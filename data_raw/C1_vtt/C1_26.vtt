00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.353
MATT: Hello everyone and welcome to Critical Role:
an online show on Twitch where a bunch of us

00:00:05.353 --> 00:00:10.531
nerdy-ass voice actors roll dice and play Dungeons
and Dragons. My name is Matthew Mercer. I'm the

00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:16.727
Dungeon Master. For returning fans, welcome, and
for new folks, prepare. A couple of fun things to

00:00:16.727 --> 00:00:21.847
announce: first things first, unfortunately we are
down a Percy this evening. Our buddy Taliesin

00:00:21.847 --> 00:00:26.566
picked up a con plague in Alaska this past
weekend. He had a great time, but came back very

00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:32.434
ill and has been trying to get better, and is
unable to make the game tonight. Which makes the

00:00:32.434 --> 00:00:39.673
current storyline a little interesting, but we'll
work it out. It's fine. No Mercy Percy is going to

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:47.986
have some business he's attending to. Thank the
Critters for that. That's an awesome hashtag! So

00:00:47.986 --> 00:00:53.694
Taliesin, I hope you feel better. We miss you.
Next week we continue that arc.

00:00:53.694 --> 00:01:01.623
Let's see, first and foremost, still every 100
subs we get on the channel we have a giveaway to

00:01:01.623 --> 00:01:06.474
someone who's active in the chatroom. The winner
of that giveaway gets a signed picture of the cast

00:01:06.474 --> 00:01:11.029
of Critical Role, as well as a signed poster by
our amazing artist Kit Buss, who was with us for

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:18.196
our last session. Those are both given away to
whoever wins that, so keep those subs going. Also,

00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:23.956
there is currently going around a hashtag: No
Shave 'Til 10k. A number of people on the stream

00:01:23.956 --> 00:01:34.265
are a part of that. All sexes can compete and be a
part of this, too. No Shave 'Til 10k. If you want

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:38.534
to be a part of that, go ahead and tweet that out.
Get that hashtag going and I'll see if I can

00:01:38.534 --> 00:01:45.486
convince Marisha to let me do that. We'll see. At
the very least, for my Halloween costume.

00:01:45.486 --> 00:01:52.322
All right, so other cool things to talk about: all
of tonight's donations are going towards the Extra

00:01:52.322 --> 00:01:58.211
Life charity. The Extra Life charity is a drive
that's part of the Children's Miracle Network

00:01:58.211 --> 00:02:02.598
Hospitals. A lot of great people in the community
have been supporting this and we're supporting

00:02:02.598 --> 00:02:08.517
that tonight. So any donations tonight will go to
Extra Life. Also over the next two days, we will

00:02:08.517 --> 00:02:15.565
also be streaming here at Geek and Sundry doing a
lot of other charity events for the Extra Life

00:02:15.565 --> 00:02:22.513
charity drive, including a small DND game-- some
of us-- on Saturday evening with the Vox Moronica

00:02:22.513 --> 00:02:31.297
crew. So that should be fun. Come check that out!
Oh, Dungeons and Dragons, the official Wizards of

00:02:31.297 --> 00:02:37.180
the Coast folks are also doing their Extra Life
stream over the next 48 hours. They're just going

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.410
to be doing live DND streams as well. So starting
tomorrow at noon through Sunday at noon, just

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.569
constant DND on the Wizards of the Coast stream as
well. And all of that is going to be raising money

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.632
for Extra Life. So you'll have a lot of things to
keep you busy this weekend essentially. So there's

00:02:53.632 --> 00:03:02.830
that. Also, we have New York Comic Con coming up
in just a couple of weeks. Excited about that, for

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.121
all you guys. We have panels on Saturday. Do we
have times for those yet?

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:11.355
LIAM: Between 1:00 and 4:00 is when we're doing
stuff.

00:03:11.355 --> 00:03:14.753
MATT: Yeah, between 1:00 and 4:00. We have about
an hour panel in there somewhere and then probably

00:03:14.753 --> 00:03:19.436
two hours of signings at the event on Saturday. So
1:00 and 4:00! Leave that period of time open.

00:03:19.436 --> 00:03:20.745
Hang out.

00:03:20.745 --> 00:03:22.367
MARISHA: We'll have prints!

00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:26.638
MATT: Exactly! And then on Sunday, outside of the
convention, because we know a lot of the badges

00:03:26.638 --> 00:03:30.270
were snatched up before this announcement even
happened and a lot of the Critters aren't able to

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.072
make it to the actual con. On Sunday, we're
looking around midday. We don't have a time or

00:03:35.072 --> 00:03:39.424
location determined yet, but that will be up on
Twitter soon. It's going to happen. We're going to

00:03:39.424 --> 00:03:43.756
have an offsite Critter meetup. Where we're going
to all be able to be there, hang out with you guys

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:50.138
and catch up, sign stuff, say hi, and have a good
time. So watch Twitter. If you don't follow us on

00:03:50.138 --> 00:03:53.943
Twitter, do it, because we'll have those
announcements coming up very soon. So excited

00:03:53.943 --> 00:03:56.159
about that. Liam, you wanted to announce--

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.472
LIAM: Yes! This is the final chance for y'all to
jump on Joe Madureira's Kickstarter, Battle

00:04:01.472 --> 00:04:06.964
Chasers: Nightwar. They have absolutely killed
their Kickstarter. They hit their goal, their

00:04:06.964 --> 00:04:11.856
initial goal about two or three days in, and they
have been hitting every single stretch goal

00:04:11.856 --> 00:04:17.116
they've had. They've got one last mystery stretch
goal left to hit. So it's a good time to get in

00:04:17.116 --> 00:04:23.826
and just get them to the very tippy, tippy top of
their campaign, which is about to end. If you guys

00:04:23.826 --> 00:04:26.681
don't know, really quick, because I've been
talking about it for two weeks: Joe Madureira,

00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:33.647
amazing comic book legend, has drawn everything.
It looks like nobody else's and has a good history

00:04:33.647 --> 00:04:38.994
in game dev as well. Created Darksiders with his
company, Vigil Games, that he helped found. And

00:04:38.994 --> 00:04:45.979
now he has founded Airship Syndicate, and they're
making an RPG in the style of JRPGs that you've

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:52.086
loved in your lives. But also with Joe's
ridonkulous art style. So go get on it.

00:04:52.086 --> 00:04:57.878
MATT: Yeah! Thank you, Liam. Orion, you wanted to
say something real fast as well.

00:04:57.878 --> 00:05:08.295
ORION: Yes. Greetings and salutations, everyone!
Last week when Kit was here-- Hi Kit, we miss

00:05:08.295 --> 00:05:16.362
you! We went to It's a Wrap over in Burbank,
California. Me and Liam and Laura and Marisha and

00:05:16.362 --> 00:05:27.295
Kit and her hubby. We were there and saw this
robe, and I think Marisha and Laura were like, try

00:05:27.295 --> 00:05:31.365
it on, and I was like, okay. And I tried it on and
was like, oh my god, it was made for me.

00:05:31.365 --> 00:05:35.692
MATT: The Tiberius robe you always knew-- or
didn't know you wanted.

00:05:35.692 --> 00:05:42.534
ORION: Yeah, totally, I was like, oh my god, and
Liam tweeted a picture about it, and then I was

00:05:42.534 --> 00:05:51.602
streaming on my stream on Twitch and somebody
mentioned the robe. And Michael Bauman-- thank you

00:05:51.602 --> 00:05:55.719
again, I'm going to thank you on Critical Role
for-- he donated $400, which was the cost of the

00:05:55.719 --> 00:06:03.510
robe, and then he just wrote in the chat, this is
for the robe, so I'm wearing the robe.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.199
LAURA: That's awesome!

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:10.538
ORION: Thank you very much. Thank you so much you
guys and all you guys who pitched in and stuff.

00:06:10.538 --> 00:06:11.775
Thank you.

00:06:11.775 --> 00:06:20.343
MATT: We'll find many cool excuses to have that
robe be displayed and utilized in many ways. I'm

00:06:20.343 --> 00:06:22.047
pretty sure he hasn't taken it off since he got
it.

00:06:22.047 --> 00:06:23.769
LAURA: Yeah, it smells really bad, you guys.

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:33.550
MATT: Awesome! Anybody else have any other
announcements before we get this party started?

00:06:33.635 --> 00:06:34.943
TRAVIS: I like cheese.

00:06:34.943 --> 00:06:36.575
MATT: Travis likes cheese, ladies and gentlemen.

00:06:36.575 --> 00:06:37.766
LAURA: That's a good announcement.

00:06:37.766 --> 00:06:43.234
MATT: I think so. It was very informative. Thank
you, Travis. All right, then. Without further ado,

00:06:43.234 --> 00:06:48.126
let's go ahead and cut to the intro and then we'll
jump right into the next episode of Critical Role.

00:06:48.126 --> 00:07:56.364
[dramatic music]

00:07:56.364 --> 00:08:03.678
MATT: Welcome back! So picking up after the events
of last week, to give you guys a little bit of a

00:08:03.678 --> 00:08:09.171
refresher. After the party had returned from their
journey into Vasselheim for quite a few weeks,

00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:17.016
they discovered upon returning that the
illustrious Briarwoods, current owners of Castle

00:08:17.016 --> 00:08:22.873
Whitestone and overseers of the entire city of
Whitestone and sticking point in Percy's

00:08:22.873 --> 00:08:32.284
background, were coming to Emon to meet for
essentially a political banquet with Sovereign

00:08:32.284 --> 00:08:38.442
Uriel Tal'Dorei to discuss construction of a
bridge. It was a very political endeavor. And the

00:08:38.442 --> 00:08:42.162
council of Tal'Dorei was invited, including Vox
Machina.

00:08:42.162 --> 00:08:49.709
There was a week of preparation in going into this
event to see exactly what the Briarwoods were

00:08:49.709 --> 00:08:59.712
about. Information was gathered at this banquet.
Vax went on his own little adventure into the

00:08:59.712 --> 00:09:06.234
Briarwoods' room, in which they nearly killed him.
(chuckles)

00:09:06.234 --> 00:09:07.738
LIAM: Hey, everybody!

00:09:07.738 --> 00:09:14.840
MATT: I didn't notice the shirt until now. So
yeah, the party rushed out to his aid. Much

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:24.567
violence ensued. The Briarwoods eventually escaped
through some sort of magical means that was not

00:09:24.567 --> 00:09:29.772
uncovered. However, they are no longer in the
picture. The party was left with a destroyed

00:09:29.772 --> 00:09:37.822
carriage, a young carriage driver who had his hand
shot off by Percy, and was then told to the guards

00:09:37.822 --> 00:09:43.683
to haul off and bring to their keep to throw into
their cell for further questioning. Uriel was

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:48.687
eventually drawn out and confused by the sudden
chaos and vehemently requested that Vox Machina

00:09:48.687 --> 00:09:55.476
return the next morning to go over what has
transpired. After which, the party during this

00:09:55.476 --> 00:09:59.760
event had encountered a tiefling by the name of
Lillith, who was masquerading as one of the

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:06.047
servants within the palace of Tal'Dorei. Aided
them in the battle and revealed that she was being

00:10:06.047 --> 00:10:13.848
hunted by her sisters in a distant land and
revealing herself here essentially opened up her

00:10:13.848 --> 00:10:21.158
physical presence to be pinpointed and then
immediately sought and hunted by whoever was after

00:10:21.158 --> 00:10:26.232
her. The party then brought her back to the keep.
They were on the way back before they were

00:10:26.232 --> 00:10:30.870
encountered by this bounty hunter and a small team
of individuals that were coming with him to seek

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:35.443
down, capture Lillith, and bring her back to her
sisters. The party then defended her in this

00:10:35.443 --> 00:10:44.867
circumstance, brutally murdering one of them.
Sorry, brutally murdering two of them. One of

00:10:44.867 --> 00:10:52.293
which was then raised and sent off as a present to
the sisters by Lillith. One was salvaged, not

00:10:52.293 --> 00:10:58.121
given an honorable death, and sent to find his way
somewhere northwest of Emon. Possibly towards

00:10:58.121 --> 00:11:05.146
Vasselheim or wherever else he may find his
adventure. They then gave Lillith the opportunity

00:11:05.146 --> 00:11:10.940
to come stay the night to rest in the keep and they
all made their way back to Greyskull Keep for the

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.328
evening. And that was where we left off.

00:11:13.328 --> 00:11:20.119
So as the evening progresses you all manage to get
your rest and gather your thoughts over the rather

00:11:20.119 --> 00:11:27.808
stressful experience you had the previous evening
within the palace. The next morning comes around.

00:11:27.808 --> 00:11:35.830
You all come to consciousness. Breakfast is
prepared by the servants of the keep. As you all

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:42.415
wake up, start getting your meals and gathering
what you want to do for the day, two individuals

00:11:42.415 --> 00:11:45.720
have not come down for their meal. Lillith and
Percy.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.116
ORION: Good morning, everyone!

00:11:49.116 --> 00:11:54.269
SAM: Not everyone. We're missing two. A male and a
female.

00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:56.504
LAURA: Oh. No.

00:11:56.504 --> 00:11:58.484
TRAVIS: You don't think?

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:00.572
LAURA: Percy was upset.

00:12:00.572 --> 00:12:02.717
SAM: Maybe he needed some comforting.

00:12:02.717 --> 00:12:05.555
ORION: Oh, I see. Are you saying they're having
relations?

00:12:05.555 --> 00:12:07.438
SAM: I'm not saying that.

00:12:07.438 --> 00:12:10.524
LAURA: Perhaps we should check on them?

00:12:10.524 --> 00:12:13.782
TRAVIS: We should totally check on them!

00:12:13.782 --> 00:12:17.376
SAM: Okay, but if there's a sock or a gun on the
doorknob, don't go in.

00:12:17.376 --> 00:12:19.849
LAURA: Or a ribbon. She wore a ribbon.

00:12:19.849 --> 00:12:26.013
ORION: Well, I was thinking last night, Grog, that
we're probably going to be here for a little bit

00:12:26.013 --> 00:12:30.812
before going anywhere. Do we go anywhere?

00:12:30.812 --> 00:12:32.880
LAURA: We have to go see Uriel.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:41.208
ORION: Who? Oh. Right! Yes! Also, I really want to
see Allura. For no particular-- actually for very

00:12:41.208 --> 00:12:42.903
specific reasons. Yes.

00:12:42.903 --> 00:12:45.230
TRAVIS: I think he's lying.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:53.166
ORION: One of them is: I want to pick up one of
the Earrings of Telecommunication. It has been

00:12:53.166 --> 00:12:57.638
finished for quite some time. We just have to go
to where she resides to pick it up. Then one of us

00:12:57.638 --> 00:12:59.246
could have another one.

00:12:59.246 --> 00:13:01.381
LIAM: That robe just takes it to a whole new
level!

00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:03.069
LAURA: Yeah, it really does.

00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:04.689
ORION: I feel so good.

00:13:04.689 --> 00:13:07.347
LIAM: I'm somewhat entranced.

00:13:07.347 --> 00:13:09.484
ORION: I'm telling you, it's helping, too.

00:13:09.484 --> 00:13:13.184
TRAVIS: Do I feel a little tingle from my belt?
And can I roll for a beard check?

00:13:13.184 --> 00:13:15.456
SAM: Oh, beard check?

00:13:15.456 --> 00:13:18.728
TRAVIS: Six. Two.

00:13:18.728 --> 00:13:25.956
MATT: You wake up, realizing that the morning has
transpired. You reach up and grab. And what you

00:13:25.956 --> 00:13:29.711
guys notice as he comes up is there is a dark
charcoal smear across one side of his face where

00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:36.500
facial hair would once be, to match the other side
that is currently beautiful quaff and shining in

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.438
the dapples of morning light that come through the
keep window.

00:13:40.438 --> 00:13:43.243
TRAVIS: You know the remedy for it, you just turn
your face in the looking glass.

00:13:43.243 --> 00:13:45.791
LAURA: Yeah, from this angle you look amazing
Grog.

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:52.726
TRAVIS: My god, I'm so handsome. Right? And then
just horror. Sheer horror.

00:13:52.726 --> 00:13:59.070
ORION: (poof) A little dust and fix that for him.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:05.845
LAURA: Oh, so it looks normal again? I like it!
Yeah. Beautiful. Don't touch it.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:09.057
MATT: The color's a little off, but it looks
better than not having it.

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:15.418
MARISHA: In my head you're like those Mr. Wooly
magnetic toys when you're a kid.

00:14:15.418 --> 00:14:21.398
TRAVIS: I would shave it and get it even, but
let's be honest, given history, it's going to take

00:14:21.398 --> 00:14:24.499
care of itself soon enough. These things don't
live very long.

00:14:24.499 --> 00:14:32.329
LAURA: I'm going to go upstairs and see if our
guest, Lillith, is all right. I don't want to

00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:33.744
disturb Percy just yet.

00:14:33.744 --> 00:14:38.409
MATT: All right. You head to the guest room. You
have one guest room upstairs that was among the

00:14:38.409 --> 00:14:39.928
rest of the rooms that you guys had constructed.

00:14:39.928 --> 00:14:41.895
TRAVIS: (singing) They're going to be getting it
on!

00:14:41.895 --> 00:14:46.412
MATT: You knock on the door. A moment passes. No
response.

00:14:46.412 --> 00:14:52.337
LAURA: Lillith? Are you with Percy? Lillith?

00:14:52.337 --> 00:14:55.517
MATT: You knock a second time and the door
(creaks) opens a little bit. It has not really

00:14:55.517 --> 00:14:57.056
been locked or closed.

00:14:57.056 --> 00:14:58.712
LAURA: I peek my head in.

00:14:58.712 --> 00:14:59.872
MATT: You peek in and look.

00:14:59.872 --> 00:15:01.247
TRAVIS: Did you check for traps?

00:15:01.247 --> 00:15:06.251
MATT: Roll a-- no, I'm kidding.

00:15:06.251 --> 00:15:07.872
(laughter)

00:15:07.872 --> 00:15:09.243
LAURA: Damn it!

00:15:09.243 --> 00:15:16.012
MATT: Already off! No. As you peek into the room,
the lights are dimmed. What little bit of candles

00:15:16.012 --> 00:15:24.346
are in there are already down. Glancing in, the
sheets are clean and set, the bed's been made, and

00:15:24.346 --> 00:15:28.208
there is a small piece of parchment that is folded
on the edge of the bed.

00:15:28.208 --> 00:15:29.956
LAURA: Go and read it.

00:15:29.956 --> 00:15:37.956
MATT: Read it? It reads, "Vox Machina, thank you
all for your hospitality and protection through

00:15:37.956 --> 00:15:46.989
"this past evening. I would stay, but the longer I
remain, the more danger I am in, and as such, put

00:15:46.989 --> 00:15:53.650
"all of you in as well. I shall travel across the
Ozmit Sea to seek the guidance of my cousin Zahra,

00:15:53.650 --> 00:16:01.373
"in hopes of finally getting out from under my
sisters' baneful gaze. Nevertheless, I wish you

00:16:01.373 --> 00:16:06.688
"all the finest of journeys, and I hope we meet
again soon. Lillith."

00:16:06.688 --> 00:16:09.453
LAURA: She's so cute.

00:16:09.453 --> 00:16:14.826
MARISHA: I liked her bow. It was cute.

00:16:14.826 --> 00:16:18.602
LAURA: I tell everyone that she's gone. Gone.

00:16:18.602 --> 00:16:22.861
TRAVIS: No, she's in Percy's room! Scanlan, let's
go see if he's banging!

00:16:22.861 --> 00:16:23.874
SAM: All right, let's go!

00:16:23.874 --> 00:16:25.831
(laughter)

00:16:25.831 --> 00:16:30.425
MATT: You run up and Percy's room is-- the door is
already partially ajar.

00:16:30.425 --> 00:16:31.666
TRAVIS: (boom)

00:16:31.666 --> 00:16:39.113
MATT: It bursts open. (wham) Slams on the side of
the door, looking in the room. He's not there, is

00:16:39.113 --> 00:16:44.463
the first thing you notice. However, what you do
see are a series of different books of sketches

00:16:44.463 --> 00:16:51.045
and designs and half-concocted blueprints for
different things are crumpled and torn across the

00:16:51.045 --> 00:16:55.371
room. The bedsheets are thrown off the bed. It
looks like the room has been continuously tossed

00:16:55.371 --> 00:17:00.127
through some sort of frenzied action, either
seeking something or just out of emotional

00:17:00.127 --> 00:17:04.511
frustration. This room is left in far more
disarray than you're used to seeing true to

00:17:04.511 --> 00:17:05.932
Percy's character.

00:17:05.932 --> 00:17:08.376
SAM: My god, Grog. Percy's a hoarder.

00:17:08.376 --> 00:17:10.793
TRAVIS: Right.

00:17:10.793 --> 00:17:13.069
SAM: Or he's in serious distress.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.558
TRAVIS: I think it's the previous.

00:17:15.558 --> 00:17:16.897
SAM: The hoarder?

00:17:16.897 --> 00:17:18.459
TRAVIS: Yeah. Probably.

00:17:18.459 --> 00:17:24.064
SAM: We must find him, don't you think? Our
friend's in trouble. I proceed down to his

00:17:24.064 --> 00:17:27.842
tinkering lab. Doesn't he have some sort of lab
downstairs?

00:17:27.842 --> 00:17:30.197
TRAVIS: My room's like shit, and I'm not in
trouble.

00:17:30.197 --> 00:17:32.211
SAM: Well, that goes with your character.

00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:35.829
MATT: Yeah. You head down to the basement area,
and to the right is the cell, to the left is the

00:17:35.829 --> 00:17:43.126
workshop. The workshop door is currently closed.
There is a small slider eye vent where you can

00:17:43.126 --> 00:17:44.594
peek through.

00:17:44.594 --> 00:17:46.298
SAM: Can I reach the eye vent?

00:17:46.298 --> 00:17:49.250
MATT: You can if you leap hard enough and catch it
on the edge.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.767
TRAVIS: I boost him up.

00:17:50.767 --> 00:18:01.008
MATT: Okay. Looking inside, you can see, the forge
is aglow. You hear the tangs of metal being

00:18:01.008 --> 00:18:06.634
hammered against the anvil, and you can see the
form of Percy framed against the backlighting of

00:18:06.634 --> 00:18:09.668
the forge. He's feverishly working away on some
sort of project.

00:18:09.668 --> 00:18:11.063
TRAVIS: Is he naked?

00:18:11.063 --> 00:18:17.201
SAM: No, he's working too hard. Maybe we should
just leave him be. Seems focused, driven, like a

00:18:17.201 --> 00:18:18.318
madman.

00:18:18.318 --> 00:18:21.275
TRAVIS: Oh. I get it. Like a madman?

00:18:21.275 --> 00:18:23.128
SAM: I don't think you do.

00:18:23.128 --> 00:18:27.853
MATT: At which point a voice rings out from across
the room: Percy unmoving, still continuing his

00:18:27.853 --> 00:18:34.901
work, shouts over his shoulder, "Please, leave me
be. I have a lot to think about right now."

00:18:34.901 --> 00:18:37.894
SAM: Would you like a meal brought down?

00:18:37.894 --> 00:18:45.789
MATT: "I'm fine. Thank you. Really. I need some
time."

00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:50.753
SAM: All right. If you're making things, a little
ladder for the little perch here might be nice.

00:18:50.753 --> 00:18:54.754
Just in the future! But not now. That seems low
priority.

00:18:54.754 --> 00:18:58.504
MATT: He stops his banging, walks over and
scribbles something on a paper, then goes back to

00:18:58.504 --> 00:19:01.291
banging. "Noted." (clanging)

00:19:01.291 --> 00:19:07.214
TRAVIS: I drop Scanlan and I lean in and I go,
beware the water! It burns!

00:19:07.214 --> 00:19:11.911
MATT: "Yes. Yes, it does, Grog. Good boy."

00:19:11.911 --> 00:19:20.808
SAM: All right. So we go back up. Tell the
fellows, Percy's in a mood. He's creating right

00:19:20.808 --> 00:19:22.895
now. I think we should just leave him be.

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:23.881
LAURA: Understandable.

00:19:23.881 --> 00:19:25.250
LIAM: Let him get it out of his system.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.128
MARISHA: I'm really worried about him.

00:19:27.128 --> 00:19:28.523
SAM: Yes.

00:19:28.523 --> 00:19:38.042
ORION: Matthew? Rolling-- 12. I'm just trying to
teach my pet something but I rolled a 12.

00:19:38.042 --> 00:19:40.801
MATT: For?

00:19:40.801 --> 00:19:43.093
ORION: Oh, I want it to follow. To follow.

00:19:43.093 --> 00:19:53.100
MATT: To follow. Okay. You gather, based on the
recent intensity of trying to teach things to

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:58.891
Lockheed over the past week. You succeed in a few.
There is a bit of balking frustration that perhaps

00:19:58.891 --> 00:20:06.491
you've overstepped a little bit, and Lockheed
feels maybe there's less of a friendship here more

00:20:06.491 --> 00:20:10.828
than a real master-servant relationship, at least
in this moment, and does not seem to be receptive

00:20:10.828 --> 00:20:12.431
to your attempt.

00:20:12.431 --> 00:20:14.889
ORION: He's in a mood, also. Why is everybody in a
mood today?

00:20:14.889 --> 00:20:19.341
SAM: I know. Percy's hate-smelting downstairs.

00:20:19.341 --> 00:20:23.452
LAURA: Percy has good reason to hate-smelt. He
seems rather disturbed that the Briarwoods got

00:20:23.452 --> 00:20:24.463
away.

00:20:24.463 --> 00:20:27.335
SAM: Yes. I feel responsible.

00:20:27.335 --> 00:20:36.515
\MARISHA: Out of curiosity, did anyone else hear
him-- did anyone else just happen to hear what he

00:20:36.515 --> 00:20:39.312
said in that fight last night?

00:20:39.312 --> 00:20:47.428
LAURA: I was a little bit preoccupied by watching
him shoot a servant boy over and over and over

00:20:47.428 --> 00:20:48.741
again.

00:20:48.741 --> 00:20:50.800
MARISHA: It was after that, actually.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.551
LAURA: What did he say?

00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:57.230
MARISHA: Never mind.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.727
SAM: What? No, spit it out. What did he say? It
seems important.

00:21:00.727 --> 00:21:05.963
MARISHA: It's hard to say. You know Percy. I don't
know where he gets these lines.

00:21:05.963 --> 00:21:08.279
SAM: Is it fuck? Is it shit?

00:21:08.279 --> 00:21:10.629
TRAVIS: Cock! Bulls! Dong! Wang!

00:21:10.629 --> 00:21:11.880
LIAM: Steampunk!

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.496
MARISHA: Jeez. Okay.

00:21:13.496 --> 00:21:14.919
TRAVIS: Donkey wang!

00:21:14.919 --> 00:21:17.304
MARISHA: This is getting really off subject.

00:21:17.304 --> 00:21:19.559
ORION: I'm going to go down to my laboratory.

00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:21.050
LAURA: What did he say?

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:32.920
MARISHA: It was when he was screaming the cluster
of things as he was shooting that mercenary in the

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:45.124
face, and he said, "What are you doing? You have
no reason to be here. Your soul is now forfeit."

00:21:45.124 --> 00:21:51.862
Really, that last part is the most important one.
The first stuff is fairly average. But yeah, "Your

00:21:51.862 --> 00:21:54.642
"soul is now forfeit."

00:21:54.642 --> 00:21:55.989
TRAVIS: It's a good line.

00:21:55.989 --> 00:21:57.400
LAURA: It's a really good line.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.533
SAM: Thought he was just trash-talking. You think
there's more to it?

00:21:59.533 --> 00:22:08.866
MARISHA: I thought it was maybe a line and then it
seemed really aggressive and strong and specific,

00:22:08.866 --> 00:22:15.120
so it made me think a lot. I don't know.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.999
LAURA: Did you ask him about it at all?

00:22:16.999 --> 00:22:18.955
MARISHA: We haven't seen him since that happened.

00:22:18.955 --> 00:22:20.514
TRAVIS: What do you think?

00:22:20.514 --> 00:22:27.513
LAURA: What, do you think his Pepperbox is--
what?

00:22:27.513 --> 00:22:31.548
MARISHA: I think he's not telling us everything,
that's for sure.

00:22:31.548 --> 00:22:33.287
SAM: Well, we all have some secrets.

00:22:33.287 --> 00:22:41.550
MARISHA: Yeah. But screaming, "Your soul is now
forfeit?" That's not a secret. That's saying you

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.423
peed the bed when you were a kid.

00:22:43.423 --> 00:22:47.454
LIAM: I worry, too, but he did lose his entire
family.

00:22:47.454 --> 00:22:49.693
LAURA: He did pee the bed when he was a kid.

00:22:49.693 --> 00:22:51.066
MARISHA: Oh, really?

00:22:51.066 --> 00:22:55.844
LIAM: I am assuming. But he lost his entire family
to those people.

00:22:55.844 --> 00:23:01.365
MARISHA: Sure. But he wasn't screaming this at the
Briarwoods. He was screaming this at a random

00:23:01.365 --> 00:23:02.680
mercenary.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.044
LAURA: Well?

00:23:04.044 --> 00:23:05.744
MARISHA: What does that mean?

00:23:05.744 --> 00:23:07.612
TRAVIS: Maybe his soul is forfeit.

00:23:07.612 --> 00:23:09.059
MARISHA: To what?

00:23:09.059 --> 00:23:11.120
TRAVIS: Death?

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.119
LAURA: Maybe we keep an eye on Percy.

00:23:14.119 --> 00:23:22.871
SAM: That's a fair point, though. We'll keep an
eye on him. He seems to be in a fragile state

00:23:22.871 --> 00:23:24.498
right now.

00:23:24.498 --> 00:23:27.563
LAURA: Percy's not the one who killed a poor old
woman, though.

00:23:27.563 --> 00:23:34.553
SAM: Did we kill her? I thought we just made her
sleep and then walked away.

00:23:34.553 --> 00:23:36.642
TRAVIS: Nope. No. Total massacre.

00:23:36.642 --> 00:23:39.043
LAURA: Tiberius destroyed her.

00:23:39.043 --> 00:23:41.595
SAM: Tiberius, you killed an old woman?

00:23:41.595 --> 00:23:43.496
ORION: I'm not there.

00:23:43.496 --> 00:23:50.265
MARISHA: Yeah, that's actually another thing I
wanted to talk about. That was also really

00:23:50.265 --> 00:23:57.924
intense. You know, I get it. It was a hard day. It
was a hard day, and we tend to get a little

00:23:57.924 --> 00:24:05.810
aggressive sometimes after hard days. We've all
been there. But he didn't just murder an old

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:13.953
woman. He chainsawed her. A sleeping, unconscious
woman.

00:24:13.953 --> 00:24:16.797
TRAVIS: It was pretty great!

00:24:16.797 --> 00:24:22.098
SAM: Are you saying that we should take it down a
notch? Or maybe not brutally destroy the bad

00:24:22.098 --> 00:24:23.435
guys?

00:24:23.435 --> 00:24:30.734
MARISHA: You also were the only other one who
seemed to be confused as to what was going on.

00:24:30.734 --> 00:24:39.627
LAURA: I shot her. I shot her in the back. Let's
be honest. I didn't chainsaw her, but I did shoot

00:24:39.627 --> 00:24:41.368
her in the back as she was running away.

00:24:41.368 --> 00:24:43.325
SAM: I made her go to sleep. That was peaceful.

00:24:43.325 --> 00:24:47.779
MARISHA: That's what I'm saying. That was good.
That was nice.

00:24:47.779 --> 00:24:49.921
LAURA: I was aiming for her shoulder, if it
makes any difference.

00:24:49.921 --> 00:24:53.480
TRAVIS: She did have that sweet little run, which
was so cute.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:25:00.802
SAM: Are you taking moral exception to some of our
behavior?

00:25:00.802 --> 00:25:05.750
MARISHA: That might exactly be what I'm saying.
Man, you see this is why I like you, Scanlan.

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:12.073
You're so much better at the words than me. I
don't think I even knew that's what I felt until

00:25:12.073 --> 00:25:13.624
you said it just now.

00:25:13.624 --> 00:25:22.770
SAM: Well, this is something perhaps you should
pray on and think on. If there's something you'd

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:27.167
like us to change about our behavior, we can
consider that. We're all friends. We're allies

00:25:27.167 --> 00:25:29.978
here. We should pay respect to you.

00:25:29.978 --> 00:25:33.024
MARISHA: I just don't want us to--

00:25:33.024 --> 00:25:39.297
LIAM: It's a fair point. We don't want to be
corrupted by the very evil that we mean to stamp

00:25:39.297 --> 00:25:46.551
out in this world. She was trying to kill us. But
your point is taken.

00:25:46.551 --> 00:25:50.066
MARISHA: She was a really old woman.

00:25:50.066 --> 00:25:53.833
LIAM: But she wasn't the secretary. She was trying
to kill.

00:25:53.833 --> 00:25:56.656
MARISHA: Sure. But she was unconscious.

00:25:56.656 --> 00:25:58.928
TRAVIS: She actually didn't do anything, either.

00:25:58.928 --> 00:26:01.578
MARISHA: Yeah, she didn't really do anything at
all.

00:26:01.578 --> 00:26:03.078
TRAVIS: She could have been taking notes.

00:26:03.078 --> 00:26:04.683
LAURA: She had a wand!

00:26:04.683 --> 00:26:09.998
MARISHA: I'm not saying she wasn't a threat and
I'm not saying we shouldn't handle threats. I'm

00:26:09.998 --> 00:26:17.561
saying maybe we shouldn't dissect a woman with a
spinning Krull blade who's sleeping on the ground.

00:26:17.561 --> 00:26:22.612
Defenseless, running away. She was fleeing.

00:26:22.612 --> 00:26:27.681
SAM: All right. You know, this is constructive
criticism, and we'll take it as such. And I, for

00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:34.344
one, will maybe not desecrate and denigrate
bodies.

00:26:34.344 --> 00:26:37.693
LAURA: Just beds! And temples. (laughs)

00:26:37.693 --> 00:26:41.808
LIAM: I don't know! I mean, I see what Keyleth's
saying, but I don't really want to cramp your

00:26:41.808 --> 00:26:43.429
style, Scanlan.

00:26:43.429 --> 00:26:47.476
SAM: Oh, I'll shit on things. Maybe not people.

00:26:47.476 --> 00:26:52.832
LIAM: We're like the A-Team, and that's your
specialty. I don't really want to-- See, you

00:26:52.832 --> 00:26:54.669
should just shit when you feel the urge.

00:26:54.669 --> 00:26:56.535
LAURA: What time is it? Do we need to be getting
to Uriel?

00:26:56.535 --> 00:26:57.931
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, what time is it?

00:26:57.931 --> 00:27:00.926
MATT: At this point, it's probably pushing on 11
am, close to noon.

00:27:00.926 --> 00:27:04.549
LAURA: We should probably be getting to the
palace.

00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:10.308
MATT: Tiberius, what did you say you were doing
down there? What did you say you were doing down

00:27:10.308 --> 00:27:12.437
in your laboratory?

00:27:12.437 --> 00:27:18.378
ORION: Well, I was doing my research on that stuff
last night and this morning.

00:27:18.378 --> 00:27:20.325
MATT: Your which one?

00:27:20.325 --> 00:27:23.965
ORION: It's just my ability because of my class. I
do the backstory.

00:27:23.965 --> 00:27:26.184
MATT: Your backstory is?

00:27:26.184 --> 00:27:29.953
ORION: I am a noble sage.

00:27:29.953 --> 00:27:32.609
MATT: Well, there's a noble and there's a sage.

00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:39.734
ORION: Yeah, I know, and I spliced them because it
made sense. No. The noble part is the RP. The sage

00:27:39.734 --> 00:27:41.230
is the perk.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:44.050
MATT: Okay. Gotcha. That's good to know. All
right.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:50.807
ORION: And I was writing down the sigil to the
keep. That's completed.

00:27:50.807 --> 00:28:03.550
MATT: Okay. So the sigil is there for you. All
right. And so as the sage-- All right. Okay. So

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:08.978
yeah. Not difficult to research. There are a
number of books. They're older books and things

00:28:08.978 --> 00:28:12.975
that were installed as part of the construction of
this laboratory for you, and information that you

00:28:12.975 --> 00:28:20.168
have gathered since. There are various bestiaries
and gatherings of information about the dangerous

00:28:20.168 --> 00:28:24.352
denizens in the countryside around you, and it is
a very dangerous place outside of the few points

00:28:24.352 --> 00:28:27.990
of civilized society that has built up its own
defenses.

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:33.767
Throughout the evening and the morning, you've
managed to find eventually a piece that talks

00:28:33.767 --> 00:28:40.298
about various undead entities and the process of
undeath, and necromantic magics that have been

00:28:40.298 --> 00:28:48.167
perverted throughout the generations to defy the
natural cycle of life. You do come across an entry

00:28:48.167 --> 00:28:55.469
about vampirism. It is extremely rare and was
largely thought abolished close to 200 years ago.

00:28:55.469 --> 00:29:02.565
There are very rare whispers of any sort of cases
out there, and usually as soon as something comes

00:29:02.565 --> 00:29:12.038
to any sort of public knowledge, large mobs gather
and whoever was infected with this horrible state

00:29:12.038 --> 00:29:14.355
was hunted down and killed.

00:29:14.355 --> 00:29:21.558
What you do learn from this is religious
symbology, while classically thought to have an

00:29:21.558 --> 00:29:26.649
effect on people afflicted with vampirism,
actually has no effect. It's more of a

00:29:26.649 --> 00:29:33.577
superstition, but does not actually have any
negative impact on the individual. However,

00:29:33.577 --> 00:29:46.010
certain things that do render a vampire easier to
destroy: the presence of sunlight. Anything that

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:50.537
counts as sunlight can damage them progressively
the longer they're in it, prevent them from

00:29:50.537 --> 00:29:56.405
restoring their health, and ultimately destroy
them and turn them to ash, should they be brought

00:29:56.405 --> 00:30:02.179
to the brink of death in the presence of sunlight.
Also, very quickly and consistently rushing

00:30:02.179 --> 00:30:11.856
water. Being held into a rushing stream or under a
waterfall would have a similar effect to sunlight.

00:30:11.856 --> 00:30:19.330
You do also know the stake in the heart is also
considered to be a way to destroy them. It does

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:24.149
not actually destroy them, but it does render them
paralyzed and has to be done when they're in their

00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:33.060
resting place, within their coffin and/or the dirt
that is considered their resting location. Usually

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:37.708
that is the beginning step: to find and locate
where the vampire is resting, stake in the heart,

00:30:37.708 --> 00:30:41.769
and then carry the body to sunlight or rushing
water. And that's how they're permanently

00:30:41.769 --> 00:30:45.681
destroyed. You also find out that if a vampire is
thought to be killed under any other

00:30:45.681 --> 00:30:51.158
circumstances, the body turns to mist and is nigh
invulnerable and eventually finds its way back to

00:30:51.158 --> 00:30:55.412
wherever they've hidden their resting place to
recover within a very short period of time, making

00:30:55.412 --> 00:30:59.864
them extremely dangerous, unless you have the
right situation, the right conditions, to bring

00:30:59.864 --> 00:31:02.679
them to that point. So that information is now at
your disposal.

00:31:02.679 --> 00:31:05.835
ORION: Wonderful.

00:31:05.835 --> 00:31:09.873
TRAVIS: Do you want to tell us what you've
learned?

00:31:09.873 --> 00:31:23.356
ORION: I did it right this time! Knowing that, I
take some files and-- I want to check if I can--

00:31:23.356 --> 00:31:27.451
Nope. I can't do anything yet. That's it. I'm
going to go upstairs.

00:31:27.451 --> 00:31:34.538
MATT: Okay. So as you guys have gathered the time
and what you might be, going forward, doing for

00:31:34.538 --> 00:31:39.186
the rest of the day, Tiberius comes upstairs with
a bit of a smile and an air of confidence.

00:31:39.186 --> 00:31:40.693
LAURA: Oh good, you're back.

00:31:40.693 --> 00:31:47.777
LIAM: Tibs, we were just discussing the future of
the group and the direction we've been taking. And

00:31:47.777 --> 00:31:55.937
a point was introduced that maybe perhaps, we
started as a sort of a-- mercenary group is a bit

00:31:55.937 --> 00:32:02.631
strong-- but this alliance we have formed out of
convenience. We all needed to eat. But now that

00:32:02.631 --> 00:32:09.928
we're at the stature we are, in a keep, in Emon.
Friends to the emperor. We want to figure out what

00:32:09.928 --> 00:32:15.398
we're doing here. Do we want to be just powerful
badasses who walk around getting what they want,

00:32:15.398 --> 00:32:21.354
or are we trying to enact some positive change in
this world?

00:32:21.354 --> 00:32:28.410
ORION: Yes, absolutely. That's what my items are
for. I've only found one of them. There are still

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:35.503
three or four, if they even exist out there. There
are countless things to go and venture forth and

00:32:35.503 --> 00:32:36.948
explore.

00:32:36.948 --> 00:32:38.492
TRAVIS: What? Your items?

00:32:38.492 --> 00:32:44.823
ORION: The artifacts, the Ring of Boros, the old
hag. That is the next step in my quest. She told

00:32:44.823 --> 00:32:47.332
us it would be in the Feywood. Right?

00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:51.412
MATT: Feywild. Close. Researcher.

00:32:51.412 --> 00:33:03.110
ORION: That is where we need to go. But that's why
we ran into her in Vasselheim, and she

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.012
wouldn't tell me anything more.

00:33:05.012 --> 00:33:09.910
MARISHA: How do you plan to use your items? For
better good in the world?

00:33:10.065 --> 00:33:14.962
ORION: Well, you've seen how I've used my Mending
Wheel. Countless ways.

00:33:14.962 --> 00:33:19.584
TRAVIS: Yeah, thank you. You healed my cask. I'll
always be grateful.

00:33:19.584 --> 00:33:24.919
ORION: Moreover, it would prove to the council
that all of the things that I went on this journey

00:33:24.919 --> 00:33:31.285
for to begin with, it was true. Or for naught. And
really, to gain the respect of my father and

00:33:31.285 --> 00:33:39.453
everyone else. You don't know how hard it is to be
a chromatic dragon in a metallic world! It's not

00:33:39.453 --> 00:33:40.417
easy.

00:33:40.417 --> 00:33:45.438
LIAM: Well, there's no question that you are an
invaluable member of Vox Machina, and our friend,

00:33:45.438 --> 00:33:47.622
and our family. And that is not in question.

00:33:47.622 --> 00:33:55.307
ORION: Of course. Which is why I have pledged my
loyalty to you all. And I need your strength, as

00:33:55.307 --> 00:34:00.046
well. There is no way I could accomplish in my
mission alone. I mean, Grog, when I ran into you

00:34:00.046 --> 00:34:06.037
in that one bar. How many men were you beating up?
I counted eight, if I recall.

00:34:06.037 --> 00:34:07.398
TRAVIS: I think that sounds right.

00:34:07.398 --> 00:34:08.799
SAM: He can't count.

00:34:08.799 --> 00:34:10.251
TRAVIS: It's that many.

00:34:10.251 --> 00:34:17.267
ORION: Here was this brute who I would have ran
away from, but here you were, and I found you to

00:34:17.267 --> 00:34:23.762
be rather charming. I figured, well, that's some
good company to keep, rather. And then I met the

00:34:23.762 --> 00:34:26.514
rest of you, and look where we are now!

00:34:26.514 --> 00:34:31.690
LAURA: Yes. Tiberius, the point of this is you
killed an old woman last night, very brutally.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:34.297
Please maybe don't do that again.

00:34:34.297 --> 00:34:38.501
ORION: She felt nothing, but of course. And I was
giving my new Krull blade a good old try.

00:34:38.501 --> 00:34:44.314
LAURA: Yes, you were. Maybe not on sleeping people
anymore. People who are actually attacking us.

00:34:44.314 --> 00:34:47.254
ORION: She was-- okay, fine.

00:34:47.254 --> 00:34:59.286
LIAM: Well, I think the point is your abilities in
arcane wonder are expanding daily. Exponentially.

00:34:59.286 --> 00:35:04.878
And perhaps be a little tentative. Do a little
practice run in the woods on your own, once in

00:35:04.878 --> 00:35:08.999
a while, and see what the effects are before you go
whipping it out.

00:35:08.999 --> 00:35:10.982
ORION: Are there woods nearby?

00:35:10.982 --> 00:35:18.722
SAM: This is an intervention. We love you very
much, but you killed an old lady.

00:35:18.722 --> 00:35:20.659
TRAVIS: I like the way you kill people.

00:35:20.659 --> 00:35:22.508
ORION: Well, yes.

00:35:22.508 --> 00:35:24.744
LAURA: We're all on the up and up now, right?

00:35:24.744 --> 00:35:28.138
ORION: One raises a hand to me or Vox Machina,
they are going to die.

00:35:28.138 --> 00:35:29.788
TRAVIS: Yeah! Yeah, they are!

00:35:29.788 --> 00:35:33.059
ORION: It is simple. I do not know why this is a
discussion. I won't be as cruel--

00:35:33.059 --> 00:35:40.192
MARISHA: You know, she didn't even really do
anything. She was really old.

00:35:40.192 --> 00:35:41.807
LAURA: She was attacking us.

00:35:41.807 --> 00:35:43.226
LIAM: Keyleth.

00:35:43.226 --> 00:35:44.715
MARISHA: What?

00:35:44.715 --> 00:35:50.796
LIAM: Clearly, we all love you as family, and
nobody blames you, but you once killed a child,

00:35:50.796 --> 00:35:52.954
and none of us blame you for that.

00:35:52.954 --> 00:35:56.373
TRAVIS: Is it too early to start drinking? I pull
out the cask of ale.

00:35:56.373 --> 00:35:58.652
LIAM: And that happened in the heat of battle.

00:35:58.652 --> 00:36:04.423
MARISHA: You know, I'm really sensitive about
that, Vax. I'm &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; sensitive about that,

00:36:04.423 --> 00:36:05.425
Vax!

00:36:05.425 --> 00:36:06.825
LIAM: I'm well aware.

00:36:06.825 --> 00:36:10.377
MARISHA: And that was different.

00:36:10.377 --> 00:36:12.456
LAURA: It was an accident!

00:36:12.456 --> 00:36:16.134
MARISHA: That was pretty fucking deliberate, what
he did.

00:36:16.134 --> 00:36:21.472
ORION: Yes, to someone who was opposing us. That
was a child who was innocent. Or was he opposing

00:36:21.472 --> 00:36:23.309
us, too? I don't remember, actually.

00:36:23.309 --> 00:36:25.094
LIAM: And it all falls apart.

00:36:25.094 --> 00:36:28.293
MARISHA: He was being puppeted by sorcerer Michael
Jackson.

00:36:28.293 --> 00:36:36.580
LIAM: No one agrees with you today more than I,
and I think we can adjust our perspective

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.074
slightly. Right, Grog?

00:36:38.074 --> 00:36:39.732
TRAVIS: What's the word?

00:36:39.732 --> 00:36:41.039
LIAM: See?

00:36:41.039 --> 00:36:42.794
SAM: Kill softer.

00:36:42.794 --> 00:36:46.440
ORION: I'll show you how. You just have to do it
really slow.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:50.147
LAURA: Uriel's waiting for us.

00:36:50.147 --> 00:36:57.836
SAM: Let's table this. We'll stick a pin in this
discussion. We'll all be thinking long and hard

00:36:57.836 --> 00:36:58.849
about this.

00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:00.933
LAURA: Keyleth, it wasn't intentional and
everybody knows that.

00:37:00.933 --> 00:37:02.928
LIAM: Absolutely. Not intentional. No.

00:37:02.928 --> 00:37:06.143
MARISHA: I turn into Minxie and start walking.

00:37:06.143 --> 00:37:10.512
TRAVIS: Minxie! I go and give a little scratch
behind the ears.

00:37:10.512 --> 00:37:13.474
MATT: You guys gather and make your way into the
city of Emon proper.

00:37:13.474 --> 00:37:20.494
LAURA: Actually, before we head towards Uriel, we
probably should-- do we have any sort of proof

00:37:20.494 --> 00:37:25.176
that the Briarwoods actually did horrible things
and it wasn't us attacking them?

00:37:25.176 --> 00:37:27.524
LIAM: Well, I've got these little scars right
here.

00:37:27.524 --> 00:37:31.329
MATT: The scars are still there. They're still
wounds that are healing.

00:37:31.329 --> 00:37:38.503
LAURA: All right. Cool. Just making sure that we
had something.

00:37:38.503 --> 00:37:41.473
LIAM: And then there was what's-his-name, Awesome
Pants, who was there.

00:37:41.473 --> 00:37:43.227
LAURA: Seeker Asum.

00:37:43.227 --> 00:37:45.059
ORION: Allura saw everything, as well.

00:37:45.059 --> 00:37:46.719
SAM: Did she see the fight?

00:37:46.719 --> 00:37:48.324
LAURA: Allura didn't see the fight.

00:37:48.324 --> 00:37:55.034
LIAM: We know she knows what's up, but whether she
can be used as a reliable witness is-- we've got

00:37:55.034 --> 00:37:57.424
multiple witnesses.

00:37:57.424 --> 00:38:01.228
SAM: There were those guards, too. There was
guards outside the door.

00:38:01.228 --> 00:38:02.927
LIAM: They were incinerated.

00:38:02.927 --> 00:38:04.261
SAM: Oh yeah.

00:38:04.261 --> 00:38:06.409
LAURA: Plus, they were the Briarwoods' guards,
anyway.

00:38:06.409 --> 00:38:08.070
ORION: One of them was still alive. I didn't kill
both of them.

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:10.229
LAURA: He went away with the Briarwoods, I'm going
to assume.

00:38:10.229 --> 00:38:13.964
TRAVIS: What a dick! We go to see Uriel.

00:38:13.964 --> 00:38:15.624
MATT: Okay.

00:38:15.624 --> 00:38:20.462
TRAVIS: I made a choice for the team!

00:38:20.462 --> 00:38:24.313
(laughter)

00:38:24.313 --> 00:38:29.982
MATT: As you're having this discussion, all of you
make your way into the city of Emon, across the

00:38:29.982 --> 00:38:34.292
districts to the Cloudtop. You're greeted and let
within the gate into the central district there.

00:38:34.292 --> 00:38:40.506
You make your way to the palace of Tal'Dorei,
through the front doors. The guards that are there

00:38:40.506 --> 00:38:46.947
lead you in and one of them says, "Uriel is
waiting within the throne chamber." You guys are

00:38:46.947 --> 00:38:49.552
led down the main hallway into the very center of
the palace.

00:38:49.552 --> 00:38:51.964
MARISHA: I come out of Minxie.

00:38:51.964 --> 00:38:57.605
MATT: The nervous guard, thankfully, puts his
weapon away and is like, "Oh! Lady Keyleth, my

00:38:57.605 --> 00:38:59.941
"apologies." And puts his spear to the side.

00:38:59.941 --> 00:39:02.142
LAURA: Trinket's still here, though.

00:39:02.142 --> 00:39:09.059
LIAM: I buzz over to that specific guard and say,
do you have a lost and found here? I have this

00:39:09.059 --> 00:39:15.920
really badass serpent-style belt. Sometimes it
crawls around on its own. Sometimes it's just a

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:21.429
belt. And I lost it here the other night. And I'm
really hoping-- I mean, it ties everything

00:39:21.429 --> 00:39:24.569
together. Is there anyone I can check with?

00:39:24.569 --> 00:39:31.458
MATT: "Check back after you've spoken with the
Sovereign, please. Thank you." Leads you guys on.

00:39:31.458 --> 00:39:35.713
As you head down the main hallway-- and you recall
this hallway. This was a long, dangerous trek the

00:39:35.713 --> 00:39:39.449
first time you came to the palace. This was where
Uriel's family was possessed. This is where you

00:39:39.449 --> 00:39:45.316
had your battle with the glabrezu. This is where
Pike was slain. This is where you had to pull the

00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:50.218
shadows from the bodies of his family. This is a
very emotional place that you really haven't been

00:39:50.218 --> 00:39:58.832
to since that sequence of events. Walking in
already has this tenuous state of low-simmering

00:39:58.832 --> 00:40:03.958
energy. As you're brought into the main chamber,
you can see there is the dual thrones for Uriel

00:40:03.958 --> 00:40:07.432
and his wife. His wife is not present; his family
is not present, just Uriel sitting on the throne.

00:40:07.432 --> 00:40:12.578
There are a few guards on the different entrances
to the room. As you walk in, Uriel just sits there

00:40:12.578 --> 00:40:18.371
on the throne and gives you acknowledgment and
ushers you into the room. You all step in. Trinket

00:40:18.371 --> 00:40:22.845
behind you keeping an eye out. Like a bear is wont
to do.

00:40:22.845 --> 00:40:30.408
You guys make your way up towards the very edge of
the central raised dais where the thrones are

00:40:30.408 --> 00:40:38.332
currently set up on. You now see on the opposite
side of the room, Seeker Asum and Allura walk in,

00:40:38.332 --> 00:40:45.654
as well as Arbiter Brom, who is the cleric that is
the Master of Law in the city. They walk up and

00:40:45.654 --> 00:40:52.020
flank the sides of the throne, stepping back a
little bit to not gather all the attention, but

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:59.881
definitely be there as a show of support. As they
enter, the doors on the other side of the room and the

00:40:59.881 --> 00:41:07.821
door behind you open, and roughly 30 guards enter
the chamber quietly. They all filter in, blocking

00:41:07.821 --> 00:41:14.826
all the exits. The doors close. No weapons are
drawn, but there is a very strong showing of

00:41:14.826 --> 00:41:18.500
muscle in this room that you weren't expecting for
this meeting.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:24.599
Once all the guards are settled and a really
awkward silence hits the room, Uriel stands up

00:41:24.599 --> 00:41:34.263
from the throne and looks upon you. Pacing
slightly, back and forth. "Thank you all for

00:41:34.263 --> 00:41:42.869
"joining me. I must say, I am troubled by recent
events, and I wish to speak to you regarding them

00:41:42.869 --> 00:41:51.651
"before taking any action. I owe you that much for
all you've done for me. Before you left for

00:41:51.651 --> 00:42:01.372
"Vasselheim, you showed immediate interest in the
Briarwoods. Percy in-- Where is Percival?"

00:42:01.372 --> 00:42:12.280
SAM: Well, he's not feeling well today after the
events of last night, so he stayed behind.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:22.723
MATT: "Well, then please relay this conversation
to him as soon as you see him. You exhibited

00:42:22.723 --> 00:42:28.469
"interest in the Briarwoods before leaving for
Vasselheim. I, through trust, did not inquire as

00:42:28.469 --> 00:42:34.232
"to why. But upon your return, eagerly told you
they were coming to this feast and invited you as

00:42:34.232 --> 00:42:39.078
"part of the Council of Tal'Dorei to join this
feast, as it was your request. I graciously

00:42:39.078 --> 00:42:45.302
"followed through. You showed up. A meal was had.
Questions were asked, although curious ones; I did

00:42:45.302 --> 00:42:55.831
"not pry. Now I have since been notified, and seen
a bit of the aftermath, that you, Vox Machina,

00:42:55.831 --> 00:43:07.153
"seemingly attacked our guests shortly-- please.
Listen. Attacked our guests shortly after the meal

00:43:07.153 --> 00:43:13.754
"in their own guest quarters. Forcing them to flee,
after you destroyed the hallway, ruined their

00:43:13.754 --> 00:43:22.611
"carriage, murdered two of their guards, two more
outside, and leaving Seeker Asum to witness this

00:43:22.611 --> 00:43:30.700
"entire process." Asum gives a nod. "You then
tortured their carriage driver, requested he be

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:36.081
"sent to the dungeon beneath your keep. And upon my
sentries returning from Greyskull to deliver him,

00:43:36.081 --> 00:43:43.084
"they find a freshly murdered old woman not far
behind the path you took. Not long after, Seeker

00:43:43.084 --> 00:43:48.852
"Asum found me and corroborated most of this
unexpected, violent behavior. I then asked Arbiter

00:43:48.852 --> 00:43:54.775
"Brom here to divine the nature of this murder. And
through his divine sight, through the goddess

00:43:54.775 --> 00:44:00.923
"Ioun, comes to tell me it was none other than you,
Tiberius, that slaughtered this elderly woman

00:44:00.923 --> 00:44:02.738
"while she slept."

00:44:02.738 --> 00:44:05.195
ORION: Yes!

00:44:05.195 --> 00:44:10.734
MATT: "Now, I am quite disturbed by the events of
these past 14 hours, and I would like to hear an

00:44:10.734 --> 00:44:17.289
"explanation. Arbiter, if you could please, prepare
the space." Arbiter Brom steps forward and

00:44:17.289 --> 00:44:22.196
pulls forth from underneath his robes a necklace
that contains a holy symbol. The same symbol you

00:44:22.196 --> 00:44:30.343
saw across the temple beneath the Slayer's Take,
an eye-like inscription of the god Ioun. Brom

00:44:30.343 --> 00:44:37.139
grasps it, looks about you all, and prepares this
slight hand gesture, and you feel a slight tingle

00:44:37.139 --> 00:44:39.460
across the skin that lasts a few seconds.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.773
MARISHA: Can I recognize the spell he's casting?

00:44:41.773 --> 00:44:44.864
MATT: I'll say go ahead and make a-- this would be
a religion check.

00:44:44.864 --> 00:44:52.918
MARISHA: He's doing a cleric thing, yeah? Seven.

00:44:52.918 --> 00:45:00.544
MATT: All right. Unable to ascertain the nature.
However, the incantation completes. No seeming

00:45:00.544 --> 00:45:07.999
noticeable effect. Brom nods and steps back in the
line of the thrones. I want all of you guys to

00:45:07.999 --> 00:45:10.538
roll charisma saving throws.

00:45:10.538 --> 00:45:15.095
MARISHA: Son of a bitch. Always a problem.

00:45:15.095 --> 00:45:21.747
ORION: 19.

00:45:21.747 --> 00:45:23.309
MARISHA: 11.

00:45:23.309 --> 00:45:29.215
SAM: I get advantage, and I rolled a 27.

00:45:29.215 --> 00:45:31.772
MATT: (laughs) Okay. Bards.

00:45:31.772 --> 00:45:33.132
LIAM: 19.

00:45:33.132 --> 00:45:34.640
LAURA: 13.

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:35.965
TRAVIS: 18.

00:45:35.965 --> 00:45:45.212
MATT: All right. Good to know. Uriel then looks to
the rest of you. "So. I've said my piece for the

00:45:45.212 --> 00:45:47.795
"moment. Explain."

00:45:47.795 --> 00:45:49.720
LIAM: I step forward.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:57.859
MARISHA: Can I do a quick insight check on Asum to
see if I can still recognize if he's still

00:45:57.859 --> 00:46:01.134
affected by the mind-control thing?

00:46:01.134 --> 00:46:04.562
MATT: Go ahead and make an insight check, sure.

00:46:04.562 --> 00:46:09.989
MARISHA: Ooh yeah! 28.

00:46:09.989 --> 00:46:18.159
MATT: Glancing at Asum, the way he's looking at
you and the general tension and feeling of the

00:46:18.159 --> 00:46:28.617
room, you gather that Asum is not his normal self
completely. You step forward.

00:46:28.617 --> 00:46:37.532
LIAM: Uriel. With all respect, I needn't remind
you what the group of people before you put

00:46:37.532 --> 00:46:43.499
themselves through on your behalf and your
family's behalf. We almost lost one of our own.

00:46:43.499 --> 00:46:50.474
And if that counts for nothing here, then nothing
makes sense. But if that is not enough, let us

00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:53.251
start here.

00:46:53.251 --> 00:47:01.481
ORION: The Briarwoods are vampires. And that old
lady, who was a butthole by the way, was with this

00:47:01.481 --> 00:47:04.362
demonoid person who we had to fight as well.

00:47:04.362 --> 00:47:13.095
LIAM: One thing at a time. That's true, but one
thing at a time. We had prior knowledge of the

00:47:13.095 --> 00:47:20.544
Briarwoods' intentions before this evening. And I
myself went to spy on them.

00:47:20.544 --> 00:47:28.591
LAURA: Here's the thing. Percy doesn't like them
because they killed his family. They took over his

00:47:28.591 --> 00:47:38.555
home, after killing his family. He got away. He
knows they're scary. We're trying to protect you.

00:47:38.555 --> 00:47:43.554
ORION: So the point is, we all know how dangerous
it is that the knowledge of vampire existence and

00:47:43.554 --> 00:47:50.201
the spreading of those vile creatures. And now we
know they do exist. So however the means that that

00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:54.884
came about is neither here nor there. We know
where they are.

00:47:54.884 --> 00:48:00.346
TRAVIS: And if you're wondering how we know
they're vampires-- (whispering) Vax, this is your

00:48:00.346 --> 00:48:01.446
cue.

00:48:01.446 --> 00:48:12.571
LIAM: I will subject myself to any test, to any
wizard or mage in this city who you know can

00:48:12.571 --> 00:48:18.659
ascertain the truth. To look through my eyes, to
see my memories. I don't know shit about magic,

00:48:18.659 --> 00:48:20.444
but there are people who do.

00:48:20.444 --> 00:48:28.723
SAM: Cleric Tristan also treated him last night
for his vampire-inflicted wound. I know this all

00:48:28.723 --> 00:48:34.106
looks really bad on the surface, and we did not
want to cause any disturbance within these

00:48:34.106 --> 00:48:42.549
hallowed walls, but there was a danger, we acted.
Perhaps too abruptly and without telling you.

00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:47.960
LAURA: We tried to get your attention. I called
for you immediately. As soon as we knew there was

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.255
danger.

00:48:49.255 --> 00:48:53.056
LIAM: And don't take our word for it. Anyone, have
them look in here.

00:48:53.056 --> 00:48:55.533
ORION: Actually, you take a Stormwind's word for--

00:48:55.533 --> 00:49:09.081
MATT: "Silence! Silence. You're in my court now,
Stormwind. You put so much weight upon this trust,

00:49:09.081 --> 00:49:14.598
"and you have done a good service. But also I've
heard whispers that you've thrown this trust

00:49:14.598 --> 00:49:20.841
"around in many circles. Remember, we held a parade
in your honor; we spread the word of the good

00:49:20.841 --> 00:49:26.918
"deeds you've done. We, at our own costs of Emon,
built you a keep, a home, at great expense, to

00:49:26.918 --> 00:49:35.526
"show thanks. And also, I believed, upon allowing
you to join the council, put us square. I owe you

00:49:35.526 --> 00:49:38.444
"nothing. Just as you owe me nothing."

00:49:38.444 --> 00:49:40.369
LIAM: Do you not want the truth?

00:49:40.369 --> 00:49:46.159
MATT: "I want the truth, but I also want you to
understand the stakes that are here and why there

00:49:46.159 --> 00:49:54.277
"is this question. As the leader of this-- not this
city, but this entire countryside, I have to be

00:49:54.277 --> 00:50:01.728
"sure, and this is not the first time I have been
lied to by very close, trusted people, so I have

00:50:01.728 --> 00:50:03.138
"to be thorough."

00:50:03.138 --> 00:50:10.890
LIAM: This is why I offer myself completely into
your control and put myself under your supervision

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:17.531
and any user of the arcane arts you want to 
peer inside my mind, let them step up to the

00:50:17.531 --> 00:50:19.812
plate, because I have nothing to hide.

00:50:19.812 --> 00:50:26.157
LAURA: Also, while you are inquiring about him,
you might inquire about Seeker Asum.

00:50:26.157 --> 00:50:30.500
SAM: If you're worried about lies within your own
ranks, I think you should start with him.

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:36.681
MARISHA: In fact, I actually might be able to help
Seeker Asum, if you will allow me to.

00:50:36.681 --> 00:50:38.180
SAM: Help him?

00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:42.113
MATT: You glance over at Asum, and Asum gives a
look to Uriel and Uriel--

00:50:42.113 --> 00:50:45.238
LAURA: He was mind-controlled last night.

00:50:45.238 --> 00:50:54.756
MATT: "I have had Asum at my side for the better
part of 15 years. He is responsible, far more than

00:50:54.756 --> 00:51:01.586
"your merry band has ever attempted, for keeping
and maintaining the good and lawful state of this

00:51:01.586 --> 00:51:02.490
"country."

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:15.003
LIAM: Uriel, your own family was not themselves!
And you know that! Look into my mind! Now! Today!

00:51:15.003 --> 00:51:17.733
You don't need to guess anything.

00:51:17.733 --> 00:51:32.422
MATT: "It would also do you well to show respect.
We are speaking, half-elf. Now, I would assign

00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:40.940
"Allura to such an endeavor. However, it has also
been noticed that she has grown quite friendly and

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:49.702
"attached to your group, and in this circumstance,
there is question. So you will be, in a few days,

00:51:49.702 --> 00:51:53.499
"assigned an individual to this ritual of which you
are presenting yourself."

00:51:53.499 --> 00:51:55.616
MARISHA: Uriel, please--

00:51:55.616 --> 00:52:07.981
MATT: "Shh. The Briarwoods, regardless of what
you may think they may be, or we do-- that will

00:52:07.981 --> 00:52:15.974
"show in time-- have shown nothing over the past
five years but graciousness, and gone through all

00:52:15.974 --> 00:52:21.696
"proper channels to establish this relationship
between our city and theirs. Far more than the

00:52:21.696 --> 00:52:24.320
"previous family ever attempted."

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:32.432
LIAM: Well, one may smile and smile and still be a
villain.

00:52:32.432 --> 00:52:38.961
MATT: "That goes both ways. Now, please."

00:52:38.961 --> 00:52:49.964
MARISHA: Just let me do a quick restoration spell
on Asum. If nothing is wrong with him, nothing

00:52:49.964 --> 00:52:59.705
will happen. It's harmless. It's like taking
medicine when you're not sick. It can't hurt. And

00:52:59.705 --> 00:53:10.395
if I am wrong, then we can continue on. We can
have Vax tested. Please, it'll take ten minutes.

00:53:10.395 --> 00:53:12.029
What can it hurt?

00:53:12.029 --> 00:53:16.229
LAURA: Up until last night, he was himself. Trust
us that now he is not.

00:53:16.229 --> 00:53:17.757
MARISHA: He came to us.

00:53:17.757 --> 00:53:24.020
MATT: "There has been nothing about his behavior,
at all, to insinuate any change of anything of the

00:53:24.166 --> 00:53:32.725
"sort. And I have known the man for quite some
time, before I even took this throne. However, I

00:53:32.725 --> 00:53:39.480
"will, in the good graces and the relationship we
forged, allow this. Asum, are you all right with

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:40.347
"this?"

00:53:40.347 --> 00:53:46.054
Asum gives a nod. "Well, if this is to be how it
is. Certainly." And he steps forward. The halfling

00:53:46.054 --> 00:53:51.678
approaches you, looking you in the face. All
right. You would like to attempt your Greater

00:53:51.678 --> 00:53:53.279
Restoration spell?

00:53:53.279 --> 00:53:57.879
MARISHA: First, I meditate for a second, and I
cast Enhance Ability on myself.

00:53:57.879 --> 00:54:02.861
MATT: As a note, as you begin casting, you notice
the guards all go for their weapons and ready

00:54:02.861 --> 00:54:08.407
themselves, uncertain of what's about to
transpire. There is a tension in the room based on

00:54:08.407 --> 00:54:11.671
what this is going to be.

00:54:11.671 --> 00:54:15.812
MARISHA: Can I get some meditation music,
Scanlan?

00:54:15.812 --> 00:54:32.894
SAM: Oh! (chanting)

00:54:32.894 --> 00:54:35.195
MATT: All right. So first you cast Enhance Ability
on yourself.

00:54:35.195 --> 00:54:37.582
MARISHA: Am I maybe inspired by that?

00:54:37.582 --> 00:54:46.398
MATT: Sure. In the tension of the room, this slow
droning hum of the gnome, which you can notice

00:54:46.398 --> 00:54:53.230
some of the guards look at each other, confused.
And Asum puts his hand up like, hold off.

00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:55.809
LIAM: It's Tuvan throat singing.

00:54:55.809 --> 00:55:02.760
MATT: All right. So first you cast Enhance
Ability on your--

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.252
MARISHA: Self.

00:55:04.252 --> 00:55:06.177
SAM: What ability?

00:55:06.177 --> 00:55:16.949
MARISHA: To enhance wisdom? Wisdom.

00:55:16.949 --> 00:55:26.715
MATT: Okay. You reach out with Greater
Restoration. You complete the ritual. You touch

00:55:26.715 --> 00:55:35.836
onto the arms of Asum. It fades, and you see in
his eyes there's a moment of clarity and an

00:55:35.836 --> 00:55:45.260
inhale. A slight gasp, like some realization hits
him and his expression changes and looks towards

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:53.562
you and just goes-- He puts his hands out like
this for a moment, just trying to almost tell you

00:55:53.562 --> 00:55:58.539
something. Go ahead and make a wisdom check. Just
a d20. Or no, make an insight. Make a straight

00:55:58.539 --> 00:56:00.961
insight. This is more of an insight roll here.

00:56:00.961 --> 00:56:04.700
MARISHA: Okay. Oh! 29.

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:10.761
MATT: You get the sense through the subtlety of
physical motion and expression, Asum is telling

00:56:10.761 --> 00:56:21.343
you, just go with me on this. He steps back into
the place next to the throne. There's a brief

00:56:21.343 --> 00:56:26.740
moment of pause. Uriel says, "And, Asum?"

00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:32.944
Asum goes, "My stance has not changed. I know not
what she is attempting or thought the situation

00:56:32.944 --> 00:56:38.751
"was, but it appears to me that this was either
misinformation or at least at the time being,

00:56:38.751 --> 00:56:43.455
"hopefully, not a lie. But I believe Brom has taken
care of that, yes?"

00:56:43.455 --> 00:56:46.897
And Brom gives a nod. "I certainly have hoped
to."

00:56:46.897 --> 00:57:03.253
Uriel goes, "Hm. All right. Here's the
circumstance: as it stands, I fear I must revoke

00:57:03.253 --> 00:57:10.201
"Vox Machina's membership in the council of
Tal'Dorei until further notice, for the safety of

00:57:10.201 --> 00:57:19.291
"our countryside and the current tension in our
relationship."

00:57:19.291 --> 00:57:27.057
SAM: Objection! That's it. I just wanted to say
that. Please continue. I just want it noted that

00:57:27.057 --> 00:57:29.524
we object strongly to this.

00:57:29.524 --> 00:57:37.267
MATT: "I understand. And this will only continue
until all of our investigations are complete."

00:57:37.267 --> 00:57:45.093
SAM: Are we still allowed free rein to roam about
as we please? Are we under arrest for anything?

00:57:45.093 --> 00:57:50.529
MATT: "You are not under arrest. You are revoked
from the council, and you will be closely watched

00:57:50.529 --> 00:57:53.232
"until our investigations are complete."

00:57:53.232 --> 00:57:56.530
LAURA: How long will your investigations take?

00:57:56.530 --> 00:58:03.528
MATT: He looks back to Asum and Asum says, "Well,
depends on how quickly we can acquire the

00:58:03.528 --> 00:58:08.686
"information; it could be weeks. I'll do my best to
make it thorough and quick."

00:58:08.686 --> 00:58:11.135
LAURA: Are we allowed to leave the city in that
time?

00:58:11.135 --> 00:58:17.695
MATT: Uriel looks back and says, "You may leave if
you wish. Know that there have been precautions

00:58:17.695 --> 00:58:22.494
"taken. Should you attempt to flee, we will find
you."

00:58:22.494 --> 00:58:24.863
LIAM: And when are you to look into my mind?

00:58:24.863 --> 00:58:27.956
LAURA: Weirdo!

00:58:27.956 --> 00:58:31.651
(laughter)

00:58:31.651 --> 00:58:33.578
LIAM: It freaking ends here. Right away.

00:58:33.578 --> 00:58:35.394
TRAVIS: Can you read my mind?

00:58:35.394 --> 00:58:36.999
LIAM: There is no spoon.

00:58:36.999 --> 00:58:44.525
MATT: "We ought to speak to the Lyceum to find a
proper individual of sufficient power and trust to

00:58:44.525 --> 00:58:50.297
"do this, as Allura right now is being kept out of
the scenario."

00:58:50.297 --> 00:58:54.359
SAM: Are we allowed to speak with Allura?

00:58:54.359 --> 00:59:01.805
MATT: "If you wish. Outside of these chambers. Do
what you must to clear your name. I would like

00:59:01.805 --> 00:59:10.646
"very much for this all to be true, what you're
saying. But do not flee. Do not give an

00:59:10.646 --> 00:59:14.789
"inclination that you attempt to escape this
judgment, for we will take that as a sign of

00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:16.186
"guilt."

00:59:16.186 --> 00:59:18.857
LIAM: We've no intention of going anywhere.

00:59:18.857 --> 00:59:23.370
MATT: "Should we conclude that your actions were
beyond reason and the moral fiber of this council

00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:29.922
"before your return, we will have no choice to put
a bounty on your heads, should you not return. I

00:59:29.922 --> 00:59:36.649
"really, really do not wish to do this. Do not make
me do this."

00:59:36.649 --> 00:59:40.617
ORION: I stand up. "No need for threats, friend.
Are we done here?"

00:59:40.617 --> 00:59:48.101
MATT: "I want to believe you all. I ask you, show
that my trust has not been misplaced all this

00:59:48.101 --> 00:59:51.723
"time. Now, you may leave."

00:59:51.723 --> 00:59:56.294
SAM: I look forward to the second parade you'll
throw for us after our names are cleared.

00:59:56.294 --> 00:59:58.993
MATT: "Very well."

00:59:58.993 --> 01:00:05.513
TRAVIS: I turn to the guards that were grabbing at
their weapons and I flex real fast at them and

01:00:05.513 --> 01:00:06.502
then I walk.

01:00:06.502 --> 01:00:08.083
MATT: Four of them go, (yelps).

01:00:08.083 --> 01:00:09.034
TRAVIS: Bitch!

01:00:09.034 --> 01:00:12.104
(laughter)

01:00:12.104 --> 01:00:19.502
MATT: As you guys go back out the doors that you
entered, the guards now a little closely following

01:00:19.502 --> 01:00:26.021
as you exit, leading you out of the palace, down
the front steps, and essentially stand at the

01:00:26.021 --> 01:00:27.634
front of the palace gates.

01:00:27.634 --> 01:00:32.683
LIAM: I'm sorry. I was just talking to one of your
friends. Have you seen a belt that is shaped like

01:00:32.683 --> 01:00:37.669
a snake? Sometimes it moves around on its own. And
it answers to the name Simon, but usually it's

01:00:37.669 --> 01:00:43.071
just a belt and looks really cool. Have you seen
it? Is there a lost and found I can check out?

01:00:43.071 --> 01:00:44.813
It's very dear to me.

01:00:44.813 --> 01:00:49.819
MATT: The guard just looks for a second and goes,
"I think you've got more important matters to deal

01:00:49.819 --> 01:00:52.466
"with before you go looking for a belt, sir."

01:00:52.466 --> 01:00:57.658
LIAM: Where's that other guy? He was more
receptive to this. Do I see that other guy?

01:00:57.658 --> 01:01:00.751
LAURA: Darling. Seriously.

01:01:00.751 --> 01:01:04.022
MATT: The guards all turn around and start
ascending the stairs.

01:01:04.022 --> 01:01:08.159
LIAM: It's on all the fan art. It really makes
sense to have it on me.

01:01:08.159 --> 01:01:10.516
MATT: They don't appear to be listening.

01:01:10.516 --> 01:01:16.918
LIAM: Keep an eye out for it. 100 gold to any chap
who finds it and holds onto it for me.

01:01:16.918 --> 01:01:22.219
MATT: Two of them stop in their step for a second
and then keep walking.

01:01:22.219 --> 01:01:23.604
LIAM: I'm a nice guy!

01:01:23.604 --> 01:01:25.501
(laughter)

01:01:25.501 --> 01:01:27.204
MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion roll.

01:01:27.204 --> 01:01:29.387
TRAVIS: You're going to get six belts thrown at
you.

01:01:29.387 --> 01:01:31.118
LIAM: That's terrible. Six.

01:01:31.118 --> 01:01:36.530
MATT: It was a brief pause. But also. A brief
pause.

01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:40.615
LAURA: You have a two in persuasion? Oh wow.

01:01:40.615 --> 01:01:44.383
SAM: We'll break in tonight and find it.

01:01:44.383 --> 01:01:46.329
TRAVIS: Could we wait outside for Allura?

01:01:46.329 --> 01:01:48.161
LIAM: I'll risk it all.

01:01:48.161 --> 01:01:56.104
MATT: All right. So you are now currently there in
the cobblestone street of the Cloudtop District,

01:01:56.104 --> 01:02:02.052
removed from the Council of Tal'Dorei and left in
this interesting circumstance.

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:04.469
SAM: Keyleth, what happened? Your magic didn't
work?

01:02:04.469 --> 01:02:06.189
MARISHA: No, it worked.

01:02:06.189 --> 01:02:07.490
LAURA: What happened?

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.395
SAM: But Asum lied.

01:02:10.395 --> 01:02:12.328
ORION: He gave her a magic winky face.

01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:14.811
MARISHA: Yeah, essentially. Yeah. He gave me like
a--

01:02:14.811 --> 01:02:20.697
LAURA: What does that mean? Does that mean Uriel's
under their control? I don't understand.

01:02:20.697 --> 01:02:22.978
LIAM: Is he playing some sort of long game here?

01:02:22.978 --> 01:02:28.272
SAM: It must mean that we have something to fear
from Uriel. Or someone else close.

01:02:28.272 --> 01:02:32.493
MARISHA: I don't know who to trust anymore, to be
totally honest.

01:02:32.493 --> 01:02:33.811
TRAVIS: Really?

01:02:33.811 --> 01:02:43.636
MARISHA: It worked. I could feel it break. It
worked, and he's got some sort of long game. I

01:02:43.636 --> 01:02:49.560
don't know if it's because he doesn't want Uriel
to know, for whatever reason. I don't know if it's

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.178
because he has some deeper, ulterior motive.

01:02:52.178 --> 01:02:55.467
LAURA: Do you think he was faking that he was
healed, and maybe he wasn't?

01:02:55.467 --> 01:02:58.599
TRAVIS: Or maybe we have to bring proof of their
vampirism back?

01:02:58.599 --> 01:02:59.627
MARISHA: No.

01:02:59.627 --> 01:03:00.969
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:03:00.969 --> 01:03:07.577
MARISHA: Wait. No to Vex. What was your question?

01:03:07.577 --> 01:03:10.812
TRAVIS: To bring back proof of them being
vampires.

01:03:10.812 --> 01:03:17.686
SAM: Proof would help. Hey! Don't we have a
prisoner? Can't we question the prisoner?

01:03:17.686 --> 01:03:20.738
LAURA: Is he bleeding out? What if he's dead?
We're so screwed!

01:03:20.738 --> 01:03:22.673
MARISHA: I made sure.

01:03:22.673 --> 01:03:27.119
LAURA: Yeah, the guy that Percy shot the hand off
of.

01:03:27.119 --> 01:03:29.173
MARISHA: I cauterized his wounds, remember?

01:03:29.173 --> 01:03:31.541
SAM: We should question him. He could have proof.

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:35.457
LAURA: Oh shit! I hope everything's okay.

01:03:35.457 --> 01:03:47.702
ORION: Wait a minute! I really need to go to
Allura. She's our best interest right now.

01:03:47.702 --> 01:03:51.521
SAM: We get it! You want her body. Now's not the
time.

01:03:51.521 --> 01:03:55.894
ORION: It is beyond that. There are several
reasons to go. We need to get the Earring of

01:03:55.894 --> 01:04:05.698
Telescription. I need her to enchant something for
me, too. As well as the fact I fear that our keep

01:04:05.698 --> 01:04:10.033
may be in danger. I would like to ask her if she
may be able to set up a warding spell for--

01:04:10.033 --> 01:04:16.328
LAURA: Can you go get her and bring her to the
keep? I need to find out if this boy is all

01:04:16.328 --> 01:04:17.339
right.

01:04:17.339 --> 01:04:20.320
MARISHA: Well, we can split up. I can go with
you.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:27.014
MATT: As you guys are having this discussion, the
palace doors open and you hear the quick footsteps

01:04:27.014 --> 01:04:30.975
of Allura, rushing from the palace now, running
towards you guys.

01:04:30.975 --> 01:04:33.044
LAURA: Saving the day. Again.

01:04:33.044 --> 01:04:35.052
MARISHA: Wait, she's coming out of the palace?

01:04:35.052 --> 01:04:37.547
MATT: She's coming out of the palace, behind you
guys. Like after the council had just closed. The

01:04:37.547 --> 01:04:41.852
meeting had finished. She basically gave chase to
you guys and is now catching up to you on the

01:04:41.852 --> 01:04:42.711
street.

01:04:42.711 --> 01:04:44.793
SAM: What the shit happened in there?

01:04:44.793 --> 01:04:46.929
MARISHA: We were just talking about you!

01:04:46.929 --> 01:05:01.525
MATT: "Everyone-- I don't fully know what happened
last night, and--" She looks to you, Tiberius, and

01:05:01.525 --> 01:05:07.775
says, "You didn't, did you? Please tell me you did
not kill that woman."

01:05:07.775 --> 01:05:09.295
ORION: Oh, I absolutely did!

01:05:09.295 --> 01:05:12.356
LAURA: But she was attacking us.

01:05:12.356 --> 01:05:15.305
SAM: It looks bad, but she was a threat.

01:05:15.305 --> 01:05:23.555
ORION: Her and another one with this-- what was
he, a tiefling? Named the Broker attacked us. And

01:05:23.555 --> 01:05:25.088
that's why I killed her.

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:35.019
MATT: "Brom's divination is very clear. And he
divined that the woman was currently filled with

01:05:35.019 --> 01:05:40.956
"fear, attempting to flee, and unconscious when she
was murdered."

01:05:40.956 --> 01:05:43.652
LIAM: How did she flee when she was unconscious?

01:05:43.652 --> 01:05:47.522
TRAVIS: She fled, went unconscious, then we
butchered her.

01:05:47.522 --> 01:05:51.495
MARISHA: Just accept it for what it is, guys.

01:05:51.495 --> 01:05:59.001
MATT: "I just worry. I know not what happened
here, and I heard what you said, and I honestly do

01:05:59.001 --> 01:06:05.271
"not trust the Briarwoods myself either. There was
something about that meal and the conversation,

01:06:05.271 --> 01:06:10.280
"and their presence that put me off entirely. It
was strange. And what you say makes a lot of

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:20.566
"sense. Vampirism is a bit beyond what I was
expecting. I did sense some powerful masqueraded

01:06:20.566 --> 01:06:32.440
"arcane essence from Lady Briarwood. Look, I would
recommend for this to do your best to be thorough

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:37.781
"in this. Bring back any and all information you
can. From the words I hear, you probably have at

01:06:37.781 --> 01:06:44.173
"best a few weeks before this comes to a close. And
if you don't have enough evidence to support your

01:06:44.173 --> 01:06:48.399
"argument-- well, I don't know."

01:06:48.399 --> 01:06:54.979
LIAM: Allura, all I know how to do is break locks,
but I've seen these people do things with magic

01:06:54.979 --> 01:07:01.390
that have defied expectations. Why can no one look
into my memory? You have looked across miles.

01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:04.751
Cannot anyone look into my mind and see?

01:07:04.751 --> 01:07:06.918
LAURA: They're going to do it!

01:07:06.918 --> 01:07:10.988
SAM: Yes, but that might not be proof enough for
them. Someone could have corrupted your mind.

01:07:10.988 --> 01:07:16.471
MATT: "You have to understand. Not all arcane
works that way. There are magics that can dabble

01:07:16.471 --> 01:07:21.148
"in that realm, but none that specialize that here
in Emon. Divination, yes there are elements of

01:07:21.148 --> 01:07:29.505
"that. We can see the physical. We can see certain
events. But to look into one's mind is a different

01:07:29.505 --> 01:07:30.877
"magic entirely."

01:07:30.877 --> 01:07:34.350
LIAM: Are there no spells that can divine if
someone's speaking true?

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:41.537
MATT: "That was attempted during that council, but
after you left, Brom notified Uriel and the

01:07:41.537 --> 01:07:49.114
"Council that many of you were resistant to the
spell, and as such, it could not be verified."

01:07:49.114 --> 01:08:01.236
LAURA: (laughs) We should have rolled low! Just
tell us you're doing it, we won't resist it! What

01:08:01.236 --> 01:08:03.459
the shit? Doesn't even trust us to tell the
truth.

01:08:03.459 --> 01:08:05.613
TRAVIS: If we came back with proof?

01:08:05.613 --> 01:08:08.931
SAM: What sort of proof do you think they would
accept? The head of Lady Briarwood?

01:08:08.931 --> 01:08:12.875
LAURA: No, because it'll disappear the minute we
kill her or something. They're vampires, I don't

01:08:12.875 --> 01:08:14.349
know what they do.

01:08:14.349 --> 01:08:19.923
MATT: She gives a thought to that. She goes,
"Interestingly enough, if an artifact or an item

01:08:19.923 --> 01:08:24.714
"brought forth from them could be divined, that
should tell all."

01:08:24.714 --> 01:08:28.964
MARISHA: Is there still the remaining wreckage of
their carriage? Is that still there?

01:08:28.964 --> 01:08:33.161
MATT: "The carriage has been disposed. It's been
picked over, and there were remnants within the

01:08:33.161 --> 01:08:40.766
"rubble of some sort of a 'siggle' of teleportation.
But that is no-- a sigil, if you will."

01:08:40.766 --> 01:08:44.406
(laughter)

01:08:44.406 --> 01:08:47.900
TRAVIS: What sort of artifact? Like, a brooch? A
handbag?

01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:50.219
LIAM: Are we talking about that motherfucker's
teeth?

01:08:50.219 --> 01:08:51.513
ORION: I need to see that sigil.

01:08:51.513 --> 01:09:02.154
MATT: "Sigil. We're all learning together. That, I
believe, has all been investigated and kept under

01:09:02.154 --> 01:09:10.914
"lock and key with Asum. You would have to speak
with him. I would like to help. I cannot come with

01:09:10.914 --> 01:09:19.288
"you. I'm working on something else at the moment.
Ah!" And she reaches into her pocket and brings

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:24.600
out your Earring of Transcription.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.187
ORION: Thank you so much, Lady Allura!

01:09:27.187 --> 01:09:34.637
MATT: As she hands it to you, she gives you a
really, really concerned look. And just gives it

01:09:34.637 --> 01:09:43.720
to you and hands it back. And it's a look of-- and
it hits you: it's a look of disappointment with a

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.133
hint of heartbreak.

01:09:45.133 --> 01:09:48.715
TRAVIS: Oh, that's the worst! I'm not angry, I'm
just disappointed. Ugh!

01:09:48.715 --> 01:09:50.722
LIAM: I feel like I've failed you.

01:09:50.722 --> 01:09:51.977
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:09:51.977 --> 01:09:58.174
MATT: She looks back to you as you take it and
goes, "Do your best to clear your name."

01:09:58.174 --> 01:09:59.718
ORION: I shall.

01:09:59.718 --> 01:10:03.947
MATT: "I know you come of noble blood, and many of
you stand to inspire many others of noble blood.

01:10:03.947 --> 01:10:10.291
"As celebrated heroes of this city, there is a lot
more on the line here besides just your

01:10:10.291 --> 01:10:20.386
"well-being. There's a lot of people in this town
that look up to you. Nevertheless, I've already

01:10:20.386 --> 01:10:23.968
"said more than I should. Good luck."

01:10:23.968 --> 01:10:26.572
LAURA: Thank you, Allura.

01:10:26.572 --> 01:10:32.700
MATT: She looks behind and you can see she takes
this small hood of the same material of her robe

01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:37.929
that she's wearing and puts it up over her head
and rushes off towards her white tower towards the

01:10:37.929 --> 01:10:39.736
edge of the Cloudtop District.

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:41.517
LIAM: Fucking politics.

01:10:41.517 --> 01:10:43.487
SAM: No one insight checked her.

01:10:43.487 --> 01:10:49.038
TRAVIS: She's telling the truth. Let's go make
sure the prisoner isn't dead.

01:10:49.038 --> 01:10:54.158
SAM: All right. So wait. What are our avenues?
We're going to have to Columbo this. What are our

01:10:54.158 --> 01:10:55.811
avenues of finding proof?

01:10:55.811 --> 01:10:58.096
LAURA: We say as we're walking back to the keep.

01:10:58.096 --> 01:11:03.654
SAM: We have a prisoner we can question. Who knows
if that will yield anything. And then, we might

01:11:03.654 --> 01:11:08.745
have to go gather evidence, which means leaving
town against his word.

01:11:08.745 --> 01:11:10.090
LAURA: Well, we're allowed to leave town.

01:11:10.090 --> 01:11:11.506
LIAM and SAM: No!

01:11:11.506 --> 01:11:15.184
LAURA: Yeah! No! He said we're allowed to leave.
We just can't look like we're fleeing, so we tell

01:11:15.184 --> 01:11:18.447
them where we're going. They can even fucking
follow us. I don't care.

01:11:18.447 --> 01:11:24.716
LIAM: So we tell them that we're going to their
political-- the people that they're trying to

01:11:24.716 --> 01:11:30.240
create a political relationship with? We're just
going off to invade your political allies.

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:36.018
TRAVIS: Oh come on! You half-elves. I swear to
god! Have you never heard of lying before? Yeah!

01:11:36.018 --> 01:11:40.378
We don't tell them where we're going. We're going
on a field trip. We're going to pick berries. Fuck

01:11:40.378 --> 01:11:42.166
all, but we go there.

01:11:42.166 --> 01:11:44.985
ORION: The only way we can go there is telling
them.

01:11:44.985 --> 01:11:47.191
TRAVIS: What? And we're going there, what for?

01:11:47.191 --> 01:11:51.833
ORION: When I talk to Asum and get that sigil to
that damn Briarwood keep. That's how we get

01:11:51.833 --> 01:11:52.765
there.

01:11:52.765 --> 01:11:55.660
TRAVIS: Why don't we say we're taking a picnic--
oh, we took a wrong turn. Hey, it's the

01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:56.716
Briarwoods!

01:11:56.716 --> 01:12:01.334
ORION: We don't have to lie to them. We tell them
where we're going, and we can just go there.

01:12:01.334 --> 01:12:03.283
TRAVIS: We don't have to if we don't want to.

01:12:03.283 --> 01:12:04.739
LIAM: You're pretty.

01:12:04.739 --> 01:12:07.750
LAURA: Especially that beardy side, Grog.

01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:10.254
TRAVIS: It's a full beard right now.

01:12:10.254 --> 01:12:18.616
MATT: What you do know is the sigil that a
teleportation circle is attached to is known when

01:12:18.616 --> 01:12:25.351
you cast or create the circle. The circle does not
necessarily indicate or maintain the sigil it's

01:12:25.351 --> 01:12:26.534
attached to.

01:12:26.534 --> 01:12:27.802
ORION: It's just a piece of it?

01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:31.974
MATT: Meaning, there are two parts to it. There
is the sigil that it sends to, and there is the

01:12:31.974 --> 01:12:39.286
actual ritual circle that is created. The circle
that attaches to it is not the same as the

01:12:39.286 --> 01:12:46.205
destination. There are elements of it that connect
it, but you would not be able to ascertain a sigil

01:12:46.205 --> 01:12:50.444
to Whitestone immediately from looking at the
initial circle.

01:12:50.444 --> 01:12:53.780
LIAM: Thanks for the cups, guys! The cup.

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:56.494
TRAVIS: I just noticed that!

01:12:56.494 --> 01:13:02.894
LIAM: Well, let's go check on this poor little
shit in the dungeon.

01:13:02.894 --> 01:13:06.846
SAM: And then the next step will be to seek out
Seeker Asum?

01:13:06.846 --> 01:13:11.243
ORION: I'd like to stop by the temple real quick
to pick up my decanter.

01:13:11.243 --> 01:13:13.491
SAM: How many errands do you have to run?

01:13:13.491 --> 01:13:15.128
LAURA: Endless errands.

01:13:15.128 --> 01:13:20.253
SAM: All right. Go run your errands! We've got a
mystery to solve.

01:13:20.253 --> 01:13:23.424
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want to be there when we talk to
the prisoner, too.

01:13:23.424 --> 01:13:29.421
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way back to
Greyskull Keep. Are you going with them or

01:13:29.421 --> 01:13:30.285
you're--

01:13:30.285 --> 01:13:31.860
ORION: I'm doing all the shit.

01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:33.118
MATT: What are you doing?

01:13:33.118 --> 01:13:34.312
SAM: He's got a list.

01:13:34.312 --> 01:13:35.921
MATT: I would like to know the list.

01:13:35.921 --> 01:13:41.970
ORION: I'm going to stop at an armory because I
want my crossbow reinforced. I don't know what

01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:48.567
that means. I want to learn a different sigil. The
one that I researched for the waste fair, or for

01:13:48.567 --> 01:13:55.713
the way-- the Feywild! There's this big city next
to it that I researched, that is near it, and in

01:13:55.713 --> 01:14:03.743
that city might be a sigil. So I'm going to go see
if I can learn it. And then I want to come back

01:14:03.743 --> 01:14:05.872
and start enchanting my blades.

01:14:05.872 --> 01:14:07.532
SAM: It's a busy day.

01:14:07.532 --> 01:14:08.790
MATT: Okay.

01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:11.164
ORION: I can give it to you. I wrote it down.

01:14:11.164 --> 01:14:18.400
SAM: Coming soon on Friday nights: The Adventures
of Tiberius's Errands! 7:00 to 10:00 every Friday

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.776
night on Twitch.

01:14:19.776 --> 01:14:22.911
ORION: And then I have to go to the dry cleaners
for my robe.

01:14:22.911 --> 01:14:29.196
MATT: All right. So as you begin that process, the
rest of you continue back to the Keep. As you

01:14:29.196 --> 01:14:36.236
approach Greyskull Keep, there are two individuals
waiting for you at the gate that you do not

01:14:36.236 --> 01:14:39.661
recognize from a distance.

01:14:39.661 --> 01:14:41.529
SAM: Wait, what? Say that again.

01:14:41.529 --> 01:14:44.901
MATT: There's two individuals waiting for you at
the gate. You can see at a distance, but you don't

01:14:44.901 --> 01:14:45.946
recognize.

01:14:45.946 --> 01:14:47.739
SAM: They're our handlers, probably.

01:14:47.739 --> 01:14:49.958
LIAM: Grog, come on. Let's go have a talk with
someone.

01:14:49.958 --> 01:14:51.574
LAURA: I walk with you.

01:14:51.574 --> 01:14:53.443
SAM: We're all going!

01:14:53.443 --> 01:14:55.623
LIAM: Let's go arm in arm in one big line!

01:14:55.623 --> 01:14:58.835
LAURA: Well, they're right at our fucking keep.
It's not like we're all headed in the same

01:14:58.835 --> 01:15:00.178
direction, anyway.

01:15:00.178 --> 01:15:01.930
ORION: Who doesn't have a ring?

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:03.355
SAM: A ring of what?

01:15:03.355 --> 01:15:04.501
ORION: An earring.

01:15:04.501 --> 01:15:05.929
MARISHA: I have one right now.

01:15:05.929 --> 01:15:07.034
SAM: I think I do?

01:15:07.034 --> 01:15:08.005
LAURA: I have one.

01:15:08.005 --> 01:15:08.955
LIAM: I have one.

01:15:08.955 --> 01:15:10.443
LAURA: Grog doesn't have one.

01:15:10.443 --> 01:15:12.846
TRAVIS: How far away from the keep are we?

01:15:12.846 --> 01:15:17.548
MATT: You're probably a good 100 to 150 feet.

01:15:17.548 --> 01:15:24.569
TRAVIS: I whistle really loud and say, who are
these fucks in front of the keep? to the guard

01:15:24.569 --> 01:15:26.484
that we have employed.

01:15:26.484 --> 01:15:36.782
MATT: Okay. So. Let me try and see who's on duty
right now.

01:15:36.782 --> 01:15:42.664
LAURA: He has notes on who is on duty.

01:15:42.664 --> 01:15:51.445
MATT: This would still be Shayne and Cordell.
Cordell shouts down from the top of the wall and

01:15:51.445 --> 01:15:54.825
says, "I don't think they're a threat."

01:15:54.825 --> 01:15:58.584
TRAVIS: Right. We'll be the judge of that. As you
were.

01:15:58.584 --> 01:16:01.474
SAM: Grog, keep in mind, these are our allies.

01:16:01.474 --> 01:16:03.455
LAURA: Hello!

01:16:03.455 --> 01:16:09.413
MATT: As you walk up and you get close, you get a
better view. You're expecting ominous, armored

01:16:09.413 --> 01:16:14.896
guards. Somebody possibly assigned to escort you.
Instead, you're greeted by what looks to be an

01:16:14.896 --> 01:16:20.347
older couple waiting at the gate. A man and a
woman, dressed in simple clothes, weathered skin.

01:16:20.347 --> 01:16:23.872
And as you go out to them, they both smile.

01:16:23.872 --> 01:16:27.089
SAM: We hate old people.

01:16:27.089 --> 01:16:29.040
(laughter)

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:30.771
LAURA: Who are you?

01:16:30.771 --> 01:16:32.315
TRAVIS: Favored enemy!

01:16:32.315 --> 01:16:39.088
MATT: They begin walking up, and the man steps
forward. You can see he's got small dirty glasses

01:16:39.088 --> 01:16:45.739
at the end of his nose and says, "Hello, hello!
Good afternoon, everyone! I'm sorry to be a

01:16:45.739 --> 01:16:53.126
"bother. But unless my eyes and tales do deceive
me, might you all be the heroes known as Vox

01:16:53.126 --> 01:16:54.323
"Machina?"

01:16:54.323 --> 01:16:59.219
LAURA: Can I insight check to see if these guys
are legit?

01:16:59.219 --> 01:17:00.871
SAM: Legit what? Old people?

01:17:00.871 --> 01:17:03.823
LAURA: It could be Lord and Lady Briarwood, for
all I know!

01:17:03.823 --> 01:17:10.043
LIAM: Me too. I did well. I rolled 18 on them.

01:17:10.043 --> 01:17:19.072
MATT: Okay. From what you can tell, they are both
happy, simple folk that are here with a tension of

01:17:19.072 --> 01:17:22.124
purpose, but nothing that seems to set off any
alarms.

01:17:22.124 --> 01:17:30.279
SAM: We are Vox Machina. I'm sure word of us has
spread far and wide. We're a pretty big deal. Why

01:17:30.279 --> 01:17:32.815
have you made this journey to us?

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:37.996
MATT: The woman, who's holding his side, lets go
of his arm and says, "We come to you humbly as

01:17:37.996 --> 01:17:41.904
"representatives of the farming community just
north of Emon's walls."

01:17:41.904 --> 01:17:43.704
MARISHA: Oh, I love farmers!

01:17:43.704 --> 01:17:48.917
MATT: "I am Riley Klaus and this is my husband,
Ben." "Pleasure to meet y'all."

01:17:48.917 --> 01:17:50.254
LAURA: Hi.

01:17:50.254 --> 01:17:55.728
MATT: "You see, many of us here, we make our
living through livestock and small crops." Ben

01:17:55.728 --> 01:18:02.079
takes over at this point and says, "Word is that
the Sovereign will be calling down troops from

01:18:02.079 --> 01:18:09.323
"Fort Daxio for a while, so the need for meats and
fresh produce has been elevated."

01:18:09.323 --> 01:18:15.518
The wife, Riley, then says, "Around this time,
over the past two weeks, a number of our finest

01:18:15.518 --> 01:18:24.386
"cows and sheep have gone missing. No struggle or
mess or signs of dire wolves. Nothing! We

01:18:24.386 --> 01:18:28.669
"suspected thieves, initially, but we sent up our
neighbor's boy Kyle to watch over them until

01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:37.903
"sunrise and he saw the culprit. From what he
described, a giant bird, larger than anything he's

01:18:37.903 --> 01:18:40.176
"ever seen or heard of."

01:18:40.176 --> 01:18:47.276
Ben then takes over the conversation, "Wings at
least ten carts long, tip to tip. Just swooped

01:18:47.276 --> 01:18:53.191
"down, he said, without sound and in one motion
snatched up one of our most virile bulls. Mr.

01:18:53.191 --> 01:18:55.386
"Simms, just gone like that!"

01:18:55.386 --> 01:18:56.868
MARISHA: Mr. Simms?

01:18:56.868 --> 01:18:58.565
MATT: "That was the bull."

01:18:58.565 --> 01:19:02.038
Riley says, "Kyle said he saw it fly northwest."

01:19:02.038 --> 01:19:09.658
MARISHA: Northwest? Can I do a nature check to see
if I can recognize the creature he's describing?

01:19:09.658 --> 01:19:12.477
LIAM: Are we certain he's not describing a
dragon?

01:19:12.477 --> 01:19:13.884
MARISHA: 26.

01:19:13.884 --> 01:19:22.099
MATT: 26. You've seen some big birds in your time.
This is, from what they're describing, a lot

01:19:22.099 --> 01:19:31.733
bigger than any birds you've encountered in your
experience. You've heard whispers of larger birds

01:19:31.733 --> 01:19:46.210
in the wild, but you've never seen anything like
that. You haven't had any personal experience

01:19:46.210 --> 01:19:48.384
hearing or seeing anything of this size.

01:19:48.384 --> 01:19:50.350
MARISHA: But it is a bird?

01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:52.722
MATT: That's what they described it as. At night.

01:19:52.722 --> 01:19:55.034
LAURA: When did these birds start showing up?

01:19:55.034 --> 01:20:02.308
MATT: "About two weeks ago when the whole thing
started to happen."

01:20:02.308 --> 01:20:08.273
And then Ben kicks in and says, "Should this keep
up, most of us will lose everything before the

01:20:08.273 --> 01:20:14.440
"year is out. Now, we've talked with the leaders of
the farming community this side of Emon. We've

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:16.073
"scrounged up what we could."

01:20:16.073 --> 01:20:26.039
And he brings up a couple of coin purses and she
goes, "512 gold pieces, 37 silver, and 103 copper.

01:20:26.039 --> 01:20:27.727
"That's all we can spare."

01:20:27.727 --> 01:20:30.888
LAURA: Keep your money.

01:20:30.888 --> 01:20:32.452
MARISHA: Yes, keep your money.

01:20:32.452 --> 01:20:34.520
MATT: "We can't possibly--"

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:40.560
LIAM: What about this? What if you supplied us
with a small stream of produce for our servants

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:46.453
here at the keep? For cooking, for feeding them,
for feeding us when we're here? It'll be a sight

01:20:46.453 --> 01:20:49.949
less than 500; it wouldn't be nothing. You could
still give us something.

01:20:49.949 --> 01:20:53.308
MATT: "Yes! We could, we'd be more than happy
to!"

01:20:53.308 --> 01:20:59.209
SAM: However, despite what my companion is saying,
we are not agreeing to go after this winged beast

01:20:59.209 --> 01:21:05.959
quite yet. We hear your plight, and we sympathize,
and we will do what we can, but we have very

01:21:05.959 --> 01:21:14.920
pressing matters right now. Is there a deadline of
some sort? When is your next harvesting season?

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:21.328
MATT: "I mean, there's no deadline, but the longer
that goes by, the more and more we lose by the

01:21:21.328 --> 01:21:26.109
"night. Two weeks in and we've lost half of our
livestock. If the creature is this big, I imagine

01:21:26.109 --> 01:21:27.644
"it eats quite a bit."

01:21:27.644 --> 01:21:30.439
LAURA: And how long of a ride is it? Is it walking
distance?

01:21:30.439 --> 01:21:34.426
MATT: "To... where?"

01:21:34.426 --> 01:21:36.286
LAURA, LIAM, and SAM: To your farm.

01:21:36.286 --> 01:21:37.992
MATT: "North side of Emon."

01:21:37.992 --> 01:21:39.493
LAURA: Oh, so real close!

01:21:39.493 --> 01:21:40.427
MATT: "Yes."

01:21:40.427 --> 01:21:48.311
SAM: We are friends of the elderly, obviously, and
also of the farming community, so we are very

01:21:48.311 --> 01:21:54.407
interested in helping you. May we talk about it a
bit before we decide how and when we would tackle

01:21:54.407 --> 01:21:55.732
this problem?

01:21:55.732 --> 01:22:03.883
MATT: They look at each other and nod and he taps
her hand and says, "Yes. By all means-- If you

01:22:03.883 --> 01:22:06.861
"could, please help us stop this beast from ruining
our livelihood."

01:22:06.861 --> 01:22:13.175
MARISHA: And can you please tell us how to get to
your place. Do you normally stay there? Are you

01:22:13.175 --> 01:22:14.413
normally home?

01:22:14.413 --> 01:22:19.867
MATT: "We wander about the community, but we do
have a homestead. If you look, it's the large red

01:22:19.867 --> 01:22:32.339
"wood and partially brick-based homestead closest
to the city walls, on the north farm. Right

01:22:32.339 --> 01:22:36.475
"outside of Emon. It's hard to miss, if you're
headed that direction."

01:22:36.475 --> 01:22:42.179
LIAM: Quickly. Presently, we will find you. Guys,
we were told to sit and spin basically. I mean,

01:22:42.179 --> 01:22:46.523
what's wrong with earning some brownie points in
the eyes of Uriel?

01:22:46.523 --> 01:22:49.181
TRAVIS: Mr. and Mrs. Kraut, as friends of the
elderly--

01:22:49.181 --> 01:22:51.093
MATT: "Klaus."

01:22:51.093 --> 01:22:56.147
TRAVIS: Right, Kraut. Do they normally come at
night, or have they ever abducted any of your

01:22:56.147 --> 01:22:58.147
sweet bulls during the day?

01:22:58.147 --> 01:23:02.873
MATT: "We've not seen it during the day. It'd be
easier for us to identify if we had. Seems to only

01:23:02.873 --> 01:23:04.483
"hunt at night."

01:23:04.483 --> 01:23:07.297
SAM: And have they ever messed with a human?

01:23:07.297 --> 01:23:13.486
MATT: "Not that we've heard of. Not yet." He gives
you this sudden look of realization and fear. And

01:23:13.486 --> 01:23:19.718
pats and comforts his wife who suddenly realizes,
oh my. Are they going to take us now?

01:23:19.718 --> 01:23:24.765
MARISHA: We'll probably be by like tonight or
tomorrow morning.

01:23:24.765 --> 01:23:29.131
LIAM: Yes. Tomorrow morning at the latest. We have
a little bit of business. Yeah.

01:23:29.131 --> 01:23:35.267
MARISHA: So we're in the middle of doing
something. We'll get to it.

01:23:35.267 --> 01:23:38.805
MATT: "All right. Well, thank you."

01:23:38.805 --> 01:23:41.771
LIAM: I take him by the hand and say, we will see
you presently.

01:23:41.771 --> 01:23:45.205
SAM: Here. My business card.

01:23:45.205 --> 01:23:48.824
LIAM: And you can take that to the bank.

01:23:48.824 --> 01:23:51.029
LAURA: You can't actually; it's worth nothing.

01:23:51.029 --> 01:23:57.987
MATT: "Well, thank you for listening to us ramble
on, and we look forward to hearing from you in the

01:23:57.987 --> 01:23:59.216
"next day."

01:23:59.216 --> 01:24:00.454
LAURA: You will.

01:24:00.454 --> 01:24:02.400
MATT: "All right." He pats her on the arm.

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.696
TRAVIS: Travel safe, Mr. Kraut!

01:24:03.696 --> 01:24:05.547
LIAM: Hide your bull; hide your wife.

01:24:05.547 --> 01:24:09.097
MATT: They both wander off.

01:24:09.097 --> 01:24:16.732
LAURA: We are in danger of being ostracized. We
should really be nice to everybody right now.

01:24:16.732 --> 01:24:24.610
SAM: We were just having a conversation about how
we should try to be nice from now on. But we do

01:24:24.610 --> 01:24:26.528
have very pressing matters.

01:24:26.528 --> 01:24:29.113
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's get fucking in there and talk
to that little--

01:24:29.113 --> 01:24:32.941
MARISHA: It's funny how that type of thing can
come back to bite you in the ass.

01:24:32.941 --> 01:24:36.112
SAM: I call up to Cordell. Oi, Cordell!

01:24:36.112 --> 01:24:37.455
MATT: "Yeah!"

01:24:37.455 --> 01:24:41.705
SAM: Remember when I told you not to let anyone
linger outside the keep?

01:24:41.705 --> 01:24:47.898
MATT: "To be fair, the Klauses are well-known in
the community."

01:24:47.898 --> 01:24:49.849
TRAVIS: The Krauts?

01:24:49.849 --> 01:24:51.427
LAURA: The Klauses.

01:24:51.427 --> 01:24:58.202
MATT: "They came here for business. I figured it
was probably something you'd want to hear. I

01:24:58.202 --> 01:24:59.101
"apologize."

01:24:59.101 --> 01:25:03.551
SAM: By all means, use your judgment over the
orders of your master. That's fine.

01:25:03.551 --> 01:25:05.146
MARISHA: Scanlan!

01:25:05.146 --> 01:25:09.486
MATT: Cordell bows his head sheepishly. "I
apologize. I'm sorry."

01:25:09.486 --> 01:25:11.132
MARISHA: Ignore him!

01:25:11.132 --> 01:25:14.039
LAURA: We are here to help people! We're here to
help.

01:25:14.039 --> 01:25:18.019
MATT: He does his finger like this and the gates
open in towards the inside of the keep wall.

01:25:18.019 --> 01:25:21.057
MARISHA: And what is wrong with you all today?!

01:25:21.057 --> 01:25:26.221
SAM: We had a really bad dinner last
night. That's all.

01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:28.073
LAURA: I head straight to the jail.

01:25:28.073 --> 01:25:30.333
MARISHA: I follow.

01:25:30.333 --> 01:25:33.209
MATT: As you guys are doing that, Tiberius, what's
the first thing you're trying to do?

01:25:33.209 --> 01:25:35.536
ORION: Stop by and pick up the decanter from the
temple.

01:25:35.536 --> 01:25:41.013
MATT: Okay. He said it required two days. It's
been less than a day since you dropped it off,

01:25:41.013 --> 01:25:42.715
just so you're aware.

01:25:42.715 --> 01:25:49.188
ORION: Then the only thing I do is visit the keep
with the sigils library or whatever.

01:25:49.188 --> 01:25:51.855
MATT: Oh, the Lyceum? Okay.

01:25:51.855 --> 01:25:55.561
LIAM: I'm not going. I'm just going to go hang out
up on the wall outside the keep.

01:25:55.561 --> 01:26:00.027
MATT: All right. As you head to the Lyceum, the
clerk lets you in. What are you specifically

01:26:00.027 --> 01:26:02.839
looking to find or research?

01:26:02.839 --> 01:26:07.687
ORION: The sigil that's closest to the Feywild.

01:26:07.687 --> 01:26:14.558
MATT: Okay. In researching what they have at their
disposal, you understand that the Feywild itself,

01:26:14.558 --> 01:26:21.261
because it is a separate plane, the magics to
traverse it are a little more difficult to do. If

01:26:21.261 --> 01:26:30.140
you notice-- and I'll confirm here just to be sure
that we're on the same page-- before I go full on

01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:39.197
this here. Pardon me, just a moment while I scan
through the book. The mighty book. The book of

01:26:39.197 --> 01:26:49.009
might. Yes. Sigils of teleportation require the
same plane of existence, meaning you can teleport

01:26:49.009 --> 01:26:54.559
anywhere within the Prime Material Plane that you
exist in. To traverse into the Feywild, you have

01:26:54.559 --> 01:26:59.339
to actually find a door into the Feywild, and then
you would be able to use a sigil from the

01:26:59.339 --> 01:27:00.683
Feywild.

01:27:00.683 --> 01:27:02.636
ORION: Then I only pick up my decanter.

01:27:02.636 --> 01:27:04.629
MATT: Which is not ready yet.

01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:08.786
ORION: I don't do that! Damn, I forgot! My
short-term memory is just jacked!

01:27:08.786 --> 01:27:10.728
MATT: It's all good. It's all good.

01:27:10.728 --> 01:27:12.950
TRAVIS: You know, somebody's been to the Feywild.

01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:19.450
MATT: Yeah. The Feywild. What you do find is that
the Feywild-- the boundaries between this realm

01:27:19.450 --> 01:27:28.451
and the Feywild tend to grow weaker at full moons.
It's tied to the moon cycle. And at certain

01:27:28.451 --> 01:27:36.551
places where nature is set to run wild. A lot of
druidic tribes tend to mark these locations, and

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:39.057
in some cases actually guard them.

01:27:39.057 --> 01:27:44.524
LAURA: We know where a hole in one is. Grog went
through it.

01:27:44.524 --> 01:27:52.360
MATT: And if you recall-- good memory-- in the
Frostweald, the partially frozen forest where you

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:59.950
had that conversation with the nymph-- that portal
that she existed through was specifically a door

01:27:59.950 --> 01:28:01.809
into the Feywild, which you recognized.

01:28:01.809 --> 01:28:03.204
ORION: What city was that near?

01:28:03.204 --> 01:28:04.796
MATT: That was south of Westruun.

01:28:04.796 --> 01:28:08.164
ORION: Then I'll go to the thing and I'll find the
Westruun sigil.

01:28:08.164 --> 01:28:16.623
MATT: Okay. Through your research, you do find a
sigil to Westruun. This is allowing you to go into

01:28:16.623 --> 01:28:24.089
this portion for this sigil because you've already
used the favor that you had to get the sigil of

01:28:24.089 --> 01:28:25.304
Kraghammer.

01:28:25.304 --> 01:28:29.609
ORION: No, I didn't. I used the amulet and we got
permission to come there. I saved that favor for

01:28:29.609 --> 01:28:30.552
this.

01:28:30.552 --> 01:28:33.426
MATT: Right, the favor for Gilmore. All I'm saying
is, you've used one of two favors to get that

01:28:33.426 --> 01:28:40.494
sigil. You have to invoke Gilmore's favor to get
this one. Okay. And since you're a part of the

01:28:40.494 --> 01:28:46.249
circumstance, you acquire the secondary sigil. You
now know, in your memory permanently, a sigil to

01:28:46.249 --> 01:28:49.757
Westruun. You don't know where in Westruun, but
you are connected there. If you choose to teleport

01:28:49.757 --> 01:29:02.244
there, you know how to. That favor has now been
used by Gilmore, so you can mark that. And on that

01:29:02.244 --> 01:29:06.871
note, we're going to go ahead and take a five
minute rest break. So yeah, restroom, snacks,

01:29:06.871 --> 01:29:10.926
drinks and we'll be back here in about five or so
minutes. We'll see you guys and continue this

01:29:10.926 --> 01:29:12.757
tense adventure.

01:29:12.757 --> 01:44:42.062
[break]

01:44:42.062 --> 01:44:46.705
MATT: Welcome back. We've had our break; we've
returned to the table. A quick note, we are 50

01:44:46.705 --> 01:44:48.670
subscribers away from our next giveaway.

01:44:48.670 --> 01:44:50.504
TRAVIS: 50? Come on!

01:44:50.504 --> 01:44:54.050
MATT: If we can get there, that'd be awesome!
We'll have our giveaway-- the signed cast Critical

01:44:54.089 --> 01:44:58.074
Role photo and the cast signed art poster by Kit
Buss.

01:44:58.074 --> 01:45:00.438
SAM: Kit Buss, ladies and gentlemen!

01:45:00.438 --> 01:45:10.955
MATT: Yeah! So you have all returned to the keep.
You have found yourselves down to the basement

01:45:10.955 --> 01:45:19.635
area. You hear the distant pinging of metal, an
occasional squeaking metallic noise. Like

01:45:19.635 --> 01:45:25.040
something is being altered, turned, or quenched in
a water trough. Like the process of

01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:26.516
blacksmithing.

01:45:26.516 --> 01:45:29.771
MARISHA: I go to the edge of the door and knock.

01:45:29.771 --> 01:45:39.117
MATT: As you knock on the metal door, it's like a
(boom). The pinging stops. Just hangs for a

01:45:39.117 --> 01:45:40.301
second.

01:45:40.301 --> 01:45:43.599
MARISHA: Percy? It's Keyleth.

01:45:43.599 --> 01:45:54.637
MATT: "Not right now. Please. I'm sorry. I just
need to clear my head."

01:45:54.637 --> 01:46:00.501
MARISHA: Okay. We'll be here.

01:46:00.501 --> 01:46:07.743
MATT: A moment later, you see Percy's eyes appear
at the edge of the door.

01:46:07.743 --> 01:46:09.722
MARISHA: Hi!

01:46:09.722 --> 01:46:18.152
MATT: Just looking at them, you can see they look
a little sunken, a little weary.

01:46:18.152 --> 01:46:20.145
MARISHA: Did you sleep?

01:46:20.145 --> 01:46:22.554
MATT: "Not as much as I'd like."

01:46:22.554 --> 01:46:24.619
MARISHA: Do you need anything?

01:46:24.619 --> 01:46:31.062
MATT: His eyes look away for a second, looks back
at you. "I'm all right. Thank you."

01:46:31.062 --> 01:46:38.419
MARISHA: We went and saw Uriel. Everyone in the
city hates us. They think we're all criminals.

01:46:38.419 --> 01:46:42.557
MATT: "Great. I have to get back to my work."

01:46:42.557 --> 01:46:44.256
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

01:46:44.256 --> 01:46:48.318
MATT: The slit shuts.

01:46:48.318 --> 01:46:51.819
MARISHA: Oh, we'll see you later, then.

01:46:51.819 --> 01:47:01.132
MATT: You guys, however, walk down to the other
side of the cell. The cell door's been closed. The

01:47:01.132 --> 01:47:05.870
keys are hanging on the nail by it. You have not
used the cell until this point. It's technically

01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:10.674
pristine and unused since the construction of the keep,
but the keys still hang on the key ring. On the

01:47:10.674 --> 01:47:15.981
inside of it, there is no thatch. Nothing has been
put in to really make a comfortable floor. And

01:47:15.981 --> 01:47:18.252
hanging from manacles--

01:47:18.252 --> 01:47:19.983
LAURA: He's hanging?!

01:47:19.983 --> 01:47:21.536
SAM: We're the worst.

01:47:21.536 --> 01:47:24.443
MATT: He was put in as a prisoner.

01:47:24.443 --> 01:47:30.307
LAURA: I go and get the keys, and I take him down
from the manacles.

01:47:30.307 --> 01:47:37.478
MATT: As she rushes into the cell, begins
unlocking the manacles. He's unconscious at this

01:47:37.478 --> 01:47:42.261
time. Dirt streaked on his face and spatters of
dried blood from the blast of the gun.

01:47:42.261 --> 01:47:48.971
MARISHA: I go ahead and I administer Cure Wounds.

01:47:48.971 --> 01:47:59.279
MATT: The wound at this point has been cauterized.
You cast Cure Wounds as he starts to come to

01:47:59.279 --> 01:48:08.714
consciousness, in a heap on the ground. (coughs)
It appears he may be healed of any damage he may

01:48:08.714 --> 01:48:13.661
still be sustaining from that, but the fingers are
gone. This is beyond the magic you're capable of.

01:48:13.661 --> 01:48:23.551
He comes to consciousness on the ground, dirtied,
sore. Essentially broken before you.

01:48:23.551 --> 01:48:26.562
LAURA: Does he look like he's been bitten at all?

01:48:26.562 --> 01:48:27.970
MATT: You want to inspect?

01:48:27.970 --> 01:48:29.462
LAURA: Can I look at his neck?

01:48:29.462 --> 01:48:33.591
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

01:48:33.591 --> 01:48:36.397
LAURA: 20.

01:48:36.397 --> 01:48:42.063
MATT: Okay. You don't have a whole lot of
medicinal experience, but you take a moment and

01:48:42.063 --> 01:48:46.759
inspect both sides of his neck, tilting his head
side-to-side, as he's groaning and coming to.

01:48:46.759 --> 01:48:54.568
"What's going on?" Looking at the sides of his
neck, there does not appear to be any sign of any

01:48:54.568 --> 01:49:00.296
puncture wounds, anything that would be reminiscent 
of what your brother currently is healing from.

01:49:00.397 --> 01:49:04.136
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check to see if he is
also under a mind-control spell?

01:49:04.136 --> 01:49:10.174
MATT: At the moment, no. He is barely coming to
consciousness. There isn't enough of a presence at

01:49:10.174 --> 01:49:12.364
the moment to really read past.

01:49:12.364 --> 01:49:18.296
LAURA: Hey, there. Welcome back.

01:49:18.296 --> 01:49:20.896
MATT: "Where am I?"

01:49:20.896 --> 01:49:25.240
LAURA: You are being held, at the moment, for your
own safety.

01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:29.326
MATT: "For my own safety?"

01:49:29.326 --> 01:49:30.828
LAURA: Yeah.

01:49:30.828 --> 01:49:33.800
MATT: "How?" He looks at his hand.

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:40.002
LAURA: Well, you were captured. We're pretty sure
the Briarwoods are going to be pissed as hell that

01:49:40.002 --> 01:49:44.365
you let the carriage get hit. We're just trying to
protect you, really.

01:49:44.365 --> 01:49:48.327
MARISHA: Really?

01:49:48.327 --> 01:49:52.944
SAM: I mean, his friends all died, so.

01:49:52.944 --> 01:50:00.517
MARISHA: Do we not feel like terrible people
enough already?

01:50:00.517 --> 01:50:04.931
SAM: Let's not have this conversation in front of
the prisoner. What's your name, boy!

01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:15.397
MATT: "My name is Desmond. Desmond Otham. I am the
son of a messenger, a courier of the de Rolo

01:50:15.397 --> 01:50:16.376
"family."

01:50:16.376 --> 01:50:19.307
MARISHA: He's the son of a messenger! That's even
more ironic!

01:50:19.307 --> 01:50:21.360
LAURA: Keyleth, do you need to step outside?

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:24.289
MARISHA: No, I'm good. Continue. Son of a
messenger.

01:50:24.289 --> 01:50:30.562
LAURA: Right now, everyone is at risk. The
Briarwoods are bad people, you can attest to this,

01:50:30.562 --> 01:50:31.596
yes?

01:50:31.596 --> 01:50:35.181
MATT: "Yes."

01:50:35.181 --> 01:50:39.421
LAURA: Yes. Can you tell us everything you know
about them?

01:50:39.421 --> 01:50:47.849
MATT: "It's not going to matter. They're going to
find me. No one's supposed to get away."

01:50:47.849 --> 01:50:50.034
LAURA: You did!

01:50:50.034 --> 01:50:55.076
TRAVIS: There's always a first time.

01:50:55.076 --> 01:51:09.653
MATT: "I don't even know where to begin." He
adjusts himself, sliding back, putting his back

01:51:09.653 --> 01:51:12.780
against the wall of the cell.

01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:17.312
TRAVIS: I reach into the Bag of Holding. I pull
out the little goblet, and I pour some ale

01:51:17.312 --> 01:51:27.362
into a cup, and I hand him a little bit of ale. No,
it's fine. I take a little sip.

01:51:27.362 --> 01:51:35.816
MATT: "Please don't take offense if I don't trust
a drink from strangers who've, well, to be honest,

01:51:35.816 --> 01:51:38.473
"put me in this position."

01:51:38.473 --> 01:51:41.128
TRAVIS: All right. I put it beside him.

01:51:41.128 --> 01:51:46.213
MATT: "What do you want to know?"

01:51:46.213 --> 01:51:49.336
LAURA: We want to know if the Briarwoods--

01:51:49.336 --> 01:51:51.432
SAM: Are vampires.

01:51:51.432 --> 01:51:55.157
LAURA: Pretty much. They're vampires, right? I
mean, they're vampires.

01:51:55.157 --> 01:52:07.109
MATT: "All I know from the stories I've heard.
Mothers would tell their kids not to wander out at

01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:16.230
"night because dark things crawl in the shadows.
From what I know of vampires, they're not supposed

01:52:16.230 --> 01:52:22.773
"to go out during the day, right? But I'm sure I've
seen Lady Briarwood walk in the sun many a time."

01:52:22.773 --> 01:52:26.229
MARISHA: Only Lady Briarwood?

01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:39.847
MATT: "As I recall, yes. Lord Briarwood doesn't
make too many public appearances."

01:52:39.847 --> 01:52:49.592
SAM: Have there been any strange goings-on in
their residence? Sounds you've heard? People

01:52:49.592 --> 01:52:53.160
disappearing? Boxes coming in or out?

01:52:53.160 --> 01:53:01.308
LAURA: I cast Cure Wounds on him. I know Cure
Wounds, bitches! Level up!

01:53:01.308 --> 01:53:03.900
ORION: Have I reached the keep yet?

01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:12.258
MATT: No, not yet. You're probably about an hour
away, at this point. From the time you've taken to

01:53:12.258 --> 01:53:18.023
research, find this, learn the sigil to Westruun,
and begin your trek back. Fortunately, you got

01:53:18.023 --> 01:53:24.951
what you wanted, but you're out of the picture for
a little bit. He flinches as you put your hand up,

01:53:24.951 --> 01:53:31.384
and as you touch him, he exhales. You get
to him just as he can react, briefly.

01:53:31.384 --> 01:53:36.902
LAURA: 11. Do I add anything to that?

01:53:37.095 --> 01:53:40.123
MATT: I believe you add your Wisdom modifier to
that.

01:53:40.123 --> 01:53:41.782
LAURA: 14.

01:53:41.782 --> 01:53:57.696
MATT: He goes, "Look, my father worked for the de
Rolo family before the Briarwoods came. My father

01:53:57.696 --> 01:54:05.521
"vanished the night of their fall. My mother was
taken in madness and lost to the night this past

01:54:05.521 --> 01:54:17.905
"year. I was left alone. However, I knew the roads
well between here and Whitestone and places

01:54:17.905 --> 01:54:28.279
"between, growing up, traveling with my father. So
I was made to be a coachman for the new nobles. I

01:54:28.279 --> 01:54:32.469
"was paid, albeit little, and I was left alone.

01:54:32.469 --> 01:54:41.052
"Now, when I say the new nobles, there were nobles
that lived in Whitestone and worked along with the

01:54:41.052 --> 01:54:48.088
"de Rolos, and they helped oversee parts of the
town, the business, and the people. They had been

01:54:48.088 --> 01:54:54.946
"there for many generations of their respective
families, all under the de Rolos' guidance. But

01:54:54.946 --> 01:54:57.998
"the night the castle fell, those nobles were
dragged out.

01:54:57.998 --> 01:55:06.603
"It's strange. I mean, after the brutality of that
first night, it took days before the people of

01:55:06.603 --> 01:55:14.273
"Whitestone knew what had happened. We saw the fires,
we heard the battles, but no word of the victors

01:55:14.273 --> 01:55:21.858
"until three days had passed. We were too scared to
approach. By then, the Briarwoods called a town

01:55:21.858 --> 01:55:34.211
"meeting. They explained their new rule over the
town. A number objected, which is expected. Many

01:55:34.211 --> 01:55:43.185
"strong-willed folk in Whitestone, those days. They
were subsequently shot down at arrow-point. The

01:55:43.185 --> 01:55:45.442
"rest were quiet.

01:55:45.442 --> 01:55:53.506
"They then dragged out the noble families and executed
them, gifting their property and titles to the

01:55:53.506 --> 01:55:59.200
"various cut-throats and mercenaries they had
hired, brought across the channel to help them

01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:05.672
"take the town. They're not just two people;
they've used a lot of money and influence from wherever

01:56:05.672 --> 01:56:15.931
"they came from and brought a whole slew of very
dastardly folk, who have since been given the

01:56:15.931 --> 01:56:21.819
"titles once held by the other nobles of
Whitestone, living in their homes, taking their

01:56:21.819 --> 01:56:28.093
"tithes and most of the profits made from the businesses
they've forced us to continue to run from within

01:56:28.093 --> 01:56:37.625
"the city. A number of families fled into the woods
the night after the executions, using the shadows

01:56:37.625 --> 01:56:48.236
"of a moonless evening to keep safe. They were all
found hanging from the Sun Tree the next morning.

01:56:48.236 --> 01:56:55.639
"They kept things going as they were, mostly:
farming, logging, manning the white marble mines.

01:56:55.639 --> 01:57:04.309
"Business went as usual, all filling the pockets of
the new nobles and the Briarwoods. We were given

01:57:04.309 --> 01:57:11.562
"food, kept our immediate property. As long as we
didn't attempt to leave, we were promised safety.

01:57:11.562 --> 01:57:21.973
"That lasted for a few years, until the nobles
grew bored. Twitchy. They began to abuse the

01:57:21.973 --> 01:57:32.676
"people of Whitestone: scare us for fun, brand,
cut, steal the children, leave them back,

01:57:32.676 --> 01:57:42.640
"destroyed. They treat us like animals. Folks went
missing. I was beaten so bad by my employer, Count

01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:53.331
"Tylieri. But Lord Briarwood noticed, one night he
was passing through the city. He saw wounds on my

01:57:53.331 --> 01:58:00.957
"back when he was meeting with Count Tylieri. When
he asked me in private how I got them, I couldn't

01:58:00.957 --> 01:58:11.260
"lie. Couldn't resist him. He has a way of drawing
the truth out of you. Now, he told me this

01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:17.420
"unrefined violence was boorish to him and his
wife. That was the last I ever saw of Lord

01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:19.690
"Tylieri.

01:58:19.690 --> 01:58:26.340
"Lord and Lady Briarwood took me in as their own
driver and showed me Tylieri hanging from that

01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:35.420
"same Sun Tree the next morning. I was thankful,
then. In a strange way, life had been so terrible

01:58:35.420 --> 01:58:48.114
"for so long, it was the first time I saw someone
reach out and save me. They took me in as their

01:58:48.114 --> 01:58:54.130
"driver after that. It was a better thing to be
away from the anger and the fists of the thugs.

01:58:54.130 --> 01:59:01.730
"But the more I got to know the Briarwoods, the
more nightmarish I realized they were.

01:59:01.730 --> 01:59:10.566
"Behind the walls of that castle was no longer a
grand fortress that we heard it was. Seeing it,

01:59:10.566 --> 01:59:21.621
"keeping watch and guard over our people. No, that
was a domain of perverse magics and sacrilege, it was. The

01:59:21.621 --> 01:59:32.714
"green fog drifting out from the ground where it
stood. The same servants still run the halls, but

01:59:32.714 --> 01:59:44.984
"they aren't living. They're walking vessels of
undeath, their flesh slowly tearing away. The

01:59:44.984 --> 01:59:55.216
"garden in back lies shriveled, a foul green mist
forever pouring out. They're excavating something

01:59:55.216 --> 02:00:01.521
"in the dungeon, plundering pieces. A lot of their
attention seems to be down there; I don't know

02:00:01.521 --> 02:00:16.101
"why. I dare not wander too far down. They bring up
old things. Ancient things. Relics, books, bones.

02:00:16.101 --> 02:00:27.462
"You live in that world long enough, you believe
there is no way out. Death would be easy, though

02:00:27.462 --> 02:00:32.902
"I've seen that death is no real end there. It's
just the beginning of a whole new terrible

02:00:32.902 --> 02:00:38.517
"existence. A far worse fate."

02:00:38.517 --> 02:00:52.304
LAURA: If we keep you here, protected, would you
be willing to tell your story to someone else?

02:00:52.304 --> 02:00:58.553
MATT: "Who would you want me to tell it to?"

02:00:58.553 --> 02:01:07.149
LAURA: The emperor. The guards here. An army that
could go and fight the Briarwoods.

02:01:07.149 --> 02:01:14.781
MATT: "Maybe."

02:01:14.781 --> 02:01:21.635
MARISHA: This could be an option to save
Whitestone, and you would have your freedom.

02:01:21.635 --> 02:01:26.855
MATT: "I don't know. You don't know what it's
like. You don't know what they've done. They're

02:01:26.855 --> 02:01:28.573
"going to find me."

02:01:28.573 --> 02:01:38.346
SAM: We can protect you. We are safe here in this
keep, and you're surrounded by very powerful

02:01:38.346 --> 02:01:40.172
allies now.

02:01:40.172 --> 02:01:43.241
TRAVIS: We've stood before them, and we did not
fall.

02:01:43.241 --> 02:01:45.411
LAURA: It's true.

02:01:45.411 --> 02:01:51.364
MATT: "I'll think about it."

02:01:51.364 --> 02:02:08.944
MARISHA: Would you like to stay in the guest room
upstairs? You'd be more comfortable. You could get

02:02:08.944 --> 02:02:10.242
a good night's rest.

02:02:10.242 --> 02:02:14.084
LAURA: Far more comfortable. A little less safe.
I'm going to put it out there.

02:02:14.084 --> 02:02:20.485
MATT: That resonates with him immediately, and his
eyes flash open. "I mean no disrespect, but if

02:02:20.485 --> 02:02:22.688
"this is safe, then I'd rather stay here."

02:02:22.688 --> 02:02:27.332
LAURA: I think it is. And we will bring a bed down
to you, make sure you're comfortable. I don't want

02:02:27.332 --> 02:02:29.157
you sleeping on the floor. That's terrible.

02:02:29.157 --> 02:02:31.893
MATT: "You're all being very accommodating."

02:02:31.893 --> 02:02:41.107
TRAVIS: You'll get every consideration for
protection. We value your info very much.

02:02:41.107 --> 02:02:46.763
MARISHA: You're also the key to our own freedom,
so it's important.

02:02:46.763 --> 02:02:51.940
SAM: You also caught us on a day where we're
trying to be nicer to people.

02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:56.599
(laughter)

02:02:56.599 --> 02:02:58.747
SAM: Lucky for you.

02:02:58.747 --> 02:03:01.492
LIAM: Just be glad you're not an old woman.

02:03:01.492 --> 02:03:06.531
MATT: "I'll stay here for now."

02:03:06.531 --> 02:03:08.945
LAURA: All right.

02:03:08.945 --> 02:03:16.578
MATT: "I need to think on it. I've been promised
such protection before."

02:03:16.578 --> 02:03:18.454
SAM: From the Briarwoods?

02:03:18.454 --> 02:03:25.554
MATT: "From a few. And they're dead. An enemy of
an enemy doesn't necessarily make them a friend,

02:03:25.554 --> 02:03:27.034
"I've discovered."

02:03:27.034 --> 02:03:37.813
MARISHA: No, but it can make them allies if they
have mutual enemies. Of their enemies. It's a

02:03:37.813 --> 02:03:39.285
little complicated.

02:03:39.285 --> 02:03:43.092
MATT: This whole conversation, the emotional
recalling of everything, you can see has been very

02:03:43.092 --> 02:03:50.422
taxing on him and his still mostly conscious
state. He looks exhausted, scared, and still

02:03:50.422 --> 02:03:53.400
trying to suss out all the information coming at
him right now.

02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:56.250
MARISHA: Grog, why don't you carry the bed down
from upstairs?

02:03:56.250 --> 02:04:02.120
TRAVIS: Not a problem. Keep the goblet nearby. It
is very nice ale.

02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:04.260
MARISHA: Would you like something to eat?

02:04:04.260 --> 02:04:06.557
MATT: "Yes, please."

02:04:06.557 --> 02:04:09.497
MARISHA: We'll have our staff bring down some
food.

02:04:09.497 --> 02:04:14.194
MATT: He takes the goblet. He looks at it, smells
it, but still holds it at bay as you walk off. You

02:04:14.194 --> 02:04:19.124
eventually go-- easy enough for you-- take the
bed. You have to turn it to the side to take it

02:04:19.124 --> 02:04:21.335
out, which causes all of the cushions to fall
out.

02:04:21.335 --> 02:04:22.634
TRAVIS: Aw, shit.

02:04:22.634 --> 02:04:24.418
(laughter)

02:04:24.418 --> 02:04:29.413
TRAVIS: I grab a little pillow with my toes, and I
hobble down.

02:04:29.413 --> 02:04:32.344
MATT: It takes about 20 minutes and three trips,
but you manage to get the bed down there from the

02:04:32.344 --> 02:04:33.380
guest room.

02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:35.311
TRAVIS: Not a problem.

02:04:35.311 --> 02:04:40.109
MATT: When you fit it in the cell-- and it's not a
large cell; it's maybe ten by ten feet maximum.

02:04:40.109 --> 02:04:54.079
You place it there. As you guys walk back, you
notice as you see Grog walking back down the

02:04:54.079 --> 02:04:58.967
stairway-- right around the corner as you go down
the steps, the hallway goes to the cell, and it

02:04:58.967 --> 02:05:03.608
turns to the right and to the left to the
workshop. You see around the corner a shoulder,

02:05:03.653 --> 02:05:10.504
listening in. There's a person. And you recognize
that it is Percy. Percy has stepped out of the

02:05:10.504 --> 02:05:14.634
workshop and apparently has been hearing
everything this entire time.

02:05:14.634 --> 02:05:17.654
LAURA: Are you all right?

02:05:17.654 --> 02:05:22.563
MATT: "I'm fine." And Percy immediately steps away
and you hear the door close with a slam.

02:05:22.563 --> 02:05:24.516
LAURA: Give him time.

02:05:24.516 --> 02:05:26.344
SAM: So moody!

02:05:26.344 --> 02:05:35.115
LAURA: So yeah, I'm going to lock it. I'm just
going to lock your door. To make sure you're safe,

02:05:35.115 --> 02:05:37.728
make sure nobody can get in.

02:05:37.728 --> 02:05:46.168
MATT: "Keep him away from me. Who is that?"

02:05:46.168 --> 02:05:53.286
SAM: He's a friend. I know it doesn't seem like it
from the condition of your paw, but he's a friend.

02:05:53.286 --> 02:05:59.077
He's in the same boat as you, trying to stay safe
from danger.

02:05:59.077 --> 02:06:03.565
LAURA: The Briarwoods destroyed his family, as
well.

02:06:03.565 --> 02:06:12.279
MATT: And you see now, there's like this look of
tension on his face that's mixed with tired. And

02:06:12.279 --> 02:06:16.354
eventually finding the bed and takes the goblet--
still filled, has not drunk from it-- just slips it

02:06:16.354 --> 02:06:19.052
next to the side of the bed. Eventually food is
brought down.

02:06:19.052 --> 02:06:21.595
LAURA: And a chamber pot, because come on!

02:06:21.595 --> 02:06:29.223
MATT: All the basic pleasantries are brought
within the cell. He lies on the bed and takes the

02:06:29.223 --> 02:06:32.815
plate up with him and starts just scarfing some of
the bread rolls down. And immediately starts going

02:06:32.815 --> 02:06:36.706
for the mashed potatoes. You can see a decent meal
hasn't been had in quite a while. Especially the

02:06:36.706 --> 02:06:40.582
journey, what is essentially a seven to eight day
journey from Whitestone, probably has not been

02:06:40.582 --> 02:06:47.757
very kind to him. Eats and then promptly passes
out on the bed. Food still mashed on the side of

02:06:47.757 --> 02:06:50.510
the face. Just goes straight into a slumber.

02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:55.728
TRAVIS: Is there any other entrance to the cell
area besides the door? No barred windows or

02:06:55.728 --> 02:06:57.000
anything like that?

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:02.445
MATT: No. It's underground. It's all solid, solid
stone walls. And there is the barred front door,

02:07:02.445 --> 02:07:07.292
and then just goes right into the hallway that
goes up the stairs to your left and across the way

02:07:07.292 --> 02:07:08.990
and around the corner to the workshop.

02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:13.267
TRAVIS: You can't cast any kind of alarm system? A
trigger?

02:07:13.267 --> 02:07:15.872
LAURA: So that Percy can't get anything through
there?

02:07:15.872 --> 02:07:23.772
MARISHA: Let me reference my spell tome. It's not
a common one. It's situational. But let me check

02:07:23.772 --> 02:07:28.502
real quick. I haven't read that chapter from my
book in a while.

02:07:28.502 --> 02:07:33.760
ORION: Is Allura on the way back from the
Lyceum?

02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:43.672
MATT: No, the Lyceum is in the Erudite District.
Allura's tower is in the Cloudtop, which is the

02:07:43.672 --> 02:07:45.923
central part of Emon.

02:07:45.923 --> 02:07:51.447
LAURA: I do want to go check out that bird
creature at the farmhouse tonight.

02:07:51.447 --> 02:07:53.884
SAM: Yes. Well, have we stationed a guard down
there?

02:07:53.884 --> 02:07:57.518
TRAVIS: We should. We have five or six.

02:07:57.518 --> 02:08:01.774
SAM: All right. I'll go talk to Cordell. That's
his name, right?

02:08:01.774 --> 02:08:04.048
TRAVIS: No, not Cordell. Let's get somebody else.

02:08:04.048 --> 02:08:07.665
LAURA: Get the crossbow guy that we like so much.
The guy that's the captain of the guards.

02:08:07.665 --> 02:08:12.563
SAM: Is that Kendrick? Or Shayne? Oh, the girl?

02:08:12.563 --> 02:08:16.348
LAURA: No, the guy. He's awesome and he's an
archer, as well.

02:08:16.348 --> 02:08:17.250
SAM: Jarett?

02:08:17.250 --> 02:08:18.697
LAURA: Jarett. That's it!

02:08:18.697 --> 02:08:22.803
SAM: All right, we'll get Jarett. Oh, Jarett?

02:08:22.803 --> 02:08:26.403
MATT: You make your way to the back part of the
wall, and there is a small tower that's

02:08:26.403 --> 02:08:31.930
constructed as part of the back wall. That's where
Jarett usually keeps watch. Jarett has the

02:08:31.930 --> 02:08:36.538
in-between shift between the guards, so he can be
present for both sides and keep a watch during the

02:08:36.538 --> 02:08:43.826
afternoon until the nighttime. Probably till about
midnight or so. So as you make your way out of the

02:08:43.826 --> 02:08:49.844
keep, Tiberius, are you heading back to the keep
or are you heading toward the Cloudtop District?

02:08:49.844 --> 02:08:56.502
This will dictate whether or not you show up
around this time.

02:08:56.502 --> 02:08:59.618
ORION: I'm going to Allura's.

02:08:59.618 --> 02:09:04.120
LAURA: I'm staying down in the prison, just for
the time being. I don't want to leave him alone

02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:05.607
with Percy.

02:09:05.607 --> 02:09:11.862
MATT: You go to find Jarett, who's up at the top
of the tower. And as you call to him, Jarett leans

02:09:11.862 --> 02:09:23.000
over. And you see him, you know, short jet-black
hair, darker complexion. Very handsome, younger,

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:28.368
early-twenties guy. Well-dressed over his studded
leather armor that he wears underneath and has the

02:09:28.368 --> 02:09:33.264
crossbow on the side. He leans over. "Scanlan, it
has been some time. It is so good to hear from

02:09:33.264 --> 02:09:36.404
"you. What can I be of service for?"

02:09:36.404 --> 02:09:41.470
SAM: We need you to watch a prisoner for us,
downstairs in our jail cell, which we had built

02:09:41.470 --> 02:09:49.333
and are now using. You'll be guarding the prisoner
to make sure he doesn't escape, but also making

02:09:49.333 --> 02:09:57.833
sure he stays safe. He possesses information
that's very valuable to us. And one of the people

02:09:57.833 --> 02:10:07.320
who hires you might try to kill him, so if Percy
tries to go in there, can you stop him without

02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:09.677
hurting either party?

02:10:09.677 --> 02:10:18.757
MATT: "I imagine this would be very well-suited
for my skill set. It will be strange to keep watch

02:10:18.757 --> 02:10:25.290
"against one of my employers, but he's been a bit
sheepish around me anyway."

02:10:25.290 --> 02:10:28.562
SAM: You think you could take Percy?

02:10:28.562 --> 02:10:31.384
MATT: "Well, I think I can at least talk some
sense into him!"

02:10:31.384 --> 02:10:32.703
TRAVIS: I like him!

02:10:32.703 --> 02:10:38.948
SAM: Wow! Jarett, you're ballsy! Just out of
curiosity, if he was running at you, what would

02:10:38.948 --> 02:10:39.890
you do?

02:10:39.890 --> 02:10:43.391
(laughter)

02:10:43.391 --> 02:10:48.225
MATT: "Well, first and foremost, I would dive in
the forward motion, leg out, to put him off

02:10:48.225 --> 02:10:53.398
"balance. This would be from a frontal melee--
you're messing with me, aren't you?"

02:10:53.398 --> 02:10:55.067
SAM: A little bit!

02:10:55.067 --> 02:10:59.662
MATT: "Ah, gnomes! Very well."

02:10:59.662 --> 02:11:02.475
SAM: Do you need anything to help?

02:11:02.475 --> 02:11:08.271
MATT: "I have access to my own private armory, and
I have utmost faith."

02:11:08.271 --> 02:11:14.489
SAM: All right. Well, keep him safe and there's an
extra five gold in it for you?

02:11:14.489 --> 02:11:15.965
LAURA: Oh! Pathetic!

02:11:15.965 --> 02:11:18.359
SAM: I don't know! Ten! Ten gold!

02:11:18.359 --> 02:11:19.683
MATT: "Gnomes."

02:11:19.683 --> 02:11:22.802
SAM: I don't know how money works. We'll talk to
Vex about it.

02:11:22.802 --> 02:11:27.619
MATT: "Certainly. All right. I will do this." And
he stands up, and goes and starts gathering his

02:11:27.619 --> 02:11:32.164
general setup supplies inside the guard tower. As
you walk back to the keep, you hear him whistle

02:11:32.164 --> 02:11:37.104
and start calling out to Shayne to go ahead and
take over, up in the tower.

02:11:37.104 --> 02:11:45.974
LIAM: I wasn't there for any of that. I was
upstairs on the roof, just thinking.

02:11:45.974 --> 02:11:56.917
MATT: Tiberius, you make your way into the
Cloudtop District. As you come to the front gates

02:11:56.917 --> 02:12:01.812
of the district, the guards that normally
recognize you and welcome you in, recognize you

02:12:01.812 --> 02:12:04.892
and stand firm, weapons at the ready.

02:12:04.892 --> 02:12:06.971
ORION: At Allura's tower?

02:12:06.971 --> 02:12:10.248
MATT: At the Cloudtop District entirely. You guys
had to get written permission to enter there when

02:12:10.248 --> 02:12:14.251
you first came to Emon, anyway, since that's where
the nobility and many of the important figures of

02:12:14.251 --> 02:12:19.456
Emon reside. It appears that since you've been
taken out of the Council and you're under

02:12:19.456 --> 02:12:25.930
investigation, your access to such a sensitive
location within Emon has been temporarily revoked,

02:12:25.930 --> 02:12:28.749
and the guards are not letting you through.

02:12:28.749 --> 02:12:34.682
ORION: Is that it? So I just turn around? Go
back?

02:12:34.682 --> 02:12:37.838
MATT: It's up to you. The guards are just there,
standing.

02:12:37.838 --> 02:12:49.348
ORION: Greeting and salutations. I'm Tiberius
Stormwind from Draconia. Moreover, a member of Vox

02:12:49.348 --> 02:12:58.394
Machina, over at Greyskull Keep. It seems that you
all are posturing and whatnot. (chuckles) It's

02:12:58.394 --> 02:13:04.442
adorable. But I'm here to see Lady Allura. Could
you let her know that I would like to speak to

02:13:04.442 --> 02:13:09.480
her, or get out of my way so I can just go over
there and tell her myself?

02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:13.432
MATT: "We have direct orders to not let you or any
other member of Vox Machina into the Cloudtop

02:13:13.432 --> 02:13:19.730
"District until your investigation is complete. So
no, and no."

02:13:19.730 --> 02:13:27.230
ORION: Well, do the second thing. If you don't do
one thing, do one of the other things.

02:13:27.230 --> 02:13:34.783
MATT: "Your information and wish has been
processed, taken into consideration. Thank you

02:13:34.783 --> 02:13:36.565
"very much. Please be on your way."

02:13:36.565 --> 02:13:44.578
ORION: Oh, it has been, it has been processed! Oh,
that's good to know! I appreciate that. Very well.

02:13:44.578 --> 02:13:47.487
I cast Fly on myself and I go back to the keep.

02:13:47.487 --> 02:14:04.873
MATT: Okay. (whoosh) They both did not expect that
exit. You essentially Superman-ed. You're just

02:14:04.873 --> 02:14:11.692
like (thud). Little cloud of smoke in the shape of
a dragonborn left behind. All right. So as you

02:14:11.692 --> 02:14:16.471
cruise over, you see in the distance, from where
you're standing at the top of the keep, you see a

02:14:16.471 --> 02:14:23.856
distant bead of dark shadow that approaches and
grows larger, and it is an air-cruising Tiberius

02:14:23.856 --> 02:14:26.929
making his way towards the keep.

02:14:26.929 --> 02:14:32.852
LIAM: I hide behind-- I don't want to get hit, so
I'm going to crouch down a little bit, carefully

02:14:32.852 --> 02:14:38.603
behind one of the pieces of wall. Yeah. Rough
landings, sometimes.

02:14:38.603 --> 02:14:41.833
ORION: I fly in. Vox Machina!

02:14:41.833 --> 02:14:45.191
LIAM: Easy. Be careful.

02:14:45.191 --> 02:14:48.905
ORION: Sorry. Hi. What are you doing? Are you up
here thinking?

02:14:48.905 --> 02:14:57.475
LIAM: Why, I suppose I was. The others are
downstairs interrogating that boy. Where have you

02:14:57.475 --> 02:14:58.913
been?

02:14:58.913 --> 02:15:06.011
ORION: Off doing things that wasn't really that
productive, overall, but they don't like me

02:15:06.011 --> 02:15:09.487
anywhere, especially now.

02:15:09.487 --> 02:15:12.799
LIAM: Do you want to have a drink?

02:15:12.799 --> 02:15:14.664
ORION: Yes, actually, I do.

02:15:14.664 --> 02:15:17.953
LIAM: I've got a flask. You normally drink water.
You want a shot, though?

02:15:17.953 --> 02:15:22.586
ORION: Yes, I would love some alcohol. This calls
for alcohol.

02:15:22.586 --> 02:15:29.451
LIAM: I pull out my flask, and I'm amazed, because
I've never seen this and I hand it over to him.

02:15:29.451 --> 02:15:32.649
ORION: Oh yes. (whoosh)

02:15:32.649 --> 02:15:35.644
SAM: Did you eat the flask?

02:15:35.644 --> 02:15:38.271
ORION: No, fire breath.

02:15:38.271 --> 02:15:42.865
LIAM: Do you want to pass that bad boy back? Is it
hot?

02:15:42.865 --> 02:15:44.592
MATT: It's empty.

02:15:44.592 --> 02:15:49.049
LIAM: Oh, it's empty! Well, I guess that was worth
it.

02:15:49.049 --> 02:15:53.188
ORION: (slurred) What? What are you talking about?
Don't you tell me how to drink. Oh, you!

02:15:53.188 --> 02:16:00.478
TRAVIS: I come out from the castle into the
courtyard, and I go, hey! I feel like chicken

02:16:00.478 --> 02:16:03.276
tonight! Can we go hunt this big bird?

02:16:03.276 --> 02:16:06.705
LIAM: Tiberius-- I just got him drunk!

02:16:06.705 --> 02:16:07.863
TRAVIS: Really?

02:16:07.863 --> 02:16:11.540
ORION: (slurred) He gave me a shot of his flask
water, and it's so good.

02:16:11.540 --> 02:16:14.602
TRAVIS: Are you sure you didn't hit him with the
blunt side of your knife again?

02:16:14.602 --> 02:16:18.558
LIAM: No, no, he took a shot of the old firewater,
and I don't know. We might want to slap him a

02:16:18.558 --> 02:16:19.655
bit--

02:16:19.655 --> 02:16:24.160
ORION: (slurred) Allura doesn't like me anymore
because I killed that bitch who tried to kill us,

02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:26.784
and now she's fucking-- nobody likes us!

02:16:26.784 --> 02:16:28.416
LIAM: Let's find Keyleth.

02:16:28.416 --> 02:16:32.602
TRAVIS: Yeah. Smart. Keyleth!

02:16:32.602 --> 02:16:36.521
MARISHA: What? I was reading. What?

02:16:36.521 --> 02:16:38.622
TRAVIS: Tibs got turnt up. Will you fix it?

02:16:38.622 --> 02:16:39.995
MARISHA: How?

02:16:39.995 --> 02:16:41.659
ORION: Vax gave me--

02:16:41.659 --> 02:16:44.237
MARISHA: What did you do? Why are you touching
me?

02:16:44.237 --> 02:16:47.397
ORION: Oh, I love protecting you, it is-- and
Lockheed is, he loves you, too--

02:16:47.397 --> 02:16:49.131
MARISHA: Don't touch me right now!

02:16:49.131 --> 02:16:52.174
ORION: See, I'm telling you, nobody likes me.

02:16:52.174 --> 02:16:56.636
LIAM: I gave him his first drinky. I'm sorry. Do
you think you could pull him out of it?

02:16:56.636 --> 02:16:58.044
MARISHA: What?

02:16:58.044 --> 02:17:01.961
LIAM: I thought he was going to say no! He didn't
leave me any.

02:17:01.961 --> 02:17:14.584
ORION: It's good. Hi. How are you? I'm Tiberius--
Draconia. You are princess pretty face. He likes

02:17:14.584 --> 02:17:16.583
you, too.

02:17:16.583 --> 02:17:23.180
LIAM: Vax walks away, off the roof. Out of here.
I'm gone!

02:17:23.180 --> 02:17:25.117
TRAVIS: Grog is riveted.

02:17:25.117 --> 02:17:29.479
ORION: Human kissy mouth, with you is-- (vomits)

02:17:29.479 --> 02:17:32.343
(laughter)

02:17:32.343 --> 02:17:36.117
ORION: I'm good.

02:17:36.117 --> 02:17:38.250
MARISHA: If you touch me one more time!

02:17:38.250 --> 02:17:40.617
ORION: Oh! Sorry. Did you need to go somewhere?

02:17:40.617 --> 02:17:47.244
MARISHA: I am doing something else, a request that
was already made previously, before "can we fix

02:17:47.244 --> 02:17:51.814
"drunk Tiberius," so I'm a little busy! Why don't
you go sleep it off, take a nap, and I will deal

02:17:51.814 --> 02:17:53.629
with you in a second.

02:17:53.629 --> 02:17:55.024
ORION: Is it sleepy time?

02:17:55.024 --> 02:17:56.127
MARISHA: For you.

02:17:56.127 --> 02:17:57.721
ORION: Should I cast Fireball?

02:17:57.721 --> 02:18:05.266
MARISHA: Oh my god. And I shove him into the cell
and put him in bed--

02:18:05.266 --> 02:18:08.575
TRAVIS: No, we're not in the prison. We're out in
the courtyard.

02:18:08.575 --> 02:18:12.184
MARISHA: Oh, I thought that you said-- everyone
was like, Keyleth!

02:18:12.184 --> 02:18:16.285
LAURA: I'm still in the prison. Everybody else is
out of the prison.

02:18:16.285 --> 02:18:19.366
MATT: So where do you push him?

02:18:19.366 --> 02:18:22.025
ORION: She pushed me off the roof.

02:18:22.025 --> 02:18:24.627
MARISHA: No! I thought we were downstairs.

02:18:24.627 --> 02:18:28.788
ORION: I fall off the roof. I still have Fly on
myself, don't I?

02:18:28.788 --> 02:18:34.862
MARISHA: You don't fall off the roof. I don't know
what I do with him. I let him pass out.

02:18:34.862 --> 02:18:38.005
ORION: I'm going to get a sandwich.

02:18:38.005 --> 02:18:40.499
MARISHA: I let him go get a sandwich.

02:18:40.499 --> 02:18:43.118
SAM: I encourage sandwich!

02:18:43.118 --> 02:18:47.211
(laughter)

02:18:47.211 --> 02:18:53.746
MATT: That's the quote of the night. Encouraged to
get a sandwich, Tiberius wanders off. What are you

02:18:53.746 --> 02:18:56.196
doing to prepare what you were doing?

02:18:56.196 --> 02:18:58.290
MARISHA: I don't know! I got distracted!

02:18:58.290 --> 02:18:59.563
ORION: I'm not there.

02:18:59.563 --> 02:19:00.692
MARISHA: Okay.

02:19:00.692 --> 02:19:04.326
MATT: Well, as the day progresses, what would you
guys like to do?

02:19:04.326 --> 02:19:12.953
MARISHA: Wait. My idea. Okay. We were wanting
extra fortification? We were wanting extra

02:19:12.953 --> 02:19:21.508
protection. Okay? I can't necessarily cast a big
spell. I could cast Hallucinatory Terrain. We have

02:19:21.508 --> 02:19:25.685
a few options; I'm giving them to you all. I can
cast Hallucinatory Terrain to make this look like

02:19:25.685 --> 02:19:30.552
something else. I don't think-- I don't know. I
don't know if that's a good idea. I don't know. I

02:19:30.552 --> 02:19:38.965
could conjure a few woodland beings for, like, extra
bears. We could have some bears guarding the

02:19:38.965 --> 02:19:47.842
palace. I could also throw up a Wall of Thorns, to
barrier the cell with the wall of thorns. You're

02:19:47.842 --> 02:19:49.488
not here?

02:19:49.488 --> 02:19:53.496
SAM: I think everyone left. I think it's just you
and me up here, and drunk Tiberius.

02:19:53.496 --> 02:19:59.956
MARISHA: I went downstairs, and I'm saying this to
the group so I don't have to repeat myself!

02:19:59.956 --> 02:20:04.371
ORION: Oh, so then I turn around with my sandwich
and am like, we have to just make Allura talk to

02:20:04.371 --> 02:20:06.289
us. She can fix everything.

02:20:06.289 --> 02:20:13.015
TRAVIS: I grab Tiberius's mouth and I cover it.
Please continue.

02:20:13.015 --> 02:20:14.742
SAM: Wall of Thorns could be good.

02:20:14.742 --> 02:20:16.662
LAURA: I like Wall of Thorns.

02:20:16.662 --> 02:20:22.738
MARISHA: The thing with Wall of Thorns is it's not
super big. It's 60 feet.

02:20:22.738 --> 02:20:24.020
SAM: That's pretty big!

02:20:24.020 --> 02:20:25.744
LAURA: Oh. That's not the whole place, though.

02:20:25.744 --> 02:20:29.707
SAM: Oh, 60 feet long. I thought you meant high.

02:20:29.707 --> 02:20:34.468
MARISHA: No, it's 100 feet high. It's really high.
Actually, I don't know how high it is. Don't quote

02:20:34.468 --> 02:20:41.227
me on that. But it's not that long, but we could
fortify the doors more. Have bears. We could do

02:20:41.227 --> 02:20:43.086
multiple things, too.

02:20:43.086 --> 02:20:48.874
LIAM: I think that the Hallucinatory Terrain
wouldn't work. I felt like they could see right

02:20:48.874 --> 02:20:50.224
through me.

02:20:50.224 --> 02:20:51.530
TRAVIS: I think so, too.

02:20:51.530 --> 02:20:52.756
MARISHA: On the Briarwoods?

02:20:52.756 --> 02:20:54.835
LAURA: Yeah, they can see through illusions pretty
darn well.

02:20:54.835 --> 02:20:57.356
SAM: Listen, Percy's here. He can defend for us.

02:20:57.356 --> 02:20:59.265
ORION: No, you need a warding spell.

02:20:59.265 --> 02:21:02.869
SAM: Why don't we just leave someone behind?

02:21:02.869 --> 02:21:05.392
MARISHA: Percy's behind.

02:21:05.392 --> 02:21:11.065
TRAVIS: Percy's here and so are five? Six? How
many employees do we have?

02:21:11.065 --> 02:21:13.329
LAURA: Our very capable guards.

02:21:13.329 --> 02:21:17.800
TRAVIS: Why don't you make some extra bears that
don't hate us?

02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:19.325
MARISHA: Huh?

02:21:19.325 --> 02:21:21.768
TRAVIS: Why don't you make some extra bears that
don't hate us?

02:21:21.768 --> 02:21:23.518
MARISHA: All right, I'll make some extra bears.

02:21:23.518 --> 02:21:25.971
ORION: Put some little hats on them and make them
cute.

02:21:25.971 --> 02:21:30.065
LIAM: Do you think you could fix him? Because he's
a lot of firepower if we're going to go--

02:21:30.065 --> 02:21:34.715
MARISHA: What gets rid of drunkenness? (laughs)

02:21:34.715 --> 02:21:36.056
LAURA: Maybe Restoration?

02:21:36.056 --> 02:21:37.634
MATT: Restoration would probably take care of it.

02:21:37.634 --> 02:21:40.423
MARISHA: I don't want to burn a Restoration spell
on your drunkenness.

02:21:40.423 --> 02:21:42.835
LAURA: Can you cast little Restoration?

02:21:42.835 --> 02:21:46.723
MATT: You could also just give it a couple of
hours. Drink a lot of water.

02:21:46.723 --> 02:21:48.718
TRAVIS: What time is it?

02:21:48.718 --> 02:21:54.346
MATT: At this point, it's probably close to 3:00
in the afternoon.

02:21:54.346 --> 02:22:01.504
TRAVIS: So it's 3:00 in the afternoon. The bird
doesn't even come until night. We could let him

02:22:01.504 --> 02:22:03.706
wear it off.

02:22:03.706 --> 02:22:05.408
MARISHA: What time is it?

02:22:05.408 --> 02:22:08.069
SAM: 3:00. We just established this. We're going
to wait until night and go.

02:22:08.069 --> 02:22:11.746
LAURA: She said she hated you. How did that feel?

02:22:11.746 --> 02:22:18.183
LIAM: Fine. That was fine. That was the heat of
the moment. She was angry. We're a team.

02:22:18.183 --> 02:22:21.566
MATT: All right. What's the plan, guys?

02:22:21.566 --> 02:22:25.469
SAM: The plan is we're going to let him sober up.
We're going to give him some coffee. And then

02:22:25.469 --> 02:22:29.745
we're going to set off for the north farmlands at
dusk.

02:22:29.745 --> 02:22:35.371
ORION: Oh, we should get some corn and other
harvestments at the farms.

02:22:35.371 --> 02:22:38.625
MARISHA: I make an army of bears.

02:22:38.625 --> 02:22:40.683
MATT: &nbsp;Okay. This concentration will last an
hour.

02:22:40.683 --> 02:22:42.091
LAURA: Oh! That's it.

02:22:42.091 --> 02:22:43.670
MATT: The Conjure Woodland Beings?

02:22:43.670 --> 02:23:02.128
MARISHA: Wait! No! Hang on. What if I conjure a
bear, and then-- let me make sure, while they

02:23:02.128 --> 02:23:04.495
figure their stuff out. See, we're all figuring
stuff out?

02:23:04.495 --> 02:23:09.760
LAURA: What if I leave Trinket in the prison with
Jarett?

02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:12.717
TRAVIS: Yeah! That won't freak him out at all.

02:23:12.717 --> 02:23:17.734
SAM: Well, with Cordell. Jarett's down in the
cell. This is defense against invading vampires.

02:23:17.734 --> 02:23:21.247
MARISHA: Okay! I have a better idea!

02:23:21.308 --> 02:23:22.156
TRAVIS: Yep?

02:23:22.156 --> 02:23:23.684
SAM: Oh my god.

02:23:23.684 --> 02:23:30.277
MARISHA: Why don't I conjure an elemental, and
then I can cast Planar Binding on him and he'll

02:23:30.277 --> 02:23:31.908
hang out for 24 hours.

02:23:31.908 --> 02:23:36.180
SAM: Great! Do it. Make it done. Let's go kill a
bird.

02:23:36.180 --> 02:23:37.871
TRAVIS: Lead with that next time.

02:23:37.871 --> 02:23:40.647
MARISHA: I was figuring it out. It's new.

02:23:40.647 --> 02:23:42.282
SAM: You've got to talk it through.

02:23:42.282 --> 02:23:43.845
MARISHA: Figuring it out.

02:23:43.845 --> 02:23:45.154
TRAVIS: That's awesome!

02:23:45.154 --> 02:23:47.259
MATT: Yep! That'll do.

02:23:47.259 --> 02:23:50.592
TRAVIS: Don't vampires hate fire? Can you do fire?

02:23:50.592 --> 02:23:53.334
LAURA: Yeah, fire! Fire elemental!

02:23:53.334 --> 02:23:54.761
LIAM: Running water.

02:23:54.761 --> 02:23:57.788
LAURA: Ooh, water elemental! (gasps) Tiberius,
remember that you--

02:23:57.788 --> 02:23:58.891
TRAVIS: He's drunk!

02:23:58.891 --> 02:23:59.921
LAURA: I know.

02:23:59.921 --> 02:24:01.151
SAM: Don't talk to him.

02:24:01.151 --> 02:24:03.234
TRAVIS: He won't remember anything.

02:24:03.234 --> 02:24:06.043
ORION: (slurred) I love how you shoot arrows at
things' eyeballs.

02:24:06.043 --> 02:24:13.218
SAM: I use Minor Illusion to create Lockheed, and
I have him scamper away.

02:24:13.218 --> 02:24:18.576
ORION: Oh, that's you. But where are you going? You
go play up there. Tell your brother to be good.

02:24:18.576 --> 02:24:20.721
Anyway, you're so pretty.

02:24:20.721 --> 02:24:28.452
MATT: So are you doing that, Marisha? Keyleth, are
you summoning an elemental?

02:24:28.452 --> 02:24:29.739
MARISHA: Yes.

02:24:29.739 --> 02:24:31.409
MATT: Okay. Which kind?

02:24:31.409 --> 02:24:34.113
MARISHA: Water elemental.

02:24:34.113 --> 02:24:38.534
MATT: Okay. And you cast Planar Binding. Part of
the material component cost is a gem that's worth

02:24:38.534 --> 02:24:40.248
at least 1,000 gold pieces.

02:24:40.248 --> 02:24:42.341
TRAVIS: I have one of those.

02:24:42.341 --> 02:24:45.277
LAURA: You do?

02:24:45.277 --> 02:24:48.027
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's a jewel that's red and
palm-sized.

02:24:48.027 --> 02:24:53.832
LAURA: I have a diamond of awesome. And a regular
diamond, as well.

02:24:53.832 --> 02:25:02.334
LIAM: If I create a trap here, can you bind some
magic to it?

02:25:02.334 --> 02:25:08.863
ORION: You can do anything with magic. You can
make things go. You can make things stop.

02:25:08.863 --> 02:25:11.247
TRAVIS: I cover Tiberius's mouth again.

02:25:11.247 --> 02:25:12.865
LAURA: I give her a diamond.

02:25:12.865 --> 02:25:15.499
MATT: All right. Is this the awesome diamond or
the regular diamond?

02:25:15.499 --> 02:25:18.864
LAURA: This is a regular diamond. The awesome
diamond is special.

02:25:18.864 --> 02:25:20.418
MATT: All right.

02:25:20.418 --> 02:25:23.990
LAURA: No! Don't do that!

02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:26.082
MARISHA: I know! Why do you do that?

02:25:26.082 --> 02:25:29.429
LAURA: Diamonds are really expensive! Any
diamonds!

02:25:29.429 --> 02:25:34.188
MARISHA: I know! And an awesome diamond has got to
be more than 1,000, so this time there's got to be

02:25:34.188 --> 02:25:38.845
at least 1,000. Grog, what kind of jewel do you
have?

02:25:38.845 --> 02:25:41.565
TRAVIS: It's a palm-sized ruby.

02:25:41.565 --> 02:25:43.438
MARISHA: A palm-sized ruby?

02:25:43.438 --> 02:25:45.866
TRAVIS: Yeah, I got a big palm!

02:25:45.866 --> 02:25:47.522
MARISHA: Tiberius.

02:25:47.522 --> 02:25:49.726
SAM: No, just don't.

02:25:49.726 --> 02:26:00.886
MATT: Vex. Your keen eye is able to ascertain that
the palm-sized ruby is worth roughly 1,200 gold

02:26:00.886 --> 02:26:03.818
pieces and would be suitable for this ritual.

02:26:03.818 --> 02:26:08.505
LAURA: I think we should use the ruby. Because I
have an eye for these things.

02:26:08.505 --> 02:26:13.050
TRAVIS: Do we think they're going to come while we
do this? Do we want to waste it? Because that's an

02:26:13.050 --> 02:26:20.365
awesome outside defense. Do we want to waste it
for this? What if they're coming? Does it cost one

02:26:20.365 --> 02:26:21.695
jewel per--

02:26:21.695 --> 02:26:22.752
MATT: Yeah.

02:26:22.752 --> 02:26:26.126
TRAVIS: Maybe we should save that, because that's
awesome!

02:26:26.126 --> 02:26:34.173
LIAM: Is there a possibility, DM, that I could--
if he's sobered up-- if I set a trap, that a spell

02:26:34.173 --> 02:26:38.419
of his could be bound to it, somehow, and go off?
I have no idea.

02:26:38.419 --> 02:26:46.188
MATT: It's hard to say. There are certain spells
that can enable that. That can take certain spells

02:26:46.188 --> 02:26:51.432
that trigger at a certain time. Nothing that's
particularly in your guys' realm of experience or

02:26:51.432 --> 02:26:53.104
understanding though, unfortunately.

02:26:53.104 --> 02:26:55.212
LIAM: All right. So I can look into it for the
future, but not today.

02:26:55.212 --> 02:26:58.963
TRAVIS: Keyleth, I like that. I think we should
keep it in case there is an actual attack coming.

02:26:58.963 --> 02:27:03.000
Because it might just, 24 hours and then we waste
it. Nobody came.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:08.302
MARISHA: That's true. To be fair, the castle's
being heavily watched by outsiders, as well.

02:27:08.302 --> 02:27:12.350
SAM: Okay! Listen. Let's just go.

02:27:12.350 --> 02:27:17.604
ORION: Grog is big. Scanlan's small. Everything is
great. Hi.

02:27:17.604 --> 02:27:20.497
LIAM: Can we leave Trinket? To watch.

02:27:20.497 --> 02:27:24.169
LAURA: What? He's going to go down in the prison
with Jarett.

02:27:24.169 --> 02:27:31.627
MATT: Okay. You bring Trinket down. Trinket stands
watch right in the center, plops down right up

02:27:31.627 --> 02:27:32.887
against the bars.

02:27:32.887 --> 02:27:35.384
LAURA: I knock on Percy's door and say, Percy?

02:27:35.384 --> 02:27:37.084
MATT: "Yes?"

02:27:37.084 --> 02:27:43.327
LAURA: Trinket's out here. If you need anything,
you just come out and you pet him.

02:27:43.327 --> 02:27:45.964
MATT: "Thank you."

02:27:45.964 --> 02:27:47.571
LAURA: Welcome.

02:27:47.571 --> 02:27:51.885
ORION: I also go up to the door and go, Trinket.
(mumbling) Percy.

02:27:51.885 --> 02:27:54.038
LAURA: Aren't you sober yet?

02:27:54.038 --> 02:27:57.054
ORION: No, it's been like five minutes, hasn't
it?

02:27:57.054 --> 02:28:04.443
MATT: Yeah. Over time, over the next two to three
hours or so, you guys have set up a place to go.

02:28:04.443 --> 02:28:07.671
They have given you some water, and you've managed
to sober up a bit.

02:28:07.671 --> 02:28:11.988
LIAM: I actually picked his pocket and took his
bottle of endless water. Don't you have a bottle

02:28:11.988 --> 02:28:13.326
of water like that?

02:28:13.326 --> 02:28:19.203
MATT: No. That is currently left to be blessed for
holy water.

02:28:19.203 --> 02:28:21.825
LIAM: Oh. Oh, well.

02:28:21.825 --> 02:28:27.624
TRAVIS: And we take the scenic route to let him
walk it off as we head up towards Big Bird's

02:28:27.624 --> 02:28:29.496
house.

02:28:29.496 --> 02:28:30.987
SAM: Great!

02:28:30.987 --> 02:28:38.046
MATT: All right. So. You guys make your way around
the outskirts of Emon under moonlight. It's a

02:28:38.046 --> 02:28:46.792
three-quarter waxing moon. You make your way to
the farm vicinity on the north side of the city.

02:28:46.792 --> 02:28:52.592
It doesn't take long for you to eventually suss
out the house that matches the description that

02:28:52.592 --> 02:28:59.756
you were given by the Klauses. You knock on the
door, and they eagerly greet your arrival and

02:28:59.756 --> 02:29:08.732
invite you in. "So glad you all could make it.
Have you decided? Have you given our community's

02:29:08.732 --> 02:29:11.641
"request some thought?"

02:29:11.641 --> 02:29:14.880
SAM: We're here to help. We're the heroes that you
asked for.

02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:16.393
TRAVIS: We love old people.

02:29:16.393 --> 02:29:24.649
MATT: "Thank you. That's really good of you. We
will happily provide you with fresh produce, going

02:29:24.649 --> 02:29:28.265
"forward. We've talked to a few of the members of
the community and we're going to make sure that's

02:29:28.265 --> 02:29:29.358
"taken care of."

02:29:29.358 --> 02:29:33.315
SAM: Where do you think we should stake out this
bird? Where are your livestock kept?

02:29:33.315 --> 02:29:39.302
MATT: "The livestock are kept on the eastern side
of this community. If you look about, say about

02:29:39.302 --> 02:29:47.432
"half a mile out to where the actual residences
stop being clustered together, you'll see there

02:29:47.432 --> 02:29:54.585
"are a number of large livestock containment areas.
Hard to miss out there. We have pens for sheep; we

02:29:54.585 --> 02:30:01.132
"have pens for cows; we have pens for horses, other
beasts of burden. That whole vicinity is where

02:30:01.132 --> 02:30:05.278
"most of these attacks seem to be coming. So that's
probably your best bet there."

02:30:05.278 --> 02:30:08.045
LIAM: And the biggest you have are the bulls, you
said?

02:30:08.045 --> 02:30:12.211
MATT: "Bulls. We have a few big cows, as well.
We've lost a few of them, unfortunately."

02:30:12.211 --> 02:30:17.284
TRAVIS: That'll be all we need.

02:30:17.284 --> 02:30:21.827
LAURA: Can one of us polymorph into a giant cow?

02:30:21.827 --> 02:30:23.319
SAM: Sure.

02:30:23.319 --> 02:30:27.282
MARISHA: I could also talk to cows again. Maybe
these cows will know something.

02:30:27.282 --> 02:30:30.788
TRAVIS: We head out to the pasture.

02:30:30.788 --> 02:30:36.045
MARISHA: First can I ask her, you said your
neighbor boy, Kyle?

02:30:36.045 --> 02:30:40.307
SAM: Kyle. The neighbor boy. The neighbor boy's
son. Yes.

02:30:40.307 --> 02:30:43.483
MATT: "That's true. Kyle's the one who originally
spotted it, yeah."

02:30:43.483 --> 02:30:45.366
MARISHA: Where does he live?

02:30:45.366 --> 02:30:51.139
MATT: "He's actually the son of the man who runs
most of the livestock areas over there. You can go

02:30:51.139 --> 02:30:54.343
"and head over there. He's probably still up,
keeping his eye out in case it comes back."

02:30:54.343 --> 02:30:56.460
MARISHA: Thank you. I go to Kyle.

02:30:56.460 --> 02:31:03.333
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way over there.
It's easy to find. There's large pens. You can see

02:31:03.333 --> 02:31:09.157
that for as big as the pens are built and their
structure, they are noticeably dwindled. You can

02:31:09.157 --> 02:31:13.960
see why there's been some worry in the community
here. The fact that it's only been two weeks and

02:31:13.960 --> 02:31:22.120
this many creatures are gone is a little
disconcerting. As you get there, you can see the

02:31:22.120 --> 02:31:28.363
house has its light on. There are glowing windows.
And sitting in a chair, holding a crossbow across

02:31:28.363 --> 02:31:40.042
his lap, you see a 19-year-old boy, rugged chin
growth, dirty red hair that's disheveled. And he's

02:31:40.042 --> 02:31:44.570
sitting there looking around in the sky. Rocking
back and forth in his chair as you approach. "Who

02:31:44.570 --> 02:31:45.667
"goes there?"

02:31:45.667 --> 02:31:51.448
SAM: Don't worry, we're friends. We're friends of
the Klauses. Mr. and Mrs. Klaus.

02:31:51.448 --> 02:31:55.497
MATT: "Okay. Okay. So you the ones they say was
coming to help?"

02:31:55.497 --> 02:31:56.848
MARISHA: Yes.

02:31:56.848 --> 02:31:58.201
TRAVIS: Aye.

02:31:58.201 --> 02:31:59.901
LAURA: We hear you have a keen eye, Kyle.

02:31:59.901 --> 02:32:03.091
MATT: "I've seen some things, yeah."

02:32:03.091 --> 02:32:06.294
SAM: Where have they been attacking lately?

02:32:06.294 --> 02:32:11.955
MATT: Points to the whole area in front of him and
says, "Are you keeping watch now? Great. Thank

02:32:11.955 --> 02:32:13.145
"you."

02:32:13.145 --> 02:32:17.363
MARISHA: No! Wait! Don't leave yet. We need you.

02:32:17.363 --> 02:32:23.200
ORION: Yes, yes. Keyleth. We are Vox Machina. Over
from Greyskull Keep. I'm Tiberius Stormwind.

02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:30.045
MARISHA: That's irrelevant. The point is, I was
wondering if you had any more information about

02:32:30.045 --> 02:32:32.523
the creature.

02:32:32.523 --> 02:32:42.533
MATT: "I mean, other than the fact that it was
just a really big bird. Really big. Huge."

02:32:42.533 --> 02:32:46.691
MARISHA: Do you remember any other details? Any
other defining details other than "bird?"

02:32:46.691 --> 02:32:48.825
MATT: "It's hard to see in the moonlight."

02:32:48.825 --> 02:32:53.835
SAM: When it picks up a cow or whatever it's been
picking up, does it strike with the beak or the

02:32:53.835 --> 02:32:55.109
claws? The talons.

02:32:55.109 --> 02:32:59.292
MATT: "Claws, and sometimes it takes two at a
time, one in each claw, and just carries them

02:32:59.292 --> 02:33:00.262
"away. "

02:33:00.262 --> 02:33:02.686
ORION: Have you seen any of its droppings
anywhere?

02:33:02.686 --> 02:33:04.618
MATT: "No. "

02:33:04.618 --> 02:33:08.053
TRAVIS: Have you managed to hit it with your
crossbow?

02:33:08.053 --> 02:33:11.372
MATT: "I've missed."

02:33:11.372 --> 02:33:16.462
LIAM: And you're certain this is a feathered
beast, or no?

02:33:16.462 --> 02:33:22.532
MATT: "Best I can see. It's dark out here at that
time of night and it looks like a bird. It doesn't

02:33:22.532 --> 02:33:29.021
"make any noise and swoops on down and takes them
away and flies off in that direction."

02:33:29.021 --> 02:33:34.109
TRAVIS: I've heard that those giant birds are
attracted to red-headed, 19-year-old, scruffy-chin

02:33:34.109 --> 02:33:36.217
folk with crossbows.

02:33:36.217 --> 02:33:38.543
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

02:33:38.543 --> 02:33:41.569
TRAVIS: Awesome.

02:33:41.569 --> 02:33:43.689
MATT: This would be with your charisma.

02:33:43.689 --> 02:33:44.975
TRAVIS: 22.

02:33:44.975 --> 02:33:56.666
MATT: Nice. He goes, "Well, I don't want to be
here, then. You guys can keep an eye out. I've got

02:33:56.666 --> 02:33:59.790
"to go." And unloads the bolt in the crossbow,
slings it up under his arm--

02:33:59.790 --> 02:34:06.654
SAM: Wait! Before you leave. I'm sorry. I have an
itch. And it can only be scratched with a cowbell.

02:34:06.654 --> 02:34:15.811
Do you have a cowbell anywhere around here? I just
need a cowbell. Can I borrow a cowbell from you?

02:34:15.811 --> 02:34:18.067
MATT: "Your kid's weird." And he keeps walking.

02:34:18.067 --> 02:34:19.728
MARISHA: Your kid is weird!

02:34:19.728 --> 02:34:21.692
SAM: I'm not a child!

02:34:21.692 --> 02:34:24.535
LAURA: Do I see any cowbells on the ground?

02:34:24.535 --> 02:34:33.124
MATT: You can take a glance about. You eventually
can see that there is set up on one of the fences

02:34:33.124 --> 02:34:35.224
that fences in the cows, there is a cowbell, yes.

02:34:35.224 --> 02:34:36.591
LAURA: Hey, there's a cowbell, Scanlan.

02:34:36.637 --> 02:34:44.882
SAM: Great. It will help the ruse. Here's my plan:
we're all cows. Is that an okay plan?

02:34:44.882 --> 02:34:46.078
LAURA: I like it!

02:34:46.078 --> 02:34:50.278
MARISHA: I'm into this plan. But doesn't that
essentially make us the bait?

02:34:50.278 --> 02:34:52.714
SAM: Yes, we're our own bait. Are you cool with
that?

02:34:52.714 --> 02:34:54.888
LAURA: Should one of us maybe not be a cow?

02:34:54.888 --> 02:34:58.154
MARISHA: Well, here's the thing, maybe a few of us
should not be cows because only a few people are

02:34:58.154 --> 02:35:02.775
going to have the ability to turn out of being a
cow once they are a cow, unless they take damage.

02:35:02.775 --> 02:35:06.045
TRAVIS: We went from all cows to pretty much
no one is a cow.

02:35:06.045 --> 02:35:11.633
LAURA: No, Keyleth is definitely a cow. No, I
mean-- I didn't-- we didn't mean like that. You're

02:35:11.633 --> 02:35:13.718
very lovely.

02:35:13.718 --> 02:35:18.062
MARISHA: It's okay. What Vax said was way worse,
earlier.

02:35:18.062 --> 02:35:19.936
TRAVIS: How do you come out of being a cow, if you
are one?

02:35:19.936 --> 02:35:21.408
SAM: I can get rid of it.

02:35:21.408 --> 02:35:27.864
TRAVIS: You would do it? Let's do it! When else
are we all going to be cows? Come on! Unless it

02:35:27.864 --> 02:35:30.793
kills them instantly, we'll be fine.

02:35:30.793 --> 02:35:32.964
ORION: I'm fine. I go invisible.

02:35:32.964 --> 02:35:34.642
MATT: Okay.

02:35:34.642 --> 02:35:42.890
LAURA: I'm going to lay in wait with an arrow. All
the rest of you can be cows.

02:35:42.890 --> 02:35:46.034
LIAM: I think I'm better served waiting to
strike.

02:35:46.034 --> 02:35:49.909
SAM: You and me, Grog. We're cows!

02:35:49.909 --> 02:35:55.448
LIAM: If it grabs one of them, I'll deal more
damage. If it grabs me, I'll deal no damage. But

02:35:55.448 --> 02:35:57.950
if it grabs Scanlan cow, I can--

02:35:57.950 --> 02:36:04.602
MARISHA: Another thing is, I can turn into a cow.
I can turn someone else into a cow. Well,

02:36:04.602 --> 02:36:07.604
Polymorph is a concentration spell.

02:36:07.604 --> 02:36:09.659
SAM: I can turn us all into cows.

02:36:09.659 --> 02:36:11.863
MARISHA: Oh. Because you got that thing.

02:36:11.863 --> 02:36:15.228
TRAVIS: Cow or no, Keyleth? Give us your answer.

02:36:15.228 --> 02:36:16.988
MARISHA: Oh, I'm a cow.

02:36:16.988 --> 02:36:18.415
SAM: Seeming.

02:36:18.415 --> 02:36:22.519
ORION: Oh, we are not actually cows?

02:36:22.519 --> 02:36:25.280
SAM: We'll just seem like cows.

02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:29.024
MARISHA: Except for me who is going to be an
actual cow.

02:36:29.024 --> 02:36:37.191
ORION: If it's Polymorph, I couldn't cast stuff. I
redact my Invisibility and I'll be a cow. I'm also

02:36:37.191 --> 02:36:39.959
going to be a cow. I want to be a brown cow.

02:36:39.959 --> 02:36:42.637
MARISHA: We're all cows! Just embrace it.

02:36:42.637 --> 02:36:45.135
MATT: You can't change a target's body type.

02:36:45.135 --> 02:36:46.955
SAM: What? No.

02:36:46.955 --> 02:36:49.945
MATT: So the same form of your limbs-- you're
right.

02:36:49.945 --> 02:36:58.631
SAM: You can't change size, but we can all be
Grog-sized cows or Scanlan-sized cows.

02:36:58.631 --> 02:37:03.592
MATT: It's going to be an array of very
strangely sized cows.

02:37:03.592 --> 02:37:07.439
MARISHA: Scanlan would be like a calf. Big calf.

02:37:07.439 --> 02:37:10.824
SAM: What do you think?

02:37:10.824 --> 02:37:12.357
MATT and SAM: I'll allow it!

02:37:12.357 --> 02:37:15.332
(cheering and laughter)

02:37:15.332 --> 02:37:17.748
SAM: Gather close to me!

02:37:17.748 --> 02:37:21.046
TRAVIS: We want to get in the pen first, right?

02:37:21.046 --> 02:37:24.842
SAM: Yes, let's go into the pen, and if I may, I'm
going to wear the cow bell.

02:37:24.842 --> 02:37:27.474
TRAVIS: Sure! You've earned it.

02:37:27.474 --> 02:37:29.711
(laughter)

02:37:29.711 --> 02:37:32.230
LAURA: How you going to put it? I'm just going to
put it around your neck right now.

02:37:32.230 --> 02:37:34.204
TRAVIS: Super loose.

02:37:34.204 --> 02:37:39.070
MATT: You guys make your way into the cow pen. The
little bit of moonlight that's coming down from

02:37:39.070 --> 02:37:42.470
the sky illuminates. You see the cows are
clustered underneath this overhang that is used

02:37:42.470 --> 02:37:52.895
for temporary shelter. You hear this distant
(mooing) as you approach and make noise. No one's

02:37:52.895 --> 02:37:56.539
not too upset yet. It's more low muttering.

02:37:56.539 --> 02:37:58.169
TRAVIS: What if that was attraction?

02:37:58.169 --> 02:37:59.250
MATT: Not yet.

02:37:59.250 --> 02:38:04.988
MARISHA: If we use Seeming, we just appear to be
cows, but we can still speak, right?

02:38:04.988 --> 02:38:07.921
MATT: Yeah. Anything sees you as cows--

02:38:07.921 --> 02:38:11.230
MARISHA: Would be like, holy shit, those are
talking cows!

02:38:11.230 --> 02:38:14.449
SAM: It's "cow-moo-flage."

02:38:14.449 --> 02:38:16.964
(groaning)

02:38:16.964 --> 02:38:19.183
SAM: Thank you.

02:38:19.183 --> 02:38:20.668
ORION: That's good.

02:38:20.668 --> 02:38:27.041
MATT: I have to give you experience for that.

02:38:27.041 --> 02:38:30.427
(laughter)

02:38:30.427 --> 02:38:33.916
LIAM: Wait. What's going on? Are we turning into
cows?

02:38:33.916 --> 02:38:37.285
SAM: We just will seem like cows.

02:38:37.285 --> 02:38:39.013
LIAM: I don't understand magic.

02:38:39.013 --> 02:38:40.611
TRAVIS: Just go along. Go along.

02:38:40.611 --> 02:38:43.461
LAURA: That way we can ambush the bird.

02:38:43.461 --> 02:38:46.623
MARISHA: We are going to look like cows. Are we
going to look like cows to each other, too?

02:38:46.623 --> 02:38:48.177
MATT: You'll find out.

02:38:48.177 --> 02:38:49.538
MARISHA: Okay.

02:38:49.538 --> 02:38:56.475
MATT: As you all gather around the small gnome,
currently adorned with the cowbell around his

02:38:56.475 --> 02:38:57.637
neck.

02:38:57.637 --> 02:38:59.634
LIAM: Just like the brothels, eh?

02:38:59.634 --> 02:39:05.574
MATT: You complete the spell and with a sudden
(whoosh) of cold night air, your vision blurs and

02:39:05.574 --> 02:39:10.579
you blink for a second. You look around and Vox
Machina is now, instead, an array of slightly

02:39:10.579 --> 02:39:12.511
smaller than average cows.

02:39:12.511 --> 02:39:15.176
(mooing)

02:39:15.176 --> 02:39:17.631
SAM: (barks) Oh, wait. No.

02:39:17.631 --> 02:39:19.970
MATT: You're, by the way, more of a calf.

02:39:19.970 --> 02:39:25.311
LAURA: You are so cute, Scanlan.

02:39:25.311 --> 02:39:27.144
MARISHA: Okay, shall we go interview some cows?

02:39:27.144 --> 02:39:32.768
LAURA: Let's go talk to some cows. I want to walk
over to the cows with you.

02:39:32.768 --> 02:39:37.805
MATT: You guys step up, awkwardly, towards the
cows, some of which are sleeping, some of which

02:39:37.805 --> 02:39:41.353
are noticing and sitting there just chewing.

02:39:41.353 --> 02:39:43.103
MARISHA: Which one looks like the alpha male?

02:39:43.103 --> 02:39:44.950
LAURA: The one that's got horns.

02:39:44.950 --> 02:39:50.082
MATT: There are no males in this pen, because they
are cows.

02:39:50.082 --> 02:39:58.143
ORION: I try to speak to the cow.

02:39:58.143 --> 02:40:00.804
MATT: Okay. What do you say?

02:40:00.804 --> 02:40:04.471
ORION: Hello, I'm Tiberius Stormwind from
Draconia.

02:40:04.471 --> 02:40:08.551
MATT: You speak Common. You don't know Cow.

02:40:08.551 --> 02:40:15.078
MARISHA: Tiberius, just because you look like a
cow doesn't mean you can talk to the cows. The

02:40:15.078 --> 02:40:19.359
cows don't understand English. No matter if you
look like a cow, they still don't understand

02:40:19.359 --> 02:40:20.532
Common.

02:40:20.532 --> 02:40:22.756
LIAM: Boy, if Uriel could see us now.

02:40:22.756 --> 02:40:24.773
(laughter)

02:40:24.773 --> 02:40:27.099
TRAVIS: We are "cow-nsel" worthy.

02:40:27.099 --> 02:40:30.032
MARISHA: I cast Speak With Animals.

02:40:30.032 --> 02:40:35.636
MATT: This is the best Vox Machina adventure ever!
All right, you cast Speak With Animals.

02:40:35.636 --> 02:40:41.584
MARISHA: Yes. Actually, how many animals can I hit
with Speak with Animals? It is called Animals,

02:40:41.584 --> 02:40:43.428
right? Or is it just Speak with Animal?

02:40:43.428 --> 02:40:47.602
MATT: I think it affects you. I think it gives you
the ability to speak with.

02:40:47.602 --> 02:40:49.136
MARISHA: Oh, just me the ability?

02:40:49.136 --> 02:40:50.516
ORION: You're Dr. Doolittle.

02:40:50.516 --> 02:40:54.263
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. I think you're right. Okay, so
I cast Speak With Animals on myself.

02:40:54.263 --> 02:40:59.824
MATT: All right. Yep! On self for ten minutes.

02:40:59.824 --> 02:41:05.022
ORION: Make sure the cow-- What? She may know a
cow that is over there.

02:41:05.022 --> 02:41:10.035
MARISHA: Okay, so I go up. Is there a cluster of
nice-looking ladies, sitting around?

02:41:10.035 --> 02:41:13.825
MATT: All the cows are clustered in this one
corner, up against each other for body warmth.

02:41:13.825 --> 02:41:16.303
And there are few that are just like (moo).

02:41:16.303 --> 02:41:18.336
MARISHA: Hello, ladies. Good evening.

02:41:18.336 --> 02:41:27.049
MATT: (moo) Which is what you guys hear. You hear
as a response: "What are you doing? We're trying

02:41:27.049 --> 02:41:28.385
"to sleep."

02:41:28.385 --> 02:41:37.418
MARISHA: I do apologize to awaken you. I was just
curious if you could tell me a little bit about

02:41:37.418 --> 02:41:44.665
some of the events that have been transpiring
around here lately? Mainly, the results of your

02:41:44.665 --> 02:41:46.596
kind getting killed?

02:41:46.596 --> 02:41:48.593
MATT: "My kind?"

02:41:48.593 --> 02:41:50.214
ORION: Just ask about the bird!

02:41:50.214 --> 02:41:53.702
MARISHA: Have you seen a giant bird flying around?
Anyone?

02:41:53.702 --> 02:42:01.191
MATT: At which point, all the cows start shuddering and
say, "Yes. Haven't you? It keeps taking us. Why do

02:42:01.238 --> 02:42:03.162
"you think we're hiding under this?"

02:42:03.162 --> 02:42:05.105
MARISHA: Oh, sure.

02:42:05.105 --> 02:42:08.295
MATT: "Be careful. If you stay out there, it'll
see you."

02:42:08.295 --> 02:42:17.401
MARISHA: Right. Where, exactly? Where have they
been-- okay. Damn, cows! It's never--

02:42:17.401 --> 02:42:22.358
SAM: Keyleth, what vital information have you
learned?

02:42:22.358 --> 02:42:30.137
MARISHA: I'll get back to you in one second. Can
you tell me anything about what it looks like?

02:42:30.137 --> 02:42:38.209
MATT: "It's big and has wings. It's fast, and it
keeps taking us."

02:42:38.209 --> 02:42:44.211
ORION: Ask her where the moon is at night--

02:42:44.211 --> 02:42:47.453
MARISHA: Does it seem to come at a certain time of
the night?

02:42:47.453 --> 02:42:49.853
MATT: "The dark time."

02:42:49.853 --> 02:42:55.215
ORION: It's a cow. This is the same as before.

02:42:55.215 --> 02:42:58.277
TRAVIS: Because nothing is happening I am now
trying to eat grass.

02:42:58.277 --> 02:43:03.214
MATT: You bend down, and take clusters with your
hand, and start eating grass.

02:43:03.214 --> 02:43:05.211
ORION: Oh, we are ourselves, still?

02:43:05.211 --> 02:43:08.289
MATT: Yeah, you are not actually physically cows.
You are still yourselves. You just look like

02:43:08.289 --> 02:43:09.104
cows.

02:43:09.104 --> 02:43:11.456
SAM: I, for once, and it's not weird, I just shit
on the floor.

02:43:11.456 --> 02:43:14.218
(laughter)

02:43:14.218 --> 02:43:15.961
SAM: Seems totally normal.

02:43:15.961 --> 02:43:18.458
TRAVIS: We are in it, baby!

02:43:18.458 --> 02:43:23.829
LAURA: I'm just going to notch a bow to my bow,
just to keep a lookout to the sky.

02:43:23.829 --> 02:43:25.220
MATT: Okay.

02:43:25.220 --> 02:43:27.020
ORION: Can I Prestidigitate smells?

02:43:27.020 --> 02:43:28.471
MATT: You could.

02:43:28.471 --> 02:43:31.564
ORION: Sweet. Go ahead.

02:43:31.564 --> 02:43:34.214
(laughter)

02:43:34.214 --> 02:43:37.763
SAM: All right, so we go out into the field.

02:43:37.763 --> 02:43:42.295
MARISHA: They're cows. I forgot that talking to
cows never goes well.

02:43:42.295 --> 02:43:44.275
LAURA: Yeah, remember Dork?

02:43:44.275 --> 02:43:48.047
MARISHA: Didn't seem to know a lot. They're
simple-minded beasts.

02:43:48.047 --> 02:43:49.528
LAURA: Dork the ox.

02:43:49.528 --> 02:43:51.441
MARISHA: Yeah, poor Dork. Dork the ox.

02:43:51.441 --> 02:43:52.914
MATT: Rest in peace, Dork.

02:43:52.914 --> 02:43:55.742
TRAVIS: Pour a little out.

02:43:55.742 --> 02:44:03.410
MATT: You guys make your way. You wait a while, a
good two-hour period, as cows, before eventually

02:44:03.410 --> 02:44:09.728
you, keeping your eye to the sky with your arrow nocked,
see a whisk of shadow across the moonlight.

02:44:09.728 --> 02:44:11.139
LAURA: (whistles)

02:44:11.139 --> 02:44:13.748
TRAVIS: What was that?

02:44:13.748 --> 02:44:16.237
LAURA: I'm letting you guys fucking know there's
a thing in the sky.

02:44:16.237 --> 02:44:17.862
ORION: Is it Jumanji time?

02:44:17.896 --> 02:44:19.280
SAM: Not quite.

02:44:19.280 --> 02:44:27.491
MATT: At this point, you guys look up, and you see
something circle once. It looks like a bird. It's

02:44:27.491 --> 02:44:31.525
just not as big as you were expecting. Looks like
a bigger hawk.

02:44:31.525 --> 02:44:33.255
ORION: I cast Stoneskin on myself.

02:44:33.255 --> 02:44:39.284
MATT: Okay. Bigger and bigger

02:44:39.284 --> 02:44:41.286
LIAM: My cow is going stealth.

02:44:41.286 --> 02:44:43.217
MATT: Roll for cow stealth!

02:44:43.217 --> 02:44:45.806
(laughter)

02:44:45.806 --> 02:44:48.113
LIAM: 23.

02:44:48.113 --> 02:44:51.315
MATT: Okay. You're still a cow.

02:44:51.315 --> 02:45:04.030
MARISHA: I make myself look available. I step away
from the rest of the herd a little bit.

02:45:04.030 --> 02:45:07.131
TRAVIS: I go into a cow rage and start chewing
faster.

02:45:07.131 --> 02:45:10.399
MATT: You would like to chew! All right.

02:45:10.399 --> 02:45:13.339
LAURA: I Hunter's Mark it.

02:45:13.339 --> 02:45:15.255
MATT: Okay. Well, it has to come within range
first.

02:45:15.255 --> 02:45:16.699
LAURA: As soon as it is.

02:45:16.699 --> 02:45:20.258
MATT: As it swoops down, you see this bird just
gets larger and larger and you realize it was

02:45:20.258 --> 02:45:25.045
quite a distance away. And now that it's getting
closer, the tales you've heard are true. This is

02:45:25.045 --> 02:45:28.123
at least a 100-foot wing span, if not more.

02:45:28.123 --> 02:45:30.847
ORION: I'm going to fix my ring on it.

02:45:30.847 --> 02:45:32.744
MARISHA: 100-foot wing span?

02:45:32.744 --> 02:45:37.186
ORION: As it gets close I'm going to brace my ring
as it's coming towards us.

02:45:37.186 --> 02:45:45.223
MATT: Okay. It comes. It dives down with extreme
speed and goes into a dive. It comes into range.

02:45:45.223 --> 02:45:47.703
You cast Hunter's Mark on it. You have your ring
ready. What you doing?

02:45:47.703 --> 02:45:49.046
ORION: Cast Slow on it!

02:45:49.046 --> 02:45:52.607
MATT: Cast Slow? All righty. What is the DC on
that?

02:45:52.607 --> 02:45:54.053
ORION: 17.

02:45:54.053 --> 02:45:55.422
MATT: And what is the save?

02:45:55.422 --> 02:45:59.395
SAM: Is it wisdom or charisma or something?

02:45:59.395 --> 02:46:03.067
ORION: It's concentration! No, wait, it is a
concentration.

02:46:03.067 --> 02:46:13.827
MATT: Yes it is. That's okay. I'm finding it. All
right, it is wisdom. All right. Oh! What was the

02:46:13.827 --> 02:46:14.861
DC?

02:46:14.861 --> 02:46:15.719
ORION: 17.

02:46:15.719 --> 02:46:24.325
MATT: 17. That is an 18. Rolled a natural 18 on
that one. As it swoops down, you release the spell,

02:46:24.325 --> 02:46:37.468
you are immediately attempting to be grasped in
its talons. That is a 23 to hit.

02:46:37.468 --> 02:46:39.334
MARISHA: That hits.

02:46:39.334 --> 02:46:45.576
MATT: All right. So you then take 23 points of
slashing damage to your cow form.

02:46:45.576 --> 02:46:48.503
LAURA: I thought we were just--

02:46:48.503 --> 02:46:53.883
MATT: Oh. Okay. Sorry. You're not in cow form, are
you? You're illusioned. You're staying normal?

02:46:53.883 --> 02:46:55.383
MARISHA: No, I'm normal.

02:46:55.383 --> 02:46:59.568
MATT: You're normal. Right. Okay. I thought you
were saying you were doing an actual cow form, but

02:46:59.568 --> 02:47:06.100
no. All right. You take 23 points of slashing
damage, and you are currently grappled as it takes

02:47:06.100 --> 02:47:09.822
right back up into the air, clutching Keyleth
within its talons.

02:47:09.822 --> 02:47:11.933
LIAM: How fast can the rest of us do anything?
It's gone?

02:47:11.933 --> 02:47:16.746
MATT: Now you guys can react. It is currently 60
feet away from you.

02:47:16.746 --> 02:47:21.084
LAURA: I immediately-- oh god! I shoot it.

02:47:21.084 --> 02:47:24.917
SAM: Do we have to roll for initiative?

02:47:24.917 --> 02:47:26.272
MATT: You do.

02:47:26.272 --> 02:47:29.742
LAURA: But I was notched already.

02:47:29.742 --> 02:47:36.199
MATT: Right. I'll give you advantage on your
initiative. Because you're notched but you used

02:47:36.199 --> 02:47:42.615
your last turn to cast Hunter's Mark on it.
Everyone roll initiative. You have advantage on it

02:47:42.615 --> 02:47:45.515
because you were nocked, and because you were
ready to react, you have advantage on your

02:47:45.515 --> 02:47:56.712
initiative check, but everyone else just roll
normally. All right. So that is 25 to 20?

02:47:56.712 --> 02:47:57.945
LAURA: 21.

02:47:57.945 --> 02:47:59.307
MATT: 21.

02:47:59.307 --> 02:48:00.659
MATT: 20 to 15?

02:48:00.659 --> 02:48:01.835
LIAM: 17.

02:48:01.835 --> 02:48:02.786
TRAVIS: 18.

02:48:02.786 --> 02:48:04.081
MARISHA: 16.

02:48:04.081 --> 02:48:12.365
MATT: Vax. Keyleth. Scanlan? Tiberius? What you
guys got?

02:48:12.365 --> 02:48:13.510
SAM: Six.

02:48:13.510 --> 02:48:15.485
ORION: Five.

02:48:15.485 --> 02:48:19.794
MATT: Okay. All right. So Vex, you're up first.

02:48:19.794 --> 02:48:23.405
LAURA: I'm going to shoot it through the Blazing
Bowstring.

02:48:23.405 --> 02:48:25.825
MATT: Okay. Go for it. Roll for the attack.

02:48:25.825 --> 02:48:30.342
LAURA: 16.

02:48:30.342 --> 02:48:32.362
MATT: 16 hits.

02:48:32.362 --> 02:48:46.429
LAURA: (counts quietly) 26.

02:48:46.429 --> 02:48:49.700
MATT: 26 points of damage. All righty.

02:48:49.700 --> 02:48:52.371
LAURA: And then I'm going to shoot it again.

02:48:52.371 --> 02:48:53.798
MATT: Go for it.

02:48:53.798 --> 02:48:56.141
LAURA: That one definitely hits: 26.

02:48:56.141 --> 02:48:57.868
MATT: Yeah! That hits.

02:48:57.868 --> 02:49:06.206
LAURA: 26 again.

02:49:06.206 --> 02:49:10.784
MATT: Nice! All right, that brings us to Grog.

02:49:10.784 --> 02:49:16.556
TRAVIS: I take the Firebrand Warhammer, activate
it, turn on the fire. And I put the Chain of

02:49:16.556 --> 02:49:20.263
Returning on it and throw it at the winged beast.

02:49:20.263 --> 02:49:27.862
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll with disadvantage
because it's already roughly 40 to 60 feet away

02:49:27.862 --> 02:49:32.399
from you. It's tough to get there. But you can
try.

02:49:32.399 --> 02:49:42.917
TRAVIS: 15. Nope. 16.

02:49:42.917 --> 02:49:50.429
MATT: Okay. Due to its distance and the dark cover
of night, it's harder to hit and you actually

02:49:50.429 --> 02:49:55.100
swing and throw it and the hammer-- The chain goes
taut and it just drops to the ground and it's just

02:49:55.100 --> 02:49:58.616
out of range of the hammer, as it escapes the
range it would have hit it with.

02:49:58.616 --> 02:49:59.857
TRAVIS: Can I pull it back?

02:49:59.857 --> 02:50:02.460
MATT: Yeah, go for it. That's easy enough, it's
not wedged in anything. You don't have to roll

02:50:02.460 --> 02:50:06.208
for it. All right, so that's your turn. Vax.

02:50:06.255 --> 02:50:12.864
LIAM: I'd like to use a bonus action to click
Boots of Haste together, and I think if I do that,

02:50:12.864 --> 02:50:15.277
I have two actions at that point, right?

02:50:15.277 --> 02:50:24.960
MATT: No. Well you do have an additional action
that can be used only to attack.

02:50:24.960 --> 02:50:30.110
LIAM: Just attack. So what I want to do is click
the Boots of Haste together, use the original

02:50:30.110 --> 02:50:36.527
action to run as far as I can towards the bird,
and then use my final action to sneak attack the

02:50:36.527 --> 02:50:41.474
thing since it's got Keyleth in its talons. That's
up to you.

02:50:41.474 --> 02:50:47.520
MATT: Okay. The sneak attack will not kick in
because Keyleth is not threatening the creature.

02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:54.181
But you go for the attacks. You rush up, you dash,
you get underneath it-- for a moment, because of

02:50:54.181 --> 02:50:59.017
the Boots of Haste, you keep speed with this
giant, darting creature. You, underneath, throw

02:50:59.017 --> 02:51:00.692
your daggers upward.

02:51:00.692 --> 02:51:04.460
LIAM: All right. It would just be one-- I mean if
I use the dash to run as far as I can, that would

02:51:04.460 --> 02:51:06.079
leave me with one attack probably?

02:51:06.079 --> 02:51:08.355
MATT: One attack and your bonus without the damage
bonus.

02:51:08.355 --> 02:51:11.698
LIAM: I'm trying to be a Boy Scout here. Wouldn't
the Boots of Haste clicking be the bonus action?

02:51:11.698 --> 02:51:18.865
Yeah. That is 22 to hit.

02:51:18.865 --> 02:51:20.071
MATT: That hits.

02:51:20.071 --> 02:51:22.504
LIAM: All right. And that's not a whole lot.

02:51:22.504 --> 02:51:26.064
MATT: What's the range increment on a dagger?

02:51:26.064 --> 02:51:27.696
LIAM: That's ten. Ten.

02:51:27.696 --> 02:51:28.717
MATT: Ten?

02:51:28.717 --> 02:51:29.773
LIAM: Yeah.

02:51:29.773 --> 02:51:34.327
MATT: Dagger. Roll again for disadvantage because
it's just within your secondary throwing range.

02:51:34.327 --> 02:51:36.997
LIAM: Oh yeah. Then I missed.

02:51:36.997 --> 02:51:50.458
MATT: Okay. It vanishes into the dark night ahead
of you. So yeah. That is gone. You still have your

02:51:50.458 --> 02:51:55.470
Belt of Returning, you just don't have your snake
belt. Yeah, don't worry guys. I saw the look on

02:51:55.470 --> 02:52:03.396
your face and I'm like, no, it's fine. It comes
back. Okay. Keyleth, you're up. You're currently

02:52:03.396 --> 02:52:10.068
grappled and held within the talons of this giant
bird. You see the entire ground below you.

02:52:10.068 --> 02:52:16.857
MARISHA: Judging by the fairly close up appearance
I have of him at this point, can I tell it is

02:52:16.857 --> 02:52:19.488
probably a "beast" nature?

02:52:19.488 --> 02:52:29.830
MATT: At the sheer size, it's hard to tell. You've
never encountered a beast of this size, but you do

02:52:29.830 --> 02:52:33.271
look up and you can see the talons that are
currently holding you in place and piercing the

02:52:33.271 --> 02:52:38.819
sides of your armor are bird-like talons. And you
do see a series of dark feathers coating the

02:52:38.819 --> 02:52:41.550
entire underbelly of this entity.

02:52:41.550 --> 02:52:46.877
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to attempt to cast
Dominate Beast.

02:52:46.877 --> 02:52:49.395
MATT: Okay. All right.

02:52:49.395 --> 02:52:51.927
MARISHA: It has to make a wisdom saving throw.

02:52:51.927 --> 02:52:53.385
MATT: Okay.

02:52:53.385 --> 02:52:59.110
LAURA: Is your Enhance Ability still active? From
before?

02:52:59.110 --> 02:53:07.890
MATT: That's for ability checks. So you finish
casting the spell. Apparently, this entity is not

02:53:07.890 --> 02:53:09.713
affected by the spell.

02:53:09.713 --> 02:53:11.091
LIAM: Fuck-sticks.

02:53:11.091 --> 02:53:12.311
SAM: It's not a beast?

02:53:12.311 --> 02:53:21.639
MATT: It is not a beast. There's a fine line when
certain creatures of nature are altered by some

02:53:21.639 --> 02:53:27.193
sort of magical essence or their nature perhaps is
not natural at the get-go. Either they were

02:53:27.193 --> 02:53:31.131
created or over time they became something beyond
beast. This seems to fall under that category.

02:53:31.131 --> 02:53:35.801
MARISHA: That's my turn, right?

02:53:35.801 --> 02:53:39.854
MATT: That's your turn. That brings us to its
turn.

02:53:39.854 --> 02:53:44.770
MARISHA: Can I try and break the grapple as a
bonus action?

02:53:44.770 --> 02:53:52.963
MATT: That would be your action to try and break
the grapple. For this creature's turn, it does a

02:53:52.963 --> 02:53:57.758
full double dash of its full flight speed and is
about 250 feet away from you and completely out of

02:53:57.758 --> 02:54:05.500
your guys' reach. You see it (whoosh) up into the
sky, disappearing to the north, north-northwest

02:54:05.500 --> 02:54:09.448
area beyond Emon, carrying Keyleth in its claws.

02:54:09.448 --> 02:54:13.322
LIAM: Keyleth, just get out of its fucking hands
and fall. You can change. We'll catch you; we'll

02:54:13.322 --> 02:54:15.415
do something! Just fall.

02:54:15.415 --> 02:54:18.410
MATT: You're close enough where you can still hear
this, as the desperation kicks in and you

02:54:18.410 --> 02:54:22.586
realize-- seeing your whole party not even visible
at this point except a couple of dark dots in the

02:54:22.586 --> 02:54:26.176
low light of the night.

02:54:26.176 --> 02:54:27.628
SAM: Is it our turn yet?

02:54:27.628 --> 02:54:29.068
MATT: It now comes to Scanlan's turn.

02:54:29.068 --> 02:54:31.012
SAM: Okay. I Dimension Door.

02:54:31.012 --> 02:54:32.074
MATT: What's the range on Dimension Door?

02:54:32.074 --> 02:54:33.394
SAM: 500 feet.

02:54:33.394 --> 02:54:36.467
MATT: You-- and appear where? Where do you want to
appear?

02:54:36.467 --> 02:54:38.836
SAM: On it. On its back.

02:54:38.836 --> 02:54:48.813
MATT: Okay. You appear right on its back. You
immediately land and start sliding back as the

02:54:48.813 --> 02:54:53.132
wind is pushing on you. The feathers themselves,
due to the aerodynamic nature of its flight path;

02:54:53.132 --> 02:54:54.781
it's a lot of wind resistance against you.

02:54:54.781 --> 02:54:56.474
LIAM: Oh, make an acrobatics check.

02:54:56.474 --> 02:54:59.262
ORION: Shush! What the hell?!

02:54:59.262 --> 02:55:03.387
MATT: No, I was going there. Don't worry. That's
what it is. You need to go ahead and make an

02:55:03.482 --> 02:55:06.443
acrobatics check to see if you can maintain
balance on the back of this beast.

02:55:06.443 --> 02:55:09.716
LIAM: My intelligence is not six!

02:55:09.716 --> 02:55:12.220
SAM: 20!

02:55:12.220 --> 02:55:17.553
MATT: You manage to just, you tumble backward a
little bit. You grab a couple of feathers and get

02:55:17.553 --> 02:55:21.809
yourself just on the side underneath where the
wing meets part of the upper torso, where the wind

02:55:21.809 --> 02:55:25.869
resistance is the least amount, and you manage to
hold on. You are now clutching the back of this

02:55:25.869 --> 02:55:29.521
giant bird. That's your turn.

02:55:29.521 --> 02:55:35.850
SAM: Okay. As my bonus action, I will inspire
Keyleth. Right? She's right next to me?

02:55:35.850 --> 02:55:38.994
MARISHA: Scanlan? What the shit?

02:55:38.994 --> 02:55:47.641
SAM: (singing) The way you kick so much ass like
nobody else. The way you do animal things gets me

02:55:47.641 --> 02:55:57.093
overwhelmed. You don't know. You don't know you're
powerful. Oh. That's what makes you powerful.

02:55:57.093 --> 02:56:01.986
MATT: Due to the wind, you don't hear the last
line. It's too loud around it. However, you can

02:56:01.986 --> 02:56:03.647
take a d10 inspiration dice.

02:56:03.647 --> 02:56:05.203
LAURA and MARISHA: Yay!

02:56:05.203 --> 02:56:08.631
LIAM: What a heroic move! Amazing!

02:56:08.631 --> 02:56:14.064
MATT: Which for the record, this currently right
now looks like-- you see the cow clutched below,

02:56:14.064 --> 02:56:18.969
and currently there is a cow holding onto this
giant bird.

02:56:18.969 --> 02:56:20.544
SAM: It lasts eight hours.

02:56:20.544 --> 02:56:24.846
MATT: This singing tiny cow. You artists out
there, have fun with this scene.

02:56:24.846 --> 02:56:28.438
(laughter)

02:56:28.438 --> 02:56:31.109
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Tiberius.

02:56:31.109 --> 02:56:41.496
ORION: Good. I drop Stoneskin. At 5th-level, I go
myself, one, two, three-- I cast Fly on all of us.

02:56:41.496 --> 02:56:45.346
Fly, you fools! And go right after them.

02:56:45.346 --> 02:56:49.433
MATT: All right. All of you guys, at that point
you see Tiberius and you all take off after him.

02:56:49.433 --> 02:56:53.845
LIAM: The cows take off into the night sky.

02:56:53.845 --> 02:56:58.274
ORION: (shouting) Fly, Vox Machina! Moo!

02:56:58.274 --> 02:57:02.048
MARISHA: Vox "Moo-china!"

02:57:02.048 --> 02:57:04.128
(booing)

02:57:04.128 --> 02:57:10.760
MATT: A squadron of weirdly-sized, flying cows lit
by moonlight, chasing after a giant bird. I love

02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:12.248
Dungeons and Dragons.

02:57:12.248 --> 02:57:16.104
(laughter)

02:57:16.104 --> 02:57:17.693
TRAVIS: What is this?

02:57:17.693 --> 02:57:19.626
MATT: What's the flying speed on Fly?

02:57:19.626 --> 02:57:20.904
ORION: 60 feet.

02:57:20.904 --> 02:57:22.073
MATT: 60 feet. Cool.

02:57:22.073 --> 02:57:24.105
ORION: I'm going to dash. On that.

02:57:24.105 --> 02:57:30.954
MATT: Yep. You guys can go 120 feet every turn. It
can go 240. Two rounds pass before you guys

02:57:30.954 --> 02:57:33.968
realize there is no way you're going to catch up
with this thing or get even close to it.

02:57:33.968 --> 02:57:35.561
LIAM: I've got Haste!

02:57:35.561 --> 02:57:38.163
LAURA: I've got Hunter's Mark on it, so I can
track it.

02:57:38.163 --> 02:57:40.223
LIAM: Double me, yo! I got Haste.

02:57:40.223 --> 02:57:43.674
MATT: Your Haste speed-- your physical body
doesn't affect the Fly spell, unfortunately.

02:57:43.674 --> 02:57:51.191
You're only at the speed that the arcane nature of
the spell can take you. I'm just saying. Your

02:57:51.191 --> 02:57:54.475
metabolism's real fast. Your heartbeat's
hummingbirding it. But you're still only going 120

02:57:54.475 --> 02:58:02.737
feet. So as you guys follow behind, you can see
now, after a while on the edge of the shoreline,

02:58:02.737 --> 02:58:11.526
not too far from Emon-- maybe what would normally
be from horseback or a brisk walk, a half day's

02:58:11.526 --> 02:58:23.045
travel-- you eventually come upon the-- There it
is! You come upon the coastal mountains known as

02:58:23.045 --> 02:58:28.459
the Shoreline Summit. It's a series of unusually
steep mountain bluffs that hug the coastline,

02:58:28.459 --> 02:58:36.422
northwest of Emon. As you get closer, and at this
point you've lost sight of the bird. Scanlan, I

02:58:36.422 --> 02:58:39.817
want you to go ahead and roll an athletics check.

02:58:39.817 --> 02:58:50.654
SAM: Athletics? Well, that doesn't count.
That's not good. Athletics? 16.

02:58:50.654 --> 02:58:58.408
MATT: 16? Okay. You still manage to keep hold for
the portion of the length of the journey. As it

02:58:58.408 --> 02:59:02.513
moves and shifts and the wind itself is still
blowing in your face, though minimized by your

02:59:02.513 --> 02:59:08.793
current positioning. It's a trial to hold onto
this large creature as it makes its wings beat and

02:59:08.793 --> 02:59:14.253
just the sheer force of its movement. All right.
So as you get closer to these mountaintops--

02:59:14.253 --> 02:59:16.029
MARISHA: Do I have a turn yet?

02:59:16.029 --> 02:59:17.896
MATT: You can go ahead and take your turn now too,
yes.

02:59:17.896 --> 02:59:26.572
MARISHA: Yeah? I cast Polymorph on it. You're on
it.

02:59:26.572 --> 02:59:28.101
SAM: Don't worry about me!

02:59:28.101 --> 02:59:30.516
MARISHA: Really?

02:59:30.516 --> 02:59:37.814
SAM: I'm fine! You never need to worry about me.
Haven't you guys learned that by now? I'm fine!

02:59:37.814 --> 02:59:42.138
MARISHA: Out of thematic reasons, I also turn him
into a cow.

02:59:42.138 --> 02:59:46.760
(laughter)

02:59:46.760 --> 02:59:49.354
SAM: That's amazing!

02:59:49.354 --> 02:59:52.044
LIAM: Is what she cries out heroically.

02:59:52.044 --> 02:59:55.944
MATT: Okay. What's the DC on this?

02:59:55.944 --> 03:00:02.240
MARISHA: My spell DC? 18.

03:00:02.240 --> 03:00:03.369
MATT: Rolled a one.

03:00:03.369 --> 03:00:07.138
(laughter)

03:00:07.138 --> 03:00:09.418
SAM: I'm a cow on a cow with a cow!

03:00:09.418 --> 03:00:22.186
MATT: So this giant flying bird-- Moo! And just
begins to plummet at an extremely fast speed. You

03:00:22.186 --> 03:00:28.945
both immediately are released from its grasp.
Scanlan and Keyleth both are just falling. You

03:00:28.945 --> 03:00:33.064
guys don't see this. It's too far away from you
now. At this point, you're probably close to about

03:00:33.064 --> 03:00:36.459
500 feet in the air.

03:00:36.459 --> 03:00:39.957
LIAM: Yo, I heard you liked cows, so I gave you
some cows with your cow.

03:00:39.957 --> 03:00:46.566
MATT: I hope this inspires the next Diablo Cow
level, guys. You really need to look into this.

03:00:46.566 --> 03:00:54.195
All right. So you guys are now both plummeting and
falling at a really, really rapid speed.

03:00:54.195 --> 03:00:56.315
MARISHA: I go eagle form.

03:00:56.315 --> 03:01:00.984
MATT: Flailing cows. You go eagle form. You're
fine. So you go into eagle form. That's your

03:01:00.984 --> 03:01:03.443
action this turn. That's your bonus action,
because you can do that as a--

03:01:03.443 --> 03:01:04.869
MARISHA: As a bonus action!

03:01:04.869 --> 03:01:15.840
MATT: Eagle form. Scanlan, you plummet full speed
on this one. You probably have another two rounds

03:01:15.840 --> 03:01:18.223
before you impact with something very painful.

03:01:18.223 --> 03:01:21.980
LIAM: But he's as heavy as a dust mote, so he just
goes like this all the way down. Right?

03:01:21.980 --> 03:01:23.943
MARISHA: I don't think that's how it works.

03:01:23.943 --> 03:01:25.746
ORION: No, he's a little pebble.

03:01:25.746 --> 03:01:28.935
MARISHA: I can catch him, if you need catched.

03:01:28.935 --> 03:01:32.074
MATT: You guys still continue to give chase.
Eventually, you see this giant thing just go and

03:01:32.074 --> 03:01:35.724
vanish from sight. It's just gone. It just
disappeared.

03:01:35.724 --> 03:01:37.409
ORION: I go full Gandalf.

03:01:37.409 --> 03:01:39.086
MATT: All right.

03:01:39.086 --> 03:01:40.676
LIAM: Never go full Gandalf.

03:01:40.676 --> 03:01:46.727
MATT: You guys are pushing forward. So it's now
the next round for you guys to react. What are you

03:01:46.727 --> 03:01:48.087
doing?

03:01:48.087 --> 03:01:50.054
SAM: I will become a pterodactyl.

03:01:50.054 --> 03:01:51.336
MATT: So you're casting?

03:01:51.336 --> 03:01:52.786
SAM: Polymorph on myself?

03:01:52.786 --> 03:01:59.648
MATT: Okay. Because you are falling and this is a
lot of wind, I'm going to have to ask you to make

03:01:59.648 --> 03:02:02.090
a concentration check to complete the spell.

03:02:02.090 --> 03:02:03.847
LAURA: Come on, Scanlan!

03:02:03.847 --> 03:02:05.391
MATT: So go ahead and roll a d20.

03:02:05.391 --> 03:02:09.401
SAM: This is a concentration not on holding a
spell, but on casting it?

03:02:09.401 --> 03:02:13.375
MATT: Correct. Because as part of the
components of it and maintaining your attention to

03:02:13.375 --> 03:02:14.579
the spell--

03:02:14.579 --> 03:02:17.006
MARISHA: What does he add? His spell attack
bonus?

03:02:17.006 --> 03:02:24.859
MATT: This? No, this is a d20 and-- let me make
sure, yeah-- it's a d20 and then you add your plus

03:02:24.859 --> 03:02:28.481
five from your charisma.

03:02:28.481 --> 03:02:32.704
SAM: Charisma? That's a natural 20.

03:02:32.704 --> 03:02:34.565
(cheering)

03:02:34.565 --> 03:02:40.773
MATT: With that-- (screeches) pterodactyl.

03:02:40.773 --> 03:02:46.762
LIAM: Tables have turned, motherfucker! Tables
have turned!

03:02:46.762 --> 03:02:48.529
ORION: You're both flying cows!

03:02:48.529 --> 03:02:52.795
LAURA: Wait! Was Seeming a concentration?

03:02:52.795 --> 03:02:55.289
ORION: I think it lasts for like eight hours.

03:02:55.289 --> 03:02:57.363
LAURA: Did it drop? Are we no longer cows?

03:02:57.363 --> 03:03:00.060
SAM: I think so. I'll check.

03:03:00.060 --> 03:03:01.312
LIAM: Hey! You're not a cow anymore!

03:03:01.312 --> 03:03:02.901
LAURA: Oh my god, you're not a cow anymore!

03:03:02.901 --> 03:03:04.180
LIAM: Oh! Awesome!

03:03:04.180 --> 03:03:08.163
MATT: You guys keep flying. You guys catch yourselves.

03:03:08.163 --> 03:03:11.019
SAM: Nope, not concentration. It just lasts for
eight hours.

03:03:11.019 --> 03:03:16.156
MATT: You guys are all still flying cows. You're
all still just a squadron of flying, illusory

03:03:16.156 --> 03:03:24.631
cows, which you guys are both now transformed into
an eagle and a pterodactyl, but you still look

03:03:24.631 --> 03:03:25.575
like cows.

03:03:25.575 --> 03:03:27.508
(laughter)

03:03:27.508 --> 03:03:34.763
LIAM: As the twins are flying, I say, hey, did you
notice we have the same pattern? Twins!

03:03:34.763 --> 03:03:47.070
MATT: About this time, you hear a loud, impactful
boom. And there's a cloud of dust partway into

03:03:47.070 --> 03:03:51.895
the side of this first bit of mountain range that
you come upon, a little bit distant from you

03:03:51.895 --> 03:03:52.862
guys.

03:03:52.862 --> 03:03:54.189
LAURA: Can I fly down towards it?

03:03:54.189 --> 03:03:57.455
MATT: You start heading in that direction. Because
of the speed it was traveling at and the way it

03:03:57.455 --> 03:04:02.748
was carrying at the speed it was going, it's still
ahead of you guys. And you see the impact. You

03:04:02.748 --> 03:04:08.429
hear this loud screeching sound and you see now
where there was a little poof of cloud, these wings

03:04:08.429 --> 03:04:13.737
unfold and (flapping) make its way back up.

03:04:13.737 --> 03:04:15.829
ORION: How far away from it are we?

03:04:15.829 --> 03:04:21.485
MATT: You guys right now at the close to six
minutes you've been traveling--

03:04:21.485 --> 03:04:23.729
MARISHA: Did it not drop the cow to 0 hit points?

03:04:23.729 --> 03:04:27.697
MATT: All the damage carries over.

03:04:27.697 --> 03:04:32.842
LIAM: The remainder of that damage went into its
hit points.

03:04:32.842 --> 03:04:36.471
MATT: You don't know. It looks hurt. It looks like
it wasn't happy about it. It continues back up.

03:04:36.471 --> 03:04:41.809
From you Tiberius, it's probably close to 700 to
800 feet away from you. It's because of the speed

03:04:41.809 --> 03:04:45.015
it was traveling and the speed you guys were
following. It was gaining on you every single

03:04:45.015 --> 03:04:45.738
turn.

03:04:45.738 --> 03:04:46.874
LAURA: Is it flying away from us now?

03:04:46.874 --> 03:04:48.683
MATT: It's heading up into the mountain range.

03:04:48.683 --> 03:04:52.020
LIAM: Fly after that motherfucker!

03:04:52.020 --> 03:04:54.544
LAURA: Should we still track it? It's still
nighttime, right?

03:04:54.544 --> 03:04:56.061
MATT: It's still nighttime, yeah.

03:04:56.061 --> 03:04:57.692
ORION: It's only 500 feet away from me right now?

03:04:57.692 --> 03:04:59.074
MATT: 600 to 500 feet.

03:04:59.074 --> 03:05:00.793
ORION: Okay, cool. Well I'm going for it, still.

03:05:00.793 --> 03:05:02.183
MATT: What are you doing?

03:05:02.183 --> 03:05:03.668
LAURA: We're all following it.

03:05:03.668 --> 03:05:07.281
ORION: Where am I? It's taking off right now and
I'm over here?

03:05:07.281 --> 03:05:12.612
MATT: You're back here. It's now starting to take
off and head up towards the top of this mountain

03:05:12.612 --> 03:05:14.341
range that you're just starting to come upon.

03:05:14.341 --> 03:05:23.296
ORION: Okay. If it's doing that, then I'll fucking
go higher and try to meet it where it's going.

03:05:23.296 --> 03:05:31.797
MATT: Okay. Cool. The rest of you guys continue to
give chase. Now that it's returned to its form, it

03:05:31.797 --> 03:05:41.606
travels an additional double dash: 240 feet. As
this progresses, it's far beyond any of you guys

03:05:41.606 --> 03:05:42.635
in a matter of seconds.

03:05:42.635 --> 03:05:44.233
LAURA: Is the mountain range really far away?

03:05:44.233 --> 03:05:47.418
MATT: No, you've just hit the outskirts of the
mountain range. It got there first. You guys just

03:05:47.418 --> 03:05:51.117
catch up to where it starts and you see it's like
now it's dodging through the mountains and is

03:05:51.117 --> 03:05:55.640
currently no longer in sight. There is a little
bit of low cloud cover in this area. A couple

03:05:55.640 --> 03:05:59.963
drift by and cover a couple of the mountains. But
this little cluster of seaside cliffs and

03:05:59.963 --> 03:06:06.254
mountains, as you get closer, you can see it's
dotted with high altitude trees. There's

03:06:06.254 --> 03:06:09.812
precariously perched goats that are sleeping on
elements of the sides of this mountain.

03:06:09.812 --> 03:06:11.644
LIAM: Can you track it?

03:06:11.644 --> 03:06:13.975
LAURA: I can track it! Of course.

03:06:13.975 --> 03:06:15.766
MATT: So you're keeping your attention on it?

03:06:15.766 --> 03:06:16.938
LAURA: Yes.

03:06:16.938 --> 03:06:21.711
MATT: The winds also are pretty strong as you get
close to the mountains. As you coast around each,

03:06:21.711 --> 03:06:25.322
you start actually diving into this middle valley
area.

03:06:25.322 --> 03:06:27.253
LAURA: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on
all of us.

03:06:27.253 --> 03:06:28.668
MATT: Okay.

03:06:28.668 --> 03:06:30.729
SAM: Does that affect any spells?

03:06:30.729 --> 03:06:32.524
LAURA: No, it just makes us stealth easier.

03:06:32.524 --> 03:06:33.777
SAM: It doesn't drop Hunter's Mark?

03:06:33.777 --> 03:06:34.929
MATT: Is it concentration?

03:06:34.929 --> 03:06:38.513
LAURA: No, it's not concentration; it's an action.
Oh wait. (laughs) I don't know if I can tell.

03:06:38.513 --> 03:06:40.388
MATT: Is Pass Without a Trace concentration?

03:06:40.388 --> 03:06:41.963
LAURA: Where does it say it?

03:06:41.963 --> 03:06:44.333
SAM: There's a C next to it somewhere.

03:06:44.333 --> 03:06:51.423
LAURA: Oh, never mind! It's a concentration. Forget
it! I don't know how these things work yet.

03:06:51.423 --> 03:06:53.858
SAM: Yeah, stick to the bows and arrows.

03:06:53.858 --> 03:06:57.447
MATT: Traveling through this area, you can see the
mountains. The way that they're constructed in

03:06:57.447 --> 03:07:00.795
this area, it's not a gradual crag. A lot of these
are just punched up in the air, like whatever

03:07:00.795 --> 03:07:07.087
heavy seismic force that created these initially
was very localized and very powerful. A lot of the

03:07:07.087 --> 03:07:11.137
mountains are spire-like. They come up with very
sheer sides and you can see why this mountain

03:07:11.137 --> 03:07:17.740
range is largely not utilized or traversed or
generally spoken of often because it's too

03:07:17.740 --> 03:07:23.719
dangerous for most average folk to even attempt to
climb or use for any good reason. The winds are

03:07:23.719 --> 03:07:28.158
high and powerful here at the tops, as well. And
as you're flying around, the winds blowing across,

03:07:28.158 --> 03:07:32.538
and you get pushed off your course a little bit
here and there, but you still keep up, best as

03:07:32.538 --> 03:07:39.653
possible. You leading the charge. Over about five
minutes of searching through this mountain range,

03:07:39.653 --> 03:07:42.872
you sense that its movement eventually comes to
stop.

03:07:42.872 --> 03:07:44.536
LAURA: Okay.

03:07:44.536 --> 03:07:46.187
TRAVIS: There's a nest.

03:07:46.187 --> 03:07:48.872
SAM: Wait, you sense that he came to a stop?

03:07:48.872 --> 03:07:51.730
LAURA: He came to a stop a little bit ahead of
us.

03:07:51.730 --> 03:07:54.224
SAM: Let's go get him.

03:07:54.224 --> 03:07:57.140
LAURA: Can we all try to stealth in?

03:07:57.140 --> 03:08:00.175
SAM: I'm a pterodactyl, so--

03:08:00.175 --> 03:08:02.729
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go for the element of
surprise. Well, technically, we're all still

03:08:02.729 --> 03:08:03.967
cows.

03:08:03.967 --> 03:08:07.818
MATT: Yes. And you guys cannot talk because you're
actually in creature forms.

03:08:07.818 --> 03:08:14.009
LAURA: All right. Well, I'm going to try to
stealth. Mountains are my favored terrain!

03:08:14.009 --> 03:08:19.202
MATT: They are! Do you want to go onto the
mountain itself, or are you still flying amongst

03:08:19.202 --> 03:08:19.995
them?

03:08:19.995 --> 03:08:21.583
LAURA: Oh, I'll still fly.

03:08:21.583 --> 03:08:26.955
MATT: So you would not get the advantage because
air is not your favored terrain. So everyone who

03:08:26.955 --> 03:08:29.275
wishes to, go ahead and roll stealth checks

03:08:29.275 --> 03:08:30.573
MARISHA: All of us?

03:08:30.573 --> 03:08:33.416
MATT: All of you who wish to try and come at it
from a quiet--

03:08:33.416 --> 03:08:36.489
SAM: (pterodactyl screech)

03:08:36.489 --> 03:08:40.518
MATT: What did you roll?

03:08:40.518 --> 03:08:43.130
LIAM: With advantage, I rolled a two.

03:08:43.130 --> 03:08:45.103
MATT: Okay.

03:08:45.103 --> 03:08:47.884
LIAM: I'm not used to being flying, really.

03:08:47.884 --> 03:08:51.163
SAM: Five.

03:08:51.163 --> 03:08:53.202
ORION: Are we flying anymore?

03:08:53.202 --> 03:08:54.965
MATT: You guys are all still flying, yeah.

03:08:54.965 --> 03:08:58.488
ORION: Oh, shit. Okay. Oh, no.

03:08:58.488 --> 03:09:00.126
MARISHA: 21.

03:09:00.126 --> 03:09:01.300
TRAVIS: 14.

03:09:01.300 --> 03:09:02.559
LAURA: 28.

03:09:02.559 --> 03:09:09.988
MATT: Yeah, so. You guys following behind Vex, many
of you clumsily and some of you shouting out to

03:09:10.047 --> 03:09:17.191
each other, "I think she sees it this way." And
you're like, "oh my god." You come around this one

03:09:17.191 --> 03:09:21.805
bend and you can see one of the larger mountainous
spires that has a lot of trees and green growth

03:09:21.805 --> 03:09:26.606
towards the top at certain places where the rock
juts out and gives a shelf for such greenery to

03:09:26.606 --> 03:09:34.490
grow, outside of its sheer outside surface. You do
see a couple of wings fold in against the

03:09:34.490 --> 03:09:39.384
moonlight in what looks to be an outcropping. And
there are multiple layers of rock shelves on the

03:09:39.384 --> 03:09:43.030
side of this mountain. And on one of these
outcroppings, there appears to be some sort of a

03:09:43.030 --> 03:09:50.367
nest: a cluster of almost like actual trees and
pieces of wood that are all jammed into this giant

03:09:50.367 --> 03:09:55.997
nest that's nestled against where the shadow and
the moonlight are fighting for some sort of visual

03:09:55.997 --> 03:09:57.179
on it.

03:09:57.179 --> 03:09:58.589
TRAVIS: Big-ass tree fortress.

03:09:58.589 --> 03:10:01.427
LAURA: Did we just find like a mama bird and baby
birds?

03:10:01.427 --> 03:10:03.042
MARISHA: Yeah, we did.

03:10:03.042 --> 03:10:04.466
LAURA: What are we going to do?

03:10:04.466 --> 03:10:07.090
LIAM: We're going to take out the mom and train
the babies.

03:10:07.090 --> 03:10:11.832
SAM: What are we going to do?

03:10:11.832 --> 03:10:15.380
LIAM: Yeah. We're going to capture those babies
and we're going to train them.

03:10:15.380 --> 03:10:18.815
ORION: That's a good idea. I like that idea.

03:10:18.815 --> 03:10:20.056
SAM: Like Avatar?

03:10:20.056 --> 03:10:21.350
ORION: Yes.

03:10:21.350 --> 03:10:23.261
TRAVIS: You could go in.

03:10:23.261 --> 03:10:27.832
LAURA: Me go in? There's a giant fucking nest
here! I get close to it. As close as I feel safe

03:10:27.832 --> 03:10:29.039
getting to it.

03:10:29.039 --> 03:10:30.828
MATT: You guys all stay back or do you go with
her?

03:10:30.828 --> 03:10:34.887
ORION: I'm going to cast Greater Invisibility on
myself and then follow.

03:10:34.887 --> 03:10:38.628
MATT: Okay. You guys have 12 seconds before you
all plummet.

03:10:38.628 --> 03:10:42.464
ORION: Oh wait! No! I don't do that. Damn it! I
forget we're still flying.

03:10:42.464 --> 03:10:46.263
TRAVIS: What part of the flying part did you
forget?

03:10:46.263 --> 03:10:48.261
ORION: I thought we'd landed already.

03:10:48.261 --> 03:10:52.793
MATT: Are you guys all going with Vex, or are you
all staying back and she's going on her own?

03:10:52.793 --> 03:10:54.605
TRAVIS: Are we going to lose Fly, or do we keep
it?

03:10:54.605 --> 03:10:56.390
MATT: Are you casting Greater Invisibility?

03:10:56.390 --> 03:10:57.383
ORION: No.

03:10:57.383 --> 03:10:58.948
MATT: Then no, you're fine.

03:10:58.948 --> 03:11:01.959
LIAM: Is it the same stealth roll or an additional
stealth roll to go forward at this point?

03:11:01.959 --> 03:11:03.815
MATT: No this was your stealth roll on
approaching.

03:11:03.815 --> 03:11:06.290
LIAM: Oh. Well, I mean, I knew I rolled
shitty.

03:11:06.335 --> 03:11:07.773
MATT: You don't know you rolled shitty.

03:11:07.773 --> 03:11:09.263
TRAVIS: I'm going in.

03:11:09.263 --> 03:11:18.202
MATT: All right. So Vex and Grog, you approach.
Gliding cows, drifting through the night sky.

03:11:18.202 --> 03:11:20.174
LAURA: This is so stupid.

03:11:20.174 --> 03:11:21.597
TRAVIS: Hoof in hoof.

03:11:21.597 --> 03:11:27.879
MATT: Okay, yeah. So you guys all realize you must
keep close together to Tiberius as you come in.

03:11:27.879 --> 03:11:33.815
Keeping too much of a distance would be a bad
thing. You come upon the underneath portion of

03:11:33.815 --> 03:11:39.099
this outcropping, and you can see within a quick
glance-- go ahead and make a perception check, all

03:11:39.099 --> 03:11:40.082
of you guys.

03:11:40.082 --> 03:11:41.263
MARISHA: All of us?

03:11:41.263 --> 03:11:43.680
MATT: All of you who are coming up in this
cluster.

03:11:43.680 --> 03:11:44.919
TRAVIS: Three.

03:11:44.919 --> 03:11:48.934
LAURA: Do I get an advantage because we're in a
mountain environment at all?

03:11:48.934 --> 03:11:52.990
MATT: Nope. Actually no. Because you're seeing
things on a mountain, I will give you advantage on

03:11:52.990 --> 03:11:53.821
this.

03:11:53.821 --> 03:11:54.691
LAURA: Yes!

03:11:54.691 --> 03:11:57.047
MARISHA: 12.

03:11:57.047 --> 03:11:58.340
MATT: 12?

03:11:58.340 --> 03:11:59.694
ORION: 16.

03:11:59.694 --> 03:12:01.118
SAM: Nothing.

03:12:01.118 --> 03:12:02.194
LIAM: 13.

03:12:02.194 --> 03:12:04.141
LAURA: 12.

03:12:04.141 --> 03:12:06.306
MATT: So the highest was?

03:12:06.306 --> 03:12:07.433
ORION: 16.

03:12:07.433 --> 03:12:09.931
MATT: 16. You got?

03:12:09.931 --> 03:12:11.029
TRAVIS: Three.

03:12:11.029 --> 03:12:16.927
MATT: As you guys all look up, it's very shadowy
over here. It's hard to see. The moonlight's in

03:12:16.927 --> 03:12:20.871
your eye a little bit and the darkness is so
pitch. The umbra of this particular shadow is very

03:12:20.871 --> 03:12:29.116
dark and crushed. You make out, in the nest, the
large bird creature has folded its wings and is

03:12:29.116 --> 03:12:36.057
currently leaning down. And you see something
in the nest that's much smaller moving up next to it.

03:12:36.057 --> 03:12:39.728
MARISHA: I don't want to kill a mama.

03:12:39.728 --> 03:12:42.983
LAURA: But she's killing the farmers' stuff.

03:12:42.983 --> 03:12:46.513
MARISHA: Maybe we can transplant her.

03:12:46.513 --> 03:12:50.322
SAM: To a wildlife preserve?

03:12:50.322 --> 03:12:52.381
LAURA: Maybe. And her babies?

03:12:52.381 --> 03:12:55.790
MARISHA: Capture her and move her away from town?

03:12:55.790 --> 03:12:58.854
LIAM: That seems complicated.

03:12:58.854 --> 03:13:01.389
SAM: Are they on the highest peak?

03:13:01.389 --> 03:13:06.187
MATT: No. There's two other levels up above this.
This one just is one of the largest outcroppings.

03:13:06.187 --> 03:13:11.501
SAM: I'm going to swoop up over them. See if
there's any boulders to drop.

03:13:11.501 --> 03:13:21.561
MATT: Okay. Looking over it, there are no loose
rocks or boulders. In fact, because of the

03:13:21.561 --> 03:13:26.314
construction of these mountains, they're solid
spires that jut up and then abruptly end. All the

03:13:26.314 --> 03:13:29.435
erosion that happens here appears to be gradual
enough-- that's why the sides of the mountains are

03:13:29.435 --> 03:13:31.360
so smooth and unclimbable.

03:13:31.360 --> 03:13:36.751
MARISHA: So there's a sheer peak and they're
nested on the side of it?

03:13:36.751 --> 03:13:39.975
MATT: Yeah. It's a sheer peak that rounds off at
the very top and there are little outcroppings

03:13:39.975 --> 03:13:43.609
that jut out in places as it goes down. But those
are more towards the top, and as you go down

03:13:43.609 --> 03:13:48.599
further-- as most of the erosion hits the mountain
lower and lower, it has carved off or destroyed

03:13:48.599 --> 03:13:52.524
most of what would have been previous outcroppings,
or smoothed them over.

03:13:52.524 --> 03:13:54.579
TRAVIS: How far away are we now?

03:13:54.579 --> 03:14:00.975
MATT: You guys are probably a good 60 or 50 feet
if you're trying to get up within range of your

03:14:00.975 --> 03:14:05.116
Fly. Right? What's the range of on that? Fly?

03:14:05.116 --> 03:14:11.628
SAM: Fly? Oh, here.

03:14:11.628 --> 03:14:22.409
MATT: I got it. No! There is no range on it. You
just touch them. So you're fine. Yeah. As long as

03:14:22.409 --> 03:14:24.051
you're concentrating on it, you're fine.

03:14:24.051 --> 03:14:26.731
TRAVIS: So we're within 60 feet?

03:14:26.731 --> 03:14:31.789
MATT: Well, you guys have been keeping a little
more of a distance down here. However, at this

03:14:31.789 --> 03:14:38.445
point, as you guys are all encroaching and
Scanlan's gone overhead, a voice rings out against

03:14:38.445 --> 03:14:51.539
the darkness, "Flying cows? Really? I care not for
this insolence. If you've come to mock me or fight

03:14:51.539 --> 03:14:56.864
"me, do it now! Or leave this creature alone!"

03:14:56.864 --> 03:15:02.964
LAURA: What? Where are you? Who are you? Who said
that?

03:15:02.964 --> 03:15:08.889
ORION: I rolled an arcana check of 17 of my
surroundings-- where it's coming from.

03:15:08.889 --> 03:15:11.492
LAURA: Ditto. I try to perceive where it's coming
from.

03:15:11.492 --> 03:15:16.039
MATT: Okay. Arcana check-- there's nothing arcane
in nature. It's not omnipresent or coming from any

03:15:16.039 --> 03:15:19.282
certain place. There is a direction it's coming
from, which is from the outcropping or nest area.

03:15:19.282 --> 03:15:26.699
There's nothing arcane in nature to it. It's in
the shadow. You can't really see it from this

03:15:26.699 --> 03:15:27.800
distance.

03:15:27.800 --> 03:15:30.054
LAURA: Is it in front of us? To the side of us? Is
it coming from where the bird seems to be?

03:15:30.054 --> 03:15:31.655
MATT: It's coming from where the bird is.

03:15:31.655 --> 03:15:33.539
LIAM: He's controlling it.

03:15:33.539 --> 03:15:39.615
MARISHA: I fly over as an eagle.

03:15:39.615 --> 03:15:43.016
LAURA: You still look like a cow eagle.

03:15:43.016 --> 03:15:44.500
MARISHA: Can we drop Seeming?

03:15:44.500 --> 03:15:48.997
MATT: It's not under your control, and you can't
talk, too.

03:15:48.997 --> 03:15:54.745
TRAVIS: Okay. I yell out, you've been stealing the
farmers' livestock. Give us a reason not to kill

03:15:54.745 --> 03:15:55.539
you.

03:15:55.539 --> 03:15:58.637
SAM: That's good. That's good. Diplomacy.

03:15:58.637 --> 03:16:00.604
ORION: Or, I mean, moo!

03:16:00.604 --> 03:16:09.853
MATT: Okay. You guys are all keeping distance from
it? The voice comes out again, "Your nature

03:16:09.853 --> 03:16:16.473
"confuses me and your words seem ill-informed. If
you're not going to come to speak of discourse,

03:16:16.473 --> 03:16:19.426
"I'm going to assume that that you're my enemy."

03:16:19.426 --> 03:16:21.399
ORION: Then, as he's saying that, I'll approach.

03:16:21.399 --> 03:16:24.663
MATT: So Tiberius cow goes.

03:16:24.663 --> 03:16:30.234
ORION: And as I approach the thing, I'm going to
Dispel Magic on myself.

03:16:30.234 --> 03:16:39.195
MATT: Okay. Cool. For Dispel Magic, I need you to
go ahead, just for the sake of this-- I won't

03:16:39.195 --> 03:16:44.753
consider it contested because you're allies in
this thing. So you land. Tiberius' form shimmers

03:16:44.753 --> 03:16:50.509
and returns back to that of a dragonborn, and
you're standing there on the precipice. Go ahead

03:16:50.509 --> 03:16:52.699
and roll a perception check.

03:16:52.699 --> 03:16:55.391
ORION: What is that? 11.

03:16:55.391 --> 03:17:00.846
MATT: Okay. It's hard to make out the details, but
the voice is definitely coming from the nest. You

03:17:00.846 --> 03:17:07.004
see there is something vaguely humanoid, but it's
hard to make out the shape at this distance with

03:17:07.004 --> 03:17:16.080
this low light, especially since you aren't a
darkvision-gifted entity. However, it's close to

03:17:16.080 --> 03:17:17.654
this bird creature.

03:17:17.654 --> 03:17:23.287
ORION: I'm going to say, is this big bird thing
asleep?

03:17:23.287 --> 03:17:28.605
MATT: "You will not harm this creature,
poachers!"

03:17:28.605 --> 03:17:32.478
ORION: I'm not trying to harm it at all. I'm just
seeing if it's fine. If we could talk. I can't see

03:17:32.478 --> 03:17:36.602
anything, and I wanted to cast Light so I could
see something, but I don't want to hurt your

03:17:36.602 --> 03:17:37.822
bird's eyes.

03:17:37.822 --> 03:17:44.068
MATT: You can see the bird's moving and it's
looking towards your direction. And it has this

03:17:44.068 --> 03:17:46.105
like (soft snarl).

03:17:46.105 --> 03:17:47.694
ORION: So it's awake?

03:17:47.694 --> 03:17:54.926
MATT: It's awake, and it looks hurt. The voice is
like, "You come here masqueraded as whatever

03:17:54.926 --> 03:17:57.487
"manner of beasts that you are--"

03:17:57.487 --> 03:17:59.375
ORION: Cows. We were cows.

03:17:59.375 --> 03:18:05.107
MATT: "After tormenting and severely wounding this
beautiful creature."

03:18:05.107 --> 03:18:12.308
ORION: We didn't do anything to the creature. No,
we were-- This creature was stealing the farmer's

03:18:12.308 --> 03:18:17.562
cows, and the farmers were saying, "You've taken
our livestock," which is hurting the farm. We came

03:18:17.562 --> 03:18:20.792
to help them and we posed as cows, and then your
bird took our--

03:18:20.792 --> 03:18:23.880
LIAM: While he's blithering, can I make an
additional cow stealth check?

03:18:23.880 --> 03:18:25.456
MATT: To?

03:18:25.456 --> 03:18:31.502
LIAM: To come up behind the guy. Near him. Not
even near him. Just to get a better vantage point.

03:18:31.502 --> 03:18:34.160
MATT: Go for it. Make it with a disadvantage.

03:18:34.160 --> 03:18:37.496
LIAM: Does that cancel out with my advantage from
my cloak?

03:18:37.496 --> 03:18:39.583
LAURA: A cow in a cloak.

03:18:39.583 --> 03:18:44.406
MATT: You are a flying cow in the moonlight
against an individual that is very aware of your

03:18:44.406 --> 03:18:45.356
presence.

03:18:45.356 --> 03:18:46.938
LIAM: Shut up, baby, I know it.

03:18:46.938 --> 03:18:48.352
(laughter)

03:18:48.352 --> 03:18:50.793
LIAM: That is good.

03:18:50.793 --> 03:18:57.181
LAURA: That's 31.

03:18:57.181 --> 03:18:58.637
LIAM: Yeah. 31.

03:18:58.637 --> 03:19:08.289
MATT: (chuckles) You stealthily cow your way up to
the side of this precipice. Seemingly unnoticed.

03:19:08.289 --> 03:19:19.031
Getting a view of this creature now, you can see this
nest is a cluster of driftwood and chunks of

03:19:19.031 --> 03:19:25.031
shipwreck and carts and wagon wheels and whatever
pieces of wood have been scavenged from different

03:19:25.031 --> 03:19:30.561
time periods. Some are weathered, some are more
fresh. And trees, whole trees that are broken and

03:19:30.561 --> 03:19:38.638
shredded have all been cobbled together to make
this nest. In the center of this-- I'm going to

03:19:38.638 --> 03:19:45.814
take the intensity down on this a little bit-- you
see, there up against this bird-- and the bird

03:19:45.814 --> 03:19:52.703
itself is twitching and looks like it's hurt. Not
deeply hurt, but hurt. You see a small humanoid.

03:19:52.703 --> 03:19:59.446
Pretty small. Scanlan small. Hard to make out
details, but it is currently in the process of

03:19:59.446 --> 03:20:06.607
doing a repeated hand motion and then touching. A
hand motion and then touching. And you've seen

03:20:06.607 --> 03:20:08.450
this motion before.

03:20:08.450 --> 03:20:09.588
LIAM: Touching what?

03:20:09.588 --> 03:20:16.000
MATT: Touching the bird. There is a perpetual
string of Cure Wounds being applied to this bird.

03:20:16.000 --> 03:20:22.254
MARISHA: I also approach and come out of my eagle
form.

03:20:22.254 --> 03:20:23.419
ORION: Light.

03:20:23.419 --> 03:20:24.870
SAM: Are you landing somewhere?

03:20:24.870 --> 03:20:26.138
MARISHA: Next to Tiberius.

03:20:26.138 --> 03:20:30.958
ORION: But I'm going to block it with my hand so
it's not going to blind the bird.

03:20:30.958 --> 03:20:36.971
MATT: Okay. &nbsp;As the light picks up, you can see
the bird turns away for a second and starts to

03:20:36.971 --> 03:20:44.924
like flap its wings instinctually. And once again,
seeing it up close, this bird is really big. The

03:20:44.924 --> 03:20:55.052
humanoid entity becomes immediately visible. And
it is a gnome. You can see, he's dressed in hides

03:20:55.052 --> 03:21:00.198
and roughly crafted leather and furs. He has
tousled, greasy black hair that hangs past his

03:21:00.198 --> 03:21:09.329
shoulders, covering a bedraggled and bearded face.
Holding up his arm-- and looks thin. It's covering

03:21:09.329 --> 03:21:11.701
the light and he's like, "You!"

03:21:11.701 --> 03:21:18.776
ORION: Sorry. I tried to not blind you. It was
very dark. I'm sorry. Hello. We mean you no harm.

03:21:18.776 --> 03:21:27.742
MATT: The gnome slams this small wooden, for lack
of a better term, a small staff or cane. Slams it

03:21:27.742 --> 03:21:33.943
into the ground with a foot stomp and you can see
the gnome's entire body suddenly begin to shift

03:21:33.943 --> 03:21:37.727
and change into this dark, gnarled-looking, hard
surface.

03:21:37.727 --> 03:21:40.422
LIAM: I whack him in the back of the head.

03:21:40.422 --> 03:21:43.022
LAURA: No! It's just Barkskin! It's just defense!

03:21:43.022 --> 03:21:50.201
MATT: He doesn't know. All right. So you cow
stealth up to the side of this guy.

03:21:50.201 --> 03:21:52.051
LIAM: Let's get ready to rumble.

03:21:52.051 --> 03:21:55.919
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make an attack.

03:21:55.919 --> 03:21:57.583
LIAM: I pause.

03:21:57.583 --> 03:22:09.023
MATT: You pause? You are currently now crouched
right behind the edge of this nest, and you can't

03:22:09.023 --> 03:22:14.426
even actually see the guy anymore because in order
to get up there, you've come underneath to stay

03:22:14.426 --> 03:22:16.186
hidden and you're just there behind.

03:22:16.186 --> 03:22:17.629
MARISHA: Can I see Vax?

03:22:17.629 --> 03:22:23.594
MATT: No. Well, actually go ahead and roll a
perception check. Is it higher than a 31?

03:22:23.594 --> 03:22:29.201
MARISHA: Is it higher than a 31? No.

03:22:29.201 --> 03:22:31.243
MATT: You have no idea where Vax is.

03:22:31.243 --> 03:22:34.469
SAM: I'm way up above them still, right? Do I see
anything?

03:22:34.469 --> 03:22:39.893
MATT: No, actually. You see, there's another
section above there. It looks like there's nothing

03:22:39.893 --> 03:22:43.372
else of interest, other than some growth, a few
bushes, and some vines that hang down the side.

03:22:43.372 --> 03:22:46.333
TRAVIS: Somebody talk to him before I kill this
fucking bird.

03:22:46.333 --> 03:22:49.213
ORION: I am talking to him.

03:22:49.213 --> 03:22:55.516
MARISHA: I land beside Tiberius and come out of
eagle form. Tiberius, would you please Dispel this

03:22:55.516 --> 03:23:02.906
cow form from me. Please? Thank you.

03:23:02.906 --> 03:23:09.245
MATT: Okay. And with that, you cast Dispel Magic
and Keyleth's form reverts that to Keyleth. Normal

03:23:09.245 --> 03:23:13.946
Keyleth. Non-cow Keyleth. The gnome character now
has the staff at the back and has a hand in front

03:23:13.946 --> 03:23:15.728
and is like, (panting).

03:23:15.728 --> 03:23:24.793
MARISHA: Are you a druid? I'm also a druid. I
think our goals might be aligned.

03:23:24.793 --> 03:23:26.789
MATT: "Really?"

03:23:26.789 --> 03:23:32.641
MARISHA: It's okay. What's her name?

03:23:32.641 --> 03:23:45.861
MATT: "This creature has no name to it yet. I,
myself, am a protector of the wild, as you claim

03:23:45.861 --> 03:23:53.203
"to be, as well. I have no tribe but the trees
around me. I hear the whisper of the wind, and it

03:23:53.203 --> 03:23:54.715
"calls for justice."

03:23:54.715 --> 03:23:59.015
MARISHA: I can relate to that.

03:23:59.015 --> 03:24:04.919
MATT: "Then why do you follow? Why do you insist
on harming this creature?"

03:24:04.919 --> 03:24:09.147
MARISHA: Because we were seeking justice for other
people.

03:24:09.147 --> 03:24:14.505
MATT: "Why? For the civilized folk of the city?
You should know more than most. They sit there,

03:24:14.505 --> 03:24:20.889
"taking beautiful creatures of nature, making them
fat and formless and worth nothing. To

03:24:20.889 --> 03:24:24.496
"slaughter them without life and purpose to their
existence."

03:24:24.496 --> 03:24:27.949
ORION: The life and purpose of their existence is
to keep those other people alive.

03:24:27.949 --> 03:24:33.629
MATT: "And why is it not the same with this
creature? If they cannot guard their livestock,

03:24:33.629 --> 03:24:38.667
"why is it not food for this thing, as well? It is
the natural life cycle that they've removed

03:24:38.667 --> 03:24:40.093
"themselves from."

03:24:40.093 --> 03:24:44.397
ORION: When one has an establishment, when one
grows its own crop, and one steals something, it

03:24:44.397 --> 03:24:45.878
is considered a crime.

03:24:45.878 --> 03:24:49.863
MATT: "Well, when one is not part of that
civilization, but the civilization of the world as

03:24:49.863 --> 03:24:56.787
"a whole, which requires hunting for what keeps you
alive, perhaps that does not sink or hang on my

03:24:56.787 --> 03:24:57.773
"conscience."

03:24:57.773 --> 03:24:59.022
ORION: Fair point.

03:24:59.022 --> 03:25:05.991
MARISHA: Let's not let this escalate. Okay? What
is your name?

03:25:05.991 --> 03:25:08.908
MATT: "I was once called Byron."

03:25:08.908 --> 03:25:10.370
MARISHA: Vyron?

03:25:10.370 --> 03:25:11.275
MATT: "Byron."

03:25:11.275 --> 03:25:12.265
MARISHA: Byron.

03:25:12.265 --> 03:25:16.486
MATT: "I have not heard my name nor spoken words
for many years."

03:25:16.486 --> 03:25:21.326
ORION: Would you not like to be called Byron, or
would you like something else, like B-roy or

03:25:21.326 --> 03:25:31.902
B-man? My name's Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia.
And this is my friend Keyleth, who is also a

03:25:31.902 --> 03:25:35.822
druid. And we also have a friend who is a gnome
who sings songs and whatnot.

03:25:35.822 --> 03:25:43.540
MATT: The bird, now looking of much better health
than it was when it arrived, now flutters its

03:25:43.540 --> 03:25:49.181
wings out in a stretching motion. And as it does,
its head glides down and looks right towards you.

03:25:49.181 --> 03:25:52.555
This giant beak that looks like it could snap you
in two with a single bite.

03:25:52.555 --> 03:26:00.648
MARISHA: I reach up to it and reach out to pet its
beak.

03:26:00.648 --> 03:26:07.154
MATT: I'm going to ask you to make an animal
handling check on this. Just to see where this

03:26:07.154 --> 03:26:08.085
goes.

03:26:08.085 --> 03:26:11.926
MARISHA: Okay.

03:26:11.926 --> 03:26:16.410
SAM: I gently start swooping down to check on my
friends.

03:26:16.410 --> 03:26:19.459
MARISHA: 19.

03:26:19.459 --> 03:26:34.550
MATT: All right. The large bird-type creature
retracts from your attempted touch and begins to

03:26:34.550 --> 03:26:39.804
rear back into the nest in a defensive position.
Doesn't bite your hand off.

03:26:39.804 --> 03:26:54.522
MARISHA: I kneel down a bit. Produce a few
Goodberries. Reach out.

03:26:54.522 --> 03:27:07.799
SAM: Bye, Keyleth. This is how we lose one of our
members. Feeding a bird.

03:27:07.799 --> 03:27:13.186
MATT: The creature leans forward and the
giant bird, you can see its dark, black eyes

03:27:13.186 --> 03:27:20.587
staring at you. Each eye probably about the size
of your torso. As the giant beak comes down, you

03:27:20.587 --> 03:27:32.820
can see the moonlight gliding off the smooth
exterior of the dark black beak. It smells. And

03:27:32.820 --> 03:27:43.476
you take 27 points of piercing damage as the
animal takes the Goodberries and almost your

03:27:43.476 --> 03:27:47.795
entire hand with it, as well. At that size, it's
hard to be gentle.

03:27:47.795 --> 03:27:50.844
MARISHA: It's okay. It's all right.

03:27:50.844 --> 03:27:57.151
MATT: So you retract your hand, which is now
essentially in many ways, bones are broken, feels

03:27:57.151 --> 03:28:02.464
like. There's blood streaming down the side of
your hand, and (dripping).

03:28:02.464 --> 03:28:04.584
MARISHA: That's a good girl.

03:28:04.584 --> 03:28:07.321
SAM: Is it?

03:28:07.321 --> 03:28:08.522
MATT: Swallows.

03:28:08.522 --> 03:28:09.967
SAM: Is it a good girl?

03:28:09.967 --> 03:28:11.605
ORION: I'm feeding a tiny snack to Lockheed.

03:28:11.605 --> 03:28:15.157
MARISHA: I turn back to Byron--

03:28:15.157 --> 03:28:17.974
SAM: And say, ow.

03:28:17.974 --> 03:28:38.186
MARISHA: Yeah, and go, that hurt. Now. Please
listen to me. Please, please listen to me. We did

03:28:38.186 --> 03:28:40.709
come here to kill the giant creature.

03:28:40.709 --> 03:28:42.964
MATT: "I had assumed."

03:28:42.964 --> 03:28:52.403
MARISHA: But upon seeing the situation, upon
approach, realized the situation and decided

03:28:52.403 --> 03:28:59.131
amongst all of us that we did not want to bring
such a great creature to its death.

03:28:59.131 --> 03:29:05.864
MATT: Scanlan, you've landed by now. A
pterodactyl. A cow-looking pterodactyl.

03:29:05.864 --> 03:29:09.456
ORION: As he swoops, I've never seen anything
quite like it.

03:29:09.456 --> 03:29:11.059
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:29:11.059 --> 03:29:13.119
ORION: I'm going to aid her, too.

03:29:13.119 --> 03:29:16.751
SAM: All I've seen so far is Keyleth's bloody
hand.

03:29:16.751 --> 03:29:18.391
MARISHA: 20 total.

03:29:18.391 --> 03:29:22.560
MATT: You have advantage on this because Tiberius
is aiding you on this conversation.

03:29:22.560 --> 03:29:24.569
MARISHA: I'll take that 20 total.

03:29:24.569 --> 03:29:38.745
MATT: All right. He looks at you. "Well, shall you
leave us, then?"

03:29:38.745 --> 03:29:41.647
MARISHA: Under one condition.

03:29:41.647 --> 03:29:48.052
MATT: "There's always a condition. You call
yourself a druid, yet you speak like the civilized

03:29:48.052 --> 03:29:54.054
"folk. I get the feeling that perhaps your
connection to nature has not been tended to for

03:29:54.054 --> 03:29:55.174
"some time."

03:29:55.174 --> 03:29:59.140
ORION: No, she really knows her stuff. I mean, we
just fought this fire guy--

03:29:59.140 --> 03:30:07.232
MARISHA: Just because one can appreciate nature,
does not mean that one cannot also appreciate

03:30:07.232 --> 03:30:08.480
humanity.

03:30:08.480 --> 03:30:18.817
MATT: "Well, this beautiful creature is the only
surviving young of a clutch, bred by a majestic

03:30:18.878 --> 03:30:27.103
"roc high in the Cliffkeep Mountains. Its mother
now lies dead, slain by the brutal giants that

03:30:27.103 --> 03:30:36.434
"wander those peaks. This young'un is all that
remains of that clutch and the memory of that

03:30:36.434 --> 03:30:37.637
"blessed entity."

03:30:37.637 --> 03:30:39.145
TRAVIS: That's a young'un?

03:30:39.145 --> 03:30:47.752
MATT: This is a young one. "This new home serves
us well. Abundance of feed. Lack of large,

03:30:47.752 --> 03:30:51.834
"predatory creatures. I believe this is where we'll
stay."

03:30:51.834 --> 03:31:00.564
MARISHA: Question. If this is a young, adolescent
creature, what do you think of the destruction it

03:31:00.564 --> 03:31:07.570
could cause once it reaches full adulthood? Are
you okay with having that on your conscience? This

03:31:07.570 --> 03:31:18.980
creature could result in the lives of many. If you
relocate out of town, just a few miles. Say like

03:31:18.980 --> 03:31:24.260
50 or 100 or so because this thing's really damn
big. So I'm sure it's got a pretty big-- you know

03:31:24.260 --> 03:31:25.669
what I mean.

03:31:25.669 --> 03:31:27.335
ORION: Or just the other way.

03:31:27.335 --> 03:31:33.167
MARISHA: I will help you. I will personally come
with you and tend to their safety. And make sure

03:31:33.167 --> 03:31:41.747
that their location is proper and safe, and
handled with respect. Then you will be out of the

03:31:41.747 --> 03:31:47.477
harms of poachers. You can live off the land, and
you can be free and alone.

03:31:47.477 --> 03:31:53.770
MATT: "Do you think we came straight to this
mountain range? Do you think this is the first

03:31:53.770 --> 03:32:04.462
"nest we've constructed? Me and this lone survivor
have scoured the length of this side of Tal'Dorei.

03:32:04.462 --> 03:32:12.726
"This, as far as I can see, is the safest. It's the
most ignored by nearby civilization."

03:32:12.726 --> 03:32:14.562
MARISHA: Listen--

03:32:14.562 --> 03:32:22.049
SAM: I'm going to drop Seeming and also drop my
form of pterodactyl.

03:32:22.049 --> 03:32:28.055
MATT: All of you now, your forms change. As this
happens mid-sentence, it's noticed immediately by

03:32:28.055 --> 03:32:30.686
the gnome druid, who's like (gasps).

03:32:30.686 --> 03:32:39.896
MARISHA: Yes! That is correct. Listen. We are
being nice. Don't think that we will be the first.

03:32:39.896 --> 03:32:49.189
You will have more people come and hunt you and
kill this, as this beast continues. How long do

03:32:49.189 --> 03:32:56.308
you think you can survive waves of mercenaries
coming to try and kill this? We are the nice ones.

03:32:56.308 --> 03:33:04.734
I suggest you heed our warning, take our help, and
save the life of you and your creature in the long

03:33:04.734 --> 03:33:05.817
run.

03:33:05.817 --> 03:33:11.076
MATT: "You have yet to provide a suitable
alternative."

03:33:11.076 --> 03:33:12.754
ORION: Oh! I might have an idea.

03:33:12.754 --> 03:33:17.928
MARISHA: There is an alternative. Tiberius can
tell you of that alternative.

03:33:17.928 --> 03:33:23.120
ORION: Yes! See, your creature is rather large and
powerful, yes? You have a rather strong bond with

03:33:23.120 --> 03:33:26.490
him, which is quite unique with such a unique
looking creature.

03:33:26.490 --> 03:33:29.601
MARISHA: I was setting you up for an awesome
one-liner, man! You were supposed to be like, the

03:33:29.601 --> 03:33:31.327
other option is death.

03:33:31.327 --> 03:33:34.391
LIAM: Ask him if he's considered Whitestone?

03:33:34.391 --> 03:33:46.362
ORION: Whitestone? Yeah! Well, I guess there's a
couple of options, really. There's this town

03:33:46.362 --> 03:33:50.958
Whitestone that's pretty great and has a lot of
livestock that this creature can consume.

03:33:50.958 --> 03:33:52.874
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't know about that.

03:33:52.874 --> 03:33:55.310
MATT: Go ahead and make a deception check.

03:33:55.310 --> 03:34:01.416
ORION: That is a 24.

03:34:01.416 --> 03:34:08.089
MATT: "Whitestone. How far is this Whitestone?"

03:34:08.089 --> 03:34:15.226
MARISHA: Wait! No! Hang on! No! This is getting
out of control already. I will not let you all do

03:34:15.226 --> 03:34:21.520
this! No! Not today. You guys have caused enough
problems. We are not going to push this creature

03:34:21.520 --> 03:34:27.888
on other people. I'm trying, all right? I'm
working on it. I don't want to push this problem

03:34:27.888 --> 03:34:34.210
off on a town that's already being held hostage by
vampires. That fucking sucks! That's double

03:34:34.210 --> 03:34:35.568
shitting on them.

03:34:35.568 --> 03:34:41.369
ORION: Well, the other option was, like I was
saying, perhaps you can form an agreement with

03:34:41.369 --> 03:34:48.477
Emon. I'm sure it would pay in livestock rather
well for the protection of you, such a powerful

03:34:48.477 --> 03:34:53.478
druid, over at least a section of the land. In
exchange for free food for your friend.

03:34:53.478 --> 03:35:08.824
MATT: "You, dragon man, are adorably naive of the
ways of men and those that lie and deceive. I have

03:35:08.824 --> 03:35:19.446
"yet to have met any civilized people who have kept
their word when it came to creatures like this."

03:35:19.446 --> 03:35:28.932
LAURA: Can I come forward? All right. What about
Vasselheim? Not in the city, but outside of it.

03:35:28.932 --> 03:35:32.278
There's plentiful forests, tons of giant creatures
it could feed on.

03:35:32.278 --> 03:35:34.648
ORION: That's right! That's true!

03:35:34.648 --> 03:35:36.466
MARISHA: That actually is fairly true.

03:35:36.466 --> 03:35:42.304
LAURA: There's so many monsters out there, they
don't hunt them all because there's too many.

03:35:42.304 --> 03:35:45.899
ORION: That's a wonderful idea, Vex. Yes!

03:35:45.899 --> 03:35:49.027
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:35:49.027 --> 03:35:51.358
ORION: I'll aid her, as well.

03:35:51.358 --> 03:35:57.855
MATT: I'll say you've aided one person recently.
This'll just be her check on this. He really

03:35:57.855 --> 03:35:59.574
doesn't trust you, given the current
circumstances.

03:35:59.574 --> 03:36:01.992
LAURA: 21.

03:36:01.992 --> 03:36:03.748
MATT: Natural 20.

03:36:03.748 --> 03:36:17.755
LAURA: Then as a natural 20, you know that's good
for you. That's the best place you can go. You can

03:36:17.755 --> 03:36:20.489
see the wisdom in my persuasion.

03:36:20.489 --> 03:36:24.297
ORION: It is true, though. I mean, it's just feed
walking all around for it.

03:36:24.297 --> 03:36:28.523
MARISHA: Please, please listen to us. We're only
trying to help.

03:36:28.523 --> 03:36:34.987
SAM: Is there a young creature around here besides
the--

03:36:34.987 --> 03:36:37.681
MATT: No, looking about you, no.

03:36:37.681 --> 03:36:40.020
SAM: There's no babies there?

03:36:40.020 --> 03:36:43.291
MATT: No. This is the young. This bird is like the
adolescent.

03:36:43.291 --> 03:36:48.054
MARISHA: Please believe me. I let this thing
almost take my hand off, and I'm still standing

03:36:48.054 --> 03:36:55.339
here fairly cogently talking to you, so please
take that as a sign of honesty.

03:36:55.339 --> 03:37:00.664
LAURA: I go and put my hand on her back and cast
Cure Wounds, because I got that spell now, yo!

03:37:00.664 --> 03:37:05.307
SAM: Where are we telling them to go?

03:37:05.307 --> 03:37:06.701
TRAVIS: To Vasselheim.

03:37:06.701 --> 03:37:07.999
SAM: Vasselheim?

03:37:07.999 --> 03:37:14.942
MARISHA: Listen. She's right. We have friends in
Vasselheim. We can contact the Slayer's Take.

03:37:14.942 --> 03:37:21.327
We're a part of their guild. We can tell them that
you're coming. They'll not bother you. We can tell

03:37:21.327 --> 03:37:25.454
them they are not allowed to take out a contract
on your creature. You will not be harmed.

03:37:25.454 --> 03:37:28.178
LAURA: Don't bring up contracts, Keyleth. Maybe
just don't even bring it up.

03:37:28.178 --> 03:37:33.076
MARISHA: Because they don't have mercenaries out
there. It has to be approved! So it's really

03:37:33.076 --> 03:37:34.155
good.

03:37:34.155 --> 03:37:40.016
MATT: "And what's to stop them from hunting down a
majestic creature as rare as this one?"

03:37:40.016 --> 03:37:42.221
ORION: Us!

03:37:42.221 --> 03:37:43.822
MATT: "You, who live here in Emon?"

03:37:43.822 --> 03:37:46.333
ORION: Yes. No, us who are members of the guild.

03:37:46.333 --> 03:37:50.732
MATT: "So you also are monster slayers, who come
here under the guise to slay this monster?"

03:37:50.732 --> 03:37:54.641
ORION: No! Not here. Other places that we're
forced to do it. But still we're members.

03:37:54.641 --> 03:37:57.204
MATT: "It's too much talk."

03:37:57.204 --> 03:38:01.917
TRAVIS: Can we kill this thing now? You guys are
doing awesome.

03:38:01.917 --> 03:38:10.431
MARISHA: I feel like I've done pretty damn good!
Come on, man!

03:38:10.431 --> 03:38:19.967
SAM: I start speaking in Gnome to him. Listen.
Earlier, you said that this place was perfect. It

03:38:19.967 --> 03:38:24.982
was safe. There were no large predators. Well,
you're looking at six large predators. We'll keep

03:38:24.982 --> 03:38:29.882
hunting you down and hunting your beast down until
you get out of here. This is your one and only

03:38:29.882 --> 03:38:35.255
warning. You must leave, and you must leave now.
We're giving you a good choice, a safe choice. We

03:38:35.255 --> 03:38:41.344
can help you get there and be safe there. But if
you don't listen to us, we'll start killing.

03:38:41.344 --> 03:38:45.433
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

03:38:45.433 --> 03:38:48.348
MARISHA: How many fucking persuasion rolls does
this asshole need?

03:38:48.348 --> 03:38:51.447
SAM: Persuasion?

03:38:51.447 --> 03:38:58.258
MATT: This is essentially a conversational skill
challenge. So every success and failure leads

03:38:58.258 --> 03:39:00.518
towards where the conversation's going to end.

03:39:00.518 --> 03:39:02.270
SAM: 32.

03:39:02.270 --> 03:39:13.316
MATT: He gives you a look. Very intense, looking
into your very essence-type stare. His little

03:39:13.316 --> 03:39:28.606
beady gnomish eyes meeting yours. (sighs) "If
we're going to make this journey to where you say

03:39:28.606 --> 03:39:31.259
"this Vasselheim is, how far is it?"

03:39:31.259 --> 03:39:33.106
SAM: Several days' journey.

03:39:33.106 --> 03:39:36.093
LAURA: It's just across the water. You could fly
no problem over it.

03:39:36.093 --> 03:39:37.571
MATT: "Across the sea?"

03:39:37.571 --> 03:39:43.115
TRAVIS: It's across the sea.

03:39:43.115 --> 03:39:49.644
SAM: We can draw you a map. We can give you
provisions. We'll even make sure the farmers

03:39:49.644 --> 03:39:58.604
provide you with a few pieces of livestock to chow
down on before the journey. A parting gift to fuel

03:39:58.604 --> 03:40:07.110
up before the big ride. We can give you papers to
hand to the Slayer's Take that will ensure that

03:40:07.110 --> 03:40:09.119
you'll be treated fairly.

03:40:09.119 --> 03:40:14.707
ORION: I'll take out my Scroll of Telescription
and start writing a note.

03:40:14.707 --> 03:40:21.868
MATT: He looks back towards Keyleth, looks back at
Scanlan, looks back at Keyleth, looks up at the

03:40:21.868 --> 03:40:23.052
bird.

03:40:23.052 --> 03:40:28.164
MARISHA: Please. We really don't need another
death on our conscience today.

03:40:28.164 --> 03:40:41.099
MATT: "Then looks like we don't have much of a
choice, do we? If you can assure us enough food to

03:40:41.099 --> 03:40:49.774
"get across on this journey, we'll make our way
towards this Vasselheim. I pray on the solidarity

03:40:49.774 --> 03:40:58.954
"between our kin, and our kin, that you speak the
truth that resonates this moment. Because if it

03:40:58.954 --> 03:41:03.967
"does not, may the fall of this entity and myself
weigh on your conscience."

03:41:03.967 --> 03:41:09.015
ORION: I flip over the note that I'm writing to
him and then I trigger it (flying noise) as he's

03:41:09.015 --> 03:41:10.419
reading it.

03:41:10.419 --> 03:41:24.103
MATT: All right. It (poof) vanishes. "As the sun
rises, two sizable pieces of livestock to be

03:41:24.103 --> 03:41:31.160
"placed at the boundaries of the usual hunting
site. If those are there, and it is taken without

03:41:31.160 --> 03:41:39.004
"any sort of aggression, we'll take that as a sign
that you are being honest, and we shan't bother

03:41:39.004 --> 03:41:41.098
"you or your people any further."

03:41:41.098 --> 03:41:44.939
SAM: I bow deeply and when I do, it goes (cowbell
ringing).

03:41:44.939 --> 03:41:55.426
MATT: For a moment, you think you hear a slight,
uncontrollable chuckle from the gnome.

03:41:55.426 --> 03:42:05.786
ORION: As that's going on, because we're going to
head back right now to seal this up, right? Then

03:42:05.786 --> 03:42:13.292
I'll do my Teleportation Circle. Which is closer
to the northeast: the Lyceum or the Keep?

03:42:13.292 --> 03:42:17.493
MATT: To the north side of it? That would be the
Lyceum.

03:42:17.493 --> 03:42:20.304
LAURA: We could fly back pretty fast. Couldn't
we?

03:42:20.304 --> 03:42:22.295
MATT: If he has another Fly spell, you could take
it right back.

03:42:22.295 --> 03:42:24.002
LAURA: Yeah, we can just fly back.

03:42:24.002 --> 03:42:30.492
MARISHA: Before he leaves. Well, wait! We've got
to go to the farm.

03:42:30.492 --> 03:42:33.953
SAM: We've got to go to the farmers. We've got to
buy some cows off them.

03:42:33.953 --> 03:42:42.857
MARISHA: And I tell him, if you're up that way,
there's a druidic tribe, a little village called

03:42:42.857 --> 03:42:51.542
Pyrah. They're Fire Ashari. You can find their
headmaster Cerkonos. He's a friend. You might find

03:42:51.542 --> 03:42:55.234
your people there. Who knows? Maybe friends will
do you good.

03:42:55.234 --> 03:43:02.734
MATT: "Ashari, you say? My dealings with them have
been mixed. Perhaps I'll keep my distance."

03:43:02.734 --> 03:43:10.288
LAURA: Can I see if there's any feathers dropped
from the giant bird creature?

03:43:10.288 --> 03:43:12.017
MATT: There are ample around.

03:43:12.017 --> 03:43:13.989
LAURA: Can I grab a few of them?

03:43:13.989 --> 03:43:17.526
MATT: As you go and reach up, slaps you across the
knuckles.

03:43:17.526 --> 03:43:20.950
LAURA: Can I have a feather that he dropped?

03:43:20.950 --> 03:43:22.367
MATT: "Why?"

03:43:22.367 --> 03:43:27.637
LAURA: Because they're beautiful. You have to
admit they're beautiful.

03:43:27.637 --> 03:43:33.965
MATT: (sighs) "Elves. All right."

03:43:33.965 --> 03:43:35.601
LAURA: Thank you.

03:43:35.601 --> 03:43:39.841
MATT: You take three roc feathers.

03:43:39.841 --> 03:43:42.432
TRAVIS: They're huge, right?

03:43:42.432 --> 03:43:45.554
MATT: Yeah. They're almost boat size.

03:43:45.554 --> 03:43:48.064
ORION: I put one in my Bag of Holding, too.

03:43:48.064 --> 03:43:57.260
MATT: You guys manage to get one for you and three
for you guys before he's like, "Now go! Now! My

03:43:57.260 --> 03:44:03.622
"patience wears thin. I'm through with talking
words." (sighs)

03:44:03.622 --> 03:44:05.220
SAM: Sorry.

03:44:05.220 --> 03:44:07.922
LIAM: I walk out from behind him and just walk past.

03:44:07.922 --> 03:44:09.801
MATT: (yelps)

03:44:09.801 --> 03:44:12.151
SAM: (laughs) Sorry about that.

03:44:12.151 --> 03:44:15.759
ORION: All right. I'll burn another 5th-level and
then fly us all out.

03:44:15.759 --> 03:44:28.593
MATT: Okay. You guys coast back to the north side
of Emon. You go to the door where the Klaus family

03:44:28.593 --> 03:44:35.387
is, and you speak with them for a while. You
manage to convince them of the situation and what

03:44:35.387 --> 03:44:40.120
seems to be a mutually positive circumstance. They
agree it's better to lose two cows than continue

03:44:40.120 --> 03:44:41.205
this.

03:44:41.205 --> 03:44:43.593
LAURA: I pay them for their two cows. Being nice,
man!

03:44:43.593 --> 03:44:45.167
MATT: How much do you give them?

03:44:45.167 --> 03:44:48.839
LAURA: How much are cows usually worth?

03:44:48.839 --> 03:44:50.636
MATT: You've never purchased a cow, so you don't
know.

03:44:50.636 --> 03:44:53.056
LAURA: Yes I have! I purchased Dork the ox.

03:44:53.056 --> 03:44:54.738
MATT: An ox is not a cow.

03:44:54.738 --> 03:44:58.607
LAURA: Shit! How much do your cows normally cost,
darling?

03:44:58.607 --> 03:45:05.913
MATT: This is a good question. Let me look in the book.
I've not had to look up the cost of a cow before.

03:45:05.913 --> 03:45:26.572
I would put it at about maybe 40 gold each.

03:45:26.572 --> 03:45:29.083
LAURA: That's way more than I expected.

03:45:29.083 --> 03:45:33.606
MATT: Because they can be used for meat, they can
be used for milk.

03:45:33.606 --> 03:45:41.019
LAURA: 40 gold each to make up for the loss of
your cows.

03:45:41.019 --> 03:45:45.048
MATT: "Thank you so much. I greatly appreciate you
helping with this. And you promise, this will--"

03:45:45.048 --> 03:45:48.183
SAM: Yes, just put them out in the open field.

03:45:48.183 --> 03:45:49.225
TRAVIS: We'll take them.

03:45:49.225 --> 03:45:50.392
SAM: Oh, we'll take them?

03:45:50.392 --> 03:45:52.245
TRAVIS: We'll put them out there. Stake them.

03:45:52.245 --> 03:45:53.711
SAM: Okay, we'll take care of it.

03:45:53.711 --> 03:45:57.883
MATT: You guys take two of the cows. You bring
them to the outskirts. With rope tied around their

03:45:57.883 --> 03:46:05.281
neck, you essentially hitching-post them to the
outside of this open area, about 20 to 30 feet

03:46:05.281 --> 03:46:12.182
from the actual holding pen. A few hours go by,
and the sun slowly begins to rise.

03:46:12.182 --> 03:46:14.660
LAURA: Along with some other food, right?

03:46:14.660 --> 03:46:20.630
MATT: Place some of their feed and things around
there. Eventually, the sun begins to rise across

03:46:20.630 --> 03:46:27.182
the eastern sky. As it crests, you can see some of
the farmers come out, anxiously watching from

03:46:27.182 --> 03:46:35.879
their homes. You see different families gathering.
The wings beating in the air, and it swoops down

03:46:35.879 --> 03:46:40.866
(swoosh) and grabs two of them. You can see some
of the families gasp and rush inside, and some are

03:46:40.866 --> 03:46:47.700
amazed to see this even happen. It takes the two,
carries them up, and heads out over the Ozmit Sea,

03:46:47.700 --> 03:46:53.805
passing to the northwest side, and over the next
30 or so minutes, slowly disappears over the

03:46:53.805 --> 03:46:55.950
horizon until it's no longer visible.

03:46:55.950 --> 03:46:59.388
TRAVIS: The sun rose, right? Can I make a beard
check?

03:46:59.388 --> 03:47:01.207
(laughter)

03:47:01.207 --> 03:47:02.766
MATT: You may.

03:47:02.766 --> 03:47:04.707
TRAVIS: Two, zero.

03:47:04.707 --> 03:47:08.978
MATT: With that, (creak) the beginnings of the
other side of your beard slowly begins to set in.

03:47:08.978 --> 03:47:10.922
TRAVIS: What happens to the existing side?

03:47:10.922 --> 03:47:15.762
MATT: The existing side has rounded itself off to
a nice beard. It's pretty much where it's going to

03:47:15.762 --> 03:47:22.712
be on that side. The other side is now starting to
finally catch up. And that's where we'll end: on a

03:47:22.712 --> 03:47:25.089
successful beard check.

03:47:25.089 --> 03:47:30.433
SAM: Wow. That was a crazy night.

03:47:30.433 --> 03:47:37.151
TRAVIS: Perspiration was happening.

03:47:37.151 --> 03:47:38.886
MARISHA: Yeah, it was.

03:47:38.886 --> 03:47:40.791
SAM: I gave you my hand.

03:47:40.791 --> 03:47:44.691
MATT: More battle maps that will never get used.

03:47:44.691 --> 03:47:49.233
LAURA: Look at us not fighting things. That's
really beautiful.

03:47:49.233 --> 03:47:52.164
MATT: That would have been really bad, too.

03:47:52.164 --> 03:47:54.484
LAURA: I'm glad we didn't fight it.

03:47:54.484 --> 03:47:56.064
TRAVIS: Bad for us?

03:47:56.064 --> 03:47:58.917
MATT: Well, just imagine a giant bird that grabs
you and then drops you off the side of a mountain.

03:47:58.917 --> 03:48:10.223
Would have been an interesting fight. Cool. That
concludes a unique Percy-less bottle episode of

03:48:10.223 --> 03:48:11.397
Critical Role.

03:48:11.397 --> 03:48:13.267
TRAVIS: Squadron of cows.

03:48:13.267 --> 03:48:18.719
MATT: Squadron of flying midnight cows. That is
probably the weirdest thing that's ever-- no,

03:48:18.719 --> 03:48:22.931
there's been weirder. That's in the top five of
weird things that's happened in DND for me.

03:48:22.931 --> 03:48:24.598
SAM: Fighting "formootion."

03:48:24.598 --> 03:48:27.735
(groaning)

03:48:27.735 --> 04:41:17.460
