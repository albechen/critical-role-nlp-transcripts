00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.043
MATT: Hello, everyone and good evening. Welcome to
Critical Role, a show where a bunch of us

00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:08.936
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons. This will be our final

00:00:08.936 --> 00:00:13.660
episode for the year before we take our holiday
break, and for those of you who aren't currently

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.272
in the theater to see Star Wars or are not
planning to leave in the next five minutes to go

00:00:18.272 --> 00:00:22.061
see Star Wars, which we do not begrudge you that
whatsoever; many of us will be rushing off after

00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:27.117
this to do the same. For those of you staying with
us, thank you for kicking it and may the Force be

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:29.146
with you when this is over.

00:00:29.146 --> 00:00:35.789
So before we get started, let's go ahead and get a
few announcements out of the way. One, for those

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.687
of you who have been waiting extensively, because
I know you have been. Tomorrow, on the website you

00:00:39.687 --> 00:00:43.754
will have the Snugglelord playlist will be
premiering on GeekandSundry.com.

00:00:43.754 --> 00:00:48.151
ZAC: It's completely serious!

00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:49.639
MATT: It's totally serious.

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:50.757
MARISHA: So serial.

00:00:50.757 --> 00:00:53.002
MATT: Super serial, guys. Like, so serial.

00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:54.576
TALIESIN: For real-real, not for play-play.

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:59.511
MATT: (laughs) The next announcement, we had our
Critmas article go up earlier this week, our

00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:04.187
Critter's Guide to Critmas, where we each talk
about the different charities that we represent

00:01:04.187 --> 00:01:10.667
and if you want to try and give something to the
show and the goodwill we put out for that, it's a

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:16.794
really great way to see what each of us would like
to see presented or supported by the community. So

00:01:16.794 --> 00:01:21.447
if you haven't had a chance, go check it out and
feel some holiday spirit to give, go ahead and

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:24.475
pick any that are there or any of your own
charities and do what you can to help. So,

00:01:24.475 --> 00:01:31.770
appreciate that guys. Also, the most recent comic
went live for our Winter's Crest festival.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.976
LIAM: It's a good one.

00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:34.310
LAURA: It is a good one.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.837
TALIESIN: Grog pranking.

00:01:35.837 --> 00:01:36.823
MARISHA: Grog pranking.

00:01:36.823 --> 00:01:38.913
TALIESIN: Everybody loves Grog pranking.

00:01:38.913 --> 00:01:42.571
LIAM: It's a flight of fancy. It did not happen in
our game. It should have, but it didn't.

00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:47.020
MARISHA: Yeah. It's art imitating life.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.066
TALIESIN: We had to fluff it up a bit.

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:52.622
MARISHA: There was fluffing. Just a little
massaging.

00:01:52.622 --> 00:01:55.595
TALIESIN: Especially for you, we had to, we had to
fluff.

00:01:55.595 --> 00:01:57.013
MATT: The two fluffers.

00:01:57.013 --> 00:01:58.664
MARISHA: Three.

00:01:58.664 --> 00:02:05.840
MATT: (laughs) Yeah, so go check it out, it's a
lot of fun and plays into our Winter's Crest

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.263
festival this evening, though that one took place
a year ago in game technically. Two years, I

00:02:12.263 --> 00:02:16.677
guess, in game-- no, it was a year because the
original-- and all the events that transpired

00:02:16.677 --> 00:02:20.705
after that, there was the make-up Winter's Crest
festival. You don't know what we're talking about,

00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:22.158
but you may soon.

00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:24.419
TALIESIN: Just act like you know.

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:28.108
MATT: Which, speaking of which, we have a little
gift for you guys at the break today. We're going

00:02:28.108 --> 00:02:31.928
to have an extended mid-way break because we have
a gift that we've all put together for you that I

00:02:31.928 --> 00:02:33.115
think you'll enjoy.

00:02:33.115 --> 00:02:34.147
TALIESIN: It's cool.

00:02:34.147 --> 00:02:35.331
LAURA: It's so exciting.

00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:37.182
MATT: So, look forward to that.

00:02:37.182 --> 00:02:40.822
MARISHA: So no peeing today. No pee breaks.

00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:43.427
TALIESIN: Like Star Wars, just hold it until it's
over.

00:02:43.427 --> 00:02:47.613
MATT: Or be like me, just put in a catheter
beforehand, works out really well. Don't do that,

00:02:47.613 --> 00:02:56.625
don't do that. Please don't do that. (laughs)
Thanks for the support, guys. And Wyrmwood Gaming.

00:02:56.625 --> 00:02:58.328
Liam, if you want to go grab that real fast?

00:02:58.328 --> 00:03:02.671
LIAM: Wyrmwood Gaming, they make gorgeous,
beautiful gaming boxes. They make lovely Christmas

00:03:02.671 --> 00:03:09.414
presents and if you use the code CritRole, you
will not have to pay for shipping on your Wyrmwood

00:03:09.414 --> 00:03:11.275
Gaming order. They're gorgeous.

00:03:11.275 --> 00:03:18.559
TRAVIS: Smells like twenties. Natural twenties.
I'm working on it. I'm polishing.

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:21.769
TALIESIN: Keep workshopping that.

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.221
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm working on it.

00:03:23.262 --> 00:03:24.652
MATT: We'll have a Sam here with us shortly.

00:03:24.652 --> 00:03:25.734
LAURA: Oh, Sam is here.

00:03:25.734 --> 00:03:26.761
TRAVIS: I'll go get him!

00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:27.912
MATT: Very shortly.

00:03:27.912 --> 00:03:31.135
LAURA: Go, Travis, run like the wind!

00:03:31.135 --> 00:03:35.850
LIAM: Clarence! Bring the gnome in, Clarence!

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.369
MATT: I guess while we're waiting for him--
(laughs) Travis is going to be really

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:44.051
disappointed.

00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:46.330
(laughter)

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.879
LIAM: Ah, Grog pranked again!

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.985
SAM: It's okay, I'll go get Travis.

00:03:52.985 --> 00:03:58.273
TALIESIN: (sings Benny Hill theme)

00:03:58.273 --> 00:04:06.095
MATT: This is the rest of our show tonight. Just
three hours of this. It's going to be great. So,

00:04:06.095 --> 00:04:08.214
if you want to show the cookies that--

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:16.732
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. My girlfriend made cookies
for-- I'll put this one on the--

00:04:16.732 --> 00:04:17.869
MATT: On the mat, here?

00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:19.075
LAURA: I took a picture.

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:21.936
MARISHA: Hold them closer to the camera. Hold them
to the sky.

00:04:21.936 --> 00:04:26.713
LIAM: Wow, that was what that camera was purchased
for.

00:04:26.713 --> 00:04:28.381
MATT: This is now officially the cookie cam.

00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:32.508
LAURA: Raise them up, Taliesin. Raise them to the
air. Closer to the camera.

00:04:32.508 --> 00:04:35.954
MATT: How do--

00:04:35.954 --> 00:04:39.934
LAURA: You want oh wah ta goo.

00:04:39.934 --> 00:04:41.591
MATT: How do Pike do this?

00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:43.594
MARISHA: (laughs) How do Pike do this?

00:04:43.594 --> 00:04:46.946
MATT: How do Grog do this?

00:04:46.946 --> 00:04:53.622
LAURA: They're so cute. There's little baby
Trinkets.

00:04:53.622 --> 00:04:57.746
TRAVIS: It's really pretty. And it makes it hard
to eat.

00:04:57.746 --> 00:05:03.138
MARISHA: I like the little gingerbread, with
little lederhosen and they got little goats and

00:05:03.138 --> 00:05:04.540
reindeer in lederhosen.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.085
LAURA: This is exciting, you guys.

00:05:06.085 --> 00:05:07.938
MATT: Travis. Can you let Sam in for me?

00:05:07.938 --> 00:05:09.591
TRAVIS: He's already here.

00:05:09.672 --> 00:05:10.762
LIAM: Christmas TPK.

00:05:10.762 --> 00:05:12.401
MARISHA: Oh, look at that Keyleth one!

00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:14.943
LAURA: But they're so cute, I don't want to eat
it.

00:05:14.943 --> 00:05:17.459
MATT: All righty.

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:19.617
LAURA: I'll have a snowflake, please.

00:05:19.617 --> 00:05:24.515
MATT: Any other announcements you wish to make, or
shall we go onward?

00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:32.982
TRAVIS: Any other announcements we should make,
you fucking-- cookie-- pass arounder? Cookie

00:05:32.982 --> 00:05:34.108
distributor?

00:05:34.108 --> 00:05:36.284
LAURA: Oh! You know what, I do have something.

00:05:36.284 --> 00:05:37.878
LIAM: What's that?

00:05:37.878 --> 00:05:42.485
LAURA: Glitter Force. It's a new show.
It's going to be on Netflix tomorrow. So I play

00:05:42.485 --> 00:05:44.301
the main girl, so that's exciting.

00:05:44.301 --> 00:05:45.492
MARISHA: Oh, that's awesome.

00:05:45.492 --> 00:05:46.679
LAURA: It's great for little girls.

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:47.920
TRAVIS: (muffled) Super cute and funny.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.126
LAURA: Yeah it is, it's adorable and it's funny.

00:05:49.126 --> 00:05:50.597
LIAM: And 25-year-old guys.

00:05:50.597 --> 00:05:52.362
LAURA: And 25-- whoever wants to watch it.

00:05:52.362 --> 00:05:54.341
MARISHA: Are they going to make the next Bronies?

00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:59.787
LAURA: I don't know, but there are like a lot of--
I mean, it's called the Glitter Force. There are a

00:05:59.787 --> 00:06:01.593
lot of cute little make-up accessories.

00:06:01.593 --> 00:06:03.015
LIAM: I already have all the merchandise.

00:06:03.015 --> 00:06:05.754
LAURA: Yeah. I'm touching every cookie in this
box.

00:06:05.873 --> 00:06:09.293
MATT: How very Vex of you (laughs).

00:06:09.293 --> 00:06:12.061
TALIESIN: There's also some whipped cream if you
want to dip.

00:06:12.061 --> 00:06:13.024
LAURA: Yes.

00:06:13.024 --> 00:06:14.940
MARISHA: Touch all the whipped cream, too.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.280
MATT: And on that note.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.436
(laughter)

00:06:18.436 --> 00:06:27.378
MATT: Let us go ahead and bring our way into this
evening's game. So, to-- hey!

00:06:27.378 --> 00:06:28.522
TALIESIN: Sorry.

00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:33.812
MATT: It's all good. Sam will show up; it's fine.

00:06:33.812 --> 00:06:37.770
TRAVIS: It's like the devil. Say his name and he
will appear.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.726
SAM: I couldn't find Travis anywhere.

00:06:39.726 --> 00:06:42.818
LIAM: Cookie icing on your lips.

00:06:42.818 --> 00:06:47.679
TRAVIS: You look like you literally came from the
set of Mad Max. Did you just witness?

00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:49.227
LIAM: Glam rock.

00:06:49.227 --> 00:06:53.463
TRAVIS: Did he tell you he loved you, or what?

00:06:53.463 --> 00:06:54.930
SAM: They had me eat--

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.938
LAURA: Oh, I know what it is. Okay.

00:06:59.938 --> 00:07:01.283
SAM: Some stuff.

00:07:01.283 --> 00:07:04.027
TALIESIN: Scanlan stocking cookie there.

00:07:04.062 --> 00:07:05.100
SAM: Oh, that's so nice.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.887
MATT: That's adorable. All right.

00:07:07.887 --> 00:07:09.278
TRAVIS: We're locked in!

00:07:09.278 --> 00:07:16.253
MATT: Let's do this. Bring it in. So, to get you guys
up to speed quickly, for those of you who are

00:07:16.253 --> 00:07:23.194
coming in fresh. Oh, what an episode to jump into.
So, the intrepid group of adventurers known as Vox

00:07:23.194 --> 00:07:29.447
Machina had made their way to the city of
Whitestone, a town that Percival here grew up in

00:07:29.447 --> 00:07:34.370
and had taken from him and his family five years
ago, most of his family, the de Rolos, being murdered

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:41.012
in the process. The Briarwoods, who had taken the
town rather quickly and covertly held it for five

00:07:41.012 --> 00:07:47.562
years had now been building toward some sort of a
ritual, some sort of event that the party was

00:07:47.562 --> 00:07:52.031
investigating. They incited a rebellion within the
city of Whitestone, gathering the remaining

00:07:52.031 --> 00:07:55.818
members to take up arms and fight against this
undead scourge that had kept them locked down for

00:07:55.818 --> 00:07:57.519
so long, oppressed for so long.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:04.467
After managing to take out some of the various
operatives under the Briarwoods' regime, they made

00:08:04.467 --> 00:08:09.414
their way into Castle Whitestone itself, saved
Percy's sister, Cassandra, thought dead for a long

00:08:09.414 --> 00:08:16.329
time, got vengeance upon a number of individuals
that were on his List, except for Ripley, who got

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:23.116
away. Fought their way down underneath the city of
Whitestone, fell into an acid-based trap, made

00:08:23.116 --> 00:08:27.321
their way to the ziggurat, this construct beneath
the city of Whitestone, where some ritual was

00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:34.367
attempting to be completed by Lady Delilah
Briarwood. It was discovered that the patron they

00:08:34.367 --> 00:08:41.906
spoke of, the Whispered One, had been in previous
bits of history spoken as Vecna, a powerful lich

00:08:41.906 --> 00:08:46.564
of ancient history that had attempted to ascend to
godhood at some point in the past.

00:08:46.564 --> 00:08:59.558
They managed to tackle the Briarwoods, destroy
Sylas, defeat Delilah, and dragging them back,

00:08:59.558 --> 00:09:07.100
decided to interrogate. In the process of trying
to extract information, Percy's dark harbinger,

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.662
his dark passenger, if you will... who was a
tongue-waggling dog for a moment.

00:09:12.662 --> 00:09:15.186
TALIESIN: I was making an evil shadow.

00:09:15.186 --> 00:09:16.710
MATT: I see.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.175
TALIESIN: Evil shadow.

00:09:19.242 --> 00:09:22.907
LIAM: "Kill them all, Percy. Kill them all."

00:09:22.948 --> 00:09:26.350
MATT: Pressured to incite the
vengeance that apparently the pact he made with this

00:09:26.379 --> 00:09:33.601
entity required. Upon fighting its will, it was
jettisoned from his form and the party battled

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:39.792
this deranged greater smoke demon-like entity in
the center of this cavern. During this fight, Lady

00:09:39.902 --> 00:09:42.911
Briarwood tried to escape, however, found a dagger
in the middle of her back,

00:09:42.911 --> 00:09:44.367
thanks to Vax over there.

00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:45.413
LAURA: Good job.

00:09:45.413 --> 00:09:50.805
MATT: Stripped of her possessions, and then
Cassandra dragging her into the nearby acid baths,

00:09:50.805 --> 00:10:00.357
tossing her body within to leave her story to a
definite conclusion. Scanlan, being very astute,

00:10:00.357 --> 00:10:03.788
apparently, in some observations, and as
convincing as he can be, managed to wrestle

00:10:03.788 --> 00:10:09.331
Percy's weapon, his List, his Pepperbox, from his
grip, and tossed it into the very acid pits,

00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:17.024
destroying his greatest creation and in doing so,
seemingly breaking whatever hold this shadow demon

00:10:17.024 --> 00:10:19.606
had on Percy's soul.

00:10:19.606 --> 00:10:21.308
SAM: The Way of the Gun.

00:10:21.308 --> 00:10:25.111
TRAVIS: The Quick and the Dead.

00:10:25.111 --> 00:10:28.615
LIAM: A couple weeks in detox and you'll be fine.

00:10:28.615 --> 00:10:30.181
MARISHA: It's true.

00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:32.368
LAURA: It was an intervention, Percy.

00:10:32.368 --> 00:10:34.144
SAM: Had to be done.

00:10:34.144 --> 00:10:37.916
MATT: Upon returning to the city of Whitestone,
they found the rebellion was successful. The

00:10:37.916 --> 00:10:46.416
undead hordes had fallen to the blades of the
surviving rallying warriors of Whitestone. Keeper

00:10:46.416 --> 00:10:51.869
Yennen, who currently was the, essentially, leader
of the rebellion while you guys were going into

00:10:51.869 --> 00:10:55.990
the castle, met with you. You guys were brought to
the center of town, where you began to see the

00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:01.549
rest of Whitestone emerge: the families, the
children, the people that had been too scared to

00:11:01.549 --> 00:11:05.916
go outside finally came out to celebrate victory,
the first real breath of free air they've had in

00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:08.742
five years since the Briarwoods took the city.

00:11:08.742 --> 00:11:16.337
Some justice was doled to a few survivors of the
Briarwoods' regime. And you were asked to stay

00:11:16.337 --> 00:11:22.105
behind to help rebuild and prepare for the coming
Winter's Crest festival, of which you agreed. A

00:11:22.105 --> 00:11:30.506
few awkward moments and a few delightful bits of
interpersonal comedy brought you guys to this

00:11:30.506 --> 00:11:38.295
point and now we begin tonight's session of
Critical Role. So, to start off, leading up to

00:11:38.295 --> 00:11:45.658
this Winter's Crest festival, about a two-week
period, what would you guys like to individually

00:11:45.658 --> 00:11:47.513
do in this time to prepare for the festival?

00:11:47.513 --> 00:11:48.631
TRAVIS: We have two weeks?

00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:51.511
MATT: Yeah, essentially. The two-week period, we're doing
a bit of a time jump here, so if there's anything

00:11:51.547 --> 00:11:54.949
in particular you want to do or attempt in this
time period, now's the time to do so before we get

00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:56.311
to the actual event.

00:11:56.311 --> 00:12:03.248
TRAVIS: I had a question. Could I go around
lifting up various wagons and maybe ponies,

00:12:03.248 --> 00:12:07.465
working out to try to increase my strength?

00:12:07.465 --> 00:12:10.108
(laughter)

00:12:10.108 --> 00:12:13.611
TRAVIS: Or just randomly picking shit up and not
have an excuse for it. That was good, too.

00:12:13.611 --> 00:12:18.184
MARISHA: I mean, the town's in tatters. You could
be productive and pick things up.

00:12:18.184 --> 00:12:21.480
TRAVIS: Yeah! Or you know, I pick up a
hammer in the morning.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.074
LAURA: And you're helping to rebuild.

00:12:24.108 --> 00:12:25.241
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:26.218
SAM: Like Rocky IV.

00:12:26.218 --> 00:12:27.049
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:12:27.049 --> 00:12:33.551
MATT: Yeah, in a brilliant holiday montage, as the
cold weather finds its way into the valley of

00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:42.241
Whitestone, Grog goes around aiding many of the
groups repairing and reassembling the glory of

00:12:42.241 --> 00:12:45.636
Whitestone, finding the structures that are broken
or destroyed and trying to clean them, prepare for

00:12:45.636 --> 00:12:52.172
new building properties. You come by, eagerly
lifting, carrying, dropping, slamming, and holding

00:12:52.172 --> 00:12:58.543
in place extremely heavy pieces of stone and
masonry. In some cases, putting a few of the local

00:12:58.543 --> 00:13:06.089
strong men to shame and some of the local ladies,
very blush-worthy in your presence. You are very

00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:10.102
happy. Go ahead and make three strength checks for
me.

00:13:10.102 --> 00:13:16.802
TRAVIS: Oh shit, three of them. That's a 24.

00:13:16.802 --> 00:13:18.923
MATT: Okay, second one?

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:21.218
TRAVIS: That's a 22.

00:13:21.218 --> 00:13:22.685
MATT: All right.

00:13:22.685 --> 00:13:27.028
TRAVIS: 22. 24, 22, 22.

00:13:27.028 --> 00:13:31.698
MATT: Through the process of these two weeks, not
only have you managed to surprise the local

00:13:31.794 --> 00:13:37.687
denizens of the city with your feats of strength
and masculine physique-- as when Grog is building,

00:13:37.752 --> 00:13:39.297
Grog does so shirtless.

00:13:39.297 --> 00:13:46.080
TRAVIS: (laughs) As anything. Might as well get a
show out of it.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:53.577
MATT: In doing so, some of the local denizens pull
some cash to the side to thank you for your

00:13:53.577 --> 00:14:00.460
efforts. You find at the end of the week you are
granted a small pouch which contains 315 gold

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:06.617
pieces as a thanks from the locals for all the
help both in the rebellion, the freeing of

00:14:06.617 --> 00:14:09.254
Whitestone, and for your feats of magnificent
musculature.

00:14:09.254 --> 00:14:12.768
TRAVIS: I don't feel like I should take this.

00:14:12.812 --> 00:14:15.019
LAURA: You should take it.

00:14:15.019 --> 00:14:16.729
TRAVIS: It's a lot of money.

00:14:16.729 --> 00:14:17.938
LAURA: You should take it.

00:14:17.938 --> 00:14:22.479
TRAVIS: How about you refill my cask of ale
instead?

00:14:22.479 --> 00:14:24.008
SAM: Ooh.

00:14:24.008 --> 00:14:25.840
LIAM: Happy Festivus.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.964
TRAVIS: And you give me one gold piece so Vex
doesn't kill me.

00:14:28.964 --> 00:14:36.632
MATT: The crowd look among themselves and one of
the lead architects for this whole endeavor nods

00:14:36.632 --> 00:14:41.747
to you. "Sounds like a fair trade. If you're
certain, sir."

00:14:41.747 --> 00:14:46.887
TRAVIS: I'm a very stringent businessman. Do
hurry before I change my mind.

00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:50.531
MATT: Gold piece is in your hand faster than you
have a chance to-- you chip a tooth.

00:14:50.531 --> 00:14:55.527
TRAVIS: I don't understand this practice. It
tastes like shit. Tastes fucking horrible.

00:14:55.527 --> 00:15:00.513
MATT: Two casks of their precious ale roll up to
the base of your foot.

00:15:00.513 --> 00:15:01.769
TRAVIS: (gasps) Two?!

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:02.963
MATT: Two.

00:15:02.963 --> 00:15:09.148
TRAVIS: One for each arm, eh? All right, the one
that I have, I'm not stopping, until it's

00:15:09.195 --> 00:15:13.563
completely empty. Bring your goblets and cups.
It's time to get fucked up.

00:15:13.563 --> 00:15:17.506
MATT: (laughs) Fantastic. All right, Vex.

00:15:17.506 --> 00:15:23.361
LAURA: Well, I got the ring and the bracers that I
need to get checked out, see what they are.

00:15:23.495 --> 00:15:25.337
MATT: And the robe?

00:15:25.337 --> 00:15:29.004
LIAM: Oh, the robe. No, I threw it down, though.

00:15:29.004 --> 00:15:30.474
TALIESIN: You picked it up.

00:15:30.474 --> 00:15:31.658
LIAM: You picked it up.

00:15:31.658 --> 00:15:32.810
LAURA: I have the robe, too.

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:33.717
MATT: Okay.

00:15:33.717 --> 00:15:35.980
LAURA: We left her naked. Yes, we did.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.538
MATT: You kind of did, actually.

00:15:37.538 --> 00:15:39.059
TALIESIN: Like properly.

00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:46.070
MATT: A few things here, actually.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.912
TRAVIS: Oh Vex, I made gold.

00:15:48.912 --> 00:15:54.627
LAURA: Oh wow, thank you, that's amazing, Grog.
Where did you find this piece of gold?

00:15:54.627 --> 00:15:57.801
TRAVIS: Oh, I got it for fixing a bunch of shit
around town. Are you going to taste it?

00:15:57.801 --> 00:16:02.626
LAURA: No, I'm not. It's already got a lot of
drool on it, actually.

00:16:02.626 --> 00:16:05.288
TRAVIS: But how do you know if it's gold if you
don't taste it?

00:16:05.288 --> 00:16:08.370
LAURA: I'm just going to put it in with the rest
of the gold, Grog.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:16.401
TRAVIS: Shit. I'm going to pull one over on her
one of these days. Can you make things look like

00:16:16.401 --> 00:16:17.772
they're gold?

00:16:17.772 --> 00:16:18.768
SAM: I can, actually.

00:16:18.768 --> 00:16:19.692
TRAVIS: You can?

00:16:19.692 --> 00:16:20.918
SAM: Yes.

00:16:20.918 --> 00:16:22.214
MATT: All right.

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:24.933
TRAVIS: I've had my thought for the day, there's
nothing else.

00:16:24.933 --> 00:16:27.492
SAM: When you have the punchline, let me know.

00:16:27.492 --> 00:16:32.099
TRAVIS: It's a standby TV symbol right now. That's
all I got.

00:16:32.099 --> 00:16:36.710
MATT: So, as you take some time, first off, I want
you to go ahead and roll an investigation check.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:40.896
LAURA: Aw man, I've got to roll for this? I'm
going to roll one of my new dice.

00:16:40.896 --> 00:16:45.069
Well, it's for--

00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:47.716
MATT: What was that sound?

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:49.806
LAURA: It was exciting! 24.

00:16:49.806 --> 00:16:55.347
MATT: 24, okay. So as you begin pulling out the
items and begin separating, before you can even

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:59.932
begin the initial inspection, as you are pulling
the robe out, you find there is a slight poke.

00:16:59.932 --> 00:17:02.386
There's something thin--

00:17:02.386 --> 00:17:04.505
LAURA: (singing) Feel a little poke coming
through.

00:17:04.505 --> 00:17:10.640
MATT: Not that kind of poke. You unravel that part
of the robe and find there's a long deep pocket on

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:17.197
the inside of the robe. And inside, there's a long
gnarled piece of deep maroon wood that is carved

00:17:17.197 --> 00:17:18.619
into a wand shape.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:21.448
SAM: What kind of a wand?

00:17:21.448 --> 00:17:27.957
MATT: I'm trying to find the actual item card
here. Found it! There we go.

00:17:27.957 --> 00:17:35.078
SAM: I want it.

00:17:35.078 --> 00:17:38.052
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:17:38.052 --> 00:17:39.269
SAM: I want it.

00:17:39.269 --> 00:17:43.778
LAURA: Oh, did you find it? Did you find it in the
group? Are you even standing near me right now, as

00:17:43.778 --> 00:17:44.946
I'm seeing this wand?

00:17:44.946 --> 00:17:46.983
SAM: Of course I am. I'm always with you.

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:49.238
LAURA: How do you know I'm not doing it in my
room?

00:17:49.238 --> 00:17:51.069
SAM: Are you?

00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:51.812
LAURA: Yes.

00:17:51.812 --> 00:17:54.125
TALIESIN: What's she wearing right now?

00:17:54.125 --> 00:17:56.073
SAM: Why I am in your room?!

00:17:56.073 --> 00:17:58.249
LAURA: Scanlan, get out of here, I'm naked.

00:17:58.249 --> 00:18:03.727
SAM: Oh I know, I came in here to tell you, to ask
you something: where's my wand?

00:18:03.727 --> 00:18:07.677
(laughter)

00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:12.840
LAURA: Ugh, I've got to look at this a bit more
before I give this to you because it is very, very

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:20.734
good. It is a Wand of Fireballs, by the way,
people. It has seven charges; while holding it,

00:18:20.734 --> 00:18:26.423
you can use an action to expend one or more of its
charges to cast the Fireball spell, DC of 15, one

00:18:26.423 --> 00:18:30.181
charge you cast at third level-- so many words. I
don't even understand.

00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:35.438
LIAM: A fan art of this moment, please?

00:18:35.438 --> 00:18:37.635
LAURA: But also--

00:18:37.635 --> 00:18:42.306
MATT: You recall, actually, as you went over the
top at the initial battle with Lady Briarwood,

00:18:42.333 --> 00:18:45.542
that was what she pulled out and managed to blast
all of you with at once when you all were on the

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:46.628
top of the temple.

00:18:46.628 --> 00:18:48.701
LAURA: Nice. I'm just going to put this in my
pocket.

00:18:48.701 --> 00:18:50.780
LIAM: I thought you were naked.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:56.894
LAURA: I'll put it in the pocket of the outfit I'm
about to put on. And then the ring and the

00:18:56.894 --> 00:18:57.855
bracers?

00:18:57.855 --> 00:19:00.290
MATT: I'll get those right now. There you go.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.259
LAURA: Wait, Grog, don't sit down.

00:19:02.259 --> 00:19:03.655
TALIESIN: This is why it's Christmas.

00:19:03.655 --> 00:19:04.799
SAM: Where's my ring?

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:06.442
MARISHA: What's the ring do?

00:19:06.442 --> 00:19:08.732
LAURA: Oh my god. I found so many amazing things,
you guys.

00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:12.287
TRAVIS: Those are bracers--

00:19:12.287 --> 00:19:13.288
LAURA: No!

00:19:13.288 --> 00:19:14.642
SAM: Those are mine. I found them.

00:19:14.642 --> 00:19:17.212
TRAVIS: Grog will believe whatever you say.

00:19:17.212 --> 00:19:25.608
LAURA: No! I'm reading them all; they're mine!
Ring of Lightning Resistance. Who wants a Ring of

00:19:25.608 --> 00:19:28.173
Lightning Resistance?

00:19:28.173 --> 00:19:32.340
SAM: Sure.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:37.933
LAURA: Bracers of Defense. Who needs extra
defense? You're really weak. Your AC's super low,

00:19:38.075 --> 00:19:38.824
isn't it?

00:19:38.824 --> 00:19:39.666
LIAM: It is.

00:19:39.666 --> 00:19:42.439
MATT: Bracers of Defense will technically only
really benefit anybody who's not wearing armor.

00:19:42.439 --> 00:19:43.564
LIAM: Not wearing armor?

00:19:43.564 --> 00:19:44.411
MATT: Correct.

00:19:44.411 --> 00:19:45.225
MARISHA: Like Grog?

00:19:45.225 --> 00:19:46.207
MATT: Like monks.

00:19:46.207 --> 00:19:47.896
LAURA: There you go.

00:19:47.896 --> 00:19:51.411
LIAM: Thank goodness, because he is a blushing
flower in the wind.

00:19:51.411 --> 00:19:57.092
MATT: If you currently have-- is it an amulet that
helps your armor? We'll go through your AC and

00:19:57.092 --> 00:19:59.330
find out if it overlaps with any other benefits.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:00.731
TRAVIS: I do have the Amulet of Armor.

00:20:00.731 --> 00:20:04.060
MATT: Right, so basically that would replace that
and you would now have an amulet slot open for any

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.523
sort of future enchantment stuff.

00:20:05.523 --> 00:20:07.886
LIAM: I'll take the amulet.

00:20:07.886 --> 00:20:10.078
MATT: You could give the amulet to somebody else if
you want to.

00:20:10.078 --> 00:20:12.017
LIAM: He'll never give it to me.

00:20:12.166 --> 00:20:17.031
MARISHA: He was willing to do it until you gave
him the idea to not do it.

00:20:17.031 --> 00:20:18.170
LIAM: That's fine.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:19.722
TRAVIS: Can't remind me of these things.

00:20:19.722 --> 00:20:23.214
LAURA: Okay, a Robe of Shielding Shadows. Can it
be worn with armor?

00:20:23.214 --> 00:20:24.642
MATT: No.

00:20:24.642 --> 00:20:31.211
LAURA: Oh man. It's just a robe. It's her dress,
basically, and it gives you resistance to piercing

00:20:31.211 --> 00:20:32.540
damage.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.019
LIAM: You know what we can do with that? Sell it.

00:20:35.019 --> 00:20:36.574
SAM: Or give it to me.

00:20:36.574 --> 00:20:38.318
LAURA: You have armor, dude.

00:20:38.318 --> 00:20:39.772
SAM: Oh, okay.

00:20:39.772 --> 00:20:41.040
MARISHA: It takes an armor slot.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.431
LAURA: And it's a woman's robe.

00:20:42.431 --> 00:20:44.592
SAM: I can make that work.

00:20:44.592 --> 00:20:45.941
LAURA: Yeah, you totally could.

00:20:45.941 --> 00:20:53.018
MARISHA: Can we take the fabric and sew it into a
nice afghan or something?

00:20:53.018 --> 00:20:57.972
MATT: You can certainly try. It would probably
ruin the enchantment.

00:20:57.972 --> 00:21:01.857
LAURA: Oh, it would ruin the enchantment? If you
sew it differently?

00:21:01.857 --> 00:21:06.011
MARISHA: What if you don't cut into it?

00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:08.565
LAURA: What if we fold it?

00:21:08.565 --> 00:21:10.508
TALIESIN: What if we just tie the dress around our
neck?

00:21:10.508 --> 00:21:14.700
LAURA: Maybe just put your arms through it and
then let it ride behind you like a cape?

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.115
MARISHA: Right, it's like one of those "wear nine
different ways" dresses?

00:21:17.115 --> 00:21:23.569
MATT: You can wear it however you want and you
will discover one way or another if it actually

00:21:23.569 --> 00:21:24.944
gives an effect.

00:21:24.944 --> 00:21:30.101
LAURA: Well, I'm just going to pocket this because
we may sell it, how about that. And then, a Ring

00:21:30.153 --> 00:21:34.634
of Lightning Resistance, anybody want it? How many
rings can we wear at one time?

00:21:34.634 --> 00:21:35.967
MATT: Two. One on each hand.

00:21:35.967 --> 00:21:38.050
TALIESIN: I would not say no to a Ring of
Lightning Resistance.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.353
LAURA: Pass that over to Percy.

00:21:39.353 --> 00:21:42.348
TALIESIN: I've got plans. At the moment, it's the
only way to charge my glove.

00:21:42.348 --> 00:21:49.607
LAURA: All right, and this Wand of Fireballs? I
feel like Scanlan needs it more than anyone else.

00:21:49.607 --> 00:21:51.393
SAM: I already have a wand that shoots things.

00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:53.256
LIAM: You're the only one who can use it.

00:21:53.256 --> 00:21:56.137
SAM: Oh, I'm the only one who can use it? I'll
take it, then.

00:21:56.137 --> 00:21:59.625
LAURA: I might just sell this robe, though.

00:21:59.625 --> 00:22:05.314
TRAVIS: I know how you work it, it's swish and
flick. Fireball.

00:22:05.314 --> 00:22:08.012
LAURA: Swish and flick.

00:22:08.012 --> 00:22:09.842
MATT: What could possibly go wrong?

00:22:09.842 --> 00:22:14.887
TRAVIS: What if a non-spellcaster uses a wand?
Nothing, right?

00:22:14.887 --> 00:22:17.634
LAURA: No. Anyone can use it.

00:22:17.634 --> 00:22:18.849
TRAVIS: Should we try it?

00:22:18.849 --> 00:22:20.195
LIAM: Yes, you should try it.

00:22:20.195 --> 00:22:26.356
TRAVIS: I am a walking crash test dummy. I mean,
we can try it. It'll be fine.

00:22:26.356 --> 00:22:29.774
MATT: That's my favorite mindset.

00:22:29.774 --> 00:22:33.111
LAURA: And then I'm going to mostly for the rest
of the time, keep to myself and Trinket and I'm

00:22:33.111 --> 00:22:35.381
going to help the townspeople rebuild a bit.

00:22:35.381 --> 00:22:38.879
MATT: All right. Wondrous. Vax?

00:22:38.879 --> 00:22:47.590
LIAM: I am also going to keep to myself and I'm
going to talk to the people in town, see what

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:54.197
businesses are open or trying to open, see what
they need. And I would like to talk to Percy,

00:22:54.197 --> 00:23:02.165
since I don't know anyone here, about who I could
talk to about getting messages to Emon, and I

00:23:02.165 --> 00:23:09.927
would like to get a message to Gilmore, to see if
he can fill any need here. If trade is so ruined

00:23:09.927 --> 00:23:16.998
here, that Gilmore could be a help. And Gilmore
gets another front, a place to do business and

00:23:16.998 --> 00:23:19.443
actually do good in a place that needs it.

00:23:19.443 --> 00:23:20.984
MARISHA: Gilmore's Glorious Books.

00:23:20.984 --> 00:23:21.922
SAM: That's right.

00:23:21.922 --> 00:23:23.428
LAURA: I like it.

00:23:23.428 --> 00:23:30.365
MATT: Over bits of a period of discussion, for the
most part, any sort of non-official courier

00:23:30.365 --> 00:23:36.026
service has been negated in the town. However,
there is now a glut of people that are, after the

00:23:36.026 --> 00:23:42.724
devastation, especially the ensuing rebellion,
folks that need work and need coin and there are

00:23:42.724 --> 00:23:46.976
many individuals that would be more than willing
to, for a handful of gold coins, make the journey

00:23:46.976 --> 00:23:49.469
to Emon delivering any messages you like.

00:23:49.469 --> 00:24:03.788
LIAM: Well, I will write a message to Gilly and
say that they're hurting here. They need trade, all the

00:24:03.788 --> 00:24:09.876
supplies that he's able to supply and tell him
that this town is about to explode and is

00:24:09.924 --> 00:24:11.945
definitely a good place for his wares.

00:24:11.945 --> 00:24:16.765
LAURA: Are you going to break up with him in the
letter too? Are you going to tell him that you're

00:24:16.765 --> 00:24:21.202
going to break his heart as soon as he writes you
back? Is that what's going to happen? I'm sorry,

00:24:21.202 --> 00:24:23.303
I'm just looking at your letter as you're writing
it.

00:24:23.303 --> 00:24:27.777
LIAM: No, because I've been avoiding her as well.
I'm avoiding everybody except for Percival, who

00:24:27.777 --> 00:24:29.308
I've been asking advice from.

00:24:29.308 --> 00:24:33.742
MATT: Okay. Do you also have the cloak? Did you
take the cloak?

00:24:33.742 --> 00:24:36.928
LIAM: I have the cloak, yeah. Yeah, dibs on that.

00:24:36.928 --> 00:24:44.208
MATT: Fine pickings off the corpses of the two
major villains of the previous arc.

00:24:44.208 --> 00:24:46.345
LIAM: Yes.

00:24:46.345 --> 00:24:48.402
TALIESIN: More corpse picking to do.

00:24:48.402 --> 00:24:50.090
MATT: Exactly.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:56.716
LAURA: What?! You have so many cloaks, though. Why
do you need another one?

00:24:56.716 --> 00:24:58.700
SAM: He's opening a cloak factory.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.466
TALIESIN: Gilmore's Glorious Cloaks.

00:25:01.466 --> 00:25:04.670
MATT: Cloak hoarding over here. All right,
Scanlan.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.725
SAM: I wanted to do four things.

00:25:07.725 --> 00:25:09.164
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:25:09.164 --> 00:25:19.764
SAM: One, compose an epic poem to commemorate the
rebels rising up against the empire that had kept

00:25:19.764 --> 00:25:29.554
them down for so long. Sort of a force that had
awakened. I call it...

00:25:29.564 --> 00:25:31.372
Resident Evil. 
I don't know why.

00:25:31.425 --> 00:25:36.365
Because they're residents and there was evil.
I couldn't come up with another name for it.

00:25:36.413 --> 00:25:44.041
They're residents of the town and there was an
evil. That's all. So, I'm looking for a

00:25:44.074 --> 00:25:45.105
publisher.

00:25:45.105 --> 00:25:48.810
MATT: Okay, good. There may be a grand opportunity
at the Winter's Crest festival to perform this.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.941
SAM: Oh-- gulp.

00:25:50.941 --> 00:25:53.895
LIAM: Disney and Capcom will be calling.

00:25:53.895 --> 00:26:03.069
SAM: I also wanted to make sure that we were using
the treasury, coordinating with Percy to open a

00:26:03.069 --> 00:26:08.669
library for the people to help them rebuild their
place, which sounds like Vax is already on. I also

00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:18.204
commissioned a portrait of myself. I don't know if
you-- I found a young artisan in town that I paid

00:26:18.204 --> 00:26:24.311
him some coin to paint me something that could
possibly hang in the keep, at Greyskull, in the

00:26:24.311 --> 00:26:25.692
dining room.

00:26:25.692 --> 00:26:32.876
MATT: Okay. After asking around for a few days,
you manage to discover there is a budding local

00:26:32.876 --> 00:26:35.732
artist who doesn't really believe in his artwork.
He currently works in the stables on the far

00:26:35.732 --> 00:26:41.740
southwest side of town. But people have seen some
of his work and tried to bolster him, so you're

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.082
sent in his direction and as you get there, you
can see him. He's currently in the process of

00:26:45.082 --> 00:26:49.383
actually cutting through one of his recent works
he wasn't happy with and he's violently tearing

00:26:49.383 --> 00:26:53.763
through it. As you step into the stable, he stops
and puts it off to the side.

00:26:53.763 --> 00:26:56.834
"Sorry, sir, can I help you?"

00:26:56.834 --> 00:27:06.249
SAM: Ah, hello. My name is Scanlan Shorthalt. I
was the leader of the rebellion that just defeated

00:27:06.249 --> 00:27:08.089
Lord and Lady Briarwood.

00:27:08.089 --> 00:27:13.348
MATT: "Oh! The pleasure is mine." He is now
averting his gaze and almost bowing his head like

00:27:13.348 --> 00:27:17.907
you're royalty. He's very flustered and flushed by
the sudden appearance.

00:27:17.907 --> 00:27:25.014
SAM: I hear you are a budding artist and I am, if
nothing else, a supporter of the arts.

00:27:25.014 --> 00:27:33.117
MATT: "My talents are far unrefined and nowhere
near powerful or

00:27:33.117 --> 00:27:35.416
"decent enough for your attentions."

00:27:35.416 --> 00:27:45.515
SAM: Well, I believe in you. And I need you for a
very important commission. A great good has been

00:27:45.515 --> 00:27:52.589
done here by the rebels, by the townspeople, with
the help of Vox Machina and of course, with the

00:27:52.589 --> 00:28:01.401
help of Vox Machina's leader, myself. Therefore,
I'm here to commission a humble portrait of

00:28:01.401 --> 00:28:10.311
myself. You may not know him, but there was a folk
hero in my town growing up. His name was Fabio. He

00:28:10.311 --> 00:28:18.548
would frequently pose with windblown hair and an
open shirt on a horse. I was thinking something

00:28:18.548 --> 00:28:24.391
like that, and also I have this figure of Pike.
She's a friend of mine. I'd like her on the back

00:28:24.391 --> 00:28:30.816
of the horse, arms around my waist, looking super
hot. If that's possible.

00:28:30.816 --> 00:28:39.442
MATT: Make a persuasion check. Only because he's
so down on his own skills.

00:28:39.442 --> 00:28:40.549
SAM: 33.

00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:42.227
(laughter)

00:28:42.227 --> 00:28:49.133
MATT: As you're telling this tale, he goes from
bashful and meek to staring off in the distance,

00:28:49.133 --> 00:28:51.665
the artistic inspiration rolling through his
head.

00:28:51.665 --> 00:28:56.342
SAM: Oh. Sorry, 31. I was wrong.

00:28:56.342 --> 00:29:02.179
MATT: Unchanged. He begins finishing your
sentences as you're describing scenery and

00:29:02.179 --> 00:29:05.903
extrapolating on it. You can see the artistic mind
is definitely spinning. He looks to you and goes,

00:29:05.903 --> 00:29:11.709
"It would be my honor. Please." He reaches forward
and takes your gnomish hand and you know, you're

00:29:11.709 --> 00:29:16.428
about two and a half feet shorter than him, but
he's still very humble, kneels down and says,

00:29:16.428 --> 00:29:20.723
"I would be honored to do this portrait. 
No charge."

00:29:20.723 --> 00:29:24.658
SAM: Please, I insist. I must give you something
for your troubles.

00:29:24.658 --> 00:29:28.568
MATT: "Whatever you deem fit, Sir Gnome, but I--"

00:29:28.568 --> 00:29:31.338
SAM: What's your name, young sir?

00:29:31.338 --> 00:29:32.433
MATT: "Jameson."

00:29:32.433 --> 00:29:33.441
SAM: Jameson?

00:29:33.441 --> 00:29:36.051
LIAM: I like him.

00:29:36.051 --> 00:29:37.154
SAM: I like this guy.

00:29:37.154 --> 00:29:40.390
TRAVIS: I think everybody does-- until they
don't.

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:51.907
SAM: How about in return, I will sing your praises
far and wide as the greatest artist in-- where are

00:29:51.907 --> 00:29:56.670
we? Whitestone. Whiteheart. Briarstone.
Heartwood.

00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:06.339
MATT: In making that mention, his openness
suddenly closes off and he withdraws. You see this

00:30:06.339 --> 00:30:15.171
fear in his eyes and he shakes his head. "That
would be untrue and I am but a simple stablehand.

00:30:15.171 --> 00:30:18.523
"I can do this for you, but please, if you could
keep this between us."

00:30:18.523 --> 00:30:23.963
SAM: All right. I'm aware that some people like to
be discreet about things and that's all right with

00:30:23.963 --> 00:30:29.160
me, too. Then I'll pay you the going rate for
portraits of me.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.313
MATT: "Certainly. How large would you like it?"

00:30:32.313 --> 00:30:35.844
SAM: How big is the wall at Greystone Keep?

00:30:35.844 --> 00:30:37.193
MATT: Depends on which area.

00:30:37.193 --> 00:30:39.753
SAM: The dining room wall.

00:30:39.753 --> 00:30:43.718
TRAVIS: (laughing) That's like Sistine Chapel!

00:30:43.718 --> 00:30:47.950
MATT: Your dining area's probably about 12 to 15
feet high.

00:30:48.143 --> 00:30:50.591
SAM: High? Okay, and wide?

00:30:50.591 --> 00:30:56.147
MATT: Wide? I'd say, off the top of my head,
somewhere between 40 and 50 feet.

00:30:56.147 --> 00:31:05.822
SAM: Well, I'd like to leave room for other
artwork, as well. We'll say 20 by six.

00:31:05.822 --> 00:31:09.452
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laughing) 20 by six?

00:31:09.452 --> 00:31:14.349
SAM: Well, it's half and half. 20 wide, six high.

00:31:14.349 --> 00:31:21.592
MATT: His eyes go wide and he nods and says, "This
is a challenge. But I believe I do know someone

00:31:21.689 --> 00:31:28.508
"whom I can order such a grand canvas from. This
can be done. This can be done." And you see he

00:31:28.508 --> 00:31:31.533
smiles and takes your hand once again. "This can
be done."

00:31:31.533 --> 00:31:33.448
SAM: Thank you, sir. Jameson, was it?

00:31:33.448 --> 00:31:34.482
MATT: "Jameson, yes."

00:31:34.482 --> 00:31:40.429
SAM: You have done a noble deed for your people
and for the rebel forces.

00:31:40.429 --> 00:31:42.780
MATT: "Eclipsed by the deeds you have done, Sir
Gnome."

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.406
SAM: Oh, that is true.

00:31:44.406 --> 00:31:46.889
(laughter)

00:31:46.889 --> 00:31:48.583
MATT: He rushes off to prepare himself.

00:31:48.583 --> 00:31:55.507
SAM: And then, one last thing. On a serious note,
I do some research to see if me, or any one of my

00:31:55.507 --> 00:32:04.326
party could, over time and with great effort,
learn the skills required to utilize a

00:32:04.326 --> 00:32:06.356
teleportation circle.

00:32:06.356 --> 00:32:08.598
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an arcana check.

00:32:08.598 --> 00:32:15.584
SAM: Not great. Arcana? 11.

00:32:15.584 --> 00:32:20.130
MATT: Yeah. What little you know of
teleportation-based magics, which is not your

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:24.591
forte in your bardic experiences, but what you've
heard and what you've seen, while you've traveled

00:32:24.591 --> 00:32:27.679
with Tiberius, and you've come across other
individuals that used the arcane spells that

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:35.547
caused transport, teleportation circles themselves
are a very specific ritual. It's a spell that

00:32:35.547 --> 00:32:41.198
comes from within the arcane caster's capabilities.
If you yourself do not have that, you're not going

00:32:41.317 --> 00:32:43.489
to be able to utilize it at a drop of a hat.

00:32:43.489 --> 00:32:49.559
After asking around, you find there once was a
teleportation destination circle in Castle

00:32:49.559 --> 00:32:54.343
Whitestone that was part of the network of
Tal'Dorei, in Emon, but has since been destroyed

00:32:54.343 --> 00:32:58.051
and sundered and has been for quite some time. You
imagine probably when the Briarwoods came, it was

00:32:58.051 --> 00:33:06.590
deemed a dangerous little loose thread. So, over
the period of the next week or so, best you can

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:11.549
ascertain is that type of transportation here is
going to be probably not likely, at least not with

00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:13.845
the resources you have at your disposal. You may
have to travel elsewhere.

00:33:13.845 --> 00:33:15.433
SAM: It's not a skill I can learn?

00:33:15.433 --> 00:33:19.181
MATT: It's a spell you could learn, but that would
be something you would have to swap out as you

00:33:19.181 --> 00:33:21.802
level up or choose as your spell progression down
the road.

00:33:21.802 --> 00:33:22.684
SAM: All right.

00:33:22.684 --> 00:33:26.281
LIAM: I find it's better to travel the world
rather than use fast travel.

00:33:26.281 --> 00:33:28.544
LAURA: I agree. You see so much more of it.

00:33:28.544 --> 00:33:29.855
LIAM: You miss everything.

00:33:29.855 --> 00:33:30.798
LAURA: Yeah.

00:33:30.798 --> 00:33:32.004
MARISHA: All the artistic--

00:33:32.004 --> 00:33:34.245
LIAM: Every nook and cranny, yeah.

00:33:34.245 --> 00:33:37.342
MATT: But you do, as part of your group's
discussions throughout the week, discover that

00:33:37.342 --> 00:33:41.664
Keyleth does have long-transport capabilities.

00:33:41.664 --> 00:33:45.017
SAM: Ooh, hello Keyleth. Fly the friendly skies.

00:33:45.017 --> 00:33:48.178
MATT: You want to explain what you can do?

00:33:48.178 --> 00:33:54.721
MARISHA: I have Teleport via Plants. So I can bamf
through the Sun Tree. We can all--

00:33:54.721 --> 00:33:56.531
SAM: We can all?

00:33:56.531 --> 00:33:57.699
MARISHA: We can all.

00:33:57.699 --> 00:33:59.445
LIAM: You mean like a big plant?

00:33:59.445 --> 00:34:00.858
MATT: It opens for six seconds, a portal--

00:34:00.858 --> 00:34:06.788
MARISHA: For one round, I can be like, this tree
is a portal and we walk through the tree and it

00:34:06.788 --> 00:34:10.230
goes to another tree as long as I know of
that tree's existence.

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:13.025
LAURA: And it's the same size, right? It has to be
something of the same size?

00:34:13.025 --> 00:34:14.076
Or it can be any tree?

00:34:14.076 --> 00:34:16.560
MARISHA: It has to be walkable body-size.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.351
MATT: A large or larger tree as far as this size.

00:34:20.351 --> 00:34:22.428
LAURA: Trinket and Grog-sized trees.

00:34:22.428 --> 00:34:26.117
SAM: That sounds like it would be the quickest
"root" to go.

00:34:26.117 --> 00:34:27.762
TALIESIN: (groans)

00:34:27.762 --> 00:34:33.248
LIAM: Is there a tree in your garden back at
Greyskull?

00:34:33.248 --> 00:34:36.089
MARISHA: There is. I made sure there was a nice--

00:34:36.089 --> 00:34:37.980
LAURA: Big old fatty tree.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.466
MARISHA: Big old fatty oak tree.

00:34:39.466 --> 00:34:47.865
MATT: There's actually two large trees, I
believe, in the Sarenrae temple.

00:34:47.865 --> 00:34:52.716
LAURA: I forgot to say what else I wanted to do.

00:34:52.716 --> 00:34:54.246
MATT: What else do you want to do?

00:34:54.246 --> 00:34:58.561
LAURA: Well, because of that flying potion, I
wanted to try to do some research and see how much

00:34:58.561 --> 00:35:02.735
flying potions are, if there's any kind of items
that can make you fly whenever you want?

00:35:02.735 --> 00:35:05.364
TRAVIS: She liked it.

00:35:05.364 --> 00:35:06.957
LAURA: I really liked it.

00:35:06.984 --> 00:35:10.399
MATT: (laughs) The first taste is free.

00:35:10.399 --> 00:35:16.051
LAURA: I know. I mean, I know the carpet's gone,
but maybe there's like an individual sort of item

00:35:16.051 --> 00:35:20.860
that's less expensive than a flying carpet, I
don't know. Just wondering.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:24.256
MATT: You still have the flying potion--

00:35:24.256 --> 00:35:26.034
LAURA: I downed it!

00:35:26.034 --> 00:35:30.916
MATT: Right, the card I gave you for it. Because
that would contain

00:35:30.916 --> 00:35:32.658
the cost of that particular one.

00:35:32.658 --> 00:35:33.765
LAURA: Oh.

00:35:33.765 --> 00:35:34.979
TRAVIS: 5,250.

00:35:34.979 --> 00:35:36.303
LIAM: You have a robe.

00:35:36.303 --> 00:35:38.202
LAURA: Well, but I want a bunch of them, though.

00:35:38.202 --> 00:35:42.867
MATT: Which you can have made or possibly look
about to have purchased. This town is pretty thin

00:35:42.867 --> 00:35:43.882
as far as--

00:35:43.882 --> 00:35:44.768
LAURA: Magic stuff?

00:35:44.768 --> 00:35:50.296
MATT: Yeah. Most of anything of worth, of an
arcane nature was confiscated and utilized or

00:35:50.296 --> 00:35:54.892
essentially melted down for its residuum
components as part of the creation of the

00:35:54.892 --> 00:35:59.049
ziggurat, in preparation for their ritual. So,
other than the items you were given when you first

00:35:59.049 --> 00:36:04.100
arrived here, you're hard-pressed to find anything
in this town of that type. But asking around,

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:09.870
there are enchantments that can gift flight, but
they're pretty rare.

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:11.023
LAURA: Okay.

00:36:11.023 --> 00:36:13.095
LIAM: Talk to Gilmore.

00:36:13.095 --> 00:36:17.701
MATT: Gilmore would be the person to talk to about
that. You good, Scanlan?

00:36:17.701 --> 00:36:18.984
SAM: Oh, I'm good.

00:36:18.984 --> 00:36:20.283
MATT: All right. Keyleth?

00:36:20.283 --> 00:36:26.222
MARISHA: Well, Keyleth is very confused as to why
everyone seems to be avoiding each other. It's

00:36:26.222 --> 00:36:35.587
odd. Everyone's so standoffish. Anyway, Keyleth is
going to go help the farmers and try and maybe

00:36:35.587 --> 00:36:45.593
help revitalize some of the land and help with
planting crops, and helping out there. She also

00:36:45.593 --> 00:36:54.177
wants to make sure all the local kids are taken
care of. Any kids that lost their parents in the

00:36:54.177 --> 00:36:58.715
rebellion. Lead the charge of making sure the kids
are taken care of.

00:36:58.715 --> 00:37:05.918
MATT: Okay. Going around, there were a number of
casualties in the town as part of the rebellion.

00:37:05.918 --> 00:37:12.493
It unfortunately happens in warfare, regardless of
how noble a cause it may be. There are a few

00:37:12.493 --> 00:37:18.829
families that were left fatherless or motherless,
as there was quite a share of the sexes raising up

00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:25.618
for this battle. So the children that-- no one
that you know of lost both parents, for the most

00:37:25.618 --> 00:37:30.376
part. There was the intent that if there were a
parental unit, that at least one had to stay in

00:37:30.376 --> 00:37:35.680
case of such an occurrence to raise the children.
But you go out and meet with some of the families

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.508
and make sure they're taken care of.

00:37:38.508 --> 00:37:41.300
Some of the homes that were destroyed as part of
the rebellion, you and Grog both worked together

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:50.164
to help make sure the process of rebuilding goes
well. You do also help the farmers begin to right

00:37:50.164 --> 00:37:55.422
their crops and revitalize the land, which had
been drained by the necromantic essence of the

00:37:55.422 --> 00:37:59.241
Briarwoods' presence, and whatever the ziggurat
was pulling from the land itself beneath seems to

00:37:59.241 --> 00:38:08.296
have released its hold on the immediate vicinity.
So, through your aid specifically, being a druid

00:38:08.296 --> 00:38:13.910
of your nature, you prepare this for probably one
of the finest harvests that Whitestone has had in

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:19.184
quite a long time. Even though it is deep winter,
they're already seeing early spring growth through

00:38:19.184 --> 00:38:20.835
your aid.

00:38:20.835 --> 00:38:24.219
MARISHA: Dope. Climate change.

00:38:24.219 --> 00:38:30.517
MATT: I know, it's crazy. Vegetation and
vegetables that are withstanding and still able to

00:38:30.517 --> 00:38:34.867
grow through the frost in the mornings, as the
cold weather is coming from the winter, so you're

00:38:34.867 --> 00:38:39.266
raising quite a strong crop. Well done.

00:38:39.266 --> 00:38:42.120
MARISHA: We'll have Thanksgiving in about nine
months.

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.986
MATT: (laughs) There you go.

00:38:44.986 --> 00:38:46.447
TALIESIN: For the orphans, man.

00:38:46.447 --> 00:38:47.551
MARISHA: For the orphans.

00:38:47.551 --> 00:38:48.809
MATT: Percival?

00:38:48.809 --> 00:39:00.313
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to spend most of my time
organizing the affairs of the castle and the local

00:39:00.313 --> 00:39:06.913
government and making sure that there's
institutions in place, getting rid of anybody who

00:39:06.913 --> 00:39:11.771
might still have sympathies towards the
Briarwoods. Helping re-establish the

00:39:11.771 --> 00:39:16.576
Zenith and the Ladies' Chamber. Spending some time
with my sister.

00:39:16.576 --> 00:39:26.823
MATT: On that note, before you continue, there is
no current institution in place. Anyone of any

00:39:26.823 --> 00:39:35.777
political power outside of Archibald, you, and
Cassandra, has been slaughtered long past. So in

00:39:35.777 --> 00:39:40.412
these discussions, you talk with Keeper Yennen,
you talk to Cassandra, and there is an air of

00:39:40.412 --> 00:39:44.847
understanding that right now, there is this period
of peace, this period of calm, but there has to

00:39:44.847 --> 00:39:49.904
eventually be an establishment put into place:
some sort of political head to oversee the

00:39:49.904 --> 00:39:54.455
rebuilding of the city and the continued growth
and survival of this town proper.

00:39:54.455 --> 00:40:04.311
Cassandra confides in you multiple times that she
is nervous, that she, especially given recent

00:40:04.311 --> 00:40:11.736
circumstances, her recovery of her Stockholm
syndrome with the Briarwoods, is not confident

00:40:11.736 --> 00:40:20.039
that she would be able to lead on her own. There
is a moment where she apologizes extensively to

00:40:20.039 --> 00:40:26.280
Archibald. Archibald, who did survive, and was her
direct contact in the castle, takes a few days

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:30.762
before he will even face Cassandra when he is told
that she essentially had been leading him astray

00:40:30.762 --> 00:40:36.553
and spearheading the death of the previous
rebellion. You also discover the reason the

00:40:36.553 --> 00:40:42.845
various new nobles that were prepared for your
ambushes were because Cassandra had gotten

00:40:42.845 --> 00:40:47.845
information about that from Archibald and then fed
it to the Briarwoods. But you do sense a very,

00:40:47.845 --> 00:40:55.169
very deep-seated regret and an urge to make amends
for that from her. And because of that

00:40:55.169 --> 00:40:59.918
circumstance, she doesn't feel like the people of
Whitestone, who would have this information, which

00:40:59.918 --> 00:41:03.777
you haven't told anyone. There is no large-scale
announcement. The only people that know about

00:41:03.777 --> 00:41:11.211
Cassandra's current situation with the Briarwoods
are you guys, Keeper Yennen, and Archibald.

00:41:11.211 --> 00:41:13.202
SAM: Archibald's still around?

00:41:13.202 --> 00:41:14.428
MATT: He is.

00:41:14.428 --> 00:41:15.777
SAM: And he betrayed us?

00:41:15.777 --> 00:41:17.168
LAURA and MARISHA: No.

00:41:17.168 --> 00:41:18.858
LAURA: Cassandra betrayed him.

00:41:18.858 --> 00:41:20.305
LIAM: Cassandra played everybody.

00:41:20.305 --> 00:41:23.480
SAM: Oh. All right, I'll let him live.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:28.015
LAURA: Thank you, glorious leader. Thank you.

00:41:28.015 --> 00:41:30.418
SAM: Just part of the team, guys.

00:41:30.418 --> 00:41:36.607
MATT: So that is an ongoing discussion. As far as
establishing the structure, there's been many

00:41:36.747 --> 00:41:40.465
talks, but nothing has been fine-tuned, and that
may play itself out as part of the festival.

00:41:40.508 --> 00:41:47.021
TALIESIN: I have two items that I would like to
look at. Well, I have three items that I would

00:41:47.021 --> 00:41:51.672
like to look at. Sylas's sword and his amulet.

00:41:51.672 --> 00:41:55.616
MATT: Okay. The brooch that he left behind.

00:41:55.616 --> 00:41:56.874
TALIESIN: Brooch!

00:41:56.874 --> 00:41:58.607
MATT: Travis has got you.

00:41:58.607 --> 00:41:59.781
TALIESIN: Really, Travis?

00:41:59.781 --> 00:42:01.199
LAURA: He's our runner.

00:42:01.199 --> 00:42:04.881
LIAM: Oh, ho ho ho, and all of that!

00:42:04.881 --> 00:42:06.791
LAURA: What is it?

00:42:06.791 --> 00:42:08.151
MARISHA: What is it, what is it?

00:42:08.151 --> 00:42:09.151
TALIESIN: Damn.

00:42:09.151 --> 00:42:10.670
LAURA: Is it amazing?

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:12.932
LIAM: He's standing there like Guile before a
Street Fighter match.

00:42:12.932 --> 00:42:15.762
MATT: He hasn't heard of that character.

00:42:15.762 --> 00:42:21.073
LAURA: (laughs) What is it? What do you have?

00:42:21.073 --> 00:42:30.210
TALIESIN: I don't know, it's a piece of paper.
It's pretty cool. It's called a Brooch of Living

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:37.632
Essence and it basically masks the wearer's
alignment, essence, whether they're good or evil,

00:42:37.674 --> 00:42:40.381
they can't be seen by Detect Magic spells.

00:42:40.381 --> 00:42:42.288
LIAM: That is the worst thing for you.

00:42:42.288 --> 00:42:44.614
LAURA: Not anymore!

00:42:44.614 --> 00:42:45.879
TALIESIN: Is it?

00:42:45.879 --> 00:42:49.091
LIAM: I'm unsure. It's hard to tell.

00:42:49.091 --> 00:42:54.561
MATT: You gather that this item in particular was
used by Sylas to travel through magically

00:42:54.561 --> 00:43:00.896
protected areas without giving up his undead
essence or being read for his true intentions.

00:43:00.896 --> 00:43:07.054
MARISHA: It's for a shifty bastard. It's
definitely a shifty bastard thing.

00:43:07.054 --> 00:43:08.726
LAURA: It's for Scanlan.

00:43:08.726 --> 00:43:10.543
SAM: Oh, me? My alignment's good.

00:43:10.591 --> 00:43:14.284
MARISHA: Yeah, but it could be good if you want to
pretend to be evil.

00:43:14.284 --> 00:43:19.565
TALIESIN: Either this or Vax. This would be an
interesting thing for either--

00:43:19.565 --> 00:43:26.178
MARISHA: It doesn't protect you against Detect
Magic spells. It protects you against Detect Good

00:43:26.178 --> 00:43:29.863
or Evil spells and magic spells that reveal your
true nature.

00:43:29.863 --> 00:43:32.266
SAM: True nature.

00:43:32.266 --> 00:43:34.518
LIAM: It would be a good thing.

00:43:34.518 --> 00:43:36.231
LAURA: So you could pretend to be bad.

00:43:36.231 --> 00:43:41.915
TALIESIN: What do you have in your-- brooch?

00:43:41.915 --> 00:43:43.591
LIAM: My brooch?

00:43:43.591 --> 00:43:44.701
MATT: It's in the neck slot.

00:43:44.701 --> 00:43:46.805
LIAM: Nothing.

00:43:46.805 --> 00:43:48.257
TALIESIN: Nothing in your neck slot?

00:43:48.257 --> 00:43:50.100
LAURA: That sounds so disgusting.

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:54.946
LIAM: My neck slot (laughs). I don't know, Percy.
What have I got in my neck slot?

00:43:54.946 --> 00:44:04.585
MATT: You see the brooch slowly press deep in his
neck slot (laughs). God. Ugh. Don't turn that into

00:44:04.585 --> 00:44:06.645
any fan fiction, please.

00:44:06.645 --> 00:44:08.072
TALIESIN: Don't say that!

00:44:08.072 --> 00:44:09.758
MATT: I know. Percy, what else?

00:44:09.758 --> 00:44:10.748
TALIESIN: The sword.

00:44:10.748 --> 00:44:11.856
MATT: The sword.

00:44:11.856 --> 00:44:15.282
SAM: That is a big piece of paper.

00:44:15.282 --> 00:44:18.547
LIAM: That's a rather big piece of paper for a
sword.

00:44:18.547 --> 00:44:21.796
TALIESIN: And Ripley's gun.

00:44:21.796 --> 00:44:30.210
MATT: Well, first, as you take the sword in your
hands, the large, thick obsidian, onyx black blade.

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:37.722
You take a while to, not necessarily attune to it,
but put enough of your attention towards it where

00:44:37.722 --> 00:44:49.093
you sense its magical capabilities. As it begins to
clarify, where one voice before was not there, a

00:44:49.135 --> 00:44:51.198
new voice speaks and says--

00:44:51.198 --> 00:44:52.355
MARISHA: Wait!

00:44:52.355 --> 00:44:55.411
LIAM: (shushing noises) This is important.

00:44:55.411 --> 00:44:57.267
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

00:44:57.267 --> 00:45:00.427
MATT: "You, are you my new wielder?"

00:45:00.427 --> 00:45:01.657
LAURA: What?

00:45:01.657 --> 00:45:03.186
SAM: He's got a talking sword!

00:45:03.186 --> 00:45:05.323
MARISHA: What's with you and fucking weapons,
man?

00:45:05.323 --> 00:45:11.543
TALIESIN: (whimpers)

00:45:11.543 --> 00:45:13.886
LAURA: Be strong, Percy!

00:45:13.886 --> 00:45:18.185
LIAM: You're not here.

00:45:18.185 --> 00:45:19.416
TALIESIN: No.

00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:22.160
(laughter)

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:25.357
MATT: "Then leave me until one worthy lifts this
blade."

00:45:25.357 --> 00:45:27.128
TALIESIN: I'm going to gently put it down.

00:45:27.128 --> 00:45:29.143
MATT: Okay.

00:45:29.143 --> 00:45:31.559
MARISHA: This is a sword that has a name!

00:45:31.559 --> 00:45:37.795
TALIESIN: I don't know what to do about this
(laughs). This is really disturbing.

00:45:37.826 --> 00:45:43.052
MATT: As you step away from the blade, you can
feel the air nearby is generally colder in its

00:45:43.052 --> 00:45:49.631
presence, and where previously it was just a
weapon, you can almost feel like there's something

00:45:49.631 --> 00:45:54.737
looking at you. There's a presence just bent
towards you, expectantly.

00:45:54.737 --> 00:45:56.240
LAURA: That's creepy!

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.206
TALIESIN: (whimpers)

00:45:58.206 --> 00:46:00.663
SAM: Just try it out! What could go wrong?

00:46:00.663 --> 00:46:03.308
LIAM: Do you want to become evil, Grog?

00:46:03.308 --> 00:46:05.241
TRAVIS: I can tame it.

00:46:05.241 --> 00:46:09.284
TALIESIN: (laughs) Wow--

00:46:09.284 --> 00:46:10.971
LIAM: Don't do it, Percy.

00:46:10.971 --> 00:46:15.193
TRAVIS: What does it say?

00:46:15.193 --> 00:46:17.384
LAURA and SAM: What does it say?

00:46:17.384 --> 00:46:19.621
TALIESIN: I don't think I should tell any of you.

00:46:19.621 --> 00:46:26.854
MATT: The blade sits there on the ground where you leave
it, whatever you wish to do with it.

00:46:26.886 --> 00:46:31.709
TRAVIS: Do you want to put it in the Bag?

00:46:31.709 --> 00:46:36.674
TALIESIN: God, you've given me so much to think
about. It's really unfortunate. I'm definitely

00:46:36.674 --> 00:46:39.281
going to take at least a week of our two weeks to
think about the sword.

00:46:39.281 --> 00:46:41.917
MATT: Okay. What are you going to do with it in
the meantime?

00:46:41.917 --> 00:46:43.283
LIAM: Sleep on top of it.

00:46:43.283 --> 00:46:45.819
TALIESIN: Sleep on top of it. It's in my room.

00:46:45.819 --> 00:46:47.346
TRAVIS: You don't want it in the Bag?

00:46:47.346 --> 00:46:49.069
TALIESIN: No.

00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:54.471
MATT: So, for each evening as you lay down to
sleep, you can feel a voice creep back in to say--

00:46:54.471 --> 00:47:10.552
The voice is inquisitive. "I'm useless left here.
I seek the thrill of battle. I'm hungry." Other

00:47:10.552 --> 00:47:19.491
evenings, it comes to you, almost pleading. "Why
have you forsaken me? You took me as a trophy.

00:47:19.491 --> 00:47:26.658
"What purpose has a blade that goes unused? I will
remember this."

00:47:26.658 --> 00:47:30.777
Then it falls silent after a few days.

00:47:30.777 --> 00:47:33.221
TRAVIS: The silent treatment.

00:47:33.221 --> 00:47:35.489
LAURA: It's sulking.

00:47:35.489 --> 00:47:40.328
TALIESIN: Is it a two-handed sword or a
one-handed sword?

00:47:40.328 --> 00:47:46.331
MATT: It's a greatsword. It's two-handed, big old
Final Fantasy 7 sword.

00:47:46.366 --> 00:47:49.007
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

00:47:49.007 --> 00:47:52.720
SAM: Evil Grog is not a good idea.

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.393
MARISHA: This is the thing that's fucked up.

00:47:55.393 --> 00:48:03.768
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, which is why I shouldn't
have given him that brooch. Goddamn it. I may ask

00:48:03.768 --> 00:48:05.985
for that brooch back.

00:48:05.985 --> 00:48:07.209
LIAM: You can certainly try.

00:48:07.209 --> 00:48:08.275
TALIESIN: God damn it.

00:48:08.275 --> 00:48:10.155
TRAVIS: (laughs) Whoa.

00:48:10.155 --> 00:48:15.582
MATT: So, as you think on it, the weeks pass--

00:48:15.582 --> 00:48:17.918
TALIESIN: No, I had a--

00:48:17.918 --> 00:48:19.386
MATT: Oh, what did you guys want to do?

00:48:19.386 --> 00:48:22.981
TALIESIN: I also wanted to work on Ripley's gun.

00:48:22.981 --> 00:48:29.697
MATT: Right. The gun itself is essentially a
baseline pistol. If you look in your archetype for

00:48:29.697 --> 00:48:34.976
your fighter class of gunslinger, the pistol
mechanics all apply to that weapon. Beyond that,

00:48:34.976 --> 00:48:38.762
nothing in particular. It's just her first
successful attempt in recreating a firearm.

00:48:38.762 --> 00:48:46.027
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to start making some
ammo for it. And I'm going to work on it.

00:48:46.027 --> 00:48:47.152
MATT: Okay.

00:48:47.152 --> 00:48:51.886
LAURA: Percy, whenever you get a chance, could you,
maybe-- how hard are those exploding arrows to

00:48:51.934 --> 00:48:55.111
make? Super-duper hard?

00:48:55.111 --> 00:49:00.763
TALIESIN: Not terribly difficult. I don't think
it's in two weeks, but when we go home, I'll work

00:49:00.763 --> 00:49:18.527
on it. I know, I like them too... I hate you.
You're a terrible person.

00:49:18.527 --> 00:49:20.986
MATT: You picked up the sword, man.

00:49:20.986 --> 00:49:22.768
TRAVIS: Percy, how's that sword working out?

00:49:22.768 --> 00:49:23.997
TALIESIN: It's a little big, actually.

00:49:23.997 --> 00:49:28.203
TRAVIS: Is it? Look, I have this one-handed
Dragonslayer Longsword if you want to get used to

00:49:28.203 --> 00:49:33.499
a bit of badassery before you move up to the big
leagues. I know you've got that dinky piece of

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:35.004
shit you've been using this whole time.

00:49:35.004 --> 00:49:40.027
MATT: Just as a note, too, a greatsword is a
strength-based melee weapon. Dex does not play

00:49:40.027 --> 00:49:40.869
into it.

00:49:40.869 --> 00:49:42.476
TALIESIN: Oh, which is-- well, yeah.

00:49:42.476 --> 00:49:47.413
MATT: Based on whatever your strength is. What's
your strength, Percy?

00:49:47.413 --> 00:49:49.250
TALIESIN: Strength is 12.

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:53.100
MATT: You would probably not do very well with
that.

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:57.655
TALIESIN: Which is why I was thinking about having it
cut down and melted down into something more

00:49:57.795 --> 00:49:58.841
useful.

00:49:58.841 --> 00:50:00.502
MATT: This is also viable, if you wanted to try.

00:50:00.502 --> 00:50:07.284
TRAVIS: (whispering) Dragon-slayer Longsword.

00:50:07.284 --> 00:50:15.665
TALIESIN: You know, this is actually pretty badass
if I did give it to Grog. Yeah.

00:50:15.665 --> 00:50:17.084
TRAVIS: Trade!

00:50:17.084 --> 00:50:21.809
MARISHA: Jesus Christ! And he's not even going to
say anything about it. You're a terrible person,

00:50:21.809 --> 00:50:28.527
not Matt, you are. He gave you the device and you
used it!

00:50:28.527 --> 00:50:32.358
LIAM: You've been playing D&amp;amp;D for years. You know
what this means!

00:50:32.411 --> 00:50:35.741
TALIESIN: I'm going to let you know we should keep
an eye on him, just in case.

00:50:35.741 --> 00:50:43.997
MATT: So, Grog. As you take up the blade in your
hands, you hear coming out of the ether, a gentle,

00:50:44.044 --> 00:50:51.738
low velvet voice caresses the inside of your head
saying, "You, are you to be my wielder?"

00:50:51.738 --> 00:50:53.744
TRAVIS: What the shit?

00:50:53.744 --> 00:50:58.115
MATT: "Speak your name, warrior."

00:50:58.115 --> 00:51:01.740
TRAVIS: Grog.

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:07.839
MATT: "Warrior Grog, have you taken up the blade
of Craven Edge?"

00:51:07.839 --> 00:51:14.214
TRAVIS: Is that what this is? Do you have a female
setting?

00:51:14.214 --> 00:51:17.801
(laughter)

00:51:17.801 --> 00:51:31.488
MATT: You hear a long, drawn-out sigh. "Do you
accept my power?"

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:38.276
TRAVIS: There's a power that comes with you? What
kind of power?

00:51:38.317 --> 00:51:44.731
MATT: "Do you enjoy drinking the strength of your
foes, watching them beaten before you, and have

00:51:44.731 --> 00:51:48.901
"that very power become your own?"

00:51:48.901 --> 00:51:50.470
TRAVIS: Sounds pretty good.

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:56.340
MATT: "Do you wish the shadows to encase your form
and grant you resilience and anger, forcing those

00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:59.013
"to kneel before you in fear."

00:51:59.013 --> 00:52:01.392
TRAVIS: The shadows?

00:52:01.392 --> 00:52:08.751
MATT: "Do you accept, Grog?"

00:52:08.837 --> 00:52:10.024
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah.

00:52:10.024 --> 00:52:15.331
(laughter)

00:52:15.331 --> 00:52:19.767
MATT: "Then it is done. Together, we will
accomplish great things."

00:52:19.767 --> 00:52:27.174
TRAVIS: Do you have a name? Do I call upon you?
Can I call you Bacon?

00:52:27.174 --> 00:52:33.796
MATT: "You call me Bacon and this blade will cut
the very hand you hold. My name is Craven Edge. It

00:52:33.796 --> 00:52:35.820
"will do you well to remember that."

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:42.401
TRAVIS: Right. Yep. Was totally kidding about the
bacon, Craven Edge. Well, I'm excited about this

00:52:42.401 --> 00:52:49.508
partnership. Clearly we will be a force to be
reckoned with. By the way,

00:52:49.508 --> 00:52:53.458
can other people hear you?

00:52:53.458 --> 00:52:54.694
MATT: Silence.

00:52:54.694 --> 00:53:00.435
TRAVIS: Shit.

00:53:00.435 --> 00:53:02.879
LIAM: He will kill me first.

00:53:02.879 --> 00:53:04.775
TALIESIN: It is an amazing sword.

00:53:04.775 --> 00:53:06.185
TRAVIS: I haven't even read it yet.

00:53:06.185 --> 00:53:07.301
TALIESIN: You haven't read it yet?

00:53:07.301 --> 00:53:08.890
TRAVIS: No. I can't read!

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:12.158
(laughter)

00:53:12.158 --> 00:53:14.511
LAURA: I want to read it so bad!

00:53:14.511 --> 00:53:15.945
LIAM: Don't let anybody read it.

00:53:15.945 --> 00:53:17.599
TALIESIN: It's so magical.

00:53:17.599 --> 00:53:19.745
TRAVIS: Give me a bear cookie.

00:53:19.745 --> 00:53:26.055
MATT: You have a clue as to what it can do based
on when it was used against you by Sylas.

00:53:26.055 --> 00:53:28.357
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was badass. Thank you.

00:53:28.357 --> 00:53:34.392
MATT: So, anything else you want to accomplish
before we close out on the rest of the week?

00:53:34.442 --> 00:53:35.577
SAM: I had a question.

00:53:35.577 --> 00:53:36.410
MATT: Yes.

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:39.012
SAM: Did we assemble a team of magic--

00:53:39.012 --> 00:53:40.550
LAURA: To take care of the thingy?

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:43.751
MARISHA: Yeah, that we needed to-- we all need to
take care of that.

00:53:43.751 --> 00:53:45.285
LAURA: The marble of death?

00:53:45.285 --> 00:53:52.011
MATT: So, throughout the week, Keeper Yennen, a
few of the low-level arcanists that exist here--

00:53:52.011 --> 00:53:54.114
LAURA: Didn't we send for Eskil Ryndarien?

00:53:54.114 --> 00:53:58.323
MATT: You sent for him, but you know information
right now travels at the speed

00:53:58.323 --> 00:53:59.826
of whatever it is you--

00:53:59.826 --> 00:54:00.999
MARISHA: By mule?

00:54:00.999 --> 00:54:01.755
MATT: Yeah.

00:54:01.755 --> 00:54:03.067
TALIESIN: At speed of mule.

00:54:03.067 --> 00:54:14.179
MATT: The speed of that as it continues forward.
You get word back. Nothing from Allura Vysoren

00:54:14.179 --> 00:54:19.517
yet. Eskil does respond, saying he is currently
finishing up some personal business, but will make

00:54:19.517 --> 00:54:24.448
his way towards Whitestone within a couple
weeks, with some of his compatriots who may also

00:54:24.488 --> 00:54:30.598
be of aid. Information has been gotten across, but
it won't be until probably after this festival for

00:54:30.598 --> 00:54:32.252
them to begin their investigation.

00:54:32.252 --> 00:54:37.473
However, in the meantime, Keeper Yennen and a few
of the smaller local arcanists do make a couple

00:54:37.473 --> 00:54:43.668
trips down to inspect the ziggurat themselves.
When they return, Yennen is at a loss. Most of

00:54:43.668 --> 00:54:49.519
them don't quite understand the nature of the
magic there. It seems to be immobile. It seems to

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:59.389
be completely either negating, consuming, or
preventing any sort of magical force within a

00:54:59.389 --> 00:55:06.861
specific radius of it. A lot of their normal
arcane methods of inspecting or divine methods of

00:55:06.861 --> 00:55:14.833
inspecting this site are not functional. This is
more like bring old tomes and research historical

00:55:14.833 --> 00:55:18.926
records of things that may be similar to this. So
when you bring up that you had reached out to

00:55:18.926 --> 00:55:22.509
Eskil Ryndarien with the information you had, you
gather that will probably be a much more fruitful

00:55:22.509 --> 00:55:26.726
endeavor. As of right now, no one has any clue
what this is.

00:55:26.726 --> 00:55:32.520
LAURA: And we searched the Briarwoods' library
that they had gathered together that say anything

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:33.589
about--

00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:34.489
MATT: Yeah.

00:55:34.489 --> 00:55:35.574
LAURA: Okay.

00:55:35.574 --> 00:55:41.413
MATT: Some of the information you acquired from
Scanlan's memory and a little bit of research into

00:55:41.413 --> 00:55:49.586
Vecna. Very little information really exists, but
as the keeper of secrets, you get the sense that

00:55:49.586 --> 00:55:54.970
most anything of importance in dealing with this
ritual has been destroyed as part of its

00:55:54.970 --> 00:56:02.009
preparation because secrets are meant to be kept
and hoarded. So not much luck in that regard,

00:56:02.009 --> 00:56:10.326
unfortunately. However, as the second week draws
to a close, the Winter's Crest day comes forward.

00:56:10.364 --> 00:56:17.432
As the morning crests into the proper Winter's
Crest festival, you all awaken in Castle

00:56:17.432 --> 00:56:23.092
Whitestone to an unusually cold morning. As you
look out, there is a fresh dusting of white snow

00:56:23.092 --> 00:56:31.508
that has gently caressed the entirety of this
valley and the entire city itself. You all get

00:56:31.508 --> 00:56:36.545
yourselves ready, gather your belongings and
preparing for the festival you've been helping get

00:56:36.545 --> 00:56:39.925
ready this entire week, you walk down towards
Whitestone itself.

00:56:39.925 --> 00:56:46.514
As you get to the outskirts of the city, you can
already hear in the distance music beginning to

00:56:46.514 --> 00:56:51.187
play. Blue and white ribbons are hung up all
throughout the town, on the outside of buildings,

00:56:51.187 --> 00:56:57.023
outside of taverns, outside of even the remaining
wreckage that is only partially built. It seems

00:56:57.023 --> 00:57:03.460
that overnight, people just went through the town and
decorated whatever needed to be decorated to wipe

00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:09.791
clean the memory of the recent trials and
difficulty that everyone's undergone.

00:57:09.791 --> 00:57:14.552
You begin to make your way towards the center of
the town, to the town square where the Sun Tree

00:57:14.552 --> 00:57:19.081
is, and as you approach, you now see the source of
the music, as a number of individuals in the town

00:57:19.081 --> 00:57:22.745
have brought out their instruments. They're
playing, some more discordant than others, but

00:57:22.745 --> 00:57:27.330
overall, a sense of joy as people for the first
time in a long time are truly embracing this

00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:33.221
positive atmosphere. You see children laughing and
running through the streets. You can smell

00:57:33.221 --> 00:57:39.502
fresh-cooked pies and various bakery items just
filling the air around you. Looking over, as you

00:57:39.502 --> 00:57:45.112
approach the Sun Tree, you can see where once
bodies hung from its boughs, there now are strings

00:57:45.112 --> 00:57:49.442
of blue and white ribbons that are intertwined
with each other, braided and set across from

00:57:49.442 --> 00:57:54.322
branch to branch. You can see fine little glass
structures that have been hand blown and left to

00:57:54.322 --> 00:57:56.680
drape from them to be part of the festivities.

00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:01.963
As you begin to make your way up there,
immediately people begin to notice your presence,

00:58:01.963 --> 00:58:06.558
and you can see people in the streets begin to
gather up and begin cheering. You hear voices

00:58:06.558 --> 00:58:11.035
mutter out, "Vox Machina!" People start reaching
out and shaking your hands. "Thank you so much,

00:58:11.035 --> 00:58:15.434
"thank you." You're taken aback by the attention.
It's reminding you a little bit of the awkwardness

00:58:15.434 --> 00:58:17.620
you had with the last Winter's Crest in Emon.

00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:23.198
LAURA: Be on the lookout for eggs, giant
frosty-looking eggs.

00:58:23.241 --> 00:58:32.150
MATT: You make your way towards the Sun Tree and
there you see Keeper Yennen is in the process of

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:36.130
speaking with a few of the people that helped him
with this entire rebellion, in setting up this

00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:41.996
event, and he greets you all as you approach. "Oh,
my friends! How wondrous. Glad to see you are all

00:58:41.996 --> 00:58:44.325
"wakened and ready and well rested, I assume."

00:58:44.325 --> 00:58:45.547
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:58:45.547 --> 00:58:51.257
MATT: "Glorious. Well, this is a day of
celebration. We've taken the time and mourning

00:58:51.257 --> 00:58:59.781
"shall continue as needed, but today, today is to
embrace what it means to be alive, to thwart the

00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:05.077
"darkness and the evils that press upon the free
folk of these lands. And of course, to eat and

00:59:05.077 --> 00:59:07.245
"drink until you are full and drunk."

00:59:07.245 --> 00:59:08.776
(laughter)

00:59:08.776 --> 00:59:10.531
MARISHA: Cheers to that.

00:59:10.531 --> 00:59:17.252
MATT: "It will be a little bit before we get to the
actual celebration speech, but in the meantime, go

00:59:17.305 --> 00:59:22.441
"free yourselves, drink, be merry. There are a few
events going on around you." And he points in a

00:59:22.441 --> 00:59:25.975
few directions, and you can see around you there
are tables set up, there are individuals playing

00:59:25.975 --> 00:59:32.551
games. Immediately to the left, you can see there
are two long tables set up and a stack of pies off

00:59:32.551 --> 00:59:34.472
to one side, looks like an eating contest.

00:59:34.472 --> 00:59:36.884
TRAVIS: I haven't eaten for a full day.

00:59:36.884 --> 00:59:39.687
MARISHA: In preparation?

00:59:39.687 --> 00:59:40.711
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:59:40.711 --> 00:59:45.641
MATT: You do see what looks to be a gentleman with
a high box, with a very, very fine waxed mustache

00:59:45.641 --> 00:59:50.763
that is currently doing parlor tricks and magical
presentations for people who are trading coin to

00:59:50.763 --> 00:59:57.532
be astounded with his illusions. You can see what
looks to be a series of tables behind the Sun Tree

00:59:57.532 --> 01:00:04.077
heading towards the southeast side of it. You
recognize better than anyone: these are central

01:00:04.077 --> 01:00:07.328
tables, relatively small, with a chair on each
side.

01:00:07.328 --> 01:00:08.666
TRAVIS: Arm wrestling!

01:00:08.666 --> 01:00:12.433
(laughter)

01:00:12.433 --> 01:00:15.186
TRAVIS: Craven, I think-- oh wait, that's arm
wrestling. Go to sleep.

01:00:15.233 --> 01:00:20.600
MATT: The sigh is getting more and more
impatient.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.864
TRAVIS: He'll get used to that.

01:00:22.864 --> 01:00:29.041
MATT: So these are the three first events you come
across in your immediate vicinity. What would any

01:00:29.041 --> 01:00:31.188
of you guys like to partake in?

01:00:31.188 --> 01:00:35.923
MARISHA: I see the magic tricks and go (loud gasp)
and run over, without saying anything.

01:00:35.923 --> 01:00:36.821
SAM: I tag along.

01:00:36.821 --> 01:00:39.819
TALIESIN: Oh, I'll go in for this one as
well.

01:00:39.819 --> 01:00:40.712
MARISHA: Okay.

01:00:40.712 --> 01:00:43.519
MATT: As you guys rush forward, you come to the
box. It's a relatively high box. It looks like it

01:00:43.519 --> 01:00:48.071
hasn't seen some use in a while. The gentleman
sitting there, with longish hair, parted in the

01:00:48.071 --> 01:00:53.209
center, and combs outward. He's got a waxed
mustache. He's wearing dusty presentational

01:00:53.209 --> 01:00:59.571
robes and he has on the top of it a series of
small boxes and what looks like various tricks he

01:00:59.571 --> 01:01:05.171
has at the ready. There are three children off to
the side with either their keeper or parents

01:01:05.171 --> 01:01:14.575
behind. "Now watch, if you will, as this simple
ball transports itself between the cups and yet

01:01:14.575 --> 01:01:19.403
"find your eyes unable to follow." And he switches
the cups around for a moment. (whoosh)

01:01:19.403 --> 01:01:23.385
(laughter)

01:01:23.385 --> 01:01:27.300
MATT: "Where is the ball, little one?" The kids
deliberate and one goes, "That one!"

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:31.982
"Are you sure?" They all shake their head.

01:01:31.982 --> 01:01:38.051
"Oh! I'm sorry,
the ball has escaped your vision once again."

01:01:38.051 --> 01:01:40.759
And they all they cheer. He lifts the other one.

01:01:40.759 --> 01:01:49.541
MARISHA: (gasps), are you a wizard? We've met a
few wizards. No, are you a sorcerer? Because you

01:01:49.541 --> 01:01:53.175
don't look like a druid. This doesn't look like
natural magic. What?

01:01:53.175 --> 01:02:00.906
MATT: "I am what you refer to as an illusionist.
And I can play tricks on your mind, your mind,

01:02:00.906 --> 01:02:01.685
"your mind..."

01:02:01.685 --> 01:02:05.387
MARISHA: (shouting) No! God, we've been through
way too much of that here lately.

01:02:05.387 --> 01:02:06.921
SAM: It's entertainment.

01:02:06.921 --> 01:02:09.625
MATT: "Playful! Playful illusions, not
against..."

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:11.057
SAM: It's just a game.

01:02:11.057 --> 01:02:12.986
TALIESIN: Carry on. It's good. She's good.

01:02:12.986 --> 01:02:15.818
MATT: "Keep her in check, please. You're scaring
the children."

01:02:15.818 --> 01:02:20.076
SAM: It's not real. It's a game. It's going to be
fine.

01:02:20.076 --> 01:02:22.303
MARISHA: (whispers) Okay. I don't trust this guy.

01:02:22.303 --> 01:02:25.078
SAM: Don't worry. Why don't you have Percival take
the first turn?

01:02:25.078 --> 01:02:29.989
MATT: "I'm also a diviner. I can look into your
eyes and see your very future."

01:02:29.989 --> 01:02:31.571
TALIESIN: Not really. It's okay.

01:02:31.571 --> 01:02:38.078
MATT: "For a simple gold piece, you can test your
skills against the transference of this ethereal

01:02:38.078 --> 01:02:42.318
"ball. Or for five, I can look into your fate."

01:02:42.366 --> 01:02:45.483
MARISHA: (starts hyperventilating)

01:02:45.483 --> 01:02:47.236
TALIESIN: I'll do both, actually.

01:02:47.236 --> 01:02:51.105
MATT: "Ha ha. All right." Takes the gold piece.

01:02:51.105 --> 01:03:01.316
MARISHA: I grab him by the scruff and I say, if
you hurt him... You don't know what he's been

01:03:01.316 --> 01:03:02.732
through, okay?

01:03:02.732 --> 01:03:04.719
MATT: "It's fine. It's all right."

01:03:04.719 --> 01:03:09.174
MARISHA: Are you working with the Briarwoods? Did
the Briarwoods send you?!

01:03:09.174 --> 01:03:10.940
MATT: "Can you please get her off of me?"

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:18.146
SAM: Hey, kids, this is why you shouldn't drink
during the daytime.

01:03:18.146 --> 01:03:21.504
MATT: "Anyway."

01:03:21.618 --> 01:03:23.690
MARISHA: Do your magic.

01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:31.280
MATT: "So, sir." Takes one gold piece off,
sets it aside. "Now, the ethereal ball. This was

01:03:31.425 --> 01:03:39.440
"taken from the Far Realms themselves, crafted in
the ivy-covered hills in the far North End, the

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:45.739
"Feywild itself. How could you follow this, with
but your simple vision?" He places one cup over

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:49.572
it, two cups to the side and begins shifting and
shifting. Go ahead and make a perception check.

01:03:49.572 --> 01:03:52.025
MARISHA: Oh, him? Okay.

01:03:52.025 --> 01:03:57.696
TALIESIN: 20.

01:03:57.696 --> 01:04:06.945
MATT: You see now, there's a couple moments where
the ball shifts between cups and you get a really

01:04:06.945 --> 01:04:11.421
close idea of exactly how this works. And when he
finishes, he looks to you.

01:04:11.421 --> 01:04:14.792
"Now, where is the fey ball?"

01:04:14.792 --> 01:04:20.522
TALIESIN: I would say it's to your right, right
there.

01:04:20.522 --> 01:04:21.754
MATT: "That one?"

01:04:21.754 --> 01:04:23.155
(laughter)

01:04:23.155 --> 01:04:25.896
MATT: "Are you sure? It could be anywhere on this
table."

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:32.675
TALIESIN: It could, but it's there. Because it's
not anywhere else other than there.

01:04:32.675 --> 01:04:34.571
SAM: I'm not so sure about that, Percy.

01:04:34.571 --> 01:04:36.325
TALIESIN: Well, you're welcome to go in, if you
like.

01:04:36.325 --> 01:04:38.189
SAM: I choose the one on the left.

01:04:38.189 --> 01:04:39.741
TALIESIN: You'll have to give him a gold coin,
though.

01:04:39.741 --> 01:04:41.367
SAM: Sure. (ding)

01:04:41.367 --> 01:04:42.842
MATT: He takes the gold coin.

01:04:42.842 --> 01:04:45.429
"Do you wish to choose for this one instead,
then?"

01:04:45.463 --> 01:04:48.236
TALIESIN: No, I'm choosing on the right.

01:04:48.236 --> 01:04:55.237
MATT: Takes the gold piece. "And with that--

01:04:55.285 --> 01:04:56.679
"You found it, yay."

01:04:56.679 --> 01:04:58.964
(laughter)

01:04:58.964 --> 01:05:00.611
MATT: He gives you five gold.

01:05:00.611 --> 01:05:05.802
MARISHA: I lean into Percy and I say: this guy's
not a threat. He's okay.

01:05:05.844 --> 01:05:08.698
TALIESIN: Well, I am a dark evil demonic
creature.

01:05:08.698 --> 01:05:18.043
MATT: As he gives you the five gold, he
immediately takes it back.

01:05:18.043 --> 01:05:21.587
"But you wanted to know your fate."

01:05:21.633 --> 01:05:22.936
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:05:22.936 --> 01:05:25.150
MATT: "Step forward, young-- what's your name?"

01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:27.801
TALIESIN: Just Percy.

01:05:27.801 --> 01:05:36.320
MATT: "Percy. Please, present your face." As he
reaches out, he begins to feel the bumps on your

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:43.781
head. He begins to touch the outside of your face.
He closes his eyes. "Yes, yes, I can see into the

01:05:43.781 --> 01:05:47.664
"very nature of your existence. You, young--
Percy?"

01:05:47.664 --> 01:05:48.674
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:05:48.674 --> 01:05:57.978
MATT: "Percy, Percy. Young Percy. You, you have
hardworking hands, you've seen a lifetime of hard,

01:05:57.978 --> 01:06:06.067
"hard work in the fields. But you wish to make
your father proud, as does every son and you

01:06:06.114 --> 01:06:13.570
"will-- as one day you will become... a well
celebrated smith of horseshoes!

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:15.364
"Yes! Glory to Percy!"

01:06:15.364 --> 01:06:18.068
SAM: Amazing! So accurate.

01:06:18.068 --> 01:06:19.566
TALIESIN: So accurate.

01:06:19.566 --> 01:06:25.164
MATT: He leans in and says, "I could tell from the
black powder on your hands that you've worked with

01:06:25.164 --> 01:06:27.201
"a few pieces of iron in your time."

01:06:27.201 --> 01:06:29.249
TALIESIN: Very astute.

01:06:29.249 --> 01:06:36.265
MATT: (chuckles) "Thank you so much. So, who's
next?" The children start rushing up and-- you

01:06:36.265 --> 01:06:37.731
guys wish to continue with this guy?

01:06:37.731 --> 01:06:38.709
MARISHA: No.

01:06:38.709 --> 01:06:40.486
(laughter)

01:06:40.486 --> 01:06:42.419
SAM: All right, we'll leave.

01:06:42.419 --> 01:06:44.923
MARISHA: I've seen enough.

01:06:44.923 --> 01:06:46.865
MATT: Okay, who's doing what now?

01:06:46.865 --> 01:06:51.851
TRAVIS: Does anyone want to get down to the pie
contest? I thought I might arm wrestle first.

01:06:51.851 --> 01:06:53.544
LIAM: I think you should arm wrestle.

01:06:53.544 --> 01:06:55.124
SAM: Oh yeah, I want to see this.

01:06:55.124 --> 01:07:00.279
TRAVIS: I'd like to arm wrestle, in case I need to
eat my way out of sadness with pies.

01:07:00.279 --> 01:07:02.180
MATT: (laughs)

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:03.810
TALIESIN: Turn your sadness into victory.

01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:04.646
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:06.336
SAM: I will also enter the arm wrestling
competition.

01:07:06.336 --> 01:07:07.261
MATT: All right.

01:07:07.261 --> 01:07:08.250
TRAVIS: Yes!

01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:16.246
MATT: Okay, okay. So, as you guys step up, you can
see there's a woman dressed in a rather simple

01:07:16.246 --> 01:07:22.630
barmaid outfit, leather apron on her side and
she's pretty thick and rough-and-tumble with her

01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:26.882
timbre. She has her hair pulled up in a very tight
bun in the back. She has a bit of a smudge on her

01:07:26.882 --> 01:07:33.142
chin. She says, "All who wish to enter the contest
please step right here, pay your entry fee!

01:07:33.142 --> 01:07:39.227
"Graciously prove your might and your strength.
Show that you yourself are responsible for the

01:07:39.227 --> 01:07:46.350
"rebellion succeeding." Sees you. "You! You wish to
be part of this, yes!"

01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:48.484
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do!

01:07:48.484 --> 01:07:54.975
MATT: "Very well, very well. Ah, entry fee--" She
leans in and gets real for a second. "Entry fee is

01:07:55.023 --> 01:07:59.843
"25 gold pieces each. Winner gets free drinks and
the pot."

01:07:59.843 --> 01:08:02.369
LIAM: I slap down 25 gold on behalf of Grog.

01:08:02.369 --> 01:08:04.182
TRAVIS: (excited gasp)

01:08:04.182 --> 01:08:05.154
SAM: You're paying for his entry?

01:08:05.154 --> 01:08:06.531
LIAM: I'm paying for his entry, sure.

01:08:06.531 --> 01:08:07.487
SAM: And mine, as well?

01:08:07.487 --> 01:08:08.504
LIAM: No.

01:08:08.504 --> 01:08:10.134
TRAVIS: Good man.

01:08:10.134 --> 01:08:15.952
SAM: I would like to-- I would also like to
compete.

01:08:15.952 --> 01:08:24.795
MATT: (prolonged high-pitched giggle) "Sorry. 25
gold then."

01:08:24.795 --> 01:08:26.251
SAM: Here you go.

01:08:26.251 --> 01:08:31.357
MATT: "I mean no offense, I just-- it's a cute
beret."

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:35.240
TALIESIN: (laughs) Wow.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:41.582
MATT: Other individuals come and enter and you can
see as you guys are preparing for this event, you

01:08:41.582 --> 01:08:47.711
hear the rattling of chains nearby and you can see
two guards stepping up with--

01:08:47.711 --> 01:08:49.505
LAURA: The other goliath!

01:08:49.505 --> 01:08:54.962
MATT: Goran Vedmeyer, who you've seen--

01:08:54.962 --> 01:08:55.939
LAURA: The Duke!

01:08:55.939 --> 01:08:58.029
MATT: Yeah, no longer Duke. Un-Duked.

01:08:58.029 --> 01:09:02.580
LAURA: Once you Duke something, you can't un-Duke
it, Matt.

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:05.817
MATT: No, he's been thoroughly un-Duked, trust
me.

01:09:05.817 --> 01:09:07.987
MARISHA: The Duke that was formerly known as--

01:09:07.987 --> 01:09:09.382
TRAVIS: Duke Gonad.

01:09:09.382 --> 01:09:14.775
MATT: Yeah. He's brought by two of the guards and
the guards whisper to each other. They bring out

01:09:14.775 --> 01:09:21.484
their own 25 gold pieces and they plop it into the
pot. "He's entering as our proxy." He looks

01:09:21.484 --> 01:09:32.882
around. "Yes, what they said." She gives a nod.
"Well, I don't see why not, I suppose. All right!"

01:09:32.882 --> 01:09:37.121
Other people end up gathering up their change and
she goes over the sheet with one of her

01:09:37.121 --> 01:09:42.265
compatriots and they end up breaking off into
teams. There are four tables set up and for this

01:09:42.314 --> 01:09:45.532
round, at least, this part of the festival, they
break up in different parts. She calls out to one

01:09:45.532 --> 01:09:51.858
table. "All right, we have a Jasper Leer to go
against a Scanlan Shorthalt at this table."

01:09:51.917 --> 01:09:53.492
SAM: That's me!

01:09:53.547 --> 01:09:54.737
TRAVIS: Yay, Scanlan!

01:09:54.889 --> 01:09:56.452
MARISHA: Yes, Scanlan!

01:09:56.452 --> 01:10:06.717
MATT: As you're getting ready, you see a
farmer-type individual. Clean, as dressed as he

01:10:06.717 --> 01:10:10.000
could be in relatively ragged clothes, but he
looks like he's trying to be presentory for the

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:17.723
festival. Grey beard, longish shoulder-length
tousled hair. He walks up, pulling his wrist back,

01:10:17.723 --> 01:10:23.870
and he's got some good muscles. Looks like he's
definitely been working a lot of heavy farmwork

01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:29.315
for most of his life. He sits down at the table
across from you, gives you a look over.

01:10:29.315 --> 01:10:31.618
"Well, shall we begin?"

01:10:31.618 --> 01:10:42.772
SAM: Sure. Can I ever-so-covertly say to him, you
don't want to beat a gnome. You &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; want to

01:10:42.772 --> 01:10:46.981
beat a gnome. I'm casting Suggestion on him.

01:10:46.981 --> 01:10:55.874
MATT: I will say, go ahead and make a
sleight-of-hand check.

01:10:55.874 --> 01:11:01.931
SAM: Oh, the worst. Shit. 13.

01:11:01.931 --> 01:11:10.398
LAURA: What does it mean? The eyebrows!

01:11:10.398 --> 01:11:12.445
TRAVIS: And the phone came out.

01:11:12.445 --> 01:11:16.782
SAM: Who knows? We'll find out when my arm gets
wrenched off.

01:11:16.782 --> 01:11:18.691
LAURA: Looking at Jasper's stats, I can tell.

01:11:18.753 --> 01:11:21.216
MATT: No, what are you talking about?

01:11:21.216 --> 01:11:23.493
SAM: He's checking Twitter.

01:11:23.493 --> 01:11:34.382
MATT: Yeah, got to respond to a couple-- guys,
give me a second. All right. So, he has his hand

01:11:34.382 --> 01:11:40.756
up, he looks you over with a look of intensity for
a second. "Put your hand up."

01:11:40.756 --> 01:11:42.222
SAM: Yes, sir.

01:11:42.222 --> 01:11:53.295
MATT: He clasps his fingers entirely around your
hand at this point. As the intensity mounts, the

01:11:53.295 --> 01:11:58.657
crowd gathers around, everyone begins cheering,
the barmaid steps up again. "All right, two of

01:11:58.657 --> 01:12:11.477
"you, hands together. And prove your strength...
now!" Go ahead and make a strength check.

01:12:11.477 --> 01:12:12.719
SAM: 19.

01:12:12.719 --> 01:12:14.464
MARISHA: (laughs) Oh shit.

01:12:14.464 --> 01:12:20.816
MATT: You guys stand there for a second (groans)
his arm begins to push on yours, begins to bend

01:12:20.816 --> 01:12:26.663
back a little bit, you reflex with might and
begin to set him back up to the center. You've

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:31.533
reached a standstill, once again, back at the
center. His expression on his face looks

01:12:31.533 --> 01:12:33.819
frustrated and surprised.

01:12:33.819 --> 01:12:36.646
SAM: You weren't expecting this, were you? (pants)
Neither was I!

01:12:36.646 --> 01:12:39.794
MATT: Make another strength check.

01:12:39.794 --> 01:12:45.376
SAM: Not as good. 11.

01:12:45.376 --> 01:12:52.433
MATT: 11. At this point, as you say that, he
tenses and forces down your hand now, right at

01:12:52.433 --> 01:12:55.737
three-quarters to the table. Make another strength
check.

01:12:55.737 --> 01:12:57.749
MARISHA: Come on, Scanlan!

01:12:57.749 --> 01:12:58.756
SAM: 16!

01:12:58.756 --> 01:13:02.289
MATT: 16. (groans) About to touch the knuckles--

01:13:02.289 --> 01:13:08.726
SAM: What is going on? I had-- This has
never happened before.

01:13:08.854 --> 01:13:13.038
MATT: He's keeping his hand to his side, trying
not to grasp the edge of the table, which is

01:13:13.038 --> 01:13:17.148
technically against the rules. He's looking around
at everyone watching and realizes the sheer amount

01:13:17.148 --> 01:13:20.808
of attention that's put on the fact that this tiny
little gnome is now keeping him at a standstill.

01:13:20.808 --> 01:13:28.792
LIAM: I shout out from the crowd, Scanlan! Pike is
here! She's astral-projected in!

01:13:28.792 --> 01:13:30.391
SAM: Natural one.

01:13:30.391 --> 01:13:35.505
(laughter)

01:13:35.505 --> 01:13:45.806
MATT: With that moment of distraction, you look
around and (wham) your arm hits the table. Cheers

01:13:45.806 --> 01:13:48.744
go on, everyone shouts happily.

01:13:48.744 --> 01:13:51.037
SAM: You idiot!

01:13:51.037 --> 01:13:53.552
LIAM: All the blood rushed somewhere else, that's
not my fault.

01:13:53.552 --> 01:13:57.027
SAM: I had him! (groans)

01:13:57.027 --> 01:14:03.208
MATT: He lifts up his tankard to the side, someone
begins pouring ale into it. He shouts his victory

01:14:03.247 --> 01:14:07.566
out, everyone cheers. The barmaid pats you on your
back. "You did good, you did good."

01:14:07.566 --> 01:14:13.041
SAM: I don't need your pity! Grog, kick this
motherfucker's ass!

01:14:13.041 --> 01:14:24.532
MATT: Two more events go by, two more gentlemen
have a showdown-- actually no, it's a woman and a

01:14:24.532 --> 01:14:28.471
man. The woman is a pretty tough-looking warrior,
probably one of the guards of Castle Whitestone.

01:14:28.471 --> 01:14:34.001
She's still in partial armor, has been guarding
the event, has taken her helmet off to be part of

01:14:34.001 --> 01:14:41.272
this event, taking a moment to relax. She goes up
against another merchant of the town and just

01:14:41.272 --> 01:14:49.397
destroys him. The next bout is a man who, the way
he's dressed, appears to be a blacksmith. He still

01:14:49.397 --> 01:14:53.382
has his leather gauntlets on, he takes them off at
the table, takes off his leather apron and sets it

01:14:53.382 --> 01:14:58.245
to the side. Gets down and ready and looks around
for his opponent and the two guards bring up the

01:14:58.245 --> 01:15:04.853
chained Vedmeyer, who then sits down at the table,
the chains hitting against the sides of the wooden

01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:09.963
table top and coasting to the ground as they
adjust. He puts his arm on the table with a thud,

01:15:09.963 --> 01:15:14.272
and has to bend over to even reach the other guy's
grasp. You can see the look on his face

01:15:14.272 --> 01:15:24.551
immediately pale as he realizes who he's up
against. It's two rounds and maybe 20 seconds tops

01:15:24.551 --> 01:15:30.629
before Vedmeyer slams him so hard you can part of
the tabletop splinters inward and the guy brings

01:15:30.629 --> 01:15:38.567
his hand back with bleeding knuckles. He reaches
over, puts his hand out expectantly. The barmaid

01:15:38.567 --> 01:15:43.917
hands him a tankard full of ale. He downs it in
one gulp, slams it on on the table and stands back

01:15:43.917 --> 01:15:53.837
up again. He glances over at you and steps back
into the crowd. The second round of the events go

01:15:53.837 --> 01:15:58.190
in. You are paired up with the gentleman who
defeated Scanlan.

01:15:58.190 --> 01:15:59.809
MARISHA: Kick his ass, Grog!

01:15:59.809 --> 01:16:00.670
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:16:00.670 --> 01:16:02.131
SAM: Put him in a body bag!

01:16:02.131 --> 01:16:08.764
TRAVIS: I sit down and I say, I feel really bad
for you mate. You know, my friend? He's got hand

01:16:08.764 --> 01:16:15.406
herpes... So do I.

01:16:15.406 --> 01:16:17.000
SAM: It's true.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:25.980
MATT: Make a deception roll.

01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:28.532
TRAVIS: 20! 19 plus one!

01:16:28.532 --> 01:16:33.776
MATT: Natural one on his part. He looks genuinely
frightened and is about to back up and get the

01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:37.629
attention of the barmaid who's running this event
and he sees the crowd around.

01:16:37.629 --> 01:16:40.034
TRAVIS: I mean, you're a farmer, right? You handle
food.

01:16:40.034 --> 01:16:49.878
MATT: He spits in his hand, puts it out and grabs
your hand. The barmaid once again. "And-- prove

01:16:49.878 --> 01:16:53.533
"your strength!" Roll a strength check. He has
disadvantage.

01:16:53.533 --> 01:16:56.970
TRAVIS: 21.

01:16:56.970 --> 01:17:03.997
MATT: Natural one. He's already straining and the
back of his knuckles are immediately up against

01:17:03.997 --> 01:17:08.073
the wood. You can see fear in his eyes and he's
gripping, but he's also trying to move his fingers

01:17:08.073 --> 01:17:10.081
to make sure he doesn't make too much contact with
your hand.

01:17:10.081 --> 01:17:12.077
Go ahead and roll another strength check.

01:17:12.077 --> 01:17:16.513
TRAVIS: 11.

01:17:16.513 --> 01:17:21.754
MATT: At which point, he sees the grin on your
face and gets his will back behind him and

01:17:21.754 --> 01:17:25.655
(grunts) forces you back to the center. Make
another strength check.

01:17:25.706 --> 01:17:27.810
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Seven.

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:29.056
MATT: Natural 20.

01:17:29.056 --> 01:17:30.343
LAURA: Oh no!

01:17:30.343 --> 01:17:34.087
MATT: He (groans) slams you right over on the edge
of the table. Make another check.

01:17:34.087 --> 01:17:35.916
MARISHA: Come on, Grog!

01:17:35.916 --> 01:17:40.575
TRAVIS: 23.

01:17:40.575 --> 01:17:45.851
MATT: 19. Back up to the center, at a standstill.
You see now the veins bulging at his neck, you can

01:17:45.851 --> 01:17:51.150
see now, his face is turning red from the strain.
He's breathing heavily (pants) as he pushes again.

01:17:51.150 --> 01:17:52.312
Make another strength check.

01:17:52.312 --> 01:17:53.704
LAURA: Come on, Grog!

01:17:53.704 --> 01:17:55.365
TRAVIS: Eight.

01:17:55.365 --> 01:18:01.647
MATT: (chuckles) Eight. (groans) Keeping you right
in the middle. Make another check.

01:18:01.647 --> 01:18:06.932
SAM: I hold up my hand and I use Minor Illusion to
make it all dotted with herpes.

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:13.624
MATT: He glances sidelong at your hand and
(whimpers). I'm going to give him disadvantage on

01:18:13.624 --> 01:18:16.156
this one. All right, what did you get?

01:18:16.156 --> 01:18:17.544
TRAVIS: 17.

01:18:17.544 --> 01:18:22.984
MATT: 17. (laughs) With a disadvantage, he got a
six. (groans) The hand goes at three-quarters.

01:18:22.984 --> 01:18:26.275
He's now looking at you, looking at Scanlan's
hand, looking at you, looking at his own hand,

01:18:26.275 --> 01:18:28.387
he's really worried. Make another strength check.

01:18:28.387 --> 01:18:32.544
TRAVIS: It's slippery when the pores start to
seep. That's a one.

01:18:32.544 --> 01:18:33.448
SAM: No!

01:18:33.448 --> 01:18:34.567
TALIESIN: No!

01:18:34.567 --> 01:18:41.802
MATT: With a disadvantage, he gets a two. You guys
are at the middle again.

01:18:41.802 --> 01:18:43.604
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:18:43.604 --> 01:18:44.804
MATT: Big struggle.

01:18:44.804 --> 01:18:45.889
TRAVIS: 22.

01:18:45.889 --> 01:18:51.544
MATT: With disadvantage again, because of that--
though disadvantage is fading at this point. He

01:18:51.544 --> 01:18:54.494
got a 12. So yeah (groans), now he's back down.

01:18:54.494 --> 01:18:56.450
LAURA: Come on Grog, finish it!

01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:58.200
TRAVIS: 22.

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:04.055
MATT: He got a seven. He looks at you, looks at
the hand, looks at you again and you can see in

01:19:04.055 --> 01:19:13.716
his face, the sudden look of acceptance as you
stop playing with him and (whack) slam it really

01:19:13.716 --> 01:19:18.160
hard on the wood. You can see, he pulls away...
(gasps) "Wash it! Wash it, please! Wash it,

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:19.270
"somebody wash it!"

01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:24.033
TRAVIS: You know, the cure for that is actually on
my man Vax's groin. It's very magical.

01:19:24.033 --> 01:19:29.183
MATT: He slowly backs into the crowd, looking very
disturbed and disgusted as everyone else is

01:19:29.183 --> 01:19:33.364
cheering for you. A tankard is slammed before you,
filled with ale.

01:19:33.364 --> 01:19:36.013
"Drink up, you've earned it, champion."

01:19:36.013 --> 01:19:42.221
TRAVIS: I look at Gonad over at the side. I drink
it, chug it down, and hold up the finger at the

01:19:42.221 --> 01:19:43.389
same time.

01:19:43.389 --> 01:19:50.618
MATT: (laughs) He sits there and tenses for a second with a
grin, as he growls, his cold breath in the cold

01:19:50.662 --> 01:19:57.156
Winter's Crest air dissipates up above him and he
gives you a nod, the slow look of warrior

01:19:57.156 --> 01:20:02.006
intensity, but respect. You can see he's looking
forward to hopefully this as much as you are, but

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:04.102
he still has a battle to do himself.

01:20:04.102 --> 01:20:08.745
LIAM: I've spent the last ten minutes while he's
kicking that guy's ass to find a soldier or

01:20:08.745 --> 01:20:10.542
somebody in the crowd to bet.

01:20:10.542 --> 01:20:11.728
SAM: A young boy?

01:20:11.728 --> 01:20:13.840
LIAM: I'm not you.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.921
(laughter)

01:20:15.921 --> 01:20:19.631
LIAM: 200 gold on Grog. Somebody in the crowd.

01:20:19.631 --> 01:20:21.324
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:20:21.324 --> 01:20:22.899
TALIESIN: All right.

01:20:22.899 --> 01:20:27.017
LIAM: 14.

01:20:27.017 --> 01:20:33.417
MATT: Going around, you're hard-pressed to find
somebody who at this moment in time is interested

01:20:33.417 --> 01:20:38.768
in betting any money against the goliath that
helped save the city. You find one gentleman who

01:20:38.768 --> 01:20:45.928
seems a little interested and he gives you this
sidelong, sleazy grin. "Tell you what, not 200

01:20:45.928 --> 01:20:47.855
"gold, but I'll put 50 down."

01:20:47.855 --> 01:20:50.968
LIAM: That's not worth it. 75 gold?

01:20:50.968 --> 01:20:53.853
MATT: "Step away, halfie."

01:20:53.895 --> 01:20:58.561
LAURA: Oh! I heard it. I give him the evil eye.

01:20:58.561 --> 01:21:07.622
MATT: He's too focused on the current bout at
hand. At this table, you can now see Vedmeyer and

01:21:07.622 --> 01:21:14.228
the woman guard sits down. Someone's like, "Oh,
Trisha's wrestling."

01:21:14.228 --> 01:21:19.669
TRAVIS: Her name's Trisha? Trish the Dish.

01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:27.130
MATT: Vedmeyer, again with his chains against the
wood as he sits down with a smile. He gives her a

01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:31.521
grin and nod. She's just-- intensity towards him
the whole time. You can see there's a little bit

01:21:31.521 --> 01:21:36.586
of intensity to win, but you also see spite in
that look. You see that she knows what he's done

01:21:36.586 --> 01:21:44.914
and this victory means more to her than otherwise.
The two of them-- first match, she pushes and gets

01:21:44.914 --> 01:21:50.656
the upper hand. A three-quarter view perspective,
she's tensing herself, you hear the muscle tensing

01:21:50.707 --> 01:21:57.810
beneath the armor itself, the metal creaking as
her whole upper torso begins to push into it. She

01:21:57.810 --> 01:21:59.104
begins to push it back--

01:21:59.104 --> 01:22:00.521
LAURA: Yeah! Trish the Dish!

01:22:00.521 --> 01:22:03.532
ALL: Trish the Dish! Trish the Dish!

01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:08.739
MATT: As you guys are shouting this and keeping it
going, she gets pushed back again into a defensive

01:22:08.739 --> 01:22:13.312
position. You see the blood rushing to her face,
but he himself is starting to look really intense.

01:22:13.312 --> 01:22:20.434
You can see there's surprise in his face from the
battle she's giving. She (groans) pushes him back

01:22:20.434 --> 01:22:23.192
to the center, this back and forth, the crowd is
starting to get really intense. You can see the

01:22:23.192 --> 01:22:27.097
shouting, the cheering, gets really quiet as
everyone is now breathlessly watching this bout.

01:22:27.097 --> 01:22:40.930
She pushes to three-quarters-- He rallies his own
strength, but it's not enough, as she (impact

01:22:41.042 --> 01:22:53.733
sound) onto the table. As she releases, she goes,
"You deserve that, and much more." She gets up and

01:22:53.733 --> 01:22:58.871
walks away. The tankard is held out for her. She
pushes it aside and cracks her knuckles as she

01:22:58.871 --> 01:23:07.356
steps away. Vedmeyer is there staring at his hand.
"Hmm. Fitting. It's a real pity, I was looking

01:23:07.356 --> 01:23:08.910
"forward to fighting you."

01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:11.292
TRAVIS: Well, get used to disappointment,
shithead.

01:23:11.292 --> 01:23:15.826
MATT: At which point, his chains are tightened and
the guards lift him up again off of his seat and

01:23:15.826 --> 01:23:18.729
he gets led off back into the crowd.

01:23:18.729 --> 01:23:21.621
LAURA: Yeah, walk away, you beardless bastard.

01:23:21.621 --> 01:23:27.097
MATT: As everyone gathers in now, you can now see
more discussions and people are starting to really

01:23:27.097 --> 01:23:35.515
place bets down now on the outcome of this
circumstance. The barmaid comes up again. "You,

01:23:35.515 --> 01:23:44.083
"champion Grog, sit down. And you, champion Trisha,
sit down. As the final round of this show of

01:23:44.083 --> 01:23:48.267
"majestic might happens now. Hands clasped,
please."

01:23:48.267 --> 01:23:52.758
TRAVIS: If I may, thank you for your service to
this city. That last round

01:23:52.758 --> 01:23:54.854
was a true pleasure to watch.

01:23:54.854 --> 01:23:59.388
MATT: Her face goes from hardened to soft for a
minute as she reaches out and clasps you, not hand

01:23:59.388 --> 01:24:06.006
in hand, but forearm to forearm, and gives you a
solid shake. "I've done so little. You've done far

01:24:06.006 --> 01:24:09.474
"more. But we all must do our part to keep the city
safe."

01:24:09.474 --> 01:24:11.388
TRAVIS: Aye.

01:24:11.388 --> 01:24:14.225
MATT: "But right now, I'm going to have to destroy
you."

01:24:14.225 --> 01:24:17.457
LAURA: I kind of love Trish the Dish.

01:24:17.457 --> 01:24:19.065
MARISHA: I know, I like her, too.

01:24:19.065 --> 01:24:26.343
MATT: Her clasp on your forearm slides back,
keeping your hand. Both of you tense muscles,

01:24:26.343 --> 01:24:28.467
we're talking Predator vs. Schwarzenegger.

01:24:28.467 --> 01:24:33.386
TRAVIS: (Schwarzenegger accent) Yah, what's the
matter, Dylan? You guys ate too many pretzels?

01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:43.564
MATT: (laughs) Just like that. As the crowd begins
to shout different names, you can see people

01:24:43.564 --> 01:24:48.997
going, "Trish, Trish, Trish, Grog, Grog, Grog."
The voices are starting to grow and grow as both

01:24:48.997 --> 01:24:56.375
of you are standing there focusing on each other.
You can see her tightly bunned dark brunette hair,

01:24:56.375 --> 01:24:59.912
you can see these green eyes piercing through,
looking straight into yours with a bit of sly

01:24:59.912 --> 01:25:02.904
smirk on the side of her face. You can see a
little bit of a scar on the outside of her face

01:25:02.904 --> 01:25:06.714
that's longtime healed and you can see she's
definitely seen her share of battle, just from the

01:25:06.714 --> 01:25:08.929
complexion and the intensity in her face.

01:25:08.929 --> 01:25:11.920
MARISHA: She's one of us.

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:17.119
MATT: "For the final round, let this show of might
begin!" Strength check.

01:25:17.119 --> 01:25:19.612
TRAVIS: Eight.

01:25:19.612 --> 01:25:26.323
MATT: As the moment of tension hits, you can sense
there's definitely a balance, both of you are

01:25:26.323 --> 01:25:33.794
keeping at bay. She cocks her head curiously and
forces you down to the three-quarter back

01:25:33.794 --> 01:25:36.124
position. Go ahead and make another strength
check.

01:25:36.124 --> 01:25:38.762
LAURA: Come on, Grog! Oh my god.

01:25:38.762 --> 01:25:39.859
TRAVIS: Six.

01:25:39.859 --> 01:25:43.374
LIAM: It's that sword's influence.

01:25:43.374 --> 01:25:46.686
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's laughing in the Bag of
Holding.

01:25:46.686 --> 01:25:51.684
MATT: She brings you right down to the edge of the
table and you can see in her face, there's this

01:25:51.684 --> 01:25:59.007
genuine look of surprise, like she probably could
have finished you, but she feels like there's a

01:25:59.007 --> 01:26:01.662
trick or there's something to it that she can't be
beating you this easy.

01:26:01.662 --> 01:26:07.420
TRAVIS: I'm so surprised by what's happening. I
use Intimidating Presence on her.

01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:09.395
MARISHA: Oh shit.

01:26:09.395 --> 01:26:14.977
MATT: (laughs) Okay. Go ahead and make an
intimidation check.

01:26:14.977 --> 01:26:18.559
TRAVIS: Fuck.

01:26:18.559 --> 01:26:20.876
MATT: Does this have to be during a rage?

01:26:20.876 --> 01:26:23.131
TRAVIS: 12. I'll go into a rage for it.

01:26:23.131 --> 01:26:27.134
MATT: (laughing) It may have to be. Let's see.

01:26:27.134 --> 01:26:29.919
LAURA: (laughing) Why weren't you raging the whole
time?

01:26:29.919 --> 01:26:33.468
TRAVIS: I was hoping I wouldn't need it!

01:26:33.468 --> 01:26:36.544
MATT: No, you don't have to be in a rage for it,
but you can choose to, if you want.

01:26:36.544 --> 01:26:38.851
TRAVIS: it doesn't add anything to my strength
roll, right?

01:26:38.851 --> 01:26:44.553
MATT: A 12 for intimidation? Well, what do you want
to do to try and intimidate her? She's about to

01:26:44.602 --> 01:26:46.371
finish you off on this table.

01:26:46.371 --> 01:26:53.622
TRAVIS: I'm like, oh! (grunts) and I bite down on
my tongue and blood just starts to pour out of the

01:26:53.622 --> 01:26:54.642
corner of my mouth.

01:26:54.642 --> 01:26:55.899
LAURA: Oh, gross!

01:26:55.899 --> 01:27:00.857
MATT: She sees this, and her eyes go wide for a
second. She pulls back and for a brief moment, you

01:27:00.857 --> 01:27:05.446
feel her grip loosen ever so slightly. Go ahead
and make the next strength check with advantage.

01:27:05.446 --> 01:27:13.208
TRAVIS: Fuck. (laughing) It's unreal. 11.

01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:14.304
MATT: 11?

01:27:14.304 --> 01:27:16.070
TRAVIS: The other one was a one.

01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:20.223
MATT: Well, I'm glad you had advantage on that;
she rolled a five. So you do manage to (groans)

01:27:20.223 --> 01:27:24.512
force her back up. You're still in a bad place,
but you manage to pull out of that circle and you

01:27:24.512 --> 01:27:29.798
can see now her intensity hits and she realizes
she's not going to go soft on you at all going

01:27:29.798 --> 01:27:35.250
forward. But as the blood pools down your chin,
you can feel the iron-y taste swishing around in

01:27:35.283 --> 01:27:40.004
your mouth and you can see there's a little bit of
a quiver to her. She's still spooked by this whole

01:27:40.004 --> 01:27:43.598
circumstance, but she's trying her best. Go ahead
and make another strength check.

01:27:43.598 --> 01:27:45.713
TRAVIS: She's battle-worn. 19.

01:27:45.713 --> 01:27:46.738
LAURA: That's good!

01:27:46.738 --> 01:27:51.035
MATT: That's good. She has disadvantage on these
because of the fright. I'm giving her that, but

01:27:51.035 --> 01:27:54.199
even still, she still rolls a 17. What did you
roll, total?

01:27:54.199 --> 01:27:55.180
TRAVIS: 19.

01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:59.123
MATT: 19. You guys keep it-- she's still holding
you there, you're not able to gain any ground.

01:27:59.123 --> 01:28:03.086
You're really impressed by this display she's
giving you. Roll again.

01:28:03.086 --> 01:28:05.506
TRAVIS: Do I have advantage? No.

01:28:05.506 --> 01:28:06.363
MATT: No.

01:28:06.363 --> 01:28:07.656
TRAVIS: 12.

01:28:07.656 --> 01:28:11.709
MATT: 12? Okay. She forces you back down--

01:28:11.709 --> 01:28:16.457
SAM: I step forward and I sing a song of
inspiration.

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:18.171
MATT: What are you singing?

01:28:18.171 --> 01:28:24.118
SAM: I sing, (sings) let's go raging now,
everybody's learning how, come on on a rampage

01:28:24.118 --> 01:28:25.002
with me!

01:28:25.002 --> 01:28:27.014
TALIESIN: Come on on a rampage with me!

01:28:27.014 --> 01:28:32.885
MATT: All right, take a d10 inspiration, as you
hear the song break through the intensity and you

01:28:32.885 --> 01:28:37.673
know that Scanlan's presence alone in itself and
his fine ditties means that you can do this.

01:28:37.673 --> 01:28:39.165
TRAVIS: Fine ditties!

01:28:39.165 --> 01:28:41.908
LIAM: Show us your ditties!

01:28:41.908 --> 01:28:44.402
TRAVIS: 16.

01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:46.196
MATT: 16?

01:28:46.196 --> 01:28:48.420
LAURA: With the ten inspiration.

01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:55.508
MATT: With the ten? Okay. It's good you did that.
You force her back up, she starts like, really

01:28:55.542 --> 01:29:00.731
pushing into it and you can see now the sweat's
dripping off of her brow, her eyes are quivering.

01:29:00.731 --> 01:29:04.430
Make another check. How long does that last?

01:29:04.430 --> 01:29:05.798
TRAVIS: Seven.

01:29:05.798 --> 01:29:08.953
MATT: Seven. Hold on.

01:29:08.953 --> 01:29:10.267
LAURA: You should switch.

01:29:10.267 --> 01:29:11.491
SAM: Grog, what are you doing?!

01:29:11.491 --> 01:29:16.228
TRAVIS: (laughing) I don't know! They're so low!
It was all those free rolls during the two weeks

01:29:16.228 --> 01:29:17.608
when I rolled 20--

01:29:17.608 --> 01:29:19.713
SAM: Oh my god, do you really have hand herpes?

01:29:19.713 --> 01:29:21.511
(laughter)

01:29:21.511 --> 01:29:29.473
MATT: What did you roll?

01:29:29.473 --> 01:29:30.809
TRAVIS: Seven.

01:29:30.809 --> 01:29:35.533
MATT: Seven. Yeah, she still beats you. So, at
this point, you're pushed down.

01:29:35.533 --> 01:29:37.476
She gives you this look--

01:29:37.476 --> 01:29:38.794
TRAVIS: This is unreal.

01:29:38.794 --> 01:29:48.350
MATT: Yeah. Of intense anger-- and her face
softens and she gives you a nod of respect. (thud)

01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:59.260
Releases her grip and pulls away, holds her arms
up, crowd goes wild. The drink is slammed in front

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:03.732
of her, the ale swishing and spilling over the
side. She takes it in one hand and slides it

01:30:03.732 --> 01:30:04.973
forward and hands it to you.

01:30:04.973 --> 01:30:06.659
LAURA: Aw, she's a good lady.

01:30:06.659 --> 01:30:13.286
TRAVIS: You are a true warrior and I hope you'll
continue to protect this city with that strength.

01:30:13.341 --> 01:30:21.595
MATT: "I intend to." She gives you a nod, walks
around, accepts her coin purse and steps back into

01:30:21.595 --> 01:30:22.889
the rest of the celebration.

01:30:22.889 --> 01:30:32.107
TRAVIS: I walk away (coughs), coughing (coughs),
trying not to cry. (coughs) I take my tankard and

01:30:32.107 --> 01:30:38.081
splash it on my face. Oh, it's just ale. It's just
ale. (sobs)

01:30:38.081 --> 01:30:41.428
SAM: It's okay, Grog. Let's go get you drunk.

01:30:41.428 --> 01:30:53.751
MATT: As this is happening, a courier comes up
dressed in colors that are reminiscent of the

01:30:53.751 --> 01:30:59.999
courier service that travels through Emon, through
Westruun. There's a certain type of overcoat they

01:30:59.999 --> 01:31:05.285
wear that gives you the inclination that they've
traveled from nearby civilization. Steps up with a

01:31:05.285 --> 01:31:09.234
rolled up sequence of letters and a small box that
is wrapped up.

01:31:09.234 --> 01:31:12.060
MARISHA: Oh look, the young boy you ordered,
Scanlan.

01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:15.827
MATT: He's in his mid-20s.

01:31:15.827 --> 01:31:18.461
(laughter)

01:31:18.461 --> 01:31:25.710
MATT: He's asking around. "Looking for a Percival
and a Vox Machina. Percival?"

01:31:25.710 --> 01:31:27.030
TALIESIN: I'm Percival.

01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:28.366
MATT: "You're Percival?"

01:31:28.366 --> 01:31:29.437
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:31:29.437 --> 01:31:35.847
MATT: "I'm to deliver this to you." He hands you
the small box. "I have here two small letters."

01:31:35.887 --> 01:31:44.327
And hands them over both to you. There's a small,
thin one that is actually written to Percival, and

01:31:44.327 --> 01:31:48.317
there's one addressed to Vox Machina.

01:31:48.317 --> 01:31:52.615
TALIESIN: I was going to sit here and watch you
roll them.

01:31:52.615 --> 01:31:54.004
MARISHA: Presentation's lost.

01:31:54.004 --> 01:31:55.251
MATT: That's fine.

01:31:55.251 --> 01:31:57.518
SAM: I just noticed Taliesin's outfit, by the
way.

01:31:57.518 --> 01:32:00.188
LAURA: We were supposed to wear pajamas.

01:32:00.188 --> 01:32:04.740
TALIESIN: I wore my pajamas. My muppet pajamas.

01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:06.684
MATT: Yeah, the week got busy and we forgot.

01:32:06.684 --> 01:32:09.929
TRAVIS: You don't want me in my pajamas because
they're--

01:32:09.929 --> 01:32:12.487
MATT: That one's to you and the other one's to Vox
Machina.

01:32:12.487 --> 01:32:18.170
SAM: (sings) Letters, we've got letters.

01:32:18.170 --> 01:32:24.739
TALIESIN: Oh, this is quite interesting. "Vox
Machina, a little bird tells me you have been

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:31.281
"playing the heroes again. Keep this up, and the
whole world will end up indebted to you. Please

01:32:31.281 --> 01:32:37.720
"accept this small gift in the spirit of Winter's
Crest, as a token of my enduring gratitude.

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:44.019
"Perhaps it will prove useful in a difficult
moment. In the meantime, I look forward to a

01:32:44.019 --> 01:32:51.382
"fuller account of your deeds reaching us in
Vasselheim. A joyous Crest to you all. It seems

01:32:51.382 --> 01:32:53.746
"you have earned it. Lillith."

01:32:53.746 --> 01:32:55.814
LAURA: Oh!

01:32:55.814 --> 01:32:58.788
TALIESIN: "P.S., Zahra sends her greetings."

01:32:58.788 --> 01:33:00.799
SAM: (dreamily) Zahra.

01:33:00.799 --> 01:33:02.376
MARISHA: The tieflings!

01:33:02.376 --> 01:33:07.227
SAM: We had quite a night together. Just braiding
each other's hair.

01:33:07.227 --> 01:33:10.381
TALIESIN: I tuck the private note away and put it
in my pocket.

01:33:10.381 --> 01:33:13.549
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's another one, right?

01:33:13.549 --> 01:33:15.390
MATT: There is a box, yes.

01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:17.724
LAURA: Oh, is it big enough to hold a giant
carpet?

01:33:17.724 --> 01:33:21.723
TALIESIN: Perhaps a small ice egg.

01:33:21.723 --> 01:33:23.578
MATT: It's about that big in your hands.

01:33:23.578 --> 01:33:25.895
TALIESIN: We open the box.

01:33:25.895 --> 01:33:28.045
MATT: You open the gift. Inside, there are two--

01:33:28.045 --> 01:33:29.322
SAM: Check it for traps!

01:33:29.322 --> 01:33:38.765
MATT: (laughs) Make a reflex save-- no. As you
open it, you see inside there are two crystalline

01:33:38.765 --> 01:33:41.753
stones that both identically look like that.

01:33:41.753 --> 01:33:43.106
LAURA: Okay.

01:33:43.106 --> 01:33:45.062
TALIESIN: It's been a while since we had a visual
aid.

01:33:45.106 --> 01:33:52.438
MATT: Yeah, it's nice when you have a really good
artist, apparently. But two stones like this. They

01:33:52.438 --> 01:33:54.270
are called Gate Stones.

01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:56.191
SAM: Gate Stones?

01:33:56.191 --> 01:34:04.313
MATT: The two stones are essentially linked. One
is placed wherever you like and the other is kept

01:34:04.313 --> 01:34:08.830
with you. A single individual, just an individual,
not a group, can take a minute to concentrate on

01:34:08.830 --> 01:34:13.057
one stone and be instantly transported to where
the other stone is, with the stone.

01:34:13.057 --> 01:34:14.254
TRAVIS: Badass.

01:34:14.254 --> 01:34:16.436
LIAM: One-way ticket.

01:34:16.436 --> 01:34:17.650
MATT: Essentially, yeah.

01:34:17.650 --> 01:34:21.530
TRAVIS: You take it with you and you can zoom back
to wherever you left it.

01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:24.293
SAM: There are two stones in this box?

01:34:24.293 --> 01:34:25.899
MATT: Yeah. They are the two that are linked.

01:34:25.899 --> 01:34:27.186
TRAVIS: A person or linked?

01:34:27.186 --> 01:34:28.831
MATT: No, there is a single set.

01:34:28.831 --> 01:34:33.288
MARISHA: So this is a get out of jail free card.

01:34:33.288 --> 01:34:37.822
SAM: Or a bamf-in-Pike card.

01:34:37.822 --> 01:34:44.361
MATT: There's multiple situational uses for it,
depending. But apparently this has been

01:34:44.408 --> 01:34:50.034
painstakingly either enchanted, constructed, and
sent by Lillith for you.

01:34:50.034 --> 01:34:51.902
LIAM: They're all from Lillith?

01:34:51.902 --> 01:34:54.071
MATT: Yeah, the letters and those two stones.

01:34:54.071 --> 01:34:55.638
SAM: From Lillith and Zahra?

01:34:55.638 --> 01:34:58.225
MATT: And Zahra, both of them, essentially.

01:34:58.225 --> 01:35:00.448
MARISHA: Yeah, Lillith doesn't have the other
stone?

01:35:00.448 --> 01:35:02.233
LIAM: For a little arcane booty call?

01:35:02.233 --> 01:35:04.592
TALIESIN: I don't know &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; you're talking
about.

01:35:04.592 --> 01:35:06.660
TRAVIS: Please?

01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:07.829
TALIESIN: No.

01:35:07.829 --> 01:35:10.510
LAURA: I don't think I've ever seen Percy giggle
before.

01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:12.312
TRAVIS: Are you blushing?

01:35:12.312 --> 01:35:15.007
TALIESIN: No. It's cold. Very cold.

01:35:15.007 --> 01:35:20.024
TRAVIS: It's a new demon, isn't it? The blushing
demon!

01:35:20.024 --> 01:35:21.479
TALIESIN: She was great, wasn't she?

01:35:21.479 --> 01:35:24.209
SAM: Lillith is a true friend. Zahra, as well.

01:35:24.209 --> 01:35:25.821
TALIESIN: Zahra is great, as well.

01:35:25.821 --> 01:35:29.855
MATT: You hear murmurs now, people mentioning the
pie-eating contest starting soon.

01:35:29.899 --> 01:35:31.087
SAM: Vex and Vax!

01:35:31.087 --> 01:35:34.451
LAURA: All right, we'll give it a go.

01:35:34.451 --> 01:35:38.637
MATT: As you guys make your way over there, we're
going to go ahead and go to our break. We're at

01:35:38.677 --> 01:35:42.006
the middle point here, yeah. So it's going to be a
longer break guys, because we've got a little

01:35:42.006 --> 01:35:47.344
present for you. I know for a while we've been
talking about this work we've been doing on a

01:35:47.344 --> 01:35:52.398
pre-stream story of Vox Machina's adventures that
you guys hadn't had a chance to really

01:35:52.398 --> 01:35:58.799
experience. So, through all of us doing our
individual narration, as well as the wonderful

01:35:58.850 --> 01:36:09.079
Wendy Sullivan doing incredible work on 50 pieces
of art for this, and using music from actually

01:36:09.079 --> 01:36:13.642
some of our Critters that sent us some great
musical tracks, we have been able to present to

01:36:13.642 --> 01:36:19.376
you over the next 20 minutes, the story of Vox
Machina, the beginning. So, enjoy guys, we'll see

01:36:19.376 --> 01:36:20.554
you here in a moment.

01:36:20.554 --> 01:36:21.976
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:36:21.976 --> 01:36:30.841
MATT: The grandest of adventures often stem from
humble beginnings. The story of Vox Machina is one

01:36:30.841 --> 01:36:37.937
such a tale. They begin as a ragtag group of
mercenaries in the swamp town of Stillben, eking

01:36:37.937 --> 01:36:43.866
out a living, when a job board posting brings them
to Fendril Vas, the wealthy head of a small

01:36:43.866 --> 01:36:45.438
merchant empire.

01:36:45.438 --> 01:36:51.443
Hired to investigate new competition in town
called The Myriad, the path eventually leads them

01:36:51.563 --> 01:36:56.144
into a chamber housing a planar rift, pulling the
group into the plane of the stillborn god

01:36:56.144 --> 01:37:03.628
Crysa-Thul. It is revealed that the contract was a
ruse to feed the party to the undead, fetal deity.

01:37:03.628 --> 01:37:09.404
Upon destroying the abomination, the party returns
to repay Fendril's deceit

01:37:09.404 --> 01:37:12.393
with a blade to the throat.

01:37:12.393 --> 01:37:17.115
LAURA: Weeks pass, and Grog the barbarian hasn't
been seen since suddenly leaving for the city of

01:37:17.115 --> 01:37:22.378
Westruun. Heading there in search of him, the
party meets his childhood friend, and their new

01:37:22.378 --> 01:37:28.875
companion: the gnome cleric, Pike. Grog apparently
hasn't been acting normally, and had marched off

01:37:28.875 --> 01:37:34.787
on his own through the Bramblewood towards the
ominous mountain, Gatshadow. The party followed,

01:37:34.787 --> 01:37:40.868
dispensing with a troop of roadside thieves along
the way, and wound their way toward the mountain.

01:37:40.868 --> 01:37:47.445
Deep within, they encountered an abandoned
subterranean city and eventually a crypt housing a

01:37:47.489 --> 01:37:53.842
mind-controlled Grog, the reanimated corpse of his
father Strongjaw, and a dying mage attempting a

01:37:53.842 --> 01:38:00.729
ritual to Lichdom. Our heroes slayed the mage, but
not before he could complete the ritual and embed

01:38:00.729 --> 01:38:03.346
his phylactery into Grog's chest.

01:38:03.346 --> 01:38:08.678
Returning to town in search of aid, they find
there are few of enough knowledge or power to

01:38:08.678 --> 01:38:15.044
ascertain the nature of Grog's wound. Also, rumors
of missing children begin to reach the party's

01:38:15.044 --> 01:38:21.923
ears. While contemplating all this at a local inn,
the party is approached by a mysterious elf named

01:38:21.923 --> 01:38:27.860
Drez Vina who wishes to pay handsomely for the
party to infiltrate an archmage's tower, and

01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:30.810
retrieve a particular brass box within.

01:38:30.810 --> 01:38:36.152
Pushing forward in the hopes of speaking with this
archmage, the party accepts, and passes through

01:38:36.152 --> 01:38:43.192
arcane trap after trap to reach the top of the
tower, deciding not to steal from the archmage but

01:38:43.192 --> 01:38:50.073
instead parley with him for his aid. The tower's
keeper, Realmseer Eskil Ryndarien, agrees to help

01:38:50.073 --> 01:38:56.189
and sends the party to collect two items he
requires for the ritual: the skull of a nightmare

01:38:56.189 --> 01:39:03.441
and the heart of a nymph. The caveat: their
defeated foe is indeed a lich now, and in merely

01:39:03.441 --> 01:39:07.279
two weeks, he will be reborn within Grog!

01:39:07.279 --> 01:39:13.426
They travel north to the Umbra Hills, wrestle with
a small cult to slay their infernal messenger and

01:39:13.426 --> 01:39:20.789
his nightmare steed, and find a fresh companion in
Percy, newly freed from imprisonment. From there,

01:39:20.789 --> 01:39:27.963
the party rushes south to the Frostweald, a forest
shrouded in eternal winter. Battling past

01:39:27.963 --> 01:39:34.683
basilisks, the party finds a single, unfrozen pool
where they coax a nymph from her dimensional

01:39:34.683 --> 01:39:41.761
sanctuary. Talking their way out of battle, Grog
enters the sanctuary with the nymph, and returns

01:39:41.761 --> 01:39:47.579
holding a jewel gifted by the beautiful creature:
the "heart" of the nymph.

01:39:47.579 --> 01:39:53.095
LIAM: Traveling back to the archmage, the ritual
is completed and the phylactery destroyed in time,

01:39:53.095 --> 01:40:00.715
but not without some lingering necromancy branded
within Grog. They are suddenly approached by the

01:40:00.715 --> 01:40:07.630
mysterious elf again, saying his master is unhappy
with the broken contract, and he demands that either

01:40:07.674 --> 01:40:13.852
the debt be paid, or the party complete a more
difficult contract in its place. The party

01:40:13.852 --> 01:40:19.402
accepts, and heads into the Shade Barrow, an
ancient druid burial chamber that was purchased

01:40:19.402 --> 01:40:25.345
and renovated by an eccentric lord who made it his
own tomb. Fighting the denizens of the barrow,

01:40:25.345 --> 01:40:31.998
they locate the tomb and the iron golem guarding
it. Successfully defeating the golem, they tear

01:40:31.998 --> 01:40:38.138
the Arcane Cortex from its chest and return it to
Drez to square their debt.

01:40:38.138 --> 01:40:44.299
After a bit of R and R, a clean-shaven dwarf named
Grimthorne propositions the group to enter a

01:40:44.299 --> 01:40:51.212
nearby, underground fighting ring, even offering
to represent them. The party agrees and,

01:40:51.247 --> 01:40:54.766
not surprisingly, manages to pull off a victory.

01:40:54.766 --> 01:41:00.360
With the holiday of Winter's Crest arriving, the
town bustles with preparation for a festival,

01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:07.775
during which a strange blue crystal is delivered
in the name of Archmage Eskil. This crystal

01:41:07.775 --> 01:41:14.213
suddenly detonates, freezing the entire populace
of Westruun in ice-- though the party is protected

01:41:14.213 --> 01:41:21.970
by a sudden ally in the streets. In a last-ditch
arcane effort, a mystic merchant named Noja

01:41:21.970 --> 01:41:29.085
manages to shield the group from harm. And where
the crystal previously rested now stood a pale,

01:41:29.085 --> 01:41:36.865
nude woman of white hair and frail physique. She
opens a portal and leaps through, the party giving

01:41:36.865 --> 01:41:43.935
chase into what seems like an icy, frozen world,
chaotic and elemental in nature. They catch up to

01:41:43.935 --> 01:41:52.697
the woman, who then reveals her true self: a great
white dragon. Weakened by her premature "rebirth",

01:41:52.697 --> 01:41:58.134
the party manages to defeat her, and upon
returning to Westruun, discover its people

01:41:58.134 --> 01:42:00.790
released from their icy prison.

01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:07.658
With the archmage Eskil Ryndarien now on trial for
the attack on Westruun, the party intercedes and

01:42:07.658 --> 01:42:13.814
proves his innocence. In thanks, Eskil uses his
talents to investigate the source of the blue

01:42:13.814 --> 01:42:21.375
crystal, revealing the powerful society of thieves,
known as the Clasp, responsible for its delivery.

01:42:21.427 --> 01:42:28.155
Vax, having previously been a member of the Clasp,
knows the main headquarters lies within the

01:42:28.155 --> 01:42:32.938
capital city of Emon, and Vox Machina sets out for
the west.

01:42:32.938 --> 01:42:38.430
ASHLEY: Upon arriving in the sprawling metropolis
of Emon, the party continues to hear of children

01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:44.115
disappearing, and reports of a black-haired,
golden-eyed boy befriending them before they

01:42:44.115 --> 01:42:50.891
vanish. While investigating, they do a few odd
jobs, one of which unexpectedly leads them to the

01:42:50.891 --> 01:42:59.998
home of Syldor, Vex and Vax's father, and his new
wife and child. Awkwardness aside, Syldor is here

01:43:00.046 --> 01:43:05.912
as ambassador to Syngorn, the elven city of their
origin, to seek aid from the Sovereign Uriel

01:43:05.912 --> 01:43:07.323
Tal'Dorei.

01:43:07.323 --> 01:43:12.980
However, the political climate of Emon is tense
with a recent, failed attempt on the royal

01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:19.837
family's life making Uriel unreachable at the
moment. Syldor's connection within the Council has

01:43:19.837 --> 01:43:25.750
now gone missing, and his mission stands at a
complete standstill. He hires the party to look in

01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:32.337
on this missing ally, Sir Gregory Fince, and get
his ear back to Syngornian business.

01:43:32.371 --> 01:43:38.976
Vox Machina finds Sir Gregory's home dark and
still, pushing them to infiltrate and investigate.

01:43:38.976 --> 01:43:44.926
Within, they discover a dark presence in the home,
leading them into a battle with demons in the

01:43:44.926 --> 01:43:52.361
basement. The battle won, Sir Gregory's tortured
corpse is found, as are his notes about the

01:43:52.361 --> 01:43:58.840
attempted assassination on Uriel and his family.
It seems that since the attempt, the royal family

01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:05.309
has grown strange and withdrawn, keeping Uriel
from the council most hours, and his wife now

01:44:05.309 --> 01:44:11.178
demanding she attend all meetings, whispering in
the Sovereign's ear and scoffing at the others who

01:44:11.178 --> 01:44:12.705
defy their decree.

01:44:12.705 --> 01:44:20.491
A General Krieg thwarted the attempt, and is
mentioned often. The party decides to inquire with

01:44:20.491 --> 01:44:26.795
him. On their way out of the basement, half of the
party falls into a trap, tumbling into a cistern

01:44:26.795 --> 01:44:32.956
and are flushed deep below into a subterranean
river system. The trapped party members-- Vex,

01:44:32.991 --> 01:44:40.701
Keyleth, Grog, Tiberius, and Percy-- come to rest
on a small island in the vast Crystalfen Lake,

01:44:40.756 --> 01:44:43.334
home to a terrible aboleth!

01:44:43.334 --> 01:44:50.112
Barely escaping, they eventually discover the base
remnants of an ancient town, long toppled, and a

01:44:50.112 --> 01:44:57.570
small hut that contains a clever hag named Trysta.
Tiberius finds one of his prized artifacts and

01:44:57.570 --> 01:45:05.045
makes a dangerous deal to acquire it. The party
barters for information on how to escape, which

01:45:05.045 --> 01:45:10.837
Trysta will give... in exchange for their aid in
slaying a newly nested denizen that threatens her

01:45:10.837 --> 01:45:18.522
work. The party agrees, climbing to the very top
of the Crystalfen Cavern to do battle with an

01:45:18.522 --> 01:45:24.231
umber-hulk. The fight goes south when Grog is
tossed from the cavern ceiling, nearly dying upon

01:45:24.231 --> 01:45:32.587
impact with the island, but victory is eventually
theirs. Returning, Trysta shows them a hidden

01:45:32.587 --> 01:45:36.957
staircase that exits into the Graveyard District
of Emon.

01:45:36.957 --> 01:45:42.413
TRAVIS: The other members-- Vax, Pike, and
Scanlan-- set out to find where the cistern could

01:45:42.413 --> 01:45:49.694
have drained to. Scanlan leaves to seek out a map
of the sewers, while Vax and Pike notice they are

01:45:49.694 --> 01:45:55.753
being followed through the town. Leading the
pursuers into an alley, the shadowed figures

01:45:55.753 --> 01:46:02.895
attack, eventually knocking them both out. Vax and
Pike awaken within the Clasp's headquarters,

01:46:02.895 --> 01:46:09.906
meeting with one of their leaders, or Spirelings,
named Modeth. The Clasp had Sir Gregory's home

01:46:09.906 --> 01:46:17.245
under surveillance, as bad political stuff can be
difficult for the way the Clasp does business, and

01:46:17.245 --> 01:46:22.339
when our heroes were spotted leaving, they had to
be interrogated.

01:46:22.339 --> 01:46:29.083
Vax reveals his membership to the Clasp sect in
Westruun, and Modeth calls for a test of their

01:46:29.083 --> 01:46:37.190
skills and intent. Pike and Vax are then forced to
do battle with a chained chimera in the Clasp's

01:46:37.190 --> 01:46:44.843
arena. Their might rings true, and the beast falls
beneath their weapons, but Modeth is not

01:46:44.843 --> 01:46:45.973
convinced.

01:46:45.973 --> 01:46:52.425
While the two are held overnight, they manage to
escape from the Clasp's lair, exiting into the

01:46:52.538 --> 01:46:59.541
night and managing to locate the rest of the party
in the Graveyard district. Knowing their next step

01:46:59.541 --> 01:47:06.105
is to speak with General Krieg, Vax forges a
letter of summons using Sir Gregory's handwriting,

01:47:06.105 --> 01:47:13.304
and the party is allowed entry into the carefully
guarded Cloudtop District, the innermost area of

01:47:13.304 --> 01:47:18.249
the city and home to the Citrine Garrison, as well
as Emon's Palace.

01:47:18.249 --> 01:47:24.204
Approaching the garrison, they have an audience
with General Krieg, who seems nice and keenly

01:47:24.204 --> 01:47:30.106
interested upon learning of the Clasp's
involvement. He also mentions the difficulty in

01:47:30.106 --> 01:47:36.821
talking with Uriel since the attack, and is sad
about the death of Sir Gregory, but warns to leave

01:47:36.821 --> 01:47:40.267
the investigation to the officials.

01:47:40.267 --> 01:47:48.063
Vox Machina then heads to the palace to try their
hand at speaking with Uriel, but entry is barred.

01:47:48.063 --> 01:47:54.627
They find another is being prevented from
entering, a golden-haired woman in fancy blue

01:47:54.627 --> 01:48:01.574
robes who angrily stomps away from the palace
doors. They engage her in conversation, and she

01:48:01.574 --> 01:48:10.342
reveals herself to be Allura Vysoren, a powerful
arcanist and member of the Tal'Dorei Council.

01:48:10.342 --> 01:48:17.658
They discuss the state of things within the
palace, how Uriel is a good and trusted man, but

01:48:17.658 --> 01:48:25.113
his actions (and those of the Empress Salda) are
recently suspect. After seven days of being kept

01:48:25.113 --> 01:48:31.851
from the council chambers, she's about to give up
and leave. The party tells her of their findings,

01:48:31.851 --> 01:48:37.794
and Allura leads them to her tower within the
district to further discuss the matter in

01:48:37.794 --> 01:48:39.213
private.

01:48:39.213 --> 01:48:44.177
SAM: Within, Allura and the party make an
alliance, and Keyleth aids her in performing a

01:48:44.177 --> 01:48:50.188
scrying ritual on the palace. The vision reveals
that the family of Uriel-- his wife, two

01:48:50.188 --> 01:48:56.570
daughters, and son-- are all under the influence
of some demonic force, and have addled the mind of

01:48:56.570 --> 01:49:00.587
their father, using him as a mouthpiece for their
plot.

01:49:00.587 --> 01:49:06.586
The party decides to pay a visit to the Clasp,
using Vax and Pike's knowledge of an entrance, and

01:49:06.586 --> 01:49:12.604
end up in a confrontation with Spireling Modeth
within his chambers. The battle ends with Modeth's

01:49:12.604 --> 01:49:18.574
head on the floor and four strange, glowing
crystals he had been keeping now stolen by the

01:49:18.574 --> 01:49:24.947
party. They attempt to leave, but are met by a
host of Clasp members and another,

01:49:24.947 --> 01:49:31.595
dangerous-looking Spireling. Through Scanlan's
deft lies and coercion, the party is allowed to

01:49:31.595 --> 01:49:35.092
leave unharmed before their deeds are discovered.

01:49:35.092 --> 01:49:40.479
They return to Allura's tower only to find the
front door ajar and the interior tossed by some

01:49:40.479 --> 01:49:46.436
previous scuffle. As they reach the top of the
tower, they investigate, finding signs of a

01:49:46.436 --> 01:49:53.111
struggle with a demonic entity, and Allura's
escape seemingly successful. Unfortunately, a

01:49:53.111 --> 01:49:58.895
magical defense of the tower is triggered, and it
begins to cave and crumble around them. Through

01:49:58.895 --> 01:50:05.600
some ingenuity-- and the discovery of a magic
carpet-- the party manages to escape being crushed

01:50:05.635 --> 01:50:11.820
within, Allura's ivory monolith now compacted into
a single, magical pearl.

01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:18.320
Our heroes then locate and enter the home of
General Krieg, finding a brainwashed servant and a

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:24.052
hidden passage that leads to a teleportation
circle. Using the device, they are transported to

01:50:24.052 --> 01:50:30.610
a distant cavern, high in a range of frost-covered
mountains, and an incredible hoard of gold,

01:50:30.610 --> 01:50:38.980
jewels, and fine trinkets. Across the room are
four obsidian orbs placed within the rock. As one

01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:44.884
is touched, a giant eye appears from within the
black crystal and a voice erupts, calling for a

01:50:44.884 --> 01:50:53.437
Brimscythe, and noticing the unfamiliar folk,
mentions, "Intruders... I know your face now. He

01:50:53.437 --> 01:51:02.189
"is a fool, and so are you, insect." The orbs all
crack simultaneously, becoming inert.

01:51:02.189 --> 01:51:08.804
Grog dives right in, rage-looting the gold, but
the arrival of the party seems to call the

01:51:08.804 --> 01:51:15.077
attention of General Krieg, who appears at the
teleportation circle. He angrily denounces the

01:51:15.077 --> 01:51:21.582
party and reveals his true form, that of a
frightening blue dragon!

01:51:21.582 --> 01:51:27.337
MARISHA: The battle is difficult, with many an
ally nearly devoured, but eventually Vax strikes a

01:51:27.337 --> 01:51:33.643
mortal blow. Krieg, or Brimscythe, defiantly
smashes against the support pillars of the cavern

01:51:33.643 --> 01:51:38.974
in his death throes, causing the chamber to
collapse, the party barely escaping via the

01:51:38.974 --> 01:51:40.774
teleportation circle.

01:51:40.774 --> 01:51:45.887
Leaving Krieg's home, Allura finds the party and
warns that the evil that feeds on the throne is

01:51:45.887 --> 01:51:51.654
growing more bold. She herself was attacked
shortly after the scrying was complete, and barely

01:51:51.654 --> 01:51:53.175
escaped.

01:51:53.175 --> 01:51:59.512
As dark clouds fill the sky above Emon, the party
decides the time to strike has come. Allura aids

01:51:59.512 --> 01:52:05.503
the party in infiltrating the palace, and they
storm the throne room. Uriel sits upon his throne,

01:52:05.503 --> 01:52:11.848
surrounded by his creepily mannered, possessed
family. Vox Machina attacks, managing to banish

01:52:11.848 --> 01:52:17.092
the shadows from within their bodies, but the
throne itself cracks in half as the dais below

01:52:17.092 --> 01:52:24.785
glows a deep red, summoning the entity behind the
entire scheme: a devil prince called Juurezel, who

01:52:24.785 --> 01:52:30.342
tells the party of a great war between devils and
demons spilling over into this plane, threatening

01:52:30.342 --> 01:52:36.810
all creation. He justifies his actions, and notes
all the demonic forces throughout the city, and

01:52:36.810 --> 01:52:41.582
tells them of the horrible devastation that will
ensue if the party stops him.

01:52:41.582 --> 01:52:46.938
They read him as honest, and Juurezel asks for
their aid in destroying the demonic threat,

01:52:46.938 --> 01:52:53.784
offering a single Wish should they make a pact.
The party deliberates and agrees to the contract.

01:52:53.784 --> 01:52:59.267
Thinking over what they had just agreed to, the
party returns to the throne room, asking for their

01:52:59.267 --> 01:53:05.469
Wish to be provided to aid them in their demon
hunting. Upon its casting, the party wishes to

01:53:05.469 --> 01:53:08.932
cancel their contract with the creature, and
attack!

01:53:08.932 --> 01:53:16.694
The devil prince angrily reveals his true form, a
hideous treachery demon, a glabrezu. A long,

01:53:16.694 --> 01:53:22.799
deadly, and epic confrontation ensues, one that
suddenly claims the life of the gnomish cleric,

01:53:22.799 --> 01:53:30.056
Pike. Her death fresh in their minds, Vox Machina
deals the killing blow, sending the demon to its

01:53:30.056 --> 01:53:32.206
unmaking.

01:53:32.206 --> 01:53:36.852
They gather up the cold body of their fallen
friend and rush her to a nearby temple of

01:53:36.852 --> 01:53:43.118
Sarenrae, where a resurrection ritual is
attempted... and succeeds.

01:53:43.118 --> 01:53:49.952
TALIESIN: The clouds disperse, the immediate
danger over, but the royal family lies on the

01:53:49.952 --> 01:53:57.534
throne room floor, catatonic. Upon inspection,
their souls are missing and their bodies failing.

01:53:57.534 --> 01:54:02.598
The party recalls the four glowing orbs they
recovered from the Clasp headquarters behind

01:54:02.598 --> 01:54:10.191
Modeth, now identified as soul jars, and through a
rigorous and tense evening, all souls are

01:54:10.191 --> 01:54:12.943
successfully restored to the family.

01:54:12.943 --> 01:54:19.048
A few days pass, and Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei
calls the party for audience. He thanks them all

01:54:19.048 --> 01:54:26.538
for their bravery, heroism, and for saving him,
his family, and quite possibly all of Emon. As

01:54:26.538 --> 01:54:32.092
thanks, he offers them a place on the Tal'Dorei
Council and informs them of his intent to throw

01:54:32.092 --> 01:54:36.909
another Winter's Crest festival to make up for the
ones ruined in Westruun, and here via

01:54:36.909 --> 01:54:42.282
assassination attempt, where they will be
celebrated as heroes! He has also commissioned the

01:54:42.282 --> 01:54:48.323
construction of a keep for them on the outskirts
of Emon as a sign of his very deep gratitude.

01:54:48.323 --> 01:54:55.528
A week later, the festival begins! The populace is
out in full force to meet and celebrate Vox

01:54:55.528 --> 01:55:02.668
Machina, but during the festivities, the party
notices Uriel's son Gren speaking to another

01:55:02.668 --> 01:55:11.139
child-- one with black hair and golden eyes. They
immediately spring to apprehend the child, but he

01:55:11.139 --> 01:55:17.714
escapes with Uriel's son. They give chase,
following him into an alley, and through a portal

01:55:17.714 --> 01:55:19.423
of some kind.

01:55:19.423 --> 01:55:25.608
The party finds themselves atop a large island
drifting through the Astral Plane, surrounded by a

01:55:25.608 --> 01:55:31.627
perilous bramble forest. They fight their way
through, eventually coming upon a gothic mansion

01:55:31.627 --> 01:55:37.755
towards the center of the landmass. Within, the
party makes their way to the inner library, where

01:55:37.755 --> 01:55:42.945
numerous kidnapped children are working all about
the place, cleaning nervously.

01:55:42.945 --> 01:55:49.588
The Dread Emperor, as he calls himself, stands
from his chair, the child illusion fading into a

01:55:49.588 --> 01:55:55.495
golden-armored man with long, black hair, four
children chained at the neck to his breastplate.

01:55:55.540 --> 01:56:01.299
He attacks the party with fierce magic,
mind-controlling all of his child servants to

01:56:01.299 --> 01:56:07.389
attack as well. With the first blow dealt, they
realize that damaging him also hurts the chained

01:56:07.389 --> 01:56:14.262
children, one boy accidentally falling in battle
to Keyleth's magic. Eventually, they succeeded in

01:56:14.262 --> 01:56:20.920
destroying the Dread Emperor and return to Emon
with a host of lost children, happily now found.

01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:26.668
Six months of peace follow as their new keep is
constructed, and the party scatters to their

01:56:26.668 --> 01:56:32.908
separate business until its completion. Upon their
return, they assess their new abode with delight,

01:56:32.908 --> 01:56:39.955
naming it Greyskull Keep. They then send out job
inquiries, seeking guards for hire, and servants.

01:56:39.955 --> 01:56:44.862
After an impromptu try-out, they settle upon their
new hires.

01:56:44.862 --> 01:56:51.823
MATT: That evening, the party receives a visitor
in their friend Arcanist Allura Vysoren. She

01:56:51.823 --> 01:56:57.594
happily sits with the party for dinner, and trades
tales of their past months, before asking if she

01:56:57.594 --> 01:57:04.661
could hire their services for a matter of great
personal importance. Allura's longtime friend and

01:57:04.661 --> 01:57:10.001
ally, Lady Kima of Vord, has gone missing,
following a vision quest from her deity, the

01:57:10.001 --> 01:57:16.027
platinum dragon Bahamut. Her last letter spoke of
an evil taking root beneath the dwarven city of

01:57:16.027 --> 01:57:23.351
Kraghammer, and Allura worries for her safety.
While Allura is unable to go herself, she can

01:57:23.351 --> 01:57:29.609
provide the proper paperwork for entry, and would
pay handsomely if they could find, aid, and return

01:57:29.609 --> 01:57:31.142
with Kima.

01:57:31.142 --> 01:57:38.027
Vox Machina agrees to the new contract and sets
out for the city of Kraghammer the very next day.

01:57:38.027 --> 01:57:46.029
As for the rest of their journey... the legend of
Vox Machina is still being written.

01:58:41.247 --> 01:58:46.217
MATT: Hello! And welcome back. I hope you guys
enjoyed your little look into the past of Vox

01:58:46.217 --> 01:58:52.087
Machina. Once again, thank you to everyone who
helped us with that. Huge thanks to Wendy. You

01:58:52.087 --> 01:58:55.891
were amazing in putting that together for us. It's
been a long-time endeavor coming.

01:58:55.891 --> 01:58:57.470
LIAM: We love you, Wendy.

01:58:57.470 --> 01:59:02.089
MATT: And all the wonderful Critters that are
incredibly talented put the music together and we

01:59:02.089 --> 01:59:06.781
are very thankful that you helped us fill out the
soundtrack. If you didn't catch all the names,

01:59:06.781 --> 01:59:09.580
they're at the bottom of the credits and hopefully
we'll have that video up separately on the website

01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:15.289
soon, so people who couldn't make it tonight will
have a chance to see it for their own. That being

01:59:15.289 --> 01:59:21.182
the case, when the rest of them decide they want
to join us, those who are going towards the pie

01:59:21.182 --> 01:59:26.457
eating contest. You start pushing through the
crowd, making your way towards the two long tables

01:59:26.457 --> 01:59:32.520
that are set up. At this, you can see there are a
pair of bakers that are standing there with stacks

01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:38.211
and stacks of various pies of various flavors they
have been preparing, all different colors and

01:59:38.211 --> 01:59:42.619
shapes, just pushed into a pile, as people are
gathered around, excitedly sitting at the table.

01:59:42.659 --> 01:59:46.240
LAURA: Is Trinket allowed to join in the pie
eating contest too?

01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:47.458
MATT: (laughs) You can ask.

01:59:47.458 --> 01:59:50.010
LAURA: (laughs) I do.

01:59:50.010 --> 01:59:54.605
MATT: Okay, one of the bakers is sitting there.
"All right, all right. So sit there, everyone's

01:59:54.605 --> 01:59:56.934
"got a table. We have room for about four more."

01:59:56.934 --> 01:59:57.807
LAURA: Oh.

01:59:57.807 --> 01:59:59.204
LIAM: Right here.

01:59:59.204 --> 02:00:00.514
MATT: "All right, three more."

02:00:00.514 --> 02:00:03.702
LAURA: And a bear. Is there room for a bear?

02:00:03.702 --> 02:00:06.383
MATT: "A bear. Like, a bear?"

02:00:06.383 --> 02:00:09.538
LAURA: Yeah, but a very human-acting bear.

02:00:09.538 --> 02:00:14.931
MATT: "Oh, sure. Bring him in. No! It's a bear!
Two more, room for two more."

02:00:14.931 --> 02:00:17.140
TRAVIS: Do you want me to join?

02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:20.178
LIAM: Can someone transmogrify Trinket, quickly?

02:00:20.178 --> 02:00:23.662
LAURA: (gasps) Can you Polymorph Trinket,
Keyleth?

02:00:23.662 --> 02:00:25.980
MARISHA: Into what?

02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:27.016
LAURA: A human.

02:00:27.016 --> 02:00:28.977
LIAM: To a hot man.

02:00:28.977 --> 02:00:30.023
TALIESIN: To a lumberjack.

02:00:30.023 --> 02:00:31.443
LAURA: Into a lumberjack of a man?

02:00:31.443 --> 02:00:33.439
MARISHA: I don't think it works that way.

02:00:33.439 --> 02:00:34.586
LAURA: Try it!

02:00:34.586 --> 02:00:35.890
TALIESIN: Old Spice commercial. Make it happen.

02:00:35.890 --> 02:00:36.871
MATT: You can certainly try.

02:00:36.871 --> 02:00:38.183
MARISHA: I try it.

02:00:38.183 --> 02:00:39.685
LIAM: Winter's Crest magic!

02:00:39.685 --> 02:00:43.712
MARISHA: I believe. I believe in the spirit of
Winter's Crest.

02:00:43.712 --> 02:00:47.283
LAURA: Can you Polymorph Trinket into a man?

02:00:47.283 --> 02:00:48.171
SAM: Sure.

02:00:48.171 --> 02:00:50.262
LAURA: Scanlan says he can.

02:00:50.262 --> 02:00:54.374
MARISHA: I think Scanlan actually might have a
better chance with Seeming?

02:00:54.374 --> 02:00:57.819
SAM: I can Polymorph Trinket.

02:00:57.819 --> 02:01:00.583
MARISHA: But can you Polymorph animals into
people?

02:01:00.583 --> 02:01:04.158
MATT: Technically, you could, yeah.

02:01:04.158 --> 02:01:05.082
MARISHA: I can?

02:01:05.082 --> 02:01:06.795
MATT: Technically. I don't see why not.

02:01:06.795 --> 02:01:16.388
MARISHA: Sure. Yeah, I'm going to make him real
beefy. He's got pecs that can lift semi-trucks.

02:01:16.388 --> 02:01:17.842
All right?

02:01:17.842 --> 02:01:19.060
MATT: Okay.

02:01:19.060 --> 02:01:24.560
MARISHA: Fur, just fur--

02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:26.779
SAM: Furry belly? What is that?

02:01:26.779 --> 02:01:31.816
MARISHA: Like that guy in the beginning of
Barbarella.

02:01:31.816 --> 02:01:35.124
MATT: So you turned your bear into a &lt;i&gt;bear.&lt;/i&gt;

02:01:35.124 --> 02:01:36.730
TALIESIN: Brian Blessed.

02:01:36.730 --> 02:01:37.829
MARISHA: Yes.

02:01:37.829 --> 02:01:40.085
LAURA: Here's my bear, right here.

02:01:40.085 --> 02:01:47.430
MATT: So you rush off and you come back with
Trinket. As you can see, he's walking a little

02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:58.371
strange and (bear moans) Rolls up and brushes his
scruffy man beard against the side of your face.

02:01:58.371 --> 02:02:03.811
You gather, Polymorph does not affect the
intellect of whatever you transform.

02:02:03.811 --> 02:02:08.902
LIAM: I grab a mug of ale and go: another one,
right? Yeah! He's had so many!

02:02:08.902 --> 02:02:10.530
LAURA: So drunk, this guy!

02:02:10.530 --> 02:02:15.609
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait. Grog, do we still have
that helmet, that pot that you wore on your head,

02:02:15.609 --> 02:02:17.275
in the Bag of Holding?

02:02:17.275 --> 02:02:18.190
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:02:18.190 --> 02:02:19.638
MARISHA: Can we have that real quick?

02:02:19.638 --> 02:02:22.642
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay. So I reach in and take out the
big bronze pot.

02:02:22.642 --> 02:02:24.314
MARISHA: I put the pot on his head.

02:02:24.314 --> 02:02:25.677
LAURA: Why?

02:02:25.677 --> 02:02:27.355
MARISHA: It's special.

02:02:27.355 --> 02:02:29.501
SAM: Oh, he has a helmet head?

02:02:29.501 --> 02:02:33.292
MATT: So the pot, which covers Trinket's head...
(bear moans)

02:02:33.292 --> 02:02:39.618
LAURA: He does not need a pot on his head.
Trinket, have a seat in this chair like a normal

02:02:39.618 --> 02:02:40.547
human.

02:02:40.547 --> 02:02:42.205
TRAVIS: You can give that back to me.

02:02:42.205 --> 02:02:43.041
LAURA: Here you go.

02:02:43.041 --> 02:02:44.489
LIAM: I keep giving him ale.

02:02:44.489 --> 02:02:53.657
MATT: Okay. (laughs) What is going on? Okay. So,
at this time, you guys have people gathered around

02:02:53.657 --> 02:02:59.651
now. You guys all take your places at the table.
You have to put your feet planted, everyone

02:02:59.651 --> 02:03:04.540
pushing elbow to elbow. You guys sit down amongst
yourselves in a cluster and you eventually guide

02:03:04.540 --> 02:03:11.403
over as your fourth at the end of your group, your
Polymorphed bear friend who's still (confused

02:03:11.403 --> 02:03:19.137
moans) messing with his manly ham hands.

02:03:19.137 --> 02:03:47.371
[no audio]

02:03:47.371 --> 02:03:49.066
MATT: "To eat..."

02:03:49.066 --> 02:03:52.438
LIAM: I do not have much confidence. You have
always eaten more than me, always.

02:03:52.438 --> 02:03:58.491
MATT: "Now!" Dive in face first, arms behind you,
just tearing through these pies. Just

02:03:58.491 --> 02:04:03.961
blackberries, strawberries, all forms of berries
just being tossed everywhere. There's a couple

02:04:03.961 --> 02:04:04.827
chicken pies--

02:04:04.827 --> 02:04:05.966
LIAM: No hands, no hands!

02:04:05.966 --> 02:04:07.063
LAURA: Oh, no hands?

02:04:07.063 --> 02:04:08.315
MATT: No hands, no.

02:04:08.315 --> 02:04:09.491
LAURA: Trinket, no hands.

02:04:09.491 --> 02:04:11.066
MATT: Trinket goes like, (inquisitive grunt).

02:04:11.066 --> 02:04:12.438
LAURA: No hands! No paws!

02:04:12.438 --> 02:04:15.150
MARISHA: (laughs) No paws! No paws!

02:04:15.150 --> 02:04:26.065
SAM: I'm going to use Message to communicate to
Grog: If there was ever a time for a prank,

02:04:26.065 --> 02:04:27.942
now is it.

02:04:27.942 --> 02:04:30.236
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

02:04:30.236 --> 02:04:40.519
MATT: As you all tear through your first large
pies, smeared across the faces, with your mind off

02:04:40.563 --> 02:04:45.613
to the side, you glance over, everyone go ahead
and make a constitution saving throw.

02:04:45.662 --> 02:04:50.935
SAM: Constitution? Oh, he's going to barf.

02:04:50.982 --> 02:04:52.770
LIAM: 20, Natural 20!

02:04:52.823 --> 02:04:55.818
LAURA: Oh, you rattled the table, it was 15, then
it fell over.

02:04:55.818 --> 02:04:57.911
LIAM: Oh, sorry, Charlie.

02:04:57.911 --> 02:05:03.422
LAURA: Seven for me, because he rattled the damn
table, because he's an asshole.

02:05:03.422 --> 02:05:05.131
LIAM: Yeah. Separate issues.

02:05:05.131 --> 02:05:09.647
LAURA: And then Trinket rolled a 21.

02:05:09.647 --> 02:05:10.863
MATT: All right, Grog?

02:05:10.863 --> 02:05:11.887
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm not eating.

02:05:11.887 --> 02:05:13.418
MATT: Oh, you're not eating?

02:05:13.418 --> 02:05:14.814
TRAVIS: I thought it was just you two guys.

02:05:14.814 --> 02:05:15.959
LAURA: It was us and Trinket.

02:05:15.959 --> 02:05:21.424
MATT: Okay, all right, cool. So, the three of you
tearing through. You finish the first pie. The

02:05:21.424 --> 02:05:28.337
second pies slam down, you all look at it, you
have a little moment. Close, but not too bad. You

02:05:28.337 --> 02:05:32.353
gather yourself and dive into a second round of
pies, splashing all over the table.

02:05:32.353 --> 02:05:34.646
LIAM: I elbow my sister, then dive into the pie.

02:05:34.646 --> 02:05:38.811
MATT: (laughs) Trinket is having a hard time
keeping the hands behind. You can see one of the

02:05:38.811 --> 02:05:41.930
bakers suddenly come by and hold the hands back.
(growls aggressively)

02:05:41.930 --> 02:05:44.137
LAURA: He's really drunk! Don't touch him too
much.

02:05:44.137 --> 02:05:46.059
MATT: "All right, just keep--"

02:05:46.059 --> 02:05:47.677
LAURA: No hands, Trinket.

02:05:47.677 --> 02:05:51.397
LIAM: He lost half his family here, in the attack
on Whitestone.

02:05:51.397 --> 02:05:58.258
MATT: More and more pie crust being tossed aside,
the table is a mess. The bakers are starting to

02:05:58.258 --> 02:06:04.589
scoop off whatever is left over off to the side
into buckets. As you finish the second pie, make

02:06:04.589 --> 02:06:08.264
another constitution saving throw with the DC
increasing with each progressive pie.

02:06:08.264 --> 02:06:10.122
LAURA: Oh. (laughs)

02:06:10.122 --> 02:06:11.087
TRAVIS: Wow.

02:06:11.087 --> 02:06:12.238
LAURA: Natural one for me.

02:06:12.238 --> 02:06:16.758
LIAM: Oh boy, I got a big six.

02:06:16.758 --> 02:06:18.006
MATT: All right.

02:06:18.006 --> 02:06:19.296
LAURA: Come on, Trinket!

02:06:19.296 --> 02:06:20.351
SAM: (whispers) Luck!

02:06:20.351 --> 02:06:23.468
LIAM: Yes, thank you, Scanlan. I got a big seven.

02:06:23.468 --> 02:06:25.049
(laughter)

02:06:25.049 --> 02:06:31.366
LAURA: 14 for Trinket. I rolled a one.

02:06:31.366 --> 02:06:36.707
MATT: Yeah. Okay, so as you both finish your
secondary pie, you both sit up and look at each

02:06:36.707 --> 02:06:43.426
other with dark purple berry filling down the side
of your face. You both make eye contact at the

02:06:43.426 --> 02:06:51.138
same time, as you both go (vomiting sound) and
release your fresh payload into the pans before

02:06:51.138 --> 02:06:57.716
you. Baker comes by, slamming the hand down.
"Disqualified!" You look around the side, you

02:06:57.716 --> 02:07:00.214
aren't the only ones. A number of other
individuals have dropped out now. You're down to

02:07:00.214 --> 02:07:03.685
five people at the table that are still eating,
one of which is Trinket, who finishes his second

02:07:03.685 --> 02:07:10.410
pie. Food smeared all across the face, getting all
in the beard. Some of it has dribbled down into

02:07:10.410 --> 02:07:14.684
the chest hair, it's a pretty terrifying sight.
Third pies are slammed down on the table.

02:07:14.684 --> 02:07:18.343
These last five individuals and Trinket.
Have Trinket roll another

02:07:18.343 --> 02:07:20.327
constitution saving throw.

02:07:20.327 --> 02:07:22.011
MARISHA: Come on, Trink!

02:07:22.011 --> 02:07:23.689
LAURA: You want to inspire him?

02:07:23.689 --> 02:07:26.752
MATT: You're adding your modifier, right?

02:07:26.752 --> 02:07:28.255
LAURA: 13.

02:07:28.255 --> 02:07:29.970
MATT: You're adding your modifier, right?

02:07:29.970 --> 02:07:30.922
LAURA: What modifier?

02:07:30.922 --> 02:07:31.935
MATT: His constitution modifier.

02:07:31.935 --> 02:07:32.771
LAURA: Yeah.

02:07:32.771 --> 02:07:45.474
MATT: All right, so this time, everyone finishes
this last pie. Two of the individuals end up

02:07:45.474 --> 02:07:50.330
having to stop, just duck out, have to run off out
into the crowd. Three of them make it through,

02:07:50.330 --> 02:07:56.380
Trinket just barely finishes the third pie.
(gulps, distressed growls) He gives you that look

02:07:56.380 --> 02:07:57.779
of like, (distressed growling).

02:07:57.779 --> 02:08:02.640
LAURA: Buddy. You can keep doing it! I'll give
you--

02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:04.080
SAM: Food?

02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:11.099
LAURA: I know, I got nothing. A nice nap. You can
have the bed tonight and I'll sleep on the floor.

02:08:11.099 --> 02:08:17.618
MATT: (pants) He looks over and another pie is set
down, the fourth round of pies go down. The last

02:08:17.618 --> 02:08:21.569
three and Trinket join in. Make another
constitution saving throw for Trinket.

02:08:21.569 --> 02:08:28.206
LAURA: Okay. It was almost a fucking 15. 15.

02:08:28.206 --> 02:08:30.295
MATT: A 15? Total?

02:08:30.295 --> 02:08:31.551
LAURA: Yeah. Oh no.

02:08:31.551 --> 02:08:39.568
MATT: That set of pies finished, two of the
remaining three end up getting up partway through

02:08:39.568 --> 02:08:43.890
the pie and one of them vomits off to the side.
The other one stops, stands up and walks away,

02:08:43.890 --> 02:08:50.654
going (distressed noises). Spits out the food in
his mouth in his hand, re-examining his life. The

02:08:50.654 --> 02:09:00.219
other remaining gentleman finishes the pie.
There's sweat down his face (panting), you see the

02:09:00.219 --> 02:09:03.990
little bit of a chinstrap beard he has just
covered in berries and bits of crust, this awful

02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:12.968
appearance. Trinket finishes the last bits of the
pie (chomp, distressed bellow).

02:09:12.968 --> 02:09:15.735
LAURA: Oh, I feel so guilty right now!

02:09:15.735 --> 02:09:17.892
LIAM: Why is he so good at being sad bear?

02:09:17.892 --> 02:09:20.067
LAURA: I know! Don't be sad bear, be happy bear!

02:09:20.067 --> 02:09:21.169
TRAVIS: 300 gold!

02:09:21.169 --> 02:09:22.361
LAURA: It's just 100 gold.

02:09:22.361 --> 02:09:23.967
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:09:23.967 --> 02:09:26.840
LAURA: Oh, a persuasion check for Trinket?

02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:27.874
MATT: Yeah.

02:09:27.874 --> 02:09:29.127
LAURA: So he'll keep eating?

02:09:29.127 --> 02:09:29.966
MATT: Yeah.

02:09:29.966 --> 02:09:35.695
LAURA: Oh, buddy. 15?

02:09:35.695 --> 02:09:39.031
MATT: 15. Trinket looks at you.

02:09:39.031 --> 02:09:40.451
LAURA: I love you.

02:09:40.451 --> 02:09:41.961
MATT: (distressed growls)

02:09:41.961 --> 02:09:44.398
MARISHA: You're like a Toddlers and Tiaras mom
right now.

02:09:44.398 --> 02:09:47.473
LAURA: I know. This is the worst. I'm the worst
mom.

02:09:47.473 --> 02:09:52.263
MATT: Looks down and across the table, the
gentleman who's also there scoots over right in

02:09:52.263 --> 02:09:59.760
front and goes, "May the best man win, eh?"
Trinket goes, (loud growl).

02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:03.068
LAURA: Get angry! Eat angry!

02:10:03.068 --> 02:10:11.027
MATT: There are bits of pie spattering across him
on the ground. Two pies (thud) brought down in

02:10:11.027 --> 02:10:14.907
front. These are not fruit pies. These are meat
pies.

02:10:14.907 --> 02:10:17.046
TRAVIS: Oh! That's so wrong!

02:10:17.046 --> 02:10:19.934
LAURA: That's okay, Trinket likes meat way more
than fruit.

02:10:19.934 --> 02:10:23.187
MATT: Then he goes, (distressed groans, sniffs).

02:10:23.187 --> 02:10:25.556
LAURA: Is it a salmon pie? He likes fish.

02:10:25.556 --> 02:10:27.615
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

02:10:27.615 --> 02:10:29.747
TRAVIS: With advantage, because it's meat?

02:10:29.747 --> 02:10:32.866
LAURA: Beause it's salmon. It's a salmon pie, and
he loves salmon.

02:10:32.866 --> 02:10:43.656
MATT: (pauses) Hold on. There do appear to be
hints of fish inside. I will grant you advantage

02:10:43.656 --> 02:10:45.572
on this saving throw.

02:10:45.572 --> 02:10:49.899
LAURA: Okay. Fucking balls, mother bitch.

02:10:49.899 --> 02:10:52.111
MARISHA: Advantage?

02:10:52.111 --> 02:10:55.530
LAURA: I did roll with advantage. 11.

02:10:55.530 --> 02:11:03.072
MATT: 11. Both of them dive into their pies,
coasting through. At a certain point, Trinket

02:11:03.072 --> 02:11:08.460
stops and (pants) breathes heavily in the pie. You
can see bits of it over the edge, just from the

02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:11.829
nostril flare, looks up at you (distressed
growl).

02:11:11.829 --> 02:11:13.510
LAURA: It's okay, buddy. It's okay.

02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:16.099
LIAM: I instinctively move behind Vex.

02:11:16.099 --> 02:11:24.303
MATT: The gentleman across the way looks up as
well and is like (pants heavily, groans). They

02:11:24.303 --> 02:11:27.942
both dive into the pies together again, slowly,
trying to make their way through and then in a

02:11:27.942 --> 02:11:32.857
moment, they both look up at each other and their
eyes make a connection as a look of sudden fear

02:11:32.857 --> 02:11:38.772
and realization hits both of them. They both sit
up and with but a moment's notice, the two bakers

02:11:38.772 --> 02:11:46.476
set down two pails at their side as both of them
simultaneously just... buckets. Losing

02:11:46.476 --> 02:11:53.363
simultaneously, at which point both of them raise
their other hand mid-expulsion. "We have a tie! A

02:11:53.363 --> 02:12:00.188
"victory! Both winners lasted quite a ways,
splitting the pot, that's 50 gold each." Everyone

02:12:00.188 --> 02:12:01.581
cheers, yay!

02:12:01.581 --> 02:12:05.003
ALL: Good job, Trinket!

02:12:05.003 --> 02:12:07.604
MATT: (weary growls)

02:12:07.604 --> 02:12:11.004
LAURA: You don't have to eat anything else if you
don't want to.

02:12:11.004 --> 02:12:11.987
MATT: (growls)

02:12:11.987 --> 02:12:12.929
LAURA: Okay.

02:12:12.929 --> 02:12:14.181
TRAVIS: He gets to sleep on the bed.

02:12:14.181 --> 02:12:16.950
LAURA: You get to sleep on the bed and I will
sleep on the damn floor.

02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:19.566
MATT: Trinket steps up and pushes away from the
guy and goes running towards you on his

02:12:19.566 --> 02:12:21.068
hands and knees.

02:12:21.068 --> 02:12:23.273
(laughter)

02:12:23.273 --> 02:12:27.179
MATT: (growls) Everyone goes like "Whoa-- " as he
runs by and starts nuzzling you.

02:12:27.179 --> 02:12:31.594
LAURA: Oh, this guy. This guy is so drunk!

02:12:31.594 --> 02:12:33.857
TRAVIS: There was some mold in those pies!

02:12:33.857 --> 02:12:38.632
MATT: The baker hands you a sack of gold. "For
your friend."

02:12:38.632 --> 02:12:39.734
LAURA: Thank you.

02:12:39.734 --> 02:12:41.340
MATT: When he's feeling better.

02:12:41.340 --> 02:12:43.733
TALIESIN: My favorite kind of pie.

02:12:43.733 --> 02:12:48.461
LIAM: I come over to my sister with two big mugs
of ale and hand one to her and say, here, don't

02:12:48.461 --> 02:12:51.566
swallow the first one, just swish around and spit
it out, then the rest.

02:12:51.566 --> 02:12:55.232
LAURA: Okay.

02:12:55.232 --> 02:12:57.550
LIAM: That's a good one.

02:12:57.550 --> 02:13:00.521
(laughter)

02:13:00.521 --> 02:13:05.678
MATT: At this point, you can now hear voices start
to raise, people going, "Oh, the Keeper, the

02:13:05.678 --> 02:13:09.075
"Keeper's going to speak." The people start
gathering towards the center of town where the Sun

02:13:09.075 --> 02:13:18.384
Tree is. As you all begin to gather for this
central moment of the festival, Keeper Yennen

02:13:18.384 --> 02:13:24.820
steps up. Cassandra steps up with him and you can
see he's looking over the crowd, eventually

02:13:24.820 --> 02:13:27.328
meeting Percy's gaze.

02:13:27.328 --> 02:13:29.809
TALIESIN: All right.

02:13:29.809 --> 02:13:35.457
MATT: He leads you up onto the stage. The three of
you stand out amongst the rest of the crowd as

02:13:35.457 --> 02:13:39.702
everyone gathers. The children are sitting in the
front, expectantly with their hands under their

02:13:39.702 --> 02:13:44.322
legs, looking up with big smiles. Some of them are
covered in candy and whatever else they've managed

02:13:44.322 --> 02:13:49.216
to acquire throughout the festival. The music
begins to slowly die down until silence hits and a

02:13:49.216 --> 02:13:53.893
small cold breeze begins to blow through, as you
see a couple of fresh flakes of snow begin to fall

02:13:53.893 --> 02:13:56.738
from the sky above Whitestone.

02:13:56.738 --> 02:14:06.241
The Keeper looks out over the crowd as the hush
takes the rest of the group. "Friends, families,

02:14:06.241 --> 02:14:17.876
"brave soldiers and defenders of this wondrous
city. We gather today to celebrate for the first

02:14:17.876 --> 02:14:28.091
"time in many years, our own Winter's Crest
festival." There's some clapping. "It is on this

02:14:28.091 --> 02:14:38.354
"day that we remember, centuries ago, when Erevan,
the Ice King, Keeper of the Far Realm of Ice and

02:14:38.354 --> 02:14:47.293
'the Elemental Planes, attempted to tear his way
into Tal'Dorei, was kept at bay and sent back

02:14:47.293 --> 02:15:01.019
"packing from whence he came." There are some
cheers from the crowd. "In this, we also are

02:15:01.019 --> 02:15:09.079
"reminded of family, reminded of friendship, and
the bonds that we as a people keep ourselves and

02:15:09.079 --> 02:15:19.172
"our families safe, that we rise up to the occasion
to show true heroism. To stand by our beliefs and

02:15:19.172 --> 02:15:28.298
"not let the darkness swallow our hope. And by
that, we are able to bring to you, this day, the

02:15:28.298 --> 02:15:33.581
"surviving members of the de Rolo family: Cassandra
and Percival."

02:15:33.581 --> 02:15:39.855
You hear some whistles from the crowd and some
cheers well up again. Some shouts, "de Rolo!"

02:15:39.855 --> 02:15:50.272
some yells from the crowd. Keeper Yennen puts his
arms out. "These two, among friends, Vox Machina,

02:15:50.272 --> 02:16:00.554
"the intrepid adventurers from Emon, spearheaded
our freedom, from the terrible, tyrant ruin that

02:16:00.554 --> 02:16:07.341
"the Briarwoods had set us upon. So today, we
celebrate not just our joint friendships. We

02:16:07.341 --> 02:16:17.404
"celebrate true heroism and give thanks that there
are still"-- looking to you, Percy-- "people who

02:16:17.404 --> 02:16:25.644
"will do whatever it takes to rise to the good of
this land." He looks to Cassandra. "Who in the

02:16:25.644 --> 02:16:33.411
"long run, know the right choices to make and
amongst the darkness, still choose sight of the

02:16:33.411 --> 02:16:43.671
"light. May we all raise our glasses to the
prosperous future of this city amongst the

02:16:43.671 --> 02:16:48.580
"Alabaster Sierras and to the continued future of
the de Rolo family."

02:16:48.580 --> 02:16:52.827
Everyone raises their glasses up. "Huzzah!"

02:16:52.827 --> 02:16:55.100
(cheering)

02:16:55.100 --> 02:17:00.913
MATT: Cheers, everyone drinks, the music swells
again, people begin to cheer and scatter and

02:17:00.956 --> 02:17:08.646
Keeper Yennen leads you guys off of the stage. The
rest of you gather up as some people come up and

02:17:08.646 --> 02:17:14.780
shake hands and express their gratitude and
thanks. As the crowd begins to die off a little

02:17:14.780 --> 02:17:26.040
bit, Keeper Yennen gives you all a look and
beckons you over. "If you wouldn't mind, a moment

02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:29.845
"of your time. I think there are a few things we
need to discuss."

02:17:29.845 --> 02:17:31.560
TALIESIN: Of course.

02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:37.845
MATT: "Cassandra?" She comes as well. And you all
step off out of the festival for a while. A few

02:17:37.845 --> 02:17:41.192
folks attempt to follow to see what's going on.
Some of the guards usher them away. You guys are

02:17:41.192 --> 02:17:47.141
led into an empty building, looks to have been a
home of some kind that has long since been

02:17:47.141 --> 02:17:53.455
abandoned. As you step inside, it's cold and still
in here, very low light other than a little oil

02:17:53.455 --> 02:18:00.919
lantern that's been lit by one of the guards as
you step inside. The door closes behind and Keeper

02:18:00.919 --> 02:18:07.779
Yennen turns around. "There is no real way that we
can show our appreciation for what you've done for

02:18:07.779 --> 02:18:19.232
"our people. But first and foremost, there are
funds within the de Rolo family treasury left

02:18:19.232 --> 02:18:26.657
"behind by the Briarwoods that we hope could help
compensate for some of your expenditures and

02:18:26.657 --> 02:18:28.703
'hardships you've undergone."

02:18:28.703 --> 02:18:30.586
LAURA: So many, just so many.

02:18:30.586 --> 02:18:36.058
MATT: "This is, of course, at the behest of the de
Rolo family,

02:18:36.058 --> 02:18:38.506
"who are the inheritors of this fortune."

02:18:38.506 --> 02:18:40.012
MARISHA: Thanks, Percy.

02:18:40.012 --> 02:18:41.932
LAURA: Percival, you're looking very attractive
today.

02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:43.223
TALIESIN: I know.

02:18:43.223 --> 02:18:45.911
TRAVIS: Very appropriate.

02:18:45.911 --> 02:18:57.652
MATT: "Now, we've had a few weeks of peace and
recovery, of rebuilding and reforging the real

02:18:57.652 --> 02:19:05.294
"bonds of this society here in Whitestone. But
going forward, there needs to be a governing

02:19:05.294 --> 02:19:16.541
"force. I would like to ask of your wisdom and
guidance, all of you, in deciding on what is to

02:19:16.541 --> 02:19:27.082
"become of the future of this city. There are many
options at our disposal. I'm overseeing a myriad

02:19:27.082 --> 02:19:34.690
"of things throughout the town and as a man of
religious importance, given the history, the

02:19:34.690 --> 02:19:40.322
"people have recommended it does not behoove me to
take any sort of position of ruling in this town.

02:19:40.322 --> 02:19:46.927
"It would be natural, of course, for the people to,
without question, follow anyone of the existing

02:19:46.927 --> 02:19:52.365
"bloodline." He looks both to Cassandra and to
Percival. "Have you any thoughts on this matter?

02:19:52.365 --> 02:19:54.902
"Any of you?"

02:19:54.902 --> 02:20:04.738
SAM: Of our members, only this one human over here
on his hands and knees, is the expendable one of

02:20:04.738 --> 02:20:05.708
our group.

02:20:05.708 --> 02:20:06.745
LAURA: Hey.

02:20:06.745 --> 02:20:12.251
MATT: At which point, the strange, burly man on
all fours, at this point, Brother-- who did not

02:20:12.251 --> 02:20:17.808
really notice, goes, "Is that your bear?"

02:20:17.808 --> 02:20:20.129
(laughter)

02:20:20.129 --> 02:20:21.273
LAURA: Maybe.

02:20:21.273 --> 02:20:23.129
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:20:23.129 --> 02:20:25.012
MATT: "Strange folk. "

02:20:25.012 --> 02:20:31.404
SAM: I don't think any of us would-- well, Percy,
if you'd like to stay and rule?

02:20:31.404 --> 02:20:33.838
LIAM: Freddy, this is everything you've worked
for.

02:20:33.838 --> 02:20:36.877
SAM: This is your birthright and you've earned
it.

02:20:36.877 --> 02:20:40.753
TALIESIN: It was really not my birthright. I was
not raised to rule.

02:20:40.753 --> 02:20:43.991
SAM: But you would be a fantastic ruler.

02:20:43.991 --> 02:20:48.673
MARISHA: And also sometimes, those birthrights are
thrust upon us.

02:20:48.673 --> 02:21:01.243
TALIESIN: I still have work to do outside the
city. Ripley's still on the loose and knows far

02:21:01.243 --> 02:21:13.022
too much. And I feel more than a little
responsible for her and what she may do. Honestly,

02:21:13.022 --> 02:21:17.008
Cassandra had a better upbringing than I did for
this sort of work.

02:21:17.008 --> 02:21:23.262
MATT: At which point, Cassandra pipes up and goes,
"Well, I understand what you're saying, brother,

02:21:23.262 --> 02:21:34.158
"but I'm still rediscovering who I am. If the
people of this town knew what I've done, what I

02:21:34.158 --> 02:21:37.209
"was responsible for all these years."

02:21:37.209 --> 02:21:44.748
MARISHA: You mean surviving being held hostage,
surviving an ambush and being pelted with arrows?

02:21:44.748 --> 02:21:51.629
TALIESIN: They expect better of us, I know. I
understand. We are held to a different standard.

02:21:51.629 --> 02:22:12.207
And it's difficult. Perhaps it's time for a
council. Perhaps it's time for shared rule. There

02:22:12.207 --> 02:22:22.997
should always be a de Rolo in Whitestone, but
perhaps we could share the weight.

02:22:22.997 --> 02:22:26.779
MATT: "We could. I could."

02:22:26.779 --> 02:22:30.874
TALIESIN: Yennen, would you be comfortable sharing
some of this burden?

02:22:30.874 --> 02:22:39.906
MATT: He's taken aback and thinks. "Well, in the
sense of a council that you're recommending, that

02:22:39.906 --> 02:22:47.551
"would be certainly a more comfortable position for
one such as myself. There are a number of

02:22:47.551 --> 02:22:58.942
"community leaders that have really stepped up and
shown their true quality. Yes, this could be done.

02:22:58.942 --> 02:23:07.129
"We'd have to ask the people, of course, of the
city and make sure that that would be all right

02:23:07.129 --> 02:23:14.274
"with the folks, but I think given the way things
have been, that shouldn't be too hard of a sell."

02:23:14.274 --> 02:23:19.616
LAURA: Do the de Rolos still stay in the giant
castle? Or does that go to somebody else, then?

02:23:19.616 --> 02:23:23.433
TALIESIN: I think the de Rolos keep the castle,
but I think we use the castle to--

02:23:23.433 --> 02:23:31.755
SAM: Wait, would you be on this council? And who
would they be counseling? Is there no superior

02:23:31.755 --> 02:23:35.088
primate? Is there no, there's no--

02:23:35.088 --> 02:23:39.406
MATT: "I believe what he's suggesting is that we
make decisions by council, by vote."

02:23:39.406 --> 02:23:41.581
SAM: A triumvirate.

02:23:41.581 --> 02:23:42.929
MATT: "If you will."

02:23:42.929 --> 02:23:44.258
TALIESIN: Quintumverate.

02:23:44.258 --> 02:23:45.202
SAM: Oh, four people?

02:23:45.202 --> 02:23:46.155
TALIESIN: Five.

02:23:46.155 --> 02:23:47.781
TRAVIS: A flatterdesplat.

02:23:47.781 --> 02:23:50.096
SAM: Flibbertigibbit.

02:23:50.152 --> 02:23:54.356
TALIESIN: A religious leader, someone from the
farming communities, someone from the economic

02:23:54.356 --> 02:23:56.809
community, someone from the trade community--

02:23:56.809 --> 02:23:58.377
SAM: Someone from the gnome community.

02:23:58.377 --> 02:23:59.491
TALIESIN: From the citizenry.

02:23:59.491 --> 02:24:02.555
SAM: From the gnome community.

02:24:02.555 --> 02:24:04.772
TALIESIN: From some known community, yes.

02:24:04.772 --> 02:24:07.433
SAM: I accept.

02:24:07.433 --> 02:24:19.839
TALIESIN: Interests will be thought of and there
will always be a noble to be a tiebreaker when

02:24:19.839 --> 02:24:28.035
necessary and to judge from a place of (sighs)
greater good.

02:24:28.035 --> 02:24:37.943
MATT: "Cassandra?" She steps back at this point
and she looks, her hands shaking visibly. She

02:24:37.943 --> 02:24:42.466
looks up to you and steps forward and reaches up
and puts her hand to the side of your face and

02:24:42.466 --> 02:24:57.259
looks to you with a piercing honesty and fear. She,
lower lip quivering, whispers to you. "Percy,

02:24:57.259 --> 02:25:02.119
"can I be trusted? Do you trust me?"

02:25:02.119 --> 02:25:07.163
TALIESIN: All things considered, I think that
you're more trustworthy than I am, at this point.

02:25:07.163 --> 02:25:13.699
Let's not forget that I was the one who let you
down first.

02:25:13.699 --> 02:25:17.667
I'm going to give her one of the stones.

02:25:17.667 --> 02:25:23.978
LAURA: We were-- no, that was for the whole group!
That was for the whole group, Percival.

02:25:23.978 --> 02:25:26.634
MATT: "What is this?"

02:25:26.634 --> 02:25:30.724
SAM: It's done.

02:25:30.724 --> 02:25:33.282
LIAM: Leave it alone.

02:25:33.282 --> 02:25:36.073
LAURA: (muffled) That's was going to save your
fucking life later.

02:25:36.073 --> 02:25:39.744
TALIESIN: You're going to be so happy when we have
instant access to the treasury.

02:25:39.744 --> 02:25:41.163
LAURA: All right.

02:25:41.163 --> 02:25:51.586
TALIESIN: If anything bad should happen, if
there's any need of quick retreat or quick

02:25:51.586 --> 02:26:00.513
communication, this is a one-way trip to us. And
in return, this is a one-way trip for us to you,

02:26:00.513 --> 02:26:02.785
in case of emergency.

02:26:02.785 --> 02:26:08.590
MATT: She clasps it in her hand, holds it to her
chest.

02:26:08.590 --> 02:26:19.096
TALIESIN: You were born for this. You were
instructed in how to do this, where I never was.

02:26:19.096 --> 02:26:22.801
LAURA: And now you've got four other people
keeping an eye on you.

02:26:22.801 --> 02:26:32.450
MATT: She smiles and closes her eyes. "What you
say is true." She looks over at each member of

02:26:32.450 --> 02:26:44.286
your group and looks back to Keeper Yennen. "If it
so pleases this intended council, It would be my

02:26:44.286 --> 02:26:50.423
"honor to represent the de Rolo bloodline in
keeping this town safe."

02:26:50.423 --> 02:26:58.315
Keeper goes, "Then so be it. I shall inquire with
the people of this town. We will forge a council

02:26:58.315 --> 02:27:10.172
"voted by the greater peoples of this place. And we
shall restore Whitestone to its former glory. Very

02:27:10.172 --> 02:27:15.375
"well. Go, enjoy the rest of your festival."

02:27:15.375 --> 02:27:21.344
SAM: What was that cash prize? You had mentioned
some sort of--

02:27:21.344 --> 02:27:23.514
MATT: "Well, talk with Percival."

02:27:23.514 --> 02:27:24.787
TALIESIN: I will organize--

02:27:24.787 --> 02:27:29.356
LAURA: Oh, you have to give it to us? It has to
come from you? That feels shady.

02:27:29.356 --> 02:27:37.112
TALIESIN: Let's not forget that within six hours
of meeting each other, I ended up handing over an

02:27:37.112 --> 02:27:39.268
enormous sum of money to you.

02:27:39.268 --> 02:27:40.894
LAURA: It was actually 500 gold.

02:27:40.894 --> 02:27:51.031
TALIESIN: It was quite a bit of gold, if I recall.
You have it written down, don't you? That's so

02:27:51.031 --> 02:27:52.588
endearing.

02:27:52.588 --> 02:27:54.494
LIAM: Is it?

02:27:54.494 --> 02:27:58.831
(laughter)

02:27:58.831 --> 02:28:06.186
MATT: "Very well. Enjoy your festival, you've
earned it. Go out, be merry. Let us all remember

02:28:06.186 --> 02:28:17.746
"this time of year, the bonds that we carry, the
loyalties that we hold to, and the heroism you

02:28:17.746 --> 02:28:23.985
"stand for. Now go." At which point, the guards
open the door and he steps out. The cold air

02:28:23.985 --> 02:28:27.388
rushes in, and you can see now, quite a bit of
soft snowfall is now coming upon

02:28:27.388 --> 02:28:29.406
the center of the town.

02:28:29.406 --> 02:28:33.276
LIAM: I'm sorry, is there a washroom here? My
sister's a little drunk and managed to yak on me a

02:28:33.276 --> 02:28:36.348
bit and I would really love to wash up a bit.
Anywhere nearby?

02:28:36.348 --> 02:28:43.121
MATT: He points off to the side. There's a small
bucket of cold water that's set by the side.

02:28:43.121 --> 02:28:45.084
LIAM: Okay, I use it.

02:28:45.084 --> 02:28:50.824
MATT: You manage to dampen your outfit to the
point of getting it off, although it is a bit cold

02:28:50.824 --> 02:28:52.534
when you step outside now.

02:28:52.534 --> 02:28:55.359
LAURA: Can I follow him for a moment?

02:28:55.359 --> 02:28:56.826
MATT: Sure.

02:28:56.826 --> 02:29:01.677
LAURA: I haven't talked to you very much lately.

02:29:01.677 --> 02:29:05.254
LIAM: No, you haven't.

02:29:05.254 --> 02:29:15.903
LAURA: You seem a bit off. Yeah. What's going on?

02:29:15.903 --> 02:29:23.418
LIAM: Nothing. I'm tired. We can relax for the
first time in weeks.

02:29:23.418 --> 02:29:29.714
LAURA: I noticed your girlfriend isn't talking to
you. Did you do something?

02:29:29.714 --> 02:29:42.368
LIAM: I will tell you just about everything, but I
don't think I want to talk about that.

02:29:42.368 --> 02:29:50.189
LAURA: All right. I leave, as well.

02:29:50.189 --> 02:29:55.799
MATT: All right. As the rest of the party joins,
you all step out into the cold afternoon air. You

02:29:55.799 --> 02:30:01.218
are immediately greeted by the sound of music,
laughter, and cheer. The rest of the festival

02:30:01.218 --> 02:30:08.935
continues on into dusk and you can't help but find
the joy in the air infectious.

02:30:08.935 --> 02:30:10.871
MARISHA: Percy.

02:30:10.871 --> 02:30:12.995
TALIESIN: Yes?

02:30:12.995 --> 02:30:15.505
MARISHA: I actually have a present for you.

02:30:15.505 --> 02:30:19.752
TALIESIN: Really?

02:30:19.752 --> 02:30:25.521
MARISHA: Yeah, it comes with a story.

02:30:25.521 --> 02:30:27.937
TALIESIN: (laughs) All right.

02:30:27.937 --> 02:30:32.819
MARISHA: You're the only one I-- should we go get
drinks? Maybe we should go get drinks first. Let's

02:30:32.819 --> 02:30:35.261
go get drinks and then I'll give you your
present.

02:30:35.261 --> 02:30:36.781
TALIESIN: All right. In that case--

02:30:36.781 --> 02:30:39.067
MARISHA: Alcohol makes everything better.

02:30:39.067 --> 02:30:41.350
TALIESIN: Alcohol does make everything better.

02:30:41.350 --> 02:30:46.723
LAURA: Speaking of presents, even though you're
being kind of a dick.

02:30:46.723 --> 02:30:49.475
LIAM: Wow, you ran fast to catch up with me.

02:30:49.475 --> 02:30:58.383
LAURA: I was going to buy you something, but then
I realized sometimes old is better than new.

02:30:58.383 --> 02:31:02.352
SAM: It's an old person.

02:31:02.352 --> 02:31:04.387
(laughter)

02:31:04.387 --> 02:31:05.686
MATT: Vox Machina's favorite!

02:31:05.686 --> 02:31:06.661
MARISHA: Kill it!

02:31:06.661 --> 02:31:08.425
LIAM: Already dead.

02:31:08.425 --> 02:31:20.252
LAURA: You know what that is?

02:31:20.277 --> 02:31:29.070
MATT: As you open the package, you see before you,
a familiar belt of leather, with a coiled snake on

02:31:29.070 --> 02:31:33.270
the buckle.

02:31:33.270 --> 02:31:35.508
SAM: How did you get that?!

02:31:35.508 --> 02:31:37.209
LAURA: I've got ways.

02:31:37.209 --> 02:31:40.251
SAM: It was in Uriel's palace, wasn't it?

02:31:40.251 --> 02:31:42.908
LAURA: I'm a really good winker, if you haven't
noticed.

02:31:42.908 --> 02:31:44.137
TRAVIS: She is.

02:31:44.137 --> 02:31:50.416
SAM: Did you wink somebody for that? You slutty
little thing.

02:31:50.416 --> 02:31:52.280
LAURA: (laughs)

02:31:52.280 --> 02:31:56.381
LIAM: Hello, Simon. (slithering sound)

02:31:56.381 --> 02:31:58.816
(laughter)

02:31:58.816 --> 02:32:02.548
SAM: Oh no, it's just a real snake, it's biting
you!

02:32:02.548 --> 02:32:06.887
TRAVIS: Revenge achieved!

02:32:06.887 --> 02:32:25.222
LIAM: I am too embarrassed to look her in the eye,
and stare for a moment, but then finally, still

02:32:25.222 --> 02:32:32.901
not looking at her because she's fucking freaking
me out, pull her into a hug and say, I love you,

02:32:32.901 --> 02:32:43.987
Stubby. I'm never going to leave your side, I'm
always going to be there. You can always be a pain

02:32:43.987 --> 02:32:53.411
in the ass like you are. I love you. Always have,
always will. Thank you.

02:32:53.411 --> 02:32:56.964
LAURA: Thank you. And then I slap him across the face.

02:32:57.006 --> 02:33:00.000
LIAM: What the fuck was that for?

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:05.071
LAURA: I love you, too.

02:33:05.071 --> 02:33:17.179
MARISHA: When I was helping the farmers clean up,
I had this strange moment where I was walking

02:33:17.179 --> 02:33:22.169
through the field and saw a dead raven.

02:33:22.169 --> 02:33:23.819
SAM: Here it is.

02:33:23.819 --> 02:33:33.707
MARISHA: (laughs) More or less. It caught my
attention and it made me think about the past

02:33:33.707 --> 02:33:41.612
several weeks, what we've been through and
everything. Don't know-- who knows, it probably

02:33:41.612 --> 02:33:48.918
died, actually, in the rebellion. Maybe my ice
storm killed it or something.

02:33:48.918 --> 02:33:51.193
TALIESIN: You're doing very well.

02:33:51.193 --> 02:34:06.407
MARISHA: Thanks. I was looking at it and it
reminded me of everything and I feel like I was

02:34:06.407 --> 02:34:13.142
instantly trying to forget about everything
because I don't want to remember. But we should.

02:34:13.142 --> 02:34:26.256
And I don't want to remember you the way you were.
Because it was scary, and I didn't like it. I like

02:34:26.256 --> 02:34:42.342
you now. So I took the dead bird and cleaned it
and kept its skull and put it in this box for you,

02:34:42.342 --> 02:34:56.149
as a reminder of what you could have become. What
any of us could have become, really, at any time.

02:34:56.149 --> 02:35:03.600
Because we shouldn't forget.

02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:07.775
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:35:07.775 --> 02:35:14.990
MARISHA: It's a little macabre and I would have
bought things, but we're out of money.

02:35:14.990 --> 02:35:19.169
TALIESIN: I won't forget.

02:35:19.169 --> 02:35:26.442
MARISHA: I'm glad that's not you.

02:35:26.442 --> 02:35:39.638
TALIESIN: I can't even think of what the revenge
felt like anymore. It's not... it doesn't weigh on

02:35:39.638 --> 02:35:43.138
me. Just regret.

02:35:43.138 --> 02:35:47.794
MARISHA: Regret?

02:35:47.794 --> 02:35:57.122
TALIESIN: Of how much better I could have been.
Thank you. I will try to be better.

02:35:57.122 --> 02:36:04.821
MARISHA: No better than you could have been.
There's still a lot to come, you know.

02:36:04.821 --> 02:36:06.940
TALIESIN: That's my plan.

02:36:06.940 --> 02:36:17.384
MARISHA: I think we all wish we were better than
we could have been. Seeing that bird, I'm sure the

02:36:17.384 --> 02:36:22.836
bird felt the same way. But fuck it, he's dead
now.

02:36:22.836 --> 02:36:26.259
TALIESIN: (laughs) You're strange, you know that?

02:36:26.259 --> 02:36:27.656
MARISHA: I know, I'm sorry.

02:36:27.656 --> 02:36:30.944
TALIESIN: No, we like it. Don't change.

02:36:30.944 --> 02:36:34.083
MARISHA: I'm glad you didn't change.

02:36:34.083 --> 02:36:42.700
SAM: Grog, I got you an Amazon gift card. It's a
forest called the Amazon. You can go there and get

02:36:42.700 --> 02:36:43.889
a gift.

02:36:43.889 --> 02:36:45.291
TRAVIS: Is it far?

02:36:45.291 --> 02:36:47.097
SAM: Oh, really far, you'll never use it.

02:36:47.097 --> 02:36:52.725
TRAVIS: Re-gift!

02:36:52.725 --> 02:36:58.802
LIAM: Well guys, Vox Machina is now free and clear
of all evil influence.

02:36:58.802 --> 02:37:00.652
(laughter)

02:37:00.652 --> 02:37:04.274
MARISHA: No shadowy demons. Feels good.

02:37:04.274 --> 02:37:06.390
TRAVIS: Feels good!

02:37:06.390 --> 02:37:10.389
MATT: With that, Vox Machina continues to enjoy
the joyous affair that is the Winter's Crest

02:37:10.389 --> 02:37:20.508
festival. Snowfall slowly covering the night sky
as the sun comes to dusk. You withdraw to tell

02:37:20.508 --> 02:37:24.953
stories, sing songs, and drink merrily as the
friends you are, looking forward to the next

02:37:24.953 --> 02:37:29.947
chapter in your adventure. And with that, we're
going to go ahead and close the Winter's Crest

02:37:29.947 --> 02:37:36.267
episode of our adventure and leave you guys to the
holiday break. We have a couple cool announcements

02:37:36.267 --> 02:37:41.789
to make. One, we had our winner earlier from our
subscriber count, we hit a hundred. Our winner, if

02:37:41.789 --> 02:37:44.773
they haven't already announced it, is
Saxecutioner.

02:37:44.773 --> 02:37:46.750
SAM: Saxecutioner.

02:37:46.750 --> 02:37:55.282
MATT: You'll get yourself a cool care package
we're going to ship out to you.

02:37:55.282 --> 02:37:57.630
MARISHA: I think the Boonzy Arts candle is going
out.

02:37:57.630 --> 02:37:58.700
MATT: Yes!

02:37:58.700 --> 02:38:01.322
TALIESIN: Boonzy Arts candle. Scent-sy
Saxecutioner.

02:38:01.322 --> 02:38:07.302
MATT: Indeed, indeed. Let's see, we'll be gone for
a few weeks until we come back for our next

02:38:07.302 --> 02:38:10.099
episode. We're on our holiday break, we're going
to get our stuff taken care of, but we'll be back

02:38:10.099 --> 02:38:11.254
as soon as we can.

02:38:11.254 --> 02:38:12.700
LAURA: Do we know what date that is going to be
at?

02:38:12.700 --> 02:38:15.183
LIAM: I mean, we come back next Thursday, right?
Again, right? We play again every week. Every

02:38:15.183 --> 02:38:16.583
Thursday.

02:38:16.583 --> 02:38:18.666
ZAC: The seventh.

02:38:18.666 --> 02:38:23.959
MATT: The seventh. And I think Zac has something
you wanted to mention.

02:38:23.959 --> 02:38:26.210
TALIESIN: Did you have a thing, Zac?

02:38:26.210 --> 02:38:28.923
MATT: Come on in, buddy.

02:38:28.923 --> 02:38:36.035
ZAC: So, I have fairly serious announcement, I
guess. Hopefully our cameraman Ryan already left

02:38:36.035 --> 02:38:41.094
for Star Wars. And sorry to like pull the rug out
from under you guys, but this is officially my last

02:38:41.128 --> 02:38:50.665
Critical Role in person. I have been hired to be
CEO of a new media company in collaboration with

02:38:50.665 --> 02:38:57.216
Harebrained Schemes, up in Seattle. And I start on
January first. So, this is my last one, so I just

02:38:57.216 --> 02:39:02.619
wanted to tell you guys, thank you. Thank you to
the community. This has been one of the most

02:39:02.619 --> 02:39:08.514
amazing years of my life. It's been really cool to
see what we've accomplished as a community, as a

02:39:08.514 --> 02:39:15.458
group, being cool on the internet and not dicks
has been really cool. As an audience, like you

02:39:15.458 --> 02:39:20.905
guys and all of us and the amount of money we've
been able to raise for charity. I can promise you

02:39:20.905 --> 02:39:28.051
that the channel's fine, the shows are fine.
Lucas will be taking over the commander-in-chief

02:39:28.051 --> 02:39:30.227
position, so Lucas!

02:39:30.227 --> 02:39:31.375
MARISHA: Lucas!

02:39:31.375 --> 02:39:32.626
TALIESIN: Lucas!

02:39:32.626 --> 02:39:34.920
ZAC: Most people don't know--

02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:37.455
MARISHA: The man behind the curtain.

02:39:37.455 --> 02:39:40.144
ZAC: The man that runs the boards. So Lucas is
getting a promotion.

02:39:40.144 --> 02:39:41.579
MATT: Yes.

02:39:41.579 --> 02:39:43.150
ZAC: He's back there.

02:39:43.150 --> 02:39:45.478
LAURA: I see his legs. He's not walking this way.

02:39:45.478 --> 02:39:52.909
ZAC: He's not moving. Tomorrow, we're going to
have a big party. It's going to be my last stream

02:39:52.909 --> 02:39:58.711
on Geek and Sundry. It's going to be a big party
to celebrate. It'll be a lot of fun.

02:39:58.711 --> 02:40:04.101
We're going to do some dancing, we'll have
some special guests coming by. And he's going to

02:40:04.101 --> 02:40:08.514
widen the camera just so he can get in the shot.
We're also going to be knighting Lucas tomorrow

02:40:08.514 --> 02:40:13.334
night, so you guys should definitely tune in for
that and watch us knight Lucas. We've been

02:40:13.334 --> 02:40:19.831
training him up, getting him ready. But again,
thank you everyone for this amazing experience.

02:40:19.831 --> 02:40:26.734
You can follow me on Twitter if you want to know
more about what's coming up. It'll be in a couple

02:40:26.734 --> 02:40:31.529
of months, we'll be launching that and I'll make
sure to keep streaming on my channel and Lucas, of

02:40:31.529 --> 02:40:37.022
course, will continue the spirit. We'll still be
in communication, everything's good. So you know.

02:40:37.022 --> 02:40:38.809
(laughter)

02:40:38.809 --> 02:40:43.225
ZAC: There's no hard feelings at all. I'm not
dumping a load of shit on him and walking away.

02:40:43.225 --> 02:40:44.488
LUCAS: We'll figure it out.

02:40:44.488 --> 02:40:49.504
ZAC: We'll figure it out. Everybody, so thank you
guys so much. I don't really have anything more to

02:40:49.504 --> 02:40:50.867
say other than thank you.

02:40:50.867 --> 02:40:53.384
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Overlord, Overlord.

02:40:53.384 --> 02:41:00.391
MATT: I don't think you guys truly, as an audience
understand exactly how much he's done to build

02:41:00.391 --> 02:41:03.076
this channel, the blood, sweat, and tears. I mean,
both of them!

02:41:03.076 --> 02:41:06.768
ZAC: Literally, not figuratively.

02:41:06.768 --> 02:41:11.864
MATT: Zac has made us all feel so comfortable and
so excited to create this whole thing and has

02:41:11.864 --> 02:41:16.188
given so much of himself and put so much of
himself into this and really, if you have the

02:41:16.188 --> 02:41:20.243
opportunity on Twitter or wherever else to follow
him to his new job, let him know and feel the

02:41:20.243 --> 02:41:24.328
appreciation. He's awesome and an amazing human
being and we're going to miss him terribly. But

02:41:24.328 --> 02:41:26.303
we're so happy and excited for your new ventures.

02:41:26.303 --> 02:41:27.201
ZAC: Yes!

02:41:27.201 --> 02:41:31.219
(Overlord theme)

02:41:31.219 --> 02:41:33.987
ZAC: I'm going to exit on that.

02:41:33.987 --> 02:41:36.320
LAURA: Huzzah to Zac!

02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:41.239
ALL: Huzzah! Huzzah to Zac!

02:41:41.239 --> 02:41:42.708
MATT: All righty.

02:41:42.708 --> 02:41:47.313
LAURA: It's still going.

02:41:47.313 --> 02:41:55.153
MATT: There we go. Cross straight over. That song
goes on for a while, too. There you go. All right,

02:41:55.153 --> 02:42:01.409
so. One more quick little exit here for you guys
before we go on holiday break, we've had a special

02:42:01.409 --> 02:42:07.625
guest, came in today to check out the stream. Big
fan of his work for a very long time and extremely

02:42:07.625 --> 02:42:12.591
proud he came to watch the episode and he's been
live-tweeting throughout the evening, but he wants

02:42:12.591 --> 02:42:16.853
to come in and give a little holiday hello as
well. We have to the cameras, come sit next to me in

02:42:16.853 --> 02:42:19.550
this chair, the illustrious Chris Perkins.

02:42:19.550 --> 02:42:23.294
(cheering)

02:42:23.338 --> 02:42:25.983
MATT: It's everything I hoped it would be!

02:42:25.983 --> 02:42:27.982
LIAM: He's made of dice!

02:42:27.982 --> 02:42:29.803
CHRIS: What's on tap for next year?

02:42:29.803 --> 02:42:33.548
MATT: Oh, you'll find out. It's all positive!

02:42:33.548 --> 02:42:34.517
CHRIS: Oh, really?

02:42:34.517 --> 02:42:35.695
MATT: No.

02:42:35.695 --> 02:42:37.008
CHRIS: I have some suggestions.

02:42:37.008 --> 02:42:37.897
MATT: Okay, we'll talk.

02:42:37.897 --> 02:42:40.376
(laughter)

02:42:40.376 --> 02:42:41.595
TRAVIS: Let us live!

02:42:41.595 --> 02:42:42.866
LAURA: He's going to kill us all!

02:42:42.866 --> 02:42:47.183
MARISHA: I will say, I feel like the DM power, the
balance--

02:42:47.183 --> 02:42:48.540
LAURA: It's over 9000!

02:42:48.540 --> 02:42:49.735
MARISHA: It's over 9000!

02:42:49.735 --> 02:42:51.051
TRAVIS: It's like if suns meet.

02:42:51.051 --> 02:42:53.009
MATT: Terrible things happen behind this.

02:42:53.009 --> 02:42:55.256
CHRIS: This is a real treat for me, thank you.
Thank you everybody.

02:42:55.256 --> 02:42:57.108
MATT: Thanks for coming, sincerely.

02:42:57.108 --> 02:42:58.426
CHRIS: No, this is magic.

02:42:58.426 --> 02:42:59.992
MATT: Go ahead and roll this for a second. I'm
just curious.

02:42:59.992 --> 02:43:01.431
CHRIS: Okay. Whoa.

02:43:01.431 --> 02:43:11.265
MATT: Yeah, it's a fan-made die. All right, yeah.
It's a 15. Oh wait. It's like a Sputnik die. So he

02:43:11.265 --> 02:43:16.589
rolled a 15. That's DM rolling right there. That's
upper teens, yo.

02:43:16.589 --> 02:43:18.437
CHRIS: I rolled a 20.

02:43:18.437 --> 02:43:26.035
MATT: Oh, there we go. See, there we go. Natural
20. Thank you so much for coming by, man.

02:43:26.035 --> 02:43:26.934
Seriously.

02:43:26.934 --> 02:43:33.625
CHRIS: I really appreciate it. It was great to
hang out. Watch the magic happen. My favorite

02:43:33.625 --> 02:43:38.028
quote of the night was, "Don't be sad bear, be
happy bear."

02:43:38.028 --> 02:43:41.463
(laughter)

02:43:41.463 --> 02:43:44.718
CHRIS: I'm going to use that one. Take that one
back with me.

02:43:44.718 --> 02:43:49.038
MATT: Go for it. So guys, next year, look forward
to the next Dungeons and Dragons module,

02:43:49.038 --> 02:43:50.791
"Don't Be Sad Bear."

02:43:50.791 --> 02:43:52.508
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:43:52.508 --> 02:43:57.901
MATT: I think it's for levels three to seven.
It'll be really great. For those who aren't

02:43:57.901 --> 02:44:04.078
familiar with Chris, he's been a longtime dungeon
master inspiration for a lot of us out there,

02:44:04.078 --> 02:44:10.139
who's put up a blog for a long time with a lot of
great tips and tricks and discussions on what

02:44:10.139 --> 02:44:14.705
makes a great story, what makes running a great
game. If you aren't following him right now, you

02:44:14.705 --> 02:44:16.902
should, on Twitter at--

02:44:16.902 --> 02:44:18.516
CHRIS: I don't know.

02:44:18.516 --> 02:44:20.228
TRAVIS: Oh no!

02:44:20.228 --> 02:44:21.697
CHRIS: @ChrisPerkinsDnD.

02:44:21.697 --> 02:44:26.662
MATT: There you go. So, that should work out well.
Thank you so much for coming.

02:44:26.662 --> 02:44:27.614
CHRIS: Thank you.

02:44:27.614 --> 02:44:31.426
MATT: I appreciate that. And guys, happy holidays
and happy New Year. We'll see you--

02:44:31.426 --> 02:44:38.247
ZAC: I forgot, I have one more quick announcement.
I can't believe I forgot this. So, I was talking

02:44:38.247 --> 02:44:43.569
to the mods about it and some other people, maybe
I told them. So I'm going to challenge you guys in

02:44:43.569 --> 02:44:50.354
the chat, my one last final challenge to you all.
I am going to get a tattoo to commemorate my year

02:44:50.354 --> 02:44:57.236
at Geek and Sundry here. And I would like that to
be of you guys's design. So I'm going to challenge

02:44:57.236 --> 02:45:04.541
you guys on the internet to tag me and a week from
today, I will Periscope me getting a tattoo that

02:45:04.541 --> 02:45:08.388
someone in the chat room designed. Most likely a
Snugglelord; it'd be cool if it was a

02:45:08.388 --> 02:45:09.751
Snugglelord.

02:45:09.751 --> 02:45:12.788
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure I'm going to draw you a
cock and balls.

02:45:12.788 --> 02:45:17.827
ZAC: Travis wants me to tattoo a cock and balls.
So, as long as it can be a cock and balls with

02:45:17.827 --> 02:45:18.847
Travis's face.

02:45:18.847 --> 02:45:21.115
MATT: I'll vote for that.

02:45:21.115 --> 02:45:23.397
TRAVIS: A big veiny triumphant bastard.

02:45:23.397 --> 02:45:27.699
MARISHA: How about Snugglelord riding Travis's
cock and balls?

02:45:27.699 --> 02:45:34.459
ZAC: You've been challenged. You've been
challenged. But I definitely want to do that to

02:45:34.459 --> 02:45:41.566
always have with me a little memory from this last
year. I really honestly can't tell you guys how

02:45:41.566 --> 02:45:46.748
much this year meant to me and I want to make sure
that I will never forget, even if my brain starts

02:45:46.748 --> 02:45:48.829
to fall away. I'll be like, oh look, Travis's--

02:45:48.829 --> 02:45:50.740
LAURA and MARISHA: Cock and balls.

02:45:50.740 --> 02:45:52.194
TRAVIS: He was so good at Halo.

02:45:52.194 --> 02:45:53.241
MATT: Yeah.

02:45:53.241 --> 02:45:55.442
(laughter)

02:45:55.442 --> 02:46:00.762
MATT: Well, nothing could possibly go wrong with
that. So go ahead and get your designs together,

02:46:00.762 --> 02:46:06.302
submit those and see if you could be responsible
for designing a permanent piece of illustrious

02:46:06.302 --> 02:46:12.195
Overlord's body. Wow. I'm excited for that now.

02:46:12.195 --> 02:46:14.068
TRAVIS: Let's let the gates open.

02:46:14.068 --> 02:46:16.436
MATT: Exactly. You guys, happy holidays.

02:46:16.436 --> 02:46:19.789
MARISHA: One more announcement. Sorry, I lied, one
more.

02:46:19.789 --> 02:46:22.910
MATT: This is like Lord of the Rings. This is
Return of the King. It's got seven endings.

02:46:22.910 --> 02:46:29.422
MARISHA: Yeah, well, it's going to be a double
feature. There will be a finale to the comic strip

02:46:29.422 --> 02:46:34.661
of the Winter's Crest festival, so keep checking
the Geek and Sundry website because I believe it's

02:46:34.661 --> 02:46:39.450
going to go up on Christmas Eve, actually. So
yeah, check it out.

02:46:39.450 --> 02:46:40.505
MATT: Fantastic.

02:46:40.505 --> 02:46:41.736
MARISHA: Still more stuff.

02:46:41.736 --> 02:46:43.167
MATT: All right. Anyone else?

02:46:43.167 --> 02:46:46.951
LAURA: Is there going to be a Critical Role
marathon or something coming up soon?

02:46:46.951 --> 02:46:50.103
MATT: Are you guys playing Critical Role over the
holidays?

02:46:50.103 --> 02:46:52.600
LUCAS: At some point.

02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:54.127
MATT: At some point, there'll be a marathon.

02:46:54.127 --> 02:46:55.797
TALIESIN: What a perfect time to get your friends
hooked.

02:46:55.797 --> 02:46:58.480
MATT: There you go, it'll be on the Twitter.

02:46:58.480 --> 02:47:00.329
ZAC: Lucas will let you know when it's up.

02:47:00.329 --> 02:47:01.746
MATT: Lucas will let you know.

02:47:01.746 --> 02:47:03.541
MARISHA: There is a bajillion hours' worth.

02:47:03.541 --> 02:47:08.489
LUCAS: So, the plan is, the mods will be creating
a Twitch playlist, so it won't show up as us being

02:47:08.489 --> 02:47:13.359
online. It will say we're offline, but you can
come to our actual Twitch page and there will be

02:47:13.359 --> 02:47:18.748
marathons of each show individually. Critical Role
will be later on. It's not going to be the first

02:47:18.748 --> 02:47:24.120
one that we marathon and that will be for probably
a week and a half until I get into the studio and

02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:31.976
make actual playlists and you'll get that e-mail
that says-- probably not Critical Role, but just

02:47:31.976 --> 02:47:38.446
an entire streaming marathon-- I don't even know.
I'll figure it out. I've got a week and a half to

02:47:38.446 --> 02:47:42.829
figure it out, but there will be a playlist coming
right up. Next Monday.

02:47:42.829 --> 02:47:45.154
LAURA: All right! Good announcement! Good job!

02:47:45.154 --> 02:47:48.006
(cheering)

02:47:48.006 --> 02:47:49.722
TALIESIN: Hail the new king!

02:47:49.722 --> 02:47:51.592
ZAC: First announcement!

02:47:51.592 --> 02:47:53.161
MATT: They grow up so fast!

02:47:53.161 --> 02:47:57.846
(air horn sounds, laughter)

02:47:57.846 --> 02:48:01.629
MATT: Awesome. Well, I guess then we'll relinquish
you guys to watch your Star Wars.

02:48:01.667 --> 02:48:02.979
TRAVIS: Oh, actually--

02:48:02.979 --> 02:48:11.209
MATT: (frustrated growl) I will smash your mini. I
would never do that. I painted it. Far too long.

02:48:11.209 --> 02:48:14.681
All right, guys. Seriously, happy holidays, happy
new year.

02:48:14.681 --> 02:48:15.949
LAURA: Happy holidays.

02:48:15.949 --> 02:48:18.263
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Happy Winter's Crest.

02:48:18.263 --> 02:48:20.134
MATT: Indeed. Bye guys.

02:48:20.134 --> 02:48:21.403
LIAM: I have a snake!

02:48:21.403 --> 02:48:24.359
TRAVIS: See you on the other side.
