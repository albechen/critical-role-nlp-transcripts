00:00:01.322 --> 00:00:06.578
TALIESIN: Finish it! Finish it, I dare you!

00:00:06.578 --> 00:00:13.358
(cheering)

00:00:13.358 --> 00:00:19.152
TALIESIN: Good evening, everybody. Welcome to
terrible decisions in my life. Welcome to Critical

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:26.345
Role. We are doing Vampire: The Masquerade. Sort
of. Well, we're going to talk about it. We're

00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:31.581
doing kind of a homebrew thing. It's going to be
fun. It's going to be weird. It's going to be dark

00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:36.916
and really inappropriate and I'm so sorry. If any
of you are a little squeamish, it's going to get a

00:00:36.916 --> 00:00:51.319
little weird, and I'm so sorry. I was a big fan of
this game 25 years ago. This game and the World of

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:57.158
Darkness, Werewolf: The Apocalypse, Mage: The
Ascension, Changeling: The Dreaming, and all of

00:00:57.158 --> 00:01:03.365
these games were a big part of all of our lives
and they really affected us and changed us. It was

00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:08.545
an introduction to roleplaying for a lot of
people who may not have been comfortable with

00:01:08.545 --> 00:01:15.145
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons of something obviously much
more serious, because look at us. We're so much

00:01:15.145 --> 00:01:25.596
more serious right now. The build that we're going
to be running is kind of a mix of, as I'm checking

00:01:25.596 --> 00:01:36.830
my notes, the new v5 Alpha. It's also a little bit of
Onyx, it's a bit of my old homebrew that I found

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.211
bits and pieces of while cleaning my room, all
mushed together. If you're interested in this

00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:47.206
game, there's a brand-new version in Alpha right
now that you can play around with. There's also

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:54.894
the old school stuff that Onyx has put out which
is the size of a small library. You can go in and

00:01:54.894 --> 00:02:00.828
find books on every city and every type of
creature you could want. There's weird, angry 80s

00:02:00.828 --> 00:02:09.575
versions of everybody. I want to do a special
thanks to Jason Carl, White Wolf, Onyx Path, and Don

00:02:09.575 --> 00:02:12.710
and Katherine, if you're watching, for running
really good games, and Sasha and Juliet for

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.371
running very good games. Sasha's not watching;
she's at marching band. You've got marching to do.

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:19.558
SAM: This music, Taliesin.

00:02:19.558 --> 00:02:27.729
TALIESIN: This is Syrinscape. I hit a random
button in their Creepy Asylum set. It's rocking.

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:31.983
We have some announcements that, in theory, I was
supposed to have, but I don't. I know some of them

00:02:31.983 --> 00:02:33.342
off the top of my head.

00:02:33.342 --> 00:02:35.581
SAM: I can help you out there, Taliesin.

00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:37.285
TALIESIN: You can start there with Backblaze.

00:02:37.285 --> 00:02:45.824
SAM: Is the camera on me? Our sponsor tonight is
Backblaze! Yev from Backblaze is back again to

00:02:45.824 --> 00:02:53.383
peddle his wares. Backblaze is unlimited backup
for Macs and PCs. You can use mobile apps to

00:02:53.383 --> 00:02:59.892
access data on the go. You can recover files by
mail using a flash key or hard drive. They'll ship

00:02:59.892 --> 00:03:06.484
it to your door to restore your data. And you get
a 15-day, fully-featured free trial if you go to

00:03:06.484 --> 00:03:15.178
backblaze.com/criticalrole. To honor our fine
people at Backblaze, I have composed a rap in the

00:03:15.178 --> 00:03:21.998
style of Sir Mix-A-Lot. Ahem. Oh boy, I should
have rehearsed this.

00:03:21.998 --> 00:03:26.248
TALIESIN: You and me fucking both.

00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:32.101
SAM: I like backups and I cannot lie! Those other
brothers can't deny! When a virus hits and your

00:03:32.101 --> 00:03:36.673
hard drive quits, but you backed up all your shit
you get sprung! Wanna act all tough 'cause you

00:03:36.673 --> 00:03:38.817
know it's all backed up. So fellas!

00:03:38.817 --> 00:03:39.567
TRAVIS and MATT: Yeah!

00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:40.241
SAM: Fellas!

00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:40.989
TRAVIS and MATT: Yeah!

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.057
SAM: Storing lots of porn?

00:03:42.057 --> 00:03:43.606
TRAVIS and MATT: Yeah!

00:03:43.606 --> 00:03:44.542
SAM: You better store it!

00:03:44.542 --> 00:03:45.200
TRAVIS and MATT: Store it!

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.922
SAM: Hoard it!

00:03:45.922 --> 00:03:46.680
TRAVIS and MATT: Hoard it!

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.187
SAM: Store those gigs of smut! Baby got
Backblaze!

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:51.750
(cheering)

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.612
TRAVIS: Yeah! Backblaze rap!

00:03:55.612 --> 00:03:57.562
SAM: Backblaze! Check it out.

00:03:57.562 --> 00:04:00.031
TALIESIN: Wow, it's only uphill from here. That's
good.

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:01.993
LAURA: Very nice, Sam.

00:04:01.993 --> 00:04:03.536
TALIESIN: That was beautiful.

00:04:03.536 --> 00:04:06.274
LIAM: So we're all vampires tonight, right?

00:04:06.274 --> 00:04:07.146
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:08.944
LIAM: Is the camera even picking us up?

00:04:08.944 --> 00:04:10.060
LAURA: I know; can you see us?

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.313
LIAM: Can you see us?

00:04:11.313 --> 00:04:14.149
TRAVIS: Just your jewelry floating around in the
empty space.

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:18.541
TALIESIN: I was about to be nerdy enough to say
that all vampires in the White Wolf universe are

00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:23.323
picked up by electronics. Yeah. There's only one
clan that even is not reflected in the

00:04:23.323 --> 00:04:24.622
mirror.

00:04:24.622 --> 00:04:25.821
LIAM: I was just testing you.

00:04:25.821 --> 00:04:31.132
TALIESIN: I know some of this! I don't know all of
it. I remember some of this from high school. Got

00:04:31.132 --> 00:04:36.091
to be able to LARP this stuff. Do we have anything
new in merch?

00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:44.634
LAURA: Well, it's the same stuff in merch, but we
also have the art book coming out! The one we

00:04:44.634 --> 00:04:45.583
talked about.

00:04:45.583 --> 00:04:47.050
SAM: Oh, the new comic!

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.513
LIAM: Scanlan and Grog.

00:04:48.513 --> 00:04:49.840
SAM: Did you read it?

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.225
TRAVIS: I did.

00:04:51.225 --> 00:04:52.573
SAM: It's good, right?

00:04:52.573 --> 00:04:54.797
TRAVIS: The troublesome twosome. Pretty sweet.

00:04:54.797 --> 00:04:56.155
SAM: Pretty good.

00:04:56.155 --> 00:04:58.858
TALIESIN: Putting it out there for anyone watching
that I don't have the rest of the announcements,

00:04:58.858 --> 00:05:03.178
so if there's anything that anybody wanted me to
say, they should put it on here with a piece of

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:04.951
paper at some point.

00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:06.853
TRAVIS: The comic book is amazing. Beardless
Grog.

00:05:06.923 --> 00:05:08.160
SAM: Oh yeah!

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.153
TRAVIS: He's like a baby! A baby in the woods.

00:05:11.153 --> 00:05:18.388
MARISHA: It's weird looking at your D&amp;amp;D characters
and being like, "Oh! They were so young! They were babies!"

00:05:18.388 --> 00:05:22.427
LAURA: Oh look, they're alive!

00:05:22.427 --> 00:05:26.744
TRAVIS: The writing is fucking brilliant, as
always, Colville is amazing. Olivia Samson.

00:05:26.744 --> 00:05:29.774
SAM: Good action, good art. It's good stuff.

00:05:29.774 --> 00:05:34.844
TALIESIN: We're going to be doing Slave Labor
Graphics on Wednesday Club. It's going to be

00:05:34.844 --> 00:05:40.531
Johnny The Homicidal Maniac and all sorts of gothy
comic books for Halloween. We're going to be doing

00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:46.569
Gather Your Ghost tomorrow because it's funny when
I do a show three days in a row. Four days in a

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:47.760
row here!

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.566
MARISHA: Sagas of Sundry: Madness is coming out
next week! Yeah!

00:05:51.566 --> 00:05:53.991
LAURA: Should have worn the black wig tonight!

00:05:53.991 --> 00:05:56.506
MARISHA: I thought it would be spoilery.

00:05:56.506 --> 00:05:59.345
TALIESIN: You had free time; you could have pulled
that together.

00:05:59.345 --> 00:06:02.430
MARISHA: Yeah, I thought about it. I was like,
"Should I? Eh."

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.713
TALIESIN: Trying to think if there was anything
else off the top of my head. I feel like I'm

00:06:07.713 --> 00:06:09.244
missing something.

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:15.405
MATT: Vamp as much as you want, Taliesin, you have
to start the game soon. (laughter) Look, I don't

00:06:15.405 --> 00:06:17.751
get to enjoy giving you shit from this side of the
table.

00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:24.313
TALIESIN: For the record, this is intimidating!
Holy cow. I feel like I want to adjust my desktop

00:06:24.313 --> 00:06:26.253
settings. This is a lot.

00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:27.579
LAURA: I'm scared of it.

00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:34.054
TALIESIN: You should be. This is evil and
terrible. This is a brand-new game system, so

00:06:34.054 --> 00:06:40.152
we're going to be taking it slow. For those of you
at home who know Vampire: The Masquerade, this is

00:06:40.152 --> 00:06:46.212
going to be a very barebones thing. We've cut a
lot of fat. We've cut a lot of something. We've

00:06:46.212 --> 00:06:52.568
cut a lot of limbs from this baby, but it is going
to be dark. There are going to be hints of what's

00:06:52.568 --> 00:06:58.464
going on in the real world, but we're keeping this
very insulated, so it's not going to be a lot of

00:06:58.464 --> 00:06:59.906
world-building. Ah, thank you!

00:06:59.906 --> 00:07:05.535
TRAVIS: There's also going to be a Talks Machina
next week on Tuesday discussing this one shot.

00:07:05.535 --> 00:07:06.514
SAM: Oh, really?

00:07:06.514 --> 00:07:07.450
TRAVIS: Yes, there will be.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.070
SAM: Is it going to have a different name?

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.717
TALIESIN: No. Don't forget to submit your gif and
fanart of the week to submit@talksmachina.com.

00:07:14.717 --> 00:07:16.849
You're still in Batman, which is great.

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:19.930
MATT: Yeah! Still there; they haven't gotten rid
of me yet.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.216
TALIESIN: I don't know if we're talking about
Thrashtopia yet, but eventually we're talking

00:07:24.216 --> 00:07:25.983
about Thrashtopia because Thrashtopia's cool.

00:07:25.983 --> 00:07:29.425
MARISHA: Yeah. Thrashtopia has been uttered into
the universe.

00:07:29.425 --> 00:07:33.529
TALIESIN: CR podcast is now available through
Amazon Alexa, apparently, which I did not know.

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:37.803
It's available on Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, Echo
Plus, and other Alexa-enabled devices.

00:07:37.803 --> 00:07:40.967
MATT: Maybe you just yell loud into a canyon, it
echoes back to you.

00:07:40.967 --> 00:07:43.325
TALIESIN: Just say, "Alexa, how do you want to do
this?" and it plays.

00:07:43.325 --> 00:07:44.958
LAURA: That would be amazing! Wouldn't it?!

00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:48.389
MARISHA: Could we make that happen? I'm going to
talk to Ben!

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:50.148
TALIESIN: I don't know how things work.

00:07:50.148 --> 00:07:51.786
MARISHA: Ben. Let's make it happen.

00:07:51.786 --> 00:07:54.089
TALIESIN: I think that's what Ben wanted me to
say. Ben.

00:07:54.089 --> 00:07:55.727
LAURA: It's so cool. Make it so.

00:07:55.727 --> 00:08:02.217
TALIESIN: This'll be a d10 system, so everyone
remembers. It's going to be a six and above is a win.

00:08:02.217 --> 00:08:04.234
LAURA: I've got so many d10s in my tray right
now.

00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:07.405
TALIESIN: I'll explain the red dice. We're going
to take this through, and it's going to be really

00:08:07.405 --> 00:08:15.341
weird. I am so sorry for everything that's about
to happen. I'm going to try to maintain my cool.

00:08:15.341 --> 00:08:17.150
MARISHA: Let's do this shit!

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.580
TALIESIN: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
hopefully people who are not too young to be

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:27.386
scarred for life: prepare for Critical Role: Goth
Vampire Edition.

00:08:27.386 --> 00:09:58.378
[dramatic music]

00:09:58.378 --> 00:10:07.599
(laughter)

00:10:07.599 --> 00:10:11.656
MATT: I legitimately can say I understand.

00:10:11.656 --> 00:10:13.666
TALIESIN: It's not going to save you.

00:10:13.666 --> 00:10:14.835
MATT: I know.

00:10:14.835 --> 00:10:27.022
TALIESIN: All right. When we last left off, we
were finishing up a very emotional, very heavy and

00:10:27.022 --> 00:10:29.517
intense episode of Critical Role.

00:10:29.517 --> 00:10:31.284
LAURA: Oh my god. Super meta.

00:10:31.284 --> 00:10:37.217
TALIESIN: We're going meta, people. It was a tough
time; everyone went home. We packed up our stuff.

00:10:37.217 --> 00:10:44.872
Made our way out to our cars in the parking lot.
And that's the last thing you remember before it

00:10:44.872 --> 00:10:59.625
all went black. You have been away for some time.
You don't know how long it's been. You don't know

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:10.038
where you are. You don't feel quite right. You
feel disconnected. Something's a little off.

00:11:10.038 --> 00:11:18.469
You're hungry, you're thirsty, you're not entirely
sure, but you're waking up and it is pitch black.

00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:23.413
LAURA: Is there anyone around us?

00:11:23.413 --> 00:11:31.519
TALIESIN: Can you see anything? Take a look! It's
very dark and there's nothing around. You're lying

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:32.922
on your back.

00:11:32.922 --> 00:11:34.818
LIAM: Each of us alone?

00:11:34.818 --> 00:11:36.135
TALIESIN: Each of you alone.

00:11:36.135 --> 00:11:39.554
LAURA: Put my hand up and feel.

00:11:39.554 --> 00:11:40.924
TALIESIN: Yes, you are in a coffin.

00:11:40.924 --> 00:11:44.162
(yelling)

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:45.446
MARISHA: Oh god!

00:11:45.446 --> 00:11:49.164
SAM: I'm going to start shouting. Hello! Can
anyone hear me?

00:11:49.164 --> 00:11:51.081
TALIESIN: You're a voice actor. You call that
shouting?

00:11:51.081 --> 00:11:56.715
SAM: It's me, Sam Riegel of Critical Role!

00:11:56.715 --> 00:12:03.569
TALIESIN: The sound is deadened by the thick wood
and the fabric.

00:12:03.569 --> 00:12:06.965
LAURA: Can we try to push?

00:12:06.965 --> 00:12:14.814
TALIESIN: Yeah, give me a strength plus melee.

00:12:14.814 --> 00:12:18.291
MATT: I'm going to Uma Thurman.

00:12:18.291 --> 00:12:21.571
MARISHA: That's what I was going to do. I'm trying
to one-inch punch this.

00:12:21.571 --> 00:12:23.831
TRAVIS: Me too.

00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:26.073
LAURA: A ten and a six.

00:12:26.073 --> 00:12:28.272
TALIESIN: A ten and a six, that's two successes.

00:12:28.272 --> 00:12:31.494
LIAM: I got a ten and this X-ed-out one.

00:12:31.554 --> 00:12:32.795
TALIESIN: Oh no.

00:12:32.795 --> 00:12:33.806
LAURA: That's bad.

00:12:33.806 --> 00:12:35.212
LIAM: I figured as much.

00:12:35.212 --> 00:12:36.986
LAURA: You succeeded and you failed.

00:12:36.986 --> 00:12:38.927
MATT: That's okay. I failed as well.

00:12:38.927 --> 00:12:43.743
MARISHA: What do we roll for the one-inch
punch thing?

00:12:43.743 --> 00:12:46.634
SAM: So you got an X-ed-out one as well?

00:12:46.634 --> 00:12:54.245
TALIESIN: Liam, something's wrong. You go up to
touch your face, and it doesn't feel right. It

00:12:54.245 --> 00:13:00.647
feels like papier-mache, there's something weird.
Laura, you rolled how many?

00:13:00.647 --> 00:13:03.400
LAURA: Two successes. That's all I could roll.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.182
TALIESIN: How many did you get?

00:13:05.182 --> 00:13:06.839
MARISHA: What do I roll for one-inch punching?

00:13:06.839 --> 00:13:08.382
TALIESIN: Strength plus melee.

00:13:08.382 --> 00:13:12.450
MARISHA: Do I use the red?

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.443
TALIESIN: You have to always use at least two
of the red.

00:13:14.443 --> 00:13:16.082
MARISHA: Always two, copy that.

00:13:16.082 --> 00:13:17.857
TALIESIN: Whatever red you have, you have to use.

00:13:17.857 --> 00:13:25.159
MARISHA: Okay. I don't know what that means, but
I'm into it. All are successes but two.

00:13:25.159 --> 00:13:27.677
LAURA: Both of the reds are successes.

00:13:27.677 --> 00:13:29.055
MARISHA: Four successes.

00:13:29.055 --> 00:13:37.683
TALIESIN: You give a sharp push and the top of the
coffin cracks a bit. It snaps.

00:13:37.683 --> 00:13:39.350
MARISHA: Shit, I fucking broke it!

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:44.686
MATT: My strength is two, my melee is zero, which
is accurate.

00:13:44.686 --> 00:13:46.277
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

00:13:46.277 --> 00:13:51.947
MATT: I rolled a five and a one. So a failure and
whatever the X means.

00:13:51.947 --> 00:13:54.003
TALIESIN: You're feeling a little queasy.

00:13:54.003 --> 00:13:55.383
MATT: That's about right.

00:13:55.383 --> 00:13:58.802
TALIESIN: You're not feeling good. You got to hold
on.

00:13:58.802 --> 00:14:00.334
SAM: One success.

00:14:00.334 --> 00:14:05.836
TALIESIN: One success? All right. You give it a
push and it moves a little bit. Got a little shove.

00:14:05.836 --> 00:14:07.498
TRAVIS: Three successes.

00:14:07.498 --> 00:14:13.985
TALIESIN: The coffin cover cracks in half. That's
as far as you've gotten.

00:14:13.985 --> 00:14:15.370
LAURA: What did mine do?

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:21.369
TALIESIN: Yours got a good little shove. If there
was something to see outside, you would see

00:14:21.369 --> 00:14:28.053
something, but there's not yet. You start to hear
a little bit of a squeak. You feel something

00:14:28.053 --> 00:14:31.081
wriggling around inside the box with you.

00:14:31.081 --> 00:14:32.800
SAM: Like a mouse squeak?

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.420
TALIESIN: If a mouse were bigger.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.970
MARISHA: Rats?

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:42.265
TALIESIN: That's a good guess. It could be
something rat-ish.

00:14:42.265 --> 00:14:44.260
LAURA: Do I want to eat the rat-ish?

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.458
TALIESIN: I don't know; do you?

00:14:45.458 --> 00:14:46.812
TRAVIS: Do you like radishes?

00:14:46.812 --> 00:14:47.966
LAURA: Maybe.

00:14:47.966 --> 00:14:56.003
TALIESIN: You're definitely feeling hungry, and it
does strangely smell appetizing.

00:14:56.003 --> 00:14:57.876
LAURA: Can I catch it and eat it?

00:14:57.876 --> 00:15:03.600
TALIESIN: Give me a dex roll.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.067
LAURA: Just dex?

00:15:05.067 --> 00:15:09.812
TALIESIN: Give me dex athletics, just to be fun.
See what that does.

00:15:09.812 --> 00:15:11.591
MARISHA: We all have rats in there?

00:15:11.591 --> 00:15:12.660
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:13.961
LAURA: Where's my athletics?

00:15:13.961 --> 00:15:15.330
TALIESIN: Top of physical.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:22.714
LAURA: I don't have athletics. Yes I do. Shut up.

00:15:22.714 --> 00:15:26.340
TALIESIN: These are complicated. It's going to
take a second.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:32.972
LAURA: Oh okay. Success, success, success, and two
failures.

00:15:32.972 --> 00:15:34.345
TALIESIN: Two failures?

00:15:34.345 --> 00:15:35.684
LAURA: But three successes!

00:15:35.684 --> 00:15:36.992
TALIESIN: Are the two failures on red dice?

00:15:36.992 --> 00:15:39.798
LAURA: No, one is on a red, and one is a success
on a red.

00:15:39.798 --> 00:15:50.143
TALIESIN: Okay. You grab the rat and it bites you.
But you're holding on. You're still not feeling

00:15:50.143 --> 00:15:51.768
very well, you can't react yet.

00:15:51.768 --> 00:15:56.980
LIAM: Is there enough room to bring my knees up
and start pushing with feet and hands?

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.755
TALIESIN: Not yet, but soon. You're still a little
weirded out by your face.

00:16:00.755 --> 00:16:02.833
MARISHA: I'm up, right?

00:16:02.833 --> 00:16:04.604
TALIESIN: You're still in your coffin.

00:16:04.604 --> 00:16:09.309
TRAVIS: Can I reach my fingers through the crack
in the top of the coffin and see if there's any

00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:11.660
light, cold, or anything?

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:16.365
TALIESIN: You feel wood, I suppose. There's
another layer of wood above you.

00:16:16.365 --> 00:16:18.382
LAURA: What?

00:16:18.382 --> 00:16:20.820
TRAVIS: No light?

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.891
TALIESIN: No light. Not yet.

00:16:22.891 --> 00:16:31.655
SAM: I'm yelling: I am an internet celebrity!
People know me! Not many people. In obscure

00:16:31.655 --> 00:16:34.442
corners, but mostly in gaming stores.

00:16:34.442 --> 00:16:38.714
MARISHA: Situationally famous.

00:16:38.714 --> 00:16:41.706
TALIESIN: Do you want to do something with that
rat?

00:16:41.706 --> 00:16:44.046
LAURA: Yeah! I want to bite it like I just ate
that donut!

00:16:44.046 --> 00:16:45.269
TRAVIS: Gross.

00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:51.258
TALIESIN: Take a big bite of that rat. All right,
so give me one of your red dice.

00:16:51.258 --> 00:16:52.971
LAURA: Oh no!

00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:53.900
TALIESIN: No, that's good.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.620
LAURA: Okay.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.311
TALIESIN: Mark your hunger, if you have a pencil,
to just one X.

00:16:59.311 --> 00:17:01.987
LAURA: It's on the very bottom.

00:17:01.987 --> 00:17:03.457
TALIESIN: Just one.

00:17:03.457 --> 00:17:08.678
LIAM: Who's that at the window? Hunger! Ooh,
hunger!

00:17:08.678 --> 00:17:14.963
TALIESIN: I love that show. You're feeling a
little better. You're feeling a little more

00:17:14.963 --> 00:17:20.056
clear-headed. This is not a good situation.

00:17:20.056 --> 00:17:22.673
LAURA: Did I just eat a rat?

00:17:22.673 --> 00:17:25.745
TALIESIN: You did just eat a rat. I'm going to
point out: it's not that you're not hungry any

00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:29.052
more. You're still hungry; you're just feeling a
little better.

00:17:29.052 --> 00:17:33.424
LIAM: Am I so distracted with my face--

00:17:33.424 --> 00:17:35.277
TALIESIN: No, you're good now.

00:17:35.277 --> 00:17:37.486
LIAM: Okay, all fours, pushing.

00:17:37.486 --> 00:17:45.468
TALIESIN: Give a good push. Give me either, yeah,
fun, strength brawl or strength athletics to see

00:17:45.468 --> 00:17:47.463
if you can push it off.

00:17:47.463 --> 00:17:55.445
LIAM: (grunting) I don't like it in here! The red
is a ten and a two. And then a nine and one on the

00:17:55.445 --> 00:17:58.456
other dice. So success, success, failure,
failure.

00:17:58.456 --> 00:18:10.684
TALIESIN: You got the coffin lid about halfway off
now. You can almost make out a layer of wood above you.

00:18:10.684 --> 00:18:16.414
MARISHA: I'm going to give another whack where
I've already indented it. Same roll?

00:18:16.414 --> 00:18:21.797
TALIESIN: Yeah, strength brawl or strength melee.
I'll give you options now.

00:18:21.797 --> 00:18:23.908
LAURA: You have a better melee than brawl?

00:18:23.908 --> 00:18:30.471
MARISHA: Yeah, it doesn't make a lot of sense. I
don't quite understand it. Okay. Three successes

00:18:30.471 --> 00:18:32.767
and three failures, two failures on the red.

00:18:32.767 --> 00:18:34.223
TALIESIN: Two failures on the red?

00:18:34.223 --> 00:18:35.535
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:18:35.535 --> 00:18:39.999
TALIESIN: Ooh, that's interesting. I'm learning
how this works, one second.

00:18:39.999 --> 00:18:47.487
TRAVIS: I like this! She eats her hand.

00:18:47.487 --> 00:18:51.338
LAURA: Oh my god, what if she does?! What if she
eats her own flesh?!

00:18:51.338 --> 00:18:54.369
TALIESIN: Things can happen, man, I'm not going to
say.

00:18:54.369 --> 00:18:55.862
MARISHA: Bucket list check?

00:18:55.862 --> 00:19:00.782
LAURA: Make sure it's a digit you don't use very
much.

00:19:00.782 --> 00:19:03.405
MARISHA: Start with the pinkies and work your way
back?

00:19:03.405 --> 00:19:05.737
MATT: How will you pinky swear?

00:19:05.737 --> 00:19:08.667
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry, I'm trying to find my one
hunger.

00:19:08.667 --> 00:19:10.658
LIAM: You don't pinky swear with evil people.

00:19:10.658 --> 00:19:16.239
LAURA: Evil people don't pinky swear! Evil people
middle finger swear!

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:18.499
MARISHA: Middle finger swear, yeah!

00:19:18.499 --> 00:19:22.780
LIAM, LAURA, and MARISHA: Middle finger!

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:34.797
TALIESIN: Yeah, you don't feel well at all. You
start scratching at your wrists. You start digging

00:19:34.797 --> 00:19:38.590
in a little bit. You're going to take one damage
and you're going to start sucking your own blood

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.371
because things are getting weird.

00:19:40.371 --> 00:19:41.517
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

00:19:41.517 --> 00:19:43.073
MARISHA: So dehydrated, you guys!

00:19:43.073 --> 00:19:45.234
TRAVIS: So much crying since last week!

00:19:45.234 --> 00:19:51.742
TALIESIN: You're going to take one damage and
sadly, you're getting a little weird.

00:19:51.742 --> 00:19:56.840
LAURA: You get another red die! I don't even know
what it means!

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.828
LIAM: She has to roll three of them.

00:19:58.828 --> 00:20:00.528
LAURA: It's all so mysterious!

00:20:00.528 --> 00:20:08.948
MATT: I notice the rat's there and I look at my
broken hand. So instead, I decide I'm going to try

00:20:08.948 --> 00:20:12.103
to coax it near me. Hey! Hey little guy! Hey
buddy!

00:20:12.103 --> 00:20:15.534
TALIESIN: I'm going to give charisma animal ken.

00:20:15.534 --> 00:20:21.881
LAURA: That's good! I guess we have to lean into
our strengths.

00:20:21.881 --> 00:20:23.639
TALIESIN: That's a good idea.

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:25.982
TRAVIS: Oh no.

00:20:25.982 --> 00:20:28.929
MATT: Six or above you said? That's three
successes.

00:20:28.929 --> 00:20:35.069
TALIESIN: It thinks that you are the nicest,
sweetest, most wonderful person and is so excited

00:20:35.069 --> 00:20:40.780
that it may get to play with you and be a part of
the game. It comes over and it's really--

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.138
MATT: How hungry am I?

00:20:42.138 --> 00:20:45.300
TALIESIN: You're two dice worth of hungry right
now, man, that's pretty hungry.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.385
MATT: How cute is the rat?

00:20:46.385 --> 00:20:50.576
TALIESIN: It's not that cute. A pescatarian would
probably eat it.

00:20:50.576 --> 00:20:52.175
MATT: I'll eat the rat.

00:20:52.175 --> 00:20:56.634
TALIESIN: All right, good for you! Your hunger's at
one. Give me one of your die.

00:20:56.634 --> 00:21:01.985
MATT: Whee! It actually hit the rat!

00:21:01.985 --> 00:21:03.649
TALIESIN: You actually just knocked--

00:21:03.649 --> 00:21:04.989
MARISHA: Oh, buddy!

00:21:04.989 --> 00:21:09.443
TALIESIN: Poor guy. It's okay. He's going to
sleep. I'll get him his coffin later.

00:21:09.443 --> 00:21:13.062
LIAM: You can't see his penis any more!

00:21:13.062 --> 00:21:16.983
SAM: I'll roll to try to headbutt my way out of
here. Three successes!

00:21:16.983 --> 00:21:21.138
TALIESIN: You snap that in half, and now you've
just got wood.

00:21:21.138 --> 00:21:26.928
TRAVIS: I'm going to try and reach using my
superior strength and try and punch through that

00:21:26.928 --> 00:21:30.164
crack into the wood above.

00:21:30.164 --> 00:21:31.591
SAM: Superior strength?

00:21:31.591 --> 00:21:34.026
LAURA: How many strengths does he have?

00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:35.500
SAM: More than all of us.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.747
TRAVIS: That's three successes and one failure
with the red.

00:21:38.747 --> 00:21:46.540
TALIESIN: One failure with the red? You crack
through, but some of the wood splinters and gets

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:52.499
lodged and you're going to spend a minute trying
to pull some chunks of wood out of your fist. That

00:21:52.499 --> 00:21:54.134
was a good shot, though.

00:21:54.134 --> 00:22:01.507
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and eat a rat, too.
Pop him off, Ozzy Osbourne-style.

00:22:01.507 --> 00:22:03.237
TALIESIN: You've got to catch the rat.

00:22:03.237 --> 00:22:05.816
MARISHA: I catch the rat and I eat it.

00:22:05.816 --> 00:22:07.637
TALIESIN: How are you going to catch the rat?

00:22:07.637 --> 00:22:09.095
MARISHA: How am I going to catch it?

00:22:09.095 --> 00:22:11.918
TALIESIN: How are you going to catch it? Gotta
catch 'em all!

00:22:11.918 --> 00:22:18.323
MARISHA: Do rats like-- hmm. What do rats like?

00:22:18.323 --> 00:22:21.923
TALIESIN: They like Disney films. Cheese. Amazon
gift cards.

00:22:21.923 --> 00:22:23.982
LAURA: I don't think they really like cheese very
much.

00:22:23.982 --> 00:22:26.331
MARISHA: I'm going to do little rat scratches on
the--

00:22:26.331 --> 00:22:37.075
TALIESIN: You're going to do Pirates of the
Caribbean? Let's give you manipulation animal ken.

00:22:37.075 --> 00:22:39.149
MARISHA: I can manipulate animal ken!

00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:42.188
LAURA: We're just so hungry.

00:22:42.188 --> 00:22:51.077
MARISHA: Come here, you little fucker. Three
successes, two failures. One failure on red.

00:22:51.077 --> 00:22:56.902
TALIESIN: One failure on red? You grab it. You
take a bite. You're going to lose one of those red

00:22:56.902 --> 00:23:02.006
die, but you are going to feel a little nauseous
about this whole process.

00:23:02.006 --> 00:23:04.142
MARISHA: Well, I'm in a coffin.

00:23:04.142 --> 00:23:12.500
TALIESIN: You are in a coffin. I'm amused by the
throwing of the dice. All right.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.339
TRAVIS: (groans)

00:23:16.339 --> 00:23:18.178
TALIESIN: Yeah, you got a second.

00:23:18.178 --> 00:23:20.940
MATT: I listen out to see if I hear anything.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.376
TALIESIN: You hear someone claiming to be an
internet celebrity.

00:23:23.376 --> 00:23:29.934
MATT: I start going: Sam! Sam, it's me! It's
Matt!

00:23:29.934 --> 00:23:31.783
SAM: Matt, is that you?

00:23:31.783 --> 00:23:32.998
MATT: It's me!

00:23:32.998 --> 00:23:41.469
SAM: What has happened to us?! All I see is wood!
Have we gone inside Wyrmwood?

00:23:41.469 --> 00:23:46.849
TALIESIN: I feel like I should be able to bleed
you for that.

00:23:46.849 --> 00:23:52.516
LAURA: Is there any kind of lock? I have it open a
crack; I can't feel any?

00:23:52.516 --> 00:23:54.354
TALIESIN: There's no lock, no. It was just
sealed.

00:23:54.354 --> 00:23:56.355
LAURA: I want to shove it over to the side.

00:23:56.355 --> 00:24:02.321
LIAM: I'd like to rap a song with my knuckles on
the wood to try to get somebody's attention.

00:24:02.321 --> 00:24:05.107
TALIESIN: You're starting to hear that you're
obviously in a small group together.

00:24:05.107 --> 00:24:07.779
MARISAH: We can also sort of hear?

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:09.055
MATT: Sam!

00:24:09.055 --> 00:24:10.094
SAM: Matt!

00:24:10.094 --> 00:24:11.035
LAURA: Sam?

00:24:11.035 --> 00:24:11.921
MARISHA: Sam!

00:24:11.921 --> 00:24:12.878
LAURA: Matt?

00:24:12.878 --> 00:24:14.260
SAM: Marisha?

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.494
LAURA: Dad?

00:24:15.494 --> 00:24:19.654
TALIESIN: Rocky! You've managed to make your way
out.

00:24:19.654 --> 00:24:21.120
TRAVIS: I made it out first?

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.358
TALIESIN: You can crawl out.

00:24:22.358 --> 00:24:24.748
TRAVIS: Do I see anything?

00:24:24.748 --> 00:24:25.983
LAURA: Do you see my fingers?

00:24:25.983 --> 00:24:33.462
TALIESIN: You take a look and you're on a set.

00:24:33.462 --> 00:24:36.340
MARISHA: Okay! Max!

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:43.936
TRAVIS: (shushing) Guys! I'm outside the boxes!

00:24:43.936 --> 00:24:46.652
LAURA: Baby! Do you see my fingers?

00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:54.173
TALIESIN: You don't see their fingers, but you do
see you're on a set. It looks pretty familiar. It

00:24:54.173 --> 00:24:56.202
might be the Nerdist set.

00:24:56.202 --> 00:24:57.784
TRAVIS: The fuck?

00:24:57.784 --> 00:25:00.140
LAURA: Did Nerdist turn us into vampires?

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.142
TALIESIN: Hasn't it turned us all into vampires?

00:25:02.142 --> 00:25:03.461
LIAM: Fucking Chobot.

00:25:03.461 --> 00:25:12.604
TALIESIN: We'll get to that. The little light wall
is sparking and flickering. This place is even

00:25:12.604 --> 00:25:18.131
more trashed than normal. Someone went through
here. There's already a giant hole in the floor

00:25:18.131 --> 00:25:24.917
that's been blown through, and there are red X's
in a circle and you've come out of one of them.

00:25:24.917 --> 00:25:31.680
You can see some of the wood has started to give a
little bit and you can hear the tapping coming

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.248
from the ground.

00:25:33.248 --> 00:25:34.856
TRAVIS: Sam! Quit yelling like a little bitch!

00:25:34.856 --> 00:25:38.135
LAURA: Travis! I start pounding on the wood.
Travis!

00:25:38.181 --> 00:25:40.484
TRAVIS: Can I find my way to-- Is that Liam?

00:25:40.484 --> 00:25:41.812
LIAM: Yeah!

00:25:41.812 --> 00:25:45.147
TRAVIS: Okay, sit tight. Can I find my way to
Laura's sound?

00:25:45.147 --> 00:25:46.356
LAURA: Baby!

00:25:46.356 --> 00:25:47.250
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:48.659
LAURA: Baby! Help!

00:25:48.659 --> 00:25:49.769
SAM: Oh yeah, you're married.

00:25:49.769 --> 00:25:54.900
TRAVIS: You guys are fucked. Can I try and smash
through the floor?

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.265
TALIESIN: Sure, give me a strength brawl.

00:25:58.265 --> 00:26:03.142
TRAVIS: Strength brawl? You are so kind! Give me
one more of these things.

00:26:03.142 --> 00:26:04.424
SAM: Wow!

00:26:04.424 --> 00:26:06.989
TRAVIS: Damn.

00:26:06.989 --> 00:26:09.392
LAURA: There better be a lot of successes in
there.

00:26:09.392 --> 00:26:15.010
TRAVIS: There are. There are five successes and
two failures. None on red.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:22.611
TALIESIN: All right. Yeah. Practically like Bruce
Lee, you punch down and the floor splinters open

00:26:22.611 --> 00:26:28.704
and there's Laura Bailey with blood all over her
face.

00:26:28.704 --> 00:26:29.797
LAURA: Oh!

00:26:29.797 --> 00:26:32.061
TRAVIS: Oh! Shit!

00:26:32.061 --> 00:26:33.642
LAURA: I ate a rat, baby!

00:26:33.642 --> 00:26:35.202
TRAVIS: You did what?!

00:26:35.202 --> 00:26:36.404
LAURA: I ate a rat!

00:26:36.404 --> 00:26:37.484
TRAVIS: You ate a rat?

00:26:37.484 --> 00:26:38.257
LAURA: Yeah!

00:26:38.257 --> 00:26:40.017
TRAVIS: It wasn't because I punched through
the floor?

00:26:40.017 --> 00:26:40.746
LAURA: No!

00:26:40.746 --> 00:26:43.588
TRAVIS: You could have lied and I wouldn't have
known that! Ugh, god!

00:26:43.588 --> 00:26:46.349
LAURA: I was really hungry! I'm sorry.

00:26:46.349 --> 00:26:48.662
TRAVIS: Is there any left?

00:26:48.662 --> 00:26:52.220
LAURA: Well, there's a little bit of rat left, but
it's just the butt.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:56.221
TALIESIN: It's rat butt, man. Even a vampire has
some standards.

00:26:56.221 --> 00:27:00.210
LIAM: Can somebody get me out of wherever the fuck
it is I am?

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:04.394
TRAVIS: Quick note: we could get out of here and
leave everybody else.

00:27:04.394 --> 00:27:05.650
LAURA: We can't do that!

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:06.949
LIAM: I can hear you, dick!

00:27:06.949 --> 00:27:08.661
TALIESIN: You're making a lot of assumptions.

00:27:08.661 --> 00:27:11.101
TRAVIS: Let's get everyone else out.

00:27:11.101 --> 00:27:13.964
MARISHA: Now we all know how you feel about us.

00:27:13.964 --> 00:27:15.405
MATT: Sam!

00:27:15.405 --> 00:27:16.494
SAM: Matt!

00:27:16.494 --> 00:27:19.335
MATT: I'm here, Sam!

00:27:19.335 --> 00:27:20.974
SAM: I can hear you!

00:27:20.974 --> 00:27:23.117
TRAVIS: I'll go get Liam and Sam, you get Matt and
Marisha.

00:27:23.117 --> 00:27:25.238
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try to open Matt and
Marisha.

00:27:25.238 --> 00:27:30.882
TALIESIN: Give me either strength brawl or
strength melee.

00:27:30.882 --> 00:27:35.409
MATT: You can do this, Laura!

00:27:35.409 --> 00:27:36.974
LAURA: Thanks! I'll try!

00:27:36.974 --> 00:27:41.530
MARISHA: Let me know if you need help pushing!

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:43.484
LIAM: There's a rat in here with me.

00:27:43.484 --> 00:27:44.931
MARISHA: You should eat it!

00:27:44.931 --> 00:27:49.584
LAURA: Three successes, two failures. The success
was on the red.

00:27:49.584 --> 00:27:54.363
TALIESIN: As long as there's no failure on the red,
it doesn't matter. You punch through quite easily.

00:27:54.363 --> 00:27:55.401
It goes all right.

00:27:55.401 --> 00:27:56.993
LAURA: Yeah! I'm getting her out first!

00:27:56.993 --> 00:27:58.730
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah!

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:00.178
LAURA: Help me get Matt out.

00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:01.081
MARISHA: Okay!

00:28:01.081 --> 00:28:01.959
LAURA: Matt!

00:28:01.959 --> 00:28:02.860
MATT: Sam!

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:03.985
SAM: Matt!

00:28:03.985 --> 00:28:06.484
MARISHA: I'm confused. Oh yeah, they're yelling
for each other.

00:28:06.484 --> 00:28:09.490
LAURA: Look at all your lipstick on your--

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.862
MARISHA: I know! This is why you don't do this on
a daily basis.

00:28:12.862 --> 00:28:17.257
TRAVIS: On your X I rolled five successes and two
failures, but none on the red.

00:28:17.257 --> 00:28:24.044
TALIESIN: Yep, that does it. It doesn't go well,
but you get it open.

00:28:24.044 --> 00:28:25.767
LIAM: Ooh!

00:28:25.767 --> 00:28:27.787
TRAVIS: You okay?

00:28:27.787 --> 00:28:29.488
TALIESIN: Actually, five/two, that's fine.

00:28:29.488 --> 00:28:30.570
TRAVIS: You all right?

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:31.631
LIAM: Is my face okay?

00:28:31.631 --> 00:28:32.703
TRAVIS: It looks a little fucked up.

00:28:32.703 --> 00:28:33.789
LIAM: It feels weird.

00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:35.212
TRAVIS: We could leave right now.

00:28:35.212 --> 00:28:43.870
TALIESIN: Liam does not look healthy. He looks
almost like everything froze and cracked, like he

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:47.266
was wearing a plaster mask that started to go.

00:28:47.266 --> 00:28:48.500
LAURA: What the fuck happened to you?!

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.487
LIAM: What do you mean?

00:28:49.487 --> 00:28:51.150
LAURA: You look really weird.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:52.801
LIAM: That makes me sad!

00:28:52.801 --> 00:28:56.125
TRAVIS: Don't worry about it. You know what? It's
the lighting in here; it's super low. Let's get

00:28:56.125 --> 00:28:57.841
everybody else out first.

00:28:57.841 --> 00:28:59.122
LAURA: You should eat a rat.

00:28:59.122 --> 00:29:00.738
LIAM: The fuck are you talking about?!

00:29:00.738 --> 00:29:01.760
LAURA: I'm just saying.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:02.784
MARISHA: It's real good.

00:29:02.784 --> 00:29:04.887
LAURA: Can we try to pry open Matt's coffin?

00:29:04.887 --> 00:29:05.958
SAM: Matt?

00:29:05.958 --> 00:29:07.494
MATT: Sam, is that you?

00:29:07.494 --> 00:29:09.336
TALIESIN: I would recommend leaving Sam, but
yeah.

00:29:09.336 --> 00:29:13.487
MARISHA: Okay, we double-team it.

00:29:13.487 --> 00:29:16.054
TALIESIN: You can roll together and we can add
all of your successes together.

00:29:16.054 --> 00:29:17.779
MARISHA: Let's do that.

00:29:17.829 --> 00:29:20.500
TALIESIN: There's also a thing, I'm going to
remind you, you can do if you really don't like

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.859
your roll, although I would save this for later,
you can spend a willpower and reroll all the dice

00:29:23.859 --> 00:29:27.472
you don't like. But then your willpower goes
down.

00:29:27.472 --> 00:29:29.894
MARISHA: Ooh, I got a ten! Ooh, I got two tens!

00:29:29.894 --> 00:29:37.960
TALIESIN: Two tens. You hop over to Matt's
little X. Oh, failures?

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:42.260
MARISHA: One's an X-ed-out X. One on the red.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:48.741
TALIESIN: So you walk over to Matt's little X and
you kick down real hard and you go straight

00:29:48.741 --> 00:29:52.854
through all the way down to the bottom. He's
fine!

00:29:52.854 --> 00:29:56.105
MATT: I spit bits of rat right up into your face.

00:29:56.105 --> 00:30:01.285
LAURA: I definitely also rolled a bunch of
failures with only one success and a failure was

00:30:01.285 --> 00:30:02.573
on the red.

00:30:02.573 --> 00:30:03.861
TALIESIN: Was it a &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; failure?

00:30:03.861 --> 00:30:04.826
LAURA: It's a four.

00:30:04.826 --> 00:30:06.287
TALIESIN: As long as it's not a one, it doesn't
matter.

00:30:06.287 --> 00:30:07.252
LAURA: Okay.

00:30:07.252 --> 00:30:08.981
SAM: A failure is a one.

00:30:08.981 --> 00:30:10.807
TALIESIN: A failure is a one on a &lt;i&gt;red die.&lt;/i&gt;

00:30:10.807 --> 00:30:12.032
LIAM: And a success is--?

00:30:12.032 --> 00:30:13.383
TALIESIN: Six and above.

00:30:13.383 --> 00:30:16.431
LAURA: But a &lt;i&gt;failure&lt;/i&gt; failure is a one.

00:30:16.431 --> 00:30:18.464
TALIESIN: Yeah, you don't have to worry about
anything other than--

00:30:18.464 --> 00:30:20.843
MARISHA: I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

00:30:20.843 --> 00:30:22.589
MATT: It's okay! Where's Sam?

00:30:22.589 --> 00:30:25.285
MARISHA: You look all right, though! I mean, you
look--

00:30:25.285 --> 00:30:26.719
TALIESIN: He looks all right.

00:30:26.719 --> 00:30:29.575
MARISHA: You look as bad as we do, but okay.

00:30:29.575 --> 00:30:31.903
MATT: Thank you for having Sam send you.

00:30:31.903 --> 00:30:35.230
TALIESIN: You guys look like maybe you've been
clubbing. You're a little pale.

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:36.595
TRAVIS: Sam?

00:30:36.595 --> 00:30:37.962
SAM: (shouting) Yeah?

00:30:37.962 --> 00:30:39.863
TRAVIS: Scream like a baby some more.

00:30:39.863 --> 00:30:41.283
SAM: (wailing)

00:30:41.283 --> 00:30:43.209
TRAVIS: Okay, cool. Can we find our way over to
the baby screams?

00:30:43.266 --> 00:30:47.526
TALIESIN: Yeah. Was going to say, yeah, pick which
baby, but yeah, no, that'll work.

00:30:47.526 --> 00:30:51.345
TRAVIS: Liam, you want to help me?

00:30:51.345 --> 00:30:53.311
LIAM: Yeah, of course. Sam, are you okay in
there?

00:30:53.311 --> 00:31:04.707
SAM: (shouting) I'm worried about my nanny! When I
was playing, I had a nanny watching the kids, I've

00:31:04.707 --> 00:31:06.839
got to get home to the kids!

00:31:06.839 --> 00:31:08.062
TRAVIS: Is anybody wearing a watch?

00:31:08.062 --> 00:31:09.811
LAURA: Oh no, Charlie!

00:31:09.811 --> 00:31:11.490
LIAM: Do we have our iPhones on us?

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.618
TALIESIN: You do not have your phones on you.

00:31:13.618 --> 00:31:18.374
LIAM: I'm sure it's just a couple hours later.
We'll get you out of there and we'll figure it out.

00:31:18.374 --> 00:31:21.301
MARISHA: Can I go to the nearest surface and see
if there's a dust layer?

00:31:21.301 --> 00:31:24.959
TALIESIN: You want to actually take a look around,
maybe?

00:31:24.959 --> 00:31:26.210
MARISHA: I want to take a look around.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:27.307
TRAVIS: Let's get Sam out first.

00:31:27.307 --> 00:31:29.394
MARISHA: While they get Sam out, I'm going to look
around.

00:31:29.394 --> 00:31:31.287
TALIESIN: Why don't you do a perception awareness
roll?

00:31:31.287 --> 00:31:35.504
TRAVIS: Strength and brawl is what he told me last
time.

00:31:35.504 --> 00:31:37.045
LIAM: And brawl? Here comes my two big dice.

00:31:37.045 --> 00:31:42.966
TRAVIS: I have one red fail, and one, two, three,
four successes.

00:31:42.966 --> 00:31:46.718
MARISHA: I've got a ten and a seven on the red
ones.

00:31:46.718 --> 00:31:55.160
TALIESIN: Man, you heard another rat rolling
around, and you're eyeing it.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.461
TRAVIS: In the coffin? Or just on the floor?

00:31:57.461 --> 00:31:59.054
TALIESIN: Not everyone has eaten a rat yet.

00:31:59.054 --> 00:32:00.037
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:32:00.037 --> 00:32:02.348
TALIESIN: I think there's one more rat around, you
should go looking for that.

00:32:02.348 --> 00:32:04.199
TRAVIS: I'm going to go look for the sound of that
rat.

00:32:04.199 --> 00:32:05.514
LIAM: What are you doing?

00:32:05.514 --> 00:32:07.500
TRAVIS: I feel like I need a rat.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:11.031
MARISHA: They're kind of refreshing. Don't judge, man.

00:32:11.031 --> 00:32:14.015
LIAM: I'm judging you hard. Real hard.

00:32:14.015 --> 00:32:15.805
MARISHA: We are in a survival situation!

00:32:15.805 --> 00:32:20.210
LIAM: What? We're in the studio! I mean, it's a
little fucked up, but I rolled a ten and a seven,

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:21.577
did we get Sam out?

00:32:21.577 --> 00:32:23.757
TALIESIN: A ten and a seven? Yeah, that'll do it.

00:32:23.757 --> 00:32:26.312
MARISHA: You know there's not good crafty!

00:32:26.312 --> 00:32:28.686
LIAM: Sam! Husband, are you okay?

00:32:28.686 --> 00:32:34.689
SAM: I'm fine! Hey, that was a tough night, but
I'm sorry, are you okay?

00:32:34.689 --> 00:32:37.418
LIAM: It's a process.

00:32:37.418 --> 00:32:38.820
SAM: Okay.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:44.698
LAURA: Oh, I'm sorry I told you that you look like
shit right after everything happened. I didn't

00:32:44.698 --> 00:32:45.749
think about it.

00:32:45.749 --> 00:32:47.178
LIAM: I'm used to that.

00:32:47.178 --> 00:32:50.016
TALIESIN: This is the most WB Vampire since the WB
Vampires.

00:32:50.016 --> 00:32:53.287
MATT: Yeah. Two successes to look around.

00:32:53.287 --> 00:33:06.254
TALIESIN: So there's no one here. And it's kind of
messed up. Oh, plus three. Something is wrong.

00:33:06.254 --> 00:33:12.673
Including a giant sign on the wall painted in
blood that says "Something is wrong."

00:33:12.673 --> 00:33:15.137
TRAVIS: Amazing.

00:33:15.137 --> 00:33:17.767
LAURA: Does it look like familiar handwriting?

00:33:17.767 --> 00:33:27.859
TALIESIN: No. To be fair, with the size of the
palette, it looks a little bit like

00:33:27.859 --> 00:33:29.253
fingerpainting.

00:33:29.253 --> 00:33:33.749
MARISHA: Does it look like it was deliberate, or
like it was part of the Thrashtopia set?

00:33:33.749 --> 00:33:38.626
TALIESIN: It's way too good-looking to be part of
the Thrashtopia set.

00:33:38.626 --> 00:33:40.114
MATT: So it's in Papyrus.

00:33:40.114 --> 00:33:47.533
MARISHA: You guys, someone took their time to tell
us that something is wrong.

00:33:47.533 --> 00:33:51.516
SAM: Of course something is wrong! Look at us! Do
we have fangs?

00:33:51.516 --> 00:33:52.882
TALIESIN: How would you know?

00:33:52.882 --> 00:33:54.545
SAM: I'm looking at them.

00:33:54.545 --> 00:34:00.209
TALIESIN: It's a little dark, Liam does not look
okay.

00:34:00.209 --> 00:34:01.845
MATT: I'm going to look for the lights.

00:34:01.845 --> 00:34:05.336
MARISHA: I'm going to go over to the green lights
and see if I can screw them in.

00:34:05.336 --> 00:34:11.114
TALIESIN: A bunch of them are broken. And it
looks like they've been smashed, all of the

00:34:11.114 --> 00:34:15.962
furniture, the table and the two chairs in that
section have been completely thrashed up and

00:34:15.962 --> 00:34:23.424
broken up. There's damage everywhere. It looks
like a riot came through here.

00:34:23.424 --> 00:34:28.040
LIAM: I'm going to drag my hand through the
writing on the wall, to make sure that it's fake

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.404
blood like syrup.

00:34:29.404 --> 00:34:32.495
TRAVIS: Like, maple syrup and chocolate syrup?

00:34:32.495 --> 00:34:34.377
LIAM: That's right, it's food, right?

00:34:34.377 --> 00:34:36.049
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's maple syrup.

00:34:36.049 --> 00:34:37.367
LIAM: Does it taste like maple syrup?

00:34:37.367 --> 00:34:40.386
TALIESIN: It doesn't quite taste like maple syrup.
How much do you taste?

00:34:40.386 --> 00:34:43.755
LIAM: (lip smacking) Just my fingers, three
fingers.

00:34:43.755 --> 00:34:46.259
LAURA: Stop sticking your fingers in your mouth!

00:34:46.259 --> 00:34:52.550
TALIESIN: Try again? Give me one of your blood
tokens. It's not maple syrup, but it tastes better

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:58.088
than anything that you've ever experienced in your
entire life, you feel great.

00:34:58.088 --> 00:35:00.685
LIAM: Oh, I wipe a letter off the wall, and finish
that off then.

00:35:00.685 --> 00:35:01.907
TALIESIN: Just one. That's all you're getting.

00:35:01.907 --> 00:35:02.949
LIAM: Yeah, that's fine, that's fine.

00:35:02.949 --> 00:35:04.445
TRAVIS: What are you doing? Oh, sorry.

00:35:04.445 --> 00:35:07.865
TALIESIN: But you're hungry, you're all hungry.

00:35:07.865 --> 00:35:12.316
MATT: I'm going to slowly push open the door that
leads to the hallway just outside of the set.

00:35:12.316 --> 00:35:22.314
TALIESIN: So are you going to push towards the
Twitch studio, or push towards the hallway?

00:35:22.314 --> 00:35:24.765
MATT: Oh, sorry, closer to the Twitch studio.

00:35:24.765 --> 00:35:26.986
TALIESIN: Towards the Twitch studio.

00:35:26.986 --> 00:35:28.901
MARISHA: The big body doors? The big stage doors?

00:35:28.901 --> 00:35:36.271
TALIESIN: You sadly can't quite get to it because
there are piles of film memorabilia, there's a

00:35:36.271 --> 00:35:40.043
Power Ranger helmet, there's a Foosball table, it
is just--

00:35:40.043 --> 00:35:42.192
MARISHA: Grab that fucking helmet, it is worth
some money.

00:35:42.192 --> 00:35:43.758
TALIESIN: Not in the condition it's in!

00:35:43.758 --> 00:35:45.756
MATT: Based on her recommendation, I grab the
helmet and put it on.

00:35:45.756 --> 00:35:54.303
MARISHA: Can I bend down and see if there's any of
our stunt swords, or can I snap off a chair leg

00:35:54.303 --> 00:35:55.748
and arm myself?

00:35:55.748 --> 00:36:02.806
TALIESIN: You can snap off a chair leg, that's
okay, give me a strength athletics, I suppose. I'm

00:36:02.806 --> 00:36:04.138
still getting used to--

00:36:04.138 --> 00:36:05.544
TRAVIS: Can I keep looking for that rat?

00:36:05.544 --> 00:36:11.271
TALIESIN: Yeah, give me a perception awareness.
Oh, well, a perception investigation.

00:36:11.271 --> 00:36:12.592
TRAVIS: Damn it.

00:36:12.592 --> 00:36:13.633
MARISHA: Two successes?

00:36:13.633 --> 00:36:15.963
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, it snaps right off, you've got
a broken chair leg.

00:36:15.963 --> 00:36:21.586
SAM: Seeing Marisha do that, I'm going to find any
XLR cable on the floor I can find.

00:36:21.586 --> 00:36:24.107
TALIESIN: You don't even have to roll for 
that, it's everywhere.

00:36:24.107 --> 00:36:26.538
SAM: I'm going to use it as a whip if I need to.

00:36:26.538 --> 00:36:28.031
TALIESIN: That'll work great.

00:36:28.031 --> 00:36:29.885
TRAVIS: Three of three, including one crit.

00:36:29.885 --> 00:36:50.329
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, three and three including one crit?
Boy, do you find that rat. Suddenly--

00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:54.140
LAURA: Rats have paper?

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.220
TALIESIN: Rats are made of paper.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.121
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:36:58.121 --> 00:37:00.054
TALIESIN: Which one did I hand you again?

00:37:00.054 --> 00:37:02.157
TRAVIS: Auspex, heightened awareness.

00:37:02.157 --> 00:37:08.645
TALIESIN: Boy, you &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; saw that rat, and you
got it.

00:37:08.645 --> 00:37:09.951
TRAVIS: I go right after it.

00:37:09.951 --> 00:37:13.755
TALIESIN: You catch it, and are you going to give
it a bite?

00:37:13.755 --> 00:37:15.764
TRAVIS: I'm going to give it a good little
(snarls).

00:37:15.764 --> 00:37:20.341
TALIESIN: Give me a die, and you're at one hunger.
By the way, your hunger level's however many

00:37:20.341 --> 00:37:23.116
red dice you have right now.

00:37:23.116 --> 00:37:26.856
LAURA: There should be some stunt weapons--

00:37:26.856 --> 00:37:31.960
TALIESIN: Not on the Nerdist set, they're not that
cool. Sorry, I'm going to be throwing so much

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.623
shade, it's going to be really bad.

00:37:33.623 --> 00:37:36.673
LAURA: But there's a closet right outside of the
stage.

00:37:36.673 --> 00:37:39.196
TALIESIN: There are, but that door is not opening.
You're going to have to maybe--

00:37:39.196 --> 00:37:40.364
LAURA: Go to the hallway door?

00:37:40.364 --> 00:37:41.587
TALIESIN: You can check to see if it'll open.

00:37:41.587 --> 00:37:42.849
LAURA: I'm going to try and get into the hallway
door.

00:37:42.849 --> 00:37:43.647
TALIESIN: Are you going to be--

00:37:43.647 --> 00:37:45.073
LAURA: Stealthy about it?

00:37:45.073 --> 00:37:46.371
TALIESIN: Are you going to try and be stealthy
about it?

00:37:46.371 --> 00:37:49.964
LAURA: I'm going to try and be stealthy about
opening the door. Quietly.

00:37:49.964 --> 00:37:51.963
TALIESIN: Super stealthy. How quietly are you
going to open the door?

00:37:51.963 --> 00:38:02.299
LAURA: So quietly? Super quietly? I'm going to
take a really long time pushing that little bar in.

00:38:02.299 --> 00:38:06.213
TALIESIN: Yeah, give me a dex stealth.

00:38:06.213 --> 00:38:19.100
LAURA: Okay. Whoa! Double zeroes, crit. And all
successes. Everything was a success.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.471
SAM: &lt;i&gt;All&lt;/i&gt; successes?

00:38:20.471 --> 00:38:21.623
LAURA: Yeah!

00:38:21.623 --> 00:38:26.545
TALIESIN: You start to vanish as you're pushing
the door, you're get a little--

00:38:26.545 --> 00:38:30.471
MATT: Yes!

00:38:30.471 --> 00:38:35.723
LAURA: Oh my god. How do I use this, what do I do
with this?!

00:38:35.723 --> 00:38:38.234
TALIESIN: You let me know when you want to want to
use it, and I'll tell you what roll to make, but

00:38:38.234 --> 00:38:42.680
there are rules to it right now! You can try and
get fancy with it later, and it might get fancy,

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:46.668
but play around, see what works and what doesn't.
You don't know how this shit works.

00:38:46.668 --> 00:38:51.402
LAURA: Okay. So I can open the door.

00:38:51.402 --> 00:38:53.196
TALIESIN: You can open the door very quietly.

00:38:53.196 --> 00:38:55.024
LIAM: So, we're going to find a phone, we're going
to call your nanny. You and I will get out of

00:38:55.024 --> 00:38:57.395
here, we'll get to your place, we'll get you home,
and then I'll go home.

00:38:57.395 --> 00:39:00.136
SAM: Sure, yeah. Amy must be worried.

00:39:00.136 --> 00:39:02.172
LIAM: I would assume.

00:39:02.172 --> 00:39:03.253
SAM: Yeah!

00:39:03.253 --> 00:39:09.858
TALIESIN: The lights in the hallway are
flickering. They're not working well. They've got

00:39:09.858 --> 00:39:13.408
that weird fluorescent crackle when things are
left to go to rot.

00:39:13.408 --> 00:39:15.531
LAURA: Can we hear any voices at all?

00:39:15.531 --> 00:39:22.939
TALIESIN: You can hear the hum of the server room
right across from you. And some sort of squishy

00:39:22.939 --> 00:39:29.004
sound coming from the server room. There's some
sort of awful (squishy noises).

00:39:29.004 --> 00:39:32.344
LAURA: Oh, that's foul. I'm going to go check it
out.

00:39:32.344 --> 00:39:33.876
TRAVIS: Where'd Laura go?

00:39:33.876 --> 00:39:39.091
SAM: I don't know. Are you okay?

00:39:39.091 --> 00:39:43.537
TRAVIS: I feel funny. I'm really hungry.

00:39:43.537 --> 00:39:49.705
SAM: Ooh, maybe they have leftover, what did we
have, Greek?

00:39:49.705 --> 00:39:53.132
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was like breakfast pizza and
gyros?

00:39:53.132 --> 00:39:54.920
SAM: Oh, it was Chinese!

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.921
LAURA: Yeah, we had Chinese.

00:39:56.921 --> 00:39:58.980
SAM: Maybe they have some leftover Chinese.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:02.136
MATT: While they're having this conversation, I
walk over in my Power Ranger helmet and follow

00:40:02.136 --> 00:40:05.855
behind Marisha and where Laura might be, because I
have no idea where she is.

00:40:05.855 --> 00:40:09.131
MARISHA: Oh, babe, we should look out for those
Warcraft props.

00:40:09.131 --> 00:40:11.105
MATT: Oh yeah!

00:40:11.105 --> 00:40:12.790
MARISHA: Those might also be worth some money.

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:15.581
TALIESIN: I literally have their location written
in my notes, that makes me so happy.

00:40:15.581 --> 00:40:16.692
MARISHA: Really?

00:40:16.692 --> 00:40:17.577
TALIESIN: Really.

00:40:17.577 --> 00:40:19.909
SAM: If we wanted to head to the kitchen, is that
the same direction they're going?

00:40:19.909 --> 00:40:20.814
LAURA: Yeah.

00:40:20.814 --> 00:40:23.108
TALIESIN: They're at least at the table, and
there's something happening in the server room.

00:40:23.108 --> 00:40:26.713
It's dark in the kitchen, but you can't quite tell
what's happening.

00:40:26.713 --> 00:40:30.200
MARISHA: Let's try and get to the kitchen.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.442
LIAM: Where?

00:40:31.442 --> 00:40:33.059
LAURA: You don't want to check out the server
room?

00:40:33.059 --> 00:40:34.806
MARISHA: Well, we've got to go that way anyway.

00:40:34.806 --> 00:40:37.490
TALIESIN: Everyone roll a dex stealth.

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:39.190
LAURA: Do I have to roll dex stealth?

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:44.677
TALIESIN: Since you did so well, I'm going to let
you walk one through, although that's not quite

00:40:44.677 --> 00:40:45.692
how it works.

00:40:45.692 --> 00:40:46.890
LAURA: Oh, really? Should I do it?

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:47.877
TALIESIN: No, I'll let you go.

00:40:47.877 --> 00:40:48.960
LIAM: Crit!

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.763
MARISHA: Ooh, I got two tens! Same thing!

00:40:50.763 --> 00:40:53.640
LAURA: Oh you got two tens, he got two tens as
well!

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.184
TALIESIN: Two tens? All right!

00:40:55.184 --> 00:40:56.585
MARISHA: And the rest are successes.

00:40:56.585 --> 00:40:57.426
TRAVIS and MATT: Two successes.

00:40:57.426 --> 00:40:59.344
SAM: One success.

00:40:59.344 --> 00:41:01.787
TALIESIN: You guys make a little bit of noise,
and--

00:41:01.787 --> 00:41:04.099
SAM: Isn't a crit two tens?

00:41:04.099 --> 00:41:05.503
LAURA: A crit is two tens.

00:41:05.503 --> 00:41:13.833
TALIESIN: --there's noise, there are things. You
don't see anybody, but you can hear stuff moving

00:41:13.833 --> 00:41:14.777
around.

00:41:14.777 --> 00:41:17.795
MARISHA: It's probably Sean, he works so late.

00:41:17.795 --> 00:41:23.679
TALIESIN: So the big door, the big door for the
Twitch studio.

00:41:23.679 --> 00:41:27.701
LAURA: You mean that door over there?

00:41:27.701 --> 00:41:31.401
TALIESIN: I mean, yes, as long as you're not
pointing in the game, because then you're pointing

00:41:31.401 --> 00:41:33.515
at the front, but if you're pointing at the table,
then yeah, that's the door.

00:41:33.515 --> 00:41:34.479
LAURA: Right.

00:41:34.479 --> 00:41:36.428
LIAM: No, she's Laura, she's not Laura. She's
Laura, not Laura.

00:41:36.428 --> 00:41:39.232
TALIESIN: I'm trying to find my points.

00:41:39.232 --> 00:41:42.629
(creepy ambient sound, repeating "Where are
you?")

00:41:42.629 --> 00:41:45.383
LAURA: "Where are you," did you hear that?!
Creepy! Ugh!

00:41:45.383 --> 00:41:51.527
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's some weird sounds coming
from everywhere, but there's a big, bloody sign

00:41:51.527 --> 00:41:54.064
written on the main door to the Twitch stage.

00:41:54.064 --> 00:41:56.571
MARISHA: Does it say, "Things are getting
creepy?"

00:41:56.571 --> 00:42:00.058
SAM: Does it say, "Is it Thursday yet?"

00:42:00.058 --> 00:42:06.362
TALIESIN: It says, "I was born in a box, how do I
end?" With a question mark.

00:42:06.362 --> 00:42:09.672
LAURA: Wait a minute, does that mean other people
came out of coffins, too?

00:42:09.672 --> 00:42:16.023
TALIESIN: And below it is a circle that's been
drawn in blood, and set into four corners. In one

00:42:16.023 --> 00:42:24.912
corner is a heart, in another corner there's a
face, in the other corner is a glowing sun, and in

00:42:24.912 --> 00:42:27.318
the other corner is a cross with a circle.

00:42:27.318 --> 00:42:30.919
MARISHA: It's a box?

00:42:30.919 --> 00:42:38.929
TALIESIN: It's a circle, cut in four. With a heart,
a head, a sun, and a cross.

00:42:38.929 --> 00:42:42.310
MATT: Where are the Warcraft weapons?

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:46.969
LAURA: Are they in the stock closet, in the closet
that's got the props?

00:42:46.969 --> 00:42:48.369
MARISHA: They might be in the prop closet.

00:42:48.369 --> 00:42:51.521
TALIESIN: Right, does anybody actually have a card
key that gives them access to the prop closet?

00:42:51.521 --> 00:42:52.569
TRAVIS: I don't.

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:53.665
LAURA: I bet Marisha does!

00:42:53.665 --> 00:42:54.759
MARISHA: I do!

00:42:54.759 --> 00:42:56.009
TALIESIN: Where is it?

00:42:56.009 --> 00:43:01.246
MARISHA: It's on Sean's desk. I've got to get to
the desk, I've got to get to my office.

00:43:01.246 --> 00:43:02.579
MATT: I'll come with you to the office.

00:43:02.579 --> 00:43:03.690
MARISHA: Okay.

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:07.416
LIAM: Is it as we remember it, or is there debris
everywhere?

00:43:07.416 --> 00:43:12.053
TALIESIN: The Foosball table is missing, the couch
has been overturned.

00:43:12.053 --> 00:43:14.155
LAURA: Are there Lucky Charms in the cabinet?

00:43:14.155 --> 00:43:17.181
TALIESIN: There are in fact, for some strange
reason, Lucky Charms in the cabinet.

00:43:17.181 --> 00:43:18.598
LAURA: Can I try to eat some Lucky Charms?

00:43:18.598 --> 00:43:25.366
TALIESIN: You can, go ahead and have a handful.
They taste like rat droppings. You can still taste

00:43:25.366 --> 00:43:28.584
them. It's the worst thing ever.

00:43:28.584 --> 00:43:30.020
LAURA: Even the marshmallows?

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:34.861
TALIESIN: The marshmallows are like fuzzy bits of
lint inside of rat droppings, I'm so sorry. It

00:43:34.861 --> 00:43:36.059
doesn't taste right.

00:43:36.059 --> 00:43:37.509
TRAVIS: What's the matter with you, you love Lucky
Charms!

00:43:37.509 --> 00:43:39.661
LAURA: (sadly) I love Lucky Charms. These taste
like shit.

00:43:39.661 --> 00:43:40.713
TRAVIS: Are they old?

00:43:40.713 --> 00:43:42.121
LAURA: I don't think that's what it is.

00:43:42.121 --> 00:43:44.972
LIAM: You're crazy.

00:43:44.972 --> 00:43:47.901
LAURA: They taste like shit.

00:43:47.901 --> 00:43:50.808
LIAM: Ugh!

00:43:50.808 --> 00:43:52.635
MATT: Let's make our way to Sean's office.

00:43:52.635 --> 00:43:53.868
TALIESIN: Reroll stealth before you do.

00:43:53.868 --> 00:43:59.889
MATT: Okay. Trying to be careful as we go past the
server room glass window.

00:43:59.889 --> 00:44:04.665
MARISHA: What was it again? Dex and--?

00:44:04.665 --> 00:44:05.860
MATT: Stealth.

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:07.126
TALIESIN: Dex stealth.

00:44:07.126 --> 00:44:08.400
MATT: That's one success!

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.483
LAURA: Just one?

00:44:09.483 --> 00:44:11.130
MATT: Just one. I'm not very stealthy.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:12.245
LAURA: Oh no!

00:44:12.245 --> 00:44:13.356
TALIESIN: Oh no.

00:44:13.356 --> 00:44:16.296
MARISHA: Double failures. On the red.

00:44:16.296 --> 00:44:20.523
LAURA: Everything else was a success though!

00:44:20.523 --> 00:44:21.662
LIAM: Doesn't matter!

00:44:21.662 --> 00:44:25.620
MARISHA: Yeah, everything else was real good!

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:31.532
LIAM: It's just like the end of the Vox Machina
story! Goodbye!

00:44:31.532 --> 00:44:34.028
TALIESIN: What's your current hunger?

00:44:34.028 --> 00:44:36.599
LAURA: She's got two dice.

00:44:36.599 --> 00:44:43.091
MARISHA: Yeah, two, yeah. They both were ones. The
red ones were ones.

00:44:43.091 --> 00:44:51.253
TALIESIN: Yeah, your forehead starts to elongate a
little bit, and your eyes begin to glow, you start

00:44:51.253 --> 00:44:55.733
to kind of have a little bit of a twitch, and
you're getting a little feral.

00:44:55.733 --> 00:44:58.478
MARISHA: Do I see my reflection in the server room
window?

00:44:58.478 --> 00:45:01.527
TALIESIN: You &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; see your reflection in the
server room window. Are you looking in the server

00:45:01.527 --> 00:45:02.675
room window?

00:45:02.675 --> 00:45:03.593
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:45:03.593 --> 00:45:04.990
TALIESIN: That's not a server.

00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:07.889
MARISHA: What do you mean that's not--? What?

00:45:07.889 --> 00:45:13.862
TALIESIN: Whatever's in the server room, it
doesn't quite look like a server.

00:45:13.862 --> 00:45:16.697
MARISHA: Does it still look like a big, fatty
computer?

00:45:16.697 --> 00:45:19.263
TALIESIN: If they made them out of meat.

00:45:19.263 --> 00:45:23.060
MATT, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Meat computer.

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:26.598
LAURA: Gross!

00:45:26.598 --> 00:45:28.824
MATT: It's probably MSI.

00:45:28.824 --> 00:45:37.242
TALIESIN: Normally I wouldn't do this on this, but
it's amusing me. So even though this was a

00:45:37.242 --> 00:45:45.326
failure, I figure I may as well hit that now since
you started to change. The server is pulsating and

00:45:45.326 --> 00:45:50.681
thwapping against the window like it's trying to
get out.

00:45:50.681 --> 00:45:55.413
MATT: Do we see any discernable features beyond
being a mass of flesh?

00:45:55.413 --> 00:45:59.056
TALIESIN: How close to the window--? Make a
perception roll into the window.

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:04.515
MATT: We're trying to say on the other side of the
hallway as we creep by. Just perception?

00:46:04.515 --> 00:46:10.391
TALIESIN: You can do perception investigation, if
you like, or perception awareness.

00:46:10.391 --> 00:46:18.698
MATT: Three successes and one failure on the red
die.

00:46:18.698 --> 00:46:23.014
TALIESIN: One failure on the red die? You are
suddenly panicked when you realize-- you get

00:46:23.014 --> 00:46:26.908
distracted for looking in the room when you realize
that you can see Marisha's reflection, but you

00:46:26.908 --> 00:46:28.403
don't see yours.

00:46:28.403 --> 00:46:30.513
MATT: I know what this means!

00:46:30.513 --> 00:46:34.533
MARISHA: Babe! This is some Buffy shit!

00:46:34.533 --> 00:46:36.200
MATT: It's pretty fucking cool.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.911
MARISHA: Look how awesome! Do I look cool?

00:46:37.911 --> 00:46:42.931
MATT: Pretty badass. I got to take a picture, but
I see my phone's not there. I'm like: Oh shit, sorry.

00:46:42.931 --> 00:46:48.986
TALIESIN: Suddenly, the door to the server room
bursts open.

00:46:48.986 --> 00:46:51.903
LAURA: Do we hear it in the kitchen?

00:46:51.903 --> 00:46:53.454
TALIESIN: It flies open.

00:46:53.454 --> 00:46:55.646
LAURA: Oh shit! I go running to see what the noise
is.

00:46:55.646 --> 00:47:00.578
TALIESIN: As you stop, you see Dani Carr.

00:47:00.578 --> 00:47:01.660
LIAM: No!

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:02.624
MARISHA: Dani!

00:47:02.624 --> 00:47:09.845
TALIESIN: With a big smile on her face. A very big
smile on the face. And a tea set! And she ignores

00:47:09.845 --> 00:47:16.583
you and takes the tea over into the Geek &amp;amp; Sundry
bullpen, humming a little tune as the door shuts

00:47:16.583 --> 00:47:19.060
behind her with whatever's writhing and wriggling
in there.

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:21.266
MARISHA: Wait, did she us?

00:47:21.266 --> 00:47:24.546
TALIESIN: She didn't seem to acknowledge you.

00:47:24.546 --> 00:47:27.752
LIAM: She came out of the server room and went
into Nerdist?

00:47:27.752 --> 00:47:37.856
TALIESIN: She looked a little gaunt, definitely,
but her eyes had sunken in a little bit and her

00:47:37.856 --> 00:47:46.220
skin was a little too tight for her skull.
Everything looked a little thinned and darkened.

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:49.748
MATT: Marisha, I think we're all fucked up.

00:47:49.748 --> 00:47:53.388
LAURA: What the fuck happened to Marisha's face?

00:47:53.388 --> 00:47:55.253
MARISHA: Look, isn't it awesome?

00:47:55.253 --> 00:48:01.145
TALIESIN: To the bullpen. To the Geek &amp;amp; Sundry
bullpen to Marisha and Sean's office in the back.

00:48:01.145 --> 00:48:02.697
LIAM: I'm going to follow her. Dani!

00:48:02.697 --> 00:48:05.293
TALIESIN: How close are you going to get?

00:48:05.293 --> 00:48:07.702
MARISHA: I've got to get the key card, so I'll go
with you.

00:48:07.702 --> 00:48:09.335
LIAM: 30 feet behind. D?

00:48:09.335 --> 00:48:10.799
MARISHA: Continuing my mission.

00:48:10.799 --> 00:48:12.169
LIAM: Dani?

00:48:12.169 --> 00:48:23.788
TALIESIN: She's ignoring. She takes the tea set,
if you can look around, into Sean's office,

00:48:23.788 --> 00:48:28.636
humming the whole time. The door shuts behind her.
You couldn't get a good look at what's going on.

00:48:28.636 --> 00:48:30.296
The lights, again, are all a little iffy.

00:48:30.296 --> 00:48:32.533
MARISHA: We've never fucking drank tea.

00:48:32.533 --> 00:48:38.889
TALIESIN: If you're crawling in that direction,
you can definitely start taking a look around and

00:48:38.889 --> 00:48:44.019
see what's up there as I find my bullpen.

00:48:44.019 --> 00:48:47.161
LIAM: I don't remember exactly what's in the
Nerdist offices, but it's full of shit. Is there

00:48:47.161 --> 00:48:48.643
anything I could grab as a weapon?

00:48:48.643 --> 00:48:52.218
TALIESIN: Other than a commemorative Chun Li
statue.

00:48:52.218 --> 00:48:53.998
LIAM: I'm taking it.

00:48:53.998 --> 00:48:55.363
MARISHA and LAURA: Those are heavy!

00:48:55.363 --> 00:48:59.532
MATT: Can I look for social's, Chris' sword that
he always attacks people with?

00:48:59.532 --> 00:49:00.705
TALIESIN: The foam one?

00:49:00.705 --> 00:49:01.532
MATT: The foam one.

00:49:01.532 --> 00:49:03.120
TALIESIN: Are you going into the Geek &amp;amp; Sundry
bullpen?

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.096
MATT: To look for that, yes.

00:49:04.096 --> 00:49:05.525
TALIESIN: Chris is in the bullpen.

00:49:05.525 --> 00:49:07.553
MATT: I go: Chris, give me your foam sword!

00:49:07.553 --> 00:49:16.382
TALIESIN: Chris is ignoring you. Chris is sitting
at his desk and his eyes have sunken all the way

00:49:16.382 --> 00:49:23.417
almost into the back of his head. His mouth is
very terse and he's wearing a sign and he's

00:49:23.417 --> 00:49:29.530
working on the socials. You also see that the
window has been blocked and covered.

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:33.132
LAURA: Do they look like us, or do they look
like--?

00:49:33.132 --> 00:49:40.205
TALIESIN: They look like people wearing some weird
makeup who are very dehydrated and they're all

00:49:40.205 --> 00:49:43.211
wearing signs around their neck and really trying
hard--

00:49:43.211 --> 00:49:44.520
LAURA: Signs around their neck?

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:48.136
TALIESIN: Are you going in enough to see it?

00:49:48.136 --> 00:49:51.866
MATT: Yeah! I was going to go bug him and: Chris!
What's wrong with you?

00:49:51.866 --> 00:50:01.517
TALIESIN: As far as you can see so far,
between Chris, Sax, Arcade, and Audrey, they are

00:50:01.517 --> 00:50:05.580
all occasionally making eye contact with you, but
not really keeping it, and they're all wearing

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:07.056
signs that say "Drink Me."

00:50:07.056 --> 00:50:09.658
SAM and LAURA: Ugh.

00:50:09.658 --> 00:50:17.893
TALIESIN: They are terrified. Is anybody above a
hunger three right now? Three or above? Do you

00:50:17.893 --> 00:50:20.402
have three red dice, or is everybody at least at
two?

00:50:20.402 --> 00:50:21.766
MATT, LAURA, and TRAVIS: One.

00:50:21.766 --> 00:50:22.787
SAM and MARISHA: Two.

00:50:22.787 --> 00:50:38.265
TALIESIN: They smell weirdly good. There's an
almost candied sensation.

00:50:38.265 --> 00:50:40.371
LAURA: Do they smell like Lucky Charms?

00:50:40.371 --> 00:50:48.767
TALIESIN: They smell like the first bowl of Lucky
Charms you ever had in your life. They are all

00:50:48.767 --> 00:50:54.340
sitting at their desks, either working or
pretending to work, it's hard to tell. Dani comes

00:50:54.340 --> 00:51:01.259
bursting out of the office without a tea tray,
sits down at her desk and meets your gaze.

00:51:01.259 --> 00:51:04.596
TRAVIS: Who did she deliver tea to?

00:51:04.596 --> 00:51:06.396
LIAM: Dani?

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:08.018
TALIESIN: "Yeah?"

00:51:08.018 --> 00:51:09.245
LIAM: What's going on?

00:51:09.245 --> 00:51:12.735
TALIESIN: "Oh, you're all awake! That's great."

00:51:12.735 --> 00:51:16.870
MARISHA: Dani. Sean doesn't drink tea.

00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:20.091
TALIESIN: "Sean doesn't drink tea, that's true."

00:51:20.091 --> 00:51:21.549
MARISHA: Is Sean in there?

00:51:21.549 --> 00:51:23.541
TALIESIN: "No. No, Sean's working on the server."

00:51:23.541 --> 00:51:28.498
LAURA: Ugh. How long were we sleeping?

00:51:28.498 --> 00:51:36.572
TALIESIN: "Who can say? That's just a matter of
opinion, that could be anything. I'd have to ask

00:51:36.572 --> 00:51:37.857
"upstairs. I could write an email!"

00:51:37.857 --> 00:51:39.510
LIAM: Do you know what's going on?

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:44.885
TALIESIN: "Of course! Of course I know what's
going on; that's my job. I know what's going on."

00:51:44.885 --> 00:51:47.393
LAURA: Why were we in the coffins?

00:51:47.393 --> 00:51:51.857
TALIESIN: "I don't understand the question. That's
odd."

00:51:51.857 --> 00:51:53.818
TRAVIS: Who did you give the tea to?

00:51:53.818 --> 00:51:55.850
TALIESIN: "Oh, they're having a creative meeting
right now."

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:57.279
SAM: Who's they?

00:51:57.279 --> 00:51:58.573
TALIESIN: "The creative team."

00:51:58.573 --> 00:52:00.957
MARISHA: Why the fuck didn't I get an email?!

00:52:00.957 --> 00:52:03.442
LAURA: You were in a coffin, dude, you might have
gotten an email.

00:52:03.442 --> 00:52:06.625
LIAM: Is this a Geek &amp;amp; Sundry thing or an LDN
thing?

00:52:06.625 --> 00:52:11.534
TALIESIN: This is most assuredly an LDN thing.

00:52:11.534 --> 00:52:15.056
(laughter)

00:52:15.056 --> 00:52:21.524
TALIESIN: "Well, ask me no more questions, and
I'll tell you no more lies!"

00:52:21.524 --> 00:52:26.453
TRAVIS: Can I make my way out of the bullpen, back
towards the server room?

00:52:26.453 --> 00:52:28.158
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:52:28.158 --> 00:52:31.144
TRAVIS: Can I approach the server room window?

00:52:31.144 --> 00:52:32.327
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:52:32.327 --> 00:52:34.019
TRAVIS: Can I look inside?

00:52:34.019 --> 00:52:43.602
TALIESIN: Yeah. Give me a perception investigation
because you don't have an awareness issue.

00:52:43.602 --> 00:52:49.556
TRAVIS: Oh god. Three successes.

00:52:49.556 --> 00:53:02.460
TALIESIN: That thing in there is definitely meat
and it's some sort of weird-- it's built out of a

00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:09.300
lot of different things and it seems to be
interconnected to something that goes up higher

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:13.447
into the building. It's part of some sort of
machine.

00:53:13.447 --> 00:53:15.749
TRAVIS: Do I smell anything?

00:53:15.749 --> 00:53:20.083
TALIESIN: It smells kind of good. Not great, but
it smells pretty good.

00:53:20.083 --> 00:53:21.333
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:53:21.333 --> 00:53:23.573
TALIESIN: But it's locked.

00:53:23.573 --> 00:53:25.489
TRAVIS: I don't see Sean anywhere?

00:53:25.489 --> 00:53:32.300
TALIESIN: Not that you can tell. How well and
intimately do you know Sean? Could you recognize

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:39.514
him by just parts? You don't see his head
anywhere, I'll go that far.

00:53:39.514 --> 00:53:42.669
LIAM: You've seen his head.

00:53:42.669 --> 00:53:44.588
TALIESIN: Man, I warned y'all.

00:53:44.588 --> 00:53:47.875
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know!

00:53:47.875 --> 00:53:50.928
MATT: Is this an amalgamation of many parts, or it
one giant, pulsating Tetsuo type thing?

00:53:50.928 --> 00:53:54.717
LAURA: I know, I was picturing a big flesh blob,
but it's body parts?

00:53:54.717 --> 00:53:59.945
TALIESIN: Yeah, if you look really closely you
tell that there's parts that were not ground up

00:53:59.945 --> 00:54:01.451
appropriately and are definitely--

00:54:01.451 --> 00:54:02.508
LAURA: Ground up?!

00:54:02.508 --> 00:54:08.892
MATT: Chris, give your sword! I shake him. Give me
your sword!

00:54:08.892 --> 00:54:12.947
TALIESIN: Chris is frozen with fear.

00:54:12.947 --> 00:54:14.660
MATT: I look around for the sword.

00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:16.446
TALIESIN: There is a foam sword by his--

00:54:16.446 --> 00:54:18.051
MATT: I take it!

00:54:18.051 --> 00:54:22.512
TALIESIN: He almost tells you not to take it, and then
thinks better of it when Dani looks at him.

00:54:22.512 --> 00:54:28.160
LIAM: I set Chun Li down on Dani's desk. Dani,
we're going to get the fuck out of here, and we're

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:31.640
going to take you with us. You need to tell me
what the fuck is going on so we can work together

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:32.849
to get the fuck out!

00:54:32.849 --> 00:54:36.615
TALIESIN: "We won't know what's going on until the
creative meeting is over. You would have to talk

00:54:36.615 --> 00:54:37.543
"to them."

00:54:37.543 --> 00:54:38.768
LIAM: You are talking like a crazy person!

00:54:38.768 --> 00:54:40.443
MARISHA: I'm going to go in the creative meeting.

00:54:40.443 --> 00:54:41.557
TALIESIN: Yay!

00:54:41.557 --> 00:54:45.675
MARISHA: They're in my office.

00:54:45.675 --> 00:54:47.138
MATT: It's true.

00:54:47.138 --> 00:54:52.280
TRAVIS: There's no writing or sign on the door
that says, "Drive-Thru"?

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:56.949
TALIESIN: You go into the creative meeting?

00:54:56.949 --> 00:54:58.301
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:54:58.301 --> 00:55:00.348
TALIESIN: You walk in.

00:55:00.348 --> 00:55:02.391
LIAM: Fuck it. I pick up Chun Li and I back her
up.

00:55:02.391 --> 00:55:13.176
TALIESIN: Inside are Eric, and I think it's Matt
Key. Eric's sitting on the little green grass

00:55:13.176 --> 00:55:20.864
carpet. They've got the tea set out. There's a
couple different tea cups and he's sitting there

00:55:20.864 --> 00:55:29.698
having a sip of tea. Weirdly, Whitney Moore is
sitting there with him.

00:55:29.698 --> 00:55:33.621
LIAM: Does it look normal in here? They're not,
but the room?

00:55:33.621 --> 00:55:41.132
TALIESIN: They look normal, except their eyes.
There's large black circles around their eyes and

00:55:41.193 --> 00:55:49.289
their mouths are blackened over in this very weird
gray puffy mold. It's almost like there's a mold

00:55:49.289 --> 00:55:56.151
around their mouths and eyes. In the corner is
Matt Key, who is working on an iPad, but it's only

00:55:56.151 --> 00:56:08.483
the arm and the head of Matt Key. He seems to have
sprouted spores. There's an old, flowering pile of

00:56:08.483 --> 00:56:14.410
gray mushrooms that still have Matt Key's face and
hand as he's working in the corner that has

00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:23.541
crawled up and covered the window. Eric and
Whitney see you come in and go, "Oh thank god,

00:56:23.541 --> 00:56:31.281
"Marisha, we've been waiting. It has been very
weird. Come down, have some tea, it's just what

00:56:31.281 --> 00:56:34.170
"you need." As they sit and drink tea.

00:56:34.170 --> 00:56:38.386
SAM: Are there any telephones around, Taliesin?

00:56:38.386 --> 00:56:40.676
TALIESIN: Have you ever seen a telephone in this
place?

00:56:40.676 --> 00:56:42.242
LAURA: Where's Taliesin?

00:56:42.242 --> 00:56:48.719
TALIESIN: There was an extra hole in the ground
and I was already broken open. That's all I'm

00:56:48.719 --> 00:56:59.879
going to say. They're giggling a lot and they're
talking about "Dad." "Dad's coming back any second

00:56:59.879 --> 00:57:05.649
"now. Dad has plans. Have some tea. We'll explain
everything."

00:57:05.649 --> 00:57:07.610
SAM: Don't have the tea.

00:57:07.610 --> 00:57:11.801
MARISHA: Is this a coup? Is Taliesin taking over?
What did Taliesin do?

00:57:11.801 --> 00:57:13.172
SAM: Where's Taliesin?

00:57:13.172 --> 00:57:14.232
LAURA: There was a hole.

00:57:14.232 --> 00:57:19.305
TALIESIN: "Taliesin was here. Taliesin left. He
went to go deal with something. But Taliesin was here."

00:57:19.305 --> 00:57:20.599
SAM: Which way did he go?

00:57:20.599 --> 00:57:21.695
TALIESIN: "Out."

00:57:21.695 --> 00:57:27.490
LAURA: Outside? Should we leave? Let's leave.

00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:28.754
SAM: Yeah!

00:57:28.754 --> 00:57:29.930
LAURA: I'm going to walk towards the front door.

00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:31.077
SAM: I'm joining Laura.

00:57:31.077 --> 00:57:32.432
TALIESIN: You're going to walk towards the front
door?

00:57:32.432 --> 00:57:33.520
LAURA and SAM: Yeah.

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:38.567
MATT: Before they do that, because I saw my lack
of a reflection. Is it day or night outside?

00:57:38.567 --> 00:57:41.124
TALIESIN: You don't know. You actually haven't
seen a working window yet.

00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:42.438
MATT: They're all blocked?

00:57:42.438 --> 00:57:43.771
TALIESIN: So far!

00:57:43.771 --> 00:57:52.233
MATT: I'm going to say: Hey! Be careful! Be slow.
Some of us might be sensitive to sunlight.

00:57:52.233 --> 00:57:53.781
SAM: Oh.

00:57:53.853 --> 00:57:59.223
MATT: I point. Marisha's probably still back in
the office. You saw Marisha's face?!

00:57:59.223 --> 00:58:05.636
TALIESIN: Eric and Whitney see you do this and
laugh their ass off. And then, "Key! Key! Put that

00:58:05.636 --> 00:58:10.816
"in, put that in, that's great! That's great! Aw,
Matt! Matt! Genius! No, we're going to use that!"

00:58:10.816 --> 00:58:14.751
MATT: I never get this kind of positive feedback,
I'm actually liking this.

00:58:14.751 --> 00:58:17.286
LAURA: Yeah, right.

00:58:17.286 --> 00:58:19.380
LIAM: Key. Key, buddy. You doing all right?

00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:25.994
TALIESIN: Key has a smile and he's writing
everything down. He's just iPad-ing, "Key. Key,

00:58:25.994 --> 00:58:27.260
"buddy. You doing all right?"

00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:31.191
MARISHA: I'm going to go look over Key's shoulder,
look at his iPad. Scroll up.

00:58:31.191 --> 00:58:46.814
TALIESIN: Roll a straight dexterity roll.
Dexterity dodge. Let's get weird.

00:58:46.814 --> 00:58:56.585
MARISHA: Sure! All successes except for one.

00:58:56.585 --> 00:59:01.773
TALIESIN: All successes except for one? He's been
writing down everything the two of them have said.

00:59:01.773 --> 00:59:05.827
MARISHA: Is there anything that we have said
further up in the document?

00:59:05.827 --> 00:59:08.412
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, it's all there. He's taken down
every note of everything he can hear.

00:59:08.412 --> 00:59:09.931
MARISHA: Including when we weren't in the room?

00:59:09.931 --> 00:59:12.202
TALIESIN: No. It's a creative meeting.

00:59:12.202 --> 00:59:13.524
MARISHA: Right.

00:59:13.524 --> 00:59:18.708
LIAM: Key. Buddy. I voice Doctor Strange. You love
Doctor Strange! Key!

00:59:18.708 --> 00:59:21.215
TALIESIN: He writes, "I voice Doctor Strange. I
love Doctor Strange. Key!"

00:59:21.215 --> 00:59:25.351
LIAM: Can I poke his face a little bit?

00:59:25.351 --> 00:59:28.122
TALIESIN: It's gray and weird looking.

00:59:28.122 --> 00:59:30.077
LIAM: I'm going to poke it.

00:59:30.077 --> 00:59:39.283
TALIESIN: All right. Roll stanima.

00:59:39.283 --> 00:59:44.057
LAURA, MARISHA, and MATT: Stanima?

00:59:44.057 --> 00:59:50.805
TALIESIN: Stamina. Roll stanima. What am I going
to add to that? Just roll stanima--

00:59:50.805 --> 00:59:52.296
LIAM: Oh shite.

00:59:52.296 --> 00:59:53.846
SAM: I think he thinks it's "stanima"!

00:59:53.846 --> 00:59:55.596
TALIESIN: I can't say it right, I know.

00:59:55.596 --> 00:59:58.070
LIAM: It's a lot of pressure behind that screen,
man.

00:59:58.070 --> 01:00:09.659
LIAM: Not on the red one, but the non-red is a
failure-- Two failures, and the red one is a

01:00:09.659 --> 01:00:10.943
success.

01:00:10.943 --> 01:00:12.715
TALIESIN: So just a failure on the one--

01:00:12.715 --> 01:00:14.204
LIAM: Failure on the non-reds.

01:00:14.204 --> 01:00:21.063
TALIESIN: Okay, but a success on the reds.
Nothing. This is going to sound weird, roll

01:00:21.063 --> 01:00:22.535
charisma persuasion.

01:00:22.535 --> 01:00:32.947
LIAM: Charisma and persuasion. Yes. Yas, Key.
Where the frig is persuasion? Where is it? There

01:00:32.947 --> 01:00:34.145
it is.

01:00:34.145 --> 01:00:37.535
TALIESIN: There's still tea.

01:00:37.535 --> 01:00:44.707
LIAM: Four failures, the red is a nine, and a
non-red success.

01:00:44.707 --> 01:00:48.252
TALIESIN: It doesn't matter where a failure is,
just tell me the number of successes.

01:00:48.252 --> 01:00:50.475
LIAM: Two successes, one of which is on a red.

01:00:50.475 --> 01:00:55.660
TALIESIN: Okay, and the other red didn't hit a
one? It doesn't matter failures, it's just

01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:56.658
successes.

01:00:56.658 --> 01:00:57.824
LIAM: I only have one red die, though.

01:00:57.824 --> 01:01:04.758
TALIESIN: So it's fine. So two successes.
Actually, hold on. That's right, I can do this.

01:01:04.758 --> 01:01:06.685
I've got a thing for this.

01:01:06.685 --> 01:01:08.243
LIAM: And I smell my finger.

01:01:08.243 --> 01:01:13.037
LAURA: Gross. Why are you licking and smelling
your fingers?

01:01:13.037 --> 01:01:14.951
LIAM: You've known me for so long.

01:01:14.951 --> 01:01:16.471
LAURA: You've got a piece of paper.

01:01:16.471 --> 01:01:17.670
LIAM: What is it?

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:23.974
LAURA: What is it?

01:01:23.974 --> 01:01:32.954
TALIESIN: Key actually twitches and you hear this
snap of a whole bunch of mushrooms and spores as

01:01:32.954 --> 01:01:35.663
his neck (clicks). There's a little puff.

01:01:35.663 --> 01:01:40.881
MARISHA: Does the spore puff do anything?

01:01:40.881 --> 01:01:44.194
TALIESIN: Were you close enough to sniff it?

01:01:44.194 --> 01:01:46.184
MARISHA: I was leaning over his shoulder.

01:01:46.184 --> 01:01:47.656
LAURA: Oh shit, you were.

01:01:47.656 --> 01:01:52.093
TALIESIN: "We're going to add that in. It's going
to be great."

01:01:52.093 --> 01:01:58.922
LIAM: Are you aware this is not a normal situation
right now?

01:01:58.922 --> 01:02:04.032
TALIESIN: "Oh yeah, we have Alpha money. We've
never had this kind of money before. They're

01:02:04.032 --> 01:02:11.852
"letting us do so much." Did you sniff the snorts?
Spores. (mispronouncing) Sniff the spores? Sniff

01:02:11.852 --> 01:02:12.822
the s'mores?

01:02:12.822 --> 01:02:14.238
MARISHA: I don't know, did I sniff the spores?

01:02:14.238 --> 01:02:19.578
TALIESIN: There were s'mores, but-- Roll stanima,
just tell me what happens.

01:02:19.578 --> 01:02:30.943
MARISHA: Stanima? I've got to think about it now.
Just straight stanima?

01:02:30.943 --> 01:02:32.809
TALIESIN: Feels good to be on the other end of
this, doesn't it?

01:02:32.809 --> 01:02:34.005
MATT: Yeah. But I feel for you.

01:02:34.005 --> 01:02:35.664
TALIESIN: Fuck off. Yes.

01:02:35.664 --> 01:02:37.836
(laughter)

01:02:37.836 --> 01:02:39.457
LIAM: Smell the siggle.

01:02:39.457 --> 01:02:40.972
MARISHA: Two successes.

01:02:40.972 --> 01:02:50.658
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're fine. Nothing weird. You do
notice that the tea they're pouring is red. And it

01:02:50.658 --> 01:02:51.948
smells pretty good.

01:02:51.948 --> 01:03:02.085
MARISHA: It's blood! I'm so thirsty. Okay, I sit
down on the grass. Is Arwen here?

01:03:02.085 --> 01:03:08.075
TALIESIN: No Arwen. Probably for the best, because
I'm not that, you know.

01:03:08.075 --> 01:03:11.141
MARISHA: I have some tea.

01:03:11.141 --> 01:03:22.828
TALIESIN: So as you sip the tea, Eric and Whitney
giggle, talk, and make notes. "There's a big thing

01:03:22.828 --> 01:03:33.358
"happening tonight. There's going to be a big new
change to the show. And as soon as we get that

01:03:33.358 --> 01:03:42.206
"little lock problem off of the Twitch stage,
everything will be great. We've been trying to

01:03:42.206 --> 01:03:47.892
"figure out how to open the Twitch stage, and
there's a little lock, and he's very excited for

01:03:47.892 --> 01:03:53.938
"you to figure out his little puzzle. He says it
shouldn't be too hard for people like you to

01:03:53.938 --> 01:03:54.857
"figure out."

01:03:54.857 --> 01:03:56.357
MARISHA: Oh, you've been talking to the lock.

01:03:56.357 --> 01:04:01.056
TALIESIN: "We've been talking to Father. Father
has been helping us redesign the show, it's going

01:04:01.056 --> 01:04:02.303
"to be really good."

01:04:02.303 --> 01:04:04.971
MARISHA: Wait, is Father Father his full name?
Like first name, Father, last name, Father?

01:04:04.971 --> 01:04:15.931
TALIESIN: "No. (giggling) No, he's very excited,
though. He's very excited for you to figure out

01:04:15.931 --> 01:04:32.089
"his little riddle. It's going to be good. You
should figure out his riddle. Can we help you? I

01:04:32.089 --> 01:04:36.559
"mean, I know you're not supposed to be in this
meeting. We're really thankful that you're here, but--"

01:04:36.559 --> 01:04:40.617
MARISHA: It's my fucking office, bitches.

01:04:40.617 --> 01:04:43.272
TALIESIN: "Sure, but we kind of had the room?"

01:04:43.272 --> 01:04:45.164
TRAVIS: Try the tea.

01:04:45.164 --> 01:04:46.791
MARISHA: I've been drinking the tea.

01:04:46.791 --> 01:04:52.318
TALIESIN: It tastes good. It tastes a little
weird. It tastes really good. Tastes like blood.

01:04:52.318 --> 01:04:54.710
It's a little bitter. It's good.

01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:59.125
LAURA: Maybe it's like mushroom blood tea.

01:04:59.125 --> 01:05:06.606
MARISHA: I'm not getting dosed, am I? That would
suck.

01:05:06.606 --> 01:05:07.982
TALIESIN: We'll find out, won't we?

01:05:07.982 --> 01:05:09.094
LAURA: Did we make it to the front door yet?

01:05:09.094 --> 01:05:10.003
SAM: Yeah, we're hustling.

01:05:10.003 --> 01:05:12.675
TALIESIN: You want to hustle? As you turn the
corner to the front door--

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:14.559
LIAM: Wait, Eric, did you get your suit for the
wedding?

01:05:14.559 --> 01:05:18.644
TALIESIN: "Yeah."

01:05:18.644 --> 01:05:21.841
LAURA: It's definitely a flesh suit.

01:05:21.841 --> 01:05:27.717
TALIESIN: Of course it is. As you turn the corner,
Lego Hardwick has been propped up in front of a

01:05:27.717 --> 01:05:32.862
red velvet curtain, with a sign that's blocking
off the whole front.

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:36.091
SAM: What does the sign say?

01:05:36.091 --> 01:05:38.596
TALIESIN: It says "Your funeral."

01:05:38.596 --> 01:05:44.840
MATT: That's not ominous at all, from a giant Lego
Hardwick.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:49.269
TALIESIN: Somehow he looks less creepy. I'm not
entirely sure how they pulled that off.

01:05:49.269 --> 01:05:53.235
LAURA: Do you think it's because Matt said we're
light sensitive?

01:05:53.235 --> 01:05:56.361
SAM: Maybe. Do you want to peek out?

01:05:56.361 --> 01:05:58.785
LAURA: I can try. Do you want to do it?

01:05:58.785 --> 01:06:03.183
SAM: I'll hold you so if you cry out in pain, I'll
pull you back.

01:06:03.183 --> 01:06:07.400
TALIESIN: Matt, really quickly, roll a wits and
willpower.

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:16.509
SAM: Taliesin, Laura's going to peek out.

01:06:16.509 --> 01:06:18.747
LAURA: Sam's going to hold onto my back.

01:06:18.747 --> 01:06:20.359
TALIESIN: Hold on.

01:06:20.359 --> 01:06:29.990
MATT: That was a good roll for me. That is a crit
success, with six successes.

01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:37.456
TALIESIN: You felt a weird push towards that
curtain that you can't quite identify. That was

01:06:37.456 --> 01:06:40.785
very odd. That's very strange.

01:06:40.785 --> 01:06:44.728
MATT: I'll go first! I just want to see, I'm
really interested.

01:06:44.728 --> 01:06:47.169
SAM: But you said we could be light sensitive.

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:53.556
MATT: I have a good mind for these things, and you
know what? My intuition's telling me that I go first.

01:06:53.556 --> 01:06:55.698
LAURA: You're acting really weird, Matt.

01:06:55.698 --> 01:07:03.019
TALIESIN: He gets just far enough to grab his hand
onto the curtain, and a beam of daylight comes

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:07.271
streaking right through and hits you square in the
head.

01:07:07.271 --> 01:07:09.003
MATT: Shit.

01:07:09.003 --> 01:07:13.745
SAM: Does he cry out in pain or anything?

01:07:13.745 --> 01:07:15.500
TALIESIN: He doesn't cry out. No, nothing happens.

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.855
LAURA: Does it hurt?

01:07:17.855 --> 01:07:20.449
MATT: Am I fine? Does it hurt me?

01:07:20.449 --> 01:07:23.772
TALIESIN: Slowly, the two halves of you separate
at the head.

01:07:23.772 --> 01:07:26.338
SAM: I pull him back!

01:07:26.338 --> 01:07:30.550
LAURA: I'm going to squish his halves together and
hold him together!

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:32.837
TALIESIN: And Matt Mercer drops into a pile of
ash.

01:07:32.837 --> 01:07:39.398
(shouting)

01:07:39.398 --> 01:07:41.790
MARISHA: We always knew you'd be the first to go
in the apocalypse.

01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:43.268
LAURA: You're dead already?

01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:45.666
TRAVIS: He's literally a pile of ash? Clothes,
anything, just ash?

01:07:45.666 --> 01:07:46.903
TALIESIN: Just ash.

01:07:46.903 --> 01:07:48.555
TRAVIS: (shouting) Pick up the ashes!

01:07:48.555 --> 01:07:50.746
SAM: I'm picking up the ashes.

01:07:50.746 --> 01:07:53.025
LAURA: (shouting) Marisha's going to be so upset!

01:07:53.025 --> 01:07:54.597
SAM: I don't know what to do, I'm putting them in
our pockets!

01:07:54.597 --> 01:07:56.428
LIAM: Why are you always the one who picks up the
ashes?

01:07:56.428 --> 01:08:00.827
TALIESIN: Marisha, there is nothing funny about
this. You shouldn't be laughing.

01:08:00.827 --> 01:08:02.610
TRAVIS: She's not out here!

01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:06.918
MARISHA: I'm not there! I'm in the office!

01:08:06.918 --> 01:08:09.740
TALIESIN: You're not there? Oh shit. Well you
certainly are hearing screaming now.

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:11.046
SAM: I start crying.

01:08:11.046 --> 01:08:13.190
LIAM: I'm with Marisha in the office.

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:14.749
LAURA: We're crying.

01:08:14.749 --> 01:08:16.945
TRAVIS: No, I'm not crying, I'm freaking the fuck
out!

01:08:16.945 --> 01:08:19.927
TALIESIN: You are having the best creative meeting
ever, by the way.

01:08:19.927 --> 01:08:22.886
MARISHA: This is a great creative meeting. I kind
of miss this.

01:08:22.886 --> 01:08:26.666
SAM: Oh god! What are we going to do? Should we
tell Marisha?

01:08:26.666 --> 01:08:30.230
TRAVIS: No! Yes! No!

01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:31.853
SAM: I think we're alone.

01:08:31.853 --> 01:08:33.753
TRAVIS: I'm out there with you, I'm by the
server.

01:08:33.753 --> 01:08:36.137
LAURA: If he was by the server room he totally
would've seen it happen.

01:08:36.137 --> 01:08:37.822
SAM: We can't tell Marisha, they were about to get
married!

01:08:37.822 --> 01:08:41.428
LIAM: Meanwhile, back in the office: This is why I
never get in the middle of G&amp;amp;S conversations,

01:08:41.428 --> 01:08:46.108
because you guys have your own language. I never
know what you're talking about, and it's best that

01:08:46.108 --> 01:08:47.827
I just stay out of your way.

01:08:47.827 --> 01:08:50.505
TRAVIS: Do we bring the ashes with us or do we
like put them in a trash bin?

01:08:50.505 --> 01:08:58.950
MATT: It's not just ashes. Amongst the pile, there
is still a foam sword and a Power Ranger helmet.

01:08:58.950 --> 01:09:01.948
This is important guys, don't leave that behind.

01:09:01.948 --> 01:09:04.109
LAURA: I pick up the Power Ranger helmet.

01:09:04.109 --> 01:09:05.447
TALIESIN: It's not going to help you.

01:09:05.447 --> 01:09:07.692
LAURA: Can we put the ashes in the Power Ranger
helmet?

01:09:07.692 --> 01:09:08.969
TALIESIN: You can.

01:09:08.969 --> 01:09:11.030
MARISHA: Oh my god, that's so sad!

01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:14.775
SAM: I'll pile the ashes in the helmet.

01:09:14.775 --> 01:09:18.850
TRAVIS: We don't tell Marisha! She'll freak out.
Maybe there's a way to undo it.

01:09:18.850 --> 01:09:21.919
LAURA: To bring his ashes back?

01:09:21.919 --> 01:09:26.388
SAM: No, if we break the magic, everything comes
back to normal. That's how these things work.

01:09:26.388 --> 01:09:30.087
LAURA: What, do you think this is magic? You don't
think we're actually fucking vampires right now?

01:09:30.087 --> 01:09:31.462
TRAVIS: Did you eat a rat a second ago?

01:09:31.462 --> 01:09:36.763
LAURA: I ate a rat! I feel like this is real life!
It's not going to go back.

01:09:36.763 --> 01:09:44.972
TALIESIN: You hear thunderous sounds of something
being tossed around really violently upstairs,

01:09:44.972 --> 01:09:53.522
like somebody is doing demolition up there and
then it suddenly stops. You can see, from your

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:58.660
vantage point, everyone in the front office of
Geek &amp;amp; Sundry looks up. And then goes right back

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:01.365
to work, like trying to pretend that nothing
happened.

01:10:01.365 --> 01:10:02.526
MARISHA: I pop out of the office--

01:10:02.526 --> 01:10:06.557
TALIESIN: You do not get that far. Do you try and
stand up?

01:10:06.557 --> 01:10:11.904
MARISHA: Yeah? I was going to go talk to Dani.

01:10:11.904 --> 01:10:13.234
LAURA: Oh no, you drank the tea.

01:10:13.234 --> 01:10:16.513
TALIESIN: Yeah. What did we learn about drinking
the tea?

01:10:16.513 --> 01:10:20.409
MARISHA: You know, it looked real good. You said
it looked bloody. I'm real thirsty.

01:10:20.409 --> 01:10:25.696
TALIESIN: I will also say: while it is not sun
tea, it is Sean tea.

01:10:25.696 --> 01:10:30.787
MARISHA: Ashanti about a Sean tea?.

01:10:30.787 --> 01:10:32.557
LAURA: It's made of Sean?

01:10:32.557 --> 01:10:35.205
TALIESIN: It is made of Sean.

01:10:35.205 --> 01:10:36.996
MARISHA: Wait, you mean it's &lt;i&gt;Sean&lt;/i&gt; tea?

01:10:36.996 --> 01:10:50.070
TALIESIN: With a hint of mushroom for flavor. As
you go to stand up from the grass, you notice that--

01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:54.322
MARISHA: (shouting) I'm drinking my best friend's
essence! That's gross!

01:10:54.322 --> 01:11:01.548
TALIESIN: Your legs have turned into little
mushrooms in the grass. And they're starting to

01:11:01.548 --> 01:11:04.760
push through your abdomen as well, and come up
through your throat.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:11.714
LIAM: No! I'm going to start scraping them off, if
I can.

01:11:11.714 --> 01:11:21.806
TALIESIN: Make a stanima-- a stanima roll.

01:11:21.806 --> 01:11:25.026
LIAM: Okay. Just straight, right?

01:11:25.026 --> 01:11:28.610
TALIESIN: Just kind of a simple one.

01:11:28.610 --> 01:11:33.991
LIAM: That's a failure on the red. No it's not,
it's a five, and ones are the only failure.

01:11:33.991 --> 01:11:36.051
TALIESIN: Ones are the only fail. There's a big X
when you go wrong.

01:11:36.051 --> 01:11:37.376
LIAM: So one success.

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:43.677
TALIESIN: The stuff starts sticking to you in a
way that you don't like, and it burns a little

01:11:43.677 --> 01:11:48.429
bit. You probably want to wipe your hands off. And
while you were wiping her off, it was starting to

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:51.229
go straight through the skin like there was
nothing under there other than mushrooms.

01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:55.964
MARISHA: It's just something I ate. Mushrooms have
never sat well with me.

01:11:55.964 --> 01:11:58.298
TALIESIN: And that's the last thing Marisha ever
said.

01:11:58.298 --> 01:12:01.380
(shouting)

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:02.794
LIAM: (shouting) No!

01:12:02.794 --> 01:12:07.676
LAURA: We come barging in: (crying) You guys!

01:12:07.676 --> 01:12:09.920
SAM: (crying) Marisha, I'm so sorry! He's gone!

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:12.242
TRAVIS: What'd you do?

01:12:12.242 --> 01:12:14.121
LIAM: She's a mushroom.

01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:15.205
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

01:12:15.205 --> 01:12:18.972
LIAM: She's a mushroom, look! And I push into her
shoulder.

01:12:18.972 --> 01:12:22.077
TALIESIN: She leans right over and you've got
powder on your hand.

01:12:22.077 --> 01:12:25.244
(shouting)

01:12:25.244 --> 01:12:33.682
TRAVIS: Oh fuck! What happened? We took care of
the guy we were with. What'd you do?

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:34.926
LIAM: Where's Matt?

01:12:34.926 --> 01:12:36.807
LAURA: (shouting) He's in the Power Rangers
helmet!

01:12:36.807 --> 01:12:40.202
(shouting)

01:12:40.202 --> 01:12:48.294
TALIESIN: Suddenly, Christian bursts into the
room. He is covered in blood and says, "Can you

01:12:48.294 --> 01:12:49.797
"keep it down?"

01:12:49.797 --> 01:12:51.104
TRAVIS: Does he smell good?

01:12:51.104 --> 01:12:58.105
TALIESIN: He does. "You guys are making a lot of
noise, and people are trying to work. God!" And he

01:12:58.105 --> 01:12:59.603
goes back out.

01:12:59.603 --> 01:13:07.185
LAURA: I'm going to set Matt's helmet down next to
Marisha's mushroom head.

01:13:07.185 --> 01:13:10.622
TRAVIS: Okay. Not sure what's happening? Sun: bad.
Sun very bad.

01:13:10.622 --> 01:13:12.938
SAM: Don't go out the front door. Don't drink
anything.

01:13:12.938 --> 01:13:14.968
LIAM: Don't drink the tea! She drank the tea!

01:13:14.968 --> 01:13:20.832
SAM: Do we get a refund on the wedding gift?

01:13:20.832 --> 01:13:26.285
LIAM: I literally just bought a new suit. It's a
good suit.

01:13:26.285 --> 01:13:29.786
SAM: Is it an automatic refund thing, or do we
have to apply for it?

01:13:29.786 --> 01:13:31.925
MARISHA: (whispering) Take my safety deposit!

01:13:31.925 --> 01:13:38.287
TRAVIS: Can I look at Dani? Dani, why are you
wearing a sign that says "Drink me"?

01:13:38.287 --> 01:13:40.068
TALIESIN: Actually, Dani's one of the few who
isn't.

01:13:40.068 --> 01:13:45.733
TRAVIS: Not wearing a sign. Chris is. Why are you
wearing a sign that says "Drink me?"

01:13:45.733 --> 01:13:48.293
TALIESIN: "He said I had to. I'm sorry, I
can't--"

01:13:48.293 --> 01:13:50.013
TRAVIS: Father said you had to?

01:13:50.013 --> 01:13:53.052
TALIESIN: He's not in a mood to talk.

01:13:53.052 --> 01:13:54.956
SAM: Is Father Chris Hardwick?

01:13:54.956 --> 01:13:58.468
TRAVIS: We should kill Chris.

01:13:58.468 --> 01:13:59.698
SAM: Hardwick?

01:13:59.698 --> 01:14:02.136
TRAVIS: Nope. This Chris.

01:14:02.136 --> 01:14:03.422
LAURA: Why?

01:14:03.422 --> 01:14:08.055
TRAVIS: Chris, do you want me to kill you? We
shouldn't kill Chris.

01:14:08.055 --> 01:14:14.100
TALIESIN: He does smell-- Well, no, you're at one.
You're fine.

01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:19.498
LIAM: Hey, just a side note. For their wedding, I
bought them a big block of tickets to Hamilton,

01:14:19.498 --> 01:14:21.053
and they can't use them now.

01:14:21.053 --> 01:14:22.608
TRAVIS: The wedding's done, Liam!

01:14:22.608 --> 01:14:25.422
LIAM: I get that. Would you like to see Hamilton
again?

01:14:25.422 --> 01:14:33.450
TALIESIN: Suddenly the creative room stops. All
eyes turn to Liam.

01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:38.645
LIAM: I mean, if anyone wants to buy them off me,
I'll cut you a real good deal.

01:14:38.645 --> 01:14:41.136
TALIESIN: And they slowly start to get up.

01:14:41.136 --> 01:14:42.515
LIAM: Wait, what's going on?

01:14:42.515 --> 01:14:44.707
TALIESIN: "You have Hamilton tickets?"

01:14:44.707 --> 01:14:54.064
LIAM: I mean, not on me! But I could never tell
you where they are if I'm eaten!

01:14:54.064 --> 01:15:01.078
TALIESIN: Whitney and Eric slowly move towards
you, and as they open their mouths a little wider,

01:15:01.078 --> 01:15:06.053
you see that there is nothing in there. It's just
a void in their mouths.

01:15:06.053 --> 01:15:08.864
SAM: I'm going to whip Whitney in the face with an
XLR cable!

01:15:08.864 --> 01:15:14.553
TALIESIN: Let's do dexterity with brawl.

01:15:14.553 --> 01:15:22.270
SAM: All successes. Three successes!

01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:34.098
TALIESIN: Three successes? You get her right in
the face. She falls down with a big cut right

01:15:34.098 --> 01:15:40.959
across her face. This black dust comes poofing out
of it like soot. She's giggling on the floor,

01:15:40.959 --> 01:15:48.700
rolling around in laughter. The whole room starts
to bend, glitter, and shift. Everything's getting

01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:53.765
a little soft in there. Maybe you've been
breathing too many of the spores.

01:15:53.765 --> 01:15:58.859
SAM: Like I feel like I'm seeing trails?

01:15:58.859 --> 01:16:01.644
TALIESIN: How do you feel like you're seeing
things? You're either seeing something or you're

01:16:01.644 --> 01:16:04.045
not. If you're seeing it, it's either real or it
isn't.

01:16:04.045 --> 01:16:05.268
SAM: Does it feel good?

01:16:05.268 --> 01:16:13.183
TALIESIN: It doesn't feel good. It feels like
things are going to turn on you at any second.

01:16:13.183 --> 01:16:16.833
SAM: I'm going to back up, cock my XLR cable.

01:16:16.833 --> 01:16:19.439
LAURA: We should shut the door. I'm going to shut
the office door.

01:16:19.439 --> 01:16:21.497
TRAVIS: We got to get Liam out of there!

01:16:21.497 --> 01:16:23.155
LAURA: Liam's in there still?

01:16:23.155 --> 01:16:25.824
TALIESIN: It's up to you if you backed up with
everybody.

01:16:25.824 --> 01:16:28.012
LIAM: Wherever Sam is, I am now.

01:16:28.012 --> 01:16:30.972
TRAVIS: I kick Eric dead in the chest just for good
measure.

01:16:30.972 --> 01:16:35.523
MATT: Just for good measure.

01:16:35.523 --> 01:16:37.858
TRAVIS: He was coming after Liam!

01:16:37.858 --> 01:16:38.907
LIAM: He's big!

01:16:38.907 --> 01:16:40.484
TALIESIN: Strength brawl.

01:16:40.484 --> 01:16:42.643
TRAVIS: Just strength?

01:16:42.643 --> 01:16:51.382
TALIESIN: Strength brawl. Get weird. What's your
power again? Okay, never mind. I know what your

01:16:51.382 --> 01:16:52.851
power is.

01:16:52.851 --> 01:16:55.757
SAM: Matt and Marisha!

01:16:55.757 --> 01:16:57.441
LAURA: You guys are so dead!

01:16:57.441 --> 01:17:01.151
TRAVIS: Six successes, no failures.

01:17:01.151 --> 01:17:09.090
TALIESIN: Six successes, no fails? Your foot goes
right through the center of him in a big poof of soot.

01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:11.622
TRAVIS: (coughing) I back out.

01:17:11.622 --> 01:17:18.102
TALIESIN: When you pull out, he is again on the
ground hiccuping in a laugh and the shoe you were

01:17:18.102 --> 01:17:22.123
wearing is now a different shoe than you have on
your other foot.

01:17:22.123 --> 01:17:26.830
TRAVIS: My shoe changed. I kicked him in the chest
and my shoe changed.

01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:28.110
SAM: Is it a Jordan?

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:33.340
TALIESIN: It's not a nice shoe. It's definitely a
Ross Men's For Less shoe.

01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:39.508
LIAM: Do Laura and I also see a changed shoe? We
all see a changed shoe?

01:17:39.508 --> 01:17:42.906
LAURA: Why did his shoe change? Travis, get out of
the fucking room!

01:17:42.906 --> 01:17:44.350
LIAM: Is that your vampire power?

01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:46.750
TRAVIS: I got out of it, though! His chest gives
you new shoes!

01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:53.006
LAURA: I'm shutting the door now and I'm grabbing
a chair and I'm putting it in the thing to block the

01:17:53.006 --> 01:17:55.080
office.

01:17:55.126 --> 01:17:57.483
TALIESIN: Dani's looking at all of you.

01:17:57.483 --> 01:17:59.758
TRAVIS: Is she still sitting down?

01:17:59.758 --> 01:18:00.678
TALIESIN: She is.

01:18:00.678 --> 01:18:01.706
LAURA: Dani, this is messed up.

01:18:01.706 --> 01:18:02.713
TALIESIN: "I agree."

01:18:02.713 --> 01:18:03.904
LAURA: Matt and Marisha are dead.

01:18:03.904 --> 01:18:04.998
TALIESIN: "Yes, I know."

01:18:04.998 --> 01:18:06.305
TRAVIS: Dani, show me your hands!

01:18:06.305 --> 01:18:08.372
TALIESIN: "Jazz hands."

01:18:08.372 --> 01:18:12.635
LIAM: Open your mouth. Can I see anything? Is
there a void?

01:18:12.635 --> 01:18:16.720
TALIESIN: Not at the moment. Her eyes do have the
weird little mold. There's a little bit of the

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:20.627
mold, the closer you look, the lips and eyes,
little bit of the gray mold going on.

01:18:20.627 --> 01:18:22.243
LAURA: Dani, did you eat mushrooms?

01:18:22.243 --> 01:18:24.308
TALIESIN: "No."

01:18:24.308 --> 01:18:26.933
SAM: Can't kill anyone! I just whipped somebody in
the face and they laughed!

01:18:26.933 --> 01:18:30.180
TRAVIS: Yeah, I kicked Eric's chest out and he
started laughing.

01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:33.119
TALIESIN: Dani goes into her desk and she pulls
out a key card for you all.

01:18:33.119 --> 01:18:34.822
LAURA: Thanks. What is this for?

01:18:34.822 --> 01:18:42.432
TALIESIN: And a little wooden stake. She's like,
"You should probably get going, there's a lot of

01:18:42.432 --> 01:18:47.526
"work to do if you're going to make it to the
Twitch show on time." She goes back to working on

01:18:47.526 --> 01:18:49.154
her unpowered laptop.

01:18:49.154 --> 01:18:52.820
TRAVIS: Unpowered laptop. Just black screen?

01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:54.970
TALIESIN: Everybody's is black screens.

01:18:54.970 --> 01:18:56.563
TRAVIS: She's typing furiously?

01:18:56.563 --> 01:18:58.030
TALIESIN: Everybody's typing on nothing.

01:18:58.030 --> 01:19:00.534
LAURA: This is really weird, you guys.

01:19:00.534 --> 01:19:04.430
TRAVIS: Hey. Should we bring one of these "Drink
Me" guys with us?

01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:05.447
LAURA: Why?

01:19:05.447 --> 01:19:06.673
TRAVIS: I don't know.

01:19:06.673 --> 01:19:10.941
SAM: In case we want to drink them? Or feed them
to somebody else?

01:19:10.941 --> 01:19:12.751
TRAVIS: Like a decoy. No offense, Chris.

01:19:12.751 --> 01:19:15.965
LIAM: We hit them, they fucked with our brains.

01:19:15.965 --> 01:19:17.891
LAURA: Not the "Drink Me" ones.

01:19:17.891 --> 01:19:22.583
TALIESIN: They don't have as much of the-- they're
still there, they're not giggling.

01:19:22.583 --> 01:19:24.242
TRAVIS: Chris, do you want to come with us?

01:19:24.242 --> 01:19:25.500
TALIESIN: "No."

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:26.485
LAURA: What about you, Arcade?

01:19:26.485 --> 01:19:28.026
LIAM: Yeah, Arcade, are you good?

01:19:28.026 --> 01:19:35.775
TALIESIN: Arcade's trying to not even look at you
guys. There's another huge thump above from the

01:19:35.775 --> 01:19:40.864
offices above and the sounds of knives scraping
into walls and glass.

01:19:40.864 --> 01:19:43.389
SAM: I'm going to try to glamor him.

01:19:43.389 --> 01:19:45.747
LAURA: You can do that?

01:19:45.747 --> 01:19:47.540
TALIESIN: What power do you have right now?

01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:52.613
SAM: Power? I don't have power; I'm going to try
to convince him with the power of my words.

01:19:52.613 --> 01:19:57.805
LAURA: You're not Scanlan, you're a vampire.

01:19:57.805 --> 01:20:00.700
TRAVIS: You don't know that. We're all a bit of
our characters.

01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:07.927
SAM: Going to say: you need to come with us right
now. You cannot resist. The power of Christ

01:20:07.927 --> 01:20:09.064
compels you.

01:20:09.064 --> 01:20:11.310
(laughter)

01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:19.718
TRAVIS: He burns. Bursts into flame. (yelling) Oh
god, he rolled something.

01:20:19.718 --> 01:20:21.132
SAM: I watched True Blood.

01:20:21.132 --> 01:20:31.727
TALIESIN: Something feels weird, but it doesn't
quite work right. You don't know what you felt,

01:20:31.727 --> 01:20:33.158
but you felt a little vibration.

01:20:33.158 --> 01:20:35.084
SAM: A good vibration?

01:20:35.084 --> 01:20:36.077
TALIESIN: &lt;i&gt;Good&lt;/i&gt; vibration.

01:20:36.077 --> 01:20:38.493
TRAVIS: (singing) It's a good vibration!

01:20:38.493 --> 01:20:42.936
SAM: You can feel it! It felt good?

01:20:42.936 --> 01:20:46.025
TALIESIN: Yeah, you felt a little twitch.

01:20:46.025 --> 01:20:52.021
SAM: Then I'm going to do it again. I'm going to
yell at him. You're nothing without us! We keep the

01:20:52.021 --> 01:20:54.067
lights on in this place! Come with us!

01:20:54.067 --> 01:21:00.827
TALIESIN: He looks afraid, but he's cowering a
little bit.

01:21:00.827 --> 01:21:02.583
LAURA: Sam, be nice to him, he's a really cool
guy.

01:21:02.583 --> 01:21:04.336
SAM: I don't know what I'm doing.

01:21:04.336 --> 01:21:07.359
LAURA: I'm going to go over to Arcade and put my
hand on his shoulder.

01:21:07.359 --> 01:21:16.502
TALIESIN: What am I going to do? Roll a d10.

01:21:16.502 --> 01:21:18.451
LAURA: Just 1d10?

01:21:18.451 --> 01:21:19.562
TALIESIN: How many red do you have right now?

01:21:19.562 --> 01:21:20.561
LAURA: Just one.

01:21:20.561 --> 01:21:21.650
TALIESIN: Roll a d10.

01:21:21.650 --> 01:21:26.191
LAURA: Ooh. I rolled a three. So close.

01:21:26.191 --> 01:21:30.567
TALIESIN: You have a moment when you touch him
where you really think about tearing right into that

01:21:30.567 --> 01:21:34.490
throat. Your fangs start to grow.

01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:40.736
LIAM: You all right, La? Why are you--?

01:21:40.736 --> 01:21:43.708
LAURA: Arcade looks really good is all.

01:21:43.708 --> 01:21:45.511
LIAM: You need chapstick?

01:21:45.511 --> 01:21:48.979
LAURA: Do you want to come with us?

01:21:48.979 --> 01:21:57.606
TRAVIS: Which teeth began to grow? The buck teeth
or the canines?

01:21:57.606 --> 01:22:00.277
TALIESIN: Bit of both.

01:22:00.277 --> 01:22:05.261
LAURA: Upstairs, maybe? Are we going to the Twitch
set? I don't know. What's happening upstairs?

01:22:05.261 --> 01:22:06.986
TALIESIN: "You don't want to go upstairs."

01:22:06.986 --> 01:22:09.892
TRAVIS: We should go to the Twitch set.

01:22:09.892 --> 01:22:14.675
LAURA: Let's go to the Twitch set. Come on, let's
go. It'll be so much fun. Come on.

01:22:14.675 --> 01:22:16.813
TALIESIN: You can try and drag him.

01:22:16.813 --> 01:22:20.687
LAURA: You want to go to the Twitch set?

01:22:20.687 --> 01:22:22.033
TALIESIN: "I want to stay here."

01:22:22.033 --> 01:22:24.069
TRAVIS: Fine, we'll leave him.

01:22:24.069 --> 01:22:25.563
LIAM: I'm pulling Sam away for a minute.

01:22:25.563 --> 01:22:26.894
SAM: What?

01:22:26.894 --> 01:22:32.142
LIAM: Whispering. Listen to me. Those guys, I love
them, but they're married and--

01:22:32.142 --> 01:22:33.943
SAM: Who's married? Oh, Laura.

01:22:33.943 --> 01:22:35.520
LAURA: Baby! Look at my teeth!

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:37.652
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

01:22:37.652 --> 01:22:38.604
LAURA: I know!

01:22:38.604 --> 01:22:39.436
SAM: What are you saying?

01:22:39.436 --> 01:22:40.759
LIAM: I'm saying that you and me.

01:22:40.759 --> 01:22:43.278
SAM: An alliance?

01:22:43.278 --> 01:22:49.407
LIAM: You are my best friend! They are my best
friends, but they're married!

01:22:49.407 --> 01:22:52.907
TRAVIS: I'll actually use my heightened senses.

01:22:52.907 --> 01:22:55.766
TALIESIN: What's the roll for that?

01:22:55.766 --> 01:22:58.840
TRAVIS: I see hunger roll is perception plus
investigation.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:01.015
LIAM: They &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to help each other!

01:23:01.015 --> 01:23:03.486
SAM: Okay, if shit goes down, I'll help you.

01:23:03.486 --> 01:23:05.813
TRAVIS: Liam's whispering and Sam's talking in a
normal voice.

01:23:05.813 --> 01:23:09.469
TALIESIN: To be fair, I'm going to let you have
this. You can hear all of this.

01:23:09.469 --> 01:23:13.825
LIAM: I'm just saying if things go pear-shaped, I
got you.

01:23:13.825 --> 01:23:17.432
TRAVIS: They're saying if things go pear-shaped,
they're going to fuck us and take care of each

01:23:17.432 --> 01:23:18.488
other.

01:23:18.488 --> 01:23:19.687
LAURA: You dicks!

01:23:19.687 --> 01:23:22.508
SAM: No, we didn't say that! We said that we would
look out for each other.

01:23:22.508 --> 01:23:23.818
TALIESIN: Travis, I have a gift for you.

01:23:23.818 --> 01:23:29.379
LAURA: Oh, you're hungry! You're getting hungrier!
We should get out of this room.

01:23:29.379 --> 01:23:40.097
SAM: What do we know? There's some sort of Twitch
performance that we have to get to. There's a

01:23:40.097 --> 01:23:46.326
Twitch show, there's something upstairs, there's
weird shit on the walls being written. Do we know

01:23:46.326 --> 01:23:47.286
what that is?

01:23:47.286 --> 01:23:48.671
LAURA: We definitely can't leave.

01:23:48.671 --> 01:23:49.874
TALIESIN: Not until the sun sets.

01:23:49.874 --> 01:23:51.306
MATT: (gasps)

01:23:51.306 --> 01:23:52.660
SAM: Matt's dead.

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.268
LAURA: Marisha's dead.

01:23:54.268 --> 01:23:55.751
SAM: Marisha's a spore.

01:23:55.751 --> 01:23:56.998
LAURA: We don't know where Taliesin is.

01:23:56.998 --> 01:23:58.771
LIAM: The wedding is probably not happening.

01:23:58.771 --> 01:24:03.286
LAURA: We would be doing so well if Taliesin was
here. He would totally know what to do right now.

01:24:03.286 --> 01:24:08.070
MARISHA: The wedding is probably not happening
after those two conclusions!

01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:11.924
TALIESIN: Dust and mushrooms. We are marrying dust
and mushrooms.

01:24:11.924 --> 01:24:16.304
TRAVIS: We've been to the front door, we've been
to the bullpen, we've been to the server room.

01:24:16.304 --> 01:24:18.071
LAURA: We got to go to the Twitch stage.

01:24:18.071 --> 01:24:19.639
TRAVIS: And there's that area beyond the Twitch
stage that I never go into.

01:24:19.639 --> 01:24:22.563
LAURA: Oh yeah, the back area! Let's make our way
to the Twitch area.

01:24:22.563 --> 01:24:25.777
SAM: Yeah, let's go! Liam!

01:24:25.777 --> 01:24:26.976
LIAM: What's up, yes?

01:24:26.976 --> 01:24:28.188
SAM: We're going to the Twitch area!

01:24:28.188 --> 01:24:36.897
TALIESIN: In a little while, when we come back, we
will be going to the Twitch area. You guys are

01:24:36.897 --> 01:24:37.919
adorable.

01:24:37.919 --> 01:24:39.314
LAURA: What the heck is happening?

01:24:39.314 --> 01:24:44.668
TALIESIN: I'm having fun torturing you all. I've
got so many worse things to happen. Guys, thank

01:24:44.668 --> 01:24:51.022
you for enjoying my attempt to hang onto these
rules that I've written down. Things are going to

01:24:51.022 --> 01:24:54.784
get a little weirder because I'm going to inform
of them of a couple new rules that they can now

01:24:54.784 --> 01:24:59.931
play with since they're starting to vamp out a bit
more. Sadly, two of our party are dead and are

01:24:59.931 --> 01:25:02.621
going to have to not come back to the table.

01:25:02.621 --> 01:25:04.744
TRAVIS: You all died so fast!

01:25:04.744 --> 01:25:06.773
MATT: You know, I knew that was going to happen,
but when the compulsion kicked in I was like:

01:25:06.773 --> 01:25:08.098
Well, I rolled pretty high.

01:25:08.098 --> 01:25:12.707
TALIESIN: You rolled really high. I was going to
shove you out there because you are what you are.

01:25:12.707 --> 01:25:19.073
It's in an inside joke that probably 100 people
watching our stream right now are like, "Oh, I

01:25:19.073 --> 01:25:22.504
"know what Matt was." It was kind of cute.

01:25:22.504 --> 01:25:25.345
MATT: Lasombra.

01:25:25.345 --> 01:25:27.327
TALIESIN: Nothing you need to know about until
maybe next week. We'll talk about it.

01:25:27.327 --> 01:25:28.602
MATT: Well, thank you.

01:25:28.602 --> 01:25:31.926
TALIESIN: Guys, thank you so much. I think we're
going to have a giveaway for something in the

01:25:31.926 --> 01:25:41.132
chat and I believe we're going with "Bloodbath." I
hope you're enjoying this madness. It's going to

01:25:41.132 --> 01:25:48.144
get weirder and I hope you enjoy where we're going
with all this. We'll be back in a

01:25:48.144 --> 01:25:52.296
few minutes once we've watered or had other things
to drink. We'll see you soon.

01:25:52.296 --> 01:25:53.795
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:25:53.795 --> 01:25:56.572
MARISHA: Don't burn down the company while I'm
dead!

01:25:56.572 --> 01:47:32.640
[break]

01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:36.047
TALIESIN: Dude. I get the theming. I'm kind of--

01:47:36.047 --> 01:47:39.947
LAURA: I want to know where it's going.

01:47:39.947 --> 01:47:48.195
TALIESIN: Two nasty little children gone. Four
sweet little children left. The winner of our

01:47:48.195 --> 01:47:54.715
in-chat giveaway is Cloaked_roamer.

01:47:54.715 --> 01:47:56.829
TRAVIS: Cloaked_roamer!

01:47:56.829 --> 01:48:01.371
TALIESIN: Won a Wyrmwood set of ill-repute that
I'm not entirely sure of what it is or what it

01:48:01.371 --> 01:48:06.513
does, but it is a thing and I'm far too nervous
trying to run this game with all of these papers

01:48:06.513 --> 01:48:08.148
that I'm so glad you can't see--

01:48:08.148 --> 01:48:09.805
LIAM: And it wards off Christians.

01:48:09.805 --> 01:48:14.701
TALIESIN: It does apparently. Cloaked roamer? And
then I'm doing a little thing to help you guys out

01:48:14.701 --> 01:48:21.187
really quickly before we come back to the game. So
that I know what I'm doing because this is crazy.

01:48:21.187 --> 01:48:22.885
I hope you all are having a good time.

01:48:22.885 --> 01:48:24.245
LIAM: I am having a great time.

01:48:24.245 --> 01:48:28.363
SAM: This is a reasonably sized D&amp;amp;D table now. We
have a reasonable amount of people.

01:48:28.363 --> 01:48:32.510
LAURA: Yeah. There's plenty at the side-- I bumped
into you!

01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:34.778
LIAM: Let's put that over our head.

01:48:34.778 --> 01:48:41.310
TALIESIN: And just to remind you what's painted on
the floor when we get there.

01:48:41.310 --> 01:48:44.943
LAURA: Right. I marked that down.

01:48:44.943 --> 01:48:51.297
SAM: Did you guys hear this whole thing about the
clue? There's a riddle. Were you there for that or

01:48:51.297 --> 01:48:53.683
is that me hearing something that Marisha heard?

01:48:53.683 --> 01:48:55.298
TALIESIN: No, you've heard that.

01:48:55.298 --> 01:48:57.490
LIAM: Do you need this back?

01:48:57.490 --> 01:48:59.829
TALIESIN: No.

01:48:59.829 --> 01:49:04.794
LIAM: Here's a heart, sun, bottom left is face,
bottom right is a cross in a circle.

01:49:04.794 --> 01:49:07.420
LAURA: Oh, she gave us a--

01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:10.104
TALIESIN: A foam sword.

01:49:10.104 --> 01:49:14.812
LAURA: A foam sword. No, she gave us the wooden--

01:49:14.812 --> 01:49:18.116
TALIESIN and LIAM: A little wooden stake.

01:49:18.116 --> 01:49:22.655
TALIESIN: I think she may have given you a keycard
also. Because she was just--

01:49:22.655 --> 01:49:24.271
LAURA: She was being so kind.

01:49:24.271 --> 01:49:25.758
LIAM: And so much good role-playing.

01:49:25.758 --> 01:49:35.806
TALIESIN: I'm having fun in the most terrifying
way possible. Oh man, this is intense. I don't

01:49:35.806 --> 01:49:38.593
even know if this is a high, I'm not sure what
this is. This is jumping out of an airplane

01:49:38.593 --> 01:49:41.377
without a parachute, but knowing that it's foam
underneath.

01:49:41.377 --> 01:49:43.403
TRAVIS: Can we make our way back to the Twitch
stage?

01:49:43.403 --> 01:49:47.522
TALIESIN: So yeah, let's pick back up. For some
reason, my volume is--

01:49:47.522 --> 01:49:49.965
LIAM: (Snagglepuss voice) Oh, exit stage right,
even.

01:49:49.965 --> 01:49:52.410
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh no.

01:49:52.410 --> 01:49:58.353
TALIESIN: So you make your way back, quietly
through the mess.

01:49:58.353 --> 01:50:01.249
LAURA: Stealthily. We don't want to make noise
past the meat mass.

01:50:01.249 --> 01:50:02.653
TALIESIN: There we are.

01:50:02.653 --> 01:50:05.290
LIAM: (Snagglepuss voice) Heavens to Murgatroyd.

01:50:05.290 --> 01:50:12.351
TALIESIN: Jesus. I'm going to switch to another
one, see what happens. I don't know what any of

01:50:12.351 --> 01:50:14.992
these audio buttons do, so it's fun for
everybody.

01:50:14.992 --> 01:50:19.539
SAM: When I did my one-shot, I played the same
song for 45 minutes so it's just a two minute--

01:50:19.539 --> 01:50:23.289
LAURA: Hello?

01:50:23.289 --> 01:50:33.732
TALIESIN: I'm reeling it in. It's good. You know,
you could probably hear that from somewhere. We'll

01:50:33.732 --> 01:50:35.279
deal with that.

01:50:35.279 --> 01:50:36.844
TRAVIS: It's all upstairs.

01:50:36.844 --> 01:50:38.987
LIAM: It's probably Rachel Romero up from the
second floor.

01:50:38.987 --> 01:50:48.047
TALIESIN: Only I know. Don't think I don't have
plans. So you make your way. Do you want to go

01:50:48.047 --> 01:50:49.899
through the hallway or through the Nerdist
office?

01:50:49.899 --> 01:50:54.427
LAURA: No. Through the hallway. I feel like the
Nerdist office-- I just feel like it's going to be here.

01:50:54.427 --> 01:50:57.611
SAM: Guys, can I quickly admit that I don't know
the layout of the building at all?

01:50:57.611 --> 01:51:00.662
TRAVIS: Some people know this, actually.

01:51:00.662 --> 01:51:04.185
SAM: I don't know the difference between--

01:51:04.185 --> 01:51:10.489
TALIESIN: I have the blueprints to the whole
building right here. I know where every window is;

01:51:10.489 --> 01:51:12.090
I know where every office is.

01:51:12.090 --> 01:51:13.353
LAURA: And avoid the server room.

01:51:13.353 --> 01:51:15.082
SAM: Half the people you've talked about I've
never heard of.

01:51:15.082 --> 01:51:18.604
TRAVIS: Definitely the safest way back to the
Twitch stage is through the Nerdist office. Sam,

01:51:18.604 --> 01:51:19.679
you should lead us.

01:51:19.679 --> 01:51:23.510
SAM: Okay. Sure. Which way do I go?

01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:26.194
TRAVIS: Just right through this long passageway.

01:51:26.194 --> 01:51:28.556
SAM: Okay. I'm at the tip of the spear, I've got
my whip. I'm going.

01:51:28.556 --> 01:51:32.836
LAURA: I'm sure there's something heavy that I can
grab and use as a weapon in the Nerdist office.

01:51:32.836 --> 01:51:38.099
TALIESIN: Yeah. Make a perception investigation
roll.

01:51:38.099 --> 01:51:39.329
TRAVIS: Can I do the same?

01:51:39.329 --> 01:51:41.461
TALIESIN: Yeah. Anybody who wants to make
perception investigation roll.

01:51:41.461 --> 01:51:44.284
LAURA: Is it just perception?

01:51:44.284 --> 01:51:47.371
TALIESIN: Perception plus investigation, which is
right below it.

01:51:47.371 --> 01:51:49.523
TRAVIS: Oh, three successes.

01:51:49.523 --> 01:51:51.055
TALIESIN: That will do.

01:51:51.055 --> 01:51:55.775
LAURA: Oh god. I rolled a failure. On the red.

01:51:55.775 --> 01:51:58.999
TALIESIN: What's your hunger level?

01:51:58.999 --> 01:52:00.378
LAURA: This is the only one.

01:52:00.378 --> 01:52:01.737
TALIESIN: Just the only one?

01:52:01.737 --> 01:52:03.025
TRAVIS: Take a red die.

01:52:03.025 --> 01:52:11.570
TALIESIN: Not for one. You get distracted going
through people's stuff and you're going to get

01:52:11.570 --> 01:52:15.355
left a little behind. You'll be at the back of the
line by the time this is done.

01:52:15.355 --> 01:52:16.507
LAURA: Did I see anything?

01:52:16.507 --> 01:52:17.561
TRAVIS: Three successes.

01:52:17.561 --> 01:52:20.576
TALIESIN: Three successes? No, you didn't find
anything.

01:52:20.576 --> 01:52:21.762
LAURA: Nothing?

01:52:21.762 --> 01:52:23.351
TRAVIS: You got distracted, you're left behind.

01:52:23.351 --> 01:52:24.478
LAURA: Yeah, but--

01:52:24.478 --> 01:52:29.922
TALIESIN: You've found it. I'll tell you what you
did find. You found a Playstation VR system. But

01:52:29.922 --> 01:52:31.251
&lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; used.

01:52:31.251 --> 01:52:34.261
LIAM: You're getting pink eye from that.

01:52:34.261 --> 01:52:37.559
LAURA: Do you know how you get pink eye?

01:52:37.559 --> 01:52:42.823
TALIESIN: It was already a little iffy, but it's
definitely not been happy for the past however

01:52:42.823 --> 01:52:44.008
long it has been.

01:52:44.008 --> 01:52:45.363
LIAM: Poop in the eye, yeah?

01:52:45.363 --> 01:52:47.084
TALIESIN: Like Lucky Charms.

01:52:47.084 --> 01:52:49.756
LIAM: What's Travis doing right now?

01:52:49.756 --> 01:52:57.027
TALIESIN: He was wandering-- he went into the
corner, to Elise's desk and he found underneath

01:52:57.027 --> 01:53:05.079
her desk something that will do. It's a replica
knife that seems to be pretty solid. It's a Lord

01:53:05.079 --> 01:53:10.637
of the Rings replica elf knife. It's not exactly
sharp, but it will do the trick.

01:53:10.637 --> 01:53:16.473
LIAM: I catch up, put my hand on your shoulder.
That is sick. And I'm sorry and I use Presence:

01:53:16.473 --> 01:53:20.475
Awe to say, you really need to keep me safe so I
can get us out of here.

01:53:20.475 --> 01:53:21.786
TALIESIN: Oh, you're going for that?

01:53:21.786 --> 01:53:22.705
LIAM: Yes.

01:53:22.705 --> 01:53:24.100
TALIESIN: All right. Roll a d10.

01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:26.583
LIAM: Okay. Just one. So it's not charisma plus
persuasion?

01:53:26.583 --> 01:53:33.491
TALIESIN: We're doing that next. Roll a d10. Okay.
So what's your roll? I mean, what's your--

01:53:33.491 --> 01:53:37.409
LIAM: Charisma and persuasion.

01:53:37.409 --> 01:53:39.128
TALIESIN: And it's just straight-up?

01:53:39.128 --> 01:53:41.478
LIAM: That's what it says. Hunger or charisma plus
persuasion.

01:53:41.478 --> 01:53:44.001
TALIESIN: Let me double check just because I'm
learning how these powers work.

01:53:44.001 --> 01:53:46.789
SAM: Where are you?

01:53:46.789 --> 01:53:49.175
TALIESIN: I know. I'll find it.

01:53:49.175 --> 01:53:52.971
LAURA: I'm just playing with the Pink Eye system.

01:53:52.971 --> 01:53:56.158
LIAM: This is the scariest thing yet.

01:53:56.158 --> 01:54:02.143
SAM: Are you putting it on your face? It could
protect your eyes.

01:54:02.143 --> 01:54:03.743
TALIESIN: And what's your roll for that? Four?

01:54:03.743 --> 01:54:05.196
LIAM: I rolled a four on the d10.

01:54:05.196 --> 01:54:09.940
TALIESIN: Make a intelligence versus willpower
roll.

01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:11.770
TRAVIS: So what's the versus mean?

01:54:11.770 --> 01:54:14.724
TALIESIN: Oh. Just intelligence and willpower.

01:54:14.724 --> 01:54:19.144
LIAM: A single d10 or-- so I roll too? Charisma
plus persuasion?

01:54:19.144 --> 01:54:22.751
TALIESIN: Yeah, you roll that. Charisma plus
persuasion. I'm making this a versus because

01:54:22.751 --> 01:54:24.527
normally, it's not. But this is weird.

01:54:24.527 --> 01:54:39.241
TRAVIS: So this is the intelligence one. And
that's two successes and the willpower is two

01:54:39.241 --> 01:54:42.427
successes. And a failure, but not a red.

01:54:42.427 --> 01:54:43.970
LIAM: Two successes.

01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:46.995
TALIESIN: Two success. Do you want to burn a
willpower to reroll?

01:54:46.995 --> 01:54:48.022
LIAM: Yes.

01:54:48.022 --> 01:54:50.367
TALIESIN: Reroll everything you don't like and
burn a willpower.

01:54:50.367 --> 01:54:51.683
TRAVIS: It's four successes.

01:54:51.683 --> 01:54:53.174
LIAM: Five successes.

01:54:53.174 --> 01:54:56.573
SAM: Oh! You got to mark off that willpower.

01:54:56.573 --> 01:55:08.386
TALIESIN: He's your bro, man. And also, take an
extra die. You're here to keep everybody safe but you're--

01:55:08.386 --> 01:55:17.347
TRAVIS: Hey man. You are actually the person I'm
most concerned about, so you stay close to me. I'll

01:55:17.347 --> 01:55:18.709
keep you safe.

01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:25.516
LIAM: Everyone here, I don't know why, likes me.
I'm an idiot, but they do. So you keep me alive,

01:55:25.516 --> 01:55:28.517
obviously. So you keep &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; alive.

01:55:28.517 --> 01:55:30.477
TRAVIS: Look what I found!

01:55:30.477 --> 01:55:32.247
LAURA: I'm playing Resident Evil.

01:55:32.247 --> 01:55:33.437
TALIESIN: On the VR?

01:55:33.437 --> 01:55:34.451
LAURA: Yeah.

01:55:34.451 --> 01:55:36.583
TALIESIN: I think I was going to have you roll to
see if you get pink eye, but never mind.

01:55:36.583 --> 01:55:38.897
LIAM:That's an auto-fail.

01:55:38.897 --> 01:55:46.634
TALIESIN: I feel so bad, I'm so mean to Nerdist.
Nothing of event walking through here.

01:55:46.634 --> 01:55:47.827
TRAVIS: Through the Nerdist office? Nothing?

01:55:47.827 --> 01:55:49.049
TALIESIN: Nothing weird.

01:55:49.049 --> 01:55:51.584
TRAVIS: Let's go. Let's keep going. To the Twitch
stage.

01:55:51.584 --> 01:55:56.747
TALIESIN: You're at the door. There's the big
circle. You're in the kitchen again. There's the

01:55:56.747 --> 01:56:00.726
big circle on the floor and there's the bloody
sign on the big door.

01:56:00.726 --> 01:56:06.606
LAURA: Oh my god! The farmer jumped out! Oh, you
guys, have you played this? Oh my god, you guys!

01:56:06.606 --> 01:56:08.811
SAM: Is this a portable system? How does this
work?

01:56:08.811 --> 01:56:09.953
TALIESIN: No, it's--

01:56:09.953 --> 01:56:11.018
TRAVIS: Wired.

01:56:11.018 --> 01:56:14.966
LAURA: I already took it off, dick. And you're in
the kitchen.

01:56:14.966 --> 01:56:18.290
TALIESIN: The funniest thing of course is there's
prob-- well no, I guess there would be a little

01:56:18.290 --> 01:56:19.872
power to it. It's probably pretty glitchy.

01:56:19.872 --> 01:56:27.671
TRAVIS: It doesn't really work. None of the
laptops worked. You were playing with nothing.

01:56:27.671 --> 01:56:29.160
LAURA: I'm crazy!

01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:35.837
TALIESIN: So yeah, you get to the stage again and
big red letters that says, "I was born in a box.

01:56:35.837 --> 01:56:37.079
"How do I end?"

01:56:37.079 --> 01:56:40.470
TRAVIS: Okay, this is obviously some sort of
puzzle, right?

01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:46.346
SAM: This is a riddle, this is a puzzle. We've got
three clues so far. I was born in a box. How do I end?

01:56:46.346 --> 01:56:48.919
LIAM: Well, Matt ended and Marisha ended.

01:56:48.919 --> 01:56:52.089
SAM: Something is wrong. Right, that was the
first thing that we read.

01:56:52.089 --> 01:56:54.567
LAURA: Hey guys, thanks for leaving me behind in
the Nerdist--

01:56:54.567 --> 01:56:56.689
SAM: Is it something is the matter or something is
wrong?

01:56:56.689 --> 01:56:58.437
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Something is wrong.

01:56:58.437 --> 01:57:01.894
SAM: And then also, your funeral. This is a word
scramble.

01:57:01.894 --> 01:57:05.528
LAURA: Well, your funeral is obviously referring
to if you go through the curtain, you're dead.

01:57:05.528 --> 01:57:10.336
TALIESIN: Make an intelligence test. No, just
Sam.

01:57:10.336 --> 01:57:14.037
SAM: Okay. In just a straight--

01:57:14.037 --> 01:57:15.077
TALIESIN: Straight intelligence test.

01:57:15.077 --> 01:57:16.036
SAM: --straight stanima.

01:57:16.036 --> 01:57:20.636
TALIESIN: No, straight intelligence test, you
fucker. I have your stats here.

01:57:20.636 --> 01:57:22.460
SAM: Two successes.

01:57:22.460 --> 01:57:26.045
TALIESIN: Okay. You know me, I've been busy all
week. This is not a word scramble. I don't have

01:57:26.045 --> 01:57:27.651
time for that shit.

01:57:27.651 --> 01:57:29.525
TRAVIS: I would high-five you right now.

01:57:29.525 --> 01:57:30.701
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:57:30.701 --> 01:57:32.254
LAURA: I was born in a box. How do I end?

01:57:32.254 --> 01:57:35.132
TALIESIN: And there is a circle on the floor.

01:57:35.132 --> 01:57:36.880
LAURA: Oh, and it's got--

01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:40.181
TRAVIS: A heart, a sun, a face, a cross in a
circle.

01:57:40.181 --> 01:57:43.671
TALIESIN: Or a head, or a face.

01:57:43.671 --> 01:57:53.748
LAURA: How do I end? I was born in a box. How do I
end? You end from the sun! So I'm going to stand

01:57:53.748 --> 01:57:55.230
in the sun.

01:57:55.230 --> 01:57:56.789
SAM and LIAM: What?

01:57:56.789 --> 01:57:58.753
TRAVIS: In the circle or--

01:57:58.753 --> 01:58:00.877
TALIESIN: I followed you. Nothing happens.

01:58:00.877 --> 01:58:08.525
LAURA: Oh. Maybe the cross, too, a wooden
stake situation? Can't you die from a cross if

01:58:08.525 --> 01:58:09.531
you're a vampire?

01:58:09.531 --> 01:58:10.609
TRAVIS: If you're a vampire, yeah.

01:58:10.609 --> 01:58:12.689
LAURA: Aren't we vampires? Look at my teeth!

01:58:12.689 --> 01:58:14.584
TRAVIS: Those are a problem.

01:58:14.584 --> 01:58:16.483
SAM: Who gets born in a box?

01:58:16.483 --> 01:58:18.939
LAURA: We did! Coffins, dude.

01:58:18.939 --> 01:58:20.392
TRAVIS: Test-tube babies?

01:58:20.392 --> 01:58:24.150
TALIESIN: They were born from a tube. Sorry.

01:58:24.150 --> 01:58:27.780
SAM: Was Jesus Christ born in a box? A manger
thing?

01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:32.711
LAURA: No, &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; were born in a box.

01:58:32.711 --> 01:58:34.703
TALIESIN: How much you overestimate me.

01:58:34.703 --> 01:58:38.192
TRAVIS: When she stood in the sun, did anything
happen?

01:58:38.192 --> 01:58:39.291
TALIESIN: No.

01:58:39.291 --> 01:58:44.094
TRAVIS: Why don't you take the stake that we were
given and stab the heart with it?

01:58:44.094 --> 01:58:49.081
LAURA: Okay. I take the wooden stake and stab the
heart on the ground.

01:58:49.081 --> 01:58:54.324
TALIESIN: When you put the stake on the ground
by the heart, there's this low, bassy thud.

01:58:54.324 --> 01:59:00.937
LAURA: Should I leave it here or should I back
up? What should I do?

01:59:00.937 --> 01:59:03.257
SAM: That's a good thing. No, this is progress.

01:59:03.257 --> 01:59:05.111
LAURA: Should I leave it on the ground or should I--

01:59:05.111 --> 01:59:06.148
SAM: Sure.

01:59:06.148 --> 01:59:07.749
LAURA: I'll leave the stake on the ground.

01:59:07.749 --> 01:59:15.101
TALIESIN: The blood that the heart was drawn with
start to turn black and crackle. And it boils

01:59:15.101 --> 01:59:17.012
there, gently.

01:59:17.012 --> 01:59:21.855
TRAVIS: Okay. So heart and stake. Not cohesive.

01:59:21.855 --> 01:59:26.231
LAURA: Very cohesive. It killed the heart.

01:59:26.231 --> 01:59:28.386
TRAVIS and LAURA: Yeah.

01:59:28.386 --> 01:59:33.201
LAURA: Are there any more clues around? Do we see
any more writing?

01:59:33.201 --> 01:59:34.577
TALIESIN: This is a big building.

01:59:34.577 --> 01:59:35.698
TRAVIS: That's true.

01:59:35.698 --> 01:59:42.053
LIAM: All right. There's no people out here,
right? The "drink me" and "eat me" people were all

01:59:42.053 --> 01:59:44.937
back in the Nerdist offices, outside the
bullpen.

01:59:44.937 --> 01:59:46.738
TALIESIN: You don't see anybody.

01:59:46.738 --> 01:59:48.635
TRAVIS: Should we check the little prop closet?

01:59:48.635 --> 01:59:51.905
LAURA: Let's see if the key card opens the prop
closet. Did it work?

01:59:51.905 --> 01:59:57.636
TALIESIN: The keycard does in fact open the prop
closet. It's a very good keycard. That's better

01:59:57.636 --> 02:00:00.848
than my keycard. Yeah, the prop closet opens.

02:00:00.848 --> 02:00:02.393
LAURA: (gasps) Is there a weapon in here?

02:00:02.393 --> 02:00:03.664
TRAVIS: Can we turn the light on?

02:00:03.664 --> 02:00:05.486
TALIESIN: You can hit the switch.

02:00:05.486 --> 02:00:06.499
TRAVIS: I hit the switch.

02:00:06.499 --> 02:00:10.242
TALIESIN: Doesn't turn on. To be fair, you can see
okay. You don't see--

02:00:10.242 --> 02:00:13.405
TRAVIS: I do have heightened senses.

02:00:13.405 --> 02:00:17.952
TALIESIN: Especially if you want to burn a little
blood, you can see really well if you're looking

02:00:17.952 --> 02:00:28.649
for something in particular, but it's the prop
closet. It's a ruined, dishevelled mess of

02:00:28.649 --> 02:00:35.738
ephemera, toys, prop weapons, costumes. It's
exactly the way you remember it.

02:00:35.738 --> 02:00:38.045
TRAVIS: Do I smell anything coming from this
room?

02:00:38.045 --> 02:00:41.272
TALIESIN: Yes, but it is the same smell it's always
had, which has been very iffy.

02:00:41.272 --> 02:00:46.193
TRAVIS: Nothing tasty or spicy or interesting? I
mean, spicy is the wrong word. It's always spicy

02:00:46.193 --> 02:00:47.153
in there.

02:00:47.153 --> 02:00:49.568
TALIESIN: I don't know. It's whatever you really
imagine, the wonderful--

02:00:49.568 --> 02:00:51.993
TRAVIS: Does it smell delicious?

02:00:51.993 --> 02:00:55.343
TALIESIN: There's obviously some rats living in
here, if you went diving for them.

02:00:55.343 --> 02:01:01.333
LAURA: Can we look for rats? I need a rat. I want
to eat a rat again. It was really good.

02:01:01.333 --> 02:01:02.925
TALIESIN: It was pretty good.

02:01:02.925 --> 02:01:04.719
LAURA: I'm serious.

02:01:04.719 --> 02:01:06.160
SAM: All right. I'll try to look for a rat with
her.

02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:09.238
TALIESIN: All right. Do a perception
investigation.

02:01:09.238 --> 02:01:15.527
LIAM: Can I go back? I forgot something that I
wanted to do. Back at the office, inside the

02:01:15.527 --> 02:01:16.680
bullpen.

02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:18.644
TRAVIS: You guys are okay here looking for rats,
right? I'm going to go with Liam.

02:01:18.644 --> 02:01:20.157
TALIESIN: You can take a look.

02:01:20.157 --> 02:01:22.433
SAM: Only one success and one failure with the red
dice.

02:01:22.433 --> 02:01:25.852
TALIESIN: You find a rubber rat and you bite it.

02:01:25.852 --> 02:01:28.187
LAURA: Three successes for me.

02:01:28.187 --> 02:01:33.637
TALIESIN: I'm personally a fan of the taste of
rubber rats. I think it's nice and the texture's

02:01:33.637 --> 02:01:39.097
pretty positive but your tooth gets a little
weird. It doesn't feel right.

02:01:39.097 --> 02:01:40.685
LAURA: Three successes.

02:01:40.685 --> 02:01:48.920
TALIESIN: Three successes? Ooh, that's pretty
solid. You do in fact find a rat hiding behind one

02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:57.007
of the costume bins and if you want to tear for it,
you got to give me a dex melee or dex brawl. Roll

02:01:57.007 --> 02:01:58.220
for it.

02:01:58.220 --> 02:01:59.489
LAURA: I'll do a dex brawl.

02:01:59.489 --> 02:02:04.224
TALIESIN: All right. Punch that rat. Where are you
guys going?

02:02:04.224 --> 02:02:08.948
LIAM: I'm back at the office, outside the bullpen
where the door was shut. Who all's wearing

02:02:08.948 --> 02:02:11.173
these signs? It was Arcade--

02:02:11.173 --> 02:02:13.342
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Chris, Arcade.

02:02:13.342 --> 02:02:16.283
TALIESIN: Audrey was there. Max was there. A
couple of people.

02:02:16.283 --> 02:02:17.554
LAURA: Just one success.

02:02:17.554 --> 02:02:20.228
TALIESIN: It's a rat. I'll let you have it for
one.

02:02:20.228 --> 02:02:23.139
LAURA: Can I share it with Sam, though?

02:02:23.139 --> 02:02:24.751
TALIESIN: No.

02:02:24.751 --> 02:02:27.429
LAURA: I have to eat the rat all myself? Okay, I
eat the rat.

02:02:27.429 --> 02:02:28.876
TALIESIN: How many red dice do you have?

02:02:28.876 --> 02:02:29.955
LAURA: Just one.

02:02:29.955 --> 02:02:31.013
TALIESIN: It doesn't go away.

02:02:31.013 --> 02:02:32.706
LIAM: And the sign says what again?

02:02:32.706 --> 02:02:34.308
TALIESIN: Drink me.

02:02:34.308 --> 02:02:38.707
LAURA: I tried, I wanted to but it's such a little
rat. (slurps)

02:02:38.707 --> 02:02:42.731
SAM: I'd say you're dead to me, but--

02:02:42.731 --> 02:02:46.120
LIAM: Don't judge. I bite Arcade's neck.

02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:47.934
TRAVIS and LAURA: (gasping)

02:02:47.934 --> 02:02:49.625
TALIESIN: He's going to try and fight you off.

02:02:49.625 --> 02:02:52.464
LAURA: You're going to suck Arcade's blood?

02:02:52.464 --> 02:02:53.786
LIAM: I am.

02:02:53.786 --> 02:02:57.958
TALIESIN: He starts to panic and as it is
happening, he's going to fight you off.

02:02:57.958 --> 02:03:02.688
LIAM: I use Dread Gaze and inspire unbearable
immobility.

02:03:02.688 --> 02:03:05.208
TALIESIN: What's the roll on that?

02:03:05.208 --> 02:03:09.954
LIAM: Charisma plus intimidation versus charisma
and willpower.

02:03:09.954 --> 02:03:20.051
TALIESIN: All right. Give me charisma
intimidation. And my charisma willpower for my

02:03:20.051 --> 02:03:21.587
humans. There we are.

02:03:21.587 --> 02:03:31.084
LIAM: And failure is a one. So one success. No
failures.

02:03:31.084 --> 02:03:34.259
TALIESIN: He's not frozen. He's hiding in the
corner.

02:03:34.259 --> 02:03:38.209
LIAM: Okay. I grab a couple of t-shirts and I
push--

02:03:38.209 --> 02:03:39.457
TALIESIN: Which t-shirts?

02:03:39.457 --> 02:03:42.645
LIAM: The StayTurnt t-shirt and the Dungeon Master
t-shirt.

02:03:42.645 --> 02:03:43.914
TALIESIN: Thank you for being respectful.

02:03:43.914 --> 02:03:50.766
LIAM: And I cover his hands up and I say: Can you
just give into it? You know, this is terrible for

02:03:50.766 --> 02:03:51.850
both of us.

02:03:51.850 --> 02:03:53.623
TALIESIN: There's a single tear.

02:03:53.623 --> 02:03:55.495
LIAM: I know. But it will all be over soon.

02:03:55.495 --> 02:03:58.914
TRAVIS: I'm standing behind Liam, holding the prop
knife to the rest of the room. Is there anybody

02:03:58.914 --> 02:04:00.082
moving towards Liam?

02:04:00.082 --> 02:04:05.341
TALIESIN: No. I get the distinct impression this
has already happened. They know what's going down.

02:04:05.341 --> 02:04:08.999
LIAM: I mean, we're through the looking glass
here, Arcade. I'm really sorry, but I'm going to

02:04:08.999 --> 02:04:10.229
try to bite him again.

02:04:10.229 --> 02:04:12.851
TALIESIN: Are you going to go for a bite?

02:04:12.851 --> 02:04:13.678
LIAM: Yes, please.

02:04:13.678 --> 02:04:28.395
TALIESIN: Give me a strength brawl. Let me
double-check. Hold on. Actually, strength brawl

02:04:28.395 --> 02:04:29.731
plus two.

02:04:29.731 --> 02:04:37.597
LIAM: Strength brawl? Brawl's nothing. So strength
brawl plus two. Okay, it's not good. I got a fail!

02:04:37.597 --> 02:04:39.375
LAURA: You got two fails, yo!

02:04:39.375 --> 02:04:41.575
LIAM: Two fails! One on the red.

02:04:41.575 --> 02:04:49.839
TALIESIN: One on the red. He manages to just
barely fight you off. He's hidden under the desk

02:04:49.839 --> 02:04:51.183
now. He's trying to crawl away.

02:04:51.183 --> 02:04:52.219
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

02:04:52.219 --> 02:04:53.642
LIAM: Fuck it. I whip around and turn on Chris.

02:04:53.642 --> 02:04:59.246
TALIESIN: Give me a strength brawl plus two.

02:04:59.246 --> 02:05:00.887
TRAVIS: Are we eating people? What's happening?

02:05:00.887 --> 02:05:03.076
LAURA: He's giving in to it.

02:05:03.076 --> 02:05:05.667
LIAM: That's better. That's two successes.

02:05:05.667 --> 02:05:16.870
TALIESIN: All right. You get one point back. You
lose one. Do you want to go any further? Keep

02:05:16.870 --> 02:05:18.361
drinking or do you want to--

02:05:18.361 --> 02:05:20.167
LIAM: Yeah.

02:05:20.167 --> 02:05:22.778
LAURA: (gasps) You can't get rid of your other
one!

02:05:22.778 --> 02:05:24.098
LIAM: You can't get rid of the other one?

02:05:24.098 --> 02:05:26.128
TALIESIN: I'm sure there's a way to do it.

02:05:26.128 --> 02:05:33.432
LIAM: So you always keep one? If I'm okay-ish,
I'll hold off. I'll see you later, though.

02:05:33.432 --> 02:05:40.584
TALIESIN: He's now bleeding from the neck. As he
goes back to his-- not pouring, but bleeding.

02:05:40.584 --> 02:05:43.468
TRAVIS: Is there a little coagulant in Liam's
spit, at least?

02:05:43.468 --> 02:05:45.149
LIAM: But everybody likes me here, Travis.

02:05:45.149 --> 02:05:46.931
TRAVIS: I know they do.

02:05:46.931 --> 02:05:50.578
TALIESIN: Are you backing out of the room now to
join the rest?

02:05:50.578 --> 02:05:54.775
LIAM: Is there any other weapon-y stuff in the
room?

02:05:54.775 --> 02:05:56.501
TALIESIN: Not that you can see.

02:05:56.501 --> 02:05:58.405
LIAM: Is there anything ridiculous like--

02:05:58.405 --> 02:06:00.701
TALIESIN: You've seen that office. Everything's
ridiculous.

02:06:00.701 --> 02:06:04.749
LIAM: Yeah. All right.

02:06:04.749 --> 02:06:08.275
LAURA: I'm looking for a weapon in the prop closet
with the rats.

02:06:08.275 --> 02:06:11.535
SAM: I'm helping her and while we're looking I'm
telling her--

02:06:11.535 --> 02:06:15.515
TALIESIN: Perception investigation. You can
combine your roll if you like.

02:06:15.515 --> 02:06:18.268
LIAM: I swing past the office supplies and grab a
fistful of pencils.

02:06:18.268 --> 02:06:25.110
TALIESIN: Good call. Perception investigation. As
you walk by, you see Dani come walking through the

02:06:25.110 --> 02:06:33.713
office. She smiles, walks by. You see her go into
the office and she says, "Chris, we need you to

02:06:33.713 --> 02:06:39.833
"help update the server. Come on." And then she
walks by, carrying the bleeding Chris over to the

02:06:39.833 --> 02:06:41.088
server room.

02:06:41.088 --> 02:06:42.241
LAURA: What were you going to say, Sam?

02:06:42.241 --> 02:06:49.250
SAM: I'm was going to say, I'm feeling very
vulnerable. Why don't we form an alliance and if

02:06:49.250 --> 02:06:57.790
anything goes down, we kick Liam down and we'll
run away as fast as we can.

02:06:57.790 --> 02:06:59.912
LAURA: But we'll also make sure--

02:06:59.912 --> 02:07:02.559
TALIESIN: Sam, do you-- No. I'm just waving this.

02:07:02.559 --> 02:07:04.562
LIAM: You also have no idea that I just drained
Chris' neck.

02:07:04.562 --> 02:07:06.510
LAURA: We'll make sure Travis is okay.

02:07:06.510 --> 02:07:11.129
SAM: Of course. Yes. But Liam's a goner.

02:07:11.129 --> 02:07:23.640
LAURA: I mean, he's a pretty fast runner. I'm
probably the slowest out of all of us. I got two tens.

02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:32.074
TALIESIN: Two tens. That's a critical. That is a
critical. You have found some World of Warcraft

02:07:32.074 --> 02:07:38.055
prop swords. See, I did know where they were. I
did. There were right here. I know you're not

02:07:38.055 --> 02:07:44.685
watching, Marisha. I knew where they were. You
found some prop stakes, but to be fair, a prop

02:07:44.685 --> 02:07:48.150
stake is still a piece of wood. That's still
stake-y.

02:07:48.150 --> 02:07:49.356
LAURA: How many stakes?

02:07:49.356 --> 02:07:56.493
TALIESIN: You found two stakes and you found a
very weird silver chalice. It's

02:07:56.493 --> 02:07:59.960
interesting-looking. Could be something. Could be
nothing. No idea.

02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:03.508
LAURA: I stick that in my belt like I would at a
Ren Faire.

02:08:03.508 --> 02:08:05.630
TALIESIN: Ren-Faire style.

02:08:05.630 --> 02:08:10.654
LAURA: Yeah. Did I find a World of Warcraft weapon
too?

02:08:10.654 --> 02:08:13.469
TALISIN: Yeah. It's a big ridiculous sword that
would hang on a wall.

02:08:13.469 --> 02:08:15.565
LAURA: Whoa. Is it made of metal?

02:08:15.565 --> 02:08:16.941
TALIESIN: It's made out of a metal.

02:08:16.941 --> 02:08:18.682
LAURA: This is way too heavy for me.

02:08:18.682 --> 02:08:22.499
TALIESIN: Actually, what's your strength?

02:08:22.499 --> 02:08:24.365
LAURA: Two.

02:08:24.365 --> 02:08:31.383
TALIESIN: That's pretty good. That's a 110 pound--
that's a normal human. You're not quite

02:08:31.383 --> 02:08:35.339
supernatural, but you could be fine with it.

02:08:35.339 --> 02:08:36.709
LAURA: Yeah?

02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:41.112
TRAVIS: So Liam and I make our way out. Are we
sharing with the others what just happened?

02:08:41.112 --> 02:08:42.579
LAURA and SAM: What just happened?

02:08:42.579 --> 02:08:44.000
LIAM: That's a bad idea.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:45.148
LAURA: What was it?

02:08:45.148 --> 02:08:47.949
TRAVIS: We canvassed the offices and found--

02:08:47.949 --> 02:08:50.918
LIAM: Well, we wanted to find more weapons.

02:08:50.918 --> 02:08:53.372
TRAVIS: Yeah, I found this dagger! It's not super
sharp, but--

02:08:53.372 --> 02:08:54.445
SAM: I found a sword!

02:08:54.445 --> 02:08:55.450
LIAM: I got a bunch of pencils.

02:08:55.450 --> 02:08:59.231
LAURA: Look at this big-ass sword I found! Do you
want to switch me?

02:08:59.231 --> 02:09:01.176
LIAM: Maybe other people are vampires like us.

02:09:01.176 --> 02:09:02.684
LAURA: I'll take the dagger and you take the giant
sword?

02:09:02.684 --> 02:09:03.986
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:09:03.986 --> 02:09:06.247
LAURA: Okay. All right.

02:09:06.247 --> 02:09:10.893
TALIESIN: It's a good dagger. It's the S-curled one,
it's got the nice little--

02:09:10.893 --> 02:09:13.128
LAURA: This is really badass.

02:09:13.128 --> 02:09:16.519
LIAM: My internal monologue right now is really
pissed off that I did not get to taste Arcade.

02:09:16.519 --> 02:09:22.476
TALIESIN: I know. You know, there's still time.
Things can still get weird. We'll see.

02:09:22.476 --> 02:09:24.081
TRAVIS: Did you find anything out about the
puzzle?

02:09:24.081 --> 02:09:27.239
LAURA: Oh shit. I forgot we were trying to solve a
puzzle.

02:09:27.239 --> 02:09:33.150
SAM: Why don't we all look for puzzle clues? Or
should we try to do more to the-- that circle on

02:09:33.150 --> 02:09:35.457
the ground, Taliesin. How big is it?

02:09:35.457 --> 02:09:38.975
TALIESIN: It's slightly smaller than a children's
four-square court.

02:09:38.975 --> 02:09:42.756
SAM: Big enough that if it opened, we could fit
through it?

02:09:42.756 --> 02:09:51.808
TALIESIN: It's bled up into the door. It feels
like it's some sort of seal against the door

02:09:51.808 --> 02:09:52.846
itself.

02:09:52.846 --> 02:09:57.793
TRAVIS: Ooh! Wait a minute. Mercer died by the
sun, right? Don't we have his ashes in the Power

02:09:57.793 --> 02:10:03.420
Rangers helmet? I pour the ashes of Mercer onto
the sun square.

02:10:03.420 --> 02:10:12.254
TALIESIN: That's really fascinating. The ashes
start to mix with-- can't believe you did that. So

02:10:12.254 --> 02:10:17.740
frustrated. The ashes start to mix with the sun
symbol and it starts to boil.

02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:23.187
LAURA: Wait, Marisha died by mushrooms.

02:10:23.187 --> 02:10:29.899
SAM: We could put some mushrooms on the head?

02:10:29.899 --> 02:10:34.501
TALIESIN: Well, you didn't bring any of the
mushrooms because they looked a little--

02:10:34.501 --> 02:10:37.330
LAURA: He probably still has some on his skin!

02:10:37.330 --> 02:10:38.934
TALIESIN: He doesn't. He wiped them off.

02:10:38.934 --> 02:10:42.769
SAM: What would heads not like? Wait, suns cause
ashes--

02:10:42.769 --> 02:10:44.342
LAURA: Silver! Do we have any silver?

02:10:44.342 --> 02:10:46.289
SAM: We just found a sword. What if the sword
is--

02:10:46.289 --> 02:10:47.544
TRAVIS: Silver chalice. You have the silver
chalice.

02:10:47.544 --> 02:10:48.673
LAURA: Oh shit.

02:10:48.673 --> 02:10:50.537
TRAVIS: Holy fuck. Take notes.

02:10:50.537 --> 02:10:54.460
LAURA: I did! I had silver chalice written down. I
thought I could drink out of it.

02:10:54.460 --> 02:10:56.466
SAM: But would silver hurt a head?

02:10:56.466 --> 02:10:57.790
LAURA: Well, you could hit it.

02:10:57.790 --> 02:10:59.508
TRAVIS: Plus, Matt Key's head was in the office.

02:10:59.508 --> 02:11:04.495
LAURA: Silver is bad for vamp-- does this hurt to
hold?

02:11:04.495 --> 02:11:08.640
TRAVIS: I don't see any other clear connections.
How about we continue reconning the bottom of this

02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:10.855
floor? So who's going to take the audio booth?

02:11:10.855 --> 02:11:13.040
SAM: There's an audio booth here?

02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:15.381
LAURA: Yeah! It's right over in the corner over
there, dude!

02:11:15.381 --> 02:11:16.071
SAM: Really?

02:11:16.071 --> 02:11:20.996
LIAM: Yeah, you just come from your car right to
this table, so there's a whole bunch of areas you don't

02:11:21.081 --> 02:11:21.914
know about.

02:11:21.914 --> 02:11:23.383
LAURA: I'm going to go in the back offices.

02:11:23.383 --> 02:11:26.085
TRAVIS: You go in the very back, I'll take the
audio booth. Who wants the three bathrooms?

02:11:26.085 --> 02:11:27.707
SAM: I know where the bathrooms are!

02:11:27.707 --> 02:11:29.720
TALIESIN: My god, we've finally found a part
of--

02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:32.906
TRAVIS: What are you going to go?

02:11:32.906 --> 02:11:34.397
LIAM: I'll go with Sam, because we got to stick
together.

02:11:34.397 --> 02:11:35.377
SAM: Always.

02:11:35.377 --> 02:11:37.484
TRAVIS: I'm the closest, so I'll go into the
recording booth area.

02:11:37.484 --> 02:11:39.033
LAURA: I'll be at the back, all by myself.

02:11:39.033 --> 02:11:41.462
TALIESIN: The recording booth door is locked.

02:11:41.462 --> 02:11:43.146
TRAVIS: Well, it's locked, so--

02:11:43.146 --> 02:11:44.995
LAURA: You want to go to check out the back
offices with me?

02:11:44.995 --> 02:11:46.347
SAM: You are huge!

02:11:46.347 --> 02:11:48.896
LIAM: You can deadlift a house! You can't bust
that shit open?

02:11:48.896 --> 02:11:54.017
TRAVIS: It's pretty solid with a fire door. Well,
let me try it. Can I back up and try to run

02:11:54.017 --> 02:11:55.795
through the door?

02:11:55.795 --> 02:12:04.567
TALIESIN: Yeah. You don't have anything fancy for
that. Do a strength athletics just for fun.

02:12:04.567 --> 02:12:07.606
TRAVIS: So that loads me up pretty good.

02:12:07.606 --> 02:12:10.592
TALIESIN: That's a tough door, though.

02:12:10.592 --> 02:12:21.405
TRAVIS: That's a serious door. Yeah, it's no joke.
That is a ton of success. That's five successes

02:12:21.405 --> 02:12:22.633
and no failures.

02:12:22.633 --> 02:12:25.476
SAM: Whoa. Five successes, Taliesin.

02:12:25.476 --> 02:12:33.525
TALIESIN: (sighs) Man, I was really hoping-- well,
it's okay. I honestly wanted that door to survive

02:12:33.525 --> 02:12:35.873
because it's the most obnoxious door in the entire
building.

02:12:35.873 --> 02:12:36.941
TRAVIS: It really is, yeah.

02:12:36.941 --> 02:12:39.134
TALIESIN: It's the most obnoxious door in the
entire building. It's the only one the

02:12:39.134 --> 02:12:46.356
keycard won't open. I don't know why. But that
door comes off its hinges and pops open.

02:12:46.356 --> 02:12:47.321
LAURA: Holy crap!

02:12:47.321 --> 02:12:49.370
SAM: Wow, CrossFit!

02:12:49.370 --> 02:12:50.901
TRAVIS: Yeah, right?

02:12:50.901 --> 02:12:52.892
TALIESIN: It goes flying off.

02:12:52.892 --> 02:12:57.712
TRAVIS: In the doorway, with my heightened senses,
can I see anything in the darkened room?

02:12:57.712 --> 02:13:08.504
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. In the darkened room, you can
see in the corner there's two Twitch hosts cuddled

02:13:08.504 --> 02:13:12.213
up, hiding. They've been down there--

02:13:12.213 --> 02:13:13.340
LAURA: Erika!

02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:22.452
TALIESIN: No, it's not Erika. It appears to be Amy
Dallen and Jody Houser hiding in the corner. Jody

02:13:22.452 --> 02:13:26.278
has been furiously scribbling because she's afraid
she still actually has a deadline if she ever

02:13:26.278 --> 02:13:34.124
gets out of here. Amy Dallen has been slowly
building a little fort out of the computers to

02:13:34.124 --> 02:13:37.523
stave off whatever it is that's been--

02:13:37.523 --> 02:13:39.136
TRAVIS: Amy? Josie?

02:13:39.136 --> 02:13:40.625
TALIESIN: Jody. Amy and Jody.

02:13:40.625 --> 02:13:41.722
TRAVIS: Jody. Sorry.

02:13:41.722 --> 02:13:43.447
TALIESIN: It's okay. I've been doing a lot of
Josie lately.

02:13:43.447 --> 02:13:47.030
TRAVIS: Are you guys okay?

02:13:47.030 --> 02:13:49.421
TALIESIN: "Travis?"

02:13:49.421 --> 02:13:50.722
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:13:50.722 --> 02:13:55.839
TALIESIN: "It's not safe! Shut the-- oh."

02:13:55.839 --> 02:13:57.212
TRAVIS: I broke the door.

02:13:57.212 --> 02:14:01.841
TALIESIN: "There's things out there you don't--
oh, there's bad things out there."

02:14:01.841 --> 02:14:03.795
TRAVIS: Can I come in the room?

02:14:03.795 --> 02:14:06.497
TALIESIN: "Yeah. Of course."

02:14:06.497 --> 02:14:10.178
TRAVIS: Okay. I walk in the room a little bit. I'm
still holding a giant sword.

02:14:10.178 --> 02:14:12.401
SAM: He needs to be invited in. He's a vampire.

02:14:12.401 --> 02:14:14.023
TALIESIN: You don't need to be invited in,
really.

02:14:14.023 --> 02:14:15.434
TRAVIS: I don't? Oh shit.

02:14:15.434 --> 02:14:17.532
TALIESIN: I'm glad you asked, though. It's very
polite.

02:14:17.532 --> 02:14:19.805
TRAVIS: I was like, I know this fucking game!

02:14:19.895 --> 02:14:22.119
LIAM: Let the right one in.

02:14:22.119 --> 02:14:25.638
TRAVIS: Can I tuck the sword behind my back real
quick?

02:14:25.638 --> 02:14:26.956
TALIESIN: Yeah, they saw it but--

02:14:26.956 --> 02:14:29.224
TRAVIS: It's not for you.

02:14:29.224 --> 02:14:32.842
TALIESIN: They're hip to what's going on and you
do not look like what they're afraid of. They're

02:14:32.842 --> 02:14:33.820
not afraid of you yet.

02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:35.226
TRAVIS: So I'm in the little engineering room,
right?

02:14:35.226 --> 02:14:35.989
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:14:35.989 --> 02:14:40.520
TRAVIS: Is the booth clear? Is there anything in
there? You're sure?

02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:44.189
TALIESIN: "Just food and drinks. That's all we've
just--"

02:14:44.189 --> 02:14:49.278
TRAVIS: Do you mind if I look? Stay right where
you are. Please. Don't move. Can I walk over to

02:14:49.278 --> 02:14:51.732
the door and look through and see what's in the
booth?

02:14:51.732 --> 02:14:53.858
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. Nothing.

02:14:53.858 --> 02:14:56.033
TRAVIS: Nothing? Not even food or drinks?

02:14:56.033 --> 02:15:01.403
TALIESIN: No, I mean food and drink. They've got a
stash of-- they obviously raided a terrible

02:15:01.403 --> 02:15:07.763
Nerdist shoot for Cheetos and whatever. And,
weirdly, yet another box of Lucky Charms. I don't

02:15:07.763 --> 02:15:09.107
know why we have so many of them.

02:15:09.107 --> 02:15:10.713
TRAVIS: Laura! Come in here!

02:15:10.713 --> 02:15:12.984
LAURA: I'm already in the back office.

02:15:12.984 --> 02:15:15.457
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Can anybody hear me?

02:15:15.457 --> 02:15:17.606
TALIESIN: Does anybody--

02:15:17.606 --> 02:15:19.263
SAM: We went to the bathroom.

02:15:19.263 --> 02:15:22.632
TALIESIN: So depending on how loud you were, they
probably couldn't hear you.

02:15:22.632 --> 02:15:23.678
TRAVIS: Yeah, that wasn't that loud.

02:15:23.678 --> 02:15:26.161
LIAM: We might have faintly heard (muffled
noises).

02:15:26.161 --> 02:15:28.955
TRAVIS: Can I try to open the booth door?

02:15:28.955 --> 02:15:31.235
TALIESIN: Yeah, it opens just fine.

02:15:31.235 --> 02:15:35.030
TRAVIS: Can I peek my head in and look behind the
door? Check the corners.

02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:36.622
TALIESIN: Man! You are nervous!

02:15:36.622 --> 02:15:38.049
TRAVIS: Just make sure it's food and drink.

02:15:38.049 --> 02:15:41.726
TALIESIN: As far as you can tell, it's just food
and drink.

02:15:41.726 --> 02:15:48.956
TRAVIS: Can I use my Aura Perception to see if
there is anything else in the room?

02:15:48.956 --> 02:15:50.360
TALIESIN: What's the roll for that?

02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:56.155
TRAVIS: It says hunger roll, perception plus
empathy minus manipulation plus willpower. No,

02:15:56.155 --> 02:15:58.510
versus. Manipulation versus plus
willpower.

02:15:58.510 --> 02:16:04.442
TALIESIN: Or a perception against people, I
believe. So who are you running it against? And

02:16:04.490 --> 02:16:08.010
you can use it to figure out things like what
kind of creature someone is, you can get a

02:16:08.081 --> 02:16:09.317
notion of how they're feeling.

02:16:09.317 --> 02:16:14.120
TRAVIS: Let me get a notion of how Amy is
feeling since Jody is just writing.

02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:17.195
TALIESIN: Yeah, Jody may have snapped a little.
It's tough to tell.

02:16:17.195 --> 02:16:18.585
TRAVIS: She's on the other side.

02:16:18.585 --> 02:16:26.765
TALIESIN: Sure. Make the roll and I'm going to use
my fancy rolls now because things are going to get

02:16:26.765 --> 02:16:28.394
weird. Have a blood die.

02:16:28.394 --> 02:16:31.042
TRAVIS: So I roll three of these, right?

02:16:31.042 --> 02:16:34.680
TALIESIN: That one after. I think you get it next
roll.

02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:41.682
TRAVIS: Three successes, no failures.

02:16:41.682 --> 02:16:45.382
TALIESIN: Three successes, no failures? And what's
it versus for her?

02:16:45.382 --> 02:16:47.432
TRAVIS: Manipulation plus willpower.

02:16:47.432 --> 02:16:49.453
LIAM and LAURA: I don't like it!

02:16:49.453 --> 02:16:52.180
TALIESIN: That is something you do hear, but it's
coming from somewhere.

02:16:52.180 --> 02:16:54.037
LAURA: Oh god.

02:16:54.037 --> 02:17:01.522
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. She's scared, but she's been
here for a while and it's tough to tell how long

02:17:01.522 --> 02:17:08.423
and has gone into full fight-or-flight mode and has
definitely gone fight. And you definitely get the

02:17:08.423 --> 02:17:13.947
sense that, and you can read this from her aura,
she is human and she has killed something within

02:17:13.947 --> 02:17:18.028
the last 72 hours. You don't know what.

02:17:18.028 --> 02:17:26.140
TRAVIS: Amy. I'm going to ask you to move back
into the booth until we can make sure it's more

02:17:26.140 --> 02:17:30.679
safe. Can you tell me what you've seen and what
you were hiding from?

02:17:30.679 --> 02:17:43.468
TALIESIN: (sighs) "There was a man. He was older. I
didn't recognize him and he came with people.

02:17:43.468 --> 02:17:49.734
"There was some creature and something's wrong with
Ivan and--"

02:17:49.734 --> 02:17:52.530
LAURA: We haven't even seen Ivan yet.

02:17:52.530 --> 02:17:53.835
LIAM: Daddy Chops.

02:17:53.835 --> 02:18:07.257
TALIESIN: "There was these things with these large
eyes and these vacant mouths and I fought one and

02:18:07.257 --> 02:18:09.497
"then we've been hiding in here. I don't know how
long."

02:18:09.497 --> 02:18:14.577
TRAVIS: We've seen the vacant eyes and mouths as
well. We put down two ourselves. They laughed

02:18:14.577 --> 02:18:16.043
afterwards.

02:18:16.043 --> 02:18:17.571
TALIESIN: "Yeah, they do that."

02:18:17.571 --> 02:18:19.805
TRAVIS: That's really disturbing.

02:18:19.805 --> 02:18:26.321
TALIESIN: "It is! I would say it's been a long
couple days, except I don't know how long it's been."

02:18:26.321 --> 02:18:30.081
TRAVIS: Okay. I can't promise that it's safe
outside of this room and I'm sorry I broke the

02:18:30.081 --> 02:18:32.185
door. Will you just wait inside the booth?

02:18:32.185 --> 02:18:39.270
TALIESIN: "How about you put the door back and
we'll reinforce it and then knock seven times when

02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:43.158
"the coast is clear because no one will knock seven
times, because that's ridiculous."

02:18:43.158 --> 02:18:50.672
TRAVIS: That's my normal knock, but okay, that
sounds fair enough. Can I make a look around the

02:18:50.672 --> 02:18:59.814
room before I leave for anything that might be
used as a weapon? It's pretty bare, right?

02:18:59.814 --> 02:19:05.618
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's pretty bare. There's just the
desks and a decent rough cut of Thrashtopia

02:19:05.618 --> 02:19:08.546
rolling on one of the monitors that's flickering.

02:19:08.546 --> 02:19:12.502
TRAVIS: I'll pick up the door, back out of the
room and pull it back there with the handle.

02:19:12.502 --> 02:19:15.915
TALIESIN: Good, man. Wow, that's a nice vampire.
That's good.

02:19:15.915 --> 02:19:18.489
LAURA: He's not feeling it yet.

02:19:18.489 --> 02:19:20.208
TALIESIN: Where are you at? Three?

02:19:20.208 --> 02:19:21.158
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:19:21.158 --> 02:19:24.778
TALIESIN: All right. We'll see how we feel in a
minute. Cool.

02:19:24.778 --> 02:19:27.455
LAURA: What happens if you get five hungers?

02:19:27.455 --> 02:19:28.729
TRAVIS: That's a great question.

02:19:28.729 --> 02:19:30.272
TALIESIN: That's a great question.

02:19:30.272 --> 02:19:36.379
LAURA: I'm going to go back in the back office.
I'm going to use my Obfuscate.

02:19:36.379 --> 02:19:38.487
TALIESIN: Because you have a second-level version,
right?

02:19:38.487 --> 02:19:41.991
LAURA: That's right. So I can be totally
sneaky.

02:19:41.991 --> 02:19:45.680
TALIESIN: You're going to be super sneaky. You're going
to burn a blood for that.

02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:47.518
LAURA: Okay. What does that mean? I get another
blood?

02:19:47.518 --> 02:19:49.700
TALIESIN: Roll a d10. What did you get?

02:19:49.700 --> 02:19:50.502
LAURA: Two.

02:19:50.502 --> 02:19:57.842
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, you get-- actually, this is not
the normal rolls. This is me doing terrible things

02:19:57.842 --> 02:19:59.481
because this is a short game.

02:19:59.481 --> 02:20:03.230
LAURA: I get two extra-- I'm so hungry all of a
sudden.

02:20:03.230 --> 02:20:11.262
TALIESIN: You turned practically invisible, but it
cost you. So you're going all the way back?

02:20:11.262 --> 02:20:15.613
LAURA: Past where we filmed the Slayers' Cake
thing.

02:20:15.613 --> 02:20:16.890
TALIESIN: Past the library?

02:20:16.890 --> 02:20:18.140
LAURA: Through to--

02:20:18.140 --> 02:20:22.189
TALIESIN: Things start to get very weird back
there.

02:20:22.189 --> 02:20:25.780
LAURA: I'm looking for writing, any clues I can
find.

02:20:25.780 --> 02:20:44.210
TALIESIN: So as you turn the corner, the ground
starts to slowly get dark and strangely inky. That

02:20:44.210 --> 02:20:49.508
whole office that you're used to seeing has been
cleared and is empty.

02:20:49.508 --> 02:20:51.456
LAURA: There's nobody in here?

02:20:51.456 --> 02:20:56.924
TALIESIN: There's a table in the middle of the
room. And in the darkness, you can't quite see the

02:20:56.924 --> 02:21:05.522
walls. It's like you turned the corner and there's a
table, almost in a void. And at the table are four

02:21:05.522 --> 02:21:16.268
people playing cards. It's Ivan. Ivan van Norman
is playing cards with Amy Vorpahl and Damion

02:21:16.268 --> 02:21:23.509
Poitier and Sam. They're all sitting, playing
cards. Ivan--

02:21:23.509 --> 02:21:25.384
SAM: Not me Sam. There's another Sam.

02:21:25.384 --> 02:21:26.703
TALIESIN: No, the other Sam.

02:21:26.703 --> 02:21:27.928
TRAVIS: Ivan, Amy, Damion--

02:21:27.928 --> 02:21:35.526
TALIESIN: And Sam are playing cards. It's not a
game you recognize. Ivan's having a great time.

02:21:35.526 --> 02:21:39.412
Everybody else looks a little nervous.

02:21:39.412 --> 02:21:42.143
LAURA: Do they smell good?

02:21:42.143 --> 02:21:43.882
TALIESIN: They do.

02:21:43.882 --> 02:21:45.293
LAURA: Does Ivan smell good?

02:21:45.293 --> 02:21:58.485
TALIESIN: Ivan smells pretty good, but Ivan smells
a little burnt and his hair is-- what is the most

02:21:58.485 --> 02:22:03.184
terrifying thing I can say about hair? It's like
Yahoo Serious hair. That is the most terrifying.

02:22:03.184 --> 02:22:10.081
Thank you. It's standing up like he's been
shocked, like he's been putting his tongue in a

02:22:10.081 --> 02:22:11.035
socket.

02:22:11.035 --> 02:22:12.420
LIAM: Is that true of his sideburns as well?

02:22:12.420 --> 02:22:13.738
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. They're all the way out.

02:22:13.738 --> 02:22:19.856
LAURA: Whose back is to me as I'm coming around
the corner? I'm assuming they don't see me because I'm--

02:22:19.856 --> 02:22:21.599
TALIESIN: They don't, and it would be--

02:22:21.599 --> 02:22:23.113
LAURA: Ivan?

02:22:23.113 --> 02:22:36.032
TALIESIN: Damion's back is to you, although Sam
has just pulled a card. They're showing the card.

02:22:36.032 --> 02:22:47.855
And they're showing the card to Ivan. You can't
quite make out what Ivan's saying, but Sam's not

02:22:47.855 --> 02:22:55.787
having a good time about it and is arguing with
the rules for some strange reason. And out of

02:22:55.787 --> 02:23:03.753
nowhere, a large spider comes out and pulls very
quickly Sam entirely away from the table.

02:23:03.753 --> 02:23:05.179
TRAVIS: What? From where?

02:23:05.179 --> 02:23:06.431
LAURA: Into the back corner?

02:23:06.431 --> 02:23:16.177
TALIESIN: Whatever is back there. And then a
chair floats into view and rolls up to where Sam

02:23:16.177 --> 02:23:20.788
was. You just heard screams and a spider clack of
(muffled sounds).

02:23:20.788 --> 02:23:24.040
SAM: That's quite a card game.

02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:29.180
TALIESIN: Ivan turns. "Amy, you're up."

02:23:29.180 --> 02:23:33.056
LAURA: And Ivan seems completely unfazed by it?
But everybody else is creeped out?

02:23:33.056 --> 02:23:37.434
TALIESIN: Yeah, Ivan's running a game, and it's
Amy's turn.

02:23:37.434 --> 02:23:41.903
LAURA: Can I sneak around the room so I'm behind
Ivan?

02:23:41.903 --> 02:23:45.679
TALIESIN: That might be difficult, but you can
give it a try.

02:23:45.679 --> 02:23:49.414
LAURA: Am I going to die?

02:23:49.414 --> 02:23:58.917
TALIESIN: There's no roll for that second
Obfuscate. You just burn and you do it, right?

02:23:58.917 --> 02:24:01.526
LAURA: I just do it. Oh wait. No, wits and
stealth.

02:24:01.526 --> 02:24:02.868
TALIESIN: Roll a wits stealth.

02:24:02.868 --> 02:24:04.174
LAURA: Oh, I should have done that earlier!

02:24:04.174 --> 02:24:06.471
TALIESIN: It's okay. This will work just fine.

02:24:06.471 --> 02:24:08.413
LAURA: Do I have to use my two news?

02:24:08.413 --> 02:24:09.363
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

02:24:09.363 --> 02:24:10.216
LAURA: I do?

02:24:10.216 --> 02:24:11.280
TALIESIN: Yeah, you do.

02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:12.819
LAURA: I have to roll three reds on this?

02:24:12.819 --> 02:24:13.675
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:24:13.675 --> 02:24:16.944
Should've taken your head out of your ass, let's
go!

02:24:16.944 --> 02:24:23.951
LAURA: Shut your fucking face! Stealth and wits.
Okay, hold on. (counting)

02:24:23.951 --> 02:24:25.379
LIAM: Let's go, vampire.

02:24:25.379 --> 02:24:29.449
LAURA: Okay, I got to choose my right dice here.
Okay, here we go. Oh my god.

02:24:29.449 --> 02:24:31.988
LIAM and LAURA: Come on!

02:24:31.988 --> 02:24:35.465
LIAM: Oh shit! Two failures.

02:24:35.465 --> 02:24:37.320
TRAVIS and LIAM: On the reds.

02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:38.978
LAURA: But I got a success!

02:24:38.978 --> 02:24:44.234
TALIESIN: Two failures on the red? All right, this
is fun. How hungry are you?

02:24:44.234 --> 02:24:49.314
LAURA: It was already three and just because I did
Obfuscate. It seems a little fucked up that I have

02:24:49.314 --> 02:24:54.084
to use my new hungers on my power! You didn't have
to do that! &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; didn't have to do that!

02:24:54.084 --> 02:24:57.021
TRAVIS: Quit blaming other people for your
weakness.

02:24:57.021 --> 02:24:58.539
LAURA: I'm just saying, it's bullshit.

02:24:58.539 --> 02:25:00.858
LIAM: You're rules-lawyering a game you barely
understand!

02:25:00.858 --> 02:25:01.982
LAURA: Yeah, well--

02:25:01.982 --> 02:25:07.937
TALIESIN: Here's the deal: you're going to get
seen. But we'll deal with that, because I want you

02:25:07.937 --> 02:25:12.406
to make a note: you are hangry.

02:25:12.406 --> 02:25:15.032
LAURA: I'm really fucking hungry.

02:25:15.032 --> 02:25:20.923
TALIESIN: As in life. No, I have options here, and
I'm going hangry. You are down three on any

02:25:20.923 --> 02:25:26.417
persuasion or subterfuge rolls because you are not
going to be subtle or cunning about anything.

02:25:26.417 --> 02:25:32.488
Until you feed, you're going to be really on
edge.

02:25:32.488 --> 02:25:34.950
LIAM: Time for a Taco Hell run.

02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:47.533
TALIESIN: Amy Vorpahl frighteningly pulls a card,
puts it down, closes her eyes. Ivan pulls the

02:25:47.533 --> 02:25:49.988
card, looks at it, smiles.

02:25:49.988 --> 02:25:52.503
LAURA: Do they see me yet?

02:25:52.503 --> 02:26:03.096
TALIESIN: Not yet. And then Ivan turns to Amy, and
Amy... it's like every piece of her rotates 45

02:26:03.096 --> 02:26:12.261
degrees against itself. Not like meat, but like
glass, and then she shatters like a mirror. And

02:26:12.261 --> 02:26:14.277
then a new chair pops right up.

02:26:14.277 --> 02:26:16.012
TRAVIS: Cleanly? Does blood explode?

02:26:16.012 --> 02:26:17.304
TALIESIN: No, it's just glass.

02:26:17.304 --> 02:26:21.303
TRAVIS: Fragments? Amy fragments?

02:26:21.303 --> 02:26:25.276
LAURA: Did it seem like Amy was a vampire before
she shattered?

02:26:25.276 --> 02:26:27.996
TALIESIN: No, she smelled pretty good.

02:26:27.996 --> 02:26:30.122
LAURA: Can I--

02:26:30.122 --> 02:26:35.057
TALIESIN: Ivan turns to you, but Damion has not
seen you.

02:26:35.057 --> 02:26:38.775
LAURA: I'm going to walk up behind Damion 
and bite the shit out of his neck.

02:26:38.775 --> 02:26:44.188
TALIESIN: Okay, you have surprise on him, but not
Ivan. Ivan's going to allow it.

02:26:44.188 --> 02:26:46.130
LAURA: Okay, I figured.

02:26:46.130 --> 02:26:55.667
TALIESIN: Roll-- actually, since this is surprise.
Roll wits. This is going to be weird. Roll wits

02:26:55.667 --> 02:27:00.495
and stealth. I'm going to make this a weird one.

02:27:00.495 --> 02:27:03.731
LAURA: That's what I just rolled, and it was not
good.

02:27:03.731 --> 02:27:10.064
TALIESIN: Yeah, try it again. How much are you
going to eat him? Are you going to eat him a

02:27:10.064 --> 02:27:12.083
little, some, or a lot?

02:27:12.083 --> 02:27:14.901
LAURA: (whispering) I want to suck his blood.

02:27:14.901 --> 02:27:15.964
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:27:15.964 --> 02:27:19.446
LAURA: A good amount of it. Not all of it.

02:27:19.446 --> 02:27:20.519
TALIESIN: Not all of it?

02:27:20.519 --> 02:27:29.737
LAURA: I'm going to leave him twitching. Success.
One success.

02:27:29.737 --> 02:27:30.970
TALIESIN: One success?

02:27:30.970 --> 02:27:32.062
LAURA: Yeah.

02:27:32.062 --> 02:27:43.973
TALIESIN: That didn't count, because that hit
paper. Ignore me. Boy, he did not see you coming.

02:27:43.973 --> 02:27:44.925
LAURA: He didn't?

02:27:44.925 --> 02:27:45.821
TALIESIN: Nope.

02:27:45.821 --> 02:27:47.073
LAURA: So I get to suck his blood.

02:27:47.073 --> 02:27:51.393
TALIESIN: Yeah, but only one point worth, because
that was not a lot of success.

02:27:51.393 --> 02:27:52.862
LAURA: At least that's something.

02:27:52.862 --> 02:27:56.521
TALIESIN: He's very conscious and aware that
something is on his neck right now, and he's

02:27:56.521 --> 02:27:59.229
freaking out. He's going to take a swipe at you.

02:27:59.229 --> 02:28:01.153
LAURA: Maybe I'm part of Ivan's game.

02:28:01.153 --> 02:28:02.584
LIAM: He's real big.

02:28:02.584 --> 02:28:03.866
TALIESIN: Yeah, he's a big guy.

02:28:03.866 --> 02:28:05.245
LAURA: He had a lot of blood.

02:28:05.245 --> 02:28:08.911
TALIESIN: He's currently wearing my jacket, too,
so if you get any blood on my jacket, I'm going to

02:28:08.911 --> 02:28:10.066
be very upset.

02:28:10.066 --> 02:28:13.260
SAM: Is he wearing your jacket because you're
dead?

02:28:13.260 --> 02:28:18.123
TALIESIN: No, he's wearing my jacket because I
lent it to him at the end of Wednesday Club last

02:28:18.123 --> 02:28:20.587
week, and I haven't gotten it back yet.

02:28:20.587 --> 02:28:24.842
LAURA: You smell like Taliesin. Where's Taliesin?

02:28:24.842 --> 02:28:34.619
TALIESIN: That got weird. Thank you. So I'm
figuring out how to do this. He's going to try and

02:28:34.619 --> 02:28:46.389
kick you off. Roll dex dodge, because he's going
to try and take a swipe at you. Dex dodge, and if

02:28:46.389 --> 02:28:50.930
you want, you can burn willpower to roll the ones
you don't like over again.

02:28:50.930 --> 02:28:54.435
LIAM: That's five. You get four, right?

02:28:54.435 --> 02:28:56.234
LAURA: I get five.

02:28:56.234 --> 02:28:57.419
LIAM: Three, plus?

02:28:57.419 --> 02:29:00.125
LAURA: Dodge. It's four.

02:29:00.125 --> 02:29:02.980
TALIESIN: Anything over a six?

02:29:02.980 --> 02:29:04.708
LAURA: One success.

02:29:04.708 --> 02:29:07.917
SAM and TALIESIN: Burn a will.

02:29:07.917 --> 02:29:11.010
LAURA: I don't even know what that means!

02:29:11.010 --> 02:29:14.642
TALIESIN: Do you see those little will dots? You
burn one, and you can reroll any of the

02:29:14.642 --> 02:29:16.697
dice you like.

02:29:16.697 --> 02:29:17.924
TRAVIS: Are you marking it off?

02:29:17.924 --> 02:29:20.785
LAURA: And for each willpower, I reroll a dice?

02:29:20.785 --> 02:29:24.183
TALIESIN: You can reroll as many dice as you like
on one roll, for one willpower.

02:29:24.183 --> 02:29:31.261
LAURA: Okay, I'll try it, because you're saying to
do it. Two more successes.

02:29:31.261 --> 02:29:38.301
TALIESIN: That's all you needed. There's a rule
that I forgot, but that's okay. I'll do it next

02:29:38.301 --> 02:29:42.771
time. I'll remember that. Succeed at a cost. I
keep forgetting about succeed at a cost. It's

02:29:42.771 --> 02:29:48.259
really cool. Yeah, you slap him down, and you're
right back in his neck, if you want to do a

02:29:48.259 --> 02:29:56.896
strength plus two for your vampire fangs.

02:29:56.896 --> 02:29:58.541
LAURA: Strength plus two?

02:29:58.541 --> 02:29:59.894
TALIESIN: Yeah, strength plus two dice.

02:29:59.894 --> 02:30:01.165
LIAM: Get that Big Gulp.

02:30:01.165 --> 02:30:09.875
LAURA: (chomping sounds) Ooh. Well, no. No
failures, but one success.

02:30:09.875 --> 02:30:11.848
TALIESIN: One success? You get one more out of
him.

02:30:11.848 --> 02:30:14.660
LIAM: Why did you hit the mouse again?

02:30:14.660 --> 02:30:16.374
TALIESIN: Why do you keep hitting my mouse, man?

02:30:16.374 --> 02:30:19.203
LAURA: Well, he's sitting right there.

02:30:19.203 --> 02:30:21.238
TALIESIN: Do you want to keep draining or do you
want to back off?

02:30:21.238 --> 02:30:22.997
LAURA: No, I'm good. I'm going to let him live.

02:30:22.997 --> 02:30:25.042
TALIESIN: Are you going to back off or you just
let go?

02:30:25.042 --> 02:30:30.380
LAURA: I'm going to push him forward against the
table and back off really quickly.

02:30:30.380 --> 02:30:34.254
TALIESIN: Are you going to push him forward
against the table?

02:30:34.254 --> 02:30:36.832
LAURA: Yeah. So he doesn't lunge at me as I back
up.

02:30:36.832 --> 02:30:45.889
TALIESIN: (snorts) Yeah, fuck it. That's funny.
I'm going to let that happen. He slips as you push

02:30:45.889 --> 02:30:51.806
him towards the table and he leaves his seat and
falls off into the darkness. He falls like he fell

02:30:51.806 --> 02:30:53.954
off a building &lt;i&gt;down&lt;/i&gt;.

02:30:53.954 --> 02:30:56.290
LAURA: Like he can't walk in the darkness like I'm
walking?

02:30:56.290 --> 02:31:01.364
TALIESIN: He was on the table and you pushed off
and pushed him off his seat and there's no floor

02:31:01.364 --> 02:31:03.458
apparently because he just dropped.

02:31:03.458 --> 02:31:06.100
LAURA: Whoops.

02:31:06.100 --> 02:31:10.096
TALIESIN: You seem to be standing on it fine, but
it didn't work for him.

02:31:10.096 --> 02:31:12.060
LAURA: What? Ivan, hi.

02:31:12.060 --> 02:31:19.043
TALIESIN: "Hey, Laura. It's so good to see you.
This is great."

02:31:19.043 --> 02:31:21.453
LAURA: You too, man. This looked like a pretty
crazy game you're playing.

02:31:21.453 --> 02:31:24.290
TALIESIN: "I've been really excited. I've been
wanting to get you in one of my games for a while.

02:31:24.290 --> 02:31:28.115
"This is the best one I've put together in quite a
while."

02:31:28.115 --> 02:31:29.984
LAURA: Yeah, I remember Paranoia with you.

02:31:29.984 --> 02:31:36.100
TALIESIN: "That was fun. My whole game has gone
to another level. I've had a really-- this has

02:31:36.100 --> 02:31:38.257
"been a good year. You want to play?"

02:31:38.257 --> 02:31:40.149
LAURA: No, you know what? I think I'm good.

02:31:40.149 --> 02:31:43.566
TALIESIN: "I think it could be worth your while."

02:31:43.566 --> 02:31:54.602
LAURA: Do you know what the deal is with that
circle out by the Twitch door is?

02:31:54.602 --> 02:32:02.476
TALIESIN: "I do. I know a lot about what's going on.
I have talked to so many people."

02:32:02.476 --> 02:32:03.937
LAURA: You have?

02:32:03.937 --> 02:32:07.410
TALIESIN: "Oh, yes I have. It's been
fascinating."

02:32:07.410 --> 02:32:12.861
LAURA: How long has &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; been?

02:32:12.861 --> 02:32:17.585
TALIESIN: (sighs) "I feel you haven't earned that
kind of information yet. Honestly, I feel that

02:32:17.585 --> 02:32:23.859
"this whole sneaking-up-on-my-game and trying to
like-- honestly, costing Damion his turn. That's

02:32:23.859 --> 02:32:24.842
"just tacky."

02:32:24.842 --> 02:32:26.942
LAURA: I just thought we're on the same side
here.

02:32:26.942 --> 02:32:32.603
TALIESIN: "There's no sides. We're all friends and
it's just a game. You want to play the game?"

02:32:32.603 --> 02:32:35.372
LAURA: No!

02:32:35.372 --> 02:32:44.131
TALIESIN: "I'll make it worth your while. You win
a little bit and maybe there'll be some answers in

02:32:44.131 --> 02:32:45.498
"here for you."

02:32:45.498 --> 02:32:47.468
LAURA: It didn't seem like it was possible to
win?

02:32:47.468 --> 02:33:00.683
TALIESIN: "Well, here's what I'll say. I have so
many cards that could be pulled and the cards they

02:33:00.683 --> 02:33:02.365
"pulled are already gone--"

02:33:02.365 --> 02:33:04.974
LAURA: Travis learned this lesson before.

02:33:04.974 --> 02:33:08.490
TALIESIN: "See, if you think about it though,
Travis is really the reason this is happening

02:33:08.490 --> 02:33:13.658
"right now. The whole theory for this game is
because of Travis. You should pull a card. He

02:33:13.658 --> 02:33:16.092
"really likes it when you pull cards."

02:33:16.092 --> 02:33:17.610
TRAVIS: I really do.

02:33:17.610 --> 02:33:22.987
TALIESIN: "Pulling cards makes the Father happy."

02:33:22.987 --> 02:33:25.737
LAURA: I kind of want to pull a card.

02:33:25.737 --> 02:33:27.092
SAM: Sure. Of course you do.

02:33:27.092 --> 02:33:28.231
TALIESIN: "Sit down."

02:33:28.231 --> 02:33:31.214
TRAVIS: Yeah! (laughs) Yes!

02:33:31.214 --> 02:33:32.530
SAM: Oh boy.

02:33:32.530 --> 02:33:35.707
LAURA: I will sit down if you answer a question as
I sit down and then I'll pull a card.

02:33:35.707 --> 02:33:39.162
TALIESIN: "It entirely depends on the question."

02:33:39.162 --> 02:33:43.505
LAURA: Okay. I sit down.

02:33:43.505 --> 02:33:47.015
TALIESIN: You feel heavy as you sit down.

02:33:47.015 --> 02:33:51.920
LAURA: This is a stupid idea. Marisha sat down and
had some tea. She died.

02:33:51.920 --> 02:33:57.924
TALIESIN: "Marisha drank the tea? Oh, he's not
going to be happy. Why would she-- that's not smart."

02:33:57.924 --> 02:34:00.817
LAURA: I don't know. I wasn't there. I just know
that she drank tea and then she turned into a

02:34:00.817 --> 02:34:01.707
mushroom.

02:34:01.707 --> 02:34:03.035
TALIESIN: "Yeah, that'll happen."

02:34:03.035 --> 02:34:14.054
LAURA: How come we were put in coffins and turned
into vampires and some people are delicious?

02:34:14.054 --> 02:34:20.174
TALIESIN: "Oh, that's really complicated. That's a
very complicated question. There's a lot happening

02:34:20.174 --> 02:34:28.896
"and I'm going to be honest with you. Not all of
this was the plan. I specifically get the feeling

02:34:28.896 --> 02:34:33.138
"that a lot of this has gone a little off-track."

02:34:33.138 --> 02:34:35.256
LAURA: Yeah. It seems like it.

02:34:35.256 --> 02:34:39.479
TALIESIN: "It does, doesn't it? I'm doing what I
can, but really, what can we do other than trying

02:34:39.479 --> 02:34:41.657
"to make some good content, you know?"

02:34:41.657 --> 02:34:47.166
LAURA: Right. Yeah. Just waiting for the door to
open to the Twitch stage.

02:34:47.166 --> 02:34:50.554
TALIESIN: "That's a cute, clever puzzle. How are
you doing on that?"

02:34:50.554 --> 02:34:55.307
LAURA: Well, we're doing pretty good. Pretty good.
Looking for clues.

02:34:55.307 --> 02:34:57.310
TALIESIN: "What have you solved so far?"

02:34:57.310 --> 02:35:10.052
LAURA: I will answer that if you make sure I pull
a good card. Beneficial card for me, not for you.

02:35:10.052 --> 02:35:16.116
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

02:35:16.116 --> 02:35:21.536
TALIESIN: Electricity crackles from the back of
his spine and seems to make an arcing pattern

02:35:21.536 --> 02:35:28.257
through the darkness that's almost a circuit
breaker. "Oh, heart and sun. Not bad."

02:35:28.257 --> 02:35:30.367
LAURA: Oh shit.

02:35:30.367 --> 02:35:31.771
SAM: He knows things.

02:35:31.771 --> 02:35:39.463
TALIESIN: "I'm running a game here. I got to be on
top of it. If you're not on top of it, that's how you lose!"

02:35:39.463 --> 02:35:43.240
LAURA: I turned into a vampire, you're some weird
electric thing! That's fun.

02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:46.918
(laughter)

02:35:46.982 --> 02:35:50.823
TALIESIN: (sighs) "It's just crazy, the sorts of
people you work with here, isn't it?"

02:35:50.823 --> 02:35:52.124
LAURA: I know.

02:35:52.124 --> 02:35:59.085
TALIESIN: "Yeah. He'll be very happy if you take a
card. You can yell for people, by the way. There's no

02:35:59.085 --> 02:36:00.589
"problem. This is a game for everybody."

02:36:00.589 --> 02:36:02.109
LAURA: Yeah, I did yell for him.

02:36:02.109 --> 02:36:03.949
TRAVIS: How loud?

02:36:03.949 --> 02:36:06.519
LAURA: Travis? About that loud.

02:36:06.519 --> 02:36:07.868
TRAVIS: That's-- I mean, you're way back there.

02:36:07.868 --> 02:36:09.790
LAURA: I know. But I don't know how quiet it is in
the building.

02:36:09.790 --> 02:36:11.101
TALIESIN: And you do have--

02:36:11.101 --> 02:36:13.269
TRAVIS: I do have Heightened Senses! Can I hear
her?

02:36:13.269 --> 02:36:14.769
TALIESIN: How loud?

02:36:14.769 --> 02:36:16.175
LAURA: Travis?

02:36:16.175 --> 02:36:18.282
TALIESIN: No. (laughs)

02:36:18.282 --> 02:36:22.758
TRAVIS: I mean, if you want to be a big girl about
it. (laughs)

02:36:22.758 --> 02:36:26.213
LIAM: Can we lower the gain on the mic, though?

02:36:26.213 --> 02:36:31.624
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, that's fair. "I
mean, we can call everybody over if you like."

02:36:31.624 --> 02:36:36.982
LAURA: I just feel like he's really going to want
to pull a card and I don't know if he should. I

02:36:36.982 --> 02:36:41.379
feel like maybe, if this is a bad thing, then
we'll-- this will be just me and then they will

02:36:41.379 --> 02:36:42.747
never know.

02:36:42.747 --> 02:36:44.721
TALIESIN: "All right."

02:36:44.721 --> 02:36:46.712
TRAVIS: This has been going on for a while.

02:36:46.712 --> 02:36:47.996
LAURA: Yeah.

02:36:47.996 --> 02:36:49.776
TALIESIN: Pick a card.

02:36:49.776 --> 02:36:51.269
LAURA: (yells)

02:36:51.269 --> 02:36:52.700
TALIESIN: Make a pull.

02:36:52.700 --> 02:36:56.396
LAURA: Is this one of those magician tricks where
you're telling me to pull a certain one and I

02:36:56.396 --> 02:36:57.442
don't realise it?

02:36:57.442 --> 02:36:58.450
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:36:58.450 --> 02:37:00.827
TRAVIS: I'll say I pulled from the middle before
and it was the Void.

02:37:00.827 --> 02:37:06.509
TALIESIN: There is no Void card in this set
because this is not a Deck of Many Things. You

02:37:06.509 --> 02:37:11.459
pulled the Two of Swords. Oh dear.

02:37:11.459 --> 02:37:12.827
SAM: Which is?

02:37:12.827 --> 02:37:22.626
TALIESIN: Two of Swords is two bleeds. Suddenly,
blood gets sucked straight out of your fingertips

02:37:22.626 --> 02:37:28.934
through the card into the base.

02:37:28.934 --> 02:37:30.624
LAURA: Oh no, I just got rid of these things!

02:37:30.624 --> 02:37:31.702
TALIESIN: Two more.

02:37:31.702 --> 02:37:33.615
LAURA: Shit! Ugh.

02:37:33.615 --> 02:37:35.445
TALIESIN: "That was a rough pull."

02:37:35.445 --> 02:37:37.062
LAURA: Yeah, dude. It was.

02:37:37.062 --> 02:37:45.654
TALIESIN: "But everything has a price and so for
that, swords. Swords are about knowledge. So what

02:37:45.654 --> 02:37:47.095
"do you want to know?"

02:37:47.095 --> 02:37:48.789
TRAVIS: Ooh.

02:37:48.789 --> 02:37:51.491
TALIESIN: "If I can answer it, I will. I'll find
something I can answer."

02:37:51.491 --> 02:37:55.167
SAM: (whispering) The puzzle!

02:37:55.167 --> 02:38:02.380
LAURA: How do I solve the-- hmm.

02:38:02.380 --> 02:38:04.388
TALIESIN: "That's too broad."

02:38:04.388 --> 02:38:12.664
LAURA: What coincides with the picture of the head
on the puzzle?

02:38:12.664 --> 02:38:16.864
TALIESIN: Well, let me find out on my sheet.

02:38:16.864 --> 02:38:19.292
(laughter)

02:38:19.292 --> 02:38:22.276
TALIESIN: I made too many notes.

02:38:22.276 --> 02:38:27.035
LAURA: Am I still bleeding from my fingertips
creepily? All things considered though, this isn't

02:38:27.035 --> 02:38:30.241
as bad as the spider or the shattering body.

02:38:30.241 --> 02:38:33.336
LIAM: Or a horse.

02:38:33.336 --> 02:38:39.858
TALIESIN: No, you did okay. So there are--

02:38:39.858 --> 02:38:43.098
LAURA: I'm holding my hands up so I stop
bleeding.

02:38:43.098 --> 02:38:49.606
TALIESIN: Swords are about-- it's taken it.
They've closed up. The card itself gave you paper

02:38:49.606 --> 02:38:51.383
cuts and sucked everything out and then they--

02:38:51.383 --> 02:38:52.540
LAURA: I hate paper cuts.

02:38:52.540 --> 02:38:53.948
TALIESIN: Right on the fingertips, too.

02:38:53.948 --> 02:38:55.242
TRAVIS: Like a surgeon.

02:38:55.242 --> 02:38:56.470
LAURA: Yeah.

02:38:56.470 --> 02:39:02.883
TALIESIN: "Heads are knowledge. They're the base of
consciousness. You need to make an offering of

02:39:02.883 --> 02:39:08.318
"understanding. You need to find a symbol of
understanding what's happening and what you are.

02:39:08.318 --> 02:39:13.882
"You need to find something that expresses that
understanding."

02:39:13.882 --> 02:39:16.805
LAURA: That we know that we're vampires,
basically?

02:39:16.805 --> 02:39:23.621
TALIESIN: "Yes, and you have to prove it now. So
you have to find something that proves that you

02:39:23.621 --> 02:39:31.248
"know that you're vampires, something of
intellectual proof of it. Now, I might know where

02:39:31.248 --> 02:39:34.620
"something is, but that's another question."

02:39:34.620 --> 02:39:38.187
LAURA: I think I'm okay.

02:39:38.187 --> 02:39:49.734
TRAVIS: I've made my way back to the back at this
point. Hey. Hey, Ivan.

02:39:49.734 --> 02:39:51.789
LAURA: Ivan. He's made of electricity now.

02:39:51.789 --> 02:39:54.688
TRAVIS: That's fun.

02:39:54.688 --> 02:39:56.255
TALIESIN: "Things have gotten weird."

02:39:56.255 --> 02:39:57.522
TRAVIS: I gather.

02:39:57.522 --> 02:39:59.822
LAURA: Baby, I pulled a card.

02:39:59.822 --> 02:40:00.974
TRAVIS: You did?

02:40:00.974 --> 02:40:02.109
LAURA: Yeah.

02:40:02.109 --> 02:40:05.710
TALIESIN: "It made Father very happy. I think you
should pull a card, too."

02:40:05.710 --> 02:40:07.013
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:40:07.013 --> 02:40:11.245
LAURA: Okay, but you didn't see what happened with
the other cards. There was a giant--

02:40:11.245 --> 02:40:13.304
TRAVIS: How bad could it be?

02:40:13.304 --> 02:40:19.465
LAURA: Amy rotated like she was made of glass and
then shattered. Like gone.

02:40:19.465 --> 02:40:21.905
TALIESIN: "That card's only one pull, so that's
fine."

02:40:21.905 --> 02:40:25.735
LAURA: And Sam got eaten by a giant spider.

02:40:25.735 --> 02:40:27.513
TALIESIN: "The other Sam."

02:40:27.513 --> 02:40:32.522
TRAVIS: You know what, Ivan, I'm a fan of card
games. I am.

02:40:32.522 --> 02:40:33.987
TALIESIN: Have you sat down, by the way?

02:40:33.987 --> 02:40:41.737
TRAVIS: I haven't. I'm a fan of card games. I hate
to rush into anything too hastily.

02:40:41.737 --> 02:40:43.748
LAURA: I'm so hungry.

02:40:43.748 --> 02:40:50.648
TRAVIS: Yeah, you don't look so great. Maybe we'll
check out the rest of this floor real fast and

02:40:50.648 --> 02:40:53.403
then I'll come back.

02:40:53.403 --> 02:40:55.497
TALIESIN: "Hopefully I'll be here when you get
back, but fine."

02:40:55.497 --> 02:40:56.852
LAURA: Can I get up?

02:40:56.852 --> 02:40:59.572
TALIESIN: "No, I need a player."

02:40:59.572 --> 02:41:02.920
TRAVIS: Do you need us to send in Chris or
Arcade?

02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:04.722
TALIESIN: "I don't care who you send in. I just
need a player."

02:41:04.722 --> 02:41:07.689
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Sam?

02:41:07.689 --> 02:41:09.786
LIAM: We're in the bathroom, right?

02:41:09.786 --> 02:41:11.297
SAM: Me Sam?

02:41:11.297 --> 02:41:12.295
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:41:12.295 --> 02:41:14.160
SAM: Yeah, I think we're in the bathroom, right?

02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:16.312
LAURA: You just hid in the bathroom the whole
time?

02:41:16.312 --> 02:41:17.352
SAM: No, I don't know--

02:41:17.352 --> 02:41:19.780
LIAM: No, we left off of us ages-- a while back.

02:41:19.780 --> 02:41:23.474
TALIESIN: The bathrooms are sadly the bathrooms,
except more so.

02:41:23.474 --> 02:41:24.874
LIAM: There's nothing going on in the bathrooms.

02:41:24.874 --> 02:41:26.583
SAM: We didn't find anything in the walls?

02:41:26.583 --> 02:41:28.372
TALIESIN: You found some toilet paper.

02:41:28.372 --> 02:41:29.780
SAM: Anything to eat?

02:41:29.780 --> 02:41:36.006
TALIESIN: You found some toilet paper. You found
the weird little ghost that hides in the-- have

02:41:36.006 --> 02:41:40.412
you ever seen the ghost on the pipe? You can pull
that lever and see what happens.

02:41:40.412 --> 02:41:44.636
LIAM: We could keep going back around. There's
conference rooms back there now, where they keep

02:41:44.636 --> 02:41:46.473
all the games where you shot The Slayer's Cake.

02:41:46.473 --> 02:41:48.050
SAM: Yeah, let's go search.

02:41:48.050 --> 02:41:49.957
LIAM: Those dragon torches are there, too.

02:41:49.957 --> 02:41:52.826
TALIESIN: You guys are going to go check out the
library wall?

02:41:52.826 --> 02:42:01.883
SAM: As we go, I'm going to tell Liam: Listen, I
convinced Laura that I'm on her side.

02:42:01.883 --> 02:42:04.998
LIAM: Did she believe you?

02:42:04.998 --> 02:42:05.985
SAM: Totally.

02:42:05.985 --> 02:42:07.325
LIAM: Are you sure?

02:42:07.325 --> 02:42:14.345
SAM: Yes. When she goes down, she's going to try
to kick you or throw you down or trip you up, but

02:42:14.345 --> 02:42:19.275
I'm going to walk behind her, club her in the back
of the head, and we're going to make off like

02:42:19.275 --> 02:42:20.577
bandits.

02:42:20.577 --> 02:42:22.552
LIAM: I know.

02:42:22.552 --> 02:42:27.029
TALIESIN: So, are you guys going as far as the
bookcase? Are you guys going deeper in?

02:42:27.029 --> 02:42:32.481
SAM: The bookcase is literally the end of my
knowledge of the way out of the building.

02:42:32.481 --> 02:42:37.006
LIAM: I will lead Sam-- unless we see something of
note.

02:42:37.006 --> 02:42:38.929
TALIESIN: You want to take a look at the
bookcase?

02:42:38.929 --> 02:42:40.229
LIAM: Sure. Do I see anything--

02:42:40.229 --> 02:42:41.768
SAM: Is there more building past the bookcase?

02:42:41.768 --> 02:42:45.518
LIAM: There is a little bit more. There's a couple
of conference rooms. Glass doors, windows.

02:42:45.518 --> 02:42:48.686
TALIESIN: There was a map that you guys could
find, but you're never going to find it, which

02:42:48.686 --> 02:42:50.756
makes me laugh really hard. But yes, there's a--

02:42:50.756 --> 02:42:54.507
LIAM: Yeah, we're walking past these shelves of
tabletop games.

02:42:54.507 --> 02:42:58.224
TALIESIN: All right. You can do a perception
investigation.

02:42:58.224 --> 02:42:59.696
LIAM: Yeah, sure.

02:42:59.696 --> 02:43:02.377
SAM: Perception investigation.

02:43:02.377 --> 02:43:05.385
TALIESIN: Or you can use occult, if that's a
better number for you as well.

02:43:05.385 --> 02:43:06.818
SAM: I failed on a red.

02:43:06.818 --> 02:43:08.303
TALIESIN: You got a one on a red?

02:43:08.303 --> 02:43:09.217
SAM: Yes.

02:43:09.217 --> 02:43:10.984
LIAM: I also failed on a red.

02:43:10.984 --> 02:43:14.080
TALIESIN: You both failed on a red, but what was
your score total?

02:43:14.080 --> 02:43:16.624
LIAM: Two successes, one fail on a red.

02:43:16.624 --> 02:43:17.819
SAM: One success.

02:43:17.819 --> 02:43:27.792
TALIESIN: You guys, you talk about looking at the
bookshelf, but you're just talking to each other,

02:43:27.792 --> 02:43:35.901
and going back and forth talking about how foolish
Laura was to trust you. Yeah, you're just doing a

02:43:35.969 --> 02:43:38.344
bit. You just keep doing a bit.

02:43:38.344 --> 02:43:45.219
LIAM: If we get through this, we have to record
another episode of the podcast. And not one that

02:43:45.219 --> 02:43:46.555
we do at the convention, Sam--

02:43:46.555 --> 02:43:48.774
SAM: We recorded one at the convention and then I
never edited it.

02:43:48.774 --> 02:43:50.326
LIAM: You never edited it, dumbass.

02:43:50.326 --> 02:43:52.135
SAM: Man, we have it right now. It's already
done.

02:43:52.135 --> 02:43:53.461
LIAM: Yeah, we got to release that one.

02:43:53.461 --> 02:43:55.027
TALIESIN: Yuck, nope, nevermind. That didn't
happen.

02:43:55.027 --> 02:43:57.649
LIAM: There's another one. Just you and me.

02:43:57.649 --> 02:44:00.042
SAM: With some other people. Yeah, we'll do that.

02:44:00.042 --> 02:44:01.154
TRAVIS: Laura.

02:44:01.154 --> 02:44:02.098
LAURA: What?

02:44:02.098 --> 02:44:04.788
TRAVIS: Why don't you stand up and come with me
and we'll come back.

02:44:04.788 --> 02:44:06.497
LAURA: I can't.

02:44:06.497 --> 02:44:09.035
TALIESIN: "She can't stand up until I say so and I
need a player."

02:44:09.035 --> 02:44:10.844
TRAVIS: Is that right?

02:44:10.844 --> 02:44:12.135
LAURA: I can try.

02:44:12.135 --> 02:44:13.524
TALIESIN: "You can try and stand up."

02:44:13.524 --> 02:44:15.339
LAURA: (straining)

02:44:15.339 --> 02:44:20.163
TALIESIN: Okay, you now see what's in front of
you, once you're--

02:44:20.163 --> 02:44:21.941
SAM: Oh, god, what's going on?

02:44:21.941 --> 02:44:23.559
LAURA: I can't stand up. I'm so hungry.

02:44:23.559 --> 02:44:24.876
LIAM: She's nowhere near us.

02:44:24.876 --> 02:44:26.628
TRAVIS: Ivan's here and has electrical powers.

02:44:26.628 --> 02:44:27.726
SAM: Oh, okay.

02:44:27.726 --> 02:44:31.939
LIAM: Oh, the voided room is back here? Oh, I
didn't realize where it was.

02:44:31.939 --> 02:44:36.610
TALIESIN: I feel like I'm the only one who's
explored this entire building. There are some

02:44:36.610 --> 02:44:37.819
nooks and crannies, man.

02:44:37.819 --> 02:44:42.394
LIAM: I know what's in the actual building. I
didn't know the void was back here.

02:44:42.394 --> 02:44:45.111
TALIESIN: Spend enough time back there and it's a
real void. It's kind of intense.

02:44:45.111 --> 02:44:48.673
TRAIS: Apparently Ivan's made of electricity now
and he has a card game for us to play, but he

02:44:48.673 --> 02:44:49.994
needs players.

02:44:49.994 --> 02:44:51.605
TALIESIN: "Come sit."

02:44:51.605 --> 02:44:53.502
LAURA: Sam, you want to come play this card game?

02:44:53.502 --> 02:44:55.002
LIAM: And do what?

02:44:55.002 --> 02:44:56.733
SAM: Why can't-- looks like you're playing.

02:44:56.733 --> 02:44:58.741
TRAVIS: How many chairs are there?

02:44:58.741 --> 02:45:01.072
TALIESIN: Three. Two. Two empty chairs along with
her.

02:45:01.072 --> 02:45:03.386
TRAVIS: Of the three of us, only two others can
play.

02:45:03.386 --> 02:45:06.662
TALIESIN: "Or once I have somebody else sitting
down, somebody else can get up."

02:45:06.662 --> 02:45:08.796
LIAM: What, to fill the chairs? What kind of game
is it?

02:45:08.796 --> 02:45:13.329
TRAVIS: You draw a card. She drew a card and
learned something.

02:45:13.329 --> 02:45:15.930
LAURA: I did. I learned something about the
thing.

02:45:15.930 --> 02:45:17.771
SAM: It seems like Travis should play. He's a card
guy.

02:45:17.771 --> 02:45:20.196
LIAM: Straight up, do you think this is safe for
me?

02:45:20.196 --> 02:45:21.594
TRAVIS: I don't know.

02:45:21.594 --> 02:45:24.662
TALIESIN: "Is anything safe? I mean, come on,
people."

02:45:24.662 --> 02:45:27.104
LIAM: What do you feel? For me, I mean.

02:45:27.104 --> 02:45:33.173
TRAVIS: Given my general feeling of our
environment, I think almost all this shit's fucked up.

02:45:33.173 --> 02:45:34.426
LIAM: Okay.

02:45:34.426 --> 02:45:37.613
TRAVIS: Just a fair bit of sprinkling of that,
just about everywhere I look.

02:45:37.613 --> 02:45:39.624
SAM: Can we find someone else to play this game?

02:45:39.624 --> 02:45:41.909
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think so.

02:45:41.909 --> 02:45:45.064
SAM: Why don't we go find somebody else to play
this game? Are there any others?

02:45:45.064 --> 02:45:47.972
TRAVIS: That's a good idea? Actually, Sam, why
don't you go snag--?

02:45:47.972 --> 02:45:49.473
LIAM: Dani?

02:45:49.473 --> 02:45:50.729
TRAVIS: Max?

02:45:50.729 --> 02:45:52.766
LAURA: Did we see Max yet?

02:45:52.766 --> 02:45:54.026
SAM: Where's Max?

02:45:54.026 --> 02:45:58.566
TRAVIS: Max is back in the office. He's wearing a
Drink Me sign. Why don't you go snag Max?

02:45:58.566 --> 02:46:01.510
SAM: All right, if I'm not back in 30 seconds...

02:46:01.510 --> 02:46:03.155
LAURA: That's a long walk.

02:46:03.155 --> 02:46:05.460
TALIESIN: Are you going to walk or are you going
to jog?

02:46:05.460 --> 02:46:06.615
SAM: I'll run.

02:46:06.615 --> 02:46:09.753
TALIESIN: All right, well done, you. You go really
fast.

02:46:09.753 --> 02:46:11.347
TRAVIS: Oh, two of them?

02:46:11.347 --> 02:46:12.497
LAURA: You have a power!

02:46:12.497 --> 02:46:14.841
SAM: I have a power. What's my power?

02:46:14.841 --> 02:46:16.417
TALIESIN: You go really fast.

02:46:16.417 --> 02:46:17.962
LAURA: Whoa.

02:46:17.962 --> 02:46:20.768
SAM: Celerity.

02:46:20.768 --> 02:46:22.174
LIAM: Is he a speedster now?

02:46:22.174 --> 02:46:25.719
SAM: Your body responds so quickly that the world
around you seems to slow down.

02:46:25.719 --> 02:46:27.823
ALL: Whoa.

02:46:27.823 --> 02:46:31.606
TALIESIN: I was really hoping you were going to
try and hit Arcade at some point and there was

02:46:31.606 --> 02:46:34.327
just going to be a fwap! But no, you were so
nice.

02:46:34.327 --> 02:46:43.122
SAM: Oh wow. I go all over the place. Okay. All
right, so I'm going to run back there.

02:46:43.122 --> 02:46:47.885
TALIESIN: If we burn that blood, you are back in
seconds with Max. He doesn't even really quite

02:46:47.885 --> 02:46:49.865
register what happened.

02:46:49.865 --> 02:46:51.568
SAM: Burn that blood. What do I do? What's--

02:46:51.568 --> 02:46:53.214
TALIESIN: You just have an extra blood die now.

02:46:53.214 --> 02:46:55.574
LAURA: Max! Come sit down!

02:46:55.574 --> 02:47:00.805
TALIESIN: He is at the point where he is just
going to do what he's told, so he sits down.

02:47:00.805 --> 02:47:02.477
TRAVIS: Max, sit down at the table.

02:47:02.477 --> 02:47:05.236
LAURA: Yeah. Can I get up?

02:47:05.236 --> 02:47:06.423
TALIESIN: Yeah, you can get up.

02:47:06.423 --> 02:47:07.648
LAURA: I get up.

02:47:07.648 --> 02:47:10.779
TRAVIS: Now, before we leave, I would like to see
a card drawn.

02:47:10.779 --> 02:47:13.571
LAURA: Oh, okay. Max can pull one, then.

02:47:13.571 --> 02:47:16.672
TRAVIS: Yeah, Max, pull a card.

02:47:16.672 --> 02:47:23.861
TALIESIN: This is my best Max face. I don't know
how well it's coming out.

02:47:23.861 --> 02:47:26.611
(laughter)

02:47:26.611 --> 02:47:39.389
TALIESIN: Max jolts and has a weird clarity to him
for the first time in-- it seems like his eyes

02:47:39.389 --> 02:47:46.464
unpuffen and he just looks like a normal--
moisture comes back to his face and he looks

02:47:46.464 --> 02:48:00.643
slightly healthier and he's got a moment of, "We've
got to get out of here before that thing upstairs

02:48:00.643 --> 02:48:01.835
"comes down."

02:48:01.835 --> 02:48:03.399
TRAVIS: What's upstairs, Max?

02:48:03.399 --> 02:48:13.503
TALIESIN: "It's this creature. It's just teeth and
claws and I'm not going to say wolf, but there's

02:48:13.503 --> 02:48:16.438
"something up there that's big and--"

02:48:16.438 --> 02:48:18.058
TRAVIS: Beast-like?

02:48:18.058 --> 02:48:23.042
TALIESIN: "It's been a lot. There's been a lot
that's happened."

02:48:23.042 --> 02:48:28.016
TRAVIS: Max, the last thing we remember is leaving
after the last game. How long have you been here?

02:48:28.016 --> 02:48:34.650
TALIESIN: "After the last game? That's the last
thing you--" (sighs)

02:48:34.650 --> 02:48:40.068
LAURA: Max, what happened? How long has it been?

02:48:40.068 --> 02:48:41.821
TALIESIN: "It's been a long week."

02:48:41.821 --> 02:48:43.786
LAURA: It's been a whole week?

02:48:43.786 --> 02:48:45.527
SAM: Is it Thursday again?

02:48:45.527 --> 02:48:54.495
TALIESIN: "I haven't seen the sun in three days,
four days? I don't know what-- no one knows what's

02:48:54.495 --> 02:48:58.424
"going on. Things have gotten very weird, but
you've got to get us out of here."

02:48:58.424 --> 02:49:00.341
LAURA: Do people in the outside world know what's
happening?

02:49:00.341 --> 02:49:03.547
TRAVIS: When I look at Ivan, does he look
disappointed or pleased with the outcome of this

02:49:03.547 --> 02:49:04.568
card pull?

02:49:04.568 --> 02:49:07.555
TALIESIN: He's waiting for another player.

02:49:07.555 --> 02:49:10.956
TRAVIS: All right, Max, come with us.

02:49:10.956 --> 02:49:12.600
TALIESIN: "I can't get up."

02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:20.555
TRAVIS: I thought that might be happening. Yeah.
I'll tell you what, Max, sit tight. We'll be back

02:49:20.555 --> 02:49:23.934
for you. Ivan, we'll try and find you another
player.

02:49:23.934 --> 02:49:29.874
TALIESIN: "I, and I'll say, if you wanted to see
if you can figure out a little bit more about

02:49:29.874 --> 02:49:33.054
"what's happening, can't win if you don't play."

02:49:33.054 --> 02:49:35.974
TRAVIS: I mean, he has a good point.

02:49:35.974 --> 02:49:36.894
SAM: Yeah.

02:49:36.894 --> 02:49:38.173
LAURA: That's true.

02:49:38.173 --> 02:49:43.877
TALIESIN: "Max, you want to pick another card?"

02:49:43.877 --> 02:49:47.604
TRAVIS: Tell him to pick another card.

02:49:47.604 --> 02:49:50.095
SAM: Make Max do it? No, we need to do it, so we
know.

02:49:50.095 --> 02:49:52.855
TRAVIS: You're right. You're right, Sam.

02:49:52.855 --> 02:49:54.339
SAM: You want me to do it?

02:49:54.339 --> 02:49:57.118
TRAVIS: I mean, you had the inspiration. One of us
should pick a card.

02:49:57.118 --> 02:49:59.114
LAURA: You should do it.

02:49:59.114 --> 02:50:00.345
TRAVIS: It's you.

02:50:00.345 --> 02:50:02.044
LIAM: You're certainly the most clever person at
the table.

02:50:02.044 --> 02:50:03.629
LAURA: Yeah, you'll be able to solve it.

02:50:03.629 --> 02:50:06.020
SAM: If I sit down though, will I be able to get
up again?

02:50:06.020 --> 02:50:07.505
TRAVIS: Yeah, as long as Max is at the table.

02:50:07.505 --> 02:50:09.337
TALIESIN: As long as Max doesn't get up.

02:50:09.337 --> 02:50:11.551
SAM: All right. I'll draw a card.

02:50:11.551 --> 02:50:13.280
TALIESIN: Sit down. Draw a card.

02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:15.879
SAM: What could possibly go wrong?

02:50:15.879 --> 02:50:17.746
LIAM: It can only go right.

02:50:17.746 --> 02:50:21.145
LAURA: What'd you get, what'd you get?

02:50:21.145 --> 02:50:26.148
SAM: The three of swords. More blood?

02:50:26.148 --> 02:50:28.259
LAURA: Three bloods?

02:50:28.259 --> 02:50:29.713
TALIESIN: Yeah, what are you at?

02:50:29.713 --> 02:50:31.431
SAM: I'm at three.

02:50:31.431 --> 02:50:33.257
LAURA: You have three bloods already?

02:50:33.257 --> 02:50:35.837
LIAM: Uh-oh. Spaghetti-Oh.

02:50:35.837 --> 02:50:40.477
LAURA: Oh no. You've maxed out your hunger.

02:50:40.477 --> 02:50:50.618
TALIESIN: You stand up. Actually, I'm not even
going to bother with this. Ooh. Yeah, that's--

02:50:50.618 --> 02:51:04.936
okay. You, at a speed that no one can even grasp,
you stand up, there's a blur, and before anyone

02:51:04.936 --> 02:51:13.821
can notice, you are at zero health. You are fine.
Give me all your blood dice. Your blood is at zero.

02:51:13.821 --> 02:51:15.351
LIAM: You're not hungry any more.

02:51:15.351 --> 02:51:16.698
TALIESIN: You're not hungry at all.

02:51:16.698 --> 02:51:17.719
LIAM: At all?

02:51:17.719 --> 02:51:18.744
SAM: What happened?

02:51:18.744 --> 02:51:19.901
TALIESIN: You're not hungry.

02:51:19.901 --> 02:51:21.901
TRAVIS: How does Max look?

02:51:21.901 --> 02:51:24.726
TALIESIN: Max is very pale, and he's not moving.

02:51:24.726 --> 02:51:26.499
LAURA: (gasps) You killed Max.

02:51:26.499 --> 02:51:27.672
TRAVIS: You're fast as shit.

02:51:27.672 --> 02:51:29.441
LAURA: Sam, you killed Max!

02:51:29.441 --> 02:51:32.760
TRAVIS: Can I run over to Max and check his pulse
with my fingers on his carotid?

02:51:32.760 --> 02:51:37.767
TALIESIN: The only reason Max isn't slumping over
is he's still glued to the seat.

02:51:37.767 --> 02:51:42.922
SAM: (gruffly) I don't know what came over me.

02:51:42.922 --> 02:51:45.004
TALIESIN: Max is dead.

02:51:45.004 --> 02:51:47.897
LAURA: I'm going to take my dagger and try to stab
Ivan while he's distracted with all of that.

02:51:47.897 --> 02:51:52.379
SAM: (yelling) It's on! Wait, I get a question, I
get a question first!

02:51:52.379 --> 02:51:56.224
TRAVIS: We were going to get fucking knowledge
first! We were supposed to get knowledge!

02:51:56.224 --> 02:51:58.413
TALIESIN: You go in and try and stab Ivan?

02:51:58.413 --> 02:51:59.734
LAURA: I'm going to try to stab Ivan!

02:51:59.734 --> 02:52:01.608
TALIESIN: All right. Let's do dex plus--

02:52:01.608 --> 02:52:03.671
TRAVIS: Max died for nothing!

02:52:03.671 --> 02:52:05.702
LAURA: He would have let you die! He wouldn't let
you leave!

02:52:05.702 --> 02:52:07.317
SAM: What?

02:52:07.317 --> 02:52:08.609
LAURA: You would have been stuck here forever!

02:52:08.609 --> 02:52:10.375
LIAM: But we could have used him and gotten an
answer.

02:52:10.375 --> 02:52:12.057
TRAVIS: He was already up out of the chair.

02:52:12.057 --> 02:52:14.608
TALIESIN: You still get a question. We'll see how
it goes. Dex plus melee.

02:52:14.608 --> 02:52:15.838
LAURA: Dex plus melee?

02:52:15.838 --> 02:52:16.807
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:52:16.807 --> 02:52:17.957
LAURA: Melee, not brawl?

02:52:17.957 --> 02:52:19.401
TALIESIN: No, you have a weapon.

02:52:19.401 --> 02:52:20.442
TRAVIS: You do.

02:52:20.442 --> 02:52:22.679
LAURA: Oh, really? That's so dumb.

02:52:22.679 --> 02:52:24.538
TALIESIN: Yeah, take it.

02:52:24.538 --> 02:52:26.313
LAURA: I didn't know that's what it meant.

02:52:26.313 --> 02:52:30.146
TALIESIN: I'll tell you what. What's your level
two power?

02:52:30.146 --> 02:52:32.514
LAURA: Obfuscate. Unseen presence.

02:52:32.514 --> 02:52:34.143
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right. You're obfuscate.
Never mind.

02:52:34.143 --> 02:52:35.964
LAURA: I could have done it before he realized
what I was doing.

02:52:35.964 --> 02:52:39.675
TALIESIN: No. You can take a stab. See how it
goes.

02:52:39.675 --> 02:52:42.319
LAURA: Cool. What? Strength plus melee?

02:52:42.319 --> 02:52:43.852
TALIESIN: I'm letting you do dex melee.

02:52:43.852 --> 02:52:45.937
TRAVIS: I like the impulse to violence.

02:52:45.937 --> 02:52:47.082
TALIESIN: I love it.

02:52:47.082 --> 02:52:51.188
SAM: But you know why she's doing this? It's
because we made a pact to stick together. She's

02:52:51.188 --> 02:52:52.353
protecting me.

02:52:52.353 --> 02:52:58.266
LAURA: That's definitely why I'm doing it, Sam.
Ooh! Three successes and a crit! Well, just one

02:52:58.266 --> 02:53:01.910
ten. Not technically a crit, but all three were
successes.

02:53:01.910 --> 02:53:07.001
LIAM: (singing) Shot to the heart, and you're too
late.

02:53:07.001 --> 02:53:08.918
LAURA: God! That's so many dice.

02:53:08.918 --> 02:53:15.656
TALIESIN: Three successes and crit? Two successes
and a crit. Okay. So I'm going to give you

02:53:15.656 --> 02:53:23.949
success with point. You pin him with the blade to
the table.

02:53:23.949 --> 02:53:25.442
LAURA: Oh, shit!

02:53:25.442 --> 02:53:30.079
TALIESIN: "That's uncalled for."

02:53:30.079 --> 02:53:34.688
LAURA: Well, you just seemed like you were
probably kind of mean.

02:53:34.688 --> 02:53:39.639
TALIESIN: "This is really-- this is a lot. This is
a lot."

02:53:39.639 --> 02:53:42.249
LAURA: I don't know what's going on, Ivan. I'm
sorry.

02:53:42.249 --> 02:53:43.647
TRAVIS: Is he bleeding profusely?

02:53:43.647 --> 02:53:44.727
TALIESIN: No.

02:53:44.727 --> 02:53:46.825
LIAM: Is he bleeding at all?

02:53:46.825 --> 02:53:47.905
TALIESIN: No.

02:53:47.905 --> 02:53:50.144
TRAVIS: You know what they say about shit that
doesn't bleed.

02:53:50.144 --> 02:53:52.949
TALIESIN: He's stuck to the chair, though.

02:53:52.949 --> 02:53:55.655
LAURA: Yeah, well, at least maybe, Sam, ask your
question.

02:53:55.655 --> 02:53:59.929
TALIESIN: "I feel like there's things that need to
be addressed before we get to a question. I want

02:53:59.929 --> 02:54:01.441
"to play the game as much as anybody, but--"

02:54:01.441 --> 02:54:05.477
LAURA: I mean, I'm just saying. The game is still
going on. I totally interrupted the game. You

02:54:05.477 --> 02:54:08.419
know, we should just-- I just try to hold him on
to the chair. I'm just going to keep holding on.

02:54:08.419 --> 02:54:10.735
TALIESIN: "No, can you help with this? This is a
lot."

02:54:10.735 --> 02:54:13.635
LAURA: Yeah, no, I'm trying to let you go, but I'm
definitely trying to keep him in the chair. I'm

02:54:13.635 --> 02:54:16.949
trying to let it-- you're not coming off of it.

02:54:16.949 --> 02:54:19.038
TALIESIN: "These prop replicas are really well
made. This is not--"

02:54:19.038 --> 02:54:21.815
SAM: Can I get off the chair that I'm on or no?

02:54:21.815 --> 02:54:24.888
TALIESIN: Weirdly, the corpse is making it
possible at the moment.

02:54:24.888 --> 02:54:30.818
SAM: Oh, okay. I'll stay there so we can ask our
questions or whatever.

02:54:30.818 --> 02:54:32.218
LAURA: (whispering) Ask your question, quick.

02:54:32.218 --> 02:54:34.882
SAM: Oh, yes, my question! Can we--

02:54:34.882 --> 02:54:38.080
TRAVIS: Ivan, my wife is very careful about these
things.

02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:43.186
TALIESIN: "I understand this has been a very
stressful time for everybody, but let's--"

02:54:43.186 --> 02:54:44.639
SAM: I just killed Max.

02:54:44.639 --> 02:54:46.015
TALIESIN: "Yeah, you did."

02:54:46.015 --> 02:54:47.782
SAM: It's super stressful.

02:54:47.782 --> 02:54:49.104
TALIESIN: "That wasn't cool."

02:54:49.104 --> 02:54:50.083
SAM: Sorry.

02:54:50.083 --> 02:54:54.422
TALIESIN: "That was really uncalled for. Like,
it's all fun and games, sure, and we poke you a

02:54:54.422 --> 02:55:00.362
"little bit here. I'm going to poke you, but come
on! Jeez."

02:55:00.362 --> 02:55:04.416
LIAM: I'm going to come up behind Laura and press
into her elbow and I'll press the blade in and use

02:55:04.416 --> 02:55:10.368
Awe again and say: Ivan, I mean it's really all
about leverage, right? We need some information

02:55:10.368 --> 02:55:13.507
and I feel like we've earned it.

02:55:13.507 --> 02:55:15.361
TALIESIN: What's the roll for that?

02:55:15.361 --> 02:55:16.859
LIAM: Charisma plus persuasion.

02:55:16.859 --> 02:55:18.746
TALIESIN: This is going to be interesting. Is it
versus anything?

02:55:18.746 --> 02:55:19.898
LIAM: No.

02:55:19.898 --> 02:55:21.475
TALIESIN: Okay, charisma persuasion.

02:55:21.475 --> 02:55:25.929
LAURA: Doesn't he have to take a hunger dice for
it?

02:55:25.929 --> 02:55:27.303
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, he's going to take a hunger
die.

02:55:27.303 --> 02:55:28.955
TRAVIS: You try to screw over your--

02:55:28.955 --> 02:55:30.873
LAURA: I know, I'm sorry.

02:55:30.873 --> 02:55:33.144
TALIESIN: Old habits, man.

02:55:33.144 --> 02:55:35.384
LAURA: I'm really bad.

02:55:35.384 --> 02:55:40.870
LIAM: Charisma plus persuasion and one hunger die.
All right, what do we got here? Nice.

02:55:40.870 --> 02:55:44.684
LAURA: You just got to kill someone in order
to--

02:55:44.684 --> 02:55:46.864
LIAM: I've got two successes.

02:55:46.864 --> 02:55:51.082
TALIESIN: Oh. Yeah, he critted against you.

02:55:51.082 --> 02:55:52.866
LIAM: Oh, that didn't work.

02:55:52.866 --> 02:55:55.097
TALIESIN: That didn't work, but you're still going
to take your hunger die.

02:55:55.097 --> 02:55:56.777
LIAM: Yeah, all right.

02:55:56.777 --> 02:56:07.661
TALIESIN: "Come on, that's just not necessary.
What do you need to know?"

02:56:07.661 --> 02:56:09.427
LAURA: What do you need to know?

02:56:09.427 --> 02:56:12.117
TALIESIN: "Let's just deal with this."

02:56:12.117 --> 02:56:18.785
SAM: What did we find out so far?

02:56:18.785 --> 02:56:24.881
LAURA: We found that in order for the head to be
unlocked, we have to put something on it that

02:56:24.881 --> 02:56:26.677
proves we know we're vampires.

02:56:26.677 --> 02:56:27.778
SAM: What about the cross?

02:56:27.778 --> 02:56:29.151
LAURA: We don't know that one yet.

02:56:29.151 --> 02:56:32.842
SAM: What do we need to overcome the cross part of
the puzzle?

02:56:32.842 --> 02:56:37.899
TALIESIN: "It's a sign of faith. Any kind of sign
of faith. God, that one should be obvious. You

02:56:37.899 --> 02:56:45.928
"need some sort of sign of faith. There's a dozen
answers to that one. That one's the easy one. I

02:56:45.928 --> 02:56:48.797
"mean, oh god, okay, that's, wow."

02:56:48.797 --> 02:56:50.138
LAURA: Does it hurt?

02:56:50.138 --> 02:56:52.427
TALIESIN: "What do you think? Does it look
like--?"

02:56:52.427 --> 02:56:55.028
LAURA: It doesn't look like you're in a lot of
pain, I can't tell.

02:56:55.028 --> 02:57:00.688
TALIESIN: "I'm upset. I'm angry. I didn't mean to
take it out on you. Actually, you stabbed me, I

02:57:00.688 --> 02:57:02.448
"think you get a little bit of this."

02:57:02.448 --> 02:57:04.343
LAURA: Yeah. Sorry, Ivan.

02:57:04.343 --> 02:57:06.755
TRAVIS: Ivan are you like us?

02:57:06.755 --> 02:57:12.007
TALIESIN: "I mean, I think of myself as a very
good roleplayer, so I'd like to think that."

02:57:12.007 --> 02:57:14.347
SAM: Are you a vampire?

02:57:14.347 --> 02:57:15.893
TALIESIN: "No."

02:57:15.893 --> 02:57:17.354
LAURA: What are you?

02:57:17.354 --> 02:57:24.831
TALIESIN: "Just me! I'm just clever and I want the
best game possible!"

02:57:24.831 --> 02:57:26.238
LAURA: What's upstairs?

02:57:26.238 --> 02:57:29.691
TALIESIN: "That's a pull."

02:57:29.691 --> 02:57:35.329
TRAVIS: Can I go over to Max's corpse and pat down
his pockets to see if he's carrying anything cool?

02:57:35.329 --> 02:57:37.040
TALIESIN: He's not carrying anything cool.

02:57:37.040 --> 02:57:38.092
TRAVIS: Damn it, Max.

02:57:38.092 --> 02:57:40.196
LIAM: You think we're at Burning Man right now,
don't you?

02:57:40.196 --> 02:57:45.827
LAURA: I'm going to pull my dagger out of him, I
guess.

02:57:45.827 --> 02:57:50.523
TALIESIN: It pops out, there's a little electric
flash, a few spiders crawl out.

02:57:50.523 --> 02:57:52.692
(groaning)

02:57:52.692 --> 02:57:55.132
TALIESIN: "Don't mind that; it's mostly flair."

02:57:55.132 --> 02:58:00.542
TRAVIS: So aside from upstairs, we know pretty
much everything.

02:58:00.542 --> 02:58:04.719
TALIESIN: "You guys have everything you need,
let's be serious here. If you really want to know

02:58:04.719 --> 02:58:10.935
"another clue, I'd tell you that you've got a
cross, you've got the head. You need something

02:58:10.935 --> 02:58:21.007
"cerebral, something grand, and you need something
of faith."

02:58:21.007 --> 02:58:22.483
LAURA: Okay, yeah!

02:58:22.483 --> 02:58:27.448
TALIESIN: "And I'd do it soon if I were you. The
sun's setting."

02:58:27.448 --> 02:58:30.494
SAM: The sun's setting? That's a good thing,
though, that means we can go outside.

02:58:30.494 --> 02:58:33.222
TALIESIN: "Yeah, and also means other things can
come in."

02:58:33.222 --> 02:58:35.524
LAURA: Come in?

02:58:35.524 --> 02:58:42.699
TALIESIN: "Let's remind you that if you see
anybody, the table's open, and I'd really like

02:58:42.699 --> 02:58:44.356
"some new players."

02:58:44.356 --> 02:58:46.946
LAURA: You got it. Sorry about the stabbing.

02:58:46.946 --> 02:58:50.041
TALIESIN: "It happens."

02:58:50.041 --> 02:58:54.718
SAM: We'll send some more players down here.
Thanks for your cooperation.

02:58:54.718 --> 02:58:56.028
TALIESIN: "Thank you for playing."

02:58:56.028 --> 02:58:59.033
TRAVIS: I make my way out of that room.

02:58:59.033 --> 02:59:00.545
LAURA: Ditto, quickly.

02:59:00.545 --> 02:59:08.502
TALIESIN: You come out, you pass the war room, the
meeting room, you pass the bookshelf.

02:59:08.502 --> 02:59:10.602
LAURA: Did I see anything cool on the
bookshelves?

02:59:10.602 --> 02:59:12.145
TALIESIN: Did you look in the bookshelf?

02:59:12.145 --> 02:59:13.272
LIAM: You didn't.

02:59:13.272 --> 02:59:14.286
LAURA: I didn't.

02:59:14.286 --> 02:59:20.017
TALIESIN: Take a perception investigation or
perception occult.

02:59:20.017 --> 02:59:21.717
TRAVIS: Occult?

02:59:21.717 --> 02:59:24.665
TALIESIN: Yeah, whichever one strikes your fancy.

02:59:24.665 --> 02:59:27.440
LIAM: Hail Satan!

02:59:27.440 --> 02:59:29.544
SAM: Liam, did you see how fast I was?

02:59:29.544 --> 02:59:31.457
LIAM: I didn't see you!

02:59:31.457 --> 02:59:33.018
TRAVIS: Two successes.

02:59:33.018 --> 02:59:36.326
TALIESIN: There's some cool shit in the cage,
man.

02:59:36.326 --> 02:59:38.090
LAURA: Four successes!

02:59:38.090 --> 02:59:41.018
TALIESIN: Four successes? There's some cool shit
in the cage.

02:59:41.018 --> 02:59:42.681
LAURA: Five successes.

02:59:42.681 --> 02:59:48.273
TALIESIN: What's in the cage? Where's my cage?
There's some stakes, there's a cross in the cage.

02:59:48.273 --> 02:59:49.935
LAURA: Ooh, get that cross!

02:59:49.935 --> 02:59:52.663
TALIESIN: You, on the other hand, with four
successes--

02:59:52.663 --> 02:59:53.790
LAURA: Five.

02:59:53.790 --> 02:59:56.155
TALIESIN: Five? Well, four was the--

02:59:56.155 --> 02:59:57.502
TRAVIS: What you needed.

02:59:57.502 --> 03:00:05.096
TALIESIN: There's a very old-looking book on the
top shelf that you don't recall seeing there

03:00:05.096 --> 03:00:11.621
before. It's a small, black leather book with a
little bit of silver on it, and you can't make it

03:00:11.621 --> 03:00:14.321
out, but there's something about it.

03:00:14.321 --> 03:00:17.624
LAURA: I climb the shelves to get up to it.

03:00:17.624 --> 03:00:20.649
TRAVIS: I'll take the cage and open it up. There's
a steak in there?

03:00:20.649 --> 03:00:24.008
TALIESIN: They've got a bunch of props from the
last run--

03:00:24.008 --> 03:00:27.634
TRAVIS: Is it a real steak or a rubber steak?

03:00:27.634 --> 03:00:32.484
TALIESIN: It's Sagas of Sundry, and it's us, so
it's much cheaper for us to use real stakes. A

03:00:32.484 --> 03:00:34.397
rubber stake, a rubber chicken.

03:00:34.397 --> 03:00:37.578
LIAM and TALIESIN: Chattering teeth.

03:00:37.578 --> 03:00:41.624
TRAVIS: I was going, "meat steak?"

03:00:41.624 --> 03:00:44.826
SAM: Just a big T-bone, sitting there in a cage.

03:00:44.826 --> 03:00:46.746
LIAM: We are in a Looney Tunes.

03:00:46.746 --> 03:00:48.909
TRAVIS: I will take that stake, and I will also
take--

03:00:48.980 --> 03:00:50.251
LIAM: A cross in there.

03:00:50.251 --> 03:00:51.715
TALIESIN: There's a cross.

03:00:51.715 --> 03:00:52.562
LAURA: Take the cross.

03:00:52.562 --> 03:00:57.310
TRAVIS: Wait, can I take my shirt off--

03:00:57.310 --> 03:00:59.513
TALIESIN, LIAM, and SAM: Always.

03:00:59.513 --> 03:01:02.642
TRAVIS: And can I throw the shirt over the cross
to try and pick it up?

03:01:02.642 --> 03:01:03.791
TALIESIN: Yes, you can.

03:01:03.791 --> 03:01:05.233
SAM: Oh, he's a vampire.

03:01:05.233 --> 03:01:06.958
TALIESIN: Clever. Interesting.

03:01:06.958 --> 03:01:10.317
LAURA: Smart. He knows all these vampire things
because he watches werewolf movies, and vampires

03:01:10.317 --> 03:01:11.615
attack them.

03:01:11.615 --> 03:01:13.352
LIAM: I thought he was scared of scary stuff?

03:01:13.352 --> 03:01:16.419
LAURA: No, he's into it. He's scared of ghosts.

03:01:16.419 --> 03:01:20.335
SAM: He's seen The Lost Boys. I know that's true.

03:01:20.335 --> 03:01:23.216
TALIESIN: You can't tell if it felt weird because
it felt weird, or felt weird because you expected

03:01:23.216 --> 03:01:24.437
it to feel weird.

03:01:24.437 --> 03:01:30.409
TRAVIS: Yeah. When my shirt is off, does my skin
sparkle at all?

03:01:30.409 --> 03:01:44.172
TALIESIN: No more than normal. That body glitter,
it's nuts. There's a book, and it's a small, black

03:01:44.172 --> 03:01:45.291
leather book.

03:01:45.291 --> 03:01:46.564
LAURA: What does it have in it?

03:01:46.564 --> 03:01:50.835
TALIESIN: On the cover is a skull with fangs.

03:01:50.835 --> 03:01:53.006
LAURA: Hey, I bet this is a thing!

03:01:53.006 --> 03:01:54.554
LIAM: It's a death note!

03:01:54.554 --> 03:01:59.508
LAURA: Skull book. Does it tell me how to be a
vampire?

03:01:59.508 --> 03:02:05.676
TALIESIN: You open it up, and it is entitled, "The
Telling of the Book of Nod."

03:02:05.676 --> 03:02:07.348
TRAVIS: Oh god.

03:02:07.348 --> 03:02:08.826
SAM: What's that?

03:02:08.826 --> 03:02:14.576
TALIESIN: It's prose, and it's long, and it's hard
to read because it's been hand-inked, but there

03:02:14.576 --> 03:02:21.021
seems to be a lot of interesting information here
about vampires, and about what they can do and who

03:02:21.021 --> 03:02:22.229
they are.

03:02:22.229 --> 03:02:24.159
LAURA: Do I learn anything cool about myself?

03:02:24.159 --> 03:02:25.634
LIAM: Step one: Eat bloods.

03:02:25.634 --> 03:02:27.580
TALIESIN: You can peruse it for a second.

03:02:27.580 --> 03:02:28.750
LAURA: Yeah, I want to peruse it.

03:02:28.750 --> 03:02:37.828
TALIESIN: Actually, let's do a fun one. Roll wits
linguistics, just because I'm a jerk.

03:02:37.828 --> 03:02:39.555
LAURA: Wits and linguistics?

03:02:39.555 --> 03:02:44.597
TALIESIN: Yeah, because it's a little weird, and
it's in old English. It's all left. See, you're

03:02:44.597 --> 03:02:53.962
getting it. Thank you. That mouse skeleton is very
fetching, by the way. I like sitting here.

03:02:53.962 --> 03:02:57.600
TRAVIS: You look handsomer.

03:02:57.600 --> 03:02:59.778
LAURA: I shouldn't have said it was cocked!

03:02:59.778 --> 03:03:02.090
LIAM: She rolled a cocked dice and got another
failure.

03:03:02.090 --> 03:03:03.090
SAM: Two failures?

03:03:03.090 --> 03:03:04.112
LIAM: Two failures.

03:03:04.112 --> 03:03:05.243
SAM: Both red.

03:03:05.243 --> 03:03:07.860
LIAM: One success. Both red. Two failures.

03:03:07.860 --> 03:03:11.924
TALIESIN: How much hunger are you at right now?

03:03:11.924 --> 03:03:13.359
LAURA: I'm at three hunger.

03:03:13.359 --> 03:03:25.609
TALIESIN: Okay. Oh, good. You keep hitting three
hunger. Yeah, you read it, and there was something

03:03:25.609 --> 03:03:33.863
about your power, but you couldn't absorb any of
the information. You actually are having a hard

03:03:33.863 --> 03:03:36.141
time reading, thinking.

03:03:36.141 --> 03:03:41.204
LAURA: I really need some food. You had to drink
all of Max's blood?

03:03:41.204 --> 03:03:42.533
SAM: It was so good.

03:03:42.533 --> 03:03:44.873
TALIESIN: You are not hungry right now, by the
way.

03:03:44.873 --> 03:03:46.404
SAM: It was so &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt;!

03:03:46.404 --> 03:03:47.719
LAURA: I'm so hungry.

03:03:47.719 --> 03:03:51.867
SAM: It was like a Brunello di Montalcino wine.

03:03:51.867 --> 03:03:56.238
TALIESIN: At the moment, you're down three on
academics, occult, or lore.

03:03:56.238 --> 03:03:57.595
LAURA: Oh god.

03:03:57.595 --> 03:03:59.517
TALIESIN: That's gone until you eat.

03:03:59.517 --> 03:04:02.122
LAURA: I'm down three, so I'm minus one on
academics?

03:04:02.122 --> 03:04:03.543
TALIESIN: There's no minus. It's just nothing.

03:04:03.543 --> 03:04:08.001
TRAVIS: Does she gain an additional blood die, or
anything?

03:04:08.001 --> 03:04:14.584
TALIESIN: Not for that one, because she did okay.
Good for checking. You got the book, and you got a

03:04:14.584 --> 03:04:16.056
couple of things.

03:04:16.056 --> 03:04:18.102
TRAVIS: What did you find?

03:04:18.102 --> 03:04:19.674
LIAM: Nothing.

03:04:19.674 --> 03:04:22.761
SAM: Laura doesn't know how to read.

03:04:22.761 --> 03:04:24.578
TRAVIS: Babe, what did you find?

03:04:24.578 --> 03:04:25.928
LAURA: I'm so hungry.

03:04:25.928 --> 03:04:27.449
TRAVIS: But what did you find up there?

03:04:27.449 --> 03:04:28.793
LAURA: I found a book.

03:04:28.793 --> 03:04:31.234
TRAVIS: You found a book? What does it say?

03:04:31.234 --> 03:04:32.823
LAURA: I don't know. I'm so hungry.

03:04:32.823 --> 03:04:36.153
TALIESIN: You hear a little bit of noise and
chattering from out in the front, but you don't

03:04:36.153 --> 03:04:37.292
know where from.

03:04:37.292 --> 03:04:38.444
SAM: There's chattering.

03:04:38.444 --> 03:04:40.911
LAURA: Does it sound like people I could eat?

03:04:40.911 --> 03:04:45.315
SAM: Let's get our weapons out and go face this
threat head on.

03:04:45.315 --> 03:04:48.159
TRAVIS: Or we could try and solve this puzzle.

03:04:48.159 --> 03:04:51.979
LAURA: What, like I gave it to you?

03:04:51.979 --> 03:04:54.140
TALIESIN: Wits linguistics.

03:04:54.140 --> 03:04:56.624
SAM: Why don't we solve the puzzle now, Liam? We
need a symbol of faith--

03:04:56.624 --> 03:04:59.316
LAURA: And the book, I'm going to put on the
head.

03:04:59.316 --> 03:05:00.545
LIAM: Three successes.

03:05:00.545 --> 03:05:08.865
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is telling the story of
several brothers, and it's telling the story of

03:05:08.865 --> 03:05:14.936
people disavowed by god, whose souls left their
body, and several brothers who went out upon their

03:05:14.936 --> 03:05:21.641
own, and various families. It's a lot to take in.
It's going to be tough, but you're starting to get

03:05:21.641 --> 03:05:25.615
the notion that this is an old story about the
origins of vampires.

03:05:25.615 --> 03:05:30.964
LIAM: Here with the tabletop games on the wall of
board games.

03:05:30.964 --> 03:05:32.388
TALIESIN: That's weird, isn't it?

03:05:32.388 --> 03:05:34.857
LAURA: I wander out into the kitchen, looking for
somebody to eat.

03:05:34.857 --> 03:05:39.138
TALIESIN: You can listen really hard and see if
you hear anything.

03:05:39.138 --> 03:05:41.330
LAURA: I listen real hard. Do I hear anybody?

03:05:41.330 --> 03:05:53.947
TALIESIN: Let's say perception awareness. I would
start looking. I would think about willpower, at

03:05:53.947 --> 03:05:55.009
some point.

03:05:55.009 --> 03:05:56.292
LAURA: I forgot I had that.

03:05:56.292 --> 03:05:58.287
LIAM: I'm hungry, too. I'm going to help you
look.

03:05:58.287 --> 03:06:00.384
TRAVIS: Sam and I will make our way out to the
puzzle.

03:06:00.384 --> 03:06:04.988
LAURA: Ooh, that's good. Oh yeah, four successes.

03:06:04.988 --> 03:06:17.397
TALIESIN: That's really good. There's a scuttling
sound upstairs in the Smart Girls offices. In Amy

03:06:17.397 --> 03:06:20.822
Poehler's Smart Girls offices, you hear a
scuttling. A small scuttling.

03:06:20.822 --> 03:06:25.276
LAURA: I'm going to quietly walk up the stairs. I
think it's a rat.

03:06:25.276 --> 03:06:27.262
TRAVIS: Laura, where are you going? Upstairs is
dangerous.

03:06:27.262 --> 03:06:28.825
SAM: Yeah, we're about to solve the puzzle.

03:06:28.825 --> 03:06:33.589
LAURA: I need some food. I don't know where any
food is around here.

03:06:33.589 --> 03:06:37.618
TRAVIS: In case it's dangerous, why don't we try
and solve the puzzle first? See what happens.

03:06:37.618 --> 03:06:41.731
LIAM: I'm hungry, too, but could you wait for just
a minute?

03:06:41.731 --> 03:06:42.952
TRAVIS and SAM: Wait.

03:06:42.952 --> 03:06:44.363
LIAM: Just a minute.

03:06:44.363 --> 03:06:51.582
TRAVIS: I'll take the cross covered with my
t-shirt, and without touching it, dump it on the

03:06:51.582 --> 03:06:53.956
lower right-hand corner of the circle.

03:06:53.956 --> 03:06:58.563
TALIESIN: It bubbles and blackens, and the whole
thing is humming even more.

03:06:58.563 --> 03:07:05.958
LAURA: Should we use the book on the other one? Or
I could bust out one of my fangs.

03:07:05.958 --> 03:07:11.876
TRAVIS: Don't you need that to eat more disgusting
rats with?

03:07:11.876 --> 03:07:14.481
LAURA: Are you judging me now?

03:07:14.481 --> 03:07:15.761
TRAVIS: The whole time.

03:07:15.761 --> 03:07:20.524
LAURA: Have you not had any rats yet? You've had a
rat.

03:07:20.524 --> 03:07:22.881
TRAVIS: No, have you?

03:07:22.881 --> 03:07:24.459
LAURA: No, of course not.

03:07:24.459 --> 03:07:26.077
SAM: I ate a &lt;i&gt;man&lt;/i&gt;.

03:07:26.077 --> 03:07:31.579
TALIESIN: And that was all I needed from this
game. Thank you, everybody.

03:07:31.579 --> 03:07:34.978
TRAVIS: Try the book?

03:07:34.978 --> 03:07:38.512
LAURA: Okay, cool. Yeah, we should try the book.

03:07:38.512 --> 03:07:39.868
LIAM: Man, I'm hungry.

03:07:39.868 --> 03:07:41.874
LAURA: He said it's cerebral. The book is a
cerebral thing.

03:07:41.874 --> 03:07:54.705
TALIESIN: It boils and bubbles, and all the blood
burns off the door, and you hear a clank. The door

03:07:54.705 --> 03:07:56.409
may be open; it may not be.

03:07:56.409 --> 03:07:59.909
LAURA: See, I feel like I should eat before we go in
there. What if there's something bad in there?

03:07:59.909 --> 03:08:01.305
TRAVIS: Okay, fair enough.

03:08:01.305 --> 03:08:05.404
SAM: Do you want me to do my super speed and go
upstairs and see what that scuttling is?

03:08:05.404 --> 03:08:07.419
LIAM: Yeah, that's a good idea.

03:08:07.419 --> 03:08:18.652
TRAVIS: I also have a fair amount of hunger, so
between Chris, Audrey, and Arcade: should we call dibs?

03:08:18.652 --> 03:08:22.508
TALIESIN: Wow, he turned so hard so quick.

03:08:22.508 --> 03:08:24.352
SAM: You're eating them?

03:08:24.352 --> 03:08:30.202
TRAVIS: They have a sign around their neck that
says "drink me." It says "drink me."

03:08:30.202 --> 03:08:33.904
SAM: But if we beat the magic, they all come back
to life, right?

03:08:33.904 --> 03:08:37.428
TALIESIN: There is the scuttling upstairs, still,
from the Smart Girls office.

03:08:37.428 --> 03:08:40.491
LIAM: I feel like it would be good to have a
snack.

03:08:40.491 --> 03:08:42.786
LAURA: What, one rat's going to feed us all?

03:08:42.786 --> 03:08:47.125
LIAM: Guys, snack, up.

03:08:47.125 --> 03:08:50.167
TRAVIS: How about Laura checks out the scuttling?

03:08:50.167 --> 03:08:52.521
LIAM: I'm all right with that.

03:08:52.521 --> 03:08:54.584
LAURA: Why are you doing this to me?

03:08:54.584 --> 03:08:57.459
TRAVIS: Well, I just want to make sure that we're
safe.

03:08:57.459 --> 03:09:02.057
LAURA: Baby, don't you love me?

03:09:02.057 --> 03:09:05.263
TRAVIS: So much. Undying love.

03:09:05.263 --> 03:09:08.826
LIAM: Everybody knows Travis loves you. It's
obvious.

03:09:08.826 --> 03:09:12.198
TRAVIS: Yeah. Give it a look. I'll be right behind
you.

03:09:12.198 --> 03:09:13.773
SAM: I'll come with you.

03:09:13.773 --> 03:09:14.886
LAURA: Thanks, Sam.

03:09:14.886 --> 03:09:18.445
TRAVIS: Is this Warcraft sword made of silver, or
anything?

03:09:18.445 --> 03:09:30.615
TALIESIN: Probably not. Blizzard's awesome, but--
it bends a little bit, because it's steel. It's a

03:09:30.615 --> 03:09:34.882
wall-hanger. It's beautiful.

03:09:34.882 --> 03:09:39.883
LAURA: We walk upstairs quietly, stealthily. I'm
not going to use my full Unseen Presence, but I'm

03:09:39.883 --> 03:09:41.764
going to Obfuscate.

03:09:41.764 --> 03:09:45.594
TALIESIN: That one, you have to be still. You're
going to have to keep cover.

03:09:45.594 --> 03:09:49.729
TRAVIS: That was the fart, Liam.

03:09:49.729 --> 03:09:56.282
TALIESIN: Roll a d10 and tell me what you get.

03:09:56.282 --> 03:09:57.223
LAURA: Any d10?

03:09:57.223 --> 03:09:58.689
TALIESIN: Roll any d10.

03:09:58.689 --> 03:10:00.427
LAURA: Six?

03:10:00.427 --> 03:10:08.893
TALIESIN: You're fine, for the moment. There are
two people hiding underneath desks up there.

03:10:08.893 --> 03:10:10.663
LAURA: (whispering) Do they smell good?

03:10:10.663 --> 03:10:14.692
TALIESIN: They smell amazing. They smell really
good.

03:10:14.692 --> 03:10:23.476
LAURA: Wait. (quietly) Hello? Is anybody up here?

03:10:23.476 --> 03:10:29.059
TALIESIN: They peek out around the desk. It's a
guy and a girl.

03:10:29.059 --> 03:10:32.025
SAM: Do we recognize them?

03:10:32.025 --> 03:10:35.882
TALIESIN: I've been waiting for this joke all
night. It's the Smart Girls office. You have no

03:10:35.882 --> 03:10:37.265
idea who these people are.

03:10:37.265 --> 03:10:39.810
(laughter)

03:10:39.810 --> 03:10:42.161
TALIESIN: I feel so bad.

03:10:42.161 --> 03:10:53.314
LAURA: Hi. I don't know what's going on. I woke
up. There's scary things everywhere. Can we hide

03:10:53.314 --> 03:10:54.671
in here with you?

03:10:54.671 --> 03:10:57.593
TALIESIN: Make a--

03:10:57.593 --> 03:10:59.314
LAURA: Performance?

03:10:59.314 --> 03:11:01.822
TALIESIN: Yeah, give me charisma performance.

03:11:01.822 --> 03:11:03.742
TRAVIS: Are we calling that a performance?

03:11:03.742 --> 03:11:06.542
LAURA: Shut up. You're a dick.

03:11:06.542 --> 03:11:08.574
TALIESIN: She books more than me, man. I ain't
going to say shit.

03:11:08.574 --> 03:11:15.427
LAURA: See, there's so much risk every time I'm
rolling my hunger dice.

03:11:15.427 --> 03:11:16.807
TALIESIN: I know.

03:11:16.807 --> 03:11:18.271
LAURA: I don't like rolling for anything now.

03:11:18.271 --> 03:11:20.155
TALIESIN: This is my favorite part of this game.

03:11:20.155 --> 03:11:21.597
LAURA: God dang it.

03:11:21.597 --> 03:11:25.986
LIAM: That's real good stuff. That's all success.
Every single one.

03:11:25.986 --> 03:11:27.358
LAURA: Five successes.

03:11:27.358 --> 03:11:29.910
SAM: And one red fail.

03:11:29.910 --> 03:11:31.173
LAURA: One red fail.

03:11:31.173 --> 03:11:32.261
TALIESIN: One red fail is fine.

03:11:32.261 --> 03:11:33.572
LAURA: But a lot of success.

03:11:33.572 --> 03:11:44.612
TALIESIN: Yeah, the one red fail is... if you're
thinking about eating them, it's going to take you

03:11:44.612 --> 03:11:49.313
a second to get your composure. You're really
distracted, and you're having a hard time

03:11:49.313 --> 03:11:53.433
focusing, but they bring you in.

03:11:53.433 --> 03:11:58.706
LAURA: Hi. I crawl under the desk. Are they under
separate desks?

03:11:58.706 --> 03:12:00.251
TALIESIN: No, they're both underneath the same
desk.

03:12:00.251 --> 03:12:01.251
SAM: I'm coming in, too.

03:12:01.251 --> 03:12:02.353
LAURA: Oh, this is Sam.

03:12:02.353 --> 03:12:04.081
SAM: I'm a good person.

03:12:04.081 --> 03:12:09.114
TALIESIN: "Neither of us have ever seen either of
you before in our lives."

03:12:09.114 --> 03:12:11.688
SAM: I'm a fan of your boss.

03:12:11.688 --> 03:12:15.739
LAURA: I huddle up next to the girl and act like
I'm really scared, and I bite her.

03:12:15.739 --> 03:12:19.579
TALIESIN: You're going to have to make
conversation for a minute because of that one red die.

03:12:19.579 --> 03:12:23.116
LAURA: Damn it. So anyway, you guys work at Smart
Girls?

03:12:23.116 --> 03:12:25.731
TALIESIN: "We do. Actually, it's real interesting
what we do--"

03:12:25.731 --> 03:12:28.520
SAM: Are you writing something or developing
something?

03:12:28.520 --> 03:12:31.946
TALIESIN: "It's really complicated to explain, but
we do a lot of stuff--"

03:12:31.946 --> 03:12:33.267
LAURA: And then I bite her.

03:12:33.267 --> 03:12:34.419
TALIESIN: Okay, thank you.

03:12:34.419 --> 03:12:36.786
(laughter)

03:12:36.786 --> 03:12:37.765
TALIESIN: Bless you.

03:12:37.765 --> 03:12:39.579
TRAVIS: Small talk, and then business.

03:12:39.579 --> 03:12:45.634
TALIESIN: Give me dex plus two for this one.

03:12:45.634 --> 03:12:47.565
TRAVIS: Do we hear a commotion?

03:12:47.565 --> 03:12:56.203
SAM: As Laura bites, I'm going to take my XLR whip
and use it to subdue and put it around the neck of

03:12:56.203 --> 03:12:57.806
the other one. I'm not hungry.

03:12:57.806 --> 03:12:59.058
TALIESIN: Dex brawl.

03:12:59.058 --> 03:13:01.024
SAM: Dex brawl.

03:13:01.024 --> 03:13:02.516
TRAVIS: Can we hear any commotion?

03:13:02.516 --> 03:13:03.730
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. You hear thumping.

03:13:03.730 --> 03:13:07.418
LAURA: Three successes, one red fail.

03:13:07.418 --> 03:13:12.511
TALIESIN: One red fail? It works. It takes a
second. You're not having an easy time with this,

03:13:12.511 --> 03:13:13.946
but you're in there.

03:13:13.946 --> 03:13:15.229
LAURA: I'm going to hold her down.

03:13:15.229 --> 03:13:16.433
TALIESIN: How much are you draining?

03:13:16.433 --> 03:13:19.591
LAURA: Well, I've got three hunger, so a lot.

03:13:19.591 --> 03:13:24.758
TALIESIN: Are you going to try to get rid of all
three hunger? Roll a d10.

03:13:24.758 --> 03:13:27.586
TRAVIS: Don't look at us. Follow your heart.

03:13:27.586 --> 03:13:29.773
LAURA: Three.

03:13:29.773 --> 03:13:33.314
TALIESIN: Yeah. Give me all of your hunger die.

03:13:33.314 --> 03:13:36.448
LAURA: Oh god, I killed someone?

03:13:36.448 --> 03:13:42.114
TALIESIN: You killed someone who worked for Amy
Poehler, and I want you to think about that.

03:13:42.114 --> 03:13:43.639
LIAM: I bet that smarts.

03:13:43.639 --> 03:13:45.772
(groaning)

03:13:45.772 --> 03:13:47.417
LAURA: Take a hunger dice.

03:13:47.417 --> 03:13:52.224
SAM: I rolled three successes for my garrotte.

03:13:52.224 --> 03:13:54.839
TRAVIS: (laughing) For your strangulation?

03:13:54.839 --> 03:14:02.476
SAM: I'm not trying to kill. I'm just trying to
subdue. Is it a dude?

03:14:02.476 --> 03:14:03.908
TALIESIN: (strangled) It's a dude.

03:14:03.908 --> 03:14:06.262
SAM: I lift him up and march him down the stairs
for my friends.

03:14:06.262 --> 03:14:13.826
TALIESIN: Give me strength athletics on that one,
for rolling around, unless you want to burn some blood.

03:14:13.826 --> 03:14:15.172
SAM: What is it, Laura?

03:14:15.172 --> 03:14:16.489
LAURA: Don't tell anyone I killed this chick!

03:14:16.582 --> 03:14:17.782
SAM: (whispering) I won't.

03:14:17.782 --> 03:14:19.599
LAURA: Oh man.

03:14:19.599 --> 03:14:21.537
SAM: Clean your mouth.

03:14:21.537 --> 03:14:22.875
LAURA: I feel so much better.

03:14:22.875 --> 03:14:24.105
SAM: Three successes.

03:14:24.105 --> 03:14:26.607
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. You're dragging him down.

03:14:26.607 --> 03:14:29.910
SAM: Don't make a sound.

03:14:29.910 --> 03:14:32.080
LAURA: This is so dark!

03:14:32.080 --> 03:14:45.854
SAM: And I am not going to kill you. And I bring
him downstairs and throw him at Liam. Have at him!

03:14:45.854 --> 03:14:48.661
LIAM: Wow, you love me.

03:14:48.661 --> 03:14:54.826
TALIESIN: Give me dex two.

03:14:54.826 --> 03:14:56.681
LIAM: Dex two?

03:14:56.681 --> 03:15:00.508
TALIESIN: Dex plus two dice. Yeah, sorry. I'm
still figuring some of this out. I have way too

03:15:00.508 --> 03:15:01.696
many pieces of paper.

03:15:01.696 --> 03:15:03.441
LAURA: Oh no, Travis, are you still hungry?

03:15:03.441 --> 03:15:09.455
LIAM: Shit, shit! Two fails. One success, two
fails. One's a red.

03:15:09.455 --> 03:15:19.300
TALIESIN: One red fail, and--? Yeah, you go for
it, but you somehow slip and you don't quite get

03:15:19.300 --> 03:15:23.649
it together to get a good grab.

03:15:23.649 --> 03:15:26.098
LIAM: I feel so crazed!

03:15:26.098 --> 03:15:30.684
TALIESIN: Suddenly you start hearing a growling
coming from the other end of the building.

03:15:30.684 --> 03:15:33.193
(snarling)

03:15:33.193 --> 03:15:34.590
TRAVIS: From the where? Other end?

03:15:34.590 --> 03:15:36.144
LAURA: From where?

03:15:36.144 --> 03:15:37.396
TRAVIS: The front of the building?

03:15:37.396 --> 03:15:40.998
TALIESIN: From the front of the building.
(snarling)

03:15:40.998 --> 03:15:44.280
LAURA: We should get in the Twitch stage. We
should go in.

03:15:44.280 --> 03:15:56.838
TALIESIN: As you walk, there's two, probably
ten-foot tall wolves slowly making their way into

03:15:56.838 --> 03:15:57.613
the kitchen.

03:15:57.613 --> 03:15:58.996
TRAVIS: Bipedal?

03:15:58.996 --> 03:16:05.082
TALIESIN: They're quadripedic at the moment, but
it seems like there might be the option, and one

03:16:05.082 --> 03:16:09.629
of them has some brilliant tattoo work up the
front arms.

03:16:09.629 --> 03:16:14.455
LAURA: Oh my god, Rachel?! Rachel turned into a
werewolf!

03:16:14.455 --> 03:16:16.449
LIAM: It's Romero!

03:16:16.449 --> 03:16:21.086
TALIESIN: The two of them are starting to make
their way toward you.

03:16:21.086 --> 03:16:26.534
TRAVIS: Wait. Let's try and communicate!

03:16:26.534 --> 03:16:32.702
LAURA: Travis, they are going to kill us! We're
vampires! Werewolves hate vampires. You've seen

03:16:32.702 --> 03:16:33.903
enough of those movies.

03:16:33.903 --> 03:16:35.720
TALIESIN: You guys better go quick.

03:16:35.720 --> 03:16:39.166
SAM: I'm going to take the Smart Girls boy and
throw him on the floor in front of us.

03:16:39.166 --> 03:16:40.427
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:16:40.427 --> 03:16:42.580
SAM: And then run into the Twitch room.

03:16:42.580 --> 03:16:44.150
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to run into the Twitch
room.

03:16:44.150 --> 03:16:49.288
TALIESIN: You're going to run into the Twitch
room? Everybody roll, because I've been wanting to

03:16:49.288 --> 03:17:04.243
try this, where did it go? There it is! Roll wits
plus, where did it go? Roll, this is going to be

03:17:04.243 --> 03:17:13.291
weird, roll wits plus, I'm trying to find the
thing to do with this. This is going to be weird.

03:17:13.291 --> 03:17:21.917
Wits plus athletics. I'm trying something
interesting. Honestly, except for Sam. Sam doesn't

03:17:21.917 --> 03:17:23.905
have to roll anything because you are fast as
fuck.

03:17:23.905 --> 03:17:30.287
LAURA: You have the best. Three successes. Triple
sixes, creepy.

03:17:30.287 --> 03:17:32.542
LIAM: Two successes.

03:17:32.542 --> 03:17:34.959
LAURA: Oh no, what'd you do?

03:17:34.959 --> 03:17:36.952
SAM: You got no successes on yours?

03:17:36.952 --> 03:17:42.486
TRAVIS: Three successes and two fails, one of
which is red.

03:17:42.486 --> 03:17:52.531
TALIESIN: Okay. The rest of you make your way into
the room. Travis is, for some reason, still

03:17:52.531 --> 03:18:10.548
staring at that boy on the ground. The two wolves
make a jump and grab the boy. And start tearing

03:18:10.548 --> 03:18:14.342
into him. Make a wits roll to get yourself out of
there.

03:18:14.342 --> 03:18:26.127
TRAVIS: Another wits? Just wits? They're all red.
That's a success, a ten, and a one.

03:18:26.127 --> 03:18:42.428
TALIESIN: What the fuck. Okay. Yeah, the door is
jamming on you a little bit. I mean, you're there,

03:18:42.428 --> 03:18:48.489
you're on the door, it's jamming a little bit.
They're having a bit of an argument over who gets

03:18:48.489 --> 03:18:54.069
to eat the kid, and there's a bit of a back and
forth. It's like a meet-cute.

03:18:54.069 --> 03:18:57.899
TRAVIS: The wolf with the tattoos and the other
one with the shaved sides?

03:18:57.899 --> 03:19:00.086
TALIESIN: Yeah, with the shaved sides, and they're
having a bit of a run.

03:19:00.086 --> 03:19:02.163
LAURA: It's totally Ed and Rachel!

03:19:02.163 --> 03:19:10.104
TALIESIN: Yeah, your success and your failure.
Yeah, give me a, boy. You can add wits athletics

03:19:10.104 --> 03:19:14.004
or wits survival, and I would recommend burning
either some blood or some will or doing something.

03:19:14.004 --> 03:19:16.175
I keep rolling like shit.

03:19:16.175 --> 03:19:18.784
TRAVIS: I don't know how to burn will, but I'll do
whatever.

03:19:18.784 --> 03:19:24.518
TALIESIN: You knock off a will. You can add
athletics or--

03:19:24.518 --> 03:19:29.175
TRAVIS: I'll add athletics. Come on, athletics.

03:19:29.175 --> 03:19:32.498
LAURA: Muscle your way through the door. Much
better?

03:19:32.498 --> 03:19:35.664
TRAVIS: Five successes and one red failure.

03:19:35.664 --> 03:19:41.966
TALIESIN: That's good enough. I'm going to say you
get to the other side of the door but, man, you're

03:19:41.966 --> 03:19:45.092
not even going to look for a minute. You're going
to sit at the other side of that door and listen

03:19:45.092 --> 03:19:51.252
as the two of them tear this poor kid to shreds.
He is jerky.

03:19:51.252 --> 03:19:56.580
SAM: I love how he is a full adult male grown-up
employee, but he's a kid now.

03:19:56.580 --> 03:20:02.148
TALIESIN: We're all kids once we're in the jaws of
a werewolf, man. Everybody's a kid once you're a

03:20:02.148 --> 03:20:06.740
vampire. And you can hear the werewolves clawing
at the door.

03:20:06.740 --> 03:20:11.805
LIAM: I grab Laura and say: Listen, he might die.
He might die, and if he's gone, you and I are

03:20:11.805 --> 03:20:15.343
going to need each other. So you need to keep me
alive so I can protect you. And I use Presence:

03:20:15.343 --> 03:20:16.790
Awe on her.

03:20:16.790 --> 03:20:18.197
TALIESIN: All right, roll it.

03:20:18.197 --> 03:20:26.494
LAURA: Don't you have to roll every time you use
it? So you risk getting another hunger dice!

03:20:26.494 --> 03:20:29.612
TALIESIN: He gets a hunger dice if it works,
yeah.

03:20:29.612 --> 03:20:37.219
LIAM: Four successes, one of which is a red die.

03:20:37.219 --> 03:20:50.885
TALIESIN: Ah, wow. That's a good plan! It was good
enough that, let me double check.

03:20:50.885 --> 03:20:54.458
LIAM: There is no versus on the sheet.

03:20:54.458 --> 03:21:04.385
TALIESIN: Yeah. Actually, roll perception
willpower. Yeah, you're a vampire.

03:21:04.385 --> 03:21:08.505
LAURA: Where's willpower?

03:21:08.505 --> 03:21:12.943
TALIESIN: You've probably burned one of them
already. It's at the bottom left.

03:21:12.943 --> 03:21:22.431
LAURA: Oh, okay, so I have three willpowers. Okay.
Success, success. Four successes.

03:21:22.431 --> 03:21:23.948
TALIESIN: How many were you at, Liam?

03:21:23.948 --> 03:21:31.662
LIAM: Four. One of them was red. It was a crit.
Well, I need two crits.

03:21:31.662 --> 03:21:35.795
TALIESIN: I flipped a coin anyway because that's
how I enjoy the moment. I've got these great coins

03:21:35.795 --> 03:21:39.882
and I'm glad I get to use them. Yeah, he makes
sense.

03:21:39.882 --> 03:21:43.335
LAURA: Yeah, of course I'm going to make sure
you're okay!

03:21:43.335 --> 03:21:48.708
LIAM: I mean if Travis doesn't come back, or if he
does come back! It's wise to keep me alive so I

03:21:48.708 --> 03:21:50.311
can protect you.

03:21:50.311 --> 03:21:56.748
LAURA: This doesn't make any sense, but so much
sense, at the same time. I will protect you, so

03:21:56.748 --> 03:22:00.102
you can protect me. Okay? That's how it always
is.

03:22:00.102 --> 03:22:01.553
TALIESIN: Meanwhile, Travis comes back.

03:22:01.553 --> 03:22:04.893
TRAVIS: What are you talking about?

03:22:04.893 --> 03:22:09.254
LAURA: Liam said I need to protect him, so he can
protect me. But the thing is, you're back, so you

03:22:09.254 --> 03:22:10.663
can protect all of us.

03:22:10.663 --> 03:22:12.883
TRAVIS: That's so funny, he kind of said something
similar to me!

03:22:12.883 --> 03:22:15.243
LIAM: And you love Laura, so to keep her alive--

03:22:15.243 --> 03:22:19.089
TRAVIS: Can I use my Aura: Perception to
understand what Liam is doing?

03:22:19.089 --> 03:22:20.652
LIAM: Reverse math?

03:22:20.652 --> 03:22:28.150
TRAVIS: It says "interplay of colors in an aura
provides insight into the subject's emotions."

03:22:28.150 --> 03:22:32.503
TALIESIN: I'll say you can-- wait, I get to say
it! You can certainly try.

03:22:32.503 --> 03:22:38.838
TRAVIS: Okay, you have to roll manipulation plus
willpower versus my perception plus empathy.

03:22:38.838 --> 03:22:42.997
TALIESIN: It's that bottom left.

03:22:42.997 --> 03:22:46.963
LAURA: We should block the door so that Rachel and
Ed can't get in here.

03:22:46.963 --> 03:22:48.232
SAM: That was Rachel and Ed?!

03:22:48.232 --> 03:22:50.057
LAURA: Yeah dude! Did you see the tattoos?

03:22:50.057 --> 03:22:51.104
SAM: Oh my god!

03:22:51.104 --> 03:22:56.008
LAURA: While they're doing this, I'm going to push
one of the heavy things in front of the door.

03:22:56.008 --> 03:23:01.799
TALIESIN: All right, I mean, I would say make a
strength check, but you guys probably together are

03:23:01.799 --> 03:23:03.539
going to have no problem finding things to move.

03:23:03.539 --> 03:23:05.233
TRAVIS: Four successes.

03:23:05.233 --> 03:23:06.238
LIAM: Three.

03:23:06.238 --> 03:23:08.856
TALIESIN: Three successes, four? You can read his
aura.

03:23:08.856 --> 03:23:11.109
LAURA: What does that mean?

03:23:11.109 --> 03:23:15.696
TRAVIS: It means insight into his emotions,
motives, and nature.

03:23:15.696 --> 03:23:18.587
TALIESIN: Yeah, so what insight would you like?

03:23:18.587 --> 03:23:21.696
TRAVIS: I'd like to know why he's asking everyone
to protect him.

03:23:21.696 --> 03:23:23.804
LAURA: Because he wants to survive, man.

03:23:23.804 --> 03:23:25.997
TALIESIN: Why are you asking everyone to protect
you?

03:23:25.997 --> 03:23:27.204
LIAM: I need to live!

03:23:27.204 --> 03:23:32.660
TALIESIN: There you go. I had a funny feeling it
would work out that way.

03:23:32.660 --> 03:23:37.667
TRAVIS: You're asking my wife to look out for you if
it comes down to it?

03:23:37.667 --> 03:23:39.739
LIAM: So I can protect her! Uh-huh.

03:23:39.739 --> 03:23:40.959
TRAVIS: What about me?

03:23:40.959 --> 03:23:44.463
LIAM: Well, you're stronger than me. How am I
going to protect you? That's silly.

03:23:44.463 --> 03:23:48.132
TRAVIS: Right. Yeah. Makes sense. Where are we?

03:23:48.132 --> 03:23:50.119
SAM: We're inside of the Twitch.

03:23:50.119 --> 03:23:51.526
LAURA: We're inside the Twitch stages!

03:23:51.526 --> 03:23:53.426
SAM: We're here, we're in this room.

03:23:53.426 --> 03:23:54.584
LAURA: We're like, &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; here.

03:23:54.584 --> 03:23:56.008
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're about 30 feet away.

03:23:56.008 --> 03:23:57.316
TRAVIS: Can we take a look around?

03:23:57.316 --> 03:23:58.350
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:23:58.350 --> 03:24:00.925
LAURA: I am going to Obfuscate.

03:24:00.925 --> 03:24:04.776
TALIESIN: That's smart. Let's give you a little
bit of red.

03:24:04.776 --> 03:24:08.170
LIAM: Tal, I never got a penalty for what I did.

03:24:08.170 --> 03:24:10.633
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're going to get one right
there. You get one there.

03:24:10.633 --> 03:24:14.078
TRAVIS: I'll use my heightened senses to--

03:24:14.078 --> 03:24:19.200
TALIESIN: Oh wow, yeah. There are no people in
here, but all of the equipment is running and

03:24:19.200 --> 03:24:23.415
there are some lights on back at the Critical Role
stage.

03:24:23.415 --> 03:24:26.267
SAM: Are we live on Twitch?

03:24:26.267 --> 03:24:35.025
LAURA: Oh, crazy. Are we like out there? How
fucking creepy would it be if we walked out?

03:24:35.025 --> 03:24:37.424
TRAVIS: Fucking don't jump out and scare me. I
will attack whoever comes out here.

03:24:37.424 --> 03:24:38.926
TALIESIN: That's good to know.

03:24:38.926 --> 03:24:40.818
TRAVIS: If you jump out on me, it's not going to
go well for that person.

03:24:40.818 --> 03:24:43.379
TALIESIN: Are you going to look around at all
other than like, as you walk over? There's little

03:24:43.379 --> 03:24:44.608
nooks and crannies.

03:24:44.608 --> 03:24:49.190
LAURA: I'm going to stay away from them so that I
can be sneaky.

03:24:49.190 --> 03:24:51.792
TALIESIN: You're going to be sneaky. Which
direction are you going to come from?

03:24:51.792 --> 03:24:56.182
LAURA: I'm going to go, well, there's really only
one way around. I'm going to go around this back

03:24:56.182 --> 03:24:58.740
way, around that other stage so that, when they
come up this way--

03:24:58.740 --> 03:25:01.944
TALIESIN: You do see a pile of corpses back
there.

03:25:01.944 --> 03:25:04.131
LAURA: Oh shit.

03:25:04.131 --> 03:25:10.283
TALIESIN: They look like very competent corpses,
the corpses of extremely competent people who make

03:25:10.283 --> 03:25:12.075
things work.

03:25:12.075 --> 03:25:13.129
SAM: Our crew.

03:25:13.129 --> 03:25:18.401
LAURA: Oh, god. Like, around the other side of the
stage? Like they're hidden?

03:25:18.401 --> 03:25:25.583
TALIESIN: They're kind of piled in the shoebox at
the moment. Also, make a perception check really

03:25:25.583 --> 03:25:27.850
quickly, a base perception check.

03:25:27.850 --> 03:25:33.476
LAURA: That's cocked, unfortunately. One success.

03:25:33.476 --> 03:25:39.323
TALIESIN: Everything's been manhandled.
Everything's changed. Things have been moved

03:25:39.323 --> 03:25:47.887
around. Everything's a little shifted. The
Wednesday Club table is leaning against the door

03:25:47.887 --> 03:25:52.883
back here. People have been moved around. That's
my weird music.

03:25:52.883 --> 03:25:55.690
LAURA: Yeah, I couldn't tell! It sounded like the
crew was making creepy noises!

03:25:55.690 --> 03:26:10.014
TALIESIN: The Talks set has been folded away and
is in a little package. Everything's been strewn

03:26:10.014 --> 03:26:12.416
through and there's some new-- go ahead.

03:26:12.416 --> 03:26:20.725
LAURA: Can I look for my dice bag? My giant one
that's as big as a head. So I can roll, like, dice

03:26:20.725 --> 03:26:22.082
on the ground if I need to.

03:26:22.082 --> 03:26:27.344
TALIESIN: You know where to find it, so you go
look for it? As you open up the cabinet, there

03:26:27.344 --> 03:26:38.046
seems to be some sort of, I don't know, it looks
like maybe it's a pyrotechnic device. It looks

03:26:38.046 --> 03:26:42.820
like something designed to explode in the
cabinet.

03:26:42.820 --> 03:26:48.476
LAURA: Like, it's going to explode if I touch it,
or I can take it?

03:26:48.476 --> 03:26:50.573
TALIESIN: Do you touch things that look like
they're going to explode?

03:26:50.573 --> 03:26:55.465
LAURA: Not usually. Is it close by my bag that I
need?

03:26:55.465 --> 03:27:01.831
TALIESIN: It's near it, but I would not make you
roll to miss it, because it's far enough away.

03:27:01.831 --> 03:27:08.116
It's on a different shelf. But there's a little
glowing light in there, connected to things that

03:27:08.116 --> 03:27:13.679
definitely resemble some sort of dynamite or C4.
There's some sort of explosive device in here.

03:27:13.679 --> 03:27:16.474
LAURA: I'm going to take my bag.

03:27:16.474 --> 03:27:20.059
LIAM: Laura, where'd you go?

03:27:20.059 --> 03:27:25.800
TALIESIN: You're Liam'ed, man. No one can see you.
You're the shade.

03:27:25.800 --> 03:27:28.227
LAURA: I said I took it.

03:27:28.227 --> 03:27:30.710
TALIESIN: You guys, where are you heading?

03:27:30.710 --> 03:27:34.376
TRAVIS: Which way did you go? To the left? Oh, you
went to the right?

03:27:34.376 --> 03:27:37.115
LAURA: Well, I got my dice and I was going to go
around, but I can come up this way.

03:27:37.115 --> 03:27:40.810
TALIESIN: And she saw the giant pile of Chief and
Courtney.

03:27:40.810 --> 03:27:44.584
TRAVIS: Oh, we recognize a few of the corpses?

03:27:44.584 --> 03:27:50.098
TALIESIN: I mean, it depends on how-- Yeah,
probably. It's a good pile.

03:27:50.098 --> 03:27:57.529
TRAVIS: I'll make my way toward the command center
where all the computers and tricasters.

03:27:57.529 --> 03:28:05.231
TALIESIN: They're all running. There's somebody
sitting at the head of the table, but you can't

03:28:05.231 --> 03:28:11.303
quite see. It's no one you recognize, and you
can't quite figure out who it is. There's a little

03:28:11.303 --> 03:28:13.681
off-kilter.

03:28:13.681 --> 03:28:18.118
LAURA: You're making sure nobody's going to jump
out at you?

03:28:18.118 --> 03:28:20.172
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was entranced.

03:28:20.172 --> 03:28:23.697
TALIESIN: Everything's a little off.

03:28:23.697 --> 03:28:29.463
TRAVIS: I keep going up more.

03:28:29.463 --> 03:28:33.326
TALIESIN: You see, painted in blood across the
outside of the set--

03:28:33.326 --> 03:28:34.724
LAURA: This set?

03:28:34.724 --> 03:28:38.119
TALIESIN: This set. "Life needs things to live."

03:28:38.119 --> 03:28:45.745
LAURA: Oh my god, Taliesin's inside! Are you
inside this set?

03:28:45.745 --> 03:28:52.176
TRAVIS: The person that I can't see. Hello?

03:28:52.176 --> 03:28:59.425
TALIESIN: You see hair. There's a little tuft of
white hair and someone furiously writing notes.

03:28:59.425 --> 03:29:05.521
TRAVIS: Excuse me, we just made our--

03:29:05.521 --> 03:29:16.780
TALIESIN: "You made it! Oh, that's super." There
in front of you is a pale, older gentleman with a

03:29:16.780 --> 03:29:24.303
bit of a beard and thin at the hair, but he's an
older gentleman. Quite pale and porcelain skin,

03:29:24.303 --> 03:29:34.330
like he's definitely, I don't want to say "jolly"
vampire, but there's something so charming about him.

03:29:34.330 --> 03:29:38.837
TRAVIS: Do we recognize his face?

03:29:38.837 --> 03:29:50.419
TALIESIN: Make an intelligence, oh, what would I
call this? Either academics or occult.

03:29:50.419 --> 03:29:56.462
LAURA: Are you all walking in the set?

03:29:56.462 --> 03:29:59.131
SAM: Liam and I never said which way we had gone.

03:29:59.131 --> 03:30:00.468
LIAM: No.

03:30:00.468 --> 03:30:05.498
TRAVIS: That is two successes. Of three dice.

03:30:05.498 --> 03:30:07.110
TALIESIN: Yeah, no.

03:30:07.110 --> 03:30:13.629
LIAM: I think I would be a good ways behind big
man, watching him work his magic.

03:30:13.629 --> 03:30:15.733
TRAVIS: I just rolled academics, nothing else.

03:30:15.733 --> 03:30:25.807
TALIESIN: "I'm so glad to meet you. This is great.
I mean, there have been some problems, I admit it.

03:30:25.807 --> 03:30:29.688
"There were some things that didn't really go the
way I wanted them to, but hey! Hey, you're here.

03:30:29.688 --> 03:30:31.232
"Where's everybody else?"

03:30:31.232 --> 03:30:35.527
TRAVIS: I'm sorry to interrupt you. Are you
responsible for the puzzle lock on the door?

03:30:35.527 --> 03:30:40.378
TALIESIN: "Yeah, I mean, we're supposed to do a
thing, and I really enjoy these kind of things.

03:30:40.378 --> 03:30:45.020
"Ivan was really happy to help, so we sort of--
Actually, Ivan really helped put it together. He's

03:30:45.020 --> 03:30:46.116
"a smart kid."

03:30:46.116 --> 03:30:49.078
TRAVIS: My name is Travis--

03:30:49.078 --> 03:30:51.166
TALIESIN: "Oh yeah, I know. Hi. It's a pleasure."

03:30:51.166 --> 03:30:52.418
TRAVIS: Pleasure. And you are?

03:30:52.418 --> 03:31:04.231
TALIESIN: "My name's Gary. It's a pleasure. Gary
Gygax. I'm a big fan. It's really nice to meet you

03:31:04.231 --> 03:31:06.861
"in person. This is great."

03:31:06.861 --> 03:31:08.170
TRAVIS: &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; Gary Gygax?

03:31:08.170 --> 03:31:10.046
TALIESIN: "I mean, that's fair to say."

03:31:10.046 --> 03:31:14.047
LIAM: Gary Gygax is no longer living!

03:31:14.047 --> 03:31:24.850
TRAVIS: Thanks, Liam! We found ourselves in a bit
of a situation. Do you happen to know what's going

03:31:24.850 --> 03:31:26.189
on around here?

03:31:26.189 --> 03:31:31.447
TALIESIN: "Yeah! And I've been looking forward to
you guys figuring out my puzzle and coming on in.

03:31:31.447 --> 03:31:39.248
"This is great. I'm so excited about the next stage
of everything. This is really, super exciting."

03:31:39.248 --> 03:31:41.726
TRAVIS: Is there anyone else in this studio at the
moment?

03:31:41.726 --> 03:31:47.512
TALIESIN: "Probably not at the moment. I've got
some people outside, we're ready to load the

03:31:47.512 --> 03:31:53.151
"trucks. Everything's up to go. Everything is more
or less set up. I've got some people, we've got

03:31:53.151 --> 03:31:57.522
"some things coming in and out. There's a lot of
commotion. This is a big process."

03:31:57.522 --> 03:32:01.009
TRAVIS: Outside? Forgive me, this is all very new
to me, but isn't the sun up outside?

03:32:01.009 --> 03:32:05.789
TALIESIN: "For a minute longer, and then of course
Ivan can take care of that. He's very clever that

03:32:05.789 --> 03:32:11.853
"way. But we have people. I mean, you'll know this
someday, you get to a certain point and you have

03:32:11.853 --> 03:32:14.036
"people who can do these things for you. It's
really nice."

03:32:14.036 --> 03:32:16.387
TRAVIS: Right. Sam? Liam? Laura?

03:32:16.387 --> 03:32:19.858
SAM: I'm coming up and I'm going to say: Big
fan--

03:32:19.858 --> 03:32:25.311
TALIESIN: "Thank you! See, the riddle was a double
thing, because, you know, vampires come from a

03:32:25.311 --> 03:32:30.284
"box, and Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons comes from a box! It's
a double pun. I was really, it was actually Ivan

03:32:30.284 --> 03:32:32.395
"who came up with it, but I signed off."

03:32:32.395 --> 03:32:38.706
LIAM: Still not in, and I'm unscrewing two pipes
for a microphone setup so I can have a bar in my hand.

03:32:38.706 --> 03:32:40.046
TALIESIN: It's smart to have.

03:32:40.046 --> 03:32:43.998
LAURA: I'm creeping around the side and stealthily
peeking.

03:32:43.998 --> 03:32:45.243
TALIESIN: Make an investigation check.

03:32:45.243 --> 03:32:49.748
SAM: Is he on this set, or is he at the control
board?

03:32:49.748 --> 03:33:02.238
TALIESIN: He's sitting right here. Make a
perception investigation. I'm excited to see if

03:33:02.238 --> 03:33:03.642
you find this.

03:33:03.642 --> 03:33:11.342
SAM: I'm going to pull out my Wyrmwood gaming tray
from under the table over there and hand it to him

03:33:11.342 --> 03:33:12.598
and ask him to sign it.

03:33:12.598 --> 03:33:14.493
TALIESIN: Oh, happily. He is into it.

03:33:14.493 --> 03:33:17.010
LAURA: Six successes.

03:33:17.010 --> 03:33:27.414
TALIESIN: There is a breeze coming from under the
Wednesday Club table.

03:33:27.414 --> 03:33:29.776
LAURA: Like, here?

03:33:29.776 --> 03:33:35.730
TALIESIN: Yeah. If you look behind the Wednesday
Club table, there is a tunnel going down

03:33:35.730 --> 03:33:48.716
somewhere. So it's maybe a minute before the sun
goes down, but I'm saying someone's been getting

03:33:48.716 --> 03:33:53.615
in or out of here no matter what the sun says.
Good find!

03:33:53.615 --> 03:34:00.083
TRAVIS: Mr. Gygax, I'm not really sure what comes
next. Can you tell us a little bit about what we

03:34:00.083 --> 03:34:01.438
have to look forward to?

03:34:01.438 --> 03:34:06.458
TALIESIN: "Well, I was waiting till everybody was
going to be here, but everybody I'm sure is still

03:34:06.458 --> 03:34:08.942
"having a time. It's a mess out there, I really
apologize."

03:34:08.942 --> 03:34:10.750
SAM: You killed our dungeon master, so.

03:34:10.750 --> 03:34:13.647
TALIESIN: "I mean, he's going to be fine, though.
He's going to be fine. "

03:34:13.647 --> 03:34:16.949
TRAVIS: He turned to ash in the sun.

03:34:16.949 --> 03:34:18.345
TALIESIN: "What?"

03:34:18.345 --> 03:34:19.709
TRAVIS: Yeah, unfortunately--

03:34:19.709 --> 03:34:23.358
SAM: Are you saying that once the magic is broken,
everybody comes back to life again?

03:34:23.358 --> 03:34:25.122
TALIESIN: "No. What? Wait, where's Matt?"

03:34:25.122 --> 03:34:30.760
TRAVIS: Matthew Mercer opened a curtain near the
front of the building and was struck by a ray of

03:34:30.760 --> 03:34:36.658
sunlight. Is that not reversible?

03:34:36.658 --> 03:34:50.700
TALIESIN: "I mean, I was aware that one of you
might-- something bad might happen, but we need him!"

03:34:50.700 --> 03:34:52.493
TRAVIS: It's not just Matt.

03:34:52.493 --> 03:34:55.407
SAM: We do need him for the show.

03:34:55.407 --> 03:35:02.160
TALIESIN: "I mean, you guys ended everything! We
worked really hard to make sure you can keep doing

03:35:02.160 --> 03:35:09.162
"this for as long as we need, and you let your
dungeon master walk into the sun! You guys are

03:35:09.162 --> 03:35:16.038
"great. You're the best. God, ugh."

03:35:16.038 --> 03:35:17.624
SAM: Before you freak out--

03:35:17.624 --> 03:35:19.355
TRAVIS: I think it's past that a little.

03:35:19.355 --> 03:35:22.149
TALIESIN: "What are you doing now that Matt's
gone?"

03:35:22.149 --> 03:35:26.097
SAM: I've run a one-shot! I know how to DM!

03:35:26.097 --> 03:35:31.360
TALIESIN: "That one-shot was, let's be fair, that
was mostly math and you were riding on the talent

03:35:31.360 --> 03:35:33.016
"of your players. Let's be fair."

03:35:33.016 --> 03:35:34.705
SAM: Liam's done a couple! Liam's pretty good!

03:35:34.705 --> 03:35:38.101
LIAM: I'm not here. I'm quietly looking for Laura
outside of the Critical Role table.

03:35:38.101 --> 03:35:40.106
TALIESIN: Is Liam dead too?

03:35:40.106 --> 03:35:41.351
SAM: No, Liam's alive!

03:35:41.351 --> 03:35:47.310
TALIESIN: "Or not, he's undead, apparently. We
went to all this trouble."

03:35:47.310 --> 03:35:50.056
TRAVIS: Marisha turned to mushroom.

03:35:50.056 --> 03:35:51.823
TALIESIN: "Oh, for God's sakes."

03:35:51.823 --> 03:35:54.746
TRAVIS: There was tea, apparently, and she had
some.

03:35:54.746 --> 03:35:59.531
TALIESIN: "Well, apparently you had some people
working here who weren't entirely human, and

03:35:59.531 --> 03:36:05.065
"apparently we did our thing and things got weird.
You have some weird people here, you know that? God!"

03:36:05.065 --> 03:36:06.679
SAM: We ate some of them, yeah.

03:36:06.679 --> 03:36:08.515
LIAM: (whispering) Twinnie!

03:36:08.515 --> 03:36:15.711
TALIESIN: "You know, you should never meet your
heroes. This is very disappointing."

03:36:15.711 --> 03:36:17.541
TRAVIS: Was he calling us--?

03:36:17.541 --> 03:36:21.098
SAM: I think that's a compliment. Weird,
backhanded compliment.

03:36:21.098 --> 03:36:22.982
TALIESIN: "I was happy for a while. I don't even,
like--"

03:36:22.982 --> 03:36:27.461
LIAM: Twinnie! Laura!

03:36:27.461 --> 03:36:31.531
TALIESIN: I'm enjoying the fact that this is
everything I ever wanted, right there. This is

03:36:31.531 --> 03:36:38.721
what it's like to be next to you, by the way.
Stealthy. "We had a plan. We had an underground

03:36:38.721 --> 03:36:44.863
"bunker for you guys to shoot from. We were putting
together a new crew. We had every-- Oh my god, the

03:36:44.863 --> 03:36:45.777
"money, and--"

03:36:45.777 --> 03:36:47.818
SAM: You had to pay for this?

03:36:47.818 --> 03:36:52.737
TALIESIN: "This was expensive, and I mean, there
are rules about what you can do, and I have done

03:36:52.737 --> 03:36:57.583
"some things to make this happen that are a little
questionable."

03:36:57.583 --> 03:37:10.252
SAM: A little? Well, you know, you could have
asked us to come play! Hey, wait! Wait! You're a

03:37:10.252 --> 03:37:16.315
dungeon master! You could lead the game, right?

03:37:16.315 --> 03:37:23.081
TALIESIN: "This is nothing personal, Sam. I just
really wanted to play with Matt."

03:37:23.081 --> 03:37:33.389
(laughter)

03:37:33.389 --> 03:37:42.930
TRAVIS: Dunked on by Gary Gygax! Posterized! The
burn is real! Sunbeam!

03:37:42.930 --> 03:37:58.364
TALIESIN: He clicks a button on a remote. "Well,
regardless, it was really nice to meet you. I have

03:37:58.364 --> 03:38:01.970
"something I'd love for you to sign. Well, you've
got about 60 seconds, so I figure we might as well

03:38:01.970 --> 03:38:03.853
"get this done before everything goes."

03:38:03.853 --> 03:38:05.417
TRAVIS: What happens in 60 seconds?

03:38:05.417 --> 03:38:09.692
TALIESIN: "Well, I mean, we've got to clean up
everything, so. You're welcome to go outside if

03:38:09.692 --> 03:38:12.671
"you like, but otherwise we're taking care of this
right now."

03:38:12.671 --> 03:38:16.839
LAURA: I peek my head in right there where he
can't see.

03:38:16.839 --> 03:38:21.038
LIAM: And I dive over to where she is. What do we
do?

03:38:21.038 --> 03:38:25.074
TRAVIS: We would love to sign whatever it is.

03:38:25.074 --> 03:38:26.413
SAM: We need a silver Sharpie.

03:38:26.413 --> 03:38:32.210
TRAVIS: We're very particular about the metallic
colors. It's right over by the computers.

03:38:32.210 --> 03:38:37.730
TALIESIN: "You're not trying to-- I mean, there's
nowhere to go, is there?" He starts to get up, and

03:38:37.730 --> 03:38:39.621
he starts to grow claws.

03:38:39.621 --> 03:38:42.043
SAM: I'm going to speed-dash toward Laura and
Liam.

03:38:42.043 --> 03:38:47.060
TALIESIN: He's starting to get a little Baba
Yaga-y. There's claws coming out.

03:38:47.060 --> 03:38:55.130
TRAVIS: Now, Mr. Gygax, there's really no need to
grow shit out of your hands. I merely want to sign

03:38:55.130 --> 03:38:58.160
whatever-- What do you have for me to sign?

03:38:58.160 --> 03:39:14.689
TALIESIN: He slowly reaches in and pulls out Matt
Mercer's Vecna statue. "You'll sign that, and I'll

03:39:14.689 --> 03:39:16.087
"be taking it."

03:39:16.087 --> 03:39:31.878
TRAVIS: I think that will be fine. I grab the
Vecna statue. You don't happen to have a pen on

03:39:31.878 --> 03:39:33.420
you, do you?

03:39:33.420 --> 03:39:46.180
TALIESIN: Let's flip. Oh! As he reaches for a pen,
suddenly, at great speed, there's a blur that

03:39:46.180 --> 03:39:57.022
comes and smashes him against the side of the
wall. He is briefly dazed as you see there's

03:39:57.022 --> 03:40:04.254
another vampire, teeth out, eyes blazing, holding
him against the wall, and he turns and looks at

03:40:04.254 --> 03:40:12.083
you all, and Matt Colville says, "This is your
moment! Run! Run!" and goes in and holds Gary

03:40:12.083 --> 03:40:13.837
Gygax against the wall.

03:40:13.837 --> 03:40:14.885
TRAVIS: Where?!

03:40:14.885 --> 03:40:15.848
SAM: Let's get out of here!

03:40:15.848 --> 03:40:17.697
LAURA: Outside! Tunnel, I've got a tunnel! There's
a tunnel!

03:40:17.697 --> 03:40:19.071
SAM: Let's go out the tunnel!

03:40:19.071 --> 03:40:20.597
TRAVIS: No, he said there was a studio
downstairs!

03:40:20.597 --> 03:40:23.319
LIAM: Blam, Blam, Blam!

03:40:23.319 --> 03:40:25.324
TALIESIN: They're starting to wrestle with each
other.

03:40:25.324 --> 03:40:27.031
TRAVIS: We run down the tunnel!

03:40:27.031 --> 03:40:36.378
TALIESIN: You run? Man, just as you run down the
tunnel, Gary Gygax breaks his hold on Matt

03:40:36.378 --> 03:40:39.944
Colville. They break apart and Gary makes a run
for the tunnel.

03:40:39.944 --> 03:40:41.903
TRAVIS: Gary does, or Matt does?

03:40:41.903 --> 03:40:43.633
TALIESIN: Gary. Matt's against the wall.

03:40:43.633 --> 03:40:47.467
TRAVIS: I take the Vecna statue and I go, ah!

03:40:47.467 --> 03:40:55.788
TALIESIN: It's enough to distract. Just in a
second if you all get underneath the Wednesday Club table--

03:40:55.788 --> 03:40:58.743
SAM: We're going in.

03:40:58.743 --> 03:41:03.878
TALIESIN: And you hear the flames as the air above
you lights, as Geek &amp;amp; Sundry goes up in flames.

03:41:03.878 --> 03:41:15.202
And we'll be back next week with your subterranean
adventures, now that you've killed two of the

03:41:15.202 --> 03:41:17.373
greatest DMs-- Three of the greatest DMs that have
ever lived.

03:41:17.373 --> 03:41:18.583
SAM: Two Matts dead.

03:41:18.583 --> 03:41:21.131
TALIESIN: Two Matts dead, and a Gygax. Well done.

03:41:21.131 --> 03:41:27.961
SAM: Yes, but the three new best DMs in the world
have survived, so.

03:41:27.961 --> 03:41:31.580
TALIESIN: I feel like Gary was quite clear on
that.

03:41:31.580 --> 03:41:34.733
TRAVIS: I have not killed any humans yet.

03:41:34.733 --> 03:41:36.639
LAURA: Good for you, babe.

03:41:36.639 --> 03:41:38.520
TALIESIN: You know what you get for that?

03:41:38.520 --> 03:41:39.401
TRAVIS: What?

03:41:39.401 --> 03:41:44.342
TALIESIN: Hungry, fucker. What are you at?

03:41:44.342 --> 03:41:45.483
TRAVIS: That's five.

03:41:45.483 --> 03:41:52.129
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, next time you see one, it's
going. Hey guys! I hope you enjoyed my-- I'm going

03:41:52.129 --> 03:41:56.071
to be a little bit more together next time. This
was a little bit ramshackle.

03:41:56.071 --> 03:41:57.191
TRAVIS: You were great!

03:41:57.191 --> 03:42:01.993
TALIESIN: Thank you, I had fun. It's going to be a
little different. I'm going to play a little bit

03:42:01.993 --> 03:42:04.526
more, we're going to have more fun with the social
and maybe get into a little bit of the World of

03:42:04.526 --> 03:42:09.179
Darkness now that I feel like they've got a hang
on things. I'm going to give everyone a little

03:42:09.179 --> 03:42:15.139
more power and a little more idea of what they can
do. Shift things around. We may have a special

03:42:15.139 --> 03:42:21.728
guest. Maybe, maybe not, since it's only four of
you. I may get one more for fun. We'll see. I

03:42:21.728 --> 03:42:27.079
haven't reached out yet because we have so much
shit to do over the next 48 hours, all of us.

03:42:27.079 --> 03:42:29.030
LIAM: Yeah, everything else on pause.

03:42:29.030 --> 03:42:34.196
TALIESIN: It's nuts. Thank you all for tuning in
to this. We are doing one more week of this insane

03:42:34.196 --> 03:42:43.174
run, and it's going to get weirder. Probably less
evil? Maybe, I don't know. I'm so pleased. Thank you

03:42:43.174 --> 03:42:51.000
guys so much. This system is a lot of fun to play,
and if you do get a chance, there's either the

03:42:51.000 --> 03:42:55.642
classic or the new edition or both. Wonderful
treats. There's an alpha available to play with.

03:42:55.642 --> 03:43:02.128
There's all of the old books, and they used to do
every city, every clan. I'd be very curious to see

03:43:02.128 --> 03:43:08.239
if anybody could start guessing what clans I've
pushed everybody gently towards. Not that they

03:43:08.239 --> 03:43:13.017
know anything yet. And if anybody figured out what
Ivan was, and if anybody figured out what was

03:43:13.017 --> 03:43:18.378
happening at the front of the Geek &amp;amp; Sundry
offices, and anybody figured out what-- I think

03:43:18.378 --> 03:43:25.325
everybody figured out what happened with Ed and
Rachel. They might have survived, I don't know.

03:43:25.325 --> 03:43:28.876
Werewolves are tough, man. Anyway, thank you guys
so much.

03:43:28.876 --> 03:43:37.231
SAM: Thanks to our sponsor, Backblaze! Cloud-based
subscription. They back up software. Get it,

03:43:37.231 --> 03:43:43.373
download it, and use backblaze.com/criticalrole to
get special other things.

03:43:43.373 --> 03:43:46.001
TRAVIS: That's right. If you haven't tried it,
give it a try.

03:43:46.001 --> 03:43:50.940
TALIESIN: And thank you to everybody at Geek &amp;amp;
Sundry, Nerdist, Legendary, and Smart Girls for

03:43:50.940 --> 03:43:56.209
giving me permission. I've been running through
the building all week going, Is it cool if I kill

03:43:56.209 --> 03:44:04.724
you? All right. Because there's a moment where a
little bit of playful consensual violence can be a

03:44:04.724 --> 03:44:12.647
good time. Can feel good. Lets you relax. Not me,
but maybe the rest of you. Good night, everybody.

03:44:12.647 --> 03:44:17.171
Stay safe, have fun, and is it Thursday yet?

03:44:17.171 --> 03:44:20.372
(evil laughter)

03:44:20.372 --> 03:52:48.248
