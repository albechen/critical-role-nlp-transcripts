00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.804
MATT: Hey, everyone. Sorry about that little issue
there. But thank you for your patience. I

00:00:03.883 --> 00:00:11.648
appreciate that. Going back over what had
transpired previously. So the party was hired to

00:00:11.648 --> 00:00:17.791
go into Kraghammer seeking Lady Kima of Vord, who
is a renowned folk hero, a halfling paladin of

00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:24.044
much renown, following Bahamut, the Platinum
Dragon of justice and good, who went on a vision

00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:29.016
quest, apparently seeing some sort of evil brewing
beneath Kraghammer, and went on her own to seek it

00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:34.488
and destroy it. Hasn't been seen for many
weeks-- months, even -- since. And so the party has

00:00:34.488 --> 00:00:39.559
then gone into Kraghammer to attempt to locate
her. After some conversing, some brawling, some

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.209
interesting circumstances, they found information
that she disappeared into the Mithril mines just

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:49.399
underneath the lower circle of Kraghammer. They've
since battled a few creatures, apparently these

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.034
strange monstrosities are coming out of the mines
recently. And they've had dwarven miners being

00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:59.659
taken and disappearing. They charged into the
mines, found one of the series of tunnels that had

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:06.029
broken into the mines from some other source,
encountered a few umber hulks, were ambushed by

00:01:06.243 --> 00:01:10.356
some duergar, which are subterranean, dark, ashen
grey--

00:01:10.356 --> 00:01:11.308
TRAVIS: Dickholes.

00:01:11.308 --> 00:01:16.144
MATT: -- messed-up dwarves and an intellect
devourer, which proceeded to blast Grog, reduce

00:01:16.195 --> 00:01:19.040
his intelligence to zero, and leave him catatonic
and brain-dead.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.003
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:23.340
MATT: And that's where we left off. But we'll pick
up that in a second. Let's go ahead and continue

00:01:23.393 --> 00:01:26.500
our introductions. We had Taliesin, now we have
Marisha--

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.514
MARISHA: Yes! Hello, I am Marisha Ray, and I am
Keyleth of the Air Ashari tribe.

00:01:32.514 --> 00:01:35.856
And I am the Circle of the Moon druid. Level nine.

00:01:36.014 --> 00:01:36.914
MATT: Mm-hm.

00:01:36.914 --> 00:01:37.926
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:01:37.926 --> 00:01:40.015
MATT: Orion?

00:01:40.015 --> 00:01:48.894
ORION: Hi! I am Orion Acaba. And I play Tiberius
Stormwind, the dragonborn sorcerer.

00:01:48.894 --> 00:01:51.304
Level nine. Super badass.

00:01:51.304 --> 00:01:53.166
TRAVIS: Scaly.

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:58.110
SAM: Oh hi, I am Sam Riegel. I play Scanlan
Shorthalt, the level nine bard gnome,

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.797
who is the handsomest and most charming of 
the group.

00:02:01.797 --> 00:02:04.786
(all laugh)

00:02:04.786 --> 00:02:06.020
TRAVIS: Scanlan Shorthalt.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.072
SAM: Scanlan Shorthalt.

00:02:07.072 --> 00:02:08.401
MATT: Yeah. Esquire.

00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:10.286
LAURA: The third.

00:02:10.286 --> 00:02:11.692
MATT: Yes, the third.

00:02:11.692 --> 00:02:14.410
LAURA: Hi! Oh, my brother is extra, extra stealth
right now.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.307
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:02:15.307 --> 00:02:20.842
LAURA: But I play Vex'ahlia, who is a half-elf
ranger, and I have an amazing--

00:02:20.842 --> 00:02:21.676
SAM: Ranger!

00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:28.188
LAURA: -- companion bear named Trinket, who is
basically the coolest ever. And he's good at

00:02:28.188 --> 00:02:32.638
everything he does. I'm okay. But he's excellent.

00:02:32.638 --> 00:02:34.837
MATT: He's really, really good. Yeah.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.167
TRAVIS: I'm Grog Strongjaw. I'm a goliath
barbarian, level nine.

00:02:41.167 --> 00:02:42.755
LAURA: Oh, I didn't say that. Level nine.

00:02:42.755 --> 00:02:45.913
TRAVIS: I have an intelligence of six normally,
but now it's negative two.

00:02:45.993 --> 00:02:46.812
LAURA: Oh!

00:02:46.812 --> 00:02:48.356
TRAVIS: And my brain is made of applesauce.

00:02:48.356 --> 00:02:51.251
LAURA: Poor Grog!

00:02:51.251 --> 00:02:53.816
MATT: Liam, who is not here yet, but will be here
shortly but--

00:02:53.816 --> 00:02:54.724
TRAVIS: He's peeing.

00:02:54.724 --> 00:02:55.603
MATT: He is peeing, and what's--

00:02:55.603 --> 00:02:56.352
ORION: Oh my god.

00:02:56.352 --> 00:02:57.199
TRAVIS: On a tree.

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:58.551
MATT: And when he returns we'll get to his
introduction as well.

00:02:58.551 --> 00:02:59.325
TRAVIS: Stealthily.

00:02:59.325 --> 00:03:01.245
MATT: And Ashley Johnson, who has missed the last
couple of games because she's been filming,

00:03:01.245 --> 00:03:03.064
when she returns will be playing Pike.

00:03:03.064 --> 00:03:04.261
LAURA: Hey!

00:03:04.261 --> 00:03:06.027
TALIESIN: Hey!

00:03:06.027 --> 00:03:07.065
MATT: Who is a cleric. Our gnome cleric.

00:03:07.065 --> 00:03:08.946
Liam's arrived! Huzzah!

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.506
LAURA: We're just introducing ourselves, that's
all.

00:03:10.506 --> 00:03:12.410
MATT: Exactly! It's okay, we've had technical
difficulties, so.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.812
ORION: Oh, hey, he made the introductions, folks.

00:03:13.812 --> 00:03:15.064
LAURA: Oh, hi, Mark, welcome to the game.

00:03:15.064 --> 00:03:16.212
LIAM: Oh, hi.

00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:18.310
MATT: Before we start too, just a couple quick
announcements. A couple cool games that have come

00:03:18.376 --> 00:03:21.531
out recently that some of us have been involved
with. Today was the launch of Pillars of Eternity,

00:03:21.531 --> 00:03:25.567
a completely awesome kind of successor to Baldur's
Gate. Both me and Liam are part of that as well.

00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:27.940
Those who are playing through, I voice Aloth and
Adair.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.873
Liam, if you remember any characters you voiced 
in it.

00:03:29.936 --> 00:03:31.580
LIAM: The guy.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.477
MATT: The guy.

00:03:32.477 --> 00:03:33.114
LAURA: (laughs)

00:03:33.114 --> 00:03:34.331
MATT: He voices the guy.

00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:36.946
We're scattered throughout the game so
just-- If you can't get enough of us here, you'll

00:03:37.002 --> 00:03:40.302
be really hating our voices by playing through
that. And then also, Orion--

00:03:40.302 --> 00:03:44.638
ORION: Oh, yeah. On a more radder note, Final
Fantasy Type-0--

00:03:44.638 --> 00:03:48.639
you should play-- is out also. I play Nine. 
In that.

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:49.392
MATT: Yeah.

00:03:49.392 --> 00:03:51.242
ORION: And Matthew Mercer plays Trey in it as
well.

00:03:51.242 --> 00:03:52.168
MATT: Yeah.

00:03:52.168 --> 00:03:53.763
LIAM: I thought seven ate nine.

00:03:53.763 --> 00:03:54.693
LAURA: We're all pimping our shizz.

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:56.815
ORION: Seven does maybe eat nine. Who knows?

00:03:56.815 --> 00:03:57.646
MATT: Oh.

00:03:57.646 --> 00:03:58.766
LIAM: I'm a dad.

00:03:58.766 --> 00:04:00.452
MARISHA: (laughs) I'm a dad.

00:04:00.452 --> 00:04:02.755
ORION: Who knows, but it's definitely a different
take on any Final Fantasy you've ever played.

00:04:02.755 --> 00:04:05.929
And as a fan, I'm excited, so check it out, too.

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:08.497
MATT: Yeah, it's legit awesome. So a lot of cool,
exciting things.

00:04:08.497 --> 00:04:12.305
LIAM: Also, this one's in Tales from the
Borderlands being awesome.

00:04:12.305 --> 00:04:12.929
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:13.658
MATT: Yeah.

00:04:13.658 --> 00:04:14.677
LAURA: Episode two just came out.

00:04:14.677 --> 00:04:15.561
MATT: That's right! Congrats!

00:04:15.561 --> 00:04:16.276
LAURA: Yes.

00:04:16.276 --> 00:04:18.003
SAM: And I'll be playing at the Laugh Barn in St.
Louis.

00:04:18.003 --> 00:04:20.085
(all laugh)

00:04:20.085 --> 00:04:21.476
ORION: Every Tuesday.

00:04:21.476 --> 00:04:23.583
SAM: Three. Three nights. Three nights sold out.

00:04:23.583 --> 00:04:24.558
ORION: Three nights.

00:04:24.558 --> 00:04:25.781
SAM: Opening for Carrot Top.

00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:27.968
ORION: Check it out.

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:31.309
MATT: All right. Well, guys, let's go get down to
brass tacks.

00:04:31.464 --> 00:04:41.419
So, last we left off, in a subterranean
cavern with a deep underground river flowing

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:47.634
through it. Pitch darkness. You managed to survive
a conflict with two umber hulks, thanks to

00:04:47.834 --> 00:04:52.321
Polymorph and some good tactics. However, Grog
then charged headlong towards a light source--

00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:57.212
turned out to be a campfire across the way-- where
he walked into an ambush by a few duergar which

00:04:57.212 --> 00:05:00.115
began shooting him with crossbow bolts. And an
intellect devourer

00:05:00.115 --> 00:05:02.133
made him brain-dead. You guys--

00:05:02.133 --> 00:05:03.711
LAURA: He's got nobody to blame but himself.

00:05:03.711 --> 00:05:07.006
MATT: Kind of, that's okay. Grog owns it-- as you
can see by his glasses. So.

00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:09.609
(all laugh)

00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:10.609
MARISHA: I love those.

00:05:10.609 --> 00:05:13.885
MATT: So. We're beginning now as Grog has
collapsed, face down on the ground, drooling.

00:05:13.885 --> 00:05:15.149
LIAM: The future's so bright.

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:18.754
MATT: The last of the duergar have been blown off
the cliff or destroyed. You all rush in, and find

00:05:18.754 --> 00:05:23.392
Grog not moving, not responding, not anything.

00:05:23.392 --> 00:05:25.038
TRAVIS: Somebody pretty give me CPR.

00:05:25.038 --> 00:05:26.034
LAURA: Don't talk.

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:27.058
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:05:27.058 --> 00:05:28.862
SAM: Grog! Grog, can you hear us?

00:05:28.862 --> 00:05:29.610
LAURA: I rush down--

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.434
SAM: Can you feel us near you?

00:05:30.434 --> 00:05:31.937
LAURA: -- and slap him on the face a few times.

00:05:31.937 --> 00:05:32.585
MATT: You slap him.

00:05:32.585 --> 00:05:33.224
SAM: Nothing.

00:05:33.224 --> 00:05:34.134
MATT: You slap him.

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:34.950
SAM: Nothing.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.832
MATT: You slap him. No response.

00:05:35.832 --> 00:05:37.633
SAM: Someone, quick! Draw a dick on his face!

00:05:37.633 --> 00:05:40.466
MARISHA: I also bend down and slap him a few
times.

00:05:40.466 --> 00:05:41.897
(all laugh)

00:05:41.897 --> 00:05:48.021
MARISHA: And then I say, I knew it wouldn't work.
I just-- Dammit, Grog!

00:05:48.021 --> 00:05:51.721
TALIESIN: I'm going to actually try a crude
medical examination to see if I can--

00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:53.108
SAM: Ooh, investigation check?

00:05:53.108 --> 00:05:54.474
TRAVIS: So here's your numbers.

00:05:54.474 --> 00:05:55.302
MATT: Okay.

00:05:55.302 --> 00:05:59.413
TALIESIN: And yes! This is nice. 19.

00:05:59.413 --> 00:06:00.502
MATT: A 19 on the medicine?

00:06:00.502 --> 00:06:01.774
TALIESIN: On the medicine, yeah.

00:06:01.774 --> 00:06:02.493
MATT: Okay.

00:06:02.493 --> 00:06:03.459
TRAVIS: You leave my prostate alone.

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:04.800
(all laugh)

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.304
TALIESIN: After I palpate the region.

00:06:06.304 --> 00:06:09.104
MATT: A thorough goliath cavity search later--

00:06:09.104 --> 00:06:11.882
MARISHA: Ohh.

00:06:11.882 --> 00:06:13.442
MATT: You find some stray gold pieces.

00:06:13.493 --> 00:06:15.487
LIAM: There's where that pony went!

00:06:15.487 --> 00:06:18.752
TALIESIN: That's a very deep belly button you have
there, my god!

00:06:18.752 --> 00:06:21.183
MATT: The goliath physicality's a little
difficult.

00:06:21.183 --> 00:06:22.549
LIAM: Found the troll dick!

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:25.803
LAURA: Ohh.

00:06:25.856 --> 00:06:30.164
MATT: Looking over him, and there's very little
physical damage to him. He shrugs it off pretty

00:06:30.164 --> 00:06:34.759
easily. There's no notable sign or anything other
than the fact that his eyes aren't reacting to

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:36.795
anything. It looks like he is catatonic.

00:06:36.795 --> 00:06:38.207
TALIESIN: No bleeding from the ear? No bleeding
from the nose?

00:06:38.207 --> 00:06:39.306
MATT: Nope.

00:06:39.306 --> 00:06:42.706
TALIESIN: I'm going to go take a look at the
remnants of the brain creature.

00:06:42.706 --> 00:06:47.158
MATT: All right. What bits of the currently
thawing chunks of it-- blasted apart by Tiberius'

00:06:47.158 --> 00:06:52.938
Glacial Blast-- It appears to be tougher than
normal, but very similar to gray matter in appearance

00:06:52.987 --> 00:06:59.820
and texture. Other than these strange, kind of
reddish-brown bestial legs that were once attached

00:06:59.934 --> 00:07:03.226
to its mid-section are now blown apart and cast to
the ground.

00:07:03.226 --> 00:07:06.563
The whole texture seems very slimy and rubbery.

00:07:06.563 --> 00:07:07.528
LAURA: Ew.

00:07:07.528 --> 00:07:11.597
MATT: And it's much larger than any natural brain
should be. It's probably-- When it was all in one

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:15.250
piece, it would have been roughly about the size
of a small dog.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.926
LAURA: Do any of us know anything about magic that
could heal him? Like any spells.

00:07:20.926 --> 00:07:22.913
MATT: Do you?

00:07:22.913 --> 00:07:23.587
LAURA: I mean--

00:07:23.587 --> 00:07:24.549
MARISHA: I think I might--

00:07:24.549 --> 00:07:30.927
ORION: It's clear that when that brain thing hit
Grog with his zapper thing, that it rendered him

00:07:30.927 --> 00:07:36.684
unconscious. I would assume that it is a magical
creature, just based on the attack alone.

00:07:36.684 --> 00:07:37.789
LAURA: Thank you, Tiberius.

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:38.844
MARISHA: Anything we should know?

00:07:38.844 --> 00:07:39.762
SAM: Excellent assessment, Tiberius.

00:07:39.762 --> 00:07:40.966
LAURA: Thank you.

00:07:40.966 --> 00:07:41.806
ORION: Quite right.

00:07:41.806 --> 00:07:44.017
TALIESIN: He got zapped and now he's unconscious.

00:07:44.017 --> 00:07:45.318
SAM: A shorter way of saying the same thing.

00:07:45.318 --> 00:07:47.330
LAURA: Maybe we should try-- Does anybody have any
healing? I know Pike isn't here, but--

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.855
MARISHA: I--

00:07:48.855 --> 00:07:49.813
ORION: You have something, don't you?

00:07:49.813 --> 00:07:55.346
MARISHA: I think I have a spell. That might be
able to help. I don't know it right now though.

00:07:55.346 --> 00:08:00.411
We'd have to take a break. I'd have to pull out my
books and relearn it. It takes some time.

00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:02.309
LIAM: How much time do you need?

00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:03.517
MARISHA: Need to sleep on it.

00:08:03.517 --> 00:08:04.233
LAURA: How-- Can we--

00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:06.122
TRAVIS: As they talk, Grog slowly flatulates.

00:08:06.122 --> 00:08:07.856
(all laugh)

00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:09.703
TRAVIS: (fart sound)

00:08:09.703 --> 00:08:10.723
SAM: It happens, it's natural.

00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:11.650
MATT: It's terrible.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.398
LAURA: Oh! It's another-- What is it? An ass
cloud? Is that what it was?

00:08:14.398 --> 00:08:15.762
MATT: Yeah.

00:08:15.762 --> 00:08:16.665
SAM: Poo. Poo cloud.

00:08:16.665 --> 00:08:17.386
LAURA: Lovely.

00:08:17.386 --> 00:08:18.382
LIAM: Everybody make a constitution saving throw.

00:08:18.382 --> 00:08:19.325
LAURA: Yeah, a constitution saving--

00:08:19.325 --> 00:08:21.845
ORION: How many entrances-- How many ways or edges
where we are?

00:08:21.845 --> 00:08:23.714
Because it's like at the center, anyway--

00:08:23.714 --> 00:08:26.664
MATT: Yeah, you're currently basically on the
precipice of a large cavern that has multiple

00:08:26.664 --> 00:08:30.925
layers as the river kind of cascades off into
multiple waterfalls. As far as you can see-- which

00:08:30.975 --> 00:08:35.264
isn't far good because there's no other light
source beyond you guys-- the cavern just continues

00:08:35.264 --> 00:08:38.723
indefinitely for a good 60 feet and then just
vanishes into darkness.

00:08:38.723 --> 00:08:41.360
LAURA: Well, maybe we should sleep. Try to camp
for the time--

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.683
SAM: Well, we'll need to form a perimeter and
someone will have to stand guard--

00:08:44.683 --> 00:08:48.365
MATT: Well, currently you're holding a barely
alive duergar hostage.

00:08:48.365 --> 00:08:50.247
LAURA: (gasps) Oh! Right! I forgot about that!

00:08:50.247 --> 00:08:51.354
SAM: Oh, we gotta interrogate.

00:08:51.354 --> 00:08:53.571
LAURA: We gotta interrogate him! Her.

00:08:53.571 --> 00:08:54.817
LAURA and SAM: It.

00:08:54.817 --> 00:08:55.619
MATT: It's a female.

00:08:55.619 --> 00:08:56.394
LIAM: Female.

00:08:56.394 --> 00:08:57.551
LAURA: And I can speak its language.

00:08:57.551 --> 00:08:58.123
MATT: You do.

00:08:58.123 --> 00:08:58.965
LIAM: Hers.

00:08:58.965 --> 00:08:59.828
MATT: You speak Undercommon.

00:08:59.828 --> 00:09:00.666
LAURA: Hers.

00:09:00.666 --> 00:09:02.592
MATT: First thing you note, too: it is female, and
it takes a moment to

00:09:02.592 --> 00:09:04.228
register that because she is also bald on top.

00:09:04.228 --> 00:09:05.598
LIAM: It. Terrible.

00:09:05.598 --> 00:09:06.587
LAURA: Sorry.

00:09:06.587 --> 00:09:11.058
MATT: Nasty, pale, kind of sunken face. Eyes are
completely clouded over and white, no pupils.

00:09:11.058 --> 00:09:14.908
Teeth are kind of yellow and gnarled and sharp.

00:09:14.908 --> 00:09:19.109
SAM: How close to death's door is she?

00:09:19.109 --> 00:09:19.882
LIAM: What's this?

00:09:19.882 --> 00:09:20.792
LAURA: What?

00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:21.594
LIAM: Thank you, sir.

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:22.797
MARISHA: Oh my gosh.

00:09:22.797 --> 00:09:24.346
LAURA: Oh, thank you, wonderful people!

00:09:24.346 --> 00:09:26.079
CREW: There's more coming, this is the vegan
pizza.

00:09:26.079 --> 00:09:26.962
ORION: Whoa!

00:09:26.962 --> 00:09:27.919
LAURA: What?

00:09:27.919 --> 00:09:29.077
ORION: Where's it coming?

00:09:29.077 --> 00:09:30.301
LAURA: Thank you, chat room!

00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:32.364
TRAVIS: Thank you, chat room.

00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:33.141
ORION: Chat room!

00:09:33.141 --> 00:09:34.322
SAM: Chat room? Chat room bought us a pizza?

00:09:34.322 --> 00:09:35.235
MARISHA: Thanks, guys!

00:09:35.235 --> 00:09:36.297
MATT: You guys are awesome! Thank you so much!

00:09:36.297 --> 00:09:37.326
LIAM: You knew I liked jalapenos.

00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:38.539
LAURA: Vegan pizza? Are you kidding me?

00:09:38.539 --> 00:09:39.735
MARISHA: And donuts!

00:09:39.735 --> 00:09:40.579
MATT: Oh yeah.

00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:41.488
TALIESIN: Pizza made it.

00:09:41.488 --> 00:09:43.194
LAURA: Look at those chocolate cakes! Oh.

00:09:43.194 --> 00:09:45.550
ORION: (laughs) Oh.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.848
SAM: All right, all right. This creature is very
injured.

00:09:48.848 --> 00:09:52.404
I think we need to heal her just enough--

00:09:52.404 --> 00:09:53.302
LAURA: Heal her?

00:09:53.302 --> 00:09:54.210
SAM: Just enough.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:55.252
LIAM: Not so fast, not so fast.

00:09:55.252 --> 00:09:56.794
LAURA: We'll heal her after she talks.

00:09:56.794 --> 00:09:57.712
LIAM: Is she unconscious?

00:09:57.712 --> 00:09:58.859
SAM: Why don't you make that bargain then--

00:09:58.859 --> 00:10:01.090
LIAM: I've got dagger to her throat and I'm hold--
She's bald?

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.107
MATT: Bald, yes.

00:10:02.107 --> 00:10:03.920
LIAM: All right, so I've got an arm around the top
of her forehead in--

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.039
MATT: (hisses)

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:06.325
LAURA: Don't kill her. I need her.

00:10:06.325 --> 00:10:07.406
LIAM: She's not unconscious, right?

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:08.080
MATT: No.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.030
LAURA: I got up--

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.138
MATT: She's got a huge shoulder wound.

00:10:10.138 --> 00:10:12.756
LIAM: All right, I call my sister over. I'll hold
her, you talk.

00:10:12.756 --> 00:10:15.039
LAURA: What did you do to our friend?

00:10:15.039 --> 00:10:21.566
MATT: "I didn't do anything. That was the brain's
work." (chuckles)

00:10:21.566 --> 00:10:23.949
LAURA: What did the brain work do to our friend?

00:10:23.949 --> 00:10:25.025
MARISHA: Brain twerk?

00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:30.111
MATT: "Took care of your friend. He's gone now.
He's all dead inside. Kaputski."

00:10:30.111 --> 00:10:35.577
LAURA: What are you here for?

00:10:35.577 --> 00:10:37.753
MATT: "Just creating a mess."

00:10:37.753 --> 00:10:40.211
LAURA: What should I fucking ask her? I say that
in our language, not--

00:10:40.211 --> 00:10:42.922
(all laugh)

00:10:42.922 --> 00:10:44.180
LAURA: What should I ask?

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.412
TALIESIN: How do we fix it?

00:10:45.412 --> 00:10:48.246
LAURA: How do we-- (lowers voice) How do we fix
it?

00:10:48.246 --> 00:10:49.757
TALIESIN: There you go.

00:10:49.757 --> 00:10:52.666
MATT: "Bury your dead weight."

00:10:52.666 --> 00:10:54.461
LIAM: I press the blade a little tighter.

00:10:54.461 --> 00:10:55.820
MATT: "Ugh! Gah!"

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.239
LIAM: Dig in. Maybe one hit point worth of--

00:10:57.239 --> 00:10:58.590
LAURA: No, no! She's only got one hit point left.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:59.404
LIAM: She's only got one?

00:10:59.404 --> 00:11:00.261
MATT: She's got one hit point.

00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:00.970
LIAM: All right.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:01.779
LAURA: Don't do that!

00:11:01.779 --> 00:11:03.061
(all laugh)

00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:04.395
TALIESIN: Is she bleeding?

00:11:04.395 --> 00:11:05.447
MATT: Profusely. From the shoulder.

00:11:05.447 --> 00:11:08.063
TALIESIN: Oh! In that case, I'm going to cauterize
the wounds.

00:11:08.063 --> 00:11:10.294
There's more than one way to make 
someone talk!

00:11:10.294 --> 00:11:11.064
LAURA: Ugh.

00:11:11.064 --> 00:11:13.135
TALIESIN: I'm going to shoot my gun off-- get it
nice and hot

00:11:13.189 --> 00:11:15.370
right at the tip and start cauterizing the wounds.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:20.056
MATT: Okay so (gunshot). And the flash goes off.
The sound of blast echoes throughout the entirety

00:11:20.056 --> 00:11:23.060
of the cavern. You can hear (echoing gunshot)
cascade off.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.637
MARISHA: A little warning next time!

00:11:24.637 --> 00:11:29.238
MATT: He takes the barrel, slams it into the
shoulder and the sizzling sound as she reaches

00:11:29.238 --> 00:11:32.928
back in pain. Make an intimidation check.

00:11:32.928 --> 00:11:34.159
TALIESIN: I'm intimidated.

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:37.718
LAURA: What should we ask her?

00:11:37.718 --> 00:11:39.224
TALIESIN: Aha ha! 21!

00:11:39.224 --> 00:11:45.505
MATT: 21? All right. She's now, like, breathing
heavy.

00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:50.350
ORION: I'm using my Mage Hand to poke her in the
face.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.866
MATT: She's trying to move her face out of the way
but she can't

00:11:52.866 --> 00:11:55.700
seem to avoid the mystical arcane finger pokes.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.151
(all laugh)

00:11:58.151 --> 00:11:59.711
TALIESIN: Look, we haven't got all day. How do we
fix it--

00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:00.738
LAURA: Who do you work for?

00:12:00.738 --> 00:12:01.989
TALIESIN: And who do you work for?

00:12:01.989 --> 00:12:08.223
MATT: "You fell, surface-slime. You've already
fallen, and the Master's gathered the sheep.

00:12:08.223 --> 00:12:12.042
"You shall all be harvested for K'varn!"

00:12:12.042 --> 00:12:14.847
ORION: Ah, is he a farmer?

00:12:14.847 --> 00:12:16.271
SAM: You can't understand her. Only she can.

00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:17.145
LAURA: You can't understand!

00:12:17.145 --> 00:12:17.793
ORION: Oh.

00:12:17.793 --> 00:12:19.424
LAURA: Who is K'varn? Does anybody know?

00:12:19.424 --> 00:12:20.950
SAM: No, is that a thing? Is that a person?

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.261
LAURA: I don't know. I don't know. I've got--

00:12:22.261 --> 00:12:23.560
TALIESIN: Can I roll history on that or is
that--?

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.480
LAURA: Who is K'varn?

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.252
ORION: The Carvers!

00:12:25.252 --> 00:12:26.252
MATT: You can roll history, if you like.

00:12:26.252 --> 00:12:27.019
TALIESIN: All right.

00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:27.930
LAURA: Argh, who is K'varn?

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:33.464
MATT: "K'varn is the one that rules these caverns.
The one who guides us to take the surface back!"

00:12:33.464 --> 00:12:34.672
LAURA: To take the surface back?

00:12:34.672 --> 00:12:36.517
TALIESIN: A 14 in history wouldn't do anything?

00:12:36.517 --> 00:12:37.400
MATT: No.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:42.838
LAURA: Is K'varn the one making creepy zombie
monsters?

00:12:42.838 --> 00:12:47.189
MATT: "K'varn likes to tinker with the fleshlings,
yes."

00:12:47.254 --> 00:12:50.383
LAURA: Where is K'varn located? Point the
direction.

00:12:50.383 --> 00:12:54.243
MATT: Looks over her shoulder back towards the
darker part of the cavern where you guys haven't

00:12:54.243 --> 00:12:57.715
traversed. "Deep. Deep."

00:12:57.715 --> 00:12:59.280
SAM: What is K'varn?

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.725
LAURA: What. Is. K'varn?

00:13:01.725 --> 00:13:03.400
MATT: "You'll see."

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.625
LAURA: No, you'll tell me now.

00:13:04.625 --> 00:13:06.710
TRAVIS: Good question.

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:07.984
LAURA: I slap her across the face.

00:13:07.984 --> 00:13:08.788
MATT: Argh!

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.471
LAURA: Lightly! Not enough to make her lose a hit
point.

00:13:10.471 --> 00:13:12.883
ORION: I poke her more!

00:13:12.883 --> 00:13:15.436
(all laugh)

00:13:15.436 --> 00:13:17.831
MARISHA: It's like a Three Stooges act.

00:13:17.831 --> 00:13:19.921
MATT: "My life is already forfeit."

00:13:19.972 --> 00:13:20.939
MARISHA: Oh!

00:13:20.939 --> 00:13:27.929
MATT: "I'm just relishing your faces, for they
will be gnarled and twisted soon enough!"

00:13:27.929 --> 00:13:30.409
LAURA: Break her legs. Leave her here.

00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:31.163
MATT: You break her--

00:13:31.163 --> 00:13:32.465
LAURA: Heal her. Maybe we should heal her--

00:13:32.465 --> 00:13:33.433
MATT: (laughs)

00:13:33.433 --> 00:13:35.826
LAURA: And let her lay there. Is that evil? That's
pretty evil.

00:13:35.826 --> 00:13:36.945
TRAVIS: What's your alignment? I mean--

00:13:36.945 --> 00:13:38.246
LAURA: My alignment. I'm good.

00:13:38.246 --> 00:13:39.936
TALIESIN: She did just help--

00:13:39.936 --> 00:13:41.845
MARISHA: Wait! Ask her if she's seen Nostoc. Or if
they've seen--

00:13:41.845 --> 00:13:42.818
LAURA: Oh yes!

00:13:42.818 --> 00:13:46.767
MARISHA: Or, yeah, if they've seen our paladin
friend. Our little--

00:13:46.767 --> 00:13:47.678
TALIESIN: Lady Kima.

00:13:47.678 --> 00:13:50.728
MARISHA: Lady Kima!

00:13:50.728 --> 00:13:56.639
LAURA: Before we end your life, tell us, have you
seen a small halfling?

00:13:56.691 --> 00:14:02.347
MATT: You see a moment of recognition in the
female duergar's face, and it's--

00:14:02.418 --> 00:14:10.837
"There was a halfling, aye. She was foolish enough
to come down here alone. She's dead now."

00:14:10.837 --> 00:14:12.299
SAM: (gasps)

00:14:12.299 --> 00:14:16.352
MATT: "We've taken her life and it was
delicious."

00:14:16.352 --> 00:14:22.233
LIAM: I drag her to her feet. Walk her over to the
edge of the cliff where the water is, and hold

00:14:22.233 --> 00:14:29.926
her. Knife still at her neck. Tell this one: Now's
her last chance to give us anything useful

00:14:29.926 --> 00:14:33.420
to lead to her boss, I guess.

00:14:33.589 --> 00:14:39.222
LAURA: All right. It's your last chance. Give us
something useful? And we'll end this painlessly.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.061
Don't, and we'll make you suffer.

00:14:43.061 --> 00:14:44.253
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

00:14:44.253 --> 00:14:47.414
LAURA: All right. Ooh, my new dice! Ooh! C'mon,
baby!

00:14:47.414 --> 00:14:51.573
LIAM: I'm going to assist her by taking my other
dagger and letting it drip poison down the blade.

00:14:51.573 --> 00:14:52.613
MATT: (laughs)

00:14:52.613 --> 00:14:53.523
LIAM: Advantage? Advantage?

00:14:53.523 --> 00:14:55.110
LAURA: Intimidation of 14?

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.149
LIAM: Assist?

00:14:56.149 --> 00:14:57.811
MATT: Go ahead and roll dice.

00:14:57.811 --> 00:14:58.542
LIAM: Me?

00:14:58.542 --> 00:14:59.370
MATT: You, yes.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:00.385
LAURA: (squeaky voice) To assist me?

00:15:00.385 --> 00:15:01.021
LIAM: 19.

00:15:01.021 --> 00:15:02.186
MATT: 19. Okay, go ahead and roll again.

00:15:02.186 --> 00:15:02.935
LAURA: Oh.

00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:04.033
LIAM: Drip drip drip drip drip.

00:15:04.033 --> 00:15:06.211
MATT: I'm giving you the advantage on the roll
because he has a blade to her now.

00:15:06.211 --> 00:15:08.274
LAURA: Oh, okay. Okay, still 14.

00:15:08.346 --> 00:15:09.461
MATT: Still 14.

00:15:09.461 --> 00:15:11.619
LAURA: I should've rolled my other one. To see.
Just to see.

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:18.689
MATT: She laughs and says: "Your friend's dead!
All is lost! You came for nothing!"

00:15:18.689 --> 00:15:21.359
SAM: Can I tell if she's lying? Is it--

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:22.533
MATT: Make an insight check.

00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:25.856
SAM: Insight check? Oop. No. (laughs)

00:15:25.856 --> 00:15:27.525
LAURA: Okay, can I see if she's lying?

00:15:27.525 --> 00:15:28.407
MATT: You can also make an insight check as well.

00:15:28.407 --> 00:15:30.513
LAURA: All right, cool.

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:32.039
LIAM: I can't understand what the-- What the
hell's she saying?

00:15:32.039 --> 00:15:34.319
LAURA: Okay, that's way better! 24!

00:15:34.319 --> 00:15:37.046
MATT: 24. She is definitively lying through her
teeth.

00:15:37.046 --> 00:15:37.719
LAURA: (gasps)

00:15:37.719 --> 00:15:38.705
MATT: Just to hurt you.

00:15:38.705 --> 00:15:40.702
LAURA: Yes! We know you're lying!

00:15:40.702 --> 00:15:43.437
(all laugh)

00:15:43.437 --> 00:15:44.333
MATT: "What?"

00:15:44.333 --> 00:15:50.406
LAURA: Yes! I don't know what else to ask her,
guys. I don't know what else to ask her.

00:15:50.406 --> 00:15:52.756
TRAVIS: What are goblins afraid of?

00:15:52.756 --> 00:16:00.532
MATT: She looks at you for a second, goes, "Regardless, we
have her. She's down below. And, soon enough,

00:16:00.597 --> 00:16:07.226
"you'll see. You'll see what shall become of this
halfling."

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:14.967
LAURA: We'll rescue her! And we're going to kill
your god!

00:16:14.967 --> 00:16:17.577
(all laugh)

00:16:17.577 --> 00:16:20.597
LIAM: I did it, I did it.

00:16:20.597 --> 00:16:22.968
MATT: An ichor spray comes across.

00:16:22.968 --> 00:16:23.775
SAM: Ugh!

00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:24.912
LAURA: That was the worst thing.

00:16:24.912 --> 00:16:27.531
TALIESIN: The most awkward throat-slitting I've
ever heard of.

00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:28.540
SAM: That was very fast.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.847
MARISHA: We're going to kill your god. Wait.

00:16:30.847 --> 00:16:31.899
TALIESIN: Wait.

00:16:31.899 --> 00:16:33.039
MARISHA: Fuck it, just go with it!

00:16:33.039 --> 00:16:34.280
(all laugh)

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.255
MARISHA: Commit!

00:16:35.255 --> 00:16:37.916
MATT: As the body goes limp in your hands, you
kinda let it tumble over the waterfall.

00:16:37.999 --> 00:16:38.897
LIAM: Yeah.

00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:41.396
LAURA: Good times. Good times, guys.

00:16:41.396 --> 00:16:47.559
MATT: Um, now you guys are standing over Grog in
this kind of makeshift--

00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:49.084
LIAM: It's a little sticky, slimy?

00:16:49.084 --> 00:16:52.006
MATT: -- camp site. The embers of the fire kinda
going low.

00:16:52.006 --> 00:16:53.116
LIAM: I'm starved.

00:16:53.116 --> 00:16:55.334
TALIESIN: Well, she's researching--

00:16:55.334 --> 00:16:56.093
LAURA: Oh!

00:16:56.093 --> 00:16:56.709
MARISHA: Yes.

00:16:56.709 --> 00:16:58.006
LAURA: Should we keep-- I'm going to keep watch.

00:16:58.006 --> 00:16:58.725
LIAM: Absolutely.

00:16:58.725 --> 00:16:59.317
LAURA: With Trinket.

00:16:59.317 --> 00:16:59.944
SAM: We need to--

00:16:59.944 --> 00:17:01.418
MARISHA: Do we have any idea what time it is?

00:17:01.418 --> 00:17:05.343
MATT: At this point? It's at some point in the
evening.

00:17:05.343 --> 00:17:07.224
MARISHA: All right.

00:17:07.224 --> 00:17:11.274
SAM: Let's rest. Let's set up a perimeter and take
turns standing guard.

00:17:11.479 --> 00:17:16.350
I'm going to go to the next cavern over to
where we killed those umber hulks?

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:17.112
MATT: Yes.

00:17:17.112 --> 00:17:19.639
SAM: Take one of the umber hulk heads and put it
on a stick.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.071
LAURA: Ooh.

00:17:21.071 --> 00:17:24.381
SAM: Right out front of where we're-- Of where
we're camping as sort of a warning to others.

00:17:24.436 --> 00:17:25.390
MATT: All right.

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.146
MARISHA: I want to check out--

00:17:26.146 --> 00:17:27.084
LAURA: How about this?

00:17:27.084 --> 00:17:29.638
ORION: How many cavern entrances are there from
where we're camping?

00:17:29.638 --> 00:17:30.571
MATT: From where you are?

00:17:30.571 --> 00:17:31.505
(creepy music sound effect)

00:17:31.505 --> 00:17:32.620
LAURA: Oh no!

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.979
MATT: There are where you came in through--

00:17:33.979 --> 00:17:34.720
ORION: Right.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.756
MATT: Strange things afoot echo in the silence.
There's the entrance you came in. Across the way,

00:17:39.824 --> 00:17:44.306
there appears to be another cavern that you can
kinda see the entrance to. Those are the only proper

00:17:44.306 --> 00:17:50.543
openings into this giant chamber. Otherwise
there's just the giant, over-arching cave that you

00:17:50.786 --> 00:17:53.819
guys are just getting into. Just pushing through,
so--

00:17:53.819 --> 00:17:55.541
MARISHA: I'm gonna take the first watch--

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:56.514
LAURA: Oh, you are! Okay.

00:17:56.514 --> 00:18:00.215
MARISHA: I still have a lot of reading to do, and
I can go ahead-- I'm gonna go ahead and cast--

00:18:00.215 --> 00:18:02.209
Make sure everybody's in! Everybody's in.

00:18:02.209 --> 00:18:03.862
LAURA: Wait, wait! I want to check the bodies of
the other guys before the--

00:18:03.862 --> 00:18:05.121
SAM: What are you casting? What are you about to
cast?

00:18:05.174 --> 00:18:06.000
MATT: Duergar?

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.275
LAURA: Yeah.

00:18:07.326 --> 00:18:08.379
MARISHA: Anti-Life Shell?

00:18:08.379 --> 00:18:09.359
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigative check.

00:18:09.359 --> 00:18:11.308
MARISHA: A shell that keeps in anything from
coming in.

00:18:11.308 --> 00:18:12.507
SAM: Oh. Great. Well, before you do that, hold
on.

00:18:12.507 --> 00:18:13.449
LAURA: A 20?

00:18:13.449 --> 00:18:18.872
MATT: Okay. Glancing about, you pull roughly 125
gold pieces between the three corpses of the

00:18:18.872 --> 00:18:23.400
duergar. Well, two corpses because one of them is
gone. It washed downstream.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.358
LAURA: Right.

00:18:24.358 --> 00:18:25.416
LIAM: She had all the good things.

00:18:25.416 --> 00:18:27.315
LAURA: She had a lot of good stuff on her.

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:34.402
MATT: Yeah. You do, however, find on one of them a
gnarled implement of some kind, whether it be

00:18:34.402 --> 00:18:39.340
scavenged or not. It's of a strange, like almost
bleached bone ivory

00:18:39.501 --> 00:18:42.132
that comes to a point at one end.

00:18:42.196 --> 00:18:44.757
ORION: Ooh.

00:18:44.757 --> 00:18:46.450
SAM: Let's look at it. (laughs)

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:47.649
MATT: It is pretty.

00:18:47.649 --> 00:18:49.154
LAURA: Ooh, let me see, let me see.

00:18:49.154 --> 00:18:51.090
ORION: An artifact we can bring back to--

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.481
SAM: Can I take a look at it and--

00:18:53.481 --> 00:18:55.669
LIAM: Give it to Tiberius. He'll try anything.

00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:57.215
MARISHA: (laughs) He'll try anything.

00:18:57.215 --> 00:18:58.773
SAM: History or-- or arcane?

00:18:58.773 --> 00:18:59.728
ORION: I like trying things.

00:18:59.728 --> 00:19:00.754
MATT: Go ahead and roll arcana.

00:19:00.754 --> 00:19:02.942
SAM: Arcana. No! (laughs)

00:19:02.942 --> 00:19:04.020
MARISHA: (laughs) Oh, Scanlan.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.095
MATT: Scanlan, it is a very pretty something.

00:19:06.095 --> 00:19:07.021
ORION: 24.

00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:15.530
MATT: 24. Want to hand it over to him?

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:16.904
ORION: Yes, I--

00:19:16.904 --> 00:19:17.904
SAM: Ooh!

00:19:17.904 --> 00:19:18.780
LAURA: What is it?

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:19.539
SAM: Nothing.

00:19:19.539 --> 00:19:22.266
ORION: Wonderful, this is. Wonderful. Magic
Missiles, of course.

00:19:22.266 --> 00:19:22.955
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:19:22.955 --> 00:19:24.589
SAM: It sends out magic missiles!

00:19:24.589 --> 00:19:25.446
LAURA: What!

00:19:25.446 --> 00:19:28.932
ORION: This one has seven charges. While holding
it, you, you can use an action to expend one or

00:19:28.932 --> 00:19:32.938
more of its charges to cast the Magic Missile
spell from it. For one charge, you cast the

00:19:32.938 --> 00:19:38.465
first-level version of the spell. You can increase
the spell slot by one for each level by each

00:19:38.518 --> 00:19:44.606
additional charge you expend. The wand regains 1d6
+ 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend

00:19:44.606 --> 00:19:47.823
the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a one, the
wand crumples into ashes and then--

00:19:47.823 --> 00:19:48.863
LIAM: This all seems very technical.

00:19:48.863 --> 00:19:49.806
LAURA: Yes, that's awesome--

00:19:49.806 --> 00:19:51.728
SAM: Basically it shoots out six missiles and then
it--

00:19:51.728 --> 00:19:52.826
LAURA: Awesome!

00:19:52.826 --> 00:19:53.698
TRAVIS: Isn't that a famous, like--

00:19:53.698 --> 00:19:54.601
MARISHA: It goes pew pew!

00:19:54.601 --> 00:19:55.800
LAURA: I'm glad we killed them before they used
that on us.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.714
LIAM: Yes, it's pretty standard.

00:19:56.714 --> 00:19:57.488
TALIESIN: It's a pew pew stick.

00:19:57.488 --> 00:19:58.189
LIAM: Pretty standard.

00:19:58.189 --> 00:19:58.970
MARISHA: It's a pew pew stick!

00:19:58.970 --> 00:19:59.612
LIAM: Yes.

00:19:59.612 --> 00:20:00.160
MARISHA: Cool!

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.551
ORION: Would anybody like to tinker? I mean, I
learned this when I was 12.

00:20:02.551 --> 00:20:04.525
(all laugh)

00:20:04.525 --> 00:20:05.645
LAURA: No, you're unconscious.

00:20:05.645 --> 00:20:07.620
ORION: Oh, I'll hold onto it--

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.107
LAURA: Well, yeah. Yeah.

00:20:09.107 --> 00:20:11.234
LIAM: I think Grog may have soiled himself a
little.

00:20:11.234 --> 00:20:13.707
We should probably get Keyleth on the books.

00:20:13.707 --> 00:20:14.788
LAURA: Take a nap so that, maybe--

00:20:14.788 --> 00:20:15.547
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:18.215
MARISHA: Make sure everyone's in and close by, and
get done with everything.

00:20:18.215 --> 00:20:18.878
LAURA: Okay, she's gonna--

00:20:18.878 --> 00:20:20.232
LIAM: Keyleth, you need to study, so we'll take
first watch.

00:20:20.232 --> 00:20:21.021
MARISHA: I'm gonna take you guys--

00:20:21.021 --> 00:20:22.292
LAURA: Oh, that's true, you should study while we
watch.

00:20:22.292 --> 00:20:23.451
LIAM: You can't study and watch.

00:20:23.451 --> 00:20:28.142
MARISHA: I'm gonna cast Anti-Life Shell. That way
everyone at least gets one good hour of sleep.

00:20:28.232 --> 00:20:29.396
LAURA: Oh, good! I like it!

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:30.247
LIAM: All right, let's take a nap.

00:20:30.247 --> 00:20:31.316
LAURA: All right.

00:20:31.316 --> 00:20:35.244
MATT: You go ahead and you eventually find one of the
corpses of the umber hulk. It takes you a good 25

00:20:35.244 --> 00:20:41.319
minutes to eventually carve through its relatively
thick hide, chitinous exterior. You put the head

00:20:41.319 --> 00:20:46.902
on a makeshift spike, and it is now there on
display.

00:20:46.902 --> 00:20:48.831
SAM: Yes, as a warning to others.

00:20:48.831 --> 00:20:49.798
MATT: You feel accomplished.

00:20:49.798 --> 00:20:50.486
SAM: Yes.

00:20:50.486 --> 00:20:52.653
MATT: You head back. Keyleth--

00:20:52.705 --> 00:20:53.917
TALIESIN: Terrible taxidermy attempt.

00:20:53.917 --> 00:20:57.622
MATT: -- as you are taking first watch, you notice
that the campsite that the duergar were using,

00:20:57.672 --> 00:21:04.024
where you guys are currently resting for the
evening, it's been there for a while and it

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:08.587
looks like the duergar have repurposed it. The
fire-- the stones that were set up around the

00:21:08.587 --> 00:21:12.377
actual fire pit have probably been there for quite
some time, and were set up very uniformly and very

00:21:12.377 --> 00:21:22.047
well placed. Right above you, on one of the stone
walls, you see what appears to be a strange, very

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:28.749
well carved symbol. Hard to recognize it. Go ahead
and make a religion check.

00:21:28.749 --> 00:21:29.708
LAURA: Oh, man.

00:21:29.708 --> 00:21:33.761
MARISHA: Ugh, wish Pike were here.

00:21:33.761 --> 00:21:35.770
LIAM: Yes, we wish Pike was here.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:37.775
LAURA: Pike's missing everything! (sobs)

00:21:37.775 --> 00:21:39.473
TALIESIN: Very much.

00:21:39.641 --> 00:21:41.038
ORION: Yes. We miss you!

00:21:41.038 --> 00:21:42.293
MARISHA: Eight?

00:21:42.293 --> 00:21:43.583
LIAM: Come back, little gnome!

00:21:43.583 --> 00:21:47.374
MATT: It's just a really interesting carving on
the wall just

00:21:47.374 --> 00:21:49.488
right above where you guys are 
currently residing--

00:21:49.488 --> 00:21:50.312
TALIESIN: Ampersand.

00:21:50.312 --> 00:21:51.067
MARISHA: So pretty!

00:21:51.067 --> 00:21:53.686
MATT: Not quite catching your attention, but it
seems to have some significance. And it's fresh,

00:21:53.686 --> 00:21:56.879
it's not like an ancient symbol that's been there,
it maybe could have

00:21:56.879 --> 00:21:58.256
been there for more than a week or two.

00:21:58.256 --> 00:22:01.075
MARISHA: I go ahead and I take a piece of paper
from my spellbook,

00:22:01.075 --> 00:22:07.422
and I take a piece of charcoal, and I just scroll 
over top of it.

00:22:07.422 --> 00:22:08.068
MATT: Okay.

00:22:08.068 --> 00:22:09.275
MARISHA: To get an imprint of it.

00:22:09.275 --> 00:22:13.185
MATT: Okay, it's very big. It's like four feet by
three feet.

00:22:13.185 --> 00:22:15.092
MARISHA: I take a few pieces of paper, and I kind
of glue them together-

00:22:15.092 --> 00:22:17.865
(all laugh)

00:22:17.865 --> 00:22:18.623
MATT: All right.

00:22:18.623 --> 00:22:22.689
MARISHA: -- and then I get a really big one, and
then I roll it up.

00:22:22.689 --> 00:22:31.012
MATT: All right. All right, you guys begin to set
up for the next watch. After the first hour--

00:22:31.012 --> 00:22:32.407
MARISHA: And I have my Anti-Life Shell up.

00:22:32.407 --> 00:22:36.042
MATT: Yep, Anti-Life Shell eventually fades, first
hour without any impact or issue.

00:22:36.042 --> 00:22:37.534
MARISHA: Who is taking the next watch?

00:22:37.534 --> 00:22:38.779
LAURA: Oh, we are.

00:22:38.779 --> 00:22:39.586
LIAM: Yeah.

00:22:39.586 --> 00:22:44.139
MATT: Okay. The next few hours go by without
incident.

00:22:44.139 --> 00:22:50.009
LAURA: That's nice. Can I look around and see-- I
mean, no! In our area! I'm not gonna wander off,

00:22:50.009 --> 00:22:57.698
but just to see if I see any kind of anything
interesting. I mean, if this is a really old area

00:22:57.698 --> 00:23:02.101
that I've noticed, it's old, can I see anything
cool and old around us?

00:23:02.101 --> 00:23:08.367
MATT: Well, there's a lot of mineral deposits.
This place in particular, it's definitely, because

00:23:08.367 --> 00:23:13.643
of the heavy river flow for a long time, a lot of
the area near the river itself, very smooth stone.

00:23:13.643 --> 00:23:17.014
A lot of kind of accumulated deposits of various
elements.

00:23:17.014 --> 00:23:24.027
You also catch the strange carved symbol right 
atop your guys' camp.

00:23:24.027 --> 00:23:28.743
LAURA: Okay. So I tap my brother and go, look at
this. Do you know anything about religion?

00:23:28.743 --> 00:23:31.014
LIAM: (sighs) Well, let me see.

00:23:31.014 --> 00:23:31.829
LAURA: Let me see.

00:23:31.829 --> 00:23:34.321
(all laugh)

00:23:34.321 --> 00:23:35.977
LIAM: Well, I seem to know fuck-all about it.
Ten.

00:23:35.977 --> 00:23:37.470
LAURA: Oh, me too! I know shit about it.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.284
MATT: It's a very fancy symbol.

00:23:39.284 --> 00:23:40.657
LAURA: It's a really pretty symbol.

00:23:40.657 --> 00:23:43.392
MATT: You guys finish your watch--

00:23:43.392 --> 00:23:45.340
LIAM: I really wish Pike was here.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.282
MARISHA: Just, the party is taking turns being
like, so pretty!

00:23:47.282 --> 00:23:48.139
LAURA: I know!

00:23:48.139 --> 00:23:49.427
SAM: Where was that symbol?

00:23:49.427 --> 00:23:50.277
LAURA: On a rock.

00:23:50.277 --> 00:23:50.920
MARISHA: It's above our--

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.178
MATT: It's on one of the large cave surfaces near
where you guys are camping.

00:23:53.178 --> 00:23:57.587
LAURA: I don't see any cool sparkly things in the
mineral deposits? None of that?

00:23:57.587 --> 00:23:58.697
MATT: Nothing catches your attention--

00:23:58.697 --> 00:23:59.342
LAURA: Damn it!

00:23:59.342 --> 00:24:00.890
MATT: --- at the moment, no, unfortunately.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:01.591
LIAM: All about the bling.

00:24:01.591 --> 00:24:02.828
LAURA: I am about the bling.

00:24:02.828 --> 00:24:04.075
MARISHA: How's it going over there, Grog?

00:24:04.075 --> 00:24:05.264
MATT: You finish your watch without issue.

00:24:05.264 --> 00:24:06.106
MARISHA: It's good.

00:24:06.106 --> 00:24:08.645
MATT: Next up watch, this is the last, third, and
final watch you guys are now going through.

00:24:08.645 --> 00:24:09.420
ORION: Oh, all right.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.615
SAM: I'll come with Tiberius as well.

00:24:10.615 --> 00:24:11.173
MATT: Okay.

00:24:11.173 --> 00:24:12.387
TALIESIN: Yeah, we'll all go.

00:24:12.438 --> 00:24:13.300
SAM: Okay.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:18.386
MATT: Okay. The three of you guys keep watch.
After they're napping. Occasionally you have to

00:24:18.386 --> 00:24:20.753
adjust Grog, 'cause you're not sure if he's still
breathing.

00:24:20.753 --> 00:24:21.901
ORION: I'll roll for the--

00:24:21.901 --> 00:24:23.044
TRAVIS: What?

00:24:23.044 --> 00:24:24.947
SAM: Not sure if he's still breathing?

00:24:24.947 --> 00:24:26.102
ORION: I'm gonna do an intelligence, right?

00:24:26.102 --> 00:24:26.835
MATT: To make sure he's still--

00:24:26.835 --> 00:24:27.529
LAURA: What?

00:24:27.529 --> 00:24:28.489
MARISHA: Religion. Religion.

00:24:28.489 --> 00:24:29.122
MATT: Religion.

00:24:29.122 --> 00:24:30.110
ORION: 20.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.437
LAURA: Oh my god, what if you could die while
we're sleeping?

00:24:31.437 --> 00:24:32.246
MATT: Right now, you just rolled?

00:24:32.246 --> 00:24:33.141
ORION: Well, 18 plus two.

00:24:33.141 --> 00:24:34.559
MATT: Oh, okay.

00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:35.420
ORION: What's that?

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.118
MATT: You are familiar with this symbol
specifically because of your background. That is

00:24:38.118 --> 00:24:40.720
the symbol of Bahamut. It is the symbol of the
Platinum Dragon.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.064
LAURA: Ooh!

00:24:42.064 --> 00:24:44.894
MATT: And you ascertain it was probably--

00:24:44.894 --> 00:24:46.277
ORION: Oh, it looks like this!

00:24:46.277 --> 00:24:46.988
MATT: Yes.

00:24:46.988 --> 00:24:47.820
ORION: Oh, interesting.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:52.384
MATT: And it was probably used as part of some
sort of a protection ritual.

00:24:52.384 --> 00:24:55.323
LAURA: What was the name of the bad guy that she
said?

00:24:55.323 --> 00:24:56.863
MATT: K'varn.

00:24:56.863 --> 00:24:58.566
ORION: I tell everybody that. Well, that I'm
with.

00:24:58.566 --> 00:24:59.412
LAURA: Thank you.

00:24:59.412 --> 00:25:00.729
MATT: Using the thing you wrote.

00:25:00.729 --> 00:25:01.764
LAURA: K'varn.

00:25:01.764 --> 00:25:02.730
MATT: K'varn.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:04.676
LAURA: I'm gonna guess that's how you spell it.

00:25:04.676 --> 00:25:07.737
ORION: It seems it's a protective symbol of sorts,
but it's of Bahamut, which is a good thing.

00:25:07.737 --> 00:25:09.616
LAURA: K'vah? I thought it was K'varn.

00:25:09.616 --> 00:25:10.440
SAM: It's a good thing?

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.301
ORION: Bahamut is the essentially nicer deity of
the two between him

00:25:14.301 --> 00:25:16.985
and Tiamat, which is a total asshole, but--

00:25:16.985 --> 00:25:20.164
SAM: Well that must be why Lady Kima came down
here.

00:25:20.164 --> 00:25:23.761
ORION: Right. So she must have camped here, put
this symbol up for protection.

00:25:23.761 --> 00:25:28.421
MATT: As you are having this discussion, you feel
a slight rumble in the ground.

00:25:28.421 --> 00:25:29.408
TRAVIS: Fucked up now.

00:25:29.408 --> 00:25:31.117
MARISHA: Oh no.

00:25:31.117 --> 00:25:34.128
MATT: Some of the rocks nearby, the loose pebbles,
begin to vibrate and move around.

00:25:34.128 --> 00:25:35.240
ORION: Oh dear.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.971
SAM: Grog's probably farting again.

00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:40.078
ORION: No, I don't think-- I think we should alert
the others.

00:25:40.078 --> 00:25:41.017
SAM: All right.

00:25:41.017 --> 00:25:43.792
LAURA: We're waking up, we're waking up. Don't
worry, we are gonna heal you.

00:25:43.792 --> 00:25:44.820
ORION: How far are we from everybody? We're just
like--

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:45.974
MATT: You guys are all clustered in the small
camp.

00:25:45.974 --> 00:25:46.722
ORION: Oh.

00:25:46.722 --> 00:25:50.621
SAM: Let's quietly wake them, and I will go peer
into the darkness and see if I can see them.

00:25:50.621 --> 00:25:53.914
ORION: Rumbling is never a good thing, Scanlan.

00:25:53.914 --> 00:25:55.378
LAURA: Something's rumbling? I wasn't paying
attention.

00:25:55.378 --> 00:25:57.362
MATT: Do you still have your light source up,
Light, or you just, the campfire?

00:25:57.362 --> 00:25:58.613
ORION: Just the campfire.

00:25:58.613 --> 00:26:02.539
MATT: Yeah, you are-- outside of just, maybe 15,
20 feet, you see nothing. It's pitch black.

00:26:02.539 --> 00:26:06.194
TALIESIN: Let's wake everybody up, and then we'll
get to work--

00:26:06.194 --> 00:26:07.425
LAURA: On healing Grog?

00:26:07.425 --> 00:26:09.099
TALIESIN: -- on Grog, and go see what that is.

00:26:09.099 --> 00:26:10.422
LAURA: I'm not awake yet.

00:26:10.422 --> 00:26:11.812
TALIESIN: Is all this going at the same time?

00:26:11.812 --> 00:26:13.720
SAM: Is the rumbling continuous, or is it just one
little rumble?

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.076
MATT: A few moments pass, the rumbling has
subsided.

00:26:16.076 --> 00:26:16.896
SAM: Oh, okay.

00:26:16.896 --> 00:26:17.598
ORION: Oh, it stopped.

00:26:17.598 --> 00:26:18.596
SAM: Oh, easy!

00:26:18.596 --> 00:26:19.470
LAURA: So we're awake.

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:20.459
MARISHA: Okay, but let's--

00:26:20.459 --> 00:26:21.579
LAURA: Let's heal this guy. Can you heal him?

00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:22.791
MARISHA: Am I awake? Are we awake? Did you wake me
up?

00:26:22.791 --> 00:26:23.588
LAURA: Are we awake?

00:26:23.588 --> 00:26:24.622
ORION: I do Prestidigitation and wake everybody
up--

00:26:24.622 --> 00:26:26.068
LAURA: (grunts) Awake.

00:26:26.068 --> 00:26:27.622
ORION: -- with a little spritz of water in the
face.

00:26:27.622 --> 00:26:28.503
MATT: Okay, all wake up--

00:26:28.503 --> 00:26:30.031
ORION: Everybody get up!

00:26:30.031 --> 00:26:31.109
SAM: Like the flower, the flower trick?

00:26:31.109 --> 00:26:32.301
MARISHA: Why water? Why would you do that?

00:26:32.301 --> 00:26:33.087
ORION: Yeah.

00:26:33.087 --> 00:26:34.498
MARISHA: Why couldn't you just touch me?

00:26:34.498 --> 00:26:35.343
TALIESIN: Magic bukkake.

00:26:35.343 --> 00:26:36.072
ORION: Because it's--

00:26:36.072 --> 00:26:36.971
LAURA: Ah, that was a good nap!

00:26:36.971 --> 00:26:37.808
LIAM: Stupid lizard.

00:26:37.808 --> 00:26:38.574
MARISHA: Ugh.

00:26:38.574 --> 00:26:39.784
LAURA: I think Grog farted again.

00:26:39.784 --> 00:26:40.794
ORION: I do it again, and clean everybody up.

00:26:40.794 --> 00:26:41.720
MARISHA: Stop!

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.404
ORION: Sorry. sorry! It's off. I--

00:26:43.404 --> 00:26:44.331
SAM: Something terrible is brewing.

00:26:44.331 --> 00:26:45.566
LAURA: Keyleth-- no, what?

00:26:45.566 --> 00:26:48.733
SAM: How is everyone feeling? Do we need to heal?
Everyone?

00:26:48.733 --> 00:26:49.729
LAURA: We need to heal this guy.

00:26:49.729 --> 00:26:50.925
SAM: No, what about us? How are we feeling?

00:26:50.925 --> 00:26:51.822
LIAM: Well, we all just slept, so we're fine.

00:26:51.822 --> 00:26:52.806
LAURA: We're fine! Heal this guy!

00:26:52.806 --> 00:26:53.499
MARISHA: I'm okay.

00:26:53.499 --> 00:26:54.411
SAM: Are we okay?

00:26:54.411 --> 00:26:55.451
MATT: You've all slept for the evening--

00:26:55.451 --> 00:26:56.271
ORION: Oh, awesome.

00:26:56.271 --> 00:26:57.735
MATT: --and from the points of your unused--

00:26:57.735 --> 00:26:59.813
LAURA: Grog, just wait a little bit longer.

00:26:59.813 --> 00:27:01.811
MATT: -- healing dice, you're pretty much all at
max health, so.

00:27:01.811 --> 00:27:02.649
LAURA: You'll be okay.

00:27:02.649 --> 00:27:04.712
MARISHA: Okay, do we wanna stay here? Do we wanna
do this here?

00:27:04.712 --> 00:27:05.494
LAURA: Yeah! Do it here!

00:27:05.494 --> 00:27:06.219
TALIESIN: Do this here.

00:27:06.219 --> 00:27:08.863
ORION: There was a rumble. Okay, we need to get
Grog, the others, and--

00:27:08.863 --> 00:27:10.393
LAURA: How long will this take, Keyleth?

00:27:10.393 --> 00:27:16.024
MARISHA: Tiberius-- I don't know. But I want us to
be as safe as we can. Tiberius, can you lift us up

00:27:16.024 --> 00:27:18.194
on your pillars, or like, encase us in, or
something? Make us a room?

00:27:18.194 --> 00:27:20.130
ORION: I was just about to do that!

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.558
MARISHA: Make us a room?

00:27:21.558 --> 00:27:22.169
ORION: Yes!

00:27:22.169 --> 00:27:23.477
MARISHA: Yes? Okay.

00:27:23.477 --> 00:27:24.672
ORION: But everybody hates when I do that.

00:27:24.672 --> 00:27:25.900
SAM: Are you gonna cast a spell now?

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.317
MARISHA: We're gonna do this.

00:27:27.317 --> 00:27:31.388
SAM: Okay, I'd like to give her a little
inspirational song.

00:27:31.388 --> 00:27:32.555
MARISHA: Yes, if you could.

00:27:32.555 --> 00:27:33.295
MATT: All right.

00:27:33.295 --> 00:27:37.129
MARISHA: Scanlan, give me some nice meditation,
some--

00:27:37.129 --> 00:27:39.001
SAM: Okay, some, like, yoga music?

00:27:39.001 --> 00:27:40.563
MARISHA: Some, like, pure moods. Yes! Yes.

00:27:40.563 --> 00:27:43.532
LAURA: Trinket gives her a massage beforehand to
loosen her up.

00:27:43.582 --> 00:27:44.660
MARISHA: I go ahead--

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.393
SAM: (sings) You know you got to cure Grog.

00:27:48.393 --> 00:27:52.010
MARISHA: I go ahead and light some incense.

00:27:52.173 --> 00:27:53.180
ORION: Wonderful tune.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:59.614
MARISHA: Scanlan. Scanlan, do you still have that
deity, that little idol of Pike?

00:27:59.614 --> 00:28:01.967
SAM: I do have my idol of Pike, yes!

00:28:01.967 --> 00:28:04.030
MARISHA: Can we just have that out just so I have
her energy.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.538
SAM: Oh, of course!

00:28:05.538 --> 00:28:06.571
MARISHA: Just feel like I need her.

00:28:06.571 --> 00:28:08.720
SAM: I take out the idol of Pike that I keep
always close to my loins,

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.961
and I hold it tightly, and warmly--

00:28:11.961 --> 00:28:12.568
MARISHA: Okay.

00:28:12.568 --> 00:28:14.501
SAM: -- and caress it a little.

00:28:14.501 --> 00:28:15.798
ORION: Give it to her.

00:28:15.798 --> 00:28:19.416
MATT: It is momentarily distracting, but
eventually you phase it out.

00:28:19.416 --> 00:28:20.497
All right, so as you guys--

00:28:20.497 --> 00:28:21.421
(all laugh)

00:28:21.421 --> 00:28:23.337
ORION: Did you want my hand or the statue?

00:28:23.337 --> 00:28:26.239
MATT: You take a bit of earth from a pouch that
you keep of your--

00:28:26.239 --> 00:28:27.038
ORION: Statue.

00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:31.380
MATT: -- home tribe where you grew up. You
scattered some of it around Grog, who is now laid

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.022
on his back, whose arms and legs, all equally
stretched out.

00:28:34.022 --> 00:28:35.017
TRAVIS: Naked.

00:28:35.017 --> 00:28:36.473
MATT: No. You're still clothed.

00:28:36.473 --> 00:28:39.245
(all laugh)

00:28:39.245 --> 00:28:41.542
MARISHA: Let's not go there. No need to be naked.

00:28:41.542 --> 00:28:42.899
LAURA: There's coffee next to you.

00:28:42.899 --> 00:28:47.473
MATT: As this is the first time you've attempted a
magic of this type, you close your eyes and take

00:28:47.473 --> 00:28:51.983
in the earth's essence. As a druid, being
connected to nature is

00:28:51.983 --> 00:28:54.578
where you draw your divine energy. You kind of--

00:28:54.578 --> 00:28:55.434
MARISHA: I'm so nervous.

00:28:55.434 --> 00:29:00.158
MATT: -- almost take from the vibration of the
nearby caverns that you felt, and come in tune

00:29:00.225 --> 00:29:03.334
with the way the earth, the planet itself shifts
and moves, you--

00:29:03.334 --> 00:29:04.446
LIAM: You got this, Keyleth! You got this!

00:29:04.446 --> 00:29:05.708
LAURA: You can do this Keyleth! You can do this!

00:29:05.708 --> 00:29:06.782
MARISHA: I'm literally shaking.

00:29:06.782 --> 00:29:09.767
MATT: You use that to give constitutional strength
to the physical form

00:29:09.767 --> 00:29:11.861
of Grog in hopes of restoring him.

00:29:11.861 --> 00:29:13.970
MARISHA: Okay, I just kind of lay my hands on his
forehead.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:16.274
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

00:29:16.274 --> 00:29:25.197
SAM: You know, I know Grog very well, and he might
enjoy, or be inspired by, a kiss of a female. I'm

00:29:25.197 --> 00:29:31.595
just saying, just the gentle kiss of a female lips
on his might rouse him.

00:29:31.595 --> 00:29:32.517
ORION: Ooh, Vex!

00:29:32.517 --> 00:29:33.522
SAM: I've seen it many times.

00:29:33.522 --> 00:29:34.456
ORION: You should plant one on him.

00:29:34.456 --> 00:29:37.866
SAM: Vex? Get in there! Get in there!

00:29:37.866 --> 00:29:39.545
(all laugh)

00:29:39.545 --> 00:29:41.787
MATT: As Vex awkwardly fumbles over the--

00:29:41.787 --> 00:29:42.862
LAURA: I think it helped.

00:29:42.862 --> 00:29:47.542
MATT: -- the overtly sized goliath-

00:29:47.542 --> 00:29:50.773
LAURA: Stop it.

00:29:50.773 --> 00:29:52.742
TRAVIS: Not all dead.

00:29:52.742 --> 00:29:55.254
MATT: Go ahead and--

00:29:55.254 --> 00:29:56.792
LIAM: Just upstairs.

00:29:56.792 --> 00:29:58.256
MARISHA: Do I get an inspiration die from him or
anything?

00:29:58.256 --> 00:29:59.009
MATT: You do, yes.

00:29:59.009 --> 00:30:01.310
MARISHA: Okay. What am I rolling? What do I do?

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:02.439
MATT: Roll a d20, add your wisdom modifier.

00:30:02.439 --> 00:30:03.841
LAURA: Do I get to assist since I gave him a
kiss?

00:30:03.841 --> 00:30:06.580
MATT: No assistance on this. This only affects a
d20 roll.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:07.735
SAM: d20.

00:30:07.735 --> 00:30:09.211
LAURA: Oh god.

00:30:09.211 --> 00:30:10.071
TALIESIN: It's a wisdom modifier.

00:30:10.071 --> 00:30:11.172
SAM: Let's do this, man.

00:30:11.172 --> 00:30:11.911
LIAM: Save Grog!

00:30:11.911 --> 00:30:13.372
LAURA: Save Grog. Save Grog!

00:30:13.372 --> 00:30:14.408
SAM: For the chat room.

00:30:14.408 --> 00:30:19.884
MARISHA: Gah. Nauseous. No.

00:30:19.884 --> 00:30:23.057
MATT: What'd you roll? What'd you roll?

00:30:23.057 --> 00:30:24.502
LAURA: No!

00:30:24.502 --> 00:30:26.489
MARISHA: Where's the inspiration die? Where's the
inspiration die?

00:30:26.489 --> 00:30:27.521
ORION: Didn't you get advantage on that?

00:30:27.521 --> 00:30:28.247
MARISHA: It's a d8, right?

00:30:28.247 --> 00:30:28.973
MATT: It's a d8.

00:30:28.973 --> 00:30:30.418
MARISHA: Do I get advantage on this, since I'm
taking time?

00:30:30.418 --> 00:30:31.059
LAURA: Yes!

00:30:31.059 --> 00:30:32.672
MATT: As is, yes, yeah, you have advantage on the
roll, yeah!

00:30:32.672 --> 00:30:33.617
MARISHA: I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have advantage on this?

00:30:33.617 --> 00:30:34.934
LAURA: Come on, Keyleth! Keyleth, Keyleth,
Keyleth!

00:30:34.934 --> 00:30:37.961
ORION: Yeah!

00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:38.983
MARISHA: Oh, that's much better!

00:30:38.983 --> 00:30:39.913
LAURA: What? What was it?

00:30:39.913 --> 00:30:42.703
MARISHA: I'm still gonna do the inspiration dice,
just in casies. Okay, that's good.

00:30:42.703 --> 00:30:43.350
TALIESIN: That's good.

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:44.136
MARISHA: Okay, so.

00:30:44.136 --> 00:30:45.012
MATT: What's the total?

00:30:45.012 --> 00:30:46.218
MARISHA: 17 plus 12.

00:30:46.218 --> 00:30:47.435
MATT: Plus 12?

00:30:47.435 --> 00:30:53.245
MARISHA: Plus six, plus six with my wisdom
modifier. My heart is pounding.

00:30:53.245 --> 00:30:56.920
So that's 30? No, 29.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.563
MATT: 29, that should be enough.

00:30:58.563 --> 00:30:59.582
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

00:30:59.582 --> 00:31:07.058
MATT: So, (laughs), in this circumstance, you
complete the ritual.

00:31:07.058 --> 00:31:09.264
There's a brief glow of all the--

00:31:09.264 --> 00:31:11.135
MARISHA: Ah, I'm still shaking.

00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:14.361
MATT: The dirt that you'd scattered around Grog,
and you can see his form kind of take in a deeper

00:31:14.361 --> 00:31:19.470
breath. His chest expands, and as it does, his
eyes, which currently stare off in space, begin to

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:23.815
clarify and crystallize and his brow quivers for a
second,

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:27.419
and you see a little bit of life return to his face.

00:31:27.419 --> 00:31:32.168
TRAVIS: Ugh. Kittens. Ugh. Nachos. Ugh.

00:31:32.168 --> 00:31:33.213
SAM: (laughs)

00:31:33.213 --> 00:31:33.874
MARISHA: Grog?

00:31:33.874 --> 00:31:35.561
MATT: Grog, your sight focuses as the party is
gathered around you, looking down upon your

00:31:35.561 --> 00:31:39.435
currently stretched out physical form in a cavern.
You're very confused.

00:31:39.435 --> 00:31:40.592
LIAM: Welcome back, big guy.

00:31:40.592 --> 00:31:43.785
TRAVIS: I thought I was in algebra class again for
a second there.

00:31:43.785 --> 00:31:44.861
(all laugh)

00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:45.705
MARISHA: Grog!

00:31:45.705 --> 00:31:48.184
SAM: You're alive!

00:31:48.184 --> 00:31:49.223
ORION: Why are you all cheering?

00:31:49.223 --> 00:31:50.074
LAURA: Good job, Keyleth!

00:31:50.074 --> 00:31:53.861
ORION: Why did you run out and destroy nothing?
Look what you did. You were giving me crap about

00:31:53.861 --> 00:31:55.683
the lightning. Don't ever do that again.

00:31:55.683 --> 00:31:58.577
TRAVIS: Sorry, who woke me up from my sleep?

00:31:58.639 --> 00:32:00.278
(electronic beep)

00:32:00.343 --> 00:32:01.790
LAURA: Oh, Siri did, apparently.

00:32:01.844 --> 00:32:04.021
ORION: It was a group effort really, but Keyleth
did an amazing job.

00:32:04.021 --> 00:32:07.309
TRAVIS: Keyleth? I run over and I give Keyleth a
big ol' bear hug,

00:32:07.309 --> 00:32:08.828
squeezing maybe a bit too tight.

00:32:08.828 --> 00:32:09.646
MARISHA: Ow.

00:32:09.646 --> 00:32:10.708
LAURA: I think he shit himself while he was
unconscious,

00:32:10.708 --> 00:32:13.508
so that's gotta smell really wonderful.

00:32:13.508 --> 00:32:17.968
TRAVIS: I smell better than I ever have before.

00:32:17.968 --> 00:32:23.164
MARISHA: Just glad you're all right, Grog. Really
glad you're awake.

00:32:23.164 --> 00:32:26.643
TRAVIS: I reach into the bag of holding and I get
the cask of ale and my goblet,

00:32:26.643 --> 00:32:30.555
and I pour a little goblet of ale and I give it 
to Keyleth.

00:32:30.555 --> 00:32:31.738
MARISHA: To Grog!

00:32:31.738 --> 00:32:33.437
ALL: To Grog!

00:32:33.437 --> 00:32:34.632
TRAVIS: To me!

00:32:34.632 --> 00:32:36.773
(all laugh)

00:32:36.773 --> 00:32:41.926
MATT: As a note too, just so you guys are aware,
20 is the stat cap for normal physical stats,

00:32:41.926 --> 00:32:46.889
however magical items can then bump that up
higher. Just answering a chat room question.

00:32:46.889 --> 00:32:48.447
LAURA: Right.

00:32:48.447 --> 00:32:51.233
SAM: I don't even know what that means. Question
or the answer.

00:32:51.233 --> 00:32:52.852
MATT: That's okay. Don't worry about it.

00:32:52.852 --> 00:32:54.643
SAM: Hey. How is he doing, how is he feeling?

00:32:54.643 --> 00:32:55.827
TRAVIS: I'm so glad you had advantage on that.

00:32:55.827 --> 00:32:56.973
SAM: Grog, how are you feeling?

00:32:56.973 --> 00:32:57.743
ORION: Yes!

00:32:57.743 --> 00:32:58.620
SAM: How is he feeling?

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.268
TRAVIS: My intelligence is--

00:33:00.268 --> 00:33:01.718
What is it now?

00:33:01.769 --> 00:33:02.657
MATT: It's back to normal.

00:33:02.657 --> 00:33:04.167
MARISHA: At like the gym and you need some
alcohol, after that.

00:33:04.167 --> 00:33:05.221
TRAVIS: It's six, so--

00:33:05.221 --> 00:33:06.275
SAM: Right where it should be.

00:33:06.275 --> 00:33:09.359
TRAVIS: I feel right as rain. What are we
killing?

00:33:09.359 --> 00:33:11.080
(all laugh)

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.047
LIAM: Brains, apparently.

00:33:12.047 --> 00:33:14.400
SAM: How many fingers is this?

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.023
TRAVIS: Three.

00:33:15.023 --> 00:33:15.926
SAM: Perfect.

00:33:15.926 --> 00:33:17.784
MARISHA: Good, he's back, you guys. He's back.

00:33:17.784 --> 00:33:19.156
TRAVIS: Blue, oh no, hold on.

00:33:19.156 --> 00:33:20.095
MARISHA: Good.

00:33:20.095 --> 00:33:20.990
TRAVIS: Square!

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:24.802
ORION: I saunter over to Keyleth. That was mighty
impressive.

00:33:24.802 --> 00:33:25.919
MARISHA: Oh, thank you.

00:33:25.919 --> 00:33:27.249
ORION: That was amazing.

00:33:27.249 --> 00:33:29.714
MARISHA: I had Pike in mind. I channeled her
energy.

00:33:29.714 --> 00:33:32.403
SAM: It's true, it was quite astounding. I have a
little chub on.

00:33:32.403 --> 00:33:33.236
LAURA: (groans)

00:33:33.236 --> 00:33:34.554
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:33:34.554 --> 00:33:36.331
So do I, for some reason.

00:33:36.331 --> 00:33:38.395
LAURA: You're welcome.

00:33:38.395 --> 00:33:39.771
MARISHA: Yeah well, that's a bit of a side
effect.

00:33:39.821 --> 00:33:40.965
TRAVIS: It must be the morning.

00:33:40.965 --> 00:33:43.147
MARISHA: That's part of the Greater Restoration, a
few things get restored.

00:33:43.147 --> 00:33:44.481
MATT: (laughs)

00:33:44.481 --> 00:33:46.053
TRAVIS: God bless you.

00:33:46.053 --> 00:33:49.160
LIAM: Do you remember anything about a kiss in
your dreams while you were asleep?

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:53.492
TRAVIS: Well, my cheeks are sort of sore for some
reason, as if they've been slapped repeatedly by a

00:33:53.492 --> 00:33:57.266
bunch of twats, and then I've got this one little
wet mark right here

00:33:57.266 --> 00:34:01.875
where I got a kiss and it smells like 
half-elvish spit.

00:34:01.875 --> 00:34:04.490
LIAM: Oh, that was Trinket. Trinket helped with
the spell.

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:05.705
Gave you a kiss and helped wake you up.

00:34:05.705 --> 00:34:07.106
LAURA: Oh, why didn't I have Trinket--

00:34:07.106 --> 00:34:08.429
TALIESIN: And several slaps.

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:09.961
MATT: At which point you look over and Trinket is
there off to the side,

00:34:09.961 --> 00:34:12.825
notably excited that you're moving again. 
(bear noises)

00:34:12.825 --> 00:34:14.209
LAURA: Aw.

00:34:14.209 --> 00:34:16.329
MATT: Comes over and nuzzles up against you for a
moment.

00:34:16.329 --> 00:34:20.780
TRAVIS: Oh Trinket, you big ol' furball. 
Trinket noogie.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.672
LAURA: (laughs)

00:34:22.672 --> 00:34:24.014
TRAVIS: Can we go kill something now?

00:34:24.014 --> 00:34:26.783
LAURA: Well shit, I guess we should. I think we
are all healed up.

00:34:26.783 --> 00:34:28.091
MATT: You guys all healed overnight.

00:34:28.091 --> 00:34:30.599
LAURA: Did he heal while he was unconscious?

00:34:30.599 --> 00:34:33.699
MATT: You did not get an opportunity to use any of
your stuff, so you're currently still at the hit

00:34:33.867 --> 00:34:36.460
points you were, plus you naturally healed just
from the evening's rest.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.014
TRAVIS: Oh, I did?

00:34:38.014 --> 00:34:40.266
MATT: Four hit points.

00:34:40.266 --> 00:34:45.129
SAM: Let's do some Grog healing. You don't have
your healing dice, right?

00:34:45.129 --> 00:34:46.418
TRAVIS: I do.

00:34:46.418 --> 00:34:53.637
SAM: I'm gonna sing a song of rest for you, so
that'll add 1d6 to your healing rolls.

00:34:53.637 --> 00:35:01.858
TRAVIS: Yes! 11 plus-- All right. 12. Great.

00:35:01.858 --> 00:35:05.868
LAURA: How many d12s do you get to roll? You can
roll four of them if you need to.

00:35:05.936 --> 00:35:08.111
TRAVIS: (counts)

00:35:08.111 --> 00:35:09.325
MATT: You can roll up to nine.

00:35:09.325 --> 00:35:10.731
LAURA: You can roll up to nine dice.

00:35:10.753 --> 00:35:11.658
TRAVIS: Oh!

00:35:11.658 --> 00:35:13.160
MATT: Whatever your level is, that's how many dice
you can use.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.579
TRAVIS: Nipple tassels! That's way better.

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:15.888
(all laugh)

00:35:15.888 --> 00:35:19.360
MATT: But that's for the day. Once you've used those
nine hit dice to heal yourself naturally, you are

00:35:19.427 --> 00:35:21.751
maxed out outside of magical healing or potions.

00:35:21.751 --> 00:35:22.797
TRAVIS: I've used two.

00:35:22.797 --> 00:35:24.520
SAM: Shall we tarry on, everyone?

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.201
LIAM: Yes, I have a feeling these tunnels are
going to suck majorly,

00:35:27.277 --> 00:35:30.283
but we have nowhere to go but down, so--

00:35:30.283 --> 00:35:32.755
LAURA: So we know which tunnel she pointed
towards?

00:35:32.755 --> 00:35:36.547
MATT: She pointed towards the rest of the cavern,
which you have just stepped into.

00:35:36.718 --> 00:35:42.302
LAURA: Can I use tracking and see if I can not
only see where the majority of tracks lead to, but

00:35:42.302 --> 00:35:47.556
see if I can spot the halfling Kima's tracks.

00:35:47.556 --> 00:35:49.606
MATT: Lady Kima. Go ahead and make a survival
check.

00:35:49.606 --> 00:35:51.288
LAURA: Survival?

00:35:51.288 --> 00:35:54.296
MATT: Which you have advantage on simply for
tracking depending on what you're tracking.

00:35:54.296 --> 00:35:55.994
LAURA: I do!

00:35:55.994 --> 00:35:58.533
MATT: What are your favored enemies?

00:35:58.584 --> 00:36:02.858
LAURA: My favored enemies are dragons and demons.

00:36:02.858 --> 00:36:04.627
MATT: So you would not have advantage on this.

00:36:04.627 --> 00:36:06.163
LAURA: Ah, screw that

00:36:06.329 --> 00:36:07.228
MATT: That's okay. What did you roll?

00:36:07.228 --> 00:36:10.168
LAURA: Oh, but I do. Wait. My favored terrain is
the Underdark.

00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:13.507
MATT: Okay. All right. For that, I will go ahead
and give you advantage on that. This is

00:36:13.507 --> 00:36:18.785
technically considered the crust of the Underdark.

00:36:18.785 --> 00:36:21.676
LAURA: That doesn't count if it rolls
onto a phone?

00:36:21.751 --> 00:36:23.297
LIAM: I think that's in this book.

00:36:23.297 --> 00:36:24.488
MATT: Yeah, yeah, I think it's chapter four.

00:36:24.488 --> 00:36:25.716
LAURA: 19 is what I rolled.

00:36:25.716 --> 00:36:30.874
MATT: 19. Okay. As you guys begin to move, you can
find, like, there is this waterfall. Which you can

00:36:30.874 --> 00:36:35.413
hear in the distance, there are a number of
cascading, crashing water sounds. So you imagine

00:36:35.413 --> 00:36:38.348
there are multiple layers as this cavern descends
down into the darkness.

00:36:38.348 --> 00:36:41.437
What are you using for a light source, by the way?

00:36:41.437 --> 00:36:42.436
LIAM: Tiberius, yeah?

00:36:42.436 --> 00:36:43.413
SAM: Tiberius, hit us.

00:36:43.413 --> 00:36:44.179
ORION: What's happening?

00:36:44.179 --> 00:36:44.829
SAM: Light

00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:48.486
TRAVIS: Oh, ah.

00:36:48.486 --> 00:36:50.032
(all laugh)

00:36:50.032 --> 00:36:51.175
MATT: The cavern comes alive with bright white
light.

00:36:51.175 --> 00:36:53.152
TRAVIS: Oh, right. Sunglasses.

00:36:53.152 --> 00:36:58.986
MATT: Using that, you take a while and you begin
to just keep tabs on the surface area of this

00:36:58.986 --> 00:37:02.783
cavern as you begin to move further down. You find
some portions where you can climb down to the lower

00:37:02.783 --> 00:37:08.267
levels. The first thing you notice is there are
definitive signs of struggle or intense running

00:37:08.335 --> 00:37:15.804
towards the direction that you came from. Meaning
things were seemingly either fleeing or heading

00:37:15.804 --> 00:37:22.346
that direction very quickly. Some of them appear
to be more recent than others. You also begin to

00:37:22.346 --> 00:37:35.085
see a few partially decomposed corpses of various
goblinoid creatures. You find two goblins just

00:37:35.085 --> 00:37:40.057
slain, just cut open, and off to the side you see
some of the skin is pulled tight against the bone

00:37:40.057 --> 00:37:45.801
as a lot of it is just rotting from the cave
itself. Not a very great smell. There have been

00:37:45.801 --> 00:37:52.446
small pockets of struggle the more you progress
down this way. You also find some drag marks that

00:37:52.446 --> 00:38:01.564
are similar to what you saw back in the mines, and
as you move forward and the light begins to open

00:38:01.564 --> 00:38:08.174
up, you can see small pockets of that red stone
that's used to light a bunch of Kraghammer. You

00:38:08.174 --> 00:38:12.679
can start seeing elements of it embedded in the
walls of the cavern ahead and just faintly giving

00:38:12.679 --> 00:38:18.334
this reddish glow and the outline of some shapes.
You begin to step into the outskirts about 60 feet

00:38:18.334 --> 00:38:24.534
ahead of what looks like a series of huts, small
stone structures cobbled together with small stone

00:38:24.534 --> 00:38:30.498
and stacked on each other. Simple driftwood and
broken pieces of scavenged material put into small

00:38:30.498 --> 00:38:37.737
buildings. It's a very kinda ramshackle village
underground.

00:38:37.737 --> 00:38:38.910
SAM: Let's burn it down.

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:41.255
LIAM: I am stealthing. I roll stealth.

00:38:41.255 --> 00:38:42.617
LAURA: Oh, okay, I'm gonna stealth too.

00:38:42.617 --> 00:38:43.494
LIAM: Natural 20.

00:38:43.494 --> 00:38:44.398
MARISHA: Woohoo!

00:38:44.398 --> 00:38:50.396
LAURA: Natural 20. Oh, that really didn't count.

00:38:50.396 --> 00:38:53.216
LIAM: Just roll on your phone a couple times and
then off to the side.

00:38:53.216 --> 00:38:54.965
LAURA: They all sucked, so.

00:38:55.019 --> 00:39:00.207
LIAM: And you said that the red crystals on the
wall are glowing somewhat?

00:39:00.262 --> 00:39:04.164
MATT: Yeah, it's a certain amount of crystal that
this mountain range

00:39:04.239 --> 00:39:07.447
seems to naturally produce that just inherently.

00:39:07.447 --> 00:39:12.364
LIAM: Enough to give the half-elves vision in low
light?

00:39:12.364 --> 00:39:18.971
MATT: It seems such. At the point where you're
close to it. Currently you have to use his light

00:39:18.971 --> 00:39:23.802
source to see much of anything. This village
doesn't have any, but near the walls and the edges

00:39:23.802 --> 00:39:28.248
of the cavern you can see the gentle outline of
this whole size of it. It's immense.

00:39:28.248 --> 00:39:30.500
TALIESIN: Does it seem that there are signs of
life?

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.843
MATT: From this view, you don't see any movement.

00:39:32.843 --> 00:39:36.197
LIAM: I am starting to creep along the ground
towards the nearest building and press up against

00:39:36.197 --> 00:39:38.431
the wall and see if I can-- I'm just going to
listen.

00:39:38.431 --> 00:39:42.436
LAURA: I rolled a 16, is that enough to actually
stealth?

00:39:42.436 --> 00:39:43.365
MATT: That's up to you.

00:39:43.365 --> 00:39:44.156
LAURA: No.

00:39:44.156 --> 00:39:45.779
MARISHA: I'm going to let the twins stealth
ahead.

00:39:45.944 --> 00:39:51.436
MATT: You guys stealth ahead. The two of you
follow each other, and you get to the outskirts,

00:39:51.436 --> 00:39:57.129
and you can now see in the center of this, a
number of the buildings and huts have been smashed

00:39:57.129 --> 00:40:03.822
or destroyed. You can see more and more of these
goblin corpses strewn across the ground. You can

00:40:03.822 --> 00:40:08.880
see some of these tents seem to have rags or
something stuffed into one that's not too far

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:16.498
ahead of you. There's two goblins near you,
apparently slashed open. Similar wounds. It's just

00:40:16.498 --> 00:40:19.666
from the first glance stepping forward.

00:40:19.666 --> 00:40:22.328
LIAM: None of them alive, that we can tell?

00:40:22.328 --> 00:40:23.247
MATT: Nope.

00:40:23.247 --> 00:40:25.022
LAURA: We can't see any movement anywhere?

00:40:25.077 --> 00:40:27.194
MATT: Not from this perspective. You guys moved
ahead and you barely have any light source of your

00:40:27.194 --> 00:40:30.400
own. You're having to deal with just the outskirts
of his light spell.

00:40:30.567 --> 00:40:32.312
LAURA: And none of that red light is lighting any
of this?

00:40:32.312 --> 00:40:35.239
MATT: Not in the center of the village. Those are
only towards the outside walls of the cavern.

00:40:35.239 --> 00:40:36.371
LIAM: So we're in the dark.

00:40:36.374 --> 00:40:39.828
LAURA: Can I go up and see if I can get one of
those little red rocks?

00:40:39.828 --> 00:40:43.975
MATT: You can walk off to the side. So you take a
few minutes to walk off to the very edge of the

00:40:43.975 --> 00:40:51.024
cavern. The rock is less of an actual stone that
you can pull, more than it's a cluster of-- almost

00:40:51.143 --> 00:40:55.809
like a vein of the stone in the actual wall. It
would take a while for you to actually hack it out

00:40:55.861 --> 00:40:59.578
of the side. It can be done, but it will take you
a while.

00:40:59.578 --> 00:41:01.552
LAURA: Nah. I don't want to waste the time.

00:41:01.552 --> 00:41:03.153
MATT: Okay.

00:41:03.153 --> 00:41:04.369
LAURA: What do you think, should I do it?

00:41:04.369 --> 00:41:04.936
LIAM: No.

00:41:04.936 --> 00:41:05.702
LAURA: Okay, cool.

00:41:05.702 --> 00:41:08.041
TRAVIS: (laughs) No.

00:41:08.041 --> 00:41:11.464
LIAM: But we're in pitch black here, and we can't
really see what's going on. I think we need--

00:41:11.464 --> 00:41:12.445
LAURA: A lantern.

00:41:12.445 --> 00:41:13.379
LIAM: And Tiberius.

00:41:13.379 --> 00:41:14.749
LAURA: (whispers) Tiberius.

00:41:14.749 --> 00:41:17.294
LIAM: Wait, hold on. Tiberius, will you bring the
party up?

00:41:17.294 --> 00:41:19.376
ORION: Oh yes, of course, we'll be right there.

00:41:19.376 --> 00:41:22.365
LAURA: Does anybody know-- have we told anybody at
home what that actually is?

00:41:22.365 --> 00:41:24.982
MATT: Okay, so as you guys are aware, one of the
magical items that was designed by Tiberius early

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:30.381
in the campaign are essentially these gem
enchanted earrings that activate as a Message

00:41:30.381 --> 00:41:33.648
spell between a few party members. He made a few
of them.

00:41:33.648 --> 00:41:36.418
LIAM: It was five total. Why don't we nail down
who that is. It's the twins.

00:41:36.418 --> 00:41:37.961
LAURA: We both have one.

00:41:38.012 --> 00:41:38.796
LIAM: You.

00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:40.323
ORION: You have one. He has one. She has one.

00:41:40.323 --> 00:41:42.038
LIAM: He's pretty sneaky. All right.

00:41:42.038 --> 00:41:44.319
SAM: And we can send and receive messages or just
receive?

00:41:44.319 --> 00:41:46.544
MATT: You're essentially whispering into each
other's ears.

00:41:46.544 --> 00:41:47.398
ORION: They're like walkie-talkies.

00:41:47.398 --> 00:41:48.486
LAURA: It's like a walkie-talkie.

00:41:48.486 --> 00:41:49.921
MATT: But it only works within a certain range.

00:41:49.921 --> 00:41:51.565
SAM: Is it like a Madonna microphone?

00:41:51.565 --> 00:41:52.890
MATT: A straight up with a big ol'--

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:54.188
ORION: I think it's like 500 feet.

00:41:54.188 --> 00:42:02.422
MATT: 500 feet is the maximum length. So. You guys
approach slowly, the light source opens up, and

00:42:02.422 --> 00:42:10.581
you see now a multitude of goblin bodies strewn
about the open area of this village. You can see

00:42:10.581 --> 00:42:14.230
there are actually piles of corpses stuffed into
some of these huts in the sides that aren't

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:19.159
goblin. You can see what looks like a few small
dwarven bodies piled up on the side. As you kinda

00:42:19.159 --> 00:42:22.258
glance over you look, some of them are partially
eaten like they have been stripped for meat.

00:42:22.258 --> 00:42:23.011
LAURA: Ew.

00:42:23.011 --> 00:42:24.211
TRAVIS: What?

00:42:24.211 --> 00:42:30.637
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:42:30.637 --> 00:42:31.756
LAURA: 24.

00:42:31.756 --> 00:42:32.671
LIAM: 22.

00:42:32.671 --> 00:42:33.843
MATT: Okay.

00:42:33.843 --> 00:42:35.674
LIAM: Check that building?

00:42:35.674 --> 00:42:46.740
MATT: As you look through the building, there are
piles of bone, sinew, and metal at this point. The

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.581
dwarven bodies are mostly decomposed entirely,
what remnants

00:42:49.581 --> 00:42:51.997
have not been stripped off it for food.

00:42:51.997 --> 00:42:55.456
LIAM: Anything useful in the pile?

00:42:55.456 --> 00:43:04.148
MATT: As far as what you guys can tell, you
discover two things. One of the dwarves has a set

00:43:04.148 --> 00:43:05.860
of very very finely crafted leather armor.

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:07.251
LAURA: Ooh.

00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:10.003
MATT: To pull it off the corpse is going to
destroy it and

00:43:10.003 --> 00:43:12.539
going to be a not very interesting affair.

00:43:12.539 --> 00:43:13.440
LAURA: Oh.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:18.655
MATT: But it does look to have survived the
horrible conditions under here. You also note

00:43:18.655 --> 00:43:25.120
specifically, Vex, that not the dwarven corpses,
but a number of the goblin corpses you come

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:30.291
across, some of them have a uniform wound. A
number of these goblin corpses

00:43:30.291 --> 00:43:35.441
have this terrible puncture wound in the skull.

00:43:35.441 --> 00:43:36.435
LAURA: Oh no.

00:43:36.435 --> 00:43:41.840
MATT: In the forehead there. Just an opening wound
about that big around.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.862
LAURA: You didn't notice that, that's how
unperceptive you are.

00:43:44.862 --> 00:43:47.499
LIAM: My sister, everybody.

00:43:47.499 --> 00:43:51.556
MATT: And for each one of these wounds-- for as
much flesh is on these goblins,

00:43:51.556 --> 00:43:54.417
there doesn't appear to be anything inside.

00:43:54.417 --> 00:43:57.994
LAURA: It sucked their brains out. Whatever it
was.

00:43:57.994 --> 00:43:59.461
MATT: It's very possible.

00:43:59.461 --> 00:44:00.686
TRAVIS: I know what that feels like.

00:44:00.686 --> 00:44:01.992
ORION: Ooh, brain suckers.

00:44:01.992 --> 00:44:05.483
TRAVIS: Are we with you?

00:44:05.483 --> 00:44:06.532
LAURA: No, you're not, you're still hanging out--

00:44:06.532 --> 00:44:07.679
SAM: We've come back.

00:44:07.679 --> 00:44:09.102
TRAVIS: Did you put your finger in the hole?

00:44:09.102 --> 00:44:11.639
LAURA: I'm going to put my finger in the hole.

00:44:11.639 --> 00:44:13.578
ORION: I sauntered up 'cause--

00:44:13.578 --> 00:44:14.262
SAM: You sauntered up.

00:44:14.262 --> 00:44:15.252
ORION: You guys are sticking to the darkness?

00:44:15.252 --> 00:44:17.562
MATT: Your finger goes inside, you reach around.
There are elements of brain matter within there

00:44:17.562 --> 00:44:19.994
but even that has become very gelatinous.

00:44:19.994 --> 00:44:21.048
TRAVIS: Oatmeal.

00:44:21.048 --> 00:44:24.689
MATT: Partially decomposed in its own right,
almost like a slime. But sure enough, the inside

00:44:24.689 --> 00:44:27.380
of the cranium itself is mostly vacant.

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.052
LAURA: Lovely. Trinket, no, he's not with us.

00:44:30.052 --> 00:44:31.610
MATT: Trinket is back with the party.

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:33.882
MARISHA: So we can only assume that, what was his
name?

00:44:33.882 --> 00:44:35.678
SAM: Should we rejoin our fellows?

00:44:35.678 --> 00:44:36.298
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:44:36.298 --> 00:44:38.956
LAURA: I guess it seems like it's safe enough,
right? Around here right now?

00:44:38.956 --> 00:44:40.141
TRAVIS: We come running up.

00:44:40.141 --> 00:44:43.099
ORION: We do.

00:44:43.099 --> 00:44:45.010
SAM: Traipsing, we traipse up.

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:45.980
TRAVIS: Skipping.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.413
LAURA: As silently as possible, you come running
up.

00:44:48.413 --> 00:44:50.363
TRAVIS: (sings)

00:44:50.363 --> 00:44:52.200
SAM: What's going on, guys?

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.951
LAURA: Brain suckers, something that sucks
brains.

00:44:54.951 --> 00:44:57.458
SAM: As long as they are sucking it out of
goblins, I'm good with that.

00:44:57.458 --> 00:45:02.098
LIAM: My sister doesn't remember, but one of our
instructors in Syngorn used to tell us of a

00:45:02.098 --> 00:45:04.322
creature, I'm not sure what they're called, but--

00:45:04.322 --> 00:45:05.850
LAURA: I don't think I was in that class,
actually.

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:12.457
LIAM: Mm. A creature that steals its victims'
minds and digests them,

00:45:12.457 --> 00:45:15.746
reaches right in and takes them out.

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:20.689
ORION: I'm assuming it's got to be a much smaller,
mutated version of our brain-on-legs friend.

00:45:20.689 --> 00:45:22.406
LIAM: I think it's much worse.

00:45:22.406 --> 00:45:23.272
MARISHA: Yeah. Much worse.

00:45:23.272 --> 00:45:23.970
LAURA: Much worse?

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:24.763
LIAM: Much worse.

00:45:24.763 --> 00:45:25.479
ORION: Yeah.

00:45:25.479 --> 00:45:28.112
LIAM: I think the brain was a scout or some sort
of pet.

00:45:28.112 --> 00:45:34.397
MARISHA: Well, we also have this K'varn, who is
experimenting on all those creatures,

00:45:34.397 --> 00:45:36.366
so we can't even attest for any of this.

00:45:36.366 --> 00:45:37.147
LAURA: Exactly.

00:45:37.147 --> 00:45:37.856
ORION: That's true.

00:45:37.856 --> 00:45:39.300
TRAVIS: I take a few steps back.

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.333
TALIESIN: It could just be parts of one.

00:45:40.333 --> 00:45:44.527
MARISHA: Yeah, parts of one. It could be a
hodge-podge of everything

00:45:44.527 --> 00:45:46.241
TALIESIN: A dragon, goblin drained, brained--

00:45:46.241 --> 00:45:49.456
LAURA: (gasps) What if K'varn is a dragon? What
if-- oh wait, I don't know anything about that.

00:45:49.456 --> 00:45:51.681
What was that symbol anyway, Tiberius?

00:45:51.681 --> 00:45:53.999
ORION: That was a symbol of Bahamut, and it was a
protection thing

00:45:53.999 --> 00:45:56.403
that I'm sure she put up to protect herself.

00:45:56.403 --> 00:45:58.198
LAURA: Oh. So it was a good symbol?

00:45:58.198 --> 00:45:58.982
ORION: It was, yes.

00:45:58.982 --> 00:45:59.924
LAURA: Okay.

00:45:59.924 --> 00:46:03.194
MATT: You recall that Lady Kima was, specifically,
a paladin of Bahamut.

00:46:03.194 --> 00:46:05.275
LAURA: Oh! So she probably did that.

00:46:05.275 --> 00:46:06.532
MARISHA: So she's been here.

00:46:06.532 --> 00:46:08.857
MATT: That camp seems to have been hers while she
was traipsing through the tunnels.

00:46:08.857 --> 00:46:09.659
LAURA: I understand.

00:46:09.659 --> 00:46:10.383
TALIESIN: Ah!

00:46:10.383 --> 00:46:16.179
LIAM: I just think we should proceed with caution.
Our teachers spoke about this thing, said that it

00:46:16.179 --> 00:46:24.389
was a being of the mind. I think our trouble with
Grog could just be the beginning. We need to

00:46:24.389 --> 00:46:26.386
proceed very carefully.

00:46:26.386 --> 00:46:27.339
LAURA: Oh no!

00:46:27.339 --> 00:46:33.809
TRAVIS: I have two potions of fox's cunning. Could
I drink one of those, since there's a giant

00:46:33.809 --> 00:46:35.713
brain-bitch wondering around the camp?

00:46:35.713 --> 00:46:36.832
MARISHA: That's for your wisdom.

00:46:36.832 --> 00:46:37.845
SAM: How long do they last?

00:46:37.845 --> 00:46:38.992
LAURA: You could make yourself smarter?

00:46:38.992 --> 00:46:40.017
TRAVIS: But it don't last very long.

00:46:40.017 --> 00:46:42.313
MATT: Fox's cunning would give you benefit, I
believe, to--

00:46:42.313 --> 00:46:44.634
MARISHA: Intelligence.

00:46:44.634 --> 00:46:45.629
MATT: I mean, essentially--

00:46:45.629 --> 00:46:47.139
MARISHA: It would be Enhance Ability, essentially.

00:46:47.139 --> 00:46:49.541
MATT: It would be Enhance Ability for wisdom, I'm
pretty sure.

00:46:49.541 --> 00:46:52.345
MARISHA: I'll tell you. I think it's wisdom.

00:46:52.345 --> 00:46:53.313
TRAVIS: Not intelligence?

00:46:53.313 --> 00:46:54.495
MARISHA: No, no, no, it's intelligence.

00:46:54.495 --> 00:46:55.553
MATT: It's intelligence? Okay, there you go.

00:46:55.553 --> 00:46:57.489
MARISHA: Because I think it's like owl's wisdom
for wisdom.

00:46:57.489 --> 00:46:58.713
MATT: Right, no, you're correct. So essentially it
would be an

00:46:58.713 --> 00:47:00.521
Enhance Ability for intelligence, yes.

00:47:00.521 --> 00:47:01.901
LAURA: How long does it last?

00:47:01.901 --> 00:47:06.958
MATT: Oh, for the potion's effect? That would be
anywhere from four to eight hours,

00:47:06.958 --> 00:47:07.972
you're not quite sure.

00:47:07.972 --> 00:47:09.766
LAURA: Maybe you should wait until we come across
something.

00:47:09.766 --> 00:47:10.931
TRAVIS: All right, but if it's too late--

00:47:10.931 --> 00:47:13.464
MARISHA: Yeah, you have advantage on intelligence
checks.

00:47:13.464 --> 00:47:15.316
TRAVIS: Intelligence checks? All right.

00:47:15.316 --> 00:47:16.519
LIAM: Just don't go running off into the dark
again.

00:47:16.519 --> 00:47:19.480
LAURA: Yeah, let us lead the way, or whoever's
smart. I'm really smart, how smart are you?

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:20.964
LIAM: Not smart enough, apparently.

00:47:20.964 --> 00:47:22.417
MARISHA: So it wouldn't necessarily--

00:47:22.417 --> 00:47:23.441
TRAVIS: It wouldn't make my intelligence higher?

00:47:23.441 --> 00:47:24.710
MARISHA: It wouldn't make your intelligence
higher,

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:25.701
and it wouldn't necessarily help with your 
vulnerability.

00:47:25.701 --> 00:47:26.842
TRAVIS: All right, never mind.

00:47:26.842 --> 00:47:27.645
LIAM: He's smart.

00:47:27.645 --> 00:47:29.553
LAURA: Who's our smartest person? Who has the
highest intelligence here?

00:47:29.553 --> 00:47:32.485
LIAM: What are these scores you keep talking
about? I don't know what anybody's talking about.

00:47:32.485 --> 00:47:35.913
ORION: It's okay, Vax. I don't know what a lot of
people are talking about all of the time.

00:47:35.913 --> 00:47:36.885
TALIESIN: IRL?

00:47:36.885 --> 00:47:38.437
TRAVIS: Yeah, whoever's the smartest should be in
the front.

00:47:38.437 --> 00:47:39.296
LAURA: That's true.

00:47:39.296 --> 00:47:40.374
TALIESIN: I'm sitting at 16.

00:47:40.374 --> 00:47:41.414
TRAVIS: 14.

00:47:41.414 --> 00:47:42.180
LIAM: 16.

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:43.028
LAURA: 16.

00:47:43.028 --> 00:47:45.190
MARISHA: Well it's about, like, having high-- it's
not necessarily being smart,

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:47.773
it's about having resistance to willpower.

00:47:47.773 --> 00:47:50.207
LAURA: But if they take you down-- if they take
down your intelligence,

00:47:50.207 --> 00:47:53.146
then whoever has higher intelligence--

00:47:53.146 --> 00:47:54.114
MARISHA: Right.

00:47:54.114 --> 00:47:55.958
SAM: No one's going to take down our intelligence,
we're too strong and we're too awesome.

00:47:55.958 --> 00:47:57.749
LAURA: I don't want another catatonic-- all
right.

00:47:57.749 --> 00:47:59.127
ORION: And we know what we're going into.

00:47:59.127 --> 00:48:00.080
LAURA: All right!

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.209
MARISHA: Well, we sort of know what we're going
into.

00:48:01.209 --> 00:48:02.656
TRAVIS: Does that mean we get to run into a
fight?

00:48:02.656 --> 00:48:04.125
LAURA: Oh no, this music sounds very fighty.

00:48:04.125 --> 00:48:05.054
MARISHA: Hang on.

00:48:05.054 --> 00:48:06.369
SAM: Or festive.

00:48:06.369 --> 00:48:07.475
LAURA: Oh no!

00:48:07.475 --> 00:48:09.213
MARISHA: Okay, so here's my question.

00:48:09.213 --> 00:48:09.945
LIAM: Yeah.

00:48:09.945 --> 00:48:11.875
MARISHA: So we've already fought two things where
we can't look at them

00:48:11.875 --> 00:48:14.991
and they mess with our heads.

00:48:14.991 --> 00:48:15.648
TRAVIS: Right.

00:48:15.648 --> 00:48:16.381
LAURA: Yes.

00:48:16.381 --> 00:48:18.552
MARISHA: So is there something we can do going
forward--

00:48:18.552 --> 00:48:21.481
LAURA: To like boost our willpower or something?

00:48:21.481 --> 00:48:22.513
MARISHA: Or like--

00:48:22.513 --> 00:48:27.890
TALIESIN: You want Magneto's helmet? What you want
is Magneto's helmet.

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:29.617
MARISHA: I like Magneto's helmet! Or even if we--

00:48:29.617 --> 00:48:31.115
TALIESIN: I haven't built Magneto's helmet.

00:48:31.115 --> 00:48:34.323
MARISHA: Do we have a bunch of mirrors? Or where
we can look through things with reflections.

00:48:34.323 --> 00:48:36.169
LAURA: (gasps) I gave you some mirrors! Do you
remember?

00:48:36.169 --> 00:48:37.239
LIAM: I have mirrors.

00:48:37.239 --> 00:48:38.213
TRAVIS: We do have a big dressing mirror.

00:48:38.213 --> 00:48:39.313
LIAM: But that's more for--

00:48:39.313 --> 00:48:41.486
LAURA: For looking around corners?

00:48:41.486 --> 00:48:42.439
LIAM: I don't know if that's going to help.

00:48:42.439 --> 00:48:43.296
LAURA: It could help!

00:48:43.296 --> 00:48:44.280
ORION: I could make a mirror.

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.663
LIAM: Yes, I have them, of course. I always, I
always have them, they were a gift.

00:48:45.663 --> 00:48:47.283
TRAVIS: We have one mirror in the bag of holding.

00:48:47.283 --> 00:48:48.206
LAURA: That's good!

00:48:48.206 --> 00:48:49.321
ORION: With like an ice-type of thing--

00:48:49.321 --> 00:48:50.255
LAURA: We could put a mirror--

00:48:50.255 --> 00:48:52.075
MARISHA: Kind of like a Medusa's gaze thing. You
know, where you like look in the reflection.

00:48:52.075 --> 00:48:54.882
LIAM: But that's a Gorgon. That's talking about
the gaze--

00:48:54.882 --> 00:48:55.745
MARISHA: Right.

00:48:55.745 --> 00:48:57.191
LIAM: We're talking about the mind, I think.

00:48:57.191 --> 00:48:57.911
LAURA: Right.

00:48:57.911 --> 00:48:58.909
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:48:58.909 --> 00:49:02.255
SAM: I have a whip! And a forgery kit.

00:49:02.255 --> 00:49:04.045
(all laugh)

00:49:04.045 --> 00:49:06.987
MARISHA: It would just be about making us less
vulnerable to the mind--

00:49:06.987 --> 00:49:09.211
LIAM: Could you forge some professor hats for us
all?

00:49:09.211 --> 00:49:11.138
(all laugh)

00:49:11.138 --> 00:49:13.158
LAURA: So what, our option is to keep moving
forward, then?

00:49:13.158 --> 00:49:15.366
SAM: Yes, just be cautious, that's all we can do.

00:49:15.366 --> 00:49:16.629
VAX and TALIESIN: That's all we can do.

00:49:16.629 --> 00:49:17.406
LAURA: All right.

00:49:17.406 --> 00:49:18.303
TRAVIS: We move forward.

00:49:18.303 --> 00:49:19.243
SAM: What do you want to do, you want go back?

00:49:19.243 --> 00:49:20.610
LAURA: As quietly as possible, to keep moving
forward.

00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:21.940
TALIESIN: It's difficult to prepare for what we're
not prepared for.

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:23.940
LAURA: And on the lookout for anything in this
ramshackle town.

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:25.320
MARISHA: That's true.

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.133
TALIESIN: Sorry.

00:49:26.133 --> 00:49:28.651
MARISHA: I mean, I can cast Enhance Ability to
help our willpower? Or our will.

00:49:28.651 --> 00:49:30.290
MATT: So you leave behind the pile of dwarven
corpses, you leave behind the goblin corpses with

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:33.145
the wounds and start seeing more of a pattern.

00:49:33.145 --> 00:49:40.262
LIAM: And if I may, I suggest Tiberius, you work
your Light spell, and Vex'ahlia and I scout ahead

00:49:40.262 --> 00:49:45.159
about 60 or 70 feet, so that we can see in the dim
light, catch anything coming, using your magic.

00:49:45.159 --> 00:49:46.471
LAURA: Yes.

00:49:46.471 --> 00:49:50.004
TRAVIS: And I light up the hooded lantern we have
in the bag of holding.

00:49:50.004 --> 00:49:54.051
MATT: Okay. So you put the hood on and light that
up, very good. Leaving the leather armor behind?

00:49:54.051 --> 00:49:56.912
LAURA: Oh well, I thought you said it would get
ruined if we took it?

00:49:56.912 --> 00:49:58.184
LIAM: And it was dwarf-sized.

00:49:58.184 --> 00:49:59.743
MATT: No, it would be nasty pulling it off a
corpse.

00:49:59.743 --> 00:50:00.922
LAURA: Oh, well then, fuck it, let's pull it off.

00:50:00.977 --> 00:50:02.979
LIAM: Isn't it dwarf-sized? Or is armor also
shrink and expand?

00:50:02.979 --> 00:50:04.314
LAURA: It's magical. Possibly.

00:50:04.314 --> 00:50:05.350
MATT: It's dwarf-sized.

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:06.145
LIAM: Magical.

00:50:06.145 --> 00:50:08.044
ORION: It's fine. I cast Prestidigitation and
clean it all up.

00:50:08.044 --> 00:50:08.956
LAURA: I take it.

00:50:08.956 --> 00:50:10.196
MATT: Okay, so you shake off the element--

00:50:10.196 --> 00:50:11.320
LAURA: All the goo.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:15.093
MATT: -- the remaining elements of the dwarven
corpse. Just falls off out of the armor. You have

00:50:15.093 --> 00:50:16.926
to kind of shake it and eventually all of it
escapes--

00:50:16.926 --> 00:50:18.572
LAURA: Yes. Thank you!

00:50:18.572 --> 00:50:19.575
TALIESIN: Dwarven corpse.

00:50:19.575 --> 00:50:21.180
LIAM: It's like pulled pork.

00:50:21.298 --> 00:50:22.565
LAURA: Mm.

00:50:22.565 --> 00:50:24.174
MATT: Make an arcana check. It does have a magical
aura.

00:50:24.174 --> 00:50:25.803
LAURA: (gasps) What is it?

00:50:25.803 --> 00:50:27.407
ORION: Nice. 20.

00:50:27.407 --> 00:50:33.431
MATT: All right. It appears to be a simple but
powerful enchantment. It is a pair of studded

00:50:33.431 --> 00:50:35.833
leather armor with a +2 enchantment.

00:50:35.833 --> 00:50:36.868
LAURA: +2 enchantment to what?

00:50:36.868 --> 00:50:37.941
SAM: +2 enchantment?

00:50:37.941 --> 00:50:39.182
MATT: To your AC.

00:50:39.182 --> 00:50:41.932
LIAM: If I try to pull on the sleeve, does it come
up to my elbow or does it stretch out and fit?

00:50:41.932 --> 00:50:45.104
MATT: It comes up to your elbow and then, given a
moment, it fits to your form.

00:50:45.104 --> 00:50:46.207
LAURA: Ooh, yeah!

00:50:46.207 --> 00:50:47.400
LIAM: That's nice.

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.126
LAURA: Go take that studded leather armor,
brother!

00:50:49.126 --> 00:50:54.416
LIAM: I'll take this, hold on. Thank you. I go
into the smelly corpse hut

00:50:54.416 --> 00:50:56.306
and start to change my armor.

00:50:56.306 --> 00:50:57.376
LAURA: What did you get? Let me see that.

00:50:57.376 --> 00:50:58.727
SAM: So wait, does he get a bigger or higher AC?
What is that?

00:50:58.727 --> 00:51:01.133
MATT: Yes, it is considered-- it works as studded
leather armor, but that gives him a +2 bonus to

00:51:01.133 --> 00:51:02.662
his armor class on top of that.

00:51:02.662 --> 00:51:04.651
SAM: Wow, that's huge!

00:51:04.651 --> 00:51:06.252
LAURA: Yeah, so he just took it.

00:51:06.252 --> 00:51:07.095
SAM: I'll take it.

00:51:07.095 --> 00:51:08.018
LAURA: He already took it.

00:51:08.018 --> 00:51:09.483
MARISHA: Hey, dungeon master? Asking as the
dungeon master.

00:51:09.483 --> 00:51:10.379
MATT: Yes?

00:51:10.379 --> 00:51:13.652
MARISHA: If I cast Owl's Wisdom on people, it
gives people advantage on wisdom checks. Would

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:15.772
that count on saving throws against willpower?

00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:16.584
MATT: No.

00:51:16.584 --> 00:51:19.151
LAURA: Damn it!

00:51:19.151 --> 00:51:20.924
MATT: Not checks, specifically.

00:51:21.038 --> 00:51:22.285
MARISHA: Would it help anything?

00:51:22.285 --> 00:51:23.080
MATT: I mean--

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.472
MARISHA: Would, would any advantage to wisdom
under Enhance Ability help some?

00:51:25.472 --> 00:51:26.624
MATT: Let me double-check it.

00:51:26.624 --> 00:51:27.843
SAM: I'll give you all dice before we go in.

00:51:27.843 --> 00:51:32.233
LAURA: Some of these-- I remember we rolled
charisma saving throws, though, for the umbers.

00:51:32.233 --> 00:51:34.348
They were charisma.

00:51:34.348 --> 00:51:37.372
MARISHA: Right. And for the brains it was versus
willpower.

00:51:37.372 --> 00:51:41.234
SAM: While the DM looks this up, everyone,
subscribe to the Geek and Sundry twitch channel!

00:51:41.234 --> 00:51:45.107
Support the show, support the channel.

00:51:45.107 --> 00:51:48.529
MARISHA: Yeah! And don't forget about our charity,
826LA, which

00:51:48.529 --> 00:51:52.036
helps children be literate and write stories well.

00:51:52.036 --> 00:51:54.311
ORION: It makes them smarter in the head.

00:51:54.311 --> 00:51:56.103
SAM: And keep sending us food.

00:51:56.103 --> 00:51:57.616
(all laugh)

00:51:57.616 --> 00:51:58.415
TRAVIS: We like food.

00:51:58.415 --> 00:51:59.484
SAM: And more presents.

00:51:59.484 --> 00:52:01.182
LIAM: If you want a thousand years--

00:52:01.182 --> 00:52:03.698
ZAC: There's more food on the way, so don't ask
them for more.

00:52:03.698 --> 00:52:04.304
MARISHA: What?

00:52:04.304 --> 00:52:05.017
ORION: Oh, no!

00:52:05.017 --> 00:52:05.798
TRAVIS: No food!

00:52:05.798 --> 00:52:06.807
TALIESIN and SAM: No more food.

00:52:06.807 --> 00:52:08.511
MATT: Yeah, we have enough food, guys,
thank you.

00:52:08.511 --> 00:52:12.790
LIAM: If you want a thousand years of D&amp;amp;D, we've
got to pay the overheads, so please, subscribe!

00:52:12.854 --> 00:52:14.187
ORION: It's true!

00:52:14.187 --> 00:52:18.030
MATT: So yeah, unfortunately it helps ability
checks, those are not considered saving throws.

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:20.316
LAURA: All right.

00:52:20.316 --> 00:52:21.480
MARISHA: I don't know if I have anything.

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.558
TALIESIN: We'll be all right, we'll be all right.

00:52:22.558 --> 00:52:23.748
ORION: As we start to walk, I cast Stoneskin on
myself.

00:52:23.748 --> 00:52:25.737
MATT: You cast Stoneskin on yourself? All right,
Stoneskin's on you, Tiberius.

00:52:25.737 --> 00:52:26.910
LIAM: Once you've got the dwarf gunk off, it's
rather nice.

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:27.694
LAURA: Oh yeah?

00:52:27.694 --> 00:52:28.689
LIAM: Yes, it's supple.

00:52:28.689 --> 00:52:31.678
SAM: All right, shall we keep on keeping on?

00:52:31.678 --> 00:52:32.309
TALIESIN: Let's go.

00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:33.972
LAURA: Let's go, let's keep on moving!

00:52:33.972 --> 00:52:34.902
MARISHA: Let's get it done.

00:52:34.902 --> 00:52:36.241
ORION: (sings) Keep on keeping on.

00:52:36.241 --> 00:52:37.651
MATT: You guys keep pushing forward.

00:52:37.651 --> 00:52:39.454
ORION: Is that what we're going to do?

00:52:39.454 --> 00:52:40.856
LAURA: All right.

00:52:40.856 --> 00:52:43.222
MATT: All right, as you begin to press through the
goblin ghost town--

00:52:43.222 --> 00:52:45.005
TRAVIS: We've got to get it closer than that.

00:52:45.005 --> 00:52:48.175
LAURA: I'm still tracking, looking for anything
interesting.

00:52:48.175 --> 00:52:53.463
MATT: Which you do, you catch, off in the
distance, another faint moving light source.

00:52:53.463 --> 00:52:55.603
LAURA: Oh shit! Hey, everybody, calm down.

00:52:55.603 --> 00:52:56.535
SAM: Huh?

00:52:56.535 --> 00:52:59.171
LAURA: Sh! There's something moving in the
distance.

00:52:59.171 --> 00:53:01.228
MATT: Everyone roll a stealth check.

00:53:01.228 --> 00:53:02.561
TRAVIS: Stealth check?

00:53:02.561 --> 00:53:04.442
MATT: Yes.

00:53:04.442 --> 00:53:08.990
LAURA: Oh god, roll a stealth check. (gasps)
Natural 20!

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:10.477
MATT and LIAM: Nice!

00:53:10.477 --> 00:53:11.742
LIAM: 30.

00:53:11.742 --> 00:53:13.181
MARISHA: 15.

00:53:13.181 --> 00:53:14.104
ORION: 11.

00:53:14.104 --> 00:53:15.124
SAM: 20.

00:53:15.124 --> 00:53:16.535
TALIESIN: 12.

00:53:16.535 --> 00:53:17.720
TRAVIS: (softly) Six.

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.439
MATT: Okay, as you all buckle down and be as quiet
as you can--

00:53:20.439 --> 00:53:22.285
LAURA: You rolled a six? He rolled a six.

00:53:22.285 --> 00:53:23.305
MATT: You begin to see--

00:53:23.305 --> 00:53:25.090
SAM: (whispers) Grog rolled a six.

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:26.332
LIAM: (whispers) Stay put, you asshole.

00:53:26.332 --> 00:53:29.660
MATT: No, noted, that's okay, that's okay. It's a
group check,

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:32.035
in which case people offset each other's 
difficulty.

00:53:32.035 --> 00:53:33.320
TRAVIS: Yay, bell curve.

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:39.334
MATT: So you seem to be comfortable in the
stillness of the moment. Best you can see in the

00:53:39.334 --> 00:53:42.532
distance, you see figures shifting, moving away
from you.

00:53:42.532 --> 00:53:44.069
LAURA: (whispers) Sh, figures!

00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:50.577
MATT: Many figures. A fairly large group of
seeming to be humanoid figures, moving steadily

00:53:50.577 --> 00:53:53.512
away from you.

00:53:53.512 --> 00:53:55.215
LAURA: Can we scout ahead? We're both really super
stealth, can we like--

00:53:55.215 --> 00:53:56.996
LIAM: Yeah, we're gonna start kinda quickly dash
after them.

00:53:56.996 --> 00:53:58.949
MATT: Yeah, using your same stealth rolls, you
push forward.

00:53:58.949 --> 00:54:00.377
TRAVIS: Humanoid figures, you say?

00:54:00.377 --> 00:54:01.396
LIAM: Could mean anything.

00:54:01.396 --> 00:54:05.106
MATT: Yes, best you could tell. As you guys start
reaching the outskirts of the opposite side of

00:54:05.106 --> 00:54:12.554
this small, goblin village that has been
completely sundered, you see a cliff, but a large

00:54:12.554 --> 00:54:18.524
cliff. The actual surface here comes to a very
direct end and seems to just disappear into a dark

00:54:18.524 --> 00:54:25.060
abyss. There is a singular, ten-foot-wide rope
bridge, that is bolted into the side of this cliff

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:31.127
and stretches out across this giant crevasse, for
what-- you can't see the other side.

00:54:31.127 --> 00:54:32.230
TRAVIS: Awesome!

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:34.030
LAURA: This feels like The Descent, I don't like
this, you guys.

00:54:34.097 --> 00:54:37.384
MATT: It very much has that kind of a feel. It
just goes on a for a good 60, 70 feet, and then

00:54:37.384 --> 00:54:43.230
darkness. And you can see what looks to be a
cluster of about 12 to 13 duergar--

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:44.186
LAURA: (whispers) Oh no.

00:54:44.186 --> 00:54:49.174
MATT: -- making their way in lines of two across
this bridge. Amongst them, they have, chained up,

00:54:49.174 --> 00:54:53.685
three dwarf miners that they are also dragging
across the bridge.

00:54:53.685 --> 00:54:54.914
SAM: We have to save those ones.

00:54:54.914 --> 00:54:55.974
TRAVIS: Just cut the bridge

00:54:55.974 --> 00:54:57.104
SAM: No, no!

00:54:57.104 --> 00:55:01.077
LAURA: What do the miners look like? Are they--
are they docile, or are they--

00:55:01.077 --> 00:55:02.751
do they seem to be fighting back?

00:55:02.751 --> 00:55:05.757
MATT: They don't appear to put up much of a fight
in their current circumstance.

00:55:05.757 --> 00:55:06.798
LIAM: How wide is the bridge?

00:55:06.798 --> 00:55:07.493
MATT: Ten feet.

00:55:07.493 --> 00:55:11.385
LIAM: Ten feet? That means two people wide.

00:55:11.385 --> 00:55:13.531
LAURA: Grog goes by himself. Yes.

00:55:13.531 --> 00:55:15.992
LIAM: But if we go out there, it's going to be
close combat.

00:55:15.992 --> 00:55:17.337
TRAVIS: (whispers) We have a flying carpet.

00:55:17.337 --> 00:55:18.830
LIAM: You can't get to the ones at the back.

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:20.486
LAURA: I mean how many are there? Like ten or so?

00:55:20.486 --> 00:55:22.080
LIAM: 12. 12 I count.

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.742
MATT: From what you can see it looks about 12-ish

00:55:24.742 --> 00:55:26.876
LAURA: And they have a light source with them so
we can definitely see them?

00:55:26.876 --> 00:55:31.347
MATT: They do, it's a very faint light. It's like
a small cluster of the red stone that's been mined

00:55:31.347 --> 00:55:35.254
and put into a spherical element and is hanging
from a chain like a lantern.

00:55:35.254 --> 00:55:37.673
LAURA: We have two options. We can fight them.

00:55:37.673 --> 00:55:39.151
LIAM: We could fight now.

00:55:39.151 --> 00:55:40.103
LAURA: Or follow them.

00:55:40.103 --> 00:55:41.229
TRAVIS: Follow.

00:55:41.229 --> 00:55:42.470
LAURA: I think we follow them.

00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:46.494
MARISHA: Do I see any-- are there any bats?

00:55:46.561 --> 00:55:49.986
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:55:49.986 --> 00:55:52.092
SAM: If we follow them on the bridge, won't they
feel it bouncing?

00:55:52.149 --> 00:55:53.200
MARISHA: I failed.

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.559
LAURA: We gotta wait 'til they cross it, Scanlan.

00:55:54.559 --> 00:55:55.846
SAM: We can't see the end of it.

00:55:55.846 --> 00:55:59.124
LIAM: I grab my ear and, Keyleth, I heard you
through Tiberius' earring,

00:55:59.124 --> 00:56:01.818
why don't you just become a bat and follow along?

00:56:01.818 --> 00:56:02.875
LAURA: She's trying to do that.

00:56:02.875 --> 00:56:04.726
MARISHA: I was gonna see if they're in the--

00:56:04.726 --> 00:56:06.681
LIAM: You've never seen a bat in the woods?

00:56:06.681 --> 00:56:10.399
MATT: Best you can tell, and from your knowledge
of bats and their existence, they generally live

00:56:10.469 --> 00:56:14.806
in caverns that have readily available openings to
the outside world, where they do their nocturnal

00:56:14.806 --> 00:56:21.622
hunting. This is a very, very deep cavern that
does not have easy access to the surface. Bats are

00:56:21.683 --> 00:56:23.724
probably not a good chance in this cavern.

00:56:23.724 --> 00:56:31.398
LAURA: I've got an idea. I run back to Grog,
stealthed. I get our flying carpet.

00:56:31.398 --> 00:56:33.622
MATT: A hand suddenly mysteriously reaches into
the bag.

00:56:33.622 --> 00:56:34.549
TRAVIS: (sputters)

00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:37.830
LAURA: Gimme the carpet.

00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:38.434
TRAVIS: What?

00:56:38.434 --> 00:56:39.380
LAURA: The carpet. Gimme the carpet.

00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:40.740
SAM: Just you? You're gonna go on the carpet
alone?

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:42.565
LAURA: And him. we can both go on the carpet.

00:56:42.565 --> 00:56:43.995
SAM: What if something happens?

00:56:43.995 --> 00:56:45.924
LAURA: We just gotta see where they're going!
We'll come back and get you.

00:56:45.924 --> 00:56:47.507
SAM: I'm coming with you.

00:56:47.507 --> 00:56:48.265
LAURA: All right, Scanlan.

00:56:48.265 --> 00:56:53.144
TRAVIS: I give them her carpet, but I also tie the
endless rope thread around.

00:56:53.144 --> 00:56:55.849
LAURA: Oh yeah. Okay, so we have an endless rope
with us.

00:56:55.849 --> 00:56:57.047
LIAM: Now we're a kite.

00:56:57.047 --> 00:57:00.747
MATT: You pull out the carpet and lay it out. At
this point in time,

00:57:00.747 --> 00:57:02.659
they're a little over halfway across the bridge.

00:57:02.659 --> 00:57:03.539
LAURA: Okay, so we--

00:57:03.539 --> 00:57:06.630
MATT: Which, you can see it swaying in a very
uncomfortable way.

00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:08.318
LAURA: Scanlan, you better be stealthed.

00:57:08.318 --> 00:57:09.638
MATT: You hear the stretching of ropes.

00:57:09.638 --> 00:57:13.144
LAURA: Oh, you can hear the rope?

00:57:13.144 --> 00:57:18.049
MATT: As you hear the rope just tense as the
bridge is slowly swaying. So you guys lay out the

00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:19.613
carpet. The two of you get on?

00:57:19.613 --> 00:57:21.048
LAURA and LIAM: And Scanlan.

00:57:21.048 --> 00:57:22.713
LIAM: I grab Scanlan by the scruff of his neck.

00:57:22.713 --> 00:57:24.710
MATT: The three of you guys hop on, and it's
probably big enough for the three of you.

00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:26.275
It's about the right size.

00:57:26.275 --> 00:57:28.070
SAM: Shotgun.

00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:33.860
MATT: The carpet begins to lift off, and you kind
of will it towards-- Are you going straight over

00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:35.291
the bridge or are you taking a side route?

00:57:35.291 --> 00:57:36.712
LAURA: We're going next to the bridge.

00:57:36.712 --> 00:57:38.338
LIAM: Side and up. 'Cause they can look sideways.

00:57:38.338 --> 00:57:39.659
LAURA: I think we should go down below the
bridge.

00:57:39.659 --> 00:57:42.276
LIAM: If you're on a bridge, you're looking down
at your feet.

00:57:42.276 --> 00:57:43.587
SAM: Let's go above them.

00:57:43.666 --> 00:57:45.668
LAURA: All right, fine, fuck it, go above them.

00:57:45.668 --> 00:57:50.512
MATT: Okay so you guys, you take up over. First
off, the three of you guys make a stealth check.

00:57:50.512 --> 00:57:52.052
LAURA: I thought we were still stealthed?

00:57:52.052 --> 00:57:56.007
MATT: Maneuvering on a flying carpet is a
different type of locomotion.

00:57:56.007 --> 00:57:58.894
TALIESIN: We have a flying carpet, by the way.
That's a thing.

00:57:58.894 --> 00:58:00.711
SAM: Not great. 13.

00:58:00.711 --> 00:58:01.513
LIAM: 29.

00:58:01.513 --> 00:58:02.520
LAURA: 17.

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:03.212
MATT: Okay.

00:58:03.212 --> 00:58:05.269
MARISHA: Were you guys trying to stealth? Is that
what happened?

00:58:05.269 --> 00:58:15.718
MATT: So, as soon as you reach the edge of the
crevasse, immediately the air itself is warmer. And

00:58:15.718 --> 00:58:21.833
there's actually a bit of a strange breeze blowing up
from underneath this giant crevasse. And you look

00:58:22.005 --> 00:58:27.691
down and you can see, faintly, light sources.
Long, thin, trickling

00:58:27.691 --> 00:58:31.381
streams of what looks like molten rock.

00:58:31.381 --> 00:58:32.204
TRAVIS: Shit.

00:58:32.204 --> 00:58:33.258
SAM: Way down below.

00:58:33.258 --> 00:58:34.160
MATT: Way down below.

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.072
TRAVIS: That's a ways.

00:58:35.072 --> 00:58:38.331
MATT: It's at least a thousand feet down.

00:58:38.331 --> 00:58:40.741
SAM: We don't want to fall.

00:58:40.741 --> 00:58:45.185
MATT: Don't fall, it's very bad. The air itself
has a very sulfurous smell. There's a lot of

00:58:45.185 --> 00:58:51.537
various strange chemical scents that's a bit
pungent to the nose. There's a lot of chemical

00:58:51.537 --> 00:58:57.137
reactions that are causing this atmosphere. It's a
little difficult to take any air at first. You

00:58:57.137 --> 00:59:01.951
have to get adjusted. It is a very, very deep
cavern below. When you look behind, you can see

00:59:01.951 --> 00:59:07.222
the river that's been cascading through this
cavern goes rocketing off the edge and disappears

00:59:07.222 --> 00:59:13.192
into the darkness below. Are you keeping your
distance or--

00:59:13.192 --> 00:59:14.434
LAURA: Keeping a good distance.

00:59:14.434 --> 00:59:16.857
LIAM: Distance, because they have a light source,
so we want to follow that.

00:59:16.857 --> 00:59:18.994
LAURA: Yeah, so we need to stay kind of out of it
but see it.

00:59:18.994 --> 00:59:27.262
MATT: Okay. You guys push forward, keeping at a
safe distance. You eventually follow them across

00:59:27.262 --> 00:59:34.825
the crevasse, and you can see now them entering
what looks like a shanty town of tents and small

00:59:34.825 --> 00:59:42.636
stone structures. Better built than the goblin
village that was previously there, but it looks

00:59:42.636 --> 00:59:50.659
almost like a temporary or pseudo-temporary series
of homes for the duergar in this section. There's

00:59:50.659 --> 00:59:55.738
a bunch of military tents and cloth pup tents put
up in sections. You can see some easy-to-construct

00:59:55.738 --> 01:00:01.792
one- or two-day constructions of stone buildings.
Very square, very rigid and dwarven in their

01:00:01.792 --> 01:00:09.512
design, more for utility that any sort of visual
presentation or beauty.

01:00:09.512 --> 01:00:11.796
LIAM: This is a temporary war camp.

01:00:11.796 --> 01:00:13.193
LAURA: It is.

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:15.014
MATT: There are also a series of these-

01:00:15.014 --> 01:00:16.114
LIAM: Yes!

01:00:16.114 --> 01:00:17.097
MATT: -- of these redstone--

01:00:17.097 --> 01:00:18.437
LAURA: Good dialogue!

01:00:18.437 --> 01:00:23.983
MATT: Yeah, it's legit guys. A series of these
redstone torches that they were holding, or these

01:00:23.983 --> 01:00:29.188
lanterns, are hung up all throughout the village
on these giant poles that have been placed in

01:00:29.188 --> 01:00:33.958
areas to give a little bit of an occasional light
source throughout this entire camp.

01:00:33.958 --> 01:00:37.466
LAURA: About how many people does it look like-- I
mean, how big is this camp?

01:00:37.466 --> 01:00:38.399
MATT: How big, the camp?

01:00:38.399 --> 01:00:39.421
LIAM: How many buildings?

01:00:39.421 --> 01:00:42.558
MATT: At a first glance, you can only check out
elements of it from your distance, you're only

01:00:42.558 --> 01:00:48.050
making out shapes from how far back you guys are
without actually getting inside. You gather you've

01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:53.744
probably seen throughout, just this portion that
you've come into, anywhere from 30 to 40 duergar

01:00:53.744 --> 01:00:56.442
moving through, as well as a few larger shapes.

01:00:56.442 --> 01:00:57.419
LAURA: (whispers) Oh, shit.

01:00:57.419 --> 01:01:01.822
MATT: You swear you catch one or two other very
large humanoid hulking figures just

01:01:01.822 --> 01:01:02.940
(thudding noises)

01:01:03.045 --> 01:01:04.083
LAURA: Oh no.

01:01:04.083 --> 01:01:05.602
MATT: Stepping through the camp.

01:01:05.602 --> 01:01:06.729
LIAM: How are we gonna get through this?

01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:08.482
LAURA: How are we-- what are we gonna do? What are
we gonna do?

01:01:08.482 --> 01:01:10.012
SAM: The view up here is beautiful!

01:01:10.012 --> 01:01:11.459
LAURA: (sings) A whole new world.

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:13.161
MARISHA: (whispers) Hey, hey, what do you guys
see?

01:01:13.161 --> 01:01:14.264
ORION: Scanlan, what's going on?

01:01:14.264 --> 01:01:15.320
LAURA: (whispers) Okay, so--

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.315
SAM: Is the range? How are--

01:01:16.315 --> 01:01:17.654
MATT: The range is getting a little broken, you
can hear--

01:01:17.654 --> 01:01:18.458
LAURA: Okay.

01:01:18.458 --> 01:01:19.638
MATT: The words are coming through but--

01:01:19.638 --> 01:01:21.159
MARISHA: You're cutting out. I can't hear you

01:01:21.159 --> 01:01:22.024
LAURA: Okay.

01:01:22.024 --> 01:01:22.729
LIAM: I think--

01:01:22.729 --> 01:01:23.677
LAURA: Well, one of us.

01:01:23.677 --> 01:01:24.869
SAM: We'll update you soon.

01:01:24.869 --> 01:01:26.012
LAURA: Well, one of us. Let's put down.

01:01:26.012 --> 01:01:26.807
LIAM: Put down?

01:01:26.807 --> 01:01:27.514
TRAVIS: In the volcano?

01:01:27.514 --> 01:01:28.482
LAURA: No no no, how are we, like--

01:01:28.482 --> 01:01:29.262
TRAVIS: Just go straight down.

01:01:29.262 --> 01:01:32.157
LAURA: At a place where we can land the carpet and
stand around.

01:01:32.157 --> 01:01:32.914
SAM: They'll probably see us.

01:01:32.914 --> 01:01:33.690
LAURA: Or should we go back?

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:34.729
LIAM: We're past the chasm at this point or still
afloat?

01:01:34.729 --> 01:01:35.953
MATT: You've just now crested--

01:01:35.953 --> 01:01:37.159
LIAM: The other side.

01:01:37.159 --> 01:01:42.554
MATT: The crevasse the other side. And you're
feeling uncomfortable pushing further forward

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:46.917
because you're now starting to get a lot more eyes
in your vicinity.

01:01:46.917 --> 01:01:50.849
LAURA: Okay, are there any-- does it look like--
do we see any cavern openings in the vicinity?

01:01:50.849 --> 01:01:52.316
Does it look like there's any?

01:01:52.316 --> 01:01:55.271
MATT: Looking around, there are no side caverns,
this is actually a pretty smooth cavern that kind

01:01:55.271 --> 01:02:00.124
of circles around where this camp is built, there
is one large tunnel entrance

01:02:00.124 --> 01:02:02.734
on the opposite side that continues past.

01:02:02.734 --> 01:02:05.220
LAURA: But they're blocking it? Or--

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:08.927
MATT: You can't see anything beyond the fact that
the tunnel-- the walls kind of convene. You can

01:02:08.999 --> 01:02:11.294
see a little bit of a tunnel opening and just
darkness beyond that.

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:14.375
LIAM: So, bridge to land, and then a tunnel.

01:02:14.375 --> 01:02:17.967
MATT: A tunnel on the other side, and where the
land starts there's a giant portion of the cavern

01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:21.769
that continues and then closes off, kind of
pinches, to the entrance to where the camp is.

01:02:21.769 --> 01:02:24.002
LAURA: How far away is the camp from that?

01:02:24.002 --> 01:02:27.279
MATT: The camp is completely filling this side of
the cross. It's blocking pretty much the whole.

01:02:27.279 --> 01:02:28.705
LAURA: Oh, so we can't get to that.

01:02:28.705 --> 01:02:29.889
MATT: Not without going through or over the city.

01:02:29.889 --> 01:02:30.551
LAURA: What about--

01:02:30.551 --> 01:02:32.282
LIAM: So it's bridge, town, tunnel.

01:02:32.282 --> 01:02:32.975
SAM: Tunnel.

01:02:32.975 --> 01:02:33.737
MATT: Correct.

01:02:33.737 --> 01:02:36.800
LAURA: Do we see any closer-- Under the bridge,
are there any openings

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.509
underneath the bridge that look like--

01:02:38.509 --> 01:02:39.611
MATT: Do you want to swoop down and check?

01:02:39.611 --> 01:02:40.084
LIAM: Yes.

01:02:40.084 --> 01:02:40.688
LAURA: Yeah.

01:02:40.688 --> 01:02:42.001
MATT: Okay, you swoop down and--

01:02:42.001 --> 01:02:43.152
LIAM: (whoosh)

01:02:43.152 --> 01:02:44.358
MATT: --the rock there--

01:02:44.358 --> 01:02:45.340
LAURA: (whoosh)

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:49.533
MATT: (whoosh) -- the warm air is still kinda
bothering you in general.

01:02:49.533 --> 01:02:50.748
LIAM: (makes farting noise)

01:02:50.748 --> 01:02:51.662
LAURA: Excuse me.

01:02:51.662 --> 01:02:55.719
MATT: You find yourself kinda taking your cloak
and putting it over your mouth just to get the

01:02:55.719 --> 01:03:04.567
scent out. The side of the rock surface is worn
through what looks like maybe a possible river

01:03:04.567 --> 01:03:07.836
that also came from the other side that has since
dried out, so you can see there is, while no water

01:03:07.836 --> 01:03:12.279
on this side of the crevasse, a lot of the stone
has been smoothed just through rapid water running

01:03:12.336 --> 01:03:16.305
for thousands of years possibly. But there are no
visible openings

01:03:16.305 --> 01:03:19.551
or other additional caverns on this rock surface

01:03:19.551 --> 01:03:20.925
LAURA: What are we gonna do?

01:03:20.925 --> 01:03:21.935
TRAVIS: (whispers) Are they still on--

01:03:21.935 --> 01:03:28.647
SAM: Okay, listen. Leave me behind, I'll follow
the party with the hostages, I'll see where they

01:03:28.647 --> 01:03:33.637
go. Don't worry, I'll be invisible. Go back, tell
our fellows, get them across the bridge,

01:03:33.637 --> 01:03:35.480
and we'll meet here in about an hour.

01:03:35.651 --> 01:03:36.902
MARISHA: Okay.

01:03:36.902 --> 01:03:37.773
LAURA: Scanlan!

01:03:37.773 --> 01:03:38.633
TRAVIS: I like it.

01:03:38.633 --> 01:03:40.341
SAM: What? I'm super brave and hung, come on,
let's do this.

01:03:40.341 --> 01:03:42.869
(all laugh)

01:03:42.869 --> 01:03:45.745
LAURA: All right, I'm down. Should we do it?

01:03:45.745 --> 01:03:46.821
LIAM: All right.

01:03:46.821 --> 01:03:47.986
LAURA: We drop him off.

01:03:47.986 --> 01:03:48.827
SAM: I turn invisible.

01:03:48.827 --> 01:03:50.336
TRAVIS: (sings) Scanlan, the best bard.

01:03:50.336 --> 01:03:52.856
SAM: And I'm gonna just hang behind the party
that's got the hostage dwarves,

01:03:52.856 --> 01:03:54.591
and just kinda see where they go.

01:03:54.591 --> 01:03:55.296
MATT: Okay.

01:03:55.296 --> 01:03:56.234
LAURA: Should one of us protect him?

01:03:56.234 --> 01:03:57.605
TRAVIS: Do you activate hung at the same time?

01:03:57.605 --> 01:03:58.373
SAM: Don't have to activate.

01:03:58.373 --> 01:03:59.293
LIAM: He's invisible, though.

01:03:59.293 --> 01:03:59.994
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:03:59.994 --> 01:04:01.075
LAURA: I mean, we can't go invisible, we can't be
as like--

01:04:01.075 --> 01:04:01.738
LIAM: No.

01:04:01.738 --> 01:04:02.571
SAM: It's passive.

01:04:02.571 --> 01:04:03.433
MARISHA: It's a racial bonus.

01:04:03.433 --> 01:04:04.687
LAURA: He's sneaky, we can't be as invisible as
him. All right.

01:04:04.687 --> 01:04:05.820
SAM: Yeah but I might make-- I might snap twigs.

01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:09.605
LIAM: Last question. Where are the people, the
figures we were following?

01:04:09.605 --> 01:04:11.145
Did they finish the bridge at this point?

01:04:11.145 --> 01:04:14.390
MATT: They're long past the bridge, they're inside
the city proper at this point.

01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:15.084
LAURA: Okay.

01:04:15.084 --> 01:04:19.859
LIAM: Okay, so then I'll stay by the edge of the
bridge, you go back. Scanlan, go ahead, I'll wait

01:04:19.859 --> 01:04:21.654
for you here, if there's trouble.

01:04:21.654 --> 01:04:23.493
SAM: Ding-a-ling-a-ling!

01:04:23.493 --> 01:04:24.308
LIAM: Yes.

01:04:24.308 --> 01:04:24.898
SAM: Got it.

01:04:24.898 --> 01:04:25.624
LAURA: All right.

01:04:25.624 --> 01:04:26.196
MATT: All right.

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:27.875
LAURA: I go back, thanks.

01:04:27.875 --> 01:04:28.498
LIAM: Shit.

01:04:28.498 --> 01:04:30.241
LAURA: Thanks for sending me back. I go back.

01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:31.427
LIAM: Go get the others.

01:04:31.427 --> 01:04:32.158
MATT: All right.

01:04:32.158 --> 01:04:33.020
MARISHA: Okay.

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:39.016
MATT: Scanlan. As you go ahead, make your way in
towards the city,

01:04:39.016 --> 01:04:40.662
go ahead and make a stealth check with advantage.

01:04:40.662 --> 01:04:42.113
TRAVIS: C'mon, buddy.

01:04:42.113 --> 01:04:46.086
SAM: 16. 18!

01:04:46.154 --> 01:04:52.457
MATT: 18, okay. You push, kind of falling behind
the main group, and they're heading towards this

01:04:52.457 --> 01:04:57.335
kind of, more or less a loose thoroughfare in the
center of this town. You can see a few duergar

01:04:57.335 --> 01:05:01.420
coming out and kind of inspecting as they enter,
speaking in a language you don't understand,

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:06.576
asking questions, some of them are coming out and
slapping the dwarf captives as they go across, or

01:05:06.576 --> 01:05:11.421
spitting on them. The dwarves look very broken and
unhappy with the circumstance, but brimming with

01:05:11.421 --> 01:05:16.595
anger. You see a couple of them are, like true
dwarves, they haven't given in to it, they're just

01:05:16.595 --> 01:05:21.599
looking for an option or a moment to get some
vengeance. They're stripped of all armor and

01:05:21.599 --> 01:05:30.746
weaponry. They're brought through some of the
alleys and paths between these pup tents and these

01:05:30.746 --> 01:05:35.956
stone structures. You can see, there are some of
the hulking figures,

01:05:35.956 --> 01:05:41.205
there are two trolls wandering amongst these 
duergar.

01:05:41.205 --> 01:05:43.431
TRAVIS: Yes! (whispers) Trolls!

01:05:43.431 --> 01:05:45.607
MATT: Now, you've encountered trolls before, but
these trolls--

01:05:45.607 --> 01:05:46.681
LAURA: (gasps) Yeah we have.

01:05:46.681 --> 01:05:50.825
MATT: -- also have a similar, pupil-less, clouded
over, white-eye appearance--

01:05:50.825 --> 01:05:52.954
SAM: Ooh! They're slave trolls!

01:05:52.954 --> 01:05:57.814
MATT: As you begin to follow them further in, you
manage to see two ogres that are currently

01:05:57.814 --> 01:06:07.072
stationed across this main open center location in
this campsite. And both of these ogres also have

01:06:07.072 --> 01:06:11.663
the same, pupil-less, white, glazed-over look to
their eyes. And they're both just kind of glancing

01:06:11.663 --> 01:06:18.536
about. The rest of the duergar are in the process
of constructing other tents. Some of them look

01:06:18.536 --> 01:06:23.815
like they're actually in the process of forging
weaponry. It feels like it's a war camp. It's

01:06:23.815 --> 01:06:28.485
definitely preparing for something. However, in
the center of this main area, you do see, there is

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:36.917
a wooden platform, about 20 foot by 20 foot, that
is raised up, and you see a group of about six

01:06:36.917 --> 01:06:42.579
duergar that are all wearing very intricate, black
iron plate armor.

01:06:42.579 --> 01:06:45.908
And they're all just sitting on the outskirts 
of this platform.

01:06:45.908 --> 01:06:47.206
SAM: White eyes?

01:06:47.206 --> 01:06:51.271
MATT: All the duergar seem to have that natural
look to their eyes as well.

01:06:51.271 --> 01:06:51.958
TRAVIS: Shit.

01:06:51.958 --> 01:06:52.969
SAM: Okay.

01:06:52.969 --> 01:06:58.866
MATT: As the party you've been following enters
the center of this vicinity,

01:06:58.866 --> 01:07:02.416
make another stealth check, with advantage.

01:07:02.416 --> 01:07:06.738
SAM: Gah. 19.

01:07:06.738 --> 01:07:12.002
MATT: All right. You kind of step off to the side,
a duergar steps out of one of the tents near you,

01:07:12.002 --> 01:07:15.200
and you just barely manage to pull out of the way
without making any sort of squeak or noise.

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:18.993
He goes by. (sniffs)

01:07:18.993 --> 01:07:19.994
TRAVIS: Oh god!

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:20.782
LAURA: Oh god!

01:07:20.782 --> 01:07:21.655
LIAM: Careful, Bilbo!

01:07:21.655 --> 01:07:26.874
MATT: And begins stepping out, looking intently
for something, but right past you, by inches, as

01:07:26.874 --> 01:07:31.870
he walks past. You look over again, to the camp,
and you can now see, toward the very back end of

01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:37.985
this open midsection, by this platform, there is
one large, stone construct. It looks like a

01:07:37.985 --> 01:07:43.187
makeshift barracks has been placed there, with
double stone doors that are currently opened, and

01:07:43.187 --> 01:07:47.475
you can see two figures stepping out of the stairs
that lead into these barracks, heading towards the

01:07:47.475 --> 01:07:54.133
main platform. They step up onto the platform. One
of which is a very, very well-decorated duergar,

01:07:54.133 --> 01:08:00.394
who's wearing similar blackened plate armor as the
other kind of elite guard that you saw surrounding

01:08:00.394 --> 01:08:06.661
this platform, but with gold and silver scrolling
on it, a long, tattered, dark, dark purple cape,

01:08:06.661 --> 01:08:14.168
and has a nasty scar across the cheek that leads
into this kind of gnarled, grey beard. As it steps

01:08:14.168 --> 01:08:19.076
forward, you can see, sheathed off to its back in
a large scabbard, a gargantuan-- for a dwarf

01:08:19.076 --> 01:08:23.130
especially-- two-handed sword that should be
unwieldy for a creature of its size. But

01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:26.768
nevertheless looks dangerous and a creature next
to it is--

01:08:26.768 --> 01:08:28.120
LAURA: (whispers) We can't fight these guys.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:33.089
MATT: -- not so small, not dwarven. Actually, very
tall, lanky, long, black and purple robes, a

01:08:33.089 --> 01:08:39.373
hood, obscuring its features, stepping roughly two
feet behind it as they both step on to the

01:08:39.373 --> 01:08:43.422
platform to address the rest of the guard and the
approaching party of duergar dwarves you've been

01:08:43.422 --> 01:08:52.617
following. You can see some conversation
happening, but you're too far away to really make

01:08:52.617 --> 01:08:54.762
out anything that's being said, do you want to
move closer?

01:08:54.762 --> 01:08:56.260
SAM: Do I speak their language?

01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:57.797
MATT: Do you speak Undercommon?

01:08:57.797 --> 01:08:58.632
SAM: Nope!

01:08:58.632 --> 01:09:00.848
MATT: Then you-- it all sounds gibberish to you!

01:09:00.848 --> 01:09:02.316
SAM: Then, no thank you. (laughs)

01:09:02.316 --> 01:09:08.663
MATT: Okay. But you see some conversation
happening. This seemingly officious duergar, this

01:09:08.663 --> 01:09:13.609
general that steps out and commands the attention
in the room, makes a few gestures, shouts out to

01:09:13.609 --> 01:09:19.962
amongst the other nearby. Not quite sure, but you
get the idea he's giving orders or directions. The

01:09:19.962 --> 01:09:23.984
war party then begins to pull the slaves back
away, and--

01:09:23.984 --> 01:09:26.733
SAM: The captives? Okay.

01:09:26.733 --> 01:09:30.609
MATT: The captives. Begins pulling them away
toward another section on the side. As it does,

01:09:30.609 --> 01:09:33.594
the tall, lanky figure, which you now get the
sense that it's not really walking.

01:09:33.594 --> 01:09:35.113
It's just kind of drifting--

01:09:35.113 --> 01:09:36.436
SAM: (apprehensive sound)

01:09:36.436 --> 01:09:42.250
MATT: -- holds its hand out. This long, long
finger and lanky hand, and as it does, every

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:45.853
single duergar in the vicinity, whatever it was
doing, stops in place,

01:09:45.853 --> 01:09:48.854
and all turn and look at it, as one.

01:09:48.854 --> 01:09:49.575
SAM: Whoa.

01:09:49.575 --> 01:09:57.272
MATT: At which point, this creature brings its
fingers in a beckoning gesture,

01:09:57.272 --> 01:09:59.986
loosely in your direction.

01:09:59.986 --> 01:10:04.658
SAM: I'm wearing my ring of mind-shielding, by the
way.

01:10:04.737 --> 01:10:09.670
MATT: For a split second, you feel your heart at
your throat, and the entire back of your body

01:10:09.753 --> 01:10:16.889
stands on pins and needles as one of the duergar
carrying one of the captives begins to pull one of

01:10:16.889 --> 01:10:23.629
the dwarven captives back towards the platform. As
it does, the dwarf, who is giving kind of a fight

01:10:23.629 --> 01:10:30.489
and looks nervous, looks over at the figure and
its arms go limp to its side, and it begins to

01:10:30.489 --> 01:10:34.794
walk out of its own volition, taking two, three
steps. Steps onto the platform and approaches this

01:10:34.794 --> 01:10:39.788
tall, lanky figure with the hood and long robes
behind it. As it does, its hand reaches out and

01:10:39.788 --> 01:10:49.805
caresses the side of this dwarf's face. This dwarf
seems to have given up all sense of fight or any

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:57.858
sort of conflict and just stares up into this
darkened hood. As the tall, lanky creature reaches

01:10:57.858 --> 01:11:02.524
out with both hands and pulls the dwarf forward,
you see these terrible purple tentacles come

01:11:02.524 --> 01:11:07.174
writhing out of the front of the hood, wrapping
around the head of the dwarf, pulling it into it.

01:11:07.174 --> 01:11:14.062
As the hood falls back, you see this horrible
smooth, purplish-blue hairless head, these sunken

01:11:14.062 --> 01:11:19.692
yellowish-green eyes as the tentacles wrap around
the dwarf's head and pulls it into its mouth.

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:26.004
There's a brief struggle, and then the dwarf's
arms fall limp to its side. At which point, the

01:11:26.004 --> 01:11:32.849
tentacles unravel from its head, the creature
pulls back, a bit of ichor and dwarf blood

01:11:32.849 --> 01:11:39.215
dripping from what looks like a lamprey's toothy
maw, and then thrusts the body to the ground, with

01:11:39.215 --> 01:11:42.356
a thud as it falls lifeless to the ground.

01:11:42.356 --> 01:11:43.779
SAM: Poor son of a bitch.

01:11:43.779 --> 01:11:50.954
MATT: A horrible, bored hole in its forehead. The
creature then draws its hood back up, releases its

01:11:50.954 --> 01:11:54.765
hand in a cursory fashion, and all the duergar
whip back around and continue the motions they

01:11:54.765 --> 01:11:59.950
were previously going towards. As the two dwarven
captives that now remain look completely stunned,

01:11:59.950 --> 01:12:07.113
their faces white with fear as they are being
dragged off in this state. The tall, lanky figure

01:12:07.113 --> 01:12:13.470
gives a nod to the duergar general, who gives a
nod as well, then to turn around and walk back.

01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:15.771
LAURA: Oh god.

01:12:15.771 --> 01:12:23.752
SAM: Worst show ever. Okay. That was one of the
captives.

01:12:23.752 --> 01:12:26.642
Do I see where the other captives were taken?

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:32.822
MATT: The two other captives, you follow them?
They both are pulled to-- essentially to a western

01:12:32.822 --> 01:12:39.421
side. If you look overhead, this is where the
barrack building is, this is where you entered and

01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:48.130
this is the main area. They are pulled off to the
western side here. They are taken to a large tent.

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:52.728
As they are pulled in, they close it behind them.
You can hear some muffles

01:12:52.728 --> 01:12:55.548
and some growling from the inside of the tent.

01:12:55.548 --> 01:13:02.274
SAM: Okay. I assume bad things are happening in
there, I don't need to see it, right? I think I'll

01:13:02.274 --> 01:13:04.781
just kind of-- is there anything--

01:13:04.781 --> 01:13:06.464
MATT: Do you speak Dwarven?

01:13:06.464 --> 01:13:11.302
SAM: No, oh, no, do I? What do I speak? Where does
it say? Shit.

01:13:11.302 --> 01:13:13.904
MATT: Should be on the lower left-hand of your
player sheet.

01:13:13.904 --> 01:13:16.548
LAURA: Did you choose languages?

01:13:16.548 --> 01:13:21.023
SAM: I play a shawm. No, I just speak Common and
Gnome.

01:13:21.023 --> 01:13:26.511
MATT: You hear what sounds like guttural Dwarvish
being shouted angrily, cursing from the interior,

01:13:26.511 --> 01:13:35.980
and a few other dwarven voices also joining in--
more than two. You hear some horrible, sick thuds

01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:42.548
and some impacts and some cries of pain. And
eventually, the five duergar dragging the captives

01:13:42.714 --> 01:13:47.418
walk out, carrying cudgels at their side, still
dripping with fresh blood.

01:13:47.418 --> 01:13:50.827
They kind of go amongst their own business 
from there.

01:13:50.827 --> 01:13:58.851
SAM: Okay. I think I'll go back to my fellows.
There's nothing I can see-- that door doesn't

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:00.971
lock-- does it lock by any chance?

01:14:00.971 --> 01:14:02.567
MATT: It's just an opening tent.

01:14:02.567 --> 01:14:09.331
SAM: Open tent. There's nothing lying around, none
of that black armor lying around or anything?

01:14:09.331 --> 01:14:11.485
Any extra things --

01:14:11.485 --> 01:14:12.800
MATT: Not on the street.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.186
SAM: Okay, I think I will just make back for my
friends, then.

01:14:16.186 --> 01:14:17.453
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:19.203
LAURA: Oh, god.

01:14:19.203 --> 01:14:19.949
SAM: With advantage?

01:14:19.949 --> 01:14:20.811
MATT: With advantage.

01:14:20.811 --> 01:14:22.517
(all laugh)

01:14:22.517 --> 01:14:25.344
SAM: 21.

01:14:25.344 --> 01:14:29.862
MATT: You maneuver your way out back the way you
came, best you can, remembering-- you get

01:14:29.862 --> 01:14:33.634
disoriented in general trying to find your way
out. Go ahead and make a survival check.

01:14:33.634 --> 01:14:35.264
LAURA: Oh no!

01:14:35.264 --> 01:14:39.590
SAM: Survival check, so plus zero. 17.

01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:40.382
MATT: 17.

01:14:40.382 --> 01:14:41.465
LAURA: That's a good roll, yo.

01:14:41.465 --> 01:14:45.753
MATT: Okay, you take a moment, orient yourself,
looking about the cavern. This is a very confusing

01:14:45.753 --> 01:14:48.062
network, and the passages you've gone-- you paid
more attention to what's happening--

01:14:48.062 --> 01:14:49.150
SAM: It's like Venice.

01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:52.543
MATT: Kind of, yeah. You nearly get lost twice,
but eventually find your way back to the

01:14:52.543 --> 01:14:58.437
southern-portion entrance of this war camp. You
can just see the crevasse and you start getting

01:14:58.437 --> 01:15:02.937
the familiar scent of that sulfurous wind that was
billowing out from underneath. You step out a few

01:15:02.937 --> 01:15:06.337
more feet, and you can see the edge of the bridge
where the rest of you have finally come to converge

01:15:06.337 --> 01:15:08.304
on the other side of the crevasse.

01:15:08.371 --> 01:15:09.226
LAURA: Ooh!

01:15:09.226 --> 01:15:13.668
SAM: Whoa. I am going to tell you everything that
just happened, in detail, in real time.

01:15:13.668 --> 01:15:18.324
(all laugh)

01:15:18.324 --> 01:15:22.382
LAURA: Maybe he can tell us while we are taking a
bathroom break?

01:15:22.382 --> 01:15:24.866
MATT: You know what, let's go ahead and take this
moment to have a bathroom break,

01:15:24.866 --> 01:15:26.541
guys, as sort of the halfway mark.

01:15:26.541 --> 01:15:27.524
MARISHA: Holy shit.

01:15:27.524 --> 01:15:31.059
MATT: We will continue this in just a moment. In
the meantime, take a rest, take ten or 11 minutes.

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:34.751
We are going to play our character backgrounds for
those who haven't seen it.

01:15:34.751 --> 01:15:36.311
We will be back here in about ten minutes, guys.

01:15:36.311 --> 01:15:37.676
MARISHA: What are we going to do?

01:15:37.676 --> 01:15:39.188
TRAVIS: We are gonna fight the shit out of them.

01:15:39.188 --> 01:15:40.227
LIAM: We're going to risk it all.

01:15:40.227 --> 01:27:10.579
[break]

01:27:10.643 --> 01:27:20.202
[no audio]

01:27:20.202 --> 01:27:25.386
MATT: -- for her as well, so look forward to that
some point in the near future. As we left off, the

01:27:25.386 --> 01:27:30.380
party had just reconvened on the other side of
this gargantuan crevasse in the Underdark, after

01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:38.362
Scanlan had stealthed into the duergar war camp,
witnessed a number of dwarven captives being taken

01:27:38.415 --> 01:27:45.774
somewhere, however, one of which was devoured by
some strange creature. Left brainless and dead on

01:27:45.774 --> 01:27:50.639
the platform in the center, outside of a giant
barracks-type building. You reconvened and

01:27:50.639 --> 01:27:52.647
expressed all of this information to the party.

01:27:52.647 --> 01:27:55.140
SAM: And that's when I came back to see you guys.

01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:56.421
(all laugh)

01:27:56.421 --> 01:27:57.225
TRAVIS: Great.

01:27:57.225 --> 01:27:59.031
TALIESIN: Wonderfully detailed.

01:27:59.031 --> 01:28:00.364
LAURA: What are we going to do?

01:28:00.364 --> 01:28:02.487
MARISHA: I give Scanlan some water from my water
skin.

01:28:02.561 --> 01:28:04.354
LIAM: You are a brave little fellow.

01:28:04.354 --> 01:28:05.742
SAM: Thank you.

01:28:05.742 --> 01:28:11.446
LAURA: Has anyone come across these creatures
before? These weird tentacle brain guys?

01:28:11.516 --> 01:28:16.174
MARISHA: I've heard rumors of those. Can we make a
check for those?

01:28:16.174 --> 01:28:19.963
ORION: It sounds like it would be a mind flayer,
of sorts.

01:28:19.963 --> 01:28:21.332
LAURA: A mind flayer?

01:28:21.332 --> 01:28:24.231
ORION: A mind flayer or mind slayer, I'm not too
sure.

01:28:24.231 --> 01:28:26.133
SAM: What is that?

01:28:26.133 --> 01:28:30.382
ORION: I'm pretty sure it flays your mind. I'm
never encountered one myself, so I have no idea,

01:28:30.382 --> 01:28:33.917
really. Oh, right, let me check my books.

01:28:33.917 --> 01:28:38.668
MATT: Intelligence.

01:28:38.668 --> 01:28:40.032
ORION: 14.

01:28:40.032 --> 01:28:42.727
MATT: You probably call it a mind flayer.

01:28:42.727 --> 01:28:48.622
ORION: It says right here, mind flayer. The rest
is all inked up. I got water on it.

01:28:48.622 --> 01:28:49.864
(all laugh)

01:28:49.864 --> 01:28:53.959
TRAVIS: How big was this mind flayer, was he like
20 feet tall, Scanlan?

01:28:53.959 --> 01:28:58.977
SAM: He was tall, I mean everyone looks 20 feet
tall to me, I'm a gnome.

01:28:58.977 --> 01:29:01.038
TRAVIS: Was he bigger than me?

01:29:01.038 --> 01:29:04.352
SAM: He was bigger than you by a little?

01:29:04.427 --> 01:29:08.757
MATT: No, roughly a little shorter than him. But
taller than most.

01:29:08.757 --> 01:29:11.574
SAM: He carried himself big. He was lanky.

01:29:11.574 --> 01:29:13.162
TRAVIS: Let's go fuck him up.

01:29:13.162 --> 01:29:14.085
LAURA: No, Grog!

01:29:14.085 --> 01:29:14.805
TRAVIS: What?

01:29:14.805 --> 01:29:18.222
LAURA: Do you want to be unconscious again? We
have to be careful here.

01:29:18.222 --> 01:29:19.689
TRAVIS: It was rather restful.

01:29:19.689 --> 01:29:23.194
LAURA: How many dwarves did it sound like there
were locked in that prison cell?

01:29:23.194 --> 01:29:25.282
SAM: Several?

01:29:25.282 --> 01:29:26.828
MARISHA: Did you see Lady Kima?

01:29:26.828 --> 01:29:35.216
SAM: No sign of Lady Kima at all, just a bunch of
dwarves being held against their will, and then

01:29:35.216 --> 01:29:39.603
one by one being brain sucked by Mr. Lanky Man.

01:29:39.603 --> 01:29:41.503
TRAVIS: And those two big trolls.

01:29:41.503 --> 01:29:43.358
ORION: Percy, could you take a look at this?

01:29:43.358 --> 01:29:45.878
SAM: Two big trolls, and ogres, don't forget
ogres, there's ogres too.

01:29:45.878 --> 01:29:46.806
TRAVIS: There are ogres?

01:29:46.806 --> 01:29:50.924
SAM: Yes, there were two big ogres as well. And
duergar aplenty--

01:29:50.924 --> 01:29:53.025
maybe four dozen or so, three dozen?

01:29:53.025 --> 01:29:57.136
LIAM: Spread throughout the city, throughout this
little camp, Scanlan.

01:29:57.136 --> 01:29:58.155
SAM: Wandering. Yes.

01:29:58.155 --> 01:29:59.155
TRAVIS: You know my tactic.

01:29:59.155 --> 01:30:01.861
TALIESIN: Would it be a nature check to actually
think if I never learned about this in school?

01:30:01.861 --> 01:30:04.149
MATT: This would be an intelligence check.

01:30:04.333 --> 01:30:06.960
TALIESIN: This would be an intelligence check?

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:14.221
TRAVIS: We should use the volcano as part of our
strategy. Like Moses--

01:30:14.221 --> 01:30:16.610
SAM: There's a volcano?

01:30:16.610 --> 01:30:18.372
TRAVIS: Well no, the pit--

01:30:18.372 --> 01:30:19.548
SAM: Oh the lava, down below?

01:30:19.548 --> 01:30:21.723
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's a shitload of that.

01:30:21.723 --> 01:30:26.860
MARISHA: Can I meditate to see if I know anything
about this--

01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:32.159
LIAM: This seems to match up with the tales that
my instructor, master Tharendril, told me about

01:30:32.159 --> 01:30:39.428
back in Syngorn. I wonder if I remember something.
If only I had a small polyhedral to roll-- Wow!

01:30:39.428 --> 01:30:40.861
LAURA: Holy moly, you guys.

01:30:40.861 --> 01:30:42.400
TRAVIS: Oh, shitcakes.

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:44.788
TALIESIN: It's a stack of pizzas.

01:30:44.788 --> 01:30:46.954
MATT: Why are you guys so awesome?

01:30:46.954 --> 01:30:48.176
LAURA: You guys are amazing!

01:30:48.176 --> 01:30:49.285
MARISHA: Yeah, what the hell?

01:30:49.285 --> 01:30:51.900
SAM: Do they know the address here? That's kinda
creepy.

01:30:51.900 --> 01:31:01.638
LAURA: Ah, thank you! I was wanting some ice tea!

01:31:01.711 --> 01:31:03.032
MARISHA: Thanks chat room!

01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:04.150
SAM: Thanks chat room!

01:31:04.208 --> 01:31:05.377
LIAM: Thanks! Thank you, long list.

01:31:05.377 --> 01:31:09.048
TRAVIS: May your list be ever long, with your--
list.

01:31:09.048 --> 01:31:16.126
MATT: So, best you can ascertain, you've never
heard the term mind flayer. But in your people

01:31:16.126 --> 01:31:20.753
you've heard stories and tales growing up about
something referred to as an illithid.

01:31:20.753 --> 01:31:21.608
TRAVIS: A what?

01:31:21.608 --> 01:31:22.457
SAM: An illithid?

01:31:22.457 --> 01:31:23.263
MARISHA: An illithid.

01:31:23.263 --> 01:31:27.073
MATT: A nasty entity, from beyond.

01:31:27.073 --> 01:31:29.042
MARISHA: Illithid, with a D or a T?

01:31:29.042 --> 01:31:36.441
MATT: With a D.

01:31:36.441 --> 01:31:40.765
As far as you know, all that you've heard,
is that they were considered ghost stories, as a

01:31:40.932 --> 01:31:49.196
kid, to keep you from wandering dark caves and
spaces. They would take your minds, and you

01:31:49.196 --> 01:31:55.273
thought this whole time that that was just a
fable. That it was just a tale. But you do know

01:31:55.273 --> 01:32:03.704
that they normally aren't solitary; they usually
keep company of a colony.

01:32:03.704 --> 01:32:04.774
LAURA: (gasps)

01:32:04.774 --> 01:32:05.407
TRAVIS: Fudge.

01:32:05.407 --> 01:32:06.180
LIAM: Shit.

01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:08.785
MARISHA: But I've never heard them called a mind
flayer, but I guess they could be called a mind

01:32:08.785 --> 01:32:15.260
flayer. But we call them Illithids. I didn't know
they were real, though.

01:32:15.490 --> 01:32:18.073
LAURA: What do we do?

01:32:18.073 --> 01:32:27.081
TRAVIS: Why don't we-- Listen, when my Herd used
to wander through the trees and we came upon a

01:32:27.081 --> 01:32:33.387
force that was greater than our own, we used the
landscape to our ad-van-tage, so why don't we

01:32:33.555 --> 01:32:38.816
provoke an attack? And then retreat over the
bridge.

01:32:38.816 --> 01:32:41.963
SAM: And have them all jump over the edge of the
cliff?

01:32:41.963 --> 01:32:43.678
TRAVIS: You said they were all gray-eyed, right?

01:32:43.678 --> 01:32:46.957
LAURA: At least they'll have to go one at a time,
or two at a time across the bridge.

01:32:46.957 --> 01:32:50.343
MARISHA: But Scanlan, didn't you also say that
they were, like, levitating?

01:32:50.343 --> 01:32:51.494
TRAVIS: What?

01:32:51.494 --> 01:32:54.253
MATT: The one lengthy creature.

01:32:54.253 --> 01:32:56.906
SAM: The one lengthy creature was levitating.

01:32:56.906 --> 01:32:58.723
LAURA: Well, I mean, can he fly, or can he
levitate?

01:32:58.723 --> 01:33:03.137
SAM: Well yes, but I think what Grog is talking
about is the bulk of the fighting force, getting

01:33:03.137 --> 01:33:05.508
them to follow us over the bridge and then cutting
the bridge.

01:33:05.508 --> 01:33:12.018
TRAVIS: Yeah, like in 300. Which was a great
puppet show I saw.

01:33:12.018 --> 01:33:15.241
ORION: Oh Grog, I heard that, where they used 300
puppets!

01:33:15.241 --> 01:33:15.986
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:33:15.986 --> 01:33:16.858
ORION: It's amazing!

01:33:16.858 --> 01:33:18.238
LAURA: Okay, I like this plan.

01:33:18.238 --> 01:33:24.154
LIAM: What if all but a couple of us snuck into
one of these buildings and waited and a couple of

01:33:24.154 --> 01:33:29.938
us made a stink and got a significant number of
them to chase across the bridge.

01:33:29.938 --> 01:33:31.197
SAM: That's a good idea.

01:33:31.197 --> 01:33:34.897
LIAM: But then how could we cut the bridge behind?
We have a flying carpet so we can go back and

01:33:34.897 --> 01:33:39.198
forth, but we could drop a significant number of
them down into the lava.

01:33:39.198 --> 01:33:45.086
MARISHA: Can we have Tiberius standing there to
just Firebolt it?

01:33:45.086 --> 01:33:46.170
TRAVIS: What's the bridge made of?

01:33:46.170 --> 01:33:47.444
SAM: Do you want the rope?

01:33:47.444 --> 01:33:49.031
ORION: Wait a minute. We want to bait them, is
that what we're trying to do?

01:33:49.031 --> 01:33:50.989
SAM: No, we want to drop the bridge and have them
fall to their deaths.

01:33:50.989 --> 01:33:51.913
LAURA: Or, Scanlan--

01:33:51.913 --> 01:33:52.632
SAM: Yes?

01:33:52.632 --> 01:33:56.498
LAURA: Or, what if you let off a stink bomb in the
middle of the camp?

01:33:56.498 --> 01:33:58.117
SAM: Well, they would run willy-nilly!

01:33:58.117 --> 01:34:01.324
LAURA: Some of them would try to leave across the
bridge.

01:34:01.324 --> 01:34:04.199
SAM: Well remember, there's a tunnel on the other
side of camp. They could run that way as well.

01:34:04.199 --> 01:34:07.508
LIAM: It's also a huge, and your stink-cloud is
only, you know, 20 or 30 feet across.

01:34:07.508 --> 01:34:08.442
SAM: 20 feet.

01:34:08.442 --> 01:34:09.412
TRAVIS: "Only".

01:34:09.412 --> 01:34:12.017
ORION: How long is the bridge?

01:34:12.017 --> 01:34:18.380
MATT: The bridge, now that you've traversed it,
it's ten feet wide, and runs about a little over

01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:20.651
200 feet or 250 feet in length.

01:34:20.651 --> 01:34:22.693
SAM: You can get a lot of them on that bridge and
then cut it.

01:34:22.693 --> 01:34:24.818
ORION: True.

01:34:24.818 --> 01:34:28.245
TRAVIS: Makes their numbers count for nothing.

01:34:28.245 --> 01:34:31.388
MARISHA: I think I've heard that one. That puppet
show.

01:34:31.388 --> 01:34:32.524
SAM: I like that idea.

01:34:32.524 --> 01:34:33.938
ORION: I think I might have a solution.

01:34:33.938 --> 01:34:35.831
LAURA: Yes, Tiberius? Speak your mind.

01:34:35.831 --> 01:34:38.372
ORION: I think it's about time I used these.

01:34:38.372 --> 01:34:39.390
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

01:34:39.390 --> 01:34:44.070
ORION: For non-combat things. I think we should
create a diversion, but let me do it. I can use my

01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:48.711
deck of illusions to generate any kind of number
of sorts of creatures or whatever that I can

01:34:48.711 --> 01:34:56.067
control. I can simply toss one out, I believe 50
feet ahead of me, and control it and get their

01:34:56.067 --> 01:35:01.272
attention. I can draw them back through the
bridge, using the illusions, taunting them along

01:35:01.272 --> 01:35:07.648
the way. They, of course, will give chase, because
they are (chuckles) idiots. And, as soon as we get

01:35:07.648 --> 01:35:11.300
enough, we can all-- you can hack away at the
bridge all you like, Grog.

01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:13.379
We could both burn it, we could hack and burn.

01:35:13.379 --> 01:35:15.152
TRAVIS: What kind of creatures can you make?

01:35:15.152 --> 01:35:17.276
ORION: Well, that's all up to the deck.

01:35:17.276 --> 01:35:18.840
SAM: It's up to the deck, or it's up to you?

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:19.938
ORION: It's up to the deck.

01:35:19.938 --> 01:35:20.940
LAURA: Let's try it!

01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:23.412
SAM: So, what if it's a scary thing that scares
them away?

01:35:23.412 --> 01:35:32.289
ORION: If I generate something such as-- as
exquisite as a red dragon, say, I'm sure somebody

01:35:32.289 --> 01:35:35.911
like the mindfellows-- If they do flee, the camp
will be empty and we can search it and free the

01:35:35.911 --> 01:35:39.948
slaves. If not, they will give chase and they will
come and bait it.

01:35:39.948 --> 01:35:41.648
Either way, it works in our favor.

01:35:41.648 --> 01:35:45.666
TRAVIS: Can I test something real quick? If I pull
out the magic carpet or I take it back from

01:35:45.704 --> 01:35:52.978
whoever the fuck had it, and I stand on it, does
it hold me up or do I sink?

01:35:52.978 --> 01:35:58.990
MATT: You get on top of the carpet and you will it
to begin to shift, and the carpet around you

01:35:58.990 --> 01:36:03.001
lifts, but you are anchoring it to the ground.

01:36:03.001 --> 01:36:04.394
TRAVIS: So this is a big problem.

01:36:04.394 --> 01:36:06.588
LAURA: But you've got Feather Fall. You've got
Feather Fall! Is that still a thing?

01:36:06.588 --> 01:36:08.351
TRAVIS: Yeah, which just slows my fall. It doesn't
take me across.

01:36:08.351 --> 01:36:09.942
SAM: That might not be a thing anymore.

01:36:09.942 --> 01:36:10.820
ORION: I do have Feather Fall.

01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:13.531
LAURA: But Levitate or something-- but we could
tie a rope to you and it can--

01:36:13.531 --> 01:36:14.687
LIAM: It makes him lighter, yeah.

01:36:14.687 --> 01:36:17.936
LAURA: -- it makes you really light, and we can
just drag you behind us. Yeah, it'll work.

01:36:17.936 --> 01:36:19.715
SAM: Why do we need to float Grog?

01:36:19.715 --> 01:36:20.657
TRAVIS: If we cut the bridge.

01:36:20.657 --> 01:36:21.933
LAURA: In case we destroy the bridge.

01:36:21.933 --> 01:36:22.753
SAM: Oh.

01:36:22.753 --> 01:36:25.734
ORION: Oh, don't worry about that, Grog. I'll just
cast Fly on you, because I can fly.

01:36:25.734 --> 01:36:27.133
TRAVIS: You can just Fly me?

01:36:27.133 --> 01:36:29.419
ORION: Yes. We can both fly.

01:36:29.419 --> 01:36:30.275
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:36:30.275 --> 01:36:31.769
LAURA: And you can Fly Trinket, too?

01:36:31.769 --> 01:36:32.675
ORION: Of course, the bear.

01:36:32.675 --> 01:36:33.430
LAURA: Of course.

01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:34.212
TRAVIS: I'm down for doing this.

01:36:34.212 --> 01:36:35.049
LAURA: Let's do it! Do it!

01:36:35.049 --> 01:36:36.011
MARISHA: Flying from the--

01:36:36.011 --> 01:36:36.785
ORION: We have ways across.

01:36:36.785 --> 01:36:38.195
MARISHA: Okay, okay, hang on, hang on.

01:36:38.195 --> 01:36:39.159
TALIESIN: This is a good plan.

01:36:39.159 --> 01:36:39.947
SAM: Wait, wait, wait. Are we--

01:36:39.947 --> 01:36:41.758
MARISHA: So, let's have a failsafe in case a few
get across the bridge.

01:36:41.758 --> 01:36:45.043
SAM: Let's also recap which plan we're going with.
One of us creating a diversion and running away,

01:36:45.043 --> 01:36:46.945
or these mystical, magical--

01:36:46.945 --> 01:36:48.003
TRAVIS: I like the mystical, magical--

01:36:48.003 --> 01:36:51.037
SAM: -- weird dragon creatures. What if they scare
them the other way?

01:36:51.037 --> 01:36:53.123
TALIESIN: It would have to be pretty scary. And
then, hey, that works.

01:36:53.123 --> 01:36:54.990
ORION: I just said, the path would be clear.

01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:55.910
SAM: What if--

01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:57.526
LIAM: Well, are we scaring them or are we luring
them?

01:36:57.526 --> 01:36:58.783
SAM: Also, might I remind--

01:36:58.783 --> 01:37:00.412
ORION: It's all up to the deck.

01:37:00.412 --> 01:37:03.119
SAM: We're luring them. And also, might I remind
you all, that they're being

01:37:03.119 --> 01:37:07.489
mind controlled by this, what, illithid--

01:37:07.489 --> 01:37:08.503
TRAVIS: Davy Jones.

01:37:08.503 --> 01:37:09.298
LAURA: I feel like we should try to--

01:37:09.298 --> 01:37:10.476
MARISHA: Illithid.

01:37:10.476 --> 01:37:12.434
SAM: And if the illithid recognizes that your--

01:37:12.434 --> 01:37:14.430
LAURA: Wait, wait!

01:37:14.430 --> 01:37:16.883
SAM: -- your things are false, then he's not going
to send his men--

01:37:16.883 --> 01:37:17.793
LAURA: That's true.

01:37:17.793 --> 01:37:18.960
SAM: -- off to chase them.

01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:20.883
TALIESIN: Or he may send them to kill whoever is
creating the illusion.

01:37:20.883 --> 01:37:21.543
ORION: Exactly.

01:37:21.543 --> 01:37:24.451
SAM: However, if we were-- hm.

01:37:24.451 --> 01:37:25.543
ORION: Either way, they're coming for us.

01:37:25.543 --> 01:37:30.274
LAURA: Maybe we could create a distraction and
bring them away from the tunnel's entrance and we

01:37:30.274 --> 01:37:34.643
can just sneak around them. No?

01:37:34.643 --> 01:37:37.264
ORION: I mean, did you see a way to do that?

01:37:37.264 --> 01:37:41.186
SAM: What? To sneak through the village to the
tunnel? No! Not all seven of us.

01:37:41.186 --> 01:37:43.353
And a bear. Are you crazy?

01:37:43.353 --> 01:37:45.974
(all laugh)

01:37:45.974 --> 01:37:50.229
LAURA: Oh no, he's trying to kill us. All right.

01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:54.787
TRAVIS: I'll stay on this side of the bridge, who
wants to go be a distraction? Who wants to be the

01:37:54.787 --> 01:37:56.807
bait? Who's real fast?

01:37:56.807 --> 01:37:58.814
SAM: Wait, are we doing his bait or are we doing a
real bait?

01:37:58.814 --> 01:37:59.571
TRAVIS: I don't--

01:37:59.571 --> 01:38:00.611
ORION: We can try both.

01:38:00.611 --> 01:38:02.812
TRAVIS: What if you cast something big and they
turn it against us? That could suck.

01:38:02.812 --> 01:38:04.336
ORION: Oh!

01:38:04.336 --> 01:38:06.057
SAM: It's fake. It's just a hologram.

01:38:06.057 --> 01:38:06.812
LAURA: It's not--

01:38:06.812 --> 01:38:07.789
ORION: It's an illusion that I control.

01:38:07.789 --> 01:38:09.042
TRAVIS: How about we throw one of those and
send--

01:38:09.042 --> 01:38:09.801
LAURA: Yeah.

01:38:09.801 --> 01:38:13.902
TRAVIS: How about 50/50 it? One fake, one real.
One of us, one of the cards.

01:38:13.902 --> 01:38:15.133
LIAM: I'll go.

01:38:15.133 --> 01:38:16.310
TRAVIS: Somebody be Gambit and throw that bitch.

01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:18.471
MARISHA: We really just need someone to keep them
from running through that tunnel.

01:38:18.471 --> 01:38:19.188
LAURA: Yeah.

01:38:19.188 --> 01:38:20.519
MARISHA: We need some way to keep them from
coming-- going--

01:38:20.519 --> 01:38:23.784
LAURA: Can you send a card that looks like a
dragon on the other side, in the tunnel,

01:38:23.784 --> 01:38:25.698
and then they run towards us.

01:38:25.698 --> 01:38:27.061
MARISHA: Oh, oh, oh! Wait, wait.

01:38:27.061 --> 01:38:28.049
TRAVIS: What's wrong with them running away from
us?

01:38:28.049 --> 01:38:28.957
SAM: Oh, snap.

01:38:28.957 --> 01:38:35.069
MARISHA: I actually have a spell, while I was
reading through my book last night, catching up on

01:38:35.069 --> 01:38:40.979
spells that I kinda forgot about. I learned
something called Hallucinatory Terrain, where I

01:38:40.979 --> 01:38:45.334
can make the entire terrain look like whatever I
want.

01:38:45.334 --> 01:38:47.107
SAM: Other terrain or an animal?

01:38:47.107 --> 01:38:48.320
MARISHA: Other terrain.

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:50.000
TRAVIS: They're mind controlled--

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.374
MARISHA: What I can do, is--

01:38:51.374 --> 01:38:54.611
LAURA: You can make the chasm look like it's solid
ground!

01:38:54.611 --> 01:38:56.990
SAM: Can you make the chasm look like it's solid
ground?

01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.627
TRAVIS: Ooh!

01:38:57.627 --> 01:38:59.182
MARISHA: I can make the chasm look like it's solid
ground--

01:38:59.182 --> 01:39:00.234
SAM: Can she do this?

01:39:00.234 --> 01:39:01.315
MATT: She can try.

01:39:01.315 --> 01:39:01.979
SAM: Yes!

01:39:01.979 --> 01:39:02.794
TRAVIS: I like it!

01:39:02.794 --> 01:39:03.979
MARISHA: I can make the tunnel across the way look
like it's caved in.

01:39:03.979 --> 01:39:06.205
LAURA: Make the big chasm look like solid ground.
They'll fall off the edge!

01:39:06.205 --> 01:39:07.107
TALIESIN: That's a great plan.

01:39:07.107 --> 01:39:08.128
LIAM: That's a great idea, but let's--

01:39:08.128 --> 01:39:09.709
ORION: I'll throw the illusion on the fake lands.

01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:13.171
LIAM: -- let's stack the deck, all right? I'm
still gonna be live bait, because I have an

01:39:13.245 --> 01:39:16.244
inkling that that thing, whatever it is, with the
tentacles on its face--

01:39:16.244 --> 01:39:17.328
SAM: Is gonna see through that.

01:39:17.328 --> 01:39:22.532
LIAM: -- is going to see through it. So if we've
got one real half-elf in the mix, he'll focus on me.

01:39:22.532 --> 01:39:25.026
So I'll take the flying carpet and tie it around
my back.

01:39:25.099 --> 01:39:26.502
LAURA: You better run fast and not get taken!

01:39:26.502 --> 01:39:27.478
LIAM: I have boots of haste.

01:39:27.478 --> 01:39:28.888
MARISHA: Are you good with hauling ass?

01:39:28.888 --> 01:39:29.586
LIAM: Mm?

01:39:29.586 --> 01:39:30.374
LAURA: (laughs)

01:39:30.374 --> 01:39:31.352
MARISHA: Okay. As long as you can haul ass.

01:39:31.352 --> 01:39:31.930
TRAVIS: All right.

01:39:31.930 --> 01:39:32.666
LIAM: So I take the rug from Grog--

01:39:32.666 --> 01:39:33.358
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:39:33.358 --> 01:39:35.733
LIAM: I'm gonna roll it up and I tie it, I have a
rope to tie it to my back.

01:39:35.733 --> 01:39:36.793
LAURA: It's a big rug on your back.

01:39:36.793 --> 01:39:37.955
TRAVIS: Saddle up, let's do it.

01:39:37.955 --> 01:39:39.305
MATT: It's a very big rug.

01:39:39.305 --> 01:39:39.778
LIAM: Is it?

01:39:39.778 --> 01:39:40.743
MATT: What's your strength?

01:39:40.743 --> 01:39:42.200
LIAM: It is--

01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:43.263
LAURA: It's a big-ass rug.

01:39:43.263 --> 01:39:43.902
SAM: Wait.

01:39:43.902 --> 01:39:44.550
LIAM: 14?

01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:45.647
LAURA: It'd be like carrying a--

01:39:45.647 --> 01:39:47.713
MATT: It won't be cumbersome, necessarily.

01:39:47.713 --> 01:39:50.381
MARISHA: Before Liam-- before Vax leaves--

01:39:50.381 --> 01:39:53.807
SAM: Wait! Might I interject? I'm so sorry.

01:39:53.807 --> 01:39:55.002
MARISHA: Go ahead.

01:39:55.002 --> 01:39:59.384
SAM: You guys-- You and you will be hauling ass
away from the charging horde--

01:39:59.384 --> 01:39:59.948
LAURA: You? You're not--

01:39:59.948 --> 01:40:00.544
TRAVIS: No, no--

01:40:00.544 --> 01:40:01.309
LAURA: No, just him.

01:40:01.309 --> 01:40:02.630
TRAVIS: I'm staying on our side of the bridge.

01:40:02.705 --> 01:40:03.969
SAM: On our side.

01:40:03.969 --> 01:40:04.824
TRAVIS: Our side.

01:40:04.824 --> 01:40:06.231
LAURA: But he's got a rug, he's got the flying
carpet.

01:40:06.231 --> 01:40:07.611
TALIESIN: So we're gonna make them hallucinate--

01:40:07.611 --> 01:40:10.546
SAM: So, when you get all the way to the other
side of the bridge, then we're gonna chop.

01:40:10.546 --> 01:40:11.488
TRAVIS: No.

01:40:11.488 --> 01:40:15.488
LAURA: No, we're gonna chop it when they start
coming across the bridge. We're hoping that

01:40:15.488 --> 01:40:17.698
they're gonna just fall off the edge instead.

01:40:17.698 --> 01:40:18.466
ORION: Run off the bridge--

01:40:18.466 --> 01:40:19.571
TRAVIS: They go, (yells)

01:40:19.571 --> 01:40:21.161
SAM: Which side are we gonna chop it on? Our side
or their side?

01:40:21.161 --> 01:40:22.171
TRAVIS: Once he gets back to our side.

01:40:22.171 --> 01:40:22.815
LAURA: Our side!

01:40:22.815 --> 01:40:23.552
SAM: Okay.

01:40:23.552 --> 01:40:25.919
TRAVIS: (yells) They come back, everybody falls
in--

01:40:25.919 --> 01:40:27.388
LIAM: What's the bridge made of? Is it just rope
and wood?

01:40:27.388 --> 01:40:28.167
SAM: Rope.

01:40:28.167 --> 01:40:31.854
MATT: From what it looks like, it is rope and
stone platforms.

01:40:31.854 --> 01:40:32.730
LAURA: Oh.

01:40:32.730 --> 01:40:33.704
LIAM: On both sides?

01:40:33.704 --> 01:40:35.779
MATT: Like slats, slats of stone, that then the
rope is tied around.

01:40:35.779 --> 01:40:36.384
LAURA: Okay.

01:40:36.384 --> 01:40:38.008
MATT: It's a very, very thick, hefty twine.

01:40:38.008 --> 01:40:39.100
LAURA: He can cut through that.

01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:41.137
TRAVIS: All right. So Tiberius and Vax are going
over.

01:40:41.137 --> 01:40:41.975
LAURA: All right!

01:40:41.975 --> 01:40:42.628
TRAVIS: Do it.

01:40:42.628 --> 01:40:48.527
MARISHA: Before Vax leaves, I just put my hands on
his shoulders, and I cast Enhance Ability on him,

01:40:48.527 --> 01:40:51.590
and give you a dexterity boost.

01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:52.681
LIAM: Okay.

01:40:52.681 --> 01:40:54.433
SAM: I'm also going to sing a little song--

01:40:54.433 --> 01:40:55.722
MARISHA: So you have advantage on all dex rolls.

01:40:55.722 --> 01:40:56.644
SAM: -- for both of them--

01:40:56.644 --> 01:40:57.755
LIAM: So what's the boost? How high is it?

01:40:57.755 --> 01:40:58.788
SAM: -- to inspire them.

01:40:58.788 --> 01:40:59.542
MARISHA: You have the advantage--

01:40:59.542 --> 01:41:00.107
LIAM: Advantage.

01:41:00.107 --> 01:41:00.760
MARISHA: -- on all dex rolls.

01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:01.670
LIAM: On all dex rolls. All right.

01:41:01.670 --> 01:41:02.641
MARISHA: If that comes to that.

01:41:02.641 --> 01:41:04.143
LIAM: That's great, because that's how I attack.

01:41:04.143 --> 01:41:06.272
MATT: Well, advantage on dex ability checks.

01:41:06.272 --> 01:41:06.826
LIAM: Okay.

01:41:06.826 --> 01:41:07.521
MARISHA: Ability checks.

01:41:07.521 --> 01:41:09.519
MATT: Like acrobatics, things like that, sleight
of hand, stealth.

01:41:09.519 --> 01:41:10.330
LIAM: All right.

01:41:10.330 --> 01:41:11.181
TRAVIS: Is Scanlan singing?

01:41:11.181 --> 01:41:12.824
SAM: Oh, yes, I'll sing an inspiration song for
both of them.

01:41:12.824 --> 01:41:13.515
MATT: Okay, so--

01:41:13.515 --> 01:41:15.432
SAM: (sings) Hey baby, hey baby, hey!

01:41:15.432 --> 01:41:15.998
LIAM: But we need to--

01:41:15.998 --> 01:41:17.718
SAM: (sings) Dwarves say. Dwarves say.

01:41:17.718 --> 01:41:18.482
(all laugh)

01:41:18.482 --> 01:41:23.412
SAM: (sings) Hey baby, hey baby, hey! On to the
bridge and fall down.

01:41:23.412 --> 01:41:26.812
(all laugh)

01:41:26.812 --> 01:41:28.094
MATT: All right! So.

01:41:28.094 --> 01:41:31.834
TRAVIS: Was that Gwen Stefani?

01:41:31.834 --> 01:41:32.616
LAURA: All right! (laughs)

01:41:32.616 --> 01:41:34.767
MATT: So, inspiration dice to Vax, and who else?

01:41:34.767 --> 01:41:35.599
MARISHA: I hope this works.

01:41:35.599 --> 01:41:37.834
MATT: Vax and who else? Gets inspiration dice?
Scanlan.

01:41:37.834 --> 01:41:40.236
SAM: Oh, I'm sorry, these two-- Grog and Vax.

01:41:40.236 --> 01:41:42.518
MATT: Okay. So both of you guys have a d8 of
inspiration dice you can spend.

01:41:42.518 --> 01:41:43.393
SAM: Oh! Are you going too?

01:41:43.393 --> 01:41:45.658
LAURA: Yeah, no, Grog isn't going, Tiberius is
going.

01:41:45.658 --> 01:41:47.146
SAM: I'm sorry. Tiberius and Vax, then.

01:41:47.146 --> 01:41:48.020
MATT: Okay. There you go.

01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:49.218
TRAVIS: You could have gave it to me.

01:41:49.218 --> 01:41:52.138
LIAM: But, Tiberius, walk on a bit behind me, and
I'm gonna walk up

01:41:52.138 --> 01:41:54.677
to the edge of town, and I'm gonna chat.

01:41:54.677 --> 01:41:55.439
MATT: Okay.

01:41:55.439 --> 01:41:56.794
LAURA: Oh my god. What if you-- What!

01:41:56.794 --> 01:41:58.592
MATT: So, before this happens, where's everyone
placed? You guys--

01:41:58.592 --> 01:41:59.951
LIAM: Yeah, where are you guys--

01:41:59.951 --> 01:42:00.792
LAURA: Oh my God.

01:42:00.792 --> 01:42:01.973
MATT: You guys are across the bridge.

01:42:01.973 --> 01:42:02.652
LAURA: Yes.

01:42:02.652 --> 01:42:03.352
MATT: Where's the rest of you?

01:42:03.352 --> 01:42:06.739
TALIESIN: I'm gonna set up on our side of the
bridge, I'm gonna set up the Bad News gun and get

01:42:06.739 --> 01:42:09.570
ready to train it on whatever might try and come
across.

01:42:09.570 --> 01:42:10.392
MATT: Okay.

01:42:10.392 --> 01:42:14.050
LAURA: Are there any big rock formations that I
can sort of use as a shelter and kind of stay

01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:16.260
behind that but also peek around?

01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:21.341
MATT: About 20 feet off from the edge, on the
goblin side, there is one outcropping of, like, a

01:42:21.399 --> 01:42:23.110
large stalagmite that you could probably get
behind.

01:42:23.110 --> 01:42:24.226
LAURA: Oh, on the goblin side?

01:42:24.226 --> 01:42:25.820
MATT: On the goblin side. Oh, do you wanna be on
their side?

01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:27.820
LAURA: I want to be on our side.

01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:31.807
MATT: Your side, meaning the side that the war
camp is on.

01:42:31.807 --> 01:42:34.556
LAURA: No. I thought we were all on the other side
of the bridge.

01:42:34.556 --> 01:42:36.909
SAM: We're gonna stay on the side that doesn't
have all the bad guys on it.

01:42:36.909 --> 01:42:40.439
MATT: Right. There's the goblin side, which is
where you guys first went through, there's the

01:42:40.498 --> 01:42:42.724
bridge, and then there's the war camp side.

01:42:42.724 --> 01:42:44.070
LAURA and TRAVIS: Goblin side.

01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:47.774
MATT: All right. So you're on-- Goblin side for
you, Goblin side for Grog--

01:42:47.774 --> 01:42:48.543
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:42:48.543 --> 01:42:51.302
MATT: Goblin side for Percy, setting up the Bad
News, your crazy gun.

01:42:51.302 --> 01:42:52.217
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

01:42:52.217 --> 01:42:53.279
LAURA: You're on the war camp side

01:42:53.279 --> 01:42:54.097
TALIESIN: Gonna be great.

01:42:54.097 --> 01:42:54.893
MATT: And Scanlan as well.

01:42:54.893 --> 01:42:56.064
LIAM: Right, and I'm gonna run that, but you guys
are all going back to--

01:42:56.064 --> 01:42:56.981
LAURA: We're on the goblin side.

01:42:56.981 --> 01:42:58.916
LIAM: The safer side. The further side.

01:42:58.969 --> 01:42:59.857
LAURA: Yeah.

01:42:59.857 --> 01:43:02.964
MARISHA: I'm gonna be-- Can I be like halfway in
between on the bridge? Is that a bad idea?

01:43:02.964 --> 01:43:04.011
MATT: You can do that. It's up to you.

01:43:04.011 --> 01:43:05.297
TRAVIS: Go for it! You can fly.

01:43:05.297 --> 01:43:06.979
LAURA: Can she fly?

01:43:06.979 --> 01:43:07.901
MATT: Turn into birds.

01:43:07.901 --> 01:43:08.802
MARISHA: I can turn into a bird.

01:43:08.802 --> 01:43:09.501
MATT: She's a druid.

01:43:09.501 --> 01:43:10.605
LAURA: Oh! You can turn into a bird!

01:43:10.605 --> 01:43:11.246
TRAVIS: Yeah. She's fine.

01:43:11.246 --> 01:43:12.897
LAURA: How long does your spell cast? I mean, your
spell last?

01:43:12.897 --> 01:43:13.733
TRAVIS: (snickers)

01:43:13.733 --> 01:43:14.625
LAURA: Shut up.

01:43:14.625 --> 01:43:15.613
MARISHA: My-- which one?

01:43:15.613 --> 01:43:16.968
LAURA: Your illusion spell.

01:43:16.968 --> 01:43:20.041
MARISHA: It's a concentration thing. So, as long
as I can keep it up.

01:43:20.041 --> 01:43:21.430
LAURA: So, maybe you should do that--

01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:26.915
MARISHA: Oh. Yeah, for up to 30-- 24 hours,
actually. It's not a concentration spell.

01:43:26.915 --> 01:43:29.502
LAURA: So, how far does it reach?

01:43:29.502 --> 01:43:30.744
MARISHA: 300 feet.

01:43:30.744 --> 01:43:31.594
LAURA: Okay.

01:43:31.594 --> 01:43:34.168
MARISHA: 150 square feet.

01:43:34.168 --> 01:43:35.352
MATT: Right. Okay.

01:43:35.352 --> 01:43:36.224
LIAM: Just needs to--

01:43:36.224 --> 01:43:37.007
MARISHA: And it looks, sounds--

01:43:37.007 --> 01:43:38.074
LIAM: -- work around the edge of the bridge.

01:43:38.074 --> 01:43:39.738
MARISHA: -- smells, like some other sort of
natural terrain.

01:43:39.738 --> 01:43:41.853
MATT: So, what are you going to make the terrain
look like? What is your alteration?

01:43:41.853 --> 01:43:47.085
MARISHA: So, what I'm doing, whenever we-- can I
make it look like

01:43:47.085 --> 01:43:49.343
there's a cave-in happening through the tunnel?

01:43:49.343 --> 01:43:52.773
LAURA: (whispers) Wait! No! Make it look like it's
really far--

01:43:52.773 --> 01:43:54.281
LIAM: Keyleth, what if you fudged it so the
cliff--

01:43:54.281 --> 01:43:55.324
MARISHA: Well, that's what I'm gonna do.

01:43:55.324 --> 01:43:56.449
LIAM: -- looked like it went 30 feet further out.

01:43:56.449 --> 01:43:58.956
MARISHA: Yeah. What I'm gonna do, I just want the
terrain to look, on my side--

01:43:58.956 --> 01:43:59.859
LIAM: Close to what they're used to.

01:43:59.859 --> 01:44:03.133
MARISHA: I want the terrain to look exactly like
what it is, but I just wanna stretch it out a

01:44:03.133 --> 01:44:07.379
little bit, so it looks like they've got, like, an
extra running space.

01:44:07.379 --> 01:44:08.240
MATT: Okay, okay.

01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:09.266
LIAM: Yeah, so if it looks too different--

01:44:09.266 --> 01:44:10.687
MATT: So like an additional 40 or so feet out from
the actual--

01:44:10.687 --> 01:44:15.021
MARISHA: Yes. Of actual, yes. Like the bridge is
an extra 40 feet away.

01:44:15.021 --> 01:44:18.522
MATT: Okay. The actual ceiling is maybe about 120
feet up, so it might be a little hard to do that,

01:44:18.522 --> 01:44:19.998
and cause a cave-in-type illusion.

01:44:19.998 --> 01:44:22.995
MARISHA: Okay. Then I'll do that. Then I'm gonna
just-- you know what, I'm gonna stay on the

01:44:23.051 --> 01:44:25.401
opposite side of the bridge, and I'm gonna focus
on making that illusion.

01:44:25.401 --> 01:44:28.910
MATT: Okay. Cool. So you go ahead and you cast
Hallucinatory Terrain--

01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:29.718
MARISHA: Yep.

01:44:29.718 --> 01:44:30.553
LAURA: (yells)

01:44:30.553 --> 01:44:33.174
MATT: You now see an additional 40 feet of the
cliff stretching out--

01:44:33.174 --> 01:44:34.211
LAURA: It looks very realistic.

01:44:34.211 --> 01:44:34.972
MARISHA: Thank you!

01:44:34.972 --> 01:44:37.085
MATT: And you can actually see that the bridge
looks attached to it, it's a very, very convincing

01:44:37.085 --> 01:44:41.831
illusion. And you kind of have to remind yourself
that it's an illusion, just so you don't fall for

01:44:41.831 --> 01:44:42.979
it either!

01:44:42.979 --> 01:44:44.566
MARISHA: Yes, be careful guys, please be careful!

01:44:44.566 --> 01:44:46.486
MATT: All right. So you're kind of chilling in the
middle of the bridge?

01:44:46.486 --> 01:44:47.347
MARISHA: Mm-hm.

01:44:47.347 --> 01:44:48.414
MATT: All right. The rest of you are--

01:44:48.414 --> 01:44:49.612
MARISHA: All right, I'm on the outside of the
bridge.

01:44:49.612 --> 01:44:50.782
MATT: -- on the other side-- outside of the
bridge.

01:44:50.782 --> 01:44:51.845
MARISHA: I'm out with them.

01:44:51.845 --> 01:44:52.827
MATT: Okay. So you're off the bridge now.

01:44:52.827 --> 01:44:53.647
MARISHA: Gone. Yeah.

01:44:53.647 --> 01:44:59.921
MATT: All right. So now, Tiberius, Vax, you guys
walk across the bridge, keeping grip both side

01:44:59.921 --> 01:45:04.440
rails, feeling it rock to and fro from the
continuous warm bellowing of wind up from the

01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:10.509
cavern beneath you. Eventually you bring your way
across. What looks like you should be stepping on

01:45:10.509 --> 01:45:14.088
terrain is still the bridge, and it takes you a
minute to adjust to the fact that you're still

01:45:14.088 --> 01:45:17.592
going across the bridge, but it looks like rocky
terrain. Eventually you make it to the other side

01:45:17.592 --> 01:45:21.789
and you grab purchase on stone. Looking ahead of
you, you can see about 60 feet ahead of you the

01:45:21.789 --> 01:45:24.787
outskirts of the war camp.

01:45:24.787 --> 01:45:25.732
LIAM: Okay.

01:45:25.732 --> 01:45:31.892
Tiberius, you wait here, ready to run. I
take Tiberius by the arm like this. Vox Machina.

01:45:32.123 --> 01:45:34.059
ORION: Vox Machina.

01:45:34.059 --> 01:45:35.233
(all laugh)

01:45:35.233 --> 01:45:42.768
LIAM: Okay. So I stealthily walk up to the
closing distance to the edge of town and I stand

01:45:42.839 --> 01:45:45.637
there. I click my boots of haste together.

01:45:45.637 --> 01:45:46.514
LAURA: Oh god.

01:45:46.514 --> 01:45:51.043
ORION: As he runs off I cast Greater Invisibility
on myself.

01:45:51.043 --> 01:45:51.790
MATT: All right.

01:45:51.790 --> 01:45:54.260
ORION: I cast Fly on myself and I hover.

01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:57.234
MATT: Both of those are concentration spells.

01:45:57.234 --> 01:45:58.238
ORION: Fuck!

01:45:58.238 --> 01:46:01.081
MATT: You can only have one of those up at any
given point in time.

01:46:01.081 --> 01:46:02.587
ORION: I'll cast Fly, then.

01:46:02.587 --> 01:46:03.167
MATT: Okay.

01:46:03.167 --> 01:46:03.932
ORION: Yes.

01:46:03.932 --> 01:46:06.069
MATT: So you're now floating up. Okay.

01:46:06.069 --> 01:46:07.197
LIAM: Okay.

01:46:07.197 --> 01:46:11.033
ORION: And I'm at enough edge to where her
illusions are, as well.

01:46:11.033 --> 01:46:12.398
MATT: Okay.

01:46:12.398 --> 01:46:14.219
ORION: But over the bridge just in case I fall.

01:46:14.219 --> 01:46:15.075
LAURA: (laughs)

01:46:15.075 --> 01:46:17.628
MATT: Okay, all right. So you're now just kinda
hovering above the bridge now. You--

01:46:17.628 --> 01:46:19.024
LIAM: I just clicked the boots.

01:46:19.024 --> 01:46:21.874
MATT: You feel the sudden surge of magical energy
through your body like

01:46:21.874 --> 01:46:24.032
adrenaline just pumping into your system.

01:46:24.032 --> 01:46:31.736
LIAM: And I cry out full voice, listen up, you
walking prawn, doom has come for you today.

01:46:31.736 --> 01:46:35.221
Step forth, you slimy bastard.

01:46:35.221 --> 01:46:36.612
LAURA: Oh fuck.

01:46:36.612 --> 01:46:37.339
(all laugh)

01:46:37.339 --> 01:46:38.837
ORION: As he does that I toss out three cards.

01:46:38.837 --> 01:46:39.612
MATT: All right.

01:46:39.612 --> 01:46:40.600
LAURA: Oh gosh.

01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:45.167
LIAM: Your trolls can't save you.

01:46:45.167 --> 01:46:48.457
ORION: Right at the rim of where the illusion
stops.

01:46:48.463 --> 01:46:50.068
LAURA: I will find you.

01:46:50.068 --> 01:46:52.379
LIAM: No matter how far or how long.

01:46:52.379 --> 01:46:55.577
MATT: Been awhile since you've used those. 
(laughs) All right. Oh, okay.

01:46:55.577 --> 01:46:57.965
You shuffled these, right?

01:46:57.965 --> 01:46:59.757
TRAVIS: We should call this a rim job.

01:46:59.757 --> 01:47:00.564
ORION: Yes.

01:47:00.564 --> 01:47:02.728
MATT: All right. This will be very, very
interesting.

01:47:02.808 --> 01:47:03.571
LIAM: Oh Jesus.

01:47:03.571 --> 01:47:05.176
LAURA: Oh god.

01:47:05.176 --> 01:47:07.120
TALIESIN: This is a good plan.

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:07.943
SAM: You got your dice?

01:47:07.943 --> 01:47:08.775
TRAVIS: Sure it is.

01:47:08.775 --> 01:47:09.539
LIAM: It's a great plan.

01:47:09.539 --> 01:47:10.297
SAM: Use your dice.

01:47:10.297 --> 01:47:11.265
MARISHA: Are you convincing yourself or are you--

01:47:11.265 --> 01:47:12.328
TALIESIN: This is a good plan.

01:47:12.328 --> 01:47:13.883
TRAVIS: We're on the safe side with Bad News and
me.

01:47:13.883 --> 01:47:15.000
TALIESIN: We're fine.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.152
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm with you guys. We're fine.

01:47:17.152 --> 01:47:25.326
MATT: So currently one of the cards bursts and you
can see rising up from its energy this

01:47:25.557 --> 01:47:32.834
awful-looking humanoid skeletal undead creature
with long golden red robes, with this gnarled gold

01:47:32.834 --> 01:47:36.992
crown and these glowing blue eyes and just pure
arcane energy

01:47:36.992 --> 01:47:40.934
across this horribly gnarled skeletal face.

01:47:40.934 --> 01:47:41.728
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:47:41.728 --> 01:47:45.558
MATT: There stands this hideous-looking lich
cackling to itself.

01:47:45.558 --> 01:47:53.076
ORION: Ah, the ace of spades-- two of spades, it
changed, dammit. Looking at Pathfinder right now.

01:47:53.076 --> 01:47:54.248
(all laugh)

01:47:54.248 --> 01:47:57.460
ORION: Two of spades.

01:47:57.460 --> 01:47:59.355
LIAM: Tiberius, can we hit it and quit it?

01:47:59.355 --> 01:48:02.251
LAURA: What are the other ones?

01:48:02.251 --> 01:48:05.464
MATT: The other one (poof) and you see before you
a kind of --

01:48:05.464 --> 01:48:09.349
ORION: Flip them over, they have good graphics on
the cover.

01:48:09.349 --> 01:48:17.291
MATT: It's nice. Through the smoke, you see what
looks like some sort of a human kind of long,

01:48:17.291 --> 01:48:23.310
long-fighting warrior, grizzled, ready to fight,
has a big old longsword out, armored up in

01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:28.676
scalemail, one eye is kinda wounded, and he just
kinda sits there and growls with his blade ready.

01:48:28.676 --> 01:48:37.569
The third card. From the smoke appears a
red-skinned dragonborn with long blue robes and a

01:48:37.569 --> 01:48:38.961
staff with a glowing beam of light on it.

01:48:38.961 --> 01:48:39.950
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:48:39.950 --> 01:48:41.678
ORION: Oh. It must be a joker.

01:48:41.678 --> 01:48:45.862
MATT: You see an exact duplicate of Tiberius now
standing there as the three illusions stand.

01:48:45.862 --> 01:48:47.614
(all laugh)

01:48:47.614 --> 01:48:48.547
TRAVIS: Outstanding.

01:48:48.547 --> 01:48:49.312
MARISHA: That's perfect.

01:48:49.312 --> 01:48:50.678
MATT: Your cards are now spent, correct?

01:48:50.678 --> 01:48:53.499
ORION: Uh, no, they exist until I dispel them.

01:48:53.499 --> 01:48:55.963
MATT: Right, but I mean the actual cards don't go
back in the deck.

01:48:55.963 --> 01:48:56.684
ORION: Yes, they do.

01:48:56.684 --> 01:49:03.879
MATT: They do, okay. All right, never mind. Okay.
As you shout out, the card illusion appears. You

01:49:03.879 --> 01:49:12.757
see about five or six duergar kind of look out
from a nearby tent and go-- and then start running

01:49:12.757 --> 01:49:15.351
toward the center of the town.

01:49:15.351 --> 01:49:16.905
MARISHA: Come here, bitches

01:49:16.905 --> 01:49:23.955
MATT: About 20 seconds pass. And then you start
hearing this (boom boom boom boom). It sounds like

01:49:23.955 --> 01:49:24.897
a drum beat.

01:49:24.897 --> 01:49:25.988
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:49:25.988 --> 01:49:26.875
SAM: Cut the rope, cut the rope.

01:49:26.875 --> 01:49:28.294
LAURA: Not yet, not yet, not yet.

01:49:28.294 --> 01:49:29.937
SAM: Leave Vax there, let's go.

01:49:29.937 --> 01:49:31.284
(all laugh)

01:49:31.284 --> 01:49:37.939
MATT: At this point, you now see about 16 duergar
come running out from the center of town, armored,

01:49:37.939 --> 01:49:45.372
weapons drawn, a few with crossbows, two trolls
and an ogre charging out. You see the ogres

01:49:45.372 --> 01:49:50.271
holding this giant-- it looks like a stone slab
for one of its clubs, and the two trolls just come

01:49:50.271 --> 01:49:53.671
with their claws open, rushing right towards you
and the illusions.

01:49:53.671 --> 01:49:54.748
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

01:49:54.748 --> 01:49:56.758
LIAM: I start flipping--

01:49:56.758 --> 01:50:02.043
ORION: I command the lich to start doing one of
his glowy spells, and, like, through him, I go:

01:50:02.043 --> 01:50:05.109
(whispers) Come for us, your death awaits.

01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:06.461
(all laugh)

01:50:06.461 --> 01:50:07.348
MATT: All right.

01:50:07.348 --> 01:50:10.069
LIAM: And I flip the double birds and start
walking backwards a little bit.

01:50:10.069 --> 01:50:11.509
SAM: Oh yes, that's even better!

01:50:11.509 --> 01:50:12.614
MARISHA: Just watch your step!

01:50:12.614 --> 01:50:13.799
LIAM: Yes, straight back.

01:50:13.799 --> 01:50:14.972
ORION: I command the soldier to start swinging his
sword.

01:50:14.972 --> 01:50:19.091
MATT: As you're stepping back, four of the duergar
immediately take, using their inertia,

01:50:19.091 --> 01:50:21.446
pull and release javelins in your direction.

01:50:21.446 --> 01:50:22.215
LIAM: Okay.

01:50:22.215 --> 01:50:27.642
LAURA: Oh god!

01:50:27.642 --> 01:50:29.646
MATT: All right, what's your AC?

01:50:29.646 --> 01:50:30.537
LAURA: Oh gosh.

01:50:30.537 --> 01:50:33.080
LIAM: My AC is 19.

01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:35.425
MATT: All right, you take two javelins--

01:50:35.425 --> 01:50:38.271
LIAM: I'm gonna use Uncanny Dodge. For anything I
can see, I can dodge

01:50:38.271 --> 01:50:40.107
for half damage, if I need to.

01:50:40.107 --> 01:50:42.633
MATT: All right, good to know. The first one
strikes

01:50:42.633 --> 01:50:47.364
you in the torso for a total of 11 damage.

01:50:47.364 --> 01:50:49.051
LIAM: Shit, okay.

01:50:49.051 --> 01:50:50.066
ORION: Oh.

01:50:50.066 --> 01:50:53.287
MATT: The other hits you for a total of eight
damage.

01:50:53.287 --> 01:50:54.936
LIAM: Is that the halved or--?

01:50:54.936 --> 01:50:55.816
ORION: Total.

01:50:55.816 --> 01:50:57.757
MATT: No, well, you can choose to half one. It's
up to you, you choose which one.

01:50:57.757 --> 01:50:58.516
Probably the higher one.

01:50:58.516 --> 01:50:59.492
LIAM: Okay, so, it was 11 and eight?

01:50:59.492 --> 01:51:00.354
MATT: So it would be six.

01:51:00.354 --> 01:51:01.746
LIAM: Okay, six and eight, okay, 14.

01:51:01.746 --> 01:51:04.172
MATT: 14 points of damage with these just javelins
hitting you like, oh, that's right.

01:51:04.172 --> 01:51:05.536
They have range!

01:51:05.536 --> 01:51:06.920
(all laugh)

01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:08.978
LIAM: Right, I knew this was coming.

01:51:08.978 --> 01:51:09.690
LAURA: Right!

01:51:09.690 --> 01:51:11.359
MATT: You can immediately see one of the trolls
goes and just lunges forward and slashes the lich,

01:51:11.359 --> 01:51:12.808
just passing through its form.

01:51:12.808 --> 01:51:13.654
ORION: He lunges at the lich?

01:51:13.654 --> 01:51:14.382
MATT: Yeah.

01:51:14.382 --> 01:51:16.045
ORION: Sweet!

01:51:16.045 --> 01:51:19.505
MATT: It went through, it kinda loses its footing
for a second, stops and kinda looks angry,

01:51:19.505 --> 01:51:20.860
turns and starts slashing at it again.

01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:21.880
LAURA: Run! Run away!

01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:22.752
SAM: -- fake ground.

01:51:22.752 --> 01:51:23.735
ORION: And I'm like--

01:51:23.735 --> 01:51:24.988
MARISHA: Yeah, isn't he on the fake ground? The
lich?

01:51:24.988 --> 01:51:25.855
ORION: Yes, yeah, he's like right at the edge.

01:51:25.855 --> 01:51:26.851
MATT: Yeah, right at the precipice.

01:51:26.851 --> 01:51:29.232
ORION: I can't throw my card on the fake ground.
They'd fall.

01:51:29.232 --> 01:51:30.870
MATT: Yeah, so the troll kind of steps forward--

01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:32.387
ORION: They're right at the edge, though.

01:51:32.387 --> 01:51:35.107
MATT: -- and the troll turns around and starts
slashing. The other one goes right for the

01:51:35.107 --> 01:51:40.528
veteran. And (laughs) goes running right off the
edge.

01:51:40.528 --> 01:51:41.463
LAURA: (gasps)

01:51:41.463 --> 01:51:42.489
ALL: Yes!

01:51:42.489 --> 01:51:43.319
SAM: The troll?

01:51:43.319 --> 01:51:47.513
MATT: That was the troll, just (falling sounds).
The ogre goes running forward, right towards you.

01:51:47.513 --> 01:51:48.359
ORION: I command the--

01:51:48.359 --> 01:51:49.289
LIAM: Yes?

01:51:49.289 --> 01:51:52.053
MATT: Just their speed, they're just the first
ones to get there. Duergar have tiny legs.

01:51:52.053 --> 01:51:54.982
LIAM: (high-pitched voice) Where's the roll for
initiative, man?

01:51:54.982 --> 01:51:56.150
LAURA: You're already back, you're at the bridge!

01:51:56.150 --> 01:51:58.054
MATT: This is what I'm saying, what are you doing?
This is your reactionary part. We're just taking--

01:51:58.054 --> 01:51:59.437
this isn't a battle, this is--

01:51:59.437 --> 01:52:01.762
LIAM: Yeah, I'm backing it up, I'm running, man.

01:52:01.762 --> 01:52:08.960
MATT: All right, so you go charging back onto the
bridge. As you go running, all right, both trolls

01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:10.865
and the ogre have just gone off the side.

01:52:10.865 --> 01:52:11.705
LAURA: Badass!

01:52:11.705 --> 01:52:12.989
(all cheer)

01:52:12.989 --> 01:52:14.728
MATT: You hear them screaming as they tumble into
the darkness.

01:52:14.728 --> 01:52:16.609
LIAM: I'm laughing as I run.

01:52:16.609 --> 01:52:18.238
TRAVIS: Didn't occur to me that there is a
bridge--

01:52:18.238 --> 01:52:24.025
MATT: About four duergar also go spilling over the
side, screaming as they tumble into the darkness.

01:52:24.025 --> 01:52:24.963
TRAVIS: Yes!

01:52:24.963 --> 01:52:26.634
MATT: The rest of them stop, kind of look around
and--

01:52:26.634 --> 01:52:27.926
SAM: This was a great plan!

01:52:27.926 --> 01:52:32.212
ORION: I start-- as that's happening, I start to
pull back and float away and I'm commanding all of

01:52:32.212 --> 01:52:35.573
my guys to come through the bridge. Because I can
command them within 30 feet. So they're now,

01:52:35.573 --> 01:52:38.343
they're all within 30 feet of me, retreating as
well.

01:52:38.343 --> 01:52:43.516
MATT: Okay. As this is happening, you can now see
some of the members of the duergar that are now at

01:52:43.516 --> 01:52:48.580
the edge are some of the elite guard, with the
blackened armor you saw. They both kinda step

01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:53.885
forward and put their foot out, feeling for
purchase, give a nod, pull out their swords, and

01:52:53.885 --> 01:52:55.367
start hacking at the bridge immediately.

01:52:55.367 --> 01:52:56.494
SAM: (gasps) Oh shit.

01:52:56.494 --> 01:52:57.534
LAURA: Shit.

01:52:57.534 --> 01:52:58.751
TALIESIN: All right, I'm taking a shot.

01:52:58.751 --> 01:53:01.263
LAURA: Can we-- does our aim reach? Our ranged
attacks, do they reach?

01:53:01.263 --> 01:53:02.319
SAM: (whispers) You, fly?

01:53:02.319 --> 01:53:03.417
TRAVIS: No, he's got it.

01:53:03.417 --> 01:53:05.470
LAURA: Do ranged attacks reach?

01:53:05.491 --> 01:53:08.111
MATT: From this distance, it's gonna be a serious
penalty.

01:53:08.111 --> 01:53:08.781
TALIESIN: I'm not!

01:53:08.781 --> 01:53:09.709
MATT: You don't, because you--

01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:11.781
TALIESIN: I'm taking that shot, because I can
shoot forever.

01:53:11.781 --> 01:53:12.917
MATT: Go for it.

01:53:12.917 --> 01:53:14.311
ORION: (gunshot)

01:53:14.311 --> 01:53:15.864
LIAM: I'm untying the carpet quickly.

01:53:15.864 --> 01:53:17.448
(all laugh)

01:53:17.448 --> 01:53:20.752
TALIESIN: Oh, for the love of god and all that is
holy.

01:53:20.752 --> 01:53:21.969
MARISHA: (groans) Oh, no.

01:53:21.969 --> 01:53:24.097
TALIESIN: Misfire, I gotta--

01:53:24.097 --> 01:53:25.487
LAURA: I can at least try, right?

01:53:25.487 --> 01:53:28.211
MATT: Go ahead and roll. As you-- You're at
disadvantage.

01:53:28.211 --> 01:53:31.685
LAURA: Fail so hard.

01:53:31.685 --> 01:53:35.769
MATT: As your arrow (shooting sound) off, you (gun
misfiring sound) and there's a slight delay, and

01:53:35.769 --> 01:53:40.667
you wonder, why isn't it working? And this
horrible explosion sound bursts out as you can now

01:53:40.667 --> 01:53:44.397
see, black and red smoke pouring out of the front
of the barrel of Bad News, and it burns your hands

01:53:44.397 --> 01:53:46.365
for a second and you're like, ah, shit, take a
second to--

01:53:46.365 --> 01:53:47.792
TALIESIN: All right, so I gotta stop and clean.

01:53:47.792 --> 01:53:50.963
MATT: Yeah, however, because you are unable to
halt that,

01:53:50.963 --> 01:53:54.058
both of those duergar take shots at the bridge.

01:53:54.058 --> 01:53:56.148
TALIESIN: Damn it.

01:53:56.219 --> 01:53:58.120
MATT: Both hit with their swords.

01:53:58.120 --> 01:53:59.541
MARISHA: Are you on the carpet, Vax?

01:53:59.541 --> 01:54:00.590
TRAVIS: He's getting it out.

01:54:00.590 --> 01:54:01.507
LIAM: I don't know, I said I was.

01:54:01.507 --> 01:54:02.812
LAURA: Get on it, now.

01:54:02.881 --> 01:54:03.936
MATT: As you're running and pulling the carpet
out--

01:54:03.936 --> 01:54:04.682
LIAM: Yes!

01:54:04.682 --> 01:54:05.888
MATT: -- the bridge is cut clean--

01:54:05.888 --> 01:54:06.567
LAURA: (gasps)

01:54:06.567 --> 01:54:07.294
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

01:54:07.294 --> 01:54:08.569
MATT: -- and begins to fall out from under you.

01:54:08.569 --> 01:54:09.349
LIAM: Okay.

01:54:09.349 --> 01:54:10.442
MATT: You go pulling out the--

01:54:10.442 --> 01:54:11.260
LIAM: Acrobatics check?

01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:12.321
MARISHA: Use them dex saves!

01:54:12.321 --> 01:54:13.664
MATT: This is gonna go ahead and be a dex check
now.

01:54:13.664 --> 01:54:14.831
MARISHA: You've got advantage!

01:54:14.831 --> 01:54:15.508
MATT: You do.

01:54:15.508 --> 01:54:16.241
LAURA: Oh, good.

01:54:16.241 --> 01:54:19.533
LIAM: Okay, good, because the first roll was a
one. The second roll was a 19.

01:54:19.533 --> 01:54:20.867
ORION: Yes!

01:54:20.867 --> 01:54:23.422
LIAM: Plus! Plus, plus, plus nine is 28.

01:54:23.422 --> 01:54:27.433
TRAVIS: Oh my god! You almost died!

01:54:27.433 --> 01:54:33.465
MATT: All right. You pull out the carpet. As
you're going to set it down, as you feel the

01:54:33.465 --> 01:54:37.497
bridge beginning to like, give out from under you,
you feel this creepy sensation

01:54:37.497 --> 01:54:38.984
pushing towards the back of your head.

01:54:38.984 --> 01:54:39.789
LAURA: Oh no!

01:54:39.789 --> 01:54:40.705
LIAM: Mm-hm.

01:54:40.705 --> 01:54:44.044
MATT: You guys, looking across, you can see now a
familiar cloaked figure has emerged.

01:54:44.044 --> 01:54:45.274
(all gasp)

01:54:45.274 --> 01:54:46.161
SAM: Oh shit!

01:54:46.161 --> 01:54:46.916
LIAM: I drew him out.

01:54:46.916 --> 01:54:47.885
LAURA: Clean your gun, clean your gun!

01:54:47.885 --> 01:54:48.745
TALIESIN: I'm cleaning my gun.

01:54:48.745 --> 01:54:50.295
MATT: Go ahead and make a willpower saving throw.

01:54:50.295 --> 01:54:51.273
TRAVIS: Get your bow ready.

01:54:51.273 --> 01:54:52.544
LAURA: I am, I'm ready, it's too far!

01:54:52.544 --> 01:54:55.914
LIAM: I survive a free fall and you hit me with
that right after? Yeah, will save?

01:54:55.914 --> 01:54:56.958
MATT: Willpower save.

01:54:56.958 --> 01:54:59.171
LIAM: So that's-- what is it, I've never done
that? That's--

01:54:59.171 --> 01:55:04.041
MATT: It's at the top of your sheet of your stats,
above your stats, on the right of your stats. Oh,

01:55:04.041 --> 01:55:06.357
it's your wisdom saving.

01:55:06.357 --> 01:55:07.695
LIAM: Wisdom, okay.

01:55:07.695 --> 01:55:08.624
MATT: Wisdom.

01:55:08.624 --> 01:55:12.185
LIAM: Ow, not very good. Seven.

01:55:12.185 --> 01:55:13.062
MATT: Seven.

01:55:13.062 --> 01:55:14.839
LAURA: No!

01:55:14.839 --> 01:55:24.844
MATT: As you are running, you get the carpet out,
you leap onto it and your whole sense and awareness

01:55:24.979 --> 01:55:27.538
of your surroundings just fades from you. You just
feel your entire body going numb for a second and

01:55:27.604 --> 01:55:30.579
you just feel yourself falling.

01:55:30.579 --> 01:55:31.894
MARISHA: Holy shit.

01:55:31.894 --> 01:55:32.929
LAURA: Fly down! Get him! Get him!

01:55:32.929 --> 01:55:33.947
MATT: Falling back.

01:55:33.947 --> 01:55:35.132
ORION: Oh! Oh bother! Shoo! I go get him!

01:55:35.132 --> 01:55:37.791
LIAM: 29 dex save right down the toilet.

01:55:37.791 --> 01:55:39.624
MATT: You go and swoop down, fly. You manage to--

01:55:39.624 --> 01:55:40.883
ORION: Is he conscious?

01:55:40.883 --> 01:55:43.280
MATT: He is just staring up at this moment.

01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:46.778
ORION: Very good. I go just to touch him, I am not
trying to pull him up.

01:55:46.778 --> 01:55:48.099
MATT: Okay.

01:55:48.192 --> 01:55:49.344
LAURA: What? Try to grab him! Try to grab him!

01:55:49.344 --> 01:55:50.294
LIAM: Fly, he can fly me.

01:55:50.294 --> 01:55:51.063
SAM : He is falling!

01:55:51.063 --> 01:55:51.861
ORION: He is falling. Fly!

01:55:51.861 --> 01:55:52.734
LIAM: Like Superman.

01:55:52.734 --> 01:55:53.806
MATT: You cast Fly on him? All right!

01:55:53.806 --> 01:55:55.155
ORION: Now fly, damn it.

01:55:55.155 --> 01:55:59.735
MATT: He is still just kind of standing there, not
doing anything. As you finish casting the Fly

01:55:59.735 --> 01:56:02.678
spell, your Fly spell dissipates because it's a
concentration spell

01:56:02.678 --> 01:56:04.459
and you can have one at a given time.

01:56:04.459 --> 01:56:05.928
ORION: Wait, you're unconscious?

01:56:05.928 --> 01:56:07.002
LIAM: I don't know what I am.

01:56:07.002 --> 01:56:07.880
ORION: I ask right now, is he--

01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:08.997
MARISHA: He's like catatonic.

01:56:08.997 --> 01:56:11.716
ORION: He is, okay. Then I don't do that, because
you can't fly yourself,

01:56:11.716 --> 01:56:15.164
so I do grab him, this time.

01:56:15.221 --> 01:56:19.940
MATT: Okay, you grab him as his whole weight goes
onto you. What's your strength?

01:56:19.997 --> 01:56:21.837
ORION: Oh my god.

01:56:21.837 --> 01:56:22.928
LIAM: It has been nice knowing you, ladies and
gentlemen.

01:56:22.928 --> 01:56:23.727
ORION: 12.

01:56:23.727 --> 01:56:24.704
LAURA: No, no, no.

01:56:24.704 --> 01:56:28.019
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check.

01:56:28.019 --> 01:56:29.747
MARISHA: Come on, Tiberius.

01:56:29.747 --> 01:56:31.584
LAURA: Can we see this all happening off to the
side?

01:56:31.584 --> 01:56:33.495
SAM: Plus eight.

01:56:33.495 --> 01:56:34.324
LAURA: Keyleth!

01:56:34.324 --> 01:56:35.211
TALIESIN: It's happening very fast.

01:56:35.211 --> 01:56:36.138
LIAM: Oh, shit, can I use--

01:56:36.138 --> 01:56:40.149
ORION: It's a 21.

01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:47.918
MATT: 21? You rush down, diving, you grab the back
of his armor. As you yank up on him, you manage to

01:56:47.918 --> 01:56:53.187
just pull him across and get him to the other
edge. The flying carpet, however, has plummeted

01:56:53.187 --> 01:56:54.153
down in--

01:56:54.153 --> 01:56:55.610
ALL: No!

01:56:55.610 --> 01:56:56.740
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

01:56:56.740 --> 01:56:59.595
LAURA: You lost our flying carpet, you
unconscious bastard!

01:56:59.595 --> 01:57:05.886
MATT: However, Tiberius swoops up. You guys just
see them both plummet into darkness and then

01:57:05.886 --> 01:57:10.979
flying up at the edge of the crevasse on your
side, Tiberius clutching your brother, currently

01:57:10.979 --> 01:57:13.892
just staring off into space and dropping him down
with a dull sound.

01:57:13.892 --> 01:57:15.858
LAURA: Vax!

01:57:15.858 --> 01:57:19.290
MATT: The bridge slaps onto the side of the
cavern.

01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:20.761
LIAM: Mawp.

01:57:20.761 --> 01:57:22.648
LAURA: And I run over to Vax.

01:57:22.648 --> 01:57:23.390
LIAM: Mawp.

01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:25.832
LAURA: And I'm like trying to figure out what's
wrong with him.

01:57:25.832 --> 01:57:27.417
TRAVIS: The magic carpet is done?

01:57:27.417 --> 01:57:28.836
MATT: It just disappeared into the darkness
below.

01:57:28.909 --> 01:57:29.932
LAURA: Oh no!

01:57:29.932 --> 01:57:32.278
TRAVIS: (tearfully) I have to erase it.

01:57:32.278 --> 01:57:33.038
MARISHA: Bye, carpet.

01:57:33.038 --> 01:57:33.940
TALIESIN: No.

01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:35.185
SAM: That was our ticket across the chasm.

01:57:35.242 --> 01:57:36.076
LIAM: Yes.

01:57:36.076 --> 01:57:39.199
MARISHA: I loved that carpet, damn it.

01:57:39.199 --> 01:57:41.818
MATT: About a minute passes or so, you come back
to your senses.

01:57:41.818 --> 01:57:43.635
LAURA: Oh, good.

01:57:43.635 --> 01:57:45.801
LIAM: I got to get the carpet.

01:57:45.801 --> 01:57:47.364
(all laugh)

01:57:47.364 --> 01:57:48.476
TALIESIN: Can I clean my gun?

01:57:48.476 --> 01:57:49.858
ORION: I slap him with Mage Hand. Snap out of
it!

01:57:49.858 --> 01:57:51.020
LIAM: What happened? What happened?

01:57:51.020 --> 01:57:51.957
TRAVIS: Wait, do we leave or--

01:57:51.957 --> 01:57:52.949
LAURA: No, wait--

01:57:52.949 --> 01:57:54.671
TALIESIN: They are still across there, aren't
they?

01:57:54.671 --> 01:57:57.826
MATT: You can see across the way that there are a
bunch of them just standing at the edge.

01:57:57.826 --> 01:57:59.684
TALIESIN: I wanna take a shot at the--

01:57:59.684 --> 01:58:00.680
LAURA: At the--

01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:02.419
LIAM: Noodle-face, yeah.

01:58:02.479 --> 01:58:04.712
MATT: Okay, go for it.

01:58:04.712 --> 01:58:06.231
LAURA: Oh, man!

01:58:06.231 --> 01:58:08.292
SAM: You can see them and they control you.

01:58:08.292 --> 01:58:09.274
LAURA: Right in the noggin.

01:58:09.274 --> 01:58:10.224
LIAM: Shoot it in the eye, man.

01:58:10.224 --> 01:58:14.086
ORION: Not from that distance, I don't think. His
sniper rifle goes far.

01:58:14.086 --> 01:58:16.029
TALIESIN: Hm, that's a 23.

01:58:16.029 --> 01:58:28.607
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll the damage. Across
the way you can hear the resounding (gunshot).

01:58:28.607 --> 01:58:33.418
TALIESIN: Ah, yeah! That don't suck! 20 points of
damage.

01:58:33.418 --> 01:58:42.896
MATT: 20 points of damage! Nice. You just see
this blast of red and flame across the way and

01:58:42.896 --> 01:58:45.608
the figure is just knocked off its feet, about ten
feet back.

01:58:45.841 --> 01:58:51.018
(all laugh)

01:58:51.018 --> 01:58:52.455
LAURA: Can you shoot him again?

01:58:52.455 --> 01:58:54.138
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:58:54.138 --> 01:58:56.680
MARISHA: It's just a carnival game for Percy at
this point.

01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:59.051
MATT: At this point in time you can now see the
duergar looking up

01:58:59.051 --> 01:59:01.567
and backing away from the cliff side.

01:59:01.567 --> 01:59:03.721
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:59:03.721 --> 01:59:06.638
MATT: You come to the bridge, which is just
dangling off the side now.

01:59:06.638 --> 01:59:09.125
LIAM: We're on the goblin side, now?

01:59:09.125 --> 01:59:10.143
LAURA: Yeah.

01:59:10.143 --> 01:59:11.751
MATT: You're on the goblin side and the bridge is
just dangling down into darkness.

01:59:11.751 --> 01:59:13.170
TALIESIN: That felt pretty good, too.

01:59:13.170 --> 01:59:17.809
LIAM: Who wants to have a picnic?

01:59:17.809 --> 01:59:19.579
ORION: I mean, seriously.

01:59:19.579 --> 01:59:21.219
MARISHA: So how many (monster sounds) are over
there ?

01:59:21.292 --> 01:59:22.597
MATT: You only saw the one.

01:59:22.597 --> 01:59:24.657
MARISHA: And how many duergar left? How many--

01:59:24.657 --> 01:59:25.884
ORION: Yes, how many are left after all that?

01:59:25.884 --> 01:59:26.807
MARISHA: After they fell into--

01:59:26.807 --> 01:59:30.303
MATT: After all that, you saw a few more kind of
filter out from the town, you have probably about

01:59:30.303 --> 01:59:33.358
25 visible at that moment that have all backed.

01:59:33.358 --> 01:59:37.279
TALIESIN: I'm going to hang on him visually and
I'm gonna wait to take another shot

01:59:37.279 --> 01:59:39.358
until he tries to stand up again.

01:59:39.358 --> 01:59:40.271
MATT: Okay.

01:59:40.271 --> 01:59:43.089
TALIESIN: So if he tries to stand up again, I want
to shoot him again.

01:59:43.089 --> 01:59:45.691
LAURA: But wait, you can shoot him while he's on
the ground! Can't you?

01:59:45.691 --> 01:59:47.942
TALIESIN: That's so much more fun to wait.

01:59:47.942 --> 01:59:50.035
MATT: You can shoot him, but it's at disadvantage
to shoot someone who's prone.

01:59:50.035 --> 01:59:50.776
LAURA: He's on the ground?

01:59:50.776 --> 01:59:51.717
MATT: Yeah.

01:59:51.717 --> 01:59:54.228
TALIESIN: Technically, he's got cover. And it's
funnier to just wait.

01:59:54.228 --> 01:59:57.165
MATT: A moment passes and he kind of drifts back
up. Take another shot.

01:59:57.165 --> 01:59:58.441
TALIESIN: Taking another shot.

01:59:58.441 --> 01:59:59.388
MARISHA: Come on, Percy.

01:59:59.388 --> 02:00:00.233
LIAM: Come on, baby.

02:00:00.233 --> 02:00:01.258
TALIESIN: He's such an asshole.

02:00:01.258 --> 02:00:02.402
MARISHA: Like fish in a barrel.

02:00:02.402 --> 02:00:03.403
LIAM: Come on, Von Rolo!

02:00:03.403 --> 02:00:05.242
TALIESIN: 15.

02:00:05.242 --> 02:00:08.175
MATT: 15? Unfortunately, it does not hit.

02:00:08.175 --> 02:00:11.059
LIAM: (ricochet noise)

02:00:11.059 --> 02:00:14.891
MATT: At that distance, with the darkness, it's
very hard to get your bead on him at that point.

02:00:14.891 --> 02:00:17.501
So you (gunshot), fires off, you can now see it
drift away--

02:00:17.501 --> 02:00:18.429
LAURA: Fudge!

02:00:18.429 --> 02:00:20.542
MATT: -- and all the rest of the duergar are now
retreating into the city.

02:00:20.542 --> 02:00:22.439
TALIESIN: Man!

02:00:22.439 --> 02:00:27.982
LAURA: What're you gonna do? All of our shit's
gone.

02:00:27.982 --> 02:00:28.899
MARISHA: Okay.

02:00:28.899 --> 02:00:30.038
TRAVIS: Okay. What're we gonna do? Leave?

02:00:30.038 --> 02:00:31.080
LAURA: Maybe we can-- can we walk up and see--

02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:31.929
ORION: Let's take a short rest.

02:00:31.929 --> 02:00:33.099
LAURA: -- if we can find another bridge?

02:00:33.099 --> 02:00:34.171
ORION: While we're figuring this out.

02:00:34.171 --> 02:00:36.163
MATT: If you want to. Okay. So you walk over to
the edge, and you kind of look across to the

02:00:36.163 --> 02:00:38.718
sides. Make a perception check.

02:00:38.718 --> 02:00:40.130
TALIESIN: I'll assist.

02:00:40.130 --> 02:00:40.884
LAURA: Oh, 20!

02:00:40.884 --> 02:00:41.603
LIAM: 20.

02:00:41.603 --> 02:00:42.408
TALIESIN: Never mind!

02:00:42.408 --> 02:00:43.270
LAURA: No, no assistance needed.

02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:44.050
MATT: Natural 20?

02:00:44.050 --> 02:00:44.716
LIAM: Yeah.

02:00:44.716 --> 02:00:45.436
TALIESIN: Never mind.

02:00:45.436 --> 02:00:46.239
MATT: Natural 20.

02:00:46.239 --> 02:00:46.912
LAURA &amp;amp; LIAM: Yes.

02:00:46.912 --> 02:00:47.514
MATT: Plus--

02:00:47.514 --> 02:00:48.232
LAURA: Plus my perception?

02:00:48.232 --> 02:00:49.108
LIAM: (high-pitched) Natural 20 motherfucker!

02:00:49.108 --> 02:00:50.016
LAURA: My perception is six.

02:00:50.016 --> 02:00:50.902
LIAM: (high-pitched) Automatic win!

02:00:50.902 --> 02:00:51.720
MATT: You glance over the side--

02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:52.489
(all laugh)

02:00:52.489 --> 02:00:54.980
MATT: -- and looking down, you can see the bridge
is just kind of like drifting from the air that's

02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:58.100
flowing, and you can just see the-- and it's not
like the whole bottom floor is all lava, there's

02:00:58.100 --> 02:01:04.036
just streaks of it pouring down from whatever the
interior of this lower chasm is. You see, at the

02:01:04.036 --> 02:01:07.832
edge of the rope break, which goes down for a good
150, 200 feet or so, dangling,

02:01:07.832 --> 02:01:10.979
and there's a tiny little flicker of material--

02:01:10.979 --> 02:01:12.242
LAURA: (gasps)

02:01:12.242 --> 02:01:14.189
MATT: -- wrapped up in the ropes of the rope
bridge.

02:01:14.189 --> 02:01:15.041
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:01:15.041 --> 02:01:15.833
TRAVIS: It's the carpet!

02:01:15.833 --> 02:01:16.564
SAM: Material? It's the carpet!

02:01:16.564 --> 02:01:18.545
MATT: It's the carpet! It seems to be the carpet.

02:01:18.545 --> 02:01:19.475
TALIESIN: Okay. We have an infinite rope!

02:01:19.475 --> 02:01:20.285
MARISHA: Oh! Go!

02:01:20.285 --> 02:01:21.374
LAURA: We have infinite rope! I'm gonna tie it to
myself--

02:01:21.374 --> 02:01:22.105
ORION: Wait, hold on a second--

02:01:22.105 --> 02:01:22.865
TALIESIN: We're gonna lower you down.

02:01:22.865 --> 02:01:25.442
ORION: Is it still-- it's just at the end of the--
all the way down there?

02:01:25.442 --> 02:01:26.721
MATT: Mm-hm.

02:01:26.721 --> 02:01:27.613
ORION: So I fly down there--

02:01:27.613 --> 02:01:28.370
LAURA: No-- aww.

02:01:28.370 --> 02:01:29.174
ORION: -- and go get it!

02:01:29.174 --> 02:01:30.051
SAM: Yeah, that makes sense.

02:01:30.051 --> 02:01:31.015
LAURA: Oh, all right.

02:01:31.015 --> 02:01:32.022
ORION: It's still in effect!

02:01:32.022 --> 02:01:32.696
MATT: Mm-hm.

02:01:32.696 --> 02:01:33.754
SAM: Okay, watch out for that warm air, whatever
that was.

02:01:33.754 --> 02:01:34.525
MATT: So.

02:01:34.525 --> 02:01:37.798
ORION: Ooh. You're right. I take out an empty
bottle while I do this.

02:01:37.798 --> 02:01:48.982
MATT: All right. You glide down along the base of
the cut rope bridge, and there, just barely

02:01:48.982 --> 02:01:52.621
hanging on by just haphazardly falling and
tangling itself in the ropes is the

02:01:52.621 --> 02:01:56.796
flying carpet. As you float down, you now get a
little bit of a better view, as your staff is lit,

02:01:56.870 --> 02:02:06.262
you can see, about another 150 feet down below
you, a little bit of a reflection of your light.

02:02:06.262 --> 02:02:08.962
It's currently just kind of rippling and
shifting.

02:02:08.962 --> 02:02:10.345
LAURA: (gasps) It's water down there?

02:02:10.345 --> 02:02:11.519
MARISHA and SAM: It's water?

02:02:11.519 --> 02:02:15.252
MATT: It appears to be some sort of water surface
below you. About 150 feet down.

02:02:15.252 --> 02:02:16.270
SAM: I thought there was lava--

02:02:16.270 --> 02:02:17.608
TRAVIS: I run and jump off the cliff!

02:02:17.608 --> 02:02:18.426
MATT: There are streaks of lava--

02:02:18.426 --> 02:02:19.311
LAURA: No you don't.

02:02:19.311 --> 02:02:20.390
MATT: -- pouring, like from the ceiling and
portions of the wall--

02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:21.369
TRAVIS: Yep, and I jumped all the way down.

02:02:21.369 --> 02:02:22.334
LAURA: It's 1000 feet down.

02:02:22.334 --> 02:02:23.610
MATT: -- but it's all just kind of pouring down
and pooling at the edges and then cooling.

02:02:23.610 --> 02:02:24.748
LAURA: It's 1000 feet.

02:02:24.748 --> 02:02:25.707
LIAM: That's a big belly flop.

02:02:25.707 --> 02:02:26.879
TRAVIS: I have great form in mid-air.

02:02:26.879 --> 02:02:27.908
SAM: So there, it's a river--

02:02:27.908 --> 02:02:28.963
ORION: And you don't know this yet.

02:02:28.963 --> 02:02:29.905
LAURA: Do you want to die?

02:02:29.905 --> 02:02:31.104
MATT: And you can see the waterfall, it's
cascading over the side--

02:02:31.104 --> 02:02:32.203
TRAVIS: It's water.

02:02:32.203 --> 02:02:33.879
LAURA: You're being incredibly childish. Don't do
that.

02:02:33.879 --> 02:02:35.459
MATT: -- is currently rushing past you at about 30
feet to your right, and it seems to be splashing

02:02:35.459 --> 02:02:36.625
into this pool below.

02:02:36.625 --> 02:02:38.740
LAURA: Don't. Dive. 1000 fucking feet.

02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:39.833
ORION: Waterfall. Ah!

02:02:39.833 --> 02:02:41.789
I retrieve the magic carpet.

02:02:41.860 --> 02:02:44.309
MATT: You grab the magic carpet, you roll it up,
make your way back up to the surface.

02:02:44.309 --> 02:02:46.062
MARISHA: Carpet!

02:02:46.062 --> 02:02:53.296
ORION: Ah, here you are. By the way, cool stuff
down there. It's actually not lava, it's water!

02:02:53.296 --> 02:02:54.938
Aha. Believe it or not.

02:02:54.938 --> 02:02:56.548
LAURA: Water? How far down from the bridge?

02:02:56.548 --> 02:03:02.409
ORION: It's about 150 feet from the bridge, but
it's about 1000 feet down all the way. We could

02:03:02.409 --> 02:03:08.085
traverse down, somehow, and I think it would be a
nice place to go explore.

02:03:08.085 --> 02:03:09.610
SAM: Place to go explore?

02:03:09.610 --> 02:03:11.244
ORION: Especially because we have nothing else to
do, and--

02:03:11.244 --> 02:03:13.593
SAM: Well, we could go to the camp and go kick
some--

02:03:13.593 --> 02:03:16.172
LAURA: Well, look, we know-- we can't get over
there.

02:03:16.229 --> 02:03:17.561
SAM: But we have a carpet now!

02:03:17.561 --> 02:03:18.341
ORION: Oh, that's right.

02:03:18.341 --> 02:03:19.016
LAURA: Oh.

02:03:19.016 --> 02:03:20.137
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we go over one at a time and
then we're waiting for--

02:03:20.137 --> 02:03:20.966
MARISHA: Ah, fly me down with you.

02:03:20.966 --> 02:03:21.803
LAURA: The thing is--

02:03:21.803 --> 02:03:22.724
SAM: The three of us can fly.

02:03:22.724 --> 02:03:24.136
MARISHA: Tiberius and I are going to fly down.

02:03:24.136 --> 02:03:24.890
LAURA: The thing is, we know that--

02:03:24.890 --> 02:03:25.567
MARISHA: On the carpet.

02:03:25.567 --> 02:03:26.667
LAURA: -- deeper down is where they've gone.

02:03:26.667 --> 02:03:27.851
MARISHA: Yes. That's true.

02:03:27.851 --> 02:03:32.100
LAURA: So probably it'd be best to go down. We
could have avoided all of this bullshit if we'd

02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:33.276
just have known--

02:03:33.276 --> 02:03:34.403
LIAM: But we didn't know, and if there's--

02:03:34.403 --> 02:03:35.601
MARISHA: I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna fight
that guy.

02:03:35.601 --> 02:03:37.194
LIAM: -- if there's more than one of them these,
though, he's gone boodle-oodle-ooo to his friends

02:03:37.194 --> 02:03:38.468
right now, I mean--

02:03:38.468 --> 02:03:39.389
LAURA: Right.

02:03:39.389 --> 02:03:42.474
LIAM: -- if we can it'd be good to put this guy in
the ground.

02:03:42.474 --> 02:03:43.350
SAM: I'm all for going--

02:03:43.350 --> 02:03:45.260
MARISHA: I don't know. Okay, take me down--

02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:46.540
SAM: There's a tunnel back there--

02:03:46.540 --> 02:03:47.858
MARISHA: Hang on, let me, let's go see, let's go
see.

02:03:47.858 --> 02:03:49.248
SAM: -- back, past that village, that they're
protecting.

02:03:49.248 --> 02:03:50.809
ORION: Well, I'm still flying, you can take--
Percy, would you like to come?

02:03:50.809 --> 02:03:51.898
TALIESIN: Oh, all right.

02:03:51.898 --> 02:03:56.159
MARISHA: I've-- to ride the carpet down to the
bottom with Percy and Tiberius.

02:03:56.159 --> 02:04:00.893
ORION: Well, I-- whoever's going down should be on
the carpet, 'cause I can still fly.

02:04:00.893 --> 02:04:01.618
MARISHA: Right.

02:04:01.618 --> 02:04:02.660
ORION: So, I don't need it.

02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:03.715
MARISHA: Me and Percy are on the carpet.

02:04:03.715 --> 02:04:05.544
MATT: All right, so the two of you get on the
carpet, you drift down, and you begin to make your

02:04:05.544 --> 02:04:09.423
way down this giant crevasse. As you get down, the
air gets warmer and warmer, and you begin to see

02:04:09.423 --> 02:04:14.894
as you come down, a good 600 feet now at this
point, into this much larger space than the one

02:04:14.894 --> 02:04:21.543
you guys are currently above. It's like a giant,
triangular, open cavern down here. It kind of

02:04:21.543 --> 02:04:23.739
funnels up into where the bridge was.

02:04:23.739 --> 02:04:29.017
MARISHA: Do I see any tunnels, or areas that look
like it leads someplace of interest?

02:04:29.017 --> 02:04:33.867
MATT: As you look down, there is definitely a
large pool of water that leads off into a few

02:04:33.867 --> 02:04:41.175
other underground rivers that spill off into the
mountainside itself. There are sections of the

02:04:41.175 --> 02:04:45.056
wall where lava is pouring out, where there seems
to be some sort of a vent or some sort of opening

02:04:45.056 --> 02:04:49.519
into some magma reserve, and there are about three
of them that are pouring out, and kind of drifting

02:04:49.519 --> 02:04:54.348
down. One of them is pooling and cooling as it
hits the water, and it's just kind of this

02:04:54.348 --> 02:05:01.255
perpetually glowing mass of slow-growing rock.
There also appears to be one that is just

02:05:01.328 --> 02:05:05.548
continuing to flow that leads, kind of, back in
the direction where you guys came, but underneath.

02:05:05.548 --> 02:05:09.730
There's one big lava pool that is spilling, and
then kind of giving a little bit of light to the

02:05:09.730 --> 02:05:14.710
inside of a tunnel that continues further down at
a decline. The opposite side--

02:05:14.710 --> 02:05:16.190
SAM: Lava tunnels? What, are you crazy?

02:05:16.190 --> 02:05:17.730
MARISHA: I keep going.

02:05:17.730 --> 02:05:18.843
SAM: Sorry, yes?

02:05:18.843 --> 02:05:19.711
MATT: That's okay.

02:05:19.711 --> 02:05:20.506
MARISHA: Are you done?

02:05:20.506 --> 02:05:23.713
MATT: On the opposite side, you can see there's a
small outcropping and a smaller waterfall that is

02:05:23.713 --> 02:05:29.169
pouring out of the side of the mountain, like
another sea is now meeting the river underneath,

02:05:29.169 --> 02:05:34.435
and that is just kind of cascading out from the
side of the rock, dropping about 30 or 40 feet,

02:05:34.435 --> 02:05:36.134
and hitting the edge of the rock pool.

02:05:36.134 --> 02:05:37.003
MARISHA: Okay.

02:05:37.003 --> 02:05:37.876
LIAM: On Cthulhu's side, you're talking about?

02:05:37.876 --> 02:05:39.493
MATT: On Cthulhu's side. Yeah.

02:05:39.493 --> 02:05:41.391
ORION: I think we should--

02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:44.775
MARISHA: I say, Tiberius, give me some light?

02:05:44.775 --> 02:05:45.992
ORION: Oh!

02:05:45.992 --> 02:05:52.050
MARISHA: And I take-- and I cast Control Water,
and I just take the pool-- the water in the bottom

02:05:52.050 --> 02:05:57.356
of the pool, and I bend it, and I part the pool,
and I take it and I cascade it all the way up,

02:05:57.356 --> 02:05:59.002
following the lava flows.

02:05:59.002 --> 02:06:04.178
MATT: Okay. Just so you're aware, the pool is
about 600 feet across.

02:06:04.178 --> 02:06:05.444
(all laugh)

02:06:05.444 --> 02:06:06.565
MARISHA: I can part seas with this.

02:06:06.565 --> 02:06:10.601
MATT: Right. So you can part elements of it, but
like, it is a large, large, large body of water.

02:06:10.601 --> 02:06:13.712
MARISHA: Oh, okay, okay. Well I'm taking-- okay. I
don't necessarily part it, but I take the water,

02:06:13.712 --> 02:06:17.113
and I draw it up, cascading along the edges
following

02:06:17.113 --> 02:06:20.349
all the lava streams going into the tunnels.

02:06:20.349 --> 02:06:24.274
MATT: Okay, another thing you notice, is there are
two trolls and an ogre currently trying to stay

02:06:24.274 --> 02:06:29.098
afloat, as one of them just (sucking sound) gets
pulled under the water.

02:06:29.098 --> 02:06:30.077
LAURA: Gets pulled under?

02:06:30.077 --> 02:06:31.084
MATT: Yes.

02:06:31.084 --> 02:06:32.134
SAM: (yells)

02:06:32.134 --> 02:06:36.195
MATT: You begin moving the water to the sides and
you begin to cool some of the lava flows.

02:06:36.195 --> 02:06:37.350
ORION: Oh, that's awesome.

02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:41.558
MATT: You can see the glowing red magma begin to
cool to a dark black and become solid. As it does

02:06:41.558 --> 02:06:44.770
you can see parts of it crack, as the magma's
still pushing out. But you're definitely

02:06:44.770 --> 02:06:46.294
staunching the flow.

02:06:46.294 --> 02:06:50.641
MARISHA: I'm gonna kind of push it, you said there
was a tunnel kind of going up into Cthulhu side?

02:06:50.641 --> 02:06:57.106
MATT: Yeah, there is a tunnel that seemed-- the
opening leads to the back, and there's a waterfall

02:06:57.106 --> 02:06:59.147
that is pouring out from that side.

02:06:59.147 --> 02:07:00.135
ORION: Waterfall.

02:07:00.135 --> 02:07:00.853
MARISHA: There's a waterfall.

02:07:00.853 --> 02:07:01.565
MATT: Waterfall.

02:07:01.565 --> 02:07:02.459
ORION: Not a lava fall.

02:07:02.459 --> 02:07:05.109
MATT: The lava flow is going down the opposite
direction.

02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:07.709
MARISHA: But there's like a tunnel kind of carving
out that way?

02:07:07.709 --> 02:07:09.395
MATT: Yeah. Like a large opening that continues
further down.

02:07:09.395 --> 02:07:13.019
MARISHA: Okay, I take all of the water, and I
really just concentrate, and I gather just a big

02:07:13.019 --> 02:07:15.414
tube, and I push it down that tunnel.

02:07:15.414 --> 02:07:20.307
MATT: Okay, so the best-- the water that you
gather from this, you force into a quick geyser in

02:07:20.307 --> 02:07:25.873
that direction. As it sprays across the front, you
can see it begins to cool some of the magma. It's

02:07:25.873 --> 02:07:32.076
a pretty hefty flow, you manage to slow it, and
you do cool parts of it, but it's gonna be

02:07:32.076 --> 02:07:36.019
difficult and take you a while, if you're just
constantly pushing water on it, to give the flow

02:07:36.019 --> 02:07:41.570
any sort of serious stop. You notice the lava flow
doesn't coat the entire floor of the tunnel, just

02:07:41.570 --> 02:07:44.432
a side of it. It's almost like there's some
portion of it that is walkable,

02:07:44.432 --> 02:07:46.179
adjacent to the lava.

02:07:46.179 --> 02:07:49.992
ORION: We can also go in the not-lava cave,
Keyleth.

02:07:49.992 --> 02:07:54.763
MARISHA: I'm sorry, that lava cave just looks
important.

02:07:54.763 --> 02:07:56.872
ORION: I know. Because of the lava.

02:07:56.872 --> 02:07:58.651
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:07:58.651 --> 02:08:01.433
ORION: Let's go tell the others what we've
found, and then we'll

02:08:01.433 --> 02:08:02.819
come back and decide which way to go.

02:08:02.819 --> 02:08:03.627
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

02:08:03.627 --> 02:08:04.817
TALIESIN: Sometimes a lava cave is just a lava
cave.

02:08:04.817 --> 02:08:05.897
ORION: I fly back up.

02:08:05.897 --> 02:08:06.729
MATT: Okay.

02:08:06.729 --> 02:08:08.704
ORION: Guys. Blah-blah-blah-blah.

02:08:08.704 --> 02:08:10.219
SAM: So here's my thoughts.

02:08:10.219 --> 02:08:12.796
MATT: The other troll. (sucking sound) Pulled
beneath the surface.

02:08:12.796 --> 02:08:14.130
SAM: Yeah, so, I don't wanna go down there--

02:08:14.130 --> 02:08:15.508
MARISHA: Also, it looks like there's something
eating those trolls.

02:08:15.508 --> 02:08:18.139
SAM: -- there's things pulling trolls. Yeah, let's
not go down there where there's things eating

02:08:18.139 --> 02:08:19.749
trolls! Why don't we just--

02:08:19.749 --> 02:08:20.756
ORION: In the water?

02:08:20.756 --> 02:08:21.654
SAM: Yeah!

02:08:21.654 --> 02:08:22.807
MATT: Yeah. In the giant water pool in the
bottom.

02:08:22.807 --> 02:08:24.139
LAURA: Wait, but we're gonna have to go down
eventually, so.

02:08:24.139 --> 02:08:24.840
LIAM: Maybe.

02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:25.670
SAM: Why?

02:08:25.670 --> 02:08:26.637
LAURA: Okay.

02:08:26.637 --> 02:08:29.660
SAM: Why do we have to go down there, there's
nothing that we need down there!

02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:35.065
ORION: But across the way is a 25-man battle with
a huge, nasty boss.

02:08:35.065 --> 02:08:36.833
SAM: There's seven of us and one of us is Grog!

02:08:36.833 --> 02:08:38.975
LAURA: Well, everybody keeps saying that
everything is deeper and deeper, so I think we're

02:08:38.975 --> 02:08:39.805
gonna have to go--

02:08:39.805 --> 02:08:40.523
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:08:40.523 --> 02:08:41.504
LAURA: -- deep down. Eventually.

02:08:41.504 --> 02:08:42.487
MARISHA: I agree with Vex on this one.

02:08:42.487 --> 02:08:43.497
LIAM: Well, hold on.

02:08:43.497 --> 02:08:44.414
SAM: Deep into the tunnels.

02:08:44.414 --> 02:08:47.368
LIAM: All those assholes are still standing on the
edge across there. Do we have-- we've flown out of

02:08:47.368 --> 02:08:51.260
a falling tower before, we were all able to do it,
can we just fly up and

02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:54.444
over those shitheads and go towards the tunnel?

02:08:54.444 --> 02:08:56.073
ORION: Not with the eye of that mind flayer.

02:08:56.073 --> 02:08:57.360
LAURA: Yeah. It can grab us.

02:08:57.360 --> 02:08:58.747
MARISHA: Yeah, look what it did to you!

02:08:58.747 --> 02:08:59.482
ORION: I don't trust it.

02:08:59.482 --> 02:09:00.450
LAURA: Exactly.

02:09:00.450 --> 02:09:01.808
LIAM: Can't we go 150 feet in the air, and--

02:09:01.808 --> 02:09:02.729
LAURA: The tunnel doesn't go that high.

02:09:02.729 --> 02:09:04.901
MARISHA: I think you were at least 150 feet across
that bridge when he did that to you.

02:09:04.901 --> 02:09:06.165
LAURA: Yeah. It can grab us from there.

02:09:06.165 --> 02:09:07.527
SAM: We can try--

02:09:07.527 --> 02:09:10.152
LIAM: I was on the bridge when that happened--

02:09:10.152 --> 02:09:11.374
MATT: You were on the bridge when that happened,
you were--

02:09:11.374 --> 02:09:12.511
LIAM: -- and fell down. I wasn't way above.

02:09:12.511 --> 02:09:14.154
MARISHA: But the bridge was like 250 feet across,
right?

02:09:14.154 --> 02:09:17.474
MATT: Right. You were about, loosely, 80 feet
across when it got you.

02:09:17.474 --> 02:09:18.368
LIAM: When it got me.

02:09:18.368 --> 02:09:19.537
ORION: So its range is probably like 100 feet.

02:09:19.537 --> 02:09:21.865
LIAM: And you said it's 150-ish feet in here,
though, to the ceiling?

02:09:21.865 --> 02:09:24.377
MATT: To the ceiling it's about 150 feet, yeah.

02:09:24.377 --> 02:09:25.184
LIAM: We can go--

02:09:25.184 --> 02:09:27.722
LAURA: But the tunnel, oh--

02:09:27.722 --> 02:09:30.637
TALIESIN: They have ranged weapons as well.

02:09:30.637 --> 02:09:32.111
LAURA: (quietly) I think we should go down!

02:09:32.111 --> 02:09:34.254
SAM: But what is down there?

02:09:34.254 --> 02:09:35.445
TRAVIS: If we don't find out.

02:09:35.445 --> 02:09:36.771
LAURA: Kima!

02:09:36.826 --> 02:09:38.149
TRAVIS: You can drop me like a depth charge.

02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:40.598
SAM: But there's no sign of anything intelligent
down there, other than something that's eating

02:09:40.598 --> 02:09:46.294
trolls underwater. It could be just giant whales
down there! We have no idea! There's no sign of

02:09:46.294 --> 02:09:50.314
humans at all! It's lava and death animals!

02:09:50.314 --> 02:09:51.834
LAURA: Maybe, okay. If I go down there--

02:09:51.834 --> 02:09:53.162
ORION: There's more like tunnels, that go
further--

02:09:53.162 --> 02:09:54.636
LAURA: -- and look in one of the tunnels--

02:09:54.636 --> 02:09:55.906
MARISHA: Tunnels that go deeper!

02:09:55.906 --> 02:09:57.683
LAURA: -- can I look in one of the tunnels and see
if I find tracks? If I do, can we go that way?

02:09:57.683 --> 02:09:58.774
SAM: How're you gonna go in the tunnels?

02:09:58.774 --> 02:09:59.665
LAURA: I've got a flying carpet!

02:09:59.665 --> 02:10:00.487
SAM: There's lava!

02:10:00.487 --> 02:10:02.073
LAURA: There's tunnels that don't have lava
flowing into them.

02:10:02.073 --> 02:10:02.928
SAM: If you burn--

02:10:02.928 --> 02:10:04.454
MARISHA: And I can control water for at least an
hour.

02:10:04.454 --> 02:10:05.911
ORION: There's, so, down there, there's a big pool
of water--

02:10:05.911 --> 02:10:06.773
MARISHA: It lasts a while.

02:10:06.773 --> 02:10:10.388
ORION: -- a tunnel going towards the mind flayer
side, with no lava--

02:10:10.388 --> 02:10:11.181
LAURA: Exactly!

02:10:11.181 --> 02:10:12.620
ORION: -- and then there's another cave with
lava--

02:10:12.620 --> 02:10:13.970
LAURA: There is a tunnel that we can walk in.

02:10:13.970 --> 02:10:15.316
ORION: -- that we can go, going away from him.

02:10:15.316 --> 02:10:16.717
TALIESIN: Let's see if there's anything resembling
tracks--

02:10:16.717 --> 02:10:17.567
LAURA: Yes!

02:10:17.567 --> 02:10:20.219
MARISHA: I'll go with Vex that-a-way. I can cool
lava as we go.

02:10:20.219 --> 02:10:22.429
LAURA: Please, Scanlan, let me look for tracks.
Please?

02:10:22.429 --> 02:10:23.957
SAM: Tracks in a river?

02:10:23.957 --> 02:10:25.409
LAURA: Tracks in a tunnel.

02:10:25.409 --> 02:10:26.925
SAM: It's not that kind of a tunnel!

02:10:26.925 --> 02:10:27.620
LAURA: It is!

02:10:27.620 --> 02:10:29.082
SAM: There's water flowing in it!

02:10:29.082 --> 02:10:34.946
MATT: There is, on-- Okay. In a giant cavern,
there is, towards the side where you guys kind of

02:10:34.946 --> 02:10:36.289
entered, underneath where you first came in--

02:10:36.289 --> 02:10:37.005
LAURA: Yes.

02:10:37.005 --> 02:10:41.442
MATT: -- there is a descending, large tunnel, of
which there are a series of lava flows that kind

02:10:41.442 --> 02:10:44.906
of pool into one river of lava that covers half of
that path down--

02:10:44.906 --> 02:10:45.635
LAURA: Okay.

02:10:45.635 --> 02:10:46.604
LIAM: In the direction of goblin town.

02:10:46.604 --> 02:10:47.278
MATT: Correct.

02:10:47.278 --> 02:10:48.089
LAURA: Okay.

02:10:48.089 --> 02:10:49.260
MATT: Towards the other side, the--

02:10:49.260 --> 02:10:50.358
LIAM: The Cthulhu side.

02:10:50.358 --> 02:10:53.857
MATT: The cavern ends and there is a waterfall
pouring out of the side of the wall--

02:10:53.857 --> 02:10:54.719
SAM: Can't go in there.

02:10:54.719 --> 02:10:56.018
MATT: -- that just kind of flows down--

02:10:56.018 --> 02:10:57.842
SAM: Oh, so there's a cavern opening?

02:10:57.842 --> 02:11:02.122
MATT: No, no. There is a-- there-- well, there is
essentially a hole where water is pouring out of.

02:11:02.122 --> 02:11:02.892
SAM: Can't go in there.

02:11:02.892 --> 02:11:03.717
LAURA: Oh.

02:11:03.717 --> 02:11:04.700
MARISHA: We can go in there!

02:11:04.700 --> 02:11:05.815
TALIESIN: But we can go in the one with lava.

02:11:05.815 --> 02:11:07.135
SAM: There's water pouring out of it!

02:11:07.135 --> 02:11:08.753
MARISHA: I can make that stop happening.

02:11:08.753 --> 02:11:11.985
SAM: But what would we find in a tunnel with water
pouring out of it?

02:11:11.985 --> 02:11:13.926
It's not like anything lives up there!

02:11:13.926 --> 02:11:19.525
MARISHA: I'm just-- I would much rather face
random beasts who are just random beasts, than

02:11:19.525 --> 02:11:21.434
mind flayers who can suck my brain out.

02:11:21.434 --> 02:11:23.183
TALIESIN: There would be no random beasts, though,
it's just nothing but plumbing.

02:11:23.183 --> 02:11:26.701
LIAM: Yes, but Kima did not fall prey to random
beasts, she fell prey to these shits.

02:11:26.701 --> 02:11:29.457
LAURA: All right, fine! Let's do whatever you guys
want to do.

02:11:29.457 --> 02:11:32.638
MARISHA: I think-- I don't think a boss battle-- I
don't think we can fight this guy and win!

02:11:32.638 --> 02:11:35.847
TRAVIS: Vote. Vote. For fuck's sake, vote. Put it
to a vote.

02:11:35.847 --> 02:11:37.051
LIAM: Vote, yes.

02:11:37.051 --> 02:11:42.909
SAM: All right. All in favor of going to the
duergar village and facing the giant fucker.

02:11:42.909 --> 02:11:44.764
LIAM: Up and over, up and over!

02:11:44.764 --> 02:11:49.118
SAM: Or up and over. Or at least getting past it.
That direction. That's four of us.

02:11:49.118 --> 02:11:50.047
TRAVIS: That's four.

02:11:50.047 --> 02:11:53.938
SAM: All in favor of going into the lava flows, to
find something.

02:11:53.938 --> 02:11:54.955
LAURA: Water holes!

02:11:54.955 --> 02:11:55.954
LIAM: Water holes or fire holes?

02:11:55.954 --> 02:11:56.896
MARISHA: Water holes!

02:11:56.896 --> 02:11:57.882
SAM: Mm. Mm.

02:11:57.882 --> 02:11:59.809
MARISHA: Tiberius, you haven't voted!

02:11:59.809 --> 02:12:01.383
ORION: A Draconian does not vote.

02:12:01.383 --> 02:12:02.897
TRAVIS: What are you, Switzerland? C'mon.

02:12:02.897 --> 02:12:04.010
LAURA: It's four against us anyway.

02:12:04.010 --> 02:12:05.536
MARISHA: A Draconian-- you come from a political
family!

02:12:05.536 --> 02:12:06.241
LAURA: We gotta go that way.

02:12:06.241 --> 02:12:09.695
ORION: Well, I don't vote. I don't believe in our
system. Anyway, that's none of your business.

02:12:09.695 --> 02:12:11.027
SAM: Are you a communist?

02:12:11.027 --> 02:12:12.238
(all laugh)

02:12:12.238 --> 02:12:14.045
ORION: I don't know what that means!

02:12:14.045 --> 02:12:20.650
LIAM: Now. Tiberius can fly, Keyleth is an eagle
who can carry a gnome, and maybe my sister?

02:12:20.650 --> 02:12:22.405
LAURA: Ugh, no.

02:12:22.405 --> 02:12:25.781
LIAM: And that leaves Percy and Grog and I on the
flying carpet. Can it hold our weight? Let's give

02:12:25.781 --> 02:12:26.772
it a little test?

02:12:26.772 --> 02:12:27.838
LAURA: And Trinket!

02:12:27.838 --> 02:12:28.817
MARISHA: Okay, well, if this doesn't work, we're
going to the tunnel.

02:12:28.817 --> 02:12:29.806
MATT: The flying carpet can't carry Grog on his
own.

02:12:29.806 --> 02:12:30.880
LAURA: No, then I can't carry Grog.

02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:31.827
TALIESIN: You can, on the other hand, use--

02:12:31.827 --> 02:12:34.538
MARISHA: Can't-- wait, wait, wait. Why can't, why
can't Vex and I just, at least,

02:12:34.538 --> 02:12:35.660
go check it out before we do this?

02:12:35.660 --> 02:12:36.714
LIAM: You lost the vote, Keyleth. You lost the
vote.

02:12:36.714 --> 02:12:37.539
MARISHA: (sighs)

02:12:37.539 --> 02:12:38.444
LAURA: I think we should go.

02:12:38.444 --> 02:12:38.987
LIAM: Feather Fall--

02:12:38.987 --> 02:12:39.886
MARISHA: Let's do it! Fuck it!

02:12:39.886 --> 02:12:40.460
LAURA: Going!

02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:41.380
MARISHA: They don't control us!

02:12:41.380 --> 02:12:42.076
LAURA: We're going.

02:12:42.076 --> 02:12:43.031
MARISHA: Let's do it. We're going.

02:12:43.031 --> 02:12:46.220
MATT: All right, So, what, you ladies hop on the
flying carpet?

02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:47.366
LAURA &amp;amp; MARISHA: Yes.

02:12:47.366 --> 02:12:48.633
LIAM: The fellowship has broken.

02:12:48.633 --> 02:12:50.019
MATT: (laughs) So, as you guys are discussing
this--

02:12:50.019 --> 02:12:51.808
SAM: Wait, you're stealing our flying carpet?

02:12:51.808 --> 02:12:52.947
(all laugh)

02:12:52.947 --> 02:12:53.804
MATT: The two ladies have leaped on the flying
carpet--

02:12:53.804 --> 02:12:55.744
MARISHA: We're just checking it out! We're coming
back! We're coming back.

02:12:55.744 --> 02:12:56.703
LAURA: We're coming back!

02:12:56.703 --> 02:12:58.209
ORION: Throw a red one! Throw a red one.

02:12:58.209 --> 02:12:59.614
MARISHA: Just wait ten god damn minutes.

02:12:59.614 --> 02:13:02.455
MATT: They shout, as they disappear, into the
darkness below the cavern.

02:13:02.455 --> 02:13:04.465
LIAM: The mind flayer isn't on pause!

02:13:04.465 --> 02:13:05.848
LAURA: Okay, I could, I have, wait! I have a--

02:13:05.848 --> 02:13:06.852
ORION: That was gonna go right in my mouth!

02:13:06.852 --> 02:13:07.693
LAURA: I have a lantern.

02:13:07.693 --> 02:13:08.485
MATT: Okay.

02:13:08.485 --> 02:13:09.516
LAURA: Yeah. Cause I have a dungeoneering kit.

02:13:09.516 --> 02:13:10.362
TALIESIN: Oh, cool! Yellow.

02:13:10.362 --> 02:13:13.447
MATT: All right. So you pull out your lantern, as
the two of you are going down towards the water--

02:13:13.447 --> 02:13:14.241
LAURA: Part the water!

02:13:14.241 --> 02:13:17.529
MATT: -- the rest of you kind of stand at the edge
of the crevasse going, 'Uh...'

02:13:17.529 --> 02:13:19.111
ORION: I follow. I follow.

02:13:19.111 --> 02:13:20.191
LAURA: Part the water!

02:13:20.191 --> 02:13:22.530
MARISHA: I take the river flow, where the water's
flow is coming out of this waterfall--

02:13:22.530 --> 02:13:26.700
LIAM: Meanwhile the mind flayer's saying,
(gravelly voice) 'I haven't got all day.'

02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:27.692
MARISHA: -- and I reverse it.

02:13:27.692 --> 02:13:28.989
MATT: All right. So as you guys float down--

02:13:28.989 --> 02:13:29.925
ORION: I follow.

02:13:29.925 --> 02:13:31.822
MATT: -- the two trolls that were missing-- the
ogre is not anywhere to be seen.

02:13:31.822 --> 02:13:33.043
TRAVIS: Fly, you fools!

02:13:33.043 --> 02:13:33.985
LIAM: (laughs)

02:13:33.985 --> 02:13:35.274
MATT: -- there's just a slight ripple in the
water's surface.

02:13:35.274 --> 02:13:36.346
LAURA: We don't wanna land, we just wanna go
towards the tunnel.

02:13:36.346 --> 02:13:40.633
MATT: Right. As you staunch the water supply of
this waterfall, it just kind of holds it in place,

02:13:40.633 --> 02:13:44.137
with enough of a force that the water coming out
is being balanced by the force you're putting back

02:13:44.137 --> 02:13:45.909
on it, it's just kind of holding it there.

02:13:45.909 --> 02:13:47.298
LAURA: Can you lower the water, so we can fly--

02:13:47.298 --> 02:13:51.456
MATT: However, as the water vanishes, beneath
where the waterfall was, you can see an actual

02:13:51.456 --> 02:13:53.626
small tunnel that's carved into the rock--

02:13:53.626 --> 02:13:55.122
LAURA: Fuck all y'all bitches!

02:13:55.122 --> 02:13:56.726
TALIESIN: Whoa. (laughs)

02:13:56.726 --> 02:13:57.990
LIAM: Well, wanna go down?

02:13:57.990 --> 02:13:59.017
LAURA: Let's go in there!

02:13:59.017 --> 02:14:00.322
TRAVIS: That doesn't do anything yet! We don't
know!

02:14:00.322 --> 02:14:01.432
LAURA: Let's go into the tunnel.

02:14:01.432 --> 02:14:05.916
SAM: Meanwhile, back up top, I'm saying, they're
not gonna find anything.

02:14:05.916 --> 02:14:07.644
They're not gonna find any tunnels.

02:14:07.644 --> 02:14:08.734
(all laugh)

02:14:08.734 --> 02:14:11.807
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm agreeing with Scanlan, and I am
mooning off the cliff's face.

02:14:11.987 --> 02:14:14.071
LAURA: So I'm stealthing, let's stealth? Let's be
very quiet.

02:14:14.071 --> 02:14:14.741
MARISHA: Okay.

02:14:14.741 --> 02:14:15.620
ORION: Hold on.

02:14:15.620 --> 02:14:16.335
MATT: All right.

02:14:16.335 --> 02:14:17.269
LAURA: Can you turn into an animal?

02:14:17.269 --> 02:14:18.240
ORION: I fly back up to tell them what's going
on.

02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:18.985
MARISHA: Oh, I can!

02:14:18.985 --> 02:14:21.343
I go into a black panther form.

02:14:21.418 --> 02:14:22.234
MATT: Okay.

02:14:22.234 --> 02:14:23.472
LIAM: Scanlan, remember when we had women in this
party?

02:14:23.472 --> 02:14:24.465
LAURA: Okay, and I stealth.

02:14:24.465 --> 02:14:25.280
SAM: (laughs)

02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:26.335
MATT: Okay, both of you guys roll stealth.

02:14:26.335 --> 02:14:27.585
MARISHA: Panthers have, like, advantage on
stealth, something like that?

02:14:27.585 --> 02:14:28.731
MATT: They have advantage on stealth check. Yeah.

02:14:28.731 --> 02:14:30.231
ORION: You guys are just in further then?

02:14:30.231 --> 02:14:32.468
MARISHA: 16. 13. So 16 plus whatever--

02:14:32.468 --> 02:14:33.457
MATT: Plus your dex.

02:14:33.457 --> 02:14:34.273
LAURA: 15.

02:14:34.273 --> 02:14:35.374
MARISHA: -- the dex of the panther is.

02:14:35.374 --> 02:14:36.031
LAURA: Plus, oh.

02:14:36.031 --> 02:14:37.235
MARISHA: No, it's whatever the dex-- it's gonna be
like--

02:14:37.235 --> 02:14:38.090
ORION: Oh.

02:14:38.090 --> 02:14:39.330
TALIESIN: (sings) The dex of the panther--

02:14:39.330 --> 02:14:40.362
MARISHA: It's gonna be like 20 or something like
that.

02:14:40.362 --> 02:14:44.836
MATT: All right. You guys move-- are you staying
on the carpet?

02:14:44.836 --> 02:14:47.906
LAURA: No, we're like hopping down off the carpet,
and I just want to look around for tracks!

02:14:47.906 --> 02:14:48.796
MARISHA: Plus four.

02:14:48.796 --> 02:14:49.559
ORION: I take the carpet--

02:14:49.559 --> 02:14:50.464
MARISHA: No, plus six.

02:14:50.464 --> 02:14:52.057
ORION: -- and then I bring it up, while I tell
them all that stuff.

02:14:52.057 --> 02:14:53.827
MATT: Okay, so you go back down--

02:14:53.827 --> 02:14:55.989
LAURA: What! You took our carpet?

02:14:55.989 --> 02:14:58.920
ORION: Oh yes, because they need it to get down
here as well.

02:14:58.980 --> 02:15:00.606
LAURA: Oh, we're going-- okay, you guys are joining
us. All right.

02:15:00.606 --> 02:15:02.107
ORION: I was--

02:15:02.282 --> 02:15:03.250
MARISHA: No, we were scouting.

02:15:03.250 --> 02:15:04.651
LAURA: I'm just looking for tracks right now,
Tiberius.

02:15:04.651 --> 02:15:07.935
ORION: Yeah and I followed you, saw what was going
on, took your carpet,

02:15:07.935 --> 02:15:09.231
and I'm giving it back to them.

02:15:09.231 --> 02:15:10.006
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:15:10.006 --> 02:15:10.890
MATT: So as you guys are--

02:15:10.890 --> 02:15:12.491
MARISHA: You can't take our carpet, we're on the
carpet.

02:15:12.491 --> 02:15:13.420
ORION: Oh, I thought you guys hopped off.

02:15:13.420 --> 02:15:15.834
MATT: No, you guys stepped off the carpet, she
said, and you transformed, began stealthing in.

02:15:15.834 --> 02:15:18.850
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. We did transform. Okay,
sure, you can take the carpet.

02:15:18.850 --> 02:15:20.325
MATT: As you're doing that you turn around and see
Tiberius had rolled the carpet

02:15:20.325 --> 02:15:21.748
and is currently taking it away.

02:15:21.748 --> 02:15:23.051
LAURA: You motherfucker.

02:15:23.051 --> 02:15:25.889
MATT: So you guys are on the bottom of this
crevasse and Tiberius disappears into the darkness.

02:15:25.889 --> 02:15:30.541
Okay, well, go ahead and roll-- this would be
survival for tracking?

02:15:30.598 --> 02:15:33.271
Just to get an idea for anything around you see.

02:15:33.271 --> 02:15:34.442
LAURA: 16.

02:15:34.442 --> 02:15:40.138
MATT: You do see some scratches into the mud of
the surface there that lead into a tunnel. You see

02:15:40.138 --> 02:15:45.314
drag marks, you see footprints, and that's the
best you can make out at this in this point in

02:15:45.314 --> 02:15:50.673
time. But the footprints appear to be dwarven, or
dwarf-sized in nature.

02:15:50.673 --> 02:15:53.955
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see what the
scratch marks look like? If they look like any

02:15:53.955 --> 02:15:55.443
type of beast I might recognize.

02:15:55.443 --> 02:15:58.469
MATT: The scratch marks are across the ground, it
looks just like fingers being pulled through.

02:15:58.469 --> 02:16:04.058
MARISHA: Any type of residue, any type of slime?

02:16:04.058 --> 02:16:06.216
MATT: No that you can tell, no.

02:16:06.216 --> 02:16:08.584
LAURA: Can we see where the tunnel leads?

02:16:08.584 --> 02:16:11.361
MATT: From what you can see, there's no 
light source in there.

02:16:11.361 --> 02:16:13.499
LAURA: We have the light, remember, when I--

02:16:13.570 --> 02:16:20.025
MATT: So you take a lantern and put it inside. The
tunnel goes back about 25 feet and then stops.

02:16:20.025 --> 02:16:25.211
It's just a little alcove. You see within the
tunnel a series of

02:16:25.211 --> 02:16:28.500
skeletons or bodies that are partially decomposed.

02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:30.246
TALIESIN: Oh. God.

02:16:30.246 --> 02:16:33.470
MATT: And you see what looks like a pile of rags
in the corner.

02:16:33.470 --> 02:16:35.334
TRAVIS: Go check it out.

02:16:35.334 --> 02:16:36.984
LAURA: So we can either run or loot. What should
we do?

02:16:36.984 --> 02:16:38.847
TRAVIS: No, go check it out, ladies.

02:16:38.847 --> 02:16:43.371
SAM: They're not gonna find anything.

02:16:43.371 --> 02:16:48.782
MARISHA: They're telling us not to be stupid
because we don't have support.

02:16:48.782 --> 02:16:51.157
Should we be stupid?

02:16:51.157 --> 02:16:52.205
TRAVIS: Grog says yes.

02:16:52.205 --> 02:16:54.546
LAURA: Oh, I'm so scared, but okay, here's the
thing,

02:16:54.546 --> 02:16:58.373
I remember another situation very similar to this.

02:16:58.373 --> 02:17:00.105
ORION: It was terrible.

02:17:00.105 --> 02:17:05.106
LAURA: And it was the lair of one of those umber 
hulks.

02:17:05.106 --> 02:17:07.445
MARISHA: Right. Why don't we just go back maybe to
the entrance of the--

02:17:07.445 --> 02:17:09.019
LIAM: Vex'ahlia, what is going on down there?

02:17:09.019 --> 02:17:10.916
TRAVIS: No no no no. Be thorough.

02:17:10.916 --> 02:17:12.026
(all laugh)

02:17:12.026 --> 02:17:15.290
LAURA: Oh brother, I think we found the lair of the
umber hulk

02:17:15.375 --> 02:17:16.590
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

02:17:16.590 --> 02:17:18.732
LAURA: Oh, pretty damn sure.

02:17:18.732 --> 02:17:22.722
MATT: It's very-- well, the actual tunnel is maybe
about five to eight feet across and it would not

02:17:22.788 --> 02:17:24.350
be able to fit an umber hulk.

02:17:24.350 --> 02:17:26.998
LAURA: Oh, really? Can I go along the walls very
stealthily

02:17:26.998 --> 02:17:29.711
and see if I can find any opening, anything else?

02:17:29.711 --> 02:17:32.638
MATT: As you step inside and put your hands
across the walls--

02:17:32.638 --> 02:17:34.744
TALIESIN and LAURA: Oh God. Oh.

02:17:34.744 --> 02:17:40.314
MATT: --what you do notice is, the walls are
solid. This appears to have been carved out over time.

02:17:40.314 --> 02:17:47.427
And as you move in, you begin to see the rags, and
the pile of rags is less a pile of rags and more

02:17:47.487 --> 02:17:55.617
some sort of humanoid curled up in on the inside.
Unconscious, asleep, or dead. Not moving.

02:17:55.617 --> 02:17:58.075
MARISHA: What is she-- what do they look like?

02:17:58.075 --> 02:18:02.097
MATT: You can't tell from here. It's just like
kind of curled over in the corner.

02:18:02.097 --> 02:18:03.047
TRAVIS: Go in there.

02:18:03.047 --> 02:18:06.716
TALIESIN: I'd like to roll a save against smugness
really quickly. Can I save against smugness? I

02:18:06.716 --> 02:18:08.949
feel a wave of smugness in here.

02:18:08.949 --> 02:18:11.735
MATT: I think you might. You're not saved against
smugness, Percy.

02:18:11.735 --> 02:18:18.460
LAURA: Keyleth, I think you should turn into an
eagle. Can she turn into

02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:20.592
something big enough that can carry me?

02:18:20.592 --> 02:18:24.502
MATT: She can. Yeah. A giant eagle, I believe you
can.

02:18:24.502 --> 02:18:29.132
LAURA: What if you turn into something big enough
that it can carry me, I hop on your back and we

02:18:29.132 --> 02:18:32.605
throw something at it? And then fly away.

02:18:32.605 --> 02:18:33.808
(all laugh)

02:18:33.808 --> 02:18:36.778
MATT: While you guys are having this conversation,
'cause you're talking to each other--

02:18:36.838 --> 02:18:38.829
LAURA: Fuck. We were talking really quietly.

02:18:38.829 --> 02:18:46.848
MATT: -- the thing in the corner kind of rouses
and shoots up out of sudden fear movement, looking

02:18:46.848 --> 02:18:57.232
about. You see, dressed in rags-- you guys are
seeing this for the first time, but it's familiar.

02:18:57.232 --> 02:19:04.820
Smooth head, purplish and blue in color, a series
of tentacles in its mouth. A giant scar drawn

02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:13.461
across one of its eyes, and it looks filthy, and
it looks desperate. And just looks at the two of

02:19:13.523 --> 02:19:17.106
you and you hear a sudden voice in your minds.

02:19:17.106 --> 02:19:18.147
LAURA: Oh fuck!

02:19:18.147 --> 02:19:25.335
MATT: No movement, just conversation, saying, 
"What, who are you?"

02:19:25.396 --> 02:19:32.860
MARISHA: I drop to my knees and I look at him and
just say, it's okay, we're friends.

02:19:32.860 --> 02:19:37.697
MATT: He puts up a hand like this and you see
there's a flicker of arcane energy and a barrier

02:19:37.697 --> 02:19:41.246
appears between you and this creature. And just
looks.

02:19:41.246 --> 02:19:47.368
MARISHA: I take my Druidcraft and I just make a
little flower.

02:19:47.368 --> 02:19:48.450
LAURA: Oh my God.

02:19:48.450 --> 02:19:50.915
(all laugh)

02:19:50.915 --> 02:19:59.333
MARISHA: And there's a pretty little tulip and I
lay it at the edge of the barrier.

02:19:59.333 --> 02:20:03.204
LIAM: (Gollum voice) Nasty.

02:20:03.204 --> 02:20:05.198
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:20:05.198 --> 02:20:07.178
(all laugh)

02:20:07.249 --> 02:20:09.289
MATT: With disadvantage.

02:20:09.289 --> 02:20:15.814
MARISHA: With disadvantage? Okay. Nine.

02:20:15.814 --> 02:20:16.783
MATT: Okay, nine total?

02:20:16.783 --> 02:20:17.539
LAURA: Oh no.

02:20:17.539 --> 02:20:20.543
MARISHA: I'm not a very charismatic person.

02:20:20.543 --> 02:20:23.830
MATT: It holds its place, and the voice again hits
your mind and says,

02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:31.126
"How did you find me? What is your purpose here?"

02:20:31.126 --> 02:20:32.115
ORION: I fly back down.

02:20:32.115 --> 02:20:33.056
TRAVIS: No, no, no!

02:20:33.056 --> 02:20:39.210
LAURA: We don't mean to disturb you, great sire.

02:20:39.210 --> 02:20:41.654
MATT: "You will die if you try anything."

02:20:41.654 --> 02:20:42.862
LAURA: We're not going to!

02:20:42.862 --> 02:20:45.934
MATT: "I will not fall here, I will not die
here."

02:20:45.934 --> 02:20:50.957
LAURA: We mean to help you! We mean to find our
way out, and find our friend. That's all.

02:20:50.957 --> 02:20:53.606
MARISHA: We don't want to die either.

02:20:53.606 --> 02:20:57.113
LAURA: Please. Who did this to you? We can help
you.

02:20:57.113 --> 02:21:01.000
MARISHA: Let's not die together.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:07.042
MATT: You can see as you get a better look at it,
it definitely has a large scar across part of its

02:21:07.042 --> 02:21:13.243
face, and it looks to be wearing remnants of a
robe similar to what Scanlan was describing.

02:21:13.243 --> 02:21:22.689
However, it is tattered, it's dirtied, sullied by
the elements and god knows what other liquids. It

02:21:22.751 --> 02:21:28.230
also has this strange kind of metallic skull cap
that's currently placed around its head.

02:21:28.230 --> 02:21:45.337
And it just, "Leave me in peace, then, or give me
a reason not to slay you where you stand."

02:21:45.411 --> 02:21:47.152
LIAM: (whispers) Revenge.

02:21:47.152 --> 02:21:51.551
LAURA: We can help you get revenge against your
brethren who did this to you.

02:21:51.551 --> 02:21:57.582
MATT: There's a slight change in mood, you just
feel. "Revenge?"

02:21:57.582 --> 02:22:02.185
LAURA: Yes.

02:22:02.185 --> 02:22:03.975
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:22:03.975 --> 02:22:05.415
TRAVIS: Roll the shit out of that new dice.

02:22:05.415 --> 02:22:09.379
MARISHA: Come on, Vex.

02:22:09.379 --> 02:22:10.540
LAURA: 19?

02:22:10.540 --> 02:22:19.615
ORION: Yes!

02:22:19.615 --> 02:22:27.308
MATT: The barrier flickers and dissipates. It
reaches over and grabs what looks like a gnarled

02:22:27.308 --> 02:22:32.538
stick. Pulls itself up onto its legs, now what
looked like a small minuscule creature is now,

02:22:32.538 --> 02:22:39.162
even in his terrible hunched form, is standing
extremely tall, like scraping the top of this

02:22:39.162 --> 02:22:44.294
maybe eight-foot-tall ceiling in this tunnel.

02:22:44.294 --> 02:22:45.333
MARISHA: (meekly) Hi.

02:22:45.333 --> 02:22:47.106
MATT: It takes a step forward and says,

02:22:47.106 --> 02:22:58.467
"Revenge? You speak of revenge. This is a 
language I wish to know very well."

02:22:58.467 --> 02:23:02.654
MARISHA: You found the right motley crew.

02:23:02.654 --> 02:23:04.410
(all laugh)

02:23:04.410 --> 02:23:07.545
LAURA: Should we bring it with us?

02:23:07.545 --> 02:23:12.471
MARISHA: Would you like to come with us?

02:23:12.471 --> 02:23:15.034
LAURA: To leave this cavern?

02:23:15.034 --> 02:23:19.762
MARISHA: Meet our friends? We have friends.

02:23:19.762 --> 02:23:23.477
MATT: It kind of gives you both a look and you
hear this-- There's a slight lurching to it as it

02:23:23.477 --> 02:23:34.755
gives this horrible guttural-- (low chuckle)
"Friends? That's a word I haven't heard in a long

02:23:34.755 --> 02:23:46.483
"time. Not one I take to heart, but allies, in
time, that I can understand.

02:23:46.483 --> 02:23:50.366
"Take me to your allies."

02:23:50.366 --> 02:23:51.945
LAURA: Tiberius?

02:23:51.945 --> 02:23:52.978
ORION: Mm, yes?

02:23:52.978 --> 02:23:55.648
LAURA: Maybe you can send that fucking carpet back
down.

02:23:55.648 --> 02:23:57.178
(all laugh)

02:23:57.178 --> 02:23:59.466
ORION: I'll be right there, I was trying to
get the rest of the party here, but everyone's

02:23:59.466 --> 02:24:04.683
being buttholes. I fly back down with the carpet.

02:24:04.683 --> 02:24:11.525
MATT: You come down with the carpet. At the
edge of this opening, you see Keyleth, you see

02:24:11.525 --> 02:24:18.332
Vex, both emerge with a horrible tentacle-faced
gnarled being with a staff coming out with them.

02:24:18.332 --> 02:24:19.882
ORION: Hello?

02:24:19.882 --> 02:24:21.001
MARISHA: Tiberius--

02:24:21.001 --> 02:24:22.426
ORION: Oh, did you make a friend?

02:24:22.426 --> 02:24:23.830
MARISHA: We did! See! Friends!

02:24:23.830 --> 02:24:24.773
ORION: Wonderful!

02:24:24.773 --> 02:24:27.260
MARISHA: This is-- What's your name?

02:24:27.260 --> 02:24:31.793
MATT: Looks about to you, then looks at Tiberius
and says, ignoring your question,

02:24:31.793 --> 02:24:36.471
"You have persuasion to the arcane."

02:24:36.471 --> 02:24:41.370
ORION: Yes, I'm a sorcerer! I do all kinds of fun
things with the arcane!

02:24:41.370 --> 02:24:43.045
MATT: "We shall talk."

02:24:43.045 --> 02:24:48.730
ORION: Very good, I'm always willing to learn.
Seems you are very powerful.

02:24:48.730 --> 02:24:53.640
MATT: "My name... Clarota."

02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:55.652
ALL: Clarota.

02:24:55.652 --> 02:24:58.911
MARISHA: Can we call you Clarence for short?

02:24:58.911 --> 02:25:00.015
MATT: "No!"

02:25:00.015 --> 02:25:01.041
(all laugh)

02:25:01.041 --> 02:25:02.886
MARISHA: Okay! Clar-ota

02:25:02.886 --> 02:25:08.929
ALL: Clarota.

02:25:08.929 --> 02:25:10.035
LIAM: Sounds Spanish.

02:25:10.035 --> 02:25:14.523
LAURA: Please, join us on the carpet.

02:25:14.523 --> 02:25:16.100
SAM: Can he fit on the carpet?

02:25:16.100 --> 02:25:17.111
LIAM: He is very thin.

02:25:17.111 --> 02:25:17.953
LAURA: She can fly.

02:25:17.953 --> 02:25:20.033
MARISHA: I'll fly.

02:25:20.033 --> 02:25:21.856
ORION: The rest of our allies are up.

02:25:21.856 --> 02:25:26.170
MATT: He carefully steps on the carpet, once again
like its tentacles are (slithering noises).

02:25:26.170 --> 02:25:27.301
LAURA: I keep a distance.

02:25:27.301 --> 02:25:30.575
MATT: Moving around, its mouth and its eyes are
constantly darting, it looks extremely nervous and

02:25:30.575 --> 02:25:35.222
almost like a cornered animal that's just barely
being coaxed onto this journey. You see with each

02:25:35.222 --> 02:25:38.770
step it takes there a slight flicker of arcane
energy at the tip of its fingers, like it's just

02:25:38.842 --> 02:25:44.875
prepared for anything to go terribly
wrong. It steps onto the carpet and goes,

02:25:44.950 --> 02:25:48.333
"Take me to your allies."

02:25:48.333 --> 02:25:50.748
ORION: Ah yes, we have wonderful allies!

02:25:50.748 --> 02:25:54.524
MARISHA: You can even maybe call them friends,
even?

02:25:54.524 --> 02:25:56.625
LAURA: Not just yet!

02:25:56.625 --> 02:26:01.163
MATT: It crosses its legs and sits on the carpet,
holding its staff to its chest on the far corner

02:26:01.221 --> 02:26:08.884
staring at all of you and says, "Go. Now."

02:26:08.884 --> 02:26:10.819
LAURA: Hold on tight.

02:26:10.819 --> 02:26:13.865
MATT: You guys make your way up to the top,
eventually you see the carpet (whoosh) over the

02:26:13.938 --> 02:26:17.447
edge of the crevasse, come down to a rest, as your
party has now

02:26:17.447 --> 02:26:19.813
brought with you the stuff of nightmares.

02:26:19.813 --> 02:26:21.064
(all laugh)

02:26:21.064 --> 02:26:22.897
SAM: That is the thing I saw in the village!

02:26:22.897 --> 02:26:24.294
LAURA: Hold on! Hold on!

02:26:24.294 --> 02:26:25.656
TRAVIS: What is that? Oh my god!

02:26:25.656 --> 02:26:28.351
MATT: At which point, it's leapt off at this
point, hovering about and you can see this crackle

02:26:28.351 --> 02:26:30.830
of fire in its hand and it goes, (panicked
noises)

02:26:30.830 --> 02:26:31.835
LAURA: No! No!

02:26:31.835 --> 02:26:34.190
ORION: I'm standing between them, like, it's okay!
These are the allies we speak of!

02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:36.247
LAURA: Peace, friends! We are ourselves!

02:26:36.429 --> 02:26:37.603
ORION: Grog, don't do anything!

02:26:37.603 --> 02:26:38.957
LAURA: We are not controlled.

02:26:38.957 --> 02:26:43.112
ORION: Don't use a whip, Scanlan, sing a
friendly song as he is our friend-- ally. To the

02:26:43.112 --> 02:26:49.049
guy. Ally. He is-- He's in a little spot of
trouble and we are going to

02:26:49.049 --> 02:26:53.882
help him get revenge, or something of the sort.

02:26:53.882 --> 02:26:56.357
SAM: He's a friend? Help--

02:26:56.357 --> 02:26:57.777
ORION: He prefers--

02:26:57.777 --> 02:26:58.865
MATT: "Ally."

02:26:58.865 --> 02:26:59.622
LAURA: Ally.

02:26:59.622 --> 02:27:00.354
SAM: Ally.

02:27:00.354 --> 02:27:01.111
MARISHA: Ally.

02:27:01.111 --> 02:27:01.800
SAM: Ally.

02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:02.558
TALIESIN: Ally?

02:27:02.558 --> 02:27:04.910
TRAVIS: What's on your head?

02:27:04.910 --> 02:27:11.522
MATT: He kind of gives you this keen look of,
huh,

02:27:11.721 --> 02:27:13.983
the least person I expected to ask a question.

02:27:13.983 --> 02:27:16.586
(all laugh)

02:27:16.666 --> 02:27:27.286
MATT: It kind of hobbles forward with its gnarled
staff, and says, "I was cast out from my hive. I

02:27:27.286 --> 02:27:45.117
"was cursed with the mark of the arcane. My people
see that as an ill omen. I was discarded, left to die."

02:27:45.117 --> 02:27:47.767
LAURA: Let's destroy your hive.

02:27:47.767 --> 02:27:48.674
MATT: "No."

02:27:48.674 --> 02:27:49.550
LAURA: No?

02:27:49.550 --> 02:27:59.202
MATT: "You see, the hive is sick. The mind that
keeps us safe is no longer its own."

02:27:59.202 --> 02:28:00.175
ORION: Oh?

02:28:00.175 --> 02:28:11.153
MATT: "One, an alien one, has come and taken the
mind hostage, it has taken my people as its own

02:28:11.153 --> 02:28:19.510
"playthings. I was able to escape its mental
grasp."

02:28:19.510 --> 02:28:22.116
It reaches up and taps the metal on its head.

02:28:22.116 --> 02:28:24.061
LAURA: Oh! Tinfoil hat!

02:28:24.061 --> 02:28:26.694
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Magneto helmet!

02:28:26.694 --> 02:28:28.740
MARISHA: This is the guy we've needed this whole
time!

02:28:28.740 --> 02:28:36.231
MATT: "My people will not so easily escape its
grasp,

02:28:36.231 --> 02:28:43.654
"they are now under the control of this creature."

02:28:43.654 --> 02:28:44.569
MARISHA: So if we did it--

02:28:44.569 --> 02:28:48.251
SAM: If we find this creature, we might be able to
free your hive as well.

02:28:48.251 --> 02:28:55.661
MATT: "That would be why I wish to have your
alliance."

02:28:55.661 --> 02:28:56.270
LAURA: Yes.

02:28:56.270 --> 02:29:02.905
MATT: "Help me free our hivemind, free my
people."

02:29:02.905 --> 02:29:05.076
TRAVIS: (whispers) Sense motive.

02:29:05.076 --> 02:29:06.820
LAURA: Oh yeah, can we sense motive on him?

02:29:06.820 --> 02:29:09.563
MATT: (laughs) You definitely can!

02:29:09.563 --> 02:29:10.507
LAURA: Oh gosh.

02:29:10.507 --> 02:29:11.533
TRAVIS: I would do it, but--

02:29:11.533 --> 02:29:13.204
MARISHA: We should also have him help us in
your--

02:29:13.204 --> 02:29:15.019
MATT: I would put this in a group sense motive
right now.

02:29:15.019 --> 02:29:15.977
TALIESIN: Yeah! All right!

02:29:15.977 --> 02:29:17.003
MATT: Everyone roll!

02:29:17.003 --> 02:29:17.841
ORION: I rolled 14.

02:29:17.841 --> 02:29:19.485
LAURA: I rolled-- what do we add to it?

02:29:19.485 --> 02:29:24.324
MATT: Sense motive in this would be your insight,
sorry. Pathfinder to Fifth Edition!

02:29:24.324 --> 02:29:25.434
LAURA: Insight? 24.

02:29:25.434 --> 02:29:26.267
MARISHA: 18?

02:29:26.267 --> 02:29:26.992
TRAVIS: 16.

02:29:26.992 --> 02:29:27.708
ORION: 14.

02:29:27.708 --> 02:29:28.513
TALIESIN: Natural one.

02:29:28.513 --> 02:29:29.367
LAURA: (laughs) Four?

02:29:29.367 --> 02:29:30.230
LIAM: Four.

02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:31.044
TRAVIS: 16!

02:29:31.044 --> 02:29:31.703
SAM: 13.

02:29:31.703 --> 02:29:32.876
TRAVIS: (happy scream) 16!

02:29:32.876 --> 02:29:33.936
(all laugh)

02:29:33.936 --> 02:29:35.301
MATT: Okay!

02:29:35.301 --> 02:29:36.350
SAM: You're a people person!

02:29:36.350 --> 02:29:44.268
MATT: Through your intense grasping this
creature's disposition, best you can, as alien and

02:29:44.268 --> 02:29:49.946
unfamiliar as its mannerisms and speech and
interests may be, you get the feeling that it's

02:29:50.007 --> 02:29:53.973
speaking out of desperation and it's speaking out
of genuine interest. You've piqued it with the hint

02:29:53.973 --> 02:29:59.732
of revenge, you've piqued it with the idea of
alliance as opposed to being alone. You get the

02:29:59.799 --> 02:30:04.411
feeling that it speaks the truth. It genuinely is
asking for your help in freeing its people from

02:30:04.411 --> 02:30:09.075
whatever is influencing their current actions.

02:30:09.075 --> 02:30:10.986
LAURA: Clarota... (laughs)

02:30:10.986 --> 02:30:11.888
SAM: What's his name?

02:30:11.888 --> 02:30:12.798
LAURA: Cla-ro-ta?

02:30:12.798 --> 02:30:13.621
MATT: Clarota.

02:30:13.621 --> 02:30:14.865
SAM: Can we just call him Clarence?

02:30:14.865 --> 02:30:16.169
(all laugh)

02:30:16.169 --> 02:30:18.160
LIAM: (Jimmy Stewart voice) Clarence, Clarence!

02:30:18.160 --> 02:30:20.281
TALIESIN: Clara. It could be a she.

02:30:20.281 --> 02:30:27.903
LAURA: We are very interested in being allies with
you. Might we have your word that upon defeating

02:30:27.903 --> 02:30:31.125
this creature, we will be safe?

02:30:31.125 --> 02:30:38.606
SAM: And as a symbol of our dedication to you, I'd
love to play you just a little bit of a song that

02:30:38.606 --> 02:30:44.402
might heal some of those wounds and scrapes that
you seem to have all over your body.

02:30:44.402 --> 02:30:47.954
MATT: He gives you the dirtiest look you've ever
received.

02:30:47.954 --> 02:30:50.198
TRAVIS: (whispers) It was because of the arcane!

02:30:50.198 --> 02:30:55.602
SAM: It's a pretty good song!

02:30:55.602 --> 02:30:56.883
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:30:56.883 --> 02:30:58.935
(all laugh)

02:30:58.935 --> 02:31:00.683
LIAM: Come on, Burt Reynolds!

02:31:00.683 --> 02:31:02.090
SAM: Hm. Ooh! 17.

02:31:02.090 --> 02:31:05.755
(all laugh)

02:31:05.755 --> 02:31:09.694
MATT: He takes a sudden step forward towards you,
his tentacles-- (slithering noises)

02:31:09.694 --> 02:31:13.351
LAURA: Ew, ugh!

02:31:13.351 --> 02:31:16.329
MATT: "Play this song."

02:31:16.329 --> 02:31:18.048
TRAVIS: Break out the--

02:31:18.048 --> 02:31:20.544
LAURA: It better be good!

02:31:20.544 --> 02:31:28.857
SAM: (sings) When I get that feeling, I want
Clarota healing. Clarota healing is something

02:31:28.857 --> 02:31:42.634
that's good for you. Ooh ooh ooh. (sings
embellished melisma)

02:31:42.634 --> 02:31:44.157
LAURA: Clarota's dancing, I can see it!

02:31:44.157 --> 02:31:46.024
MATT: Make a persuasion check-- no, a performance
check.

02:31:46.024 --> 02:31:49.868
SAM: A performance check!

02:31:49.948 --> 02:31:50.924
18!

02:31:50.924 --> 02:31:52.029
MATT: 18.

02:31:52.029 --> 02:31:56.157
(all laugh)

02:31:56.157 --> 02:32:02.112
MATT: In spite of itself, it stands there still
glaring at you, but out of the corner of your eye

02:32:02.112 --> 02:32:04.251
you swear you see its toe tapping.

02:32:04.251 --> 02:32:08.123
(all laugh)

02:32:08.123 --> 02:32:14.173
MATT: It then kind of-- its tentacles withdraw in
such a way that gets you kind of off-put and the

02:32:14.173 --> 02:32:28.626
song comes to a halt. "I'd not heard a song. I
shall call upon you for more in the future."

02:32:28.626 --> 02:32:29.873
LAURA: Oh!

02:32:29.873 --> 02:32:33.347
SAM: There's many more where that came from!

02:32:33.410 --> 02:32:44.130
MATT: "Now we talk about how we can kill
K'varn."

02:32:44.189 --> 02:32:45.281
LAURA: K'varn!

02:32:45.281 --> 02:32:46.817
LAURA and SAM: Yes!

02:32:46.817 --> 02:32:48.436
MARISHA: Yes! Let's talk about that.

02:32:48.436 --> 02:32:49.478
SAM: End scene!

02:32:49.478 --> 02:32:51.260
MATT: And that's where we're going to go ahead and
end it for today, guys.

02:32:51.260 --> 02:32:54.774
(all cheer)

02:32:54.774 --> 02:32:58.651
MATT: That went very interestingly! We'll pick up
from that point.

02:32:58.651 --> 02:33:00.055
MARISHA: Sorry we had to rebel, you guys.

02:33:00.055 --> 02:33:01.550
LAURA: Yeah sorry about that, you guys. Sorry!

02:33:01.550 --> 02:33:03.008
MARISHA: Sorry! It was for a good cause!

02:33:03.008 --> 02:33:06.005
LIAM: Thank you for rebelling, and staking out on
your own!

02:33:06.005 --> 02:33:12.130
MATT: You've acquired for the moment a very
curious ally. Yeah, this will be an interesting

02:33:12.130 --> 02:33:13.649
branching point for next week.

02:33:13.649 --> 02:33:14.775
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

02:33:14.775 --> 02:33:15.792
TRAVIS: We should get some damn hats.

02:33:15.792 --> 02:33:17.322
LAURA: I know! We should get him to make us hats!

02:33:17.322 --> 02:33:19.908
MARISHA: We definitely need one for Grog. We have
to get him to make us hats for Grog.

02:33:19.908 --> 02:33:20.905
TRAVIS: Why me?

02:33:20.905 --> 02:33:28.836
MATT: (laughs) I hope you guys enjoyed that! No
combat. You guys avoided quite a few possibilities

02:33:28.836 --> 02:33:33.391
for battle and that makes for an interesting
dynamic. So well done!

02:33:33.391 --> 02:33:35.345
You've killed a crap ton of duergar.

02:33:35.403 --> 02:33:36.294
LIAM: Trolls.

02:33:36.294 --> 02:33:38.914
MATT: And a couple trolls and an ogre, by sending
them off a cliff!

02:33:38.914 --> 02:33:41.589
It was a pretty eventful evening!

02:33:41.589 --> 02:33:43.403
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:33:43.403 --> 02:33:46.585
MATT: So yeah, so guys, thank you so much for
watching! Also, as a reminder, there is Dwarven

02:33:46.585 --> 02:33:51.213
Forge that's been doing an amazing kickstarter for
its next set. I was a supporter for all of Dwarven

02:33:51.213 --> 02:33:54.732
Forge's kickstarters and I'm looking forward to
being able to break out some of those dungeon

02:33:54.732 --> 02:33:59.227
tiles in this game in the near future. But if you
haven't checked it out yet, I recommend it! Go and

02:33:59.227 --> 02:34:02.450
see if you can back it. Those guys are awesome,
the quality of their work is great! All of you DMs

02:34:02.450 --> 02:34:08.093
out there that wanna run some seriously legit
dungeon setups for your miniatures and battle

02:34:08.093 --> 02:34:12.525
circumstances, it's highly recommended. So go
check that out. I know I've already backed it, so

02:34:12.525 --> 02:34:17.884
come join me! And (evil voice) one of us, one of
us! Anyway, does anyone else have something they

02:34:17.884 --> 02:34:19.648
wanna talk about for the evening, guys?

02:34:19.648 --> 02:34:20.426
ZAC: I do.

02:34:20.426 --> 02:34:21.764
MATT: Zac! What's up, buddy?

02:34:21.764 --> 02:34:26.281
ZAC: Thanks for tuning in, guys. I wanted to bring
up International Tabletop Day.

02:34:26.343 --> 02:34:27.861
MATT: Yes! Yes! Let's do that!

02:34:27.861 --> 02:34:34.422
ZAC: It's coming up on April 11th. We're going to
be live-streaming Tabletop Day from here in this

02:34:34.422 --> 02:34:41.770
studio. Probably not as complicated a setup as
this, but similar of a set up. For those of you

02:34:41.770 --> 02:34:49.001
that have not registered yet for International
Tabletop Day, go to the website tabletopday.com or

02:34:49.062 --> 02:34:52.557
org, I could be saying it wrong, the chat room
will let you know.

02:34:52.557 --> 02:34:53.503
MARISHA: Just google it.

02:34:53.503 --> 02:34:54.402
ZAC: Google it!

02:34:54.402 --> 02:34:55.861
MATT: Angelfire.tabletopday.com

02:34:55.861 --> 02:34:59.576
ZAC: I knew you were testing my knowledge! You're
saying it wrong, you're saying it wrong. I'm not

02:34:59.576 --> 02:35:05.278
an actor, dammit! So go check that out. We're
still looking for a lot of countries to have

02:35:05.278 --> 02:35:11.253
representation, so if you're overseas, go to the
website, let your local retailers know about it,

02:35:11.253 --> 02:35:16.289
sign up, and get in on the fun! It's going to be a
blast. We're going to have this whole building

02:35:16.289 --> 02:35:20.704
stacked to the brim with people! Board games, live
streaming the whole thing.

02:35:20.704 --> 02:35:22.530
Get in on it. It's going to be a lot of fun!

02:35:22.530 --> 02:35:23.731
MATT: Yeah, do it!

02:35:23.731 --> 02:35:26.661
ZAC: So I think that's pretty much it, thanks so
much guys.

02:35:26.661 --> 02:35:30.349
MATT: Yeah, no worries, I think next week we're
gonna try and do a Q&amp;amp;A after the game. So we'll

02:35:30.349 --> 02:35:31.789
stay for an hour or more after.

02:35:31.789 --> 02:35:32.825
ZAC: Subs only!

02:35:32.825 --> 02:35:33.920
MATT: Subs only! You get to hang out.

02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:37.329
ZAC: Subs only, so if you want to ask questions
next week after the show,

02:35:37.329 --> 02:35:39.205
make sure you subscribe.

02:35:39.205 --> 02:35:40.157
MATT: Yes! Do it!

02:35:40.157 --> 02:35:43.200
ZAC: Do it. Yeah, that's pretty much it, man.

02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:47.040
MATT: Hell yeah, awesome! Well, thanks
again, guys, for tuning in to Critical Role.

02:35:47.113 --> 02:35:49.636
Spread the love, tell your friends about it, all
come back and join in the story, and we'll have

02:35:49.636 --> 02:35:52.124
more fun next week, so. See you next Thursday.

02:35:52.124 --> 02:35:53.148
(all cheer)

02:35:53.148 --> 02:35:58.007
ZAC: Tune in tomorrow for So You Don't Have To,
where Becca and Hector play the worst games they

02:35:58.007 --> 02:36:03.512
can find so you don't have to. And then Gather
your Party, where we play board games with our

02:36:03.512 --> 02:36:05.174
friends, and it's gonna be a lot of fun.

02:36:05.174 --> 02:36:06.008
MATT: Hell yeah.

02:36:06.008 --> 02:36:08.528
ZAC: All right, I'm gonna-- you guys can talk
amongst yourselves, I gotta run. I'm the only

02:36:08.528 --> 02:36:11.499
person here so I'm gonna run back, turn off the
stream. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

02:36:11.499 --> 02:36:15.786
MATT: (laughs) This guy, this guy. Guys, thanks
again, have a wonderful night, we'll see you soon.
