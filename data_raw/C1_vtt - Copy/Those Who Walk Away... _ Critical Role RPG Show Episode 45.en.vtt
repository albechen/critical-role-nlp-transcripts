00:00:00.086 --> 00:00:04.275
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:08.463
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. Hate you, Liam.

00:00:08.463 --> 00:00:10.154
(laughter)

00:00:10.154 --> 00:00:13.982
TRAVIS: That was good! Really nice. Some good
flavor on it.

00:00:13.982 --> 00:00:22.024
MATT: You'll never know. So anyway! Welcome new
folks. People who aren't new folks, welcome back.

00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:28.557
We have some announcements to get to real fast,
then we'll jump into the actual story proper here.

00:00:28.557 --> 00:00:34.049
But, yeah! So, first and foremost, I wanted to
give a big thanks and shout-out to Syrinscape, I

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:39.623
mentioned them in last week's game, I put together
my gaming playlists on their platform, and I'm

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:42.313
going to be trying them out tonight to make sure
everything works out cool, but their setup is

00:00:42.313 --> 00:00:46.228
fantastic and I'm really excited about being able
to overlap audio, and things fade in and out. If

00:00:46.228 --> 00:00:49.880
you haven't checked it out, and you want to
really amp up your tabletop gaming, it's

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.485
phenomenal. But they're not paying for this, I'm
really excited about it. So that's that,

00:00:56.485 --> 00:00:59.471
Syrinscape's awesome. Marisha, you want to talk
about Signal Boost?

00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:01.355
MARISHA: Yeah! The first epil-- episode.

00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:02.411
LAURA: Epilsode!

00:01:02.411 --> 00:01:03.580
MARISHA: The first epil, of--

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.424
TALIESIN: Epilay!

00:01:04.424 --> 00:01:09.789
MARISHA: Epil, epilay, epilogue. The first episode
of Signal Boost went live on Tuesday. Go check it

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:16.100
out on GeekandSundry.com. Go watch it, it's good
fun. And you should go watch it so we don't get

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.254
cancelled, and we'll keep making more episodes.

00:01:18.254 --> 00:01:19.443
LIAM: Is that how it works?

00:01:19.443 --> 00:01:20.412
MARISHA: Apparently!

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:22.068
MATT: Yeah, it's the weirdest thing.

00:01:22.068 --> 00:01:23.098
MARISHA: It's crazy.

00:01:23.098 --> 00:01:24.175
LAURA: They care about that?

00:01:24.175 --> 00:01:27.479
MARISHA: Yeah. And I talk about Rat Queens, in it,
and--

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.512
LAURA: Yes! I saw! It's so good, Marisha. It's
really funny.

00:01:30.512 --> 00:01:34.425
TALIESIN: It's like ten minutes of your-- you have
more minutes than two minutes, spend a couple of

00:01:34.425 --> 00:01:35.401
minutes.

00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:41.082
MARISHA: And I tell you about cool things that I
like. That I picked out myself. My favorite

00:01:41.082 --> 00:01:42.415
things. Done.

00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:48.346
MATT: Watch it. It's good. All right. Next thing I
wanted to announce for you guys, tonight's

00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:54.039
donations, and all donations for the week, are
going to be going, as opposed to 826 overall, are

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.170
going to go to 826Seattle specifically, to
Fearless Ideas, is what it's called there, their

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.110
section up there, you can go to FearlessIdeas.org.
This past week there was a terrible gas explosion

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.583
in Seattle, you may have seen on the news, and it
did a lot of damage to that vicinity, including

00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:13.058
Fearless Ideas, and they've had to cancel a bunch
of their stuff, and they're trying to get things

00:02:13.058 --> 00:02:15.979
repaired and going. So all of our donations this
evening will be going towards them and helping

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:22.909
them get that effort taken care of. So think good
thoughts and help out if you can. Let's see.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.242
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Love you, Seattle!

00:02:25.242 --> 00:02:32.864
MATT: 826. We've, next Friday, in Anaheim, at
WonderCon, Friday night, we'll be doing a Critical

00:02:32.864 --> 00:02:37.017
Role panel, from 7:00 to 8:00pm, in Room 515A.

00:02:37.017 --> 00:02:39.194
LAURA: Wait, are we supposed to be at that?

00:02:39.194 --> 00:02:44.828
MATT: Next Friday. Next Friday. But most of us
will be there for that panel. We'll be doing a

00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:49.561
Q&amp;amp;A, answering questions, talking about the show,
for all the folks that are local or coming to that

00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:53.366
convention in the Anaheim area of southern
California. So, look forward to seeing you there,

00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:54.781
next Friday.

00:02:54.781 --> 00:03:00.067
LAURA: Yes, that's when we-- I can't say. I'll
talk to you guys afterwards.

00:03:00.067 --> 00:03:05.709
MATT: (laughs) Okay. We'll go over that. Mystery--
secret, I like it.

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.294
LAURA: Secret, secret.

00:03:07.294 --> 00:03:10.565
MATT: Wanted to give another shout-out to Dwarven
Forge again, I mentioned them last week. You got

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:14.812
to get a glimpse of some of the map stuff they
gave us here at Critical Role to help improve our

00:03:14.812 --> 00:03:20.395
battle mats and scenarios on occasion. Their new
Castle Builder Kickstarter is phenomenal, and if

00:03:20.395 --> 00:03:25.285
you're looking to do big structures and cool
castle-based ramparts and parapets and everything,

00:03:25.285 --> 00:03:27.478
go check it out, it might be right up your alley.

00:03:27.478 --> 00:03:28.782
TRAVIS: So pretty.

00:03:28.782 --> 00:03:37.292
MATT: So pretty. It's so pretty. Also, Laura,
if you want to announce, we have some new merch up

00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:38.504
in the store!

00:03:38.504 --> 00:03:44.236
LAURA: Go check GeekandSundry.com, go to their
store, right now, because they're up, and it's so

00:03:44.236 --> 00:03:48.449
awesome, and I can't wait for you guys to see, we
have a Gilmore's Glorious Goods t-shirt.

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.485
(cheering)

00:03:50.485 --> 00:03:54.323
LAURA: And I've been so excited about this shirt
coming out, I can't wait to wear it, why aren't we

00:03:54.323 --> 00:03:55.894
wearing it right now?

00:03:55.894 --> 00:04:00.116
MATT: (Gilmore voice) "Don't worry. Trust me, it's
a fabulous shirt. Some would even say it's quite

00:04:00.116 --> 00:04:01.259
"glorious."

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.130
TRAVIS: Oh my god, oh my god.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.407
LAURA: As well as the Gilmore's Glorious Goods
t-shirts, we also have exclusive Critical Role d20

00:04:07.407 --> 00:04:12.797
rings, spinny rings. Those are limited, so if you
get them, then snag them fast, because they're

00:04:12.797 --> 00:04:13.952
going to be gone.

00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:15.410
TRAVIS: We get one of those before they disappear,
right?

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.272
LAURA: I think they said they were going to set us
aside some, they'd better.

00:04:17.272 --> 00:04:22.613
TRAVIS: They are. They're bitchin'. You spin it,
the 20 is the Critical Role logo.

00:04:22.613 --> 00:04:26.797
LAURA: Why don't we have them right now?! At
intermission, maybe we can grab them at

00:04:26.797 --> 00:04:28.082
intermission.

00:04:28.082 --> 00:04:30.799
TRAVIS: They're sick.

00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:35.656
MATT: For those who don't know what those are,
the d20 spin rings, or spin rings in general,

00:04:35.656 --> 00:04:39.060
they're actually two separate moving pieces with
ball bearings on the inside, and you have all

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.158
numbers one through 20 on the actual ring, and you
can spin it with your finger, and it acts like a

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:44.199
die roll!

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:49.684
LAURA: And the d20, when you crit succeed, it's a
Critical Role logo. Just putting that out there.

00:04:49.684 --> 00:04:51.633
TRAVIS: You can do all your life decisions based
off a ring.

00:04:51.633 --> 00:04:53.018
MATT: What could possibly go wrong?

00:04:53.018 --> 00:04:55.347
LIAM: You still can die from them, though, just to
be clear.

00:04:55.347 --> 00:04:56.563
TALIESIN: Roll a one.

00:04:56.563 --> 00:04:59.141
MARISHA: And we are not held responsible if that
happens.

00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:01.974
TRAVIS: You go straight to Craven Edge.

00:05:01.974 --> 00:05:06.026
LIAM: It's appropriately called a "die."

00:05:06.026 --> 00:05:07.306
LAURA: Whatever.

00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:12.558
MATT: Liam!

00:05:12.558 --> 00:05:13.676
LIAM: Yeah?

00:05:13.676 --> 00:05:15.076
MATT: You wanted to--

00:05:15.076 --> 00:05:18.198
LIAM: Sure, I could talk about a couple of things.
Hey, a quick shout-out for our neighbor, Ivan van

00:05:18.198 --> 00:05:23.487
Norman's Kickstarter, The ABCs of RPGs, has three
days left. I backed it immediately, because I like

00:05:23.487 --> 00:05:28.017
D&amp;amp;D and I have kids, and you put those two things
together and good things happen. So that's good,

00:05:28.017 --> 00:05:33.646
three days left. Also, hey, if you like to put
your dice in boxes, I tell you what. Wyrmwood

00:05:33.646 --> 00:05:40.699
Gaming make beautiful boxes, and if you go over to
their site and you use the code critrole.

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.974
ALL: Crit. Role.

00:05:43.974 --> 00:05:46.987
LIAM: There it is. You get free shipping, they're
beautiful, they have all different kinds of woods

00:05:46.987 --> 00:05:56.673
to put your dice inside. Is there anything else?
Oh, yeah! Oh, okay. Yeah, hey, some of us, not all

00:05:56.673 --> 00:06:03.580
of us, are going to be going up to San Fran later
this month to make appearances on GameSpot's show

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:10.727
The Lobby for a couple of segments, and then, also
then hopping over to hang with the guys at Kinda

00:06:10.727 --> 00:06:13.261
Funny to play D&amp;amp;D.

00:06:13.261 --> 00:06:15.262
LAURA: Those guys are stupid.

00:06:15.262 --> 00:06:19.066
MATT: Which, a few of us will be running a quick
little one-shot game I'll be running with the aid

00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:26.703
of one of their local gentlemen. And it
should be a ridiculously ridiculous time! And

00:06:26.703 --> 00:06:27.780
it'll be a lot of fun.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.227
LIAM: And I'm curious to see, because there's
going to be two DMs, in sort of a Batman and

00:06:30.227 --> 00:06:32.210
Robin-type relationship kind of thing?

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.161
MATT: Oh yeah. We got plans. I've co-DM'd
before, it can be very interesting. And very

00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:37.678
chaotic. I'm excited.

00:06:37.678 --> 00:06:39.494
TRAVIS: Going to kill everybody.

00:06:39.494 --> 00:06:40.658
MATT: Probably.

00:06:40.658 --> 00:06:47.117
LAURA: This has nothing to do with announcements,
but I want to only roll green dice tonight. For

00:06:47.117 --> 00:06:48.601
Saint Patrick's Day.

00:06:48.601 --> 00:06:52.433
MARISHA: That's a good idea, I've got a set of
green dice. I'll get them out. Sure.

00:06:52.433 --> 00:06:55.318
TRAVIS: That's stupid. I have gray-ass dice and a
blue one.

00:06:55.318 --> 00:06:56.930
MARISHA: Got to get them all out.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.573
MATT: This is technically light green, guys, by
the way, just so you're aware. Cool. Just making

00:07:00.573 --> 00:07:02.406
sure we're all cool on that.

00:07:02.406 --> 00:07:04.224
TRAVIS: Plus the underwear you're wearing.

00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:05.972
MATT: Shh, that's just for you.

00:07:05.972 --> 00:07:09.444
LIAM: Travis and I are wearing green snake shirts,
because (Irish accent) Saint Patrick drove the

00:07:09.444 --> 00:07:13.152
snakes out of Ireland, into Burbank.

00:07:13.152 --> 00:07:15.669
MATT: Drove the Slytherin from Ireland. He got rid
of them all.

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:17.636
TRAVIS: Yeah. I took the Floo network.

00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:19.954
MARISHA: And I got this in Ireland, so it counts.

00:07:19.954 --> 00:07:21.628
LAURA: It kind of counts, Marisha.

00:07:21.628 --> 00:07:22.942
MARISHA: It counts.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:24.853
LIAM: (Irish accent) It's fucking Irish wool!

00:07:24.853 --> 00:07:26.306
MARISHA: And this is green.

00:07:26.306 --> 00:07:28.665
TRAVIS: Yeah, made from real Irish cats.

00:07:28.665 --> 00:07:34.815
MATT: They are the best, aren't they? Last but not
least, unless anyone else has any other

00:07:34.815 --> 00:07:36.900
announcements to make, anything else?

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:45.254
TALIESIN: Oh! I got a quick one, Book of Murder
came out today, so you can hear me do a very weird

00:07:45.254 --> 00:07:49.227
accent, it's great. So. Yes. Very weird accent.

00:07:49.227 --> 00:07:55.948
MATT: And last, next week, we'll have a special
guest joining us for an episode, a new guest, the

00:07:55.948 --> 00:08:00.514
intrepid Nerdist himself, Chris Hardwick, will be
coming in for a game next week.

00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:02.616
(cheering)

00:08:02.616 --> 00:08:08.889
MATT: Oh, I'm excited! We made his character this
past Monday, and it should be a lot of fun. He's

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:13.186
actually fun to game with. We've played D&amp;amp;D a
couple times, and he'll be a good addition to the

00:08:13.186 --> 00:08:16.731
team for his brief stop by. So next week, come
check him out on our show!

00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:18.336
TRAVIS: Uh-oh, what does that mean?

00:08:18.336 --> 00:08:20.721
MATT: So thanks for coming, Chris. I don't know,
it'll be fun.

00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:22.559
TALIESIN: Cleric, is what it means.

00:08:22.559 --> 00:08:25.490
MATT: Hoping every guest is a cleric. Just in
case.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.378
TRAVIS: Save us! From ourselves.

00:08:28.378 --> 00:08:33.831
MATT: All right, then. Without further ado, unless
you guys have anything else, we'll go ahead and

00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:37.940
hop into a quick synopsis of where we are in
Critical Role.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.276
LIAM: Shit. Help. Help. Help. Help.

00:08:40.276 --> 00:08:43.138
MATT: Sam will be here shortly, guys, don't freak
out. He's dealing with children and traffic.

00:08:43.138 --> 00:08:44.871
TALIESIN: Not at the same time.

00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:48.144
MARISHA: Damn it, you beat me to it. I was going
to say those two aren't mutually exclusive.

00:08:48.144 --> 00:08:50.902
Children and traffic.

00:08:50.902 --> 00:08:57.417
MATT: So. Where we left off. The party of Vox
Machina, having to deal with the current terrible

00:08:57.417 --> 00:09:02.519
danger of the Chroma Conclave, a collection of
very dangerous dragons that have torn through the

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:08.277
entire Tal'Dorei countryside, have then gone on
this quest to collect allies, and find these items

00:09:08.277 --> 00:09:13.747
called the Vestiges of Divergence, these artifacts
of ancient wars that carry great power and seem to

00:09:13.747 --> 00:09:17.519
be the best way you could prepare yourselves for
going up against these terrifyingly powerful

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:24.638
entities. In searching for this, you went and made
your way to Vasselheim, where you reacquired and

00:09:24.638 --> 00:09:29.336
reestablished friendships with Zahra and Kashaw,
two allies from previous instalments of our

00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:36.816
wondrous adventure, as well as getting Lady Kima
on loan from the Platinum Sanctuary of Bahamut,

00:09:36.816 --> 00:09:41.338
and you all went to seek the first bit of
information you discovered about one of these

00:09:41.338 --> 00:09:48.741
vestiges, not too far from Vasselheim. The
champion of the Raven Queen's armor that had been

00:09:48.741 --> 00:09:53.531
entombed within this temple that had sunken
beneath a lake. After traveling to this lake,

00:09:53.531 --> 00:10:00.019
finding your way through this subterranean, watery
location, you found the location of the tomb, upon

00:10:00.019 --> 00:10:07.077
which, a series of fish creatures, called kuo-toa,
had seemingly been worshiping another denizen of

00:10:07.077 --> 00:10:14.119
this temple, a rather strange slime-covered
beholder, that then surprised the party. The

00:10:14.119 --> 00:10:21.714
battle hard-fought, you came out victorious, and
upon going to retrieve your spoils, a trap was set

00:10:21.714 --> 00:10:30.757
off in the tomb, dodged by one, survived by a
bear, and claimed the life of our beloved

00:10:30.757 --> 00:10:38.491
Vex'ahlia. After a resurrection ritual attempted
by Kashaw, the party helping, they were successful

00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:44.717
in bringing her soul back from the other side,
restoring her to life, and the party then,

00:10:44.717 --> 00:10:50.454
figuring out what their next step in their journey
was, took their new allies, via Keyleth's

00:10:50.454 --> 00:10:54.915
Teleportation via Plants spell, back to
Whitestone, which seems to be building as this

00:10:54.915 --> 00:11:02.405
defensive bastion, this currently not on the radar
of the Conclave location that needs defenses, and

00:11:02.405 --> 00:11:07.279
a good place to keep your allies at the time. And
that was where we left off, as you guys had just

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:09.296
stepped back into Whitestone.

00:11:09.296 --> 00:11:12.185
LAURA: We haven't actually slept yet, then.

00:11:12.185 --> 00:11:13.739
MATT: Nope!

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:15.100
LAURA: It's late.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.792
MARISHA: What time is it here?

00:11:16.792 --> 00:11:26.043
MATT: I'd say through the evening's travels--
Well, you guys slept all night the night before

00:11:26.043 --> 00:11:28.269
you went to the temple, the temple's probably
been--

00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:30.928
MARISHA: That's true, we did sleep, actually, we
camped out.

00:11:30.928 --> 00:11:32.782
LAURA: We did?

00:11:32.782 --> 00:11:36.003
MARISHA: Remember? You talked to Zahra, and I
talked to Kash? Then we slept.

00:11:36.003 --> 00:11:37.761
MATT: Yeah, you guys did camp out.

00:11:37.761 --> 00:11:41.532
LAURA: Oh. I didn't know if we camped, I thought
we talked.

00:11:41.532 --> 00:11:42.870
MATT: You talked.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.826
MARISHA: We at least chilled. I don't know.

00:11:44.826 --> 00:11:46.733
MATT: Regardless.
You found your way to Whitestone.

00:11:46.733 --> 00:11:53.431
We'll say for the sake of the current setting,
you've come in in a rather overcast mid-afternoon

00:11:53.431 --> 00:11:59.286
in Whitestone, you may have spent some time there
gathering yourselves as your allies scope out

00:11:59.286 --> 00:12:04.291
their new surroundings, the people of Whitestone
accepting you as you arrive, you can always see

00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:09.839
people walking by and catching a glance at the
group of heroes known as Vox Machina that helped

00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:12.685
liberate them from the oppressive Briarwoods not
long ago.

00:12:12.685 --> 00:12:14.308
TALIESIN: Keep crawling out of trees.

00:12:14.308 --> 00:12:18.523
MARISHA: It's always weird. Not crawling out of
trees, that people like us.

00:12:18.523 --> 00:12:23.728
TRAVIS: Should we inspect our spoils?

00:12:23.728 --> 00:12:29.254
TALIESIN: I was going to say, we should take the
armor and the necklace to the castle and have it

00:12:29.254 --> 00:12:30.967
inspected.

00:12:30.967 --> 00:12:32.724
LAURA: Is Lady Allura here?

00:12:32.724 --> 00:12:35.328
MATT: Kima, who is with you, is like, "Is she?"

00:12:35.328 --> 00:12:44.011
LAURA: No. Well, she was on her way to Westruun,
and we haven't heard from her yet.

00:12:44.011 --> 00:12:45.241
TALIESIN: No.

00:12:45.241 --> 00:12:49.637
MATT: "Haven't heard from her since-- You say
Westruun was under attack as well?"

00:12:49.637 --> 00:12:52.783
LAURA: Yes, but she knew it. She was going in
secret.

00:12:52.783 --> 00:12:58.020
MATT: "That prideful woman." She slings her hammer
off her shoulder and slams it to the ground and

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:02.220
says, "Well. If she doesn't arrive in the next few
hours, I'm going to gather a party and we're going

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.128
"to go to Westruun and find her."

00:13:04.128 --> 00:13:05.165
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:13:05.165 --> 00:13:06.863
MARISHA: Kima-- Wait, what? Why?

00:13:06.863 --> 00:13:12.381
LAURA: Wait, there's a dragon there, Kima, a very
large one, and she was being very, very

00:13:12.381 --> 00:13:13.687
stealthy--

00:13:13.687 --> 00:13:18.999
MATT: Her hammer slams into her metallic armor, and
she goes, "I've a much bigger dragon backing me up."

00:13:19.163 --> 00:13:21.343
And she looks up to the sky for a second and
grins.

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:23.725
TRAVIS: Lady Kima don't give a fuck.

00:13:23.852 --> 00:13:27.142
LAURA: We'll wait, Kima.

00:13:27.142 --> 00:13:29.723
MATT: (frustrated sigh)

00:13:29.723 --> 00:13:32.989
LAURA: Going in loud will only cause more
trouble.

00:13:32.989 --> 00:13:36.917
MATT: "I'll wait a few days."

00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:40.039
LAURA: She should be here by then.

00:13:40.039 --> 00:13:43.870
MARISHA: I can always attempt to scry, and see if
I can check in on her.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:47.512
MATT: "Okay. Not a bad idea."

00:13:47.512 --> 00:13:48.771
MARISHA: Okay.

00:13:48.771 --> 00:13:51.073
MATT: "Okay. I need a drink."

00:13:51.073 --> 00:13:53.569
MARISHA: Let's get somewhere safe.

00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:55.770
MATT: She charges off, looking for the nearest
tavern.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:14:02.350
MARISHA: Here, I guess. I don't know. I forget
it's not overrun by vampires, I'm sorry. Sorry, I

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.585
forgot; it's all right now.

00:14:03.585 --> 00:14:05.697
LAURA: Maybe somewhere safe, like right here--

00:14:05.697 --> 00:14:08.457
MARISHA: Like right here, sorry, there's a lot
going on.

00:14:08.457 --> 00:14:13.978
MATT: Zahra and Kashaw looking around expectantly
as you continue this conversation. Kash crosses

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:23.574
his arms, goes, "Great place. There's a lot of
white." Of which Zahra comes and steps over and is

00:14:23.618 --> 00:14:28.774
like, "Don't worry, darling. (laughter) So,
sleeping arrangements, I hope?"

00:14:28.774 --> 00:14:31.142
LAURA: Yes, the castle.

00:14:31.142 --> 00:14:32.979
TALIESIN: We'll be putting you up in the castle.

00:14:32.979 --> 00:14:36.012
MATT: "That's what I like to hear. All right. To
the castle, Kash?"

00:14:36.012 --> 00:14:42.439
"Sure. It's better than, well,
it's better than anything.

00:14:42.439 --> 00:14:45.303
"Let's go for the
castle." And they both make their way towards

00:14:45.303 --> 00:14:50.183
Whitestone Castle, to find a comfortable place to
get themselves situated in their new

00:14:50.183 --> 00:14:51.871
surroundings.

00:14:51.871 --> 00:14:58.499
LAURA: So we're healed up, we are healed, we are
not running the risk of dying at any moment,

00:14:58.499 --> 00:15:00.349
because we've been healed.

00:15:00.349 --> 00:15:02.578
MATT: What is that? What is that blur of green?

00:15:02.578 --> 00:15:04.237
TRAVIS: It's a fucking leprechaun, get it!

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:05.806
SAM: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:15:05.806 --> 00:15:07.439
LIAM: You should be.

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:10.322
MARISHA: Your shirt, is that new? Because I love
it so much.

00:15:10.322 --> 00:15:13.303
SAM: Thanks! But I'm also wearing a tie because
it's a special night.

00:15:13.303 --> 00:15:14.942
LAURA: Right. It's a special occasion.

00:15:14.942 --> 00:15:18.037
SAM: (sighs) So, is Allura dead?

00:15:18.037 --> 00:15:21.162
(laughter)

00:15:21.162 --> 00:15:22.881
TRAVIS: Kima just left, so--

00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:27.433
LAURA: She's on her way to a tavern. Kima's
drinking it up. Grog! Kima's drinking it up.

00:15:27.433 --> 00:15:29.210
MARISHA: Are we heading to a tavern?

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.422
TALIESIN: We're heading to the castle. We're going
to talk to friends, we're going to take a look at--

00:15:32.422 --> 00:15:34.027
TRAVIS: Corpse armor, hello.

00:15:34.027 --> 00:15:35.429
MARISHA: Oh, corpse armor.

00:15:35.429 --> 00:15:38.507
TRAVIS: Yeah. You know, the thing that almost
killed our friend over here?

00:15:38.507 --> 00:15:40.676
LAURA: It did kill me. According to you.

00:15:40.676 --> 00:15:42.004
TALIESIN: It-- yes.

00:15:42.004 --> 00:15:48.577
TRAVIS: Yeah, but, I mean, you're here, so you
didn't die. But you did. But you didn't. But you

00:15:48.577 --> 00:15:50.930
did. And then you didn't.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:51.999
LAURA: Thanks, Grog.

00:15:51.999 --> 00:15:52.997
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:15:52.997 --> 00:15:58.337
MATT: All right, so. You guys all heading to the
castle?

00:15:58.337 --> 00:15:59.446
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:15:59.446 --> 00:16:04.612
MATT: You head to the castle. Cassandra isn't there
at the moment, but Keeper Yennen is currently

00:16:04.612 --> 00:16:11.626
there with a few other members of the makeshift
council you guys put together towards the end. One

00:16:11.661 --> 00:16:14.532
of the heads of the entire farming establishment
here in Whitestone is with them, and they're

00:16:14.532 --> 00:16:21.063
having a conversation. As Zahra and Kashaw burst
in first, he's like, "I'm sorry, we're not

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:27.462
"currently taking visitors, could you-- Oh. Friends
of yours, I presume?"

00:16:27.462 --> 00:16:28.729
TALIESIN: Good friends.

00:16:28.729 --> 00:16:33.266
LAURA: Helpers, actually. They're going to be here
for a while. Hopefully.

00:16:33.266 --> 00:16:41.617
MATT: "Gracious. Oh, I see you yourself carry the
vestments of a man of the cloth. Who brings your

00:16:41.617 --> 00:16:43.051
"power this day?"

00:16:43.051 --> 00:16:47.986
Kashaw gives him a look and goes, "You don't even
want to know, buddy." Walks past him.

00:16:47.986 --> 00:16:49.784
TALIESIN: That was a really good Kashaw.

00:16:49.784 --> 00:16:53.192
MATT: "Very well! I assume they're staying here as
well."

00:16:53.192 --> 00:16:56.362
TALIESIN: Yes. We appreciate it greatly.

00:16:56.362 --> 00:16:58.648
MATT: "They'll be taken care of, Percival."

00:16:58.648 --> 00:17:06.528
TALIESIN: They will be well worth your time. We
also have something that needs a bit of study. We

00:17:06.528 --> 00:17:11.660
found something. We found two objects of power
that we think may help us turn the table against

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.927
the dragons.

00:17:12.927 --> 00:17:13.980
LAURA: Two objects?

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.004
MATT: "This is good news."

00:17:15.004 --> 00:17:15.789
TALIESIN: Two objects.

00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:16.713
LAURA: What was the second?

00:17:16.713 --> 00:17:17.680
TALIESIN: There was a necklace.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.565
LAURA: There was?

00:17:18.565 --> 00:17:19.320
TALIESIN: There was.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.202
SAM: You were dead.

00:17:20.202 --> 00:17:22.705
LAURA: Oh. I must have missed it because I was
dead. That's right.

00:17:22.705 --> 00:17:23.818
MATT: "Dead?!"

00:17:23.818 --> 00:17:25.654
TALIESIN: It's been a very long day.

00:17:25.654 --> 00:17:26.939
SAM: Mostly dead.

00:17:26.939 --> 00:17:30.865
MARISHA: Be very careful when handling this armor,
is what we're trying to say.

00:17:30.865 --> 00:17:32.814
TRAVIS: Or don't handle it, and we'll take care of
it.

00:17:32.814 --> 00:17:34.571
MATT: "So, the armor is what killed you?"

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:38.784
LAURA: No, actually, a trap that Percival set off
is what killed me.

00:17:38.784 --> 00:17:40.559
TALIESIN: Yes, the--

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.578
LIAM: What?

00:17:42.578 --> 00:17:48.355
TALIESIN: -- trap was a bit-- it was a bit, ah--
there was a trap. And it was well-protected.

00:17:48.355 --> 00:17:50.881
LIAM: What?

00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:52.866
LAURA: What, what, what? What?

00:17:52.866 --> 00:17:53.941
TALIESIN: Yes, what.

00:17:53.941 --> 00:17:54.792
LAURA: What?

00:17:54.792 --> 00:17:56.392
TRAVIS: (mutters) He didn't know that.

00:17:56.392 --> 00:17:58.251
LAURA: What? So these Vestiges.

00:17:58.251 --> 00:18:00.043
MATT: "Vestiges."

00:18:00.043 --> 00:18:03.267
LAURA: These leathers, these things.

00:18:03.267 --> 00:18:10.557
MATT: "Um--" And he puts a couple of small,
armored, like, studded-leather gloves on and has

00:18:10.557 --> 00:18:17.378
to carefully reach out for the vestments as you
hand them. And he grabs them. "Give me a bit of

00:18:17.378 --> 00:18:24.795
"time with them, perhaps, I need to clarify what
this enchantment may be. Do you mind staying

00:18:24.795 --> 00:18:26.314
"around, just in case?"

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:27.705
TALIESIN: Not at all.

00:18:27.705 --> 00:18:32.817
MATT: "Don't feel strange that I don't trust this,
but, based on your history with it, I would like a

00:18:32.817 --> 00:18:39.524
"little backup." So, he carries you off down the
far hallway, you didn't get this far into

00:18:39.524 --> 00:18:44.104
Whitestone when you initially came through, but
towards the back there was a small study area

00:18:44.104 --> 00:18:49.667
converted into a research establishment largely
set up for the ziggurat beneath the city. He

00:18:49.667 --> 00:18:54.617
clears off an area of the table and sets this
down. And he takes some time working with the

00:18:54.617 --> 00:19:01.694
vestments before he eventually, and it's this
awkward quiet of hearing him mutter to himself and

00:19:01.694 --> 00:19:08.217
bring out a symbol and bring over a minor
enchantment to reveal information, that tearing

00:19:08.217 --> 00:19:17.019
into the divinity, the divine magic that is
granted to him, before he says, "This carries the

00:19:17.019 --> 00:19:27.677
"mark of the Raven Queen, a very strong mark. I've
not seen power like this in but an object."

00:19:27.677 --> 00:19:32.243
LAURA: It was worn by one of her champions. The
great Purvan.

00:19:32.243 --> 00:19:34.938
MATT: "That's a strange name."

00:19:34.938 --> 00:19:35.975
LAURA: Yeah.

00:19:35.975 --> 00:19:46.863
MATT: "Regardless, it appears that this armor does
help fortify one's defenses from any sort of

00:19:46.863 --> 00:19:54.272
"physical damage, as well as give you a chance of
surviving even the most dangerous of near-death

00:19:54.272 --> 00:20:07.616
"experiences. It also grants a fluid resistance to
the elements. Here."

00:20:07.616 --> 00:20:11.417
And he hands it over, and-- who would like to take
this? Item card to--

00:20:11.417 --> 00:20:13.105
TRAVIS: Well, you died for it, you--

00:20:13.105 --> 00:20:15.352
LAURA: I think I like it, but I'll just look at
it.

00:20:15.352 --> 00:20:16.389
MARISHA: It's leather?

00:20:16.389 --> 00:20:17.381
LAURA: It's leather.

00:20:17.381 --> 00:20:22.297
MATT: So, to give you the specifics on it, it's
plus two to AC. Magical on top of the studded

00:20:22.297 --> 00:20:27.849
leather armor. Plus two enchantment, beyond just
the studded leather armor. It does give you

00:20:27.849 --> 00:20:30.446
advantage on death saving throws.

00:20:30.446 --> 00:20:31.833
SAM: You'll need that.

00:20:31.833 --> 00:20:38.852
MATT: As it is called the Deathwalker's Ward, and
once per short rest, you can set it to be

00:20:38.852 --> 00:20:42.813
resistant to one of the five types of damage.

00:20:42.813 --> 00:20:44.263
LAURA: You choose which one.

00:20:44.263 --> 00:20:47.044
MATT: You choose. You can change it. You can leave
it all on one, but if you want to change it during

00:20:47.044 --> 00:20:50.815
a short rest, you can shift it from fire or cold,
or lightning--

00:20:50.815 --> 00:20:52.509
TRAVIS: Acid, or necrotic.

00:20:52.509 --> 00:20:54.390
SAM: You're, like, indestructible now!

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:58.700
MARISHA: Do you have fancy leather armor right
now? What does your armor do right now? Anything?

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.390
LIAM: It's acid-resistant.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:08.466
LAURA: My armor's acid-resistant, I sort of stole
it from my brother. Do you want your

00:21:08.466 --> 00:21:11.999
acid-resistant armor back, then?

00:21:11.999 --> 00:21:15.009
LIAM: Whatever you want, Vex'ahlia.

00:21:15.009 --> 00:21:18.940
LAURA: He's in such a sour mood lately.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:27.061
TRAVIS: Well, yeah. Well, what about the
necklace?

00:21:27.061 --> 00:21:30.750
MATT: "The necklace as well?"

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:34.407
TALIESIN: I hand it over.

00:21:34.407 --> 00:21:39.737
MATT: He takes it, and he goes, "Well, the chain
on this necklace is not actually part of the

00:21:39.737 --> 00:21:44.123
"enchantment, it's merely to hold the crystal
itself. The crystal is the item of particular

00:21:44.123 --> 00:21:49.769
"interest here, this-- oh, wait a minute." He takes
it and he scans over the table and pulls up a

00:21:49.769 --> 00:21:55.832
jeweler's eyepiece and inspects it closely.
"There's something inside this gem."

00:21:55.832 --> 00:21:56.889
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

00:21:56.889 --> 00:21:58.536
MARISHA: (groans) Not again.

00:21:58.536 --> 00:21:59.620
LAURA: What is it?

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.691
MARISHA: Why do things like living in gems? It
can't be comfortable.

00:22:03.691 --> 00:22:05.002
TRAVIS: It might be a worm.

00:22:05.002 --> 00:22:07.146
LAURA: It's like tequila.

00:22:07.146 --> 00:22:12.087
MATT: "I can't actually ascertain the nature of
whatever being is encased within this, but--"

00:22:12.087 --> 00:22:13.655
LAURA: There's a being, it's a being?

00:22:13.655 --> 00:22:14.800
MARISHA: Encased.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.091
LAURA: Is it a soul gem?

00:22:16.091 --> 00:22:18.551
MARISHA: Like something put it in there.

00:22:18.551 --> 00:22:22.824
MATT: He takes a moment and concentrates on his
holy symbol of Pelor, and you can see as he puts

00:22:22.824 --> 00:22:32.804
aside the eyepiece, his eyes glaze over with a
grayish, frosted white color, at which point he

00:22:32.804 --> 00:22:37.609
inspects the gem very closely, and there's this
slight vibration in the air around him. As soon as

00:22:37.609 --> 00:22:42.891
it fades about a minute later, he pulls back and
goes, "This is referred to as the Raven's Slumber.

00:22:42.891 --> 00:22:48.566
"It's actually a small gateway to a tiny
pocket-plane."

00:22:48.566 --> 00:22:50.724
SAM: A pocket-plane?

00:22:50.724 --> 00:22:51.824
MARISHA: Ooh.

00:22:51.824 --> 00:23:00.990
MATT: "It can contain one creature. You have to
contact whatever it was, and it can't be too big,

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:05.918
"but it can essentially contain something
indefinitely within this."

00:23:05.918 --> 00:23:07.514
LAURA: But something's already in there?

00:23:07.514 --> 00:23:09.079
MATT: "Something is already in this."

00:23:09.079 --> 00:23:11.267
TRAVIS: Awesome.

00:23:11.267 --> 00:23:13.250
SAM: Something that we can summon?

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.765
MARISHA: Any way we can find out what it possibly
is before we summon it?

00:23:16.765 --> 00:23:19.577
MATT: "Unfortunately, I do not have that
capability."

00:23:19.577 --> 00:23:21.262
LAURA: It was buried with--

00:23:21.262 --> 00:23:22.491
SAM: I'll take that.

00:23:22.491 --> 00:23:25.367
LAURA: Oh, that's really smart to give to
Scanlan.

00:23:25.367 --> 00:23:28.601
TRAVIS: Well, like, you said "not too big" though,
right?

00:23:28.601 --> 00:23:34.140
MATT: "The confines of the space, at least, as
part of the enchantment, seem rather small. A bit

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.802
"larger than you, maybe, but not much more than
that."

00:23:36.802 --> 00:23:38.355
TRAVIS: Right, right, okay.

00:23:38.355 --> 00:23:40.806
MATT: "Here."

00:23:40.806 --> 00:23:41.879
TRAVIS: Please.

00:23:41.879 --> 00:23:43.955
MARISHA: Well, does it change size?

00:23:43.955 --> 00:23:47.296
LAURA: This is maybe the worst thing that
Scanlan's ever held outside of that gun that you

00:23:47.296 --> 00:23:48.171
had, Percy.

00:23:48.171 --> 00:23:51.941
TRAVIS: What are you talking about? Can we take it
in the woods, open it up, and if it sucks we kill

00:23:51.941 --> 00:23:53.790
it, and if not, we've got a new pet.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:57.051
MARISHA: We don't even know how to open it up! Do
we know how to open it up?

00:23:57.051 --> 00:23:58.318
TRAVIS: Oh, we will find a way.

00:23:58.318 --> 00:24:03.040
LAURA: It was buried with the Raven Queen's
champion, I mean, it could be incredibly

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:08.162
dangerous. Or it could be incredibly good, and he
trapped it, and they're bad, right?

00:24:08.162 --> 00:24:11.089
LIAM: The same could be said about your new
pajamas.

00:24:11.089 --> 00:24:16.065
LAURA: They are so beautiful. I do like feathers.

00:24:16.065 --> 00:24:17.985
TRAVIS: What do they smell like?

00:24:17.985 --> 00:24:24.603
LAURA: (sniffs) Like (sniffs) must and mold. And
birds, really.

00:24:24.603 --> 00:24:26.997
TRAVIS: (laughing) And birds? Eesh.

00:24:26.997 --> 00:24:29.828
MATT: "So, is that all you require of me?"

00:24:29.828 --> 00:24:35.234
TRAVIS: I require Percy to tell us what the fuck's
up with the necklace he's reading about.

00:24:35.234 --> 00:24:37.270
TALIESIN: Just what he said.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:39.005
LAURA: Yeah, he already told us about it.

00:24:39.005 --> 00:24:44.283
SAM: Once we release whatever is inside of it, we
can use this necklace as a weapon, to--

00:24:44.283 --> 00:24:45.315
TALIESIN: It's a cage.

00:24:45.315 --> 00:24:46.659
SAM: To trap people.

00:24:46.659 --> 00:24:52.003
MARISHA: Hang on, okay. Let's think about this.
What do we remember from the great Purvan's

00:24:52.003 --> 00:24:53.320
story?

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.924
LAURA: Well, let me look at my book?

00:24:54.924 --> 00:24:56.189
MARISHA: What did he fight?

00:24:56.189 --> 00:25:02.309
SAM: I just remember that Purvan's story touched
me. Touched me in inappropriate ways.

00:25:02.309 --> 00:25:04.403
TRAVIS: (laughing) No, no, no.

00:25:04.403 --> 00:25:09.976
LAURA: You know what I like about this particular
piece of paper is that you made it on cardstock so

00:25:09.976 --> 00:25:12.806
it's extra special instead of the regular paper.

00:25:12.806 --> 00:25:14.109
MATT: It's legendary.

00:25:14.109 --> 00:25:15.749
TALIESIN: Legendary cardstock.

00:25:15.749 --> 00:25:17.814
MARISHA: Can we get purple cardstock up in here?

00:25:17.814 --> 00:25:24.421
LAURA: I'm talking to Matt, bitches. Okay. I
forgot what I was going to say-- Oh, my book! My

00:25:24.421 --> 00:25:27.339
30-gold book! Does it say anything about what
Purvan fought?

00:25:27.339 --> 00:25:31.440
MATT: All right! You read through. There were many,
many things throughout the war that were fought:

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:38.013
entities from the Nine Hells, there was a faction
of the Abyss that came in as a third bit of evil

00:25:38.013 --> 00:25:42.382
in this whole conflict; and while not in alliance
against the other forces of chaos, there were many

00:25:42.382 --> 00:25:48.155
forces of chaos lashing out at what was nearby. So
the Champion's-- there was no specific entity that

00:25:48.155 --> 00:25:53.927
was his chosen, or at least, what you can
ascertain to be a specific being of hatred,

00:25:53.927 --> 00:26:01.468
although it does speak of Purvan, the Champion of
the Raven Queen, keeping with him an ally.

00:26:01.468 --> 00:26:05.955
LAURA: Like Trinket.

00:26:05.955 --> 00:26:18.939
MATT: It doesn't say the nature of the ally, it
just says the dangerous and respected Galdric.

00:26:18.939 --> 00:26:21.117
LAURA: (gasps) Galdric.

00:26:21.117 --> 00:26:23.052
TALIESIN: Well, there are some options here.

00:26:23.052 --> 00:26:24.350
LAURA: What?

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.368
TALIESIN: No, that won't work, damn it.

00:26:26.368 --> 00:26:27.955
TRAVIS: Well, say it, come on.

00:26:27.955 --> 00:26:35.795
TALIESIN: Well, I was thinking we could find a
safe place, surround it, let it out, and if it's

00:26:35.795 --> 00:26:40.102
dangerous, take care of it. We could even take it
down into the pits beneath the castle so that if

00:26:40.102 --> 00:26:45.900
it's a magical creature, it would be harmless.
Except I don't know if we could actually release

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.193
it down there. I don't know--

00:26:47.193 --> 00:26:48.895
LAURA: Yeah, what if it touches the thing, and
it--

00:26:48.895 --> 00:26:50.439
SAM: There's also magic resistance down there.

00:26:50.439 --> 00:26:52.103
TALIESIN: Yeah, which means it wouldn't work in
the first place.

00:26:52.103 --> 00:26:54.464
MARISHA: What if he's friendly? I mean, he talks
about being an ally.

00:26:54.464 --> 00:26:55.638
TALIESIN: It might be an ally.

00:26:55.638 --> 00:26:57.345
MARISHA: Well then, wouldn't we want to save it?

00:26:57.345 --> 00:26:59.385
LAURA: An ally of Purvan! An ally of Purvan's!

00:26:59.385 --> 00:27:00.425
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:27:00.425 --> 00:27:01.817
LAURA: Is Purvan a good guy?

00:27:01.817 --> 00:27:02.731
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:27:02.731 --> 00:27:04.243
LAURA: I thought the Raven Queen was not good!

00:27:04.243 --> 00:27:05.488
TALIESIN: No, the Raven Queen--

00:27:05.488 --> 00:27:07.913
MARISHA: She's like-- neutral.

00:27:07.913 --> 00:27:09.665
TALIESIN: Can I make a roll for this?

00:27:09.665 --> 00:27:10.909
MATT: Make a religion check.

00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:13.261
TALIESIN: Okay, thank you. Nope, nope, it's St.
Patty's Day.

00:27:13.261 --> 00:27:16.167
TRAVIS: Don't kill anybody.

00:27:16.167 --> 00:27:17.763
LAURA: Yeah, with these green dice.

00:27:17.763 --> 00:27:18.910
TALIESIN: Religion or history?

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:19.977
MATT and TRAVIS: Religion.

00:27:19.977 --> 00:27:23.692
TALIESIN: 11.

00:27:23.692 --> 00:27:30.111
MATT: 11. The general essence of the Raven Queen:
she is both loved and feared in equal parts. She

00:27:30.111 --> 00:27:35.087
does not lord over the afterlife, the underworld,
whatever you may call it-- she lords over the

00:27:35.087 --> 00:27:40.582
moment and the transition of death, which is
largely considered neither a good nor evil, just a

00:27:40.582 --> 00:27:47.075
natural force. It could be accepted either way.
Many men fear it, and fear her for that reason,

00:27:47.075 --> 00:27:52.465
and there are those that instead embrace it as the
inevitable. As to the true nature of her intent,

00:27:52.465 --> 00:27:55.134
no one really knows. It's part of her mystique.

00:27:55.134 --> 00:28:02.220
TRAVIS: So, like, even if we let out the glorious
Ball-lick or whatever his name is, like, if he's

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:05.241
bad, we can't really put him back in, right?

00:28:05.241 --> 00:28:08.285
TALIESIN: No, we actually can. Actually, we can
put him back in.

00:28:08.285 --> 00:28:10.688
TRAVIS: What, we touch him with it and he goes
back in?

00:28:10.688 --> 00:28:11.771
SAM: Correct.

00:28:11.771 --> 00:28:13.195
MATT: After a saving throw.

00:28:13.195 --> 00:28:18.028
MARISHA: Maybe we should save him and release him
when he'll be valuable to us?

00:28:18.028 --> 00:28:20.933
TALIESIN: So would a trap. We could also trap
other creatures--

00:28:20.933 --> 00:28:25.665
LAURA: It's like a Poké Ball! Right? It's like a
Pokémon?

00:28:25.712 --> 00:28:27.545
TALIESIN: Yes, it's exactly like a Poké Ball.

00:28:27.545 --> 00:28:29.826
MARISHA: Who knows if he'll go back in willingly?

00:28:29.826 --> 00:28:31.483
TALIESIN: You don't have to go in willingly,
that's sort of the point.

00:28:31.483 --> 00:28:33.423
MATT: I guess you could technically use it that way,
yeah.

00:28:33.423 --> 00:28:39.441
MARISHA: But wouldn't we rather be friendly with
him than him be angry at us the next time we

00:28:39.441 --> 00:28:40.711
release him?

00:28:40.711 --> 00:28:43.488
TALIESIN: I'm more excited about the idea of
carrying around an empty trap.

00:28:43.488 --> 00:28:52.393
MARISHA: But we could win both. But we could have
a trap and a friend.

00:28:52.393 --> 00:28:56.484
LIAM: I think Percy is right that we should let it
out now because it's a question mark, no matter

00:28:56.484 --> 00:29:02.974
what. Whatever, it's all theories. We don't know
what we're getting into, and better that it pop

00:29:02.974 --> 00:29:07.114
out now, on its own, and not while we're facing a
fucking beholder.

00:29:07.114 --> 00:29:09.213
LAURA: I think we should do it in the forest
outside of Vasselheim.

00:29:09.213 --> 00:29:11.297
TALIESIN: Or the forest outside of Whitestone.

00:29:11.297 --> 00:29:12.862
SAM: Vasselheim? We're here.

00:29:12.862 --> 00:29:17.099
MARISHA: Why don't we try and do a little bit more
research on Galdric first?

00:29:17.131 --> 00:29:20.167
SAM: That would be too careful.

00:29:20.167 --> 00:29:23.942
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on. Come on.

00:29:23.942 --> 00:29:25.520
SAM: Vex! Just open it!

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:30.871
LIAM: Percival. Are there any libraries here?

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.182
TALIESIN: Not really, anymore.

00:29:33.182 --> 00:29:35.288
LIAM: What about a personal collection in your
family?

00:29:35.288 --> 00:29:40.563
TALIESIN: Didn't they ravage most of our
collection?

00:29:40.563 --> 00:29:43.885
MATT: Elements have been ravaged. Elements of
family history have been destroyed so that there

00:29:43.885 --> 00:29:52.047
couldn't be large connections, or the end of the
bloodline itself being too prominently displayed

00:29:52.047 --> 00:29:56.567
within the castle itself. There is still a library
there, though from your knowledge-- and you've

00:29:56.567 --> 00:29:59.962
read through most of those books growing up-- a
lot of them are loose history books; a lot of them

00:29:59.962 --> 00:30:04.179
are more encyclopedia-like, general knowledge--

00:30:04.179 --> 00:30:10.008
TALIESIN: She wasn't a revered deity in this part
of the world, we don't have a lot--

00:30:10.008 --> 00:30:13.402
LAURA: All right, yeah, let's do it. Woods!

00:30:13.402 --> 00:30:14.936
TRAVIS: Woods! Woods! Woods!

00:30:14.936 --> 00:30:17.908
TALIESIN: Woods, or Vasselheim, that's actually
not a bad idea to get far away from Whitestone.

00:30:17.908 --> 00:30:20.655
TRAVIS: No, because then somebody else'll come
along and kill it.

00:30:20.655 --> 00:30:22.010
SAM: Plus they don't like magic.

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:25.241
TALIESIN: This is sort of our secret, and we
should perhaps keep this--

00:30:25.241 --> 00:30:26.705
LAURA: Okay.

00:30:26.705 --> 00:30:30.495
TALIESIN: Well, we were going to go take a look
at--

00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:32.924
MARISHA: (muffled) What if--

00:30:32.924 --> 00:30:35.402
TRAVIS: You got shit in your mouth.

00:30:35.402 --> 00:30:40.358
MARISHA: We g-- mm, sorry. Little bit of saliva.

00:30:40.358 --> 00:30:41.845
LIAM: Goodberries?

00:30:41.845 --> 00:30:50.806
MARISHA: Snacks. We go to those goliath caves,
right outside of Whitestone, that were abandoned.

00:30:50.806 --> 00:30:52.274
TRAVIS: Stone giant caves?

00:30:52.274 --> 00:30:53.151
MARISHA: Those!

00:30:53.151 --> 00:30:57.979
TRAVIS: Shit. Made me feel like I had to poop for
a second, there. Goliath caves, fuck.

00:30:57.979 --> 00:31:04.359
MARISHA: Sorry! I just remembered you recognized
them. They were empty, and abandoned, we could go there.

00:31:04.359 --> 00:31:05.529
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:31:05.529 --> 00:31:07.398
LAURA: Is that close to your family?

00:31:07.398 --> 00:31:08.444
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:31:08.444 --> 00:31:10.269
MARISHA: No, we saw it on the way into
Whitestone.

00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:11.770
TALIESIN: It's just a couple hours away, correct?

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:12.535
LAURA: Oh.

00:31:12.535 --> 00:31:16.058
MATT: It's, I'd say roughly three, three and a
half hours northwest of here.

00:31:16.058 --> 00:31:17.478
LAURA: Let's do it!

00:31:17.478 --> 00:31:21.933
MATT: Yeah, it's where the forest of the Alabaster
Sierras ends and the actual Alabaster Sierra

00:31:21.933 --> 00:31:24.378
mountain range begins, is where that transitions.

00:31:24.378 --> 00:31:26.086
TALIESIN: We can take a day and do this.

00:31:26.086 --> 00:31:32.288
LAURA: All right, sure. Let's do it. All right.
What do you think? Good idea? Good idea?

00:31:32.288 --> 00:31:35.222
LIAM: Sure, yes, yes, yes, Keyleth had a good
idea, yes.

00:31:35.222 --> 00:31:38.843
MATT: All right. So.

00:31:38.843 --> 00:31:41.340
LAURA: We're healed, yes?

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.528
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:31:42.528 --> 00:31:45.122
MARISHA: We're healed, right? Did we sleep? Do we
need to sleep?

00:31:45.122 --> 00:31:49.020
LIAM: I thought we rested before we went down
under the water, though--

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.554
LAURA: No, we did, we didn't rest since then.

00:31:51.554 --> 00:31:55.162
LIAM: I don't remember resting afterwards. And I
was there.

00:31:55.162 --> 00:31:56.952
TRAVIS: I don't either. I remember I peed on a
lake, and then we went under it.

00:31:56.952 --> 00:31:59.285
MATT: Yeah, I think you guys decided instead of
resting to come to rest here in Whitestone.

00:31:59.285 --> 00:32:00.646
LAURA: Yeah, we need to sleep, y'all!

00:32:00.646 --> 00:32:02.554
TALIESIN: Let's take a sleep, and we'll do it in
the morning.

00:32:02.554 --> 00:32:03.749
TRAVIS: What time is it, about?

00:32:03.749 --> 00:32:07.182
MATT: I'd say by now, with as much time as you
spent in the temple, from waking up in the

00:32:07.182 --> 00:32:14.654
morning, it's getting four in the afternoon, five
in the afternoon. The sun's starting to come down, so.

00:32:14.654 --> 00:32:17.986
LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself.

00:32:17.986 --> 00:32:21.566
SAM: Aren't we going to sleep?

00:32:21.566 --> 00:32:24.492
LAURA: But it's four in the afternoon! There's
other things to do today.

00:32:24.492 --> 00:32:25.576
MARISHA: Like drink?

00:32:25.576 --> 00:32:28.503
LAURA: Like find out how Gilmore's doing and see
Pike.

00:32:28.503 --> 00:32:32.250
MARISHA: And I should probably scry and check in
on Allura, right?

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.567
TALIESIN: I've got some work to do.

00:32:33.567 --> 00:32:36.614
MATT: It's up to you guys. Yeah, and you're
starting to push towards the bottom of your

00:32:36.614 --> 00:32:38.450
ammunition stack anyway, Percy.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:41.599
TALIESIN: I need to, yeah, to do a little-- and
I've got a little thing I want to work on.

00:32:41.599 --> 00:32:43.530
MATT: Cool. All right, so, who's doing what
first?

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:49.420
TALIESIN: I'm going to take Vax aside very
quickly.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:57.195
TRAVIS: Let's do that first!

00:32:57.195 --> 00:33:04.010
TALIESIN: I had a careless moment, and I
apologize. And you're the first apology I'm

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:13.953
putting forward. I don't know if I would have done
anything different, but I hope you know that I

00:33:13.953 --> 00:33:16.766
would've never forgiven myself.

00:33:16.766 --> 00:33:19.263
LIAM: What're you talking about?

00:33:19.263 --> 00:33:25.067
TALIESIN: I rushed in and triggered the trap that
almost killed your sister.

00:33:25.067 --> 00:33:27.884
LIAM: That killed my sister.

00:33:27.884 --> 00:33:30.912
TALIESIN: I can't say that.

00:33:30.912 --> 00:33:34.407
LIAM: What do you mean?

00:33:34.407 --> 00:33:39.939
TALIESIN: I was careless.

00:33:39.939 --> 00:33:41.963
LIAM: Well, what happened, Percival?

00:33:41.963 --> 00:33:51.756
TALIESIN: I felt the danger had passed, and I
moved too quickly, and opened the casket without

00:33:51.756 --> 00:33:58.195
thinking. That's all. I just didn't think.

00:33:58.195 --> 00:34:09.730
LIAM: You just opened it? Just like that?

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:23.009
TALIESIN: I was tired, wasn't thinking. Sometimes
we move too quickly. But I want you to know that

00:34:23.009 --> 00:34:28.966
it would've-- I'm very glad that she's alive,
because I don't think I could have lived with

00:34:28.966 --> 00:34:30.465
myself.

00:34:30.465 --> 00:34:47.561
LIAM: All right. Could you do me a favor?

00:34:47.561 --> 00:34:50.676
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:34:50.676 --> 00:35:08.875
LIAM: In the future-- If there is anything that
your little heart desires inside of a box-- In the

00:35:08.875 --> 00:35:14.463
future, could you check with my sister or myself
first?

00:35:14.463 --> 00:35:31.843
TALIESIN: That's the hope, yes. That was more of a
lesson than I was hoping for. Thankfully not too

00:35:31.843 --> 00:35:34.535
much of one.

00:35:34.535 --> 00:35:36.437
LIAM: Well--

00:35:36.437 --> 00:35:42.823
TALIESIN: And none of us are beyond mistakes,
but... that is a mistake that I am going to be

00:35:42.823 --> 00:35:53.428
thinking about for a very long time. We are going
into dangerous territory, and we all have to think

00:35:53.428 --> 00:36:01.628
a little bit more. And she especially, I-- I
couldn't--

00:36:01.628 --> 00:36:09.263
LIAM: Well listen, Percy. We are not playing a
game.

00:36:09.263 --> 00:36:11.000
TALIESIN: No.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:25.303
LIAM: And we will all make mistakes, and I wager I
will make my fair share. I've little doubt. And

00:36:25.303 --> 00:36:33.786
Percival, I want to apologize. I'm sorry. But--

00:36:33.786 --> 00:36:38.616
And I punch him in his know-it-all fucking mouth.

00:36:38.616 --> 00:36:44.409
MATT: Do you attempt to move out of the way, or
take it?

00:36:44.409 --> 00:36:47.017
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's take it.

00:36:47.017 --> 00:36:54.754
MATT: All right. (impact sound) Decks you square
in the-- for as hefty as a punch it was? Doesn't

00:36:54.754 --> 00:36:58.716
hurt quite as much as you expected. But it's not
the physical pain that hurts, more than the action

00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:07.341
and the knowledge that there are more
repercussions to your rash decision than even you

00:37:07.341 --> 00:37:10.693
initially anticipated.

00:37:10.693 --> 00:37:25.424
LIAM: Goodnight, Percival.

00:37:25.424 --> 00:37:27.944
TALIESIN: Goodnight, Vax.

00:37:27.944 --> 00:37:29.549
SAM: It's four in the afternoon!

00:37:29.549 --> 00:37:31.218
(laughter)

00:37:31.218 --> 00:37:33.336
TALIESIN: I'm going to work. I'm going into my
studio.

00:37:33.336 --> 00:37:35.288
MATT: All right, who else wants to do something?

00:37:35.288 --> 00:37:37.940
MARISHA: Where'd Kima go?

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:50.142
MATT: Kima is actually-- she's begun day-drinking
into the night! So yeah, she's currently by

00:37:50.142 --> 00:37:55.260
herself in one of the few functional taverns in
Whitestone. It's fairly empty at the moment,

00:37:55.260 --> 00:38:02.047
especially at this hour as the sun slowly sets.
She's not heavy drinking but she's definitely

00:38:02.047 --> 00:38:06.584
nursing a tankard and quietly contemplating as she
sits at the edge of the bar with her hands around

00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:10.870
the tankard. She's staring at her reflection as
she spins it slowly on the wood. You can hear it

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:14.880
(scuffing) on the woodgrain.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.200
MARISHA: Anyone else want to go to the--

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.281
LAURA: I'm going with you, yeah.

00:38:19.281 --> 00:38:22.702
MATT: There's like a few other random patrons, but
no one catches your eye. No one specifically.

00:38:22.702 --> 00:38:25.014
SAM: I'll come, too. Well, actually, wait. Grog,
what're you doing?

00:38:25.014 --> 00:38:26.759
TRAVIS: Nothing yet.

00:38:26.759 --> 00:38:28.785
SAM: I'm with Grog.

00:38:28.785 --> 00:38:33.511
MATT: Okay. So the two of you, into the tavern--
she doesn't notice you guys.

00:38:33.511 --> 00:38:39.624
MARISHA: I go up and put my hand on her shoulder.

00:38:39.624 --> 00:38:42.082
MATT: "Keyleth!"

00:38:42.082 --> 00:38:43.798
MARISHA: Hey! How's it going?

00:38:43.798 --> 00:38:45.396
MATT: "Better."

00:38:45.396 --> 00:38:46.698
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:38:46.698 --> 00:38:49.221
LAURA: I lean up against the bar, next to you
guys.

00:38:49.221 --> 00:38:53.938
MARISHA: Want to check in on Allura?

00:38:53.938 --> 00:38:58.478
MATT: "Let's do it."

00:38:58.478 --> 00:39:01.127
MARISHA: Is there an empty room around here?

00:39:01.127 --> 00:39:05.967
MATT: She looks over to the barkeep. You all stare
over and the barkeep is currently there like

00:39:05.967 --> 00:39:11.135
wiping down the bar section. "For how long?"

00:39:11.135 --> 00:39:13.520
LAURA: For a couple hours.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:16.030
MARISHA: Doesn't need to be that long.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:17.307
MATT: "Two silver?"

00:39:17.307 --> 00:39:20.136
LAURA: We saved your life? And the entire town.

00:39:20.136 --> 00:39:26.505
MATT: "You are fine to use it as you please for
the remainder of the afternoon. Just don't mess it

00:39:26.505 --> 00:39:28.123
"up, please."

00:39:28.123 --> 00:39:36.623
MARISHA: Sure. We'll try really hard to find
better things to do with our time. Okay.

00:39:36.623 --> 00:39:42.457
MATT: All right, you make your way up and the
place is fairly vacant, there are a couple of

00:39:42.457 --> 00:39:50.938
rooms that are currently partially-- the doors are
ajar and you hear voices in there, and you

00:39:50.938 --> 00:39:56.239
recognize it's a couple of the refugees that you
guys brought over from your keep, currently holed

00:39:56.239 --> 00:40:01.305
up in this tavern. An inn floor on the second
floor. But there are a number of open rooms right

00:40:01.305 --> 00:40:03.622
now that you could go ahead and step into for
use.

00:40:03.622 --> 00:40:04.718
MARISHA: Just pick one.

00:40:04.718 --> 00:40:07.749
MATT: Okay. So. Do you want to go ahead and
attempt a Scry ritual?

00:40:07.749 --> 00:40:08.709
MARISHA: Yes!

00:40:08.709 --> 00:40:10.032
MATT: Focusing on...?

00:40:10.032 --> 00:40:11.948
MARISHA: The flower that I gave her before we left.

00:40:11.948 --> 00:40:13.350
LAURA: Ooh, good call.

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:23.591
MATT: All right, so. As you all sit down, Kima
sitting across from you, arms closed. She looks at

00:40:23.591 --> 00:40:29.619
you intensely with this really direct glare,
waiting for some sort of sign of an answer or

00:40:29.619 --> 00:40:36.141
information. As you complete the ritual
preparation of the scrying, your vision transcends

00:40:36.141 --> 00:40:42.201
your form, jettisoned through the ceiling and into
the clouds. Clouds rush past, you can feel the

00:40:42.201 --> 00:40:49.441
wind pushing across your face, your hair, and as
the clouds part you see, below, you see Westruun.

00:40:49.441 --> 00:40:57.747
And from Westruun you can see most of the city, as
you recall, and a large portion of it currently

00:40:57.747 --> 00:41:09.657
looks toppled-over and pushed into ruin. There are
no longer burning black clouds, but white smoke,

00:41:09.657 --> 00:41:16.528
long after a fire or some sort of an impact,
lazily drifting off some of those ruins. It

00:41:16.528 --> 00:41:25.160
focuses even closer, and you see very little
populace in the streets. Most everyone's either

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:35.336
indoors or not visible at the moment. Your vision
clicks in once again, and you can see currently

00:41:35.336 --> 00:41:46.802
some sort of dark room hidden in Westruun. You
see, for a brief instant, a flicker of light, and

00:41:46.802 --> 00:41:55.265
you see Drake Thunderbrand and Allura both
gathering a few small books under their arms,

00:41:55.265 --> 00:42:07.984
silently waiting, quietly. You hear (impact
sounds) some heavy footfalls above. They both just

00:42:07.984 --> 00:42:19.815
stay quiet, stay quiet. Allura stays still for a
moment. She looks over at Drake. They both take

00:42:19.815 --> 00:42:24.533
hands and then (whoosh) convert into that same
energy form you saw that jettisoned out of

00:42:24.533 --> 00:42:29.883
Greyskull Keep, that echoes down a long hallway
that you previously didn't see was attached to

00:42:29.883 --> 00:42:37.701
this room. It leads to a stone spiral staircase
that goes upward before these two dual sparks

00:42:37.701 --> 00:42:44.607
travel through the small crack between where the
edge of a trap door and a wooden floor is as the

00:42:44.607 --> 00:42:54.726
sparks course upward into the now-setting sun. You
can see amongst the sparks the mostly collapsed

00:42:54.726 --> 00:43:01.961
rubble of the Cobalt Reserve, the large library in
the center of Westruun. You can see dozens of

00:43:01.961 --> 00:43:11.927
corpses that have been largely dissolved. You can
see what remnants of their bodies have been eaten

00:43:11.927 --> 00:43:19.463
away by some sort of caustic material, their arms
and fingers tightened up as the muscles pull into

00:43:19.463 --> 00:43:28.594
this horrible, gnarled visage of what once were
the living residents of Westruun. You do see, as

00:43:28.594 --> 00:43:37.097
the spark comes to a stop for a second in its
movement, and you hear briefly overhead (wingbeats)

00:43:37.097 --> 00:43:44.405
and you see rush overhead, wings fully
spread, the black dragon that you had briefly

00:43:44.405 --> 00:43:54.095
encountered in Emon streak upward, roaring loudly,
towards Gatshadow, the tall, dark spire mountain

00:43:54.095 --> 00:44:01.519
just north of Westruun. (whoosh) And as it heads
up there, the sparks (electric sound) continue

00:44:01.519 --> 00:44:05.742
their trek through the streets, and at that point
the ritual fades, its vision unable to maintain

00:44:05.742 --> 00:44:10.858
its focus. Your vision is pulled back up into the
clouds and then thrust back into your current

00:44:10.858 --> 00:44:13.558
position and with a shock you find yourself back in
the tavern.

00:44:13.558 --> 00:44:17.165
LAURA: What did you see? Is she all right?

00:44:17.165 --> 00:44:19.463
MARISHA: She's alive, her and Drake both are
alive.

00:44:19.463 --> 00:44:21.308
MATT: "Good. Where are they going?"

00:44:21.308 --> 00:44:28.115
MARISHA: They're at the Cobalt Reserve, which is
in ruins, as well as the rest of Westruun.

00:44:28.115 --> 00:44:30.896
LAURA: Did you see the dragon?

00:44:30.896 --> 00:44:38.568
MARISHA: Yes, the black dragon is there. Looks
like he's taken up residence in the black spire--

00:44:38.568 --> 00:44:40.686
tower. What was it called?

00:44:40.686 --> 00:44:41.599
LAURA: Gatshadow?

00:44:41.599 --> 00:44:42.682
MARISHA: That one.

00:44:42.682 --> 00:44:46.244
MARISHA: Gatshadow. Allura--

00:44:46.244 --> 00:44:48.470
LAURA: Could you communicate with her when you
scry? I don't know how it works.

00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:50.058
MARISHA: No, I can just look in and see.

00:44:50.058 --> 00:44:51.140
LAURA: All right.

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:58.288
MARISHA: She was grabbing the last few important
tomes, remnants left from the Cobalt Library, I

00:44:58.288 --> 00:45:00.263
mean, Reserve.

00:45:00.263 --> 00:45:01.737
MATT: "They staying in Westruun?"

00:45:01.737 --> 00:45:03.017
MARISHA: It didn't look like it.

00:45:03.017 --> 00:45:04.098
MATT: "Where are they going?"

00:45:04.098 --> 00:45:05.356
MARISHA: I don't know, I didn't see.

00:45:05.356 --> 00:45:06.624
MATT: "Did you talk about where you--"

00:45:06.624 --> 00:45:09.016
LAURA: We left word. And told her we were coming
here.

00:45:09.016 --> 00:45:10.207
MATT: "Here to Whitestone?"

00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:13.228
LAURA: Yes. If you wait, she'll be here.

00:45:13.228 --> 00:45:15.110
MATT: "Who else is coming?"

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:16.319
LAURA: Drake.

00:45:16.319 --> 00:45:19.726
MATT: "Drake. Anybody else on the Council
coming?"

00:45:19.726 --> 00:45:25.048
SAM: We brought some Council members, right? Were
any among our--

00:45:25.048 --> 00:45:27.226
MATT: You're not there, you're with Grog.

00:45:27.226 --> 00:45:28.829
SAM: Oh, that's right, I'm sorry, oh, I'm not
there!

00:45:28.829 --> 00:45:30.264
(laughter)

00:45:30.264 --> 00:45:32.311
SAM: So, Grog! Want to play some bocce ball?

00:45:32.311 --> 00:45:33.767
(laughter)

00:45:33.767 --> 00:45:35.902
MARISHA: I don't know who all's coming.

00:45:35.902 --> 00:45:37.798
LAURA: Uriel.

00:45:37.798 --> 00:45:48.531
MATT: "Dead? Well, that's great. That's fantastic.
What about the rest?"

00:45:48.531 --> 00:45:50.716
MARISHA: His wife and children are here.

00:45:50.716 --> 00:45:51.926
MATT: "Here, okay."

00:45:51.926 --> 00:45:54.353
MARISHA: As well as Gilmore.

00:45:54.353 --> 00:45:56.669
LAURA: Gilmore's Glorious Goods.

00:45:56.669 --> 00:45:58.535
MATT: "Right, right."

00:45:58.535 --> 00:46:01.981
LAURA: Wonderful place to buy all sorts of
products, if it were still... standing.

00:46:01.981 --> 00:46:05.872
MATT: "Huh. I've only heard things, I've not met
this 'Gilmore'."

00:46:05.872 --> 00:46:10.400
MARISHA: You haven't met Gilmore!? Man, I just
assume everyone knows each other.

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:14.693
MATT: "Anybody else? Tofor?"

00:46:14.693 --> 00:46:20.273
LAURA: Yes, maybe...? Yes, Tofor...?

00:46:20.273 --> 00:46:22.227
MARISHA: He might have... been... slain...?

00:46:22.227 --> 00:46:24.123
LAURA: Which one is Tofor?

00:46:24.123 --> 00:46:25.925
MARISHA: She's the dragonborn--

00:46:25.925 --> 00:46:31.813
LAURA: Yes, Tofor-- they did, I think Tofor is--
definitely maybe here.

00:46:31.813 --> 00:46:41.093
MATT: Last you heard, two Council members that
were confirmed still alive by Gilmore when you

00:46:41.093 --> 00:46:57.077
found him-- or, confirmed by Uriel's wife and
family-- thank you, sorry, were Tofor and Asum.

00:46:57.077 --> 00:46:58.518
LAURA: Yes.

00:46:58.518 --> 00:47:03.414
MATT: So both were two of the ones that were saved
by Gilmore, and then once he was too wounded to

00:47:03.414 --> 00:47:07.055
continue, they left to seek for survivors in Emon.
That was the last you heard of them.

00:47:07.055 --> 00:47:13.465
LAURA: Oh. They're not actually here, then. Yes.
They're looking for other survivors, Tofor and Asum.

00:47:13.465 --> 00:47:21.094
MATT: "In the place where this-- and what's this
dragon you keep talking about?"

00:47:21.094 --> 00:47:26.319
LAURA: Oh, shit, you don't know anything. Thordak!
Big. Terrible. Red.

00:47:26.319 --> 00:47:32.463
MATT: As you say the name again, you can see her
eyes resonate with a clarity, and where once was

00:47:32.463 --> 00:47:44.642
this very intense expression and air of demanding
information suddenly recedes into this look of

00:47:44.642 --> 00:47:48.044
sudden fear, and she's briefly lost in thought.

00:47:48.044 --> 00:47:52.195
LAURA: Yes, you defeated him once. He escaped the
Fire Realm.

00:47:52.195 --> 00:48:06.795
MARISHA: Not only did he escape, he tore a giant
tear in the rifts between the Fire Realm and ours.

00:48:06.795 --> 00:48:18.822
MATT: (sighs deeply) "Thordak." And you can see,
she's starting to hyperventilate suddenly, like,

00:48:18.822 --> 00:48:26.617
for all of her strong exterior, this is the first
time, aside from the brief hit of the beholder's

00:48:26.617 --> 00:48:32.663
ray earlier, you see fear in her eyes, and she
starts standing up. (pants) "I need to get some air."

00:48:32.663 --> 00:48:33.880
MARISHA: Kima, Kima, it'll be--

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.089
MATT: "I need to--"

00:48:35.089 --> 00:48:36.796
MARISHA: Sit here, you want to sit down?

00:48:36.796 --> 00:48:38.093
MATT: "I need to get s-- I need to get some air."

00:48:38.093 --> 00:48:39.225
And she storms out of the room.

00:48:39.225 --> 00:48:40.622
MARISHA: Let's go outside.

00:48:40.622 --> 00:48:41.543
LAURA: Actually, Keyleth--

00:48:41.543 --> 00:48:42.325
MARISHA: What?

00:48:42.325 --> 00:48:43.782
LAURA: I shut the door behind Kima.

00:48:43.782 --> 00:48:44.716
MARISHA: Okay.

00:48:44.716 --> 00:48:46.050
LAURA: I want to talk to you.

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:47.126
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:48:47.126 --> 00:48:54.242
LAURA: I would ask my brother, but, knowing him,
he would walk away. What happened?

00:48:54.242 --> 00:48:59.720
MARISHA: Keyleth has a hard time looking her in
the eye.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:08.543
LAURA: Look at me, Keyleth! Be strong! You're
royalty. Tell me what happened.

00:49:08.543 --> 00:49:21.208
MARISHA: Vex, I don't want to ever see you like
that again. I don't want to ever see anybody like

00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:22.700
that again.

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:33.045
LAURA: I grab both sides of her face and force her
to look at me. I'm all right. I'm still here.

00:49:33.045 --> 00:49:46.936
Okay? I need you to tell me what happened. Because
between us? Vax is off. Something's wrong. And I

00:49:46.936 --> 00:49:49.354
need to know what it is.

00:49:49.354 --> 00:49:51.307
MARISHA: We all watched you die.

00:49:51.307 --> 00:49:52.702
LAURA: Yes.

00:49:52.702 --> 00:49:53.851
MARISHA: It's like--

00:49:53.851 --> 00:50:04.039
LAURA: How did I get back? Who brought me back?
Kashaw, Zahra, my brother. Anyone else?

00:50:04.039 --> 00:50:13.241
MARISHA: I guess... you could say, probably an
unseen entity, an unseen force. Oh, I'm

00:50:13.241 --> 00:50:14.531
lightheaded.

00:50:14.531 --> 00:50:15.702
LAURA: Sit down.

00:50:15.702 --> 00:50:16.608
MARISHA: Okay.

00:50:16.608 --> 00:50:18.226
LAURA: There's a bed. Sit down.

00:50:18.226 --> 00:50:24.775
MARISHA: Percy--

00:50:24.775 --> 00:50:26.730
LAURA: Percy helped.

00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:39.326
MARISHA: Let's skip that. When we brought you
back, Kashaw performed a resurrection ritual.

00:50:39.326 --> 00:50:40.977
LAURA: Like we did with Pike.

00:50:40.977 --> 00:50:49.631
MARISHA: Yes. And he called upon a deity and at
first he was afraid that it was Vesh. Which he was

00:50:49.631 --> 00:50:51.802
quite terrified about.

00:50:51.802 --> 00:50:52.838
LAURA: His wife.

00:50:52.838 --> 00:51:02.206
MARISHA: Yes. That, I don't believe, is the
presence that answered his call.

00:51:02.206 --> 00:51:10.042
LAURA: Okay. Fluttery words here, darling. Get to
the point.

00:51:10.042 --> 00:51:20.362
MARISHA: I thought I was going to lose you both. I
thought I was going to lose you and Vax.

00:51:20.362 --> 00:51:27.367
LAURA: Why Vax? Did he get hurt as well? No. What
did he do?

00:51:27.367 --> 00:51:44.585
MARISHA: He-- I don't know. I don't know what he
did. He said to take him instead, is what he told

00:51:44.585 --> 00:51:58.143
the entity. He offered his life for yours. And my
biggest fear was that neither of you were going to

00:51:58.143 --> 00:52:13.757
come back. He offered his life for you. And for
all we know, that offer was accepted.

00:52:13.757 --> 00:52:17.738
LAURA: Right.

00:52:17.738 --> 00:52:25.351
MARISHA: If I had to guess, it was probably the
Raven Queen herself.

00:52:25.351 --> 00:52:29.250
LAURA: Well. It's rather suiting, isn't it?

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:35.427
MARISHA: He seems to do that quite a lot.

00:52:35.427 --> 00:52:46.796
LAURA: Yes. Keyleth? Thank you, dear. And I
leave.

00:52:46.796 --> 00:52:48.002
MATT: Okay.

00:52:48.002 --> 00:52:54.010
MARISHA: I stay behind and burst into tears.

00:52:54.010 --> 00:52:58.965
MATT: Okay. Grog and Scanlan! What're you guys
doing?

00:52:58.965 --> 00:53:01.579
(relieved laughter)

00:53:01.579 --> 00:53:02.957
LIAM: (Grog voice) Go fish.

00:53:02.957 --> 00:53:05.119
TRAVIS: So-- what do you want to do?

00:53:05.119 --> 00:53:15.439
SAM: I don't know. I hadn't really thought about
it. Do you have any games with you?

00:53:15.439 --> 00:53:17.788
TRAVIS: No.

00:53:17.788 --> 00:53:21.772
SAM: Anything in the Bag of Holding?

00:53:21.772 --> 00:53:27.841
TRAVIS: I think there's some orc parts in there
that've been in for a couple months.

00:53:27.841 --> 00:53:29.879
SAM: Doesn't sound very fun.

00:53:29.879 --> 00:53:34.406
TRAVIS: Right. I got all nervous when they
mentioned a goliath's cave, so I need to go

00:53:34.406 --> 00:53:35.740
boom-boom.

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:39.406
SAM: Should I play a song so no one can hear it?

00:53:39.406 --> 00:53:43.222
TRAVIS: Might help. Like, stand guard outside the
door.

00:53:43.222 --> 00:53:46.325
SAM: Yeah, yeah. A little muzak.

00:53:46.325 --> 00:53:47.791
TRAVIS: Would you mind?

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:49.771
SAM: It's what I'm here for.

00:53:49.771 --> 00:53:52.573
TRAVIS: Can I go drop some ordnance?

00:53:52.573 --> 00:54:03.020
MATT: And as you find one of the few local
ramshackle outhouses-- none are quite

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:06.917
goliath-sized, and it's an uncomfortable
experience, but thank God you brought a bard along

00:54:06.917 --> 00:54:11.412
or you would have woken up half the populace just
going to bed, as Scanlan, I--

00:54:11.412 --> 00:54:22.513
SAM: Nothing to see here, everybody! (plays random
chords on the harmonica) Nothing to see here!

00:54:22.513 --> 00:54:24.081
TRAVIS: (coughs, then farts) Oh!

00:54:24.081 --> 00:54:25.429
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:54:25.429 --> 00:54:29.019
(laughter)

00:54:29.019 --> 00:54:32.206
TRAVIS: Now, the music's playing, right?

00:54:32.206 --> 00:54:33.302
MATT: Yeah.

00:54:33.302 --> 00:54:35.456
TRAVIS: It's just a stall, just me?

00:54:35.456 --> 00:54:36.597
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

00:54:36.597 --> 00:54:38.393
TRAVIS: All right, can I take out Craven Edge?

00:54:38.393 --> 00:54:39.597
MATT: Yeah.

00:54:39.597 --> 00:54:41.259
TRAVIS: All right.

00:54:41.259 --> 00:54:44.553
MARISHA: In the outhouse? Sorry, keep going!

00:54:44.553 --> 00:54:50.034
TRAVIS: It's the palace, this is where all the
best thoughts and conversations happen! I don't

00:54:50.034 --> 00:54:51.419
know how it is at your house.

00:54:51.419 --> 00:54:53.150
LIAM: Keep in mind how confined it is, okay?

00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:54.013
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:54:54.013 --> 00:54:54.963
LIAM: And go.

00:54:54.963 --> 00:54:57.465
(laughter)

00:54:57.515 --> 00:55:02.222
MATT: Yes. (grunting)

00:55:02.222 --> 00:55:04.341
SAM: Sounds like a rough one in there, buddy!

00:55:04.341 --> 00:55:08.743
MATT: As you (chuckles) as you see one of the wood
boards splinter out the side for a second--

00:55:08.743 --> 00:55:10.764
SAM: Ah, yup, that's tacos!

00:55:10.764 --> 00:55:20.724
TRAVIS: You might want to play a bit louder and
maybe take a few steps away, it's about to get violent.

00:55:20.724 --> 00:55:22.036
SAM: No problem!

00:55:22.036 --> 00:55:23.436
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:55:23.436 --> 00:55:28.166
MATT: At that moment you focus, and as you can
feel the blade itself grow cold in your fingertips,

00:55:28.166 --> 00:55:35.328
you can see what little bit of light that filters
through the bright orangish-red color that's

00:55:35.328 --> 00:55:39.503
coming from the sunset, you can see a reflection
in the obsidian blade as a voice comes to your ear

00:55:39.503 --> 00:55:43.042
and says, "You fed me well."

00:55:43.042 --> 00:55:52.963
TRAVIS: Yeah, I did, right? I mean, we are really
doing well. Question: so, when we were fighting

00:55:52.963 --> 00:56:01.869
that big Earthbreaker Groot-looking guy, he called
you a 'dark weapon'. Does that-- do you have

00:56:01.869 --> 00:56:04.977
feelings, and did that hurt them?

00:56:04.977 --> 00:56:13.803
MATT: There's a brief pause before you hear this
long, drawn-out, (heavy sigh).

00:56:13.803 --> 00:56:19.456
TRAVIS: Right, hold on! No, no, listen. And I take
my thumb and I run it against the blade real quick.

00:56:19.456 --> 00:56:24.512
MATT: Okay. As you do, all of a sudden the voice
goes, (gasp, contented exhale).

00:56:24.512 --> 00:56:30.300
TRAVIS: Right, yep, sorry, listen. So, my question
is, as much as I love opening up people to feed

00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:36.133
you, I want to know, like-- what's in it for you?

00:56:36.133 --> 00:56:41.196
SAM: Grog, are you talking to your shit?

00:56:41.196 --> 00:56:43.267
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, you got to let it know who's
boss!

00:56:43.267 --> 00:56:44.805
SAM: Okay.

00:56:44.805 --> 00:56:53.703
MATT: The voice creeps in again, this time. "There
is no feeling more terrifying than hunger. And I

00:56:53.703 --> 00:57:03.425
"hunger forever. You help satiate that hunger. That
is our arrangement. I give you the strength of

00:57:03.425 --> 00:57:12.680
"those you cut down, and I feed upon them. If this
is unsatisfactory, I can and have found others who

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:15.419
"are more willing to be part of this
arrangement--"

00:57:15.419 --> 00:57:20.733
TRAVIS: No, no, no, I'm a big fan, really, I mean,
I am yoked out when I'm using you, it's fucking

00:57:20.733 --> 00:57:29.443
amazing. I mean, people are flying apart, it's
like a dream. But listen, can you ever be... full?

00:57:29.443 --> 00:57:35.895
MATT: "I have never been full before. Perhaps
you're the one to find out."

00:57:35.895 --> 00:57:39.896
TRAVIS: I'll bet I am, actually, you're really
lucky you found me and not these other blokes, not

00:57:39.896 --> 00:57:47.627
even half the man I am. But listen, so, there's
no, like, endgame, just to be clear, you just want

00:57:47.627 --> 00:57:52.222
to drink and drink, 'cause I've seen the blood,
right? And usually I wipe it off, but you, like,

00:57:52.222 --> 00:57:56.049
suck it in, and that's a little unsettling, not
going to lie.

00:57:56.049 --> 00:58:09.283
MATT: "My hunger grows, but the air tarnishes my
blade. Perhaps we can continue this conversation

00:58:09.283 --> 00:58:11.202
"elsewhere."

00:58:11.202 --> 00:58:18.089
TRAVIS: (farts) Right, yeah, right. Not even a
problem. Well, look, I like the way you cut

00:58:18.089 --> 00:58:22.915
people open, so we'll continue this another time.
And I sheathe him.

00:58:22.915 --> 00:58:31.652
MATT: All right. As you sheathe, the last thing he
says is, "Don't forget: I hunger always."

00:58:31.652 --> 00:58:41.566
TRAVIS: I kick the door open, and I'm like, if
you're within 200 feet, back up!

00:58:41.566 --> 00:58:45.355
SAM: No one's out here, Grog.

00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:46.403
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:58:46.403 --> 00:58:48.206
SAM: Just me. Are you all right?

00:58:48.206 --> 00:58:49.084
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:58:49.084 --> 00:58:50.958
SAM: I heard you say something about blood.

00:58:51.008 --> 00:58:54.003
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, am I sweating? It was a real
workout, that one.

00:58:54.003 --> 00:58:59.649
SAM: At some point you said, "Are you full?" Are
you talking about-- did you fill it all the way up?

00:58:59.649 --> 00:59:02.235
TRAVIS: Yeah, the privy, you know, it was starting
to give my bum a tickle.

00:59:02.235 --> 00:59:04.018
SAM: Wow!

00:59:04.018 --> 00:59:04.821
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:59:04.821 --> 00:59:05.835
SAM: You topped it off!

00:59:05.835 --> 00:59:07.830
TRAVIS: Yeah. Because, you know, you don't want
to, like, dip in the muck, it's, you know--

00:59:07.830 --> 00:59:08.853
LAURA: Foul.

00:59:08.853 --> 00:59:09.867
SAM: Not at all.

00:59:09.867 --> 00:59:11.078
TRAVIS: Did you want to--

00:59:11.078 --> 00:59:11.994
SAM: I think I'm good.

00:59:11.994 --> 00:59:14.913
TRAVIS: Are you sure? I warmed it up for you,
it's, like, ready to go.

00:59:14.913 --> 00:59:17.776
SAM: I love a good deuce, but not today, I think.

00:59:17.776 --> 00:59:24.700
TRAVIS: All right. Fair enough. But I'm feeling so,
like, vacated--

00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:26.147
SAM: We should go get a bite.

00:59:26.147 --> 00:59:27.558
TRAVIS: I think you're right!

00:59:27.558 --> 00:59:28.941
SAM: (laughs) All right, let's go.

00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:30.186
TRAVIS: (laughing) Okay.

00:59:30.186 --> 00:59:35.221
MATT: Okay. You guys are getting a bite. Percival,
if you want to go ahead and make a tinkering check

00:59:35.221 --> 00:59:37.457
with dexterity modifier to create more
ammunition.

00:59:37.457 --> 00:59:39.381
TALIESIN: Tinkering check with dexterity
modifier?

00:59:39.381 --> 00:59:40.250
MATT: Yes.

00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:41.464
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:59:41.464 --> 00:59:43.294
MATT: Should be plus 11.

00:59:43.294 --> 00:59:45.589
TALIESIN: 16.

00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:52.159
MATT: 16, okay. We'll say, in the time that you've
had here, with the materials you purchased, and

00:59:52.159 --> 00:59:56.538
Whitestone's pretty open to supplying you--

00:59:56.538 --> 00:59:57.769
TALIESIN: I've got a thing.

00:59:57.769 --> 01:00:03.733
MATT: Yeah, I'd say you're able to create roughly
40 or so simple bullets in the time that you have.

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:11.319
TALIESIN: Do I have time to poke at a modification
to the explosive arrow? I want to try and build a

01:00:11.319 --> 01:00:17.192
rock breaker. I'm curious to try and build an
arrow for taking down walls or taking down doors.

01:00:17.192 --> 01:00:18.587
MATT: Like a siege arrow?

01:00:18.587 --> 01:00:26.112
TALIESIN: A light form of siege arrow. Basically,
I want to have a tip that actually manages to

01:00:26.112 --> 01:00:30.247
breach stone and then an explosion that goes
outwards, so it's a shattering arrow.

01:00:30.247 --> 01:00:35.158
MATT: All right, this'll take the remainder of
your evening. You're not going to be able to do

01:00:35.158 --> 01:00:36.337
much else after this.

01:00:36.337 --> 01:00:37.452
TALIESIN: I have nothing else to do.

01:00:37.452 --> 01:00:39.875
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a tinkering
check with your intelligence modifier.

01:00:39.875 --> 01:00:50.796
TALIESIN: Okay. So... That's 23.

01:00:50.796 --> 01:00:57.241
MATT: 23, okay. At the cost of roughly 150 gold
pieces, as you have to go through a few different

01:00:57.241 --> 01:01:04.057
attempts to finally get the design right, and the
metalworking you have here is not perfected.

01:01:04.057 --> 01:01:07.244
You're not at your workshop back at the keep,
unfortunately, so you have to work with whatever

01:01:07.244 --> 01:01:09.137
you have here, and nothing here is designed for
the--

01:01:09.137 --> 01:01:11.157
TALIESIN: No, I've got an okay workshop here.

01:01:11.157 --> 01:01:13.931
MATT: Yeah. The one that you used before,
previously, but that's from mostly discarded

01:01:13.931 --> 01:01:20.046
and-- in the time that you've been gone, it's been
cannibalized for a lot of different uses. But it's

01:01:20.046 --> 01:01:25.000
makeshift. You manage to complete what you think
could function. You're not entirely certain as to

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.127
what the final effect will be, but it all seems to
be in place.

01:01:28.127 --> 01:01:30.331
TALIESIN: All right.

01:01:30.331 --> 01:01:34.404
MATT: So you can write down 'Explosive Siege
Arrow'.

01:01:34.404 --> 01:01:35.842
TALIESIN: Siege arrow.

01:01:35.842 --> 01:01:41.258
MATT: And we shall find out in time what it does.

01:01:41.258 --> 01:01:44.726
MARISHA: Siege arrow. That's fun.

01:01:44.726 --> 01:01:48.374
TALIESIN: A few things I've been working on, and
that's one of them.

01:01:48.374 --> 01:01:51.614
MATT: So. Are you guys resting for the evening?
Anything else you wish to accomplish?

01:01:51.614 --> 01:01:56.545
LAURA: That would probably be smart. I'm pretty tired
after dying, so I'm going to go to sleep.

01:01:56.545 --> 01:01:58.348
MATT: Okay. Vax, anything you want to accomplish
before you--

01:01:58.348 --> 01:02:00.417
TALIESIN: God, the guilt. Okay. Yeah.

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:04.021
SAM: Can I buy a torch somewhere? Just a torch?

01:02:04.021 --> 01:02:06.920
MATT: Sure! Yeah, torches are relatively easy to
find. You want to try one?

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.257
SAM: Three.

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:09.818
MATT: Three torches. That's three copper.

01:02:09.818 --> 01:02:11.827
LAURA: I bring Trinket into the castle with me,
just so you know.

01:02:11.827 --> 01:02:18.598
MATT: After all this has happened, Trinket has
been, like, almost locked to you. Even you going

01:02:18.598 --> 01:02:22.691
upstairs into the tavern, Trinket was like,
(plaintive bear noises) stayed out front, 'cause

01:02:22.691 --> 01:02:25.052
Trinket's learned at this point, you can't really
go into all the taverns.

01:02:25.052 --> 01:02:26.446
LAURA: It's hard, it's hard.

01:02:26.446 --> 01:02:27.952
MATT: It's rough, being a bear.

01:02:27.952 --> 01:02:34.212
SAM: And wherever we're eating, does it happen to
be near Jameson the painter's workshop?

01:02:34.212 --> 01:02:40.483
MATT: No, but it's about a 20-minute walk, if you
wanted to go find him.

01:02:40.483 --> 01:02:46.133
SAM: Be nice to check in with him. Grog, do you
mind walking with me?

01:02:46.133 --> 01:02:47.582
TRAVIS: Absolutely not.

01:02:47.582 --> 01:02:50.058
SAM: All right, so we'll truck on over to
Jameson's.

01:02:50.058 --> 01:02:56.437
MATT: Okay. You head up to it, and this gentleman
is a painter as well as a stablehand, so you find

01:02:56.437 --> 01:03:03.145
your way to the facility, knock on it, and
immediately as the door opens, the smell of fresh

01:03:03.145 --> 01:03:07.885
manure hits your nose and Jameson steps out. "Can
I-- you!"

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:08.935
SAM: Yes! Hi!

01:03:08.935 --> 01:03:10.090
MATT: "Hi!"

01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:11.179
SAM: I've come back.

01:03:11.179 --> 01:03:15.154
MATT: "I meant to deliver, but they told me not
to, because apparently it's not there anymore?"

01:03:15.154 --> 01:03:17.008
SAM: The town, you mean.

01:03:17.008 --> 01:03:18.847
MATT: "Town, yeah, where I was supposed to deliver
it to you."

01:03:18.847 --> 01:03:24.168
SAM: It was wise of you to keep this precious
artifact here, because it would've surely been

01:03:24.168 --> 01:03:25.833
destroyed en route or when it arrived--

01:03:25.833 --> 01:03:29.710
MATT: "It's just the canvas, I don't have a-- It's
a bit too large for my specifications of framing, but--"

01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:31.373
SAM: I'm sure it's huge. Did you finish it?

01:03:31.373 --> 01:03:32.613
MATT: "Yes, yes! Come, come!"

01:03:32.613 --> 01:03:33.686
SAM: Can I look?

01:03:33.686 --> 01:03:34.947
TRAVIS: Oh please, oh please!

01:03:34.947 --> 01:03:36.210
SAM: (laughing) Okay, let's go look!

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:41.120
MATT: He takes one of the hooded lanterns and
turns up the oil wick on it, and as he turns away

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:45.437
he brings you into the back stable area where it's
been sectioned off, and you can see there's paints

01:03:45.437 --> 01:03:49.144
that have been dropped all across the ground and
the hay, it's this multicolored spattering, this

01:03:49.144 --> 01:03:57.483
rainbow vomit across this section of hay floor,
and there in all of its glory, stretched across

01:03:57.483 --> 01:04:04.704
and nailed at the corners to this far, far wall,
you see a fantastical landscape of rolling hills

01:04:04.704 --> 01:04:10.890
and treelines rising up at the edges. You can see
a mountainscape in the distance. The lighting he

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:15.795
uses is magnificent. You can see why many people
in the city specifically requested that you go to

01:04:15.795 --> 01:04:25.034
this gentleman. There atop this fantastic green
hilltop, you see on this fine white and grey steed

01:04:25.034 --> 01:04:33.906
as it raises up, hooves in the air, is yourself,
shirt open, chest slightly fuzzy and muscular. As

01:04:33.906 --> 01:04:36.215
you look off, your hair blowing in the breeze--

01:04:36.215 --> 01:04:37.658
SAM: How's the face? How's the face?

01:04:37.658 --> 01:04:39.580
MATT: The face is pretty damn spot-on.

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:40.696
SAM: Yes!

01:04:40.696 --> 01:04:42.481
(laughter)

01:04:42.481 --> 01:04:46.114
MATT: The best likeness you can find for somebody
who only had a brief reference, as he sketched you

01:04:46.114 --> 01:04:51.065
quickly before he left, and there behind,
clutching you, from the side you can see Pike

01:04:51.065 --> 01:04:59.516
wearing these long greyish-silver and blue robes
that are also flowing behind, a long train--

01:04:59.516 --> 01:05:05.380
longer than it needs to be, stylistically it was a
choice in the artistics point of this-- it is

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:09.640
everything you hoped it would be. You paid good
money for this piece.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:14.352
SAM: I'm going to request-- Grog, I need a minute
here.

01:05:14.352 --> 01:05:17.114
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. I understand, take--

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:18.295
SAM: Just to weep.

01:05:18.295 --> 01:05:19.594
TRAVIS: Take all the time you need.

01:05:19.594 --> 01:05:25.723
SAM: So I regard it for a few minutes, taking in
the beauty and the wonder of all I've

01:05:25.723 --> 01:05:27.158
accomplished--

01:05:27.158 --> 01:05:32.759
MARISHA: I have a question. Would Keyleth and
Scanlan be crying in rooms at the same time?

01:05:32.759 --> 01:05:35.815
MATT: Right now? Yes. For different reasons
entirely.

01:05:35.815 --> 01:05:39.264
SAM and TALIESIN: (singing) Somewhere out
there...

01:05:39.264 --> 01:05:41.187
TRAVIS: Look at the air, look at the air
high-five. There it is.

01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:43.670
SAM, TALIESIN and MARISHA: (singing) Beneath the
pale moonlight

01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:46.555
TRAVIS: So white. That was the whitest of white
high fives ever.

01:05:46.555 --> 01:05:55.267
TALIESIN: I'm imagining this as a canvas of Lisa
Frank majesty, by the way. Like, the greatest Lisa

01:05:55.267 --> 01:05:57.730
Frank Trapper Keeper cover in all the land.

01:05:57.730 --> 01:05:59.014
MATT: Oh, man.

01:05:59.014 --> 01:06:00.803
(laughter)

01:06:00.803 --> 01:06:06.086
SAM: After I weep for a few minutes, I thank
Jameson again and how much did I pay him for this

01:06:06.086 --> 01:06:16.541
thing? You've gone above and beyond, Jameson, and
I know that you're a humble man and you don't want

01:06:16.541 --> 01:06:22.818
me to spread word of your accomplishments, but
please allow me to write you an epic poem or a

01:06:22.818 --> 01:06:27.526
song and tell of your artistic gifts and talents,
please.

01:06:27.526 --> 01:06:31.179
MATT: "That would be a fine tip, sir. Please, yes,
do so."

01:06:31.179 --> 01:06:32.459
SAM: I'll get right on it.

01:06:32.459 --> 01:06:36.085
MATT: "Send them back to Whitestone, please, ask
for Jameson. The more I work this, hopefully I can

01:06:36.085 --> 01:06:38.448
"make my way out of this dunghole."

01:06:38.448 --> 01:06:41.678
SAM: Don't worry, you'll have lots of commissions
after this, I promise you.

01:06:41.678 --> 01:06:42.640
MATT: "Great."

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.903
SAM: And I'm going to give him an extra 50 gold.

01:06:44.903 --> 01:06:47.273
MATT: "I, um--"

01:06:47.273 --> 01:06:49.285
LIAM: That's more than the price of a book.

01:06:49.285 --> 01:06:53.961
MATT: "Sir, I-- thank you. Thank you, thank you."

01:06:53.961 --> 01:06:58.876
SAM: For art supplies to get your shop up and
running.

01:06:58.876 --> 01:07:02.152
MATT: "Of course." He looks down and he's gotten a
little bit of paint on the coins, he's like,

01:07:02.152 --> 01:07:06.021
(muttering and stammering). He puts it aside
somewhere. "Thank you--" Wipes his hands off on a

01:07:06.021 --> 01:07:08.606
nearby rag. "Thank you." And takes your hand and
shakes it vigorously.

01:07:08.606 --> 01:07:10.855
SAM: So, can it be--

01:07:10.855 --> 01:07:14.403
MATT: Yeah, he goes in and he takes his little
claw hammer down, starts pulling the nails out

01:07:14.403 --> 01:07:18.952
from the sides and gingerly rolls up the canvas.
It takes a good, like, three minutes to roll the

01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:24.507
thing up, and it's quite heavy as he hands it over
to you-- (heavy grunt) In your hand, yeah, it

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:25.814
almost takes you off your feet.

01:07:25.814 --> 01:07:26.838
SAM: Grog! Grog!

01:07:26.838 --> 01:07:27.660
TRAVIS: What?

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:28.673
SAM: Can you hold this for me?

01:07:28.673 --> 01:07:30.216
TRAVIS: No, it's you, I mean, you're so
magnificent in it--

01:07:30.216 --> 01:07:31.442
SAM: No, I can't do it.

01:07:31.442 --> 01:07:32.826
TRAVIS: I don't know it-- I really--

01:07:32.826 --> 01:07:35.132
SAM: Grog! I watched you shit for an hour!

01:07:35.132 --> 01:07:37.911
TRAVIS: Hey, all right, I'll pick it up.

01:07:37.911 --> 01:07:43.634
MATT: All right. You guys find your way out. At
this point night has taken; you can hear the

01:07:43.634 --> 01:07:50.820
crickets starting to spread throughout the city.
As the rest of the blue night sky takes on--

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:56.366
Evening is ready, do you guys have anything else
to accomplish before the evening comes to a close?

01:07:56.366 --> 01:08:06.788
LIAM: Wait 'til it's quiet. And I leave the room
that I've been given at Whitestone. And I find my

01:08:06.788 --> 01:08:17.001
sister's door. And I stand outside it, and I stare
at it for a minute--

01:08:17.001 --> 01:08:19.620
LAURA: Vax? Is that you?

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:22.553
LIAM: And I stealth away.

01:08:22.553 --> 01:08:25.004
LAURA: I open the door.

01:08:25.004 --> 01:08:32.327
MATT: Roll a stealth check, roll a perception
check.

01:08:32.327 --> 01:08:35.415
LAURA: Shit.

01:08:35.415 --> 01:08:38.942
LIAM: 25.

01:08:38.942 --> 01:08:40.787
LAURA: 22. Damn it.

01:08:40.787 --> 01:08:43.410
MATT: Nothing to be seen. Must have been your
imagination, Vex.

01:08:43.410 --> 01:08:45.280
TRAVIS: He's good.

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:56.932
LIAM: And I wait for the door to close. And then I
walk to Keyleth's door. And I knock.

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:59.912
MATT: You hear a knock at your door.

01:08:59.912 --> 01:09:01.516
LAURA: And horses.

01:09:01.516 --> 01:09:04.122
MATT: The clomping of horse hooves in the
distance, apparently.

01:09:04.122 --> 01:09:16.247
MARISHA: I open it. Hey. Hi. You okay?

01:09:16.247 --> 01:09:22.268
LIAM: I don't know.

01:09:22.268 --> 01:09:25.742
MARISHA: Come in. Sit down.

01:09:25.742 --> 01:09:27.810
LIAM: I go in.

01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:29.432
MATT: Okay.

01:09:29.432 --> 01:09:33.541
MARISHA: How do you feel?

01:09:33.541 --> 01:10:09.721
LIAM: I don't know. All I know is... that I felt
her. I don't know magic, I don't know anything. I

01:10:09.721 --> 01:10:14.397
open doors, and only when the wind is blowing in
the right direction, sometimes, I think. I don't

01:10:14.397 --> 01:10:18.935
know what happened, but I felt her.

01:10:18.935 --> 01:10:23.888
MARISHA: Do you still feel her?

01:10:23.888 --> 01:10:34.253
MATT: Make a perception check, Vax.

01:10:34.253 --> 01:10:36.255
LIAM: 22.

01:10:36.255 --> 01:10:41.183
MATT: As you're sitting there, looking down at the
ground, as she asks this question, you notice the

01:10:41.183 --> 01:10:46.294
symbol of Sarenrae that you have stitched into the
back of your glove, what was once a very vibrant,

01:10:46.294 --> 01:10:53.964
goldish-brass color has actually very heavily
tarnished, and the metal itself seems to have

01:10:53.964 --> 01:10:58.011
cracked in three places. It was not this way a
day before.

01:10:58.011 --> 01:11:16.765
LIAM: Yeah. I don't know if I did anything in
there, and I wouldn't take it back if I did, but I

01:11:16.765 --> 01:11:20.734
don't know what I'm doing.

01:11:20.734 --> 01:11:26.503
MARISHA: I don't know if it was very noble or very
stupid, to be honest. Probably a little bit of

01:11:26.503 --> 01:11:40.487
both. I can attempt a Greater Restoration spell,
and see if I can sense anything.

01:11:40.487 --> 01:11:49.092
LIAM: I don't know anything about any of that.
I'll let you.

01:11:49.092 --> 01:11:53.898
MARISHA: Can I?

01:11:53.898 --> 01:12:01.161
MATT: Yeah. So as you prepare your mindset for the
cleansing ritual that is the Greater

01:12:01.161 --> 01:12:02.302
Restoration--

01:12:02.302 --> 01:12:04.145
MARISHA: Just lay back.

01:12:04.145 --> 01:12:11.811
MATT: As soon as the dull green energy begins to
course across your fingertips, and as you touch

01:12:11.811 --> 01:12:17.601
the edge of his shoulder to impart his body with
the cleansing energy, it courses through his

01:12:17.601 --> 01:12:27.852
shoulders, the spell completes. You sense no
difference in your current physicality, mindset,

01:12:27.852 --> 01:12:33.541
and there's this pause, this silence, of no
realization, that is suddenly shattered by the

01:12:33.541 --> 01:12:38.338
sound of a (caws). You look over and at the stone
edge of the window you guys are staying in, you

01:12:38.338 --> 01:12:46.115
see stepping there a single dark raven, (clicks,
rapid flapping) and it takes off and flies into

01:12:46.115 --> 01:12:48.007
the night.

01:12:48.007 --> 01:13:09.556
MARISHA: I think this goes beyond any natural
realm that I have any bearing over. And I hug him.

01:13:09.556 --> 01:13:25.133
I thought I was going to lose you. And I'm
terrified I'm still going to.

01:13:25.133 --> 01:13:38.190
LIAM: Keyleth, I love you.

01:13:38.190 --> 01:14:07.782
MARISHA: And I think I love you. I just don't know if I
can allow myself to. I'm terrified to allow myself

01:14:07.782 --> 01:14:38.052
to. You do realize that, if by some crazy chance,
we all somehow make it through this domination

01:14:38.052 --> 01:14:50.112
alive, with the Chroma Conclave, and I complete my
Aramente, I'll still watch all of you die.

01:14:50.112 --> 01:15:17.250
Everything could go phenomenally well. And by
becoming Headmaster, we enter a bit of a realm of

01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:38.053
immortality where I could live for a very, very
long time. I'm afraid every time I look at one of

01:15:38.053 --> 01:16:02.917
your faces that it's going to be the last, and I
feel like deep down I know that day is coming. So

01:16:02.917 --> 01:16:14.060
because of that I'm afraid to let myself feel
anything deeper than I already do.

01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:23.619
LIAM: I quickly leave her room.

01:16:23.619 --> 01:16:29.128
MATT: The door closes behind Vax.

01:16:29.128 --> 01:16:41.931
MARISHA: And for the second time today Keyleth
bursts into tears. Why do people keep leaving me

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:43.853
in rooms alone?

01:16:43.853 --> 01:16:48.012
MATT: All right.

01:16:48.012 --> 01:16:49.961
TALIESIN: Stop it, you're wasting water.

01:16:49.961 --> 01:16:52.817
MARISHA: We're in a drought, god damn it!

01:16:52.817 --> 01:16:54.504
LAURA: When was the last time you showered,
Keyleth?

01:16:54.504 --> 01:16:56.107
MARISHA: It's been a while.

01:16:56.107 --> 01:16:57.435
TALIESIN: Makeup's runny.

01:16:57.435 --> 01:16:58.953
LIAM: Go water elemental.

01:16:58.953 --> 01:17:05.278
MATT: It's the only way. All right, as you all find
yourself coming to rest for the evening, some of

01:17:05.278 --> 01:17:15.481
you easier than others, eventually you get your
full rest. Those who heal up to, say, full hit

01:17:15.481 --> 01:17:19.485
points for a good night's rest here, get your hit
dice back, so not a whole lot were spent.

01:17:19.485 --> 01:17:22.141
TRAVIS: I lose my strength bonuses.

01:17:22.141 --> 01:17:25.942
MATT: Morning comes to you all, and-- yes?

01:17:25.942 --> 01:17:31.797
LIAM: Sorry, just one detail. From there, I went
and fell asleep in this idiot's doorway.

01:17:31.797 --> 01:17:37.035
MATT: Okay. All right. We will go ahead and take a
quick break, we will see you guys back here

01:17:37.035 --> 01:17:43.344
shortly to see what is in store for Vox Machina.
So we'll be back here in a minute.

01:17:43.344 --> 01:31:52.301
[break]

01:31:52.301 --> 01:31:53.694
LIAM: Matt, shit on my face.

01:31:53.694 --> 01:31:55.217
MATT: Welcome back, everybody!

01:31:55.217 --> 01:31:56.798
SAM: It's too close!

01:31:56.798 --> 01:31:58.212
LAURA: They caught it, that one caught it.

01:31:58.212 --> 01:31:59.519
MATT: That was pretty close.

01:31:59.519 --> 01:32:00.687
LIAM: All they heard was "ace."

01:32:00.687 --> 01:32:03.479
MATT: It's all good. Welcome back, guys. We're
going to go ahead and jump back in. So as you all,

01:32:03.479 --> 01:32:09.883
after that, for some, emotional evening, whether
that be conversational emotion or, you know,

01:32:09.883 --> 01:32:16.024
having to go drop an emotional deuce. You know,
that's important. You find yourselves waking up to

01:32:16.024 --> 01:32:21.658
a fresh morning in Whitestone, hints of blue sky
breaking through the cloud coverage, and that's

01:32:21.658 --> 01:32:24.834
rare for this area because it's the northern
portion of the continent, you know that,

01:32:24.834 --> 01:32:31.328
especially being so close to the ocean, a lot of
the cloud, heavy precipitation makes its way in

01:32:31.328 --> 01:32:37.338
the direction of your town, so it's nice to have a
little break in that. Nonetheless, as you guys

01:32:37.338 --> 01:32:40.308
come to consciousness and gather yourselves, your
things, and your plans for the day, what do you

01:32:40.308 --> 01:32:41.315
wish to do?

01:32:41.315 --> 01:32:43.300
TALIESIN: We are a city of seasonal affectation
disorder, so.

01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:47.739
LAURA: Well, I open my door and find my brother
falling through it.

01:32:47.739 --> 01:32:51.524
LIAM: I'm awake.

01:32:51.524 --> 01:32:53.069
LAURA: Oh, good morning.

01:32:53.069 --> 01:32:54.325
LIAM: Hi.

01:32:54.325 --> 01:32:56.041
LAURA: Comfortable bed, I see.

01:32:56.041 --> 01:32:59.665
LIAM: Yeah. Sorry, I couldn't find my room.

01:32:59.665 --> 01:33:04.000
LAURA: Yeah, it's confusing, all these, all these
doors.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.299
LIAM: What time's it?

01:33:05.299 --> 01:33:12.925
LAURA: I have no idea. My nature check tells me
it's roughly, I dunno, eight? Nine? Something like

01:33:12.925 --> 01:33:15.161
that. Seven? Maybe seven.

01:33:15.161 --> 01:33:19.769
LIAM: Come here, you shithead. Don't fucking do
that again.

01:33:19.769 --> 01:33:22.117
LAURA: It's not like I did it on--

01:33:22.117 --> 01:33:25.583
LIAM: Don't fucking do that again, all right? Just
don't fucking do it again.

01:33:25.583 --> 01:33:27.330
LAURA: All right.

01:33:27.330 --> 01:33:28.222
LIAM: Fuck.

01:33:28.222 --> 01:33:30.854
LAURA: I can't breathe. You're about to kill me
again.

01:33:30.854 --> 01:33:35.385
LIAM: You'll live, you'll live. Jesus. Whoever
that is.

01:33:35.385 --> 01:33:49.069
LAURA: So-- (laughs) I heard a rumor that you sort
of saved my life in a really creepy sort of way. I

01:33:49.069 --> 01:33:58.738
talk to people. I talk to so many people. I find
out things. Secrets aren't safe when Vex is around.

01:33:58.738 --> 01:34:02.611
LIAM: Is there any coffee in this fucking castle?

01:34:02.611 --> 01:34:06.497
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait, I have a present for you,
because I feel like you're going to really like

01:34:06.497 --> 01:34:10.974
it. Would you like it?

01:34:10.974 --> 01:34:14.926
LIAM: That's random. All right.

01:34:14.926 --> 01:34:34.179
LAURA: I have this armor that I think would be
really great on you. Do you want it? It's really

01:34:34.179 --> 01:34:37.548
expensive. If you don't take it quickly, I might
change my mi--

01:34:37.548 --> 01:34:39.527
LIAM: I don't want it.

01:34:39.527 --> 01:34:43.983
LAURA: Oh, that was expensive cardstock.

01:34:43.983 --> 01:34:46.497
(laughter)

01:34:46.497 --> 01:34:51.505
LIAM: I'll give you the leather armor after I have
a chance to change.

01:34:51.505 --> 01:34:58.615
LAURA: All right. I love you.

01:34:58.615 --> 01:35:03.190
LIAM: (softly) I know. I know.

01:35:03.190 --> 01:35:04.756
LAURA: Let's get breakfast.

01:35:04.756 --> 01:35:06.167
LIAM: Yeah.

01:35:06.167 --> 01:35:10.087
MATT: From that point, the smell of coffee begins
to fill the air from the inside of the Whitestone

01:35:10.087 --> 01:35:16.642
castle halls. The servants have prepared
breakfast, and a meal is ready for you. Grog

01:35:16.642 --> 01:35:22.814
jumping to attention as the scent reaches your
nose. The rest of you all slowly find your way

01:35:22.814 --> 01:35:24.247
back down. You eat--

01:35:24.247 --> 01:35:28.339
MARISHA: Do we come out and see Vax in the
armor?

01:35:28.339 --> 01:35:31.106
MATT: Are you putting on the armor?

01:35:31.106 --> 01:35:33.017
LIAM: I'm just looking at it in the hallway.

01:35:33.017 --> 01:35:37.829
MARISHA: So I guess I step out and see him looking
at it in the hallway.

01:35:37.829 --> 01:35:40.617
LIAM: Still pretty tired, to be honest. Didn't
sleep a lot in the doorway.

01:35:40.617 --> 01:35:44.776
MATT: Yeah. Some of you guys step out, and you see
Vax standing in the hallway, clutching in his

01:35:44.776 --> 01:35:50.480
hands, looking over all the various, like,
pushed-in, engraved runes across the leatherwork,

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:55.826
the raven feathers that adorn the bottom of the
mantle.

01:35:55.826 --> 01:36:02.340
LAURA: Careful, it smells a lot like must and mold
and birds.

01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:14.499
MARISHA: I walk by and... briefly lock eyes and
keep going without saying anything.

01:36:14.499 --> 01:36:15.787
MATT: Okay.

01:36:15.787 --> 01:36:18.541
TRAVIS: Oh shit, you got the armor now?

01:36:18.541 --> 01:36:22.724
LAURA: He stole it, what can I say? He is a really
sneaky, stealthy kind of guy.

01:36:22.724 --> 01:36:24.253
TRAVIS: Nice.

01:36:24.253 --> 01:36:26.114
LAURA: Yeah. Fair and square.

01:36:26.114 --> 01:36:30.446
LIAM: I just took it for fashion purposes, I suppose.

01:36:30.446 --> 01:36:32.504
TRAVIS: Oh, you need all the help you can get.

01:36:32.504 --> 01:36:33.632
LIAM: Yeah.

01:36:33.632 --> 01:36:38.369
SAM: Should we go out in the woods and unleash an
undead beast that will kill us all?

01:36:38.369 --> 01:36:42.641
TRAVIS: Yes! Christmas morning! Who has that, by
the way?

01:36:42.641 --> 01:36:43.562
SAM: I do.

01:36:43.562 --> 01:36:44.665
TRAVIS: Oh! Yeah!

01:36:44.665 --> 01:36:45.896
SAM: Don't worry, it's safe.

01:36:45.896 --> 01:36:47.308
TRAVIS: Where d'you keep it?

01:36:47.308 --> 01:36:52.941
SAM: Oh! Hold on-- Got a pouch or some-- you know
what? It's back in my room.

01:36:52.941 --> 01:36:58.524
MATT: All right. You go retrieve it.

01:36:58.524 --> 01:37:00.899
SAM: Got it!

01:37:00.899 --> 01:37:01.977
TRAVIS: Where's Percy?

01:37:01.977 --> 01:37:07.000
LAURA: Where's Pike? We should bring her with us.
Can we bring Pike with us? I know she's taking

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.596
care of Gilmore, but.

01:37:08.596 --> 01:37:13.038
SAM: Mm, that's possibly more important. I think
this thing'll be fine!

01:37:13.038 --> 01:37:17.751
LAURA: We need some sort of somebody that can
heal, I think we've learned this for ourselves.

01:37:17.751 --> 01:37:18.932
SAM: I can heal!

01:37:18.932 --> 01:37:22.981
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got potions, we're fine. It's
probably, like, a big Saint Bernard. What's the

01:37:22.981 --> 01:37:23.889
big deal?

01:37:23.889 --> 01:37:28.978
LAURA: (sighs) Okay. We learn nothing, carry on.

01:37:28.978 --> 01:37:30.298
TRAVIS: Where's Percy?

01:37:30.298 --> 01:37:31.652
TALIESIN: I'm right here.

01:37:31.652 --> 01:37:34.019
TRAVIS: Oh! Shit, you were quiet. Hello.

01:37:34.019 --> 01:37:35.695
TALIESIN: (coughs) Hello. Good morning.

01:37:35.695 --> 01:37:37.603
TRAVIS: Need any coffee? An enema?

01:37:37.603 --> 01:37:39.179
TALIESIN: What?

01:37:39.179 --> 01:37:40.512
MARISHA: A coffee enema?

01:37:40.512 --> 01:37:43.446
TALIESIN: What!? No. I'm fine. Good morning.

01:37:43.446 --> 01:37:45.323
LIAM: I'm going to walk off with this shit.

01:37:45.323 --> 01:37:46.416
MATT: Okay.

01:37:46.416 --> 01:37:53.326
TRAVIS: And we go outside with the necklace.

01:37:53.326 --> 01:37:54.754
SAM: Yeah, where're we headed?

01:37:54.754 --> 01:37:55.761
TRAVIS: The woods!

01:37:55.761 --> 01:37:57.589
LAURA: No. The caves. I thought we were going to
the--

01:37:57.589 --> 01:38:00.010
MARISHA: Going to the caves on the edge of the
woods.

01:38:00.010 --> 01:38:01.754
MATT: Yeah. It's the caves that are--

01:38:01.754 --> 01:38:03.131
MARISHA: Going to go through the woods.

01:38:03.131 --> 01:38:06.148
LIAM: (sings) Into the woods!

01:38:06.148 --> 01:38:13.707
MATT: So. You all gather together and make your
way northwest of Whitestone, towards where you

01:38:13.707 --> 01:38:19.242
found the stone giant fortress and the series of
caves that are in the mountain behind it. You get

01:38:19.242 --> 01:38:25.795
there; it's still seemingly abandoned. You case
the area for a while. No noticeable movement other

01:38:25.795 --> 01:38:28.743
than a few woodland entities that exist in that
vicinity.

01:38:28.743 --> 01:38:33.249
LAURA: Primeval Awareness! (radar sounds)

01:38:33.249 --> 01:38:36.830
MATT: Okay. That is now the sound it makes every
time you do it.

01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:37.898
LAURA: I like it.

01:38:37.898 --> 01:38:43.167
MATT: Yeah, so hold onto that one. I'll make that
a new ringtone sound for you guys. What are you

01:38:43.167 --> 01:38:44.299
looking for?

01:38:44.299 --> 01:38:45.999
LAURA: Oh, there's so many things I could sense!

01:38:45.999 --> 01:38:47.235
MATT: Yeah.

01:38:47.235 --> 01:38:49.304
TRAVIS: What about sirens?

01:38:49.304 --> 01:38:50.515
LAURA: Sirens?

01:38:50.515 --> 01:38:54.254
TRAVIS: Wait, what are those things called? The
things that took our horses the last time we were here?

01:38:54.254 --> 01:38:55.241
MATT: Harpies?

01:38:55.241 --> 01:38:56.505
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, whatever.

01:38:56.505 --> 01:38:58.685
LAURA: Sure! Harpies.

01:38:58.685 --> 01:38:59.945
MATT: For how many miles is it?

01:38:59.945 --> 01:39:01.066
LAURA: Six miles!

01:39:01.066 --> 01:39:05.164
MATT: Six miles? Yeah, there's a few blips on the
far, far western side of here. You get the essence

01:39:05.164 --> 01:39:09.896
way off in the mountains, there's maybe a small
nest. Nothing that's immediately dangerous.

01:39:09.896 --> 01:39:13.442
LAURA: What about if I sit for one more minute and
I think if I can sense any giants.

01:39:13.442 --> 01:39:23.298
MATT: You do, to the far, far north. You get the
sense that there is some sort of giant-based

01:39:23.298 --> 01:39:27.347
lifeform maybe two, three miles north of you.

01:39:27.347 --> 01:39:28.497
LAURA: Okay.

01:39:28.497 --> 01:39:29.589
TRAVIS: How's it look?

01:39:29.589 --> 01:39:33.015
LAURA: Well, I mean, clear of the things I checked
for. No giants.

01:39:33.015 --> 01:39:35.296
TRAVIS: Sweet! Let's go! Up to the cave!

01:39:35.296 --> 01:39:37.597
MATT: All right. So the fortress or the caves
behind it?

01:39:37.597 --> 01:39:39.962
TRAVIS: Fortress or cave?

01:39:39.962 --> 01:39:41.998
LAURA: Were they both empty? I don't remember.

01:39:41.998 --> 01:39:44.206
TALIESIN: Everything was empty, if I recall.

01:39:44.206 --> 01:39:47.585
TRAVIS: Yeah. Small space.

01:39:47.585 --> 01:39:48.993
TALIESIN: Let's do the caves.

01:39:48.993 --> 01:39:51.186
LAURA: All right, sure. Cave.

01:39:51.186 --> 01:39:52.394
TRAVIS: Yeah. Cave.

01:39:52.394 --> 01:39:53.516
MATT: All right.

01:39:53.516 --> 01:39:59.896
LAURA: Oh, if we stick to the woods, it's my
favored terrain. If we go into a cave, not as much.

01:39:59.896 --> 01:40:06.663
SAM: The caves would contain it. It can't fly away
or anything.

01:40:06.663 --> 01:40:09.356
TRAVIS: So is it like, cave-fortress, are they
same level? I can't remember.

01:40:09.356 --> 01:40:11.971
MATT: It's a pathway that leads up into a small
ravine in the mountain pass where you guys

01:40:11.971 --> 01:40:16.781
originally walked down into Whitestone. Up against
the north side of where the mountain meets that

01:40:16.781 --> 01:40:20.639
ravine, there's a big stone fortress that is built
into the side of the mountain, and then around

01:40:20.639 --> 01:40:22.303
that are a series of smaller caves.

01:40:22.303 --> 01:40:24.433
LIAM: (singing) Anything can happen in the woods.

01:40:24.433 --> 01:40:27.006
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go to this fortress, then we
got more room to move in case it does suck.

01:40:27.006 --> 01:40:28.505
SAM: All right, fine, fortress.

01:40:28.505 --> 01:40:33.708
MATT: You guys find your way inside, the cold
morning air still has encompassed the stone floor

01:40:33.708 --> 01:40:42.531
itself, you can see there are still the scattered
and slowly decomposing bits of meat and flesh in

01:40:42.531 --> 01:40:46.209
the far corner, you still see the splatters of blood
that have turned black and cracked as it dried. No

01:40:46.209 --> 01:40:53.036
corpses here, as the corpses were retooled by the
Briarwoods while they were in control. The

01:40:53.036 --> 01:40:56.168
fortress other than that is still empty, and
seemingly untouched since you last left it.

01:40:56.168 --> 01:40:59.828
SAM: All right, well, I'm just going to do it then!

01:40:59.828 --> 01:41:03.244
LAURA and MARISHA: Wait wait wait!

01:41:03.244 --> 01:41:06.738
MARISHA: Wait, there's doors open to the cave,
right?

01:41:06.738 --> 01:41:09.331
SAM and TALIESIN: We're in a fortress.

01:41:09.331 --> 01:41:10.885
MARISHA: Fortress. Whatever.

01:41:10.885 --> 01:41:13.566
MATT: (laughs) Coffee's just starting to kick in
for you guys.

01:41:13.566 --> 01:41:22.051
LAURA: Just barely! Do we have any buff spells or
some shit that we should cast, to make us cooler?

01:41:22.051 --> 01:41:23.858
MARISHA: Should I throw a wall up?

01:41:23.858 --> 01:41:25.105
SAM: A wall for what?

01:41:25.105 --> 01:41:26.771
MARISHA: Do I need to bar the entrance? Or are
there doors?

01:41:26.771 --> 01:41:29.318
TALIESIN: Vex, by the way--

01:41:29.318 --> 01:41:31.452
MATT: There are doors, but they're partially ajar
where you left them.

01:41:31.452 --> 01:41:33.525
LAURA: Aww, put it on, it's useful!

01:41:33.525 --> 01:41:35.641
LIAM: No. We're not having this conversation.

01:41:35.641 --> 01:41:37.996
TALIESIN: Vex, by the way, I've got something for
you.

01:41:37.996 --> 01:41:39.112
LAURA: What? Yes, dear?

01:41:39.112 --> 01:41:40.368
TALIESIN: And I pull out the arrow.

01:41:40.368 --> 01:41:42.433
LAURA: What is this?

01:41:42.433 --> 01:41:49.987
TALIESIN: This is an evening of unbridled guilt.
Come here, let me show you. In theory, this is a

01:41:49.987 --> 01:41:51.626
siege arrow.

01:41:51.626 --> 01:41:52.959
LAURA: Okay.

01:41:52.959 --> 01:41:57.666
TALIESIN: Shattering stone, shattering doors,
breaking things that should not be broken.

01:41:57.666 --> 01:41:59.498
LAURA: Breaking hearts left and right?

01:41:59.498 --> 01:42:06.169
TALIESIN: If that is what you're after. It should
work! Never forget you're my favorite,

01:42:06.169 --> 01:42:07.938
and I'm so sorry.

01:42:07.938 --> 01:42:11.570
LAURA: I kiss him on the cheek. Thank you, Percy.

01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:13.683
TALIESIN: That was much nicer than your brother.

01:42:13.683 --> 01:42:16.372
LAURA: Is that a black eye?

01:42:16.372 --> 01:42:18.874
TALIESIN: (stammering) I didn't sleep.

01:42:18.874 --> 01:42:22.167
LAURA: Huh. This is lovely, I can't wait to use
it.

01:42:22.167 --> 01:42:24.021
TALIESIN: There'll be more.

01:42:24.021 --> 01:42:27.004
SAM: All right, in three, two--

01:42:27.004 --> 01:42:28.359
TRAVIS: Wait hold on, hold on hold on!

01:42:28.359 --> 01:42:31.166
TALIESIN: In a circle! Aim it into the center of
the circle.

01:42:31.166 --> 01:42:35.785
LIAM: And is it three-two-one, three-two-one-do
it, or three-two-one and go,

01:42:35.785 --> 01:42:37.140
SAM: On the one. On one.

01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:40.258
TALIESIN: It's Jenga, one one-thousand two
one-thousand three one-thousand four

01:42:40.258 --> 01:42:41.345
one-thousand.

01:42:41.345 --> 01:42:46.417
SAM: Should one of us leave the room in case it
comes out and paralyzes all of us? Just going to

01:42:46.417 --> 01:42:48.413
throw that out there.

01:42:48.413 --> 01:42:50.984
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, we should, what do you call it,
spread out?

01:42:50.984 --> 01:42:53.477
LAURA: Yeah, definitely, let's all surround it and
make sure we're not all clumped up.

01:42:53.477 --> 01:42:55.818
TALIESIN: If only someone had armor that could
make them immune to paralysis.

01:42:55.818 --> 01:43:00.937
LIAM: That's not a bad idea, you get controlled by
things. Maybe you could wait just

01:43:00.937 --> 01:43:02.287
a little bit further back?

01:43:02.287 --> 01:43:05.239
LAURA: This was somebody's pet, all right? It's
probably not smart enough

01:43:05.239 --> 01:43:06.708
to take control of our minds.

01:43:06.708 --> 01:43:07.971
LIAM: That's a big if.

01:43:07.971 --> 01:43:10.421
TRAVIS: I don't mind stepping out, but I would
like to be able to see.

01:43:10.421 --> 01:43:11.574
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah!

01:43:11.574 --> 01:43:16.425
LIAM: Yeah! We won't shut the door, I just want
you outside of any potential blast radius.

01:43:16.425 --> 01:43:22.484
TALIESIN: Let's spread out in a circle; we'll let
it loose in the center, that way it can't even see

01:43:22.484 --> 01:43:23.506
all of us.

01:43:23.506 --> 01:43:28.516
LAURA: All right, I like it. It only gets to see
Scanlan.

01:43:28.516 --> 01:43:30.001
SAM: It can see me.

01:43:30.001 --> 01:43:32.218
LAURA: I'm going to stealth.

01:43:32.218 --> 01:43:36.644
SAM: Well, when a thing is born, it latches on to
the first thing it sees, like its mama.

01:43:36.644 --> 01:43:38.423
LIAM: Yes, we're going to hide.

01:43:38.423 --> 01:43:40.594
MATT: All right, stealth check from both of you
guys?

01:43:40.594 --> 01:43:42.404
MARISHA: So we're going to try and talk to it?

01:43:42.404 --> 01:43:44.061
LAURA: Yeah, Scanlan's going to talk to it.

01:43:44.061 --> 01:43:46.239
MARISHA: Scanlan? You prepared?

01:43:46.239 --> 01:43:47.465
LAURA: Natural 20!

01:43:47.465 --> 01:43:51.427
TALIESIN: You just teleport, there's like a phase
effect.

01:43:51.427 --> 01:43:59.117
MATT: The two of you back off and find the nearby
shaded corners, where some of the haphazardly

01:43:59.117 --> 01:44:04.111
tossed hides and furs are in the corner, you
vanish behind the alcoves keeping a watch.

01:44:04.111 --> 01:44:10.350
LAURA: Trinket, don't stand next to me, it gives
it away. Go stand next to Keyleth!

01:44:10.350 --> 01:44:12.897
TRAVIS: Is there a doorway in the fortress?

01:44:12.897 --> 01:44:15.249
MATT: Yeah, there's the main doorway you guys
entered, which is two--

01:44:15.249 --> 01:44:16.820
TRAVIS: Can I stand in that, then?

01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:20.200
MATT: Sure, you stand there, in the entranceway
that's pushed open, which is wide enough for a

01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:23.703
giant to push through. You got a little bit of room to
each side, but you're there.

01:44:23.703 --> 01:44:27.112
TRAVIS: Vax, is this g-- Vax?

01:44:27.112 --> 01:44:28.741
TALIESIN: It's fine, you're fine.

01:44:28.741 --> 01:44:29.992
SAM: Here we go, guys.

01:44:29.992 --> 01:44:37.705
MARISHA: So, those two are stealthed-- I'm at
Scanlan's left shoulder, back a bit.

01:44:37.705 --> 01:44:39.207
LAURA: And Trinket's next to you!

01:44:39.207 --> 01:44:41.712
MARISHA: And Trinket's next to me. I'm rolling
with Trinket.

01:44:41.712 --> 01:44:46.258
TALIESIN: I've got a little bit of distance, yes,
that's good.

01:44:46.258 --> 01:44:50.109
MATT: All righty, and there's Percy here, and
Travis is off this way. Good to know.

01:44:50.109 --> 01:44:57.649
SAM: I don't know how to use this thing.

01:44:57.649 --> 01:45:00.403
MARISHA: Yeah, we don't know how to use it.

01:45:00.403 --> 01:45:08.601
SAM: By the power of Raven's Slumber, I command
thee: (yells) awaken! Beast! Cruel or otherwise!

01:45:08.601 --> 01:45:14.000
Face your new master, and know his name is
Scanlan!

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.909
(laughter)

01:45:15.909 --> 01:45:19.427
TRAVIS: (laughing) Oh, holy shit! Never could've
been better.

01:45:19.427 --> 01:45:26.199
MATT: As you spend your bonus action to release
the gate hold on the crystal, you guys see as he

01:45:26.199 --> 01:45:31.252
thrusts his hands forward, there's a burst of
shadow energy that, almost like someone throwing a

01:45:31.252 --> 01:45:37.222
big pot of water, this blackness goes out of it,
and then as it hits the ground, it spills into

01:45:37.222 --> 01:45:45.142
smoke on the ground, and as that dark form stops,
it is in the form of an about

01:45:45.142 --> 01:45:55.253
waist-to-lower-torso-height creature. As the form
coalesces into its normal self, you can see before

01:45:55.253 --> 01:46:05.606
you, shaking its head, a rather large, dark grey
and black wolf. (growls, snarls)

01:46:05.606 --> 01:46:08.486
SAM: Easy, easy.

01:46:08.486 --> 01:46:09.949
TRAVIS: Told you it was a dog.

01:46:09.949 --> 01:46:16.356
SAM: Garlic? Galdric, Galdric, easy, Galdric.
Easy. We're friends. Here.

01:46:16.356 --> 01:46:20.126
MATT: He's backing up a little bit, snarling. You
see Trinket starts growling, (growls).

01:46:20.126 --> 01:46:21.787
LAURA: Trinket, be nice-- oh!

01:46:21.787 --> 01:46:25.229
MATT: As you say that (snarls) it looks over at
you in the far corner.

01:46:25.229 --> 01:46:28.430
LAURA: (whispers) I'm natural 20! That still
didn't see me!

01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:35.463
MARISHA: I pet Trinket, like, 'Chill, chill, be
cool'.

01:46:35.463 --> 01:46:44.943
MATT: Trinket backs up a little bit, but still
locking eyes. You can see this wolf now, its gums

01:46:44.943 --> 01:46:51.447
and teeth are bared, its fur is all puffed up, its
tail is-- it's definitely holding its ground and

01:46:51.447 --> 01:46:53.639
trying to make itself look as intimidating as
possible.

01:46:53.639 --> 01:46:55.427
SAM: Is it a small beast?

01:46:55.427 --> 01:47:00.668
MATT: This would be, technically, borderline
medium. This'd be medium, technically.

01:47:00.668 --> 01:47:03.467
SAM: I can only speak with small beasts.

01:47:03.467 --> 01:47:05.965
MARISHA: Wait, use Speak with Animals?

01:47:05.965 --> 01:47:10.001
LIAM: (laughs) She swatted me and said, 'Put your
armor on,' so I'm doing it.

01:47:10.001 --> 01:47:11.829
MATT: Okay. That'll take you about 15 minutes.

01:47:11.829 --> 01:47:12.698
LAURA: Aw.

01:47:12.698 --> 01:47:14.316
LIAM: 15 minutes! Well, guess I'm doing it.

01:47:14.316 --> 01:47:18.426
MATT: All right. You don't just slip on leather
armor. (chuckles)

01:47:18.426 --> 01:47:20.465
LIAM: No, I get that, I get that, I would've
guessed two minutes.

01:47:20.465 --> 01:47:26.360
TRAVIS: Can somebody check to see if it's actually
a wolf or just looks like one? Like, check it?

01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:28.619
LAURA: Can I use my perception?

01:47:28.619 --> 01:47:32.432
MATT: You're a bit far away from it right now. You
can try to get closer if you want.

01:47:32.432 --> 01:47:33.776
LAURA: Can I sneak?

01:47:33.776 --> 01:47:35.507
MATT: Yeah, make another stealth check.

01:47:35.507 --> 01:47:39.281
LAURA: I do get advantage, because of my cloak.
Sweet.

01:47:39.281 --> 01:47:41.444
LIAM: You should yell out, 'I'm stealthing'.

01:47:41.444 --> 01:47:47.359
LAURA: I'm stealthing! Damn it. 19?

01:47:47.359 --> 01:47:52.754
MATT: Okay. As you begin making your way forward,
it doesn't seem to notice you.

01:47:52.754 --> 01:47:53.991
LAURA: Hey, it doesn't?

01:47:53.991 --> 01:47:54.867
MATT: No.

01:47:54.867 --> 01:47:56.771
LAURA: Can I see it better now to perceive it?

01:47:56.771 --> 01:48:01.004
MATT: Looking right at it, and from your
experience in the wild as well, and Keyleth,

01:48:01.004 --> 01:48:09.022
you're getting it, this does not appear to
be anything beyond a large wolf.

01:48:09.156 --> 01:48:16.977
TALIESIN: I'm going to get on my knees and put out
my hand and call it.

01:48:16.977 --> 01:48:19.527
Galdric, Galdric.

01:48:19.527 --> 01:48:22.715
MATT: Go ahead and make an animal handling check.

01:48:22.715 --> 01:48:24.977
SAM: Animal handling! We've never done that
before!

01:48:24.977 --> 01:48:27.384
LAURA: If I help my brother get on the armor, will
it happen faster?

01:48:27.384 --> 01:48:28.238
MATT: Probably.

01:48:28.238 --> 01:48:29.521
LAURA: I help him put on the armor.

01:48:29.521 --> 01:48:30.471
MATT: Okay.

01:48:30.471 --> 01:48:32.717
LIAM: (whispering) Ow ow ow! That's too tight!

01:48:32.717 --> 01:48:34.640
LAURA: Well, you're not the same size as the other
guy!

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:40.096
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a little bit better. Ten.

01:48:40.096 --> 01:48:44.545
MATT: Ten. As you put out your hand, Galdric
snarls, and as you say, "Here, boy."

01:48:44.545 --> 01:48:48.990
(growls and snaps) It lashes out at your hand.

01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:53.256
That is going to be-- That's a 21 to hit?

01:48:53.256 --> 01:48:58.165
TALIESIN: I'll take it.

01:48:58.165 --> 01:49:01.204
TRAVIS: Keyleth, can't you talk to, like, plants
and shit?

01:49:01.204 --> 01:49:05.032
MATT: You take six points of piercing damage as
its jaws clench down on your hand, and you tear

01:49:05.032 --> 01:49:07.863
your hand away. You can feel the warmth flowing
under the glove.

01:49:07.863 --> 01:49:09.581
TALIESIN: Gently, I'm gentle with it.

01:49:09.581 --> 01:49:11.115
MARISHA: I cast Speak with Animals.

01:49:11.115 --> 01:49:14.712
LIAM: I click my Boots of Haste!

01:49:14.712 --> 01:49:16.138
MATT: You do?

01:49:16.138 --> 01:49:17.627
SAM: Aren't you getting dressed?

01:49:17.627 --> 01:49:18.979
LAURA: He can dress faster!

01:49:18.979 --> 01:49:21.072
TRAVIS: Speed change.

01:49:21.072 --> 01:49:22.336
MATT: All right.

01:49:22.336 --> 01:49:23.349
TRAVIS: Quick change.

01:49:23.349 --> 01:49:24.513
SAM: Seven-and-a-half minutes!

01:49:24.513 --> 01:49:26.244
(laughter)

01:49:26.244 --> 01:49:30.457
MATT: You guys all become immediately aware of the
creaking of leather in the distance as the two

01:49:30.457 --> 01:49:32.917
siblings are in the process of fast-changing one
of the other.

01:49:32.917 --> 01:49:34.428
LAURA: The rustle of feathers.

01:49:34.428 --> 01:49:44.776
MARISHA: Okay, I cast Speak with Animals. And I
crouch down to the ground. And bow down a little

01:49:44.776 --> 01:49:49.366
bit, and I say: are you the one they call
Galdric?

01:49:49.366 --> 01:49:56.702
MATT: Looks over at you for a second. The growl
stops, and its posture changes a little bit. It

01:49:56.702 --> 01:49:58.433
raises its nose. (sniffs)

01:49:58.433 --> 01:50:00.811
MARISHA: Was Purvan your master?

01:50:00.811 --> 01:50:06.055
MATT: Looking at you as you guys hear Keyleth
making this series of growling sounds.

01:50:06.055 --> 01:50:08.257
LAURA: Trinket totally understands you, no?

01:50:08.257 --> 01:50:11.744
MATT: Strangely enough, Trinket does, Trinket's
like, (confused bear noise).

01:50:11.744 --> 01:50:15.027
TALIESIN: Trinket is Scooby-Doo, apparently.

01:50:15.027 --> 01:50:19.398
TRAVIS: Shitballs! Taint! You going that way?

01:50:19.398 --> 01:50:20.882
MARISHA: Oh my god, I get a secret!

01:50:20.882 --> 01:50:29.074
SAM: There are several items that are sold out at
the store! If you'd like to go on and see what

01:50:29.074 --> 01:50:32.898
items have already sold out, check it out.
(laughs)

01:50:32.898 --> 01:50:35.422
LAURA: We need to get more t-shirts in stock.

01:50:35.422 --> 01:50:38.760
SAM: Yeah, we know that. We know that, guys. We
know.

01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:46.549
LAURA: That needs to happen. But there is still
the Critical Role logo t-shirt available. What is

01:50:46.549 --> 01:50:48.154
happening? What is he--

01:50:48.154 --> 01:50:49.705
SAM: Is there a ring or something?

01:50:49.705 --> 01:50:50.974
LAURA: Is the ring still available?

01:50:50.974 --> 01:50:51.782
SAM: I don't know.

01:50:51.782 --> 01:50:53.764
LAURA: If the ring is still available, check out
our ring!

01:50:53.764 --> 01:51:07.867
MARISHA: I can respond back, right? Your master
died a great champion for the Raven Queen. He has

01:51:07.867 --> 01:51:17.365
been paid a great honor, and now the Raven Queen
has chosen a new master.

01:51:17.365 --> 01:51:19.518
LAURA: I push Vax forward.

01:51:19.518 --> 01:51:25.243
MATT: You've gotten maybe part of the tunic on.

01:51:25.243 --> 01:51:27.518
(laughter)

01:51:27.518 --> 01:51:30.271
SAM: Is he Donald-Duck-ing it right now?

01:51:30.271 --> 01:51:37.833
MATT: Practically. There are undergarments, but
not much. It's, like, bare legs and knees, part of

01:51:37.833 --> 01:51:44.755
an arm. Yeah, he got thrust out of the changing
room about 20 seconds into it.

01:51:44.755 --> 01:51:46.419
SAM: Nice.

01:51:46.419 --> 01:51:50.039
LIAM: I still walk toward the wolf.

01:51:50.039 --> 01:51:51.527
TALIESIN: Waddle.

01:51:51.527 --> 01:51:54.728
LIAM: No no no, I did the top, I did the top,
c'mon!

01:51:54.728 --> 01:51:57.604
MATT: The wolf turns his head a little bit
curiously.

01:51:57.604 --> 01:51:59.759
MARISHA: I continue to speak to the wolf.

01:51:59.759 --> 01:52:03.842
LIAM: And I kneel. And bow my head.

01:52:03.842 --> 01:52:17.106
MARISHA: A great darkness has fallen upon our
lands. Upon Othanzia. We could use all of the

01:52:17.106 --> 01:52:29.359
assistance that we can achieve. Would you be
willing to find a new purpose? Join Vax'ildan--

01:52:29.359 --> 01:52:33.319
LIAM: Keyleth?

01:52:33.319 --> 01:52:35.088
MARISHA: Yes?

01:52:35.088 --> 01:52:40.233
LIAM: Tell him to come forward and look into my
eyes.

01:52:40.233 --> 01:52:42.205
LAURA: (whispers) That's a bad idea for dogs.

01:52:42.205 --> 01:52:43.645
LIAM: Tell him.

01:52:43.645 --> 01:52:47.416
LAURA: (whispers) It's gonna bite your face off.

01:52:47.416 --> 01:53:00.043
MARISHA: Galdric. Please. Approach your new master
and look into his eyes.

01:53:00.043 --> 01:53:02.181
LAURA: Give him some chocolate, man!

01:53:02.181 --> 01:53:08.630
MATT: The wolf looks towards you, looks towards
the loosely half-dressed half-elf.

01:53:08.630 --> 01:53:13.526
MARISHA: Look into his eyes. I said look into his
eyes. And see the touch of the Raven Queen inside

01:53:13.526 --> 01:53:14.489
of him.

01:53:14.489 --> 01:53:21.797
MATT: Wolf slowly stalks towards you across the
stone floor. You can hear the claws of the wolf

01:53:21.797 --> 01:53:27.998
clattering against the stonework. As you can see
it's partially, like, digging into the stonework

01:53:27.998 --> 01:53:30.534
with each step. It has purpose with each stride.

01:53:30.534 --> 01:53:34.107
LIAM: As it's coming, I'm taking daggers out and
throwing 'em on the ground.

01:53:34.107 --> 01:53:52.326
MATT: The wolf stops and looks up at you. Turns
around and walks towards the doorway where you are.

01:53:52.326 --> 01:53:55.141
SAM: Where who is?

01:53:55.141 --> 01:53:59.545
MATT: Where Grog is. Grog, who's now at the door,
at the exit.

01:53:59.545 --> 01:54:01.264
LAURA: (whispers) What's his name?

01:54:01.264 --> 01:54:02.819
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Galdric.

01:54:02.819 --> 01:54:07.335
MARISHA: Galdric!

01:54:07.335 --> 01:54:10.147
MATT: Keeps walking.

01:54:10.147 --> 01:54:11.944
LAURA: Galdric!

01:54:11.944 --> 01:54:13.664
SAM: Going to stop him, Grog?

01:54:13.664 --> 01:54:14.852
TRAVIS: Well, I'm in the doorway.

01:54:14.852 --> 01:54:21.512
MARISHA: Grog, don't move. Don't move. Look at the
dog. Don't move, and don't hurt the dog. Please

01:54:21.512 --> 01:54:22.821
just look at the dog.

01:54:22.821 --> 01:54:24.898
LAURA: I pull out one of my treats I have for
Trinket.

01:54:24.898 --> 01:54:28.088
MATT: Okay. Trinket starts lumbering up towards
you (thudding).

01:54:28.088 --> 01:54:32.503
LAURA: Wait, wait, Trinket-- This is for your
buddy Galdric. Galdric!

01:54:32.503 --> 01:54:36.302
MATT: Just keeps walking, doesn't even look at you
in the face, walks--

01:54:36.302 --> 01:54:37.980
LAURA: I throw the treat and say, hey!

01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:44.440
MATT: It scatters across the stone. Walks between
your legs and exits out.

01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:47.901
TRAVIS: I pivot on my back foot. I take out Craven
Edge--

01:54:47.901 --> 01:54:49.000
TALIESIN: No!

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.523
TRAVIS: No, I do, I take out Craven Edge and I
sink it into the earth right beside his head. And

01:54:54.523 --> 01:54:57.531
I say, (shouts) heel!

01:54:57.531 --> 01:55:01.369
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

01:55:01.369 --> 01:55:04.722
LAURA: Whoa, is it good, is it good?

01:55:04.722 --> 01:55:07.256
TRAVIS: 20.

01:55:07.256 --> 01:55:16.888
MATT: As the sword (crack) into the rock outside
of this fortress, it probably embeds itself a good

01:55:16.888 --> 01:55:23.528
foot and a half into the mountain. You guys all
hear Grog's shout echo through the inside of the

01:55:23.528 --> 01:55:31.036
fortress itself, causing little bits of dust and
small pebbles to dislodge from the roof, slowly

01:55:31.036 --> 01:55:37.531
fall down. The wolf has stopped and spun in its
place and reached out and lashed the blade with

01:55:37.531 --> 01:55:41.829
its jaws and (cling) as it releases it.

01:55:41.829 --> 01:55:56.746
TRAVIS: Stay.

01:55:56.746 --> 01:55:58.972
MATT: He sits.

01:55:58.972 --> 01:56:02.434
TRAVIS: That went well!

01:56:02.434 --> 01:56:05.987
(laughter)

01:56:05.987 --> 01:56:08.007
SAM: Dog whisperer!

01:56:08.007 --> 01:56:09.490
TRAVIS: Good pup.

01:56:09.490 --> 01:56:12.219
SAM: Are you its master now?

01:56:12.219 --> 01:56:21.587
TRAVIS: No, no, I don't think it has a master.
This is a very powerful beast. But it needs a firm

01:56:21.587 --> 01:56:35.025
hand. And I think it needs a job. So. What do we
plan to do with Galdric? Said his name right?

01:56:35.025 --> 01:56:36.200
SAM: Yeah.

01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:38.906
LAURA: We plan on having him help us kill some
dragons?

01:56:38.906 --> 01:56:43.218
TALIESIN: I think he's a wolf. I think perhaps
something a little less ambitious.

01:56:43.218 --> 01:56:48.351
LAURA: Trinket hides very well when dragons are
around.

01:56:48.351 --> 01:56:57.803
TALIESIN: I think, perhaps, joining the Whitestone
conclave might be a-- Having him

01:56:57.803 --> 01:56:59.630
guard Whitestone, perhaps.

01:56:59.630 --> 01:57:01.742
LAURA: Good, yeah! I like it!

01:57:01.742 --> 01:57:09.594
TRAVIS: I reach into the Bag of Holding and I pull
out one thing of dry food rations, and a probably

01:57:09.594 --> 01:57:13.151
pretty rotten chunk of dark elf brain.

01:57:13.151 --> 01:57:16.683
LIAM: Where did we get that?

01:57:16.683 --> 01:57:20.069
TRAVIS: Oh, there's a veritable Walmart of shit in
this bag.

01:57:20.069 --> 01:57:22.058
(laughter)

01:57:22.058 --> 01:57:25.672
TRAVIS: And I, like a hamburger patty, smash it
all together.

01:57:25.672 --> 01:57:31.664
MATT: The only reason you even know this was at
one point dark elf brain matter is because that's

01:57:31.664 --> 01:57:38.121
what you willed to reach in and find. It does not
at all visually match your memory of its--

01:57:38.121 --> 01:57:41.069
TRAVIS: Does it have a little bit of a viscous-y
ooze, mostly?

01:57:41.069 --> 01:57:42.475
MATT: Oh yeah, no, it's--

01:57:42.475 --> 01:57:44.342
TRAVIS: It'll soften up the dry food.

01:57:44.342 --> 01:57:45.475
LIAM: Gray Chicken McNuggets.

01:57:45.475 --> 01:57:48.211
MATT: It'll soften up a lot of things. It's pretty
terrifying.

01:57:48.211 --> 01:57:49.505
LAURA: It'll make the wolf vomit.

01:57:49.505 --> 01:57:53.999
TRAVIS: So I throw that on the ground, and I pour
a little ale on top of it.

01:57:53.999 --> 01:57:55.983
(laughter)

01:57:55.983 --> 01:57:57.974
SAM: Wolves love getting drunk.

01:57:57.974 --> 01:58:01.688
MATT: Very good. It leans forward and smells it.

01:58:01.688 --> 01:58:05.421
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, it wasn't the best, I can do
better. Okay.

01:58:05.421 --> 01:58:09.358
LAURA: Trinket goes up and starts eating it.

01:58:09.358 --> 01:58:12.598
TRAVIS: He's going to barf that all over the
carpet later.

01:58:12.598 --> 01:58:14.880
LIAM: Forget the chocolate.

01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:16.993
TRAVIS: I need to carry beef in this bitch.

01:58:16.993 --> 01:58:18.848
TALIESIN: It goes bad.

01:58:18.848 --> 01:58:22.182
LIAM: We have Dork! We've got nothing of Dork
left?

01:58:22.182 --> 01:58:28.788
LAURA: Oh, you know what I have, by the way? I
still have, like, a cooler Bag of Holding. That we

01:58:28.788 --> 01:58:30.192
got from the Slayer's Take.

01:58:30.192 --> 01:58:32.120
TRAVIS: Oh! That's really good to know.

01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:34.942
TRAVIS: I pour into a little chalice some ale.

01:58:34.942 --> 01:58:40.636
LAURA: Like, it keeps things cold. Yeah, it's like
a little bitty one, but it keeps parts from going bad.

01:58:40.636 --> 01:58:47.802
MATT: It's nowhere near as large as a Bag of
Holding, but it has a slow stasis for organic goods.

01:58:47.802 --> 01:58:50.268
SAM: We should keep some food on hand next time!

01:58:50.268 --> 01:58:51.788
LAURA: Totally!

01:58:51.788 --> 01:58:56.324
TRAVIS: I offer him some ale, just to see if he
even likes it. Some dogs like beer, some others don't.

01:58:56.324 --> 01:58:58.317
MATT: Mm. Wolf doesn't seem to be interested.

01:58:58.317 --> 01:59:00.150
TRAVIS: Yeah, all right. Then I chug it.

01:59:00.150 --> 01:59:07.198
SAM: So are we telling this wolf something or
commanding it to come with us as we return to town?

01:59:07.198 --> 01:59:11.452
TALIESIN: I think he would be helpful to guard the
town, at this point.

01:59:11.452 --> 01:59:13.396
LAURA: Well, he'll follow Grog, I suppose.

01:59:13.396 --> 01:59:15.698
SAM: Let's go back to town and bring him with us.

01:59:15.698 --> 01:59:17.020
TRAVIS: All right.

01:59:17.020 --> 01:59:20.366
MATT: You guys return to Whitestone. It's another,
like, three-hour trek to find your way back down

01:59:20.366 --> 01:59:27.855
to the city. Stalks up next to you. Definitely
seems to be attentive to your commands. Doesn't

01:59:27.855 --> 01:59:33.175
appear to be a bond per se, but of everyone that
it's encountered so far, you're the only one that

01:59:33.175 --> 01:59:35.458
really gathered its respect.

01:59:35.458 --> 01:59:38.401
LAURA: I threw a treat at it. I don't understand.

01:59:38.401 --> 01:59:41.588
TRAVIS: That's a great thing to throw at a giant
400-pound bull mastiff.

01:59:41.588 --> 01:59:47.358
MARISHA: I spoke words at it. Apparently that's
not good enough. Communicating.

01:59:47.358 --> 01:59:51.860
TRAVIS: Right, so we're walking back to town.
We've got a giant fuck-off wolf with us.

01:59:51.860 --> 01:59:54.845
Vax looks like Edward Scissorhands.

01:59:54.845 --> 01:59:57.414
LIAM: I'm peeling that off as we walk.

01:59:57.414 --> 01:59:58.451
LAURA and TRAVIS: What?

01:59:58.451 --> 01:59:59.334
TRAVIS: No!

01:59:59.334 --> 02:00:00.430
LAURA: Leave it the fuck on!

02:00:00.430 --> 02:00:01.327
LIAM: I'm peeling it off.

02:00:01.327 --> 02:00:03.055
LAURA: It's really expensive. What, do you want to
damage it?

02:00:03.055 --> 02:00:04.869
LIAM: I'm peeling it off.

02:00:04.869 --> 02:00:07.663
LAURA: (quietly) Fuck, he doesn't appreciate
presents.

02:00:07.663 --> 02:00:12.234
MATT: All right, so you take what little bit of
the armor you had on, off, and are you putting

02:00:12.234 --> 02:00:13.740
your other armor back on?

02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:15.562
LAURA: He doesn't have any other armor. I took his
armor.

02:00:15.695 --> 02:00:19.730
LIAM: I have regular fucking armor that I grew up
in with you, you fucking shit.

02:00:19.730 --> 02:00:24.504
SAM: Do you want to trade with me, Vax? I've got
some armor you could take.

02:00:24.504 --> 02:00:26.213
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:00:26.213 --> 02:00:27.735
LIAM: You're a funny man.

02:00:27.735 --> 02:00:33.833
MATT: All right, so you're back in town and you
have a wolf.

02:00:33.833 --> 02:00:36.017
TRAVIS: Do we find a holding pen for the wolf?

02:00:36.017 --> 02:00:38.735
TALIESIN: I don't think we need to. I think we can
communicate to him--

02:00:38.735 --> 02:00:40.608
LAURA: No. Tell him not to attack villagers.

02:00:40.608 --> 02:00:44.419
TALIESIN: Ask him if he'll be willing to keep the
town safe.

02:00:44.419 --> 02:00:48.464
LAURA: Do it in a really aggressive way, though,
Keyleth. Stern.

02:00:48.464 --> 02:00:50.389
MARISHA: Very aggressive? Okay. Okay.

02:00:50.389 --> 02:00:52.592
SAM: We should find some food for the thing, too.

02:00:52.592 --> 02:00:56.258
MARISHA: If I turned into a dog. If I turned into
a wolf, do you think he'd respect me more?

02:00:56.258 --> 02:00:57.516
LAURA: No, he'll probably attack you.

02:00:57.516 --> 02:00:58.692
TRAVIS: He'll mount you.

02:00:58.692 --> 02:01:00.281
LAURA: Or he'll bone you.

02:01:00.281 --> 02:01:01.695
TALIESIN: I'm not ready for that game.

02:01:01.695 --> 02:01:02.962
SAM: Do it.

02:01:02.962 --> 02:01:04.486
TRAVIS: Let's be clear.

02:01:04.486 --> 02:01:07.320
(laughter)

02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:08.852
LAURA: Matt's like, "mm-mm."

02:01:08.852 --> 02:01:10.355
LIAM: Oh, you soured the DM.

02:01:10.355 --> 02:01:11.630
(laughter)

02:01:11.630 --> 02:01:14.208
TALIESIN: To be fair, that's happened before.

02:01:14.208 --> 02:01:15.940
LAURA: Yeah, I remember.

02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:17.170
TALIESIN: With the troll.

02:01:17.170 --> 02:01:20.492
TRAVIS: With the troll. It was so good. That was
you, wasn't it?

02:01:20.492 --> 02:01:22.052
TALIESIN: No, it wasn't me. Was it you?

02:01:22.052 --> 02:01:23.200
SAM: I don't know.

02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:24.604
TRAVIS: Who was getting humped on?

02:01:24.604 --> 02:01:25.820
TALIESIN: I don't remember.

02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:30.819
SAM: Finalize this wolf so we can go kill
something.

02:01:30.819 --> 02:01:39.016
MARISHA: I take my staff and I say, Galdric! I'm
being assertive.

02:01:39.016 --> 02:01:40.128
LIAM: Yes.

02:01:40.128 --> 02:01:41.539
SAM: She's the alpha.

02:01:41.539 --> 02:01:43.607
LAURA: (whispering) Grog, go stand behind her.

02:01:43.607 --> 02:01:47.846
MARISHA: You want a task? I'll give you one.

02:01:47.846 --> 02:01:53.590
MATT: All right. How long does Speak With--

02:01:53.590 --> 02:01:54.978
MARISHA: I don't know.

02:01:54.978 --> 02:01:57.864
MATT: It lasts for ten minutes, so you can cast it
again. It's first level.

02:01:57.864 --> 02:01:59.460
MARISHA: Oh, has it not been ten minutes?

02:01:59.460 --> 02:02:01.600
MATT: It has been more than ten minutes. It took
you three hours to return.

02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:03.524
MARISHA: Okay, we walked back? Okay, I'll cast it
again.

02:02:03.524 --> 02:02:04.745
MATT: All righty.

02:02:04.745 --> 02:02:09.500
MARISHA: Can I cast Speak With Animals on other
people? I can't, right? No.

02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:13.488
MATT: All right, so as you shout, go ahead and
make an animal handling check, with advantage

02:02:13.488 --> 02:02:14.997
because of your ability to speak.

02:02:14.997 --> 02:02:17.324
MARISHA: With advantage?

02:02:17.324 --> 02:02:18.469
MATT: Yes.

02:02:18.469 --> 02:02:28.577
MARISHA: I'll take the-- what is that, 16? Plus a
six, so 22.

02:02:28.577 --> 02:02:38.141
MATT: Okay. Galdric turns to you and essentially
leans towards you and you get the essence, the

02:02:38.141 --> 02:02:41.440
idea of a message across, and to keep me from
having to walk behind now, at this point, as you

02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:47.531
guys have managed to make seeming amends at the
moment, employs the idea of,

02:02:47.531 --> 02:02:50.391
"I'll listen if you give me a task."

02:02:50.391 --> 02:02:54.338
MARISHA: He talked back.

02:02:54.338 --> 02:02:56.085
LAURA: Have him guard the village.

02:02:56.085 --> 02:03:05.920
MARISHA: Okay. (louder) Galdric. Only a beast of
your great fortitude--

02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:07.471
LAURA: Just fucking tell him to do it!

02:03:07.471 --> 02:03:11.141
MARISHA: Right, okay. Sorry. Would you like to
guard--

02:03:11.141 --> 02:03:12.639
SAM: It's a command.

02:03:12.639 --> 02:03:17.305
MARISHA: -- the town, Whitestone? (shouting) Guard
this town, dog.

02:03:17.305 --> 02:03:19.026
TRAVIS: Keyleth, repeat after me.

02:03:19.026 --> 02:03:19.996
MARISHA: Yes.

02:03:19.996 --> 02:03:23.567
TRAVIS: In exchange for food, protect these
lands.

02:03:23.567 --> 02:03:31.526
MARISHA: Galdric. In exchange for food, shelter,
and a cozy fire every once in awhile--

02:03:31.526 --> 02:03:35.445
TRAVIS: I didn't say that shit. I didn't say that.
He's a wolf. He doesn't need those.

02:03:35.445 --> 02:03:37.921
MARISHA: Patrol these lands.

02:03:37.921 --> 02:03:39.197
LAURA: Protect these lands.

02:03:39.197 --> 02:03:40.683
MARISHA: Protect these lands.

02:03:40.683 --> 02:03:44.822
TRAVIS: (quietly) Holy shit.

02:03:44.822 --> 02:03:47.411
MATT: "For how long?"

02:03:47.411 --> 02:03:50.573
LAURA: (laughs) He already asked that.

02:03:50.573 --> 02:03:52.401
MARISHA: Why does he want details? Why does the
dog want--

02:03:52.401 --> 02:03:54.907
LAURA: As long as we need you to.

02:03:54.907 --> 02:03:57.675
TRAVIS: No, no. A great danger approaches.

02:03:57.675 --> 02:03:59.084
TALIESIN: Until the danger has passed.

02:03:59.084 --> 02:04:00.560
TRAVIS: You'll know it when it comes.

02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:04.814
MARISHA: (clears throat) A great danger--

02:04:04.814 --> 02:04:07.122
LAURA: Approaches!

02:04:07.122 --> 02:04:17.700
MARISHA: Approaches! A great danger approaches.
Your service is required until that danger--

02:04:17.700 --> 02:04:19.132
TALIESIN: Has passed.

02:04:19.132 --> 02:04:26.314
MARISHA: Has passed! Is no longer in effect.
You'll know. You'll know, because they're fucking

02:04:26.314 --> 02:04:32.865
dragons, man. You'll know. Protect--

02:04:32.865 --> 02:04:46.377
TRAVIS: I walk over and put my hand over Keyleth's
mouth. You stay. We feed you. Is there a tavern or

02:04:46.377 --> 02:04:48.474
a butcher shop or something nearby?

02:04:48.474 --> 02:04:56.084
MATT: There is a butcher. As you're having this
thought, however, Galdric turns back over to you

02:04:56.084 --> 02:05:01.298
and says, "I can feed myself."

02:05:01.298 --> 02:05:02.977
LAURA: Yeah, you can.

02:05:02.977 --> 02:05:06.352
MATT: "But I will watch until this danger has
passed."

02:05:06.352 --> 02:05:07.887
LAURA: Awesome.

02:05:07.887 --> 02:05:09.361
MATT: "Then am I free to go?"

02:05:09.361 --> 02:05:13.687
MARISHA: Then you are free to go.

02:05:13.687 --> 02:05:22.070
MATT: "Very well. I grow tired of service. I wait
too long." And the wolf looks at you, gives you

02:05:22.070 --> 02:05:25.003
like an acknowledgement, and then walks off into
the woods.

02:05:25.003 --> 02:05:26.213
LAURA: Bye, buddy!

02:05:26.213 --> 02:05:28.767
MARISHA: Thanks, Galdric. Appreciate it, man.

02:05:28.767 --> 02:05:32.744
LAURA: Man, that's a cool-looking wolf.

02:05:32.744 --> 02:05:36.142
MARISHA: I look at Grog. How was that? Did that
sound okay?

02:05:36.142 --> 02:05:38.675
TRAVIS: That was the dumbest thing I've ever
heard.

02:05:38.675 --> 02:05:41.485
(laughter)

02:05:41.485 --> 02:05:42.964
TALIESIN: You did good, you did good.

02:05:42.964 --> 02:05:44.316
SAM: I thought she did very well.

02:05:44.316 --> 02:05:50.421
MARISHA: Thank you. It really liked you. You
should learn how to talk to animals.

02:05:50.421 --> 02:05:52.090
LAURA: What is that? What is that you have? What
is that?

02:05:52.090 --> 02:05:56.332
TALIESIN: I'm holding onto the Raven's Slumber
jewel at the moment.

02:05:56.332 --> 02:05:58.046
SAM: The thing that can capture evil.

02:05:58.046 --> 02:06:02.100
TALIESIN: It's empty now, and do you know what I
bet would fit in it very nicely?

02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:04.821
TRAVIS: Me.

02:06:04.821 --> 02:06:13.357
LAURA: And we can carry him around and then pop
him out. Wait, okay, wait. Is it going to hurt

02:06:13.357 --> 02:06:15.058
him? Does it hurt him? Is it like, it's bad?

02:06:15.058 --> 02:06:19.816
SAM: Not only does it not hurt him, he does not
age or feel any pain.

02:06:19.816 --> 02:06:21.824
TRAVIS: A willing creature need not make a saving
throw.

02:06:21.824 --> 02:06:24.531
TALIESIN: It's automatic, and no time passes.

02:06:24.531 --> 02:06:30.475
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try it, and I'm going to
try it, and just to see how he likes it. If he's

02:06:30.475 --> 02:06:31.743
okay with it.

02:06:31.743 --> 02:06:32.589
MATT: Okay.

02:06:32.589 --> 02:06:33.710
LAURA: Hey, buddy, come here.

02:06:33.710 --> 02:06:36.515
MATT: As you turn around and look, you see there's
a small puddle on the ground where Trinket has

02:06:36.515 --> 02:06:41.751
vomited up. He's pushing dirt over it.

02:06:41.751 --> 02:06:47.147
TRAVIS: Yeah, you got to teach him to quit
rummaging, that is really foul.

02:06:47.147 --> 02:06:51.146
LAURA: What was that? Trinket, what did you eat?
Don't eat the puke. Do not eat the puke.

02:06:51.146 --> 02:06:52.178
Come here.

02:06:52.178 --> 02:06:53.783
MATT: Trinket's like scraping dirt over it.

02:06:53.783 --> 02:06:55.445
TRAVIS: Got a carrot on your chin.

02:06:55.445 --> 02:07:06.704
LAURA: Trinket. Do you want to go for a ride? You
like rides? Yeah? You want to go for one? All

02:07:06.704 --> 02:07:11.362
right, sit still. This'll be fun. I don't know how
to use it.

02:07:11.362 --> 02:07:13.245
TALIESIN: Just point, yep.

02:07:13.245 --> 02:07:15.267
LAURA: I point to him with the--

02:07:15.267 --> 02:07:17.876
SAM: You should probably say something cool.

02:07:17.876 --> 02:07:22.686
LAURA: By the power vested in me, I now pronounce
you my Pokemon.

02:07:22.686 --> 02:07:28.072
(laughter)

02:07:28.072 --> 02:07:37.764
MATT: Words be damned. It takes you an action or
so to activate the crystal, but as you do, Trinket

02:07:37.764 --> 02:07:43.995
gives a confused look before Trinket's shadow
seems to crawl up his legs until it forms into

02:07:43.995 --> 02:07:50.089
this circle, this dark core, roughly half the size of
Trinket's form, before it

02:07:50.089 --> 02:07:51.344
shoots into the crystal.

02:07:51.344 --> 02:07:53.697
LAURA: Is he about this size, but I don't like
that one, is he about this size?

02:07:53.697 --> 02:07:57.534
MATT: A little larger than that before he goes
into the crystal, but once he's in the crystal,

02:07:57.534 --> 02:07:58.630
it's small.

02:07:58.630 --> 02:07:59.738
LAURA: Oh, it's a little crystal?

02:07:59.738 --> 02:08:01.321
LIAM: Trinkachu, I choose you.

02:08:01.321 --> 02:08:05.322
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh. That's really fun.
Okay. How do I let him go?

02:08:05.322 --> 02:08:08.942
MARISHA: I think you-- yeah.

02:08:08.942 --> 02:08:10.314
LAURA: I release you.

02:08:10.314 --> 02:08:16.252
MATT: Okay. As you do that, once again the same
dark energy you saw earlier spills out and hits

02:08:16.252 --> 02:08:22.943
the ground in front of you, and from that dark
shadow area Trinket's form emerges, standing there

02:08:22.943 --> 02:08:24.579
looking really confused.

02:08:24.579 --> 02:08:27.933
LAURA: How was it? Did it hurt? Can you talk to
him? You can still talk to him. Talk to him. Ask

02:08:27.933 --> 02:08:28.837
him if it hurt.

02:08:28.837 --> 02:08:31.154
MATT: (vomiting noises) Vomits a little bit more
on the ground.

02:08:31.154 --> 02:08:32.483
LAURA: Well, that's not good.

02:08:32.483 --> 02:08:35.906
MARISHA: You know, sometimes the teleportation
makes you lose your lunch.

02:08:35.906 --> 02:08:37.296
LAURA: Ask him how he's doing.

02:08:37.296 --> 02:08:39.343
MARISHA: Trinket? You all right buddy? You all
right, there?

02:08:39.343 --> 02:08:41.264
MATT: "Feeling sick."

02:08:41.264 --> 02:08:43.878
LAURA: Ask him how the little car ride was, ask
him if he liked the ride.

02:08:43.878 --> 02:08:46.528
MARISHA: How was the ride? Did you feel all right?
How was--?

02:08:46.528 --> 02:08:47.822
MATT: "Yeah?"

02:08:47.822 --> 02:08:51.326
LAURA: Okay, would you mind, ask him if he'd mind
doing that on occasion, you know, whenever

02:08:51.363 --> 02:08:52.625
I need him to.

02:08:52.625 --> 02:08:54.192
MARISHA: What was it like in there? Was it--?

02:08:54.192 --> 02:08:55.535
MATT: "I don't remember."

02:08:55.535 --> 02:08:57.675
MARISHA: Okay, that's good, that's good. Would you
mind--

02:08:57.675 --> 02:08:59.527
LAURA: Ask him if he cares if I do it again, ask
him if he cares.

02:08:59.527 --> 02:09:02.981
MARISHA: Would you mind doing that, you know,
frequently? On occasion.

02:09:02.981 --> 02:09:04.560
MATT "If she wants me to, okay."

02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:10.148
LAURA: What did he say, what did he say? He looked
really cute when he said something.

02:09:10.148 --> 02:09:15.495
MARISHA: You have a lot of men who will do
anything for you.

02:09:15.495 --> 02:09:20.716
LAURA: Oh, buddy! I go and hug him really tight
and scratch his ears.

02:09:20.716 --> 02:09:22.370
MATT: You do, and avoid the little bit of--

02:09:22.370 --> 02:09:30.462
LAURA: --vomit on, I don't even care! Oh my gosh,
thank you! This is the best, this is the best and

02:09:30.462 --> 02:09:33.344
we can travel with him, we can climb with him, we
can sneak around.

02:09:33.344 --> 02:09:36.209
SAM: Hey, and if Trinket isn't in it, you can also
use it to capture baddies.

02:09:36.209 --> 02:09:38.332
LAURA: I know, it's great!

02:09:38.332 --> 02:09:42.422
TALIESIN: And because of the way that the
projection works, you could also in theory capture

02:09:42.422 --> 02:09:46.208
a baddie and then let them loose off a cliff and
watch them drop.

02:09:46.208 --> 02:09:48.707
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:09:48.707 --> 02:09:50.261
MARISHA: Oh my god, you're right.

02:09:50.261 --> 02:09:52.446
TALIESIN: It's very convenient.

02:09:52.446 --> 02:09:56.255
LAURA: Oh my gosh. Okay.

02:09:56.255 --> 02:09:59.264
MATT: So. You have a crystal, you've set a wolf on
a path.

02:09:59.264 --> 02:10:00.489
SAM: Where are we going next?

02:10:00.489 --> 02:10:01.966
MATT: Where are you going now?

02:10:01.966 --> 02:10:03.406
TALIESIN: Your home, I imagine.

02:10:03.406 --> 02:10:04.801
LAURA: Don't we need to--oh, yeah.

02:10:04.801 --> 02:10:06.222
SAM: What's our to-do list?

02:10:06.222 --> 02:10:11.300
MARISHA: We don't have to worry about it. We can,
it's fine.

02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:12.859
TALIESIN: Fire Ashari it is.

02:10:12.859 --> 02:10:15.302
SAM: Wait, wait, wait. What are the things that we
need to do?

02:10:15.302 --> 02:10:16.912
LAURA: We need to check in on Keyleth's family.

02:10:16.912 --> 02:10:18.336
SAM: Cobalt Reserve, Ashari.

02:10:18.336 --> 02:10:20.513
LAURA: Grog's family.

02:10:20.513 --> 02:10:23.972
SAM: Did we already take care of Osysa's mate,
Frostweald?

02:10:23.972 --> 02:10:26.085
LAURA: No, but that's down--

02:10:26.085 --> 02:10:27.654
TALIESIN: That's far.

02:10:27.654 --> 02:10:29.462
MARISHA: That's the other Vestige, correct?

02:10:29.462 --> 02:10:31.294
LAURA: Yes, that's over by Grog's family.

02:10:31.294 --> 02:10:33.239
MATT: That's information about the Vestiges.

02:10:33.239 --> 02:10:34.875
SAM: We need to steal an airship.

02:10:34.875 --> 02:10:37.221
TALIESIN: I agree, that's still very important.

02:10:37.221 --> 02:10:39.951
TRAVIS: I can't remember where, what--

02:10:39.951 --> 02:10:41.773
LAURA: They were by Kraghammer.

02:10:41.773 --> 02:10:45.236
TRAVIS: Thank you. I'm having terrible hiccups.

02:10:45.236 --> 02:10:52.520
SAM: What about, we need to find Kaylie at
some point. We also need to, who's gone, where's

02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:54.662
Allu-- where's Ki-- where's people?

02:10:54.662 --> 02:10:57.917
LAURA: Allura should be here in like a day. She
should be here very soon.

02:10:57.917 --> 02:11:00.152
TRAVIS: What's close to here? (hiccups)

02:11:00.152 --> 02:11:02.994
TALIESIN: Nothing's close, we're specifically far
away from everything.

02:11:02.994 --> 02:11:05.290
MARISHA: But we can go wherever we want as long as
we've been there before.

02:11:05.290 --> 02:11:08.817
TRAVIS: Well, we should definitely go to the Fire
Ashari.

02:11:08.817 --> 02:11:10.258
TALIESIN: Fire Ashari is the next--

02:11:10.258 --> 02:11:11.714
LAURA: We should go to the Fire Ashari.

02:11:11.714 --> 02:11:13.679
MARISHA: Oh god, I'm immediately nauseous.

02:11:13.679 --> 02:11:15.268
MATT: (bear noises)

02:11:15.268 --> 02:11:16.610
LIAM: That's two of us.

02:11:16.610 --> 02:11:21.453
MARISHA: Oh, Trinket, buddy. What time is it?

02:11:21.453 --> 02:11:23.105
LAURA: (laughs) Do you need some water?

02:11:23.105 --> 02:11:27.575
MATT: It's still, with the travel to and from,
it's middle afternoon, like one o'clock in the

02:11:27.575 --> 02:11:28.700
afternoon.

02:11:28.700 --> 02:11:30.222
TALIESIN: Take it.

02:11:30.222 --> 02:11:33.628
SAM: If we're going to go, do we need anything
before we leave? We got everything we need?

02:11:33.628 --> 02:11:37.400
Potions and stuff? Want to buy some meat for your
cooler?

02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:41.390
LAURA: Yeah, let's get some meat.

02:11:41.390 --> 02:11:44.974
MATT: It's pretty easy to go ahead and procure it,
five gold of meat will fill that thing.

02:11:44.974 --> 02:11:46.025
LAURA: Yeah!

02:11:46.025 --> 02:11:48.625
MATT: So go ahead and mark five gold off your
paper.

02:11:48.625 --> 02:11:50.813
SAM: How much, could I buy a medical kit
somewhere?

02:11:50.813 --> 02:11:53.634
MATT: Yeah, you could find a general store and
purchase a medical kit.

02:11:53.634 --> 02:11:54.779
SAM: How much is that?

02:11:54.779 --> 02:11:56.352
MATT: I'm going to look that up right now.

02:11:56.352 --> 02:11:58.201
SAM: All right, whatever, I've got it.

02:11:58.201 --> 02:12:00.873
TALIESIN: It's nifty that you have a book that
tells you how much something like that costs.

02:12:00.873 --> 02:12:04.746
MATT: Imagine that. It's like it's a handbook of
some kind, it's crazy.

02:12:04.746 --> 02:12:07.055
MARISHA: Does anyone have any fire-resistant
items?

02:12:07.055 --> 02:12:08.411
LAURA: He does.

02:12:08.411 --> 02:12:09.577
LIAM: I do.

02:12:09.577 --> 02:12:10.824
LAURA: Put it on.

02:12:10.824 --> 02:12:13.228
MARISHA: I might pick up some fire resistant
potions as well.

02:12:13.228 --> 02:12:20.227
TRAVIS: I have this black iron plate that I
haven't used ever. 'While wearing this heavy plate

02:12:20.227 --> 02:12:22.969
'armor, the bearer gains resistance to any fire
damage.'

02:12:22.969 --> 02:12:25.180
MATT: Five gold for an herbalist's kit for you.

02:12:25.180 --> 02:12:27.246
LAURA: Oh, plate armor, none of us can wear it but
Pike.

02:12:27.246 --> 02:12:28.871
MATT: An herbalist's kit, like five gold.

02:12:28.871 --> 02:12:30.493
SAM: Can that stabilize people?

02:12:30.493 --> 02:12:32.592
MATT: If used with a medicine check, yeah.

02:12:32.592 --> 02:12:35.550
LAURA: Okay, I have this, which I can't wear.

02:12:35.550 --> 02:12:37.153
TALIESIN: What is that?

02:12:37.153 --> 02:12:41.798
LAURA: It's a purple and black robe. It was Lady
Briarwood's robes.

02:12:41.798 --> 02:12:43.092
TALIESIN: What does it do?

02:12:43.092 --> 02:12:47.836
LAURA: Clings to nearby darkness as you walk.
While wearing this robe, you gain resistance to

02:12:47.836 --> 02:12:52.144
piercing damage. Anybody need pierce resistance
that can wear robes?

02:12:52.144 --> 02:12:57.638
TALIESIN: I'm pretty reasonable.

02:12:57.638 --> 02:13:00.164
SAM: Do I wear robes?

02:13:00.164 --> 02:13:02.201
MATT: Robes would be worn instead of your armor.

02:13:02.201 --> 02:13:03.479
SAM: No thanks.

02:13:03.479 --> 02:13:09.744
LAURA: What about Gloves of Missile Snaring? That
appeal to anyone?

02:13:09.744 --> 02:13:11.540
SAM: Missile snaring? What does that do?

02:13:11.540 --> 02:13:17.732
LAURA: These gloves seem to almost meld into your
hands when you don them, and when a ranged weapon

02:13:17.732 --> 02:13:22.479
attack hits you, you can use your reaction to
reduce the damage by 1d10 plus your dexterity

02:13:22.479 --> 02:13:28.355
modifier provided that you have a free hand. If
you reduce the damage to zero, you can catch the

02:13:28.355 --> 02:13:31.195
missile if it's small enough to hold in that
hand.

02:13:31.195 --> 02:13:32.703
TALIESIN: Does it require attuning?

02:13:32.703 --> 02:13:34.504
MARISHA: They're pretty sleek.

02:13:34.504 --> 02:13:36.653
LAURA: It requires two, no it just requires one
free hand.

02:13:36.653 --> 02:13:38.124
TALIESIN: Yes, but does it require attuning?

02:13:38.124 --> 02:13:40.360
LAURA: Yes it does, it requires attuning.

02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:42.453
TALIESIN: I might be attuned out at this point.

02:13:42.453 --> 02:13:45.355
LAURA: Anybody? I feel like that could be cool for
you, Scanlan.

02:13:45.355 --> 02:13:47.642
SAM: I think I can take it?

02:13:47.642 --> 02:13:52.817
TALIESIN: What's your dex? Your dexterity is not
very-- actually, it might work out well for me,

02:13:52.817 --> 02:13:54.193
weirdly enough.

02:13:54.193 --> 02:13:55.548
MARISHA: Are you fully attuned?

02:13:55.548 --> 02:13:58.344
TALIESIN: I can undo something that I'm not
using.

02:13:58.344 --> 02:14:03.967
MARISHA: Percy, you have access here in Whitestone
to alchemy supplies, correct?

02:14:03.967 --> 02:14:09.743
TALIESIN: Matt, I have access to alchemy supplies
here in Whitestone, correct?

02:14:09.743 --> 02:14:14.635
MATT: (laughs) I mean, there are elements of your
initial workshop I guess, that a lot of supplies

02:14:14.635 --> 02:14:18.394
have been cannibalized but a few things can be
pieced together. Plus there was a lot of

02:14:18.394 --> 02:14:24.312
alchemical elements and tools that were utilized
in the subterranean tunnels as part of the

02:14:24.312 --> 02:14:30.922
refinement process for the whitestone residuum,
the large vats of acid that were distilled by the

02:14:30.922 --> 02:14:35.063
Briarwoods while they were here, and there are
other elements of their own tinkering in the

02:14:35.063 --> 02:14:39.034
alchemical arts that remain scattered throughout
the castle. So yeah, you can definitely find

02:14:39.034 --> 02:14:42.491
enough to tinker with if you want.

02:14:42.491 --> 02:14:46.880
MARISHA: I mean, we could take the rest of the
evening and I can attempt to make some fire

02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:48.590
resist potions.

02:14:48.590 --> 02:14:49.933
SAM: Eh.

02:14:49.933 --> 02:14:54.363
TRAVIS: All right, here's what I'm thinking,
right? I mean, if we go after my herd, we're in

02:14:54.363 --> 02:15:01.101
for a fight. A big one. If we go to your Fire
Ashari, we're doing recon and hopefully learning

02:15:01.101 --> 02:15:02.271
something, right?

02:15:02.271 --> 02:15:06.962
MARISHA: Well, we're going to be in for a fight at
the Fire Ashari as well because there's a giant

02:15:06.962 --> 02:15:12.390
sunder in the fire plane, and last time I checked
there were fire imps and elementals pouring

02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:13.978
through there.

02:15:13.978 --> 02:15:15.462
TRAVIS: Are those bad?

02:15:15.462 --> 02:15:16.433
TALIESIN: Eh.

02:15:16.433 --> 02:15:17.885
MARISHA: They're annoying

02:15:17.885 --> 02:15:22.100
TALIESIN: As long as we're quick we can go about
it.

02:15:22.100 --> 02:15:23.676
MARISHA: Well.

02:15:23.676 --> 02:15:25.234
SAM: What's our mission?

02:15:25.234 --> 02:15:30.130
TRAVIS: You really want to get the rest of the
testicles of--

02:15:30.130 --> 02:15:35.452
MARISHA: I mean, we could theoretically see if there are
survivors and I can attempt to close the tear in

02:15:35.452 --> 02:15:43.187
the plane. I don't know if I can do that. However,
I don't know anyone else particularly more

02:15:43.187 --> 02:15:45.117
qualified to attempt it.

02:15:45.117 --> 02:15:48.728
TRAVIS: Allura or that bearded dude.

02:15:48.728 --> 02:15:52.032
MARISHA: We're talking about the Fire Ashari and
possibly what to do there.

02:15:52.032 --> 02:15:54.813
LAURA: Oh.

02:15:54.813 --> 02:15:57.361
MARISHA: We can go and look for survivors--

02:15:57.361 --> 02:15:59.564
LAURA: And bring them here.

02:15:59.564 --> 02:16:02.886
MARISHA: And someone should probably close the
tear in the fire plane.

02:16:02.886 --> 02:16:05.151
LAURA: Should we wait for Allura then, before we
go?

02:16:05.151 --> 02:16:09.061
TRAVIS: Well, if there are survivors, they might
not be that way for very long if we don't go.

02:16:09.061 --> 02:16:11.782
LAURA: They've been there for a while already.

02:16:11.782 --> 02:16:13.092
MARISHA: If there are survivors--

02:16:13.092 --> 02:16:14.503
LAURA: Then they're surviving.

02:16:14.503 --> 02:16:19.078
MARISHA: They've survived. I agree. It's not going
to be pretty.

02:16:19.078 --> 02:16:20.938
TALIESIN: I know you don't want to go.

02:16:20.938 --> 02:16:22.115
MARISHA: I really don't.

02:16:22.115 --> 02:16:33.542
TALIESIN: But we need to go. I say we take the
rest of the day. You make your potions, we leave

02:16:33.542 --> 02:16:34.665
first thing in the morning.

02:16:34.665 --> 02:16:36.282
LAURA: Wait for Allura, hopefully she'll be here
by then.

02:16:36.282 --> 02:16:40.197
TALIESIN: Maybe Allura will join us by tomorrow
morning. If not, we teleport over.

02:16:40.197 --> 02:16:43.868
MATT: Okay, you guys are going to rest for the
evening?

02:16:43.868 --> 02:16:51.217
TRAVIS: Wait, hold on, is there like a house of
entertainment in Whitestone? I know it's just

02:16:51.217 --> 02:16:53.348
getting back on its feet but you know.

02:16:53.348 --> 02:16:55.313
MATT: That would be a question more for Percival.

02:16:55.313 --> 02:17:02.639
TRAVIS: Percy? I'm having a bit of a soul struggle
and I'm wondering if I might bend

02:17:02.639 --> 02:17:04.303
your ear for a moment.

02:17:04.303 --> 02:17:05.207
TALIESIN: Sure.

02:17:05.207 --> 02:17:06.838
TRAVIS: Yeah, could I speak to you over here?

02:17:06.838 --> 02:17:07.811
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

02:17:07.811 --> 02:17:11.018
TRAVIS: Right, so, like, I want to get my freak
on.

02:17:11.018 --> 02:17:13.882
TALIESIN: I don't feel that way about you.

02:17:13.882 --> 02:17:15.070
(laughter)

02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:16.394
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I, I'm sorry.

02:17:16.394 --> 02:17:17.790
TALIESIN: I mean, you're very attractive.

02:17:17.790 --> 02:17:21.917
TRAVIS: That was very unclear. So I know this
is like your home and stuff and you might not have

02:17:21.917 --> 02:17:24.627
been aware of it, but they have these houses where
like....

02:17:24.627 --> 02:17:28.250
TALIESIN: Oh, where you get your freak on!

02:17:28.250 --> 02:17:29.109
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:17:29.109 --> 02:17:31.115
TALIESIN: Yes. Yes, we have them.

02:17:31.115 --> 02:17:33.786
TRAVIS: Oh good, do you think they're still in
order?

02:17:33.786 --> 02:17:36.520
TALIESIN: Oh, I imagine so.

02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:37.967
TRAVIS: Could you point me in that direction?

02:17:37.967 --> 02:17:41.153
TALIESIN: No, I have no idea where they are. I do
know that they exist. I actually had things to do

02:17:41.153 --> 02:17:42.792
here. I didn't have time for these.

02:17:42.792 --> 02:17:46.230
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, me too, important things. I was
thinking for Scanlan in case he gets bored, you

02:17:46.230 --> 02:17:48.894
know, you've got to keep him focused.

02:17:48.894 --> 02:17:52.106
TALIESIN: I wouldn't actually know where any of
these places were, would I?

02:17:52.106 --> 02:17:55.364
MATT: No, and those that did exist in this town
have not been...

02:17:55.364 --> 02:18:00.137
TALIESIN: I figured as much. I'm just fucking with
him. Okay. No.

02:18:00.137 --> 02:18:03.724
TRAVIS: Oh, okay, well, I'll let Scanlan know.
Just keep it between you and me 'cause he's very

02:18:03.724 --> 02:18:05.602
sensitive about these things.

02:18:05.602 --> 02:18:10.771
TALIESIN: Your secret is safe with my
indifference. That's fine.

02:18:10.771 --> 02:18:13.951
TRAVIS: Well, my, my, indifference

02:18:13.951 --> 02:18:15.851
TALIESIN: I know you do.

02:18:15.851 --> 02:18:16.734
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:18:16.734 --> 02:18:17.841
TALIESIN: You're wonderful.

02:18:17.841 --> 02:18:19.807
MARISHA: Can I start telling that to people in
real life?

02:18:19.807 --> 02:18:21.807
TALIESIN: Yes you can. I do it all the time.

02:18:21.807 --> 02:18:23.517
MARISHA: Yes. Your secret is safe with my
indifference.

02:18:23.517 --> 02:18:25.190
TRAVIS: Okay. I'm going to rest.

02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:30.439
SAM: Before we set off on this, is there anything
closer or more pressing? I don't actually know why

02:18:30.439 --> 02:18:33.239
we're going to her place, but I'm fine with it.

02:18:33.239 --> 02:18:40.171
MARISHA: To look for survivors and close the giant
tear in the fire plane that evil, well not evil,

02:18:40.171 --> 02:18:42.462
fiery entities are pouring through.

02:18:42.462 --> 02:18:44.026
TALIESIN: It's a hellmouth, it's basically a
hellmouth.

02:18:44.026 --> 02:18:45.532
TRAVIS: It's either that or we go goliath
hunting.

02:18:45.532 --> 02:18:46.782
LAURA: That's next.

02:18:46.782 --> 02:18:49.337
TALIESIN: But this is quick, this is something
that we can knock off the list.

02:18:49.337 --> 02:18:50.741
SAM: All right, let's knock it off.

02:18:50.741 --> 02:18:52.565
TRAVIS: Yeah, right, let's just check it off.

02:18:52.565 --> 02:18:58.661
LIAM: As we're walking through town, do I see any
weaponsmiths?

02:18:58.661 --> 02:19:02.329
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:19:02.329 --> 02:19:03.647
LIAM: Okay.

02:19:03.647 --> 02:19:07.121
TALIESIN: I'll help you make the potions.

02:19:07.121 --> 02:19:11.194
LIAM: 21.

02:19:11.194 --> 02:19:16.247
MATT: Okay, that'll help cut down on the time. 21?
There are two functional smiths left in the town.

02:19:16.247 --> 02:19:24.970
There were two more than that overall, that were
more like blacksmithy, but they both unfortunately

02:19:24.970 --> 02:19:29.511
lost their lives in the insurrection. But there
are two functional blacksmiths in this, yeah.

02:19:29.511 --> 02:19:32.420
LIAM: And one's nearby, to pass through?

02:19:32.420 --> 02:19:35.573
MATT: About a ten-minute diversion.

02:19:35.573 --> 02:19:37.059
LIAM: I'm splitting off from the group.

02:19:37.059 --> 02:19:38.493
MATT: Okay.

02:19:38.493 --> 02:19:39.976
SAM: We've got to get out of here.

02:19:39.976 --> 02:19:42.960
LIAM: One's in front of me now?

02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:49.234
MATT: Well, you find your way to-- it's a small
blacksmith, and most of it's outside. Though the

02:19:49.234 --> 02:19:57.120
day is growing late, you do see an older
gentleman, long, tattered grey hair pulled into a

02:19:57.120 --> 02:20:01.290
very tight bun in the back and a beard that is
actually tied off to the side. Otherwise it would

02:20:01.290 --> 02:20:07.117
be hanging down into his work. He's wearing
soot-covered clothes, big leather apron, leather

02:20:07.117 --> 02:20:13.655
gloves, and he's currently in the process of (ping
ping) turning over and hammering out a piece of

02:20:13.655 --> 02:20:15.760
orange glowing steel.

02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:20.204
LIAM: Excuse me, sorry to interrupt, I have a very
simple request.

02:20:20.204 --> 02:20:24.040
MATT: He doesn't stop. He seems to, he
acknowledges your presence but he's still working

02:20:24.040 --> 02:20:26.526
as he's listening. (smithing sounds)

02:20:26.526 --> 02:20:30.407
LIAM: I have six gold burning a hole in my pocket.
I'm not looking for anything simple. Do you have a

02:20:30.407 --> 02:20:32.921
short sword? A regular old shortsword.

02:20:32.921 --> 02:20:37.934
MATT: (ting) He looks over at you. "If that's what
you're looking for, on that wall over there we've

02:20:37.934 --> 02:20:41.243
"got two shortswords." (ting)

02:20:41.243 --> 02:20:43.613
LIAM: What's the difference between the two that I
can see?

02:20:43.613 --> 02:20:47.724
MATT: (smithing sounds) That you can see? Make a
perception check.

02:20:47.724 --> 02:20:54.564
LIAM: 22.

02:20:54.564 --> 02:21:01.346
MATT: Looking over them both, from this distance,
they're both made with different hilt designs and

02:21:01.346 --> 02:21:05.100
different pommel designs, the grips are a little
different but other than that the blades are

02:21:05.100 --> 02:21:06.519
pretty much identical.

02:21:06.519 --> 02:21:11.113
LIAM: I grab one off the wall. I slap down six
gold, which I know is way too much and say, thank

02:21:11.113 --> 02:21:14.259
you sir. Pelor lives here. And I walk away.

02:21:14.259 --> 02:21:16.782
MATT: Okay, as you start walking away he goes,
"Hey."

02:21:16.782 --> 02:21:17.815
LIAM: Yeah?

02:21:17.815 --> 02:21:21.182
MATT: "You're going to pay proper for that
shortsword."

02:21:21.182 --> 02:21:22.982
LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry. How much does it cost?

02:21:22.982 --> 02:21:24.825
MATT: "12 gold pieces."

02:21:24.825 --> 02:21:30.895
LIAM: My apologies. 12?

02:21:30.895 --> 02:21:33.714
MATT: "12 gold pieces, friend."

02:21:33.714 --> 02:21:39.414
LIAM: So I put down six. I put down another 14. I
really apologize. I was just confused.

02:21:39.414 --> 02:21:44.368
MATT: "It's all right. No harm no foul." Takes the
gold and scoops it and puts it into his pouch.

02:21:44.368 --> 02:21:46.676
"Have a good day."

02:21:46.676 --> 02:21:53.116
LIAM: I walk down the street going like-- it's
big.

02:21:53.116 --> 02:21:57.909
MATT: It's much bigger than you're used to, but
it's got a fine balance to it and it's well-made.

02:21:57.909 --> 02:22:01.065
All right, so as you guys have all--

02:22:01.065 --> 02:22:02.826
LAURA: I've got an opal dagger you could have
used.

02:22:02.826 --> 02:22:04.271
LIAM: I don't need your dagger.

02:22:04.271 --> 02:22:05.738
TALIESIN: We're going to make our potions?

02:22:05.738 --> 02:22:07.410
MATT: Yes, yes. All right, so.

02:22:07.410 --> 02:22:09.560
MARISHA: I have another question.

02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:11.934
MATT: What is your other question?

02:22:11.934 --> 02:22:18.523
MARISHA: Before we all go to bed tonight can we
get like a fuckton of the green stone under

02:22:18.523 --> 02:22:19.552
Whitestone?

02:22:19.552 --> 02:22:20.893
TALIESIN: There's really not a lot of it.

02:22:20.893 --> 02:22:25.246
MARISHA: Say like $1,000 worth and maybe have like
a real nice Heroes' Feast before tomorrow?

02:22:25.246 --> 02:22:26.447
LIAM: Wise as fuck.

02:22:26.447 --> 02:22:29.861
LAURA: Or in the morning.

02:22:29.861 --> 02:22:31.863
LIAM: Heroes' Breakfast.

02:22:31.863 --> 02:22:35.277
MARISHA: I've got to do it at night, because I
have to Tree Stride in the morning.

02:22:35.277 --> 02:22:40.862
MATT: You can choose either to create the potion
or to mine the residuum for the evening. You

02:22:40.862 --> 02:22:45.404
cannot do both. Both are time, like, to pull that
material from the-- because most of it that

02:22:45.404 --> 02:22:51.283
remains has been already embedded within the
ziggurat beneath. You would actually have to

02:22:51.283 --> 02:22:53.469
physically chip it from the structure.

02:22:53.469 --> 02:22:54.905
LAURA: I have a plan, Keyleth.

02:22:54.905 --> 02:22:55.708
MARISHA: Yes?

02:22:55.708 --> 02:23:07.192
LAURA: We will cover the 1,000 gold from our own
party funds and have someone here mine some shit

02:23:07.192 --> 02:23:09.241
for us and give it to us later.

02:23:09.241 --> 02:23:13.194
MARISHA: I like that plan, yeah. Sounds good to
me.

02:23:13.194 --> 02:23:14.703
SAM: How about the wolf?

02:23:14.703 --> 02:23:18.026
TALIESIN: So potions.

02:23:18.026 --> 02:23:23.780
LAURA: Percival, do you have people here who can
mine? Looking for work, people--?

02:23:23.780 --> 02:23:25.470
MARISHA: Yeah, sure, why not?

02:23:25.470 --> 02:23:29.998
TALIESIN: I'll let them know that they should
start trying to pull the residuum out of the wall,

02:23:29.998 --> 02:23:32.048
but it's dangerous down there.

02:23:32.048 --> 02:23:33.151
LAURA: Yeah, it is.

02:23:33.151 --> 02:23:37.659
TALIESIN: And tampering with it is definitely...

02:23:37.659 --> 02:23:40.739
TRAVIS: Necessary.

02:23:40.739 --> 02:23:43.526
TALIESIN: Should be ginger. It would, I'm trying
to keep everything ginger down there.

02:23:43.526 --> 02:23:47.944
LAURA: So maybe we should take 1,000 gold just from
your family stores then, huh? That might be

02:23:47.944 --> 02:23:49.221
smarter.

02:23:49.221 --> 02:23:55.131
TALIESIN: We currently have 1,000 gold from my
family stores that are in the group treasury at

02:23:55.131 --> 02:23:56.152
the moment.

02:23:56.152 --> 02:24:00.025
LAURA: Oh, we do. No, that's 500. That was just
500. Just so you know.

02:24:00.025 --> 02:24:01.560
TALIESIN: I feel like it was more than that.

02:24:01.560 --> 02:24:03.016
LAURA: No, it was just 500.

02:24:03.016 --> 02:24:05.180
LIAM: Hey, de Rolo, do you remember what happened
yesterday?

02:24:05.180 --> 02:24:08.105
TALIESIN: He's not there.

02:24:08.105 --> 02:24:09.757
LAURA: Isn't he, though?

02:24:09.757 --> 02:24:12.119
TALIESIN: I was going to do such a nice
thing for you, but never mind now.

02:24:12.119 --> 02:24:15.594
LAURA: (laughs) No, no, no, do something really
nice for me.

02:24:15.594 --> 02:24:18.271
LIAM: Where did I go? Oh, I went to buy a
shortsword.

02:24:18.271 --> 02:24:20.680
TALIESIN: No, never mind. You went to buy a
shortsword.

02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:25.258
LAURA: Dear, dear, dear, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm
sorry. Do nice things. All right?

02:24:25.258 --> 02:24:29.293
TALIESIN: I'm trying to be gentle with my family
right now. They're taking on an awful lot.

02:24:29.293 --> 02:24:31.869
LAURA: You're right. They're taking on so many
people.

02:24:31.869 --> 02:24:34.637
TALIESIN: And we'll see what we can do.

02:24:34.637 --> 02:24:37.342
LIAM: I'd like to think you hear me in your mind.

02:24:37.342 --> 02:24:40.033
TALIESIN: Always fucking hear you in my mind.

02:24:40.033 --> 02:24:44.260
LAURA: Let's just use the damned party funds for
the time being. It's fine, Keyleth. This is a really

02:24:44.308 --> 02:24:45.755
important feast.

02:24:45.755 --> 02:24:48.605
TALIESIN: We're busy making potions.

02:24:48.605 --> 02:24:49.915
LAURA: All right.

02:24:49.915 --> 02:24:53.104
MATT: So you prepare a Heroes' Feast before you
begin this potion-creation process? Is that what I

02:24:53.104 --> 02:24:54.367
understand or not?

02:24:54.367 --> 02:24:55.324
LAURA: What?

02:24:55.324 --> 02:24:59.733
MARISHA: Can I make some potions and then, like, I
make dinner for us before we go to bed?

02:24:59.733 --> 02:25:05.251
MATT: It's going to take you about the length of a
day to create the potion, with his help it takes

02:25:05.251 --> 02:25:12.346
it to about half, so it'll be about 12 hours of
creating. Eight to 12 hours. So.

02:25:12.346 --> 02:25:13.637
TRAVIS: Pick one.

02:25:13.637 --> 02:25:14.882
TALIESIN: Pick one.

02:25:14.882 --> 02:25:16.574
MARISHA: I'll do a damn feast.

02:25:16.574 --> 02:25:17.731
TALIESIN: No potion?

02:25:17.731 --> 02:25:21.062
MATT: You can do the potion as well. The feast
only takes a moment to cast.

02:25:21.062 --> 02:25:23.151
MARISHA: All right, okay. Yeah.

02:25:23.151 --> 02:25:27.594
MATT: I'm just saying, be aware that you guys will
probably have, if you want to get a full rest

02:25:27.594 --> 02:25:31.304
after that potion creation process, you're going
to have to wait until like this time tomorrow,

02:25:31.304 --> 02:25:34.673
like late in the day to make your journey. Which
is fine, if you're willing to be patient about it.

02:25:34.673 --> 02:25:36.313
TRAVIS: Sure.

02:25:36.313 --> 02:25:40.132
MATT: Yes, no?

02:25:40.132 --> 02:25:43.364
TRAVIS: Say one, just say one.

02:25:43.364 --> 02:25:48.110
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do it, let's do it. Let's go
in prepared and then we can always rest on that side.

02:25:48.110 --> 02:25:50.239
MATT: Cool. For a fine, fine dinner.

02:25:50.239 --> 02:25:54.042
LAURA: Just want to make sure we feast right
before we leave so that it's most useful.

02:25:54.042 --> 02:26:00.634
MATT: All right, so. You, everyone else goes to
sleep while you and Percy work tirelessly through

02:26:00.634 --> 02:26:03.478
the night. If I could have you--

02:26:03.478 --> 02:26:04.920
LIAM: Fuck!

02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:09.372
MATT: (laughs) Just for the sake of it, I want you
to go ahead and make an arcana check.

02:26:09.372 --> 02:26:14.674
MARISHA: Aw, an arcana? Do I get advantage because
of my little skill in alchemy? I'm skilled in

02:26:14.674 --> 02:26:15.705
alchemy.

02:26:15.705 --> 02:26:18.007
MATT: Yeah. Oh, that's right you are, never mind,
go ahead and do that.

02:26:18.007 --> 02:26:21.997
MATT: Proficiency bonus, are you proficient in
alchemy?

02:26:21.997 --> 02:26:22.905
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:26:22.905 --> 02:26:26.696
MATT: So proficiency bonus, and for this, use
intellect modifier.

02:26:26.696 --> 02:26:36.508
MARISHA: Okay. Intellect, which makes it plus
seven. Do I have advan-- ooh, I rolled a natural 19.

02:26:36.508 --> 02:26:46.280
MATT: Okay. We'll say, for the fair cost of,
reduced due to the roll, 450 gold pieces, you

02:26:46.280 --> 02:26:49.145
create a potion of resistance of your choice of
resistance.

02:26:49.145 --> 02:26:50.317
MARISHA: Just one?

02:26:50.317 --> 02:26:51.330
MATT: Just one.

02:26:51.330 --> 02:26:52.117
MARISHA: Fire.

02:26:52.117 --> 02:26:53.128
MATT: It takes a long time, man.

02:26:53.128 --> 02:26:53.944
MARISHA: Fire!

02:26:53.944 --> 02:26:58.321
MATT: Fire, all right. You create a potion of fire
resistance. The materials cost you 450 gold to

02:26:58.321 --> 02:27:05.217
create, you finish it by about sunrise the next
day. Everyone else begins slowly waking up after

02:27:05.217 --> 02:27:07.606
the night's rest as you guys both, bags under your
eyes.

02:27:07.606 --> 02:27:11.635
LAURA: Oh, that was a good night's sleep, I tell
you what.

02:27:11.635 --> 02:27:12.793
TRAVIS: Seriously.

02:27:12.793 --> 02:27:13.666
SAM: Keyleth, could you--

02:27:13.666 --> 02:27:15.467
MARISHA: What? Oh, god, you snuck up on me.

02:27:15.467 --> 02:27:17.271
SAM: Could you make me some tea real quick?

02:27:17.271 --> 02:27:18.392
MARISHA: Scanlan.

02:27:18.392 --> 02:27:19.643
SAM: What?

02:27:19.643 --> 02:27:21.209
MARISHA: Go fuck yourself.

02:27:21.209 --> 02:27:22.644
SAM: What, you were up before me, I thought--

02:27:22.644 --> 02:27:28.213
TALIESIN: All right. All right, this is fine.

02:27:28.213 --> 02:27:29.437
MARISHA: This is fine.

02:27:29.437 --> 02:27:30.276
TALIESIN: This is good.

02:27:30.276 --> 02:27:31.129
MARISHA: This is great.

02:27:31.129 --> 02:27:34.729
MATT: You're doing a Heroes' Feast for breakfast,
then? Is that how it's working?

02:27:34.729 --> 02:27:40.353
MARISHA: I'll take a nap. I'll cook breakfast,
guys, good morning. Good morning!

02:27:40.353 --> 02:27:41.813
LAURA: Oh hey, good morning, Keyleth!

02:27:41.813 --> 02:27:45.608
SAM: Why don't you sleep during the day, we'll all
take our feast, and then blast off at night time?

02:27:45.608 --> 02:27:50.516
MARISHA: Because I have to teleport and cooking
this feast are both 6th-level spells and I can

02:27:50.516 --> 02:27:51.646
only do one of those a day.

02:27:51.646 --> 02:27:53.211
TRAVIS: Man, it's hard being a druid.

02:27:53.211 --> 02:27:55.367
LAURA: Can anybody else make a feast? That's
here?

02:27:55.367 --> 02:27:57.819
MARISHA: Pike. Pike. Pike?

02:27:57.819 --> 02:27:59.389
SAM: She's with Gilmore.

02:27:59.389 --> 02:28:01.099
TRAVIS: She's not here.

02:28:01.099 --> 02:28:04.698
LAURA: (sighs) I miss Pike.

02:28:04.698 --> 02:28:07.657
LIAM: We all miss Pike.

02:28:07.657 --> 02:28:10.128
MARISHA: I'll cook breakfast, guys.

02:28:10.128 --> 02:28:13.085
LAURA: No, I'll cook breakfast. No, I won't cook
breakfast.

02:28:13.085 --> 02:28:15.475
LIAM: That's a good idea, for you to not cook
breakfast.

02:28:15.475 --> 02:28:16.609
MATT: What's the plan?

02:28:16.609 --> 02:28:18.011
MARISHA: I'm cooking breakfast!

02:28:18.011 --> 02:28:21.218
MATT: Are you cooking breakfast or are you
summoning breakfast? That's my question.

02:28:21.218 --> 02:28:25.796
LAURA: Are you summoning breakfast and then you're
sleeping and then we're leaving?

02:28:25.796 --> 02:28:29.197
MARISHA: I'm summoning-- yes, I'm summoning
breakfast and then I'm sleeping.

02:28:29.197 --> 02:28:31.591
LAURA: And then you're sleeping and then we're
leaving as soon as you wake up.

02:28:31.591 --> 02:28:36.420
MATT: Okay, that's what I was wondering. We got
the answer, okay, cool. Hoo, today's been a slog.

02:28:36.420 --> 02:28:43.870
All right, so you go ahead and you use Heroes'
Feast, summoning forth a fantastical breakfast meal

02:28:43.870 --> 02:28:48.036
filled with coffee and eggs and everything you
would hope for, the finest materials.

02:28:48.036 --> 02:28:50.180
LAURA: Froot Loops!

02:28:50.180 --> 02:28:53.159
MATT: (laughs) Sure, Froot Loops is on the menu,
why not?

02:28:53.159 --> 02:28:54.460
TALIESIN: Lucky Charms.

02:28:54.460 --> 02:29:00.157
MATT: No Lucky Charms, sorry, those aren't
available on Tal'Dorei. But yes, all you guys take

02:29:00.157 --> 02:29:08.322
an hour to finish devouring this, you finish your
meal, all you guys get a 2d10 hit point maximum

02:29:08.322 --> 02:29:10.055
increase to your hit points.

02:29:10.055 --> 02:29:11.982
LAURA: Ooh, ooh, greens, greens!

02:29:11.982 --> 02:29:17.037
MATT: And immune to poison, frightened, and all
wisdom saving throws have advantage.

02:29:17.037 --> 02:29:18.867
TRAVIS: Damn!

02:29:18.867 --> 02:29:23.426
SAM: Advantage on wisdom.

02:29:23.426 --> 02:29:26.096
MATT: Yes, the usual.

02:29:26.096 --> 02:29:27.574
TRAVIS: Almost broke.

02:29:27.574 --> 02:29:28.871
MARISHA: And wisdom.

02:29:28.871 --> 02:29:30.360
LAURA: And you're immune to fear, right?

02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:33.257
MARISHA: Immune to fear, poison, and what else?

02:29:33.257 --> 02:29:35.568
MATT: And you get advantage on wisdom saving
throws.

02:29:35.568 --> 02:29:36.508
SAM: Okay.

02:29:36.508 --> 02:29:41.911
MATT: After which, Percy and Keyleth pretty much
fall asleep at the table as it vanishes and they

02:29:41.911 --> 02:29:47.267
both collapse to the ground, eggs out of the
corner of their mouth. Eventually they make

02:29:47.267 --> 02:29:50.938
themselves back up to sleep and the rest of you
guys peter around for the remainder of the day

02:29:50.938 --> 02:29:56.943
while they get their full rest. It now comes to,
at the end of that eight-hour period of time, I'd

02:29:56.943 --> 02:30:03.055
say about three, four in the afternoon before they
finally wake up. You've restored your spells.

02:30:03.055 --> 02:30:03.918
MARISHA: Yay!

02:30:03.918 --> 02:30:06.895
MATT: And the rest of you are ready to go about
your business.

02:30:06.895 --> 02:30:08.405
LAURA: Let's go, let's go, let's go.

02:30:08.405 --> 02:30:09.892
LIAM: Wait! While they're sleeping, right--

02:30:09.892 --> 02:30:10.974
MATT: Mm-hmm?

02:30:10.974 --> 02:30:12.622
LIAM: I take Scanlan aside.

02:30:12.622 --> 02:30:13.642
MATT: Okay.

02:30:13.642 --> 02:30:14.423
SAM: Oi.

02:30:14.423 --> 02:30:15.466
LIAM: Hey, buddy.

02:30:15.466 --> 02:30:16.495
SAM: Hey, friendo.

02:30:16.495 --> 02:30:17.496
LIAM: Yeah.

02:30:17.496 --> 02:30:19.890
SAM: What's up?

02:30:19.890 --> 02:30:21.025
LIAM: We don't talk a lot.

02:30:21.025 --> 02:30:23.597
SAM: Well, we start to and then you leave the
room, usually.

02:30:23.597 --> 02:30:26.940
(laughter)

02:30:26.940 --> 02:30:31.406
LIAM: I don't handle personal emotional
confrontation very well.

02:30:31.406 --> 02:30:33.182
SAM: It's okay. I walk away.

02:30:33.182 --> 02:30:35.762
(laughter)

02:30:35.762 --> 02:30:36.734
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

02:30:36.734 --> 02:30:38.147
SAM: Then I come back, I feel bad.

02:30:38.147 --> 02:30:39.560
TALIESIN: No, no, that was perfect.

02:30:39.560 --> 02:30:41.397
LIAM: Where did you go?

02:30:41.397 --> 02:30:42.986
SAM: Just kidding, just kidding.

02:30:42.986 --> 02:30:49.295
LIAM: Pull up a chair, sit down, I want to ask you
something.

02:30:49.295 --> 02:30:51.073
SAM: I'm already as low as I can go.

02:30:51.073 --> 02:30:55.910
LIAM: You're right. How do you do it?

02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:57.848
SAM: How do I do what?

02:30:57.848 --> 02:31:02.186
LIAM: How do you do it? You're risking your life
as much as anyone in this group, you're almost

02:31:02.186 --> 02:31:12.095
dying every day. You're fucking smiling all the
time. How do you do it? I'm kind of asking as Liam

02:31:12.095 --> 02:31:19.715
to Sam as well, but mostly as Vax to Scanlan. How
do you do it? You almost died yesterday as well.

02:31:19.715 --> 02:31:25.056
Or two days ago, fuck. Why do you do it?

02:31:25.056 --> 02:31:35.865
SAM: Well, Vax. I don't know, I mean, I like you
people, okay? Everything before this was not as

02:31:35.932 --> 02:31:43.362
good. This is better. That's why. It's very
simple. You had a shitty childhood, didn't you?

02:31:43.362 --> 02:31:45.764
You and the sister?

02:31:45.764 --> 02:31:47.186
LIAM: Yeah.

02:31:47.186 --> 02:31:55.052
SAM: I think Grog had some troubles. We've all had
our share of shit before we all met. Now we're

02:31:55.052 --> 02:32:00.459
together, we're a family, this is better. That's
how I smile. It's better than it was before.

02:32:00.459 --> 02:32:02.744
That's it.

02:32:02.744 --> 02:32:05.132
LIAM: We're probably going to die in the next
month.

02:32:05.132 --> 02:32:07.372
SAM: Yes, but it's fun while it lasts.

02:32:07.372 --> 02:32:16.942
LIAM: All right. Thought I might--

02:32:16.942 --> 02:32:19.369
SAM: Glean some wisdom?

02:32:19.369 --> 02:32:21.738
LIAM: Yeah, but I'm just as confused as before.

02:32:21.738 --> 02:32:25.199
SAM: Listen, I'm older than you.

02:32:25.199 --> 02:32:27.263
LIAM: How much older?

02:32:27.263 --> 02:32:36.324
SAM: A bit. I've seen more than you have. And it's
all shitty, so it just depends on how you look at

02:32:36.324 --> 02:32:44.641
it. You can dwell on the shit, or you can just
leave it behind in people's beds and keep going.

02:32:44.641 --> 02:32:49.288
MARISHA: Oh god, that works on too many levels.

02:32:49.288 --> 02:32:51.095
TALIESIN: Oh god, that's too deep.

02:32:51.095 --> 02:32:52.213
MARISHA: Too deep.

02:32:52.213 --> 02:32:54.518
LIAM: You did that. Water under the bridge.

02:32:54.518 --> 02:32:57.233
SAM: I walk away.

02:32:57.233 --> 02:33:03.825
LIAM: That little motherfucker shit in my bed.

02:33:03.825 --> 02:33:14.570
MATT: All right. As you regather your will, path
chosen; Keyleth, do you wish to prepare the

02:33:14.570 --> 02:33:16.281
transportation spell?

02:33:16.281 --> 02:33:17.465
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:33:17.465 --> 02:33:19.059
TALIESIN: Let's do this.

02:33:19.059 --> 02:33:22.876
MATT: All right. All of you gather and find your
way down to the Sun Tree in the center of the

02:33:22.876 --> 02:33:30.847
town. At this point, it's later afternoon, you've
been growing accustomed these past few days of

02:33:30.847 --> 02:33:39.267
taking action right around dusk, and as the sky
turns from a blue to a bit of an orangish hue, you

02:33:39.267 --> 02:33:47.262
all find yourselves ready to transition back over
to the continent of Issylra.

02:33:47.262 --> 02:33:53.479
MARISHA: Let's go. To the Sun Tree.

02:33:53.479 --> 02:33:58.016
MATT: Keyleth steps forward, touches her hand to
the Sun Tree, completes her mental incantation,

02:33:58.016 --> 02:34:05.331
and you watch the trunk once again tear open into
the somewhat oval walkway into the tree itself. On

02:34:05.331 --> 02:34:07.913
the opposite side, what's your destination?

02:34:07.913 --> 02:34:15.095
MARISHA: Oh, god. As close as I can get to the
Fire Ashari, I guess.

02:34:15.095 --> 02:34:24.237
MATT: Okay. You recall, passing through, there
were a number of trees towards the base of the

02:34:24.237 --> 02:34:30.176
mountain that were starting to grow petrified from
the proximity to the ash that constantly falls

02:34:30.176 --> 02:34:35.261
from the sky. They died a long time ago and are
slowly beginning to petrify. As the portal opens

02:34:35.261 --> 02:34:43.054
up on the opposite side, you can see beyond that
the dark rock that formulates that mountain range.

02:34:43.054 --> 02:34:48.085
At the same time, you can see a dull orange glow,
and you all begin to step through in rapid

02:34:48.085 --> 02:34:54.459
succession, Trinket racing up after Vex. All of
you find yourself stepping out the other side, at

02:34:54.459 --> 02:35:03.320
which point you look up and you can see the
pathway that you took towards the top of the

02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:09.327
mountain where the Fire Ashari called Pyrah, where
they maintained their ever-vigilant watch on the

02:35:09.327 --> 02:35:20.482
tear into the fire elemental plane. What you do
notice immediately is that the path that you took

02:35:20.482 --> 02:35:29.905
initially is no longer a simple walkway. Against
the now very dark sky, this side of the realm

02:35:29.905 --> 02:35:37.279
itself, night is, actually, no, sorry. At this
point, you've actually beaten the sun.

02:35:37.279 --> 02:35:40.144
MARISHA: Oh, do we gain a few hours?

02:35:40.144 --> 02:35:41.473
MATT: Yeah, you guys have gained a few hours,
technically.

02:35:41.473 --> 02:35:42.969
MARISHA: Awesome.

02:35:42.969 --> 02:35:45.620
MATT: So it's still light in the sky from other
parts in the distance, however, there is a

02:35:45.620 --> 02:35:54.163
perpetual dark cloud of smoke and actual storm
cloud gathering across this mountain range. As you

02:35:54.163 --> 02:35:58.430
recall the first time you were here, that's the
nature of Pyrah, it's always under this thick,

02:35:58.430 --> 02:36:03.855
heavy, soot-and-ash-filled cloud cover. The
pathway that winds up the mountain, though, is

02:36:03.855 --> 02:36:12.159
instead a glowing orange mass of slowly dribbling
molten rock that has filled that entire walkway,

02:36:12.159 --> 02:36:17.132
and it has come to rest at the base of the
mountain where it has gathered and begun to cool.

02:36:17.132 --> 02:36:25.271
You guys are hundreds of feet off from this point
as you step out of the tree. However, where you

02:36:25.271 --> 02:36:33.055
see the molten rock has reached the base of the
mountain, you-- it's cooled and formed into solid

02:36:33.055 --> 02:36:39.094
rock at its base, and you start seeing flashes of
the orange turning dark, then another section

02:36:39.094 --> 02:36:45.405
turns dark from the opposite side. And then a few
moments pass and you can see the orange of the

02:36:45.405 --> 02:36:58.526
next section, up in like ten-foot segments, it's
going dark and hardening on its own. You get the

02:36:58.526 --> 02:37:04.853
sense that your arrival did not trigger this more
than it has been happening since

02:37:04.853 --> 02:37:06.522
before you arrived.

02:37:06.522 --> 02:37:09.979
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to figure out
what's up?

02:37:09.979 --> 02:37:15.524
MATT: Sure. Actually, this would be a perception
check to see if you can ascertain.

02:37:15.524 --> 02:37:19.820
MARISHA: 16.

02:37:19.820 --> 02:37:27.471
MATT: 16. It's difficult to make out at this
distance, but you can see, along portions of the

02:37:27.471 --> 02:37:36.257
jagged mountainside, a collection of small figures
that are making their way up the mountain, and

02:37:36.257 --> 02:37:43.500
their slow ascent is met with the lava flow
cooling in sections.

02:37:43.500 --> 02:37:45.918
MARISHA: Do they look like people, like
humanoids?

02:37:45.918 --> 02:37:51.328
MATT: It's hard to tell from this distance, they
look human-ish, humanoid-ish.

02:37:51.328 --> 02:37:54.026
TALIESIN: I attempt to use the optics on my gun to
get a better look at them.

02:37:54.026 --> 02:37:57.468
MATT: Sure, go ahead and make a perception check.

02:37:57.468 --> 02:38:02.505
TALIESIN: 18.

02:38:02.505 --> 02:38:10.308
MATT: 18. A little bit of a clearer look through,
they do appear to be humanoid. You do see two

02:38:10.308 --> 02:38:15.379
arms, two legs. You can't gauge size comparison
from this distance.

02:38:15.379 --> 02:38:17.266
SAM: How far?

02:38:17.266 --> 02:38:22.719
MATT: At this point, they're probably a good 800
feet up the mountain.

02:38:22.719 --> 02:38:25.211
MARISHA: 800 feet?

02:38:25.211 --> 02:38:28.769
TALIESIN: Are they dressed like the Ashari that
I've met?

02:38:28.769 --> 02:38:35.692
MATT: From what you can make out, their color
palette shifts, there are reds and browns, some

02:38:35.692 --> 02:38:45.564
stand out as an aquamarine white. The Ashari you
saw were a pretty consistent color palette. This

02:38:45.564 --> 02:38:47.206
is a little more varied.

02:38:47.206 --> 02:38:48.760
TALIESIN: I don't know who these people are.

02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:54.646
MARISHA: They could still be Ashari. Just in their
elemental forms. Are there any birds around? I

02:38:54.646 --> 02:38:56.349
look up, do I see birds in the sky?

02:38:56.349 --> 02:39:01.772
MATT: There are no birds in the sky.
Unfortunately, because of the nature of this area,

02:39:01.772 --> 02:39:08.830
especially as the oppressive fumes and dust
continue to pour off from the top of the caldera

02:39:08.830 --> 02:39:12.518
of this mountain range, it has made it not fitting
for any sort of aerial life that you're used to

02:39:12.518 --> 02:39:17.669
seeing. You glance around for about a minute or
two and you don't see any sort of bird life in the air.

02:39:17.669 --> 02:39:24.654
TRAVIS: Did the ground cool where they were
walking? Could we follow them up?

02:39:24.654 --> 02:39:26.157
TALIESIN: We should.

02:39:26.157 --> 02:39:32.856
MARISHA: Let's stay far behind. Let's go quietly.

02:39:32.856 --> 02:39:35.326
LAURA: Let's walk. Stealth? I cast Pass Without a
Trace on all of us.

02:39:35.326 --> 02:39:38.747
MATT: Okay. Everyone make a stealth check,
including Trinket.

02:39:38.747 --> 02:39:42.232
TRAVIS: You don't want to put him in the thing?

02:39:42.232 --> 02:39:43.874
SAM: You could.

02:39:43.874 --> 02:39:45.088
LAURA: (gasps) Okay.

02:39:45.088 --> 02:39:46.293
LIAM: Try it out.

02:39:46.293 --> 02:39:48.983
LAURA: I put it on a string so I could put it
around my neck because it's a necklace because

02:39:48.983 --> 02:39:50.389
it's cooler that way.

02:39:50.389 --> 02:39:52.193
MATT: Well, it has a chain on it that it came
with.

02:39:52.193 --> 02:39:53.633
LAURA: It's got a chain on it, so it's around my
neck.

02:39:53.633 --> 02:39:54.970
MATT: All right, so you take it, you put--

02:39:54.970 --> 02:39:56.467
SAM: It has a chain and a string now.

02:39:56.467 --> 02:39:57.945
MATT: Chain and string.

02:39:57.945 --> 02:39:59.974
MARISHA: The string's so you don't forget.

02:39:59.974 --> 02:40:04.289
MATT: Exactly. You trigger the necklace, pointing
it in the direction of Trinket, and once again

02:40:04.289 --> 02:40:09.777
Trinket is absorbed into the crystal, vanishing
within the inside. All right.

02:40:09.777 --> 02:40:12.662
TRAVIS: 17.

02:40:12.662 --> 02:40:14.112
MATT: 17.

02:40:14.112 --> 02:40:16.662
SAM: Pass Without a Trace is--?

02:40:16.662 --> 02:40:19.313
TRAVIS: Plus ten. I rolled shitty.

02:40:19.313 --> 02:40:20.617
LAURA: 30.

02:40:20.617 --> 02:40:21.788
LIAM: 35.

02:40:21.788 --> 02:40:22.880
MARISHA: 32.

02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:23.807
TALIESIN: 29.

02:40:23.807 --> 02:40:25.069
SAM: 25.

02:40:25.069 --> 02:40:33.042
MATT: Okay. You guys begin making your trek up.
How are you going up the mountain? Are you scaling

02:40:33.042 --> 02:40:34.939
the cooled flow?

02:40:34.939 --> 02:40:36.116
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:40:36.116 --> 02:40:40.070
MATT: That's probably the safest route given the
fact that most of the other side of the mountain

02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:46.660
range itself is pretty jagged, and elements of it,
because of the formation of this giant volcanic

02:40:46.660 --> 02:40:51.381
caldera, there are portions of broken stone and
obsidian glass that sticks out the side.

02:40:51.381 --> 02:41:03.279
MARISHA: As we're walking up, I fall behind
and I slip Vax the potion of fire protection.

02:41:03.279 --> 02:41:16.867
MATT: All right. You guys continue in pace with
this, eventually, and make

02:41:16.867 --> 02:41:19.765
another perception check?

02:41:19.765 --> 02:41:25.932
MARISHA: Much better, that's a natural 19. 30.

02:41:25.932 --> 02:41:32.966
MATT: 30. Okay. Looking up, as this cluster of
individuals makes their way towards the very top

02:41:32.966 --> 02:41:40.471
of the mountain, seemingly not taking sight of
your traveling group, you're beginning to see the

02:41:40.471 --> 02:41:46.273
nature of each section of this flow cooling. And
what you're seeing is the group will move up a

02:41:46.273 --> 02:41:56.253
bit, stop, and there appears to be a burst of--
sometimes it looks like very strong wind, sometimes

02:41:56.253 --> 02:42:03.808
it looks like a very localized sleet storm that is
brought against the side of the mountain and is

02:42:03.808 --> 02:42:09.219
actually forcefully cooling the flow down
temporarily, at least in those sections, before it

02:42:09.219 --> 02:42:13.890
begins to spill over and continue its slow molten
descent, but they're doing their best to continue

02:42:13.890 --> 02:42:16.504
to force it back up the mountain and--

02:42:16.504 --> 02:42:18.623
LAURA and MARISHA: Those are druids.

02:42:18.623 --> 02:42:24.389
MARISHA: I cast Skywrite in the clouds above us,
in the smoke.

02:42:24.389 --> 02:42:25.706
MATT: Okay.

02:42:25.706 --> 02:42:28.510
MARISHA: And I write--

02:42:28.510 --> 02:42:31.801
LAURA: "So, how are you guys doing up there?"

02:42:31.801 --> 02:42:33.512
TALIESIN: "Hi."

02:42:33.512 --> 02:42:45.107
MARISHA: "Hi. Hey you guys." I write, in druidic
symbols, "Keyleth, Kaitiaki."

02:42:45.107 --> 02:42:49.769
SAM: What's that? Is that her?

02:42:49.769 --> 02:43:01.120
MATT: Okay. You notice the pace in which this
group has ascended comes to a halt at the very,

02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:08.191
very top of the mountain range where it ends, and
there's a slight pause before the clouds shift a

02:43:08.191 --> 02:43:19.762
second time and it says, from what you understand,
"Kaitiaki. Survivors remain, Keyleth."

02:43:19.762 --> 02:43:26.004
MARISHA: And I respond with, "Help has arrived."

02:43:26.004 --> 02:43:29.006
SAM: You guys are texting?

02:43:29.006 --> 02:43:30.251
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

02:43:30.251 --> 02:43:32.016
MATT: Druid texting.

02:43:32.016 --> 02:43:34.412
LAURA: What are you saying?

02:43:34.412 --> 02:43:35.914
TALIESIN: Stop looking at your phone.

02:43:35.914 --> 02:43:37.632
LAURA: What do they say?

02:43:37.632 --> 02:43:39.286
SAM: Why don't we go over there and talk to them?

02:43:39.286 --> 02:43:40.535
MARISHA: They're survivors.

02:43:40.535 --> 02:43:41.954
TRAVIS: Well, let's go.

02:43:41.954 --> 02:43:43.271
LAURA: Are they nice?

02:43:43.271 --> 02:43:46.574
MARISHA: They're survivors. What does it matter?

02:43:46.574 --> 02:43:48.925
TRAVIS: And we go.

02:43:48.925 --> 02:43:56.623
MARISHA: Let's go. And I tell them, you know,
"Arriving. Stand down. Here we come."

02:43:56.623 --> 02:43:57.724
TALIESIN: "Lol."

02:43:57.724 --> 02:43:59.453
MARISHA: "Lol. Winky-face."

02:43:59.453 --> 02:44:06.492
LIAM: As we travel, because I was too out of it to
respond and she's way ahead, I take the potion

02:44:06.492 --> 02:44:10.001
that Keyleth gave to me, because she didn't have
to, I've got the David Bowie armor on now.

02:44:10.001 --> 02:44:11.810
MATT: You did don it. Okay.

02:44:11.810 --> 02:44:13.414
LIAM: Yes, yeah. Before going to bed.

02:44:13.414 --> 02:44:14.434
MARISHA: Oh you did, okay.

02:44:14.434 --> 02:44:16.832
LIAM: And I press it into Vex's hand.

02:44:16.832 --> 02:44:19.404
MATT: Okay.

02:44:19.404 --> 02:44:23.958
LAURA: Hey, I took your, all right, I'm going to
take it.

02:44:23.958 --> 02:44:29.436
MATT: What was your choice of resistance? I assume
it was fire. Okay. All right. As you guys progress

02:44:29.436 --> 02:44:35.067
up, and it is, though it is a safe route, it is
still a relatively steep incline and you're all

02:44:35.067 --> 02:44:40.124
having to work together to find handholds, and it
is very arduous physically getting up there. I

02:44:40.124 --> 02:44:44.657
would like everyone to go ahead and make a constitution
saving throw.

02:44:44.657 --> 02:44:45.942
SAM: Oh, shit.

02:44:45.942 --> 02:44:47.425
LAURA: A constitution?

02:44:47.425 --> 02:44:48.400
MATT: Yes.

02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:50.279
LAURA: Oh, do we get advantage because of the
feast?

02:44:50.279 --> 02:44:51.468
TRAVIS: No, that's only wisdom.

02:44:51.468 --> 02:44:52.486
LAURA: Shit.

02:44:52.486 --> 02:44:54.515
LIAM: Come on, Colville meteorite die.

02:44:54.515 --> 02:44:55.633
TRAVIS: 17.

02:44:55.633 --> 02:44:56.666
LIAM: I'm so weak.

02:44:56.666 --> 02:44:57.884
LAURA: Come on, jade.

02:44:57.884 --> 02:44:59.225
LIAM: Natural 20!

02:44:59.225 --> 02:45:00.275
LAURA: You motherfucker!

02:45:00.275 --> 02:45:01.428
LIAM: Thank you, Matthew Colville.

02:45:01.428 --> 02:45:03.140
LAURA: I'm rolling my giant jade dice, because
it's green.

02:45:03.140 --> 02:45:05.277
TRAVIS: Way to announce it.

02:45:05.277 --> 02:45:12.438
LAURA: Womp-womp. Oh, that's a six.

02:45:12.438 --> 02:45:14.267
TRAVIS: (laughs) You're fucked.

02:45:14.267 --> 02:45:15.496
MARISHA: 20.

02:45:15.496 --> 02:45:16.534
TALIESIN: 13.

02:45:16.534 --> 02:45:17.576
SAM: Five.

02:45:17.576 --> 02:45:23.469
MATT: Okay. As you guys begin to get partially up
the mountain, the proximity of the heat from the--

02:45:23.469 --> 02:45:26.446
because the exterior of the rock has cooled, but
it's still molten beneath and there are

02:45:26.446 --> 02:45:31.253
parts of that are still cracking open, and bits of
the heat are still pouring through, plus the

02:45:31.302 --> 02:45:37.036
general physical exertion from the not-very-hardy
physiques of both Vex and Scanlan, you both suffer

02:45:37.036 --> 02:45:40.793
one level of exhaustion from the ascent up the
side of this mountain.

02:45:40.793 --> 02:45:43.537
LAURA: Oh, Trinket's in his thing, he's not
worried at all.

02:45:43.537 --> 02:45:46.630
TALIESIN: I don't actually know what one level of
exhaustion is.

02:45:46.630 --> 02:45:50.666
MATT: You guys have disadvantage on ability
checks. All your skill checks right now, until

02:45:50.666 --> 02:45:52.607
your next long rest, are at disadvantage.

02:45:52.607 --> 02:45:54.300
TRAVIS: Levels of exhaustion suck.

02:45:54.300 --> 02:45:56.691
SAM: Not saving.

02:45:56.691 --> 02:46:03.176
MATT: However, as you guys are approaching towards
the top, you can see now the humanoids that were at

02:46:03.176 --> 02:46:07.995
the top of this mountain crest have been since
keeping the flow at bay and each time it begins to

02:46:07.995 --> 02:46:12.223
crest over again and continue its flow, it's
blasted again from the side and cools and it's

02:46:12.223 --> 02:46:15.461
building this very, very slow gradual
outcropping--

02:46:15.461 --> 02:46:22.376
MARISHA: I use my cantrip Gust and cool areas
alongside as we ascend.

02:46:22.376 --> 02:46:26.406
MATT: Okay. You glance up and you now have a
better view of this group, and what you do see

02:46:26.406 --> 02:46:34.189
ahead of you, specifically Keyleth, appears to be
a cluster of about eight or so Fire Ashari-dressed

02:46:34.189 --> 02:46:42.152
individuals. You can't make out their physical
details yet. Along with five other entities that

02:46:42.152 --> 02:46:47.258
are dressed in the colors and vestments of those
from Zephrah.

02:46:47.258 --> 02:46:50.433
MARISHA: Oh shit!

02:46:50.433 --> 02:46:52.060
TRAVIS: From who? From what?

02:46:52.060 --> 02:46:53.656
LIAM: What's the matter?

02:46:53.656 --> 02:46:55.268
LAURA: What's up? What's happening?

02:46:55.268 --> 02:46:58.509
MARISHA: I run up.

02:46:58.509 --> 02:47:01.020
MATT: Keyleth goes running up.

02:47:01.020 --> 02:47:04.570
MARISHA: You said seven or eight from 
Zephrah?

02:47:04.570 --> 02:47:08.105
MATT: There are five from Zephrah.

02:47:08.105 --> 02:47:11.012
LAURA: Are we going to, we're going to follow?

02:47:11.012 --> 02:47:13.001
LIAM: Yeah, I'm breaking out of stealth and
running.

02:47:13.001 --> 02:47:16.564
TALIESIN: Ah. Yeah. No. We're running now.

02:47:16.564 --> 02:47:22.190
LAURA: I walk. I'm pretty tired. You and me. Let's
just walk.

02:47:22.190 --> 02:47:24.430
SAM: Yeah. You can carry me.

02:47:24.430 --> 02:47:25.893
TALIESIN: Cardio. God.

02:47:25.893 --> 02:47:29.647
MATT: Okay, it takes a while to get up there. As
you guys begin to approach, a little bit behind

02:47:29.647 --> 02:47:39.511
Keyleth, and you look, you see the only two
notable Fire Ashari that you see there are

02:47:39.511 --> 02:47:46.472
Nastoen, which is a human female that you saw was
one of the four that first greeted you as you

02:47:46.472 --> 02:47:51.397
approached Pyrah when you got to the mountaintop.
She looks a little rough, but she's definitely in

02:47:51.397 --> 02:47:57.907
one piece. The other one that greets you, and
immediately you recognize as Flamespeaker

02:47:57.907 --> 02:48:10.511
Cerkonos, who currently does not have his right
arm. It is charred and is, through some semblance

02:48:10.511 --> 02:48:16.940
of flame, cauterized to where he no longer has a
shoulder and part of his torso is a black mass of

02:48:16.940 --> 02:48:22.921
burnt skin, probably intentionally, but as you
approach he puts his hand out and goes,

02:48:22.921 --> 02:48:25.385
"Hail, Keyleth."

02:48:25.385 --> 02:48:30.060
MARISHA: Hail, Cerkonos. And I run up and give him
a hug.

02:48:30.060 --> 02:48:38.012
MATT: He pats you on the back and there's a
coldness to his look, his expression. You can see

02:48:38.012 --> 02:48:43.415
in a brief instant, though there is strength and
determination, there is a moment as he looks into

02:48:43.415 --> 02:48:46.182
your face that you can see the sorrow of losing
most of his people.

02:48:46.182 --> 02:48:50.812
MARISHA: And I look back at him and I say: I'm so
sorry.

02:48:50.812 --> 02:49:05.098
MATT: "This is not your fault. We had this coming.
We are the able-bodied few you see."

02:49:05.098 --> 02:49:09.493
MARISHA: Are these all that have survived?

02:49:09.493 --> 02:49:20.558
MATT: "We are 25 living. The rest reside at the
base of the mountain, to be watched, or are the

02:49:20.558 --> 02:49:31.167
"watchers. But our attrition is of our own making.
We helped outsiders too long ago."

02:49:31.167 --> 02:49:39.835
MARISHA: What? What do you mean, like, how long
ago? 12, 15 years?

02:49:39.835 --> 02:49:43.050
MATT: "We helped seal a drake in this rift."

02:49:43.050 --> 02:49:45.974
LAURA: Thordak.

02:49:45.974 --> 02:49:54.990
MATT: "That is the name they call him. We helped
bring and bind the beast to this rift, sealing

02:49:54.990 --> 02:50:05.801
"within it the heart of a primordial flame, one of
the few pure essence crystals of our plane. Such a

02:50:05.801 --> 02:50:12.438
"binding will not allow it to leave. It is a
punishment for the most terrible of evils that the

02:50:12.438 --> 02:50:22.556
"Ashari take under their order. We carved from the
crystal in bind. This beast was too strong and

02:50:22.556 --> 02:50:30.588
"took the entire crystal, but it seemed enough. It
seemed enough."

02:50:30.588 --> 02:50:41.762
MARISHA: Cerkonos, it's not your fault. There are
greater forces at work here, beyond us. That's

02:50:41.762 --> 02:50:47.504
something that I am desperately trying to reassure
myself of every day.

02:50:47.504 --> 02:50:59.210
MATT: And a voice comes up from over the mountain
range, raspy, older, and with a casual importance

02:50:59.210 --> 02:51:10.387
to it, and it says, "So, are you claiming some
semblance of dealing with this?" And as it steps

02:51:10.387 --> 02:51:19.809
over, the face looks down with recognition. "My
god. Keyleth."

02:51:19.809 --> 02:51:22.714
MARISHA: Who are you?

02:51:22.714 --> 02:51:31.206
MATT: You guys look up and you see long,
silver-haired half-elf in later years dressed in

02:51:31.254 --> 02:51:46.251
the blue and white robes of the Air Ashari. You
see before you Korren, your father. "You live."

02:51:46.251 --> 02:51:48.921
MARISHA: Dad!

02:51:48.921 --> 02:51:54.966
MATT: He steps forward and goes in, as he steps
away from Cerkonos, takes you in his arms and

02:51:54.966 --> 02:51:58.769
holds you extremely tight against him.

02:51:58.769 --> 02:52:07.501
MARISHA: I'm sorry I didn't check in sooner. I
didn't want you to be disappointed.

02:52:07.501 --> 02:52:11.839
MATT: "Shh." He puts his finger up to your lips,
holds you back and looks you over and with a smile

02:52:11.839 --> 02:52:19.481
on his face, you can see the hardness of his
expression fade. "Keyleth, you've grown."

02:52:19.481 --> 02:52:23.473
MARISHA: A lot's happened.

02:52:23.473 --> 02:52:29.521
MATT: "You look just like her."

02:52:29.521 --> 02:52:32.666
MARISHA: I haven't found Mom.

02:52:32.666 --> 02:52:42.329
MATT: "Her path was her own. I'm just glad that
you have maintained yours." He wipes the tear from

02:52:42.329 --> 02:52:44.699
your face and says, "How goes the Aramente?"

02:52:44.699 --> 02:52:47.370
MARISHA: Well.

02:52:47.370 --> 02:52:50.141
LAURA: She's kicking ass.

02:52:50.141 --> 02:53:03.829
MATT: "Good. Good." And he places his thumb at the
corner of his eye. "We were called naught but a

02:53:03.829 --> 02:53:10.314
"day ago by the surviving Pyrah. Told of the angry
mountain and the terrible drake that sundered the

02:53:10.314 --> 02:53:17.100
"rift. I helmed the team while the majority of our
people stayed to keep Zephrah cloaked and safe

02:53:17.100 --> 02:53:24.695
"from the marauding beast. We've only just made our
way up the mountain. Your arrival is quite

02:53:24.695 --> 02:53:28.428
"fortuitous, as we need all the help we can get."

02:53:28.428 --> 02:53:30.991
SAM: How can we be of assistance?

02:53:30.991 --> 02:53:40.986
MATT: "Come. See what remains of Pyrah." He turns
around and walks back over towards the top of the

02:53:40.986 --> 02:53:42.007
mountain.

02:53:42.007 --> 02:53:43.310
MARISHA: Daddy.

02:53:43.310 --> 02:53:46.576
MATT: He stops. Looks over his shoulder towards
you. "Yes?"

02:53:46.576 --> 02:53:51.394
MARISHA: It's good to see you again, father.

02:53:51.394 --> 02:54:02.435
MATT: "It's good to see you as well, daughter. Now
come. Show me what you've learned." Goes back to

02:54:02.435 --> 02:54:10.073
walking. The rest of the Fire Ashari stand up,
acknowledge and recognize those of you that stand

02:54:10.073 --> 02:54:18.864
here before, visiting once before. Cerkonos looks
about. "You show strength and honor by coming here

02:54:18.864 --> 02:54:28.458
"in our time of need. This will not be forgotten.
Now come." As you follow them up over the top of

02:54:28.458 --> 02:54:32.619
the mountain, you see once again before you the
caldera of this once-volcanic mountain has been

02:54:32.619 --> 02:54:39.732
blown apart in areas. You can see sections of
large black stone that are now pushed up into

02:54:39.732 --> 02:54:48.424
jagged obelisks where once was a relatively smooth
blackened shale countryside. You can see there are

02:54:48.424 --> 02:54:55.481
pits of molten rock that have been punched through
the floor and have gathered into these pools where

02:54:55.481 --> 02:55:02.522
the air above is slowly shifting and warped by the
heat that is now released above the mountaintop.

02:55:02.522 --> 02:55:08.524
The flow of lava that descends down the side of
this mountain continues and swells and heads

02:55:08.524 --> 02:55:13.832
inward towards the Cindergrove. The Cindergrove,
from what you can see from this distance, is but a

02:55:13.832 --> 02:55:20.605
fraction of what was once there, most of the trees
now torn apart and scattered amongst the top of

02:55:20.605 --> 02:55:27.013
this mountain. You can see bits and pieces of the
various petrified trees thrown hundreds of feet

02:55:27.013 --> 02:55:33.010
from the center. There are still standing, defiant
trees amongst what once was the Cindergrove, but

02:55:33.010 --> 02:55:38.636
they are very sparse, many of them now blackened
by what you can see in the very distance beyond

02:55:38.636 --> 02:55:47.325
the broken huts and homes that once held the
Pyrah, you can see in the distance moving, glowing

02:55:47.325 --> 02:55:56.520
dots of various elemental energies spiraling
outward from a very large central red rift that

02:55:56.520 --> 02:56:03.873
sits there pulsing and pulsing with bright, almost
sunlight energy. It's like staring into the sun at

02:56:03.873 --> 02:56:08.920
the very zenith of its movement. You have to avert
your eyes even staring towards this rift, now a

02:56:08.920 --> 02:56:14.469
good 30, 40 feet taller than it was when you last
returned here. What was once the portal in the

02:56:14.469 --> 02:56:19.136
ground has now ruptured and is emerging, slowly
piercing out of the top of this mountain.

02:56:19.136 --> 02:56:27.092
Undaunted, your father and the other Ashari
continue walking forward with no words.

02:56:27.092 --> 02:56:44.491
LAURA: I rush forward a little bit to talk to him.
Question. Your majesty? I want to help, we all

02:56:44.491 --> 02:56:51.638
want to help as much as possible, but I don't know
any magic. Most of us don't. Are we going to be

02:56:51.638 --> 02:56:53.478
able to do anything?

02:56:53.478 --> 02:57:00.031
MATT: "Well, I certainly hope so. If you've
survived this long with my daughter, you've picked

02:57:00.031 --> 02:57:01.545
"up a few tricks."

02:57:01.545 --> 02:57:03.186
LAURA: Well, that I have.

02:57:03.186 --> 02:57:11.420
MARISHA: Father, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't
for these people. They are the most capable

02:57:11.420 --> 02:57:12.962
that I know.

02:57:12.962 --> 02:57:16.505
MATT: "This is good. Because that's who we need
right now."

02:57:16.505 --> 02:57:29.785
MARISHA: However, since we're druids, we're a
little bit more, you know. Geared. Prepared to

02:57:29.785 --> 02:57:37.368
deal with the fire. I can cast Protection from
Energy on a couple of these people, if you

02:57:37.368 --> 02:57:40.907
wouldn't mind maybe grabbing the other two?

02:57:40.907 --> 02:57:44.190
MATT: "I will do what I can."

02:57:44.190 --> 02:57:53.503
MARISHA: And I cast Protection from Fire on Percy,
you have it, you have it, do you have it?

02:57:53.503 --> 02:57:56.579
TRAVIS: Well, I really don't even know what I'm
going to do here.

02:57:56.579 --> 02:57:58.737
MARISHA: Well, it's going to protect you from
fire.

02:57:58.737 --> 02:58:01.070
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:02.546
MARISHA: Scanlan?

02:58:02.546 --> 02:58:03.984
SAM: Hit me, babe.

02:58:03.984 --> 02:58:09.183
MARISHA: I'll do Percy and Scanlan. Father, can
you--?

02:58:09.183 --> 02:58:12.819
MATT: It's a concentration spell, so you can only
really have one person going, and that's your

02:58:12.819 --> 02:58:13.951
concentration.

02:58:13.951 --> 02:58:15.532
MARISHA: Can only have one person going.

02:58:15.532 --> 02:58:16.422
MATT: Yep.

02:58:16.422 --> 02:58:17.289
TRAVIS: Well, good.

02:58:17.289 --> 02:58:19.882
MARISHA: I could cast it at higher levels. Can I
cast it at higher levels?

02:58:19.882 --> 02:58:21.022
TRAVIS: I'll take a mulligan on this one.

02:58:21.022 --> 02:58:22.489
MARISHA: Can't do that with this one? Fuck.

02:58:22.489 --> 02:58:24.118
LAURA: Do Scanlan. Do Scanlan.

02:58:24.118 --> 02:58:25.508
SAM: No, I'm fine, don't worry about me.

02:58:25.508 --> 02:58:31.379
MARISHA: Well, I'm going to cast it on myself, for
starters. Because I want it.

02:58:31.379 --> 02:58:32.399
LAURA: All right.

02:58:32.399 --> 02:58:36.972
MARISHA: So I'm going to cast Protection from Fire
on myself.

02:58:36.972 --> 02:58:39.165
LAURA: What does a potion of fire resistance do?

02:58:39.165 --> 02:58:40.180
LIAM: Halves.

02:58:40.180 --> 02:58:41.195
LAURA: The same thing?

02:58:41.195 --> 02:58:42.722
LAURA and MARISHA: Halves all fire damage?

02:58:42.722 --> 02:58:43.829
LAURA: Okay.

02:58:43.829 --> 02:58:51.792
MATT: All right. As the cluster of you begin
stepping deeper into the caldera, you begin to

02:58:51.792 --> 02:58:59.954
approach the outskirts of the remnants of the
Pyrah tribe's homestead. You can see where most of

02:58:59.954 --> 02:59:07.182
it has been either completely burnt to a cinder or
lies tattered by some great force, shattered. And

02:59:07.182 --> 02:59:12.002
you start, as you're walking through, you can see
where the landscape itself, all the jagged bits of

02:59:12.002 --> 02:59:17.267
black obsidian glass are shooting up out of the
ground and there's broken pieces of the dark rock

02:59:17.267 --> 02:59:22.001
and volcanic material, and it isn't until your
eyes begin to focus that you realize that elements

02:59:22.001 --> 02:59:27.901
of this rock is not rock at all but the twisted
and charred remains of the Pyrah that didn't

02:59:27.901 --> 02:59:35.958
escape in time, blending in with the ground and
landscape surrounding. The rest of the Ashari

02:59:35.958 --> 02:59:41.673
continue pushing forward, not taking notice,
focused, as before you, you can see the rift,

02:59:41.673 --> 02:59:47.939
still blinking ever-bright, in the center of the
remains of the Cindergrove. You steel yourselves.

02:59:47.939 --> 02:59:57.786
MARISHA: I turn and I look at them and nod and
follow in my people's footsteps.

02:59:57.786 --> 03:00:00.995
MATT: And that's where we'll end tonight's
session.

03:00:00.995 --> 03:00:02.582
TRAVIS and LAURA: Oh shit.

03:00:02.582 --> 03:00:06.778
TRAVIS: Okay. We're cooking with gas now.

03:00:06.778 --> 03:00:08.750
LAURA: As Marisha collapses in a pool of tears.

03:00:08.750 --> 03:00:11.177
TALIESIN: Cry more, cry more!

03:00:11.177 --> 03:00:13.454
MATT: You knew this was coming.

03:00:13.454 --> 03:00:20.421
LAURA: Yeah, man. You're going to have a headache
tomorrow, dude.

03:00:20.421 --> 03:00:23.060
MARISHA: I'm so tired. I'm tired.

03:00:23.060 --> 03:00:27.260
LAURA: Aw, we've got exhaustion, Sam. That's
balls.

03:00:27.260 --> 03:00:29.283
SAM: Yeah, that's not great.

03:00:29.283 --> 03:00:32.785
LIAM: Thanks for tuning in to Therapy Thursday,
everyone.

03:00:32.785 --> 03:00:36.507
TRAVIS: Where we take shits and talk to swords.

03:00:36.507 --> 03:00:38.509
LAURA: There you go.

03:00:38.509 --> 03:00:41.235
MATT: Got a little bit of column A, little bit of
column B, we got some drama, we got some personal

03:00:41.235 --> 03:00:48.189
issues, we got some reunions, we got some
hardships, we got--

03:00:48.189 --> 03:00:49.292
TALIESIN: Wild animals.

03:00:49.292 --> 03:00:51.315
LAURA: Yeah, so many things!

03:00:51.315 --> 03:00:54.809
MATT: And a travel method for Trinket.

03:00:54.809 --> 03:00:57.225
LAURA: Oh my god, I'm so excited about it!

03:00:57.225 --> 03:00:59.954
MATT: I wasn't sure how you guys were going to use
that one, as soon as you mentioned it I was like,

03:00:59.954 --> 03:01:06.950
all right, that's what they're doing. That's a way
to do it. Yeah. Well cool, guys, we'll be back

03:01:06.950 --> 03:01:13.117
next week Thursday with Chris Hardwick, who will be
joining us as a guest.

03:01:13.117 --> 03:01:14.203
LAURA: Yay!

03:01:14.203 --> 03:01:16.134
MARISHA: How is he going to be here?

03:01:16.134 --> 03:01:19.133
TALIESIN: As himself. He's going to be playing
himself, it's going to be very exciting.

03:01:19.133 --> 03:01:21.527
TRAVIS: Guys, I'm a human. Usually.

03:01:21.527 --> 03:01:24.391
LIAM: I'm super busy, I'm super busy.

03:01:24.391 --> 03:01:27.036
TALIESIN: Out of the rift suddenly comes Chris
Hardwick.

03:01:27.036 --> 03:01:28.998
MARISHA: Super busy, but I'm super successful.

03:01:28.998 --> 03:01:31.107
LIAM: I'll help save the world, but I got like 50
things on my schedule.

03:01:31.107 --> 03:01:40.879
MATT: Yeah, so we'll be back then. I think April
21st is going to be our 50th episode. We're

03:01:40.879 --> 03:01:52.036
going to be doing a fun little evening there.
We'll have Critmas coming up, probably end up

03:01:52.036 --> 03:01:55.876
being that night, maybe another night that week, we'll
have details coming up soon, we're trying to

03:01:55.876 --> 03:01:59.721
figure out the schedule on that. This'll be our
big 50th anniversary Critmas blowout, and then

03:01:59.721 --> 03:02:03.863
we're going to scale it back to like an
annual-type event it looks like, both to save the

03:02:03.863 --> 03:02:10.724
people who work this channel Thursday nights and
stay super later to get here, to save the length

03:02:10.724 --> 03:02:14.722
of the episodes, and to help all of us who have to
then go to work sometimes very early

03:02:14.722 --> 03:02:16.043
the next morning.

03:02:16.043 --> 03:02:20.522
LIAM: We love you, but I need to sleep. It's as
simple as that. We love you, and we love Critmas,

03:02:20.522 --> 03:02:23.180
but it's a health thing.

03:02:23.180 --> 03:02:27.494
MATT: So what we'll be doing is this will be our
big blowout Critmas, we'll still do it probably

03:02:27.494 --> 03:02:32.410
for the holidays, and we really implore you guys
to give to charities, send us stuff, we still read

03:02:32.410 --> 03:02:35.983
them, we'll still do Periscopes, those
of us who get gifts, some of us will open them on

03:02:35.983 --> 03:02:39.580
Periscope for you, so we'll still have the
interaction, we'll have to do it on our own time

03:02:39.580 --> 03:02:42.432
and not at 11, midnight.

03:02:42.432 --> 03:02:43.724
TRAVIS: 12, 12:30.

03:02:43.724 --> 03:02:44.969
LIAM: 12:37.

03:02:44.969 --> 03:02:46.304
TALIESIN: On a 7AM call.

03:02:46.304 --> 03:02:50.577
MATT: So this'll be our big general blowout. So if
you're planning something for the next Critmas,

03:02:50.577 --> 03:02:54.868
this'll be the one to get it in for. But yeah, you
can check out the guide to Critmas on Geek &amp;amp;

03:02:54.868 --> 03:02:58.242
Sundry, it has a list of all our supported
charities if you want to give there. It's highly

03:02:58.242 --> 03:03:03.575
recommended. Thank you guys so much for those who
