00:00:00.536 --> 00:00:04.141
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to Critical
Role, the show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice

00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:09.626
actors get together, roll dice, and play Dungeons
and Dragons. My name is Matthew Mercer, I'm the

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:14.140
Dungeon Master of the game. Welcome, new folks who
haven't seen this before, hope you're not too

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.784
lost, and returning Team Hooman and Critter fans,
welcome back, we love having you and let's get

00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:22.324
this evening on the road. We have some
announcements and things to talk about before the

00:00:22.324 --> 00:00:27.315
game actually kicks in, so we'll first pass it
over here to our fantastic overlord

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:28.386
to get that kicked off.

00:00:28.386 --> 00:00:31.045
ZAC: That's right, you get to see my ugly face for
a couple minutes while I get through a couple

00:00:31.045 --> 00:00:35.785
quick announcements, guys. A lot of you have been
asking me on Twitter and in the chat room when you

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:42.316
will get to see Critical Troll? That will be up on
the website tomorrow night at 8PM Pacific Standard

00:00:42.316 --> 00:00:47.208
Time. So go over to the website at 8PM, you'll be
able to see that and I'm sure you guys will

00:00:47.208 --> 00:00:50.626
secretly pass around the youtube link and stuff.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.474
MATT: Watch me go crazy.

00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:55.791
ZAC: Currently you can find Laura's article on
GeekandSundry.com.

00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:56.788
LAURA: What?!

00:00:56.788 --> 00:01:00.611
ZAC: That came out today, so make sure to head
over to the website and read that. And I know a

00:01:00.611 --> 00:01:06.753
lot of you are probably wondering about D&amp;amp;Diesel.
Which is apparently the name, D&amp;amp;Diesel.

00:01:06.753 --> 00:01:07.644
LAURA: Yeah, it is.

00:01:07.644 --> 00:01:08.479
ZAC: Got a ring to it.

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:09.472
TALIESIN: Hashtag D&amp;amp;Diesel.

00:01:09.472 --> 00:01:14.063
ZAC: Hashtag D&amp;amp;Diesel. That will be showing
tonight during the midpoint of the show. Now,

00:01:14.063 --> 00:01:18.908
there's a couple special things with this showing,
you need to watch it live. If you think that

00:01:18.908 --> 00:01:22.821
you're going to come back later, watch it on the
rebroadcast, and you're gonna go dip out for a pee

00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:28.615
break or pizza break, whatever, don't! Stick around
because after it shows tonight live, you will

00:01:28.615 --> 00:01:33.091
be unable to see it again until Monday on the
website. So it will be cut from the rebroadcasts.

00:01:33.303 --> 00:01:34.225
LAURA: Whoa.

00:01:34.225 --> 00:01:38.352
ZAC: And I'm very sorry to our European audience.
I'm really sorry about that, but that's just

00:01:38.352 --> 00:01:44.293
unfortunately how PR deals work sometimes and
that's just the way it is. But, it'll only be--

00:01:44.293 --> 00:01:45.343
MATT: It's only a few days!

00:01:45.343 --> 00:01:48.775
ZAC: Yeah, it'll only be a few days and you'll get
to see a lot more on Monday. A longer cut and

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.976
that's why it's a website exclusive. It's longer,
it'll have some tightening and all sorts of other

00:01:51.976 --> 00:01:56.496
stuff. But, you guys get a special treat tonight
with a preview showing, and it's still a long

00:01:56.496 --> 00:01:59.093
preview, it's like 20-25 minutes or something like
that.

00:01:59.093 --> 00:02:00.143
LAURA: Whoa, it is?

00:02:00.143 --> 00:02:00.934
MATT: Yeah.

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:01.710
ZAC: It's pretty cool.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.378
MATT: That'll be exciting.

00:02:03.378 --> 00:02:09.307
ZAC: So there's that. Tomorrow we have a very
special event happening for all of those that

00:02:09.307 --> 00:02:13.851
joined us for the Extra Life campaign, thank you
so much, and a lot of you guys were here as well.

00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:15.366
MATT: Yes indeed.

00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:19.436
ZAC: And thank you for donating, getting us well
past our goal, and as some of you may remember

00:02:19.436 --> 00:02:24.170
during Critical Troll, Felicia mentioned that if
we reached a certain goal, she would come on, on a

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.044
scheduled date and play Rock Band 4. So that's
happening, tomorrow.

00:02:29.044 --> 00:02:29.940
MATT: Yup!

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.380
ZAC: We are having a battle of the bands from 5 to
7PM Pacific Standard Time, and Mr. Mercer here is

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.431
going to be playing the drums.

00:02:36.431 --> 00:02:43.978
MATT: Yeah, I'm drumming for them, which, first
off, I haven't played since probably 2011,

00:02:43.978 --> 00:02:47.364
and I'm a little rusty.

00:02:47.364 --> 00:02:49.567
ZAC: Have you seen your competition?

00:02:49.567 --> 00:02:52.127
MATT: No, but I assume they're gonna destroy me.

00:02:52.127 --> 00:02:53.329
ZAC: They're really good.

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:54.929
MATT: That's okay. I will narrate my failure.

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:55.847
ZAC: There we go!

00:02:55.847 --> 00:02:57.427
MATT: In a way that will still be as engrossing.
(laughs)

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:00.201
ZAC: And there's been a Twitter battle happening
between the two teams.

00:03:00.201 --> 00:03:01.295
MATT: Oh really?

00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:05.807
ZAC: You're kinda walking into the fire, my
friend.

00:03:05.807 --> 00:03:06.923
MATT: That's okay.

00:03:06.923 --> 00:03:08.692
ZAC: Felicia's put a lot on the line for you guy's
team.

00:03:08.692 --> 00:03:10.391
MATT: That's cool. I got fire resistance. That's
fine.

00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:14.058
ZAC: Okay cool, cool. That'll be happening
tomorrow 5PM to 7PM Pacific Standard Time, you

00:03:14.058 --> 00:03:17.351
guys should tune in for that. We are still going to
be donating to Extra Life, but we're not really

00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:21.986
going to be pushing it, it's more of a reward for
you guys for helping us get past that $75k goal.

00:03:21.986 --> 00:03:23.426
MATT: Yes.

00:03:23.426 --> 00:03:27.734
ZAC: Our next giveaway is going to be at 9,500,
we're getting pretty close. The other real quick

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.787
little announcement I have as far as subs go, is
last week you guys were able to get our sub train

00:03:32.787 --> 00:03:39.809
up to 420 subs, now that counts resubs and new
subs. So we have the sub train going right now, I

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:41.830
believe it's well over a hundred--

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.753
MATT: Woof.

00:03:42.753 --> 00:03:46.541
ZAC: If we break last week's record of 420 which I
think they purposely stopped at 420--

00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:47.938
MATT: (laughs) Of course they did.

00:03:47.938 --> 00:03:54.103
ZAC: Hey guys, don't go. We will do a giant
giveaway of board games, D&amp;amp;D stuff signed by the

00:03:54.103 --> 00:03:59.025
cast, signed by the rest of the Twitch crew. We'll
throw in a couple video games, t-shirts, all sorts

00:03:59.025 --> 00:04:04.647
of stuff. Plus Ivan has said if we reach that goal
for TPK, which those that watched last Monday,

00:04:04.647 --> 00:04:05.702
thank you so much.

00:04:05.702 --> 00:04:06.642
MATT: Yeah!

00:04:06.642 --> 00:04:11.100
ZAC: It's a new show on Monday nights where our
Twitch cast plays as themself in Outbreak Undead.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:18.652
Last week, some of you saw the Twitch cast leave
me for dead outside of the studio. And a lot of

00:04:18.652 --> 00:04:23.558
people thought that I might come back if given the
opportunity. Well, if we break that sub goal, Ivan

00:04:23.558 --> 00:04:27.893
has said that I will come back and probably wreak
havoc in some way for our Twitch host that thought

00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:31.305
they could get away with leaving me for dead in
the middle of the street.

00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:32.614
MATT: (laughs) That's awesome.

00:04:32.614 --> 00:04:38.635
ZAC: So let's break 420. The last announcement,
guys, is just a real quick community announcement.

00:04:38.635 --> 00:04:44.133
We like to pride ourselves at Geek &amp;amp; Sundry for
being a very open and loving and warm community,

00:04:44.133 --> 00:04:49.490
and that's absolutely the most important thing to
us and to Felicia and to a lot of our viewers, and

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.065
I know last week things got a little heated in the
chat room, and we just want to remind everyone

00:04:53.065 --> 00:04:57.592
that we don't get the opportunity to talk to you
much during the show, but we want to make sure you

00:04:57.592 --> 00:05:02.725
guys stay as positive as possible or I will have
to throw the hammer down on you.

00:05:02.725 --> 00:05:05.061
MATT: Shit. All right. There you--

00:05:05.061 --> 00:05:06.439
ZAC: That's pretty much it.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.719
MATT: You know, just goes to say that this
community is built on so many great, positive

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:14.130
people and such a wonderful sense of community,
and a big huge thanks and please share

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.801
appreciation for our fantastic mods who work
consistently and constantly throughout the day.

00:05:18.801 --> 00:05:19.795
ZAC: (sings) For free.

00:05:19.795 --> 00:05:20.869
MATT: For free.

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:22.654
ZAC: (laughs) You guys are crazy.

00:05:22.654 --> 00:05:25.342
MATT: Through our chatroom, which if you've
watched, as you're now seeing and have seen

00:05:25.342 --> 00:05:30.382
previous episodes, is I can only assume readable
by super mastermind computers at this point. So,

00:05:30.382 --> 00:05:34.465
you guys do an amazing job, it's really
appreciated and to all of you guys out there in

00:05:34.465 --> 00:05:40.551
the community, keep that positivity, keep that
understanding, and enjoy our game for its ups, for

00:05:40.551 --> 00:05:45.011
its downs, for our good character choices, bad
character choices. It's all an experience in a

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:52.144
story that we're all having together at the same
time. So, kick along, hold on, and keep smiling.

00:05:52.144 --> 00:05:53.065
ZAC: Well said, Matt.

00:05:53.065 --> 00:05:53.895
MATT: Yeah, thank you.

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:55.060
ZAC: We love you guys, kind of.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.968
(all laugh)

00:05:55.968 --> 00:05:57.649
MATT: I do. I love you. We do.

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:58.734
ZAC: I'm on the fence.

00:05:58.734 --> 00:05:59.668
MATT: He's a-- you know.

00:05:59.668 --> 00:06:00.877
LAURA: We love you so much!

00:06:00.877 --> 00:06:07.978
MATT: It's a thing. So yeah, so, couple other
announcements for you guys. What's our sub count

00:06:07.978 --> 00:06:10.851
right now? When's our next one hundred?

00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:14.220
CREW: 9.5k, 9,500.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:22.167
MATT: At 9,500 we will be giving away our signed
photo and signed art piece by Kit Buss to a random

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:26.260
person who's active in the chat. So next time we
hit that goal, we'll have that giveaway, which is

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:32.188
awesome. Once again, Extra Life has been our big
charity push right now. Everyone who's given,

00:06:32.188 --> 00:06:38.507
thank you so much. So, so much, and if ever you
want to be a part of helping that out we have the

00:06:38.507 --> 00:06:45.451
information there available for you, it goes to a
really great cause. Let's see, Sam will be here

00:06:45.451 --> 00:06:50.106
shortly. Unfortunately, we're down a Tiberius
tonight. However, yesterday was Orion's birthday,

00:06:50.106 --> 00:06:52.474
so feel free to go ahead and wish him a happy
birthday on Twitter.

00:06:52.474 --> 00:06:53.164
LAURA: Aw.

00:06:53.164 --> 00:06:54.050
LIAM: Happy birthday, Orion.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.248
TRAVIS: Happy birthday, buddy.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:59.378
MATT: Happy birthday, Orion. But yeah, Sam should
be here shortly. And, let's see, do we have any

00:06:59.378 --> 00:07:00.854
project announcements?

00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:02.076
LIAM: Just a project announcement?

00:07:02.076 --> 00:07:03.396
MATT: Or any other announcements you've got.

00:07:03.396 --> 00:07:06.784
LIAM: Hey, yesterday I started directing for the
World of Warcraft. So that's pretty good.

00:07:06.784 --> 00:07:07.718
LAURA: You did?

00:07:07.718 --> 00:07:08.872
(all cheer)

00:07:08.872 --> 00:07:09.757
MATT: Congratulations, buddy.

00:07:09.757 --> 00:07:10.805
LAURA: That's so great!

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:13.928
LIAM: I think it's gonna be ongoing and it was
really nice.

00:07:13.928 --> 00:07:14.950
TRAVIS: Big deal.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:15.832
MARISHA: I'm so excited for you!

00:07:15.832 --> 00:07:16.571
LAURA: That's super exciting.

00:07:16.571 --> 00:07:17.408
MATT: That's awesome.

00:07:17.408 --> 00:07:19.093
LIAM: Then anything right now?

00:07:19.093 --> 00:07:20.063
MARISHA: I'm so fangirly.

00:07:20.063 --> 00:07:20.856
MATT: Anything you want.

00:07:20.856 --> 00:07:25.253
LIAM: All right, I also want to thank Pupgames
from Twitter for sending me this.

00:07:25.253 --> 00:07:26.652
LAURA: Oh yeah.

00:07:26.652 --> 00:07:31.236
LIAM: Look at this. It came in the mail separate
and I have a hood and now I can just, you know, I

00:07:31.236 --> 00:07:34.694
can go like that and no one will see me so thank
you, Pupgames.

00:07:34.694 --> 00:07:37.278
MATT: That's awesome!

00:07:37.278 --> 00:07:40.716
LIAM: Let me set it here. I haven't figured out
how to wear it exactly, but I will.

00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:41.780
LAURA and MATT: (laugh)

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.677
TRAVIS: Take all your clothes off and then figure
it out.

00:07:44.677 --> 00:07:46.510
MATT: It's warm on the chesticles.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.889
LIAM: And then, I just want to take a minute, I
said thank you on Twitter, but I just want to

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:58.197
thank everybody who for the last week has sent me
well-wishes and today who has sent me well-wishes,

00:07:58.197 --> 00:08:05.315
and a lot of the Critter community got together
and made a video just to, you know, just support,

00:08:05.315 --> 00:08:12.037
support me in-- I am having a hard moment in my
personal life, not gonna get into it, but you guys

00:08:12.037 --> 00:08:17.499
kind of took my breath away today for real. So,
thank you very much.

00:08:17.734 --> 00:08:19.355
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:08:19.355 --> 00:08:20.745
MARISHA: We have the best fans.

00:08:20.745 --> 00:08:23.331
MATT: This whole community is brilliant, so you
guys.

00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:27.149
TALIESIN: So many of them in New York and in San
Francisco this week,

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:29.047
where we've been all over the place.

00:08:29.047 --> 00:08:31.710
MARISHA: Yes. Shout out to our New York and San
Fran.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.608
MATT: Yeah, we hit both coasts.

00:08:33.608 --> 00:08:36.876
MARISHA: San Francisco. Both coasts.

00:08:36.876 --> 00:08:42.810
MATT: Yeah, in the same week. It's crazy. Yeah, we
all went to New York Comic Con. We had a panel

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.949
that went really well. We had a bunch of great
critters come out and Team Hooman folks come and

00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:51.514
sit in the audience, ask questions. We had some
fun banter back and forth. We gave out 'Critical

00:08:51.514 --> 00:08:54.593
Rolls,' these cookies that were our little meal
deal.

00:08:54.593 --> 00:08:56.660
TALIESIN: That were neither critical nor rolls,
really to be fair.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.330
MATT: Right.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.097
TALIESIN: But they were good.

00:08:58.097 --> 00:08:59.001
MARISHA: But we're into it.

00:08:59.001 --> 00:08:59.730
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.332
MATT and MARISHA: Imaginary rolls.

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:02.784
MATT: Much like our realm is imaginary.

00:09:02.784 --> 00:09:05.167
TALIESIN: I may have hit a couple people in the
face, for which I greatly apologize.

00:09:05.167 --> 00:09:07.129
LAURA: I definitely hit somebody in the face with
one of those rolls.

00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:08.681
TALIESIN: Yeah, I like split someone's lip.

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:10.417
MATT: Completely unintentional, I'm sure.

00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:11.598
LAURA: I'm so sorry.

00:09:11.598 --> 00:09:13.231
LIAM: Her aim is excellent. She never misses.

00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:14.605
LAURA: Yes, I am an archer.

00:09:14.605 --> 00:09:16.616
TRAVIS: She Hunter's Marks that shit.

00:09:16.616 --> 00:09:18.892
LAURA: I Hunter's Marked your face.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.246
TALIESIN: And we played golf. It was quite nice.

00:09:20.246 --> 00:09:24.838
MATT: Also, thank you guys for coming out to that
event. Also, for those who came to see us at

00:09:24.838 --> 00:09:28.830
Forbidden Planet in New York, we had a great
turnout, and that comic shop wasn't quite

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.267
expecting what they were in for.

00:09:30.267 --> 00:09:31.505
TRAVIS: We weren't expecting that.

00:09:31.505 --> 00:09:33.536
MATT: We weren't expecting, but they especially
were like halfway through like, "Who are you

00:09:33.536 --> 00:09:36.259
"guys?! What is happening?!"

00:09:36.321 --> 00:09:37.293
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

00:09:37.293 --> 00:09:38.213
TRAVIS: We are legion.

00:09:38.213 --> 00:09:39.084
MARISHA: We freaked out our Uber driver.

00:09:39.084 --> 00:09:39.857
MATT: Yeah we did.

00:09:39.857 --> 00:09:40.372
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:42.492
MATT: We pulled up and got out of the car and all
of a sudden it was like hundreds of people

00:09:42.492 --> 00:09:45.856
cheering and we all went "What?!" and the Uber
driver went "What?!?"

00:09:45.856 --> 00:09:48.276
TALIESIN: I think his exact words is, "Is this for
us?"

00:09:48.276 --> 00:09:50.147
(all laugh)

00:09:50.147 --> 00:09:51.502
MATT: And even we were like "I don't know."

00:09:51.502 --> 00:09:52.947
LAURA: I don't know!

00:09:52.947 --> 00:09:55.222
MATT: You guys were amazing. Thank you for that.

00:09:55.222 --> 00:09:59.167
MARISHA: I feel like we need to find and screen
cap in the thread where we were like, 20, 30

00:09:59.167 --> 00:10:01.021
people, guys. Let's not get our hopes up.

00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:01.910
LAURA: Yeah.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.474
LIAM: Well, that's who got back to me, was like, I
don't know, 40ish.

00:10:04.474 --> 00:10:06.945
LAURA: Yeah, we thought it was gonna be like 40
people.

00:10:06.945 --> 00:10:08.590
MATT: Yeah, that was a good turnout.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:10.012
LAURA: That-- pretty great. Was great. Pretty
great.

00:10:10.012 --> 00:10:11.116
LIAM: It was pretty metal.

00:10:11.116 --> 00:10:12.309
TALIESIN: The internet went, nope.

00:10:12.309 --> 00:10:17.993
MATT: Yeah. Other announcements: Coming up in I
think the next couple weeks or so, the release of

00:10:17.993 --> 00:10:20.252
the Minecraft Story Mode.

00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:21.065
MARISHA: (whispers) Yeah.

00:10:21.065 --> 00:10:22.309
TRAVIS: (sings) Yeah.

00:10:22.309 --> 00:10:25.898
MATT: Comes out on Xbox. Completely a fun show. We
went to the Archlight Let's Play of it they did,

00:10:25.898 --> 00:10:28.863
which was really a lot of fun. I play the
characters Aiden and Otis in it.

00:10:28.863 --> 00:10:30.733
MARISHA: Hundreds of screaming children.
Screaming, yeah.

00:10:30.733 --> 00:10:33.531
MATT: Yes, lots of screaming children. Yeah, so I
play Aiden and Otis and a smattering of other

00:10:33.531 --> 00:10:37.266
characters throughout. I think Sam also worked on
it. Anyone else?

00:10:37.266 --> 00:10:39.476
ALL: Ashley.

00:10:39.476 --> 00:10:41.079
MATT: That's right, Ashley Johnson, our very own
Pike!

00:10:41.079 --> 00:10:42.366
LIAM: She's one of the mains.

00:10:42.366 --> 00:10:46.160
MATT: Yeah, she's one of the main characters in
that show. So if you're a Minecraft fan and you

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.525
like Telltale and you have an Xbox, check it out.

00:10:48.525 --> 00:10:52.861
LAURA: Speaking of Telltale, the final episode of
Tales from the Borderlands comes out next week.

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:53.889
TRAVIS: Oh snap!

00:10:53.889 --> 00:10:54.762
LAURA: Episode five, what!

00:10:54.762 --> 00:10:56.459
TALIESIN: Yeah!

00:10:56.459 --> 00:10:57.637
MATT: Awesome!

00:10:57.637 --> 00:10:58.585
LAURA: Exciting.

00:10:58.585 --> 00:10:59.472
MATT: (sings) Yeah.

00:10:59.472 --> 00:11:05.087
TALIESIN: Also in that role, if any Critters are
in the Galveston area for Halloween, I will be at

00:11:05.087 --> 00:11:13.256
OniCon over Halloween weekend. So, you can come
say hi in beautiful Galveston by the sea.

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:15.184
Galveston, Texas.

00:11:15.184 --> 00:11:17.123
MATT: There you go.

00:11:17.123 --> 00:11:19.238
TALIESIN: I'll be wearing a costume. It'll be
great.

00:11:19.238 --> 00:11:20.016
MATT: Perfect.

00:11:20.016 --> 00:11:21.015
LIAM: We have a gnome.

00:11:21.015 --> 00:11:21.847
LAURA: We have a gnome.

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:23.453
TALIESIN: We have gnome? Oh god!

00:11:23.453 --> 00:11:25.273
MARISHA: You're in Minecraft, right? Story mode.

00:11:25.273 --> 00:11:26.158
SAM: Yes I am.

00:11:26.158 --> 00:11:26.797
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:11:26.797 --> 00:11:27.881
SAM: In fact you and I--

00:11:27.881 --> 00:11:29.164
MATT: I think we have a couple scenes together.

00:11:29.164 --> 00:11:33.018
SAM: We do something together, I don't know what.
Or you're playing a version of me or something,

00:11:33.018 --> 00:11:34.520
I don't remember.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.237
MATT: I can only assume that it's tawdry.

00:11:37.237 --> 00:11:42.257
SAM: (laughs) The director told me something about
you and I just assume we're probably having sex in

00:11:42.257 --> 00:11:43.012
the game.

00:11:43.012 --> 00:11:43.919
MATT: Probably.

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:44.796
SAM: Yeah, okay.

00:11:44.796 --> 00:11:46.886
MATT: It's just like an extended, fully
interactive too. Talk about choices you make that

00:11:46.886 --> 00:11:50.219
affect the storyline. (laughs)

00:11:50.219 --> 00:11:53.690
TALIESIN: I blank out in the booth any time they
mention his name.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:56.913
MATT: But yeah, cool, guys. Any announcements
anyone want to talk about,

00:11:56.913 --> 00:11:59.047
or shall we get things started?

00:11:59.047 --> 00:12:01.067
LAURA: Let's do it!

00:12:01.067 --> 00:12:01.866
MATT: All right, let's do it.

00:12:01.866 --> 00:12:02.512
MARISHA: Do it!

00:12:02.512 --> 00:12:03.403
LIAM: Wait, where did Grog go?

00:12:03.403 --> 00:12:04.231
TALIESIN: Wait, wait, wait.

00:12:04.231 --> 00:12:04.728
SAM: He'll be here.

00:12:04.728 --> 00:12:07.606
MATT: Grog, he'll be here in a minute but in the
meantime, let's go ahead and dial in for the next

00:12:07.606 --> 00:12:09.000
episode of Critical Role.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:09.894
TALIESIN: Dun dun dun dun.

00:12:09.894 --> 00:13:16.270
[opening credits]

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:26.977
MATT: Welcome back. So. Sh. (laughs) So, to go
over the current adventure in its current

00:13:26.977 --> 00:13:32.623
sequence, we have-- the party recently had an
encounter with the Briarwoods. Two individuals

00:13:32.623 --> 00:13:34.840
that were responsible for a lot of strife--

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.693
LIAM: Dicks!

00:13:35.693 --> 00:13:39.011
MATT: -- in the background of Percival's history.
Seemingly responsible for the destruction of his

00:13:39.011 --> 00:13:47.303
entire family, and have for the past five years
been essentially ruling his home city and castle.

00:13:47.303 --> 00:13:53.255
They were out for a political banquet with
Sovereign Uriel in Emon and the party members of

00:13:53.255 --> 00:13:57.967
Vox Machina, they were all invited to be part of
this. Didn't quite go as planned. There was a

00:13:57.967 --> 00:14:03.719
scuffle and the Briarwoods absconded back to
Whitestone. They sent a couple assassins out to

00:14:03.719 --> 00:14:10.268
attempt to take out their driver, who was spilling
information and essentially was going to be Vox

00:14:10.268 --> 00:14:16.589
Machina's way of being free of any sort of
political issues based on their actions that

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:24.891
evening, and after much discussion and preparation
and purchasing a lot of mirrors, the party took

00:14:24.891 --> 00:14:31.339
their transit over to the east-northeast towards
Whitestone, where they began to traverse the

00:14:31.339 --> 00:14:38.453
Alabaster Sierras to the north, using the mountain
range as opposed to going directly through the

00:14:38.453 --> 00:14:44.909
forest. There they managed to avoid encountering a
bunch of harpies that were distracted by eating

00:14:44.909 --> 00:14:46.396
the horses they left behind.

00:14:46.396 --> 00:14:47.304
TRAVIS: Damn.

00:14:47.304 --> 00:14:51.075
MATT: They camped for the evening and began to
make their way through some sort of a mountainous

00:14:51.075 --> 00:14:57.399
valley that led in towards the forest surrounding
Whitestone. While they were traveling down this

00:14:57.399 --> 00:15:02.568
pass, there was a rumbling, and some sort of
really fast, rapid-moving large blue creature that

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:09.146
leaped down in front, catching them off-guard. And
that is where we begin today.

00:15:09.146 --> 00:15:10.690
TRAVIS: Probably should have fucking researched
that creature.

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:11.983
TALIESIN: Did the creature look like that?

00:15:11.983 --> 00:15:12.857
MATT: That blue creature.

00:15:12.857 --> 00:15:13.846
LAURA: Yeah, right? That would have been smart.

00:15:13.846 --> 00:15:14.492
TALIESIN: Okay, just checking.

00:15:14.492 --> 00:15:15.410
TRAVIS: I never do that.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:16.530
LAURA: I know. So dumb.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:17.455
SAM: What's dumb?

00:15:17.455 --> 00:15:18.220
TRAVIS: I have a question.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.544
LAURA: That we didn't research that creature.

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.021
TRAVIS: What did you roll on your beard check?

00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:21.867
MATT: What'd I roll on my beard check?

00:15:21.867 --> 00:15:22.994
LAURA: I know, it's growing!

00:15:22.994 --> 00:15:23.917
MARISHA: It's metagaming, you can't. We're not
allowed.

00:15:23.917 --> 00:15:25.415
MATT: Well, obviously.

00:15:25.415 --> 00:15:26.345
(all laugh)

00:15:26.345 --> 00:15:27.436
MATT: Well, No Shave 'Til 10k.

00:15:27.436 --> 00:15:28.143
TRAVIS: That's true!

00:15:28.143 --> 00:15:30.848
MATT: And my Halloween costume requires a decent
amount of facial hair.

00:15:30.848 --> 00:15:31.706
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right.

00:15:31.706 --> 00:15:35.592
TRAVIS: A sexy amount of facial hair, you beast!
Be glad there's a table between you and I.

00:15:35.592 --> 00:15:37.615
(all laugh)

00:15:37.615 --> 00:15:40.300
LIAM: I was a little worried about some
performance capture coming up,

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.097
but it got moved back--

00:15:42.097 --> 00:15:43.137
LAURA: So you can shave--

00:15:43.137 --> 00:15:44.220
LIAM: Off to the races.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:44.996
MATT: Yeah!

00:15:44.996 --> 00:15:47.873
LAURA: How far are we from 10K?

00:15:47.873 --> 00:15:48.612
TRAVIS: I gotta shave tonight.

00:15:48.612 --> 00:15:50.091
CREW: 509.

00:15:50.091 --> 00:15:51.047
MATT: 509 away.

00:15:51.047 --> 00:15:51.983
LAURA: All right.

00:15:51.983 --> 00:15:52.756
SAM: So, like, tomorrow.

00:15:52.756 --> 00:15:53.589
MARISHA: Yeah, no.

00:15:53.589 --> 00:15:54.415
MATT: We'll see.

00:15:54.415 --> 00:15:55.292
MARISHA: Tonight.

00:15:55.292 --> 00:16:03.221
MATT: All right, so, everyone. As this huge,
blue-scaled reptilian-like creature with multiple

00:16:03.221 --> 00:16:09.453
arms and legs comes skittering down the side of
the cliffs, blocking off the entirety of this

00:16:09.453 --> 00:16:15.602
passage, snarling at you with sharp teeth and this
sparking-blue electrical energy jutting out of the

00:16:15.602 --> 00:16:18.726
corners of its mouth. I want you all to roll
initiative.

00:16:21.447 --> 00:16:23.723
MARISHA: So soon! Which one?

00:16:23.723 --> 00:16:26.251
SAM: I add 20 to this, right, that's how it
works?

00:16:27.567 --> 00:16:30.161
MARISHA: Not good.

00:16:30.161 --> 00:16:32.184
LAURA: Oh no!

00:16:32.184 --> 00:16:33.151
SAM: See you guys in--

00:16:33.151 --> 00:16:34.282
MARISHA: Always cocked!

00:16:34.282 --> 00:16:35.290
TRAVIS: I didn't level up! What a dick.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:36.201
MARISHA: Still not great.

00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:37.653
LIAM: Wait, you did but you didn't, is what you're
saying?

00:16:37.653 --> 00:16:38.744
TRAVIS: I did, but I didn't.

00:16:38.744 --> 00:16:39.762
LIAM: Add some hit points!

00:16:39.762 --> 00:16:40.865
LAURA: Yeah, add your points right now.

00:16:40.865 --> 00:16:41.712
LIAM: Add some hit points!

00:16:41.712 --> 00:16:42.602
TRAVIS: How many do I add?

00:16:42.602 --> 00:16:43.169
MARISHA: It's like--

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.555
MATT: 1d12 plus your constitution modifier!

00:16:44.555 --> 00:16:45.606
LAURA: 1d12!

00:16:45.606 --> 00:16:46.803
MARISHA: Barbarian, man!

00:16:46.803 --> 00:16:47.971
LIAM: Hey, we play D&amp;amp;D!

00:16:47.971 --> 00:16:48.965
LAURA: Hey, that's good! Plus--

00:16:48.965 --> 00:16:49.754
LIAM: Plus--

00:16:49.754 --> 00:16:51.450
LAURA: Whoa! 16 extra health points!

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.014
MATT: Whoa, what'd you roll?!

00:16:53.014 --> 00:16:54.276
LAURA: He rolled an 11 plus five!

00:16:54.276 --> 00:16:55.511
LIAM: Dang!

00:16:55.511 --> 00:16:56.524
MARISHA: That's hot.

00:16:56.524 --> 00:16:58.752
MATT: That's pretty hot. So many hit points for
the barbarian.

00:16:58.752 --> 00:17:01.373
LIAM: And, if you want, you can just boost to, are
you at 12 now?

00:17:01.373 --> 00:17:02.950
TRAVIS: What?

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.564
LIAM: Level 12? Are you at level 12?

00:17:04.564 --> 00:17:07.401
LAURA: Don't complicate things.

00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:09.123
LIAM: Just smash, smash, Hulk smash.

00:17:09.123 --> 00:17:11.860
SAM: How many spells does he get?

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:16.246
MATT: All of them. All right, so initiatives we
have-- 25 to 20, anyone?

00:17:16.246 --> 00:17:19.171
TALIESIN: 21.

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:26.462
MATT: All right. 20 to 15?

00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:28.231
LAURA: 19.

00:17:28.231 --> 00:17:30.142
TRAVIS: Me too. 16.

00:17:30.142 --> 00:17:34.082
MATT: 16? 15 to ten?

00:17:34.082 --> 00:17:35.952
MARISHA: Ten.

00:17:35.952 --> 00:17:39.614
MATT: Ten, Keyleth. Ten to five?

00:17:39.614 --> 00:17:44.374
LIAM: Eight! I consistently botch this roll.

00:17:44.374 --> 00:17:48.462
SAM: See you guys in like an hour. I got a four.

00:17:48.462 --> 00:17:51.562
MATT: Scanlan, you have consistently the best
initiative rolls.

00:17:51.562 --> 00:17:53.914
SAM: Oh, yeah. I save it for when it counts.

00:17:53.914 --> 00:17:58.542
MATT: As you should, as you should. So, first up:
Percy. Instinctively, with your drive towards

00:17:58.542 --> 00:18:02.514
Whitestone and this creature in your way, you are
already ready for this encounter. What are you

00:18:02.514 --> 00:18:04.153
going to do?

00:18:04.153 --> 00:18:09.562
TALIESIN: It's bigger than sin, isn't it?

00:18:09.562 --> 00:18:11.855
MATT: It is considered a huge creature.

00:18:11.855 --> 00:18:21.322
TALIESIN: Okay, so, I'm going to alert everybody,
get down! And I'm going to take three shots--

00:18:21.322 --> 00:18:23.203
SAM: You're just going to start shooting.

00:18:23.203 --> 00:18:24.016
TALIESIN: Hmm?

00:18:24.016 --> 00:18:25.271
SAM: You're just going to start shooting.

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:26.903
TALIESIN: I'm just going to-- look at that
thing!!

00:18:26.903 --> 00:18:28.456
MARISHA: Hey, Percy gonna do what Percy gonna do.

00:18:28.456 --> 00:18:29.881
SAM: What if you could reason with him?

00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:31.565
LAURA: He is definitely--

00:18:31.565 --> 00:18:36.899
TALIESIN: Why doesn't it reason with me, is what
I'm asking! It could reason with me!

00:18:36.899 --> 00:18:39.356
LIAM: There's a lot of heads in the way. Just aim
true.

00:18:39.356 --> 00:18:43.214
TALIESIN: I'm aiming, I'm going to use the
Sharpshooter for extra damage.

00:18:43.214 --> 00:18:44.133
MATT: All righty.

00:18:44.133 --> 00:18:45.772
TALIESIN: Three pepperbox shots.

00:18:45.772 --> 00:18:48.027
LIAM: I will be less handsome with one ear, I'm
just saying.

00:18:48.027 --> 00:18:49.169
MATT: With the minus five.

00:18:49.169 --> 00:18:51.375
TALIESIN: Yeah, so that's 17.

00:18:51.375 --> 00:18:53.057
MATT: 17 hits.

00:18:53.057 --> 00:18:55.638
Just go ahead and roll the attacks in
succession.

00:18:55.638 --> 00:18:56.516
TALIESIN: Hmm?

00:18:56.516 --> 00:18:58.310
MATT: Go ahead and roll the attacks in succession
so we know how many hit.

00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:59.500
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.798
MATT: Second shot.

00:19:00.798 --> 00:19:05.700
TALIESIN: Second one, it hits, 18 plus seven.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.810
MATT: It hits. Third one?

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:14.471
TALIESIN: For the third one, I'm going to go for a
head shot instead of a Sharpshooter.

00:19:14.471 --> 00:19:16.800
MATT: Okay.

00:19:17.892 --> 00:19:19.567
TALIESIN: And that's 21.

00:19:19.567 --> 00:19:21.406
MATT: Okay, all three hit. Go ahead and roll
damage.

00:19:25.876 --> 00:19:28.947
TRAVIS: The dark cloud aids his rolls.

00:19:28.947 --> 00:19:29.919
LAURA: (whispers) Vengeance!

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.058
TALIESIN: 17.

00:19:31.058 --> 00:19:32.206
MATT: 17 damage.

00:19:32.206 --> 00:19:33.474
LAURA: (whispers) Vengeance!

00:19:33.474 --> 00:19:34.667
TALIESIN: Better!

00:19:34.667 --> 00:19:35.511
TRAVIS: Vengeance!

00:19:35.511 --> 00:19:37.104
TALIESIN: 25.

00:19:37.104 --> 00:19:38.175
MATT: All righty!

00:19:38.175 --> 00:19:44.557
TALIESIN: That went really well. The last one-- do
I do any damage when I hit the head? Normal

00:19:44.557 --> 00:19:51.264
damage. So, last one is seven points of damage
plus he's got--

00:19:51.264 --> 00:19:53.164
MATT: Disadvantage on his attacks this round.

00:19:53.164 --> 00:19:54.279
TALIESIN: Yeah, disadvantage on attacks.

00:19:54.279 --> 00:19:56.221
MATT: Gotcha. Do you want to stay where you are,
or are you going to move?

00:19:56.221 --> 00:19:59.006
TALIESIN: Am I touching a wall?

00:19:59.006 --> 00:20:01.471
MATT: You're right close to one. You can--

00:20:01.471 --> 00:20:03.166
LAURA: Stop touching me. Stop touching me.

00:20:03.166 --> 00:20:04.813
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to brace against a
wall.

00:20:04.813 --> 00:20:06.629
MATT: Okay. Brace against that wall, there.
Gotcha.

00:20:06.629 --> 00:20:09.069
TALIESIN: And I'm going to mark all this off.

00:20:09.069 --> 00:20:17.401
MATT: All righty. Okay. Next up is the creature.

00:20:17.401 --> 00:20:18.671
LAURA: Argh.

00:20:18.671 --> 00:20:21.906
MATT: (Laughs) Because it rolled really high on
its initiative. It's going to go ahead. Let's see,

00:20:21.906 --> 00:20:23.605
at a movement of 50 feet.

00:20:23.605 --> 00:20:24.494
LIAM: Oh god.

00:20:24.494 --> 00:20:25.462
LAURA: (gasps)

00:20:25.462 --> 00:20:26.463
TRAVIS: (whispers) Are we in a valley? Or are
we--

00:20:26.463 --> 00:20:27.813
LAURA: We're in a freaking--

00:20:27.813 --> 00:20:28.877
MARISHA: We're in a death trap.

00:20:28.877 --> 00:20:29.824
LIAM: It crawled down the wall.

00:20:29.824 --> 00:20:31.190
SAM: No, it's going to be fine, guys. We're like
a--

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.411
TALIESIN: We're outdoors.

00:20:32.411 --> 00:20:34.473
SAM: The valley is like a taco shell.

00:20:34.473 --> 00:20:36.611
LAURA: Is it a valley, or is it like those are
cliff sides and we could fall?

00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:38.089
MATT: It's a valley. The cliff sides go up.

00:20:38.089 --> 00:20:39.711
SAM: Yeah, it's like a taco shell and we're the
meat.

00:20:39.711 --> 00:20:40.429
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:20:40.429 --> 00:20:41.197
LAURA: Okay.

00:20:41.197 --> 00:20:42.014
MARISHA: And we're-- Yeah. Yeah.

00:20:42.014 --> 00:20:42.649
(all laugh)

00:20:42.649 --> 00:20:44.587
MATT: You could climb around it without a problem.
But it's pretty sheer. You'd have to make climb

00:20:44.587 --> 00:20:45.793
checks if you want to--

00:20:45.793 --> 00:20:46.869
MARISHA: Yep, accurate.

00:20:46.869 --> 00:20:47.761
LIAM: We're in a tight spot.

00:20:47.761 --> 00:20:48.603
LAURA: Okay. Got it.

00:20:48.603 --> 00:20:49.500
LIAM: We're in a tight spot.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.372
MARISHA: Unless you're in Japan.

00:20:50.372 --> 00:20:51.107
MATT: So it scurries forward--

00:20:51.107 --> 00:20:51.812
TALIESIN: Taco.

00:20:51.812 --> 00:20:53.615
MATT: Lowers its jaw and rears its head back. As
it does, you see its eyes flare with electrical

00:20:53.615 --> 00:20:56.919
energy and inside its mouth begins to glow with a
brightish blue, white power.

00:20:56.919 --> 00:20:57.836
LIAM: Get down.

00:20:57.836 --> 00:21:05.002
MATT: A bolt of electrical energy comes forward,
hitting Grog, Vax, Scanlan, and Percy.

00:21:05.163 --> 00:21:07.154
TRAVIS: It's electrifying!

00:21:07.154 --> 00:21:08.323
LAURA: Electrified.

00:21:08.323 --> 00:21:14.407
MATT: Well, let's see. Actually, no, it would move
out to-- Hmm, that's only 20 feet, so to get

00:21:14.407 --> 00:21:18.837
maximum-- This, let's see.

00:21:18.837 --> 00:21:20.054
SAM: Maybe it doesn't do math well.

00:21:20.054 --> 00:21:21.143
LAURA: Don't think about it, just go.

00:21:21.143 --> 00:21:23.055
SAM: Maybe it doesn't know math well. Maybe it
doesn't move right.

00:21:23.055 --> 00:21:24.511
LAURA: Don't calculate it, Matt. It's fine.

00:21:24.511 --> 00:21:25.580
MATT: No, actually for optimal--

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:26.454
LAURA: Fuck.

00:21:26.454 --> 00:21:27.973
MATT: --optimal impact here, instead, it's going
to go there.

00:21:27.973 --> 00:21:29.548
TRAVIS: I have to put my head in its mouth?

00:21:29.548 --> 00:21:31.422
MATT: (laughs) Practically.

00:21:31.422 --> 00:21:32.793
LIAM: (laughs) Eh.

00:21:32.793 --> 00:21:36.095
MATT: It will then do it on-- It would be Grog,
Vex, and Trinket.

00:21:36.095 --> 00:21:38.078
SAM: I approve of that.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:46.075
MATT: I realized that its bolt is only 20 feet
long. So, utilizing its optimal Lightning Bolt

00:21:46.075 --> 00:21:47.842
length, you guys were clustered together.

00:21:47.842 --> 00:21:48.644
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:21:48.644 --> 00:21:51.803
MATT: All right, so I need you guys, you three, to
roll a dexterity saving throw.

00:21:52.374 --> 00:21:53.720
TALIESIN: With advantage?

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.738
LAURA: With advantage because I'm in the
mountains?

00:21:55.738 --> 00:21:58.814
MATT: You do it with advantage. It only affects
attacks, not for saving throws.

00:21:58.814 --> 00:22:00.293
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right. This is a magic save.

00:22:00.293 --> 00:22:02.274
TRAVIS: 19.

00:22:02.327 --> 00:22:04.344
MATT: Good to know.

00:22:04.921 --> 00:22:06.032
TALIESIN: I probably should spend Grit.

00:22:06.032 --> 00:22:06.917
LAURA: 21.

00:22:06.917 --> 00:22:08.292
MATT: All right. And Trinket?

00:22:08.292 --> 00:22:10.433
LAURA: Argh.

00:22:10.433 --> 00:22:11.480
LIAM: (Chewbacca sounds)

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.331
LAURA: (growls) Eight. Yay.

00:22:16.331 --> 00:22:17.538
MATT: He got an eight?

00:22:17.538 --> 00:22:18.952
LAURA: He got a eight.

00:22:18.952 --> 00:22:22.154
MATT: Oof, okay. 33 points of lightning damage to
both of you.

00:22:22.154 --> 00:22:23.493
LAURA: (gasps)

00:22:23.493 --> 00:22:24.765
SAM: Wait, that means--

00:22:24.765 --> 00:22:25.900
MATT: Trinket takes 66.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:26.986
SAM: 66?

00:22:26.986 --> 00:22:28.322
LAURA: Trinket's fucking dead, yo.

00:22:28.322 --> 00:22:29.021
SAM: What?!

00:22:29.021 --> 00:22:30.307
MATT: Unconscious.

00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:31.872
LAURA: That fast?!

00:22:31.872 --> 00:22:33.915
TRAVIS: Which one: dead or unconscious?

00:22:33.915 --> 00:22:34.758
LAURA: He's unconscious.

00:22:34.758 --> 00:22:35.831
TALIESIN: Unconscious.

00:22:35.831 --> 00:22:38.756
TRAVIS: Don't throw around the "D" word, unless
it's the "D" word time.

00:22:38.756 --> 00:22:43.887
MATT: So, as there was a crackling of energy
forward, you two brace yourself, managing to get

00:22:43.887 --> 00:22:47.341
mostly out of the way. Unfortunately, both of you
dodging out of the way leaves an open shot for

00:22:47.341 --> 00:22:52.756
bear, that just takes the brunt of it, throwing
Trinket up against the side of the actual

00:22:52.756 --> 00:22:58.194
mountainous cavern. And slumps to the ground,
smoking off the fur.

00:23:00.154 --> 00:23:02.123
LAURA: Does Trinket have to make saving throws?

00:23:02.123 --> 00:23:02.966
MATT: Yes.

00:23:02.966 --> 00:23:04.360
LIAM: Death saving throws? Yes.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.842
MARISHA: No one has any resistance, spell
resistance?

00:23:05.842 --> 00:23:08.028
MATT: Not yet. Until we get to his turn. That will
end--

00:23:08.028 --> 00:23:09.200
LAURA: Ooh, ooh, wait.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.710
MARISHA: Forgetting-- Your armor? I've got a spell
you're--

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.496
LAURA: He's only got 42 hit points.

00:23:14.496 --> 00:23:15.550
MATT: Yeah.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:16.622
SAM: Whoa.

00:23:16.622 --> 00:23:19.484
MATT: Technically, he should have more from
leveling up. But, even more wouldn't be that much

00:23:19.484 --> 00:23:25.386
higher, so-- Okay, so that's rough. That ends its
turn. Vex, you're up first.

00:23:25.386 --> 00:23:27.688
(all laugh)

00:23:27.688 --> 00:23:28.699
TRAVIS: She would like to rage.

00:23:28.699 --> 00:23:29.708
MARISHA: (as Matt) So that sucks, but--

00:23:29.708 --> 00:23:31.788
LAURA: Vengeance! Vengeance.

00:23:31.788 --> 00:23:33.983
TALIESIN: Say your soul is forfeit.

00:23:33.983 --> 00:23:35.837
LAURA: I'm going to Hunter's Mark him.

00:23:35.837 --> 00:23:37.105
MATT: All righty.

00:23:37.105 --> 00:23:45.061
LAURA: And then I'm going to-- Why is he closer
now? Sorry, Grog.

00:23:45.061 --> 00:23:47.548
I'm going to Hail of Thorns him.

00:23:47.548 --> 00:23:48.765
MATT: All righty.

00:23:48.765 --> 00:23:51.022
SAM: Grog is always in the way.

00:23:51.022 --> 00:23:51.984
LAURA: Yeah, well--

00:23:51.984 --> 00:23:54.771
TRAVIS: I do need a good back tickle.

00:23:55.532 --> 00:23:56.941
LIAM: (as Grog) Got an itch back there.

00:23:56.941 --> 00:23:58.956
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs)

00:23:58.956 --> 00:24:00.479
LAURA: 30.

00:24:00.479 --> 00:24:01.458
MATT: 30 hits.

00:24:01.458 --> 00:24:04.306
LAURA: No, wait, that's wrong. No, 30.

00:24:04.306 --> 00:24:05.739
MATT: 30 hits.

00:24:05.739 --> 00:24:12.282
LAURA: (sighs) I'm so angry right now! Thorn's
d--

00:24:12.282 --> 00:24:13.732
TRAVIS: It's not at me for once.

00:24:13.805 --> 00:24:17.183
LAURA: Ten. (sighs) 3d10.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.661
TALIESIN: For once, you're not the one doing
damage to the bear.

00:24:19.661 --> 00:24:21.922
TRAVIS: That's good.

00:24:22.876 --> 00:24:25.924
LAURA: 18 plus two is 20.

00:24:25.924 --> 00:24:30.126
MARISHA: It's a bonus action, so we can do other
shit if Scanlan and I both do it.

00:24:30.126 --> 00:24:30.980
LAURA: What is that?

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:31.765
TRAVIS: 22.

00:24:31.765 --> 00:24:32.952
LAURA: 22.

00:24:32.952 --> 00:24:34.299
MATT: 22 also hits.

00:24:34.299 --> 00:24:35.102
LAURA: No, that's the attack.

00:24:35.102 --> 00:24:37.235
MATT: That's the damage. Okay, gotcha. And Grog,
also--

00:24:37.235 --> 00:24:40.471
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

00:24:40.471 --> 00:24:41.776
MATT: Because you're right next to it.

00:24:41.776 --> 00:24:45.871
TRAVIS: (posh accent) Would that be considered
piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing damage?

00:24:46.273 --> 00:24:48.293
MATT: (posh accent) It doesn't matter, you have
not taken your turn to rage yet.

00:24:48.293 --> 00:24:49.564
TRAVIS: (posh accent) Oh fucking shit.

00:24:49.564 --> 00:24:51.258
(all laugh)

00:24:51.258 --> 00:24:52.516
MATT: That would be full damage upon you, Grog.

00:24:52.516 --> 00:24:53.566
TRAVIS: Ow! (laughs)

00:24:53.566 --> 00:24:57.856
LAURA: Oh shit, I'm sorry. The other one was 27.

00:24:57.856 --> 00:25:02.073
MATT: To hit? Okay.

00:25:02.429 --> 00:25:07.540
LAURA: Awoo. Ten plus--

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.489
SAM: Angry d10.

00:25:09.489 --> 00:25:12.161
LAURA: Plus 15.

00:25:12.161 --> 00:25:14.141
MATT: 15. That's including the Hunter's Mark,
right?

00:25:14.141 --> 00:25:14.937
LAURA: Yes.

00:25:14.937 --> 00:25:16.208
MATT: All right, good.

00:25:16.208 --> 00:25:22.317
LAURA: Oh wait, no, I wasn't adding the seven.
Wait no, that's a lie. That's a 15, 16, 17, plus

00:25:22.317 --> 00:25:23.756
five. 21.

00:25:23.756 --> 00:25:29.528
MATT: 21, got it. So, as you look over and you see
Trinket on the ground, smoldering spire of smoke

00:25:29.528 --> 00:25:30.843
pouring off of his body--

00:25:30.843 --> 00:25:32.240
LAURA: Can I pull him? Can I pull him out of the
way?

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.168
MARISHA: Smells like burnt fur.

00:25:33.168 --> 00:25:34.166
SAM: Burnt fur.

00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:35.736
LAURA: Just pull him into the little crevice, for
my move.

00:25:35.736 --> 00:25:36.914
MATT: This way, do you mean?

00:25:36.914 --> 00:25:39.208
LAURA: For my move. Is that a move action, or
would it be an action-action?

00:25:39.208 --> 00:25:40.738
MATT: That would be more of an action-action,
unfortunately.

00:25:40.738 --> 00:25:42.451
LAURA: Ugh. Oh no.

00:25:42.451 --> 00:25:48.063
MATT: But you angrily turn around, release your
arrow, firing a completely furious Hail of Thorns

00:25:48.063 --> 00:25:53.177
into the creature. As it hits, it shatters across
its hide, some of it scattering onto Grog. You

00:25:53.177 --> 00:25:56.602
don't even care. You just focus the anger, pull
out a second arrow, unleash this one. Actually

00:25:56.602 --> 00:26:00.967
jamming underneath one of the scales. You can see
a little trickle of dark, deep purple blood

00:26:00.967 --> 00:26:02.391
beginning to pour from the wound.

00:26:02.391 --> 00:26:04.276
LAURA: I get out of the line.

00:26:04.276 --> 00:26:05.400
MATT: Okay, where do you want to go?

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.728
LAURA: Towards the little crevice.

00:26:06.728 --> 00:26:07.438
MATT: Right there?

00:26:07.438 --> 00:26:08.127
LAURA: Yeah.

00:26:08.127 --> 00:26:09.012
MATT: Okay.

00:26:09.012 --> 00:26:09.764
MARISHA: Did we lose--

00:26:09.764 --> 00:26:11.104
LAURA: But I still want to be near Trinket.

00:26:11.104 --> 00:26:12.541
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn. Grog, you're up.

00:26:12.541 --> 00:26:15.619
TRAVIS: Getting ass-lit up with the Hail of
Thorns, I go into a rage.

00:26:15.619 --> 00:26:16.943
LAURA: I'm so sorry.

00:26:16.943 --> 00:26:17.783
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

00:26:17.783 --> 00:26:19.020
TRAVIS: I go into a Frenzied Rage!

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:19.960
MATT: All righty.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.672
TRAVIS: And I would like to attack three times
with my flaming warhammer.

00:26:22.672 --> 00:26:23.498
MATT: Certainly.

00:26:23.498 --> 00:26:24.857
LIAM: No more shopping today.

00:26:24.857 --> 00:26:26.734
TRAVIS: That is 24.

00:26:26.734 --> 00:26:28.811
MATT: That hits.

00:26:28.811 --> 00:26:29.714
TRAVIS: 21?

00:26:29.714 --> 00:26:31.395
MATT: That hits.

00:26:31.395 --> 00:26:32.673
TRAVIS: Eee! 26.

00:26:32.673 --> 00:26:33.770
MATT: That also hits.

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:38.038
TRAVIS: Nice. Those were really good rolls. Okay.
First one is 11.

00:26:38.038 --> 00:26:39.303
LAURA: I think I missed a box.

00:26:39.303 --> 00:26:42.890
TRAVIS: 13? First one.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:44.201
MATT: 13 damage. Good to know.

00:26:44.201 --> 00:26:45.543
TALIESIN: Brought another sign.

00:26:45.543 --> 00:26:47.929
TRAVIS: 14 for the second one.

00:26:47.929 --> 00:26:49.028
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

00:26:49.028 --> 00:26:50.061
MATT: Mm-hm.

00:26:50.061 --> 00:26:55.331
TRAVIS: Yes. 17 and 18, 19, 20, 21 plus the fire
damage.

00:26:55.331 --> 00:26:56.379
MATT: Good to know.

00:26:56.379 --> 00:26:57.443
TRAVIS: Including fire damage.

00:26:57.443 --> 00:27:02.733
MATT: All right, so, going into the rage, you just
see that same fury. You can smell the burnt hair

00:27:02.733 --> 00:27:07.360
in the air and you use that to fuel that moment of
pain. You just (impact sounds) and just start

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.948
bludgeoning the creature right up in its face. You
can see it's thrashing and snarling at you and

00:27:10.948 --> 00:27:18.671
snapping with each blow. You guys are locked in
this titan-versus-human battle right now. Cool,

00:27:18.671 --> 00:27:20.859
and are you going to stay where you are?

00:27:20.859 --> 00:27:23.649
TRAVIS: I'm going to move. Can I move towards you
a little bit?

00:27:23.649 --> 00:27:24.474
MATT: This way, there?

00:27:24.474 --> 00:27:28.009
TRAVIS: Yes, staying next to him, but just out of
the way of other projectiles that might be coming

00:27:28.009 --> 00:27:29.507
up my butthole.

00:27:29.507 --> 00:27:33.431
MATT: Fair enough. (laughs) Okay, Grog. Ends your
turn. Keyleth, you're up.

00:27:33.431 --> 00:27:38.952
MARISHA: Okay. I'm right next to Trinket, right?

00:27:38.952 --> 00:27:40.545
MATT: Mm-hm.

00:27:40.545 --> 00:27:42.206
MARISHA: Okay, right? Where is Trinket?

00:27:42.206 --> 00:27:43.808
MATT: Trinket's right there. You're over here.

00:27:43.808 --> 00:27:45.194
LIAM: Follow the smell.

00:27:45.194 --> 00:27:46.743
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and go to Trinket.

00:27:46.743 --> 00:27:48.811
LAURA: (laughs)

00:27:48.811 --> 00:27:50.103
MATT: Oh, that's right. Make a death saving throw,
by the way.

00:27:50.103 --> 00:27:51.224
SAM: Oh, snap.

00:27:51.224 --> 00:27:52.042
MATT: Almost forgot.

00:27:52.042 --> 00:27:53.085
LAURA: (whimpers) Oh no.

00:27:53.085 --> 00:27:54.017
MATT: Roll a d20.

00:27:54.017 --> 00:27:55.502
LIAM: (sings) Roll high.

00:27:55.502 --> 00:27:56.988
MARISHA: He'll be fine. He'll be fine.

00:27:56.988 --> 00:27:58.138
TALIESIN: Roll like your bear depends on it.

00:27:58.138 --> 00:27:59.440
TRAVIS: You should pick a blood-colored one.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.040
LAURA: Why would you do that? He rolled a 19.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:01.841
SAM: Ooh.

00:28:01.841 --> 00:28:03.924
MATT: Okay, so not creeping closer to death yet.

00:28:03.924 --> 00:28:04.970
LAURA: Don't say that.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:09.518
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to go ahead and do a Cure
Wounds spell on him.

00:28:09.518 --> 00:28:10.877
MATT: All right.

00:28:10.877 --> 00:28:12.291
LAURA: Thank you, Keyleth.

00:28:12.291 --> 00:28:13.839
MARISHA: I'll just do first level.

00:28:13.839 --> 00:28:16.117
SAM: Oh. Trinket's not worth second level?

00:28:16.117 --> 00:28:18.167
MARISHA: No no no no no. I'll give him a-- shut
up, Scanlan.

00:28:18.167 --> 00:28:19.154
(all laugh)

00:28:19.154 --> 00:28:20.901
LIAM: Wake him up, wake him up, wake him up.

00:28:20.901 --> 00:28:22.738
MARISHA: I instantly felt guilty, dick.

00:28:22.738 --> 00:28:24.101
TALIESIN: You guilted her up to another level.

00:28:24.101 --> 00:28:25.547
MARISHA: Yeah, you did. Okay.

00:28:25.547 --> 00:28:29.374
TRAVIS: (laughs) That was the best.

00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:30.518
SAM: I would've done a cantrip.

00:28:30.518 --> 00:28:32.055
MARISHA: (laughs) That's 2d8 plus ten.

00:28:32.055 --> 00:28:32.995
TRAVIS: Dick.

00:28:32.995 --> 00:28:34.107
LAURA: 2d8 plus ten? That's great.

00:28:34.107 --> 00:28:35.408
(all laugh)

00:28:35.408 --> 00:28:36.785
TRAVIS: Guilted it for an imaginary bear.

00:28:36.785 --> 00:28:37.583
MARISHA: All right, that's pretty good.

00:28:37.583 --> 00:28:38.445
TALIESIN: That's not bad.

00:28:38.445 --> 00:28:41.292
MARISHA: That's an eight and a seven plus ten.
So--

00:28:41.292 --> 00:28:42.132
MATT and SAM: 25.

00:28:42.132 --> 00:28:42.858
MARISHA: 25.

00:28:42.858 --> 00:28:43.432
LAURA: 25!

00:28:43.432 --> 00:28:44.525
MATT: So Trinket's at 25 hit points, conscious.

00:28:44.525 --> 00:28:45.371
LAURA: That's great!

00:28:45.371 --> 00:28:47.453
MATT: Prone, but conscious.

00:28:47.453 --> 00:28:48.696
LAURA: He licks her.

00:28:48.696 --> 00:28:50.405
MATT: You hear the-- okay. (laughs)

00:28:50.405 --> 00:28:51.973
MARISHA: And then, as a bonus action--

00:28:51.973 --> 00:28:52.883
TALIESIN: Ack.

00:28:52.883 --> 00:28:53.698
MATT: Mm-hm?

00:28:53.698 --> 00:28:58.601
MARISHA: Can I, looking at whatever the shit this
is, pull out my spark stone--

00:28:58.601 --> 00:28:59.706
LAURA: (gasps)

00:28:59.706 --> 00:29:01.365
MARISHA: --that I got from my Fire Ashari.

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:02.600
SAM: That's a thing? Oooh.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.670
MATT: Uh-huh.

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:04.743
MARISHA: And (shattering sound).

00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:05.517
SAM: (gasps)

00:29:05.517 --> 00:29:07.133
TALIESIN: Oh, wow! We're going there.

00:29:07.133 --> 00:29:07.910
MATT: Okay.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.821
SAM: Is that, like, "Break glass in case of
emergency"?

00:29:09.821 --> 00:29:11.306
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't know what it does.

00:29:11.306 --> 00:29:12.264
SAM: (laughs) Oh, great!

00:29:12.264 --> 00:29:13.006
TRAVIS: We'll find out.

00:29:13.006 --> 00:29:14.436
SAM: Hope I'm right next to you.

00:29:14.436 --> 00:29:16.183
MATT: After you finish healing Trinket--

00:29:16.183 --> 00:29:16.975
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:29:16.975 --> 00:29:19.572
MATT: -- you pull up, reach out, and pull this.
And you're going to hold it in your hands, you

00:29:19.572 --> 00:29:23.315
could feel it's warm to the touch. Almost too hot
to hold. And there's this slight pulsing, almost

00:29:23.315 --> 00:29:28.081
like a heartbeat pulse to it. You hold it in your
hands and just crush it, concentrating all your

00:29:28.081 --> 00:29:31.612
energy on it. As you do, what seemed to be hard
and sturdy all of a sudden turns brittle in your

00:29:31.612 --> 00:29:36.992
fingers, and it cracks and breaks, almost like it
was made of a very, very brittle earth. As it

00:29:36.992 --> 00:29:42.385
breaks and your hands come together, the "too hot
to touch" becomes too hot to touch, and for a

00:29:42.385 --> 00:29:44.115
moment, your hands burst into flames--

00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:44.917
SAM: Ah.

00:29:44.917 --> 00:29:47.498
MATT: And you instinctively pull back like you
want to go ahead and put out the fire--

00:29:47.498 --> 00:29:48.853
MARISHA: Ow!

00:29:48.853 --> 00:29:52.518
MATT: -- but then it falls to a normal temperature
again, but the flames remain.

00:29:52.518 --> 00:29:53.468
LAURA: (gasps)

00:29:53.468 --> 00:29:56.406
MATT: And you can now see your hands are now
emitting flame from all the fingers.

00:29:56.406 --> 00:29:57.070
SAM: Woo.

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:57.834
LAURA: Is that permanent?

00:29:57.834 --> 00:29:59.160
SAM: What does it do?

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.361
MARISHA: We'll find out. And I go Minxie.

00:30:01.361 --> 00:30:02.504
MATT: All right.

00:30:02.504 --> 00:30:03.487
TRAVIS: Yeah, Minxie!

00:30:03.487 --> 00:30:04.847
(all cheer)

00:30:04.847 --> 00:30:05.832
MARISHA: And I brought the hood.

00:30:05.832 --> 00:30:09.220
(all laugh)

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.281
SAM: Too hot to handle, too cold to hold.

00:30:12.281 --> 00:30:13.467
LIAM: That tiger's on fire!

00:30:13.467 --> 00:30:14.644
TRAVIS: They in control.

00:30:14.644 --> 00:30:16.472
MATT: Keyleth transforms into Minxie! And as
Minxie--

00:30:16.472 --> 00:30:17.528
TRAVIS: Bobby Brown.

00:30:17.528 --> 00:30:22.988
MATT: -- appears, her form transitioning into this
large, albino sabre-toothed tiger--

00:30:22.988 --> 00:30:25.232
SAM and TALIESIN: (sing) Well, I guess we're gonna
have to take control.

00:30:25.232 --> 00:30:28.397
MATT: You can see both of the tiger's claws
embedded into the ground of this rocky terrain are

00:30:28.397 --> 00:30:33.085
having licks of fire and flame curling off of the
actual claws.

00:30:33.085 --> 00:30:35.331
MARISHA: Hell, yeah. I look like an Ed Hardy
tattoo.

00:30:35.331 --> 00:30:37.657
(all laugh)

00:30:37.657 --> 00:30:39.784
MATT: (laughs) I regret everything!

00:30:39.784 --> 00:30:43.325
(all laugh)

00:30:43.325 --> 00:30:47.386
MATT: All right. That's your turn. Are you going
to move, are you going to stay there?

00:30:47.386 --> 00:30:48.938
MARISHA: Well, I moved to Trinket.

00:30:48.938 --> 00:30:51.271
MATT: Right, but you can break your movement up.

00:30:51.271 --> 00:30:52.333
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

00:30:52.333 --> 00:30:55.077
MATT: You've moved 20 feet, so you still have ten
more feet to move if you want to.

00:30:55.077 --> 00:30:59.326
MARISHA: I'll start heading to try and flank him.
To flank the blue beastie.

00:30:59.326 --> 00:31:07.237
MATT: That should be there. Okay. All right, that
ends Keyleth. Now would be Tiberius. Tiberius, who

00:31:07.237 --> 00:31:16.256
now takes the turn to cast Stoneskin on himself.
Then backs up behind this side, there, preparing

00:31:16.256 --> 00:31:19.514
for the next round. Vax, you're up.

00:31:19.514 --> 00:31:24.735
LIAM: Okay, Vax drops low. I click the boots of
haste together, and for everyone who keeps asking,

00:31:24.735 --> 00:31:28.967
if I click my boots of haste together, I then get
to attack three times. I get that question about

00:31:28.967 --> 00:31:33.392
three times a week. So that's how I do it. So, I
click the boots of haste together, and then I'm

00:31:33.392 --> 00:31:43.572
going to crouch low and scoot. No, the other side
of Minxie, and I should be able to go 60 feet

00:31:43.572 --> 00:31:47.636
without a problem all the way past the fucker.

00:31:47.636 --> 00:31:48.579
MATT: Mm-hm?

00:31:48.579 --> 00:31:51.367
LIAM: Yeah, keep going, as far as I can. That's as
far as I can go?

00:31:51.367 --> 00:31:52.373
MATT: Yep.

00:31:52.373 --> 00:31:59.421
LIAM: All right. And I guess I will just dagger
him in the ass, then.

00:31:59.421 --> 00:32:00.308
MATT: All right.

00:32:00.308 --> 00:32:05.364
LIAM: So-- First is a--

00:32:05.364 --> 00:32:07.249
TALIESIN: I love that die.

00:32:07.249 --> 00:32:09.275
LIAM: Two, three, 24?

00:32:09.275 --> 00:32:10.108
MATT: 24 hits.

00:32:10.108 --> 00:32:12.079
LIAM: Yes. And this would be Sneak Attack--

00:32:12.079 --> 00:32:13.226
MATT: This is with Sneak Attack, yep.

00:32:13.226 --> 00:32:14.248
LIAM: Because he's with Grog.

00:32:14.248 --> 00:32:15.006
MATT: Yep.

00:32:15.006 --> 00:32:15.861
LAURA: Yeah!

00:32:15.861 --> 00:32:23.631
LIAM: So, here's the damage for the attack. Ooh.
Two, seven, is nine, plus-- Ooh.

00:32:23.631 --> 00:32:25.320
LAURA: Ooh, oh no.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:30.940
LIAM: This is 13, 17, 19, 20, 26, 31 for the
first.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:31.972
TRAVIS: Jesus.

00:32:31.972 --> 00:32:40.072
LIAM: Second attack go. Oh, that's not the right
die at all. Second attack goes. Same. Eee, 23?

00:32:40.072 --> 00:32:41.751
MATT: All right, that hits.

00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:43.469
LIAM: Okay. And this is--

00:32:43.469 --> 00:32:44.798
MATT: Regular damage now.

00:32:44.798 --> 00:32:47.018
LIAM: Yeah yeah yeah. That's seven?

00:32:47.018 --> 00:32:48.223
MATT: Seven, all righty.

00:32:48.223 --> 00:32:52.090
LIAM: And then the last dagger, the keen dagger,
stabs him in the butt again, and that is--

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:53.157
LAURA: Ow.

00:32:53.157 --> 00:32:54.455
LIAM: Ow, 16.

00:32:54.455 --> 00:32:56.375
MATT: 16. That does not hit.

00:32:56.375 --> 00:32:57.430
LIAM: Whiff!

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:00.964
MATT: You actually go with a third one. The first
one stabs through, and you can see you've actually

00:33:00.964 --> 00:33:06.049
hit some sort of an internal organ as you pull
back and starts gouting blood. You see that, you

00:33:06.049 --> 00:33:09.657
stab a second blade in the same area and tend to
open the wound another inch, inch and a half. The

00:33:09.657 --> 00:33:14.644
third one, you pull back, but it slinks around
over its shoulder, its long sinewy neck curling

00:33:14.644 --> 00:33:18.759
over and staring at you. And your blade catches
the hide instead and streaks off of the scales.

00:33:18.759 --> 00:33:20.260
LIAM: Oh, hi.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.866
MATT: That'll end your turn. Scanlan, you're up.

00:33:22.866 --> 00:33:24.524
SAM: Do I have to heal Trinket anymore?

00:33:24.524 --> 00:33:25.956
LAURA: No, he's okay.

00:33:25.956 --> 00:33:35.675
SAM: Okay. Then I will-- (laughs) Let's see here.
Do we want to get him away from us, or do we want

00:33:35.675 --> 00:33:37.697
to hurt him? Let's do--

00:33:37.697 --> 00:33:39.142
LAURA: We want to hurt him!

00:33:39.142 --> 00:33:41.881
SAM: Well, I don't hurt things very well.
(laughs)

00:33:41.881 --> 00:33:42.888
TRAVIS: Do what you're going to do.

00:33:42.888 --> 00:33:43.790
LAURA: Do what you do.

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:44.909
TALIESIN: You hurt feelings.

00:33:44.909 --> 00:33:46.355
MARISHA: You do you, Scanlan.

00:33:46.355 --> 00:33:51.031
SAM: Okay. I'll do some Bigby Hand.

00:33:51.031 --> 00:33:52.262
MATT: All righty.

00:33:52.262 --> 00:33:56.075
SAM: I summon Bigby's Hand. (sings) Bigby's Hand!

00:33:56.075 --> 00:33:57.695
(all laugh)

00:33:57.695 --> 00:34:02.454
MATT: This giant spectral hand, sparkling arcane
energy appears roughly in front of your space.

00:34:02.454 --> 00:34:05.164
SAM: It's in front of me. I can't make it go in
front of him?

00:34:05.164 --> 00:34:05.835
MATT: You can.

00:34:05.835 --> 00:34:06.548
SAM: Okay.

00:34:06.548 --> 00:34:08.251
MATT: Like, I'm just saying, from a flavor
standpoint.

00:34:08.251 --> 00:34:12.269
SAM: Okay. Well then, I do one of these, the Sugar
Ray Leonard. I do this--

00:34:12.269 --> 00:34:13.639
(all laugh)

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:15.309
SAM: And then I throw my other hand forward.

00:34:15.309 --> 00:34:16.675
(all laugh)

00:34:16.675 --> 00:34:19.276
SAM: And I'll just punch him in the face.

00:34:19.276 --> 00:34:20.060
MATT: Go for it.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:21.099
(all laugh)

00:34:21.099 --> 00:34:22.000
MATT: I like that.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.752
SAM: Right? Because I can do the-- It says huge or
smaller creature, at least with Grasping Hand. Is

00:34:26.752 --> 00:34:28.231
that only-- does that count?

00:34:28.231 --> 00:34:32.512
MATT: Right. Oh. You can just punch something with
it, no matter its size, to do damage.

00:34:32.512 --> 00:34:34.624
SAM: So the Clenched Fisht, Clenched Fist.

00:34:34.624 --> 00:34:35.658
MATT: Correct. Correct.

00:34:35.658 --> 00:34:36.567
LAURA: Clenched Fisht.

00:34:36.567 --> 00:34:37.470
MATT: Clenched Fisht.

00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:38.452
SAM: Clenched Fisht attack, Money Penny.

00:34:38.452 --> 00:34:40.495
MATT: Thish ish the one you're talking about. Yes.
All right, so--

00:34:41.444 --> 00:34:46.184
For the Clenched Fist, make a melee spell
attack. So roll a d20 and add your spell attack

00:34:46.237 --> 00:34:47.614
modifier.

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:51.186
SAM: (laughs) Nope.

00:34:51.186 --> 00:34:52.334
(all laugh)

00:34:52.334 --> 00:34:53.457
LAURA: Oh no.

00:34:53.457 --> 00:34:54.448
SAM: 13.

00:34:54.448 --> 00:35:00.134
MATT: 13. As the fist swings out, it ducks out of
the way. Its serpentine body ducking as the fist

00:35:00.134 --> 00:35:02.870
arcs off into the middle of the air.

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:03.661
MARISHA: Oh.

00:35:03.661 --> 00:35:05.387
MATT: Spinning around, preparing itself for a
secondary round, hopefully.

00:35:05.387 --> 00:35:06.734
LAURA: Good try, Scanlan.

00:35:06.734 --> 00:35:07.977
SAM: Oh boy. (laughs)

00:35:07.977 --> 00:35:08.872
MATT: That's good.

00:35:08.872 --> 00:35:10.842
LIAM: Vax sees it fly over his head, and watches
it pass.

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:12.770
(all laugh)

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:18.399
SAM: I'll take a step to my left, so I'm not in
the same line of fire as Percy.

00:35:18.399 --> 00:35:19.612
MATT: All right.

00:35:19.612 --> 00:35:27.831
SAM: And I'll also inspire Grog. (sings) He's
Grog, he's Grog, he's big, he's strong, like wood.

00:35:27.831 --> 00:35:29.824
He's better than bad, he's good.

00:35:29.824 --> 00:35:33.415
(all laugh)

00:35:33.415 --> 00:35:34.394
LAURA: That's awesome.

00:35:34.394 --> 00:35:35.892
MATT: (sings) Everyone wants a Grog.

00:35:35.892 --> 00:35:37.126
TRAVIS: That's amazing. Is that a ten? That's a
ten?

00:35:37.126 --> 00:35:37.964
MATT: d10, yeah.

00:35:37.964 --> 00:35:38.583
TRAVIS: Amazing.

00:35:38.583 --> 00:35:40.126
MATT: d10 Inspiration die from the bard.

00:35:40.126 --> 00:35:41.121
TRAVIS: Thank you, Scanlan.

00:35:41.121 --> 00:35:43.126
MATT: Top of the round again. Percy, you're up.

00:35:43.126 --> 00:35:50.931
TALIESIN: I'm going to scoot a little bit forward,
just into that little crevice. I'm going to take

00:35:50.931 --> 00:35:54.392
three more shots, just to see what I can do.

00:35:54.392 --> 00:35:57.024
MATT: Okay. You have the Sharpshooter feat,
right?

00:35:57.024 --> 00:35:58.401
TALIESIN: With the Sharpshooter feat.

00:35:58.401 --> 00:36:00.730
MATT: Okay, so yeah. Because it would have partial
cover right now, but you ignore that with the--

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:02.250
TALIESIN: I have Sharpshooter, so I can ignore
cover.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:03.656
MATT: Good to know.

00:36:03.656 --> 00:36:09.496
TALIESIN: Yeah, so. But I'm going to be taking a
negative for these hits. Still three attacks per--

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:10.982
MATT: Yeah.

00:36:10.982 --> 00:36:12.777
TALIESIN: Okay. Just making sure I'm doing this
right.

00:36:12.777 --> 00:36:14.184
MATT: But you have to reload after this turn.

00:36:14.184 --> 00:36:16.586
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:36:19.701 --> 00:36:20.712
MATT: Oh no.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:21.974
TRAVIS: Misfire?

00:36:21.974 --> 00:36:22.792
TALIESIN: Misfire.

00:36:22.792 --> 00:36:23.463
(all groan)

00:36:23.463 --> 00:36:25.666
MATT: First shot. As you pull up to the side, you
pull your pepperbox out and go to fire. As you do,

00:36:25.666 --> 00:36:31.121
you pull the trigger and the actual barrel sticks
out the side. Spins off, and

00:36:31.121 --> 00:36:32.874
(ping-ping-ping) on the ground.

00:36:32.874 --> 00:36:34.587
TRAVIS: Fuck.

00:36:35.046 --> 00:36:37.804
MATT: So that's your attack.

00:36:38.664 --> 00:36:39.737
MARISHA: Balls.

00:36:40.029 --> 00:36:41.769
MATT: That's your turn because it'll take you the
rest of the turn to collect the Bad News.

00:36:41.769 --> 00:36:43.361
SAM: Just say, "Your soul is forfeit," just for
coolness.

00:36:43.361 --> 00:36:45.529
(all laugh)

00:36:45.529 --> 00:36:47.735
TALIESIN: This normally doesn't happen to me. I
don't quite know what--

00:36:47.735 --> 00:36:49.109
(all laugh)

00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:50.714
TRAVIS: It happens to all guys sometimes.

00:36:50.714 --> 00:36:52.367
(all laugh)

00:36:52.367 --> 00:36:55.301
TALIESIN: So can I, at least, use my bonus to pick
up the pieces and--

00:36:55.301 --> 00:36:56.151
MATT: Yeah.

00:36:56.151 --> 00:36:57.064
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to pick up the pieces
and--

00:36:57.064 --> 00:36:59.252
MATT: You collect Pepperbox and you pull your back
up to it and mutter curses.

00:36:59.252 --> 00:37:00.036
LAURA: Oh no.

00:37:00.036 --> 00:37:01.138
LIAM: Make sure you grab your dignity as well.

00:37:01.138 --> 00:37:04.127
TALIESIN: I'm just going to leave that as an open
target for a little while.

00:37:04.127 --> 00:37:07.858
MATT: Fair enough. Okay. Now, on its turn--

00:37:07.858 --> 00:37:08.662
SAM: Oh shit.

00:37:08.662 --> 00:37:09.560
LAURA: Oh no.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.681
MATT: First off, let's see here.

00:37:11.681 --> 00:37:12.709
LIAM: Damn it, attack attack!

00:37:12.709 --> 00:37:14.266
SAM: We did great. (laughs)

00:37:14.266 --> 00:37:19.689
MATT: But that does not recharge its Lightning
Breath. It's going to move here. It's going to go

00:37:19.689 --> 00:37:27.123
ahead and make two attacks. It's going to turn
around and its head that's looking at you, now,

00:37:27.123 --> 00:37:28.225
after you stabbed it in the back.

00:37:28.225 --> 00:37:29.050
LIAM: Yeah.

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:33.209
MATT: Reaches down, its giant jaws open. You can
see, like, this thick saliva that's coating its

00:37:33.209 --> 00:37:37.324
fangs, and it, with serpentine speed, bites at
you.

00:37:37.324 --> 00:37:39.369
LIAM: Hey, rogue's Evasion.

00:37:39.369 --> 00:37:43.411
MATT: That's going to be a 23 to hit.

00:37:43.411 --> 00:37:48.091
LIAM: So, Uncanny Dodge, I can dodge for half
damage, so it was a what to hit?

00:37:48.091 --> 00:37:48.924
MATT: 23.

00:37:48.924 --> 00:37:50.495
LIAM: 23 hits, but I take half damage.

00:37:50.495 --> 00:37:51.364
MATT: All right.

00:37:51.364 --> 00:37:52.393
LAURA: (as Vax) Half damage.

00:37:52.393 --> 00:37:53.699
MATT: So, let's see. That would be--

00:37:53.699 --> 00:37:54.748
LIAM: Yesh.

00:37:54.748 --> 00:37:55.624
MARISHA: Does a bite attack--

00:37:55.624 --> 00:37:58.746
LIAM: Half. Not whole.

00:37:58.746 --> 00:38:00.217
LAURA: (as Vax) Half damage.

00:38:00.217 --> 00:38:02.190
LIAM: 152 hit points.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:03.389
TRAVIS: Stop rolling, Jesus.

00:38:03.389 --> 00:38:07.400
MATT: (laughs) It would be 26 damage, so you take
13.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.616
LIAM: Ah, nothing.

00:38:08.616 --> 00:38:09.506
LAURA: Okay, okay.

00:38:09.506 --> 00:38:10.415
TALIESIN: Ain't nothing.

00:38:10.415 --> 00:38:11.264
LAURA: Don't say that's nothing.

00:38:11.264 --> 00:38:12.484
MATT: Points of piercing damage.

00:38:12.484 --> 00:38:13.396
LAURA: Don't say that's nothing.

00:38:13.396 --> 00:38:18.451
MATT: And then, as it bites, it turns around and
its tail begins to snake around your body, Grog.

00:38:18.451 --> 00:38:19.298
LAURA: (gasps)

00:38:19.298 --> 00:38:21.818
MATT: And its whole body begins to try to reach
around to constrict and crush you.

00:38:21.818 --> 00:38:22.651
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

00:38:22.651 --> 00:38:23.456
LAURA: What?

00:38:23.456 --> 00:38:25.109
MATT: That is a 21 to hit.

00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:26.357
TRAVIS: That hits.

00:38:26.357 --> 00:38:35.248
MATT: All righty, so. You take 21 points in
bludgeoning damage.

00:38:35.248 --> 00:38:36.757
TRAVIS: Halved.

00:38:36.757 --> 00:38:46.182
MATT: So that'd be 11 points of bludgeoning damage
plus 21 points of slashing damage.

00:38:46.387 --> 00:38:47.136
SAM: Whoa.

00:38:47.136 --> 00:38:48.179
TRAVIS: Halved.

00:38:48.179 --> 00:38:49.637
MATT: As well. So a total of 22 damage.

00:38:49.637 --> 00:38:51.125
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:38:51.125 --> 00:38:54.417
MATT: And you are considered grappled and
restrained, currently, as the entire creature

00:38:54.417 --> 00:38:58.083
begins to wrap around you. And you're currently
(sound of struggle). You're trying to hold onto

00:38:58.083 --> 00:39:01.319
your axe but your whole body's being crushed by
this large serpentine creature.

00:39:01.319 --> 00:39:02.616
(all laugh)

00:39:02.616 --> 00:39:04.174
TRAVIS: You piece of shit.

00:39:04.174 --> 00:39:08.378
MATT: You feel every pulse of its muscles tensing.
As the pain and ache, you can feel muscles and

00:39:08.378 --> 00:39:11.604
ligaments tearing and popping as it pulls in on
you.

00:39:11.604 --> 00:39:12.576
TRAVIS: Not cool.

00:39:12.576 --> 00:39:25.708
MATT: And it's going to, as part of its grapple,
move you with it to there. And it'll end its turn.

00:39:25.708 --> 00:39:27.320
Vex, you're up.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:32.754
LAURA: Okay. How does the Hide thing work? Do I
hide at the beginning of the turn or

00:39:32.754 --> 00:39:34.167
at the end of the turn?

00:39:34.167 --> 00:39:35.148
MATT: At the end of the turn.

00:39:35.148 --> 00:39:36.632
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to move out.

00:39:36.632 --> 00:39:41.860
MATT: Okay, it has a reach of ten. So you are
technically within its melee range. So you can run

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:45.587
but you'll take attack of opportunity from it if
you do. Just so you're aware.

00:39:45.587 --> 00:39:47.409
LAURA: Can I still arrow it from where I am?

00:39:47.409 --> 00:39:51.078
MATT: You can, but you have disadvantage on all
your ranged attacks because

00:39:51.078 --> 00:39:52.342
you are in melee range.

00:39:52.342 --> 00:39:54.683
LAURA: Does it cancel out because I'm in the
mountains?

00:39:54.683 --> 00:39:55.581
MATT: Doesn't affect your attacks.

00:39:55.581 --> 00:39:56.384
LAURA: Damn it.

00:39:56.384 --> 00:39:59.876
MATT: Sorry. It's up to you, you can stay where
you are and take disadvantage on all your attacks,

00:39:59.876 --> 00:40:04.481
or you could run past and it gets a free swipe on
you. Your call.

00:40:04.481 --> 00:40:07.343
LAURA: I'm going to try to back up.

00:40:07.343 --> 00:40:09.914
MATT: Okay. Over to here? Like, how far?

00:40:09.914 --> 00:40:13.862
LAURA: Oh no. Wait, I can't see. I forgot my
glasses.

00:40:13.862 --> 00:40:14.969
MATT: Okay, you're right here.

00:40:14.969 --> 00:40:15.915
LAURA: Uh-huh.

00:40:15.915 --> 00:40:18.187
MATT: You can try and back up this way if you
wanted to get away.

00:40:18.187 --> 00:40:20.595
LAURA: Yeah, I'll try to back up towards, who is
that?

00:40:20.595 --> 00:40:22.463
MATT: That's Scanlan there. Oh, here?

00:40:22.463 --> 00:40:23.860
LAURA: Percy? I'll try to back towards Percy.

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:24.553
MATT: Right there?

00:40:24.553 --> 00:40:25.280
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:25.812
MATT: Over here?

00:40:25.812 --> 00:40:26.940
LAURA: Sure, yeah. Why not?

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:27.731
MATT: Okay, all right.

00:40:27.731 --> 00:40:28.526
SAM: What's Trinket doing?

00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:30.185
LAURA: Well, Trinket's healed, and he's going to
come with me.

00:40:30.185 --> 00:40:33.829
MATT: Okay. So Trinket gets up and used half its
40 movement. It can move--

00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:36.122
LAURA: Although he's angry about it, because he
wants to fight, but I just won't

00:40:36.122 --> 00:40:37.275
let him right now.

00:40:37.275 --> 00:40:42.872
MATT: Okay, so as you rush away, the creature
takes-- Ooh, that's a 26 to hit.

00:40:42.872 --> 00:40:44.549
LAURA: Aw, Jesus. Really?

00:40:44.549 --> 00:40:45.788
SAM: Oh shit, does it hit Trinket, too?

00:40:45.788 --> 00:40:46.580
LAURA: No, just me.

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:47.348
MARISHA: 26.

00:40:47.348 --> 00:40:48.530
LAURA: Trinket was too far away.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:41:01.446
MATT: So you take 18 points of piercing damage.
Oh, it's 3d10, sorry.

00:41:01.446 --> 00:41:02.988
LAURA: Oh. (laughs)

00:41:02.988 --> 00:41:04.124
MATT: 19. I rolled a one for damage.

00:41:04.124 --> 00:41:05.085
LAURA: Oh, yay!

00:41:05.085 --> 00:41:08.379
MATT: 19 points of piercing damage as its mouth
lashes out, takes a chunk of your shoulder for a

00:41:08.379 --> 00:41:10.829
second, and you wrench yourself away and keep
running.

00:41:10.829 --> 00:41:11.649
LAURA: Ugh.

00:41:11.649 --> 00:41:13.128
MATT: Take the rest of your turn.

00:41:13.128 --> 00:41:16.215
LAURA: Ugh, okay. I'm going to shoot him.

00:41:16.215 --> 00:41:17.324
MATT: Yes, you are.

00:41:17.324 --> 00:41:22.121
LAURA: Okay. That is 22.

00:41:22.121 --> 00:41:23.087
MATT: That hits.

00:41:23.087 --> 00:41:33.080
LAURA: Okay. 14 for the first hit.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.568
MATT: Okay.

00:41:34.568 --> 00:41:37.693
LAURA: Second one is through the blazing bow, at
22.

00:41:37.693 --> 00:41:40.851
MATT: Second one hits, first one misses, or did it
hit?

00:41:40.851 --> 00:41:42.115
LAURA: Oh no, 14 was the damage to it.

00:41:42.115 --> 00:41:44.593
MATT: For damage? All right, second one, blazing
bow?

00:41:44.593 --> 00:41:49.634
LAURA: And then, (noises).

00:41:49.634 --> 00:41:50.752
SAM: (noises)

00:41:50.752 --> 00:41:55.746
LAURA: (noises) Ugh. 16.

00:41:55.746 --> 00:41:59.596
MATT: 16 damage, all right. Okay.

00:41:59.596 --> 00:42:01.898
LAURA: Oh, and I hide.

00:42:01.898 --> 00:42:05.201
MATT: You currently are completely in its visual
range. You have to be behind something to

00:42:05.201 --> 00:42:06.889
reasonably become hidden.

00:42:06.889 --> 00:42:07.867
LAURA: I'm hiding behind--

00:42:07.867 --> 00:42:09.287
TALIESIN: But you are behind me.

00:42:09.287 --> 00:42:10.178
LAURA: Percy.

00:42:10.178 --> 00:42:12.328
MATT: No, behind a person doesn't work. It has to
be, like, behind a pillar.

00:42:12.328 --> 00:42:13.424
MARISHA: Human shield.

00:42:13.424 --> 00:42:14.495
MATT: Or in deep shadow.

00:42:14.495 --> 00:42:15.460
LAURA: (groans) Oh.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.765
MATT: Something that would break your line of
sight to it--

00:42:16.765 --> 00:42:17.678
TRAVIS: Like me.

00:42:17.678 --> 00:42:19.630
MATT: For a moment, to the point where it no
longer knows quite where you are.

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:20.487
MARISHA: It works.

00:42:20.487 --> 00:42:21.333
TALIESIN: It totally works.

00:42:21.333 --> 00:42:22.168
LAURA: I hid in the wrong place.

00:42:22.168 --> 00:42:23.079
SAM: Who said that? Who said that?

00:42:23.079 --> 00:42:24.110
LAURA: I went to the wrong place.

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:24.973
MATT: But now you know.

00:42:24.973 --> 00:42:26.184
LAURA: It's okay. Next time I know.

00:42:26.184 --> 00:42:26.981
MATT: All right.

00:42:26.981 --> 00:42:27.798
TALIESIN: Putting glass for the dog--

00:42:27.798 --> 00:42:29.263
MATT: That's your turn. Grog, you're up.

00:42:29.263 --> 00:42:31.070
TRAVIS: I would like to try and break the
grapple.

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:32.060
MATT: All right.

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:32.968
TRAVIS: 20.

00:42:32.968 --> 00:42:33.972
MATT: 20, yes.

00:42:33.972 --> 00:42:35.317
MARISHA: I can picture that. Why did you do that?

00:42:35.317 --> 00:42:36.410
MATT: Because you are restrained--

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:37.497
TALIESIN: Kicking myself.

00:42:37.497 --> 00:42:50.450
MATT: Need to check what effect the condition--
Here. Just to be safe.

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:53.812
Okay, yeah. Go ahead and you're making an
athletics check.

00:42:54.115 --> 00:42:55.070
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:56.759
(all cheer)

00:42:56.759 --> 00:42:57.778
TRAVIS: Oh, that was good.

00:42:57.778 --> 00:42:58.444
MATT: All right, so--

00:42:58.444 --> 00:42:59.560
TRAVIS: I bite its tail.

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:00.262
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:43:00.262 --> 00:43:01.227
(all laugh)

00:43:01.227 --> 00:43:01.992
LAURA: You can.

00:43:01.992 --> 00:43:02.822
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch! Ahhh!

00:43:02.822 --> 00:43:05.506
MATT: As your teeth sink into one of its scales
and you yank it out with the sheer force of your

00:43:05.506 --> 00:43:06.701
muscly neck.

00:43:06.701 --> 00:43:09.233
LAURA: Throw it over my way. I'll catch it.

00:43:09.233 --> 00:43:11.872
MATT: It unfurls for a second, you manage to pull
yourself out of its grasp.

00:43:11.872 --> 00:43:17.395
TRAVIS: I'm so pissed that I broke free, that I
would like to use Intimidating Presence on this

00:43:17.395 --> 00:43:18.587
creature.

00:43:18.587 --> 00:43:23.002
MATT: Okay. All right. That is an action to do
that, though, isn't it?

00:43:23.002 --> 00:43:23.964
TRAVIS: Is it?

00:43:23.964 --> 00:43:24.602
MATT: Yeah.

00:43:24.602 --> 00:43:25.566
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:43:25.566 --> 00:43:27.905
TRAVIS: I reserve Intimidating Presence--

00:43:27.905 --> 00:43:28.756
MATT: For a later time.

00:43:28.756 --> 00:43:30.092
TRAVIS: (laughs) -- for a later time.

00:43:30.092 --> 00:43:31.010
MATT: But you have a bonus action, still.

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:32.035
TRAVIS: I hit the shit out of it.

00:43:32.035 --> 00:43:33.012
(all laugh)

00:43:33.012 --> 00:43:34.234
MATT: You gain another attack, go for it.

00:43:34.234 --> 00:43:35.269
TRAVIS: Okay, 21.

00:43:35.269 --> 00:43:36.294
MATT: 21 does hit.

00:43:36.294 --> 00:43:38.371
TRAVIS: All right, that's 22. 22! Sorry, 22 hits?

00:43:38.371 --> 00:43:39.592
MATT: Also hits. One more.

00:43:39.592 --> 00:43:40.665
TRAVIS: Oh, I get one more.

00:43:40.665 --> 00:43:42.180
LAURA: Ha ha! Also 22.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:42.969
TRAVIS: Also 22.

00:43:42.969 --> 00:43:43.777
MATT: "Hit" meaning--

00:43:43.777 --> 00:43:44.656
SAM: You hit once.

00:43:44.656 --> 00:43:45.754
MATT: It was one better than your previous--

00:43:45.754 --> 00:43:46.568
TRAVIS: Oh, got you.

00:43:46.568 --> 00:43:47.305
MATT: You hit once, yeah.

00:43:47.305 --> 00:43:47.901
LAURA: Oh.

00:43:47.901 --> 00:43:48.543
TRAVIS and MATT: Just one hit.

00:43:48.543 --> 00:43:49.475
SAM: Just keep rolling 22s.

00:43:49.475 --> 00:43:50.238
LAURA: Just keep rolling.

00:43:50.238 --> 00:43:52.102
TRAVIS: Nine, ten, 11, 12. 15.

00:43:52.102 --> 00:43:52.750
MATT: 15 points.

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:54.195
TRAVIS: With fire damage!

00:43:54.195 --> 00:43:58.444
MATT: All right, so, as you pull away, you reach
back with your hammer and slam it into its side,

00:43:58.444 --> 00:44:00.376
causing this giant burst of fire--

00:44:00.376 --> 00:44:01.197
TRAVIS: Bitch.

00:44:01.197 --> 00:44:04.485
MATT: To emanate from the impact. It shrinks back
for a second and (growls).

00:44:04.485 --> 00:44:06.686
TRAVIS: You grabbed me. You ask first.

00:44:06.686 --> 00:44:07.866
TALIESIN: This is a repair die.

00:44:07.866 --> 00:44:09.921
MATT: (laughs) All right, Keyleth, you're up.

00:44:09.921 --> 00:44:11.740
MARISHA: I'm going to do my Bite and Claw
attacks.

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.406
MATT: All right.

00:44:14.377 --> 00:44:18.676
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to move in that crux a
little bit more, one more, if I can?

00:44:18.676 --> 00:44:19.804
MATT: There? All righty.

00:44:19.804 --> 00:44:24.442
MARISHA: Beautiful. I'm going to do my claw
attacks first.

00:44:24.442 --> 00:44:25.333
MATT: Go for it.

00:44:25.333 --> 00:44:27.994
MARISHA: To see what they-- what it does.

00:44:30.428 --> 00:44:32.774
MATT: What was it?

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:33.562
MARISHA: It was cocked.

00:44:33.562 --> 00:44:34.806
SAM: It was halfway between two.

00:44:34.806 --> 00:44:35.643
MATT: Okay.

00:44:35.643 --> 00:44:40.956
MARISHA: So that's 12, plus, it's always
different. Okay, 20.

00:44:40.956 --> 00:44:41.901
MATT: 20 hits.

00:44:41.901 --> 00:44:43.220
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:48.902
MARISHA: I haven't been Minxie in battle for a
while, 1d10 plus five.

00:44:48.902 --> 00:44:50.037
LAURA: Plus your flaming claws.

00:44:50.037 --> 00:44:51.090
TRAVIS: (laughs) I love Minxie.

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:52.470
LAURA: Don't forget your flaming claws.

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:53.414
LIAM: She's got the plan.

00:44:53.414 --> 00:44:55.288
MARISHA: Yeah, six, so 11 damage for the claws.

00:44:55.463 --> 00:44:57.052
MATT: An additional 1d6 fire damage.

00:44:57.052 --> 00:45:01.956
MARISHA: Plus 1d6, oh wait that's actually-- What
did I just say? I said ten, 11?

00:45:01.956 --> 00:45:03.689
And then an extra 1d6?

00:45:03.689 --> 00:45:05.371
MATT: Yes.

00:45:05.371 --> 00:45:07.845
MARISHA: Ooh, another four, so what did I say?

00:45:07.845 --> 00:45:08.568
SAM: 15.

00:45:08.568 --> 00:45:15.475
MATT: So, any of your claw attacks or any claw
attacks you do in any of your forms now get an

00:45:15.653 --> 00:45:17.020
additional 1d6 fire damage.

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:18.102
SAM: Nice!

00:45:18.102 --> 00:45:19.095
TRAVIS: Hell yeah!

00:45:19.095 --> 00:45:19.927
SAM: Nice!

00:45:19.927 --> 00:45:22.030
MARISHA: Then I'm going to do my bite attack.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:24.704
MATT: All right, go for it. Your bite does not get
the effect.

00:45:24.704 --> 00:45:25.894
LAURA: I know, it was really loud!

00:45:25.894 --> 00:45:26.936
TRAVIS: It was a good one.

00:45:26.936 --> 00:45:35.177
MARISHA: 16, so plus-- 20, plus my six, plus
seven, so 24.

00:45:35.177 --> 00:45:37.711
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage for the
bite.

00:45:37.711 --> 00:45:40.217
MARISHA: Which is 2d6.

00:45:40.217 --> 00:45:44.984
Eight plus five, so 12.

00:45:45.201 --> 00:45:46.798
MATT: Eight plus five is 13.

00:45:46.798 --> 00:45:51.417
MARISHA: 13, 14! Plus, I get an extra damage for
my collar, so 14.

00:45:51.417 --> 00:45:57.473
MATT: Right. Cool. So, your flaming claw strikes
across its outer body, its legs pull away from the

00:45:57.473 --> 00:46:02.028
pain as you reach up and bite into the edge of its
tail. As its tail tries to whip away, you catch

00:46:02.096 --> 00:46:06.337
it and it pulls you forward a few feet as you
clench down on it. Eventually, it yanks its way

00:46:06.337 --> 00:46:09.214
out, taking a couple of scales with it, you can
see a streak where teeth marks are

00:46:09.214 --> 00:46:10.499
on the back of its tail.

00:46:10.499 --> 00:46:11.786
MARISHA: (growls)

00:46:11.786 --> 00:46:13.249
MATT: Awesome. Does that end your turn?

00:46:13.249 --> 00:46:14.110
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:15.198
TRAVIS: Nice, Minxie!

00:46:15.198 --> 00:46:16.676
MARISHA: (growls)

00:46:16.676 --> 00:46:21.339
MATT: Tiberius is going to go around the corner
again and is going to cast Telekinesis and send

00:46:21.339 --> 00:46:22.961
his glaive up spinning.

00:46:22.961 --> 00:46:25.000
LAURA: Glaive?

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.745
SAM: He has a glaive?

00:46:26.745 --> 00:46:28.916
LAURA: The thing that he killed the old lady
with.

00:46:28.916 --> 00:46:29.893
SAM: Oh!

00:46:29.893 --> 00:46:30.947
LIAM: It's the granny grinder!

00:46:30.947 --> 00:46:32.630
MARISHA and MATT: Granny grinder?!

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:33.836
TRAVIS: So bad.

00:46:33.836 --> 00:46:38.826
MATT: Rolls a two, unfortunately, though. Just
streaks off and spins back around and then, while

00:46:38.826 --> 00:46:43.033
it misses the creature and stops, hovering above
his head with a slow spin. Sits there curling his

00:46:43.033 --> 00:46:48.017
fingers, grinning at the creature. And is going to
the use of the rest of this movement to go back

00:46:48.239 --> 00:46:52.890
behind the rock because mama didn't raise no fool.
Vax, you're up.

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:59.343
LIAM: It's preoccupied, so I just leisurely walk
backwards about 30 feet, looking at the same wound

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:00.632
that I started before.

00:47:00.632 --> 00:47:01.497
MATT: This way?

00:47:01.497 --> 00:47:06.392
LIAM: No, back up the chasm here. Even further
away. Yeah! And I'm just going to throw three

00:47:06.392 --> 00:47:12.451
daggers into the wound I already hit, so I'm going
to do that again. I know that hits because it hit

00:47:12.451 --> 00:47:14.884
the last time. That's a 23.

00:47:14.884 --> 00:47:15.903
MATT: That hits!

00:47:15.903 --> 00:47:19.293
LIAM: And that's Sneak Attack because he's
occupied. That's 11 plus--

00:47:19.293 --> 00:47:22.324
LAURA: Ooh, those are good!

00:47:22.324 --> 00:47:30.584
LIAM: 11 plus 17, 21, 26, 29, 34, 39 for the first
dagger.

00:47:30.584 --> 00:47:32.327
SAM: What, that's just the first dagger?!

00:47:32.327 --> 00:47:33.059
LAURA: Yeah!

00:47:33.059 --> 00:47:33.806
MARISHA: Whoa!

00:47:33.806 --> 00:47:34.863
MATT: Sneak Attack, man.

00:47:34.863 --> 00:47:36.789
LIAM: Next one doesn't hit, probably, that's a
17.

00:47:36.789 --> 00:47:38.324
MATT: 17 just barely hits.

00:47:38.324 --> 00:47:48.953
LIAM: Just barely hits, yeah! That is an eight of
damage. And just wait a second and go-- and throw

00:47:48.953 --> 00:47:53.853
it. And because I was such a cock it misses,
that's a 16.

00:47:53.853 --> 00:48:01.358
MATT: So, oh, perfect! Second dagger wedges in with
the second dagger, opening the wound even more.

00:48:01.358 --> 00:48:04.907
You're like, perfect opening! You go for the third
one, and it's grown wise to it, and turns around

00:48:04.907 --> 00:48:08.747
and rakes its claw out and deflects the dagger
midair.

00:48:08.747 --> 00:48:11.447
LIAM: Vex, look at me! Oh, shit.

00:48:11.447 --> 00:48:15.136
LAURA: Nice one! Nice!

00:48:15.136 --> 00:48:18.954
MATT: That brings us to Scanlan.

00:48:18.954 --> 00:48:21.504
SAM: Oh! This is unusual.

00:48:21.504 --> 00:48:25.261
MARISHA: A turn.

00:48:25.261 --> 00:48:33.029
SAM: I still have my Bigby's Hand up, so I do one
of these where I say, oh, a wise guy, see?

00:48:33.029 --> 00:48:38.439
(taunting noises) and I just poke him in the
eyes.

00:48:38.439 --> 00:48:44.181
MATT: All right, as you say "Wise guy, eh?" as
this giant hand's floating in the air, and its

00:48:44.181 --> 00:48:48.079
head snarls at it and tries to bite at the hand.
Go ahead and roll your spell attack.

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:52.490
SAM: 19.

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:56.317
MATT: So, you get to go ahead and--

00:48:56.317 --> 00:48:57.237
SAM: 4d8.

00:48:57.237 --> 00:48:59.931
MATT: Yeah, 4d8 points of force damage.

00:48:59.931 --> 00:49:01.294
MARISHA: It's the eyes!

00:49:01.294 --> 00:49:02.638
LAURA: Into the eyeballs!

00:49:02.638 --> 00:49:06.044
SAM: 19.

00:49:06.044 --> 00:49:11.179
MATT: 19 points of force damage as you jam both
its fingers into the sides of its head. Both of

00:49:11.179 --> 00:49:15.439
its eyes recoil on it, it reaches out and starts
thrashing at the air around as the hand dodges

00:49:15.439 --> 00:49:18.209
around for a minute.

00:49:18.209 --> 00:49:29.445
SAM: I hide behind Trinket, the smell of
smoldering fur in my nose. As a bonus action, I

00:49:29.445 --> 00:49:32.809
will-- who's up next, who's coming soon? Is Percy
next?

00:49:32.809 --> 00:49:33.863
TALIESIN: I'm up next.

00:49:33.863 --> 00:49:40.652
SAM: I'll inspire Percy. Just doing this move--

00:49:40.652 --> 00:49:41.593
MARISHA: Sexy dance.

00:49:41.593 --> 00:49:46.825
SAM: Going, pour some Scanlan on you! When you
need a hand! That's all I've got.

00:49:46.825 --> 00:49:48.440
TALIESIN: Ugh!

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:53.951
SAM: And I get closer. Pour some Scanlan on you!

00:49:53.951 --> 00:50:00.175
MATT: You begrudgingly take 1d10 inspiration dice
from Scanlan.

00:50:00.175 --> 00:50:02.318
TRAVIS: Is the creature blinded from the
pokey-poke?

00:50:02.318 --> 00:50:09.385
MATT: It is not. It is a resilient creature, and
the impact was mainly absorbed by the ocular

00:50:09.385 --> 00:50:11.349
sockets, as opposed to the eyes themselves.

00:50:11.402 --> 00:50:12.862
TRAVIS: Hey, I didn't ask for science. Jesus.

00:50:12.862 --> 00:50:16.508
(all laugh)

00:50:16.508 --> 00:50:20.511
MATT: There's bone around-- never mind. All right.
It ends Scanlan's turn. Percy, you're up.

00:50:20.511 --> 00:50:22.311
TRAVIS: (laughs) Just a little pokey.

00:50:22.311 --> 00:50:25.370
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to try and fix this
broken piece of gosa.

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:27.970
SAM: Do I lose another spell for that, or is that
just the same--?

00:50:28.023 --> 00:50:29.543
MATT: No, you can maintain concentration.

00:50:29.543 --> 00:50:31.152
SAM: Okay.

00:50:31.152 --> 00:50:36.095
TALIESIN: I hit a 12, which is just barely enough
to fix it.

00:50:36.095 --> 00:50:39.862
MATT: Okay. So you take your action to go ahead
and repair the gun.

00:50:39.862 --> 00:50:45.887
TALIESIN: And I'm going to burn an Action Surge,
so I'm just-- I finally get it, and it just starts

00:50:45.939 --> 00:50:48.841
going. And I'm just going to empty out the
chamber.

00:50:48.841 --> 00:50:49.856
MATT: All right, three shots.

00:50:49.856 --> 00:50:51.626
MARISHA: (laughs) It just starts going.

00:50:51.626 --> 00:50:52.564
TALIESIN: Ho, nelly.

00:50:52.564 --> 00:50:53.764
MATT: Using your bonus action to reload.

00:50:53.764 --> 00:50:55.313
TRAVIS: I got my finger on the trigger, I got my
finger on the trigger, gun!

00:50:55.313 --> 00:50:57.831
TALIESIN: I don't have to reload, yet, I've got
six shots, so we're still three in the chamber.

00:50:57.831 --> 00:50:59.473
MATT: That's right. We-- yeah, yeah.

00:50:59.473 --> 00:51:00.412
TALIESIN: Unless you, actually--

00:51:00.412 --> 00:51:02.870
MATT: As part of the misfire, you would lose one,
so you have two in the chamber right now.

00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:04.151
TALIESIN: I have two in the chamber?

00:51:04.151 --> 00:51:04.958
MATT: Yes.

00:51:04.958 --> 00:51:06.906
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'll do two, and then use the
third one to reload.

00:51:06.906 --> 00:51:08.440
MATT: Okay.

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.631
MARISHA: Pew, pew.

00:51:09.631 --> 00:51:10.588
LAURA: (high-pitched) Pew, pew.

00:51:10.588 --> 00:51:12.236
TALIESIN: All right, so-- Ooh, this'll be fun.

00:51:12.236 --> 00:51:13.070
SAM: Don't shoot me.

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:16.826
TALIESIN: Sharpshooter shot. That's 22.

00:51:16.826 --> 00:51:17.708
MATT: 22 hits.

00:51:17.708 --> 00:51:18.906
TRAVIS: Nice.

00:51:18.906 --> 00:51:25.566
TALIESIN: I'll just take the second shot right
now. That's-- really? Really?

00:51:25.566 --> 00:51:27.421
Really, are we going there?

00:51:27.421 --> 00:51:28.839
LAURA: Oh, no.

00:51:28.839 --> 00:51:29.974
SAM: Did he misfire again?

00:51:29.974 --> 00:51:30.872
MARISHA: No, you didn't misfire, did you?

00:51:30.872 --> 00:51:31.760
MATT: What'd you roll?

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:32.630
TALIESIN: Misfired again. I rolled a two.

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:33.498
LAURA: No.

00:51:33.498 --> 00:51:34.433
TALIESIN: I got one shot off.

00:51:34.433 --> 00:51:36.330
MATT: You got one shot off. Go ahead and roll
damage. Sharpshooter damage,

00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:37.689
so it gets the plus ten damage.

00:51:37.689 --> 00:51:38.141
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:51:38.141 --> 00:51:39.690
MARISHA: That's fun.

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:41.802
LAURA: Could you have added inspiration dice to
that?

00:51:41.802 --> 00:51:43.629
TALIESIN: To a misfire? No.

00:51:43.629 --> 00:51:48.378
MATT: No, misfire still hits. There is a lot of
strengths to the gunslinger. This is the one

00:51:48.378 --> 00:51:50.104
penalty, is if you roll bad.

00:51:50.104 --> 00:51:54.112
TALIESIN: So that's, okay, at least this is a
badass, as I at least did some damage. 16, 17, 18,

00:51:54.112 --> 00:51:59.304
19, 20, 24 damage, plus four points of fire
damage.

00:51:59.304 --> 00:52:05.393
MATT: Nice. Okay. So, as you go, and you fix it--
It takes the first shot, with a burst of flame

00:52:05.393 --> 00:52:10.344
that shoots out the front of the barrel. The
second shot, this time, the actual metal in the

00:52:10.344 --> 00:52:14.912
front arcs upward, and it looks like this is going
to take a moment, to really seriously repair it.

00:52:14.912 --> 00:52:18.074
Pepperbox is coming through pretty rough in this
fight.

00:52:18.074 --> 00:52:21.349
LAURA: Oh, no. Oh no.

00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:22.750
MATT: So that's your turn.

00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:24.590
TRAVIS: But not as rough as Stitch over there,
huh?

00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:25.411
MATT: Yeah.

00:52:25.411 --> 00:52:26.552
LAURA: We're in a group.

00:52:26.552 --> 00:52:35.428
MATT: Yeah. (laughs) The creature does regain use
of its Lightning Breath.

00:52:35.428 --> 00:52:36.143
LIAM: Right.

00:52:36.143 --> 00:52:37.752
MATT: All right.

00:52:37.752 --> 00:52:40.042
TALIESIN: Oh, I was about to say, and--

00:52:40.042 --> 00:52:41.622
MATT: So you wanna move anywhere?

00:52:41.622 --> 00:52:44.759
TALIESIN: Yeah, I wanna get a little further back.
I wanna roll to the other side of the cave again,

00:52:44.759 --> 00:52:46.130
if possible.

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:47.110
MATT: Which way? You mean over here?

00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:49.811
TALIESIN: Yeah. Like, see that little outcropping
of rock?

00:52:49.811 --> 00:52:50.928
MATT: Right here?

00:52:50.928 --> 00:52:55.046
TALIESIN: Further back. Like that over there.

00:52:55.046 --> 00:52:56.357
MARISHA: That little chunky thing?

00:52:56.357 --> 00:52:57.859
MATT: Okay.

00:52:57.859 --> 00:52:59.372
LAURA: Smart move, Percy.

00:52:59.372 --> 00:53:00.470
MATT: All righty.

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:01.847
TALIESIN: That thing scares me.

00:53:01.847 --> 00:53:03.628
LAURA: Why are you abandoning me?

00:53:03.628 --> 00:53:11.736
MATT: Okay. That ends Percy's turn.

00:53:11.736 --> 00:53:14.578
TALIESIN: The beast.

00:53:14.578 --> 00:53:15.822
MARISHA: I don't like the dice that I have.

00:53:15.822 --> 00:53:18.905
TRAVIS: Don't think too hard.

00:53:19.357 --> 00:53:20.240
TALIESIN: That's not good.

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.218
SAM: No.

00:53:21.218 --> 00:53:23.227
LAURA: It just burps out lightning.

00:53:23.682 --> 00:53:26.632
TRAVIS: Jesus, I don't think we've ever seen
anything this hard.

00:53:26.632 --> 00:53:27.431
LAURA: I know.

00:53:27.431 --> 00:53:28.449
LIAM: Guys, guys.

00:53:28.449 --> 00:53:29.190
SAM: What is he doing?

00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:30.050
LIAM: Guys.

00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:30.854
MARISHA: Have you seen anything like it?

00:53:30.854 --> 00:53:31.607
SAM: What is he doing?

00:53:31.607 --> 00:53:32.249
LIAM: Guys.

00:53:32.249 --> 00:53:32.734
LAURA: He's thinking.

00:53:32.734 --> 00:53:33.449
LIAM: Guys.

00:53:33.449 --> 00:53:33.987
SAM: We broke the DM.

00:53:33.987 --> 00:53:34.522
LAURA: I know.

00:53:34.522 --> 00:53:35.541
TRAVIS: You know the silence before the storm?

00:53:35.541 --> 00:53:36.141
MATT: Considering optimal--

00:53:36.141 --> 00:53:36.720
LAURA: This is bad.

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.451
LIAM: He erupts.

00:53:37.451 --> 00:53:38.497
TRAVIS: He hasn't said anything.

00:53:38.497 --> 00:53:39.218
MATT: All right. So.

00:53:39.218 --> 00:53:41.683
(all groan)

00:53:41.683 --> 00:53:43.002
MARISHA: You stared at that for a really long
time.

00:53:43.002 --> 00:53:44.410
SAM: Here comes the other three.

00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:46.739
TRAVIS: Here comes the boom?

00:53:46.739 --> 00:53:57.408
MATT: So, this behir is going to shift back here.
You get an attack of opportunity on it, Keyleth.

00:53:57.408 --> 00:54:00.486
So go ahead and take a swing.

00:54:00.486 --> 00:54:01.434
LIAM: Burn it.

00:54:01.434 --> 00:54:02.408
SAM: Fire slap!

00:54:02.408 --> 00:54:03.998
MARISHA: So. 16.

00:54:03.998 --> 00:54:07.551
MATT: 16 just misses. It gets right out of your
grasp. The flames just lick across the outside of

00:54:07.551 --> 00:54:14.826
its scales. As it pulls back, rears down right in
your face, Godzilla-style, just unleashes a burst

00:54:14.826 --> 00:54:15.919
of electrical energy.

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:17.254
LAURA: Oh, God. Dodge it. Dodge it.

00:54:17.254 --> 00:54:20.787
MATT: It hits you and Keyleth. I need you guys to
both make dexterity saving throws.

00:54:20.787 --> 00:54:22.096
SAM: With inspiration.

00:54:22.096 --> 00:54:23.712
MARISHA: Who, me and Grog? Okay.

00:54:23.712 --> 00:54:25.187
SAM: With inspiration.

00:54:25.187 --> 00:54:26.098
TRAVIS: I don't need it.

00:54:26.098 --> 00:54:26.822
SAM: Okay.

00:54:26.822 --> 00:54:29.798
MARISHA: Dexterity saves? That's not good.

00:54:29.798 --> 00:54:32.895
TRAVIS: 19.

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:34.732
MARISHA: Four.

00:54:34.903 --> 00:54:38.796
MATT: 33 points of lightning damage to you, Grog.
66 to you.

00:54:38.796 --> 00:54:40.706
TRAVIS: Can I use my Stone's Endurance?

00:54:40.706 --> 00:54:41.296
MATT: You can.

00:54:41.296 --> 00:54:42.204
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:54:42.204 --> 00:54:43.519
TALIESIN: What?!

00:54:43.519 --> 00:54:44.627
MATT: What's the maximum health of Minxie's form?

00:54:44.627 --> 00:54:46.619
MARISHA: Looking-- I'm out.

00:54:46.619 --> 00:54:47.402
MATT: Okay.

00:54:47.402 --> 00:54:48.908
MARISHA: I'm now in Keyleth form.

00:54:48.908 --> 00:54:50.742
MATT: And how much damage goes over?

00:54:50.742 --> 00:54:53.548
MARISHA: Not that many, thank God. 12.

00:54:53.548 --> 00:54:57.682
MATT: 12. Okay, so you-- As Minxie all of a sudden
gets blasted, you can see the form shrink down to

00:54:57.682 --> 00:55:01.353
Keyleth's crumpled form on the ground, hands still
flaming, little bit of singe to the back of her

00:55:01.353 --> 00:55:04.015
hair, and stands back up.

00:55:04.015 --> 00:55:05.533
TALIESIN: I'll take that. I'll take that.

00:55:05.533 --> 00:55:08.569
(all laugh)

00:55:08.569 --> 00:55:10.416
LAURA: Oh no!

00:55:10.416 --> 00:55:12.961
MATT: That'll end its turn. Vex, you're up.

00:55:12.961 --> 00:55:13.999
MARISHA: That felt like Shockwave.

00:55:13.999 --> 00:55:27.917
LAURA: Oh, God. Can I, as a bonus action, give
Trinket a healing potion?

00:55:27.917 --> 00:55:30.910
MATT: You can-- that would be more of an action to
feed it to something else.

00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:33.745
LAURA: Okay, never mind. I am going to attack it.

00:55:33.806 --> 00:55:35.405
MATT: Okay.

00:55:35.405 --> 00:55:42.806
LAURA: Okay. He's, oh, I missed. That's a 14.

00:55:42.806 --> 00:55:47.754
MATT: A 14 does not hit, unfortunately. The first
arrow just ricochets and shatters across the part

00:55:47.754 --> 00:55:48.798
of its body.

00:55:48.798 --> 00:55:53.517
LAURA: Great. Good times, good times. 16. Both
miss. Fucking A. What a waste.

00:55:53.517 --> 00:55:55.759
MATT: Both arrows just explode across its hide.
It's too thick.

00:55:55.759 --> 00:56:03.759
LAURA: This dice is out for the rest of the game.
I'm gonna run. Is there an outcropping where we

00:56:03.759 --> 00:56:05.256
are? I can't see.

00:56:05.256 --> 00:56:08.041
MATT: Right here, a little bit. If you pull fully
in on this side from where it--

00:56:08.041 --> 00:56:09.591
LAURA: I'm going to pull fully in on that side.

00:56:09.591 --> 00:56:11.978
MATT: Okay. Don't forget your laser pointers, by
the way, guys. It's good for letting me know

00:56:11.978 --> 00:56:13.151
exactly where you want to go.

00:56:13.151 --> 00:56:14.689
LAURA: I can't see.

00:56:14.756 --> 00:56:16.860
MATT: I know. Just so you know. And Trinket's
going to stay there?

00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:19.573
LAURA: He's gonna rest. And he's going to keep
protecting Scanlan, because--

00:56:19.573 --> 00:56:22.119
MATT: All right. Trinket's gonna stay right there,
guarding the giant gnome.

00:56:22.119 --> 00:56:24.017
SAM: Oh, thank you. Giant gnome?

00:56:24.017 --> 00:56:27.759
MATT: Giant hand, small gnome. Grog, you're up.

00:56:27.759 --> 00:56:34.235
TRAVIS: (yells) I try and match the Godzilla roar,
it's not really as good, and I swing three times

00:56:34.235 --> 00:56:35.502
with my fire hammer.

00:56:35.502 --> 00:56:37.261
MATT: Go for it.

00:56:38.209 --> 00:56:39.588
TRAVIS: That's a 18.

00:56:39.588 --> 00:56:42.342
MATT: 18. That hits.

00:56:42.342 --> 00:56:44.585
TRAVIS: 21.

00:56:44.585 --> 00:56:47.078
MATT: 21 hits.

00:56:47.078 --> 00:56:48.547
TRAVIS: And 19.

00:56:48.547 --> 00:56:50.497
MATT: 19 hits. Roll damage.

00:56:50.497 --> 00:56:51.392
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

00:56:51.392 --> 00:56:55.950
TRAVIS: That anus! That's 13.

00:56:55.950 --> 00:57:00.335
LAURA: Eee, good.

00:57:00.335 --> 00:57:10.926
TRAVIS: 23, and 22.

00:57:10.926 --> 00:57:12.581
MATT: All righty. How do you want to do this?

00:57:12.644 --> 00:57:14.357
(all yell)

00:57:14.357 --> 00:57:17.900
TALIESIN: But you never said he looked a little
rough! I kept waiting for you to say it's looking

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:19.192
a little rough.

00:57:19.192 --> 00:57:20.393
MATT: It's hard to tell with this entity.

00:57:20.393 --> 00:57:21.318
TALIESIN: Damn it!

00:57:21.318 --> 00:57:22.348
MATT: It's moving so fast.

00:57:22.348 --> 00:57:23.896
TRAVIS: I'd like to reach up with my firebrand
warhammer.

00:57:23.896 --> 00:57:24.398
SAM: Yes!

00:57:24.398 --> 00:57:28.188
TRAVIS: And I would like to smash it on top of its
skull, and when it hits the ground, I'd just like to

00:57:28.188 --> 00:57:33.817
keep turning it into jelly and paste and sweet
jams that I can bottle it up and sell later!

00:57:33.873 --> 00:57:38.921
MATT: You guys watch this continuous barrage, this
horrible bludgeoning. Every impact almost quakes

00:57:38.921 --> 00:57:44.860
the inside of this valley. Rocks are beginning to
tumble and fall around it. And you can see, as

00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:51.332
each horrible, sickening smack, its head just
collapses more and more. The mush begins to spill

00:57:51.332 --> 00:57:56.676
out from under it, this giant pool of, like, dark
violet liquid and gelatinous mush that was once

00:57:56.676 --> 00:58:03.321
the inside of its head, begin to just grow around
it as Grog just keeps hitting and hitting and

00:58:03.321 --> 00:58:07.501
hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting--

00:58:07.501 --> 00:58:08.970
MARISHA: Grog? Grog?

00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:10.033
MATT: And hitting and hitting--

00:58:10.033 --> 00:58:10.873
LAURA: Grog?

00:58:10.873 --> 00:58:12.419
SAM: I use Bigby's Hand to stop the hammer.

00:58:12.419 --> 00:58:19.069
LAURA: Maybe you unrage. Lullaby, Hulk.
Lullaby.

00:58:19.238 --> 00:58:20.109
SAM: It's over. It's over.

00:58:20.109 --> 00:58:24.149
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Lullaby?!

00:58:24.149 --> 00:58:26.711
SAM: Think of the beard.

00:58:26.711 --> 00:58:28.844
TRAVIS: What happened?

00:58:28.844 --> 00:58:29.648
TALIESIN: Well.

00:58:29.648 --> 00:58:30.714
LAURA: You killed it real good!

00:58:30.714 --> 00:58:33.597
TRAVIS: Oh, look, we made jelly.

00:58:34.324 --> 00:58:37.913
MARISHA: Speaking of jelly, I would like to go
ahead and do a nature check to see if I can

00:58:37.913 --> 00:58:40.886
salvage some goods from whatever.

00:58:40.886 --> 00:58:45.415
LAURA: I run, I walk up to it and kick it, and
say, that's for Trinket. Dick.

00:58:45.415 --> 00:58:47.396
MATT: Okay.

00:58:47.396 --> 00:58:50.160
TRAVIS: Can I roll a hit dice to recover some--

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.282
MATT: If you guys want to take a short rest, you
can.

00:58:52.282 --> 00:58:52.919
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:58:52.919 --> 00:58:53.868
LAURA: That'd be great.

00:58:53.868 --> 00:58:56.478
TALIESIN: Yes! I would like to fix my gun.
Just a giant pile of tools.

00:58:56.478 --> 00:59:00.537
LAURA: Do we need to hide? Do we need to climb up
to its little cave that it was in, maybe?

00:59:00.599 --> 00:59:01.674
And hide.

00:59:01.674 --> 00:59:02.713
SAM: Did it have a cave?

00:59:02.713 --> 00:59:03.570
TRAVIS: Was it in a cave?

00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:05.169
LAURA: It had a cave. Didn't it come out of a
cave, when we saw it?

00:59:05.169 --> 00:59:07.911
MATT: You saw it was up on a higher platform, you
didn't see a cavern, or anything.

00:59:07.911 --> 00:59:08.986
LAURA: Oh, I thought it was a cave.

00:59:08.986 --> 00:59:12.204
MARISHA: I rolled a 21 to collect goods.

00:59:12.204 --> 00:59:18.727
MATT: Okay, looking through the book that you
have. You eventually take a while to look while

00:59:18.727 --> 00:59:23.217
you guys are having your short rest. You can use
your hit dice to heal yourself.

00:59:23.217 --> 00:59:24.652
It is known as a behir.

00:59:24.652 --> 00:59:25.623
SAM: A behir?

00:59:25.623 --> 00:59:27.125
MATT: B-E-H-I-R.

00:59:27.125 --> 00:59:28.360
MARISHA: B-E-H-I-R.

00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.559
TALIESIN: Behir.

00:59:30.559 --> 00:59:32.088
TRAVIS: Be here.

00:59:32.088 --> 00:59:33.956
LAURA: Be here right now. Be present.

00:59:33.956 --> 00:59:39.118
MATT: Behir. There are two things. Anything in the
face and teeth are gone. They are just mush. The

00:59:39.118 --> 00:59:40.462
entire head is destroyed.

00:59:40.462 --> 00:59:41.746
MARISHA: Sure.

00:59:41.746 --> 00:59:48.334
MATT: The the two things in the book that are
worthwhile, like, really worth money, are some of

00:59:48.334 --> 00:59:57.627
its hide can be repurposed for, you know, like,
lightning resist-based armor, but currently it's

00:59:57.627 --> 01:00:03.473
unknown who has the speciality to actually work
with that material. These creatures are difficult to

01:00:03.473 --> 01:00:07.082
harvest and a lot of their locations are unknown.
A lot of them were hunted down for that long ago

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:08.742
and almost thought to have gone extinct.

01:00:08.742 --> 01:00:10.572
(all groan)

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:18.057
MATT: However, yes, you don't know anybody,
possibly Karin in Emon. The hide can be harvested.

01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:24.325
There is also a gland in its throat that it uses
to charge its Lightning Breath.

01:00:25.266 --> 01:00:27.054
TALIESIN: I'd like that.

01:00:27.054 --> 01:00:28.245
MARISHA: I'd like that.

01:00:28.245 --> 01:00:30.989
MATT: Go ahead and roll for the hide first, if you
guys want to go for that.

01:00:31.174 --> 01:00:34.697
LAURA: Can I stealth and climb up and see if I can
see a cavern?

01:00:34.697 --> 01:00:35.647
MATT: Sure.

01:00:35.647 --> 01:00:36.327
LAURA: A little cave.

01:00:36.327 --> 01:00:37.445
MARISHA: Natural 20!

01:00:37.445 --> 01:00:38.488
TRAVIS: Oh snap!

01:00:38.488 --> 01:00:39.671
LAURA: Yeah!

01:00:39.671 --> 01:00:41.323
TRAVIS: I'll take it.

01:00:44.534 --> 01:00:47.162
SAM: She gets advantage because mountains are
her favorite terrain.

01:00:47.338 --> 01:00:48.683
LAURA: What do I add to that?

01:00:48.683 --> 01:00:50.020
MATT: This would be, add your--

01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:50.797
LAURA: Acrobatics?

01:00:50.797 --> 01:00:51.979
MATT: For climb, this would be athletics.

01:00:51.979 --> 01:00:56.524
LAURA: Athletics. Oh, really? That's not what it
was; I moved it.

01:00:56.524 --> 01:00:57.957
LIAM: It was 14, I saw it.

01:00:57.957 --> 01:01:01.494
LAURA: Oh no, 12.

01:01:01.494 --> 01:01:05.384
MATT: It takes you a little bit to get up there.
It's steep, you slide down a few times. But

01:01:05.384 --> 01:01:08.876
eventually, because there's no immediate threat,
you're given time to get up onto this upper

01:01:08.945 --> 01:01:13.465
platform. You can see that there are these various
parts of the rock that jut outward, that have some

01:01:13.465 --> 01:01:16.944
short term passageways that this creature uses.

01:01:16.944 --> 01:01:20.210
LAURA: I'm so weak, but I'm holding to see if I
see a cave.

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:23.792
MATT: (laughs) Roll a perception check.

01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:24.815
LAURA: (groans)

01:01:24.815 --> 01:01:29.954
MATT: Once you're up there. You take time and with
help from some other folks, you manage to harvest,

01:01:30.028 --> 01:01:37.563
I'd say about ten pounds worth of scales at most.
It's not a whole lot. A lot of it has been torn

01:01:37.563 --> 01:01:43.672
and destroyed from the impact and damage you guys
did. Parts of it are not really armory functional,

01:01:43.672 --> 01:01:48.322
but you manage to get enough to maybe make one set
if somebody manages to work really well with it.

01:01:48.447 --> 01:01:49.860
MARISHA: Here, Grog, bag of holding.

01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:50.630
LAURA: 23.

01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:55.352
MATT: 23? Currently, you have no eye shot on any
particular--

01:01:55.352 --> 01:01:57.173
SAM: Don't eat it, Grog.

01:01:57.173 --> 01:02:01.616
MATT: -- tunnels. Nothing that resembles an abode
or a cavern from this position.

01:02:01.616 --> 01:02:02.745
TALIESIN: Lick it.

01:02:02.745 --> 01:02:03.607
LAURA: (groans)

01:02:03.607 --> 01:02:04.892
LIAM: I see my sister's struggling.

01:02:04.892 --> 01:02:05.676
LAURA: Oh god it hurts.

01:02:05.676 --> 01:02:07.543
LIAM: I climb up next to her.

01:02:07.543 --> 01:02:09.413
LAURA: You're almost as weak as I am, dude.

01:02:09.413 --> 01:02:10.179
LIAM: Yeah.

01:02:10.179 --> 01:02:10.901
LAURA: Here we go.

01:02:10.901 --> 01:02:11.629
LIAM: Acrobatics? What is it?

01:02:11.629 --> 01:02:12.274
MATT: Athletics.

01:02:12.274 --> 01:02:13.009
LAURA: Athletics.

01:02:13.009 --> 01:02:13.656
TRAVIS: Athletics.

01:02:13.656 --> 01:02:15.074
LIAM: Athletics? Oh, shit. Acrobatics would have
been much better.

01:02:15.074 --> 01:02:15.769
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, c'mon.

01:02:15.769 --> 01:02:16.444
LAURA: I know, I don't think so.

01:02:16.444 --> 01:02:17.313
LIAM: Can I flip up there?

01:02:17.313 --> 01:02:18.237
MATT: Eh, it doesn't work like that.

01:02:18.237 --> 01:02:19.739
LIAM: No, no--

01:02:19.739 --> 01:02:20.312
(all laugh)

01:02:20.312 --> 01:02:20.996
TRAVIS: No, I can't.

01:02:20.996 --> 01:02:21.998
LIAM: Wait, I'll use Luck. I'll do it again to
get--

01:02:21.998 --> 01:02:22.562
MATT: Go for it.

01:02:22.562 --> 01:02:23.328
TRAVIS: You're going to use one of your Lucks?

01:02:23.328 --> 01:02:24.247
LIAM: -- to get past that one.

01:02:24.247 --> 01:02:25.317
LAURA: No, we were about to rest. Wow.

01:02:25.317 --> 01:02:26.049
LIAM: Oh, no, I didn't.

01:02:26.049 --> 01:02:27.102
LAURA: Oh, really, you rolled worse than me.

01:02:27.102 --> 01:02:30.739
LIAM: Oh no, my fingernail, that really stings.
Damn it.

01:02:30.785 --> 01:02:31.758
MATT: The twins give a--

01:02:31.758 --> 01:02:32.525
MARISHA: Just terrible.

01:02:32.525 --> 01:02:34.953
MATT: -- terrible display of rock climbing in the
middle of this.

01:02:34.953 --> 01:02:35.936
TRAVIS: I laugh heartily.

01:02:35.936 --> 01:02:38.613
TALIESIN: Parkour! Parkour!

01:02:40.824 --> 01:02:43.234
MATT: Go ahead and roll for the glands.

01:02:43.234 --> 01:02:44.012
MARISHA: The glands?

01:02:44.012 --> 01:02:46.356
LIAM: Stupid video game moment of like jump, jump,
jump, jump.

01:02:46.356 --> 01:02:47.591
LAURA: Like Skyrim trying to get--

01:02:47.591 --> 01:02:54.830
MARISHA: Glands? 18 is not bad. I'll take that
18 for a 28. Hey, Vax, can I see your dagger?

01:02:55.064 --> 01:02:56.228
LIAM: Yeah, here you go.

01:02:56.228 --> 01:02:57.333
SAM: He's up a hill.

01:02:57.333 --> 01:03:01.968
LAURA: Nice. We didn't even get up a little bit.

01:03:01.968 --> 01:03:05.147
MATT: It takes most of your short rest. You will
not be able to use your hit dice for healing on

01:03:05.147 --> 01:03:13.669
this, because you spend your time harvesting
instead. But you manage to-- thankfully, the

01:03:13.834 --> 01:03:19.046
damage that Grog had inflicted upon its head
destroyed most of its matter, right up to the

01:03:19.046 --> 01:03:24.579
throat gland which is mostly untouched. It's
salvageable. You don't know how much it's worth.

01:03:24.579 --> 01:03:28.681
Probably a decent amount, as the book says that
they're rare. Especially to find intact.

01:03:28.681 --> 01:03:30.583
TRAVIS: That Grog, what a dick.

01:03:30.583 --> 01:03:34.673
TALIESIN: We have jars. I'm going to put that into
the jar and put it away.

01:03:34.673 --> 01:03:36.485
TRAVIS: There's not even like a tooth. Like one
broken tooth? A piece?

01:03:36.485 --> 01:03:37.615
MATT: You did a number on that one's face.

01:03:37.615 --> 01:03:39.100
TRAVIS: When Grog goes to work.

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:42.606
LIAM Boom. Kill the behir, take its glands,
money.

01:03:42.606 --> 01:03:44.473
TALIESIN: I may have something I can do with this
actually.

01:03:44.473 --> 01:03:46.399
TRAVIS: With what, the gland?

01:03:46.399 --> 01:03:47.867
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:50.159
MARISHA: Maybe, yes. (electricity noises)

01:03:50.159 --> 01:03:52.983
TALIESIN: You're very clever, yes. We'll work on
that.

01:03:52.983 --> 01:03:55.050
TRAVIS: Hello? I don't speak your language.

01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:56.339
MATT: You place it within a preservation jar.

01:03:56.531 --> 01:03:57.141
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:03:57.217 --> 01:03:58.084
MATT: Back in the bag of holding?

01:03:58.084 --> 01:03:59.105
TALIESIN: Back in the bag of holding.

01:03:59.105 --> 01:03:59.785
MATT: Okay.

01:03:59.785 --> 01:04:01.851
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and fix this mess, for
a minute.

01:04:01.851 --> 01:04:04.116
MATT: Go ahead and make your check.

01:04:05.377 --> 01:04:06.399
TALIESIN: 18.

01:04:06.399 --> 01:04:10.591
MATT: 18. It does cost you half the--

01:04:10.591 --> 01:04:13.106
TALIESIN: It wasn't a dual fail.

01:04:13.106 --> 01:04:17.399
MATT: Oh right, just a single fail. It was a dual
fail, but it was separate.

01:04:17.399 --> 01:04:18.224
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:04:18.224 --> 01:04:22.379
MATT: You take some time with it during the short
rest to tinker with it. You manage to bend the

01:04:22.379 --> 01:04:30.262
metal back in place. Test it for a bit. Make sure
the aspects that move move smoothly as they

01:04:30.262 --> 01:04:38.347
should. Eventually, you get pretty confident that
it is back to a functional piece of weaponry. All

01:04:38.347 --> 01:04:41.921
right, so, as you guys finish this rest--

01:04:41.921 --> 01:04:43.386
TRAVIS: I'm rolling one more hit dice.

01:04:43.386 --> 01:04:50.875
MATT: Go for it. The sky is starting to get a
little bit into the orangish color. Though you can

01:04:50.875 --> 01:04:55.135
not see the sun from its current location, you
gather you have about an hour and a half or so

01:04:55.135 --> 01:04:57.582
before full sundown.

01:04:59.113 --> 01:05:05.097
SAM: Let's get out of this little taco in case
that was the daughter of something else.

01:05:05.097 --> 01:05:07.180
MATT: Wait, you guys stayed the night-- never
mind, in the cavern.

01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:08.923
So actually, no, I take that back.

01:05:08.923 --> 01:05:09.744
SAM: Oh?

01:05:09.744 --> 01:05:11.747
MATT: I just realized you guys stayed the night
last time over on the

01:05:11.747 --> 01:05:13.128
seaside cavern and walked here--

01:05:13.128 --> 01:05:13.830
TRAVIS: That's right.

01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:15.930
MATT: -- and it only took you a few hours to get
here. So, no, it'd be about mid-day noon.

01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:16.640
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:17.703
MATT: So, I take that back. Never mind.

01:05:17.703 --> 01:05:18.329
LIAM: Ah.

01:05:18.329 --> 01:05:19.384
SAM: We should still go.

01:05:19.384 --> 01:05:20.579
MATT: Can see the sun, it is straight above.

01:05:20.579 --> 01:05:21.730
TALIESIN: We should still get out of the taco.

01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:23.187
MATT: There is some cloud cover coming in.

01:05:23.187 --> 01:05:24.200
TRAVIS: Definitely should still leave.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:28.410
MATT: From the north side, it doesn't look like
anything too dense.

01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:29.021
MARISHA: Percy?

01:05:29.021 --> 01:05:30.024
TALIESIN: Yes?

01:05:30.024 --> 01:05:32.863
MARISHA: Do you know how much longer we need to
continue on this path?

01:05:32.863 --> 01:05:40.319
TALIESIN: Honestly, I've never taken this road
before. This is further east than I've ever come.

01:05:40.786 --> 01:05:46.570
MARISHA: Can we see how far ahead-- does it look
like it goes on for a while, this chasm?

01:05:46.645 --> 01:05:49.608
MATT: It moves around, so it's hard to get to much
of a visual of the--

01:05:49.608 --> 01:05:51.992
TALIESIN: The geology starting to look familiar?

01:05:51.992 --> 01:05:54.238
LAURA: Does my tracking tell me anything?

01:05:54.319 --> 01:05:58.418
MATT: You can go ahead and make a nature check.

01:05:58.418 --> 01:05:59.890
LIAM: For all of this, I'd like to--

01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:00.962
MATT: With advantage.

01:06:00.962 --> 01:06:04.111
LIAM: -- walk about 40 feet in front of everyone
and creep along.

01:06:04.111 --> 01:06:05.345
MATT: Okay.

01:06:05.345 --> 01:06:06.053
LAURA: 17.

01:06:06.053 --> 01:06:06.789
LIAM: Cloak up.

01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:07.672
MATT: Make a stealth check.

01:06:07.672 --> 01:06:08.498
SAM: He's a weird loner, that guy.

01:06:08.498 --> 01:06:09.072
TRAVIS: He is.

01:06:09.072 --> 01:06:09.739
LIAM: It's my job.

01:06:09.739 --> 01:06:13.429
MATT: Make a stealth check. The mountains here got
its name for the white stone mountains.

01:06:13.429 --> 01:06:14.270
The rock--

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:16.257
TALIESIN: It's starting to look like home, though?

01:06:16.257 --> 01:06:21.597
MATT: Yeah. The mountain range here is a large
part of the material that is mined, well, was

01:06:21.597 --> 01:06:28.173
mined beneath the-- It's very rare white
quartz-like rock that is used for many purposes.

01:06:28.173 --> 01:06:32.333
And it's generally only found in this mountain
range. It's what a lot of the Whitestone's

01:06:32.333 --> 01:06:35.076
original economy was based on.

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:36.065
LIAM: 22.

01:06:36.065 --> 01:06:37.776
MATT: 22, good to know. All right, so.

01:06:37.776 --> 01:06:40.970
LAURA: 17 on nature.

01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:44.261
MATT: Okay. I mean, you gather the same thing. The
rock formations here match the same as the coastal

01:06:44.261 --> 01:06:50.416
mountains. The mountain here is all made of the
same material, few deposits here and there of just

01:06:50.416 --> 01:06:53.949
normal bits of granite and other forms of simple
stone.

01:06:55.658 --> 01:06:56.687
LAURA: Granite.

01:06:56.687 --> 01:06:57.409
SAM: Oh.

01:06:57.409 --> 01:06:58.146
LAURA: Simple stone.

01:06:58.146 --> 01:06:59.370
(all laugh)

01:06:59.370 --> 01:07:01.321
TRAVIS: That was so much better than shopping.

01:07:01.321 --> 01:07:03.999
(all laugh)

01:07:03.999 --> 01:07:13.762
MATT: As you guys are pressing forward, at this
point, you guys are taking your time waiting and

01:07:13.887 --> 01:07:23.436
Tiberius is getting impatient, and is crossing his
arms. "I feel like I should have gotten more

01:07:23.436 --> 01:07:26.046
"materials. I don't think I'm quite prepared enough
for this."

01:07:26.046 --> 01:07:29.197
LAURA: What? Tiberius, you prepared a lot.

01:07:29.197 --> 01:07:30.245
LIAM: Tibs.

01:07:30.245 --> 01:07:31.469
MATT: "Not enough. Never enough".

01:07:31.469 --> 01:07:35.276
LIAM: You brought along a sack of mirrors, I think
you've got enough. What do you need?

01:07:35.276 --> 01:07:37.937
MATT: "I have an idea. I'll be back in a few
days."

01:07:37.937 --> 01:07:39.701
ALL: What, no?

01:07:39.701 --> 01:07:40.710
SAM: Don't leave.

01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:43.337
MATT: He sits down and starts making his
teleportation circle.

01:07:43.337 --> 01:07:44.801
LAURA: No, no, we need that!

01:07:44.801 --> 01:07:45.556
LIAM: Tiberius.

01:07:45.556 --> 01:07:46.109
LAURA: We need that.

01:07:46.109 --> 01:07:46.798
LIAM: Tiberius.

01:07:46.798 --> 01:07:47.535
LAURA: We need that. Tiberius.

01:07:47.535 --> 01:07:51.830
LIAM: You are a heavy hitter, we don't know where
we're going, what we're doing. He's strong. You're

01:07:51.830 --> 01:07:55.062
strong, in a way, maybe hang out a little bit
longer.

01:07:55.062 --> 01:07:57.186
LAURA: He's actually got a lot of hit points, really.

01:07:57.186 --> 01:07:58.592
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's got a lot.

01:07:58.646 --> 01:07:59.654
MATT: (laughs)

01:07:59.654 --> 01:08:04.294
LIAM: More than I do. You're stronger in frame
than I am. Sure you want to go?

01:08:04.294 --> 01:08:07.239
MATT: Tiberius leans in and whispers to you in a
strange tongue and it sparks in your ear

01:08:07.239 --> 01:08:11.371
somewhere. (whispers) "The player's not here and
the DM's trying to not make it too complicated for

01:08:11.371 --> 01:08:13.763
"him to keep track of an additional character for
this session."

01:08:13.833 --> 01:08:14.936
(all laugh)

01:08:14.936 --> 01:08:15.847
LAURA: I understand that.

01:08:15.847 --> 01:08:17.887
LIAM: (whispers) I know, but I'm just trying to
give you a hard time.

01:08:17.887 --> 01:08:19.357
(all laugh)

01:08:19.357 --> 01:08:20.572
MATT: I'll remember that.

01:08:20.572 --> 01:08:21.455
LAURA: Oh, no.

01:08:21.455 --> 01:08:24.308
TALIESIN: I grab Lockheed and we hold him
hostage.

01:08:24.308 --> 01:08:26.465
(all laugh)

01:08:26.465 --> 01:08:27.797
MARISHA: You can't leave!

01:08:27.797 --> 01:08:28.683
(all laugh)

01:08:28.683 --> 01:08:29.954
LAURA: We need you.

01:08:29.954 --> 01:08:33.282
MATT: "Don't worry, I'll be back soon and now I
know how to find you."

01:08:33.282 --> 01:08:35.736
LIAM: (whispers) Send an iPad with Pike on it.

01:08:35.736 --> 01:08:38.523
(all laugh)

01:08:38.523 --> 01:08:43.412
MATT: He finishes his teleportation circle and
with a whoosh, with a flash, vanishes.

01:08:43.412 --> 01:08:46.811
LAURA: Shit. Really, Tiberius, really?

01:08:46.811 --> 01:08:47.881
MARISHA: He does that a lot.

01:08:47.881 --> 01:08:49.450
SAM: It's very much in his character.

01:08:49.450 --> 01:08:50.376
LAURA: (groans)

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:51.945
TRAVIS: Where'd Tiberius go?

01:08:51.945 --> 01:08:53.369
LIAM: He went to get an army, I think.

01:08:53.369 --> 01:08:54.702
LAURA: (groans)

01:08:54.702 --> 01:08:55.481
TRAVIS: That's fine.

01:08:55.481 --> 01:08:56.862
TALIESIN: Or more mirrors.

01:08:56.862 --> 01:08:58.256
MARISHA: It might be more mirrors.

01:08:58.256 --> 01:08:59.424
TALIESIN: Or an army with mirrors.

01:08:59.424 --> 01:09:02.165
MARISHA: An army with mirrors.

01:09:02.165 --> 01:09:07.147
LIAM: I can do magic. I do this great coin trick
thing where I flip it on my thumb and then it

01:09:07.147 --> 01:09:08.264
lands in my hand.

01:09:08.264 --> 01:09:09.156
LAURA: And then, you pull it--

01:09:09.156 --> 01:09:10.064
LIAM: That's the end of it.

01:09:10.064 --> 01:09:10.926
LAURA: -- out of someone's ear.

01:09:10.926 --> 01:09:11.702
LIAM: It's right here.

01:09:11.702 --> 01:09:12.479
LAURA: Whoa!

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:14.043
TRAVIS: We start walking.

01:09:14.043 --> 01:09:14.866
MARISHA: That's fun.

01:09:14.866 --> 01:09:15.770
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm walking.

01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:16.645
MATT: Progressing forward--

01:09:16.645 --> 01:09:17.573
MARISHA: It's a start.

01:09:17.573 --> 01:09:19.438
MATT: -- you begin to--

01:09:19.438 --> 01:09:21.857
TRAVIS: Jauntily stealth ahead.

01:09:21.857 --> 01:09:24.653
LIAM: 40 feet out, yeah.

01:09:24.917 --> 01:09:26.169
TRAVIS: Like a beagle.

01:09:26.169 --> 01:09:29.722
LAURA: I keep a perception out to see anything.

01:09:29.722 --> 01:09:32.149
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye open for anything
familiar.

01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:41.853
SAM: Can I just bump into Vex and ask her to maybe
scan ahead for dragons?

01:09:41.853 --> 01:09:43.588
LAURA: What do you think I'm doing?

01:09:43.588 --> 01:09:44.770
SAM: Dragons, though. Six miles.

01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:45.588
LAURA: I'm scanning.

01:09:45.588 --> 01:09:49.758
SAM: Don't you have six miles of dragons or
something? Thank you.

01:09:49.758 --> 01:09:50.961
TALIESIN: Do you have to do the hands?

01:09:50.961 --> 01:09:51.855
TRAVIS: Is that your scanning face?

01:09:51.855 --> 01:09:52.763
MATT: It's good to help out in the--

01:09:52.763 --> 01:09:53.488
LAURA: I'm thinking.

01:09:53.488 --> 01:09:54.272
SAM: Six miles of dragons.

01:09:54.272 --> 01:09:57.950
LAURA: I'm wanting to see if I see any dragons. Do
I see any dragons?

01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:59.264
TRAVIS: I thought you did a different technique
last time.

01:09:59.264 --> 01:10:04.527
MATT: You take a moment and anticipate the
circumstance, and there is, within-- what's the

01:10:04.527 --> 01:10:05.475
distance on it?

01:10:05.475 --> 01:10:06.719
ALL: Six miles.

01:10:06.719 --> 01:10:07.573
MATT: Six miles?

01:10:07.573 --> 01:10:08.244
LIAM: Yeah, man.

01:10:08.244 --> 01:10:15.030
MATT: You ascertain that there are quite a few
sources of life in this vicinity, of some sort of

01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:17.803
dragon kin or dragon-like entity.

01:10:17.803 --> 01:10:22.598
LAURA: Was the behir a dragony sort of thing?

01:10:22.598 --> 01:10:29.152
MATT: No. Technically not, from what you can
gather, but you do gather there are a few blips

01:10:29.152 --> 01:10:33.989
that are three miles off north, at the center of
the mountain range. You don't know how big or how

01:10:33.989 --> 01:10:39.437
dangerous, but you sense there are some dragon or
dragon kin sources.

01:10:39.437 --> 01:10:41.192
LAURA: There's a dragony something.

01:10:41.192 --> 01:10:43.267
SAM: Could be dragon eggs.

01:10:43.267 --> 01:10:44.235
MARISHA: Dragonborn?

01:10:44.235 --> 01:10:45.319
LAURA: I don't know, Scanlan.

01:10:45.319 --> 01:10:47.509
MARISHA: You're not picking up Tiberius six miles
away?

01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:48.705
LAURA: There's dragony things, though.

01:10:48.705 --> 01:10:52.088
SAM: Listen. When I poo somewhere, I can see
everything.

01:10:52.088 --> 01:10:55.576
LAURA: I didn't poo. I'm sensing with my mind.

01:10:55.576 --> 01:10:59.941
TRAVIS: Listen, if we do run across a dragon,
remember we have the dragon slayer longsword,

01:10:59.996 --> 01:11:04.263
which is a plus one to attack and damage rolls,
and if you hit a dragon or a dragon creature, it

01:11:04.263 --> 01:11:06.313
gets an extra 3d6 of damage.

01:11:06.313 --> 01:11:08.261
LAURA: What are you reading? How did you even know
that?

01:11:08.261 --> 01:11:10.621
TALIESIN: That's the most complicated sentence I
think I've ever heard you speak.

01:11:10.621 --> 01:11:12.314
TRAVIS: Sorry, I blacked out for a little bit.

01:11:12.314 --> 01:11:15.087
(all laugh)

01:11:15.087 --> 01:11:15.847
TALIESIN: Nothing.

01:11:15.847 --> 01:11:17.400
LAURA: Nothing. You're good, Grog.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:21.970
TRAVIS: What do you have to do to attunement?

01:11:22.204 --> 01:11:26.500
MATT: Attunement, you take a short rest with the
weapon, learning its properties.

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:27.830
TRAVIS: Caressing it?

01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:30.641
MATT: Essentially. Stroking it, making sure it
feels comfortable.

01:11:30.641 --> 01:11:31.599
TALIESIN: Buying it dinner.

01:11:31.599 --> 01:11:33.793
MATT: Nice spread so it feels welcome.

01:11:33.793 --> 01:11:34.850
TRAVIS: That's more than I usually do.

01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:38.673
LAURA: Maybe a steak, some salad. Shrimp
cocktail.

01:11:38.673 --> 01:11:40.930
TRAVIS: Just in case you need a sword.

01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:48.006
LIAM: As we progress, I say into my earring,
Scanlan, I've seen some of the logs she's left

01:11:48.006 --> 01:11:49.814
behind. They're not small.

01:11:49.814 --> 01:11:53.093
LAURA: (gasps) You are seriously. What?

01:11:53.093 --> 01:11:53.871
TALIESIN: Wow.

01:11:53.871 --> 01:11:54.789
LAURA: That's disgusting.

01:11:54.789 --> 01:11:56.584
TRAVIS: I missed it. It must be good, though.

01:11:56.584 --> 01:11:58.047
SAM: She usually buries them quite well.

01:11:58.047 --> 01:12:00.558
LAURA: Really gross, both of you. Enough.

01:12:00.558 --> 01:12:01.983
LIAM: They don't sense anything.

01:12:01.983 --> 01:12:03.457
SAM: All right.

01:12:03.457 --> 01:12:04.761
TALIESIN: Well, we're not heading north.

01:12:04.761 --> 01:12:06.320
SAM: We're not?

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.531
MATT: You guys are heading eastish.

01:12:07.531 --> 01:12:10.857
TALIESIN: Westish. We're heading westish.

01:12:10.857 --> 01:12:11.578
LAURA: Nothing that I can sense.

01:12:11.578 --> 01:12:12.435
TRAVIS: Can we keep walking?

01:12:12.435 --> 01:12:15.392
MATT: You guys came up on the eastern side--
sorry, the western side of the mountains. You're

01:12:15.392 --> 01:12:16.130
now heading eastward.

01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:17.227
TALIESIN: Oh, we came up on the western side of
the mountains?

01:12:17.227 --> 01:12:18.601
LAURA: There's nothing that we're going to run
across.

01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:22.328
LIAM: Just flip that.

01:12:22.328 --> 01:12:23.537
MARISHA: Western side of the mountains?

01:12:23.537 --> 01:12:27.636
TALIESIN: Western side of the mountains? So
Whitestone's to the east?

01:12:27.636 --> 01:12:28.999
MATT: Whitestone would be to the east of you
guys.

01:12:28.999 --> 01:12:33.144
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. I thought we went up the
eastern side of the mountains. I'm so confused.

01:12:33.144 --> 01:12:34.747
You wouldn't think I'd lived here before.

01:12:34.747 --> 01:12:36.692
MATT: That would have brought you through the
forest, and you were trying to avoid that. That's

01:12:36.692 --> 01:12:37.754
what I thought you said last time.

01:12:37.754 --> 01:12:39.227
TALIESIN: No, that's very true. Oh, god.

01:12:39.227 --> 01:12:41.740
TRAVIS: West side's on the shore side, right? Ocean's
there?

01:12:41.939 --> 01:12:45.215
MATT: There's a giant peninsula to the north.
Either side would have been coast.

01:12:45.215 --> 01:12:46.732
LAURA: So we're not going to run into any
dragons?

01:12:46.732 --> 01:12:47.821
SAM: At least we're not going north.

01:12:47.821 --> 01:12:51.239
MATT: You're aware that they're not anywhere close
to you to currently be an issue, no.

01:12:51.239 --> 01:12:52.342
LAURA: Okay, we're fine.

01:12:52.342 --> 01:12:53.822
TALIESIN: In two or three miles, we'll take
another check.

01:12:53.822 --> 01:12:55.821
LAURA: Yeah.

01:12:55.821 --> 01:12:58.723
TRAVIS: (laughs) He winked at me!

01:12:58.723 --> 01:13:00.320
MATT: All right, so.

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:01.794
TRAVIS: It's like being blessed.

01:13:01.794 --> 01:13:03.466
SAM: We're going to just keep going towards the
town.

01:13:03.466 --> 01:13:07.299
MATT: You guys press on, following this winding
path that narrows at certain points and then

01:13:07.299 --> 01:13:16.804
widens for a bit. You come across, partway
through, the twins at the front notice, around the

01:13:16.804 --> 01:13:22.877
edges as it begins to descend down into the
beginning of the valley descent, you see an edge

01:13:22.877 --> 01:13:29.539
of the mountain that looks more angular than the
usual natural formations of it. It almost looks

01:13:29.539 --> 01:13:33.988
like it comes to a point, like a very sharp edge,
and a smooth side.

01:13:34.774 --> 01:13:37.590
LIAM: I'm not sure I understand. We see a
drop-off?

01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:41.832
MATT: It begins to descend towards the valley, and
on the side of one of the giant--

01:13:41.832 --> 01:13:42.916
TRAVIS: Chasms?

01:13:42.916 --> 01:13:47.353
MATT: Chasm you guys are at the bottom of. You see
an outcropping ahead that's angular and pointed.

01:13:47.353 --> 01:13:48.986
SAM: Like, designed by man?

01:13:48.986 --> 01:13:51.338
MATT: Like it was sculpted, constructed.

01:13:51.338 --> 01:13:52.570
TRAVIS: That might have sentries.

01:13:52.570 --> 01:13:57.879
LIAM: Some sort of outlook or something. Something
that was not formed by nature here.

01:13:57.879 --> 01:13:59.266
TALIESIN: Do I know what this is?

01:13:59.266 --> 01:14:01.212
MATT: You--

01:14:01.212 --> 01:14:04.619
TALIESIN: History check?

01:14:04.619 --> 01:14:08.875
MATT: I'd say, make an intelligence check. Roll
and add your intelligence modifier.

01:14:08.875 --> 01:14:10.850
TRAVIS: I could do it with you, if you want.

01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:13.255
MATT: You can make a history check. You know many
things that exist here in the mountains, but at

01:14:13.255 --> 01:14:15.906
this distance, you don't see enough of it to
actually--

01:14:15.906 --> 01:14:17.963
LAURA: (shocked noise)

01:14:17.963 --> 01:14:19.124
TRAVIS: He's not going to let me do it.

01:14:19.124 --> 01:14:20.295
LAURA: He rolled a natural 20.

01:14:20.295 --> 01:14:21.052
MATT: For?

01:14:21.052 --> 01:14:23.230
TRAVIS: An intelligence check, because I'm an
idiot.

01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:24.299
SAM: He doesn't know the--

01:14:24.299 --> 01:14:27.041
TALIESIN: I kind of want Grog to speak truth right
here.

01:14:27.041 --> 01:14:28.864
LAURA: He's an expert on mountains.

01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:34.356
MATT: Actually, this works out interestingly. As
you guys are walking forward and you're seeing

01:14:34.356 --> 01:14:39.914
this, and you're keeping back, Grog, you
instinctively look over and go, oh. That's a

01:14:39.914 --> 01:14:42.514
stone giant fortress.

01:14:42.514 --> 01:14:45.230
ALL: Oh!

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:46.657
MARISHA: Shut up!

01:14:46.657 --> 01:14:48.352
TRAVIS: (laughs) I did something smart!

01:14:48.352 --> 01:14:50.306
(all laugh)

01:14:50.306 --> 01:14:53.741
MATT: With your bloodline and knowing where you
come from, and you've had a few close encounters

01:14:53.741 --> 01:14:58.573
in the Cliffkeep Mountains with a few of this
kind, you've seen a few fortresses, and from the

01:14:58.573 --> 01:15:04.123
details of it, the way of the roof, and the scope
of its design, and the way the mountain range

01:15:04.123 --> 01:15:08.827
lends itself to that type of topography, yeah.
This is obviously a stone giant fortress.

01:15:08.827 --> 01:15:12.886
TRAVIS: Oh, and I drank some of that nasty dank in
the fight with the Hammer, round two.

01:15:12.886 --> 01:15:15.012
SAM: Wait, should we-- those are bad guys, right?

01:15:15.012 --> 01:15:15.964
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's bad.

01:15:15.964 --> 01:15:16.986
SAM: We should not go that way.

01:15:16.986 --> 01:15:18.436
LAURA: We should definitely stay away from that.

01:15:18.436 --> 01:15:21.194
TRAVIS: Maybe go up on the other side of the chasm
opposite of it?

01:15:21.194 --> 01:15:22.713
MATT: Or you can move around the side, you're
welcome to.

01:15:22.713 --> 01:15:24.562
LAURA: Maybe hide and make sure we're
hidey-hidey?

01:15:24.562 --> 01:15:26.462
SAM: We could stealth through it, we could
invisible through it.

01:15:26.462 --> 01:15:27.718
MARISHA: Pass Without a Trace.

01:15:27.718 --> 01:15:28.581
TRAVIS: Pass Without a Trace.

01:15:28.581 --> 01:15:29.512
LAURA: I have Pass Without a Trace.

01:15:29.512 --> 01:15:30.829
TRAVIS: And climb along the opposite side.

01:15:30.829 --> 01:15:32.161
LAURA: And do we have invisibil--oh, no.

01:15:32.161 --> 01:15:33.368
TALIESIN: No, we don't, no.

01:15:33.368 --> 01:15:34.126
LAURA: You have--

01:15:34.126 --> 01:15:35.530
SAM: I have some invisibility. Not great, though.

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:38.752
TRAVIS: I have dust of tracelessness.

01:15:38.752 --> 01:15:39.756
LAURA: Maybe we'll stealth it.

01:15:39.756 --> 01:15:43.099
LIAM: Can I hide Scanlan under my cloak? Can he
use his invisibility on someone else?

01:15:43.099 --> 01:15:48.316
MATT: If he was to cast Invisibility on you--

01:15:48.316 --> 01:15:51.054
LIAM: No, on somebody else, so I'd just hide him.

01:15:51.054 --> 01:15:52.890
TRAVIS: What about one of those things that always
works on me--

01:15:52.890 --> 01:15:53.911
MATT: You could--

01:15:53.911 --> 01:15:55.048
TRAVIS: -- a diversion?

01:15:55.048 --> 01:15:58.057
MATT: You would move very slow and you would have
disadvantage on your stealth checks because you

01:15:58.057 --> 01:15:59.665
guys don't have a way to move quietly.

01:15:59.665 --> 01:16:00.485
LIAM: All right, all right.

01:16:00.485 --> 01:16:01.550
LAURA: No, I don't want to bring any attention.

01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:03.256
MARISHA: I could create a diversion.

01:16:03.256 --> 01:16:04.291
SAM: What kind?

01:16:04.291 --> 01:16:05.528
LAURA: Like what?

01:16:05.528 --> 01:16:12.372
MARISHA: I mean, I could-- What's nearby? Is
anything nearby? Any animals? Have we seen any

01:16:12.372 --> 01:16:13.649
wildlife?

01:16:13.649 --> 01:16:17.780
MATT: There have been birds that fly through, an
occasional harpy, in the distance you hear

01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:21.181
screeching and you guys keep quiet until it
vanishes and disappears.

01:16:21.181 --> 01:16:22.808
(screech in the background music)

01:16:22.808 --> 01:16:23.481
TALIESIN: Wow.

01:16:23.481 --> 01:16:24.581
TRAVIS: That was perfect timing!

01:16:24.581 --> 01:16:26.915
LAURA: How'd that happen? How did that frickin'
happen?

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:28.184
TRAVIS: His ways are mysterious, my love.

01:16:28.184 --> 01:16:29.422
LAURA: You are magic.

01:16:29.422 --> 01:16:30.896
MATT: I am lucky.

01:16:30.896 --> 01:16:32.827
TALIESIN: Holy cow.

01:16:32.827 --> 01:16:38.045
MATT: What were some seafaring like seagulls and
various coastal birds have slowly been

01:16:38.045 --> 01:16:43.790
disappearing and turning into more eagles and
hawks, things that eat small rodents, more of a

01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:47.581
lush side of the hill. You see as you get closer
to the valley itself that the actual forest that

01:16:47.581 --> 01:16:51.929
surrounds Whitestone is more and more of these
birds of prey are beginning to show up. Other than

01:16:51.929 --> 01:16:55.627
that, you see very few small things other than
occasional lizards about that big in your hand

01:16:55.627 --> 01:16:58.157
that live on hot rocks.

01:16:58.213 --> 01:17:03.314
TALIESIN: Should we observe this encampment for a
bit, just to see what's happening as we slowly

01:17:03.314 --> 01:17:04.396
make our way around it?

01:17:04.396 --> 01:17:05.889
LAURA: Can we see any kind of movement? It's
really far away, or--?

01:17:05.889 --> 01:17:06.700
TRAVIS: Couldn't hurt.

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:08.703
MATT: It's still a ways away right now, you're
just catching the edge of it.

01:17:08.703 --> 01:17:11.774
SAM: Are we a mile away? A thousand feet away?

01:17:11.774 --> 01:17:14.583
MATT: I'd say you're about a good 600, 700 feet
from it.

01:17:14.583 --> 01:17:16.536
LIAM: That's not that far.

01:17:16.536 --> 01:17:20.245
TRAVIS: You know, we could try to work our way up
the opposite side of the chasm.

01:17:20.245 --> 01:17:22.905
TALIESIN: That would also allow us a good view of
it as well.

01:17:22.905 --> 01:17:27.581
MARISHA: I happen to have Hallucinatory Terrain
right now.

01:17:27.581 --> 01:17:29.220
SAM: What does that even mean?

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:31.034
MARISHA: It means exactly what it sounds like.

01:17:31.034 --> 01:17:35.134
SAM: I don't speak your language.

01:17:35.134 --> 01:17:39.858
MARISHA: I can make terrain that's not real.

01:17:39.858 --> 01:17:42.298
LIAM: Do you remember when we psyched out the
duergar--

01:17:42.298 --> 01:17:44.545
SAM: It would block their view of us maybe?
Perhaps?

01:17:44.545 --> 01:17:45.768
LAURA: Is it movable?

01:17:45.768 --> 01:17:46.871
TRAVIS: Yeah, it can't move with us.

01:17:46.871 --> 01:17:48.063
MARISHA: It could block their view of us.

01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:49.405
LIAM: Can you make some shrubs to come along with
us?

01:17:49.405 --> 01:17:52.115
MATT: You guys actually used it previously to camp
for a night along a cliffside.

01:17:52.115 --> 01:17:52.914
LAURA: Right.

01:17:52.914 --> 01:17:54.824
MATT: And made the cliff extend further than it
was.

01:17:54.824 --> 01:17:58.534
LIAM: Yeah, we lured a bunch of duergar into a
chasm that the ground extended over.

01:17:58.534 --> 01:18:03.274
LAURA: Let's try to climb up the other side and
then see what we can see.

01:18:03.274 --> 01:18:06.963
MARISHA: I mean, I can do a lot of things, I can
make a thunderstorm, I can make a sleet storm.

01:18:06.963 --> 01:18:08.780
SAM: That would keep them in their fortress.

01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:10.097
TRAVIS: Could you make it fire?

01:18:10.097 --> 01:18:10.894
MARISHA: I could.

01:18:10.894 --> 01:18:11.659
TALIESIN: Or very cold if they came out.

01:18:11.659 --> 01:18:12.507
LAURA: They like cold.

01:18:12.507 --> 01:18:13.260
TALIESIN: Oh, yes.

01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:14.266
MARISHA: I could, I could make a big storm.

01:18:14.266 --> 01:18:19.385
TRAVIS: We're also on a chasm, so if it gets wet
and slippery and muddy we might all go down.

01:18:19.385 --> 01:18:20.306
TALIESIN: That's true.

01:18:20.306 --> 01:18:21.891
LAURA: Maybe get up at the top of it and then do
this.

01:18:21.891 --> 01:18:25.860
TALIESIN: I like the plan of going up the other
side of the chasm.

01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:26.964
LAURA: Can we try to climb the other side?

01:18:26.964 --> 01:18:27.826
MATT: Certainly.

01:18:27.826 --> 01:18:30.361
LIAM: Giants like to throw fucking boulders.

01:18:30.361 --> 01:18:31.821
LAURA: Yeah, I don't wanna be down on the bottom.

01:18:31.821 --> 01:18:33.039
LIAM: Yeah.

01:18:33.039 --> 01:18:36.518
MATT: As you guys make your way up the other side,
you're helping each other, I want everyone to go

01:18:36.518 --> 01:18:37.964
ahead and make an athletics check.

01:18:37.964 --> 01:18:40.950
SAM: I put on my climbing gear, which I definitely
own.

01:18:41.023 --> 01:18:42.222
MARISHA: An athletics check?

01:18:42.222 --> 01:18:43.353
MATT: Okay, giving you advantage on your athletics
check.

01:18:43.353 --> 01:18:44.854
LAURA: I actually own climbing gear too, does that
help?

01:18:44.854 --> 01:18:45.624
MATT: That would help you, yes.

01:18:45.624 --> 01:18:46.336
LAURA: Okay.

01:18:46.336 --> 01:18:47.762
TRAVIS: I have mine too, so I'll put that on as
well.

01:18:47.762 --> 01:18:49.081
MARISHA: I don't know if I have climbing--

01:18:49.081 --> 01:18:50.757
TALIESIN: I don't know if I have climbing gear.

01:18:50.757 --> 01:18:52.555
TRAVIS: Attached to a rope and a grappling hook
that's in my hand.

01:18:52.555 --> 01:18:54.700
SAM: And it was the same. (laughs)

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:56.117
MATT: All right. So.

01:18:56.117 --> 01:18:57.462
SAM: What am I doing? Adding what?

01:18:57.462 --> 01:18:58.544
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah! Nipple tits.

01:18:58.544 --> 01:19:01.642
MATT: You have advantage, you add your strength
modifier. Or your athletics is what it would be.

01:19:01.642 --> 01:19:02.512
SAM: Athletics.

01:19:02.512 --> 01:19:04.842
LAURA: Do we add anything because of the climbing
gear or is it?

01:19:04.842 --> 01:19:06.004
MATT: You get advantage because of the climbing
gear.

01:19:06.004 --> 01:19:06.626
LAURA: Ah, that's important.

01:19:06.626 --> 01:19:07.380
TRAVIS: 26.

01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:08.282
MATT: 26.

01:19:08.282 --> 01:19:09.355
LIAM: We were all using climbing gear or just--

01:19:09.355 --> 01:19:10.329
MATT: No, those who have it.

01:19:10.329 --> 01:19:13.788
LAURA: I give you my climbing gear because I
already get advantage. How about that? Does that

01:19:13.788 --> 01:19:14.808
count? No.

01:19:14.808 --> 01:19:16.495
MATT: Because it is mountain? All right, I'll let
you do that.

01:19:16.495 --> 01:19:17.621
LAURA: All right.

01:19:17.621 --> 01:19:18.633
LIAM: All right, well, I got 19.

01:19:18.633 --> 01:19:19.587
MATT: 19.

01:19:19.587 --> 01:19:20.435
LAURA: Oh, so you don't need that.

01:19:20.435 --> 01:19:21.263
LIAM: Yes I do, I need it.

01:19:21.263 --> 01:19:22.352
SAM: 11.

01:19:22.352 --> 01:19:23.112
TRAVIS: 26.

01:19:23.112 --> 01:19:24.375
MATT: 26. Vex, what did you get?

01:19:24.375 --> 01:19:25.489
LAURA: I got 15.

01:19:25.489 --> 01:19:26.554
MARISHA: 11.

01:19:26.554 --> 01:19:28.194
TALIESIN: 19.

01:19:28.194 --> 01:19:33.942
MATT: Okay. A couple of missteps and almost
sliding, Keyleth, at one point, you grasp her by

01:19:33.942 --> 01:19:36.622
the hand and Grog pulls her back up onto the
platform.

01:19:36.622 --> 01:19:37.951
TRAVIS: No, no, up here.

01:19:37.951 --> 01:19:38.837
MARISHA: Thanks, Grog.

01:19:38.837 --> 01:19:43.788
MATT: Over time, you guys make your way along this
very rocky and precarious, anywhere from five to

01:19:43.788 --> 01:19:48.325
three to two feet in width, sometimes even lesser
than that and you guys are having to shimmy

01:19:48.325 --> 01:19:54.657
across. You make your way around and you can see
this large fortress that is built out of extremely

01:19:54.657 --> 01:20:02.015
large and in-place stones and stonework. It looks
ancient. For size-wise, it's two stories for a

01:20:02.015 --> 01:20:05.843
giant, which means it's probably close to six or
seven stories of height.

01:20:05.843 --> 01:20:06.926
LAURA: Whoa.

01:20:06.926 --> 01:20:11.975
MATT: Built into the side of a mountain, and it
goes down almost like two giant steps. It's built

01:20:11.975 --> 01:20:18.783
on essentially where the giant bowl, the caldera
if you will, of where this valley of this mountain

01:20:18.783 --> 01:20:22.514
range would be. It's built on the inside of it, so
it's actually constructed, as you continue to descend

01:20:22.514 --> 01:20:29.534
into the valley. Looking at it, you can see
openings, windows, there are areas up top where

01:20:29.767 --> 01:20:33.953
you see giant piles of rocks and boulders that are
used for anti-siege, for throwing off the top,

01:20:33.953 --> 01:20:38.594
stockpiles of that. You do see boulders around the
ground that may have been thrown and not picked

01:20:38.594 --> 01:20:43.677
up. Everyone make a perception check.

01:20:44.985 --> 01:20:49.329
LAURA: I feel-- (whispers) Should I say?

01:20:49.329 --> 01:20:50.638
LIAM: (whispers) I'm not gonna tell you.

01:20:50.638 --> 01:20:51.270
TALIESIN: That's an intimidation check.

01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:52.812
LAURA: How did Trinket get up the cavern?

01:20:52.812 --> 01:20:53.486
MATT: Hm?

01:20:53.486 --> 01:20:54.278
LAURA: Can Trinket climb?

01:20:54.278 --> 01:20:54.953
MATT: Trinket--

01:20:54.953 --> 01:20:55.782
TALIESIN: Bears climb!

01:20:55.782 --> 01:20:56.727
MARISHA: Bears are good climbers.

01:20:56.727 --> 01:20:57.328
LAURA: They're good climbers?

01:20:57.328 --> 01:20:58.161
TALIESIN: They can get up a tree.

01:20:58.161 --> 01:20:58.772
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:20:58.772 --> 01:21:00.338
MATT: Roll an athletics check with disadvantage.

01:21:00.338 --> 01:21:02.113
SAM: Disadvantage.

01:21:02.113 --> 01:21:03.771
LAURA: I'm sorry! But it felt wrong to lie.

01:21:03.771 --> 01:21:04.343
MATT: Rangers.

01:21:04.343 --> 01:21:05.730
SAM: Of course. It's an honor system.

01:21:05.730 --> 01:21:09.186
LIAM: Could I have given the climbing gear to
Trinket?

01:21:09.186 --> 01:21:09.735
LAURA: No.

01:21:09.735 --> 01:21:10.475
TRAVIS: No.

01:21:10.475 --> 01:21:11.204
(all laugh)

01:21:11.204 --> 01:21:12.555
TALIESIN: You could've, it just would've been
adorable.

01:21:12.555 --> 01:21:14.463
LAURA: But we could tie the rope around Trinket's
waist.

01:21:14.463 --> 01:21:17.484
MATT: Roll your dice.

01:21:17.484 --> 01:21:18.887
LAURA: With an athletics check?

01:21:18.887 --> 01:21:19.792
MATT: Yes.

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:21.821
LAURA: Does he get an advantage because of
mountains?

01:21:21.821 --> 01:21:23.044
MARISHA: I love that he says 'roll your dice' like
it matters.

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:24.725
MATT: Nope. He gets disadvantage because he's a
big bear.

01:21:24.725 --> 01:21:26.279
TRAVIS: I told her not to say it, why'd you say
it?

01:21:26.279 --> 01:21:27.982
LAURA: I'm just trying to be honest!

01:21:27.982 --> 01:21:29.578
MATT: Which is appreciated.

01:21:29.578 --> 01:21:31.994
LAURA: Strength modifier? He got a 15, too.

01:21:31.994 --> 01:21:35.975
MATT: Okay. It's been difficult, and it slowed
your guys' progression, but you've managed to keep

01:21:35.975 --> 01:21:40.646
Trinket along with you; this large bear is now
like pushing against the side. He's managed to

01:21:40.646 --> 01:21:42.730
keep up, but it's been a harrowing experience.

01:21:42.730 --> 01:21:44.337
LIAM: I've been behind him the whole time, pushing
on his buttocks.

01:21:44.337 --> 01:21:45.582
MATT: Yeah.

01:21:45.582 --> 01:21:47.230
LAURA: You got this buddy, you got this.

01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:48.823
MATT: So, once again, perception rolls.

01:21:48.823 --> 01:21:49.784
LAURA: Sorry. Yes.

01:21:49.784 --> 01:21:50.687
TALIESIN: 20.

01:21:50.687 --> 01:21:51.364
MARISHA: 19.

01:21:51.364 --> 01:21:52.470
SAM: 17.

01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:54.018
LIAM: Can I use passive perception?

01:21:54.018 --> 01:21:57.274
MATT: This is active actually looking for
something; the passive is more--

01:21:57.274 --> 01:22:01.087
LIAM: Well then, I get-- 26.

01:22:01.087 --> 01:22:03.456
TRAVIS: 15.

01:22:03.456 --> 01:22:07.571
LAURA: 19.

01:22:07.571 --> 01:22:09.002
MATT: All right. You got 26, you said?

01:22:09.002 --> 01:22:09.664
LIAM: Yep.

01:22:09.664 --> 01:22:15.773
MATT: Looking from this distance, and keeping the
best visual you can see, there is no movement, at

01:22:15.845 --> 01:22:21.388
all, from the interior of the fortress. The two
front doors, you see these two large stone doors

01:22:21.388 --> 01:22:25.269
that are the entrance to it. One of the doors is
actually broken in half and left

01:22:25.269 --> 01:22:27.024
partially ajar and open.

01:22:27.024 --> 01:22:28.253
TRAVIS: We gotta go in now.

01:22:28.253 --> 01:22:28.904
LAURA: No, no, no.

01:22:28.904 --> 01:22:29.948
SAM: They could be dead in there.

01:22:29.948 --> 01:22:34.740
LAURA: If something could've taken out giant
giants. What could it be that could've done that?

01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:35.994
TRAVIS: Vampire giants.

01:22:35.994 --> 01:22:38.866
TALIESIN: It could've been the Briarwoods. We
should see everything that's up here.

01:22:38.866 --> 01:22:40.169
SAM: (sings) There are giants in the sky.

01:22:40.169 --> 01:22:41.439
TRAVIS: How awesome would that be?

01:22:41.439 --> 01:22:44.862
LAURA: (sings) There are big, tall, terrible
giants in the sky.

01:22:44.862 --> 01:22:46.786
TRAVIS: Can we please go see? Can someone
please--

01:22:46.786 --> 01:22:48.355
SAM: You want me to go in?

01:22:48.355 --> 01:22:49.157
TRAVIS: Vax!?

01:22:49.157 --> 01:22:50.653
MARISHA: I can bird it. I can bird it and go in.

01:22:50.653 --> 01:22:52.557
TALIESIN: I can't believe I'm about to say this.

01:22:52.557 --> 01:22:54.129
MARISHA: Bird in and do a recon mission real
quick?

01:22:54.129 --> 01:22:55.770
SAM: You're going to bird in? They're going to see
you fly in.

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:56.618
LAURA: No, but she's a bird.

01:22:56.618 --> 01:22:57.413
MARISHA: I'm a bird.

01:22:57.413 --> 01:22:58.538
SAM: It doesn't matter, they're still gonna see
you.

01:22:58.538 --> 01:22:59.404
LAURA: Recon it.

01:22:59.404 --> 01:23:00.587
MARISHA: I'll go bat!

01:23:00.587 --> 01:23:01.749
LAURA: Yeah!

01:23:01.749 --> 01:23:05.715
TALIESIN: Now you're not going to be able to see
anything because they have terrible eyesight.

01:23:05.715 --> 01:23:07.086
MARISHA: Not in a small--

01:23:07.086 --> 01:23:11.145
TALIESIN: I'm kidding, they really don't. That's a
myth! That's actually a myth!

01:23:11.145 --> 01:23:12.308
MARISHA: They have echo vision!

01:23:12.308 --> 01:23:15.130
TALIESIN: They have actually very reasonable
eyesight. That's a myth. You can look it up on

01:23:15.130 --> 01:23:16.517
Wikipedia, it's true.

01:23:16.517 --> 01:23:18.220
MARISHA: (laughs) Very reasonable eyesight.

01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:19.258
LIAM: You could also be a sparrow.

01:23:19.258 --> 01:23:20.599
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

01:23:20.599 --> 01:23:25.402
MATT: So, at about the two in the afternoon day
sun, 'cause that's what it is. But you're fine.

01:23:25.402 --> 01:23:26.895
You become a bat--

01:23:26.895 --> 01:23:28.050
MARISHA: Bats come out during the day!

01:23:28.050 --> 01:23:34.107
MATT: I know. She makes her way, down through; you
swoop up to one of the windows and you glance

01:23:34.107 --> 01:23:40.279
inside and look around. You can see most of the
furniture inside is in tatters. There are large,

01:23:40.279 --> 01:23:44.617
giant-sized tables and chairs that have been
broken in half and strewn across the room.

01:23:44.617 --> 01:23:46.722
Make a perception check.

01:23:46.722 --> 01:23:48.266
LAURA: Ooh, come on, Keyleth!

01:23:48.266 --> 01:23:49.361
SAM: Come on, oh yeah.

01:23:49.361 --> 01:23:50.401
TALIESIN: Oh yeah!

01:23:50.401 --> 01:23:51.442
MARISHA: Oh yeah! 28.

01:23:51.442 --> 01:23:53.515
MATT: 28. Glancing inside you also see there
are--

01:23:53.515 --> 01:23:55.228
MARISHA: (squawks) That's my echovision.

01:23:55.228 --> 01:24:00.467
MATT: -- splatters and puddles of blood. Large
bits of blood across the ground that is dried, but

01:24:00.467 --> 01:24:07.519
from your current vision from this, there is no
sign of any living or individuals or bodies. There

01:24:07.519 --> 01:24:13.090
was a battle that took place here, but there is
nothing present to signify who or what.

01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:14.774
MARISHA: How big is this room?

01:24:14.774 --> 01:24:20.074
MATT: This room is about 25 feet tall

01:24:20.074 --> 01:24:21.922
MARISHA: Does it look like it goes deeper?

01:24:21.922 --> 01:24:26.166
MATT: It does look like it goes deeper, there is a
slight-- this is the upper floor, there is a

01:24:26.166 --> 01:24:33.333
grade, almost like a slow-- the word escapes me
for a second.

01:24:33.333 --> 01:24:35.455
MARISHA: Like a downgrade.

01:24:35.455 --> 01:24:36.106
MATT: Yes.

01:24:36.106 --> 01:24:36.928
TALIESIN: Like a ramp.

01:24:36.928 --> 01:24:37.497
MATT: A ramp!

01:24:37.497 --> 01:24:38.109
SAM: A slope.

01:24:38.109 --> 01:24:38.854
MATT: Thank you.

01:24:38.854 --> 01:24:43.220
MATT: A ramp that disappears below and into the
lower floor.

01:24:43.532 --> 01:24:44.606
SAM: A siggle.

01:24:44.606 --> 01:24:45.747
MARISHA: I'm gonna go into that--

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:46.978
(all laugh)

01:24:46.978 --> 01:24:48.756
TRAVIS: Careful. Oh no no no no! Don't roll! Don't
roll!

01:24:48.756 --> 01:24:52.777
(all shout)

01:24:52.777 --> 01:24:53.986
TALIESIN: We turn on him.

01:24:53.986 --> 01:24:55.535
MARISHA: Fear of god.

01:24:55.535 --> 01:24:57.623
LIAM: Grog sacrifices the gnome.

01:24:57.623 --> 01:25:03.986
(all laugh)

01:25:03.986 --> 01:25:07.768
MATT: So yeah, you do see the ramp, that's
downward.

01:25:07.768 --> 01:25:10.897
MARISHA: I'm going to go into the room that I see
is for sure empty, and go

01:25:10.897 --> 01:25:13.149
toward the threshold of the ramp.

01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:17.907
MATT: Okay. Make your way down to the threshold of
the ramp, looking down. Downstairs as well, it

01:25:17.907 --> 01:25:22.524
looks like there are some fur rugs set aside that
have been kicked aside and bunched up on the edge

01:25:22.524 --> 01:25:23.970
of the room.

01:25:23.970 --> 01:25:27.128
MARISHA: Like it's been ransacked, or just a
really nasty fight?

01:25:27.128 --> 01:25:32.494
MATT: Like some sort of a major fight went down.
No sign of any bodies or body parts. No sign of

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:38.710
leftover weapons or armor from whatever giants
lived in here. You just see large amounts of dried

01:25:38.710 --> 01:25:42.695
blood across the stone floors.

01:25:42.695 --> 01:25:49.194
MARISHA: Like something came in and slaughtered
and completely stripped the place.

01:25:49.194 --> 01:25:52.653
MATT: Or the giants slaughtered something horribly
here and are currently out and about, you don't

01:25:52.653 --> 01:25:54.094
know. But--

01:25:54.094 --> 01:25:58.878
MARISHA: Can I tell if the blood looks-- how dusty
is this shit?

01:25:58.878 --> 01:26:01.406
MATT: Did you want to land and make an
investigation check?

01:26:01.406 --> 01:26:02.160
SAM: Call us in.

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:02.817
TRAVIS: Do it.

01:26:02.817 --> 01:26:04.183
LIAM: Do it, Batwoman.

01:26:04.183 --> 01:26:06.334
TALIESIN: You are the night.

01:26:06.334 --> 01:26:07.909
MARISHA: How much dust goes pff?

01:26:07.909 --> 01:26:09.130
TRAVIS: (laughs) You are the night.

01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:11.350
MATT: Quite a bit; a little puff.

01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:12.490
LAURA: Oh.

01:26:12.490 --> 01:26:17.058
MATT: Not a huge amount, but enough where it's not
fresh, and a closer look, the blood's been dry for

01:26:17.058 --> 01:26:19.111
a while. Make an investigation check.

01:26:19.111 --> 01:26:20.836
TALIESIN: What is the sound of a bat coughing?

01:26:20.836 --> 01:26:22.122
MARISHA: (squawking and coughing noise)

01:26:22.122 --> 01:26:26.138
TALIESIN: Thank you. It's the simple things.

01:26:26.138 --> 01:26:27.146
TRAVIS: What did you get?

01:26:27.146 --> 01:26:29.751
MARISHA: Investigation. What about a 12?

01:26:29.751 --> 01:26:35.560
MATT: 12. You can't really make it out,
unfortunately. You know it's dried, it's been a

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:38.814
little bit, but you can't quite gauge how long
it's been.

01:26:38.814 --> 01:26:44.993
MARISHA: All right, I'm gonna go ahead and-- are
there any other rooms, or is this it?

01:26:44.993 --> 01:26:48.722
MATT: There's the upper floor, the lower floor.
They're two large rooms on their own. It looks

01:26:48.722 --> 01:26:52.619
like-- You haven't actually gone down the grade
yet, so.

01:26:52.812 --> 01:26:57.689
MARISHA: You said seven stories, so it's like
room, downgrade, room, downgrade, room?

01:26:57.689 --> 01:27:01.526
MATT: Seven stories for your size, it's two
stories for a giant size. It's a large top room,

01:27:01.526 --> 01:27:02.673
and a large bottom room.

01:27:02.673 --> 01:27:03.485
LAURA: Ooh.

01:27:03.485 --> 01:27:05.724
MARISHA: Is there another room going off the
bottom room?

01:27:05.724 --> 01:27:09.468
MATT: There are just two rooms: top floor, bottom
floor. You're currently

01:27:09.468 --> 01:27:11.216
on the top floor, looking down.

01:27:11.216 --> 01:27:12.474
SAM: Split level condo.

01:27:12.474 --> 01:27:14.520
MARISH: I'm gonna go out to the front door.

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:15.207
MATT: Okay.

01:27:15.207 --> 01:27:24.929
MARISHA: Nice flat, upper east side. Land, and I'm
gonna bamf out of my bat form, and say, all right,

01:27:24.929 --> 01:27:26.843
it looks like the coast is clear if you guys want
to check this place out.

01:27:26.843 --> 01:27:27.789
SAM: Yeah, let's go check in.

01:27:27.789 --> 01:27:28.629
TALIESIN: Let's check it out.

01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:31.845
MATT: All right, the rest of you make you way back
down towards the front of the fortress and enter

01:27:31.845 --> 01:27:35.795
the inside. As you go through the front door, you
see that the impact that

01:27:35.795 --> 01:27:37.883
destroyed it was from the inside out.

01:27:37.883 --> 01:27:38.613
SAM: Oh!

01:27:38.613 --> 01:27:39.475
LAURA: Ooh.

01:27:39.475 --> 01:27:40.213
TRAVIS: Really?

01:27:40.213 --> 01:27:43.217
MATT: So it's not like it was beaten in, it was
beaten from the inside out.

01:27:43.217 --> 01:27:44.544
LAURA: Oh.

01:27:44.544 --> 01:27:49.364
MATT: And there is a streak of dried blood against
that portion of the door. Looking inside too, you

01:27:49.364 --> 01:27:57.388
see there are a large cluster of matted hides and
furs, like it made for bedding for close to four

01:27:57.388 --> 01:28:03.342
or five giants put in the corner, and there is a
musty smell of whatever they were using to make it

01:28:03.342 --> 01:28:08.433
comfortable and ripe for their own personal
needs.

01:28:08.433 --> 01:28:09.723
LIAM: Stealth!

01:28:09.723 --> 01:28:11.989
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, let's stealth.

01:28:11.989 --> 01:28:13.501
TRAVIS: Can giants become vampires?

01:28:13.501 --> 01:28:18.661
LAURA: I don't know, I hope not. You should use
the dust of tracelessness, Grog, just so our

01:28:18.661 --> 01:28:19.509
footsteps aren't seen.

01:28:19.509 --> 01:28:20.469
LIAM: 17.

01:28:20.469 --> 01:28:21.975
MATT: 17, okay. So what do you guys want to do in
here?

01:28:21.975 --> 01:28:22.894
LAURA: Stealth.

01:28:22.894 --> 01:28:23.772
SAM: I'm going to go downstairs.

01:28:23.772 --> 01:28:25.253
MARISHA: How dark is it?

01:28:25.253 --> 01:28:26.328
MATT: You are downstairs at the entrance

01:28:26.328 --> 01:28:27.767
SAM: Oh. Down the grade, I mean.

01:28:27.767 --> 01:28:31.569
TRAVIS: I want to look for any weapons that are
lying about.

01:28:31.808 --> 01:28:33.840
MATT: All right, make a perception check.

01:28:33.921 --> 01:28:34.863
LIAM: I want to ransack the joint.

01:28:34.863 --> 01:28:36.506
MATT: Actually, it'd be more of an investigation
check.

01:28:36.506 --> 01:28:38.319
TRAVIS: Me, investigate? That's funny. Eight.

01:28:38.319 --> 01:28:39.267
MATT: Okay.

01:28:39.267 --> 01:28:41.243
LIAM: Investigate or perception for me?

01:28:41.243 --> 01:28:42.342
TRAVIS: I find dirt.

01:28:42.342 --> 01:28:44.374
MATT: You find a giant's fortress.

01:28:44.374 --> 01:28:47.132
LIAM: Investigate or perception?

01:28:47.132 --> 01:28:51.728
MATT: For this? Perception is just seeing things
at first glance. Investigation is going through

01:28:51.728 --> 01:28:53.567
and rummaging through to find things.

01:28:53.567 --> 01:28:54.519
LIAM: I'll investigate.

01:28:54.519 --> 01:28:55.508
MATT: Okay.

01:28:55.508 --> 01:28:57.615
SAM: Shall I for downstairs?

01:28:57.615 --> 01:28:59.081
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

01:28:59.081 --> 01:29:02.245
LIAM: 17.

01:29:02.245 --> 01:29:03.576
SAM: 23.

01:29:03.576 --> 01:29:09.761
MATT: Okay. As you guys are going through, looking
at the blood and the way the splashes are, the

01:29:09.761 --> 01:29:14.245
blood that was spilled here was very thick, and
large amounts of it, and it's probably been

01:29:14.245 --> 01:29:20.614
anywhere from two to three months since this
entire fortress was ransacked.

01:29:20.614 --> 01:29:21.784
TRAVIS: Wow.

01:29:21.784 --> 01:29:26.550
MATT You do notice that some of the blood is
dragged through, like something was dragged

01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:33.789
out of the puddle. But not for a long
distance. Whatever was there was cleaned off at

01:29:34.043 --> 01:29:37.123
some point, or lifted up and carried out from
whatever was originally pulled through those

01:29:37.123 --> 01:29:46.377
puddles of blood. You also do notice that in the
pile of furs and refuse and there are bones of

01:29:46.377 --> 01:29:53.826
things that were left there to rot in the corner.
You find roughly 120 gold pieces.

01:29:53.826 --> 01:29:55.498
SAM: I give it to Vex.

01:29:55.498 --> 01:29:58.796
MATT: Over time you find a number of shattered
glass vials that look like they once contained

01:29:58.796 --> 01:30:02.256
various elixirs, there is one that is unshattered.

01:30:02.256 --> 01:30:03.775
SAM: I take it.

01:30:03.829 --> 01:30:10.612
MATT: All right. And underneath all, covered in
quite a bit of filth, but a little bit of metallic

01:30:10.612 --> 01:30:15.954
sheen streaks through, you see what looks to be
a very, very well-crafted longbow.

01:30:16.133 --> 01:30:19.828
LAURA: (gasps) What is that?! What is it? What did
you find?

01:30:19.828 --> 01:30:20.607
SAM: Nothing, nothing.

01:30:20.607 --> 01:30:21.942
LAURA: What is it? What is that?

01:30:21.942 --> 01:30:23.094
LIAM: Here you go

01:30:23.094 --> 01:30:24.201
LAURA: Ah, what is this?

01:30:24.201 --> 01:30:25.306
LIAM: What are you going to do with it?

01:30:25.306 --> 01:30:25.944
LAURA: What is this?

01:30:25.944 --> 01:30:27.252
SAM: I'll use it as a hammock.

01:30:27.252 --> 01:30:28.472
LIAM: Shoot yourself?

01:30:28.472 --> 01:30:29.872
MARISHA: Does it look like it's magic-y?

01:30:29.872 --> 01:30:31.266
LAURA: Can I tell what it is?

01:30:31.266 --> 01:30:39.284
MATT: Taking it, it appears to have some sort of
magical radiance to it. It looks like it's very

01:30:39.342 --> 01:30:43.513
well crafted. You recognize the construction is
elvish in nature.

01:30:43.513 --> 01:30:45.803
LAURA: Hey, look at this.

01:30:45.803 --> 01:30:51.074
MATT: And there are bits of mithril scrolling all
throughout the bow itself, with platinum caps on

01:30:51.074 --> 01:30:52.684
the edge of the longbow.

01:30:52.684 --> 01:30:54.291
TRAVIS: Is it evil?

01:30:54.291 --> 01:30:58.361
LAURA: I don't know. Keyleth, do you know anything
about magic-y stuff? Tiberius bamfed out.

01:30:58.361 --> 01:31:02.516
MARISHA: I can try, I'm not as good as he is, but
I'll try.

01:31:02.516 --> 01:31:04.336
LAURA: What about you, Scanlan? Do you know
anything about arcana?

01:31:04.336 --> 01:31:05.719
MARISHA: Ooh, 20!

01:31:05.719 --> 01:31:06.809
MATT: Natural 20?

01:31:06.809 --> 01:31:08.547
MARISHA: No, 18; 20 total.

01:31:08.547 --> 01:31:15.329
MATT: Yes, this is definitively a magical item, it
is enchanted.

01:31:15.329 --> 01:31:17.127
MARISHA: It's definitely magical.

01:31:17.127 --> 01:31:20.732
MATT: If you want to take a short time to work
with it and attune yourself to it, you could get a

01:31:20.732 --> 01:31:22.529
better idea of what its effect is.

01:31:22.529 --> 01:31:24.199
LAURA: Okay. Thank you. Can we do that?

01:31:24.199 --> 01:31:25.786
TALIESIN: I'm going to look around a bit more,
anyway.

01:31:25.786 --> 01:31:28.077
LAURA: I'm going to think about it real hard.

01:31:28.077 --> 01:31:29.980
LIAM: Probably shoot a couple dummy arrows out of
it

01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:31.200
TRAVIS: Can I walk out the front door?

01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:33.636
LAURA: I'm going to buy it a steak and I'm going
to--

01:31:33.636 --> 01:31:38.144
TRAVIS: Can I walk out the front door and keep
post on the porch?

01:31:38.144 --> 01:31:40.087
LIAM: I'm following Grog and I'm doing the same.

01:31:40.087 --> 01:31:40.810
MATT: All right.

01:31:40.810 --> 01:31:42.534
TRAVIS: And I want to look in the direction we
want to be walking.

01:31:42.534 --> 01:31:44.957
TALIESIN: I'm looking around, I'm trying to find
out what happened to the bodies.

01:31:44.957 --> 01:31:48.710
MATT: Investigation check for that.

01:31:48.773 --> 01:31:52.959
Here are the potion and the bow you guys
managed to--

01:31:52.959 --> 01:31:53.895
LAURA: What is it, what is it?

01:31:53.895 --> 01:31:55.326
SAM: I took the potion, I took the potion!

01:31:55.326 --> 01:31:57.124
MATT: (laughs) Give that to Scanlan.

01:31:57.124 --> 01:32:03.064
TALIESIN: I know, apparently, from this roll that
I'm in the mountains.

01:32:03.064 --> 01:32:04.182
LAURA: What is it?

01:32:04.182 --> 01:32:05.507
TALIESIN: I got a six.

01:32:05.507 --> 01:32:13.034
MATT: A six. It's hard to tell. It's a very
strange scene, and you have no inclination as to

01:32:13.034 --> 01:32:16.894
what may have transpired here. Who is the winner,
who is the loser, and

01:32:16.894 --> 01:32:19.644
what has been done with the bodies.

01:32:19.644 --> 01:32:20.694
LIAM: Sorry.

01:32:20.694 --> 01:32:21.820
MARISHA: What did you find, what did you find?

01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:22.882
TALIESIN: Vex is making happy noises.

01:32:22.882 --> 01:32:25.883
LIAM: She's taking the bow for a spin.

01:32:25.883 --> 01:32:26.883
TRAVIS: She's attuning.

01:32:26.883 --> 01:32:28.434
LIAM: Seeing what it can do.

01:32:28.434 --> 01:32:29.991
TRAVIS: Do we see anything outside on the porch?

01:32:29.991 --> 01:32:37.312
MATT: Over time the only thing you catch is occasionally
you see flocks of birds moving through and

01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:49.470
swooping through the area. You watch one flock
come up and begin circling a little bit.

01:32:50.059 --> 01:32:51.384
LAURA: Should we get out? Should we leave?

01:32:51.384 --> 01:32:52.180
MATT: And then make its way down toward the
valley.

01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:52.903
TRAVIS: Stealth.

01:32:52.903 --> 01:32:55.006
LAURA: Just leave. Let's leave. Stealth it out?
Stealthy out-ie?

01:32:55.006 --> 01:32:57.208
MATT: This is for Grog who is outside, roll a
stealth check.

01:32:57.208 --> 01:32:59.751
LIAM: I'm out there too, and I rolled a natural
20.

01:32:59.751 --> 01:33:01.318
MATT: Yes you did.

01:33:01.318 --> 01:33:03.396
TRAVIS: I might use your inspiration on this.

01:33:03.396 --> 01:33:05.876
SAM: It's probably not in effect anymore.

01:33:05.876 --> 01:33:07.488
LAURA: (groans) No, you're in the mountains!

01:33:07.488 --> 01:33:09.006
TRAVIS: I am in the mountains.

01:33:09.006 --> 01:33:11.882
MATT: Which means you have knowledge of
mountains.

01:33:11.882 --> 01:33:12.739
LAURA: You don't get advantage?

01:33:12.739 --> 01:33:13.945
TRAVIS: I don't have advantage on--

01:33:13.945 --> 01:33:19.986
MATT: Let me double-check on this, actually, what
the specifics of the goliath's-- You don't take

01:33:19.986 --> 01:33:25.312
issues with cold climates, because you're at high
elevation. You don't actually get advantage on

01:33:25.312 --> 01:33:27.059
anything mountain-wise; that is a ranger ability.

01:33:27.059 --> 01:33:29.696
TRAVIS: So can I add an inspiration on this?

01:33:29.696 --> 01:33:32.623
SAM: I inspired him quite a while ago. How long
does that--

01:33:32.623 --> 01:33:34.252
MATT: It's been a while, how long does that last?

01:33:34.252 --> 01:33:35.292
SAM: 20 minutes?

01:33:35.292 --> 01:33:36.404
MATT: Yeah, that would've faded by now.

01:33:36.404 --> 01:33:37.385
TRAVIS: That's a one.

01:33:37.385 --> 01:33:38.754
MATT: Oh, well, if it's a natural one it wouldn't
have mattered.

01:33:38.754 --> 01:33:40.663
LIAM: Yeah, it doesn't matter, you can't add shit
to one.

01:33:40.663 --> 01:33:45.707
MATT: So while you sneak off to the side, you see
these birds. There's a lot of birds there! You

01:33:45.707 --> 01:33:48.352
start yelling out to everyone, there's a lot of
birds out here!

01:33:48.352 --> 01:33:50.068
Shouting it loudly back into the fortress.

01:33:50.068 --> 01:33:51.061
LAURA: Aw, shit.

01:33:51.061 --> 01:33:55.122
MARISHA: Grog, Grog, those might be centurion
birds!

01:33:55.122 --> 01:33:57.278
TRAVIS: (loudly) That's what I said, birds!

01:33:57.278 --> 01:33:59.556
MARISHA: They might be spies! They might be
spies.

01:33:59.556 --> 01:34:04.017
TRAVIS: (loudly) Yeah, I spy birds, they're flying
everywhere. (yells) Go away!

01:34:04.017 --> 01:34:05.244
LAURA: Grog, Grog, inside.

01:34:05.244 --> 01:34:06.531
MARISHA: Inside!

01:34:06.531 --> 01:34:10.410
MATT: The birds immediately start circling the
fortress very close. You can hear the screeching.

01:34:10.410 --> 01:34:15.893
You can see the birds now, they're crows. A very,
very thick murder of crows, probably close to a

01:34:15.893 --> 01:34:17.232
hundred of them, cawing.

01:34:17.232 --> 01:34:19.181
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace.

01:34:19.181 --> 01:34:20.850
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait.

01:34:20.850 --> 01:34:24.482
SAM: I'm still down there, investigating.

01:34:24.482 --> 01:34:25.678
MATT: Mm-hm.

01:34:25.678 --> 01:34:31.368
SAM: I pull a David Caruso and say, It looks like
these giants had... big trouble.

01:34:31.368 --> 01:34:35.148
(all laugh)

01:34:35.148 --> 01:34:42.556
MATT: You hear an echoing sound, yeahhhh!
Formless, sourceless. You all stand there confused

01:34:42.556 --> 01:34:44.333
for a moment, then continue to try and stealth.

01:34:44.333 --> 01:34:45.400
TRAVIS: I run back inside.

01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:51.996
MATT: Back inside. Eventually the crows take back
to their original path.

01:34:51.996 --> 01:34:56.592
MARISHA: Oh, oh, but before the crows leave,
before the crows leave--

01:34:56.592 --> 01:34:57.259
LIAM: Yeah?

01:34:57.259 --> 01:34:57.878
LAURA: Yeah?

01:34:57.878 --> 01:34:58.702
MARISHA: Can I do something?

01:34:58.702 --> 01:34:59.300
MATT: Yep. What are you doing?

01:34:59.300 --> 01:34:59.788
LAURA: Do it!

01:34:59.788 --> 01:35:00.457
TRAVIS: Do it!

01:35:00.457 --> 01:35:01.554
SAM: Kill them all.

01:35:01.739 --> 01:35:06.123
MARISHA: I'm gonna go like Storm and I'm gonna
Sleet Storm them. I'm gonna start conjuring a

01:35:06.123 --> 01:35:08.582
Sleet Storm over the top of this mountain, right
where the crows are.

01:35:08.582 --> 01:35:11.063
TALIESIN: It's been so long since you've killed
something innocent! Let's bring it!

01:35:11.063 --> 01:35:12.493
LAURA: Do it, do it, Keyleth!

01:35:12.493 --> 01:35:15.748
MATT: As Keyleth concentrates for a second, you
see her eyes, the actual color of her irises,

01:35:15.748 --> 01:35:21.129
begin to fade to this cloudy white and then the
entire eye itself becomes this icy blue. A slight

01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:26.672
cold mist beginning to drift off the corners of
her face.

01:35:26.672 --> 01:35:27.756
LAURA: Badass.

01:35:27.756 --> 01:35:31.791
MATT: You start hearing this pounding sound on the
top of the fortress as sleet and hail begins to

01:35:31.791 --> 01:35:36.218
rain down. Go ahead and roll damage for the
spell.

01:35:37.836 --> 01:35:40.700
MARISHA: Oh, jeez.

01:35:43.826 --> 01:35:57.371
MATT: Sleet Storm? Oh, it's just a dexterity
saving throw. It says heavily obscured, but

01:35:57.371 --> 01:35:59.970
doesn't actually do any damage.

01:35:59.970 --> 01:36:01.535
LAURA: But it knocks them all down.

01:36:01.535 --> 01:36:04.897
MARISHA: I know, they're like frozen though,
right? Don't they get frozen with Sleet Storm?

01:36:04.897 --> 01:36:09.890
MATT: Sleet Storm knocks things prone, makes the
area hard to see.

01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:11.026
MARISHA: Knocks them prone

01:36:11.026 --> 01:36:11.966
MATT: Douses flames.

01:36:11.966 --> 01:36:15.067
MARISHA: They're in the sky, I wanna hear birds
hit the floor.

01:36:15.067 --> 01:36:18.875
MATT: And a few do. There are a few birds that get
pelted and knocked to the ground, encased in

01:36:18.875 --> 01:36:23.109
sleet, but most of it immediately takes note to
get away from the storm and vanish

01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:24.596
and disappear back to--

01:36:24.596 --> 01:36:26.343
TRAVIS: Do they fall to the porch?

01:36:26.343 --> 01:36:27.628
MATT: I'll say one does.

01:36:27.628 --> 01:36:28.793
TRAVIS: I run out there and I grab it.

01:36:28.793 --> 01:36:30.991
LAURA: No, no, no!

01:36:30.991 --> 01:36:32.445
TRAVIS: I rip its head off with my teeth.

01:36:32.445 --> 01:36:34.687
(all laugh)

01:36:34.687 --> 01:36:37.997
MATT: Grog, you run out there and grab the one on
the ground, it's struggling, and (squawks),

01:36:37.997 --> 01:36:39.075
there's ice gathered everywhere.

01:36:39.075 --> 01:36:40.175
TRAVIS: Yeah, shut up!

01:36:40.175 --> 01:36:47.445
MATT: You grab it and you pick it up, you hear Vex
go "Grog!" and you go (chomp) as she's staring at

01:36:47.445 --> 01:37:00.225
you. Silencing the crow. You hear the cawing of
the crows dissipate in the distance and silence

01:37:00.342 --> 01:37:03.654
eventually takes the fortress once again, and
you're left amongst the smell of death.

01:37:03.654 --> 01:37:04.826
LAURA: We should get the eff out of here.

01:37:04.826 --> 01:37:05.539
MARISHA: I think so.

01:37:05.539 --> 01:37:06.367
TALIESIN: We should probably leave.

01:37:06.367 --> 01:37:07.931
LAURA: Now. Stealth and out.

01:37:07.931 --> 01:37:11.216
LAURA: Dust of tracelessness. Hide ourselves.

01:37:11.216 --> 01:37:12.596
TRAVIS: Dust of tracelessness.

01:37:12.596 --> 01:37:19.252
MATT: You make your way out of the fortress and
begin to follow the path down into the outside of

01:37:19.252 --> 01:37:26.782
the forest and just as you make towards the base
of the mountains where the forest canopy begins to

01:37:26.782 --> 01:37:34.590
take your vision, you can see just over the edge,
a couple of small castle towers and what looks to

01:37:34.590 --> 01:37:37.371
be a single central spire of the castle of
Whitestone.

01:37:37.371 --> 01:37:39.080
LAURA: They know we're here now. They know we're
here.

01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:40.598
LIAM: Yeah.

01:37:40.657 --> 01:37:41.683
TALIESIN: I think they might.

01:37:41.683 --> 01:37:42.568
LAURA: That was a sentry.

01:37:42.568 --> 01:37:43.557
TRAVIS: Why? They were just birds.

01:37:43.557 --> 01:37:44.718
MARISHA: Yeah, but we don't know--

01:37:44.718 --> 01:37:51.837
SAM: Don't worry, we still have the element of
surprise. Oh wait, no, we don't.

01:37:51.837 --> 01:37:57.947
MATT: And with that, we're going to go ahead and
take a break. All right, guys, we'll be back here

01:37:57.947 --> 01:38:00.397
in about 20-25 minutes.

01:38:00.397 --> 01:38:02.420
LAURA: Oh yeah!

01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:03.927
MATT: Let us begin where we left off.

01:38:03.927 --> 01:38:07.855
LAURA: Oh, we're looking at the city.

01:38:07.855 --> 01:38:13.797
SAM: There's the city! Shall we storm it?

01:38:13.797 --> 01:38:15.291
TALIESIN: It's a chalkboard.

01:38:15.291 --> 01:38:16.435
LAURA: I was pointing at you!

01:38:16.435 --> 01:38:21.879
TALIESIN: Well yes, so I can now recognize where
we are.

01:38:21.879 --> 01:38:29.859
MATT: Yes, you know this area very well. This
entire forested area, the Parchwood Forest that

01:38:29.859 --> 01:38:36.608
encompases the entirety of this valley, toward the
center of it, center north, is where Whitestone

01:38:36.608 --> 01:38:40.359
sits and for your reference as well, since you've
been here before,

01:38:40.359 --> 01:38:42.713
you would know the city relatively well.

01:38:42.713 --> 01:38:43.747
SAM: Maps!

01:38:43.747 --> 01:38:50.162
TALIESIN: This is the most exciting map I've ever
been handed. Whoa!

01:38:50.162 --> 01:38:54.071
LAURA: What the what?!

01:38:54.071 --> 01:38:56.981
MATT: Hold that over by your seat there for people
to take a look at.

01:38:56.981 --> 01:38:58.707
SAM: Don't. Just don't.

01:38:58.707 --> 01:39:01.872
TALIESIN: It won't fit in my folder.

01:39:01.872 --> 01:39:06.979
MATT: That is a basic rundown of the size, design
and shape of Whitestone, with Castle Whitestone

01:39:06.979 --> 01:39:13.132
toward the top, built on top of a leveled off
mountain that marks the southernmost point.

01:39:13.132 --> 01:39:14.657
SAM: This is the castle, this is the town?

01:39:14.657 --> 01:39:16.338
TRAVIS: And we're at the southern part of that?

01:39:16.338 --> 01:39:22.447
MATT: You guys are actually coming in from what
would be the northwestern side of the city

01:39:22.447 --> 01:39:24.174
MARISHA: So over here?

01:39:24.174 --> 01:39:28.726
MATT: A little bit further down. About that angle
there. That's the direction

01:39:28.726 --> 01:39:30.090
you're coming in from.

01:39:30.090 --> 01:39:32.665
TRAVIS: That's a detailed map, man.

01:39:32.665 --> 01:39:34.218
MATT: I don't have any free time anymore.

01:39:34.218 --> 01:39:36.724
(all laugh)

01:39:36.724 --> 01:39:37.932
TRAVIS: They sell those stock, right?

01:39:37.932 --> 01:39:39.048
MATT: Oh yeah, totally.

01:39:39.048 --> 01:39:41.921
TALIESIN: What's this little outcropping?

01:39:41.921 --> 01:39:48.449
MAT: The little outcropping to the east of it was
the graveyard to Whitestone. It's where most of

01:39:48.449 --> 01:39:53.579
the regular denizens were interred. It's been
expanded over the years as the city itself has

01:39:53.579 --> 01:39:56.484
been around for quite a few generations.

01:39:56.484 --> 01:40:02.555
MARISHA: Does this graveyard have catacombs?
Tombs? Underground passages?

01:40:02.555 --> 01:40:05.594
MATT: Do you ask this of Percy?

01:40:05.594 --> 01:40:07.033
MARISHA: Yes.

01:40:07.033 --> 01:40:07.897
TALIESIN: Does it?

01:40:07.897 --> 01:40:09.751
MATT: That graveyard does not--
TALIESIN: That graveyard does not--

01:40:09.751 --> 01:40:12.197
MATT: -- it is a surface graveyard.
TALIESIN: -- it is a surface graveyard.

01:40:12.197 --> 01:40:14.727
MATT: There is a mausoleum--
TALIESIN: There is a mausoleum--

01:40:14.727 --> 01:40:16.229
MATT: -- but that--
TALIESIN: -- but that--

01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:19.291
MATT: -- is actually contained beneath the castle.
TALIESIN: -- is actually contained beneath the castle.

01:40:19.291 --> 01:40:22.293
(all laugh)

01:40:22.293 --> 01:40:23.207
TRAVIS: Riveting.

01:40:23.207 --> 01:40:26.064
SAM: So knowledgeable, Percy.

01:40:26.064 --> 01:40:30.745
LAURA: So Percy, do you know of any secret
passages to get actually into the castle?

01:40:30.745 --> 01:40:32.603
TALIESIN: I was wondering that myself.

01:40:32.603 --> 01:40:34.405
MATT: There is one, one that you took to escape.

01:40:34.405 --> 01:40:35.649
TALIESIN: Yes, there is one!

01:40:35.649 --> 01:40:40.235
MARISHA: (laughs) Stop.

01:40:40.235 --> 01:40:53.595
MATT: He has an aneurysm. Yeah, it is to the very
western edge of the mountain precipice the castle

01:40:53.595 --> 01:40:59.449
was built on. It was built to be specifically an
escape in case the place was under siege.

01:40:59.449 --> 01:41:03.330
Unfortunately, the circumstances that the evening
happened so rapidly, and with creatures that

01:41:03.388 --> 01:41:10.651
seemingly were unnatural, the family didn't have
time to make it out. And even you weren't fully

01:41:10.651 --> 01:41:14.977
aware of it. Cassandra, however, had overheard
discussions about the passage and took that as your

01:41:14.977 --> 01:41:21.319
escape route. It's a hidden tunnel at the very
base of the mountain.

01:41:21.936 --> 01:41:30.244
TALIESIN: I say we scope out the hidden entrance,
see if it's guarded,

01:41:30.244 --> 01:41:32.273
see if they've discovered it.

01:41:32.273 --> 01:41:36.059
SAM: To the town, or to the castle?

01:41:36.059 --> 01:41:41.176
TALIESIN: The hidden entrance to the castle.
Instead of using it, I think we should possibly

01:41:41.176 --> 01:41:46.443
spend the night and get a view of the town, see if
there's anything unusual.

01:41:46.443 --> 01:41:48.516
LAURA: I agree, can we camp out and hide?

01:41:48.516 --> 01:41:51.658
SAM: Watch from afar? What's that going to tell
us?

01:41:51.658 --> 01:41:53.446
TRAVIS: We could send one in.

01:41:53.446 --> 01:41:56.286
TALIESIN: We could send a bird in. Or an invisible
gnome.

01:41:56.286 --> 01:41:58.921
SAM: Or both.

01:41:58.921 --> 01:42:01.985
TALIESIN: Or both. An invisible bird-gnome.

01:42:01.985 --> 01:42:07.025
TRAVIS: Just to see if the town is normal or not.

01:42:07.025 --> 01:42:10.386
SAM: It could be all vampires. Or it could be a
totally normal town.

01:42:10.386 --> 01:42:13.618
TALIESIN: If it's all vampires, it'll be empty
right now.

01:42:13.618 --> 01:42:15.880
SAM and LAURA: Because it's daytime.

01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:17.097
MARISHA: We should do a fly-by.

01:42:17.097 --> 01:42:19.154
LAURA: We should definitely attack during the
day.

01:42:19.154 --> 01:42:20.047
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:42:20.047 --> 01:42:21.851
TRAVIS: We should send one by air and one by
land.

01:42:21.851 --> 01:42:23.088
LAURA: What?

01:42:23.088 --> 01:42:24.388
MARISHA: Do you want to do that?

01:42:24.388 --> 01:42:25.289
SAM: How far away are we?

01:42:25.289 --> 01:42:28.692
MATT: You guys have been travelling through the
forest, and it is a very dense forest, but it is

01:42:28.692 --> 01:42:38.968
mostly cold-weather trees, pines. And there is,
you can see once you get inside the forest, the

01:42:38.968 --> 01:42:46.850
ground itself is very thick and there are elements
of melting snow on the top of the trees, there was

01:42:46.850 --> 01:42:52.244
recently a snowfall in this area but it seems like
it's been a while and most of it has turned to slush

01:42:52.244 --> 01:43:04.854
and water. You have about two hours of travel into
the forest, and you all immediately catch the

01:43:04.930 --> 01:43:07.595
sound of distant howling.

01:43:11.421 --> 01:43:12.652
SAM: Is it nighttime?

01:43:12.652 --> 01:43:13.919
MATT: No.

01:43:13.919 --> 01:43:15.217
SAM: Oh. That's scary.

01:43:15.217 --> 01:43:18.138
MARISHA: Distant howling? Does it sound like
wolves? Can I make a nature check?

01:43:18.138 --> 01:43:19.909
MATT: Yeah, make a nature check.

01:43:19.909 --> 01:43:21.201
LAURA: Stealth?

01:43:21.201 --> 01:43:23.668
MATT: If you want to make a stealth check

01:43:23.668 --> 01:43:28.273
MARISHA: 26.

01:43:28.273 --> 01:43:33.224
MATT: 26. Those are wolves. It sounds like a pack
of wolves, probably close to

01:43:33.224 --> 01:43:34.828
anywhere from five or six.

01:43:34.828 --> 01:43:38.304
MARISHA: Would I think it's weird that they're
howling during the daytime?

01:43:38.304 --> 01:43:42.418
MATT: You gather that it is strange that they're
out. Though it is getting later in the day, you

01:43:42.418 --> 01:43:50.712
are pushing four or five in the afternoon, the sun
is starting to get closer to the horizon. It is

01:43:50.712 --> 01:43:56.440
strange that they're out this early, you're not
sure what the reasoning would be for that.

01:43:57.502 --> 01:43:58.744
MARISHA: Odd.

01:43:58.744 --> 01:44:00.597
TALIESIN: I say we hide in the trees.

01:44:00.597 --> 01:44:01.343
LAURA: Up high.

01:44:01.343 --> 01:44:02.294
TRAVIS: Like up in the trees?

01:44:02.294 --> 01:44:04.331
LAURA: I like it.

01:44:04.331 --> 01:44:06.388
TRAVIS: We're gonna climb some trees.

01:44:06.388 --> 01:44:07.803
MATT: Okay.

01:44:07.803 --> 01:44:08.887
LIAM: We're gonna Hobbit this shit.

01:44:08.887 --> 01:44:11.251
SAM: We're just hiding in the trees, we're not
going in to investigate?

01:44:11.251 --> 01:44:13.785
TALIESIN: Well, it's about to be nighttime, so
we'll send a scout.

01:44:13.785 --> 01:44:17.256
SAM: How long would it take to get into the town
from where we are?

01:44:17.256 --> 01:44:19.103
MATT: About two more hours of travel.

01:44:19.103 --> 01:44:23.839
SAM: Ew. We'll get there at night. That's all
right though, it's early evening.

01:44:23.839 --> 01:44:26.661
MARISHA: How long would it take me to fly over if
I was a bird?

01:44:26.661 --> 01:44:27.997
MATT: About an hour.

01:44:27.997 --> 01:44:29.295
SAM: Vax.

01:44:29.295 --> 01:44:31.607
LIAM: Yes?

01:44:31.607 --> 01:44:34.762
SAM: Can I ride you into town?

01:44:34.762 --> 01:44:37.161
LIAM: You want me to jog into town?

01:44:37.161 --> 01:44:38.815
MARISHA: You could ride me into town.

01:44:38.815 --> 01:44:40.168
SAM: Well hello lady.

01:44:40.168 --> 01:44:42.833
MARISHA: Man, every time, Scanlan, every time.

01:44:42.833 --> 01:44:44.713
TALIESIN: Now that just got weird.

01:44:44.713 --> 01:44:47.170
LAURA: Could you turn yourself and fly?

01:44:47.170 --> 01:44:48.501
SAM: Yeah, I guess I could fly.

01:44:48.501 --> 01:44:52.121
MARISHA: You wanna go invisible and jump on my
back and I can eagle up?

01:44:52.121 --> 01:44:56.240
SAM: Whatever you're into, baby. (laughs) I've
become Austin Powers.

01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:58.321
LAURA: Ridiculous.

01:44:58.321 --> 01:45:00.228
MARISHA: Let's do it.

01:45:00.228 --> 01:45:03.760
LIAM: If the coach driver was any indication,
there are going to be people--

01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:04.793
LAURA: Normal people.

01:45:04.793 --> 01:45:05.815
LIAM: -- in town.

01:45:05.815 --> 01:45:08.990
SAM: What about this: I'll make us both invisible
and you fly us in.

01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:10.865
LAURA: I like it.

01:45:10.865 --> 01:45:13.034
TRAVIS: Yeah, get on the ground, not just above.

01:45:13.034 --> 01:45:17.825
MATT: All right. Now, Invisibility: how long does
it last at full duration?

01:45:17.825 --> 01:45:22.365
SAM: Looking. Up to an hour. Ooh, and it takes two
hours just to get there?

01:45:22.365 --> 01:45:26.308
MATT: Well, flying takes an hour. So, it's one of
those things you could do once you approach it.

01:45:26.308 --> 01:45:28.737
It'll last you awhile, as opposed to doing it
now.

01:45:28.737 --> 01:45:32.758
SAM: How long can you be Polymorphed for? Forever?
Concentration?

01:45:32.758 --> 01:45:35.253
MARISHA: For half of my druid level, we
discovered.

01:45:35.253 --> 01:45:38.165
MATT: So somewhere around six hours, five hours.

01:45:38.165 --> 01:45:42.609
SAM: Okay, so you fly us in, and I'll Invisibility
us right as we get to the gates.

01:45:42.609 --> 01:45:44.706
TRAVIS: And as they're going out, we get in the
trees.

01:45:44.706 --> 01:45:46.318
TALIESIN: Make sure you bring an earpiece.

01:45:46.318 --> 01:45:47.544
MARISHA: He's got an earpiece.

01:45:47.544 --> 01:45:49.504
TRAVIS: Do we, the four of us, all go up in the
trees?

01:45:49.504 --> 01:45:50.672
LIAM: Everyone get your own tree.

01:45:50.672 --> 01:45:53.519
LAURA: Everyone get your own tree?

01:45:53.519 --> 01:45:58.066
MATT: Everyone who's in a tree, please roll a
stealth check.

01:45:58.066 --> 01:45:59.363
SAM: Except for Trinket, who can't climb up.

01:45:59.363 --> 01:46:01.110
LAURA: Trinket can climb trees! Bears climb
trees!

01:46:01.110 --> 01:46:03.500
MATT: Roll an athletics check.

01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:08.184
LAURA: I'm casting Pass Without a Trace. How long
does it last?

01:46:08.184 --> 01:46:09.905
SAM: You have to roll for Trinket.

01:46:09.905 --> 01:46:12.778
LAURA: Okay, fine! I guess I'll cast it tonight,
never mind.

01:46:12.778 --> 01:46:16.870
TRAVIS: Plus ten to stealth?

01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:18.238
LAURA: Why are you being a dick, Scanlan?

01:46:18.238 --> 01:46:19.183
MATT: Well, she did not cast it.

01:46:19.183 --> 01:46:20.425
LAURA: I'm not casting it yet.

01:46:20.425 --> 01:46:21.472
TRAVIS: 14.

01:46:21.472 --> 01:46:22.735
LAURA: What are we rolling?

01:46:22.735 --> 01:46:23.840
TRAVIS: Stealth.

01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:31.227
LIAM: I already did. Those are good rolls!

01:46:31.227 --> 01:46:42.063
LAURA: 21 for me, and what do I-- just nothing. 19
for Trinket.

01:46:42.063 --> 01:46:47.308
MATT: Okay. We'll say you guys all manage to
slowly get yourself up into the tree the best you

01:46:47.308 --> 01:46:53.777
can, as you guys take off. While you guys are
away, making your way towards Whitestone, the rest

01:46:53.849 --> 01:46:59.305
of you look down, and just from a passive
perception standpoint, you pick up the most

01:46:59.305 --> 01:47:05.124
detail: you can see there is indeed a pack of
about five wolves and/or dogs a little ways away,

01:47:05.124 --> 01:47:12.776
but they're being followed by one humanoid.
They're being guided, there is a pack out here for

01:47:12.776 --> 01:47:17.721
some reason, whether it be a hunting party or
whatever other reasons there may be.

01:47:17.721 --> 01:47:20.548
It isn't a wild pack.

01:47:20.548 --> 01:47:21.919
LAURA: And they're close to us now?

01:47:21.919 --> 01:47:24.048
TRAVIS: I've been doing the dust of
tracelessness.

01:47:24.048 --> 01:47:26.654
LAURA: So, I'll cast it on us now that they're
closer.

01:47:26.654 --> 01:47:28.666
MARISHA: I wonder if that's the ground search
party.

01:47:28.666 --> 01:47:30.130
LAURA: Maybe.

01:47:30.130 --> 01:47:31.411
TRAVIS: We'll see.

01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:36.101
LAURA: So, should we add ten to all of our stealth
rolls that had been, or do we have to roll again?

01:47:36.101 --> 01:47:37.305
MATT: You'd have to roll again.

01:47:37.305 --> 01:47:38.054
LAURA: Shit balls.

01:47:38.054 --> 01:47:39.354
LIAM: So we're stealthing again in the tree?

01:47:39.354 --> 01:47:41.639
MATT: Because she's casting Pass, or you won't get
the benefit.

01:47:41.639 --> 01:47:45.073
LIAM: I'm already at a 32, man!

01:47:45.073 --> 01:47:46.257
TRAVIS: I'll take it.

01:47:46.257 --> 01:47:47.423
LAURA: You don't have to.

01:47:47.423 --> 01:47:49.302
LIAM: Let's do it, let's roll again.

01:47:49.302 --> 01:47:50.312
TALIESIN: Let's roll again.

01:47:50.312 --> 01:47:51.123
LIAM: What do we add?

01:47:51.123 --> 01:47:52.634
LAURA: Ten to whatever we roll.

01:47:52.634 --> 01:47:54.244
MATT: Go ahead and just add ten to the previous
roll.

01:47:54.244 --> 01:47:55.452
(all cheer)

01:47:55.452 --> 01:47:56.181
LIAM: Good.

01:47:56.181 --> 01:48:00.944
MARISHA: We want to keep our good rolls.

01:48:00.944 --> 01:48:10.676
MATT: So, about five breathless moments pass as
the dogs, wolves all get relatively close. One of

01:48:10.676 --> 01:48:18.735
them comes up and returns back to the pack. You
don't get a good view of the individual that is

01:48:18.735 --> 01:48:23.976
currently guiding the pack, and you see them
disappear between the thick trees in the distance.

01:48:23.976 --> 01:48:31.791
Make an active perception check for you, Vex, if
you don't mind.

01:48:31.791 --> 01:48:34.042
LAURA: Not advantage. Mountains?

01:48:34.042 --> 01:48:36.119
MATT: Is forest? No, you're in forest, now.

01:48:36.119 --> 01:48:42.121
LAURA: Oh wait! That's another!

01:48:42.121 --> 01:48:44.196
MATT: You're sure that's a favored terrain? Then
go ahead and roll again.

01:48:44.196 --> 01:48:48.446
LAURA: That was worse than the first one, that's
great.

01:48:48.446 --> 01:48:49.684
MATT: So your total is?

01:48:49.684 --> 01:48:50.835
LIAM: I rolled 20.

01:48:50.835 --> 01:48:53.051
LAURA: Okay, well, you didn't say you were doing
it. 18.

01:48:53.051 --> 01:48:58.935
MATT: 18, okay. It's hard to make out the details
at this distance. You check out, it does appear to

01:48:58.935 --> 01:49:00.278
be a female form.

01:49:00.278 --> 01:49:01.622
LAURA: Oh, it's a chick!

01:49:01.622 --> 01:49:06.419
MATT: Best you can tell, you can't tell specific
race or details. Then, another minute passes

01:49:06.419 --> 01:49:14.694
before the barking and the howls fade and the
hunting party seems to have been eluded.

01:49:14.694 --> 01:49:18.115
TALIESIN: There was no way to get a good look at
who it was.

01:49:18.115 --> 01:49:20.560
MATT: No. Do you want to make an active perception
check?

01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:24.443
TALIESIN: Actually, I would love to.

01:49:24.953 --> 01:49:26.746
MATT: Normally, if they'd passed by now--

01:49:26.746 --> 01:49:27.927
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

01:49:27.927 --> 01:49:28.986
TRAVIS: What?! Really?

01:49:28.986 --> 01:49:30.409
MATT: A natural 20?!

01:49:30.409 --> 01:49:33.765
MARISHA: I'm looking at it!

01:49:33.765 --> 01:49:37.594
TALIESIN: This is an 'I love you' for those awful
rolls earlier.

01:49:37.594 --> 01:49:39.764
TRAVIS: The golden snitch wins again.

01:49:39.764 --> 01:49:42.687
TALIESIN: That may be its name now.

01:49:42.687 --> 01:49:54.978
MATT: You see the female form, it's not someone
you particularly recognize. But the woman does

01:49:55.050 --> 01:50:05.523
appear to be older, probably in her late 40s,
early 50s. She has some hunting gear over her

01:50:05.523 --> 01:50:12.638
shoulder. She has a short bow that's strapped over
her, she has a quiver of arrows. She

01:50:12.695 --> 01:50:16.431
looks like she's hunting for food.

01:50:17.474 --> 01:50:20.732
SAM: If she was a little older, Tiberius would
kill her.

01:50:20.732 --> 01:50:23.660
(all laugh)

01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:24.815
SAM: Give her ten years.

01:50:24.815 --> 01:50:25.929
MATT: Give her ten years.

01:50:25.929 --> 01:50:27.411
TALIESIN: I don't recognize her, though?

01:50:27.411 --> 01:50:38.241
MATT: No, you don't have an immediate lead of
visual recognition. In the meantime, you guys make

01:50:38.302 --> 01:50:46.818
your way. Swooping down, you can see that cluster,
that murder of crows circling out. It's making a

01:50:46.818 --> 01:50:54.156
large pass over this entire valley. You take this
cue as you get to within visual range of the city

01:50:54.156 --> 01:50:56.479
to cast Invisibility on both of you. Is that a
3rd-level spell?

01:50:56.540 --> 01:50:57.502
SAM: Yes.

01:50:57.502 --> 01:51:02.272
MATT: Okay. Both of you vanish from view, which is
a strange feeling for you because you cannot see

01:51:02.272 --> 01:51:04.274
Keyleth, you're grasping onto something you can't
see.

01:51:04.274 --> 01:51:05.475
SAM: Oh, shit.

01:51:05.475 --> 01:51:07.171
MATT: And you just look like you're gliding
through the air.

01:51:07.171 --> 01:51:08.972
SAM: Can I do one of these?

01:51:08.972 --> 01:51:10.489
MATT: Yeah, you grab on very tightly.

01:51:10.489 --> 01:51:11.278
MARISHA: (choking noises)

01:51:11.278 --> 01:51:13.281
MATT: -- without choking. The eagle does not
have--

01:51:13.281 --> 01:51:14.305
SAM: Damn it!

01:51:14.305 --> 01:51:20.946
MATT: -- human physiology. You get two fistfuls of
feathers. And you really don't want an eagle to

01:51:20.946 --> 01:51:27.517
buck you angrily at this height. I don't think you
have Featherfall so that wouldn't go well. Looking

01:51:27.517 --> 01:51:33.416
over Whitestone, you can see outside of the city
there are some areas where the trees are

01:51:33.416 --> 01:51:39.424
carved out, and there is farmland set up
specifically to grow food and to till to maintain

01:51:39.482 --> 01:51:45.355
sustenance for the people that live there. You can
see that there's a small area that's also being

01:51:45.355 --> 01:51:51.829
cut for timber. Not a perpetual thing, but the
wood here is, you've heard previously, one of

01:51:51.829 --> 01:51:57.920
the major exports here is very high-quality timber
from this type of tree that is used for very

01:51:58.052 --> 01:52:04.377
exquisite woodcraft and furniture. So that's one
of the major exports of Whitestone as well as the

01:52:04.377 --> 01:52:13.017
quartz from the mines itself. There are people in
the city, but sparse. Make a perception check.

01:52:14.566 --> 01:52:16.093
MARISHA: Can I also make a perception check?

01:52:16.093 --> 01:52:16.784
MATT: You may.

01:52:16.784 --> 01:52:17.726
MARISHA: With my eagle vision?

01:52:17.726 --> 01:52:19.640
MATT: (singsong) You may.

01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:27.023
MARISHA: 14, so that's 24. And I have Keen Sight,
which means

01:52:27.023 --> 01:52:29.251
I have advantage on all perception checks.

01:52:29.251 --> 01:52:30.622
MATT: Yes, you do.

01:52:30.622 --> 01:52:31.652
MARISHA: I'll take that 14.

01:52:31.652 --> 01:52:32.711
TALIESIN: She'll take that 14.

01:52:32.711 --> 01:52:33.887
MARISHA: As opposed to that one.

01:52:33.887 --> 01:52:34.547
MATT: Total of 14?

01:52:34.547 --> 01:52:35.363
MARISHA: 24.

01:52:35.363 --> 01:52:43.739
MATT: 24. Okay. As you get close enough to start
scanning over details, you can see that a lot of

01:52:43.739 --> 01:52:52.469
the buildings appear to be closed or empty. There
are people working in the fields. As you make your

01:52:52.469 --> 01:52:57.190
way to the center of the town, there is a town
square. There is a tree there, a very large, old

01:52:57.190 --> 01:53:03.160
tree that is twisted, with all these various
gnarled branches that reach out. You recall

01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:09.556
Desmond mentioning something called the Sun Tree
that is the centerpiece of this area. And you get

01:53:09.556 --> 01:53:15.390
a view enough of the tree to see that there are
eight humanoid bodies

01:53:15.390 --> 01:53:17.725
of varying ages swinging from it.

01:53:17.725 --> 01:53:18.500
SAM: Ooh.

01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:20.386
LAURA: Oh no.

01:53:20.386 --> 01:53:33.856
MATT: You also notice that, patrolling through the
city at very slow paces, there are a few larger

01:53:33.856 --> 01:53:35.689
than normal humanoids.

01:53:35.689 --> 01:53:36.935
LAURA: (gasps)

01:53:36.935 --> 01:53:43.631
MATT: You see what appear to be approximately six
giants patrolling through the town, but you can

01:53:43.631 --> 01:53:48.033
see some of them are like wrecked and broken. One
of them is missing an arm and

01:53:48.033 --> 01:53:50.398
is dragging a foot behind it.

01:53:50.398 --> 01:53:52.720
LAURA: They're zombie giants?!

01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:55.832
MATT: Apparently, whenever one of them is moving
through, most of the denizens of the town keep a

01:53:55.832 --> 01:53:59.822
very wide berth, and generally avoid them entirely
and go about their business, at a distance.

01:53:59.822 --> 01:54:01.390
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:54:01.390 --> 01:54:04.904
LIAM: I miss Pike.

01:54:04.904 --> 01:54:06.568
TRAVIS: Six?

01:54:06.568 --> 01:54:07.736
SAM: No problem.

01:54:07.736 --> 01:54:14.314
MATT: Like over all of the entire city. They're
pretty well scattered about. After you do a full

01:54:14.314 --> 01:54:18.411
pass over the city, those are most of the details
you can make out at this height. Anything further,

01:54:18.411 --> 01:54:22.710
any specifics, you want to go for before heading
back?

01:54:22.975 --> 01:54:25.762
SAM: You want to set me down so I can go talk to
people?

01:54:25.762 --> 01:54:26.920
MARISHA: You want to talk to people?

01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:31.624
SAM: Well, or at least eavesdrop. We don't know if
they're all vampires or not.

01:54:31.624 --> 01:54:37.544
MARISHA: Does it look like there's a central part
where there's a lot of people gathered?

01:54:37.544 --> 01:54:43.177
MATT: Farmlands look likely to be the largest
cluster of people. You can see, since it's getting

01:54:43.177 --> 01:54:48.940
to the end of the day, there are folks finishing up gathering
the crops that were available to them or sort

01:54:49.117 --> 01:54:52.868
of planting as they go through. And you can see
there's about five or six people that are all in

01:54:52.868 --> 01:54:56.433
one group. Most everyone else seems to be
relatively solitary and trying to go about their

01:54:56.433 --> 01:54:57.910
business as fast as possible.

01:54:57.910 --> 01:54:59.397
MARISHA: The town square's emptying out?

01:54:59.397 --> 01:55:03.256
MATT: The town square? Nobody is in the town
square. People are avoiding it like the plague.

01:55:03.256 --> 01:55:06.761
There's eight bodies hanging from the tree, and
nobody wants to be there.

01:55:06.761 --> 01:55:12.965
MARISHA: All right. I'm going to swoop down and
find a tree, where the five or six farmers are,

01:55:12.965 --> 01:55:15.465
and perch, see if Scanlan can get a good--

01:55:15.465 --> 01:55:17.891
MATT: There actually are no trees by the farm, all
the trees have been cleared out to make the

01:55:17.891 --> 01:55:21.989
farmland. So there's actually a bit of the forest
that's been cleared for that purpose.

01:55:22.062 --> 01:55:23.749
MARISHA: It's just open and empty.

01:55:23.749 --> 01:55:27.905
MATT: Yeah. You can go to a tree that's nearby,
but that's like 300 feet away.

01:55:27.905 --> 01:55:29.693
MARISHA: A rooftop? A wall? Anything I can perch
on?

01:55:29.693 --> 01:55:32.275
MATT: There is a wall. There is a wall on the
outskirts of Whitestone.

01:55:32.275 --> 01:55:33.631
MARISHA: I perch on the wall.

01:55:33.631 --> 01:55:36.438
MATT: Okay. You swoop down and you perch on the
edge of the wall there. It's about 25 feet up.

01:55:36.438 --> 01:55:45.512
SAM: I'm just going to walk down there. I won't be
able to see you, so I'm going to leave a little--

01:55:45.512 --> 01:55:47.558
MARISHA: I'll keep an-- Oh, wait, I can't see
you.

01:55:47.558 --> 01:55:51.138
MATT: And you can't talk right now, you're an
eagle.

01:55:51.138 --> 01:55:59.004
SAM: I leave a little, like a canteen or
something, right where she's perched, just so I

01:55:59.004 --> 01:56:00.308
know where to find her.

01:56:00.308 --> 01:56:01.148
MATT: Okay.

01:56:01.148 --> 01:56:02.303
TRAVIS: Smart.

01:56:02.303 --> 01:56:03.668
TALIESIN: Leave the mug.

01:56:03.668 --> 01:56:10.712
SAM: Yeah, my stein. And then I'm going to walk
down and see if I can stealthily

01:56:10.712 --> 01:56:13.517
eavesdrop on some conversations.

01:56:13.517 --> 01:56:19.071
MATT: Okay. You make your way down the 25-foot
wall she's perched on.

01:56:19.071 --> 01:56:21.260
SAM: Oh, shit. Am I going to fall?

01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:22.824
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check to
climb.

01:56:22.824 --> 01:56:24.999
TALIESIN: You say that out loud?

01:56:25.605 --> 01:56:26.715
SAM: Athletics?

01:56:26.715 --> 01:56:27.211
MATT: Yes.

01:56:27.211 --> 01:56:28.079
SAM: 17.

01:56:28.079 --> 01:56:35.183
MATT: 17. The stonework here is old and you manage
to not lose your footing entirely as you bring

01:56:35.183 --> 01:56:38.813
your way down. Thankfully, you're light enough,
and the stones are not too large, so you can get

01:56:38.813 --> 01:56:43.940
some good handholds. You do, over the next 12
minutes or so,

01:56:43.940 --> 01:56:46.378
make your way to the base of the wall.

01:56:46.378 --> 01:56:48.321
SAM: It took me 12 minutes to climb 25 feet?

01:56:48.321 --> 01:56:49.060
MATT: Yep.

01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:51.001
SAM: Nice. I suck.

01:56:51.001 --> 01:56:53.332
MARISHA: Maybe whistle for me when you come back.

01:56:53.332 --> 01:57:02.363
MATT: A lot of moments of (gasps) 'whoa, okay'.
But, you catch yourself. I mean, you can just jump

01:57:02.363 --> 01:57:07.274
if you wanted to make it less. But, the duration
of your invisibility-- you have about 20 more

01:57:07.274 --> 01:57:08.747
minutes before it dissipates.

01:57:08.747 --> 01:57:09.887
SAM: Oh shit, I have to do this quick.

01:57:09.887 --> 01:57:13.267
MATT: You look over the edge, and you can see that
they have carts up and that they have what

01:57:13.267 --> 01:57:18.314
vegetables they have, and a lot of vegetables,
even at a close look, a lot of them look withered.

01:57:18.314 --> 01:57:21.935
It looks like there is a general sense of
frustration that the land itself is not producing

01:57:21.935 --> 01:57:28.628
quality crops. And even the people look unhealthy
and gaunt by nature. Whether it be the cold winter

01:57:28.628 --> 01:57:33.921
recently or just their general spirit is broken,
but there is a feeling about these people that

01:57:33.921 --> 01:57:40.723
life here is not what it used to be. There isn't a
whole lot of conversation, there's mutterings here

01:57:40.723 --> 01:57:47.567
and there. "We have to make sure we get these back
in time. Fill the cart, we have two carts we have

01:57:47.639 --> 01:57:50.312
"to get in." And the other one's, "I know, I know,
I'm trying," And they're putting it over there and

01:57:50.312 --> 01:57:52.972
there's a little bit of frustration among them.

01:57:52.972 --> 01:57:54.335
SAM: He's doing walla.

01:57:54.335 --> 01:57:59.366
(all laugh)

01:57:59.366 --> 01:58:07.278
MATT: One of them ends up counting the last bit of
crop. "That's it, that's all we have. That is the

01:58:07.338 --> 01:58:11.104
"entire pull for the day." And the older gentleman,
who is overseeing it, grinds his hands and goes,

01:58:11.104 --> 01:58:14.869
"Sir Kerrion is going to have my hide."

01:58:14.869 --> 01:58:19.245
SAM: Wait, wasn't that one of the people--

01:58:19.245 --> 01:58:27.827
MATT: "At the very least, let's gather it together
and hopefully Pelor will protect us." And the

01:58:27.827 --> 01:58:34.411
people take the carts and begin making their way
towards the outer gate on the southeast side of

01:58:34.411 --> 01:58:36.934
Whitestone, where you guys are currently at.

01:58:36.934 --> 01:58:41.832
SAM: Okay. I'm going to hustle back to the roof.

01:58:41.832 --> 01:58:43.717
MATT: All right. Make an athletics check.

01:58:43.717 --> 01:58:45.237
SAM: Jesus.

01:58:45.237 --> 01:58:47.008
MARISHA: I can come get you.

01:58:47.008 --> 01:58:49.904
TALIESIN: You'll hear a thump.

01:58:49.904 --> 01:58:50.988
SAM: Eight.

01:58:50.988 --> 01:58:53.347
(all laugh)

01:58:53.347 --> 01:58:55.535
LIAM: Hopefully he lands on his lute.

01:58:55.535 --> 01:58:57.116
SAM: No, it's nine.

01:58:57.116 --> 01:59:05.825
MATT: Okay. 15 minutes. After five minutes of
eavesdropping you realize that you are not going

01:59:05.825 --> 01:59:11.931
to make it up that wall, and you feel the magic of
your Invisibility illusion about to fade. At this

01:59:11.931 --> 01:59:15.759
point, by the way, the sun has just hit the edge
of the mountains, the sky itself is a vibrant,

01:59:15.759 --> 01:59:20.284
reddish orange slowly turning to purple and sunset
is upon you.

01:59:25.363 --> 01:59:26.958
SAM: I want to spend the night here. No.

01:59:27.212 --> 01:59:28.983
MARISHA: Can I see him?

01:59:28.983 --> 01:59:30.790
MATT: He's invisible, no.

01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:35.279
SAM: I will sneak around the corner a little bit,
wait for an opening, and I lose Invisibility,

01:59:35.279 --> 01:59:40.267
which will drop it on her as well, and I will
Dimension Door back up to the roof.

01:59:40.267 --> 01:59:47.951
MATT: Okay. As you pass to the side, the illusion
fades, you step into a small opening of dark,

01:59:47.951 --> 01:59:51.309
purplish energy and then reemerge on the top of
the wall--

01:59:51.309 --> 01:59:53.027
MATT and SAM: Grab the canteen.

01:59:53.027 --> 01:59:54.299
MATT: --and hop back on the back of her.

01:59:54.299 --> 01:59:56.346
SAM: Oh, shit. Invisibility again.

01:59:56.346 --> 02:00:03.882
MATT: Okay. Okay. You guys vanish, and Keyleth,
you take off back in the direction you guys

02:00:03.882 --> 02:00:08.424
traveled from. In the meantime, guys, what do you
want to have been doing? Are you just waiting, are

02:00:08.424 --> 02:00:10.061
you traveling further in, are you staying where
you are?

02:00:10.061 --> 02:00:11.386
TRAVIS: (snores)

02:00:11.386 --> 02:00:12.590
TALIESIN: We have to wait.

02:00:12.590 --> 02:00:16.873
LAURA: Yeah, keeping an ear out for the wolves and
just chilling in a tree.

02:00:16.873 --> 02:00:18.292
TRAVIS: (yells) I fall out of the tree.

02:00:18.292 --> 02:00:21.241
LAURA: And also, I'm restringing my new, awesome
bow.

02:00:21.241 --> 02:00:22.825
MATT: With the--?

02:00:22.825 --> 02:00:24.171
LAURA: With the blazing bowstring.

02:00:24.171 --> 02:00:25.872
MATT: Okay.

02:00:25.872 --> 02:00:30.004
LAURA: Which, by the way, is a longbow of sky
sentinel.

02:00:30.004 --> 02:00:32.488
SAM: Sky sentinel, what does that mean?

02:00:32.488 --> 02:00:42.121
LAURA: Once per long rest, I can use a Storm
Arrow, which means that the next arrow I fire

02:00:42.121 --> 02:00:50.594
splits into three arrows. Roll an attack for each
of them, they all get 1d6 extra for each one that

02:00:50.594 --> 02:00:53.821
hits. It's amazing!

02:00:53.821 --> 02:00:55.603
SAM: Every time you use it, or is at a one-time--

02:00:55.603 --> 02:00:57.537
LAURA: It's one time per long rest.

02:00:57.537 --> 02:00:58.834
MARISHA: That's awesome!

02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:02.119
MATT: Once per day, she fires an arrow and the
arrow splits into three, and each one bursts into

02:01:02.119 --> 02:01:04.564
thunder damage, bursts of them.

02:01:04.564 --> 02:01:07.612
LAURA: Say what?! So, is it lightning damage or is
it--

02:01:07.612 --> 02:01:09.201
MATT: Thunder damage. It should say on there.

02:01:09.201 --> 02:01:10.093
LAURA: It says lightning damage.

02:01:10.093 --> 02:01:10.970
MATT: Oh, then it would be lightning damage.

02:01:10.970 --> 02:01:12.359
MARISHA: It's a taser arrow.

02:01:12.359 --> 02:01:13.408
TALIESIN: It's basically a taser.

02:01:13.408 --> 02:01:16.164
MATT: So yeah, it's pretty fun.

02:01:16.164 --> 02:01:17.463
SAM: Thunder!

02:01:17.463 --> 02:01:19.423
LAURA: Thunder!

02:01:19.423 --> 02:01:20.918
MATT: What's that from?

02:01:20.918 --> 02:01:23.105
SAM: I don't know.

02:01:23.105 --> 02:01:29.269
MATT: So, the night falls and the crickets begin
to emerge, the slow mist begins to form.

02:01:29.269 --> 02:01:31.886
LAURA: Wait, our friends aren't back yet. It's
already night and they're not back?

02:01:31.886 --> 02:01:38.347
LIAM: I just want to say that I pulled my hood
down, and put on my calamari hat, and pulled the

02:01:38.347 --> 02:01:39.579
hood back over it.

02:01:39.579 --> 02:01:50.391
MATT: Okay. So you take the partially rusted over,
but functional, metallic skull cap that Clarota

02:01:50.391 --> 02:01:55.717
was wearing when you guys met in the Underdark,
that Clarota no longer needs.

02:01:56.507 --> 02:01:57.734
TRAVIS: Because he's dead.

02:01:57.734 --> 02:02:00.867
MATT: You place it on your head and it's a little
loose. As you place it on, it rattles for a

02:02:00.867 --> 02:02:06.598
moment, and then it form-fits to your skull. Your
hair being pinched beneath it and just emerging

02:02:06.598 --> 02:02:09.426
from underneath, almost Loki-helmet-style.

02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:11.420
LAURA: Looking snazzy, Vax.

02:02:11.420 --> 02:02:13.057
TRAVIS: Nice bonnet.

02:02:13.057 --> 02:02:16.059
SAM: (imitating Clarota) I'm on your head.

02:02:16.059 --> 02:02:20.655
MATT: There's a weird buzzing vibrational feel as
its magic attunes to you over the next hour or so

02:02:20.655 --> 02:02:23.687
as you're waiting, but you get the sensation that
it will offer some decent

02:02:23.687 --> 02:02:29.796
protection from impeding charm effects.

02:02:29.796 --> 02:02:30.666
LIAM: It tingles.

02:02:30.666 --> 02:02:33.057
LAURA: It looks like you have a mullet.

02:02:33.057 --> 02:02:34.640
LIAM: Yeah, dude.

02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:41.186
MATT: A Loki mullet. You start to get really
nervous about the arrival of your friends, until

02:02:41.186 --> 02:02:48.125
eventually you hear the flapping of wings. You
look up and you can see, since it has taken an

02:02:48.125 --> 02:02:54.924
hour to get there, the illusion just fades, both a
giant eagle and Scanlan appear in the moonlight,

02:02:54.924 --> 02:02:59.239
right above the canopy of the forest you guys are
close to, and return to the place you were.

02:02:59.239 --> 02:03:10.292
LAURA: Keyleth, question. Can you make it look
like we're not here with your foliage shit?

02:03:10.292 --> 02:03:15.213
MARISHA: I drop my Beast Shape, holding onto a
branch.

02:03:15.213 --> 02:03:16.696
LAURA: You know, the illusions.

02:03:16.696 --> 02:03:17.669
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:03:17.669 --> 02:03:18.793
TALIESIN: Good, good.

02:03:18.793 --> 02:03:21.008
LAURA: Can we camp up in the tree? So nobody can
come towards us.

02:03:21.008 --> 02:03:21.803
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:03:21.803 --> 02:03:23.361
SAM: What if we fall out?

02:03:23.361 --> 02:03:27.286
MARISHA: I Druidcraft some spiderweb hammocks.

02:03:27.286 --> 02:03:29.046
LAURA: Ooh.

02:03:29.046 --> 02:03:33.332
TALIESIN: Sticky.

02:03:34.186 --> 02:03:36.990
MARISHA: And, as usual, light some sage.

02:03:37.730 --> 02:03:40.805
MATT: Takes about an hour or so, but you manage to
pull from the surroundings these really nice,

02:03:40.805 --> 02:03:45.989
thick spider silk hammocks, that should be able to
support your respective weights. Grog is the only

02:03:45.989 --> 02:03:51.009
one that might be questionable with the sheer
amount of weight that is his form.

02:03:51.009 --> 02:03:52.110
TRAVIS: I like it.

02:03:52.110 --> 02:03:54.404
MARISHA: Maybe take a rope and tie it.

02:03:54.404 --> 02:03:57.369
TRAVIS: Nope, this is a trust exercise.

02:03:57.369 --> 02:04:02.183
LAURA: I'm using Hide in Plain Sight to make me
and Trinket extra, extra hidey.

02:04:02.183 --> 02:04:06.008
LIAM: I have a question. The only reason I have
this question is because I posted that video from

02:04:06.008 --> 02:04:10.360
a couple of years ago. Do I still have the
unending rope?

02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:12.277
LAURA: I have the unending rope, motherfucker.

02:04:12.277 --> 02:04:16.610
LIAM: Why don't we reinforce with the rope?

02:04:16.610 --> 02:04:17.682
LAURA: Sure, why not.

02:04:17.682 --> 02:04:19.060
TRAVIS: You don't like the trust exercise?

02:04:19.060 --> 02:04:20.725
LAURA: That's where all the rope comes from that
we ever use.

02:04:20.725 --> 02:04:23.259
LIAM: I'm sorry I brought it up. I'd love you to
fall on your head.

02:04:23.259 --> 02:04:25.375
LAURA: Let's reinforce the spiderwebs.

02:04:25.375 --> 02:04:27.652
TRAVIS: No, I'm good, thank you.

02:04:27.652 --> 02:04:37.723
MARISHA: Whoa, Vax. Nice helmet. Don Quixote
called.

02:04:37.723 --> 02:04:39.593
LIAM: Aerodynamic, isn't it?

02:04:39.593 --> 02:04:41.248
MARISHA: He wants his bowl back.

02:04:41.248 --> 02:04:44.700
SAM: Before we slumber, we did a little intel, a
little recon.

02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:45.864
LAURA: Oh, yeah. What's up?

02:04:45.864 --> 02:04:53.165
SAM: Turns out the town is full of humans, except
for these six vampire giants-- zombie giants.

02:04:53.165 --> 02:04:56.989
MARISHA: They all appear to be fairly miserable
people.

02:04:56.989 --> 02:05:02.719
SAM: However, this could be useful. Everyone in
the town, the farmers anyway, seem to be gathering

02:05:02.719 --> 02:05:12.427
produce to deliver to the Briarwoods. We could
pose as some sort of farmer troupe with a basket

02:05:12.427 --> 02:05:15.112
of goodies, and maybe get through the front gate.

02:05:15.112 --> 02:05:18.463
LAURA: Don't you think they would know all the
farmers around at this point? They've been there

02:05:18.463 --> 02:05:19.726
for a long time.

02:05:19.726 --> 02:05:23.833
MARISHA: They did reference Sir Kerrion by name.
Oh, they referenced Sir Kerrion, Percy.

02:05:23.833 --> 02:05:25.012
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:05:25.012 --> 02:05:32.628
SAM: We could make ourselves look like some of
them. One of us has a hat of disguise.

02:05:32.628 --> 02:05:36.612
MARISHA: Also, there was something other really
important.

02:05:36.612 --> 02:05:37.997
SAM: What?

02:05:37.997 --> 02:05:39.686
MARISHA: The town was pretty much empty.

02:05:39.686 --> 02:05:40.801
SAM: Oh, yes, this.

02:05:40.801 --> 02:05:46.055
MARISHA: And that Sun Tree, that what's-his-name--
Who said that? Jarett?

02:05:46.055 --> 02:05:46.975
MATT: Desmond.

02:05:46.975 --> 02:05:56.162
MARISHA: Desmond. Looks like there were some
executions that took place. There were about eight

02:05:56.162 --> 02:05:59.002
bodies hanging from that tree.

02:05:59.002 --> 02:06:01.238
LAURA: Why is it called the Sun Tree?

02:06:01.238 --> 02:06:07.242
SAM: It's really lovely. I don't know, maybe it
gets sun.

02:06:07.242 --> 02:06:09.529
MARISHA: I don't know. Why do they call it the Sun
Tree?

02:06:09.529 --> 02:06:14.265
TALIESIN: Can I go with this? Unless you have a
particular reason to--

02:06:14.507 --> 02:06:17.928
MATT: I mean, you can go with-- There are maybe
many reasons it's called the Sun Tree.

02:06:17.928 --> 02:06:21.534
LAURA: There's reasons. Maybe we need to battle
them at the Sun Tree.

02:06:21.534 --> 02:06:27.252
TALIESIN: Legends say that before the castle was
built, that the journey into the valley was

02:06:27.252 --> 02:06:34.663
treacherous and stormy, and the original builders
of Whitecastle feared they would die. And this

02:06:34.663 --> 02:06:40.599
one, great tree stood in the valley, and it was
underneath it that they took shelter. And as they

02:06:40.599 --> 02:06:44.353
began to take shelter, the storm broke. And the
storm did not return

02:06:44.353 --> 02:06:46.827
until the castle was completed.

02:06:46.827 --> 02:06:48.969
SAM: That's a lovely story.

02:06:48.969 --> 02:06:54.081
TALIESIN: We hold our festivals there every year.

02:06:54.081 --> 02:06:56.321
SAM: And now it's being used as a--

02:06:56.321 --> 02:06:57.616
TALIESIN: As a gallow, yes.

02:06:57.616 --> 02:06:59.662
LAURA: Does it get a lot of sun?

02:06:59.662 --> 02:07:08.417
MATT: You do know, and this ties into your story
as well, because the guidance in forging the city

02:07:08.417 --> 02:07:15.114
of Whitestone, that tree was representative to
them as a guardian of Pelor, the god of the sun.

02:07:15.114 --> 02:07:18.727
The protector of light, holiness--

02:07:18.727 --> 02:07:19.913
SAM: Who that?

02:07:19.913 --> 02:07:21.596
TALIESIN: A very serious god.

02:07:21.596 --> 02:07:23.441
TRAVIS: That could help.

02:07:23.441 --> 02:07:26.500
LAURA: That could help us, because vampires hate
the sun.

02:07:26.500 --> 02:07:30.293
SAM: Why would they make camp in the place where
the god of the sun--

02:07:30.293 --> 02:07:33.302
LAURA: Maybe that's why they're hanging bodies
from it, to taint it.

02:07:33.302 --> 02:07:36.379
LIAM: Maybe that's why it's protected. Maybe--

02:07:36.379 --> 02:07:40.974
SAM: Are any of us religious with that god, or--?

02:07:40.974 --> 02:07:43.986
MARISHA: Can we call Pike through your magic poo?

02:07:43.986 --> 02:07:45.668
LAURA: Would she be able to hear us?

02:07:45.668 --> 02:07:46.893
TALIESIN: Tablet of Apple?

02:07:46.893 --> 02:07:48.414
SAM: I can at least see what she is up to.

02:07:48.414 --> 02:07:51.342
LIAM: Keyleth, would you be able to revive the
tree?

02:07:51.342 --> 02:07:56.024
LAURA: (gasps) Bring it back.

02:07:56.024 --> 02:07:59.708
SAM: What would that do?

02:07:59.708 --> 02:08:01.779
MARISHA: Yeah, I can, actually.

02:08:01.779 --> 02:08:04.779
LAURA: I don't know. Bring up the god of the sun
again, I don't know.

02:08:04.779 --> 02:08:08.910
SAM: We're not religious people. We can't summon
the gods willy-nilly.

02:08:08.910 --> 02:08:10.187
LIAM: We can please Pelor.

02:08:10.187 --> 02:08:12.257
LAURA: Don't tell us what we can and can't do,
Scanlan.

02:08:12.257 --> 02:08:16.858
SAM: I'm sorry. We can do all of those things.
Yes, let's go in the middle of the

02:08:16.858 --> 02:08:24.349
vampire-infested town and do some arbory to try to
heal the tree, and then we'll just say, oh, sun

02:08:24.349 --> 02:08:26.111
god, please rain down sun here.

02:08:26.111 --> 02:08:27.027
LAURA: I like it. Let's do it.

02:08:27.027 --> 02:08:29.173
SAM: That's a great plan.

02:08:29.173 --> 02:08:32.809
TRAVIS: Can we at least try cutting down the
bodies and running, and seeing what happens?

02:08:32.809 --> 02:08:36.908
SAM: We could.

02:08:36.908 --> 02:08:43.660
TALIESIN: I say, in the morning we take a look at
the passage, see how well-guarded it is. And if it

02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:50.970
looks dangerous, sneak our way into the town. If
people are not enthralled, if they are being

02:08:50.970 --> 02:08:54.209
forced to work, then maybe we can find some
allies.

02:08:54.209 --> 02:08:56.946
MARISHA: Find allies in the town?

02:08:56.946 --> 02:08:58.459
TALIESIN: I don't think they're happy.

02:08:58.459 --> 02:09:02.138
LAURA: I think they're terrified. And I don't want
to let them know we're here, for fear they'll turn

02:09:02.138 --> 02:09:05.004
us in, in hopes of saving their own necks.

02:09:05.004 --> 02:09:09.001
MARISHA: That's what I'm thinking. Yes, they're
terrified, but this whole

02:09:09.001 --> 02:09:11.110
town's being ruled by fear.

02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:21.449
LIAM: I have a feeling we can revive that tree
somehow. It may weaken the Briarwoods' hold on the

02:09:21.449 --> 02:09:23.832
psyche of the villagers here.

02:09:23.832 --> 02:09:29.412
LAURA: This is true! It could help out. Let them
know the god of the sun is on their side.

02:09:29.412 --> 02:09:33.279
TRAVIS: I heard you're supposed to pee on a lemon
tree, so.

02:09:33.279 --> 02:09:38.038
LAURA: Probably you and Scanlan are on that, I
have a feeling.

02:09:38.038 --> 02:09:41.918
TRAVIS: Can I make a nature check to see if that's
true?

02:09:41.918 --> 02:09:46.827
TALIESIN: I really wanted to ask. What does peeing
on a lemon tree have to do with anything?

02:09:46.827 --> 02:09:48.920
MATT: Sure.

02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:52.703
TRAVIS: 19! That's 17.

02:09:52.703 --> 02:09:56.647
MATT: In your experience with the roving band of
barbarians, you guys enjoyed very much peeing on

02:09:56.647 --> 02:10:03.227
very colorful trees, of all sorts of plant life.
All of them, generally, didn't seem to, over time,

02:10:03.227 --> 02:10:08.446
react well to the process, whether it be the fact
that you all drank a lot of the time, so the

02:10:08.446 --> 02:10:10.606
content of your urine was probably not very
hospitable.

02:10:10.606 --> 02:10:12.516
LIAM: It's known as a lemon party.

02:10:12.516 --> 02:10:16.426
(all laugh)

02:10:16.426 --> 02:10:19.448
MATT: That's a whole different kind of festival.

02:10:19.448 --> 02:10:20.560
MARISHA: You killed Percy.

02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:22.532
LAURA: You killed Percy.

02:10:22.532 --> 02:10:26.218
TALIESIN: Thank you for bringing the text chat all
the way back around.

02:10:26.218 --> 02:10:28.858
TRAVIS: Operation tree rescue.

02:10:28.858 --> 02:10:33.029
MATT: The lemon party is held on the far, far
southern continent of Tubgirl,

02:10:33.029 --> 02:10:39.458
the region of Goatse.

02:10:39.458 --> 02:10:46.388
TRAVIS: I have an idea. Should we wait until the
sun comes up, create a distraction, so all the

02:10:46.388 --> 02:10:52.001
undead giants come looking, and then we have
someone go cut the bodies off the tree, and--

02:10:52.001 --> 02:10:53.767
LAURA: And bring it back to life!

02:10:53.767 --> 02:10:55.830
TRAVIS: -- let Keyleth give it a little love.

02:10:55.830 --> 02:10:57.779
MARISHA: And then what happens after that?

02:10:57.779 --> 02:10:59.390
TRAVIS: I don't know. It's an experiment, all
right?

02:10:59.390 --> 02:11:01.164
LAURA: Then we get the fuck out.

02:11:01.164 --> 02:11:03.765
SAM: Won't they know we're here? Won't the people
see us doing things?

02:11:03.765 --> 02:11:08.156
MARISHA: I know. I feel that's the equivalent of
putting dish soap in the fountain on prom night.

02:11:08.156 --> 02:11:10.774
LAURA: No! Didn't you say that all around the Sun
Tree nobody's there?

02:11:10.774 --> 02:11:13.021
MARISHA: Yeah, we did that. What?

02:11:13.021 --> 02:11:15.093
LAURA: Didn't you say nobody's around the Sun
Tree?

02:11:15.093 --> 02:11:18.147
SAM: That's true. But we still have to get in.

02:11:18.147 --> 02:11:20.102
LAURA: We'll fly up and over. You just did the
same thing.

02:11:20.102 --> 02:11:21.085
SAM: I know, I know.

02:11:21.085 --> 02:11:24.005
LAURA: Fly up and over, land, bring the tree back
to life, get out.

02:11:24.005 --> 02:11:27.777
SAM: Are you sure you don't want me to be a
carriage driver, and you'll hide in the hay of my

02:11:27.777 --> 02:11:30.688
carriage and I'll go straight up to the
Briarwoods.

02:11:30.688 --> 02:11:32.521
LAURA: I feel like they know all the townspeople.

02:11:32.521 --> 02:11:35.324
SAM: I will put on my hat of disguise, I will be
someone completely different.

02:11:35.324 --> 02:11:36.330
TRAVIS: They can see through that.

02:11:36.330 --> 02:11:38.677
LIAM: I'm telling you, they looked right through
me.

02:11:38.677 --> 02:11:39.775
LAURA: When he was invisible!

02:11:39.775 --> 02:11:42.604
LIAM: Invisible. They saw me.

02:11:42.604 --> 02:11:43.578
LAURA: They probably saw you!

02:11:43.578 --> 02:11:45.883
SAM: So while he was transparent, they saw through
him?

02:11:45.883 --> 02:11:48.584
LIAM: No, but I was heavily stealthed.

02:11:48.584 --> 02:11:49.580
LAURA: No, you were invisible.

02:11:49.580 --> 02:11:50.715
MARISHA: Oh, wow!

02:11:50.715 --> 02:11:53.806
MATT: No, the invisibility faded when he attacked
the guard.

02:11:53.806 --> 02:12:00.262
LIAM: When I beaned the guard. They should not
have been able to see me.

02:12:00.262 --> 02:12:05.067
SAM: I'm not talking about getting past the
Briarwoods. I'm talking about getting past the

02:12:05.067 --> 02:12:07.689
guards that guard their castle.

02:12:07.689 --> 02:12:13.071
MARISHA: Here's another issue. It's going to take
me a minute to do the tree.

02:12:13.071 --> 02:12:15.346
LAURA: How long?

02:12:15.346 --> 02:12:16.736
MARISHA: It might take a bit.

02:12:16.736 --> 02:12:18.892
LAURA: How long's a bit?

02:12:18.892 --> 02:12:26.503
MARISHA: Well, I mean, it's one of those things
where the longer I do it the better it'll be. I

02:12:26.503 --> 02:12:28.813
can do it for up to eight hours.

02:12:28.813 --> 02:12:29.893
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

02:12:29.893 --> 02:12:35.920
MARISHA: If I do it for up to eight hours, I
enrich the land over half a mile radius, centered

02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:39.094
on a single point, and the land becomes enriched
for a solid year.

02:12:39.094 --> 02:12:40.368
LAURA: I don't want to enrich all of the--

02:12:40.368 --> 02:12:44.416
LIAM: Question. What time was it when they were
doing their little scouting thing they've just

02:12:44.416 --> 02:12:47.515
told us about? The sun was going down?

02:12:47.515 --> 02:12:51.980
MATT: Yeah, they probably would've gotten to
Whitestone around seven o'clock, and leaving right

02:12:51.980 --> 02:12:54.280
as the sun had fully set.

02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:55.593
LAURA: If we go right when the sun goes up--

02:12:55.593 --> 02:13:03.245
LIAM: Yes, we get there at sunrise, take those
fucking beasts out, and you start at eight AM.

02:13:03.245 --> 02:13:04.477
SAM: But then what?

02:13:04.477 --> 02:13:10.907
LAURA: We just sneak in. Here's the thing. I don't
know if you want to get all the crops all fancy,

02:13:10.907 --> 02:13:15.064
because it'll just feed the Briarwoods. Maybe just
do the tree area,

02:13:15.064 --> 02:13:17.085
which will be like two hours, maybe.

02:13:17.085 --> 02:13:20.854
MARISHA: Yeah? I think if I have a solid hour or
two hours with it.

02:13:20.854 --> 02:13:28.130
SAM: Once the tree is healed, we have no one of
religious power to summon any god. We don't know

02:13:28.130 --> 02:13:30.691
anything about this god, none of us do!

02:13:30.691 --> 02:13:33.783
TALIESIN: I do, in theory, if I'm from--

02:13:33.783 --> 02:13:35.785
MATT: Go ahead and roll a religion check.

02:13:35.785 --> 02:13:36.603
TALIESIN: A which?

02:13:36.603 --> 02:13:37.667
MATT: A religion check.

02:13:37.667 --> 02:13:38.729
LAURA: A witch?

02:13:38.729 --> 02:13:40.236
MATT: A witch.

02:13:40.236 --> 02:13:41.303
TALIESIN: 16.

02:13:41.303 --> 02:13:49.040
MATT: 16? Okay. Pelor is the god of the sun and
agriculture. It's a good deity and is generally

02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:56.544
worshipped by farmers and simple folk and people
that live off the land, and generally it's the

02:13:56.544 --> 02:14:01.424
most nature-based deity of the main spectrum,
outside of Melora, which is the deity of nature.

02:14:01.424 --> 02:14:06.107
MARISHA: Oh. Well, dope! Would I know stuff like
that too, then?

02:14:06.107 --> 02:14:11.994
MATT: You know of Pelor, yeah. There are elements
of Pelor's following that bleeds into your druidic

02:14:11.994 --> 02:14:14.458
nature, though you don't necessarily follow a
deity.

02:14:14.458 --> 02:14:16.618
MARISHA: Right. We're free.

02:14:16.618 --> 02:14:19.025
MATT: You believe that the essence of nature in
itself is your patron.

02:14:19.025 --> 02:14:20.509
MARISHA: Totally.

02:14:20.509 --> 02:14:24.589
MATT: You are not a religious man by nature, and
you know that there is a strong following of Pelor

02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:29.725
in the town. The entire graveyard that you talked
about earlier, that one is largely built around

02:14:29.725 --> 02:14:37.284
the imagery of Pelor. And of all the gods that are
worshipped here, Pelor's probably 75% of the

02:14:37.284 --> 02:14:42.067
population of Whitestone where, in some shape or
form, if not devout worshippers, at least were

02:14:42.067 --> 02:14:44.452
like, yeah, Pelor's cool.

02:14:44.452 --> 02:14:56.889
MARISHA: Here's my question. I feel Pike's energy
tonight. Maybe, while I'm meditating, I can

02:14:56.889 --> 02:15:04.365
somehow reach out to her, and maybe ask her to get
in touch with Sarenrae, and maybe Sarenrae can

02:15:04.365 --> 02:15:06.470
call up her homeboy Pelor.

02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:07.795
LAURA: Do you think that works?

02:15:07.795 --> 02:15:09.726
MARISHA: I don't know.

02:15:09.726 --> 02:15:10.972
TRAVIS: This is like phone a friend?

02:15:10.972 --> 02:15:14.034
MARISHA: We're not organized religion people, we
Ashari.

02:15:14.034 --> 02:15:21.068
LIAM: The tree is called the Sun Tree. It's
Pelor's tree. I'm not a cleric of Sarenrae, but

02:15:21.068 --> 02:15:25.003
these shitbags could not have set up camp in a
temple of Sarenrae because there is too much

02:15:25.003 --> 02:15:31.462
goodness there, as there was around this tree in
this town, and it's why it is dead. It's why it's

02:15:31.462 --> 02:15:35.814
being surrounded by a bunch of giant undead
things, as you described.

02:15:35.814 --> 02:15:38.556
You need faith, Scanlan Shorthalt.

02:15:38.556 --> 02:15:43.225
SAM: Me? I am the antithesis of faith.

02:15:43.225 --> 02:15:47.177
LIAM: Then you need to shut up and let us fix that
tree.

02:15:47.177 --> 02:15:48.541
SAM: And then what?

02:15:48.541 --> 02:15:50.417
TRAVIS: Who knows?

02:15:50.417 --> 02:15:54.213
SAM: We're going to fight off a million monsters
to heal a tree, and then we're going to say,

02:15:54.213 --> 02:15:58.340
"Okay. Bring out the sun," or something.

02:15:58.340 --> 02:16:02.798
MARISHA: Hang on! What did you just say?

02:16:02.798 --> 02:16:04.471
TALIESIN: What?

02:16:04.471 --> 02:16:08.646
MARISHA: That thing you just said that no one
heard because we were all shouting and arguing?

02:16:08.646 --> 02:16:10.827
Rally the townsfolk?

02:16:10.827 --> 02:16:16.840
TALIESIN: Rally the townsfolk. This is something I
think-- I don't think that sneaking in is

02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:24.478
necessarily the answer. I'm not saying go in, guns
blazing, but I say we let them know--

02:16:24.752 --> 02:16:26.427
MARISHA: You want to build a militia?

02:16:26.427 --> 02:16:28.210
TALIESIN: I want to build a rebellion.

02:16:28.210 --> 02:16:30.547
LAURA: I like it. They would recognize you,
wouldn't they, Percy?

02:16:30.547 --> 02:16:32.150
TALIESIN: I have a plan.

02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:33.184
TRAVIS: You have a plan?

02:16:33.184 --> 02:16:36.067
SAM: Does it involve healing the tree?

02:16:36.067 --> 02:16:36.923
TALIESIN: It does.

02:16:36.923 --> 02:16:39.849
LIAM: I don't think there is any sneaking in,
thanks to those birds,

02:16:39.849 --> 02:16:42.417
so we make a stand out here.

02:16:42.417 --> 02:16:44.439
TRAVIS: Tell us your plan.

02:16:44.439 --> 02:16:49.936
TALIESIN: My plan is, we do our best to sneak in,
we find cover. Obviously, you said there's

02:16:49.936 --> 02:16:59.722
abandoned buildings. We find cover. We heal the
tree. I have some other ideas. We take those

02:16:59.722 --> 02:17:04.555
zombie giants out one by one, quietly.

02:17:04.555 --> 02:17:06.251
SAM: We're going to be insurgents?

02:17:06.251 --> 02:17:07.860
TRAVIS: Shh! Let him finish the plan!

02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:09.446
SAM: I kind of love this.

02:17:09.446 --> 02:17:10.368
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:17:10.368 --> 02:17:11.968
MARISHA: It's like Attack on Titan. That's cool!

02:17:11.968 --> 02:17:15.658
TALIESIN: Let's start finding our friends, and we
start making friends.

02:17:15.658 --> 02:17:18.502
We let them know we're back.

02:17:18.502 --> 02:17:19.651
LAURA: I like it.

02:17:19.651 --> 02:17:24.650
MARISHA: I like having the people. It feels less
like we're the United States.

02:17:24.650 --> 02:17:25.896
TRAVIS: Okay, where do we start?

02:17:25.896 --> 02:17:29.850
TALIESIN: I have some parchment. I have the thing
I want to build, while I'm in the tree. It's very

02:17:29.850 --> 02:17:32.685
simple, and I want to show you what it is.

02:17:32.685 --> 02:17:36.064
MATT: What is it?

02:17:36.064 --> 02:17:40.951
TALIESIN: I want to take some gunpowder and
basically--

02:17:40.951 --> 02:17:42.926
SAM: Make a pipe bomb.

02:17:42.926 --> 02:17:47.030
TALIESIN: Basically attach it to a piece of
parchment. I want to wet it into a piece of

02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:54.535
parchment and let it dry so that when I set fire
to that piece of parchment, I get a burn scar. I'd

02:17:54.535 --> 02:17:55.808
like to create a burn scar.

02:17:55.808 --> 02:17:56.729
LAURA: (gasps)

02:17:56.729 --> 02:17:57.639
MATT: Yeah, that's totally doable.

02:17:57.639 --> 02:17:58.501
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:17:58.501 --> 02:18:04.681
MATT: Go ahead and roll a tinkering check, just
for the sake of a possible epic failure.

02:18:04.681 --> 02:18:06.161
MARISHA: A burn on yourself?

02:18:06.161 --> 02:18:10.730
TALIESIN: No, it'll scar anything. It just creates
a very high heat.

02:18:10.730 --> 02:18:11.637
SAM: Like a mark?

02:18:11.637 --> 02:18:12.580
MARISHA: Like a brand.

02:18:12.580 --> 02:18:13.766
SAM: Like our mark.

02:18:13.766 --> 02:18:14.776
TALIESIN: Like a mark.

02:18:14.776 --> 02:18:16.023
SAM: Like our mark.

02:18:16.023 --> 02:18:16.770
TALIESIN: Not our mark.

02:18:16.770 --> 02:18:17.773
SAM: The resistance.

02:18:17.773 --> 02:18:18.905
TALIESIN: The resistance.

02:18:18.905 --> 02:18:20.201
SAM: I need a beret.

02:18:20.201 --> 02:18:22.531
(all laugh)

02:18:22.531 --> 02:18:25.103
TALIESIN: I rolled a 23.

02:18:25.103 --> 02:18:31.851
MATT: While the rest of you end up taking your
evening's rest, Grog, you immediately snap your

02:18:31.851 --> 02:18:34.665
hammock and fall 15 feet to the ground.

02:18:34.665 --> 02:18:37.804
TRAVIS: (pained groan)

02:18:37.804 --> 02:18:41.672
MATT: But you manage to make your way up there and
just bear hug the tree trunk for rest. You're used

02:18:41.672 --> 02:18:43.106
to sleeping in uncomfortable situations.

02:18:43.106 --> 02:18:45.901
LIAM: I throw five or six pine cones at his head.

02:18:45.901 --> 02:18:48.342
MATT: Over time, or at once?

02:18:48.342 --> 02:18:49.515
LIAM: At once.

02:18:49.515 --> 02:18:54.908
TRAVIS: Fucking gravity.

02:18:54.908 --> 02:19:01.608
MATT: You manage to complete three pieces of
parchment, roughly page-sized, with your black

02:19:01.608 --> 02:19:08.350
powder treatment, successfully. The mist rolls in
and gets thicker and thicker, to the point where

02:19:08.350 --> 02:19:14.927
you cannot see the floor of the forest. The little
bit of moonlight that manages to make its way

02:19:14.927 --> 02:19:21.757
through the boughs of the trees trickles through
and then vanishes into these slowly-shifting bits

02:19:21.816 --> 02:19:27.594
of fog. Your breath, every time you exhale, is
visible, as the cold night air begins to take. You

02:19:27.594 --> 02:19:31.936
find yourselves instinctively shivering, as you
cannot grow close to each other for heat, nor

02:19:31.936 --> 02:19:38.576
build a fire. The night, while uncomfortable, you
do manage to get an evening's bit of

02:19:38.576 --> 02:19:44.934
mostly uncomfortable rest, but rest nonetheless.
Eventually coming to as the morning sun comes up

02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:51.775
and heats it up, the fog begins to fade away and
burn away. You're at about an hour past sunrise as

02:19:51.775 --> 02:19:57.163
you all unrestfully come to consciousness as the
temperature shift hits. You manage to relieve

02:19:57.163 --> 02:20:06.533
yourselves of your spider silk-based hammocks
and/or tree grasping. Both you and Trinket have

02:20:06.533 --> 02:20:13.368
found this way of clutching onto the tree.
Trinket's used to the wild.

02:20:13.368 --> 02:20:14.759
TRAVIS: This is, like, sunup, right?

02:20:14.759 --> 02:20:16.720
MATT: It's about seven, 7:30 in the morning.

02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:22.385
SAM: Can I do a quick scry back to the poo jar
that I left back in our kitchen?

02:20:22.385 --> 02:20:23.522
MATT: Certainly.

02:20:23.522 --> 02:20:25.199
SAM: Just to make sure that our home base is
okay.

02:20:25.199 --> 02:20:29.130
MATT: You take a moment and concentrate on the
kitchen. At this point in time, you can see early

02:20:29.130 --> 02:20:38.629
morning. Laina is currently in there, yawning, and is
cleaning about and starting to make a small

02:20:38.713 --> 02:20:43.529
breakfast for all the guards. You can hear in the
distance, some conversation in the distant room.

02:20:43.529 --> 02:20:47.695
It appears to be a couple of your various employed
mercenaries

02:20:47.695 --> 02:20:50.726
having a conversation as she's making breakfast.

02:20:50.726 --> 02:20:51.657
SAM: So they're fine.

02:20:51.657 --> 02:20:52.577
MATT: They seem fine.

02:20:52.577 --> 02:20:56.004
SAM: So I knock that one off, and I'll try for
Pike.

02:20:56.004 --> 02:21:00.540
MATT: Okay. Concentrating on Pike-- about two
minutes of hard concentration.

02:21:00.540 --> 02:21:02.845
There's no connection.

02:21:02.845 --> 02:21:05.186
SAM: They wiped my poo away.

02:21:05.186 --> 02:21:10.532
MATT: You gather, due to the relatively fresh and
unstable nature of this potion you had concocted,

02:21:10.532 --> 02:21:16.836
you can only have one source connection up at a
time, so when you left it in your keep, it seems

02:21:16.836 --> 02:21:22.762
that the one you had at the temple of Sarenrae was
alleviated of its magical presence. What was once

02:21:22.762 --> 02:21:27.981
a magical scry poo is literally just Scan-scat at
the temple.

02:21:27.981 --> 02:21:30.556
SAM: Which some could argue is magical in its own
right.

02:21:30.556 --> 02:21:32.438
MATT: Sure enough. With a high enough persuasion
roll.

02:21:32.438 --> 02:21:33.807
LAURA: Teacher. Teacher.

02:21:33.807 --> 02:21:35.822
TALIESIN: Does it change color when it loses its
power?

02:21:35.822 --> 02:21:36.685
MATT: You don't know.

02:21:36.685 --> 02:21:38.457
TALIESIN: Damn it! I want to know.

02:21:38.457 --> 02:21:39.834
SAM: Only one way to find out.

02:21:39.834 --> 02:21:40.821
TALIESIN: God damn it.

02:21:40.821 --> 02:21:43.229
MATT: Ask Pike when you see her again. (laughs)

02:21:43.229 --> 02:21:48.863
TALIESIN: Your poo power may come in very handy.
This is good to know.

02:21:48.863 --> 02:21:52.865
TRAVIS: Let's go find an abandoned building and
set up.

02:21:52.865 --> 02:21:55.955
LIAM: Could we throw in a Scanlan grenade and be
able to see through it?

02:21:55.955 --> 02:21:58.053
SAM: Sure.

02:21:58.053 --> 02:21:59.619
TALIESIN: A scat grenade.

02:21:59.619 --> 02:22:00.762
LIAM: A scat grenade.

02:22:00.762 --> 02:22:01.540
SAM: Sure.

02:22:01.540 --> 02:22:02.330
LIAM: Scatlan.

02:22:02.330 --> 02:22:03.975
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Scatlan!

02:22:03.975 --> 02:22:06.820
SAM: I could get in, shit in their bedroom, and
leave.

02:22:06.820 --> 02:22:08.536
LIAM: You shit in your hand, and you toss it.

02:22:08.536 --> 02:22:10.909
SAM: Oh, yeah. That, too! Pull the pin.

02:22:10.909 --> 02:22:17.158
(all laugh)

02:22:17.158 --> 02:22:19.088
LAURA: Yeah. Remember that. That's awesome.

02:22:19.088 --> 02:22:21.225
TRAVIS: This is what happens.

02:22:21.225 --> 02:22:22.962
LAURA: You could fly overhead with Keyleth.

02:22:22.962 --> 02:22:23.847
SAM: Yes?

02:22:23.847 --> 02:22:25.611
LAURA: Drop it like a bomb!

02:22:25.611 --> 02:22:27.819
SAM: And then we'd have eyes in there.

02:22:27.819 --> 02:22:29.674
LAURA: I like it.

02:22:29.674 --> 02:22:32.277
SAM: I like this a lot. Give me something to eat.

02:22:32.277 --> 02:22:34.659
MARISHA: What?

02:22:34.659 --> 02:22:36.068
SAM: I need some fuel.

02:22:36.068 --> 02:22:37.102
TRAVIS: Holy crap.

02:22:37.102 --> 02:22:38.314
LAURA: I have a sweet potato right here, Scanlan.

02:22:38.314 --> 02:22:41.703
SAM: Sweet potato? That's good, yes. Some prunes?

02:22:41.703 --> 02:22:43.470
MARISHA: Yeah, something hearty.

02:22:43.470 --> 02:22:45.069
LIAM: All right. We're off the rails.

02:22:45.069 --> 02:22:47.207
TRAVIS: Step one of this.

02:22:47.207 --> 02:22:54.161
MATT: So, you make your way down into the forest.
About another hour and a half of travel before you

02:22:54.161 --> 02:22:59.896
start getting to where the trees begin to clear up
a little bit, and you can see the base of the

02:22:59.896 --> 02:23:08.158
cleared-off mountain that Whitestone Castle is built
upon, and the pathway that descends into the outer

02:23:08.232 --> 02:23:11.557
wall of the city of Whitestone.

02:23:11.557 --> 02:23:14.385
LAURA: How far of a travel is it down into the
city?

02:23:14.385 --> 02:23:19.103
MATT: It's maybe a quarter mile.

02:23:19.103 --> 02:23:21.591
LAURA: So we can do that a little amount of time.

02:23:21.591 --> 02:23:24.485
MATT: Space-relation-wise, you guys are just
getting to this side of the forest right there.

02:23:24.485 --> 02:23:29.487
Right there, and this is the mountain.

02:23:29.487 --> 02:23:32.122
LAURA: So if we're going to try stealth this shit
in--

02:23:32.122 --> 02:23:33.676
TRAVIS: Do we take the stealthy one or the
invisible one?

02:23:33.676 --> 02:23:34.485
SAM: Wait.

02:23:34.485 --> 02:23:38.250
MARISHA: Wait. Wait. Which plan are we doing
first?

02:23:38.250 --> 02:23:39.942
TRAVIS: First part is getting an abandoned
building.

02:23:39.942 --> 02:23:42.135
LAURA: So that we can be near the tree to protect
you.

02:23:42.135 --> 02:23:43.697
SAM: So that we can be townspeople.

02:23:43.697 --> 02:23:44.610
MARISHA: Okay.

02:23:44.610 --> 02:23:45.828
SAM: Right?

02:23:45.828 --> 02:23:46.984
TALIESIN: So you can get a beret.

02:23:46.984 --> 02:23:48.438
TRAVIS: Abandoned building, part one.

02:23:48.438 --> 02:23:49.818
SAM: We're setting up shop.

02:23:49.818 --> 02:23:51.242
LAURA: Get into the town.

02:23:51.242 --> 02:23:53.421
TRAVIS: So who goes and finds the abandoned
building?

02:23:53.421 --> 02:23:55.054
SAM: Percy is known here.

02:23:55.054 --> 02:24:00.089
TALIESIN: Which is why I'm going to be wearing-- I
haven't been seen in years, and when I was seen, I

02:24:00.089 --> 02:24:02.898
was much younger, and honestly--

02:24:02.898 --> 02:24:05.307
MARISHA: Yes, but the Briarwoods knew who you
were.

02:24:05.307 --> 02:24:07.358
TALIESIN: I had different hair. Yes, they do.

02:24:07.358 --> 02:24:08.487
MARISHA: The Briarwoods recognized you instantly.

02:24:08.487 --> 02:24:10.797
TALIESIN: They did, which was disorienting.

02:24:10.797 --> 02:24:12.556
SAM: But they're not on sentry duty.

02:24:12.556 --> 02:24:15.212
TRAVIS: We need a forward operating base, so who
wants to be stealthy or invisible

02:24:15.274 --> 02:24:16.591
and find an empty building?

02:24:16.591 --> 02:24:24.014
LIAM: Question: for the Assassin path of rogue, at
9th level, if I have seven days, which is way too

02:24:24.014 --> 02:24:31.607
much time, I can impersonate anyone I want. In
half a day, could I just be a dirty nobody?

02:24:31.607 --> 02:24:33.858
MATT: Yeah. You'd be able to disguise yourself.

02:24:33.858 --> 02:24:35.137
SAM: We also have the hat.

02:24:35.137 --> 02:24:36.097
MATT: The disguise kit?

02:24:36.097 --> 02:24:40.740
SAM: His hat of disguise. Percy knows this town.
Perhaps Percy should wear the hat.

02:24:40.805 --> 02:24:42.593
TRAVIS: Does it require attunement?

02:24:42.593 --> 02:24:43.812
SAM: Just a few minutes, I think.

02:24:43.812 --> 02:24:45.315
TALIESIN: I already have the hat.

02:24:45.315 --> 02:24:47.474
SAM: Yes, you had it from the dinner party.

02:24:47.474 --> 02:24:54.613
TALIESIN: I've been trying to think of what sorts
of buildings would be the most defensible and the

02:24:54.613 --> 02:25:00.828
least likely to arouse suspicion. Things with
basements?

02:25:00.828 --> 02:25:08.272
MATT: A lot of the houses have basements. There
are varying degrees of it. There are larger

02:25:08.272 --> 02:25:14.426
homesteads that were reserved for the actual
nobles that ran the day-to-day life of Whitestone

02:25:14.426 --> 02:25:20.359
when your family was in power. As you heard from
Desmond, probably the places where the new nobles

02:25:20.359 --> 02:25:25.222
live. Those are the ones that have the gates
surrounding them: the larger homesteads scattered

02:25:25.222 --> 02:25:26.396
throughout the town.

02:25:26.396 --> 02:25:27.533
TALIESIN: That's too obvious.

02:25:27.533 --> 02:25:32.008
MATT: It's far too obvious. There are many small
abodes and even some farm-based hovels. The poor

02:25:32.008 --> 02:25:37.602
end of town is the farming side, which is the
southwest, which is the closest area to where you

02:25:37.602 --> 02:25:40.472
guys made your stop earlier.

02:25:40.472 --> 02:25:44.416
TALIESIN: I would almost say a shopping district.
If there's an abandoned storefront.

02:25:44.416 --> 02:25:48.357
MATT: The shopping district is the center of town
around the town square.

02:25:48.357 --> 02:25:49.756
LAURA: Around the Sun Tree?

02:25:49.756 --> 02:25:52.074
MATT: Yeah. Right there.

02:25:52.074 --> 02:25:54.729
TALIESIN: Might be too close.

02:25:54.729 --> 02:26:03.218
SAM: Before we go marching in there, finding an
abode to live in is not going to be too difficult.

02:26:03.218 --> 02:26:05.649
We'll need food.

02:26:05.649 --> 02:26:07.425
LAURA: Are we living in there?!

02:26:07.425 --> 02:26:08.467
SAM: Yes.

02:26:08.467 --> 02:26:09.728
TALIESIN: We're not going to be there for long.

02:26:09.728 --> 02:26:10.917
TRAVIS: We have dried food rations.

02:26:10.917 --> 02:26:12.434
TALIESIN: We have food rations. We have options.

02:26:12.434 --> 02:26:14.927
LAURA: We've got food for days.

02:26:14.927 --> 02:26:16.294
SAM: We might be there for days and days.

02:26:16.294 --> 02:26:17.254
LAURA: We've got food for days.

02:26:17.254 --> 02:26:18.394
TRAVIS: We've got dried food rations.

02:26:18.394 --> 02:26:23.875
SAM: We also have to go around town and, forgive
me if I'm going too far with your plan here, but

02:26:23.875 --> 02:26:26.886
aren't we trying to win allies among the people?

02:26:26.886 --> 02:26:28.281
TALIESIN: I have a plan.

02:26:28.281 --> 02:26:30.762
SAM: But we'll need to communicate with them.
How?

02:26:30.762 --> 02:26:31.460
LAURA: He has a plan.

02:26:31.460 --> 02:26:32.598
TRAVIS: He has a plan.

02:26:32.598 --> 02:26:34.230
SAM: (sighs) All right.

02:26:34.230 --> 02:26:36.990
TRAVIS: Come on. Drop your pants and get with the
plan.

02:26:36.990 --> 02:26:39.176
MARISHA: What time is it? Have we gone to sleep,
or are we waking up?

02:26:39.176 --> 02:26:43.530
MATT: You guys are awake. After this discussion,
I'd say it's about 8:00 in the morning. 8:30.

02:26:43.530 --> 02:26:44.778
TALIESIN: Let's make our way in.

02:26:44.778 --> 02:26:45.597
LIAM: This is the time.

02:26:45.597 --> 02:26:46.604
LAURA: We should stealth in.

02:26:46.604 --> 02:26:47.865
MARISHA: Are we doing the tree thing right now?

02:26:47.865 --> 02:26:50.296
MATT: Actually, your travel to the city and you're
on the outskirts of it now.

02:26:50.296 --> 02:26:51.820
It would be closer to 9:30.

02:26:51.820 --> 02:26:53.442
MARISHA: Okay.

02:26:53.442 --> 02:26:55.040
LAURA: Yeah. We try to get in.

02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:59.529
TALIESIN: We find a place to at least set up our
operation.

02:26:59.529 --> 02:27:03.237
MARISHA: Well, that's what I was going to say. Do
we want to find operations, try and recoup--

02:27:03.237 --> 02:27:06.897
LIAM: We don't really know what we're going to
find this morning. Those big guys could still be

02:27:06.897 --> 02:27:08.119
there; we don't know.

02:27:08.119 --> 02:27:09.245
TALIESIN: We don't.

02:27:09.245 --> 02:27:12.787
LIAM: We don't know if there are people in the
pocket of the Briarwoods here.

02:27:12.787 --> 02:27:14.561
TRAVIS: It's like 12% of a plan.

02:27:14.561 --> 02:27:18.402
MARISHA: If we take a day to get in and get
settled, I can do a Heroes' Feast and then I start

02:27:18.402 --> 02:27:20.720
crack of dawn in the morning?

02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:22.332
LIAM: I think that's a good idea.

02:27:22.332 --> 02:27:23.951
TALIESIN: Let's get in and set up.

02:27:23.951 --> 02:27:26.848
LIAM: Hole up. Let's find a place.

02:27:26.848 --> 02:27:28.413
MARISHA: All right.

02:27:28.413 --> 02:27:30.843
SAM: Wait, we're just going to walk into the
city?

02:27:30.843 --> 02:27:32.394
TALIESIN: No, we're going to stealth into the
city.

02:27:32.394 --> 02:27:33.170
SAM: Okay.

02:27:33.170 --> 02:27:34.681
LAURA: We're going to cast Pass Without a Trace on
everybody.

02:27:34.681 --> 02:27:35.755
MATT: Okay.

02:27:35.755 --> 02:27:37.887
SAM: Beard check?

02:27:37.887 --> 02:27:39.040
TRAVIS: That was an eight.

02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:40.613
MATT: Stealth?

02:27:40.613 --> 02:27:42.243
TRAVIS: Beard check.

02:27:42.301 --> 02:27:50.034
MATT: Oh. (laughs) Your beard is pretty much at
the fullest it'll ever be. You gather you can

02:27:50.034 --> 02:27:53.944
probably get a little more thickness to it, but
your beard is at maximum, Grog. The fact that you

02:27:53.944 --> 02:27:56.906
even have a goliath with a beard is a feat of
magic in its own right.

02:27:56.906 --> 02:27:57.967
TRAVIS: Amazing.

02:27:57.967 --> 02:27:59.085
LIAM: You would be a freak.

02:27:59.085 --> 02:28:01.824
TRAVIS: Is it like that Vidal Sassoon commercial?
Whip it.

02:28:01.824 --> 02:28:02.733
MARISHA: That's dope.

02:28:02.733 --> 02:28:03.797
TALIESIN: Isn't that dope?

02:28:03.797 --> 02:28:08.475
SAM: Grog, I've heard that no one in this town
wears a beard.

02:28:08.475 --> 02:28:10.392
LAURA: Oh, natural 20 on stealth!

02:28:10.392 --> 02:28:14.019
TRAVIS: You can forget it. I won't go in.

02:28:14.019 --> 02:28:17.652
MATT: So you guys are traveling as a group. I need
stealth checks from everybody.

02:28:17.652 --> 02:28:21.781
TALIESIN: Do we have Pass Without a Trace?

02:28:21.781 --> 02:28:22.789
LAURA: Yeah.

02:28:22.789 --> 02:28:24.989
MARISHA: Can we each take a little bit of time to
look more like commoners?

02:28:24.989 --> 02:28:26.179
TALIESIN: I'm wearing my hat, too.

02:28:26.179 --> 02:28:28.442
TRAVIS: Look like commoners?

02:28:28.442 --> 02:28:30.084
SAM: I rub dirt all over my face.

02:28:30.084 --> 02:28:32.331
TRAVIS: Shit, I'm a goliath.

02:28:32.331 --> 02:28:33.425
LAURA: Plus, we have a bear.

02:28:33.425 --> 02:28:35.140
SAM: You should try to look less handsome.

02:28:35.140 --> 02:28:37.907
MARISHA: Yeah, we do look like quite the motley
crew.

02:28:37.907 --> 02:28:39.371
LIAM: I'm wearing a natural 20.

02:28:39.371 --> 02:28:40.335
SAM: Okay.

02:28:40.335 --> 02:28:42.640
MATT: Did you roll a natural 20, as well?

02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:43.524
LIAM: I did.

02:28:43.524 --> 02:28:44.862
MATT: Both of you guys rolled natural 20s in
stealth?

02:28:44.862 --> 02:28:47.491
LIAM: Had a little help with Luck, but I got it.

02:28:47.551 --> 02:28:48.988
MATT: There you go.

02:28:48.988 --> 02:28:50.365
TALIESIN: That's really good, because I rolled a
one.

02:28:50.365 --> 02:28:51.679
LAURA: Oh no.

02:28:51.679 --> 02:28:53.736
SAM: We've got Pass Without a Trace, so 28.

02:28:53.736 --> 02:28:55.023
TALIESIN: 11.

02:28:55.023 --> 02:28:55.899
MARISHA: Still a failure.

02:28:55.899 --> 02:28:57.560
TRAVIS: Are we all going together? Are we not
sending one person in

02:28:57.560 --> 02:28:59.355
to go find an empty building?

02:28:59.355 --> 02:29:00.817
SAM: We're all going together.

02:29:00.817 --> 02:29:04.750
MATT: You guys are all going together. You dirty
yourselves up a bit. You're still a large goliath.

02:29:04.750 --> 02:29:07.284
You're still a few half-elves, a gnome.

02:29:07.284 --> 02:29:08.612
LAURA: There's still a bear.

02:29:08.612 --> 02:29:11.136
MATT: Outside of illusion magic, you're still
going to stick out like a sore thumb.

02:29:11.136 --> 02:29:12.561
LAURA: Could we cast illusion magic? Do we have
it?

02:29:12.561 --> 02:29:13.988
SAM: What's illusion magic?

02:29:13.988 --> 02:29:16.660
LIAM: I'm walking 50 feet in front of everybody
else.

02:29:16.660 --> 02:29:18.407
LAURA: Seeming! To make Grog and Trinket look like
commoners.

02:29:18.407 --> 02:29:20.491
LIAM: I'm 50 feet in front of everyone else.

02:29:20.491 --> 02:29:21.515
LAURA: Yeah, do that!

02:29:21.515 --> 02:29:23.316
MARISHA: Oh, yeah! Seeming us?

02:29:23.316 --> 02:29:26.129
SAM: Sure. All right. I will cast Seeming on us.

02:29:26.129 --> 02:29:29.239
MATT: This is a legit use of Seeming, too. Okay.

02:29:29.239 --> 02:29:31.111
SAM: We'll all look like dirty--

02:29:31.111 --> 02:29:34.024
MARISHA: As opposed to the cows? Come on.

02:29:34.024 --> 02:29:36.101
SAM: -- dirty, ragged peasants.

02:29:36.101 --> 02:29:37.250
MATT: Trinket, as well?

02:29:37.250 --> 02:29:37.972
LAURA: Yes.

02:29:37.972 --> 02:29:39.541
TALIESIN: Trinket looks like a donkey.

02:29:39.541 --> 02:29:40.909
LAURA: No, he'll just be a really drunk peasant.

02:29:40.909 --> 02:29:42.751
MARISHA: A donkey. A mule.

02:29:42.751 --> 02:29:45.231
SAM: Can I just say this? Can we just leave
Trinket behind--

02:29:45.231 --> 02:29:46.250
LAURA: No!

02:29:46.250 --> 02:29:48.616
SAM: I don't want to walk in there with a bear!

02:29:48.616 --> 02:29:51.619
LAURA: He'll look like a fucking donkey, or he'll
look like another commoner.

02:29:51.619 --> 02:29:54.055
SAM: I think I can only make us all look the
same.

02:29:54.055 --> 02:29:55.494
LAURA: Then he'll look like a fucking commoner.

02:29:55.494 --> 02:30:00.826
MATT: Of similar size. I believe, as far as
Seeming is concerned-- If not, then I'll allow it

02:30:00.826 --> 02:30:01.937
for the purposes of this.

02:30:01.937 --> 02:30:02.865
LAURA: He'll look like a commoner--

02:30:02.865 --> 02:30:03.311
MARISHA: A Clydesdale!

02:30:03.311 --> 02:30:04.690
LAURA: -- a weird commoner.

02:30:04.690 --> 02:30:05.482
TRAVIS: Leave the bear.

02:30:05.482 --> 02:30:06.444
TALIESIN: A milk cow!

02:30:06.444 --> 02:30:09.481
LAURA: I'm not leaving a fucking bear on the
outside of town where there's hounds around, and

02:30:09.481 --> 02:30:12.186
there's fucking vampires and birds flying around,
fuck you!

02:30:12.186 --> 02:30:15.122
SAM: Oh, wait, no! You can give each target a new
appearance.

02:30:15.122 --> 02:30:16.358
MATT: Yep!

02:30:16.358 --> 02:30:18.241
SAM: So I can make everyone look a little
different.

02:30:18.241 --> 02:30:21.603
MATT: Each creature can seem a foot shorter or
taller, or appear thin, fat, or in between.

02:30:21.603 --> 02:30:23.294
MARISHA: Make him look like a milk cow.

02:30:23.294 --> 02:30:26.489
MATT: You can't change their body type. So,
Trinket will still be a four-legged creature, but

02:30:26.489 --> 02:30:28.257
you can make him look like a different four-legged
creature.

02:30:28.257 --> 02:30:29.284
LAURA: There you go!

02:30:29.284 --> 02:30:30.363
SAM: Okay. He's a milk cow.

02:30:30.363 --> 02:30:33.685
LIAM: Real talk, real talk, Scanlan. My sister
will cut you.

02:30:33.685 --> 02:30:36.432
TRAVIS: Or do you want him to be a donkey,
something we can move.

02:30:36.432 --> 02:30:37.326
Milk cows are slow.

02:30:37.326 --> 02:30:37.989
LIAM: Bring the bear.

02:30:37.989 --> 02:30:38.541
TALIESIN: Donkeys can move more quickly. This is
true.

02:30:38.735 --> 02:30:39.927
SAM: All right. Donkey.

02:30:39.927 --> 02:30:40.660
LAURA: All right.

02:30:40.660 --> 02:30:41.728
SAM: He's an ass.

02:30:41.728 --> 02:30:42.875
MATT: All right, so Trinket takes on the form of a
donkey.

02:30:42.875 --> 02:30:44.154
LAURA: (laughs) So are you darling, so are you.

02:30:44.154 --> 02:30:45.447
TRAVIS: Just like her owner.

02:30:45.447 --> 02:30:47.649
MATT: The rest of you are a smattering of various
humanoids, you--

02:30:47.649 --> 02:30:49.098
LAURA: (fake coughing)

02:30:49.098 --> 02:30:52.653
SAM: I make myself look like a weird hunchback,
sort of, not all there.

02:30:52.653 --> 02:30:57.481
MATT: Okay, so you guys look like pretty
rough peasants, dirty faces. You know, hair a

02:30:57.560 --> 02:31:03.542
little razzled. It looks like you've been living
the harsh life on the outskirts of the slums of

02:31:03.542 --> 02:31:05.045
Whitestone for quite some time--

02:31:05.045 --> 02:31:06.329
TRAVIS: I wanted to be a model.

02:31:06.329 --> 02:31:08.125
MATT: -- with a donkey.

02:31:08.125 --> 02:31:09.900
TALIESIN: (goat bleat)

02:31:09.900 --> 02:31:14.799
MATT: So. You guys, utilizing your stealth checks
and the Seeming, you make your way up to the--

02:31:14.799 --> 02:31:16.212
which side of Whitestone are you coming in from?

02:31:16.212 --> 02:31:17.591
TALIESIN: Thank you for the double 20.

02:31:17.591 --> 02:31:18.396
MATT: Percy?

02:31:18.396 --> 02:31:19.148
LAURA: Where are we coming up?

02:31:19.148 --> 02:31:20.098
TALIESIN: Coming in from the west.

02:31:20.098 --> 02:31:23.764
MATT: Okay, so you come into this entrance here.
You make your way into the center of town,

02:31:23.764 --> 02:31:32.893
blending in best you can. There are a few folks
who see you enter, just give you a strange look.

02:31:32.893 --> 02:31:43.262
You all are unfamiliar to the denizens of
Whitestone--

02:31:43.262 --> 02:31:44.299
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

02:31:44.299 --> 02:31:49.354
MATT: -- but you don't look like a threat, per se.
So you are noticed, and some people seem to just

02:31:49.354 --> 02:31:54.897
stop and watch you pass, but no one seems to make
any active mention, note,

02:31:54.897 --> 02:31:56.821
or change in behavior towards it.

02:31:56.821 --> 02:31:58.753
TRAVIS: Are we checking buildings while we're
walking through?

02:31:58.753 --> 02:32:01.705
LAURA: I have passive perception of 21; I'm always
looking.

02:32:01.705 --> 02:32:10.118
LIAM: I walk over to just one random person on the
street and say, anyone hiring hands? On farms?

02:32:10.118 --> 02:32:11.861
LAURA: Our farm burned down!

02:32:11.861 --> 02:32:20.022
MATT: (laughs) Make a deception roll. I'll give
you advantage on it because the Seeming does give

02:32:20.022 --> 02:32:25.162
you the visual perspective of being close to their
type.

02:32:25.162 --> 02:32:29.086
LIAM: That is a four-- No, hold on--

02:32:29.086 --> 02:32:30.010
LAURA: No, no, no.

02:32:30.010 --> 02:32:31.293
LIAM: I'm gonna use Luck, that's the Luck.

02:32:31.293 --> 02:32:32.427
TRAVIS: Was the first number gonna be a 40?

02:32:32.427 --> 02:32:35.820
LIAM: No, it's not 40. So it's 14.

02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:37.623
MATT: Okay. That's two Luck rolls, by the way,
that you've spent.

02:32:37.623 --> 02:32:39.224
LIAM: Yeah, I know.

02:32:39.224 --> 02:32:47.510
MATT: The woman you approach who's probably in her
early 30s, pale blonde hair, looks like she

02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:51.661
actually might be losing it in some places, gives
you a look and goes,

02:32:51.661 --> 02:32:56.056
"You poor people shouldn't be here."

02:32:56.056 --> 02:32:58.456
LIAM: We just need some work.

02:32:58.456 --> 02:33:04.958
MATT: "You'll find it, but you're not going
anywhere else. Welcome to Whitestone." She turns

02:33:04.958 --> 02:33:11.291
around and walks back, joining arms with
apparently a man that she's paired with, and the

02:33:11.291 --> 02:33:18.458
two of them just walk away, a bit dumbfounded that
people walked into Whitestone. As this happens,

02:33:18.458 --> 02:33:24.960
you glance over your shoulder and you see coming
from the northern edge from this side wall--

02:33:24.960 --> 02:33:28.465
(sounds of booming footsteps)

02:33:28.465 --> 02:33:30.097
LAURA: Oh, we should avoid that shit!

02:33:30.097 --> 02:33:37.627
MATT: A very tall, noticeably undead giant with
its jaw broken off and hanging from the hinge,

02:33:37.627 --> 02:33:43.120
dried, caked blood across its chest, it's just
dragging this large club behind it.

02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:45.187
LIAM: Where are we? What are our surroundings
right now?

02:33:45.187 --> 02:33:49.406
MATT: You right now, you're in a T. To the right
and left are roads that go along the inside of the

02:33:49.406 --> 02:33:54.054
wall that surrounds Whitestone, to the front of
you is the path that leads further into the city.

02:33:54.054 --> 02:33:55.156
LAURA: Let's go into the city!

02:33:55.156 --> 02:33:55.916
TRAVIS: We casually begin--

02:33:55.916 --> 02:34:00.063
TALIESIN: I wanna head through the city, possibly
in the direction of the cemetery.

02:34:00.063 --> 02:34:02.048
MATT: Cemetery's over here.

02:34:02.048 --> 02:34:03.350
TALIESIN: Yeah, I wanna head in that direction.

02:34:03.350 --> 02:34:05.033
MATT: All right. So you guys make your way
through--

02:34:05.033 --> 02:34:08.354
LAURA: Keeping an eye out for, you know, buildings
that look clustered

02:34:08.354 --> 02:34:10.355
and abandoned that we can hide in.

02:34:10.355 --> 02:34:11.895
TALIESIN: What's changed?

02:34:11.895 --> 02:34:21.078
MATT: What you've noticed has changed is, one:
largely, the population is far more sparse than

02:34:21.078 --> 02:34:25.524
you recall. What was once a bustling city, you're now
seeing about half as many people as you would

02:34:25.524 --> 02:34:31.046
would see this time of day. Going through,
everyone seems to be in relatively poor health.

02:34:31.125 --> 02:34:43.236
There are a few buildings that look long-term
abandoned, immediately in this area here, in the

02:34:43.236 --> 02:34:49.574
outskirts, catches your guys' eye. You do notice
that the corner lamps that you had set up at the

02:34:49.574 --> 02:34:55.101
different corners of the streets appear to be
shattered.

02:34:56.701 --> 02:34:57.819
TRAVIS: Interesting.

02:34:57.819 --> 02:35:04.048
MATT: There would be like, you know, glass oil
lanterns that at night someone would go around and

02:35:04.048 --> 02:35:10.690
light them after the sunset. The posts that hold
them now are all either broken, or the glass

02:35:10.766 --> 02:35:14.264
itself has been shattered.

02:35:16.465 --> 02:35:18.960
MARISHA: They want it to be really dark.

02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:22.701
TALIESIN: They want it to be really dark. I'm also
thinking about that cemetery.

02:35:22.701 --> 02:35:27.447
SAM: We're not gonna live in a cemetery, that's
super creepy.

02:35:27.447 --> 02:35:30.834
MARISHA: As opposed to all of the other things
we've done?

02:35:30.962 --> 02:35:32.350
TALIESIN: Everything here is super creepy.

02:35:32.350 --> 02:35:34.907
LAURA: Is there any other abandoned buildings
around?

02:35:34.907 --> 02:35:36.371
MARISHA: As opposed to sleeping in the Underdark?

02:35:36.371 --> 02:35:39.913
MATT: There are plenty of buildings that look dark
and mostly untouched in this section here, as you

02:35:39.913 --> 02:35:41.431
begin to move closer and closer inward.

02:35:41.431 --> 02:35:45.823
TALIESIN: Let's get east of the center square and
set up camp.

02:35:45.823 --> 02:35:47.882
LAURA: Okay. Where's the castle? Is it on the top
of the--

02:35:47.882 --> 02:35:48.810
TRAVIS: It's north.

02:35:48.810 --> 02:35:51.001
LAURA: Oh, it's that thingy? Okay.

02:35:51.001 --> 02:35:52.393
SAM: We're trying to shoot for here?

02:35:52.393 --> 02:36:03.704
MATT: Okay. You guys move this way, as you push
towards the center of this here. You--

02:36:05.378 --> 02:36:06.899
SAM: You speak Giant, Grog?

02:36:06.899 --> 02:36:07.982
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:36:07.982 --> 02:36:11.540
MATT: You move past the center here and to the
left of you, you can see the town square and there

02:36:11.540 --> 02:36:19.044
it is, the Sun Tree. Very, very large, you imagine
beautiful tree at one time, full height was

02:36:19.044 --> 02:36:28.393
probably about 40 feet tall. The branches twist
out, and almost look like they're hanging loosely,

02:36:28.393 --> 02:36:31.994
the ends, everything looks droopy and desolate;
there's not a leaf on it.

02:36:31.994 --> 02:36:35.046
MARISHA: Can I do some sort of a check from a
distance to see if I can recognize

02:36:35.046 --> 02:36:37.480
what kind of tree it is?

02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:39.947
MATT: Make a nature check.

02:36:41.249 --> 02:36:42.494
MARISHA: 18.

02:36:42.494 --> 02:36:47.941
MATT: Okay. It's hard to tell from this distance,
there are a number of types of trees it could be.

02:36:47.941 --> 02:36:52.900
It's not indigenous to this land. The fact that it
grew here means that either it was transplanted,

02:36:52.900 --> 02:36:55.415
or it was some sort of--

02:36:55.415 --> 02:36:56.235
MARISHA: Magical grower.

02:36:56.235 --> 02:36:57.483
LAURA: (sings) Divine Intervention!

02:36:57.483 --> 02:36:59.374
MATT: -- magical creation for its presence.

02:36:59.374 --> 02:37:01.634
MARISHA: Okay.

02:37:01.634 --> 02:37:08.718
MATT: And you do see the silhouette of the eight
figures slowly swaying from beneath the branches.

02:37:08.718 --> 02:37:13.958
TRAVIS: We continue on. Don't pay too much
attention to it. Find a place to post up.

02:37:13.958 --> 02:37:15.437
MARISHA: Right. Don't get emotional.

02:37:15.437 --> 02:37:21.424
LAURA: If you, if you do your nature-y spell from
inside a building, does it still do the same thing

02:37:21.424 --> 02:37:23.327
or do you have to be next to the tree while you're
doing it?

02:37:23.327 --> 02:37:25.521
TRAVIS: That's a large radius, right?

02:37:25.521 --> 02:37:30.722
MARISHA: So the way the spell works, I can do it
one of two ways. I can do it instantaneously,

02:37:30.722 --> 02:37:38.750
essentially grow up a whole bunch of plants and
brush and shrubbery around me, or I can wait and I

02:37:38.750 --> 02:37:43.615
can concentrate for a while and instill a plant
with vibrant--

02:37:43.615 --> 02:37:44.732
LAURA: Okay.

02:37:44.732 --> 02:37:49.366
MARISHA: -- life energy and heal the farmlands and
it would stretch out for a really far radius.

02:37:49.366 --> 02:37:50.350
LAURA: Let's keep moving.

02:37:50.350 --> 02:37:51.827
MARISHA: I'm gonna probably wanna do more the
second one.

02:37:51.827 --> 02:37:52.478
LAURA: Okay.

02:37:52.478 --> 02:37:53.473
TRAVIS: Do it from inside a house.

02:37:53.473 --> 02:37:56.405
MATT: Did you guys want keep moving down this
path, to go through the square, closer to the

02:37:56.405 --> 02:37:57.911
tree, do you want to go southward?

02:37:57.911 --> 02:37:59.130
MARISHA: I don't know, it's a central point.

02:37:59.130 --> 02:38:00.256
LAURA: We avoid the tree a little bit and just
keep going straight.

02:38:00.256 --> 02:38:01.240
MATT: Okay, so you're going this way.

02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:02.089
LAURA: Yeah?

02:38:02.089 --> 02:38:04.599
LIAM: There's a larger building, isn't there? I
can't see--

02:38:04.599 --> 02:38:09.520
TALIESIN: Actually, I would say let's get a good
look at the tree, let's walk by it.

02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:11.815
SAM: Oh, we're gonna walk by the tree?

02:38:11.815 --> 02:38:16.057
MARISHA: Look like it's no big deal.

02:38:16.057 --> 02:38:17.202
TRAVIS: I know.

02:38:17.202 --> 02:38:21.822
MATT: You guys turn left, and you make your way
towards the town square. And as you enter the

02:38:21.822 --> 02:38:31.200
square, looking around, you can see there are what
would have been carts and small booths set up for

02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:39.051
selling of meats and other goods, what was a
small, you know, barter-and-sale based hub of this

02:38:39.051 --> 02:38:43.427
town-- nowhere near on the scale of Emon's bazaar,
but you know, enough to support this town--

02:38:43.427 --> 02:38:54.918
desolate. All look to be closed down and untouched
for quite some time. As you get a closer look to

02:38:54.918 --> 02:38:58.439
the-- actually I'm gonna have you guys all roll
perception checks.

02:38:58.439 --> 02:39:05.245
You're not getting too close to the tree.

02:39:05.245 --> 02:39:06.194
TRAVIS: Five.

02:39:06.194 --> 02:39:06.945
SAM: Nine.

02:39:06.945 --> 02:39:08.395
LIAM: 26.

02:39:08.395 --> 02:39:11.500
LAURA: 19. No, that's a-- yeah, 19.

02:39:11.500 --> 02:39:12.487
MARISHA: 14.

02:39:12.487 --> 02:39:13.602
TALIESIN: 23.

02:39:13.602 --> 02:39:17.604
MATT: As you guys are keeping on the outskirts of
the square, it's hard to make out the details, and

02:39:17.604 --> 02:39:24.948
the weathering has muddled the figures that are
hanging there. Percy and Vax, you guys notice the

02:39:24.948 --> 02:39:26.430
figure on the far left--

02:39:26.430 --> 02:39:29.019
LIAM: The body.

02:39:29.019 --> 02:39:38.600
MATT: The body on the far left has red paint
smattered across its face and its arms. It's

02:39:38.600 --> 02:39:46.881
wearing a dirtied, green, vest-like robe that
dangles below it as it hangs there, loosely.

02:39:46.881 --> 02:39:53.829
Immediately to the left of it you see what looks
to be the body of a child. The child is dressed up

02:39:53.829 --> 02:40:03.316
in a purplish, billowing shirt, very fine silk
shirt and pantaloons, and is dangling there next

02:40:03.316 --> 02:40:12.452
to it. To the left of that you see what appears to be a
female, adorned in greens and browns, looks like

02:40:12.532 --> 02:40:18.050
red paint has been driven through the hair, and
dangles to the left of that figure. Next to that,

02:40:18.050 --> 02:40:19.324
you see what appears to be--

02:40:19.324 --> 02:40:21.134
TALIESIN: I am walking the fuck away.

02:40:21.134 --> 02:40:26.724
MATT: -- you see what appears to be another woman,
dressed in dark blacks and browns, leathers, some

02:40:26.724 --> 02:40:32.362
furs across the top, dark hair, dangling. To the
left of that you see another man dressed

02:40:32.421 --> 02:40:38.723
similarly, dark greys and blacks, long dark hair,
dangling. To the left of that you see a rather

02:40:38.723 --> 02:40:45.226
large man, older, rotund, probably in his forties,
clothing padded but mostly open chest, hair

02:40:45.226 --> 02:40:51.810
completely shaven bald, it looks like there are
dark scars placed across the face, hanging. To the

02:40:51.810 --> 02:40:56.222
left of that you see, this figure is actually not
humanoid, you see what appears to have been--

02:40:56.222 --> 02:40:57.497
MARISHA: Oh my god.

02:40:57.497 --> 02:41:01.162
MATT: -- a recently hunted bear, who is dangling.

02:41:01.162 --> 02:41:03.947
MARISHA: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:41:03.947 --> 02:41:07.147
SAM: Wait, what? Is that us?

02:41:07.147 --> 02:41:09.985
MARISHA: It looks like us.

02:41:09.985 --> 02:41:11.837
TRAVIS: What?

02:41:11.837 --> 02:41:12.919
MARISHA: It's us!

02:41:12.919 --> 02:41:17.108
SAM: They killed people they thought were us, or
they killed--

02:41:17.108 --> 02:41:18.618
LIAM: Or it's a message.

02:41:18.618 --> 02:41:21.778
SAM: Or it's a message to us.

02:41:21.778 --> 02:41:28.358
MARISHA: Do they look like us or were they just
dressed like us? Are they made to look like us?

02:41:28.358 --> 02:41:29.993
MATT: Do you want to get closer and look?

02:41:29.993 --> 02:41:30.819
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:41:30.819 --> 02:41:32.287
TALIESIN: I'm a little curious--

02:41:32.287 --> 02:41:34.823
TRAVIS: Do you want to get closer and look? Are
you sure--

02:41:34.823 --> 02:41:36.771
TALIESIN: Is there anything around the tree other
than us?

02:41:36.771 --> 02:41:37.990
TRAVIS: They're probably watching the tree.

02:41:37.990 --> 02:41:40.665
TALIESIN: Is there something at the base of the
tree, is there anything?

02:41:40.665 --> 02:41:47.725
MATT: From what you can see now, nothing but just
rocks and stones and piles of loose cloth rotting

02:41:47.725 --> 02:41:55.664
below it. Approaching, it looks like each one of
these bodies has been dressed up. It looks like

02:41:55.664 --> 02:42:02.755
the color in the redhead's hair has been smeared
through with paint. It looks like the person who

02:42:02.755 --> 02:42:09.957
has been painted red has been slapdash. You gather
with a moment of looking at it that these were not

02:42:09.957 --> 02:42:15.265
individuals that were caught this way. This was
set up as a message.

02:42:15.265 --> 02:42:16.736
LAURA: (whispers) My god.

02:42:16.736 --> 02:42:18.061
SAM: Oh shit.

02:42:18.061 --> 02:42:19.182
LAURA: Keep walking, keep your head down and keep
walking.

02:42:19.182 --> 02:42:20.130
MARISHA: Oh, my god.

02:42:20.130 --> 02:42:21.103
TRAVIS: I don't think they're here.

02:42:21.103 --> 02:42:22.165
MARISHA: Oh, my god.

02:42:22.165 --> 02:42:23.495
TRAVIS: I don't think they're here.

02:42:23.495 --> 02:42:25.065
SAM: You mean in town? Of course they are!

02:42:25.065 --> 02:42:29.053
TRAVIS: No, remember they have to, like, be where
the soil they came from is?

02:42:29.053 --> 02:42:31.712
LAURA: No, they have, like hideouts, they don't
have to be where the soil they came from is.

02:42:31.712 --> 02:42:33.246
TRAVIS: I don't think they're here.

02:42:33.246 --> 02:42:34.212
SAM: Holy shit.

02:42:34.212 --> 02:42:36.653
LIAM: They're in their keep, buried deep.

02:42:36.653 --> 02:42:38.271
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:42:38.271 --> 02:42:47.603
MATT: You guys continue past, down this pathway.
There's other buildings you see in the vicinity

02:42:47.603 --> 02:42:54.867
that, you know, look abandoned or for the most
part unoccupied. I'd say about one in every three

02:42:54.867 --> 02:42:56.838
buildings looks like it's in disuse.

02:42:56.838 --> 02:43:01.232
LIAM: Did we see this big building right here as
we walked by? Yeah, that big one.

02:43:01.232 --> 02:43:04.138
MATT: You guys came-- made this path-- you can see
a little bit, you can see is a--

02:43:04.138 --> 02:43:05.449
TALIESIN: I should know what it is, anyway.

02:43:05.449 --> 02:43:08.481
MATT: -- iron fence, it used to belong to one of
the noble families of Whitestone. Each one of

02:43:08.481 --> 02:43:11.462
these large buildings here, these three, and you
remember this, were

02:43:11.462 --> 02:43:14.418
the three families that ran the town.

02:43:14.418 --> 02:43:16.672
TALIESIN: We can't go anywhere near those
buildings.

02:43:16.672 --> 02:43:19.760
We have to stay as far away as humanly possible.

02:43:19.760 --> 02:43:21.809
MARISHA: Question. You said there were eight
bodies?

02:43:21.809 --> 02:43:23.546
MATT: Eight bodies.

02:43:23.546 --> 02:43:28.407
MARISHA: Is there one that looks like a gnome
cleric and

02:43:28.407 --> 02:43:31.537
one that looks like a dragonborn sorcerer?

02:43:31.537 --> 02:43:32.662
LAURA: That was the first one.

02:43:32.662 --> 02:43:34.024
MATT and TRAVIS: The one's painted all red--

02:43:34.024 --> 02:43:35.417
LAURA: There wasn't a gnome cleric one there.

02:43:35.417 --> 02:43:38.432
MATT: No. There was a bear.

02:43:38.432 --> 02:43:45.997
LIAM: There was no cleric when we faced them
before. All of us who stood against them in Emon.

02:43:45.997 --> 02:43:47.190
TRAVIS: We're all there.

02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:51.311
SAM: Body of my guy. Is he sort of handsome?

02:43:51.311 --> 02:43:54.507
MARISHA: But, it does mean that it was because of
when they saw us in Emon--

02:43:54.507 --> 02:43:55.659
MATT: Think of an eight-year-old child.

02:43:55.659 --> 02:43:56.622
LAURA: It was a kid, yo.

02:43:56.622 --> 02:43:57.646
SAM: Oh, it was a child? Oh, god.

02:43:57.646 --> 02:43:59.598
MARISHA: -- because Tiberius wasn't here with the
crows.

02:43:59.598 --> 02:44:01.074
TRAVIS: No, it was because of Emon.

02:44:01.074 --> 02:44:02.461
MARISHA: It was because of Emon.

02:44:02.461 --> 02:44:03.292
LAURA: Yeah.

02:44:03.292 --> 02:44:08.454
MARISHA: So, can we get like a vague idea of how
long these people

02:44:08.454 --> 02:44:10.981
look like they might have been here?

02:44:10.981 --> 02:44:12.545
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:44:12.545 --> 02:44:14.801
MARISHA: (whispers) Fuck, I'm not good at this
shit.

02:44:14.801 --> 02:44:15.944
TALIESIN: Can I help?

02:44:15.944 --> 02:44:17.789
MATT: Sure. It would be advantage on that check
for you.

02:44:17.789 --> 02:44:20.874
MARISHA: Oh, that, you know, that wasn't bad.
Woo!

02:44:20.874 --> 02:44:22.162
TALIESIN: Oh! Never mind.

02:44:22.162 --> 02:44:23.643
MARISHA: I'll take that 19, 21?

02:44:23.643 --> 02:44:31.301
MATT: 21? You gather these bodies have probably
been here for the better part of a week, week and

02:44:31.301 --> 02:44:37.841
a half? There is some mild decomposition starting
to settle in, there is a bit of bloating to some

02:44:37.841 --> 02:44:41.301
of them. Couldn't have been much longer than
that.

02:44:41.301 --> 02:44:43.745
SAM: A week? That's before we set out.

02:44:43.745 --> 02:44:46.444
MARISHA: Why would they put a warning for us here
in the city?

02:44:46.444 --> 02:44:48.684
SAM: They assumed we would come, but they don't
know that we're here.

02:44:48.684 --> 02:44:50.290
TALIESIN: They invited us.

02:44:50.290 --> 02:44:53.348
LIAM: Those birds might have told them we were
here.

02:44:53.348 --> 02:44:55.803
SAM: This was a week ago, this was before we were
even close.

02:44:55.803 --> 02:44:57.237
TRAVIS: Let's stick with the plan.

02:44:57.237 --> 02:44:58.905
TALIESIN: Sticking with the plan.

02:44:58.905 --> 02:45:00.079
SAM: Let's go find a building.

02:45:00.079 --> 02:45:02.981
TALIESIN: Going to go find something that's a
decent distance away from the three noble

02:45:02.981 --> 02:45:06.623
households, that has a reasonable view of the
tree.

02:45:06.623 --> 02:45:08.368
TRAVIS: Yeah, 150 feet from the tree.

02:45:08.368 --> 02:45:10.040
MATT: That would probably be somewhere in this
vicinity here,

02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:11.884
as the three main houses are right there.

02:45:11.884 --> 02:45:15.802
TALIESIN: Something with a second-floor view, but
with some distance.

02:45:15.802 --> 02:45:18.111
TRAVIS: Preferably three bedroom, three bath.

02:45:18.111 --> 02:45:23.328
MATT: (laughs) I'd say make an investigation
check.

02:45:26.764 --> 02:45:28.266
TALIESIN: Meh. Six.

02:45:28.266 --> 02:45:31.591
LAURA: Can I look out too, I've been on the
lookout for a building the whole time!

02:45:31.591 --> 02:45:36.230
MATT: Yeah. I'll say, I'll say it takes the better
part of the next hour or so, and you do a little

02:45:36.230 --> 02:45:39.990
bit of meandering to find it, you guys are being
stealthy best you can through alleys and such, but

02:45:39.990 --> 02:45:44.669
even so you are out in the open, midday, but you
are also, you know, under Seeming.

02:45:44.669 --> 02:45:52.527
MARISHA: Does it look like there's a covering
nearby, roughly, 30 feet or so from the tree?

02:45:52.527 --> 02:45:54.110
LAURA: 30 feet?!

02:45:54.110 --> 02:45:55.247
SAM: 30 feet?

02:45:55.247 --> 02:45:56.038
MATT: No.

02:45:56.038 --> 02:45:57.042
SAM: What about 150?

02:45:57.042 --> 02:46:00.287
MATT: No, the tree is out in the center, and
essentially the nearest building is probably

02:46:00.287 --> 02:46:07.817
anywhere from 100, 200 feet away from it. It's the
tree out in the middle of the square, and the

02:46:07.817 --> 02:46:11.822
square, which used to have probably more things
towards the center, more temporary establishments,

02:46:11.822 --> 02:46:14.518
have all been put to the sides and put to disuse.

02:46:14.518 --> 02:46:17.722
SAM: Maybe underground stuff.

02:46:17.722 --> 02:46:22.601
MATT: You do manage to see what appear to be what
was once a tavern or an inn of some kind that is

02:46:22.601 --> 02:46:28.589
silent, closed, the doors locked and chained. The
windows look dusty.

02:46:28.589 --> 02:46:31.692
LAURA: Can we sneak in the windows, so it keeps
chained?

02:46:31.692 --> 02:46:34.879
MATT: Okay. You go around the side of it, to the
alley.

02:46:34.879 --> 02:46:36.406
TALIESIN: Dust of tracelessness.

02:46:36.406 --> 02:46:37.648
LAURA: Yeah, Dust of tracelessness.

02:46:37.648 --> 02:46:38.815
SAM: Are you guys going in?

02:46:38.815 --> 02:46:39.317
LIAM: Yeah.

02:46:39.317 --> 02:46:39.827
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:46:39.827 --> 02:46:40.373
LAURA: Yeah.

02:46:40.373 --> 02:46:41.401
TALIESIN: This is where we're going to hole up.

02:46:41.401 --> 02:46:42.460
MATT: Okay.

02:46:42.460 --> 02:46:43.652
MARISHA: I kind of want to talk to the tree.

02:46:43.652 --> 02:46:44.595
LAURA: Then go talk to the tree, Keyleth.

02:46:44.595 --> 02:46:45.277
MATT: The window is locked.

02:46:45.277 --> 02:46:46.109
SAM: Wait, not now. Not now.

02:46:46.109 --> 02:46:47.036
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no, no, not yet.

02:46:47.036 --> 02:46:47.835
SAM: Let's find a place first.

02:46:47.835 --> 02:46:48.697
TRAVIS: Let's post up first.

02:46:48.697 --> 02:46:50.989
LIAM: What am I, stealthing right now, or checking
for--

02:46:50.989 --> 02:46:52.875
MATT: Continuing your guys' stealth as your going,
this would be

02:46:52.875 --> 02:46:54.699
your attempting to unlock the window.

02:46:54.699 --> 02:46:56.626
LIAM: Oh, unlock, okay. So that's a 22.

02:46:56.626 --> 02:47:00.207
MATT: 22, okay. It takes a bit to jostle it in a
way, because the lock is on the inside, but there

02:47:00.288 --> 02:47:04.488
are ways that you could shimmy the glass and get
something underneath to push it aside. You manage

02:47:04.488 --> 02:47:10.066
to get the window open, and as you pull it up the
dust billows up around you, you set it aside. You

02:47:10.132 --> 02:47:20.361
step in and the place smells stale, musty. Dark.
There are, you can see, candlesticks set around

02:47:20.361 --> 02:47:25.046
that have not been lit for a while, and the oil
lanterns that normally light the interior of the

02:47:25.046 --> 02:47:30.117
main tavern social area have been long in disuse.

02:47:30.117 --> 02:47:32.394
LAURA: Is there a cellar here?

02:47:32.394 --> 02:47:35.082
MATT: If you guys want to look around. Are you all
going in?

02:47:35.082 --> 02:47:36.129
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're all going in.

02:47:36.129 --> 02:47:37.171
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're all going in.

02:47:37.171 --> 02:47:38.479
MATT: You as well? Or are you talking to the
tree?

02:47:38.479 --> 02:47:39.154
SAM: Yes.

02:47:39.154 --> 02:47:40.103
TRAVIS: Come inside.

02:47:40.103 --> 02:47:40.867
MARISHA: Does anyone want to come talk to a tree
with me?

02:47:40.867 --> 02:47:41.597
TALIESIN: Not yet.

02:47:41.597 --> 02:47:42.444
LAURA: Not yet, not just yet.

02:47:42.444 --> 02:47:43.280
TRAVIS: Don't bring that-- don't mess with that
thing.

02:47:43.280 --> 02:47:44.419
LIAM: Yeah, come with us. Keyleth, come with us.

02:47:44.419 --> 02:47:45.411
MARISHA: All right, all right.

02:47:45.411 --> 02:47:46.346
TRAVIS: Once we do it, it's like ringing a dinner
bell.

02:47:46.346 --> 02:47:48.753
MARISHA: All right, all right, all right, I'm
coming, I'm coming.

02:47:48.753 --> 02:47:50.561
SAM: I'm gonna look for a brothel!

02:47:50.561 --> 02:47:51.755
(all laugh)

02:47:51.755 --> 02:47:53.415
TALIESIN: That's going to be the saddest brothel.

02:47:53.415 --> 02:47:54.542
MARISHA: The saddest brothel!

02:47:54.542 --> 02:48:01.495
MATT: You find your way inside the abandoned
tavern. And it is what was this giant L-shaped

02:48:01.495 --> 02:48:07.942
building, right here in the corner of the town
square. There is a second floor, approximately

02:48:07.942 --> 02:48:16.057
runs 20 rooms. They are all currently unlocked,
some of them left open, the bedding covered in

02:48:16.057 --> 02:48:18.430
dust, some of it looks like it was left in a
hurry.

02:48:18.430 --> 02:48:20.443
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll take it.

02:48:20.443 --> 02:48:22.427
MATT: There is a cellar.

02:48:22.427 --> 02:48:23.543
LAURA: Yeah.

02:48:23.543 --> 02:48:30.298
MATT: You find the cellar, and down there, there
are a number of empty barrels, and a couple of

02:48:30.298 --> 02:48:31.805
ones that are still full.

02:48:31.805 --> 02:48:32.725
SAM: Ooh!

02:48:32.725 --> 02:48:37.353
MATT: One that appears to be a heavy whiskey
barrel, probably about twenty untouched wine

02:48:37.353 --> 02:48:45.314
bottles. A little bit of ale, but it looks like a
lot of ale was either completely used, or taken

02:48:45.314 --> 02:48:47.802
with whoever left and abandoned the premises.

02:48:47.802 --> 02:48:50.140
LAURA: I think we can definitely use these for
explosions, if we need them.

02:48:50.140 --> 02:48:51.234
MARISHA: Ooh!

02:48:51.234 --> 02:48:53.047
SAM: Or to drink.

02:48:53.047 --> 02:48:56.865
TALIESIN: Muscle relaxers. Is there a view of the
tree?

02:48:56.865 --> 02:49:03.171
MATT: Going from a number of the rooms up top, not
every room has a window, but it's like every third

02:49:03.171 --> 02:49:10.684
room on that side of the building does have a view
of the entire square.

02:49:10.684 --> 02:49:13.937
MARISHA: Can I get an eye as to how far away it
is?

02:49:13.937 --> 02:49:20.845
MATT: I'd say probably about 200 feet? 250 feet?

02:49:20.845 --> 02:49:23.750
LAURA: Can you go invisible and still talk to the
tree?

02:49:23.750 --> 02:49:24.728
MARISHA: Hmm?

02:49:24.728 --> 02:49:25.990
SAM: I can make her invisible if she can talk to
the tree.

02:49:25.990 --> 02:49:27.424
LAURA: Can you talk to the tree if you're
invisible?

02:49:27.424 --> 02:49:29.644
MATT: If you cast a spell while invisible, unless
it's Greater Invisibility,

02:49:29.644 --> 02:49:31.629
then it will drop the illusion.

02:49:31.629 --> 02:49:32.877
SAM: I can make her invisible.

02:49:32.877 --> 02:49:34.182
MARISHA: I got an idea.

02:49:34.182 --> 02:49:35.544
SAM: We can burrow under, we can--

02:49:35.544 --> 02:49:36.381
LAURA: Yeah.

02:49:36.381 --> 02:49:39.606
SAM: -- find something closer.

02:49:39.606 --> 02:49:42.945
MARISHA: Actually, what are we up to right now?
Are we doing anything? Are we busy?

02:49:42.945 --> 02:49:46.100
SAM: Well, there are windows on the first floor,
right?

02:49:46.100 --> 02:49:48.180
MATT: There are some windows in the tavern; there
was one on the second floor.

02:49:48.180 --> 02:49:50.304
LAURA: We're in the cellar, that's why I went to
the cellar.

02:49:50.304 --> 02:49:51.493
MARISHA: Oh, there's a cellar?

02:49:51.493 --> 02:49:54.671
SAM: I'm gonna just find some old rags, or
anything I can find, tablecloths,

02:49:54.671 --> 02:49:58.437
and just cover the windows.

02:49:58.437 --> 02:50:01.762
LAURA: But make it not obvious, because it doesn't
want to look like we covered the windows.

02:50:01.762 --> 02:50:03.165
SAM: True.

02:50:03.165 --> 02:50:08.627
LIAM: I've watched you pass through solid stone
and earth. How long can you do that for?

02:50:08.627 --> 02:50:12.783
MARISHA: I mean, I can burrow us a tunnel right
now.

02:50:12.783 --> 02:50:13.708
LAURA: Do it!

02:50:13.708 --> 02:50:16.011
LIAM: Can you get us close to underneath the
tree?

02:50:16.011 --> 02:50:17.540
LAURA: That's what she's going to do.

02:50:17.540 --> 02:50:20.769
MARISHA: I'm going to do it right now. I'm going
to cast Move Earth.

02:50:20.769 --> 02:50:22.167
LAURA: From the cellar.

02:50:22.167 --> 02:50:25.184
MATT: You're going to start carving a tunnel--

02:50:25.184 --> 02:50:31.049
MARISHA: To the direction of the tree. And I want
to be careful, I don't want to damage the roots of

02:50:31.049 --> 02:50:35.070
the tree at all. So, as I start getting closer, I want
to start looking for the roots of the tree.

02:50:35.145 --> 02:50:43.455
MATT: Okay. Easy enough to find old rags; all of
them have that stale, musty towel scent to them.

02:50:43.530 --> 02:50:48.526
You get them a little wet. There's no water here;
all the water here has dried out.

02:50:48.526 --> 02:50:49.802
SAM: We use the wine.

02:50:49.802 --> 02:50:52.362
MATT: You'll have to use the wine; it'll probably
kill some of the bacteria. There are wells

02:50:52.362 --> 02:50:56.299
throughout the towns you see, ground wells that
are set in the city. There is no nearby river. The

02:50:56.299 --> 02:50:59.607
closest river, the one you know about, is about a
30 minute walk south.

02:50:59.607 --> 02:51:00.834
TALIESIN: It's a bit of a ways.

02:51:00.834 --> 02:51:06.800
MATT: Yeah. You use that to coax them out a bit.
It's easy enough for you to go around and put

02:51:06.800 --> 02:51:11.050
cloth over the windows. It's a dark interior, so
it's not like an immediate--

02:51:11.050 --> 02:51:13.250
TALIESIN: Just so light doesn't leak out.

02:51:13.250 --> 02:51:22.091
LIAM: But, just in case, I think I'll hang back.
I'm not going down to the pre-made tunnel, I'll

02:51:22.091 --> 02:51:24.072
just keep an eye above ground.

02:51:24.072 --> 02:51:25.670
TRAVIS: I am, too, I'm staying up in the tavern.

02:51:25.670 --> 02:51:27.094
LAURA: I'm going with you to the tunnel.

02:51:27.094 --> 02:51:30.077
TALIESIN: I'm going to tinker a little thing. Can
I borrow an arrow?

02:51:30.077 --> 02:51:31.130
LAURA: Yes.

02:51:31.130 --> 02:51:34.220
TALIESIN: Thank you. I'm going to tinker a very
little, easy thing.

02:51:34.220 --> 02:51:35.923
TRAVIS: You want the top floor, I'll take the
bottom floor.

02:51:35.923 --> 02:51:45.965
TALIESIN: I want to be able to fire and ignite one
of the parchments on an arrow. So that I can--

02:51:45.965 --> 02:51:48.180
LAURA: Do you want me to shoot the arrow for you?

02:51:48.180 --> 02:51:52.664
TALIESIN: -- set a burn mark at a distance.

02:51:53.570 --> 02:51:55.368
MATT: Interesting. Okay.

02:51:55.368 --> 02:52:01.991
TALIESIN: It would be a spark, as opposed to
actual flame. It would just be concussive force.

02:52:01.991 --> 02:52:05.701
MATT: Right, it's more getting the parchment there
without it tearing or the arrow leaving it behind,

02:52:05.701 --> 02:52:07.484
because it is a thin, flimsy piece.

02:52:07.484 --> 02:52:09.298
TALIESIN: It would be coiled.

02:52:09.298 --> 02:52:11.015
MATT: Coiled and then--

02:52:11.015 --> 02:52:13.033
TALIESIN: Hit, release.

02:52:13.033 --> 02:52:18.118
MATT: That's going to be a really intricate-- go
ahead and roll a tinkerer's check.

02:52:18.118 --> 02:52:20.601
LIAM: 20, 20, 20.

02:52:21.883 --> 02:52:23.661
TALIESIN: 16.

02:52:23.661 --> 02:52:29.414
MATT: Okay. You toy with it for a while; you think
you have something that may work. You're uncertain

02:52:29.414 --> 02:52:35.150
as to on its release if it'll function or not. So,
write down 'Parchment Delivery Arrow' with a

02:52:35.150 --> 02:52:37.528
question mark next to it.

02:52:37.528 --> 02:52:38.911
SAM: Maybe there's a simpler way.

02:52:38.911 --> 02:52:41.248
TALIESIN: There might be, but just in case there's
not, I want to make sure this works.

02:52:41.248 --> 02:52:44.637
MARISHA: You could always slap it up there 
and shoot it with a flame arrow.

02:52:44.698 --> 02:52:48.849
TALIESIN: I've got three of them, so I've got
options. But I just want to make sure--

02:52:48.849 --> 02:52:51.960
MARISHA: How's my burrowing going? 200 feet.

02:52:51.960 --> 02:53:00.292
MATT: All right. You continue to burrow through
the ground, moving the earth aside and the tunnel

02:53:00.292 --> 02:53:07.763
opens before you like the clay slowly melting
away. And it is wet earth. Eventually, you start

02:53:07.825 --> 02:53:13.313
getting to a few thick roots under the tree.

02:53:13.313 --> 02:53:15.525
LAURA: Can you talk to it from here, Keyleth?

02:53:15.525 --> 02:53:20.269
MATT: The roots that you see, they continue past
the tunnel. They go very,

02:53:20.269 --> 02:53:22.585
very deep into the ground.

02:53:22.585 --> 02:53:28.331
MARISHA: Awesome. I'm going to clear out a little
more area, and I'm going to touch the roots and

02:53:28.331 --> 02:53:30.658
cast Speak with Plants.

02:53:30.658 --> 02:53:32.833
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

02:53:32.833 --> 02:53:34.026
SAM: Speak with Plants?

02:53:34.026 --> 02:53:35.249
LIAM: Haroom haroom.

02:53:35.249 --> 02:53:36.518
TALIESIN: The only superpower more pathetic than
Aquaman's.

02:53:36.518 --> 02:53:37.646
LAURA: Yeah.

02:53:37.646 --> 02:53:38.427
MARISHA: Shut up.

02:53:38.427 --> 02:53:39.212
TALIESIN: Sorry, had to.

02:53:39.212 --> 02:53:41.104
LAURA: (kid's voice) Gee wiz, I wish I had some
water.

02:53:41.104 --> 02:53:44.452
MARISHA: (kid's voice) The sun is so bright
today!

02:53:44.452 --> 02:53:47.710
LAURA: Too bad we don't have Tiberius with us with
his endless water fucking pitcher.

02:53:47.710 --> 02:53:50.526
LIAM: It's Ent voice. Haroom haroom!

02:53:50.526 --> 02:53:50.776
TALIESIN: Hi, Aquaman.

02:53:50.776 --> 02:53:52.015
LAURA: Sure, sure, sure.

02:53:52.015 --> 02:53:52.900
TALIESIN: Hi, Aquaman.

02:53:52.900 --> 02:53:54.776
SAM: I can go to one of the wells and get some
water.

02:53:54.776 --> 02:53:55.584
TALIESIN: Hi, Aquaman.

02:53:55.584 --> 02:53:56.332
MARISHA: Hey, he's cool sometimes.

02:53:56.332 --> 02:53:57.112
TALIESIN: Hi, Aquaman.

02:53:57.112 --> 02:53:57.873
MARISHA: Sometimes.

02:53:57.873 --> 02:53:59.152
TALIESIN: It's what fish say. Hi, Aquaman.

02:53:59.152 --> 02:54:00.761
MARISHA: That's what fish say.

02:54:00.761 --> 02:54:03.267
LIAM: That's all they say.

02:54:03.267 --> 02:54:04.514
TALIESIN: Hi, Aquaman.

02:54:04.514 --> 02:54:10.831
MATT: You finish the spell and you reach out and
you touch the root and you instill the force of

02:54:10.831 --> 02:54:19.202
your nature-based divine energies into the root.
Silence.

02:54:19.202 --> 02:54:21.572
SAM: Oh no.

02:54:21.572 --> 02:54:22.827
MATT: This tree is dead.

02:54:22.827 --> 02:54:23.583
TRAVIS: No!

02:54:23.583 --> 02:54:24.970
SAM: Dead?!

02:54:24.970 --> 02:54:26.327
LAURA: You can bring it back!

02:54:26.327 --> 02:54:28.164
MARISHA: I can bring it back. Should I?

02:54:28.164 --> 02:54:30.265
SAM: You can do that?

02:54:30.265 --> 02:54:32.781
MARISHA: I'm a druid, that's my-- yeah man!

02:54:32.781 --> 02:54:35.235
SAM: You can bring dead things back?

02:54:35.235 --> 02:54:37.209
MARISHA: Yeah, it's called Plant Growth!

02:54:37.209 --> 02:54:37.920
SAM: What?!

02:54:37.920 --> 02:54:38.635
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:54:38.635 --> 02:54:39.632
SAM: This I gotta see.

02:54:39.632 --> 02:54:43.249
MARISHA: Should I? Okay. But it's dead. What time
is it now?

02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:48.699
MATT: Right now, with all the traveling you guys
have done, I'd say it's past noon, probably.

02:54:48.699 --> 02:54:52.615
Including the time you've spent inside the tavern,
searching it through and preparing it

02:54:52.615 --> 02:54:55.084
as your base of operations.

02:54:55.084 --> 02:54:55.857
LAURA: Try it.

02:54:55.857 --> 02:54:56.843
MARISHA: Should I start it up now?

02:54:56.843 --> 02:54:57.478
SAM: Yeah!

02:54:57.478 --> 02:54:58.674
LIAM, LAURA, and TRAVIS: Go for it!

02:54:58.674 --> 02:55:04.062
MARISHA: I'm going to start my Plant Growth. I'm
going to drop. Can I try to clear out an area

02:55:04.062 --> 02:55:07.562
where I can-- I should be fine.

02:55:07.562 --> 02:55:09.016
LAURA: Reach up in its junk.

02:55:09.016 --> 02:55:10.976
TALIESIN: Put your hand in it.

02:55:10.976 --> 02:55:14.228
MARISHA: I'm going to strap on my gloves.

02:55:14.228 --> 02:55:15.770
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:55:15.770 --> 02:55:19.697
LIAM: Turn and cough.

02:55:19.697 --> 02:55:23.186
MARISHA: Hope you guys are ready for this.

02:55:23.186 --> 02:55:24.265
SAM: Is it going to be loud?

02:55:24.265 --> 02:55:25.688
MARISHA: No, it's just going to take a long time.

02:55:25.688 --> 02:55:27.682
TRAVIS: Vax and I are guarding the tavern, so if
anything comes--

02:55:27.682 --> 02:55:30.624
SAM: I'm going to get provisions ready to
spoon-feed her.

02:55:30.624 --> 02:55:34.709
MARISHA: Actually, before I do that, can we all
have one last meal together

02:55:34.709 --> 02:55:36.925
and eat a Heroes' Feast?

02:55:36.925 --> 02:55:37.838
LAURA: I like it.

02:55:37.838 --> 02:55:38.798
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:55:38.798 --> 02:55:39.693
MATT: Certainly.

02:55:39.693 --> 02:55:41.080
TALIESIN: Let's eat.

02:55:41.080 --> 02:55:46.637
MATT: So, you've made the purchase within Emon for
how many of the

02:55:46.637 --> 02:55:50.598
requisite chalice for the Heroes' Feast?

02:55:50.738 --> 02:55:53.107
MARISHA: How many did I buy?

02:55:53.107 --> 02:55:55.461
TALIESIN: You have at least one.

02:55:55.461 --> 02:56:00.996
MARISHA: It gets used. It's expensive.

02:56:00.996 --> 02:56:02.315
LAURA: It's $1000.

02:56:02.315 --> 02:56:03.235
MARISHA: It's $1000.

02:56:03.235 --> 02:56:08.030
MATT: It's a gem-encrusted bowl worth 1000 gold
pieces, which the spell consumes. So, we'll say

02:56:08.030 --> 02:56:12.643
how many of those did you purchase in Emon,
knowing you'd be casting this in the future?

02:56:13.136 --> 02:56:15.451
MARISHA: How much gold do we have?

02:56:15.451 --> 02:56:16.915
SAM: Not a lot.

02:56:16.915 --> 02:56:22.134
LAURA: Is that for each person, or 1000 gold for
the whole party?

02:56:22.134 --> 02:56:23.531
MATT: For the whole feast.

02:56:23.531 --> 02:56:25.848
LAURA: How about you did three bowls?

02:56:25.848 --> 02:56:27.158
MARISHA: Three bowls.

02:56:27.158 --> 02:56:34.664
MATT: Mark 3000 gold from the group's queue. And
you have three gem bowls, using one now. So you

02:56:34.664 --> 02:56:40.418
have two bowls left at your disposal. And you
prepare a Heroes' Feast for the group to consume.

02:56:40.479 --> 02:56:44.502
MARISHA: I take some of that leftover wine, use
that to make it fancy wine.

02:56:44.502 --> 02:56:46.216
SAM: This is great. This is awesome.

02:56:46.216 --> 02:56:48.842
LAURA: Are we eating in the cellar?

02:56:48.842 --> 02:56:53.236
MARISHA: So you get, I believe, 2d12 additional hit
points on top of your maximum hit points.

02:56:53.299 --> 02:56:54.543
SAM: Wait, forever?

02:56:54.543 --> 02:56:56.037
LAURA: No, no, for how long?

02:56:56.037 --> 02:56:57.054
MARISHA: For 24 hours.

02:56:57.054 --> 02:56:58.267
MATT: It lasts for 24 hours.

02:56:58.267 --> 02:56:59.248
SAM: 2d12?

02:56:59.248 --> 02:57:00.568
MATT: So, until about--

02:57:00.568 --> 02:57:02.726
SAM: What the fuck is a d12? I've never rolled a
d12.

02:57:02.726 --> 02:57:07.574
MATT: -- 2PM tomorrow. So mark that down, somebody
note that it lasts until 2PM.

02:57:07.582 --> 02:57:09.973
LAURA: An additional 2d12?

02:57:09.973 --> 02:57:11.518
MATT: 2d10?

02:57:11.518 --> 02:57:12.733
MARISHA: Oh, I'm sorry, 2d10.

02:57:12.733 --> 02:57:13.731
TALIESIN: Damn it.

02:57:13.731 --> 02:57:16.917
LAURA: Overall hit points.

02:57:16.917 --> 02:57:22.989
MARISHA: And, you should have- Ooh! I got two
tens!

02:57:23.049 --> 02:57:24.988
LAURA: Ah, badass!

02:57:24.988 --> 02:57:26.483
MATT: Trinket can also benefit from this, by the
way, too.

02:57:26.483 --> 02:57:29.883
LAURA: Yay! Nice.

02:57:29.940 --> 02:57:31.445
TALIESIN: You also get other bonuses.

02:57:31.445 --> 02:57:35.077
MATT: Yep. You are immune to poison, and diseases,
and being frightened, and all wisdom saving throws

02:57:35.077 --> 02:57:38.140
are made with advantage. Feast is awesome.

02:57:38.140 --> 02:57:40.198
SAM: Why don't we do that right before we go see
the Briarwoods, also?

02:57:40.198 --> 02:57:41.234
LAURA: We have another bowl.

02:57:41.234 --> 02:57:43.072
MARISHA: We have two more bowls.

02:57:43.072 --> 02:57:44.268
SAM: Because that is fucking awesome.

02:57:44.268 --> 02:57:47.918
MARISHA: Doing that right now, just in case the
Briarwoods decide to come say hello.

02:57:47.918 --> 02:57:51.940
TALIESIN: Or any of the other terrible people who
live in this town because there are terrible

02:57:51.940 --> 02:57:53.594
people in this town.

02:57:53.594 --> 02:57:55.317
TRAVIS: That was a delicious feast.

02:57:55.317 --> 02:57:58.573
SAM: The tikka masala was tangy!

02:57:58.573 --> 02:58:02.672
MARISHA: So, we're immune to poison--

02:58:02.672 --> 02:58:16.085
MATT: And disease and frightened. So, feast
consumed, you now take your next eight hours--

02:58:16.085 --> 02:58:18.820
MARISHA: I'm going to go meditate. I'll be back in
eight hours.

02:58:18.820 --> 02:58:23.627
MATT: --to work on this. As she sits down to begin
the ritual of cleansing, or bringing plant

02:58:23.627 --> 02:58:30.316
vitality enhancement to the vicinity of
Whitestone. We're going to go ahead and end

02:58:30.316 --> 02:58:37.034
today's session there. Pick up at the end of that
spell at the beginning of next week.

02:58:37.100 --> 02:58:43.442
TALIESIN: I love you all so much. I love you so much.

02:58:43.442 --> 02:58:44.473
MATT: This is getting real interesting.

02:58:44.473 --> 02:58:45.539
MARISHA: What time is it?

02:58:45.539 --> 02:58:49.296
LIAM: It was like eight in the morning-ish when we 
found that building, yeah?

02:58:49.296 --> 02:58:50.232
MATT: What?

02:58:50.232 --> 02:58:52.801
LIAM: Was it around eight in the morning when we
got to that house?

02:58:52.801 --> 02:58:54.616
MATT: You guys got to town around nine, 9:30.

02:58:54.616 --> 02:58:57.763
LAURA: So the spell probably started around 11.

02:58:57.763 --> 02:59:02.075
MATT: Walking around, seeing things, finding the 
tavern. And then getting in there and cleaning it out.

02:59:02.075 --> 02:59:08.249
I'd say you're getting close to one, two o'clock now. 
You've also taken it slow, you're also being stealthy

02:59:08.249 --> 02:59:09.947
and not trying to be conspicuous as you move 
through.

02:59:09.947 --> 02:59:12.472
LAURA: Right, so we'll start the fight in the morning
the next day.

02:59:12.472 --> 02:59:15.702
MARISHA: Well, I'm meditating now. I dropped into 
my meditation--

02:59:15.702 --> 02:59:18.543
SAM: We're not starting any fight, we're forming
an insurgency.

02:59:18.543 --> 02:59:22.020
MARISHA: Hopefully nothing happens and y'all don't
have to defend me while I'm doing this shit.

02:59:22.020 --> 02:59:25.328
That's what I'm hoping for.

02:59:25.936 --> 02:59:30.024
TALIESIN: I have stuff to give you, too, 'cause, yeah.

02:59:30.954 --> 02:59:31.523
SAM: Wow.

02:59:31.533 --> 02:59:32.700
LAURA: Man.

02:59:32.700 --> 02:59:34.684
TALIESIN: Thank you for letting me roll with that,
by the way.

02:59:34.765 --> 02:59:35.933
MATT: Of course. It fit right into my--

02:59:35.933 --> 02:59:38.323
TALIESIN: I had a funny feeling it would.

02:59:38.323 --> 02:59:41.985
MATT: All right, guys. So we'll pick up from there
next week, right in the center of the--

02:59:41.985 --> 02:59:45.946
MARISHA: A tree full of dead us? That's fucked up.

02:59:45.946 --> 02:59:46.763
LAURA: That's mean, Matt.

02:59:46.763 --> 02:59:48.269
TALIESIN: That was some mean shit, man.

02:59:48.269 --> 02:59:49.798
LIAM: That's what you call a giving tree.

02:59:49.798 --> 02:59:53.426
MATT: It's a friendly place, Whitestone.

02:59:53.426 --> 02:59:55.849
SAM: And the tree was happy. But not really.

02:59:55.849 --> 03:00:00.812
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, so that was it.

03:00:00.812 --> 03:00:06.112
MATT: All righty. Well, I guess we have the 
announcements.

03:00:06.112 --> 03:00:07.820
ZAC: We have some donations.

03:00:07.820 --> 03:00:09.982
MATT: Yeah, you guys are awesome.

03:00:09.982 --> 03:00:14.776
ZAC: And I wanna thank the chatroom for being
on their best behavior tonight.

03:00:14.776 --> 03:00:17.076
LAURA: Thanks, guys.

03:00:17.076 --> 03:00:18.692
ZAC: Avoided the banhammer.

03:00:18.692 --> 03:00:19.817
SAM: The what?

03:00:19.817 --> 03:00:21.447
ZAC: They avoided the banhammer.

03:00:21.447 --> 03:00:22.319
TALIESIN: There was no banhammer?

03:00:22.319 --> 03:00:26.953
ZAC: Not by me, anyway. There's always a couple
trolls that find their way.

03:00:26.953 --> 03:00:32.648
MATT: Yeah, it's the internet. Trolls happen. But 
yeah, guys, thank you for being respectful.

03:00:32.648 --> 03:00:35.963
TALIESIN: Guys, thank you, oh my god, I'm so happy

you're all continuously fantastic in your support

03:05:35.176 --> 03:05:40.226
for this community, for the charity causes that we
put this out for, ever-humbled.

03:05:40.226 --> 03:05:46.091
ZAC: Another big charity cause tomorrow. Where
you're on drums. So tomorrow the Battle of the Bands

03:05:46.091 --> 03:05:54.703
from 5-7PM. Your team, in case you don't know, is
you, Felicia Day, Tom Lenk, and Josephine, one of our mods.

03:05:54.703 --> 03:05:59.714
See, Felicia was doing this thing where she was like,
what team could I put together that will immediately

03:05:59.714 --> 03:06:07.042
win fan-favorite without doing any actual work?
So we saw your plan, Felicia, and we came back with

03:06:07.042 --> 03:06:11.540
our team of Lucas, Mr. Spoopy in the back, running the
tech board.

03:06:11.540 --> 03:06:13.291
MATT: Heck yeah.

03:06:13.291 --> 03:06:20.576
ZAC: Augie, who is a professional drummer, Hector, and
Amy Dallen, and we know, between Amy and Josephine,

03:06:20.576 --> 03:06:24.489
our chat room is definitely going to be split on who's
the chat room favorite, so.

03:06:24.556 --> 03:06:26.382
MATT: So is the professional drummer on bass?

03:06:26.382 --> 03:06:28.441

03:06:28.441 --> 03:06:29.685
TALIESIN: You dropped Whitestone.

03:06:29.685 --> 03:06:35.432
ZAC: He is not on bass. Lucas is able to play all songs
on Expert on guitar, I think you guys are gonna

03:06:35.432 --> 03:06:38.026
have your work cut out for you. For sure.

03:06:38.026 --> 03:06:39.699
MATT: It's all good.

03:06:39.699 --> 03:06:45.209
ZAC: For sure. They also work here almost all
week, and practice after all the shows. (laughs)

03:06:45.209 --> 03:06:46.301
MATT: That's cool.

03:06:46.301 --> 03:06:47.413
TALESIN: Is that what you do?

03:06:47.413 --> 03:06:50.620
MATT: I prefer to light my opponents on fire while
they're drumming, 'cause I find that's a

03:06:50.807 --> 03:06:51.982
good challenge for their skillset.

03:06:51.982 --> 03:06:57.742
ZAC: Oh, that would make sure a good show. I'm very
okay with it. Like, let's go for it.

03:06:57.742 --> 03:06:59.289
It's for charity, let's just do it.

03:06:59.289 --> 03:07:00.694
MATT: All righty.

03:07:00.694 --> 03:07:05.446
TALIESIN: I wanna say, we had a studio audience for this
show as well, which we're very thankful for.

03:07:05.446 --> 03:07:07.123
MATT: Yes we did, actually.

03:07:07.123 --> 03:07:08.795
MARISHA: Fellow critter! Alec!

03:07:08.795 --> 03:07:10.754
ZAC: Come on up real fast. Yeah.

03:07:10.754 --> 03:07:12.146
MARISHA: Go next to the DM!

03:07:12.146 --> 03:07:15.653
MATT: Come here real fast!

03:07:15.653 --> 03:07:19.096
TRAVIS: Duck down low!

03:07:19.096 --> 03:07:20.531
MATT: Come on down here and say hello.

03:07:20.531 --> 03:07:24.933
ALEC: What's up, Twitch chat? How you doing?
These guys are exactly as awesome as you

03:07:24.933 --> 03:07:31.225
imagine them to be. I have to say, completely
blown away. Absolutely blown away.

03:07:31.225 --> 03:07:32.540
LAURA: Oh, you.

03:07:32.540 --> 03:07:35.315
TALIESIN: Thanks for just stopping by.
That was cool.

03:07:35.315 --> 03:07:36.792
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah.

03:07:36.792 --> 03:07:39.070
MATT: Seriously, man. Thank you so much.

03:07:39.070 --> 03:07:40.156
ALEC: Thanks for having me.

03:07:40.156 --> 03:07:42.054
MATT: Of course, buddy. And guys, thank you
all so much for tuning in. Hope you enjoyed

03:07:42.054 --> 03:07:47.333
it. We'll be back next week, Thursday. I guess we'll
end here with a

03:07:47.333 --> 03:07:51.211
is it Thursday yet? Have a good night, guys.
