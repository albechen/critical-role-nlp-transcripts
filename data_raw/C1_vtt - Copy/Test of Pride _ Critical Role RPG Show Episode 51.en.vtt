00:00:00.988 --> 00:00:03.127
Due to apparently a fried
motherboard suddenly,

00:00:03.127 --> 00:00:05.129
we're not gonna be able to--

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:06.097
we're gonna have to be
switching cameras tonight

00:00:06.097 --> 00:00:06.930
so bear with us.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.147
It's gonna be a lot of one shots.

00:00:08.147 --> 00:00:11.268
Single shots cutting back and forth.

00:00:11.268 --> 00:00:13.196
But it'll still be a great episode.

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:14.615
Hope you enjoy.

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:15.691
Let's go ahead and get to

00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:16.695
these announcements real fast.

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:17.616
Those who haven't seen it,

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:20.129
Dragon+ Magazine put up
today a new issue in which

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:21.913
they interviewed me and a bunch of other

00:00:21.913 --> 00:00:23.551
great DM's that stream

00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:27.199
for West Marches and Real Roleplay

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.249
and Highrollers and Chris Perkins himself.

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:31.984
So go check that out, the new

00:00:31.984 --> 00:00:34.064
issue of Dragon+ if you get the chance and

00:00:34.064 --> 00:00:37.426
maybe find some wisdom in there.

00:00:37.426 --> 00:00:39.231
Also we just released recently, if--

00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:41.113
unless you guys are releasing it now,

00:00:41.113 --> 00:00:43.332
a new cell phone wallpaper,

00:00:43.332 --> 00:00:45.573
featuring some of the amazing photography

00:00:45.573 --> 00:00:49.202
of our recent group's
photo shoot in costume.

00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:52.055
So that I think is up
on the social media now.

00:00:52.055 --> 00:00:52.888
Is that right?

00:00:52.888 --> 00:00:53.721
Mhm.

00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:55.012
Go find it.

00:00:55.012 --> 00:00:57.181
It is somewhere on the internet.

00:00:57.181 --> 00:00:59.621
LAURA: It's up on
Twitter and on Facebook.

00:00:59.621 --> 00:01:00.454
There you go.

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:03.880
Twitter and Facebook, go find it.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.974
Next up...

00:01:04.974 --> 00:01:07.377
a really amazing game called Mascarada

00:01:07.377 --> 00:01:08.551
that I'm lucky to be a part of.

00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:10.284
It's on Kickstarter to
finish up their big push

00:01:10.284 --> 00:01:13.718
for the final polish of the game.

00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:15.512
If you're looking for a
great kind of isometric,

00:01:15.512 --> 00:01:17.187
beautifully drawn RPG experience,

00:01:17.187 --> 00:01:18.593
go check out the Kickstarter and if it's

00:01:18.593 --> 00:01:19.954
something you wanna help make

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:22.036
the best it can possibly be, do so,

00:01:22.036 --> 00:01:24.442
so go check out Mascarada on Kickstarter.

00:01:24.442 --> 00:01:27.760
Also, this week, or as of last Friday,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.884
the Goblin one-shot that we
did with Marisha and Taliesin

00:01:30.884 --> 00:01:32.026
and a bunch of other fantastic guests

00:01:32.026 --> 00:01:33.508
is up on the Geek and Sundry website

00:01:33.508 --> 00:01:34.548
if you haven't seen it yet.

00:01:34.548 --> 00:01:37.282
It's ridiculous and I
think you'll enjoy it.

00:01:37.282 --> 00:01:38.282
And...

00:01:38.282 --> 00:01:41.295
Also, as a reminder, that the

00:01:41.295 --> 00:01:43.271
"How do you want to do this?" sweaters

00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:45.613
are still up for pre-order in the store.

00:01:45.613 --> 00:01:47.188
Oh wait, but it has to switch.

00:01:47.188 --> 00:01:48.021
SAM: No, it switches.

00:01:48.021 --> 00:01:48.923
It switches?

00:01:48.923 --> 00:01:49.970
SAM: They can switch cameras.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:50.803
Oh.

00:01:50.803 --> 00:01:51.636
SAM: Just one at a time.

00:01:51.636 --> 00:01:52.634
Wait, wait.

00:01:52.634 --> 00:01:54.519
And, we finally have the

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:55.740
"How do you want to do this?" T-shirts

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.134
back in stock in the shop.

00:01:58.134 --> 00:02:01.249
So those who missed that,
we finally, finally got them

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:02.552
back up in stock on the website,

00:02:02.552 --> 00:02:04.335
so if you're looking for
those, they're available.

00:02:04.335 --> 00:02:06.541
LAURA: They're for
pre-order for another week.

00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:08.475
There's like modeling happening right now.

00:02:08.475 --> 00:02:09.613
And then, I know there was modeling.

00:02:09.613 --> 00:02:12.553
These European models are
in these smoking hot--

00:02:12.553 --> 00:02:14.913
Oh, who? These European models?

00:02:14.913 --> 00:02:16.666
MATT: Look, they see
something fascinating far away

00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:17.697
and they're turning to see it.

00:02:17.697 --> 00:02:19.114
Oh, look at that.

00:02:19.352 --> 00:02:23.862
[audio silence]

00:02:24.454 --> 00:02:25.287
Liam?

00:02:25.287 --> 00:02:26.120
What?

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.873
Oh man I hope in the last
hour, I hope in the last hour,

00:02:27.873 --> 00:02:30.274
where you had all this time to kill,

00:02:30.274 --> 00:02:34.186
you went to Wyrmwood Gaming
to get boxes for your dice

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:36.322
where you could use the code Critrole.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:37.389
Critrole!

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:38.959
To get free shipping.

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.470
Not free boxes, but free
shipping with Critrole.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.680
Also, I think we got one more week

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.857
on their Kickstarter for the sentinel box,

00:02:45.857 --> 00:02:48.994
you can get this logo on any box, but--

00:02:48.994 --> 00:02:49.827
Right here.

00:02:49.827 --> 00:02:51.874
You could also get the Vox Machina box

00:02:51.874 --> 00:02:53.350
which is pretty sweet.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.229
Inlaid and fancy.

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:56.062
If you're nuts.

00:02:56.062 --> 00:02:57.524
I keep a human heart in here.

00:02:57.524 --> 00:02:58.357
It's true.

00:02:58.357 --> 00:02:59.190
Critrole.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.673
(laughing)

00:03:01.673 --> 00:03:02.506
All right.

00:03:02.506 --> 00:03:03.339
Anything else, are we good to jump

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:05.321
into this game for tonight?

00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:06.154
TRAVIS: Light this candle.

00:03:06.154 --> 00:03:07.206
LAURA: Let's do it, oh my gosh.

00:03:07.206 --> 00:03:09.058
Alright folks, let's go
ahead and bring us down

00:03:09.058 --> 00:03:13.411
back into tonight's
episode of Critical Role.

00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:19.484
(spooky ethereal music)

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:23.327
(heavy breathing)

00:03:23.327 --> 00:03:25.494
(roaring)

00:03:26.602 --> 00:03:29.352
(dramatic music)

00:03:39.263 --> 00:03:41.680
(gun firing)

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.081
Welcome back.

00:04:48.081 --> 00:04:50.788
So, last we left off,
the party having found

00:04:50.788 --> 00:04:52.675
their way back to the city of Westruun,

00:04:52.675 --> 00:04:54.948
which had been overrun by the herd of

00:04:54.948 --> 00:04:59.115
roving nomadic tribal barbarians
and other such brigands

00:05:00.796 --> 00:05:03.273
that wander the landscape of Talâ€™Dorei

00:05:03.273 --> 00:05:04.865
that Grog once belonged to,

00:05:04.865 --> 00:05:06.796
had swooped in and taken Westruun

00:05:06.796 --> 00:05:09.833
after the Chroma Conclave dragon attack

00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:11.998
across this countryside.

00:05:11.998 --> 00:05:16.198
The party had devised a plan
to find their way into the town

00:05:16.198 --> 00:05:17.638
or at least one of them would,

00:05:17.638 --> 00:05:21.683
distract a cluster of these
individuals, these Goliaths,

00:05:21.683 --> 00:05:23.533
many of which are, you
know, half-giant Goliaths

00:05:23.533 --> 00:05:25.885
pulling them out of the
city into a large pit

00:05:25.885 --> 00:05:27.457
that had been hidden after being carved

00:05:27.457 --> 00:05:29.571
by the druid Keyleth.

00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:31.435
Scanlan went into be the distraction.

00:05:31.435 --> 00:05:33.310
Becoming invisible, leaping to the center

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.395
of the main town square,

00:05:34.395 --> 00:05:35.689
right in front of the margrave's house,

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:39.772
where apparently the leader
of this clan, Kevdak,

00:05:40.836 --> 00:05:44.088
which has a long history
with Grog, resides.

00:05:44.088 --> 00:05:47.188
As part of this distraction,
Scanlan released a thunderwave

00:05:47.188 --> 00:05:49.694
and in doing so unknowingly
also revealed himself

00:05:49.694 --> 00:05:51.967
as the invisibility spell went away.

00:05:51.967 --> 00:05:55.488
And an entire cluster
of very angry-looking

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:58.580
individuals bared down on him,

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.395
managed to escape thanks
to dimension door,

00:06:00.395 --> 00:06:02.128
twice and made your way into the

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:04.727
partially ruined Temple of Arathis

00:06:04.727 --> 00:06:07.293
where you came face to
face with a number of

00:06:07.293 --> 00:06:10.274
refugee Westruun villagers and

00:06:10.274 --> 00:06:12.191
Dr. Dranzel and Kaylee.

00:06:14.476 --> 00:06:16.128
And that is where we left off so

00:06:16.128 --> 00:06:18.933
after appearing and having
a moment of realizing

00:06:18.933 --> 00:06:22.704
the scenario, you see a handful of people,

00:06:22.704 --> 00:06:26.371
most of them filthy,
completely beleaguered,

00:06:28.273 --> 00:06:31.640
and in need of not being
in this circumstance

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.492
as long as they possibly can.

00:06:33.492 --> 00:06:36.698
And you can see Kaylee kinda
holding them back defensively

00:06:36.698 --> 00:06:38.518
and Dranzel, having just
noticed your appearance

00:06:38.518 --> 00:06:40.137
and calling out to you with a chuckle,

00:06:40.137 --> 00:06:41.298
realizing that you're here and

00:06:41.298 --> 00:06:44.069
Kaylee rolling her eyes,
apparently unable to really escape

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:47.980
through fate, though there
is a look, a brief glance of

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.345
appreciation that at least you're not

00:06:50.345 --> 00:06:53.728
burnt to a crisp somewhere outside Emon.

00:06:53.728 --> 00:06:55.842
But Dranzel walks up to you and is like,

00:06:55.842 --> 00:06:56.675
as hush as he can be,

00:06:56.675 --> 00:07:00.258
"Scanlan, so glad to
see that you survived.

00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:04.065
"What are you doing here?"

00:07:04.065 --> 00:07:05.037
SCANLAN: Well...

00:07:05.037 --> 00:07:06.268
Doctor...

00:07:06.268 --> 00:07:09.018
there will be plenty of time for,

00:07:09.923 --> 00:07:11.757
for festive reunions and...

00:07:11.757 --> 00:07:15.066
hopefully tearful hellos but right now

00:07:15.066 --> 00:07:18.307
I'm afraid we have a bit of problem.

00:07:18.307 --> 00:07:21.992
See, my friends are stationed
outside the main gate,

00:07:21.992 --> 00:07:24.090
lying in wait for these Goliaths

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.105
that are terrorizing the town.

00:07:26.105 --> 00:07:27.966
My mission was to come in here and

00:07:27.966 --> 00:07:32.207
somehow convince the Goliaths
to leave through the main gate

00:07:32.207 --> 00:07:34.219
and my mission is not
complete, and I'm afraid,

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:36.640
well, I've roused them and they're

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.336
going to come in here and kill us all.

00:07:40.336 --> 00:07:44.387
Unless I get them
out through the main gate.

00:07:44.387 --> 00:07:46.992
So, we're in a bit of a time crunch.

00:07:46.992 --> 00:07:47.988
Hi.

00:07:47.988 --> 00:07:50.999
And Doctor, Doctor, you are

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:53.534
such a long friend of mine
and a trusted companion

00:07:53.534 --> 00:07:57.701
but I'm afraid, though I love
you, I uh - you cannot help me.

00:07:58.702 --> 00:08:01.119
I need Kaylee's help in this.

00:08:02.057 --> 00:08:03.406
At which point, Dranzel,

00:08:03.406 --> 00:08:05.310
whose face has fallen into a look of

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.477
absolute fear and despair to confusion

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.153
to mild frustration.

00:08:12.153 --> 00:08:15.867
Continues still glaring
in your face, goes,

00:08:15.867 --> 00:08:17.714
"Well, I guess some things
don't change over time,

00:08:17.714 --> 00:08:18.833
"you son of a bitch.

00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:20.396
(laughing)

00:08:20.396 --> 00:08:22.146
"Okay, well, Kaylee?"

00:08:23.466 --> 00:08:24.594
And he looks over his shoulder and

00:08:24.594 --> 00:08:27.744
Kaylee kinda steps up now
and brushes off her shoulder.

00:08:27.744 --> 00:08:30.227
"All right, so what kind of business

00:08:30.227 --> 00:08:32.847
"am I getting you out of now, father?"

00:08:32.847 --> 00:08:36.083
Well, not just, not
just getting me out of.

00:08:36.083 --> 00:08:40.379
I'm afraid, I'm afraid we'll
all die if you don't help.

00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:42.003
KAYLEE: "Great, great, that's fantastic."

00:08:42.003 --> 00:08:42.836
I'm sorry.

00:08:42.836 --> 00:08:43.953
"You've just banished all of these

00:08:43.953 --> 00:08:45.398
"fine folks to their demise.

00:08:45.398 --> 00:08:46.255
"Do you feel good?"

00:08:46.255 --> 00:08:48.396
No, no I haven't, not if you help, so...

00:08:48.396 --> 00:08:51.668
Listen, I've been
thinking a lot about you,

00:08:51.668 --> 00:08:53.487
and it's so wonderful to see you and

00:08:53.487 --> 00:08:56.951
I just need you to trust me in this and,

00:08:56.951 --> 00:09:01.785
and lend me your talents
and your magic if you can.

00:09:01.785 --> 00:09:03.785
Will you trust me today?

00:09:05.096 --> 00:09:08.145
"Doesn't seem like I really
have much of a choice."

00:09:08.145 --> 00:09:10.289
At which point you hear
in the outside footfalls,

00:09:10.289 --> 00:09:12.245
heavy footfalls, going in the street

00:09:12.245 --> 00:09:13.873
on the outside of the
temple and you hear some

00:09:13.873 --> 00:09:15.189
shouting muffled in the distance.

00:09:15.189 --> 00:09:17.171
(muffled shouting)

00:09:17.171 --> 00:09:20.982
(mimics heavy footsteps)

00:09:20.982 --> 00:09:24.758
Everyone kinda stays
really still and silent.

00:09:24.758 --> 00:09:26.008
And then you...

00:09:28.386 --> 00:09:29.219
Hear a few more footsteps.

00:09:29.219 --> 00:09:31.603
(mimics footsteps)

00:09:31.603 --> 00:09:33.797
(mimics loud crash)

00:09:33.797 --> 00:09:35.808
On a partially broken door of the temple,

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:38.350
some heavy hand falls hit
and everyone just kinda

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.994
ducks down and the air
leaves the room entirely.

00:09:41.994 --> 00:09:46.013
At which point there's a moment of pause,

00:09:46.013 --> 00:09:50.122
and the door begins to push
open against all the rocks

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:52.283
and this barricade that's
been placed against the door

00:09:52.283 --> 00:09:56.450
slides against the ground,
opens ever so slightly.

00:09:59.955 --> 00:10:02.346
Quiet still stands and you
see these fingers come through

00:10:02.346 --> 00:10:04.544
and pull it and another voice say,

00:10:04.544 --> 00:10:08.711
"Hey, give me a hand here,
this one's barricaded."

00:10:10.453 --> 00:10:12.288
The door slides a couple more inches

00:10:12.288 --> 00:10:14.574
and you see an arm come through.

00:10:14.574 --> 00:10:17.570
Now holding against the side of the room.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.111
Another arm comes out.

00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:20.228
Shit.

00:10:20.228 --> 00:10:23.664
Can I grab Kaylee and get everyone to,

00:10:23.664 --> 00:10:25.335
is there anywhere to hide in this room?

00:10:25.335 --> 00:10:26.882
Any place in the back?

00:10:26.882 --> 00:10:28.887
We'll it's a partially collapsed, like,

00:10:28.887 --> 00:10:30.148
half-ceiling area that's part of the

00:10:30.148 --> 00:10:31.923
temple on the second floor.

00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:34.053
There is an area beneath
the spiral staircase

00:10:34.053 --> 00:10:35.380
that leads to the second floor

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.779
that can fit most of the people there.

00:10:38.779 --> 00:10:39.612
Okay.

00:10:39.612 --> 00:10:42.893
I'm going to very quickly,
and with her help,

00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:45.600
usher everybody back into this back stair.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.433
MATT: Okay.

00:10:46.433 --> 00:10:49.266
Turn around, blow my horn of fog

00:10:50.187 --> 00:10:52.273
to fill the room partially with smoke.

00:10:52.273 --> 00:10:53.251
MATT: Okay.

00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:56.518
And then I'm going to tell Kaylee,

00:10:56.518 --> 00:10:59.370
can you throw your voice?

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.350
After that.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:01.751
(mimics horn)

00:11:01.751 --> 00:11:04.053
Just fills with this heavy, heavy mist,

00:11:04.053 --> 00:11:05.694
obscuring the vision of
most everyone in the room

00:11:05.694 --> 00:11:08.036
that isn't directly at your side.

00:11:08.036 --> 00:11:09.638
You hear the voice at the door go,

00:11:09.638 --> 00:11:11.816
"Hey, what's that coming out here?"

00:11:11.816 --> 00:11:13.296
And then now fighting
heavily against the door

00:11:13.296 --> 00:11:14.553
and it's slamming against the barricade.

00:11:14.553 --> 00:11:16.465
(mimics banging and slamming)

00:11:16.465 --> 00:11:20.564
Kaylee, kind of getting a
feel for what's happening.

00:11:20.564 --> 00:11:22.814
"All right, what can I do?"

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:27.714
You can throw your voice, I've
seen you do it once, right.

00:11:27.714 --> 00:11:28.547
KAYLEE: I can, I can.

00:11:28.547 --> 00:11:30.481
Can you change your voice?

00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:31.632
I can.

00:11:31.632 --> 00:11:33.255
Okay.

00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:34.338
Can you be...

00:11:35.742 --> 00:11:37.861
the scariest fucking
voice you've ever done

00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:39.153
in your entire life?

00:11:39.153 --> 00:11:42.053
I will tell you what to
say, I'll whisper it to you.

00:11:42.053 --> 00:11:45.260
You just be the voice, I will
be the visuals, all right?

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.111
I'm gonna create an image,

00:11:47.111 --> 00:11:49.098
and you're going to talk
out of it, all right?

00:11:49.098 --> 00:11:50.009
All right, all right.

00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:50.842
Let's go.

00:11:52.266 --> 00:11:53.099
Okay.

00:11:53.099 --> 00:11:55.996
So I will use just a minor illusion

00:11:55.996 --> 00:11:59.209
to create the head of Stonejaw Strongjaw.

00:11:59.209 --> 00:12:00.814
Yes!

00:12:00.814 --> 00:12:01.754
MATT: Jaw Jaw?

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:03.138
ALL: Jaw Jaw!

00:12:03.138 --> 00:12:05.869
(laughing)

00:12:05.869 --> 00:12:07.528
TRAVIS: Okay, I like this.

00:12:07.528 --> 00:12:08.746
(laughing)

00:12:08.746 --> 00:12:09.908
LIAM: Aw, me so sorry.

00:12:09.908 --> 00:12:12.158
(laughing)

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:15.028
GROG: You talkin' about my family now?

00:12:15.028 --> 00:12:17.856
(laughing)

00:12:17.856 --> 00:12:19.189
All right, so.

00:12:20.191 --> 00:12:22.183
GROG: I'm no fuckin' Gungan.

00:12:22.183 --> 00:12:24.433
(laughing)

00:12:25.473 --> 00:12:26.754
So.

00:12:26.754 --> 00:12:28.697
As the essence of minor illusion,

00:12:28.697 --> 00:12:31.181
it is a very, very simple illusion.

00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:32.014
SAM: For sure.

00:12:32.014 --> 00:12:35.847
As far as I know, it
can't even really move.

00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:39.154
SAM: Yeah.

00:12:39.154 --> 00:12:39.987
It can be an image.

00:12:39.987 --> 00:12:40.820
Yeah, that's fine.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.390
It's gonna be floating amongst fog.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.196
Okay, so within this fog,

00:12:45.196 --> 00:12:46.662
you see as they push through the door,

00:12:46.662 --> 00:12:48.555
the barricade clatters down.

00:12:48.555 --> 00:12:50.370
A section of a table and a chair and

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.750
a lot of the rubble that was kinda scooped

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.802
up from the roof that had caved in

00:12:53.802 --> 00:12:56.309
jammed against this
door gets skirted back,

00:12:56.309 --> 00:12:59.702
tumbles and clatters
across the stone work.

00:12:59.702 --> 00:13:01.571
And you see one Goliath

00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:03.280
and one kind of rough-looking human

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.884
with a ragged beard come rushing in.

00:13:04.884 --> 00:13:07.301
You know, dual hand axes drawn

00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:09.480
and looking about the fog as suddenly,

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.147
out of the middle of this space,

00:13:12.988 --> 00:13:16.220
a giant semi-translucent disembodied head

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:20.387
of what you recall is a
(laughs) Stonejaw Strongjaw.

00:13:23.382 --> 00:13:25.598
(laughing)

00:13:25.598 --> 00:13:27.048
MARISHA: Wilson.

00:13:27.048 --> 00:13:27.881
Wilson.

00:13:30.706 --> 00:13:32.547
Standing there, leaning
forward at a large,

00:13:32.547 --> 00:13:34.130
though, you know...

00:13:35.683 --> 00:13:38.082
I will say, though, initially,
what is your DC on this?

00:13:38.082 --> 00:13:40.476
It's through the hand cone.

00:13:40.476 --> 00:13:41.919
So it's 20.

00:13:41.919 --> 00:13:42.752
Okay.

00:13:42.752 --> 00:13:43.585
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

00:13:43.585 --> 00:13:45.029
They both stop and just kinda go,

00:13:45.029 --> 00:13:46.158
"Uh...

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:47.606
(laughing)

00:13:47.606 --> 00:13:49.977
"Are you seeing what I'm seeing?"

00:13:49.977 --> 00:13:52.109
The human's like,

00:13:52.109 --> 00:13:52.942
"Yeah."

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.080
And there's just a moment of pause there,

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.255
and Kaylee's looking at you like...

00:13:57.255 --> 00:14:00.192
Okay, really quick,
here's your motivation.

00:14:00.192 --> 00:14:02.021
You're a dead Goliath,

00:14:02.021 --> 00:14:06.367
you were killed in combat
by one of your own.

00:14:06.367 --> 00:14:08.288
And you probably sound
really scary and fucked up.

00:14:08.288 --> 00:14:09.121
Ready, go.

00:14:10.268 --> 00:14:13.972
Okay I tell her I am Stonejaw Strongjaw.

00:14:13.972 --> 00:14:15.728
She puts her hands together and

00:14:15.728 --> 00:14:19.390
clasps almost like the grass
reeds that you blow into.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:20.486
But as she speaks into her hand,

00:14:20.486 --> 00:14:23.736
it sends out these rippling, kind of...

00:14:25.153 --> 00:14:27.230
Almost like a heat distortion

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.795
that kind of just
scatters out from her hand

00:14:28.795 --> 00:14:31.463
and outside of this central illusion,

00:14:31.463 --> 00:14:33.916
you hear a voice, comes booming forward,

00:14:33.916 --> 00:14:35.124
"I--"

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:36.171
SAM: Fuck yes.

00:14:36.171 --> 00:14:38.254
"Am Stonejaw Strongjaw.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.468
"Returned from the realm of the dead."

00:14:43.468 --> 00:14:44.959
Yes, yes, yes, that's good.

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:47.247
Keep going, keep going,
you're doing great!

00:14:47.247 --> 00:14:48.147
I love you!

00:14:48.147 --> 00:14:49.193
Okay, uh--

00:14:49.193 --> 00:14:51.063
(laughing)

00:14:51.063 --> 00:14:55.230
Kevdak's son Zanror killed
me in dishonorable combat!

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.244
(laughing)

00:14:57.244 --> 00:14:59.911
"Kevdak's son Zanror killed me

00:15:01.654 --> 00:15:03.737
"in dishonorable combat!"

00:15:05.884 --> 00:15:07.660
I can't go to the other side

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.531
until I have avenged my death.

00:15:10.531 --> 00:15:14.427
"I cannot move on to the other side

00:15:14.427 --> 00:15:16.927
"until I've avenged my death!"

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.801
(laughing)

00:15:20.801 --> 00:15:23.051
(growling)

00:15:28.918 --> 00:15:31.736
The Goliath goes, "Sorry, then."

00:15:31.736 --> 00:15:34.777
(laughing)

00:15:34.777 --> 00:15:36.385
As he steps out of the room,

00:15:36.385 --> 00:15:37.841
the guy with the straggled beard who

00:15:37.841 --> 00:15:40.948
you gather is of a different type

00:15:40.948 --> 00:15:42.879
of a tribal background than the Goliaths,

00:15:42.879 --> 00:15:46.212
just kind of gleans an eye untrustingly.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.447
"Yeah, Strongjaw, you say,

00:15:50.879 --> 00:15:52.725
"how strong is that jaw of yours?"

00:15:52.725 --> 00:15:54.534
And throws an ax towards it.

00:15:54.534 --> 00:15:57.692
It just passes through
and clatters behind.

00:15:57.692 --> 00:15:58.525
Okay.

00:15:58.525 --> 00:16:02.358
Quick, say "You idiot,
I am but a projection".

00:16:04.642 --> 00:16:05.725
"You idiot!

00:16:06.708 --> 00:16:07.541
(laughing)

00:16:07.541 --> 00:16:10.282
"I am but a projection!"

00:16:10.282 --> 00:16:13.678
The real Stonejaw is currently
outside the main gate,

00:16:13.678 --> 00:16:17.595
waiting for a battle of
revenge against Zanror.

00:16:18.453 --> 00:16:19.576
Send him now.

00:16:19.576 --> 00:16:21.170
MARISHA: That's a lot.
SAM: I know.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:22.234
Sorry, Kaylee.

00:16:22.234 --> 00:16:26.401
"The real Zanror stands outside
this city gate, waiting...

00:16:31.922 --> 00:16:34.747
"For vengeance against Zanror!"

00:16:34.747 --> 00:16:37.395
You're doing great, you're doing great!

00:16:37.395 --> 00:16:40.978
"Bring him now, or you all shall suffer!"

00:16:41.884 --> 00:16:43.245
That last part was improv!

00:16:43.245 --> 00:16:44.387
That was amazing, Kaylee!

00:16:44.387 --> 00:16:45.858
(laughing)

00:16:45.858 --> 00:16:48.108
(grunting)

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:51.509
There's like a slight pause.

00:16:56.423 --> 00:16:58.080
"Can I have my axe back?"

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.913
I motion to Dr. Dra to
throw it back to him.

00:17:05.176 --> 00:17:07.261
He runs over, feels for it, looks around.

00:17:07.261 --> 00:17:09.247
SAM: Throw it hard!

00:17:09.247 --> 00:17:11.241
"I will throw it hard!"

00:17:11.241 --> 00:17:14.300
No, no, don't say that
part, don't say that part!

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.133
(laughing)

00:17:15.133 --> 00:17:15.996
It's fine, you're doing great.

00:17:15.996 --> 00:17:18.338
He starts backing up towards the door.

00:17:18.338 --> 00:17:21.872
At which point, the ax
just clatters past him,

00:17:21.872 --> 00:17:23.608
slams into the door behind him.

00:17:23.608 --> 00:17:27.309
He reaches up without
looking and he grabs it.

00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:28.288
"Thank you."

00:17:28.288 --> 00:17:30.024
The main gate, the main gate!

00:17:30.024 --> 00:17:31.774
"The main gate."

00:17:31.774 --> 00:17:33.170
SAM: Wow!

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.631
"There's like four gates into the city.

00:17:34.631 --> 00:17:35.930
"Which main gate?"

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.101
I don't know, do I know
what it looks like?

00:17:38.101 --> 00:17:38.934
MATT: The western one.

00:17:38.934 --> 00:17:39.987
The western gate, the western gate!

00:17:39.987 --> 00:17:41.737
"The western gate!"

00:17:42.585 --> 00:17:43.795
(laughing)

00:17:43.795 --> 00:17:45.943
"Right, right, I'll let him know."

00:17:45.943 --> 00:17:47.013
And he just leaves.

00:17:47.013 --> 00:17:48.381
Doesn't even touch the door,
he just bolts out the back.

00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:49.597
(laughing)

00:17:49.597 --> 00:17:52.203
LAURA: Oh man, I love this so much.

00:17:52.203 --> 00:17:53.785
There's a moment of quiet.

00:17:53.785 --> 00:17:56.275
(laughing)

00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:57.141
I just hope that works.

00:17:57.141 --> 00:17:59.290
Dr. Dranzel walks by.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:01.864
(chuckles)

00:18:01.864 --> 00:18:04.633
"I have to say, you two
make quite the team."

00:18:04.633 --> 00:18:07.383
I would say that as well, yes, I would.

00:18:07.383 --> 00:18:09.748
Thank you, Kaylee, that was...

00:18:09.748 --> 00:18:11.943
Better than I could have ever done.

00:18:11.943 --> 00:18:13.110
That's true.

00:18:14.104 --> 00:18:16.473
"All right then, so...

00:18:16.473 --> 00:18:18.498
"We're getting people out of here.

00:18:18.498 --> 00:18:21.105
"Things have gone a bit up.

00:18:21.105 --> 00:18:23.813
"How are we gonna get the
rest of these folks out?"

00:18:23.813 --> 00:18:26.022
And Dranzel thinks for a second, he goes,

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:27.663
"Well, we can't wait for
the rest of the team.

00:18:27.663 --> 00:18:32.199
"They're probably still on
their way back from Kymal.

00:18:32.199 --> 00:18:33.416
"I've unfortunately mostly spent

00:18:33.416 --> 00:18:36.011
"my capabilities for the day.

00:18:36.011 --> 00:18:39.013
"Scanlan, what do you got?"

00:18:39.013 --> 00:18:40.846
To keep us all safe?

00:18:41.744 --> 00:18:44.283
"No, to get the rest of
these poor saps out!"

00:18:44.283 --> 00:18:46.191
Out of the city?

00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:47.884
Jesus, uh...

00:18:47.884 --> 00:18:49.929
"Were you gonna leave
them here unguarded?"

00:18:49.929 --> 00:18:52.235
Oh, no, of course I'm not
gonna leave them unguarded!

00:18:52.235 --> 00:18:54.029
I just, I mean, we can't...

00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:56.098
How many people are here?

00:18:56.098 --> 00:18:59.931
You look around the room,
there's nine people.

00:19:07.484 --> 00:19:09.228
I can get me and Kaylee out.

00:19:09.228 --> 00:19:11.478
(laughing)

00:19:15.227 --> 00:19:17.003
I think we should just hunker down.

00:19:17.003 --> 00:19:18.307
(laughs)

00:19:18.307 --> 00:19:20.807
I can't get us out, I'm sorry!

00:19:21.942 --> 00:19:23.293
I mean, we could sneak, we could sneak,

00:19:23.293 --> 00:19:25.066
we could try to make a sneak for it.

00:19:25.066 --> 00:19:26.892
Are there sewers here?

00:19:26.892 --> 00:19:28.105
Kaylee nods.

00:19:28.105 --> 00:19:30.920
"There are sewers, aye."

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.753
Close by?

00:19:31.753 --> 00:19:34.086
Is there an entrance nearby?

00:19:35.024 --> 00:19:36.201
"About two blocks that way."

00:19:36.201 --> 00:19:38.476
And she points to the
south side of the city.

00:19:38.476 --> 00:19:39.309
Okay.

00:19:39.309 --> 00:19:40.485
KAYLEE: "Should we wait for your friends,

00:19:40.485 --> 00:19:42.161
or should we go ahead
and take this route?"

00:19:42.161 --> 00:19:43.003
We should wait and make sure that

00:19:43.003 --> 00:19:45.378
we hear Goliath footsteps leaving the city

00:19:45.378 --> 00:19:47.711
before we move, and then go.

00:19:48.857 --> 00:19:50.465
"All right.

00:19:50.465 --> 00:19:52.027
"Let's take a moment
and make sure at least

00:19:52.027 --> 00:19:54.944
"all the chaos is moving that way."

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.199
Quiet takes over as the fog slowly fades

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:01.669
over the next few minutes,
and we all stay out of sight.

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:04.112
Now, the rest of you guys
are currently waiting

00:20:04.112 --> 00:20:06.728
on the outskirts of the
western side of town.

00:20:06.728 --> 00:20:10.952
You hear the bells going
off in the distance.

00:20:10.952 --> 00:20:12.202
You hear the...

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.945
The sound of shouts as the
guards that were at that post

00:20:15.945 --> 00:20:17.651
start stepping back inward,

00:20:17.651 --> 00:20:19.594
trying to figure out what's going on.

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:20.746
At this distance, it's hard to make out

00:20:20.746 --> 00:20:22.412
exactly what conversation is happening,

00:20:22.412 --> 00:20:24.558
but the energy of the outside of the city

00:20:24.558 --> 00:20:26.769
has definitely climbed up a few paces.

00:20:26.769 --> 00:20:28.648
Which leads you to believe,

00:20:28.648 --> 00:20:32.209
hopefully, this means
Scanlan's done his job.

00:20:32.209 --> 00:20:33.704
We shall find out.

00:20:33.704 --> 00:20:34.537
Is there any other preparation

00:20:34.537 --> 00:20:35.458
you guys wanna go through right now,

00:20:35.458 --> 00:20:37.721
or are you just waiting to
see any sign of movement?

00:20:37.721 --> 00:20:39.880
Are we all, like, together

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.706
or are we spread out across everything?

00:20:42.706 --> 00:20:43.599
We're birds.

00:20:43.599 --> 00:20:44.432
LAURA: You're birds.

00:20:44.432 --> 00:20:45.265
MARISHA: We're birds on a wall.

00:20:45.265 --> 00:20:47.873
We're standing together
in, like, the tall grass.

00:20:47.873 --> 00:20:48.833
That's right.

00:20:48.833 --> 00:20:49.666
Okay.

00:20:50.721 --> 00:20:51.869
LAURA: We're with everybody else.

00:20:51.869 --> 00:20:53.601
I'm gonna take a minute to--

00:20:53.601 --> 00:20:55.191
anybody standing near me, I'm gonna

00:20:55.191 --> 00:20:57.524
take a minute and use, um...

00:20:59.963 --> 00:21:00.796
Where's my thing?

00:21:00.796 --> 00:21:02.701
I'm freaking out!

00:21:02.701 --> 00:21:04.534
Hide in plain sight?

00:21:04.534 --> 00:21:05.367
MATT: All righty.

00:21:05.367 --> 00:21:08.315
And make it to where we can
set a surprise attack on them.

00:21:08.315 --> 00:21:09.636
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Anybody coming out.

00:21:09.636 --> 00:21:10.528
All right.

00:21:10.528 --> 00:21:11.361
All right.

00:21:11.361 --> 00:21:12.194
So, as part of that, I'll have you guys

00:21:12.194 --> 00:21:14.277
both roll stealth checks.

00:21:16.986 --> 00:21:17.819
LIAM: Sure.

00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:19.808
(laughing)

00:21:19.808 --> 00:21:20.902
Do we still, is the Pass Without Trace

00:21:20.902 --> 00:21:22.885
still active from before?

00:21:22.885 --> 00:21:23.718
I think it is.

00:21:23.718 --> 00:21:25.490
I think you cast it before you arrived,

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:26.701
or in the approach, so, yeah.

00:21:26.701 --> 00:21:29.153
LAURA: Okay, so add 10 to that.

00:21:29.153 --> 00:21:30.567
LIAM: 35.
LAURA: 35!

00:21:30.567 --> 00:21:31.871
MATT: Oh, look at that.

00:21:31.871 --> 00:21:33.871
Hopefully that's enough.

00:21:35.903 --> 00:21:37.526
It's like that scene in Willow where--

00:21:37.526 --> 00:21:38.790
TALIESIN: All right, um, since we're birds.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.957
I want to take it, just an
occasional high-level...

00:21:44.928 --> 00:21:46.054
MARISHA: Circle around?
TALIESIN: Circle around,

00:21:46.054 --> 00:21:47.266
just to see what's up.

00:21:47.266 --> 00:21:51.266
Okay, both of you guys
roll perception checks.

00:21:52.614 --> 00:21:53.648
MARISHA: 26.

00:21:53.648 --> 00:21:55.227
TALIESIN: Uh, 18.

00:21:55.227 --> 00:21:56.060
MATT: 26, 18?

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:56.893
Yeah.

00:21:56.893 --> 00:21:57.726
Oh.

00:21:57.726 --> 00:21:59.653
(excited heavy breathing)

00:21:59.653 --> 00:22:01.287
LAURA: Oh, see, that's
what we could do, Matt!

00:22:01.287 --> 00:22:02.812
We could've just sat you on the

00:22:02.812 --> 00:22:03.733
same side of the table as us.

00:22:03.733 --> 00:22:05.315
Yeah, you could've been behind us and...

00:22:05.315 --> 00:22:06.202
MATT: Oh, that's true.

00:22:06.202 --> 00:22:07.035
That is true.

00:22:07.035 --> 00:22:08.541
Oh well, too late now.

00:22:08.541 --> 00:22:09.874
All right, so...

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:12.767
(whispers inaudibly)

00:22:12.767 --> 00:22:16.632
Any products you want me to
hawk while the camera's on us?

00:22:16.632 --> 00:22:18.040
Those shirts, man!

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:18.873
SAM: These shirts?

00:22:18.873 --> 00:22:19.706
Not those shirts, these shirts!

00:22:19.706 --> 00:22:20.809
How do you wanna do this?

00:22:20.809 --> 00:22:21.943
How do you wanna do this?

00:22:21.943 --> 00:22:23.007
We already hawked those.

00:22:23.007 --> 00:22:24.114
TRAVIS: The hoodie and the T-shirt!

00:22:24.114 --> 00:22:24.947
T-shirts in stock, one more week.

00:22:24.947 --> 00:22:25.950
How do you want to do this?

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.329
T-shirts are now available for something.

00:22:28.329 --> 00:22:29.872
Pre-order?

00:22:29.872 --> 00:22:31.189
LAURA: Also pre-order for another week.

00:22:31.189 --> 00:22:32.179
I don't know, man!

00:22:32.179 --> 00:22:33.841
Also, also the necklaces and

00:22:33.841 --> 00:22:35.399
the keychains are still there.

00:22:35.399 --> 00:22:36.670
Necklaces and keychains?

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:38.586
But those are a fantastic
birthday or Christmas gift.

00:22:38.586 --> 00:22:39.419
LAURA: They really are!

00:22:39.419 --> 00:22:40.449
ASHLEY: What are the necklaces?

00:22:40.449 --> 00:22:41.282
LAURA: The necklaces?

00:22:41.282 --> 00:22:42.115
We still haven't gotten to those!

00:22:42.115 --> 00:22:42.948
Arbor Day seems like a good--

00:22:42.948 --> 00:22:43.781
Memorial Day.

00:22:43.781 --> 00:22:44.614
Memorial Day!

00:22:44.614 --> 00:22:45.661
People give gifts on Memorial Day.

00:22:45.661 --> 00:22:46.808
I got gifts on Memorial Day.

00:22:46.808 --> 00:22:47.641
Yeah.

00:22:47.641 --> 00:22:50.680
So underneath your Memorial
Day tree this year...

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.513
It's cute.

00:22:51.513 --> 00:22:52.792
It's like steel.

00:22:52.792 --> 00:22:53.625
All right.

00:22:53.625 --> 00:22:54.458
Oh my gosh.

00:22:54.458 --> 00:22:55.824
So.

00:22:55.824 --> 00:22:56.657
ASHLEY: Umm...

00:22:56.657 --> 00:22:57.490
Yes, Pike.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.990
Can I cast Guardian of Faith

00:23:01.223 --> 00:23:04.735
near us, where we are hiding at the gate?

00:23:04.735 --> 00:23:05.568
MATT: If you'd like to.

00:23:05.568 --> 00:23:06.401
Yes.

00:23:06.401 --> 00:23:08.353
Uh, on your location on the
gate, or somewhere else?

00:23:08.353 --> 00:23:10.849
Because we're all, we're all together

00:23:10.849 --> 00:23:12.630
by the hole that you dug.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:13.463
Aren't we--

00:23:13.463 --> 00:23:14.296
We're like, in the--

00:23:14.296 --> 00:23:15.129
We're in the grass.

00:23:15.129 --> 00:23:16.801
In the grass, down toward the front,

00:23:16.801 --> 00:23:19.457
kind of farther back from the gate.

00:23:19.457 --> 00:23:21.514
Where are you guys standing right now?

00:23:21.514 --> 00:23:22.347
TRAVIS: Are you--

00:23:22.347 --> 00:23:23.671
'Cause the twins are by themselves, right?

00:23:23.671 --> 00:23:24.504
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:24.504 --> 00:23:25.734
Ah, so we're all apart.

00:23:25.734 --> 00:23:28.780
Yeah, you and Grog are kind
of your own pod right now.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.613
Oh, hi Grog.

00:23:29.613 --> 00:23:30.446
Hey.

00:23:30.446 --> 00:23:31.747
I just forgot you were--

00:23:31.747 --> 00:23:33.185
Just us chillin'.

00:23:33.185 --> 00:23:34.018
(laughing)

00:23:34.018 --> 00:23:36.268
About to split some skulls.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.732
You know what, I'm gonna
pause, I'm gonna pause.

00:23:39.732 --> 00:23:40.565
MATT: Okay, you gonna hold off?

00:23:40.565 --> 00:23:41.398
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:23:41.398 --> 00:23:42.231
All right, so, you guys,
what are you doing?

00:23:42.231 --> 00:23:44.307
(mimicking birds)

00:23:44.307 --> 00:23:45.140
TRAVIS: Jesus.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.841
Okay, I'm on the wall, right?

00:23:47.841 --> 00:23:49.865
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:23:49.865 --> 00:23:53.556
I'm gonna kind of, like,
scootch back a little bit

00:23:53.556 --> 00:23:54.389
so I'm kind of hidden.

00:23:54.389 --> 00:23:56.187
I'm gonna drop my animal form.

00:23:56.187 --> 00:23:57.295
MATT: Okay.

00:23:57.295 --> 00:23:59.376
I'm gonna go over the...

00:23:59.376 --> 00:24:00.543
Our earpieces.

00:24:01.524 --> 00:24:02.357
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:24:02.357 --> 00:24:04.593
I'm flying near her so I
can hear, but I can't talk.

00:24:04.593 --> 00:24:06.021
MATT: Okay.

00:24:06.021 --> 00:24:08.598
It looks like there's
about six coming our way.

00:24:08.598 --> 00:24:11.941
I don't know how well
Scanlan's distraction worked.

00:24:11.941 --> 00:24:13.718
It looks like they're double down--

00:24:13.718 --> 00:24:15.651
doubling down and setting up a

00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:17.517
heavy defense in the center of the town.

00:24:17.517 --> 00:24:19.202
MATT: Is Scanlan
listening to you right now?

00:24:19.202 --> 00:24:21.780
Scanlan, can you hear me?

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.613
Scanlan?

00:24:22.613 --> 00:24:23.672
There's no response.

00:24:23.672 --> 00:24:24.594
MARISHA: Shit.

00:24:24.594 --> 00:24:26.279
I think he's too far away,
you guys, I don't know.

00:24:26.279 --> 00:24:28.565
LAURA: Hopefully he wasn't captured.

00:24:28.565 --> 00:24:30.412
There's about six coming this way,

00:24:30.412 --> 00:24:33.389
so stay down, hopefully the trap works.

00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:34.619
I just thought of something.

00:24:34.619 --> 00:24:35.907
Hey, remember when we were, like,

00:24:35.907 --> 00:24:37.082
walking through the woods and we

00:24:37.082 --> 00:24:40.083
fought those six Goliaths
and I stopped the fight?

00:24:40.083 --> 00:24:40.916
Remember?

00:24:40.916 --> 00:24:43.010
Yeah, that was Zanror, right?

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:44.096
Right.

00:24:44.096 --> 00:24:46.138
So I think he knows that I'm not, like,

00:24:46.138 --> 00:24:48.352
back from the dead.

00:24:48.352 --> 00:24:49.900
Well, shit, Grog!

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.881
I know, I just thought
of it, you know, like,

00:24:51.881 --> 00:24:54.162
the whole magic thing
might not actually work.

00:24:54.162 --> 00:24:56.045
So the whole plan we made was stupid?

00:24:56.045 --> 00:24:57.808
No no no, I'm just saying,
let's move forward.

00:24:57.808 --> 00:24:58.987
You're using your father, right?

00:24:58.987 --> 00:25:00.455
Your father is dead, right?

00:25:00.455 --> 00:25:01.629
Your dad's dead?

00:25:01.629 --> 00:25:02.952
LIAM: Yes, yes.
TRAVIS: I don't know.

00:25:02.952 --> 00:25:03.785
LIAM: Yes.
TRAVIS: Yeah, he is, yes.

00:25:03.785 --> 00:25:04.618
He's dead.

00:25:04.618 --> 00:25:05.619
(laughing)

00:25:05.619 --> 00:25:06.452
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:25:06.452 --> 00:25:08.010
LAURA: Yeah, he's dead.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.258
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's dead.

00:25:09.258 --> 00:25:12.008
Okay, well, hopefully it works.

00:25:12.906 --> 00:25:14.058
I don't know how well this is working--

00:25:14.058 --> 00:25:16.547
Just a pro-tip, Vax, what would you say

00:25:16.547 --> 00:25:18.064
is the number one thing to keep in mind

00:25:18.064 --> 00:25:21.383
when fighting someone like me?

00:25:21.383 --> 00:25:22.966
LIAM: Uh, don't?

00:25:23.915 --> 00:25:24.918
Keep your distance.

00:25:24.918 --> 00:25:26.807
Yeah, keep your distance.

00:25:26.807 --> 00:25:29.419
All right, good to know.

00:25:29.419 --> 00:25:33.586
What's our plan B in case
Zanror never comes out?

00:25:35.517 --> 00:25:37.405
VEX: We go in and we kill everyone.

00:25:37.405 --> 00:25:38.625
VAX: Yeah, pretty much.

00:25:38.625 --> 00:25:39.728
Everyone?

00:25:39.728 --> 00:25:41.904
Well, except for the nice people.

00:25:41.904 --> 00:25:42.745
Oh.

00:25:42.745 --> 00:25:44.018
(laughing)

00:25:44.018 --> 00:25:48.408
I haven't decided who the nice people are.

00:25:48.408 --> 00:25:50.040
I think I can confirm that Vox Machina

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.970
has been a terrible influence on me,

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:52.856
just want to throw that out.

00:25:52.856 --> 00:25:53.890
All right, let's go.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:55.071
LAURA: Where are they, where are they?

00:25:55.071 --> 00:25:58.488
I also want to just see if I recognize,

00:26:00.357 --> 00:26:03.855
I'm just doing another little
flippity-flop scan around,

00:26:03.855 --> 00:26:05.103
and I just want to see if I recognize

00:26:05.103 --> 00:26:06.534
his brother as one of the people

00:26:06.534 --> 00:26:09.240
who's coming to the gate or not.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.630
I'll get down low for that.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:11.802
Not a brother, per se.

00:26:11.802 --> 00:26:12.635
TRAVIS: My cousin?

00:26:12.635 --> 00:26:13.601
Your cousin, I mean.

00:26:13.601 --> 00:26:16.059
The one I recognize because
I, the only one I've met.

00:26:16.059 --> 00:26:16.892
MATT: Right.

00:26:16.892 --> 00:26:18.331
At this height?

00:26:18.331 --> 00:26:19.164
I'll get, I'll get--

00:26:19.164 --> 00:26:19.997
MATT: You'll get low?
TALIESIN: I'll get low.

00:26:19.997 --> 00:26:23.826
Okay, you don't see anybody
coming towards that direction

00:26:23.826 --> 00:26:25.135
that resembles the individual that you met

00:26:25.135 --> 00:26:27.592
that one time before.

00:26:27.592 --> 00:26:29.151
Okay, fine.

00:26:29.151 --> 00:26:30.320
I'm gonna go looking.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.897
However, what you do notice is,

00:26:32.897 --> 00:26:34.805
and you quickly duck out of the way,

00:26:34.805 --> 00:26:38.109
there are two giant eagles that come

00:26:38.109 --> 00:26:41.394
coasting over the city
in the same direction.

00:26:41.394 --> 00:26:42.227
(gasps)

00:26:42.227 --> 00:26:43.538
TRAVIS: Giant eagles?

00:26:43.538 --> 00:26:44.850
Okay, I'm gonna go find a perch

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:47.208
on the other side of the gate.

00:26:47.208 --> 00:26:49.735
And I'm gonna find a nice
little sniper's nest.

00:26:49.735 --> 00:26:51.147
I'm assuming you have some clan members

00:26:51.147 --> 00:26:53.897
who might be druids, do you know?

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.941
You're speaking really smart right now

00:26:56.941 --> 00:26:58.444
and it's confusing me.

00:26:58.444 --> 00:26:59.277
(laughing)

00:26:59.277 --> 00:27:00.696
Make sure you're hiding, Keyleth.

00:27:00.696 --> 00:27:02.511
I want to stealth, I kind of want to

00:27:02.511 --> 00:27:03.753
hunker down against the wall and stealth.

00:27:03.753 --> 00:27:04.593
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

00:27:04.593 --> 00:27:08.023
I'm staying bird until
the last possible moment.

00:27:08.023 --> 00:27:09.407
Uh, 21.

00:27:09.407 --> 00:27:10.240
21?

00:27:11.151 --> 00:27:11.984
Hmm.

00:27:13.643 --> 00:27:16.167
VAX: Guys, if no one comes towards the gate

00:27:16.167 --> 00:27:19.501
in the next five, ten minutes--

00:27:19.501 --> 00:27:20.334
KEYLETH: They're on their way.

00:27:20.334 --> 00:27:21.167
They're not going to come.

00:27:21.167 --> 00:27:22.178
Well, all right, I hope so, but

00:27:22.178 --> 00:27:23.823
if nobody's here in ten,
I think we gotta go in.

00:27:23.823 --> 00:27:26.754
MARISHA: So is there anyone coming towards the--

00:27:26.754 --> 00:27:29.860
At this point in time, you
guys on your side notice,

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:33.441
--and you as well--a cluster
of about six individuals

00:27:33.441 --> 00:27:35.188
come rushing towards the gate,

00:27:35.188 --> 00:27:37.076
and the two guards who were
over to the side earlier

00:27:37.076 --> 00:27:39.801
join up with them, they stop for a second,

00:27:39.801 --> 00:27:41.867
and they discuss at a distance.

00:27:41.867 --> 00:27:42.997
Then they all turn and rush

00:27:42.997 --> 00:27:45.121
towards the gate as a group of nine.

00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:45.954
(gasps)

00:27:45.954 --> 00:27:46.900
Come on, trap!

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.817
Work, trap, work, trap!

00:27:49.685 --> 00:27:50.518
MARISHA: Come on!

00:27:50.518 --> 00:27:53.745
As they're rushing forward,
it's about three, two,

00:27:53.745 --> 00:27:55.679
and then a scattered four-ish in the back.

00:27:55.679 --> 00:27:58.762
They go bolting through, eyes around,

00:28:00.275 --> 00:28:02.415
looking for any sort of sight

00:28:02.415 --> 00:28:04.407
of anyone waiting at
the front of the gate.

00:28:04.407 --> 00:28:06.679
They begin to slow
their pace a little bit,

00:28:06.679 --> 00:28:08.392
not seeing anybody immediately out there,

00:28:08.392 --> 00:28:10.685
as they begin to go through
the center of the archway.

00:28:10.685 --> 00:28:12.241
Someone make a distraction, quick!

00:28:12.241 --> 00:28:14.217
I step out from cover,

00:28:14.217 --> 00:28:15.217
very slowly,

00:28:16.805 --> 00:28:19.202
and walk out in the middle of the room.

00:28:19.202 --> 00:28:20.035
Oh, shit.

00:28:20.035 --> 00:28:21.065
Okay, as you step out, they all

00:28:21.065 --> 00:28:23.425
immediately put their hands out and stop

00:28:23.425 --> 00:28:25.842
and to the guards, shout out,

00:28:26.716 --> 00:28:28.549
"You, who goes there?"

00:28:30.377 --> 00:28:33.246
TRAVIS: (heavy breathing, growling)

00:28:33.246 --> 00:28:35.496
(laughing)

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.523
"Stonejaw!"

00:28:42.403 --> 00:28:44.595
(laughing)

00:28:44.595 --> 00:28:48.762
Two of them, of that group,
start stepping backwards

00:28:50.394 --> 00:28:52.461
while the two guards that were

00:28:52.461 --> 00:28:54.926
stationed at the gate, they just go,

00:28:54.926 --> 00:28:56.371
"Cut him down."

00:28:56.371 --> 00:28:58.457
And they go into a run
through the rest of,

00:28:58.457 --> 00:28:59.903
the ten, fifteen-foot area,

00:28:59.903 --> 00:29:01.737
around the center part of the gate

00:29:01.737 --> 00:29:04.119
out into the main area out front.

00:29:04.119 --> 00:29:06.747
As they begin stepping, (mimics footsteps)

00:29:06.747 --> 00:29:07.733
watching in the distance,

00:29:07.733 --> 00:29:10.661
you notice one foot crumbles through,

00:29:10.661 --> 00:29:12.460
and all of a sudden, the second foot,

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.117
and the earth begins to just tumble out

00:29:14.117 --> 00:29:16.450
from underneath two of them.

00:29:20.047 --> 00:29:22.173
Three of them, four of them, five of them.

00:29:22.173 --> 00:29:25.351
All begin just, the first
line, the first two groups,

00:29:25.351 --> 00:29:26.613
weren't even paying attention and

00:29:26.613 --> 00:29:28.318
focused on you as they charged through,

00:29:28.318 --> 00:29:30.474
they all begin to tumble inside--

00:29:30.474 --> 00:29:31.307
Yes!

00:29:34.448 --> 00:29:36.593
The, uh, of the last four, two of them

00:29:36.593 --> 00:29:38.877
manage to stop in time to
kind of catch themselves.

00:29:38.877 --> 00:29:40.919
Of all the ones that fell, though,

00:29:40.919 --> 00:29:43.372
the ones in front who
originally got caught

00:29:43.372 --> 00:29:44.214
have no saving throw.

00:29:44.214 --> 00:29:45.858
They just plummet, screaming, down--

00:29:45.858 --> 00:29:46.955
Two managed not to fall?

00:29:46.955 --> 00:29:47.872
MARISHA: 180 feet.

00:29:48.852 --> 00:29:50.555
SAM: It's 180 feet!

00:29:50.555 --> 00:29:51.555
SAM: Holy god!

00:29:51.823 --> 00:29:52.823
(laughing)

00:29:52.843 --> 00:29:55.203
TALIESIN: Two managed not to fall?

00:29:55.203 --> 00:29:58.857
Two manage to avoid the
entire crumbling portion of it

00:29:58.857 --> 00:30:00.620
and there are three of them that are

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.236
currently holding onto the edges

00:30:02.236 --> 00:30:04.195
and trying to pull themselves back up.

00:30:04.195 --> 00:30:07.069
Can I find, I want to find
a good enough vantage point

00:30:07.069 --> 00:30:09.163
where I'm behind them and
I can give them a push.

00:30:09.163 --> 00:30:10.208
Like, from a distance.

00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:11.041
SAM: As a bird?

00:30:11.041 --> 00:30:11.874
LAURA: You're a bird!

00:30:11.874 --> 00:30:12.813
Well, I was gonna say, I can drop,

00:30:12.813 --> 00:30:14.788
as soon as he lands, I drop his polymorph,

00:30:14.788 --> 00:30:15.727
as soon as he lands.

00:30:15.727 --> 00:30:16.741
LAURA: Well, but I was--

00:30:16.741 --> 00:30:18.121
waiting for a--

00:30:18.121 --> 00:30:18.995
Well, he's on the roof.

00:30:18.995 --> 00:30:20.643
He's on the wall.

00:30:20.643 --> 00:30:22.010
Well, first, I'm gonna determine

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:23.006
how much damage they took.

00:30:23.006 --> 00:30:24.488
(laughing)

00:30:24.488 --> 00:30:25.675
MARISHA: All of it?

00:30:25.675 --> 00:30:27.632
SAM: We are the best at planning.

00:30:27.632 --> 00:30:28.632
MATT: That is...

00:30:31.581 --> 00:30:32.414
MATT: That is...

00:30:34.142 --> 00:30:36.025
MATT: 83 damage to them.

00:30:36.025 --> 00:30:37.225
SAM: 83?

00:30:37.225 --> 00:30:38.266
That's pretty good!

00:30:38.266 --> 00:30:39.275
(laughing)

00:30:39.275 --> 00:30:41.646
MATT: And if I look at the sheets here.

00:30:41.646 --> 00:30:42.781
TRAVIS: That means toast for
any of us.

00:30:42.781 --> 00:30:44.136
SAM: And they're prone.

00:30:44.136 --> 00:30:45.051
(laughing)

00:30:45.051 --> 00:30:46.178
ASHLEY: We would be dead.

00:30:46.178 --> 00:30:47.011
LIAM: That's me.

00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:48.598
Now, you hear a horrible scream

00:30:48.598 --> 00:30:50.443
and a crunch sound as they all,

00:30:50.443 --> 00:30:53.026
those that fell are unconscious

00:30:53.874 --> 00:30:55.221
or currently completely unable--

00:30:55.221 --> 00:30:56.054
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:30:56.962 --> 00:30:59.449
We did something right!

00:30:59.449 --> 00:31:02.506
Low moans of pain barely
echoing up from underneath

00:31:02.506 --> 00:31:03.948
as the other ones, like,

00:31:03.948 --> 00:31:05.570
they grab the arms of the ones 
that are hanging over--

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:06.595
Are they clustered?

00:31:06.595 --> 00:31:07.566
They're clustered in, yeah.

00:31:07.566 --> 00:31:08.399
Ah!

00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:09.485
I want to take two--

00:31:09.485 --> 00:31:10.902
I'm taking two...

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.193
Where's my English?

00:31:14.193 --> 00:31:16.026
Trick shot push shots.

00:31:17.462 --> 00:31:18.483
Okay, go for it.

00:31:18.483 --> 00:31:20.064
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Go for it.

00:31:20.064 --> 00:31:21.061
Push shot number one.

00:31:21.061 --> 00:31:22.660
SAM: (mimics shooting)

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:23.743
Uh, that's...

00:31:24.718 --> 00:31:26.666
That's with retort, I'm not using the big gun.

00:31:26.666 --> 00:31:27.933
18, 19...

00:31:27.933 --> 00:31:29.129
21?

00:31:29.129 --> 00:31:30.578
21 hits.

00:31:30.578 --> 00:31:32.884
And then they, every time
they hit, they take damage,

00:31:32.884 --> 00:31:34.217
and they also...

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.365
Yeah, they don't even have a save.

00:31:39.365 --> 00:31:40.198
MATT: Nope, just pushes them.

00:31:40.198 --> 00:31:43.281
Okay, that's, and then that does...

00:31:46.287 --> 00:31:47.723
14 points of damage.

00:31:47.723 --> 00:31:48.556
MATT: Okay.

00:31:48.556 --> 00:31:49.389
For the one.

00:31:49.389 --> 00:31:52.751
Which then, that one gets
pushed over the side,

00:31:52.751 --> 00:31:54.592
does not make its save
to try to catch the edge,

00:31:54.592 --> 00:31:56.842
plummets down, suffering...

00:31:58.428 --> 00:32:01.581
Just 'cause it's fun to check...

00:32:01.581 --> 00:32:03.217
70 points of damage.

00:32:03.217 --> 00:32:05.826
A sickening smack sound--

00:32:05.826 --> 00:32:06.715
LAURA: Landing on the other ones.

00:32:06.715 --> 00:32:08.030
MATT: Landing on the other ones.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:08.863
It's awful.

00:32:08.863 --> 00:32:10.522
Looking down there would
be terrible right now.

00:32:10.522 --> 00:32:11.355
TALIESIN: Have some taste.

00:32:11.355 --> 00:32:12.772
And the next one?

00:32:13.683 --> 00:32:16.100
Um, that's 17, 27, 30 to hit.

00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:18.742
MATT: That hits.

00:32:18.742 --> 00:32:20.911
Let's go ahead and roll
damage on that one.

00:32:20.911 --> 00:32:22.446
Uh, that's...

00:32:22.446 --> 00:32:24.619
13 points of piercing damage?

00:32:24.619 --> 00:32:25.929
13 points of piercing damage.

00:32:25.929 --> 00:32:27.372
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Plus the push.

00:32:27.372 --> 00:32:28.756
He gets pushed, falls off the edge,

00:32:28.756 --> 00:32:32.306
catches his arm on the side,
and begins pulling himself up.

00:32:32.306 --> 00:32:33.646
Now there's four of them
that are currently now

00:32:33.646 --> 00:32:36.617
about to start climbing
up outside of this,

00:32:36.617 --> 00:32:38.472
this collapsed portion of earth,

00:32:38.472 --> 00:32:39.803
but the earth is still
crumbling beneath them,

00:32:39.803 --> 00:32:40.636
as they're trying--

00:32:40.636 --> 00:32:43.050
I cast, I cast Hail of Thorns

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:46.529
and shoot in the cluster of them.

00:32:46.529 --> 00:32:47.362
Okay.

00:32:49.466 --> 00:32:51.466
Go ahead and make the...

00:32:53.242 --> 00:32:55.275
The Hail of Thorns, it is--

00:32:55.275 --> 00:32:56.970
TALIESIN: Does that drop count as a kill?

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:58.777
Do I get a grit point
back for that, or no?

00:32:58.777 --> 00:33:00.105
MATT: Uh, yeah, I'll say.

00:33:00.105 --> 00:33:02.985
The next time I hit a
creature with a ranged weapon,

00:33:02.985 --> 00:33:04.152
I rolled a 27.

00:33:07.555 --> 00:33:11.311
Yeah, so right now, you're
aiming at them all in the hole.

00:33:11.311 --> 00:33:12.508
From your perspective, they're gonna

00:33:12.508 --> 00:33:14.066
have three-quarters cover.

00:33:14.066 --> 00:33:14.899
So that--

00:33:14.899 --> 00:33:17.957
I just need to hit the one
that's closest to the top.

00:33:17.957 --> 00:33:20.156
Right, what's your total roll on that?

00:33:20.156 --> 00:33:21.147
27.

00:33:21.147 --> 00:33:21.980
27?

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.359
Yeah, even with the three-quarters
cover, that'll still hit.

00:33:25.359 --> 00:33:26.192
Okay.

00:33:26.192 --> 00:33:28.631
So go ahead and roll damage on that.

00:33:28.631 --> 00:33:30.266
Is everyone still standing, by the way?

00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:31.257
No.

00:33:31.257 --> 00:33:32.750
Both the ones that were
standing got pushed

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.885
into the hole by gun blasts from behind.

00:33:34.885 --> 00:33:39.027
Shoved into the large,
open chasm beneath them.

00:33:39.027 --> 00:33:40.696
26 damage.

00:33:40.696 --> 00:33:42.320
MATT: 26 damage?

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.805
Casting this at what level?

00:33:43.805 --> 00:33:44.638
Level three.

00:33:44.638 --> 00:33:45.645
At level three?

00:33:45.645 --> 00:33:46.478
Nice.

00:33:48.125 --> 00:33:48.958
All right.

00:33:48.958 --> 00:33:50.039
Each creature within
five feet of it?

00:33:50.039 --> 00:33:53.616
Okay, so it's, at five feet,
the hole's a much bigger space,

00:33:53.616 --> 00:33:55.145
so it only hits two of them.

00:33:55.145 --> 00:33:55.978
Okay.

00:33:55.978 --> 00:33:58.872
I'll fling a dagger at the
last one once you're done.

00:33:58.872 --> 00:33:59.752
Okay.

00:33:59.752 --> 00:34:01.180
So, this is all happening simultaneously.

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.884
(mimics battle sounds)

00:34:02.884 --> 00:34:03.717
Daggers.

00:34:03.717 --> 00:34:04.922
(laughing)

00:34:04.922 --> 00:34:07.046
So, it blasts two of them,
they both catch themselves--

00:34:07.046 --> 00:34:07.899
Oh, wait!

00:34:07.899 --> 00:34:09.283
That was sneak attack.

00:34:09.283 --> 00:34:11.598
MATT: Yes, so you
would actually get to...

00:34:11.598 --> 00:34:12.431
Add another six?

00:34:12.431 --> 00:34:13.384
MATT: Yeah.

00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:15.425
LAURA: Six!
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:34:15.425 --> 00:34:17.554
All right, that will make them...

00:34:17.554 --> 00:34:18.387
Not too happy.

00:34:18.387 --> 00:34:19.554
And your turn?

00:34:20.882 --> 00:34:23.103
All right, throwing one dagger.

00:34:23.103 --> 00:34:25.311
Okay, and it's advantage in hiding...

00:34:25.311 --> 00:34:26.978
And it is 27 to hit.

00:34:28.284 --> 00:34:30.058
That hits, even with the cover.

00:34:30.058 --> 00:34:30.929
And it's...

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:35.330
A sneak attack, and a surprise,
so it's a crit, right?

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:37.023
'Cause I'm hidden underneath shit.

00:34:37.023 --> 00:34:38.174
'Cause she hid us.

00:34:38.174 --> 00:34:39.077
LAURA: Hide in plain sight.

00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:40.409
Technically...

00:34:40.559 --> 00:34:43.129
Yeah, I'll let it happen, 'cause it's
part of the surprise round,

00:34:43.129 --> 00:34:44.303
we'll say this is all 
happening simultaneously.

00:34:44.303 --> 00:34:47.687
They fall in, grasp, then
they catch themselves,

00:34:47.687 --> 00:34:48.931
and then the blade comes out of nowhere.

00:34:48.931 --> 00:34:51.431
So yeah, I'll let that happen.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:53.597
18, 19...

00:34:55.737 --> 00:34:57.655
MARISHA: I know, all the dice.

00:34:59.393 --> 00:35:00.765
21, 34...

00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:04.182
34 turns to 68, plus the bonus is 70, 74.

00:35:08.154 --> 00:35:10.094
TALIESIN: That's obscene.

00:35:10.094 --> 00:35:12.377
With that, the blade sinks into

00:35:12.377 --> 00:35:15.129
the top of the skull of the one.

00:35:15.129 --> 00:35:16.422
The Goliath's trying to pull himself out.

00:35:16.422 --> 00:35:19.288
As it hits, his arms just go
limp and he falls backward

00:35:19.288 --> 00:35:21.277
and disappears beneath the earth.

00:35:21.277 --> 00:35:24.093
And just in case, I'm using
my bonus action to hide.

00:35:24.093 --> 00:35:25.845
(laughing)

00:35:25.845 --> 00:35:27.850
LAURA: Oh shit, I should've done that!

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:28.850
MATT: Go ahead and roll stealth.

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:31.759
TALIESIN: None goth'er than thou.

00:35:31.759 --> 00:35:33.129
LIAM: 25.

00:35:33.129 --> 00:35:34.183
MATT: 25?

00:35:34.183 --> 00:35:35.731
Okay, good enough.

00:35:35.731 --> 00:35:36.564
All right--

00:35:36.564 --> 00:35:37.812
Could I do the same thing,
because I forgot to hide,

00:35:37.812 --> 00:35:39.687
for my bonus action as well?

00:35:39.687 --> 00:35:40.520
MATT: Sure.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.353
Okay.

00:35:41.353 --> 00:35:43.103
Both of them just--

00:35:43.952 --> 00:35:44.846
(laughing)

00:35:44.846 --> 00:35:45.679
LAURA: 30.

00:35:45.679 --> 00:35:47.043
MATT: 30, okay.

00:35:47.043 --> 00:35:47.876
You got 10?

00:35:47.876 --> 00:35:49.341
No, I didn't.

00:35:49.341 --> 00:35:50.174
Way higher.

00:35:50.174 --> 00:35:53.623
So as it stands now, there are...

00:35:53.623 --> 00:35:54.623
I believe...

00:35:56.793 --> 00:35:58.256
Two more in there that
are currently holding on

00:35:58.256 --> 00:36:01.442
to try and find their way up.

00:36:01.442 --> 00:36:02.567
As this is happening, Keyleth,

00:36:02.567 --> 00:36:05.826
you're paying attention,
you hear this high-pitched

00:36:05.826 --> 00:36:06.932
(screech).

00:36:06.932 --> 00:36:08.345
You look over your shoulder
just in time to see

00:36:08.345 --> 00:36:11.140
a large giant eagle swoop down,

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:14.380
talons extended towards you,
visible on the top of the wall.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.862
There's no way I could use my

00:36:15.862 --> 00:36:17.489
third shot really quick, is there?

00:36:17.489 --> 00:36:20.223
Uh, no, you're too focused
on the thing in front you.

00:36:20.223 --> 00:36:22.338
TRAVIS: (singing) Let the eagle soar!

00:36:22.338 --> 00:36:23.892
It swoops down and the talon strikes you,

00:36:23.892 --> 00:36:25.229
the talon's pushing you forward,

00:36:25.229 --> 00:36:27.625
that is gonna be a...

00:36:27.625 --> 00:36:28.688
20?

00:36:28.688 --> 00:36:29.521
Your AC?

00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:30.354
Yeah, that hits.

00:36:30.354 --> 00:36:31.354
All right.

00:36:32.394 --> 00:36:34.971
You suffer nine points of piercing damage

00:36:34.971 --> 00:36:37.640
as its claws dig into you and attempt

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.996
to throw you from the top of the wall.

00:36:39.996 --> 00:36:41.091
MARISHA: Okay, bring it.

00:36:41.091 --> 00:36:45.314
Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw

00:36:45.314 --> 00:36:48.910
to try and grab the
ledge before you plummet.

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:50.832
That's not great.

00:36:50.832 --> 00:36:51.665
Uh, 11.

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:54.807
Unfortunately, you don't
even know which way is up

00:36:54.807 --> 00:36:56.371
as the talons chuck you forth

00:36:56.371 --> 00:36:57.618
and you plummet from the top of the wall.

00:36:57.618 --> 00:37:00.487
You fall down a total of 45 feet.

00:37:00.487 --> 00:37:01.769
Can I go, like,

00:37:01.769 --> 00:37:04.804
Can I turn back into a raven as I fall?

00:37:04.804 --> 00:37:07.056
My other bonus, my other action?

00:37:07.056 --> 00:37:08.648
Yeah.

00:37:08.648 --> 00:37:13.371
I'll say go ahead, make a
constitution saving throw

00:37:13.371 --> 00:37:14.638
as part of your concentration check,

00:37:14.638 --> 00:37:16.406
just to see if you're
able to focus your mind

00:37:16.406 --> 00:37:18.674
in that quick period of time.

00:37:18.674 --> 00:37:20.105
Uh, 19.

00:37:20.105 --> 00:37:21.062
19, yeah!

00:37:21.062 --> 00:37:21.895
(applause)

00:37:21.895 --> 00:37:23.088
As you're spiraling
backwards, seeing the eagle,

00:37:23.088 --> 00:37:25.416
you look behind you to the
ground, close your eyes,

00:37:25.416 --> 00:37:27.597
swoop upward into the form of a raven.

00:37:27.597 --> 00:37:28.540
LAURA: Awesome!

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:29.373
Great work.

00:37:29.373 --> 00:37:30.383
That was sick.
TALIESIN: Sail!

00:37:30.383 --> 00:37:31.234
Sail!

00:37:31.234 --> 00:37:33.484
(laughing)

00:37:35.754 --> 00:37:36.587
All right, you guys watch as

00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:39.287
the other two guys stand up, getting out,

00:37:39.287 --> 00:37:41.438
(grunts) and look about.

00:37:41.438 --> 00:37:42.395
You are now still standing out

00:37:42.395 --> 00:37:43.861
in the middle of a thoroughfare,

00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:45.036
you're hiding off behind the...

00:37:45.036 --> 00:37:48.036
One of the chunks of rubble and rock

00:37:49.241 --> 00:37:51.726
that permeate the outside
of the wall in places.

00:37:51.726 --> 00:37:54.111
You guys are still hidden.

00:37:54.262 --> 00:37:56.501
MARISHA: Since I'm a raven now, can I do

00:37:56.501 --> 00:37:58.514
a loop back to the center of town

00:37:58.514 --> 00:37:59.956
and see what's going on?

00:37:59.956 --> 00:38:00.789
Yep.

00:38:00.789 --> 00:38:02.056
So you're heading back
to the center of town,

00:38:02.056 --> 00:38:03.518
it's gonna take you a
little bit to get there.

00:38:03.518 --> 00:38:04.351
Yep.

00:38:04.351 --> 00:38:05.848
They get back up to the top.

00:38:05.848 --> 00:38:07.668
They spend most of their
turn getting to that edge,

00:38:07.668 --> 00:38:09.558
and taking a few steps away from it,

00:38:09.558 --> 00:38:11.486
getting their weapons out and
kind of glaring at each other

00:38:11.486 --> 00:38:12.319
and trying to figure out

00:38:12.319 --> 00:38:14.222
what the hell they can do right now

00:38:14.222 --> 00:38:16.110
as you start looming towards them.

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:19.550
I, unarmed, start walking towards them.

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:21.967
And I say, "Where is Kevdak?"

00:38:25.094 --> 00:38:27.024
MATT: Make a deception check.

00:38:27.024 --> 00:38:28.136
SAM: Oh, boy.

00:38:28.136 --> 00:38:29.553
Not his strength.

00:38:31.806 --> 00:38:33.160
13.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:33.994
13?

00:38:33.994 --> 00:38:34.827
Plus...

00:38:37.091 --> 00:38:38.202
(laughing)

00:38:38.202 --> 00:38:39.035
All right.

00:38:39.035 --> 00:38:39.868
As you say that...

00:38:39.868 --> 00:38:43.240
One of the two individuals
has pulled their way out.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.157
Humanoid, kind of a grizzled beard.

00:38:48.709 --> 00:38:50.012
Their eyes kind of go wide, and he

00:38:50.012 --> 00:38:52.199
just stands still for a second.

00:38:52.199 --> 00:38:53.700
The other one is a Goliath who,

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.656
as he approaches, you
get a familiarity with,

00:38:56.656 --> 00:38:59.038
you remember this individual.

00:38:59.038 --> 00:39:01.083
Little younger than you.

00:39:01.083 --> 00:39:03.852
Has a pretty, pretty heavy scar
from the bottom of the chin

00:39:03.852 --> 00:39:05.842
that goes down to about the sternum.

00:39:05.842 --> 00:39:08.259
Named by, by the name of Suda

00:39:09.334 --> 00:39:10.717
who just kind of steps forward,

00:39:10.717 --> 00:39:13.547
gives you a look-over and goes,

00:39:13.547 --> 00:39:14.797
"Strongjaw, ha.

00:39:16.647 --> 00:39:20.245
"You're a Grog stronger,
that's what you are."

00:39:20.245 --> 00:39:22.245
Fool. You know not who I am.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:28.093
I have not come through flame and death

00:39:28.093 --> 00:39:30.118
to deal with filth like you.

00:39:31.418 --> 00:39:33.118
"He's a bleedin' liar."

00:39:33.118 --> 00:39:35.585
"Come on, you guys have been had."

00:39:35.585 --> 00:39:37.211
And he goes ahead and
takes the two hand axes,

00:39:37.211 --> 00:39:38.971
he throws them in the air
and kinda catches them.

00:39:38.971 --> 00:39:43.392
He goes (grunts) and
rushes in towards you.

00:39:43.392 --> 00:39:45.615
However, he's unable to
make anything else this turn

00:39:45.615 --> 00:39:48.231
except movement into
face-to-face with Grog.

00:39:48.231 --> 00:39:50.136
We'll say, for the purposes
of this open space,

00:39:50.136 --> 00:39:52.969
Grog will be there and this one...

00:39:55.465 --> 00:39:56.501
SAM: Suda.

00:39:56.501 --> 00:39:57.334
TRAVIS: Suda.

00:39:58.537 --> 00:39:59.370
He's gonna...

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:00.264
Not quite as--

00:40:00.264 --> 00:40:01.097
LAURA: Tiny.

00:40:01.097 --> 00:40:02.238
That blade there.

00:40:02.238 --> 00:40:03.684
LAURA: He's pathetic.

00:40:03.684 --> 00:40:04.695
Look at that loser.

00:40:04.695 --> 00:40:05.897
(laughing)

00:40:05.897 --> 00:40:06.730
Kill him, Grog!

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:07.819
Kill him, Grog!

00:40:07.819 --> 00:40:09.265
MATT: Is anybody else doing anything

00:40:09.265 --> 00:40:10.439
right now on this turn?

00:40:10.439 --> 00:40:12.091
Or are we just waiting
to see what happens here?

00:40:12.091 --> 00:40:13.444
TALIESIN: I'm observing.

00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:14.494
Okay.

00:40:14.494 --> 00:40:15.331
So.

00:40:15.331 --> 00:40:17.255
As you're watching and you're
heading off that direction,

00:40:17.255 --> 00:40:20.220
Grog, he comes forward, in
your face, what do you do?

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:23.275
I would like to rage.

00:40:23.275 --> 00:40:24.219
(laughing)

00:40:24.219 --> 00:40:25.165
MATT: All right.

00:40:25.165 --> 00:40:27.836
Take out the firebrand warhammer,

00:40:27.836 --> 00:40:29.460
and I'm gonna tattoo his ass.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.261
(laughing)

00:40:31.261 --> 00:40:32.637
Go for it, go ahead and take
your two attacks.

00:40:32.637 --> 00:40:35.377
(laughing)

00:40:36.587 --> 00:40:37.760
Uh, 16.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.267
MATT: 16?

00:40:39.267 --> 00:40:40.313
Misses.

00:40:40.313 --> 00:40:41.146
No!

00:40:41.146 --> 00:40:43.267
I cast War God's Blessing.

00:40:43.267 --> 00:40:44.458
(gasps)

00:40:44.458 --> 00:40:46.657
As Pike steps out from
the high grass, in this--

00:40:46.657 --> 00:40:47.823
ASHLEY: What up, motherfucker?

00:40:47.823 --> 00:40:48.991
Oh!

00:40:48.991 --> 00:40:50.192
(laughing)

00:40:50.192 --> 00:40:51.323
MARISHA: Pike is back!

00:40:51.323 --> 00:40:55.163
With that, the little bit of
noise distraction outside,

00:40:55.163 --> 00:40:57.461
turns his face, his eyes
peeking out the corner of

00:40:57.461 --> 00:41:01.394
the eye sockets, and that's
just the little moment

00:41:01.394 --> 00:41:03.657
of opportunity you need to go ahead

00:41:03.657 --> 00:41:06.711
and double up and slam upward
with the butt of the hammer.

00:41:06.711 --> 00:41:09.878
Go ahead, roll damage for that attack.

00:41:13.053 --> 00:41:16.970
TRAVIS: Oh God, it's been so
long since I used the...

00:41:19.403 --> 00:41:20.351
(laughing)

00:41:20.351 --> 00:41:21.862
Uh, that's 17.

00:41:21.862 --> 00:41:23.877
MATT: 17 damage, got it.

00:41:23.877 --> 00:41:24.710
Second attack?

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:26.596
Second attack

00:41:26.596 --> 00:41:27.429
is 24.

00:41:28.414 --> 00:41:30.131
That hits, roll damage
on that one as well.

00:41:30.131 --> 00:41:32.063
LIAM: Hey, where'd the grizzly guy go?

00:41:32.063 --> 00:41:33.758
The grizzly guy's just
stepping back a little bit.

00:41:33.758 --> 00:41:35.711
Or like, he's like taking
one step onto his back foot,

00:41:35.711 --> 00:41:37.276
not even approaching Grog.

00:41:37.276 --> 00:41:38.965
Where's the eagles?

00:41:38.965 --> 00:41:41.557
The eagles aren't too far
from your side right now.

00:41:41.557 --> 00:41:43.732
SAM: And where's the pit?

00:41:43.732 --> 00:41:47.221
The pit is about 10 feet
behind the guy who's standing,

00:41:47.221 --> 00:41:49.803
actually, I should probably
put him there right now.

00:41:49.803 --> 00:41:50.636
TALIESIN: Also, I'd like to keep

00:41:50.636 --> 00:41:52.020
an eye out for the eagles as well.

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:53.391
MATT: He's about there.

00:41:53.391 --> 00:41:54.616
LIAM: And where's the chasm?

00:41:54.616 --> 00:41:56.801
LAURA: He's putting it
down, he's putting it down.

00:41:56.801 --> 00:41:57.880
LIAM: All right!

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.594
MATT: I'm doing this, I'm
drawing it out for you guys.

00:41:59.594 --> 00:42:00.877
Come on, invent a battle
map, just like that, Matt!

00:42:00.877 --> 00:42:02.505
Come on!

00:42:02.505 --> 00:42:04.755
(laughing)

00:42:06.432 --> 00:42:09.432
(adventurous music)

00:42:15.625 --> 00:42:16.834
TALIESIN: That is a really good chasm.

00:42:16.834 --> 00:42:17.897
LAURA: That is a huge chasm!

00:42:17.897 --> 00:42:21.964
We're watching his magic in real life.

00:42:21.964 --> 00:42:24.226
Where's all the dead
bodies at the bottom of it?

00:42:24.226 --> 00:42:25.729
Yeah, can you draw detailed dead bodies?

00:42:25.729 --> 00:42:26.743
(laughing)

00:42:26.743 --> 00:42:27.701
Can you just grade it a little bit?

00:42:27.701 --> 00:42:29.534
MATT: Oh, I'm dead!

00:42:33.188 --> 00:42:35.400
SAM: Do you like to draw,
or sketch, or just doodle?

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.994
LIAM: Where are the twins right now?

00:42:36.994 --> 00:42:38.745
Twins would be back here.

00:42:38.745 --> 00:42:40.572
LAURA: Hiding.

00:42:40.572 --> 00:42:43.068
Pike would be off to the side here.

00:42:43.068 --> 00:42:44.106
TALIESIN: Way off in the middle of fuck-all.

00:42:44.106 --> 00:42:45.981
Percy's like (babbling)

00:42:45.981 --> 00:42:46.814
TALIESIN: I'm gonna keep an eye out

00:42:46.814 --> 00:42:48.247
for the eagles, too, so...

00:42:48.247 --> 00:42:49.080
MATT: Okay.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.590
Everybody keep commenting
if you see something--

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:51.423
Where's the eagles?

00:42:51.423 --> 00:42:52.724
TRAVIS: So the last attack was 18,

00:42:52.724 --> 00:42:55.253
plus 2 points of the fire damage, for 20.

00:42:55.253 --> 00:42:56.877
For 20, nice.

00:42:56.877 --> 00:42:57.717
TRAVIS: The second attack.

00:42:57.717 --> 00:42:58.784
Okay.

00:42:58.784 --> 00:43:00.171
So that ends your turn.

00:43:00.171 --> 00:43:01.593
He's gonna go ahead and go for

00:43:01.593 --> 00:43:03.660
a round of retaliation against you,

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:07.975
using the action surge
that was afforded by it,

00:43:07.975 --> 00:43:10.768
gonna make 4 attacks on you.

00:43:10.768 --> 00:43:13.685
That is a really, really shitty 16.

00:43:14.824 --> 00:43:15.657
TRAVIS: Misses.

00:43:15.657 --> 00:43:16.568
Misses.

00:43:16.568 --> 00:43:17.651
That is a 24.

00:43:18.494 --> 00:43:19.941
TRAVIS: Hits.

00:43:19.941 --> 00:43:21.023
MATT: That is 25.

00:43:21.023 --> 00:43:21.856
Hits.

00:43:21.856 --> 00:43:23.048
MATT: And a 22.

00:43:23.048 --> 00:43:23.881
That also hits.

00:43:23.881 --> 00:43:26.083
So three hits on you.

00:43:26.083 --> 00:43:27.694
LAURA: He's strong!

00:43:27.694 --> 00:43:30.220
MARISHA: How does he get four attacks?

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:31.299
Is he a fighter?

00:43:31.299 --> 00:43:32.132
TALIESIN: Action surge.

00:43:32.132 --> 00:43:32.965
Oh, action surge?

00:43:32.965 --> 00:43:33.901
(groans)

00:43:33.901 --> 00:43:38.121
So this would be 11
points of slashing damage,

00:43:38.121 --> 00:43:39.371
reduced to six.

00:43:40.941 --> 00:43:42.765
Or five, actually, for you.

00:43:42.765 --> 00:43:44.303
That is...

00:43:44.303 --> 00:43:46.653
14 points slashing damage reduced to 7.

00:43:46.653 --> 00:43:47.572
Okay.

00:43:47.572 --> 00:43:50.448
MATT: And 9 reduced to 4.

00:43:50.448 --> 00:43:51.281
Okay.

00:43:52.235 --> 00:43:53.112
He just hacks into you

00:43:53.112 --> 00:43:55.195
(grunts)

00:43:56.815 --> 00:43:57.683
and looks forward and sees you

00:43:57.683 --> 00:44:00.567
barely moved by this flurry.

00:44:00.567 --> 00:44:02.673
TRAVIS: Oh tiny dancer, you are fucked.

00:44:02.673 --> 00:44:05.050
(laughing)

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:06.096
MATT: Anyone else jumping in on this?

00:44:06.096 --> 00:44:07.065
Yeah, can I do a thing?

00:44:07.065 --> 00:44:10.117
I want to stealth and creep
over to where Pike is.

00:44:10.117 --> 00:44:11.173
MATT: Okay.

00:44:11.173 --> 00:44:13.087
You've been stealth, but yeah--

00:44:13.087 --> 00:44:14.681
LIAM: And I would like to hold my action

00:44:14.681 --> 00:44:18.213
and if the Goliath's buddy does anything,

00:44:18.213 --> 00:44:19.941
if he tries to help or if he tries to run,

00:44:19.941 --> 00:44:21.844
I'm still hidden, right?

00:44:21.844 --> 00:44:22.677
Yeah.

00:44:22.677 --> 00:44:24.071
Yeah, so I'm gonna fucking throw a knife

00:44:24.071 --> 00:44:25.170
at him if he does anything.

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:26.168
MATT: Okay.

00:44:26.168 --> 00:44:27.705
I'm gonna cast Hunter's
Mark on the guy behind.

00:44:27.705 --> 00:44:29.555
MATT: Okay, got it.

00:44:29.555 --> 00:44:30.388
Keep one alive,

00:44:30.388 --> 00:44:32.302
I want to know where
our two principals are.

00:44:32.302 --> 00:44:33.135
Okay.

00:44:34.054 --> 00:44:35.499
TALIESIN: "Keep one alive."

00:44:35.499 --> 00:44:36.332
MATT: All right.

00:44:36.332 --> 00:44:38.639
Hunter's Mark on that fellow there.

00:44:38.639 --> 00:44:41.088
TALIESIN: And keeping an eye on the hawks.

00:44:41.088 --> 00:44:41.934
MATT: Okay.

00:44:41.934 --> 00:44:42.947
SAM: Eagle.

00:44:42.947 --> 00:44:44.718
You need one over there.

00:44:44.718 --> 00:44:46.141
Grog, your round of retribution is up.

00:44:46.141 --> 00:44:47.705
Pike, you wanna do anything?

00:44:47.705 --> 00:44:48.538
Uh...

00:44:51.274 --> 00:44:52.581
No, I'm gonna hold.

00:44:52.581 --> 00:44:54.032
MATT: Okay.

00:44:54.032 --> 00:44:55.831
Oh, it's my turn again?

00:44:55.831 --> 00:44:56.664
MATT: Yep.

00:44:56.664 --> 00:44:57.497
Yep.

00:44:57.497 --> 00:45:01.047
More tattoos for twiddly-fuck, Suda.

00:45:01.047 --> 00:45:01.880
Wait.

00:45:03.284 --> 00:45:04.387
No.

00:45:04.387 --> 00:45:07.735
I want to bullrush Suda and
drive him back towards...

00:45:07.735 --> 00:45:08.652
MARISHA: Yes, yes!

00:45:08.652 --> 00:45:09.765
TRAVIS: The pit.

00:45:10.529 --> 00:45:12.404
LAURA: Yeah! Pit of despair!

00:45:12.404 --> 00:45:14.127
SAM: That is the correct answer.

00:45:14.127 --> 00:45:15.088
(laughing)

00:45:15.088 --> 00:45:16.403
LAURA: The pit of despair.

00:45:16.403 --> 00:45:17.236
Haven't bullrushed in a while, okay.

00:45:17.236 --> 00:45:19.702
Make sure, I forgot that was proper.

00:45:19.702 --> 00:45:23.202
(jumbled excited chatter)

00:45:24.177 --> 00:45:25.010
TRAVIS: It might be, I think

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:27.571
it's like 30 feet, I can't remember.

00:45:27.571 --> 00:45:28.961
Or maybe it's 20, I can't remember.

00:45:28.961 --> 00:45:32.414
It's a little less than that, we'll see.

00:45:32.414 --> 00:45:33.247
TRAVIS: Oh, is it?

00:45:33.247 --> 00:45:34.102
We'll see.

00:45:34.102 --> 00:45:35.956
At least you made it interesting.

00:45:35.956 --> 00:45:38.439
So shoving a creature, you can...

00:45:38.439 --> 00:45:39.356
Shove it...

00:45:40.329 --> 00:45:43.264
LAURA: 9700 feet, specifically.

00:45:43.264 --> 00:45:45.597
All of them, all the feet.

00:45:47.056 --> 00:45:48.625
SAM: Yeah, I mean, maybe it's 15 feet,

00:45:48.625 --> 00:45:50.311
but he doesn't know numbers, so...

00:45:50.311 --> 00:45:51.144
It's strength.

00:45:51.144 --> 00:45:52.522
Okay, it's strength athletics check

00:45:52.522 --> 00:45:55.248
contested by his athletics
or acrobatics.

00:45:55.248 --> 00:45:58.100
You push him five feet
away from you, or prone.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.933
MARISHA: Five feet?

00:46:00.811 --> 00:46:01.828
LAURA: Or prone, prone is good.

00:46:01.828 --> 00:46:02.958
ASHLEY: Prone, and then you could--

00:46:02.958 --> 00:46:05.196
TRAVIS: Drag him.
ASHLEY: Drag him.

00:46:05.196 --> 00:46:06.343
MATT: You could try and shove him out,

00:46:06.343 --> 00:46:08.514
you could grapple and
try to drag him with you.

00:46:08.514 --> 00:46:09.627
TRAVIS: I'd like to do that.

00:46:09.627 --> 00:46:10.486
MATT: Okay.

00:46:10.486 --> 00:46:11.319
(laughing)

00:46:11.319 --> 00:46:12.152
so go ahead and make an--

00:46:12.152 --> 00:46:12.985
Athletics check?

00:46:12.985 --> 00:46:15.758
Athletics check, yeah.

00:46:15.758 --> 00:46:17.112
MATT: That's when I roll a natural one.

00:46:17.112 --> 00:46:17.945
That would be when I do it.

00:46:17.945 --> 00:46:18.778
Brilliant.

00:46:18.778 --> 00:46:20.146
MATT: Of course.

00:46:20.146 --> 00:46:21.502
'Cause that was a 12.

00:46:21.502 --> 00:46:22.351
MATT: Okay.

00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:25.426
And with that, you bring the
hammer back, like you're gonna

00:46:25.426 --> 00:46:26.811
go ahead and slam it into his face,

00:46:26.811 --> 00:46:27.890
and instead you reach down by

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:32.683
underneath the ankle, and you
just flip him onto his back.

00:46:32.683 --> 00:46:34.824
As he's there, slammed onto the ground,

00:46:34.824 --> 00:46:36.896
the hard, kind of packed
dirt of the roadway

00:46:36.896 --> 00:46:38.619
that leads into the
western side of Westruun,

00:46:38.619 --> 00:46:40.779
are you gonna attempt to
go for a grapple, then?

00:46:40.779 --> 00:46:41.612
Yes.

00:46:41.612 --> 00:46:42.830
MATT: All righty.

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:46.469
As he is on the ground, I will go ahead

00:46:46.469 --> 00:46:48.192
and allow advantage on this attempt.

00:46:48.192 --> 00:46:50.377
So for your second strike on this,

00:46:50.377 --> 00:46:55.054
roll another athletics
check, with an advantage.

00:46:55.054 --> 00:46:57.337
Because he is on the ground.

00:46:57.337 --> 00:46:58.963
27.

00:46:58.963 --> 00:47:00.157
MATT: Yeah, no, you got him.

00:47:00.157 --> 00:47:01.677
(laughing)

00:47:01.677 --> 00:47:02.510
ASHLEY: Bye-bye!

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:06.299
MATT: So you can drag him
at half your movement speed.

00:47:06.299 --> 00:47:07.382
So 25 feet?

00:47:09.079 --> 00:47:10.350
MARISHA: Oh my god, yes.

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:11.183
Oh my god.

00:47:11.183 --> 00:47:12.147
Let's count.

00:47:12.147 --> 00:47:13.873
Let's count!

00:47:13.873 --> 00:47:17.166
MATT: So that's 5, 10, 15, 20, 25.

00:47:17.166 --> 00:47:19.176
(cheering)

00:47:19.176 --> 00:47:20.009
LAURA: Kick him, kick him!

00:47:20.009 --> 00:47:20.842
SAM: Oh, the tension and the drama!

00:47:20.842 --> 00:47:23.396
TALIESIN: You can let him
stand before the chasm.

00:47:23.396 --> 00:47:24.229
Just...

00:47:24.229 --> 00:47:26.037
MATT: Especially dragging him through--

00:47:26.037 --> 00:47:27.247
LIAM: This!

00:47:27.247 --> 00:47:28.197
Is!

00:47:28.197 --> 00:47:29.571
Westruun!
TRAVIS: Don't say it!

00:47:29.571 --> 00:47:30.716
(laughing)

00:47:30.716 --> 00:47:31.549
MATT: The other guy next to him,

00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:33.123
holding the hand axe,
is watching you drag him off

00:47:33.123 --> 00:47:34.106
and he's just like...

00:47:34.106 --> 00:47:35.076
(grunts)

00:47:35.076 --> 00:47:36.715
and unleashes a--

00:47:36.715 --> 00:47:37.836
MARISHA: Fucking asshole.

00:47:37.836 --> 00:47:38.813
LAURA: No!

00:47:38.813 --> 00:47:40.296
MARISHA: Yeah, go go go!

00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:42.279
LIAM: I call it, I go for it, and I'm hidden.

00:47:42.279 --> 00:47:44.732
I have advantage and all that shit.

00:47:44.732 --> 00:47:45.565
Oh!

00:47:45.565 --> 00:47:47.815
(laughing)

00:47:49.551 --> 00:47:51.033
LIAM: 28, 29...
LAURA: 29.

00:47:51.033 --> 00:47:52.205
MATT: 29 hits.

00:47:52.205 --> 00:47:53.038
29, yep.

00:47:53.038 --> 00:47:54.685
Okay, good one.

00:47:54.685 --> 00:47:56.326
LAURA: Oh my god, those are so many!

00:47:56.326 --> 00:47:58.176
5, 10, 15...

00:47:58.176 --> 00:48:00.300
ASHLEY: I'm gonna cast Sanctuary on Grog.

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:03.515
LIAM: 25, 25 doubled is 50.
LAURA: 50!

00:48:03.515 --> 00:48:04.974
56, 56.

00:48:04.974 --> 00:48:05.807
SAM: 56?

00:48:05.807 --> 00:48:08.182
MATT: And the bonus action?

00:48:08.182 --> 00:48:10.217
56, and I would like to use
my bonus action to hide.

00:48:10.217 --> 00:48:11.344
(laughing)

00:48:11.344 --> 00:48:12.177
MATT: All right...

00:48:12.177 --> 00:48:13.704
Okay, yeah.

00:48:13.704 --> 00:48:16.144
Usually, your bonus action, you've already

00:48:16.144 --> 00:48:17.628
used your turn to hold your action.

00:48:17.628 --> 00:48:18.461
LIAM: Okay.

00:48:18.461 --> 00:48:19.294
In theory.

00:48:19.294 --> 00:48:20.200
Whatever you want, whatever you want.

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.338
MATT: I'll say you're
not hidden right now.

00:48:21.338 --> 00:48:22.433
Usually it's, you have to...

00:48:22.433 --> 00:48:24.112
The bonus action is used on your turn,

00:48:24.112 --> 00:48:25.511
and the holding your action is kind of

00:48:25.511 --> 00:48:27.041
that one thing that keeps over, so...

00:48:27.041 --> 00:48:27.874
LIAM: Love it.

00:48:27.874 --> 00:48:30.472
MATT: But as he goes
forward, the dagger

00:48:30.472 --> 00:48:33.681
sinks right into his
sternum and he kind of...

00:48:33.681 --> 00:48:34.889
(grunts)

00:48:34.889 --> 00:48:37.798
and, still using his
momentum, goes forward.

00:48:37.798 --> 00:48:38.878
As you're dragging it, it's gonna go

00:48:38.878 --> 00:48:40.759
two strikes against you.

00:48:40.759 --> 00:48:41.592
Uh...

00:48:43.456 --> 00:48:44.617
13.

00:48:44.617 --> 00:48:45.450
TRAVIS: Misses.

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:46.484
MATT: And 15.

00:48:46.484 --> 00:48:47.484
Misses.

00:48:47.484 --> 00:48:49.530
Just both axes do strike and hit you,

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:51.736
but one of them hits the shoulder armor

00:48:51.736 --> 00:48:53.985
on the back of your shoulder,

00:48:53.985 --> 00:48:55.237
kind of cracks part of the bone

00:48:55.237 --> 00:48:56.679
and just streaks off the metal.

00:48:56.679 --> 00:48:57.987
The other one comes down and hits you

00:48:57.987 --> 00:49:00.009
in the back of the Belt of Dwarvenkind.

00:49:00.009 --> 00:49:01.982
You feel a little sink of pain

00:49:01.982 --> 00:49:03.318
as it kind of cuts through
some of the leather,

00:49:03.318 --> 00:49:05.921
but even the belt itself
deflects most of the attack.

00:49:05.921 --> 00:49:06.754
TRAVIS: I look over and say,

00:49:06.754 --> 00:49:08.796
"Sit down, son, before you hurt yourself."

00:49:08.796 --> 00:49:11.292
(laughing)

00:49:11.292 --> 00:49:12.125
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

00:49:12.125 --> 00:49:12.958
(laughing)

00:49:12.958 --> 00:49:14.041
LAURA: Oh.

00:49:15.411 --> 00:49:16.244
TRAVIS: It's a 1.

00:49:16.244 --> 00:49:17.893
(laughing)

00:49:17.893 --> 00:49:18.750
MATT: He rolled a 20, so, yeah.

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:20.685
(laughing)

00:49:20.685 --> 00:49:22.149
He'd have a really witty comeback

00:49:22.149 --> 00:49:24.767
if he didn't have a dagger
in his sternum at the moment.

00:49:24.767 --> 00:49:25.600
MATT: Yeah.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.210
(laughing)

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:29.470
He's a little distracted at the moment.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.466
All right, so, that being said,

00:49:31.466 --> 00:49:33.429
the guy who's on the ground now--

00:49:33.429 --> 00:49:36.434
any of you guys wanna do
anything at this point?

00:49:36.434 --> 00:49:39.173
I'll shoot an arrow at the
other guy standing there.

00:49:39.173 --> 00:49:40.006
LIAM: Finish him off.

00:49:40.006 --> 00:49:43.296
MARISHA: Am I back to town yet?

00:49:43.296 --> 00:49:44.267
MATT: Not yet.

00:49:44.267 --> 00:49:45.047
This is--

00:49:45.047 --> 00:49:46.343
MARISHA: It takes a while.

00:49:46.343 --> 00:49:47.873
23?

00:49:47.873 --> 00:49:49.018
MATT: 23 it is.

00:49:49.018 --> 00:49:51.766
Roll damage, with Hunter's Mark.

00:49:51.766 --> 00:49:54.334
Hunter's Mark and sneak attack.

00:49:54.334 --> 00:49:55.427
MATT: Yes, because he cannot see you.

00:49:55.427 --> 00:49:56.427
He's unaware of your presence.

00:49:56.427 --> 00:49:58.536
TALIESIN: God, we're mean.

00:49:58.536 --> 00:49:59.801
LIAM: Efficient.

00:49:59.801 --> 00:50:01.594
TALIESIN: Efficient.

00:50:01.594 --> 00:50:02.774
21.

00:50:02.774 --> 00:50:03.607
MATT: All righty.

00:50:03.607 --> 00:50:04.694
That's the first arrow.

00:50:04.694 --> 00:50:06.527
MATT: All right.

00:50:07.915 --> 00:50:09.677
Oh, that was so close!

00:50:09.677 --> 00:50:10.867
14.

00:50:10.867 --> 00:50:12.194
14.

00:50:12.194 --> 00:50:13.027
It misses.

00:50:13.027 --> 00:50:13.860
It's okay, though,

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:15.034
I was going to let you
roll the second anyway.

00:50:15.034 --> 00:50:18.334
21, the arrow strikes him
right through the throat,

00:50:18.334 --> 00:50:21.216
and he just (gurgles and chokes)

00:50:21.216 --> 00:50:22.596
and grasps for his throat, gurgling

00:50:22.596 --> 00:50:24.866
before he falls to his knees and

00:50:24.866 --> 00:50:27.230
slumps into the ground, head to the side,

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:29.419
kind of still clutching
at it as he slowly,

00:50:29.419 --> 00:50:30.321
the life spills out of him.

00:50:30.321 --> 00:50:33.069
(laughing)

00:50:33.069 --> 00:50:35.300
LIAM: He died as he
lived, deeply unimpressed.

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.550
(laughing)

00:50:38.914 --> 00:50:41.581
The other guy gets up, though,

00:50:42.732 --> 00:50:46.018
and he's going to use action
trying to break the grapple.

00:50:46.018 --> 00:50:47.009
That is going to be a--

00:50:47.009 --> 00:50:48.160
LAURA: Fail!

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.040
Come on, Grog.

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.207
Come on, Grog!

00:50:51.989 --> 00:50:52.989
16.

00:50:52.989 --> 00:50:53.822
TRAVIS: Misses.

00:50:53.822 --> 00:50:55.115
(laughing)

00:50:55.115 --> 00:50:56.360
It's contested with your athletics.

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.193
Oh.

00:50:57.193 --> 00:50:58.358
And I have to roll an athletics check?

00:50:58.358 --> 00:50:59.191
MATT: Yeah.

00:50:59.191 --> 00:51:02.102
You are raging, so technically
you have advantage on it.

00:51:02.102 --> 00:51:04.284
That's pretty good.

00:51:04.284 --> 00:51:05.468
I'll take the 18.

00:51:05.468 --> 00:51:07.256
Athletics 26.

00:51:07.256 --> 00:51:09.667
Yeah, he's still grappling,
you can't do anything on that.

00:51:09.667 --> 00:51:10.957
It's your turn.
TALIESIN: He's wriggling!

00:51:10.957 --> 00:51:12.404
It's my turn?

00:51:12.404 --> 00:51:15.169
Well, I look to him and I say,

00:51:15.169 --> 00:51:18.746
"I will let you fly from here
if you answer this question.

00:51:18.746 --> 00:51:21.579
"Is Kevdak or Zanror in the city?"

00:51:24.572 --> 00:51:25.815
Make a persuasion check.

00:51:25.815 --> 00:51:26.648
No, this would be intimidation.

00:51:26.648 --> 00:51:28.351
Intimidation, not persuasion.

00:51:28.351 --> 00:51:31.629
This is how Goliaths prom dance.

00:51:31.629 --> 00:51:32.462
Uh, 8.

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:34.722
MATT: 8?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:51:34.722 --> 00:51:37.528
(laughing)

00:51:37.528 --> 00:51:40.405
Okay, as you're holding
him there, he goes,

00:51:40.405 --> 00:51:42.183
"You'll find out, won't you?"

00:51:42.183 --> 00:51:45.480
I take his neck and I smash
my head into his nose.

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:47.809
It just breaks and crumbles,

00:51:47.809 --> 00:51:49.574
his face is partially caved in,

00:51:49.574 --> 00:51:51.452
and you can see blood just running

00:51:51.452 --> 00:51:54.226
rapidly out of his nostrils
where his bones were.

00:51:54.226 --> 00:51:57.356
"You won't be there to watch my discovery.

00:51:57.356 --> 00:51:59.273
"Are they in the city?"

00:52:01.313 --> 00:52:03.822
"Yeah, they're waiting for you."

00:52:03.822 --> 00:52:06.092
"Good, I'll let you fly now."

00:52:06.092 --> 00:52:07.489
And I kick him into the pit.

00:52:07.489 --> 00:52:08.322
(laughing)

00:52:08.322 --> 00:52:09.572
MARISHA: Whee!

00:52:11.166 --> 00:52:12.353
All right, I'll say as you use

00:52:12.353 --> 00:52:13.895
your movement to push forward,

00:52:13.895 --> 00:52:17.228
go ahead and make your athletics check.

00:52:17.228 --> 00:52:18.061
18.

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:21.960
And with that, he--

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:24.300
(mimics fight sounds)

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:25.935
Reaching out, grasps, catches the

00:52:25.935 --> 00:52:27.864
very edge of the ledge behind him,

00:52:27.864 --> 00:52:29.301
and the rock just breaks.

00:52:29.301 --> 00:52:31.356
(laughing)

00:52:31.356 --> 00:52:32.871
"No!"

00:52:32.871 --> 00:52:34.620
He vanishes, screaming, into the pit below

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:36.021
as you step forward and look over.

00:52:36.021 --> 00:52:40.628
What little glint of daylight
even makes the bottom area,

00:52:40.628 --> 00:52:42.195
'cause it's far out of
your range for dark vision,

00:52:42.195 --> 00:52:45.929
you just see enough of a
movement on the bottom,

00:52:45.929 --> 00:52:47.938
and then no movement whatsoever.

00:52:47.938 --> 00:52:49.318
TALIESIN: You Wile E. Coyote'd that guy!

00:52:49.318 --> 00:52:50.151
Oh, man.

00:52:50.151 --> 00:52:52.210
GROG: You all right down there?

00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:54.500
(laughing)

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:55.500
No answer.

00:52:57.336 --> 00:52:58.199
Yay!

00:52:58.199 --> 00:52:59.032
Yay!

00:52:59.881 --> 00:53:01.086
LIAM: And scene.

00:53:01.086 --> 00:53:02.055
You've made it--

00:53:02.055 --> 00:53:03.997
I'm looking for Scanlan, too, by the way.

00:53:03.997 --> 00:53:04.830
Kind of keeping an eye out for Scanlan.

00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:06.413
Perception check.

00:53:08.828 --> 00:53:09.661
Uh, 23.

00:53:11.054 --> 00:53:11.971
23, okay.

00:53:12.825 --> 00:53:14.606
The second time.

00:53:14.606 --> 00:53:19.185
As you're glancing through,
you see no sign of Scanlan.

00:53:19.185 --> 00:53:21.018
You do see now that...

00:53:23.139 --> 00:53:27.139
There are small groups
of these clan individuals

00:53:29.563 --> 00:53:33.730
are now pulling out of homes
various denizens of Westruun

00:53:36.676 --> 00:53:39.629
and pulling them towards
the center of town.

00:53:39.629 --> 00:53:41.272
They're screaming and kicking, you know,

00:53:41.272 --> 00:53:42.365
or some of them just
aren't putting up a fight

00:53:42.365 --> 00:53:43.622
because they have no way to,

00:53:43.622 --> 00:53:45.833
and they're just pulling
them, almost like shields,

00:53:45.833 --> 00:53:47.666
to the center of town.

00:53:48.701 --> 00:53:51.119
It seems like they...

00:53:51.119 --> 00:53:52.412
MARISHA: Have a plan.
MATT: Have a plan.

00:53:52.412 --> 00:53:53.912
TALIESIN: Shit.

00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:57.383
I don't know that.

00:53:57.383 --> 00:53:58.883
I haul ass back.

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.090
Heading back.

00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:03.784
Do I see them, do I see the group?

00:54:03.784 --> 00:54:06.685
We've cleared the area,
more or less, yeah?

00:54:06.685 --> 00:54:08.823
MATT: I mean, the area where they
are, as you glance back?

00:54:08.823 --> 00:54:11.672
Yeah, there doesn't appear
to be any current set.

00:54:11.672 --> 00:54:13.010
Whoever was set to go to that side

00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:14.186
of the gate to check it out--

00:54:14.186 --> 00:54:15.019
MARISHA: Has been hit?

00:54:15.019 --> 00:54:15.852
Has not returned.

00:54:15.852 --> 00:54:16.860
MARISHA: Sure.

00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:19.360
Can I turn back into a crow,

00:54:20.278 --> 00:54:21.744
or do you need, do I need to--

00:54:21.744 --> 00:54:23.522
I have to cast that on you.

00:54:23.522 --> 00:54:25.937
But it's new casting, it's
not just the same casting?

00:54:25.937 --> 00:54:27.970
MARISHA: Correct.
TALIESIN: Okay, good.

00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:28.803
I can't drop it in and out.

00:54:28.803 --> 00:54:29.636
MATT: So you're heading back?

00:54:29.636 --> 00:54:30.469
I head back.

00:54:30.469 --> 00:54:31.302
Okay.

00:54:31.302 --> 00:54:32.135
Scanlan.

00:54:32.135 --> 00:54:33.119
Oh, me?

00:54:33.119 --> 00:54:34.545
MATT: Yes. So--
SAM: Oh, Jesus.

00:54:34.545 --> 00:54:36.270
As some time has passed,
you guys have waited it out.

00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:38.154
MARISHA: I'm looking for Scanlan

00:54:38.154 --> 00:54:39.290
on my way back, by the way.

00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:40.123
Yeah.

00:54:40.123 --> 00:54:43.005
You are currently hunkered down with

00:54:43.005 --> 00:54:47.172
Kaylee, Dr. Dranzel, and this
cluster of nine survivors.

00:54:48.512 --> 00:54:51.726
You've managed to parry off one incursion

00:54:51.726 --> 00:54:55.283
of these herd members within the temple.

00:54:55.283 --> 00:54:57.706
The barricaded door is
still slightly ajar,

00:54:57.706 --> 00:54:59.702
as closing it would make
quite a bit of noise.

00:54:59.702 --> 00:55:00.535
SAM: Mm-hmm.

00:55:00.535 --> 00:55:01.936
What are you planning to do?

00:55:01.936 --> 00:55:03.644
(sighs)

00:55:03.644 --> 00:55:04.477
I mean, I have to get these people

00:55:04.477 --> 00:55:06.560
out of the city, I guess.

00:55:09.727 --> 00:55:12.062
So, they know the location of the

00:55:12.062 --> 00:55:14.947
entrance to the sewers, correct?

00:55:14.947 --> 00:55:16.773
Kaylee had said that she knew, yeah.

00:55:16.773 --> 00:55:20.232
All right, well then, I'm just going to...

00:55:20.232 --> 00:55:21.065
Shit.

00:55:21.065 --> 00:55:22.630
Do I know that the Goliaths were

00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:25.213
working with orcs at all, or...

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:28.000
Was it just Goliaths, is it--

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:28.833
Well, no.

00:55:28.833 --> 00:55:30.399
From what you've heard from when...

00:55:30.399 --> 00:55:34.616
When Grog was interrogating
the first member

00:55:34.616 --> 00:55:36.289
of the herd that you guys found

00:55:36.289 --> 00:55:39.588
on your way south
through Westruun, there--

00:55:39.588 --> 00:55:42.466
it was a largely Goliath herd that had

00:55:42.466 --> 00:55:46.549
been challenged by and
then defeated another clan

00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:50.740
and then absorbed them, and the other clan

00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:53.468
involved a lot more varying
races and specialities.

00:55:53.468 --> 00:55:55.074
There were half-orcs, there were some

00:55:55.074 --> 00:55:57.037
kind of wild elves that
were part of the crew,

00:55:57.037 --> 00:55:59.040
and a lot of the brigand humans.

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.561
It was very much kind of like just--

00:56:00.561 --> 00:56:03.978
defeated their leader, took in the others

00:56:05.417 --> 00:56:07.155
because their choice was
to either die or join.

00:56:07.155 --> 00:56:07.988
SAM: Mm-hmm.

00:56:07.988 --> 00:56:09.756
And as such, it has
grown to this much more

00:56:09.756 --> 00:56:12.660
mammoth-sized roving herd.

00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:14.737
I don't remember the name of
that herd or anything, right?

00:56:14.737 --> 00:56:15.980
Or what they looked like.

00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:16.813
But they were motley,

00:56:16.813 --> 00:56:19.123
and they involved half-orcs and things.

00:56:19.123 --> 00:56:20.188
MATT: There were a couple half-orcs,

00:56:20.188 --> 00:56:21.722
there were a few humans that were, like,

00:56:21.722 --> 00:56:24.482
I think you saw one wild elf,
and then mostly Goliaths,

00:56:24.482 --> 00:56:27.033
based around the center
of the Margraves estate.

00:56:27.033 --> 00:56:28.392
Okay.

00:56:28.392 --> 00:56:29.966
All right.

00:56:29.966 --> 00:56:30.799
Uh, well, we're,

00:56:30.799 --> 00:56:32.762
I tell the people, there's
nine people, right?

00:56:32.762 --> 00:56:33.762
MATT: Yeah.

00:56:33.762 --> 00:56:34.805
Plus Me, Kaylee and Doctor?

00:56:34.805 --> 00:56:39.454
Uh, all right, well, I gather
the people around and I say,

00:56:39.454 --> 00:56:43.377
"We're going to be moving
through the city rather fast.

00:56:43.377 --> 00:56:46.266
"In case we are spotted, I need to

00:56:46.266 --> 00:56:47.948
"hide you people, or make you not

00:56:47.948 --> 00:56:51.531
"a target, so I'm going
to disguise you all

00:56:53.908 --> 00:56:56.658
"as a band of irritable half-orcs

00:56:58.152 --> 00:57:02.235
"and grotesque humans and
the like using Seeming.

00:57:05.077 --> 00:57:06.986
"And just look ornery, and look mean,

00:57:06.986 --> 00:57:10.030
"and if you are approached, just sort of

00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:13.313
"spit and kick the dirt and look pissy.

00:57:13.313 --> 00:57:14.162
"We'll go."

00:57:14.162 --> 00:57:16.337
Make a performance check.

00:57:16.337 --> 00:57:17.170
A performance check?

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:19.675
In showing them and guiding them--

00:57:19.675 --> 00:57:22.312
Oh, I can demonstrate it for them.

00:57:22.312 --> 00:57:24.698
Yes, with my acting abilities.

00:57:24.698 --> 00:57:25.612
(laughing)

00:57:25.612 --> 00:57:26.920
Okay, I'm such a good performer.

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:28.919
I'm not even gonna look.

00:57:28.919 --> 00:57:30.236
Taliesin, what did I roll?

00:57:30.236 --> 00:57:33.069
Um, well, uh, you're doing okay.

00:57:33.999 --> 00:57:35.274
It's okay, you--

00:57:35.274 --> 00:57:37.978
with your performance bonus, that's a 20.

00:57:37.978 --> 00:57:38.811
Okay, good.

00:57:38.811 --> 00:57:40.310
(laughing)

00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:41.508
You take a moment to show, like,

00:57:41.508 --> 00:57:44.071
some guttural snarls, teach a few odd,

00:57:44.071 --> 00:57:46.245
you know, curse words in orcish

00:57:46.245 --> 00:57:48.050
that you learned through your travels.

00:57:48.050 --> 00:57:49.606
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just
some vocal warm-ups,

00:57:49.606 --> 00:57:51.253
you know, when you wanna get deep,

00:57:51.253 --> 00:57:53.956
(growls) everyone try.

00:57:53.956 --> 00:57:55.750
(growls)

00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:56.835
That's good, that's good, that's good.

00:57:56.835 --> 00:57:58.474
Work on that.

00:57:58.474 --> 00:58:01.981
You all gather up, along
with Dranzel and Kaylee,

00:58:01.981 --> 00:58:04.427
who looks kind of suspicious
at what you're attempting,

00:58:04.427 --> 00:58:07.003
she's like, "What exactly
are you trying to do here?"

00:58:07.003 --> 00:58:08.319
I'm just trying to keep us safe

00:58:08.319 --> 00:58:10.108
and get these people to the sewers.

00:58:10.108 --> 00:58:12.807
You know the way out
of the city, don't you?

00:58:12.807 --> 00:58:13.727
"Aye, I can show you."

00:58:13.727 --> 00:58:14.560
All right.

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:18.521
Do you have weapons, can
you protect yourself?

00:58:18.521 --> 00:58:19.551
Are you okay?

00:58:19.551 --> 00:58:21.395
"I can protect myself.

00:58:21.395 --> 00:58:23.899
"Don't worry, Scanlan."

00:58:23.899 --> 00:58:27.584
I'm just worried, I
have to worry about you,

00:58:27.584 --> 00:58:29.902
I will always be worried about you.

00:58:29.902 --> 00:58:30.748
I'm sorry.

00:58:30.748 --> 00:58:31.835
"You'll always be disappointed to find

00:58:31.835 --> 00:58:34.389
"that I can take care of myself."

00:58:34.389 --> 00:58:36.132
No, I won't be disappointed at all.

00:58:36.132 --> 00:58:38.242
In fact, that makes me quite happy.

00:58:38.242 --> 00:58:39.716
"Good, can we be off then?"

00:58:39.716 --> 00:58:41.126
Well, all right.

00:58:41.126 --> 00:58:43.922
Okay, as long as you're happy, I'm happy.

00:58:43.922 --> 00:58:45.258
"All right."

00:58:45.258 --> 00:58:46.488
Listen, I'm sorry, it's just--

00:58:46.488 --> 00:58:48.150
(laughing)

00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:49.148
I never get to see you, and

00:58:49.148 --> 00:58:52.550
I know we're in a rush
here and everything.

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:56.164
You can't, listen, you can't hate away

00:58:56.164 --> 00:58:58.058
me being your father, all right?

00:58:58.058 --> 00:58:59.872
I will always be the guy, no matter

00:58:59.872 --> 00:59:02.021
how much you curse my name and wish I was

00:59:02.021 --> 00:59:05.472
not part of you, my
blood is inside of you--

00:59:05.472 --> 00:59:06.305
LAURA: Ew.

00:59:06.305 --> 00:59:07.850
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, people,

00:59:07.850 --> 00:59:10.099
but, you know, I care about you.

00:59:10.099 --> 00:59:10.932
All right?

00:59:13.271 --> 00:59:15.626
"All right, it's not going to stop me from

00:59:15.626 --> 00:59:18.327
"trying to hate you away, but...

00:59:18.327 --> 00:59:19.683
"I get what you're saying.

00:59:19.683 --> 00:59:21.300
"Well, do your trick."

00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:22.133
Okay.

00:59:22.133 --> 00:59:23.845
So I cast Seeming on the lot, and

00:59:23.845 --> 00:59:26.110
I make a few orcs and a few humans.

00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:28.645
Any number of creatures
within 30 feet of you.

00:59:28.645 --> 00:59:31.895
So, all of these Westruun peasant folk,

00:59:33.274 --> 00:59:36.695
yourself, Dr. Dranzel, and Kaylee

00:59:36.695 --> 00:59:40.862
all of a sudden become,
to varying sized degrees--

00:59:43.633 --> 00:59:44.930
I can make people a foot taller.

00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:47.271
Taller, yeah, so like, they
can be somewhat larger.

00:59:47.271 --> 00:59:48.421
You're still--

00:59:48.421 --> 00:59:51.680
You guys are still tiny
little goblinoid half-orcs

00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:53.449
but it gives a visual perspective,

00:59:53.449 --> 00:59:54.886
based on what you've seen of this troop,

00:59:54.886 --> 00:59:56.293
and everyone kind of looks at themselves,

00:59:56.293 --> 00:59:57.744
looking at the back of their hands.

00:59:57.744 --> 00:59:59.626
There's this one kind of younger man

00:59:59.626 --> 01:00:03.187
in his mid-teens, he's
like, "This is amazing!"

01:00:03.187 --> 01:00:04.020
(grunts)

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:06.373
And they're also making
the noises at each other,

01:00:06.373 --> 01:00:07.860
like for a brief moment, all of the fear

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:09.382
subsides as they're, for the moment,

01:00:09.382 --> 01:00:11.342
getting into the play of
acting like a half-orc,

01:00:11.342 --> 01:00:12.341
and then they all get serious again

01:00:12.341 --> 01:00:14.138
and look to you and
Kaylee and Kaylee goes,

01:00:14.138 --> 01:00:16.471
"All right then, follow me."

01:00:18.626 --> 01:00:20.309
SAM: She's so good!

01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:24.476
Slinks out the door, looks
back and forth for a moment.

01:00:26.396 --> 01:00:27.229
Leans back in.

01:00:27.229 --> 01:00:28.723
"Coast is clear."

01:00:28.723 --> 01:00:29.556
She nods.

01:00:29.556 --> 01:00:31.426
You see a troop of about...

01:00:31.426 --> 01:00:34.926
It would be 12 half-orc looking barbarians

01:00:40.415 --> 01:00:43.359
of varying aggressive stances

01:00:43.359 --> 01:00:48.107
start pouring out of a broken
temple and into the street.

01:00:48.107 --> 01:00:50.883
I swoop down a little closer.

01:00:50.883 --> 01:00:52.120
MATT: They're heading--
SAM: And attack us!

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.609
(laughing)

01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:54.442
MATT: I'm waiting to see!

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:55.275
Tippi Hedren.

01:00:55.275 --> 01:00:56.550
Caw!

01:00:56.550 --> 01:00:57.430
Her elemental drop...

01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:58.435
(laughing)

01:00:58.435 --> 01:00:59.268
Super!

01:01:00.641 --> 01:01:02.308
Tails in the hole!

01:01:04.933 --> 01:01:07.042
Can I tell them it's Scanlan and crew?

01:01:07.042 --> 01:01:07.875
No.

01:01:07.875 --> 01:01:08.708
You have no idea.

01:01:08.708 --> 01:01:10.176
It's very believable.

01:01:10.176 --> 01:01:11.096
It's very believable.

01:01:11.096 --> 01:01:12.421
And you see this roving
band of half-orcs now

01:01:12.421 --> 01:01:14.862
that are heading southward
of the town in a cluster.

01:01:14.862 --> 01:01:15.819
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: They're like,

01:01:15.819 --> 01:01:17.008
jumping from one alleyway to another,

01:01:17.008 --> 01:01:19.137
and they're heading kind of southwest.

01:01:19.137 --> 01:01:23.664
Am I like, "This is sporadic
for a group of orcs,"

01:01:23.664 --> 01:01:26.291
or am I like, "Crazy
fuckin' group of orcs!"

01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:27.203
Make an insight check.

01:01:27.203 --> 01:01:28.203
All right.

01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:29.973
Yeah, it'll work--

01:01:29.973 --> 01:01:32.155
I'm taking it back, I'm taking it back!

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:34.510
Ooh, that was better, that was better!

01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:35.343
I felt bad.

01:01:35.343 --> 01:01:36.176
(laughing)

01:01:36.176 --> 01:01:38.521
ASHLEY: She bailed on her roll-

01:01:38.521 --> 01:01:39.354
No!

01:01:40.699 --> 01:01:41.532
(laughing)

01:01:41.532 --> 01:01:42.702
I didn't trust it, it was in the air.

01:01:42.702 --> 01:01:43.592
26.

01:01:43.592 --> 01:01:44.880
26.

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.948
Something is off about this troop,

01:01:45.948 --> 01:01:48.209
but you're uncertain what it is.

01:01:48.209 --> 01:01:49.042
Okay.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:50.873
All right.

01:01:52.541 --> 01:01:53.811
MATT: All right, you
guys continue to move--

01:01:53.811 --> 01:01:56.083
SAM: Continue to move, as fast as possible.

01:01:56.083 --> 01:01:59.056
You move southward past
one sequence of alleys

01:01:59.056 --> 01:02:01.737
to the next street, south,
and Kaylee continues

01:02:01.737 --> 01:02:05.070
to usher up to the edge of the alleyway.

01:02:05.932 --> 01:02:08.015
She looks back and forth.

01:02:09.479 --> 01:02:12.744
Nods, and you guys walk
into the street again.

01:02:12.744 --> 01:02:15.991
As you step into the
street, a voice goes, "Hey!"

01:02:15.991 --> 01:02:18.169
And Kaylee stops and whips around and

01:02:18.169 --> 01:02:20.802
looks in that direction, and you can see

01:02:20.802 --> 01:02:23.450
a group of three individuals,
led by one Goliath

01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:25.595
and there is one kind of wild-looking elf

01:02:25.595 --> 01:02:27.134
who has, like, face-paint strewn across

01:02:27.134 --> 01:02:28.710
the front of their expression, with this

01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:31.892
long, almost dredlocked, light brown hair,

01:02:31.892 --> 01:02:34.817
and what looks to be an older human

01:02:34.817 --> 01:02:36.866
with, like, streaks of black and grey,

01:02:36.866 --> 01:02:39.901
and this long, long beard that's
tied off near the stomach.

01:02:39.901 --> 01:02:42.517
Bare-chested, with, like,
scars across the chest

01:02:42.517 --> 01:02:44.591
and they all kind of loom
up as the Goliath steps up,

01:02:44.591 --> 01:02:48.726
pointing out, "We need
you to the west gate!"

01:02:48.726 --> 01:02:50.726
And he kind of steps up.

01:02:52.524 --> 01:02:54.274
"Who's your watcher?"

01:02:56.065 --> 01:03:00.232
I step forward and say, "He
was killed by that gnome."

01:03:01.572 --> 01:03:04.072
"Gnome? Where'd you see it?"

01:03:05.205 --> 01:03:06.446
"Right in the center of town.

01:03:06.446 --> 01:03:09.807
"He was a scary undead gnome,
and he's roaming about.

01:03:09.807 --> 01:03:12.245
"Kevdak sent us to search for him."

01:03:12.245 --> 01:03:13.499
Make a deception check.

01:03:13.499 --> 01:03:16.208
(groans)

01:03:16.208 --> 01:03:17.041
19.

01:03:18.206 --> 01:03:19.108
19!

01:03:19.108 --> 01:03:19.941
So ugly.

01:03:21.513 --> 01:03:23.263
"Center of town, aye?

01:03:26.181 --> 01:03:27.954
"Well then, you should
probably come with us, then.

01:03:27.954 --> 01:03:30.037
"See if we can swarm it."

01:03:32.733 --> 01:03:34.281
If I may, if I may actually,

01:03:34.281 --> 01:03:35.979
(laughing)

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:39.828
Kevdak said to follow the
gnome, and he ran this way.

01:03:39.828 --> 01:03:43.578
I'm sorry, we have to
follow Kevdak's orders.

01:03:46.702 --> 01:03:48.202
GROUP: Ooooh...

01:03:50.204 --> 01:03:51.037
All right, all right.

01:03:51.037 --> 01:03:51.870
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:52.703
(laughing)

01:03:52.703 --> 01:03:55.453
TALIESIN: Please, please, God!

01:03:56.613 --> 01:03:58.200
Make another deception
check with disadvantage.

01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.322
MARISHA: Oh, no!

01:03:59.322 --> 01:04:00.503
TRAVIS: Come on, baby.

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:01.546
LIAM: "Gotta get there before they

01:04:01.546 --> 01:04:03.796
"run out of cucumber sandwiches!"

01:04:03.796 --> 01:04:04.790
ASHLEY: Come on, come on.

01:04:04.790 --> 01:04:05.623
Same thing!

01:04:05.623 --> 01:04:07.122
19.

01:04:07.122 --> 01:04:11.098
He goes, "All right, we'll
send a few more men your way."

01:04:11.098 --> 01:04:11.931
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:12.814
"Stay on that trail!

01:04:12.814 --> 01:04:13.986
"If I see you again, and you ain't got

01:04:13.986 --> 01:04:15.270
"a dead gnome in your hands,

01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:17.528
"I'm gonna cut that head
from its shoulders."

01:04:17.528 --> 01:04:20.609
All right, you have my
word, we're gonna do--

01:04:20.609 --> 01:04:21.498
see ya later!

01:04:21.498 --> 01:04:23.748
(laughing)

01:04:24.603 --> 01:04:25.436
"Strange one

01:04:25.436 --> 01:04:26.269
"All right."

01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:29.044
And two of them head back as one of them

01:04:29.044 --> 01:04:31.455
just kind of keeps their
distance behind you guys,

01:04:31.455 --> 01:04:33.265
following you as you travel.

01:04:33.265 --> 01:04:36.215
You dart into the next alley.

01:04:36.215 --> 01:04:37.881
Kaylee's like " Come on, come on!"

01:04:37.881 --> 01:04:39.207
And as you guys duck into the shadows,

01:04:39.207 --> 01:04:41.109
everyone's pace quickens to the center

01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:42.906
of this alleyway, where there is...

01:04:42.906 --> 01:04:45.278
It seems like a large stack of

01:04:45.278 --> 01:04:47.598
partially emptied crates that contain,

01:04:47.598 --> 01:04:51.080
like, broken pieces of furniture,

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.322
it's essentially a small dump in the area.

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:57.202
Nothing food or, you know, refuse-wise,

01:04:57.202 --> 01:04:58.744
but there's definitely, like, this is a...

01:04:58.744 --> 01:05:01.494
A graveyard for broken furniture.

01:05:02.795 --> 01:05:04.628
But in the center, there is a small,

01:05:04.628 --> 01:05:09.375
cylindrical stone protrusion,
and a grate on top.

01:05:09.375 --> 01:05:10.208
And Kaylee runs up.

01:05:10.208 --> 01:05:13.331
"Quick, quick, help me get this open!"

01:05:13.331 --> 01:05:14.942
At which point--

01:05:14.942 --> 01:05:15.775
Doctor?

01:05:15.775 --> 01:05:17.434
Dr. Dranzel comes forward and goes,

01:05:17.434 --> 01:05:19.581
"Let me take care of this."

01:05:19.581 --> 01:05:20.414
Which is funny, cause Dr. Dranzel

01:05:20.414 --> 01:05:22.627
looks just like himself,
but just all covered in...

01:05:22.627 --> 01:05:23.470
(laughing)

01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:25.399
Facepaint, you can't see his hat.

01:05:25.399 --> 01:05:26.367
It's...

01:05:26.367 --> 01:05:30.193
He's kind of enjoying
this persona for a moment.

01:05:30.193 --> 01:05:32.368
He goes (spits, grunts)

01:05:32.368 --> 01:05:36.337
and strains as he pulls upward, straight.

01:05:36.337 --> 01:05:37.170
Natural 20!

01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:38.860
(cheers)

01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:40.277
Does he strain?

01:05:41.623 --> 01:05:42.456
Throws it aside--

01:05:42.456 --> 01:05:43.553
Everyone can beat doors but us.

01:05:43.553 --> 01:05:45.237
(laughing)

01:05:45.237 --> 01:05:48.287
"And don't you forget it!

01:05:48.287 --> 01:05:49.370
"So, inside?"

01:05:50.577 --> 01:05:52.298
Yes, go, go, go.

01:05:52.298 --> 01:05:53.439
And they all start climbing in.

01:05:53.439 --> 01:05:55.056
Dranzel and Kaylee are helping get

01:05:55.056 --> 01:05:56.636
the peasants down inside first,

01:05:56.636 --> 01:05:58.511
at which point the one
that was following you guys

01:05:58.511 --> 01:05:59.843
turns the corner in the alleyway

01:05:59.843 --> 01:06:02.610
and starts approaching from behind.

01:06:02.610 --> 01:06:06.392
This is the guy with the
long black and grey beard.

01:06:06.392 --> 01:06:08.642
"You, where are you going?"

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:12.046
That gnome again.

01:06:12.046 --> 01:06:14.999
One of us saw him go down this sewer.

01:06:14.999 --> 01:06:16.332
We're following.

01:06:19.764 --> 01:06:20.999
"I'm gonna have to come
back and report this.

01:06:20.999 --> 01:06:22.445
"I don't trust it."

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:23.278
"Hold on one second!"

01:06:23.278 --> 01:06:25.710
And I'm gonna cast Hold Person on him.

01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:27.400
MATT: Okay.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.202
LIAM: Get it, get it, get it Scanlan!

01:06:29.202 --> 01:06:30.035
Get it!

01:06:30.035 --> 01:06:31.351
Natural 20 on his saving throw.

01:06:31.351 --> 01:06:32.184
Oh, no!

01:06:33.511 --> 01:06:34.344
As he turns around,

01:06:34.344 --> 01:06:39.325
and he stops for a second,
looks over his shoulder.

01:06:39.325 --> 01:06:40.737
"Oh, you gotta be kidding me, we got--"

01:06:40.737 --> 01:06:43.777
At which point Kaylee
reaches out with her hand

01:06:43.777 --> 01:06:46.694
and let's see if this works or not.

01:06:50.263 --> 01:06:51.096
5, 8...

01:06:55.459 --> 01:06:57.459
LAURA: Too many guys!

01:07:02.004 --> 01:07:03.813
As he turns around and
goes to walk away, he

01:07:03.813 --> 01:07:05.428
(laughing)

01:07:05.428 --> 01:07:08.597
falls face first asleep on the ground

01:07:08.597 --> 01:07:11.833
on the outside of the alleyway.

01:07:11.833 --> 01:07:12.666
Just, (thuds)

01:07:12.666 --> 01:07:14.893
halfway in the sun of
the main thoroughfare.

01:07:14.893 --> 01:07:18.610
Kaylee runs up real fast and
grabs his ankles and drags him.

01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:19.443
I try to help!

01:07:19.443 --> 01:07:20.667
"Go, go, go!"

01:07:20.667 --> 01:07:21.822
I don't know the ways through the sewers!

01:07:21.822 --> 01:07:23.919
You have to go lead them, not me!

01:07:23.919 --> 01:07:24.752
(sighs)

01:07:24.752 --> 01:07:25.588
She drops the leg down.

01:07:25.588 --> 01:07:27.018
I start dragging him.

01:07:27.018 --> 01:07:28.909
You guys start dragging him off the side,

01:07:28.909 --> 01:07:31.659
and you guys quickly go, dart in.

01:07:32.846 --> 01:07:35.380
As you all jump inside,
Dranzel grabs the grate top.

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:36.666
He gets down behind it--

01:07:36.666 --> 01:07:40.119
Right before he closes it, I step out.

01:07:40.119 --> 01:07:44.018
I step out and I say,
"Take them to safety.

01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:45.263
"Bring them outside the city.

01:07:45.263 --> 01:07:46.763
"Hide, stay safe."

01:07:49.489 --> 01:07:51.366
"All right.

01:07:51.366 --> 01:07:53.192
"Same goes for you, Scanlan."

01:07:53.192 --> 01:07:55.230
Well, I'll do my best.

01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:56.603
"Yeah you will."

01:07:56.603 --> 01:07:58.732
And he pulls it down,
screws it into place,

01:07:58.732 --> 01:08:01.011
to where it feels kind of taut,

01:08:01.011 --> 01:08:03.903
and you are now on your
own outside of this area

01:08:03.903 --> 01:08:08.070
with a sleeping individual as
his snoring slowly subsides.

01:08:11.121 --> 01:08:14.452
He starts rousing from his
slumber about a minute later.

01:08:14.452 --> 01:08:15.869
Rubbing his chin.

01:08:17.037 --> 01:08:18.062
What do you do?

01:08:18.062 --> 01:08:20.180
While he was still asleep, I was

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:24.053
booking it towards the
western gate, away from him.

01:08:24.053 --> 01:08:25.136
Stelth check.

01:08:28.078 --> 01:08:28.911
18.

01:08:33.788 --> 01:08:34.622
Okay.

01:08:36.462 --> 01:08:37.786
All right, so the rest of you guys,

01:08:37.786 --> 01:08:40.754
at this point in time, what's the plan?

01:08:40.754 --> 01:08:42.116
Guys, I'm heading in towards the city.

01:08:42.116 --> 01:08:44.799
Do we have a report yet?

01:08:44.799 --> 01:08:45.734
Keyleth?

01:08:45.734 --> 01:08:46.747
I'm getting nervous about Scanlan.

01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:47.580
MARISHA: Can I hear him?

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:49.349
Am I close enough by yet?

01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:53.796
I'd say by now you've
returned in raven form,

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:56.515
you can hear him over the earpiece.

01:08:56.515 --> 01:08:57.929
LIAM: And it's been how
long since we've seen him

01:08:57.929 --> 01:08:59.046
since he went in?

01:08:59.046 --> 01:08:59.908
MATT: Since Scanlan went in, I'd say--

01:08:59.908 --> 01:09:00.741
Since the bells.

01:09:00.741 --> 01:09:04.011
Since the bells, it's been about...

01:09:04.011 --> 01:09:05.801
Oh, man, about ten minutes.

01:09:05.801 --> 01:09:06.850
Really?

01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:08.031
We should've seen him by now.

01:09:08.031 --> 01:09:11.781
I come down and I land
on Percy's shoulder.

01:09:12.826 --> 01:09:14.761
(caws)

01:09:14.761 --> 01:09:15.596
SAM: Not that again.

01:09:15.596 --> 01:09:16.437
(laughing)

01:09:16.437 --> 01:09:17.533
And then I--

01:09:17.533 --> 01:09:18.374
Someone fell down a well?

01:09:18.374 --> 01:09:19.263
(laughing)

01:09:19.263 --> 01:09:21.834
I come out of raven form.

01:09:21.834 --> 01:09:22.667
Not on my shoulder.

01:09:22.667 --> 01:09:25.526
Not on his, well, maybe
I kind of like slide off.

01:09:25.526 --> 01:09:26.359
Sorry!

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:27.192
Sorry.

01:09:27.192 --> 01:09:28.198
What did you see?

01:09:28.198 --> 01:09:29.696
Report, report!

01:09:29.696 --> 01:09:31.216
Okay.

01:09:31.216 --> 01:09:35.321
They are ripping all of the
townspeople out of their houses.

01:09:35.321 --> 01:09:37.763
It looks like they have their own

01:09:37.763 --> 01:09:40.653
counter plan for a situation like this.

01:09:40.653 --> 01:09:44.153
There was also a band of very strange orcs

01:09:45.254 --> 01:09:48.188
heading this direction,
they were acting strangely,

01:09:48.188 --> 01:09:49.279
I don't trust it.

01:09:49.279 --> 01:09:51.765
We can either get out ahead of them,

01:09:51.765 --> 01:09:54.225
or try and wait and see if...

01:09:54.225 --> 01:09:55.145
VAX: Were they headed this way?

01:09:55.145 --> 01:09:56.005
They were headed this way.

01:09:56.005 --> 01:09:56.838
LIAM: We should probably move then.

01:09:56.838 --> 01:09:57.671
LAURA: Did you see Scanlan?

01:09:57.671 --> 01:09:58.618
Then we should--

01:09:58.618 --> 01:09:59.864
I did not see Scanlan.

01:09:59.864 --> 01:10:00.937
Let's head towards the center of town.

01:10:00.937 --> 01:10:01.953
They might have him held prisoner.

01:10:01.953 --> 01:10:03.322
MARISHA: They might
have him held prisoner.

01:10:03.322 --> 01:10:04.836
Why didn't we give a gatestone?

01:10:04.836 --> 01:10:05.993
We should always give--

01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:06.959
LAURA: Because we're fucking morons!

01:10:06.959 --> 01:10:08.560
I didn't know he was going to go that far!

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.102
LAURA: I thought he was just going to the gate.

01:10:10.102 --> 01:10:12.160
LIAM: Every time, that's the thing, okay?

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:13.321
Gate stones.

01:10:13.321 --> 01:10:15.780
I promise when this is over,

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.780
I will surgically implant it in him.

01:10:20.274 --> 01:10:21.107
Scanlan, can you--

01:10:21.107 --> 01:10:23.209
Scanlan, can you hear us at all?

01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:24.184
TALIESIN: Hello?

01:10:24.184 --> 01:10:26.191
TRAVIS: Anything?

01:10:26.191 --> 01:10:27.079
We just gotta go in.

01:10:27.079 --> 01:10:28.075
Dammit!

01:10:28.075 --> 01:10:29.781
I'm gonna start making
my way on the rooftops

01:10:29.781 --> 01:10:31.442
towards the center of the town, I'm like

01:10:31.442 --> 01:10:33.811
"I'm heading in, I'm keeping to the roof,

01:10:33.811 --> 01:10:35.271
"if I'm going to take any shots

01:10:35.271 --> 01:10:36.431
"I'll try and take them quietly."

01:10:36.431 --> 01:10:37.264
I fly up and I--

01:10:37.264 --> 01:10:38.921
I go along the roofline with him.

01:10:38.921 --> 01:10:41.585
I fly up on the broom, and then I

01:10:41.585 --> 01:10:43.735
land on the rooftop and stealth.

01:10:43.735 --> 01:10:44.568
Okay.

01:10:44.568 --> 01:10:47.390
It's at this point in time
you see the two giant eagles,

01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:49.822
the ones that took Keyleth off earlier.

01:10:49.822 --> 01:10:51.322
As you come up on your
broom, it kind of sees you.

01:10:51.322 --> 01:10:53.375
(screech)

01:10:53.375 --> 01:10:54.844
TALIESIN: Oh, I've been watching those things.

01:10:54.844 --> 01:10:55.677
Right.

01:10:55.677 --> 01:10:56.874
And as you're having this discussion,

01:10:56.874 --> 01:10:58.788
they notice up her float up and

01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:01.116
kind of see you guys
moving in towards the city.

01:11:01.116 --> 01:11:02.807
One of them just turns around,

01:11:02.807 --> 01:11:04.697
heads back to the center of town.

01:11:04.697 --> 01:11:05.530
LAURA: Eh, shitballs.

01:11:05.530 --> 01:11:06.540
Another one's taking a cheap shot at you.

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:07.540
Towards you.

01:11:08.708 --> 01:11:10.291
Roll initiative.

01:11:12.876 --> 01:11:13.709
Everybody who's gonna have anything

01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:14.679
to do with this right now.

01:11:14.679 --> 01:11:15.967
Oh, I'm getting in on this shit, too.

01:11:15.967 --> 01:11:16.800
LAURA: Yeah.

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.244
How far away from--

01:11:18.244 --> 01:11:19.077
24.

01:11:19.077 --> 01:11:19.910
They're probably a good--

01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:21.648
LIAM: Way up high in the sky on this one?

01:11:21.648 --> 01:11:23.048
MARISHA: Are we trying to get this--

01:11:23.048 --> 01:11:25.136
We're talking about 100 to
150 feet up, comparatively.

01:11:25.136 --> 01:11:26.411
Are we trying to get this eagle?

01:11:26.411 --> 01:11:27.349
Is that what we're trying--

01:11:27.349 --> 01:11:28.231
Yeah.

01:11:28.231 --> 01:11:29.119
It's trying to kill me.

01:11:29.119 --> 01:11:29.952
TALIESIN: 19.

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:31.961
Yeah, can I get in on that as well?

01:11:31.961 --> 01:11:33.009
MATT: Yeah, roll initiative.

01:11:33.009 --> 01:11:34.280
All right, so...

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.530
LAURA: 24.

01:11:35.530 --> 01:11:36.754
MATT: 24, Jesus.

01:11:36.754 --> 01:11:38.197
And 19.

01:11:38.197 --> 01:11:39.030
MATT: 19.

01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.863
18.

01:11:39.863 --> 01:11:40.696
Nice!

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:41.696
Yeah, man!

01:11:42.114 --> 01:11:44.745
MATT: (sneezes)
Sorry, what did you get?

01:11:44.745 --> 01:11:45.578
ASHLEY: 18.

01:11:45.578 --> 01:11:46.411
MATT: 18, all right.

01:11:46.411 --> 01:11:47.411
LAURA: Sarenrae blesses you.

01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:49.083
17.

01:11:51.141 --> 01:11:52.912
12 for Keyleth.

01:11:52.912 --> 01:11:54.745
MATT: All right.

01:11:55.597 --> 01:11:56.430
All right.

01:11:57.608 --> 01:12:00.927
All right, Vex, as the eagle swoops in,

01:12:00.927 --> 01:12:03.916
you have a brief moment
where it's coming at you.

01:12:03.916 --> 01:12:05.432
You can go ahead and make your shots at it

01:12:05.432 --> 01:12:07.101
or whatever you wanna do this round.

01:12:07.101 --> 01:12:07.934
What do you want to do?

01:12:07.934 --> 01:12:08.767
How--

01:12:08.767 --> 01:12:10.438
if I, if I land on the
ground and shoot at it,

01:12:10.438 --> 01:12:12.438
will it be within range?

01:12:13.312 --> 01:12:14.145
MATT: At the speed it's going,

01:12:14.145 --> 01:12:14.978
you're not gonna be able to

01:12:14.978 --> 01:12:16.010
get back on the ground this round

01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:16.843
unless you spend your
whole round getting there.

01:12:16.843 --> 01:12:17.676
Then I shoot at it from the air.

01:12:17.676 --> 01:12:21.759
MATT: Okay, so two
shots at a disadvantage.

01:12:24.763 --> 01:12:26.867
Uh, 25 on the first.

01:12:26.867 --> 01:12:29.260
On the first, all righty, that hits.

01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:30.510
LAURA: Okay.

01:12:33.374 --> 01:12:34.949
17 on the first hit.

01:12:34.949 --> 01:12:36.233
MATT: 17 damage?

01:12:36.233 --> 01:12:37.158
Yes.

01:12:37.158 --> 01:12:38.274
MATT: All righty.

01:12:38.274 --> 01:12:40.113
And 24 on the second hit.

01:12:40.113 --> 01:12:43.780
TRAVIS: Dang, girl.
MATT: That hits.

01:12:45.171 --> 01:12:46.608
Uh, 13 on the second hit.

01:12:46.608 --> 01:12:49.435
Okay, as you, this is with
a disadvantage, right?

01:12:49.435 --> 01:12:50.268
LAURA: Yeah.

01:12:50.268 --> 01:12:51.211
As you release the first arrow,

01:12:51.211 --> 01:12:53.904
wings are up, giant sharp beak extended,

01:12:53.904 --> 01:12:56.274
its claws in the air, the
arrow sinks into its body,

01:12:56.274 --> 01:12:57.465
but it still kind of just shakes it off,

01:12:57.465 --> 01:12:59.510
continuing going into a
further dive toward you,

01:12:59.510 --> 01:13:00.343
its wings outward.

01:13:00.343 --> 01:13:01.176
LAURA: Fucker!

01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:02.279
The second arrow, the second arrow

01:13:02.279 --> 01:13:03.404
strikes at the side of the face,

01:13:03.404 --> 01:13:04.410
kinda scrapes across and embeds

01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:05.736
in front of its winged shoulder.

01:13:05.736 --> 01:13:06.569
At which point, its form goes

01:13:06.569 --> 01:13:08.132
(wooshing noise)

01:13:08.132 --> 01:13:11.042
into what you see to
be a female elven form

01:13:11.042 --> 01:13:11.875
(gasps)

01:13:11.875 --> 01:13:16.329
and then just drops
straight down for 100 feet.

01:13:16.329 --> 01:13:17.544
TALIESIN: Into the pit?

01:13:17.544 --> 01:13:18.377
Into the pit?

01:13:18.377 --> 01:13:19.358
Uh, no, this is more
inside the city right now.

01:13:19.358 --> 01:13:20.191
Damn.

01:13:20.191 --> 01:13:21.024
But she was 250 feet up!

01:13:21.024 --> 01:13:22.328
That turned out to be about 100 feet up.

01:13:22.328 --> 01:13:23.652
That still sounds pretty bad!

01:13:23.652 --> 01:13:24.657
Really bad.

01:13:24.657 --> 01:13:26.730
SAM: I don't wanna drop from...

01:13:26.730 --> 01:13:28.809
TRAVIS: It's like softball, right?

01:13:28.809 --> 01:13:29.996
I'm just waiting.

01:13:31.163 --> 01:13:32.493
You guys watch as she just goes

01:13:32.493 --> 01:13:34.022
(falling sound, thud)

01:13:34.022 --> 01:13:35.180
(laughing)

01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.331
Like, there's a little--

01:13:37.331 --> 01:13:38.164
LAURA: Oh, no.

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:39.149
A little elf puddle?

01:13:39.149 --> 01:13:39.982
TALIESIN: Is that other one still looking?

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:41.683
MATT: The other one's still looking.

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:43.073
Out of bad news range?

01:13:43.073 --> 01:13:45.445
Uh, no, still within bad news range.

01:13:45.445 --> 01:13:46.495
ASHLEY: Take the shot.

01:13:46.495 --> 01:13:47.727
LAURA: Do it, Percy!

01:13:47.727 --> 01:13:49.920
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, not
only am I gonna take a shot--

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:50.753
TRAVIS: Gonna ring that bell, are you?

01:13:50.753 --> 01:13:52.457
I'm gonna take a, gonna take a wing shot.

01:13:52.457 --> 01:13:55.602
Keyleth runs towards the girl who fell.

01:13:55.602 --> 01:13:57.613
LAURA: Good job, good job, guys.

01:13:57.613 --> 01:13:59.414
MATT: So you start
heading in that direction.

01:13:59.414 --> 01:14:00.247
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:14:00.247 --> 01:14:01.390
MATT: Taking your two shots.

01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:02.705
I'm gonna do a ring shot,
we'll see what happens.

01:14:02.705 --> 01:14:03.716
TRAVIS: If you miss, we move.

01:14:03.716 --> 01:14:04.549
MATT: Okay.

01:14:04.549 --> 01:14:07.182
Oh, yeah, that's 28.

01:14:07.182 --> 01:14:08.146
28 hits.

01:14:08.146 --> 01:14:11.033
This is gonna suck for her.

01:14:11.033 --> 01:14:11.866
Here we go.

01:14:11.866 --> 01:14:12.699
(explosion noise)

01:14:12.699 --> 01:14:13.532
Really loud--

01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:14.365
MATT: Loud, echoing blasts--

01:14:14.365 --> 01:14:15.198
They knew we were coming already.

01:14:15.198 --> 01:14:16.185
MATT: Echoing through the city.

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:20.010
They're already gathering
people in the center of town.

01:14:20.010 --> 01:14:20.843
A little late now.

01:14:20.843 --> 01:14:21.820
We kill a bunch of them,

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:22.924
oh God, that's awful.

01:14:22.924 --> 01:14:24.117
Yeah, that's pretty bad.

01:14:24.117 --> 01:14:26.652
Uh, 13 points of piercing damage.

01:14:26.652 --> 01:14:27.485
MATT: Okay.

01:14:27.485 --> 01:14:29.740
And she also has to make
a strength saving throw.

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:31.753
Uh, that is gonna be a...

01:14:31.753 --> 01:14:33.249
19?

01:14:33.249 --> 01:14:35.253
Not going to beat that.

01:14:35.253 --> 01:14:36.250
12.

01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:37.191
I think she--

01:14:37.191 --> 01:14:39.893
It says she gets knocked prone,

01:14:39.893 --> 01:14:40.894
so I don't know what you want to

01:14:40.894 --> 01:14:42.342
call that for something flying, but--

01:14:42.342 --> 01:14:43.424
That's, she's falling now.

01:14:43.424 --> 01:14:44.257
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:14:44.257 --> 01:14:45.176
Yep.

01:14:45.176 --> 01:14:46.996
And so she's falling, you
hit her, one of the wings

01:14:46.996 --> 01:14:49.643
and she begins plummeting downward,

01:14:49.643 --> 01:14:52.945
not able to gather air at the
moment underneath the wings.

01:14:52.945 --> 01:14:53.888
Are you taking your second shot?

01:14:53.888 --> 01:14:54.779
Uh, sure, I'll just take,

01:14:54.779 --> 01:14:56.840
and for this one, I'm gonna be an asshole

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:59.179
and just take a sharpshooter shot.

01:14:59.179 --> 01:15:00.012
MATT: Okay.

01:15:00.012 --> 01:15:00.931
And I'll use the big die!

01:15:00.931 --> 01:15:01.764
MATT: Go for it.

01:15:01.764 --> 01:15:02.765
Trade up.

01:15:02.765 --> 01:15:04.342
Uh, that's a--

01:15:04.342 --> 01:15:05.640
I'll say before you commit,
I'll say this has disadvantage

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:08.126
because it went from
flying at a smooth pace

01:15:08.126 --> 01:15:10.045
to plummeting and you have to quickly--

01:15:10.045 --> 01:15:11.978
TALIESIN: I had to reload
in the middle, so like--

01:15:11.978 --> 01:15:12.811
Yeah.

01:15:12.811 --> 01:15:13.644
I'm, like, skeet shooting here.

01:15:13.644 --> 01:15:14.477
MATT: Yeah.

01:15:14.477 --> 01:15:15.310
Ugh.

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:17.949
That's a, I'm gonna miss.

01:15:17.949 --> 01:15:19.834
That's like a 5 to hit, so that...

01:15:19.834 --> 01:15:21.354
That's 12.

01:15:21.354 --> 01:15:22.454
12 just hits.

01:15:22.454 --> 01:15:23.479
(gasps)

01:15:23.479 --> 01:15:25.002
Giant eagle AC is not that great, man!

01:15:25.002 --> 01:15:26.146
That's so sad!

01:15:26.146 --> 01:15:28.598
Oh God, I feel bad now!

01:15:28.598 --> 01:15:29.431
(laughing)

01:15:29.431 --> 01:15:30.264
LAURA: 12?

01:15:30.264 --> 01:15:31.683
MATT: Giant eagle
doesn't have a crazy AC.

01:15:31.683 --> 01:15:33.210
That, oh man, I really feel--

01:15:33.210 --> 01:15:34.128
MATT: It's more of a travel form,

01:15:34.128 --> 01:15:35.597
it's not meant for...

01:15:35.597 --> 01:15:36.430
Fighting.

01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:37.263
You know, main fighting.

01:15:37.263 --> 01:15:38.323
The one that was going for you is

01:15:38.323 --> 01:15:39.749
just 'cause you were the
one that was nearest to it.

01:15:39.749 --> 01:15:43.832
It wasn't expecting a hail
of arrows in its face.

01:15:44.765 --> 01:15:46.588
29 points of damage.

01:15:46.588 --> 01:15:48.828
And with that, you see it falls an eagle,

01:15:48.828 --> 01:15:50.886
and then (wooshing noise)
into a person, it falls--

01:15:50.886 --> 01:15:52.196
(laughing)

01:15:52.196 --> 01:15:55.160
and disappear behind the skyline

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.570
of the building of Westruun that

01:15:57.570 --> 01:15:59.120
block your view of the center of town.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.344
Well, they don't know
who's coming, at least.

01:16:01.344 --> 01:16:03.025
ASHLEY: Are we close enough to
loot that first body?

01:16:03.025 --> 01:16:04.663
Sure, you guys--

01:16:04.663 --> 01:16:05.920
MARISHA: Well, I was headed that way.

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:06.867
ASHLEY: We're headed that way.

01:16:06.867 --> 01:16:07.762
You guys then--

01:16:07.762 --> 01:16:09.170
TALIESIN: I'm staying on the roof.

01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:10.778
Moving around the chasm
you create, you head

01:16:10.778 --> 01:16:12.954
inside the western gate
of Westruun at this point.

01:16:12.954 --> 01:16:14.518
MARISHA: Hang on, wait, well,

01:16:14.518 --> 01:16:16.348
oh, I'm headed to the body still?

01:16:16.348 --> 01:16:17.287
It's inside the gate?

01:16:17.287 --> 01:16:18.120
Yeah.

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.388
Yeah, it fell inside the gate of the city.

01:16:19.388 --> 01:16:22.886
You approach, and it's a rough scene.

01:16:22.886 --> 01:16:24.562
Fell on, like, the head and the shoulder.

01:16:24.562 --> 01:16:25.839
The rest of the body's kind of--

01:16:25.839 --> 01:16:26.672
LAURA: Ew!

01:16:26.672 --> 01:16:28.473
Accordioned in.

01:16:28.473 --> 01:16:29.903
Like the body, does it appear to be

01:16:29.903 --> 01:16:32.771
any druid related to the Ashari clan?

01:16:32.771 --> 01:16:36.867
Looking it over, make
an investigation check.

01:16:36.867 --> 01:16:38.831
TALIESIN: Figure out
which end is up first.

01:16:38.831 --> 01:16:40.520
I need a really good check.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.392
My investigation's not very good.

01:16:42.392 --> 01:16:43.408
It's your dad!

01:16:43.408 --> 01:16:44.241
Oh!

01:16:44.241 --> 01:16:46.778
(laughing)

01:16:46.778 --> 01:16:48.065
20.

01:16:48.065 --> 01:16:48.898
20.

01:16:48.898 --> 01:16:50.438
You take a quick glance
over, checking where any

01:16:50.438 --> 01:16:54.105
ceremonial markings of
the Ashari are, none.

01:16:55.091 --> 01:16:56.852
This individual appears to be more of

01:16:56.852 --> 01:16:59.352
a primal-based Druidic talent.

01:17:00.506 --> 01:17:03.191
There are tattoos, pretty basic,

01:17:03.191 --> 01:17:07.500
various animal totems that
are inscribed on the body.

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.038
You're familiar with
this form of druidic magic.

01:17:09.038 --> 01:17:11.563
It's a less-refined version of

01:17:11.563 --> 01:17:13.421
what the Ashari people learn and teach.

01:17:13.421 --> 01:17:14.348
MARISHA: Gotcha.

01:17:14.348 --> 01:17:16.604
But yeah, there's no inclination

01:17:16.604 --> 01:17:18.489
this is a member of the Ashari.

01:17:18.489 --> 01:17:19.322
Okay.

01:17:19.322 --> 01:17:21.049
So, is there anything good on her?

01:17:21.049 --> 01:17:22.299
There is a...

01:17:23.711 --> 01:17:27.381
A soaked set of leather armor.

01:17:27.381 --> 01:17:28.214
(chuckles)

01:17:28.214 --> 01:17:29.670
TRAVIS: Soaked in what?
MARISHA: Non-magical?

01:17:29.670 --> 01:17:32.863
Non-magical, from what you can gather.

01:17:32.863 --> 01:17:33.863
SAM: Pee.

01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:38.166
And what looks to be a
shattered quarter-staff

01:17:38.166 --> 01:17:40.720
that may have been landed on.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.803
(groans)

01:17:43.991 --> 01:17:46.906
Beyond that, you're gonna have to get

01:17:46.906 --> 01:17:48.659
sifting through the remains,

01:17:48.659 --> 01:17:49.780
it's not gonna be a fun experience

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:51.104
for what little you may gather.

01:17:51.104 --> 01:17:51.937
I'll let it go.

01:17:51.937 --> 01:17:52.770
LIAM: You gonna start harvesting?

01:17:52.770 --> 01:17:53.603
I'll let it go.

01:17:53.603 --> 01:17:54.718
(laughing)

01:17:54.718 --> 01:17:56.320
MATT: "Start harvesting."

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:58.491
TRAVIS: She made her choice.

01:17:58.491 --> 01:18:00.209
(laughing)

01:18:00.209 --> 01:18:01.738
Well, I'm gonna start
rooftopping towards the center.

01:18:01.738 --> 01:18:03.551
If I see anything interesting
going on in the city,

01:18:03.551 --> 01:18:05.153
I wanna stop and investigate.

01:18:05.153 --> 01:18:05.986
Ditto!

01:18:05.986 --> 01:18:06.819
Sneaking from rooftop to rooftop?

01:18:06.819 --> 01:18:07.652
If I can, can I do a bit of--

01:18:07.652 --> 01:18:08.973
I'm gonna do that, for sure.

01:18:08.973 --> 01:18:10.857
Can I use acrobatics?

01:18:10.857 --> 01:18:13.690
You, this more of a,
this isn't acrobatics,

01:18:13.690 --> 01:18:14.664
this is more of a jump.

01:18:14.664 --> 01:18:17.836
Because there are large,
large city street gaps

01:18:17.836 --> 01:18:19.121
that are, like, 25 to 30 feet.

01:18:19.121 --> 01:18:19.954
MARISHA: What about parkouring?

01:18:19.954 --> 01:18:21.118
But if I can parkour it, I can find,

01:18:21.118 --> 01:18:21.951
I wanna be able to...

01:18:21.951 --> 01:18:22.784
Parkour, parkour!

01:18:22.784 --> 01:18:23.617
I wanna try and be smart about it

01:18:23.617 --> 01:18:25.010
and find it any way I can make it.

01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:27.144
Right, make an acrobatics check.

01:18:27.144 --> 01:18:27.977
TALIESIN: An acrobatics check?

01:18:27.977 --> 01:18:28.810
Thank you.

01:18:28.810 --> 01:18:29.643
SAM: Amateur Spider-man.

01:18:29.643 --> 01:18:30.476
LAURA: Can I join in?

01:18:30.476 --> 01:18:31.715
I was gonna join in.

01:18:31.715 --> 01:18:32.648
Up there.

01:18:32.648 --> 01:18:34.642
MATT: Do you want to get
off your broom and do that?

01:18:34.642 --> 01:18:35.482
That was the thing, yeah, I was gonna

01:18:35.482 --> 01:18:37.909
fly up on the broom and
land on the roofs and then--

01:18:37.909 --> 01:18:38.742
MATT: Gotcha.

01:18:38.742 --> 01:18:40.228
Yeah, so you go ahead
and you get up with him

01:18:40.228 --> 01:18:41.669
and you can go--

01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:43.904
the two of you can start, like,
parkouring off the rooftop.

01:18:43.904 --> 01:18:45.517
LIAM: There's a mechanical engineer on the roof.

01:18:45.517 --> 01:18:46.552
(laughing)

01:18:46.552 --> 01:18:47.872
23.

01:18:47.872 --> 01:18:48.705
MATT: 23?

01:18:49.731 --> 01:18:51.099
SAM: (screams)

01:18:51.099 --> 01:18:52.940
You guys make it a
couple of streets before

01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:55.409
you reach a point where this block does,

01:18:55.409 --> 01:18:56.676
'cause the main street intersects

01:18:56.676 --> 01:18:58.341
with another main street
that goes southward

01:18:58.341 --> 01:19:00.497
and the gap is about
30 feet to jump across

01:19:00.497 --> 01:19:01.448
and you know from experience that

01:19:01.448 --> 01:19:03.587
you couldn't do that with a regular jump.

01:19:03.587 --> 01:19:04.538
I've got an idea.

01:19:04.538 --> 01:19:05.944
If you give me the
broom, I'll just hold on

01:19:05.944 --> 01:19:08.234
and plant me down if we see anything.

01:19:08.234 --> 01:19:09.861
We'll just keep low by the roof.

01:19:09.861 --> 01:19:10.694
(laughing)

01:19:10.694 --> 01:19:11.865
LAURA: Can't you just
sit on the broom with me?

01:19:11.865 --> 01:19:13.869
What is going on, are Grog and Pike and I

01:19:13.869 --> 01:19:15.367
just supposed to stand
over here by the gate?

01:19:15.367 --> 01:19:16.367
Are you guys gonna head off?

01:19:16.367 --> 01:19:17.259
MARISHA: We have a plan.

01:19:17.259 --> 01:19:18.222
I thought we were going in.

01:19:18.222 --> 01:19:19.333
We're heading into the city--

01:19:19.333 --> 01:19:20.411
LAURA: I thought we were all going in.

01:19:20.411 --> 01:19:21.622
I mean, we had a plan, and then

01:19:21.622 --> 01:19:23.019
we didn't have a plan, so we have like...

01:19:23.019 --> 01:19:24.439
LIAM: We're going seven
different directions.

01:19:24.439 --> 01:19:26.129
You look up as you see,
suddenly glance overhead,

01:19:26.129 --> 01:19:29.121
a shadow from one rooftop to another.

01:19:29.121 --> 01:19:31.121
Make a perception check.

01:19:32.818 --> 01:19:33.651
Uh, 18.

01:19:33.651 --> 01:19:34.484
TALIESIN: It's Batman!

01:19:34.484 --> 01:19:35.317
18.

01:19:35.317 --> 01:19:36.150
You glance up and you see the

01:19:36.150 --> 01:19:38.733
dangling, kicking feet of Percy

01:19:40.691 --> 01:19:42.721
underneath a broom that
just (wooshing noise)

01:19:42.721 --> 01:19:43.740
across the top of that.

01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:44.668
All right.

01:19:44.668 --> 01:19:46.724
I didn't know there was room on there!

01:19:46.724 --> 01:19:47.830
They're traveling, yes?

01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:49.647
Yeah, they're traveling
back inward to the city.

01:19:49.647 --> 01:19:51.050
All right.

01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:52.181
Well, that's good.

01:19:52.181 --> 01:19:54.707
I can't, I probably can't catch up.

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:57.222
I'm just gonna keep hoofing it.

01:19:57.222 --> 01:19:58.066
LAURA: Wait, but the earrings!

01:19:58.066 --> 01:19:59.995
Oh wait, I can hear, yes, yes!

01:19:59.995 --> 01:20:01.540
Ooh!

01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:02.373
(laughing)

01:20:02.373 --> 01:20:03.206
Thank you, I forgot about that!

01:20:03.206 --> 01:20:04.039
Uh, yeah.

01:20:04.039 --> 01:20:06.664
Hey, hi, oi, guys, oi, oi.

01:20:06.664 --> 01:20:08.107
LAURA: Scanlan!

01:20:08.107 --> 01:20:09.065
SAM: Oi, oi.

01:20:09.065 --> 01:20:10.199
SAM: How's it going?

01:20:10.199 --> 01:20:11.304
Did my plan work?

01:20:11.304 --> 01:20:12.278
MARISHA: I don't know, did your plan work?

01:20:12.278 --> 01:20:13.123
TALIESIN: What was your plan?

01:20:13.123 --> 01:20:14.448
My plan was to send all the Goliaths,

01:20:14.448 --> 01:20:16.490
all of them, out through the main gate.

01:20:16.490 --> 01:20:18.050
Did they all come through the main gate?

01:20:18.050 --> 01:20:18.883
No.

01:20:18.883 --> 01:20:19.716
No, definitely not.

01:20:19.716 --> 01:20:20.880
LIAM: If there was only six, it worked.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.342
MARISHA: Scanlan, it appears they are

01:20:22.342 --> 01:20:23.897
doubling down in the center of the town.

01:20:23.897 --> 01:20:26.477
Do you have any idea on why
they would be doing this?

01:20:26.477 --> 01:20:30.091
Well, I don't know,
they're very perceptive.

01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:34.304
I may have alerted all
of them to our presence.

01:20:34.304 --> 01:20:35.581
MARISHA: Oh, fantastic.
SAM: But...

01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:37.515
It was a distraction.
MARISHA: Sure.

01:20:37.515 --> 01:20:39.447
And in a sense, that was my mission, so--

01:20:39.447 --> 01:20:40.831
TALIESIN: A distraction from what?

01:20:40.831 --> 01:20:42.638
LAURA: You know what, we killed nine of them.

01:20:42.638 --> 01:20:44.540
MARISHA: A distraction from

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:46.407
their terrible, terrible lives.

01:20:46.407 --> 01:20:47.970
TRAVIS: Good job, Scanlan, mission accomplished.

01:20:47.970 --> 01:20:50.111
Yes, thank you, thank you.

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:51.507
ASHLEY: Hey Scanlan, I'm glad you're okay.

01:20:51.507 --> 01:20:53.801
Oh, thanks, is that Pike?

01:20:53.801 --> 01:20:54.634
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:20:54.634 --> 01:20:55.467
Oh, hi, Pike!

01:20:55.467 --> 01:20:56.300
ASHLEY: Hi!

01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:57.775
Oh, how's it going out there?

01:20:57.775 --> 01:20:58.978
Oh, it's good, it's good--

01:20:58.978 --> 01:21:00.107
Can we do this--

01:21:00.107 --> 01:21:01.440
Okay, okay, okay.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:05.398
What should I do, where
should I go, who should I kill?

01:21:05.398 --> 01:21:07.080
LIAM: Stay put and let us come to you.

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:08.261
What do you see around you?

01:21:08.261 --> 01:21:09.187
MARISHA: Yeah, where are you?

01:21:09.187 --> 01:21:11.463
SAM: Idiots on broomsticks flying around.

01:21:11.463 --> 01:21:13.355
LAURA: Oh, shit, that's us!

01:21:13.355 --> 01:21:14.188
All right.

01:21:14.188 --> 01:21:16.234
Can we all convene in an alley?

01:21:16.234 --> 01:21:17.163
You do.

01:21:17.163 --> 01:21:19.536
You convene in an alley.

01:21:19.536 --> 01:21:21.988
Within the next few
minutes, a little bit of a

01:21:21.988 --> 01:21:23.442
confusing telephone bit
going back and forth,

01:21:23.442 --> 01:21:26.277
but you do eventually gather.

01:21:26.277 --> 01:21:28.737
At this time, you guys do hear

01:21:28.737 --> 01:21:30.850
what sounds like some voices shouting

01:21:30.850 --> 01:21:33.850
about a block and a half up the way.

01:21:35.670 --> 01:21:37.034
LAURA: Shit.

01:21:37.034 --> 01:21:38.371
MARISHA: Okay.

01:21:38.371 --> 01:21:39.677
TRAVIS: Are there buildings?

01:21:39.677 --> 01:21:40.659
SAM: Are we all together now?

01:21:40.659 --> 01:21:41.492
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

01:21:41.492 --> 01:21:44.248
By the way, hi, hi, this is me.

01:21:44.248 --> 01:21:45.740
LAURA: Oh my god, you don't
even look like yourself.

01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:46.698
I look pretty cool.

01:21:46.698 --> 01:21:47.867
TRAVIS: It's so good to see you.

01:21:47.867 --> 01:21:49.022
We should get inside for a moment.

01:21:49.022 --> 01:21:49.874
We should.

01:21:49.874 --> 01:21:53.349
Is there a wine cellar
or door or something

01:21:53.349 --> 01:21:55.002
that we can beat in, or a window?

01:21:55.002 --> 01:21:56.329
There are windows, you
don't see a wine cellar

01:21:56.329 --> 01:21:57.734
in the immediate vicinity
of this alleyway.

01:21:57.734 --> 01:22:01.319
LIAM: I'll get it open quietly,
I'm not gonna break anything!

01:22:01.319 --> 01:22:02.786
TRAVIS: Can I look in the window first?

01:22:02.786 --> 01:22:03.716
Yeah, you go ahead and glance in.

01:22:03.716 --> 01:22:05.716
Make a perception check.

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:08.700
I see nothing. It's a 2.

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:09.770
MATT: It is very dark.

01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:11.179
There's no light inside, and--

01:22:11.179 --> 01:22:12.138
LAURA: What about our darkvision?

01:22:12.138 --> 01:22:13.184
Can we see anything in there?

01:22:13.184 --> 01:22:14.017
No.

01:22:14.017 --> 01:22:15.684
Even if your darkvision,
you guys see as well,

01:22:15.684 --> 01:22:16.646
there's nothing inside.

01:22:16.646 --> 01:22:17.940
The building appears to be vacant.

01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:19.212
LIAM: Is it locked?

01:22:19.212 --> 01:22:20.907
The window is locked.

01:22:20.907 --> 01:22:22.172
Very minor lock.

01:22:22.172 --> 01:22:23.346
Well, I just rolled a natural 20, so...

01:22:23.346 --> 01:22:24.903
LAURA: You wasted it on a window?

01:22:24.903 --> 01:22:27.517
MATT: That was the most deft
unlocking you've ever done.

01:22:27.517 --> 01:22:28.350
LIAM: I hit it like Fonzie.

01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:29.183
Yeah.

01:22:29.183 --> 01:22:31.282
(laughing)

01:22:31.282 --> 01:22:33.691
We pop in the window.

01:22:33.691 --> 01:22:34.524
Great.

01:22:34.524 --> 01:22:35.891
You guys all crawl inside of the room, and

01:22:35.891 --> 01:22:39.308
looking inside, you do notice that the...

01:22:40.269 --> 01:22:43.445
Some of the furniture
is kind of tipped over,

01:22:43.445 --> 01:22:45.242
the front door, actually, that leads

01:22:45.242 --> 01:22:48.489
out to the main road,
the south-facing road,

01:22:48.489 --> 01:22:53.195
the knob is broken off like
someone just kicked the door in.

01:22:53.195 --> 01:22:55.817
And it looks like there were
signs of a minor struggle,

01:22:55.817 --> 01:22:58.335
but there's no bloodshed
from what you can see.

01:22:58.335 --> 01:23:01.461
Most of, if any, belongings that

01:23:01.461 --> 01:23:02.868
had any value have been taken.

01:23:02.868 --> 01:23:05.303
The place looks stripped
of anything metallic.

01:23:05.303 --> 01:23:07.760
It looks like it's been pretty heavily

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.519
ransacked inside here.

01:23:09.519 --> 01:23:10.891
MARISHA: Grog.
TRAVIS: Yeah?

01:23:10.891 --> 01:23:14.024
They were dragging everyone
out of every available door,

01:23:14.024 --> 01:23:16.356
and dragging them to the
city, the center of the city.

01:23:16.356 --> 01:23:17.189
Why?

01:23:18.382 --> 01:23:20.719
TRAVIS: People shields.

01:23:20.719 --> 01:23:21.882
Meat shields.

01:23:21.882 --> 01:23:22.715
Meat shields?

01:23:22.715 --> 01:23:23.821
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Right.

01:23:23.821 --> 01:23:24.654
Okay.

01:23:24.654 --> 01:23:27.026
So we go to them, and if we get too close,

01:23:27.026 --> 01:23:28.765
they slit all their throats.

01:23:28.765 --> 01:23:31.966
It's like basic Goliath logic.

01:23:31.966 --> 01:23:32.799
LAURA: Lovely.

01:23:32.799 --> 01:23:35.872
LIAM: So is maybe the one-on-one combat

01:23:35.872 --> 01:23:38.111
our only option at the moment?

01:23:38.111 --> 01:23:41.177
Do we have any other option?

01:23:41.177 --> 01:23:42.753
How many were there total?

01:23:42.753 --> 01:23:43.586
We don't know how many...

01:23:43.586 --> 01:23:44.979
Probably 30 to 40 now.

01:23:44.979 --> 01:23:46.208
SAM: Oh, okay.

01:23:46.208 --> 01:23:47.813
Probably down to 20 or 30.

01:23:47.813 --> 01:23:48.646
Well.

01:23:49.864 --> 01:23:51.743
Wait, there was 30 or 40 to start,

01:23:51.743 --> 01:23:52.914
and we killed nine of them?

01:23:52.914 --> 01:23:54.478
Remember, he said we were down to like 50.

01:23:54.478 --> 01:23:56.435
We killed, like, nine-ish.

01:23:56.435 --> 01:23:57.440
SAM: Oh, so 40-ish.

01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:58.337
So two left.

01:23:58.337 --> 01:24:00.059
LAURA: Six left, Grog, then, six?

01:24:00.059 --> 01:24:01.190
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's like a thousand.

01:24:01.190 --> 01:24:02.317
(laughing)

01:24:02.317 --> 01:24:03.789
TALIESIN: Let's...

01:24:05.275 --> 01:24:06.108
MARISHA: Okay.

01:24:07.218 --> 01:24:08.051
All right.

01:24:08.051 --> 01:24:09.275
SAM: I've got a plan.

01:24:09.275 --> 01:24:10.865
I go to the center of town.

01:24:10.865 --> 01:24:11.698
Yeah.

01:24:11.698 --> 01:24:12.614
I create a distraction.

01:24:12.614 --> 01:24:14.686
(laughing)

01:24:14.686 --> 01:24:15.519
LAURA: Seriously?

01:24:15.519 --> 01:24:18.106
That's pretty much all
my plans are, always.

01:24:18.106 --> 01:24:19.418
TRAVIS: What time is it?

01:24:19.418 --> 01:24:21.744
MATT: Right now, you're
pushing early afternoon.

01:24:21.744 --> 01:24:24.935
It's probably, I'd say the
equivalent of about 1, 1:30.

01:24:24.935 --> 01:24:26.203
LAURA: Jeez.
TRAVIS: Perfect.

01:24:26.203 --> 01:24:27.036
Last question I have.

01:24:27.036 --> 01:24:29.342
Do we know where Wilhand's
residence used to be?

01:24:29.342 --> 01:24:30.910
MATT: You do, you would know very well.

01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:31.752
It's outside of town.

01:24:31.752 --> 01:24:32.700
MATT: You spent a lot of your time--

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:33.625
Outside or inside?

01:24:33.625 --> 01:24:34.799
It's inside the town, but it's a

01:24:34.799 --> 01:24:38.281
little bit northwest of the center area.

01:24:38.281 --> 01:24:40.600
So it's closer to where a lot of the

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:43.376
temples and the worship areas are,

01:24:43.376 --> 01:24:46.908
and there is a small park
there that was across the way.

01:24:46.908 --> 01:24:48.357
LIAM: That may be something useful.

01:24:48.357 --> 01:24:49.595
It's a red brick building.

01:24:49.595 --> 01:24:50.727
It stands out against a lot of it,

01:24:50.727 --> 01:24:52.089
because it was built specifically

01:24:52.089 --> 01:24:53.898
to kind of be the small, gnomish hovel

01:24:53.898 --> 01:24:56.838
that was built buy his own hands.

01:24:56.838 --> 01:24:59.121
So when attacking, right, once you've

01:24:59.121 --> 01:25:02.368
given up your position,
it loses its worth.

01:25:02.368 --> 01:25:04.326
So my suggestion would be that we move

01:25:04.326 --> 01:25:07.740
to approach from another vantage point, or

01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:12.158
we can just kick this
thing off and I walk in.

01:25:12.158 --> 01:25:13.682
I'm fine either way.

01:25:13.682 --> 01:25:14.515
MARISHA: All right, well...

01:25:14.515 --> 01:25:17.416
Are we nearby a sewer system?

01:25:17.416 --> 01:25:18.299
Scanlan, do you know?

01:25:18.299 --> 01:25:21.335
Oh, I happen to know exactly
where a sewer system is.

01:25:21.335 --> 01:25:24.168
We can try and sewer cross town.

01:25:25.483 --> 01:25:27.900
Or we can just walk right in.

01:25:29.262 --> 01:25:30.730
SAM: Where are we trying to get?

01:25:30.730 --> 01:25:32.218
LAURA: To the center of town.

01:25:32.218 --> 01:25:33.729
TRAVIS: We thought about seeing if maybe

01:25:33.729 --> 01:25:36.116
we could get to Wilhand's house.

01:25:36.116 --> 01:25:38.237
SAM: Where is that, and
why would we be there?

01:25:38.237 --> 01:25:41.673
Well, that's Pike's grandfather.

01:25:41.673 --> 01:25:44.580
So I know, but does that provide us

01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:47.353
with some strategic advantage?

01:25:47.353 --> 01:25:50.236
No, but we might be able
to see if he's all right.

01:25:50.236 --> 01:25:51.916
They've probably dragged
him to the center of town.

01:25:51.916 --> 01:25:52.893
How can we get through this?

01:25:52.893 --> 01:25:54.143
Go ahead, Pike.

01:25:55.708 --> 01:25:57.035
We could go to the center of town

01:25:57.035 --> 01:25:59.618
and check to see if he's there.

01:26:00.650 --> 01:26:03.400
After we take care of business...

01:26:04.491 --> 01:26:06.481
And then hopefully he's not there.

01:26:06.481 --> 01:26:10.307
I mean, he could provide a lot of help.

01:26:10.307 --> 01:26:12.888
LAURA: Maybe we go to his house first.

01:26:12.888 --> 01:26:13.769
He's your grandfather.

01:26:13.769 --> 01:26:15.768
TRAVIS: If we go to the center of town -

01:26:15.768 --> 01:26:16.601
LAURA: It's all going down.

01:26:16.601 --> 01:26:17.623
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:26:17.623 --> 01:26:21.130
MARISHA: How do we get out of this with the most -

01:26:21.130 --> 01:26:24.941
or sorry, with the least
civilian casualties, Grog?

01:26:24.941 --> 01:26:27.544
TRAVIS: I'm not really thinking that far ahead.

01:26:27.544 --> 01:26:28.681
MARISHA: Sure.

01:26:28.681 --> 01:26:30.753
We were supposed to
also pick something up.

01:26:30.753 --> 01:26:31.711
Yes, a two-story--

01:26:31.711 --> 01:26:32.928
LAURA: We can do that after.

01:26:32.928 --> 01:26:33.890
TALIESIN: Here's the thing.
SAM: Well, wait.

01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:35.732
The thing might help us, who knows?

01:26:35.732 --> 01:26:37.813
It was a red brick two-story home--

01:26:37.813 --> 01:26:38.646
SAM: Near the fountain.

01:26:38.646 --> 01:26:39.479
Dark wood.

01:26:39.479 --> 01:26:40.539
Wait--

01:26:40.539 --> 01:26:41.997
Near the fountain crossroads.

01:26:41.997 --> 01:26:45.184
TALIESIN: Pike, do you know this house?

01:26:45.184 --> 01:26:48.138
Doesn't that sound like the house that--

01:26:48.138 --> 01:26:49.195
That's Wilhand's house.

01:26:49.195 --> 01:26:50.324
Wilhand's house is on the--

01:26:50.324 --> 01:26:52.365
in the temple district stands out

01:26:52.365 --> 01:26:54.385
because it's a small little,
like, red brick area.

01:26:54.385 --> 01:26:55.705
The one that he's talking about is more of

01:26:55.705 --> 01:26:58.546
a classic kind of dark wood
with red brick outside,

01:26:58.546 --> 01:26:59.670
like the way he described it was

01:26:59.670 --> 01:27:00.928
it's very colonial-style, but like with

01:27:00.928 --> 01:27:02.904
a brick base built around it.

01:27:02.904 --> 01:27:03.737
Is that not the leader of,

01:27:03.737 --> 01:27:05.706
the guy that runs the Westruun--

01:27:05.706 --> 01:27:07.308
That was Master Quall's house.

01:27:07.308 --> 01:27:08.141
Master Quall.

01:27:08.141 --> 01:27:09.387
Master Quall was just the master.

01:27:09.387 --> 01:27:10.751
He's his own little--

01:27:10.751 --> 01:27:11.604
TRAVIS: That's not that house.

01:27:11.604 --> 01:27:12.437
No.

01:27:12.437 --> 01:27:14.138
The Margrave's house is the
one that's in the town square,

01:27:14.138 --> 01:27:15.481
and that's where Kevdak apparently has

01:27:15.481 --> 01:27:17.384
taken as his homestead.

01:27:17.384 --> 01:27:18.754
Right, and that's not the description.

01:27:18.754 --> 01:27:22.321
So we have to start this
now, are we prepared?

01:27:22.321 --> 01:27:24.704
There are pluses and
minuses to both thoughts.

01:27:24.704 --> 01:27:27.299
They have a bunch of innocent people

01:27:27.299 --> 01:27:29.143
who they may just start killing.

01:27:29.143 --> 01:27:30.512
Here's my question.

01:27:30.512 --> 01:27:34.679
If we wait, will they ever,
theoretically, let them go?

01:27:35.698 --> 01:27:37.732
Or is it easier to just
slit their throats?

01:27:37.732 --> 01:27:38.565
TRAVIS: No.

01:27:38.565 --> 01:27:40.051
Then we shouldn't wait.

01:27:40.051 --> 01:27:41.273
TALIESIN: We shouldn't wait.

01:27:41.273 --> 01:27:42.420
We shouldn't wait.

01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:43.547
Then we just do it.

01:27:43.547 --> 01:27:44.890
Those of us with distance, we make,

01:27:44.890 --> 01:27:47.386
we find positions around the square.

01:27:47.386 --> 01:27:48.219
LAURA: We stealth around.

01:27:48.219 --> 01:27:49.342
The second we start attacking,

01:27:49.342 --> 01:27:50.655
they will start killing, so...

01:27:50.655 --> 01:27:54.437
He walks in on his own,
challenges Kevdak to a duel.

01:27:54.437 --> 01:27:55.270
Yeah, look--

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:56.103
On your own?

01:27:56.103 --> 01:27:57.270
So it'll go like this.

01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:58.845
Everybody get high vantage points,

01:27:58.845 --> 01:28:01.103
so I walk in, I'm pretty
sure if I call him out

01:28:01.103 --> 01:28:04.577
he'll step aside and we'll do this thing.

01:28:04.577 --> 01:28:08.744
If it starts going poorly, I
leave it to your discretion.

01:28:09.895 --> 01:28:11.448
Or if other people start getting iffy

01:28:11.448 --> 01:28:15.281
with the civilians, we
can start taking shots.

01:28:17.636 --> 01:28:19.897
I know I can drop a few
before they do anything.

01:28:19.897 --> 01:28:22.314
I've burned both of my wild

01:28:23.476 --> 01:28:25.987
shaping abilities for right now.

01:28:25.987 --> 01:28:27.100
Unless we wanted to take

01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:29.447
a brief rest to regain our thoughts.

01:28:29.447 --> 01:28:30.686
This is sort of a brief rest.

01:28:30.686 --> 01:28:32.676
Is this considered, like, a short rest?

01:28:32.676 --> 01:28:34.117
No, a short rest is like a half an hour

01:28:34.117 --> 01:28:35.739
to an hour of, like, intentional--

01:28:35.739 --> 01:28:37.824
We can afford it, we can take that.

01:28:37.824 --> 01:28:38.706
MARISHA: A half hour?

01:28:38.706 --> 01:28:39.843
Will they start killing people?

01:28:39.843 --> 01:28:41.073
TALIESIN: Not in half an hour.

01:28:41.073 --> 01:28:42.506
TRAVIS: No, they won't do it for no reason.

01:28:43.339 --> 01:28:44.527
They don't even know where we are.

01:28:44.527 --> 01:28:49.519
MARISHA: Yeah, 30 minutes is nothing
in a hostage situation.

01:28:49.519 --> 01:28:50.624
TRAVIS: Take a short rest if you want to.

01:28:50.624 --> 01:28:51.702
All right, let's take a short rest

01:28:51.702 --> 01:28:53.155
and we'll finish fleshing out this plan.

01:28:53.155 --> 01:28:53.988
MATT: Okay.

01:28:53.988 --> 01:28:55.084
MARISHA: Does anyone else need to heal up?

01:28:55.084 --> 01:28:56.101
TALIESIN: I'm good.

01:28:56.101 --> 01:28:56.934
MARISHA: I wanna burn a hit dice.

01:28:56.934 --> 01:28:57.767
LAURA: I am too.

01:28:57.767 --> 01:29:01.441
LAURA: I don't want
you to waste any spells.

01:29:01.441 --> 01:29:02.280
Save it.

01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:03.298
I can use a hit die.

01:29:03.298 --> 01:29:05.159
The Margrave house, when they were

01:29:05.159 --> 01:29:06.803
flying over in mist
form, there was something

01:29:06.803 --> 01:29:08.375
that looked like it was red and

01:29:08.375 --> 01:29:10.742
smeared on the outside of the walls.

01:29:10.742 --> 01:29:11.818
Was that the Margrave house?

01:29:11.818 --> 01:29:12.651
Yeah.

01:29:12.651 --> 01:29:13.832
SAM: Are we close
to the edge of town?

01:29:13.832 --> 01:29:17.082
About, like, a five, six minute walk.

01:29:20.681 --> 01:29:22.591
A brisk jog, I should say.

01:29:22.591 --> 01:29:26.424
It's close, but it's
not, like, right outside.

01:29:27.474 --> 01:29:28.307
SAM: Okay.

01:29:30.558 --> 01:29:32.785
TALIESIN: That's what I would say is my plan,

01:29:32.785 --> 01:29:33.632
if you feel like walking,

01:29:33.632 --> 01:29:35.858
we can point guard you from a distance

01:29:35.858 --> 01:29:39.337
and make sure if anyone tries to attack.

01:29:39.337 --> 01:29:42.471
MARISHA: Well, we should try and probably

01:29:42.471 --> 01:29:44.769
have a few people on
civilian duty as well,

01:29:44.769 --> 01:29:46.351
kind of like we did before.

01:29:46.351 --> 01:29:48.473
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:29:48.473 --> 01:29:52.587
That would be perfect,
if you're willing to...

01:29:52.587 --> 01:29:53.901
No, that's, that can't,

01:29:53.901 --> 01:29:56.944
you don't still have the house
that you can summon, do you?

01:29:56.944 --> 01:29:58.173
Of course I do.

01:29:58.173 --> 01:29:59.620
Can we put that door somewhere and start

01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:01.229
sending people, if we
liberate them, to it?

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:03.030
Of course we can.

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:04.632
However, it would have to be somewhere

01:30:04.632 --> 01:30:06.440
close to where the hostages are.

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:09.294
They would definitely see their hostages

01:30:09.294 --> 01:30:11.416
jumping into a magical hole--

01:30:11.416 --> 01:30:15.310
We could put your magical
hole inside of a building

01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:16.682
and send people into the building

01:30:16.682 --> 01:30:19.015
so that it's got, like, double cover.

01:30:19.015 --> 01:30:20.533
And if anyone finds your magical hole,

01:30:20.533 --> 01:30:22.773
they can jump in it, or do
they have to have permission?

01:30:22.773 --> 01:30:24.653
By the way, so many jokes, so many jokes.

01:30:24.653 --> 01:30:27.267
(laughing)

01:30:27.267 --> 01:30:28.139
Resisting.

01:30:28.139 --> 01:30:30.205
You're being very good.

01:30:30.205 --> 01:30:31.440
Very firm on this one.

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:34.773
What happens if you lure a Goliath and orc

01:30:34.773 --> 01:30:38.990
into the magical hole, do
they get stuck in there?

01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:42.208
I imagine they'll have
a lovely chicken dinner.

01:30:42.208 --> 01:30:44.402
Yeah, 'cause after 24
hours, they get kicked out.

01:30:44.402 --> 01:30:45.769
LAURA: They can leave when they want.

01:30:45.769 --> 01:30:47.495
They can come and go as they please,

01:30:47.495 --> 01:30:48.692
so it's not like a roach motel.

01:30:48.692 --> 01:30:50.264
No.

01:30:51.476 --> 01:30:52.874
Vex can capture one of them.

01:30:52.874 --> 01:30:54.207
LAURA: I can.

01:30:55.257 --> 01:30:57.064
(sighs)

01:30:57.064 --> 01:30:59.652
TALIESIN: That's good to know.

01:30:59.652 --> 01:31:00.544
MARISHA: Okay.

01:31:00.544 --> 01:31:02.756
If we know the city this
well, how far would you say

01:31:02.756 --> 01:31:05.359
is Wilhand's place from where we are now?

01:31:05.359 --> 01:31:07.281
I'd say it's about...

01:31:07.281 --> 01:31:08.430
TRAVIS: Mile and a half?

01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:10.964
Yeah, about a 20, 25 minute walk north

01:31:10.964 --> 01:31:13.681
from where you are right now.

01:31:13.681 --> 01:31:15.431
It's a little ways...

01:31:17.274 --> 01:31:21.107
A little ways west of
Noja's old store, and...

01:31:24.068 --> 01:31:26.705
Yeah, it's about 25 minutes.

01:31:26.705 --> 01:31:30.872
Would you like to go first
and see if he's there?

01:31:38.136 --> 01:31:40.454
ASHLEY: It's choosing between
the people in town or--

01:31:40.454 --> 01:31:41.981
TALIESIN: You don't have to.

01:31:41.981 --> 01:31:44.666
You can send a couple
of us to go check in.

01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:46.249
I grab the stone.

01:31:47.519 --> 01:31:48.772
Go check, come back--

01:31:48.772 --> 01:31:49.605
SAM: Wait.

01:31:49.605 --> 01:31:51.887
I'm sorry, but we need Pike with us.

01:31:51.887 --> 01:31:52.739
TALIESIN: She can go check,

01:31:52.739 --> 01:31:54.301
and she'll be back within 60 seconds.

01:31:54.301 --> 01:31:56.914
She has to get there,
she's the worst at stealth.

01:31:56.914 --> 01:31:58.906
That's very fair.

01:31:58.906 --> 01:32:01.324
But we can send someone
and have them right back.

01:32:01.324 --> 01:32:02.907
I mean, it's not...

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:06.877
What if she, what if we
go there and we find him,

01:32:06.877 --> 01:32:09.404
and then what, you can
pop back, but he's alone?

01:32:09.404 --> 01:32:11.185
You can't pop two people
back with the stone.

01:32:11.185 --> 01:32:12.018
I'll go.

01:32:12.018 --> 01:32:13.368
I can pop us back.

01:32:13.368 --> 01:32:15.836
We can send him back, and
then I can get back on my own.

01:32:15.836 --> 01:32:17.888
You don't know where you're going.

01:32:17.888 --> 01:32:20.465
Pike, can you tell me how to get there?

01:32:20.465 --> 01:32:21.298
Yes.

01:32:23.942 --> 01:32:26.122
I've walked city streets that
I've never been in before.

01:32:26.122 --> 01:32:27.474
We can start getting into our positions

01:32:27.474 --> 01:32:30.159
and then when you're done,
you can join one of us.

01:32:30.159 --> 01:32:31.997
What's gonna be the benefit of finding him

01:32:31.997 --> 01:32:34.270
before the fight, as opposed to after?

01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:35.103
That's fair.

01:32:35.103 --> 01:32:36.665
Well, unless they're holding him.

01:32:36.665 --> 01:32:37.863
Unless they're holding him.

01:32:37.863 --> 01:32:38.699
But they wouldn't be holding him,

01:32:38.699 --> 01:32:39.576
because they don't expect us,

01:32:39.576 --> 01:32:40.661
they don't know it's us that's coming.

01:32:40.661 --> 01:32:42.900
Well, then he's either safe in his house,

01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:45.182
or he's in the middle of the town square.

01:32:45.182 --> 01:32:46.015
Either of which--

01:32:46.015 --> 01:32:46.848
She has a fair point.

01:32:46.848 --> 01:32:47.704
TRAVIS: I'm good either way.

01:32:47.704 --> 01:32:48.537
We're okay.

01:32:48.537 --> 01:32:49.405
Well, so if we cut off the head

01:32:49.405 --> 01:32:51.988
of the snake, there's no issue.

01:32:53.048 --> 01:32:53.881
(sighs)

01:32:53.881 --> 01:32:54.811
Let's do it, let's go towards--

01:32:54.811 --> 01:32:57.030
And he is a very powerful
cleric, if we do find him.

01:32:57.030 --> 01:33:00.660
So it would be nice to
have some extra help.

01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:02.015
He may already be there.

01:33:02.015 --> 01:33:06.044
And if he's, I feel
like we should go town,

01:33:06.044 --> 01:33:09.195
because that's a lot more
people than one person.

01:33:09.195 --> 01:33:12.005
Is his house near where
we're going, or no?

01:33:12.005 --> 01:33:12.838
TRAVIS: No.

01:33:12.838 --> 01:33:13.872
It's a wide arc, you
have to go up and over

01:33:13.872 --> 01:33:15.504
to get to the center of town.

01:33:15.504 --> 01:33:17.358
The center of town's
not, like, right center.

01:33:17.358 --> 01:33:19.117
It's kind of, like, north center.

01:33:19.117 --> 01:33:21.893
I mean, I could mist there, and I could

01:33:21.893 --> 01:33:23.985
do something to get there faster.

01:33:23.985 --> 01:33:24.965
No, we're gonna need--

01:33:24.965 --> 01:33:25.867
TRAVIS: You don't need to.

01:33:25.867 --> 01:33:26.751
ASHLEY: We need your spells.

01:33:26.751 --> 01:33:29.418
Yeah, don't waste your spells.

01:33:30.632 --> 01:33:33.721
Look, let's just face this,
wish each other good luck,

01:33:33.721 --> 01:33:36.813
and we'll meet in the middle.

01:33:36.813 --> 01:33:40.713
Are we going to flank
the entire city center?

01:33:40.713 --> 01:33:43.601
We're going to make this, it's
a town square, if I recall.

01:33:43.601 --> 01:33:45.531
There's like a, they've got a barricade.

01:33:45.531 --> 01:33:47.581
Correct me if I'm wrong.

01:33:47.581 --> 01:33:48.741
They've got a section of the city,

01:33:48.741 --> 01:33:50.299
of the town, barricaded off.

01:33:50.299 --> 01:33:51.192
Well, it's not so much a barricade

01:33:51.192 --> 01:33:53.235
more than they have
short little barricades

01:33:53.235 --> 01:33:54.808
built in for, like, anti-cavalry

01:33:54.808 --> 01:33:58.699
and for any large, like,
siege attempts or...

01:33:58.699 --> 01:34:02.074
So we can slowly, we can
start to surround it.

01:34:02.074 --> 01:34:03.742
We can be stealthy and singular,
we can keep in contact.

01:34:03.742 --> 01:34:06.267
I can use Earth Elemental
to glide and literally

01:34:06.267 --> 01:34:10.373
pop out right in the center
of town and avoid everything.

01:34:10.373 --> 01:34:11.282
You could walk right in.

01:34:11.282 --> 01:34:12.115
But you don't want them to see you.

01:34:12.115 --> 01:34:13.098
I would be underground.

01:34:13.098 --> 01:34:15.457
Yeah, I just plan to walk right in.

01:34:15.457 --> 01:34:16.910
And Grog, when you fight this person,

01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:19.465
if he agrees to this one-on-one combat,

01:34:19.465 --> 01:34:22.132
is it gonna be fists or a sword?

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.753
I have no idea.

01:34:24.753 --> 01:34:26.286
(laughing)

01:34:26.286 --> 01:34:27.590
Grog, I guess my one concern is

01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:29.353
what's stopping them from slitting

01:34:29.353 --> 01:34:33.042
all of these people's throats
at any drop of a second?

01:34:33.042 --> 01:34:34.709
A warrior's honor.

01:34:35.714 --> 01:34:36.977
A warrior's honor?

01:34:36.977 --> 01:34:39.418
That's weird, but good enough for me.

01:34:39.418 --> 01:34:42.470
And do you think you can evoke that?

01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:43.887
I guarantee it.

01:34:45.839 --> 01:34:46.958
Men's Warehouse.

01:34:46.958 --> 01:34:49.208
(laughing)

01:34:51.099 --> 01:34:53.414
Just crazy enough for it to work.

01:34:53.414 --> 01:34:54.882
ASHLEY: You're gonna like the way you look!

01:34:54.882 --> 01:34:56.299
I guarantee it!

01:34:56.299 --> 01:34:58.062
(laughing)

01:34:59.669 --> 01:35:00.502
Okay.

01:35:01.552 --> 01:35:03.579
I leave it up to your artistic influences

01:35:03.579 --> 01:35:05.327
on where you go from here.

01:35:05.327 --> 01:35:08.427
Don't be afraid to call your
friends if you need help.

01:35:08.427 --> 01:35:09.442
If I'm Earth Elemental, I won't be able

01:35:09.442 --> 01:35:11.826
to speak, so I'll be relying on you.

01:35:11.826 --> 01:35:12.659
You'll be hearing on me.

01:35:12.659 --> 01:35:14.046
I'll be hearing on you.

01:35:14.046 --> 01:35:15.385
MARISHA: I'm gonna go--

01:35:15.385 --> 01:35:16.856
I'm gonna stay with Grog.

01:35:16.856 --> 01:35:18.170
Okay.

01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:19.968
Are you guys bee lining
it, like straight through--

01:35:19.968 --> 01:35:20.927
No, I was gonna say--

01:35:20.927 --> 01:35:22.758
MATT: Or are you, like,
arcing past Noja's place,

01:35:22.758 --> 01:35:23.622
or are you going--

01:35:23.622 --> 01:35:24.455
Yeah.

01:35:24.455 --> 01:35:25.332
MATT: What's your plan?

01:35:25.332 --> 01:35:26.821
Are we going for the element of surprise?

01:35:26.821 --> 01:35:28.863
Would it be better for
me to Earth Elemental

01:35:28.863 --> 01:35:30.702
and blast out in the
middle, or would it be

01:35:30.702 --> 01:35:33.380
better for me to flank
with the rest of you?

01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:35.596
It's gonna go south if Kevdak

01:35:35.596 --> 01:35:37.927
sees any of us pop out of the windows.

01:35:37.927 --> 01:35:39.964
I think that Grog's right,
he needs to go in alone.

01:35:39.964 --> 01:35:40.927
We need to be hidden--

01:35:40.927 --> 01:35:42.816
We need to flank and
be completely stealthy.

01:35:42.816 --> 01:35:43.655
Okay.

01:35:43.655 --> 01:35:46.026
And if shit goes south, then we go in.

01:35:46.026 --> 01:35:46.859
Okay.

01:35:46.859 --> 01:35:50.942
Is there anything we can
give Grog to help him?

01:35:52.392 --> 01:35:53.960
SAM: Can't you bless him or something?

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:55.279
TRAVIS: I do have a question.

01:35:55.279 --> 01:35:56.696
MATT: Yeah?

01:35:58.337 --> 01:36:00.670
I can enhance his ability.

01:36:01.808 --> 01:36:02.791
TRAVIS: Nah, never mind.

01:36:02.791 --> 01:36:04.213
Are you attuned out, maybe?

01:36:04.213 --> 01:36:05.399
MARISHA: What were you gonna say?

01:36:05.399 --> 01:36:07.059
Yeah, I was gonna see
if I should switch out

01:36:07.059 --> 01:36:10.716
the Gauntlets of Ogre Strength
for these Braces of Defense

01:36:10.716 --> 01:36:12.832
that give me +2 to my
AC, but if I wear that,

01:36:12.832 --> 01:36:15.749
then it takes out my natural armor.

01:36:17.165 --> 01:36:17.998
What about--

01:36:17.998 --> 01:36:20.665
No, it's not considered armor.

01:36:21.813 --> 01:36:22.802
Not actually wearing armor, it's designed

01:36:22.802 --> 01:36:24.698
for somebody who does not, so...

01:36:24.698 --> 01:36:26.133
LIAM: Grog.
LAURA: Well, that's good.

01:36:26.133 --> 01:36:26.966
Grog!

01:36:26.966 --> 01:36:30.007
What if I lend you my boots?

01:36:30.007 --> 01:36:32.288
Which, when you put your heels together,

01:36:32.288 --> 01:36:34.341
will also help your armor out a bit,

01:36:34.341 --> 01:36:37.503
or help your chances of being hit.

01:36:37.503 --> 01:36:38.854
Helps me attack faster.

01:36:38.854 --> 01:36:41.240
You can give them back to me tomorrow.

01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:43.676
And I can give you enhanced constitution.

01:36:43.676 --> 01:36:44.509
No.

01:36:44.509 --> 01:36:45.342
No.

01:36:46.855 --> 01:36:49.137
I've learned that my
strength is with my friends

01:36:49.137 --> 01:36:51.116
and my friends have their own strengths.

01:36:51.116 --> 01:36:52.616
To each their own.

01:36:53.630 --> 01:36:58.401
I don't want you all
handicapping yourself for me.

01:36:58.401 --> 01:37:00.487
I would like to change out

01:37:00.487 --> 01:37:04.089
my Braces of Defense to get a +2 to my AC

01:37:04.089 --> 01:37:05.827
for the Gauntlets of Ogre Strength.

01:37:05.827 --> 01:37:06.766
Okay.

01:37:06.766 --> 01:37:08.132
So your strength is now a 17.

01:37:08.132 --> 01:37:09.342
You take a +2--

01:37:09.342 --> 01:37:10.682
TRAVIS: The AC goes to 21.

01:37:10.682 --> 01:37:11.743
MATT: Correct.

01:37:11.743 --> 01:37:12.576
Okay.

01:37:13.897 --> 01:37:17.730
Because it goes to 17, my modifier is +3.

01:37:18.828 --> 01:37:20.985
Would you like some extra
strength for your...

01:37:20.985 --> 01:37:25.152
Yes, remember, Grog, that
mine and Scanlan's strengths

01:37:26.076 --> 01:37:28.777
are in helping the rest of our

01:37:28.777 --> 01:37:31.277
friends and our fellow allies.

01:37:32.436 --> 01:37:36.234
So we can grant you enhanced abilities.

01:37:36.234 --> 01:37:37.572
Do you have to do it now?

01:37:37.572 --> 01:37:40.686
I would much rather you
just did it on your own

01:37:40.686 --> 01:37:42.667
and maybe not tell me about it.

01:37:42.667 --> 01:37:44.705
MARISHA: Well, I could
do it ahead of time--

01:37:44.705 --> 01:37:45.788
Just do it!

01:37:47.019 --> 01:37:49.602
LIAM: Ix-nay on the elp-hay.

01:37:50.657 --> 01:37:51.907
Just hug him.

01:37:54.681 --> 01:37:56.187
Just hug him!

01:37:56.187 --> 01:37:57.203
TALIESIN: I push her towards him.

01:37:57.203 --> 01:37:58.204
Give him a hug for good luck.

01:37:58.204 --> 01:37:59.046
MARISHA: Grog?

01:37:59.046 --> 01:38:00.371
Oh, shit, what is this?

01:38:00.371 --> 01:38:01.579
MARISHA: Grog.
TRAVIS: Hello.

01:38:01.579 --> 01:38:03.327
We believe in you.

01:38:03.327 --> 01:38:04.160
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:08.327
And I cast enhanced ability,
and I give him enhanced,

01:38:14.597 --> 01:38:17.262
or I could get him, like...

01:38:17.262 --> 01:38:20.556
I'm gonna give him Bear's Endurance,

01:38:20.556 --> 01:38:24.131
which gives him advantage
on constitution checks

01:38:24.131 --> 01:38:27.780
and he gains an additional
2d6 temporary hit points.

01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:28.690
Okay.

01:38:28.690 --> 01:38:30.523
Go ahead and roll 2d6.

01:38:31.477 --> 01:38:32.310
Me?

01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:33.313
MATT: Yep.

01:38:33.313 --> 01:38:34.869
Big money, no whammies!

01:38:34.869 --> 01:38:36.580
That's not great, 6.

01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:37.617
You have 6 temporary hit points,

01:38:37.617 --> 01:38:40.121
and you have advantage
on constitution checks.

01:38:40.121 --> 01:38:41.756
Advantage on constitution--

01:38:41.756 --> 01:38:42.604
MATT: Not saving throws.

01:38:42.604 --> 01:38:43.632
Constitution checks.

01:38:43.632 --> 01:38:44.725
Checks, okay.

01:38:44.725 --> 01:38:46.501
MATT: There are no skills
that are constitution-based.

01:38:46.501 --> 01:38:48.862
Would it have been better to do strength?

01:38:48.862 --> 01:38:50.257
MATT: When he rages, he gets

01:38:50.257 --> 01:38:51.601
advantage on strength anyway.

01:38:51.601 --> 01:38:53.153
Oh, he already gets advantage on strength.

01:38:53.153 --> 01:38:53.986
Okay.

01:38:53.986 --> 01:38:54.928
He'll be okay.

01:38:54.928 --> 01:38:56.959
MATT: But, you know, if it comes up.

01:38:56.959 --> 01:38:59.288
Well, now that we're done
being all touchy-feely

01:38:59.288 --> 01:39:00.934
or whatever the hell that was--

01:39:00.934 --> 01:39:02.730
SAM: Well, wait, wait, wait.

01:39:02.730 --> 01:39:03.563
Oh, Jesus.

01:39:03.563 --> 01:39:07.730
So wait, sorry, it's just,
I found this old joke book,

01:39:09.691 --> 01:39:13.090
I thought you might wanna hear this joke.

01:39:13.090 --> 01:39:14.088
And I pull out my...

01:39:14.088 --> 01:39:15.729
(laughing)

01:39:15.729 --> 01:39:17.862
Bull strength scroll.

01:39:17.862 --> 01:39:18.782
Oh, thank god.

01:39:18.782 --> 01:39:22.445
And I'm gonna read him
the bull strength scroll.

01:39:22.445 --> 01:39:24.853
Can I affect him with the +5 strength?

01:39:24.853 --> 01:39:28.270
Well, the bull strength, as an ability,

01:39:30.099 --> 01:39:31.954
just gives him advantage on
strength, which he already has.

01:39:31.954 --> 01:39:32.787
Oh!

01:39:32.787 --> 01:39:34.845
I thought it was a +5 to strength, no?

01:39:34.845 --> 01:39:35.678
You must've pulled those stats

01:39:35.678 --> 01:39:36.681
out of the old Pathfinder game.

01:39:36.681 --> 01:39:38.052
Oh.

01:39:38.052 --> 01:39:39.845
I have had this for a long time.

01:39:39.845 --> 01:39:42.756
Well then, in that case, I'll just,

01:39:42.756 --> 01:39:45.605
I'll sing you a rousing
song to put you on your way!

01:39:45.605 --> 01:39:46.618
(clears throat)

01:39:46.618 --> 01:39:48.469
â™« The stars at night

01:39:48.469 --> 01:39:49.876
â™« Are big and bright

01:39:49.876 --> 01:39:50.709
(clapping)

01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:53.237
â™« Deep in the beard of Strongjaw â™«

01:39:53.237 --> 01:39:55.487
(laughing)

01:39:57.949 --> 01:39:59.587
Take your d10.

01:39:59.587 --> 01:40:00.563
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:40:00.563 --> 01:40:02.883
I'm going to cast Aid.

01:40:02.883 --> 01:40:03.951
MATT: Okay, and at what level?

01:40:03.951 --> 01:40:06.321
I'm gonna do fourth level.

01:40:06.321 --> 01:40:07.154
MATT: Okay.

01:40:07.154 --> 01:40:09.408
And I'm gonna cast it,
I can cast it on three.

01:40:09.408 --> 01:40:12.165
MATT: Three people, for +15.

01:40:12.165 --> 01:40:13.415
+15.

01:40:13.415 --> 01:40:15.903
MATT: Who else do you choose?

01:40:15.903 --> 01:40:17.653
So I will choose...

01:40:19.108 --> 01:40:19.941
Vex.

01:40:24.262 --> 01:40:26.190
Scanlan, how many hit points are you?

01:40:26.190 --> 01:40:27.560
How many hits points do you have?

01:40:28.568 --> 01:40:29.401
Uh...

01:40:31.036 --> 01:40:31.869
I'm okay.

01:40:31.869 --> 01:40:32.908
One of these two.

01:40:32.908 --> 01:40:34.001
Never worry about me.

01:40:34.001 --> 01:40:35.317
Does it stack with Grog?

01:40:35.317 --> 01:40:36.854
Get Scanlan, Scanlan goes in combat a lot.

01:40:36.854 --> 01:40:37.945
SAM: Never worry about me.

01:40:37.945 --> 01:40:39.215
You can't do it multiple times.

01:40:39.215 --> 01:40:40.421
Scanlan?

01:40:40.421 --> 01:40:41.980
SAM: Yes, my love.

01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:43.780
I would like to aid you as well.

01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:48.317
I really, I don't need, I
don't need any help, I'm fine.

01:40:48.317 --> 01:40:50.175
MARISHA: Just shut up
and take it, Scanlan.

01:40:50.175 --> 01:40:51.829
SAM: Is there some sort of--

01:40:51.829 --> 01:40:52.662
Too late!

01:40:52.662 --> 01:40:53.496
Is there some sort of ritual

01:40:53.496 --> 01:40:56.512
that we need to do together
to make this happen?

01:40:56.512 --> 01:40:57.587
ASHLEY: This happened so fast.

01:40:57.587 --> 01:40:59.837
(laughing)

01:41:01.950 --> 01:41:02.910
MATT: And as she says that,

01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:04.823
there's a blast of warm
light across your chest

01:41:04.823 --> 01:41:07.140
that fades as she has
already turned around.

01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:09.467
However, Vex, Grog, and Scanlan, you guys,

01:41:09.467 --> 01:41:13.679
your maximum hit points
are increased by 15.

01:41:13.679 --> 01:41:15.280
And you get those 15 extra hit points

01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:16.614
for the next eight hours.

01:41:16.614 --> 01:41:17.447
SAM: Great.
LAURA: Nice!

01:41:17.447 --> 01:41:18.909
Not concentration.

01:41:18.909 --> 01:41:21.492
Anything else you want to cast?

01:41:25.997 --> 01:41:27.277
No.

01:41:27.277 --> 01:41:28.244
MATT: No?

01:41:28.244 --> 01:41:29.077
Okay.

01:41:29.077 --> 01:41:31.868
I tap Grog on the
shoulder and I flash him.

01:41:31.868 --> 01:41:33.305
(laughing)

01:41:33.305 --> 01:41:34.604
Go get it, soldier!

01:41:34.604 --> 01:41:36.930
TRAVIS: I can't lose!

01:41:36.930 --> 01:41:37.173
SAM: Wait, wait, wait!

01:41:37.173 --> 01:41:38.548
(laughing)

01:41:38.548 --> 01:41:39.661
Don't you dare die happy.

01:41:39.661 --> 01:41:41.291
Didn't we just talk about this?

01:41:41.291 --> 01:41:42.124
What?

01:41:42.124 --> 01:41:43.518
Give him the fucking rock!

01:41:43.518 --> 01:41:45.489
The rock that he can
bamf out of there with!

01:41:45.489 --> 01:41:46.322
It takes a minute.

01:41:46.322 --> 01:41:47.155
So?

01:41:47.155 --> 01:41:47.988
It's something.

01:41:47.988 --> 01:41:48.821
A minute's a long time.

01:41:48.821 --> 01:41:49.654
Oh, all right, forget it!

01:41:49.654 --> 01:41:51.033
I reach into my Bag of Holding

01:41:51.033 --> 01:41:54.366
and I pull out my trusty salt lick rock,

01:41:56.515 --> 01:41:58.003
and I kneel down to Pike.

01:41:58.003 --> 01:42:02.209
I say, "Hey, hold this for me, all right?"

01:42:02.209 --> 01:42:03.042
Okay.

01:42:03.042 --> 01:42:04.111
Yeah.

01:42:04.111 --> 01:42:05.998
Just keep it safe, I don't
like getting blood on it.

01:42:05.998 --> 01:42:07.113
But listen.

01:42:07.113 --> 01:42:09.606
I can't lose you twice in one day, okay?

01:42:09.606 --> 01:42:12.291
Oh, no, I'm not going anywhere.

01:42:12.291 --> 01:42:14.399
We're just going to meet
some really bad folks

01:42:14.399 --> 01:42:17.814
and we're gonna set 'em straight.

01:42:17.814 --> 01:42:18.697
Okay.

01:42:18.697 --> 01:42:21.082
(laughing)

01:42:21.082 --> 01:42:22.318
Go get 'em, okay?

01:42:22.318 --> 01:42:24.616
MARISHA: That was the cutest thing!

01:42:24.616 --> 01:42:26.149
Now, I walk out.

01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:27.477
Oh, God, no!

01:42:27.477 --> 01:42:28.345
Are you guys following behind,

01:42:28.345 --> 01:42:29.235
or just letting him do his thing?

01:42:29.235 --> 01:42:30.489
We stealth, like--

01:42:30.489 --> 01:42:32.239
We watch him leave.

01:42:33.555 --> 01:42:34.565
MATT: Okay.

01:42:34.565 --> 01:42:35.821
ASHLEY: I cast Pass
Without a Trace on him.

01:42:35.821 --> 01:42:36.654
And then we stealth.

01:42:36.654 --> 01:42:38.960
Any other last-minute things
you're gonna help Grog with?

01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:39.793
Or are we done?

01:42:39.793 --> 01:42:40.626
TRAVIS: We're good.

01:42:40.626 --> 01:42:41.459
Okay.

01:42:41.459 --> 01:42:42.292
Everyone's good?

01:42:42.292 --> 01:42:43.125
MARISHA: He's pretty stacked.

01:42:43.125 --> 01:42:43.958
Okay.

01:42:43.958 --> 01:42:44.791
LAURA: Ish.

01:42:44.791 --> 01:42:46.586
ASHLEY: We can stay close
to him, though, right?

01:42:46.586 --> 01:42:47.708
I like that we managed to make,

01:42:47.708 --> 01:42:48.841
like, solving problems with violence

01:42:48.841 --> 01:42:51.586
into an ABC afternoon special, really.

01:42:51.586 --> 01:42:52.419
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

01:42:52.419 --> 01:42:54.069
Remarkable.

01:42:54.069 --> 01:42:54.902
Uh, okay.

01:42:57.364 --> 01:42:58.316
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on us

01:42:58.316 --> 01:42:59.207
so we can stealth.

01:42:59.207 --> 01:43:00.040
All right.

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:04.757
So, the rest of you, go ahead
and make your stealth check.

01:43:04.757 --> 01:43:05.590
MARISHA: Ooh!

01:43:08.682 --> 01:43:09.515
MATT: Which direction are you

01:43:09.515 --> 01:43:12.026
traveling, Grog, by the way?

01:43:12.026 --> 01:43:14.741
I guess just towards the heart of town.

01:43:14.741 --> 01:43:15.936
Just beelining it straight to the center?

01:43:15.936 --> 01:43:16.769
GROG: Not stopping.

01:43:16.769 --> 01:43:17.602
Okay.

01:43:17.602 --> 01:43:19.075
All righty.

01:43:19.075 --> 01:43:20.075
So, stealth?

01:43:21.748 --> 01:43:22.597
ASHLEY: 14.

01:43:22.597 --> 01:43:23.868
SAM: Oh my god!
MATT: With the ten?

01:43:23.868 --> 01:43:24.701
What's that?

01:43:24.701 --> 01:43:25.779
MATT: Plus ten.

01:43:25.779 --> 01:43:26.881
Oh!

01:43:26.881 --> 01:43:27.759
Then, 24!

01:43:27.759 --> 01:43:28.995
SAM: Thank God.
LAURA: What?

01:43:28.995 --> 01:43:30.177
LAURA: 29.
LIAM: 39.

01:43:30.177 --> 01:43:32.147
MARISHA: 33.
TALIESIN: 34.

01:43:32.147 --> 01:43:33.120
21.

01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:34.014
All right.

01:43:34.014 --> 01:43:38.359
Grog is not going stealthy, or
are you just walking through?

01:43:38.359 --> 01:43:39.488
TRAVIS: Just walking through.

01:43:39.488 --> 01:43:41.001
All right.

01:43:41.001 --> 01:43:43.270
TALIESIN: (hums exciting music)

01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:45.781
MATT: As you guys follow suit,
dodging from alley to alley,

01:43:45.781 --> 01:43:47.665
Grog, you step into the main roadway--

01:43:47.665 --> 01:43:49.412
okay, you want rooftop?

01:43:49.412 --> 01:43:50.433
You and Percy?

01:43:50.433 --> 01:43:52.605
LAURA: Percy, are you
going to the rooftop?

01:43:52.605 --> 01:43:54.785
All right, both of you
guys roll acrobatics checks,

01:43:54.785 --> 01:43:58.202
we'll just say as a continuation of this.

01:44:01.404 --> 01:44:02.237
Natural one?

01:44:02.237 --> 01:44:03.406
ASHLEY: No, that was a seven.

01:44:03.406 --> 01:44:04.367
Was it?

01:44:04.367 --> 01:44:05.374
Yeah.

01:44:05.374 --> 01:44:07.659
No, I think it was a one!

01:44:07.659 --> 01:44:08.865
(laughing)

01:44:08.865 --> 01:44:09.802
MATT: Nice try.

01:44:09.802 --> 01:44:10.867
That thing was so--

01:44:10.867 --> 01:44:11.700
(laughing)

01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:13.054
LAURA: It might have been a seven,
but I thought it was a one.

01:44:13.054 --> 01:44:17.221
Well, regardless, you guys
get but 30 feet before

01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:20.856
(thud)

01:44:20.856 --> 01:44:23.106
(laughing)

01:44:24.521 --> 01:44:25.590
Vex, you suffer eight points of damage

01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:26.823
as you plummet off--

01:44:26.823 --> 01:44:27.656
LAURA: Come on!
MATT: Of this,

01:44:27.656 --> 01:44:29.532
the second-story buildings, and land--

01:44:29.532 --> 01:44:31.143
I have a broom to get
up to the top, you know!

01:44:31.143 --> 01:44:32.873
I know, and unfortunately, your foot

01:44:32.873 --> 01:44:34.790
found one of those loose shingles,

01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:36.098
and you lost your grip

01:44:36.098 --> 01:44:38.271
on the broom,
tumbled, landed,

01:44:38.271 --> 01:44:41.098
at which your broom then (thud)

01:44:41.098 --> 01:44:42.982
about two feet in front
of you on the ground.

01:44:42.982 --> 01:44:43.990
I caught it.

01:44:43.990 --> 01:44:44.823
I didn't want it to--

01:44:44.823 --> 01:44:46.323
SAM: You are the shadow
that stalks the guilty.

01:44:46.323 --> 01:44:48.573
(laughing)

01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:51.686
MATT: So you kind of look over

01:44:51.686 --> 01:44:52.603
your shoulder for a second.

01:44:52.603 --> 01:44:54.436
Keep marching forward.

01:44:56.570 --> 01:44:59.903
You get about four blocks before you see

01:45:01.551 --> 01:45:05.662
a group of four individuals,
no Goliaths among them.

01:45:05.662 --> 01:45:08.800
It appears to be two
humans, a male and a female,

01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:11.300
and one elf, and one halfling.

01:45:13.387 --> 01:45:17.554
They're all smeared and muddy
streaks across the face.

01:45:19.529 --> 01:45:22.780
The halfling has their
head completely shaved off

01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:24.163
and it has the two kind of lined scars

01:45:24.163 --> 01:45:27.110
over the top of the face
to the back of the head.

01:45:27.110 --> 01:45:30.796
They all turn the corner
and look over at you.

01:45:30.796 --> 01:45:34.939
Take a moment to kind of look
for any sort of recognition.

01:45:34.939 --> 01:45:35.881
They look at each other and begin

01:45:35.881 --> 01:45:37.914
to walk forward, drawing their weapons.

01:45:38.747 --> 01:45:41.756
Oh, lads, lads, no need for that.

01:45:41.756 --> 01:45:44.115
I've traveled quite a long way.

01:45:44.115 --> 01:45:47.255
See, I'm part of a
ranging party for Kevdak.

01:45:47.255 --> 01:45:49.508
It's very important that I see him.

01:45:49.508 --> 01:45:51.341
You see, we're family.

01:45:52.345 --> 01:45:54.788
Now, you can either take me to him,

01:45:54.788 --> 01:45:56.871
or I can drag you to him.

01:45:59.245 --> 01:46:02.099
The elf kind of steps forward
and pushes the others away.

01:46:02.099 --> 01:46:04.998
Draws these two thin short
swords from the side,

01:46:04.998 --> 01:46:06.743
they look kind of jagged and chipped

01:46:06.743 --> 01:46:08.969
like they've seen quite a few battles.

01:46:08.969 --> 01:46:12.170
Leans forward and kind
of puts one eye on you,

01:46:12.170 --> 01:46:15.742
leaning on the side as he approaches.

01:46:15.742 --> 01:46:17.159
"Kevdak, you say?

01:46:18.607 --> 01:46:20.024
"Family, you say?

01:46:20.958 --> 01:46:21.967
"I've not seen your face,

01:46:21.967 --> 01:46:25.566
"nor the travels you've had with the herd.

01:46:25.566 --> 01:46:27.316
"But you say family."

01:46:29.601 --> 01:46:32.101
Don't make me repeat myself.

01:46:34.861 --> 01:46:37.028
Make a persuasion check.

01:46:39.381 --> 01:46:40.640
(gasps)

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:41.488
Natural 20!

01:46:41.488 --> 01:46:43.738
(laughing)

01:46:46.601 --> 01:46:50.189
The others behind draw their weapons,

01:46:50.189 --> 01:46:51.518
one of them pulls out this, like,

01:46:51.518 --> 01:46:53.302
long nasty double-headed great ax

01:46:53.302 --> 01:46:55.433
and kind of lets it down to the side

01:46:55.433 --> 01:46:56.788
and begins to step forward.

01:46:56.788 --> 01:46:59.953
The halfling draws this
gnarled spiked whip,

01:46:59.953 --> 01:47:02.297
then kind of like cracks it on the ground,

01:47:02.297 --> 01:47:03.566
begins stepping forward.

01:47:03.566 --> 01:47:06.020
The female to the left of the elf

01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:08.912
goes ahead and draws
this long, thin rapier

01:47:08.912 --> 01:47:10.757
that almost has, like, a curve to it

01:47:10.757 --> 01:47:12.604
and begins to point it forward

01:47:12.604 --> 01:47:14.315
as the elf takes the two blades and

01:47:14.315 --> 01:47:16.077
puts it out and stops the rest of them.

01:47:16.077 --> 01:47:19.244
He goes, "All right, family of Kevdak.

01:47:22.155 --> 01:47:24.643
"If you're lying, it'll
be fun to watch you scream

01:47:24.643 --> 01:47:27.869
"as he tears the head from you.

01:47:27.869 --> 01:47:29.536
"Walk to the front."

01:47:32.377 --> 01:47:33.627
Lead the way.

01:47:35.075 --> 01:47:36.908
"Walk to the front."

01:47:39.302 --> 01:47:41.730
And I walk past them to the front.

01:47:41.730 --> 01:47:42.563
All right.

01:47:42.563 --> 01:47:43.656
The four of them flank behind you,

01:47:43.656 --> 01:47:45.514
blades still drawn, and just slowly walk

01:47:45.514 --> 01:47:48.240
about ten feet to your--

01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:52.290
Now I ask you, as I was
approaching this city,

01:47:52.290 --> 01:47:54.845
I saw a dragon fly over.

01:47:54.845 --> 01:47:57.419
Picked up one who looked
just like me and flew away.

01:47:57.419 --> 01:48:01.002
What's it like being
the bitch of a dragon?

01:48:03.848 --> 01:48:05.331
There's a long pause as you keep walking.

01:48:05.331 --> 01:48:08.914
And the same elven
voice pipes up and goes,

01:48:10.018 --> 01:48:13.020
"Well, I imagine the gnashing teeth

01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:16.590
"of such a beast would
be comparably painful

01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:19.363
"as the gnashing tips of these blades

01:48:19.363 --> 01:48:23.113
"if you don't shut your
mouth, Goliath scum."

01:48:26.275 --> 01:48:27.237
You'll be feeling the tips of those

01:48:27.237 --> 01:48:31.154
before I feel the tips
of any teeth of dragons.

01:48:32.781 --> 01:48:34.952
(laughing)

01:48:34.952 --> 01:48:36.732
"Oh, there's many a teeth waiting for you

01:48:36.732 --> 01:48:39.428
"where you walk, friend.

01:48:39.428 --> 01:48:40.428
"Keep going.

01:48:42.037 --> 01:48:44.287
"Your insolence amuses me."

01:48:46.250 --> 01:48:47.498
As you guys are kind of keeping back,

01:48:47.498 --> 01:48:49.622
I need everyone to make
another stealth check.

01:48:49.622 --> 01:48:53.789
LIAM: That guy tortures
small animals, by the way.

01:48:55.927 --> 01:48:57.479
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

01:48:57.479 --> 01:48:59.102
Oh, 21.

01:48:59.102 --> 01:48:59.935
24.

01:49:02.225 --> 01:49:03.349
39.

01:49:03.349 --> 01:49:04.205
12?

01:49:04.205 --> 01:49:05.038
Plus 10?

01:49:05.038 --> 01:49:05.871
Yeah.

01:49:05.871 --> 01:49:07.788
SAM: Ooh, that's our girl!

01:49:08.901 --> 01:49:09.734
37.

01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:12.959
All right.

01:49:12.959 --> 01:49:16.245
As you guys are stalking behind,

01:49:16.245 --> 01:49:17.456
there's a moment where you all

01:49:17.456 --> 01:49:19.313
duck into one of the alleyways

01:49:19.313 --> 01:49:21.924
and as Pike spins into the alley,

01:49:21.924 --> 01:49:23.369
the edge of her shoulder armor,

01:49:23.369 --> 01:49:25.379
being wider than her actual form,

01:49:25.379 --> 01:49:26.890
catches the edge of the building,

01:49:26.890 --> 01:49:29.001
causing this large (clang) sound.

01:49:29.001 --> 01:49:32.336
The sound of bending metal
clanging against itself.

01:49:32.336 --> 01:49:35.229
At which point, the troop behind

01:49:35.229 --> 01:49:37.729
Grog immediately spins around.

01:49:39.107 --> 01:49:40.690
"Did you hear that?

01:49:43.530 --> 01:49:44.633
"Is anyone following us?"

01:49:44.633 --> 01:49:46.270
And as you've kind of
kept walking forward,

01:49:46.270 --> 01:49:47.821
you feel the point of a blade just kind of

01:49:47.821 --> 01:49:50.325
gently press into your lower back.

01:49:50.325 --> 01:49:52.992
Good lord, you're awful jumpy.

01:49:54.598 --> 01:49:57.598
See, when I was last with this herd,

01:49:59.061 --> 01:50:01.143
the mates that I ran around with

01:50:01.143 --> 01:50:02.820
weren't so quick to jump and hide

01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:05.807
behind their mother's skirts.

01:50:05.807 --> 01:50:08.161
Keep your attention focused on me, son.

01:50:08.161 --> 01:50:12.132
We've got important dealings to meet with.

01:50:12.132 --> 01:50:13.382
Keep walking.

01:50:14.272 --> 01:50:16.230
The blade pulls back.

01:50:16.230 --> 01:50:17.803
As you continue to step forward,

01:50:17.803 --> 01:50:20.842
you hear a little whisper behind you.

01:50:20.842 --> 01:50:21.967
And you kind of glance over and look

01:50:21.967 --> 01:50:24.908
as the halfling and the female

01:50:24.908 --> 01:50:26.557
with the kind of hooked rapier

01:50:26.557 --> 01:50:27.791
both break off and begin heading

01:50:27.791 --> 01:50:29.898
back towards the alleyway.

01:50:29.898 --> 01:50:30.731
LAURA: Perfect.

01:50:30.731 --> 01:50:32.314
SAM: No problem.

01:50:33.284 --> 01:50:34.649
So, as you guys step forward,

01:50:34.649 --> 01:50:36.181
you guys now lurking in the alley

01:50:36.181 --> 01:50:37.817
kind of pull off into the shadow.

01:50:37.817 --> 01:50:41.092
Listening, you hear very,
very light footsteps

01:50:41.092 --> 01:50:43.324
beginning to find their
way in your direction.

01:50:43.324 --> 01:50:44.888
Can we wait until they
come around the corner?

01:50:44.888 --> 01:50:46.345
I'm gonna continue--

01:50:46.345 --> 01:50:49.864
I'm gonna continue following Grog just--

01:50:49.864 --> 01:50:51.240
Are we gonna wait and jump them?

01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:52.223
Or do you want me to stop them?

01:50:52.223 --> 01:50:53.157
We're all split, right?

01:50:53.157 --> 01:50:54.095
You guys are all,

01:50:54.095 --> 01:50:57.015
are you guys divided
into different groups?

01:50:57.015 --> 01:50:57.856
SAM: No, we're all together.

01:50:57.856 --> 01:50:58.995
You're on a roof, you're on a--

01:50:58.995 --> 01:51:01.158
No, I'm not on a roof,
I fell off the roof.

01:51:01.158 --> 01:51:01.991
I'm on a roof.

01:51:01.991 --> 01:51:03.127
MATT: Yeah, Percy's up on a roof.

01:51:03.127 --> 01:51:03.960
I'm letting them know -

01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:06.131
I didn't want to interrupt that

01:51:06.131 --> 01:51:07.524
because it was fabulous, but...

01:51:07.524 --> 01:51:09.811
I've been trying to, like, keep everybody

01:51:09.811 --> 01:51:11.022
informed of what I've been seeing

01:51:11.022 --> 01:51:12.482
and just like, "two splitting off,

01:51:12.482 --> 01:51:14.112
they're heading towards there."

01:51:14.112 --> 01:51:14.945
I'm gonna continue with Grog.

01:51:14.945 --> 01:51:15.865
I think we should lie in wait

01:51:15.865 --> 01:51:17.235
until they come around
the corner, and then--

01:51:17.235 --> 01:51:18.068
(mimics choking sound)

01:51:18.068 --> 01:51:19.257
I'll count them down
when they turn around.

01:51:19.257 --> 01:51:21.955
Okay, I'll wait to shoot an arrow

01:51:21.955 --> 01:51:23.826
until they come around the corner.

01:51:23.826 --> 01:51:24.659
Okay.

01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:26.762
TALIESIN: Two of them?

01:51:26.762 --> 01:51:28.526
Two of them, yes.

01:51:28.526 --> 01:51:29.759
TALIESIN: Two of them taking a turn--

01:51:29.759 --> 01:51:31.127
MATT: I've described them, yeah.

01:51:31.127 --> 01:51:32.952
I prep a Hold Person spell.

01:51:32.952 --> 01:51:35.429
Ready for when they turn the corner.

01:51:35.429 --> 01:51:36.262
MATT: All right.

01:51:36.262 --> 01:51:37.095
Now!

01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:39.757
At this point, you now see the halfling

01:51:39.757 --> 01:51:43.139
kind of darts around,
whip out on the side

01:51:43.139 --> 01:51:44.820
as the elf turns around the corner,

01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:47.139
rapier out with
her hand in front of her.

01:51:47.139 --> 01:51:47.972
What are you guys doing?

01:51:47.972 --> 01:51:49.663
I wanna grab the elf and slit her throat.

01:51:49.663 --> 01:51:50.583
(laughing)

01:51:50.583 --> 01:51:51.838
I'm shooting at the halfling.

01:51:51.838 --> 01:51:53.176
Two arrows at the halfling.

01:51:53.176 --> 01:51:54.042
MATT: Okay.

01:51:54.042 --> 01:51:57.487
I go for, you said you
were taking the elf?

01:51:57.487 --> 01:51:58.320
LIAM: Yeah.

01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.094
I'm gonna go for the elf
and cast Hold Person.

01:52:00.094 --> 01:52:00.927
Okay.

01:52:00.927 --> 01:52:03.319
Uh, we'll say for the sake of you two,

01:52:03.319 --> 01:52:05.402
you both roll initiative.

01:52:08.883 --> 01:52:10.008
14.

01:52:10.008 --> 01:52:10.994
14.

01:52:10.994 --> 01:52:11.943
MATT: Okay.

01:52:11.943 --> 01:52:13.071
You go ahead and make your attack first.

01:52:13.071 --> 01:52:13.904
Okay.

01:52:13.904 --> 01:52:14.768
This is a surprise round.

01:52:14.768 --> 01:52:15.601
They don't expect to see you dart

01:52:15.601 --> 01:52:16.850
out of the side of the shadows.

01:52:16.850 --> 01:52:19.779
They're facing downward into the alley.

01:52:19.779 --> 01:52:20.862
Okay, uh...

01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:26.134
I'm going to use Luck,
my last luck of the day.

01:52:26.134 --> 01:52:26.967
Okay.

01:52:26.967 --> 01:52:28.967
Oh, this attack, uh, 16.

01:52:30.044 --> 01:52:31.205
16, then?

01:52:31.205 --> 01:52:32.886
Uh, yeah, that--

01:52:32.886 --> 01:52:35.322
No, that's attack, that's a 21.

01:52:35.322 --> 01:52:36.476
21, thanks.

01:52:36.476 --> 01:52:37.700
MATT: Hits either way.

01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:38.533
Go for it.

01:52:38.533 --> 01:52:39.366
Uh...

01:52:42.392 --> 01:52:43.834
I don't want to be heard!

01:52:43.834 --> 01:52:46.157
(laughing)

01:52:46.157 --> 01:52:47.907
7, 9, 10, 20, 30, 66.

01:52:54.349 --> 01:52:55.182
TRAVIS: Jesus.

01:52:55.182 --> 01:52:57.761
You grab her, pull her back, draw
the blade across the throat.

01:52:57.761 --> 01:53:02.334
With a slight muffling sound,
she begins to bleed out.

01:53:02.334 --> 01:53:05.299
Still fighting and
tensing against your body.

01:53:05.299 --> 01:53:08.180
Seeing that, I'll switch
my spell to the halfling.

01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:09.864
(laughing)

01:53:09.864 --> 01:53:12.217
Not necessary on the elf anymore.

01:53:12.217 --> 01:53:14.126
LIAM: Do I still have
the bonus action left?

01:53:14.126 --> 01:53:15.441
MATT: I'd say so.

01:53:15.441 --> 01:53:16.895
Yeah, I wanna shove that in her chest.

01:53:16.895 --> 01:53:18.662
MATT: Okay.

01:53:18.662 --> 01:53:19.622
Oh, Jesus.

01:53:19.622 --> 01:53:21.039
Uh, that is 27.

01:53:21.930 --> 01:53:23.390
MATT: That hits.

01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:25.057
And that is eight.

01:53:25.924 --> 01:53:27.488
MATT: Eight damage?

01:53:27.488 --> 01:53:30.488
Plus all that poison to it, DC 15.

01:53:32.306 --> 01:53:33.680
With a seven, no.

01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:35.597
Okay, so she takes...

01:53:36.877 --> 01:53:38.210
An additional...

01:53:39.822 --> 01:53:41.930
12 points of poison damage.

01:53:41.930 --> 01:53:43.798
With that, the blade pulses as

01:53:43.798 --> 01:53:46.516
the poison filters into the bloodstream

01:53:46.516 --> 01:53:49.422
through the sternum
where the blade pierced.

01:53:49.422 --> 01:53:51.002
As you quietly hold her in place,

01:53:51.002 --> 01:53:53.307
she goes still and goes,

01:53:53.307 --> 01:53:55.466
Yeah, goes limp in your arms.

01:53:55.466 --> 01:53:56.587
You, however, at this point, turn

01:53:56.587 --> 01:53:58.268
and cast Hold Person on the halfling?

01:53:58.268 --> 01:53:59.101
Yeah.

01:53:59.101 --> 01:54:00.831
The halfling sees you jump out

01:54:00.831 --> 01:54:03.128
and just whisks her out of the alleyway,

01:54:03.128 --> 01:54:04.860
turns in that direction, and before

01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:06.510
it has a chance to react, as it pulls back

01:54:06.510 --> 01:54:07.952
with the whip to go in that direction,

01:54:07.952 --> 01:54:09.952
(noise)

01:54:10.984 --> 01:54:13.231
it just stays there, frozen in place.

01:54:13.231 --> 01:54:14.364
That's when I release my arrows.

01:54:14.364 --> 01:54:15.197
MATT: Go for it.

01:54:15.197 --> 01:54:16.973
MARISHA: Go, go.

01:54:16.973 --> 01:54:18.260
MATT: You have advantage on these shots

01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:20.307
because the entity currently cannot -

01:54:20.307 --> 01:54:22.857
Eight, no, 28 for the first hit.

01:54:22.857 --> 01:54:23.690
28 for the first hit?

01:54:23.690 --> 01:54:24.970
Are you going, like, right up against it,

01:54:24.970 --> 01:54:26.097
or is this from a distance?

01:54:26.097 --> 01:54:27.106
This is from a distance.

01:54:27.106 --> 01:54:28.092
Okay.

01:54:28.092 --> 01:54:29.175
So that hits.

01:54:31.183 --> 01:54:32.961
Uh, 29 for the second hit.

01:54:32.961 --> 01:54:34.628
Both of those hit.

01:54:35.776 --> 01:54:37.531
And I want to Hunter's
Mark, can I Hunter's Mark?

01:54:37.531 --> 01:54:38.364
Too late?

01:54:38.364 --> 01:54:39.371
Can I Hunter's Mark it?

01:54:39.371 --> 01:54:40.591
I'll say sure.

01:54:40.591 --> 01:54:42.195
LAURA: All right.

01:54:42.195 --> 01:54:45.112
TALIESIN: There was a countdown.

01:54:51.385 --> 01:54:52.596
18...

01:54:52.596 --> 01:54:56.351
24 for the first hit,
no, 22 for the first hit.

01:54:56.351 --> 01:54:57.768
MATT: Okay.

01:55:00.881 --> 01:55:01.714
And...

01:55:04.342 --> 01:55:05.175
God, I can't add.

01:55:05.175 --> 01:55:06.754
18 for the second hit.

01:55:06.754 --> 01:55:08.073
Okay.

01:55:08.073 --> 01:55:11.573
So, both, you know, just a beat of impact,

01:55:12.609 --> 01:55:14.706
the body tenses in place, and you see

01:55:14.706 --> 01:55:16.074
a bit of red begin to drip out

01:55:16.074 --> 01:55:17.641
of the corner of the
mouth of the halfling.

01:55:17.641 --> 01:55:19.236
However, it's still kind of

01:55:19.236 --> 01:55:20.590
eyes darting around wildly,
trying to figure out

01:55:20.590 --> 01:55:23.173
what the hell is happening.

01:55:23.173 --> 01:55:24.252
Scanlan, Pike, anything?

01:55:24.252 --> 01:55:26.790
Can I run up and grab
the whip out of her hand?

01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:27.623
(laughing)

01:55:27.623 --> 01:55:28.456
MATT: His?

01:55:28.456 --> 01:55:29.289
Yes, you can.

01:55:29.289 --> 01:55:30.122
Oh, his hand.

01:55:30.122 --> 01:55:30.955
His hand, so sorry.

01:55:30.955 --> 01:55:32.618
No, the female has been, by uh...

01:55:32.618 --> 01:55:34.729
Hard to see, halfling with that much mud.

01:55:34.729 --> 01:55:37.831
You go over and quickly
wedge the whip out of

01:55:37.831 --> 01:55:40.248
the halfling's hand, no issue.

01:55:42.570 --> 01:55:43.502
Alright, Scanlan, anything?

01:55:43.502 --> 01:55:46.033
That's all I can do, right?

01:55:46.033 --> 01:55:47.870
MATT: It's pretty quick, it's pretty easy,

01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:49.770
it would be like an action.

01:55:49.770 --> 01:55:50.726
What do you want to do?

01:55:50.726 --> 01:55:52.893
I'd like to use my mace.

01:55:54.357 --> 01:55:56.110
Which I'll allow because
he's not defending anything,

01:55:56.110 --> 01:55:57.338
it's just like a bonus action.

01:55:57.338 --> 01:55:58.671
I say go for it.

01:56:01.843 --> 01:56:03.843
Advantage on the attack.

01:56:07.470 --> 01:56:08.303
OK, 16.

01:56:09.154 --> 01:56:10.471
16 hits.

01:56:10.471 --> 01:56:11.346
LAURA: Nice.

01:56:11.346 --> 01:56:14.139
ASHLEY: Alright, alright!

01:56:14.139 --> 01:56:15.937
MATT: Because it is a
melee against a currently

01:56:15.937 --> 01:56:20.104
paralyzed individual, it is
considered a critical hit.

01:56:22.661 --> 01:56:23.494
Nice!

01:56:28.957 --> 01:56:29.831
18.

01:56:29.831 --> 01:56:31.064
So double the dice.

01:56:31.064 --> 01:56:34.360
And then add the bonus on top of it.

01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:35.234
23.

01:56:35.234 --> 01:56:36.151
23, nice.

01:56:37.612 --> 01:56:40.851
So as you pull the whip out with one hand,

01:56:40.851 --> 01:56:44.735
you crack the mace right into
the face of the halfling.

01:56:44.735 --> 01:56:46.900
To the point where you hit
and you have to kind of like

01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:49.011
get the elbow lift to pull it free.

01:56:49.011 --> 01:56:51.261
(laughter)

01:56:54.474 --> 01:56:56.849
Face is kinda caving a little
bit, Ninja Scroll style.

01:56:56.849 --> 01:56:58.107
And he's kind of like twitching.

01:56:58.107 --> 01:56:59.440
Still conscious.

01:57:00.378 --> 01:57:03.768
No, that's awful make it unconscious.

01:57:03.768 --> 01:57:04.601
MATT: Not yet.

01:57:04.601 --> 01:57:07.599
We have to sit through that.

01:57:07.599 --> 01:57:08.432
ASHLEY: Sorry.

01:57:10.595 --> 01:57:13.002
Cannot make any of these
saves for the life of itself.

01:57:13.002 --> 01:57:13.876
SAM: Can I attack?

01:57:13.876 --> 01:57:15.749
You can now, yes.

01:57:15.749 --> 01:57:17.746
I will use the Myth Carver.

01:57:17.746 --> 01:57:18.629
Oh, wow.

01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:19.503
Oh my God.

01:57:19.503 --> 01:57:20.378
Has this happened before?

01:57:20.378 --> 01:57:21.363
No, we just got this.

01:57:21.363 --> 01:57:23.708
I don't even know what, I
think I'm going to need help.

01:57:23.708 --> 01:57:24.677
Okay, let me help you.

01:57:24.677 --> 01:57:26.670
This is why we're here.

01:57:26.670 --> 01:57:28.847
Okay, roll an attack.

01:57:28.847 --> 01:57:30.453
Okay.

01:57:30.453 --> 01:57:31.327
You got this.

01:57:31.327 --> 01:57:32.452
I don't know how to--

01:57:32.452 --> 01:57:33.484
Use the die.

01:57:33.484 --> 01:57:36.591
Okay, I'm gonna hold the
sword, and I fumble with it,

01:57:36.591 --> 01:57:39.523
hold it up again, and then close my eyes

01:57:39.523 --> 01:57:41.174
and just kinda go like this.

01:57:41.174 --> 01:57:42.639
Okay, so the attack gives you advantage,

01:57:42.639 --> 01:57:44.134
but the blindness gives you disadvantage,

01:57:44.134 --> 01:57:46.371
so just roll an attack.

01:57:46.371 --> 01:57:47.391
Plus, eight.

01:57:47.391 --> 01:57:48.808
12, plus eight?

01:57:49.912 --> 01:57:50.820
MATT: So you get 20, that hits.

01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:52.089
Go ahead and roll damage.

01:57:52.089 --> 01:57:53.341
And it's a critical hit.

01:57:53.341 --> 01:57:55.253
One d8, so it's
two d8 plus three.

01:57:55.253 --> 01:57:56.128
TRAVIS: That's the Myth Carver.

01:57:56.128 --> 01:57:58.028
It's one d8 plus three?

01:57:58.028 --> 01:58:00.013
MATT: It's one d6 sonic
damage, which is also doubled.

01:58:00.013 --> 01:58:01.556
Do I roll twice, or do I just--

01:58:01.556 --> 01:58:03.086
Not double this.

01:58:03.086 --> 01:58:03.983
You roll-

01:58:03.983 --> 01:58:05.688
Twice, you roll two d8.

01:58:05.688 --> 01:58:06.562
SAM: Double, OK.

01:58:06.562 --> 01:58:09.279
Roll once and then, roll d8 and d6,

01:58:09.279 --> 01:58:11.482
double that number, add your bonus.

01:58:11.482 --> 01:58:12.514
It's just that easy.

01:58:12.514 --> 01:58:14.846
Roll a d8 and a d6.

01:58:14.846 --> 01:58:15.830
MATT: The sonic damage.
SAM: That's a six.

01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:17.963
Okay, so that's nine, I double that, 18.

01:58:17.963 --> 01:58:19.643
Plus three.

01:58:19.643 --> 01:58:20.651
Plus three is 21.

01:58:20.651 --> 01:58:21.661
MATT: Okay, 21 points of damage.

01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:23.501
As you fumble the blade and cover your

01:58:23.501 --> 01:58:25.279
eyes as you pull back the blade,

01:58:25.279 --> 01:58:28.199
the slight humming sound (hums),

01:58:28.199 --> 01:58:30.521
the blade actually kind
of vibrates in place

01:58:30.521 --> 01:58:31.601
and as you thrust forward,

01:58:31.601 --> 01:58:35.854
it goes through like
butter with a heated blade.

01:58:35.854 --> 01:58:38.715
You know, you think you missed,

01:58:38.715 --> 01:58:41.095
then you open and peek through your eyes

01:58:41.095 --> 01:58:43.228
and see that you went
straight though his face.

01:58:43.228 --> 01:58:44.673
(laughter)

01:58:44.673 --> 01:58:45.547
GROUP: Oh shit.

01:58:45.547 --> 01:58:46.846
MATT: Like you hit nothing.

01:58:46.846 --> 01:58:48.134
The face, the skull?

01:58:48.134 --> 01:58:49.843
SAM: I didn't mean to, ah, this is...

01:58:49.843 --> 01:58:52.899
You pull it out and it's still kind of

01:58:52.899 --> 01:58:55.275
vibrating a little bit, there
is no blood on the blade,

01:58:55.275 --> 01:58:57.516
the actual like, the sonic
vibrations of the weapon

01:58:57.516 --> 01:58:59.970
managed to shake free any possibility

01:58:59.970 --> 01:59:02.101
of any of the gore sticking to the weapon.

01:59:02.101 --> 01:59:03.252
Oh, that's sick.

01:59:03.252 --> 01:59:04.619
MARISHA: That's so bad ass.

01:59:04.619 --> 01:59:05.493
LAURA: That's pretty cool.

01:59:05.493 --> 01:59:07.347
At which point the spell fades

01:59:07.347 --> 01:59:10.731
as the life force of this
halfling no longer holds sway

01:59:10.731 --> 01:59:13.981
and the body just crumples into a pile.

01:59:16.393 --> 01:59:19.442
MARISHA: All right, onward with our
murdering spree, let's go.

01:59:19.442 --> 01:59:20.630
Wait, wait, are they going to

01:59:20.630 --> 01:59:24.312
know that their two people are gone?

01:59:24.312 --> 01:59:25.184
TALIESIN: Eventually.

01:59:25.184 --> 01:59:26.088
Eventually.

01:59:26.088 --> 01:59:27.603
TALIESIN: What other choices did we have?

01:59:27.603 --> 01:59:29.435
LAURA: Can we loot the bodies?

01:59:29.435 --> 01:59:30.838
Of course you say that.

01:59:30.838 --> 01:59:32.242
Before we move forward.

01:59:32.242 --> 01:59:33.279
MATT: You can if you want to.

01:59:33.279 --> 01:59:34.112
I'll check the elf.

01:59:34.112 --> 01:59:34.945
MATT: It'll take a while.

01:59:34.945 --> 01:59:36.364
I just want to make sure that there's

01:59:36.364 --> 01:59:37.938
nothing super valuable
just sitting on them.

01:59:37.938 --> 01:59:39.622
I'm just gonna, I'm going
to keep talking to them

01:59:39.622 --> 01:59:41.932
to make sure they know what's up,

01:59:41.932 --> 01:59:43.778
so just talking in their ear,

01:59:43.778 --> 01:59:45.181
they're still walking, walking.

01:59:45.181 --> 01:59:46.054
What's going on Percy?

01:59:46.054 --> 01:59:46.887
27.

01:59:47.751 --> 01:59:50.218
27, at a cursory glance, it'll
take you a couple minutes,

01:59:50.218 --> 01:59:53.898
which will put you guys a
little behind Grog's procession

01:59:53.898 --> 01:59:58.077
to do this, but you manage
to find, on the two bodies,

01:59:58.077 --> 02:00:01.494
about 125 gold pieces, 2 relatively dirty

02:00:03.871 --> 02:00:08.038
sets of leather armor, one's
more of a hide actually,

02:00:10.377 --> 02:00:14.825
for the woman who had the
rapier, it's hide armor.

02:00:14.825 --> 02:00:15.992
And that's it.

02:00:17.193 --> 02:00:18.211
LAURA: All right.

02:00:18.211 --> 02:00:19.804
How about on the thing I killed, anything?

02:00:19.804 --> 02:00:20.684
LAURA: You have a whip.

02:00:20.684 --> 02:00:21.559
Oh, they did both?

02:00:21.559 --> 02:00:22.726
MATT: Yeah.

02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:25.627
LAURA: Can I keep the whip?

02:00:25.627 --> 02:00:27.662
If you want to.

02:00:27.662 --> 02:00:29.650
Okay, you take the whip
and wrap it up real fast

02:00:29.650 --> 02:00:32.369
and kind of just attach
it inside of your belt.

02:00:32.369 --> 02:00:33.563
SAM: Kinky.

02:00:33.563 --> 02:00:37.646
Can I have everyone make
another stealth check?

02:00:45.726 --> 02:00:46.766
22.

02:00:46.766 --> 02:00:47.637
30.

02:00:47.637 --> 02:00:48.511
34.

02:00:48.511 --> 02:00:50.303
No, Pass Without a Trace is gone,
you used Hunter's Mark.

02:00:50.303 --> 02:00:52.828
MARISHA: Oh, then 24.
TALIESIN: 24.

02:00:52.828 --> 02:00:54.256
Then 12.

02:00:54.256 --> 02:00:55.152
LIAM: Oh it just burned you.

02:00:55.152 --> 02:00:56.151
LAURA: Oh, it did, it burned.

02:00:56.151 --> 02:00:57.151
LIAM: 29.

02:00:58.411 --> 02:00:59.390
21.

02:00:59.390 --> 02:01:00.223
11.

02:01:01.554 --> 02:01:03.275
Because the extra 10's gone.
LAURA: I'm sorry!

02:01:03.275 --> 02:01:04.858
No, it's all right.

02:01:07.183 --> 02:01:09.324
All right, you guys move
on a little bit further

02:01:09.324 --> 02:01:12.157
towards a T portion of the street,

02:01:14.298 --> 02:01:18.465
where you can now see
there's a cart in the center.

02:01:20.343 --> 02:01:23.920
And what looks to be a
number of other Goliaths

02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:28.503
are currently pulling two
individuals out of their homes

02:01:28.503 --> 02:01:30.857
and kind of starting to
drag them back towards the

02:01:30.857 --> 02:01:33.579
top of the T intersection where
you guys are passing from.

02:01:33.579 --> 02:01:34.651
As you get to that point,

02:01:34.651 --> 02:01:36.529
there's a little bit of
noise coming that way.

02:01:36.529 --> 02:01:39.320
You hear another clank and a shh

02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:42.046
from behind you in an
alley just around the way

02:01:42.046 --> 02:01:45.405
and the elf behind you
has been walking quietly,

02:01:45.405 --> 02:01:48.005
stops and goes, "All rright,
something not right

02:01:48.005 --> 02:01:51.060
"is going on at this moment."

02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:54.477
He turns around, "You hold here Goliath."

02:01:56.683 --> 02:01:59.693
No, I don't think I will.

02:01:59.693 --> 02:02:02.096
But I tell you what, you make the choice.

02:02:02.096 --> 02:02:06.263
Walk me to Kevdak or go check
out your little spook fest.

02:02:15.177 --> 02:02:18.427
He looks over to the other companion,

02:02:19.844 --> 02:02:21.527
"Go ahead and gather those men,

02:02:21.527 --> 02:02:23.501
"have them follow you into the alley."

02:02:23.501 --> 02:02:27.042
Then the other individual
walks towards the alley

02:02:27.042 --> 02:02:28.665
and starts talking to the other goliaths,

02:02:28.665 --> 02:02:30.431
they go ahead and take some of the people

02:02:30.431 --> 02:02:32.267
that they're holding by the arms,

02:02:32.267 --> 02:02:33.811
lift them up over their shoulder,

02:02:33.811 --> 02:02:37.355
and you now have roughly six individuals,

02:02:37.355 --> 02:02:38.433
four of which are goliath,

02:02:38.433 --> 02:02:40.418
now joining up for a total of seven,

02:02:40.418 --> 02:02:41.535
and they're all heading back

02:02:41.535 --> 02:02:42.931
towards the ally way,
TALIESIN: Hostages heading

02:02:42.931 --> 02:02:43.796
towards you just run, just run and hide.

02:02:43.796 --> 02:02:44.639
MATT: Where the noise came from.

02:02:44.639 --> 02:02:46.720
As the elf who continues to
walk forward with you is back.

02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:47.695
TALIESIN: Just run and hide.

02:02:47.695 --> 02:02:48.608
SAM: Do we run?

02:02:48.608 --> 02:02:49.784
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we disappear.

02:02:49.784 --> 02:02:51.020
We disappear.

02:02:51.020 --> 02:02:51.893
We hide.

02:02:51.893 --> 02:02:53.216
Okay.

02:02:53.216 --> 02:02:55.676
You guys begin to vanish,
make one more stealth check

02:02:55.676 --> 02:02:57.327
to see if you leave any tracks behind

02:02:57.327 --> 02:02:59.850
or any followable trace.

02:02:59.850 --> 02:03:01.167
TALIESIN: I'm not with them.

02:03:01.167 --> 02:03:02.852
ASHLEY: Do we still have Pass Without a -

02:03:02.852 --> 02:03:04.136
LAURA: No, I'm sorry.

02:03:04.136 --> 02:03:05.659
Because I'm an asshole.

02:03:09.576 --> 02:03:10.943
MATT: You good?

02:03:10.943 --> 02:03:12.487
Hmm?

02:03:12.487 --> 02:03:14.571
(laughter)

02:03:14.571 --> 02:03:15.444
I got a two.

02:03:15.444 --> 02:03:16.787
Oh no!

02:03:16.787 --> 02:03:18.745
(laughter)

02:03:18.745 --> 02:03:19.864
SAM: She's the worst!

02:03:19.864 --> 02:03:22.972
I hate my armor! And I love it in battle.

02:03:22.972 --> 02:03:25.768
There's a set you never
quite picked up from Gilmore.

02:03:25.768 --> 02:03:26.675
ASHLEY: Fuck.

02:03:26.675 --> 02:03:30.028
You had commissioned an
armor that would be silent,

02:03:30.028 --> 02:03:31.730
but it never got picked up.

02:03:31.730 --> 02:03:32.821
Oh shit.

02:03:32.821 --> 02:03:33.654
What?

02:03:33.654 --> 02:03:34.487
Ages ago, yeah we commissioned.

02:03:34.487 --> 02:03:35.855
Yeah, I was wondering
what happened to that.

02:03:35.855 --> 02:03:37.745
I thought we had it already.

02:03:37.745 --> 02:03:39.598
LIAM: It's buried in rubble now.

02:03:39.598 --> 02:03:40.893
No, maybe he...

02:03:40.893 --> 02:03:42.121
ASHLEY: I totally forgot about that.

02:03:42.121 --> 02:03:43.432
Maybe when he was dying
he took it with him.

02:03:43.432 --> 02:03:44.479
(laughter)

02:03:44.479 --> 02:03:46.649
He's got it all under his arm.

02:03:46.649 --> 02:03:49.336
TALIESIN: Maybe he has a magic
vault, it might be fun.

02:03:49.336 --> 02:03:51.313
That's true, he might have a magic vault.

02:03:51.313 --> 02:03:52.706
I don't know if that's a real thing...

02:03:52.706 --> 02:03:53.661
LAURA: He probably has a magic vault.

02:03:53.661 --> 02:03:54.734
ASHLEY: I do not remember that at all.

02:03:55.007 --> 02:03:58.044
TALIESIN: I just don't
remember that either, so.

02:03:58.044 --> 02:03:58.918
LAURA: Dammit.

02:03:58.918 --> 02:04:00.901
The thought hits you immediately,

02:04:00.901 --> 02:04:02.078
the memory of like, oh that's right!

02:04:02.078 --> 02:04:06.245
As you tumble through
a sequence of small boxes,

02:04:08.911 --> 02:04:10.656
your distraction caught you off guard,

02:04:10.656 --> 02:04:12.327
and you weren't paying attention
where you were walking,

02:04:12.327 --> 02:04:13.786
briefly before you just fall face first

02:04:13.786 --> 02:04:16.890
into kind of a mushy mud puddle.

02:04:16.890 --> 02:04:18.116
And kind of stand up and look.

02:04:18.116 --> 02:04:19.216
TALIESIN: Scanlan, you want
to do anything about this?

02:04:19.216 --> 02:04:20.541
Of course I do.

02:04:20.541 --> 02:04:25.268
I'm going to run up to her
and just hold her by the hand.

02:04:25.268 --> 02:04:27.303
Do they see us at this point?

02:04:27.303 --> 02:04:28.702
They are right around the corner,

02:04:28.702 --> 02:04:30.616
you see shadows beginning
to approach across the road.

02:04:30.616 --> 02:04:33.530
Scanlan, the mansion, open
the mansion in a store.

02:04:33.530 --> 02:04:35.784
He can do whatever he wants,
don't tell him what to do.

02:04:36.657 --> 02:04:38.433
Are they going to see us
if they round the corner?

02:04:38.433 --> 02:04:39.559
Yes.

02:04:39.559 --> 02:04:41.988
I hold her by both hands

02:04:41.988 --> 02:04:45.523
and I Dimension Door us to the rooftop.

02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:48.430
MATT: You've used dimension
door twice now today.

02:04:48.430 --> 02:04:49.773
That's the third.

02:04:49.773 --> 02:04:51.428
MATT: That's your third and
final fourth level spell?

02:04:51.428 --> 02:04:52.302
Yes, correct.

02:04:52.302 --> 02:04:53.473
All righty.

02:04:53.473 --> 02:04:55.221
LIAM: Open the door, do the
top one, do the bottom lock.

02:04:55.221 --> 02:04:56.132
LAURA: Shh.

02:04:56.132 --> 02:04:58.219
TALIESIN: Ix-nay on the argue-jay!

02:04:59.093 --> 02:05:00.833
MATT: As you guys are bickering...

02:05:00.833 --> 02:05:01.707
LAURA: No!

02:05:01.707 --> 02:05:03.790
(laughter)

02:05:03.790 --> 02:05:08.730
Around the corner, the group
steps into the alleyway

02:05:08.730 --> 02:05:12.068
as this little poof of
purple energy and smoke

02:05:12.068 --> 02:05:16.235
quickly dissipates and they
all spin looking to the way,

02:05:18.644 --> 02:05:22.561
they glance about, step
in to begin to inspect.

02:05:26.487 --> 02:05:28.725
Spend a few moments, one
of them goes up to where

02:05:28.725 --> 02:05:31.981
the barrels had fallen
over, just kind of pokes,

02:05:31.981 --> 02:05:36.148
looks into the mud, can see
some depressions in the mud.

02:05:40.165 --> 02:05:44.334
"There's something following us, come on."

02:05:44.334 --> 02:05:45.240
And they all begin to swarm into

02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:47.315
the alleyway, all seven of them.

02:05:47.315 --> 02:05:49.114
You guys, are you going,
are you backing up further

02:05:49.114 --> 02:05:51.895
into the alley, are you
trying, what are you doing?

02:05:51.895 --> 02:05:52.844
LAURA: I'm gonna...

02:05:52.844 --> 02:05:57.011
I'm going to try to parkour
up to the ceiling again,

02:05:57.162 --> 02:05:59.866
up to the rooftops.

02:05:59.866 --> 02:06:01.219
Acrobatics?

02:06:01.219 --> 02:06:02.436
I'm just going to go backwards.

02:06:02.436 --> 02:06:03.503
MATT: Go backwards?

02:06:03.503 --> 02:06:04.864
Away from them.

02:06:04.864 --> 02:06:06.402
MATT: Okay, so heading
backwards into the alley.

02:06:06.402 --> 02:06:07.714
Can I see this happening?

02:06:07.714 --> 02:06:09.328
No, you two are just on the roof,

02:06:09.328 --> 02:06:11.774
and you're kind of like
"Okay."

02:06:11.774 --> 02:06:13.490
You can glance over
and look on the side, if you want to,

02:06:13.490 --> 02:06:15.372
but this'll be the next

02:06:15.372 --> 02:06:17.252
thing you see after they disperse.

02:06:17.252 --> 02:06:18.462
I'm just splitting my attention,

02:06:18.462 --> 02:06:20.396
trying to figure out what to deal with.

02:06:20.396 --> 02:06:23.763
I go air elemental form.

02:06:23.829 --> 02:06:27.959
And into a doorway, into a crack.

02:06:28.450 --> 02:06:32.604
Okay. So elemental form,
you're now kind of this

02:06:32.604 --> 02:06:37.078
little cluster of wind,
just underneath the doorway.

02:06:37.078 --> 02:06:38.767
As they all step in and look about--

02:06:38.767 --> 02:06:39.668
LAURA: I 34'ed up to the--

02:06:39.668 --> 02:06:41.288
MATT: 34'ed up?

02:06:41.288 --> 02:06:42.728
All right, and you backed around the way.

02:06:42.728 --> 02:06:46.462
They step in and begin to
kind of split up a little bit.

02:06:46.462 --> 02:06:48.178
You come back around,

02:06:48.178 --> 02:06:50.790
and you can head back to the thoroughfare,

02:06:50.790 --> 02:06:52.875
and continue to follow or
find them up on the roof.

02:06:52.875 --> 02:06:54.020
What are you going to do?

02:06:54.020 --> 02:06:57.245
I'm going to follow, so I can

02:06:57.245 --> 02:06:58.994
try to see Grog, but stay hidden.

02:06:58.994 --> 02:07:01.336
So you're going to head back onto the road

02:07:01.336 --> 02:07:03.382
and duck between
alleyways on your own?

02:07:03.382 --> 02:07:05.464
Okay, so you can do that
way, kind of essentially,

02:07:05.464 --> 02:07:07.794
tracking back around as they entered,

02:07:07.794 --> 02:07:10.448
and pass them as they're
spreading out into the alleyways.

02:07:10.448 --> 02:07:11.850
Most of you guys are up on the roof now.

02:07:11.850 --> 02:07:16.119
And Keyleth, you just kind of
watch them as they move past

02:07:16.119 --> 02:07:19.032
and eventually just
kind of (imitates wind),

02:07:19.032 --> 02:07:23.199
behind them.
Where do you want to go?

02:07:23.896 --> 02:07:25.004
What?

02:07:25.004 --> 02:07:26.217
MATT: What do you want to do?

02:07:26.217 --> 02:07:27.050
MARISHA: Hiding.

02:07:27.050 --> 02:07:28.418
(laughter)

02:07:28.861 --> 02:07:30.205
They move past and all of you companions

02:07:30.205 --> 02:07:33.203
are currently gone,
you're by yourself hiding

02:07:33.203 --> 02:07:35.650
this big underneath a doorway
in your elemental form,

02:07:35.650 --> 02:07:36.523
what do you want to do?

02:07:36.523 --> 02:07:37.999
They're gone though?

02:07:37.999 --> 02:07:40.528
MATT: They've moved past you,
yeah, they did not notice.

02:07:40.528 --> 02:07:41.800
SAM: They've moved on Keyleth.

02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:43.765
Then I try and find them,

02:07:43.765 --> 02:07:46.037
still in my form, but misting about.

02:07:46.037 --> 02:07:48.865
Okay, so (imitates wind),
this little burst of wind

02:07:48.865 --> 02:07:50.098
that comes up to the rooftop,

02:07:50.098 --> 02:07:52.833
and as you get up there, you
can see a couple roofs over,

02:07:52.833 --> 02:07:54.712
a couple of dots, the
rest of your companions

02:07:54.712 --> 02:07:57.233
that are slowing making
their way along the road.

02:07:57.233 --> 02:07:58.287
MARISHA: Okay, I follow them.

02:07:58.287 --> 02:08:00.323
Okay, you guys make your way.

02:08:00.323 --> 02:08:04.461
TRAVIS: You lot are so funny. You
know, I think I saw something

02:08:04.461 --> 02:08:07.283
running behind that pile
of horse shit over there,

02:08:07.283 --> 02:08:09.212
if you want to check it out, too.

02:08:09.212 --> 02:08:11.462
(laughter)

02:08:13.087 --> 02:08:14.634
Silence, no response.

02:08:14.634 --> 02:08:17.629
MARISHA: Since I'm
already elemental form,

02:08:17.629 --> 02:08:20.728
I'm going to go ahead
and start parting off

02:08:20.728 --> 02:08:22.024
from the rest of the crowd,

02:08:22.024 --> 02:08:23.735
I'm going to flake
around to the other side,

02:08:23.735 --> 02:08:24.996
I'm going to start flanking.

02:08:24.996 --> 02:08:26.599
Okay, so you've got to the other side now.

02:08:26.599 --> 02:08:28.880
The bells have now fully subsided,

02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:30.249
all the various warning bells

02:08:30.249 --> 02:08:31.721
that would go off every few minutes,

02:08:31.721 --> 02:08:33.289
just kind of keeping the
state of awareness going,

02:08:33.289 --> 02:08:36.456
have begun to just dissipate and stop.

02:08:39.936 --> 02:08:43.234
The elf behind you is kind
of glancing back and forth

02:08:43.234 --> 02:08:45.989
over his shoulder, but still
keeps a blade forward.

02:08:45.989 --> 02:08:49.009
You go past that T
intersection, continuing onward

02:08:51.199 --> 02:08:55.122
into the open central square

02:08:56.702 --> 02:09:00.142
on the north portion of the road.

02:09:00.663 --> 02:09:02.369
There's the main central road

02:09:02.369 --> 02:09:03.632
that you guys have been walking

02:09:03.632 --> 02:09:07.702
and it opens up into
brick and cobblestone,

02:09:07.702 --> 02:09:11.869
upward with a slight square
road interfacing the center.

02:09:12.984 --> 02:09:17.067
A series of shops and
tents and on the left side,

02:09:18.885 --> 02:09:23.014
you recall is where Noja's shop once was,

02:09:23.014 --> 02:09:27.181
Abjurist Noja who had saved
you at the First Winter's Veil.

02:09:29.112 --> 02:09:30.315
Not that you guys see this at the moment,

02:09:30.315 --> 02:09:33.563
but you see this
glancing off to the side.

02:09:33.563 --> 02:09:35.032
The door's kind of half open,

02:09:35.032 --> 02:09:36.470
it looks like a window's broken,

02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:39.270
and the inside has probably
been ransacked as well.

02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:42.246
And as you step in you can see that there

02:09:42.246 --> 02:09:44.905
are a number of tents
that are half fallen over,

02:09:44.905 --> 02:09:48.866
carts that are tipped over
with fruit and vegetables

02:09:48.866 --> 02:09:50.989
that have scattered across the floor

02:09:50.989 --> 02:09:53.584
and they've just been left there to rot.

02:09:53.584 --> 02:09:57.404
There are barrels containing,
looks like rain water

02:09:57.404 --> 02:09:58.353
that has gathered over time

02:09:58.353 --> 02:10:02.520
and section after section
of these wedged barricades

02:10:04.090 --> 02:10:07.023
of pieces of wood that
have been jammed into piles

02:10:07.023 --> 02:10:09.606
with giant spikes and pole arms

02:10:10.127 --> 02:10:12.670
that have been jammed in
there as a defensive place

02:10:12.670 --> 02:10:15.394
and just to be an ominous position

02:10:15.394 --> 02:10:18.889
for anyone who attempts to
walk into this vicinity.

02:10:18.889 --> 02:10:21.756
And you see, about every
five or six of these,

02:10:21.756 --> 02:10:23.877
there is a head adorning it,
that has been just kind of

02:10:23.877 --> 02:10:26.377
wedge on, pushed as a warning.

02:10:27.505 --> 02:10:29.303
TRAVIS: Recognize any of those heads?

02:10:29.303 --> 02:10:30.778
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:10:30.778 --> 02:10:31.651
LAURA: Oh God.

02:10:31.864 --> 02:10:33.738
LIAM: I don't want to know the answer.

02:10:33.738 --> 02:10:36.262
SAM: Well, I recognized a couple earlier.

02:10:36.262 --> 02:10:39.548
MARISHA: Yeah, you did, I
don't think you've told us yet.

02:10:39.548 --> 02:10:41.161
Seven.

02:10:41.161 --> 02:10:42.327
Yeah, you glance around a little bit,

02:10:42.327 --> 02:10:44.261
nothing catches your eye,
you're too focused on the goal

02:10:44.261 --> 02:10:46.296
at hand as you step
through each barricade.

02:10:46.296 --> 02:10:48.300
As you go through the first set,

02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:51.522
already you can see
the cluster of goliaths

02:10:51.522 --> 02:10:54.003
and as well as individuals
that step forward

02:10:54.003 --> 02:10:57.836
and are like, "Hey, who
are you bringing here?"

02:10:59.744 --> 02:11:01.413
And the elf behind you says,

02:11:01.413 --> 02:11:04.830
"Apparently a blood relative of Kevdak's."

02:11:06.885 --> 02:11:08.135
"Is this true?"

02:11:08.135 --> 02:11:10.799
And a few of the Goliaths
step forward and say,

02:11:11.779 --> 02:11:13.076
"Oh, I doubt that."

02:11:13.076 --> 02:11:15.658
And the one on the other side says,

02:11:15.658 --> 02:11:19.288
"Blood relative, the
only one is up inside."

02:11:19.288 --> 02:11:22.622
He steps forward
and you see the next Goliath

02:11:22.622 --> 02:11:25.580
that you recognize, this
is one of the older seers,

02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:27.960
who has one eye that is
completely clouded over white

02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:30.953
and is this kind of
swollen, puss filled socket,

02:11:30.953 --> 02:11:34.282
that has been kind of
perpetually infected over time.

02:11:34.282 --> 02:11:35.462
LAURA: Ew.

02:11:35.462 --> 02:11:39.045
He steps forward with this kind of...

02:11:39.045 --> 02:11:42.861
Thick kind of a, almost
like a moss-like crust,

02:11:42.861 --> 02:11:44.990
that just kind of has
gathered under his neck

02:11:44.990 --> 02:11:48.257
and he's called Greenbeard because of this

02:11:48.257 --> 02:11:51.352
weird, whatever
infection or ailment he had

02:11:51.352 --> 02:11:53.994
caused this kind of moss-type material,

02:11:53.994 --> 02:11:56.856
to grow across
his neck and chest area.

02:11:56.856 --> 02:11:59.029
And he kind of comes forward,
using his walking stick,

02:11:59.029 --> 02:12:02.779
this kind of gnarled
branch that he uses and,

02:12:05.567 --> 02:12:08.067
"Is it really you, Strongjaw?"

02:12:09.668 --> 02:12:12.918
I see your eye still serves you well.

02:12:15.353 --> 02:12:17.872
"You know when Zanror told
us that he came across you

02:12:17.872 --> 02:12:22.039
up north, we beat the shit
out of him for being a liar."

02:12:22.873 --> 02:12:24.916
You should have beat the shit out of him

02:12:24.916 --> 02:12:26.678
for being a coward.

02:12:28.148 --> 02:12:30.398
He begged me to let him go.

02:12:31.534 --> 02:12:32.367
"Really?"

02:12:33.665 --> 02:12:36.474
"Well, seems we know at least who's

02:12:36.474 --> 02:12:38.940
caused all the commotion recently."

02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:41.839
"Dead man walking through town by himself

02:12:41.839 --> 02:12:44.492
into the belly of the beast."

02:12:44.492 --> 02:12:46.347
"So, men,

02:12:47.947 --> 02:12:50.017
take his head."

02:12:50.017 --> 02:12:52.845
He steps back as about
seven other Goliaths

02:12:52.845 --> 02:12:56.470
from up behind and two
longbow individuals in the far end

02:12:56.470 --> 02:12:59.236
go ahead and draw arrows and
begin to notch them back.

02:12:59.236 --> 02:13:00.521
I take a beat.

02:13:00.521 --> 02:13:03.271
TRAVIS: Well, it would be such a shame.

02:13:04.408 --> 02:13:06.357
It seems all of you would be missing out

02:13:06.357 --> 02:13:09.257
on the greatest show of your life.

02:13:09.257 --> 02:13:12.880
You see, in this bag,
I carry the very thing

02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:15.797
that will topple the mighty Kevdak.

02:13:17.641 --> 02:13:19.374
You know what I remember?

02:13:19.374 --> 02:13:23.106
I remember a herd that
nations used to part for,

02:13:23.106 --> 02:13:27.074
I remember a herd that towns
used to quake and run from,

02:13:27.074 --> 02:13:31.379
I remember a herd that
was so proud and dangerous,

02:13:31.379 --> 02:13:35.347
they would never hole up in
a shit-stick city like this.

02:13:35.347 --> 02:13:37.789
But what do I see when I come here?

02:13:37.789 --> 02:13:41.398
Kevdak prancing up in a place like this

02:13:41.398 --> 02:13:45.457
and what, bending the knee to a dragon?

02:13:45.457 --> 02:13:47.457
How far you have fallen.

02:13:48.988 --> 02:13:52.405
Now, if you have any honor in you at all,

02:13:54.309 --> 02:13:57.745
you'll take me to Kevdak
and you will see what

02:13:57.745 --> 02:14:00.345
I have for him.
And then maybe,

02:14:00.345 --> 02:14:04.428
just maybe, you can call
yourselves warriors again

02:14:05.589 --> 02:14:08.089
instead of piss pot squatters.

02:14:10.029 --> 02:14:12.167
There's a moment of
pause, as all the Goliaths

02:14:12.167 --> 02:14:14.791
who are approaching
have stopped in their tracks.

02:14:14.791 --> 02:14:16.875
You can see their neck muscles tensing

02:14:16.875 --> 02:14:18.458
as they're kind of ringing their fingers

02:14:18.458 --> 02:14:21.661
across the handles of
their various weapons.

02:14:22.381 --> 02:14:26.056
At this point, Greenbeard
takes a moment and

02:14:26.056 --> 02:14:28.723
(laughs evilly)

02:14:29.983 --> 02:14:33.441
"You sound like your cousin, Zanror."

02:14:33.441 --> 02:14:38.064
"The two of you enjoy a
night drinkin' in the hole.

02:14:38.064 --> 02:14:43.036
"But sure, you want to go
ahead and talk to the big man."

02:14:43.036 --> 02:14:47.203
"Let's see you say that to
his face before he crushes it."

02:14:51.286 --> 02:14:55.203
"Call him out. 
Thunder Lord, you've a visitor!"

02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:02.216
MARISHA: "Thunder Lord"?

02:15:02.216 --> 02:15:06.005
At which point all the Goliaths step back,

02:15:06.005 --> 02:15:10.172
and some of them turn their
blades or weapons around and -

02:15:14.164 --> 02:15:17.174
start slamming them on
the ground in a rhythmic tone.

02:15:17.174 --> 02:15:20.138
(group groans)

02:15:21.018 --> 02:15:22.424
Over and over again, and some of them

02:15:22.424 --> 02:15:26.635
start going into slow
chants (imitates chanting).

02:15:26.635 --> 02:15:28.130
And as this happens louder and louder,

02:15:28.130 --> 02:15:29.739
the clattering echos through

02:15:29.739 --> 02:15:33.383
the center of this market
place, this now desolate space.

02:15:33.383 --> 02:15:34.915
Some of them that were clutching people

02:15:34.915 --> 02:15:36.632
just kind of throw them to the side

02:15:36.632 --> 02:15:38.635
and some of the peasants
begin like scramble up

02:15:38.635 --> 02:15:40.381
against a wall, not knowing where to go.

02:15:40.381 --> 02:15:42.293
Or seemingly knowing that
if they were to try to flee,

02:15:42.293 --> 02:15:43.937
it would be the very
end of their existence

02:15:43.937 --> 02:15:45.355
and are just frozen in fear.

02:15:45.355 --> 02:15:48.360
As this is happening, you
see at the Margrave's home,

02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:51.634
the multi-tiered homestead,
this beautiful mansion,

02:15:51.634 --> 02:15:53.431
which is now smeared with gore,

02:15:53.431 --> 02:15:55.655
this dried dark brown and brittle,

02:15:55.655 --> 02:15:58.506
the flickering glow of interior

02:15:58.506 --> 02:16:00.440
candlelight catches your attention,

02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:04.741
until across the top
floor, you see a balcony

02:16:04.741 --> 02:16:08.527
that looks over the
entirety of this open area.

02:16:08.527 --> 02:16:12.194
And there the dark form
of Kevdak steps out,

02:16:13.531 --> 02:16:16.531
a towering Goliath in his own right.

02:16:18.660 --> 02:16:22.287
As he comes forward, puts
his hands on the railing,

02:16:22.287 --> 02:16:25.194
the rhythmic slamming of
the weapons growing loud,

02:16:25.194 --> 02:16:27.390
like this cacophonous rhythm.

02:16:27.390 --> 02:16:30.184
His fingers slowly tense, and the wood

02:16:30.184 --> 02:16:34.351
splinters in his grasp as
you can see before you,

02:16:34.351 --> 02:16:37.648
indeed the Titanstone
Gauntlets themselves

02:16:37.648 --> 02:16:41.816
almost cartoonish in size,
even against his large frame.

02:16:43.027 --> 02:16:46.148
He looks down with his gleaming red eyes,

02:16:46.148 --> 02:16:49.929
smooth bald head, no tattoo adorning it,

02:16:49.929 --> 02:16:52.933
but most of his
entire body nearly black

02:16:52.933 --> 02:16:56.829
with scrawlings of ink for
every single life he's taken

02:16:56.829 --> 02:16:58.662
as he's led this herd.

02:17:01.050 --> 02:17:02.218
He looks down.

02:17:03.226 --> 02:17:05.476
(laughter)

02:17:06.838 --> 02:17:10.338
Into the center of this area, down to you,

02:17:12.504 --> 02:17:15.587
with a joyous smile, almost and says,

02:17:19.439 --> 02:17:20.772
"Grog Strongjaw."

02:17:25.975 --> 02:17:28.808
"I would have never expected this,

02:17:30.494 --> 02:17:33.076
not in a very, very long time."

02:17:35.467 --> 02:17:37.278
"I've got to say, I've got
to give credit to my boy

02:17:37.278 --> 02:17:41.445
for not being quite the fable
maker that I thought he was,

02:17:43.702 --> 02:17:45.843
trying to appease me with the ideas of

02:17:45.843 --> 02:17:50.011
finishing a threat that
was apparently left hanging."

02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:56.128
"So, you come here, cast
away of the Herd of Storms."

02:17:58.318 --> 02:18:02.316
"You have my attention.
Now what words do you

02:18:02.316 --> 02:18:06.484
bring my ears, before I tear
them from your skull, boy?"

02:18:09.394 --> 02:18:10.644
Hello, uncle.

02:18:12.218 --> 02:18:16.386
The piece of shit you wiped
off your boot has come home.

02:18:17.787 --> 02:18:19.861
When last we saw each other,

02:18:19.861 --> 02:18:23.779
you saw it fitting to
beat down a mere child.

02:18:28.039 --> 02:18:31.639
I remember another child
that got a beating.

02:18:31.639 --> 02:18:34.195
Seems like he came from your nut sack.

02:18:34.195 --> 02:18:35.259
(laughter)

02:18:35.259 --> 02:18:38.175
And my, what an easy task that was.

02:18:42.121 --> 02:18:45.889
"Sometimes the easiest
are the most enjoyable."

02:18:45.889 --> 02:18:50.057
"If you let them string
out for a long, long time."

02:18:51.808 --> 02:18:55.519
Well, a regular chip off the old block.

02:18:55.519 --> 02:18:59.634
If he's anything like his father, that is.

02:18:59.634 --> 02:19:01.900
So I'll tell you why I've come back.

02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:03.331
"Please, do."

02:19:03.331 --> 02:19:05.998
See, I've grown, I've learned,

02:19:07.823 --> 02:19:11.990
I've also watched as dragons
took the mighty Kevdak,

02:19:14.282 --> 02:19:18.028
wielder of the Titanstone Knuckles,

02:19:18.028 --> 02:19:20.278
and made him bend the knee.

02:19:21.913 --> 02:19:26.191
I was wondering, do you also
squat when you piss now?

02:19:26.191 --> 02:19:28.439
(laughter)

02:19:28.439 --> 02:19:31.894
There are a few chuckles,
they're immediately

02:19:31.894 --> 02:19:34.227
silenced at the realization.

02:19:37.362 --> 02:19:41.232
Kevdak, seemingly un-flinched by this,

02:19:41.232 --> 02:19:44.639
he puts one hand on the
railing and leaps over it,

02:19:44.639 --> 02:19:46.002
(imitates booming)

02:19:46.002 --> 02:19:48.601
landing on the stone
platform that makes the roof

02:19:48.601 --> 02:19:53.461
of the initial walkway
and foyer of this mansion.

02:19:53.461 --> 02:19:55.761
He steps out to the edge
of it and crosses his arms,

02:19:55.761 --> 02:19:59.094
and goes, "See, that's your folly Grog,

02:20:01.014 --> 02:20:04.847
as it was your father's.
You're shortsighted."

02:20:07.464 --> 02:20:11.021
"Survival isn't just
chewing meat you find

02:20:11.021 --> 02:20:13.885
and killing what gets in your way."

02:20:13.885 --> 02:20:16.382
"If you pick a fight that you can't win,

02:20:16.382 --> 02:20:20.549
history won't remember a
blood smear on anyone's boot."

02:20:22.649 --> 02:20:24.649
"The dragon was a stage."

02:20:28.158 --> 02:20:30.739
"I've not bent the knee
like you think I have,

02:20:30.739 --> 02:20:34.739
I've merely let it
co-exist for the time being."

02:20:37.244 --> 02:20:41.636
"But let's just say that
dragon's days are numbered."

02:20:41.636 --> 02:20:45.803
"But it's a shame that you
won't be around to see."

02:20:47.197 --> 02:20:51.114
Oh, fancy words for what
I hear as surrender.

02:20:52.828 --> 02:20:54.807
But that's all right, I've always believed

02:20:54.807 --> 02:20:57.313
the world is what we make of it,

02:20:57.313 --> 02:21:00.769
and you've shown me exactly who you are.

02:21:00.769 --> 02:21:04.654
You've shown this herd exactly who you are

02:21:04.654 --> 02:21:09.049
and what they can expect:
to live a nice domesticated life,

02:21:09.049 --> 02:21:13.216
where the booty runs dry,
where the women are scarce,

02:21:15.252 --> 02:21:17.916
where I'm sure there are
plans this very minute

02:21:17.916 --> 02:21:20.833
to unseat you from your high horse.

02:21:22.365 --> 02:21:24.694
But I've come to do them a favor,

02:21:24.694 --> 02:21:27.502
they're not going to get that chance.

02:21:27.502 --> 02:21:29.502
You and me.

02:21:29.502 --> 02:21:36.572
I challenge you to single combat
for the pride of this herd.

02:21:38.246 --> 02:21:40.496
(applause)

02:21:42.349 --> 02:21:45.289
At this moment, there is a long silence,

02:21:45.289 --> 02:21:48.963
as just a breeze kind of (imitates wind)

02:21:48.963 --> 02:21:52.880
finds it's way through
the center of this town.

02:21:54.783 --> 02:21:56.965
Kevdak waits, motionless,

02:21:56.965 --> 02:22:00.351
at the top of the mansion precipice.

02:22:00.351 --> 02:22:02.388
Everyone else looks up to him, from you,

02:22:02.388 --> 02:22:05.684
their faces aghast at what just transpired

02:22:05.684 --> 02:22:08.934
and staring up to him atop the mansion.

02:22:09.900 --> 02:22:12.906
He looks down, one side of his mouth

02:22:12.906 --> 02:22:17.008
curls into a wicked smirk.

02:22:17.008 --> 02:22:20.008
He puts his hand up like this,

02:22:20.008 --> 02:22:22.235
and you see as the rows of archers

02:22:22.235 --> 02:22:24.459
that were along the roof
tops of nearby buildings,

02:22:24.459 --> 02:22:28.626
lessen their grip on the
bow and put the arrows away.

02:22:33.276 --> 02:22:35.443
He crosses his arms again.

02:22:38.942 --> 02:22:42.939
"We reserve the right of single combat

02:22:42.939 --> 02:22:45.772
to members of the Herd of Storms."

02:22:47.415 --> 02:22:53.479
"You haven't been a number
within our midst for years,

02:22:53.479 --> 02:22:58.255
since you decided to lie
there and bleed like a goat."

02:23:01.235 --> 02:23:06.488
"But, I can't say I'm
not amused by your gall."

02:23:07.579 --> 02:23:12.356
"So, for the purposes of this bout,

02:23:14.552 --> 02:23:18.258
let it be known that Grog Strongjaw

02:23:18.258 --> 02:23:21.175
is a temporary member of the herd."

02:23:23.009 --> 02:23:27.176
"But the moment his lifeless
corpse hits the stone,

02:23:28.201 --> 02:23:33.518
"he will be stripped of any
honor and fed to the wolves."

02:23:35.846 --> 02:23:36.898
(growls)

02:23:36.898 --> 02:23:40.443
And he leaps off and lands cracking

02:23:40.443 --> 02:23:43.288
the stone beneath his feet.

02:23:43.288 --> 02:23:46.621
As he stands again, "Assemble the ring!"

02:23:47.845 --> 02:23:49.403
And you watch as all of the goliaths

02:23:49.403 --> 02:23:51.195
start grabbing and moving the barricades,

02:23:51.195 --> 02:23:54.278
scooting them into a circular pattern

02:23:55.439 --> 02:23:57.874
around the center of this area.

02:23:57.874 --> 02:24:00.338
Go ahead and fetch the
town square if you could.

02:24:00.338 --> 02:24:01.458
LAURA: Oh jeez.

02:24:01.458 --> 02:24:05.365
GROUP: Fetch the town
square, if you please.

02:24:05.365 --> 02:24:07.583
(laughter)

02:24:07.583 --> 02:24:08.583
Oh my God.

02:24:10.794 --> 02:24:12.222
Oh, look.

02:24:12.222 --> 02:24:14.644
TALIESIN: You really did it, you son of a bitch.

02:24:14.644 --> 02:24:16.534
You weren't kidding.

02:24:16.534 --> 02:24:19.292
(laughter)

02:24:19.292 --> 02:24:20.864
TALIESIN: Three days ago,

02:24:20.864 --> 02:24:22.902
we had dinner and he left the sushi bar

02:24:22.902 --> 02:24:24.816
with a big handful of toothpicks going,

02:24:24.816 --> 02:24:26.372
"I have plans for these."

02:24:26.372 --> 02:24:27.769
(laughter)

02:24:27.769 --> 02:24:28.644
LAURA: That's hilarious.

02:24:28.644 --> 02:24:30.957
MARISHA: That's true. I was like,
did you steal toothpicks?

02:24:30.957 --> 02:24:31.895
He did.

02:24:31.895 --> 02:24:32.956
MATT: All righty, so...

02:24:32.956 --> 02:24:34.449
LAURA and SAM: Oh my God.

02:24:34.449 --> 02:24:37.422
It's beautiful and it's
all made out of cake.

02:24:37.422 --> 02:24:40.412
(laughter)

02:24:40.412 --> 02:24:42.554
LIAM: I can't believe
I ate the whole thing.

02:24:42.554 --> 02:24:46.094
Fuck that house, look at that house.

02:24:46.094 --> 02:24:48.033
LAURA: The spikes are facing inward?

02:24:48.033 --> 02:24:49.950
MATT: Yes, they are.

02:24:52.627 --> 02:24:54.354
LIAM: Oh, it's so tight.

02:24:54.354 --> 02:24:58.525
LIAM and LAURA: Tight, tight, tight, tight, tight, tight.

02:24:58.525 --> 02:25:00.830
Are we around, can we see any of this?

02:25:00.830 --> 02:25:03.249
MATT: You guys are watching this happen.

02:25:03.249 --> 02:25:04.433
MARISHA: Yeah, where are we?

02:25:04.433 --> 02:25:06.674
We're flanking, slowly but surely.

02:25:06.674 --> 02:25:07.582
LAURA: Stealthily.

02:25:07.582 --> 02:25:10.119
TALIESIN: I'm finding perch on a rooftop,

02:25:10.119 --> 02:25:12.286
so that I can deal with this shit.

02:25:12.286 --> 02:25:14.026
MARISHA: I'm a puff of clouds.

02:25:14.026 --> 02:25:16.017
SAM: I'm holding Pike's hand.

02:25:16.017 --> 02:25:18.092
(laughter)

02:25:18.092 --> 02:25:19.499
SAM: For comfort, my comfort.

02:25:19.499 --> 02:25:21.238
LAURA: I'm feel guilty for
getting in a fight with my

02:25:21.238 --> 02:25:25.071
brother, right before I
got up on the rooftop.

02:25:30.071 --> 02:25:32.904
TALIESIN: This is a great idea.

02:25:34.608 --> 02:25:37.132
SAM: This is the part
where Matt plays dolls.

02:25:37.132 --> 02:25:38.517
MATT: Yep, pretty much.

02:25:38.517 --> 02:25:40.630
(laughter)

02:25:40.630 --> 02:25:43.600
All right, so where are you guys right now?

02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:44.853
You're watching this happen from a

02:25:44.853 --> 02:25:47.261
distant rooftop, right at the edge.

02:25:47.261 --> 02:25:49.791
TALIESIN: Is it possible to move the
camera to get the house?

02:25:49.791 --> 02:25:51.135
I was flanking.

02:25:51.135 --> 02:25:54.382
MATT: Right, so you are
currently in elemental form.

02:25:54.382 --> 02:25:58.549
Kind I kind of attempt to
actually get on the roof?

02:26:00.778 --> 02:26:02.528
MATT: On the roof...

02:26:03.077 --> 02:26:06.296
MARISHA: Can I get on this balcony area?

02:26:06.296 --> 02:26:07.295
MATT: Over there?

02:26:07.295 --> 02:26:10.158
If you want to, it's going to be...

02:26:10.158 --> 02:26:12.241
MARISHA: In mist form?

02:26:14.451 --> 02:26:15.521
MATT: This isn't a mist form,

02:26:15.521 --> 02:26:17.129
this is your air elemental form.

02:26:17.129 --> 02:26:19.155
Or yeah, air elemental form.

02:26:19.155 --> 02:26:21.675
But I can move through things.

02:26:21.675 --> 02:26:23.565
MATT: You can, so you can...

02:26:23.565 --> 02:26:25.815
Super, super, super thin.

02:26:26.823 --> 02:26:28.344
MATT: Right, so you want
to just glide into like,

02:26:28.344 --> 02:26:30.244
part of the stonework over here, or...

02:26:30.244 --> 02:26:31.351
MARISHA: Right, yeah.

02:26:31.351 --> 02:26:32.440
All righty.

02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:35.123
So at this time, as everyone assembles

02:26:35.123 --> 02:26:37.115
all the spikes inward
in a circle position,

02:26:37.115 --> 02:26:39.678
and you stand in place, Kevdak walks into

02:26:39.678 --> 02:26:43.103
the center of the ring,
he takes the gauntlets,

02:26:43.103 --> 02:26:47.399
puts a hand out, and one
of the Goliaths comes up

02:26:47.399 --> 02:26:50.396
and takes a weapon that you
haven't seen in a while,

02:26:50.396 --> 02:26:56.753
this dark red rust-colored ax
is placed into his one hand,

02:26:56.762 --> 02:27:00.012
as the gauntlet grips around it,

02:27:00.012 --> 02:27:02.461
taking the Blood Ax in his hand,

02:27:02.461 --> 02:27:06.461
he closes his other fist
and slams them together

02:27:07.347 --> 02:27:10.235
and as he slams them together
with a sound of metal,

02:27:10.235 --> 02:27:13.038
his form warps and grows.

02:27:15.043 --> 02:27:16.889
And what was once already Kevdak,

02:27:16.889 --> 02:27:21.570
who held a good four to
five inches on your height,

02:27:21.570 --> 02:27:23.987
swells to about 12 feet tall.

02:27:25.139 --> 02:27:27.106
MARISHA: Excuse me?

02:27:27.106 --> 02:27:27.939
Oh shit.

02:27:30.233 --> 02:27:31.704
SAM: Wait, Kevdak just grew?

02:27:31.704 --> 02:27:32.576
Yes.

02:27:32.576 --> 02:27:33.450
LAURA: Kevdak just grew.

02:27:33.450 --> 02:27:34.950
SAM: Oh my God.

02:27:36.425 --> 02:27:37.576
MARISHA: Holy shit.

02:27:37.576 --> 02:27:38.677
TALIESIN: Ashley or Pike?

02:27:38.677 --> 02:27:43.313
MATT: So, whereabouts are
you guys at this moment?

02:27:43.313 --> 02:27:44.583
Just give me some inclination.

02:27:44.583 --> 02:27:48.365
Keyleth is over there,
keeping relatively hidden,

02:27:48.365 --> 02:27:51.014
as an air elemental, I need
you to make a stealth check

02:27:51.014 --> 02:27:54.264
as part of that, see if you're noticed.

02:27:55.673 --> 02:27:56.829
Natural 20.

02:27:56.829 --> 02:27:57.703
GROUP: Yes!

02:27:57.703 --> 02:27:59.394
MATT: That I like.

02:27:59.394 --> 02:28:01.167
Figure out where you're hiding.

02:28:01.167 --> 02:28:03.401
Are we coming from behind
there or from this side?

02:28:03.401 --> 02:28:07.568
MATT: This, you guys would be coming
from this direction here.

02:28:10.085 --> 02:28:12.349
TALIESIN: I'll take the 3 o'clock,
if the house is 12,

02:28:12.349 --> 02:28:13.499
I'll take the 3 o'clock.

02:28:13.499 --> 02:28:14.782
MATT: So you'll be kind of up in this--

02:28:14.782 --> 02:28:15.726
Over there.

02:28:15.726 --> 02:28:16.797
MATT: Over here?

02:28:16.797 --> 02:28:21.193
Okay, so we'll say Percy
is up on the roof area.

02:28:21.193 --> 02:28:25.026
TALIESIN: 6 o'clock,
9 o'clock, 12 o'clock.

02:28:25.916 --> 02:28:27.841
Okay, I need you to go ahead and
roll stealth check as well,

02:28:27.841 --> 02:28:30.546
as you move up there,
make sure you're not seen.

02:28:30.546 --> 02:28:31.419
Where are the rest of you?

02:28:31.419 --> 02:28:32.295
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

02:28:32.295 --> 02:28:34.956
(cheering)

02:28:34.956 --> 02:28:38.206
LAURA: Is there a roof in this area?

02:28:40.455 --> 02:28:41.288
MATT: There is.

02:28:43.182 --> 02:28:44.854
I'm going to put this
off to the side there,

02:28:44.854 --> 02:28:48.771
if you'd like to maneuver
in this area as well.

02:28:52.289 --> 02:28:53.504
For those who want to be on this side.

02:28:53.504 --> 02:28:56.541
Who wants to be up there with Vex?

02:28:56.541 --> 02:28:57.905
ASHLEY: Should we dimension door up there?

02:28:57.905 --> 02:28:59.295
SAM: Well, we've been...

02:28:59.295 --> 02:29:01.287
You guys have been following
to get to this area.

02:29:01.287 --> 02:29:02.547
SAM: We've been following wherever.

02:29:02.547 --> 02:29:04.189
You guys want to be up there with Vex?

02:29:04.189 --> 02:29:06.798
SAM: We probably went up
with Vex, probably, yeah.

02:29:06.798 --> 02:29:08.402
We don't know what we're doing.

02:29:08.402 --> 02:29:09.428
Okay. Vax, where are you?

02:29:09.428 --> 02:29:11.308
LIAM: I guess I'm maybe off by that

02:29:11.308 --> 02:29:13.684
fountain in the corner of your map.

02:29:13.684 --> 02:29:14.557
Over there?

02:29:14.557 --> 02:29:16.986
This is an open area over here.

02:29:16.986 --> 02:29:17.860
LIAM: That's all open?

02:29:17.860 --> 02:29:19.400
This is all open, this is the
center of the town square.

02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:20.558
LIAM: Then I would be at the bottom

02:29:20.558 --> 02:29:22.133
of the building that Vex is in.

02:29:22.133 --> 02:29:23.635
Okay, so you're kind of close down,

02:29:23.635 --> 02:29:25.283
like kind of looking through the window

02:29:25.283 --> 02:29:26.211
out into the main thoroughfare.

02:29:26.211 --> 02:29:27.444
Okay, good to know.

02:29:27.444 --> 02:29:31.611
So, Grog. With this,

02:29:33.027 --> 02:29:36.027
I want you to roll initiative.

02:29:39.443 --> 02:29:41.110
MARISHA: Oh my God.

02:29:42.791 --> 02:29:46.120
LAURA: Can I take Trinket out of the -

02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:48.096
If you'd like to, yeah, do you want to?

02:29:48.096 --> 02:29:48.929
Your call.

02:29:50.283 --> 02:29:51.883
SAM: Trinket's going to make some noise.

02:29:51.883 --> 02:29:52.756
Initiative?

02:29:52.756 --> 02:29:53.630
TRAVIS: 17.

02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:54.831
17.

02:29:54.831 --> 02:29:57.581
(dramatic music)

02:30:03.856 --> 02:30:06.356
As you guys begin this fray...

02:30:07.946 --> 02:30:10.922
No Trinket, yes Trinket,
what are you doing?

02:30:10.922 --> 02:30:12.113
Trinket is staying in.

02:30:12.113 --> 02:30:13.435
MATT: All right.

02:30:13.435 --> 02:30:16.435
You, as Kevdak takes on a large form,

02:30:16.435 --> 02:30:19.810
the blood ax swelling with his size,

02:30:19.810 --> 02:30:23.384
gets into a combat position and he says,

02:30:23.384 --> 02:30:26.801
"Show me what you've learned, Strongjaw."

02:30:27.658 --> 02:30:30.446
You're going first, you
beat him on initiative.

02:30:30.446 --> 02:30:31.320
Go for it.

02:30:31.320 --> 02:30:33.570
LAURA: Jesus.

02:30:36.171 --> 02:30:40.338
I would like to rage the
rage of my rage-y life.

02:30:40.338 --> 02:30:42.683
(laughter)

02:30:44.159 --> 02:30:48.326
And I would like to use
intimidating presence on Kevdak.

02:30:49.292 --> 02:30:50.125
Okay.

02:30:51.324 --> 02:30:52.692
SAM: That's a risk.

02:30:52.692 --> 02:30:53.878
(laughter)

02:30:53.878 --> 02:30:57.295
MATT: All right, so that's your action on that.

02:31:01.008 --> 02:31:03.425
So what's the DC on that one?

02:31:03.757 --> 02:31:04.631
TRAVIS: 18.

02:31:04.631 --> 02:31:06.385
MATT: And what's the save?

02:31:06.385 --> 02:31:10.468
TRAVIS: Oh,
17 is the wisdom saving throw.

02:31:13.599 --> 02:31:17.766
For that one, do you
remember if that one is a--

02:31:22.426 --> 02:31:25.415
TRAVIS: It says within 30 feet frighten
until end of next turn,

02:31:25.415 --> 02:31:28.332
wisdom saving throw.

02:31:30.046 --> 02:31:32.926
MATT: Yeah, okay. So as you glare, how
do you go about this glare,

02:31:32.926 --> 02:31:35.922
what do you do to intimidate him?

02:31:35.922 --> 02:31:38.339
I go into a rage.

02:31:38.339 --> 02:31:41.355
And with my flaming war
hammer, I grab the end of the

02:31:41.355 --> 02:31:45.226
hammer and let it cook
my flesh for a minute

02:31:45.226 --> 02:31:47.303
and then I smack myself on the chest

02:31:47.303 --> 02:31:50.062
and rip out the biggest bellow I have.

02:31:50.062 --> 02:31:54.265
As you do, Kevdak goes
to take a step forward,

02:31:54.265 --> 02:31:57.417
takes the single step, hesitates,

02:31:57.417 --> 02:31:59.326
seems to just hold his ground.

02:31:59.326 --> 02:32:03.493
Eyeing you down and seemingly
not expecting this ferocity.

02:32:09.866 --> 02:32:12.210
All righty, that's your
action and your bonus.

02:32:12.210 --> 02:32:13.653
Are you going to move,

02:32:13.653 --> 02:32:16.696
or are you going to stay where you are?

02:32:16.696 --> 02:32:18.516
There are no openings in the ring, right?

02:32:18.516 --> 02:32:19.389
MATT: Nope.

02:32:19.389 --> 02:32:21.027
SAM: You had inspiration, by the way,

02:32:21.027 --> 02:32:22.536
would that have helped at all?

02:32:22.536 --> 02:32:24.930
There are side openings, like areas here,

02:32:24.930 --> 02:32:27.541
where you could step out,
but you get the sense that,

02:32:27.541 --> 02:32:29.356
as people are gathering around,

02:32:29.356 --> 02:32:33.814
they would be plugging
elements of this exit,

02:32:33.814 --> 02:32:35.647
to prevent you from...

02:32:37.769 --> 02:32:39.825
closing the gap.

02:32:39.825 --> 02:32:42.908
With my bonus action I yell "Coward!"

02:32:43.785 --> 02:32:45.770
And that's it.

02:32:45.770 --> 02:32:47.950
MATT: Okay. Technically the
rage is the bonus action,

02:32:47.950 --> 02:32:49.633
but you can shout that for free.

02:32:49.633 --> 02:32:51.477
Yeah, that's fine.

02:32:51.477 --> 02:32:52.739
All right, so for Kevdak's turn,

02:32:52.739 --> 02:32:55.989
Kevdak kind of realizing that he can't,

02:32:58.029 --> 02:33:01.707
he's not able to really
move closer at this moment,

02:33:01.707 --> 02:33:06.402
kind of steps to the side here,
guarding, kind of waiting...

02:33:06.402 --> 02:33:10.569
LIAM: His version of
fear was not digging in.

02:33:17.194 --> 02:33:20.134
MATT: Yeah, he's going to go ahead
and take a bonus action

02:33:20.134 --> 02:33:22.644
to go into his own rage.

02:33:28.278 --> 02:33:30.307
I just had to try and make
it work at least once.

02:33:30.307 --> 02:33:31.642
SAM: It worked.

02:33:31.642 --> 02:33:32.655
TRAVIS: And it did.

02:33:33.626 --> 02:33:35.252
Hey man, at least I can say

02:33:35.252 --> 02:33:37.006
I didn't die without it working once.

02:33:37.006 --> 02:33:38.268
LAURA: Don't say that!

02:33:38.268 --> 02:33:39.380
ASHLEY: You're not going to die, Grog.

02:33:40.254 --> 02:33:42.288
So Kevdak goes into his own rage,

02:33:42.288 --> 02:33:45.507
as Kevdak goes into a rage, screaming out.

02:33:45.507 --> 02:33:48.015
(growls)

02:33:48.015 --> 02:33:50.538
The ground shakes and little stones and rocks

02:33:50.538 --> 02:33:53.408
scatter across the stonework
from the vibration of it.

02:33:53.408 --> 02:33:55.185
And you see some of those tattoos,

02:33:55.185 --> 02:33:57.479
the black ink that goes across his chest,

02:33:57.479 --> 02:33:59.680
you see what looks like a bear

02:33:59.680 --> 02:34:01.637
that is hidden within the tattoo,

02:34:01.637 --> 02:34:06.261
that flares up with a flash of
dark, deep red crimson energy

02:34:06.261 --> 02:34:08.393
and then fades back into the chest.

02:34:08.393 --> 02:34:09.382
LAURA: What?

02:34:09.382 --> 02:34:11.058
TALIESIN: 1984 with it.

02:34:11.058 --> 02:34:13.202
MATT: You're up Grog.

02:34:13.202 --> 02:34:14.035
Raging.

02:34:18.688 --> 02:34:22.688
I'll go into a frenzied rage
and I charge headlong

02:34:24.837 --> 02:34:28.381
into Kevdak with my firebrand war hammer.

02:34:28.381 --> 02:34:29.926
MATT: All right.

02:34:29.926 --> 02:34:34.009
Actually, he backed up
against the ring, right?

02:34:34.968 --> 02:34:36.788
(group excitedly exclaims)

02:34:36.788 --> 02:34:37.725
MATT: He's backed up against the edge

02:34:37.725 --> 02:34:39.539
of one of the openings, but
if you want to go from here...

02:34:39.539 --> 02:34:42.008
But there's large
point-ies behind him right?

02:34:42.008 --> 02:34:43.140
MATT: At one angle, yeah.

02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:46.061
I'd like to drive my head
right into his chest.

02:34:46.061 --> 02:34:48.462
Can I move into him hard,

02:34:48.462 --> 02:34:51.272
see if I can push him back
against one of the spikes?

02:34:51.272 --> 02:34:53.297
I'll say sure.

02:34:53.297 --> 02:34:55.383
I still have, if I'm frenzy-ing,

02:34:55.383 --> 02:34:57.569
would I still have two attacks after that?

02:34:57.569 --> 02:34:59.506
That would be your action, to do that,

02:34:59.506 --> 02:35:02.828
so you would have your bonus
action of you wanted to.

02:35:02.828 --> 02:35:04.886
I'll just run up to him
and hit him three times.

02:35:04.886 --> 02:35:06.219
Okay, go for it.

02:35:10.895 --> 02:35:13.327
Yeah, the first two are just normal.

02:35:13.327 --> 02:35:15.577
I'll just roll these first.

02:35:17.073 --> 02:35:18.360
27.

02:35:18.360 --> 02:35:19.360
That hits.

02:35:22.755 --> 02:35:23.913
24.

02:35:23.913 --> 02:35:24.746
Hits.

02:35:28.692 --> 02:35:29.704
16.

02:35:29.704 --> 02:35:30.734
Misses.

02:35:30.734 --> 02:35:31.948
ASHLEY: War God's blessing?

02:35:31.948 --> 02:35:33.023
MATT: What's the range on that?

02:35:33.023 --> 02:35:35.456
LAURA: Oh and you have inspiration, that's right.

02:35:35.456 --> 02:35:38.648
TALIESIN: Yeah, but this may not
be the moment though.

02:35:39.278 --> 02:35:40.881
SAM: I've got more.

02:35:40.889 --> 02:35:41.952
TALIESIN: It's early.

02:35:41.952 --> 02:35:44.609
ASHLEY: Where the fuck is my thing?

02:35:44.609 --> 02:35:47.887
Oh, it's right in front of me.

02:35:47.887 --> 02:35:49.517
Unfortunately inspiration
fades in ten minutes.

02:35:49.517 --> 02:35:50.769
ASHLEY: 30 feet, so...

02:35:50.769 --> 02:35:51.951
30 feet, yeah, that's too far away

02:35:51.951 --> 02:35:53.493
for War God's Blessing.

02:35:53.493 --> 02:35:56.092
So the first two strikes, go
ahead and roll for damage.

02:35:56.092 --> 02:35:57.034
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:35:57.034 --> 02:35:58.201
They do hit.

02:35:59.519 --> 02:36:00.642
Where the fuck is it?

02:36:00.642 --> 02:36:01.975
Oh, there it is.

02:36:03.612 --> 02:36:06.029
10, 15, 23, 23, oh 23 plus...

02:36:09.907 --> 02:36:13.592
Five, so 28 with the fire
damage on the first one.

02:36:13.592 --> 02:36:15.342
And the second one...

02:36:20.103 --> 02:36:20.936
17.

02:36:22.067 --> 02:36:22.900
17, okay.

02:36:25.947 --> 02:36:29.363
As you slam, whack, whack,
with the flaming war hammer,

02:36:29.363 --> 02:36:33.100
twice into the oversize Kevdak's chest,

02:36:33.100 --> 02:36:36.251
each hit hits, but Kevdak is
just barely pushed back by each

02:36:36.251 --> 02:36:40.418
and the damage, even the fire
damage, seems to be taken

02:36:41.821 --> 02:36:45.568
down by his raging capabilities.

02:36:49.377 --> 02:36:51.231
The impacts aren't doing as much damage

02:36:51.231 --> 02:36:53.132
as you hoped they would.

02:36:53.132 --> 02:36:54.505
SAM: Dammit.

02:36:54.505 --> 02:36:56.062
MATT: But I believe that ends

02:36:56.062 --> 02:36:57.714
your turn, unless you want to move?

02:36:57.714 --> 02:36:59.180
Nope, no moving.

02:36:59.180 --> 02:37:02.077
MATT: All right. Kevdak's turn.
Kevdak's going to go ahead

02:37:02.077 --> 02:37:04.327
and strafe around this way.

02:37:06.183 --> 02:37:11.023
And his going to go ahead
and reckless attack on you,

02:37:11.023 --> 02:37:14.652
so that's an advantage on each strike.

02:37:14.652 --> 02:37:18.652
Is going to take both of
these as weapon master.

02:37:24.713 --> 02:37:28.431
That is a 28 to hit, sorry minus five, 23.

02:37:28.431 --> 02:37:29.394
TRAVIS: Hits.

02:37:29.394 --> 02:37:30.477
Second one.

02:37:37.371 --> 02:37:40.874
28 to hit again, with the minus five.

02:37:40.874 --> 02:37:42.784
TRAVIS: Misses, I mean hits, sorry.

02:37:42.784 --> 02:37:45.117
All right, let's see...

02:37:57.628 --> 02:37:59.045
Less than that...

02:38:00.358 --> 02:38:03.004
As both of the ax swings come through you,

02:38:03.004 --> 02:38:07.171
you suffer a total of 54
points of slashing damage.

02:38:09.311 --> 02:38:10.186
TRAVIS: Reduced?

02:38:10.186 --> 02:38:13.769
Reduced by half, so that brings it to 27.

02:38:16.213 --> 02:38:20.213
Plus an additional ten
points of necrotic damage

02:38:22.290 --> 02:38:24.268
that you do not reduce.

02:38:24.268 --> 02:38:27.462
LAURA: While all the attention
is focused on them,

02:38:27.462 --> 02:38:29.464
can I stealth down to
the ground for a second?

02:38:29.464 --> 02:38:30.805
MATT: Make a stealth check.

02:38:30.805 --> 02:38:32.885
How are you getting down?

02:38:32.885 --> 02:38:34.410
Are you climbing down via acrobatics?

02:38:34.410 --> 02:38:37.660
So make a stealth and acrobatics check.

02:38:39.345 --> 02:38:40.762
29 for stealth.

02:38:43.057 --> 02:38:44.900
And 25 for acrobatics.

02:38:44.900 --> 02:38:47.528
Okay. You manage to make it to the ground.

02:38:47.528 --> 02:38:49.711
Kind of jumping off the
side, parkouring down,

02:38:49.711 --> 02:38:51.206
grabbing the next ledge, leaping down.

02:38:51.206 --> 02:38:52.782
That's your turn.

02:38:52.782 --> 02:38:55.839
Okay, anybody else doing anything?

02:38:55.839 --> 02:38:57.498
Until we come back in the next round?

02:38:57.498 --> 02:38:59.008
SAM: I mean...

02:38:59.008 --> 02:39:02.100
MARISHA: Do we do anything right now?

02:39:02.100 --> 02:39:04.791
Not until he says so.

02:39:05.679 --> 02:39:06.960
LAURA: I just want to duck, can I just

02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:08.890
duck in the building at least?

02:39:08.890 --> 02:39:10.519
Is that part of the stealth?

02:39:10.519 --> 02:39:12.130
MATT: Sure, you come to the door

02:39:12.130 --> 02:39:14.024
and the door itself is not locked,

02:39:14.024 --> 02:39:15.513
you kind of just push
on the side of the door.

02:39:15.513 --> 02:39:19.169
Everyone's attention is
so focused on the center.

02:39:19.169 --> 02:39:21.782
All right. So that brings it
to the top of the round,

02:39:21.782 --> 02:39:23.539
Grog, you're up.

02:39:23.539 --> 02:39:25.159
Feeling the impact of those hits,

02:39:25.159 --> 02:39:28.468
and remembering our first encounter,

02:39:28.468 --> 02:39:31.135
I drop the firebrand war hammer,

02:39:32.783 --> 02:39:36.950
I rush Kevdak, and I want to
try and rip away the blood ax.

02:39:39.125 --> 02:39:40.375
MARISHA: Oh.

02:39:42.228 --> 02:39:43.061
MATT: Okay.

02:39:44.988 --> 02:39:47.804
You rush up and drop the hammer.

02:39:47.804 --> 02:39:50.320
Grab and you're face to face,

02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:52.527
it's right at your feet,
you reach up and grab,

02:39:52.527 --> 02:39:54.480
with your fingers just
barely wrapped around this

02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:58.403
ax's shaft right now, at
the size that it's swollen,

02:39:58.403 --> 02:40:00.645
and you pull against him,

02:40:00.645 --> 02:40:02.291
I want you to go ahead
and make a strength check.

02:40:02.291 --> 02:40:04.057
TRAVIS: Which I get advantage on.

02:40:04.057 --> 02:40:05.482
MATT: Yeah, versus his strength,

02:40:05.482 --> 02:40:07.732
which he gets advantage on.

02:40:11.825 --> 02:40:12.658
17.

02:40:13.743 --> 02:40:14.719
Natural 20.

02:40:14.719 --> 02:40:16.126
LAURA: Oh, come on!

02:40:16.126 --> 02:40:20.293
As you pull, Kevdak actually
lifts you up off the ground,

02:40:22.083 --> 02:40:26.400
holding the ax up to
his face and just goes,

02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:28.400
"Like father, like son."

02:40:29.779 --> 02:40:33.164
And shakes you off, well
doesn't even shake you off,

02:40:33.164 --> 02:40:37.331
just butts you off of the ax
and you skid to the ground.

02:40:40.137 --> 02:40:42.776
Take one point of bludgeoning
damage, no big deal.

02:40:42.776 --> 02:40:45.274
Land on the ground, you don't fall prone,

02:40:45.274 --> 02:40:46.925
but you're there and can probably grab

02:40:46.925 --> 02:40:49.381
your war hammer and pick
it back up if you want to.

02:40:49.381 --> 02:40:50.829
TRAVIS: Yep, I'll do that.

02:40:50.829 --> 02:40:53.362
TALIESIN: Oh my God, oh my God.

02:40:53.362 --> 02:40:54.814
That ends your turn.

02:40:54.814 --> 02:40:58.492
Now Kevdak, who's kind
of laughing to himself.

02:40:58.492 --> 02:41:01.743
(laughs evilly)

02:41:01.743 --> 02:41:03.678
MARISHA: Oh, he's consulting the book.

02:41:03.678 --> 02:41:05.556
TALIESIN: I hate when he does that.

02:41:05.556 --> 02:41:07.594
Why, what could that possibly mean?

02:41:07.594 --> 02:41:09.373
LIAM: He's probably looking
up the price of a mace.

02:41:09.373 --> 02:41:10.352
MARISHA: Totally.

02:41:10.352 --> 02:41:13.019
What's an adventurer's kit run for?

02:41:13.998 --> 02:41:15.695
SAM: Who did this illustration again?

02:41:15.695 --> 02:41:16.860
Oh yeah, I remember.

02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:20.113
MATT: Why don't you make an athletics check.

02:41:20.113 --> 02:41:21.883
TALIESIN: Does he get advantage on that?

02:41:21.883 --> 02:41:25.383
MATT: Yes, you do, because of the rage.

02:41:29.915 --> 02:41:31.173
19.

02:41:31.173 --> 02:41:32.423
19, well, 22.

02:41:33.705 --> 02:41:36.063
He puts the ax to one hand,

02:41:36.063 --> 02:41:38.103
reaches down with his large mitt,

02:41:38.103 --> 02:41:39.705
grabs you and lifts you up

02:41:39.705 --> 02:41:43.625
and pushes you onto one
of the spears behind you.

02:41:44.922 --> 02:41:48.568
You can feel it actually pierce
out the front of your chest.

02:41:48.568 --> 02:41:49.594
(group groans)

02:41:49.594 --> 02:41:51.649
About six inches.

02:41:51.649 --> 02:41:54.068
Your feet are still on the ground,

02:41:54.068 --> 02:41:55.402
and you can feel yourself there,

02:41:55.402 --> 02:41:59.235
but there is an element
of being pinned there.

02:42:00.347 --> 02:42:05.994
You take 12 points of piercing
damage, reduced to six.

02:42:10.010 --> 02:42:14.177
This is nothing to a barbarian,
simple piercing, whatever.

02:42:16.973 --> 02:42:20.223
However you are technically considered,

02:42:21.827 --> 02:42:24.147
this would be grappled,
you're unable to move

02:42:24.147 --> 02:42:26.490
until you manage to break this.

02:42:26.490 --> 02:42:28.341
You can still attack from this
position if you wanted to,

02:42:28.341 --> 02:42:29.702
but you have to be able to try

02:42:29.702 --> 02:42:32.854
and spend an action to get free.

02:42:32.854 --> 02:42:35.502
So that's going to be the one attack,

02:42:35.502 --> 02:42:36.953
and then as your pinned, he's going to

02:42:36.953 --> 02:42:40.370
come up with the blood ax and swing down.

02:42:43.898 --> 02:42:46.961
That's going to be a 23 against you.

02:42:48.362 --> 02:42:51.652
Blood ax comes down and slams right

02:42:51.652 --> 02:42:54.592
into the front of your
chest, the sternum area,

02:42:54.592 --> 02:42:57.402
even with the weight of it,

02:42:59.490 --> 02:43:03.393
you bring your hands up
and grab the edge of it

02:43:03.393 --> 02:43:04.994
and manage to stop some of the force,

02:43:04.994 --> 02:43:08.560
but it still digs into
the front of your chest.

02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:17.327
You take 19 points of
slashing damage, reduced to 9.

02:43:18.572 --> 02:43:20.990
I release Trinket inside
the house that I'm in.

02:43:20.990 --> 02:43:22.770
MATT: Plus an additional six necrotic

02:43:22.770 --> 02:43:24.923
that does not get reduced.

02:43:24.923 --> 02:43:27.345
So 9 and then six, so 15.

02:43:27.345 --> 02:43:29.239
MATT: What are you doing?

02:43:29.239 --> 02:43:33.253
I release Trinket,
quietly, inside the house.

02:43:33.253 --> 02:43:34.923
And tell him to keep quiet.

02:43:35.783 --> 02:43:37.116
Don't follow me.

02:43:39.298 --> 02:43:40.962
Okay. Anyone else do anything else?

02:43:40.962 --> 02:43:43.012
TALIESIN: No, I'm just trying to--

02:43:43.012 --> 02:43:46.091
I'm trying to keep us aware
of everything as possible.

02:43:46.091 --> 02:43:48.369
Pike an I are going to just inch forward

02:43:48.369 --> 02:43:51.493
on the rooftop, to get
just a little closer.

02:43:51.493 --> 02:43:54.140
Yeah, can I do the same
in my elemental form?

02:43:54.140 --> 02:43:55.858
Like, can I just mist kind of down around

02:43:55.858 --> 02:43:58.460
kind of right behind this asshole?

02:43:58.460 --> 02:44:00.877
What's up, I'm a spooky mist.

02:44:02.066 --> 02:44:03.613
ASHLEY: Would it take some time

02:44:03.613 --> 02:44:05.608
to get like behind that fountain?

02:44:05.608 --> 02:44:08.626
LIAM: That's in the open,
I asked about that first.

02:44:08.626 --> 02:44:11.336
TALIESIN: This is one quarter of the square.

02:44:12.237 --> 02:44:14.904
All right. Grog, it's your turn.

02:44:16.518 --> 02:44:18.285
You said I can attack from having

02:44:18.285 --> 02:44:21.821
a pole shoved through my shoulder?

02:44:21.821 --> 02:44:23.476
MATT: Yeah.

02:44:23.476 --> 02:44:25.456
Would that be at disadvantage?

02:44:25.456 --> 02:44:26.962
MATT: No, not at this distance.

02:44:26.962 --> 02:44:29.570
You just, you're grappled,
so you can't move.

02:44:29.570 --> 02:44:31.950
You're essentially stuck
there until you use an action

02:44:31.950 --> 02:44:33.932
to get off of it, otherwise
you can't go anywhere.

02:44:33.932 --> 02:44:35.328
Yeah, I got to get off of it.

02:44:35.328 --> 02:44:36.719
I'm going to get off of it.

02:44:36.719 --> 02:44:38.441
MATT: Okay, so using an
action to break free.

02:44:38.441 --> 02:44:39.461
Yeah.

02:44:39.461 --> 02:44:42.074
MATT: Make an athletics check,

02:44:42.074 --> 02:44:45.157
with advantage because you're raging.

02:44:46.309 --> 02:44:47.306
23.

02:44:47.306 --> 02:44:48.306
MATT: 23?

02:44:49.931 --> 02:44:51.441
There's not a lot of
ground to pull yourself

02:44:51.441 --> 02:44:55.576
off of the weight, so instead,
with your feet on the ground,

02:44:55.576 --> 02:44:57.183
you reach forward and grab the front

02:44:57.183 --> 02:44:59.945
of his blood ax again and pull forward.

02:44:59.945 --> 02:45:03.257
And as you do, you feel the
back of this wooden spear,

02:45:03.257 --> 02:45:06.888
snap off and it's still
just embedded in your chest,

02:45:06.888 --> 02:45:09.811
poking out the front,
but you are now free,

02:45:09.811 --> 02:45:11.689
you still have your bonus action.

02:45:11.689 --> 02:45:15.106
I would like to use great weapon master

02:45:16.057 --> 02:45:19.545
and I have advantage on this
because he used reckless.

02:45:19.545 --> 02:45:20.689
MATT: Yep.

02:45:20.689 --> 02:45:22.871
And I'll use his inspiration.

02:45:22.871 --> 02:45:24.018
LAURA: If you need it.

02:45:24.018 --> 02:45:28.101
MATT: It faded, it only
lasts for ten minutes.

02:45:29.799 --> 02:45:30.798
23.

02:45:30.798 --> 02:45:34.548
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

02:45:39.670 --> 02:45:40.463
19.

02:45:42.300 --> 02:45:45.300
No, 29. Sorry.

02:45:45.594 --> 02:45:47.930
29 with the plus ten, right?

02:45:47.930 --> 02:45:50.303
Okay, that brings it to 14 damage,

02:45:50.303 --> 02:45:52.791
reduced by his rage effect as well.

02:45:52.791 --> 02:45:56.628
As the hammer slams once
again into his abdomen,

02:45:56.628 --> 02:45:58.495
you can see it leaving a char mark

02:45:58.495 --> 02:46:01.873
and actually kind of
obscuring one of the tattoos.

02:46:02.913 --> 02:46:03.996
"Stupid boy."

02:46:07.191 --> 02:46:09.300
You can move around him if you wanted to,

02:46:09.300 --> 02:46:10.627
you still have a movement.

02:46:10.627 --> 02:46:13.048
Yeah, I'll move, I would
like to move to his flank,

02:46:13.048 --> 02:46:15.591
away from the nearest pointy thing.

02:46:15.591 --> 02:46:17.535
MATT: Okay, so you shift around that way?

02:46:17.535 --> 02:46:20.803
Okay, with his turn now, he
spins around to face you.

02:46:20.803 --> 02:46:24.970
He's going to go ahead and
attempt his first attack on you,

02:46:27.313 --> 02:46:29.146
as a disarming attack.

02:46:31.107 --> 02:46:32.490
With advantage on that because,

02:46:32.490 --> 02:46:34.871
just going with this attack every round.

02:46:34.871 --> 02:46:36.871
That's going to be a 30.

02:46:38.289 --> 02:46:39.509
TRAVIS: Yeah, that'll hit.

02:46:39.509 --> 02:46:40.669
(laughter)

02:46:40.669 --> 02:46:42.717
Okay. Not Great Weapon Master.

02:46:42.717 --> 02:46:44.772
But it's 30, so it's
going to do an additional

02:46:44.772 --> 02:46:48.189
superiority die of damage on top of this.

02:46:49.231 --> 02:46:50.731
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

02:46:52.672 --> 02:46:56.839
So you take, all right.

02:46:57.293 --> 02:47:00.293
17 points of slashing damage.

02:47:02.819 --> 02:47:04.915
TRAVIS: Nine?

02:47:05.489 --> 02:47:08.208
Eight plus two necrotic, so 10 total.

02:47:08.958 --> 02:47:12.629
And I need you to go ahead and
make a strength saving throw.

02:47:12.629 --> 02:47:15.754
TALIESIN: Oh no, no advantage.

02:47:15.754 --> 02:47:17.222
MATT: With rage is it strength

02:47:17.222 --> 02:47:19.972
ability checks and saving throws?

02:47:20.905 --> 02:47:23.590
Advantage on strength check
and strength saving throws.

02:47:23.590 --> 02:47:26.840
MATT: So yeah, so advantage on this.

02:47:32.196 --> 02:47:33.334
13.

02:47:34.034 --> 02:47:35.033
MATT: 13.

02:47:35.033 --> 02:47:36.231
No, no, no 16.

02:47:36.231 --> 02:47:37.746
MATT: 16, okay.

02:47:37.746 --> 02:47:40.569
So as he slams into your side,

02:47:40.569 --> 02:47:43.757
you pull up your flaming war
hammer to guard the blow,

02:47:43.757 --> 02:47:47.094
it takes some of it, but then
he hooks the bottom of the ax

02:47:47.094 --> 02:47:51.066
underneath the head and actually
flings it out of your hand

02:47:51.066 --> 02:47:52.414
and you lose the grip on the war hammer,

02:47:52.414 --> 02:47:55.136
which then clatters to
the ground at your feet.

02:47:55.136 --> 02:47:57.740
He's then going to turn around.

02:47:57.740 --> 02:48:01.553
And going to go ahead
and do a pushing attack.

02:48:01.553 --> 02:48:03.636
With the superiority die.

02:48:05.107 --> 02:48:08.389
That is going to be, this is going to be,

02:48:08.389 --> 02:48:12.775
with Great Weapon Master,
that brings it to a 21.

02:48:12.775 --> 02:48:13.978
TRAVIS: That's my AC.

02:48:13.978 --> 02:48:17.728
MATT: All righty. So you take
from the actual blow,

02:48:19.469 --> 02:48:23.219
21 points of slashing
damage, reduced to ten.

02:48:24.667 --> 02:48:26.167
And five necrotic.

02:48:27.654 --> 02:48:30.429
I'm going to use my Stone's Endurance.

02:48:30.429 --> 02:48:32.012
MATT: Go for it.

02:48:33.407 --> 02:48:37.332
LAURA: What's Stone's Endurance?

02:48:37.332 --> 02:48:40.574
It's just a d12, which is a 12,

02:48:40.574 --> 02:48:43.491
plus my constitution, so that's 17.

02:48:44.648 --> 02:48:47.193
So as the blow comes, you just take it

02:48:47.193 --> 02:48:48.460
right to the center of the chest.

02:48:48.460 --> 02:48:50.808
As it hits, it barely cuts in before you

02:48:50.808 --> 02:48:54.397
go ahead and grab and
deflect it with your hand,

02:48:54.397 --> 02:48:56.155
doing no damage to you whatsoever.

02:48:56.155 --> 02:48:57.583
However the impact of it though--

02:48:57.583 --> 02:49:01.750
make a strength saving
throw with advantage again.

02:49:05.334 --> 02:49:06.158
18.

02:49:06.758 --> 02:49:09.288
18, however the sheer force
of trying to deflect it,

02:49:09.288 --> 02:49:13.455
does push you back 15 feet,
right on the edge there,

02:49:14.334 --> 02:49:16.772
we'll say you're right there, that's fine.

02:49:16.772 --> 02:49:20.244
And you stop right at the edge of another,

02:49:20.244 --> 02:49:22.486
edge of the spikes and
there are two goliaths

02:49:22.486 --> 02:49:24.245
that are there with their weapons out,

02:49:24.245 --> 02:49:26.144
just forcing you back into the ring,

02:49:26.144 --> 02:49:28.217
if you decide to back up any further.

02:49:29.973 --> 02:49:31.985
And with that, Kevdak's going
to go ahead and move forward

02:49:31.985 --> 02:49:34.903
and push you into that corner.

02:49:34.903 --> 02:49:37.320
That's going to end his turn.

02:49:39.927 --> 02:49:40.760
You're up.

02:49:44.956 --> 02:49:48.623
I'm going to look at Kevdak
and drop my arms to my side.

02:49:49.294 --> 02:49:51.674
MATT: It's already on your side actually.

02:49:51.674 --> 02:49:53.399
He disarmed you.

02:49:53.399 --> 02:49:55.152
No, not my arms.

02:49:55.152 --> 02:49:56.188
MATT: Oh, your arms, okay.

02:49:56.188 --> 02:49:57.521
Straight down.

02:49:59.297 --> 02:50:03.297
And I'm going to say,
"Clearly I've been a fool."

02:50:05.202 --> 02:50:08.702
"You are truly a foe to be reckoned with."

02:50:11.511 --> 02:50:14.428
And I will slowly drop to my knees.

02:50:15.396 --> 02:50:17.674
SAM: (gasps)

02:50:17.674 --> 02:50:18.841
(quietly) No, no Grog.

02:50:19.943 --> 02:50:22.432
And I will shout out:

02:50:22.432 --> 02:50:25.432
"Vox Machina!"

02:50:25.432 --> 02:50:28.535
"Fuck shit up!"

02:50:28.910 --> 02:50:31.160
(cheering)

02:50:31.386 --> 02:50:34.391
And we're going to go ahead
and end it there this week.

02:50:34.391 --> 02:50:36.058
(loud exclamations)

02:50:36.058 --> 02:50:37.917
It's 11 o'clock guys.

02:50:37.917 --> 02:50:39.435
Oh, all right.

02:50:39.435 --> 02:50:41.063
(groaning)

02:50:41.063 --> 02:50:42.062
It's 11 o'clock.

02:50:42.062 --> 02:50:43.660
MARISHA: And we started late.

02:50:43.660 --> 02:50:45.204
I know, I know.

02:50:45.204 --> 02:50:46.882
MARISHA: Curse you technical difficulties.

02:50:46.882 --> 02:50:48.916
(laughter)

02:50:48.916 --> 02:50:50.098
Wow.

02:50:50.098 --> 02:50:53.628
We need to remember
where we are, you guys.

02:50:53.628 --> 02:50:54.626
TALIESIN: We'll take a photograph,

02:50:54.626 --> 02:50:55.637
that's what iPhones are for.

02:50:55.637 --> 02:50:57.486
MATT: No, we're taking photos.

02:50:57.486 --> 02:50:58.596
MARISHA: I don't think I can forget.

02:50:58.596 --> 02:50:59.835
MATT: I'm leaving this here for next week.

02:50:59.835 --> 02:51:02.576
So we can have this up and
ready for us to jump back in.

02:51:02.576 --> 02:51:05.383
LAURA: Oh my God-duh!

02:51:05.383 --> 02:51:07.210
MARISHA: Fuck shit up!

02:51:07.210 --> 02:51:09.220
LIAM: That's so unsatisfying!

02:51:09.220 --> 02:51:10.484
(groaning)

02:51:10.484 --> 02:51:12.368
ASHLEY: I want to go right now.

02:51:12.368 --> 02:51:13.368
MATT: If you guys want to keep going,

02:51:13.368 --> 02:51:15.299
we can go to midnight on, it's up to you.

02:51:15.299 --> 02:51:16.969
But it's a Thursday night.

02:51:16.969 --> 02:51:18.133
ASHLEY: I know.

02:51:18.133 --> 02:51:19.666
LAURA: Let's wait, let's wait.

02:51:19.666 --> 02:51:22.999
What's the general consensus say?

02:51:22.999 --> 02:51:24.052
I have to shoot tomorrow.

02:51:24.052 --> 02:51:25.211
The general consensus is it's 11 PM

02:51:25.211 --> 02:51:28.308
and we're keeping the crew here as well.

02:51:28.308 --> 02:51:29.306
SAM: Let's call it.

02:51:29.306 --> 02:51:31.405
And we had a very long Critmas

02:51:31.405 --> 02:51:32.958
and everything the week before,

02:51:32.958 --> 02:51:35.005
so let's go ahead and
we'll call it tonight.

02:51:35.005 --> 02:51:39.121
We'll pick up right at this
ridiculous moment next week.

02:51:39.261 --> 02:51:41.312
TALIESIN: Tune in next week.

02:51:41.312 --> 02:51:44.626
MARISHA: It's like the battle of blue balls.

02:51:45.556 --> 02:51:47.097
TALIESIN: Goliath balls are blue.

02:51:47.097 --> 02:51:49.877
Goliath balls are so blue.

02:51:49.877 --> 02:51:51.654
LAURA: Dude.

02:51:51.654 --> 02:51:52.680
TRAVIS: I was not expecting that.

02:51:52.680 --> 02:51:53.773
He was so much more powerful than what...

02:51:53.773 --> 02:51:54.944
Yeah, I was not expecting that.

02:51:54.944 --> 02:51:56.004
MARISHA: He's so big.

02:51:56.004 --> 02:51:57.012
SAM: I think you can take him.

02:51:57.012 --> 02:51:58.219
We'll figure it out.

02:51:58.219 --> 02:52:00.599
TRAVIS: I think it's going well.

02:52:00.599 --> 02:52:02.419
I think we've got him
right where I want him.

02:52:02.419 --> 02:52:07.335
MARISHA: Just five more
minutes, five more minutes.

02:52:07.335 --> 02:52:09.085
MATT: Yeah, that's rough.

02:52:11.375 --> 02:52:13.697
Where are you at hit points wise?

02:52:13.697 --> 02:52:15.043
133.

02:52:15.043 --> 02:52:16.477
SAM: You're fine,

02:52:16.477 --> 02:52:18.692
you could go for another six rounds!

02:52:18.692 --> 02:52:22.069
MARISHA: You're at 133 out of your total?

02:52:22.069 --> 02:52:23.400
201.

02:52:23.400 --> 02:52:25.110
(groaning)

02:52:25.110 --> 02:52:26.652
He's fine, he's fine.

02:52:26.652 --> 02:52:29.312
I'm doing nothing to him.

02:52:29.965 --> 02:52:31.850
TALIESIN: That's true,
you haven't done a thing.

02:52:31.850 --> 02:52:34.118
Has he done any damage to him at all?

02:52:34.118 --> 02:52:35.457
SAM: Yeah, a little.

02:52:35.457 --> 02:52:39.532
Yeah, Grog's done 34 points of damage.

02:52:39.532 --> 02:52:42.929
Wow, out of like 500 hit points probably.

02:52:42.929 --> 02:52:45.242
There's different paths to a barbarian,

02:52:45.242 --> 02:52:47.320
there's the frenzy path,
which is all about damage,

02:52:47.320 --> 02:52:50.250
there's the totem path,
which totem of the bear means

02:52:50.250 --> 02:52:53.895
your half damage for everything
except psychic damage.

02:52:54.965 --> 02:52:57.040
Grog, quick, be psychic.

02:52:57.040 --> 02:52:58.372
(laughter)

02:52:58.372 --> 02:53:00.078
Good luck with that guys.

02:53:00.078 --> 02:53:04.161
But yeah, this is where
that totem really shines.

02:53:05.897 --> 02:53:08.330
LIAM: If I steal your Kevdak mini,

02:53:08.330 --> 02:53:09.996
he can't be killed.

02:53:09.996 --> 02:53:10.994
SAM: That's true.

02:53:10.994 --> 02:53:11.992
MATT: I've got four.

02:53:11.992 --> 02:53:12.998
(laughter)

02:53:12.998 --> 02:53:13.997
Not really.

02:53:13.997 --> 02:53:17.284
Where does the other totem shine?

02:53:17.284 --> 02:53:19.362
In damage dealing, probably?

02:53:19.362 --> 02:53:21.803
Frenzy's all about damage and
that's what Grog's playing.

02:53:21.803 --> 02:53:24.285
Anyway guys, we'll pick this up next week

02:53:24.285 --> 02:53:26.124
at whatever this is about to be,

02:53:26.124 --> 02:53:30.217
and I have no idea what
this is about to be.

02:53:30.217 --> 02:53:31.383
With cameras and stuff though,

02:53:31.383 --> 02:53:32.706
we'll have cameras and stuff here.

02:53:32.706 --> 02:53:34.197
Yeah, hopefully functional cameras.

02:53:34.197 --> 02:53:36.374
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll have a video card next week.

02:53:36.374 --> 02:53:41.113
We may already have one
thanks to Frye's Electronics.

02:53:41.113 --> 02:53:42.462
The fickleness of technology

02:53:42.462 --> 02:53:44.819
and the wondrous hard work of our crew.

02:53:44.819 --> 02:53:46.751
Make this still happen guys.

02:53:46.751 --> 02:53:48.493
Once again, as I don't know who it was

02:53:48.493 --> 02:53:51.106
that pointed it out,
but we went 50 episodes.

02:53:51.106 --> 02:53:52.103
That was me.

02:53:52.103 --> 02:53:54.518
50 episodes without any real huge..

02:53:54.518 --> 02:53:55.795
MATT: Hardware failures, yeah.

02:53:55.795 --> 02:53:57.060
Hardware failures.

02:53:57.060 --> 02:53:58.743
So that's funny.

02:53:58.743 --> 02:54:00.660
Episode 51 just ate it.

02:54:02.657 --> 02:54:07.265
Thank you guys for enduring
our spree of technical issues,

02:54:07.265 --> 02:54:09.749
and our evening of one cuts,

02:54:09.749 --> 02:54:11.058
I hope it wasn't too distracting.

02:54:11.058 --> 02:54:13.726
Please do come back next week,

02:54:13.726 --> 02:54:16.874
because this shit's going to be crazy.

02:54:16.874 --> 02:54:18.107
(laughter)

02:54:18.107 --> 02:54:20.083
You're not going to want to miss this.

02:54:20.083 --> 02:54:21.752
So yeah, we'll see you guys next week, and...

02:54:22.522 --> 02:54:23.969
Is it Thursday yet?

02:54:23.969 --> 02:54:25.346
Have a good night.
