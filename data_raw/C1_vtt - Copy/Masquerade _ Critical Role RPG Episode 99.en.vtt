00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.186
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.186 --> 00:00:11.802
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. For our
99th episode, which is crazy, that's absolute

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:17.617
batshit. Makes next week the 100th, which is
crazy, even more crazy, and we'll be more crazy.

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:21.155
TRAVIS: You did the math wrong there. Oh no,
that's right.

00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:27.262
MATT: Yeah, that's right. Yeah, intelligence six.
Anyway, guys, welcome! We have an awesome guest.

00:00:27.262 --> 00:00:28.903
Tonight Jon Heder will be joining us--

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:31.575
(cheering)

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:33.047
ASHLEY: Who is it? Who is it?

00:00:33.047 --> 00:00:37.274
MATT: -- at the point in the narrative in which
his character will arrive. But, before then, let's

00:00:37.274 --> 00:00:42.066
go ahead and get to our announcements for the
evening. First and foremost, we have a new merch

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.458
item, I believe.

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:44.578
LAURA: Yes, we do!

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:46.210
MATT: Laura, if you want to introduce it and
possibly--

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.443
LAURA: Oh, well I know some of you have been
wanting to hear more about Scanlan, and we thought

00:00:51.443 --> 00:00:56.135
it would be great to release a concert tee of his.
Wait, turn around,

00:00:56.135 --> 00:00:58.240
because it's even better on the back.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.259
(cheering)

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:06.208
LAURA: And if you notice, he's got a few canceled
appearances there at the end because--

00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:07.872
SAM: Because he died.

00:01:07.872 --> 00:01:09.569
TRAVIS: Because he's a traitorous bitch.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:15.002
LAURA: Yeah, and it's pretty cool, so there's
that. And that's in the store right now!

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:16.148
Go check it out.

00:01:16.148 --> 00:01:17.494
MARISHA: Oh my god, right now.

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:18.976
TRAVIS: Enter the Meat Man.

00:01:18.976 --> 00:01:21.505
SAM: If we can't have Scanlan, at least we've got
the shirt.

00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:23.330
LAURA: That's right. That's right.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.628
LIAM: And good memories.

00:01:24.628 --> 00:01:27.128
(laughter)

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:30.369
LAURA: Maybe, maybe we'll see Scanlan in concert
sometime.

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.383
MARISHA: And we'll be like, "We used to hang out
with him before he was famous."

00:01:34.383 --> 00:01:38.535
LAURA: Yeah, before he was famous. Marisha, you've
got a little food on your mouth.

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:43.661
Under your lip. You got it.

00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:46.613
SAM: Announcements continue!

00:01:46.613 --> 00:01:53.403
MATT: Yes, so anyway, other things. The campaign
guide, the Tal'Dorei campaign guide, info is up on

00:01:53.403 --> 00:01:57.403
the Green Ronin website. If you're looking for it,
they have dates of release, price points, and

00:01:57.403 --> 00:02:01.405
where you can find it and when. So if you go to
the Green Ronin website, Google search for Green

00:02:01.405 --> 00:02:05.708
Ronin, they have a section there for the front
page that has all the updates, or you can look at

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:10.613
@GreenRoninPub on twitter. They have the updates
there as well. I also retweeted it on my twitter

00:02:10.613 --> 00:02:17.072
so you can find it there. But that should answer
your questions. We've gotten a bunch today. Also,

00:02:17.072 --> 00:02:21.479
tomorrow and Saturday, up in Seattle, the actual
folks at Dungeons &amp; Dragons are doing the Stream

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:25.486
of Annihilation, in which they're having a bunch
of people from the community coming out there to

00:02:25.486 --> 00:02:31.036
play games together, mix it up, be crazy, and
unveil their new story setting which I'm really

00:02:31.036 --> 00:02:36.067
excited for you guys to find out about. But as
part of that, Marisha, Taliesin, Liam, and myself

00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:40.098
will be going up there and playing some games.
I'll be running a game on Saturday morning with

00:02:40.098 --> 00:02:47.066
the Guts, Girls, Glory group. And that is going to
be a lot of fun. So you should come watch. Find

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:51.205
the information at the official Dungeons and
Dragons twitter, and we'll look forward to seeing

00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:54.019
you guys over the next couple of days up there as
well.

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.270
LAURA: I'll be in Las Vegas this weekend for--

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.513
LIAM: Gambling?

00:02:57.513 --> 00:02:59.640
LAURA: No, for Gears of War event.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.097
ALL: Ooh!

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:06.417
LAURA: So if you guys play Gears of War
competitively, come out and fight and then see me

00:03:06.417 --> 00:03:07.876
while I'm there.

00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:10.106
TRAVIS: Are you going to play competitive Gears of
War?

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:12.123
LAURA: No, but I'm going to cheer people on,
though, real good.

00:03:12.123 --> 00:03:14.169
(laughter)

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:21.077
MATT: Well, cool, awesome! Also, next weekend, not
this, but the weekend after that, I'll be at A-Kon

00:03:21.077 --> 00:03:23.161
June 8-11 in Fort Worth, Texas.

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:25.087
TRAVIS: I went to college there.

00:03:25.087 --> 00:03:27.212
MATT: Yeah, Travis went to college there.

00:03:27.212 --> 00:03:30.911
MATT: Also, wanted to let you guys know that there is
a charity banquet event happening at the event,

00:03:30.967 --> 00:03:35.803
which is going to be a two- to three-hour dinner,
meal provided. Hang out. I'll be a part of that.

00:03:35.803 --> 00:03:39.084
You can come actually talk to me in person.
One of the few guaranteed ways I'll have an

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:43.746
opportunity to interface with people, so you don't
have to wait in line for it necessarily. It's an

00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:49.109
add-on to your con ticket, and if you're there,
the proceeds of that ticket all go to the Texas

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.541
Scottish Rite Hospital. So it's a cool event,
happy to support an awesome charity, and hopefully

00:03:53.541 --> 00:03:58.319
get to see some of you guys there. Wednesday Club,
Taliesin, what you got coming up?

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.967
TALIESIN: We're talking about the Young Avengers
this next week. We just finished Wonder Woman; it

00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:06.927
was a great time. We wore tiaras and capes and
talked.

00:04:06.927 --> 00:04:08.097
MARISHA: Did you really?

00:04:08.097 --> 00:04:10.545
TALIESIN: Matt wore the cape and I wore the tiara.
It was really good.

00:04:10.545 --> 00:04:12.089
SAM: The Young Avengers?

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:13.925
TALIESIN: We're going to be talking about the
Young Avengers which are--

00:04:13.925 --> 00:04:15.575
SAM: Kid Hulk, Kid Iron Man.

00:04:15.575 --> 00:04:25.165
TALIESIN: You are-- Hulkling. And Iron Lad. But
we're going to be talking about the teenage

00:04:25.165 --> 00:04:28.891
superheroes of the Marvel U, specifically the ones
who take the Avengers name, and they're really

00:04:28.891 --> 00:04:33.356
fun and the modern take on them is really going to
be influencing a lot of the stuff that ends up on

00:04:33.408 --> 00:04:36.165
TV and it's going to be a lot of fun. They're some
of my favorite books; they're badass.

00:04:36.222 --> 00:04:40.732
MATT: Awesome, thank you, Taliesin. Check out
Wednesday Club. And of course we have Talks

00:04:40.732 --> 00:04:45.983
Machina live on Tuesday next week, about this
episode you're gonna see tonight, at 7PM Pacific Time here

00:04:45.983 --> 00:04:48.916
on Twitch and Alpha, hosted by our fantastic Brian
Wayne Foster.

00:04:48.968 --> 00:04:51.341
ALL: Brian Wayne Foster!

00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:53.544
MATT: Yes, so check it out, then.

00:04:53.544 --> 00:04:55.209
LAURA: I've got one.

00:04:55.209 --> 00:04:56.362
MATT: What you got?

00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:57.564
LAURA: I didn't put it on the list.

00:04:57.564 --> 00:04:58.618
MATT: No, you didn't.

00:04:58.618 --> 00:05:00.325
LAURA: But it's a present for Liam O'Brien.

00:05:00.325 --> 00:05:01.661
(cheering)

00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:03.848
LAURA: I didn't get to give him his birthday
present last week, and now I do get to.

00:05:03.848 --> 00:05:05.682
LIAM: (shrieks)

00:05:05.682 --> 00:05:07.830
MARISHA: I just remembered it was your birthday.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.822
LIAM: Oh my goodness.

00:05:09.822 --> 00:05:11.874
LAURA: I wrapped it all pretty, open it up.

00:05:11.874 --> 00:05:14.702
LIAM: Okay, with a thank-you in advance and
afterwards as well.

00:05:14.702 --> 00:05:16.958
LAURA: Open it up!

00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:21.861
LIAM: We'll edit this part out, right? I just
meant the unwrapping.

00:05:21.861 --> 00:05:23.273
SAM: It's a ring box.

00:05:23.273 --> 00:05:24.697
TRAVIS: Please be a turd.

00:05:24.697 --> 00:05:27.665
LAURA: It's just a pile of blue poop.

00:05:27.665 --> 00:05:32.351
LIAM: Oh. Oh my god.

00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:33.916
LAURA: Did you see it?

00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:42.793
LIAM: Yes. Not big enough. It's a-- aw, man-- it's
beautiful.

00:05:42.793 --> 00:05:43.928
TRAVIS: What is it?

00:05:43.928 --> 00:05:48.773
LIAM: It's a ring and it's got raven feathers on
it and a little black gem. And on the inside it

00:05:48.773 --> 00:05:50.550
says, "Do not go far from me."

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.294
TRAVIS: Aw! Wow, twinsies.

00:05:53.294 --> 00:05:56.474
LIAM: Thank you.

00:05:56.474 --> 00:06:00.251
LAURA: You're welcome. I don't know if it will fit
you, but you know, happy birthday.

00:06:00.251 --> 00:06:03.805
SAM: Is it a genuine gold-style ring?

00:06:03.805 --> 00:06:05.054
LAURA: Did it fit?

00:06:05.054 --> 00:06:06.072
LIAM: It fit.

00:06:06.072 --> 00:06:08.348
LAURA: I guessed it! Yes!

00:06:08.348 --> 00:06:17.549
LIAM: It is beautiful. I love it so much. Perfect.
Love it. That's a great birthday present.

00:06:17.549 --> 00:06:18.824
LAURA: Well, all right.

00:06:18.824 --> 00:06:27.577
MATT: That's really awesome. Happy birthday. Both
of you guys after the fact. Yay. All right, then.

00:06:27.577 --> 00:06:33.775
Unless anyone has anything else? Let's go ahead
and dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:06:33.775 --> 00:08:04.378
[dramatic music]

00:08:04.378 --> 00:08:11.789
MATT: Hello, and welcome back. So, where we last
left off, Vox Machina had discovered that one of

00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:16.492
their companions, the most recent addition to their
team, Taryon Darrington, had gone missing,

00:08:16.492 --> 00:08:23.170
seemingly taken by a bounty hunter who had
masqueraded as a pastry chef and was retrieving

00:08:23.229 --> 00:08:30.327
him to be returned to Wildmount within the city of
Deastok to the rest of the Darrington family. Upon

00:08:30.327 --> 00:08:36.518
heading them off the pass and retrieving Taryon,
you all made your way to Deastok and spoke with

00:08:36.518 --> 00:08:41.813
the rest of the Taryon Darrington family and
discovered, it seems, that they have gone into

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:49.500
serious debt. There's been a long-running
agreement between the Darringtons and a criminal

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.814
syndicate known as the Myriad that seems to be
very prominent in Wildmount. And as the years have

00:08:54.814 --> 00:08:58.686
gone by, that debt has compounded and compounded
to the point where they were threatening to

00:08:58.739 --> 00:09:04.944
take everything from the Darrington family and
toss them onto the street. Your father, Howaardt,

00:09:04.944 --> 00:09:11.127
told you that his plan to prevent this from
happening was to marry you off to a very rich and

00:09:11.127 --> 00:09:19.651
powerful family up in the capital in the kingdom,
and you decided to look for other options. You

00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:25.495
went and spoke with a gentleman named Korshad who
was within a secret bar beneath the Grumpy Lily

00:09:25.495 --> 00:09:32.525
tavern where a bunch of, it seems, Myriad and
other lowlives go to drink, be merry, and go about

00:09:32.525 --> 00:09:38.895
their business in a safer environment. You seemed
to talk with him about a possibility of making

00:09:38.895 --> 00:09:44.475
some sort of arrangement, and an accord was made
where if you went and cleansed a nearby platinum

00:09:44.475 --> 00:09:50.776
mine of Herethis, that had seemingly been overrun
with some sort of awoken entity that had prevented

00:09:50.776 --> 00:09:55.283
them from mining the platinum, and are losing a
lot of money-- if you were to destroy this

00:09:55.283 --> 00:10:00.368
creature or cleanse the mines of the threats to
it, they would forgive some of the debt. They

00:10:00.368 --> 00:10:03.691
would still take the lands from the Darrington
family, but they would leave the estate, they

00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:09.415
would leave whatever remains on that land, and
would not mess with them any further, thus ending

00:10:09.415 --> 00:10:14.718
the contract and still leaving a comfortable
lifestyle for the family. You agreed to this, made

00:10:14.718 --> 00:10:19.922
your way to the Herathis platinum mines, delved
deep into the open sinkhole that seemed to consume

00:10:19.922 --> 00:10:26.092
a portion of its construct, and discovered what
had awoken within, a strange, once-seeded

00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:31.913
celestial that had been awoken too early and too
young. As such, its weird, angelic, baby-like

00:10:31.913 --> 00:10:37.928
form had withered and twisted, and in battling the
celestial, which manipulated the terrain around

00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:41.663
you, you managed to defeat it and destroy it
before it could escape, gathered some of its

00:10:41.663 --> 00:10:50.073
remaining glittery ashes, if you will, and
proceeded to fly up through the sinkhole as the

00:10:50.073 --> 00:10:55.477
rest of the ankheg swarm that seemed to parade
through the tunnels within began to swarm up the

00:10:55.477 --> 00:11:01.550
sides and spit acid at you as you escaped out the
top. Into the moonlit sky looking down below,

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:07.057
you could see the swarm now crawling up and out of
the maw of this mine, and that's where we left

00:11:07.057 --> 00:11:15.945
off. So as you've all just emerged out of the
central portion of the mine, taking a deep breath

00:11:15.945 --> 00:11:20.814
as you're now suddenly out of the immediate
danger, you can look down and see the dozens of

00:11:20.814 --> 00:11:26.919
large insectoid-like ankhegs now clambering up to
the top on the edge, some of them seemingly

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:33.148
shooting jets of acid too far away to make any
impact, but they are intent definitely on trying

00:11:33.148 --> 00:11:38.898
to either shoo you off of their territory or hit
at some sort of lucky impact.

00:11:38.898 --> 00:11:41.041
What do you guys want to do?

00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:47.727
SAM: I, Taryon Darrington, would like to call to
the rest of the gang and say:

00:11:47.727 --> 00:11:51.850
Wait, before we fly away, hold.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.277
TALIESIN: Superman.

00:11:55.277 --> 00:11:59.011
SAM: Oh, okay. Thought it was some sort of power
move.

00:11:59.011 --> 00:12:02.726
LAURA: How are we positioned, again?

00:12:02.726 --> 00:12:09.441
MATT: So you have the broom riders. You have
Percival on your broom. You're flying with your

00:12:09.441 --> 00:12:12.136
wings. And everyone else is on the carpet.

00:12:12.136 --> 00:12:13.371
LAURA: Okay.

00:12:13.371 --> 00:12:21.930
SAM: I would like to just sort of shout to my
friends. Oi, can we, just before we go, could we

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:31.686
maybe just swoop down one more time? Just a quick
flyby. I have an idea. I feel like we need just an

00:12:31.686 --> 00:12:37.470
insurance policy when we go talk to the Myriad
fellow. I was wondering if Kiki here could maybe

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.239
throw a spell down before we leave? Is that
something?

00:12:40.239 --> 00:12:42.009
TRAVIS: You just go down by yourself, right?

00:12:42.009 --> 00:12:43.381
LAURA: Do you have any spells left?

00:12:43.381 --> 00:12:45.691
MARISHA: I do still have some spells left. It
depends on what you want to do, though, and what I

00:12:45.691 --> 00:12:46.631
have prepared.

00:12:46.631 --> 00:12:53.820
SAM: Well here's a question: can you make it look
like the mouth of the cave isn't there anymore?

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.421
Has caved in or is covered in dirt or rocks or
something?

00:12:58.421 --> 00:13:04.436
MARISHA: I can. I have a few options for that.

00:13:04.436 --> 00:13:06.564
LAURA: Why do you want that?

00:13:06.564 --> 00:13:15.434
SAM: As I said, I feel like when we talk to the
Myriad fellow-- oh wait, let me fly over to you.

00:13:15.434 --> 00:13:18.058
(laughter)

00:13:18.058 --> 00:13:22.825
SAM: I feel like when we talk to the Myriad
fellow, we have lost our bargaining position at

00:13:22.825 --> 00:13:28.818
this point, because we did what he asked. But if
we hide the mouth of the cave from him, then we

00:13:28.818 --> 00:13:33.955
have information that he needs, like where did it
go, how do you get in, that kind of thing. I was

00:13:33.955 --> 00:13:40.993
also hoping maybe dear Pike could leave some sort
of a trap, again as just an insurance policy.

00:13:40.993 --> 00:13:42.693
ASHLEY: Like a glyph situation?

00:13:42.693 --> 00:13:47.167
SAM: Yes, some sort of a thing that would explode
when someone comes by. But I know it's crawling

00:13:47.167 --> 00:13:50.904
with characters down there, so I don't-- should we
wait? I don't know.

00:13:50.904 --> 00:13:52.535
ASHLEY: I could do such a thing.

00:13:52.535 --> 00:13:57.033
MARISHA: I can do a Hallucinatory Terrain, which I
could do right now because I do have it learned.

00:13:57.033 --> 00:14:04.532
It covers a 150-foot cube, which I don't know--
How wide is the hole?

00:14:04.532 --> 00:14:11.990
MATT: Is it a 150-foot cube? That would cover
pretty much the sinkhole itself. Do keep in mind

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.620
the agreement was to cleanse the mine, not just of
the creature but of the infestation.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.741
LAURA: Oh, we have to kill all the fuckers?

00:14:19.741 --> 00:14:24.346
MATT: Or at least enough to the point where the
infestation is no longer an issue.

00:14:24.346 --> 00:14:27.934
TRAVIS: Tary, can you tinker up some Raid real
quick?

00:14:27.934 --> 00:14:31.472
SAM: I cannot. Wait, we have to kill more of these
fuckers?

00:14:31.472 --> 00:14:34.597
LAURA: Maybe we just get high enough that they
can't get to us with the acid, and then we just

00:14:34.597 --> 00:14:36.980
fire things down at them.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.443
LIAM: Roughly speaking, how many of those did we
see when we came up?

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:44.832
MATT: You saw probably close to a hundred. There
were a few that you destroyed on the way up, or

00:14:44.832 --> 00:14:51.210
some that got wrecked. But you probably have
somewhere in the neighborhood of I'd say anywhere from

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:55.194
60 to 70 that are now visibly coming up the wall.
You can see in the moonlight--

00:14:55.236 --> 00:14:56.758
you can see the walls moving.

00:14:56.758 --> 00:15:02.662
MARISHA: Well, we can if we gather them in one
place. Are they attracted to anything like shiny

00:15:02.662 --> 00:15:04.252
things or movement?

00:15:04.252 --> 00:15:05.620
TRAVIS: We need bait.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.594
TALIESIN: Us.

00:15:06.594 --> 00:15:12.684
MATT: You're not sure. They seem to have been
drawn by the sounds and the movement of the combat

00:15:12.684 --> 00:15:17.184
you had at the bottom of the cavern. It took them
long enough for the battle you had to get down

00:15:17.184 --> 00:15:23.646
there, and now they're skittering back up the wall
as you guys, with your torchlight, are making your

00:15:23.646 --> 00:15:25.031
way up towards the bank

00:15:25.031 --> 00:15:27.676
TALIESIN: I might just start shooting there if
they keep coming.

00:15:27.676 --> 00:15:31.411
LIAM: T.D., do you have anything that lets you
teleport us all?

00:15:31.411 --> 00:15:38.487
SAM: No. Not really. I can become invisible and
fly down there.

00:15:38.487 --> 00:15:43.260
TALIESIN: Do you have any good terrain modifier
something to trash them?

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:57.203
MARISHA: So they're attracted to movement and
sound. Percy, you have a very loud banging thing.

00:15:57.203 --> 00:15:58.090
TALIESIN: I do.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:01.675
MARISHA: If we can get them all clumped together,
I can throw down a few Fireballs and Flaming

00:16:01.675 --> 00:16:05.918
Spheres and probably take a lot of them out. But I
need them clumped together.

00:16:05.918 --> 00:16:14.171
TALIESIN: What do we have that's dead in the Bag
of Holding right now? Let's just start throwing

00:16:14.171 --> 00:16:17.352
them down some things to eat and I'm going to
start making some noise.

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:18.884
MARISHA: Are they still on the walls?

00:16:18.884 --> 00:16:22.596
MATT: You can see a lot of them are still making
their way towards the mouth of the cavern. There's

00:16:22.596 --> 00:16:26.263
probably about 25 or so that are gathered around
the outside. Some of them are spreading a little

00:16:26.263 --> 00:16:29.883
bit out, trying to get towards where you are on
the edges of the hole. If you wanted to move

00:16:29.883 --> 00:16:31.688
towards the top, you might draw them towards the
edge.

00:16:31.688 --> 00:16:34.424
TALIESIN: Let's fly above it and I'll take a few
shots and we'll just start dropping things down.

00:16:34.424 --> 00:16:41.570
LIAM: One other idea. What if I go in as bait,
make a lot of noise, and as they swarm I throw

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:46.970
Whisper and throw it into his shoulder blades, and
then on I'm piggyback.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:53.200
LAURA: No. What? Why? They're already at the top.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:59.718
LIAM: Yes, but would the Fireball, where they are,
encompass them all or-- I'm just saying if they--

00:16:59.718 --> 00:17:02.164
MARISHA: Not all of them, but I can get a lot of
them.

00:17:02.164 --> 00:17:03.619
SAM: I can also throw some Fireballs.

00:17:03.619 --> 00:17:05.385
MARISHA: Yeah, we can Fireball together.

00:17:05.385 --> 00:17:07.142
LAURA: Percy and I just fly up and we start firing
down.

00:17:07.142 --> 00:17:09.063
TALIESIN: I'm going to start making noise and just
boom-booming.

00:17:09.063 --> 00:17:15.828
MARISHA: I point to a spot for Percy to see if I
can get them to gather there, and I start readying

00:17:15.828 --> 00:17:17.110
a Fireball to launch.

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:20.988
MATT: Okay, so the two of you fly over to that
side, and you start making Bad News explosion

00:17:20.988 --> 00:17:24.678
clatter as your gargantuan firearm just (gunshot
noises).

00:17:24.678 --> 00:17:26.919
TALIESIN: Yeah, some shots at them as I go.

00:17:26.919 --> 00:17:31.181
MATT: And you take one or two of them down through
repeated shots as their armor cracks and breaks

00:17:31.181 --> 00:17:32.786
and you hear (dying noises).

00:17:32.786 --> 00:17:35.178
TALIESIN: We'll throw some meat down there too.

00:17:35.178 --> 00:17:39.605
LIAM: Is the noise centered on your gun, though,
and not down below?

00:17:39.605 --> 00:17:42.449
LAURA: Yeah, but they'll gather in the spot to get
to it.

00:17:42.449 --> 00:17:45.973
MATT: They watch as you fly above, and you can
start see them shooting these jets of acid in the

00:17:46.018 --> 00:17:50.642
arc as it begins to spray through, and you mark a
little bit to stay just out of that range as you

00:17:50.642 --> 00:17:55.425
continue to do so. But the noise you are making
is-- you're watching them slowly cluster up

00:17:55.425 --> 00:17:57.102
beneath where you guys are.

00:17:57.102 --> 00:18:01.114
MARISHA: Okay, let me know when it looks like a
good cluster.

00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:09.064
MATT: You got a pretty good cluster, you could
probably get about ten in one blast.

00:18:09.064 --> 00:18:15.029
MARISHA: Yeah, let's just throw down a big ol'
Fireball.

00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:16.689
MATT: All righty.

00:18:16.689 --> 00:18:21.245
MARISHA: 20-foot radius.

00:18:21.245 --> 00:18:23.340
SAM: (sings) You shake my nerve--

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.650
TRAVIS: (sings) -- and you rattle my brain.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.601
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: (sing) Too much love drives a
man insane.

00:18:28.601 --> 00:18:36.345
ALL: (sing) You broke my will, oh, what a thrill.
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

00:18:36.345 --> 00:18:39.887
MATT: And with that, for the sake of brevity on
this standpoint, you wait until they begin to

00:18:39.887 --> 00:18:45.277
gather into one space, and with a singular
Fireball, Keyleth, you watch as (explosion) you

00:18:45.277 --> 00:18:51.337
send four of them screeching down, falling into
the pit from the blast, while six of them appear

00:18:51.337 --> 00:18:56.385
to be heavily wounded or burned to a cinder and
run off screaming, before collapsing and then

00:18:56.385 --> 00:19:01.998
smoldering maybe 20 feet from the pit. More swoop
up to gather into that space, now that that

00:19:01.998 --> 00:19:06.649
explosion has drawn their attention as well. And
you see a few stop for a second, smelling the ruin

00:19:06.649 --> 00:19:11.532
of their companions, and you see a moment there to
shoot another Fireball as soon as they're

00:19:11.532 --> 00:19:16.875
gathered. (explosion) This one finishes off any of
the stragglers there and heavily damages a handful

00:19:16.875 --> 00:19:20.836
of others. You watch now, over the period of time
of you both shooting, you taking arrows and what's

00:19:20.836 --> 00:19:26.326
available, over the next five to six minutes or
so, you guys cut down the numbers to about half

00:19:26.326 --> 00:19:31.283
what they were. And there's now just broken
wreckage of ankhegs just torn open from the

00:19:31.283 --> 00:19:38.678
explosion, their chitinous armor fractured and
open with the smoldering innards burning and

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:45.181
sizzling from the impact of the fire. They start
to slow their ascent as more and more of them

00:19:45.181 --> 00:19:48.368
begin to die, and you watch as they all begin to
burrow back into the earth,

00:19:48.368 --> 00:19:51.933
scattering deeper into the ground.

00:19:51.933 --> 00:19:56.194
MARISHA: Hey... Vax, do you still have any of
that--

00:19:56.194 --> 00:19:57.771
LAURA: You had to think about it.

00:19:57.771 --> 00:20:00.283
(laughter)

00:20:00.283 --> 00:20:05.166
MARISHA: A hundred episodes, yeah. Five years, a
hundred episodes later. Do you still have any of

00:20:05.166 --> 00:20:09.243
that poison? That poison-- anybody have any
poison?

00:20:09.243 --> 00:20:10.778
TRAVIS: I do!

00:20:10.778 --> 00:20:11.769
MARISHA: You have poison?

00:20:11.769 --> 00:20:13.229
TRAVIS: Yep! Yep, do you want some?

00:20:13.229 --> 00:20:14.458
MARISHA: Well, I was thinking--

00:20:14.458 --> 00:20:17.574
TRAVIS: You got it. I pull out the jug and I yell,
"Poison!"

00:20:17.574 --> 00:20:20.346
MATT: Splashes around inside.

00:20:20.346 --> 00:20:21.697
MARISHA: That's pretty good, Grog.

00:20:21.697 --> 00:20:22.924
TRAVIS: Did you want to drink it?

00:20:22.924 --> 00:20:25.157
MARISHA: Well, no.

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:27.129
TRAVIS: No. It's really hardcore, if you do.

00:20:27.129 --> 00:20:35.111
MARISHA: Ah, another time. I'll raincheck you,
bud. Do we still have any more orc or boar parts?

00:20:35.111 --> 00:20:39.866
TRAVIS: No, we've got an orc, like, calf, and a
foot, and it looks like a skull,

00:20:39.866 --> 00:20:41.786
covered in like, pasta sauce.

00:20:41.786 --> 00:20:46.705
MARISHA: Yeah, like actual Raid. Like Raid. Like
if we dip, maybe, some food in poison and throw it

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:50.698
down there, everyone that's left will come and
eventually eat it and die.

00:20:50.698 --> 00:20:55.951
LAURA: I think we have, like, 40 or 50 of them
left, right? And they're burrowed, now?

00:20:55.951 --> 00:21:00.726
MATT: Some of them have burrowed and some have
gotten wind of the wreckage and ruin--

00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:04.629
LAURA: (gasps) I wonder if we could send fire into
the caves where they've burrowed?

00:21:04.629 --> 00:21:08.641
LIAM: Or you've created tsunamis, as well, d'you
think you could flush them out?

00:21:08.641 --> 00:21:14.939
MARISHA: I could-- I do still have my sixth-level
spell, I could attempt to get to a few of their

00:21:14.939 --> 00:21:17.311
tunnels and collapse their tunnels.

00:21:17.311 --> 00:21:20.050
SAM: Can you fill the whole tunnel with water and
drown them?

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.451
MARISHA: I could--

00:21:22.451 --> 00:21:25.405
SAM: Too big. Too big.

00:21:25.405 --> 00:21:27.238
LAURA: What's too big?

00:21:27.238 --> 00:21:29.073
SAM: To fill the whole tunnel with water and drown
'em?

00:21:29.073 --> 00:21:30.411
LAURA: That's a lot.

00:21:30.411 --> 00:21:32.652
TALIESIN: We can't create chemicals, can we?

00:21:32.652 --> 00:21:37.128
SAM: (laughs) Your mind.

00:21:37.128 --> 00:21:44.456
MARISHA: Hm, no, not really. I can create water,
but I don't think

00:21:44.456 --> 00:21:46.989
it would be enough to flush them out.

00:21:46.989 --> 00:21:49.170
TRAVIS: I just made this poison for, like, no
fucking reason?

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:51.427
(laughter)

00:21:51.427 --> 00:21:53.936
TALIESIN: We could do shots. I'm just kidding.

00:21:53.936 --> 00:21:56.802
MARISHA: I mean, you volunteered it very quickly.

00:21:56.802 --> 00:22:01.049
TRAVIS: Are we just above the hole?

00:22:01.049 --> 00:22:02.880
MATT: You're above the hole, holding the jug--

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:09.209
TRAVIS: I take initiative and I take the orc leg,
dunk it in the poison, toss it, then I take the

00:22:09.209 --> 00:22:12.069
last-- this is the last orc piece in the bag--

00:22:12.069 --> 00:22:15.861
MARISHA: Is that remnants of Dork, still?

00:22:15.861 --> 00:22:20.908
TRAVIS: I dunno. No, no. The ox is way gone, that
poor bastard.

00:22:20.908 --> 00:22:23.034
TALIESIN: We burned through that ages ago.

00:22:23.034 --> 00:22:25.954
TRAVIS: Two little orc parts, now poisoned and...

00:22:26.015 --> 00:22:32.271
MATT: Yeah. Two-- they're very soft. Very, like,
long-cooked lamb, just dripping off the bone,

00:22:32.271 --> 00:22:33.811
you're like-- throw it off there--

00:22:33.811 --> 00:22:35.966
LAURA: We might have some stuff in the Bag of
Colding.

00:22:35.966 --> 00:22:39.043
MATT: Were they in the Bag of Colding? No. They're
definitely soft.

00:22:39.043 --> 00:22:43.312
MARISHA: If I do like, a Commune with Nature, and
then, because I know they're already--

00:22:43.312 --> 00:22:45.043
MATT: Build a commune with nature?

00:22:45.043 --> 00:22:48.899
MARISHA: Commune with Nature, and I--

00:22:48.899 --> 00:22:51.123
LIAM: Whoa. Glass houses, and all of that.

00:22:51.123 --> 00:22:54.343
MATT: I like the image of a spell that-- I just
like a spell that creates a hippie commune

00:22:54.343 --> 00:22:56.897
somewhere in your fantasy world. I think it's
pretty cool.

00:22:56.897 --> 00:23:01.957
MARISHA: I thought that was Conjure Fae.

00:23:01.957 --> 00:23:04.486
MATT: True enough. Continue, what are you doing?

00:23:04.486 --> 00:23:11.162
MARISHA: Can I, because I already got a map of
their tunnels. Can I then do Move Earth to, like,

00:23:11.162 --> 00:23:13.763
try and collapse?

00:23:13.763 --> 00:23:16.709
MATT: You get the sense that as burrowing
creatures, collapsing the tunnels might slow them

00:23:16.709 --> 00:23:18.475
down, but they'll probably still dig their way
out.

00:23:18.475 --> 00:23:22.177
TALIESIN: What are the chances I have materials
for making explosives on me?

00:23:22.177 --> 00:23:26.011
MATT: I mean, enough to maybe, like--

00:23:26.011 --> 00:23:29.683
TALIESIN: No, but like just the materials, not the
time to make them, but just the materials. Because

00:23:29.683 --> 00:23:34.784
one of the materials in making TNT is diatomaceous
earth. And if it's micronized diatomaceous earth,

00:23:34.784 --> 00:23:36.811
that means it's actually an insecticide.

00:23:36.888 --> 00:23:39.302
TRAVIS: Fucking Taliesin Jaffe. What are you
talking about?

00:23:39.302 --> 00:23:41.526
TALIESIN: Specifically for hard-shell insects.

00:23:41.526 --> 00:23:43.878
ASHLEY: I have an idea! I have an idea.

00:23:43.878 --> 00:23:46.680
SAM: Pike has an idea!

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.683
MATT: You wouldn't have anywhere near enough to do
what you're trying to do.

00:23:48.683 --> 00:23:50.248
ASHLEY: I'm going to--

00:23:50.248 --> 00:23:53.047
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait!

00:23:53.047 --> 00:23:54.363
MATT: Pike?

00:23:54.363 --> 00:23:56.348
ASHLEY: I would like to cast Earthquake--

00:23:56.348 --> 00:23:57.666
MATT: Okay.

00:23:57.666 --> 00:23:59.303
ASHLEY: And maybe I can wiggle it all closed.

00:23:59.303 --> 00:24:04.972
MATT: Okay. Okay. So you cast Earthquake, what's
the casting time on that?

00:24:04.972 --> 00:24:07.874
ASHLEY: It's just one action.

00:24:07.874 --> 00:24:14.169
MATT: Okay. So you look there and focus for a
second, close your eyes, and you guys watch as the

00:24:14.169 --> 00:24:23.865
edges of the sinkhole begin to shift. The single
tower that was partially collapsed? Collapses into

00:24:23.865 --> 00:24:27.785
full bits of rock and rubble, and some of it
spills further into the tunnel as the tunnel

00:24:27.785 --> 00:24:34.536
begins to cave in. Basically, you fill in the rest
of the sinkhole, and the mine now drops 25, 30

00:24:34.536 --> 00:24:42.201
feet as the rest of the earth comes and fills it
in. Eventually, the rumbling slows and comes to a

00:24:42.201 --> 00:24:46.072
calm, and you see now there's a dip where the
space in the forest was-- it's like a big bowl,

00:24:46.072 --> 00:24:51.387
and some of the trees fall into it and get buried
in the earth and stone as it collapses inward.

00:24:51.387 --> 00:24:58.883
LIAM: I love that everybody was up here bickering
and Pike just went "hm."

00:24:58.883 --> 00:25:02.005
(laughter)

00:25:02.005 --> 00:25:08.146
MATT: A few moments pass, and you watch as some of
the ankhegs begin to pop out, like the collapsed

00:25:08.146 --> 00:25:12.455
tunnels have forced them to begin burrowing their
way to the surface to orient themselves. You watch

00:25:12.455 --> 00:25:20.329
as about five, ten, 20 or so of these begin to
emerge, and as they emerge they look around the

00:25:20.329 --> 00:25:23.871
space. And you watch them looking at each other
and sniffing the area--

00:25:23.871 --> 00:25:26.814
ASHLEY: I'm going to Fire Storm them.

00:25:26.814 --> 00:25:29.490
MARISHA: You're going to Fire Storm them?

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:32.940
TRAVIS: Just let Pike off the leash.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.488
SAM: Oh, by the way, I can create a holocaust? Is
that what you're doing?

00:25:37.488 --> 00:25:41.094
(laughter)

00:25:41.094 --> 00:25:45.448
MATT: (sings) Pike can end this world in a
holocaust, in a holocaust-- All right, so. As

00:25:45.448 --> 00:25:53.040
everyone's marveling over your Earthquake, little
Pike goes, "And also--" And you watch as about 30

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.222
or so of these creatures have now emerged, and
they're all communicating with each other, and their

00:25:56.222 --> 00:26:00.892
antennas are going by, and they're beginning to
look around-- and this streak, this zigzag of

00:26:01.056 --> 00:26:10.265
burning flame just tears across the base of this
bowl and just incinerates about 20 of them. You

00:26:10.265 --> 00:26:15.851
now see them immediately smoldering, turning to
ash, these blackened clusters of heavily charred

00:26:15.851 --> 00:26:22.335
husk, and the others that came to the surface just
scatter into the forest. You get the sense that

00:26:22.335 --> 00:26:28.150
the ruin you've left, the collapsing of the
tunnels and the rather large portion of their

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:32.862
populace that you've left destroyed, there's
probably not much of an infestation

00:26:32.862 --> 00:26:34.508
left here in the mines.

00:26:34.508 --> 00:26:35.950
TRAVIS: Yeah, not too bad, Vasquez.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:37.576
LAURA: Did we also destroy the mine?

00:26:37.576 --> 00:26:40.447
TALIESIN: Well, it's still there, it's just been
filled in.

00:26:40.447 --> 00:26:47.313
MARISHA: Plus, technically isn't the point of a
mine to, like, dig out holes?

00:26:47.313 --> 00:26:52.093
TALIESIN: Now they can dig extra. The
Etch-A-Sketch has been shaken.

00:26:52.093 --> 00:26:55.204
LIAM: There's none left? They're all gone?

00:26:55.204 --> 00:26:58.040
MATT: I mean, that you saw come to the surface
gathered.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.130
LAURA: I think we did a good job.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:02.541
LIAM: We could've smushed those and gotten so
drunk.

00:27:02.541 --> 00:27:05.175
ASHLEY: How do you feel, Tary?

00:27:05.175 --> 00:27:10.812
SAM: That's pretty awesome. (laughs) Yeah, I think
mission accomplished. Let's go.

00:27:10.812 --> 00:27:15.605
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think we did it. Let's get the
fuck out of here.

00:27:15.605 --> 00:27:22.938
MATT: Okay. So. You guys make your way back
towards Deastok-- Yes. Make your way back towards

00:27:22.938 --> 00:27:30.292
Deastok. You still have access to your Wind Walk,
since it's not concentration, it lasts a while, so

00:27:30.292 --> 00:27:35.189
quickly enough, with your equipment in place, you
guys can traverse rapidly back to the city in

00:27:35.189 --> 00:27:44.141
which you began this journey. You make your way
back to The Grumpy Lily, introduce yourself to the

00:27:44.141 --> 00:27:47.306
two denizens within, with the phrase, if you
recall.

00:27:47.306 --> 00:27:51.811
TRAVIS: Chicken and biscuits.

00:27:51.811 --> 00:27:53.934
SAM: The Many, the Many, yes.

00:27:53.934 --> 00:27:58.473
MATT: The same elderly gentleman is like, "Well,
okay," and shuffles over and opens the same

00:27:58.473 --> 00:28:02.734
doorway that leads you through the stairs, into
the central hallway where there's that one gruff

00:28:02.734 --> 00:28:09.295
guy on the stool, he recognizes you, nudges you
and opens the door. And you step into the tavern.

00:28:09.295 --> 00:28:13.771
It's not as busy as it was last time, it's 
probably about maybe two-thirds of the clientele

00:28:13.771 --> 00:28:18.215
there, but the music's still going, there's people
chatting, having drinks, and at a different table

00:28:18.215 --> 00:28:26.503
you see Korshad just sitting alone, hands still
crossed, cup half-full, still resting beneath him.

00:28:26.503 --> 00:28:32.336
And as soon as you enter, his eyes are trained on
you. Whether it was expectant or just sheer luck,

00:28:32.336 --> 00:28:36.557
or his eyes are always trained on whoever enters
the door, as soon as you enter the establishment,

00:28:36.557 --> 00:28:41.866
you watch as his smile cracks the sides of his
mouth and his-- the edges of his eyes, the little

00:28:41.866 --> 00:28:45.930
crows' feet curl up a bit. And he motions you
over.

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:48.568
MARISHA: Do you think he has friends? He's always
alone.

00:28:48.568 --> 00:28:52.069
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to start eyeballing the room
while sis goes and talks.

00:28:52.069 --> 00:28:56.298
TRAVIS: Is Camilla still playing music?

00:28:56.298 --> 00:29:00.134
MATT: The musicians are not currently playing.

00:29:00.134 --> 00:29:01.736
LAURA: What time is it now?

00:29:01.736 --> 00:29:09.212
MATT: At this point, it's early morning. I'll say
for the purposes of the hour that you got there,

00:29:09.212 --> 00:29:14.919
best that I can recall, it's like 1:30 in the
morning. It's pretty late.

00:29:14.919 --> 00:29:18.705
SAM: Excuse me, may we sit and talk?

00:29:18.705 --> 00:29:22.164
MATT: "But of course. Have a seat."

00:29:22.164 --> 00:29:29.691
SAM: Thank you. We have done our share of the
bargain, and we're here

00:29:29.691 --> 00:29:34.112
to cash in our chit, as it were.

00:29:34.112 --> 00:29:43.947
MATT: His head looks at you. "You did not leave
but a number of hours ago. Am I to expect that you

00:29:43.947 --> 00:29:47.042
"have completed this task already?"

00:29:47.042 --> 00:29:49.214
LAURA: Yeah, we're really, really good.

00:29:49.214 --> 00:29:52.270
MARISHA: And you should know that if you've
apparently been watching us?

00:29:52.270 --> 00:30:01.172
MATT: He motions his finger up towards one of the
second rows, and you watch as one of the guards

00:30:01.172 --> 00:30:05.051
there, the ones that you've noticed before and
kept your eyes on that have the hidden crossbows,

00:30:05.051 --> 00:30:09.263
knocks on the edge of a door that opens up
slightly. He whispers to somebody and a few

00:30:09.263 --> 00:30:16.890
moments later another guard walks up, escorting
what looks to be a young mousy woman of red-brown

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:21.790
skin. Her eyes, as soon as you get a glance, are
snow-blind. And you watch as the guard that's with

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:26.532
her is actually holding her arm and guiding her as
she walks. She has big black curls that trail down

00:30:26.532 --> 00:30:33.888
to her middle back and as she's led to the table
Korshad gives a little whistle. And a drink is

00:30:33.888 --> 00:30:39.898
brought at her place and she sits down. Looks a
little confused and nervous, but sits down and

00:30:39.898 --> 00:30:51.300
leans into Korshad, and he turns to her and says,
"This is Duala. She will confirm your words. Duala?"

00:30:51.300 --> 00:31:00.540
She glances her face over past your group
and as she does, she reaches into a pouch and

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:06.597
brings out what looks to be a few stone runes. And
she clatters them across the table. And as soon as

00:31:06.597 --> 00:31:11.567
she puts her fingers out in front and spreads them
like that, the runes all magnetically (scraping)

00:31:11.567 --> 00:31:18.474
shift to match the placement of her fingers below.
Her snow-blind eyes now go pure white. And there's

00:31:18.474 --> 00:31:22.320
just a moment where you watch as her head begins
to drift back like a slow hinge.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.009
MARISHA: Do I recognize this spell?

00:31:24.009 --> 00:31:25.294
MATT: You do not.

00:31:25.294 --> 00:31:26.517
MARISHA: Okay.

00:31:26.517 --> 00:31:35.233
MATT: At least not this form of casting. After a
minute or so, her eyes come back to their

00:31:35.233 --> 00:31:44.889
snow-blind appearance, her fingers curl back in
and with a very small voice she goes, "The mine is

00:31:44.889 --> 00:31:57.853
"cleansed, though the mine is also collapsed."
Korshad's looking at her, and goes, "But you say

00:31:57.853 --> 00:32:10.951
"it is cleansed, yes. Of everything?" She gives a
nod. "It is free." He looks back to you all with a

00:32:10.951 --> 00:32:30.555
very sly, begrudging brow, one eye still partially
closed. "Very well. We will send men to confirm

00:32:30.555 --> 00:32:37.262
"the depths of this, and operations will begin. If
at any point it is discovered that this was some

00:32:37.262 --> 00:32:47.441
"sort of charade or the means of our agreement were
not met fully, we will be happy to make sure the

00:32:47.441 --> 00:32:55.129
"rest of the Darrington estate falls back squarely
under our grasp. However, for the time being and

00:32:55.129 --> 00:33:00.216
"if what you say is true..." He reaches under the
table and sifts through a small sack that he had

00:33:00.216 --> 00:33:11.490
held between his feet and ankles, pulls out a
heavy piece of parchment. "The deed to the

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:17.687
"Darrington estate. Signed over to one Taryon
Darrington."

00:33:17.687 --> 00:33:27.202
SAM: Might I make a few more requests? When last
we spoke, we spoke in vague terms. There was some

00:33:27.202 --> 00:33:37.575
cash talked about, and also a place for my family
to make a little bit of money or food. There's a

00:33:37.575 --> 00:33:45.017
farmhouse nearby our main estate. It's nothing
special, a few acres of land. I would love to keep

00:33:45.017 --> 00:33:49.704
that as well so that we can have a source of food
for the winters.

00:33:49.704 --> 00:33:55.426
MATT: Make a persuasion check, Mr. Doe-Eyed
Young'un.

00:33:55.426 --> 00:33:57.310
LAURA: Blink-blink!

00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:02.827
SAM: 22.

00:34:02.827 --> 00:34:18.153
MATT: 22. "Hmm. You are young. Not yet spoiled by
the strange truths of the world around you. I

00:34:18.153 --> 00:34:25.668
"admire your optimism in the face of the unknown.
It may be your salvation or it may be your end.

00:34:25.668 --> 00:34:29.600
"Only time will tell. I'll give you this
farmland."

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.313
SAM: We are most grateful.

00:34:32.313 --> 00:34:43.116
MATT: "But. If at any point your family comes back
to me requesting any more inches in our agreement,

00:34:43.116 --> 00:34:47.309
"I will happily take it back."

00:34:47.309 --> 00:34:54.110
SAM: Understood. I wasn't quite finished yet,
though.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:59.576
MATT: He leans back in his chair, his arms now
being removed from his mouth and going to an

00:34:59.576 --> 00:35:01.897
expectant cross.

00:35:01.897 --> 00:35:08.354
SAM: What we saw down there in the platinum mines
was the 230,000 gold that we owe you times ten.

00:35:08.354 --> 00:35:14.381
Times 20. What we've just done for you has given
you access to as much money as you could ever

00:35:14.381 --> 00:35:21.882
want, and I feel that's valuable. My family will
require a bit of spending money to get ourselves

00:35:21.882 --> 00:35:29.946
back on our feet. We are... accustomed to a
lifestyle, and we'd like to maintain it for a

00:35:29.946 --> 00:35:35.994
little while at least. I'd say 50,000 gold should
be about enough to last us for a year or two.

00:35:35.994 --> 00:35:41.631
MATT: He nods, leans forward. "Then you'd better
start saving."

00:35:41.631 --> 00:35:53.096
SAM: What if I sweetened the deal? We have among
us an amazing sorceress who could open that mine

00:35:53.096 --> 00:36:01.529
up for you with a flick of her wrist, save you
hours and hours of work. Possibly back-breaking

00:36:01.529 --> 00:36:04.797
work that could cost the lives of many of your
men.

00:36:04.797 --> 00:36:09.651
MATT: "That would be a very kind gesture towards
the state you left the mine in."

00:36:09.651 --> 00:36:16.348
SAM: (clears throat) So that's a maybe?

00:36:16.348 --> 00:36:25.562
MATT: "Let's call it the last thread of my
patience, young Darrington."

00:36:25.562 --> 00:36:27.846
SAM: So that's a hard yes.

00:36:27.846 --> 00:36:29.550
(laughter)

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:35.225
MATT: "Duala, you may return to your quarters."
"Thank you very much." She gets up and looks past

00:36:35.225 --> 00:36:40.181
you all with a nod, and then her guardian escorts
her back into the chamber as Korshad is just

00:36:40.181 --> 00:36:51.004
trained on you. "What I have given you is far more
than many in my position would. I will work hard

00:36:51.004 --> 00:37:01.711
"to make sure that this softness I have displayed
does not hinder my reputation. And the more you

00:37:01.711 --> 00:37:10.590
"press, the more you may be the end of that
softness, my friend. I recommend you stick to the

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:18.462
"deal we've made. Be happy that I've shown any
mercy. And be on your way."

00:37:18.462 --> 00:37:25.828
SAM: All right. I'll make do, and we'll have to
adjust our living standards, that's all.

00:37:25.828 --> 00:37:32.779
MATT: "Indeed. Perhaps your father might raise a
finger or two and earn some money for himself."

00:37:32.779 --> 00:37:41.490
SAM: We'll see. Thank you. Bidet.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:46.215
MATT: "Good evening."

00:37:46.215 --> 00:37:49.178
LAURA: He almost said it back.

00:37:49.178 --> 00:37:50.590
SAM: Almost.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:52.286
LAURA: We're starting something.

00:37:52.286 --> 00:37:56.512
MATT: He takes a drink, and sips it, and gives
this motion with his hand as his eyes finally

00:37:56.512 --> 00:38:01.678
avert from Taryon and the rest of your group and
he looks away with a contemplative expression. As

00:38:01.678 --> 00:38:08.585
he does so, you watch as the guards all begin to
shift out of the crowd. And you watch as many of

00:38:08.585 --> 00:38:12.999
the various tavern folk that were laughing and
drinking are all quiet now,

00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:14.589
looking upon the rest of you.

00:38:14.589 --> 00:38:17.498
TRAVIS: That's some Moriarty shit right there.

00:38:17.498 --> 00:38:21.646
MATT: And you get the sense that pretty much
everybody in this establishment, patron or not,

00:38:21.646 --> 00:38:30.537
are all keeping an eye on this. They're all part
of Korshad's guard in some way, shape or form, and

00:38:30.537 --> 00:38:32.189
you've been given leave.

00:38:32.189 --> 00:38:33.828
MARISHA: You're totally right, he has so many
friends.

00:38:33.828 --> 00:38:34.801
TALIESIN: I told you.

00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:38.965
TRAVIS: Let's do this. Everyone dies. Everybody.
Let's light it up.

00:38:38.965 --> 00:38:46.406
MATT: You watch as Wence comes up to you, as this
is happening, and goes, "Hi. Look. You seem like

00:38:46.406 --> 00:38:48.830
"very nice folk. You should probably..." (clicks
tongue)

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:49.918
LAURA: We're leaving.

00:38:49.918 --> 00:38:54.649
MATT: "Okay, good. Drink for the road?" And he
gives you a little shot, to you, Vex, and goes,

00:38:54.649 --> 00:38:56.280
(tongue click).

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.555
ASHLEY: But why do we have to go? I'm just
kidding.

00:38:58.555 --> 00:39:00.299
(laughter)

00:39:00.299 --> 00:39:02.674
ASHLEY: I just really like it here!

00:39:02.674 --> 00:39:08.088
MATT: And that was the end of Vox Machina's story.
No. All right. You make your way out, back up

00:39:08.088 --> 00:39:16.887
through the Grumpy Lily, back onto the streets of
the deep, deep dark morning hours in Deastok. What

00:39:16.887 --> 00:39:18.531
do you wish to do?

00:39:18.531 --> 00:39:20.729
MARISHA: Wow, that was weird, you guys. It was
weird.

00:39:20.729 --> 00:39:22.202
LAURA: Do we need to tell your family what we did?

00:39:22.202 --> 00:39:23.190
SAM: Absolutely.

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:24.576
LIAM: Break the news to dad, yeah?

00:39:24.576 --> 00:39:26.134
LAURA: Right now. In the morning?

00:39:26.134 --> 00:39:28.948
SAM: I guess maybe in the morning? They're
probably all asleep now.

00:39:28.948 --> 00:39:35.010
LAURA: Well, I haven't actually had the drink yet,
I was afraid it might be poisoned.

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:37.265
SAM: Yeah, maybe not.

00:39:37.265 --> 00:39:39.484
TALIESIN: I'm going to steal a sip of the drink.

00:39:39.484 --> 00:39:41.364
LAURA: (gasps) Percival!

00:39:41.364 --> 00:39:43.443
MATT: Make a con-- no, I'm kidding.

00:39:43.443 --> 00:39:45.061
(laughter)

00:39:45.061 --> 00:39:46.796
TALIESIN: I haven't swallowed it, I'm just going,
hmm, hmm.

00:39:46.796 --> 00:39:48.015
LAURA: How is he?

00:39:48.015 --> 00:39:50.958
MATT: It numbs a bit of the surface skin, seems
like a strong alcohol.

00:39:50.958 --> 00:39:55.884
LAURA: You're fine? All right, fine. All right.
Congratulations, us. Maybe later.

00:39:55.884 --> 00:40:00.427
TRAVIS: We are a little beat up and stuff.

00:40:00.427 --> 00:40:04.225
LAURA: We should probably heal up. Talk to your
father in the morning.

00:40:04.225 --> 00:40:06.029
SAM: We'll go to my house.

00:40:06.029 --> 00:40:07.392
TALIESIN: Your house!

00:40:07.392 --> 00:40:09.056
MARISHA: It is now your house.

00:40:09.056 --> 00:40:10.580
SAM: Yes, it is.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.478
LIAM: Whose house? T's house.

00:40:12.478 --> 00:40:13.901
TALIESIN: Well done.

00:40:13.901 --> 00:40:16.967
LAURA: It's in your name.

00:40:16.967 --> 00:40:19.281
MARISHA: You're a homeowner.

00:40:19.281 --> 00:40:21.291
SAM: I could get a second mortgage!

00:40:21.291 --> 00:40:23.126
LAURA: You could kick your dad out!

00:40:23.126 --> 00:40:25.297
MARISHA: You get to pay property taxes!

00:40:25.297 --> 00:40:26.751
SAM: Oh, god.

00:40:26.751 --> 00:40:28.206
ASHLEY: You could refinance!

00:40:28.206 --> 00:40:31.244
SAM: I could refinance. I hear mortgage rates are
really low right now.

00:40:31.244 --> 00:40:33.567
LAURA: I hear the Myriad's giving really good
deals.

00:40:33.567 --> 00:40:37.696
MATT: So you make your way back to the Darrington
estate?

00:40:37.696 --> 00:40:38.816
SAM: Yes.

00:40:38.816 --> 00:40:47.801
MATT: Okay. The guest quarters are cramped for the
volume of travelers you have with you, but as you

00:40:47.801 --> 00:40:54.431
approach and knock on the door, there's a slight
pause before your...

00:40:54.431 --> 00:40:56.909
SAM: Berthold?

00:40:56.909 --> 00:41:01.195
MATT: Yes, thank you. Berthold, the brass-skinned
dragonborn companion comes up with his nightcap on

00:41:01.195 --> 00:41:08.903
in front of his face, and he's got his little
lantern. He's like, "I assume you wish to stay

00:41:08.903 --> 00:41:16.879
"here. I'll arrange for... Come in, come in." He
rubs his eyes as he leads you inside. It's quiet

00:41:16.879 --> 00:41:22.136
and still, and the house is dark. No light aside
from the small lantern that Berthold has, and he

00:41:22.136 --> 00:41:28.032
leads you on the bottom floor to the guest
quarters, which are two separate rooms, each with

00:41:28.032 --> 00:41:37.054
a singular bed. You watch as he begins to grab
cushions from various chairs and display sofas

00:41:37.054 --> 00:41:42.416
that are covered in dust, that haven't been sat in
for a decade, at least, and is trying to arrange

00:41:42.416 --> 00:41:46.424
them in a haphazard floor bedding scenario.

00:41:46.424 --> 00:41:48.833
TALIESIN: I want to see where he's going with
this.

00:41:48.833 --> 00:41:56.403
MATT: He gets to a point where he gives up and
goes, "Oh, there. Good night." And walks away.

00:41:56.403 --> 00:41:59.301
LAURA: Well, we've slept in blanket forts before.

00:41:59.301 --> 00:42:02.019
LIAM: Not the first, not the last.

00:42:02.019 --> 00:42:04.696
MARISHA: I get the big cushion!

00:42:04.696 --> 00:42:07.088
TALIESIN: It's got a bar in the middle.

00:42:07.088 --> 00:42:09.782
MARISHA: Display furniture sucks.

00:42:09.782 --> 00:42:13.151
MATT: You still do have your room, Taryon, if you
want to use it.

00:42:13.151 --> 00:42:15.805
SAM: My room? Oh, yeah, of course I'm going up
there.

00:42:15.805 --> 00:42:20.287
TRAVIS: Oh, really, you're going to leave us down
here? Fucking high-born piece of shit?

00:42:20.287 --> 00:42:29.693
SAM: All right, I'll stay back down here with the
pillow fort thing. Fine. But after they go to

00:42:29.693 --> 00:42:34.464
sleep, I go upstairs and go back to my bed.

00:42:34.464 --> 00:42:37.300
MATT: Okay, then. Make a stealth check.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.967
SAM: Oh, Jesus. Four.

00:42:39.967 --> 00:42:43.807
MATT: Half of you open an eye in the middle of the
night as you

00:42:43.807 --> 00:42:45.935
hear the creaking of the wood flooring.

00:42:45.935 --> 00:42:47.797
SAM: Just going to the bathroom!

00:42:47.797 --> 00:42:54.016
LIAM: By the way, do you have any beast changing
left in you?

00:42:54.016 --> 00:42:55.890
MARISHA: I do, yeah.

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:57.196
LIAM: Could you go Minxie for me?

00:42:57.196 --> 00:42:58.400
LAURA: Oh, kinky.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.098
TRAVIS: Gross, we're all in the same room.

00:43:00.098 --> 00:43:01.799
MARISHA: Yes, why?

00:43:01.799 --> 00:43:03.376
LIAM: I want a pillow.

00:43:03.376 --> 00:43:05.405
MARISHA: Fine.

00:43:05.405 --> 00:43:08.108
TALIESIN: That is the most Brian Blessed thing
ever.

00:43:08.108 --> 00:43:10.320
LAURA: You could've just used Trinket.

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:14.488
MATT: Trinket farts are an issue. Then again, so
are Minxie farts.

00:43:14.488 --> 00:43:18.018
ASHLEY: I want to get in a circle, like a dog, on
one of the cushions.

00:43:18.018 --> 00:43:19.879
TALIESIN: You turn around three times.

00:43:19.879 --> 00:43:27.027
MATT: That's how rock gnomes sleep, they do a
little circle around the cushion.

00:43:27.027 --> 00:43:30.451
LIAM: I just turn into Macklemore.

00:43:30.451 --> 00:43:39.075
MATT: All right. So you make it to your room, left
as it was. Most of the furniture is covered in

00:43:39.075 --> 00:43:44.756
sheets, but untouched as to where you left it the
last time you were here. There's a firm layer of

00:43:44.756 --> 00:43:49.057
dust across most of it, and as you step into the
room, with each step you can see the footfalls

00:43:49.057 --> 00:43:55.782
leaving a small trail on the floor. You have a
large shelf of books that line the right wall. You

00:43:55.782 --> 00:43:59.446
can see the footsteps to and from the bookshelf
where it seems like your mother has taken, here

00:43:59.446 --> 00:44:04.605
and there, little elements of your collection. You
see the covered outline of your workbench, which

00:44:04.605 --> 00:44:09.256
inhabits the far side of the chamber, and a
familiar smell of old oil and leathers immediately

00:44:09.256 --> 00:44:17.498
causes a flood of memories to hit you of growing
up in this space. You do see, poking out from one

00:44:17.498 --> 00:44:23.844
of these sheets, some of the leftover pieces from
when you constructed your first Doty, and you see

00:44:23.844 --> 00:44:30.051
the armored hand, partially open with some of the
gears and runes only partially put into the hand

00:44:30.051 --> 00:44:34.912
and then discarded and left to the side, and it
also reminds you of those years. You have this

00:44:34.912 --> 00:44:40.910
nostalgic wave hit you as you pull the sheet off
your bed, and dust it out, and fluff your pillow,

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:45.362
and for the first time in a long time, have a
night's sleep in your own chambers.

00:44:45.362 --> 00:44:47.850
SAM: I'll cuddle with the Doty arm.

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:57.152
MATT: It's very cold, but sleep does take you. You
guys finish your evening's rest. You awake. After

00:44:57.152 --> 00:45:01.922
the stress of the previous battle of the day, you
all tend to sleep in for the most part, plus the

00:45:01.922 --> 00:45:08.490
late hour of eventually getting to rest. You all
eventually come to later in the morning, closer to

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:16.620
noon, but as you wake up, you wake up to the smell
of food being cooked. You make your way out into

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:23.533
the central foyer area of the estate, and you can
see Berthold is running around the kitchen,

00:45:23.533 --> 00:45:26.933
desperately trying to put together whatever meal
is viable, and eventually shouts out,

00:45:26.933 --> 00:45:29.185
"Breakfast is served!"

00:45:29.185 --> 00:45:31.590
LIAM: What you got, Bertie?

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:38.768
MATT: "It's... dinner time! Dinner you're having--
breakfast, staying the night,

00:45:38.768 --> 00:45:41.109
"and the market wasn't open."

00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:43.069
LAURA: Potatoes!

00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:50.910
MATT: "Potatoes. Some bread, might be a bit stale.
I made some stew. Breakfast stew. It's just stew,

00:45:50.910 --> 00:46:00.196
"but you're having it for breakfast. Some
mushrooms. That's it. I am sorry."

00:46:00.196 --> 00:46:03.824
LIAM: A lot of carbs.

00:46:03.824 --> 00:46:08.108
TALIESIN: It's like Comic Con all over again.

00:46:08.108 --> 00:46:11.434
TRAVIS: Is this how we're supposed to eat in the
house of Darrington, Tary?

00:46:11.434 --> 00:46:13.969
LAURA: We just used up all of their food and they
don't have any left.

00:46:13.969 --> 00:46:17.610
SAM: I'm sorry. I'll talk to the help about this.

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:21.043
TRAVIS: Can't you pop a crystal off of that helmet
of yours and make a banquet?

00:46:21.043 --> 00:46:24.919
SAM: No. I could burn us all alive, though, with
one of them.

00:46:24.919 --> 00:46:26.354
TRAVIS: Not the same thing.

00:46:26.354 --> 00:46:29.826
TALIESIN: Did we ever discover whether or not the
magic jug does coffee?

00:46:29.826 --> 00:46:32.514
SAM: Only one way to find out.

00:46:32.514 --> 00:46:37.612
TRAVIS: Only one way to find out. Hold on. Be my
guest.

00:46:37.612 --> 00:46:38.916
LIAM: Americano.

00:46:38.916 --> 00:46:42.128
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:46:42.128 --> 00:46:45.100
SAM: How about tea?

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.893
TALIESIN: Tea.

00:46:46.893 --> 00:46:48.722
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:46:48.722 --> 00:46:55.223
MARISHA: It can make alcohol and poison, but it
can't make an English breakfast? Bullshit.

00:46:55.223 --> 00:46:57.394
LAURA: English breakfast ale!

00:46:57.394 --> 00:47:00.757
TRAVIS: Baked beans and sausages and-- ! No.

00:47:00.757 --> 00:47:04.821
MARISHA: Yeah, breakfast ale. That works.

00:47:04.821 --> 00:47:13.346
MATT: As you guys complete your breakfast, you
notice that eventually Maryanne's voice begins to

00:47:13.346 --> 00:47:18.598
echo through the stairway. She comes down and
goes, "My word, Berthold, what are you cooking this-- "

00:47:18.598 --> 00:47:23.718
She comes down. You can see her hair is
curled in front of her face and pulled back and

00:47:23.718 --> 00:47:29.960
tied up into this tight bun in the back, and she's
just wearing this long, deep blue robe over her

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:40.253
casual silk blouse attire and pants. She glances
down, holding onto the railing. "Good morning."

00:47:40.253 --> 00:47:47.599
SAM: Good morning, sister. These are my friends,
Vox Machina.

00:47:47.599 --> 00:47:48.691
ASHLEY: Hello.

00:47:48.691 --> 00:47:49.681
MATT: "Right."

00:47:49.681 --> 00:47:53.600
SAM: Grog, Pike, Vex, Vax, Percy, Keyleth.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:58.464
MATT: "Pleasure. Brother, I wasn't aware we had
company staying."

00:47:58.464 --> 00:48:01.546
SAM: I travel with a group now.

00:48:01.546 --> 00:48:04.333
MATT: "I've heard. I just didn't realize..."

00:48:04.333 --> 00:48:09.284
SAM: I bring news, and I know it's early, but
could we have

00:48:09.284 --> 00:48:11.946
a little family meeting over breakfast?

00:48:11.946 --> 00:48:13.842
LAURA: It's super important.

00:48:13.842 --> 00:48:21.477
MATT: She gives you such a stink eye. "I'll go
speak to Father."

00:48:21.477 --> 00:48:23.270
SAM: And Mama.

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:26.680
MATT: "And Mama." And she heads up the stairs.

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.946
MARISHA: She seems nice.

00:48:28.946 --> 00:48:30.298
SAM: She is not.

00:48:30.298 --> 00:48:32.025
LAURA: I like her a lot.

00:48:32.025 --> 00:48:39.857
MATT: About five minutes pass, and you hear the
sound of multiple footfalls as the rest of the

00:48:39.857 --> 00:48:45.156
Darrington family makes their way down. First you
have Maryanne, same attire, but she's a little

00:48:45.156 --> 00:48:52.090
more put together. You can see now she's left the
robe behind to have more of her classic formal

00:48:52.090 --> 00:49:01.554
presenting-to-company outfit. Behind her you have
Mariya, your mother, who is in practically the

00:49:01.554 --> 00:49:05.305
same outfit she was in yesterday. She really
doesn't seem to care at this point, it's more

00:49:05.305 --> 00:49:06.946
about being comfortable.

00:49:06.946 --> 00:49:08.894
LAURA: Sweat pants!

00:49:08.894 --> 00:49:19.812
MATT: A few feet behind, to his own entrance,
there you see with his thick mutton chops and a

00:49:19.812 --> 00:49:32.973
tied-over, deep red, burgundy coat, Howaardt
Darrington. As they all enter, Mariya immediately

00:49:32.973 --> 00:49:37.846
runs forward and goes, "Oh, I didn't realize
breakfast was going to be made!" She goes over and

00:49:37.846 --> 00:49:44.541
takes a little plate and starts filling it with
rolls and potatoes. She goes up and rubs your head

00:49:44.541 --> 00:49:48.842
a little bit and kisses you on the forehead, and
goes, "It's nice to have company."

00:49:48.842 --> 00:49:51.956
SAM: It's nice to be home.

00:49:51.956 --> 00:49:53.363
LAURA: Did you want some stew?

00:49:53.363 --> 00:49:55.051
MATT: "Oh, yes."

00:49:55.051 --> 00:50:00.138
MATT: Howaardt, at this point, is sitting back
next to Maryanne, and goes (clears throat).

00:50:00.138 --> 00:50:02.940
LAURA: Oh, did you want some as well?

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:15.232
MATT: "I'm fine for now. Your sister tells me that
we are to have a family meeting."

00:50:15.232 --> 00:50:21.387
SAM: Yes, and with your permission, I would like
to invite my friends to stay for it as well, as it

00:50:21.387 --> 00:50:23.440
does concern them.

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:24.889
LIAM: Hey.

00:50:24.889 --> 00:50:26.242
MARISHA: Hi!

00:50:26.242 --> 00:50:27.528
TALIESIN: Charmed.

00:50:27.528 --> 00:50:29.415
MATT: "Very well."

00:50:29.415 --> 00:50:38.895
SAM: I bring you news, and I bring you a proposal,
and as a businessman I hope you'll listen to both.

00:50:38.895 --> 00:50:46.987
MATT: He seems keen at the choice of words. "Yes,
my son."

00:50:46.987 --> 00:50:56.396
SAM: First, the news. It's good news. First, I
will not be marrying this Lydia person. There's no

00:50:56.396 --> 00:51:05.900
need, and also I think we all know I would not be
happy in such a marriage, and we should all be

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:15.919
free to pursue whomever we love. That's beside the
point. It's not necessary, because I have made a

00:51:15.919 --> 00:51:26.860
deal with the Myriad. A deal that will spare us
from any danger, and clear us from all debt. We--

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:34.968
Well, they, really, carried out a task for the
Myriad that has absolved us of the debt that you

00:51:34.968 --> 00:51:38.708
ran up, and we are free and clear.

00:51:38.708 --> 00:51:51.080
MATT: He looks to Mariya and Maryanne and softens
up. "I am... If what you say is true, then this is

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:59.183
"indeed a great day, and I owe each and every one
of you a great debt. We owe you a great debt."

00:51:59.183 --> 00:52:02.265
TALIESIN: Let's not get ahead of ourselves, but
thank you.

00:52:02.265 --> 00:52:09.327
SAM: Yes, they don't-- Forgive me for speaking on
your behalf. I don't think that they want to

00:52:09.327 --> 00:52:17.677
collect on a debt. They just did this because
we're friends. The forgiveness of debt comes with

00:52:17.677 --> 00:52:25.495
some strings attached. We will lose most of our
property and assets, but we will maintain the

00:52:25.495 --> 00:52:34.494
homestead here, and all of its possessions and
artwork and belongings, we get to keep. We also

00:52:34.494 --> 00:52:42.426
get the nearby farmhouse and all of the land, and
we get a new lease on life, and a new beginning. I

00:52:42.426 --> 00:52:53.530
think it's an opportunity for our family, and that
leads me to my proposal. Father, as much as I have

00:52:53.530 --> 00:53:01.263
respected you for keeping us safe and providing
for us, you have not given us the one thing a

00:53:01.263 --> 00:53:10.716
family needs, which is love. Real love. You have
made sure that we are safe, because you care about

00:53:10.716 --> 00:53:16.723
our blood, because it is your blood, and you care
about the fact that we bear your name, but you

00:53:16.723 --> 00:53:24.068
haven't given us the opportunity to be a real
family, and I believe we can be, if we start out

00:53:24.068 --> 00:53:34.214
new and fresh together. Here's my proposal. I will
come back and live with you, in Wildmount, and I

00:53:34.214 --> 00:53:47.902
will lead this family to a new chapter. Our
business model will change a bit. I propose that

00:53:47.902 --> 00:53:54.355
we do not engage in real estate anymore, but in
another venture.

00:53:54.355 --> 00:53:59.789
Forgive me, but you have sullied our name.

00:53:59.789 --> 00:54:05.151
MATT: Maryanne, at this point, says, "No, brother,
you have!" And you watch as Howaardt puts his hand

00:54:05.151 --> 00:54:11.653
out in front and dad-hands her, immediately, and
pushes her back, not stopping his gaze from you.

00:54:11.653 --> 00:54:18.292
His jaw clenches tight as he clears his throat and
his hands go back behind his body.

00:54:18.292 --> 00:54:31.787
SAM: The Darrington name is one of ill repute. We
are scoundrels, and we are land barons, and we are

00:54:31.787 --> 00:54:42.066
awful people, and now we are penniless awful
people. But I feel that we can fix it. What I

00:54:42.066 --> 00:54:52.005
propose is this: Our home will be vacated by us.
We are going to move to the farmhouse, where we

00:54:52.005 --> 00:54:58.288
will all live as a family. We will tend to the
farm, and we will raise crops together. Our home

00:54:58.288 --> 00:55:03.924
will be turned into the Darrington Fund, for
charitable giving, where people who are down on

00:55:03.924 --> 00:55:11.093
their luck can come and live and get back on their
feet. Now, such a fund will need donors, and you

00:55:11.093 --> 00:55:18.954
have many contacts in the business world. You, and
possibly sister, could run this foundation and

00:55:18.954 --> 00:55:23.535
spread goodness all over Wildmount, instead of
badness and evil.

00:55:23.535 --> 00:55:27.990
MATT: There's a flash of movement. Quicker than
you've seen your father move, he has grabbed a

00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:33.620
chair behind him, and thrown it across the room,
smashing it against the nearby wall.

00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:37.806
(heavy breathing)

00:55:37.806 --> 00:55:42.755
LIAM: I take a step forward and unsheathe a dagger
an inch and say, we're going to keep this civil

00:55:42.755 --> 00:55:45.265
today, aren't we?

00:55:45.265 --> 00:55:56.752
MATT: "You have no right to talk to me... You
stand here and shame the work that I've done, and

00:55:56.752 --> 00:56:05.385
"given my life to secure and give to you and your
sister, and to uphold the mistakes that my father

00:56:05.385 --> 00:56:14.644
"made to the best of my ability and fix them. And
you waltz in here after a year of adventuring and

00:56:14.644 --> 00:56:19.628
"just expect me to accept you throwing everything
I've worked for into the sewer?"

00:56:19.628 --> 00:56:26.612
SAM: I didn't do that, Father, you did. It's gone.
Everything is gone.

00:56:26.612 --> 00:56:31.072
You don't even own your own house anymore.

00:56:31.072 --> 00:56:34.880
MATT: "It wouldn't be that way if you would've
just married that girl."

00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:44.201
SAM: That's not going to happen. In my year of
travel, I didn't just dilly-dally around the world

00:56:44.201 --> 00:56:50.726
having fun. I was learning about the world and
about life and about family. I was learning from

00:56:50.726 --> 00:57:02.377
these fine people what it means to really be a
family, and care about each other. I learned from

00:57:02.377 --> 00:57:11.815
Grog and Vax what it means to be a man, and to be
a father. I learned from Pike what it means to be

00:57:11.815 --> 00:57:19.555
a caring mother. I learned from Keyleth what a
real sister is like, one who loves you and cares

00:57:19.555 --> 00:57:28.559
for you. I learned from Vex what a best friend is
like. These are things you never gave us, growing

00:57:28.559 --> 00:57:45.237
up. I even learned from Percival... the type of
man I would want to marry one day. And we never

00:57:45.237 --> 00:57:56.731
got that at home. And from this day forth, I'm
going to create a home, my home, that I own, that

00:57:56.731 --> 00:58:07.369
values and respects the opinions of each family
member. That cares for one another. Where we stick

00:58:07.369 --> 00:58:15.078
up for each other, and help each other through
hard times, and not just rule by decree. If you

00:58:15.078 --> 00:58:21.541
don't want to be a part of this, that's fine. You
can leave my house. But I want you to stay. I need

00:58:21.541 --> 00:58:30.253
your counsel, and I need your help, and we need
you as a father. I need you and Sister to run this

00:58:30.253 --> 00:58:36.439
foundation for me, to repair our name and our
reputation. It could be great. It could be the

00:58:36.439 --> 00:58:52.427
best thing that's ever happened to us. And there's
more. I have an idea. To create something else. A

00:58:52.427 --> 00:59:02.339
team of adventurers, based here in Wildmount. The
Darrington Brigade, led by me, Taryon Darrington.

00:59:02.339 --> 00:59:10.878
We will fight for justice, and win battles against
evildoers, and spread the Darrington name around

00:59:10.878 --> 00:59:23.058
the continent. I know I'm getting ahead of myself,
but I feel like if we embarked on this new

00:59:23.058 --> 00:59:33.641
adventure together, it could save our name and
repair our relationship. As a businessman, I'm

00:59:33.641 --> 00:59:44.039
asking you to consider it. Because your other
options are... Well, they're not great.

00:59:44.039 --> 00:59:47.577
MATT: Make a persuasion check

00:59:47.577 --> 00:59:49.979
LAURA: The deal we made with the Myriad, sir...

00:59:49.979 --> 00:59:51.974
SAM: I'm going to use Luck.

00:59:51.974 --> 01:00:01.096
LAURA: No one would know that you were forced out
of your home. Everyone thinks that this was your

01:00:01.096 --> 01:00:03.280
choice, that you're being charitable.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:07.223
SAM: I'm going to see if the fates can help me.

01:00:07.223 --> 01:00:09.005
TRAVIS: You're going to use it now?

01:00:09.005 --> 01:00:10.878
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:00:10.878 --> 01:00:12.682
MARISHA: Cash it in!

01:00:12.682 --> 01:00:15.977
SAM: That's a 25.

01:00:15.977 --> 01:00:28.597
MATT: That's a moment to do it. You see as Mariya,
your mother, has now moved to the side of

01:00:28.597 --> 01:00:41.536
Howaardt, holding his arm. "Honey, there was no
other path. This is a gift." He pulls his arm from

01:00:41.536 --> 01:00:50.883
her and begins to walk toward you. You watch as
Maryanne has put on a shocked face, gone pale

01:00:50.883 --> 01:00:59.238
white, and for a moment, the facade of the adult
gives away to the child. "Father." As he walks up

01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:09.186
to you, you watch as he brings his hand up, and
falls into his own hand, and falls to his knees on

01:01:09.186 --> 01:01:15.363
the ground. He's shaking, he's quaking. His fist
is clenched there, and he slams it into the

01:01:15.363 --> 01:01:22.197
ground, once, twice, a third time, each one a
resounding knock of him hitting bone and skin

01:01:22.197 --> 01:01:28.891
against wood. And he does it again, and again, and
again, all the anger and fury being focused into

01:01:28.891 --> 01:01:33.539
this. As he stops, you can see the blood pouring
from the side of the knuckles, and his hand is

01:01:33.539 --> 01:01:56.012
shaking. He stops and looks at it. (deep breath)
And for the first time-- not even the other

01:01:56.012 --> 01:02:03.024
evening, in which there was a sort of feigned
softness to him, that you have read through before

01:02:03.024 --> 01:02:15.541
and seen-- for the first time you see your father
as a broken man. He looks up at you. "I lost

01:02:15.541 --> 01:02:45.134
"everything. I did this to us." He looks back at
Mariya, and Maryanne, and to you. The dampness

01:02:45.134 --> 01:02:52.763
gathering down the side of his wrinkled cheeks,
gathering across the stubble on his chin, and

01:02:52.763 --> 01:03:13.442
vanishing amongst the cluster of thin, bristly
facial hair. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

01:03:13.442 --> 01:03:17.230
SAM: I am, too.

01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:25.281
MATT: He looks about at this point. Now, his
focused anger has subsided, and this emotional

01:03:25.281 --> 01:03:31.911
moment realizing that there are strangers at the
table, and he (clears throat) "If you could please

01:03:31.911 --> 01:03:42.500
"give us a bit of time." His hand still clustered
there. He looks over to Berthold, who ushers you

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:55.847
all out front, you staying behind, Taryon. About
ten minutes or so, as you're all awkwardly waiting

01:03:55.847 --> 01:04:07.407
outside in the quiet. The cloudy day that
originally brought you into Deastok is breaking in

01:04:07.407 --> 01:04:12.339
places, you see hints of blue sky peeking through,
and a little bit of sunlight occasionally finding

01:04:12.339 --> 01:04:19.555
its way across the cobblestone roads of the
cityscape. You hear the occasional tweet of birds

01:04:19.555 --> 01:04:25.545
as they jump from tree to tree. And in this
silence you really get to take in the surrounding

01:04:25.545 --> 01:04:31.272
beauty of this town, even as oppressive and gloomy
as your arrival may have been, and the tenseness

01:04:31.272 --> 01:04:44.079
of the work you had to do in this space. You allow
yourself to realize that this is a nice town. You

01:04:44.079 --> 01:04:53.672
hear the door open once more from the front of the
estate, and there you see Maryanne, wet on the

01:04:53.672 --> 01:05:01.635
cheeks. "My father would like to speak to you,
if that's all right."

01:05:01.635 --> 01:05:02.999
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:05:02.999 --> 01:05:04.819
LAURA: Sure, sure.

01:05:04.819 --> 01:05:10.585
MATT: She steps back in and Howaardt comes back.
He is more composed than he was before. He is back

01:05:10.585 --> 01:05:26.736
to his presentory self. "When my son left, I was
under the impression that his fanciful ideas would

01:05:26.736 --> 01:05:40.081
"either break him and send him back to me to
finally listen to what I had to teach, if luck was

01:05:40.081 --> 01:05:50.378
"with us. If not, his fool's errand was bound to
get him killed. It is by some miracle that he

01:05:50.378 --> 01:06:12.105
"found you. I don't know what's in store for my
children, my wife, myself. There is a lot to

01:06:12.105 --> 01:06:38.346
"discuss, a lot to decide. Us as a family. And I'm
still processing all of it. I'm sorry you got

01:06:38.346 --> 01:06:52.906
"pulled into all of this, but I'm glad that you
gave him your friendship. And I'm sorry you had to

01:06:52.906 --> 01:07:08.872
"see this." He's hiding his bad hand under the good
one. "I'm sure in time I'll come to appreciate

01:07:08.872 --> 01:07:28.349
"this. Out of desperation and obsession, I became
my father, something I promised I would never do.

01:07:28.349 --> 01:07:46.237
"And I'm sorry." He looks back over his shoulder at
Tary, who's a few feet behind him. "I'm sorry."

01:07:46.237 --> 01:07:48.772
Then he walks back into the house and just--

01:07:48.772 --> 01:07:50.334
LIAM: Sir.

01:07:50.334 --> 01:07:54.769
MATT: He stops a little bit and looks back over
his shoulder towards you.

01:07:54.769 --> 01:08:00.194
LIAM: Second chances are a gift. I pray you don't
squander it.

01:08:00.194 --> 01:08:07.614
TALIESIN: You're not the first man to panic at the
loss of his shackles. I hope you eventually enjoy

01:08:07.614 --> 01:08:13.187
the freedom that you've just been given from your
legacy.

01:08:13.187 --> 01:08:20.000
MATT: "Legacy." He continues walking into the
house.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.902
ASHLEY: Sir, may I have your hand, please?

01:08:23.902 --> 01:08:32.077
MATT: He stops. "I'm sorry, what?"

01:08:32.077 --> 01:08:39.315
ASHLEY: May I have your hand? Not in marriage, I
worded that strangely.

01:08:39.315 --> 01:08:41.654
Just your hand that's hurt.

01:08:41.654 --> 01:08:48.654
MATT: He's still clutching and hiding it. He gives
you a look of understanding of what you're asking.

01:08:48.654 --> 01:08:56.272
"I appreciate the offer, but this needs to heal on
its own."

01:08:56.272 --> 01:08:58.623
ASHLEY: Understood.

01:08:58.623 --> 01:09:05.700
MATT: "This pain shouldn't be fleeting." And he
walks away inside.

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:11.856
TRAVIS: I have a question. Is there any more
stew?

01:09:12.039 --> 01:09:15.441
TALIESIN: I don't know.

01:09:15.441 --> 01:09:19.391
TRAVIS: My stomach is making noises, I'm so
hungry.

01:09:19.391 --> 01:09:22.472
MARISHA: I feel like we could find better stew. No
offense.

01:09:22.472 --> 01:09:26.393
LAURA: So...

01:09:26.393 --> 01:09:42.739
SAM: Oh, yes. My place is here. I'm coming back to
Whitestone with you, I have to. I have to retrieve

01:09:42.739 --> 01:09:45.094
Doty and my personal belongings.

01:09:45.094 --> 01:09:47.433
LAURA: But we just finished your room!

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:54.004
SAM: Well, I'll come visit. I was thinking, for my
Darrington Brigade, I'll need lots of recruits,

01:09:54.004 --> 01:10:01.731
and maybe I could get some down in Whitestone. You
know, fine fighters and young trainees. I even

01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:08.850
have an idea for my first adventuring partner. I
think if I sold my old armor, I could afford that

01:10:08.850 --> 01:10:14.505
drow for a year, and she lives close by.

01:10:14.505 --> 01:10:20.665
TALIESIN: This is a lot.

01:10:20.665 --> 01:10:27.431
LIAM: I don't think that's a half-bad idea. We're
all very proud of you.

01:10:27.431 --> 01:10:29.098
MARISHA: So proud.

01:10:29.098 --> 01:10:30.790
TALIESIN: It's very impressive.

01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:37.264
MARISHA: I understand legacy and responsibility
and I think it's very admirable of you to

01:10:37.264 --> 01:10:41.055
recognize your place.

01:10:41.055 --> 01:10:51.693
SAM: I've always known that I was not fit to
travel with you all, and I know that you all love

01:10:51.693 --> 01:10:59.843
me, but you don't really like me that much. Oh, I
can be kind of a dick sometime.

01:10:59.843 --> 01:11:02.492
LAURA: I like it! I like dicks!

01:11:02.492 --> 01:11:07.214
MARISHA: A year ago, it was definitely true, but
now...

01:11:07.214 --> 01:11:08.671
TRAVIS: What about the bakery?

01:11:08.671 --> 01:11:12.553
SAM: Oh, the bakery! I'm really bad at baking
too.

01:11:12.553 --> 01:11:14.608
LAURA: No, but you're so good at selling stuff!

01:11:14.608 --> 01:11:16.229
SAM: Yeah, I am.

01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:21.823
LAURA: I feel like some people come in just to see
you and see you smile.

01:11:21.823 --> 01:11:24.765
MARISHA: Yeah, you're definitely the face guy!
You're the good salesman!

01:11:24.765 --> 01:11:26.297
SAM: Sure, sure, that makes sense.

01:11:26.297 --> 01:11:29.252
MARISHA: You can sell anyone on a shitty cake that
you baked!

01:11:29.252 --> 01:11:32.146
SAM: I'll come down and visit a lot.

01:11:32.146 --> 01:11:35.465
ASHLEY: What's a lot?

01:11:35.465 --> 01:11:42.893
SAM: You know, once every year, around Winter's
Crest. Well, I mean, it's a long way, and I can't

01:11:42.893 --> 01:11:44.999
Tree Stride or whatever you call it.

01:11:44.999 --> 01:11:46.700
MARISHA: I can come get you.

01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:51.126
SAM: Listen, let's not do this now. I'm coming
back with you.

01:11:51.126 --> 01:11:53.819
I have to go get my robit. All right?

01:11:53.819 --> 01:12:00.247
TALIESIN: Well, don't expect us to be okay with
this. That's not going to happen.

01:12:00.247 --> 01:12:07.896
MARISHA: I mean, to be fair, Tary does have a
point. I also have a responsibility, and...

01:12:07.896 --> 01:12:09.729
SAM: You're leaving, too?

01:12:09.729 --> 01:12:11.878
TALIESIN: Yes. Well, technically...

01:12:11.878 --> 01:12:13.942
MARISHA: I'm the chief of my people.

01:12:13.942 --> 01:12:15.538
SAM: Oh my god, are we all breaking up?

01:12:15.538 --> 01:12:17.086
LAURA: What?! No!

01:12:17.086 --> 01:12:21.958
ASHLEY: We're not doing this now! What's
happening? What is happening?

01:12:21.958 --> 01:12:25.627
SAM: I didn't mean to do this! I didn't know this
was going to happen!

01:12:25.627 --> 01:12:29.330
TALIESIN: There's no more discussion until there's
food and caffeine. This is madness.

01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:31.201
ASHLEY: We're just hungry! We're just hungry.

01:12:31.201 --> 01:12:33.318
TALIESIN: This is hunger talking.

01:12:33.318 --> 01:12:35.837
TRAVIS: We're just feeling hangry as shit.

01:12:35.837 --> 01:12:38.308
ASHLEY: Everybody needs to calm down.

01:12:38.308 --> 01:12:39.543
TALIESIN: We need brunch.

01:12:39.543 --> 01:12:43.674
TRAVIS: All right. We'll get brunch back in
Whitestone, right, and get out of here?

01:12:43.674 --> 01:12:48.158
LAURA: Let's go to Whitestone. Let's leave. I
don't like this place anymore.

01:12:48.158 --> 01:12:55.728
TRAVIS: Let's go, then. You don't say one word.
No, you shut up.

01:12:55.728 --> 01:13:00.924
SAM: I need to go say good-bye to Mama, that's it,
then I can go, all right?

01:13:00.924 --> 01:13:03.444
TALIESIN: She can come to Whitestone anytime.

01:13:03.444 --> 01:13:06.333
SAM: She literally has no money to travel.

01:13:06.333 --> 01:13:08.107
TALIESIN: We can make it happen.

01:13:08.107 --> 01:13:11.944
TRAVIS: Well, say your goodbyes.

01:13:11.944 --> 01:13:13.930
SAM: All right, I'll go find Mom.

01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:20.148
MATT: She's inside right now. As you walk inside,
she's sitting at the table where everyone had

01:13:20.148 --> 01:13:25.015
breakfast, she's eating what was on her plate,
alone. She turns around.

01:13:25.015 --> 01:13:32.499
SAM: Mama, I'm sorry to spring all of this on you
and I must go back to Whitestone with my friends,

01:13:32.499 --> 01:13:37.261
to tie up some loose ends, but I'll be back soon.
Days, maybe a week.

01:13:37.261 --> 01:13:39.360
MATT: "Be back, please."

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:42.582
SAM: In the meantime, though, can you think about
something for me?

01:13:42.582 --> 01:13:45.173
MATT: "Of course, what do you need?"

01:13:45.173 --> 01:13:57.850
SAM: The charity. Papa and Sister can run it, they
have smarter business acumen than I do, but the

01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:08.772
brigade, I was wondering if you wanted to do it
with me. You have a taste for adventure, you could

01:14:08.772 --> 01:14:15.972
help be our manager! Tend to us when we're
injured...

01:14:15.972 --> 01:14:19.525
MATT: "Taryon, I'm far too old for adventure."

01:14:19.525 --> 01:14:30.576
SAM: I don't think that's true!

01:14:30.576 --> 01:14:32.356
MATT: "As an organizer?"

01:14:32.356 --> 01:14:44.564
SAM: Yes, yes! Remember in Escape from Brave
Mountain? Remember the kindly old wizard who

01:14:44.564 --> 01:14:52.485
stayed back and tended to the injured and fed them
when they were sick with that mystical plague that

01:14:52.485 --> 01:15:04.604
they got? You could be that old-- Yes. Think about
it. Read the book again.

01:15:04.604 --> 01:15:08.721
And when I come back, we'll talk.

01:15:08.721 --> 01:15:18.629
MATT: "All right. But if you're going out and
you're coming back, and I'm to help,

01:15:18.629 --> 01:15:22.172
"bring back a better outfit."

01:15:22.172 --> 01:15:26.338
SAM: Okay! Do you have a color in mind?

01:15:26.338 --> 01:15:31.534
MATT: "Royal blue."

01:15:31.534 --> 01:15:35.876
SAM: On it. I give her a big hug.

01:15:35.876 --> 01:15:39.153
MATT: She gives you a big hug. As she hugs you,
her mouth gets near your ear and she goes,

01:15:39.153 --> 01:15:43.736
"I'm glad you listened."

01:15:43.736 --> 01:15:51.402
SAM: Me too. Mama, this is going to be fun, fun,
fun!

01:15:51.402 --> 01:15:57.622
MATT: She sniffles a bit and pushes you away. "Now
go, go! Hurry back! Be safe!"

01:15:57.622 --> 01:16:00.949
SAM: Maybe! All right, let's go.

01:16:00.949 --> 01:16:05.134
TRAVIS: Do we assume the form of clouds?

01:16:05.134 --> 01:16:10.573
MARISHA: Oh, no, this is probably a Tree Stride
situation. Let's do that.

01:16:10.573 --> 01:16:15.860
TALIESIN: It would have been a very long cloud
stride. Is it even possible to cloud stride?

01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:18.078
MATT: It's possible, it's just going to be a long
journey.

01:16:18.078 --> 01:16:19.477
LAURA: Tree Stride!

01:16:19.477 --> 01:16:22.736
MATT: Transport Via Plants. Tree Stride is a very
different spell.

01:16:22.736 --> 01:16:25.065
MARISHA: Whatever, that one. Sorry, that's the
fifth level one.

01:16:25.065 --> 01:16:27.282
The sixth level teleport... transport...

01:16:27.282 --> 01:16:30.033
MATT: I know what you mean, but I was opting for
clarification. Transport Via Plants.

01:16:30.033 --> 01:16:31.347
I know what you mean.

01:16:31.347 --> 01:16:33.399
MARISHA: It is. Tree Stride just rolls off the
tongue easier.

01:16:33.399 --> 01:16:34.783
MATT: I know it does.

01:16:34.783 --> 01:16:36.754
TALIESIN: Plant Walk. Tree Trip.

01:16:36.754 --> 01:16:38.689
MARISHA: Tree Uber.

01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:40.888
TALIESIN: Treecycle.

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:43.009
Leaft.

01:16:43.009 --> 01:16:46.297
LIAM: Sorry, pull the plug, people, wrap it up.

01:16:46.297 --> 01:16:54.411
MATT: You find the nearest large tree and with a
quick snap of your fingers, a flash of druidic

01:16:54.411 --> 01:17:00.376
energy, you watch as the tree form splits open,
revealing the doorway. On the other side, the main

01:17:00.376 --> 01:17:05.982
thoroughfare of Whitestone. You step through and
find yourself back in your home city.

01:17:05.982 --> 01:17:13.140
MARISHA: On the way out, I give the Sun Tree our
secret handshake.

01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:14.526
TRAVIS: Like, a judo strike?

01:17:14.526 --> 01:17:16.223
SAM: You just killed the tree.

01:17:16.223 --> 01:17:20.536
LIAM: Quivering Palm the Sun Tree.

01:17:20.536 --> 01:17:24.179
TALIESIN: Sun Tree is still doing it the first
time, three years ago.

01:17:24.179 --> 01:17:27.129
MARISHA: It's so slow.

01:17:27.129 --> 01:17:33.493
MATT: You knock on the Sun Tree a little bit,
continue walking. First thing that catches your

01:17:33.493 --> 01:17:41.297
attention, the main square of Whitestone, largely
around the Sun Tree, is fairly empty except for a

01:17:41.297 --> 01:17:45.634
few carts. It's mostly for traversing. There's a
small garden that's in the early stages of being

01:17:45.634 --> 01:17:51.524
set around. As you walk into the main area, you
notice that there's a lot of carts that are

01:17:51.524 --> 01:17:59.414
circling the north end of it, like a small caravan
of sorts. You see a series of wagons, some horses

01:17:59.414 --> 01:18:05.841
that are tied off at a couple of hitching posts off
to the side, and you see what appear to be tents

01:18:05.841 --> 01:18:12.623
and tables with various wares for sale. Fruits,
vegetables, some exotic cloths and tapestries,

01:18:12.623 --> 01:18:14.877
clothing available.

01:18:14.877 --> 01:18:16.271
LIAM: Is this a festival?

01:18:16.271 --> 01:18:17.755
LAURA: Traveling salesmen?

01:18:17.755 --> 01:18:22.003
TALIESIN: My god, it's a shopping episode! I'm so
excited! Just appeared out of nowhere!

01:18:22.003 --> 01:18:25.279
SAM: Do they have something in royal blue?

01:18:25.279 --> 01:18:29.339
TALIESIN: We're going to buy so many imaginary
things, Travis.

01:18:29.339 --> 01:18:31.937
MARISHA: What's happening though, really?

01:18:31.937 --> 01:18:33.943
TALIESIN: No, really, what is happening?

01:18:33.943 --> 01:18:39.095
MATT: You don't recognize any of these people,
necessarily. There's no reason, there's no

01:18:39.095 --> 01:18:44.621
calendar element to it. As you walk up, one of the
nearest Pale Guard is doing a walk-through.

01:18:44.621 --> 01:18:47.248
TALIESIN: What's this all about?

01:18:47.248 --> 01:18:53.340
MATT: "Percival. Now that the trade routes are
open, we're having

01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:55.571
"more caravans to and from Emon."

01:18:55.571 --> 01:18:57.630
MARISHA: It's a farmer's market!

01:18:57.630 --> 01:19:01.511
MATT: "Essentially. We're just keeping the
peace."

01:19:01.511 --> 01:19:05.440
TALIESIN: It's been several years. Why you should
be even vaguely surprised by this reaction is

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:06.921
baffling to me.

01:19:06.921 --> 01:19:09.979
MATT: "It's baffling that you are so comfortable
with it still."

01:19:09.979 --> 01:19:13.528
TALIESIN: Excellent, carry on, keep shopping.

01:19:13.528 --> 01:19:14.996
MATT: "Of course, of course."

01:19:14.996 --> 01:19:17.039
TALIESIN: It's a farmer's market.

01:19:17.039 --> 01:19:18.277
MARISHA: Hi!

01:19:18.277 --> 01:19:24.295
MATT: He walks off. Do you guys want to walk
around?

01:19:24.295 --> 01:19:26.546
TALIESIN: There's a farmer's market!

01:19:26.546 --> 01:19:30.808
MARISHA: I need some fresh halibut right now!

01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:33.639
SAM: Are they selling or are they just setting
up?

01:19:33.639 --> 01:19:41.618
MATT: At this time they're selling. You see some
of the populace has come out. You see delicious

01:19:41.618 --> 01:19:47.541
fruits, some swamp roots, there are some herbal
setups that have things that are from Stillben and

01:19:47.541 --> 01:19:49.548
things that are not indigenous to the Whitestone
area.

01:19:49.548 --> 01:19:51.579
LIAM: Are there heirloom tomatoes?

01:19:51.579 --> 01:19:54.337
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:19:54.337 --> 01:19:56.653
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck. No I'm not, I'm
kidding.

01:19:56.653 --> 01:19:59.213
MATT: Best Luck use ever.

01:19:59.213 --> 01:20:04.063
TALIESIN: I think they're all heirloom tomatoes.
There's no such thing.

01:20:04.063 --> 01:20:15.614
MATT: You find some nice tomatoes. They're real
tasty-looking tomatoes. There's one oddities shop

01:20:15.614 --> 01:20:24.136
that has small baubles and little jewelry,
trinkets that they have for sale. There's a lot of

01:20:24.136 --> 01:20:29.898
dried meats. There's no fresh fish because a lot
of the fishing that's done locally doesn't travel

01:20:29.898 --> 01:20:31.688
very well on caravan.

01:20:31.688 --> 01:20:34.823
MARISHA: Is there flowers? Is there a flower
shop?

01:20:34.823 --> 01:20:40.577
MATT: There is no flower shop on the caravan.
There is a flower shop in Whitestone, but you

01:20:40.577 --> 01:20:43.498
don't really travel to bring flowers, they don't
keep very well.

01:20:43.498 --> 01:20:46.414
TALIESIN: I assume the castle's going to be doing
a run of this anyway,

01:20:46.414 --> 01:20:48.102
but I want to see the trinkets.

01:20:48.102 --> 01:20:56.036
MATT: You walk up and you see a number of
delightful things. You see a small rack of various

01:20:56.036 --> 01:21:05.414
glass vials with various-colored liquids inside.
Some of them seem to be swirling. As you walk up,

01:21:05.414 --> 01:21:11.705
you see this gentleman in his early 40s, this long
handlebar mustache that curls past the edges of his

01:21:11.705 --> 01:21:19.058
jaw, his hair is combed over to one side and
slicked down. As you approach he's like, "Oh, hi!

01:21:19.058 --> 01:21:32.469
"Yes, I've heard of you, you're Vox Machina! Well,
if there's a team looking for the things I have to

01:21:32.469 --> 01:21:34.188
"sell, it would be you!"

01:21:34.188 --> 01:21:36.520
SAM: He's day-drunk.

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:42.411
MATT: "Now." He immediately goes into his spiel.
You watch as some of the other carts nearby begin

01:21:42.411 --> 01:21:49.536
to roll their eyes a little bit. "So! Vox Machina.
First off, how do I do the pleasure?"

01:21:49.536 --> 01:21:52.787
TALIESIN: Quite impressively, actually.

01:21:52.787 --> 01:21:58.221
MATT: "Theobold Cans, by the way. That's my name.
Keep it in mind. Theobold Cans."

01:21:58.221 --> 01:22:03.873
MARISHA: Like the festival. Yeah. Just go with
it.

01:22:03.873 --> 01:22:08.350
TALIESIN: The Theobold festival, it's very
popular.

01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:14.182
MATT: "I have here acquired a few interesting
things that may help you on your journeys. Here."

01:22:14.182 --> 01:22:22.330
He pulls out one of the vials and swirls it for a
second. It has an orange-ish, yellow-ish color to

01:22:22.330 --> 01:22:29.761
it, and as it flows around its side, it has a
thick movement to it, like a syrup. "This liquid,

01:22:29.761 --> 01:22:37.954
"upon being imbibed, will temporarily allow you to
see, read, and speak any language you like!"

01:22:37.954 --> 01:22:40.641
TALIESIN: That's very impressive.

01:22:40.641 --> 01:22:46.869
MATT: "Isn't it, though? So I'll put that one
aside as a possible, yes."

01:22:46.869 --> 01:22:49.353
LIAM: Is that for real, that one?

01:22:49.353 --> 01:22:53.543
SAM: Oh, yes, I should Identify that. I'll
Identify that.

01:22:53.543 --> 01:22:56.691
MATT: You glance over and take a moment to
concentrate. Yes, it is a Potion of Tongues.

01:22:56.691 --> 01:23:00.178
SAM: Okay, great. Thank you for reminding me that
I do that.

01:23:00.178 --> 01:23:06.938
MATT: "Now, these, you might be interested in." He
pulls out what appears to be a set of goggles with

01:23:06.938 --> 01:23:14.766
these thick crystal lenses in the front. "Now,
these, these fit over your eyes, and upon

01:23:14.766 --> 01:23:23.844
"activation, they have the chance of dazzling
somebody and calling them a friend for some time.

01:23:23.844 --> 01:23:41.289
"So. In the maybe pile? This is--" At this point, in the
middle of this conversation, you specifically,

01:23:41.432 --> 01:23:46.801
Vex, you glance over your shoulder as you see the
crowd parting off to the side. There's a large

01:23:46.801 --> 01:23:49.460
figure beelining in your direction.

01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:53.035
LAURA: I nudge my brother.

01:23:53.035 --> 01:23:56.731
LIAM: What the hell?

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:58.614
LAURA: I head-nudge him.

01:23:58.614 --> 01:24:04.694
MATT: You glance over and you see the crowd's being
parted. You see a seven-foot-tall, not quite

01:24:04.694 --> 01:24:12.000
Grog-level but comparable imposing figure, coming
right towards you. You see darker olive skin,

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:18.451
appears to be a set of half-plate armor, no
sleeves, just plate on the chest and on the legs.

01:24:18.451 --> 01:24:26.355
You see short hair that's buzzed on the sides with
a curl of dark in the front, a Superman S curl in

01:24:26.355 --> 01:24:32.952
the front. You see a big broad smile, a tusked
smile. You see orcish blood in this figure as it

01:24:32.952 --> 01:24:35.425
approaches with a big sword across the back.

01:24:35.425 --> 01:24:38.453
LIAM: I take an instinctive step forward, just a
half step in front of Vex.

01:24:38.453 --> 01:24:42.490
TRAVIS: Maybe he'll kill us and we don't have to
shop anymore.

01:24:42.490 --> 01:24:51.366
MATT: As the figure rushes up, apparently drawn by
the sound of the phrase 'Vox Machina'...

01:24:51.366 --> 01:25:00.391
(cheering)

01:25:00.391 --> 01:25:03.105
SAM: No one can see you.

01:25:03.105 --> 01:25:06.542
LAURA: We know it's there, though!

01:25:06.542 --> 01:25:11.651
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:25:11.651 --> 01:25:17.234
JON: There's an enchantment on it. It's actually
this big.

01:25:17.370 --> 01:25:23.880
SAM: Oh god. Oh god! Much, much bigger than
Hardwick!

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:30.183
(laughter)

01:25:30.235 --> 01:25:36.138
MATT: So, as you have been in the process of
specifically keeping an eye out for a group of

01:25:36.138 --> 01:25:44.199
individuals, specifically looking out for the name
or any mention of Vox Machina, you've spent a

01:25:44.199 --> 01:25:48.040
number of hours with no luck, frustrated. But
you've made some friends in talking around, and

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:52.335
then suddenly you hear someone shout the name from
a distance. You glance over and see a cluster of

01:25:52.335 --> 01:25:57.312
individuals that match the descriptions you were
given. You immediately beeline up to them. You

01:25:57.312 --> 01:26:02.203
watch as two similar-looking half-elves spin and
give you the evil eye.

01:26:02.203 --> 01:26:05.315
LIAM: Hey, friend.

01:26:05.315 --> 01:26:06.840
JON: Hi!

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:11.341
LIAM: You look like you're headed this way, did
you need something?

01:26:11.341 --> 01:26:20.367
JON: Yes. I'm looking for some help.

01:26:20.367 --> 01:26:23.548
LAURA: Oh, wow, yeah? What kind of help?

01:26:23.548 --> 01:26:26.173
LIAM: With you so far.

01:26:26.173 --> 01:26:37.502
JON: I'm with a group of these guys and we have a
bit of a problem back in our homeland.

01:26:37.502 --> 01:26:39.984
LIAM: Which is where?

01:26:39.984 --> 01:26:45.228
JON: I have a problem with memory.

01:26:45.228 --> 01:26:48.261
LAURA: Do you remember your name?

01:26:48.261 --> 01:26:51.116
TALIESIN: The phrase 'day-drinking' has already
come up today.

01:26:51.116 --> 01:26:57.710
JON: Well, my name is Lionel Gayheart, but most
people call me Chod.

01:26:57.710 --> 01:26:59.805
ALL: Chod.

01:26:59.805 --> 01:27:04.776
JON: Although, that was my born name, but I call
myself Lionel Gayheart, it's a better name.

01:27:04.776 --> 01:27:06.285
LAURA: It's a much better name.

01:27:06.285 --> 01:27:09.179
LIAM: On the end is '-hard' or '-heart'?

01:27:09.179 --> 01:27:10.526
JON: Gayheart.

01:27:10.526 --> 01:27:12.277
LIAM: Heart.

01:27:12.277 --> 01:27:13.925
TRAVIS: People call him Chode.

01:27:13.925 --> 01:27:15.252
MARISHA: Chode.

01:27:15.252 --> 01:27:16.573
TALIESIN: Lionel.

01:27:16.573 --> 01:27:17.849
LIAM: Right.

01:27:17.849 --> 01:27:26.914
JON: But, so, yeah, we've been having some
problems and we need some help.

01:27:26.914 --> 01:27:29.989
TRAVIS: What kind of problems?

01:27:29.989 --> 01:27:34.026
LIAM: Like opening a peanut butter jar, or how
big?

01:27:34.026 --> 01:27:36.971
LAURA: Or, like, dragon kind of issue?

01:27:36.971 --> 01:27:46.968
JON: Well... More like creepy guys in a big group
issue. I'm with this guy, you guys, you've heard

01:27:46.968 --> 01:27:51.511
of, he's pretty big in our parts...

01:27:51.511 --> 01:27:53.439
you've heard
of the Meat Man?

01:27:53.439 --> 01:27:56.552
(gasping)

01:27:56.552 --> 01:27:57.507
MARISHA: What?!

01:27:57.507 --> 01:27:58.899
TRAVIS: Are you fucking shitting me?!

01:27:58.899 --> 01:27:59.870
LAURA: You!

01:27:59.870 --> 01:28:01.004
JON: You guys know him?

01:28:01.004 --> 01:28:02.488
TRAVIS: Yeah, we know him.

01:28:02.488 --> 01:28:04.382
JON: I thought he was just big in our parts.

01:28:04.382 --> 01:28:05.652
LAURA: Where are you from?

01:28:05.652 --> 01:28:07.808
TALIESIN: Is this what's happening right now?

01:28:07.808 --> 01:28:09.722
MARISHA: Are we all paying attention at this
point?

01:28:09.722 --> 01:28:12.681
MATT: It's hard to miss this guy show up.

01:28:12.681 --> 01:28:15.160
TALIESIN: Was trying to ignore it. Now I'm
failing.

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:17.356
LAURA: I'm going to throw something again at Sam.

01:28:17.356 --> 01:28:22.074
LIAM: Is Shorthalt around right now? Is this a
prank? Is that was this is? Is this a joke?

01:28:22.074 --> 01:28:24.485
JON: I don't know jokes.

01:28:24.485 --> 01:28:26.324
LIAM: Insight check.

01:28:26.324 --> 01:28:27.585
MATT: Insight check.

01:28:27.585 --> 01:28:35.949
LIAM: It's fine. No, it's not fine. That's better.
14.

01:28:35.949 --> 01:28:44.881
MATT: He seems pretty lost on the name Shorthalt,
but seems to be upfront with his intent.

01:28:44.881 --> 01:28:48.574
MARISHA: So, wait, he does know jokes, or he does
know the Meat Man?

01:28:48.574 --> 01:28:50.367
JON: I know the Meat Man.

01:28:50.367 --> 01:28:51.701
MARISHA: But you don't know jokes?

01:28:51.701 --> 01:28:53.011
JON: I don't know jokes.

01:28:53.011 --> 01:28:54.122
ASHLEY: How do you know the Mean Man?

01:28:54.122 --> 01:28:58.054
MARISHA: Do you know Parchment, Boulder, Shears?
Never mind.

01:28:58.054 --> 01:29:03.161
JON: The Meat Man, he's my boss.

01:29:03.161 --> 01:29:04.733
TRAVIS: What? Really?

01:29:04.733 --> 01:29:05.702
JON: Yeah!

01:29:05.702 --> 01:29:10.346
LAURA: Wait, what does he look like? Short guy?

01:29:10.346 --> 01:29:13.836
JON: No, well, he's shorter than me, but, you
know.

01:29:13.836 --> 01:29:17.245
LIAM: Where on yourself does he come?

01:29:17.245 --> 01:29:18.849
LAURA: Is he this size?

01:29:18.849 --> 01:29:20.151
SAM: She's a gnome.

01:29:20.151 --> 01:29:22.560
JON: No, no, he's bigger than that.

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:23.889
LIAM: Excuse me?

01:29:23.889 --> 01:29:24.909
MARISHA: What?!

01:29:24.909 --> 01:29:28.279
JON: It's the Meat Man, you guys seem familiar
with him, you know what he looks like.

01:29:28.279 --> 01:29:30.863
TRAVIS: Is this the Meat Man we know?

01:29:30.863 --> 01:29:33.442
MATT: No, not at all!

01:29:33.442 --> 01:29:35.195
MARISHA: Is he pulling a Dread Pirate Roberts?

01:29:35.195 --> 01:29:37.452
TRAVIS: He's not the Meat Man that we know.

01:29:37.452 --> 01:29:39.643
LAURA: Well, we don't know, maybe it is! Where are
you from?

01:29:39.643 --> 01:29:41.659
MARISHA: Does he wear a beret?

01:29:41.659 --> 01:29:50.380
JON: I'm from an area where-- we're from the
desert. It's like a desert area. We've traveled

01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:55.199
across a very, very far way. It was a long
journey.

01:29:55.199 --> 01:29:56.733
LAURA and MARISHA: Marquet?

01:29:56.733 --> 01:29:57.656
JON: No.

01:29:57.656 --> 01:29:58.871
LIAM: Did you cross the ocean to get here?

01:29:58.871 --> 01:30:02.080
JON: Yes, we crossed the ocean. We were on those
wooden things that have, like--

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:03.052
LAURA: The ships?

01:30:03.052 --> 01:30:04.603
JON: Yeah, ships! That's it!

01:30:04.603 --> 01:30:07.182
MARISHA: Ank'harel? Bigger than Marquet.
Ank'harel?

01:30:07.182 --> 01:30:08.383
JON: Ank'harel!

01:30:08.383 --> 01:30:10.531
MARISHA: (gasps) We're getting closer! Oh my god!

01:30:10.531 --> 01:30:14.407
LIAM: Is your boss with you right now? Did he come
with you or did he send you?

01:30:14.407 --> 01:30:20.358
JON: No, I'm with him, well, he said he was around
here somewhere.

01:30:20.358 --> 01:30:23.705
LIAM: Shut the &lt;i&gt;fuck&lt;/i&gt; up! He's here right now?

01:30:23.705 --> 01:30:26.003
JON: Why, is that bad or good?

01:30:26.003 --> 01:30:27.649
TRAVIS: No, real good. Real good thing.

01:30:27.649 --> 01:30:29.236
JON: It's a real good thing?

01:30:29.236 --> 01:30:30.965
LAURA: But will you bring us to him?

01:30:30.965 --> 01:30:37.436
JON: Yeah, I need your help. We need your help!
I'm kind of his messenger,

01:30:37.436 --> 01:30:39.494
I was supposed to find some--

01:30:39.494 --> 01:30:42.089
TALIESIN: This is your first time being a
messenger, is it?

01:30:42.089 --> 01:30:45.165
MATT: "I don't mean any offense, here, but I was
in the middle of a transaction,

01:30:45.165 --> 01:30:47.762
"if you don't mind, sir?!"

01:30:47.762 --> 01:30:52.749
MARISHA: We'll take the Tongues potion. How much?
Come on, give it to me.

01:30:52.749 --> 01:30:56.826
MATT: "7,000 gold pieces."

01:30:56.826 --> 01:30:59.523
MARISHA: What?! I don't have that much!

01:30:59.523 --> 01:31:04.220
ASHLEY: What was the third one, though?

01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:07.312
MATT: "The third one?"

01:31:07.312 --> 01:31:10.733
LAURA: The one you were about to say. We were
going to hear you say it before--

01:31:10.733 --> 01:31:12.428
TALIESIN: Before you were so strangely
interrupted.

01:31:12.428 --> 01:31:15.486
ASHLEY: This is very important, but...

01:31:15.486 --> 01:31:16.969
TALIESIN: You didn't have it, did you?

01:31:16.969 --> 01:31:18.330
MATT: "There's a ring."

01:31:18.330 --> 01:31:19.540
TRAVIS: A ring?

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:20.516
MATT: "A ring."

01:31:20.516 --> 01:31:21.570
TRAVIS: What does it do?

01:31:21.570 --> 01:31:23.392
MATT: "Allows you to move freely."

01:31:23.392 --> 01:31:24.906
MARISHA: Is it under a thousand gold?

01:31:24.906 --> 01:31:25.877
MATT: "No!"

01:31:25.877 --> 01:31:27.366
MARISHA: Then goodbye!

01:31:27.366 --> 01:31:28.829
LIAM: We're moving, we're moving.

01:31:28.829 --> 01:31:30.018
MATT: "Gaaah!"

01:31:30.018 --> 01:31:32.006
MARISHA: We're getting out of his store front.

01:31:32.006 --> 01:31:34.570
LAURA: Wait, Chod! Chod!

01:31:34.570 --> 01:31:35.844
TRAVIS: Chode.

01:31:35.844 --> 01:31:37.074
TALIESIN: Lionel.

01:31:37.074 --> 01:31:44.630
JON: Chod. But please call me Lionel.

01:31:44.630 --> 01:31:46.154
LIAM: Oh, you prefer Lionel!

01:31:46.154 --> 01:31:47.278
JON: Yes, of course!

01:31:47.278 --> 01:31:48.736
LAURA: Lionel's way better.

01:31:48.736 --> 01:31:51.306
JON: I probably should have told you my real name.
It's Lionel.

01:31:51.306 --> 01:31:58.214
MARISHA: Can we call you Lion for short? That's
fierce! I'm Keyleth.

01:31:58.214 --> 01:32:01.727
JON: I might get confused if you call me Lion,
though, I'm just warning you ahead of time.

01:32:01.727 --> 01:32:03.496
MARISHA: Keyleth. Nice to meet you.

01:32:03.496 --> 01:32:06.412
TALIESIN: I have a feeling you're going to get
confused even if we call you Lionel. It's Percival,

01:32:06.476 --> 01:32:08.411
it's a pleasure, Chod. Hello.

01:32:08.411 --> 01:32:09.669
JON: Hello!

01:32:09.669 --> 01:32:11.507
SAM: Taryon Darrington!

01:32:11.507 --> 01:32:12.984
JON: You're a fancy lad.

01:32:12.984 --> 01:32:15.566
LAURA: Vax. Vex.

01:32:15.566 --> 01:32:17.378
LIAM: This is going to be difficult.

01:32:17.378 --> 01:32:20.391
LAURA: Just say Vex.

01:32:20.391 --> 01:32:22.900
JON: Vex? And your name's Vex, too?

01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:30.311
LIAM: Call her little elf girl, and you can call
me little elf boy. Could we meet your boss?

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:33.418
TRAVIS: Hold on, Pike had a question.

01:32:33.418 --> 01:32:40.134
ASHLEY: Why is he your boss? What do you do? What
kind of work are you in?

01:32:40.134 --> 01:32:52.193
JON: Oh, you know, we do various things. I round
up-- He likes to make sure everybody's in line

01:32:52.193 --> 01:33:00.932
back in our area. Sometimes he makes me (sighs)
make sure people pay up, and--

01:33:00.932 --> 01:33:02.895
LAURA: So, wait a minute, so he's like a bad guy?

01:33:02.895 --> 01:33:04.041
JON: No, he's a good guy!

01:33:04.041 --> 01:33:09.117
LIAM: Are you a bouncer? Is he playing music and
you're his bouncer? Do you rough up people who try

01:33:09.117 --> 01:33:10.461
to cause trouble?

01:33:10.461 --> 01:33:13.302
JON: Well, you know, in the nicest way possible,
sometimes.

01:33:13.302 --> 01:33:15.012
LIAM: Sure, that's what I do.

01:33:15.012 --> 01:33:17.026
ASHLEY: Do you know someone named Kaylie?

01:33:17.026 --> 01:33:18.738
JON: Kaylie? No.

01:33:18.738 --> 01:33:21.391
LAURA: But do you know a girl that looks kind of
like the Meat Man?

01:33:21.391 --> 01:33:25.687
JON: I don't talk to many girls. Oh, you're a
girl! I'm sorry.

01:33:25.687 --> 01:33:27.213
Well, I'm talking to you, that's awesome!

01:33:27.213 --> 01:33:29.441
LAURA: Hey, that's great!

01:33:29.441 --> 01:33:44.994
JON: That might be a first. I forgot, so, I wasn't
supposed to call him Meat Man. In these areas,

01:33:44.994 --> 01:33:53.714
he's known as Aes Adon. I think that's what he
said.

01:33:53.714 --> 01:33:58.138
LAURA: Aes Adon? But he's actually the Meat Man.

01:33:58.138 --> 01:33:59.964
JON: Maybe.

01:33:59.964 --> 01:34:02.296
LIAM: So we get to meet the Meat Man?

01:34:02.296 --> 01:34:08.178
JON: Yeah, we need your help. But I'm just
checking you guys out first because he said I'm a

01:34:08.178 --> 01:34:09.727
real good judge of character.

01:34:09.727 --> 01:34:13.270
LAURA: And what do you think? What do you judge on
us?

01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:15.421
JON: Oh, you guys seem really nice.

01:34:15.421 --> 01:34:18.049
LAURA: You seem really great, too. You should
probably take us to him, then.

01:34:18.049 --> 01:34:22.332
JON: Yeah! It's nice to have to, you know, go do
something with people

01:34:22.332 --> 01:34:23.858
where I don't have to hurt them.

01:34:23.858 --> 01:34:27.178
LAURA: Yeah! We feel the same way sometimes.

01:34:27.178 --> 01:34:29.107
ASHLEY: So he didn't send you here to hurt us?

01:34:29.107 --> 01:34:30.121
JON: No, no.

01:34:30.121 --> 01:34:31.469
ASHLEY: Just to come.

01:34:31.469 --> 01:34:34.230
JON: Yeah, well, we need to enlist your help.

01:34:34.230 --> 01:34:45.162
MARISHA: Hang on a second. Will you earmuffs? He
knows what earmuffs are! That's good. Anyway, why

01:34:45.312 --> 01:34:52.061
would Scanlan send a messenger? He has the gate
stone! And why him?

01:34:52.061 --> 01:34:53.912
Scanlan's smarter than that, right?

01:34:53.912 --> 01:34:56.939
LAURA: Maybe Scanlan's trying to play us and he
accidentally sent someone that--

01:34:56.939 --> 01:34:58.196
MARISHA: Chode?

01:34:58.196 --> 01:34:59.350
TALIESIN: Lionel!

01:34:59.350 --> 01:35:02.948
TRAVIS: Aes Adon. I don't think it's Scanlan.

01:35:02.948 --> 01:35:04.598
LAURA: It's got to be Scanlan.

01:35:04.598 --> 01:35:08.064
MARISHA: Look, a lot of people could go by the
alter-ego Meat Man.

01:35:08.064 --> 01:35:10.594
LAURA: What other weirdo would name themselves Meat
Man?

01:35:10.632 --> 01:35:11.733
MARISHA: Good point.

01:35:11.733 --> 01:35:15.571
TALIESIN: I'm also going to put out there that we
all know we're going to go do this because we're

01:35:15.571 --> 01:35:19.603
desperate for anything to put off the inevitable
goodbyes that we were heading towards. So let's

01:35:19.754 --> 01:35:21.827
distract ourselves for a little bit.

01:35:21.827 --> 01:35:24.229
LIAM: And, fucking Scanlan!

01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:25.938
TALIESIN: We'll see.

01:35:25.938 --> 01:35:29.232
MARISHA: Look, he's still doing it! He does follow
directions well.

01:35:29.232 --> 01:35:30.254
LAURA: Lionel!

01:35:30.254 --> 01:35:31.750
TALIESIN: If I were to trick us, that's how I
would trick us.

01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:32.797
MARISHA: Lionel.

01:35:32.797 --> 01:35:39.938
JON: What? Oh, I was having such a nice story in
my head. What is it? What do you guys want?

01:35:39.938 --> 01:35:44.718
LIAM: You are very likeable. Do you have problems
talking to people? To women, even?

01:35:44.718 --> 01:35:49.457
JONL No, no, I'm really good at talking to myself
sometimes. That's where I get most practice.

01:35:49.457 --> 01:35:50.937
LIAM: It shows.

01:35:50.937 --> 01:35:52.619
TALIESIN: Quite a bit of practice.

01:35:52.619 --> 01:35:54.160
LIAM: Let's meet this chap!

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.957
JON: Yeah, let's go meet him.

01:35:55.957 --> 01:36:08.951
MATT: You watch as you're led by this lumbering
oaf of a half-orc who has a spring in his step and

01:36:08.951 --> 01:36:16.171
a perpetual smile. Everyone around just can't help
but watch him as he goes. He exudes this natural

01:36:16.171 --> 01:36:24.593
force of personality in spite of himself. People
are enthralled or spooked or just trying to figure

01:36:24.593 --> 01:36:31.265
out what the heck this individual is that's now
talking and walking with a very confused-looking

01:36:31.265 --> 01:36:38.930
Vox Machina. He leads you along to the southern
side of Whitestone, talking about his tales of

01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:48.500
growing up around Ank'harel and Marquet. Any other
tales he wishes to express along the way. But,

01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:55.834
eventually, leads you to one of the inns in the
south side of the city. The interior is empty.

01:36:55.834 --> 01:37:04.323
There is nobody in there. It is just devoid of any
people working there. You recall, because you were

01:37:04.323 --> 01:37:06.610
told to pay everybody to leave.

01:37:06.610 --> 01:37:14.139
JON: Yeah. But he was here, so, yeah. I don't
know, you guys, like,

01:37:14.139 --> 01:37:16.263
make yourselves comfortable.

01:37:16.263 --> 01:37:19.860
LIAM: This is the craziest 48 hours, I swear to
all the gods.

01:37:20.009 --> 01:37:27.086
JON: It's cool. Aes Adon has the best mutton. He
keeps it normally-- I don't think I made the

01:37:27.086 --> 01:37:29.960
mutton leave, so you can check the drawers.

01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:31.677
LAURA: I go search the drawers.

01:37:31.677 --> 01:37:33.099
SAM: In drawers?

01:37:33.099 --> 01:37:35.366
LAURA: Yeah! I start searching.

01:37:35.366 --> 01:37:37.241
SAM: I'm not going to eat any mutton from
drawers.

01:37:37.241 --> 01:37:39.189
LAURA: He gave me free rein, I'm searching this
fucking place.

01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:45.475
MATT: You start pulling through the drawers. There
is a piece of mutton in there. You get the sense

01:37:45.475 --> 01:37:50.882
that it wasn't stored there, more than maybe
it was half-eaten and left there for later.

01:37:50.882 --> 01:37:55.481
TALIESIN: 25 perception, I don't know, I'm just
looking around.

01:37:55.481 --> 01:37:57.441
LIAM: I'm looking for weirdness and traps.

01:37:57.441 --> 01:37:59.984
MATT: Okay. Make investigation checks, you guys.

01:37:59.984 --> 01:38:03.142
LIAM: 24.

01:38:03.142 --> 01:38:04.615
TALIESIN: No.

01:38:04.615 --> 01:38:06.844
LAURA: Should I be investigating, too?

01:38:06.844 --> 01:38:09.777
MATT: Sure. So, what'd you get?

01:38:09.777 --> 01:38:11.736
SAM: Ten.

01:38:11.736 --> 01:38:12.887
MARISHA: Not good.

01:38:12.887 --> 01:38:14.021
LIAM: 24.

01:38:14.021 --> 01:38:16.086
LAURA: 11.

01:38:16.086 --> 01:38:17.129
TALIESIN: 13.

01:38:17.129 --> 01:38:28.366
MATT: You find the partially eaten mutton. Vax,
you find the tavern has many drinks on tap, it has

01:38:28.366 --> 01:38:32.233
a number of cups. Looks to be remnants of people
that were possibly eating or finishing a meal that

01:38:32.233 --> 01:38:38.592
quickly left. The coffers for the tavern are
gone.

01:38:38.592 --> 01:38:41.395
LIAM: No traces of poo anywhere?

01:38:41.395 --> 01:38:43.046
MATT: No traces of poo, no.

01:38:43.046 --> 01:38:46.196
LAURA: Scanlan! Scanlan, are you here?

01:38:46.196 --> 01:38:51.033
MATT: You hear footsteps coming down a stairway on
the far end of the tavern.

01:38:51.033 --> 01:38:52.494
JON: Who's Scanlan?

01:38:52.494 --> 01:38:56.108
SAM: He's this really creepy weirdo they always
talk about.

01:38:56.108 --> 01:38:59.838
JON: No, I don't think there's a Scanlan here,
no.

01:38:59.838 --> 01:39:05.412
MATT: You watch as an imposing figure makes his
way down the stairs. As he turns around the

01:39:05.412 --> 01:39:14.173
corner, the light comes in. You see a human man,
very, very tan skin. His body is thick with

01:39:14.173 --> 01:39:20.288
muscles and is imposing by just his stance. His
shoulders are forward a little bit, his fists

01:39:20.288 --> 01:39:25.547
clenched to the side. You see a dark leather vest
that is affixed to the torso and a hood attached

01:39:25.547 --> 01:39:31.765
that hides elements of his appearance. But you do
see long stringy black hair that cascades out the

01:39:31.765 --> 01:39:40.234
front and as he turns around, you see a very
craggy, pockmarked face adorned by a thick black

01:39:40.234 --> 01:39:47.190
mustache, a deep scar that sits on his face under
one eye, and you see his one hand is rested on

01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:54.512
this curved, jeweled dagger that is sheathed on
one side. Turns around (thudding steps) walks over

01:39:54.512 --> 01:40:02.273
to one of the far tables, pulls the chair out,
spins it around, sits in it and rests on it.

01:40:02.273 --> 01:40:09.160
"Welcome, friends. You are Vox Machina, yes?"

01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:13.149
LIAM: Who's asking?

01:40:13.149 --> 01:40:19.802
MATT: "Sit down, please. If you don't mind. You
are guests of mine right now."

01:40:19.802 --> 01:40:22.184
SAM: Is this Scanlan?

01:40:22.184 --> 01:40:23.465
TALIESIN: No.

01:40:23.465 --> 01:40:27.914
LAURA: I want to roll a perception, I want to see
if it's an illusion, if it actually is Scanlan.

01:40:27.914 --> 01:40:29.790
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:32.884
JON: I told you, I don't--

01:40:32.884 --> 01:40:36.742
MATT: "Chod! Good job." And he flicks you a gold
coin.

01:40:36.742 --> 01:40:37.946
LAURA: 25.

01:40:37.946 --> 01:40:39.369
MATT: 25.

01:40:39.369 --> 01:40:43.297
TRAVIS: What? Oh god! Jesus! Balls!

01:40:43.297 --> 01:40:44.330
SAM: Whispers!

01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:45.493
LIAM: Incoming whisper!

01:40:45.493 --> 01:40:51.032
SAM: The Scanlan Shorthalt t-shirts are available
on the store right now. Travis is wearing one. You

01:40:51.032 --> 01:40:57.120
can see it maybe on your screen. He's doing a
little jig! Boop boop do boop boop! Boop boop! Buy

01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:58.497
your shirts today.

01:40:58.497 --> 01:41:00.306
LIAM: The hottest penguin I ever saw.

01:41:00.477 --> 01:41:09.978
MATT: "My name is Aes Adon."

01:41:09.978 --> 01:41:11.676
JON: Told you.

01:41:11.676 --> 01:41:18.529
MATT: "I'm but a humble merchant from Ank'harel,
and I'm seeking to make some contacts in this

01:41:18.529 --> 01:41:23.896
"rumored emerging metropolis of Whitestone. Yes?"

01:41:23.896 --> 01:41:25.747
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:41:25.747 --> 01:41:36.397
MATT: "Now, I have information that may be of use to
you, my compatriots have told me. And, should my

01:41:36.397 --> 01:41:45.698
"gatherers and whisperers be correct, in trade I
would like to get some information from this one."

01:41:45.698 --> 01:41:50.421
TALIESIN: Possibly. What is it that you want to
know?

01:41:50.421 --> 01:41:56.005
MATT: "Rumors tell me of these fabled Riflemen of
Whitestone."

01:41:56.005 --> 01:41:57.801
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:41:57.801 --> 01:42:08.633
MATT: "While paltry mechanical imitations have
occasionally come across the markets on our side

01:42:08.633 --> 01:42:16.881
"of the world, I hear that you were the designer of
these instruments of death."

01:42:16.881 --> 01:42:18.025
MARISHA: Oh no.

01:42:18.025 --> 01:42:19.425
TALIESIN: I am.

01:42:19.425 --> 01:42:26.201
MATT: "Well, in the intent of expanding my
influence in keeping the peace where I do

01:42:26.201 --> 01:42:37.134
"business, I would like to make a trade. This
important information for you to grant me access

01:42:37.134 --> 01:42:39.139
"to your designs."

01:42:39.139 --> 01:42:47.107
TALIESIN: What is this information? You don't even
need to tell me what it is, but that would be

01:42:47.107 --> 01:42:50.993
worth quite a lot, and what you knew would have to
be worth quite a lot.

01:42:50.993 --> 01:42:52.983
MARISHA: Selling the secret recipe, man.

01:42:52.983 --> 01:43:11.462
MATT: "Let's say that information has come to my
attention regarding a hidden location on Marquet.

01:43:11.462 --> 01:43:14.765
"A compatriot of mine, whom you've already met--"

01:43:14.765 --> 01:43:17.707
JON: (heavy, repeated sniffing)

01:43:17.707 --> 01:43:28.527
MATT: "-- recently returned from an expedition I
sent him on, where he stumbled upon a pyramid."

01:43:28.527 --> 01:43:30.549
TRAVIS: A pyramid?

01:43:30.549 --> 01:43:34.429
MATT: "Yes. Does this pique your interest?"

01:43:34.429 --> 01:43:35.952
MARISHA: Oh no.

01:43:35.952 --> 01:43:39.179
LIAM: Ziggurat.

01:43:39.179 --> 01:43:44.865
MATT: "So, this is the information I have to
offer."

01:43:44.865 --> 01:43:46.752
MARISHA: Wait, he said Marquet, though.

01:43:46.752 --> 01:43:47.894
LAURA: Yeah.

01:43:47.894 --> 01:43:49.565
LIAM: Another one.

01:43:49.565 --> 01:43:51.353
LAURA: Did you go inside of it?

01:43:51.353 --> 01:43:54.897
JON: No. No.

01:43:54.897 --> 01:43:56.523
LAURA: Did you see anybody around?

01:43:56.523 --> 01:43:57.948
SAM: Did you see anything about it?

01:43:57.948 --> 01:43:59.008
JON: Yeah!

01:43:59.008 --> 01:44:04.697
MATT: "I would request you hold that information
until we make a deal."

01:44:04.697 --> 01:44:06.254
JON: Sorry, Aes. Sorry, Aes.

01:44:06.254 --> 01:44:08.454
SAM: No, no, you can go ahead and tell us!

01:44:08.454 --> 01:44:10.537
JON: No, he's my boss.

01:44:10.537 --> 01:44:12.856
LAURA: Does it count if it's a girl that he's
talking to?

01:44:12.856 --> 01:44:14.906
I mean, it's not quite the same, right?

01:44:14.906 --> 01:44:19.704
MATT: "Silence! My deal is with you, Vox
Machina."

01:44:19.704 --> 01:44:23.263
LIAM: You can tell us later.

01:44:23.299 --> 01:44:25.092
TALIESIN: What is this worth?

01:44:25.092 --> 01:44:27.182
JON: You should listen to him.

01:44:27.182 --> 01:44:35.265
MARISHA: I guess it depends on what he thinks it's
worth to us. What makes you think that we want

01:44:35.265 --> 01:44:37.312
this information so much?

01:44:37.312 --> 01:44:46.595
MATT: "I've had a compatriot of yours stumble
through my city seeking information about,

01:44:46.595 --> 01:44:57.236
"apparently, something beneath your city. The
whispers come to me. I saw a connection. From what

01:44:57.236 --> 01:45:04.189
"I hear, you've put quite a bit of energy into this
darkened orb."

01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:16.489
TALIESIN: Well, this leaves me with a bit of a
conundrum. Traditionally, when people come either

01:45:16.489 --> 01:45:22.977
asking to see my designs or if we come across
people who have been attempting to replicate them,

01:45:22.977 --> 01:45:27.874
we just simply have them executed on sight.
Traditionally.

01:45:27.874 --> 01:45:30.691
MATT: "I would not recommend that."

01:45:30.691 --> 01:45:33.963
TALIESIN: Well, if I were going to do it, it would
have already been done, now wouldn't it?

01:45:34.018 --> 01:45:39.585
JON: Well, I don't know about that. Remember.
Enchantment.

01:45:39.585 --> 01:45:44.257
MATT: "Thank you, Chod."

01:45:44.257 --> 01:45:46.176
SAM: I think that was a threat.

01:45:46.176 --> 01:45:49.440
TALIESIN: That was a very good threat!

01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:51.666
JON: Really? Was it?

01:45:51.666 --> 01:45:55.672
TALIESIN: It was definitely a strong six.

01:45:55.672 --> 01:46:00.368
LIAM: How'd you hear about this compatriot? How do
we know you're not selling us a song? Who was this

01:46:00.368 --> 01:46:01.634
compatriot of ours?

01:46:01.634 --> 01:46:03.952
LAURA: What?

01:46:03.952 --> 01:46:06.830
LIAM: He said someone came through? He's talking
about this guy?

01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:07.997
MATT: No.

01:46:07.997 --> 01:46:10.394
JON: My name's Lionel, you guys.

01:46:10.394 --> 01:46:14.769
MATT: "I did not meet this individual, but
apparently they belong

01:46:14.769 --> 01:46:17.105
"on the council of your country."

01:46:17.105 --> 01:46:18.303
MARISHA: What?

01:46:18.303 --> 01:46:20.380
LIAM: Little bit more, please.

01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:23.717
MATT: "Blonde of hair. Traverses through arcane
means."

01:46:23.717 --> 01:46:26.358
MARISHA: What? What'd he say?

01:46:26.358 --> 01:46:27.955
LIAM: Man or woman?

01:46:27.955 --> 01:46:31.890
MATT: "Woman. Blonde of hair."

01:46:31.890 --> 01:46:33.260
MARISHA: Allura.

01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:34.330
TALIESIN: Well.

01:46:34.330 --> 01:46:37.066
MARISHA: What is happening?

01:46:37.066 --> 01:46:39.979
TRAVIS: She went to go find information about it,
that's not strange.

01:46:39.979 --> 01:46:41.283
MARISHA: That's not bad, right?

01:46:41.283 --> 01:46:48.005
ASHLEY: What does the Meat Man mean to you?

01:46:48.005 --> 01:46:55.596
MATT: Leans back and you see he takes the dagger
out and spins it a little bit on the fingertip.

01:46:55.596 --> 01:47:08.141
"The Meat Man is before you. I don't know where
you heard this title, but--"

01:47:08.141 --> 01:47:18.602
(laughter)

01:47:18.644 --> 01:47:21.511
JON: I told you guys, it's Aes!

01:47:21.574 --> 01:47:24.340
MATT: "There will be a conversation later."

01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:25.923
LAURA: Oh no!

01:47:25.923 --> 01:47:33.732
MATT: "But that is a business alias of mine that
I've had for a short time."

01:47:33.732 --> 01:47:36.050
ASHLEY: You don't need to get upset with him for
it.

01:47:36.050 --> 01:47:41.803
MARISHA: We had a friend who we thought it
might've been him.

01:47:41.803 --> 01:47:43.498
TRAVIS: Keyleth, stay on task!

01:47:43.498 --> 01:47:44.907
MARISHA: Sorry.

01:47:44.907 --> 01:47:46.778
MATT: "There is no other Meat Man."

01:47:46.778 --> 01:47:51.725
LIAM: It's kind of a sticking point for us. You're
coming to us with one piece of information that we

01:47:51.725 --> 01:47:56.257
may be interested in, but you're accidentally
tipping your hand towards something else that we

01:47:56.257 --> 01:48:05.748
want to know about. We know a Meat Man, and he is
not you.

01:48:05.748 --> 01:48:10.435
ASHLEY: Do you know... the Meat Man?

01:48:10.435 --> 01:48:12.674
LIAM: Do you know the muffin man?

01:48:12.674 --> 01:48:15.976
TALIESIN: This meeting is only happening because
we were hoping to meet our Meat Man.

01:48:15.976 --> 01:48:23.782
MATT: "If you are referring to the small one, he's
been dealt with. The title is now mine."

01:48:23.782 --> 01:48:25.320
TALIESIN: Dealt with.

01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:29.893
LIAM: Roll back a step or two. Dealt with how?

01:48:29.893 --> 01:48:37.755
MATT: "Dealt with in the way that anyone who does
sloppy business: imprisoned. No longer of

01:48:37.755 --> 01:48:40.477
"consequence. I was next in line."

01:48:40.477 --> 01:48:47.607
MARISHA: I'm sorry, you think that the title of
Meat Man is so important that you had to kill or

01:48:47.607 --> 01:48:51.038
attack a gnome who also went by Meat Man?

01:48:51.038 --> 01:49:00.503
MATT: "The Meat Man I take the title from was not
killed by me. He was a great man. Small, but

01:49:00.503 --> 01:49:13.415
"resolute. Confident. Handsome as they come. He
taught me everything I know. It is a shame that he

01:49:13.415 --> 01:49:17.667
"has been lost in chains beneath the city, but I am
keeping up."

01:49:17.667 --> 01:49:21.386
LAURA: &lt;i&gt;Such&lt;/i&gt; a shame that's he's been lost.

01:49:21.386 --> 01:49:24.928
MARISHA: So, you've taken on the title yourself.

01:49:24.928 --> 01:49:27.164
MATT: "I have, in his memory."

01:49:27.164 --> 01:49:30.055
MARISHA: And what city is he in chains beneath?

01:49:30.055 --> 01:49:32.402
MATT: "Beneath Ank'harel in its deepest prisons."

01:49:32.402 --> 01:49:34.628
ASHLEY: Did he tell you to take on his name?

01:49:34.628 --> 01:49:41.810
MATT: "No, it was bequeathed by the others left
behind in his absence. They respect me, and as

01:49:41.810 --> 01:49:45.520
"such, the Meat Man is I."

01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:47.923
LIAM: The name was simply meat-ed out.

01:49:47.923 --> 01:49:50.264
MARISHA: He's totally Dread Pirates Roberts-ing
this shit.

01:49:50.264 --> 01:49:53.830
TALIESIN: The designs of the guns are out of the
question.

01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:56.796
That doesn't mean there aren't things on the table.

01:49:56.796 --> 01:50:00.803
MATT: "If not the designs, perhaps a few rifles
and some ammunition.

01:50:00.803 --> 01:50:04.737
"Something I can take back to my workers."

01:50:04.737 --> 01:50:11.688
MARISHA: Here's a question: Why did Allura come to
you for information?

01:50:11.688 --> 01:50:14.572
MATT: "Oh, she didn't come to me, but whispers
came to me

01:50:14.572 --> 01:50:16.633
"that she was seeking this information."

01:50:16.633 --> 01:50:21.717
MARISHA: Right. So you have ears in all the right
places.

01:50:21.717 --> 01:50:23.374
MATT: "Everywhere, my dear."

01:50:23.374 --> 01:50:29.982
SAM: You said workers? Are you a foreman of some
sort?

01:50:29.982 --> 01:50:39.663
MATT: "You could say that. I run a business in
various goods. Some legal, and I make sure that

01:50:39.663 --> 01:50:43.258
"clients get them in a very forthright manner."

01:50:43.258 --> 01:50:49.158
TALIESIN: We're sadly very protective of our
copyrights, and my designs are not for

01:50:49.158 --> 01:50:59.095
reproduction. Attempts at reproducing them tend to
end poorly. Many have tried; most have failed. If

01:50:59.095 --> 01:51:07.879
you wanted, perhaps, a few designed, that could
have been a conversation, but so far, I'm not

01:51:07.879 --> 01:51:09.526
impressed by you.

01:51:09.526 --> 01:51:14.786
MATT: "Well then, we have nothing more to discuss,
then. Come, Chod."

01:51:14.786 --> 01:51:16.804
JON: Okay, see you guys later!

01:51:16.804 --> 01:51:25.360
LIAM: Before you leave-- prison. What was this
other Meat Man's offense? Do you know?

01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:26.461
JON: I don't know.

01:51:26.461 --> 01:51:27.586
LIAM: You don't know anything.

01:51:27.586 --> 01:51:29.507
JON: No, I don't know a lot of stuff. He doesn't
tell me.

01:51:29.507 --> 01:51:30.776
LIAM: Do you like working for that guy?

01:51:30.776 --> 01:51:33.249
JON: Yeah, he's great, he gives me money and food
and mutton.

01:51:33.249 --> 01:51:35.402
MARISHA: What if we gave you money and food and
mutton?

01:51:35.402 --> 01:51:36.794
LIAM: We have mutton.

01:51:36.794 --> 01:51:38.250
MARISHA: How much money does he give you?

01:51:38.250 --> 01:51:44.242
JON: I like working for him. He keeps me safe.

01:51:44.242 --> 01:51:46.052
SAM: What about this guy?

01:51:46.052 --> 01:51:48.962
LIAM: What about this guy? For Wildmount! Your
brigade!

01:51:48.962 --> 01:51:50.030
SAM: I mean...

01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:51.574
LIAM: I mean, you got to start somewhere!

01:51:51.574 --> 01:51:53.017
MARISHA: You could recruit him!

01:51:53.017 --> 01:51:54.443
SAM: Wow. I mean--

01:51:54.443 --> 01:51:56.835
LIAM: You were rough around the edges when we met
you!

01:51:56.835 --> 01:51:59.047
JON: I feel like I should do earmuffs right now
again.

01:51:59.047 --> 01:52:04.086
SAM: Yeah, I'm pretty sure I can do better than
this guy. I mean, he's really imposing and strong.

01:52:04.086 --> 01:52:11.747
Also, guys, not to split hairs here, but his boss
is literally right there, listening to us. So

01:52:11.747 --> 01:52:14.419
maybe we shouldn't be talking about recruiting his
employee.

01:52:14.419 --> 01:52:17.161
MATT: "Your shiny friend has a point."

01:52:17.161 --> 01:52:22.617
TALIESIN: I'm quite surprised by the brazenness.
What on earth made you think that we would sell

01:52:22.617 --> 01:52:27.770
these designs to you? You obviously are paying
attention.

01:52:27.770 --> 01:52:32.950
MATT: "As you hopefully know, the intent of
negotiation is to aim high."

01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:34.603
TALIESIN: That's fair.

01:52:34.603 --> 01:52:41.663
MATT: "Then bring your expectations. So perhaps
not plans. But a few rifles, a pistol or two and

01:52:41.663 --> 01:52:44.143
"some ammunition would be enough to outfit my
team."

01:52:44.143 --> 01:52:46.106
LAURA: A whole team. With one pistol.

01:52:46.106 --> 01:52:53.828
TALIESIN: One pistol can do a quite a bit. One
pistol can go far.

01:52:53.828 --> 01:52:58.140
MARISHA: The problem is that once he has the
designs, he can replicate them.

01:52:58.140 --> 01:52:59.502
LIAM: Reverse engineer.

01:52:59.502 --> 01:53:02.473
LAURA: I don't think he would be able to reverse
engineer it.

01:53:02.473 --> 01:53:05.743
MATT: "But I have my artisans at my disposal."

01:53:05.743 --> 01:53:11.024
ASHLEY: Wait, why did you think we would want this
information?

01:53:11.024 --> 01:53:19.423
MATT: "Well, if you don't, I'm happy to leave.
Make some business here, some gold and then be on

01:53:19.423 --> 01:53:30.356
"my way. But I was informed that you, Vox Machina,
so widely respected, so strong, so rich, so

01:53:30.356 --> 01:53:38.044
"involved in yourselves and your worldwide
endeavors, that perhaps a little more world-saving

01:53:38.044 --> 01:53:42.555
"might be up your alley, but maybe I thought you
wrong."

01:53:42.555 --> 01:53:45.851
TALIESIN: How's giving you one of my weapons
world-saving?

01:53:45.851 --> 01:53:49.781
MATT: "Because the information I give you in
return may help save the world."

01:53:49.781 --> 01:53:55.235
LIAM: You sound like you know about the stakes
involved.

01:53:55.235 --> 01:53:57.436
MATT: "Just what I've been whispered."

01:53:57.436 --> 01:54:03.052
MARISHA: We've met a lot of doom-seers. You sure
you can stand up to them?

01:54:03.052 --> 01:54:11.478
MATT: "I grow tired of this conversation. If this
is a declination?"

01:54:11.478 --> 01:54:15.060
TALIESIN: At the very least, this is a
conversation of whether or not you're ever going

01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:19.032
to do business in this city again and what that
business is going to look like.

01:54:19.032 --> 01:54:27.410
MATT: "Do not worry. You'll not see this face in
your precious Whitestone again." He stands up.

01:54:27.410 --> 01:54:33.091
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check to see if I can
glean any more of what he knows about this

01:54:33.091 --> 01:54:34.509
world-ending thing?

01:54:34.509 --> 01:54:37.418
MATT: Okay. Insight check.

01:54:37.418 --> 01:54:39.623
MARISHA: Natural 20.

01:54:39.623 --> 01:54:41.994
SAM: Whisper!

01:54:41.994 --> 01:54:43.588
TALIESIN: Earmuffs! Earmuffs!

01:54:43.588 --> 01:54:45.590
LAURA: Everybody earmuffs!

01:54:45.590 --> 01:54:52.350
LIAM: I mean, Tary, Grog is about as smart as a
golden retriever and he does great.

01:54:52.350 --> 01:55:02.330
SAM: I know! But this guy seems like he would lose
a spelling bee to Grog. He's really dumb!

01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:06.801
LAURA: Well, up until a few weeks ago, Grog
couldn't really spell, either.

01:55:06.801 --> 01:55:08.292
ASHLEY: We could hold a spelling bee!

01:55:08.292 --> 01:55:09.472
SAM: That's true.

01:55:09.472 --> 01:55:12.010
MARISHA: Is he still walking away?

01:55:12.010 --> 01:55:16.323
MATT: He's going over to the half-orc. He goes,
"Come on, we're leaving."

01:55:16.323 --> 01:55:22.424
MARISHA: I look at Vex and Vax and them and I say,
we know him.

01:55:22.424 --> 01:55:23.943
LAURA: Give it a moment.

01:55:23.943 --> 01:55:25.481
MARISHA: There's something familiar about him.

01:55:25.481 --> 01:55:27.054
LAURA: I go and I follow him.

01:55:27.054 --> 01:55:28.205
MATT: Okay, he walks out.

01:55:28.205 --> 01:55:29.816
MARISHA: He knows more than he's letting on.

01:55:29.816 --> 01:55:30.971
MATT: "Come!"

01:55:30.971 --> 01:55:38.523
JON: All right, I'm coming. You guys should really
reconsider, that's a word he just told me. I mean,

01:55:38.523 --> 01:55:47.584
he sounds scary and all, but it's really awesome
stuff he has to share if you guys just shared

01:55:47.584 --> 01:55:51.029
back. Okay. See you.

01:55:51.077 --> 01:55:53.464
LAURA: I follow him right out of the room.

01:55:53.464 --> 01:55:57.513
MATT: Both of them walk out into the daylight and
you follow.

01:55:57.569 --> 01:55:58.759
LAURA: Aes.

01:55:58.759 --> 01:56:03.932
MATT: He turns around. "Yes?"

01:56:03.932 --> 01:56:06.132
LAURA: I run up and I hug him.

01:56:06.132 --> 01:56:09.140
MATT: Okay! Full-body?

01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:13.834
LAURA: Just a big hug! And I go down.

01:56:13.834 --> 01:56:19.275
MATT: Okay. Immediately, instinctively, he backs
up and you watch as Vex's arms pass through the

01:56:19.275 --> 01:56:23.593
legs and thighs and grab onto something smaller on
the inside.

01:56:23.593 --> 01:56:24.671
MARISHA: Motherfucker!

01:56:24.671 --> 01:56:29.798
SAM: (as Scanlan) Stop! Stop stop stop stop stop!
Not here! Not here! Let's go somewhere else. Now.

01:56:29.798 --> 01:56:31.141
Let's go.

01:56:31.141 --> 01:56:34.371
TALIESIN: What?! What?! No!

01:56:34.371 --> 01:56:38.511
MARISHA: Motherfucker! Motherfucker!

01:56:38.511 --> 01:56:40.282
MATT: And let's go ahead and take a break!

01:56:40.282 --> 01:56:42.353
(screaming)

01:56:42.353 --> 01:56:45.329
TRAVIS: I'll kill you! I'm going to kill you!

01:56:45.329 --> 01:56:47.824
MARISHA: Motherfucker!

01:56:47.824 --> 01:56:51.478
TRAVIS: How could you?

01:56:51.478 --> 01:56:53.712
MARISHA: Natural 20!

01:56:53.712 --> 01:56:55.450
TALIESIN: Oh, well done, you.

01:56:55.450 --> 01:56:58.623
MATT: We're going to take a quick break, be right
back here in a minute to pick this up. We're going

01:56:58.623 --> 01:57:04.800
to go ahead and have a Twitch giveaway in the
chatroom for this awesome Wyrmwood complete

01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:11.917
system. This includes a dice tray, a dice box, a
couple of fun things. It's zebrawood, which is

01:57:11.917 --> 01:57:18.908
nice. But, to win this, you have to go into the
Twitch chat. The code for this is 'bardbarian."

01:57:18.908 --> 01:57:25.857
B-A-R-D-B-A-R-I-A-N. Barbarian, but with
bard-barian. Cool. So, we'll see you guys back

01:57:25.857 --> 01:57:27.398
here in a few minutes.

01:57:27.398 --> 01:57:29.672
TRAVIS: You! Son of a &lt;i&gt;bitch!&lt;/i&gt;

01:57:29.672 --> 01:57:30.861
LAURA: Oh my god!

01:57:30.861 --> 02:11:39.419
[break]

02:11:39.419 --> 02:11:42.339
MATT: Hello, guys! And welcome back to tonight's
episode of Critical Role!

02:11:42.339 --> 02:11:44.148
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch!

02:11:44.148 --> 02:11:55.769
MATT: (laughs) So picking up where we left off,
Lionel, you just watched as this half-elf girl

02:11:55.769 --> 02:12:04.017
forcefully merged with part of your boss, and your
boss starts freaking out as everyone else, you all

02:12:04.017 --> 02:12:08.535
spook in mid-daylight as you hear this familiar
voice come through, saying...

02:12:08.535 --> 02:12:10.661
What did you say, again?

02:12:10.661 --> 02:12:13.162
SAM: They were all there? I thought she just
followed me.

02:12:13.162 --> 02:12:14.311
TALIESIN: We were not there.

02:12:14.311 --> 02:12:16.672
MATT: Oh, it was just you. You guys were still
inside the tavern.

02:12:16.672 --> 02:12:17.969
SAM: Is Lionel there, though?

02:12:17.969 --> 02:12:19.188
MATT: He left with you.

02:12:19.188 --> 02:12:22.406
JON: (gasps)

02:12:22.406 --> 02:12:27.622
SAM: Lionel. Please. Go back inside.

02:12:27.622 --> 02:12:29.416
JON: What did you do? What did you do?

02:12:29.416 --> 02:12:30.924
SAM: Go back inside the tavern.

02:12:30.924 --> 02:12:32.385
JON: Where's Aes? Where's Aes?

02:12:32.385 --> 02:12:35.883
SAM: I am still he. Please, go back inside the
tavern.

02:12:35.883 --> 02:12:38.144
JON: Okay.

02:12:38.144 --> 02:12:39.893
SAM: Wait for me there.

02:12:39.893 --> 02:12:42.545
JON: They were nice people anyway. All right.

02:12:42.545 --> 02:12:53.228
MATT: So, Vex, you're now there, staring at the
Danny Trejo-like visage of the Meat Man.

02:12:53.228 --> 02:13:01.095
SAM: I'll grab her by the hand and pull her
into... Is there a back alley or a side place or a

02:13:01.095 --> 02:13:02.488
shadow anywhere?

02:13:02.488 --> 02:13:07.180
MATT: There's, maybe about 15 feet off, a little
alley you could duck into, yeah.

02:13:07.180 --> 02:13:09.392
SAM: Come with me.

02:13:09.392 --> 02:13:10.965
LAURA: Of course.

02:13:10.965 --> 02:13:17.970
SAM: When we're safely off the street, I take off
the Hat of Disguise and reveal myself.

02:13:17.970 --> 02:13:20.918
LAURA: Scanlan!

02:13:20.918 --> 02:13:22.186
SAM: Hi.

02:13:22.186 --> 02:13:26.645
LAURA: What are you doing? I mean, I knew it was
you, but I thought you were going to reveal

02:13:26.645 --> 02:13:28.333
yourself to everyone.

02:13:28.333 --> 02:13:34.382
MATT: What you do notice about Scanlan...
Definitely tanner skin; that scar you saw under

02:13:34.382 --> 02:13:40.453
the eye, still there on Scanlan, and the clothing
and the outfit design is much more Marquesian than

02:13:40.453 --> 02:13:44.516
you recall. Definitely more Gilmore than Scanlan.

02:13:44.516 --> 02:13:46.399
LAURA: Have you been there the whole time?

02:13:46.399 --> 02:13:53.644
SAM: Not the whole time, but for much of it. I
didn't know if I could talk to you all.

02:13:53.644 --> 02:13:56.879
LAURA: I hold his hand and just listen.

02:13:56.879 --> 02:14:04.235
SAM: There's a lot to talk about, but not here. I
have appearances to keep up, I have people

02:14:04.235 --> 02:14:06.229
depending on me who work for me.

02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:08.577
LAURA: Are you really the Meat Man there?

02:14:08.577 --> 02:14:11.675
SAM: I am many things.

02:14:11.675 --> 02:14:12.761
LAURA: Darling.

02:14:12.761 --> 02:14:13.911
SAM: Well, I am.

02:14:13.911 --> 02:14:15.643
LAURA: Okay.

02:14:15.643 --> 02:14:27.375
SAM: Yes, I am, but it's not what you would think.
I'm not a bad guy. This is not the place to talk

02:14:27.375 --> 02:14:32.769
about this. Listen to me. Vex, there will be a
time to discuss this, but right now,

02:14:32.769 --> 02:14:34.932
I'm casting Modify Memory on you.

02:14:34.932 --> 02:14:35.855
LAURA: Don't you do it.

02:14:35.855 --> 02:14:36.768
SAM: Yes.

02:14:36.768 --> 02:14:39.420
LAURA: Don't you do it! I push him against the
wall. Can I break it?

02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:41.039
Can I break it before he does it?

02:14:41.039 --> 02:14:46.375
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw. Actually, no,
for this I'm going to have to ask you guys both to

02:14:46.375 --> 02:14:49.114
roll initiative. That's what this is going to come
down to.

02:14:49.114 --> 02:14:50.918
MARISHA: Come on, Vex!

02:14:50.918 --> 02:14:52.647
SAM: That's not good.

02:14:52.647 --> 02:14:53.763
TALIESIN: Yes!

02:14:53.763 --> 02:14:55.653
LIAM: We got an actual dice roll in the game!

02:14:55.653 --> 02:14:56.737
LAURA: 24.

02:14:56.737 --> 02:14:57.974
SAM: Six.

02:14:57.974 --> 02:15:07.038
MATT: Okay. So he begins, after saying this,
casting the spell. What do you do?

02:15:07.038 --> 02:15:09.394
LAURA: No! I grab his hands and cover his mouth!

02:15:09.394 --> 02:15:13.530
MATT: Okay. I'll say go ahead and make a
concentration check, so make a constitution saving

02:15:13.530 --> 02:15:24.706
throw. I'm going to have you... Let's see, for
this... Just roll a d20.

02:15:24.706 --> 02:15:28.032
SAM: Constitution saving throw?

02:15:28.032 --> 02:15:29.034
MATT: Yes.

02:15:29.034 --> 02:15:31.618
LAURA: Do I add to it?

02:15:31.618 --> 02:15:33.215
MATT: Roll a d20 and add your dex modifier to it.

02:15:33.215 --> 02:15:34.603
LAURA: Dex modifier or dex saving throw?

02:15:34.603 --> 02:15:37.206
MATT: Dex modifier.

02:15:37.206 --> 02:15:39.299
TALIESIN: No! No!

02:15:39.299 --> 02:15:41.298
MARISHA: No!

02:15:41.298 --> 02:15:45.053
TRAVIS: Oh, two ones! Two ones!

02:15:45.053 --> 02:15:48.472
LIAM: Everybody speechless.

02:15:48.472 --> 02:16:00.612
MATT: So as you go to push him into the wall, you
accidentally hit between where his foot and the

02:16:00.612 --> 02:16:04.526
edge of the stone is and it causes you to stumble
forward and slam into him. You fall over. You, in

02:16:04.526 --> 02:16:07.044
the process, she hits you in the side of the...

02:16:07.044 --> 02:16:09.549
SAM: Do we accidentally kiss? Is that what's going
to happen here?

02:16:09.549 --> 02:16:13.310
MATT: Almost, but instead, you both accidentally
end up elbowing the shit out of each other. She

02:16:13.310 --> 02:16:19.281
falls over, you tumble over her and become this
tangled pile of soreness. The spell is lost.

02:16:19.281 --> 02:16:20.450
SAM: Damn it!

02:16:20.450 --> 02:16:28.080
MATT: However, you guys in the tavern, hear a
(flurry of blows) against the wall on the outside.

02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:30.502
LIAM: I was starting to follow. I push the door
open...

02:16:30.502 --> 02:16:32.351
SAM: You can't tell them! You can't tell them!

02:16:32.351 --> 02:16:34.519
LIAM: Holy shit!

02:16:34.519 --> 02:16:36.427
TALIESIN: I hear that and I start walking out.

02:16:36.427 --> 02:16:37.628
LIAM: Holy shit!

02:16:37.628 --> 02:16:39.695
LAURA: Shut up, shut up, shut up! Shush!

02:16:39.695 --> 02:16:42.794
MARISHA: I bust through right behind Vax.

02:16:42.794 --> 02:16:44.229
MATT: You guys all rush around to the alley.

02:16:44.279 --> 02:16:45.310
MARISHA: You dick!

02:16:45.369 --> 02:16:46.992
TALIESIN: Now I run.

02:16:47.068 --> 02:16:50.192
MARISHA: I knew you were familiar!

02:16:50.192 --> 02:16:55.310
LAURA: Everyone, shut up! Shut up, shut up. If you
need to do something, change back, do it.

02:16:55.310 --> 02:16:57.748
SAM: How long does the hat take?

02:16:57.748 --> 02:16:59.789
MATT: It takes an action to do the spell.

02:16:59.789 --> 02:17:02.403
SAM: Okay. Hat on. (whoosh)

02:17:02.403 --> 02:17:04.238
LAURA: Appearances are important.

02:17:04.238 --> 02:17:06.562
ASHLEY: I make my way through. What's going on?

02:17:06.562 --> 02:17:12.835
MARISHA: No one talks about Scanlan being handsome
as much as Scanlan does. That was your first

02:17:12.835 --> 02:17:14.278
giveaway, mister!

02:17:14.278 --> 02:17:16.429
LIAM: We're in an alley, though, off to the
side, right?

02:17:16.429 --> 02:17:18.011
MATT: Yeah, you're in a dark alley.

02:17:18.011 --> 02:17:20.062
LIAM: Well, then I'm giving him a big fucking
hug!

02:17:20.062 --> 02:17:22.334
SAM: It's hard to do, but yes.

02:17:22.334 --> 02:17:28.053
MATT: So, Lionel, everyone just charges out of the
tavern, and you hear a big commotion

02:17:28.053 --> 02:17:29.893
and voices on the side.

02:17:29.893 --> 02:17:37.475
JON: What's going on, you guys? What's happening?
Can I... I think they're attacking him.

02:17:37.475 --> 02:17:41.072
MATT: At this point, you watch as the other one is
now grabbing him, merging.

02:17:41.072 --> 02:17:45.428
JON: Yeah, it looks like they're attacking. So I
want to protect him.

02:17:45.428 --> 02:17:47.102
SAM: As he should.

02:17:47.102 --> 02:17:50.033
MATT: What are you going to do to protect him?

02:17:50.033 --> 02:17:51.566
TALIESIN: You can go ahead and just say.

02:17:51.566 --> 02:17:54.431
MATT: Are you going to scare them off, are you
going to attack them?

02:17:54.431 --> 02:17:55.832
SAM: Kill them?

02:17:55.832 --> 02:18:02.273
JON: Yeah. No! I want to scare them away, and...

02:18:02.273 --> 02:18:05.265
MATT: Do you have an ability that does that?

02:18:05.265 --> 02:18:09.661
TALIESIN: Or you can try and intimidate us, and
say something really scary, or make some noise.

02:18:09.661 --> 02:18:13.325
JON: No, I want to do the Frantic Flail.

02:18:13.325 --> 02:18:19.282
MATT: Okay, all right. So as you're hugging him,
you guys watch as the half-orc turns the corner,

02:18:19.282 --> 02:18:26.674
spooks, and then, suddenly, you watch as something
beneath the armor glows briefly, and he starts

02:18:26.674 --> 02:18:33.505
flapping his arms, going (honking) right at you. I
need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

02:18:33.505 --> 02:18:35.152
TRAVIS: What?

02:18:35.152 --> 02:18:37.240
JON: It'll be explained later.

02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:41.197
LIAM: It's not... Does it have anything to do with
charm, or sleep, by any chance?

02:18:41.197 --> 02:18:42.385
MATT: Nope.

02:18:42.385 --> 02:18:46.437
LIAM: No. Okay. All right. Oh, that's fine. 20.

02:18:46.437 --> 02:18:47.702
JON: Damn.

02:18:47.702 --> 02:18:52.997
MATT: Okay, so it doesn't spook you off, it's just
a little weird, as this giant man is now honking

02:18:52.997 --> 02:18:57.204
and waving and flapping his arms at you. He
doesn't seem to be affected by it, he just gives

02:18:57.204 --> 02:18:58.570
you a strange look.

02:18:58.570 --> 02:18:59.815
JON: Yeah.

02:18:59.815 --> 02:19:04.021
SAM: It's okay, stand down, Lionel. I can defend
myself.

02:19:04.021 --> 02:19:08.161
JON: Because you know I'm good for... That
normally works on everybody else.

02:19:08.161 --> 02:19:14.144
SAM: You are my best man, and I appreciate your
concern, but these people pose no threat to us.

02:19:14.144 --> 02:19:15.922
LIAM: That is a really good accent.

02:19:15.922 --> 02:19:17.228
MARISHA: Yeah, you're so good at that.

02:19:17.228 --> 02:19:19.028
JON: What are they talking about, accent?

02:19:19.028 --> 02:19:25.957
SAM: They are beguiled by our foreign ways and
they are scared of what they do not understand.

02:19:25.957 --> 02:19:27.457
LIAM: True.

02:19:27.457 --> 02:19:33.948
TALIESIN: That's true. I'm going to start walking
back to the inn, and I'm going to start pouring a

02:19:33.948 --> 02:19:36.677
lot of drinks and putting them on the table.

02:19:36.677 --> 02:19:39.537
SAM: I do have information to share with you.

02:19:39.537 --> 02:19:43.826
LIAM: We want to hear all of that information.

02:19:43.826 --> 02:19:48.504
JON: You still gotta give us the designs. No?

02:19:48.504 --> 02:19:49.761
LAURA: No.

02:19:49.761 --> 02:19:51.074
SAM: I mean.

02:19:51.074 --> 02:19:55.143
MARISHA: Why did you want the designs?

02:19:55.143 --> 02:20:01.272
SAM: Percival's guns are really cool, and I've
always wanted to have some of my own, and I used

02:20:01.272 --> 02:20:08.304
all of my ammunition over the year, and now I just
have this pistol. And I produce the pistol. But it

02:20:08.304 --> 02:20:11.670
has no bullets! I don't know how to make any more
bullets! I need more bullets!

02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:16.142
MARISHA: Are you a mafia don, Scanlan? Are you a
bad guy?

02:20:16.142 --> 02:20:18.739
SAM: I'll take off the hat.

02:20:18.739 --> 02:20:23.966
MATT: Okay. Lionel, you watch as your boss for the
past five months shifts

02:20:23.966 --> 02:20:25.736
into this tiny little man.

02:20:25.736 --> 02:20:27.531
SAM: Lionel, we'll talk about this later.

02:20:27.531 --> 02:20:28.725
JON: (screams)

02:20:28.725 --> 02:20:31.498
SAM: I have many forms and I am-- Did you just
piss your pants?

02:20:31.498 --> 02:20:35.502
JON: I'll go stand in the corner now.

02:20:35.502 --> 02:20:45.981
SAM: I have many forms and I master magic that you
will never understand, but know this: The money I

02:20:45.981 --> 02:20:49.258
pay you is real, so you still work for me.

02:20:49.258 --> 02:20:52.869
JON: That's true. Okay, I'm good.

02:20:52.869 --> 02:20:58.366
SAM: All right. Just hang tight. I mean, you can
stay, stay here. Mop yourself up or something.

02:20:58.366 --> 02:21:02.722
You're a good man. I'm sorry I do these things to
you.

02:21:02.722 --> 02:21:04.190
JON: You're so tiny, though.

02:21:04.190 --> 02:21:05.923
SAM: I'm strong of heart.

02:21:05.923 --> 02:21:08.748
JON: You haven't been that strong, but anyway.

02:21:08.748 --> 02:21:16.068
MARISHA: I pull Chod, Chard, Chode...

02:21:16.068 --> 02:21:17.767
JON: Lionel.

02:21:17.767 --> 02:21:27.153
MARISHA: Lionel. I pull Lionel aside. And I grab
him by the face, and I say, we need you to be

02:21:27.153 --> 02:21:34.229
coherent and honest during this. And I cast
Enhance Ability and give him Owl's Wisdom.

02:21:34.229 --> 02:21:35.908
MATT: Okay.

02:21:35.908 --> 02:21:38.627
JON: I'll take that. I'm not going to fight back.

02:21:38.627 --> 02:21:42.225
MARISHA: It increases your wisdom. You get
advantage on wisdom.

02:21:42.225 --> 02:21:44.783
SAM: Yeah, but now I can't erase his fucking
memory.

02:21:44.783 --> 02:21:50.462
LAURA: You've just been going crazy with that
Modify Memory, haven't you?

02:21:50.462 --> 02:21:53.833
SAM: Hey, man, it's my bag of tricks, all right?

02:21:53.833 --> 02:21:57.898
LIAM: So are we going to do this in an alleyway,
or are we going to go get a drink, and you tell us

02:21:57.898 --> 02:21:59.670
where the fuck you've been?

02:21:59.670 --> 02:22:01.858
LAURA: Should we go inside? It's an empty fucking
bar.

02:22:01.858 --> 02:22:06.938
SAM: Okay. Let's go back inside the tavern, but
just know this. He doesn't drink, all right?

02:22:06.938 --> 02:22:08.944
LAURA: Sure.

02:22:08.944 --> 02:22:13.156
LIAM: Whatever. Come on. We want to hear what
you've been doing for a year. Come on!

02:22:13.156 --> 02:22:14.231
SAM: All right.

02:22:14.231 --> 02:22:15.824
JON: Thank you for remembering.

02:22:15.824 --> 02:22:17.203
SAM: You're my guy.

02:22:17.203 --> 02:22:20.202
MATT: You guys make your way back into the
tavern.

02:22:20.202 --> 02:22:21.730
TALIESIN: It is set up.

02:22:21.730 --> 02:22:24.712
MATT: You now have the delightful experience of
roleplaying two characters,

02:22:24.712 --> 02:22:28.173
Sam, in the same scene.

02:22:28.173 --> 02:22:29.753
LIAM: Boy, that's got to suck.

02:22:29.753 --> 02:22:31.762
MATT: Welcome to my world.

02:22:31.762 --> 02:22:33.418
JON: I can kill Taryon.

02:22:33.418 --> 02:22:44.140
SAM: I have to go check on Doty! Look at the time!
Good-bye!

02:22:44.140 --> 02:22:47.927
LAURA: Look, this is that guy we were telling you
about for so long.

02:22:47.927 --> 02:22:50.329
SAM: The skeevy asshole that you always talk
about?

02:22:50.329 --> 02:22:53.033
TALIESIN: Yes, the skeevy asshole, that would be
the one.

02:22:53.033 --> 02:22:55.380
SAM: He's pretty handsome.

02:22:55.380 --> 02:22:58.742
TALIESIN: You would say that, wouldn't you?

02:22:58.742 --> 02:23:02.649
ASHLEY: I think I'll go with you, Tary.

02:23:02.649 --> 02:23:04.734
LAURA: Pike...

02:23:04.734 --> 02:23:06.227
ASHLEY: It's fine.

02:23:06.227 --> 02:23:07.651
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'll go, too.

02:23:07.651 --> 02:23:10.716
SAM: What? All right.

02:23:10.716 --> 02:23:13.096
TALIESIN: I want to listen.

02:23:13.096 --> 02:23:17.134
LIAM: I'm curious. Talk to us, man.

02:23:17.134 --> 02:23:19.001
SAM: All right.

02:23:19.001 --> 02:23:21.482
LAURA: Talk to them. Don't let them leave.

02:23:21.482 --> 02:23:24.879
SAM: You all can stay. It's been a while.

02:23:24.879 --> 02:23:26.506
TRAVIS: It has.

02:23:26.506 --> 02:23:32.114
SAM: Yes. Yes, just stay. It's fine.

02:23:32.114 --> 02:23:34.251
MARISHA: Is it, though, Scanlan?

02:23:34.251 --> 02:23:38.181
TALIESIN: What would you have done if I had just
decided to open fire on you?

02:23:38.181 --> 02:23:41.848
LAURA: I would've stopped you, darling. I knew it
was him right away.

02:23:41.848 --> 02:23:49.790
SAM: I would've done what Scanlan would always do.
I would've won and killed you. I mean, I'm super

02:23:49.790 --> 02:23:51.571
powerful and awesome.

02:23:51.571 --> 02:23:56.375
TALIESIN: Yes. But really. This was not a good
plan.

02:23:56.375 --> 02:24:02.280
MARISHA: Scanlan, there are some hurt feelings in
this room, and it might be time to address those.

02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:15.399
SAM: I know. I know. But for now, let's just catch
up. What have you guys

02:24:15.399 --> 02:24:18.158
been up to for the last year?

02:24:18.158 --> 02:24:22.182
LIAM: No, no, no. After you, dear. After you.

02:24:22.182 --> 02:24:25.287
MARISHA: I'm chief of my people!

02:24:25.287 --> 02:24:27.498
SAM: Oh, you did your Aramente!

02:24:27.498 --> 02:24:32.848
MARISHA: I did! I wish you were there! I mentioned
you and everything in my speech.

02:24:32.848 --> 02:24:33.913
SAM: You did?

02:24:33.913 --> 02:24:35.200
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:36.384
SAM: That sounds nice.

02:24:36.384 --> 02:24:37.505
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:24:37.505 --> 02:24:43.604
SAM: Anybody else ascend to new heights? No?

02:24:43.604 --> 02:24:44.784
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:24:44.784 --> 02:24:46.509
SAM: Yes?

02:24:46.509 --> 02:24:53.408
TALIESIN: Yes. None of your business at the
moment. Tell us your business.

02:24:53.408 --> 02:24:55.409
LIAM: Where have you been?

02:24:55.409 --> 02:25:02.131
SAM: I went traveling a bit. I did what gnomes do,
I went into the forest with Kaylie.

02:25:02.131 --> 02:25:11.660
ASHLEY: Oh, is that what gnomes do? They go into
the forest? I'm so sorry, please continue.

02:25:11.660 --> 02:25:24.512
SAM: Forest gnomes do. And we talked, and we sang
songs, and we camped, not in the mansion, just in

02:25:24.512 --> 02:25:33.630
a tent. We had some good times and bad times
together, and eventually we found our way to

02:25:33.630 --> 02:25:39.275
Ank'harel, and some stuff happened, yadda yadda,
and I'm here now, you know?

02:25:39.275 --> 02:25:45.784
LAURA: I try to pass my hand through Lionel's
stomach to see if he's actually Kaylie.

02:25:45.784 --> 02:25:47.311
SAM: Is he?

02:25:47.311 --> 02:25:56.414
JON: You feel tons of abs. It bounces off and hits
you in the face with your own hand.

02:25:56.414 --> 02:25:59.173
TALIESIN: I was with you on that one.

02:25:59.173 --> 02:26:01.637
LAURA: Serious, serious abs.

02:26:01.637 --> 02:26:04.079
LIAM: Where's Kaylie now?

02:26:04.079 --> 02:26:08.562
SAM: She's with me, yeah? No, did we leave her
back there?

02:26:08.562 --> 02:26:12.917
MATT: Kaylie's in Ank'harel. Essentially, you...

02:26:12.917 --> 02:26:23.988
SAM: She is... It's complicated, but right now,
she is the Meat Man. She is back in Ank'harel,

02:26:23.988 --> 02:26:27.969
taking on the business while I'm off here.

02:26:27.969 --> 02:26:31.096
LIAM: How are you two doing?

02:26:31.096 --> 02:26:35.936
SAM: Pretty good. We're a good team. Yeah.

02:26:35.936 --> 02:26:37.940
MARISHA: Does she like you now?

02:26:37.940 --> 02:26:40.932
SAM: 'Like' is a strong word.

02:26:40.932 --> 02:26:42.907
TALIESIN: It's really not.

02:26:42.907 --> 02:26:47.366
JON: 'Love' is a stronger word. That's why people
use 'like'.

02:26:47.366 --> 02:26:51.334
LIAM: There's that Owl's Wisdom right there.

02:26:51.334 --> 02:26:53.805
JON: Whoa. What just happened?

02:26:53.805 --> 02:26:56.161
TALIESIN: You have advantage on wisdom saving
throws.

02:26:56.161 --> 02:26:59.178
JON: It's weird. It's new to me.

02:26:59.178 --> 02:27:09.094
SAM: We're fine, she and I. We're a team, and
she's taught me some stuff, and I've taught her

02:27:09.094 --> 02:27:12.925
some stuff, and we operate together.

02:27:12.925 --> 02:27:19.646
MARISHA: And what kind of operation do you
operate?

02:27:19.646 --> 02:27:32.202
SAM: We went to Ank'harel to get a little simple
revenge, and it turned into something more than

02:27:32.202 --> 02:27:41.142
that, and I didn't mean to, but I guess I became
one of the

02:27:41.142 --> 02:27:44.068
three largest crime bosses in Ank'harel.

02:27:44.068 --> 02:27:46.162
LIAM: In a year.

02:27:46.162 --> 02:27:52.418
SAM: Eight months, really. We traveled around
close to here. We were only 20 miles away for most

02:27:52.418 --> 02:28:06.602
of the first couple months, and then it took us
time to get there. Don't worry, though, I'm not a

02:28:06.602 --> 02:28:17.522
bad guy. I just sell things, trinkets, furniture,
art pieces, antiquities, that sort of thing.

02:28:17.522 --> 02:28:19.068
LIAM: Nothing dangerous?

02:28:19.068 --> 02:28:21.226
SAM: Nothing dangerous. All fake.

02:28:21.226 --> 02:28:24.190
MARISHA: And to whom do you sell these things?

02:28:24.190 --> 02:28:32.153
SAM: Rat bastards. People who deserve it. People
with money to burn, and people who have done wrong

02:28:32.153 --> 02:28:35.608
in their lives. I take some back.

02:28:35.608 --> 02:28:47.825
LIAM: Why now? Why have you come back? Not that
I'm not overjoyed to see you, but I'm curious.

02:28:47.825 --> 02:28:58.073
SAM: I had information, and you had to know it.
It's important. We found another one. Lionel did.

02:28:58.073 --> 02:28:59.604
The ziggurat.

02:28:59.604 --> 02:29:01.259
LAURA: Did you go inside?

02:29:01.259 --> 02:29:04.575
JON: Another? You didn't tell me there was more!

02:29:04.575 --> 02:29:08.479
SAM: No, no, I mean, there's the one you found,
and then there's one here.

02:29:08.479 --> 02:29:09.893
JON: (gasps)

02:29:09.893 --> 02:29:13.090
SAM: Yes. Will you tell them what you saw?

02:29:13.090 --> 02:29:18.553
JON: Well, me and my buddies, we went inside
this...

02:29:18.553 --> 02:29:23.664
SAM: Can I clarify, these are all hired men of
mine. They're not his buddies. I pay them all.

02:29:23.664 --> 02:29:25.359
LIAM: Could be both.

02:29:25.359 --> 02:29:27.667
SAM: I mean, maybe they're friends now, but,
okay.

02:29:27.667 --> 02:29:29.602
JON: Well, no, they're dead now.

02:29:29.602 --> 02:29:32.436
SAM: That's fair.

02:29:32.436 --> 02:29:41.863
JON: I guess, if they weren't buddies, then I
shouldn't feel bad anymore. The bad feelings will

02:29:41.863 --> 02:29:56.714
go away. We went inside the mountain, following
some people that... Do I call you Aes, or?

02:29:56.714 --> 02:29:58.724
SAM: That's fine.

02:29:58.724 --> 02:30:01.756
JON: Okay. Aes here told us to follow some
people.

02:30:01.756 --> 02:30:09.415
SAM: I had learned of someone new coming into town
and stealing some magical artifacts and leaving

02:30:09.415 --> 02:30:17.035
some dead bodies, and it wasn't my organization,
and it wasn't any of the other two leading crime

02:30:17.035 --> 02:30:24.067
organizations, I found out through my whispers. So
it was someone new, and I wanted to find out who

02:30:24.067 --> 02:30:31.055
it was, so I sent Lionel, my best man, and his
buddies to investigate.

02:30:31.055 --> 02:30:33.963
TALIESIN: There was a comma there.

02:30:33.963 --> 02:30:41.664
JON: So, yeah, and he knew he could trust us
because we're awesome. We were going to go get

02:30:41.664 --> 02:30:47.896
some information. So we followed them into this
big tunnel that goes into the mountain. We had to

02:30:47.896 --> 02:30:55.219
go through, it took a long time and we had to
fight a lot of cool stuff along the way, but

02:30:55.219 --> 02:30:57.160
nothing important to this.

02:30:57.160 --> 02:31:03.165
SAM: I mean, all the details are good, just, when
you tell a story, lots of details.

02:31:03.165 --> 02:31:04.699
JON: Lots of details?

02:31:04.699 --> 02:31:06.708
SAM: Yeah, yeah, paints a picture.

02:31:06.708 --> 02:31:08.746
JON: Well, I've never been good at stories.

02:31:08.746 --> 02:31:10.560
MARISHA: You're doing great.

02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:20.154
JON: But when we got to the middle, we found a big
giant pyramid. Or a ziggy-star-- what?

02:31:20.154 --> 02:31:21.457
SAM: Ziggy stardust.

02:31:21.457 --> 02:31:23.816
JON: Is that what you call it?

02:31:23.816 --> 02:31:25.115
SAM: Ziggurat.

02:31:25.115 --> 02:31:28.042
LIAM: Pyramid's good. We're with you, yeah.

02:31:28.042 --> 02:31:33.567
JON: We found a pyramid, and we saw all these guys
hanging around it, and right at the top of the

02:31:33.567 --> 02:31:41.570
pyramid was this big black ball. It looked like a
pearl, but it was giant. It was at the top of the

02:31:41.570 --> 02:31:51.938
pyramid, and these guys, wearing these really cool
but scary hoods and robes, they were throwing

02:31:51.938 --> 02:31:59.196
stuff on the black orb, and it was breaking and
absorbing the stuff. And then this one guy--

02:31:59.196 --> 02:32:01.359
MARISHA: What were they throwing in?

02:32:01.359 --> 02:32:05.920
JON: Oh, it was anything. Some of them threw
treasure, some of them

02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:10.906
threw some real animals. Alive.

02:32:10.906 --> 02:32:12.678
SAM: And a person.

02:32:12.678 --> 02:32:14.198
JON: I was getting to that!

02:32:14.198 --> 02:32:16.677
SAM: Sorry, sorry, I don't want to cut you off.
Keep going. Keep going.

02:32:16.677 --> 02:32:20.003
JON: And then one of the guys actually jumped in
and it absorbed him.

02:32:20.003 --> 02:32:23.062
LAURA: Did it look like he was in pain?

02:32:23.062 --> 02:32:33.163
JON: No, it just went (sucking sound). And he was
gone. And so I had to get out of there. By then,

02:32:33.163 --> 02:32:39.645
my buddies, they were dead and taken away. So I
was the only lone survivor, and that's why you can

02:32:39.645 --> 02:32:44.317
count on me the most. He knew I would survive. Is
that why you sent them?

02:32:44.317 --> 02:32:46.358
Because you knew only I would survive?

02:32:46.358 --> 02:32:49.987
SAM: I assumed that... Yes?

02:32:49.987 --> 02:32:55.298
JON: See, I'm the best. So that's what I saw.

02:32:55.298 --> 02:32:58.213
LAURA: Was it a lot of guys?

02:32:58.213 --> 02:33:03.148
JON: There was a whole bunch of these guys in
robes. It was really creepy.

02:33:03.148 --> 02:33:05.278
SAM: And dark hoods, executioner-style.

02:33:05.278 --> 02:33:12.126
JON: Yes, matching robes, and I got a really
creepy feeling when I saw it, besides being in the

02:33:12.126 --> 02:33:13.487
middle of a mountain.

02:33:13.487 --> 02:33:14.727
LIAM: Roughly how many?

02:33:14.727 --> 02:33:16.433
JON: Oh, I don't know. I mean, it was dark.

02:33:16.433 --> 02:33:17.694
LIAM: More than us?

02:33:17.694 --> 02:33:18.887
JON: More than you.

02:33:18.887 --> 02:33:22.096
MATT: When you were there, it would've been
about 12 or 13 of them there.

02:33:22.096 --> 02:33:23.814
TALIESIN: That's a lot of matching robes.

02:33:23.814 --> 02:33:28.374
LIAM: And they all looked the same? Nobody looked
a little more important than the others?

02:33:28.374 --> 02:33:31.066
JON: I couldn't see their faces, I couldn't see.
They were all covered in these robes.

02:33:31.066 --> 02:33:32.443
It felt like...

02:33:32.443 --> 02:33:34.513
LAURA: How long ago was this?

02:33:34.513 --> 02:33:38.831
JON: This was a couple months ago. I mean, you
know, I lost track of time when we

02:33:38.831 --> 02:33:40.108
were on the ship.

02:33:40.108 --> 02:33:41.815
SAM: It's a couple weeks.

02:33:41.815 --> 02:33:46.024
(laughter)

02:33:46.024 --> 02:33:51.131
JON: I was asleep for most of the ship ride. I was
pretty sick.

02:33:51.131 --> 02:33:53.851
LAURA: I get sick, too. I understand.

02:33:53.851 --> 02:33:57.670
SAM: It was hard to tell. His face is always
green, so we couldn't really tell.

02:33:57.670 --> 02:34:03.827
JON: You guys were good. You guys gave me all the
leftover stew that you had.

02:34:03.827 --> 02:34:15.054
LAURA: So, wait, and then you saw Allura there?
That's bullshit?

02:34:15.054 --> 02:34:17.369
MATT: No, that was all bullshit.

02:34:17.369 --> 02:34:23.769
SAM: No, I'm sorry. I lied to you.

02:34:23.769 --> 02:34:28.238
LAURA: Oh. Oh, you suddenly lied to us. Wow, I
feel so shocked.

02:34:28.238 --> 02:34:33.725
SAM: I didn't know. Listen, I wanted to tell you
this information, but I didn't know how to do so.

02:34:33.725 --> 02:34:42.762
I still don't know what's going to happen. You all
might draw your knives and kill me right now, I

02:34:42.762 --> 02:34:44.420
just wanted to get this information...

02:34:44.420 --> 02:34:46.020
JON: No, they won't kill you. I promise.

02:34:46.020 --> 02:34:46.987
SAM: Thank you.

02:34:46.987 --> 02:34:48.680
LIAM: No one wants to kill you.

02:34:48.680 --> 02:34:49.836
ASHLEY: Well, that's debatable.

02:34:49.836 --> 02:34:51.682
TALIESIN: You tried to get me to give you my gun
designs?

02:34:51.682 --> 02:34:53.197
SAM: Just some ammo.

02:34:53.197 --> 02:34:54.942
TALIESIN: For what?

02:34:54.942 --> 02:34:56.272
SAM: For my gun that I have.

02:34:56.272 --> 02:34:57.520
TALIESIN: You have a gun?

02:34:57.520 --> 02:34:58.467
SAM: Yeah.

02:34:58.467 --> 02:34:59.622
MARISHA: He stole it from you.

02:34:59.622 --> 02:35:00.870
LAURA: Remember?

02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:02.520
MARISHA: No, you gave it to him!

02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:04.589
TALIESIN: No, I didn't give it to him.

02:35:04.589 --> 02:35:06.250
JON: Do you want it back?

02:35:06.250 --> 02:35:07.604
SAM: No, please don't give it back.

02:35:07.604 --> 02:35:12.755
LIAM: What's your best-case scenario here? What
did you hope would happen? You'd come and tell us

02:35:12.755 --> 02:35:14.568
these things and then what happens next?

02:35:14.568 --> 02:35:16.194
SAM: You would go investigate.

02:35:16.194 --> 02:35:17.251
LIAM: With you?

02:35:17.251 --> 02:35:21.824
SAM: No. You would go investigate and I would go
back to my job.

02:35:21.824 --> 02:35:30.787
MARISHA: So you're just here to be an errand boy.
That's all you want. To help us out.

02:35:30.787 --> 02:35:32.368
SAM: Yes.

02:35:32.368 --> 02:35:40.344
MARISHA: You traveled to a separate hemisphere to
be a messenger.

02:35:40.344 --> 02:35:42.376
JON: It was only a couple weeks.

02:35:42.376 --> 02:35:44.260
ASHLEY: Can I insight-check him?

02:35:44.260 --> 02:35:46.234
MATT: Sure.

02:35:46.234 --> 02:35:55.052
ASHLEY: 23.

02:35:55.052 --> 02:35:56.926
SAM: 37.

02:35:56.926 --> 02:35:58.713
LIAM: He's back.

02:35:58.713 --> 02:36:01.084
MATT: Hard to read.

02:36:01.084 --> 02:36:20.618
SAM: I've thought about you all a lot, during this
year, and I owe you all an apology for leaving

02:36:20.618 --> 02:36:28.766
you, and I don't know what I'll ever do to make it
up to you.

02:36:28.766 --> 02:36:35.884
LAURA: We deserved it.

02:36:35.884 --> 02:36:37.493
SAM: No, you didn't.

02:36:37.493 --> 02:36:40.245
TALIESIN: No, we didn't.

02:36:40.245 --> 02:36:51.594
SAM: There was a night. There was a night early
on, a few weeks after I left you. It was just me

02:36:51.594 --> 02:37:00.383
and Kaylie by a campfire, and she was asking me
about myself and my life, and she has this thing.

02:37:00.383 --> 02:37:10.188
I don't know if it's a spell or a special ability,
but she can always tell when I'm lying. She's the

02:37:10.188 --> 02:37:19.022
only one. And I was trying to spin some sort of
bullshit to her about my past, and she called me

02:37:19.022 --> 02:37:31.337
on it, and said, the truth. Let me hear it. And I
told her everything. I told her about all the

02:37:31.337 --> 02:37:43.087
lives I had ruined, and about the women, and about
all the other Kaylies out there that I know of,

02:37:43.087 --> 02:37:59.575
and the ones that I can only assume exist. And
everything. And she spat at me, and she gave me

02:37:59.575 --> 02:38:13.894
this scar with her knife, and she left. And I
thought that was it. I had ruined it. But before

02:38:13.894 --> 02:38:24.506
dawn, she came back, and she unrolled her bedding,
and she went to sleep, and woke up the next

02:38:24.506 --> 02:38:36.186
morning, and said, what's for breakfast, Dad? And
I realized that I've been wrong, that you don't

02:38:36.186 --> 02:38:47.719
leave your shit behind and keep going. You take it
with you, and the ones you surround yourself with

02:38:47.719 --> 02:39:00.947
better get used to the smell. And she stayed with
me despite all my flaws. And when I left you all,

02:39:00.947 --> 02:39:14.553
it was the first time that I had realized that you
were all really flawed people. Really flawed

02:39:14.553 --> 02:39:29.244
people. And I left. And I did not come back. And I
was wrong, because family sticks around even if

02:39:29.244 --> 02:39:36.281
you kind of hate the other person. And I didn't. I
betrayed you.

02:39:36.281 --> 02:39:42.118
And I've lived with that shame for a year.

02:39:42.118 --> 02:39:52.156
LIAM: Are you happier now?

02:39:52.156 --> 02:40:01.940
SAM: Well, I have a purpose. I have a job. People
depend on me.

02:40:01.940 --> 02:40:06.230
Strong people, like this guy. That's you.

02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:07.425
JON: Me?

02:40:07.425 --> 02:40:16.979
SAM: Yeah. And smart people, and Kaylie. And I'm a
pretty big shot.

02:40:16.979 --> 02:40:19.646
JON: You're not so big anymore.

02:40:19.646 --> 02:40:21.781
SAM: Well, it's a metaphor.

02:40:21.781 --> 02:40:24.242
LAURA: You always were.

02:40:24.242 --> 02:40:26.741
LIAM: That doesn't sound too bad to me.

02:40:26.741 --> 02:40:38.448
MARISHA: Did you not feel like you had a purpose
when you were with Vox Machina? I'm not judging

02:40:38.448 --> 02:40:41.502
you in the moment.

02:40:41.502 --> 02:40:50.878
SAM: I knew I was part of something, but I always
thought I was... I've been a storyteller, but I

02:40:50.878 --> 02:41:00.537
didn't think I was part of the story. And for the
last year I've been the story, and it's felt good.

02:41:00.537 --> 02:41:12.437
But I'm back, and I've given you the information,
and you can tell me what you'd like me to do next.

02:41:12.437 --> 02:41:25.471
MARISHA: You know, there is a point that we are
all family, but we are also all friends, and there

02:41:25.471 --> 02:41:33.560
is that old saying, be careful of the friends that
drag you down. Maybe we were dragging you down.

02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:54.069
TALIESIN: I'm going to put some pistol shot in a
small bag. What's Kaylie's mother's name? What is

02:41:54.069 --> 02:42:03.765
it? I toss it to him. Dick. And I leave. For the
record, it's Sybil.

02:42:03.765 --> 02:42:18.428
ASHLEY: I think I hear something. Do you hear
that? It sounds like small little violins that I

02:42:18.428 --> 02:42:21.314
hear. Do you hear that?

02:42:21.314 --> 02:42:22.877
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:42:22.877 --> 02:42:26.809
JON: I don't hear anything.

02:42:26.809 --> 02:42:39.156
(laughter)

02:42:39.156 --> 02:42:47.497
ASHLEY: I forgot I had to talk to Percy about
something. Bye. Good to see you.

02:42:47.497 --> 02:42:56.600
MARISHA: You know, you've broken a lot of hearts,
Scanlan. I think you're still a heartbreaker. And

02:42:56.600 --> 02:42:58.688
I leave with them.

02:42:58.688 --> 02:43:05.086
LAURA: I think they'll come around.

02:43:05.086 --> 02:43:07.253
SAM: I doubt it.

02:43:07.253 --> 02:43:09.631
LIAM: No, I think she's right.

02:43:09.631 --> 02:43:14.853
LAURA: I think more than anything they've just
missed you, darling.

02:43:14.853 --> 02:43:27.467
LIAM: Can I tell you a secret? All this last year,
I've known we would see you again.

02:43:27.467 --> 02:43:34.280
LAURA: He's full of shit. He totally said that you
were never coming back. I knew.

02:43:34.280 --> 02:43:39.829
LIAM: It's good to see you again.

02:43:39.829 --> 02:43:54.860
SAM: It's good to see you all. I don't really know
what to do now. I have... I really don't know what

02:43:54.860 --> 02:44:07.478
to do now. And that's a new feeling for me. I have
information. We should travel back to Ank'harel so

02:44:07.478 --> 02:44:09.255
I can show you.

02:44:09.255 --> 02:44:10.653
LAURA: Of course.

02:44:10.653 --> 02:44:22.174
SAM: And maybe then you all can decide what to do.
Whether to part ways, as friends or enemies. But I

02:44:22.174 --> 02:44:29.598
can help you. I know people there, and I can get
you safe passage, fine accommodations, the best

02:44:29.598 --> 02:44:37.035
food, even some realistic-looking antiques.

02:44:37.035 --> 02:44:40.060
LAURA: Ooh. I like it.

02:44:40.060 --> 02:44:45.411
SAM: Grog?

02:44:45.411 --> 02:44:47.479
TRAVIS: I leave.

02:44:47.479 --> 02:44:50.433
LIAM: Give him time.

02:44:50.433 --> 02:45:03.883
LAURA: Scanlan. I think you need to talk to them.
Pike didn't get to say a word to you when you

02:45:03.883 --> 02:45:06.880
left. Grog was...

02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:10.521
LIAM: Grog.

02:45:10.521 --> 02:45:13.606
LAURA: Grog was hurt.

02:45:13.606 --> 02:45:21.959
SAM: All right. Should I go now? I should give
them some time.

02:45:21.959 --> 02:45:24.919
LAURA: Maybe a little bit of breathing room, and
then, yeah.

02:45:24.919 --> 02:45:26.803
SAM: Okay.

02:45:26.803 --> 02:45:28.492
LIAM: Little steps.

02:45:28.492 --> 02:45:34.748
SAM: Lionel. Thanks for sitting through all this.
I really appreciate it.

02:45:34.748 --> 02:45:38.269
JON: I was just telling stories in my head again.

02:45:38.269 --> 02:45:42.083
SAM: Oh, really? The good ones or the bad ones?

02:45:42.083 --> 02:45:49.268
JON: The bad ones. They just pop in there.

02:45:49.268 --> 02:45:53.624
SAM: I'm sorry. I know you've had a bit of a rough
life.

02:45:53.624 --> 02:46:00.792
JON: Are you wanting me to talk about my life?

02:46:00.792 --> 02:46:07.103
SAM: No, no, no, you don't have to. We're already
weird right now, so I'm cool.

02:46:07.103 --> 02:46:12.793
MARISHA: Can we go to sleep now?

02:46:12.793 --> 02:46:14.046
MATT: Okay.

02:46:14.046 --> 02:46:15.698
SAM: It's eight AM.

02:46:15.698 --> 02:46:19.391
MARISHA: Everyone's emotionally tired.

02:46:19.391 --> 02:46:20.596
MATT: Right.

02:46:20.596 --> 02:46:23.225
TALIESIN: So are we going to see an orb in the
morning?

02:46:23.225 --> 02:46:33.297
MATT: It's midday at this point, so you guys all
go to your separate rooms and take time to

02:46:33.297 --> 02:46:36.971
yourselves independently, converse amongst
individually.

02:46:36.971 --> 02:46:39.407
TALIESIN: Pike, Grog, do you want a drink?

02:46:39.407 --> 02:46:40.341
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:46:40.341 --> 02:46:41.258
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:46:41.258 --> 02:46:43.648
LIAM: Oh, I was just about to ask you the same
thing.

02:46:43.648 --> 02:46:49.744
LAURA: Oh. Well, I mean, yeah.

02:46:49.744 --> 02:46:51.902
TALIESIN: Grog, I want to go find that orb.

02:46:51.902 --> 02:46:59.842
MARISHA: What? The orb in Ank'harel? Are we all
talking over our headpieces?

02:46:59.842 --> 02:47:01.366
I think that's what we're doing.

02:47:01.366 --> 02:47:05.143
LAURA: I'm sure Scanlan still has his. He can
probably hear us talking right now.

02:47:05.143 --> 02:47:11.167
ASHLEY: Scanlan, can you hear me now? I take out
my earpiece.

02:47:11.167 --> 02:47:14.381
MARISHA: He's a dick, he can hear us. I know the
range of these things.

02:47:14.381 --> 02:47:17.035
TRAVIS: Yeah, I take off my earpiece, too.

02:47:17.035 --> 02:47:29.006
TALIESIN: I kind of want to go work the blood out,
Scanlan or not. I like Lionel. He's funny.

02:47:29.006 --> 02:47:32.818
LIAM: We're all agreed on that, at least.

02:47:32.818 --> 02:47:42.108
MARISHA: Are we supposed to be angry, or sad, or
happy? I don't know what all these feelings are

02:47:42.108 --> 02:47:43.324
all at once.

02:47:43.324 --> 02:47:44.706
TALIESIN: You can have them all at once.

02:47:44.706 --> 02:47:45.620
MARISHA: Can I?

02:47:45.620 --> 02:47:46.948
TALIESIN: Yes. They're not exclusive.

02:47:46.948 --> 02:47:49.990
TRAVIS: Percy. Where would someone like him stay
in Whitestone?

02:47:49.990 --> 02:47:53.487
SAM: Where are you guys right now, by the way?

02:47:53.487 --> 02:47:56.557
TALIESIN: We just went to the closest pub.

02:47:56.557 --> 02:47:58.155
SAM: Is Lionel with them?

02:47:58.155 --> 02:48:01.150
MATT: Lionel's left behind with you unless you
gave him instructions otherwise.

02:48:01.150 --> 02:48:02.317
He's your bodyguard.

02:48:02.317 --> 02:48:07.362
SAM: Would you like to go with them or stay with
me in my sad room?

02:48:07.362 --> 02:48:11.709
JON: I'll go with them.

02:48:11.709 --> 02:48:14.536
(laughter)

02:48:14.536 --> 02:48:20.016
MATT: You guys sit down, you get your drinks, and
right as you're about to have this conversation,

02:48:20.016 --> 02:48:27.966
Lionel just moseys up to the table. The barmaid's
like, "Um..."

02:48:27.966 --> 02:48:30.756
TALIESIN: He learned a lot about his employer
today, I have no problem with him being here.

02:48:30.756 --> 02:48:32.468
MARISHA: Yeah, he needs a stiff drink.

02:48:32.468 --> 02:48:36.747
MATT: "Can I get you some wine, ale, beer? What
would you like?"

02:48:36.747 --> 02:48:38.494
TALIESIN: Fruit juice, maybe?

02:48:38.494 --> 02:48:42.024
JON: Do you have chocolate milk?

02:48:42.024 --> 02:48:43.962
TALIESIN: We do have hot cocoa.

02:48:43.962 --> 02:48:46.867
MATT: "I'll see what I can do." She walks away.

02:48:46.867 --> 02:48:49.388
TALIESIN: Hot cocoa is doable. We've done hot
cocoa before.

02:48:49.388 --> 02:48:51.398
MARISHA: And security blankets.

02:48:51.398 --> 02:48:56.010
TALIESIN: It's the orange blanket wrap. Grog.

02:48:56.010 --> 02:48:57.551
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

02:48:57.551 --> 02:49:01.700
TALIESIN: What do you think?

02:49:01.700 --> 02:49:07.378
TRAVIS: Lionel. Real strong, are you?

02:49:07.378 --> 02:49:13.487
JON: I'm really strong. I don't know a lot of
things, but I think I know that.

02:49:13.487 --> 02:49:18.371
TRAVIS: Aes. Does he depend on you?

02:49:18.371 --> 02:49:20.204
JON: He does.

02:49:20.204 --> 02:49:23.034
TRAVIS: How long have you known him?

02:49:23.034 --> 02:49:31.528
JON: Probably about... Well, I'm not really good
with years, or days or months, but probably a lot

02:49:31.528 --> 02:49:34.841
of days. Maybe a year.

02:49:34.841 --> 02:49:39.959
TRAVIS: How strong do you think you are?

02:49:39.959 --> 02:49:45.699
JON: The other day I tried to high-five a--

02:49:45.699 --> 02:49:49.110
TRAVIS: I reach across the table and I just punch
him in the face.

02:49:49.110 --> 02:49:50.696
MATT: All right. Roll for an attack.

02:49:50.696 --> 02:49:54.745
LIAM: I love the malice radiating this way, and
the absolute lack of recognition.

02:49:54.745 --> 02:49:59.076
MARISHA: It stops here. It stops at the camera
line.

02:49:59.076 --> 02:50:00.873
TRAVIS: 24.

02:50:00.873 --> 02:50:02.227
MATT: So what's your armor class?

02:50:02.227 --> 02:50:03.319
JON: 18.

02:50:03.319 --> 02:50:12.924
MATT: 18. Go ahead and roll, for this here, I'd
say a d4. Why not? Because you guys are pretty

02:50:12.924 --> 02:50:15.266
beefy. A d4 and add your strength modifier.

02:50:15.266 --> 02:50:18.721
TRAVIS: Nine. Ten, sorry.

02:50:18.721 --> 02:50:24.035
MATT: He comes across and cold-cocks you in the
chin. You take ten points of damage from a single

02:50:24.035 --> 02:50:33.226
punch. You feel a looseness to one of your back
teeth, and the white hits you, and your vision

02:50:33.226 --> 02:50:39.556
clears for a second, and you look over and you see
the beefy, gray-skinned goliath, his fist still

02:50:39.556 --> 02:50:43.119
extended as he pulls it back, staring right at
you.

02:50:43.119 --> 02:50:45.986
JON: Whoa, that hurt!

02:50:45.986 --> 02:50:53.199
TRAVIS: Yeah. This bar, there's a lot more where
that came from. All you can eat, yeah.

02:50:53.199 --> 02:50:58.633
JON: Show me! That was awesome!

02:50:58.633 --> 02:51:00.000
TRAVIS: Rage.

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:01.933
LAURA: Oh no! Oh no.

02:51:01.933 --> 02:51:03.300
TRAVIS: Total rage.

02:51:03.300 --> 02:51:04.689
LIAM: We're not here.

02:51:04.689 --> 02:51:05.680
LAURA: Yes, we are.

02:51:05.680 --> 02:51:07.271
LIAM: I thought you and I-- I asked...

02:51:07.271 --> 02:51:09.992
LAURA: I thought we all said we went.

02:51:09.992 --> 02:51:13.085
LIAM: They all left, we were behind. This is the
problem when

02:51:13.085 --> 02:51:15.085
everybody's thoughts are in different heads.

02:51:15.085 --> 02:51:18.134
MATT: Do you guys want to be in the same bar or
not, that's my question right now.

02:51:18.134 --> 02:51:21.091
LAURA: We don't have to be. Okay, then no. We're
not there, then.

02:51:21.091 --> 02:51:25.095
MATT: Okay, so you're not there. This is happening
between you guys. Grog goes into a rage.

02:51:25.095 --> 02:51:26.563
TRAVIS: Are we at a bar? At a table?

02:51:26.563 --> 02:51:30.758
MATT: You guys are in a tavern. There's a few
people, and as soon as that punch happened, a few

02:51:30.758 --> 02:51:34.524
people were like, "Ooh!" in the background, and as
soon as you stand up and go into a rage, people

02:51:34.524 --> 02:51:37.166
begin to back out of the way. Tables are being
pushed to the side.

02:51:37.166 --> 02:51:39.723
TALIESIN: I'm pulling gold out to pay for this.

02:51:39.723 --> 02:51:46.934
JON: I think it's awesome. I'm like, I want to
fight back. But not-- it's play for me, now.

02:51:46.934 --> 02:51:49.381
MATT: So then, I want you guys both to roll
initiative.

02:51:49.381 --> 02:51:51.813
MARISHA: Grog, don't kill him! Grog, don't kill
him!

02:51:51.813 --> 02:51:57.967
JON: What's my initiative? Oh, plus one. So what
is that, a six? That's a nine. So ten?

02:51:57.967 --> 02:51:59.137
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:51:59.137 --> 02:52:00.133
JON: Ten.

02:52:00.133 --> 02:52:01.163
TRAVIS: 14.

02:52:01.163 --> 02:52:07.669
MATT: All right, so as you get up, you're like
"All right!" And this guy-- you're used to being

02:52:07.669 --> 02:52:10.620
the biggest guy in the room. He's a little bigger
than you.

02:52:10.620 --> 02:52:15.145
SAM: I, Taryon Darrington, rolled a 14.

02:52:15.145 --> 02:52:16.528
JON: You're not here.

02:52:16.528 --> 02:52:17.767
SAM: I'm with you guys.

02:52:17.767 --> 02:52:19.381
MATT: He did come with them, yeah.

02:52:19.381 --> 02:52:21.052
JON: I thought you said-- Oh, Taryon.

02:52:21.052 --> 02:52:27.065
SAM: I'm Taryon Darrington. I stand up and I say,
I've seen this before. He will attack brutally.

02:52:27.065 --> 02:52:40.644
Drink this. And I shove a Swift Step draught in
his mouth. You can run 80 feet now every turn.

02:52:40.644 --> 02:52:44.492
MATT: All right, so you can move pretty fast if
you want to.

02:52:44.492 --> 02:52:50.197
MARISHA: Keyleth is just watching intently, and
more importantly watching Grog, making sure he

02:52:50.197 --> 02:52:55.131
doesn't actually beat him to death. We'll stop
this if it gets bad.

02:52:55.131 --> 02:52:57.582
ASHLEY: I take a seat on a bar stool and just
start drinking.

02:52:57.582 --> 02:52:59.452
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're sitting next to you.

02:52:59.452 --> 02:53:03.865
MATT: As you're preparing, Grog, this guy who's a
little larger than you are, and as soon as he

02:53:03.865 --> 02:53:06.780
stands up you're like, "Oh!" And he's quicker than
you thought. Grog, what are you gonna do?

02:53:06.780 --> 02:53:09.194
TRAVIS: Are we at a table or the bar?

02:53:09.194 --> 02:53:10.512
MATT: You are, yeah.

02:53:10.512 --> 02:53:12.680
TRAVIS: At a table or at the bar?

02:53:12.680 --> 02:53:14.974
MATT: Oh, you were at a table within the bar.

02:53:14.974 --> 02:53:20.037
TRAVIS: Magnificent. I flip up the table in my
hands and I smash it over his head.

02:53:20.037 --> 02:53:22.184
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.

02:53:22.184 --> 02:53:25.690
TALIESIN: That doesn't belong to you. That's
coming out of my coffer.

02:53:25.690 --> 02:53:27.080
TRAVIS: 25.

02:53:27.080 --> 02:53:32.131
MATT: 25, okay. That hits. Go ahead and roll
another d4.

02:53:32.131 --> 02:53:34.778
JON: So I'm quick but not that quick.

02:53:34.778 --> 02:53:36.693
TRAVIS: 12.

02:53:36.693 --> 02:53:43.375
MATT: 12 points of bludgeoning damage to you as he
smashes the table over your head. Lionel, the wood

02:53:43.375 --> 02:53:48.950
splinters and breaks around you, and you hear the
crack of the broken wood, and you can feel the

02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:53.697
splinters shred across the edge of your shoulders,
causing the burst of warmth and blood begin to

02:53:53.697 --> 02:53:59.410
flow to the top of your shoulders, and you're
like, "Oh, this is exhilarating." All right.

02:53:59.410 --> 02:54:02.101
That's your turn? All right, Lionel, you're up.

02:54:02.101 --> 02:54:04.693
JON: Okay! To fight?

02:54:04.693 --> 02:54:06.290
TALIESIN: You can do anything you like.

02:54:06.290 --> 02:54:09.862
JON: Yeah, I definitely want to fight back because
this is fun.

02:54:09.862 --> 02:54:12.234
TALIESIN: Cool. Here to help.

02:54:12.234 --> 02:54:14.890
MATT: It's a bonus action to rage if you want.

02:54:14.890 --> 02:54:17.083
JON: Yeah, but I like the-- What?

02:54:17.083 --> 02:54:19.030
MATT: It's a bonus action to rage, if you want to
do that.

02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:24.321
JON: Yeah, I saw his rage, and I-- no, I'm going
to rage, because I want to mimic. Like, hey, I can

02:54:24.321 --> 02:54:28.468
rage, too! Watch this! So do I roll that?

02:54:28.468 --> 02:54:32.927
MATT: No, no. You're now raging, so now your
muscles swell, the veins bulge out, with this big

02:54:32.927 --> 02:54:38.854
grin on his mouth. When Grog's raging, Grog's
angry rage. He's happy rage.

02:54:38.854 --> 02:54:44.776
JON: Oh, check it out! You can see my veins go
(jingling).

02:54:44.776 --> 02:54:47.443
MATT: So what do you want to do for your turn?

02:54:47.443 --> 02:54:57.520
JON: I want to go and do... So I run up to him,
and I go to do the really cool thing I heard in a

02:54:57.520 --> 02:55:02.619
cool story where I twist up my fist and I go
(whoosh) (pow). I've always wanted to try this,

02:55:02.619 --> 02:55:05.420
and this looks like a better time than ever to try
it out.

02:55:05.420 --> 02:55:10.779
MATT: So, roll for an attack and it's plus ten.
We'll say plus ten for this.

02:55:10.779 --> 02:55:15.389
JON: 17.

02:55:15.389 --> 02:55:20.425
MATT: What's your AC? 17? Go ahead and roll a d4
and add your strength modifier,

02:55:20.425 --> 02:55:22.674
which I think is a plus five.

02:55:22.674 --> 02:55:25.750
JON: And I am looking for what?

02:55:25.930 --> 02:55:28.861
TALIESIN: And you add five for your strength, so
you got--

02:55:28.861 --> 02:55:30.878
JON: So, eight.

02:55:30.878 --> 02:55:33.494
MATT: So, eight points of bludgeoning damage. You
take four, Grog.

02:55:33.494 --> 02:55:38.409
SAM: Plus three damage.

02:55:38.409 --> 02:55:43.908
MATT: Oh, plus three damage on top of that! So,
eight, so 11. Sorry, you take five.

02:55:43.908 --> 02:55:47.886
SAM: He takes half-damage. But you did great.

02:55:47.886 --> 02:55:51.090
MATT: You're both raging. You're both taking the
lesser damage of each hit.

02:55:51.090 --> 02:55:55.878
SAM: You get two attacks, but you're raging, so
you get a third attack?

02:55:55.878 --> 02:56:00.092
MATT: No, Grog has that ability. He has a
different-- he's not a frenzy barbarian.

02:56:00.146 --> 02:56:01.634
SAM: But he does get two attacks.

02:56:01.634 --> 02:56:03.381
MATT: He does get two attacks. So you get to
attack again.

02:56:03.381 --> 02:56:09.800
JON: This time, I run around him because I'm super
quick and like using this new speed I've never

02:56:09.800 --> 02:56:15.969
experienced. And I jump on his back from around
and I try to choke him.

02:56:15.969 --> 02:56:17.396
TALIESIN: Grapple.

02:56:17.396 --> 02:56:19.449
MATT: Go ahead and roll an athletics check.

02:56:19.449 --> 02:56:24.181
TALIESIN: That plus ten.

02:56:24.181 --> 02:56:27.432
JON: 23.

02:56:27.432 --> 02:56:31.119
MATT: You go ahead and roll an athletics or
acrobatics check to resist it.

02:56:31.119 --> 02:56:33.303
SAM: Oh, shit, his is huge.

02:56:33.303 --> 02:56:35.976
TRAVIS: That's not great. That's a 14.

02:56:36.052 --> 02:56:42.117
MATT: 14. You leap up behind him and put your arm
up under. His jaw's like concrete, but you still

02:56:42.117 --> 02:56:47.271
find the one soft part and jam your bulging
forearm up into that space and you feel the

02:56:47.271 --> 02:56:49.907
windpipe (choke) close and clench in.

02:56:49.907 --> 02:56:51.540
TRAVIS: (choking sounds)

02:56:51.540 --> 02:56:55.415
MATT: And your really, really fast feet are now
dangling about two inches off the ground as you're

02:56:55.415 --> 02:56:58.499
on his back right now. That's the end of your
turn. You're currently grappled, Grog,

02:56:58.499 --> 02:57:00.490
what are you going to do?

02:57:00.490 --> 02:57:03.303
TRAVIS: (choking sounds) I'm going to put it in
reverse straight towards the wall.

02:57:03.303 --> 02:57:10.252
MATT: Go ahead and roll. Are you just going to
stay holding on as you're doing it?

02:57:10.252 --> 02:57:15.759
JON: Yeah. Yeah. Because this is the first
piggyback he's ever had.

02:57:15.759 --> 02:57:21.628
MATT: It's kind of fun for a second before you hit
the wood. Wham! I'll say, go ahead and roll a

02:57:21.628 --> 02:57:27.930
strength saving throw to see if you can maintain
the hold after the slam.

02:57:27.930 --> 02:57:29.133
JON: 18.

02:57:29.133 --> 02:57:33.482
MATT: 18. Okay, I'd say that's enough for the
strength of the hold. So he keeps holding on after

02:57:33.482 --> 02:57:35.647
the slam in the back. Anything else you're going
to do with your turn?

02:57:35.647 --> 02:57:39.702
TRAVIS: My action. I take my elbow, raise it up
and drive it into his ribs.

02:57:39.702 --> 02:57:41.377
MATT: Okay, roll for an attack.

02:57:41.377 --> 02:57:44.808
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's a 28.

02:57:44.808 --> 02:57:46.839
MATT: Yeah, so 1d4.

02:57:46.839 --> 02:57:50.380
SAM: Now he has to roll damage.

02:57:50.380 --> 02:57:52.370
TRAVIS: Ten.

02:57:52.370 --> 02:58:01.164
MATT: So, ten damage halved to five and you have
an ability as reaction, if you remember. It's in

02:58:01.164 --> 02:58:04.534
your totem abilities that you can use as a
reaction.

02:58:04.534 --> 02:58:07.806
JON: Oh! Off a Duck's Back!

02:58:07.806 --> 02:58:09.904
MARISHA: Off a Duck's Back?!

02:58:09.904 --> 02:58:17.379
JON: The duck is my animal totem, you guys. I can
explain that later.

02:58:17.379 --> 02:58:23.267
MATT: So, as you go to slam him with your elbow,
you hit, but you feel like your elbow slips off

02:58:23.267 --> 02:58:28.526
his body and doesn't quite do the damage you hoped
it would. So you take two points of damage.

02:58:28.526 --> 02:58:30.185
JON: Sweet!

02:58:30.185 --> 02:58:32.303
TALIESIN: Covered in duck butter.

02:58:32.303 --> 02:58:36.053
LIAM: It's the saxophone player from Lost Boys:
greased up!

02:58:36.053 --> 02:58:41.451
TRAVIS: For my second attack, can I throw my head
back in a headbutt?

02:58:41.451 --> 02:58:43.267
MATT: Go for it, roll for an attack.

02:58:43.267 --> 02:58:45.323
TRAVIS: Yeah, 23.

02:58:45.323 --> 02:58:48.640
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll 1d4 plus
strength.

02:58:48.640 --> 02:58:50.029
TRAVIS: 11.

02:58:50.029 --> 02:58:55.105
MATT: 11. So you take five points of bludgeoning
damage, because you can only use that reaction

02:58:55.105 --> 02:58:56.427
once per round.

02:58:56.427 --> 02:58:59.770
JON: I took five points.

02:58:59.770 --> 02:59:03.227
MATT: You have to use an action to try and break
free of a grapple. So you took five, yeah. So

02:59:03.227 --> 02:59:06.502
now it's back to your turn. He slammed you into
the wall, he's elbowed you twice in the stomach,

02:59:06.502 --> 02:59:08.869
you've resisted some of it, you're still holding
him there.

02:59:08.869 --> 02:59:10.343
JON: Okay.

02:59:10.343 --> 02:59:18.305
MATT: So if you wanted to, because of one of the
feats you have, you could turn that into a pin if

02:59:18.305 --> 02:59:19.509
you wanted to.

02:59:19.509 --> 02:59:20.965
JON: One of the feats I have?

02:59:20.965 --> 02:59:22.547
MATT: Yeah, it's on the bottom.

02:59:22.547 --> 02:59:25.758
JON: Now this is turning into a wrestling match, I
like that.

02:59:25.758 --> 02:59:31.802
MATT: Or you could just keep whaling on him.

02:59:31.802 --> 02:59:37.925
JON: I want to take him out. Not kill. He's just
having fun.

02:59:37.925 --> 02:59:42.163
MARISHA: It's going down in the Whole Foods
parking lot!

02:59:42.163 --> 02:59:45.728
JON: So I'm still hanging on him.

02:59:45.817 --> 02:59:49.030
MATT: Yeah, you're holding onto him by throat, he
slammed you against the wall, he's elbowed you in

02:59:49.030 --> 02:59:50.516
the stomach twice.

02:59:50.516 --> 02:59:55.544
JON: I'm, again, having fun, superspeed. I'm going
to, while holding onto him, crawl up his back and

02:59:55.544 --> 03:00:01.133
jump over and try to land and try to do the move
where I do that and throw him.

03:00:01.133 --> 03:00:02.786
ALL: Yeah!

03:00:02.786 --> 03:00:09.074
JON: Yeah, against one of the pillars in the bar,
away from the innocent people.

03:00:09.074 --> 03:00:21.132
MATT: Make an athletics check. And you have
advantage on this because you're raging, so you

03:00:21.132 --> 03:00:23.481
roll twice and take the higher of the two.

03:00:23.481 --> 03:00:24.662
JON: Oh, it's just the best?

03:00:24.662 --> 03:00:27.213
TALIESIN: Roll again. Yeah, roll again, best of
two. Better!

03:00:27.213 --> 03:00:29.193
JON: 22.

03:00:29.193 --> 03:00:36.380
MATT: Okay, 22. Grog, I'm going to say, because
you're grappled, go ahead and roll an athletics

03:00:36.380 --> 03:00:37.598
check with disadvantage.

03:00:37.598 --> 03:00:39.564
TRAVIS: You got it.

03:00:39.564 --> 03:00:42.993
MATT: It should be one roll, because you're
raging, you also

03:00:42.993 --> 03:00:44.557
get advantage on it, technically.

03:00:44.557 --> 03:00:46.019
TRAVIS: Just one roll? 24.

03:00:46.019 --> 03:00:49.974
MATT: 24. You reach off, you leap over and you
grab him and you go to pull and it's like pulling

03:00:49.974 --> 03:00:58.216
a pillar. Not budging. You can try again if you
want to, or do something else.

03:00:58.216 --> 03:00:59.690
MARISHA: Oh, because he has a second...

03:00:59.690 --> 03:01:00.985
MATT: He has a second attack, yeah.

03:01:00.985 --> 03:01:12.416
JON: I tried to jump over, so now I'm just--
Actually, I did the flip but I didn't pull him, so

03:01:12.416 --> 03:01:16.037
now I'm just hanging on the front of him. I'm
still holding on,

03:01:16.037 --> 03:01:19.124
but now I'm in front of him, dangling.

03:01:19.124 --> 03:01:21.009
MATT: He's stand-spooning you.

03:01:21.009 --> 03:01:24.009
TRAVIS: What is this?

03:01:24.009 --> 03:01:28.199
JON: Yeah, so now I--

03:01:28.199 --> 03:01:29.933
SAM: Reverse pile-drive.

03:01:29.933 --> 03:01:33.563
TALIESIN: Go for it! Don't think, act!

03:01:33.563 --> 03:01:36.484
JON: Well, I want to start--

03:01:36.484 --> 03:01:38.139
MARISHA: What would Chode do?

03:01:38.139 --> 03:01:46.408
JON: Well, this is play for him, so I don't know,
this is not an attack, I just want to tickle him.

03:01:46.408 --> 03:01:56.344
Kind of grinding on him. In a way, trying to use that
to his advantage to make him uncomfortable.

03:01:56.344 --> 03:01:58.292
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

03:01:58.292 --> 03:02:00.518
JON: That's an intimidation, okay.

03:02:00.518 --> 03:02:02.313
MATT: Against Grog? Yeah.

03:02:02.313 --> 03:02:08.676
JON: 27.

03:02:08.676 --> 03:02:11.925
TALIESIN: Oh! Grog's ticklish!

03:02:11.925 --> 03:02:15.107
MATT: Grog, make a wisdom saving throw.

03:02:15.107 --> 03:02:19.541
TRAVIS: Minus two. Four.

03:02:19.541 --> 03:02:24.093
JON: You guys get what I'm doing.

03:02:24.093 --> 03:02:30.773
MATT: I'm going to say, for the purposes of this,
it catches you so off-guard and it's so unexpected

03:02:30.773 --> 03:02:32.513
that you're stunned for the next round.

03:02:32.513 --> 03:02:34.354
ALL: Oh!

03:02:34.354 --> 03:02:39.374
MATT: As you do that, you see him walk up and he
starts pushing you away.

03:02:39.374 --> 03:02:41.322
JON: Does he let go? I can let go now.

03:02:41.322 --> 03:02:44.723
MATT: You can let go, yeah. He's like, "Uh, uh!"
You get a full other turn,

03:02:44.723 --> 03:02:45.816
what are you going to do?

03:02:45.816 --> 03:02:55.167
JON: Can I run back, and then do a (yelling) and
then I just dive in with the biggest punch I can.

03:02:55.167 --> 03:02:58.057
MATT: Go for it. You back away, you leap--

03:02:58.057 --> 03:03:01.790
JON: Yeah, everything I can put into it, all
force, because

03:03:01.790 --> 03:03:03.592
I still want to get a good punch in there.

03:03:03.592 --> 03:03:06.956
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll for an attack. If
you want it, you can make it reckless.

03:03:06.956 --> 03:03:16.652
JON: Yeah, he's definitely reckless.

03:03:16.652 --> 03:03:20.485
MATT: So roll twice and take the higher on each
attack.

03:03:20.485 --> 03:03:24.078
JON: 15. What is that?

03:03:24.078 --> 03:03:25.477
TALIESIN: That's a 20.

03:03:25.477 --> 03:03:27.563
SAM: Oh, that crits!

03:03:27.563 --> 03:03:30.632
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d4.

03:03:30.632 --> 03:03:39.723
TALIESIN: He's also got Brutal Critical, so that
adds 2d6 to that, but we'll get to that.

03:03:39.723 --> 03:03:46.694
MATT: Technically, it would add a d4, because he's
not using his sword. So, roll that twice and then

03:03:46.694 --> 03:03:48.509
add your strength.

03:03:48.509 --> 03:03:54.290
JON: 15.

03:03:54.290 --> 03:03:57.044
SAM: But he's raging, so another three.

03:03:57.044 --> 03:04:04.026
JON: 16.

03:04:04.026 --> 03:04:06.585
MATT: 16 points of bludgeoning damage to you,
Grog. That's eight.

03:04:06.585 --> 03:04:08.187
TRAVIS: Eight, got it.

03:04:08.187 --> 03:04:12.660
LAURA: How are you doing, Grog? Are you still
okay? Are you bloodied yet?

03:04:12.660 --> 03:04:14.862
SAM: He's down 22 hit points.

03:04:14.862 --> 03:04:24.309
MATT: As your first attack, you run in. Right as
soon as he looks up, you're smiling as you come at

03:04:24.309 --> 03:04:31.763
him. You watch as the beard shakes in opposition
of the jaw quiver and you feel and can taste the

03:04:31.763 --> 03:04:35.641
iron welling up in the back of your tongue as you
may have bitten off a small piece of the back of

03:04:35.641 --> 03:04:39.100
your tongue. As soon as you land from that punch,
he looks a little stunned. You have a second

03:04:39.100 --> 03:04:40.451
attack if you want to.

03:04:40.451 --> 03:04:49.487
JON: I'm going to do my Wave Kick. That's just
something he's always wanted to try, he doesn't

03:04:49.487 --> 03:04:54.745
know if it'll work. It's where he does a
full-body--

03:04:54.745 --> 03:04:56.934
and then his foot kicks him right in the groin.

03:04:56.934 --> 03:05:00.404
MATT: Awesome. You've practiced this alone many
times, this is your first chance to actually use

03:05:00.404 --> 03:05:03.497
it. So go ahead and make an attack for your Wave
Kick.

03:05:03.497 --> 03:05:07.721
JON: Right in the crotch.

03:05:07.721 --> 03:05:11.145
LIAM: Lionel, with his nunchucks, in the family
den.

03:05:11.145 --> 03:05:13.211
MATT: Basically.

03:05:13.211 --> 03:05:14.680
JON: So just an attack?

03:05:14.680 --> 03:05:16.935
MATT: Well, it's reckless, so you roll twice, take
the higher.

03:05:16.935 --> 03:05:19.158
TALIESIN: Roll again. Better.

03:05:19.158 --> 03:05:20.604
JON: 17.

03:05:20.604 --> 03:05:24.369
MATT: So go ahead and roll a d4 and add your
damage.

03:05:24.369 --> 03:05:27.241
JON: One.

03:05:27.241 --> 03:05:29.576
SAM: Plus five is six?

03:05:29.576 --> 03:05:31.238
TALIESIN: No, you only roll the d4 once.

03:05:31.238 --> 03:05:33.606
SAM: So one plus five plus three.

03:05:33.606 --> 03:05:39.302
MATT: Okay, so nine. You take four points of
bludgeoning damage, Grog, and you just took a

03:05:39.302 --> 03:05:46.343
swift Wave Kick to the groin, as he kind of
(whack). Little snap right to the nuts, so it's

03:05:46.343 --> 03:05:56.448
not like an immediate pain, it's the tap. The dull
nausea pain, and he seems to shake a little from

03:05:56.448 --> 03:06:02.071
the impact as he kinda grins and glares at you
with his angry eyes. Well done. Grog?

03:06:02.071 --> 03:06:05.923
ASHLEY: (deadpan) Grog, stop, no, don't kill him.

03:06:05.923 --> 03:06:13.921
TRAVIS: I'm so confused. I've never had another
male do that to my body. He shimmied on me. And

03:06:13.921 --> 03:06:20.875
then he punched me. And then he kicked me in the
jellies.

03:06:20.875 --> 03:06:23.386
I turn around and I leave.

03:06:23.386 --> 03:06:25.964
(gasping)

03:06:25.964 --> 03:06:29.250
MATT: He just walked away.

03:06:29.250 --> 03:06:34.267
SAM: It's over?

03:06:34.267 --> 03:06:39.078
JON: That was fun, you guys. That was fun.

03:06:39.078 --> 03:06:41.687
TALIESIN: Pike, do you want to go deal with that?

03:06:41.687 --> 03:06:44.610
JON: I was just having fun. Is he all right?

03:06:44.610 --> 03:06:46.252
TALIESIN: He'll be fine.

03:06:46.252 --> 03:06:50.580
MARISHA: I've never seen Grog walk away from a
fight. He's not fine. What are you talking about?

03:06:50.580 --> 03:06:53.095
TALIESIN: I didn't say he's fine, I said he will
be fine.

03:06:53.095 --> 03:06:57.531
SAM: I'm pretty sure this makes you a member of
Vox Machina now.

03:06:57.531 --> 03:07:00.772
TALIESIN: Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

03:07:00.772 --> 03:07:03.617
SAM: Well, that's what happened to me, they
attacked me and then I was in.

03:07:03.617 --> 03:07:07.456
TALIESIN: There was chocolate milk on the way.

03:07:07.456 --> 03:07:13.251
MATT: You see the woman in the back is carrying
this mug and is like, "Right."

03:07:13.251 --> 03:07:15.513
SAM: He'll need a straw.

03:07:15.513 --> 03:07:19.633
MATT: "Here's your chocolate milk."

03:07:19.633 --> 03:07:25.540
JON: Anybody else want to fight?

03:07:25.540 --> 03:07:27.453
ASHLEY: I punch him across the face.

03:07:27.453 --> 03:07:29.047
(cheering)

03:07:29.047 --> 03:07:31.446
MATT: You get the chocolate milk to your mouth,
before (impact sound)

03:07:31.446 --> 03:07:34.003
knocks it right out of your hand.

03:07:34.003 --> 03:07:37.104
TALIESIN: Were you standing on the table when this
happened? I'm so excited.

03:07:37.104 --> 03:07:42.593
MATT: And you watch, the fist comes across, and
the gnome that is in an arc of movement lands on her

03:07:42.593 --> 03:07:48.615
feet. You look down and you can see the
white-haired, fully armored gnome there with her

03:07:48.615 --> 03:07:52.378
big gauntlets is now there below you, kind of
grinning and growling.

03:07:52.378 --> 03:07:55.472
MARISHA: That was good chocolate milk!

03:07:55.472 --> 03:07:57.066
TALIESIN: We'll have another.

03:07:57.066 --> 03:08:00.694
JON: I'm bummed about the chocolate. You guys have
any more chocolate milk?

03:08:00.694 --> 03:08:02.378
MATT: "Yeah."

03:08:02.378 --> 03:08:03.553
TALIESIN: Another round.

03:08:03.553 --> 03:08:05.309
MATT: "Okay." She wanders off.

03:08:05.309 --> 03:08:07.184
MARISHA: Chocolate's expensive, here.

03:08:07.184 --> 03:08:11.474
JON: That was awesome.

03:08:11.474 --> 03:08:13.815
TALIESIN: She can take it.

03:08:13.815 --> 03:08:21.499
ASHLEY: I'm pretty awesome. I finish my ale, flick
a money on the bar, and leave. Oh shit, I don't

03:08:21.499 --> 03:08:24.222
have any money, because I gave it all away. Tary,
Tary?

03:08:24.222 --> 03:08:25.606
TALIESIN: I'm covering, I'm covering.

03:08:25.606 --> 03:08:27.614
SAM: Thank you, because I don't have much.

03:08:27.614 --> 03:08:29.872
MATT: She goes, "And the table?"

03:08:29.872 --> 03:08:34.770
TALIESIN: Sorry. There's a pile that's been
growing on the table of gold for the furniture.

03:08:34.770 --> 03:08:38.735
MATT: "All right, thank you." Brings you another
round of chocolate milk.

03:08:38.735 --> 03:08:42.904
JON: Is anybody going to hit me before I drink
this?

03:08:42.904 --> 03:08:44.778
TALIESIN: No, I think that's done now.

03:08:44.778 --> 03:08:49.848
JON: I'm not, like, I'm not checking. It's fine if
you do. Okay.

03:08:49.848 --> 03:08:51.273
MARISHA: Just drink it first.

03:08:51.273 --> 03:08:53.873
TALIESIN: I think it's chocolate milk time.

03:08:53.873 --> 03:08:55.485
JON: Mmm.

03:08:55.485 --> 03:09:00.349
TALIESIN: Maybe I drink too much. I'm not sure.
This is really nice.

03:09:00.349 --> 03:09:11.478
JON: I just want to say, you guys, this is the
most fun I've had in a long time. Aes, or you guys

03:09:11.478 --> 03:09:13.888
call him Scanlan?

03:09:13.888 --> 03:09:16.143
TALIESIN: Aes is fine, Aes is fine.

03:09:16.143 --> 03:09:25.526
JON: He's all I've known for the past year, you
know? He took me in when, you know, things weren't

03:09:25.526 --> 03:09:33.510
going too well for me. And it's been great. He had
a really cool speech about family, I've never

03:09:33.510 --> 03:09:37.603
heard him talk like that. It was kind of weird,
because he's always been this really tough guy,

03:09:37.603 --> 03:09:44.299
but I don't know if you guys realize that I just
found out he lied to me for a year.

03:09:44.299 --> 03:09:53.147
TALIESIN: No, we know. It's why we took you to a
bar. He's lied to us, too.

03:09:53.147 --> 03:09:59.608
JON: Well, I know that he lied to you, and I just
found out that he lied to me, but it's okay.

03:09:59.608 --> 03:10:01.416
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:10:01.416 --> 03:10:05.874
JON: Because I realise that he was always there,
and even though I worked for him, and, you know,

03:10:05.874 --> 03:10:12.002
he told me what to do, and would bark orders, he
always had my back, and he was the only one who

03:10:12.002 --> 03:10:19.727
took care of me. So I think you guys should, like,
be nice to him. Or--

03:10:19.727 --> 03:10:23.175
TALIESIN: That's the trouble, he does always have
your back, until he doesn't.

03:10:23.175 --> 03:10:25.169
MARISHA: The idiot has a point.

03:10:25.169 --> 03:10:28.256
SAM: Well, let's not call names.

03:10:28.256 --> 03:10:30.610
JON: What's an idiot?

03:10:30.610 --> 03:10:32.443
MARISHA: Oh hey, Tary.

03:10:32.443 --> 03:10:33.459
SAM: Yes.

03:10:33.459 --> 03:10:34.603
MARISHA: You're still here.

03:10:34.603 --> 03:10:35.928
SAM: Yes. I am.

03:10:35.928 --> 03:10:38.108
TALIESIN: I get confused because of the cup.

03:10:38.108 --> 03:10:39.141
MARISHA: I know.

03:10:39.141 --> 03:10:44.500
SAM: Taryon Darrington, pleased to make your
acquaintance. Hi. I'm going to be leaving soon.

03:10:44.500 --> 03:10:46.668
(laughter)

03:10:46.668 --> 03:10:48.034
JON: Can I kick you in the nuts?

03:10:48.034 --> 03:10:49.986
SAM: Uh, please don't. I'm very dainty.

03:10:49.986 --> 03:10:51.008
JON: Okay.

03:10:51.008 --> 03:10:52.142
TALIESIN: Extremely dainty.

03:10:52.142 --> 03:10:54.348
JON: You guys seem like you all enjoy that kind of
stuff, it's awesome.

03:10:54.348 --> 03:10:56.025
TALIESIN: Well, you've met the couple that do.

03:10:56.025 --> 03:10:57.294
MARISHA: You're not wrong.

03:10:57.294 --> 03:11:06.566
MARISHA: Only Scanlan can make Vox Machina
speechless. It's happened a few times tonight. Did

03:11:06.566 --> 03:11:07.985
you notice that?

03:11:07.985 --> 03:11:09.469
TALIESIN: Hadn't.

03:11:09.469 --> 03:11:10.781
MARISHA: I did.

03:11:10.781 --> 03:11:13.643
TALIESIN: I'm really angry.

03:11:13.643 --> 03:11:15.948
MARISHA: What do we do?

03:11:15.948 --> 03:11:18.955
TALIESIN: I want to go see that bloody orb.

03:11:18.955 --> 03:11:20.207
MARISHA: Hey, Chode?

03:11:20.207 --> 03:11:21.447
JON: Mm?

03:11:21.447 --> 03:11:22.687
TALIESIN: Lionel.

03:11:22.687 --> 03:11:24.328
MARISHA: Sorry.

03:11:24.328 --> 03:11:26.341
TALIESIN: You're so good about this normally.

03:11:26.341 --> 03:11:29.658
JON: It's all right. At least you guys are
remembering one of my names. I had to come up with

03:11:29.658 --> 03:11:35.069
a couple-- I used to have ten, just to make it
easier for people to even call me a name.

03:11:35.069 --> 03:11:37.006
TALIESIN: I have quite a few names myself.

03:11:37.006 --> 03:11:40.091
MARISHA: Chard? Where did you come from before you
met Scanlan?

03:11:40.091 --> 03:11:48.590
JON: Well, I lived in the desert. I woke up, I
don't remember much when I was a baby. I'm sure

03:11:48.590 --> 03:11:51.130
you guys all remember when you were babies, but--

03:11:51.130 --> 03:11:54.154
SAM: Nope. Usually not.

03:11:54.154 --> 03:11:57.388
JON: I always thought that's how it was done.

03:11:57.388 --> 03:12:01.070
SAM: Nope. Nobody does. So far, so good.

03:12:01.070 --> 03:12:03.913
TALIESIN: Don't break him, please.

03:12:03.913 --> 03:12:15.271
JON: But the only thing I knew, I was orphaned, I
didn't-- I never know my parents, 'cause I woke up

03:12:15.271 --> 03:12:20.957
in a basket, in a small creek, and the only thing
that was there were ducks.

03:12:20.957 --> 03:12:24.253
SAM: Wait, wait--

03:12:24.253 --> 03:12:26.649
TALIESIN: No, no, no, don't say wait! Go on.

03:12:26.649 --> 03:12:28.910
MARISHA: Just let him tell his story.

03:12:28.910 --> 03:12:36.040
JON: And ever since then, ducks have been my
spirit animal, and I feel like they bring me

03:12:36.040 --> 03:12:44.380
strength, and bring me-- make me smarter and they
give me courage. So I grew up in the desert. It

03:12:44.380 --> 03:12:46.029
was a rough time, but--

03:12:46.029 --> 03:12:47.999
TALIESIN: Were these desert ducks?

03:12:47.999 --> 03:12:50.662
MARISHA: Yeah, how'd you know they were ducks?
Normally ducks don't live in the desert.

03:12:50.662 --> 03:12:52.309
TALIESIN: These must have been very interesting
ducks.

03:12:52.309 --> 03:12:53.469
LIAM: They were actually vultures.

03:12:53.469 --> 03:12:54.888
(laughter)

03:12:54.888 --> 03:12:56.113
LAURA: You're not there.

03:12:56.113 --> 03:12:57.161
JON: What's a vult--

03:12:57.161 --> 03:12:59.582
TALIESIN: Nothing-- said a voice that wasn't
there. Carry on.

03:12:59.582 --> 03:13:00.859
MARISHA: They were ducks.

03:13:00.859 --> 03:13:04.920
JON: It was a small pond in the middle of the
desert.

03:13:04.920 --> 03:13:08.298
Some people called it an oasis or something.

03:13:08.298 --> 03:13:09.890
TALIESIN: An oasis, yes.

03:13:09.890 --> 03:13:13.971
JON: Now, you know, I never saw ducks again there,
so, I don't know,

03:13:13.971 --> 03:13:16.462
but I'm confident they were real.

03:13:16.462 --> 03:13:17.928
TALIESIN: Migratory, perhaps.

03:13:17.928 --> 03:13:22.517
MARISHA: The ducks blessed you. And your birth and
your survival.

03:13:22.517 --> 03:13:26.398
JON: Yeah, I just, uh--

03:13:26.398 --> 03:13:29.601
MARISHA: He doesn't know what a vulture is!
(chuckles)

03:13:29.601 --> 03:13:35.389
JON: I realised I was strong, and I could do
really, you know, awesome things with my body, so

03:13:35.389 --> 03:13:43.554
I did-- that kind of helped me when growing up,
and then finally I came to the city of--

03:13:43.554 --> 03:13:45.322
SAM: (whispers) Ank'harel.

03:13:45.322 --> 03:13:46.927
JON: Ank'harel.

03:13:46.927 --> 03:13:51.399
MARISHA: That's a continent, but-- oh wait, no,
the continent-- no, Marquet is the continent.

03:13:51.399 --> 03:13:53.132
Ank'harel is the city, okay.

03:13:53.132 --> 03:13:54.429
JON: Yeah, stupid.

03:13:54.429 --> 03:13:58.356
(laughter)

03:13:58.356 --> 03:14:00.841
MARISHA: That's fair. I've earned that.

03:14:00.841 --> 03:14:06.337
JON: Ever since I got to the city, I started using
it, but people would abuse me, and my body for

03:14:06.337 --> 03:14:18.464
its, like, abilities. So until one day, I met Aes.
He was kind, and he brought me into his family.

03:14:18.464 --> 03:14:20.967
MARISHA: Family.

03:14:20.967 --> 03:14:23.897
JON: A lot of talk of family, today.

03:14:23.897 --> 03:14:25.920
MARISHA: He talked a lot of family to you?

03:14:25.920 --> 03:14:27.125
SAM: And ducks.

03:14:27.125 --> 03:14:33.331
MARISHA: And ducks. Did he talk much more about
his family to you?

03:14:33.331 --> 03:14:41.296
JON: No, I didn't-- I didn't know he had a
daughter. I mean, there was this really, like,

03:14:41.296 --> 03:14:47.377
killer babe in our group, I didn't-- where is he?
Where's Aes, you guys?

03:14:47.377 --> 03:14:49.367
TALIESIN: Aes ain't here right now.

03:14:49.367 --> 03:14:55.371
JON: Well, don't tell him, but... I always had a
thing for her, but now that I know it's his

03:14:55.371 --> 03:14:56.677
daughter, yeesh.

03:14:56.677 --> 03:14:59.383
TALIESIN: You're not the first.

03:14:59.383 --> 03:15:05.642
JON: Yeah, that's good to know. So. But no, I
didn't know much about, you know, he didn't tell

03:15:05.642 --> 03:15:11.313
me much, I didn't ask a lot of questions. Nobody's
ever asked me questions. You guys are great.

03:15:11.313 --> 03:15:21.806
TALIESIN: Boy, that's not true. But that's good.
You're a fascinating creature, sir. Good man.

03:15:21.806 --> 03:15:30.444
MARISHA: We like you. We like you, Chode. Lionel.
We like you, Lionel. Hey, Lion. C'mere, c'mere.

03:15:30.444 --> 03:15:36.854
SAM: No.

03:15:36.854 --> 03:15:40.141
MARISHA: Parchment-boulder-shears.
Parchment-boulder-shears! I'm going to teach you.

03:15:40.141 --> 03:15:42.140
SAM: It's like rock-paper-scissors.

03:15:42.140 --> 03:15:48.739
MARISHA: Okay, ready, ready, ready? Boulder,
parchment, or shears. Okay. Ready? On three.

03:15:48.739 --> 03:15:50.867
JON and MARISHA: One, two, three.

03:15:50.867 --> 03:15:52.115
JON: I punch her.

03:15:52.115 --> 03:15:54.179
(laughter)

03:15:54.179 --> 03:15:56.238
TALIESIN: Never mind, not disappointed.

03:15:56.238 --> 03:16:04.370
MATT: As this transpires, we come over to you two,
having a drink. So you guys find a separate pub.

03:16:04.370 --> 03:16:07.958
LAURA: I figured we just sat under the Sun Tree.

03:16:07.958 --> 03:16:09.370
LIAM: Yeah, I've got a flask.

03:16:09.370 --> 03:16:12.542
MATT: Okay, so you guys sit under the Sun Tree.
It's midafternoon.

03:16:12.542 --> 03:16:20.488
LIAM: This is complicated. Real complicated.

03:16:20.488 --> 03:16:27.719
LAURA: Yeah. I was so happy to see him.

03:16:27.719 --> 03:16:32.556
LIAM: Me, too. Grog and Pike were not happy to see
him.

03:16:32.596 --> 03:16:38.117
LAURA: No. We've got to find a way to get them
talking again.

03:16:38.117 --> 03:16:53.207
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah. I think they will, but you're
right, it will take some massaging. You know, I

03:16:53.207 --> 03:16:58.595
wasn't lying, I knew we would see him again.

03:16:58.595 --> 03:17:05.477
LAURA: I know. Couldn't let him know that,
though.

03:17:05.477 --> 03:17:13.673
LIAM: This has been nice. It's always nice.

03:17:13.673 --> 03:17:17.811
LAURA: Mm-hm?

03:17:17.811 --> 03:17:26.286
LIAM: I'm real happy in my setup these days,
but--

03:17:26.286 --> 03:17:28.326
LAURA: With Keyleth?

03:17:28.326 --> 03:17:36.048
LIAM: That was the implication, yeah. But I miss
you busting my balls on the regular.

03:17:36.048 --> 03:17:42.583
LAURA: I know, right? Yeah. I miss it, too.

03:17:42.583 --> 03:17:53.001
LIAM: I think-- we were about to head back, but
we've got to get this sorted out first.

03:17:53.001 --> 03:17:54.544
LAURA: Yeah.

03:17:54.544 --> 03:17:58.285
LIAM: What do you reckon's next? We're going to
Marquet, then?

03:17:58.285 --> 03:18:00.752
LAURA: Yeah, probably Ank'harel.

03:18:00.752 --> 03:18:03.175
LIAM: You all right?

03:18:03.175 --> 03:18:04.787
LAURA: Yeah, I'm fine.

03:18:04.787 --> 03:18:06.363
LIAM: You don't seem fine.

03:18:06.363 --> 03:18:19.907
LAURA: No, I'm great. You know, it's interesting,
Scanlan being back. Makes me realize that, you

03:18:19.907 --> 03:18:24.422
know, he's not the only one who keeps secrets.

03:18:24.422 --> 03:18:26.954
LIAM: Mm-hm.

03:18:26.954 --> 03:18:32.759
LAURA: And you can't blame someone for keeping
things to themselves, so I'm not mad at him

03:18:32.759 --> 03:18:38.482
anymore for the things that he keeps to himself,
because everybody's

03:18:38.482 --> 03:18:40.383
got their something, you know?

03:18:40.383 --> 03:18:44.260
LIAM: Are you getting at something?

03:18:44.260 --> 03:18:49.361
LAURA: No, I'm just saying, I understand where
he's coming from, and I am all right with it now.

03:18:49.361 --> 03:18:53.406
I'm fine with it. With the secrets.

03:18:53.406 --> 03:18:57.586
LIAM: I feel like I'm missing something.

03:18:57.586 --> 03:18:59.863
LAURA: No, nothing at all.

03:18:59.863 --> 03:19:09.157
LIAM: Well, I'm not mad at him. I hope Pike and
Grog can come around.

03:19:09.157 --> 03:19:15.745
LAURA: I think they will. He's quite charming. I
think everyone will come around.

03:19:15.745 --> 03:19:29.004
LIAM: I hope so. I feel like, you know.

03:19:29.004 --> 03:19:35.696
LAURA: The Sun Tree? Pelor? Raven Queen?

03:19:35.696 --> 03:19:36.732
LIAM: Yeah.

03:19:36.732 --> 03:19:38.222
LAURA: Hey!

03:19:38.222 --> 03:19:40.806
(laughter)

03:19:40.806 --> 03:19:44.363
LIAM: I wonder if it's time.

03:19:44.363 --> 03:19:49.708
LAURA: Time for what?

03:19:49.708 --> 03:19:53.726
LIAM: Nothing, I'm drunk, never mind. Did you see
this ring I picked up?

03:19:53.726 --> 03:19:56.460
LAURA: (laughs) Oh, did you buy that off a little
caravan?

03:19:56.460 --> 03:19:59.274
LIAM: Yeah, while you guys were fucking about with
him.

03:19:59.274 --> 03:20:00.641
LAURA: That's great!

03:20:00.641 --> 03:20:01.771
LIAM: It's very handsome.

03:20:01.771 --> 03:20:03.428
LAURA: It's really nice. It's really nice.

03:20:03.428 --> 03:20:07.765
LIAM: Yeah. Well. I love you.

03:20:07.765 --> 03:20:12.678
LAURA: I love you. Glad we're all here. I'm glad
we're all here!

03:20:12.678 --> 03:20:16.558
LIAM: All of us. All of us. Do you want to go find
the rest?

03:20:16.558 --> 03:20:17.713
LAURA: Yeah!

03:20:17.713 --> 03:20:20.359
LIAM: Let's go find the rest.

03:20:20.359 --> 03:20:23.115
MATT: Okay, all right.

03:20:23.115 --> 03:20:25.963
MARISHA: Right as Vax walks in-- Fuck!

03:20:25.963 --> 03:20:30.775
MATT: You guys begin walking back to the pub. You've
been hearing the commotion in the distance. You assume

03:20:30.775 --> 03:20:33.552
that's it. You watch as Grog walks by in a huff.

03:20:33.552 --> 03:20:34.699
LAURA: Grog?

03:20:34.699 --> 03:20:36.702
LIAM: Big man?

03:20:36.702 --> 03:20:39.211
TRAVIS: What?

03:20:39.221 --> 03:20:42.428
LAURA: Are you all right?

03:20:42.428 --> 03:20:48.049
TRAVIS: Cat. C-A-T. And I leave.

03:20:48.049 --> 03:20:53.463
LAURA: You're so smart! Do we see Pike come out
after him?

03:20:53.463 --> 03:20:56.452
MATT: You're still in the tavern?

03:20:56.452 --> 03:20:57.665
ASHLEY: I left after him.

03:20:57.665 --> 03:21:01.181
MATT: You did. So then you watch Pike come out in
a huff a little after him.

03:21:01.181 --> 03:21:02.364
LAURA: Pike?

03:21:02.364 --> 03:21:03.701
ASHLEY: Hey!

03:21:03.701 --> 03:21:05.383
LAURA: What happened in there?

03:21:05.383 --> 03:21:10.359
ASHLEY: Oh, nothing. Just hanging out. Just having
a drink.

03:21:10.359 --> 03:21:16.583
I'm going to go take a nap, I'm very tired.

03:21:16.583 --> 03:21:17.605
LAURA: Pike.

03:21:17.605 --> 03:21:18.924
LIAM: Insight check.

03:21:18.924 --> 03:21:22.238
LAURA: Well, we don't really need to roll an
insight check to

03:21:22.238 --> 03:21:24.527
see this one's not doing so well.

03:21:24.527 --> 03:21:26.462
LIAM: It was really low.

03:21:26.462 --> 03:21:37.877
ASHLEY: I'm great! I'm all right. Just going to
sleep it off, I think.

03:21:37.877 --> 03:21:39.630
LIAM: Yeah, too much to drink, probably.

03:21:39.630 --> 03:21:44.432
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm feeling very drunk, so I'm going
to go to bed.

03:21:44.432 --> 03:21:45.784
LIAM: Pickled Pickle.

03:21:45.784 --> 03:21:50.383
ASHLEY: I'm a pickled Pickle, yeah. But I'll see
you guys tomorrow.

03:21:50.383 --> 03:21:53.877
LAURA: Everything will be better in the morning.

03:21:53.877 --> 03:21:56.389
ASHLEY: Sleep is the best medicine.

03:21:56.389 --> 03:21:59.345
SAM: You are a cleric.

03:21:59.345 --> 03:22:05.228
MATT: Pike wanders off. You guys make your way to
the tavern where the commotion's there. You walk

03:22:05.228 --> 03:22:11.722
in just as you see Keyleth and Lionel in the
process and about to play an intense game of

03:22:11.722 --> 03:22:17.044
Boulder-Parchment-Shears before Lionel just decks
Keyleth across the face.

03:22:17.044 --> 03:22:25.500
MARISHA: Hey, guys! We're playing
Boulder-Parchment-Shears! And then I Alter Self my

03:22:25.500 --> 03:22:33.418
fist into a rock elemental fist, a Keyteor fist,
and I go, see, look! Boulder!

03:22:33.418 --> 03:22:36.735
And I backhand Lionel.

03:22:36.735 --> 03:22:40.773
MATT: First off, you roll damage for her now.
That's going to be a d4 plus your...

03:22:40.773 --> 03:22:45.784
TALIESIN: d4, you already hit. Just the d4.

03:22:45.784 --> 03:22:48.887
MATT: I'll say you hit because she wasn't
expecting it.

03:22:48.887 --> 03:22:55.256
SAM: Is he still raging?

03:22:55.256 --> 03:22:59.190
MATT: He's still raging at this point. Why not?

03:22:59.190 --> 03:23:02.839
JON: I'm still raging. How long does that last?

03:23:02.839 --> 03:23:06.317
MATT: Actually, no, you'd have to be raging again
because you did do your whole duck speech.

03:23:06.317 --> 03:23:08.400
JON: Six.

03:23:08.400 --> 03:23:11.841
MATT: So you could rage and then attack.

03:23:11.841 --> 03:23:17.533
JON: So I could rage-- yeah, okay, so, that was
just-- yeah, that was all right.

03:23:17.533 --> 03:23:23.172
MATT: So you take six damage. Now, Keyleth, go ahead and
make an attack roll. With your earth elemental, I

03:23:23.172 --> 03:23:25.426
believe it's a plus what, to hit?

03:23:25.426 --> 03:23:31.760
MARISHA: Just with my fist? Sure, you want me to
use Earth elemental? I mean, yeah, yeah, totes.

03:23:31.760 --> 03:23:34.352
MATT: Just the attack bonus.

03:23:34.352 --> 03:23:38.969
MARISHA: 18.

03:23:38.969 --> 03:23:47.909
MATT: 18? What's your armor class? You just hit.
Add your strength modifier to one. So what's your

03:23:47.909 --> 03:23:49.249
strength modifier?

03:23:49.249 --> 03:23:52.707
MARISHA: Just to one? Plus five. So, six, six
damage.

03:23:52.707 --> 03:23:57.654
MATT: So, six damage, you take, whack! To the
chin. Her fist is a rock.

03:23:57.654 --> 03:23:59.553
JON: And do I take half that or no?

03:23:59.553 --> 03:24:01.670
MATT: If you started raging before that, then yes,
you would.

03:24:01.670 --> 03:24:03.078
TALIESIN: But you weren't raging yet.

03:24:03.078 --> 03:24:03.975
JON: Okay.

03:24:03.975 --> 03:24:06.201
MATT: But you can use your reaction to-- Off a
Duck's Back.

03:24:06.201 --> 03:24:07.654
JON: No, no, I don't want to.

03:24:07.654 --> 03:24:12.475
MATT: So you take the five damage right to the
jaw. Whack! So now you got both sides of the jaw

03:24:12.484 --> 03:24:14.550
ringing a little bit in pain.

03:24:14.550 --> 03:24:21.959
MARISHA: This is the best game of
Boulder-Parchment-Shears!

03:24:21.959 --> 03:24:26.461
JON: Who else wants to-- Is it just a two-player
game?

03:24:26.461 --> 03:24:32.470
TALIESIN: I am walking away with my chocolate milk
and walking over to you guys. They're bonding.

03:24:32.470 --> 03:24:37.944
JON: And as he's going, I sneak a bullet from
him.

03:24:37.944 --> 03:24:40.427
TALIESIN: You can try. You can certainly try.

03:24:40.427 --> 03:24:46.583
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for that. Roll
your sleight of hand. And Percival, I want you to

03:24:46.583 --> 03:24:50.721
go ahead and roll a perception check.

03:24:50.721 --> 03:24:54.433
TALIESIN: Perception is 19.

03:24:54.433 --> 03:24:56.557
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll.

03:24:56.557 --> 03:24:58.418
JON: So I have to get what?

03:24:58.418 --> 03:25:02.549
TALIESIN: You're rolling with sleight of hand, so
add sleight of hand to whatever you roll.

03:25:02.549 --> 03:25:05.021
JON: 13 plus 11. 24.

03:25:05.021 --> 03:25:06.090
SAM: He beat it.

03:25:06.090 --> 03:25:08.588
MATT: You pocket a little shot.

03:25:08.588 --> 03:25:11.178
LAURA: Oh, shit, he beat my passive perception,
too!

03:25:11.178 --> 03:25:14.437
MATT: Yeah. Nobody sees it. Nobody sees it.

03:25:14.437 --> 03:25:16.044
TALIESIN: Well done.

03:25:16.044 --> 03:25:20.609
MARISHA: Hey, guys, does anyone have any shears?

03:25:20.609 --> 03:25:23.153
TALIESIN: Yes, and no.

03:25:23.153 --> 03:25:24.780
MARISHA: Shears?

03:25:24.780 --> 03:25:26.712
TALIESIN: I have them. You can't have them.

03:25:26.712 --> 03:25:28.794
MATT: So Percival walks past and approaches them.

03:25:28.794 --> 03:25:31.847
TALIESIN: They're bonding. He's a bit adorable.

03:25:31.847 --> 03:25:34.196
LAURA: Seems nice.

03:25:34.196 --> 03:25:35.440
LIAM: He's likable.

03:25:35.440 --> 03:25:39.818
TALIESIN: I am angry, frustrated, and violent, and
so I'm going to try something new and drink

03:25:39.818 --> 03:25:46.403
chocolate milk, and listen to you and do whatever
it is you think is best at this point. I don't

03:25:46.403 --> 03:25:51.914
know what to do. What do we do? What do I do?

03:25:51.914 --> 03:26:03.650
LAURA: I don't know what to do either, dear. I
think it's a matter of... Forgive.

03:26:03.650 --> 03:26:08.782
TALIESIN: Well, I'm not there yet, but I know I'm
feeling emotional, and I know that's when I need

03:26:08.782 --> 03:26:11.350
to shut up and listen to you.

03:26:11.350 --> 03:26:20.454
LAURA: Well, it's going to take time, I think. I'm
surprisingly okay with it.

03:26:20.454 --> 03:26:23.657
I'm just happy he's back.

03:26:23.657 --> 03:26:29.534
TALIESIN: I'm less not-okay than I thought I'd be.
I'm worried about Grog.

03:26:29.534 --> 03:26:32.337
LAURA: I'm very worried about him and Pike.

03:26:32.337 --> 03:26:37.499
TALIESIN: I'm very worried about Pike. I don't
know what to do.

03:26:37.499 --> 03:26:42.772
LIAM: Are they fist-fighting in the background?

03:26:42.772 --> 03:26:49.306
MARISHA: I go, hey guys, hey guys! Shears! And I
grab onto his plate armor and I cast Heat Metal.

03:26:49.306 --> 03:26:51.165
(sizzle)

03:26:51.165 --> 03:26:56.618
MATT: Your armor suddenly begins to turn bright
orange and burn your skin. (sizzle)

03:26:56.618 --> 03:26:59.742
JON: Oh! Okay, okay, that hurts, that hurts.

03:26:59.742 --> 03:27:03.354
MATT: How much damage does that do, Marisha?

03:27:03.354 --> 03:27:05.600
MARISHA: 2d8 damage.

03:27:05.600 --> 03:27:11.398
TALIESIN: Oh, that's going to hurt. And you get to
re-roll that one, don't you?

03:27:11.398 --> 03:27:16.213
MARISHA: Oh, I do. Elemental damage. Ooh, yeah.
Ten damage.

03:27:16.213 --> 03:27:18.602
LIAM: Fuck him up, babe!

03:27:18.602 --> 03:27:23.596
MATT: (sizzle) It sears into you, and you're like,
"Ooh, it burns! That's new! That's new!

03:27:23.596 --> 03:27:24.572
"That's new pain!"

03:27:24.572 --> 03:27:30.615
JON: I try to do a little bit of the Off a Duck's
Back.

03:27:30.615 --> 03:27:37.234
MATT: Yeah, so you go ahead and you take five
damage. You shrink into your armor. You try and

03:27:37.234 --> 03:27:38.856
minimize your torso.

03:27:38.856 --> 03:27:41.336
LIAM: He's turtling.

03:27:41.336 --> 03:27:47.574
TALIESIN: All right, one second. I'm going to
gently walk up behind them while this is happening

03:27:47.574 --> 03:27:50.599
and I'm going to Vulcan neck pinch him with the
Diplomacy.

03:27:50.599 --> 03:27:53.601
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.

03:27:53.601 --> 03:27:58.112
TALIESIN: That's... Where is that? There it is.

03:27:58.112 --> 03:28:02.127
JON: This is going to take a saving throw?

03:28:02.127 --> 03:28:08.436
TALIESIN: 21 to hit.

03:28:08.436 --> 03:28:11.725
JON: I have danger sense, so does that...?

03:28:11.725 --> 03:28:13.735
MATT: Yeah, so what's the save on that?

03:28:13.735 --> 03:28:15.490
JON: It just says I have advantage.

03:28:15.490 --> 03:28:17.535
MATT: On dexterity saving throws.

03:28:17.535 --> 03:28:19.656
JON: On dexterity saving throws. Is that a
dexterity?

03:28:19.656 --> 03:28:21.554
MATT: What's it say on Diplomacy?

03:28:21.554 --> 03:28:27.957
TALIESIN: It's a... I have to pull out the thing,
I didn't pull this together as much as I thought I

03:28:27.957 --> 03:28:33.001
should've. It's a constitution saving throw.

03:28:33.001 --> 03:28:35.541
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll a
constitution saving throw.

03:28:35.541 --> 03:28:42.511
TALIESIN: Which is a d20. I'm going to roll the
damage really quickly. Oh wow, this is a lot of

03:28:42.511 --> 03:28:46.219
damage. I apologize. 17 points of lightning
damage.

03:28:46.219 --> 03:28:48.892
MATT: So you take 17 points of lightning damage.

03:28:48.892 --> 03:28:56.839
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw now.

03:28:56.839 --> 03:28:58.169
JON: 20.

03:28:58.236 --> 03:29:00.818
TALIESIN: He saves. That's a natural 20. Oh well,
that didn't work.

03:29:00.818 --> 03:29:02.861
MATT: You feel this burst of electrical energy.

03:29:02.861 --> 03:29:04.906
TALIESIN: That was supposed to knock you out, and
now it didn't.

03:29:04.906 --> 03:29:11.287
JON: Yeah, and it's just like, ha, that tickled.
I'm going to go to bed, you guys. That was fun.

03:29:11.287 --> 03:29:13.840
Anybody else want to? No? Okay, I'm going.

03:29:13.840 --> 03:29:16.018
MATT: And Lionel just leaves.

03:29:16.018 --> 03:29:19.752
TALIESIN: This thing never works properly. I
really have to work on that.

03:29:19.752 --> 03:29:26.986
JON: That was a weak hit, by the way, if you were
trying to hit me. See you. Oh, wait, hold on. Are

03:29:26.986 --> 03:29:28.694
you going to drink this chocolate milk?

03:29:28.694 --> 03:29:30.536
TALIESIN: You can take it. You've earned it.

03:29:30.536 --> 03:29:32.073
JON: I'll take it.

03:29:32.073 --> 03:29:34.488
SAM: Just leaves the bar with the glass.

03:29:34.488 --> 03:29:36.859
TALIESIN: Another gold coin goes on the table.

03:29:36.859 --> 03:29:38.368
LIAM: I mean, would you stop it?

03:29:38.368 --> 03:29:39.538
TALIESIN: No.

03:29:39.538 --> 03:29:41.845
MATT: So the four of you now sit there in the
bar.

03:29:41.845 --> 03:29:44.540
LAURA: Five of us, Tary is there.

03:29:44.540 --> 03:29:46.680
MATT: Tary is there, that's right.

03:29:46.680 --> 03:29:48.930
SAM: He really would be good for the brigade.

03:29:48.930 --> 03:29:50.165
TALIESIN: I kind of like him.

03:29:50.165 --> 03:29:51.245
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

03:29:51.245 --> 03:29:54.252
TALIESIN: He's the sort of positive energy I think
your family's going to need around.

03:29:54.252 --> 03:29:56.668
SAM: Absolutely. I like him a lot.

03:29:56.668 --> 03:29:58.321
LAURA: Are you sure you can't stay?

03:29:58.321 --> 03:30:01.469
SAM: I'm staying for a little while. I have to
find Doty.

03:30:01.469 --> 03:30:03.671
TALIESIN: I understand.

03:30:03.671 --> 03:30:10.709
SAM: I have to find Doty and get some stuff, and
then I've got to be on my way.

03:30:10.709 --> 03:30:15.700
TALIESIN: By the way, what you said back there,
with your family, about me.

03:30:15.700 --> 03:30:16.712
SAM: Yes?

03:30:16.712 --> 03:30:18.300
TALIESIN: That was very flattering.

03:30:18.300 --> 03:30:21.417
SAM: Well, I know you're taken, and, you know.

03:30:21.417 --> 03:30:25.387
TALIESIN: Doesn't mean I can't be flattered. I'm
quite flattered. That was very flattering.

03:30:25.387 --> 03:30:27.709
SAM: I meant it.

03:30:27.709 --> 03:30:31.522
TALIESIN: And, you know, if things were different,
I would feel the same way.

03:30:31.522 --> 03:30:33.430
If things were very different.

03:30:33.430 --> 03:30:36.856
SAM: I get it. I get it. You're sort of making it
worse.

03:30:36.856 --> 03:30:38.759
TALIESIN: You're quite a catch. You're quite a
catch.

03:30:38.759 --> 03:30:41.815
LAURA: Can you stop flirting with each other?

03:30:41.815 --> 03:30:52.946
TALIESIN: I thought it might be fun. All right.
I'm going to gather up our things and prop up the

03:30:52.946 --> 03:30:58.918
table again and leave-- How much gold would be
appropriate for the damage and then some?

03:30:58.918 --> 03:31:06.045
MATT: The table isn't that expensive, to be
honest. Between the drinks you guys had, a solid

03:31:06.045 --> 03:31:07.756
seven or eight gold will handle it.

03:31:07.756 --> 03:31:15.266
TALIESIN: I'm going to leave ten gold and be like,
I'm so sorry, but try never not to make it worth

03:31:15.266 --> 03:31:17.483
your while and not be too horrible.

03:31:17.483 --> 03:31:25.239
MATT: "It's nice to know that the de Rolos are as
lively as the rest of the people who live here."

03:31:25.239 --> 03:31:29.581
TALIESIN: Thank you for running this
establishment. Have a good day.

03:31:29.581 --> 03:31:31.755
MATT: "You, too, my lord. My lady."

03:31:31.755 --> 03:31:37.451
TALIESIN: Let's go find the kids and see if we can
make them feel better.

03:31:37.451 --> 03:31:40.408
LAURA: I think they were going to bed, but we can
try.

03:31:40.408 --> 03:31:47.645
MARISHA: Keyleth throws her arm around Vax and
catches him up the whole way we walk. I really

03:31:47.645 --> 03:31:52.715
think you would really like Chode. He's super
nice, and he likes drinking chocolate milk...

03:31:52.715 --> 03:31:55.848
LIAM: I do, I like him already. He's instantly
likable.

03:31:55.848 --> 03:32:00.052
MARISHA: We got to talk a lot. We talked about his
background...

03:32:00.052 --> 03:32:01.884
LIAM: I was trying to...

03:32:01.884 --> 03:32:05.545
MARISHA: Yeah, gosh. Where were you?

03:32:05.545 --> 03:32:08.707
LIAM: I was trying to pitch him to Tary, but I
really like him. I want him to stay.

03:32:08.707 --> 03:32:11.809
SAM: No, this is all good. I love how you've all
fallen in love with Chod over here. It took you

03:32:11.809 --> 03:32:16.484
guys a full two weeks to even stomach me for a
day, but that's all right. It's fine.

03:32:16.484 --> 03:32:19.979
TALIESIN: We not asking him to join, while we were
thinking about having you join.

03:32:19.979 --> 03:32:22.772
SAM: No, he's great, though. We're instant love
with him.

03:32:22.772 --> 03:32:24.685
TALIESIN: He's not Vox Machina material, though.

03:32:24.685 --> 03:32:26.368
JON: Are you Taryon right now?

03:32:26.368 --> 03:32:30.980
LIAM: Hey, you know, I feel like we were about to
make our exit,

03:32:30.980 --> 03:32:33.076
but it's a little more complicated now, right?

03:32:33.076 --> 03:32:36.767
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:32:36.767 --> 03:32:38.448
LIAM: Might need to stay on a day or two.

03:32:38.448 --> 03:32:39.955
TALIESIN: Are we doing this thing?

03:32:39.955 --> 03:32:42.624
LAURA: Oh, we're definitely doing this. We're
going to Ank'harel.

03:32:42.624 --> 03:32:43.912
LIAM: I think we got to.

03:32:43.912 --> 03:32:51.100
MARISHA: The ziggurat's kind of a big deal, right?
I feel like that's warranted for extra Ashari

03:32:51.100 --> 03:32:55.402
leave time, for diplomatic duty. Right?

03:32:55.402 --> 03:32:57.076
TALIESIN: You said duty.

03:32:57.076 --> 03:32:58.828
MARISHA: I did say duty.

03:32:58.828 --> 03:33:01.696
TALIESIN: I know. I knew you would know. Never
change.

03:33:01.696 --> 03:33:06.298
MARISHA: I'll let Dad know he's going to have to
watch the tribe for a few more weeks.

03:33:06.298 --> 03:33:07.700
TALIESIN: I'll let Cass know.

03:33:07.700 --> 03:33:13.798
MARISHA: But one of these days I will have to be
getting back. Very soon.

03:33:13.798 --> 03:33:17.692
TALIESIN: Let's talk to Pike. Let's talk to Grog.
Let's see how they feel.

03:33:17.692 --> 03:33:20.755
LAURA: Pike? Grog? Did you put your earrings back
on?

03:33:20.755 --> 03:33:22.498
MATT: You hear nothing.

03:33:22.498 --> 03:33:24.706
LAURA: Scanlan.

03:33:24.706 --> 03:33:26.448
SAM: Yes?

03:33:26.448 --> 03:33:33.393
LAURA: I think they're really depressed, dear.

03:33:33.393 --> 03:33:37.237
TALIESIN: I think they're angry and sad.

03:33:37.237 --> 03:33:39.540
SAM: What? Percy?

03:33:39.540 --> 03:33:45.446
MARISHA: Oh, this is like a one-channel frequency.
We can all hear you.

03:33:45.446 --> 03:33:47.246
TALIESIN: Oh, is this a party line?

03:33:47.246 --> 03:33:49.154
MARISHA: Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

03:33:49.154 --> 03:33:52.193
LAURA: I'm just letting you know their earrings
are off. They can't hear us.

03:33:52.193 --> 03:33:54.136
TALIESIN: Or they're not talking.

03:33:54.136 --> 03:33:56.291
SAM: What should I do?

03:33:56.291 --> 03:33:58.154
LAURA: Say you're sorry.

03:33:58.154 --> 03:34:00.046
SAM: But they can't hear me.

03:34:00.046 --> 03:34:01.884
LAURA: Well, go fucking find them.

03:34:01.884 --> 03:34:05.998
MARISHA: Something like this is better done in
person,

03:34:05.998 --> 03:34:10.864
as opposed to over a communication device.

03:34:10.864 --> 03:34:15.368
SAM: I shouldn't text my apology?

03:34:15.368 --> 03:34:17.609
MARISHA: Nope, you should not.

03:34:17.609 --> 03:34:21.555
TALIESIN: Boy, there's a life lesson. D&amp;D
continued.

03:34:21.555 --> 03:34:24.896
LIAM: Don't use the Message spell to drop heavy
shit!

03:34:24.896 --> 03:34:27.792
TALIESIN: Eye contact, motherfuckers. Eye
contact.

03:34:27.792 --> 03:34:31.949
JON: Right then I walk into wherever he is,
right?

03:34:31.949 --> 03:34:33.489
MATT: Right, you go back to the tavern.

03:34:33.489 --> 03:34:40.641
JON: And I walk in. Hey. Boss. I got you the
bullets.

03:34:40.641 --> 03:34:42.238
SAM: You did?

03:34:42.238 --> 03:34:43.445
JON: Yeah.

03:34:43.445 --> 03:34:45.774
SAM: You are my best man!

03:34:45.774 --> 03:34:48.714
TALIESIN: I did give him a bag of musket shot.
It's okay. Carry on.

03:34:48.714 --> 03:34:53.766
JON: So, anyways. I'm going to go to bed now.

03:34:53.766 --> 03:34:55.094
SAM: Sure, sure.

03:34:55.094 --> 03:34:57.341
JON: It's nighttime, right?

03:34:57.341 --> 03:35:01.314
SAM: Yeah, no, it is. But did I buy him a room, or
is he just sort of...?

03:35:01.314 --> 03:35:03.086
JON: No, you don't have to buy me a room.

03:35:03.086 --> 03:35:04.590
MATT: You bought out the inn.

03:35:04.590 --> 03:35:07.060
JON: I'll just go sleep in the corner either way.

03:35:07.060 --> 03:35:11.332
SAM: Okay. Yeah. If anyone tries to kill me, kill
them.

03:35:11.332 --> 03:35:14.990
JON: Oh, yeah, I got it. I have danger sense.

03:35:14.990 --> 03:35:16.296
SAM: Oh, you do?

03:35:16.296 --> 03:35:21.195
JON: And the ducks will tell me if there's
anything wrong.

03:35:21.195 --> 03:35:24.383
SAM: The ducks. Yes, I know this about you.

03:35:24.383 --> 03:35:26.501
JON: I actually have Commune with Ducks.

03:35:26.501 --> 03:35:30.447
TALIESIN: He does actually have Commune with
Ducks. It is on the page.

03:35:30.447 --> 03:35:31.893
Staring at it right now.

03:35:31.893 --> 03:35:34.000
JON: You know what, I'm going to use it right
now.

03:35:34.000 --> 03:35:35.392
SAM: Do we have ducks near us?

03:35:35.392 --> 03:35:37.249
TALIESIN: There are ducks in Whitestone!

03:35:37.249 --> 03:35:39.989
MATT: In Whitestone, there's a lot more ducks in
this area than there are in Marquet.

03:35:39.989 --> 03:35:44.052
TALIESIN: There are ducks. We have ponds in the
local park. There's a small pond in the cemetery.

03:35:44.052 --> 03:35:47.402
JON: I forget I can do that wherever I go, and I
never get the chance.

03:35:47.402 --> 03:35:49.277
SAM: What are you going to ask them?

03:35:49.277 --> 03:35:53.256
JON: They can tell me up to three facts about the
land.

03:35:53.256 --> 03:35:58.458
TALIESIN: Yes, what do the ducks of Whitestone
say?

03:35:58.458 --> 03:36:00.238
MARISHA: What do the ducks say?

03:36:00.238 --> 03:36:02.055
TALIESIN: (quacking)

03:36:02.055 --> 03:36:07.029
MATT: As you take a moment and you kneel, and you
close your eyes, you envision the connection you

03:36:07.029 --> 03:36:14.440
had as a child to the ducks along the pond of the
oasis, and as you open your eyes again, you see

03:36:14.440 --> 03:36:20.872
there, waddling in through the doorway of the inn,
as the sun in the afternoon is going down to dusk,

03:36:20.872 --> 03:36:28.319
this one duck (quacking).

03:36:28.319 --> 03:36:34.262
JON: Hey, Brownie! What do you have to say about
this place?

03:36:34.262 --> 03:36:36.398
MATT: What do you want to ask it?

03:36:36.398 --> 03:36:38.278
JON: Oh, I have to ask.

03:36:38.278 --> 03:36:47.892
SAM: All I hear is quacking, right? He's just
quacking at the duck?

03:36:47.892 --> 03:36:49.936
MATT: You're just hearing quacking back and
forth.

03:36:49.936 --> 03:37:01.367
JON: Do we get bad weather here? Do you get bad
storms here?

03:37:01.367 --> 03:37:05.761
MATT: You hear through the duck's quacks, "It
rains quite often, actually.

03:37:05.761 --> 03:37:09.180
"It's pretty cloudy. Great."

03:37:09.180 --> 03:37:13.294
JON: Okay, so don't leave the hut without an
umbrella, okay?

03:37:13.294 --> 03:37:14.843
SAM: Okay, thank you.

03:37:14.843 --> 03:37:22.240
JON: And then, do we have to worry about-- Are
there any pyramids? Have you seen any pyramids

03:37:22.240 --> 03:37:23.941
around the place?

03:37:23.941 --> 03:37:26.279
MATT: The duck's head turns the other way, and it
says to you through quacks,

03:37:26.279 --> 03:37:29.347
"Actually, there's one below the city."

03:37:29.347 --> 03:37:32.331
TALIESIN: How do the ducks know that?

03:37:32.331 --> 03:37:33.848
LAURA: They wander everywhere.

03:37:33.848 --> 03:37:35.309
TALIESIN: How did they get down there?

03:37:35.309 --> 03:37:36.608
MATT: The essence of nature.

03:37:36.608 --> 03:37:39.096
MARISHA: The same reason why pigeons are in
Costco, okay?

03:37:39.096 --> 03:37:44.454
JON: He said there's another pyramid under the
city.

03:37:44.454 --> 03:37:46.323
SAM: The duck knew that?

03:37:46.323 --> 03:37:47.167
JON: Yeah!

03:37:47.167 --> 03:37:48.627
SAM: That is crazy.

03:37:48.627 --> 03:37:51.013
JON: Should we go?

03:37:51.013 --> 03:37:53.115
SAM: No, no, no.

03:37:53.115 --> 03:37:58.811
JON: Okay... Is there anything you need to know,
master?

03:37:58.811 --> 03:38:00.147
SAM: Yes.

03:38:00.147 --> 03:38:03.445
JON: About this area. It's pretty limited.

03:38:03.445 --> 03:38:05.815
SAM: Have Vox Machina been happy?

03:38:05.815 --> 03:38:13.891
JON: Ducks, do you know if that group over there,
have they been happy? Have they been happy?

03:38:13.891 --> 03:38:19.144
MATT: "They didn't look happy when they left the
tavern."

03:38:19.144 --> 03:38:31.336
JON: I think we all knew that you kind of wasted
that last one. It's okay, we did it. See you,

03:38:31.336 --> 03:38:33.036
Brownie! That was awesome!

03:38:33.036 --> 03:38:34.592
MATT: (flapping wings)

03:38:34.592 --> 03:38:38.994
JON: Can we go to another city sometime soon so I
can do that again?

03:38:38.994 --> 03:38:49.588
SAM: Yes, we will definitely do that. Absolutely.
Yeah. You need to use that skill more often. You

03:38:49.588 --> 03:38:52.589
know what the problem is, we don't have as many
ducks in Ank'harel.

03:38:52.589 --> 03:38:56.543
JON: I know. And most of the time I just find out
if it's going to rain or not.

03:38:56.543 --> 03:38:58.446
It's not that useful.

03:38:58.446 --> 03:38:59.842
SAM: You've been great this whole trip.

03:38:59.842 --> 03:39:00.744
JON: Thank you.

03:39:00.744 --> 03:39:05.147
SAM: I'll tell you what. I'm going to buy some
ducks, and just keep them back in Ank'harel for

03:39:05.147 --> 03:39:08.087
you. They can be your little birds.

03:39:08.087 --> 03:39:12.417
JON: I go to hug him, but then I forget that
he's... Is he still enchanted?

03:39:12.417 --> 03:39:13.754
SAM: No, I'm a little guy.

03:39:13.754 --> 03:39:17.015
JON: I squeeze him hard. A little too hard,
probably.

03:39:17.015 --> 03:39:18.487
SAM: Ow, ow.

03:39:18.487 --> 03:39:23.001
JON: All right, I'm going to go sleep in the
corner.

03:39:23.001 --> 03:39:24.382
SAM: Please do.

03:39:24.382 --> 03:39:28.569
MATT: Sleeps in the corner. All right. Scanlan,
are you doing anything?

03:39:28.569 --> 03:39:31.890
SAM: I mean, I was told to come apologize and find
them.

03:39:31.890 --> 03:39:33.674
TRAVIS: I was told...

03:39:33.674 --> 03:39:39.096
SAM: I'll go seek my friends out there in the
world.

03:39:39.096 --> 03:39:40.648
MATT: All right. Where do you go?

03:39:40.648 --> 03:39:45.130
SAM: Where am I going? Hello? It's me, Scanlan
Shorthalt.

03:39:45.130 --> 03:39:46.831
LAURA: Where do you want to go?

03:39:46.831 --> 03:39:49.151
SAM: I don't know, where is everybody?

03:39:49.151 --> 03:39:55.395
LAURA: Well. Pike and Grog went back to their
rooms.

03:39:55.395 --> 03:40:00.407
SAM: I don't want to disturb them. They're by
themselves, alone.

03:40:00.407 --> 03:40:01.897
Should I go knock on their doors?

03:40:01.897 --> 03:40:03.273
LAURA: It's up to you.

03:40:03.273 --> 03:40:09.860
SAM: Okay. I'll go find-- Do I know where they're
staying?

03:40:09.860 --> 03:40:13.748
MATT: You do. You've been to Whitestone Castle,
you know where the rooms are in the castle, it's

03:40:13.748 --> 03:40:14.915
just been a while.

03:40:14.915 --> 03:40:16.751
SAM: I'll go knock on Grog's door.

03:40:16.751 --> 03:40:18.320
JON: Do you need me for anything?

03:40:18.320 --> 03:40:19.481
SAM: No, you sleep it off.

03:40:19.481 --> 03:40:20.405
JON: Are you sure?

03:40:20.405 --> 03:40:22.052
SAM: Yeah, you've had too much chocolate milk.

03:40:22.052 --> 03:40:25.303
JON: Yeah, I am feeling a little bloated down
there.

03:40:25.303 --> 03:40:29.517
MATT: You make your way to the castle. You're let
in, because the guards still recognize you as a

03:40:29.517 --> 03:40:32.376
member of Vox Machina. Which room do you go to
first?

03:40:32.376 --> 03:40:33.357
SAM: Grog.

03:40:33.357 --> 03:40:35.063
MATT: Grog. Are you in your room?

03:40:35.063 --> 03:40:36.571
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

03:40:36.571 --> 03:40:37.908
MATT: (knocking)

03:40:37.908 --> 03:40:39.544
TRAVIS: Pike?

03:40:39.544 --> 03:40:58.208
SAM: It's me! Scan-man! Can I come in?

03:40:58.208 --> 03:41:00.397
I Dimension Door into the room.

03:41:00.397 --> 03:41:02.966
MATT: Scanlan (poof) appears in the center of your
chambers.

03:41:03.022 --> 03:41:11.139
SAM: You okay? You didn't come to the door. Big
fella.

03:41:11.139 --> 03:41:12.765
TRAVIS: I leave.

03:41:12.765 --> 03:41:16.848
SAM: I let him go.

03:41:16.848 --> 03:41:21.780
I take a shit on his bed -- no, I'm kidding.

03:41:21.780 --> 03:41:26.364
MATT: Grog leaves the chamber and exits.

03:41:26.364 --> 03:41:28.644
SAM: I'll walk over to Pike's room, then.

03:41:28.644 --> 03:41:30.041
MATT: Okay. Pike, are you in your room?

03:41:30.041 --> 03:41:31.361
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:41:31.361 --> 03:41:33.279
MATT: (knocking)

03:41:33.279 --> 03:41:35.761
SAM: Hello? It's me, Scan-man.

03:41:35.761 --> 03:41:40.711
ASHLEY: What do you want?

03:41:40.711 --> 03:41:44.558
SAM: Just to talk and say hello.

03:41:44.558 --> 03:41:47.313
ASHLEY: Oh, but we already said hello.

03:41:47.313 --> 03:41:58.889
SAM: Just to apologize again.

03:41:58.889 --> 03:42:05.948
ASHLEY: I'll open the door. Yes?

03:42:06.108 --> 03:42:18.559
SAM: Hey, listen. I know that we haven't seen each
other in a while, and we left on weird terms. And

03:42:18.559 --> 03:42:29.549
everything that's happened between us. But I want
you to know that I held no ill will towards you,

03:42:29.549 --> 03:42:45.665
and I thank you for agreeing to my request, a
while ago, to look after Kaylie if I should fall.

03:42:45.665 --> 03:42:53.814
And I'm glad it didn't come to that, but it's an
honor to know that

03:42:53.814 --> 03:42:56.159
you would have even considered it.

03:42:56.159 --> 03:43:06.500
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah.

03:43:06.572 --> 03:43:13.621
I slap him across the face.

03:43:13.621 --> 03:43:15.296
SAM: Sure, sure.

03:43:15.296 --> 03:43:17.259
MATT: (echoing slap)

03:43:17.259 --> 03:43:32.643
ASHLEY: Do you know... Do you remember what you
said, before you left? I mean, obviously you said

03:43:32.643 --> 03:43:39.045
lots of things. But there was one thing in
particular that's always bothered me.

03:43:39.045 --> 03:43:41.505
SAM: What?

03:43:41.505 --> 03:44:01.158
ASHLEY: You said that you were kept alive by some
weird fucking magic. And that's what I do. And I

03:44:01.158 --> 03:44:08.292
brought you back so you could be with your
daughter. So fuck you.

03:44:08.292 --> 03:44:13.442
SAM: Well, that was a cheap shot.

03:44:13.442 --> 03:44:22.444
ASHLEY: Sure. And you know what, I apologize for
putting you in my clothes, but the Scanlan that we

03:44:22.444 --> 03:44:29.115
know would've thought that was funny. I'm sorry I
didn't know your mother, but I imagine you don't

03:44:29.115 --> 03:44:31.041
know my mother's name.

03:44:31.041 --> 03:44:47.436
SAM: I don't. Pike, I don't have anything to say
in my defense. I was wrong, about the whole thing.

03:44:47.436 --> 03:44:58.446
I was not a good friend, and I was not a good
teammate. And I'll have to live with that. But I

03:44:58.446 --> 03:45:15.297
can tell you this. I like who I am now, and I
didn't then. So maybe, someday, we'll meet, and

03:45:15.297 --> 03:45:24.844
you'll get to know the new guy, but if it's not
meant to happen right now, that's okay, and I

03:45:24.844 --> 03:45:31.336
understand. And I will go back to what I was doing
before.

03:45:31.336 --> 03:45:33.929
ASHLEY: So you like who you are better without
us?

03:45:33.929 --> 03:45:47.629
SAM: No. No, that's not what I meant. I meant, I
like who I am now that I know my daughter, and I

03:45:47.629 --> 03:46:00.807
know that no matter what, I have someone out there
who's rooting for me. And no matter what happens,

03:46:00.807 --> 03:46:25.148
I've got that. And I... Yeah. That's it. I don't
like what I've been doing the last year in terms

03:46:25.148 --> 03:46:31.788
of, you know. I've been breaking the law a bit,
which I know you don't love.

03:46:31.788 --> 03:46:36.523
ASHLEY: I don't care what you do.

03:46:36.523 --> 03:46:47.625
SAM: But I'm doing things that I want to do for me
and my girl, and it's been rewarding and it's been

03:46:47.625 --> 03:46:58.797
fun, and that's all that matters at this point.
I'm comfortable with the bastard that I've been,

03:46:58.797 --> 03:47:11.730
because I know that the man I am now is different.
So I can't make everybody happy anymore, and I

03:47:11.730 --> 03:47:18.509
think that was my problem before. I was trying to
make everyone happy, and that's not my goal

03:47:18.509 --> 03:47:31.542
anymore. I'm sorry if I hurt you. I'm sorry how I
treated you when we first met, how I ogled you and

03:47:31.542 --> 03:47:41.782
flirted with you relentlessly. That was
disrespectful. But what I'm most sorry for is that

03:47:41.782 --> 03:47:49.016
you met me then, and not now. And that's all I can
say.

03:47:49.016 --> 03:47:57.842
ASHLEY: Well. Perhaps we'll meet again in
different circumstances.

03:47:57.842 --> 03:47:59.790
SAM: Okay.

03:47:59.790 --> 03:48:01.546
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:48:01.546 --> 03:48:03.131
SAM: Good night.

03:48:03.131 --> 03:48:04.619
ASHLEY: Good night.

03:48:04.619 --> 03:48:07.191
SAM: I'll leave.

03:48:07.191 --> 03:48:09.957
MATT: Okay. You make your way back.

03:48:09.957 --> 03:48:16.615
SAM: And I'll just phone Vex real quick and say,
hey, didn't work. I'm going to go back to

03:48:16.615 --> 03:48:17.750
Ank'harel now.

03:48:17.750 --> 03:48:19.230
LAURA: No, no, no, Scanlan.

03:48:19.230 --> 03:48:21.294
SAM: Yeah, it's not working, it's not great, so,
nope.

03:48:21.294 --> 03:48:22.819
LAURA: Scanlan, it takes time. Things take time.

03:48:22.819 --> 03:48:23.890
SAM: I'm sure it does.

03:48:23.890 --> 03:48:25.100
LAURA: Scanlan, where are you?

03:48:25.100 --> 03:48:27.609
SAM: I'm outside Pike's room, weirdly.

03:48:27.609 --> 03:48:32.057
LAURA: Shit. Stay there.

03:48:32.057 --> 03:48:35.318
SAM: I mean, I think she can hear me talking
through the door.

03:48:35.318 --> 03:48:37.619
LAURA: She can't, I don't think she's wearing the
earring. Unless she put it back in.

03:48:37.619 --> 03:48:40.095
SAM: No, no, no, I'm really outside her door,
talking.

03:48:40.095 --> 03:48:41.715
I'm sure she can hear me through the door.

03:48:41.715 --> 03:48:43.020
LAURA: Oh, seriously? Right there?

03:48:43.020 --> 03:48:44.547
SAM: Yeah. Yeah. Pike, can you hear me?

03:48:44.547 --> 03:48:47.139
ASHLEY: Yes, I can hear you.

03:48:47.139 --> 03:48:49.145
SAM: Yeah, she can totally hear everything.

03:48:49.145 --> 03:48:51.794
TALIESIN: This is an open channel. We can all
hear.

03:48:51.794 --> 03:48:53.412
MARISHA: Hi, Scanlan.

03:48:53.412 --> 03:48:56.404
SAM: Oh, hi! Hi, Keyleth.

03:48:56.404 --> 03:48:59.659
LIAM: Maybe you should just sleep on it before
leaving town, buddy.

03:48:59.659 --> 03:49:03.755
LAURA: Well, no, we're coming with you. You're not
just leaving us again.

03:49:03.755 --> 03:49:05.431
MARISHA: Again!

03:49:05.431 --> 03:49:07.011
LAURA: You just got here.

03:49:07.011 --> 03:49:10.362
LIAM: And some of us are happy to see you.

03:49:10.362 --> 03:49:13.194
TALIESIN: We're going to go see the pyramid.

03:49:13.194 --> 03:49:22.076
MARISHA: Yeah, you can go to Ank'harel, but we'll
be right behind you, I guess. We know who you are

03:49:22.076 --> 03:49:25.322
now, Aes... Agus...

03:49:25.322 --> 03:49:30.155
TALIESIN: Tary, are you in for one more adventure
before heading home?

03:49:30.155 --> 03:49:37.801
SAM: That would be a sweet close to it. I met you
in Ank'harel, didn't I?

03:49:37.801 --> 03:49:39.129
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:49:39.129 --> 03:49:41.861
SAM: I'm down.

03:49:41.861 --> 03:49:44.650
TALIESIN: Excellent.

03:49:44.650 --> 03:49:49.543
MARISHA: To Ank'harel in the morning, then.
Because I'm trying to sleep, you motherfuckers.

03:49:49.543 --> 03:49:53.657
TALIESIN: Take your earring off, put it on silent
if you ever want to fall asleep.

03:49:53.657 --> 03:49:57.949
MARISHA: The clasp is rusted from when we were in
the water plane, I can't take it off.

03:49:57.949 --> 03:49:59.757
TALIESIN: We take ours off, I'm taking mine off
now. Good night.

03:49:59.757 --> 03:50:01.279
LAURA: Okay, okay, shut up everyone.

03:50:01.279 --> 03:50:02.744
MARISHA: It's stuck there.

03:50:02.744 --> 03:50:12.464
MATT: All right. You all eventually find
yourselves to rest for the evening. Scanlan, you

03:50:12.464 --> 03:50:13.957
make your way back?

03:50:13.957 --> 03:50:20.404
SAM: I'm going to leave the little rock thing that
Grog gave me right outside his door, and I'll get

03:50:20.404 --> 03:50:26.847
Lionel up at first light, and I guess we'll set
off for Ank'harel.

03:50:26.847 --> 03:50:28.191
LAURA: No!

03:50:28.191 --> 03:50:31.235
MARISHA: We'll see him there.

03:50:31.235 --> 03:50:35.871
MATT: Okay. That's a two-week journey for you.

03:50:35.871 --> 03:50:38.597
SAM: I got no other way to get there.

03:50:38.597 --> 03:50:40.439
MARISHA: You could come with us.

03:50:40.439 --> 03:50:41.829
SAM: It was not offered.

03:50:41.829 --> 03:50:45.200
LAURA: Yes, you were, we didn't tell you to go!
Scanlan, we said don't go!

03:50:45.200 --> 03:50:48.872
SAM: Didn't you just say I will see you there?

03:50:48.872 --> 03:50:50.784
LAURA: No! Fucking Keyleth said that!

03:50:50.784 --> 03:50:54.133
MARISHA: I said if you run away we'll still find
you.

03:50:54.133 --> 03:50:55.662
ASHLEY: We'll still be right behind you.

03:50:55.662 --> 03:50:57.057
LAURA: We're not telling you to fucking go.

03:50:57.057 --> 03:50:58.729
SAM: Wait, so you want to travel with me?

03:50:58.729 --> 03:50:59.572
LAURA: Yes!

03:50:59.572 --> 03:51:01.115
SAM: Oh, okay, well, then I'll stick around.

03:51:01.115 --> 03:51:03.474
LIAM: All over the earring.

03:51:03.474 --> 03:51:07.829
TALIESIN: You know, I miss this drama. This is the
drama I missed. This is great.

03:51:07.829 --> 03:51:15.257
MATT: So we'll say at the next morning light, as
you all come to consciousness, you find there, spry

03:51:15.257 --> 03:51:25.522
and waiting in the center of town, one Scanlan
Shorthalt and one Lionel Gayheart, ready to join

03:51:25.522 --> 03:51:31.262
you on a trip back to Ank'harel. And that's where
we'll pick up next week.

03:51:31.262 --> 03:51:35.233
TRAVIS: Did you want to say something?

03:51:35.233 --> 03:51:36.081
ASHLEY: No.

03:51:36.081 --> 03:51:41.028
MATT: Is there something you wanted to do?
Something you wanted to button it on? Let's do it

03:51:41.028 --> 03:51:47.218
now. As you guys are gathering in the center of
the city, on your way to the Sun Tree, they stand

03:51:47.218 --> 03:51:52.548
there in the light. You guys have your equipment
on you, you're prepared for whatever may come on

03:51:52.548 --> 03:51:57.044
the other side of the world in the deserts of
Marquet, wherever this mountain may be.

03:51:57.044 --> 03:52:01.219
ASHLEY: Oh, you're still here.

03:52:01.219 --> 03:52:08.236
SAM: Yeah. You need me to find this thing, so I'll
lead you to it.

03:52:08.236 --> 03:52:16.116
ASHLEY: I throw him a bag of cookies. So we opened
a bakery while you were gone. We have these.

03:52:16.116 --> 03:52:20.382
They're called shorties. They're after you. So
hopefully you like them.

03:52:20.382 --> 03:52:22.892
TALIESIN: Much like you, they're a bit
disappointing.

03:52:22.892 --> 03:52:24.826
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:52:24.826 --> 03:52:30.723
SAM: I'll try-- Well, does it have any...

03:52:30.723 --> 03:52:34.932
JON: Cookies! (nom)

03:52:34.932 --> 03:52:38.727
MATT: And that's where we'll end the episode this
week.

03:52:38.727 --> 03:52:42.455
TALIESIN: Well fucking done, man! Well fucking
done!

03:52:42.455 --> 03:52:44.377
LAURA: Holy crap!

03:52:44.377 --> 03:52:46.972
MATT: Thank you so much for playing with us this
week! That was so much fun!

03:52:46.972 --> 03:52:48.755
MARISHA: Yay Chode!

03:52:48.893 --> 03:52:50.810
SAM: Chod?

03:52:50.810 --> 03:52:52.762
JON: She still can't get it right.

03:52:52.762 --> 03:52:56.116
MATT: By the way, I forgot earlier to mention that
PseudoSomething won the thing in the Twitch chat.

03:52:56.116 --> 03:53:00.013
Congratulations to you. Denoba will contact you if
they haven't already to get your information.

03:53:00.013 --> 03:53:01.799
LAURA: What was under the blanket the whole time?

03:53:01.799 --> 03:53:03.135
MATT: We'll have to wait 'til next week.

03:53:03.135 --> 03:53:07.038
TALIESIN: Next week is what's under the blanket.
That or cake.

03:53:07.038 --> 03:53:08.181
MATT: Possibly.

03:53:08.181 --> 03:53:09.686
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

03:53:09.686 --> 03:53:14.529
TALIESIN: Actually, I was about to say, because
he's not seen a proper battlemap, so maybe...

03:53:14.529 --> 03:53:20.081
MATT: I'll show him once you guys leave, but yeah.
Dude, thank you so much for coming and playing

03:53:20.081 --> 03:53:21.242
with us. Seriously.

03:53:21.242 --> 03:53:22.327
LAURA: That was so much fun.

03:53:22.327 --> 03:53:23.643
TALIESIN: That was amazing!

03:53:23.643 --> 03:53:25.184
MARISHA: Lionel!

03:53:25.184 --> 03:53:33.390
TALIESIN: Prepare for so much duck art. There's
just going to be... It's going to be like a 50's

03:53:33.390 --> 03:53:35.395
study. It's going to be so much.

03:53:35.395 --> 03:53:36.758
SAM: Ducks everywhere.

03:53:36.758 --> 03:53:38.313
MATT: I love it.

03:53:38.313 --> 03:53:39.699
TALIESIN: Mallard art.

03:53:39.699 --> 03:53:44.424
LAURA: Oh my God, next week's our 100th episode!
How fucking weird is it

03:53:44.424 --> 03:53:48.524
that we got the T-shirts released...

03:53:48.524 --> 03:53:52.918
MATT: Oh, dude. The minute that you showed that
the T-shirts had shown up to everyone in the store

03:53:52.918 --> 03:53:56.077
tonight, me and Sam were like...

03:53:56.077 --> 03:53:59.945
MARISHA: Like, if people didn't think we had a
writer's room before, they definitely are now!

03:53:59.945 --> 03:54:03.213
This feels like a marketing campaign!

03:54:03.213 --> 03:54:08.440
TALIESIN: I didn't know about the shirts until we
showed up. That's just been in process.

03:54:08.440 --> 03:54:12.571
LAURA: Yeah, we've just been working on this shirt
for a while. And it came out this week.

03:54:12.571 --> 03:54:14.195
TRAVIS: We didn't plan that in any way.

03:54:14.195 --> 03:54:17.170
ASHLEY: Serendipitous.

03:54:17.170 --> 03:54:23.127
MATT: It's kind of amazing. But anyway, guys,
we're going to go because some of us have flights

03:54:23.127 --> 03:54:28.099
in the morning to go the Stream of Annihilation
tomorrow and Saturday at D&amp;D. Big round of

03:54:28.099 --> 03:54:29.763
applause for Jon Heder.

03:54:29.763 --> 03:54:32.672
(cheering)

03:54:32.672 --> 03:54:39.118
MATT: That's for you, that's for you. Have a
wonderful night, guys. Rest well. And is it

03:54:39.118 --> 03:54:42.007
Thursday yet? Good night!

03:54:42.007 --> 04:01:28.351
