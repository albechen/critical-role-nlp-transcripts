00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.999
MARISHA: And I cast my Skywrite spell-- ew, I just
spit-- and I use the smoke in the distance and as

00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:16.309
it's rising up into the sky, start drawing out the
de Rolo family crest in the smoke.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.645
MATT: Okay. You begin to take the plume of smoke
and filter into the dark rain clouds and you make

00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:28.295
the smoke go to a thicker, thicker black and take
the next few moments to begin sculpting in the air

00:00:28.338 --> 00:00:32.750
until eventually we have a very well-defined de
Rolo crest now staring down at the entire city of

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.008
Whitestone.

00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:37.293
SAM: Oh! Something's happening! Something's
happening in the sky!

00:00:37.293 --> 00:00:38.700
MARISHA: That's me.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.252
SAM: I think it's a magic wielder of some sort.
Something-- I must flee!

00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:46.311
(laughter)

00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:53.239
MATT: All right. Investigation checks from both of
you.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.071
LAURA: Okay.

00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:57.349
TRAVIS: Did I find anything on Smash-Face?

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:59.510
LIAM: (sighs) That's what you rolled the last
time.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.523
LAURA: I know!

00:01:00.523 --> 00:01:01.719
TALIESIN: 16.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.194
LAURA: I've got to put this one away for a while.

00:01:03.194 --> 00:01:04.329
MATT: What did you roll?

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:06.680
LAURA: I rolled a nine.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.059
MATT: Okay. The two of you take a while upstairs
looking about the rooms. You manage to acquire

00:01:13.128 --> 00:01:20.877
from just some of the local bits of cabinets and
dust, you gather about 230 gold pieces.

00:01:20.877 --> 00:01:22.292
LAURA: 230?

00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:27.191
MATT: Just loose gold pieces that are around.
There is a nice jewelry box that seems to contain

00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:31.314
most of the jewels and gems that this individual
likes.

00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:33.430
LAURA: I'm going to take the whole jewelry box and
sort through it later.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.539
MATT: Okay. So say a box of Tylieri's jewelry
would be what you've marked down.

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.349
TALIESIN: Tylieri family jewels.

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:42.113
(laughter)

00:01:42.113 --> 00:01:43.431
TALIESIN: That won't be confusing at all.

00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:46.716
MATT: There you go. You do notice, however, that's
all you're able to find for the most part, other than

00:01:46.716 --> 00:01:51.111
some few bits of clothing and outfit. The master
bedroom has no bed.

00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:54.477
LAURA: Does he sleep in a coffin?

00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:58.175
TALIESIN: We're going to finish searching
downstairs and then find the entrance to the--

00:01:58.175 --> 00:01:59.475
MATT: Okay.

00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:02.712
LIAM: I'd like to wind my way up there, as well.

00:02:02.712 --> 00:02:05.390
MATT: Okay, as you make your way up there you
notice them stepping out.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.316
LIAM: Yeah. I'm still curious. I want to go have a
look as well.

00:02:08.316 --> 00:02:09.986
MATT: Go for it. Investigation.

00:02:09.986 --> 00:02:11.477
LAURA: That's better, thank you.

00:02:11.477 --> 00:02:13.307
LIAM: 16.

00:02:13.307 --> 00:02:17.779
MATT: 16? You look through the room. Most
everything of interest has already been picked

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:24.586
clean. This room also doesn't seem to see much use
other than the clothing that's in there. This room

00:02:24.586 --> 00:02:28.202
is used for dressing and presentational purposes
but other than that, as a bedroom, it's pretty

00:02:28.202 --> 00:02:34.957
useless. As you guys go downstairs, we'll say for
the sake of brevity you take a little bit of time

00:02:34.957 --> 00:02:38.249
to start looking through. You know you're a little
pressed for time because you can feel the energy

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.176
in the town begin to rise and you start hearing
noises. You keeping an eye out?

00:02:41.176 --> 00:02:42.148
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:02:42.148 --> 00:02:44.728
MATT: The people that rush into the rooms are now
rushing back out, some of them wearing leather

00:02:44.728 --> 00:02:49.317
tunics and small bits of armor, their weapons
gathered, and they're forming small bands.

00:02:49.317 --> 00:02:54.808
MARISHA: I come over the speakers once again, the
ear pieces. "I think it's time to go. Whenever you

00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:57.007
"guys are ready, I want to light this bitch up."

00:02:57.007 --> 00:02:59.452
TRAVIS: We need to check all the rooms that go
downstairs first.

00:02:59.452 --> 00:03:00.750
MARISHA: All right, quick.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.756
TRAVIS: "Got an empty house." I run out to the
door to the left. To the uncovered areas.

00:03:05.756 --> 00:03:10.710
MATT: Okay. You go over to this hallway. You
eventually smash the door, doesn't take too long.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:19.657
It leads into what looks like a small study or
some sort of an office room. A big blue rug, a

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:22.318
desk with a chair, some papers strewn about.

00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:24.772
TRAVIS: Can I grab the rug and yank it?

00:03:24.772 --> 00:03:27.239
MATT: Yeah, pull the rug off, reveals a hatch.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.421
TRAVIS: (excited shouting) I found a hatch!

00:03:29.421 --> 00:03:32.540
LAURA: (cries out in pain) No need to yell!

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.628
TRAVIS: Oh sorry. (quieter) I found a hatch.

00:03:34.628 --> 00:03:38.690
TALIESIN: Quick, I just want to do a quick round
of the downstairs room before going to the hatch.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.490
MATT: Okay. Glancing about, you find what looks to
be a general sitting area, a music room, or a

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.769
place where you would host guests. Also in fair disuse.
And then beyond that, you find a room that's

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.494
pretty bland, with a staircase that leads down
into what was once servants' quarters that has

00:03:55.494 --> 00:03:57.209
been converted into a torture room.

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.649
LAURA: Oh, lovely.

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:04.368
MATT: It's a little nicer in its presentation and
tools than the duergar torture room that you

00:04:04.368 --> 00:04:10.348
encountered in the Underdark, but this looks to be
like Tylieri had a definite interest in

00:04:10.348 --> 00:04:14.970
entertaining unwanted guests.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.685
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:20.499
TRAVIS: Vax or Vex, will you come check this hatch
for boobies?

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:22.438
(laughter)

00:04:22.438 --> 00:04:24.236
LIAM: I jog on down.

00:04:24.236 --> 00:04:26.549
MATT: All right, make a perception check.

00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:30.079
LIAM: Yeah. That's a 23.

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:32.179
MATT: Yeah, it does not appear to be trapped.

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:33.449
TRAVIS: No boobies.

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.317
LIAM: Okay. You want to open that, big guy?

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:37.701
TRAVIS: Yeah! (growls)

00:04:37.753 --> 00:04:44.923
MATT: (vroom) The hatch comes up. There is no
ladder; it's just a ten-foot drop down into a

00:04:44.923 --> 00:04:45.879
basement.

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:47.242
TRAVIS: Okay, I jump.

00:04:47.242 --> 00:04:52.750
MATT: Land down there. A 20 foot by 20 foot room.
It's very musty. However, you do see in the far

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.718
corner there is a pad of fresh earth set up, and
there is a dark box.

00:04:57.718 --> 00:04:59.414
TRAVIS: Um.

00:04:59.414 --> 00:05:00.653
MATT: About eight feet long.

00:05:00.653 --> 00:05:04.090
LIAM: I hear him say "Um," and I jump down, too.
With the Flametongue dagger out for light.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.456
MATT: Okay. The room lights up a little bit and
you can see across the way there is a not

00:05:08.504 --> 00:05:12.255
super-detailed, but a fairly well-crafted coffin
on the opposite side of the room.

00:05:12.255 --> 00:05:16.196
TRAVIS: Ooh! I bet there's treasure in there!

00:05:16.196 --> 00:05:19.243
LIAM: You might be right. Yeah, let's go have a
look.

00:05:19.303 --> 00:05:21.028
LAURA: Is there treasure? Did you find treasure?

00:05:21.028 --> 00:05:27.407
LIAM: "Hold, please." Perception check the coffin.
That's a 20.

00:05:27.407 --> 00:05:32.249
MATT: Okay. The coffin does not appear to be
trapped?

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:34.186
TRAVIS: Can I open it?

00:05:34.186 --> 00:05:35.924
MARISHA: He said that with a question mark.

00:05:35.924 --> 00:05:37.645
MATT: It's always fun to do that.

00:05:37.645 --> 00:05:41.659
TRAVIS: Well, should I just smash it?

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.984
LIAM: I really feel like this could be--

00:05:43.984 --> 00:05:45.261
LAURA: Smash it!

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:50.549
TRAVIS: Three, two. Grog smashes.

00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:53.908
LIAM: I kick it off with the end of my foot.
Little bit. Or try to.

00:05:53.908 --> 00:06:00.116
MATT: Okay. (boof) The lid flies off and then
slams on the ground. A smell hits you that's just

00:06:00.116 --> 00:06:08.678
like musty old mildewed earth. The inside of the
coffin is, it's lined with like a fine purplish

00:06:08.678 --> 00:06:13.748
velvet material, the smell quickly fades. It looks
like there are some small baubles in there,

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:22.248
keepsakes. There is what looks to be a cape or a
cloak that is laid across the bottom of this for

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:24.061
comfort.

00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:28.729
LIAM: Roll it up. Put it into my satchel. I'm
going to take a dagger out and I want to cut all

00:06:28.814 --> 00:06:32.428
the way up through that purple velvet. Just see,
just in case.

00:06:32.428 --> 00:06:36.840
MATT: Okay. You cut through the purple velvet.
Rummage through underneath. It appears to be the

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.169
back of the box.

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:41.723
TALIESIN: I'm going to check his desk upstairs for
anything interesting.

00:06:41.723 --> 00:06:45.339
MATT: Okay. Want to make an investigation check?

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:47.958
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:56.119
MATT: As you're rummaging through the notes in the
desk, a lot of them are ledgers involving the

00:06:56.119 --> 00:07:00.058
trade in and out of the city. He has his hands
dabbling in elements of the timber trade, elements

00:07:00.058 --> 00:07:08.135
of the actual trade of whitestone. He talks about
the-- and you understand, the reason that

00:07:08.135 --> 00:07:13.735
Whitestone itself is-- the stone that's mined here
is so popular for construction and architecture

00:07:13.735 --> 00:07:22.295
and other elements is the stone that these
mountains are made of, when properly prepared,

00:07:22.295 --> 00:07:28.851
there is a faint bit of residuum that is naturally
ingrained in the rock here. No one really knows

00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:33.972
how it came about, but whatever it is, while it is
not inherently magical, it makes it a little bit

00:07:33.972 --> 00:07:38.876
easier, faster, and cheaper to enchant the stone.
So when it comes to, you know, enchanting a

00:07:38.876 --> 00:07:46.172
teleportation circle permanently somewhere or for
traps or things-- not actual objects but actually

00:07:46.212 --> 00:07:52.081
enchanting anything made of stonework. It's easier
to enchant, and that's why the whitestone of this

00:07:52.081 --> 00:07:58.182
area is sought after and a good trade element. So
there's notes about that. But the stone trade has

00:07:58.182 --> 00:08:03.271
been halted, all stone has continued to be mined,
but it's not being transported.

00:08:03.271 --> 00:08:06.022
TRAVIS: Is the desk made out of the stone?

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:12.451
MATT: No, there's just notes about it. So all the
whitestone that is being mined is not being

00:08:12.451 --> 00:08:14.731
exported. It's being kept here, somewhere.

00:08:14.731 --> 00:08:15.887
LAURA: They're making something big.

00:08:15.887 --> 00:08:17.149
TALIESIN: They're making something big.

00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:19.562
LIAM: I think we need to get out of here.

00:08:19.562 --> 00:08:21.969
TRAVIS: I was going to ask, are you good with the
coffin?

00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:24.321
LIAM: Yeah.

00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:27.842
TRAVIS: Okay. I smash the shit out of it, in an
effort to see what's underneath.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:33.746
MATT: Okay. You take about 30 seconds of extreme
violence against the wooden coffin, killing it

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:39.347
into chunks and blocks. You get the feeling that
this may have been the place the mist was

00:08:39.347 --> 00:08:50.111
trying to get to. But it did not make its journey.
It got scattered by druid Sunbeam and destroyed,

00:08:50.165 --> 00:08:56.452
and the coffin is left in ruins. You do-- even you,
Grog-- absorb the fact that when a vampire goes to

00:08:56.452 --> 00:09:01.232
mist form, you get the feeling that this is the
home it needs to come to, to try and survive.

00:09:01.322 --> 00:09:03.123
TRAVIS: Not anymore.

00:09:03.123 --> 00:09:04.902
MATT: Not anymore. Not that one.

00:09:04.902 --> 00:09:07.775
MARISHA: Do I see anyone coming?

00:09:07.775 --> 00:09:13.371
MATT: Oh. You see another zombie giant coming up
the way. You can see people attacking it, it's

00:09:13.371 --> 00:09:16.849
just thrashing them about, but this one seems less
bothered by the group and is now moving towards a

00:09:16.849 --> 00:09:21.921
specific area, moving towards the fiery plume
in the distance. They're all gathering in that

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:22.876
direction.

00:09:22.876 --> 00:09:24.430
MARISHA: But no one seems to be rushing towards
this house?

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.446
MATT: Not at the moment, no.

00:09:25.446 --> 00:09:27.047
TRAVIS: This one's not on fire. Yet.

00:09:27.047 --> 00:09:34.228
MATT: All right, you all gather, you can hear the
rainstorm itself is coming down in sheets. What

00:09:34.263 --> 00:09:35.467
do you want to do?

00:09:35.467 --> 00:09:36.861
TRAVIS: Light this candle!

00:09:36.861 --> 00:09:38.599
LAURA: Should we light this on fire, too?

00:09:38.599 --> 00:09:40.224
TALIESIN: Burn it to the ground.

00:09:40.224 --> 00:09:44.394
MARISHA: "Everyone out." And I start casting a
Flaming Sphere.

00:09:44.394 --> 00:09:45.635
MATT: Okay.

00:09:45.635 --> 00:09:46.876
TRAVIS: We're out by now.

00:09:46.876 --> 00:09:48.002
MARISHA: Everyone out.

00:09:48.002 --> 00:09:51.765
MATT: You guys all step out into the rain
(whooshes) pouring down. What bits of guard blood

00:09:51.765 --> 00:09:53.965
that have been pressed against you washes off.

00:09:53.965 --> 00:09:55.174
TRAVIS: Aw.

00:09:55.174 --> 00:10:01.784
MARISHA: I peek in this foyer. And just (boof),
right in the middle, and take a minute to

00:10:01.784 --> 00:10:03.710
move it all around.

00:10:03.767 --> 00:10:07.643
MATT: A Flaming Sphere begins to corkscrew around
this room, up over the banister, up to the upper

00:10:07.643 --> 00:10:13.227
area, and like an artist, you paint this entire
room with flame until the entire interior of this

00:10:13.227 --> 00:10:18.664
main foyer is just an inferno. You can hear the
flames licking and the light is very bright. You

00:10:18.664 --> 00:10:24.172
end up backing up and you can see people,
unarmored folk in nearby homes that are pressed up

00:10:24.172 --> 00:10:28.851
against their windows watching this happen and
whispering to each other. The children, those that

00:10:28.851 --> 00:10:33.065
are kept guarded and are not part of this
rebellion, they are watching this with smiles.

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:38.084
MARISHA: Okay, I think that's good enough.
Let's go.

00:10:38.148 --> 00:10:40.109
TALIESIN: Head back to the curiosity shop.

00:10:40.109 --> 00:10:42.204
LAURA: Yeah, sneaky, stealthing.

00:10:42.204 --> 00:10:44.647
MATT: Okay. As you guys run off into the alley
behind--

00:10:44.647 --> 00:10:46.474
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace I cast on all of us.

00:10:46.474 --> 00:10:50.665
MATT: Okay. How many more spells do you have at
that level? Because you used it several times

00:10:50.665 --> 00:10:51.594
today.

00:10:51.594 --> 00:10:55.286
LAURA: Yeah, I'm fine with Pass Without a Trace.
That's a 1st-level. 2nd-level, but I'm fine.

00:10:55.286 --> 00:10:56.736
TALIESIN: Back to the alcove, then?

00:10:56.736 --> 00:11:02.035
MATT: You guys all dart off into the alley under
the cover of the shadows of the storm and the

00:11:02.035 --> 00:11:05.004
rainfall, to head towards the alcove, and we'll go
ahead and take a quick break.

00:11:05.004 --> 00:11:06.535
(cheering)

00:11:06.535 --> 00:11:08.982
MATT: A quick break, I know I always say that, I'm
not going to say five minutes, but.

00:11:08.982 --> 00:11:10.218
SAM: This one's a real quick break.

00:11:10.218 --> 00:11:11.745
MATT: We'll take it real quick because we want to
try and get through as much of the story before we

00:11:11.745 --> 00:11:13.293
get to Critmas.

00:11:13.293 --> 00:11:14.215
LAURA: Critmas!

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.245
LIAM: Critmas! Crimmas.

00:11:15.245 --> 00:11:16.246
TALIESIN: Oh dear god.

00:11:16.246 --> 00:11:17.116
TRAVIS: It's going to be a thing.

00:11:17.116 --> 00:11:18.293
MATT: Which is going to, which is going to take
some time tonight. Be back here in a few minutes

00:11:18.293 --> 00:11:19.275
guys, we'll see you in a sec.

00:11:19.275 --> 00:11:20.046
TRAVIS: Pizza!

00:11:20.046 --> 00:25:30.878
[break]

00:25:30.926 --> 00:25:36.732
MATT: Welcome back. So. Jumping back into the
chaos, the party has scattered back into the

00:25:36.732 --> 00:25:42.191
rainstorm. I would like everyone to make a stealth
check.

00:25:42.191 --> 00:25:43.853
LAURA: Oh, right. Plus ten for everybody.

00:25:43.853 --> 00:25:45.340
MATT: Plus ten.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.657
LIAM: I did all right.

00:25:48.657 --> 00:25:52.547
TALIESIN: I rolled my disadvantage.

00:25:52.547 --> 00:25:54.819
TRAVIS: Does it matter on a one?

00:25:54.819 --> 00:25:57.180
MATT: All right.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.554
TRAVIS: Ten?

00:25:59.554 --> 00:26:00.950
MATT: Total ten?

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:02.946
TRAVIS: Total ten. 11.

00:26:02.946 --> 00:26:04.596
LAURA: 11, technically.

00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:05.841
MATT: Okay.

00:26:05.841 --> 00:26:07.120
LAURA: 29.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.378
LIAM: 43.

00:26:08.378 --> 00:26:10.542
SAM: I'm not there.

00:26:10.542 --> 00:26:12.252
TRAVIS: 43?

00:26:12.252 --> 00:26:18.001
MATT: Well, you're making your own stealth,
though. You're invisible, so just roll twice.

00:26:18.001 --> 00:26:19.271
SAM: Natural 20.

00:26:19.271 --> 00:26:20.772
MARISHA: 28.

00:26:20.772 --> 00:26:22.102
TALIESIN: 30.

00:26:22.102 --> 00:26:28.743
MATT: Okay. So making up for the bounding chaos
that is Grog throughout the city, you manage to

00:26:28.743 --> 00:26:34.893
still make your way largely as a group stealthed
to-- are you heading to the alcove, you said?

00:26:34.964 --> 00:26:38.620
TALIESIN: That's where we had our little
crash-base set up, right?

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:46.901
MATT: Correct. All right. You make your way to the
alcove. As you're darting through, you can see in

00:26:46.901 --> 00:26:54.472
the distance small pocketed sounds of yells and
the occasional sound of some sort of large-scale

00:26:54.472 --> 00:27:00.493
crumbling or crashing of wood and stone.
Occasionally, darting past the streets, you see

00:27:00.493 --> 00:27:10.872
militant occupants of Whitestone: armored, rushing
through, shouting orders to each other, some

00:27:10.872 --> 00:27:17.013
coming back wounded and helping their friends
back. The midday rebellion has definitely started,

00:27:17.013 --> 00:27:22.583
and you get the sense that the initial surprise
has been effective, but the longer this runs, the

00:27:22.583 --> 00:27:28.558
longer this wears on, the more and more of a body
count this will be.

00:27:28.558 --> 00:27:33.766
TRAVIS: Seeing the chaos, can I get the Dust of
Tracelessness and start trying to sprinkle it

00:27:33.766 --> 00:27:34.674
behind us?

00:27:34.674 --> 00:27:35.943
MATT: Yeah.

00:27:35.943 --> 00:27:37.669
MARISHA: Guys, we should do something.

00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:39.034
LAURA: I know, we really should.

00:27:39.034 --> 00:27:40.703
SAM: Am I with these guys yet?

00:27:40.703 --> 00:27:47.106
MATT: You have not, but you all meet up back at
the alcove, communicating over your earpieces. You

00:27:47.106 --> 00:27:50.947
make your way to the front of the building. The
doors are closed and locked.

00:27:50.947 --> 00:27:53.642
LIAM: The alcove?

00:27:53.642 --> 00:27:55.822
TRAVIS: Closed and locked?

00:27:55.822 --> 00:27:59.311
LIAM: I'll see about that. I'm going to check the
door.

00:27:59.311 --> 00:28:00.884
MATT: Go for it.

00:28:00.884 --> 00:28:05.204
LIAM: That is ten. 23.

00:28:05.204 --> 00:28:07.924
MATT: Okay. Seems to be a fairly simple lock.

00:28:07.924 --> 00:28:09.029
LIAM: All right.

00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:10.948
TRAVIS: Look for an ambush around. Can we look
around?

00:28:10.948 --> 00:28:12.288
LAURA: Yeah, perceive it?

00:28:12.288 --> 00:28:13.988
TRAVIS: Rooftops? Sides of the building?

00:28:13.988 --> 00:28:15.553
MATT: Make a perception check, guys.

00:28:15.553 --> 00:28:16.804
MARISHA: All of us?

00:28:16.804 --> 00:28:19.352
SAM: Me too?

00:28:19.352 --> 00:28:21.658
MATT: Not you, you haven't gotten there yet.

00:28:21.658 --> 00:28:23.427
LIAM: 20.

00:28:23.427 --> 00:28:24.853
TRAVIS: I actually rolled a 17.

00:28:24.853 --> 00:28:25.873
MARISHA: 12.

00:28:25.873 --> 00:28:26.874
TALIESIN: 24.

00:28:26.874 --> 00:28:27.781
LAURA: 26.

00:28:27.781 --> 00:28:34.803
MATT: Okay. Looking about, there doesn't appear to
be any set ambush or anybody else here. You do

00:28:34.803 --> 00:28:39.405
hear the soft sound of pacing footsteps in the
interior.

00:28:39.405 --> 00:28:43.606
LAURA: Should we knock on the door?

00:28:43.606 --> 00:28:45.014
TRAVIS: Canvass the building.

00:28:45.014 --> 00:28:51.179
LIAM: I can get in there and see who that is. I
can go in, yeah.

00:28:51.287 --> 00:28:53.735
LAURA: They're right on the inside.

00:28:53.735 --> 00:28:56.827
LIAM: I thought it was upstairs, or you said right
on the other side of the door?

00:28:56.827 --> 00:28:58.538
LAURA: Right on the other side of the door.

00:28:58.538 --> 00:29:05.194
MARISHA: Oh, for crying out loud. I push past
them I just go, Jordana! Jordana, it's us!

00:29:05.294 --> 00:29:10.074
MATT: Okay, there's a pause and a voice goes,
"Who's us?"

00:29:10.074 --> 00:29:12.640
LAURA: Oh. Crazy grandma!

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.724
MARISHA: And Vox Machina. (quietly) Does she know
we're called that?

00:29:16.724 --> 00:29:20.487
LAURA: No. I don't know. (louder) Crazy grandma
was staying with you. Crazy peasants.

00:29:20.487 --> 00:29:21.888
MARISHA: Allies.

00:29:21.888 --> 00:29:23.615
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:29:23.615 --> 00:29:28.179
MARISHA: Son of a-- nine?

00:29:28.179 --> 00:29:29.832
LAURA: Can I help?

00:29:29.832 --> 00:29:31.986
LAURA AND MARISHA: Crazy grandma!

00:29:31.986 --> 00:29:33.774
MARISHA: Crazy grandma can help!

00:29:33.774 --> 00:29:37.073
MATT: I'll say since you're backing her failure
up, go ahead and make it with disadvantage.

00:29:37.073 --> 00:29:41.781
MARISHA: Hey, you don't have to call it-- that
sounds so sad when you say it like that.

00:29:41.781 --> 00:29:45.006
LAURA: 18.

00:29:45.006 --> 00:29:54.434
MATT: 18. There's a pause. "Crazy grandma? Come
in." You hear the sound of a locking sound and the

00:29:54.434 --> 00:30:00.482
door opens up ever-so-slightly. A very, very dimly
lit interior, there's a small lantern, a hooded

00:30:00.482 --> 00:30:03.790
lantern across the room. Other than that, you see
the shadow of Jordana as she ushers you all in out

00:30:03.843 --> 00:30:05.065
of the rain.

00:30:05.065 --> 00:30:08.785
LAURA: So, hey guess what? It's started.

00:30:08.785 --> 00:30:15.211
MATT: "Yeah, apparently." She closes the door
behind you, looks out the window that has the

00:30:15.211 --> 00:30:22.975
curtains closed and goes, "Okay. So. It's
underway. It's not safe to be here right now."

00:30:22.975 --> 00:30:24.105
LAURA: No.

00:30:24.105 --> 00:30:26.164
MATT: "Did anyone see you come in?"

00:30:26.164 --> 00:30:27.669
LAURA: No, no.

00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:32.872
MATT: "Good. Who are you?"

00:30:32.872 --> 00:30:39.973
LAURA: "Oh. Well." How about Seeming? This whole
time, have we looked like

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.492
crazy peasants during the battle?

00:30:41.492 --> 00:30:42.388
MATT and TRAVIS: No.

00:30:42.388 --> 00:30:43.290
TRAVIS: We dropped it.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:44.142
LAURA: We dropped it?

00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:45.260
MATT: You dropped Seeming before all of this.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.658
LAURA: Okay, just making sure Trinket wasn't a
donkey that killed the--

00:30:47.658 --> 00:30:48.488
MATT: No.

00:30:48.488 --> 00:30:50.057
TALIESIN: That would've been intense and awesome.

00:30:50.057 --> 00:30:52.176
MATT: That would've been amazing. Donkey eating a
vampire head? Aw, man.

00:30:52.176 --> 00:30:57.824
LIAM: This is hard to believe, but this is crazy
grandma.

00:30:57.824 --> 00:31:02.586
LAURA: "I'm crazy grandma." I do a crazy eye thing
just to show her.

00:31:02.586 --> 00:31:05.620
SAM: Am I there, Matt?

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:09.586
MATT: You've just now gotten to that point, you
see the door closing as you get there.

00:31:09.586 --> 00:31:13.895
SAM: Hello. Hi. How'd it go?

00:31:13.895 --> 00:31:18.890
MARISHA: Good work, by the way! That was awesome!
I mean, I saw the fire, I don't know what you did.

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:20.978
LAURA: So it went well?

00:31:21.034 --> 00:31:27.345
SAM: I set fire to the place, some shit went down,
dinosaurs were harmed, but I know you got the

00:31:27.345 --> 00:31:29.623
smoke signal and used that to attack.

00:31:29.623 --> 00:31:31.527
MARISHA: The de Rolos have dinosaurs?

00:31:31.527 --> 00:31:35.840
SAM: No, it was me. It's all good, though. I
caused a ruckus, that's all I was supposed to do.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.028
TRAVIS: That's it, yeah.

00:31:37.028 --> 00:31:38.478
MATT: "What is going on?"

00:31:38.478 --> 00:31:39.577
TRAVIS: Right.

00:31:39.577 --> 00:31:43.568
TALIESIN: We may have just started a revolution.

00:31:43.598 --> 00:31:46.278
MARISHA: Does he look familiar to you?

00:31:46.278 --> 00:31:51.949
LIAM: You don't recognize us, it's not safe to
walk these streets for outsiders, so we were using

00:31:51.949 --> 00:31:58.779
a little bit of trickery. This is us. We're the
same people you were dealing with before.

00:31:58.779 --> 00:32:00.360
TRAVIS: Vox Machina.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.088
LAURA: We just need to rest.

00:32:02.088 --> 00:32:07.559
MATT: "Okay. You can rest here, but how long?"

00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:09.610
LAURA: Until we're healed, and then we'll go.

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:11.012
LIAM: Overnight.

00:32:11.012 --> 00:32:13.148
MATT: "All right."

00:32:13.148 --> 00:32:16.250
LAURA: I feel like we should get word out to
somebody, though, because--

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:18.649
SAM: To what? To hold the revolution?

00:32:18.649 --> 00:32:21.477
LAURA: I feel like everybody's going to die before
we even get to the castle!

00:32:21.477 --> 00:32:24.448
MARISHA: That's the thing. I don't know if this is
the time to rest.

00:32:24.448 --> 00:32:26.459
LAURA: But we don't have any spells.

00:32:26.459 --> 00:32:31.627
MARISHA: I'm okay. We can maybe make do.

00:32:31.627 --> 00:32:34.794
LAURA: I can't make do.

00:32:34.794 --> 00:32:38.019
TRAVIS: You might be cool, but we're fucked.

00:32:38.019 --> 00:32:43.918
TALIESIN: How about we stay here until 4:00, 5:00
in the morning--

00:32:43.918 --> 00:32:45.440
MARISHA: What time is it now?

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.470
MATT: Right now, I'd say you're close to three in
the afternoon.

00:32:49.528 --> 00:32:53.469
LAURA: How do we tell the people to like hold
off?

00:32:53.469 --> 00:32:55.232
SAM: We need to briefly quell the rebellion?

00:32:55.232 --> 00:32:58.841
MARISHA: We started something. We can't stop it
now.

00:32:58.841 --> 00:33:05.282
TALIESIN: We're going to be indoors. It doesn't
matter what time we go to attack the castle.

00:33:05.282 --> 00:33:10.252
SAM: Let's spread word. We can spread word. Let's
find a few--

00:33:10.252 --> 00:33:13.007
LAURA: Can we send off a message?

00:33:13.007 --> 00:33:23.632
MARISHA: We sparked a hope in people. We now have
innocent peasants, people who are not fighters--

00:33:23.632 --> 00:33:28.549
SAM: Can you Skywrite something like "attack
tomorrow" or "hold"?

00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:32.052
LAURA: What if we all take off in separate
directions and we tell all the peasants we find

00:33:32.092 --> 00:33:35.275
that are fighting the time that we're going to
attack?

00:33:35.275 --> 00:33:39.522
TRAVIS: Aren't there a bunch of zombie stone
giants walking around?

00:33:39.522 --> 00:33:43.760
LAURA: Well yeah, we'll have to be sneaky about
it, but we'll spread the rumors around. I look at

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.904
Jordana. Joanna?

00:33:45.904 --> 00:33:47.072
MATT: Jordana.

00:33:47.072 --> 00:33:53.628
LAURA: Jordana. And I say, can you get word out
to people?

00:33:53.628 --> 00:34:01.643
MATT: "To a few, maybe. I don't want to go outside
right now."

00:34:01.643 --> 00:34:03.471
LAURA: I don't blame you, dear.

00:34:03.471 --> 00:34:09.125
TALIESIN: Let's let her stay. I say we just rest
up and we attack tonight.

00:34:09.125 --> 00:34:11.712
TRAVIS: Tonight?

00:34:11.712 --> 00:34:14.474
MARISHA: What if there isn't a town to defend
tonight?

00:34:14.474 --> 00:34:17.943
TRAVIS: Aren't they stronger then?

00:34:17.943 --> 00:34:21.417
TALIESIN: It's going to be indoors, anyway.

00:34:21.417 --> 00:34:26.043
SAM: First of all, it's raining outside. It's
daytime. There's no vampires out there right now,

00:34:26.043 --> 00:34:27.905
right? They don't like water, do they?

00:34:27.905 --> 00:34:30.752
LAURA: No, they don't like running water, in fact
they hate running water!

00:34:30.752 --> 00:34:32.477
I didn't think about that.

00:34:32.477 --> 00:34:35.504
MARISHA: It's a lot of running water, though. I
think they're all right with rain.

00:34:35.504 --> 00:34:37.973
TRAVIS: Yeah, they said a river is what the...
right?

00:34:37.973 --> 00:34:45.710
SAM: I'm sure they don't like it. In any case, the only
thing that our rebels are rebelling against right

00:34:45.745 --> 00:34:51.594
now are six zombie giants, one of whom I'm pretty
sure they killed already. Did I see them?

00:34:51.594 --> 00:34:55.837
MATT: Best you could see, that group was doing
pretty well and was hacking it down. Lost a few of

00:34:55.837 --> 00:34:57.193
their number in the process.

00:34:57.193 --> 00:34:59.272
MARISHA: Did we ever get a count of how many
zombie giants there were?

00:34:59.272 --> 00:35:00.245
SAM: There were six.

00:35:00.245 --> 00:35:03.247
MATT: There were six that you saw while you were
doing your overall flight.

00:35:03.247 --> 00:35:04.967
LAURA: What, so we go out and fight zombie
giants?

00:35:04.967 --> 00:35:07.375
SAM: No, but maybe we could--

00:35:07.375 --> 00:35:14.140
MARISHA: Why not? We are the most capable people
in this town right now.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:19.203
LAURA: Well. We could go fight zombie giants and
then tell everybody to wait.

00:35:19.203 --> 00:35:23.154
TRAVIS: Nah, it's going to fuck us. We've got to
rest.

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:30.546
MARISHA: Why don't we take a short rest, heal up a
bit, get back out there, take down some giants.

00:35:30.546 --> 00:35:32.576
What do you guys say?

00:35:32.576 --> 00:35:36.751
SAM: I admire this fire in your eyes, but it's so
stupid.

00:35:36.751 --> 00:35:39.585
LAURA: What if we run out and tell people to stop
fucking fighting and wait until tomorrow?

00:35:39.585 --> 00:35:44.736
LIAM: They won't. The giants are going to keep
smashing them.

00:35:44.736 --> 00:35:46.889
SAM: What time did he say it was?

00:35:46.889 --> 00:35:51.416
TALIESIN: It's about three. We could just do a
round of the front courtyard and see what's going on.

00:35:51.416 --> 00:35:53.450
LAURA: Fuck! Fine.

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:55.715
TALIESIN: Try and sleep through the night.

00:35:55.715 --> 00:35:58.143
LAURA: All right. We fight until we absolutely
can't fight anymore.

00:35:58.143 --> 00:36:01.736
TRAVIS: What about the people who absolutely need a
short rest at the minimum stay.

00:36:01.773 --> 00:36:02.986
LIAM: We stay for an hour.

00:36:02.986 --> 00:36:04.798
TALIESIN: We're short-resting right now.

00:36:04.798 --> 00:36:06.125
LIAM: Rest for an hour.

00:36:06.125 --> 00:36:10.005
MARISHA: This is going to go on for a while, but
the longer we wait indoors, the more people are

00:36:10.005 --> 00:36:17.981
going to die, and if we're killing people to try
and save the masses-- which is how I'm justifying

00:36:17.981 --> 00:36:23.276
this whole thing, by the way-- I feel like we
can't leave the masses to their own devices.

00:36:23.276 --> 00:36:28.786
SAM: Wait a second, what about that, what about
that cleric, the religious man that you've talked

00:36:28.786 --> 00:36:32.423
to. Could he get a message out to everybody?
What's his name?

00:36:32.423 --> 00:36:34.016
LAURA: At this point, though, it's chaos.

00:36:34.016 --> 00:36:35.007
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:36:35.007 --> 00:36:39.063
MARISHA: We literally lit the fire and we can't
stop it now.

00:36:39.063 --> 00:36:40.500
SAM: Archibald? Is that his name?

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.979
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're standing up for themselves.

00:36:41.979 --> 00:36:47.075
TALIESIN: We also, somebody-- there's the point
that somebody is informing on us.

00:36:47.075 --> 00:36:49.016
MARISHA: Someone &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; informing on us.

00:36:49.016 --> 00:36:50.447
SAM: What are you talking about, why?

00:36:50.447 --> 00:36:51.956
TALIESIN: They were ready for us. They knew we
were coming.

00:36:51.956 --> 00:36:53.447
SAM: Of course they knew we were coming, we killed
one of their--

00:36:53.447 --> 00:36:56.825
LAURA: They said there was an informant. They said
that there was an informant when we were there.

00:36:56.825 --> 00:36:57.738
TRAVIS: Who did?

00:36:57.738 --> 00:37:03.112
LAURA: That guard. He said our contacts were
right. Our informant was correct. Somebody is

00:37:03.112 --> 00:37:05.931
informing on us. It could be you.

00:37:05.931 --> 00:37:07.676
LIAM: I insight-check this woman.

00:37:07.676 --> 00:37:09.812
MATT: Go ahead and roll insight.

00:37:09.812 --> 00:37:13.152
LIAM: 14.

00:37:13.152 --> 00:37:16.968
LAURA: Can I say it? Because I just said, "It
could be you." Can I do the same thing?

00:37:16.968 --> 00:37:18.927
MATT: Sure, go ahead.

00:37:18.927 --> 00:37:24.306
LAURA: All right. That's terrible. Okay. So.

00:37:24.306 --> 00:37:25.750
SAM: What do you want to know?

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:30.385
MATT: Best that you can tell, she just looks
genuinely scared and is uncomfortable with your

00:37:30.385 --> 00:37:34.589
presence right now but is letting it happen. She's
still getting over the fact that you guys look

00:37:34.589 --> 00:37:37.869
entirely different than when you first talked to
her about staying here.

00:37:37.869 --> 00:37:41.258
LAURA: Well, short rest and then we head out? We
do some attacks and--

00:37:41.258 --> 00:37:43.787
LIAM: I've never fought a zombie giant before.

00:37:43.787 --> 00:37:46.819
LAURA: No, but everybody else is doing it. Those
peasants are doing it.

00:37:46.819 --> 00:37:50.827
LIAM: That's what I'm saying. Let's see what we're
up against. Let's take a breather and let's go

00:37:50.827 --> 00:37:52.083
pick one off.

00:37:52.083 --> 00:37:58.487
MARISHA: Jordana, do you have any books here on
zombie giants?

00:37:58.487 --> 00:38:09.088
MATT: "For the most part, necromancy is not
studied in this town. At least, we never had to

00:38:09.088 --> 00:38:15.447
"deal with it until recently, and we haven't had
the opportunity to really study since."

00:38:15.447 --> 00:38:22.074
MARISHA: Well, I mean, zombie combined with
giants. We've fought zombies and we've fought

00:38:22.074 --> 00:38:25.939
giants, so I'm assuming it with a vague--

00:38:25.939 --> 00:38:28.080
TRAVIS: What?

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.522
LAURA: We keep our distance.

00:38:29.522 --> 00:38:32.128
TALIESIN: How long does it take to recharge Hex,
by the way?

00:38:32.128 --> 00:38:34.248
MATT: You need a long rest.

00:38:34.248 --> 00:38:37.566
TRAVIS: How many Sunbeam hadoukens do you have
left, Keyleth?

00:38:37.566 --> 00:38:42.109
MARISHA: How many hadoukens? As in Sunbeams? I'm
done on Sunbeams.

00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:43.944
SAM: We need to rest.

00:38:43.944 --> 00:38:45.339
TRAVIS: If we get a short rest, how many do you
get?

00:38:45.339 --> 00:38:46.552
MARISHA: I'm done. None.

00:38:46.552 --> 00:38:47.940
LAURA: We need a long rest to get spells.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:52.627
MARISHA: However, if I short rest, I actually
haven't burnt any of my animal forms here recently

00:38:52.627 --> 00:38:59.260
and I can water elemental up, which would also
permanently kill them. So I have other defenses

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:04.472
that could still take down vampires if we
encounter another one. I'm more concerned about

00:39:04.472 --> 00:39:06.181
these giants right now.

00:39:06.181 --> 00:39:07.990
TRAVIS: That's what I'm talking about. They're
vampires.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:10.311
MARISHA: No, they're zombies. They're undead.

00:39:10.311 --> 00:39:11.293
LAURA: They're zombies.

00:39:11.293 --> 00:39:12.305
LIAM: They're undead.

00:39:12.305 --> 00:39:13.860
TRAVIS: Those are two different things, huh?

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.327
MATT: They are two very different things.

00:39:15.327 --> 00:39:16.519
TRAVIS: Grog learns.

00:39:16.519 --> 00:39:18.797
(laughter)

00:39:18.797 --> 00:39:22.613
MATT: All right. So what's the plan?

00:39:22.613 --> 00:39:24.937
LAURA: We short rest and get back out.

00:39:24.937 --> 00:39:27.665
LIAM: We take a short rest and then exterminate.

00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:32.436
SAM: Wait, join the rebellion or ride around town
telling everyone, "quell?"

00:39:32.436 --> 00:39:37.380
MARISHA: We're taking down these damn giants.
These giants are killing people left and right; we

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.858
watched them crush people on our way here.

00:39:39.858 --> 00:39:42.428
TALIESIN: We tell them that they take cover during
the night.

00:39:42.428 --> 00:39:44.292
TRAVIS: I'm going to roll four hit dice.

00:39:44.292 --> 00:39:47.212
MATT: Yeah, you guys go ahead, use your hit dice to
heal up while you're taking your short rest

00:39:47.291 --> 00:39:48.710
for those who've taken damage.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:51.122
LAURA: Oh, Trinket. Can you heal Trinket?

00:39:51.202 --> 00:39:52.395
MARISHA: I can.

00:39:52.395 --> 00:39:59.662
LAURA: Heal him so much. Does Trinket get... oh,
he does get hit dice.

00:39:59.662 --> 00:40:05.729
MATT: Trinket technically does not. Trinket
requires--

00:40:05.729 --> 00:40:08.071
LAURA: It says he does. It's written down.

00:40:08.071 --> 00:40:09.031
MATT: Hit dice?

00:40:09.031 --> 00:40:09.788
LAURA: Yeah.

00:40:09.788 --> 00:40:10.728
MATT: Okay.

00:40:10.728 --> 00:40:17.882
TALIESIN: Also, another strange question: what
creates initiative? Initiative is your dexterity

00:40:17.882 --> 00:40:18.870
modifier?

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:19.911
MATT: Correct.

00:40:19.911 --> 00:40:22.264
TALIESIN: So with me, it's my dexterity modifier.
Plus two.

00:40:22.264 --> 00:40:23.334
MATT: Correct.

00:40:23.334 --> 00:40:26.185
TALIESIN: I'm also currently wearing a Headband of
Initiative, which I'd forgotten about.

00:40:26.185 --> 00:40:27.250
MATT: Which...?

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:29.025
TALIESIN: Gives me plus two to my initiative.

00:40:29.025 --> 00:40:29.797
MATT: Correct.

00:40:29.797 --> 00:40:31.590
TALIESIN: Oh, dear god almighty. Okay. Thank you.

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:34.741
MATT: Percy, Percy, Percy.

00:40:34.741 --> 00:40:37.040
TALIESIN: I don't mean to be doing this.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:42.500
MATT: No, it's great. Just glad you didn't take the
Alertness feat. Then things would have gotten

00:40:42.555 --> 00:40:43.733
stupid.

00:40:43.733 --> 00:40:45.442
LAURA: Are you healing Trinket?

00:40:45.442 --> 00:40:46.940
MARISHA: How much more does he need?

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:51.621
LAURA: He's at 36. He needs 24 more.

00:40:51.621 --> 00:40:56.413
TALIESIN: Actually, I'm going to be using the Hat
of Disguise just because it's probably safe. Does

00:40:56.413 --> 00:40:58.838
anybody want a Headband of Initiative?

00:40:58.838 --> 00:41:02.552
LAURA: Yeah. Do you not need it?

00:41:02.552 --> 00:41:05.022
TALIESIN: I can't wear two things on my head.

00:41:05.022 --> 00:41:07.086
LAURA: I don't have anything on my head.

00:41:07.086 --> 00:41:10.702
TALIESIN: So you've got plus two to your
initiative, and I'm losing plus two to my

00:41:10.702 --> 00:41:14.317
initiative. It's called a Headband of Initiative.

00:41:14.317 --> 00:41:16.050
MARISHA: You already have an eight to your
initiative.

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:17.711
LIAM: It's very mystical.

00:41:17.711 --> 00:41:22.625
TRAVIS: How much time do we have before the sun
that is being blocked by the rainclouds goes

00:41:22.625 --> 00:41:23.512
down?

00:41:23.512 --> 00:41:28.139
MATT: Well, you guys are taking a short rest,
about 30 minutes to an hour, so you have about two

00:41:28.139 --> 00:41:30.080
and a half, three hours before it goes down
entirely.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.861
TALIESIN: That should give us enough time to do a
quick tour. We already know their walking route,

00:41:33.861 --> 00:41:36.073
and I'm sure that the people are putting up a
fight.

00:41:36.073 --> 00:41:38.073
MARISHA: I'm going to give him a level two Cure
Wounds.

00:41:38.172 --> 00:41:38.953
LAURA: Okay.

00:41:38.953 --> 00:41:40.707
MARISHA: So do 2d8 plus ten.

00:41:40.707 --> 00:41:41.668
LAURA: Me?

00:41:41.668 --> 00:41:44.984
MARISHA: Sure. Me or you. Whoever feels more
comfortable.

00:41:44.984 --> 00:41:46.482
LAURA: I'll do it. It was good.

00:41:46.482 --> 00:41:52.686
MATT: During this rest, if you wanted to
spend some time with that cape--

00:41:52.782 --> 00:41:58.561
LIAM: I do. I'm going to sniff it and shake it
out.

00:41:58.634 --> 00:42:01.591
MATT: For the most part, it doesn't appear to be
enchanted.

00:42:01.641 --> 00:42:05.107
SAM: No, I can sing a Song of Rest for all of us.

00:42:05.107 --> 00:42:07.027
MARISHA and LAURA: Oh, yeah. Do that.

00:42:07.027 --> 00:42:10.632
SAM: It gives us all 1d6. That's pretty weak.

00:42:10.632 --> 00:42:12.873
MARISHA: No, but that's...

00:42:12.873 --> 00:42:15.442
LAURA: No, it's fine. He's got extra hit points;
don't worry about it.

00:42:15.442 --> 00:42:21.442
MARISHA: Well, Song of Rest just happens, right?
Do you get that for free? You might as well, if

00:42:21.442 --> 00:42:22.916
you don't burn anything.

00:42:22.916 --> 00:42:32.401
SAM: Okay. (sings) Health! We need some now.
Health! Not just anybody. Health! You know you

00:42:32.401 --> 00:42:33.552
need someone.

00:42:33.552 --> 00:42:35.239
ALL: (sings) Health!

00:42:35.239 --> 00:42:47.522
MATT: That's not trademarked at all. I love it.
All right, so you guys have rested up. Through the

00:42:47.522 --> 00:42:53.651
rest, you occasionally hear voices run by,
yelling. As you guys get toward the end of your

00:42:53.651 --> 00:43:03.799
rest, you hear the (stomping) large heavy
footfalls heading nearby. (groaning, crash) A

00:43:03.799 --> 00:43:07.577
loud, heavy impact, and you hear some short cheers
outside.

00:43:07.577 --> 00:43:08.640
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.683
LAURA: Yay!

00:43:09.683 --> 00:43:11.964
SAM: Oh, he died. That's two down. Splash two.

00:43:11.964 --> 00:43:17.314
TRAVIS: Right out front, we hear it?

00:43:17.314 --> 00:43:21.517
MATT: Out front, a little ways off. Not
immediately.

00:43:21.517 --> 00:43:23.515
SAM: Do we have horses? We don't have any horses,
do we?

00:43:23.515 --> 00:43:24.249
LAURA: No.

00:43:24.249 --> 00:43:25.142
LIAM: They died.

00:43:25.142 --> 00:43:26.972
MATT: Yeah, they got eaten by harpies.

00:43:26.972 --> 00:43:28.841
TRAVIS: Should we go outside and see how they're
doing?

00:43:28.841 --> 00:43:30.466
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's check it out.

00:43:30.466 --> 00:43:31.904
TRAVIS: We go out front.

00:43:31.904 --> 00:43:33.812
LIAM: Time to kill some giant undead.

00:43:33.812 --> 00:43:35.599
MATT: Okay. Jordana lets you guys out, locks
behind her.

00:43:35.599 --> 00:43:36.793
MARISHA: Do we want to split up?

00:43:36.793 --> 00:43:38.242
TALIESIN: No, let's keep together.

00:43:38.242 --> 00:43:41.045
LAURA: Actually, before we go, I ask, do you have
any holy symbols at all in here?

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.574
MATT: "I'm sorry, no."

00:43:42.574 --> 00:43:43.723
LAURA: Nothing?

00:43:43.723 --> 00:43:49.264
MATT: "No. All those were kept in either of the
two temples here."

00:43:49.264 --> 00:43:51.743
LAURA: Do you have anything magic that could help
me?

00:43:51.743 --> 00:43:53.574
MATT: "I already gave you everything of magic that
I had here."

00:43:53.574 --> 00:43:55.474
LAURA: Oh, right. I forgot we took it.

00:43:55.474 --> 00:43:56.550
MATT: "Sorry."

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:58.177
LAURA: Shit. All right, thank you.

00:43:58.275 --> 00:44:00.071
TRAVIS: Once we're outside, how far away is that
giant that was felled?

00:44:00.071 --> 00:44:04.999
MATT: As you step outside and look, it's about 60
feet off, near one of the big crossroads near this

00:44:04.999 --> 00:44:09.887
area. And a zombie giant has been completely
felled down, and there are three people now that

00:44:09.887 --> 00:44:13.855
are currently in the process of hacking its head
off just to make sure. It's a group of about seven

00:44:13.855 --> 00:44:18.253
people that live here. They're all looking pretty
messed up, but they're all eager and

00:44:18.253 --> 00:44:24.347
adrenaline-driven, they're all hacking away, then
stopping and taking a breath (breathes heavily).

00:44:24.347 --> 00:44:28.746
You hear in the distance, (thunder crack) bolt of
lightning coming down from the storm, and as it

00:44:28.746 --> 00:44:35.222
echoes, everyone shakes for a second, look at each
other, (cheers) give a cheer of victory. They all

00:44:35.222 --> 00:44:40.725
hop off the body of the zombie giant and begin
darting further in towards the center of the city.

00:44:40.725 --> 00:44:43.935
MARISHA: I look up. Is my de Rolo symbol still in
the sky?

00:44:43.935 --> 00:44:48.244
MATT: It's there. It's dissipating slowly, but
it's still there. It's moved a little bit off-axis

00:44:48.244 --> 00:44:49.786
with the storm.

00:44:49.786 --> 00:44:54.334
TRAVIS: So that's it for the big houses, right?
Just the castle.

00:44:54.334 --> 00:44:55.444
TALIESIN: Just the castle.

00:44:55.444 --> 00:44:59.554
SAM: Except we haven't killed the members of one
of the houses. By the way, my Song of Rest is a d8.

00:44:59.623 --> 00:45:00.725
LAURA: Awesome.

00:45:00.725 --> 00:45:05.847
SAM: But we haven't killed the last one. Now, the
one that you guys killed. What's his name again,

00:45:05.847 --> 00:45:06.714
Tylieri?

00:45:06.714 --> 00:45:07.605
MATT: Tylieri.

00:45:07.605 --> 00:45:08.766
SAM: He was a vampire.

00:45:08.766 --> 00:45:09.806
ALL: Yes.

00:45:09.806 --> 00:45:15.905
SAM: Because Sylas killed him. Right?

00:45:15.905 --> 00:45:17.077
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:45:17.077 --> 00:45:19.415
SAM: And then made him a vampire.

00:45:19.415 --> 00:45:20.524
TALIESIN: One would assume.

00:45:20.524 --> 00:45:22.715
SAM: Didn't he hang him on the Sun Tree?

00:45:22.715 --> 00:45:25.732
LAURA: What? No. What? What are you talking
about?

00:45:25.732 --> 00:45:28.287
SAM: I don't know. Didn't that guy that we
meet...

00:45:28.287 --> 00:45:36.155
MATT: You do recall, actually, when you were
interrogating the driver of the Briarwoods.

00:45:36.155 --> 00:45:46.267
Tylieri was the master of the driver Desmond, who
beat him and subjugated him to various forms of

00:45:46.267 --> 00:45:53.941
torture and abuse before Lord Briarwood took
Desmond and, to try and show extension of faith,

00:45:53.941 --> 00:45:58.468
revealed to Desmond Tylieri hanging from the Sun
Tree. That was true.

00:45:58.468 --> 00:45:59.987
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:46:00.038 --> 00:46:04.369
SAM: And then he became a vampire. Is that where
they're spawning?

00:46:04.369 --> 00:46:10.417
LAURA: No. Maybe he was already a vampire and he
hung him from the tree just to show--

00:46:10.417 --> 00:46:13.438
SAM: That doesn't seem right.

00:46:13.438 --> 00:46:16.580
TALIESIN: Let's head to the Sun Tree, why don't
we?

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.947
LAURA: Let's head that direction.

00:46:18.947 --> 00:46:20.286
TRAVIS: Let's go.

00:46:20.286 --> 00:46:25.396
MARISHA: Something to us about how when people die
in this town. The guy you talked to at the bar?

00:46:25.396 --> 00:46:29.341
SAM: Yes, we talked to a guy at the bar. What
about him?

00:46:29.341 --> 00:46:32.829
MARISHA: He said when people die here they don't
die.

00:46:32.829 --> 00:46:34.648
SAM: Well, yes, we know that, yes.

00:46:34.648 --> 00:46:35.881
LAURA: They come back.

00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:38.995
LIAM: They could be-- yes, that could apply, too.

00:46:38.995 --> 00:46:44.087
MARISHA: I think this whole damn town-- I think
the whole land is cursed. Is what I think.

00:46:44.087 --> 00:46:45.281
TRAVIS: I think that's--

00:46:45.281 --> 00:46:46.687
LAURA: Probably pretty fair.

00:46:46.687 --> 00:46:48.517
TRAVIS: Should we go to the tree?

00:46:48.517 --> 00:46:49.517
LAURA: Sure.

00:46:49.517 --> 00:46:51.022
MARISHA: Why?

00:46:51.022 --> 00:46:53.751
TALIESIN: Just to see--

00:46:53.751 --> 00:46:56.748
LAURA: We'll make our way through the town and
look for giants as we make our way to the tree.

00:46:56.748 --> 00:46:58.919
MARISHA: Let's look for giants. Let's go
giant-hunting.

00:46:58.919 --> 00:47:04.355
MATT: Okay. All right, so from the Alcove, you guys
head in a southwestern motion, keeping off the

00:47:04.423 --> 00:47:11.711
main paths best you can. The main chaos seems to
have died down a little bit in this area of the

00:47:11.711 --> 00:47:19.193
town. You come across another body of a zombie
giant, surrounded by what looks like eight bodies

00:47:19.193 --> 00:47:21.352
of civilians of the town.

00:47:21.352 --> 00:47:23.208
LAURA: Are they all dead, or are they injured?

00:47:23.208 --> 00:47:28.259
MATT: No, they are all very dead. Two of which are
torn in half and just tossed to different sides,

00:47:28.259 --> 00:47:34.881
one appears to be half-eaten, and the rest are
just smashed. But whatever troop was with

00:47:34.881 --> 00:47:38.661
them managed to take the zombie giant down.
Eventually, you make your way to the center of the

00:47:38.721 --> 00:47:46.781
town square where the Sun Tree is and there is,
across the way on the opposite side, what appears

00:47:46.781 --> 00:47:54.526
to be, in mid-struggle, one zombie giant that has
a series of spears or javelins sticking out of its

00:47:54.526 --> 00:47:59.067
torso. It's currently swatting at a group of
individuals that have torches in the rain, still

00:47:59.067 --> 00:48:04.249
trying to get up towards it and push it backward.
The Sun Tree, at a glance-- roll a perception

00:48:04.249 --> 00:48:05.650
check.

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:06.506
MARISHA: All of us?

00:48:06.506 --> 00:48:07.929
MATT: Yes.

00:48:07.929 --> 00:48:12.480
TALIESIN: One. There's a tree!

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.829
SAM: Four.

00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:15.319
MARISHA: I rolled a 19, so 29?

00:48:15.319 --> 00:48:16.350
MATT: Okay.

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:17.310
LIAM: 23.

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:19.139
LAURA: If my passive perception's higher than my
roll--

00:48:19.139 --> 00:48:22.765
MATT: Active perception and passive perception--
passive is more something to keep track when

00:48:22.765 --> 00:48:26.517
you're not actively perceiving. So. Grog?

00:48:26.517 --> 00:48:27.674
TRAVIS: Seven.

00:48:27.674 --> 00:48:33.225
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, you pick this out in the
rain, and it's hard to see, but from this angle,

00:48:33.225 --> 00:48:41.881
you see what looks to be eight ropes, currently,
just dangling free from the Sun Tree.

00:48:41.881 --> 00:48:43.390
TALIESIN: Damn it.

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:44.590
LAURA: Shit.

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:46.425
SAM: The tree is the spawning spot.

00:48:46.425 --> 00:48:48.120
LAURA: Really?

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.330
SAM: Or maybe one of them.

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:52.400
TRAVIS: Or maybe they cut them down.

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.196
SAM: We've got to cut down this tree.

00:48:55.196 --> 00:48:58.201
LAURA: Does it look like the ropes have been cut?

00:48:58.201 --> 00:49:00.111
MATT: You can go closer to inspect it if you
want.

00:49:00.111 --> 00:49:01.190
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:05.600
MATT: You're hearing in the distance the (roars)
the battle's still raging about 65, 70 feet from

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:10.837
you. You get up behind the tree and you take the
ropes and inspect it. All the ropes are very

00:49:10.837 --> 00:49:11.909
finely cut.

00:49:11.909 --> 00:49:14.291
LAURA: Oh. They were cut. They cut them down.

00:49:14.291 --> 00:49:15.998
TRAVIS: They cut their dead down.

00:49:15.998 --> 00:49:17.839
MARISHA: Okay, so the nooses are gone.

00:49:17.839 --> 00:49:24.038
MATT: Yeah. And you do see, there are a number.
This close, you can see there are loops of rope

00:49:24.038 --> 00:49:29.337
all over the tree: some very old and weathered and
aged, some of them are torn, some of them are cut,

00:49:29.337 --> 00:49:34.991
but the fresh ones that are the longest currently
and that are placed closest to where the bodies

00:49:34.991 --> 00:49:37.430
were originally there are all very cleanly cut.

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:41.402
LAURA: Can we spin around and look and see if
there's anything around that looks like-- or look

00:49:41.402 --> 00:49:45.371
at tracking and see if it looks like somebody cut
them down or if they fell on their own?

00:49:45.371 --> 00:49:52.455
MATT: You glance around real fast and you can see
to the south there is still the battle raging

00:49:52.455 --> 00:49:55.965
between the zombie giant and the crew of
individuals, but you look back where you guys were

00:49:55.965 --> 00:50:01.813
from, and you see a large series of shapes
stepping through the rain, coming from the

00:50:01.813 --> 00:50:03.281
direction you guys were.

00:50:03.281 --> 00:50:07.132
LIAM: I think they cut them down just like
Tylieri. I think that this is where they hang them

00:50:07.132 --> 00:50:11.132
to ripen, and then when they're ready they pluck
them off the tree and set them on their way.

00:50:11.132 --> 00:50:16.193
MATT: As you're having this conversation, you,
keeping your eyes forward as he's saying this in

00:50:16.193 --> 00:50:23.182
your ear, you can see, as the light of the town is
slowly beginning to vanish into a sunset--

00:50:23.182 --> 00:50:24.584
MARISHA: Is it still raining?

00:50:24.584 --> 00:50:31.852
MATT: It is still raining. You see ahead of you,
coming from the central roadway into the square of

00:50:31.852 --> 00:50:40.585
the town, what you can only surmise to be anywhere
from 30 to 50 armored skeletal entities that are

00:50:40.585 --> 00:50:42.783
pouring from the north.

00:50:42.783 --> 00:50:44.644
MARISHA: Okay. I climb the Sun Tree.

00:50:44.644 --> 00:50:46.343
SAM: Wait, what? We've got to get out of here!

00:50:46.343 --> 00:50:47.626
MARISHA: I'm climbing the Sun Tree.

00:50:47.626 --> 00:50:51.103
MATT: Climbing the Sun Tree. All right. You guys
see Keyleth scurry up the Sun Tree.

00:50:51.103 --> 00:50:56.808
SAM: I blow my Horn of Fog to create a
smokescreen. I don't know what the fuck she's

00:50:56.808 --> 00:50:57.873
doing.

00:50:57.873 --> 00:51:03.153
MATT: Okay. (foghorn sound) The slow horn-blow
comes out, and this fog begins to fill the area

00:51:03.153 --> 00:51:08.845
between this marching skeletal army and the Sun
Tree where you guys currently are. Looking over

00:51:08.845 --> 00:51:13.324
your shoulder, you can see the zombie giant
finishes smashing the last individual in that

00:51:13.324 --> 00:51:18.074
crew, picks it up and jams it into its jagged
giant teeth.

00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:20.644
MARISHA: So there's a big army coming down,
filtering down a street.

00:51:20.644 --> 00:51:21.991
MATT: Down the street towards you.

00:51:21.991 --> 00:51:23.022
MARISHA: How far away?

00:51:23.022 --> 00:51:24.999
MATT: You can't tell now. There's just fog along
the way.

00:51:24.999 --> 00:51:26.613
MARISHA: I can't tell how far away they are right
now?

00:51:26.613 --> 00:51:27.714
MATT: No, you can't see them.

00:51:27.714 --> 00:51:29.253
MARISHA: I can't see them?

00:51:29.253 --> 00:51:33.588
MATT: No, because Scanlan just created a whole
bunch of fog between the two of you. The moment

00:51:33.588 --> 00:51:37.755
you saw, they may be about a hundred or so feet
from you.

00:51:37.755 --> 00:51:41.215
LIAM: Keyleth, tell us what you're thinking,
because the rest of us are taking this time to go.

00:51:41.215 --> 00:51:44.846
TRAVIS: You engage, they'll follow, we go, we
fight another day, we sleep in the rafters and

00:51:44.846 --> 00:51:46.486
wait until daybreak.

00:51:46.486 --> 00:51:48.103
LIAM: Who are you?

00:51:48.103 --> 00:51:53.391
MARISHA: I might be able to do something.

00:51:53.391 --> 00:51:55.474
LAURA: What is it? Say it!

00:51:55.474 --> 00:52:01.962
MARISHA: I can do a big ice storm or do something
to take all these fuckers out at once.

00:52:01.962 --> 00:52:04.714
TRAVIS: All 30 to 50 of them? Kill them all?

00:52:04.714 --> 00:52:06.330
MARISHA: It's a big range.

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:08.645
LIAM: No. Keyleth, we've got to go.

00:52:08.645 --> 00:52:15.015
TALIESIN: I say we let her hit them, and we run.

00:52:15.015 --> 00:52:20.145
MARISHA: Scanlan, can you drop the fog just a
bit?

00:52:20.145 --> 00:52:21.727
SAM: Nope, not by magic.

00:52:21.727 --> 00:52:22.975
MATT: He can't control it.

00:52:22.975 --> 00:52:27.115
LAURA: It's on the ground. You can probably see
above it. Fog is low.

00:52:27.115 --> 00:52:32.755
MATT: Well, the fog this creates is a magical fog
that obscures an entire area. If you climbed to

00:52:32.755 --> 00:52:35.695
the very top of the tree, you might be able to get
a little bit of a visual.

00:52:35.695 --> 00:52:38.664
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to climb as high as
I can.

00:52:38.664 --> 00:52:40.525
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check.

00:52:40.525 --> 00:52:42.111
LAURA: I'm going to climb up after her.

00:52:42.111 --> 00:52:43.529
SAM: Oh my god.

00:52:43.529 --> 00:52:49.947
MARISHA: 11. Acrobatics or athletics?

00:52:49.947 --> 00:52:51.023
MATT: Athletics.

00:52:51.023 --> 00:52:53.329
MARISHA: Oh, that's better. 15.

00:52:53.423 --> 00:52:59.948
MATT: 15. Okay. You make your way up to the very
precarious top of the branches. You can feel the

00:52:59.948 --> 00:53:04.565
brittleness of it as the tree itself, its life
force is withered over time and some of it cracks

00:53:04.565 --> 00:53:10.754
and some of the actual bark of the tree twists off
in your grip as you get to the very top. You can look

00:53:10.786 --> 00:53:15.893
just over the bank of fog that Scanlan has created
and you can see beyond that. The number of undead

00:53:15.893 --> 00:53:20.933
from this angle, what was initially like 30
probably pushes closer to about a hundred.

00:53:20.933 --> 00:53:24.957
MARISHA: Okay. And they're like a hundred feet
away?

00:53:24.957 --> 00:53:27.615
MATT: Starting about a hundred feet away, slowly
marching towards you.

00:53:27.701 --> 00:53:33.597
MARISHA: Right where they are, I'm going to start
a little ahead of where they originate, I'm going

00:53:33.645 --> 00:53:39.878
to start making an ice storm. I'm pushing all the
way back to where-- just right down these

00:53:39.878 --> 00:53:40.717
fuckers.

00:53:40.717 --> 00:53:43.616
LIAM: I'm also just trying to stay underneath her
as best I can.

00:53:43.616 --> 00:53:46.564
LAURA: Stop looking up her skirt, brother.

00:53:46.564 --> 00:53:48.397
LIAM: Is she in a skirt?

00:53:48.397 --> 00:53:50.738
SAM: She's been wearing a dress this whole time?

00:53:50.738 --> 00:53:52.376
LIAM: I thought she was covered in leaves.

00:53:52.376 --> 00:53:55.114
TALIESIN: Stop looking up her fig leaf.

00:53:55.114 --> 00:54:00.547
MATT: All right. What's the damage on that? Is it
2d8 bludgeoning and 2d8--

00:54:00.547 --> 00:54:04.138
MARISHA: They take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6
cold damage.

00:54:04.138 --> 00:54:09.147
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for both. And it's a
save for half, right?

00:54:09.147 --> 00:54:10.639
TALIESIN: Inspiration?

00:54:10.639 --> 00:54:13.008
SAM: Oh. Well. I didn't do it.

00:54:13.008 --> 00:54:28.408
MARISHA: 2d8 bludgeoning, that's seven
bludgeoning... 4d6. Not great at all. Four, five,

00:54:28.408 --> 00:54:29.908
six, seven, eight.

00:54:29.908 --> 00:54:34.186
MATT: Total of eight. Eight plus... what was the
other one?

00:54:34.186 --> 00:54:35.418
MARISHA: Seven.

00:54:35.418 --> 00:54:37.030
MATT: Seven, okay.

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:38.828
MARISHA: And it's difficult terrain.

00:54:38.828 --> 00:54:46.364
MATT: Okay. So the first area. Suddenly you see
some of the clouds above you begin to funnel

00:54:46.364 --> 00:54:52.791
downward, and a few bolts of electricity (crackle)
through it. As the funnel hits, it grows dark, and

00:54:52.791 --> 00:54:58.888
then all of a sudden this cold wind begins to
swirl around it. And with that, the cloud almost

00:54:58.888 --> 00:55:04.790
seems to tear open within itself and a sheet of
jagged ice and sleet begins to pour downward into

00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:12.179
the center of this undead horde. As it does, you
can see probably a good 25, 30 of these are just

00:55:12.179 --> 00:55:19.319
blown apart, bone shards scattered around and you
can see bits of rusted metal weapons and armor

00:55:19.319 --> 00:55:25.259
thrown left and right. The ice then coalesces over
the floor of this area and some of the skeletons

00:55:25.259 --> 00:55:31.540
just slip, but they keep marching forward. It
definitely took a chunk, but as it continues

00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:32.971
pushing forward--

00:55:32.971 --> 00:55:36.949
MARISHA: Now we can run.

00:55:36.949 --> 00:55:41.140
LAURA: Good job. I grab the back of her 
shirt and yank her towards me.

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:47.263
MATT: You guys make your way down the tree.
As you get to the bottom of the tree, the zombie

00:55:47.341 --> 00:55:55.578
giant has taken notice of the sudden flashing of
light and the movement in the tree and is bounding

00:55:55.578 --> 00:55:57.688
towards the tree after you guys.

00:55:57.688 --> 00:55:59.633
LAURA: Are we running?

00:55:59.633 --> 00:56:01.872
TRAVIS: Are we going to the Alcove or going to the
treeline?

00:56:01.932 --> 00:56:05.240
TALIESIN: I say we go to the treeline, and I say
that you take a couple shots as we're heading--

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:10.455
LAURA: I'm definitely doing that, yes. I'm going
to shoot at the giant as we're running. Hunter's

00:56:10.455 --> 00:56:11.442
Mark him.

00:56:11.442 --> 00:56:13.512
MATT: Okay, you Hunter's Mark, turning around,
looking at the giant.

00:56:13.512 --> 00:56:17.565
MARISHA: As she says that, I'm going to go ahead
and start casting my Call Lightning spell.

00:56:17.565 --> 00:56:22.649
MATT: Okay. So you land and you cast Call
Lightning. The fog that you created, Scanlan?

00:56:22.649 --> 00:56:23.652
SAM: Yes.

00:56:23.652 --> 00:56:28.794
MATT: Has formed up. You start seeing shapes;
these terrifying skeletal faces begin to appear

00:56:28.794 --> 00:56:35.641
through the fog as the rest of the army begins to
push through. The clouds coalescing above Keyleth

00:56:35.641 --> 00:56:39.611
as you get your Call Lightning ready, you marking
the zombie giant, you guys begin bolting out of

00:56:39.611 --> 00:56:43.841
the way. Trinket comes running up behind you, Vex,
and picks you up onto his back, and you guys begin

00:56:43.841 --> 00:56:46.272
rushing off toward the treeline-- to the west or
the east?

00:56:46.272 --> 00:56:47.560
LAURA: Can I shoot him?

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.812
MARISHA: Yeah, as I turn around, I Call Lightning
on the giant.

00:56:49.812 --> 00:56:52.604
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll damage on that.

00:56:52.647 --> 00:56:56.113
MARISHA: And it's cloudy, so I get how much more?

00:56:56.113 --> 00:57:00.287
MATT: I don't know, how much do you get more on
that? Call Lightning would be...

00:57:00.331 --> 00:57:03.201
SAM: While you decide, which way are we going,
Percy? West or east?

00:57:03.201 --> 00:57:08.022
MATT: 3d10. It does an additional d10. It does
4d10.

00:57:08.022 --> 00:57:12.502
LAURA: And I'm going to shoot him through my
Longbow of the Sky Sentinel as we're going away, too.

00:57:12.502 --> 00:57:13.963
MATT: Okay.

00:57:13.963 --> 00:57:21.742
TALIESIN: So the passage to the castle I'm aware
of is to the west, and then the one that Stonefell

00:57:21.742 --> 00:57:24.512
mentioned is to the east?

00:57:24.512 --> 00:57:25.984
TRAVIS: Do we go to the treeline by the castle?

00:57:25.984 --> 00:57:27.463
MATT: No, the one Stonefell mentioned was the
same.

00:57:27.463 --> 00:57:28.313
TALIESIN: Was the same?

00:57:28.313 --> 00:57:30.082
MATT: It wasn't Stonefell, it was Vouk.

00:57:30.082 --> 00:57:31.283
TALIESIN: Yeah, thank you.

00:57:31.283 --> 00:57:33.022
MATT: But yeah. He was referring to the same one.

00:57:33.022 --> 00:57:34.913
TALIESIN: Treeline to the west so that we can
attack first thing.

00:57:34.913 --> 00:57:37.262
LAURA: 22. Twice.

00:57:37.262 --> 00:57:38.462
MATT: 22 hits.

00:57:38.462 --> 00:57:40.062
LAURA: And then three on the last one.

00:57:40.062 --> 00:57:41.202
MATT: Okay, yeah.

00:57:41.202 --> 00:57:43.402
LAURA: Well, it's technically 14 on the last one.

00:57:43.402 --> 00:57:46.324
MATT: For him? Still hits.

00:57:46.324 --> 00:57:47.323
LAURA: Oh, sweet!

00:57:47.323 --> 00:57:50.362
MATT: It's a big target. Big target, lot of hit
points.

00:57:50.362 --> 00:57:55.472
MARISHA: And as she's brewing up her bow, I'm
behind her and just bring down the bolt for 32

00:57:55.472 --> 00:57:56.510
damage.

00:57:56.510 --> 00:58:00.474
MATT: Damn. (lightning sound) You can see the bolt
strikes the front of the zombie giant right as it

00:58:00.474 --> 00:58:05.892
starts swinging after you guys. The bolt hits its
shoulder and blasts a chunk of its shoulder blade

00:58:05.892 --> 00:58:10.773
off. You see bone shards fire behind, and there's
a giant piece of its torso now missing where the

00:58:10.773 --> 00:58:15.212
bolt hit. (groans) Stumbles back onto its back
foot and catches itself, almost toppling over.

00:58:15.212 --> 00:58:17.733
MARISHA: Just start backing up. "Vex?"

00:58:17.733 --> 00:58:22.184
MATT: It starts lumbering forward again as Vex
releases her arrow, which splits into three.

00:58:22.184 --> 00:58:23.476
MARISHA: Vex?

00:58:23.476 --> 00:58:25.823
LAURA: 54 points of damage.

00:58:25.823 --> 00:58:26.775
MARISHA: Kill it!

00:58:26.775 --> 00:58:35.050
MATT: Nice! (impact sounds) All the arrows
blasting into its body, you can see they sink in

00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:40.235
and burst on the inside. There's a little, a dull
glow as this burst of electrical energy hits from

00:58:40.235 --> 00:58:45.944
underneath its sickly zombified flesh. At which
point, there's a slight delay before it (explosion

00:58:45.944 --> 00:58:50.733
sound) bubbles forth and a bit of its internal
liquid just spews out like a boil. You can see

00:58:50.733 --> 00:58:57.260
it's definitely taking damage, and it keeps
pushing forward. Yeah, it's still moving towards

00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:58.284
you guys.

00:58:58.284 --> 00:58:59.565
LIAM: How far away is it?

00:58:59.565 --> 00:59:00.796
TALIESIN: For gods' sakes!

00:59:00.796 --> 00:59:02.758
MATT: It's about ten feet from you guys right
now.

00:59:02.758 --> 00:59:10.764
TALIESIN: I pull out Bad News. I'm shooting it
with Bad News, and I'm going for an aimed shot to

00:59:10.764 --> 00:59:12.405
the legs.

00:59:12.405 --> 00:59:18.204
MATT: Okay. The moment it would take for you to
stop and pull out Bad News, by the way, the moment

00:59:18.204 --> 00:59:21.534
you guys are turning around to attack it, it has
gotten within range to hit, so this is all

00:59:21.534 --> 00:59:25.815
happening simultaneously, so it's going to get two
strikes as you guys get your attacks, as well.

00:59:25.815 --> 00:59:27.226
MARISHA: What are you doing?

00:59:27.226 --> 00:59:29.013
MATT: So. Go ahead and roll your attack.

00:59:29.013 --> 00:59:29.874
LIAM: I did.

00:59:29.874 --> 00:59:30.705
MATT: What did you get?

00:59:30.705 --> 00:59:31.524
LIAM: 27 and an 18.

00:59:31.524 --> 00:59:32.535
MATT: Both hit.

00:59:32.535 --> 00:59:34.775
TALIESIN: I got 28.

00:59:34.775 --> 00:59:41.674
MATT: Okay. And against Percy, that is a 17 and a
20.

00:59:41.674 --> 00:59:44.234
TALIESIN: 17 misses. The 20 hits.

00:59:44.234 --> 00:59:55.573
MATT: Okay. You take 16 points of bludgeoning
damage as its fist comes down and (whack) slams

00:59:55.610 --> 01:00:00.205
into your side just as Bad News fires off and your
daggers go (dagger sounds) towards it.

01:00:00.205 --> 01:00:02.522
LIAM: Keen Dagger, Flametongue, combined 20 hit
points.

01:00:02.594 --> 01:00:05.121
MATT: Okay. Good to know.

01:00:05.121 --> 01:00:09.711
MARISHA: And as soon as I'm able, I'm backing up
and bringing down another lightning bolt.

01:00:09.711 --> 01:00:11.894
LAURA: Well, I've got another attack. That was
just one attack that I did.

01:00:11.894 --> 01:00:13.750
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:16.591
SAM: You need your spells. We need to hide. We
need to run.

01:00:16.591 --> 01:00:21.871
MARISHA: It's okay, this is a concentration spell.
I can keep doing it. I'm not blowing spells on it.

01:00:21.871 --> 01:00:25.490
TALIESIN: 22 points of damage, plus he's knocked
prone.

01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:28.120
MATT: Okay. Easy enough. Through the daggers--

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.054
TALIESIN: Oh, he can make a con saving throw,
though.

01:00:30.054 --> 01:00:36.252
MATT: It doesn't matter. It still manages to keep
its zombie form, though it seems like every single

01:00:36.252 --> 01:00:40.301
hit you're taking chunks off its body, but it
continues to push through the damage until

01:00:40.301 --> 01:00:45.170
eventually it swings at you with the hit, Bad News
goes off as it blasts through the center of its

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:49.440
torso and takes out the back of its spine. It
can't keep its physical form together, and as its

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.351
body lunges forward, you throw both of your
daggers, which go (thoonk thoonk) into each of its

01:00:53.351 --> 01:00:59.032
eyes. It falls forward. The torso seems to roll on
impact and come after you like a slow-moving

01:00:59.032 --> 01:01:03.133
boulder for a few feet, but since you're all
moving forward, you manage to outrun it, just

01:01:03.133 --> 01:01:07.096
barely keeping out of the way. The legs
walk on their own for two more steps before it

01:01:07.193 --> 01:01:14.255
just falls forward into the mud, relieving all its
intestines into the rain-soaked ground.

01:01:14.255 --> 01:01:15.777
SAM: Let's get out of here!

01:01:15.777 --> 01:01:16.981
MARISHA: Go, go, go. Run!

01:01:16.981 --> 01:01:18.482
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace!

01:01:18.482 --> 01:01:20.112
TRAVIS: Aggressive flower girl.

01:01:20.112 --> 01:01:23.372
MARISHA: Do I see any other-- as we're running
through--

01:01:23.372 --> 01:01:24.755
LAURA: Just run, Keyleth!

01:01:24.755 --> 01:01:26.814
LIAM: I grab Keyleth by the arm and I just pull
and run.

01:01:26.814 --> 01:01:29.752
MATT: You guys go running back and as you're
looking over your shoulder you can see the

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:36.302
skeletal army swarming the center of the square
and pouring into the streets. It seems that the

01:01:36.302 --> 01:01:42.472
Briarwoods had their own reserve anti-riot
campaign at the ready.

01:01:42.472 --> 01:01:44.643
LAURA: Oh, are they going to take out everybody?

01:01:44.643 --> 01:01:46.232
MARISHA: We can't go, we can't go!

01:01:46.232 --> 01:01:49.168
SAM: We have to go. We have nothing left.

01:01:49.168 --> 01:01:51.650
MATT: And with that, we're going to conclude
tonight's session.

01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:53.313
(groaning)

01:01:53.313 --> 01:01:58.132
MATT: We'll be returning next week on that note.

01:01:58.132 --> 01:02:02.723
TRAVIS: (laughs) You son of a bitch, I love it.

01:02:02.723 --> 01:02:08.531
MATT: All right, so we're going to take a little break
here while we set up for Critmas. Quick one, very

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:13.101
quick, we'll be back here in just a few minutes,
for those who want to hang in and watch how

01:02:13.101 --> 01:02:15.152
ridiculously amazing this community is.

01:02:15.152 --> 01:02:17.744
LAURA: Oh my gosh. There's like, there's a lot.

01:02:17.744 --> 01:02:19.402
MARISHA: Yeah, you guys are crazy.

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:21.374
LIAM: Buckle up!

01:02:21.374 --> 01:02:24.043
MATT: All right, quick break. See you in a
second.
