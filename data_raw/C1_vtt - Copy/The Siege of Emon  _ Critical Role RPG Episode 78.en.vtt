00:00:00.223 --> 00:00:03.363
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.363 --> 00:00:08.265
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. We have a bunch of

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:11.723
announcements; try and get through them as fast as
possible. First and foremost, Taliesin Jaffe is on

00:00:11.723 --> 00:00:14.958
his way, he's playing the part of Sam Riegel and
being late today.

00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.968
SAM: Yeah. Clever.

00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:20.929
MATT: But he'll be here shortly. And we do not
have a Travis Willingham tonight, unfortunately,

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:27.116
he is out of town shooting something pretty
awesome, so yeah, boo indeed. Not watching

00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:28.602
Avengers this time.

00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:31.360
LAURA: That was the only time he's missed.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.353
MATT: That was the only time he's missed it, yeah.
And he was not happy. I know. He's like, why is

00:00:36.353 --> 00:00:42.939
everyone else leveling and not me yet? Nah, sorry
dude. Anyway, so we'll miss you Travis, sorry

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:49.261
you're not here. Oh, it sounds like we have a
Taliesin. Get in there, Taliesin. We have two

00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:50.527
sponsors--

00:00:50.527 --> 00:00:52.889
SAM: Wait, what, Matt? Two sponsors?

00:00:52.889 --> 00:01:01.960
MATT: What? Two sponsors. We're splitting this up,
is what we're doing. First, the new tonight-only

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.826
sponsor we have is Puzzle Quest, Magic Puzzle
Quest, actually. If you've watched any other

00:01:05.826 --> 00:01:13.166
programs this week, Me, Marisha, Liam and Taliesin
all did a show that was on Tuesday. Before Talks

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:18.172
Machina. Game the Game, with Rebecca and Ivan,
where we played it, as well as a number of other

00:01:18.172 --> 00:01:22.545
ridiculous games. But it's great, I grew up
playing Magic, it's very much a mutually--

00:01:22.545 --> 00:01:25.028
SAM: Oh, Taliesin has it on his iPad right there!

00:01:25.028 --> 00:01:31.906
MATT: There you go, and it's facing sideways. But
it's a puzzle drop game, but mixed in with the

00:01:31.906 --> 00:01:36.185
mechanics of Magic. It's free, you can check it
out, and they're being awesome, sponsoring us

00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:44.111
tonight. If you're into fantasy and that type of
three-match games, totally up your alley, and if

00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:50.190
you click on the link in chat, which is
bit.ly/criticalquest and try the game out. That's

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.563
where you can go ahead and find it. So--

00:01:51.563 --> 00:01:53.584
LIAM: You should totally play that during the
Thordak fight.

00:01:53.584 --> 00:01:57.145
TALIESIN: This is my plan, while you guys are
doing your stuff, I'm going to be playing Puzzle Quest.

00:01:57.145 --> 00:02:00.727
MATT: Oh and Taliesin, also I have left a sheet
there for your updated Cabal's Ruin.

00:02:00.727 --> 00:02:03.069
MARISHA: Yeah, we have updated stuff.

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.982
TALIESIN: Wow, you nerfed me. Okay. I'm just
kidding.

00:02:05.982 --> 00:02:11.409
MATT: No, in working on the campaign guide, and
the section about the Vestiges, while also seeing

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.006
how things played out through the game as we've
gone through, there's been a slight balance tweak

00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:18.659
to a couple of them, most in your favor. Enjoy.

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.955
TALIESIN: I think you were giving me a little bit
of this drunkenly during Westworld, if I recall.

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:24.464
MATT: I think so, actually, yeah.

00:02:24.464 --> 00:02:28.638
MARISHA: The main thing that has changed on the
Spire of Conflux is that I now gain plus one bonus

00:02:28.638 --> 00:02:32.816
to spell attack rolls and my spell save DC
increases by one.

00:02:32.816 --> 00:02:35.976
MATT: It's a benefit to you.

00:02:35.976 --> 00:02:37.115
MARISHA: Yes it is.

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:39.321
MATT: It's a benefit to anybody who uses it in
their own home campaign, it is not just specific.

00:02:39.321 --> 00:02:43.322
LAURA: And Fenthras is a plus five to attack? And
plus ten to damage rolls?

00:02:43.322 --> 00:02:46.124
LIAM: 12 hours of wings, Matt? Thank you!

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:50.973
MATT: All the Vestiges suddenly turn to dust. In
your bag. And your tears.

00:02:50.973 --> 00:02:52.969
LIAM: You have chosen poorly.

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:59.525
MATT: Exactly. So yeah! So aside from Magic Puzzle
Quest, we also have our secondary sponsor, Loot Crate!

00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:05.042
SAM: You know, guys, I always do a little fun Loot
Crate thing, but this week I'm not going to be

00:03:05.042 --> 00:03:12.715
doing the Loot Crate announcement. This week, my
new character that I've been workshopping, Brody

00:03:12.715 --> 00:03:19.306
Slater! Of Malibu, California is going to be doing
the Loot Crate ad. I've been workshopping this,

00:03:19.306 --> 00:03:23.259
I've been doing some acting coach work with it.

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.611
TALIESIN: How you never did a rhyme on SNL is
beyond me, man, I don't know how--

00:03:26.611 --> 00:03:30.217
SAM: It's a showcase for Loot Crate, but it's also
a showcase for my acting.

00:03:30.217 --> 00:03:33.268
(laughter)

00:03:33.268 --> 00:03:40.472
SAM: Let me get into character real quick. Yo surf
bros and bunnies! December can be a mondo bogus

00:03:40.472 --> 00:03:45.069
bummer! You want to lock in on a maxed out
cruncher, ride an outside breaker, shoot the curl

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.091
on an epic set, but you can't! It's too cold! The
beaches are blown out, the swells are glassy, and

00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:58.168
you feel like you're getting a sand facial, like
some gremlin poser, amirite? Well not for long!

00:03:58.168 --> 00:04:03.568
Get amped again with December's radical Loot
Crate. The primo duds'll get your heart beating

00:04:03.568 --> 00:04:08.467
like a gnarlatious double spinner, toes on the
nose! The geeky gear will make you feel like

00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:13.923
you're droppin' in on the wedge, pruning out at
Pendleton, or taking a face goofy-foot at Sano,

00:04:13.923 --> 00:04:26.426
outrageous! So don't wipe out, sign up! For Loot
Crate! At lootrate.com/criticalrole, promo code

00:04:26.426 --> 00:04:32.503
"critical role" for ten percent off your first

00:04:32.503 --> 00:04:34.419
(cheering)

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.641
MATT: That's pretty good! A little Scottish at the
end, though.

00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:42.080
TALIESIN: Somewhere in Topanga Canyon right now,
Dweezil Zappa is bleeding from the nose, going:

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.012
oh! What?! What?!

00:04:45.012 --> 00:04:47.367
LAURA: That blonde hair did something for your
complexion, though.

00:04:47.367 --> 00:04:49.170
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, you were glowing.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.670
LIAM: No wonder you're in voiceover!

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.520
SAM: I mean, we're versatile actors, and I just
want to showcase that to the people!

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.047
MATT: I hope that's a sneak peek of your character
in the next campaign, Sam.

00:04:59.047 --> 00:05:00.085
SAM: Definitely.

00:05:00.085 --> 00:05:08.976
MATT: Thank you Loot Crate, thank you Magic Puzzle
Quest-- Check 'em both out, guys. Couple quick

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:14.476
announcements! Talks Machina will be up next
Tuesday, and every following Tuesday simulcast

00:05:14.476 --> 00:05:20.124
both on Twitch and Alpha! So you guys can still
get a chance to watch it, the Alpha supporters

00:05:20.124 --> 00:05:23.937
will still have all the access to it. It's going
to be awesome, glad you guys get a chance to

00:05:23.937 --> 00:05:30.669
follow us along with that and to try out the
platform, and enjoy it on Twitch. So yay! So, next

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.171
Talks will have a couple guests, which you might
meet later on this evening, will be joining the next

00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:46.881
episode this Tuesday at 7:00pm here and on Alpha.
You're welcome, Brian. Next up! Next Monday

00:05:46.881 --> 00:05:52.315
December 12th, from 4:00pm to 6:00pm, there's an
extra special holiday season episode of Dick and

00:05:52.315 --> 00:05:55.872
Johnson happening here. Dick and Johnson Save
Everything Ultra Holiday Special-- such a specific

00:05:55.872 --> 00:06:01.268
title-- going to be a bunch of guests, including
Chloe Dykstra, myself, I will be showing up for a

00:06:01.268 --> 00:06:05.573
little bit, with some ridiculousness in
characters, so you guys need to check it out if

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:10.374
you haven't already, it's-- how do you describe
the game? It's like a shark riding a reindeer

00:06:10.374 --> 00:06:13.162
shooting a minigun, while waving an American flag
and playing D&amp;amp;D.

00:06:13.162 --> 00:06:15.878
TALIESIN: That's a great tattoo.

00:06:15.878 --> 00:06:20.831
MATT: That's a challenge to you guys. Show us your
pictures of your great amazing Dick and Johnson

00:06:20.831 --> 00:06:26.512
tattoo. Wherever it may be on your Dick and
Johnson. But tune in next Monday, December 12th,

00:06:26.512 --> 00:06:30.749
at 4:00 to 6:00pm, check it out, I'll see you
there. All right.

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:33.168
SAM: So many announcements.

00:06:33.168 --> 00:06:38.471
MATT: I know! We're getting there, we're getting
there. New GM Tips came out today!

00:06:38.471 --> 00:06:40.133
(cheering)

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:45.310
MATT: This week's topic is specifically on running
an evil campaign, and curbing modo-- herber--

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:52.493
murder herber-- murder hobo behavior in games.
Check out the good times. That's out now on

00:06:52.493 --> 00:06:59.934
YouTube and the Geek and Sundry website. Also, at
the break today, we have a very special video from

00:06:59.934 --> 00:07:05.458
our good friend Patrick Rothfuss and plays Kerr in
the world, as we're helping support his

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:09.197
Worldbuilders charity, which has been doing
amazing, gangbusters, and they're setting up a

00:07:09.197 --> 00:07:13.871
specific Critical Role page on that, with a few
prizes that we're providing from our end as well

00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:18.044
for people that enter and donate, that you can
win. So he's going to put together a video and

00:07:18.044 --> 00:07:22.777
information about the page will be available very
soon. Go check it out, it's an amazing charity,

00:07:22.777 --> 00:07:27.223
I've talked about it here before, and the money's
being matched, dollar for dollar, by a number of

00:07:27.223 --> 00:07:31.617
corporations for everything you donate. So check
out the break for a special message from Patrick

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:32.531
Rothfuss.

00:07:32.531 --> 00:07:33.880
LIAM: He's a good human being.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:39.608
MATT: He's a good man. And he wanted to be here
tonight but he's unfortunately in a-- I say

00:07:39.608 --> 00:07:45.018
unfortunately-- fortunately in a tux, at the, I
think it's the game-- what? The--

00:07:45.018 --> 00:07:46.511
TALIESIN: Gamer's Choice Awards?

00:07:46.511 --> 00:07:49.763
MATT: No no no no. Child's Play, I think, charity
event tonight.

00:07:49.763 --> 00:07:53.318
TALIESIN: It's the gamer's Shorty Awards.

00:07:53.318 --> 00:07:58.352
MATT: So the whole cha-- no, it's the charity!
It's all about charity, apparently. Speaking of

00:07:58.352 --> 00:08:06.410
charity, we have the pleasure of once again, as a
fantastic example of this community that's sprung

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:12.741
up around this channel and this show, so many of
you guys have been so generous, and supporting of

00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:17.467
all the charities we've spoken of, and other
charities you've gone on to find, we have one

00:08:17.467 --> 00:08:24.430
amazing Critter who is here tonight, named Mark
Kuro, who has donated an amazing amount to 826LA

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.914
in the name of this show--

00:08:25.914 --> 00:08:28.739
(cheering)

00:08:28.739 --> 00:08:31.785
MATT: --and you guys, so say hello to Mark
everyone. Mark, I'm blown away by your generosity,

00:08:31.785 --> 00:08:36.871
and I think it's a fantastic example once again of
the power of community that you've all put

00:08:36.871 --> 00:08:39.736
together and helping support other people who
don't have the opportunity.

00:08:39.736 --> 00:08:43.014
MARK: Well, and I also want to thank you guys for
the inspiration. I mean, you get to throw

00:08:43.014 --> 00:08:46.975
inspiration dice around all the time, but when you
do it in the real world, it makes a big

00:08:46.975 --> 00:08:52.376
difference. So I think 826LA is an amazing
charity, and I think I would do sort of a

00:08:52.376 --> 00:08:57.631
Christmas Critter Charity Challenge, for all the
Critters out there at this time of year

00:08:57.631 --> 00:09:01.831
especially, to go ahead and donate to your
favorite charity, donate to 826LA in the name of

00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:07.901
Critical Role, and again, make a difference.
World's gotten a little wonky, time for love and

00:09:07.901 --> 00:09:10.832
generosity is never better than now, so thanks
guys.

00:09:10.832 --> 00:09:13.290
MATT: I completely agree. Thank you, Mark. Really
appreciate it, thanks buddy.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.930
MARK: Kill the dragons, he's got to die!

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.984
LIAM: He said, he said, Mark said, he's got to
die. He's got to die, Matt, he's got to die.

00:09:20.984 --> 00:09:24.316
MATT: Well, you know, maybe I gave you a damage bonus, I
don't know. Thank you, Mark.

00:09:24.316 --> 00:09:30.399
MARISHA: And yeah, and as always, 826LA is
amazing, and there might be a local branch in your

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:34.000
city, I know there's one in San Francisco, I know
there's one in New York, I know there's one in

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.196
Chicago.

00:09:35.196 --> 00:09:38.303
TALIESIN: You should totally check it out, you can
also-- they have web stores, and you should go

00:09:38.303 --> 00:09:41.349
onto their web stores because there's a lot of
really good Christmas stuff that you can buy

00:09:41.349 --> 00:09:45.211
that's fun and arty and poetry-ish, and kids
poetry that you can buy books of that's actually

00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:49.295
really good, and it's a great Christmas gift, and
you're giving to a good cause. It's amazing.

00:09:49.295 --> 00:09:50.799
MARISHA: Yeah, it's amazing.

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:56.225
MATT: Hell yeah. Oh, and I forgot to mention this
too, for the Talks Machina announcement too,

00:09:56.225 --> 00:10:01.554
while it's remaining on Twitch, also they will have an
enhanced version on Alpha in the new year as well,

00:10:01.554 --> 00:10:05.252
so you'll have that positive element of it, too,
and get to see what the platform is capable of

00:10:05.252 --> 00:10:12.758
doing with that show. So. There you go. Spotify
playlists are still rolling out. We had Laura's go

00:10:12.758 --> 00:10:13.956
up last Friday.

00:10:13.956 --> 00:10:16.144
LIAM: It was so good, it was so good!

00:10:16.144 --> 00:10:17.352
LAURA: Did you think so?

00:10:17.352 --> 00:10:18.314
LIAM: I did, I liked it.

00:10:18.314 --> 00:10:20.141
LAURA: Is it maybe because you had a song on
there?

00:10:20.141 --> 00:10:22.713
LIAM: Well, that's part of it, but the whole thing
was pretty good!

00:10:22.713 --> 00:10:23.864
LAURA: Thanks, bro.

00:10:23.864 --> 00:10:25.196
SAM: It's all Debbie Gibson.

00:10:25.196 --> 00:10:26.658
LAURA: You had a song on there, too, Sam.

00:10:26.658 --> 00:10:27.414
SAM: I did?

00:10:27.414 --> 00:10:28.917
LAURA: Yeah, I know you didn't listen to it.

00:10:28.917 --> 00:10:34.078
SAM: No, I haven't. I will tonight. I'll go down
to Spotify, or Geek and Sundry, or wherever you

00:10:34.078 --> 00:10:35.267
get them, and--

00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:38.673
MARISHA: Did you ever listen to any of the first
playlists that we put out?

00:10:38.673 --> 00:10:40.262
SAM: Of course I did! I listened to mine.

00:10:40.262 --> 00:10:43.382
(laughter)

00:10:43.382 --> 00:10:47.847
LIAM: You are on a show called Critical Role,
where a group of nerdy-ass voice actors--

00:10:47.847 --> 00:10:51.718
SAM: My best friends, who I support, by showing
up!

00:10:51.718 --> 00:10:56.368
(laughter)

00:10:56.368 --> 00:11:03.589
SAM: No, I listened to them. I read your little
blurbs. I did, I did those things.

00:11:03.589 --> 00:11:09.473
LIAM: Oh, I just got the Christmas spirit all up
in my heart. Nice.

00:11:09.473 --> 00:11:12.096
TALIESIN: Let's get some seltzer, we'll get that
right out.

00:11:12.096 --> 00:11:15.670
MARISHA: Thank you for your click on the Geek and
Sundry website, I guess!

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:19.316
TALIESIN: Just a click, not a like.

00:11:19.316 --> 00:11:23.463
MATT: And, last--

00:11:23.463 --> 00:11:25.835
TALIESIN: Who is the Spotify playlist this week?

00:11:25.835 --> 00:11:26.985
MARISHA: You.

00:11:26.985 --> 00:11:28.778
TALIESIN: Oh, it's me? Oh, that's great.

00:11:28.778 --> 00:11:29.799
SAM: Have you done it yet?

00:11:29.799 --> 00:11:32.731
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know I did it, I did do it--
It's good, it's good music.

00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:36.521
LIAM: Sam will listen to it in five months.

00:11:36.521 --> 00:11:43.084
MATT: Last but not least, me and Marisha are
guesting at MagFest in January, 6th to the 8th,

00:11:43.084 --> 00:11:47.713
MagFest is one of my favorite events and has been
for many years, it's a video-game music festival.

00:11:47.713 --> 00:11:52.144
We're going to have a bunch of panels over there,
and there's a bunch of great concerts and shows

00:11:52.144 --> 00:11:56.040
going on, it's a general awesome, fun experience.
If you haven't been before, I recommend it, if you

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.507
have been, go again! We'll be there. Come and say
hi.

00:11:58.507 --> 00:12:00.106
LAURA: There's also a couple more announcements.

00:12:00.106 --> 00:12:02.510
SAM: More and more and more and more.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:09.369
LAURA: I know, I know, but these are good. Well,
last weekend was PSX and there were a couple

00:12:09.369 --> 00:12:15.990
awesome projects that were announced there, which
is the new Uncharted game! The Lost Legacy! What

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.264
what what! I play Nadine, what what what!

00:12:18.264 --> 00:12:19.706
(cheering)

00:12:19.706 --> 00:12:24.349
LAURA: And then, also announced at the same time,
was Last of Us 2, starring one Ashley Johnson, so

00:12:24.349 --> 00:12:27.091
we're all very very very excited about it--

00:12:27.091 --> 00:12:30.462
MATT: Our D&amp;amp;D show book-ended PSX, that's cool,
actually.

00:12:30.462 --> 00:12:33.116
LAURA: Yeah, it was pretty frickin' cool. And
those are going to be a long time before they're

00:12:33.116 --> 00:12:38.729
out, but you know, it's still really awesome. And
then! Finishing announcements tonight with some

00:12:38.729 --> 00:12:41.425
special, special treats, which is--

00:12:41.425 --> 00:12:46.427
MATT: I haven't even seen that.

00:12:46.427 --> 00:12:49.596
LAURA: A Critical Role hat. Yeah, you've been in
here the whole time. This is out, in the store,

00:12:49.596 --> 00:12:59.364
right now, as well as Critical Role dice! So, I
have heard tell that if you get these ordered-- if

00:12:59.364 --> 00:13:02.716
you live in the United States, at least, I'm sorry
international Critters-- but if you live in the US

00:13:02.716 --> 00:13:04.780
then you should be able to get these before
Christmas!

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.819
MARISHA: Yay! Stocking stuffers.

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:09.682
LAURA: Yeah, great stocking stuffers, great under
the tree presents too.

00:13:09.682 --> 00:13:13.762
LIAM: This is a fine-ass baseball cap. On the
inside it says: How Do You Want To Do This? Oh,

00:13:13.892 --> 00:13:16.906
and your head is so small, and my head is so
large.

00:13:16.906 --> 00:13:18.758
MARISHA: And it's all embroidered.

00:13:18.758 --> 00:13:26.308
SAM: And it's perfect for when we play all the
other Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Twitch shows in our

00:13:26.308 --> 00:13:27.647
softball league!

00:13:27.647 --> 00:13:36.865
LAURA: Right? So we have a certain amount. And I
by the way rolled these dice, before the show, and

00:13:36.865 --> 00:13:38.951
I got a critical on my d20, so--

00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:41.392
MATT: No guarantee.

00:13:41.392 --> 00:13:46.625
LAURA: They're in the store right now. There's a
limited amount, obviously, like it always is, but!

00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:49.398
As soon as they're gone we're going to order more.
But if you want 'em for Christmas, then you know,

00:13:49.398 --> 00:13:51.220
probably get them soon.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:58.863
MATT: All righty. I think that's it, right? Okay,
good. Wow. Front-loaded them this week. Thank you

00:13:58.863 --> 00:14:03.306
for your patience, guys. It's all good! Good
announcements. Good things. Good holiday spirit

00:14:03.306 --> 00:14:08.298
kicking forward. And in that same spirit of good
positive fun, let's bring it down here into the

00:14:08.298 --> 00:14:16.451
current dramatic, rocketing conclusion of the
Chroma Conclave, for tonight's episode of Critical Role!

00:14:16.451 --> 00:15:50.278
[dramatic music]

00:15:50.278 --> 00:15:53.385
MATT: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.

00:15:53.385 --> 00:15:55.493
SAM: A lot happened. A lot happened in that
break.

00:15:55.493 --> 00:15:57.394
MATT: Apparently! I missed most of it.

00:15:57.394 --> 00:15:58.725
LAURA: Pure chaos.

00:15:58.725 --> 00:16:02.345
MATT: I'm so removed from most events at the
table before the game starts, I'm like: what

00:16:02.647 --> 00:16:03.887
happened? What?

00:16:03.887 --> 00:16:06.021
TALIESIN: Do you phase out so you don't hear the
terrible things we say?

00:16:06.021 --> 00:16:10.333
MATT: No, I'm focused on the rest of the shit
that's happening tonight. Anyway. So, to get you

00:16:10.333 --> 00:16:15.329
up to speed, our fantastic band of adventurers,
Vox Machina, had been battling against the Chroma

00:16:15.329 --> 00:16:20.181
Conclave, a collection of evil, dangerous
chromatic dragons, led by Thordak, the Cinder

00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:25.656
King, who has been reigning over their home city
of Emon for quite some time, terrorising the

00:16:25.656 --> 00:16:32.413
community, and apparently slowly undergoing a
change based on the elemental stone that is

00:16:32.413 --> 00:16:38.143
embedded in his body that once locked him into the
Plane of Fire. You've defeated most of the

00:16:38.143 --> 00:16:44.931
dragons, and allied yourself with one of the only
remaining members, Raishan, the green dragon. You

00:16:44.931 --> 00:16:49.643
guys have since acquired a number of allies, you
made your way to the Fire Plane to the City of

00:16:49.643 --> 00:16:55.227
Brass, you returned to find Fort Daxio under
attack. You managed to defend it, you saved a few

00:16:55.227 --> 00:16:59.039
friends, returned to Whitestone, and it seems like
everything is gearing itself towards the final

00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:05.940
conflict in Emon, with Thordak the Cinder King.
Last we left off, you were meeting underneath

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:10.645
Whitestone at the ziggurat, with the current
standing council, the War Council, of both

00:17:10.645 --> 00:17:18.699
Whitestone and this entire endeavor. You decided a
couple of people to come with you, and now is your

00:17:18.699 --> 00:17:26.526
time to spend the next day or so wisely, as the
army from Fort Daxio and Syngorn will be arriving

00:17:26.526 --> 00:17:33.515
at Emon by about sundown the following day. Your
airship was in transit to Daxio, and has been

00:17:33.515 --> 00:17:37.737
rerouted to Emon as well. Everyone is converging
to the city. What do you want to do to prepare?

00:17:37.737 --> 00:17:39.654
LAURA: Oh god, it's all happening!

00:17:39.654 --> 00:17:41.237
MARISHA: Okay. They're all going to the city.

00:17:41.237 --> 00:17:43.284
LAURA: So, what time of day is it right now?

00:17:43.284 --> 00:17:46.755
MATT: Right now, I'd say about mid-afternoon.

00:17:46.755 --> 00:17:49.284
MARISHA: Are we still down by the ziggurat?

00:17:49.284 --> 00:17:53.823
MATT: Yeah, you guys just finished your meeting at
the ziggurat.

00:17:53.823 --> 00:18:01.159
TALIESIN: I have some guns to repair, because
everything broke, and many of these things cost

00:18:01.159 --> 00:18:02.323
money now.

00:18:02.323 --> 00:18:03.219
MATT: Yeah.

00:18:03.219 --> 00:18:05.704
SAM: That's small picture. We're big picture.

00:18:05.704 --> 00:18:12.574
LIAM: How long is the trip, did we say? To get to
Emon from here.

00:18:12.574 --> 00:18:14.589
SAM: Instant for us.

00:18:14.589 --> 00:18:16.591
LAURA: Well, we have to go through a tree.

00:18:16.591 --> 00:18:19.194
SAM: Or a teleportation circle.

00:18:19.194 --> 00:18:21.748
LIAM: Then we're meeting with Dad?

00:18:21.748 --> 00:18:24.936
LAURA: Yeah, he's marching to Emon right now.

00:18:24.936 --> 00:18:31.809
MARISHA: Are we going to have a meeting spot
outside of Emon? We should probably have a plan.

00:18:31.809 --> 00:18:37.189
TALIESIN: We should probably get close to
Greyskull and see if we can enter through the

00:18:37.189 --> 00:18:38.169
tunnels.

00:18:38.169 --> 00:18:39.652
LIAM: I think that's our way, yeah.

00:18:39.652 --> 00:18:46.825
SAM: Yes, but we do have to rally with your pops,
and also didn't we cut loose 55 soldiers to wander

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:48.605
free in the desert from Daxio?

00:18:48.605 --> 00:18:51.892
LAURA: They're meeting the other armies.

00:18:51.892 --> 00:18:53.837
SAM: They're just going to form up?

00:18:53.837 --> 00:18:55.461
LAURA: Trust in them. They're soldiers, they'll be
able to find their way.

00:18:55.461 --> 00:18:59.028
SAM: Right. But can we scry and figure out where
this other army is? Maybe we'll go there? Or maybe

00:18:59.028 --> 00:19:03.382
we should scry on our old keep and go there. Those
seem like two good locations.

00:19:03.382 --> 00:19:08.168
TALIESIN: I think scrying on the old keep and then
letting everyone know-- we don't necessarily want

00:19:08.168 --> 00:19:12.582
everyone arriving at the same place as well, as
long as there's a coordinated movement towards the city.

00:19:12.582 --> 00:19:16.360
LAURA: They can all start attacking and we can
come in from the bottom.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:22.122
SAM: Sure, but we've told the approaching army
nothing about any plan whatsoever.

00:19:22.122 --> 00:19:24.240
TALIESIN: We can call them if we need to.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:30.899
MARISHA: So we probably want different regiments
flanking the city in different areas?

00:19:30.899 --> 00:19:35.611
TALIESIN: And then maybe the 50 men coming into
the sewers to fight.

00:19:35.611 --> 00:19:39.134
LIAM: I feel like we want to catch up with our
father's army before they're anywhere near the

00:19:39.134 --> 00:19:43.418
walls of the city, because, well, that'd be
stupid.

00:19:43.418 --> 00:19:45.840
TALIESIN: We can go meet them if that's the next
move.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:51.470
SAM: And strategize when we get there? Once we see
their forces, and what they have to offer?

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:54.497
MARISHA: Percy, do you still have that map of
Emon?

00:19:54.497 --> 00:19:57.939
TALIESIN: Yes, somewhere.

00:19:57.939 --> 00:20:02.996
LAURA: We should probably talk to Gilmore as well,
and let him know that he has to fucking join us.

00:20:02.996 --> 00:20:07.467
MARISHA: That he drew the short straw. We
drew the short straw for him.

00:20:07.467 --> 00:20:11.586
TALIESIN: We should also collect some other
allies, if we're going to head in this direction.

00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:13.533
LAURA: Of course.

00:20:13.559 --> 00:20:17.352
SAM: All right. Do you want to go talk to Gilmore,
Vaxy-poo?

00:20:17.352 --> 00:20:21.612
TALIESIN: We're going to need a painter, you know
a painter, we should bring a painter with us.

00:20:21.612 --> 00:20:23.159
SAM: A painter? To paint our exploits?

00:20:23.159 --> 00:20:25.448
TALIESIN: Yes, to paint our exploits. You have
that portrait--

00:20:25.448 --> 00:20:28.178
MARISHA: Once again, Percy, I feel like that's
small picture--

00:20:28.178 --> 00:20:30.246
TALIESIN: Is it small potatoes? Is it really,
though?

00:20:30.246 --> 00:20:34.670
LIAM: We could find a jeweller right now. If
that's what you're into.

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:41.948
SAM: I have a man at a casino that I really need
to get revenge on.

00:20:41.948 --> 00:20:45.250
TALIESIN: You might as well get it all done now,
because you're not going to be able to do it later.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.080
MARISHA: 24 hours left alive!

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.506
LIAM: Kynan? Kynan!

00:20:48.506 --> 00:20:50.894
SAM: All right.

00:20:50.894 --> 00:20:55.884
TALIESIN: But no, stock up on what-- again,
Whitestone doesn't necessarily have a lot for us

00:20:55.884 --> 00:20:57.498
to gather--

00:20:57.498 --> 00:21:00.902
SAM: But we should bring any potions. How we doing
on potions? Did you ever divvy up our last several

00:21:00.902 --> 00:21:01.782
potions?

00:21:01.782 --> 00:21:04.900
LAURA: I did divvy up our last potions, I feel
like it might be smart to get some more, but the

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.758
only place to really buy any is Vasselheim.

00:21:06.758 --> 00:21:07.907
SAM: Is that true?

00:21:07.907 --> 00:21:14.944
LAURA: I mean it's the only city still standing
that we have access to immediately. We don't have

00:21:14.944 --> 00:21:21.446
a lot of time. The thing is, I feel like people in
Vasselheim said they would help us, but I don't

00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:24.222
know how they'd get to Emon to help us in time.

00:21:24.222 --> 00:21:28.687
SAM: I know, an airship! Oh shit, where's our
airship?

00:21:28.687 --> 00:21:30.102
LAURA: It's on its way.

00:21:30.102 --> 00:21:31.532
SAM: To where?

00:21:31.532 --> 00:21:32.841
LIAM: Emon. To Emon.

00:21:32.841 --> 00:21:35.479
SAM: Did we say Emon, or did we say Daxio?

00:21:35.479 --> 00:21:38.049
MATT: It was on its way to Daxio--

00:21:38.049 --> 00:21:40.058
MARISHA: They're redirecting to Emon.

00:21:40.058 --> 00:21:44.526
SAM: Thank God. We're sending it to a dragon instead
of a fort on fire.

00:21:44.526 --> 00:21:47.918
TALIESIN: It does have weaponry.

00:21:47.918 --> 00:21:50.383
LAURA: Yeah. It's made to take on things attacking
it.

00:21:50.383 --> 00:21:52.282
TALIESIN: It's designed to help keep him on the
ground.

00:21:52.282 --> 00:21:55.241
MARISHA: Uh-huh, yeah, it's a giant balloon in the
air--

00:21:55.241 --> 00:21:56.744
LAURA: It's not a balloon, actually--

00:21:56.744 --> 00:22:01.115
TALIESIN: Well, no, it's a giant crystal. It's-- I
know I keep saying--

00:22:01.115 --> 00:22:04.412
MARISHA: I always think of it as a high-tech
Hindenberg.

00:22:04.458 --> 00:22:07.122
TALIESIN: I know. Please don't say that. That's
not funny.

00:22:07.122 --> 00:22:09.169
LIAM: That's a metaphor for Vox Machina.

00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:11.594
MATT: There you go. If there ever was one, yeah.

00:22:11.594 --> 00:22:18.684
SAM: All right. Besides gathering our forces here,
gathering our potions here, and telling Gilmore,

00:22:18.684 --> 00:22:24.299
where are we going? Let's put it to a vote, as we
always do, democratically. Grog?

00:22:24.299 --> 00:22:26.371
MATT: "Yes?"

00:22:26.371 --> 00:22:34.517
SAM: Grog, where would you like to go? To the army
waiting just outside of Emon, or to our old ratty

00:22:34.517 --> 00:22:36.183
keep with nothing in it?

00:22:36.183 --> 00:22:38.364
TALIESIN: "I'd like to go to the--" I don't know.

00:22:38.364 --> 00:22:39.963
LAURA: I don't know what he wants.

00:22:39.963 --> 00:22:41.677
MATT: Percy's getting a little strange off to the
side.

00:22:41.677 --> 00:22:50.640
LAURA: Wait, Travis is watching, so he can just
text in, yeah. Grog is thinking about it. Grog is

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.857
thinking really hard.

00:22:51.857 --> 00:22:57.938
MATT: He considers it for a second and goes,
"Whatever makes me kill things faster."

00:22:57.938 --> 00:22:59.231
LAURA: That's good.

00:22:59.231 --> 00:23:01.532
MARISHA: Wait, have we rested?

00:23:01.532 --> 00:23:06.021
MATT: You did rest before coming here. You spent
the evening in Fort Daxio.

00:23:06.021 --> 00:23:08.597
MARISHA: And then we teleported. No, Allura
brought us here.

00:23:08.597 --> 00:23:17.994
SAM: Okay, putting it to a vote. Three choices.
Ready? To your dad, to our keep, or to Vasselheim.

00:23:17.994 --> 00:23:20.576
I don't know why, but it's been mentioned.

00:23:20.576 --> 00:23:23.629
MARISHA: Hang on, I can scry on our keep.

00:23:23.629 --> 00:23:31.427
LAURA: Can't Allura send a message to them and let
them know what our plan is, and then we don't have

00:23:31.427 --> 00:23:33.033
to actually bamf there?

00:23:33.033 --> 00:23:34.682
SAM: We don't have a plan!

00:23:34.682 --> 00:23:38.481
TALIESIN: Wherever we go, we can let everyone know
what the plan and where we're going is.

00:23:38.481 --> 00:23:44.835
LAURA: I feel like what we need to do-- okay,
here's what I think our plan should be.

00:23:44.835 --> 00:23:47.007
SAM: Lead us, O Mighty Vex.

00:23:47.007 --> 00:23:54.688
LAURA: I feel like we should tell the armies
gathering to prepare to attack. We enter in where

00:23:54.688 --> 00:23:56.506
the Clasp is; we come in from the bottom up.

00:23:56.506 --> 00:24:00.174
SAM: So they're going to create a diversion for
us?

00:24:00.174 --> 00:24:04.119
LAURA: Exactly. They take on the armies while we
head straight to Thordak.

00:24:04.119 --> 00:24:07.989
LIAM: Dad creates a shit-storm at the wall, and we
take advantage of that chaos.

00:24:07.989 --> 00:24:09.430
SAM: We have to communicate this to them.

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.642
TALIESIN: Easy to do. We just send a message.

00:24:11.642 --> 00:24:15.129
LAURA: We could send a message, or we could bamf
there and then bamf another place. It seems a lot

00:24:15.129 --> 00:24:16.669
of time wasted.

00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:18.239
TALIESIN: Yeah, easier just to send a message.

00:24:18.239 --> 00:24:23.517
MATT: Allura has been in communication and has
been the information hub between most of these

00:24:23.517 --> 00:24:24.782
individuals.

00:24:24.782 --> 00:24:29.222
LIAM: How long did we say before Syldor reaches
Emon?

00:24:29.222 --> 00:24:31.790
MATT: By about dusk the following day.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:36.095
LIAM: Dusk the following day. And you said
afternoon right now? So a little more than 24 hours.

00:24:36.095 --> 00:24:40.412
TALIESIN: We can at least get into there and start
communicating with the Clasp.

00:24:40.412 --> 00:24:43.619
MARISHA: We're not really in good standing with
them.

00:24:43.619 --> 00:24:46.516
TALIESIN: I'm sure they'll be happy to see us,
regardless.

00:24:46.516 --> 00:24:53.276
MARISHA: You think? I guess. Sure. It's like
seeing that person you hated in high school after

00:24:53.276 --> 00:24:57.541
something terrible just happened. Happy for the
familiarity.

00:24:57.541 --> 00:25:01.329
SAM: But now they're a little bit overweight and
they work in an Applebee's.

00:25:01.329 --> 00:25:02.752
MARISHA: Sure, and it's a little gratifying?

00:25:02.752 --> 00:25:03.949
SAM: Yeah.

00:25:03.949 --> 00:25:08.786
LIAM: They can hate us, and we can deal with that
afterward, if there is even an afterward.

00:25:08.786 --> 00:25:11.270
TALIESIN: They're businessmen; I doubt they hold
grudges.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.541
LAURA: I'm sure they hold grudges.

00:25:13.541 --> 00:25:15.654
TALIESIN: Not until after the dragon's been taken
care of.

00:25:15.654 --> 00:25:16.976
LAURA: Then they'll make us pay?

00:25:16.976 --> 00:25:20.396
TALIESIN: Yes. It's not profitable to kill us
before the dragon is dead.

00:25:20.396 --> 00:25:28.288
LIAM: Also, somewhere in all this fracas, we need
you to take care of us with food.

00:25:28.288 --> 00:25:30.531
TALIESIN: When it's time.

00:25:30.531 --> 00:25:32.845
LIAM: Right, when is the time?

00:25:32.845 --> 00:25:35.139
TALIESIN: I think once we're there.

00:25:35.139 --> 00:25:36.576
MARISHA: It lasts for 24 hours.

00:25:36.576 --> 00:25:38.706
LAURA: Before we head in.

00:25:38.706 --> 00:25:41.541
LIAM: In the keep, for old time's sake?

00:25:41.541 --> 00:25:43.472
LAURA: I don't think that's very smart.

00:25:43.472 --> 00:25:45.830
TALIESIN: Or in the sewers, for old time's sake.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.512
(laughter)

00:25:48.512 --> 00:25:50.752
LIAM: I mean underneath.

00:25:50.752 --> 00:25:54.413
TALIESIN: Hopefully, in the keep.

00:25:54.413 --> 00:25:56.051
SAM: So we have a clear plan, then?

00:25:56.051 --> 00:25:57.906
TALIESIN: We have a plan for dinner.

00:25:57.906 --> 00:26:00.507
LIAM: There's no guarantees, Scanlan.

00:26:00.507 --> 00:26:04.163
SAM: Where are we going? That's all I care about
right now.

00:26:04.163 --> 00:26:08.879
LIAM: We're going to hell. Where do you think
we're going? It's going to be fucking awful.

00:26:08.879 --> 00:26:10.815
You're probably going to be dead in 48 hours.

00:26:10.815 --> 00:26:14.627
SAM: Yeah, but we'll be together, and I don't
think that I'll die.

00:26:14.627 --> 00:26:16.147
LIAM: You're adorable.

00:26:16.147 --> 00:26:19.043
TALIESIN: You're going to be in front, if
anything.

00:26:19.043 --> 00:26:21.792
MARISHA: This is the worst of two extremes.

00:26:21.792 --> 00:26:24.791
TALIESIN: You should scry on Greyskull.

00:26:24.791 --> 00:26:26.634
MARISHA: Is anyone still there?

00:26:26.634 --> 00:26:32.065
SAM: Last time I looked in, there was some
movement, or it looked like people had recently

00:26:32.065 --> 00:26:33.169
been there.

00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:36.908
MARISHA: Wasn't it Drexel? Dranzel?

00:26:36.908 --> 00:26:38.962
SAM: Nope, they're off somewhere else.

00:26:38.962 --> 00:26:46.381
LAURA: You said by sunset tomorrow is when they'll
be at Emon?

00:26:46.381 --> 00:26:50.221
MATT: That's when they'll be there and ready.

00:26:50.221 --> 00:26:51.692
LAURA: Okay.

00:26:51.692 --> 00:26:58.071
MATT: If you want more information, you might have
to talk to somebody who has that information.

00:26:58.071 --> 00:27:03.381
LAURA: Right. What we need to do is plan a time
that they start the attack.

00:27:03.381 --> 00:27:11.068
SAM: Sure. We've got to get there first and suss
it out, too. We haven't done any recon. This army

00:27:11.068 --> 00:27:16.405
of your father's, we have no idea how big it is,
if they have archers, if they have an elite SWAT

00:27:16.405 --> 00:27:17.966
team task force--

00:27:17.966 --> 00:27:20.275
TALIESIN: How do you feel that will affect our
plan?

00:27:20.275 --> 00:27:24.445
SAM: If we know we have an elite SWAT team task
force, we can take them down with us into the

00:27:24.445 --> 00:27:25.390
sewers!

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:28.536
TALIESIN: I can almost promise you they do not
have an elite SWAT team task force.

00:27:28.536 --> 00:27:31.643
LAURA: They might have some stealthy--

00:27:31.643 --> 00:27:33.198
TALIESIN: Some stealthy individuals.

00:27:33.198 --> 00:27:34.924
MARISHA: We have friends of our own.

00:27:34.924 --> 00:27:41.023
SAM: Also, if we do any recon, we might know that
oh, there's a big thing we need to have taken out

00:27:41.023 --> 00:27:45.313
before we can even get in. What if our keep is
being surrounded?

00:27:45.313 --> 00:27:50.603
MARISHA: Okay. Hang on. Let me scry on the keep.
This will answer plenty of questions, and then

00:27:50.603 --> 00:27:51.687
we'll go from there.

00:27:51.687 --> 00:27:52.908
LAURA: Scry away, Keyleth.

00:27:52.908 --> 00:28:01.331
MARISHA: Did we leave Laina there? Did we leave
anyone there, or is it completely vacated?

00:28:01.331 --> 00:28:04.590
LIAM: It was chaos when we left.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:09.105
MATT: Yeah, it was absolute chaos. You pushed your
servants through. Your staff still currently

00:28:09.105 --> 00:28:10.773
exists somewhere in Whitestone.

00:28:10.773 --> 00:28:13.576
MARISHA: I can't scry on a building, correct?

00:28:13.576 --> 00:28:14.796
MATT: Correct.

00:28:14.796 --> 00:28:17.358
LIAM: We fought Vorugal and then high-tailed it
out of there; inside and gone.

00:28:17.358 --> 00:28:19.868
MARISHA: I can't scry on a building.

00:28:19.868 --> 00:28:21.317
TALIESIN: Can you scry on a plant?

00:28:21.317 --> 00:28:22.872
SAM: Can you scry on a dead thing?

00:28:22.872 --> 00:28:24.779
MARISHA: Can I scry on a plant?

00:28:24.779 --> 00:28:28.436
TALIESIN: There is a tree.

00:28:28.436 --> 00:28:33.117
MATT: Because you are a druid, being a
nature-based entity and it is a living

00:28:33.117 --> 00:28:34.672
creature...

00:28:34.672 --> 00:28:37.555
(laughter)

00:28:37.555 --> 00:28:39.624
MATT: Don't steal my thunder!

00:28:39.624 --> 00:28:42.292
MARISHA: One that I've had personal communications
with.

00:28:42.292 --> 00:28:48.735
MATT: I would say, due to the fact that you are a
druid and nature is your basis, if it is a

00:28:48.735 --> 00:28:51.817
specific plant-based entity that you are very
familiar with, sure.

00:28:51.817 --> 00:28:53.618
SAM: Do we have anything like that at our keep?

00:28:53.618 --> 00:29:00.386
MATT: You have a number of trees in the front; you
have the garden that you built in Sarenrae's

00:29:00.386 --> 00:29:01.462
temple.

00:29:01.462 --> 00:29:03.854
MARISHA: That's what I want to scry on. I want to
start there.

00:29:03.854 --> 00:29:04.806
MATT: Okay.

00:29:04.806 --> 00:29:08.743
MARISHA: You know how it's always, "you zoom in
really fast, and you zoom in really fast--" Can I

00:29:08.743 --> 00:29:10.698
slow down?

00:29:10.698 --> 00:29:15.227
MATT: It doesn't work that way.

00:29:15.227 --> 00:29:18.003
MARISHA: I can't pull focus?

00:29:18.003 --> 00:29:25.179
MATT: In theory, scrying is only supposed to show
you what's there. I narratively let a little bit

00:29:25.179 --> 00:29:27.649
of a journey happen. You can't control the
journey, sorry.

00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:28.934
SAM: DVR it.

00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:32.526
MARISHA: It's the worst. Okay.

00:29:32.526 --> 00:29:37.546
MATT: All right, so where are you doing the
spell?

00:29:37.546 --> 00:29:39.100
MARISHA: Where?

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.943
MATT: Where are you doing your Scry ritual?

00:29:40.943 --> 00:29:43.396
MARISHA: Not near the ziggurat, if we're still
there.

00:29:43.396 --> 00:29:45.513
MATT: Right, so are you guys heading back to the
castle, then?

00:29:45.513 --> 00:29:46.914
LAURA: Yeah, let's go to the castle.

00:29:46.914 --> 00:29:54.912
MATT: While you guys are heading back to the
castle from underneath the tunnels, you are

00:29:54.912 --> 00:30:04.284
briefly headed off by a familiar dwarven fellow in
robes and a crystalline staff: Elementalist Drake

00:30:04.284 --> 00:30:13.249
Thunderbrand. "By the way, before you leave, we've
been working on a few things for you. They should

00:30:13.249 --> 00:30:17.631
"be of assistance to you. Come find me in the
common room whenever you're ready."

00:30:17.631 --> 00:30:22.096
SAM: Yeah, sure. Wow, fortuitous.

00:30:22.096 --> 00:30:23.355
MARISHA: I like presents.

00:30:23.355 --> 00:30:33.557
MATT: You head to your quarters to do the Scry
spell? Okay. Your vision clarifies on dark clouds.

00:30:33.557 --> 00:30:42.968
Your vision sees a gathering of grayish mists, and
you slowly transition through them to see shapes

00:30:42.968 --> 00:30:51.812
that are either extremely small or extremely
distant. Your vision begins to funnel through it

00:30:51.812 --> 00:30:55.153
quickly, like you're passing over the edge of a
waterfall.

00:30:55.153 --> 00:31:01.246
There's a rush, and you see, as the clouds
dissipate, a glimpse of the overhead of Emon. You

00:31:01.246 --> 00:31:09.161
see the once-gleaming city of white across the
Bladeshimmer Shoreline pockmarked with black and

00:31:09.161 --> 00:31:17.816
tall towers of curling black smoke. You see flames
that still burn unfettered, unstopped throughout

00:31:17.816 --> 00:31:25.521
the town, and what looks from the distance like
small clouds of gnats or flies that you realize

00:31:25.521 --> 00:31:32.027
are much larger flying entities doing small passes
over various neighborhoods to keep watch or find food.

00:31:32.027 --> 00:31:38.847
Your vision jumps again, this time careening down
even faster. Below, you can see, from an overhead

00:31:38.847 --> 00:31:46.108
view, Greyskull Keep. You begin to rush in that
direction, and as it gets closer, you can see the

00:31:46.108 --> 00:31:51.371
same damage it took from the wall from the initial
attack of the Conclave. You see elements of rubble

00:31:51.371 --> 00:31:57.237
around the outside, though it's still pristine,
being repaired by the celestial entity that was

00:31:57.237 --> 00:31:59.865
summoned by Pike shortly after.

00:31:59.865 --> 00:32:06.767
Your vision jumps again, this time through the
repaired stained-glass exterior of the temple of

00:32:06.767 --> 00:32:13.114
Sarenrae, and it comes to rest there in a moment,
amongst the strangely contrasting, peaceful

00:32:13.114 --> 00:32:20.570
greenery of this temple. There's such a sense of
hopelessness and horror on the outside of the

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:25.525
city, this one little moment of time here is
almost like a time capsule of how things were

00:32:25.525 --> 00:32:28.633
before. It's sad, but hopeful at the same time.

00:32:28.633 --> 00:32:36.027
As your vision swivels over to the tree, there in
the temple, while contained here for as long as

00:32:36.027 --> 00:32:45.132
it's been, it seems to be healthy. Looking in the
vicinity, most everything seems in place.

00:32:45.132 --> 00:32:49.572
MARISHA: Do the trees look overgrown? Do the
plants look overgrown?

00:32:49.572 --> 00:32:56.024
MATT: As much as being away for the handful of
months that you have been. They look like they

00:32:56.024 --> 00:32:58.671
haven't been trimmed or tended to recently.

00:32:58.671 --> 00:33:04.140
MARISHA: And the temple is intact? It looks like
the keep is still intact from where we rebuilt it?

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:07.428
MATT: Correct. It has not fallen.

00:33:07.428 --> 00:33:09.690
MARISHA: Do I sense any movement?

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:14.177
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage
through your Scry spell.

00:33:14.177 --> 00:33:19.330
TALIESIN: No, I can't help. Yeah, no.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:27.209
MARISHA: I rolled two ones. Both ones. I'll say
that's just flushing it out.

00:33:27.209 --> 00:33:33.164
MATT: Strangely, somehow through a Scry spell,
something got in your eye in the temple.

00:33:33.164 --> 00:33:37.617
MARISHA: I hate it when the VR goggles short out.

00:33:37.617 --> 00:33:40.661
(laughter)

00:33:40.661 --> 00:33:46.573
MATT: You don't know if it's divine energy
interference or what, but it stings a lot, and you

00:33:46.573 --> 00:33:51.881
feel the essence of the spell begin to shiver and
quake, and as you try and clear your vision

00:33:51.881 --> 00:33:53.626
through, it remains blurred.

00:33:53.626 --> 00:33:55.212
MARISHA: Shit.

00:33:55.212 --> 00:34:01.779
MATT: You're still there; your presence is there,
but you don't have the capability of seeing

00:34:01.779 --> 00:34:06.837
anything beyond the tree you're focused on. The
Scry spell is focused on the tree, and everything

00:34:06.837 --> 00:34:12.636
around it has this hazy fog-of-war feel about five
feet beyond it.

00:34:12.636 --> 00:34:16.389
SAM: Good scry.

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:18.417
MARISHA: Good scry, guys. Good scry.

00:34:18.417 --> 00:34:24.004
LAURA: What did you see? Anything good? Are we
safe?

00:34:24.004 --> 00:34:35.733
MARISHA: It's still standing, for the most part. I
saw Pike's-- wait, her celestial being wasn't

00:34:35.733 --> 00:34:36.930
still there.

00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:41.115
MATT: No, it was temporarily summoned for the
reconstruction of the ceiling portion.

00:34:41.115 --> 00:34:44.466
MARISHA: Looks okay. Looks like home.

00:34:44.466 --> 00:34:46.526
LIAM: Still standing? There wasn't anybody around
it?

00:34:46.526 --> 00:34:48.161
MARISHA: I couldn't tell.

00:34:48.161 --> 00:34:50.527
SAM: How's my comic book collection? Is it still
there?

00:34:50.527 --> 00:34:52.264
MARISHA: Burned.

00:34:52.264 --> 00:34:54.030
TALIESIN: Mint in box.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.364
LIAM: That's as close to a guarantee as we're
going to get.

00:34:57.364 --> 00:34:59.121
MARISHA: I told you to get a fire box.

00:34:59.121 --> 00:35:01.239
LAURA: Do you think Drake would join us?

00:35:01.239 --> 00:35:06.715
SAM: Who? Little guy? I'd like to be the shortest
on this trip, please.

00:35:06.715 --> 00:35:07.826
LAURA: Got it.

00:35:07.826 --> 00:35:09.054
LIAM: You are.

00:35:09.054 --> 00:35:10.480
SAM: Oh.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.223
MARISHA: Where's Kash?

00:35:13.223 --> 00:35:14.844
LAURA: And Zahra?

00:35:14.844 --> 00:35:18.518
MARISHA: Kash was really mad at us last time we
talked to him.

00:35:18.518 --> 00:35:20.054
LAURA: So maybe we shouldn't ask him.

00:35:20.054 --> 00:35:21.392
TALIESIN: Let's not.

00:35:21.392 --> 00:35:23.887
MARISHA: I talked to him last time.

00:35:23.887 --> 00:35:27.980
LAURA: I don't even want Kash to come. I don't
even want him around.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:33.535
SAM: When we walk near his residence, let's walk
around.

00:35:33.535 --> 00:35:36.948
LIAM: That guy is a badass motherfucker, and we do
want him.

00:35:36.948 --> 00:35:40.535
SAM: I know why &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; want him to come.

00:35:40.535 --> 00:35:42.133
LIAM: Well, he's got those brown eyes.

00:35:42.133 --> 00:35:44.751
LAURA: No, he's got one brown eye and one blue
eye, I think.

00:35:44.751 --> 00:35:48.606
TALIESIN: We are this loopy because we're
genuinely terrified, and we're doing everything

00:35:48.606 --> 00:35:50.544
we can not to go.

00:35:50.544 --> 00:35:52.287
LIAM: It's called gallows humor.

00:35:52.287 --> 00:35:55.300
LAURA: I'm going to go ask Zahra if she'll join
us. Can I go talk to Zahra?

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.516
MATT: Sure.

00:35:56.516 --> 00:35:58.804
LIAM: I'll go find Shaun, after her.

00:35:58.804 --> 00:36:03.201
MARISHA: You guys are forcing me into going and
talking to Kash, aren't you?

00:36:03.201 --> 00:36:05.284
LAURA: Scanlan can ask him. It doesn't have to be
you.

00:36:05.284 --> 00:36:06.528
MARISHA: Scanlan?

00:36:06.528 --> 00:36:09.430
SAM: Would you prefer me to go? We do have a
rapport.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:12.897
LAURA: I do want to ask Jarett to come too,
though.

00:36:12.897 --> 00:36:14.917
SAM: Oh, I need to go see Jarett.

00:36:14.917 --> 00:36:20.542
(laughter)

00:36:20.542 --> 00:36:24.263
SAM: You're on Kash duty, Kiki.

00:36:24.263 --> 00:36:26.838
LIAM: Scanlan, do you need a little resolve for
this fight?

00:36:26.838 --> 00:36:35.256
SAM: I just want to see Jarett. He's our most
solid ally, and most dependable friend.

00:36:35.256 --> 00:36:37.069
LIAM: There's no other reason?

00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:39.807
SAM: He's been there for us in our time of need.

00:36:39.807 --> 00:36:41.557
LIAM: Still no other reason?

00:36:41.557 --> 00:36:45.004
SAM: I feel like it would be a big pick-me-up to
see him.

00:36:45.004 --> 00:36:48.400
(laughter)

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.818
LIAM: Solid. You do that.

00:36:50.818 --> 00:36:58.254
TALIESIN: I'm going to talk to Cassandra about one
last dip into the vaults to see if there's any

00:36:58.254 --> 00:37:03.644
potions. We know we have to leave them with
something in case everything goes wrong, but

00:37:03.644 --> 00:37:09.352
anything we can take with us will be helpful, and
then I have to fix this giant mess of parts that

00:37:09.352 --> 00:37:15.638
are currently in my bag. I may need to spend a
little money. I do apologize.

00:37:15.638 --> 00:37:17.232
LAURA: Darling.

00:37:17.232 --> 00:37:21.468
TALIESIN: Okay, just letting you know. It might be
a bit expensive to get everything working again.

00:37:21.468 --> 00:37:24.272
LIAM: Percy, spend it all.

00:37:24.272 --> 00:37:26.370
TALIESIN: I will not spend it all. I promise.

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:30.640
LAURA: I gave an entire bag of jewels to a random
efreet.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.162
TALIESIN: That was brazen, yes.

00:37:33.162 --> 00:37:39.536
MARISHA: We got armor out of it, though. It's not
like we didn't get something from it.

00:37:39.536 --> 00:37:45.415
TALIESIN: If anyone asks about the plan, the plan
is chaos, if everyone agrees with this. We want to

00:37:45.415 --> 00:37:52.643
break up their forces as much as possible. We want
them sending ten percent of their forces to every

00:37:52.643 --> 00:37:59.236
edge of the city. They know where we're going;
they know we're eventually heading to the center,

00:37:59.236 --> 00:38:05.968
and he's not going to leave anymore, but we're
going to make it very difficult for them. They're

00:38:05.968 --> 00:38:11.169
either going to be fighting us in every corner, or
they're going to be letting the entire city fall

00:38:11.169 --> 00:38:12.525
back to us.

00:38:12.525 --> 00:38:14.831
LAURA: I'm going to go find Zahra.

00:38:14.831 --> 00:38:17.602
SAM: Splitting the party five ways.

00:38:17.602 --> 00:38:18.992
MARISHA: I go find Kash.

00:38:18.992 --> 00:38:27.164
MATT: Okay. Vex, as you progress up to the
secondary floor to the outside of Zahra's room,

00:38:27.164 --> 00:38:29.820
the door is closed.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:33.982
LAURA: Zahra, dear?

00:38:33.982 --> 00:38:36.334
MATT: Zahra, you hear a knock at your door.

00:38:36.334 --> 00:38:38.123
MARY: Hello?

00:38:38.123 --> 00:38:41.077
(laughter)

00:38:41.077 --> 00:38:43.354
MARY: What is it, darling? I'm trying to sleep.

00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:46.265
LAURA: Oh!

00:38:46.265 --> 00:38:50.370
SAM: This is where the live studio audience is
supposed to applaud.

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:52.976
(laughter)

00:38:52.976 --> 00:38:58.107
MARISHA: You had one job, pit crew.

00:38:58.107 --> 00:38:59.891
TALIESIN: You had five jobs--

00:38:59.891 --> 00:39:03.393
MATT: You had 12 jobs, pit crew.

00:39:03.393 --> 00:39:05.147
MARY: Anything in my eyes?

00:39:05.147 --> 00:39:08.536
LAURA: Not much time to sleep, I'm afraid.

00:39:08.536 --> 00:39:11.816
MARY: Unfortunately, I've been buried in books.

00:39:11.816 --> 00:39:17.109
LAURA: Yes, and plans are moving ahead much
faster than we anticipated.

00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:23.459
MARY: First off, I heard word about a white
dragon. Sister killer!

00:39:23.459 --> 00:39:26.681
(laughter)

00:39:26.681 --> 00:39:33.778
MARY: Yes, we have to go get tattoos. Tell me,
what's the news? Catch me up.

00:39:33.778 --> 00:39:36.333
LAURA: We're marching on Emon tomorrow.

00:39:36.333 --> 00:39:40.136
MARY: Oh! I was going to get my hair done. All
right.

00:39:40.136 --> 00:39:42.833
LAURA: That's how it is. All the way.

00:39:42.833 --> 00:39:51.159
MARY: I haven't heard much. I've been reading,
I've been decorating, and I've been enchanting and

00:39:51.159 --> 00:39:54.538
making things. Tell me, what's the news with
Thordak?

00:39:54.538 --> 00:40:01.829
LAURA: Well, he's terrible. He's even worse than
we thought. Armies are marching on the city, and we plan

00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:10.160
on coming in from underneath, maybe striking at
him where he doesn't realize. And we'd like your

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.356
help, if you're willing.

00:40:12.356 --> 00:40:20.113
MARY: I don't think so. Oh, all right. Yes, I'd
love to. I would love to. I've been craving dragon

00:40:20.113 --> 00:40:23.361
meat since Rimefang, so yes.

00:40:23.361 --> 00:40:33.461
LAURA: I don't know if we'll succeed, and I'm sure
we won't all make it out alive. It's a big ask.

00:40:33.461 --> 00:40:40.430
MARY: (sighs) Isn't death supposed to be a
wonderful adventure, as well?

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:41.767
LAURA: I think so.

00:40:41.767 --> 00:40:45.476
MARY: Fuck it.

00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:46.901
LAURA: Fuck it.

00:40:46.901 --> 00:40:55.089
MARY: Fuck it. Durr 'n' durr. Fuck it. Let's
do it. Yeah, all right. I've been

00:40:55.089 --> 00:40:58.044
sitting for too long; I need some action.

00:40:58.044 --> 00:41:00.428
LAURA: Did you make any dragon arrows?

00:41:00.428 --> 00:41:03.389
MARISHA: Buy her a drink first.

00:41:03.389 --> 00:41:05.622
MARY: I'll get back to you on it.

00:41:05.622 --> 00:41:09.320
LAURA: I plan on it. So many drinks.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:15.526
MARY: What next? What do we do?

00:41:15.526 --> 00:41:22.431
LAURA: We prepare tonight, and we leave tomorrow,
I assume. You know us; we don't have a plan,

00:41:22.431 --> 00:41:26.421
really. I have no idea what's going on. Be
prepared.

00:41:26.421 --> 00:41:32.452
MARY: Isn't that the secret to adulthood, that we're
all winging it? Yes, all right. Good.

00:41:32.452 --> 00:41:35.085
LAURA: I'm glad you're joining.

00:41:35.085 --> 00:41:37.336
MARY: Darling, I'm with you wherever you go.

00:41:37.336 --> 00:41:48.930
MATT: With your recently joined into your crusade
tiefling ally, you go to gather the rest of your party.

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:53.424
Who's going to Kashaw?

00:41:53.424 --> 00:41:57.307
(laughter)

00:41:57.307 --> 00:41:59.415
TALIESIN: Kiki, what are you doing?

00:41:59.415 --> 00:42:09.466
MATT: You take a long, slow, careful walk down
through town to the guard barracks.

00:42:09.466 --> 00:42:14.053
MARISHA: I try not to step on any cracks in the
sidewalk on the way. It's very important.

00:42:14.053 --> 00:42:20.173
MATT: It's a warmer and more humid day than you're
used to in Whitestone. A couple of insects are out

00:42:20.173 --> 00:42:24.585
and about. There's a lot of aspects of Whitestone
that you're noticing for the first time, because

00:42:24.585 --> 00:42:32.031
you really want to focus on anything else, and yet
suddenly, without warning, you stop and realize

00:42:32.031 --> 00:42:38.815
you're standing right outside of the barracks. You
see that recently there had been a finished

00:42:38.815 --> 00:42:44.038
training session with the up-and-coming guard, and
there, sitting off to the side, partially

00:42:44.038 --> 00:42:47.816
armored and currently sharpening the edge of his
spear, is Kashaw.

00:42:47.816 --> 00:42:50.127
MARISHA: He's on the outside? Oh shit.

00:42:50.127 --> 00:42:51.940
MATT: And he's watching you.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:57.038
(laughter)

00:42:57.038 --> 00:42:59.490
MATT: Kashaw?

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:01.257
SAM: Ladies and gentlemen.

00:43:01.257 --> 00:43:06.756
(cheering and applause)

00:43:06.756 --> 00:43:19.094
MARISHA: I drop to one knee and start tying my
boot. I start retying my shoe.

00:43:19.094 --> 00:43:26.065
WILL: You're five feet from me. Am I not supposed
to see that?

00:43:26.065 --> 00:43:31.213
MARISHA: Oh my god! Kash! Whoa, I didn't see you
there.

00:43:31.213 --> 00:43:34.464
WILL: Really? Interesting. It was the looking at
me that threw me.

00:43:34.464 --> 00:43:40.546
MARISHA: Sorry, I've had something in my eye ever
since this scrying spell earlier. Shit's been

00:43:40.546 --> 00:43:45.319
blurry. Yeah, no. You're clearly in focus now.

00:43:45.319 --> 00:43:47.894
WILL: Okay.

00:43:47.894 --> 00:43:52.291
MARISHA: Hi. Hey, how's it going, man?

00:43:52.291 --> 00:43:55.367
WILL: Everything's been great. Life's been
awesome. What can I help you with?

00:43:55.367 --> 00:43:59.769
(laughter)

00:43:59.769 --> 00:44:06.667
MARISHA: Okay, Kash, I'm sensing a little bit of
underlying aggression.

00:44:06.667 --> 00:44:08.364
WILL: Really? It's underlying?

00:44:08.364 --> 00:44:11.835
(laughter)

00:44:11.835 --> 00:44:16.609
MARISHA: Okay, look. I know we fucked you. Look.

00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:22.710
WILL: Why don't you send me out to get some milk
and go save the world while I'm out there doing

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:26.094
that? What's up there, lady? What? What do you
want? Speak!

00:44:26.094 --> 00:44:40.154
MARISHA: (stammers) I'm trying to think of what to
say. Please help us! We're going to die, and we

00:44:40.154 --> 00:44:44.138
need you. I'm sorry!

00:44:44.138 --> 00:44:50.134
WILL: I've got nothing to that. Help you what,
first of all.

00:44:50.134 --> 00:44:54.109
MARISHA: Okay, you know how we've been hunting
down those dragons?

00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:56.198
WILL: I vaguely remember it, yes.

00:44:56.198 --> 00:45:03.317
MARISHA: We've been doing an okay job, because
we've killed a few, but now there's the big one

00:45:03.317 --> 00:45:09.040
that's left, Thordak, and then we might be working
with the one that killed all my people, if you

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:14.674
remember that there was one that killed them, so
now we're working with her, and we're gathering an

00:45:14.674 --> 00:45:25.231
entire army, and we need as many talented and
charming and gifted people that we can get, so I

00:45:25.231 --> 00:45:32.997
thought-- I'm really sorry we made you be an errand
boy. I didn't vote for that, by the way. I was

00:45:32.997 --> 00:45:34.859
trying to--

00:45:34.859 --> 00:45:38.659
WILL: Keep babbling. This is fun.

00:45:38.659 --> 00:45:44.614
LAURA: I'm sweating for her.

00:45:44.614 --> 00:45:47.836
(laughter)

00:45:47.836 --> 00:45:52.134
SAM: This is just how the Patrick Rothfuss
conversation went.

00:45:52.134 --> 00:45:56.010
MARY: This is how it's going to go with you and
Jarett.

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:59.152
WILL: Why should I help you? Give me one reason.

00:45:59.152 --> 00:46:03.892
MARISHA: Why did you bring back Vex?

00:46:03.892 --> 00:46:06.832
WILL: Because I thought Vax would kill me if I
didn't.

00:46:06.832 --> 00:46:09.741
MARISHA: Maybe Vax will kill you if you don't help
us.

00:46:09.741 --> 00:46:13.134
WILL: Now I'm not really that scared of him.

00:46:13.134 --> 00:46:20.583
MARISHA: That's not true. You did it because
you're a good person. You ultimately want to see

00:46:20.583 --> 00:46:26.321
change in the world. I know you do. And I know you
care, even though you pretend like you don't. So

00:46:26.321 --> 00:46:27.535
that's why.

00:46:27.535 --> 00:46:29.608
WILL: In all fairness, dragons bring change.

00:46:29.608 --> 00:46:42.481
MARISHA: Kash, that's not the type of change--
there are better ways to bring change than through

00:46:42.481 --> 00:46:45.659
death and destruction.

00:46:45.659 --> 00:46:48.100
WILL: Who else is helping you?

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.770
MARISHA: Everyone, and then Zahra.

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:53.686
WILL: Z? I'm in. Where is she?

00:46:53.686 --> 00:46:56.546
MARISHA: Wow.

00:46:56.546 --> 00:47:02.762
WILL: Let's go. Where is she?

00:47:02.762 --> 00:47:10.372
MARISHA: Should have led with that. All right,
let's go. This way. Glad I spilled my soul and

00:47:10.372 --> 00:47:15.138
everything, and I just splashed coffee in my face. Come
on, Kash. Come on!

00:47:15.138 --> 00:47:17.010
WILL: On my way. Let's go.

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:21.320
MATT: All right, as you gather your implements
of war and your supplies you may need for

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:25.589
this journey, you two head back to the castle, a
nice, solid six feet between you as you walk.

00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:30.162
WILL: I'm hitting the wall constantly over here.

00:47:30.162 --> 00:47:37.087
LAURA: I can't scooch any more!

00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:39.669
LIAM: You don't have any guests over there.

00:47:39.669 --> 00:47:41.907
MARY: We got it!

00:47:41.907 --> 00:47:43.357
WILL: You comfortable over there?

00:47:43.357 --> 00:47:44.862
MARY: You got enough room, Sam?

00:47:44.862 --> 00:47:47.399
TALIESIN: We're working on getting a bigger cup.

00:47:47.399 --> 00:47:50.061
MARY: There's no swiveling.

00:47:50.061 --> 00:47:55.408
SAM: I'm going to give a seat just to my cup,
because we have the space here to do it.

00:47:55.408 --> 00:47:58.303
LAURA: We're turning into one person.

00:47:58.303 --> 00:48:02.008
MARY: The twinsies will finally be conjoined.

00:48:02.008 --> 00:48:05.110
LAURA: Sorry.

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:17.401
MATT: Scanlan, you are off looking for Jarett. Go
ahead and make an investigation check.

00:48:17.401 --> 00:48:23.520
SAM: 18. 28.

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:31.963
MATT: 28. All right. You know exactly the type of
people that he talks to. Because he's been put in

00:48:31.963 --> 00:48:38.550
this position of power within the guard hierarchy
here in Whitestone, within the Pale Guard, there's

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:43.564
really only three people that he hangs with. One
of them's Kashaw. One of them's a guy who you

00:48:43.564 --> 00:48:47.635
never remember the name of, who's fun. That's the
guy you're going to go bother. You go and talk to

00:48:47.635 --> 00:48:53.959
him for a bit, and he points to one of the few
currently functioning, non-destroyed taverns in

00:48:53.959 --> 00:48:59.492
Whitestone. There you find him sitting there
drinking alone; not heavy drinking, in his cups,

00:48:59.492 --> 00:49:03.506
but staring off at the wall and sipping a midday
ale.

00:49:03.506 --> 00:49:06.852
SAM: Friend Jarett.

00:49:06.852 --> 00:49:14.069
MATT: "Ah. It is good to see you alive and-- right.
Hi."

00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:21.660
SAM: Just coming to check on my main man J-money.
It's J, right?

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:26.761
MATT: "It is, yes. Otherwise, it would be
Garett."

00:49:26.761 --> 00:49:28.434
SAM: You're right.

00:49:28.434 --> 00:49:38.325
MATT: "I'm good. I'm a little nervous, to be
honest. I like to shoot things from a wall. I

00:49:38.325 --> 00:49:43.519
"don't like to go through a wall to shoot things,
and that's been happening a lot recently, and from

00:49:43.519 --> 00:49:47.055
"what I've been hearing, tomorrow is looking to be
a very big day."

00:49:47.055 --> 00:49:52.773
SAM: Well, it's going to be quite a fight. Can we
count on you to come with us, perhaps?

00:49:52.773 --> 00:49:58.073
MATT: "I'd assume that would be the case. I would
not want to have all of you disappear into

00:49:58.073 --> 00:50:05.013
"darkness and fire without me yelling behind you,
'don't die!' I figure that's the very least I

00:50:05.013 --> 00:50:07.116
"could offer for this circumstance."

00:50:07.116 --> 00:50:14.539
SAM: We would be honored to have you with us, and
as you are still technically our employee,

00:50:14.539 --> 00:50:17.887
there'll be a bonus for you at the end of it.

00:50:17.887 --> 00:50:19.568
MATT: "Another bonus?"

00:50:19.568 --> 00:50:25.123
SAM: Oh. Yes. I wasn't aware there was a-- yes.
Two bonuses.

00:50:25.123 --> 00:50:26.698
MATT: "Oh yeah, there was like four bonuses."

00:50:26.698 --> 00:50:29.115
SAM: You deserve all of them.

00:50:29.115 --> 00:50:31.698
MATT: "Damn right."

00:50:31.698 --> 00:50:40.075
SAM: The other thing that we had talked about, did
that ever come to fruition?

00:50:40.075 --> 00:50:48.521
MATT: "No, it was unfortunate. You see, my sister
is engaged recently--" And he stands up and walks

00:50:48.521 --> 00:50:55.863
out of the tavern, putting a coin down on the
front of the bar. "No worries. I'll find you

00:50:55.863 --> 00:50:57.784
"another lady." And he walks outside.

00:50:57.784 --> 00:51:06.633
SAM: Oh. Oh, we're speaking in code. Okay. Yes, I
need a lady so bad, and you were going to find me

00:51:06.633 --> 00:51:08.160
a date.

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:18.281
MATT: "You're so much better at this when other
people are involved. Why are you so bad when it's me?"

00:51:18.281 --> 00:51:21.757
(laughter)

00:51:21.757 --> 00:51:27.079
MATT: He goes outside and guides you into a shaded
portion of a nearby alley and leans against the

00:51:27.079 --> 00:51:29.149
wall, waiting for you to follow in.

00:51:29.149 --> 00:51:34.736
SAM: So. Is she a brunette?

00:51:34.736 --> 00:51:37.454
MATT: "We're out of the tavern."

00:51:37.454 --> 00:51:43.612
SAM: Okay. I don't know how long to keep the cover
going.

00:51:43.612 --> 00:51:48.714
MATT: "It's fine. Look, it is very difficult to
find anything right now, the way things have been.

00:51:48.714 --> 00:51:50.903
"But I did manage to scavenge a little bit of
suude."

00:51:50.903 --> 00:51:52.003
SAM: Suude?

00:51:52.003 --> 00:51:57.581
MATT: "Yes." And he pulls out a small brown pouch,
maybe about the size of a d20, really. Like a

00:51:57.581 --> 00:52:05.465
little nugget there, and it's tied tightly, and he
pockets real fast. "Now, don't ask me again to do this."

00:52:05.465 --> 00:52:09.121
SAM: Wait, are you a cop? You have to tell me if
you're a cop. Are you a cop?

00:52:09.121 --> 00:52:10.650
MATT: "No."

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:12.146
SAM: Okay, good.

00:52:12.146 --> 00:52:16.582
TALIESIN: That's a myth, for the kids at home, by
the way. Just want to get that out there. Sorry.

00:52:16.582 --> 00:52:19.888
Can't fill their heads with bad ideas. Carry on.

00:52:19.888 --> 00:52:23.727
WILL: Kids arrested all over town tonight.

00:52:23.727 --> 00:52:27.356
TALIESIN: Are you a cop? No?

00:52:27.356 --> 00:52:36.445
SAM: All right. How much do I owe you for this?

00:52:36.445 --> 00:52:41.958
MATT: "No, don't worry about it. Simply the bonus.
Whatever you feel you owe me for it. But not

00:52:41.958 --> 00:52:45.496
"again, please. It's harrowing."

00:52:45.496 --> 00:52:47.330
LIAM: Heroin?

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:51.365
MATT: "Harrowing. It was harrowing to acquire this
for you."

00:52:51.365 --> 00:53:02.094
SAM: Jarett, thank you for this. Thank you very
much. And I'm cool and all, but do you put it up

00:53:02.094 --> 00:53:10.436
your butt, or snort it, or do you burn it somehow,
or wrap it in something, or eat it? I'm pretty

00:53:10.436 --> 00:53:11.775
cool, but--

00:53:11.775 --> 00:53:14.463
(laughter)

00:53:14.508 --> 00:53:15.928
OFF-SCREEN: Ha!

00:53:15.928 --> 00:53:20.411
(laughter)

00:53:20.411 --> 00:53:28.490
MATT: He leans in really close, one eye
half-squinted, going, "I will never understand

00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:34.215
"you, Scanlan Shorthalt. You're a smart boy. How do
you think you use it?"

00:53:34.215 --> 00:53:37.054
SAM: In a pipe of some sort?

00:53:37.054 --> 00:53:46.125
MATT: "Sure." And he walks out of the alleyway,
really embarrassed that he even did this. The

00:53:46.125 --> 00:53:52.983
minute you said that, he was like, oh no, I just
bought beer for a 12-year-old. He's like, ooh.

00:53:52.983 --> 00:53:57.782
TALIESIN: I'd like to think that "ha!" was passing
that guy coming out of the pub, and getting a

00:53:57.782 --> 00:53:58.975
second--

00:53:58.975 --> 00:54:11.465
SAM: All right, when you get her number, call me
or whatever, so we'll meet her later.

00:54:11.465 --> 00:54:20.197
MATT: He walks away and puts his hand up with a--
and keeps walking. You can almost see the hanging

00:54:20.197 --> 00:54:24.051
head shake as he continues back towards where he
was in the tavern.

00:54:24.051 --> 00:54:25.471
SAM: That went well.

00:54:25.471 --> 00:54:26.498
TALIESIN: That went very well.

00:54:26.498 --> 00:54:27.361
SAM: I got that.

00:54:27.361 --> 00:54:28.264
TALIESIN: You did that.

00:54:28.264 --> 00:54:29.273
SAM: I did it.

00:54:29.273 --> 00:54:32.276
MATT: (laughs) Mark down one small pocket satchel
of suude. S-U-U-D-E.

00:54:32.276 --> 00:54:34.729
LIAM: That's for after the dragon.

00:54:34.729 --> 00:54:38.238
LAURA: It's his own drugs. He's made his own drugs
up.

00:54:38.238 --> 00:54:39.901
TALIESIN: Here you go. Right there.

00:54:39.901 --> 00:54:41.186
MARY: He made drugs?

00:54:41.186 --> 00:54:43.640
LAURA: Well, Matt made drugs.

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:46.068
TALIESIN: Put a glove on if you're going to get
high if you hold it for too long.

00:54:46.068 --> 00:54:48.594
MATT: There is a society out there. People are
going to continue to find ways to smoke, swallow,

00:54:48.594 --> 00:54:50.460
or inhale substances.

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:51.832
WILL: Definitely not a cop.

00:54:51.832 --> 00:54:53.007
MATT: Definitely not.

00:54:53.007 --> 00:54:54.284
WILL: Definitely not a cop.

00:54:54.284 --> 00:54:56.008
MARY: Sometimes you ride the dragon before you
kill it.

00:54:56.008 --> 00:54:57.174
WILL: (laughs) Exactly.

00:54:57.174 --> 00:54:59.092
TALIESIN: Got to ride the dragon before you ride
the dragon.

00:54:59.092 --> 00:55:00.082
MARISHA: That's right.

00:55:00.082 --> 00:55:01.653
MARY: You've got to ride the dragon before you
kill it.

00:55:01.653 --> 00:55:02.685
WILL: That's right.

00:55:02.685 --> 00:55:04.057
MARY: It's going to be great to watch Scanlan take
drugs.

00:55:04.057 --> 00:55:05.189
(laughter)

00:55:05.189 --> 00:55:09.042
MATT: How do you think herbalists of previous
generations found out which plants are poisonous?

00:55:09.042 --> 00:55:10.508
Huh? That's bad.

00:55:10.508 --> 00:55:12.446
(laughter)

00:55:12.446 --> 00:55:18.654
MATT: It's culture, man. All right, Percy, we need
to make some checks for you.

00:55:18.654 --> 00:55:21.671
TALIESIN: Actually, do I have to check even if I'm
spending money?

00:55:21.671 --> 00:55:23.844
MATT: You're spending money to fix it, but--

00:55:23.844 --> 00:55:26.833
LAURA: How much money are you spending?

00:55:26.833 --> 00:55:28.505
TALIESIN: How much do we have? Sorry, I'll stop.

00:55:28.505 --> 00:55:29.865
LAURA: You tell me what you need.

00:55:29.865 --> 00:55:30.891
TALIESIN: We'll find out.

00:55:30.891 --> 00:55:33.811
MARISHA: You're the prince of Whitestone. Can't
you tap some taxes or something?

00:55:33.811 --> 00:55:35.188
MATT: You could, actually.

00:55:35.188 --> 00:55:40.214
TALIESIN: I really try not to do that. That's a
dick move. People are already iffy on these

00:55:40.214 --> 00:55:41.367
things, I imagine.

00:55:41.367 --> 00:55:43.502
LIAM: Spend everything right now.

00:55:43.502 --> 00:55:54.380
TALIESIN: Wow! That made five decisions and landed
on a really good one. That's 28.

00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:59.286
MATT: Okay, yeah. This is for Bad News?

00:55:59.286 --> 00:56:02.683
TALIESIN: Yeah, Bad News is the only one that is
broken. The rest survived.

00:56:02.683 --> 00:56:08.398
MATT: Yeah, that's fine. For Bad News, the
original cost I have here... sorry, have to pull

00:56:08.398 --> 00:56:10.917
up the PDF to remind me, so I get it right.

00:56:10.917 --> 00:56:13.653
LIAM: Two electrum.

00:56:13.653 --> 00:56:23.693
MATT: (laughs) I'd put it about at maybe 500 gold
worth of materials.

00:56:23.693 --> 00:56:26.412
TALIESIN: Oh! Okay. Feel better about that.

00:56:26.412 --> 00:56:29.628
MATT: It's not a magical implement, 
but it is expensive.

00:56:29.628 --> 00:56:38.055
TALIESIN: It is. It's got a lot of moving parts.
And then I'm going to go and talk to Cassandra,

00:56:38.055 --> 00:56:39.586
quickly.

00:56:39.586 --> 00:56:46.162
MATT: All right. As you make your way to try and
find Cassandra, she is actually currently in her

00:56:46.162 --> 00:56:54.535
room talking with Allura. Talking with Gilmore,
with Brom and Drake. There's guards rushing in and

00:56:54.535 --> 00:56:58.857
out. There's a general sense of ramping energy, as
everyone is gathering everything they have at

00:56:58.857 --> 00:57:01.616
their disposal in preparation for what's going to
happen tomorrow.

00:57:01.616 --> 00:57:03.289
MARY: Where's Raishan?

00:57:03.289 --> 00:57:06.765
MATT: (laughs) You can go look for Raishan, if you
like.

00:57:06.765 --> 00:57:08.156
MARY: No, I just wanted to know.

00:57:08.156 --> 00:57:14.714
MATT: You don't know where Raishan is right now.
As you enter the room, over in the corner,

00:57:14.714 --> 00:57:18.388
mid-conversation, Cassandra is currently rolling
up some papers and handing them to a guard. Turns

00:57:18.388 --> 00:57:21.800
and finishes a quick bit of conversation
whispering off to the side with Drake. Turns

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.155
around and her eyes meet you and she goes,
"Brother."

00:57:24.155 --> 00:57:25.362
TALIESIN: My lady.

00:57:25.362 --> 00:57:28.519
MATT: "Yes. What can I do to help you?"

00:57:28.519 --> 00:57:32.731
TALIESIN: We're preparing to leave. We are
preparing to have a small strike force go

00:57:32.731 --> 00:57:38.667
underneath the city and do what we can while the other
armies hopefully distract, thin the forces and

00:57:38.667 --> 00:57:42.405
give us a shot at taking care of this once and
for all.

00:57:42.405 --> 00:57:43.882
MATT: "Right."

00:57:43.882 --> 00:57:49.485
TALIESIN: Is there anything left in the vaults,
potion-wise? Especially healing potions. We don't

00:57:49.485 --> 00:57:52.272
want to drain you, obviously, but I thought I
would make one last push.

00:57:52.272 --> 00:58:06.610
MATT: "We've provided what we can. Drake, and a few
of our helpful supporters here in the city have

00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:12.221
"been providing for this purpose. It's not much,
but we do have--" and she snaps her fingers and

00:58:12.221 --> 00:58:14.884
points to Drake.

00:58:14.884 --> 00:58:19.973
You see he's currently putting together a big
leather package. "Oh! No worry." And he lifts it up on

00:58:19.973 --> 00:58:25.058
the table. You hear the clanking of glass around
on the inside of the satchel. He pulls it down a

00:58:25.058 --> 00:58:30.001
little bit over the front, pushes to the side and
you can see there are two cushioned racks that

00:58:30.001 --> 00:58:39.681
contain various sizes of vials. "All right, we've
got three greater healing potions, one basic

00:58:39.681 --> 00:58:44.932
"healing potion. That's as much as we can find, to
be honest right now. There hasn't been a lot of

00:58:44.932 --> 00:58:50.044
"trade, and our supply's been limited, and most of
what we had has been used by you or folks here in

00:58:50.044 --> 00:58:51.487
"defense of the city."

00:58:51.487 --> 00:58:52.597
LAURA: You said one basic?

00:58:52.597 --> 00:58:58.034
MATT: "One basic. Yeah, regular healing potion.
However, I've spent my time, knowing what's

00:58:58.034 --> 00:59:04.278
"coming, and being a focuser of the elemental arts,
brewing a few helpful bits here. I wish I had more

00:59:04.278 --> 00:59:08.371
"time, but our timeline has been a bit
accelerated."

00:59:08.371 --> 00:59:16.341
He pulls out the second cushioned grouping
here. The vials are different shapes. It seems

00:59:16.341 --> 00:59:21.135
like the glass has been scavenged from what was
available, but the coloration is similar, and you

00:59:21.135 --> 00:59:25.584
recognize these. You've had these before. These
are four potions of fire resistance.

00:59:25.584 --> 00:59:28.234
SAM: That's huge.

00:59:28.234 --> 00:59:29.375
LAURA: That's great.

00:59:29.375 --> 00:59:30.409
MARISHA: That's massive.

00:59:30.409 --> 00:59:35.912
TALIESIN: We will be grateful for you till the end
of our days.

00:59:35.912 --> 00:59:37.797
MATT: "Oh, I count on it."

00:59:37.797 --> 00:59:41.041
TALIESIN: It may only be a day, but you will have
it.

00:59:41.041 --> 00:59:42.151
(laughter)

00:59:42.151 --> 00:59:47.517
MATT: "Just remembered for these in particular,
they don't last a terribly long time. One hour.

00:59:47.517 --> 00:59:50.117
"Make sure you don't drink it too soon."

00:59:50.117 --> 00:59:54.800
TALIESIN: One hour will be all that is necessary.

00:59:54.800 --> 01:00:03.504
MATT: "I certainly hope so. So. That's what I am
able to provide for this. I'll be there helping

01:00:03.504 --> 01:00:07.273
"with some of the distraction, so we'll figure out
some of the details for the specific attack, but

01:00:07.273 --> 01:00:12.552
"we're pulling all that we can for this, and we'll
figure out who's going where, who's attacking when

01:00:12.552 --> 01:00:18.492
"and in what way, I guess, if not tonight,
tomorrow." And he looks over to Cassandra and

01:00:18.492 --> 01:00:26.477
nods. "I'm going to go pray." He leaves the room.

01:00:26.477 --> 01:00:29.398
LAURA: Can I ask a question?

01:00:29.398 --> 01:00:30.387
MATT: Yes.

01:00:30.387 --> 01:00:34.759
LAURA: With potions, do they stack? Can you take
multiple ones and get multiple benefits, or is it

01:00:34.759 --> 01:00:37.374
like you take one potion and that's the one potion
you get to take?

01:00:37.374 --> 01:00:43.567
MATT: I mean, if they're different types of
potions, I'd say they could stack, to a certain

01:00:43.567 --> 01:00:47.576
degree. If you just begin to chug four potions
in a row I might be asking for some constitution

01:00:47.576 --> 01:00:49.283
saving throws.

01:00:49.283 --> 01:00:52.223
TALIESIN: Or like a mixed drink, that can get
weird, right?

01:00:52.223 --> 01:00:53.787
MATT: Yeah. Things might not--

01:00:53.787 --> 01:00:56.248
MARY: Long island ice tea of death.

01:00:56.248 --> 01:01:00.151
MATT: Yeah, exactly. Some effects might not mingle
well or the urge from your body might reject that

01:01:00.151 --> 01:01:03.486
much ingestion of enchanted fluid.

01:01:03.486 --> 01:01:05.240
LAURA: Okay. Cool. Just checking.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:09.282
MARISHA: Don't mix your darks with your clears--
Pick one.

01:01:09.282 --> 01:01:12.387
MATT: Don't eat the giant toenail at the bottom
of the bottle.

01:01:12.387 --> 01:01:18.491
TALIESIN: Water breathing before fire, never been
higher.

01:01:18.491 --> 01:01:21.682
(laughter)

01:01:21.682 --> 01:01:24.345
TALIESIN: Exactly. I think that was the-- Yeah.

01:01:24.345 --> 01:01:26.015
SAM: True.

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:27.257
MATT: Anything else?

01:01:27.257 --> 01:01:30.461
TALIESIN: I'd like to just grab Cassandra really
quickly and take her aside.

01:01:30.461 --> 01:01:32.744
MATT: Okay. "Yes, brother?"

01:01:32.744 --> 01:01:40.783
TALIESIN: I will only take one moment of your
time. I've not had a moment to repay you for my

01:01:40.783 --> 01:01:55.097
part in all of this yet, and if we survive, I owe
you much. And if I don't, seal off the city. There

01:01:55.097 --> 01:02:03.674
is room underneath. Prepare for siege. Prepare to
be a safe haven. Do not be-- do what you can to

01:02:03.674 --> 01:02:08.271
save the city. Do not get involved in the
aftermath of this if we fail.

01:02:08.271 --> 01:02:14.079
MATT: "That's actually what I'm discussing with
Allura, and the reason she's staying back is to

01:02:14.079 --> 01:02:21.985
"help us continue should such an occasion arise.
But I am confident, knowing what you're capable

01:02:21.985 --> 01:02:30.788
"of, that we worry for naught. We're doing our best
here, and I know you are doing your best there.

01:02:30.788 --> 01:02:34.625
"Just come back to me."

01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:41.267
TALIESIN: I will do my best. We've-- for
centuries, you must know we have survived as

01:02:41.267 --> 01:02:50.561
realists. And it is very hot down there and I do
not like it. Good luck, see you soon.

01:02:50.561 --> 01:02:54.293
MATT: "I need you. Return."

01:02:54.293 --> 01:02:57.331
TALIESIN: I shall. And I go pack.

01:02:57.331 --> 01:03:06.589
MATT: Okay. As you leave, Vax crosses you in the
doorway, as Gilmore is in mid-conversation. Right

01:03:06.589 --> 01:03:11.007
now with-- well, it was with Drake and then when
he'd had the conversation, he watched and Drake

01:03:11.007 --> 01:03:14.654
left and so he was on his way out following
Percival. And you caught him.

01:03:14.654 --> 01:03:16.776
LIAM: Can I steal you for a second?

01:03:16.776 --> 01:03:18.101
MATT: "Certainly."

01:03:18.101 --> 01:03:19.561
LIAM: Over here.

01:03:19.561 --> 01:03:21.260
MATT: "All right."

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:22.590
LIAM: Hi, again.

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:23.766
MATT: "Hi."

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:27.135
LIAM: Remember how we just saw each other a couple
of days ago, and I tried to say goodbye, and you

01:03:27.135 --> 01:03:33.382
told me to promise you that I would see you
again?

01:03:33.382 --> 01:03:39.116
MATT: "Yes. And much to my delight, you've kept
your promise. And you better keep keeping it."

01:03:39.116 --> 01:03:50.891
LIAM: You know what would help with that? Boy,
have I got an offer for you. You want to help us

01:03:50.891 --> 01:04:06.635
save the world? My family and I, we're going to
him. And I wasn't sure the path that would take us

01:04:06.635 --> 01:04:15.839
there. I thought we might be on our own. But we're
back here. And you are easily the most impressive

01:04:15.839 --> 01:04:25.337
arcane user I've ever met in my life. And I want
us all to still be breathing in a week. I can't

01:04:25.337 --> 01:04:30.537
think of anyone better to stand with us than you,
Shaun.

01:04:30.537 --> 01:04:35.539
MATT: His eyes look off for a minute. And he
reaches up and rubs the back of his neck, and you

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:46.001
can see there's still a scar there. He goes, "If
I'm to be honest, I've felt a bit useless here in

01:04:46.001 --> 01:04:57.737
"Whitestone for quite some time. I was there when
this all began. It destroyed not just the thing

01:04:57.737 --> 01:05:11.831
"I've been working to build for so long of my life,
but friends, home, for all of us. So it is my just

01:05:11.831 --> 01:05:20.949
"honor, and vengeful glee, to join you on the siege
to Emon, if you will have me?"

01:05:20.949 --> 01:05:28.577
LIAM: I grasp him by the back of the head.
Gesundheit. I'm so glad to have you with us,

01:05:28.577 --> 01:05:31.569
friend. So glad.

01:05:31.569 --> 01:05:35.523
MATT: "Just stay alive. Keep that promise."

01:05:35.523 --> 01:05:37.848
LIAM: It will be a little bit easier now.

01:05:37.848 --> 01:05:40.388
MATT: "Good." And he smacks you on the cheek.

01:05:40.388 --> 01:05:42.842
LIAM: Good time for a musical quote.

01:05:42.842 --> 01:05:47.797
ALL: (singing) Stay alive.

01:05:47.797 --> 01:05:54.282
MATT: He smacks you on the cheek and goes,
"Learned that from you. All right then, I guess

01:05:54.282 --> 01:06:04.176
"I've got to gather my supplies and-- Oh, it's been
a while since I've seen some-- I've never

01:06:04.176 --> 01:06:08.344
"actually seen combat on this scale before when,
you know, I wasn't just trying to run away? So

01:06:08.344 --> 01:06:11.848
"let's see if I can knock off the old dust."

01:06:11.848 --> 01:06:13.602
LIAM: I'm sure it will be glorious.

01:06:13.602 --> 01:06:16.644
MATT: "Oh, I can guarantee it."

01:06:16.644 --> 01:06:19.574
MARISHA: Plug.

01:06:19.574 --> 01:06:21.759
MATT: "All right."

01:06:21.759 --> 01:06:23.591
LIAM: Let's do it.

01:06:23.591 --> 01:06:27.309
LAURA: I'm wondering if we should eat a Heroes'
Feast tonight, and then just eat one again

01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:31.960
tomorrow? 'Cause we just don't know what's going
to happen during the day anymore. Just a Heroes'

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:35.088
Feast every night. Be ready, and just, you know.

01:06:35.088 --> 01:06:38.162
SAM: Yep. Do we have the money for that?

01:06:38.162 --> 01:06:40.573
LAURA: It's, yeah. We're fine.

01:06:40.573 --> 01:06:43.350
SAM: All right.

01:06:43.350 --> 01:06:46.058
TALIESIN: I was looking forward to a Heroes'
Brunch, personally.

01:06:46.058 --> 01:06:48.038
LAURA: Either one.

01:06:48.038 --> 01:06:50.007
SAM: Bagels and lox?

01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:51.847
MATT: Heroes' High Tea.

01:06:51.847 --> 01:06:54.010
MARY: Eggs Benedict with lots of extra
hollandaise.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:57.637
TALIESIN: Capers of might.

01:06:57.637 --> 01:07:01.805
MATT: What else do you guys wish to prepare, if
anything?

01:07:01.805 --> 01:07:03.363
LIAM: Holy shit, man!

01:07:03.363 --> 01:07:05.913
LAURA: We have our potions. Should we split them
up?

01:07:05.913 --> 01:07:09.961
SAM: Who needs fire giant, I mean fire resistance,
the most?

01:07:09.961 --> 01:07:13.894
LAURA: Okay. We have five potions of fire
resistance.

01:07:13.894 --> 01:07:14.756
SAM: We do?

01:07:14.756 --> 01:07:18.804
LAURA: Yes, because we already had one. Now, we
have two superior, five regular healing, and three

01:07:18.804 --> 01:07:25.749
greater. What we also have is a potion of
invulnerability, which is clutch, and a potion of

01:07:25.749 --> 01:07:33.529
speed. We need to decide who to give the potion of
invulnerability to, because it lasts for ten

01:07:33.529 --> 01:07:34.401
minutes?

01:07:34.401 --> 01:07:39.308
MATT: No, one minute. I'm pretty sure, I'll check,
but that's a powerful-ass potion.

01:07:39.308 --> 01:07:41.348
LAURA: You can't die, right, when you take it?

01:07:41.348 --> 01:07:42.803
MATT: You wish!

01:07:42.803 --> 01:07:46.156
LAURA: I mean, can you take damage when you've got
it going? It's like a minute of no damage?

01:07:46.156 --> 01:07:53.210
MATT: You take damage, you have resistance to all
damage, so all damage you take is halved.

01:07:53.210 --> 01:07:55.690
MARY: Should that be decided mid-battle? Clutch.

01:07:55.690 --> 01:07:58.292
SAM: That one seems like a specific task.

01:07:58.292 --> 01:08:02.014
LAURA: That's a specific task kind of thing. So
we'll decide that later?

01:08:02.014 --> 01:08:08.291
TALIESIN: There is an item. And I'm currently
holding it, and I don't know if I'm the best

01:08:08.291 --> 01:08:14.208
person to be holding this. But I'm just going to
pass this down the line to see if anyone has an

01:08:14.208 --> 01:08:15.703
opinion.

01:08:15.703 --> 01:08:17.402
MARISHA: It's the sword.

01:08:17.402 --> 01:08:19.772
LIAM: This is too bad, I can't wield this fucker.

01:08:19.772 --> 01:08:21.531
LAURA: I can't wield a sword either.

01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:23.973
TALIESIN: It's a dex-based sword, correct?

01:08:23.973 --> 01:08:26.142
MATT: The Sword of Dragon-Slaying?

01:08:26.142 --> 01:08:28.074
TALIESIN: Yeah. Or it can switch.

01:08:28.074 --> 01:08:30.513
MATT: I'm allowing it to switch if need be.

01:08:30.513 --> 01:08:39.164
TALIESIN: So it can be strength- or dex-based.
Maybe this is the thing to hand to Grog. And one

01:08:39.164 --> 01:08:45.929
minute of invulnerability with that is possibly
the cruellest thing that dragon will have ever

01:08:45.929 --> 01:08:47.716
experienced.

01:08:47.716 --> 01:08:52.770
LAURA: The thing is, if he's raging, I don't know
if he'll think to switch over.

01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:55.109
TALIESIN: Well, it's an attuned weapon.

01:08:55.109 --> 01:08:57.350
MATT: He isn't resistant to fire while he's
raging.

01:08:57.350 --> 01:09:02.602
MARISHA: No, but he has resistance to physical
damage, and if he takes a potion of fire

01:09:02.602 --> 01:09:09.202
resistance, is he pretty much covered the same way
if he's raging and has a fire potion?

01:09:09.202 --> 01:09:10.812
MATT: Possibly.

01:09:10.812 --> 01:09:15.364
LIAM: I could use this because it's dex-based, if
I so choose?

01:09:15.364 --> 01:09:18.396
LAURA: But you can't do three attacks with it,
because it's bigger?

01:09:18.396 --> 01:09:21.908
MATT: Well, yeah. You would have one attack with
that.

01:09:21.908 --> 01:09:24.951
LIAM: One attack, but not-- I can't do longsword
and then a dagger?

01:09:24.951 --> 01:09:26.547
MATT: You could do longsword and then a bonus.

01:09:26.547 --> 01:09:28.306
LAURA: That's pretty cool.

01:09:28.306 --> 01:09:30.434
MATT: Let me check, I don't know if he can do them
all.

01:09:30.434 --> 01:09:36.360
LAURA: Could he do Whisper and then attack with
the dragon sword?

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:40.789
TALIESIN: I don't know how many items you have
attuned at the moment?

01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:42.640
WILL: Just two, I believe.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.256
TALIESIN: So you could go for a triple?

01:09:44.256 --> 01:09:56.437
WILL: I could. Well, I have my shadow spear. But
my nec, so you'd want the nec damage from that, is

01:09:56.437 --> 01:09:59.579
what you'd be looking for. I don't know if I could
wield the two of them together?

01:09:59.579 --> 01:10:02.731
TALIESIN: It's a one-handed sword, so I'm not
sure. What is your--

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:06.861
MATT: It has to be a light melee weapon in both
hands, it looks to do this, unless you have a feat

01:10:06.861 --> 01:10:08.295
to fix that.

01:10:08.295 --> 01:10:09.777
TALIESIN: Which I do.

01:10:09.777 --> 01:10:13.641
MATT: You have the-- Do you have Dual Wielder as a
feat?

01:10:13.641 --> 01:10:14.629
LIAM: Yes.

01:10:14.629 --> 01:10:17.415
MATT: Yeah, so yes, you can use the longsword and
Whisper in the other hand.

01:10:17.415 --> 01:10:18.823
LIAM: But it's attunement, so I have to choose
something.

01:10:18.823 --> 01:10:20.209
MATT: You'd have to chose that over--

01:10:20.209 --> 01:10:22.782
LIAM: This would supersede Whisper. Yeah.

01:10:22.782 --> 01:10:26.012
LAURA: What? Whisper is a Vestige.

01:10:26.012 --> 01:10:34.137
LIAM: I understand that, but this is very strong,
and with wings I could go anywhere.

01:10:34.137 --> 01:10:44.248
MATT: Do note. As part of the rogue ability-- I'm
just double-checking here, but I'm pretty sure--

01:10:44.248 --> 01:10:54.415
The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
Technically I'm allowing-- Actually, no, I'm

01:10:54.415 --> 01:10:56.787
allowing it to be a finesse.

01:10:56.787 --> 01:10:58.342
LIAM: You're allowing it? You're allowing it?

01:10:58.342 --> 01:11:03.193
MATT: Well, because it's strength or dex. I'm
sticking to my choice.

01:11:03.193 --> 01:11:04.653
LIAM: Okay. So it's light.

01:11:04.653 --> 01:11:07.947
MATT: It's not light. It's finesse. Meaning you
can choose strength or dexterity.

01:11:07.947 --> 01:11:12.581
MARY: I have a question. Last time I saw you, you
were looking for the Vestiges.

01:11:12.581 --> 01:11:13.687
LAURA: Yes.

01:11:13.687 --> 01:11:14.832
MARY: Did you find them?

01:11:14.832 --> 01:11:18.325
LAURA: All of them! &lt;i&gt;All&lt;/i&gt; of them! Well, all of
them that we know about.

01:11:18.325 --> 01:11:20.803
MARY: Do you know what to do with them?

01:11:20.803 --> 01:11:25.923
SAM: They are all super powerful, and are awesome,
and you'll see them in battle tomorrow.

01:11:25.923 --> 01:11:29.136
LAURA: That's all we know, is that you fight with
them. That's all we know. Why, do you know more?

01:11:29.136 --> 01:11:38.204
MARY: Is there any information we can glean from
Osysa at all, in Vasselheim, of how to use them?

01:11:38.204 --> 01:11:41.236
LAURA: Well, it would mean traveling to
Vasselheim.

01:11:41.236 --> 01:11:46.596
MARY: That's true. Is there any way to get there,
just quick and bamf in and just--

01:11:46.596 --> 01:11:48.805
TALIESIN: Last time we went somewhere quick and
bamfed in--

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:50.199
MARY: It was a long time?

01:11:50.199 --> 01:11:54.151
TALIESIN: Things went poorly. But we could speak
to her. We could talk to her.

01:11:54.151 --> 01:12:01.681
LAURA: One of us could go and bamf back. And
be back tomorrow morning.

01:12:01.681 --> 01:12:03.779
WILL: Well, you said you used them.

01:12:03.779 --> 01:12:05.460
MARISHA: Yeah, we've been using them

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:07.866
WILL: So then you know what they do, for the most
part, right?

01:12:07.866 --> 01:12:09.057
ALL: Yeah.

01:12:09.057 --> 01:12:10.304
WILL: Why waste a trip?

01:12:10.304 --> 01:12:13.289
MARY: What if there's a way to combine them?

01:12:13.289 --> 01:12:16.104
MARISHA: We tried. We put them all in a pile...

01:12:16.104 --> 01:12:18.060
(laughter)

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:19.873
WILL: That didn't work? Piling them on top of each
other didn't work?

01:12:19.873 --> 01:12:21.164
SAM: They didn't become a robot.

01:12:21.164 --> 01:12:23.005
LAURA: Not as much as we hoped it would, no.

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:26.721
MARISHA: Yeah. There are other Vestiges, too, that
are out there.

01:12:26.721 --> 01:12:28.705
LIAM: You have a potion of haste, yeah?

01:12:28.705 --> 01:12:30.035
LAURA: Yeah, potion of speed.

01:12:30.035 --> 01:12:33.077
LIAM: What if you gave me that and I gave you my
boots?

01:12:33.077 --> 01:12:35.021
SAM: Real quick, who needs the fire protection?

01:12:35.021 --> 01:12:36.734
MARY: I don't; I'm resistant.

01:12:36.734 --> 01:12:40.656
MARISHA: If we have plenty of potions, I'll take
it so I don't have to use a concentration spell.

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:46.591
TALIESIN: Ditto. My plan is to stay away from the
fire, but if I can't, that would certainly help.

01:12:46.591 --> 01:12:49.281
WILL: My plate is partially fire resistant.

01:12:49.281 --> 01:12:52.926
SAM: Vex? You don't need it.

01:12:52.926 --> 01:12:54.188
LAURA: Fire resistance?

01:12:54.188 --> 01:12:56.591
SAM: Didn't I give you that? Oh, I gave you cold
resistance.

01:12:56.591 --> 01:12:58.266
LAURA: Yeah. I need fire resistance.

01:12:58.266 --> 01:12:59.839
SAM: What did you give me?

01:12:59.839 --> 01:13:01.371
MARY: Chlamydia.

01:13:01.371 --> 01:13:03.131
SAM: Acid resistance.

01:13:03.131 --> 01:13:04.835
LAURA: Oh, yeah, that's right.

01:13:04.835 --> 01:13:12.108
MARY: Sorry. I was just in Australia. I got it
from a koala. I'm kidding.

01:13:12.108 --> 01:13:17.722
LAURA: I could take off my bracers--

01:13:17.722 --> 01:13:20.006
LIAM: It's up to you. I don't want to--

01:13:20.006 --> 01:13:21.885
MARISHA: There's also the discussion--

01:13:21.885 --> 01:13:24.468
SAM: What. More discussions?

01:13:24.468 --> 01:13:30.135
LIAM: You take the boots, I'm on the potion. I
have Whisper and this sword.

01:13:30.135 --> 01:13:35.296
MARISHA: Are we going to try and lure Thordak out
of his lair as a challenger?

01:13:35.296 --> 01:13:37.237
SAM: No, we're going to sneak into his lair,
right?

01:13:37.237 --> 01:13:39.206
WILL: You're going to corner it.

01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:42.562
TALIESIN: He's not going to leave his lair
anymore; he knows we're coming

01:13:42.562 --> 01:13:45.677
MARY: So, just very briefly, what is the plan?

01:13:45.677 --> 01:13:53.298
SAM: The plan, as I understated it, is: we send a
vicious army to attack at the gates, all over the

01:13:53.298 --> 01:13:59.971
place, drawing out Thordak's forces in an epic
battle. Blood, sinew, and gore everywhere, while

01:13:59.971 --> 01:14:07.158
we slip under the city, unbeknownst to Thordak, in
the tunnels with the Clasp leading us. Leading us

01:14:07.158 --> 01:14:11.891
right to the center of town where we pop up, and
surprise Thordak! He didn't know we were coming!

01:14:11.891 --> 01:14:15.756
He thought that there was an army at the gates!
And we stab him real quick and leave.

01:14:15.756 --> 01:14:19.719
LAURA: Done. And we also find whatever it is he's
protecting and kill that too.

01:14:19.719 --> 01:14:22.207
SAM: And at some point Raishan comes and helps
us.

01:14:22.207 --> 01:14:25.396
LAURA: Hey! What's up?

01:14:25.396 --> 01:14:26.612
WILL: How you doing?

01:14:26.612 --> 01:14:28.170
LAURA: I'm really sorry. About all of that.

01:14:28.170 --> 01:14:29.867
WILL: No, it's no problem. It's great.

01:14:29.867 --> 01:14:34.208
MARY: I have a question. Do I know about the
machine? Have I been told about that? Did Raishan

01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:35.592
tell me about that?

01:14:35.592 --> 01:14:36.766
MATT: Which one?

01:14:36.766 --> 01:14:39.067
MARY: The machine that Thordak is building, or
whatever the heck he's--

01:14:39.067 --> 01:14:45.662
MATT: Thordak, as far as you know, has let nobody
down there, Raishan included. And you have no idea

01:14:45.662 --> 01:14:47.858
what machinations Thordak is--

01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:49.314
MARY: But I do know about it.

01:14:49.314 --> 01:14:53.474
MATT: I mean, you know as much as they do. It's
come up in conversation previously, yes.

01:14:53.474 --> 01:14:57.269
WILL: And you said we're going into the tunnels?
Does anyone know the way through the tunnels?

01:14:57.269 --> 01:15:03.557
SAM: The Clasp does. They're an order of rogues
and thieves who hate us. But they're going to help us.

01:15:03.557 --> 01:15:05.136
MARY: Do you trust them?

01:15:05.136 --> 01:15:09.866
SAM: We totally trust them because they are
scoundrels and liars. And we have no other choice.

01:15:09.866 --> 01:15:11.972
TALIESIN: It doesn't serve them to lie to us.

01:15:11.972 --> 01:15:13.579
MARY: This sounds like a wonderful plan!

01:15:13.579 --> 01:15:16.768
WILL: It doesn't serve the scoundrels and liars to
lie and be scoundrels?

01:15:16.768 --> 01:15:20.289
TALIESIN: It doesn't serve them in this moment,
no. You know, if you're always a liar and a

01:15:20.289 --> 01:15:23.329
scoundrel, then no one will ever trust you to do
anything, they're only conveniently liars and

01:15:23.329 --> 01:15:24.746
scoundrels.

01:15:24.746 --> 01:15:27.121
WILL: I love this plan, this is great.

01:15:27.121 --> 01:15:28.990
SAM: (laughs) It's pretty air-tight.

01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:35.530
WILL: Yeah. I don't see any room for problems. So
you want to go in and corner the dragon where he

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:37.675
lives and is most powerful--

01:15:37.675 --> 01:15:38.960
SAM: Yes, yes!

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.710
WILL: His back to the wall, and no escape--

01:15:40.710 --> 01:15:42.925
SAM: He can escape at any moment, he can fly.

01:15:42.925 --> 01:15:46.095
WILL: Just us, though? Not the entire army which
we are using as a diversion?

01:15:46.095 --> 01:15:47.562
SAM: Just a partial group. Yes!

01:15:47.562 --> 01:15:49.594
WILL: But the scoundrels are going to lead us to
him?

01:15:49.594 --> 01:15:51.302
TALIESIN: Well, he has his own army.

01:15:51.302 --> 01:15:52.631
WILL: Of course.

01:15:52.631 --> 01:15:57.986
TALIESIN: So we need to keep his army distracted
so we're not fighting a dragon and an army. So

01:15:57.986 --> 01:16:03.413
those armies will hopefully either distract the
armies or; if he chooses not to send the armies to

01:16:03.413 --> 01:16:07.683
fight the rest of the armies that we've brought,
all of our armies also converge on the dragon's

01:16:07.683 --> 01:16:09.261
nest and then we have everybody there.

01:16:09.261 --> 01:16:13.465
WILL: You're engaging all of your forces in one
play? If he holds his forces back, why not send in

01:16:13.465 --> 01:16:15.362
skirmishes to see what happens first?

01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:17.785
LAURA: Oh, I like this plan. He's good.

01:16:17.785 --> 01:16:21.226
TALIESIN: No, we have people that we can do for
that. Although, it's not just one army we have. We

01:16:21.226 --> 01:16:22.830
have groups of them, technically. I was just--

01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:26.217
WILL: Attacking in one place?

01:16:26.217 --> 01:16:28.100
TALIESIN: Oh, no. All around the city.

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:29.942
WILL: Is there a weak point?

01:16:29.942 --> 01:16:31.925
SAM: Our plan.

01:16:31.925 --> 01:16:39.338
(laughter)

01:16:39.338 --> 01:16:49.406
TALIESIN: Don't you laugh! No! No! You don't get
to laugh. That scares us. Sadly, the only weak

01:16:49.406 --> 01:16:50.470
point is--

01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:57.009
LIAM: We either go with the shitty hand we've been
given, or we lie down and let him steamroll over us.

01:16:57.009 --> 01:17:01.593
MARISHA: Yes, but we can also try and formulate at
least a vague plan, so that we all don't die

01:17:01.593 --> 01:17:02.929
within a single--

01:17:02.932 --> 01:17:05.022
TALIESIN: I think this is a vague plan so that we
don't all die.

01:17:05.022 --> 01:17:07.607
MARISHA: All right, okay. Let's build off of what
Kash has.

01:17:07.607 --> 01:17:09.889
TALIESIN: If it's too specific, then it's going to
go wrong too quickly--

01:17:09.889 --> 01:17:11.652
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on. He's right.

01:17:11.652 --> 01:17:13.694
MARY: Plus we don't know what to expect. We have
to be ready for anything.

01:17:13.694 --> 01:17:17.537
WILL: We feint the city. Send skirmishes in to
feint the city so they don't know where the main

01:17:17.537 --> 01:17:22.568
attack is coming from. They'll have to defend
every wall. What you then do-- what you want them

01:17:22.568 --> 01:17:25.735
doing, because they're defending the wall, they
won't know when the serious attack is coming from.

01:17:25.735 --> 01:17:29.884
Then you send them towards one fortified position.
That would draw everybody to the one fortified

01:17:29.884 --> 01:17:34.318
position, but that's also a feint. And you come in
the backdoor. That's always the way you do it.

01:17:34.318 --> 01:17:39.518
Meanwhile, we'll take the scoundrels and liars.
And hopefully they're going to take us to corner

01:17:39.518 --> 01:17:43.128
the giant thing that wants to kill all of us, in
the place where he is the most powerful.

01:17:43.128 --> 01:17:44.508
LAURA: Yeah, that one!

01:17:44.508 --> 01:17:46.124
TALIESIN: I'm actually very okay with this plan.

01:17:46.124 --> 01:17:48.458
SAM: We should have him with us always!

01:17:48.458 --> 01:17:50.999
(laughter)

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:52.319
MARY: I totally agree.

01:17:52.319 --> 01:17:54.198
LAURA: Do it! Let's do that, let's do that!

01:17:54.198 --> 01:17:58.033
WILL: Let's do that! Okay! Great plan! Oh my god!
Who's in charge? Who's leading your ground forces?

01:17:58.033 --> 01:18:05.016
SAM: We have no leader. Except we do have a secret
weapon: we have a dragon who definitely wants

01:18:05.016 --> 01:18:08.739
something that we don't know about. Who might or
might not be working with us.

01:18:08.739 --> 01:18:11.022
LAURA: We also have another secret weapon!

01:18:11.022 --> 01:18:12.468
MARISHA: We have two dragons.

01:18:12.468 --> 01:18:14.283
SAM: We have a sword that is a dragon-slaying
sword.

01:18:14.283 --> 01:18:17.069
LIAM and MARISHA: A whole other dragon.

01:18:17.069 --> 01:18:23.412
WILL: We should just kill each other now and just
save the trouble. We got to plan something!

01:18:23.412 --> 01:18:25.307
LAURA: Scanlan, you do remember the flute, right?

01:18:25.307 --> 01:18:28.218
SAM: Yeah, I carry it with me always. I use it all
the time.

01:18:28.218 --> 01:18:33.181
LAURA: I wonder how long it'll take? To bamf
over when we play the flute? Is it instantaneous

01:18:33.181 --> 01:18:36.918
or is it like, it takes a day?

01:18:36.918 --> 01:18:38.400
SAM: We'll never know.

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.559
LAURA: We'll find out.

01:18:39.559 --> 01:18:40.719
(laughter)

01:18:40.719 --> 01:18:42.238
SAM: I'll be dead long before it works.

01:18:42.238 --> 01:18:44.164
TALIESIN: Six months later, "Where is everybody?"

01:18:44.164 --> 01:18:45.739
(laughter)

01:18:45.739 --> 01:18:48.565
MARISHA: I told you we were going to die if we
didn't have you.

01:18:48.565 --> 01:18:52.049
WILL: No, you're going to die even with me! But
I'm going to be the guy going, "Hey, we could have

01:18:52.049 --> 01:18:53.394
"planned this better!"

01:18:53.394 --> 01:18:54.964
MARISHA: Right, yeah.

01:18:54.964 --> 01:18:56.504
MARY: I think you've given them a really good
plan.

01:18:56.504 --> 01:18:58.031
LAURA: Yeah, no, that's great! Let's do that!

01:18:58.031 --> 01:19:03.767
TALIESIN: There is no situation that anyone is
going to come up with where we're looking good,

01:19:03.767 --> 01:19:07.497
and this is going to work well. There's just--
there's a dragon in the middle of the city with an

01:19:07.497 --> 01:19:12.436
evil army and we have to deal with it, and there's
just no positive way to deal with that.

01:19:12.436 --> 01:19:15.100
MARY: Are we taking Raishan with us?

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:17.596
SAM: Raishan, I feel like she's going to meet us
there.

01:19:17.596 --> 01:19:23.970
MARISHA: It just seems so highly defeatist to
already plan for-- you know, defeat.

01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:28.228
TALIESIN: It's not planning for defeat. It's
recognizing that no matter what, ten minutes into

01:19:28.228 --> 01:19:30.928
it, everything that we thought we knew is
going to be wrong anyway.

01:19:30.928 --> 01:19:35.113
WILL: At least tell me you're not going to send
all your forces in at the same time. You're

01:19:35.113 --> 01:19:36.205
saving a reserve.

01:19:36.205 --> 01:19:37.403
LAURA: Of course.

01:19:37.403 --> 01:19:40.570
MARISHA: Okay. Then we need to talk about the
forces that are going in. More armies are talented

01:19:40.570 --> 01:19:41.655
than others.

01:19:41.655 --> 01:19:43.616
SAM: We're not sending them all in?

01:19:43.616 --> 01:19:45.508
TALIESIN: No, we're not. We are going to surround
the city.

01:19:45.508 --> 01:19:49.258
WILL: I need one supreme general who's going to be
in charge of everything. Who stays back as we're

01:19:49.258 --> 01:19:50.462
attacking.

01:19:50.462 --> 01:19:52.784
LAURA: Daxio is going to do that.

01:19:52.784 --> 01:19:53.969
MARY: All right.

01:19:53.969 --> 01:19:55.299
WILL: And the men trust him?

01:19:55.299 --> 01:19:57.117
LAURA: Yes. He's the leader of the army.

01:19:57.117 --> 01:19:58.541
WILL: Okay.

01:19:58.541 --> 01:20:00.399
TALIESIN: He's all right.

01:20:00.399 --> 01:20:03.320
MARISHA: Then we need to get this plan to him.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.002
LAURA: Yeah, we need to talk to him.

01:20:05.002 --> 01:20:07.888
TALIESIN: We have communications.

01:20:07.888 --> 01:20:13.434
MARISHA: So we're going to have waves of assault
from one position, have other people flank in from

01:20:13.434 --> 01:20:14.498
another position--

01:20:14.498 --> 01:20:15.917
WILL: And you're attacking a fortified city?

01:20:15.917 --> 01:20:21.651
TALIESIN: Fortified-ish. Well, the hope is
actually-- also we have the 50 men from Fort

01:20:21.651 --> 01:20:24.177
Daxio. We can bring them in underground as well,
and just have them pop up--

01:20:24.177 --> 01:20:25.565
LAURA: And open the gates?

01:20:25.565 --> 01:20:28.115
TALIESIN: --all sorts of places. Also open the
gates.

01:20:28.115 --> 01:20:30.721
WILL: So you could bring forces with us to come up
in the middle of the city?

01:20:30.721 --> 01:20:31.952
LAURA: Yeah.

01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:33.816
WILL: That's good. We should have talked about
that in the beginning.

01:20:33.816 --> 01:20:37.616
SAM: I also think there's a SWAT team that's
available to us.

01:20:37.616 --> 01:20:38.811
TALIESIN: He thinks there's a SWAT team.

01:20:38.811 --> 01:20:42.531
WILL: You should-- you should talk less.

01:20:42.531 --> 01:20:43.756
SAM: Smile more?

01:20:43.756 --> 01:20:46.319
(laughter)

01:20:46.319 --> 01:20:48.091
TALIESIN: I think you smile just the right amount.

01:20:48.091 --> 01:20:59.174
MARY: I use my Awakened Mind to speak to Kash
telepathically. You can't respond out loud, so

01:20:59.174 --> 01:21:09.367
don't. You know how I feel about Raishan. You know
what I've experienced with her. Keep an eye on

01:21:09.367 --> 01:21:17.761
her. Don't trust her. If you see anything while
we're out there, you let me know and we'll take

01:21:17.761 --> 01:21:21.241
her out. All right, darling?

01:21:21.241 --> 01:21:25.650
SAM: Kash, why are you drooling and staring off
into space?

01:21:25.650 --> 01:21:27.415
(laughter)

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:28.522
WILL: Was-- was I drooling?

01:21:28.522 --> 01:21:29.623
SAM: Oh, just a little.

01:21:29.623 --> 01:21:31.132
WILL: That's my bad, I'm sorry.

01:21:31.132 --> 01:21:32.986
LAURA: You were talking so much a second ago,
and--

01:21:32.986 --> 01:21:36.759
WILL: I was thinking about how I can't wait to die
tomorrow. Yeah.

01:21:36.759 --> 01:21:41.771
SAM: Well, why don't we finalize this plan
tomorrow when we meet with the general who will

01:21:41.771 --> 01:21:44.203
be-- what, commanding half the forces?

01:21:44.203 --> 01:21:46.503
MARISHA: I think we need to meet with the general,
like, tonight.

01:21:46.503 --> 01:21:47.704
SAM: Okay. Let's go.

01:21:47.704 --> 01:21:48.970
MARISHA: Right now.

01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:51.056
TALIESIN: Meet or telepathically communicate?

01:21:51.056 --> 01:21:56.608
LAURA: I think we should send a message through
Allura. She can just scribble a note and send it

01:21:56.608 --> 01:21:57.656
to him.

01:21:57.656 --> 01:22:00.912
TALIESIN: Also that way, he'll have less time,
less effort defying us.

01:22:00.912 --> 01:22:06.117
SAM: Why-- why not go talk to him?

01:22:06.117 --> 01:22:11.402
MARISHA: Yeah. I feel like you can't really
scribble an elaborate battle plan in a 25-word

01:22:11.402 --> 01:22:12.736
message.

01:22:12.736 --> 01:22:15.677
TALIESIN: It's not written down, it's all
telepathic conversation.

01:22:15.677 --> 01:22:22.404
MARISHA: But the Message spell that Allura is
using only allows for very minimal conversation.

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:25.483
It's not exactly-- She can't have a full-blown
conversation with them.

01:22:25.483 --> 01:22:27.441
MATT: It's a long-distance Twitter.

01:22:27.441 --> 01:22:28.857
MARISHA: Yeah. A hundred percent.

01:22:28.857 --> 01:22:30.500
SAM: Let's go to him.

01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:36.207
LAURA: All right, let's go. Right now. I still
think we should eat a Heroes' Feast before we go.

01:22:36.207 --> 01:22:37.817
Just in case.

01:22:37.817 --> 01:22:40.587
SAM: When Vex wants to spend money, I'm in
agreement.

01:22:40.587 --> 01:22:42.673
LAURA: What's the difference, really? Just to be
prepared.

01:22:42.673 --> 01:22:44.447
MARISHA: Well, it blows a spell.

01:22:44.447 --> 01:22:49.558
LAURA: But the day is almost up. It will protect
us all day tomorrow.

01:22:49.558 --> 01:22:51.401
MARISHA: What time is it?

01:22:51.401 --> 01:22:56.368
MATT: After this much conversation, it's getting
closer to sunset, probably an hour after--

01:22:56.368 --> 01:22:59.409
SAM: Oi, Pike! Can you do a Heroes Feast for us?

01:22:59.409 --> 01:23:00.780
MATT: "Sure!"

01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:02.754
(laughter)

01:23:02.754 --> 01:23:04.011
SAM: Thanks, Pike!

01:23:04.011 --> 01:23:05.680
MATT: "No problem!"

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:08.009
MARY: You're so tiny, I didn't even see you.

01:23:08.009 --> 01:23:09.907
(laughter)

01:23:09.907 --> 01:23:16.688
MATT: Yeah, she then goes ahead and casts Heroes'
Feast. Same cost. Same cost as-- It also cost her

01:23:16.688 --> 01:23:19.162
6th-level spell slot. Which I'll mark.

01:23:19.162 --> 01:23:22.925
LAURA: You don't have to, we have party funds for
this, dear.

01:23:22.925 --> 01:23:28.840
MATT: All right. So Heroes' Feast has been
summoned for you guys.

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:34.248
LAURA: Did you just give me 800? I'm just pocketing
your 800, and I'm putting it in the party gold. So

01:23:34.248 --> 01:23:35.578
thank you.

01:23:35.578 --> 01:23:37.407
LIAM: It's the same thing.

01:23:37.407 --> 01:23:48.251
MATT: So you guys are going to speak to Allura,
then?

01:23:48.251 --> 01:23:50.251
SAM: No. We're doing a Heroes' Feast.

01:23:50.251 --> 01:23:52.501
WILL: I was told there was brunch.

01:23:52.501 --> 01:23:55.901
MARY: I was promised brunch!

01:23:55.901 --> 01:24:01.586
MARISHA: Do we know exactly where the Syngorn army
is? How far away from--

01:24:01.586 --> 01:24:07.179
MATT: That, you would have to talk to Allura
about. She's acting as the information nexus for

01:24:07.179 --> 01:24:12.101
everyone. It takes an hour. You all have to sit
and devour the meal for an hour, for 12 people.

01:24:12.101 --> 01:24:13.623
LAURA: Okay.

01:24:13.623 --> 01:24:19.625
MATT: For your party, your two allies there, and
Gilmore, and Jarett, Drake, anybody else you want

01:24:19.625 --> 01:24:22.495
to bring along. And as you guys, for the next 24
hours--

01:24:22.495 --> 01:24:23.712
LAURA: And Trinket.

01:24:23.712 --> 01:24:32.612
SAM: Do you need it?

01:24:32.612 --> 01:24:34.589
LAURA: No.

01:24:34.589 --> 01:24:38.710
WILL: Wait. That was you at the beginning?

01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:42.261
(laughter)

01:24:42.261 --> 01:24:44.074
LAURA: Shh-shhh--

01:24:44.074 --> 01:24:46.505
MATT: Kima-- you'd have to choose between Kima or
Jarett.

01:24:46.505 --> 01:24:47.958
TALIESIN: Or Kima or Trinket.

01:24:47.958 --> 01:24:53.368
LAURA: We have to choose between Kima and Jarett
to come? Or to eat?

01:24:53.368 --> 01:24:56.927
MATT: To eat. You only have up to 12 people for the
meal.

01:24:56.927 --> 01:24:58.548
MARISHA: Kima. She's in the fray.

01:24:58.548 --> 01:25:01.403
TALIESIN: Yeah. He can stay back, he has a
crossbow.

01:25:01.403 --> 01:25:07.668
MATT: All righty, so, that being the case, gonna
roll 2d10 to see how much everyone's maximum hit

01:25:07.668 --> 01:25:08.795
points increases.

01:25:08.795 --> 01:25:10.261
SAM: Oh, we don't need to do Grog.

01:25:10.261 --> 01:25:11.591
LAURA: Yeah, we do.

01:25:11.591 --> 01:25:12.969
SAM: He's not here.

01:25:12.969 --> 01:25:17.914
MATT: That's a really good roll. That's an eight
and a nine. So there you go. All of you gain 17

01:25:17.914 --> 01:25:21.172
additional max hit points for the next 24 hours.

01:25:21.172 --> 01:25:23.062
MARISHA: Wow, that's awesome.

01:25:23.062 --> 01:25:26.888
MATT: That's actually really, really good. So keep
a note on that.

01:25:26.888 --> 01:25:29.735
LAURA: And then we're immune to fear and poison,
right?

01:25:29.735 --> 01:25:34.300
MATT: And you're immune to poison and the poisoned
condition.

01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:37.760
SAM: And we have advantage on wisdom saving
throws.

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:41.028
MATT: All right, I'm marking this here.

01:25:41.028 --> 01:25:51.062
WILL: I feel so much healthier. And the bacon is
great. Fresh lox.

01:25:51.062 --> 01:25:53.568
SAM: Zabar's.

01:25:53.568 --> 01:25:55.510
LAURA: I'm so hungry now!

01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:59.088
MARY: Hollandaise wasn't that blender stuff, it
was the real thing.

01:25:59.088 --> 01:26:04.698
MATT: All right, so you finish your meal. You
summon Allura, she comes and enters the room. She

01:26:04.698 --> 01:26:09.982
looks a little frazzled, a little sleepless, but
she's keeping it together. "All right, what do you

01:26:09.982 --> 01:26:11.196
"require?"

01:26:11.196 --> 01:26:15.170
MARISHA: We were curious if you knew the location
of the Syngorn army?

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:22.388
MATT: "Yes, we've been keeping in contact. They
look to be arriving about early afternoon

01:26:22.388 --> 01:26:27.156
"tomorrow, at a far enough distance from Emon.
Their illusionists have been keeping a blanket in

01:26:27.156 --> 01:26:34.360
"front of the army to dissuade any visibility and
giving away their position in advance."

01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:36.022
LAURA: Oh, that's so comforting.

01:26:36.022 --> 01:26:37.731
WILL: You have numbers?

01:26:37.731 --> 01:26:43.690
MATT: "They are at-- let's see here, they're at
2,000 troops."

01:26:43.690 --> 01:26:46.631
LAURA: Okay. All right.

01:26:46.631 --> 01:26:48.955
MATT: "Give or take, and--"

01:26:48.955 --> 01:26:50.975
MARISHA: Do you know the status of the other
armies?

01:26:50.975 --> 01:26:58.112
MATT: "Well, that is the Syngorian force and the
three Daxio-- the Dusk regiment, the Tide

01:26:58.112 --> 01:27:04.877
"regiment-- The Dusk, the Gale, and the Tide
regiments with the Syngorian forces."

01:27:04.877 --> 01:27:07.021
LIAM: And all together is 2,000?

01:27:07.021 --> 01:27:08.531
MATT: "Yes. A little over 2,000."

01:27:08.531 --> 01:27:09.853
WILL: Are they all foot?

01:27:09.853 --> 01:27:16.442
MATT: "They are all foot, yes. Unfortunately, with
the time given, and the transition to and from the

01:27:16.442 --> 01:27:23.088
"Feywild, there was an inability to bring with them
most of their beasts of burden and horses. Many of

01:27:23.088 --> 01:27:26.378
"them were left to scatter shortly after the
Conclave's attack."

01:27:26.378 --> 01:27:30.606
SAM: Is there an elite SWAT team task force?

01:27:30.606 --> 01:27:35.302
MATT: "I believe that's-- there is one, and they
are called Vox Machina."

01:27:35.302 --> 01:27:37.928
MARY: I've heard of them.

01:27:37.928 --> 01:27:39.468
WILL: Are there shields?

01:27:39.468 --> 01:27:40.881
MATT: "They do have shields."

01:27:40.881 --> 01:27:42.228
WILL: How big?

01:27:42.228 --> 01:27:44.361
MATT: "Uh, depends on the regiments. I mean--"

01:27:44.361 --> 01:27:46.278
WILL: Can we form a phalanx, is my question.

01:27:46.278 --> 01:27:47.587
MATT: "I-- Yes, that is--"

01:27:47.587 --> 01:27:51.056
LIAM: He has been training military in
Whitestone.

01:27:51.056 --> 01:27:57.021
MATT: "Specifically the Tide regiment is a
frontline shield phalanx."

01:27:57.021 --> 01:27:58.428
WILL: And how big is it?

01:27:58.428 --> 01:28:03.896
MATT: "I don't actually have numbers on that.
You'd have to talk to Mikael on that. The

01:28:03.896 --> 01:28:04.868
"Warmaster."

01:28:04.868 --> 01:28:06.812
WILL: And they're going to be attacking a
fortified location?

01:28:06.812 --> 01:28:12.772
MATT: "Yes, the outer walls of Emon are guarded by
a wall. The wall has sustained damage through the

01:28:12.772 --> 01:28:17.134
"Conclave's initial attack and there has not been,
as far as I know, intent to rebuild, or at least a

01:28:17.134 --> 01:28:19.548
"force to be able to since then."

01:28:19.548 --> 01:28:25.371
LAURA: So if we could get in, talk to the Clasp,
and have them find a way to open the gates, it

01:28:25.371 --> 01:28:26.717
would help the armies.

01:28:26.717 --> 01:28:29.482
WILL: Well, that's the thing, is you'd have to
hold the gate once it's open. That's gonna be the

01:28:29.482 --> 01:28:31.762
hardest part. But 50 men could easily do that.

01:28:31.762 --> 01:28:36.707
LAURA: Plus the Clasp, which hopefully will be
willing to fight.

01:28:36.707 --> 01:28:39.511
SAM: Hey, where's our stone golem?

01:28:39.511 --> 01:28:41.428
TALIESIN: Far away.

01:28:41.428 --> 01:28:42.684
SAM: He's gone.

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:46.902
WILL: How many-- do we know the numbers that are
inside the city?

01:28:46.902 --> 01:28:57.534
MATT: "Not specifically. As far as the lizardfolk
army-- from what we've heard from Asum, from Brom,

01:28:57.534 --> 01:29:04.790
"from Raishan, the estimates are somewhere in the
neighborhood of eight to nine thousand, and at

01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:09.637
"least five to six hundred wyverns that are--"

01:29:09.637 --> 01:29:12.650
WILL: So we don't control the air?

01:29:12.650 --> 01:29:15.702
MATT: "Not on a wide scale, no."

01:29:15.702 --> 01:29:17.703
TALIESIN: We have a single battleship.

01:29:17.703 --> 01:29:24.640
WILL: We're attacking a fortified location with no
siege engines, outnumbered three to one.

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:30.308
TALIESIN: Their fortified location also does not
have siege engines, just air force.

01:29:30.308 --> 01:29:37.535
MARISHA: Their air force is also giant wyvern
beasts.

01:29:37.535 --> 01:29:42.579
MATT: "Now, understand, lizardfolk are not the
most hearty, the most well-trained. They're a

01:29:42.579 --> 01:29:47.601
"chaotic force at best and even the bit of
unification they've had under Thordak's banner is

01:29:47.601 --> 01:29:56.431
"thin. You've already had luck cutting down a few
of their main sources of tactics; I believe the

01:29:56.431 --> 01:30:03.835
"general that you slew outside of Daxio was one of
their main organisers. That's a big blow to their

01:30:03.835 --> 01:30:13.370
"tactic brigade. Who knows who else is in cahoots
with Thordak since he took power, but we've been,

01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:20.242
"in previous encounters, chipping away at their
capabilities. Thordak also does have under his

01:30:20.242 --> 01:30:25.562
"command a number of fire giants that he brought
with him from the Fire Plane. However, you also

01:30:25.562 --> 01:30:27.229
"slew their general."

01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:29.538
WILL: Are they superstitious?

01:30:29.538 --> 01:30:32.712
MATT: "Not to my knowledge, no."

01:30:32.712 --> 01:30:35.441
WILL: Any type of religion; a devil figure in
their religion?

01:30:35.441 --> 01:30:41.542
MATT: "There are. They exist among many various
devils."

01:30:41.542 --> 01:30:47.383
WILL: I'm wondering if we have the illusionist
drop the shield when the army gets there and

01:30:47.383 --> 01:30:51.140
create an illusion of one of their giant beasts
that they're afraid of on one side of the wall.

01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:54.084
Scatter fear among all of them.

01:30:54.084 --> 01:30:57.993
TALIESIN: It could work. The big fear there of
course is that they work for a creature they

01:30:57.993 --> 01:31:00.407
already fear quite a bit.

01:31:00.407 --> 01:31:04.135
LAURA: I think Thordak might be scarier than any
of their gods at this point.

01:31:04.135 --> 01:31:09.008
WILL: Thordak will be busy, hopefully. We want to
move them away from the gate so that the 50 men

01:31:09.008 --> 01:31:11.108
can come up through the city and hold the gate.

01:31:11.108 --> 01:31:14.706
TALIESIN: I think a carrot would be easier than a
stick. I think it would be better to find a force

01:31:14.706 --> 01:31:17.491
for them to rush toward, than to find something
for them rush away from.

01:31:17.491 --> 01:31:20.527
MARISHA: Do we know how many spellcasters are in
the Syngorn army?

01:31:20.527 --> 01:31:23.083
MATT: "I do not have those numbers,
unfortunately."

01:31:23.083 --> 01:31:24.949
WILL: That could be interesting.

01:31:24.949 --> 01:31:26.616
TALIESIN: More carrot, less stick.

01:31:26.616 --> 01:31:30.217
WILL: You might not even need to see the soldiers,
just the dust rising from their boots.

01:31:30.217 --> 01:31:34.128
MARY: And the horses charging, if you can make
that kind of illusion.

01:31:34.128 --> 01:31:36.078
MARISHA: We need to figure out how many
spellcasters.

01:31:36.078 --> 01:31:39.710
MATT: "That would be a conversation with the
Warmaster."

01:31:39.710 --> 01:31:45.271
MARISHA: They can throw down long-range, large,
covering spells.

01:31:45.271 --> 01:31:47.066
SAM: Let's go talk to the Warmaster.

01:31:47.066 --> 01:31:49.581
LAURA: Well we don't know where they'll be exactly
until tomorrow.

01:31:49.581 --> 01:31:53.775
MATT: "Have that conversation at the ready."

01:31:53.775 --> 01:32:03.347
MARISHA: All right, hang on, how about this? We
know that they're to arrive in Emon by the

01:32:03.347 --> 01:32:10.533
afternoon. We can just try to connect with them in
the early morning and march in with them, then

01:32:10.533 --> 01:32:12.703
split when we get closer to the gates.

01:32:12.703 --> 01:32:14.669
TALIESIN: And then meet the 50 men at Greyskull
Keep.

01:32:14.669 --> 01:32:17.319
WILL: Do we have access to anything that goes
boom?

01:32:17.319 --> 01:32:23.151
TALIESIN: A little bit. Do I have anything
possibly still leftover at Greyskull, any of my

01:32:23.151 --> 01:32:24.445
supplies?

01:32:24.445 --> 01:32:31.150
MATT: You do have a small cache of blackpowder at
your disposal. It's about a cask.

01:32:31.150 --> 01:32:34.951
TALIESIN: I make it myself, half the time.

01:32:34.951 --> 01:32:37.465
WILL: A cask in the right place against an already
damaged wall could punch a hole.

01:32:37.465 --> 01:32:38.823
TALIESIN: It could.

01:32:38.823 --> 01:32:44.193
WILL: And if we're underneath, and the foundation
is already weakened, we'd be trapped but the army

01:32:44.193 --> 01:32:45.531
could get inside.

01:32:45.531 --> 01:32:47.589
TALIESIN: Do you still have that siege arrow or is
that gone now?

01:32:47.589 --> 01:32:55.396
LAURA: I do, I have a siege arrow. And Grog does
extra damage against buildings and walls.

01:32:55.396 --> 01:33:00.812
MATT: "Yes I do!" (boom) slams his fists together,
and as they hit you hear what sounds like a very

01:33:00.812 --> 01:33:05.631
localized sound of a rockslide. Just like (boom).

01:33:05.631 --> 01:33:07.234
MARISHA: Rad.

01:33:07.234 --> 01:33:14.127
TALIESIN: So we do have a siege arrow which will
basically do the damage of-- It's a

01:33:14.127 --> 01:33:19.843
wall-shatterer. It's designed to bring down
stone.

01:33:19.843 --> 01:33:24.066
LAURA: So it damages stone, specifically? The
siege arrow?

01:33:24.066 --> 01:33:32.863
MATT: Yes. It damages anything that is liable to
siege.

01:33:33.009 --> 01:33:35.143
WILL: And it can be fired by anybody?

01:33:35.143 --> 01:33:39.646
TALIESIN: Yes, but it is weirdly weighted and
she's probably the one you want firing it.

01:33:39.646 --> 01:33:41.516
LAURA: I'm a really good archer.

01:33:41.516 --> 01:33:44.066
WILL: I remember, when I brought you back from the
dead.

01:33:44.066 --> 01:33:45.660
LAURA: Yeah, oh my god thank you so much.

01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:47.023
WILL: You're welcome, not a problem.

01:33:47.023 --> 01:33:52.621
MARY: What am I, chopped liver? I get nothing? I
think it was both of us, I believe.

01:33:52.621 --> 01:33:54.433
WILL: That could be interesting, though.

01:33:54.433 --> 01:33:56.562
TALIESIN: Yes it could. I'd forgotten about that.

01:33:56.562 --> 01:34:00.349
WILL: Well because what they'll be expecting is
for 50 men to come in and hold the gate. What if

01:34:00.349 --> 01:34:06.169
holding the gate is actually a distraction? And
then we punch a hole through the wall and go in

01:34:06.169 --> 01:34:07.241
the back door.

01:34:07.241 --> 01:34:08.492
LAURA: Yes. I like it.

01:34:08.492 --> 01:34:13.650
WILL: But we're going to be in the tunnel, we're
working about the top right now.

01:34:13.650 --> 01:34:18.809
MARY: But if we can scatter their forces front and
back, we'll have the center to come in underneath,

01:34:18.809 --> 01:34:22.007
and that way if they figure it out they'll have to
come from either side.

01:34:22.007 --> 01:34:26.270
WILL: The 50 men holding the wall, the chances of
any of them getting out are slim, but they're

01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:27.582
going to know that going in.

01:34:27.582 --> 01:34:28.970
LAURA: These guys are legit!

01:34:28.970 --> 01:34:31.591
SAM: We are the worst people.

01:34:31.591 --> 01:34:34.456
LAURA: Apparently! Which is terrible. It really,
really is.

01:34:34.456 --> 01:34:36.379
WILL: It's the end of the world, they know what's
happened.

01:34:36.379 --> 01:34:39.115
MARY: You've been dealing with dragons, we've been
thinking about it.

01:34:39.115 --> 01:34:42.856
MARISHA: I'm still concerned we don't have enough
air support for the 500 wyverns.

01:34:42.856 --> 01:34:45.774
MARY: I think we might have to let that go.

01:34:45.774 --> 01:34:50.355
MATT: Allura chimes in and goes, "As far as I
understand, that's part of the reason you're

01:34:50.355 --> 01:34:51.751
"bringing the mages with you."

01:34:51.751 --> 01:34:53.847
MARISHA: Yes, well I'm thinking--

01:34:53.847 --> 01:34:55.194
TALIESIN: Ground to air.

01:34:55.194 --> 01:34:56.694
WILL: How big is the airship?

01:34:56.694 --> 01:35:00.423
MARISHA: I wasn't wanting to necessarily tap into
this resource unless necessary, but I think it's

01:35:00.423 --> 01:35:06.975
necessary. I can contact the Air Ashari and have
them specifically on air support.

01:35:06.975 --> 01:35:09.181
LIAM: And they can get themselves here quick, like
you?

01:35:09.181 --> 01:35:11.219
LAURA: They can go through trees, instant!

01:35:11.219 --> 01:35:14.226
TALIESIN: It can hold two dozen people on that
ship, right?

01:35:14.226 --> 01:35:15.795
LAURA: We need all of the Ashari.

01:35:15.795 --> 01:35:17.789
TALIESIN: It's about three cannonade?

01:35:17.789 --> 01:35:22.286
MARY: Is there anyone that could put an illusion
on the airship to make it seem like another

01:35:22.286 --> 01:35:23.459
dragon?

01:35:23.459 --> 01:35:27.811
SAM: I could put a slight illusion on it but it'd
be pretty easy--

01:35:27.811 --> 01:35:34.432
WILL: I'm just wondering if there's a way to draw
their air force to the airship and then blow it up?

01:35:34.432 --> 01:35:39.336
LIAM: We also supposedly have a green dragon as an
ally.

01:35:39.336 --> 01:35:40.750
SAM: Oh yeah!

01:35:40.750 --> 01:35:46.519
LAURA: I fucking forgot the Ravenites said they
would help us, too! I just remembered.

01:35:46.519 --> 01:35:48.993
SAM: Well, we sent word to them, didn't we? Didn't
we send word to everybody?

01:35:48.993 --> 01:35:53.743
MATT: You sent word to a few specific entities,
not the Ravenites.

01:35:53.743 --> 01:35:55.604
LAURA: How long would it take?

01:35:55.604 --> 01:35:59.275
TALIESIN: Vox Machina, swearing that they're going
to call you back for four years.

01:35:59.275 --> 01:36:02.030
(laughter)

01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:04.978
LAURA: Fuck. Are they too far?

01:36:04.978 --> 01:36:09.093
MATT: They're like a continent away.

01:36:09.093 --> 01:36:11.160
WILL: Wait, you can bring in air force?

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:14.785
MARISHA: I can contact my father at the Air
Ashari.

01:36:14.785 --> 01:36:20.057
SAM: Do that. We also need to contact Gilmore.

01:36:20.057 --> 01:36:22.174
WILL: If you control the air, you control the
battle.

01:36:22.174 --> 01:36:24.928
MATT: "Gilmore is accompanying you, and I believe
Kima is going to come along as well".

01:36:24.928 --> 01:36:26.436
TALIESIN: We also have your friend.

01:36:26.436 --> 01:36:31.856
MATT: "The airship we don't know quite exactly
where it is and when it will arrive. I don't know

01:36:31.856 --> 01:36:35.455
"if we can count on it being there by the time you
make this assault, but they're going there as soon

01:36:35.455 --> 01:36:36.591
"as they can."

01:36:36.591 --> 01:36:40.661
TALIESIN: It has cannonade as well and it is
designed to hold sieges in the air, so it will

01:36:40.661 --> 01:36:43.421
keep many of them busy, and they're not that
bright.

01:36:43.421 --> 01:36:45.970
WILL: If it's not coming though, you can't count
it among them.

01:36:45.970 --> 01:36:48.289
TALIESIN: We can't count on anything.That would
be--

01:36:48.289 --> 01:36:50.597
WILL: Huge.

01:36:50.597 --> 01:36:52.657
MARISHA: Can you message Korren?

01:36:52.657 --> 01:36:55.134
MATT: "I've not met Korren."

01:36:55.134 --> 01:36:56.552
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

01:36:56.552 --> 01:36:59.812
MATT: "If you could take me to him--"

01:36:59.812 --> 01:37:10.420
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Yeah, right. Yes. Because we're
not leaving until the morning now. Sure, yeah. Oh

01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:15.196
man (gasps) who wants to go see my hometown, you
guys?

01:37:15.196 --> 01:37:16.471
SAM: (dubious noise)

01:37:16.471 --> 01:37:22.541
MARISHA: Okay. You know what? I wasn't looking at
you, Scanlan. Okay.

01:37:22.689 --> 01:37:25.054
I can show you where I went to school!

01:37:25.054 --> 01:37:28.352
MARY: Keyleth, we need to get back here as soon as
possible.

01:37:28.352 --> 01:37:30.136
WILL: You went to school?

01:37:30.136 --> 01:37:35.389
(laughter)

01:37:35.389 --> 01:37:38.162
LIAM: That was catty.

01:37:38.162 --> 01:37:41.613
TALIESIN: We were like back in school suddenly,
that was great!

01:37:41.613 --> 01:37:44.051
WILL: I formally apologize.

01:37:44.051 --> 01:37:46.218
TALIESIN: That went so John Hughes, so quickly.

01:37:46.218 --> 01:37:48.173
(laughter)

01:37:48.173 --> 01:37:49.878
LAURA: Are we expecting you back tonight?

01:37:49.878 --> 01:37:55.007
MARY: And the rest of us can rest, yes?

01:37:55.007 --> 01:37:58.702
MATT: "Rest and prepare for everything you can,
for tomorrow this happens."

01:37:58.702 --> 01:38:00.524
(liquid pouring)

01:38:00.524 --> 01:38:03.448
TALIESIN: I swear if you're aerating wine under
there I'm going to be so upset.

01:38:03.448 --> 01:38:07.082
(laughter)

01:38:07.082 --> 01:38:10.015
WILL: I just saw it out of the corner, it was
great!

01:38:10.015 --> 01:38:14.236
MATT: All you had to do was ask, I'm working
toward getting the break, buddy!

01:38:14.236 --> 01:38:16.452
SAM: (sigh) Feels so much better!

01:38:16.452 --> 01:38:24.615
MARY: Before we go to bed, I would like to talk to
Vex very quickly.

01:38:24.615 --> 01:38:29.357
MATT: As you guys are going to prepare to make
your way to the Air Ashari, Zahra pulls you

01:38:29.357 --> 01:38:30.528
aside.

01:38:30.528 --> 01:38:31.728
MARY: Darling?

01:38:31.728 --> 01:38:32.571
LAURA: Yes?

01:38:32.571 --> 01:38:40.689
MARY: I have major concerns about Raishan. I don't
know that we can trust her, I just want you to

01:38:40.689 --> 01:38:52.299
keep your eyes on her. While you were gone, I
tried as hard as I could to glean anything from

01:38:52.299 --> 01:39:00.957
her, and the closer I thought I got-- I found out
that I knew nothing about her. And she knows

01:39:00.957 --> 01:39:03.618
everything about me.

01:39:03.618 --> 01:39:06.578
LAURA: She knows everything about all of us,
dear.

01:39:06.578 --> 01:39:08.105
MARY: Don't trust her.

01:39:08.105 --> 01:39:09.810
LAURA: Not even for a minute.

01:39:09.810 --> 01:39:17.307
MARY: Don't trust her. If it comes to it, I'll go
down taking her out.

01:39:17.307 --> 01:39:19.544
LAURA: I'd rather you didn't.

01:39:19.544 --> 01:39:21.427
MARY: So would I.

01:39:21.427 --> 01:39:26.510
LAURA: I have to do it, I have to insight check
Zahra to make sure she's really Zahra!

01:39:26.510 --> 01:39:28.189
SAM: Oh shit.

01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:29.684
MATT: Make an insight check.

01:39:29.684 --> 01:39:31.489
LIAM: No that's good. That's good.

01:39:31.489 --> 01:39:33.142
LAURA: I love you.

01:39:33.142 --> 01:39:35.980
LIAM: Pretty good.

01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:39.920
TALIESIN: I can also say there's an easy way to do
this--

01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:42.187
MATT: Turn that way real fast.

01:39:42.187 --> 01:39:48.469
TALIESIN: Just go downstairs.

01:39:48.469 --> 01:39:58.954
SAM: (in surfer accent) Hey guys, don't forget:

01:39:58.954 --> 01:40:05.943

01:40:05.943 --> 01:40:15.445

role' for 10% off, my bruh!

01:40:15.445 --> 01:40:19.531
MATT: That's the worst use of Seeming I've ever
seen!

01:40:19.531 --> 01:40:21.799
(laughter)

01:40:21.799 --> 01:40:23.361
MATT: All righty.

01:40:23.361 --> 01:40:27.420
LAURA: When did you even speak to her?

01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:32.791
MARY: While you were gone. You know I've been
spending time-- she's been down in the ziggurat.

01:40:32.791 --> 01:40:34.351
LAURA: Yes?

01:40:34.351 --> 01:40:39.973
MARY: So I've seen her. I've seen her form, as I
guess you have as well.

01:40:39.973 --> 01:40:41.345
LAURA: Yes.

01:40:41.345 --> 01:40:46.448
MARY: After Rimefang, I sort of became obsessed
with dragons.

01:40:46.448 --> 01:40:49.601
LAURA: I know the feeling. (laughs)

01:40:49.601 --> 01:40:55.136
MARY: Yes, it's a wonderful feeling, isn't it? But
I also know that she was part of it, and the

01:40:55.136 --> 01:40:57.508
minute a dragon says 'trust me' is the minute you
don't.

01:40:57.508 --> 01:40:58.853
LAURA: Especially her.

01:40:58.853 --> 01:41:05.145
MARY: Especially her. So while you were gone, I
tried. I tried to find out as much about Thordak

01:41:05.145 --> 01:41:06.681
as I could.

01:41:06.681 --> 01:41:10.485
LAURA: Just know that we don't trust her.

01:41:10.485 --> 01:41:12.525
MARY: All right.

01:41:12.525 --> 01:41:15.109
LAURA: I don't even know if she's really sick.

01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:27.937
MARY: I actually believe her in that respect. But
Thordak is the only one that can cure her, and if

01:41:27.937 --> 01:41:35.990
that's the case-- if she believes that-- then we
are nothing. We are expendable to her the minute

01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:43.959
she sees Thordak. That's the carrot that he has
put in front of her, is that 'I will heal you',

01:41:43.959 --> 01:41:47.367
and he hasn't done it yet. I don't think he will.

01:41:47.367 --> 01:41:49.619
LAURA: I don't think he really can.

01:41:49.619 --> 01:41:57.398
MARY: If he does, we're fucked. That's all.

01:41:57.398 --> 01:42:01.036
LAURA: You're not alone in this, at least.

01:42:01.036 --> 01:42:03.087
MARY: Good. That's good.

01:42:03.087 --> 01:42:05.233
LAURA: She's not our friend.

01:42:05.233 --> 01:42:13.010
MARY: She can be persuasive. Thank you, darling.

01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:18.627
MATT: You separate for the evening to gather your
mind, gather your supplies and prepare for the

01:42:18.627 --> 01:42:24.211
coming battle. While the rest of you find
yourselves resting for the evening, Keyleth and

01:42:24.211 --> 01:42:27.570
Vax find yourselves walking towards the Sun Tree
to make your journey.

01:42:27.570 --> 01:42:29.399
MARISHA: Is Allura coming with us, too?

01:42:29.399 --> 01:42:30.664
MATT: If you want to ask her to come with you.

01:42:30.664 --> 01:42:31.992
MARISHA: I thought she was.

01:42:31.992 --> 01:42:33.833
MATT: I'm sorry, yeah.

01:42:33.833 --> 01:42:36.007
MARISHA: She doesn't have to.

01:42:36.007 --> 01:42:37.604
MATT: You're right, no, she goes with you.

01:42:37.604 --> 01:42:39.007
MARISHA: Okay, come on, Allura, let's go!

01:42:39.007 --> 01:42:40.594
MATT: "Of course! Certainly."

01:42:40.594 --> 01:42:44.071
MARISHA: It's great, we have these really great
crepes that we make. It's like our hometown

01:42:44.071 --> 01:42:45.157
special.

01:42:45.157 --> 01:42:47.951
MATT: "If there's time, I would love to have some.
Don't know if we'll have time."

01:42:47.951 --> 01:42:49.202
MARISHA: Okay, okay!

01:42:49.202 --> 01:42:56.285
MATT: So you all walk your way down to the Sun
Tree. You open the portal. Immediately on the

01:42:56.285 --> 01:43:05.509
opposite side you see-- as it is nighttime in this
part of Exandria's hemisphere-- what looks to be a

01:43:05.509 --> 01:43:15.568
beautiful, simple village made of curved wood,
almost dome-type structures, but not huts, there's

01:43:15.568 --> 01:43:21.836
no thatch. They're really well-crafted, long,
intricate strips of wood like it's been grown to a

01:43:21.836 --> 01:43:26.014
specific shape. It creates these interesting
domiciles that are all built, you see beyond that,

01:43:26.014 --> 01:43:32.179
on the edge of a sheer cliff, and the minute you step
through the wind hits you. There is a strong wind

01:43:32.179 --> 01:43:36.736
immediately on the outside of this tree, and you
feel your cloak being blown to the side. You look

01:43:36.736 --> 01:43:41.886
over behind the tree that you just stepped out of,
and it's another cliff that vanishes into darkness

01:43:41.886 --> 01:43:49.837
below. The Air Ashari village of Zephrah lies at
the very top of this mountain range. For a brief

01:43:49.837 --> 01:43:55.117
second, you get vertigo, glancing over your
shoulder. Keyleth steps through with a big smile

01:43:55.117 --> 01:44:03.885
on her face. You see Allura step through, and as
soon as she sees this happen she clasps and keeps

01:44:03.885 --> 01:44:10.270
her hair down, not wanting to be like you right
now with your hair (blowing) in the wind.

01:44:10.270 --> 01:44:19.845
You take a few steps toward the village. Probably
close to 100 homes at most, built into the

01:44:19.845 --> 01:44:25.594
mountainside. It goes up into a hill with trees
that surround the outskirts of it. You see small

01:44:25.594 --> 01:44:32.352
lights that are lit throughout so it has this
firefly feel glimmering through. As soon as you

01:44:32.352 --> 01:44:36.698
step maybe ten or 15 feet from the tree, the wind
just stops.

01:44:36.698 --> 01:44:41.154
LIAM: What happened to the wind?

01:44:41.154 --> 01:44:46.014
MARISHA: I mean, we're Air Ashari, we don't have
to live in a hellscape our whole lives! Come on,

01:44:46.014 --> 01:44:50.959
we control it, it's great! (sighs) Doesn't it
smell good? It smells so fresh up here, you know?

01:44:50.959 --> 01:44:55.634
You don't have to deal with the pollution down
there. Oh look! Over there, that's where I learned

01:44:55.634 --> 01:44:58.135
to shapeshift into a squirrel for the first
time--

01:44:58.135 --> 01:45:00.391
MATT: "Keyleth? Keyleth. We're here on
business--"

01:45:00.391 --> 01:45:02.663
MARISHA: Yeah no, then let's start walking!

01:45:02.663 --> 01:45:04.091
MATT: "Please lead on."

01:45:04.091 --> 01:45:08.757
MARISHA: Okay, yeah. And over there was the first
time that my dad taught me how to fly. He just

01:45:08.757 --> 01:45:10.085
pushed me off the cliff--!

01:45:10.085 --> 01:45:11.832
LIAM: I have my hand on her back and I just
start--

01:45:11.832 --> 01:45:13.411
MATT: (laughing) Pushing her forward?

01:45:13.411 --> 01:45:21.872
You eventually make your way back. There are a
number of trees that are grown through some of the

01:45:21.872 --> 01:45:28.192
buildings, or buildings are built around them, or
from them. It's a very beautiful, simple,

01:45:28.192 --> 01:45:36.619
natural-looking series of structures that are all
so smooth in their design that it was obviously

01:45:36.619 --> 01:45:39.690
bent with some druidic magic to craft this space.

01:45:39.690 --> 01:45:46.722
Currently there is nobody you see visible walking
through the city, most everything is closed off

01:45:46.722 --> 01:45:53.448
for the night. The little lantern-like lights you
saw before are coming from the inside of these

01:45:53.448 --> 01:45:55.017
buildings.

01:45:55.017 --> 01:45:58.652
MARISHA: It's a quiet mountain town, everything
closes at like five, it was actually annoying

01:45:58.652 --> 01:45:59.941
growing up.

01:45:59.941 --> 01:46:02.615
MARY: You live in South Pointe?

01:46:02.615 --> 01:46:08.743
LIAM: That explains so much.

01:46:08.743 --> 01:46:12.221
(laughter)

01:46:12.221 --> 01:46:15.483
MARISHA: I told you it was remote!

01:46:15.483 --> 01:46:18.530
MATT: I want both of you to roll a perception
check.

01:46:18.530 --> 01:46:24.541
MARISHA: 14 total.

01:46:24.541 --> 01:46:25.957
LIAM: 22.

01:46:25.957 --> 01:46:31.633
MATT: Okay. As she's talking and you guys are
walking, you notice a little dark spot, just

01:46:31.633 --> 01:46:36.939
covering past the stars, arcing quickly in your
direction.

01:46:36.939 --> 01:46:42.841
LIAM: I spin her around and tilt her head back.
What's that? Do you know what that is? Is that

01:46:42.841 --> 01:46:43.956
normal?

01:46:43.956 --> 01:46:45.567
MARISHA: Do I know what that is, is that normal?

01:46:45.567 --> 01:46:57.944
MATT: Once you see it, you recognize the
trajectory of it. This is a person rocketing

01:46:57.944 --> 01:46:59.315
toward you.

01:46:59.315 --> 01:47:00.626
MARISHA: Oh, that's a person!

01:47:00.626 --> 01:47:02.784
(laughter)

01:47:02.784 --> 01:47:05.189
MARISHA: No really, is this normal?

01:47:05.189 --> 01:47:10.107
MATT: It's normal for you, because this is a
person riding a skysail.

01:47:10.107 --> 01:47:14.736
MARISHA: Oh, it is normal for me? Oh, like a--?
Yeah!

01:47:14.736 --> 01:47:28.911
MATT: As the person swoops up and then lands--
it's a sort of glider. It resembles a pogo stick

01:47:28.911 --> 01:47:32.691
in the fact that feet are placed on top of it, and
elements are grasped on the side. It's a large,

01:47:32.691 --> 01:47:40.960
leather-winged structure that immediately folds up
and is held like a staff to the side.

01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:43.482
LIAM: Whoa, that's nifty! Hi!

01:47:43.482 --> 01:47:48.542
MATT: Standing before you is Korren, your father.

01:47:48.542 --> 01:47:50.168
MARISHA: Dad!

01:47:50.168 --> 01:47:55.537
MATT: He looks surprised. He lands in a very
aggressive, coming-to-see-what's-going-on-type

01:47:55.537 --> 01:48:00.166
way, and as soon as he looks, "Keyleth! I wasn't
expecting--"

01:48:00.166 --> 01:48:09.593
MARSIHA: Hi! Village looks great! I see you guys
have been keeping up with the landscaping, this is

01:48:09.593 --> 01:48:11.557
awesome. Hi, how are you?

01:48:11.557 --> 01:48:18.435
MATT: He hugs you, but it's a tense hug and he
pats your shoulder. "We're good. I--"

01:48:18.435 --> 01:48:20.152
MARISHA: What's wrong?

01:48:20.152 --> 01:48:31.637
MATT: "Well, things as they are, I know you're
probably here for not a passing visit. Am I

01:48:31.637 --> 01:48:33.593
"correct in this assumption?"

01:48:33.593 --> 01:48:38.181
MARISHA: I mean, I guess you could say it was
going to be passing in that we don't have a lot of

01:48:38.181 --> 01:48:42.169
time. We're here to ask for help, for the Air
Ashari's aid.

01:48:42.169 --> 01:48:51.645
MATT: "We were waiting for specific word based on
our last conversation. We have ways of finding

01:48:51.645 --> 01:48:56.187
"information about what's going on in the world,
with the armies that have been mounting making

01:48:56.187 --> 01:49:00.918
"their way towards Emon we've been keeping a watch
on the gathering energy toward the west coast of

01:49:00.918 --> 01:49:09.821
"Tal'dorei. We were preparing ourselves. So if
you've come to ask for our aid, we're ready."

01:49:09.821 --> 01:49:12.742
MARISHA: Why do I sense trepidation in your
voice?

01:49:12.742 --> 01:49:18.955
MATT: "Because we know what we face. Because my
daughter is going to war against something that we

01:49:18.955 --> 01:49:31.119
"watched tear through the countryside not long
after you were born. I'm just concerned as a

01:49:31.119 --> 01:49:34.082
"parent. That is all."

01:49:34.082 --> 01:49:44.062
MARISHA: You sent me on this path to prove myself
worthy and a hero. I'm following what I thought

01:49:44.062 --> 01:49:45.555
you wanted of me.

01:49:45.555 --> 01:49:51.727
MATT: "You are, and I'm proud of you. I just want
to do what I can to help safeguard that."

01:49:51.727 --> 01:50:04.727
MARISHA: I will continue my duties as I promised
from the beginning.

01:50:04.727 --> 01:50:06.674
MATT: "Of course".

01:50:06.674 --> 01:50:09.131
MARISHA: As those supersede being your daughter.

01:50:09.131 --> 01:50:10.701
MATT: "Of course."

01:50:10.701 --> 01:50:24.234
MARISHA: And I am here for unfortunate reasons,
and I wish I wasn't. We need the best. We need as

01:50:24.234 --> 01:50:36.767
many of the top soldiers that we have. I'm looking
at you, at my people, for air support. There's

01:50:36.767 --> 01:50:44.756
about five, maybe six hundred, maybe even more
wyverns covering the city. So far we don't have a

01:50:44.756 --> 01:50:46.319
lot of options.

01:50:46.319 --> 01:50:58.327
MATT: "We know wyverns well, that's the good news.
We can probably facilitate this request."

01:50:58.327 --> 01:51:05.058
MARISHA: I was hoping maybe some of the best
nature manipulators could create a hazardous storm

01:51:05.058 --> 01:51:08.335
ahead of time? See what we can do to take out as
much in bulk.

01:51:08.335 --> 01:51:10.201
MATT: "We can do that. Yeah."

01:51:10.201 --> 01:51:11.759
SAM: (whispering) She went to school.

01:51:11.759 --> 01:51:13.798
MARISHA: I know, I got educated!

01:51:13.798 --> 01:51:20.028
MATT: "We can do that. When is this set to
happen?"

01:51:20.028 --> 01:51:23.409
MARISHA: Tomorrow afternoon.

01:51:23.409 --> 01:51:31.461
MATT: "All right, we'll get our conjurers together
and begin building a storm front. We'll send it

01:51:31.461 --> 01:51:38.054
"mid-day tomorrow. Then what sign should we look
for to enter the fray?"

01:51:38.054 --> 01:51:40.874
MARISHA: Oh shit.

01:51:40.874 --> 01:51:42.559
SAM: Just anything.

01:51:42.559 --> 01:51:47.238
LIAM: A flare, we have flares. Kiki, we have
flares.

01:51:47.238 --> 01:51:51.695
MARISHA: We have flares.

01:51:51.695 --> 01:51:54.443
(laughter)

01:51:54.443 --> 01:51:56.060
MATT: "Very well."

01:51:56.060 --> 01:52:00.120
(laughter)

01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:08.663
MARISHA: We're spitballing this as we go, dad. So
we can work on a sign together, right?

01:52:08.663 --> 01:52:18.780
MATT: "Sure, I mean, if we're creating a sky of
rain and darkness, just make the sky itself a sign."

01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:21.147
MARISHA: I can do that.

01:52:21.147 --> 01:52:23.721
MATT: "All right. Something I'd know, something
I'd recognize."

01:52:23.721 --> 01:52:25.023
MARISHA: Okay.

01:52:25.023 --> 01:52:29.473
MATT: "We'll go in there and tear as many of those
wyverns as we can to the ground."

01:52:29.473 --> 01:52:34.987
LIAM: You're not alone, there is an army of elves
marching as we speak.

01:52:34.987 --> 01:52:37.570
MARISHA: The Syngorn army.

01:52:37.570 --> 01:52:43.427
MATT: "We've seen them traversing. Their illusions
are strong but their illusions are faced towards

01:52:43.427 --> 01:52:51.959
"the city. We have the luxury of knowing their
magic. So, yes."

01:52:51.959 --> 01:52:59.239
MARISHA: With all due respect, if you have seen
through their illusion, does that mean-- I'm sure

01:52:59.239 --> 01:53:01.985
many of Thordak's spies could do the same?

01:53:01.985 --> 01:53:06.621
MATT: "It depends on who he has on his side. I
hope that's not the case."

01:53:06.621 --> 01:53:13.581
MARISHA: Yeah, me too. Are you going to come as
well?

01:53:13.581 --> 01:53:23.651
MATT: "I do not wish to live in a world where the
dangers that continue to press upon the free

01:53:23.651 --> 01:53:29.456
"peoples of this or any land draws my daughter to
the front lines to fight, kill, and possibly die,

01:53:29.456 --> 01:53:33.265
"and I stay back and do nothing. So yes, I will be
there."

01:53:33.265 --> 01:53:40.740
MARISHA What about Zephrah? What about the
village? Who is going to watch it while you're gone?

01:53:40.740 --> 01:53:48.377
MATT: "We have enough to spare for this and
protect our people. Besides, as you well know, the

01:53:48.377 --> 01:53:53.897
"protections in this village prevent wayward
fliers."

01:53:53.897 --> 01:54:02.270
MARISHA: Okay. This is Vax, by the way.

01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:03.603
MATT: "We've met."

01:54:03.603 --> 01:54:05.208
MARISHA: Yeah, you have.

01:54:05.208 --> 01:54:06.909
MATT: "Good to see you."

01:54:06.909 --> 01:54:19.572
MARISHA: He came with me. So--? Yeah. See you
tomorrow, I guess?

01:54:19.572 --> 01:54:21.599
MATT: "See you tomorrow."

01:54:21.599 --> 01:54:26.335
LIAM: A great many people are grateful for your
aid, as am I.

01:54:26.335 --> 01:54:29.988
MATT: "And I'm grateful for yours."

01:54:29.988 --> 01:54:33.097
LIAM: You're a good man.

01:54:33.097 --> 01:54:36.618
MATT: "Prove to me you're one as well."

01:54:36.618 --> 01:54:41.544
(laughter)

01:54:41.544 --> 01:54:47.931
TALIESIN: Cleaning the shotgun.

01:54:47.931 --> 01:54:50.555
MATT: "But we have a lot to plan, I'm sure you do
as well."

01:54:50.555 --> 01:54:51.810
MARISHA: Yes.

01:54:51.810 --> 01:54:57.970
MATT: "Good night." He pulls you in and kisses you
on the forehead, and gives you a long look.

01:54:57.970 --> 01:55:01.269
MARISHA: I just give him a big hug in response.

01:55:01.269 --> 01:55:09.134
MATT: He holds you there for a second, then looks
back over at you as he's holding her.

01:55:09.134 --> 01:55:11.354
LIAM: I just nod my head.

01:55:11.354 --> 01:55:12.913
MARISHA: I miss you, Dad.

01:55:12.913 --> 01:55:22.940
MATT: "I miss you, too. When all this is done, do
you still intend to finish your Aramente? Do it

01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:26.030
"quickly. Come back to us, please. You're missed."

01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:30.608
MARISHA: You have my word. I won't let you down.

01:55:30.608 --> 01:55:39.996
MATT: "I know. Anyway." He slams on the ground and
the leather flares out into arcing-looking

01:55:39.996 --> 01:55:44.430
fingers, and he steps on.

01:55:44.430 --> 01:55:47.843
MARISHA: Are these the new models? They've really
upgraded them.

01:55:47.843 --> 01:55:49.660
MATT: "No, you've just been gone for a while."

01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:50.914
MARISHA: Have I been gone that long?

01:55:50.914 --> 01:55:52.307
MATT: "You've been gone a while."

01:55:52.307 --> 01:55:53.618
MARISHA: Well, they look great!

01:55:53.618 --> 01:55:54.599
MATT: "Thank you."

01:55:54.599 --> 01:55:56.558
MARISHA: Okay, all right, okay, bye.

01:55:56.558 --> 01:56:04.418
MATT: "Good night." As the wind picks up under
him, the skysail begins to lift and glide off. He

01:56:04.418 --> 01:56:06.400
heads back toward the village.

01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:11.846
LIAM: That is fucking cool. We should get out of
here.

01:56:11.846 --> 01:56:13.632
MARISHA: Yeah, we should.

01:56:13.632 --> 01:56:15.913
LIAM: Allura?

01:56:15.913 --> 01:56:19.184
MATT: "Yes, I believe we should. Well, it was nice
to meet him."

01:56:19.184 --> 01:56:22.923
MARISHA: Yeah, that's right. Sorry, I should have
introduced you, I guess.

01:56:22.923 --> 01:56:24.221
MATT: "I was waiting."

01:56:24.221 --> 01:56:31.207
(laughter)

01:56:31.207 --> 01:56:37.808
MATT: "As are the expected pleasantries of
diplomacy. But it seems you had it all taken care

01:56:37.808 --> 01:56:39.299
"of, so it's fine."

01:56:39.299 --> 01:56:43.494
MARISHA: Sorry, I got distracted by talking to you
as my father and not as Allura!

01:56:43.494 --> 01:56:47.601
LIAM: It was so weird though, you were standing
directly behind him.

01:56:47.601 --> 01:56:51.407
(laughter)

01:56:51.407 --> 01:56:57.402
MATT: "It's all right, don't worry, it is a bit
cold, if we could get back please?" She's rubbing

01:56:57.402 --> 01:56:59.651
her shoulders and arms a bit.

01:56:59.651 --> 01:57:02.742
MARISHA: That was my dad, let's go.

01:57:02.742 --> 01:57:07.374
MATT: All right, you guys head back, exiting out
the Sun Tree, making your way back.

01:57:07.374 --> 01:57:15.109
LIAM: I catch her by the arm. I can't wait to come
back. Let's go!

01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:18.161
MARISHA: When we come back, I'll have to show you
the first time I--

01:57:18.161 --> 01:57:19.816
LIAM: Let's go! Let's go, please!

01:57:19.816 --> 01:57:21.879
(laughter)

01:57:21.879 --> 01:57:27.497
MATT: You make your way back to castle Whitestone,
preparing your materials, your weapons, your minds

01:57:27.497 --> 01:57:29.949
and your disposition for the coming war tomorrow.

01:57:29.949 --> 01:57:31.619
TALIESIN: I have a quick thing!

01:57:31.619 --> 01:57:34.366
SAM: Shit, Taliesin, shit!

01:57:34.366 --> 01:57:37.826
TALIESIN: I knock on Vex's door. I have a bag, and
I go to Vex's door and knock on her door.

01:57:37.826 --> 01:57:39.935
LAURA: Hello, who is it?

01:57:39.935 --> 01:57:41.590
SAM: It's a bag of dicks.

01:57:41.590 --> 01:57:46.558
TALIESIN: You're terrible. It's me, I have
something to show you.

01:57:46.558 --> 01:57:48.065
LAURA: (faux surprise) Percy?

01:57:48.065 --> 01:57:52.352
TALIESIN: No, I'm an evil green dragon, let me
in.

01:57:52.352 --> 01:57:54.493
LAURA: Are you here for our later talk?

01:57:54.493 --> 01:57:57.560
TALIESIN: No this is a very-- open the door, I
have something to show you.

01:57:57.560 --> 01:58:01.455
LAURA: Fine. I open the door completely naked!

01:58:01.455 --> 01:58:03.304
MARISHA: Ooh!

01:58:03.304 --> 01:58:05.259
LAURA: What was it, dear?

01:58:05.259 --> 01:58:07.164
MARISHA: (laughs) It's a power play, I love it!

01:58:07.164 --> 01:58:12.684
TALIESIN: I don't remember but it was mostly to
head in this direction. Can I come in?

01:58:12.684 --> 01:58:17.785
LAURA: Sure, of course! Would you like to talk
before, or after?

01:58:17.785 --> 01:58:21.355
TALIESIN: I open the bag.

01:58:21.355 --> 01:58:23.820
(laughter)

01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:29.367
TALIESIN: I pull out the first bottle. This is
called Dire Heart. I pull out the second one. This

01:58:29.367 --> 01:58:34.581
we simply call Courage. I pull out the third one.
And this is a snow mead. And this is Green Tear

01:58:34.581 --> 01:58:35.701
Whiskey.

01:58:35.701 --> 01:58:37.233
LIAM: Drink the Courage one now.

01:58:37.233 --> 01:58:42.737
TALIESIN: We're going to start with the Courage
and not talk about dragons. And I run in and shut

01:58:42.737 --> 01:58:49.609
the door. You just stepped on the whole thing,
didn't you?

01:58:49.609 --> 01:58:53.367
(laughter)

01:58:53.367 --> 01:58:54.905
MATT: That was beautiful!

01:58:54.905 --> 01:58:56.686
MARY: I can't wait for the artwork!

01:58:56.686 --> 01:58:58.095
(laughter)

01:58:58.095 --> 01:59:02.734
TALIESIN: I will be expecting labels for all of
them.

01:59:02.734 --> 01:59:05.072
LIAM: You can't always be in control, Percy.

01:59:05.072 --> 01:59:07.150
TALIESIN: No, I can't. It's beautiful.

01:59:07.150 --> 01:59:08.496
MARY: Not when Vex is around.

01:59:08.496 --> 01:59:12.293
MATT: Awesome. While you guys rest, most of you
rest for the evening, we're going to go ahead and

01:59:12.293 --> 01:59:16.052
take a restroom break. We'll be back here in a few
minutes to continue the story. Stick around for

01:59:16.052 --> 01:59:20.447
the break for a wonderful video message from
Patrick Rothfuss about the Worldbuilders charity

01:59:20.447 --> 01:59:24.647
that we're supporting. Information will be coming
up here shortly. See you in a bit!

01:59:24.647 --> 02:18:11.368
[break]

02:18:11.368 --> 02:18:17.476
MATT: And welcome back, everyone, to Critical
Role, as we come back from the break. We will have

02:18:17.476 --> 02:18:24.954
a winner from the chat room giveaway from our
friends at Wyrmwood. We are giving away an awesome

02:18:24.954 --> 02:18:32.596
English Wych Elm Burl Personal Dice Tray winner if
you guys were in chat. It's actually, this is

02:18:32.596 --> 02:18:41.781
really cool. If I pull it out of the box there.
It's got a leather interior, it's awesome. And it

02:18:41.781 --> 02:18:43.814
goes to Jaanro.

02:18:43.814 --> 02:18:49.252
(cheering)

02:18:49.252 --> 02:18:58.189
MATT: So we'll get that to you very soon. Go ahead
and make sure to contact some of the crew here, or

02:18:58.189 --> 02:19:03.989
the mods, and get your information to get this out
to you ASAP, so congratulations. And thank you once

02:19:04.098 --> 02:19:06.618
again, Wyrmwood, for making this possible.

02:19:06.618 --> 02:19:10.244
MARISHA: And by ASAP we mean as soon as we get out
the other 20 packages we need to get out and then

02:19:10.244 --> 02:19:12.964
you're in the queue! Welcome to being in line.

02:19:12.964 --> 02:19:17.968
TALIESIN: It's like the kickstarter you didn't
sign up for. It's coming!

02:19:17.968 --> 02:19:20.180
MARISHA: I didn't want this.

02:19:20.180 --> 02:19:29.688
MATT: All right! So, coming back into our game.
Get my music situated here. [very loud music] Oh

02:19:29.688 --> 02:19:38.168
my, volume! So, as you all slowly come to
consciousnesses the following morning, well-rested

02:19:38.168 --> 02:19:46.868
for the most part. You gather your supplies, you
prepare whatever else you prepared before, making

02:19:46.868 --> 02:19:52.952
your way to the coming battle. So, what do you
guys want to do?

02:19:52.952 --> 02:19:55.086
SAM: Go to the coming battle?

02:19:55.086 --> 02:19:56.124
MARY: Yes.

02:19:56.124 --> 02:19:59.560
MATT: All right, if you have all your things
situated, you wait throughout the day, anxiously,

02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:03.434
eating your meal, looking to--

02:20:03.434 --> 02:20:05.819
LIAM: Why is the music so--

02:20:05.819 --> 02:20:07.697
MATT: The music is intense here.

02:20:07.697 --> 02:20:09.307
LIAM: Is he here now?

02:20:09.307 --> 02:20:14.080
SAM: I attack Zahra!

02:20:14.080 --> 02:20:18.701
MARY: I use Witch Bolt on Scanlan!

02:20:18.701 --> 02:20:21.585
TALIESIN: It's like that random Final Fantasy
encounter just happened and you're like, I only

02:20:21.585 --> 02:20:23.021
got ten feet.

02:20:23.021 --> 02:20:25.495
MARISHA: I just got out of the shop. &lt;i&gt;Just&lt;/i&gt; got
out.

02:20:25.495 --> 02:20:27.360
MARY: And in that moment, we fall in love.

02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:31.180
WILL: If it's the &lt;i&gt;final&lt;/i&gt; fantasy, why are there
14 of them?

02:20:31.180 --> 02:20:33.729
MARISHA: Every J-RPG.

02:20:33.729 --> 02:20:35.585
MATT: We're fixing the audio.

02:20:35.585 --> 02:20:39.036
(loud wind instruments)

02:20:39.036 --> 02:20:40.961
MATT: I don't think this is mine, either.

02:20:40.961 --> 02:20:44.005
SAM: Is this just a radio station that we're
picking up?

02:20:44.005 --> 02:20:47.354
WILL: You're listening to the sounds of
Whitestone.

02:20:47.354 --> 02:20:51.025
MARY: On WNBC radio!

02:20:51.025 --> 02:20:57.935
WILL: This is dragon radio. Giving a shout-out to
the Conclave, Vox Machina...

02:20:57.935 --> 02:21:05.265
MATT: Okay. I think we're at my tracks. Okay.
Thank you for your patience. I need my music. It's

02:21:05.265 --> 02:21:10.565
just a thing; I need to have it there. I can't
focus and dungeon master if I forget the music.

02:21:10.565 --> 02:21:19.708
What? So, thank you, guys. Pushing through the
day, working through the antsiness of the coming

02:21:19.708 --> 02:21:30.381
conflict. Allura, communicating back and forth,
gets word that the forces have gathered,

02:21:30.381 --> 02:21:37.821
temporarily set up camp to arm themselves and
prepare for the battle once sundown hits.

02:21:37.821 --> 02:21:41.158
Warmaster Mikael Daxio is awaiting your arrival.

02:21:41.158 --> 02:21:51.963
LAURA: I have a question. I have a question. I'm
going to attune the Boots of Haste that I took

02:21:51.963 --> 02:21:53.601
from my brother just now.

02:21:53.601 --> 02:21:55.740
LIAM: That your brother gave to you.

02:21:55.740 --> 02:22:03.878
LAURA: That my brother gave to me. And if I
un-attune my Coldsnap Armor, do I just lose the

02:22:03.878 --> 02:22:05.272
cold resistance?

02:22:05.272 --> 02:22:09.907
MATT: And any sort of armor bonus that it gave
you. I mean, you would still have the armor. Like,

02:22:09.907 --> 02:22:15.817
if it's leather armor, it would give you a bonus
of two to your AC. But if it's a plus two armor,

02:22:15.817 --> 02:22:18.904
you would lose the plus two on top of the actual
armor.

02:22:18.904 --> 02:22:25.858
LAURA: That's a big drop. I'm going to take my
bracers off, then.

02:22:25.858 --> 02:22:27.818
MATT: Okay, so you're doing two less damage per
attack.

02:22:27.818 --> 02:22:29.051
LAURA: Yes.

02:22:29.051 --> 02:22:30.281
MATT: Okay.

02:22:30.281 --> 02:22:32.414
LIAM: That's smarter. That's wise.

02:22:32.414 --> 02:22:34.486
MARY: I'm going to attune my Charred Dark Staff.

02:22:34.486 --> 02:22:36.231
MATT: All right. Good.

02:22:36.231 --> 02:22:44.120
MARISHA: And I'm going to go ahead and attune to
my cape, instead of my ring.

02:22:44.120 --> 02:22:47.667
MATT: Okay.

02:22:47.667 --> 02:22:52.850
LIAM: I'm attuning the dragon sword, and I want to
use it a little bit just so I don't get pantsed in

02:22:52.850 --> 02:22:57.089
the moment. Does it work all right; am I all right
with this? It's awfully large.

02:22:57.089 --> 02:22:59.197
MATT: It's bigger than what you're used to.

02:22:59.197 --> 02:23:00.443
LIAM: Yeah.

02:23:00.443 --> 02:23:02.524
WILL: Do you want to spar?

02:23:02.524 --> 02:23:04.156
MATT: But even still--

02:23:04.156 --> 02:23:07.908
TALIESIN: It won't do a bonus to him. He's not a
dragon.

02:23:07.908 --> 02:23:09.528
LIAM: I mean, I'd like to, but do we have time?

02:23:09.528 --> 02:23:11.974
MATT: You could give it a shot.

02:23:11.974 --> 02:23:13.258
LIAM: Yeah, sure.

02:23:13.258 --> 02:23:18.299
MATT: All right, so the two of you square off
briefly out in the streets just outside of the

02:23:18.299 --> 02:23:20.615
guard barracks.

02:23:20.615 --> 02:23:22.395
LAURA: I whisper in my brother's ear.

02:23:22.395 --> 02:23:23.794
LIAM: What?

02:23:23.794 --> 02:23:29.920
LAURA: Just be careful because-- What? What?

02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:31.668
LIAM: Nothing. What were you going to say?

02:23:31.668 --> 02:23:33.761
LAURA: Be careful; I think he has a grudge against
you.

02:23:33.761 --> 02:23:35.120
LIAM: For what?

02:23:35.120 --> 02:23:37.433
LAURA: Just go. You'll be great.

02:23:37.433 --> 02:23:39.314
WILL: Am I fighting you or your sister?

02:23:39.314 --> 02:23:42.134
LIAM: It's really the same thing, at all times.

02:23:42.134 --> 02:23:44.878
MARY: I use Awakened Mind and I say, Kash, go easy
on him.

02:23:44.878 --> 02:23:47.314
LAURA: (laughs) Oh, shit.

02:23:47.314 --> 02:23:53.698
WILL: We're going easy. I just want to make sure
that you and your blade are one before you go into

02:23:53.698 --> 02:23:56.123
battle. It's a bad time to find out you don't know
how to use it.

02:23:56.123 --> 02:23:58.222
LIAM: I poke him in the knee with my sword.

02:23:58.222 --> 02:23:59.854
(laughter)

02:23:59.854 --> 02:24:01.414
MATT: Roll an attack.

02:24:01.414 --> 02:24:05.116
LIAM: That is-- Is this a sneak attack?

02:24:05.116 --> 02:24:06.428
MATT: No.

02:24:06.428 --> 02:24:08.215
LIAM: No, it's just 28.

02:24:08.215 --> 02:24:13.225
MATT: All right, so yeah. So, as you say that, he
smiles, and before you even notice, you hear a

02:24:13.225 --> 02:24:16.187
ping! and you feel a slight vibration into your
lower pauldron, and you look down and the sword

02:24:16.187 --> 02:24:20.883
has not hurt you, but it has definitely pierced
the plates behind the armor and he's showing, he's

02:24:20.883 --> 02:24:25.523
posturing that he already has availability with
the blade between your armor.

02:24:25.523 --> 02:24:27.686
WILL: Interesting.

02:24:27.686 --> 02:24:29.860
LIAM: I jump back five feet.

02:24:29.860 --> 02:24:32.432
(laughter)

02:24:32.432 --> 02:24:34.597
WILL: I Flame Strike! No, I'm kidding.

02:24:34.597 --> 02:24:36.859
(laughter)

02:24:36.859 --> 02:24:38.282
LIAM: Evasion!

02:24:38.282 --> 02:24:40.036
WILL: Just jump right to it.

02:24:40.036 --> 02:24:46.556
MATT: "Where's Vox Machina?" "Well, um. They
killed each other. It's weird."

02:24:46.556 --> 02:24:48.472
(laughter)

02:24:48.472 --> 02:24:53.792
So as you both stand there, in a moment, squaring
off, the tension still in the city from the coming

02:24:53.792 --> 02:24:57.273
event, but people are starting to look out and
gather. They're having a "Morpheus is fighting

02:24:57.273 --> 02:25:01.074
Neo" moment as people are starting to pull others
from nearby buildings, and gather in a small

02:25:01.074 --> 02:25:02.567
circle around.

02:25:02.567 --> 02:25:07.327
MARISHA: Yeah, I go up to Vex, and go: why-- Why
is this happening? Is this happening for, like,

02:25:07.327 --> 02:25:09.308
a-- Did they tell you-- Did they tell you the
reason?

02:25:09.308 --> 02:25:11.455
LAURA: They're fighting over you, darling. They're
fighting over you.

02:25:11.455 --> 02:25:15.710
MARISHA: I can tell-- I've been with you for a
long time. I can tell when you're lying to me.

02:25:15.710 --> 02:25:17.348
LAURA: They both professed their love and now
they're fighting.

02:25:17.348 --> 02:25:18.972
MARISHA: Now you're patronizing me.

02:25:18.972 --> 02:25:23.008
LIAM: (calls) We're really not that far away! Are
we going to do this? You ready?

02:25:23.008 --> 02:25:24.400
WILL: I'm ready when you are.

02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:25.635
MATT: Who's making the first move?

02:25:25.635 --> 02:25:29.993
LIAM: Me. Are we doing initiative or attacks? I
don't even know what this is?

02:25:29.993 --> 02:25:34.354
MATT: The initiative was whoever said "me" first,
so.

02:25:34.354 --> 02:25:38.808
MARISHA: I didn't know how badly I wanted this
until now.

02:25:38.808 --> 02:25:40.846
TALIESIN: Boy, I did.

02:25:40.846 --> 02:25:47.696
LIAM: Oh, man, what are we fighting to? Here we
go. So that is the first and that is-- I'm going

02:25:47.696 --> 02:25:49.310
to use Luck.

02:25:49.310 --> 02:25:53.038
MARISHA: You're about to fight a fucking dragon!
You're fighting Kash!

02:25:53.038 --> 02:25:57.329
MATT: You do realize-- You only have-- You're
spending your Luck for--

02:25:57.329 --> 02:26:02.655
LIAM: I spent it already. Just so we're clear,
everybody-- I'm going to switch back to Liam--

02:26:02.655 --> 02:26:09.870
This is a game! This is a game. Which camera's on
me? &lt;i&gt;This is a game&lt;/i&gt;!

02:26:09.870 --> 02:26:12.141
WILL: Your fun is wrong.

02:26:12.141 --> 02:26:13.622
MARY: Your fun is very wrong.

02:26:13.622 --> 02:26:15.180
LIAM: So it's an 18.

02:26:15.180 --> 02:26:16.972
MATT: An 18. What's your armor class? With your
shield?

02:26:16.972 --> 02:26:18.580
WILL: My armor class is 20.

02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:20.465
MATT: As you go to strike with the sword--

02:26:20.465 --> 02:26:21.573
LIAM: That's the first one.

02:26:21.573 --> 02:26:24.481
MATT: Yes. With your sword. And so now you're
attacking with your--?

02:26:24.481 --> 02:26:27.522
LIAM: Natural 20, with Whisper.

02:26:27.522 --> 02:26:33.384
MATT: With Whisper, okay. All right. So, as he
swings with the sword, with your shield you

02:26:33.384 --> 02:26:37.197
deflect it off to the side and you're about to
bring your spear through for your own strike.

02:26:37.197 --> 02:26:42.346
However, he's suddenly much closer than you
expected, and you feel the blade shirk the side of

02:26:42.346 --> 02:26:46.416
the armor. So for the purposes of this, we're not
rolling damage because it's to spar--

02:26:46.416 --> 02:26:47.618
LIAM: Thank you.

02:26:47.618 --> 02:26:53.499
MATT: But the blade hits and pokes just enough
where you know that's maybe-- That's where the

02:26:53.499 --> 02:26:54.629
kidney is.

02:26:54.629 --> 02:26:56.067
WILL: Right, okay.

02:26:56.067 --> 02:26:59.250
MATT: And in that brief moment, you see the little
creeping smile up the side of his mouth. You go

02:26:59.250 --> 02:27:01.665
ahead and roll your attack now, Kashaw.

02:27:01.665 --> 02:27:03.099
WILL: 18.

02:27:03.099 --> 02:27:04.508
MATT: Plus?

02:27:04.508 --> 02:27:09.503
WILL: Plus, well, if I'm using my-- I don't want
to use the shadow spear. Should we use-- Let's not

02:27:09.503 --> 02:27:15.055
do nec damage on him, let's think. It's just a
regular plus two, right?

02:27:15.055 --> 02:27:16.971
LIAM: So what is he at?

02:27:16.971 --> 02:27:18.250
MATT: 20.

02:27:18.250 --> 02:27:19.724
LIAM: Nope.

02:27:19.724 --> 02:27:22.306
MATT: Well, it's a plus two spear. What's your
attack bonus altogether?

02:27:22.306 --> 02:27:24.476
WILL: Oh, with the attack bonus is plus ten.

02:27:24.476 --> 02:27:26.371
MATT: So that's 28.

02:27:26.371 --> 02:27:27.940
WILL: 28 to you, yeah.

02:27:27.940 --> 02:27:29.369
LIAM: Oh, that definitely hits.

02:27:29.369 --> 02:27:32.950
MATT: Yeah, so, after you get the blade there,
there's that moment of posturing. How do you

02:27:32.950 --> 02:27:34.429
deflect him off?

02:27:34.429 --> 02:27:39.847
WILL: I think, yeah, the blade comes in, he's got
his spear, so as the blade comes in, he slaps his

02:27:39.847 --> 02:27:46.952
arm away and just takes it right lightly across
the chest so it just cuts into the little bit of fat.

02:27:46.952 --> 02:27:51.849
MATT: Just-- (slicing noise). You back away and
you see two of the mantle-like dark feathers of

02:27:51.849 --> 02:27:54.560
your armor, the very tips just go-- (puff)

02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:56.943
WILL: And then I look at you and go: one-one.

02:27:56.943 --> 02:27:59.139
(laughter)

02:27:59.139 --> 02:28:02.961
MARY: I cast Eldritch Blast, two beams, right in
front of either one of them.

02:28:02.961 --> 02:28:09.080
MATT: As you guys are having this moment, all of a
sudden the ground detonates before you. In a haze

02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:16.562
of greenish-white arcane energy, you see now these
small basketball-sized concave blast craters in

02:28:16.562 --> 02:28:20.599
the ground before each of you, and right off to
the side you see Zahra standing, staff in one

02:28:20.599 --> 02:28:23.813
hand, hand before her with the other.

02:28:23.813 --> 02:28:27.104
LIAM: Oh, you do have two different color eyes.
They're so nice.

02:28:27.104 --> 02:28:29.969
MARY: I use Thaumaturgy to go fire with my eyes.

02:28:29.969 --> 02:28:31.709
WILL: We're just playing.

02:28:31.709 --> 02:28:35.024
MARY: All right, boys. Enough. I appreciate it.

02:28:35.024 --> 02:28:37.480
LIAM: All right, we'll play slap and tickle
later.

02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:43.267
MARY: Your fun is wrong. Play slap-tickle later.
Let's do this.

02:28:43.267 --> 02:28:47.240
LIAM: Anyway, sword works. Sure.

02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:56.159
MATT: All right, you sheath the sword. So you guys
gather the rest of your materials together.

02:28:56.159 --> 02:29:06.211
TALIESIN: We still have that spare sword that was
just that standard rapier that was just in the bag

02:29:06.211 --> 02:29:08.776
before from the general, correct?

02:29:08.776 --> 02:29:11.864
LAURA: Grog has the Bag of Holding, and I don't
know what's in it.

02:29:11.864 --> 02:29:16.862
TALIESIN: I think we have it. We still have just a
very standard nothing, where it's barely a plus one--

02:29:16.862 --> 02:29:19.494
MATT: Yeah, it's barely enchanted.

02:29:19.494 --> 02:29:20.841
LIAM: What'd you need it for?

02:29:20.841 --> 02:29:23.826
TALIESIN: Just in case someone gets close enough
to me that it's complicated.

02:29:23.826 --> 02:29:25.619
LIAM: I have a shortsword, but that sounds
better.

02:29:25.619 --> 02:29:29.011
TALIESIN: It's probably better. It's whatever
Stonefell had.

02:29:29.011 --> 02:29:33.595
MATT: Shortsword is dex-based, so you're going to
probably want to run with that.

02:29:33.595 --> 02:29:40.903
MARISHA: I need to roll really fast to recharge my
Spire. So I'm going to do that, real fast.

02:29:40.903 --> 02:29:43.922
MATT: All right. And actually, you should roll to
recharge your wand.

02:29:43.922 --> 02:29:45.789
MARISHA: It goes all the way up. It is full
again.

02:29:45.789 --> 02:29:47.266
MATT: All right.

02:29:47.266 --> 02:29:52.436
MARISHA: I rolled four plus four.

02:29:52.436 --> 02:29:55.309
MATT: Twice, actually, for two nights of rest,
so.

02:29:55.309 --> 02:29:56.673
WILL: "My spire's full."

02:29:56.673 --> 02:29:58.129
MARY: "So is mine."

02:29:58.129 --> 02:30:00.449
SAM: Seven. So I'm back up to normal.

02:30:00.449 --> 02:30:11.135
MATT: Okay. All righty. As you guys are preparing,
Gilmore comes out. He's usually dressed in his

02:30:11.135 --> 02:30:20.565
usual casual flowing robes. Or his wizard
tracksuit-type outfit. The outfit you see on him,

02:30:20.565 --> 02:30:27.541
it's more ornamental. And it's, specifically more
so than you've seen him wear, it has a very

02:30:27.541 --> 02:30:35.557
similar design and presentation of some of the
more noble individuals you saw wandering Marquet,

02:30:35.557 --> 02:30:42.296
Ank'Harel in particular. He seems to be going more
ceremonial than you're used to seeing Gilmore.

02:30:42.296 --> 02:30:44.341
LAURA: What color are the robes?

02:30:44.341 --> 02:30:50.073
MATT: Oh, they are very much purple and gold. He
keeps to his aesthetic. But the design is

02:30:50.073 --> 02:30:52.885
definitely ceremonial; different than anything
you've seen him wear.

02:30:52.885 --> 02:30:54.163
MARISHA: Wow.

02:30:54.163 --> 02:30:55.784
LIAM: Full Bollywood.

02:30:55.784 --> 02:30:57.988
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I was thinking about!

02:30:57.988 --> 02:31:00.881
SAM: Is it his old boy scout uniform or what?

02:31:00.881 --> 02:31:06.754
MATT: It's a long mantle that travels down to the
lower part of his torso, where his arms come out

02:31:06.754 --> 02:31:12.411
from these long sleeves that come to a fine point
at the ends. He still has all of his jewelry on,

02:31:12.411 --> 02:31:15.933
but where the belt is you can see it's a very
thick, heavy belt that like ties to a bow in the

02:31:15.933 --> 02:31:22.941
center, almost like a reverse kimono that comes to
a square point. And the robe itself drops low and

02:31:22.941 --> 02:31:30.356
flows behind him as he walks. It's really pretty.
As he walks in, he's holding himself with the

02:31:30.356 --> 02:31:36.789
Gilmore air, but you can still see a bead of sweat
down his head and a little bit of nervous energy.

02:31:36.789 --> 02:31:40.095
"Very well, I guess today's the day."

02:31:40.095 --> 02:31:42.290
TALIESIN: Be pleased.

02:31:42.290 --> 02:31:43.761
SAM: How are we going to get there?

02:31:43.761 --> 02:31:45.808
MATT: "Be pleased."

02:31:45.808 --> 02:31:47.668
WILL: Are we speaking to the general first?

02:31:47.668 --> 02:31:53.595
SAM: Yeah, we're going there first. But not via a
tree, we have to go via something else.

02:31:53.595 --> 02:31:55.423
LAURA: Why not via a tree?

02:31:55.423 --> 02:31:57.231
SAM: Is there a tree on the battlefield where they
are?

02:31:57.231 --> 02:31:58.901
LAURA: Well, it's not a battlefield.

02:31:58.901 --> 02:32:05.546
MARISHA: I will be able to find out when we scry.
If not, we'll have to talk to Allura. I'm going to

02:32:05.546 --> 02:32:09.113
scry real quick! Scrying Eye.

02:32:09.113 --> 02:32:10.370
MATT: Who are you scrying on?

02:32:10.370 --> 02:32:16.067
MARISHA: Can't hide from my scrying eyes. Your
dad. What's his name? Syldor, okay.

02:32:16.067 --> 02:32:21.360
TALIESIN: Syldor the inevitably disappointed.
That's his full title.

02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:38.297
MATT: Okay, you scry Syldor. You have a bit of a
flash of green, lots of green, endless green. Your

02:32:38.297 --> 02:32:50.078
vision jumps into a familiar warm home. You see
Syldor nervously sitting with his daughter on his

02:32:50.078 --> 02:32:58.581
knee, and they're talking. Syldor is back in
Syngorn. Syldor isn't a fighter, Syldor is a

02:32:58.581 --> 02:32:59.828
diplomat.

02:32:59.828 --> 02:33:01.434
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fair.

02:33:01.434 --> 02:33:04.412
LAURA: Right, right.

02:33:04.412 --> 02:33:06.260
WILL: Did you see them? Where are they?

02:33:06.260 --> 02:33:11.162
MARISHA: Happy and healthy and comfortable by a
fire.

02:33:11.162 --> 02:33:13.750
WILL: The whole army is happy and healthy and
comfortable by a fire?!

02:33:13.750 --> 02:33:19.372
MARISHA: No, he's not with the army is what I
mean. Oh shit. I thought he was going to be with

02:33:19.372 --> 02:33:20.637
the army.

02:33:20.637 --> 02:33:22.751
TALIESIN: It's okay we have plan B. Let's go deal
with plan B.

02:33:22.751 --> 02:33:24.849
MARISHA: Okay, I'll scry again.

02:33:24.849 --> 02:33:28.175
TALIESIN: Or we can make Allura do it.

02:33:28.175 --> 02:33:32.957
MARISHA: Allura, do you know where they are?

02:33:32.957 --> 02:33:35.208
LAURA: She can take us to Daxio?

02:33:35.208 --> 02:33:47.564
MATT: "I don't know specifically where they are."
And she sits for a second and sets up a rush job

02:33:47.564 --> 02:33:50.949
of a scry ritual, 'cause now she feels she's been
put on the spot. But she puts it together.

02:33:50.949 --> 02:33:52.698
MARISHA: Can I help her a little bit?

02:33:52.698 --> 02:33:56.088
MATT: Yeah, you give her a little aid. You pay it
back to the last time you helped her with a scry

02:33:56.088 --> 02:34:03.258
spell, back when you first met in Emon. And her
eyes blink over white again, cloudy. And she

02:34:03.258 --> 02:34:15.461
returns. "All right, I see Mikael and the army
gathered, and there is a very energetic air to

02:34:15.461 --> 02:34:19.845
"them. They're looking restless. I can bring eight
of you with me."

02:34:19.845 --> 02:34:26.577
SAM: Well, are there any trees near them?

02:34:26.577 --> 02:34:28.336
MATT: "There are, yeah."

02:34:28.336 --> 02:34:34.747
MARISHA: The problem is it generally has to be a
tree that I'm familiar with.

02:34:34.747 --> 02:34:38.656
SAM: If you go with her, you'll be familiar with
the tree.

02:34:38.656 --> 02:34:41.538
MARISHA: It doesn't work that way.

02:34:41.538 --> 02:34:47.406
LAURA: Question, if you go and you open up a path
to the Sun Tree, can people on this side run

02:34:47.406 --> 02:34:49.245
through the Sun Tree?

02:34:49.245 --> 02:34:52.529
MARISHA: Can I? That's an excellent question, can
I?

02:34:52.529 --> 02:34:57.052
MATT: Wait, so if you Transport via Plants--

02:34:57.052 --> 02:35:01.293
MARISHA: Like if I go with Allura and then open a
gate through the Sun Tree, and they're just ready

02:35:01.293 --> 02:35:02.656
to rock.

02:35:02.656 --> 02:35:05.043
TALIESIN: Do you have a Sling Ring?

02:35:05.043 --> 02:35:07.758
MARISHA: Oh, damn it. Fucking lost my Sling Ring.

02:35:07.758 --> 02:35:09.566
MATT: It does; it connects the plants on both
sides.

02:35:09.566 --> 02:35:11.334
(cheering)

02:35:11.334 --> 02:35:15.672
MARISHA: Hey! I'll do that. Does anyone else want
to go, just in case?

02:35:15.672 --> 02:35:19.846
LAURA: Yeah, the eight of us need to go. And then
how many is that left?

02:35:19.846 --> 02:35:22.293
MATT: "That would leave--"

02:35:22.293 --> 02:35:24.558
SAM: Four?

02:35:24.558 --> 02:35:32.719
MATT: "Then Grog, Pike and Gilmore. And Kima. And
Jarett. Yeah, we could bring everybody."

02:35:32.719 --> 02:35:33.918
LAURA: And Drake?

02:35:33.918 --> 02:35:38.815
MATT: "Is Drake coming?" And she looks off to the
side, and you see this little figure running down

02:35:38.815 --> 02:35:45.110
from the castle at the top, carrying all this shit
in his arms. "Hold on! I'm--" And you watch him

02:35:45.110 --> 02:35:53.633
just eat shit. He just tumbles; scatters. Gets up
and is like, "No one saw that!" Picks it back up,

02:35:53.633 --> 02:35:56.104
runs back down and catches up.

02:35:56.104 --> 02:36:02.977
TALIESIN: Are we supposed to get something from
the-- Oh god, we were supposed to-- Weren't we

02:36:02.977 --> 02:36:05.427
supposed to grab something earlier? My brain is
just turning to mush.

02:36:05.427 --> 02:36:06.475
SAM: We got it already.

02:36:06.475 --> 02:36:07.817
TALIESIN: Oh, we got it already; never mind,
that's right.

02:36:07.817 --> 02:36:09.385
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He gave it to us.

02:36:09.385 --> 02:36:12.473
MARISHA: Where's Raishan, though?

02:36:12.473 --> 02:36:14.896
LIAM: Yeah. Are we going to talk to
what's-her-butt?

02:36:14.896 --> 02:36:20.328
SAM: She'll find us. She's not our problem. She's
not our problem. We're not babysitting a dragon.

02:36:20.328 --> 02:36:23.387
TALIESIN: In fact, if anything, the less we speak
to her at this point, probably the better.

02:36:23.387 --> 02:36:25.309
WILL: And you're sure she's coming?

02:36:25.309 --> 02:36:30.190
MATT: "Don't worry; she's coming." And you hear
another dwarven voice from the side, as you glance

02:36:30.190 --> 02:36:34.189
out you see there's standing not too far from you,
arms crossed, Larkin.

02:36:34.189 --> 02:36:36.957
(cheering)

02:36:36.957 --> 02:36:41.555
LIAM: Buddy! Where have you been!? I've been
fucking worried sick! You were there; you were

02:36:41.555 --> 02:36:43.134
gone. How'd you even get back here?

02:36:43.134 --> 02:36:44.725
MARISHA: Vax, please, don't--

02:36:44.725 --> 02:36:53.485
LIAM: Listen, I'm fucking with you. All right?
What's up, green bean?

02:36:53.485 --> 02:36:58.336
MATT: "So, are we ready for this?"

02:36:58.336 --> 02:36:59.830
TALIESIN: No.

02:36:59.830 --> 02:37:02.613
MATT: "Didn't think so. Let's do it."

02:37:02.613 --> 02:37:08.778
SAM: So you all go; I'll stay with these ragtag
group and sit by the tree and get ready.

02:37:08.778 --> 02:37:10.393
LAURA and MARISHA: All right.

02:37:10.393 --> 02:37:17.369
MATT: Allura grabs you, and takes Kima, and the
rest of the group that she can, and over time you

02:37:17.369 --> 02:37:22.039
guys manage to get-- we'll say for the sake of
brevity here-- everyone back over to the war camp

02:37:22.039 --> 02:37:26.856
itself. And it is a fair-sized war camp. And
what's interesting is as you're within this camp,

02:37:26.856 --> 02:37:32.341
you look up, and in a similar way, the illusion
barrier that surrounds Whitestone, that very, very

02:37:32.341 --> 02:37:41.588
faint shimmering effect, is present, but it's much
stronger and it's much more visceral in the way

02:37:41.588 --> 02:37:45.005
that it alters the visuals. It looks like the sky
is this perpetual shifting kaleidoscope of colors.

02:37:45.005 --> 02:37:49.635
The blue sky becomes green, becomes purple,
becomes red; it just constantly shifts like the

02:37:49.635 --> 02:37:52.722
surface of a pond that's been perpetually
rippling.

02:37:52.722 --> 02:37:59.280
And you see on the outskirts of the war camp, this
rotating guard of illusionists that are taking

02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:06.548
time to just restore and maintain this illusion,
as everyone else is eating, polishing their

02:38:06.548 --> 02:38:17.772
weapons and armor. You see a mix of elven
warriors, elven archers, and, very similar to the

02:38:17.772 --> 02:38:22.429
Daxio soldiers you met earlier, but armor of
different crests, signifying the different

02:38:22.429 --> 02:38:23.875
regiments.

02:38:23.875 --> 02:38:30.877
It doesn't take you too long to eventually come
upon, and be led to, the tent where Mikael is, the

02:38:30.877 --> 02:38:35.813
Warmaster himself. The Warmaster, I do not believe
you've met before, personally.

02:38:35.813 --> 02:38:43.879
As you enter and look within, you can see the
Warmaster-- It sets you off at first, because he

02:38:43.879 --> 02:38:51.851
does resemble his son. His son, who you did not
have quite a positive experience with. He's an

02:38:51.851 --> 02:38:57.881
older elvish man. His hair just past
shoulder-length, but pulled into a very, very

02:38:57.881 --> 02:39:05.777
tight ponytail in the back, with a few strands
that fall in front of his face. He has a very,

02:39:05.777 --> 02:39:14.266
very strong jaw for an elf. He's a thick and
well-built warrior and holds that with both a

02:39:14.266 --> 02:39:20.281
strength, and commanding respect, and everyone
around him definitely looks up to him. You can

02:39:20.281 --> 02:39:24.937
immediately see why he's the Warmaster and how
he's held that position for so long. And you also

02:39:24.937 --> 02:39:30.291
wonder, one, how his son fell so hard, and two,
how it must have affected him.

02:39:30.291 --> 02:39:35.561
But in that instant as you enter, he's in the
process of having a conversation, and they have a

02:39:35.561 --> 02:39:42.433
layout of what looks to be a brief sketch of Emon
in its current state, with a few things here and

02:39:42.433 --> 02:39:50.361
there marking where most of the gathered elements
of the army, whatever you'd call it, the defense

02:39:50.361 --> 02:39:59.342
of Emon, exists. And as you all begin to enter the
tent, he goes, "Oh, hello. I know of you, and I've

02:39:59.342 --> 02:40:10.578
"been expecting you. Allura has been kind enough to
fill me in, in bits and pieces, but as far as I am

02:40:10.578 --> 02:40:14.379
"to understand, you're our strike force?"

02:40:14.379 --> 02:40:18.199
LAURA: The elite SWAT team, heading in there.

02:40:18.199 --> 02:40:24.233
MATT: "Good to know this. We've been walking for
quite some time, and the soldiers have had a bit

02:40:24.233 --> 02:40:30.941
"of rest. If we could, we would take an additional
day, just to put it at our most capable, but it

02:40:30.941 --> 02:40:39.985
"seems time is not at our beck and call in this
situation, and as such, when the sun is down, I

02:40:39.985 --> 02:40:43.445
"think that is the agreed-upon time to strike."

02:40:43.445 --> 02:40:47.385
SAM: At sundown. All right, sure. Yeah, yeah,
sure.

02:40:47.385 --> 02:40:51.761
TALIESIN: Most of these soldiers have, at least,
night vision, some form of darkvision, I assume.

02:40:51.761 --> 02:40:57.920
MATT: "Most of the Syngorian army does, and we
have quite a few at Daxio that do as well."

02:40:57.920 --> 02:41:00.598
WILL: (flatly) How are you going to attack?

02:41:00.598 --> 02:41:04.543
LAURA: This is Kashaw.

02:41:04.543 --> 02:41:06.613
WILL: Hi. How are you going to attack?

02:41:06.613 --> 02:41:15.152
MATT: "Pleasure to meet you as well. So. We have
broken up the regiments into five different

02:41:15.152 --> 02:41:19.984
"segments. We're going to separate, leading into
the initial strike. We're going to simultaneously

02:41:19.984 --> 02:41:26.004
"hit the four main gates, the north, south, east,
and west side. The easternmost gate has already

02:41:26.004 --> 02:41:30.396
"received quite a bit of damage. With all the
simultaneous strikes, we're hoping to draw most of

02:41:30.396 --> 02:41:35.338
"the army to the outer circles of the city. We're
going to utilize this time to then shift our

02:41:35.338 --> 02:41:39.874
"forces southward and instead push towards a
singular gate in a southward position, while

02:41:39.874 --> 02:41:45.637
"they're scattered in that direction. If I'm to
understand what Allura has told me, you are going

02:41:45.637 --> 02:41:48.532
"to be entering from underneath the city?"

02:41:48.532 --> 02:41:50.089
TALIESIN: That is the plan.

02:41:50.089 --> 02:41:56.180
MATT: "And attempting to facilitate the opening of
one or more of these gates in doing so?"

02:41:56.180 --> 02:41:58.742
LAURA: That would be swell if we can, huh?

02:41:58.742 --> 02:42:00.234
MATT: "That would be."

02:42:00.234 --> 02:42:02.590
TALIESIN: We haven't really discussed it, but--

02:42:02.590 --> 02:42:04.494
LAURA: No, no, no, but we have talked about doing
it.

02:42:04.494 --> 02:42:09.483
TALIESIN: Or even breaching the south gate alone
would be-- If all four gates are being--

02:42:09.483 --> 02:42:13.213
WILL: Any time we go out and we attack a gate,
they're going to bring all of their forces to that

02:42:13.213 --> 02:42:18.515
gate. What they're not going to be suspecting is a
wall being ripped down. And once you open a wall,

02:42:18.515 --> 02:42:20.353
you can't close it. You can close a gate.

02:42:20.353 --> 02:42:22.805
LAURA: What's the weakest wall?

02:42:22.805 --> 02:42:24.817
MATT: "That would be the eastern wall."

02:42:24.817 --> 02:42:26.206
TALIESIN: It's also near Greyskull Keep.

02:42:26.206 --> 02:42:28.506
MARY: Oh, that's the arrow that you're going to
use, yes.

02:42:28.506 --> 02:42:35.866
MATT: "While we are not in a position to use siege
weaponry, we do have most of our mages at our

02:42:35.866 --> 02:42:44.975
"disposal, and they have prepared a modicum of
siege-based arcane spells at their disposal. So I

02:42:44.975 --> 02:42:50.758
"do not think piercing the outer wall will be an
issue. It's what lies beyond it that our focus is

02:42:50.758 --> 02:42:57.254
"going to be: sow confusion, separate and destroy.
They are not a very well-organized army, and most

02:42:57.254 --> 02:43:02.384
"of the creatures we've seen wandering the skies do
so with nothing but bloodlust and the intent to

02:43:02.384 --> 02:43:11.790
"rend and tear as their main driving force and
goal. So, utilizing that technique-- And we've

02:43:11.790 --> 02:43:16.238
"discussed, you'll be entering the walls; we'll be
pushing forward, phalanx method with those that

02:43:16.238 --> 02:43:21.180
"are shielded. We will be piercing through and
scattering from the inside, breaking their ranks

02:43:21.180 --> 02:43:26.550
"as much as possible, and doing our best to stay
out of the skies, using alleyways, using small

02:43:26.550 --> 02:43:31.476
"streets. We don't want our men being plucked out
from the middle, from their air support."

02:43:31.476 --> 02:43:33.536
LAURA: We will have air support.

02:43:33.536 --> 02:43:39.823
MARISHA: I called in assistance from the Air
Ashari, from the north. They're maintaining the skies.

02:43:39.823 --> 02:43:42.071
MATT: "The Ashari are aiding us as well?"

02:43:42.071 --> 02:43:43.578
WILL: Do you know how many?

02:43:43.578 --> 02:43:45.690
MARISHA: Did dad tell me how many?

02:43:45.690 --> 02:43:47.171
MATT: He said roughly a hundred.

02:43:47.171 --> 02:43:50.918
MARISHA: Oh, shit. Thanks, dad. Roughly a
hundred.

02:43:50.918 --> 02:43:58.235
WILL: If I can make a suggestion? If you get into
the city, don't move through the alleys. You're

02:43:58.235 --> 02:44:02.988
going to scatter your forces. Move into the city
and fortify a position. So then you've opened a

02:44:02.988 --> 02:44:07.446
gate inside the city. Move the command center
inside the city, and defend from there.

02:44:07.446 --> 02:44:17.258
MATT: "That is indeed part of our push, however,
we are rather vulnerable from the air. So with the

02:44:17.258 --> 02:44:21.545
"Air Ashari giving us air support, that will allow
us the ability that we need to push forward as a

02:44:21.545 --> 02:44:29.018
"singular unit, from unit to unit, in its own
right. You are entering from where?"

02:44:29.018 --> 02:44:31.348
SAM: The sewers.

02:44:31.348 --> 02:44:39.031
LAURA: Yes. We have a secret entrance in our keep,
if we can still access it. If not, there is an

02:44:39.031 --> 02:44:49.056
entrance to the sewers towards the water. We were
told of it by the Clasp, right?

02:44:49.056 --> 02:44:52.365
SAM: I've also used a tunnel to get out, at some
point.

02:44:52.365 --> 02:44:54.521
MARISHA: That's right, when you were looking for
Kaylie.

02:44:54.521 --> 02:44:56.036
MATT: That was Westruun.

02:44:56.036 --> 02:44:58.292
SAM: It's the same sewer system, though, right?

02:44:58.292 --> 02:45:01.908
MARY: It's the same basic layout of a city, yeah,
right?

02:45:01.908 --> 02:45:06.040
LAURA: Wait, wait, the Traverse Junction. What's
the Traverse Junction?

02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:16.594
MATT: "The Traverse Junction is-- was-- is, as far
as I know, still attached to the Lyceum, but--"

02:45:16.594 --> 02:45:18.596
SAM: The Lyceum's unguarded!

02:45:18.596 --> 02:45:22.552
MATT: "The Lyceum is partially destroyed, and is
filled with the remains of the enemy."

02:45:22.552 --> 02:45:24.243
SAM: I remember that.

02:45:24.243 --> 02:45:29.203
LAURA: That's not what I meant, then. That wasn't
the thing that I meant to say.

02:45:29.203 --> 02:45:33.771
MARISHA: And we know Thordak has made an
underground basin. He only emerges when someone

02:45:33.771 --> 02:45:35.847
challenges him, or offers their loyalty.

02:45:35.847 --> 02:45:38.323
MARY: Were we supposed to meet the Clasp in a
specific place?

02:45:38.323 --> 02:45:40.599
SAM: We've just got to get to a sewer.

02:45:40.599 --> 02:45:45.492
MARY: So we just need to find a sewer and then
we're going to reconnoiter with-- Is that the

02:45:45.492 --> 02:45:49.539
right word? Anyway-- with the Clasp. And at that
point, we shall make our way through--

02:45:49.539 --> 02:45:51.022
MATT: All right.

02:45:51.022 --> 02:45:53.561
WILL: And that's when the thieves and liars will
take us to the thing that's going to kill us all?

02:45:53.561 --> 02:45:56.220
We're very excited about the plan.

02:45:56.220 --> 02:45:57.538
MATT: "I can tell."

02:45:57.538 --> 02:46:03.128
WILL: Yeah. Do we have the 50 soldiers we need, or
do we need to ask them for 50?

02:46:03.128 --> 02:46:05.936
SAM: Did they ever show up? Did the 50 soldiers
from Fort Daxio show up?

02:46:05.936 --> 02:46:11.448
MATT: "I had heard that Daxio had fallen. There
are survivors?"

02:46:11.448 --> 02:46:13.751
LAURA: Well. There were. There were about 55
soldiers.

02:46:13.751 --> 02:46:15.981
MATT: "They haven't found their way to us yet,
then. We'll keep an eye out."

02:46:15.981 --> 02:46:18.979
TALIESIN: They might be headed towards Greyskull,
if I recall. I believe they were heading there.

02:46:18.979 --> 02:46:22.543
LAURA: That's true. They should be crossing paths
very shortly.

02:46:22.543 --> 02:46:26.853
TALIESIN: 50 men can move quietly.

02:46:26.853 --> 02:46:31.939
LAURA: So after you cut through all of the
lizardmen like butter, you'll make your way to

02:46:31.939 --> 02:46:33.219
Thordak?

02:46:33.219 --> 02:46:39.381
MATT: "That's the intent, to push in towards the
Cloudtop. And, based on how well you and/or any of

02:46:39.381 --> 02:46:44.493
"the air forces have been able to puncture the
defenses, push in towards the creature itself and

02:46:44.493 --> 02:46:50.498
"unleash everything we have at the beast. As far as
I know and have been told, from some of the

02:46:50.498 --> 02:46:57.037
"remaining members of the Council, they have a few
members still within the city. I believe Tofor

02:46:57.037 --> 02:47:03.583
"Brotoras, Seeker Asum, and Brom Goldhand are still
within the city."

02:47:03.583 --> 02:47:07.552
SAM: Well, not Asum. We know where he is.

02:47:07.552 --> 02:47:09.874
LAURA: And Brom.

02:47:09.874 --> 02:47:12.365
MARY: I thought Brom was at Whitestone.

02:47:12.365 --> 02:47:14.441
LAURA: Don't say that word out loud.

02:47:14.441 --> 02:47:16.936
MARY: I said it to you, quietly.

02:47:16.936 --> 02:47:19.550
LAURA: Yeah, very quietly.

02:47:19.700 --> 02:47:25.432
TALIESIN: We'll gather what we can. We don't
really know what's actually in there, yet.

02:47:25.432 --> 02:47:27.796
MARISHA: And we can't trust anyone within the city
limits.

02:47:27.796 --> 02:47:29.326
MATT: "Understood."

02:47:29.326 --> 02:47:31.744
WILL: Do you have a time frame? For your attack?

02:47:31.744 --> 02:47:38.095
MATT: "We are intending, once the men have been
fed, once the men have been able to rest and

02:47:38.095 --> 02:47:40.870
"prepare their armaments, we were going to attack
upon sundown, yes."

02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:42.783
WILL: And you plan to breach the city when?

02:47:42.783 --> 02:47:45.480
MATT: "Hopefully within the first hour of the
attack."

02:47:45.480 --> 02:47:47.562
WILL: Really?

02:47:47.562 --> 02:47:49.167
MATT: "That's the intent."

02:47:49.167 --> 02:47:54.343
WILL: How far do you think we can make it in the
tunnels in an hour?

02:47:54.343 --> 02:47:59.579
TALIESIN: Pretty far, to be honest, especially if
we're-- Well, no that's--

02:47:59.579 --> 02:48:00.987
SAM: 20 blocks.

02:48:00.987 --> 02:48:02.647
WILL: You making that number up?

02:48:02.647 --> 02:48:03.582
SAM: Yep.

02:48:03.582 --> 02:48:04.630
WILL: You just pulled that out of nowhere.

02:48:04.630 --> 02:48:05.636
SAM: Absolutely.

02:48:05.636 --> 02:48:09.647
TALIESIN: It's the highest number he knows. Grog's
not here; I have to do something.

02:48:09.647 --> 02:48:14.155
SAM: An hour-- We can probably make it, I don't
know, we can make it deep into the city, but not

02:48:14.155 --> 02:48:15.939
all the way to the center, can we?

02:48:15.939 --> 02:48:17.405
TALIESIN: No, not in an hour.

02:48:17.405 --> 02:48:22.386
LIAM: It's a maze in there. But the tunnel from
our keep in, if it's intact, was not that far.

02:48:22.386 --> 02:48:29.100
MATT: "If you were to traverse the tunnel system
in advance of our attack, that would perhaps aid

02:48:29.100 --> 02:48:31.614
"us in syncing our maneuvers."

02:48:31.614 --> 02:48:33.257
SAM: So we should go now.

02:48:33.257 --> 02:48:38.339
WILL: That would be the goal, is to act as point
for the entire army.

02:48:38.339 --> 02:48:40.634
MATT: "That would indeed be the goal."

02:48:40.634 --> 02:48:43.321
LAURA: So, what, the minute we pop out, we send up
a flare?

02:48:43.321 --> 02:48:49.287
MATT: "Some sort of a sign. Hopefully something
not quite as easy to read as a sign of aggression.

02:48:49.287 --> 02:48:52.294
"We've taken much care to not be seen this far."

02:48:52.294 --> 02:48:57.239
SAM: Or we could just wait for sundown and then
go, knowing that they're going to strike at the

02:48:57.239 --> 02:48:58.212
same time.

02:48:58.212 --> 02:48:59.521
TALIESIN: We go now.

02:48:59.521 --> 02:49:04.354
SAM: No, I mean, once we get in there, we wait
until we pop out, until it's getting dark

02:49:04.354 --> 02:49:05.437
outside.

02:49:05.437 --> 02:49:09.021
LIAM: I mean, what kind of symbol do we send up in
a sky full of wyverns?

02:49:09.021 --> 02:49:11.423
LAURA: What if we're not in position by sundown?

02:49:11.423 --> 02:49:16.046
MARISHA: The Ashari are already looking for a
symbol. I plan to be aiding them. They should be

02:49:16.046 --> 02:49:18.096
helping us with--

02:49:18.096 --> 02:49:19.501
SAM: What about a storm?

02:49:19.501 --> 02:49:21.360
MARISHA: Well, there will be a storm.

02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:22.931
WILL: Wait, there's a storm coming?

02:49:22.931 --> 02:49:24.197
SAM: Can &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; make one?

02:49:24.197 --> 02:49:29.888
MATT: As you guys actually glance over, you can
see in the eastern sky, past the Iron Seat

02:49:29.888 --> 02:49:39.431
Ridge, there is an extremely dark, building
stormfront that is just looming, miles off in the

02:49:39.431 --> 02:49:40.742
distance.

02:49:40.742 --> 02:49:42.071
MARISHA: See? Told you.

02:49:42.071 --> 02:49:47.317
SAM: What about-- Kiki, what if you just made some
lightning strikes to signal the start of the fight?

02:49:47.317 --> 02:49:49.440
TALIESIN: I think nature itself is going to make
some lightning strikes.

02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:54.384
MARISHA: Well, I've got my whole Skywrite thing.
I've got my whole Skywrite thing; I can make a

02:49:54.384 --> 02:50:01.280
symbol in the air out of clouds, which isn't as
terrifying as everyone has thought it is in the

02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:05.199
past. We just need to pick a symbol--

02:50:05.199 --> 02:50:07.643
LAURA: It just has to be subtle, something your
dad will recognize, huh?

02:50:07.643 --> 02:50:09.353
MARY: A phoenix or something.

02:50:09.353 --> 02:50:12.407
WILL: How is the storm going to affect your
attack, is my question.

02:50:12.407 --> 02:50:19.998
MATT: "We are trained to undergo warfare in many
different forms of terrain and weather."

02:50:19.998 --> 02:50:24.525
MARY: My concern is that if we wait until this
storm comes in, the sewers will be flooded. We

02:50:24.525 --> 02:50:26.542
need to go in now before the storm gets here.

02:50:26.542 --> 02:50:29.737
WILL: But if we get lost in there and the storm
comes, it'll be flooded while we're in there.

02:50:29.737 --> 02:50:31.710
SAM: The storm isn't a real storm, isn't it Air
Ashari?

02:50:31.710 --> 02:50:34.083
LAURA: No, no, no, it's Air Ashari.

02:50:34.083 --> 02:50:36.702
TALIESIN: But it's still a real storm.

02:50:36.702 --> 02:50:40.790
MATT: "If there is rain to come with the storm,
that is fortuitous, for much of the city still

02:50:40.790 --> 02:50:45.608
"burns. But fire we can quell with a storm would be
helpful."

02:50:45.608 --> 02:50:48.555
MARISHA: It's a-coming man. It's coming.

02:50:48.555 --> 02:50:50.267
MATT: "Right, good to know this."

02:50:50.267 --> 02:50:52.192
LIAM: Well, let's go.

02:50:52.192 --> 02:50:54.541
SAM: To Greyskull Keep?

02:50:54.541 --> 02:50:59.276
MARISHA: Look for-- Keep your eye on the sky.

02:50:59.276 --> 02:51:04.427
MATT: "I will have two of my hawkeyes keeping an
eye at the clouds"

02:51:04.427 --> 02:51:14.849
MARISHA: There will be a symbol. It will be super
obvious when it's determined. You'll be like, "Oh,

02:51:14.849 --> 02:51:20.099
"of course, it couldn't have been anything else".
When you see it.

02:51:20.099 --> 02:51:25.175
MATT: "I look forward to solving your riddle. You
as well, stay safe."

02:51:25.175 --> 02:51:29.457
MARISHA: Don't know what the fuck it's going to
be. It could be a big "VM" for Vox Machina, I mean

02:51:29.457 --> 02:51:34.129
like you know-- We could be like, Now! Fucking
attack!

02:51:34.129 --> 02:51:39.498
LIAM: Are there clouds overhead now? Above the
city.

02:51:39.498 --> 02:51:43.461
MATT: If you look up, it's-- the weather over
here's been fairly clear. There are a few wispy

02:51:43.461 --> 02:51:47.655
white clouds, but nothing that is indicative of a
storm, yet.

02:51:47.655 --> 02:51:52.455
TALIESIN: If the storm has taken the city, there
will be a break in the storm, of a perfect circle,

02:51:52.455 --> 02:51:53.885
where we are attacking--

02:51:53.885 --> 02:51:55.464
WILL: The eye of a hurricane.

02:51:55.464 --> 02:51:59.756
TALIESIN: The eye of a hurricane. If it is not a
force, we can certainly look for it.

02:51:59.756 --> 02:52:04.077
LIAM: And if the skies are clear, they'll not be
clear.

02:52:04.077 --> 02:52:06.773
TALIESIN: It will be a nice column that will--

02:52:06.773 --> 02:52:08.451
MATT: "All right. Then--"

02:52:08.451 --> 02:52:10.767
WILL: Look for the stillness in the storm.

02:52:10.767 --> 02:52:13.691
MATT: "We shall. Travel safe, travel swift."

02:52:13.691 --> 02:52:15.519
MARY: Safe journey.

02:52:15.519 --> 02:52:17.085
MATT: "You as well, good luck."

02:52:17.085 --> 02:52:22.901
SAM: Be pleased. Remember, the plan is chaos.

02:52:22.901 --> 02:52:25.084
LAURA: Total chaos.

02:52:25.084 --> 02:52:26.854
WILL: Chaos can work.

02:52:26.854 --> 02:52:28.300
TALIESIN: Chaos works very well.

02:52:28.300 --> 02:52:29.718
LAURA: We make our way to Greyskull.

02:52:29.718 --> 02:52:32.835
TALIESIN: Back to Greyskull.

02:52:32.835 --> 02:52:43.460
MATT: All right. As you guys make your way towards
Greyskull Keep. Walking through, as you see rows

02:52:43.460 --> 02:52:47.699
and rows of soldiers of different walks of life,
all part of the alliance of Tal'Dorei between

02:52:47.699 --> 02:52:57.280
Syngorn and Emon. Many of them watch as you pass,
some just curious as to what regiment you belong

02:52:57.280 --> 02:53:00.563
to, and you get a couple of occasional looks of
recognition.

02:53:00.563 --> 02:53:04.734
LAURA: I wink.

02:53:04.734 --> 02:53:07.438
WILL: Dale? Where you been, man?

02:53:07.438 --> 02:53:10.228
MATT: "Wait! Kash?"

02:53:10.228 --> 02:53:12.097
WILL: What the hell's going on?

02:53:12.097 --> 02:53:13.779
MATT: "Going to die today, what are you doing?"

02:53:13.779 --> 02:53:15.569
WILL: Pretty much the same thing man, how's Anne?

02:53:15.569 --> 02:53:19.991
MATT: "Anne's not doing too well."

02:53:19.991 --> 02:53:21.536
WILL: Aw, I'm sorry to hear that.

02:53:21.536 --> 02:53:23.775
MATT: "Yeah, she was in the city when the dragons
attacked."

02:53:23.775 --> 02:53:25.705
WILL: No! She wasn't.

02:53:25.705 --> 02:53:26.795
MATT: "Yeah."

02:53:26.795 --> 02:53:28.175
WILL: Oh, that's horrible!

02:53:28.175 --> 02:53:29.503
MATT: "It's okay, we're going to kill them today,
right?"

02:53:29.503 --> 02:53:31.327
WILL: We're getting there buddy. Good to see you,
you're looking good.

02:53:31.327 --> 02:53:32.460
MATT: "Good to see you too, you too!"

02:53:32.460 --> 02:53:33.696
WILL: All right, I'll see you later, man.

02:53:33.696 --> 02:53:34.594
MATT: "All right."

02:53:34.594 --> 02:53:39.071
WILL: That was-- I haven't seen that guy in
forever. So bizarre. Sorry, let's go.

02:53:39.071 --> 02:53:44.172
SAM: Small world man, small world.

02:53:44.172 --> 02:53:49.078
LIAM: And we're walking and we're walking and
we're walking.

02:53:49.078 --> 02:53:53.954
TALIESIN: I feel like I've had that awkward four
minutes of like every con ever. Oh god!

02:53:53.954 --> 02:54:09.151
MATT: As you guys exit the side ranks of the
current encampment, as they are all preparing, the

02:54:09.151 --> 02:54:16.083
sun itself growing maybe about two hours out from
touching the horizon, you can see, in the

02:54:16.083 --> 02:54:21.589
distance, on some of the outer embankment and
small structures that litter the walls of Emon's

02:54:21.589 --> 02:54:31.710
surrounding fields, you see Greyskull Keep, a very
welcoming, longtime coming return. As you stay low

02:54:31.710 --> 02:54:33.944
to the grass, I need you all to make stealth
checks

02:54:33.944 --> 02:54:38.135
LAURA: Oh shit. Oh shit, oh shit. You roll a 20.
And then you--

02:54:38.135 --> 02:54:40.611
MARISHA: Oh, natural 20!

02:54:40.611 --> 02:54:41.776
MATT: Nice!

02:54:41.776 --> 02:54:43.827
SAM: Natural 20 right here as well.

02:54:43.827 --> 02:54:45.826
MARISHA: Really? Eh! Natural 20 bros!

02:54:45.826 --> 02:54:47.598
TALIESIN: Natural 19, I haven't added yet.

02:54:47.598 --> 02:54:48.767
MARISHA: Fuck you.

02:54:48.767 --> 02:54:50.589
MARY: Ten!

02:54:50.589 --> 02:54:54.255
LAURA: Should I cast Pass Without a Trace on all
of us? Is it too late? Can I just add it to

02:54:54.255 --> 02:54:56.154
everybody's if I cast it now?

02:54:56.154 --> 02:55:01.211
MATT: As you guys were going stealthy, I'll say
sure. Because you would have known, at this point

02:55:01.211 --> 02:55:03.250
to do so. If you want to spend your spell slot to
do that, sure.

02:55:03.250 --> 02:55:04.697
LAURA: I do.

02:55:04.697 --> 02:55:05.707
LIAM: And that's plus ten, right?

02:55:05.707 --> 02:55:07.693
LAURA: Yeah, it adds ten to all of your rolls.

02:55:07.693 --> 02:55:08.584
MARY: 20.

02:55:08.584 --> 02:55:10.023
LIAM: 35, now.

02:55:10.023 --> 02:55:11.709
LAURA: 30.

02:55:11.709 --> 02:55:14.839
TALIESIN: 35, 35 with the plus ten. 35.

02:55:14.839 --> 02:55:19.614
MATT: All right. As you guys all stay low and
guarding each other, keeping an eye out to make

02:55:19.614 --> 02:55:24.826
sure nobody is giving too much away. You manage
to go unnoticed--

02:55:24.826 --> 02:55:27.768
MARISHA: (coughing) Sorry, I so inhaled my spit,
keep going.

02:55:27.768 --> 02:55:30.506
MATT: Don't do that. That's bad.

02:55:30.506 --> 02:55:32.239
WILL: Make a breathing saving throw.

02:55:32.239 --> 02:55:37.956
MARISHA: (coughing) I'm still dying for a second.
Go on, guys.

02:55:37.956 --> 02:55:39.653
LIAM: I rolled double ones. (wheezing)

02:55:39.653 --> 02:55:52.534
MATT: You guys make your way to Greyskull Keep,
front door's open. Like, partially ajar. Not locked.

02:55:52.534 --> 02:55:57.312
LIAM: I move in, forward.

02:55:57.312 --> 02:55:59.318
MATT: Okay, you head inside first.

02:55:59.318 --> 02:56:00.665
LIAM: I'm going to poke my head in first.

02:56:00.665 --> 02:56:02.723
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:56:02.723 --> 02:56:05.404
LIAM: 27.

02:56:05.404 --> 02:56:11.068
MATT: You take a moment and look around, listen
carefully. No sound.

02:56:11.068 --> 02:56:18.263
LIAM: So far so good. I'm going to move further
in. And continue to-- I'm going to check for traps.

02:56:18.263 --> 02:56:21.050
MATT: Go for it. Investigation check.

02:56:21.050 --> 02:56:24.297
LIAM: Fine, sure, investigation is an 18.

02:56:24.297 --> 02:56:29.065
MATT: Okay. Nothing appears to be trapped here. If
anything is out of place, you know this area

02:56:29.065 --> 02:56:31.001
pretty well, so.

02:56:31.001 --> 02:56:34.464
LAURA: We're making our way to the doorway, we
peek in now.

02:56:34.464 --> 02:56:36.243
MARY: Is it very dark in there?

02:56:36.243 --> 02:56:42.816
MATT: There are no current set torches or
candlelight whatsoever, there are a few openings

02:56:42.816 --> 02:56:46.871
that bring some light in. Specifically from
Sarenrae's temple. But other than that, it is

02:56:46.871 --> 02:56:48.050
pretty dark in the hallways.

02:56:48.050 --> 02:56:49.954
MARY: Can I see anything with darkvision?

02:56:49.954 --> 02:56:53.565
MATT: With darkvision, you're fine. As you guys
glance around and begin to scatter throughout the

02:56:53.565 --> 02:57:03.149
keep, you can see signs that it has been lived in.
People have been rummaging through, there is no

02:57:03.149 --> 02:57:08.579
sign of any food whatsoever in the keep anymore,
there are a number of bowls and anything of any

02:57:08.579 --> 02:57:17.255
remote value has either been taken or is left used
and unwashed. But after doing a quick scan, there

02:57:17.255 --> 02:57:21.286
is no one inside Greyskull Keep. Apparently--

02:57:21.286 --> 02:57:22.733
LIAM: Like, the whole place?

02:57:22.733 --> 02:57:23.920
MATT: Yeah.

02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:28.131
LIAM: So all the way up the stairs, to our
bedrooms, to his laboratory, all that's clear?

02:57:28.131 --> 02:57:31.384
MATT: All of it's empty, but a lot of things have
been taken.

02:57:31.384 --> 02:57:39.546
SAM: Can I go in the kitchen and just sort of
sense magic, or do an arcana check or something,

02:57:39.546 --> 02:57:40.927
to see if there's any--

02:57:40.927 --> 02:57:43.542
MATT: There is a Detect Magic spell, if you have
that.

02:57:43.542 --> 02:57:44.593
SAM: I don't have that.

02:57:44.593 --> 02:57:47.763
MATT: Then you would be hard-pressed to detect if
it's present necessarily.

02:57:47.763 --> 02:57:50.263
MARISHA: Is your poop still around?

02:57:50.263 --> 02:57:53.879
SAM: My poop is still there, it's just inert. It's
&lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; poop.

02:57:53.879 --> 02:57:55.935
LAURA: Did somebody steal the poop?

02:57:55.935 --> 02:57:58.583
SAM: Oh, is it still there in the jar that I left
it in?

02:57:58.583 --> 02:58:06.897
MATT: Actually, there is a broken jar on the
ground. It looks like somebody discovered it and

02:58:06.897 --> 02:58:09.761
wasn't quite sure what it was, and then discovered
what it was.

02:58:09.761 --> 02:58:11.156
MARY: This isn't pudding!

02:58:11.156 --> 02:58:13.792
(laughter)

02:58:13.792 --> 02:58:15.911
LIAM: This single scoop tastes funny.

02:58:15.911 --> 02:58:18.769
MARY: Gelato? (retches)

02:58:18.769 --> 02:58:29.538
MATT: The behavioral patterns of the way things
are left, it looks like people have come in

02:58:29.538 --> 02:58:33.416
through, rummaged, grabbed what they needed to
survive, or what seemed of value, and left. And

02:58:33.416 --> 02:58:38.027
things they didn't understand, or didn't see value
in, they left behind. Most of your workshop has

02:58:38.027 --> 02:58:39.982
been ransacked.

02:58:39.982 --> 02:58:41.315
TALIESIN: I figured.

02:58:41.315 --> 02:58:46.086
MATT: Your cask is still there. And a few esoteric
tools that they didn't really understand, or too

02:58:46.086 --> 02:58:50.810
big to maneuver, are still there. But most of your
toolset is gone.

02:58:50.810 --> 02:59:02.795
TALIESIN: Grabbing what's useful, and maybe as a
lark I might try and run a wire from my inert

02:59:02.795 --> 02:59:10.635
glove to Cabal's Ruin to see if I can actually get
the charge to travel through it if I punch

02:59:10.635 --> 02:59:11.800
something.

02:59:11.800 --> 02:59:14.402
MATT: If you want to use one of the charges, you
can try that.

02:59:14.402 --> 02:59:19.340
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll use a charge-- I'll hold.
I'll find out in the moment, won't I?

02:59:19.340 --> 02:59:20.866
MATT: Yeah, that you will.

02:59:20.866 --> 02:59:22.454
MARISHA: Try it on the day.

02:59:22.454 --> 02:59:24.259
WILL: Is this your castle?

02:59:24.259 --> 02:59:27.086
SAM: Yeah, this is our house. This is our keep.

02:59:27.086 --> 02:59:28.457
TALIESIN: It's a keep, not a castle.

02:59:28.457 --> 02:59:31.731
MARY: This is lovely. It's a little cold.

02:59:31.731 --> 02:59:33.162
SAM: But it's seen better days.

02:59:33.162 --> 02:59:35.331
MARY: But the bones are good.

02:59:35.331 --> 02:59:36.908
WILL: Lot of space.

02:59:36.908 --> 02:59:39.456
SAM: It's a fixer-upper.

02:59:39.456 --> 02:59:40.677
MARY: Good location.

02:59:40.677 --> 02:59:49.258
LIAM: I'm going downstairs to the entrance, and
I'm going to check it out. And use Divine Sense at

02:59:49.258 --> 02:59:50.490
the entrance.

02:59:50.490 --> 02:59:52.404
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

02:59:52.404 --> 03:00:04.026
LIAM: All right. That's good. That is a 24.

03:00:04.026 --> 03:00:10.948
MATT: Okay. Divine Sense doesn't trigger anything
off. Nothing gets you riled up in that sense.

03:00:10.948 --> 03:00:12.499
LIAM: Feathers are in place?

03:00:12.499 --> 03:00:18.834
MATT: Indeed, yes. Except the two that were cut
earlier from Kashaw. But you do find the hidden

03:00:18.897 --> 03:00:24.457
entrance, or the exit I guess you could say from
the keep, left as it was, untouched. The seam

03:00:24.457 --> 03:00:27.534
still smooth, covered in dust.

03:00:27.534 --> 03:00:28.901
LIAM: Nothing hinky with it?

03:00:28.901 --> 03:00:30.140
MATT: Nothing hinky, no traps.

03:00:30.140 --> 03:00:34.262
SAM: Let's go down to the secret path. We're in a
hurry now, we've got to get into the city.

03:00:34.262 --> 03:00:40.100
TALIESIN: Oh, I show Kashaw the cask, by the way. I
have some powdered death, if you like. This will

03:00:40.100 --> 03:00:42.151
explode very loudly.

03:00:42.151 --> 03:00:44.037
WILL: How much damage?

03:00:44.037 --> 03:00:51.738
TALIESIN: You know, I've honestly been too nervous
to ever find out. Because everybody who plays with

03:00:51.738 --> 03:00:53.647
this loses a limb eventually.

03:00:53.647 --> 03:00:55.231
WILL: Is it heavy?

03:00:55.231 --> 03:01:00.615
MATT: You hear this faint echoing voice in the
back of your head that says, "Learn from my mistakes..."

03:01:00.615 --> 03:01:04.239
(laughter)

03:01:04.239 --> 03:01:06.685
WILL: I say we bring it.

03:01:06.685 --> 03:01:08.286
TALIESIN: That's my plan.

03:01:08.286 --> 03:01:16.649
SAM: Can I just give you a quick note? Planning
Kashaw is very staccato. He's very clipped. I feel

03:01:16.649 --> 03:01:21.687
like when you're just talking normally, you're so
warm and pleasant. But when you're planning, you

03:01:21.687 --> 03:01:29.240
get this voice you use that's very grating. I'm
just saying, try to even out your tone. Do some

03:01:29.240 --> 03:01:31.998
breathing exercises, breathe from the diaphragm.

03:01:31.998 --> 03:01:34.750
WILL: (breathes) Let's go.

03:01:34.750 --> 03:01:38.154
(laughter)

03:01:38.154 --> 03:01:39.694
TALIESIN: To the tunnels.

03:01:39.694 --> 03:01:42.711
MATT: All right. Grog happily takes the cask under
his arm.

03:01:42.711 --> 03:01:44.916
LAURA: Don't drink that, Grog.

03:01:44.916 --> 03:01:46.350
MATT: "Oh come on! One--"

03:01:46.350 --> 03:01:48.796
LAURA: No, none of it. No--

03:01:48.796 --> 03:01:52.895
(laughter)

03:01:52.895 --> 03:01:54.181
MATT: "Okay."

03:01:54.181 --> 03:01:56.228
MARY: He could fart explosives if he did.

03:01:56.228 --> 03:01:59.234
SAM: Matt's Grog and Matt's Trinket are very
similar.

03:01:59.234 --> 03:02:09.667
MATT: To be fair. You guys all-- single-file,
because this tunnel is not very wide, it's maybe

03:02:09.667 --> 03:02:17.552
four feet wide-- you make your way through and
it's a long, musty tunnel. It smells of damp earth

03:02:17.552 --> 03:02:19.590
and dust.

03:02:19.590 --> 03:02:23.069
LAURA: We need to pass out these healing potions
before we get anywhere.

03:02:23.069 --> 03:02:25.762
LIAM: Well, why don't everybody bunch up for a
second then?

03:02:25.762 --> 03:02:27.092
LAURA: Yeah.

03:02:27.092 --> 03:02:29.277
MARY: Is there light in there? Do you need light,
are there torches?

03:02:29.277 --> 03:02:31.079
MATT: There is no light.

03:02:31.079 --> 03:02:33.281
MARY: I cast Light.

03:02:33.281 --> 03:02:40.166
LAURA: All right, we have three greater healings,
five regular healings, and two superiors. Who needs what?

03:02:40.166 --> 03:02:41.613
TALIESIN: I'll take a greater.

03:02:41.613 --> 03:02:43.656
LIAM: Superior, please. I'm weak as fuck.

03:02:43.656 --> 03:02:44.957
LAURA: All right, take one.

03:02:44.957 --> 03:02:47.303
TALIESIN: I'd like to take a greater as well,
because I'm always far away.

03:02:47.303 --> 03:02:48.200
LAURA: Okay.

03:02:48.200 --> 03:02:49.962
MATT: "Greater for me." Grog raises his hand.

03:02:49.962 --> 03:02:51.105
LAURA: He wants one?

03:02:51.105 --> 03:02:52.016
MATT "Please."

03:02:52.016 --> 03:02:53.293
LAURA: You want a greater or--

03:02:53.293 --> 03:02:54.295
MATT: "Yes, please."

03:02:54.295 --> 03:02:59.560
LAURA: Okay, we have one greater left. Five
regulars, so I'll pass out regulars to-- Do you

03:02:59.560 --> 03:03:01.109
need any? You, you--

03:03:01.109 --> 03:03:03.210
WILL: I should be okay with healing, but if you'd
like I'll take one.

03:03:03.210 --> 03:03:05.423
MARISHA: I'm all right. I still have a couple.

03:03:05.423 --> 03:03:08.376
MARY: I have one normal, and two greater, and one
superior.

03:03:08.376 --> 03:03:10.105
LAURA: There's one superior left. Oh, you already
have a superior?

03:03:10.105 --> 03:03:12.273
MARY: I have a superior, two greater, and one
normal.

03:03:12.273 --> 03:03:14.324
LAURA: Oh shit. You have a fuckton of potions!

03:03:14.324 --> 03:03:19.635
SAM: I'll take a superior and one of them fire
resistance, please.

03:03:19.635 --> 03:03:23.874
LAURA: Take the superior, Scanlan.

03:03:23.874 --> 03:03:26.132
SAM: I need the stuff.

03:03:26.132 --> 03:03:30.611
LAURA: Zero superior and four fire potions. I'm
taking one of the fire potions as well, so that's

03:03:30.611 --> 03:03:32.159
three fire potions left.

03:03:32.159 --> 03:03:33.341
MARISHA: If I could have a fire potion?

03:03:33.341 --> 03:03:34.677
LAURA: Yes, two fire potions left.

03:03:34.677 --> 03:03:36.513
MARY: Should Pike have a fire potion?

03:03:36.513 --> 03:03:37.870
LAURA: Pike has fire resistance.

03:03:37.870 --> 03:03:41.165
MARY: I don't know, I've only met her once.

03:03:41.165 --> 03:03:44.623
TALIESIN: I would love a fire resistance
potion, if one exists.

03:03:44.623 --> 03:03:46.981
LAURA: Of course darling, whatever you need.

03:03:46.981 --> 03:03:50.026
WILL: No, I have fire-resistant plate, but I'd
love a healing potion, if you have an extra.

03:03:50.026 --> 03:03:52.528
LAURA: You want to take two regulars?

03:03:52.528 --> 03:03:53.532
WILL: Sure.

03:03:53.532 --> 03:03:56.339
TALIESIN: I'll take the fire resistance. All
right, one fire resistance.

03:03:56.339 --> 03:04:04.095
MATT: As you guys are awkwardly passing this down
this singular tunnel, having to almost chain it

03:04:04.095 --> 03:04:05.547
back and forth.

03:04:05.547 --> 03:04:08.486
MARISHA: I load up Grog's camelback with healing
potions.

03:04:08.486 --> 03:04:14.392
LAURA: Now, the potion of invulnerability. Is
there someone specific we need to give that to?

03:04:14.392 --> 03:04:18.540
MATT: "It sounds really neat."

03:04:18.540 --> 03:04:21.044
SAM: Why don't we give it to Grog for now?

03:04:21.044 --> 03:04:23.492
TALIESIN: Well, Grog already halves all of his
damage.

03:04:23.492 --> 03:04:29.436
LIAM: Grog, if we give it to you now, you can't
drink it now. Not now. You have to wait.

03:04:29.436 --> 03:04:34.334
TALIESIN: Quick rule point, if he already takes a
lot of half damage, if he takes the potion, it

03:04:34.334 --> 03:04:36.113
doesn't really affect?

03:04:36.113 --> 03:04:37.203
LAURA: Does it quarter the damage?

03:04:37.203 --> 03:04:39.441
MATT: No. He just likes being invulnerable.

03:04:39.441 --> 03:04:41.934
TALIESIN: It should go to Vax.

03:04:41.934 --> 03:04:43.906
LIAM: I didn't wanna--

03:04:43.906 --> 03:04:46.739
TALIESIN: Because you're gonna get close.

03:04:46.739 --> 03:04:50.275
LIAM: I'm gonna get up in his shit.

03:04:50.275 --> 03:04:52.435
TALIESIN: So you should take the potion.

03:04:52.435 --> 03:04:55.923
It doubles your HP, double your HP.

03:04:55.923 --> 03:05:01.037
LIAM: I just wanted you to be able to pl-- excuse
me? Can I have that, Grog?

03:05:01.037 --> 03:05:03.763
LAURA: I still have it. I didn't give it to him.

03:05:03.763 --> 03:05:05.578
LIAM: Can I have that, please?

03:05:05.578 --> 03:05:07.477
MATT: "What do you want to give me?"

03:05:07.477 --> 03:05:09.948
LAURA: You don't have it, Grog. You don't have the
potion.

03:05:09.948 --> 03:05:11.125
MATT: "Oh--"

03:05:11.125 --> 03:05:13.350
LIAM: He's holding a wood chip.

03:05:13.350 --> 03:05:18.037
TALIESIN: Where did you find a purple wood chip
down here? That's, oh--

03:05:18.037 --> 03:05:22.359
MATT: Travis just texted me saying he does not
have resistance to fire, which I knew. So if

03:05:22.359 --> 03:05:23.589
anyone would like to--

03:05:23.589 --> 03:05:25.099
LAURA: Oh! Okay, well then he gets the last--

03:05:25.099 --> 03:05:28.197
MATT: The last one is Grog. He takes it and is
about to open the cork.

03:05:28.197 --> 03:05:32.608
LAURA: No, no! Grog, wait for when we start
fighting Thordak.

03:05:32.608 --> 03:05:34.805
MATT: "What can I drink?"

03:05:34.805 --> 03:05:35.887
LAURA: Some ale.

03:05:35.887 --> 03:05:36.790
MATT: "Okay."

03:05:36.790 --> 03:05:39.653
SAM: Use your magic canister.

03:05:39.653 --> 03:05:40.970
MATT: (whispers) "Mayonnaise."

03:05:40.970 --> 03:05:44.637
(laughter)

03:05:44.637 --> 03:05:47.604
MARY: I would also like to evoke Fiendish Vigor.

03:05:47.604 --> 03:05:48.983
SAM: What's that?

03:05:48.983 --> 03:05:54.314
MARY: Which means I can cast False Life on myself
for one hour, yeah?

03:05:54.314 --> 03:05:55.411
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

03:05:55.411 --> 03:05:56.595
LAURA: Do you do it now?

03:05:56.595 --> 03:05:58.134
MARY: Well, we're about to go in.

03:05:58.134 --> 03:06:00.359
SAM: It's gonna take us an hour to get to the
center of the city.

03:06:00.359 --> 03:06:08.296
MARY: All right, right before we go in, I'll hold
it. Grog, give me a drink! Just one small one!

03:06:08.296 --> 03:06:14.294
Just a shot. Don't look at me like that, I just
want a shot.

03:06:14.294 --> 03:06:20.394
MATT: It's like an urn-type cask, and he holds it
over to you, and it's just filled with mayonnaise.

03:06:20.394 --> 03:06:27.928
MARY: Ah-- It's so delicious, thank you so much.
No, all right.

03:06:27.928 --> 03:06:32.064
MATT: "Sour, isn't it?"

03:06:32.064 --> 03:06:34.595
TALIESIN: Sweet, bitter, angry.

03:06:34.595 --> 03:06:41.794
MARY: It's good. It's only four or five days old.

03:06:41.794 --> 03:06:43.571
WILL: You pull out your whiskey, but Kash is
already naked.

03:06:43.571 --> 03:06:45.514
(laughter)

03:06:45.514 --> 03:06:47.933
TALIESIN: I hand the bottle to Kash.

03:06:47.933 --> 03:06:50.533
SAM: Let's go!

03:06:50.533 --> 03:06:55.987
LAURA: I'm gonna give-- I don't know if Pike has
any healing potions, so I'm gonna give her a

03:06:55.987 --> 03:06:57.904
regular healing potion just for something.

03:06:57.904 --> 03:07:02.539
MARISHA: We're going out like we came in!

03:07:02.539 --> 03:07:06.700
LIAM : We're in a little tunnel passing things up
and down in a little single file.

03:07:06.700 --> 03:07:09.014
TALIESIN: Eating mayonnaise out of a jar.

03:07:09.014 --> 03:07:14.969
MARISHA: Kash, pass the trail mix. Pass it all the
way back.

03:07:14.969 --> 03:07:16.680
MARY: I smell a new sponsor!

03:07:16.680 --> 03:07:18.198
TALIESIN: Mayonnaise?

03:07:18.198 --> 03:07:25.480
MATT: You guys eventually find your way towards
the end of the tunnel that leads to the ladder

03:07:25.480 --> 03:07:30.490
that leads you into the alleyway on the outskirts
of the southern edge of Emon. You make your way

03:07:30.490 --> 03:07:35.645
up-- Well, it leads you through an outhouse, an
alley. You've been here before.

03:07:35.645 --> 03:07:39.916
LIAM: I'm gonna, yes, I'm gonna peek through the
pooper first. Let's see what I see.

03:07:39.916 --> 03:07:41.749
MATT: Perception check.

03:07:41.749 --> 03:07:43.234
LIAM: Yeah. Okay, that's fine.

03:07:43.234 --> 03:07:45.646
LAURA: We know where the entrance to the tunnels
are, though.

03:07:45.646 --> 03:07:48.622
LIAM: I'm just looking for anything unexpected,
27.

03:07:48.622 --> 03:07:50.685
MATT: It is empty and still chained.

03:07:50.685 --> 03:07:51.973
LIAM: Are there poos?

03:07:51.973 --> 03:07:55.719
MATT: No. It is chained shut for that reason.

03:07:55.719 --> 03:07:56.912
LIAM: It's clear.

03:07:56.912 --> 03:08:02.451
SAM: Should I-- Before we go out there, should I
Seeming us as lizard people? Yes?

03:08:02.451 --> 03:08:04.405
LAURA: Can you do it to all of us?

03:08:04.405 --> 03:08:07.270
SAM: I can do eight. Wait, is that right?

03:08:07.270 --> 03:08:11.922
MARISHA: Do we? What time is it? What time of day
is it?

03:08:11.922 --> 03:08:20.074
MATT: It's maybe like, at this time? After
travelling this far in Emon, you're maybe 40

03:08:20.074 --> 03:08:21.446
minutes from sunset.

03:08:21.446 --> 03:08:25.754
SAM: Want to be lizard people or no?

03:08:25.754 --> 03:08:27.354
WILL: Has the storm hit?

03:08:27.354 --> 03:08:29.569
MATT: The storm is getting closer.

03:08:29.569 --> 03:08:34.601
TALIESIN: I think that we will not act like lizard
people, and also anybody who can see through,

03:08:34.601 --> 03:08:36.115
there are like--

03:08:36.115 --> 03:08:37.615
LAURA: Lizard people can't see through that.

03:08:37.615 --> 03:08:39.884
TALIESIN: They are idiots. But they also--

03:08:39.884 --> 03:08:46.012
SAM: All we need is a second to get some
confusion.

03:08:46.012 --> 03:08:49.762
TALIESIN: They're used to seeing humans, though,
and as long as we scatter and are fearful they'll--

03:08:49.762 --> 03:08:58.078
MATT: "I don't mind being invisible. That's not an
issue. Meaning I can make a number of us invisible

03:08:58.078 --> 03:08:59.569
"if you want to go--"

03:08:59.569 --> 03:09:00.801
LAURA: How many can you?

03:09:00.801 --> 03:09:05.555
MATT: "Not all of you, obviously! But like, if
some of you wanna go as lizardfolk or somebody

03:09:05.555 --> 03:09:06.347
"else can--"

03:09:06.347 --> 03:09:07.540
LAURA: I want to be invisible!

03:09:07.540 --> 03:09:08.675
LIAM: Invisible, please.

03:09:08.675 --> 03:09:09.858
SAM: You've got a ring that makes you invisible!

03:09:09.858 --> 03:09:16.801
LIAM: I'm busy with other things. Also, it's maybe
time for another Feast? Isn't it?

03:09:16.801 --> 03:09:18.357
TALIESIN: We're still good, I think.

03:09:18.357 --> 03:09:22.168
LIAM: It's about sundown. When we did it last-- We
did it before beddie-bye.

03:09:22.168 --> 03:09:25.335
SAM: But that takes an hour, we're not gonna sit
here in the sewer eating a fucking--

03:09:25.335 --> 03:09:29.729
LIAM: We cannot fucking fight Thordak without a
Heroes' Feast.

03:09:29.729 --> 03:09:32.044
MARISHA: How long has it been? Is it almost up?

03:09:32.044 --> 03:09:33.394
WILL: 40 minutes until battle.

03:09:33.394 --> 03:09:36.947
MATT: Well, I mean, you guys-- It's about 40
minutes until sundown.

03:09:36.947 --> 03:09:38.766
SAM: We don't have time.

03:09:38.766 --> 03:09:40.401
LAURA: Can we eat a really fast feast?

03:09:40.401 --> 03:09:41.982
TALIESIN: McFeast.

03:09:41.982 --> 03:09:46.788
MARISHA: When did we eat the feast last night?
About this time? Are we about to expire or can we

03:09:46.788 --> 03:09:49.178
push it? Was it a midnight snack?

03:09:49.178 --> 03:09:54.350
MATT: You guys would choose the most optimal time,
since there was no rush to eat the feast.

03:09:54.350 --> 03:09:55.735
LAURA: Yes! We would have.

03:09:55.735 --> 03:09:58.660
MATT: You would have been like, well shit, let's
do it at 6:00 because we're fighting-- That's

03:09:58.660 --> 03:10:07.039
probably when you guys would've. So you probably
have until the end of the evening.

03:10:07.039 --> 03:10:08.943
LIAM: Three or four hours-ish.

03:10:08.943 --> 03:10:11.386
MATT: There would have been no benefit to doing it
earlier.

03:10:11.386 --> 03:10:17.079
TALIESIN: This is going to be over before that.
These things move quickly.

03:10:17.079 --> 03:10:20.364
SAM: Am I turning us into lizard people?

03:10:20.364 --> 03:10:22.439
LAURA: Some of us, but I'm invisible because of
Gilmore.

03:10:22.439 --> 03:10:27.236
MARISHA: Are we making an above-ground jump to the
underground tunnels again?

03:10:27.236 --> 03:10:29.662
WILL: Someone knows where they're going, right?

03:10:29.662 --> 03:10:32.157
MARY: Where's the Clasp? Are we going to meet up
with them at some point?

03:10:32.157 --> 03:10:34.917
TALIESIN: Once we're down there, they'll know
we're here.

03:10:34.917 --> 03:10:43.023
MARISHA: How far is the tunnel jump? How long do
we have to be above ground? I'm asking because I

03:10:43.023 --> 03:10:49.745
might be able to make some holes in the wall to
cut us into other tunnels and not have to go above

03:10:49.745 --> 03:10:51.007
ground at all.

03:10:51.007 --> 03:10:58.028
MATT: When you recall Garthok leading you through
Emon to get to the Clasp entrance, you had to be

03:10:58.028 --> 03:11:01.606
above ground for probably about 20 minutes.

03:11:01.606 --> 03:11:02.819
MARISHA: 20 minutes?!

03:11:02.819 --> 03:11:04.248
WILL: That's a lifetime above ground.

03:11:04.248 --> 03:11:09.550
MATT: A lot of it was spent slow because you guys
were stealthy, jumping from alley to alley and

03:11:09.550 --> 03:11:15.347
being very stealthy. If it was a brisk pace, it
could be as fast as ten.

03:11:15.347 --> 03:11:19.810
MARISHA: That was to the entrance to the Clasp,
not the entrance to the sewer system, right?

03:11:19.810 --> 03:11:20.950
MATT: Correct.

03:11:20.950 --> 03:11:23.317
LAURA: We could just pop down to a sewer. Do we
see a sewer hole?

03:11:23.317 --> 03:11:25.669
MATT: If you want to go inspect, you could look
for one.

03:11:25.669 --> 03:11:28.179
SAM: Then we have to find our way through the
sewer that we don't really know how to get

03:11:28.179 --> 03:11:30.168
through. We should find the Clasp entrance.

03:11:30.168 --> 03:11:33.936
LAURA: This plan is smart. Wait, once we get to
the Clasp, then we have to fucking talk to the Clasp.

03:11:33.936 --> 03:11:35.237
SAM: Yeah, for a second.

03:11:35.237 --> 03:11:36.463
LAURA: All right.

03:11:36.463 --> 03:11:38.935
MARY: They're going to help us, right?

03:11:38.935 --> 03:11:43.292
LAURA: It's all on Scanlan; he's very charming.
Kash, don't talk when we're in there.

03:11:43.292 --> 03:11:45.404
WILL: I won't speak. Remember that time I saved
your life?

03:11:45.404 --> 03:11:49.823
LAURA: It was wonderful, and I'm very grateful.

03:11:49.823 --> 03:11:52.378
WILL: No, we're good.

03:11:52.378 --> 03:11:55.993
LAURA: I'm very glad you're here, though.

03:11:55.993 --> 03:11:57.539
WILL: Thank you, that's very sweet.

03:11:57.539 --> 03:11:59.845
MATT: "All right, are we lizarding and then
invis-ing?"

03:11:59.845 --> 03:12:05.347
LAURA: Yes, and then we're going to go quickly to
the Clasp entrance.

03:12:05.347 --> 03:12:08.728
SAM: All right, I'll make us all lizard people,
even the ones turning invisible.

03:12:08.728 --> 03:12:10.750
LAURA: No! I don't want to be a lizard person.

03:12:10.750 --> 03:12:12.669
WILL: Invisible lizard people!

03:12:12.669 --> 03:12:14.955
TALIESIN: We need someone who can turn invisible.

03:12:14.955 --> 03:12:18.802
SAM: Except for myself. Myself, I'll put the Hat
of Disguise on.

03:12:18.802 --> 03:12:21.012
MATT: And you're attuning to that?

03:12:21.012 --> 03:12:22.937
SAM: It's an attuned?!

03:12:22.937 --> 03:12:25.304
LIAM: Only if it says it. Does it say it?

03:12:25.304 --> 03:12:27.276
SAM: Do I have it? I gave it to you.

03:12:27.276 --> 03:12:30.626
TALIESIN: And I gave it back. That was a long time
ago. Years.

03:12:30.626 --> 03:12:33.192
SAM: Fine, I'll make myself a lizard person, too.

03:12:33.192 --> 03:12:35.849
WILL: An invisible lizard person.

03:12:35.849 --> 03:12:37.198
LIAM: A little lizard person.

03:12:37.198 --> 03:12:40.227
MARY: Sam, I can do me.

03:12:40.227 --> 03:12:43.107
LAURA: Don't waste a spell.

03:12:43.107 --> 03:12:44.847
MARY: I'm not. It's an invocation.

03:12:44.847 --> 03:12:46.911
MATT: Seeming affects how many people?

03:12:46.911 --> 03:12:53.040
SAM: As many as are near me when I cast it. Any
number of creatures, it says.

03:12:53.040 --> 03:12:58.003
MATT: That is awesome! Seeming is broken!

03:12:58.003 --> 03:13:00.116
SAM: Seeming is broken.

03:13:00.116 --> 03:13:05.605
TALIESIN: How appropriate that we're going to be
underground lizard people in the city of Los Angeles.

03:13:05.605 --> 03:13:07.730
MARISHA: Yeah, it's very appropriate.

03:13:07.730 --> 03:13:13.941
TALIESIN: It is our best urban myth. The lizard
people of Los Angeles.

03:13:13.941 --> 03:13:17.163
WILL: That's not a myth. I have a friend who knows
somebody who saw one.

03:13:17.163 --> 03:13:18.614
TALIESIN: That's true!

03:13:18.614 --> 03:13:24.487
SAM: I make them all very skinny,
not-well-nourished lizard people. Except for me.

03:13:24.487 --> 03:13:26.567
I'm pretty big.

03:13:26.567 --> 03:13:33.960
MATT: You now have a cluster. As Gilmore begins
his incantation for the Invisibility spell for

03:13:33.960 --> 03:13:41.776
him, Vax, and Vex, you guys all watch as each of
your forms become these emaciated lizardfolk,

03:13:41.776 --> 03:13:50.387
except for Scanlan, who is this much shorter, but
Wolverine-stocky-looking lizardman.

03:13:50.387 --> 03:13:52.613
SAM: It's a glandular problem.

03:13:52.613 --> 03:13:55.587
MARY: It's the mayonnaise.

03:13:55.587 --> 03:14:07.922
MATT: You hear Gilmore chuckle mid-incantation.
(chanting) "You're ridiculous." (chanting) He

03:14:07.922 --> 03:14:11.566
finishes the incantation, and Gilmore, Vex, and
Vax vanish.

03:14:11.566 --> 03:14:14.901
LIAM: Can't see us, motherfucker!

03:14:14.901 --> 03:14:18.697
TALIESIN: I suppose the invisible people will lead
the way.

03:14:18.697 --> 03:14:23.783
SAM: Let's go!

03:14:23.783 --> 03:14:25.801
WILL: Who knows where they're going?

03:14:25.801 --> 03:14:28.293
LAURA: We do; we all followed Garthok.

03:14:28.293 --> 03:14:31.485
WILL: Okay. Can we see the invisible people?

03:14:31.485 --> 03:14:32.873
MATT: No.

03:14:32.873 --> 03:14:35.137
WILL: Then how the fuck are we going to follow
you?

03:14:35.137 --> 03:14:36.841
TALIESIN: We also know.

03:14:36.841 --> 03:14:42.885
MATT: You guys begin to make your way through, out
of the alley--

03:14:42.885 --> 03:14:45.007
LAURA: I tug on Kash's little braid behind him.

03:14:45.007 --> 03:14:47.524
WILL: Aw, come on! I hate that.

03:14:47.524 --> 03:14:53.692
MATT: You guys make your way into the street, out
of the alleyway. It doesn't take you long to find

03:14:53.692 --> 03:15:03.456
an entrance to the sewer. You do occasionally hear
the distant, ominous (wing flapping) of a wyvern

03:15:03.456 --> 03:15:11.927
rider or two doing a pass over this portion of the
city. A lot of the buildings on the outskirts have

03:15:11.927 --> 03:15:19.102
been damaged even further from last time you were
here. A number of the buildings have doors torn off the

03:15:19.102 --> 03:15:26.650
hinges, signs of struggle on the outside. It takes
you only a couple of minutes before you find a

03:15:26.650 --> 03:15:36.014
grate, a drainage runoff for rain in the city that
leads into a subterranean sewer system. It is a little

03:15:36.014 --> 03:15:41.892
bit out in the open. It's between two buildings,
but right on the cusp of the street itself, so

03:15:41.892 --> 03:15:43.861
you'll have to be quick about it.

03:15:43.861 --> 03:15:46.428
MARY: Let's go.

03:15:46.428 --> 03:15:48.096
WILL: Who's opening it?

03:15:48.096 --> 03:15:49.690
LIAM: I am.

03:15:49.690 --> 03:15:53.137
TALIESIN: Invisible person opens it and then
somebody invisible keeps watch.

03:15:53.137 --> 03:15:54.665
LAURA: I'm keeping watch.

03:15:54.665 --> 03:15:58.236
LIAM: I'm checking for traps, just in case.
Natural 20.

03:15:58.236 --> 03:16:05.576
MATT: That grate is &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; not trapped, like, holy
shit.

03:16:05.576 --> 03:16:09.075
LIAM: It's brand new.

03:16:09.075 --> 03:16:14.438
MATT: No one's ever trapped it, yeah, man. You
could sell that. Like it was day one.

03:16:14.438 --> 03:16:17.150
LIAM: I lick it. There's nothing; it tastes
clean.

03:16:17.150 --> 03:16:18.521
MATT: No, it tastes sweet, actually!

03:16:18.521 --> 03:16:21.985
LIAM: All right. Is it locked?

03:16:21.985 --> 03:16:27.099
MATT: It's not locked. It's wedged a little bit in
there.

03:16:27.099 --> 03:16:30.066
LAURA: Grog, help! Lift!

03:16:30.066 --> 03:16:31.334
WILL: Quietly!

03:16:31.334 --> 03:16:33.359
LAURA: Stealthily.

03:16:33.359 --> 03:16:43.887
MATT: "Okay! Shh!" He walks over and reaches. As
you're down there, he walks over, not seeing

03:16:43.887 --> 03:16:50.076
you, reaches on each side of you to get to the
grate. Are you going to try to get out of the way?

03:16:50.076 --> 03:16:56.804
LIAM: Yeah, I'll roll out of there. It seemed like
you had a little story you wanted to tell. Yeah, I

03:16:56.804 --> 03:16:58.115
roll out of there.

03:16:58.115 --> 03:17:04.766
MATT: You dart out just as he lifts it off. You
hear the creaking of metal, the bars bend slightly as

03:17:04.766 --> 03:17:11.728
the strength imparted by the Titanstone Gauntlets
cause him to easily pry this thing off the ground.

03:17:11.728 --> 03:17:17.975
You can see there is a somewhat eroded ladder, set
of rungs, but it is functional.

03:17:17.975 --> 03:17:19.943
LIAM: How far down, with darkvision?

03:17:19.943 --> 03:17:27.036
MATT: About 20 feet. It seems to open into a
chamber or sewer system.

03:17:27.036 --> 03:17:30.484
LIAM: I spank him on the ass and say: I'm going
in, follow me. I drop in.

03:17:30.484 --> 03:17:35.387
LAURA: Wait, Grog! Put the grate down very
quietly! I whisper in his ear.

03:17:35.387 --> 03:17:40.450
LIAM: On tiptoes. Standing on his knee.

03:17:40.450 --> 03:17:49.282
MATT: You guys all head down there with Pike in
tow, Gilmore following, invisible.

03:17:49.282 --> 03:17:54.253
LAURA: Once we're down in there, I bamf Trinket
out of the necklace.

03:17:54.253 --> 03:18:00.262
MARY: I use Beast Speech. How are you, Trinket?
It's been a long time.

03:18:00.262 --> 03:18:02.674
MATT: "Yes. I'm scared."

03:18:02.674 --> 03:18:05.988
MARY: Don't worry. You know Vex loves you very
much.

03:18:05.988 --> 03:18:07.906
MATT: "It's why I'm here."

03:18:07.906 --> 03:18:11.172
LAURA: I love you very much.

03:18:11.172 --> 03:18:16.666
MARY: We'll look out for you, darling, we will.
Thank you for coming and helping us. Thank you.

03:18:16.666 --> 03:18:18.336
LAURA: And for being such a badass!

03:18:18.336 --> 03:18:21.542
MATT: (grunts) "Smells weird."

03:18:21.542 --> 03:18:27.027
MARY: Kiss him on his--

03:18:27.027 --> 03:18:30.207
MATT: It's cold. It's damp.

03:18:30.207 --> 03:18:32.305
MARY: I love him.

03:18:32.414 --> 03:18:42.676
MATT: You guys continue up the sewer system. It's
been a dry spell for a month, at least. It hasn't

03:18:42.676 --> 03:18:48.786
rained in the past couple of weeks. It rains
fairly often here, so the system itself doesn't

03:18:48.786 --> 03:18:51.986
have a lot of drainage going through. That'll
change soon, I'm sure.

03:18:51.986 --> 03:18:53.884
LIAM: I'm 40 feet ahead the whole time.

03:18:53.884 --> 03:18:56.675
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:18:56.675 --> 03:19:01.421
LIAM: 22.

03:19:01.421 --> 03:19:08.630
MATT: Okay. About ten more minutes into travel,
you're starting to get fairly close to game time,

03:19:08.630 --> 03:19:12.842
when things begin. You do hear some whispers up
ahead.

03:19:12.842 --> 03:19:17.236
LIAM: Hold on. Vex.

03:19:17.236 --> 03:19:21.174
MATT: It sounds like four different voices are all
conversing.

03:19:21.174 --> 03:19:23.177
LAURA: I creep up next to him.

03:19:23.177 --> 03:19:24.727
LIAM: In one location?

03:19:24.727 --> 03:19:29.637
MATT: A little ways ahead, out of sight. You're
not sure of the source; it's echoing from ahead.

03:19:29.637 --> 03:19:31.897
LIAM: Listen with me.

03:19:31.897 --> 03:19:33.231
LAURA: What are they saying?

03:19:33.231 --> 03:19:34.513
MATT: Roll a perception check.

03:19:34.513 --> 03:19:45.467
LAURA: I'm going to roll the Critical Role dice.
Oh man! Oh good, that was good!

03:19:45.467 --> 03:19:51.712
WILL: There was a second where you thought it
wasn't going to be good!

03:19:51.712 --> 03:19:57.356
LAURA: Where's my piece of paper? Perception. That
is a 28.

03:19:57.356 --> 03:20:01.599
MATT: So while you hear the whispers, it's too
distant for you, Vax, to make out the details.

03:20:01.599 --> 03:20:09.557
Vex, as you hone in your ranger attentiveness,
you've studied lip-movement, you've read lips so

03:20:09.557 --> 03:20:13.833
much to the point where any dis-enunciation, you
can fill in the gaps. The conversation sounds

03:20:13.833 --> 03:20:25.124
like, bits are talking about the relocation of
people, timing, "it's too dangerous," "we have to

03:20:25.124 --> 03:20:32.784
"move further west," "the tunnels are down," "now
now now," and you hear a bunch of footfalls.

03:20:32.784 --> 03:20:35.440
LAURA: Running away from us?

03:20:35.440 --> 03:20:40.007
MATT: Running in a direction, you can't make out
if it's towards or away, right now in this moment.

03:20:40.007 --> 03:20:43.348
LIAM: Do we pop out now and talk to them?

03:20:43.348 --> 03:20:50.052
MATT: You now see what looks to be seven figures
step into the center of the walkway where you are,

03:20:50.052 --> 03:20:52.444
walking away from you, in the direction you were
traveling.

03:20:52.444 --> 03:20:54.598
WILL: Is anybody still invisible and/or lizards?

03:20:54.598 --> 03:20:57.102
MATT: You are all still lizards and three of you
are invisible.

03:20:57.102 --> 03:20:59.089
LAURA: And they're heading towards us?

03:20:59.089 --> 03:21:01.242
MATT: They're heading away from you, in the
direction you were going.

03:21:01.242 --> 03:21:02.459
LAURA: Okay.

03:21:02.459 --> 03:21:04.327
LIAM: Wait if I go?

03:21:04.327 --> 03:21:06.314
LAURA: They hate you.

03:21:06.387 --> 03:21:08.041
LIAM: Wait.

03:21:08.041 --> 03:21:15.565
MATT: Three of them stop and turn, "Wait, shh!"
It's really quiet, they've all just stopped.

03:21:15.565 --> 03:21:22.198
LAURA: Are you true to Emon?

03:21:22.198 --> 03:21:28.920
MATT: Stillness, no movement. One of them goes and
pulls a blade out very quietly.

03:21:28.920 --> 03:21:37.384
LIAM: I used to be one of you. I used to be
Clasp.

03:21:37.384 --> 03:21:39.173
LAURA: And then I took an arrow to the knee.

03:21:39.173 --> 03:21:45.247
(laughter)

03:21:45.247 --> 03:21:47.716
TALIESIN: That may be the funniest that's ever
been.

03:21:47.716 --> 03:21:51.986
LIAM: So fucking meta.

03:21:51.986 --> 03:21:54.199
(laughter)

03:21:54.199 --> 03:21:55.914
TALIESIN: Joke has been waiting for years.

03:21:55.914 --> 03:21:58.113
MARISHA: Yeah, what's up, 2014!

03:21:58.113 --> 03:21:59.818
LAURA: Remastered!

03:21:59.818 --> 03:22:01.447
MATT: You made it funny again!

03:22:01.447 --> 03:22:05.166
LIAM: She's in the game.

03:22:05.166 --> 03:22:08.017
SAM: Are you invisible?

03:22:08.017 --> 03:22:09.674
LAURA: Yeah, we're still invisible.

03:22:09.674 --> 03:22:14.007
TALIESIN: We're friends of Garthak.

03:22:14.007 --> 03:22:15.276
LAURA: Garthok?

03:22:15.276 --> 03:22:16.636
TALIESIN: Garthok.

03:22:16.636 --> 03:22:21.517
LAURA: You're invisible, and you're far back.

03:22:21.517 --> 03:22:27.476
MATT: Also, all the figures that were stopped are
slowly crawling in your direction. And one of them

03:22:27.476 --> 03:22:32.357
goes, "It's lizardmen. Turn away."

03:22:32.357 --> 03:22:36.256
LAURA: It's not lizardmen. Magic.

03:22:36.256 --> 03:22:38.511
LIAM: It's a ruse.

03:22:38.511 --> 03:22:43.660
MATT: Make a persuasion check, with disadvantage.

03:22:43.660 --> 03:22:44.825
LAURA: Oh no!

03:22:44.825 --> 03:22:49.687
MATT: Because you're two voices coming out of the
ether right now! They just see a cluster of

03:22:49.687 --> 03:22:52.281
lizards in the shadows and voices going, "No,
we're okay!"

03:22:52.281 --> 03:22:53.865
(laughter)

03:22:53.865 --> 03:22:55.273
WILL: "We're not lizards!"

03:22:55.273 --> 03:22:56.783
MATT: "Don't worry, guys!"

03:22:56.783 --> 03:23:00.683
LAURA: I rolled a 20, and a one.

03:23:00.683 --> 03:23:02.449
MARISHA: Shut up.

03:23:02.449 --> 03:23:03.997
LIAM: Also one.

03:23:03.997 --> 03:23:06.622
MARISHA: You also rolled a one?! You both rolled
fucking ones?

03:23:06.622 --> 03:23:09.887
LIAM: "Cacaw, look over here!"

03:23:09.887 --> 03:23:19.726
MATT: The one in the front goes, "Shit! We have to
close it! Run, run!" And all seven just start

03:23:19.726 --> 03:23:22.100
running in the direction they were going.

03:23:22.100 --> 03:23:23.903
LAURA: Oh, fuck, what do we do? Somebody--

03:23:23.903 --> 03:23:25.463
MARY: I go running up! Wait!

03:23:25.463 --> 03:23:29.149
LAURA: Drop Seeming, drop Seeming! Drop Seeming,
Scanlan!

03:23:29.149 --> 03:23:30.861
LIAM: I'm running after them.

03:23:30.861 --> 03:23:33.171
SAM: Okay, okay! I'm dropping Seeming.

03:23:33.171 --> 03:23:34.461
MATT: Okay.

03:23:34.461 --> 03:23:36.070
LAURA: Please, wait! We're not lizardmen.

03:23:36.070 --> 03:23:37.671
SAM: You're still invisible.

03:23:37.671 --> 03:23:40.170
WILL: We're not lizardmen!

03:23:40.170 --> 03:23:45.315
MARY: Please, wait! Please, do not be afraid. We
are with you.

03:23:45.315 --> 03:23:47.861
SAM: Oh, sorry, you're freaky-looking, so--

03:23:47.861 --> 03:23:49.681
(laughter)

03:23:49.681 --> 03:23:52.970
MARY: I understand that! I'm not a lizard person,
and I have a very high persuasion!

03:23:52.970 --> 03:24:01.616
MATT: You do. Double ones is a rough situation.
They have bolted very quickly, and they are not

03:24:01.616 --> 03:24:05.724
showing any sign of slowing, and you just hear the
footprints go (stepping sounds).

03:24:05.724 --> 03:24:06.940
LAURA and MARY: Shit.

03:24:06.940 --> 03:24:07.923
MARISHA: Move fast.

03:24:07.923 --> 03:24:09.573
WILL: We can't catch them?

03:24:09.573 --> 03:24:13.803
MATT: Well, you're keeping in pace. So, if you
guys full bore, double dashing--

03:24:13.803 --> 03:24:15.556
MARY: How far away are they?

03:24:15.556 --> 03:24:19.307
MATT: They're beyond your visual sight right now
in the darkness.

03:24:19.307 --> 03:24:21.490
MARY: Are they more than 30 feet?

03:24:21.490 --> 03:24:22.629
MATT: Yes, they are.

03:24:22.629 --> 03:24:27.630
LIAM: I shout out after them, I know Garthok,
he'll recognize me!

03:24:27.630 --> 03:24:30.521
MARISHA: He also kind of hates us, I think.

03:24:30.521 --> 03:24:31.810
LIAM: Don't care.

03:24:31.810 --> 03:24:38.253
MATT: The, mm... Double one, man.

03:24:38.253 --> 03:24:41.061
LIAM: Okay. Okay.

03:24:41.061 --> 03:24:43.772
MATT: Yeah. No, they're still running. They're
still running.

03:24:43.772 --> 03:24:45.263
LAURA: We're still running after them.

03:24:45.263 --> 03:24:53.715
MATT: Okay. You guys follow them for the next ten
minutes or so, and you're roughly ten minutes from

03:24:53.715 --> 03:24:59.504
sundown, game time, before you hear a door slam
ahead of you.

03:24:59.504 --> 03:25:01.627
LIAM: I want to move to that door.

03:25:01.627 --> 03:25:07.563
MARISHA: I immediately stop and start looking
behind me. Does this look like we just ran into a trap?

03:25:07.563 --> 03:25:13.137
MATT: Make a perception check. Well, this would be
more of an investigation.

03:25:13.137 --> 03:25:15.321
LIAM: Are they catching up behind?

03:25:15.321 --> 03:25:16.284
MATT: Yeah.

03:25:16.284 --> 03:25:17.436
MARISHA: Okay. 21 total.

03:25:17.436 --> 03:25:18.656
LIAM: I'm checking the door, too.

03:25:18.656 --> 03:25:26.184
MATT: Okay. Looking around, it's hard to see. The
sewer has slowly given way to a non-sewage tunnel

03:25:26.184 --> 03:25:34.132
system that looks like it has existed for a long
time. This is reminiscent of some elements of the

03:25:34.132 --> 03:25:38.267
Clasp's tunnel system that you've seen before,
though you haven't really been to it this far

03:25:38.267 --> 03:25:39.429
south in the city.

03:25:39.429 --> 03:25:44.534
MARISHA: Okay. I stand back before I run in with
the rest of them. I don't want to get us all in a

03:25:44.534 --> 03:25:45.655
corridor.

03:25:45.655 --> 03:25:47.427
MARY: Can we investigate the door?

03:25:47.427 --> 03:25:49.081
LIAM: I rolled a 28.

03:25:49.081 --> 03:25:51.593
MATT: He's currently doing that right now. You
rolled a 20?

03:25:51.593 --> 03:25:53.200
LAURA: I like that you're talking to Matt through
the earring.

03:25:53.200 --> 03:25:54.579
LIAM: I'm not talking to Matt, I'm--

03:25:54.579 --> 03:25:56.075
(laughter)

03:25:56.075 --> 03:26:02.696
LIAM: Laura Bailey, busting my balls since 2000
and something, every chance she gets. But she

03:26:02.696 --> 03:26:05.274
"loves me with all her heart!"

03:26:05.274 --> 03:26:07.317
(laughter)

03:26:07.317 --> 03:26:13.536
LIAM: Don't touch me! 28! Support you left and
right, and this is the thanks I get?

03:26:13.536 --> 03:26:17.125
MATT: The door is locked, and the door is
trapped.

03:26:17.125 --> 03:26:25.281
LIAM: Scanlan. Will you come up here, please? I've
got my hand on my earlobe for a fucking reason.

03:26:25.281 --> 03:26:27.657
SAM: I'm here, what do you need?

03:26:27.657 --> 03:26:30.198
LIAM: I need you to talk us into this fucking
doorway.

03:26:30.198 --> 03:26:35.278
SAM: For what, are we still trying to get this
Clasp? Ten minutes has gone by. All right, great.

03:26:35.278 --> 03:26:37.830
LIAM: Talk to the fuckers on the other side of
this door. You can talk to anybody.

03:26:37.830 --> 03:26:44.489
SAM: I knock, knock, knock on the door. And I say,
oi, I know you can hear me in there. Sorry for the

03:26:44.489 --> 03:26:50.092
scare. We're friends, and we're here to help you
get a lot of gold.

03:26:50.092 --> 03:26:56.236
MATT: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage.

03:26:56.236 --> 03:26:58.495
SAM: Because it's through a door.

03:26:58.495 --> 03:26:59.885
MATT: And because they--

03:26:59.885 --> 03:27:02.231
MARISHA: Because we're assholes.

03:27:02.231 --> 03:27:05.053
TALIESIN: You should try and sell them drugs. I
think that would go well.

03:27:05.053 --> 03:27:06.505
LAURA: Oh, sell them drugs!

03:27:06.505 --> 03:27:08.051
SAM: 28.

03:27:08.051 --> 03:27:12.013
MATT: I can guarantee you, they don't have any.

03:27:12.013 --> 03:27:14.409
TALIESIN: No, he's got them, he can sell them
off.

03:27:14.409 --> 03:27:16.388
MATT: They're the Clasp.

03:27:16.388 --> 03:27:17.810
LIAM: They're straight-edge, I know.

03:27:17.810 --> 03:27:19.416
MATT: Oh, totally.

03:27:19.416 --> 03:27:22.251
WILL: You still don't know if you put it up your
ass or smoke it. How are you gonna sell it?

03:27:22.251 --> 03:27:23.803
SAM: I'll find out from them.

03:27:23.803 --> 03:27:37.710
MATT: There's a pause, and then a voice comes
through and says, "So. Who are you? What do you

03:27:37.710 --> 03:27:43.342
"want? What leaves you the possibility of wandering
these sewers unstabbed?"

03:27:43.342 --> 03:27:53.858
SAM: First of all, you, or members of your
organization, know us. We are from Emon. We are

03:27:53.858 --> 03:28:08.697
Emonites. Emonies? We're locals. We've traveled
these sewers before, among you. And we will again

03:28:08.697 --> 03:28:17.290
tonight if you help us find our way to Thordak. We
are super-powerful superheroes who are gonna kill

03:28:17.290 --> 03:28:19.564
a dragon and give you half the gold.

03:28:19.564 --> 03:28:24.509
LAURA: Half the gold? &lt;i&gt;Half&lt;/i&gt; the gold? Holy.

03:28:24.509 --> 03:28:40.464
MATT: There's another pause. Ten, 20 seconds. 30
seconds. Then you hear a winch go (clacking, tink).

03:28:40.464 --> 03:28:54.771
Then you hear (door opening sound) and the
door just ever faintly opens, and just a single

03:28:54.771 --> 03:29:04.131
face pokes through, hood up. "So. You're allies
against the dragon?"

03:29:04.131 --> 03:29:05.994
TALIESIN: Absolutely.

03:29:05.994 --> 03:29:09.841
MATT: "How many are you?"

03:29:09.841 --> 03:29:13.697
SAM: Well--

03:29:13.697 --> 03:29:16.137
(laughter)

03:29:16.137 --> 03:29:17.932
SAM: About a half dozen, let's say.

03:29:17.932 --> 03:29:19.243
TALIESIN: Twice a half a dozen.

03:29:19.243 --> 03:29:20.569
LAURA: I think 12-ish?

03:29:20.569 --> 03:29:31.089
SAM: Ten, ten? Some are animals, some are
invisible. Six to 12.

03:29:31.089 --> 03:29:38.911
MATT: "We stand 30 strong in this room, crossbows
drawn. Make no mistakes, we will be watching you.

03:29:38.911 --> 03:29:44.752
"One false move, you'll all have a bolt in the back
of the skull. Walk with us, we'll see if what you

03:29:44.752 --> 03:29:45.907
"say is true."

03:29:45.907 --> 03:29:51.933
LIAM: I use Thieves' Cant to knock out the phrase,
"No bullshit," on the door.

03:29:51.933 --> 03:29:56.663
MATT: You see his chin move and grind for a
moment.

03:29:56.663 --> 03:29:59.064
SAM: I did that with my penis.

03:29:59.064 --> 03:30:06.611
(laughter)

03:30:06.611 --> 03:30:08.387
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:30:08.387 --> 03:30:10.988
(laughter)

03:30:10.988 --> 03:30:12.488
MARY: He thinks you're cute.

03:30:12.488 --> 03:30:13.444
SAM: 20.

03:30:13.444 --> 03:30:14.339
MATT: 20?

03:30:14.339 --> 03:30:16.097
LAURA: I like that he goes-- and it's a 20.

03:30:16.097 --> 03:30:24.219
MATT: Yeah. (laughs) You see him go-- and slowly
back away. The door opens wider, and as you enter

03:30:24.219 --> 03:30:31.924
the room, you can see there's roughly 30 people in
various dark bits of dress. The Clasp had a uniform,

03:30:31.924 --> 03:30:38.628
or at least a uniform style to them, when they were
within their safe space. While that still exists, all

03:30:38.628 --> 03:30:48.400
of them look tattered. They look underfed. They
look sleepless. And they all look driven. And it's

03:30:48.400 --> 03:30:55.735
that cornered animal look that both is welcoming
and also a little scary. And as you all walk in,

03:30:55.735 --> 03:30:59.718
they all very intently keep their eyes on you,
their crossbows at their side. They're all

03:30:59.718 --> 03:31:05.616
surveying you and taking in and-- You can
definitely see them accepting that you are

03:31:05.616 --> 03:31:11.457
powerful in comparison to maybe many of the others
that they've encountered. And that also scares

03:31:11.457 --> 03:31:16.971
them. It would be like, 'Good. Fuck,' at the same
time. And as you all walk in, in this sullen

03:31:16.971 --> 03:31:25.607
atmosphere, the one that was talking to you pulls
his hood back, and you see it's a younger man,

03:31:25.607 --> 03:31:34.582
probably in his late 20s, but his face is just
currently wrecked by some sort of a disease that's

03:31:34.582 --> 03:31:36.270
just scarred over.

03:31:36.270 --> 03:31:38.740
LIAM: Where is Shenn?

03:31:38.740 --> 03:31:42.415
MATT: "You want us to take you to Shenn?"

03:31:42.415 --> 03:31:43.759
LAURA: No.

03:31:43.759 --> 03:31:45.544
TALIESIN: There's no time, to be honest.

03:31:45.544 --> 03:31:46.866
LIAM: Where is he?

03:31:46.866 --> 03:31:53.889
MATT: (sighs) "He's probably by the volcanic
pocket. Looks to me-- at least from the word on

03:31:53.889 --> 03:31:57.142
"the street-- there's something going on.
Something's going to be happening tonight, and the

03:31:57.142 --> 03:32:00.102
"Clasp is getting ready."

03:32:00.102 --> 03:32:03.338
WILL: Yeah, we've got about ten minutes until
all hell breaks loose. So if we've got to do this,

03:32:03.338 --> 03:32:05.047
we've got to do this now.

03:32:05.047 --> 03:32:07.333
LAURA: We've got to get to where Thordak is.

03:32:07.333 --> 03:32:10.295
MARY: Is he by this volcanic surge?

03:32:10.295 --> 03:32:16.995
MATT: "That he is. (sighs) Travel fast. Travel
light. Follow me." Puts his hood back up, and goes

03:32:16.995 --> 03:32:18.297
into a run.

03:32:18.297 --> 03:32:20.655
WILL: Go running.

03:32:20.655 --> 03:32:22.089
MARY: Naruto.

03:32:22.089 --> 03:32:29.975
MATT: You guys all gave chase, at this point, as
fast as you can. Poor Pike is like (panting).

03:32:29.975 --> 03:32:31.956
LAURA: Grog picks her up, come on!

03:32:31.956 --> 03:32:37.934
MATT: Grog picks her up, as he does. And she's
still like, running in the air before, "Whoa!

03:32:37.934 --> 03:32:43.198
"Okay. Thanks." And puts her on his shoulders, and
they're running together. Pike has to duck low a

03:32:43.198 --> 03:32:47.649
couple of times as she almost gets her head
knocked off on the low bridge area. Following him

03:32:47.649 --> 03:32:53.759
as fast you can, it's around the corner, down low
corners. He's quick. And you can see why certain

03:32:53.759 --> 03:32:58.345
people within the Clasp rise quickly, in that
messenger format, is they can get around the city

03:32:58.345 --> 03:33:10.826
like that. You begin to get to a point where you
see a few grates up above you, passing 20 feet

03:33:10.826 --> 03:33:18.340
up. You start to see more and more sewer openings.
And you hear in the distance the sound of cracking

03:33:18.340 --> 03:33:19.606
thunder.

03:33:19.606 --> 03:33:22.022
MARY: (whispers) The storm's coming.

03:33:22.022 --> 03:33:25.164
SAM: As soon as we get out, Keyleth, you have to
make a storm or something--

03:33:25.164 --> 03:33:26.103
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:33:26.103 --> 03:33:27.936
SAM: Or a VM or something, right?

03:33:27.936 --> 03:33:29.599
LAURA: She can probably do it through the
grates.

03:33:29.599 --> 03:33:31.780
SAM: Okay. Hurricane.

03:33:31.780 --> 03:33:41.793
MATT: As you continue to run, you can hear up
above, too, what sounds like just the energy

03:33:41.793 --> 03:33:50.291
itself is gathering into a loud cacophony of
screeches and roars. It sounds like the populace

03:33:50.291 --> 03:34:00.711
that is keeping guard over the currently ruled,
tyrannically held city, the wyverns are restless.

03:34:00.711 --> 03:34:05.902
They see something happening, there's something
brewing. And now, not just those below understand,

03:34:05.902 --> 03:34:14.443
but those above are starting to get the sense that
things are not right. It's beginning. You begin to

03:34:14.443 --> 03:34:21.283
feel and hear bits of rainfall beginning to come
through the grates, just up ahead. The little bit

03:34:21.283 --> 03:34:27.440
of light that peeks through, you can see the
droplets now hitting as you run past, overhead.

03:34:27.440 --> 03:34:38.394
You hear another bolt of lightning and thunder in
the distance. And another (lightning crack). The

03:34:38.394 --> 03:34:46.826
storm is getting faster and more successive and
it's definitely landed in Emon. You continue to

03:34:46.826 --> 03:34:48.166
push forward--

03:34:48.166 --> 03:34:50.088
MARY: How far are we?

03:34:50.088 --> 03:34:52.440
MATT: You shouting ahead of--?

03:34:52.440 --> 03:34:53.819
MARY: How much longer?

03:34:53.819 --> 03:34:55.394
MATT: "You feel that?"

03:34:55.394 --> 03:34:56.621
MARY: Yes.

03:34:56.621 --> 03:35:01.603
MATT: "No. Do you feel &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;?" And you start to
realize, as cold as it is up there, as it has been

03:35:01.603 --> 03:35:07.882
in the past, these tunnels are growing warmer, and
warmer, and warmer. "We're not far now." And he's

03:35:07.882 --> 03:35:09.145
still running.

03:35:09.145 --> 03:35:11.855
LAURA: As I'm running, I'm dipping arrows in
poison.

03:35:11.855 --> 03:35:13.200
MATT: Okay.

03:35:13.200 --> 03:35:14.442
LAURA: I've got six.

03:35:14.442 --> 03:35:16.855
MATT: Okay. So go ahead and mark those--

03:35:16.855 --> 03:35:18.820
LAURA: Six vials of poison. So that makes six
arrows or does that make--?

03:35:18.820 --> 03:35:22.035
MATT: Each vial can make three poisoned arrows.

03:35:22.035 --> 03:35:25.179
LAURA: Three? However many I can make during this
amount of time. Because I know it only lasts

03:35:25.179 --> 03:35:27.513
for an hour. So on the tips.

03:35:27.513 --> 03:35:29.067
MATT: So per vial is three hours.

03:35:29.067 --> 03:35:30.147
LAURA: Awesome!

03:35:30.147 --> 03:35:40.332
MATT: It's hard to do while running at this fast pace,
so I'd say you could get maybe two vials done, to be

03:35:40.332 --> 03:35:43.800
honest. Because in order to keep up, it's a full
sprint. You're racing against time for this. It's

03:35:43.800 --> 03:35:45.871
like, running as hard as you can, and like--

03:35:45.871 --> 03:35:50.986
(laughter)

03:35:50.986 --> 03:35:53.185
MATT: It's a little hard.

03:35:53.185 --> 03:35:55.480
LAURA: It's one of those things I meant to do
earlier.

03:35:55.480 --> 03:36:02.341
SAM: Just got to finish knitting this sweater.

03:36:02.341 --> 03:36:06.081
(laughter)

03:36:06.081 --> 03:36:16.285
MATT: Eventually, you begin watching as these
tunnels, you see collapsed portions of it. You see

03:36:16.285 --> 03:36:23.890
the falling rocks that are gathered. You feel the
air itself become humid, become temperate and

03:36:23.890 --> 03:36:30.889
uncomfortably warm. The sweat begins to drip down
your brow, and what you recall being the dry heat

03:36:30.889 --> 03:36:37.431
of the Marquet deserts is now being matched or
exceeded by the wet, damp, humid underground air

03:36:37.431 --> 03:36:43.485
of the subterranean tunnels of Emon. You dart
around the corner and follow him around this

03:36:43.485 --> 03:36:52.528
curve, and it's the first time you see a break in
the rock, where a vibrant, bright orange stream of

03:36:52.528 --> 03:37:00.491
molten rock is now pouring down, past into some
basin below the walkway. And you see him more

03:37:00.491 --> 03:37:08.786
carefully walk around it. And now this pathway has
gone from an original Clasp tunnel to,

03:37:08.786 --> 03:37:17.024
essentially, a haphazardly carved or left over and
barely functional tunnel that has been wrecked by

03:37:17.024 --> 03:37:26.222
this slow incursion of volcanic activity. You have
about two more minutes of running before he comes

03:37:26.222 --> 03:37:35.605
to a stop. And you hear now, what initially was
just the rousing of local lizard creatures and

03:37:35.605 --> 03:37:50.886
denizens of Emon, the now-ruling class, the
lightning is every few seconds. And you hear one

03:37:50.886 --> 03:38:06.743
loud, ominous, rumbling roar echo through the sky.
And it's a familiar roar. You heard it once,

03:38:06.743 --> 03:38:12.333
before the fall of Emon. The storm has awakened,
or at least got the attention of the beast, the

03:38:12.333 --> 03:38:19.109
tyrant that now resides over the city of Emon.
And he is not that far from where you stand. The

03:38:19.109 --> 03:38:24.089
young man pulls his hood back again and points up,
and you can see that there's one tunnel that leads

03:38:24.089 --> 03:38:30.391
up out of the sewer. Part of it is jutting
outward, and it's a slippery pouring of rain now

03:38:30.391 --> 03:38:37.899
just gliding off of it and slopping into mud on the
ground. Most of the rungs have been rent off or

03:38:37.899 --> 03:38:44.898
fallen through the erosion, or the impression of
this tectonic shift in this localized area. He

03:38:44.898 --> 03:38:46.044
points up.

03:38:46.044 --> 03:38:52.388
"This is the closest I can get you but I don't
know how you want to climb. Good luck."

03:38:52.388 --> 03:38:58.179
And he turns around and darts back where you guys
came from.

03:38:58.179 --> 03:39:01.879
MARY: So he's guiding us up and out?

03:39:01.879 --> 03:39:03.732
MATT: No, he's gone.

03:39:03.732 --> 03:39:06.997
SAM: We've got to get up. So wait, there's a pipe
to climb up?

03:39:06.997 --> 03:39:14.526
MATT: It's a three-, four-foot-wide tunnel. It
used to go straight up, but now parts of it are

03:39:14.526 --> 03:39:20.029
(ground cracks). It's a little crooked and some of
the initial climbing rungs have eroded away.

03:39:20.029 --> 03:39:21.678
LAURA: Can we parkour up?

03:39:21.678 --> 03:39:24.478
MATT: Certainly. Go ahead and make acrobatics
checks, both of you guys.

03:39:24.478 --> 03:39:26.314
MARY: Can Grog throw us up?

03:39:26.314 --> 03:39:29.401
MARISHA: Is there a grate ahead of us? Can I
see the sky?

03:39:29.401 --> 03:39:32.883
MATT: There is, but it doesn't-- it looks
partially off.

03:39:32.883 --> 03:39:34.064
LIAM: 33.

03:39:34.064 --> 03:39:36.584
LAURA: 34.

03:39:36.584 --> 03:39:47.079
MATT: Both of you guys, in a networked-twin-type
near-ballet in its execution, darting up in

03:39:47.079 --> 03:39:53.791
tandem, both using each other to push off as you
hit each edge, you make your way to the very top

03:39:53.791 --> 03:39:59.072
in this crisscross fashion, then one of you gets
up just in time to hit the grate as the other one

03:39:59.072 --> 03:40:03.205
hits the other side, sending it onto the ground
outside.

03:40:03.205 --> 03:40:05.511
LIAM: Perception check. For anything nearby.

03:40:05.511 --> 03:40:08.782
LAURA: By the way, I was totally going to say I
was putting Trinket back in the necklace before

03:40:08.782 --> 03:40:11.717
you started saying all that, I was just-- It went
into it right away.

03:40:11.717 --> 03:40:14.344
MATT: Okay. Not a worry. Trinket is in the
necklace.

03:40:14.344 --> 03:40:15.852
LIAM: 29.

03:40:15.852 --> 03:40:19.809
LAURA: Oh, I want to perception check too. Just
because, you know, that 29 isn't going to see

03:40:19.809 --> 03:40:21.010
everything.

03:40:21.010 --> 03:40:22.855
LIAM: No, you've got to get 30, right?

03:40:22.855 --> 03:40:24.360
LAURA: Yeah. No, this is a 23. So--

03:40:24.360 --> 03:40:26.509
(laughter)

03:40:26.509 --> 03:40:32.951
MATT: You guys both look out. You, Vex, looking
around you, you can see you are in the street. And

03:40:32.951 --> 03:40:38.353
you can see there are a number of buildings
around: single-story, second-story, some of them

03:40:38.353 --> 03:40:45.139
long-collapsed and burned. Some still have flames
on them that the rain is attempting to put out,

03:40:45.139 --> 03:40:54.653
but the fire is fighting back. You, Vax, see the
same spread, and off to the left of you, a

03:40:54.653 --> 03:41:01.431
familiar sight. The Cloudtop District wall and
gates, maybe a couple hundred feet off from

03:41:01.431 --> 03:41:09.522
your current position. You can see beyond that
just a singular, black column of smoke, with the

03:41:09.522 --> 03:41:15.149
occasional flicker of red embers just drifting up
through, fighting against the storm itself. The

03:41:15.149 --> 03:41:21.037
rain may fall, but it doesn't seem to last long
enough to hit the ground of the Cloudtop. You see

03:41:21.037 --> 03:41:28.053
mist and steam begin to rise up; the rain is
evaporating before it can even get close. You also

03:41:28.053 --> 03:41:34.117
see above the gate what looks to be a few dozen
small, dark shapes. You take a moment to focus

03:41:34.117 --> 03:41:39.051
before you can see what looks to be-- what were
once people are now blackened husks that have been

03:41:39.051 --> 03:41:44.543
left up on chains; decoration, if you will, for
the outside of the Cloudtop. It's a warning, or a

03:41:44.543 --> 03:41:53.028
celebration of Thordak's rule. You see, on the
outside of that gate, two large, armored, alert

03:41:53.028 --> 03:41:58.810
fire giants, wielding long, thick, square, black
metal blades that themselves have flames

03:41:58.810 --> 03:42:04.345
engulfing. And they are both standing there, just
shoulder to shoulder, looking about, on high alert

03:42:04.345 --> 03:42:06.439
based on the current chaos of the circumstance.

03:42:06.439 --> 03:42:09.101
LIAM: What's between us and them?

03:42:09.101 --> 03:42:14.439
MATT: It's road. It's just bare road. You have
buildings to each side, you're just now emerging

03:42:14.439 --> 03:42:18.774
from the alleyway, and you are in the center of
the street right now.

03:42:18.774 --> 03:42:20.087
LIAM: How far are they from us right now?

03:42:20.087 --> 03:42:21.551
MATT: They're a little over a hundred feet.

03:42:21.551 --> 03:42:23.162
SAM: Two fire giants?

03:42:23.162 --> 03:42:24.313
LAURA: Yeah.

03:42:24.313 --> 03:42:27.492
LIAM: I pull Vex out of view--

03:42:27.492 --> 03:42:29.098
LAURA: I mean, we're invisible.

03:42:29.098 --> 03:42:37.089
LIAM: I know, I don't want to be heard. We've got 
two fucking giants up here, guarding our path--

03:42:37.089 --> 03:42:39.925
LAURA: About a hundred feet off, clear view.

03:42:39.925 --> 03:42:42.909
SAM: There's no more tunnel down here, right?

03:42:42.909 --> 03:42:49.270
MATT: No, it goes for another five or six feet,
and then it is just wrecked, it's collapsed,

03:42:49.270 --> 03:42:50.358
ruined--

03:42:50.358 --> 03:42:55.028
SAM: We cannot spend our energy fighting these
guys. We have to distract them away and move in

03:42:55.028 --> 03:42:56.524
past their position.

03:42:56.524 --> 03:43:00.986
MARISHA: I can conjure an elemental. Will it--?

03:43:00.986 --> 03:43:03.187
SAM: And one of them will chase it.

03:43:03.187 --> 03:43:05.904
LAURA: Is it possible to get up and over the wall,
away from them?

03:43:05.904 --> 03:43:09.750
LIAM: Three of us are invisible, but not the rest.
How do we get by?

03:43:09.750 --> 03:43:11.594
SAM: Is there a gate behind the line?

03:43:11.594 --> 03:43:12.830
WILL: Can we hear this conversation?

03:43:12.830 --> 03:43:15.065
SAM: You can hear half of it.

03:43:15.065 --> 03:43:21.143
TALIESIN: Two fire giants guarding the gates. We
have to get rid of them.

03:43:21.143 --> 03:43:23.416
WILL: Can we get into a building on the other
side?

03:43:23.416 --> 03:43:27.065
TALIESIN: It's just a wall, it's defensive. We can
get over the wall, perhaps.

03:43:27.065 --> 03:43:28.569
MARISHA: What kind of wall is it?

03:43:28.569 --> 03:43:30.298
SAM: 30 feet high?

03:43:30.298 --> 03:43:33.802
MATT: It is about roughly 30, 35 feet.

03:43:33.802 --> 03:43:35.540
LAURA: Can I peek my head out--?

03:43:35.540 --> 03:43:42.942
MATT: Oh! It is a solid, thick, stone wall. It is
designed as a second-tier defense from siege

03:43:42.942 --> 03:43:46.396
warfare against the palace and the--

03:43:46.396 --> 03:43:49.730
MARISHA: Can I use Stoneshape to stoneshape us a
hole through it?

03:43:49.730 --> 03:43:54.292
MATT: You know that it's pretty thick. You're
familiar with the wall. You guys have traveled to

03:43:54.292 --> 03:43:59.003
and from the Cloudtop before. Let me see, where's
Stoneshape--

03:43:59.003 --> 03:44:01.198
LIAM: Extend the tunnel?

03:44:01.198 --> 03:44:04.262
LAURA: Or I can fly up to the top of the wall and
drop the rope down?

03:44:04.262 --> 03:44:09.178
MARISHA: The problem is, I don't know how far the
tunnel has collapsed.

03:44:09.178 --> 03:44:10.357
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:44:10.357 --> 03:44:12.883
MATT: No more than five feet in any dimension. No,
it's thicker than that.

03:44:12.883 --> 03:44:15.405
MARY: Where do you need to go beyond this?

03:44:15.405 --> 03:44:16.897
SAM: In there.

03:44:16.897 --> 03:44:26.563
MARISHA: I took-- Okay, here's the thing: I took
Move Earth. I can try and tunnel us through. But

03:44:26.563 --> 03:44:27.933
that's a pretty big spell.

03:44:27.933 --> 03:44:28.997
LAURA: Well, what if--

03:44:28.997 --> 03:44:30.241
MATT: Move Earth also takes a while.

03:44:30.241 --> 03:44:37.617
LAURA: What if I come out, I fly, I move down away
from the fire giants, I fly up to the top of the

03:44:37.617 --> 03:44:40.792
wall and drop the rope down? So everybody can
climb up?

03:44:40.792 --> 03:44:43.439
LIAM: But nobody's invisible but ourselves.

03:44:43.439 --> 03:44:45.841
WILL: It's too much of a chance, they're going to
see you.

03:44:45.841 --> 03:44:47.942
MARY: They're going to see you. How far away are
we from them?

03:44:47.942 --> 03:44:49.618
MATT: You're about a hundred feet.

03:44:49.618 --> 03:44:52.631
SAM: I can make another three of us invisible. But
that's still not enough.

03:44:52.631 --> 03:44:54.949
MARISHA: Do fire giants have any reason to attack
lizard people?

03:44:54.949 --> 03:44:57.918
MATT: You don't know.

03:44:57.918 --> 03:45:00.545
LAURA: Maybe make lizard people and then pop
over--

03:45:00.545 --> 03:45:05.564
SAM: I've just burned a 5th-level spell making us
lizard people once for no fucking reason.

03:45:05.564 --> 03:45:08.454
LIAM: And that's dropped at this point?

03:45:08.454 --> 03:45:09.518
SAM: Yeah.

03:45:09.518 --> 03:45:13.359
MARY: You need a distraction.

03:45:13.359 --> 03:45:15.054
SAM: We definitely do.

03:45:15.054 --> 03:45:16.582
MARY: Let us do this.

03:45:16.582 --> 03:45:18.064
SAM: You two?

03:45:18.064 --> 03:45:19.100
WILL: Two of us have to stay.

03:45:19.100 --> 03:45:19.977
MARY: Let us do this.

03:45:19.977 --> 03:45:21.064
LAURA: What?!

03:45:21.064 --> 03:45:22.864
MARY: Let. Us. Do. This.

03:45:22.864 --> 03:45:24.450
WILL: We don't have any time.

03:45:24.450 --> 03:45:29.332
MARISHA: We need you guys. We need-- we need you.

03:45:29.332 --> 03:45:30.916
MARY: You can do this without us.

03:45:30.916 --> 03:45:32.606
SAM: Are you going to go out and draw them away?

03:45:32.606 --> 03:45:38.885
MARY: We'll try and meet you if we can. In the
meantime, call your people. Do it now.

03:45:38.885 --> 03:45:41.603
SAM: Absolutely.

03:45:41.603 --> 03:45:51.886
MARY: I cast-- I invoke-- I use a cantrip Mask of
Many Faces. As a lizard person, I go ten feet so

03:45:51.886 --> 03:45:58.794
I'm within 90 feet, and I cast Evard's Black
Tentacles on the two fire giants.

03:45:58.794 --> 03:46:00.823
TALIESIN: You've got to go out the tunnel first.

03:46:00.823 --> 03:46:08.985
MARISHA: I grab Kash by the arm really fast, and I
just say, thank you. And I give him a kiss on the cheek.

03:46:08.985 --> 03:46:12.137
WILL: We're way past that.

03:46:12.137 --> 03:46:14.836
MARISHA: Just shut up and appreciate it! Go!

03:46:14.836 --> 03:46:25.904
MARY: Before I go running out, I grab Vex. I love
you, if I can find you, I will. If not, stay alive.

03:46:25.904 --> 03:46:27.556
WILL: I grab Vax real quick. Hey!

03:46:27.556 --> 03:46:28.420
LIAM: Yeah?

03:46:28.420 --> 03:46:29.381
WILL: Two things.

03:46:29.381 --> 03:46:30.442
LIAM: What's that?

03:46:30.442 --> 03:46:36.195
WILL: First: it's one-one. And second: don't get
us all dead.

03:46:36.195 --> 03:46:37.531
LIAM: All right, cutie.

03:46:37.531 --> 03:46:39.759
WILL: Good luck in battle.

03:46:39.759 --> 03:46:48.064
MARY: So I go running out. Lizard face. Once I get
out of the tunnel, Mask of Many Faces, lizard. I

03:46:48.064 --> 03:46:52.297
just go walking up. Within 90 feet, I cast Evard's
Black Tentacles, hoping to hold them.

03:46:52.297 --> 03:46:55.086
MATT: Okay. As she's doing this, anyone else doing
anything else? Are you--?

03:46:55.086 --> 03:46:58.384
SAM: I put on Gloves of Climbing to climb up
the thing.

03:46:58.384 --> 03:47:00.292
TALIESIN: Spiderwalk.

03:47:00.292 --> 03:47:06.147
WILL: Kash just stands with his back to them,
guarding them as they're going up the wall, spear

03:47:06.147 --> 03:47:07.191
at the ready.

03:47:07.191 --> 03:47:08.234
MATT: Okay.

03:47:08.234 --> 03:47:10.089
LIAM: Are you brooming it? I'm holding onto the
broom.

03:47:10.089 --> 03:47:11.884
MATT: Okay. You guys go up there.

03:47:11.884 --> 03:47:15.724
LAURA: I drop the rope down so Grog and Pike and
everybody else can go up.

03:47:15.724 --> 03:47:20.963
MATT: Easy enough. You all eventually get your way
up to the top and duck in an alley. I need you

03:47:20.963 --> 03:47:22.832
to roll stealth checks.

03:47:22.832 --> 03:47:23.968
TALIESIN: We still have that--

03:47:23.968 --> 03:47:25.654
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace that I cast? Yeah--

03:47:25.654 --> 03:47:29.370
MATT: All of you would, since it hasn't expired.
It's an hour concentration.

03:47:29.370 --> 03:47:30.893
SAM: 27.

03:47:30.893 --> 03:47:33.510
LAURA: Can I cast it again?

03:47:33.510 --> 03:47:40.771
MATT: No, I mean it's still on. It's an hour
concentration. It'll last until--

03:47:40.771 --> 03:47:42.029
TALIESIN: 21.

03:47:42.029 --> 03:47:43.928
MATT: Well actually, you cast it right before you
guys got to the keep, right?

03:47:43.928 --> 03:47:45.316
LAURA: Right, at the keep.

03:47:45.316 --> 03:47:48.935
MATT: No, no-- Yeah, so you do not have it
currently. I'm sorry.

03:47:48.935 --> 03:47:50.169
MARISHA: 18.

03:47:50.169 --> 03:47:51.411
TALIESIN: 11.

03:47:51.411 --> 03:47:53.056
LAURA: Do we get advantage because we're
invisible?

03:47:53.056 --> 03:47:54.741
MATT: The invisible folks do, yeah.

03:47:54.741 --> 03:47:55.965
LAURA: Ah okay, good.

03:47:55.965 --> 03:47:57.391
WILL: (chuckles) Invisible folks.

03:47:57.391 --> 03:48:00.014
LIAM: 31.

03:48:00.014 --> 03:48:01.967
LAURA: 21.

03:48:01.967 --> 03:48:03.732
SAM: 27.

03:48:03.732 --> 03:48:12.692
MATT: All right. And-- okay. You guys manage to
dart up-- you notice-- First off, the

03:48:12.692 --> 03:48:21.731
wyverns are now coasting by and scooting over the
sky, in groups of ten at a time. And you can see

03:48:21.731 --> 03:48:26.712
now as the bolts of energy are starting to hit--
Off in the distance, you see a flash and (lighting

03:48:26.712 --> 03:48:30.985
strikes) as one gets taken down by a bolt of
lightning. The wind is now picking up and

03:48:30.985 --> 03:48:35.279
beginning to swirl. You watch as they're having a
hard time flying and being harried by the

03:48:35.279 --> 03:48:42.568
elements, just darting around and slamming into
them. One of the fire giants sees movement over

03:48:42.568 --> 03:48:50.130
in your direction (speaks in Giant), and starts
walking that way as you begin to emerge in your

03:48:50.130 --> 03:48:51.934
lizard-person form.

03:48:51.934 --> 03:48:55.888
SAM: Can I quietly inspire Kash?

03:48:55.888 --> 03:48:58.635
MATT: You can if you like.

03:48:58.635 --> 03:49:13.507
SAM: (singing) Kash! King of the Universe! Kash!
Ah-ah! He is the best of us!

03:49:13.507 --> 03:49:15.966
WILL: (singing) And his hair was parted in the
middle--

03:49:15.966 --> 03:49:18.462
(laughter)

03:49:18.462 --> 03:49:20.415
MATT: Take your d12 inspiration die.

03:49:20.415 --> 03:49:21.818
WILL: Where's my d12?

03:49:21.818 --> 03:49:24.172
MARY: You just hold on to it.

03:49:24.172 --> 03:49:27.585
WILL: My gosh-- Oh! Yeah, I'm just holding it.

03:49:27.585 --> 03:49:28.806
(laughter)

03:49:28.806 --> 03:49:34.003
MATT: So, as you walk forward and lift your hands
up, clutching the staff, you watch as these black

03:49:34.003 --> 03:49:39.277
ethereal tentacles burst out of the ground, slam
into the ground, and attempt to wrap around the legs

03:49:39.277 --> 03:49:43.616
and lower body of these giants. What is your spell
DC?

03:49:43.616 --> 03:49:49.249
SAM: It's been a while since she's played, guys.

03:49:49.249 --> 03:49:50.683
MARY: 18.

03:49:50.683 --> 03:49:59.869
MATT: 18, all right. The fire giant-- oh! Nope! A
two and a three on their dex save.

03:49:59.869 --> 03:50:01.352
(cheering)

03:50:01.352 --> 03:50:07.041
MATT: All right. Yeah, so they're both restrained
and they take 3d6 bludgeoning damage, if you

03:50:07.041 --> 03:50:10.467
want to go ahead and roll that.

03:50:10.467 --> 03:50:28.704
MARY: 3d6? They're restrained! And it's 3d6
bludgeoning damage, which is ten.

03:50:28.704 --> 03:50:32.725
SAM: Both of them? You just restrained two fire
giants?! Holy shit!

03:50:32.725 --> 03:50:34.557
TALIESIN: Ten is on the good side of 3d6--

03:50:34.557 --> 03:50:37.913
MATT: You watch as it pulls them back, their
swords are held at bay, their wrists are bound by

03:50:37.977 --> 03:50:46.045
these tentacles, and both of them are being
crushed by it. And the other one-- No one here

03:50:46.045 --> 03:50:47.764
speaks Giant, except for Grog.

03:50:47.764 --> 03:50:49.518
WILL: I speak Giant.

03:50:49.518 --> 03:50:50.651
MATT: You do?

03:50:50.651 --> 03:50:59.324
MATT: You and Grog hear it, and it just says,
"Under attack!" in Giant. And as they're both

03:50:59.324 --> 03:51:02.793
being held there, as you're holding them in place,
they take the damage. What are the rest of you

03:51:02.793 --> 03:51:04.164
guys doing?

03:51:04.164 --> 03:51:10.184
MARISHA: I immediately, right above us, create a
little eye-of-the-hurricane. And you know when it

03:51:10.184 --> 03:51:15.855
snows and there's a moonbow? A rainbow? I do a
little bit of a moonbow situation.

03:51:15.855 --> 03:51:20.804
LAURA: Okay, are we trying to keep stealthed
and then letting Zarah and Kash--

03:51:20.804 --> 03:51:22.751
SAM: I think we just go.

03:51:22.751 --> 03:51:24.507
TALIESIN: We're going to pass them.

03:51:24.507 --> 03:51:26.210
MARISHA: And then we run!

03:51:26.210 --> 03:51:32.695
MATT: Okay. You guys all bolt towards the--
there's a 15-foot gap between these two giants

03:51:32.695 --> 03:51:39.927
right now. And you're rushing across this, like a
double-dash, you get just to them as it comes to

03:51:39.927 --> 03:51:41.144
their go.

03:51:41.144 --> 03:51:42.693
LAURA: I thought we were up and over the wall.

03:51:42.693 --> 03:51:45.055
SAM: No, no. We were out of the pipe.

03:51:45.055 --> 03:51:46.453
LAURA: I understand.

03:51:46.453 --> 03:51:51.962
MATT: Yes. At this point, as Keyleth runs and
creates this moonbow in this clearing in the sky,

03:51:51.962 --> 03:51:59.516
the wind suddenly doubles in speed in the air,
the bolts come down at twice the pace. You watch

03:51:59.516 --> 03:52:04.482
as rooftops are exploding. You see wyverns being
struck and thrown to the ground. You see small

03:52:04.482 --> 03:52:10.579
funnel clouds begin to form in portions of the
city, as the cloud itself is beginning to draw.

03:52:10.579 --> 03:52:15.361
And you start seeing a similar dark speck to what
you saw in the sky before, coming to land before

03:52:15.361 --> 03:52:21.915
you-- You see distant skysails flickering in and
out of the storm, control over this. As this is

03:52:21.915 --> 03:52:29.546
happening, as you guys are running with that
symbol, you hear far to the left a large

03:52:29.546 --> 03:52:39.003
explosion sound in the distance. It sounded like
an impact against a wall. You get the sense that

03:52:39.003 --> 03:52:45.241
it has begun. You guys rush up to the edge of the
door just as the two giants are going to attempt to break

03:52:45.241 --> 03:52:52.405
free from the tentacles. That is dexterity.
Strength or dexterity check against your save DC.

03:52:52.405 --> 03:53:00.470
So that's going to be helpful, so strength is much
better than the dex. Not with a three! Or a seven.

03:53:00.470 --> 03:53:02.677
I'm rolling as bad as I did on--

03:53:02.677 --> 03:53:06.257
MARY: Stay right where you are, boys!

03:53:06.257 --> 03:53:10.913
MATT: Both of them just still locked in place.
They both try desperately, staring down at you and

03:53:10.913 --> 03:53:16.070
growling, you can see the strain as the tentacles are
pulling on them, their swords burning--

03:53:16.139 --> 03:53:17.454
MARY: Welcome to hentai!

03:53:17.454 --> 03:53:20.080
(laughter)

03:53:20.080 --> 03:53:24.095
MATT: --and you're keeping guard there, at the
ready. What are you guys doing? You're at the door now.

03:53:24.095 --> 03:53:26.838
SAM: Grog! Can Grog punch through it? I don't--

03:53:26.838 --> 03:53:34.264
MATT: "Yes, I can!" And he goes for a full swing
against the door-- Yeah! Oh, man! Okay.

03:53:34.264 --> 03:53:35.926
LIAM: (in Grog's voice) Surprise, gents!

03:53:35.926 --> 03:53:51.091
MATT: Basically. So that's double-damage with
Siege to the door. Yeah. That is just with his

03:53:51.091 --> 03:53:57.342
fist, not even using his axe, just his fist
against the door. The first hit, he dealt 26

03:53:57.342 --> 03:54:02.524
points of bludgeoning damage. For the second
strike, he brings up the axe now, as he dented it

03:54:02.524 --> 03:54:16.016
inward, and swings with it. Ooh! That's 32 points
of damage to the door. You watch as the fist slams

03:54:16.016 --> 03:54:20.010
between the doors, and they're large, large, heavy
wooden doors you're very familiar with that have

03:54:20.010 --> 03:54:26.256
metal reinforcements on them on this part of the gate.
The fist slam causes them to shudder at the impact

03:54:26.348 --> 03:54:33.380
and shake, but the chains still holding them in
the inside are taut. The axe comes by. As it hits

03:54:33.380 --> 03:54:38.650
the edge of the wood and the iron, the wood
splinters, the iron bends, and the hinges actually

03:54:38.650 --> 03:54:45.577
(impact) off of one, and the gate slams off the
side, off the top hinge, and you all have to try

03:54:45.577 --> 03:54:53.104
to dart out of the way as it swings past. Oh,
man! It's not quite big enough to hit all of you,

03:54:53.104 --> 03:54:59.877
and I would say the ones that're at the front line
would probably be the twins and probably Keyleth.

03:54:59.877 --> 03:55:05.541
You'd want to stick with them. Well, you'd be back
because of the storm cloud-- Yeah. And Grog,

03:55:05.617 --> 03:55:09.542
definitely. So the twins and Grog, I need you guys
to make a dexterity saving throw.

03:55:09.542 --> 03:55:11.280
Natural 20 for Grog!

03:55:11.280 --> 03:55:13.196
(cheering)

03:55:13.196 --> 03:55:15.436
LIAM: Would Evasion work for this?

03:55:15.436 --> 03:55:17.246
LAURA: 28.

03:55:17.246 --> 03:55:21.599
LIAM: That's a dex save. All right, it's just 20 with
me.

03:55:21.599 --> 03:55:26.967
MATT: Okay, it's fine. You guys all duck out of
the way as soon as the door slams into the mud to

03:55:26.967 --> 03:55:34.014
the side, the giants still restrained. You all
begin to charge into the space without thinking.

03:55:34.014 --> 03:55:37.907
As soon as the opening's there, you dart in as the
giants are restrained. And you guys, what are you

03:55:37.907 --> 03:55:42.073
doing at this point? The giants aren't going to be
held for long.

03:55:42.073 --> 03:55:44.051
MARY: Kash?

03:55:44.051 --> 03:55:46.666
WILL: Can I cast Geas on one and have one attack
the other?

03:55:46.666 --> 03:55:50.881
MARY: Swing away, Kash.

03:55:50.881 --> 03:55:53.203
WILL: Am I allowed to take control of one of
them?

03:55:53.203 --> 03:55:57.886
MATT: Oh, I will see what the-- casting time is
one minute. So that's ten rounds that you have to

03:55:57.886 --> 03:56:00.995
cast that spell-- It's not much of a combat spell,
really.

03:56:00.995 --> 03:56:08.676
WILL: Because they're flame giants, right? Does a
Flame Strike work on them? Or are they susceptible

03:56:08.676 --> 03:56:09.854
to flames, or no?

03:56:09.854 --> 03:56:11.832
MATT: That is up to what you might expect.

03:56:11.832 --> 03:56:16.513
WILL: Then let's give it a try. We're going to try
to do a 5th-level Flame Strike and see what

03:56:16.513 --> 03:56:17.644
happens.

03:56:17.644 --> 03:56:26.095
MATT: All righty! Go ahead and roll 4d6 radiant
damage. Both restrained, so they have disadvantage

03:56:26.095 --> 03:56:30.491
on the save. Yeah, no.

03:56:30.491 --> 03:56:33.767
WILL: I also still have my inspiration, too.

03:56:33.767 --> 03:56:35.390
SAM: It won't help here.

03:56:35.390 --> 03:56:46.798
WILL: I know. Okay, it's okay. Yeah-- well, no.
It's awful, I-- It's 13. Yeah. 13

03:56:46.798 --> 03:56:50.094
MATT: All right. They both take 13 points of
damage. They take no fire damage, they're both

03:56:50.094 --> 03:56:55.429
immune to fire. The flames do nothing, but the
radiant burst in itself does singe the exterior of

03:56:55.429 --> 03:57:01.383
their bodies. You see them rock with pain as
the blast of light, a column that shoots at them,

03:57:01.383 --> 03:57:05.444
bursts into them, has taken effect. Not as much as
you would have wanted, but an effect nonetheless.

03:57:05.444 --> 03:57:11.003
You, who are still maintaining concentration on
this spell, what do you want to do?

03:57:11.003 --> 03:57:20.099
MARY: What is the radius of Witchbolt? If I drop
Evard's and hit-- they're 15 feet apart from each

03:57:20.099 --> 03:57:21.004
other?

03:57:21.004 --> 03:57:22.624
MATT: They're 15 feet apart from each other, yes.

03:57:22.624 --> 03:57:26.085
MARY: I just don't know what the radius of
Witchbolt is. Can I hit both of them with it?

03:57:26.085 --> 03:57:29.610
MATT: With Witchbolt? With Witchbolt, as a--

03:57:29.610 --> 03:57:33.165
TALIESIN: You'd need a ten-foot radius to hit both
of them.

03:57:33.165 --> 03:57:48.485
MATT: It's going to be a tough call. Let me see--
Witchbolt-- No, no. Witchbolt hits one creature.

03:57:48.485 --> 03:57:49.895
MARY: Only hits one creature?

03:57:49.895 --> 03:57:58.630
MATT: Yeah. You can still maintain a concentration
spell and do instant spells, if you wanted to.

03:57:58.630 --> 03:58:06.232
MARY: Yes! So then I will hold Evard's Black
Tentacles and use a cantrip of Eldritch Blast and

03:58:06.232 --> 03:58:07.944
Agonizing Blast? Can I do that?

03:58:07.944 --> 03:58:13.386
MATT: Yeah, it's part of the ability. So, yeah,
you can do that. Make three spell attack rolls.

03:58:13.386 --> 03:58:16.707
SAM: Three spells?! She's so powerful!

03:58:16.707 --> 03:58:18.675
MATT: It's all against one guy or it's--? How are
you splitting it up?

03:58:18.675 --> 03:58:21.545
MARY: I'm going to hit two on the left, one on the
right.

03:58:21.545 --> 03:58:24.547
MATT: Two on the left, one on the right.
Okay. Go for it.

03:58:24.547 --> 03:58:39.702
MATT: Your spell attack bonus is--?

03:58:39.702 --> 03:58:44.276
MARY: Plus 12, so 15. Plus Agonizing Blast--

03:58:44.276 --> 03:58:46.010
MATT: That only adds to damage.

03:58:46.010 --> 03:58:47.655
MARY: 15.

03:58:47.655 --> 03:58:53.219
MATT: So the first one you fire at? It arcs past
and hits the door behind, hitting the

03:58:53.219 --> 03:58:55.751
where the already damaged door 
fell off the hinges.

03:58:55.751 --> 03:58:58.599
MARY: It's 20--

03:58:58.599 --> 03:59:03.810
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll-- So you've hit
one, now roll for hitting the other.

03:59:03.810 --> 03:59:05.437
MARY: Oh, natural 20.

03:59:05.437 --> 03:59:18.397
MATT: Okay! So go ahead and your roll damage on that.
Roll your d10 plus seven. What's the first one?

03:59:18.397 --> 03:59:19.772
LAURA: 2d10?

03:59:19.772 --> 03:59:22.268
MATT: No, it's 1d10 for the first roll, next one
is the critical.

03:59:22.268 --> 03:59:26.940
MARY: That's a ten.

03:59:26.940 --> 03:59:31.125
MATT: And roll one more time.

03:59:31.125 --> 03:59:32.808
MARY: Plus my charisma?

03:59:32.808 --> 03:59:36.580
MATT: Correct. Add that in there. So go ahead and
roll for your critical now.

03:59:36.580 --> 03:59:43.158
MARY: Six. Plus my charisma, which is eleven,
right?

03:59:43.158 --> 03:59:47.865
MATT: Great! So you blast both of them and they're
still held in place. You guys run past. They're

03:59:47.865 --> 03:59:53.639
both taking hits from Zahra, but they're both more
focused on the people that are being led through

03:59:53.639 --> 03:59:55.955
the gate they were ordered to watch. And--

03:59:55.955 --> 03:59:57.966
LIAM: How far are the twins from the giant?

03:59:57.966 --> 03:59:59.749
MATT: You guys just ran through into the--

03:59:59.749 --> 04:00:00.748
LIAM: Right through?

04:00:00.748 --> 04:00:02.218
LAURA: We want to take sneak attacks on both of
them.

04:00:02.218 --> 04:00:03.333
MATT: Go for it.

04:00:03.333 --> 04:00:09.065
And five and a seven, they cannot make their
checks for shit.

04:00:09.065 --> 04:00:17.181
LAURA: First one hits. And then 21, does that
hit?

04:00:17.181 --> 04:00:18.138
MATT: Hits.

04:00:18.138 --> 04:00:22.331
LAURA: Okay, do I get three attacks-- oh, no, no,
no, I'm not clicking the boots yet.

04:00:22.331 --> 04:00:23.537
LIAM: 21. So 21 hits?

04:00:23.537 --> 04:00:24.788
MATT: 21 hits, yeah.

04:00:24.788 --> 04:00:28.129
LAURA: Augh, what's happening?!

04:00:28.129 --> 04:00:38.848
LIAM: Okay, so the first one was-- All the dice,
all the dice.

04:00:38.848 --> 04:00:55.437
LAURA: So, 15 for the first hit. 22 for the
second.

04:00:55.437 --> 04:01:00.270
LIAM: 36 for my first, and eight for my second.

04:01:00.270 --> 04:01:05.642
LAURA: And just keep running.

04:01:05.642 --> 04:01:12.465
MATT: And keep running, okay. All right, so you
guys lob those attacks as you're rushing past, you

04:01:12.465 --> 04:01:17.448
guys see-- actually, both of you guys roll
perception checks.

04:01:17.448 --> 04:01:25.403
WILL: 14.

04:01:25.403 --> 04:01:27.495
MARY: 12.

04:01:27.495 --> 04:01:33.164
MATT: 12. You just make it-- you, Kashaw, out of
the corner of your eye, you notice the buildings

04:01:33.164 --> 04:01:42.263
that were on fire, the flames that were burning
amidst the storm, you watch as one of the flames leaps

04:01:42.263 --> 04:01:49.189
out of the house. And a number of other flames
begin to rise up as living, flaming entities that

04:01:49.189 --> 04:01:52.871
are making their way towards you. And you can
quickly see that this is about to become--

04:01:52.871 --> 04:01:54.621
WILL: Awesome.

04:01:54.621 --> 04:01:55.656
MATT: --awesome.

04:01:55.656 --> 04:01:57.448
(laughter)

04:01:57.448 --> 04:02:00.282
MATT: But as you see Vox Machina running into the
Cloudtop District and disappearing into the

04:02:00.282 --> 04:02:02.597
surrounding clouds and fume.

04:02:02.597 --> 04:02:04.965
WILL: May the gods be with you.

04:02:04.965 --> 04:02:11.854
LIAM: Totally minor, I didn't add my regular bonus
for dex and all that, so add another eight to my

04:02:11.854 --> 04:02:12.638
damage.

04:02:12.638 --> 04:02:13.860
MATT: Okay, got it.

04:02:13.860 --> 04:02:17.239
MARY: So they're leaving.

04:02:17.239 --> 04:02:18.510
MATT: You got them in.

04:02:18.510 --> 04:02:27.347
MARY: Go! Go! We'll find you if we can! In the
meantime, my love, shall we have some fun?

04:02:27.347 --> 04:02:29.278
WILL: Let's do this thing, baby!

04:02:29.278 --> 04:02:30.606
MARY: Yeah!

04:02:30.606 --> 04:02:37.633
MATT: You guys hear the distant sounds of battle
conflict inside the wall and far beyond. You hear,

04:02:37.633 --> 04:02:46.358
in the distance, the weird, vibrating fuzzy echo
of hundreds and hundreds of voices shouting in

04:02:46.358 --> 04:02:53.610
unison. The battle's upon Emon. However, that
moment quickly shifts as you're walking through

04:02:53.610 --> 04:02:59.276
this volcanic fume; the air itself is sulfurous,
and there are gouts of poison that spill forth

04:02:59.276 --> 04:03:06.360
from cracked earth. You can see points, little
bursts of glowing, molten rock that break through

04:03:06.360 --> 04:03:15.263
the surface and pour and then cool and create
these small, miniaturized volcanic spires. You can

04:03:15.263 --> 04:03:21.190
see the burned, destroyed, crumbled remnants of
the buildings-- the noble houses, the beautiful

04:03:21.190 --> 04:03:26.220
mansions that used to make up the entirety of the
Cloudtop District. The homes that you'd look at

04:03:26.220 --> 04:03:30.402
and think, "God, one day it'd be great to live in
something as beautiful as that," reduced to ash

04:03:30.402 --> 04:03:31.784
and cinder.

04:03:31.784 --> 04:03:42.965
Your run slows as you begin to see this large
crater wall that lifts up through the smoke, a lip

04:03:42.965 --> 04:03:52.450
that then vanishes over the edge where the smoke
is pouring out like a thick column, a slow-moving,

04:03:52.450 --> 04:04:10.703
stationary tornado of black that pours into the
sky. As you watch, two large, bulbous, scaled red

04:04:10.703 --> 04:04:23.399
arms shoot forth from the center, as one long,
unfurling dragon neck rises up. You see the red

04:04:23.399 --> 04:04:30.224
crystalline brow itself, like jagged daggers of
flame burst across the face as it rises up beyond

04:04:30.224 --> 04:04:37.807
the smoke. The teeth, impossibly long and pointed
for something of this size. The eyes, not red, not

04:04:37.807 --> 04:04:48.030
yellow, but burning beams of pure white light,
like a small sun exists in each eye. As it lifts

04:04:48.030 --> 04:04:56.171
its whole form upwards out of the hole, the wings
unfurl, the wind itself pushing all the smoke out,

04:04:56.171 --> 04:05:04.375
clearing the Cloudtop for but an instant, to see
its massive, swollen form. You also notice that

04:05:04.375 --> 04:05:15.975
within its chest, this large, thick scar, but no
crystal. Just a large, bulbous, grown-over, thick

04:05:15.975 --> 04:05:18.515
piece of scaled scar.

04:05:18.515 --> 04:05:28.027
As it stands towering above all of you, peering
over the distance, not even noticing you at the

04:05:28.027 --> 04:05:40.473
moment, surveying the chaos around in Emon, its
face drops, and you hear this voice gurgle up from

04:05:40.473 --> 04:05:47.151
within. Sourceless, almost, in its immensity, in
its encompassing nature, it says,

04:05:47.151 --> 04:06:00.571
"It appears that we have guests. Where are you?"

04:06:00.571 --> 04:06:02.274
And that's where we'll end tonight's episode.

04:06:02.274 --> 04:06:07.586
(cheering and screaming)

04:06:07.586 --> 04:06:18.042
MARISHA: Can we all take a nervous swig of our
fire resistance potions? Like, right now? Like glug, glug, glug!

04:06:18.042 --> 04:06:24.013
MATT: It's to the instance where, right now,
there's so much going on that Thordak is having

04:06:24.013 --> 04:06:28.964
this Superman moment where he closes his eyes and
hears all the screams in the city at once. So you

04:06:28.964 --> 04:06:35.258
don't know if he knows where you are yet, or has
seen you, he just knows that something's here. And

04:06:35.258 --> 04:06:36.990
that's where we're going to pick up next session.

04:06:36.990 --> 04:06:38.762
LIAM: Double-fisting them, gulp gulp!

04:06:38.762 --> 04:06:48.348
TALIESIN: Smoke 'em if you got 'em! I'm going
to vape-- I'm going to vape my fire resistance.

04:06:48.348 --> 04:06:54.879
MATT: I'm pretty sure you can get that at Critical
Vapes.

04:06:54.879 --> 04:06:56.569
TALIESIN: Oh yeah! You can get that there.

04:06:56.569 --> 04:06:58.157
MARY: Critical Vapes!

04:06:58.157 --> 04:06:59.905
LAURA: Shout out!

04:06:59.905 --> 04:07:01.694
LIAM: Merry deathmas, everyone.

04:07:01.694 --> 04:07:03.515
TALIESIN: Merry deathmas.

04:07:03.515 --> 04:07:06.947
SAM: What happens to Kash and Zahra?!

04:07:06.947 --> 04:07:12.226
MATT: They're currently preventing you guys
from having to deal with Thordak and two fire

04:07:12.226 --> 04:07:13.840
giants and a bunch of elementals.

04:07:13.840 --> 04:07:16.846
SAM: But how do we know what happens?!

04:07:16.846 --> 04:07:18.179
TALIESIN: We don't die.

04:07:18.179 --> 04:07:20.701
MATT: Don't die and you'll find out.

04:07:20.701 --> 04:07:22.910
WILL: The Kash and Zahra show, starting next week
on Wednesdays.

04:07:22.910 --> 04:07:24.649
(laughter)

04:07:24.649 --> 04:07:27.919
MATT: If only.

04:07:27.919 --> 04:07:30.486
LAURA: It's just a buddy cop movie.

04:07:30.486 --> 04:07:33.284
MARY: We're in a really old Mustang the whole
time.

04:07:33.284 --> 04:07:35.867
WILL: He's a little bit country; she's a little
bit dragon.

04:07:35.867 --> 04:07:39.957
(laughter)

04:07:39.957 --> 04:07:42.649
TALIESIN: I would watch the fuck out of that.

04:07:42.649 --> 04:07:51.035
MATT: Yeah, I would. Oh my god. That's the best
version of Dallas I've ever heard of. Which has an

04:07:51.035 --> 04:07:52.404
RPG book.

04:07:52.404 --> 04:07:53.505
WILL: No!

04:07:53.505 --> 04:07:54.490
MATT: Oh yeah.

04:07:54.490 --> 04:07:55.706
SAM: You can roleplay Dallas?

04:07:55.706 --> 04:08:02.621
MATT: Yeah! I'm trying to find a copy of it. But
anyway, that's neither here nor there. We'll be

04:08:02.621 --> 04:08:09.395
here next week for the showdown with Thordak the
Cinder King in the center of Emon! You guys, you

04:08:09.395 --> 04:08:13.282
avoided a lot. You beelined to Thordak.

04:08:13.282 --> 04:08:15.814
LAURA: We were out of time!

04:08:15.814 --> 04:08:24.185
MATT: We would have gone into this next time. I
was preparing for Thordak--

04:08:24.185 --> 04:08:26.214
MARY: Always rely on tentacles.

04:08:26.214 --> 04:08:28.780
TALIESIN: If anime has taught you anything--

04:08:28.780 --> 04:08:30.192
MATT: Don't tell the internet that.

04:08:30.192 --> 04:08:32.780
MARY: If anime has taught us anything--

04:08:32.780 --> 04:08:39.393
MATT: I know! No, I was expecting this Thordak
encounter to either happen next week or in the first

04:08:39.393 --> 04:08:44.249
two weeks of January when we come back from the
break, I wasn't sure when. You bypassed a bunch there.

04:08:44.249 --> 04:08:46.228
WILL: Great way to end the year, though.

04:08:46.228 --> 04:08:47.785
MATT: It is a good way to end the year!

04:08:47.785 --> 04:08:51.816
LIAM: (singing) Here comes Cinder Claus, here
comes Cinder Claus, right down Cinder Claus Lane!

04:08:51.816 --> 04:08:56.180
MARY: Yeah, it's just the two of us and the fire
giants!

04:08:56.180 --> 04:08:58.508
WILL: While I sit back and watch her kick some
ass!

04:08:58.508 --> 04:09:00.448
TALIESIN: I thought you were dead, Fred!

04:09:00.448 --> 04:09:02.546
MARISHA: You told me they were dead!

04:09:02.546 --> 04:09:04.574
LIAM: We need Brian Blessed now!

04:09:04.574 --> 04:09:07.160
TALIESIN: We need Brian Blessed! We need Brian
Blessed for everything!

04:09:07.160 --> 04:09:11.876
MATT: I don't disagree with this.

04:09:11.876 --> 04:09:14.663
TALIESIN: He might be down.

04:09:14.663 --> 04:09:22.207
MATT: We'll see you guys next week for this crazy
showdown. Rest well, thank you Loot Crate and

04:09:22.207 --> 04:09:26.683
Magic Puzzle Quest for being our awesome sponsors
for tonight's episode. Thank you all for your

04:09:26.683 --> 04:09:28.842
patience. Thank you, Will and Mary, for joining
us.

04:09:28.842 --> 04:09:32.771
WILL: Thanks for having us, you kidding? Thanks for
having us back.

04:09:32.771 --> 04:09:33.979
MARY: Thank you so much!

04:09:33.979 --> 04:09:36.177
MARISHA: Thanks for sacrificing yourself.
Hopefully you're not dead.

04:09:36.177 --> 04:09:41.141
WILL: It's the only show where you can walk by,
"Hey, thanks, hope you're not dead."

04:09:41.141 --> 04:09:46.275
LAURA: Are we allowed to say, Brian, that they're
going to be on Talks Machina?

04:09:46.275 --> 04:09:47.734
BRIAN: (offscreen) Yeah!

04:09:47.734 --> 04:09:56.547
MARY: So we're going to be on Talks Machina on
Tuesday. With that Brian Foster man!

04:09:56.547 --> 04:09:58.263
SAM: Are you going to be on Talks Machina?

04:09:58.263 --> 04:09:59.323
MATT: I don't know.

04:09:59.323 --> 04:10:01.084
LAURA: No, we can't know his secrets just yet!

04:10:01.084 --> 04:10:04.360
SAM: But if you were on Talks Machina, then you
could do this whole fight on Talks Machina.

04:10:04.360 --> 04:10:06.337
(laughter)

04:10:06.337 --> 04:10:09.327
MATT: I've been on a lot of Talks Machina
recently, and I could probably use a Tuesday night off.

04:10:09.327 --> 04:10:10.425
MARY and WILL: Yeah.

04:10:10.425 --> 04:10:11.743
MATT: Especially to prepare for this.

04:10:11.743 --> 04:10:13.765
LAURA: Plus I don't want to know any secrets
before we go into this fight.

04:10:13.765 --> 04:10:15.918
MATT: I wouldn't tell you any secrets regardless,
which is why I'd be a very boring guest next week.

04:10:15.918 --> 04:10:19.233
I'd be like: I don't know. That's a great
question.

04:10:19.233 --> 04:10:22.419
MARISHA: You Don't Know: The Show.

04:10:22.419 --> 04:10:27.476
MATT: Exactly. All right, guys, thank you so much,
guys. Thank you guys, have a wonderful weekend.

04:10:27.476 --> 04:10:34.207
We'll see you next Tuesday for Talks Machina and
Thursday for the finale, possibly, much love and

04:10:34.207 --> 04:10:36.952
is it Thursday yet? See you soon.

04:10:36.952 --> 04:16:26.554
