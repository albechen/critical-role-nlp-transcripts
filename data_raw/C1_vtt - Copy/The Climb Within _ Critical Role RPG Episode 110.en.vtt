00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:06.012
MATT: We've just returned from the chaos of Gen
Con, which was awesome, and we're all still

00:00:06.012 --> 00:00:09.295
recovering from that chaos. It was a very
high-energy weekend. We got to meet a lot of you

00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:13.300
guys out there. Didn't get to meet enough of you.
There's only so much time in the weekend, and

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.230
those that we didn't, we'll hopefully get a chance
to meet you at a future event. The live show went

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.765
really well. We hope people who were there enjoyed
it.

00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:27.706
Let's see. We have Laura and Travis coming in hot
right now. They'll be here as soon as they can. In

00:00:27.706 --> 00:00:33.465
the interim, couple announcements, couple fun
things. One, there will not be a standard episode

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:38.131
of Critical Role next week because me, Taliesin,
Marisha, Laura, and Travis will be off in the

00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:44.367
desert somewhere. Instead, there will be a
one-shot being run by none other than the

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:49.206
wonderful, illustrious, talented Sam Riegel. His
first game of any roleplaying game

00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:51.095
he's ever DMed before.

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:58.563
SAM: I was just learning how to DM from Matt about
a minute ago! And I think I know.

00:00:58.563 --> 00:01:03.971
MATT: I think you've got this. You want to talk
about any of the people who will be playing with you?

00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:14.803
SAM: Sure! My players that I will be controlling--
that's how it works, right, Matt? My players will

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:26.088
be the talented and charming Liam O'Brien: dagger,
dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger; the charming and

00:01:26.088 --> 00:01:37.708
cabbage-smelling Brian Foster; friend of the show
and charming everything, Mary Elizabeth McGlynn;

00:01:37.708 --> 00:01:47.193
young Ashly Burch, pulling some shit out of her
ass, I'm sure, which is going to be awesome; and

00:01:47.193 --> 00:01:55.020
then a player we have not played with yet. He's a
lovely voice actor and a talented man: Eric Bauza.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.527
Look him up on IMDB. He's the voice of
everything.

00:01:58.527 --> 00:02:00.951
LIAM: Bauza is funny as fuck.

00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:03.565
SAM: He has never played Dungeons and Dragons
before.

00:02:03.565 --> 00:02:09.046
MATT: I'm legitimately sad that we're gone next
week. Just so we can't be in the wings, to watch

00:02:09.046 --> 00:02:10.334
it in person.

00:02:10.334 --> 00:02:12.809
MARISHA: We'll have a lot of road time to watch it
on the way back.

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:20.379
LIAM: With Bauza at the table, any celebrity could
show up. He can impersonate anybody. Anybody.

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.603
MATT: He has about five or six years before he
becomes the voiceover industry. The living

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:31.918
embodiment of it. Absorbs us like end of Akira. So
that's going to be fun. Look forward to that next

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:34.958
week. Let's see, what else?

00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.572
SAM: Merch, Laura-- oh.

00:02:37.572 --> 00:02:40.361
LIAM: Oh, there's some stuff in the store!

00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:45.266
MARISHA: Oh man! So many good things!

00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:50.158
LIAM: Okay, go to Geek and Sundry's dot com,
whatever the store is!

00:02:50.158 --> 00:02:59.324
MATT: You're going to get the shit beat out of
you. She's watching it right now.

00:02:59.324 --> 00:03:05.400
TALIESIN: Oh. Well, then you're in trouble.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.229
SAM: Is there a book update? Is there a sticker
update? Is there a shirt update?

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:18.690
MARISHA: There is a sticker update. We found them.
The mail has found them from where USPS quite

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:27.133
literally lost them. I think the distributor found
them and now they're bringing some back to the

00:03:27.133 --> 00:03:31.159
distributor so they can be sent back to us, and
then we will be dropping those in the mail.

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.808
MATT: We'll be giving those to everyone who was
there at Gen Con and signed up. Whatever's left

00:03:34.808 --> 00:03:40.126
over, we'll get announcements up as to how we can
get those to some folks, as well. We've got a

00:03:40.126 --> 00:03:47.136
process on that one. The Tal'Dorei Campaign Guide
went well, apparently, at Gen Con. People seemed

00:03:47.136 --> 00:03:50.758
to like it. I hope you like it. I know they're
pushing hard to get those orders out, all

00:03:50.758 --> 00:03:58.358
pre-orders, by mid- to late-September. So follow
@GreenRoninPub at Twitter for any updates on when

00:03:58.358 --> 00:04:00.343
those'll be going out. Thank you very much.

00:04:00.343 --> 00:04:05.265
LIAM: We should probably re-announce the art book
that we're making. There's an art book that's

00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:09.837
happening. It's going to hit in the fall, at some
point. It's amazing. We've seen it. We've held an

00:04:09.837 --> 00:04:11.271
approximation of it.

00:04:11.271 --> 00:04:13.263
MATT: We've all sobbed silently as we've looked
through it.

00:04:13.263 --> 00:04:15.337
LIAM: It's beautiful.

00:04:15.337 --> 00:04:19.071
MATT: It's the phenomenal celebration of
everything that you guys have put together around

00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:24.234
this game and I'm so excited for you guys to see
it.

00:04:24.234 --> 00:04:27.570
MARISHA: It feels like a time capsule, but in a
book.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:34.957
LIAM: And as long as we're vamping, I've seen some
of that comic book, man. It's looking good. It's

00:04:34.957 --> 00:04:38.408
under the table in my bag. It looks so good.

00:04:38.408 --> 00:04:46.865
MATT: Our buddy Mr. Colville's done a fine job.
Olivia's done an amazing job, as well. Everyone

00:04:46.865 --> 00:04:48.331
involved has been great.

00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:51.237
MARISHA: It's so cute. We love it.

00:04:51.237 --> 00:04:56.964
SAM: I think we've stalled all we can stall,
right? By the way, the reason Travis and Laura are

00:04:56.964 --> 00:05:05.154
not here is because we all brought our dice and
our little character sheets to Indianapolis, and

00:05:05.154 --> 00:05:07.886
they left theirs at home, so they drove home to go
get it.

00:05:07.886 --> 00:05:13.294
MARISHA: Yeah. Because you need a character sheet.
It's important when you've crawled into a

00:05:13.294 --> 00:05:15.806
mountain's butt.

00:05:15.806 --> 00:05:20.845
MATT: Yeah. That's what the name of this module is
going to be: Crawling into the Mountain's Butt.

00:05:20.845 --> 00:05:22.672
Gygax would be proud.

00:05:22.672 --> 00:05:26.508
LIAM: We're behind his meniscus, right? Aren't we
in his knee?

00:05:26.508 --> 00:05:30.531
MATT: Hip joint.

00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:32.900
LIAM: Oh, real close to the butt, yeah!

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.296
MARISHA: Right in that sciatic nerve.

00:05:37.296 --> 00:05:42.881
MATT: Bringing it into territory I'm very familiar
with right now.

00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:47.868
MARISHA: Can we do that? Can we find pressure
points and take him down with acupressure?

00:05:47.868 --> 00:05:55.265
MATT: That's up to you guys. Oh, and for next
week, for Talks, I believe you're doing a special

00:05:55.265 --> 00:05:56.462
Talks Machina?

00:05:56.462 --> 00:05:59.773
LIAM: We're doing something. We're going to fuck
around.

00:05:59.773 --> 00:06:05.048
SAM: I don't actually know. I'm laser-focused on
my shitty one-shot.

00:06:05.048 --> 00:06:09.118
LIAM: Brian and I are chatting about it. You'll be
naked.

00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:12.046
MARISHA: Thanks for tanking the week for us.

00:06:12.046 --> 00:06:19.604
SAM: We're also doing Wednesday Club, me and Liam.
We're going to be talking about my favorite book, Hellboy.

00:06:19.604 --> 00:06:24.130
LIAM: I'm going to be bringing in a bag of Bazooka Joe
comics, from the gum.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:36.159
MARISHA: Oh, I have something I can stall time
with. For those who didn't catch the debut episode

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:45.973
of One Night Only, it was awesome. We talked about
Sagas of Sundry: Dread. We dressed up. We made it

00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:55.207
an event. One Night Only is our special event
series that we are attempting to do monthly, is

00:06:55.207 --> 00:07:03.705
the goal. Where we bring you people from your
favorite fandom in entertainment and pop culture

00:07:03.705 --> 00:07:08.524
and get to ask questions with them, panel-style.
Inside the Actors Studio style.

00:07:08.524 --> 00:07:12.265
SAM: Are you James Lipton in this equation?

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:18.758
MARISHA: Well, it was Darin De Paul this past
week. We're going to switch it up, depending on

00:07:18.758 --> 00:07:29.259
what the subject matter is. I really want to do a
JPL One Night Only, where we bring all the smart

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:32.131
scientist dudes from NASA.

00:07:32.131 --> 00:07:36.082
LIAM: I'm sure there are Critters in Space-X.

00:07:36.082 --> 00:07:47.563
MARISHA: And then for those who missed it, we
announced at the end of One Night Only that there

00:07:47.563 --> 00:07:54.468
will be a season two of Sagas of Sundry, entitled
Madness.

00:07:54.468 --> 00:08:00.848
TALIESIN: Yeah, suddenly I showed up and there's
30 yards of red velvet that I've been begging for.

00:08:00.848 --> 00:08:04.277
LIAM: Boy, let me tell you what I had for lunch
today.

00:08:04.277 --> 00:08:14.363
SAM: We're essentially doing an episode of
allworknoplay right now. Should we start? Maybe by

00:08:14.363 --> 00:08:15.772
the time you're done--

00:08:15.772 --> 00:08:17.721
MATT: I think at this point, we need to.

00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:27.637
LIAM: I will jaeger Pike, Grog, and Vex. It will
be fine. "Titties. Let's do it."

00:08:27.637 --> 00:08:40.753
MATT: Anyway. (laughs) That being the case, as we
await the return of two of our players, let us

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:46.224
begin tonight's journey on tonight's episode of
Critical Role.

00:08:46.224 --> 00:10:16.368
[dramatic music]

00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:22.670
MATT: Hello, and welcome back. So. Last we left
off on this adventure--

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:30.372
(giggling)

00:10:30.372 --> 00:10:40.106
MATT: Goddamn it, Liam. Last we left off on this
adventure, Vox Machina had been counting down

00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:47.036
their preparations to the eventual showdown and
second battle with Vecna, whom they discovered

00:10:47.036 --> 00:10:53.297
recently had completed his ascension into godhood,
the only god on the Prime Material Plane. Not

00:10:53.297 --> 00:10:58.228
knowing what his plans were, you began to bring
together what information you had, upon gathering

00:10:58.228 --> 00:11:04.415
blessings from different deities and pieces of
their divinity to craft the Prime Trammels, a

00:11:04.415 --> 00:11:07.319
device that was once used to seal the Chained
Oblivion, long ago.

00:11:07.319 --> 00:11:12.705
You traveled deep beneath the volcano of
Scaldseat, beneath the ocean, off the coast of

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:17.972
Issylra. Between Percival and Grog's newfound
imbuement of skills and knowledge via Ioun, you

00:11:17.972 --> 00:11:24.920
managed to successfully defeat the guardian, craft
the trammels and return to Vasselheim, where you

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:32.479
discovered via Pike that there was a council
meeting happening within the Platinum Sanctuary.

00:11:32.479 --> 00:11:36.312
There you met up with the Hand of Ord.

00:11:36.312 --> 00:11:40.459
MARISHA: Yeah, everyone was there.

00:11:40.459 --> 00:11:48.257
MATT: High Hierophant Ophera of the Birthheart. There
was Earthbreaker Groon. There were Maidens of the

00:11:48.257 --> 00:11:55.291
Raven. Eventually, Allura and Kima, and J'mon Sa
Ord had also come into the fray.

00:11:55.291 --> 00:12:02.315
During this discussion about what to do, what to
handle, you were granted a ring by High Bearer

00:12:02.315 --> 00:12:08.450
Vord that, within a certain radius, could prevent
divinations or specifically scrying on you. Not

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:13.806
the School of Divination, but magics that divine
your location, whatever's in your vicinity.

00:12:13.806 --> 00:12:21.672
This moment, the council was interrupted by an
image of Vecna taunting you, until it was

00:12:21.672 --> 00:12:29.012
dispelled by Allura. The discussion was that
something was going on in the mountain range where

00:12:29.012 --> 00:12:34.016
Vecna seemed to have Thar Amphala, which had been
discovered by a couple of surviving wyvern riders.

00:12:34.016 --> 00:12:40.764
Thinking about the two possible locations that
could be of interest to Vecna, you gathered your

00:12:40.764 --> 00:12:47.226
materials, your preparations, and with the first
striking lot of wyvern riders, on the back of the

00:12:47.226 --> 00:12:55.309
newly transformed J'mon Sa Ord into the Devo'ssa
dragon form, you were transported via druids to

00:12:55.309 --> 00:13:00.908
the northern icy landscape of Issylra, to the base
of the Zenwick Mountains.

00:13:00.908 --> 00:13:07.828
You discovered that the Crypts of Thomara, an
ancient, forgotten dwarven society that had

00:13:07.828 --> 00:13:14.039
destroyed itself through cannibalism and madness
was now a sinkhole in the mountain range, and a

00:13:14.039 --> 00:13:24.721
series of large, heavy, 150-plus-foot-across
cavernous openings in the ground formed a pattern

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:34.357
that you soon discovered were footfalls. Steps.
You came upon the risen undead primordial earth

00:13:34.357 --> 00:13:44.082
titan, long left beneath the surface of the world,
dead since the Founding, now given unlife and

00:13:44.082 --> 00:13:51.925
walking its way southeast towards Vasselheim. Atop
its shoulders, you saw Thar Amphala, protected by

00:13:51.925 --> 00:13:54.241
some sort of magical barrier.

00:13:54.241 --> 00:14:00.589
There you struggled with a few fleets of flying
gloomstalkers that were charging their way towards

00:14:00.589 --> 00:14:09.697
you. You turned yourself invisible through both
Scanlan and J'mon Sa Ord-- J'mon or Devo'ssa: both

00:14:09.697 --> 00:14:18.156
forms, same person-- you managed to, thanks to a
very high roll from Keyleth, discover there was a

00:14:18.156 --> 00:14:25.452
waterfall or trickle of liquid near the hip of
this giant titan. Its giant, four, swinging arms

00:14:25.452 --> 00:14:32.954
of imminent danger in its vicinity only managed to
clip Keyleth and Vax once.

00:14:32.954 --> 00:14:40.160
Surviving the impact, you all gathered at this
ingress right around the hip of the titan, where

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:45.204
you leapt off the dragon and proceeded to make
your way in. Keyleth, using Control Water, was

00:14:45.204 --> 00:14:52.651
keeping the heavy flow of an underground river
from blowing you off the broken steps that lead

00:14:52.651 --> 00:14:57.644
into your entry. And that is where we left off.

00:14:57.644 --> 00:15:06.540
At this time, Keyleth, as you're all standing,
looking over your shoulder, you can see the

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:12.944
opening where you entered. It's this giant view
through this window where you can see down below

00:15:12.944 --> 00:15:17.010
the mountains and the valleys and the
landscapes outside. You can hear the wind blowing

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:24.376
though and battering like a heavy, deep whistle.
Oh! And we have the rest of our party. Perfect

00:15:24.376 --> 00:15:25.686
timing. Welcome.

00:15:25.686 --> 00:15:29.928
SAM: Okay, we'll start from announcements again.

00:15:29.928 --> 00:15:34.131
LIAM: I did a very good job with merchandise.

00:15:34.131 --> 00:15:40.402
LAURA: Did you? What did you say about
merchandise?

00:15:40.575 --> 00:15:44.147
SAM: He didn't say anything, but he did a great
impression of you.

00:15:44.147 --> 00:15:52.106
LAURA: Cool. Sorry about that.

00:15:52.106 --> 00:15:56.801
SAM: A professional is on time, Laura.

00:15:56.801 --> 00:16:00.444
TRAVIS: It was actually up to me to remember, and
I didn't. She was closest to home.

00:16:00.444 --> 00:16:10.059
MATT: So thank you, Laura. As you all stand on the
outside of the opening of this titan ingress, the

00:16:10.059 --> 00:16:16.590
slick stone steps that break off and crumble into
the open expanse where you can plummet hundreds of

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:21.613
feet to your death, should you slip. Keyleth is
holding the water at bay, keeping the flow from

00:16:21.613 --> 00:16:27.835
pushing you all back outside of the large earth
entity. Gathering your strength, you watch as

00:16:27.835 --> 00:16:34.046
J'mon Sa Ord's brass dragon form flies just
outside of your visual range. You now all stand

00:16:34.046 --> 00:16:39.208
within this 15-foot-wide entryway. What do you
do?

00:16:39.208 --> 00:16:45.078
TALIESIN: Is there a passage so we can get out of
the flow of the water, once it's been released?

00:16:45.078 --> 00:16:51.503
MATT: Currently, the flow mostly covers about ten
to 15 feet of this opening. It flows downward.

00:16:51.503 --> 00:16:56.799
It's not super strong, but it's enough where it
would be somewhat dangerous to some of you.

00:16:56.799 --> 00:16:59.810
However, Keyleth is keeping it at bay for as long
as she can concentrate.

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:04.403
LIAM: If she weren't controlling it, would there
still be, even though it's dangerous, some air?

00:17:04.403 --> 00:17:11.822
MATT: Yeah. It may be up to your knees as far as
the flow. It's a possible slip, and you're

00:17:11.822 --> 00:17:14.931
fighting the current to push you outside of the
titan.

00:17:14.931 --> 00:17:24.091
MARISHA: It's concentration up to ten minutes, so
let's move quickly.

00:17:24.091 --> 00:17:27.334
SAM: So we're going in? Into the giant?

00:17:27.334 --> 00:17:29.951
TALIESIN: Well, it's either that or back out.

00:17:29.951 --> 00:17:34.082
LAURA: Do I still have Pass Without a Trace on
us?

00:17:34.082 --> 00:17:41.527
MATT: You haven't lost concentration on it, so I
imagine so. What's the marching order, by the way?

00:17:41.527 --> 00:17:43.423
LIAM: I'll be up front.

00:17:43.423 --> 00:17:46.301
MATT: All right, we have Vax up front. Who's
next?

00:17:46.301 --> 00:17:50.673
MARISHA: I'll be behind Vax, since we touched down
first, I guess.

00:17:50.673 --> 00:17:52.771
MATT: All right, Keyleth's after Vax. Who's next?

00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:55.358
LAURA: I will be behind them.

00:17:55.358 --> 00:17:57.761
MATT: All right. Is Trinket still in your
necklace?

00:17:57.761 --> 00:18:00.043
LAURA: Yeah, I'm bamfing him out right now.

00:18:00.043 --> 00:18:04.188
MATT: Okay. Trinket is out, next to you. Who's
after Vex?

00:18:04.188 --> 00:18:07.237
SAM: I will be lucky Pierre, right in the middle.

00:18:07.237 --> 00:18:10.378
LIAM: Pike will walk right in front of Grog.

00:18:10.378 --> 00:18:12.243
TRAVIS: I'll be the caboose.

00:18:12.243 --> 00:18:16.186
TALIESIN: I'll be between Pike and Grog, right
there.

00:18:16.186 --> 00:18:25.025
MATT: Okay. Good to know. Slick steps across the
smooth stone walkway. The water, however, being

00:18:25.025 --> 00:18:29.837
kept at bay by Keyleth. You watch as this river is
being curled back into itself. The flow is being

00:18:29.837 --> 00:18:37.104
staunched. It's briefly frozen in time. It's a
unique thing to see, especially as there is no

00:18:37.104 --> 00:18:43.665
light source inside, so you can see, especially
those of you with darkvision, the flow and the

00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:48.962
movement. It swirls back on itself and seems to be
contained in that space. As you push up, bits of

00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:52.558
it splash and trickle out to the side, but for the
most part you maintain complete control of this flow.

00:18:52.558 --> 00:18:59.992
As you continue up the cracked stone stairs,
there's a slight right curvature up into this

00:18:59.992 --> 00:19:06.365
shaded area. The roof of this opening is maybe ten
feet tall. It dips down, with some of the rough

00:19:06.365 --> 00:19:13.326
rock outside and ceiling area of this, to about
seven to six feet. Grog, you have to dip down a

00:19:13.326 --> 00:19:19.245
few times. You see hints of stalactites that you
have to maneuver around and push through. It's not

00:19:19.245 --> 00:19:24.429
a huge opening, and it seems to vary in its size.
With each heavy footfall, you have to catch

00:19:24.429 --> 00:19:30.905
yourself on the wall as the impact and the shake,
the (crashing) of each step of the titan you're

00:19:30.905 --> 00:19:38.360
within seems to cause you to shift slightly, and a
faint bit of dust be released from the tunnel

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.674
around you.

00:19:39.674 --> 00:19:47.239
LIAM: Because we don't know what part of this is
the titan's butt and earth, but some of it could

00:19:47.239 --> 00:19:51.256
have been made by cannibal dwarves at some point,
I'm going to assume I'm looking for traps and

00:19:51.256 --> 00:19:54.048
listening for undead cannibal dwarves.

00:19:54.048 --> 00:19:56.776
MATT: Okay, so you're taking a very slow
approach.

00:19:56.776 --> 00:20:02.506
MARISHA: Actually, that's a good point. Does this
look like it was carved by man from cannibal

00:20:02.506 --> 00:20:06.126
dwarves, or nature-made?

00:20:06.126 --> 00:20:07.813
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:20:07.813 --> 00:20:09.518
MARISHA: Investigation, or nature check?

00:20:09.518 --> 00:20:12.956
MATT: This would not be a nature check.

00:20:12.956 --> 00:20:23.281
MARISHA: My better one? That doesn't count. No,
nope. Four total.

00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:31.907
MATT: Much of this tunnel seems to be natural
cavern, but there were steps when you first came

00:20:31.907 --> 00:20:36.613
in. There were stone steps that were carved or
placed within the dirt that eventually were

00:20:36.613 --> 00:20:45.381
consumed or covered by silt and loose earth and
whatever the river knocked loose and began to flow

00:20:45.381 --> 00:20:50.576
over it. So you can see both. A lot of this is
natural, but there seem to be, at least in the 30

00:20:50.576 --> 00:21:00.555
or 40 feet you've made into the tunnel, you've
seen elements of civilization, of crafted entry,

00:21:00.555 --> 00:21:03.149
that merge with the terrain.

00:21:03.149 --> 00:21:09.104
MARISHA: Did we get a time frame of how long ago
this crypt was built before? How old this crypt

00:21:09.104 --> 00:21:10.162
has been around?

00:21:10.162 --> 00:21:17.049
MATT: Early Age of Arcanum, so best estimate from
what you knew, you guys both learning of the

00:21:17.049 --> 00:21:22.944
history of this, well over 1,500 years, if not
longer.

00:21:22.944 --> 00:21:28.915
SAM: Before the great war thing?

00:21:28.915 --> 00:21:32.489
MATT: After the Founding, which was the first
great war, where the titans were slaughtered.

00:21:32.489 --> 00:21:37.225
Beginning of the Age of Arcanum, which was long
before the Divergence.

00:21:37.225 --> 00:21:46.424
TRAVIS: Can I touch the ground, now that we're in
the titan? I'm thinking maybe this might be where

00:21:46.424 --> 00:21:50.269
the Knuckles are from. Can I touch it and see if
the oven mitts do anything?

00:21:50.269 --> 00:22:00.682
MATT: Their general, faint vibration never stops.
There's a perpetual, very minute hum to them.

00:22:00.682 --> 00:22:06.877
Touching it doesn't seem to have any effect or
change. The proximity seems to be triggering some

00:22:06.877 --> 00:22:08.922
sort of harmonization.

00:22:08.922 --> 00:22:19.058
TRAVIS: I reach up and touch my Adam's apple and
(vibrating) this place is crazy. Sorry. No, you

00:22:19.058 --> 00:22:21.371
wouldn't do it? I thought you would.

00:22:21.371 --> 00:22:27.573
MATT: All right, so make an investigation check,
Vax, as you slowly lead the group up this slightly

00:22:27.573 --> 00:22:29.236
curving tunnel.

00:22:29.236 --> 00:22:34.801
LIAM: That is a 27.

00:22:34.801 --> 00:22:36.718
MATT: 27, okay.

00:22:36.718 --> 00:22:39.331
LAURA: I didn't get to sort them.

00:22:39.331 --> 00:22:41.049
MATT: Well, you should do that now.

00:22:41.049 --> 00:22:44.560
TALIESIN: Chaos. Introducing chaos.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:52.254
MATT: As you guys slowly make your way along the
path, behind Vax, you look out and occasionally

00:22:52.254 --> 00:22:58.769
see bits of loose earth that looks looser than
most. As you brush it aside, you can see the steps

00:22:58.769 --> 00:23:05.747
continue. A lot of it's been buried, but this was
a staircase that slowly ascended and curved. The

00:23:05.747 --> 00:23:10.675
movement of the titan seems to have knocked a lot
of the loose tunnel to cover it. As you brush it

00:23:10.675 --> 00:23:18.925
aside, you carefully look about, and you can see
that there are occasional symbols of a writing you

00:23:18.925 --> 00:23:23.685
don't understand, but nothing stands out to you as
a trap or a trigger.

00:23:23.685 --> 00:23:26.560
MARISHA: Does it look familiar to any of us?

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.323
MATT: What languages do you guys know?

00:23:28.323 --> 00:23:35.200
TRAVIS: Why are you even looking over here? I know
stick figures. I know charades.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.577
MATT: Do any of you know Dwarven?

00:23:38.577 --> 00:23:43.457
LAURA: You can read Dwarven now! You can read now,
Grog. You can read four- to five-letter words.

00:23:43.457 --> 00:23:46.730
TRAVIS: I can read Dwarven because of the belt.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:50.241
SAM: But only tiny bits.

00:23:50.241 --> 00:23:52.424
TRAVIS: Yeah, I might fuck up the bigger pieces.

00:23:52.424 --> 00:24:02.282
MATT: Grog, as Vax points out some of these
symbols, you sit there and concentrate really hard

00:24:02.282 --> 00:24:10.865
on one of the carvings in the recently uncovered
stone step. As you focus, you begin to sound out

00:24:10.865 --> 00:24:20.399
the sound to yourself repeatedly. (hesitant
syllables) You're trying to find the right way to

00:24:20.399 --> 00:24:21.541
pronounce it.

00:24:21.541 --> 00:24:25.023
TRAVIS: Baa-ram-ewe. Babe, anyone?

00:24:25.023 --> 00:24:32.319
MATT: It takes you about two to three minutes to
sound this out, which knocks about two to three

00:24:32.319 --> 00:24:42.679
minutes off of your concentration time for your
Control Water spell. But this looks to be carved

00:24:42.679 --> 00:24:44.874
in as a warning.

00:24:44.874 --> 00:24:48.975
TRAVIS: Du. Du hast. Du hast mich.

00:24:48.975 --> 00:24:54.235
(laughter)

00:24:54.235 --> 00:24:58.758
MATT: Strangely, if you could have seen Thomara
when it was a highly functioning society, they

00:24:58.758 --> 00:25:02.045
would have been blasting Rammstein everywhere,
man.

00:25:02.045 --> 00:25:05.602
LIAM: Speak Rammstein and enter.

00:25:05.602 --> 00:25:14.175
MATT: Yeah, these weren't the happy-go-lucky
dwarves of old. This was a brutal clan.

00:25:14.175 --> 00:25:18.156
TRAVIS: It looks like a warning of some kind.

00:25:18.156 --> 00:25:23.762
MATT: The rough translation from what you can--
spending about five minutes or so breaking out

00:25:23.762 --> 00:25:33.781
this glyph and a few other glyphs, it says,
"Leave. Death here. No further."

00:25:33.781 --> 00:25:50.897
TRAVIS: Right, it says, "Leaves, death here, no
further." So leaves, death here, leaves of death

00:25:50.897 --> 00:25:55.674
here, but no further. I'm still working it out.

00:25:55.674 --> 00:26:01.114
SAM: Maybe it's "no fur." Maybe we should leave
Trinket. I'm just saying, that's the furriest one.

00:26:01.114 --> 00:26:02.921
I don't want Trinket to die.

00:26:02.921 --> 00:26:05.851
LAURA: Thanks, Scanlan.

00:26:05.851 --> 00:26:12.805
MARISHA: I feel like we already knew so much of
that.

00:26:12.805 --> 00:26:18.323
TRAVIS: I've been working really hard. That was
five minutes of the most concentration I've ever

00:26:18.323 --> 00:26:22.366
given to one thing in my life. Thanks.

00:26:22.366 --> 00:26:26.155
MARISHA: Okay, let's get up this river before I
lose concentration.

00:26:26.155 --> 00:26:39.767
MATT: You push up another 60 or so feet, Vax still
keeping the point man on this. Slowly pulling

00:26:39.767 --> 00:26:48.421
forward, you begin to hear the sound of rushing
water growing louder and louder. You eventually

00:26:48.421 --> 00:26:52.831
come across the rift in the ceiling that is
spilling forth the water that is forming this

00:26:52.831 --> 00:26:59.194
river. It looks like there is a recent crack and a
piece of eroded earth that has fallen out from

00:26:59.194 --> 00:27:06.454
some sort of water source further up inside the
titan that is causing this river to continuously

00:27:06.454 --> 00:27:09.200
run in and out of this titan.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:16.453
SAM: How does this work? How much water could a
titan hold?

00:27:16.453 --> 00:27:18.606
MARISHA: Well, this thing is massive.

00:27:18.606 --> 00:27:22.953
SAM: I know, but is there a barrel of water in his
chest?

00:27:22.953 --> 00:27:27.425
MARISHA: Maybe a lake? An underground lake?

00:27:27.425 --> 00:27:34.017
TALIESIN: We're always impressed by how much water
comes out of &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.

00:27:34.017 --> 00:27:43.152
MATT: At this point, you guys would be able to
move around and continue up past where this

00:27:43.152 --> 00:27:46.479
opening is, and the river would no longer be
impeding your path.

00:27:46.479 --> 00:27:51.822
LAURA: Let's do that. Keep moving up, right?
That's where the city is.

00:27:51.822 --> 00:27:53.235
SAM: Sure.

00:27:53.235 --> 00:28:00.005
MARISHA: Hang on. Can I do a nature check? Is
there anything weird about this?

00:28:00.005 --> 00:28:06.420
LAURA: While she's doing a nature check, I want to
do Primeval Awareness and sense undead in the

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:11.830
area. Within a mile of me.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:20.415
MATT: Okay. &lt;i&gt;Many&lt;/i&gt;.

00:28:20.415 --> 00:28:23.825
LAURA: Within the mile?

00:28:23.825 --> 00:28:33.313
MATT: Within a mile, which is the entirety of the
titan, many. Thousands.

00:28:33.313 --> 00:28:39.767
TRAVIS: But they're probably in inoperable
pieces.

00:28:39.767 --> 00:28:43.769
LAURA: Are they all above us or are some near us?

00:28:43.769 --> 00:28:48.724
MATT: Nothing within the very immediate vicinity. Due
to the limitations of Primeval Awareness, which

00:28:48.724 --> 00:28:56.159
does not show you the exact location, you sense
the presence and vague direction. Forward and

00:28:56.159 --> 00:29:04.060
upward, there is this giant mass of undead force
that the minute you focus, it causes you to hold

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:09.500
your breath. As soon as the impact hits you, you
have to remind yourself to exhale.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:15.679
SAM: But maybe they're all hypnotized or
something.

00:29:15.679 --> 00:29:18.042
MARISHA: 17?

00:29:18.042 --> 00:29:23.951
MATT: Okay. The structural damage appears to be
natural. As you pay attention and watch as another

00:29:23.951 --> 00:29:29.906
footfall of the titan hits (crashing) and it
shakes, you watch as another piece of rock falls

00:29:29.906 --> 00:29:34.769
and a little of the water flow expands to allow a
little more water to exit. You get the sense that,

00:29:34.769 --> 00:29:37.766
as the titan moves, the longer it travels--

00:29:37.766 --> 00:29:39.950
MARISHA: The more it's going to fall apart?

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:45.822
MATT: Or at least portions of it that were built
into the titan, that aren't part of its natural body--

00:29:45.822 --> 00:29:47.371
MARISHA: Start to crumble?

00:29:47.371 --> 00:29:48.765
MATT: Some of them may.

00:29:48.765 --> 00:29:50.981
LAURA: What if we Earthquake the titan?

00:29:50.981 --> 00:29:52.371
SAM: To do what?

00:29:52.371 --> 00:29:54.084
LAURA: To fucking fall apart!

00:29:54.084 --> 00:29:55.556
SAM: But we're in it.

00:29:55.556 --> 00:29:58.153
LAURA: Yeah, but we could take out the entire
city.

00:29:58.153 --> 00:29:59.559
SAM: We're in it!

00:29:59.559 --> 00:30:02.231
TALIESIN: Last time we did that, it kept floating
up top.

00:30:02.231 --> 00:30:06.976
LAURA: But it couldn't move for a while.

00:30:06.976 --> 00:30:11.830
MARISHA: We have to get to the top. This thing is
too big. I don't think my Earthquake will do enough.

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.053
LIAM: It's in the grab bag. It's an option.

00:30:14.053 --> 00:30:19.601
TRAVIS: If we're inside the GI tract of this titan
and we give it an Earthquake, is it basically like

00:30:19.601 --> 00:30:26.671
a big old dead titan fart?

00:30:26.671 --> 00:30:32.749
LAURA: Potentially. It could shit out a lot of
dwarven zombies.

00:30:32.749 --> 00:30:35.645
TALIESIN: It is also an option if we do get
overrun.

00:30:35.645 --> 00:30:37.527
TRAVIS: True.

00:30:37.527 --> 00:30:40.346
MARISHA: Did you learn it today, Pike?

00:30:40.346 --> 00:30:42.662
LAURA: "Yeah."

00:30:42.662 --> 00:30:45.338
SAM: Oh, we're playing Pike?

00:30:45.338 --> 00:30:47.197
LIAM: We're playing Pike.

00:30:47.197 --> 00:30:48.599
SAM: You two?

00:30:48.599 --> 00:30:50.418
LIAM: We are. We're the Pike jaegers.

00:30:50.418 --> 00:30:51.980
SAM: Okay.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.940
LAURA: Mostly Liam.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:59.317
LIAM: You can do the impression, and I will sort
through the pages.

00:30:59.317 --> 00:31:05.534
MATT: There you go. As you guys descend past the
rushing water, the sound of the river begins to

00:31:05.534 --> 00:31:14.025
slowly fade behind you as you continue to spiral
upward, this slow crawling, ascending tunnel. The

00:31:14.025 --> 00:31:21.250
dirt that consumes the stairs at your feet
eventually begins to give away as your feet find

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:27.857
purchase in softer earth from loose gravel and the
rocky terrain. As you continue to push further and

00:31:27.857 --> 00:31:37.486
further into the interior of this titan, you feel
another heavy impacting footfall, and all of you

00:31:37.486 --> 00:31:45.402
have to brace yourself against the nearby wall,
this impact seeming heavier than others, and as it

00:31:45.402 --> 00:31:48.358
does, a number of rocks tumble past.

00:31:48.358 --> 00:31:50.716
LAURA: What do you think he just did? Do you think
he just fell?

00:31:50.716 --> 00:31:52.239
SAM: Maybe?

00:31:52.239 --> 00:31:54.758
TALIESIN: I think he swung at something.

00:31:54.758 --> 00:32:03.315
MATT: Another footfall.

00:32:03.315 --> 00:32:18.659
Another footfall. Every single hit seems to cause
the foreign structures on the inside to-- hope

00:32:18.659 --> 00:32:26.797
that they were made well. Another heavy footfall
hits even heavier than the last, and this one, the

00:32:26.797 --> 00:32:30.492
impact hits so hard that you guys are almost
thrown to your knees as you reach out, and you

00:32:30.492 --> 00:32:39.524
hear this loud crack sound above you. I need
Scanlan, Pike, Percival, and Grog to make a

00:32:39.524 --> 00:32:41.221
dexterity saving throw, please.

00:32:41.221 --> 00:32:42.909
SAM: Dex, huh?

00:32:42.909 --> 00:32:44.263
MATT: Yep.

00:32:44.263 --> 00:32:49.556
LIAM: Pike needs to do it too, right?

00:32:49.556 --> 00:32:51.102
MATT: Yep.

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:56.217
TRAVIS: Natural 20. Gil coming in in the clutch!

00:32:56.217 --> 00:32:59.243
TALIESIN: 15.

00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:01.086
SAM: 13.

00:33:01.086 --> 00:33:03.211
LIAM: 13 for the other gnome.

00:33:03.211 --> 00:33:12.699
MATT: All right. Everyone but Grog, you glance up
just in time to watch as a large piece of the

00:33:12.699 --> 00:33:19.009
tunnel ceiling dislodges and comes plummeting down
in your direction. Grog, you dive out of the way,

00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:23.720
being clipped off the shoulder, but you manage to
avoid most of the impact. The rest of you,

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:31.725
however, immediately get buried by rock and broken
earth, suffering 29 points of bludgeoning damage

00:33:31.725 --> 00:33:36.830
to Percival, Pike, and Scanlan. And they are
buried and restrained right now,

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:38.415
unable to breathe.

00:33:38.415 --> 00:33:44.503
TRAVIS: I go over and I start-- boulders, dirt,
everything.

00:33:44.503 --> 00:33:50.908
MATT: Between all of you guys able to help, it's a
negligible period of time, and it wasn't too heavy

00:33:50.908 --> 00:33:55.891
of an impact. You manage to get them free over the
next five or so minutes. They get their breath

00:33:55.891 --> 00:34:02.277
back. A bit battered, but you get the sense that
you should travel quickly.

00:34:02.277 --> 00:34:06.630
LAURA: We'll keep going quickly, then.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:14.231
MATT: Picking up the pace, you continue up the
curvature of the upward ascension. It's probably

00:34:14.231 --> 00:34:23.283
been about 60 or 70 feet since you've seen any
carved portion of terrain, any sign of previous

00:34:23.283 --> 00:34:31.809
dwarven construct or building or architecture. As
the tunnel stops at the curve, it eventually,

00:34:31.809 --> 00:34:39.423
looking ahead, ascends a bit, about a ten-foot
climb up onto a plateau of some kind. You can see

00:34:39.423 --> 00:34:46.084
some weird root-like tree is growing out of one
wall and seems to be dead and petrified in its

00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:49.730
current space. Do you guys wish to ascend to the
plateau?

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:51.738
LAURA: We probably should, right?

00:34:51.738 --> 00:34:53.207
LIAM: How far away is it?

00:34:53.207 --> 00:34:55.538
MATT: It's about 40 feet from you right now.

00:34:55.538 --> 00:34:58.626
LIAM: I'm going to creep up 20 feet in front of
everybody else.

00:34:58.626 --> 00:35:02.988
LAURA: I want to go with him. I need to keep an
eye out for the zombie dwarves.

00:35:02.988 --> 00:35:08.707
LIAM: Divine Sense, which is specific to undead
location, not vague, if there's any within 60

00:35:08.707 --> 00:35:10.167
feet. I'll use one.

00:35:10.167 --> 00:35:13.785
MATT: Okay. Focusing, no undead within 60 feet of
you.

00:35:13.785 --> 00:35:15.635
LAURA: That's good.

00:35:15.635 --> 00:35:20.644
SAM: I drank a tiny little potion of healing. I
healed six.

00:35:20.644 --> 00:35:21.981
MATT: Good job!

00:35:21.981 --> 00:35:25.234
LIAM: So it's leading up to a plateau?

00:35:25.234 --> 00:35:30.176
MATT: Yeah, it goes up about ten or so feet, 15
feet up, and then it leads to another plateau, and

00:35:30.176 --> 00:35:31.540
you can't see beyond that.

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.971
LIAM: I'm going to scuttle up and look over.

00:35:33.971 --> 00:35:36.776
MATT: Okay. Are you stealthing? Roll a stealth
check.

00:35:36.776 --> 00:35:38.831
LAURA: Add ten to it!

00:35:38.831 --> 00:35:45.339
MATT: Vex, are you going with him or letting him
scout ahead?

00:35:45.339 --> 00:35:49.494
LAURA: I crawled up, but then, once he took off
again, then I stayed.

00:35:49.494 --> 00:35:51.808
MATT: Okay.

00:35:51.808 --> 00:35:53.265
LIAM: 41.

00:35:53.265 --> 00:35:54.771
MATT: 41. Okay, cool.

00:35:54.771 --> 00:35:56.240
TRAVIS: 41?

00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:00.134
LIAM: This is old news, guys. This is old news.
This is what I get to do.

00:36:00.134 --> 00:36:01.967
TRAVIS: It seems new to me every time.

00:36:01.967 --> 00:36:06.743
MATT: All right. You ascend to the top of this
plateau. It only goes on for about 15 feet, and

00:36:06.743 --> 00:36:11.259
then descends down into another chamber that
splits in two different directions. A tunnel that

00:36:11.259 --> 00:36:16.516
goes to the right and to the left. You can see,
once again, the stalactites, some of them meeting

00:36:16.516 --> 00:36:21.404
in the center with the stalagmites to form
pillars. You can see portions of the wall that

00:36:21.404 --> 00:36:29.321
have collapsed and created these soft landslides
in one corner to the right of you. But currently,

00:36:29.321 --> 00:36:33.479
all you see is the descending tunnel and then the
split, and you can't see too far

00:36:33.479 --> 00:36:35.003
one way or the other.

00:36:35.003 --> 00:36:42.172
LIAM: Yeah. I turn around to group, and do like
a-- And then I go down over, stealthing along the way.

00:36:42.172 --> 00:36:45.237
MATT: Okay. Anyone else? What are you doing?

00:36:45.237 --> 00:36:46.584
LAURA: I guess we follow.

00:36:46.584 --> 00:36:49.775
SAM: What did this mean? Did this mean we were
supposed to follow him and split up?

00:36:49.775 --> 00:36:52.232
LAURA: I think that means that there's a split in
the path.

00:36:52.232 --> 00:36:54.843
SAM: Let's split up, anyway.

00:36:54.843 --> 00:36:58.049
LAURA: Scanlan, you go one way, and we'll go the
other.

00:36:58.049 --> 00:37:04.947
MATT: Okay, so as the rest of you ascend to the
top of the plateau, you make your way down to the

00:37:04.947 --> 00:37:09.604
center, and you can see that the path goes to the
right and the left. Both seem fairly identical,

00:37:09.604 --> 00:37:11.661
though they're traveling in opposite directions.

00:37:11.661 --> 00:37:16.893
TALIESIN: We entered in the left side of the
body?

00:37:16.893 --> 00:37:23.548
MATT: If you were to look at it straight on, like
it's facing you, it would be the right side.

00:37:23.548 --> 00:37:25.554
LAURA: If it's facing us.

00:37:25.554 --> 00:37:26.770
MATT: Correct.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:28.662
MARISHA: So our right, its left.

00:37:28.662 --> 00:37:31.294
LAURA: No. Its right, our left.

00:37:31.294 --> 00:37:33.570
TALIESIN: Looking at its butt.

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:36.122
MATT: If you're looking at its butt, to the
right.

00:37:36.122 --> 00:37:42.076
TALIESIN: All right, to the right leg. So if we
split, we probably want to keep to the core of it.

00:37:42.076 --> 00:37:45.926
MARISHA: So go left? To the left.

00:37:45.926 --> 00:37:49.800
SAM: That is a decision, sure.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:54.181
TALIESIN: We'll check, obviously, for air
currents.

00:37:54.181 --> 00:38:05.845
MATT: At which point, there is what sounds like an
explosion of rock and dirt immediately to the left

00:38:05.845 --> 00:38:14.130
of Percival as two heavy, rock-like limbs reach
out, grab, and pull him against the wall as the

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:20.022
ceiling crumples over and collapses. He has now
vanished within the wall, and now leaving a pile

00:38:20.022 --> 00:38:22.442
of rock in his place.

00:38:22.442 --> 00:38:25.233
LAURA: Percy! Keyleth! Keyleth, dig him out!

00:38:25.233 --> 00:38:29.272
MATT: Darkness. And you're now restrained, and
there is no air.

00:38:29.272 --> 00:38:31.109
LAURA: I start clawing at the wall where he was.

00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:35.737
MATT: You start clawing it. At this point, with
the alertness piqued up between you two and

00:38:35.737 --> 00:38:40.692
Keyleth, you glance around and you can see things
emerging out of the nearby walls. Like the rocks

00:38:40.692 --> 00:38:43.182
themselves are almost pushing through.

00:38:43.182 --> 00:38:51.005
MARISHA: I say, get to the middle, stay away from
the walls! And I cast Transmute Rock, right in the

00:38:51.005 --> 00:38:55.880
space where he went, and I reach my hands in and
try and grab him out of mud.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.130
MATT: Okay.

00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:00.150
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a 3rd-level spell.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:05.217
TRAVIS: Have you ever transmuted anything before?

00:39:05.217 --> 00:39:08.153
MARISHA: I've done it once before, and it didn't
work very well.

00:39:08.153 --> 00:39:15.103
MATT: So as you do that, this entire section of
the wall (squishing) turns to a heavy, soft mud

00:39:15.103 --> 00:39:21.145
material, and your arms plunge into it, and you
feel, and you grab Percival, and pull him out.

00:39:21.145 --> 00:39:29.018
You're covered in thick, sludgy mud, and as he's
pulled out, you guys glance around and you can

00:39:29.018 --> 00:39:34.630
see, shifting in the darkness, the walls in
certain places seem to almost move. I need you all

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:37.528
to roll initiative.

00:39:37.528 --> 00:39:44.113
MARISHA: We're fighting walls! First doors, now
walls!

00:39:44.113 --> 00:39:50.805
SAM: Wow! We're already at a battle map!

00:39:50.805 --> 00:39:59.938
TRAVIS: I know aquariums that don't look that
good.

00:39:59.938 --> 00:40:08.103
MATT: Percival, you're pulled into this side
there. Keyleth had just pulled you out there. Vex

00:40:08.103 --> 00:40:10.564
and Trinket.

00:40:10.564 --> 00:40:13.982
LAURA: I would be closer to Percy than Trinket
is.

00:40:13.982 --> 00:40:21.633
MATT: That's true. You were scrambling at the
wall, so that will be Trinket over there.

00:40:21.633 --> 00:40:28.308
LIAM: I was, as well. The twins were scrabbling at
the rock.

00:40:28.308 --> 00:40:35.536
MATT: All right. And that being the case, then,
you guys are all clustered up in that platform.

00:40:35.536 --> 00:40:37.046
LAURA: No!

00:40:37.046 --> 00:40:42.256
LIAM: Wait. Matt, wait.

00:40:42.256 --> 00:40:47.881
TRAVIS: (robotically) The walk sign is on.

00:40:47.881 --> 00:40:55.170
MATT: You watch as these creatures that are
similar to the living earth physicality of the

00:40:55.170 --> 00:41:00.328
titan and/or the elemental form that Keyleth has
taken in the past seem to emerge, but where their

00:41:00.328 --> 00:41:07.492
once glowing elemental eyes are, there's a vacuous
darkness. You feel the rumble of the ground as

00:41:07.492 --> 00:41:10.328
they shift and glide through the rock in their
vicinity.

00:41:10.328 --> 00:41:17.811
MARISHA: Oh, they're undead necromantic elemental
earth ellies?

00:41:17.811 --> 00:41:21.270
MATT: They're not undead, because you do not sense
undead in the presence.

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:32.127
LAURA: Wait. Oh no! You guys, guess what we didn't
do? We didn't have a feast.

00:41:32.127 --> 00:41:39.746
SAM: Well, how were we going to have a feast? We
were in a big board meeting and then we came here.

00:41:39.746 --> 00:41:47.670
MATT: So getting initiative orders here. All
right, 25 to 20?

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:49.017
TALIESIN: 21.

00:41:49.017 --> 00:41:50.512
TRAVIS: Same thing.

00:41:50.512 --> 00:41:52.126
LAURA: 21 as well.

00:41:52.126 --> 00:42:04.588
MATT: Jeez. All right. 20 to 15?

00:42:04.588 --> 00:42:05.754
LIAM: 19.

00:42:05.754 --> 00:42:07.138
SAM: 18!

00:42:07.138 --> 00:42:17.875
MATT: All right. 15 to ten? Ten to five?

00:42:17.875 --> 00:42:19.513
MARISHA: Eight.

00:42:19.513 --> 00:42:21.964
LIAM: Pike rolled a one.

00:42:21.964 --> 00:42:30.312
MATT: Got it. Top of the round, Percival. As you
emerge, covered in the sludge, you look around

00:42:30.312 --> 00:42:36.755
you. By the way, right now, you have no vision
because nobody lit a torch. I should remember

00:42:36.755 --> 00:42:44.591
that. You are a human. You have no common sight.
We'll say for the purposes of this, you had a

00:42:44.591 --> 00:42:47.512
torch out, so you could see.

00:42:47.512 --> 00:42:49.964
TALIESIN: I might have been using my flashlight, I
would imagine.

00:42:49.964 --> 00:42:53.861
LIAM: Does Pike's Mace of Disruption always shed
bright light for 20 feet?

00:42:53.861 --> 00:43:01.109
MATT: When she chooses to. However, as soon as you
were pulled into the wall and then dragged back

00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:05.737
out, and the whole surface of it is coated, you
were seeing darkness. In your turn, you are

00:43:05.737 --> 00:43:07.119
blinded right now.

00:43:07.119 --> 00:43:08.320
TALIESIN: I'm blinded?

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:11.108
MATT: Yes, because you can't see anything around
you. All you hear is the moving and shifting of

00:43:11.108 --> 00:43:13.532
rock and your allies all preparing for some sort
of assault.

00:43:13.532 --> 00:43:21.120
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend my turn removing the
mud from my eyes, and I think I still have a

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.554
charge in my flashlight, at this point.

00:43:23.554 --> 00:43:26.848
MATT: You can't, though. It is covered in muck and
mud.

00:43:26.848 --> 00:43:29.803
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend my bonus action
clearing that and then--

00:43:29.803 --> 00:43:33.877
MATT: We'll say it'll take your whole turn to
clear yourself and to clear the light from that,

00:43:33.877 --> 00:43:39.769
so there you go. At that point, the light at the
front of your weapon lights up, illuminates the

00:43:39.769 --> 00:43:44.892
vicinity, and you see the moving shadows are bits
of rock and stone, moving, living out of the

00:43:44.892 --> 00:43:46.388
nearby walls.

00:43:46.388 --> 00:43:48.479
LAURA: How do we fight rocks?

00:43:48.479 --> 00:43:54.737
MARISHA: I'm about to tell you. Be careful. They
can go into the walls and earth glide, so watch

00:43:54.737 --> 00:43:55.903
your feet.

00:43:55.903 --> 00:43:57.771
MATT: Percival, you can move if you want to.

00:43:57.771 --> 00:44:00.963
TALIESIN: Yeah. Is there one right next to me
right now?

00:44:00.963 --> 00:44:04.801
MATT: There's one maybe ten feet from you.

00:44:04.801 --> 00:44:10.017
TALIESIN: I'm going to hop over by the little pool
fountain. I'm going to back up and get out of this

00:44:10.017 --> 00:44:11.739
clump of people.

00:44:11.739 --> 00:44:15.376
LAURA: That sounded like you were casting a
spell.

00:44:15.376 --> 00:44:23.188
MARISHA: They're vulnerable to thunder damage,
anything vibrate-y, because rocks.

00:44:23.188 --> 00:44:32.256
MATT: Which you will find out-- I'll say that
you're yelling that as everyone is preparing. That

00:44:32.256 --> 00:44:36.955
finishes Percival's turn. Grog, you're up.

00:44:36.955 --> 00:44:43.222
TRAVIS: I would like to rage. I would like to spin
around 180 degrees, and I would like to attack

00:44:43.222 --> 00:44:46.683
Clayface right about there.

00:44:46.683 --> 00:44:49.200
MATT: Okay, go for it.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.974
TRAVIS: Shit Stain is down at the bottom of the
stairs. Reckless!

00:44:52.974 --> 00:44:54.663
MATT: Go for it.

00:44:54.663 --> 00:45:01.400
SAM: Great Weapon Master! Assassinate! Uncanny
rage!

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.009
TRAVIS: 28.

00:45:03.009 --> 00:45:04.671
MATT: 28 hits.

00:45:04.671 --> 00:45:19.359
TRAVIS: Okay. Oh, I reroll ones and twos. Nice! 22
plus one point of necrotic. 23 points of damage.

00:45:19.359 --> 00:45:23.589
MATT: 23 points of damage in the first hit. As you
spin around, jaw open, growling in rage (yells),

00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:28.641
you bring the axe across, and it cuts across the
front of its chest. You watch as pieces of rock

00:45:28.641 --> 00:45:31.719
break off, and it still holds strong against the
impact.

00:45:31.719 --> 00:45:32.898
TRAVIS: I do it again!

00:45:32.898 --> 00:45:34.388
MATT: Go for it.

00:45:34.388 --> 00:45:41.872
TRAVIS: Reckless, Great Weapon Master this time!

00:45:41.872 --> 00:45:43.254
25.

00:45:43.254 --> 00:45:44.749
MATT: 25 hits.

00:45:44.749 --> 00:45:51.581
TRAVIS: 31 points of damage.

00:45:51.581 --> 00:45:57.428
MATT: Nice! The second hit, you swing around and
slam it. It actually gets stuck and wedged in part

00:45:57.428 --> 00:46:05.930
of its body. The mouth opens and gives this
guttural (grunts) as a reaction. Actually giving a

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:10.467
pain exert upon the hit. However, as it reaches
out, both of its hands grab the edge of the axe.

00:46:10.467 --> 00:46:12.888
All right. That end your turn?

00:46:12.888 --> 00:46:15.169
TRAVIS: Is he holding my axe?

00:46:15.169 --> 00:46:16.498
MATT: He's attempting to.

00:46:16.498 --> 00:46:18.074
TRAVIS: Well, I wanted to move!

00:46:18.074 --> 00:46:19.566
MATT: Okay, then move.

00:46:19.566 --> 00:46:29.449
TRAVIS: I'm moving! I would like to go (counting)
30 feet to face off with this guy.

00:46:29.449 --> 00:46:33.568
MATT: All right. Well, that guy swings at you with
his fist as you pull away. You rip the axe out of

00:46:33.568 --> 00:46:37.429
its grasp, and instead it takes one wide swing
with its right fist.

00:46:37.429 --> 00:46:40.391
LAURA: But you slice his fingers off when he does
it!

00:46:40.391 --> 00:46:48.458
MATT: He has advantage because you used reckless.
That is a 24 to hit.

00:46:48.458 --> 00:46:59.547
TRAVIS: I have a low AC. I don't wear clothes. I
wear gauntlets and stuff. I wear skin. And tattoos.

00:46:59.547 --> 00:47:06.446
MATT: That is 18 points of bludgeoning damage,
reduced to nine. All right, that finish your turn,

00:47:06.446 --> 00:47:10.408
Grog? Vex, you're up. And you're on deck, Vax.

00:47:10.408 --> 00:47:13.356
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark.

00:47:13.356 --> 00:47:15.506
MATT: On?

00:47:15.506 --> 00:47:18.127
LAURA: On the biggest one. This one.

00:47:18.127 --> 00:47:19.772
MATT: All right.

00:47:19.772 --> 00:47:24.077
LAURA: And then I'm going to shoot him. With
sharpshooter!

00:47:24.077 --> 00:47:25.998
MATT: Go for it!

00:47:25.998 --> 00:47:37.591
LAURA: Wait, okay. Oh no. 19 minus five. 14.

00:47:37.591 --> 00:47:42.398
MATT: 14 does not hit, unfortunately. As you mark
it with your spell, you pull back the first arrow,

00:47:42.398 --> 00:47:45.954
and it hits, but it ends up exploding, the shards
of wood scattering off of it, and your hear a

00:47:45.954 --> 00:47:47.866
slight (grunts).

00:47:47.866 --> 00:47:54.395
LAURA: Yeah, you motherfucker. Okay. 16.

00:47:54.395 --> 00:48:00.279
MATT: 16 misses, just barely. You go to shoot
another arrow, this time out of frustration, as

00:48:00.279 --> 00:48:04.270
you pull back and let it loose, it actually
backhands the arrow out of the air, scattering the

00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:06.169
shaft in the middle of the sky.

00:48:06.169 --> 00:48:12.655
LAURA: Wait, I didn't say sharpshooter! I didn't
say sharpshooter on that one, did I? I didn't clarify.

00:48:12.655 --> 00:48:15.717
MATT: So without the minus five, what would it
be?

00:48:15.717 --> 00:48:17.871
LAURA: It would be 21.

00:48:17.871 --> 00:48:20.384
MATT: Okay. You didn't say it.

00:48:20.384 --> 00:48:22.611
LAURA: I should've said it, but I didn't say it.

00:48:22.611 --> 00:48:28.168
MATT: That's okay, we'll let it go. Okay, so roll
damage. Regular damage. So as it goes to backhand

00:48:28.168 --> 00:48:33.140
it out of the air, the arrow manages to sink in
the center of its fist. It still causes a crack to

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:37.292
widen across the various plates that keep its left
arm together.

00:48:37.292 --> 00:48:48.433
LAURA: 16 plus five lightning damage. And then,
since he is next to Scanlan, I get sneak attack?

00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:50.376
MATT: Correct.

00:48:50.376 --> 00:48:59.202
LAURA: Ooh, 12. 15 sneak attack! And then Hunter's
Mark, three.

00:48:59.202 --> 00:49:06.411
MATT: All right. Fantastic. 39 damage in one hit.
So the second one, as it hits, it causes this rift

00:49:06.411 --> 00:49:12.509
in the center of its large, battering ram-like arm
to shift and crack and pieces of broken shale peel

00:49:12.509 --> 00:49:15.663
and fall off to the ground around it. Does that
end your turn?

00:49:15.663 --> 00:49:16.863
LAURA: Yeah.

00:49:16.863 --> 00:49:19.522
MATT: Do you want to move, or do you want to stay
where you are?

00:49:19.522 --> 00:49:20.819
LAURA: I'm going to stay where I am.

00:49:20.819 --> 00:49:22.538
MATT: Vax, you're up.

00:49:22.538 --> 00:49:26.282
LIAM: We've been in here under an hour. Probably
not much time left, but under an hour, right?

00:49:26.282 --> 00:49:27.746
Since we arrived?

00:49:27.746 --> 00:49:29.575
MATT: Pushing close to an hour.

00:49:29.575 --> 00:49:32.130
LIAM: Okay. How high is the ceiling in this
tunnel?

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:33.345
MATT: About 12 feet.

00:49:33.345 --> 00:49:38.211
LIAM: 12 feet. I will float above everybody, in
the space above their heads. We can fudge it.

00:49:38.211 --> 00:49:50.981
Probably between Percy and Pike, if we can manage
it. And I'm going to dagger, dagger, dagger, with

00:49:50.981 --> 00:49:55.064
sharpshooter on all three, the one right below me
next to Keyleth.

00:49:55.064 --> 00:49:56.783
MATT: All righty.

00:49:56.783 --> 00:50:01.460
LIAM: Okay. The first one is a 20.

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.823
MATT: All right, that hits.

00:50:03.823 --> 00:50:16.133
LIAM: Okay. Second one is balls. And the third one
is... 20.

00:50:16.133 --> 00:50:17.863
MATT: 20 hits.

00:50:17.863 --> 00:50:23.973
LIAM: And because assassin and they haven't gone
yet-- oh, I have advantage because of assassin, so

00:50:23.973 --> 00:50:37.848
sneak attack. Also next to Keyleth. Multiple
reasons for sneak attack, so that is 11, plus

00:50:37.848 --> 00:50:56.755
psychic damage is 15. (counting) 36 for the first
one. And then the last one does a rinky-dink one.

00:50:56.755 --> 00:50:59.447
MATT: One point of damage.

00:50:59.447 --> 00:51:02.332
LIAM: Because off-hand attack doesn't get any--

00:51:02.332 --> 00:51:04.673
MATT: There's no modifier, just whatever damage
the weapon would deal.

00:51:04.673 --> 00:51:06.447
LIAM: Yeah, just one.

00:51:06.447 --> 00:51:07.580
MATT: Okay.

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:09.355
LIAM: And I'll stay floating.

00:51:09.355 --> 00:51:11.706
MATT: All right. So as you're flying there, your
wings still--

00:51:11.706 --> 00:51:13.708
LAURA: Don't you add six, though?

00:51:13.708 --> 00:51:16.716
LIAM: No modifier. That's the modifier.

00:51:16.716 --> 00:51:20.919
MATT: No dexterity modifier. It still gets weapon
bonus, damage bonus on the weapon.

00:51:20.919 --> 00:51:30.009
LIAM: That's calculated from dexterity. Oh, so
two. And 20 more for the sharpshooter.

00:51:30.009 --> 00:51:39.268
MATT: Ah, didn't add sharpshooter onto that. Keep
that in mind. As you release the torrent of

00:51:39.268 --> 00:51:44.925
daggers down, one of them slams into the chest as
another hits and skids off to the side and

00:51:44.925 --> 00:51:48.927
vanishes, and the third one actually strikes right
where the first dagger was, driving it deeper in.

00:51:48.927 --> 00:51:52.767
Both of them seem to wedge and break the interior
of its chest, and you watch as parts of its body

00:51:52.767 --> 00:51:56.772
are falling off in chunks. It's giving this
horrible sucking sound, like it's barely holding

00:51:56.772 --> 00:52:02.280
itself together. (wheezes) But there it still
stands. That ends your turn. Scanlan, you're up.

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:09.482
SAM: Okay, I will rotate around the guy with the
red ring around him so that I'm between him and

00:52:09.482 --> 00:52:11.029
his friend.

00:52:11.029 --> 00:52:15.453
MATT: Right there, you mean? Okay, you're right on
the edge. There's a platform drop-off behind you.

00:52:15.453 --> 00:52:17.066
SAM: (singing) I'm living on the edge!

00:52:17.066 --> 00:52:19.446
(laughter)

00:52:19.446 --> 00:52:21.878
MATT: As you rush over there, you're like
(grunts). You watch as a couple rocks tumble off

00:52:21.878 --> 00:52:25.008
and clatter below. Ten-foot drop; not too bad.

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:31.724
SAM: Sure. Oh. I'll inspire Grog first. Because
I'm about to hit you.

00:52:31.724 --> 00:52:32.795
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:52:32.795 --> 00:52:34.961
(laughter)

00:52:34.961 --> 00:52:41.827
SAM: I will sing, (singing) Hey now! You're a
Grog-star. Get your axe up and slay! Hey now!

00:52:41.827 --> 00:52:53.533
You're a Grog-star. Get your rage on and rage! All
Laura's dice are gold. Now a d12 can be rolled.

00:52:53.533 --> 00:52:57.742
TRAVIS: Pulled that shit out at the last minute.

00:52:57.742 --> 00:53:01.127
MATT: It came back around. All right, so take your
inspiration dice, definitely.

00:53:01.127 --> 00:53:06.612
SAM: And then I'll do a 3rd-level Thunderwave.

00:53:06.612 --> 00:53:12.134
MATT: Towards which one?

00:53:12.134 --> 00:53:20.195
SAM: Both. It's 15 feet from me. Yeah, it's from
me in a 15-foot cube.

00:53:20.195 --> 00:53:25.333
MATT: A cube? Okay, so you can put yourself in the
cube, then. Okay.

00:53:25.333 --> 00:53:27.606
TALIESIN: You may not even hit Grog, necessarily.

00:53:27.606 --> 00:53:29.226
TRAVIS: You'd better.

00:53:29.226 --> 00:53:32.894
MATT: You can do it where it doesn't hit Grog. It
just hits the other guy.

00:53:32.894 --> 00:53:34.322
SAM: That'll be nice!

00:53:34.322 --> 00:53:38.860
MATT: I'll let you do that. Out the sides of you.
All right, so that's a constitution saving throw

00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:40.251
for both of them, right?

00:53:40.251 --> 00:53:42.534
SAM: Yeah, sure. Oh shit. Yeah.

00:53:42.534 --> 00:53:48.613
MATT: Second one does save. First one does not.
Rolled a natural 20 on its saving throw. The first

00:53:48.613 --> 00:53:50.129
one rolled a five.

00:53:50.129 --> 00:53:52.667
SAM: What did the second one roll?

00:53:52.667 --> 00:53:53.948
MATT: Natural 20.

00:53:53.948 --> 00:54:04.606
SAM: Oh fuck. Okay, that does. They both take 4d8
damage, and the one who didn't make his save gets

00:54:04.606 --> 00:54:06.819
pushed away, but he's right up against the wall.

00:54:06.819 --> 00:54:10.545
MATT: So it doesn't do anything. However, it does
thunder damage, which they are vulnerable to, so

00:54:10.545 --> 00:54:11.949
they take double damage from this.

00:54:11.949 --> 00:54:13.571
SAM: Double damage?!

00:54:13.571 --> 00:54:17.944
MATT: You watch as the blast of thunder energy
slams outward. Both of them, you watch as their

00:54:17.944 --> 00:54:21.184
bodies are thrown into the rock behind them.

00:54:21.184 --> 00:54:29.228
SAM: Terrible! 12 points.

00:54:29.228 --> 00:54:35.660
TALIESIN: That was subpar.

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:40.242
MATT: That's okay. Both of them get hit and thrown
back, slam into the wall, and you watch as their

00:54:40.242 --> 00:54:45.156
body is unable to earthglide based on the force of
the impact, so it actually causes part of their

00:54:45.156 --> 00:54:49.945
body to crack intrinsically. And they both fall
back to the ground, and their feet sink into the

00:54:49.945 --> 00:54:56.847
stone about an inch or two. And they reposition
their stance. All right. Anything else you want to do?

00:54:56.847 --> 00:55:02.996
SAM: Oh shit, if I move away, he's going to take a
swing at me, isn't he? But that would be wise.

00:55:02.996 --> 00:55:04.548
MATT: Your call.

00:55:04.548 --> 00:55:08.497
SAM: No, I'll shelter in place.

00:55:08.497 --> 00:55:12.523
MATT: Okay. Now it's their turn.

00:55:12.523 --> 00:55:17.194
TRAVIS: They're going to come out asking for help,
because they've been--

00:55:17.194 --> 00:55:20.387
MARISHA: We've been stuck in his digestive tract!

00:55:20.387 --> 00:55:24.822
TRAVIS: And we're slaughtering them! We weren't
going to even say anything or do anything to you guys!

00:55:24.822 --> 00:55:33.013
MATT: First off, I need Keyleth, Vex, and Percival
to make a dexterity saving throw, please.

00:55:33.013 --> 00:55:35.780
LAURA: Natural 20!

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:37.136
MATT: Nice.

00:55:37.136 --> 00:55:41.832
MARISHA: That was so close to being a natural 20!

00:55:41.832 --> 00:55:44.030
TALIESIN: Not natural 20, but a 20 nonetheless.

00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:49.411
MATT: Okay. What did you get?

00:55:49.411 --> 00:55:51.769
MARISHA: 12.

00:55:51.769 --> 00:55:56.506
MATT: All right.

00:55:56.506 --> 00:55:59.541
LIAM: What, you're sucked in the ground? No!

00:55:59.541 --> 00:56:02.675
LAURA: The ground raised up?

00:56:02.675 --> 00:56:06.169
MARISHA: Did they turn us to stone? What did they
do?

00:56:06.169 --> 00:56:12.619
MATT: No. Keyleth, you all of a sudden watch as
the one behind you that is barely holding on

00:56:12.619 --> 00:56:20.208
angrily goes (impact) slams its fist into the
ground. And from the sudden vibration, the earth

00:56:20.208 --> 00:56:26.456
seems to rise up underneath and attempt to
swallow you. Vex and Percival, you both grab each

00:56:26.456 --> 00:56:30.618
other's hands and leap into the air, and it passes
under your feet. However, Keyleth is not fast

00:56:30.618 --> 00:56:36.645
enough and gets swallowed as it closes up (crash)
around her, and now there's a giant pile of earth

00:56:36.645 --> 00:56:41.619
and rock where Keyleth is buried within and
restrained. You both manage to move out of the way.

00:56:41.619 --> 00:56:43.995
LIAM: Yeah. Vax sees that and is not worried.

00:56:43.995 --> 00:56:46.437
(laughter)

00:56:46.437 --> 00:56:48.954
LAURA: She's fine.

00:56:48.954 --> 00:56:55.737
MATT: These guys are going to move up there. And
this guy's going to move up here. This guy's going

00:56:55.737 --> 00:57:02.878
to attempt to pummel the shit out of Scanlan. He's
going to make two slam attacks against you. That

00:57:02.878 --> 00:57:05.323
is a 20 and a 21.

00:57:05.323 --> 00:57:07.043
SAM: Yeah.

00:57:07.043 --> 00:57:20.360
MATT: You take 16 points of bludgeoning damage and
17 points of bludgeoning damage. And you watch as

00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:28.769
it slips into the wall and vanishes. You can make
an attack of opportunity against it. However, I am

00:57:28.769 --> 00:57:34.814
giving it three-quarters cover, as it pulls just
out of melee range and is mostly in the wall, so

00:57:34.814 --> 00:57:36.441
it gets plus five to armor class.

00:57:36.441 --> 00:57:44.435
SAM: I will swing my sword at it with advantage,
because I just inspired someone, and Mythcarver

00:57:44.435 --> 00:57:48.553
has that feature. The first one was better. 17
plus ten!

00:57:48.553 --> 00:57:51.884
MATT: That actually hits! Go ahead and roll
damage.

00:57:51.884 --> 00:57:55.144
TRAVIS: Mythcarver gets you some action once every
two years.

00:57:55.144 --> 00:58:07.699
SAM: I actually don't know. It says it's a
plus-three longsword. Does that mean it's 1d8 plus three?

00:58:07.699 --> 00:58:11.546
MATT: 1d8 plus three plus your strength modifier.

00:58:11.546 --> 00:58:23.454
SAM: So it's 1d8 plus four. And then I rolled a
one, so that's five. But it also says, somewhere

00:58:23.454 --> 00:58:31.439
in here, deals an additional 1d6 force damage! Oh
yeah! One.

00:58:31.439 --> 00:58:40.660
MATT: Hey, six free points of damage! It
vanishes somewhere inside the wall. You're not

00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:49.656
entirely sure where. Two attacks on you, Percival.
That is a 28 and a 19.

00:58:49.656 --> 00:58:50.948
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:58:50.948 --> 00:58:55.733
LIAM: Dang, Perce.

00:58:55.733 --> 00:58:57.137
MATT: 16 points of bludgeoning damage.

00:58:57.137 --> 00:58:58.489
TALIESIN: 16?

00:58:58.489 --> 00:59:01.243
MATT: Yep. And 15 points of bludgeoning damage.

00:59:01.243 --> 00:59:05.886
SAM: Shit! On a retreating enemy, I get to cast a
spell.

00:59:05.886 --> 00:59:14.688
MATT: War caster. Well, next time. That's against
you and against Vex. That is a 22?

00:59:14.688 --> 00:59:19.546
LAURA: Oh wait, that's Pike. Hold on. Yes, it hits
me.

00:59:19.546 --> 00:59:20.862
MATT: And 21.

00:59:20.862 --> 00:59:22.358
LAURA: My armor class is 21.

00:59:22.358 --> 00:59:30.294
MATT: So it still hits you, all right. You take 14
points of bludgeoning damage, and another 14

00:59:30.294 --> 00:59:34.285
points of bludgeoning damage. And then both of
these guys--

00:59:34.285 --> 00:59:36.865
TALIESIN: Do we get an attack of opportunity?

00:59:36.865 --> 00:59:40.549
MATT: You do. With a plus five to AC as this guy
sinks into the ground.

00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:43.424
LAURA: Can we shoot him with an arrow as he
sinks into the ground?

00:59:43.424 --> 00:59:44.871
MATT: No, it's a melee attack.

00:59:44.871 --> 00:59:46.442
TALIESIN: So I'm going to take a swing.

00:59:46.442 --> 00:59:48.233
MATT: All right.

00:59:48.233 --> 00:59:54.746
TALIESIN: That hits. Actually, I crit only with my
guns on a 19, right? I don't crit with my sword?

00:59:54.746 --> 01:00:05.524
MATT: I'm pretty sure you crit on a 19 or 20
regardless, but the hemorrhaging shot element

01:00:05.524 --> 01:00:06.791
doesn't happen.

01:00:06.791 --> 01:00:09.118
TALIESIN: The hemorrhaging shot obviously doesn't
happen even though it's a natural-- That's fine.

01:00:09.118 --> 01:00:21.431
I crit, so that's a ridiculous thing to
hit. 32 to hit.

01:00:21.431 --> 01:00:22.788
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

01:00:22.788 --> 01:00:25.447
TALIESIN: So that's a 1d8.

01:00:25.447 --> 01:00:27.324
TRAVIS: You never know, that guy could be
made out of concrete.

01:00:27.324 --> 01:00:35.691
TALIESIN: Two plus seven, and it's silvered, if
that matters. That's 16 points of piercing damage.

01:00:35.691 --> 01:00:42.875
MATT: All right, cool. So you strike out as it
disappears into the wall and vanishes. This guy

01:00:42.875 --> 01:00:44.943
here shifts into the wall as well.

01:00:44.943 --> 01:00:46.183
LIAM: He vanished?

01:00:46.183 --> 01:00:47.798
MATT: Well, he (sucking sound) into the wall.

01:00:47.798 --> 01:00:48.877
LAURA: They're all vanishing!

01:00:48.877 --> 01:00:50.083
TRAVIS: Well, not this guy, they're still
walking.

01:00:50.083 --> 01:00:52.585
MATT: And the guy who's right there is going to
take two strikes at you, Grog.

01:00:52.585 --> 01:00:57.731
TRAVIS: Oh, bring it. They both hit. They're
reckless.

01:00:57.731 --> 01:01:08.263
MATT: Yep. Yep. And the other attack-- Yep, both
hit. So that's 16 points of bludgeoning damage,

01:01:08.263 --> 01:01:14.014
reduced to eight. And 12 points of bludgeoning
damage, reduced to six.

01:01:14.014 --> 01:01:16.371
TRAVIS: Six. Can I take my retaliation strike
against him?

01:01:16.371 --> 01:01:17.648
MATT: You can.

01:01:17.648 --> 01:01:22.163
TRAVIS: Lovely. Reckless, Great Weapon Master.
Come on. Natural 20!

01:01:22.163 --> 01:01:25.461
MATT: Oh, that's going to suck!

01:01:25.461 --> 01:01:31.449
LAURA: Squish him! Make a building out of him! I
don't know.

01:01:31.449 --> 01:01:36.028
TRAVIS: Oh! I reroll ones and twos! Great. 11,
that's better.

01:01:36.028 --> 01:01:41.399
TALIESIN: You get all sorts of bonuses to that
crit.

01:01:41.399 --> 01:01:45.936
TRAVIS: 36, 42--

01:01:45.936 --> 01:01:48.365
LAURA: Now I've got David Bowie in my head.

01:01:48.365 --> 01:01:50.105
TRAVIS: 48.

01:01:50.105 --> 01:01:52.451
MATT: 48 points of damage.

01:01:52.451 --> 01:01:57.794
TRAVIS: Oh, necrotic. 52.

01:01:57.794 --> 01:02:00.895
TALIESIN: Is that doubled? And you doubled
everything into your extra crit--

01:02:00.895 --> 01:02:02.864
TRAVIS: I've been practicing.

01:02:02.864 --> 01:02:09.399
MATT: As it slams with both fists into you, with
one giant (whoosh) over the head as it impacts

01:02:09.399 --> 01:02:14.734
you, you grab with one hand the back of its fist
and grin, and then bring the axe straight up into

01:02:14.734 --> 01:02:20.086
its torso with one hand. It strikes and splits
open part of its rock chest and you hear this

01:02:20.086 --> 01:02:27.548
(guttural wheeze) which it reforms again. But
still, it's taken the brunt of the impact, and

01:02:27.548 --> 01:02:33.068
it's now going to shift into the wall, which you
can't attack because you already used your

01:02:33.068 --> 01:02:38.107
reaction. That ends their turn. Keyleth, you're
up. You're currently buried. You're blinded.

01:02:38.107 --> 01:02:46.517
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to concentrate for a
second, and then go earth elemental.

01:02:46.517 --> 01:02:52.630
(thud) And now that I'm earth elemental, I have
tremor sense. Can I sense where these other

01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:54.041
motherfuckers are?

01:02:54.041 --> 01:02:56.926
MATT: You can feel where they are, yeah. You can
sense them moving through the ground.

01:02:56.926 --> 01:03:01.425
SAM: Oh shit. Everybody dies.

01:03:01.425 --> 01:03:05.204
MARISHA: But I want to be underground. I'm there,
but I'm still underground right now.

01:03:05.204 --> 01:03:06.630
MATT: Right. I'm marking your place.

01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:07.516
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:03:07.516 --> 01:03:09.527
TALIESIN: (singing) Underground!

01:03:09.527 --> 01:03:14.689
MARISHA: (singing) Put on your earthglide shoes
and dance! (speaking) Okay, I want to go right

01:03:14.689 --> 01:03:23.124
in the center of as many of them as I can hit and
take a cue from Scanlan and do a Thunderwave

01:03:23.124 --> 01:03:24.837
underground.

01:03:24.837 --> 01:03:27.422
MATT: As your earth elemental? Because you have--

01:03:27.422 --> 01:03:30.553
MARISHA: Because I can cast in Wild Shape now.

01:03:30.553 --> 01:03:34.914
SAM: He's going to the phone. He's checking his
texts.

01:03:34.914 --> 01:03:39.061
TRAVIS: So if they're healing when we hit them, do
we think they're healing when they go back into

01:03:39.061 --> 01:03:40.216
the wall?

01:03:40.216 --> 01:03:41.748
TALIESIN: Probably.

01:03:41.748 --> 01:03:50.291
MATT: Let me see here real fast. What are the
components of Thunderwave?

01:03:50.291 --> 01:03:52.831
SAM: I will look for you!

01:03:52.831 --> 01:03:56.476
MATT: Thunderwave is verbal and somatic. Right?

01:03:56.476 --> 01:03:58.365
SAM: V, S!

01:03:58.365 --> 01:03:59.878
MATT: Correct.

01:03:59.878 --> 01:04:02.369
TRAVIS: Dude, that is a badass.

01:04:02.369 --> 01:04:06.600
MATT: Just making sure, because there is a slight
limitation to druid spellcasting in beast form.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.201
You're probably still good. Let me see.

01:04:08.201 --> 01:04:11.748
MARISHA: Not using material components, you mean?

01:04:11.748 --> 01:04:13.483
LAURA: He got bigger?

01:04:13.483 --> 01:04:16.765
MARISHA: No, that's me. That's me, baby, that's
me.

01:04:16.765 --> 01:04:18.376
LIAM: Should've seen the green.

01:04:18.376 --> 01:04:21.078
MATT: Yeah, verbal and somatic, so you can do
that.

01:04:21.078 --> 01:04:22.574
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:04:22.574 --> 01:04:24.344
MARISHA: I'm going to do it 3rd-level, too.

01:04:24.344 --> 01:04:29.057
MATT: 15-foot cube, the most guys you can hit
would probably be these two here, clustered

01:04:29.057 --> 01:04:31.970
together. Otherwise, everyone else is just a one
hit. They're too far spread out.

01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:34.286
MARISHA: It's a 15-foot radius from you.

01:04:34.286 --> 01:04:39.286
MATT: It's a 15-foot cube originating from you.
Meaning it's not a radial thing.

01:04:39.286 --> 01:04:44.827
MARISHA: Oh, like a (explosion noise). Oh, cool!
Got it. Then I'll take those two dudes.

01:04:44.827 --> 01:04:48.626
LIAM: So that's why Vax's feathers were prickling
the other time.

01:04:48.626 --> 01:04:52.462
MATT: So you shift through over here, beneath the
ground.

01:04:52.462 --> 01:04:54.464
LAURA: That's so cool.

01:04:54.464 --> 01:04:56.853
MARISHA: (thudding noises) Underground!

01:04:56.853 --> 01:04:59.088
LAURA: Look how much bigger she is than those
fucks!

01:04:59.088 --> 01:05:02.322
MARISHA: That's not a great roll, but it'll do.

01:05:02.322 --> 01:05:04.487
SAM: Do you get to reroll ones?

01:05:04.487 --> 01:05:06.835
MARISHA: Ones and twos.

01:05:06.835 --> 01:05:13.830
MATT: That's a 13 and a 17. So neither of them
make their save.

01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:20.924
MARISHA: So that is 16 times two, so 32 damage to
both of them.

01:05:20.924 --> 01:05:23.563
MATT: 32 points of damage to both of them.

01:05:23.563 --> 01:05:25.200
SAM: Did they make saves?

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.437
MARISHA: No.

01:05:26.437 --> 01:05:28.146
SAM: So they get pushed as well.

01:05:28.146 --> 01:05:30.088
MARISHA: And they also get pushed ten feet. Yeah.

01:05:30.088 --> 01:05:33.948
MATT: Well, they'd get pushed if they weren't in
the middle of the rock. They glide on their own.

01:05:33.948 --> 01:05:35.335
They stay put.

01:05:35.335 --> 01:05:36.612
MARISHA: Sure.

01:05:36.612 --> 01:05:47.592
MATT: All right. So as you (whoosh) outward, you
send the shockwave, and you guys hear this loud,

01:05:47.592 --> 01:05:53.013
thunderous (explosive thrum) beneath the ground.
And you watch as rock and dirt is thrown from this

01:05:53.013 --> 01:05:58.071
wall. Poor Trinket is spattered with rock and dirt
and spins around (bear growling).

01:05:58.071 --> 01:06:00.262
LAURA: Aw, buddy! You're okay!

01:06:00.262 --> 01:06:05.063
MATT: That wall is not looking very sturdy right
now. The Thunderwave has structurally damaged this

01:06:05.063 --> 01:06:06.853
whole portion of the cavern right now.

01:06:06.853 --> 01:06:08.419
TRAVIS: Thanks, Keyleth.

01:06:08.419 --> 01:06:11.013
MARISHA: This whole thing was coming apart!

01:06:11.013 --> 01:06:14.879
MATT: That ends Keyleth's turn. Pike's up.

01:06:14.879 --> 01:06:20.343
LIAM: What about between Grog and Scanlan? That
way if one of them comes up by either of them,

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:21.468
she's there.

01:06:21.468 --> 01:06:23.301
MARISHA: Get Trinket away from that wall.

01:06:23.301 --> 01:06:29.804
LAURA: Well, I would, if it was Trinket's turn.
Pike's going to run down and stand between Scanlan

01:06:29.804 --> 01:06:30.940
and Grog.

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:32.279
MATT: All right.

01:06:32.279 --> 01:06:33.725
LAURA: "Oh, Grog!"

01:06:33.725 --> 01:06:36.247
LIAM: Punch the mace and light that shit up.

01:06:36.247 --> 01:06:37.373
LAURA: Yeah.

01:06:37.373 --> 01:06:39.314
LIAM: Blow hair out of her face.

01:06:39.314 --> 01:06:41.415
MATT: Yeah, so she makes this beacon of light.

01:06:41.415 --> 01:06:44.807
LAURA: And then she's going to hold her action
until a thing appears.

01:06:44.807 --> 01:06:46.325
MATT: What is she holding?

01:06:46.325 --> 01:06:47.474
LAURA: Attacking.

01:06:47.474 --> 01:06:51.882
MATT: A physical attack? So as soon as one
appears, she's going to go ahead and swing. Okay,

01:06:51.882 --> 01:06:54.710
good. So she's holding that. That ends Pike's
turn. Top of the round: Percival, you're up.

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:56.290
TALIESIN: I'm going to--

01:06:56.290 --> 01:06:58.221
SAM: (whispers) No bonus action?

01:06:58.221 --> 01:07:04.138
TALIESIN: What? Well, I'm going to use my bonus
action. Since there's nothing to attack at the

01:07:04.138 --> 01:07:10.220
moment, I'm going to move slightly to the other
end of that little precipice that I'm on, over

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:11.608
where Keyleth disappeared.

01:07:11.608 --> 01:07:12.676
MATT: Oh, over this side?

01:07:12.676 --> 01:07:16.404
TALIESIN: Yeah, get away from things. I'm going to
use my bonus action to do a heal.

01:07:16.404 --> 01:07:20.911
MATT: You guys traveled this way, and this is
where you saw the right and left split.

01:07:20.911 --> 01:07:22.296
LAURA: Oh, right.

01:07:22.296 --> 01:07:29.747
TALIESIN: That was embarrassing. So that's 11
points of damage. That's great. And then I'm going

01:07:29.747 --> 01:07:32.989
to hold my attack until something approaches.

01:07:32.989 --> 01:07:37.465
MATT: Okay. So you get your weapon ready. You're
holding it for any sort of movement out of a wall.

01:07:37.465 --> 01:07:38.569
Got it.

01:07:38.569 --> 01:07:39.950
TALIESIN: Yeah. Gun in one hand, sword in the
other.

01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:41.300
MATT: All right, got it. Grog, you're up.

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:43.278
SAM: Why don't we just leave? There's no one
here.

01:07:43.278 --> 01:07:45.489
TRAVIS: I know, that's what I'm doing. So there's
no enemies in sight?

01:07:45.489 --> 01:07:46.823
MATT: Currently, no.

01:07:46.823 --> 01:07:51.342
TRAVIS: Ah! Can I run as far as I can this way?

01:07:51.342 --> 01:07:52.509
MATT: Yep.

01:07:52.509 --> 01:07:55.141
TRAVIS: Is that like five, ten, 15, 20--

01:07:55.141 --> 01:08:03.871
MATT: 50 is what you can get, right there.

01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:05.134
TRAVIS: I'll take it.

01:08:05.134 --> 01:08:06.434
MATT: All right, so that's your movement.

01:08:06.434 --> 01:08:11.422
TRAVIS: Yep. I'm going to hold my attack until
something stupid shows me its face.

01:08:11.422 --> 01:08:17.057
MATT: Okay, good to know. That ends your turn.
Vex.

01:08:17.057 --> 01:08:24.776
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to call Trinket away from
the wall, so he's going to run down next to Grog.

01:08:24.776 --> 01:08:26.556
MATT: Okay.

01:08:26.556 --> 01:08:31.843
LAURA: And then I'm going to kick off and get on
my broom, so I'm off the ground.

01:08:31.843 --> 01:08:35.717
MATT: Okay, so you get up, and you're now lifted
up into the air a bit.

01:08:35.717 --> 01:08:38.061
MARISHA: You're still blind?

01:08:38.061 --> 01:08:41.271
TALIESIN: No, I can see. We've got two light
sources now.

01:08:41.271 --> 01:08:42.728
MARISHA: Okay.

01:08:42.728 --> 01:08:44.571
TRAVIS: (singing) I believe I can--

01:08:44.571 --> 01:08:46.593
MATT: You believe you can what?

01:08:46.593 --> 01:08:47.713
TRAVIS: Fly?

01:08:47.713 --> 01:08:50.011
LIAM: (singing) Fucking die.

01:08:50.011 --> 01:08:53.195
TRAVIS: (singing) I believe I can touch--
(speaking) What does he touch?

01:08:53.195 --> 01:08:54.458
SAM: The sky?

01:08:54.458 --> 01:08:58.560
TRAVIS: The sky. (singing) I think about it
every--

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.861
MATT: Don't hurt yourself.

01:09:00.861 --> 01:09:04.343
TRAVIS: I'm never singing in character.

01:09:04.343 --> 01:09:08.048
LAURA: Don't speak!

01:09:08.048 --> 01:09:10.690
TRAVIS: (singing) I know just what you're saying!

01:09:10.690 --> 01:09:12.645
LAURA: How high is the ceiling in here?

01:09:12.645 --> 01:09:15.160
LIAM: About 20 feet.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.384
MATT: You are right up against this ceiling. It's
about 12 to 15 feet.

01:09:17.384 --> 01:09:20.411
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to want to hover right in
the middle. I don't want to be high up. I want to

01:09:20.411 --> 01:09:22.527
be right between the ceiling and the floor.

01:09:22.527 --> 01:09:24.570
MATT: Okay. So you're about a head's height up.

01:09:24.570 --> 01:09:30.880
LAURA: Yeah. (Southern accent) And I'm going to
hold my action until I can see one of those things.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.355
MATT: Arrow's notched, ready to fire?

01:09:32.355 --> 01:09:33.331
LAURA: Uh-huh.

01:09:33.331 --> 01:09:34.917
MATT: Okay. That brings us to Vax.

01:09:34.917 --> 01:09:42.889
LIAM: Can I move ten feet closer to Scanlan,
and do the classic Van Damme movement and stand

01:09:42.889 --> 01:09:47.348
between stalactites in the ceiling and hide with
my bonus action.

01:09:47.348 --> 01:09:48.264
MATT: Right here?

01:09:48.264 --> 01:09:49.740
LIAM: Yeah, and hide in the ceiling.

01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:50.550
MARISHA: What?

01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:51.785
TRAVIS: You going to Time Cop that shit?

01:09:51.785 --> 01:09:52.825
MARISHA: That's awesome!

01:09:52.825 --> 01:09:54.287
SAM: Are you doing the splits, right now, are your
legs--?

01:09:54.287 --> 01:09:58.356
LIAM: Nah, I'm just using my feet for that. No, my
hands are occupied. With my feet, yeah.

01:09:58.356 --> 01:10:00.152
MATT: Make a stealth check.

01:10:00.152 --> 01:10:01.777
LIAM: Stealth check. Yeah, baby.

01:10:01.777 --> 01:10:03.286
TALIESIN: Make a splits check.

01:10:03.286 --> 01:10:06.548
LIAM: Ten. Do I still have sneaky sneak from you?

01:10:06.548 --> 01:10:09.186
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace is still-- Oh, no. No,
I Hunter's Marked.

01:10:09.186 --> 01:10:12.100
LIAM: That's fine. Pike, get out of the way!

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:14.474
TRAVIS: Don't you talk to her like that!

01:10:14.474 --> 01:10:18.722
LIAM: 27. And I'll hold my attack action.

01:10:18.722 --> 01:10:20.659
MATT: Okay. Scanlan.

01:10:20.659 --> 01:10:23.152
SAM: We're all holding our shit?

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:27.903
LAURA: The minute something shows, we're all going
to be like, boom! But nothing's going to show.

01:10:27.903 --> 01:10:33.424
SAM: Nothing's going to show? Which way were we
going when all this shit happened?

01:10:33.424 --> 01:10:36.322
MATT: You were traveling this way, and this was
the split in the path ahead.

01:10:36.322 --> 01:10:38.191
TALIESIN: So we're heading left?

01:10:38.191 --> 01:10:40.436
SAM: Should we be trying to get out of here?

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:41.512
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:10:41.512 --> 01:10:43.082
TALIESIN: Let's get out of here. We don't need
this.

01:10:43.082 --> 01:10:44.873
TRAVIS: By the way, we're supposed to go to the
left.

01:10:44.873 --> 01:10:46.719
LAURA: Thanks, Grog.

01:10:46.719 --> 01:10:48.157
LIAM: Oh, yeah. That's right.

01:10:48.157 --> 01:10:50.070
TALIESIN: I would've made a run if I had been
thinking about it.

01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:51.471
TRAVIS: What's right? The left?

01:10:51.471 --> 01:10:52.696
LIAM: Right.

01:10:52.696 --> 01:11:01.492
SAM: I will go 25 feet the same direction Grog
went in, because that's all I can run.

01:11:01.492 --> 01:11:04.138
MATT: 25. That will get you up here next to
Percival.

01:11:04.138 --> 01:11:05.834
LAURA: Oh no!

01:11:05.834 --> 01:11:07.941
LIAM: He's dead! Right before the end of the
story!

01:11:07.941 --> 01:11:09.933
TRAVIS: Five points of bludgeoning damage.

01:11:09.933 --> 01:11:11.133
TALIESIN: (whispering) Stop it!

01:11:11.133 --> 01:11:12.601
LIAM: Sorry, Perce.

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:16.905
SAM: I'm sorry, Matt, I'm sorry. I'm going to go
in the opposite direction. I don't want to be in

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:22.526
this fucking cluster. It's a mess up there. I'm
going the opposite direction.

01:11:22.526 --> 01:11:26.970
LAURA: Down there? Why does it matter that we're
clustered?

01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:30.641
SAM: I don't care! I'm getting away from you
fuckers. And I'm turning invisible.

01:11:30.641 --> 01:11:35.247
(laughter)

01:11:35.247 --> 01:11:38.369
LIAM: They come out: "Where did they go?"

01:11:38.369 --> 01:11:41.584
TALIESIN: The question is, did you turn invisible,
then run?

01:11:41.584 --> 01:11:43.253
LAURA: Yeah, they can still sense you!

01:11:43.253 --> 01:11:46.239
SAM: Oh shit! I don't know these things!

01:11:46.239 --> 01:11:48.885
LAURA: And then we won't know that you didn't get
sucked under!

01:11:48.885 --> 01:11:50.783
TRAVIS: And if you attack, your Invisibility
drops.

01:11:50.783 --> 01:11:56.034
LAURA: Oh, shut up, that's so cool!

01:11:56.034 --> 01:11:57.931
TRAVIS: You've got an invisible woman mini!

01:11:57.931 --> 01:12:01.252
LIAM: That is my daughter's miniature.

01:12:01.252 --> 01:12:02.900
TRAVIS: That is rad.

01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:05.272
SAM: And as a bonus action, I will Healing Word
myself.

01:12:05.272 --> 01:12:07.054
MATT: You'd have to do Healing Word first.

01:12:07.054 --> 01:12:09.813
SAM: Huh? Oh, first, because--

01:12:09.813 --> 01:12:11.717
MATT: Because if you cast a spell, you lose
Invisibility.

01:12:11.717 --> 01:12:12.938
SAM: So I would do it first.

01:12:12.938 --> 01:12:17.375
MATT: Yeah, you can do that. All right, that ends
Scanlan's turn. All right.

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:18.675
LIAM: Oh. Shit.

01:12:18.675 --> 01:12:21.321
SAM: Seven more forms show up.

01:12:21.321 --> 01:12:22.453
MATT: First off, let's see--

01:12:22.453 --> 01:12:23.805
TRAVIS: Deuces wild.

01:12:23.805 --> 01:12:25.010
LIAM: Light them up!

01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:27.205
MATT: This one is going to emerge from under the
ground--

01:12:27.205 --> 01:12:28.869
MARISHA: Do I get an attack of opportunity?

01:12:28.869 --> 01:12:33.795
MATT: Hold on. You do not. What is the range on
your fists?

01:12:33.795 --> 01:12:35.377
LIAM: 50 feet.

01:12:35.377 --> 01:12:37.232
LAURA: Ten feet.

01:12:37.232 --> 01:12:41.238
MATT: If it's a ten-foot range on the elemental,
then you would, but--

01:12:41.238 --> 01:12:43.362
MARISHA: It doesn't say! How do you know?

01:12:43.362 --> 01:12:46.873
MATT: Under the slam attack, it should say range:
five foot? Melee attack?

01:12:46.873 --> 01:12:47.951
MARISHA: No.

01:12:47.951 --> 01:12:49.517
MATT: What does it say?

01:12:49.517 --> 01:12:50.844
MARISHA: No, no, it doesn't. No.

01:12:50.844 --> 01:12:52.123
MATT: Okay, then.

01:12:52.123 --> 01:12:58.670
MARISHA: I just don't, okay. No! Range: ten feet!
It does say range: ten feet.

01:12:58.670 --> 01:13:00.252
MATT: That's what I was asking for.

01:13:00.252 --> 01:13:01.785
MARISHA: I didn't know!

01:13:01.785 --> 01:13:09.293
MATT: You can use your reaction to get an attack
of opportunity on it. As he glides away from you

01:13:09.293 --> 01:13:14.521
and underneath, you get one swing at him. He gets
a plus five to his AC. Actually no, he wouldn't,

01:13:14.521 --> 01:13:15.547
because you have earthglide.

01:13:15.547 --> 01:13:16.550
MARISHA: 21.

01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:21.123
MATT: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage with the
fist. So you slam him within the stonework.

01:13:21.123 --> 01:13:25.959
TALIESIN: I love that you're actually being a
badass where no one can see.

01:13:25.959 --> 01:13:28.765
MARISHA: 15.

01:13:28.765 --> 01:13:36.892
MATT: 15 points of damage, all right. As you slam
it, your fists gliding through the rock like it

01:13:36.892 --> 01:13:42.016
was air, and slamming into the side, pushing it
even further forward, it swoops underneath. And

01:13:42.016 --> 01:13:46.717
with a giant uppercut as it emerges from the
ground, the earth swings up to try and consume

01:13:46.717 --> 01:13:50.470
both Grog and Trinket. I need you both to make a
dexterity saving throw, Trinket and Grog.

01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:51.776
LAURA: Oh no!

01:13:51.776 --> 01:13:53.404
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Danger sense!

01:13:53.404 --> 01:14:00.304
LAURA: Oh no, he rolled a one! Oh no, this was a
fan gift.

01:14:00.304 --> 01:14:01.767
TRAVIS: 15.

01:14:01.767 --> 01:14:08.505
MATT: Both of you, your vision goes dark as the
earth rises up to consume the space around you.

01:14:08.505 --> 01:14:12.808
Both Grog and Trinket are currently restrained and
blinded within the earth.

01:14:12.808 --> 01:14:14.895
LAURA: Oh no! Is Trinket right next to Grog, at
least?

01:14:14.895 --> 01:14:17.571
MATT: Yeah, they're within a close area.

01:14:17.571 --> 01:14:19.457
SAM: Grog, you're inspired.

01:14:19.457 --> 01:14:22.578
TRAVIS: Oh! It's too late for that.

01:14:22.578 --> 01:14:27.068
MATT: I would say so, the action's already
happened. If you want to, you can. It's what it's

01:14:27.068 --> 01:14:28.129
there for.

01:14:28.129 --> 01:14:29.485
LIAM: We have a nice DM.

01:14:29.485 --> 01:14:30.484
TRAVIS: 18.

01:14:30.484 --> 01:14:32.755
MATT: 18. All right, you barely manage to avoid--

01:14:32.755 --> 01:14:35.172
LAURA: Oh, now Trinket's all alone!

01:14:35.172 --> 01:14:36.618
TRAVIS: You are most gracious.

01:14:36.618 --> 01:14:42.218
MATT: So as the rock comes up to consume you, it
covers over both of you. And there's a brief

01:14:42.218 --> 01:14:50.586
moment of silence before Grog bursts out and steps
up onto the stone, unaffected by the impact. And

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:58.651
that's its full speed, so it can't earthglide
again. This one here is going to scoot and appear

01:14:58.651 --> 01:15:01.375
right around the edge on that side.

01:15:01.375 --> 01:15:02.826
LIAM: That's in range for me?

01:15:02.826 --> 01:15:03.929
MATT: It is, yes.

01:15:03.929 --> 01:15:05.099
LAURA: And me?

01:15:05.099 --> 01:15:06.317
MATT: Roll a perception check.

01:15:06.317 --> 01:15:08.821
LAURA: Yeah, that's a thing.

01:15:08.821 --> 01:15:11.064
LIAM: 24.

01:15:11.064 --> 01:15:14.164
MATT: That hits. And you do manage to--

01:15:14.164 --> 01:15:15.675
LAURA: 26!

01:15:15.675 --> 01:15:18.552
MATT: You do see it, so you can, if you want.

01:15:18.552 --> 01:15:19.687
LAURA: Okay.

01:15:19.687 --> 01:15:22.280
MATT: Yeah, sorry, I got a notification on my iPad
that went like, "no music."

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:24.548
LIAM: Am I effectively sneak attacking the fool?

01:15:24.548 --> 01:15:26.812
MATT: No.

01:15:26.812 --> 01:15:27.981
LIAM: No. All right.

01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:33.970
MATT: The tremor sense-- As you put your feet
against the stalactites, it seems to know where

01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:35.004
you are.

01:15:35.004 --> 01:15:36.161
LIAM: Cool. Sharpshooter for both.

01:15:36.161 --> 01:15:37.990
LAURA: The first one definitely hits. The second
one is 18.

01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.856
MATT: That hits.

01:15:38.856 --> 01:15:40.180
LAURA: Awesome!

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:45.371
LIAM: 28 and 26 for me.

01:15:45.371 --> 01:15:54.024
LAURA: Are you fucking kidding me? He's not
Hunter's Marked.

01:15:54.024 --> 01:16:04.447
LIAM: 38 combined, for my two. My paladin
attacks.

01:16:04.447 --> 01:16:06.230
LAURA: 27, combined.

01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:07.285
MATT: Damage?

01:16:07.285 --> 01:16:08.312
LAURA: Yeah.

01:16:08.312 --> 01:16:12.991
MATT: Okay. As it emerges from behind, you watch
as it brings back both of its fists to attempt to

01:16:12.991 --> 01:16:16.265
slam into the ground where Scanlan is currently
standing.

01:16:16.265 --> 01:16:18.427
SAM: He can't see me. Don't worry.

01:16:18.427 --> 01:16:20.164
(laughter)

01:16:20.164 --> 01:16:24.288
MATT: Yeah. His heavy footfalls still touching and
moving the earth in the vicinity, its tremor sense

01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:29.718
still notifying it of your base location. As he
goes to swing both of his fists--

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:32.402
SAM: I'm mocking him.

01:16:32.402 --> 01:16:40.962
MATT: A flurry of daggers and arrows go flying
through the air (whoosh) slamming into it before

01:16:40.962 --> 01:16:45.979
its fist can come down. Its chest is detonated
from the impact, the rock and shale scattering

01:16:45.979 --> 01:16:49.053
against the sides of the wall, its form destroyed
and scattered.

01:16:49.053 --> 01:16:50.386
MARISHA: Kill it!

01:16:50.386 --> 01:16:52.250
LIAM: That's a pretty fucking killer twin moment,
right there.

01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:58.065
TRAVIS: I've got to ask, when the creepy rock guy
popped up near me, is he within my held action?

01:16:58.065 --> 01:17:02.914
MATT: Unfortunately, no. He's about ten feet from
you. You've hit in the space, but the bear was

01:17:02.914 --> 01:17:04.079
closer to him.

01:17:04.079 --> 01:17:05.578
TRAVIS: Fair enough. I just stare at him.

01:17:05.578 --> 01:17:06.992
MATT: Yes, you do.

01:17:06.992 --> 01:17:15.232
This fellow here emerges right behind
Percival, right there. And is going to attempt to

01:17:15.232 --> 01:17:17.145
make two swing attacks at you.

01:17:17.145 --> 01:17:19.176
TALIESIN: I make two attacks on him before
anything happens, anyway.

01:17:19.176 --> 01:17:21.503
MATT: Mm-hmm. Go for it.

01:17:21.503 --> 01:17:24.055
TRAVIS: He's a little drunk. He's got that Soulja
lean going on.

01:17:24.055 --> 01:17:27.375
MATT: Is this with your gun?

01:17:27.375 --> 01:17:28.952
TALIESIN: No, this is sword.

01:17:28.952 --> 01:17:29.904
MATT: Yeah.

01:17:29.904 --> 01:17:38.135
TALIESIN: Too close. I knew they would jump, so.
That's 22 and 24.

01:17:38.135 --> 01:17:41.325
LAURA: I need more coffee.

01:17:41.325 --> 01:17:43.842
LIAM: You're at your most dashing when you use
your sword.

01:17:43.842 --> 01:17:57.932
TALIESIN: Yes, you know. That's 26 points of
damage. Oh, wait! I get three attacks, don't I,

01:17:57.932 --> 01:17:59.087
that's right?

01:17:59.087 --> 01:18:00.989
MATT: Yeah! Because you're on fire, dude!

01:18:00.989 --> 01:18:05.560
TALIESIN: That's right. 26 points of damage plus--
Oh yeah, that definitely hits. Plus eight more

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.291
points of damage.

01:18:07.291 --> 01:18:13.650
MATT: All right. So as it emerges from the wall,
coming toward you. You do this triple strike

01:18:13.650 --> 01:18:17.895
against it. And it manages to carve across part of
its chest, but its momentum is still strong, and

01:18:17.895 --> 01:18:23.227
both fists come to the side to hit you and rattle
you from both sides. That is a 16?

01:18:23.227 --> 01:18:24.189
TALIESIN: Nope!

01:18:24.189 --> 01:18:25.763
MATT: Misses! And a 24.

01:18:25.763 --> 01:18:26.831
TALIESIN: And that hits.

01:18:26.831 --> 01:18:34.316
MATT: So you manage to deflect one blow, the other
one clocks you on the side of the head. That is 11

01:18:34.316 --> 01:18:35.925
points of bludgeoning damage.

01:18:35.925 --> 01:18:41.889
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay. There's all the healing I
just did. It's all gone.

01:18:41.889 --> 01:18:47.861
MATT: All right. And now this fellow here is going
to swoop over and slam the ground near Pike.

01:18:47.861 --> 01:18:49.487
LAURA: Oh, good! She can attack him!

01:18:49.487 --> 01:18:54.499
MATT: The range on this is a ten by ten-foot cube,
so he's going to do it before he gets in melee

01:18:54.499 --> 01:18:59.907
range of her, she's right there. So as it glides
toward her, it slams the ground, and the earth is

01:18:59.907 --> 01:19:02.626
going to attempt to consume her. She needs to make
a dexterity saving throw.

01:19:02.626 --> 01:19:03.768
LAURA: I want to do it.

01:19:03.768 --> 01:19:04.897
LIAM: Okay, you do it.

01:19:04.897 --> 01:19:06.369
LAURA: I should not have claimed this.

01:19:06.369 --> 01:19:07.734
TRAVIS: With that dice?

01:19:07.734 --> 01:19:11.559
LAURA: Oh. We don't add anything to it.

01:19:11.559 --> 01:19:13.339
LIAM: It is a big seven.

01:19:13.339 --> 01:19:24.178
MATT: And with that, the ground consumes Pike, who
is now buried, blinded, and restrained within.

01:19:24.178 --> 01:19:26.838
LAURA: She was saving her action, though!

01:19:26.838 --> 01:19:31.512
MATT: And with the rest of its movement, it's
going to sink into the ground. We'll say--

01:19:31.512 --> 01:19:41.865
(counting) Yeah, it'll sink into the ground. Just
out of range. I'll put it here, just to mention

01:19:41.865 --> 01:19:44.517
where it is, but consider it's not prone, it's
underground.

01:19:44.517 --> 01:19:47.933
LIAM: It means he gave it rum tongue.

01:19:47.933 --> 01:19:50.290
MATT: You're going to die tonight.

01:19:50.290 --> 01:19:53.711
(laughter)

01:19:53.711 --> 01:19:56.132
TRAVIS: With such dedication!

01:19:56.132 --> 01:19:58.656
MATT: This one here is going to swing back
around--

01:19:58.656 --> 01:20:00.250
TALIESIN: Attack of opportunity!

01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:06.902
MATT: She already took one. One reaction. This one
bursts out of the ground to leap towards you. As it

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:11.270
emerges, it looks up and sees you just within its
range, it does have a bit of a reach. And it leaps

01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:16.888
to go ahead and make two swings at you. Natural
one. You manage to pull back with the broom and it

01:20:16.888 --> 01:20:21.734
swings wide and lands on the ground, and it's
going to attempt to go with another uppercut in

01:20:21.734 --> 01:20:23.376
your direction. That is a 15.

01:20:23.376 --> 01:20:26.434
LAURA: It doesn't hit. I put my foot on its fist
and--

01:20:26.434 --> 01:20:34.504
MATT: (laughs) Ding! No effect on that. And that's
going to end its turn, that's his full move. All right,

01:20:34.504 --> 01:20:36.032
so that brings us to Keyleth.

01:20:36.032 --> 01:20:39.494
MARISHA: Okay. Do I see Trinket underground?

01:20:39.494 --> 01:20:41.915
MATT: You can sense Trinket is currently buried.

01:20:41.915 --> 01:20:43.490
LAURA: Oh my god, thank you so much!

01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:45.478
MARISHA: Jesus, that scared the shit out of me.

01:20:45.478 --> 01:20:47.122
SAM: You said "I want coffee," and you got
coffee?

01:20:47.122 --> 01:20:50.342
LAURA: I know! But I didn't think anybody was
going to do it, really!

01:20:50.342 --> 01:20:51.570
MATT: I want a pony!

01:20:51.570 --> 01:20:53.108
SAM: I want ice cream!

01:20:53.108 --> 01:20:54.574
TALIESIN: Fly into the air!

01:20:54.574 --> 01:20:56.299
TRAVIS: I want that PowerBall winnings.

01:20:56.299 --> 01:21:03.579
MATT: If anyone could do it, Ryan Green could. All
righty. So, Keyleth, you can sense Trinket is

01:21:03.579 --> 01:21:05.679
buried over there, and Pike.

01:21:05.679 --> 01:21:10.635
MARISHA: Do I go for the bear, or do I go for the
gnome?

01:21:10.635 --> 01:21:12.476
LAURA: Go for the gnome!

01:21:12.476 --> 01:21:14.963
MARISHA: All right, can I get to Pike in 50 feet?

01:21:14.963 --> 01:21:16.247
MATT: What's your movement?

01:21:16.247 --> 01:21:17.144
MARISHA: 50.

01:21:17.144 --> 01:21:20.283
MATT: 50 feet glide? You can.

01:21:20.283 --> 01:21:35.650
MARISHA: Okay. Can I very gently grab the gnome,
and then siege monster bust us out?

01:21:35.650 --> 01:21:38.533
MATT: Okay, make a strength check. I'll give you
advantage because you are a siege monster.

01:21:38.533 --> 01:21:40.614
TRAVIS: Because you're a siege monster!

01:21:40.614 --> 01:21:43.815
MARISHA: I'm a siege monster!

01:21:43.815 --> 01:21:46.419
LIAM: Is it like reaching into a sack for you,
even though it's the earth?

01:21:46.419 --> 01:21:54.116
MARISHA: It's like air, he said. I will take that
17, that is much better. For a 22.

01:21:54.116 --> 01:21:59.287
MATT: With no issue, you punch through the massive
rock and earth right there, and you emerge out of

01:21:59.287 --> 01:22:04.384
it like a shoryuken, clutching Pike in your left
arm as you land back on your elemental feet in

01:22:04.384 --> 01:22:06.988
that space, bringing both of you--

01:22:06.988 --> 01:22:10.672
MARISHA: (excited earth elemental grunting)

01:22:10.672 --> 01:22:14.824
TRAVIS: (answering grunts) It sounds like a
concrete mixer.

01:22:14.824 --> 01:22:21.715
MATT: All righty. I believe that ends your turn?

01:22:21.715 --> 01:22:23.642
MARISHA: I can't do anything else, probably.

01:22:23.642 --> 01:22:25.455
MATT: Pike can, because it's her turn.

01:22:25.455 --> 01:22:31.252
MARISHA: But Pike can! So holding little Pike like
a voodoo doll, like a flashlight.

01:22:31.252 --> 01:22:33.080
MATT: Do things!

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:34.884
LAURA: That means she can still attack?

01:22:34.884 --> 01:22:36.179
MATT: She can, yeah.

01:22:36.179 --> 01:22:37.600
LAURA: She can't see anything, though.

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:40.518
MATT: No, she can, now. Keyleth just pulled her
out of the rubble and is holding her in front.

01:22:40.518 --> 01:22:43.088
LAURA: No, I mean, there's nothing to attack in
front of her.

01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:44.521
LIAM: What's this thing on the ground?

01:22:44.521 --> 01:22:46.126
LAURA: He's underground, still.

01:22:46.126 --> 01:22:48.968
TALIESIN: So there's two above ground, but they're
behind her.

01:22:48.968 --> 01:22:51.811
MARISHA: But I'm holding Pike! Can she see?

01:22:51.811 --> 01:22:53.111
LIAM: Can you throw her?

01:22:53.111 --> 01:22:58.498
LAURA: We're holding a physical action, so she has
to be next to something in order to attack it.

01:22:58.498 --> 01:22:59.698
MARISHA: Oh.

01:22:59.698 --> 01:23:01.306
TRAVIS: That's why mine didn't happen, either.

01:23:01.306 --> 01:23:02.793
MATT: Yeah, she can do whatever she wants.

01:23:02.793 --> 01:23:04.711
LIAM: And it would be an action to chuck her,
though, right?

01:23:04.711 --> 01:23:06.398
MATT: Yeah, she already pulled her free with her
action, so--

01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:08.556
LAURA: Did you use all your movement?

01:23:08.556 --> 01:23:10.063
MATT: She did.

01:23:10.063 --> 01:23:11.427
MARISHA: To get there.

01:23:11.427 --> 01:23:13.245
MATT: Well, actually, you had ten more feet, if
you wanted to.

01:23:13.245 --> 01:23:16.405
LAURA: Can you get within ten feet of something?
Five feet of something.

01:23:16.405 --> 01:23:17.929
MATT: No, unfortunately, no.

01:23:17.929 --> 01:23:22.319
LIAM: I mean, we could drop her where the thing
disappeared. It's still a crapshoot, but it's

01:23:22.319 --> 01:23:26.224
better than nothing. "Drop me on the ground,
Keyleth!"

01:23:26.224 --> 01:23:28.661
LAURA: "I want to be able to hit it if it comes
up!"

01:23:28.661 --> 01:23:31.872
MARISHA: (agreeing elemental grunts) (heavy thud)

01:23:31.872 --> 01:23:35.877
MATT: Sets the gnome down on the ground. That ends
Keyleth's turn. Now it's Pike's go.

01:23:35.877 --> 01:23:39.401
LIAM: Okay, she is going to still just hold her
turn--

01:23:39.401 --> 01:23:44.323
LAURA: Oh man! Should she do a cantrip? She should
do a Resistance or something?

01:23:44.323 --> 01:23:48.883
LIAM: She could do it on herself, just in case.
Yeah, cast Resistance on herself in case--

01:23:48.883 --> 01:23:50.872
LAURA: But that's an action, it's not a bonus.

01:23:50.872 --> 01:23:56.189
LIAM: Instead, she's going to look at the ground
and go, "Monstah!" And hold her mace.

01:23:56.189 --> 01:23:58.740
MATT: So she's holding her action to attack,
perfect. Percival, you're up. Top of the round.

01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:03.793
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull out the gun and take
three shots at that thing that's swinging at Vex.

01:24:03.793 --> 01:24:05.428
MATT: Okay, go for it.

01:24:05.428 --> 01:24:16.153
TALIESIN: Yeah! Oof, that's close. That's a 19?

01:24:16.153 --> 01:24:17.832
MATT: 19 hits.

01:24:17.832 --> 01:24:24.184
TALIESIN: Then the rest of them hit, too. It's
like 21 and 20, so let's get some d10s out.

01:24:24.184 --> 01:24:27.011
MARISHA: Do you need some more?

01:24:27.011 --> 01:24:40.921
TALIESIN: No, I got enough. Some d10s and some
d6s. So here we go. (counting) That's 12 points of

01:24:40.921 --> 01:24:43.112
psychic damage.

01:24:43.112 --> 01:24:44.964
TRAVIS: (makes weird noise)

01:24:44.964 --> 01:24:47.975
TALIESIN: I don't know what that was.

01:24:47.975 --> 01:24:50.290
LIAM: There is weird energy at this table!

01:24:50.290 --> 01:24:58.045
MATT: Okay, the first shot? As you reach over and
fire at that one, you hit it, and you watch as it

01:24:58.045 --> 01:25:00.415
scatters into stones across the far--

01:25:00.415 --> 01:25:03.909
TALIESIN: I'll put the first shot at that, and
then shift the next two to the other one.

01:25:03.909 --> 01:25:05.322
MATT: Yep. They have the same AC.

01:25:05.322 --> 01:25:13.129
TALIESIN: Okay, so that's seven points of psychic
damage, and 36 points of normal damage!

01:25:13.129 --> 01:25:13.934
MATT: To that one?

01:25:13.934 --> 01:25:15.179
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:25:15.179 --> 01:25:23.806
MATT: Okay, as the second one does blast a large
chunk out of its torso and side, it still stands

01:25:23.806 --> 01:25:26.787
there with its angered arms open, ready to swing at
whatever comes at it.

01:25:26.787 --> 01:25:30.053
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm good!

01:25:30.053 --> 01:25:32.293
MATT: All right, that ends Percival's turn. Grog,
you're up.

01:25:32.293 --> 01:25:39.197
TRAVIS: (grunts) Can I run over to the thing--

01:25:39.197 --> 01:25:41.796
MATT: You're standing above Trinket now.

01:25:41.796 --> 01:25:46.113
TRAVIS: It's just a pound of earth, right? I don't
hear anything, or see any fur or claws?

01:25:46.113 --> 01:25:47.762
MATT: No, not in a rage, you don't.

01:25:47.762 --> 01:25:53.488
TRAVIS: Fuck that shit! I reckless, Great Weapon
Master attack old Boney Face! Oh, that's terrible.

01:25:53.488 --> 01:26:01.295
That's better! Thank god for reckless! Sorry, 30
minus five, 25!

01:26:01.295 --> 01:26:02.468
MATT: That hits.

01:26:02.468 --> 01:26:12.547
TRAVIS: Yes! 33, plus the necrotic damage.

01:26:12.547 --> 01:26:14.769
LAURA: I'm going to help. I'm right there.

01:26:14.769 --> 01:26:15.994
SAM: Is there a guy next to you?

01:26:15.994 --> 01:26:17.502
LAURA: That's what I'm going to be aiming at,
darling.

01:26:17.502 --> 01:26:25.743
TRAVIS: Second attack. 26.

01:26:25.743 --> 01:26:27.900
MATT: That hits.

01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:38.187
TRAVIS: 28. No, 38!

01:26:38.187 --> 01:26:42.881
MATT: 38. Okay! As you stand over Trinket, the
first hit cleaves into the center of its chest,

01:26:42.881 --> 01:26:47.494
and wedges itself there, and you see the rocks
forming over the axe, almost trying to pull it

01:26:47.494 --> 01:26:50.943
into its body to pull it from your grip. And as
you do, instead you reach down and put your foot

01:26:50.943 --> 01:26:56.276
onto its chest and yank it outward. And as you do,
as most of it began to form over the axe, it

01:26:56.276 --> 01:26:59.338
bisects it in two and it crumples into a pile of
dirt on the ground.

01:26:59.338 --> 01:27:01.283
(cheering)

01:27:01.283 --> 01:27:08.357
MATT: So you still have 45 feet of movement.

01:27:08.357 --> 01:27:16.012
TRAVIS: Should I run down this tunnel and see
what's down here?

01:27:16.012 --> 01:27:17.161
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:27:17.161 --> 01:27:18.360
TRAVIS: Yeah?

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.862
LIAM: No! No!

01:27:20.862 --> 01:27:23.206
LAURA: He's raging! He doesn't have logic!

01:27:23.206 --> 01:27:26.858
TRAVIS: Can I see him from wherever I am? This
enemy?

01:27:26.858 --> 01:27:30.218
MATT: Yeah, I'd say you can. He's emerged. You can
see the movement.

01:27:30.218 --> 01:27:31.908
TRAVIS: I'll run up and join Percy.

01:27:31.908 --> 01:27:38.471
MATT: Okay. So you charge up beside, leap onto
this platform of soft earth and rock, and it's

01:27:38.471 --> 01:27:40.017
right there next to you.

01:27:40.017 --> 01:27:40.864
TRAVIS: Nice.

01:27:40.864 --> 01:27:42.638
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Vex.

01:27:42.638 --> 01:27:50.031
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to move my Hunter's Mark
over to that dude (radar sounds) and then I'm

01:27:50.031 --> 01:27:53.516
going to attack him with sharpshooter!

01:27:53.516 --> 01:27:55.976
LIAM: (laughs) Didgeridoos?

01:27:55.976 --> 01:27:57.501
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yep.

01:27:57.501 --> 01:28:00.934
SAM: Your Hunter's Mark sounds like Didgeridoos.
Or rain sticks.

01:28:00.934 --> 01:28:03.366
LAURA: So I'm at 20?

01:28:03.366 --> 01:28:05.450
MATT: 20 hits, yeah.

01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:09.763
LAURA: Okay. This is so weird!

01:28:09.763 --> 01:28:14.238
TALIESIN: This is super serious, you guys.

01:28:14.238 --> 01:28:16.237
LAURA: Four lightning damage.

01:28:16.237 --> 01:28:20.682
SAM: Don't worry, you'll be sleeping a lot at
Burning Man.

01:28:20.682 --> 01:28:31.489
LAURA: 28 for the first arrow. Plus the four
lightning damage.

01:28:31.489 --> 01:28:32.738
MATT: Yeah.

01:28:32.738 --> 01:28:40.013
LAURA: And then the second attack is also
sharpshooter, and that one hits.

01:28:40.013 --> 01:28:42.104
MATT: Okay. Even with the minus five?

01:28:42.104 --> 01:28:43.886
LAURA: Yes. Definitely.

01:28:43.886 --> 01:28:49.829
LIAM: Sam, when everyone leaves, all their stress
will enter you and I.

01:28:49.829 --> 01:28:51.986
TALIESIN: I'm very excited about that.

01:28:51.986 --> 01:28:53.568
LAURA: Six lightning damage.

01:28:53.568 --> 01:28:58.210
MARISHA: Like a lich. A phylactery.

01:28:58.210 --> 01:29:05.360
LAURA: 19! Oh! And I didn't add plus 20 to both of
those! Plus 20 overall because of the

01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:06.394
sharpshooter.

01:29:06.394 --> 01:29:12.979
MATT: All right. So with that, as you see it
crawling towards Percival, trying to grow and leap

01:29:12.979 --> 01:29:17.993
at it, and Grog leaps up in its way, there's a
very little space where you can actually see its

01:29:17.993 --> 01:29:22.899
movement. And as you watch Grog pull back with the
axe to almost go for a secondary strike, that

01:29:22.899 --> 01:29:26.577
brief opening, you see you have both arrows
notched and releasing both at the same time and as

01:29:26.577 --> 01:29:31.864
it does it sinks into both of the sockets where
the dark void of its eyes were. And it goes

01:29:31.864 --> 01:29:36.185
(creaking, crashing) and then falls into scattered
pieces of rock.

01:29:36.185 --> 01:29:39.708
LAURA: You're welcome!

01:29:39.708 --> 01:29:41.106
TALIESIN: Oh, very nice.

01:29:41.106 --> 01:29:45.969
MATT: All right. Do you want to move, or stay
where you are?

01:29:45.969 --> 01:29:46.997
LAURA: I'm going to stay.

01:29:46.997 --> 01:29:48.351
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up.

01:29:48.351 --> 01:29:51.436
LAURA: Wait! What about Trinket? Can he try to
save against it?

01:29:51.436 --> 01:29:58.153
MATT: I'll say I'll give you an action for Trinket
instead of an attack to attempt to break free.

01:29:58.153 --> 01:30:01.174
Make a strength check. Strength saving throw.

01:30:01.174 --> 01:30:06.452
LAURA: I don't know what the difference for a
saving throw for Trinket would be.

01:30:06.452 --> 01:30:07.877
MATT: Strength modifier.

01:30:07.877 --> 01:30:08.972
LAURA: 15.

01:30:08.972 --> 01:30:11.067
MATT: 15? Unfortunately, cannot break free. It's
not strong enough.

01:30:11.067 --> 01:30:13.033
LAURA: Can I hear him? Does he make noise?

01:30:13.033 --> 01:30:17.285
MATT: You listen, and you hear the shifting of
rock. That's it.

01:30:17.285 --> 01:30:19.384
LAURA: I don't even know it's Trinket, do I?

01:30:19.384 --> 01:30:20.493
MATT: Yeah, you don't.

01:30:20.493 --> 01:30:22.478
LAURA: I aim my bow at it.

01:30:22.478 --> 01:30:26.011
MATT: Okay. Vax, what are you doing?

01:30:26.011 --> 01:30:30.673
LIAM: I'm going to fly over and land on Keyleth's
shoulder and hold my attack for as soon as the

01:30:30.673 --> 01:30:32.240
fucknut appears.

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:33.316
MATT: Okay.

01:30:33.316 --> 01:30:37.824
LIAM: Perch. Dagon.

01:30:37.824 --> 01:30:43.385
MATT: Like your own personal raven. All right,
ending Vax's turn. Scanlan, you're up.

01:30:43.385 --> 01:30:47.173
SAM: I will use my insane climbing speed of ten?

01:30:47.173 --> 01:30:50.014
(laughter)

01:30:50.014 --> 01:30:55.771
SAM: To climb up that tree-like stalagmite.

01:30:55.771 --> 01:31:01.309
MATT: This technically is a root, and you climb up
into it.

01:31:01.309 --> 01:31:10.873
SAM: I will hold my attack until I see something
come out of somewhere.

01:31:10.873 --> 01:31:12.400
MATT: Okay, so your weapon's at the ready?

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:14.376
SAM: My Wand of Magic Missiles.

01:31:14.376 --> 01:31:25.669
MATT: Okay. Great. All right, so that ends
Scanlan's turn. At this point, shifting beneath

01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:30.433
the ground and emerging right there behind Pike--

01:31:30.433 --> 01:31:32.027
LAURA: She's attacking it.

01:31:32.027 --> 01:31:37.375
TRAVIS: It gets to act first.

01:31:37.375 --> 01:31:44.691
LAURA: Does it? No, she gets to act first. Yeah!
So that's 24 to attack.

01:31:44.691 --> 01:31:46.722
MATT: 24 to attack? That hits.

01:31:46.722 --> 01:31:50.759
LIAM: And she'll use divine whatsit. Divine
Strike.

01:31:50.759 --> 01:31:52.511
LAURA: She always gets that now.

01:31:52.511 --> 01:31:53.850
LIAM: Once a round.

01:31:53.850 --> 01:32:01.570
LAURA: That's 2d6 plus four radiant damage, so
ten, 14.

01:32:01.570 --> 01:32:05.970
LIAM: Plus 2d8.

01:32:05.970 --> 01:32:08.268
TRAVIS: I thought that went in the coffee.

01:32:08.268 --> 01:32:10.083
LAURA: Should that count?

01:32:10.083 --> 01:32:11.746
SAM: You didn't intentionally roll it.

01:32:11.746 --> 01:32:13.569
LIAM: Do it again.

01:32:13.569 --> 01:32:17.763
LAURA: It's not as good as the unintentional, but
that's okay. 19.

01:32:17.763 --> 01:32:19.138
MATT: 19?

01:32:19.138 --> 01:32:21.478
LAURA: Yeah. Does she just attack the once?

01:32:21.478 --> 01:32:24.472
LIAM: Yeah, and if it's still standing, dagger,
dagger, dagger.

01:32:24.472 --> 01:32:41.154
MATT: Hold on. Let me check one thing real fast.
The war cleric... Actually, yeah, because it's a

01:32:41.154 --> 01:32:47.389
bonus action to do that. Against that one? How
does Pike want to do this?

01:32:47.389 --> 01:32:49.552
(cheering)

01:32:49.552 --> 01:32:51.169
TRAVIS: Pikey!

01:32:51.169 --> 01:32:53.535
LAURA: She goes, "Grog, watch this!"

01:32:53.535 --> 01:32:56.245
TRAVIS: I can't see anything because a person's in
the way.

01:32:56.245 --> 01:32:57.715
LAURA: You can see; you're big.

01:32:57.715 --> 01:33:02.014
LIAM: She does an underswing right up between its
legs and hits it in the goolies.

01:33:02.014 --> 01:33:10.709
MATT: As she does, the glowing mace scatters
upward, breaking layer after layer of rock and

01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:17.059
earth. Its upper torso explodes into the ceiling,
a shower of small pebbles and errant pieces of

01:33:17.059 --> 01:33:20.311
earth are smeared across the wall and scatter to
the ground.

01:33:20.311 --> 01:33:22.113
TRAVIS: Untamed monster!

01:33:22.113 --> 01:33:26.924
LIAM: She gives it three or four more hits on the
ground out of frustration.

01:33:26.924 --> 01:33:28.650
LAURA: Yeah, because she got trapped.

01:33:28.650 --> 01:33:29.977
LIAM: Yep.

01:33:29.977 --> 01:33:32.073
MARISHA: I go rescue the bear.

01:33:32.073 --> 01:33:35.373
LAURA: Be careful! I think there's another
elemental right there.

01:33:35.373 --> 01:33:37.165
MARISHA: Are there any more?

01:33:37.165 --> 01:33:39.126
LAURA: I think Trinket's an elemental.

01:33:39.126 --> 01:33:48.343
MATT: As you guys all make your way over to the
pile, as it's shifting and moving, you all prepare

01:33:48.343 --> 01:33:56.448
your weaponry for what might emerge. Make a
perception check, Vex.

01:33:56.448 --> 01:34:03.439
LAURA: Oh no, don't you make me attack my own
bear. Oh no. 17?

01:34:03.439 --> 01:34:10.210
MATT: That's plenty. The moment you see some of
the movement push through, a claw begins to emerge

01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:14.449
from it and your arrow pulls back, ready to
release, but the moment it's there, you

01:34:14.449 --> 01:34:16.687
immediately wonder how you could have made that
mistake.

01:34:16.687 --> 01:34:18.101
LAURA: Trinket! I run.

01:34:18.101 --> 01:34:20.437
MATT: All of you rush over and begin to help
Trinket free.

01:34:20.437 --> 01:34:26.302
LIAM: I place my hand on Scanlan's shoulder and
say: I'm sorry. I know this is hard for you. The

01:34:26.302 --> 01:34:27.851
bear lives.

01:34:27.851 --> 01:34:32.898
SAM: And I say from the top of the tree, I don't
know who you're touching, but I'm up on top of a tree.

01:34:32.898 --> 01:34:34.214
LIAM: I'm flying!

01:34:34.214 --> 01:34:35.565
SAM: I'm invisible.

01:34:35.565 --> 01:34:37.853
(laughter)

01:34:37.853 --> 01:34:44.203
LIAM: There's a lot of rules in this game. Staying
on theme for the night.

01:34:44.203 --> 01:34:51.959
SAM: Yes, I know. It lives, for now. I was holding
my action; I could blast the bear with my wand.

01:34:51.959 --> 01:34:55.122
She wouldn't even know where I was coming from.

01:34:55.122 --> 01:34:57.156
LAURA: I would see you the minute you attacked.

01:34:57.156 --> 01:34:58.456
SAM: (whispering) Oh, she's right.

01:34:58.456 --> 01:35:01.300
(laughter)

01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:13.172
MATT: So this battle has transpired in the length
of one stride of the Titan, as the other footfall

01:35:13.172 --> 01:35:18.857
lands, (thumping) one portion of the wall begins
to shake and fall in and this side of the tunnel

01:35:18.857 --> 01:35:20.207
begins to collapse.

01:35:20.207 --> 01:35:21.977
LAURA: Oh, we got to take off, we got to start
moving.

01:35:21.977 --> 01:35:26.201
MARISHA: Keyleth blocks as much as she can and
goes (earth elemental speaking).

01:35:26.201 --> 01:35:27.771
LAURA: Run. I think she's saying run.

01:35:27.771 --> 01:35:33.522
MATT: So as you guys dart down and head left into
the hallway, your earth elemental form allows you

01:35:33.522 --> 01:35:37.143
with quite a bit of strength to force it and
prevent it from causing the entire tunnel to

01:35:37.143 --> 01:35:42.262
collapse. Just half of it does, and holding that
in space you guys begin to charge down the left

01:35:42.262 --> 01:35:43.668
side of the tunnel.

01:35:43.668 --> 01:35:49.463
LAURA: As we're running I cast Pass Without A
Trace again. Should I?

01:35:49.463 --> 01:35:51.605
LIAM: Sure, sure.

01:35:51.605 --> 01:35:55.806
And I pat your big stony face and give it a
kiss and fly down the hall.

01:35:55.806 --> 01:35:58.166
LAURA: Okay, never mind, I don't cast it.

01:35:58.166 --> 01:36:05.741
MATT: Okay. As you guys continue down the left
path for about 50 or so feet, it curves rapidly to

01:36:05.741 --> 01:36:14.524
the left and stops at a cylindrical chamber. It's
still a cavernous space, but it has a cylindrical

01:36:14.524 --> 01:36:21.272
shape to it. About 40 feet in diameter, about 50
feet tall at its apex, and in the center of it,

01:36:21.347 --> 01:36:26.316
you see a partially collapsed dark stone pavilion
or small temple.

01:36:26.316 --> 01:36:28.566
LIAM: At the bottom in the middle?

01:36:28.566 --> 01:36:33.695
MATT: Well, you guys turn and it's in the center
of this chamber that rises up before you in the

01:36:33.695 --> 01:36:40.764
center of this small, egg-shaped opening, the
space. And you see this made of a deep, dark,

01:36:40.764 --> 01:36:47.355
grayish, almost black stone structure that looks
beautifully made. The craftwork is distinctly dwarven.

01:36:47.355 --> 01:36:48.767
LAURA: Is it old?

01:36:48.767 --> 01:36:51.164
MATT: You can go make an investigation check on it
if you'd like.

01:36:51.164 --> 01:36:52.758
LIAM: I'm going to do Divine Sense again.

01:36:52.758 --> 01:36:53.799
MATT: Okay.

01:36:53.799 --> 01:36:54.761
LIAM: For undead.

01:36:54.761 --> 01:36:56.209
TRAVIS: They're everywhere.

01:36:56.209 --> 01:36:57.724
MATT: You do sense--

01:36:57.724 --> 01:37:00.490
LIAM: Specifically a location.

01:37:00.490 --> 01:37:04.262
MATT: --specifically within the heart of this
structure.

01:37:04.262 --> 01:37:12.963
LAURA: Is this--? No, this is not mountain.

01:37:12.963 --> 01:37:14.679
TRAVIS: (laughs) No!

01:37:14.679 --> 01:37:16.364
LAURA: This is titan.

01:37:16.364 --> 01:37:19.001
TRAVIS: (Laura voice) Is this favored terrain?

01:37:19.001 --> 01:37:22.634
MATT: This would be considered subterranean. It
would be like an underground.

01:37:22.634 --> 01:37:25.916
LAURA: Okay, so not Underdark?

01:37:25.916 --> 01:37:31.063
MATT: Not Underdark, no. The structure, however,
is somewhat damaged from a collapse on one side of

01:37:31.063 --> 01:37:37.553
the wall. You watch as part of the chamber on the
right side has come loose and this rockslide has

01:37:37.553 --> 01:37:43.584
jammed into the side of the structure. And looking
past the craggy piles of loose rock, you can see

01:37:43.584 --> 01:37:49.383
shattered glass across the ground, and part of the
rock as the rockslide has pushed into one of these

01:37:49.383 --> 01:37:58.425
glass panels that marks the exterior of the small,
gazebo-like temple structure. It seems to have

01:37:58.425 --> 01:38:03.632
filled, from what you can see at least at this
distance, a portion of the interior as well. There

01:38:03.632 --> 01:38:09.125
is a double door in the front that is currently
closed and the right side of the door is buried

01:38:09.125 --> 01:38:13.941
partially by the remainder of this rockslide that
has come to a halt at the base of the structure.

01:38:13.941 --> 01:38:18.676
LAURA: Do we know what gods dwarves worshipped? Do
they have specific gods?

01:38:18.676 --> 01:38:20.066
MATT: Make a religion check.

01:38:20.066 --> 01:38:21.523
LIAM: These are dead dwarves.

01:38:21.523 --> 01:38:30.343
Pike starts whispering, "I can technically
destroy dead things, so, if we sneak me up to the

01:38:30.343 --> 01:38:31.717
"outside of the wall--"

01:38:31.717 --> 01:38:32.754
LAURA: Five.

01:38:32.754 --> 01:38:41.133
MATT: I mean, you ran into the Allfather's space
before, but not every dwarf worships the

01:38:41.133 --> 01:38:46.042
Allfather. Just like any other free race in the
world, religion's up for grabs.

01:38:46.042 --> 01:38:49.011
TALIESIN: Knowing the history of this city, would
we know what this is?

01:38:49.011 --> 01:38:56.804
MATT: You don't know what this is at first glance.
The structure seems ceremonial or at least

01:38:56.804 --> 01:38:58.059
important.

01:38:58.059 --> 01:39:02.246
It seems to have been placed here with intent away
from a large part of society.

01:39:02.246 --> 01:39:05.595
TALIESIN: It's not a crypt or anything like that?
Or a very expensive crypt.

01:39:05.595 --> 01:39:06.695
MATT: It could be.

01:39:06.695 --> 01:39:09.184
TRAVIS: Do we see the inside of the gazebo-type
structure?

01:39:09.184 --> 01:39:10.961
LIAM: How big is it, too?

01:39:10.961 --> 01:39:18.353
MATT: How big is it? It's about, maybe, I'd say,
35 feet wide? It almost fills the entirety of the

01:39:18.353 --> 01:39:21.647
chamber. There's like a slight space behind it,
except for the fact that part of the wall

01:39:21.647 --> 01:39:25.340
collapsed into it and is burying the right side of
the structure.

01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:26.902
TRAVIS: Colored glass?

01:39:26.902 --> 01:39:31.233
MATT: Looking at the glass, it's multiple colors.
Looks to be of stained glass type, and it's a

01:39:31.233 --> 01:39:36.276
thick glass. And there is one intact window of
stained glass on the opposite side and there is

01:39:36.276 --> 01:39:38.784
the double doors currently that keep it shut.

01:39:38.784 --> 01:39:41.636
TALIESIN: Is there an image on the stained glass.
Is it depicting something?

01:39:41.636 --> 01:39:52.089
MATT: It looks to depict a dwarvish-like figure,
adorned in golden armor, that stands at the

01:39:52.089 --> 01:39:58.562
precipice of a mountain, with a series of smaller
dwarf-like entities in shadow all around looking

01:39:58.562 --> 01:40:05.438
up at it. It's very simple when you get up close
to it, but the further back you go, it's a

01:40:05.438 --> 01:40:06.762
beautiful arrangement.

01:40:06.762 --> 01:40:08.528
TALIESIN: I bet it's a crypt, which means that
it's trapped, and I bet that means there's

01:40:08.528 --> 01:40:10.086
something expensive and interesting inside.

01:40:10.086 --> 01:40:11.226
LIAM: DM, question.

01:40:11.226 --> 01:40:12.187
MATT: Yes.

01:40:12.187 --> 01:40:16.402
LIAM: Because I can't remember for sure, didn't,
in our story somewhere, we come up with a solution

01:40:16.402 --> 01:40:19.995
for Pike's noisiness? Something that quieted her
down?

01:40:19.995 --> 01:40:21.681
LAURA: She had stealth boots.

01:40:21.681 --> 01:40:26.146
MATT: Yes, her boots, they gave her advantage on
stealth, which meant that she just made a regular roll.

01:40:26.146 --> 01:40:27.130
LIAM: Regular roll.

01:40:27.130 --> 01:40:28.210
MATT: Yes.

01:40:28.210 --> 01:40:31.176
MARISHA: We made her that armor that we never went
back and picked up because we fucked up.

01:40:31.176 --> 01:40:33.466
LAURA: Yeah, but it doesn't matter because she's
got the Dawnmartyr.

01:40:33.466 --> 01:40:37.378
LIAM: She casts Guidance on herself to help with
that roll.

01:40:37.378 --> 01:40:41.071
TRAVIS: I'm with you. I think this thing has a
yield.

01:40:41.071 --> 01:40:42.632
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm feeling it.

01:40:42.632 --> 01:40:44.034
SAM: Break all the glass, go inside.

01:40:44.034 --> 01:40:48.547
MARISHA: I touch the ground, still in my earth
elemental form, do I sense anything? Tremor sense?

01:40:48.547 --> 01:40:50.080
Any vibrations?

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:56.236
MATT: You feel for it. Nothing in the immediate vicinity.
However, another footfall hits from the titan and

01:40:56.236 --> 01:41:01.336
it causes the entirety of the chamber to quake and
it's almost like, you know when Superman opens up

01:41:01.336 --> 01:41:03.265
his perception too wide and hears all the voices?

01:41:03.265 --> 01:41:04.526
MARISHA: Yep, mm-hmm.

01:41:04.526 --> 01:41:09.926
MATT: Everything around you shakes with such an
intense ferocity, it causes your head to shake briefly.

01:41:09.926 --> 01:41:12.267
LIAM: I have another DM question.

01:41:12.267 --> 01:41:13.264
MATT: Yes.

01:41:13.264 --> 01:41:17.032
LIAM: For paladins, "Until the end of your next
turn, you know the location of &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; undead within

01:41:17.032 --> 01:41:19.522
"60 feet," so that implies number.

01:41:19.522 --> 01:41:20.844
MATT: Correct.

01:41:20.844 --> 01:41:23.520
LIAM: If I know the location of &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt;, so how many
am I sensing?

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:24.454
MATT: One.

01:41:24.454 --> 01:41:27.008
LIAM: One. Okay.

01:41:27.008 --> 01:41:28.709
LAURA: Do you know where? Can you sense where it
is?

01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:30.423
MATT: It's in the center of this structure.

01:41:30.423 --> 01:41:31.261
LIAM: Center.

01:41:31.261 --> 01:41:32.607
TALIESIN: All right. Let's do this.

01:41:32.607 --> 01:41:34.007
MARISHA: Oh. Okay.

01:41:34.007 --> 01:41:35.470
LAURA: You want to fight it?

01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:37.534
TALIESIN: I bet there's something really nice
inside.

01:41:37.534 --> 01:41:42.844
LIAM: Also, I mean, if Pike can get up and get a
peek in, she could take a first shot at turning

01:41:42.844 --> 01:41:45.004
it. Turnt. Stay turnt.

01:41:45.004 --> 01:41:50.609
MARISHA: So there are the double doors and then
it's a cave-in on one side?

01:41:50.609 --> 01:41:56.477
MATT: On one side, and it's broken one of two sets
of stained glass on the front of it, and it seems

01:41:56.477 --> 01:42:01.627
to have filled part of the interior. Currently,
there isn't enough space in that window to climb

01:42:01.627 --> 01:42:05.173
in. It's filled with rock. You could try and move
stuff out of the way, or go through the doors, or

01:42:05.173 --> 01:42:08.583
break the other windows. Those are the only types
of entrance you can find.

01:42:08.583 --> 01:42:10.988
LAURA: And there's no other exit from this
cylindrical chamber?

01:42:10.988 --> 01:42:12.387
MATT: That you see, no.

01:42:12.387 --> 01:42:13.292
LAURA: Okay.

01:42:13.292 --> 01:42:20.531
LIAM: I wonder if getting Pike on the broom or the
rug could improve her chances of sneaking up to

01:42:20.531 --> 01:42:24.685
the door as well, and get a peek in, and try to
turn whatever's inside?

01:42:24.685 --> 01:42:28.999
LAURA: Oh, I mean we could try it. I'll put Pike
on the broom.

01:42:28.999 --> 01:42:30.044
LIAM: Okay.

01:42:30.044 --> 01:42:34.273
LAURA: And we'll fly over to the side of the
cave-in?

01:42:34.273 --> 01:42:39.108
MARISHA: I can just earth glide under and peek
up.

01:42:39.108 --> 01:42:40.870
LAURA: Yeah, but she can turn undead.

01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:46.004
TRAVIS: But how many times can she do that in a
day? Is that a pull the trigger and once? Do we

01:42:46.004 --> 01:42:47.792
want to waste it on something--

01:42:47.792 --> 01:42:49.091
LAURA: As an action.

01:42:49.091 --> 01:42:50.217
LIAM: Unlimited.

01:42:50.217 --> 01:42:51.107
LAURA: As an action.

01:42:51.107 --> 01:42:52.203
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:42:52.203 --> 01:42:53.379
MATT: It's an action.

01:42:53.379 --> 01:42:54.409
MARISHA: Is it a spell?

01:42:54.409 --> 01:42:55.442
LIAM: No.

01:42:55.442 --> 01:42:56.935
TRAVIS: I mean it could be an undead--

01:42:56.935 --> 01:42:58.700
MATT: A Channel Divinity, is that what you're
talking about?

01:42:58.700 --> 01:42:59.638
LAURA: Yeah.

01:42:59.638 --> 01:43:00.874
TALIESIN: It just works.

01:43:00.874 --> 01:43:06.610
LAURA: Oh wait, you can use your Channel Divinity
&lt;i&gt;twice&lt;/i&gt; between rests.

01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:11.767
LIAM: Okay, so she can do that. She's got a couple
of other things she can do with this ability.

01:43:11.767 --> 01:43:13.169
LAURA: And is she 18th level?

01:43:13.169 --> 01:43:14.211
LIAM: She's 18th level.

01:43:14.211 --> 01:43:16.099
LAURA: Ooh, so now she can do it three times
between rests.

01:43:16.099 --> 01:43:19.301
LIAM: It's worth a shot, because we could one-shot
a thing, possibly.

01:43:19.301 --> 01:43:23.909
MATT: She's 17th right now-- oh no, I think she
just leveled up. I'll double check. No, because

01:43:23.909 --> 01:43:25.049
&lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; just hit 18th.

01:43:25.049 --> 01:43:26.168
SAM: I just hit 18th.

01:43:26.168 --> 01:43:27.416
MATT: Yep, so she's still 17th.

01:43:27.416 --> 01:43:29.014
LIAM: Possible one shot.

01:43:29.014 --> 01:43:30.991
TRAVIS: Might just be a dwarven king.

01:43:30.991 --> 01:43:32.299
TALIESIN: Let's see what happens.

01:43:32.299 --> 01:43:33.408
SAM: Let's do it.

01:43:33.408 --> 01:43:34.491
MATT: Let me double check.

01:43:34.491 --> 01:43:36.017
MARISHA: Probably is, he's just undead now.

01:43:36.017 --> 01:43:38.187
LAURA: So we should try to get her in and turn
him?

01:43:38.187 --> 01:43:39.099
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:43:39.099 --> 01:43:40.100
LAURA: Okay. Yeah, let's do that.

01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:46.250
TRAVIS: Or he's totally encased by the material
and if we unearth him--

01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:47.526
MARISHA: It could be bad.

01:43:47.526 --> 01:43:48.495
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:43:48.495 --> 01:43:51.531
MARISHA: Or he's unearthed and-- yeah he could be
blocking a--

01:43:51.531 --> 01:43:52.856
TRAVIS: Let sleeping dogs lie?

01:43:52.856 --> 01:43:53.862
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:43:53.862 --> 01:43:56.070
LAURA: Percy really wants to find treasure.

01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:58.380
TALIESIN: Well, which is always a bad sign, but
there it is.

01:43:58.380 --> 01:43:59.771
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's do this!

01:43:59.771 --> 01:44:03.223
SAM: In what realm of possibility are we not going
into this thing?

01:44:03.223 --> 01:44:07.668
LAURA: Well, we could just turn around and walk
away and find our way up to the city!

01:44:07.668 --> 01:44:09.104
SAM: Have we ever done that?

01:44:09.104 --> 01:44:10.365
TRAVIS: Go check that door before I do.

01:44:10.365 --> 01:44:11.484
LAURA: All right.

01:44:11.484 --> 01:44:13.242
LIAM: You guys go, everybody hang back.

01:44:13.242 --> 01:44:14.066
TALIESIN: Check for traps!

01:44:14.066 --> 01:44:15.529
LIAM: Yeah, do I spot anything? Here comes the
roll.

01:44:15.529 --> 01:44:17.691
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, I'm going to cast Pass
Without A Trace on us now.

01:44:17.691 --> 01:44:21.647
TALIESIN: I'm keeping my distance and pulling out
the rifle and I'm pointing, if anything needs

01:44:21.647 --> 01:44:23.189
shooting, I'm going to shoot it.

01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:24.477
MARISHA: I'm going to be with him by this door.

01:44:24.477 --> 01:44:25.495
MATT: So you--?

01:44:25.495 --> 01:44:27.655
LIAM: Checking for traps, investigation right?
20.

01:44:27.655 --> 01:44:34.016
MATT: All right, so 20. As you go towards the
door, you can look around and see the door before

01:44:34.016 --> 01:44:42.675
you. It's partially buried and it isn't locked,
but you can see there are some runic carvings

01:44:42.675 --> 01:44:48.512
along the perimeter of the doorway, similar to
what you saw earlier on the pieces of stone when

01:44:48.512 --> 01:44:52.949
you first entered, and there are signs of forced
entry. It looks like there are parts of the stone

01:44:52.949 --> 01:44:57.998
that have been chipped, familiar to you from
people that use crowbars or other materials to

01:44:57.998 --> 01:45:04.231
break into entry places. It looks like there have
been signs of forced entry in the past.

01:45:04.231 --> 01:45:08.986
LIAM: However, there's still an undead thing
inside.

01:45:08.986 --> 01:45:12.653
MARISHA: It could just be a fight? Deplete us
down.

01:45:12.653 --> 01:45:14.094
LIAM: But I don't find any traps?

01:45:14.094 --> 01:45:16.526
MATT: You do not find any traps in the door, no.

01:45:16.526 --> 01:45:18.674
LAURA: It could just be a fight to take away our
stuff, before we go to a bigger fight.

01:45:18.674 --> 01:45:19.763
MARISHA: Correct.

01:45:19.763 --> 01:45:24.299
MATT: All you find is the door on the left appears
to be unlocked and you could possibly push it

01:45:24.361 --> 01:45:28.326
open, and you see the dwarven writing on the
outside of the wall.

01:45:28.326 --> 01:45:30.854
LIAM: (sighs)

01:45:30.854 --> 01:45:33.487
MARISHA: Ah, come on. We're running out of time.

01:45:33.487 --> 01:45:35.160
TRAVIS: What are we fucking pretending like--

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:36.485
LAURA: Yeah, fine.

01:45:36.485 --> 01:45:39.998
LIAM: Can we see, well, can Pike, "Can I see into
the hovel?"

01:45:39.998 --> 01:45:42.475
MATT: Do you want to push the door open and have a
look inside?

01:45:42.475 --> 01:45:43.626
LIAM: Oh, it's closed?

01:45:43.626 --> 01:45:44.847
MATT: The door is closed, you can see--

01:45:44.847 --> 01:45:49.765
TRAVIS: Oh, hold on, hold on. There are runes, of
which I can read.

01:45:49.765 --> 01:45:52.576
MARISHA: Oh, five minutes go by, and--?

01:45:52.576 --> 01:45:57.357
TRAVIS: Don't knock it, all right, just be
grateful. Can I try to take a look at the

01:45:57.357 --> 01:45:58.214
Dwarvish?

01:45:58.214 --> 01:45:59.161
MATT: You may.

01:45:59.161 --> 01:46:00.032
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:46:00.032 --> 01:46:01.858
MATT: It takes you roughly 15 or so minutes.

01:46:01.858 --> 01:46:06.802
LAURA: Oh my god, come on! We cannot wait for 15
minutes!

01:46:06.802 --> 01:46:08.872
LIAM: Vax's wings go (poof).

01:46:08.872 --> 01:46:11.613
MATT: Yeah, the wings vanish. You can take a short
rest if you guys would like to.

01:46:11.613 --> 01:46:13.017
LAURA: While he's doing that?

01:46:13.017 --> 01:46:14.126
TRAVIS: I'm Professor X.

01:46:14.126 --> 01:46:16.239
MATT: It'll take a while, so it means you lose
your invisibility--

01:46:16.239 --> 01:46:18.241
MARISHA: I mean, might as well.

01:46:18.241 --> 01:46:24.290
MATT: All right so you guys can take your hit dice
as a short rest. Your form reverts, which if you

01:46:24.290 --> 01:46:29.258
wanted to try and peek within, you couldn't anyway,
because it's worked stone so you can't glide through that.

01:46:29.258 --> 01:46:38.274
The words you pull out from this are, "The
last king, stalwart warrior of our mountain

01:46:38.274 --> 01:46:44.450
"secrets, his might unmatched, his will unbroken,
his passing invites the madness."

01:46:44.450 --> 01:46:54.327
TRAVIS: Shit, okay, all right. It's been worth the
wait. It is the last king, there's like a secret

01:46:54.327 --> 01:47:02.629
buried with him and his death brought on the
madness. So like, there's definitely treasure with

01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:04.318
him down there.

01:47:04.318 --> 01:47:06.394
MARISHA: Unless it's already been raided?

01:47:06.394 --> 01:47:10.195
TALIESIN: I think he's still in there and he's
maybe been turning people mad.

01:47:10.195 --> 01:47:12.495
That would be my guess.

01:47:12.495 --> 01:47:13.645
LIAM: The last king.

01:47:13.645 --> 01:47:14.734
SAM: There's a king in there?

01:47:14.734 --> 01:47:15.973
LAURA: What, say it again?

01:47:15.973 --> 01:47:20.095
TRAVIS: He's the last king, there's like, the
secret with--

01:47:20.095 --> 01:47:22.313
MATT: "Stalwart warrior of our mountain secrets."

01:47:22.313 --> 01:47:24.184
SAM: Mountain dwarf?

01:47:24.184 --> 01:47:27.360
MARISHA: Stalwart warrior of our mountain
secrets.

01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:34.064
LIAM: "When I'm turning undead, if they're like
little piddly guys, they blow up, but if he's a

01:47:34.064 --> 01:47:36.034
"king he might not blow up."

01:47:36.034 --> 01:47:37.241
TALIESIN: Okay, then we can--

01:47:37.241 --> 01:47:41.547
LIAM: "So he might get scared of me, or nothing,
I don't know?"

01:47:41.547 --> 01:47:46.449
SAM: (laughs) Double Pike is the best Pike.

01:47:46.449 --> 01:47:49.886
MATT: Grog, you do not get a short rest
unfortunately.

01:47:49.886 --> 01:47:50.914
TRAVIS: Nope.

01:47:50.914 --> 01:47:52.122
MATT: Because you were studying.

01:47:52.122 --> 01:47:53.650
TRAVIS: Thank you. I'm working real hard.

01:47:53.650 --> 01:47:59.451
SAM: Hey, for hit point counts here, I'm under the
impression that we had some bonus hit points from

01:47:59.451 --> 01:48:03.018
some speech or something? Do we heal those as
well?

01:48:03.018 --> 01:48:03.807
TALIESIN: No.

01:48:03.807 --> 01:48:04.706
MARISHA: Yes.

01:48:04.706 --> 01:48:05.602
TALIESIN: Oh, you do?

01:48:05.602 --> 01:48:07.622
MARISHA: Yeah, it's plus 18 to your maximum hit
points.

01:48:07.622 --> 01:48:10.471
MATT: No, no, no, that's from Heroes Feast.

01:48:10.471 --> 01:48:11.968
SAM: Which we did not do.

01:48:11.968 --> 01:48:15.619
MARISHA: Oh, I'm sorry, it's just temporary hit
points.

01:48:15.619 --> 01:48:17.222
MATT: It's temporary hit points from your
speech.

01:48:17.222 --> 01:48:22.094
MARISHA: But you don't get them back. Right,
right, okay.

01:48:22.094 --> 01:48:23.745
TRAVIS: When they're gone, they're gone.

01:48:23.745 --> 01:48:25.099
MARISHA: Then, yeah.

01:48:25.099 --> 01:48:28.991
TRAVIS: What do you think, should we dig him up,
or move on?

01:48:28.991 --> 01:48:33.233
SAM: Time is of the essence.

01:48:33.233 --> 01:48:37.560
LIAM: "Well, time is of the essence, he could have
something useful. It seems like a coin flip."

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:42.613
TRAVIS: It says he has a secret with him. Right?
Like a secret? A prize?

01:48:42.613 --> 01:48:45.214
MATT: All it says is "stalwart warrior of our
mountain secrets".

01:48:45.214 --> 01:48:47.485
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, a "'stow' of our mountain
secrets."

01:48:47.485 --> 01:48:49.212
LIAM: "That's tempting," Liam said.

01:48:49.212 --> 01:48:51.042
LAURA: You should open the door.

01:48:51.042 --> 01:48:52.037
LIAM: Yeah, of course.

01:48:52.037 --> 01:48:53.330
LAURA: &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; should open the door.

01:48:53.330 --> 01:48:54.537
LIAM: Yeah, all right, so--

01:48:54.537 --> 01:48:58.443
TALIESIN: We are nasty enough that if we have to
put this thing down, we put this thing down.

01:48:58.443 --> 01:49:06.506
LIAM: Pickle, are you ready to go? "Yeah!" Okay,
shhh. I'm going to try and open it

01:49:06.506 --> 01:49:07.780
as silent as possible.

01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:08.929
MATT: Make a strength check.

01:49:08.929 --> 01:49:10.032
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Strength&lt;/i&gt; check?

01:49:10.032 --> 01:49:11.131
MATT: It's a heavy stone door.

01:49:11.131 --> 01:49:12.043
LIAM: Good grief.

01:49:12.043 --> 01:49:14.995
MATT: Partially buried in rubble. It's not locked
but it is somewhat--

01:49:14.995 --> 01:49:16.505
LIAM: 16.

01:49:16.505 --> 01:49:17.466
MATT: 16?

01:49:17.466 --> 01:49:18.380
LIAM: Yeah.

01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:20.764
MATT: For you? Is Pike helping?

01:49:20.764 --> 01:49:21.617
LAURA: Yeah!

01:49:21.617 --> 01:49:22.618
LIAM: Yeah, sure.

01:49:22.618 --> 01:49:28.084
MATT: Have Pike roll as well. Her strength is 19
so it's +4 to what she rolls.

01:49:28.084 --> 01:49:30.438
LAURA: 16.

01:49:30.438 --> 01:49:37.820
MATT: Okay, you both (grunting). It shifts like a
quarter inch and then locks into place from

01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:38.734
something.

01:49:38.734 --> 01:49:39.841
LIAM: Enough to see in?

01:49:39.841 --> 01:49:41.240
MATT: No. The doors are about that thick.

01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:42.480
LIAM: "Grog--"

01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:45.823
TRAVIS: And I walk up and fucking hammer that
shit.

01:49:45.823 --> 01:49:47.214
LAURA: No, Grog!!

01:49:47.214 --> 01:49:51.124
LIAM: Pike goes like this (yells) as soon as the
door opens.

01:49:51.124 --> 01:49:53.835
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll an attack.

01:49:53.835 --> 01:49:55.006
TALIESIN: Titanstone Knuckles?

01:49:55.006 --> 01:49:56.695
TRAVIS: Yeah. Double damage!

01:49:56.695 --> 01:49:57.673
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:49:57.673 --> 01:50:00.343
LIAM: I mean, as soon as Pike sees him flex, she's
got her hands--

01:50:00.343 --> 01:50:01.641
LAURA: Ready to Turn Undead.

01:50:01.641 --> 01:50:03.123
TRAVIS: 17.

01:50:03.123 --> 01:50:07.257
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll damage.
We'll say 1d4 for your fists

01:50:07.257 --> 01:50:08.697
plus your strength modifier.

01:50:08.697 --> 01:50:11.506
TRAVIS: Ten!

01:50:11.506 --> 01:50:16.348
MATT: Ten. So that's 20 points of damage, because
it's doubled. As you slam your fist into the stone

01:50:16.348 --> 01:50:22.310
door, the door cracks and part of it
splinters and falls, toppling past your

01:50:22.310 --> 01:50:27.240
shoulders and bouncing you in the head a bit. The door
suffered severe damage and probably wouldn't

01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:28.535
sustain another blow.

01:50:28.535 --> 01:50:31.009
MARISHA: I mean--

01:50:31.009 --> 01:50:32.182
TALIESIN: Go ahead.

01:50:32.182 --> 01:50:34.435
TRAVIS: Fee fi fo fum!

01:50:34.435 --> 01:50:36.350
MATT: (laughs) Roll an attack again.

01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:40.902
TRAVIS: That is a 15.

01:50:40.902 --> 01:50:44.752
MATT: 15, yeah, that's enough. That's just enough.
You slam a second time, you don't have to roll

01:50:44.752 --> 01:50:48.930
damage. Even with the additional modifier it's
enough. The door (crumbling) crumples inward and

01:50:48.930 --> 01:50:55.304
falls inside the actual chamber as your fist turns
it into shattered rock and dust.

01:50:55.304 --> 01:50:57.753
LAURA: Can Pike see undead in there?

01:50:57.753 --> 01:50:59.336
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:50:59.336 --> 01:51:02.586
TRAVIS: I'll make a perception check too. I'm at
the doorway.

01:51:02.586 --> 01:51:06.452
LAURA: Plus 11? 20.

01:51:06.452 --> 01:51:07.827
MATT: Okay.

01:51:07.827 --> 01:51:09.175
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

01:51:09.175 --> 01:51:12.852
MATT: Okay, as you guys glance inside briefly this
ten-foot wide-- well, it's actually more like a

01:51:12.852 --> 01:51:20.649
six-foot wide door side on this point, glancing
inside it's another circular chamber that's like

01:51:20.649 --> 01:51:26.795
an outer hallway maybe five feet wide, six feet
wide, and an interior chamber. It looks like a

01:51:26.795 --> 01:51:30.702
smaller cylinder on the inside that is currently
locked. You don't see anything within there. You

01:51:30.702 --> 01:51:35.596
see to the right immediately the rockslide has
filled most of the chamber and comes to rest just

01:51:35.596 --> 01:51:50.158
about the corner of a single large antique bronze
door that's pushed into this central chamber about

01:51:50.158 --> 01:51:51.506
15 feet wide.

01:51:51.506 --> 01:51:53.663
LIAM: Vax catches Pike's shoulder. Hold on, let me
look.

01:51:53.663 --> 01:51:59.358
MATT: You glance off to your left and you can see
along the other side, there are five pedestals

01:51:59.358 --> 01:52:07.847
that curve around this side, each containing a
stone box about that big, on each pedestal.

01:52:07.847 --> 01:52:09.209
TALIESIN: What?!

01:52:09.209 --> 01:52:15.614
MATT: Otherwise, all around the ground here are
broken rocks and shattered statue bits from the

01:52:15.614 --> 01:52:24.108
rockslide. They pushed it inside. It's a mess
across the ground from the impact of the

01:52:24.108 --> 01:52:27.391
rockslide. So, what are you guys doing?

01:52:27.391 --> 01:52:29.909
LIAM: I'm checking the boxes for traps. And the
door.

01:52:29.909 --> 01:52:33.075
LAURA: Can we see anything that points to what
deity it is from inside the chamber? Can we see

01:52:33.075 --> 01:52:34.044
anything?

01:52:34.044 --> 01:52:40.913
MATT: Glancing around? You can't make another
religion check on one you've already failed.

01:52:40.913 --> 01:52:42.115
LAURA: Oh, yeah, no.

01:52:42.115 --> 01:52:44.641
MATT: So you don't see anything that comes across
as religious iconography.

01:52:44.641 --> 01:52:46.834
LAURA: What about Pike though, because she's
looking in.

01:52:46.834 --> 01:52:48.546
MATT: Sure, make a religion check for Pike.

01:52:48.546 --> 01:52:51.272
TALIESIN: Feel you. I feel you.

01:52:51.272 --> 01:52:52.458
LIAM: Plus seven.

01:52:52.458 --> 01:52:53.965
LAURA: 13.

01:52:53.965 --> 01:52:58.731
MATT: 13? No religious iconography seems to catch
your attention. What did you roll for the--?

01:52:58.731 --> 01:53:00.836
LIAM: 19 for the investigation.

01:53:00.836 --> 01:53:02.356
MATT: 19 for the investigation.

01:53:02.356 --> 01:53:03.610
LIAM: The door and boxes.

01:53:03.610 --> 01:53:07.328
MATT: Okay. Glancing at the first box, it does not
appear to be locked. It does

01:53:07.328 --> 01:53:08.324
appear to be trapped.

01:53:08.324 --> 01:53:11.503
LIAM: Okay. Here we go.

01:53:11.503 --> 01:53:14.196
LAURA: You're going to try to undo the trap?

01:53:14.196 --> 01:53:18.123
MATT: Yep, so go ahead and make a roll, your
dexterity and your proficiency modifier.

01:53:18.123 --> 01:53:20.746
LIAM: Thieves' tool, yeah. That's fine.

01:53:20.746 --> 01:53:23.271
TRAVIS: Should we clear out of here while you work
on this bomb?

01:53:23.271 --> 01:53:24.861
LIAM: Yeah!

01:53:24.861 --> 01:53:26.981
TRAVIS: We're all going to get out of the
chamber.

01:53:26.981 --> 01:53:28.881
MATT: Okay, so you all clear out of the chamber.

01:53:28.881 --> 01:53:29.824
LIAM: 30.

01:53:29.824 --> 01:53:35.228
MATT: 30, okay. You find there's actually a pressure
cartridge at the very top of the box, so you slip

01:53:35.228 --> 01:53:40.813
your dagger in, so it remains depressed. As you
lift the lid, you put your thumb over it and hold

01:53:40.813 --> 01:53:43.834
it, trap never triggers. Looking inside, it's
empty.

01:53:43.834 --> 01:53:46.857
LIAM: (shutting noise)

01:53:46.857 --> 01:53:48.300
MATT: (shutting noise) No problem.

01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:50.251
LIAM: Just go down the line.

01:53:50.251 --> 01:53:52.331
MATT: All right. Investigation check on the next
one.

01:53:52.331 --> 01:53:54.115
TRAVIS: Five of them, on pedestals.

01:53:54.115 --> 01:53:58.126
LAURA: (groans) Luck?

01:53:58.126 --> 01:53:59.106
LIAM: Yeah.

01:53:59.106 --> 01:54:00.144
LAURA: Okay, good.

01:54:00.144 --> 01:54:01.018
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

01:54:01.018 --> 01:54:03.606
LIAM: (laughs) That's a 29.

01:54:03.606 --> 01:54:04.713
MATT: You rolled a 29?

01:54:04.713 --> 01:54:05.736
LIAM: With Luck.

01:54:05.736 --> 01:54:07.010
MATT: Okay, this one is not locked, is trapped.

01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:13.023
LIAM: Okay, here we go. That's fine. That's a 27.

01:54:13.023 --> 01:54:19.235
MATT: 27, okay. Similar depression plate, so the
dagger opens it up. It's empty.

01:54:19.235 --> 01:54:23.414
LIAM: I did one, two, let's jump to five.

01:54:23.414 --> 01:54:25.318
MATT: Okay, go for it.

01:54:25.318 --> 01:54:29.972
LAURA: Are you making sure nothing's invisible in
there?

01:54:29.972 --> 01:54:36.307
LIAM: No. Are you here?

01:54:36.307 --> 01:54:38.078
LAURA: I'm peeking in the door.

01:54:38.078 --> 01:54:39.425
LIAM: Did you whisper it to me?

01:54:39.425 --> 01:54:40.427
LAURA: Yeah.

01:54:40.427 --> 01:54:42.285
LIAM: They don't relock when I go?

01:54:42.285 --> 01:54:43.768
LAURA: They're not locking.

01:54:43.768 --> 01:54:48.537
LIAM: My sister's hounding me at the door, so I'm
going to go back and twiddle my finger inside the

01:54:48.537 --> 01:54:49.701
empty boxes.

01:54:49.701 --> 01:54:52.251
LAURA: You were shutting them as you went.

01:54:52.251 --> 01:54:54.680
LIAM: Yeah, but I can reopen them. They don't
relock, do they?

01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:56.680
LAURA: It's not that they were locked. They were
trapped.

01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:57.856
LIAM: But retrap, I mean?

01:54:57.856 --> 01:54:59.520
MATT: They are re-trapped but you've already known
the traps--

01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:01.526
LIAM: So I'll go do this inside.

01:55:01.526 --> 01:55:03.122
MATT: Nothing.

01:55:03.122 --> 01:55:05.239
LAURA: Just wanted to double check!

01:55:05.239 --> 01:55:07.927
LIAM: I go to box five.

01:55:07.927 --> 01:55:08.959
MATT: Okay.

01:55:08.959 --> 01:55:15.698
LIAM: Oh, that's great. Yeah, that works. That was
investigation and it's 26?

01:55:15.698 --> 01:55:19.637
MATT: 26? It's not locked. It is trapped.

01:55:19.637 --> 01:55:27.642
LIAM: That is a 33? Yeah.

01:55:27.642 --> 01:55:33.190
MATT: 33. Similar trap setup, different placement
of the depression plate on the inside of the box

01:55:33.190 --> 01:55:36.132
lid. You find it, hold it, open it up. Empty.

01:55:36.132 --> 01:55:38.363
LAURA: Ah, it's all empty?

01:55:38.363 --> 01:55:39.771
TALIESIN: Two more.

01:55:39.771 --> 01:55:40.800
LIAM: Two more.

01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:45.126
LIAM: Let's go to box number three. There's three
and four left.

01:55:45.126 --> 01:55:46.202
MATT: Okay.

01:55:46.202 --> 01:55:50.900
LAURA: I look over at Percy. It makes me far too
uncomfortable how excited you are about this.

01:55:50.900 --> 01:55:52.720
TALIESIN: This could be very good.

01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:53.919
LIAM: 18.

01:55:53.919 --> 01:55:57.979
MATT: 18. All right, you check. It is not locked.
It is not trapped.

01:55:57.979 --> 01:55:59.341
(groaning)

01:55:59.341 --> 01:56:01.648
LAURA: Oh no, oh no, you rolled too low!

01:56:01.648 --> 01:56:05.730
MATT: Okay, you lift the lid, putting the
dagger where the other depressions were.

01:56:05.730 --> 01:56:07.168
LIAM: I'm leaning back.

01:56:07.168 --> 01:56:12.221
MATT: As you pull it back, there's a (cloud
explosion) of a purplish-black cloud of some sort

01:56:12.221 --> 01:56:15.672
of vapor that immediately bursts into your face.
Make a constitution saving throw.

01:56:15.672 --> 01:56:19.732
LAURA: It's okay. Well, it's not okay. He's got
better constitution.

01:56:19.732 --> 01:56:21.784
LIAM: Good. 20.

01:56:21.784 --> 01:56:28.046
MATT: 20. You manage to just in time hold your
breath and what bit gets into your lungs your body

01:56:28.046 --> 01:56:36.683
instinctually pushes against. Your semi-living
form pushes the toxins from your system.

01:56:36.683 --> 01:56:39.215
You only suffer--

01:56:39.215 --> 01:56:43.426
LAURA: 75 points of poison damage.

01:56:43.426 --> 01:56:45.142
MATT: No, you only suffer eight points of poison
damage.

01:56:45.142 --> 01:56:46.429
TALIESIN: Ah, there you go.

01:56:46.429 --> 01:56:47.946
LIAM: Let's do one more.

01:56:47.946 --> 01:56:49.238
TALIESIN: Anything in the box?

01:56:49.238 --> 01:56:50.623
MATT: Box is empty.

01:56:50.623 --> 01:56:52.041
TALIESIN: Last box!

01:56:52.041 --> 01:56:54.587
TRAVIS: You are not doing this to us!

01:56:54.587 --> 01:57:00.484
LIAM: 19.

01:57:00.484 --> 01:57:02.284
MATT: 19. Not locked, not trapped.

01:57:02.284 --> 01:57:03.927
TALIESIN: Hold your breath.

01:57:03.927 --> 01:57:05.511
TRAVIS: Look at his eyes! Look at his eyes!

01:57:05.511 --> 01:57:13.041
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to hold my breath and--
wait, wait, wait.

01:57:13.041 --> 01:57:16.992
SAM: Need some help in there?

01:57:16.992 --> 01:57:22.787
LIAM: Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I 
take up Whisper and I go (unlocking)

01:57:22.787 --> 01:57:24.482
(wind blowing) and throw it at the wall.

01:57:24.482 --> 01:57:26.983
MATT: Okay. So you throw Whisper and pull the lid
up?

01:57:26.983 --> 01:57:27.930
LIAM: Yep.

01:57:27.930 --> 01:57:32.533
MATT: As you pull the lid up, (trap triggers) the
same toxic fume emanates from it but you are not

01:57:32.533 --> 01:57:39.339
there in the space, instead appearing right next to the
central cylindrical platform in the center of the

01:57:39.339 --> 01:57:44.087
chamber and look back and the cloud slowly
dissipates around. The lid has now fallen back

01:57:44.087 --> 01:57:45.236
into place.

01:57:45.236 --> 01:57:46.346
TRAVIS: Aw, shit!

01:57:46.346 --> 01:57:47.484
MARISHA: That was hot.

01:57:47.484 --> 01:57:49.484
LIAM: I walk over to it (finger swirling sound).

01:57:49.484 --> 01:57:51.026
MATT: Well, the lid fell back in place.

01:57:51.026 --> 01:57:55.314
LIAM: Oh, I did that to the top! I open it up
(finger swirling sound).

01:57:55.314 --> 01:57:56.668
MATT: Okay, you open it up. Make a constitution
saving throw.

01:57:56.668 --> 01:57:57.751
LIAM: Yes!

01:57:57.751 --> 01:57:59.560
MATT: As it (cloud explosion) sprays in the air--

01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:01.722
LIAM: It does it again?! It didn't expend?!

01:58:01.722 --> 01:58:03.806
MATT: These don't!

01:58:03.806 --> 01:58:08.904
LIAM: I would've thought there'd be a little
container--

01:58:08.904 --> 01:58:11.482
MATT: They reset when they close!

01:58:11.482 --> 01:58:14.825
LIAM: With what?! Are there a bunch of gnomes down
there?!

01:58:14.825 --> 01:58:16.469
TALIESIN: It's like a paintball gun.

01:58:16.469 --> 01:58:21.990
MATT: It's like there's magic in the world,
Liam, that allows you to fly 400 feet a round!

01:58:21.990 --> 01:58:25.390
LIAM: I'm just going to take it, a 14, that's not
good enough.

01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:27.640
MATT: No, it's not good enough-- Oh! No, actually
14 is just what you needed.

01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:28.713
LAURA: Oh!

01:58:28.713 --> 01:58:34.836
MATT: So, you resist it again (pained noise), you
still-- That is only six points of poison damage.

01:58:34.836 --> 01:58:37.955
LIAM: I'm fine, I'm fine, I cough.

01:58:37.955 --> 01:58:40.988
MATT: But you resist the poison from locking into
your system.

01:58:40.988 --> 01:58:42.248
LAURA: That's good.

01:58:42.248 --> 01:58:43.614
MATT: The box is empty.

01:58:43.614 --> 01:58:45.706
LAURA: The box is empty! Was it worth it?

01:58:45.779 --> 01:58:47.597
TALIESIN: What's in the center?

01:58:47.597 --> 01:58:50.503
LIAM: I feel alive-- of what? Of the room?

01:58:50.503 --> 01:58:53.662
MATT: The bronze door.

01:58:53.662 --> 01:58:56.699
SAM: The gift was the adventure.

01:58:56.699 --> 01:59:00.627
TALIESIN: I think that's where the good shit was.
I think this was just to take people out.

01:59:00.627 --> 01:59:04.966
MATT: You get the sense looking around here, based
on the forced entry, that there's probably a good

01:59:04.966 --> 01:59:08.134
chance this place had already been pilfered of
whatever those boxes contained.

01:59:08.134 --> 01:59:12.397
LIAM: You never know. They could've died trying.
And then walked away undead.

01:59:12.397 --> 01:59:14.601
SAM: So, there's literally nothing in here? Or
there's still a sarcophagus?

01:59:14.601 --> 01:59:16.625
LAURA: There's a center cylinder.

01:59:16.625 --> 01:59:21.143
MATT: There's the rockslide, shattered statues
across the ground. There's the empty boxes on the

01:59:21.143 --> 01:59:23.217
pillars, and there's the bronze doorway.

01:59:23.217 --> 01:59:28.035
LAURA: There is an undead thing, maybe one undead
guy got stuck in the middle.

01:59:28.035 --> 01:59:31.348
SAM: So, we should open the bronze door? Right?

01:59:31.348 --> 01:59:32.300
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:35.545
LAURA: You know what, Scanlan, you should probably
bamf inside and see.

01:59:35.545 --> 01:59:36.520
SAM: I could.

01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:37.630
TRAVIS: Do it.

01:59:37.630 --> 01:59:38.457
SAM: Okay.

01:59:38.457 --> 01:59:39.582
LAURA: No, no, I'm joking!

01:59:39.582 --> 01:59:40.830
TRAVIS: No, no, no, do it!

01:59:40.830 --> 01:59:43.755
SAM: I'll go inside and I'll open the door!

01:59:43.755 --> 01:59:44.646
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:59:44.646 --> 01:59:46.622
TALIESIN: The door just opens on it--

01:59:46.622 --> 01:59:49.064
SAM: Is it locked?

01:59:49.064 --> 01:59:51.310
MATT: You go ahead and inspect the door?

01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:52.363
LIAM: Ask your rogue, dude.

01:59:52.363 --> 02:00:01.241
MATT: So, as you go and take a moment and check
the door, there is a bronze image faintly carved

02:00:01.241 --> 02:00:05.750
into it of a stocky dwarven man with a thick beard
that touches his toes. It completely covers the

02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:12.530
front of his body. He wears plated armor that
comes to dangerous, jagged, curved-up points. As

02:00:12.530 --> 02:00:19.415
far as dwarves go, this one looks about as unhappy
and unapproachable as any dwarf, and you've

02:00:19.415 --> 02:00:25.720
encountered some pretty gnarly dwarves in your
time. As you glance down, there does appear to be

02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:35.591
an opening for a key and there is an oval turning
mechanism, like a vault door,

02:00:35.591 --> 02:00:36.948
like a smaller vault.

02:00:36.948 --> 02:00:38.337
SAM: I'm going to check for traps.

02:00:38.337 --> 02:00:40.541
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:00:40.541 --> 02:00:45.724
SAM: I think it's 20.

02:00:45.724 --> 02:00:48.278
MATT: 20? It does not appear to be trapped.

02:00:48.278 --> 02:00:50.640
TRAVIS: Look at that face.

02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:52.668
LIAM: Do you mind if I give a second opinion?

02:00:52.668 --> 02:00:53.941
SAM: Sure.

02:00:53.941 --> 02:01:01.067
LIAM: You know, what could it hurt? Oh, not that good
though. No, lower than what you rolled.

02:01:01.067 --> 02:01:04.378
LAURA: Oh shit. There's no traps.

02:01:04.378 --> 02:01:05.893
LIAM: It's okay, you're good now.

02:01:05.893 --> 02:01:07.236
TRAVIS: We need a key though.

02:01:07.236 --> 02:01:10.351
MATT: Does appear to be locked, though.

02:01:10.351 --> 02:01:16.974
SAM: Oh yeah, maybe you should pick the lock.

02:01:16.974 --> 02:01:19.394
TRAVIS: We need a key. Let me try my--

02:01:19.394 --> 02:01:21.520
LAURA: No, let's just pick his for this.

02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:23.615
LIAM: Natural 20.

02:01:23.615 --> 02:01:25.881
MATT: To?

02:01:25.881 --> 02:01:27.169
LIAM: Pick it.

02:01:27.169 --> 02:01:28.628
MATT: Pick the lock? Okay.

02:01:28.628 --> 02:01:30.312
LAURA: I'm not in this room.

02:01:30.312 --> 02:01:31.952
TALIESIN: I'm in the back, ready.

02:01:31.952 --> 02:01:34.288
LIAM: Pike is, though. She's been doing this for
five minutes.

02:01:34.288 --> 02:01:36.085
MATT: Okay, so you and Pike, you're in the back of
the room.

02:01:36.085 --> 02:01:37.489
TALIESIN: I'm right by the door.

02:01:37.489 --> 02:01:38.672
MATT: What's everyone doing?

02:01:38.672 --> 02:01:40.000
TRAVIS and LAURA: Outside the door.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.944
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm outside, waiting for a call.

02:01:42.944 --> 02:01:44.118
SAM: I'm right next to him.

02:01:44.118 --> 02:01:47.152
MATT: All right. So it's a total of what?

02:01:47.152 --> 02:01:54.839
LIAM: Total of 37. I'm a level 18 rogue!

02:01:54.839 --> 02:01:56.220
MATT: I know!

02:01:56.220 --> 02:01:57.675
TALIESIN: Who just rolled a natural 20!

02:01:57.675 --> 02:02:08.832
MATT: On a lockpick DC of 30, you manage to
somehow find the intricacy of a king dwarf

02:02:08.832 --> 02:02:15.982
sarcophagus sealed door. It takes you a good two
to three minutes to carefully find the proper

02:02:15.982 --> 02:02:24.487
tumblers and hold them without it breaking or
ruining the lock, but you manage to feel something

02:02:24.487 --> 02:02:34.489
shift, and a slight latch mechanism on the other
side go (creaking). At which point, the brass door

02:02:34.489 --> 02:02:42.200
from the front door's jaw goes (door opening) and
pours forth this green fume that fills the entirety of

02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:48.911
the chamber. Scanlan, Pike, and Vax, I need you
and you because you're still in

02:02:48.911 --> 02:02:49.920
the back of the chamber--

02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:51.245
TALIESIN: I'm by the door though.

02:02:51.245 --> 02:02:52.801
LIAM: But you're inside.

02:02:52.801 --> 02:02:56.579
MATT: You said you were back in the chamber by the
door, it's on the outskirt. I need you all to make

02:02:56.579 --> 02:02:58.601
a constitution saving throw, please.

02:02:58.601 --> 02:03:01.580
TRAVIS: It's like we kept asking for it.

02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:03.087
MARISHA: I know.

02:03:03.087 --> 02:03:04.840
SAM: 18, for me.

02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:09.939
MARISHA: Keyleth is in the back facepalming right
about now.

02:03:09.939 --> 02:03:11.243
TALIESIN: 19.

02:03:11.243 --> 02:03:13.373
LIAM: 25.

02:03:13.373 --> 02:03:14.679
MATT: Okay.

02:03:14.679 --> 02:03:16.112
LAURA: Seven.

02:03:16.112 --> 02:03:24.190
MATT: Seven. Okay. You manage to shrug off
whatever this effect the fume is and you all cough

02:03:24.190 --> 02:03:31.173
for a second as it dissipates. Scanlan, Percival,
and Pike, you feel your joints begin to stiffen,

02:03:31.173 --> 02:03:35.656
you feel your skin begin to tighten, and as you
guys try and shift and look around, your whole

02:03:35.656 --> 02:03:45.598
body moves sluggishly. The outside of your body
seems to harden and begin to shift in place. You

02:03:45.598 --> 02:03:49.902
suddenly begin to wonder, those shattered statue
pieces in the ground may have been the last tomb

02:03:49.902 --> 02:03:57.075
robbers who came through here. As you all begin to
realize this and the fume begins to slowly fade

02:03:57.075 --> 02:04:01.326
from the chamber, the rest of you, scared to
enter, I need you to make another constitution

02:04:01.326 --> 02:04:02.640
saving throw.

02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:03.701
TRAVIS: Whoa.

02:04:03.701 --> 02:04:04.805
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:04:04.805 --> 02:04:09.227
MATT: Not you, Vax, you've already made it, but I
need Pike, Percy, and Scanlan to make another.

02:04:09.227 --> 02:04:12.289
MARISHA: Can Keyleth do any type of wind gust to
try and push this away to help?

02:04:12.289 --> 02:04:13.611
MATT: If you'd like to.

02:04:13.611 --> 02:04:15.041
MARISHA: But ahead of time?

02:04:15.041 --> 02:04:18.856
MATT: The effect has already taken place on them,
it's not going to stop it unless they save, but

02:04:18.856 --> 02:04:20.442
you can try and clear the chamber of the fume.

02:04:20.442 --> 02:04:22.529
MARISHA: I'll go ahead and clear the chamber so
they don't have to do this again.

02:04:22.529 --> 02:04:23.954
MATT: All right, so what are you using to do
that?

02:04:23.954 --> 02:04:25.410
MARISHA: Wind gust.

02:04:25.410 --> 02:04:26.694
MATT: It's a 1st-level, correct?

02:04:26.694 --> 02:04:32.331
MATT: So you clear, the fume dissipates out and up
into the chamber, and you diffuse it enough where

02:04:32.331 --> 02:04:34.602
it doesn't seem to have as concentrated an
effect.

02:04:34.602 --> 02:04:40.236
LIAM: Could you say that Vax saw the look of panic
in Pike's eyes and Blessed her in a split second?

02:04:40.236 --> 02:04:42.540
MARISHA: Gust of Wind, 2nd-level spell, sorry.

02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:45.837
MATT: I will say, sure, I'll let that happen.

02:04:45.837 --> 02:04:49.062
SAM: But you won't let me cast Greater
Restoration?

02:04:49.062 --> 02:04:51.733
MATT: You can if you want to.

02:04:51.733 --> 02:04:55.741
SAM: I will cast Greater Restoration.

02:04:55.741 --> 02:04:57.030
MATT: On yourself?

02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:58.091
SAM: On Pike.

02:04:58.091 --> 02:05:03.279
MATT: On Pike, okay. As you reach out and cast
Greater Restoration, it infuses Pike's body and

02:05:03.279 --> 02:05:05.264
the hardening effect fades.

02:05:05.264 --> 02:05:10.737
SAM: But I have to roll another constitution?

02:05:10.737 --> 02:05:12.379
MATT: You and Percival both.

02:05:12.379 --> 02:05:13.672
LAURA: So Pike is--?

02:05:13.672 --> 02:05:14.807
SAM: 13.

02:05:14.807 --> 02:05:18.418
MARISHA: 13 is not good. Oh, fucking hell.

02:05:18.418 --> 02:05:28.327
TALIESIN: I'm going to blow a Resolve. That'll be
fun, because that was bullshit. 18?

02:05:28.327 --> 02:05:36.286
MATT: As Pike shrugs off the effect and the Gust
of Wind clears the rest of the green fume from the

02:05:36.286 --> 02:05:44.301
chamber, you all look back and watch as, locked in
place, frozen stone Percival and Scanlan now adorn

02:05:44.301 --> 02:05:47.928
the chamber like decorative statues, locked in an
expression of--

02:05:47.928 --> 02:05:50.746
LAURA: Pike runs over and casts Greater
Restoration on Scanlan.

02:05:50.746 --> 02:05:53.195
MARISHA: And I cast Greater Restoration on Percy.

02:05:53.195 --> 02:05:56.625
MATT: Okay, so mark off those spells cast for both
of you. And upon touch, each of you, your form

02:05:56.625 --> 02:06:00.302
reverts back and the flesh and color returns 
to your body.

02:06:00.302 --> 02:06:05.986
MARISHA: Can we please stop robbing tombs and get
back to our actual mission?

02:06:05.986 --> 02:06:07.364
SAM: I'm stuck like this!

02:06:07.364 --> 02:06:08.423
LAURA: No, you're not.

02:06:08.423 --> 02:06:10.179
SAM: It didn't work! Oh god!

02:06:10.179 --> 02:06:11.809
LAURA: Scanlan, no you're not.

02:06:11.809 --> 02:06:13.455
TALIESIN: I put my finger in his ear.

02:06:13.455 --> 02:06:15.606
TRAVIS: Shit, we just blew those.

02:06:15.606 --> 02:06:16.931
MARISHA: Can we go?

02:06:16.931 --> 02:06:24.313
MATT: The door's open. And the jaw is not
resetting. It's expended at the time, you don't

02:06:24.313 --> 02:06:29.007
know how long it will take for it to reset. And
you do recognize this is one of those type of

02:06:29.007 --> 02:06:33.378
traps that does reset over time, you just don't know
how much time you have.

02:06:33.378 --> 02:06:35.497
LIAM: Too bad I didn't recognize the last one.

02:06:35.497 --> 02:06:36.638
MATT: Nope.

02:06:36.638 --> 02:06:38.462
TALIESIN: Do we want to open it? We paid for it.

02:06:38.462 --> 02:06:39.453
LIAM: It's open.

02:06:39.453 --> 02:06:40.746
TALIESIN: It's open, what's inside?

02:06:40.746 --> 02:06:41.924
LIAM: Pickle, come on.

02:06:41.924 --> 02:06:43.214
LAURA: She gets ready.

02:06:43.214 --> 02:06:49.597
MATT: Beyond the door, indeed you find the tomb of
the last king. In this cylindrical chamber with

02:06:49.597 --> 02:06:56.002
plain stone walls in the center, you see a single
solid marble rectangular sarcophagus with no lid.

02:06:56.002 --> 02:07:02.674
It is open before you. Within, you see the
mummified skeleton of a dwarf adorned in golden

02:07:02.674 --> 02:07:06.937
decorative armor, the same shape and design that
you saw on the bronze doorway before you entered.

02:07:06.937 --> 02:07:13.145
An intricate hammer made of jet black metal rests
to one side outside of its grasp, and a beautiful

02:07:13.145 --> 02:07:19.189
gray leather belt of square opals wraps around the
center of its body. At which point, the skull goes

02:07:19.189 --> 02:07:20.509
(crackling).

02:07:20.509 --> 02:07:21.932
LAURA: She casts Turn Undead.

02:07:21.932 --> 02:07:24.468
LIAM: She grabs her holy symbol and flips it the
bird and Turns Undead.

02:07:24.468 --> 02:07:30.129
MATT: Okay. As she holds up the holy symbol, the
might of Sarenrae swells within her and blasts

02:07:30.129 --> 02:07:35.876
forth in a shockwave of divine energy and will.
What's her DC?

02:07:35.876 --> 02:07:40.254
LIAM: Wisdom saving throw DC, oh shit, so many
pieces of paper. 18.

02:07:40.254 --> 02:07:48.511
MATT: 18? As the wave blasts past, it sits up,
seemingly unaffected by the effect. (growls) It

02:07:48.511 --> 02:07:54.230
looks like it's coming to. You have one round.
What are you guys doing?

02:07:54.230 --> 02:07:55.550
LIAM: One round?

02:07:55.550 --> 02:07:56.729
TRAVIS: We're not in there.

02:07:56.729 --> 02:08:00.847
MATT: Nope, the rest of you are out. It's one
round before it seems to be-- it's currently

02:08:00.847 --> 02:08:04.403
sitting up in the sarcophagus, its arms reaching
out for the hammer at its side.

02:08:04.403 --> 02:08:08.411
LIAM: I'm going to fill up with three daggers and
dump Divine Smite into the first.

02:08:08.411 --> 02:08:09.890
SAM: Take its weapons.

02:08:09.890 --> 02:08:13.266
MATT: All right. Pike also still has her mace.

02:08:13.266 --> 02:08:15.096
LAURA: Yeah, so she should do that.

02:08:15.096 --> 02:08:17.954
MARISHA: Am I in there from the gust?

02:08:17.954 --> 02:08:22.434
MATT: No, you guys are still outside of the
chamber. They rushed in after healing each other

02:08:22.434 --> 02:08:26.673
and besides, it's a small room, there's only room
for three people to get in there.

02:08:26.673 --> 02:08:31.707
What are you doing?

02:08:31.707 --> 02:08:39.414
LAURA: Pike's going to rush in as he's doing that
and try to rip the hammer away from the body and

02:08:39.414 --> 02:08:41.269
run out of the room.

02:08:41.269 --> 02:08:45.575
MATT: Interesting. Okay. So first, you do your
attack.

02:08:45.575 --> 02:08:47.076
LIAM: 32, 19, 32.

02:08:47.076 --> 02:08:48.899
MATT: The first and the third hit.

02:08:48.899 --> 02:08:52.532
LIAM: Okay, first and third hit. Sneak attack on
the first because assassin, and I'm going to dump

02:08:52.532 --> 02:09:14.219
Smite into it. Three plus eight. Let me get the
dice first. (counting) 41. And the Smite is 3d8

02:09:14.219 --> 02:09:31.025
because it's undead. I said 41, right? 41, 45, 46,
52, doubled is 104. Plus the psychic damage. 109.

02:09:31.025 --> 02:09:32.382
For the first attack.

02:09:32.382 --> 02:09:40.889
MATT: So. Pike doesn't have much of a fight for
the hammer because you watch as daggers jam into

02:09:40.889 --> 02:09:45.852
the ornamental armor, causing it to bend and twist
inward, ruining the breastplate, and the undead

02:09:45.852 --> 02:09:52.537
king falls apart, and before it can sit up, is now
sitting right back down in the sarcophagus.

02:09:52.537 --> 02:09:54.310
LAURA: She's like, "Well!"

02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:56.289
TALIESIN: Take everything.

02:09:56.289 --> 02:10:01.763
LAURA: Check for traps, because we've been there,
darling. We've been there.

02:10:01.763 --> 02:10:03.236
MARISHA: Take his belt.

02:10:03.236 --> 02:10:07.544
LAURA: Check for fucking traps. How about nobody
dies.

02:10:07.544 --> 02:10:10.576
LIAM: Bad experience with coffins.

02:10:10.576 --> 02:10:13.415
TRAVIS: It really didn't go that poorly last
time.

02:10:13.415 --> 02:10:18.764
SAM: I'm going to check the floor for any pressure
plates or anything. Okay. That's a lot. 30.

02:10:18.764 --> 02:10:20.025
MATT: 30.

02:10:20.025 --> 02:10:22.386
LIAM: 22 for my investigation.

02:10:22.386 --> 02:10:28.586
MATT: Okay. The sarcophagus itself is not trapped.
Nothing of the accoutrements appear to be trapped.

02:10:28.586 --> 02:10:35.082
As you're investigating, the floor plates to the
immediate right and left of the sarcophagus to

02:10:35.082 --> 02:10:40.554
where someone would easily wish to reach in, there
are two plates that are trapped.

02:10:40.554 --> 02:10:43.920
SAM: Just work from the floor or from the--

02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:46.945
MATT: From the front, yeah. It's a very small
space, it's meant that if more than one person

02:10:46.945 --> 02:10:51.141
were to-- or if you were to fill the chamber, the
two sides would trigger.

02:10:51.141 --> 02:10:53.393
TALIESIN: Let's get what we need and get out.

02:10:53.393 --> 02:10:55.386
LIAM: Oh no, you can fly over.

02:10:55.386 --> 02:10:58.012
TALIESIN: Before it resets.

02:10:58.012 --> 02:11:06.776
MATT: The bronze plate armor is ruined. It's
decorative, it appears to be more for visual and

02:11:06.776 --> 02:11:15.193
presentation than actual function. So you grab the
dark hammer and the belt. Then you pull out of the

02:11:15.193 --> 02:11:20.243
chamber. The jaw of the open bronze is slowly
(creaking sound).

02:11:20.243 --> 02:11:21.771
LAURA: Get out.

02:11:21.771 --> 02:11:28.590
MATT: You guys exit the chamber, you're now
outside of the cylindrical tomb of the Last King.

02:11:28.590 --> 02:11:31.808
TRAVIS: That was a lot of action. What did you
get?

02:11:31.808 --> 02:11:39.228
LAURA: I found a hammer, Grog. Is it cursed? Can
we tell? If it's cursed? Can we tell if it's bad?

02:11:39.228 --> 02:11:41.422
LIAM: You might be feeling some issues right
now if it were cursed.

02:11:41.422 --> 02:11:43.297
MATT: Anyone have an Identify spell?

02:11:43.297 --> 02:11:47.518
SAM: She might be able to sense good and
evil, no?

02:11:47.518 --> 02:11:49.085
LAURA: I don't know.

02:11:49.085 --> 02:11:51.084
SAM: Or is that for creatures, not for-- That's
for creatures.

02:11:51.084 --> 02:11:53.500
LIAM: I could Detect Good and Evil.

02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:54.768
LAURA: Yeah. Here.

02:11:54.768 --> 02:11:56.144
MATT: It's creatures.

02:11:56.144 --> 02:11:57.164
TRAVIS: Gimme.

02:11:57.164 --> 02:12:00.410
SAM: I can look at it and just look at it. I'll
look at it.

02:12:00.410 --> 02:12:01.888
LAURA: Does it feel magic?

02:12:01.888 --> 02:12:04.992
MATT: Make an arcana check, if you're looking at
it. Sorry.

02:12:04.992 --> 02:12:07.638
SAM: Just looking. 12.

02:12:07.638 --> 02:12:09.764
LAURA: We suck.

02:12:09.764 --> 02:12:18.628
MATT: It's interesting. It's not so much that you
can see any sort of-- there's no runic

02:12:18.628 --> 02:12:27.907
ornamentation it seems on it, but it's like a deep
jet black metal. Make a history check.

02:12:27.907 --> 02:12:33.374
MARISHA: Does it look like the same black metal as
in the tomb?

02:12:33.374 --> 02:12:34.764
SAM: 22.

02:12:34.764 --> 02:12:40.706
MATT: 22. This is adamantine, which is an
extremely rare and hard metal.

02:12:40.706 --> 02:12:41.859
SAM: Wolverine?

02:12:41.859 --> 02:12:49.500
MATT: It's the fantasy equivalent. It's not
technically magically enchanted, but its nature

02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:52.739
makes it a very powerful weapon by the metal that
it's crafted from.

02:12:52.739 --> 02:12:54.953
MARISHA: The hammer?

02:12:54.953 --> 02:12:56.094
MATT: The hammer.

02:12:56.094 --> 02:12:58.144
TRAVIS: Is it a two-handed weapon? Single-handed?

02:12:58.144 --> 02:13:00.511
MATT: It's a warhammer, so it's one-handed.

02:13:00.511 --> 02:13:03.206
TRAVIS: I'm just saying.

02:13:03.206 --> 02:13:04.967
SAM: What's your hammer like?

02:13:04.967 --> 02:13:12.420
TRAVIS: My Dwarven Thrower? It can be single or
double-handed. It's not a warhammer. It flies back

02:13:12.420 --> 02:13:13.934
to my hand, though.

02:13:13.934 --> 02:13:15.296
SAM: Oh, that's pretty cool.

02:13:15.296 --> 02:13:21.221
TRAVIS: It is. But you can never have enough
hammers. Do you mind if I--?

02:13:21.221 --> 02:13:26.049
SAM: No, but I mean, how are you going to wield
this? You have two other weapons, don't you?

02:13:26.049 --> 02:13:31.524
TRAVIS: Are you kidding me? I'm like a fucking
Home Depot of weapons. I got what you need.

02:13:31.524 --> 02:13:32.856
SAM: Sure, go for it.

02:13:32.856 --> 02:13:34.403
LAURA: What about the belt?

02:13:34.403 --> 02:13:36.009
MATT: The belt? Make an arcana check.

02:13:36.009 --> 02:13:39.386
SAM: Let me look at that. I have no idea what that
is.

02:13:39.386 --> 02:13:44.968
TRAVIS: Just because I want to know, can I go up
to the doorway and hit the side of the doorway

02:13:44.968 --> 02:13:47.665
with the adamantine black hammer?

02:13:47.665 --> 02:13:52.436
MATT: It does require attunement to use its effect
or power.

02:13:52.436 --> 02:13:54.204
LAURA: Oh! It needs attunement.

02:13:54.204 --> 02:13:56.018
TRAVIS: Yeah, without attuning. I just hit the
doorway.

02:13:56.018 --> 02:13:59.875
MATT: Okay. It's solid, it's hefty, it's nice. One
of the better hammers you've ever wielded.

02:13:59.875 --> 02:14:02.617
TRAVIS: It's solid. It's hefty. It's one of the
better hammers I've ever wielded.

02:14:02.617 --> 02:14:05.047
SAM: Are you going to unattune from something to
attune to this?

02:14:05.047 --> 02:14:06.034
TRAVIS: No.

02:14:06.034 --> 02:14:07.207
LAURA: Just to have it.

02:14:07.207 --> 02:14:08.270
SAM: Then what is it?

02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:09.210
TRAVIS: Bag of Holding.

02:14:09.210 --> 02:14:11.518
LAURA: This is totally worth it. We don't know
what any of this shit is.

02:14:11.518 --> 02:14:16.167
TALIESIN: We don't know. Let me take a look at
that belt, maybe. Wait, you have to be trained in

02:14:16.167 --> 02:14:17.685
arcana to identify something, don't you?

02:14:17.685 --> 02:14:19.271
MATT: I would say for the most part, yeah.

02:14:19.271 --> 02:14:21.097
TALIESIN: Is there anybody else trained in
arcana?

02:14:21.097 --> 02:14:23.960
MATT: I mean, you can make a base check to give a
glance, but you're not going to be able to learn

02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:26.305
much about the nature of any enchantment if you
find one.

02:14:26.305 --> 02:14:29.439
TALIESIN: Does 23 do anything?

02:14:29.439 --> 02:14:39.219
MATT: I will say looking at it, there does appear to be
runes inscribed very faintly in parts of the

02:14:39.219 --> 02:14:45.159
leather around it and the way the rectangular
opals are set into it, there is a glimmer of some

02:14:45.159 --> 02:14:46.722
sort of enchantment based into it.

02:14:46.722 --> 02:14:48.626
TALIESIN: I want to attune to it and see what
happens.

02:14:48.626 --> 02:14:50.429
MARISHA: We have to take another short rest.

02:14:50.429 --> 02:14:53.081
TALIESIN: Next time, yeah. Let's get a little
further.

02:14:53.081 --> 02:14:55.198
SAM: Next time? We're about to go fight fucking
Vecna.

02:14:55.198 --> 02:15:00.453
TALIESIN: I mean, we're on our way, but we've got
a lot further to go.

02:15:00.453 --> 02:15:04.571
SAM: Well, that was fruitful. Let's keep going.

02:15:04.571 --> 02:15:06.352
TRAVIS: All right. Let's go back to the other
way.

02:15:06.352 --> 02:15:12.810
TALIESIN: I think I'm going to try the belt on and
see what happens.

02:15:12.810 --> 02:15:15.868
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it.

02:15:15.868 --> 02:15:17.101
LIAM: Fred.

02:15:17.101 --> 02:15:18.431
MARISHA: While we're walking?

02:15:18.431 --> 02:15:19.668
LIAM: Freddie.

02:15:19.668 --> 02:15:21.297
TALIESIN: It's obviously enchanted, it doesn't--

02:15:21.297 --> 02:15:24.247
SAM: Who would be buried with a cursed belt?

02:15:24.247 --> 02:15:27.358
TRAVIS: Absolutely you would. Yep. That's exactly
what you would do with it.

02:15:27.358 --> 02:15:32.339
SAM: I think it's a great idea. We're gods now, we
can do anything we want.

02:15:32.339 --> 02:15:36.934
MARISHA: I mean, we have pulled cursed items out
of tombs before.

02:15:36.934 --> 02:15:39.718
SAM: They haven't permanently killed any of us.

02:15:39.718 --> 02:15:40.821
MARISHA: Sure.

02:15:40.821 --> 02:15:42.297
LAURA: You can do what?

02:15:42.297 --> 02:15:47.204
LIAM: I wasn't going to say I could do anything. I
think that's a shitty idea right now.

02:15:47.204 --> 02:15:48.521
MARISHA: We really need to keep moving.

02:15:48.521 --> 02:15:50.667
TRAVIS: We travel back down the---

02:15:50.667 --> 02:15:52.476
LAURA: Yeah, the other fucking direction.

02:15:52.476 --> 02:15:56.881
MATT: All right. So, you head the other way. So,
you're holding off?

02:15:56.881 --> 02:16:01.292
TALIESIN: No, I want to find out, so I'm going to
pull the gloves off and I'm going to put the belt on.

02:16:01.292 --> 02:16:05.521
MATT: Okay, so you begin to attune to it as you
guys are walking, take some time with it.

02:16:05.521 --> 02:16:08.931
TALIESIN and MARISHA: I hope it's great.

02:16:08.931 --> 02:16:14.640
MATT: Following the right path, you continue for
roughly 100 or so feet in a switchback motion.

02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:19.537
Once you're past that portion of the tunnel, it
seems to curve back and it ascends in like a

02:16:19.537 --> 02:16:26.632
switchback path a bit. You can see at this point
more stairs, more carved stone steps are beginning

02:16:26.632 --> 02:16:31.684
to emerge; some of the rough earth that you had
encountered in previous T-intersections seems to

02:16:31.684 --> 02:16:39.030
be falling away to some semblance of actual
holding architecture. And eventually it reveals a

02:16:39.030 --> 02:16:44.331
much larger hall of very apparent dwarven
architecture. The ceiling now pulls up to about 60

02:16:44.331 --> 02:16:49.328
feet above you, stalagmites dripping condensation
from the shadow above, you can hear the distant

02:16:49.328 --> 02:16:56.639
drops in the distance of the cavern before you.
You can make out broken ruins built into the walls

02:16:56.639 --> 02:17:02.499
of each side. Ancient stone homes and structures
that now crack and crumble with each footfall of

02:17:02.499 --> 02:17:08.698
the titan. As you hear the (impact) of the next
heavy footfall, you see as a couple of stones

02:17:08.698 --> 02:17:13.642
tumble from some of these structures, clattering
across the cavern floor.

02:17:13.642 --> 02:17:16.310
LIAM and MATT: Perception check.

02:17:16.310 --> 02:17:18.684
LIAM: Natural 20.

02:17:18.684 --> 02:17:29.551
MATT: Vax. You hear a faint, distant, echoing,
alien sound in the darkness ahead of you.

02:17:29.551 --> 02:17:31.052
LIAM: Far-ish?

02:17:31.052 --> 02:17:33.573
MATT: Further than your visual range.

02:17:33.573 --> 02:17:40.389
LIAM: Further than my visual range. Okay, we've
got company up ahead. So, yeah.

02:17:40.389 --> 02:17:43.759
MARISHA: What kind of an alien language? Any that
we recognize?

02:17:43.759 --> 02:17:51.441
MATT: You hear this faint-- sounds like a voice,
droning, slightly changing pitch, but it's so

02:17:51.441 --> 02:17:56.779
disparate and so distant that you can't make up
anything other than noticing that it exists

02:17:56.779 --> 02:18:03.970
amongst the steady, low, rhythmic rumbles of each
separate footfall of the beast you now currently

02:18:03.970 --> 02:18:05.797
are within.

02:18:05.797 --> 02:18:08.243
TRAVIS: Vax. Go fetch.

02:18:08.243 --> 02:18:10.408
LIAM: Stealth.

02:18:10.408 --> 02:18:13.737
MATT: All right. Make a stealth check.

02:18:13.737 --> 02:18:18.638
LIAM: 30.

02:18:18.638 --> 02:18:26.375
MATT: Okay. As you dart ahead, you come up a few
steps onto a raised thoroughfare amongst the

02:18:26.375 --> 02:18:32.204
various dwarven buildings here. It looks like
there is a crevasse or chasm that this portion of

02:18:32.204 --> 02:18:38.060
the city was built along, and you can see up above
there were platforms where staircases would rise up and there

02:18:38.060 --> 02:18:43.803
were raised buildings built into these chambers
that have since fallen and crumbled down with the

02:18:43.803 --> 02:18:51.761
movement of the titan, leaving these ruined piles of
broken walls, floors, and decorative materials.

02:18:51.761 --> 02:19:03.341
You can see broken and bent dinnerware and
metallic decorative plates or vases that have

02:19:03.341 --> 02:19:10.244
since fallen and crumbled beneath the collapsing
structures. There was once a thriving city that

02:19:10.244 --> 02:19:14.836
you're now getting more glimpses of the further
into this beast you go that has been long deserted

02:19:14.836 --> 02:19:20.661
and now, the longer it travels, it begins to be
erased by the vibrations of the creature's

02:19:20.661 --> 02:19:30.663
movement. As you continue forward, you can see
there's a portion where the-- Couldn't wait, could you?

02:19:30.663 --> 02:19:32.857
TRAVIS: The damn growl. I thought it was a growl.

02:19:32.857 --> 02:19:34.728
LAURA and MATT: It sounded like a growl.

02:19:34.728 --> 02:19:36.907
LIAM: Man, I had to pee so bad, I ran out of the
room.

02:19:36.907 --> 02:19:42.599
MATT: I know. As you crest the top of this upper
area of the road, you glance down and can see a

02:19:42.599 --> 02:19:49.675
portion of it is underwater, there's a small pool
where droplets drop and at the edge of it you can

02:19:49.675 --> 02:19:56.209
barely see the shape of a creature, hunched at the
edge of the waterside.

02:19:56.209 --> 02:19:58.557
LIAM: How close am I to that?

02:19:58.557 --> 02:20:02.197
MATT: It's about 50 to 55 feet from you.

02:20:02.197 --> 02:20:04.889
LIAM: Divine Sense.

02:20:04.889 --> 02:20:08.048
MATT: Okay. Divine Sense to see if--

02:20:08.048 --> 02:20:09.613
LIAM: It's undead.

02:20:09.613 --> 02:20:12.673
MATT: It is not undead; you do not get an undead
sense.

02:20:12.673 --> 02:20:16.269
LIAM: Okay. Or a fiend or a celestial?

02:20:16.269 --> 02:20:21.986
MATT: It's too far away to get a close view at
this point because it's at the edge of your

02:20:21.986 --> 02:20:26.989
darkvision. You can just make out its shape; it's
humanoid, it has two arms, two legs, and it looks

02:20:26.989 --> 02:20:35.271
roughly the size of you or Vex. But you now see
it's sitting at a fallen and partially ruined

02:20:35.271 --> 02:20:40.094
dwarven statue, some sort of structure that was on
a pedestal that had fallen at the edge-- and it's

02:20:40.094 --> 02:20:47.889
sitting over top of it. It's got gray, splotchy
skin, tough exterior, armored spines or plates

02:20:47.889 --> 02:20:52.533
along its back that stick up as it hunches forward
like some sort of porcupine.

02:20:52.533 --> 02:20:56.980
LAURA: Does it look like that thing in the Nine Hells
that we saw? Or in the City of Brass?

02:20:56.980 --> 02:21:05.386
MATT: Not quite, it's smaller than that. You see a
collection of odd trinkets and objects that dangle

02:21:05.386 --> 02:21:13.117
around its waist that clink as it shifts and moves, like a
belt of scavenged trophies. Its claws currently

02:21:13.117 --> 02:21:20.652
tear into some sort of unidentified fleshy limb;
it has clawed fingers. It's digging into it, tears

02:21:20.652 --> 02:21:26.920
a piece of flesh off of it and chews and slurps it
back. It suddenly freezes up--

02:21:26.920 --> 02:21:28.781
LIAM: (daggers whooshing) One two three.

02:21:28.781 --> 02:21:30.750
ALL: Oh.

02:21:30.750 --> 02:21:32.674
MATT: Roll for an attack.

02:21:32.674 --> 02:21:36.401
MARISHA: What if he's nice? What if he's that
random creepy merchant you find in the

02:21:36.401 --> 02:21:37.620
middle of nowhere?

02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:40.678
TRAVIS: Nobody that eats with their hands in the
inside of a titan is nice.

02:21:40.678 --> 02:21:47.987
LIAM: Advantage on all three attacks. First attack
is 29.

02:21:47.987 --> 02:21:49.446
MATT: Okay, that hits.

02:21:49.446 --> 02:21:51.084
LIAM: Second attack.

02:21:51.084 --> 02:21:53.513
SAM: He's just a nice old man.

02:21:53.513 --> 02:22:02.861
LIAM: Second attack is 32. Third attack is 27.

02:22:02.861 --> 02:22:04.964
MATT: That hits.

02:22:04.964 --> 02:22:07.982
LAURA: (gentle old man impression) Thank god
you're here! I've been--

02:22:07.982 --> 02:22:10.195
TALIESIN: There's no throat left.

02:22:10.195 --> 02:22:12.592
MARISHA: (rugged voice) Would you like to see my
wares--

02:22:12.592 --> 02:22:15.559
TRAVIS: I've been freed from my--

02:22:15.559 --> 02:22:20.385
SAM: (gravelly voice) Don't go in the crypt of--

02:22:20.385 --> 02:22:24.075
(laughter)

02:22:24.075 --> 02:22:28.492
MATT: So the first dagger does--

02:22:28.492 --> 02:22:41.892
LIAM: Ten, 14, 17, 23, 24, 48 plus psychic damage.
54 for the first attack.

02:22:41.892 --> 02:22:47.454
MATT: The two daggers hit nothing as the first
dagger strikes and slaughters the creature. And

02:22:47.454 --> 02:22:55.891
hits the water and now floats up, unmoving in the
pond there. You can see the liquid around it

02:22:55.891 --> 02:22:57.366
darkening.

02:22:57.366 --> 02:23:00.134
TALIESIN: You just killed an NPC!

02:23:00.134 --> 02:23:06.130
LIAM: We're not in Emon in the market square!

02:23:06.130 --> 02:23:14.244
MATT: No one knows about this. The sheer force of
the first dagger sends it off the broken statue

02:23:14.244 --> 02:23:16.415
and it falls into the water and it is now
unmoving.

02:23:16.415 --> 02:23:18.574
LIAM: We are in &lt;i&gt;hell&lt;/i&gt;. Perception check.

02:23:18.574 --> 02:23:21.722
TRAVIS: All we know is you're just out there.

02:23:21.722 --> 02:23:27.786
MATT: You guys do hear this distant echoing
(creature dying) that echoes throughout the

02:23:27.786 --> 02:23:28.760
chamber.

02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:29.970
LIAM: 31.

02:23:29.970 --> 02:23:32.789
MATT: Okay, you glance around. Nothing else seems
to be moving in the chamber.

02:23:32.789 --> 02:23:34.491
LIAM: All right, I'm going to sneak up to it.

02:23:34.491 --> 02:23:40.621
MATT: Okay. You move up to it, you can see now
it's hunched in the water, its face is under the

02:23:40.621 --> 02:23:50.387
ground. The water itself is maybe waist deep at
most, and it's there floating in the liquid.

02:23:50.387 --> 02:23:52.798
SAM: It was holding a baby.

02:23:52.798 --> 02:23:57.088
LIAM: Flame Tongue is out, what am I looking at?

02:23:57.088 --> 02:24:03.358
MATT: Do you want to look at its face?

02:24:03.358 --> 02:24:04.497
LIAM: Yeah.

02:24:04.497 --> 02:24:11.772
MATT: Okay, as you pull one of the spines and pull
it back, you can see toothy jaws, humanoid-like,

02:24:11.772 --> 02:24:16.901
but grey and coming to a point where you can see
jagged teeth in the top and bottom row, and one

02:24:16.901 --> 02:24:21.696
singular large yellowish eye in the center of its
face, no nose, and the eye is

02:24:21.696 --> 02:24:23.511
slightly rolled back.

02:24:23.511 --> 02:24:30.785
LIAM: Liam knows what this thing is, but Vax does
not. Fuck this thing! I'm going to start looking--

02:24:30.785 --> 02:24:33.284
what are the trinkets on it?

02:24:33.284 --> 02:24:35.161
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:24:35.161 --> 02:24:38.272
LAURA: You don't know what Matt would've done with
whatever you think!

02:24:38.272 --> 02:24:39.759
LIAM: Oh, he could do anything!

02:24:39.759 --> 02:24:41.621
MARISHA: Yeah, Clarota was nice!

02:24:41.621 --> 02:24:46.980
LIAM: Was he? Did you say investigation or
perception?

02:24:46.980 --> 02:24:48.257
MATT: Investigation.

02:24:48.257 --> 02:24:54.382
LIAM: Investigation, all right, thank you. Some
weird energy tonight, guys. 19.

02:24:54.382 --> 02:25:00.395
MATT: 19. Okay. A lot of them appear to be bones,
many of them ancient, and a couple of them look to

02:25:00.395 --> 02:25:05.647
be more fresh. There's a filth-encrusted dagger
that's hanging from the side, an empty scroll

02:25:05.647 --> 02:25:15.273
case, a spyglass, half of a book that looks like
it's old and rotten and falling apart, and a

02:25:15.273 --> 02:25:17.103
singular bronze key.

02:25:17.103 --> 02:25:25.345
LIAM: I rip off the spyglass and go, oh, that looks
nerdy, Percy will like that, and then I yank off

02:25:25.345 --> 02:25:31.232
the dagger and go, that looks all right, and I
stick it in the Blinkback Belt and then-- what was

02:25:31.232 --> 02:25:36.543
the last thing? It was a key. To the bronze door
right, yeah.

02:25:36.543 --> 02:25:39.952
MATT: Looking at the shape and size of it, it
probably would have fit pretty

02:25:39.952 --> 02:25:41.754
snugly into that door.

02:25:41.754 --> 02:25:44.892
LIAM: In the dark by myself. Oh, that is fucking
hilarious.

02:25:44.892 --> 02:25:48.611
TRAVIS: No book?

02:25:48.611 --> 02:25:51.891
LIAM: The tattered remains of the book? Eh.

02:25:51.891 --> 02:25:53.460
MATT: You don't recognize the language.

02:25:53.460 --> 02:25:58.574
LIAM: Eh. I don't. I let it sink back into the
water.

02:25:58.574 --> 02:26:00.537
MATT: Okay. Well, it's still floating.

02:26:00.537 --> 02:26:05.948
TRAVIS: Vax. What did you find up ahead?

02:26:05.948 --> 02:26:11.944
LIAM: A one eyed, one horned, swimming, purple,
people-- Come on up, please,

02:26:11.944 --> 02:26:13.429
we should keep moving.

02:26:13.429 --> 02:26:15.042
TRAVIS: All right. We join him.

02:26:15.042 --> 02:26:19.342
MATT: All right. You guys approach carefully,
walking through the center of this twisting chasm.

02:26:19.342 --> 02:26:26.794
You come over the rise of the central road and
descend to meet up with Vax where you see there

02:26:26.794 --> 02:26:28.627
was the pool and the floating creature.

02:26:28.627 --> 02:26:30.802
LAURA: Eww. What is that? Do any of us know what
it was?

02:26:30.802 --> 02:26:33.224
TALIESIN: Am I starting to get a vibe or am I not
starting to get a vibe?

02:26:33.224 --> 02:26:34.062
MATT: Of?

02:26:34.062 --> 02:26:34.967
TALIESIN: The belt.

02:26:34.967 --> 02:26:37.418
MATT: Oh, the belt? Okay, I'd say at this point.
Sure.

02:26:37.418 --> 02:26:38.795
TALIESIN: Starting to get a vibe?

02:26:38.795 --> 02:26:39.686
MATT: Sure.

02:26:39.686 --> 02:26:40.681
SAM: Ooh.

02:26:40.681 --> 02:26:41.825
MARISHA: Is it vibey?

02:26:41.825 --> 02:26:43.332
TALIESIN: It says. Okay.

02:26:43.332 --> 02:26:47.319
LAURA: Read it out loud.

02:26:47.319 --> 02:26:50.247
SAM: I don't even know how to pronounce that first
word.

02:26:50.247 --> 02:26:53.678
TALIESIN: The attuned gains resistance to psychic
damage, in addition they are immune to being

02:26:53.678 --> 02:26:56.066
paralyzed or petrified and cannot be knocked
prone.

02:26:56.066 --> 02:26:57.965
TRAVIS: Okay, that's fucking clutch.

02:26:57.965 --> 02:26:59.786
LAURA: Okay, that's really big.

02:26:59.786 --> 02:27:02.878
TALIESIN: As an action you can channel your anger
to produce a shockwave of thunderous energy, as

02:27:02.878 --> 02:27:09.022
with the Thunderwave spell. DC 16, cast at fifth
level. You cannot use this feature until you

02:27:09.022 --> 02:27:10.391
finish a short rest.

02:27:10.391 --> 02:27:11.521
SAM: How do you pronounce that first name?

02:27:11.521 --> 02:27:13.425
MARISHA: Cincture. Cincture of the Stone King.

02:27:13.425 --> 02:27:14.881
SAM: Cinc-ture?

02:27:14.881 --> 02:27:18.509
MARISHA: Cincture. It's like Spanx. We should call
it Spanx of the Stone King.

02:27:18.509 --> 02:27:20.434
SAM: How do you know that?

02:27:20.434 --> 02:27:21.796
TALIESIN: How do you not?

02:27:21.796 --> 02:27:24.565
SAM: Oh, it's like, people still make these
things?

02:27:24.565 --> 02:27:27.419
MARISHA: It's like a cincture. Like Spanx.

02:27:27.419 --> 02:27:30.922
SAM: Oh, I've never seen that word before.

02:27:30.922 --> 02:27:35.956
LIAM: Oh, Freddie. Get excited. I found a spyglass
covered in diarrhea. Would you like it?

02:27:35.956 --> 02:27:40.436
TALIESIN: Yes. Clean it, please.

02:27:40.436 --> 02:27:43.745
LAURA: What is this creature? Do we know what
this creature is?

02:27:43.745 --> 02:27:47.725
MATT: This would be an arcana check on this one,
actually.

02:27:47.725 --> 02:27:50.664
TRAVIS: Because he's enjoying his belt, can I take
out--

02:27:50.664 --> 02:27:52.634
MATT: Is anyone here trained in arcana?

02:27:52.634 --> 02:27:53.688
LAURA: Scanlan.

02:27:53.688 --> 02:27:56.971
SAM: Well, I'm not proficient in it, weirdly, but
I am an arcanist.

02:27:56.971 --> 02:28:00.104
MATT: Yeah, make a check with disadvantage.

02:28:00.104 --> 02:28:01.921
SAM: Seven.

02:28:01.921 --> 02:28:03.287
LAURA: With disadvantage.

02:28:03.287 --> 02:28:04.389
SAM: Four.

02:28:04.389 --> 02:28:06.688
MATT: You're not entirely certain what this is.

02:28:06.688 --> 02:28:09.726
TALIESIN: Is that with your arcana?

02:28:09.726 --> 02:28:11.426
SAM: I mean, it's ten.

02:28:11.426 --> 02:28:14.004
LAURA: Oh, well that's better than four.

02:28:14.004 --> 02:28:15.972
SAM: Yeah, but it's still sucky.

02:28:15.972 --> 02:28:21.673
TRAVIS: Could I take out the black metallic hammer
now that he's all excited about his belt and begin

02:28:21.673 --> 02:28:23.422
my attuning period?

02:28:23.422 --> 02:28:27.015
MATT: Okay. So you're going to attune. Are you
guys going to wait for him or are you going to

02:28:27.015 --> 02:28:28.335
walk with him as--

02:28:28.335 --> 02:28:30.054
SAM: No we're not fucking waiting for--

02:28:30.054 --> 02:28:34.085
MATT: Okay, you look at the creature and leave it
there in the water. You begin concentrating on the

02:28:34.085 --> 02:28:36.599
hammer. What are you unattuning from to take its
place?

02:28:36.599 --> 02:28:37.948
TRAVIS: Instead of the Bloodaxe.

02:28:37.948 --> 02:28:42.996
MATT: Okay. So you set the Bloodaxe away and
attune to the adamantine hammer as you begin to trek

02:28:42.996 --> 02:28:44.250
further into--

02:28:44.250 --> 02:28:48.451
LAURA: Is there anything else interesting in this
cavern? That we can see?

02:28:48.451 --> 02:28:52.793
MATT: We'll get to that in a minute. As you begin
to leave the watered pool to head further into

02:28:52.793 --> 02:28:59.090
this chasm, we're going to take a break. Because
it's been a while. We'll be back here in a little

02:28:59.164 --> 02:29:05.798
bit, guys. We do have this Wenge Dice Vault for
one of you guys to win from our friends over at

02:29:05.798 --> 02:29:10.800
Wyrmwood. This is the same wood that I use for my
dice box over here.

02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:17.650
SAM: You will win Matthew Mercer's wood tonight.
No?

02:29:17.650 --> 02:29:22.055
MATT: That works. So yeah. Head over to the twitch
chat if you want to be entered in this when called

02:29:22.055 --> 02:29:27.941
for in the the twitch chat. Tonight's code word is
titan. T-I-T-A-N. Enter that to be put into the

02:29:27.941 --> 02:29:30.495
drawing and one of you lucky winners will have
this. We'll announce you when we come back from

02:29:30.495 --> 02:29:34.101
the break. See you guys here in a few.

02:29:34.467 --> 02:29:36.810
MATT: And welcome back to Critical Role.

02:29:36.810 --> 02:29:39.484
(laughter)

02:29:39.484 --> 02:29:47.155
MATT: First off, we have a winner. The winner of
the (laughs) of the giveaway tonight is

02:29:47.155 --> 02:29:53.730
Dalen365. D-A-L-E-N. Dalen365, congratulations.
Danoba will contact you for your information and

02:29:53.730 --> 02:29:55.793
we'll get that sent out to you, so well done.

02:29:55.793 --> 02:30:00.513
LIAM: You know what? 82 people tweeted me that
Pike speaks Dwarvish. So thanks guys, thanks.

02:30:00.513 --> 02:30:02.118
LAURA: Yes, thank you for informing us.

02:30:02.118 --> 02:30:03.715
TRAVIS: (garbled) Who cares? I speak Dwarvish.

02:30:03.715 --> 02:30:08.201
MATT: I like to think that Pike could, but wanted
to let him do it. "You can do it." She taught him

02:30:08.268 --> 02:30:13.918
to write, taught him to read. She's like, "Good
job."

02:30:13.918 --> 02:30:16.559
TRAVIS: Thank you. I'm a scholar.

02:30:16.559 --> 02:30:19.248
MATT: Also, before we get started, Laura,
something you wanted to mention at the beginning,

02:30:19.248 --> 02:30:20.575
but you weren't here for the announcements.

02:30:20.575 --> 02:30:24.036
LAURA: Oh man, yeah. Uncharted: The Lost Legacy
came out this week.

02:30:24.036 --> 02:30:26.330
TRAVIS: It's so good!

02:30:26.330 --> 02:30:27.850
LAURA: You should check it out!

02:30:27.850 --> 02:30:29.558
TRAVIS: You play Nadine.

02:30:29.558 --> 02:30:31.665
LAURA: I play Nadine. You should go see it.

02:30:31.665 --> 02:30:33.393
SAM: You should go see it?

02:30:33.393 --> 02:30:35.553
MATT: At a theater near you.

02:30:35.553 --> 02:30:37.265
TALIESIN: At a drive-in near you.

02:30:37.265 --> 02:30:39.006
LAURA: Go see it, and then play it.

02:30:39.006 --> 02:30:40.443
LIAM: It's a match-three game, right?

02:30:40.443 --> 02:30:48.465
LAURA: Yeah, and also Marvel's Spider-Man show
premiered on the 19th. I'm Gwen Stacy on that.

02:30:48.465 --> 02:30:50.875
MATT: I'm the Rhino on that.

02:30:50.875 --> 02:30:54.656
MARISHA: Your shirt's so dope, too.

02:30:54.656 --> 02:30:58.175
LAURA: I saw the episode, too, and it was really
good.

02:30:58.175 --> 02:31:04.392
MATT: He's coming up throughout the series, and
he's a ridiculous character. He's fun. Fantastic.

02:31:04.392 --> 02:31:13.363
I forgot about that; thank you for the reminder.
All right, so bringing it back in. As you've left

02:31:13.363 --> 02:31:17.725
the pool and the body behind, you continue further
into this chasm.

02:31:17.725 --> 02:31:23.199
TRAVIS: Oh man, that's going to be a good Talks
later.

02:31:23.199 --> 02:31:25.724
(laughter)

02:31:25.724 --> 02:31:29.540
TRAVIS: Not that we heard anything about what you
just did.

02:31:29.540 --> 02:31:32.741
LIAM: You might have seen a corpse in the water,
floating.

02:31:32.741 --> 02:31:34.444
TRAVIS: I don't pay attention to that shit.

02:31:34.444 --> 02:31:37.131
MATT: All right.

02:31:37.131 --> 02:31:43.807
LAURA: I wanted to look in the chamber and see if
there was anything else interesting before we

02:31:43.807 --> 02:31:45.140
walked out.

02:31:45.140 --> 02:31:49.122
MATT: There are a number of dwarven buildings in
the vicinity. Some are partially or completely

02:31:49.122 --> 02:31:55.227
collapsed. Some had fallen from outcroppings and
platforms that have since fallen into the center

02:31:55.227 --> 02:31:56.556
of the chamber.

02:31:56.556 --> 02:31:59.520
TRAVIS: It's almost as if this room is meant to
introduce something.

02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:02.994
TALIESIN: Stop it!

02:32:02.994 --> 02:32:05.942
MATT: You rolled a perception. It was?

02:32:05.942 --> 02:32:07.479
LAURA: I didn't roll it.

02:32:07.479 --> 02:32:09.495
MATT: You didn't roll yet? That's right; you did.

02:32:09.495 --> 02:32:11.249
LIAM: To perceive a dead body in the water.

02:32:11.249 --> 02:32:12.925
LAURA: 29.

02:32:12.925 --> 02:32:22.865
MATT: 29. Glancing about, there's the continuation
of the path. The chasm seems to be pinching a bit

02:32:22.865 --> 02:32:29.781
the further forward you go; it's closing in. You
see six dwarven households or structures that

02:32:29.781 --> 02:32:34.597
could be entered, that look structurally enough
sound that they're standing.

02:32:34.597 --> 02:32:37.619
LAURA: Do they look rich?

02:32:37.619 --> 02:32:41.552
MATT: From this perspective? Everything looks
pretty wrecked.

02:32:41.552 --> 02:32:50.035
LAURA: Okay. We're in a hurry, right? I'm not
going to go search for stuff.

02:32:50.035 --> 02:32:57.503
MATT: All right. Continuing forward, the floor
continues to ascend upward as you reach the edge

02:32:57.503 --> 02:33:02.959
of where the earth begins to meet to that pinch at
the edge of the chasm, and there, the tunnel

02:33:02.959 --> 02:33:08.962
continues anew. There are stairs that continue for
about 25 or 30 feet beyond, as you ascend to those

02:33:08.962 --> 02:33:14.422
steps. They begin to vanish beneath more loose
earth and stone for another 20 or so feet before

02:33:14.422 --> 02:33:25.145
reemerging again in places. About 40 feet past
that, the tunnel ends at a set of heavy stone

02:33:25.145 --> 02:33:31.216
eight-foot doors. The surrounding cavern has slid
in places, but it doesn't appear to be burying the

02:33:31.216 --> 02:33:35.578
door, to a certain extent. They're just closed.
You don't see any handles; you don't see any

02:33:35.578 --> 02:33:40.945
keyhole entry point. They're just two stone slabs.
They're simple. They're smooth. There's no

02:33:40.945 --> 02:33:44.616
intricate scrolling. There's no Dwarven text.
They're just impeding your progress.

02:33:44.616 --> 02:33:46.005
LIAM: Let's have a look.

02:33:46.005 --> 02:33:47.631
LAURA: Yeah, I'll look around.

02:33:47.631 --> 02:33:48.997
MATT: Investigation check.

02:33:48.997 --> 02:33:55.706
LIAM: Oh, terrible.

02:33:55.706 --> 02:33:57.457
LAURA: 21.

02:33:57.457 --> 02:33:58.863
LIAM: 18.

02:33:58.863 --> 02:34:03.711
MATT: Okay. There does not appear to be any
locking mechanism. There doesn't appear to be any

02:34:03.711 --> 02:34:09.058
traps around it. They're just two stone slabs that
are jammed together.

02:34:09.058 --> 02:34:10.701
LAURA: No hinges, no nothing.

02:34:10.701 --> 02:34:11.730
MATT: No.

02:34:11.730 --> 02:34:13.142
TRAVIS: (clears throat)

02:34:13.142 --> 02:34:15.428
LIAM: Yes, Greg?

02:34:15.428 --> 02:34:18.886
TRAVIS: No, I just had a tickle in my throat.

02:34:18.886 --> 02:34:21.652
LAURA: Did you want to smash your way through this
very loudly?

02:34:21.652 --> 02:34:23.897
TRAVIS: Oh, did you want me to smash through this
very loudly?

02:34:23.897 --> 02:34:24.881
LAURA: No.

02:34:24.881 --> 02:34:26.849
TRAVIS: Gently, with a push, maybe?

02:34:26.849 --> 02:34:28.773
LAURA: Yeah, maybe try to push it first.

02:34:28.773 --> 02:34:38.535
TRAVIS: Fine. Can I push? Wait. Can I try pushing
on one of the slabs? The right slab.

02:34:38.535 --> 02:34:40.194
MATT: Sure. Make a strength check.

02:34:40.194 --> 02:34:41.519
LIAM: Vax is backing the fuck up.

02:34:41.519 --> 02:34:43.494
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm backing up.

02:34:43.494 --> 02:34:46.239
TRAVIS: 24.

02:34:46.239 --> 02:34:54.314
MATT: 24. You put both hands and push and push.
Your fingers (cracking) dig into the stone, and it

02:34:54.314 --> 02:34:59.373
cracks around the exterior where you push about an
inch into the stonework with your Gauntlets. As

02:34:59.373 --> 02:35:05.001
you push, you watch as the surrounding edges of
the stone door-- this is the right or the left one?

02:35:05.001 --> 02:35:06.087
TRAVIS: The right one.

02:35:06.087 --> 02:35:11.201
MATT: The right one, right. You watch as where it
meets the stone, cracks begin to form at the edge

02:35:11.201 --> 02:35:20.292
and with one shift (shifting), it seems to push
forward and (falling and impacting). You actually

02:35:20.292 --> 02:35:25.151
broke whatever mechanism was holding it in place
and caused that side of the door to fall inward

02:35:25.151 --> 02:35:29.797
(booming). As it hits the ground, you hear the
echo (echoing boom).

02:35:29.797 --> 02:35:33.581
TRAVIS: Wait, I know a saying for this: They make
them like they used to!

02:35:33.581 --> 02:35:39.655
MARISHA: That's relevant. Accurate.

02:35:39.655 --> 02:35:43.224
TRAVIS: Can I see anything immediately in the--

02:35:43.224 --> 02:35:44.698
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:35:44.698 --> 02:35:46.094
LIAM: We're all going to die.

02:35:46.094 --> 02:35:48.027
MATT: It is pitch black inside. There is no light
or light source.

02:35:48.027 --> 02:35:53.216
TRAVIS: Look at that! A modifier of zero. 18. I
have darkvision because of the belt.

02:35:53.216 --> 02:35:57.183
MATT: Yep, not bad. All right. So you glance
inside the lightless chamber. First off, the smell

02:35:57.183 --> 02:36:05.780
of rot and time, I guess you could say; that
dusty, old, ancient, untouched scent wafts from

02:36:05.780 --> 02:36:06.963
the chamber.

02:36:06.963 --> 02:36:08.728
LAURA: A really old fart.

02:36:08.728 --> 02:36:18.778
MATT: Yeah. As you glance inside, you find a
single chamber before you that splits off into two

02:36:18.778 --> 02:36:27.285
other chambers, all rectangular, and there are two
other subchambers that are beyond you. These stand

02:36:27.285 --> 02:36:31.950
about 20 feet tall at the height and about 40
feet wide on the one that's on the farthest side,

02:36:31.950 --> 02:36:36.965
and you can't make it far past to the secondary
chamber to the right. And it's asymmetrical; one

02:36:36.965 --> 02:36:40.494
seems closer than the other. There's essentially
three chambers that are all attached together,

02:36:40.494 --> 02:36:47.232
with small entryways that lead to each. The floor
is covered in flaked shale, dirt, the occasional

02:36:47.232 --> 02:36:55.341
glitter of some sort of errant coin or gold piece
or copper piece. At this point, again you hear the

02:36:55.341 --> 02:37:03.608
distant (booming) of a titan footfall. The chamber
shakes, and a fresh layer of dust falls, clouds a

02:37:03.608 --> 02:37:10.716
bit, before resting to the floor. That's the most
you can make out at first glance inside this chamber.

02:37:10.716 --> 02:37:12.392
TRAVIS: There's more tunnels.

02:37:12.392 --> 02:37:15.702
LIAM: Looking for traps, dead guys, from the
door.

02:37:15.702 --> 02:37:21.216
MARISHA: Can I do a peek and check to see if
there's signs of any cave-in potentials?

02:37:21.216 --> 02:37:26.554
Potential cave-ins?

02:37:26.554 --> 02:37:30.307
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:37:30.307 --> 02:37:34.647
LAURA: Can I feel if there's any wind coming from
one of the tunnels, like there's an opening

02:37:34.647 --> 02:37:37.084
somewhere that leads out?

02:37:37.084 --> 02:37:38.839
TRAVIS: With your face?

02:37:38.839 --> 02:37:43.842
LAURA: Yeah, I want to feel the wind on my face.
Thanks.

02:37:43.842 --> 02:37:45.047
MARISHA: 28.

02:37:45.047 --> 02:37:51.512
MATT: Glancing about this chamber, it's very well
made. In fact, based on the smatterings of gold on

02:37:51.512 --> 02:37:59.441
the ground and glancing about the way it's built,
this looks to be specifically a vault. This once

02:37:59.441 --> 02:38:06.183
contained probably a portion of the wealth of the
people of this town.

02:38:06.183 --> 02:38:08.199
LIAM: Oh, somebody rolled this place.

02:38:08.199 --> 02:38:10.422
MARISHA: We don't hear anybody or anything?

02:38:10.422 --> 02:38:11.881
MATT: Not at the moment, no.

02:38:11.881 --> 02:38:14.535
LIAM: 18 investigation check for traps and dead
guys.

02:38:14.535 --> 02:38:16.276
LAURA: 25 for wind!

02:38:16.276 --> 02:38:18.232
(laughter)

02:38:18.232 --> 02:38:23.409
MATT: There is a faint bit of airflow through the
chamber now that this door is open.

02:38:23.409 --> 02:38:25.287
LAURA: Can I tell where it's coming from?

02:38:25.287 --> 02:38:29.659
MATT: It is coming from the front of you and to
the right, the chamber you haven't been able to

02:38:29.659 --> 02:38:35.499
look past entirely, to the right. You glance about
in the entryway now that's open before you. There

02:38:35.499 --> 02:38:41.320
does not appear to be any trapped mechanism in
front of you. There are areas where some of the

02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:46.921
walls have caved in slightly. The ceiling is
solid, but there are portions where some of the

02:38:46.921 --> 02:38:51.507
wall has come in, and you can see where rockslides
have come to rest on each side and filled in some

02:38:51.507 --> 02:38:57.226
of the corners. There are piles of rags and other
wayward bits of materials that have been left

02:38:57.226 --> 02:39:05.290
behind and left to rot or sit. There's an awful,
almost citrusy rot smell coming from one of the

02:39:05.290 --> 02:39:06.824
far chambers on the left.

02:39:06.824 --> 02:39:15.589
MARISHA: I drag in the human, escort him in, and
go ahead and light up my hands.

02:39:15.589 --> 02:39:18.178
MATT: Your hands open up. Pike has?

02:39:18.178 --> 02:39:19.515
LAURA: Her mace.

02:39:19.515 --> 02:39:20.893
MATT: Her mace. Do you come in, as well?

02:39:20.893 --> 02:39:21.873
SAM: Sure, yeah!

02:39:21.873 --> 02:39:23.213
MATT: All right, so you all walk into the
chamber.

02:39:23.213 --> 02:39:25.346
LAURA: I think there's an exit ahead and to the
right.

02:39:25.346 --> 02:39:30.293
MATT: As you're glancing and doing your
investigation, looking around, to confirm that

02:39:30.293 --> 02:39:35.635
this was once a vault that held quite a bit of
wealth, you look at the base of the wall-- the

02:39:35.635 --> 02:39:40.061
parts that you can see that aren't buried-- and
you can see scrapes and grooves. Hundreds of them,

02:39:40.061 --> 02:39:48.754
like there were once many coins and other heavy
metallic materials that were placed in here that

02:39:48.754 --> 02:39:54.904
scraped against the stone as they were once on the
ground. About maybe three inches off the ground,

02:39:54.904 --> 02:39:59.803
you can see this layer of metallic scrapes across
the stonework that this place once contained a

02:39:59.803 --> 02:40:01.358
fair amount of wealth.

02:40:01.358 --> 02:40:04.742
LIAM: So if dudes came in here and put stuff in
sacks, there wouldn't be scrapes.

02:40:04.742 --> 02:40:11.327
MATT: You do notice grooves in places and signs
that this vault has already been largely raided,

02:40:11.327 --> 02:40:18.192
of course; most everything in here has been taken.
Probably a long time ago, based on the center. You

02:40:18.192 --> 02:40:26.531
do notice that one of the piles of rags begins to
twitch and shift ahead of you.

02:40:26.531 --> 02:40:29.739
LIAM: Mini Jenga.

02:40:29.739 --> 02:40:32.106
TRAVIS: Mini Jenga?

02:40:32.106 --> 02:40:33.995
LIAM: Well, there's something under that.

02:40:33.995 --> 02:40:37.550
LAURA: (whispering) Maybe you should kill it
before it says anything to you.

02:40:37.550 --> 02:40:45.746
LIAM: Do you want to? I don't think it's a small
child down here.

02:40:45.746 --> 02:40:48.837
TRAVIS: I've become Death, Destroyer of Worlds.

02:40:48.837 --> 02:40:50.517
SAM: (whispering) Dagger, dagger, dagger!

02:40:50.517 --> 02:40:52.669
LIAM: What do you want to do, Sis?

02:40:52.669 --> 02:40:54.156
LAURA: I don't know. This is all you!

02:40:54.156 --> 02:40:55.487
SAM: Kill it!

02:40:55.487 --> 02:40:56.681
TALIESIN: Detect undead?

02:40:56.681 --> 02:40:59.711
LIAM: I don't have much of that left. Yeah, my
last one, I'll use it.

02:40:59.711 --> 02:41:00.948
MARISHA: Your last one?

02:41:00.948 --> 02:41:03.601
LIAM: My last one. Detect undead, Divine Sense.

02:41:03.601 --> 02:41:12.473
MATT: Okay, Divine Sense. The rag pile, it's
around this portion of rock and fallen debris.

02:41:12.473 --> 02:41:17.522
Behind it, there's that pile of rags that's
shifting. The minute you focus, you sense that is

02:41:17.522 --> 02:41:23.175
indeed a source of undead energy, and at that
point, the rags rise up and you see a very long,

02:41:23.175 --> 02:41:29.213
greenish humanoid claw extend. As the rag falls
back, you see a familiar sight. You've encountered

02:41:29.213 --> 02:41:35.070
trolls in the wild before, but these trolls appear
to be somewhat rotting, their flesh strangely

02:41:35.070 --> 02:41:44.118
battling between decomposition and regeneration.
There's this shifting midpoint where its form and

02:41:44.118 --> 02:41:50.842
whatever cursed enchantment is held within it or
disease that claims its body is battling its nature.

02:41:50.842 --> 02:41:52.259
LIAM: How far away is it?

02:41:52.259 --> 02:41:55.516
MATT: Well, right now, it's charging, and I need
you to roll initiative.

02:41:55.516 --> 02:41:56.634
TRAVIS: Everybody?

02:41:56.634 --> 02:41:57.688
MATT: Everybody.

02:41:57.688 --> 02:41:58.907
LAURA: That fast?! Oh fuck.

02:41:58.907 --> 02:42:01.922
MATT: It slowly emerged and then (snarling)
charged in your direction.

02:42:01.922 --> 02:42:05.268
LIAM: Yay, maps!

02:42:05.268 --> 02:42:09.300
SAM: He's using all the maps we didn't use in
Indianapolis!

02:42:09.300 --> 02:42:11.313
ALL: (mockingly) Indianapolis!

02:42:11.313 --> 02:42:12.974
SAM: I am drunk!

02:42:12.974 --> 02:42:14.861
(laughter)

02:42:14.861 --> 02:42:16.972
LAURA: Indianapolis!

02:42:16.972 --> 02:42:18.431
LIAM: Look at all the gold!

02:42:18.431 --> 02:42:22.481
MATT: So that's the rag side there. Vax would've
been right there.

02:42:22.481 --> 02:42:27.351
LIAM: Look at this great tile work! I love Dwarven
Forge!

02:42:27.351 --> 02:42:31.874
MATT: (singsong) They do good shit! If you guys'd
like to place yourselves--

02:42:31.874 --> 02:42:35.189
SAM: Matt, will you leave all this stuff for me
when you go to Burning Man, so I can use it?

02:42:35.189 --> 02:42:38.997
MATT: Talk to Dani; she's watching our house. You
can borrow whatever's in there.

02:42:38.997 --> 02:42:40.346
SAM: Thanks.

02:42:40.346 --> 02:42:42.402
MATT: All right, Grog.

02:42:42.402 --> 02:42:44.208
LIAM: We are taking that bird.

02:42:44.208 --> 02:42:46.788
MARISHA: You steal my bird, you die.

02:42:46.788 --> 02:42:48.171
MATT: Vex?

02:42:48.171 --> 02:42:49.915
LAURA: Oh, I guess I'd be next to--

02:42:49.915 --> 02:42:53.729
MARISHA: You steal my bird, she will pluck your
eyes out.

02:42:53.729 --> 02:42:56.910
LAURA: Bear is with Grog.

02:42:56.910 --> 02:42:58.436
MATT: With Grog? Okay.

02:42:58.436 --> 02:43:02.273
LAURA: Trinket really likes Grog.

02:43:02.273 --> 02:43:05.948
MATT: And Scanlan? You just entered the chamber
behind everybody else.

02:43:05.948 --> 02:43:09.656
SAM: What's going on in here, guys? (screaming)

02:43:09.728 --> 02:43:15.693
LAURA: He's a big guy!

02:43:15.693 --> 02:43:20.613
MATT: Right. 25 to 20?

02:43:20.613 --> 02:43:21.931
LAURA: 24!

02:43:21.931 --> 02:43:23.095
TALIESIN: 29.

02:43:23.095 --> 02:43:26.753
LIAM: That's our Percival.

02:43:26.753 --> 02:43:31.192
MATT: Always first. All right, and then Vex. 20 to
15?

02:43:31.192 --> 02:43:32.380
LAURA: Oh, I didn't roll for Pike.

02:43:32.380 --> 02:43:33.552
TRAVIS: 16.

02:43:33.552 --> 02:43:34.661
LIAM: 15.

02:43:34.661 --> 02:43:37.488
LAURA: Ooh! 16 for Pike.

02:43:37.488 --> 02:43:40.406
MATT: Oh, all right. Pike's before Grog.

02:43:40.406 --> 02:43:43.066
LIAM, MARISHA, and TRAVIS: Pickle wreck!

02:43:43.066 --> 02:43:48.388
MARISHA: It's turned into a battle cry. Pickle
wreck!

02:43:48.388 --> 02:43:50.896
MATT: All right, 15 to ten.

02:43:50.896 --> 02:43:52.793
SAM: 11.

02:43:52.793 --> 02:44:02.213
MATT: Ten to five? Keyleth, what did you get?

02:44:02.213 --> 02:44:03.453
MARISHA: Three.

02:44:03.453 --> 02:44:04.750
(groaning)

02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:05.919
TRAVIS: What is going on?!

02:44:05.919 --> 02:44:07.317
SAM: How did you do that?

02:44:07.317 --> 02:44:09.619
MARISHA: I rolled a one, that's how. I rolled a
one.

02:44:09.619 --> 02:44:14.262
MATT: Top of the round. Percival, you watch as
something underneath this rag pile suddenly

02:44:14.262 --> 02:44:19.501
emerges and then darts around the edge. You see
it's rushing towards Vax'ildan.

02:44:19.501 --> 02:44:20.693
What are you doing?

02:44:20.693 --> 02:44:21.931
TALIESIN: I'm shooting it in the foot.

02:44:21.931 --> 02:44:22.858
MATT: Go for it.

02:44:22.858 --> 02:44:34.815
TALIESIN: So I'm actually making this a leg shot.
Burning that. That's a 22?

02:44:34.815 --> 02:44:37.415
MATT: 22? All right, 22 hits.

02:44:37.415 --> 02:44:41.839
TRAVIS: What are you shooting it with?

02:44:41.839 --> 02:44:51.388
TALIESIN: With a gun. Oh, that's nice. Yeah,
that's 17 points of damage, plus five psychic. And

02:44:51.388 --> 02:44:55.078
it has to make a strength saving throw.

02:44:55.078 --> 02:45:00.525
MATT: That is a 20. What is your--

02:45:00.525 --> 02:45:01.735
TALIESIN: 20.

02:45:01.735 --> 02:45:02.885
MATT: So it succeeds.

02:45:02.885 --> 02:45:10.985
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. That's fine. I'm going to
shoot it in the foot again, because that's what we do.

02:45:10.985 --> 02:45:13.124
MATT: That's cocked.

02:45:13.124 --> 02:45:16.366
TALIESIN: Is that cocked? Goddamn it.

02:45:16.366 --> 02:45:17.836
MARISHA: It was so close.

02:45:17.836 --> 02:45:21.090
TALIESIN: I know. That's okay. That's an 18. 24.

02:45:21.090 --> 02:45:22.231
MATT: 24 hits.

02:45:22.231 --> 02:45:23.496
MARISHA: You almost critted.

02:45:23.496 --> 02:45:31.149
TALIESIN: I know. That's ten points of damage,
plus five psychic. And again: strength saving throw.

02:45:31.149 --> 02:45:36.129
MATT: That is a 23.

02:45:36.129 --> 02:45:37.522
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

02:45:37.522 --> 02:45:40.741
MATT: Natural 16. And pretty strong.

02:45:40.741 --> 02:45:50.425
TALIESIN: That's all right. And to make life a
little more fun, let's take a head shot, because

02:45:50.425 --> 02:46:00.689
obviously he doesn't want to go down. And that's a
25. That hits. That's one more of those and one

02:46:00.689 --> 02:46:11.294
more of these. And that's 11 points of damage,
plus three psychic. 14 points of damage and a

02:46:11.294 --> 02:46:14.373
constitution saving throw.

02:46:14.373 --> 02:46:17.469
MATT: All righty. Wow, that's a 26.

02:46:17.469 --> 02:46:28.499
TALIESIN: Holy fuck! Never-goddamn-mind. And with
that, I'm going to dart in back behind Keyleth.

02:46:28.499 --> 02:46:32.830
MARISHA: Wow. That was rough, buddy. I'm sorry.

02:46:32.830 --> 02:46:37.994
TALIESIN: Is that as far back as I can get? Yeah.
And I'll use my bonus to reload.

02:46:37.994 --> 02:46:39.946
MATT: All righty. That ends Percival's turn. Vex,
you're up.

02:46:39.946 --> 02:46:41.132
LAURA: Hunter's Mark!

02:46:41.132 --> 02:46:42.424
MATT: All right. Who are you marking? That guy?

02:46:42.424 --> 02:46:43.603
LAURA: That troll that I see.

02:46:43.603 --> 02:46:44.998
MATT: That's right. There is the one troll.

02:46:44.998 --> 02:46:47.089
LAURA: I'm going to Hunter's Mark Grog.

02:46:47.089 --> 02:46:48.526
MATT: Yeah. And there you go.

02:46:48.526 --> 02:46:50.829
LAURA: Okay. And I'm going to shoot him.

02:46:50.829 --> 02:46:51.926
MATT: Go for it.

02:46:51.926 --> 02:46:53.959
LAURA: With a natural one.

02:46:53.959 --> 02:46:59.870
MATT: With a natural one! So as you mark him, you
pull out the first arrow and you yank backward,

02:46:59.870 --> 02:47:06.294
and as the arrow string tenses, the actual shaft
seems to snap in place. The arrow had somehow

02:47:06.294 --> 02:47:10.693
dry-rotted through your travels. Chuck it at the
ground and pull another.

02:47:10.693 --> 02:47:18.467
LAURA: Okay, this one is going to be sharpshooter
with Blazing Bowstring, so hopefully-- goddamn it!

02:47:18.467 --> 02:47:19.720
What the fuck?

02:47:19.720 --> 02:47:21.033
LIAM: Oh! Two!

02:47:21.033 --> 02:47:22.035
TRAVIS: That's a two.

02:47:22.035 --> 02:47:23.846
MATT: All right. So what's the total bonus on that
one?

02:47:23.846 --> 02:47:25.207
MARISHA: What is happening to us?

02:47:25.207 --> 02:47:27.984
LAURA: Oh my god, that's 11 to hit.

02:47:27.984 --> 02:47:29.659
MATT: Yeah, that missed. Sorry.

02:47:29.659 --> 02:47:31.643
LAURA: Jesus H. Macy!

02:47:31.643 --> 02:47:35.089
MATT: So the first arrow shatters in place, then
pull out the second one and go to fire, and as you

02:47:35.089 --> 02:47:38.995
strike, the arrow seems like it should hit it, but
instead it hits one of the rags over its shoulder

02:47:38.995 --> 02:47:43.145
that makes it look like its mass is larger than it
is, and it passes through harmlessly, causing the

02:47:43.145 --> 02:47:49.892
rag to flutter off, revealing its shoulder. You
can see the bits of greenish muscle and sinew

02:47:49.892 --> 02:47:56.950
showing up beneath one of the gashes of its rotted
shoulder. You're going to move or Trinket can move?

02:47:56.950 --> 02:48:00.574
LAURA: Can I climb up those rocks behind me and
stand on the top of them?

02:48:00.574 --> 02:48:05.010
MATT: Sure. On top of the rocks there, getting
ready to fire.

02:48:05.010 --> 02:48:15.483
LAURA: And then Trinket is going to run over and
stand next to Pike. He's going to try to protect us.

02:48:15.483 --> 02:48:18.245
MATT: There you go. All righty.

02:48:18.245 --> 02:48:22.376
LAURA: Can he move far enough to be on the other
side of her?

02:48:22.376 --> 02:48:25.591
MATT: Nope. What's his movement? Is it 30 or 40?

02:48:25.591 --> 02:48:26.709
LAURA: 40.

02:48:26.709 --> 02:48:28.225
MATT: 40? He could, actually.

02:48:28.225 --> 02:48:29.904
LAURA: Yeah, he goes to the other side.

02:48:29.904 --> 02:48:36.544
MATT: He can move over there. Perfect. All right.
Ending your turn. Pike's up next.

02:48:36.544 --> 02:48:45.077
LIAM: (impact) Kind of a gooch-smashing day, so
she's going to walk right up to him and slam it

02:48:45.077 --> 02:48:47.238
right into his junk, yeah?

02:48:47.238 --> 02:48:49.392
LAURA: Really, that's what she's going to do?

02:48:49.392 --> 02:48:50.593
LIAM: That is what she's going to do.

02:48:50.593 --> 02:48:52.717
LAURA: I guess it's undead. She can't try to turn
undead?

02:48:52.717 --> 02:48:56.978
LIAM: Well, if she wants to use one of three
channel divinities for today.

02:48:56.978 --> 02:48:58.781
LAURA: Fine.

02:48:58.781 --> 02:49:00.716
LIAM: She's hitting him in the gooch.

02:49:00.716 --> 02:49:04.568
LAURA: 23!

02:49:04.568 --> 02:49:05.435
LIAM: 23 to hit.

02:49:05.435 --> 02:49:06.353
MATT: That hits!

02:49:06.353 --> 02:49:07.227
LIAM: All right.

02:49:07.227 --> 02:49:08.334
LAURA: Great. Good.

02:49:08.334 --> 02:49:18.849
LIAM: Plus the what's it called? Divine Strike, so
three plus four is seven, plus the 2d8. That ain't

02:49:18.849 --> 02:49:25.849
a d8. That's 13. 21. To the gooch.

02:49:25.849 --> 02:49:30.682
MATT: Nice. (impact) She runs up and slams it with
the side of the mace. As it hits, you can see

02:49:30.682 --> 02:49:32.784
there's a flash of radiant energy and it burns
away some of the--

02:49:32.784 --> 02:49:35.421
LAURA: It takes an additional 2d6 radiant because
he's undead.

02:49:35.421 --> 02:49:44.713
LIAM: Yes! That's right. Fiend or undead take
extra 2d6 radiant damage.

02:49:44.713 --> 02:49:46.859
LAURA: With her Mace of Disruption.

02:49:46.859 --> 02:49:48.766
MATT: Correct. What's the additional damage?

02:49:48.766 --> 02:49:51.555
LIAM: Whatever I just told you.

02:49:51.555 --> 02:49:52.689
SAM: 21.

02:49:52.689 --> 02:49:53.928
LIAM: And now I'm going to roll for that extra--

02:49:53.928 --> 02:49:55.055
LAURA: I just did; it's seven.

02:49:55.055 --> 02:49:57.032
MATT: What was the first damage roll you did to do
21 points of damage to her?

02:49:57.032 --> 02:49:59.073
LIAM: That was the Mace of Disruption.

02:49:59.073 --> 02:50:01.201
LAURA: 2d6 plus four radiant damage.

02:50:01.201 --> 02:50:06.483
LIAM: Plus Divine Strike. Once on each turn, add
2d8 of weapon damage to your damage total.

02:50:06.483 --> 02:50:10.671
LAURA: So that's what all he rolled, and then
since it's undead, it's an additional 2d6.

02:50:10.671 --> 02:50:18.348
MATT: Yeah, 2d8. Yeah. Fuck yeah! All righty.

02:50:18.348 --> 02:50:20.862
LAURA: An additional seven because he's undead.

02:50:20.862 --> 02:50:22.959
TRAVIS: So 28 total.

02:50:22.959 --> 02:50:24.671
LIAM: (gun cocking) Gooch shot.

02:50:24.671 --> 02:50:32.687
MATT: That is actually pretty damn nasty. Worth
doing cleric.

02:50:32.687 --> 02:50:34.649
LIAM: She needs to jump up to hit it.

02:50:34.649 --> 02:50:35.924
TRAVIS: She's at 18, right?

02:50:35.924 --> 02:50:39.237
LIAM: What's at 18?

02:50:39.237 --> 02:50:40.219
TRAVIS: Pike.

02:50:40.219 --> 02:50:44.128
LIAM: We're not sure. 17 or 18. Real life is
hazy.

02:50:44.128 --> 02:50:49.008
MATT: She can use a bonus action to hit again if
she wants. That's one of her war domain abilities.

02:50:49.008 --> 02:50:50.213
LAURA: Whoa, fuck yeah!

02:50:50.213 --> 02:50:51.669
LIAM: Double gooch shot!

02:50:51.669 --> 02:50:52.954
LAURA: One for each.

02:50:52.954 --> 02:50:57.305
LIAM: Keep looking at mine. Same thing.
23.

02:50:57.305 --> 02:50:59.353
MATT: All right, 23 hits. Roll damage again.

02:50:59.353 --> 02:51:14.862
LIAM: (counting) 12 and then the radiant damage.
2d6. So we're at 12 plus five plus-- no, once per

02:51:14.862 --> 02:51:16.260
turn. 17.

02:51:16.260 --> 02:51:23.833
MATT: 17 damage? All righty. So a second hit
slams, and you could see the first one where it

02:51:23.833 --> 02:51:29.737
burst out, burned and singed the necrotic flash.
The second one hits, not as impactful but still,

02:51:29.737 --> 02:51:32.123
it looks relatively hurt. That ends Pike's go.

02:51:32.123 --> 02:51:36.214
LAURA: Can't she move away from him? Oh, no,
because he will get an attack.

02:51:36.214 --> 02:51:39.585
MATT: She could move back five, but it will get an
attack of opportunity if she does that.

02:51:39.585 --> 02:51:41.014
LIAM: No, she's going to face him down.

02:51:41.014 --> 02:51:42.312
MATT: Okay. Grog, you're up.

02:51:42.312 --> 02:51:51.069
TRAVIS: I would like to rage and run up and to
this doorway. Five, 10, 15, 20. Can I see anything

02:51:51.069 --> 02:51:52.455
in this room?

02:51:52.455 --> 02:51:53.636
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:51:53.636 --> 02:51:56.364
TRAVIS: Okay. Five.

02:51:56.364 --> 02:51:57.478
MATT: Nope.

02:51:57.478 --> 02:52:04.767
TRAVIS: Yep. I don't see anything. Oh, do I feel
anything from the black metallic hammer that I'm

02:52:04.767 --> 02:52:06.032
holding?

02:52:06.032 --> 02:52:07.874
LAURA: Oh yeah, you've been trying to attune to
it.

02:52:07.874 --> 02:52:10.617
MATT: I don't think you've had time yet to fully
attune to it.

02:52:10.617 --> 02:52:12.918
TALIESIN: He started attuning to it before the
break.

02:52:12.918 --> 02:52:15.308
(laughter)

02:52:15.308 --> 02:52:16.889
LIAM: It's a half hour ago, at this point.

02:52:16.889 --> 02:52:19.021
SAM: The break doesn't exist.

02:52:19.021 --> 02:52:20.510
TRAVIS: It's not really enough time. Okay.

02:52:20.510 --> 02:52:22.734
LAURA: He started attuning to it as soon as Percy
felt something from the belt, so if it's

02:52:22.734 --> 02:52:24.318
been long enough?

02:52:24.318 --> 02:52:25.858
LIAM: You can say no.

02:52:25.858 --> 02:52:27.282
TRAVIS: I'm going to keep coming in here.

02:52:27.282 --> 02:52:28.126
MATT: Sure.

02:52:28.126 --> 02:52:29.264
TRAVIS: Really?

02:52:29.264 --> 02:52:31.031
MATT: If you want to, I'll let you attune to it.

02:52:31.031 --> 02:52:35.998
TRAVIS: Yeah? I'll attune to it. I want to attune
to it first.

02:52:35.998 --> 02:52:37.469
LIAM: You go blind.

02:52:37.469 --> 02:52:38.639
SAM: Insta-death.

02:52:38.639 --> 02:52:40.166
MATT: Okay. Go ahead.

02:52:40.166 --> 02:52:41.809
LAURA: Are you going to attack the guy with it?

02:52:41.809 --> 02:52:43.324
TRAVIS: Well, I don't see anything in the room,
right?

02:52:43.324 --> 02:52:44.798
MATT: You don't see anything in the room.

02:52:44.798 --> 02:52:45.958
TRAVIS: Can I make my way through here?

02:52:45.958 --> 02:52:46.816
MATT: You may.

02:52:46.816 --> 02:52:47.710
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:52:47.710 --> 02:52:49.593
LIAM: (whispering) Grog, I'm so glad we're
together at last.

02:52:49.593 --> 02:52:51.528
MARISHA: Starts talking to him &lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt;.

02:52:51.528 --> 02:52:56.109
TALIESIN: What if it heals him? He hits him so
hard it actually puts health points back into him.

02:52:56.109 --> 02:52:58.492
MARISHA: It's Craven Edge. He just got a
make-over.

02:52:58.492 --> 02:52:59.994
TRAVIS: Can I make a reckless attack against him?

02:52:59.994 --> 02:53:00.986
MATT: You may.

02:53:00.986 --> 02:53:02.053
TALIESIN: Craven Head.

02:53:02.053 --> 02:53:06.137
TRAVIS: Craven Head. That's not great. 22.

02:53:06.137 --> 02:53:07.448
MATT: What was the natural roll?

02:53:07.448 --> 02:53:08.767
TRAVIS: A six.

02:53:08.767 --> 02:53:13.716
MATT: A six? As you swing the hammer, go ahead and
roll damage.

02:53:13.716 --> 02:53:20.520
LAURA: Oh no. This is something weird.

02:53:20.520 --> 02:53:23.957
TRAVIS: 23.

02:53:23.957 --> 02:53:30.021
MATT: You suffer 23 points of bludgeoning damage
as you swing and clobber yourself across the face

02:53:30.021 --> 02:53:31.304
with the hammer.

02:53:31.304 --> 02:53:32.914
SAM and TALIESIN: What?

02:53:32.914 --> 02:53:35.098
TRAVIS: I'm drunk. (laughs)

02:53:35.098 --> 02:53:37.829
LAURA: Is it like if you roll below a certain
thing you hit yourself instead?

02:53:37.829 --> 02:53:42.469
TRAVIS: 23, so half of that is 12. 11.

02:53:42.469 --> 02:53:46.659
MATT: So you pull back and (whack). You're taken
aback by it.

02:53:46.659 --> 02:53:49.195
TALIESIN: I'm so amused.

02:53:49.195 --> 02:53:55.345
TRAVIS: I try again.

02:53:55.345 --> 02:53:56.901
MATT: Roll for an attack.

02:53:56.901 --> 02:53:58.403
LAURA: Oh my god, roll high!

02:53:58.403 --> 02:53:59.968
TRAVIS: Reckless, great weapon master.

02:53:59.968 --> 02:54:02.337
MARISHA: Why do you always get the fucked-up
weapon?

02:54:02.337 --> 02:54:03.887
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

02:54:03.887 --> 02:54:05.282
MATT: Okay.

02:54:05.282 --> 02:54:06.965
MARISHA: This is going to knock him out.

02:54:06.965 --> 02:54:08.372
MATT: Roll damage.

02:54:08.372 --> 02:54:11.579
LIAM: Finally, an enemy that can kill Grog.

02:54:11.579 --> 02:54:14.361
TRAVIS: I've been doing a d12. Is that appropriate
for the hammer?

02:54:14.361 --> 02:54:16.358
MATT: No, did you do a d12 last time?

02:54:16.358 --> 02:54:18.339
TRAVIS: Yeah. So I'd to do a d10?

02:54:18.339 --> 02:54:19.878
MATT: For the warhammer.

02:54:19.878 --> 02:54:21.004
TRAVIS: Two-handed.

02:54:21.004 --> 02:54:26.064
MATT: Warhammer is 1d8, but if you're a versatile
two-handed, it's a d10.

02:54:26.064 --> 02:54:27.244
TRAVIS: Let's do that.

02:54:27.244 --> 02:54:33.989
MATT: So. It's fine for the last one. Since you
took it to the face.

02:54:33.989 --> 02:54:36.143
TALIESIN: That'd be amazing!

02:54:36.143 --> 02:54:39.627
LIAM: No, it wouldn't.

02:54:39.627 --> 02:54:45.153
TRAVIS: 22, 32. 38.

02:54:45.153 --> 02:54:47.399
(laughter)

02:54:47.399 --> 02:54:48.504
TRAVIS: 39.

02:54:48.504 --> 02:54:49.512
MATT: 39?

02:54:49.512 --> 02:54:50.673
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:54:50.673 --> 02:54:51.851
SAM: That's with the double?

02:54:51.851 --> 02:54:53.978
LAURA: Wait, you forgot to add stuff?

02:54:53.978 --> 02:54:55.174
TRAVIS: Yeah, hold on.

02:54:55.174 --> 02:54:56.060
SAM: It's a crit, right?

02:54:56.060 --> 02:54:57.205
LIAM: Double the dice.

02:54:57.205 --> 02:54:59.570
TRAVIS: 46.

02:54:59.570 --> 02:55:06.105
MATT: 46, okay. So you reach back with the hammer
after shaking your head, and with a giant, angry

02:55:06.105 --> 02:55:12.567
yell, (yelling) the hammer comes down and cracks
into the face of the troll, causing its head to

02:55:12.567 --> 02:55:19.669
push into its ribcage, and it falls to the
ground.

02:55:19.669 --> 02:55:21.956
LAURA: He's going to get back up.

02:55:21.956 --> 02:55:29.583
MATT: No, it does not make its saving throw. It
falls to the ground, unmoving. Crushed.

02:55:29.583 --> 02:55:32.815
TRAVIS: That was better. Ow.

02:55:32.815 --> 02:55:34.043
MATT: All right, is that your turn, Grog?

02:55:34.043 --> 02:55:35.350
TRAVIS: That is.

02:55:35.350 --> 02:55:36.518
MATT: Vax, you're up.

02:55:36.518 --> 02:55:37.484
LIAM: So next I'm up?

02:55:37.484 --> 02:55:38.512
MATT: Yeah.

02:55:38.512 --> 02:55:40.029
TALIESIN: Oh, that other room.

02:55:40.029 --> 02:55:42.149
LAURA: Is there other shit in there?

02:55:42.149 --> 02:55:43.419
TALIESIN: We don't know what's in there.

02:55:43.419 --> 02:56:00.434
LIAM: Right. I'm going to move past Pike, past the
troll, and hold my action should anything come

02:56:00.434 --> 02:56:01.851
from that room.

02:56:01.851 --> 02:56:03.296
MATT: Okay, what are you holding?

02:56:03.296 --> 02:56:07.362
LIAM: If I see a creature running at any of us,
I'm going to throw.

02:56:07.362 --> 02:56:13.227
MATT: Okay, good to know. That ends your turn,
holding your action. Rushing around the corner

02:56:13.227 --> 02:56:26.961
immediately, you hear this (growling) as these
black-drooling undead trolls, their eyes like a

02:56:26.961 --> 02:56:36.670
jet-black bead, hints of light hitting the shine
of it, like shark eyes. This one rushes past.

02:56:36.670 --> 02:56:38.949
LAURA: He goes for Keyleth?

02:56:38.949 --> 02:56:44.902
MATT: Right up to there. And then this one, here.
Go ahead.

02:56:44.902 --> 02:56:46.726
LIAM: Yeah. (dagger noises) Okay.

02:56:46.726 --> 02:56:49.119
TALIESIN: Fuck shit up.

02:56:49.119 --> 02:56:55.941
LIAM: I'm going before them in the order. Does
that mean I get advantage, due to assassin?

02:56:55.941 --> 02:57:01.197
MATT: No, because this is their turn. You're
reacting to their action.

02:57:01.197 --> 02:57:03.169
LIAM: Cool,. 25 for the first.

02:57:03.169 --> 02:57:04.056
MATT: Hits.

02:57:04.056 --> 02:57:06.007
LIAM: Okay. Second is a 25.

02:57:06.007 --> 02:57:07.061
MATT: Hits.

02:57:07.061 --> 02:57:08.712
LIAM: Third is a 15.

02:57:08.712 --> 02:57:10.667
MATT: You don't get a bonus action, because this
is only an action you held.

02:57:10.667 --> 02:57:11.910
LIAM: Oh, okay. Cool.

02:57:11.910 --> 02:57:15.208
MATT: Which I probably forgot that earlier; it's
fine.

02:57:15.208 --> 02:57:18.002
LIAM: Right, so what did I say for the first two?

02:57:18.002 --> 02:57:19.667
MATT: They both hit.

02:57:19.667 --> 02:57:27.970
LIAM: Okay, cool. But no sneak attack at all, so
here they come. First one is 11, plus psychic

02:57:27.970 --> 02:57:36.545
damage is 17 for the first, and the second one is
15 for the second. 17 and 15.

02:57:36.545 --> 02:57:38.209
MATT: 17 and 15?

02:57:38.209 --> 02:57:40.418
LAURA: Those are good attacks without sneak
attack.

02:57:40.418 --> 02:57:47.919
MATT: So as it turns around the corner (snarling)
and it goes into a sprint towards you, rushing

02:57:47.919 --> 02:57:53.516
forward, it's going to go ahead and attack you
twice with its claws and one with its bite. The

02:57:53.516 --> 02:57:56.042
claw attack is 20.

02:57:56.042 --> 02:57:56.963
LIAM: No.

02:57:56.963 --> 02:58:04.649
MATT: You dodge out of the first claw. It strikes
upward with its other hand. That is a 22.

02:58:04.649 --> 02:58:07.623
LIAM: That does hit. I'll use Uncanny Dodge on
it.

02:58:07.623 --> 02:58:17.591
MATT: Okay. 17 points of slashing damage reduced
to eight. Eight points slashing damage, and its

02:58:17.591 --> 02:58:20.032
bite attack. That's a natural 20.

02:58:20.032 --> 02:58:21.924
LIAM: That hits.

02:58:21.924 --> 02:58:29.200
MATT: However, it only rolled a one on the damage.
You take six points of piercing damage, and I need

02:58:29.200 --> 02:58:30.904
you to make a constitution saving throw.

02:58:30.904 --> 02:58:35.993
LIAM: Balls. Okay. (singing) Don't fail me, Raven
Queen, like you've done so many times before.

02:58:35.993 --> 02:58:38.217
(speaking) That is a 17.

02:58:38.217 --> 02:58:41.414
MATT: Did you drop it, or did you roll it
intentionally?

02:58:41.414 --> 02:58:45.083
LIAM: What do you mean? I'll roll it again, if you
want. I don't care. I'm rolling it again! That's

02:58:45.083 --> 02:58:47.865
way worse: nine.

02:58:47.865 --> 02:58:49.474
TRAVIS: It looked like he dropped it.

02:58:49.474 --> 02:58:54.419
MATT: It looked like you dropped it. Okay. Good to
know. All right. So then the other one that's

02:58:54.419 --> 02:58:59.730
rushing up to you, Keyleth, is going to attack
you, as well. That is a 17 to hit?

02:58:59.730 --> 02:59:01.293
MARISHA: Yeah, that hits.

02:59:01.293 --> 02:59:05.519
SAM: I'm going to use Cutting Words to take that
down.

02:59:05.519 --> 02:59:06.928
MARISHA: Oh, thanks, man.

02:59:06.928 --> 02:59:16.455
SAM: That's all right. I will yell at the troll:
Oi, troll, I would kick your ass, but I don't want

02:59:16.455 --> 02:59:18.486
troll shit on my foot.

02:59:18.486 --> 02:59:20.213
(laughter)

02:59:20.213 --> 02:59:22.802
MATT: Go ahead and roll your d12.

02:59:22.802 --> 02:59:24.773
TRAVIS: We know, baby.

02:59:24.773 --> 02:59:26.107
LIAM: You've just peaked, Sam.

02:59:26.107 --> 02:59:28.203
SAM: Eight.

02:59:28.203 --> 02:59:32.542
MATT: Yeah. So with that enough of a distraction,
his head turns to you over her shoulder, and the

02:59:32.542 --> 02:59:34.920
swing goes wide. Second claw strike.

02:59:34.920 --> 02:59:41.591
MARISHA: Only because I turn around at Scanlan and
go: (laughs) That's good. Aw, yeah.

02:59:41.591 --> 02:59:44.138
MATT: Which is just enough for it to roll a 19 on
its second attack with the claw.

02:59:44.138 --> 02:59:46.330
MARISHA: And I go: Ugh! Yeah.

02:59:46.330 --> 02:59:52.390
MATT: Which deals 14 points of slashing damage,
and it's going to go in for a bite after the claw

02:59:52.390 --> 02:59:56.136
strikes at you and grabs your shoulder and it
pulls you in. Its troll mouth almost seems to

02:59:56.136 --> 03:00:02.332
hyperextend as it snaps down towards your
shoulder. That is a 22.

03:00:02.332 --> 03:00:04.349
MARISHA: Not the mantle! Yeah, that hits.

03:00:04.349 --> 03:00:08.738
MATT: All right. You take eight points of piercing
damage, and make a constitution saving throw.

03:00:08.738 --> 03:00:11.083
SAM: Constitution saving throw.

03:00:11.083 --> 03:00:12.549
LIAM: Let me take my antlers off.

03:00:12.549 --> 03:00:18.031
MARISHA: Hold my antlers! Yeah, that's good. 19.

03:00:18.031 --> 03:00:18.976
MATT: Okay.

03:00:18.976 --> 03:00:20.197
TRAVIS: Hold my antlers, girl.

03:00:20.197 --> 03:00:22.327
MARISHA: Okay?

03:00:22.327 --> 03:00:29.981
MATT: That brings us to the one. So the one on the
ground that had been slaughtered by Pike, its

03:00:29.981 --> 03:00:35.356
wounds seem to heal up slightly, and as it gets up
from the ground, it's going to strike out towards

03:00:35.356 --> 03:00:44.071
Pike. Getting up from prone. So the first strike
is-- that's cocked. That is 24 to hit.

03:00:44.071 --> 03:00:45.278
LIAM: Yes.

03:00:45.278 --> 03:00:48.845
MATT: All right. She takes eight points of
slashing damage.

03:00:48.845 --> 03:00:50.012
LIAM: Okay.

03:00:50.012 --> 03:00:53.290
MATT: Second attack is (counting) 25.

03:00:53.290 --> 03:00:56.006
LAURA: No, 25 to hit.

03:00:56.006 --> 03:00:57.332
LIAM: That hits, yeah.

03:00:57.332 --> 03:01:01.229
MATT: Ten points of slashing damage, and as it
grabs both sides of her armor, it's going to

03:01:01.229 --> 03:01:05.229
actually lift her off the ground and pull her
towards its mouth. Its jaw (snarling) opens up to

03:01:05.229 --> 03:01:09.693
almost alligator-chomp down on her. The sides of
its mouth almost curve back towards its neck.

03:01:09.693 --> 03:01:11.133
LIAM: That's fucked up, Matt.

03:01:11.133 --> 03:01:17.687
MATT: That is going to be a seven plus nine, a 16,
which I don't believe-- she brings her shield up

03:01:17.687 --> 03:01:22.130
just in place, and as the top jaw comes down on
the edge of her shoulder armor, the shield takes

03:01:22.130 --> 03:01:26.686
the bottom jaw, and she just manages to wrestle it
off of her and land on her feet, unscathed by the

03:01:26.686 --> 03:01:30.854
bite. That's going to end their turn. Scanlan,
you're up.

03:01:30.854 --> 03:01:37.649
SAM: Me? Oh god. I'm not wasting my shit on them.

03:01:37.649 --> 03:01:41.638
LAURA: I know. That's the problem. None of us want
to do anything.

03:01:41.638 --> 03:01:45.124
LIAM: Yeah. We're just going to slog. Slog it out,
man, slog it out.

03:01:45.124 --> 03:01:48.530
(laughter)

03:01:48.530 --> 03:01:51.407
MATT: So you're moving up to this guy?

03:01:51.407 --> 03:01:52.577
SAM: Yeah.

03:01:52.577 --> 03:01:55.497
MATT: All righty. There you go.

03:01:55.497 --> 03:01:56.967
TRAVIS: Come on, 20!

03:01:56.967 --> 03:02:09.322
SAM: 16. That's a 26 to hit. Yeah, 1d8! Three!
Plus four, that's seven. Oh, but wait, there's

03:02:09.322 --> 03:02:14.503
more! Plus four. 11 points of damage.

03:02:14.503 --> 03:02:19.389
MATT: 11 points of damage. As you rush up and slip
it right into the sternum of the troll creature,

03:02:19.389 --> 03:02:25.930
it goes through and points out the other side. It
goes (snarl). You pull it out.

03:02:25.930 --> 03:02:34.379
SAM: Like a matador, I turn my back to him,
because I don't think he can hit me. I don't think

03:02:34.379 --> 03:02:35.964
he's got it in him.

03:02:35.964 --> 03:02:38.746
MATT: Perfect! Percival, you're up.

03:02:38.746 --> 03:02:45.564
TALIESIN: That one that just got up is irritating
me, so I'm going to start by shooting him in the face.

03:02:45.564 --> 03:02:46.733
LIAM: Yes, please.

03:02:46.733 --> 03:02:52.642
TALIESIN: That's irritating. So that's a 32 to
hit.

03:02:52.642 --> 03:02:54.533
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

03:02:54.533 --> 03:03:00.347
TALIESIN: That's 12 points of damage plus five
psychic, so 17 points of damage.

03:03:00.347 --> 03:03:08.101
MATT: 17 points of damage. All right. So as you
hit it, (gunshot) you blow a large chunk out of

03:03:08.101 --> 03:03:13.574
its side, a wound that should have knocked it
down, and it still stands and looks towards you

03:03:13.574 --> 03:03:15.500
(growling).

03:03:15.500 --> 03:03:28.826
TALIESIN: That's irritating. All right. Hitting it
again. That's 26 to hit. And that's, ugh! Nine

03:03:28.826 --> 03:03:31.478
points of damage and one psychic. That's ten
points of damage.

03:03:31.478 --> 03:03:37.863
MATT: All right. Ten points of damage. (chuckles)
Once again, another shot (gunshot) blows out part

03:03:37.863 --> 03:03:41.045
of its ribcage, and you see organs (slurping) slop
out onto the ground, and it--

03:03:41.045 --> 03:03:45.975
TALIESIN: For fuck's sake. Are we missing
something here?

03:03:45.975 --> 03:03:50.254
LAURA: They're regenerating. Something's holding
them together.

03:03:50.254 --> 03:03:54.637
LIAM: Well, it could be their version of Death
Ward.

03:03:54.637 --> 03:03:56.691
TALIESIN: Yeah, fine, all right. I'm taking a
third shot on that one.

03:03:56.691 --> 03:03:59.087
MARISHA: Is it we're going to have to do radiant
damage?

03:03:59.087 --> 03:04:00.670
MATT: You've fought trolls before.

03:04:00.670 --> 03:04:03.898
SAM: I don't remember them. When were they?

03:04:03.898 --> 03:04:07.711
MARISHA: That was a long time ago.

03:04:07.711 --> 03:04:10.033
TRAVIS: Doesn't fire work on trolls?

03:04:10.033 --> 03:04:12.715
LIAM: Fire does work on trolls, yes.

03:04:12.715 --> 03:04:17.653
LAURA: That's why I was hoping my bowstrings would
work, but I missed my shot.

03:04:17.653 --> 03:04:20.055
TRAVIS: Well, that was dumb.

03:04:20.055 --> 03:04:24.668
TALIESIN: Well, irritated by that one, I'm going
to turn my attention to the one that's bothering

03:04:24.668 --> 03:04:32.721
Keyleth and Scanlan, and I'm going to take a
headshot at it. Burning grit, because fuck it, it

03:04:32.721 --> 03:04:38.437
regenerates. Let's take a headshot. And that's 32
to hit.

03:04:38.437 --> 03:04:39.950
MATT: That'll hit.

03:04:39.950 --> 03:04:45.552
TALIESIN: And that's 16 points of damage plus
three psychic, so that's 19 points of damage. And

03:04:45.552 --> 03:04:49.754
he has to do a constitution saving throw.

03:04:49.754 --> 03:04:51.393
MATT: 26.

03:04:51.393 --> 03:04:52.765
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it. Stop it.

03:04:52.765 --> 03:04:55.375
MATT: I'm sorry. I'm rolling really well for their
saving throws.

03:04:55.375 --> 03:05:02.927
TALIESIN: That's really irritating. I wasted so
much grit, and nothing's happened. All right, I'm

03:05:02.927 --> 03:05:05.935
going to back up even further out of the room. I'm
going to back up to the very edge.

03:05:05.935 --> 03:05:12.196
MATT: All right. So we'll say you back up over
there. You're now backing down into the tunnel

03:05:12.196 --> 03:05:14.483
where you guys had risen up before you got to the
door.

03:05:14.483 --> 03:05:18.823
LIAM and LAURA: T-pose, please.

03:05:18.823 --> 03:05:23.325
MATT: All right, that ends Percival's turn. Vex,
you're up.

03:05:23.325 --> 03:05:24.987
TALIESIN: We need some fire.

03:05:24.987 --> 03:05:30.494
LAURA: Yeah, I don't have any of that. Well, but
my Blazing Bowstring. I'm going to try it.

03:05:30.494 --> 03:05:33.049
TRAVIS: Maybe something else, like poison or acid?
Isn't it acid?

03:05:33.049 --> 03:05:38.605
LAURA: I'm going to shoot the one that I tried to
hit before.

03:05:38.605 --> 03:05:40.406
MATT: Okay. Want to leave Hunter's Mark on it,
still?

03:05:40.406 --> 03:05:44.993
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to do it. I'm going to try
sharpshooter again.

03:05:44.993 --> 03:05:46.306
MATT: Okay.

03:05:46.306 --> 03:05:52.296
LAURA: Goddamn it. That doesn't hit. (sighs) Okay,
I'm going to try it again.

03:05:52.296 --> 03:05:53.466
MATT: So was it a three?

03:05:53.466 --> 03:05:54.633
LAURA: Yeah.

03:05:54.633 --> 03:05:55.919
MATT: Plus?

03:05:55.919 --> 03:05:57.520
LAURA: Plus 14, minus five.

03:05:57.520 --> 03:05:58.640
MATT: Yeah, no.

03:05:58.640 --> 03:06:02.867
LAURA: That one hits! That definitely hits.

03:06:02.867 --> 03:06:04.267
LIAM: It's on foam, but it's good.

03:06:04.267 --> 03:06:07.969
LAURA: That is, yeah. So that hits, right?

03:06:07.969 --> 03:06:09.048
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

03:06:09.048 --> 03:06:21.924
LAURA: Okay. I didn't say Blazing Bowstring, so it
doesn't count. 14 plus one lightning damage. Yeah,

03:06:21.924 --> 03:06:23.574
sneak attack.

03:06:23.574 --> 03:06:25.563
MARISHA: Hey, Grog.

03:06:25.563 --> 03:06:26.292
TRAVIS: What?

03:06:26.292 --> 03:06:27.531
MARISHA: You're good on health, yeah?

03:06:27.531 --> 03:06:28.751
TRAVIS: (scoffs) Yeah.

03:06:28.751 --> 03:06:36.350
LAURA: Plus six is 14 for the sneak attack. and
then five for Hunter's Mark.

03:06:36.350 --> 03:06:38.539
MATT: Okay. And Blazing Bowstring?

03:06:38.539 --> 03:06:40.714
LAURA: I didn't say Blazing Bowstring.

03:06:40.714 --> 03:06:46.954
MATT: Oh, yeah. Okay. So the arrow (impact) hits
it in the chest area. You watch as part of its

03:06:46.954 --> 03:06:52.332
ribcage caves in from the blow, and it actually
exits out the back. None of the flesh seems to stop

03:06:52.332 --> 03:06:56.604
it, and it (choking) falls to the ground,
unmoving.

03:06:56.604 --> 03:07:03.358
LAURA: For my bonus-- oh wait, that's a 4th-level
spell. Should I use it or not?

03:07:03.358 --> 03:07:04.537
MARISHA: Save it.

03:07:04.537 --> 03:07:09.144
LAURA: All right, I'll save it. I'm going to
transfer the Hunter's Mark to the one

03:07:09.144 --> 03:07:10.723
attacking my brother.

03:07:10.723 --> 03:07:12.637
MATT: As your bonus action? All right.

03:07:12.637 --> 03:07:25.457
LAURA: And then Trinket is going to run up and
stand next to my brother so you can get flank attack.

03:07:25.457 --> 03:07:27.025
LIAM: Love you.

03:07:27.025 --> 03:07:29.837
MATT: There you go. Perfect. That ends Vex's turn.
Pike's up.

03:07:29.837 --> 03:07:33.462
LIAM: Oh jeez. Okay. So I think--

03:07:33.462 --> 03:07:35.278
TRAVIS: (singing) Fire!

03:07:35.278 --> 03:07:37.885
LAURA: Should she do turn undead?

03:07:37.885 --> 03:07:42.432
LIAM: She could turn undead, but how far are they?
They're probably too far apart. Well, no, she

03:07:42.432 --> 03:07:43.963
could stand between them and do it.

03:07:43.963 --> 03:07:45.783
LAURA: Each undead she can see within 30 feet.

03:07:45.783 --> 03:07:49.728
LIAM: 30 feet. So she stands between. She's going
to climb up on-- no, I'm not going to say that.

03:07:49.728 --> 03:07:57.499
She's going to take a step diagonally down this
way and then turnt undead.

03:07:57.499 --> 03:08:01.309
MATT: Turnt undead? That's a whole different
ability.

03:08:01.309 --> 03:08:08.522
LIAM: Wisdom saving throw. Spell save is 18. If
they're challenge rating four or lower, they're

03:08:08.522 --> 03:08:09.676
blowed up.

03:08:09.676 --> 03:08:12.717
MATT: They are not challenge rating four or lower.
It's a wisdom save?

03:08:12.717 --> 03:08:16.692
LIAM: Yeah, wisdom save, and that just means
they're scared.

03:08:16.692 --> 03:08:19.020
MATT: Yeah, they all fail.

03:08:19.020 --> 03:08:21.186
LAURA: Yeah! They're scared of her!

03:08:21.186 --> 03:08:28.090
MATT: As she holds up her holy symbol, you watch
as this radiant glow in the shape of Sarenrae

03:08:28.090 --> 03:08:33.125
emits from behind her. These giant golden wings
emerge, and for a moment, you can see the

03:08:33.125 --> 03:08:40.388
beautiful dark complexion and flaming hair rise
behind Pike. As that scatters outward, you watch

03:08:40.388 --> 03:08:45.295
as the faces of these undead troll creatures all
of a sudden shift into this look of absolute

03:08:45.295 --> 03:08:48.639
horror, and they all go (guttural groan) and begin
to make their way to turn and run.

03:08:48.639 --> 03:08:50.204
TRAVIS: Turn and run?

03:08:50.204 --> 03:08:51.637
LAURA: Yeah, they have to move away.

03:08:51.637 --> 03:08:58.741
LIAM: Move as far away as you can from the person.
Also cannot take reactions. For its action, it can

03:08:58.741 --> 03:09:02.489
use only the dash action. All they can do is run.

03:09:02.489 --> 03:09:04.645
LAURA: If it's got nowhere to move, it can use
dodge.

03:09:04.645 --> 03:09:07.085
TRAVIS: (singing) A do ron-ron-ron, a do ron-ron.

03:09:07.085 --> 03:09:08.667
MATT: Exactly. How long does that last?

03:09:08.667 --> 03:09:17.889
LAURA: It doesn't say, does it? One minute, or
until it takes any damage.

03:09:17.889 --> 03:09:24.320
MATT: Right. Okay. So that ends Pike's turn. Okay.
Grog, you're up.

03:09:24.320 --> 03:09:39.688
TRAVIS: Fe fi fo fuck it! Can I run over here?
(counting) And I'm going to smashy pants the

03:09:39.688 --> 03:09:43.457
troll. Reckless, Great Weapon Master.

03:09:43.457 --> 03:09:46.634
MATT: All right, go for it.

03:09:46.634 --> 03:09:52.865
TRAVIS: Natural 20. That's the third one today!
That's a d10, though. Right, d10?

03:09:52.865 --> 03:09:54.303
MATT: d10, yeah.

03:09:54.303 --> 03:10:07.991
TRAVIS: (counting) 63.

03:10:07.991 --> 03:10:16.576
MATT: (laughing) Oh shit. As you rush up behind,
as it's turning to run away from Pike, (snarl) it

03:10:16.576 --> 03:10:22.721
turns around and its face comes right up to yours
as you go (whack). Its jaw rockets off and

03:10:22.721 --> 03:10:24.626
scatters across the ground.

03:10:24.626 --> 03:10:26.676
LAURA: Nice. At least it can't do a bite attack
any more.

03:10:26.676 --> 03:10:27.957
MATT: You think that.

03:10:27.957 --> 03:10:29.731
TRAVIS: You think that. It's got upper teeth.

03:10:29.731 --> 03:10:34.204
MATT: Yeah. It's more of a jagged headbutt. So
that's your first attack.

03:10:34.204 --> 03:10:42.462
TRAVIS: Same thing. 19.

03:10:42.462 --> 03:10:44.458
MATT: A natural what?

03:10:44.458 --> 03:10:54.836
TRAVIS: A natural-- shit, what was it? So it was
a-- shit, I can't do reverse math.

03:10:54.836 --> 03:10:57.026
SAM: You mean subtraction.

03:10:57.026 --> 03:11:16.577
(laughter)

03:11:16.577 --> 03:11:22.510
TALIESIN: Oh man. What the hell?

03:11:22.510 --> 03:11:25.484
TRAVIS: (laughing) Oh no! That hurt my brain. It
was an eight. Thank you.

03:11:25.484 --> 03:11:27.494
MATT: All right. Does 19 hit your armor class?

03:11:27.494 --> 03:11:28.501
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:11:28.501 --> 03:11:30.040
MATT: Roll damage.

03:11:30.040 --> 03:11:44.819
TRAVIS: This guy has got up and down. Oh, no, now
I can't do math at all. 24. 34.

03:11:44.819 --> 03:11:46.975
MATT: You suffer 34 points of bludgeoning damage.

03:11:46.975 --> 03:11:50.455
TRAVIS: Nice. So 17.

03:11:50.455 --> 03:11:52.515
LIAM: So he didn't strike the troll at all?

03:11:52.515 --> 03:11:58.453
MATT: No. You knock the jaw off, and as you swing
back with a backwards strike, the arm seems to

03:11:58.453 --> 03:12:03.203
swing around in a circle, and then clobber you in
the back of the head and you're like (grunts). You

03:12:03.203 --> 03:12:06.264
spit blood on the ground, and you feel the ringing
in the back of your skull.

03:12:06.264 --> 03:12:10.456
LAURA: What the fuck is this stupid-ass hammer?

03:12:10.456 --> 03:12:11.918
TALIESIN: He's so excited.

03:12:11.918 --> 03:12:15.202
MATT: You guys look over and watch as Grog
bludgeons himself in the back of the head.

03:12:15.202 --> 03:12:18.964
MARISHA: I didn't know you were so flexible,
Grog.

03:12:18.964 --> 03:12:20.318
LAURA: Are you drunk?

03:12:20.318 --> 03:12:21.831
TRAVIS: A little, yep.

03:12:21.831 --> 03:12:26.066
MATT: Ending Grog's turn. Vax, you're up. That
guy's no longer frightened, by the way, because

03:12:26.066 --> 03:12:27.311
you did do damage to it.

03:12:27.311 --> 03:12:30.610
TRAVIS: As my bonus action-- I do have a bonus
action-- can I use my second wind?

03:12:30.610 --> 03:12:31.877
MATT: You may.

03:12:31.877 --> 03:12:39.665
TRAVIS: Thank you. 1d10. (counting) 11 points.

03:12:39.665 --> 03:12:42.655
MATT: There you go. What are you doing, Vax?

03:12:42.655 --> 03:12:48.509
LIAM: What I'm going to do is turn to Trinket
really quick and say, guard this dead thing, and

03:12:48.509 --> 03:12:56.228
then I'm going to use my movement and dash action,
if necessary, to sprint around and flank that

03:12:56.228 --> 03:12:58.373
troll between me and Grog.

03:12:58.373 --> 03:13:02.412
MATT: All right. Because it is frightened, and
it's within view of Pike, it does not make an

03:13:02.412 --> 03:13:06.767
attack of opportunity on you. It doesn't even
notice you. You step over and rush this way, and

03:13:06.767 --> 03:13:08.667
you are now there flanking it with Keyleth.

03:13:08.667 --> 03:13:09.950
LIAM: Flanking with Keyleth? Okay.

03:13:09.950 --> 03:13:12.772
MATT: You could do Scanlan if you wanted to move
there.

03:13:12.772 --> 03:13:18.276
LIAM: If Keyleth is on the other side-- as long as
I'm flanking, either way.

03:13:18.276 --> 03:13:20.463
MATT: So do you want to go the other way, against
Grog?

03:13:20.463 --> 03:13:24.168
LIAM: No, I'm fine. I'm flanking with Keyleth
right now? To the butt.

03:13:24.168 --> 03:13:26.471
MARISHA: I might drop a Fireball on your ass.

03:13:26.471 --> 03:13:36.030
LIAM: That's fine. 28 on the first. And ooh,
30-something on the second.

03:13:36.030 --> 03:13:37.563
MATT: Yeah, they both hit.

03:13:37.563 --> 03:13:53.761
LIAM: Okay, so first one is (counting) 11 plus
psychic is 12, plus those guys. (counting) 28 for

03:13:53.761 --> 03:13:55.462
that one. Sorry.

03:13:55.462 --> 03:14:04.513
MATT: 28 points of damage? Hold on. Yeah, it falls
to the ground, unmoving (gurgle) as you stab it in

03:14:04.513 --> 03:14:09.612
the back of the skull. You guys watch as the
dagger, as Whisper (splat) protrudes from the

03:14:09.612 --> 03:14:12.817
front of the skull and it (gurgle, splat) and
slumps to the ground.

03:14:12.817 --> 03:14:19.164
LIAM: That was the first one. The second one I'm
going to shove it down into its eye socket and

03:14:19.164 --> 03:14:21.863
just grind it around for the second attack, even
though it's down.

03:14:21.863 --> 03:14:24.038
MATT: Okay, so it's on the ground. It's easy
enough. You go ahead and grab the back of its

03:14:24.038 --> 03:14:29.371
motionless skull, jam in, dig around and scramble
the brains on the inside with your dagger. Okay.

03:14:29.371 --> 03:14:31.240
LIAM: That's it. Done.

03:14:31.240 --> 03:14:39.839
MATT: Ending Vax's turn. The corpse on the ground,
as you're scrambling its brains, suddenly its

03:14:39.839 --> 03:14:45.890
other eye flickers open. It reaches up and grabs
you, and from the ground, it's going to use you to

03:14:45.890 --> 03:14:47.375
pull itself back up.

03:14:47.375 --> 03:14:49.891
LAURA: We've got to chop it up or set it on fire.

03:14:49.891 --> 03:14:58.815
MATT: At this point, it's going to take a claw
attack at you. That is a 20.

03:14:58.815 --> 03:15:00.064
LIAM: Nope.

03:15:00.064 --> 03:15:05.469
MATT: As it tries to claw at you, you barely dodge
out of the way. Your hair (whoosh) as it passes.

03:15:05.469 --> 03:15:11.961
It's going to spin around and claw at Scanlan
behind with a 17?

03:15:11.961 --> 03:15:13.528
SAM: Yeah, of course.

03:15:13.528 --> 03:15:22.300
MATT: Nine points of slashing damage. And after it
finds purchase on you, it realizes that you're a

03:15:22.300 --> 03:15:26.814
little more vulnerable. Its claws still dug in
your shoulder, it's going to pull you in and it's

03:15:26.814 --> 03:15:32.129
going to attempt to, using its upper jaw, jam its
teeth down into you; the lower jaw with the tongue

03:15:32.129 --> 03:15:41.502
is dangling out at this point. That is 25.

03:15:41.502 --> 03:15:42.919
SAM: Yeah.

03:15:42.919 --> 03:15:47.109
MATT: You take five points of piercing damage and
make a constitution saving throw.

03:15:47.109 --> 03:15:49.285
LAURA: What does that mean?

03:15:49.285 --> 03:15:51.911
LIAM: I did a constitution save 20 minutes ago.

03:15:51.911 --> 03:15:53.537
LAURA: I know. I don't know what it means!

03:15:53.537 --> 03:15:55.728
SAM: That's pretty good. 23.

03:15:55.728 --> 03:16:06.408
MATT: Okay. All righty. This one's going to get
back up from the ground, it's going to crawl its

03:16:06.408 --> 03:16:10.674
way back to its feet and it's going to unload on
Pike again, as she's right there.

03:16:10.674 --> 03:16:12.529
TALIESIN: It hasn't been hit yet since she--

03:16:12.529 --> 03:16:20.127
MATT: It was dead when she did turn undead; it was
not affected by it. But it has since regenerated

03:16:20.127 --> 03:16:21.448
itself back.

03:16:21.448 --> 03:16:25.243
LIAM: Was it dead or was it undead? I'm just being
stupid; go for it.

03:16:25.243 --> 03:16:29.767
MATT: No worries. Yeah, unfortunately, its body
was not moving; it was not actively present and

03:16:29.767 --> 03:16:36.406
able to pay attention when the first effect
happened. That's four plus 11, that's not a hit.

03:16:36.406 --> 03:16:43.483
That's 15. That's a 14. Then with its bite attack
that is a 22. What's her armor class?

03:16:43.483 --> 03:16:44.837
LAURA: 23.

03:16:44.837 --> 03:16:49.727
MATT: 23 with the shield, yeah. It goes to bite
towards her, its jaw tearing open, the muscle

03:16:49.727 --> 03:16:54.952
actually stretching and pulling with each bite as
its body's falling apart, and she beats it back

03:16:54.952 --> 03:17:01.100
with her armor and shield. No effect. And this one
here, which has not been damaged, is going to go

03:17:01.100 --> 03:17:08.461
ahead and run the fuck away. You guys don't even
see where it is right now. All right. That brings

03:17:08.461 --> 03:17:10.052
us to Scanlan's turn.

03:17:10.052 --> 03:17:19.992
SAM: All right. Jesus. There's all these people
around. All right, I'm going to step away from the

03:17:19.992 --> 03:17:25.226
troll, and I'm going to light it up.

03:17:25.226 --> 03:17:26.950
MATT: Okay. As you step back, it's going to go
ahead and make--

03:17:26.950 --> 03:17:28.223
SAM: I thought it was frightened!

03:17:28.223 --> 03:17:35.805
MATT: No, it was until he hit it. It's going to
try and swing its bite at you once more.

03:17:35.805 --> 03:17:38.465
That is a 15.

03:17:38.465 --> 03:17:39.775
SAM: Yeah.

03:17:39.775 --> 03:17:42.011
LAURA: Jeez, Scanlan! You need better armor!

03:17:42.011 --> 03:17:44.471
MARISHA: Matt! Did you skip me?

03:17:44.471 --> 03:17:46.858
MATT: No, you were last; you're after Scanlan.

03:17:46.858 --> 03:17:49.583
TRAVIS: Yeah, remember you rolled shit?

03:17:49.583 --> 03:17:52.372
MARISHA: No, I know. Yeah, no, I remember that.

03:17:52.372 --> 03:17:54.456
MATT: Or did I skip you last turn, you mean?

03:17:54.456 --> 03:17:58.063
MARISHA: This is the second time he's going,
right?

03:17:58.063 --> 03:17:59.951
MATT: Correct. Oh, I must have skipped you last
turn! I'm so sorry!

03:17:59.951 --> 03:18:03.983
MARISHA: It's okay. I don't think I've done
anything yet. I've only dodged.

03:18:03.983 --> 03:18:08.075
MATT: No, I'll give you two rounds after this.
It's my fault. That's totally my fault.

03:18:08.075 --> 03:18:09.288
I'm sorry.

03:18:09.288 --> 03:18:10.476
MARISHA: That's okay.

03:18:10.476 --> 03:18:17.038
MATT: So anyway, that's six points of piercing
damage to you. Make a constitution saving throw.

03:18:17.038 --> 03:18:18.914
SAM: Ooh, natural 20.

03:18:18.914 --> 03:18:23.079
MATT: All right. Keyleth. What are you doing,
twice, because it's my fault?

03:18:23.079 --> 03:18:24.832
SAM: It's still my turn.

03:18:24.832 --> 03:18:25.972
MATT: Oh, that's right, sorry.

03:18:25.972 --> 03:18:29.247
SAM: Fireball! Wand of Fireball.

03:18:29.247 --> 03:18:30.871
MATT: To who?

03:18:30.871 --> 03:18:34.673
SAM: To that troll who just hit me. I was backing
away.

03:18:34.673 --> 03:18:37.240
LAURA: You're going to smoke everybody?

03:18:37.240 --> 03:18:38.949
SAM: I asked!

03:18:38.949 --> 03:18:40.322
LIAM: I'll be fine.

03:18:40.322 --> 03:18:45.828
MARISHA: You can place it to where it might hit
both of them and not us.

03:18:45.828 --> 03:18:47.694
SAM: Is it that big?

03:18:47.694 --> 03:18:49.514
LIAM: Yeah, dude.

03:18:49.514 --> 03:18:52.233
SAM: Oh shit! Well, then yeah, I'm smoking them
both.

03:18:52.233 --> 03:18:58.718
MATT: All right. In order to do that, you're going
to hit Pike, Vax, and Grog.

03:18:58.718 --> 03:19:00.312
SAM: Sorry, friends!

03:19:00.312 --> 03:19:01.766
MATT: That's okay. Pike has fire resistance.

03:19:01.766 --> 03:19:03.790
TRAVIS: You don't have to hit me!

03:19:03.790 --> 03:19:09.301
MATT: I need Grog, Vax and Pike to make dexterity
saving throws.

03:19:09.301 --> 03:19:11.634
LAURA: Is it possible to do it without hitting
Grog?

03:19:11.634 --> 03:19:19.973
MATT: No. Not at that size. He probably could, but
it'll hit Trinket. Your choice.

03:19:19.973 --> 03:19:21.998
LAURA: It's Scanlan's choice.

03:19:21.998 --> 03:19:25.264
MATT: Scanlan, Grog or Trinket? You're going to
hit one or the other.

03:19:25.264 --> 03:19:29.858
SAM: Absolutely Grog. I love my Trinket.

03:19:29.858 --> 03:19:32.326
TRAVIS: But he just goes back into the necklace.

03:19:32.326 --> 03:19:36.544
SAM: All right, you're right. Then I'll hit
Trinket.

03:19:36.544 --> 03:19:39.307
LAURA: You're a dick.

03:19:39.307 --> 03:19:42.116
MATT: All right. Roll a dexterity save for
Trinket.

03:19:42.116 --> 03:19:43.723
LAURA: Oh, motherfuck!

03:19:43.723 --> 03:19:46.838
LIAM: I already rolled terribly for Pike.

03:19:46.838 --> 03:19:54.178
SAM: It's a wand, so I'm using three charges. It's
10d6.

03:19:54.178 --> 03:19:57.586
MATT: Oh! Right! All right. So 10d6 points of fire
damage.

03:19:57.586 --> 03:19:59.069
LAURA: 11.

03:19:59.069 --> 03:20:02.741
SAM: I have zero d6 right now. I don't what
happened to mine.

03:20:02.741 --> 03:20:06.682
LIAM: Pike got a five. Vax got a 20.

03:20:06.682 --> 03:20:13.050
MATT: Okay, and your spell, what's the DC on the
wand? 15? So yeah, you succeed. You take no

03:20:13.050 --> 03:20:14.988
damage, being a rogue.

03:20:14.988 --> 03:20:16.227
LIAM: Lovely.

03:20:16.227 --> 03:20:37.607
MATT: That's a good roll.

03:20:37.607 --> 03:20:39.023
SAM: 40.

03:20:39.023 --> 03:20:43.405
MATT: So 40 points of fire damage. 20 to Pike,
because she's resistant. None to that. 40 to

03:20:43.405 --> 03:21:02.533
Trinket. You watch as both of the standing trolls
scatter to ash. They turn to burned dust and

03:21:02.533 --> 03:21:08.418
nothing as their bodies are consumed by the flame
of the Fireball, leaving nothing but smoke and a

03:21:08.418 --> 03:21:13.947
shadow of their form against the wall. All right,
Scanlan. That ends your turn?

03:21:13.947 --> 03:21:20.646
SAM: Yeah, and to refresh, that's a wand. Does
that still use my spell slot?

03:21:20.646 --> 03:21:22.828
MATT: No, the wand has charges on it.

03:21:22.828 --> 03:21:26.728
LAURA: Can you use that wand again?

03:21:26.728 --> 03:21:30.768
SAM: Yeah, it regenerates after a long rest. I
have to roll for it.

03:21:30.768 --> 03:21:33.333
LIAM: But it's not a one-shot; it's got several
charges, right?

03:21:33.333 --> 03:21:35.530
SAM: It's got several charges. It's got more in
it.

03:21:35.530 --> 03:21:38.279
MATT: Did you write down how many charges it has?

03:21:38.279 --> 03:21:43.223
TALIESIN: Vax, do you want to check for traps and
see if there's anything interesting in there?

03:21:43.223 --> 03:21:49.126
MATT: Keyleth, what do you want to do? There's
still one troll over here that ran out of sight.

03:21:49.126 --> 03:21:52.099
MARISHA: He ran out of sight?

03:21:52.099 --> 03:21:55.606
SAM: Well, let's go plunder the loot.

03:21:55.606 --> 03:22:01.075
MARISHA: You guys go plunder the loot. I'll creep
over.

03:22:01.075 --> 03:22:05.826
MATT: I'm sorry about missing your turn. I feel so
bad about it.

03:22:05.826 --> 03:22:07.839
MARISHA: That's okay! You're so cute.

03:22:07.839 --> 03:22:11.009
MATT: So you're going where?

03:22:11.009 --> 03:22:12.855
MARISHA: I want to see if I can see him.

03:22:12.855 --> 03:22:16.266
MATT: Six, and you're going to dash with your
action to move over?

03:22:16.266 --> 03:22:17.708
MARISHA: Can I not see him?

03:22:17.708 --> 03:22:26.228
MATT: Not with your basic movement, no. There's a
wall. Okay, so you move around the corner and you

03:22:26.228 --> 03:22:31.631
watch as the troll is currently locked in the
corner with its back to the wall, going,

03:22:31.631 --> 03:22:34.510
(monster noises).

03:22:34.510 --> 03:22:41.672
MARISHA: I go, hey it's okay, calm-- Fireball! Out
of the staff.

03:22:41.672 --> 03:22:43.151
MATT: Okay.

03:22:43.151 --> 03:22:49.061
TRAVIS: Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

03:22:49.061 --> 03:22:58.957
MATT: Yeah, no, that won't hit anything but
himself and the surrounding chamber. Go ahead and

03:22:58.957 --> 03:23:00.407
roll damage on that.

03:23:00.407 --> 03:23:04.261
MARISHA: (counting) Can I get two more d6s from
you?

03:23:04.261 --> 03:23:06.227
MATT: You're doing a standard 8d6?

03:23:06.227 --> 03:23:19.175
MARISHA: It's out of my staff. I can't do any
more, right? Reroll, yep. (singing) Like a d6,

03:23:19.175 --> 03:23:35.381
like a like a d6! (counting) 35 damage.

03:23:35.381 --> 03:23:42.520
MATT: 35 damage. All righty. (explosion) The
explosion hits and bursts around. The flames burn,

03:23:42.520 --> 03:23:47.829
and you can see some flames are catching on the
troll. (monster noises). Still alive.

03:23:47.829 --> 03:23:54.354
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to take my bonus action
to do something I've never done before. I'm going

03:23:54.354 --> 03:23:59.726
to trace, from my staff, and pull out a flame
blade. (shing)

03:23:59.726 --> 03:24:05.475
MATT: Okay! So you guys watch as Keyleth puts her
fingers across the top of the staff. Where her

03:24:05.475 --> 03:24:11.814
fingers arc around, it creates this arc of fire,
and when she stops she grabs on to a hilt that

03:24:11.814 --> 03:24:16.940
didn't exist, but now does, in her hand. That arc
of flame that stayed suddenly solidifies into a

03:24:16.940 --> 03:24:18.570
scimitar-like blade that's in her hand.

03:24:18.570 --> 03:24:21.357
LAURA: You can do that?!

03:24:21.357 --> 03:24:23.077
LIAM: She's a fucking Jedi!

03:24:23.077 --> 03:24:26.215
MATT: All right, that ends your turn? All right,
Percy.

03:24:26.215 --> 03:24:30.192
LAURA: You didn't even see it!

03:24:30.192 --> 03:24:39.508
LIAM: I can imagine it in the abstract universe,
though. I sure can, Laura Bailey! I sure can!

03:24:39.508 --> 03:24:44.749
SAM: Well, look who's back in the fight.

03:24:44.749 --> 03:24:49.801
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's all. Ain't nothing else
happening. Just taking a look. Yeah, she's got this.

03:24:49.801 --> 03:24:56.748
MATT: All right, ends Percival's turn. Vex, you're
up.

03:24:56.748 --> 03:25:07.516
LAURA: No, I'm going to fly over. Can I get to a
place where I can see the troll? Well, how many is this?

03:25:07.516 --> 03:25:09.252
MATT: Are you going to fly down?

03:25:09.252 --> 03:25:12.448
LAURA: I have 50 feet on my broom.

03:25:12.448 --> 03:25:15.610
LIAM: You could dash. Broom dash.

03:25:15.610 --> 03:25:17.330
MATT: You'd get right around there and see it.

03:25:17.330 --> 03:25:20.945
LAURA: I'm going to shoot him! And he's still
Hunter's Marked!

03:25:20.945 --> 03:25:22.346
MATT: He is, yes.

03:25:22.346 --> 03:25:26.492
LAURA: 17?

03:25:26.492 --> 03:25:28.896
MATT: 17 does hit.

03:25:28.896 --> 03:25:43.111
LAURA: Oh, thank god. I didn't say it; it didn't
happen. 13 plus three lightning damage. Plus one

03:25:43.111 --> 03:25:44.574
Hunter's Mark.

03:25:44.574 --> 03:25:50.065
MATT: The first strike hits it. It still has the
fire trailing up its body. Second shot?

03:25:50.065 --> 03:25:53.217
LAURA: 21.

03:25:53.217 --> 03:25:54.088
MATT: That hits.

03:25:54.088 --> 03:25:56.243
SAM: Say the thing that you wanted to say.

03:25:56.243 --> 03:26:06.210
LAURA: The Blazing Bowstring? Blazing Bowstring.
Sorry. I only get two per short rest, so if we

03:26:06.210 --> 03:26:18.149
don't rest, then I don't get it again! Six
lightning damage, plus nine, plus two. 11.

03:26:18.149 --> 03:26:26.681
MATT: Both arrows hit it in the chest. One, two!
It's still standing there, the flames curling

03:26:26.681 --> 03:26:29.456
around it. The ceiling, by the way, from the
impact of the Fireball,

03:26:29.456 --> 03:26:35.080
is looking pretty fragile.

03:26:35.080 --> 03:26:38.280
LAURA: But that's the exit. That's where we need
to go to?

03:26:38.280 --> 03:26:43.834
MATT: You do see, Keyleth, from this perspective,
there's a small opening on the far wall where it

03:26:43.834 --> 03:26:47.611
looks like possibly whoever raided this vault had
previously tunneled into it.

03:26:47.611 --> 03:26:52.037
LAURA: Shit! Would Trinket have been able to make
it over to him?

03:26:52.037 --> 03:27:04.348
MATT: It would've been really close. Probably not.
You don't know. It's possible. End of your turn,

03:27:04.348 --> 03:27:06.112
Vex? Pike's up.

03:27:06.112 --> 03:27:19.350
LIAM: Pike saw Keyleth go running down that way,
so she is going to run after her. (counting) She

03:27:19.350 --> 03:27:21.421
can't see the troll from there, right?

03:27:21.421 --> 03:27:23.521
MATT: She can see the troll just past the corner,
there.

03:27:23.521 --> 03:27:26.233
LIAM: She can see the troll? Oh my god, I think
it's time for a Guiding Bolt!

03:27:26.233 --> 03:27:28.155
LAURA: (singing) Guiding Bolt up the butt!

03:27:28.155 --> 03:27:33.534
MATT: That's our next T-shirt. Guiding Bolt up the
butt!

03:27:33.534 --> 03:27:39.829
LIAM: Range 120 feet. A flash of light streaks
toward a creature of your choice within range.

03:27:39.829 --> 03:27:43.469
Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On
a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage and the

03:27:43.469 --> 03:27:50.664
next attack roll-- okay. Yeah, make a spell ranged
attack plus ten, because it's Pike. Yeah, you've

03:27:50.664 --> 03:27:59.615
got to attack. Yo, here's the white die you gave
me. 13 plus ten is 23.

03:27:59.615 --> 03:28:01.776
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

03:28:01.776 --> 03:28:05.639
TRAVIS: Extra damage because it's undead?

03:28:05.639 --> 03:28:10.999
LAURA: I don't think so. 12. Guiding Bolt!

03:28:10.999 --> 03:28:21.654
LIAM: Specifically toward the taint, Matt. Pike's
on a tear today.

03:28:21.654 --> 03:28:27.361
MATT: All right, so. As she comes around the
corner, the holy symbol in one hand, clutching

03:28:27.361 --> 03:28:32.557
behind the shield, she notches the edge of the 
mace at the edge of her belt and releases a bolt

03:28:32.557 --> 03:28:44.190
of energy. How do you want to do this? Because the
radiant damage shuts down the undead fortitude,

03:28:44.190 --> 03:28:47.995
and the fire knocks down the regeneration.

03:28:47.995 --> 03:28:53.915
LIAM: The Guiding Bolt streaks through the air,
loops down to the ground, up through the butt, up

03:28:53.915 --> 03:29:04.063
out the head, and out the mouth. Everyone vaguely
hears, "That's my Pike." And its head explodes.

03:29:04.063 --> 03:29:09.652
MATT: You see the radiant energy bursting out of
its eyes, and as it screams, its head blasted

03:29:09.652 --> 03:29:13.935
upward, the energy bursting through its mouth, the jaw
begins to burn away as the flames left over from

03:29:13.935 --> 03:29:18.563
the Fireball consume the rest of its body. It
tumbles to its knees and burns into this skeletal

03:29:18.563 --> 03:29:20.742
mass that turns to ash on the ground.

03:29:20.742 --> 03:29:24.757
LIAM: That happened in six seconds. It was like,
(explosions).

03:29:24.757 --> 03:29:27.593
LAURA: We need to get out of here. It's
crumbling.

03:29:27.593 --> 03:29:29.032
TRAVIS: There are chests about.

03:29:29.032 --> 03:29:35.481
MARISHA: I take my flaming sword and do a few Jedi
kid moves. When no one's looking, go

03:29:35.481 --> 03:29:38.828
(lightsaber noises).

03:29:38.828 --> 03:29:43.203
LAURA: I go check for traps on that chest right
there.

03:29:43.203 --> 03:29:48.309
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:29:48.309 --> 03:29:54.530
LAURA: 14.

03:29:54.530 --> 03:29:57.433
MATT: 14? Okay. Does not appear to be trapped.

03:29:57.433 --> 03:29:59.232
LAURA: All right, then I'm going to open it.

03:29:59.232 --> 03:30:04.997
MATT: You open it? There are seven gold pieces,
two silver, and the rest of it's empty.

03:30:04.997 --> 03:30:09.708
LAURA: Awesome. Look at all this money!

03:30:09.708 --> 03:30:13.036
TALIESIN: I'll check for traps.

03:30:13.036 --> 03:30:15.361
MATT: Investigation check.

03:30:15.361 --> 03:30:22.789
TALIESIN: It's a 22.

03:30:22.789 --> 03:30:26.375
MATT: 22, okay. Room does not appear to be
trapped, from what you can see.

03:30:26.375 --> 03:30:30.729
TALIESIN: I'm going to check that trunk. The
chest.

03:30:30.729 --> 03:30:33.643
MATT: You're going to check that for traps, as
well?

03:30:33.643 --> 03:30:38.235
TALIESIN: This is not quite as-- seven.

03:30:38.235 --> 03:30:41.068
MATT: Make a perception check. Seven? Doesn't
appear to be trapped.

03:30:41.068 --> 03:30:42.487
TALIESIN: I open it.

03:30:42.487 --> 03:30:48.797
MATT: Opens. It's not locked. There's about 12
pieces of gold, two copper, a silver. This place

03:30:48.797 --> 03:30:50.494
has been cleared out.

03:30:50.494 --> 03:30:54.142
LAURA: I'm going to pick up that little pile of
gold, those couple pieces of gold

03:30:54.142 --> 03:30:55.515
I see on the ground.

03:30:55.515 --> 03:31:02.826
MATT: You gather what amounts to about 35 gold
pieces from there. Keyleth, what did you roll? 26?

03:31:02.826 --> 03:31:08.142
You're watching as one of the supports that-- The
ceilings here are pretty solid. The one on the far

03:31:08.142 --> 03:31:13.583
end here has sustained damage from the Fireball
and the drilling entry of whoever came in here

03:31:13.583 --> 03:31:17.640
previously, and the constant moves of the titan.
At which point, you watch and you feel the

03:31:17.640 --> 03:31:22.813
(rumbling), the most recent footfall of the titan.
The whole ceiling right there in the corner goes

03:31:22.813 --> 03:31:28.939
(crashing). This entire chamber.

03:31:28.939 --> 03:31:30.967
SAM: The door's covered!

03:31:30.967 --> 03:31:34.275
LAURA: Can you get through it, Keyleth?

03:31:34.275 --> 03:31:36.881
TRAVIS: Remember, there were three different ways,
though, and we took one.

03:31:36.881 --> 03:31:39.578
SAM: That's the one we need, though.

03:31:39.578 --> 03:31:47.536
LIAM: Okay, realizing that the druid and the
goliath are going to have to figure that out, Vax

03:31:47.536 --> 03:31:52.517
walks to the middle there and starts to take a wee
in the corner. It's been a long time.

03:31:52.517 --> 03:31:57.418
TRAVIS: Do we want to go through the collapsed
doorway, or do we want to go back to one of the

03:31:57.418 --> 03:31:58.874
other tunnels?

03:31:58.874 --> 03:32:03.572
LAURA: Whatever other tunnel options, there's
probably other monsters, trolls, fucking undead

03:32:03.572 --> 03:32:04.840
waiting there, too.

03:32:04.840 --> 03:32:14.435
SAM: This is on you, Grog. No, don't use any
spells. Don't use any spells. Grog, punch through

03:32:14.435 --> 03:32:15.404
this shit.

03:32:15.404 --> 03:32:23.877
MARISHA: Wait, I can Commune with Nature and maybe
figure out the tunnel system, or depending on

03:32:23.877 --> 03:32:28.634
where we are and if we think we're on that time
crunch and we want to get going-- I didn't want to

03:32:28.634 --> 03:32:34.174
burn this yet. I did bring Find the Path, which is
a one-day concentration spell which gets us to

03:32:34.174 --> 03:32:43.160
where we want to go as quick as possible. But I
don't know. Can I do that with Thar Amphala?

03:32:43.160 --> 03:32:46.334
SAM: Don't you need to know where you're going for
that spell to work?

03:32:46.334 --> 03:32:48.797
MARISHA: Well, if we're getting to Thar Amphala.

03:32:48.797 --> 03:32:50.945
SAM: It's a big city.

03:32:50.945 --> 03:32:58.750
MATT: It's concentration for up to one day, but if
you lose concentration halfway through--

03:32:58.750 --> 03:33:03.735
MARISHA: Which is why I haven't wanted to do it
yet, until we felt like we needed to go.

03:33:03.735 --> 03:33:08.020
MATT: To a specific, fixed location you're
familiar with in the same plane of existence. So

03:33:08.020 --> 03:33:13.513
you could, in theory, say, "Thar Amphala," and it
would guide you to the fastest path there until

03:33:13.513 --> 03:33:15.140
you lost concentration.

03:33:15.140 --> 03:33:24.351
MARISHA: I'm just saying, we have that at our
disposal when we feel. Do we want to do a quick

03:33:24.351 --> 03:33:28.002
Commune with Nature, then, to try and get paths?
It's going to take a few minutes, though.

03:33:28.002 --> 03:33:29.573
SAM: What would that tell you?

03:33:29.573 --> 03:33:35.495
MARISHA: I could get an idea of the tunnel system
for a three-mile radius.

03:33:35.495 --> 03:33:40.144
LIAM: Yeah, let her do her thing. I think we can
afford a few minutes. Then Grog could finish

03:33:40.144 --> 03:33:43.620
attuning-- oh, you did. That "stop hitting
yourself" hammer was attuned.

03:33:43.620 --> 03:33:47.557
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, have I finished attuning with the
black hammer of face-smash?

03:33:47.557 --> 03:33:52.075
SAM: Is the hammer called the Stop Hitting
Yourself hammer?

03:33:52.075 --> 03:33:57.252
MATT: Best you can make out with it, it is an
adamantine hammer, but there is something wrong

03:33:57.252 --> 03:34:05.075
about its enchantment. There is something about it
that is locked into your soul at the moment. It's

03:34:05.075 --> 03:34:10.784
occupying a portion of yourself.

03:34:10.784 --> 03:34:14.383
LIAM: You are going to crit on Vecna and K.O.
yourself.

03:34:14.383 --> 03:34:21.773
MATT: Pike, you guys have dealt with cursed items
before. This is a cursed item.

03:34:21.773 --> 03:34:27.137
LIAM: Greater Restoration? I'm looking.

03:34:27.137 --> 03:34:32.531
TRAVIS: Do I know it's cursed? It's a familiar
feeling? From Craven Edge?

03:34:32.531 --> 03:34:38.486
MATT: Well, Craven wasn't cursed. Craven was
intelligent. This is something has sunk into you.

03:34:38.486 --> 03:34:42.535
LAURA: She's going to try to Greater Restoration
Grog.

03:34:42.535 --> 03:34:51.479
LIAM: She'll grab him by the cheeks and squish the
cheeks and say, "Grog, don't go touching things

03:34:51.479 --> 03:34:54.179
"you don't know what they are!" Cast Greater
Restoration.

03:34:54.179 --> 03:35:00.299
MATT: Okay, so mark off the Greater Restoration.
As you feel the hammer in your hand, it's like

03:35:00.299 --> 03:35:05.087
your fingers won't let go of it. They're almost
clenched to it. The minute she touches you, you

03:35:05.087 --> 03:35:10.435
feel this warmth pass through your body, through
your arms, to your hand. With that, your fingers

03:35:10.435 --> 03:35:16.647
widen and the hammer falls to the ground, there.
That hold that it had on you is lifted.

03:35:16.647 --> 03:35:19.510
TRAVIS: I think I'm going to leave this here, if
that's cool with you guys.

03:35:19.510 --> 03:35:27.222
LIAM: She gives you the mom look and says, "Don't
touch it, okay?"

03:35:27.222 --> 03:35:31.658
LAURA: Do you have time to attune to your other
thing?

03:35:31.658 --> 03:35:35.134
TRAIVS: Yeah, I'll pick up the Bloodaxe out of
the Bag of Holding and start attuning to that

03:35:35.194 --> 03:35:38.350
again. Old trusty Bloodaxe.

03:35:38.350 --> 03:35:49.253
MATT: So you guys are taking a short rest to
attune? In caves and other natural underground

03:35:49.253 --> 03:35:56.164
settings. Make a nature check. The radius is only
300 feet when you're underground.

03:35:56.164 --> 03:36:03.672
MARISHA: Okay, 25.

03:36:03.672 --> 03:36:09.843
MATT: 25. One, this is not a natural underground
location. The entirety of this area is the inside

03:36:09.843 --> 03:36:14.973
of an ancient, powerful elemental entity. Also,
the spell doesn't function where nature has been

03:36:14.973 --> 03:36:18.677
replaced by construction, such as dungeons and
towns, so for the most part, that spell would not

03:36:18.677 --> 03:36:21.085
aid you. My apologies.

03:36:21.085 --> 03:36:24.036
MARISHA: But you're not letting me cast it,
right?

03:36:24.036 --> 03:36:28.254
MATT: I'm not letting you cast it. That nature
check was to see whether or not the surroundings

03:36:28.254 --> 03:36:34.125
would help you, so you know not to waste that
spell. So as you take your short rest, you attune

03:36:34.125 --> 03:36:38.198
to your proper weapon, and you begin to talk
amongst yourselves as to what the next proper path

03:36:38.198 --> 03:36:45.636
or action to take is as you climb through the
crypts toward your destination, we're going to go

03:36:45.636 --> 03:36:48.880
ahead and end tonight's session there. It's just
past 11.

03:36:48.880 --> 03:36:51.045
TRAVIS: I've got to take a picture of this.

03:36:51.045 --> 03:37:03.871
MATT: Great game, guys. Well done. We'll pick this
up in a couple weeks. This is an upward dungeon

03:37:03.871 --> 03:37:05.497
crawl. This is fun.

03:37:05.497 --> 03:37:12.428
TRAVIS: He must have fallen against a mountain in
an upright manner.

03:37:12.428 --> 03:37:20.608
MATT: Oh, the titan? The titan was thrust into the
ground in a mountain range. The mountain range

03:37:20.608 --> 03:37:25.769
rose up around it. Technically you wouldn't know
this, but it doesn't matter. Part of the battle

03:37:25.769 --> 03:37:30.130
that smote the titan thrust it downward and
created the mountain range around it.

03:37:30.130 --> 03:37:34.731
TRAVIS: That's amazing. Nice job, Matt!

03:37:34.731 --> 03:37:38.806
MATT: Nice job, you guys! That was awesome.
We'll pick this up in a couple weeks. You guys

03:37:38.806 --> 03:37:43.216
will return next week, where you'll get to see
this awesome man run his awesome game!

03:37:43.216 --> 03:37:49.080
SAM: It's going to be awesome! It's all set in the
world of Alice in Wonderland.

03:37:49.080 --> 03:37:50.482
LAURA: Is it?

03:37:50.482 --> 03:37:51.506
SAM: No!

03:37:51.506 --> 03:38:03.660
LIAM: Guys, have so much fucking fun on the playa.
Recharge, reset, energize, go nuts. Miss you.

03:38:03.660 --> 03:38:05.193
MATT: We'll miss you too, guys.

03:38:05.193 --> 03:38:10.700
SAM: Any Critters who are on the playa with these
guys, they will take off their clothes if you ask them.

03:38:10.700 --> 03:38:16.938
LIAM: No! They need to recharge! Give them some
space, let them recharge!

03:38:16.938 --> 03:38:21.877
MARISHA: If you see me topless, please don't take
a photo.

03:38:21.877 --> 03:38:24.775
MATT: Why would you say that?!

03:38:24.775 --> 03:38:33.939
MARISHA: It was a joke! It was a fucking joke that
the internet will take too seriously, I'm sure.

03:38:33.939 --> 03:38:38.492
LIAM: I'll be topless on Sam's one-shot. You can
look at me instead.

03:38:38.492 --> 03:38:42.320
MARISHA: If you see Liam topless, take all the
photos.

03:38:42.320 --> 03:38:45.964
LIAM: Push-ups for seven days; here we go!

03:38:45.964 --> 03:38:55.635
MATT: All right, guys. Well, we're going to take
off. Thank you so much for joining us tonight.

03:38:55.635 --> 03:39:00.740
Rest well, and is it Thursday yet? Good night!

03:39:00.740 --> 03:45:25.173
