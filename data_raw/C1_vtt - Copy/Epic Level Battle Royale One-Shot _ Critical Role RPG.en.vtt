00:00:00.436 --> 00:00:03.031
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:11.452
sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. This
evening, we're about to dive into our final game

00:00:11.452 --> 00:00:17.109
of the year before we go away for the holidays,
and then return in the new year to begin our new

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:23.481
campaign. So tonight, instead, we're going to have
the members of Vox Machina who could be here--

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:29.157
unfortunately, Ashley is still in New York. Laura
is busy being at the Video Game Awards because she

00:00:29.157 --> 00:00:37.092
was nominated for Best Actress. So we're sending
all the awesome, positive thoughts her way and

00:00:37.092 --> 00:00:43.275
wishing her luck. And we all knew Vex was going to
go out in the first half anyway. That's not true.

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:51.971
But we miss you, Laura. We do have a sponsor
tonight. We have, for this fantastic episode,

00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:57.663
Marvel Puzzle Quest returns to sponsor an episode.
Thank you so much, Marvel Puzzle Quest! Sam?

00:00:57.663 --> 00:01:05.443
SAM: Guys, for the sponsorship opportunity, I know
that I have this habit of doing a bit, doing some

00:01:05.443 --> 00:01:11.230
comedy at the top of the show, and it's all funny
and clever and brilliant and all that. But today,

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:18.862
I'm just going to do it serious. This is a serious
sponsor and they need our serious, unadulterated

00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:24.488
attention. So I'm just going to read the copy, I
swear to god. Okay. Our sponsor tonight is Marvel

00:01:24.488 --> 00:01:32.226
Puzzle Quest. Recruit all your favorite Avengers,
from Black Panther, Captain America, (fart noise)

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:38.898
Iron Man, The Hulk (fart noise), Black Widow, and
more! (extended fart) Create a super-villain dream

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:49.760
team and recruit Infinity Gauntlet-wielding Thanos
to wage your own war! (excessive fart noises) Mix

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.608
and match to create the ultimate team of three,
and battle it out in Match Three War! (squeaky fart)

00:01:55.608 --> 00:02:05.202
Marvel Puzzle Quest is available on iOS,
Android, Amazon, and Steam. Download it now for

00:02:05.202 --> 00:02:11.588
free. (so many fart noises)

00:02:11.588 --> 00:02:13.530
MATT: God, Sam, holy shit.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.820
SAM: I just read the copy!

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.050
MARISHA: Your own joke broke you.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.477
TALIESIN: What episode is this?! How many episodes
did it take to finally get to this?

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:25.415
TRAVIS: Marvel Puzzle Quest gets the best stuff.

00:02:25.415 --> 00:02:32.226
MATT: We have officially hit &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; level in our
game.

00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:34.601
TALIESIN: We have steamed the shark.

00:02:34.601 --> 00:02:39.487
LIAM: You've got to be careful. Marvel Marketing
is going to start stealing from your bucket of

00:02:39.487 --> 00:02:41.767
tricks. We're going to see trailers with farts.

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:50.738
MATT: All righty. So let's see. Other
announcements? We have a quick one tonight, I

00:02:50.738 --> 00:02:52.076
think.

00:02:52.076 --> 00:03:02.906
MARISHA: There's the charity stream with Satine on
Saturday. The Roll20 dealio that she's doing is

00:03:02.906 --> 00:03:05.025
this Saturday, all-day D&amp;amp;D for charity.

00:03:05.025 --> 00:03:08.884
MATT: This is actually a continuation of a charity
event that Satine's been running for years, where

00:03:08.884 --> 00:03:14.734
me and her first played D&amp;amp;D together years ago.
She asked me to be a charity DM and me and Keith

00:03:14.734 --> 00:03:20.276
Baker ran games at Meltdown, years ago. So it's an
awesome group, awesome games. Please check it out.

00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:21.871
Support it if you can.

00:03:21.871 --> 00:03:25.572
MARISHA: That was the early days of streaming RPGs
online, before it was a thing.

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:35.414
MATT: Yeah, it was rough. But it was fun. It was a
good time. So yeah, check that out. Next Thursday

00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:40.056
will be our big wrap-up. We've been asking
questions of the community. There's been a lot of

00:03:40.056 --> 00:03:46.778
really great questions. So we got through as many
as we possibly can for this episode next Thursday

00:03:46.778 --> 00:03:49.467
to answer a lot of questions about the campaign,
the world, things that went unanswered,

00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:55.146
curiosities that you may have been holding on to.
The ones that we didn't get to, we might carry

00:03:55.146 --> 00:03:58.855
over into the first week of the new year or
something. We'll figure it out. We want to get

00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:03.142
through as many of these as we can, but we have a
large bulk of them coming to you next Thursday in

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:09.125
this time slot. So check it out next week! Let's
see. Any other announcements you guys want to

00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:10.545
bring up?

00:04:10.545 --> 00:04:14.243
TRAVIS: Laura would pull my lower lip over my head
if I didn't say that the beautiful Critical Role

00:04:14.243 --> 00:04:20.693
notebook is in the merch store. It's gorgeous. I
don't hold it up and Vanna White it as nice as she

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:27.844
does, but it's in there. Laura and I will be at
SacAnime in Sacramento the first week of January.

00:04:27.844 --> 00:04:32.111
January 5th through the 7th, I think it is. We'll
be in Sacramento.

00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:40.192
MATT: Also, me and Marisha are both happy to be
hosting with the folks who make Gwent. If you're

00:04:40.192 --> 00:04:42.441
familiar with the Witcher, they have their own
card game.

00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:44.113
LIAM: You don't like Witcher, though.

00:04:44.113 --> 00:04:49.574
MATT: Yeah, I'm not a fan. But we're helping host
their upcoming Gwent tournament next weekend,

00:04:49.574 --> 00:04:55.543
Friday and Saturday. I can't really say the
specifics of it because they're going to announce

00:04:55.543 --> 00:05:03.499
it on their own time, but it's going to be fun.
Somewhere in the Europes. But yes, we'll be there.

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:09.528
We'll have information on our Twitters and social
media if you want to follow and check out both

00:05:09.528 --> 00:05:13.092
Gwent. We're streaming tomorrow morning, actually,
our last stream of us getting prepped, and we're

00:05:13.092 --> 00:05:16.141
meeting with a bunch of guys in the community that
are showing us the ins and outs of some of the

00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:23.479
factions and decks. So if you're like us and up
early tomorrow on Twitch, we'll be there. We'll

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.416
figure out all of the information on Twitter. All
right. Anything else, guys?

00:05:28.416 --> 00:05:35.597
TALIESIN: Did podcast get updated, or did that not
happen? It may not have.

00:05:35.597 --> 00:05:37.173
MARISHA: It's coming.

00:05:37.173 --> 00:05:43.382
TALIESIN: Comic book issue three is available.
It's beautiful. And there's now two playlists out

00:05:43.382 --> 00:05:46.072
because I didn't announce my playlist last week.
Percy's playlist went out and now there's a Vex

00:05:46.072 --> 00:05:47.891
podcast.

00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:54.670
MARISHA: I'm working on it. I started writing
today.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:00.804
TRAVIS: I don't have one because it was going to
be all death metal, followed with nursery rhymes.

00:06:00.804 --> 00:06:03.333
TALIESIN: I would like to know what kind of death
metal you're into.

00:06:03.333 --> 00:06:05.325
TRAVIS: Technonic.

00:06:05.325 --> 00:06:13.617
MARISHA: Also, big deal. This is a big one.
Talking about merch. This is a true story. We

00:06:13.617 --> 00:06:22.486
found a bunch of extra David Mack posters that we
autographed and signed as hold-over, in case

00:06:22.486 --> 00:06:28.984
anything was damaged or shipping was messed up.
Yeah, in case life happened. So we signed about a

00:06:28.984 --> 00:06:34.359
hundred extra and we magically found them the
other day. So your last chance--

00:06:34.359 --> 00:06:36.340
SAM: Can you tell me where we found them?

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.614
MARISHA: It was somewhere, I think, literally in
the boiler room.

00:06:41.614 --> 00:06:43.877
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was about to say, it was
probably the boiler room because that's where shit

00:06:43.877 --> 00:06:48.999
goes and vanishes. We are kind of a mess on
occasion, this is true.

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:54.011
MARISHA: No, we're a web company. We wouldn't be a
mess.

00:06:54.011 --> 00:06:57.906
MATT: Individually and as a collective fumbling
our way through existence day to day.

00:06:57.906 --> 00:07:03.044
MARISHA: But anyway, they are in the store right
now. This is your last chance. If you're like, "Oh

00:07:03.044 --> 00:07:09.791
"no, I saw them!" But only a hundred-- and they're
gone. So yeah, last-minute Christmas present for

00:07:09.791 --> 00:07:12.803
anyone who was looking for something.

00:07:12.803 --> 00:07:21.067
LIAM: Marisha and I came out in another episode of
Madness. Some more improvised gameplay with

00:07:21.067 --> 00:07:22.213
blocks.

00:07:22.213 --> 00:07:24.721
MARISHA: If you're not watching it, holy crap. Go
watch it.

00:07:24.721 --> 00:07:32.013
MATT: Awesome. All right. I believe that brings us
to the conclusion of our announcements. And

00:07:32.013 --> 00:07:40.110
finishing that up, let's bring us to tonight's
special Level 20 Battle Royale episode of Critical

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.792
Role.

00:07:41.792 --> 00:09:11.220
[dramatic music]

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:18.728
MATT: Welcome back, as apparently Sam transformed
into his ultimate, final form.

00:09:18.728 --> 00:09:21.919
SAM: The King of Egos.

00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:26.488
MATT: How many is this?

00:09:26.488 --> 00:09:28.334
TALIESIN: It's Sams all the way down.

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:32.587
SAM: There are six pictures of me, plus me, so
that's seven. Lucky seven.

00:09:32.587 --> 00:09:47.519
MATT: Seven Sams, that's your name for the night.
Seventh Sam-urai. So folks. Not long--

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:52.448
SAM: Wait a second. You're doing a story? I
thought we were just going to kill each other!

00:09:52.448 --> 00:09:54.428
MATT: There's a narrative.

00:09:54.428 --> 00:09:56.277
TALIESIN: Let him paint his picture.

00:09:56.277 --> 00:09:58.645
LIAM: Have you met Matt?

00:09:58.645 --> 00:10:06.446
MATT: Not long before you finish your preparations
for the final battle with Vecna, you all spent an

00:10:06.446 --> 00:10:14.968
evening going to rest with unease and as sleep
took you, a vision fills your mind. Groggily you

00:10:14.968 --> 00:10:22.394
come to, wiping the insides of your eyelids,
trying to find some means of grasping the scenario

00:10:22.394 --> 00:10:32.045
around you. As unfamiliar smells of stale water
and crushed stone begin to fill your sinuses, the

00:10:32.045 --> 00:10:39.344
light blearing into your vision, you slowly focus
to look around you and find a strange assortment

00:10:39.344 --> 00:10:47.989
of structures in the vicinity. And there above
you, cracking through the clouds with a thunderous

00:10:47.989 --> 00:10:55.403
boom, you see a cloaked figure descend from the
heavens, hands held aloft, palms up to the sky as

00:10:55.403 --> 00:11:05.697
bolts of energy arc around its form. As it slowly
drifts, hovering above this central tower, the

00:11:05.697 --> 00:11:12.611
sconces of flame below burning with embers that
drift up with the wind and vanish. The cloaked

00:11:12.611 --> 00:11:20.360
figure spins around, revealing the face beneath
the hood, a well groomed, beautiful, familiar

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.760
beard and his perfectly combed hair.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.959
SAM: Oh, I feel better now.

00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:32.729
MATT: One side of his body contains unique armor
with a series of spines of metal seemingly

00:11:32.729 --> 00:11:35.218
protruding into his arm, as if to keep it in
place.

00:11:35.218 --> 00:11:38.208
(laughter)

00:11:38.208 --> 00:11:40.024
TRAVIS: Amazing.

00:11:40.024 --> 00:11:49.129
MATT: As he spins around, making eye contact with
the five of you members of Vox Machina, his voice

00:11:49.129 --> 00:11:58.411
billows out, "You've come again. And here you are,
and since you're here I think it's time that you

00:11:58.411 --> 00:12:06.775
"show me what you've got. Show me what you've got!"
With a thunderous clap he vanishes. You see a

00:12:06.775 --> 00:12:11.859
singular column of green energy left behind where
he stood, that now rests upon the top of the

00:12:11.859 --> 00:12:18.514
pillar. You watch as these two disparate towers on
two ends of the battlefield begin to slowly spin

00:12:18.514 --> 00:12:26.435
as energy crackles throughout them. You look
around the field for any sort of view of your

00:12:26.435 --> 00:12:31.473
opponents and all you see are your friends, and
you know in that moment that this is another

00:12:31.473 --> 00:12:39.261
challenge from the Great Colville, to show who
amongst you is most powerful.

00:12:39.261 --> 00:12:41.030
MARISHA: Not again.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.363
LIAM: But if we know that in advance.

00:12:43.363 --> 00:12:49.331
MATT: His voice cracks out from the heavens, "Roll
initiative."

00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:52.657
MARISHA: Wait, do we have time to precast?

00:12:52.657 --> 00:12:54.589
LIAM: No.

00:12:54.589 --> 00:12:55.844
MARISHA: To do like a little--

00:12:55.844 --> 00:12:57.817
LIAM: Take your precast and shove it in your ass,
Keyleth.

00:12:57.817 --> 00:13:00.344
SAM: Like you need something else.

00:13:00.344 --> 00:13:01.952
LIAM: You need an edge on us all?

00:13:01.952 --> 00:13:06.346
MARISHA: Yes, I do! It's not my fault that my
character's awesome.

00:13:06.346 --> 00:13:08.534
LIAM: Using my first luck of the day at the top.

00:13:08.534 --> 00:13:13.050
SAM: Can I inspire myself on this roll? I forget,
it's an ability check.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.402
MATT: It's an ability check, yeah.

00:13:14.402 --> 00:13:15.980
SAM: I will inspire myself.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.093
MARISHA: Can I give myself an inspiring leader
speech?

00:13:18.093 --> 00:13:19.252
MATT: No.

00:13:19.252 --> 00:13:22.742
LIAM: That's ten minutes.

00:13:22.742 --> 00:13:25.624
MARISHA: Come on, you got this, come on, come on.
You can do this, you can do this.

00:13:25.624 --> 00:13:32.834
LIAM: I'm one luck down.

00:13:32.834 --> 00:13:34.369
SAM: One inspiration down.

00:13:34.369 --> 00:13:36.770
MATT: I'm checking real fast here, hold onto your
numbers for a moment.

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:45.127
LIAM: In my luck box. One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven.

00:13:45.127 --> 00:13:46.630
SAM: Wait, wait, that's too many.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.544
(laughter)

00:13:49.544 --> 00:13:52.093
MATT: Which can include yourself.

00:13:52.093 --> 00:13:58.106
SAM: Shit, I forget what Mythcarver does.

00:13:58.106 --> 00:14:00.301
TRAVIS: You've used it twice!

00:14:00.301 --> 00:14:04.966
MATT: I'll put it this way, does everybody have
something they wish to prepare before the battle?

00:14:04.966 --> 00:14:09.976
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

00:14:09.976 --> 00:14:17.758
MATT: And as a note, whatever potions that you had
on yourself that are healing potions, are out of

00:14:17.758 --> 00:14:21.155
this battle, as you check your contents of your
pockets.

00:14:21.155 --> 00:14:27.912
TRAVIS: I mean, not really. I want to rage, that's
it.

00:14:27.912 --> 00:14:30.764
TALIESIN: The only thing I can think to do is I
would want to already have my Boots of Spider

00:14:30.764 --> 00:14:34.766
Climbing activated and my Diplomacy charged.

00:14:34.766 --> 00:14:38.614
MARISHA: How about, instead of a speech, can I
cast Freedom of Movement on myself?

00:14:38.614 --> 00:14:39.849
MATT: Sure.

00:14:39.849 --> 00:14:42.947
LIAM and MATT: Wings are already out.

00:14:42.947 --> 00:14:45.219
TRAVIS: Do you want to cast freedom of movement on
me?

00:14:45.219 --> 00:14:47.094
TALIESIN: We get to pose before the battle right?

00:14:47.094 --> 00:14:49.635
MARISHA: I think I'm the only one here, I don't
know, I can't.

00:14:49.635 --> 00:14:53.394
MATT: As you take in the gravity of the situation you
can see a small sparkle around you as a

00:14:53.394 --> 00:15:01.626
containment field marks the exterior of this
battlefield both around and roughly 80 to 100 feet

00:15:01.626 --> 00:15:03.889
in the air.

00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:05.334
TRAVIS: 80 to 100 feet?

00:15:05.334 --> 00:15:06.510
MATT: Yeah.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.832
TALIESIN: Find out the hard way.

00:15:07.832 --> 00:15:11.997
TRAVIS: I won't. I ain't going up there.

00:15:11.997 --> 00:15:14.911
MATT: Initiative orders. 25 to 20.

00:15:14.911 --> 00:15:17.549
SAM: (laughing) Everybody.

00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:19.006
TRAVIS: Oh, wow.

00:15:19.006 --> 00:15:20.197
SAM: Everybody but Kiki.

00:15:20.197 --> 00:15:21.347
SAM: 21!

00:15:21.347 --> 00:15:22.138
MARISHA: I rolled pretty good, too.

00:15:22.138 --> 00:15:23.392
TRAVIS: 20.

00:15:23.392 --> 00:15:24.593
TALIESIN: 24.

00:15:24.593 --> 00:15:34.288
MATT: All right, so we have currently Percy at 24,
Scanlan at 21, Grog at 20.

00:15:34.288 --> 00:15:39.623
LIAM: 19.

00:15:39.623 --> 00:15:42.338
MARISHA: Also 19.

00:15:42.338 --> 00:15:44.991
LIAM: Oh, fuck you. Give it to me. She doesn't
need it.

00:15:44.991 --> 00:15:49.182
MARISHA: Bullshit! Bullshit! Fucking Mr. Sneak
Attack!

00:15:49.182 --> 00:15:53.181
LIAM: (laughing) What are you talking about? You
are the clear winner of this game!

00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:55.728
MARISHA: Don't say that! I've lost all of them!

00:15:55.728 --> 00:16:01.548
MATT: I would like you both, right now, to roll a
dexterity check. Roll a d20, add your dexterity

00:16:01.548 --> 00:16:03.136
modifier.

00:16:03.136 --> 00:16:05.088
TALIESIN: He may have to burn another luck.

00:16:05.088 --> 00:16:06.508
LIAM: Nope.

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:07.984
MARISHA: Just my modifier, my straight modifier?

00:16:07.984 --> 00:16:11.659
MATT: Yep. Because technically you're on the same
initiative, but I can't have you doing your

00:16:11.659 --> 00:16:15.005
actions at the exact same time. This is to see
who's slightly faster.

00:16:15.005 --> 00:16:17.807
MARISHA: I rolled a 15, for 17 total.

00:16:17.807 --> 00:16:19.545
LIAM: 32, motherfucker.

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:22.055
SAM: Jesus! That's your wife!

00:16:22.055 --> 00:16:23.920
MATT: Wait. How'd you get 32?

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.399
LIAM: I rolled a 19, my dex is a 13.

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:29.838
MARISHA: That's your saving throw.

00:16:29.838 --> 00:16:31.580
MATT: That's your saving throw, it's a dexterity
check.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.426
LIAM: Still higher than you.

00:16:32.426 --> 00:16:33.640
MATT: Still higher.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.848
LIAM: 19. It's a saving throw?

00:16:37.848 --> 00:16:39.517
MATT: No, it's just an ability check.

00:16:39.517 --> 00:16:40.482
LIAM: Oh, okay.

00:16:40.482 --> 00:16:41.977
MATT: You're fine, you beat Keyleth.

00:16:41.977 --> 00:16:43.495
MARISHA: Learn your character sheet,
motherfucker!

00:16:43.495 --> 00:16:46.466
(laughing)

00:16:46.466 --> 00:16:53.898
MATT: So there is a burst of speed and Vax is ever
so faster than Keyleth. His dextrous capabilities

00:16:53.898 --> 00:16:58.630
edge her out of the initiative order, so Keyleth,
you're taking up the rear.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.466
MARISHA: I was so stoked about my 17.

00:17:00.466 --> 00:17:06.249
MATT: I know. With that, as those two towers are
currently crackling, Percival, it's your turn.

00:17:06.249 --> 00:17:08.363
TALIESIN: Wow, it's been a while.

00:17:08.363 --> 00:17:13.974
SAM: I don't know how to play this character
anymore. I've totally forgotten everything I can

00:17:13.974 --> 00:17:15.034
do.

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:17.186
MARISHA: This is the last time we're going to play
these characters.

00:17:17.186 --> 00:17:20.443
TALIESIN: I'm going to run into this room and I
want to see what's inside this building.

00:17:20.443 --> 00:17:31.223
MATT: All right. So you rush around. That's about
as far as you get with your movement. Looking

00:17:31.223 --> 00:17:41.292
inside, you see a large cluster of sigils carved
into the ground with crystals sticking out and

00:17:41.292 --> 00:17:46.548
it's this low pulsing purple energy. Make a
perception check, actually.

00:17:46.548 --> 00:17:47.860
TALIESIN: All right.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.744
LIAM: Castlevania teleport mode.

00:17:49.744 --> 00:17:54.797
TALIESIN: 23.

00:17:54.797 --> 00:18:00.997
MATT: 23. You notice a small groove of similar
pulsing kind of purplish-blue energy that runs

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:07.036
from the circle and out of the chamber, which is
this line here. And then you also barely see on

00:18:07.036 --> 00:18:13.795
the edge what appears to be an archway, a door
that is built that has a slight shifting barrier

00:18:13.795 --> 00:18:15.577
of mist where the archway is.

00:18:15.577 --> 00:18:18.530
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend the rest of my action
moving into the archway of mist.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.499
MATT: You move into the archway?

00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:21.336
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:18:21.336 --> 00:18:27.283
MATT: Okay, and with that you move here.

00:18:27.283 --> 00:18:30.742
TALIESIN: How much movement do I have left?

00:18:30.742 --> 00:18:35.199
MATT: That's where it puts you.

00:18:35.199 --> 00:18:37.841
TALIESIN: All right.

00:18:37.841 --> 00:18:42.030
MATT: And having revealed those two elements of
the battlefield. Going to leave those two open for

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:47.568
the time, but there is a roof up there about ten
feet tall. End of your turn?

00:18:47.568 --> 00:18:48.644
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

00:18:48.644 --> 00:18:50.353
MATT: Okay. Scanlan, you're up.

00:18:50.353 --> 00:18:51.837
TALIESIN: You don't see me.

00:18:51.837 --> 00:18:56.524
SAM: I'm going to turn invisible.

00:18:56.524 --> 00:19:00.116
MATT: Okay, you cast Invisibility on yourself.
That's your action.

00:19:00.116 --> 00:19:08.146
SAM: And I'm going to pick a direction to run in.
I don't see anybody. I'm going to pick a random

00:19:08.146 --> 00:19:13.193
direction. That's right. I'm going to run to the
right. Is this a door that I can get in?

00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:14.763
MATT: That is currently a door.

00:19:14.763 --> 00:19:16.161
SAM: Currently a door?

00:19:16.161 --> 00:19:17.395
MATT: Meaning it is a door.

00:19:17.395 --> 00:19:24.222
SAM: I'll run over that way. I only go 25 feet. Or
25 things.

00:19:24.222 --> 00:19:27.835
TALIESIN and MATT: 25.

00:19:27.835 --> 00:19:29.406
SAM: And bonus action I can't dash, right, no?

00:19:29.406 --> 00:19:32.065
MATT: No. You're not a rogue, buddy, no. Sorry.

00:19:32.065 --> 00:19:33.853
SAM: I don't know. I've never dashed!

00:19:33.853 --> 00:19:36.157
(laughter)

00:19:36.157 --> 00:19:39.207
MATT: However, you are currently considered
invisible.

00:19:39.207 --> 00:19:43.505
TALIESIN: Do you have a thingy for that? I have a
cake.

00:19:43.505 --> 00:19:51.408
MATT: It's been a few weeks since we played and I
left my markers at home. But that's okay. That

00:19:51.408 --> 00:19:56.655
cake means you're invisible. It's an invisibility
cake. All right, finishing Scanlan's turn. Grog,

00:19:56.655 --> 00:19:57.961
you're up.

00:19:57.961 --> 00:20:03.321
TRAVIS: Raging, can I run around the side of the
tower that's closest to you towards the door of

00:20:03.321 --> 00:20:05.172
this little Superman shaped-- yep.

00:20:05.172 --> 00:20:08.396
MATT: 30, you're at the door.

00:20:08.396 --> 00:20:13.317
TRAVIS: Can I use siege to knock the fucking door
open?

00:20:13.317 --> 00:20:15.462
MATT: Go ahead and make an attack against the
door.

00:20:15.462 --> 00:20:20.079
SAM: Are we hearing things? Can we hear the crack
of wood?

00:20:20.079 --> 00:20:21.843
TRAVIS: 20.

00:20:21.843 --> 00:20:27.872
MATT: 20, go ahead and roll damage. You now hear a
thunderous roar, Grog's voice billowing out from

00:20:27.872 --> 00:20:35.996
the air not too far from you across a moat-like
pond of clear water that surrounds the vicinity of

00:20:35.996 --> 00:20:41.411
the central tower. With a smashing sound, you see
wood splinter off into the air.

00:20:41.411 --> 00:20:44.019
TRAVIS: A d4 for the fit hands or with the axe?

00:20:44.019 --> 00:20:45.417
MATT: With the axe.

00:20:45.417 --> 00:20:53.136
TRAVIS: Oh, shit balls ass, sorry. Nope, that's a
ten. Eight plus--

00:20:53.136 --> 00:20:54.380
MATT: This is the Bloodaxe?

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.409
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:20:55.409 --> 00:20:56.517
MATT: Bloodaxe is a d12.

00:20:56.517 --> 00:20:58.391
TRAVIS: It is, right, I was using the sword before
that.

00:20:58.391 --> 00:20:59.977
MATT: Yeah, d12. What did you roll?

00:20:59.977 --> 00:21:10.020
TRAVIS: That's an eight on both of them, plus--
Sorry, been a hot minute. 23.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:14.579
MATT: 23, double eight? Yeah, the door is
destroyed. It's blown inside, the hinges kind of

00:21:14.579 --> 00:21:17.663
(squeaking sound) and what little bit of the door
still remains kind of breaks off and slams into

00:21:17.663 --> 00:21:26.378
the ground, and revealing the interior of this
chamber, the door now open. It is empty except for

00:21:26.378 --> 00:21:29.331
a singular chest sitting in the far corner from
you.

00:21:29.331 --> 00:21:33.531
TRAVIS: Do I have any movement left? What did I
end on, 40?

00:21:33.531 --> 00:21:35.488
MATT: That was 30, you still have 20 feet of
movement.

00:21:35.488 --> 00:21:37.151
TRAVIS: Can I make my way to the chest?

00:21:37.151 --> 00:21:39.078
MATT: Yes you can.

00:21:39.078 --> 00:21:41.920
TRAVIS: And it's not a bonus action to open said
chest, right?

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.126
MATT: Nope, that would be an action.

00:21:43.126 --> 00:21:44.162
TRAVIS: I'll stay in my room!

00:21:44.162 --> 00:21:44.965
MATT: Okay.

00:21:44.965 --> 00:21:46.313
TRAVIS: Can I shut the door-- the door's gone.

00:21:46.313 --> 00:21:48.053
(laughter)

00:21:48.053 --> 00:21:57.333
MATT: At this point, both of the towers-- the
sparking energy arcs outward and nobody's in the

00:21:57.333 --> 00:21:59.333
vicinity, so no worries there.

00:21:59.333 --> 00:22:00.952
SAM: Oh boy!

00:22:00.952 --> 00:22:05.545
MATT: You watch as energy sparks offward and hits
the other structures nearby and then eventually

00:22:05.545 --> 00:22:13.400
pulls back into the towers and the glow is slowly
building once more. Vax, you're up.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.095
LIAM: Okay, I am sending you something. I'm going
to use a bonus action to hide.

00:22:17.095 --> 00:22:19.730
MATT: Okay, roll a stealth check, please.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.717
LIAM: Sure. Nobody can see me, right?

00:22:21.717 --> 00:22:23.490
MATT: Not at the moment.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:27.978
LIAM: Okay, that is a 27.

00:22:27.978 --> 00:22:29.904
MATT: Okay.

00:22:29.904 --> 00:22:39.745
LIAM: Here it comes to you. And I've charted this
right, I think.

00:22:39.745 --> 00:22:42.200
MATT: You're on deck, Keyleth.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:47.856
SAM: Are we playing Battleship now? Are you
sending him moves? Is this what's happening?

00:22:47.856 --> 00:22:49.304
LIAM: Yes.

00:22:49.304 --> 00:22:58.205
MATT: Okay, Vax vanishes into the shadows of the
field. Let's see here.

00:22:58.205 --> 00:23:04.148
LIAM: Feel me?

00:23:04.148 --> 00:23:05.586
MATT: Yeah.

00:23:05.586 --> 00:23:07.726
LIAM: Okay.

00:23:07.726 --> 00:23:09.037
MATT: That your turn?

00:23:09.037 --> 00:23:14.453
LIAM: Oh, shite. Yes it is.

00:23:14.453 --> 00:23:17.473
MATT: Okay, ends Vax's turn, Keyleth, you're up.

00:23:17.473 --> 00:23:21.424
MARISHA: Hey, question, clarification on
blindsight?

00:23:21.424 --> 00:23:23.340
MATT: Yes?

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:30.512
MARISHA: I was going to look it up. You're blind
but you can still see through you being awesome?

00:23:30.512 --> 00:23:34.193
MATT: Is this in reference to a creature?

00:23:34.193 --> 00:23:35.451
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:23:35.451 --> 00:23:42.988
MATT: Blindsight means that they either don't use
their eyes to see and as such Blind doesn't affect

00:23:42.988 --> 00:23:44.046
them.

00:23:44.046 --> 00:23:45.635
TRAVIS: Oh, like the worms and stuff.

00:23:45.635 --> 00:23:50.373
MATT: Yeah. Creatures without eyes, such as
grimlocks, grey oozes, either it's naturally blind

00:23:50.373 --> 00:23:57.065
and can see without having to use the eyes or if
it's ever blinded it doesn't affect it.

00:23:57.065 --> 00:24:00.419
MARISHA: Okay, so I wouldn't be able to see
through Scanlan's Invisibility with blindsight.

00:24:00.419 --> 00:24:03.776
MATT: Not with blindsight, with tremor sense you
would still feel him running across.

00:24:03.776 --> 00:24:13.566
MARISHA: That's what I was getting clarification
on. I am going to cast Sunbeam at 6th level,

00:24:13.566 --> 00:24:15.870
and--

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:20.166
MATT: Where are you casting it?

00:24:20.166 --> 00:24:22.973
MARISHA: Sunbeam. Myself.

00:24:22.973 --> 00:24:24.818
MATT: Right. It creates a beam when you cast it.

00:24:24.818 --> 00:24:30.846
MARISHA: As an action I get to create a beam,
right?

00:24:30.846 --> 00:24:35.038
MATT: Correct, but when you initially cast it you
create a beam so if you want to fire at wherever

00:24:35.038 --> 00:24:36.598
and it's gone, that's fine.

00:24:36.598 --> 00:24:42.353
MARISHA: Okay. Well then, how about this? I want
to peek around this corner over here.

00:24:42.353 --> 00:24:46.895
SAM: My tremor sense hears her moving.

00:24:46.895 --> 00:24:49.117
MARISHA: Do I see Percy?

00:24:49.117 --> 00:24:51.914
MATT: Yeah, you very plainly see Percy.

00:24:51.914 --> 00:24:54.698
MARISHA: Okay, then I'm going to do Sunbeam.

00:24:54.698 --> 00:24:56.456
TALIESIN: That'll do.

00:24:56.456 --> 00:25:03.565
MATT: All right. First blood. Other than the door.
Which, to be fair, is the most Vox Machina opening

00:25:03.565 --> 00:25:06.114
thing to destroy.

00:25:06.114 --> 00:25:09.097
TRAVIS: This is for 115 episodes, you bitch!

00:25:09.097 --> 00:25:10.839
MARISHA: Did I destroy the door? Is that what
you're saying?

00:25:10.839 --> 00:25:12.565
MATT: No, Travis did earlier.

00:25:12.565 --> 00:25:14.311
TRAVIS: You didn't destroy everything!

00:25:14.311 --> 00:25:16.161
MARISHA: Sorry, I checked out.

00:25:16.161 --> 00:25:17.937
(laughter)

00:25:17.937 --> 00:25:22.566
MATT: All right, Percy, I need you to make a
constitution saving throw, please.

00:25:22.566 --> 00:25:24.988
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw. This is
magical, isn't it?

00:25:24.988 --> 00:25:26.072
MATT: Yes, it is.

00:25:26.072 --> 00:25:27.644
TALIESIN: So I get advantage on this.

00:25:27.644 --> 00:25:28.496
MATT: You do.

00:25:28.496 --> 00:25:29.992
MARISHA: Is that versus my spell level?

00:25:29.992 --> 00:25:31.230
MATT: Yep, your spell DC.

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:33.217
TALIESIN: What's your spell DC? Oh, okay,
constitution saving throw.

00:25:33.217 --> 00:25:34.453
MARISHA: It's pretty high.

00:25:34.453 --> 00:25:40.193
TALIESIN: 25.

00:25:40.193 --> 00:25:41.522
MATT: 25, I think that saves.

00:25:41.522 --> 00:25:44.371
MARISHA: That hits, so you are not blinded but you
do still take the damage.

00:25:44.371 --> 00:25:46.128
TALIESIN: How much damage?

00:25:46.128 --> 00:25:47.333
MATT: Half as much damage.

00:25:47.333 --> 00:26:06.332
MARISHA: Half as much. 6d8 radiant. (counting) 33
damage total.

00:26:06.332 --> 00:26:10.408
MATT: 33 damage. Half that. You take 16 points of
radiant damage.

00:26:10.408 --> 00:26:12.291
TALIESIN: I'll take 16 points of radiant damage.

00:26:12.291 --> 00:26:20.464
MARISHA: And then I use my bonus action to turn
into an earth elemental. I still have a little bit

00:26:20.464 --> 00:26:22.171
of movement, right?

00:26:22.171 --> 00:26:23.486
MATT: You do.

00:26:23.486 --> 00:26:27.923
MARISHA: I'm going to use the rest of my movement
to peek back around there.

00:26:27.923 --> 00:26:32.758
SAM: How big is that thing?

00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:34.776
MATT: It's considered a large creature.

00:26:34.776 --> 00:26:36.541
SAM: Is it taller than the roof?

00:26:36.541 --> 00:26:46.022
MATT: No. Because about ten feet tall, it's about
as tall as the roof. But you do see Keyleth come

00:26:46.022 --> 00:26:51.314
out of the side, blast a Sunbeam-- Your line of
sight over there, you barely see her rush around

00:26:51.314 --> 00:26:55.808
the corner, fire this beam of energy, and then
(whooshing) into an elemental and then curl around

00:26:55.808 --> 00:26:58.472
the way.

00:26:58.472 --> 00:26:59.921
SAM: Nice! Just going to crack my knuckles then.

00:26:59.921 --> 00:27:01.670
MATT: Ending Keyleth's turn, Percy you're up.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:08.346
TALIESIN: I'm going to hop right back through that
door, and take a right out that door and start

00:27:08.346 --> 00:27:16.033
heading back out that-- yeah, right there, and
then I'm going to use the rest of my-- to cast

00:27:16.033 --> 00:27:25.199
Silence. I'm casting my silence ball, I am now
completely quiet.

00:27:25.199 --> 00:27:27.197
SAM: Except for tremor sense.

00:27:27.197 --> 00:27:28.795
TRAVIS: Where'd he go?

00:27:28.795 --> 00:27:30.211
MATT: You don't know where he went.

00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:31.455
TRAVIS: Oh, he's off the map? Oh, there he is.

00:27:31.455 --> 00:27:32.641
(laughter)

00:27:32.641 --> 00:27:34.564
MATT: So Percy has Silence on him, Scanlan, you're
up.

00:27:34.564 --> 00:27:43.200
SAM: Okay. Shoot! I saw her. (to Marisha) I saw
you!

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.773
MARISHA: I saw you!

00:27:45.773 --> 00:27:53.365
SAM: Let's see here, 25 feet gets me to either
here or here, right?

00:27:53.365 --> 00:27:59.386
MATT: I mean, 25 would put you-- almost.

00:27:59.386 --> 00:28:02.035
SAM: But I can't get somewhere where I can see
her.

00:28:02.035 --> 00:28:05.711
MATT: Not at the moment, it doesn't look like. You
know where she went, but you don't see her.

00:28:05.711 --> 00:28:11.803
SAM: As I walk, I will try that door, see if it
opens. Does it open?

00:28:11.803 --> 00:28:14.054
MATT: You walk up to the door, and you're going to
try it?

00:28:14.054 --> 00:28:15.089
SAM: Yeah.

00:28:15.089 --> 00:28:16.145
MATT: No, it's locked.

00:28:16.145 --> 00:28:18.928
SAM: Then I'm going to keep going and get to
here.

00:28:18.928 --> 00:28:20.519
TALIESIN: That's as far as you can go.

00:28:20.519 --> 00:28:21.574
SAM: You said 20!

00:28:21.574 --> 00:28:22.685
MATT: 25.

00:28:22.685 --> 00:28:24.452
TALIESIN: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25. To the door.

00:28:24.452 --> 00:28:26.052
SAM: I thought you said I could get to either here
or here!

00:28:26.052 --> 00:28:29.391
MATT: Little gnome feet.

00:28:29.391 --> 00:28:44.154
SAM: Okay, I will use my action to cast Minor
Illusion and it's going to be Scanlan's voice

00:28:44.154 --> 00:28:49.891
coming from right here behind where she can't see,
singing a little song.

00:28:49.891 --> 00:28:52.277
MATT: Okay.

00:28:52.277 --> 00:28:57.764
SAM: Minor Illusion I don't think is
concentration, right? It just says one action.

00:28:57.764 --> 00:29:02.212
MATT: Do be aware--

00:29:02.212 --> 00:29:08.981
LIAM: Heads up guys, my only chance of surviving
to the halfway mark of this game--

00:29:08.981 --> 00:29:10.459
MATT: Invisibility ends when you cast a spell.

00:29:10.459 --> 00:29:11.692
SAM: Oh, when you cast any spell.

00:29:11.692 --> 00:29:12.509
MATT: Any spell.

00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:13.717
SAM: Ugh, shit, I always do this!

00:29:13.717 --> 00:29:14.883
MATT: I know.

00:29:14.883 --> 00:29:18.412
LIAM: My only chance of survival to the halfway
mark is hiding, so Matt and I will be doing a

00:29:18.412 --> 00:29:22.737
little bit of texting this evening so I can
telegraph my moves until somebody spots me.

00:29:22.737 --> 00:29:24.065
TRAVIS: Totally dick pics, right?

00:29:24.065 --> 00:29:26.989
LIAM: Yeah-- no! That's &lt;i&gt;crazy!&lt;/i&gt;

00:29:26.989 --> 00:29:29.005
MARISHA: Right under the table. Live dick pics.

00:29:29.005 --> 00:29:37.090
SAM: Then I will save my action until I see
someone, I guess.

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:39.695
MATT: What are you holding your action then?

00:29:39.695 --> 00:29:45.834
SAM: No! No, sorry Matt! Sorry! I'm new to this
game! I'm going to use my action to dash, right? I

00:29:45.834 --> 00:29:47.158
get more movement!

00:29:47.158 --> 00:29:47.961
MATT: Yeah.

00:29:47.961 --> 00:29:49.255
SAM: I go back here.

00:29:49.255 --> 00:29:53.812
TALIESIN: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25!

00:29:53.812 --> 00:29:55.674
SAM: Out of sight of her.

00:29:55.674 --> 00:29:57.118
MARISHA: Do I get any--

00:29:57.118 --> 00:30:00.358
MATT: Does your earth elemental have tremor sense?
Make a perception check.

00:30:00.358 --> 00:30:04.699
SAM: Yes, yes, it's all happening.

00:30:04.699 --> 00:30:06.680
MARISHA: 15 total.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.357
MATT: 15?

00:30:09.357 --> 00:30:14.555
MARISHA: No, 16. That makes a difference.

00:30:14.555 --> 00:30:16.173
SAM: Do I make a stealth check or something?

00:30:16.173 --> 00:30:20.325
MATT: No, because you went your full movement, so
yeah, no. She senses you.

00:30:20.325 --> 00:30:24.479
SAM: Okay. Does she have pinpoint accuracy or just
know the general direction?

00:30:24.479 --> 00:30:25.684
TRAVIS: She's made of earth.

00:30:25.684 --> 00:30:32.297
MATT: She has a pretty good idea. So you don't see
him and as you're looking around you sense the

00:30:32.297 --> 00:30:39.595
ground (footsteps). Something's there. Something
just moved behind that other building.

00:30:39.595 --> 00:30:50.440
MARISHA: Feels like about 45 pounds. Oh, sorry, 75
pounds. Four-foot five... That seems tall.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:54.457
TRAVIS: I don't have the deck, by the way. No
deck.

00:30:54.457 --> 00:30:55.869
TALIESIN: I would hope so.

00:30:55.869 --> 00:31:02.629
TRAVIS: Why? I mean, technically it's before the
Vecna fight but it didn't make the portal.

00:31:02.629 --> 00:31:05.865
MATT: From a story, it's before because I needed a
reason for Vax to still be there, but I wanted to

00:31:05.865 --> 00:31:11.296
make sure that everything was there. Yeah, tremor
sense, 60 feet. Yeah. All right, so that ends

00:31:11.296 --> 00:31:12.369
Scanlan's turn.

00:31:12.369 --> 00:31:13.444
SAM: She knows where I am?

00:31:13.444 --> 00:31:22.219
MATT: You don't know that. You're like, "Aw, I'm
so slick! Nobody knows where I am!" She's like--

00:31:22.219 --> 00:31:37.482
"There." All right, and finishing Scanlan's turn,
Grog. At this moment, the energy in those two

00:31:37.482 --> 00:31:43.931
circles begin to (vibrating). Percival, you glance
over the back of your shoulder and you see a burst

00:31:43.931 --> 00:31:47.968
of bluish-purple energy fill the entire chamber.

00:31:47.968 --> 00:31:52.837
MARISHA: The inside circles?

00:31:52.837 --> 00:32:02.175
MATT: Inside this entire room fills purple. It
washes past you. You feel warm but no damage,

00:32:02.175 --> 00:32:03.359
nothing.

00:32:03.359 --> 00:32:04.509
TRAVIS: Nothing?

00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:05.733
MARISHA: I don't trust that.

00:32:05.733 --> 00:32:10.190
TALIESIN: Can I say, Woo, that was close! Do I
hear myself?

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.130
MATT: Yes.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:13.592
TALIESIN: Damn it! Fuck!

00:32:13.592 --> 00:32:16.847
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Oh no!

00:32:16.847 --> 00:32:18.700
MATT: And that's all you saw.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.315
TALIESIN: Well, that makes life a little more
complicated.

00:32:22.315 --> 00:32:24.229
MATT: Grog, your turn.

00:32:24.229 --> 00:32:30.744
TRAVIS: All my spells. Can I open &lt;i&gt;le chest du
mysterie&lt;/i&gt;?

00:32:30.744 --> 00:32:36.347
MATT: You may. You use your action to open the
chest and reach inside. You get yourself a Potion

00:32:36.347 --> 00:32:37.834
of Superior Healing.

00:32:37.834 --> 00:32:46.153
TRAVIS: Yes, sweet. Great. I have my full
movement, right? Can I come out of the room and

00:32:46.153 --> 00:32:48.277
start making my way toward this area?

00:32:48.277 --> 00:32:57.935
MATT: Sure. 50 is about right here.

00:32:57.935 --> 00:33:00.596
TRAVIS: That sounds great. And this is a solid
column? There's no way in there?

00:33:00.596 --> 00:33:05.764
MATT: It is solid, but there's no roof on it. It's
an open cylinder, almost like a small cylindrical

00:33:05.764 --> 00:33:08.949
bunker. It's about six feet tall.

00:33:08.949 --> 00:33:10.950
TRAVIS: Okay, so you could--

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:14.833
MATT: Yeah, you could use it for cover or use it
to hide. The other ones, though, with the towers

00:33:14.833 --> 00:33:19.316
on top, are solid. Even though they have windows
there, imagine those have no entry. They're just a

00:33:19.316 --> 00:33:25.185
platform for the towers generating electricity.
Does that end your turn, Grog? All right, that

00:33:25.185 --> 00:33:27.267
brings us to Vax.

00:33:27.267 --> 00:33:33.262
LIAM: Well, you didn't-- I asked a very specific
question and I need an answer. Yeah. Before I can

00:33:33.262 --> 00:33:34.617
make a call.

00:33:34.617 --> 00:33:37.247
MATT: All right. There are stairs that spiral up.

00:33:37.247 --> 00:33:40.484
LIAM: Aw, great. Thanks.

00:33:40.627 --> 00:33:43.263
SAM: I've never seen someone so disappointed at
stairs before.

00:33:43.263 --> 00:33:45.391
MARISHA: We've got an idea of where he is.

00:33:45.391 --> 00:33:47.270
LIAM: Yeah, that's why I threw the phone down.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:51.792
MATT: I'm sorry. This works for a certain point
before I'm like, all right.

00:33:51.792 --> 00:33:56.207
LIAM: I know, I know. That's my magic power. Some
people turn into monsters, some people hide.

00:33:56.207 --> 00:34:00.211
SAM: Your magic power is your wit.

00:34:00.211 --> 00:34:03.233
LIAM: All right, hold on. I'm doing my fucking
move!

00:34:03.233 --> 00:34:08.475
TRAVIS: Wait a minute. If you die, do you come
back 30 minutes later, naked, out of the woods?

00:34:08.475 --> 00:34:11.199
MATT: 24 hours, yeah. But he still loses the
Battle Royale.

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:14.142
MARISHA: I was going to say, does he win the
battle? Just waits?

00:34:14.142 --> 00:34:19.572
TRAVIS: Walks out naked. Lord Colville is like, "I
am pleased."

00:34:19.572 --> 00:34:28.927
LIAM: Coming at you. Okay, that's what I'm doing.

00:34:28.927 --> 00:34:35.070
MATT: Okay, got you. All right, that ends Vax's
turn. Keyleth, you're up.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:47.195
MARISHA: Oh, shit. I want to go, hm. Bink, bink.
Oh hey, Scanlan! (laser noise)

00:34:47.195 --> 00:34:49.024
MATT: You're going to Sunbeam the gnome?

00:34:49.024 --> 00:34:50.511
MARISHA: I'm going to Sunbeam the gnome.

00:34:50.511 --> 00:34:52.976
MATT: Scanlan, as you're sitting there hiding--

00:34:52.976 --> 00:34:54.473
SAM: She cannot see me.

00:34:54.473 --> 00:34:59.519
MATT: This giant earth elemental comes around the
corner, that you know to be Keyleth, and looks in

00:34:59.519 --> 00:35:03.847
the general space you are and fires a beam in the
direction where you are. And it's wide

00:35:03.847 --> 00:35:09.037
enough to hit you. So you gather, in that brief
moment before you get completely enveloped by

00:35:09.037 --> 00:35:15.089
burning, radiant energy, "Oh shit, she knows where
I am." Make a constitution saving throw, please.

00:35:15.089 --> 00:35:16.517
SAM: Can I Counterspell that?

00:35:16.517 --> 00:35:17.656
MATT: Yeah you can.

00:35:17.656 --> 00:35:21.074
SAM: Okay, I will Counterspell that at level
four.

00:35:21.074 --> 00:35:24.338
MARISHA: Wait, but I've already cast it. It's a
concentration spell.

00:35:24.338 --> 00:35:25.899
MATT: That's true. No.

00:35:25.899 --> 00:35:26.894
SAM: It just happens?

00:35:26.894 --> 00:35:30.651
MATT: Yeah. You're right. Thank you for reminding
me of that. Yeah, make a constitution saving

00:35:30.651 --> 00:35:31.818
throw.

00:35:31.818 --> 00:35:37.789
SAM: Constitution saving throw! First blood. 22.

00:35:37.789 --> 00:35:41.835
MARISHA: Fuck! Yeah, you save against it.

00:35:41.835 --> 00:35:43.947
MATT: Okay, so you're not blinded.

00:35:43.947 --> 00:35:45.806
SAM: Great, that's good.

00:35:45.806 --> 00:35:50.613
MATT: And you take half damage.

00:35:50.613 --> 00:35:54.403
TALIESIN: But he becomes visible, right?

00:35:54.403 --> 00:36:00.705
MATT: No. Once we get the damage in, he has to
make a concentration check.

00:36:00.705 --> 00:36:05.719
MARISHA: 27 plus five, so 32.

00:36:05.719 --> 00:36:13.182
MATT: 32, so 16 points of radiant damage and I
need you to make a constitution saving throw, with

00:36:13.182 --> 00:36:14.470
advantage because you're a war caster.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:17.323
MARISHA: He already did. Oh no, wait. Oh,
concentration.

00:36:17.323 --> 00:36:20.163
SAM: Another 22.

00:36:20.163 --> 00:36:25.071
MATT: All right, you're fine. You maintain
concentration on Invisibility. All right.

00:36:25.071 --> 00:36:27.935
MARISHA: And I'm going to use the rest of my
movement to go--

00:36:27.935 --> 00:36:43.525
TALIESIN: I have lost two of my most powerful
weapons already in one round.

00:36:43.525 --> 00:36:47.424
MARISHA: I'll go there.

00:36:47.424 --> 00:36:55.372
TALIESIN: Damn. It's okay, but I've lost two of my
most powerful weapons already. Shit.

00:36:55.372 --> 00:36:56.561
MARISHA: What did you lose?

00:36:56.739 --> 00:36:58.767
TALIESIN: I lost my Spider Climbing and I lost my
Silence.

00:36:59.037 --> 00:37:04.386
MARISHA: Oh, your Spider Climbing is gone too?
That sucks.

00:37:04.386 --> 00:37:07.860
SAM: But your most powerful weapon is your wit,
just like Liam!

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:16.353
LIAM: I'm just trying to live to intermission.
Come on.

00:37:16.353 --> 00:37:24.544
MATT: So Keyleth, is that your turn? All right,
you moved around that way. Top of the round. Oh,

00:37:24.544 --> 00:37:26.159
you do have a bonus action still, yeah.

00:37:26.159 --> 00:37:28.042
MARISHA: No, I don't have anything to do. Never
mind.

00:37:28.042 --> 00:37:29.623
MATT: Percival, you're up.

00:37:29.623 --> 00:37:39.859
TALIESIN: Man, okay. I have 30 bits of movement.
I'm irritated. Can I make it to that door? No, I

00:37:39.859 --> 00:37:56.604
can't make it to the door in one round, can I. I'm
going to-- shit, this is awkward. I've seen what

00:37:56.604 --> 00:37:59.887
those things do already and I know they're about
to do it again.

00:37:59.887 --> 00:38:08.790
TRAVIS: The first time it was after me and the
second time it was right before me.

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:12.621
SAM: Why is this so stressful?! We already beat
the bad guy!

00:38:12.621 --> 00:38:16.721
MATT: But now you're beating the ultimate villain:
yourselves.

00:38:16.721 --> 00:38:39.875
TALIESIN: There is nothing good I can do. I'm
going to start making my way over here and try and

00:38:39.875 --> 00:38:43.956
make it to against, not quite to the door, but to
the wall.

00:38:43.956 --> 00:38:47.110
MATT: 30. You get to about there with your
movement.

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:48.698
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want to be one over.

00:38:48.698 --> 00:38:50.512
MATT: Yeah, so one over this way?

00:38:50.512 --> 00:38:53.827
TALIESIN: Because I know that thing's got a
radiant kick.

00:38:53.827 --> 00:38:58.206
MATT: Okay. All right, that's your movement.

00:38:58.206 --> 00:39:02.071
TALIESIN: And then for my action--

00:39:02.071 --> 00:39:07.206
MATT: You do, as you turn the corner, glance over
and you see a large earth elemental around the

00:39:07.206 --> 00:39:10.643
corner, stomping within visual range.

00:39:10.643 --> 00:39:15.870
TRAVIS: If you also want to see something pretty,
you look behind you, girl. I'm sitting over here

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:17.102
flexing.

00:39:17.102 --> 00:39:19.448
MATT: That's true, and you do see Grog across the
water that way.

00:39:19.448 --> 00:39:25.514
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to spend the rest of my
movement, then-- oh fuck, there is no good thing.

00:39:25.514 --> 00:39:27.124
That door is locked, I'm sure it is.

00:39:27.124 --> 00:39:28.966
MATT: Well that's 30 feet right there.

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:48.946
TALIESIN: Well I have an action still. Since I'm
here, I'm actually going to take a few potshots at

00:39:48.946 --> 00:39:50.287
Keyleth for fun.

00:39:50.287 --> 00:39:53.532
SAM: Yes you will! First blood!

00:39:53.532 --> 00:39:55.631
MATT: So you have four attacks.

00:39:55.631 --> 00:39:57.374
MARISHA: Are you going to say that every time
someone gets hit?

00:39:57.374 --> 00:39:58.831
SAM: Yes.

00:39:58.831 --> 00:40:00.235
MATT: Which weapon are you using?

00:40:00.235 --> 00:40:14.829
TALIESIN: I'm using Bad News because the distance.
First shot is-- I'm actually going to do a deadeye

00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:23.350
shot to gain advantage. Actually, that's not fun.
Yeah, deadeye to gain advantage. Here we go for

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:33.419
that. And that crits! So I'm going to use that
crit. I'm also going to drop all of Cabal's Ruin,

00:40:33.419 --> 00:40:35.992
the entire run of Cabal's Ruin into that.

00:40:35.992 --> 00:40:38.894
SAM: Oh, shit! All right, it's begun.

00:40:38.894 --> 00:40:41.310
MARISHA: Might want to save your shit, but all
right.

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:45.508
TALIESIN: Cabal's Ruin is best used early. He
knows why.

00:40:45.508 --> 00:40:51.363
LIAM: Sam, your face folded in the shirt is
terrifying. It's better flattened out, but with

00:40:51.363 --> 00:40:53.508
four folds in it? Terrible.

00:40:53.508 --> 00:40:57.040
TRAVIS: I like that right nipple coming through.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:05.474
TALIESIN: Actually, that's technically, those are
not d12s. These are d12s. I really should have

00:41:05.474 --> 00:41:11.151
four of these, but I'll do two and remember to-- I
have to double all these dice, so here we go. Time

00:41:11.151 --> 00:41:13.480
to be a real jerk.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:21.535
MATT: Well, Taliesin, here's the weird thing.
Cabal's Ruin currently has no effect.

00:41:21.535 --> 00:41:26.592
TRAVIS: Oh, you got fucking smoked by the purple
shit!

00:41:26.592 --> 00:41:28.266
TALIESIN: Would that have emptied it?

00:41:28.266 --> 00:41:32.201
MATT: It currently lays against you like a normal
cloak.

00:41:32.201 --> 00:41:35.199
SAM: You don't know. You don't know!

00:41:35.199 --> 00:41:39.040
MATT: But you still get the shot off so you can
roll damage on that.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.733
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

00:41:40.733 --> 00:41:45.046
LIAM: Yeah, I don't know. I'm in this building
over here.

00:41:45.046 --> 00:41:46.151
SAM: Oh, are you?

00:41:46.151 --> 00:41:47.315
LIAM: Yes.

00:41:47.315 --> 00:41:48.631
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine.

00:41:48.631 --> 00:41:56.259
TRAVIS: I need to keep living in those places. I
don't know what it does, though.

00:41:56.259 --> 00:41:58.828
TALIESIN: That's 27 points of damage.

00:41:58.828 --> 00:42:03.616
MATT: Piercing damage? Which, non-magical, you're
resistant to.

00:42:03.616 --> 00:42:07.080
TALIESIN: Whole theory of that was to throw Cabal
into that.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.600
MATT: So you would take 13 points of piercing
damage for the first hit.

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.190
TALIESIN: That is irritating.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:15.049
MATT: You still have three more attacks.

00:42:15.049 --> 00:42:18.452
TALIESIN: I'm going to use one of those attacks to
reload.

00:42:18.452 --> 00:42:20.450
TRAVIS: How many points, Keyleth?

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:21.808
MARISHA: 13.

00:42:21.808 --> 00:42:30.518
SAM: Ooh, first blood!

00:42:30.718 --> 00:42:34.650
MATT: You watch (gunshot). You see bits and pieces
of the outer-shelled armor of the earth elemental

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:37.519
fracture and spiral off. Minimal impact.

00:42:37.519 --> 00:42:41.678
TALIESIN: All right, and then I'm going to take
another shot and reload. This will be third and

00:42:41.678 --> 00:42:50.292
fourth attack, shot and reload. At Grog! Because
that was disappointing. And I'm going to do a

00:42:50.292 --> 00:42:54.195
push-back because I'm curious to see what happens
when he-- I think that'll almost get him to hit

00:42:54.195 --> 00:42:55.495
the edge.

00:42:55.495 --> 00:42:56.554
MATT: Okay.

00:42:56.554 --> 00:43:02.059
TALIESIN: So let's see what ten feet does to him.
Yeah. I'm just curious. You're near the edge,

00:43:02.059 --> 00:43:09.770
sorry. Nothing personal. That's 28 to hit.

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:12.833
MATT: I'm pretty sure that hits. Go ahead and roll
damage.

00:43:12.833 --> 00:43:20.803
TALIESIN: Oh, that's not bad at all. You're fine.
That's 15 points of damage and you move ten feet

00:43:20.803 --> 00:43:22.299
away from me.

00:43:22.299 --> 00:43:28.146
MATT: Okay, so as you take half that because
you're raging, you get pushed five, ten into the

00:43:28.146 --> 00:43:30.514
barrier. Make a constitution saving throw.

00:43:30.514 --> 00:43:39.404
TRAVIS: 30. 18 plus 12.

00:43:39.404 --> 00:43:47.298
MATT: Okay, so you succeed. So you take-- that was
a very balanced roll. Like, six, six, six! Two,

00:43:47.298 --> 00:43:58.993
two, one. 23 points of force damage, halved. 23
would be halved, so 11, and you do not get pushed.

00:43:58.993 --> 00:44:08.249
As it slaps you into it, it slams into your back
and you feel it forcing you away from it at a much

00:44:08.249 --> 00:44:13.771
harder rate than you were forced into it, but you
manage to hold firm on the ground and not get

00:44:13.771 --> 00:44:15.071
pushed forward.

00:44:15.071 --> 00:44:16.385
TRAVIS: Into the water?

00:44:16.385 --> 00:44:17.526
SAM: Or whatever that substance is.

00:44:17.526 --> 00:44:18.772
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:44:18.772 --> 00:44:26.118
MATT: All right. So that's your turn. Scanlan,
you're up.

00:44:26.118 --> 00:44:34.048
SAM: I'm up? Okay, knowing where she is with my
tremor sense and just having seen her walk through

00:44:34.048 --> 00:44:35.176
there--

00:44:35.176 --> 00:44:36.827
MATT: You watched her walk around.

00:44:36.827 --> 00:44:49.505
SAM: I'm going to peek around the corner and I'm
going to, even if it kills my Invisibility-- oh

00:44:49.505 --> 00:44:52.507
wait! First I'm going to bonus action heal myself.
Healing Word.

00:44:52.507 --> 00:44:57.237
MATT: Okay, this will break your Invisibility. So
level two?

00:44:57.237 --> 00:45:00.184
SAM: Level two, yeah. Why not.

00:45:00.184 --> 00:45:07.203
MATT: I just assume at this point. So 2d4 plus
six.

00:45:07.203 --> 00:45:17.187
SAM: Ooh, four and a four! Okay, that's 14. I'm
back up. For my action, I will start singing.

00:45:17.187 --> 00:45:27.531
(singing) If you want my body and you think I'm
sexy, baby then start to dance! (normal) And I

00:45:27.531 --> 00:45:34.620
will cast Irresistible Dance on her. Through the
Hand Cone, by the way.

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:47.166
MATT: So hearing Scanlan's song, Marisha, there is
no roll because it is irresistible. Your earth

00:45:47.166 --> 00:45:54.061
elemental form begins tapping a heavy stone foot.
(impacts) You start turning into your own version

00:45:54.061 --> 00:45:58.519
of STOMP, a one-elemental show. Slamming into the
ground to the beat, maintaining it although he

00:45:58.519 --> 00:46:06.971
stopped singing, you're feeling it. Hold on, let
me see here. Let me check one thing.

00:46:06.971 --> 00:46:12.327
SAM: I can't even find it in the book.

00:46:12.327 --> 00:46:14.298
MATT: Let me check one thing just to be sure
because she's an elemental and that may or may not

00:46:14.298 --> 00:46:16.323
have an impact on this.

00:46:16.323 --> 00:46:19.044
SAM: I can't find it in the book. Is it not in the
book?

00:46:19.044 --> 00:46:22.982
TALIESIN: Irresistible Dance. It might be in the
new book.

00:46:22.982 --> 00:46:35.451
MATT: All right, yes. So you are not immune to
charm, so you're fine. So you can't move.

00:46:35.451 --> 00:46:40.766
SAM: Oh, she can &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; move.

00:46:40.766 --> 00:46:49.849
MATT: That's true. So on your turn, you have to
use all your movement to dance without leaving

00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:54.242
your space. So you're unable to move from that
spot until you get rid of the spell.

00:46:54.242 --> 00:46:59.635
MARISHA: Can I do the Locomotion and do a
traveling dance?

00:46:59.635 --> 00:47:03.945
MATT: You can, as long as it's in that space. So
you can do a little box-slide into that five-foot

00:47:03.945 --> 00:47:05.792
square and you're fine.

00:47:05.792 --> 00:47:07.394
MARISHA: How long does this last?

00:47:07.394 --> 00:47:10.454
MATT: It lasts until you spend an action to try
and make a saving throw to resist it.

00:47:10.454 --> 00:47:13.187
MARISHA: I have to spend an action?

00:47:13.187 --> 00:47:15.597
MATT: Yeah. You also have disadvantage on
dexterity saving throws while this is happening.

00:47:15.597 --> 00:47:20.994
So you can't move. You still have your action and
you can still cast spells from it, but until you

00:47:20.994 --> 00:47:23.963
spend an action to try and make a saving throw--

00:47:23.963 --> 00:47:26.314
MARISHA: What kind of saving throw?

00:47:26.314 --> 00:47:30.839
MATT: This would be a wisdom saving throw.

00:47:30.839 --> 00:47:31.919
TRAVIS: What if someone hits her?

00:47:31.919 --> 00:47:34.862
MATT: Doesn't matter. So Scanlan--

00:47:34.862 --> 00:47:38.535
SAM: I'm going to use whatever movement I have to
hide again behind this little--

00:47:38.535 --> 00:47:44.547
MATT: Okay, that's about as far as you can get.
Okay, that ends your go? Top of the round. Grog,

00:47:44.547 --> 00:47:51.421
you're up. The torches at the base of the tower
begin to flare up and then (explosion). You watch

00:47:51.421 --> 00:47:59.661
as all the space around the outside of the tower
radiates with burning flame, affecting nobody. But

00:47:59.661 --> 00:48:05.873
you get the sense that there are elements to this
field you have to use to your advantage or avoid

00:48:05.873 --> 00:48:07.246
altogether.

00:48:07.246 --> 00:48:09.966
TRAVIS: Good to know. Fire death.

00:48:09.966 --> 00:48:14.029
MATT: Grog, as you see this flare burn around you
and then dissipate, it's your turn.

00:48:14.029 --> 00:48:20.408
TRAVIS: Oh God, I was like, what? I'm sorry! Can I
use my action and dash to run all the way over to

00:48:20.408 --> 00:48:30.494
this spot, please? Great. And that will--

00:48:30.494 --> 00:48:33.585
SAM: Where are you going? She's pinned down, dude!
We need you over here!

00:48:33.585 --> 00:48:36.089
TRAVIS: That will complete my turn.

00:48:36.089 --> 00:48:38.026
MATT: Vax, you're up.

00:48:38.026 --> 00:48:40.382
LIAM: All right, here it comes. Boop!

00:48:40.382 --> 00:48:45.626
MARISHA: Jesus. Such a fascinating game.

00:48:45.626 --> 00:48:52.798
LIAM: You guys are fucking dicks. I chose rogue.
This is what I can do! That's it! I don't have any

00:48:52.798 --> 00:48:57.164
other shit I can do! This is it. I am defensive!

00:48:57.164 --> 00:48:59.587
TRAVIS: You haven't even been touched yet.

00:48:59.587 --> 00:49:03.455
TALIESIN: All of us have taken a little.

00:49:03.455 --> 00:49:12.809
LIAM: Raven Queen take me. Okay.

00:49:12.809 --> 00:49:14.846
MATT: So that's what you see.

00:49:14.846 --> 00:49:16.893
MARISHA: Give it time, dude.

00:49:16.893 --> 00:49:18.239
MATT: You're on deck, Keyleth.

00:49:18.239 --> 00:49:21.521
LIAM: Good, good. Am I out of stuff?

00:49:21.521 --> 00:49:25.781
MATT: No, you still have your action.

00:49:25.781 --> 00:49:29.370
LIAM: Okay, this is real quick. I just have one
last note.

00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:40.694
MATT: Okay. Got it. All right. Keyleth, you're
up.

00:49:40.694 --> 00:49:44.211
MARISHA: Okay, I don't see anyone.

00:49:44.211 --> 00:49:47.896
MATT: Nope. Scanlan is making you dance and then
goes like, do-do-do! And disappears behind the

00:49:47.896 --> 00:49:49.105
pillars.

00:49:49.105 --> 00:49:52.397
MARISHA: In my, what is it called?

00:49:52.397 --> 00:49:54.345
MATT: Irresistible Dance.

00:49:54.345 --> 00:49:57.009
SAM: Otto's Irresistible Dance.

00:49:57.009 --> 00:50:04.098
MARISHA: In my Terran language I say, You fucking
asshole! And as I'm dancing I'm going to try and

00:50:04.098 --> 00:50:06.662
make my wisdom saving throw because I can't do
anything else.

00:50:06.662 --> 00:50:07.966
MATT: Go for it.

00:50:07.966 --> 00:50:19.326
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil! You totally fucked
me! No, wait! No, you kind of fucked me. What's

00:50:19.326 --> 00:50:21.930
seven plus 14? 21.

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:24.448
MATT: The DC is?

00:50:24.448 --> 00:50:26.646
SAM: 22.

00:50:26.646 --> 00:50:28.704
MATT: 22, you do not succeed.

00:50:28.704 --> 00:50:33.377
TRAVIS: You got high wisdom, yo!

00:50:33.377 --> 00:50:36.741
MATT: You're just grooving out!

00:50:36.741 --> 00:50:39.605
LIAM: Just stand there and hang out until three
hours of this game are up.

00:50:39.605 --> 00:50:45.583
MARISHA: Question. Because it's cast on my
elemental form, if I switch wild shapes, will it

00:50:45.583 --> 00:50:46.864
go away?

00:50:46.864 --> 00:50:49.485
MATT: Only one way to find out.

00:50:49.485 --> 00:50:57.767
MARISHA: Okay. I'll use my bonus action to turn
into a fire elemental.

00:50:57.767 --> 00:51:15.418
MATT: As your form shifts into that of a moving,
grooving fire elemental, you continue dancing in

00:51:15.418 --> 00:51:19.417
place. But now it's less STOMP and more really
smooth, soft rave dancing.

00:51:19.417 --> 00:51:25.076
LIAM: It's like at Burning Man.

00:51:25.076 --> 00:51:32.914
MATT: Essentially. That ends Keyleth's turn.
Percy, you're up. Percival, the cloak: the energy

00:51:32.914 --> 00:51:36.518
returns to it. You feel the boots solidify back in
place and no sound.

00:51:36.518 --> 00:51:41.502
TALIESIN: That will do. I'm going to run around to
the door.

00:51:41.502 --> 00:51:45.885
MARISHA: It only knocks it out for a round? Or for
when it's turned on?

00:51:45.885 --> 00:51:48.220
MATT: All magical items, all effects, it seems.

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:49.650
TALIESIN: I'm going to snap.

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:51.390
MATT: No sound.

00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:54.700
TALIESIN: All right. Is the door open or is the
door not open?

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:55.773
MATT: The door's closed.

00:51:55.773 --> 00:51:58.266
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Animus to open the
lock.

00:51:58.266 --> 00:52:00.053
MATT: Okay. Make an attack with it.

00:52:00.053 --> 00:52:08.711
TALIESIN: Don't fuck me, that's 29 to hit.

00:52:08.711 --> 00:52:10.379
MATT: Yeah, no, roll damage.

00:52:10.379 --> 00:52:18.115
TALIESIN: I assume the door cannot take psychic
damage.

00:52:18.115 --> 00:52:21.020
MATT: The door doesn't take psychic damage.

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.712
TRAVIS: Are you sure? You've got a big vendetta
against doors.

00:52:23.712 --> 00:52:25.645
TALIESIN: 17 damage to the lock.

00:52:25.645 --> 00:52:32.534
MATT: You fire, no sound. The door opens with a
creak, no sound. The chamber within reveals a

00:52:32.534 --> 00:52:36.556
chest in the corner.

00:52:36.556 --> 00:52:46.901
TALIESIN: I'm going to run in, shut the door. It's
going to be an action to open that chest, isn't

00:52:46.901 --> 00:52:50.337
it? Okay. I'm going to hide behind the door, so if
it opens.

00:52:50.337 --> 00:52:54.514
MATT: You hide off to this side, waiting.

00:52:54.514 --> 00:52:56.873
TALIESIN: I'm just being careful.

00:52:56.873 --> 00:53:11.217
MARISHA: I have a question. Would Freedom of
Movement negate the dance spell? It says, "For the

00:53:11.217 --> 00:53:14.429
"duration, the target is unaffected by difficult
terrain and spells and other magical effects can

00:53:14.429 --> 00:53:19.487
"neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the
target to be paralyzed or restrained."

00:53:19.487 --> 00:53:27.994
MATT: Technically, it's not reducing your
movement. You're just spending your turn dancing

00:53:27.994 --> 00:53:29.106
in place.

00:53:29.106 --> 00:53:30.633
MARISHA: Damn it!

00:53:30.633 --> 00:53:31.771
TRAVIS: That's amazing!

00:53:31.771 --> 00:53:37.047
MARISHA: I love this DJ!

00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:42.935
MATT: This spell is worded apparently to just
skirt around Freedom of Movement. You &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; move,

00:53:42.935 --> 00:53:46.938
you just don't want to. You're Flashdancing in
there!

00:53:46.938 --> 00:53:50.139
LIAM: Best fiery running man ever!

00:53:50.139 --> 00:53:54.024
MATT: That ends Percy's turn. Scanlan, you're up.

00:53:54.024 --> 00:54:04.804
SAM: I become an ancient brass dragon. True
Polymorph is not a concentration spell, right? It

00:54:04.804 --> 00:54:06.317
just happens.

00:54:06.317 --> 00:54:10.020
MATT: True Polymorph is concentration.

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:12.303
SAM: So she would stop dancing?

00:54:12.303 --> 00:54:13.600
MATT: Correct.

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.701
SAM: Then I'm not going to do that. Shit.

00:54:16.701 --> 00:54:18.801
MARISHA: You know what? I'll take that!

00:54:18.801 --> 00:54:22.574
TALIESIN: I'm not going to be a brass dragon! I'm
going to be me.

00:54:22.574 --> 00:54:24.522
MARISHA: Enjoy the show, Scanlan!

00:54:24.522 --> 00:54:27.580
SAM: Sorry, Matt, sorry.

00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:31.411
MATT: That's okay. The brass dragon figure goes
back on the table.

00:54:31.631 --> 00:54:34.736
SAM: You have an ancient brass dragon at the
ready?!

00:54:34.736 --> 00:54:36.622
TRAVIS: Of &lt;i&gt;course&lt;/i&gt; he does!

00:54:36.622 --> 00:54:40.878
TALIESIN: Have you seen his office? It's basically
brass dragons.

00:54:40.878 --> 00:54:44.749
MARISHA: Technically my office, so it's an even
stronger statement.

00:54:44.749 --> 00:54:50.499
MATT: Sorry. It's getting better! No, it's not.

00:54:50.499 --> 00:54:57.201
SAM: Well, in that case, I will-- poo.

00:54:57.201 --> 00:55:00.450
MATT: Do you shake it out of your pant leg?

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:03.366
LIAM: Rabbit pellets.

00:55:03.366 --> 00:55:13.362
SAM: I want to roast her! She's pinned down, man!
We got her right now, guys, this is it!

00:55:13.362 --> 00:55:15.186
TALIESIN: We can't hear you.

00:55:15.186 --> 00:55:18.793
MATT: You do all have the earrings in!

00:55:18.793 --> 00:55:20.529
TALIESIN: But I certainly can't hear him.

00:55:20.529 --> 00:55:22.467
TRAVIS: Oh, we do have the earrings in?

00:55:22.467 --> 00:55:24.707
MATT: Yeah, you've got everything you have.

00:55:24.707 --> 00:55:26.253
TRAVIS: Oh we can talk shit while we play?!

00:55:26.253 --> 00:55:27.480
MATT: Yeah, you can!

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:28.801
TALIESIN: I can't hear anything you say.

00:55:28.801 --> 00:55:30.939
TRAVIS: I'm going to teabag you when you're dead.

00:55:30.939 --> 00:55:38.313
MATT: Scanlan, what you got? Grog, you're on
deck.

00:55:38.456 --> 00:55:44.433
SAM: I will say, though the earrings, She's open,
let's kill her. Trust me, I won't kill you if you

00:55:44.433 --> 00:55:47.137
get close.

00:55:47.137 --> 00:55:52.597
LIAM: "That's the thing, though, guys, I'm a
really good liar."

00:55:52.597 --> 00:55:58.120
SAM: I'll lean out and Lightning Bolt her.

00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.332
MATT: Go for it.

00:56:00.332 --> 00:56:02.072
LIAM: Is this out of the dick?

00:56:02.072 --> 00:56:10.875
SAM: Of course. No, I'm sensitive to the plight of
women. I will do it in a gentle bow.

00:56:11.011 --> 00:56:16.673
MARISHA: You just m'lady lightning struck me?

00:56:16.673 --> 00:56:18.348
LIAM: Tip of the hat.

00:56:18.348 --> 00:56:27.249
MATT: M'lightning bolt. It is the m'lightning
bolt.

00:56:27.249 --> 00:56:31.721
(laughter)

00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:39.357
MATT: And thus, a class begins to percolate in my
head. Scanlan, 8d6.

00:56:39.357 --> 00:56:42.110
LIAM: We peaked at the 35 minute mark.

00:56:42.110 --> 00:56:44.716
MATT: The Bardic School of White Knighting.

00:56:44.716 --> 00:56:58.038
LIAM: The m'lightning bolt. Artists, I've never
asked for anything specific. But now.

00:56:58.038 --> 00:56:59.369
SAM: 26.

00:56:59.369 --> 00:57:02.028
MATT: I need you to roll a dexterity saving throw
with disadvantage because you're dancing.

00:57:02.028 --> 00:57:13.004
MARISHA: This is so great. No, that was a natural
one. So I take it. How much was it?

00:57:13.004 --> 00:57:16.852
MATT: 26 points of lightning damage to your fiery
form.

00:57:16.852 --> 00:57:25.318
SAM: Do elementals maintain their damage level? If
she goes back to stone, does it halve the damage

00:57:25.318 --> 00:57:26.690
that it had?

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:27.907
MATT: No.

00:57:27.907 --> 00:57:29.257
SAM: Damn!

00:57:29.257 --> 00:57:33.902
LIAM: Get it out of your head that you're going to
win. Just have fun on the ride.

00:57:33.902 --> 00:57:37.771
SAM: If we're all over here, we can do it!

00:57:37.771 --> 00:57:42.454
TALIESIN: It's like a rollercoaster where you know
that they haven't finished the last ten feet of

00:57:42.454 --> 00:57:43.541
track.

00:57:43.541 --> 00:57:46.025
TRAVIS: He's just going to come out from wherever
he is and help you right now.

00:57:46.025 --> 00:57:48.002
SAM: She's there, man!

00:57:48.002 --> 00:57:51.429
LIAM: You all are going to die, and I'm going to
come out and embrace my girlfriend and let her

00:57:51.429 --> 00:57:53.786
kill me. That's how this game is going to go.

00:57:53.786 --> 00:57:55.301
MARISHA: You would do that for me?

00:57:55.301 --> 00:57:57.450
LIAM: Let her think that.

00:57:57.450 --> 00:57:59.317
(laughter)

00:57:59.317 --> 00:58:01.109
MARISHA: That's true love, right there.

00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:02.493
SAM: I'm going to turn back behind there.

00:58:02.493 --> 00:58:11.077
MATT: You're just boop! Okay, that ends your turn.
Top of the round. Grog, as you are coming around

00:58:11.077 --> 00:58:18.494
the way, you see a familiar sparking of lightning
energy as the two lightning towers blast off a

00:58:18.494 --> 00:58:25.743
radius of lightning energy. But no one's in the
radius to be affected by it. That brings it to

00:58:25.743 --> 00:58:26.974
your turn.

00:58:26.974 --> 00:58:29.603
TRAVIS: I would like to smash the door with my
bloodaxe.

00:58:29.603 --> 00:58:31.097
MATT: Make an attack.

00:58:31.097 --> 00:58:34.115
TRAVIS: Yeah, either one of those.

00:58:34.115 --> 00:58:41.933
SAM: In the distance, do we hear another door
breaking?

00:58:41.933 --> 00:58:43.559
TRAVIS: 21 points of damage.

00:58:43.559 --> 00:58:46.723
MATT: You do. Another heavy hit right after the
bolt of lighting dissipates over the horizon, you

00:58:46.723 --> 00:58:52.622
see splintered woods as an axe swings over the
range of the nearby roof of that building. You

00:58:52.622 --> 00:58:58.903
hear an angry goliath yell as the door is
sundered, opening to the chamber within.

00:58:58.903 --> 00:59:07.002
TRAVIS: May I entrez-vous, please? I will end my
turn.

00:59:07.142 --> 00:59:09.661
MATT: All right. Vax.

00:59:09.661 --> 00:59:16.031
LIAM: Coming at you. It's so good. I'm going to
win on this move. Okay.

00:59:16.031 --> 00:59:19.341
TRAVIS: I'm going to mime it.

00:59:19.341 --> 00:59:26.951
SAM: I'm single-handedly first blood-ing over
here! I'm first blood-ing everybody!

00:59:26.951 --> 00:59:30.904
MATT: Scanlan is playing the exact opposite as he
did as Taryon in the last one!

00:59:30.904 --> 00:59:32.595
SAM: Yep!

00:59:32.595 --> 00:59:38.580
MARISHA: Switching masks.

00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:40.312
TRAVIS: Are you writing a paragraph?

00:59:40.312 --> 00:59:41.746
LIAM: A short one.

00:59:41.746 --> 00:59:45.187
SAM: Dear Matt, check this box if you like me.

00:59:45.187 --> 00:59:48.303
MATT: Okay, so that ends your turn. Keyleth,
you're up.

00:59:48.303 --> 00:59:55.161
MARISHA: Give me this shit! I want to save from
it! Natural 20!

00:59:55.161 --> 00:59:58.414
MATT: And with that, you have your movement back.

00:59:58.414 --> 01:00:01.075
SAM: Oh no.

01:00:01.075 --> 01:00:03.512
MARISHA: (grunting)

01:00:03.512 --> 01:00:06.255
TALIESIN: You still have movement and a bonus
action.

01:00:06.255 --> 01:00:07.855
MATT: Yep.

01:00:07.855 --> 01:00:10.777
MARISHA: Bink! Do I see Scanlan?

01:00:10.777 --> 01:00:12.345
MATT: You do.

01:00:12.345 --> 01:00:13.651
MARISHA: (laser noise)

01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:16.938
LIAM: Did you just make that noise?

01:00:16.938 --> 01:00:18.083
SAM: Yeah, what's that noise?

01:00:18.083 --> 01:00:19.951
MARISHA: Sorry. Sunbeam!

01:00:19.951 --> 01:00:24.527
MATT: No, you don't have another action because
you used your action to resist the spell.

01:00:24.527 --> 01:00:28.192
MARISHA: Oh! I have a bonus though. I will use my
bonus to go back to earth elemental.

01:00:28.192 --> 01:00:35.576
MATT: Which, previously, Keyleth had two elemental
forms before she had to make a short rest.

01:00:35.576 --> 01:00:39.101
20th-level Keyleth has just transformed into her
third form.

01:00:39.101 --> 01:00:42.567
LIAM: Zero fucks.

01:00:42.567 --> 01:00:46.019
TRAVIS: Does that mean she can go earth elemental
again, or is that it?

01:00:46.019 --> 01:00:53.919
MATT: At full health. You get the sense now, and
you've heard of such rumors in your research as a

01:00:53.919 --> 01:01:00.357
bard, that certain powerful archdruids can wild
shape as many times as they want.

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:08.258
MARISHA: This is open, right? Can I do a big old
jump into it? I do that.

01:01:08.258 --> 01:01:10.320
LIAM: Sphere of Annihilation!

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.185
MATT: All right, that's your turn.

01:01:12.185 --> 01:01:17.903
MARISHA: Don't fuck with me like that! I took you
seriously for a good two seconds!

01:01:17.903 --> 01:01:20.231
TRAVIS: One little marble you didn't see.

01:01:20.231 --> 01:01:22.548
LIAM: That's the biggest disappointment you have
tonight. You did all right.

01:01:22.548 --> 01:01:24.538
SAM: Are there doors on that thing?

01:01:24.538 --> 01:01:30.402
MATT: Percy, you're up. No, it's a solid wall
about six feet tall, which you can see Keyleth

01:01:30.402 --> 01:01:32.113
peeking over the top a little bit.

01:01:32.113 --> 01:01:33.851
TALIESIN: So I'm going to open that chest.

01:01:33.851 --> 01:01:37.211
MATT: All right, you open the chest and you
acquire a potion of superior healing.

01:01:37.211 --> 01:01:43.698
TALIESIN: Thank you. And that's how many feet?
That's like five. So I can now, I have a little

01:01:43.698 --> 01:01:51.724
bit of movement to leave. Ten, 15, 20. So I can at
least use 20 to get to that corner there. Yeah,

01:01:51.724 --> 01:01:58.839
toward me. There, just there. Do I see Scanlan or
is he still invisible?

01:01:58.839 --> 01:02:00.882
MATT: No, he's not invisible anymore. You see
him.

01:02:00.882 --> 01:02:06.178
TALIESIN: Oh, so I see him right there? I still
have ten feet of movement after that. Cool. I am

01:02:06.178 --> 01:02:07.689
going to shoot Scanlan.

01:02:07.689 --> 01:02:09.236
SAM: Nice.

01:02:09.236 --> 01:02:22.798
TALIESIN: I'm going to shoot Scanlan. Let's use
Bad News for-- actually, let's use, oh this'll be

01:02:22.798 --> 01:02:32.050
fun. Let's do Animus, sharpshooter, and deadeye,
just for fun. Animus, sharpshooter, deadeye.

01:02:32.050 --> 01:02:34.824
SAM: I will Cutting Words this first shot.

01:02:34.824 --> 01:02:36.105
MATT: Okay.

01:02:36.105 --> 01:02:37.977
TALIESIN: I can't hear him.

01:02:37.977 --> 01:02:43.471
MATT: Well, and you're further than 60 feet from
him, I think, actually. Yeah, so it wouldn't

01:02:43.471 --> 01:02:44.763
work.

01:02:44.763 --> 01:02:56.766
TALIESIN: Animus, sharpshooter, dead shot. Oh,
you're so lucky that didn't crit. 28 to hit.

01:02:56.766 --> 01:02:58.772
MATT: 28 to hit.

01:02:58.772 --> 01:03:13.581
TALIESIN: That's 1d10 plus 1d6 psychic, plus I'm
going to-- eh, not on this one. This is shot

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:21.664
number one. So that's, oh, that's terrible. I'm
glad I did not. That's nine points of damage plus

01:03:21.664 --> 01:03:24.162
one point of psychic, so that's ten points of
damage.

01:03:24.162 --> 01:03:25.956
SAM: Are you adding these up? Because I'm not.

01:03:25.956 --> 01:03:27.566
MATT: You take ten points of damage.

01:03:27.566 --> 01:03:29.621
TALIESIN: For your next shot--

01:03:29.621 --> 01:03:32.933
MATT: You don't hear anything. All of a sudden--

01:03:32.933 --> 01:03:36.640
TALIESIN: You take 20 points of damage because
that was sharpshooter. 20, excuse me.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:40.439
MATT: So you take 20 points of damage and the
(impact and grunting). And you glance over your

01:03:40.439 --> 01:03:45.324
shoulder and you can see across the way, there's
Percival, gun up, but you've heard no gunfire.

01:03:45.324 --> 01:03:53.569
TALIESIN: Next shot. Same thing. Also didn't crit.
You're very lucky. That also hits. That's 29 to

01:03:53.569 --> 01:04:05.850
hit and then the same thing, 1d10 plus 1d6 plus
18. 26 points of damage.

01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:07.592
MATT: 26 points of damage.

01:04:07.592 --> 01:04:15.211
TALIESIN: And I'll do the same thing one more
time.

01:04:15.211 --> 01:04:19.779
SAM: I'm the wrong target!

01:04:19.779 --> 01:04:24.808
TALIESIN: Natural 20! You've just been critted.
And I'm going to drop all of Cabal's Ruin into

01:04:24.808 --> 01:04:47.043
this as well. So that's (counting) 40 points of
damage and now the 10d6 lightning damage. Does

01:04:47.043 --> 01:04:48.638
that get doubled or does that stay normal?

01:04:48.638 --> 01:04:50.224
MATT: Lightning damage also gets doubled.

01:04:50.224 --> 01:04:55.271
MARISHA: Oh, those were good rolls, too!

01:04:55.271 --> 01:05:03.792
TALIESIN: Plus 33 lightning damage on top of
that.

01:05:03.792 --> 01:05:07.036
MATT: 33 is doubled, so 66 points.

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:08.629
TALIESIN: 66 lightning damage on top of that.

01:05:08.629 --> 01:05:12.381
SAM: On top of what? I'm not adding your shit.

01:05:12.381 --> 01:05:14.088
TALIESIN: 41 plus 66.

01:05:14.088 --> 01:05:16.288
SAM: How is it 41? It was 40 before.

01:05:16.288 --> 01:05:18.131
TALIESIN: Was it 40? 40 plus 66.

01:05:18.131 --> 01:05:20.344
MATT: So 106 points of damage from that shot.

01:05:20.344 --> 01:05:28.389
TALIESIN: 106 points of damage on that shot. Oh, I
get my grit back on that, so that's nice. Ten.

01:05:28.389 --> 01:05:32.933
Cabal's empty. And for my final shot, (evil
laughter).

01:05:32.933 --> 01:05:39.379
TRAVIS: You know we kind of need Scanlan to take
down Keyleth, right?

01:05:39.379 --> 01:05:41.622
SAM: It's all good. This is how he wants to play
it.

01:05:41.622 --> 01:05:45.039
MARISHA: Come on, believe in yourself, man.

01:05:45.039 --> 01:05:48.223
SAM: Taliesin's been trying to do this for
months.

01:05:48.223 --> 01:05:51.736
TRAVIS: Don't make Taliesin get up at 5:30
anymore. It's not good for anyone.

01:05:51.736 --> 01:05:55.220
LIAM: This might push you toward chaotic good.

01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:58.677
TALIESIN: For my final shot, I'm going to reload
and hide.

01:05:58.677 --> 01:06:02.078
MATT: Okay. You reload.

01:06:02.078 --> 01:06:04.703
LIAM: Full action to hide?

01:06:04.703 --> 01:06:09.102
MATT: Well, he's not actually using a hide action.
He just goes into a chamber.

01:06:09.102 --> 01:06:14.988
TALIESIN: It's going to take him so long to get to
me. And if I get within ten feet of him, there's

01:06:14.988 --> 01:06:16.854
nothing he can do.

01:06:16.854 --> 01:06:24.074
MATT: So Percival, that's the end of your turn?
Scanlan, you're up. You watched this earth

01:06:24.074 --> 01:06:31.369
elemental dive into the tower right next to you in
this open space. You get shot the fuck up. You're

01:06:31.369 --> 01:06:37.765
covered in your own blood and you watch Percival
in the distance slink out of sight. And you're

01:06:37.765 --> 01:06:39.826
hurting bad.

01:06:39.826 --> 01:06:48.774
SAM: Yeah, I am. Mm, don't have lots of good
options. Oh boy.

01:06:48.774 --> 01:06:51.408
TALIESIN: I beat him up for you.

01:06:51.408 --> 01:06:54.040
MARISHA: You did. Very much so.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:58.014
TALIESIN: So you're either going to kill him next
round or he's going to do it to you.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:06.463
SAM: Bonus action, 2nd-level Healing Word. Uh-huh,
got to get back in the game.

01:07:06.463 --> 01:07:08.663
TALIESIN: Roll that d4.

01:07:08.663 --> 01:07:11.623
SAM: Five plus six, 11 points. Yeah.

01:07:11.623 --> 01:07:17.140
MATT: There you go. Heal up 11 points of damage.
Hey, it all adds up.

01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:19.804
TALIESIN: I'll make it go away again.

01:07:19.804 --> 01:07:22.219
SAM: Let's see here. What to do?

01:07:22.219 --> 01:07:24.806
TALIESIN: That was so pleasing.

01:07:24.806 --> 01:07:29.126
TRAVIS: 106 points!

01:07:29.126 --> 01:07:30.711
TALIESIN: One shot! I did &lt;i&gt;three&lt;/i&gt; shots.

01:07:30.711 --> 01:07:37.958
MATT: I'll keep this on deck just in case. Ancient
brass dragon. Just chilling on the side. You're on

01:07:37.958 --> 01:07:44.889
deck, Grog.

01:07:44.889 --> 01:07:50.175
TRAVIS: I'm texting you my turn.

01:07:50.175 --> 01:07:54.121
MARISHA: Who's on deck? You are?

01:07:54.121 --> 01:08:05.387
SAM: I need some healing. So. Shit. I've got to
get away from Keyleth. I've got to get healed.

01:08:05.387 --> 01:08:09.019
MARISHA: No, stay. Hang out.

01:08:09.019 --> 01:08:13.358
SAM: I will Dimension Door to the opposite
circular tower.

01:08:13.358 --> 01:08:16.045
MATT: The opposite circular tower?

01:08:16.045 --> 01:08:17.794
SAM: Yes, behind it.

01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:27.029
MATT: All righty. Hand me the piece? All righty.
That's your action.

01:08:27.029 --> 01:08:30.098
SAM: That's my action. That's it.

01:08:30.098 --> 01:08:41.529
MATT: Grog. At the top of your turn, actually,
nothing happens because none of you-- all of you

01:08:41.529 --> 01:08:44.608
are not able to see anything happen. Grog, it's
your turn.

01:08:44.608 --> 01:08:46.669
TRAVIS: I would like to open the chest.

01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:50.715
MATT: You pull it open. Potion of Superior
Healing.

01:08:50.715 --> 01:08:52.287
TRAVIS: Hey, look at that.

01:08:52.287 --> 01:08:54.375
MATT: I also want you to make a constitution
saving throw.

01:08:54.375 --> 01:09:00.069
TRAVIS: 19.

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:16.137
MATT: 19? Wasn't a great roll. You take 20 points
of poison damage. Halved, because of your belt.

01:09:16.137 --> 01:09:19.622
TRAVIS: Oh, I do have resistance because of the
belt! Yes, thank you. So ten.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:22.485
MATT: And you are currently poisoned.

01:09:22.485 --> 01:09:27.041
TRAVIS: Damn, son! From what, homie?

01:09:27.041 --> 01:09:34.246
MATT: As you open the chest, this dark
black-purple smoke billows out as you grab and

01:09:34.246 --> 01:09:40.374
pull the potion out of it. Almost like a trigger
or something. It fills your nose, your lungs.

01:09:40.374 --> 01:09:46.150
You're coughing and it seizes the inside of your
chest. And so you are currently poisoned.

01:09:46.150 --> 01:09:54.339
TRAVIS: Cool. Can I use my movement to run out and
toward this hallway? See how far I get.

01:09:54.339 --> 01:10:03.200
MATT: You can get right inside, if you want.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.253
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll stay just outside of it.

01:10:06.253 --> 01:10:09.254
MATT: Okay, you're hanging right there, just on
the outskirts.

01:10:09.254 --> 01:10:11.888
SAM: Do I see him?

01:10:11.888 --> 01:10:15.864
TRAVIS: Yeah, I see you! Hey, Scanlan.

01:10:15.864 --> 01:10:17.898
SAM: Does he see me?

01:10:17.898 --> 01:10:22.113
MATT: No, because you were hiding behind the side
and he rushed right to the hallway.

01:10:22.113 --> 01:10:24.458
TRAVIS: He's right behind me.

01:10:24.458 --> 01:10:32.541
MATT: I'll say because you weren't hiding and as
part of the battlefield here, glancing about, he

01:10:32.541 --> 01:10:34.533
does see you because you do not have a hide
action.

01:10:34.533 --> 01:10:35.693
SAM: Okay.

01:10:35.693 --> 01:10:37.647
TRAVIS: To be clear, I see you, and then I turn my
back on you.

01:10:37.647 --> 01:10:39.414
SAM: Like a matador?

01:10:39.414 --> 01:10:41.947
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm not focused on you right now.

01:10:41.947 --> 01:10:43.813
TALIESIN: He's not mad at a door.

01:10:43.813 --> 01:10:46.096
TRAVIS: I mean I can look at you if you want me
to.

01:10:46.096 --> 01:10:48.254
MATT: Ends Grog's turn.

01:10:48.254 --> 01:10:52.296
LIAM: It's already sent.

01:10:52.296 --> 01:10:53.400
TALIESIN: That's awful.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.185
MARISHA: That's pretty bad, man. That's real bad.

01:10:55.185 --> 01:10:57.272
TALIESIN: I don't feel like a good person
anymore.

01:10:57.272 --> 01:11:05.523
LIAM: Does that make sense?

01:11:05.523 --> 01:11:08.650
SAM: Pawn to rook four.

01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:11.189
TALIESIN: What? Yahtzee?

01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:15.483
SAM: Woodchuck to gray squirrel, woodchuck to gray
squirrel.

01:11:15.483 --> 01:11:21.222
MATT: All right, I see what you're doing. That's
your turn. Keyleth.

01:11:21.222 --> 01:11:24.260
MARISHA: Do I feel anything around me?

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:28.675
MATT: Currently? What's the tremor sense?

01:11:28.675 --> 01:11:30.002
MARISHA: 60 feet.

01:11:30.002 --> 01:11:33.340
MATT: 60 feet? No movement. At all.

01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:35.820
TALIESIN: Even the tower? 60 feet?

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:36.767
MATT: Yeah.

01:11:36.767 --> 01:11:38.645
TALIESIN: All right.

01:11:38.645 --> 01:11:42.606
MARISHA: Okay.

01:11:42.606 --> 01:11:48.426
SAM: Five master D&amp;amp;D players!

01:11:48.426 --> 01:11:52.417
MARISHA: And no one's been in here, right? You
tried to go in there and then failed?

01:11:52.417 --> 01:11:58.229
SAM: I tried the doorknob. I didn't really give it
all the effort.

01:11:58.229 --> 01:12:04.241
MARISHA: I'm going to go (roars) and then use my
siege abilities to just beat down the wall.

01:12:04.241 --> 01:12:16.074
MARISHA: First one is 20 total. No, I'm sorry, 22
total.

01:12:16.074 --> 01:12:20.926
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Roll damage and then double
it. Percy, you're on deck.

01:12:20.926 --> 01:12:27.447
MARISHA: Five plus seven is 12, 24 plus five.

01:12:27.447 --> 01:12:31.172
MATT: Yeah, you just punch the door in and your
fist goes through it and you have to pull it off

01:12:31.172 --> 01:12:38.687
the hinges and shake it off of your giant
battering ram-like fist. The door opens, reveals a

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:40.557
singular chest against the other wall.

01:12:40.557 --> 01:12:42.369
MARISHA: Okay, I'll go ahead and open that.

01:12:42.369 --> 01:12:45.560
MATT: Well, it's an action to open it, but you can
move up. What's your movement as an earth

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.035
elemental?

01:12:47.035 --> 01:12:48.793
MARISHA: 30 feet walking.

01:12:48.793 --> 01:12:51.704
MATT: 30 feet? Yeah, you'd be able to just get up
to the chest but you don't have another action to

01:12:51.704 --> 01:12:52.913
open it.

01:12:52.913 --> 01:12:54.721
MARISHA: Okay. This is like a building, right?

01:12:54.721 --> 01:12:58.564
MATT: Yeah, you're having to duck down to get in
there. It's about ten feet tall and you're like

01:12:58.564 --> 01:13:03.999
eleven-foot tall as an earth elemental, probably
littler than 12, so you're crouched down a little

01:13:03.999 --> 01:13:05.240
bit.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:06.321
MARISHA: Okay, I'm in there then.

01:13:06.321 --> 01:13:08.194
MATT: That ends your turn, Percival, you're up.

01:13:08.194 --> 01:13:25.280
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to take this opportunity
to head out of the room and I want to climb up on

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:38.256
top of this building. Then right up to this corner
right here. Actually, this corner right there.

01:13:38.256 --> 01:13:41.547
MATT: Yeah, that's the end of your movement,
you'll be able to get there.

01:13:41.547 --> 01:13:42.869
TALIESIN: Can I see Grog?

01:13:42.869 --> 01:13:47.578
MATT: Currently no, you can not.

01:13:47.578 --> 01:13:49.047
TALIESIN: I can't see anybody.

01:13:49.047 --> 01:13:54.789
MATT: Nope. You have no sight on anybody. You get
to the top, aim, and the battlefield's quiet and

01:13:54.789 --> 01:13:56.551
empty and you're like, "Ah, fuck."

01:13:56.551 --> 01:13:58.316
SAM: You can't see Keyleth popping out of the--

01:13:58.316 --> 01:14:05.346
TALIESIN: No, she's inside. I'm going to go to the
center of it and if I could use my action to lay

01:14:05.346 --> 01:14:09.005
down and hide if that's possible?

01:14:09.005 --> 01:14:11.195
MATT: Well, your movement's there so you can't
move any further.

01:14:11.195 --> 01:14:18.299
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to lay down and, since
I'm on the roof, pull down to the roof and see if

01:14:18.299 --> 01:14:19.786
I can get cover.

01:14:19.786 --> 01:14:22.308
MATT: Okay. Are you trying to hide, or are you
just trying to give yourself cover?

01:14:22.308 --> 01:14:24.108
TALIESIN: Cover.

01:14:24.108 --> 01:14:25.603
MATT: So you're going prone.

01:14:25.603 --> 01:14:29.934
TALIESIN: I'm going prone and I want to keep an
eye on that front door.

01:14:29.934 --> 01:14:32.282
LIAM: It's movement to go up, is it movement to go
down?

01:14:32.282 --> 01:14:33.778
MATT: Yeah.

01:14:33.778 --> 01:14:36.836
LIAM: Got any left? Got any movement left? To go
prone?

01:14:36.836 --> 01:14:42.542
MATT: Well, no, to drop prone is fine. To get up
out of prone is just dropping to the ground.

01:14:42.542 --> 01:14:47.583
MARISHA: Is he close enough to where I feel a body
go (thud)?

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:53.513
TALIESIN: I'm also completely silenced. Ten feet
all around me are completely silenced.

01:14:53.513 --> 01:14:58.449
MATT: I know. Silence is different than vibration.
Unfortunately. I mean, it is vibration in the air,

01:14:58.449 --> 01:15:07.041
but that's not going to stop vibration in the
ground. It just dampens the sound. Nope. He's just

01:15:07.041 --> 01:15:08.621
outside of it, so you feel nothing.

01:15:08.621 --> 01:15:10.068
MARISHA: Damn it!

01:15:10.068 --> 01:15:13.379
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep an eye on that tower,
and if I see any movement I'm going to unload an

01:15:13.379 --> 01:15:16.652
action on anything I see.

01:15:16.652 --> 01:15:21.295
MATT: Got it. Make a general perception check for
me, if you don't mind.

01:15:21.295 --> 01:15:28.539
TALIESIN: I'm going to use one of my resolve.
That's a save.

01:15:28.539 --> 01:15:30.332
MATT: Saving throw, yeah, sorry.

01:15:30.332 --> 01:15:33.548
TALIESIN: Okay, perception. That's a 14.

01:15:33.548 --> 01:15:37.466
MATT: Ending Percy's turn, Scanlan, you're up.

01:15:37.466 --> 01:15:41.167
SAM: I'm going to cast Healing Word on myself, at
level one.

01:15:41.167 --> 01:15:42.387
MATT: Okay.

01:15:42.387 --> 01:15:44.052
LIAM: That is the coward's way.

01:15:44.052 --> 01:15:48.256
SAM: It's three plus six, right?

01:15:48.256 --> 01:15:49.771
MATT: Yes.

01:15:49.771 --> 01:16:02.013
SAM: Great, awesome, nine more points, guys! I can
see Grog. I could take a pot shot at him, but that

01:16:02.013 --> 01:16:05.762
would just kick the hornet's nest a bit.

01:16:05.762 --> 01:16:07.258
MATT: You think?

01:16:07.258 --> 01:16:12.683
SAM: I could score eight points of damage on him
and then die.

01:16:12.683 --> 01:16:16.676
MATT: Yeah. You'd die.

01:16:16.676 --> 01:16:30.452
SAM: I need to just heal. In that case, I will
dominate Grog.

01:16:30.452 --> 01:16:35.654
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

01:16:35.654 --> 01:16:45.144
SAM: Oh wait, shit, no, I can't do that. Is he
worked up, is he raging, can I tell?

01:16:45.144 --> 01:16:48.079
MATT: Oh, yeah, he's going (huffing).

01:16:48.079 --> 01:16:49.201
SAM: Okay, forget that then.

01:16:49.201 --> 01:16:52.004
MATT: Yeah, you've worked with him enough to know
that while he's raging charm effects--

01:16:52.004 --> 01:16:53.667
SAM: Forget it.

01:16:53.667 --> 01:16:56.873
MATT: Sorry. I'm giving you guys benefit of the
doubt that you've all worked together enough to

01:16:56.873 --> 01:17:01.498
the point where you do notice elements of
techniques and tells. Because it's helped you in

01:17:01.498 --> 01:17:02.887
the past.

01:17:02.887 --> 01:17:06.080
SAM: I could put on my hat of disguise.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:09.032
(laughter)

01:17:09.032 --> 01:17:11.953
MARISHA: What did Matt just say! We all know you
have that!

01:17:11.953 --> 01:17:15.327
SAM: No, just so that you guys would think I'm a
kindly old man who just walked onto the

01:17:15.327 --> 01:17:16.660
battlefield.

01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:18.762
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's see how well that goes.

01:17:18.762 --> 01:17:21.707
LIAM: Grog, put down your weapon!

01:17:21.707 --> 01:17:26.313
MATT: Let me tell you. If there's anything to turn
Vox Machina away, it's elderly people.

01:17:26.313 --> 01:17:33.437
LIAM: I was going to kill my friends, &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; now
there's this woman here.

01:17:33.437 --> 01:17:36.619
SAM: If I use my bonus action Healing Word, to
heal myself, can I also use my action to cast a

01:17:36.619 --> 01:17:38.607
higher level healing word on myself? Or is that--

01:17:38.607 --> 01:17:40.897
MATT: No, it's a bonus action, it's used. Sorry.

01:17:40.897 --> 01:17:55.061
SAM: Okay. Then I will cast Minor Image. Minor
Illusion or whatever it's called. That only has

01:17:55.061 --> 01:18:00.251
60-feet range, 30-feet range, 60-feet range?

01:18:00.251 --> 01:18:05.182
MARISHA: I smell so bad. I'm sweating so much.

01:18:05.182 --> 01:18:07.193
TALIESIN: You're fine! There's nothing.

01:18:07.193 --> 01:18:08.860
MARISHA: I need deodorant.

01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:12.404
SAM: Shit. You know what, I'll do Major Image
then. Fine. Fuck it. I'm going to do Major Image

01:18:12.404 --> 01:18:21.213
and it's going to sure look like Scanlan is just
walking right out to the edge of the water right

01:18:21.213 --> 01:18:24.003
there. Not from there.

01:18:24.003 --> 01:18:25.886
TALIESIN: Use the cake.

01:18:25.886 --> 01:18:33.260
SAM: He's just going to appear right there, he's
going to come out from around that corner and look

01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:36.271
out like he's looking for a target.

01:18:36.271 --> 01:18:43.648
MATT: Percival, glancing over you can see Scanlan
emerges from around the corner, keeping an eye,

01:18:43.648 --> 01:18:47.230
looking around the battlefield, and doesn't seem
to notice you're there.

01:18:47.230 --> 01:18:49.651
SAM: You have to shoot.

01:18:49.651 --> 01:18:52.152
MATT: Well, he wasn't holding an action.

01:18:52.152 --> 01:18:53.985
SAM: I thought you said you were holding your
action.

01:18:53.985 --> 01:18:55.298
TALIESIN: I'm holding an action for the tower.

01:18:55.298 --> 01:18:59.893
SAM: Got it. Wait, for the tower? I thought you
said "I'm holding an action until I see anyone."

01:18:59.893 --> 01:19:04.092
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye on the tower because
that's where I'm heading next.

01:19:04.092 --> 01:19:06.507
SAM: Okay. That's my action then. I'm done.

01:19:06.507 --> 01:19:09.119
TALIESIN: Don't worry, I will shoot at you.

01:19:09.119 --> 01:19:15.880
MATT: Grog. Top of your round. You watch as the
braziers at the base of the tower flare up and

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:20.941
flames consume this outer area just on the
outskirts. Not the top, but just the surrounding

01:19:20.941 --> 01:19:25.568
area of the tower and then die down, the walls of
flame burning to an ember and then vanishing. It's

01:19:25.568 --> 01:19:26.840
your turn.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:32.881
TRAVIS: Can I come inside here. Can you step on
that?

01:19:32.881 --> 01:19:40.736
MATT: It's a small, a sigil raised platform.

01:19:40.736 --> 01:19:46.280
TALIESIN: Do it. I dare you.

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.865
TRAVIS: I mean, I'm just curious. I mean it's hard
to--

01:19:48.865 --> 01:19:54.480
TALIESIN: Say yes. When in doubt, say yes. What's
the worst thing that can happen? Other than your

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:56.230
spells get disenchanted.

01:19:56.230 --> 01:19:57.512
MARISHA: Yes and, Travis.

01:19:57.512 --> 01:19:59.335
TRAVIS: I'll go through the portal.

01:19:59.335 --> 01:20:02.928
MATT: Okay. Out the other side you emerge.

01:20:02.928 --> 01:20:12.209
TRAVIS: Can I head this way? Can I dash and
continue my action and head towards--

01:20:12.209 --> 01:20:13.867
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:20:13.867 --> 01:20:19.190
TRAVIS: Head down this way.

01:20:19.190 --> 01:20:23.250
MATT: You get right up-- oh god. You get right
about there.

01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:31.882
TRAVIS: Can I use my bonus action to use my boots
of feral leaping to jump into the doorway?

01:20:31.882 --> 01:20:35.546
MATT: Sure.

01:20:35.546 --> 01:20:36.990
TRAVIS: No?

01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:42.308
MATT: Make an athletics check to see if it
succeeds.

01:20:42.308 --> 01:20:45.276
TALIESIN: I admire your commitment.

01:20:45.276 --> 01:20:46.512
TRAVIS: 27.

01:20:46.512 --> 01:20:49.321
MATT: Okay. Now I need you to make an acrobatics
check for me because it is a very small doorframe

01:20:49.321 --> 01:20:53.406
you're trying to leap into.

01:20:53.406 --> 01:20:56.527
TRAVIS: Oh, it's just the one. 13.

01:20:56.527 --> 01:21:06.267
MATT: You do jump, but your head and shoulders
slam into the doorframe. So you get the additional

01:21:06.267 --> 01:21:10.400
leap. You're now in the doorframe, you're
blocking it off. You have a little bit of extra

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:14.654
movement, but that's as far as you can get. You
have a ringing in your ears and you're like, "That

01:21:14.654 --> 01:21:15.547
"smarts a little bit."

01:21:15.547 --> 01:21:17.724
TRAVIS: That's my whole action.

01:21:17.724 --> 01:21:22.900
MATT: You, as you're there by the chest, you hear
(grunting). You turn around and see Grog in the

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:25.482
doorway like (grunting), looking at you right in
the face.

01:21:25.482 --> 01:21:27.402
MARISHA: In Terran I say: Hey Grog!

01:21:27.402 --> 01:21:28.461
TRAVIS: Hey!

01:21:28.461 --> 01:21:32.484
MATT: That finishes Grog's turn. Vax?

01:21:32.484 --> 01:21:34.684
LIAM: Quick question! Already sent.

01:21:34.684 --> 01:21:38.868
MATT: First question: no.

01:21:38.868 --> 01:21:40.037
LIAM: Okay.

01:21:40.037 --> 01:21:42.461
SAM: Second question: six inches soft.

01:21:42.461 --> 01:21:46.876
(laughter)

01:21:46.876 --> 01:21:52.022
LIAM: Is that true?! Tell me after. Okay.

01:21:52.022 --> 01:21:54.205
TALIESIN: Wow, man!

01:21:54.205 --> 01:21:56.597
MATT: Text your actions!

01:21:56.597 --> 01:22:02.550
TALIESIN: Mid-game! You're asking to get fucked
with!

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:09.233
SAM: Third question.

01:22:09.233 --> 01:22:10.894
LIAM: Yeah, no.

01:22:10.894 --> 01:22:13.546
SAM: Shaved.

01:22:13.546 --> 01:22:24.774
MATT: Jesus! Okay. Good to know. That brings us to
Keyleth.

01:22:24.774 --> 01:22:26.592
MARISHA: Okay!

01:22:26.592 --> 01:22:31.890
MATT: You're now between a chest and blocked door
frame with Grog in it.

01:22:31.890 --> 01:22:34.625
SAM: Wait. How the fuck did Grog get all the way
over there?!

01:22:34.625 --> 01:22:36.191
TRAVIS: Through the portal over here.

01:22:36.191 --> 01:22:37.507
SAM: That's amazing!

01:22:37.507 --> 01:22:38.871
TRAVIS: I was coming!

01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:42.079
TALIESIN: Don't call it a comeback, he's been
there for years.

01:22:42.079 --> 01:22:43.282
SAM: That's true.

01:22:43.282 --> 01:22:45.428
LIAM: Vax is somewhere going: You got this.

01:22:45.428 --> 01:22:50.305
MATT: Oh, I keep forgetting to ask you. Make a
concentration check when you took damage as a fire

01:22:50.305 --> 01:22:53.674
elemental with advantage.

01:22:53.674 --> 01:22:56.787
SAM: If it's anything like Hide &amp;amp; Seek, you'd
probably be like: I really have to pee right now.

01:22:56.787 --> 01:22:58.225
LIAM: I would just do it.

01:22:58.225 --> 01:22:59.581
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm good.

01:22:59.581 --> 01:23:01.744
MATT: With the fire elemental's constitution.

01:23:01.744 --> 01:23:09.861
MARISHA: Yeah, that's even better. What do I have
to make? I keep my spell attack, right?

01:23:09.861 --> 01:23:12.990
MATT: Yeah, I wanted to see if you lost
concentration on the Sunbeam.

01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:14.346
MARISHA: No, I'm good.

01:23:14.346 --> 01:23:20.128
MATT: All right, cool. It was 26 or 27 damage, so
you would have to make a 13 or 14.

01:23:20.128 --> 01:23:23.955
MARISHA: Yeah, then I just made it. No, I'm
totally good.

01:23:23.955 --> 01:23:33.112
MATT: What are you doing, Keyleth? You guys are
playing it really safe now!

01:23:33.112 --> 01:23:37.263
TRAVIS: I'm in the doorway with a giant earth
elemental. I punched my ticket; I'm ready to ring

01:23:37.263 --> 01:23:38.313
the bell.

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:39.436
MATT: That's true.

01:23:39.436 --> 01:23:43.523
SAM: I stuck my face out and I got 140 points of
damage.

01:23:43.523 --> 01:23:46.987
MATT: No, you-- okay.

01:23:46.987 --> 01:23:49.087
TRAVIS: Keyleth's smug. Scanlan's like: Ugh!

01:23:49.087 --> 01:23:51.729
MATT: I take it back. One of you is playing it
real safe.

01:23:51.729 --> 01:23:53.811
TALIESIN: We're aware!

01:23:53.811 --> 01:23:55.775
SAM: He may not even be playing with us.

01:23:55.775 --> 01:23:58.343
TALIESIN: He is on Twitter right now.

01:23:58.343 --> 01:24:00.692
LIAM: (singing) I stealthed myself out of the
narrative!

01:24:00.692 --> 01:24:03.459
(laughter)

01:24:03.459 --> 01:24:06.177
MATT: What're you doing, Keyleth?

01:24:06.177 --> 01:24:13.291
MARISHA: Can I take Grog and use my slam attacks,
my multiattack, to take him and body slam into

01:24:13.291 --> 01:24:14.748
this chest?

01:24:14.748 --> 01:24:19.046
MATT: Sure, you can certainly try!

01:24:19.046 --> 01:24:21.174
MARISHA: Yeah, sure!

01:24:21.174 --> 01:24:27.218
TRAVIS: If I can jump and smash my head on the door
like an idiot approaching you, might as well tit

01:24:27.218 --> 01:24:29.182
for tat.

01:24:29.182 --> 01:24:31.098
MATT: You first attack would have to be a grapple
attempt.

01:24:31.098 --> 01:24:32.646
MARISHA: My strength versus his, yeah?

01:24:32.646 --> 01:24:34.151
MATT: Your athletics versus his.

01:24:34.151 --> 01:24:35.871
MARISHA: I'm just an elemental; it doesn't tell me
that.

01:24:35.871 --> 01:24:40.078
MATT: If the elemental doesn't have any athletic
skill, then it's just your strength modifier. Go

01:24:40.078 --> 01:24:41.804
ahead and roll.

01:24:41.804 --> 01:24:46.804
MARISHA: I rolled a natural 18. So that puts me at
23.

01:24:46.804 --> 01:24:48.347
TRAVIS: 19.

01:24:48.347 --> 01:24:55.066
MATT: No shit?! I was not expecting that! Not with
advantage! You reach out and grab, and you have

01:24:55.066 --> 01:24:57.080
Grog. Make your other slam attack.

01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.366
MARISHA: Which is a slam attack to hit?

01:24:59.366 --> 01:25:00.828
MATT: Correct.

01:25:00.828 --> 01:25:03.925
MARISHA: 17.

01:25:03.925 --> 01:25:07.583
MATT: 17, this is against the chest, technically.
What's your armor class?

01:25:07.583 --> 01:25:08.736
TRAVIS: 17.

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:20.345
MATT: Yeah. Okay. You reach and grab Grog. You
slam him and it destroys the chest. It splinters

01:25:20.345 --> 01:25:22.556
underneath. Roll your slam attack damage.

01:25:22.556 --> 01:25:31.201
MARISHA: Which isn't great. Six plus three, nine,
plus five, so 14 damage.

01:25:31.201 --> 01:25:33.605
MATT: 14 points of bludgeoning damage to you,
Grog.

01:25:33.605 --> 01:25:34.774
TRAVIS: Seven.

01:25:34.774 --> 01:25:41.085
MATT: You're not prone, but you are moved to the
opposite side of her. The chest is shattered

01:25:41.085 --> 01:25:42.340
beneath you.

01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:44.024
LIAM and SAM: Shit!

01:25:44.024 --> 01:25:46.214
MARISHA: Did it release a poison trap in any way?

01:25:46.214 --> 01:25:51.089
MATT: I need you to make a constitution saving
throw. Grog, you make another one as all of a

01:25:51.089 --> 01:25:55.648
sudden, poison gas fills the entirety of the
chamber around you as soon as you destroy this

01:25:55.648 --> 01:25:56.827
chest.

01:25:56.827 --> 01:25:58.262
MARISHA: I'm immune to poison.

01:25:58.262 --> 01:25:59.731
MATT: You are unaffected by any of it.

01:25:59.731 --> 01:26:04.192
TRAVIS: That's cool. 29. 17 plus 12.

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:05.819
MATT: So you succeed.

01:26:05.819 --> 01:26:07.099
SAM: Are you double poisoned?

01:26:07.099 --> 01:26:14.062
TRAVIS: I guess so. Start stroking out here in a
second.

01:26:14.062 --> 01:26:22.249
MATT: 18 points of poison damage reduced to nine.

01:26:22.249 --> 01:26:25.868
MARISHA: Does he take poison at the top of each
turn?

01:26:25.868 --> 01:26:28.729
MATT: No, but he's poisoned, so he has
disadvantage on attacks and ability checks until

01:26:28.729 --> 01:26:30.802
he gets rid of the poison.

01:26:30.802 --> 01:26:33.322
TRAVIS: Can I make a retaliation? Is that
considered melee?

01:26:33.322 --> 01:26:35.347
MATT: Against her? Yeah, I'll allow it.

01:26:35.347 --> 01:26:37.260
TRAVIS: But I'm prone.

01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:41.570
MATT: You're not prone. She just moved you over
and slammed you into it. You managed to maneuver

01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:47.280
and get back on your feet, but your impact against the
chest destroyed it and released the trap inside.

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.942
TRAVIS: I haven't been able to say this in a long
time: Can I make this Reckless, Great Weapon

01:26:49.942 --> 01:26:51.110
Master?

01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:53.013
MATT: You can, but you have disadvantage on the
attack because of the poison, so it's just a

01:26:53.013 --> 01:26:54.369
single strike.

01:26:54.369 --> 01:26:56.513
TRAVIS: 26.

01:26:56.513 --> 01:26:57.705
MARISHA: That hits for sure.

01:26:57.705 --> 01:27:00.887
TALIESIN: It's going to make life complicated.

01:27:00.887 --> 01:27:02.320
SAM: Yeah, I know!

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.651
TALIESIN: I've got shit I can do, but it's going
to be tricky.

01:27:04.651 --> 01:27:06.284
SAM: You have to see the people you're doing it
to.

01:27:06.284 --> 01:27:07.360
TRAVIS: 32.

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:08.888
MATT: 32 points of slashing damage.

01:27:08.888 --> 01:27:10.893
MARISHA: Ooh! It's pretty good!

01:27:10.893 --> 01:27:18.781
TALIESIN: That was foolish of you. Well, I don't
know. You always have a plan. I ain't going to

01:27:18.781 --> 01:27:19.947
push it.

01:27:19.947 --> 01:27:21.065
SAM: I don't have a plan tonight.

01:27:21.065 --> 01:27:22.194
TALIESIN: I don't believe you.

01:27:22.194 --> 01:27:26.607
MARISHA: Did I break any potions that were under
him when I slammed him into the chest?

01:27:26.607 --> 01:27:31.021
MATT: Right now, the whole place is filled with
poison smoke. You have no idea.

01:27:31.021 --> 01:27:34.377
MARISHA: I'm going to take my movement to get the
fuck out of here.

01:27:34.377 --> 01:27:38.727
MATT: You have full movement, he already used his
reaction so he doesn't get an attack of

01:27:38.727 --> 01:27:40.318
opportunity on you.

01:27:40.318 --> 01:27:50.170
MARISHA: Can I go 20, use my bonus action to turn
into a water elemental and then dive under this

01:27:50.170 --> 01:27:51.439
water?

01:27:51.439 --> 01:27:53.676
TRAVIS: How many elementals can you turn into?

01:27:53.676 --> 01:27:55.002
MARISHA: All of them.

01:27:55.002 --> 01:27:56.712
TRAVIS: An unlimited number of times?

01:27:56.712 --> 01:28:00.527
MARISHA: Yeah. Archdruid shit.

01:28:00.527 --> 01:28:04.037
MATT: You are submerged in this water.

01:28:04.037 --> 01:28:06.937
TALIESIN: It's why Scanlan's not dead yet. I just
wanted to make him desperate.

01:28:06.937 --> 01:28:08.418
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:28:08.418 --> 01:28:10.523
MATT: That ends Keyleth's turn.

01:28:10.523 --> 01:28:11.853
MARISHA: That ends my turn!

01:28:11.853 --> 01:28:18.012
MATT: Percival, you're up. You turn around and you
watch around the corner you have Scanlan peeking

01:28:18.012 --> 01:28:22.268
around one side and you have Keyleth coming out as
an earth elemental, turning into a water elemental

01:28:22.268 --> 01:28:25.088
then disappearing beneath the surface of the
water.

01:28:25.088 --> 01:28:26.967
TALIESIN: I can't see anything else?

01:28:26.967 --> 01:28:29.602
MATT: Nope. But you did hear the impact.

01:28:29.602 --> 01:28:31.016
TALIESIN: No, I didn't.

01:28:31.016 --> 01:28:32.581
MARISHA: Can't hear shit.

01:28:32.581 --> 01:28:34.235
MATT: Oh, right. Silence, yeah.

01:28:34.235 --> 01:28:36.843
TRAVIS: There's a giant tidal wave moving yonder.

01:28:36.843 --> 01:28:42.648
TALIESIN: There's a bard over there. I'm going to
take a jump onto that island.

01:28:42.648 --> 01:28:46.379
MARISHA: I'm stealthing, if that was not clear.
Hiding under there.

01:28:46.379 --> 01:28:52.622
TALIESIN: Acrobatics check. That's 24.

01:28:52.622 --> 01:28:54.371
MATT: 24.

01:28:54.371 --> 01:28:57.892
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend the rest of my movement
running straight up that tower.

01:28:57.892 --> 01:29:10.147
MATT: Okay! As you enter the tower--

01:29:10.147 --> 01:29:14.479
TALIESIN: I'm not entering the tower. I'm running
up the tower. Sorry. My fault.

01:29:14.479 --> 01:29:17.936
MATT: Ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

01:29:17.936 --> 01:29:19.669
TALIESIN: And then double run.

01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:25.553
MATT: You're up on the tower now. As you get to
the top of the tower, you glance over and the

01:29:25.553 --> 01:29:34.145
column of green energy that was left behind when
Colville vanished sits there, creating this beam.

01:29:34.145 --> 01:29:40.753
This central, circular area right there is infused
with soft, sparkling, greenish energy.

01:29:40.753 --> 01:29:47.424
TALIESIN: Huh. I've been having bad luck with that
lately.

01:29:47.424 --> 01:29:49.871
TRAVIS: The whole top of the tower, or just the
middle of it?

01:29:49.871 --> 01:29:51.672
MATT: Just the center circle.

01:29:51.672 --> 01:29:53.248
TRAVIS: Is there a latch?

01:29:53.248 --> 01:29:56.313
MATT: There is a trap door over that.

01:29:56.313 --> 01:30:04.727
TALIESIN: I'm going to take cover from Scanlan
right there with what's left of my movement

01:30:04.727 --> 01:30:06.472
against one of the walls.

01:30:06.472 --> 01:30:07.994
MATT: You back up against the wall.

01:30:07.994 --> 01:30:10.863
TALIESIN: I'm backing up against the wall and
that's my turn.

01:30:10.863 --> 01:30:15.693
MATT: You currently have three-quarters cover in
that space.

01:30:15.693 --> 01:30:17.035
TALIESIN: Okay. That'll do.

01:30:17.035 --> 01:30:20.550
MATT: Ending Percival's turn, Scanlan, you're up.

01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:21.880
SAM: Bonus action: Healing Word.

01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:26.972
MATT: Yes. So you're holding your Major Image of
Scanlan out there right now. Grog, you saw enter

01:30:26.972 --> 01:30:29.127
the chamber and vanish into the doorway.

01:30:29.127 --> 01:30:35.263
SAM: Do I know where that goes? No. I don't know
how those things work. I heard a bunch of smashing

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:40.270
kitty-corner to me and I haven't seen anything
else.

01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:41.130
MATT: Nope!

01:30:41.130 --> 01:30:42.004
SAM: Cool.

01:30:42.004 --> 01:30:44.809
TRAVIS: You could stand on that thing, though, the
platform.

01:30:44.809 --> 01:30:46.805
SAM: What?

01:30:46.805 --> 01:30:51.045
TRAVIS: It looks super-magical, this thing. It's
awesome. There's even little feet right here.

01:30:51.045 --> 01:30:52.726
SAM: That sounds great.

01:30:52.726 --> 01:30:54.850
TRAVIS: I don't know what those are. Are they
boots?

01:30:54.850 --> 01:30:59.448
MARISHA: Stand here. Yeah, you beat me to it!

01:30:59.448 --> 01:31:13.279
SAM: I'm going to have Major Image Scanlan ice
skate across the water in a jaunty way.

01:31:13.279 --> 01:31:14.558
TRAVIS: Ice skating?

01:31:14.558 --> 01:31:17.339
SAM: He's walking on water, as I've always wanted
to do.

01:31:17.339 --> 01:31:19.676
MARISHA and TRAVIS: You can do that?!

01:31:19.676 --> 01:31:21.327
SAM: He's not a real thing.

01:31:21.327 --> 01:31:22.739
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

01:31:22.739 --> 01:31:38.072
SAM: He can do anything. He's going to walk across
the water going, "Hey! Over here! Hey!" While he's

01:31:38.072 --> 01:31:41.664
creating that distraction, I'm going to peek
around and see if I see anything around the

01:31:41.664 --> 01:31:42.714
tower.

01:31:42.714 --> 01:31:43.635
MATT: Around this way?

01:31:43.635 --> 01:31:44.431
SAM: Yeah.

01:31:44.431 --> 01:31:46.440
MATT: You peek around the tower there.

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:47.362
SAM: Anything?

01:31:47.362 --> 01:31:55.994
MATT: Make a perception check, please. I would
like you to make a perception check as well.

01:31:55.994 --> 01:31:57.751
SAM: 15.

01:31:57.751 --> 01:32:04.130
MATT: You glance around. You can see, just on the
top of the tower, shoulder against the area, the

01:32:04.130 --> 01:32:09.661
outer edge of Percival's form holding his gun up
and taking cover right up on the side there.

01:32:09.661 --> 01:32:10.798
SAM: Okay, I duck back.

01:32:10.798 --> 01:32:15.754
LIAM: Where's my Colville die?

01:32:15.754 --> 01:32:17.289
MATT: End of your turn, Scanlan?

01:32:17.289 --> 01:32:18.258
SAM: That's it, yeah.

01:32:18.258 --> 01:32:25.640
MATT: The flames burst from the braziers around
the tower. The entire area incinerates around the

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:26.823
outside.

01:32:26.823 --> 01:32:28.328
TALIESIN: It did that last round.

01:32:28.328 --> 01:32:29.994
MATT: You're right, I marked that incorrectly.

01:32:29.994 --> 01:32:31.697
TALIESIN: I've been keeping track.

01:32:31.697 --> 01:32:38.802
MATT: I forgot to mark that. You watch as the two
separate towers give off a burst of lightning

01:32:38.802 --> 01:32:49.816
energy and do not affect anybody. Keyleth, you
notice this. As you're inside the water, which is

01:32:49.816 --> 01:32:51.830
just regular water.

01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:52.978
MARISHA: Good!

01:32:52.978 --> 01:32:58.700
MATT: As you're swimming through it, regular
water. Not terribly deep, it's about three or four

01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:03.968
feet deep. You're flattening form as a water
elemental to hide beneath the surface. You get the

01:33:03.968 --> 01:33:11.468
sense the water around you is starting to vibrate
a little bit. There's a strange effervescence to

01:33:11.468 --> 01:33:16.535
it that wasn't there a moment ago. That's all.
Grog, you're up.

01:33:16.535 --> 01:33:21.337
LIAM: I sent a question and the answer to your
roll, too. Sorry.

01:33:21.337 --> 01:33:23.631
TALIESIN: Wonderful bottle of Pellegrino for the
table.

01:33:23.631 --> 01:33:25.340
SAM: Naturally sparkling.

01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:30.088
MATT: You rolled 27? You heard (footsteps).

01:33:30.088 --> 01:33:34.289
TALIESIN: No, you wouldn't have heard. Ten feet.

01:33:34.289 --> 01:33:36.283
MATT: That's right.

01:33:36.283 --> 01:33:37.529
TALIESIN: Sorry, didn't hear it.

01:33:37.529 --> 01:33:38.833
MATT: Nothing.

01:33:38.833 --> 01:33:43.120
TRAVIS: Silent motherfucker. You're a goddamn Navy
SEAL.

01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:50.732
TALIESIN: This is why in a normal game this would be
completely crippling me because anything could be

01:33:50.732 --> 01:33:56.198
happening and you could not tell me. But on a solo
mission, it's pretty nice.

01:33:56.198 --> 01:34:01.356
TRAVIS: In the room that I'm in, can I see
anything on the floor since I've been poisoned

01:34:01.356 --> 01:34:02.673
fucking twice now?!

01:34:02.673 --> 01:34:10.034
MATT: The cloud dissipates. You said you
want to sift through the rubble?

01:34:10.034 --> 01:34:11.852
TRAVIS: To see if there's a potion.

01:34:11.852 --> 01:34:13.390
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:34:13.390 --> 01:34:16.855
TRAVIS: Hey! Minus how much? Two. 13!

01:34:16.855 --> 01:34:23.639
MATT: You spend your action rummaging through the
shattered remains of this. You find bits of the

01:34:23.639 --> 01:34:30.121
trap mechanism within there and you find a
shattered glass vial with trace elements of a

01:34:30.121 --> 01:34:32.609
healing potion that has since been destroyed.

01:34:32.609 --> 01:34:35.111
TRAVIS: Can I get down and (licking)?

01:34:35.111 --> 01:34:41.453
MATT: You do! You get down there. You get a
familiar weird medicinal, herbal flavor that is

01:34:41.453 --> 01:34:45.027
mingled with shards of glass that are gathering on
the outskirts of your tongue.

01:34:45.027 --> 01:34:53.961
TRAVIS: Not worth it. Okay. Yeah, let's see what
happens. Can I run out of the room? I'm going to

01:34:53.961 --> 01:35:02.208
head towards the back portal. Actually, can I get
to here? She's in the water, right? She's not

01:35:02.208 --> 01:35:03.810
sticking out some?

01:35:03.810 --> 01:35:05.255
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:35:05.255 --> 01:35:08.261
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

01:35:08.261 --> 01:35:14.347
MATT: You glance over and you can see in the water
the slight, very different movement of the water.

01:35:14.347 --> 01:35:19.759
You can basically see a slight form in there. Only
because you rolled really high.

01:35:19.759 --> 01:35:22.856
MARISHA: Man, you beat me last time with a really
high roll.

01:35:22.856 --> 01:35:28.928
TRAVIS: I'm an idiot, but you have to be really dumb
to go chopping at the water with an axe. It's just

01:35:28.928 --> 01:35:30.159
water.

01:35:30.159 --> 01:35:35.210
SAM: You would be just dumb enough to do that.

01:35:35.210 --> 01:35:38.269
TALIESIN: Only a truly dumb person.

01:35:38.269 --> 01:35:40.765
TRAVIS: She's just going to change again.

01:35:40.765 --> 01:35:44.622
MATT: You used 25 of your movement, you still have
25 left. You've used your action.

01:35:44.622 --> 01:35:58.537
TRAVIS: I'll keep running to the entranceway and
I'll stay outside. Do I have any more movement?

01:35:58.537 --> 01:36:00.386
MATT: You have five feet more.

01:36:00.386 --> 01:36:01.972
TRAVIS: I can't get around the corner, right?

01:36:01.972 --> 01:36:05.179
MATT: Nah, you'd have to move next to it.

01:36:05.179 --> 01:36:06.591
TRAVIS: I'm good.

01:36:06.591 --> 01:36:10.332
MATT: You're on deck, Keyleth.

01:36:10.332 --> 01:36:18.848
SAM: (sings with background music)

01:36:18.848 --> 01:36:23.119
TRAVIS: Should have a countdown clock.

01:36:23.119 --> 01:36:28.829
SAM: (sings with background music)

01:36:28.829 --> 01:36:30.474
LIAM: There.

01:36:30.474 --> 01:36:31.936
MATT: All righty.

01:36:31.936 --> 01:36:34.644
SAM: Man, Liam's RP is so good tonight!

01:36:34.644 --> 01:36:39.520
MATT: That ends Vax's turn, Keyleth, you're up.

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:44.061
LIAM: Hey man, I took my heart out and did this
for 115 episodes, all right?! Staying alive!

01:36:44.061 --> 01:36:46.257
SAM: The last move, though, was so goth!

01:36:46.257 --> 01:36:53.553
MARISHA: I'm going to come out of the water like
the Swamp Thing. I'm going to beam Grog with

01:36:53.553 --> 01:36:55.089
another Sunbeam.

01:36:55.089 --> 01:37:00.462
MATT: Grog, as you're waiting on the side, you
hear the ripple of water as you glance over. You

01:37:00.462 --> 01:37:07.406
watch this giant wave as Keyleth's elemental
form emerges from the water. Out of the middle of

01:37:07.406 --> 01:37:10.279
it, this beam of energy. I need you to make a
constitution saving throw.

01:37:10.279 --> 01:37:22.367
TRAVIS: Wait. Mage Slayer. Advantage on saving
throws against spells? I have to be in melee of

01:37:22.367 --> 01:37:23.412
them.

01:37:23.412 --> 01:37:24.898
MATT: You might have to be in melee?

01:37:24.898 --> 01:37:26.230
TRAVIS: I think that might be right.

01:37:26.230 --> 01:37:27.759
MATT: I'll double check, just to be safe.

01:37:27.759 --> 01:37:33.196
TRAVIS: I'm poisoned, so I have disadvantage on
saves, right?

01:37:33.196 --> 01:37:35.275
MATT: "Against spells cast within five feet of
you."

01:37:35.275 --> 01:37:37.978
TRAVIS: Because I'm poisoned, I have to roll this
again for disadvantage?

01:37:37.978 --> 01:37:40.998
MATT: Poisoned just gives you disadvantage on
ability checks and attacks.

01:37:40.998 --> 01:37:42.257
TRAVIS: Not saving throws?

01:37:42.257 --> 01:37:43.269
MATT: Correct.

01:37:43.269 --> 01:37:44.718
TRAVIS: 25.

01:37:44.718 --> 01:37:47.258
MATT: Yeah, you take half damage and you're not
blinded.

01:37:47.258 --> 01:37:48.406
TRAVIS: Oh, cool.

01:37:48.406 --> 01:38:01.334
MARISHA: Your half damage is a ten, (counting) 21.
Not a great roll this go around.

01:38:01.334 --> 01:38:08.753
MATT: You take ten points of radiant damage.
Blasted, it burns past your skin. It tickles a

01:38:08.753 --> 01:38:10.591
little. It's like a bad sunburn.

01:38:10.591 --> 01:38:15.688
MARISHA: I'm going to go into my earth elemental
form and--

01:38:15.688 --> 01:38:21.499
TALIESIN: This is disturbing. I don't know what to
do about this.

01:38:21.499 --> 01:38:22.767
LIAM: Die!

01:38:22.767 --> 01:38:25.059
TRAVIS: Probably not kill the other caster, you
know.

01:38:25.059 --> 01:38:26.422
TALIESIN: I didn't!

01:38:26.422 --> 01:38:31.930
MARISHA: Is this an actual window here?

01:38:31.930 --> 01:38:37.844
MATT: They're small slits that you can see
through, but that's it.

01:38:37.844 --> 01:38:40.032
MARISHA: Okay! Yeah. Sure.

01:38:40.032 --> 01:38:44.451
MATT: That ends your turn. Percival.

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:48.992
TALIESIN: God. I didn't see her do that, did I?

01:38:48.992 --> 01:38:52.478
MATT: No. From where you're standing, you heard
the blast.

01:38:52.478 --> 01:38:53.676
MARISHA: He can't hear shit.

01:38:53.676 --> 01:38:57.848
MATT: No, that's right! Silence spell, man. It's
creepily quiet.

01:38:57.848 --> 01:39:02.402
TRAVIS: You take the good, you take the bad, you
take them both and then you have Percy silence.

01:39:02.402 --> 01:39:04.461
LIAM: Take your die of inspiration.

01:39:04.461 --> 01:39:12.489
TALIESIN: I'm so fucked. Yep. This is dumb, but
I'm going to do it because I don't know you're

01:39:12.489 --> 01:39:19.055
there. I'm going to walk over to that weird little
door.

01:39:19.055 --> 01:39:29.952
MATT: You walk into the greenish energy. As you
step into this field, your body feels warm. No

01:39:29.952 --> 01:39:33.151
sound.

01:39:33.151 --> 01:39:35.528
TALIESIN: I just feel warm.

01:39:35.528 --> 01:39:37.050
MATT: You just feel warm.

01:39:37.050 --> 01:39:38.284
MARISHA: It's a patio heater.

01:39:38.284 --> 01:39:42.301
TALIESIN: I'm going to open the door and see
what's in there.

01:39:42.301 --> 01:39:46.792
MATT: As you go to pull for the door, it (clicks).
I mean, you don't hear a sound, but it resists.

01:39:46.792 --> 01:39:48.783
LIAM: Oh, blew your action.

01:39:48.783 --> 01:39:57.540
MARISHA: Man, we get so catty when we can! It's so
much fun!

01:39:57.540 --> 01:39:59.378
LIAM: This is all I've got.

01:39:59.378 --> 01:40:01.674
MARISHA: We're never mean to each other, you
guys.

01:40:01.674 --> 01:40:07.217
TALIESIN: All right, just because this green glow
is freaking me out, I'm going to back up against

01:40:07.217 --> 01:40:10.627
the wall and then my next action later is going to
be--

01:40:10.627 --> 01:40:12.186
MATT: Have you taken any damage?

01:40:12.186 --> 01:40:15.476
TALIESIN: Have I taken any? Yeah, I've taken 16
points of damage.

01:40:15.476 --> 01:40:25.250
MATT: Okay, you sense as you're stepping in there,
not immediately but the sensation is that similar

01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:32.036
to one of your allies were to cast a Cure Wounds
on you, it has a sort of regenerative property to

01:40:32.036 --> 01:40:35.050
it, the longer you stand in it. It hasn't taken
effect yet.

01:40:35.050 --> 01:40:38.944
TALIESIN: Okay, then I'm not going to back up out
of it, I'm going to get to the back side of the

01:40:38.944 --> 01:40:45.639
hinge and I can't hold an action, obviously,
because I blew my action, but I'm going to prepare

01:40:45.639 --> 01:40:48.901
to open and worry about what comes out.

01:40:48.901 --> 01:40:52.252
MATT: Okay, so you go up into the very edge of
that radius and just hold your weapon.

01:40:52.252 --> 01:40:53.298
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:40:53.298 --> 01:40:56.054
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn. Scanlan, you're
up.

01:40:56.054 --> 01:41:01.300
SAM: Hi guys, Scanlan Shorthalt here.

01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:05.269
TALIESIN: With a very important message about
Marvel Puzzle Quest.

01:41:05.269 --> 01:41:07.110
MARISHA: I like your crown.

01:41:07.110 --> 01:41:08.758
SAM: Thanks.

01:41:08.758 --> 01:41:11.810
TALIESIN: It's nice, it would look good on me.

01:41:11.810 --> 01:41:17.928
SAM: It's lofty. Knowing where Percy is, I'm going
to peek around the corner.

01:41:17.928 --> 01:41:26.441
MATT: Peek around the corner, at this view, you do
not have eyeline on Percival.

01:41:26.441 --> 01:41:28.328
SAM: Sure, but I kind of know he's up there.

01:41:28.328 --> 01:41:29.629
MATT: You know he's up on the tower.

01:41:29.629 --> 01:41:31.808
SAM: And I heard booms distantly over here.

01:41:31.808 --> 01:41:38.051
MATT: You did, you heard thuds of impacts and a
burst of energy, you saw like a bright light glow

01:41:38.051 --> 01:41:40.460
up over the distant sky for a moment.

01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:44.062
SAM: Feeling a red-hot anger towards Percy for
shooting me--

01:41:44.062 --> 01:41:45.708
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. Bring it.

01:41:45.708 --> 01:41:53.400
SAM: And also gaming out that there's people over
here, right centered on this spot I'm going to cast

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:54.802
Anti-Gravity.

01:41:54.802 --> 01:41:58.227
MATT: Reverse Gravity?

01:41:58.227 --> 01:41:59.511
SAM: Reverse Gravity.

01:41:59.511 --> 01:42:00.748
MATT: Okay, on that spot.

01:42:00.748 --> 01:42:03.155
MARISHA: Okay, that's fun.

01:42:03.155 --> 01:42:08.595
MATT: All right, your illusion fades, it's
concentration.

01:42:08.595 --> 01:42:14.514
MARISHA: That's one spell I wish we got to use
more in-campaign, it's a fun one.

01:42:14.514 --> 01:42:18.045
MATT: Bringing it back.

01:42:18.045 --> 01:42:20.761
SAM: 50-foot radius.

01:42:20.761 --> 01:42:25.309
MATT: 50-foot radius which would also affect
Keyleth.

01:42:25.309 --> 01:42:27.391
SAM: Keyleth for sure.

01:42:27.391 --> 01:42:29.020
TALIESIN: And anybody in the tower.

01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:40.171
MATT: Yep. All right so I need Keyleth and
Percival to both make a dexterity saving throw.

01:42:40.171 --> 01:42:43.127
TALIESIN: What about my Boots of Spider Climbing
that are currently activated?

01:42:43.127 --> 01:42:47.454
MATT: I need Keyleth to make a dexterity saving
throw.

01:42:47.454 --> 01:42:49.848
MARISHA: This is going to be bad.

01:42:49.848 --> 01:42:53.177
SAM: Are they always attached? Nice!

01:42:53.177 --> 01:42:59.203
TALIESIN: They're activated, I ain't moving. I
can't be knocked prone, you can't do shit.

01:42:59.203 --> 01:43:00.460
MARISHA: 12.

01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:02.286
MATT: 12? No.

01:43:02.286 --> 01:43:05.882
MARISHA: All right, let's go for a ride.

01:43:05.882 --> 01:43:07.059
SAM: 100 feet up.

01:43:07.059 --> 01:43:10.726
MARISHA: Whee!

01:43:10.726 --> 01:43:15.876
MATT: (counting) That's 50.

01:43:15.876 --> 01:43:18.920
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:21.916
MATT: This is going to be interesting.

01:43:21.916 --> 01:43:29.533
SAM: Because you said the top is like 90 feet up,
so I want her to go all the way up to the

01:43:29.533 --> 01:43:30.593
ceiling.

01:43:30.593 --> 01:43:31.995
TALIESIN: And then see what happens.

01:43:31.995 --> 01:43:35.250
TRAVIS: A little unintentional Keyteor.

01:43:35.250 --> 01:43:37.514
MARISHA: Yeah, a hundred percent.

01:43:37.514 --> 01:43:44.381
MATT: Keyleth, you suddenly go firing up into the
sky. Percival, you watch as Keyleth spins up,

01:43:44.381 --> 01:43:51.699
slams into the top of the field, I need you to
make a constitution saving throw.

01:43:51.699 --> 01:43:58.139
MARISHA: Just a straight con save? Not good,
seven.

01:43:58.139 --> 01:44:09.652
MATT: You take 29 points of force damage as you
slam into the field, and then it thrusts you 15

01:44:09.652 --> 01:44:12.711
feet away from it, and then you head back towards
it.

01:44:12.711 --> 01:44:14.405
TRAVIS: Do the basketball.

01:44:14.405 --> 01:44:16.645
TALIESIN: Oh no, oh no.

01:44:16.645 --> 01:44:23.722
MATT: So it won't affect you this round, but
you're currently being just bludgeoned repeatedly.

01:44:23.722 --> 01:44:29.110
Percival, your hair is standing up on end above
you.

01:44:29.110 --> 01:44:30.857
MARISHA: This is like some Freddie Krueger shit.

01:44:30.857 --> 01:44:36.121
MATT: You take a moment to try and right yourself
and are now finding yourself having to fly upside

01:44:36.121 --> 01:44:37.355
down.

01:44:37.355 --> 01:44:38.748
LIAM: But that's the same shit, right?

01:44:38.748 --> 01:44:43.301
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. It doesn't do anything to
you, but it took you a moment to readjust.

01:44:43.301 --> 01:44:46.956
SAM: I'll duck back behind the thing.

01:44:46.956 --> 01:44:48.324
LIAM: And nobody knows where I am.

01:44:48.324 --> 01:44:53.025
TRAVIS: Yeah, we know, okay, we know. AT&amp;amp;T thanks
you for your texts.

01:44:53.025 --> 01:45:00.677
SAM: And I will say: drat, it didn't work on
Percy. I'll use my bonus action to say: Percy, I

01:45:00.677 --> 01:45:02.130
wasn't aiming at you!

01:45:02.130 --> 01:45:03.454
MATT: He doesn't hear it.

01:45:03.454 --> 01:45:05.016
SAM: Shit! He doesn't hear anything!

01:45:05.016 --> 01:45:07.740
MATT: That ends Scanlan's turn.

01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:12.751
TALIESIN: I have been waiting to use this Silence
spell like an asshole this entire game.

01:45:12.751 --> 01:45:18.634
LIAM: I rolled a 21 for that roll. That didn't do
it, did it? I sent you my roll. They rolled, so

01:45:18.634 --> 01:45:20.594
did I. I texted you a 21.

01:45:20.594 --> 01:45:24.729
MATT: It didn't affect anything because you were
flying.

01:45:24.729 --> 01:45:26.199
LIAM: Oh, okay.

01:45:26.199 --> 01:45:30.246
MATT: You had to right yourself, but as soon as
you started flying upward, you went, "Oh crap!"

01:45:30.246 --> 01:45:40.575
and you caught yourself. That brings us to Grog's
turn at the top of the round. Keyleth and Scanlan,

01:45:40.575 --> 01:45:46.628
definitely not Percival. Grog, you notice this,
too. Behind the entire chamber on each side, it

01:45:46.628 --> 01:45:51.935
suddenly fills and flashes with that purplish-blue
energy. The energy travels through the center and

01:45:51.935 --> 01:46:00.548
all the water and surrounding also flashes
once with that same purple-blue flash and then

01:46:00.548 --> 01:46:07.407
dissipates and returns to what it was before. You
now notice that those rooms are connected to the

01:46:07.407 --> 01:46:10.868
water and whatever's in the water when that goes
off--

01:46:10.868 --> 01:46:12.365
MARISHA: That was the blue spheres?

01:46:12.365 --> 01:46:14.257
MATT: No, that was the purple.

01:46:14.257 --> 01:46:16.519
TALIESIN: Purple horseshoes.

01:46:16.519 --> 01:46:18.603
LIAM: TGIF Flair.

01:46:18.603 --> 01:46:19.928
MATT: Grog, you're up.

01:46:19.928 --> 01:46:29.233
TRAVIS: I'm going to go into the room. Can I stand
on the crystal circle? Because I don't see anybody

01:46:29.233 --> 01:46:30.478
else to hit.

01:46:30.478 --> 01:46:32.411
MATT: You step onto the crystal circle.

01:46:32.411 --> 01:46:36.518
TRAVIS: I concentrate real hard.

01:46:36.518 --> 01:46:39.069
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

01:46:39.069 --> 01:46:42.751
TRAVIS: Nine.

01:46:42.751 --> 01:46:47.096
MATT: It's hard to concentrate. It's really warm
under your feet.

01:46:47.096 --> 01:46:52.415
TRAVIS: That's it? Do I notice any writing or
bones around the circle?

01:46:52.415 --> 01:46:58.140
MATT: No. It's pretty clear. But you're a few
inches taller than you were a second ago because

01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:00.016
you're on the platform. That's cool.

01:47:00.016 --> 01:47:03.504
TRAVIS: I don't see anybody. Does it go out to the
water?

01:47:03.504 --> 01:47:05.411
MATT: Yes, it opens up out to the water.

01:47:05.411 --> 01:47:11.797
TRAVIS: Did I happen to see Keyleth in her earth
elemental form, since I was outside, go whoosh and

01:47:11.797 --> 01:47:12.779
fly up?

01:47:12.779 --> 01:47:14.361
MATT: Yes. You're watching her being--

01:47:14.361 --> 01:47:20.634
TRAVIS: That seems wrong. Okay. I'm going to use
my bonus action to take one of my superior healing

01:47:20.634 --> 01:47:22.718
potions and that's my turn.

01:47:22.718 --> 01:47:24.368
MATT: 8d4 plus eight.

01:47:24.368 --> 01:47:27.888
LIAM: Sent you a monologue.

01:47:27.888 --> 01:47:31.136
TALIESIN: O for a muse of fire!

01:47:31.136 --> 01:47:34.421
LIAM: To be or not to be!

01:47:34.421 --> 01:47:39.841
MATT: Keyleth, you're up!

01:47:39.841 --> 01:47:42.143
TALIESIN: And down. And up and down.

01:47:42.143 --> 01:47:48.597
MARISHA: I'm going to use my bonus action to turn
into an air elemental and fly.

01:47:48.597 --> 01:47:52.617
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. Not cool!

01:47:52.617 --> 01:47:55.683
MARISHA: I'm so hot. So sexy.

01:47:55.683 --> 01:47:57.841
MATT: What's your fly speed?

01:47:57.841 --> 01:48:05.468
MARISHA: My fly speed: 90 feet.

01:48:05.468 --> 01:48:09.614
MATT: Yeah, you can get to Percival. You could get
to a lot of places from here.

01:48:09.614 --> 01:48:14.338
MARISHA: How many rounds has it been? Do we know,
roughly?

01:48:14.338 --> 01:48:16.856
MATT: It's been nine rounds.

01:48:16.856 --> 01:48:20.745
MARISHA: Nine rounds. Then I'll use my last round
to--

01:48:20.745 --> 01:48:22.340
MATT: You have one more round--

01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:30.971
MARISHA: --of Sunbeam. This is my last round,
right? I'm going to fly directly above Percy.

01:48:30.971 --> 01:48:41.873
Looking down over top of him a good 60 feet almost
exactly and right below me going to do my Sunbeam

01:48:41.873 --> 01:48:43.486
down on top of his head.

01:48:43.486 --> 01:48:55.991
MATT: You also enter the healing column. I need
you to roll a constitution saving throw,

01:48:55.991 --> 01:48:57.189
Percival.

01:48:57.189 --> 01:48:58.854
LIAM: Like the satellite in Akira!

01:48:58.854 --> 01:49:05.369
TALIESIN: That's a constitutitution saving? Where's
my constitution? There we go.

01:49:05.369 --> 01:49:11.099
SAM: Pretty good!

01:49:11.099 --> 01:49:12.189
TALIESIN: 24.

01:49:12.189 --> 01:49:16.594
MARISHA: Fuck! Fucking no one did! Fucking
everyone!

01:49:16.594 --> 01:49:22.686
TRAVIS: Not me, I'm loving it. I've hit one
person.

01:49:22.686 --> 01:49:24.981
LIAM: I've hit zero persons.

01:49:24.981 --> 01:49:26.312
TRAVIS: I know.

01:49:26.312 --> 01:49:28.350
MARISHA: 25 damage.

01:49:28.350 --> 01:49:36.684
MATT: Halve that to 12. You take 12 points of
radiant damage, Percival, and you shield your eyes

01:49:36.684 --> 01:49:43.481
just in time as the blast hits you from above
to have it not affect your vision.

01:49:43.481 --> 01:49:44.931
TALIESIN: That ain't bad.

01:49:44.931 --> 01:49:48.633
MATT: You still have about 60 feet of movement if
you want, Keyleth.

01:49:48.633 --> 01:49:58.681
MARISHA: I'll fly that way to that corner.

01:49:58.681 --> 01:50:12.345
MATT: Staying that far up. You can't fly quite
that high up with this range because the ceiling

01:50:12.345 --> 01:50:13.783
is there.

01:50:13.783 --> 01:50:15.546
MARISHA: Don't look at me like that!

01:50:15.546 --> 01:50:19.332
TRAVIS: You don't have to make concentration
checks when you take damage, right? You just stay

01:50:19.332 --> 01:50:21.104
elemental. You're that.

01:50:21.104 --> 01:50:25.849
MARISHA: As the elemental, yes. It's my Sunbeam
that I've been rolling concentration checks

01:50:25.849 --> 01:50:26.749
against.

01:50:26.749 --> 01:50:27.591
TRAVIS: Gotcha.

01:50:27.591 --> 01:50:34.515
TALIESIN: She's got Cyclops laser until we hit her
hard enough. Hey, look who you can see now!

01:50:34.515 --> 01:50:39.857
MARISHA: I'm War Caster with pretty high wisdom,
so I'm trying to make it easier to not fail a

01:50:39.857 --> 01:50:41.204
concentration check.

01:50:41.204 --> 01:50:42.236
SAM: Oh Jesus!

01:50:42.236 --> 01:50:43.338
TALIESIN: Look who you see now!

01:50:43.338 --> 01:50:44.388
MARISHA: Oh, do I see Scanlan?

01:50:44.388 --> 01:50:47.757
MATT: You do now! As you float over, you see the
tiny little gnome, right there on the ground.

01:50:47.757 --> 01:50:49.293
TALIESIN: Good-bye.

01:50:49.293 --> 01:50:52.012
MARISHA: (helicopter imitation) LAPD! (helicopter
imitation)

01:50:52.012 --> 01:50:55.981
TALIESIN: Wow, that's a local joke right there!

01:50:55.981 --> 01:51:01.503
TRAVIS: It'll only be there for four and a half hours from
12:30 to 3:30.

01:51:01.503 --> 01:51:03.867
TALIESIN: They're already on their way in the
helicopter.

01:51:03.867 --> 01:51:05.492
MATT: End of your turn, Keyleth?

01:51:05.492 --> 01:51:07.017
MARISHA: Yeah, end of my turn.

01:51:07.017 --> 01:51:11.581
MATT: That ends Keyleth's turn and we're going to
go to a break because we're at a break point here.

01:51:11.581 --> 01:51:23.701
We'll come back here shortly to ensure that we
continue this roundabout battle of care and

01:51:23.701 --> 01:51:24.657
delicacy.

01:51:24.657 --> 01:51:25.894
LIAM: Battle of cowards!

01:51:25.894 --> 01:51:27.805
TALIESIN: I am proud of what I've done so far!

01:51:27.805 --> 01:51:29.131
LIAM: Same.

01:51:29.131 --> 01:51:33.368
MARISHA: I would like to say, I feel like I've been
playing pretty aggressively.

01:51:33.368 --> 01:51:39.388
MATT: You have been. You've been doing good. You
and Scanlan both have been doing pretty well.

01:51:39.388 --> 01:51:42.196
Grog's been going door-to-door salesman.

01:51:42.196 --> 01:51:44.746
LIAM: I have not lost a single hit point, Matt!

01:51:44.746 --> 01:51:46.017
MATT: You have not!

01:51:46.017 --> 01:51:47.447
TRAVIS: I've been looking for Vax!

01:51:47.447 --> 01:51:51.356
TALIESIN: I've been sniping the way I've always
wanted to. I feel like such a badass right now. I

01:51:51.356 --> 01:51:52.668
know it's going to end.

01:51:52.668 --> 01:51:56.806
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes after a
quick break, guys. At the break, we have our

01:51:56.806 --> 01:52:04.404
Wyrmwood giveaway. The keyword for this one is
"showdown." Put "showdown" in the chat room, one

01:52:04.404 --> 01:52:08.465
word, when you are prompted to be entered and
we'll come back with the winner after the break.

01:52:08.465 --> 01:52:10.522
See you guys here in a few minutes.

01:52:10.522 --> 02:10:40.844
[break]

02:10:40.936 --> 02:10:47.164
MATT: Welcome back, everybody. First off, we have
the winner in the chat for the black poisonwood

02:10:47.164 --> 02:10:51.690
Wyrmwood box, which I didn't have around to show
you at the time, but it's really pretty. The

02:10:51.690 --> 02:10:57.899
winner is CleverNameAlreadyTaken. Congratulations,
CleverNameAlreadyTaken. Danoba will get in contact

02:10:57.899 --> 02:11:01.677
with you and get your shipping information. We'll
get that out to you ASAP. Signed by the cast.

02:11:01.677 --> 02:11:14.241
Thank you again. So let's dive back into this
blood drizzle. You know.

02:11:14.241 --> 02:11:17.111
MARISHA: Waiting for that first blood. Waiting for
it.

02:11:17.111 --> 02:11:21.500
MATT: There's been a lot of first bloods, just no
consistent blood.

02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:24.215
LIAM: Guys, the Raven Queen took me out of here 20
minutes ago.

02:11:24.215 --> 02:11:28.913
MATT: You just find his equipment in the middle of
the battlefield.

02:11:28.913 --> 02:11:31.355
MARISHA: Oh, poor timing.

02:11:31.355 --> 02:11:33.538
LIAM: She gave me 20 minutes, she said.

02:11:33.538 --> 02:11:43.505
MATT: Top of the round, Percival. First off, you
heal 20 hit points as your turn begins inside the

02:11:43.505 --> 02:11:50.506
column of green light atop the tower. And it's
your turn.

02:11:50.506 --> 02:11:56.662
TALIESIN: I'm going to shoot the lock. I'm going
to get within ten feet of that lock so that

02:11:56.662 --> 02:11:59.711
there's no sound and I'm going to shoot the lock
open.

02:11:59.711 --> 02:12:01.683
MATT: Make an attack roll.

02:12:01.683 --> 02:12:09.995
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Retort for this just
because I don't want to waste anything worthwhile.

02:12:09.995 --> 02:12:13.885
30 to hit.

02:12:13.885 --> 02:12:16.265
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll damage.

02:12:16.265 --> 02:12:20.042
TALIESIN: All right. Where's my fancy--? There we
are. That's ten points of damage.

02:12:20.042 --> 02:12:27.937
MATT: Okay. The lock splinters and the trapdoor
falls open.

02:12:27.937 --> 02:12:36.019
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to run inside and
perch on the ceiling. I'm going to use my Spider

02:12:36.019 --> 02:12:38.001
Climb boots. And what do I see around?

02:12:38.001 --> 02:12:43.962
MATT: Okay, as soon as you rush to the stairs you
can see there's a bit of fog on the inside of the

02:12:43.962 --> 02:12:50.891
chamber. It fills the room and obscures a lot of
the interior. So you move up onto the ceiling and

02:12:50.891 --> 02:12:53.887
you're now underneath, inside the chamber.

02:12:53.887 --> 02:12:55.746
TALIESIN: I don't see anything?

02:12:55.746 --> 02:13:05.155
MATT: You are, for the purposes of this,
upside-down there.

02:13:05.155 --> 02:13:10.264
TALIESIN: Sure. I'm going to hide-- and those
stairs keep going down?

02:13:10.264 --> 02:13:14.737
MATT: They do. You have 15 more movement if you
want.

02:13:14.737 --> 02:13:17.137
TALIESIN: I'm going to go down to the next level.

02:13:17.137 --> 02:13:21.529
MATT: You don't have quite enough movement to get
there. You get just to the top of the stairway

02:13:21.529 --> 02:13:25.075
onto the ceiling. We'll put you there for the sake
of keeping track of it.

02:13:25.075 --> 02:13:28.661
TALIESIN: Can I see down there at all?

02:13:28.661 --> 02:13:31.234
MATT: Yeah, the fog kind of dissipates below.

02:13:31.234 --> 02:13:40.391
TALIESIN: Oh, in that case I'm not going to get
that close if I can't get all the way there

02:13:40.391 --> 02:13:45.980
anyway. So I'm going to get right in that little
corner there and keep an eye out.

02:13:45.980 --> 02:13:47.399
MATT: Well, to look down the stairs you'd have to
get--

02:13:47.399 --> 02:13:50.720
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I was going to say, I have to
get to the other side of the fog? I don't have

02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:52.328
enough movement to get back from the fog, then?

02:13:52.328 --> 02:13:55.453
MATT: Well, you're in the fog still but I mean, it
dissipates down the stairs. The whole chamber's

02:13:55.453 --> 02:13:56.664
still filled with fog.

02:13:56.664 --> 02:13:59.217
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to stay in the fog and
keep an eye on what's down there.

02:13:59.217 --> 02:14:07.272
MATT: Okay. Boop. All righty. That ends Percival's
turn. Scanlan, you're up.

02:14:07.272 --> 02:14:09.651
SAM: Bonus action: Healing Word.

02:14:09.651 --> 02:14:11.815
TALIESIN: Wow, you are not rolling those well.

02:14:11.815 --> 02:14:15.737
MATT: You have an air elemental swirling 80 feet
above you.

02:14:15.737 --> 02:14:18.743
SAM: Yep. I just sang a little song to myself.

02:14:18.743 --> 02:14:22.166
TALIESIN: I've softened him up for you.

02:14:22.166 --> 02:14:35.593
SAM: Okay, so for all who care, I'm up to 63. And
I'm going to look at Keyleth, say into my earring,

02:14:35.593 --> 02:14:46.806
Friends, let's go fucking kill Vax. At least find
him! This is not a fair fight without him! And

02:14:46.806 --> 02:14:49.404
then I will Dimension Door to the opposite corner
again.

02:14:49.404 --> 02:14:52.273
MARISHA: Oh, good call!

02:14:52.273 --> 02:14:59.905
MATT: Keyleth, you hear his cry into the earring
and watch as, in a flash of vibrant pink-purple

02:14:59.905 --> 02:15:04.303
energy, he steps through a small, magic-made
doorway and vanishes from your sight.

02:15:04.303 --> 02:15:06.856
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay.

02:15:06.856 --> 02:15:08.588
TRAVIS: Anti-gravity still going?

02:15:08.588 --> 02:15:15.646
SAM: Oh yeah. Whose turn?

02:15:15.646 --> 02:15:24.305
MATT: That ends Scanlan's turn. That brings us to
Grog. Sorry. Top of the round, now the exterior of

02:15:24.305 --> 02:15:29.584
the tower bursts into flames. Fire climbs up and
incinerates the island around the central tower,

02:15:29.584 --> 02:15:32.340
to no effect currently. Grog, your turn.

02:15:32.340 --> 02:15:36.970
TRAVIS: Can I turn around, since my magic pedestal
has not done anything for me, and go through the

02:15:36.970 --> 02:15:38.383
portal, please?

02:15:38.383 --> 02:15:40.704
TALIESIN: Also, by the way, you see Scanlan as
well.

02:15:40.704 --> 02:15:43.601
SAM: Hello! Bye-bye!

02:15:43.601 --> 02:15:48.186
MATT: Ten, 15. You're now inside.

02:15:48.186 --> 02:15:50.956
TRAVIS: Can I keep going straight across?

02:15:50.956 --> 02:15:55.689
MATT: 50. You're about knee-deep in the water.

02:15:55.689 --> 02:16:01.507
TRAVIS: Can I use my Boots of Feral Leaping to
leap horizontally 20 feet?

02:16:01.507 --> 02:16:03.638
MATT: Go for it. Well, make the athletics check.

02:16:03.638 --> 02:16:08.808
TRAVIS: 17.

02:16:08.808 --> 02:16:16.724
MATT: 17, yeah. You just crest onto the edge. Your
ankle's kind of at the edge of the water. That's it.

02:16:16.724 --> 02:16:25.866
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck it. Can I use my dash to go
inside the tower from the bottom door?

02:16:25.866 --> 02:16:27.092
MATT: You may.

02:16:27.092 --> 02:16:28.186
TALIESIN: Yeah!

02:16:28.186 --> 02:16:31.787
SAM: Has he hit the anti-gravity field yet?

02:16:31.787 --> 02:16:41.352
MATT: Just as you get to the edge of that, I need
you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving

02:16:41.352 --> 02:16:42.268
throw.

02:16:42.268 --> 02:16:46.907
TRAVIS: Well, that's my game. Yeah, no. Seven.

02:16:46.907 --> 02:16:50.877
SAM: I didn't know you were even there!

02:16:50.877 --> 02:16:54.435
TRAVIS: I wasn't there. I thought it was put over
on that side of the tower.

02:16:54.435 --> 02:17:03.242
MATT: So Grog, as you go--

02:17:03.242 --> 02:17:10.271
SAM: Unintended consequences. Don't worry, I'll
get rid of it on the next round-- oh wait. You'll

02:17:10.271 --> 02:17:12.118
plummet to your death.

02:17:12.118 --> 02:17:13.670
TALIESIN: Oh no, he'll survive.

02:17:13.670 --> 02:17:15.861
TRAVIS: I can't do much but hit things, so you
know.

02:17:15.861 --> 02:17:25.461
MATT: For the purposes of this here, that puts it
about fair. Grog, you go flying up into the sky,

02:17:25.461 --> 02:17:30.975
past the edge of the tower, slamming into the
ceiling over the battlefield. I need you to make a

02:17:30.975 --> 02:17:32.318
constitution saving throw.

02:17:32.318 --> 02:17:34.889
TRAVIS: Yes. 31.

02:17:34.889 --> 02:17:43.869
MATT: 31, you succeed. So you take what would've
been 21 points of force damage, reduced to ten.

02:17:43.869 --> 02:17:52.117
And you do not bounce off to return-- you manage
to stop yourself, but you're still about to be

02:17:52.117 --> 02:17:58.090
forced back into it. You don't get pushed off, but
the gravity's still pushing you into it. So each

02:17:58.090 --> 02:18:03.858
round you're up there, you're going to keep taking
this damage. All righty. That finishes Grog's

02:18:03.858 --> 02:18:07.685
turn. All right. Mr. Stealthy Pants?

02:18:07.685 --> 02:18:10.107
MARISHA: Stealthy Pants McGee.

02:18:10.107 --> 02:18:12.529
SAM: Can you only send him moves in gif form?

02:18:12.529 --> 02:18:19.872
LIAM: How did you know that's what I was doing?
This is that kid in the GoCart chair that spins

02:18:19.872 --> 02:18:21.421
and spins and spins.

02:18:21.421 --> 02:18:24.231
SAM: Sure, sure. I'm going to do a Mr. Bean
followed by a--

02:18:24.231 --> 02:18:26.771
MARISHA: Followed by a Homer Simpson into the
bushes.

02:18:26.771 --> 02:18:37.406
Followed by that kid that's like "Oh
shit!" as he runs by.

02:18:37.406 --> 02:18:44.486
MATT: Here's the thing, and I'm being fair in this
circumstance. Keyleth and Grog, out of the corner

02:18:44.486 --> 02:18:49.945
of your eye, you see a dash of black, winged
movement as, darting from the edge of this tower,

02:18:49.945 --> 02:18:57.774
you see something out the side of this tower, like
climbing on the outside, dart and then vanish in

02:18:57.774 --> 02:18:59.180
that direction.

02:18:59.180 --> 02:19:00.946
TALIESIN: Wow.

02:19:00.946 --> 02:19:03.443
LIAM: You don't know that.

02:19:03.443 --> 02:19:04.635
TALIESIN: I don't know shit.

02:19:04.635 --> 02:19:08.983
MARISHA: How &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; you get up the tower?

02:19:08.983 --> 02:19:11.423
TRAVIS: He didn't go in the tower. He just climbed
up the side.

02:19:11.423 --> 02:19:18.709
LIAM: Her miniature is facing that way. His
miniature is facing that way. I'm being a shit.

02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:19.830
MATT: You want to fight me on this?

02:19:19.830 --> 02:19:28.806
LIAM: Not at all. I started this game knowing that
Marisha was going to kill me. Ooh.

02:19:28.806 --> 02:19:33.288
MATT: Early bird gets an early grave. All righty.
That brings us to--

02:19:33.288 --> 02:19:35.023
MARISHA: I'm trying so hard.

02:19:35.023 --> 02:19:36.331
MATT: Keyleth.

02:19:36.331 --> 02:19:42.687
MARISHA: Okay, so Grog is suspended, being
repeatedly beaten into the ceiling?

02:19:42.687 --> 02:19:46.401
TALIESIN: Vibrated to death.

02:19:46.401 --> 02:19:53.044
MATT: Yeah, right now-- You didn't bounce off but
now you're slammed into it and being slowly pushed

02:19:53.044 --> 02:19:54.775
into it, like (static crackling).

02:19:54.775 --> 02:19:57.912
TRAVIS: Good times.

02:19:57.912 --> 02:20:04.021
MARISHA: And I saw a black streak go this
direction?

02:20:04.021 --> 02:20:07.770
MATT: From this wall to behind where the edge of
this building, and then vanish.

02:20:07.770 --> 02:20:13.670
MARISHA: And I know Percy's somewhere in the
tower, but I don't know where?

02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:14.768
MATT: Correct.

02:20:14.768 --> 02:20:28.457
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah. Let me just try and find
people. I'm going to fly over top of where that is

02:20:28.457 --> 02:20:36.886
and see if I can see anything. I'm going to look
for a stealthy Vax. How much movement was that?

02:20:36.886 --> 02:20:51.929
MATT: That would've been-- oh god. Knocked you
over. Actually, as far as you can get is there.

02:20:51.929 --> 02:20:55.579
MARISHA: Okay. Do I see anything from my awesome
aerial perspective?

02:20:55.579 --> 02:21:00.532
MATT: You do not. There's the open door to the
building and there's the circular thing over there

02:21:00.532 --> 02:21:01.864
but that's all you can see.

02:21:01.864 --> 02:21:03.223
SAM: He could be somewhere over there.

02:21:03.223 --> 02:21:07.918
LIAM and TALIESIN: (singing) Somewhere out there.

02:21:07.918 --> 02:21:12.222
LIAM: I'll fucking shank your ass!

02:21:12.222 --> 02:21:14.233
MATT: Keyleth?

02:21:14.233 --> 02:21:21.831
MARISHA: Can I use the rest of my action to move
down? To just move?

02:21:21.831 --> 02:21:23.582
MATT: Where do you want to move?

02:21:23.582 --> 02:21:29.415
MARISHA: Let me drop down 60 feet. Or half my
movement speed or something like that, right?

02:21:29.415 --> 02:21:31.718
MATT: Yeah, so you'd be about, let's say--

02:21:31.718 --> 02:21:38.639
SAM: Matt, could I see her, by the way, when she
flew over and down like that?

02:21:38.639 --> 02:21:46.737
MATT: Yeah, you saw her coast over and downward.
So there you go. That's your turn.

02:21:46.737 --> 02:21:47.842
MARISHA: That's my turn.

02:21:47.842 --> 02:21:49.158
MATT: All right, Percival, you're up.

02:21:49.158 --> 02:21:51.434
TALIESIN: I'm going to go the next level down, see
what I see.

02:21:51.434 --> 02:21:55.861
MATT: Okay. The fog has now begun to dissipate
from the entire chamber.

02:21:55.861 --> 02:22:03.134
LIAM: It's like ten minutes. I'm going to check. I
could be wrong because I don't know shit.

02:22:03.134 --> 02:22:04.762
MATT: You might be right. I was just guessing.

02:22:04.762 --> 02:22:05.765
MARISHA: Did you make fog?

02:22:05.765 --> 02:22:08.965
LIAM: No! Yes.

02:22:08.965 --> 02:22:10.750
TRAVIS: Do you want to tell us anything you did?

02:22:10.750 --> 02:22:11.975
LIAM: I didn't play this game.

02:22:11.975 --> 02:22:15.271
TALIESIN: I'm just heading down, scanning, heading
down, scanning, and looking for anything.

02:22:15.271 --> 02:22:16.491
LIAM: One hour.

02:22:16.491 --> 02:22:19.278
MATT: Oh yeah, then never mind. It dissipates
because you step out of it.

02:22:19.278 --> 02:22:21.251
LIAM: I'm a druid, yo.

02:22:21.251 --> 02:22:23.019
TALIESIN: Fuck, I forgot that.

02:22:23.019 --> 02:22:24.416
MARISHA: Did you do Fog Cloud?

02:22:24.416 --> 02:22:25.649
LIAM: Yeah, baby!

02:22:25.649 --> 02:22:33.429
MATT: Heading down, there's no furniture, just the
stairway. It looks like the interior of this has

02:22:33.429 --> 02:22:39.403
been either unfurnished or cleared out. It's just
a series of empty stairs that lead up and down the

02:22:39.403 --> 02:22:40.380
tower.

02:22:40.380 --> 02:22:44.719
TALIESIN: I'm going to get all the way to the
bottom, then, and back myself against that bottom

02:22:44.719 --> 02:22:50.505
door and I'm going to push all the way to the
bottom of the tower with my movement.

02:22:50.505 --> 02:22:52.794
MATT: Okay. That's your whole turn?

02:22:52.794 --> 02:22:57.776
TALIESIN: I was hoping there'd be a person in
there. I mean, that's all my movement, isn't it?

02:22:57.865 --> 02:23:03.933
And that's all my action to move that as well,
right? Yep, I ran down that tower going, I want to

02:23:03.933 --> 02:23:05.041
fight everybody!

02:23:05.041 --> 02:23:06.970
LIAM: Good boy. Not metagaming.

02:23:06.970 --> 02:23:11.279
MARISHA: Ooh, the m-word.

02:23:11.279 --> 02:23:14.674
MATT: Finishing Percy's turn, Scanlan.

02:23:14.674 --> 02:23:20.711
SAM: My turn? Jesus Christ, I don't know what to
do. I only see Keyleth. I've only seen Keyleth

02:23:20.711 --> 02:23:24.789
this whole game! Do I see Grog up there, flying?

02:23:24.789 --> 02:23:26.537
MATT: Yeah, you see Grog up there bouncing.

02:23:26.537 --> 02:23:29.187
MARISHA: And Percy shot you!

02:23:29.187 --> 02:23:33.810
TALIESIN: I'm of the opinion that, against the
wall, I don't think he sees him right now.

02:23:33.810 --> 02:23:35.617
MATT: Right now, no, but if you were to look
around.

02:23:35.617 --> 02:23:38.741
TALIESIN: If you were to back off a bit,
you would see him, maybe.

02:23:38.741 --> 02:23:40.047
SAM: Okay, I will peek around the corner.

02:23:40.047 --> 02:23:44.929
MATT: Okay, so you move five feet, glance over,
and you see Grog currently being jammed up into

02:23:44.929 --> 02:23:46.242
the ceiling.

02:23:46.242 --> 02:23:50.727
SAM: I kind of know where Keyleth is. I kind of
know where Grog is. No one has responded to my

02:23:50.727 --> 02:23:54.046
text message of "Let's go find Vax."

02:23:54.046 --> 02:24:04.538
TALIESIN: Sorry, new earring, who's this? Thank
you for being the only person who really laughed

02:24:04.538 --> 02:24:07.414
at my good joke. That was a very good joke. Chat
probably liked it.

02:24:07.414 --> 02:24:10.825
SAM: Bonus action Healing Word. Oh wait, wrong
one.

02:24:10.825 --> 02:24:17.243
MARISHA: He's going to use all of his spells to
just Healing Word. 1d4 at a time.

02:24:17.243 --> 02:24:18.610
MATT: Just slowly build it back up.

02:24:18.610 --> 02:24:20.926
TALIESIN: And I will take it all away again next
time I see him.

02:24:20.926 --> 02:24:27.016
SAM: Jesus, I don't know what to do. I'm not going
to go after Keyleth without backup.

02:24:27.016 --> 02:24:33.203
MARISHA: No, but here. I'm going after Vax too! Ba
ra ra!

02:24:33.203 --> 02:24:34.537
SAM: You don't speak English!

02:24:34.537 --> 02:24:36.012
MATT: Well, technically she can.

02:24:36.012 --> 02:24:41.943
MARISHA: Oh wait, we decided I can because it's
telepathic. I'm trying to find my boyfriend! He

02:24:41.943 --> 02:24:46.231
fucking ditched me at this bar! Fucking asshole!

02:24:46.231 --> 02:24:53.459
SAM: All right. So I'm going to announce to
everyone, I am going to search for Vax! Hold your

02:24:53.459 --> 02:25:01.372
fire! And I'll walk, I guess, around this thing.
Can I get around it without--?

02:25:01.372 --> 02:25:03.834
MATT: You can get 25 feet.

02:25:03.834 --> 02:25:07.877
SAM: Actually, no, I don't know where he is at
all.

02:25:07.877 --> 02:25:12.462
MATT: You see her floating. After Keyleth tells
you that, she's over here, moving down this way.

02:25:12.462 --> 02:25:13.723
That's all you know.

02:25:13.723 --> 02:25:15.588
LIAM: Baby, are you saving a Wish for me?

02:25:15.588 --> 02:25:17.059
SAM: Yeah.

02:25:17.059 --> 02:25:23.958
MARISHA: Oh, your &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; boyfriend? Okay.

02:25:23.958 --> 02:25:26.106
LIAM: That's another universe.

02:25:26.106 --> 02:25:28.686
MATT: One's in-game, one's out-of-game.

02:25:28.686 --> 02:25:30.990
MARISHA: Oh sure. Sorry.

02:25:30.990 --> 02:25:32.611
LIAM: One's real, Marisha. One's real.

02:25:32.611 --> 02:25:39.482
SAM: All right. I'm going to start going this
way.

02:25:39.482 --> 02:25:42.468
MATT: You get that far, less than that, even.

02:25:42.468 --> 02:25:46.162
SAM: I'll use dash to keep going.

02:25:46.162 --> 02:25:51.791
MATT: You can get about there. Tiny gnomish legs.

02:25:51.791 --> 02:25:55.192
MARISHA: This is a big-ass map.

02:25:55.192 --> 02:26:00.462
TALIESIN: This is such a big map! I love it! It
makes me very dangerous.

02:26:00.462 --> 02:26:08.379
MATT: Beginning of Grog's turn, you watch the
lightning towers spark and then fire off radius.

02:26:08.379 --> 02:26:10.522
Nobody's there. Grog, you're up.

02:26:10.522 --> 02:26:12.248
SAM: Really, no one's near the lightning towers?

02:26:12.248 --> 02:26:15.588
TRAVIS: Getting bug zapped.

02:26:15.588 --> 02:26:17.548
MATT: Make another constitution saving throw,
please.

02:26:17.548 --> 02:26:22.895
TRAVIS: Big southern mosquito. 30! 18 plus 12.

02:26:22.895 --> 02:26:26.723
MATT: You succeed. So you take 12 points of force
damage.

02:26:26.723 --> 02:26:29.974
TRAVIS: Dear god. That's already halved, right?

02:26:29.974 --> 02:26:30.996
MATT: Yes.

02:26:30.996 --> 02:26:32.442
TRAVIS: Okay, cool.

02:26:32.442 --> 02:26:37.255
SAM: I guess I could have dropped Anti-Gravity. I
forgot.

02:26:37.255 --> 02:26:45.552
TRAVIS: You did? Cool. With my bonus action, can I
use my Second Wind to heal 1d10 plus my stupid-ass

02:26:45.656 --> 02:26:46.617
fighter level?

02:26:46.703 --> 02:26:47.751
MATT: Go for it.

02:26:47.751 --> 02:26:51.956
SAM: You want me to get rid of it?

02:26:51.956 --> 02:26:56.048
TRAVIS: I'm fucking up here until you don't!

02:26:56.048 --> 02:27:01.247
SAM: I forgot, I'm sorry! Can I do it now, Matt?
No.

02:27:01.247 --> 02:27:03.120
TRAVIS: It's cool, I'm up there.

02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:04.896
SAM: It's fine.

02:27:04.896 --> 02:27:13.340
TRAVIS: I'm going to get the immovable rod out in
my hand, waiting to fall.

02:27:13.340 --> 02:27:19.054
MATT: You've got the immovable rod out and you're
clutching it. So you're holding your action on it?

02:27:19.054 --> 02:27:27.666
TRAVIS: I'll hold my action if someone comes
within striking range. Can I say that?

02:27:27.666 --> 02:27:31.872
MATT: Are you holding your attack or--

02:27:31.872 --> 02:27:36.911
TRAVIS: An action, not an attack. My action so I
can click the rod.

02:27:36.911 --> 02:27:43.927
LIAM: I sent a question, and here comes a second
question. Here it comes.

02:27:43.927 --> 02:27:46.294
MATT: You're on deck, Keyleth.

02:27:46.294 --> 02:27:48.636
TALIESIN: Sorry, my fault. Hi.

02:27:48.636 --> 02:28:03.743
LIAM: Got it. Okay. I'm good. So you know what I
want to do. I did it already.

02:28:03.743 --> 02:28:05.679
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

02:28:05.679 --> 02:28:10.780
LIAM: Hey man, I worked really hard for 115
episodes. Allow me to be a fuckoff.

02:28:10.780 --> 02:28:14.928
MARISHA: I'm going to look around. No sign of Vax,
I'm assuming.

02:28:14.928 --> 02:28:16.146
MATT: From where you currently stand, no.

02:28:16.146 --> 02:28:26.546
MARISHA: Scanlan, he's too fucking stealthy! I'm
going to go punk Grog. And then I'm going to fly

02:28:26.546 --> 02:28:30.007
up within 60 feet of him.

02:28:30.007 --> 02:28:31.994
SAM: You just gave up?

02:28:31.994 --> 02:28:34.598
MARISHA: I can't find him! I looked!

02:28:34.598 --> 02:28:37.110
SAM: For legitimately six seconds.

02:28:37.110 --> 02:28:41.437
TRAVIS: I'm literally the helium balloon in the
grocery store that broke away from the cashier and

02:28:41.437 --> 02:28:43.065
is fucking sitting up there.

02:28:43.065 --> 02:28:44.739
TALIESIN: You're going on an adventure!

02:28:44.739 --> 02:28:47.688
MARISHA: He's not going to let me do another
perception check! I tried!

02:28:47.688 --> 02:28:49.757
LIAM: It's the best! Until I die.

02:28:49.757 --> 02:28:59.188
MARISHA: I'm going to go up and be like: Sorry,
Grog! And hit him with a Blight spell. Let's say

02:28:59.188 --> 02:29:00.237
level--

02:29:00.237 --> 02:29:01.897
LIAM: That's going to shoot off your pinky toe,
man!

02:29:01.897 --> 02:29:03.512
TRAVIS: I've got another one of those.

02:29:03.512 --> 02:29:06.541
MARISHA: Let's say a level five Blight.

02:29:06.541 --> 02:29:09.996
MATT: Grog, make a constitution saving throw,
please.

02:29:09.996 --> 02:29:13.676
LIAM: Man, next campaign you're not going to be a
meat sponge like this.

02:29:13.676 --> 02:29:15.146
TRAVIS: I won't be. 18.

02:29:15.146 --> 02:29:18.465
MATT: 18, that's a failure. So full damage of
Blight on Grog.

02:29:18.465 --> 02:29:22.462
TRAVIS: Whatever it is, I'll use my Stone's
Endurance.

02:29:22.462 --> 02:29:26.932
LIAM: God, when you play your aasimar ranger, it's
going to be so weird.

02:29:26.932 --> 02:29:33.696
TRAVIS: Yeah. I don't know what that first word
you said is. Aasimar?

02:29:33.696 --> 02:29:38.282
LIAM: Your kenku druid.

02:29:38.282 --> 02:29:41.181
TRAVIS: My tabaxi tortle.

02:29:41.181 --> 02:29:45.553
LIAM: Tabaxi tortle half-breed bard. Yeah.

02:29:45.553 --> 02:29:48.540
MATT: I multi-raced a little since I leveled up.

02:29:48.540 --> 02:29:51.595
LIAM: Tabaxi with a shell.

02:29:51.595 --> 02:29:54.123
MATT: Someone please draw that.

02:29:54.123 --> 02:30:03.504
MARISHA: 49 points of necrotic damage.

02:30:03.504 --> 02:30:16.290
TRAVIS: Let me roll my Stone's Endurance. Ten plus
my constitution. Minus 16. So 41 minus 16 would be

02:30:16.290 --> 02:30:20.127
25.

02:30:20.127 --> 02:30:22.673
MARISHA: Where'd that minus 16 go?

02:30:22.673 --> 02:30:24.266
TRAVIS: My Stone's Endurance.

02:30:24.266 --> 02:30:25.742
MATT: Wait, how much damage was it?

02:30:25.742 --> 02:30:27.295
MARISHA: 49.

02:30:27.295 --> 02:30:32.410
MATT: Oh, 49. Sorry, minus 16. So it'd be 33.

02:30:32.410 --> 02:30:34.961
MARISHA: 42 plus seven is 49, right?

02:30:34.961 --> 02:30:45.225
MATT: Keyleth, he screams out in pain as he's
being pushed into the ceiling. His veins bulge

02:30:45.225 --> 02:30:47.743
with black energy as the Blight takes hold.

02:30:47.743 --> 02:30:48.968
TRAVIS: Not cool!

02:30:48.968 --> 02:30:51.440
MARISHA: Sorry!

02:30:51.440 --> 02:30:52.872
TRAVIS: No, you're not.

02:30:52.872 --> 02:30:57.440
MATT: You're about 50 feet of movement left.

02:30:57.440 --> 02:31:08.065
MARISHA: Next is the blue, so let me go to that
back corner a bit more. That's good.

02:31:08.065 --> 02:31:12.516
MATT: There you are. Ending Keyleth's turn, Percy,
you're up.

02:31:12.516 --> 02:31:28.238
TALIESIN: I'm going to exit out the door and I'm
going to take a run back over here. This way.

02:31:28.238 --> 02:31:32.114
(counting)

02:31:32.114 --> 02:31:34.761
MATT: 30, if you wanted to get there.

02:31:34.761 --> 02:31:36.692
SAM: Are you jumping across the river?

02:31:36.692 --> 02:31:40.430
TALIESIN: I don't even know if I'm actually
jumping?

02:31:40.430 --> 02:31:46.354
SAM: Does he have to leave the ground to jump
across?

02:31:46.354 --> 02:31:48.213
TALIESIN: I was actually going to walk, to be
fair.

02:31:48.213 --> 02:31:51.672
MARISHA and TALIESIN: I see what you're doing.

02:31:51.672 --> 02:31:54.509
TALIESIN: Am I in the range of it at that point?

02:31:54.509 --> 02:31:56.612
MATT: I don't know, are you?

02:31:56.612 --> 02:31:58.478
TALIESIN: Where's the--?

02:31:58.478 --> 02:32:00.968
MATT: You don't know. You didn't see.

02:32:00.968 --> 02:32:05.808
TALIESIN: I was planning on walking, but I'm fine
either way. If you make a roll for it, I'll make a

02:32:05.808 --> 02:32:06.987
dex roll.

02:32:06.987 --> 02:32:08.482
MATT: Make a dex roll.

02:32:08.482 --> 02:32:17.300
TALIESIN: It's a dex save? All right. 19?

02:32:17.300 --> 02:32:18.852
MATT: No.

02:32:18.852 --> 02:32:21.488
TALIESIN: Was it not? Just for fun, let's burn--

02:32:21.488 --> 02:32:23.051
MATT: Indomitable?

02:32:23.051 --> 02:32:26.871
TALIESIN: Let's burn a resolve.

02:32:26.871 --> 02:32:28.961
MATT: Indomitable you mean, right?

02:32:28.961 --> 02:32:32.301
TALIESIN: It's reroll a save?

02:32:32.301 --> 02:32:33.515
MATT: Yeah.

02:32:33.515 --> 02:32:41.876
TALIESIN: I wrote it down weirdly because I was
trying to conserve space. Yeah, no.

02:32:41.876 --> 02:32:44.511
TRAVIS: I have a playmate!

02:32:44.511 --> 02:33:04.024
MATT: Percival, you go firing up into the ceiling
as you attempt to make your way across the river.

02:33:04.024 --> 02:33:12.251
Technically, you're one higher than that, but
that's fine. Make a constitution saving throw as

02:33:12.251 --> 02:33:13.843
you get thrust up.

02:33:13.843 --> 02:33:23.745
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw. (counting)
24.

02:33:23.745 --> 02:33:35.812
MATT: That's a success. You suffer 21 halved to
ten points of force damage. You and Grog are now

02:33:35.812 --> 02:33:39.961
within visual range of each other, being pushed
into the force field ceiling.

02:33:39.961 --> 02:33:45.746
TALIESIN: I still have my action. There's no way I
can use spider climb on the force wall, is there?

02:33:45.746 --> 02:33:48.047
MATT: You can certainly try.

02:33:48.047 --> 02:33:50.049
TALIESIN: Oh, I have to roll concentration.

02:33:50.049 --> 02:33:51.507
MATT: You do.

02:33:51.507 --> 02:33:53.122
SAM: For what?

02:33:53.122 --> 02:33:56.621
TALIESIN: The silence spell. What is that?

02:33:56.621 --> 02:34:00.085
MATT: That's a constitution saving throw.

02:34:00.085 --> 02:34:02.753
TALIESIN: Okay, same thing. 16?

02:34:02.753 --> 02:34:05.931
MATT: 16 succeeds. It's a DC ten.

02:34:05.931 --> 02:34:15.918
TALIESIN: This is interesting.

02:34:15.918 --> 02:34:18.347
MATT: It is. What are you going to do?

02:34:18.347 --> 02:34:20.191
SAM: We're all flying now.

02:34:20.191 --> 02:34:29.056
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and right myself and see
if I can put my boots on and walk on the ceiling.

02:34:29.056 --> 02:34:38.228
MATT: As your feet touch the surface, they find
some purchase. It's like walking on a water bed.

02:34:38.228 --> 02:34:45.351
They seem to be holding somewhat, but that's the
full of your movement.

02:34:45.351 --> 02:34:49.240
TRAVIS: That's fascinating. Those boots are
ridiculous.

02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:50.710
SAM: Water bed.

02:34:50.710 --> 02:34:52.422
TALIESIN: That'll do.

02:34:52.422 --> 02:34:55.217
MARISHA: Remember when there were water beds? Good
times.

02:34:55.217 --> 02:34:56.690
TALIESIN: Those were such a pain in the ass.

02:34:56.690 --> 02:34:58.098
MARISHA: Terrible for your back.

02:34:58.098 --> 02:34:59.712
MATT: Scanlan, it's your turn.

02:34:59.712 --> 02:35:12.929
SAM: I'm still walking across this room as fast as
my little feets can carry me. And I'm kind of out

02:35:12.929 --> 02:35:15.376
of low-level spells at this point.

02:35:15.376 --> 02:35:18.380
MATT: You can cast it at a higher level, it
just--

02:35:18.380 --> 02:35:21.024
SAM: But it won't be a bonus action anymore, will
it?

02:35:21.024 --> 02:35:22.637
MARISHA: 9th-level Healing Word. Do it.

02:35:22.637 --> 02:35:26.250
SAM: Can I do a bonus action at a higher level if
I don't do a spell for my action?

02:35:26.250 --> 02:35:30.038
MATT: You could sacrifice a higher-level spell
slot to cast a level two Healing Word as a bonus

02:35:30.038 --> 02:35:31.174
action.

02:35:31.174 --> 02:35:33.944
SAM: Ugh. Wow.

02:35:33.944 --> 02:35:36.813
MATT: But you'd lose a higher-level spell slot
with only getting the bonuses of a level two

02:35:36.813 --> 02:35:39.999
spell. That I'll allow.

02:35:39.999 --> 02:35:49.864
SAM: That is insane. I will not do that yet. No,
I'll do that. I'm so down. Okay. Oh yeah.

02:35:49.864 --> 02:35:51.379
MATT: What level do you use?

02:35:51.379 --> 02:35:57.048
SAM: Level three. So that heals me another 12
points. Yeah man.

02:35:57.048 --> 02:36:00.681
MATT: So that's your turn?

02:36:00.681 --> 02:36:07.666
SAM: That's my bonus action. Then I'll use my
action to sneak out and look-- Oh wait! I can get

02:36:07.666 --> 02:36:13.704
out and around back here, right? I'll do that. And
when I get out the door I'm looking around. What

02:36:13.704 --> 02:36:15.995
do I see? I see everybody floating in the air?
This is crazy.

02:36:15.995 --> 02:36:21.526
MATT: You see Keyleth over here. Both Grog and
Percival being held against the forcefield.

02:36:21.526 --> 02:36:26.445
Percival seems to have righted himself and his
feet are actually affixed to the field and now is

02:36:26.445 --> 02:36:29.271
walking, trying to move across it.

02:36:29.271 --> 02:36:36.120
SAM: Do I let them go? I need help finding Vax,
but I don't even know if they're on my side right

02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:37.856
now! They haven't responded to my text!

02:36:37.856 --> 02:36:39.592
TRAVIS: We're on your side! Let me down!

02:36:39.592 --> 02:36:41.972
SAM: Okay, then I'm going to release the gravity.

02:36:41.972 --> 02:36:47.813
MATT: Okay. And with that, the gravity subsides.

02:36:47.813 --> 02:36:50.157
TALIESIN: Do I fall?

02:36:50.157 --> 02:36:59.634
MATT: No, you are held aloft. Grog, however,
plummets to the ground for 80 feet.

02:36:59.634 --> 02:37:04.184
TRAVIS: Do I get to use the action to hit the
button on the rod somewhere?

02:37:04.184 --> 02:37:09.485
MATT: As a reaction, you do. Where do you hit the
rod? At what height?

02:37:09.485 --> 02:37:11.873
TRAVIS: I'll hit it at 20 feet above the ground.

02:37:11.873 --> 02:37:13.248
MATT: 20 feet above the ground.

02:37:13.248 --> 02:37:17.011
TRAVIS: Making that Halo dive.

02:37:17.011 --> 02:37:25.527
MATT: Grog, make a strength check. I'm working on
it. Don't worry.

02:37:25.527 --> 02:37:31.188
TRAVIS: 27.

02:37:31.188 --> 02:37:36.613
MATT: 27, yeah. You manage to hold tight. Your
muscles strain from the falling impact of catching

02:37:36.613 --> 02:37:37.842
yourself there.

02:37:37.842 --> 02:37:39.747
LIAM: Does he immediately start doing one-arm
pushups?

02:37:39.747 --> 02:37:46.303
MATT: Essentially, yeah. You suffer one point of
damage. Rolled a one on that one. From just muscle

02:37:46.303 --> 02:37:47.594
strain.

02:37:47.594 --> 02:37:49.937
TRAVIS: But the muscle's going to get that much
bigger.

02:37:49.937 --> 02:37:55.505
MATT: No, it is. The muscle kind of pops out of
the socket and you wrench it back in with the

02:37:55.505 --> 02:37:57.644
sheer force of your shoulder and back muscles.

02:37:57.644 --> 02:37:59.155
LIAM: Micro-tears!

02:37:59.155 --> 02:38:07.941
MATT: All right, Scanlan. That's your turn? All
right. That brings us to Grog. First and foremost,

02:38:07.941 --> 02:38:15.919
you watch as the rooms flash with purple energy.
The water lights up for a second, suffused with

02:38:15.919 --> 02:38:21.934
some sort of magical flash and then comes back to
rest. Grog, it's your turn.

02:38:21.934 --> 02:38:31.104
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm singing. I would like
to un-click the rod, actually. Yeah.

02:38:31.104 --> 02:38:39.530
MATT: Okay. You fall to the ground, taking eight
points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to four.

02:38:39.530 --> 02:38:40.881
SAM: That's first blood.

02:38:40.881 --> 02:38:45.418
(laughter)

02:38:45.418 --> 02:38:56.617
TRAVIS: All right. Can I run around over here? Do
I see fucking anything?

02:38:56.617 --> 02:39:01.697
MATT: You see Keyleth up there. That's it.
Percival, you know, is up there.

02:39:01.697 --> 02:39:12.390
TRAVIS: Both totally within range. Is there a door
over there that I can't see? Is there a door over

02:39:12.390 --> 02:39:13.554
on this side?

02:39:13.554 --> 02:39:17.635
MATT: On this side, the tower? Yeah, there's an
opening on each side, or each corner, yeah.

02:39:17.635 --> 02:39:19.745
TRAVIS: Can I get to the door from where I am?

02:39:19.745 --> 02:39:21.075
MATT: You can.

02:39:21.075 --> 02:39:22.927
TRAVIS: Can I go inside?

02:39:22.927 --> 02:39:25.047
MATT: You go inside? All right.

02:39:25.047 --> 02:39:27.390
MARISHA: I'm so stealthy, I've lost myself.

02:39:27.390 --> 02:39:34.306
MATT: So that's your action? So you get inside
there. You are now at the center of the tower.

02:39:34.306 --> 02:39:38.070
I'll put you down there just because you're big
for the tower size.

02:39:38.070 --> 02:39:43.123
MARISHA: Going assassin this time. Or thief? You
were assassin last time.

02:39:43.123 --> 02:39:46.576
MATT: All right, ending Grog's turn. Vax.

02:39:46.576 --> 02:39:48.334
LIAM: Troll text, coming your way!

02:39:48.334 --> 02:39:52.106
MARISHA: Goddamn it. You are the literal worst.

02:39:52.106 --> 02:40:00.011
LIAM: I know. Damn it, went to fix a typo I sent
to him and it just did it again. It said "basted"

02:40:00.011 --> 02:40:01.951
instead of "hasted."

02:40:01.951 --> 02:40:05.744
MATT: Technically you can't do that.

02:40:05.744 --> 02:40:09.006
LIAM: Oh, okay. So then--

02:40:09.006 --> 02:40:16.902
MATT: Not as that type of action.

02:40:16.902 --> 02:40:21.464
SAM: He's sending you a gif right now of Dramatic
Chipmunk.

02:40:21.464 --> 02:40:30.970
TALIESIN: That was well done, Grog. I'll tell you
later, but I had plans and you foiled a chunk of

02:40:30.970 --> 02:40:32.227
them.

02:40:32.227 --> 02:40:38.869
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. There's not a lot I can do. I'm
just chasing a bunch of people I can't see.

02:40:38.869 --> 02:40:42.095
LIAM: I can do that. Sure!

02:40:42.095 --> 02:40:43.321
MATT: So you're not doing the first thing?

02:40:43.321 --> 02:40:44.610
LIAM: No, you said I couldn't do the first thing.

02:40:44.610 --> 02:40:46.104
MATT: Not as a hasted action.

02:40:46.104 --> 02:40:49.110
LIAM: Fuck, man.

02:40:49.110 --> 02:40:52.271
TRAVIS: Oh, for the love of god.

02:40:52.271 --> 02:40:57.879
LIAM: Okay, can I reverse that? I can reverse
that, right? If you go back to the first thing?

02:40:57.879 --> 02:40:59.482
MATT: You can't hold a hasted action.

02:40:59.482 --> 02:41:03.153
LIAM: Sure, but I have a regular action, right? So
I'll do it on the regular action.

02:41:03.153 --> 02:41:05.360
MATT: Okay. The first thing you said?

02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:06.908
LIAM: Yes, the first thing I said.

02:41:06.908 --> 02:41:14.951
MATT: Okay. Scanlan, Keyleth. You watch as this
chamber over here, billowing fog emerges from this

02:41:14.951 --> 02:41:21.828
chamber over here. The entire outside of this room
is now completely surrounded in fog.

02:41:21.828 --> 02:41:23.606
SAM: We've got a rogue.

02:41:23.606 --> 02:41:28.728
LIAM: Right, sorry. Yep. Good, but, yep. I'm
good.

02:41:28.728 --> 02:41:31.562
TRAVIS: What the fuck did you just say?!

02:41:31.562 --> 02:41:39.691
LIAM: On a hasted action, I can only attack. I
can't cast spells, which is what I suggested. But

02:41:39.691 --> 02:41:42.710
if I just flip what I do where, I should be
relatively okay.

02:41:42.710 --> 02:41:44.419
MATT: Yeah, but you can't hold a hasted action.

02:41:44.419 --> 02:41:47.713
LIAM: Then I'll do the second thing.

02:41:47.713 --> 02:41:50.495
MATT: That fog cloud's out.

02:41:50.495 --> 02:41:56.143
LIAM: I understand, because that's not part of the
second thing.

02:41:56.143 --> 02:41:58.041
MARISHA: So wait, is the fog cloud there or no?

02:41:58.041 --> 02:41:59.879
MATT: The fog cloud's there.

02:41:59.879 --> 02:42:07.085
LIAM: What am I supposed to do? Announce every
move to you guys while I'm hidden? It defeats the

02:42:07.085 --> 02:42:08.273
purpose!

02:42:08.273 --> 02:42:10.934
TALIESIN: If I tell you what I'm playing next game
will you just stop this?

02:42:10.934 --> 02:42:12.533
LIAM: Dick, dick, dick!

02:42:12.533 --> 02:42:18.785
MATT: Keyleth, it's your turn. You just watched
this fog billow out from the open doorway and

02:42:18.785 --> 02:42:20.235
surround--

02:42:20.235 --> 02:42:21.461
LIAM: I thought you said it was out?

02:42:21.461 --> 02:42:24.621
MARISHA: No, he means it is literally out.

02:42:24.621 --> 02:42:26.031
LIAM: Oh, out the door?

02:42:26.031 --> 02:42:27.087
SAM: There's no door!

02:42:27.087 --> 02:42:28.040
MATT: The door is open.

02:42:28.040 --> 02:42:29.052
TALIESIN: The door got exploded.

02:42:29.052 --> 02:42:34.526
MATT: Yeah, the door is shattered by Grog, so you
went in the chamber and fog cloud fills and

02:42:34.526 --> 02:42:36.994
encompasses the surrounding area.

02:42:36.994 --> 02:42:39.196
TRAVIS: I should go check that out.

02:42:39.196 --> 02:42:46.917
MARISHA: I'm going to hover over--

02:42:46.999 --> 02:42:48.855
LIAM: It's fine, it's fine.

02:42:48.855 --> 02:43:01.887
MARISHA: First smoke. Where there's smoke, there
must be a Vax, so I'm going to hover over a little bit.

02:43:01.887 --> 02:43:03.677
MATT: Okay, how far over?

02:43:03.677 --> 02:43:12.054
MARISHA: Move me up 30 feet or so. Or 60 feet.
That's good.

02:43:12.054 --> 02:43:13.610
MATT: That's 50 feet there.

02:43:13.610 --> 02:43:20.742
MARISHA: And then I'm going to be like, Hey boo, I
recognize that spell. That's some druid shit! And

02:43:20.742 --> 02:43:27.360
then I'm going to light up the entire area with a
Fire Storm.

02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:36.632
MATT: Okay. All around it.

02:43:36.632 --> 02:43:38.379
MARISHA: Radiating outward. Ten of them.

02:43:38.379 --> 02:43:41.537
MATT: So you hear this and time slows for a
second. Over the earring. As you hear this small

02:43:41.537 --> 02:43:46.548
whine, this (high-pitched whine) (explosion) And
it's nothing but bright light and flames around

02:43:46.548 --> 02:43:53.085
you. It completely engulfs the chamber you're in
and around it. You guys watch and, I'll say this,

02:43:53.085 --> 02:43:57.509
I'm going to say it burns off the fog cloud.

02:43:57.509 --> 02:44:01.716
LIAM: So she did it inside the building?

02:44:01.716 --> 02:44:05.966
MATT: Inside the building, all around it. So I
need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving

02:44:05.966 --> 02:44:07.089
throw.

02:44:07.089 --> 02:44:08.483
LIAM: I'm not worried. Hold on, say that again?

02:44:08.483 --> 02:44:09.689
MATT: Dexterity saving throw.

02:44:09.689 --> 02:44:15.912
LIAM: Yeah, that's right. I'm going to use my
second Luck of the day. Oh, that's good. That's

02:44:15.912 --> 02:44:18.975
real good. That's a 29.

02:44:18.975 --> 02:44:27.082
MATT: All right. You've managed to dive behind
where the chest was open from Grog earlier, jump

02:44:27.082 --> 02:44:32.192
into the chest, and slam it closed, just as the
flames engulf the interior, burning the outside

02:44:32.192 --> 02:44:38.396
of the-- He's a little man. As it burns the
exterior of the chest, you manage to avoid all

02:44:38.396 --> 02:44:39.644
damage from the spell.

02:44:39.644 --> 02:44:40.917
SAM: Is it a refrigerator?

02:44:40.917 --> 02:44:41.710
MARISHA: All damage?

02:44:41.710 --> 02:44:46.119
MATT: He has evasion as a rogue. If he succeeds a
dexterity saving throw, he takes no damage.

02:44:46.119 --> 02:44:48.671
TRAVIS: I love how cocky he is when he's like, I'm
going to die!

02:44:48.671 --> 02:44:55.516
LIAM: I am going to die! It's just, later. You
three don't know shit.

02:44:55.516 --> 02:44:58.069
TALIESIN: Actually, I saw that.

02:44:58.069 --> 02:45:04.157
MATT: Yep. As the firestorm dissipates, that chest
is destroyed. You kick off the smoking bits of it.

02:45:04.157 --> 02:45:08.169
MARISHA: At least I've taken out all y'all's
health potions. That was part of the goal.

02:45:08.169 --> 02:45:11.114
MATT: Keyleth, you're going to stay where you
are?

02:45:11.114 --> 02:45:18.989
MARISHA: I'll back up a little bit. Trying to stay
away from Scanlan. Wait, what's your range?

02:45:18.989 --> 02:45:25.612
TALIESIN: My range is there is no getting away
from me. I have a minimum range of 400 feet. There

02:45:25.612 --> 02:45:27.467
is nowhere to hide.

02:45:27.467 --> 02:45:37.362
MARISHA: If I drop down behind the tower, could I
not be seen by Percy? Fly across this way?

02:45:37.362 --> 02:45:39.880
TALIESIN: My shitty gun has a 400-foot range.

02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:41.599
SAM: But it can't go through stone.

02:45:41.599 --> 02:45:45.971
TALIESIN: No, it can't. Yet. I will make ghost
bullets one day.

02:45:45.971 --> 02:45:53.020
TRAVIS: I would try to run up and grapple you or
throw something at you, but you're made of fucking

02:45:53.020 --> 02:45:54.211
wind.

02:45:54.211 --> 02:45:56.198
MARISHA: That's your only evasion that you have,
right?

02:45:56.198 --> 02:45:58.243
LIAM: No, man, that's unlimited.

02:45:58.243 --> 02:46:02.846
MATT: Keyleth, with the rest of your movement and
descending, actually you'd probably get about

02:46:02.846 --> 02:46:03.902
there.

02:46:03.902 --> 02:46:07.417
MARISHA: Until you get hit? You can keep doing
that until-- Wait, but I thought you have one that

02:46:07.417 --> 02:46:09.783
gives you half damage and one that's all damage?

02:46:09.783 --> 02:46:14.198
LIAM: I'm not telling you anything about my rules. You
can figure it out.

02:46:14.198 --> 02:46:18.265
MATT: As you've seen Vax through the entirety of
your gameplay, you'd know that if he has to make a

02:46:18.265 --> 02:46:23.211
dexterity saving throw, if he fails, he takes half
damage. If he succeeds, he takes none. Or he can

02:46:23.211 --> 02:46:25.471
use his reaction to take half damage from a
melee.

02:46:25.471 --> 02:46:26.734
MARISHA: A reaction?

02:46:26.734 --> 02:46:30.469
LIAM: Since your husband told you, reaction is if
you try to hit me with a sword, and I can only do

02:46:30.469 --> 02:46:31.614
that once per round.

02:46:31.614 --> 02:46:32.642
MATT: Or any attack.

02:46:32.642 --> 02:46:33.772
LIAM: Right, melee attack.

02:46:33.772 --> 02:46:35.278
MATT: Oh, yeah, from any melee.

02:46:35.278 --> 02:46:43.675
LIAM: Evasion is just dexterity saves. So use that
information. You can use that information,

02:46:43.675 --> 02:46:44.782
Marisha.

02:46:44.782 --> 02:46:48.474
TALIESIN: You know what doesn't take a dexterity
save? Sending to another dimension.

02:46:48.474 --> 02:46:53.964
LIAM: Dimensions, Finger of Death. I mean it's
inevitable. You're going to kill me eventually.

02:46:53.964 --> 02:46:56.344
It's true!

02:46:56.344 --> 02:47:01.389
MATT: Level 20 rogue. Playing this for five years.
Still don't know how Uncanny Dodge works. "When an

02:47:01.389 --> 02:47:07.782
"attacker you can see hits you with an attack." As
long as you can see them, you can reduce it by

02:47:07.782 --> 02:47:08.770
half.

02:47:08.770 --> 02:47:12.140
LIAM: I never claimed to memorize this book,
people. Next campaign, I'm going to fuck it up

02:47:12.140 --> 02:47:14.149
just as much. If that bothers you--

02:47:14.149 --> 02:47:17.750
MATT: That was the other ability. Evasion is the
one that he used. Yeah, evasion's every time.

02:47:17.750 --> 02:47:23.518
You're good. All right, so that finishes Keyleth's
turn. You managed to dodge out of Percival's view.

02:47:23.518 --> 02:47:26.982
Percy, you're up. Top of the round I need you to
make a constitution saving throw, because even

02:47:26.982 --> 02:47:29.982
though you're standing on the ceiling, you're
still against the force.

02:47:29.982 --> 02:47:37.253
TALIESIN: That's fine. Constitution saving throw,
let's do this. I've got a plan. I'm going to use

02:47:37.253 --> 02:47:45.353
my second resolve, or my second thing,
Indomitable. Let's hope that's better. That's way

02:47:45.353 --> 02:47:46.627
better, 19.

02:47:46.627 --> 02:47:51.340
MATT: 19 will succeed, yeah, because it's an 18.
All right, so.

02:47:51.340 --> 02:47:56.027
TALIESIN: And now I'm going to try and do
something stupid.

02:47:56.027 --> 02:48:03.347
MATT: All right, so you suffer the 11 points of
force damage, reduced to five. Five points of

02:48:03.347 --> 02:48:07.752
force damage and you are not jettisoned off the
force field. So it's considered rough terrain for

02:48:07.752 --> 02:48:09.046
you to move across.

02:48:09.046 --> 02:48:19.822
TALIESIN: Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going
to use 25 points of my movement to run.

02:48:19.822 --> 02:48:21.523
MATT: Okay, it's rough terrain, so--

02:48:21.523 --> 02:48:26.914
TALIESIN: Oh. I'm going to use my movement to run
15 feet.

02:48:26.914 --> 02:48:30.051
MATT: 15, you're just--

02:48:30.051 --> 02:48:32.533
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and take a running jump
to the top of the tower.

02:48:32.533 --> 02:48:38.452
MATT: Okay, so you're going to leap and release
the boots? Make an acrobatics check, please. As

02:48:38.452 --> 02:48:42.180
you go and try and leap for it--

02:48:42.180 --> 02:48:47.715
TALIESIN: All right, acrobatics check. Come on,
baby. That's 23.

02:48:47.715 --> 02:48:55.097
MATT: 23? All right, so you reduce the damage you
take from the leap.

02:48:55.097 --> 02:48:57.823
TALIESIN: That's a much better fall than I was
going to get.

02:48:57.823 --> 02:49:08.041
MATT: It would've been 18 points of bludgeoning
damage, reduced to nine. Nine points of

02:49:08.041 --> 02:49:09.161
bludgeoning damage.

02:49:09.161 --> 02:49:13.436
TALIESIN: And then I have to do another
constitution saving throw for the silence spell?

02:49:13.436 --> 02:49:18.146
MATT: Correct. Well, first from the-- You have to
make it twice.

02:49:18.146 --> 02:49:20.090
TALIESIN: Oh. 23.

02:49:20.090 --> 02:49:22.635
MATT: And another one for the impact. One was for
the force field and one was for the fall.

02:49:22.635 --> 02:49:24.729
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

02:49:24.729 --> 02:49:25.952
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

02:49:25.952 --> 02:49:39.429
TALIESIN: And then, so I'm 23 points in. Is it
worth blowing any of this? Yeah. Am I feeling the

02:49:39.429 --> 02:49:40.614
healing?

02:49:40.614 --> 02:49:43.395
MATT: No, your movement dropped you outside of the
circle.

02:49:43.395 --> 02:49:45.828
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to use what little
I have left--

02:49:45.828 --> 02:49:47.791
MATT: You have no more movement.

02:49:47.791 --> 02:49:50.430
TALIESIN: I have no more movement, even from a
double-up? Using my action?

02:49:50.430 --> 02:49:53.684
MATT: Oh, if you use your action for a dash? Then
you can get there, yeah.

02:49:53.684 --> 02:49:58.026
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my action for a dash to
stand on the trap. Like, stand right to the trap,

02:49:58.026 --> 02:49:59.147
yeah.

02:49:59.147 --> 02:50:02.068
MATT: Well the trapdoor you blew open, so it's
currently open. So you stand right at the edge of

02:50:02.068 --> 02:50:02.784
it.

02:50:02.784 --> 02:50:06.049
TALIESIN: I stand there and I'm waiting to see
what the hell is going on at this point.

02:50:06.049 --> 02:50:09.899
MATT: Okay, ending Percival's turn. Scanlan,
you're up.

02:50:09.899 --> 02:50:14.589
SAM: Scanlan's up. Scanlan's going to peek around
the corner.

02:50:14.589 --> 02:50:20.216
MATT: You see Keyleth floating there. You see the
flames burst around this interior, the fog cloud

02:50:20.216 --> 02:50:21.474
dissipates.

02:50:21.474 --> 02:50:28.912
SAM: I'm going to throw in a Firebolt right in the
front door. Wand of Fireballs.

02:50:28.912 --> 02:50:30.174
MATT: Okay. How many?

02:50:30.174 --> 02:50:34.418
SAM: Two charges. That's 9d6.

02:50:34.418 --> 02:50:35.751
LIAM: Where you at, girl?

02:50:35.751 --> 02:50:38.629
MARISHA: To quote the rogue: You don't know.

02:50:38.629 --> 02:50:47.377
MATT: You kick off the broken chest. Right as you
right yourself, a beam of red light goes into the

02:50:47.377 --> 02:50:52.025
room, explodes a second time. Make a dexterity
save with a DC of--

02:50:52.025 --> 02:50:54.452
SAM: 15.

02:50:54.452 --> 02:50:59.853
LIAM: 20.

02:50:59.853 --> 02:51:07.352
MATT: Yeah, so no damage. You're like, "Oh god!"
You leap out of the way and as you pull your cloak

02:51:07.352 --> 02:51:12.599
up and the cloak burns and singes on the outside,
but you manage to avoid the damage as you flatten

02:51:12.599 --> 02:51:13.909
up against the wall.

02:51:13.909 --> 02:51:17.130
SAM: I got him, guys! He's real rough!

02:51:17.130 --> 02:51:21.839
TRAVIS: Two fireballs in a bunker and no damage.

02:51:21.839 --> 02:51:25.419
MATT: Unfortunately, that's exactly the kind of
thing that rogues are really good at avoiding.

02:51:25.419 --> 02:51:32.213
They're an up-close or lock-down type scenario or
they're going to be jumping around all your booms.

02:51:32.213 --> 02:51:34.605
Scanlan, that's your action.

02:51:34.605 --> 02:51:45.098
SAM: Bonus action, I'm going to put on Gloves of
Swim/Climb. I think I got them in Pathfinder. I

02:51:45.098 --> 02:51:46.425
don't know what they are.

02:51:46.425 --> 02:51:48.898
MATT: They'll give you advantage on climbing
checks.

02:51:48.898 --> 02:51:51.861
MARISHA: They're climbing flippers?

02:51:51.861 --> 02:51:54.965
SAM: Great. That's it.

02:51:54.965 --> 02:51:57.114
MATT: That's your turn. Grog.

02:51:57.114 --> 02:51:58.836
TRAVIS: Yeah. What's up?

02:51:58.836 --> 02:52:10.721
MATT: Top of your turn. The braziers on the sides
of the tower burst into flame, incinerating all the

02:52:10.721 --> 02:52:14.296
space around, which affects Keyleth, who is hiding
behind the side of the tower. I need you to make a

02:52:14.296 --> 02:52:16.966
dexterity saving throw.

02:52:16.966 --> 02:52:18.655
MARISHA: I thought the circles were going?

02:52:18.655 --> 02:52:19.889
TRAVIS: Nope. It's the fire.

02:52:19.889 --> 02:52:22.926
MARISHA: The fires? Did I get behind?

02:52:22.926 --> 02:52:24.112
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:52:24.112 --> 02:52:27.646
MARISHA: Goddamn it. That's fine.

02:52:27.646 --> 02:52:29.541
MATT: Because the water glowed last time.

02:52:29.541 --> 02:52:34.055
MARISHA: Dex saving throw? 15.

02:52:34.055 --> 02:52:49.596
MATT: Nope. That is 30 points of fire damage to
you. As the flames subside, your wind form is

02:52:49.596 --> 02:52:54.472
burned a bit. Grog, you're up.

02:52:54.472 --> 02:52:59.984
TRAVIS: Would it be stupid to try to grapple a
wind elemental? There's not really anything to

02:52:59.984 --> 02:53:01.298
grab, right?

02:53:01.298 --> 02:53:08.382
MATT: I don't know. You hear the wind whipping
around outside, but you don't see anything.

02:53:08.382 --> 02:53:14.489
TRAVIS: Could I step out the door? Like five
feet.

02:53:14.489 --> 02:53:22.105
MATT: You look up immediately and see Keyleth
floating there in elemental form after the flames

02:53:22.105 --> 02:53:23.478
subside.

02:53:23.478 --> 02:53:29.637
TRAVIS: All right, let's just try it because fuck
it. Can I use my boots of feral leaping to make a

02:53:29.637 --> 02:53:33.442
15-foot vertical leap with a DC of 16?

02:53:33.442 --> 02:53:39.242
MATT: You can. She's 20 feet up in the air,
though. You glance up and she's 20 feet up.

02:53:39.242 --> 02:53:45.677
TRAVIS: Just too much. Could I try and climb up
the side of the tower?

02:53:45.677 --> 02:53:48.200
MATT: Sure. Make an athletics check.

02:53:48.200 --> 02:53:54.138
TRAVIS: 18.

02:53:54.138 --> 02:53:58.267
MATT: Yeah, you're able to get up to about her
height. You're technically base-to-base with her

02:53:58.267 --> 02:53:59.938
against the side of the tower.

02:53:59.938 --> 02:54:04.289
TRAVIS: Cool. I'm going to leap off the tower and
try to grab onto Keyleth.

02:54:04.289 --> 02:54:08.650
MATT: Make a grapple check.

02:54:08.650 --> 02:54:11.133
MARISHA: I am immune to grapple.

02:54:11.133 --> 02:54:12.757
MATT: I know, but I want him to roll it.

02:54:12.757 --> 02:54:19.861
TRAVIS: Okay. What can I do in this game? Zero
because you're immune to grapple.

02:54:19.861 --> 02:54:28.711
MATT: Grog, you fall through and land on the
ground prone and partially in the water. You

02:54:28.711 --> 02:54:33.235
suffer eight points of bludgeoning damage, reduced
to four.

02:54:33.235 --> 02:54:34.466
SAM: First blood.

02:54:34.466 --> 02:54:40.322
TRAVIS: Cool.

02:54:40.322 --> 02:54:50.957
MATT: You also notice the field that surrounds the
chambers shifts in a bit. Scanlan, make a

02:54:50.957 --> 02:54:56.667
constitution saving throw. You watch as it all
closes in by five feet.

02:54:56.667 --> 02:54:58.666
SAM: 28!

02:54:58.666 --> 02:55:03.661
MARISHA: He put a time limit on this whole thing.

02:55:03.661 --> 02:55:05.022
TALIESIN: Good man.

02:55:05.022 --> 02:55:10.035
MATT: You take 11 points of force damage and you
are not forced out of the way. However, you are up

02:55:10.035 --> 02:55:18.027
against it being pushed against the wall, you have
to squeeze out of it. You can see it slowly

02:55:18.027 --> 02:55:25.891
condensing itself. As it does, you glance up at
the sky and see this grinning, mysterious visage

02:55:25.891 --> 02:55:34.524
made of cloud swirling energy. A grinning beard.
That's the end of Grog's turn. Vax, you're up.

02:55:34.524 --> 02:55:41.694
LIAM: Okay. I've got movement, bonus action,
hasted action, and my regular action. I'm going to use

02:55:41.694 --> 02:55:49.005
movement and bonus action to blast out of that
door. Everybody sees me arc up into the sky and

02:55:49.005 --> 02:55:56.827
fly over this tower and disappear here. I'll tell
you what happens next via text.

02:55:56.827 --> 02:55:59.494
SAM: We got a little Liam there! Liam talked!

02:55:59.494 --> 02:56:02.464
MARISHA: It's a bottle rocket! Oh wait, nope.

02:56:02.464 --> 02:56:11.227
MATT: You saw him disappear somewhere down below
there. As far as you know, as a marker, somewhere

02:56:11.227 --> 02:56:13.955
in that area you saw Vax vanish.

02:56:13.955 --> 02:56:18.526
TRAVIS: Fucking flying motherfucker.

02:56:18.526 --> 02:56:24.694
MATT: Keyleth, your turn.

02:56:24.694 --> 02:56:38.070
MARISHA: Okay. My turn. I've got a prone Grog in
front of me.

02:56:38.070 --> 02:56:39.411
SAM: Yeah, man.

02:56:39.411 --> 02:56:41.938
MARISHA: I'm going to do something great, right?

02:56:41.938 --> 02:56:43.483
TRAVIS: Yep, fire it up.

02:56:43.483 --> 02:56:58.420
MARISHA: Shit. But what to do? (grumbles) Oh god.

02:56:58.420 --> 02:57:01.146
MATT: I'm confused by that image.

02:57:01.146 --> 02:57:03.256
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to elaborate.

02:57:03.256 --> 02:57:06.007
MATT: Keyleth, what're you doing?

02:57:06.007 --> 02:57:11.112
MARISHA: Sorry, Grog. I'm going to try this one
more time.

02:57:11.112 --> 02:57:13.534
TRAVIS: Do it, please. End my suffering.

02:57:13.534 --> 02:57:15.689
MARISHA: I'm going to land.

02:57:15.689 --> 02:57:18.692
TRAVIS: Give me some kind of contact with another
being.

02:57:18.692 --> 02:57:24.125
MATT: You slowly descend, swirling wind arms.

02:57:24.125 --> 02:57:28.832
MARISHA: I'm going to drop my form.

02:57:28.832 --> 02:57:38.538
MATT: The wind form shifts out and Keyleth
descends, landing right down with you.

02:57:38.538 --> 02:57:39.819
TRAVIS: Hey, Ki.

02:57:39.819 --> 02:57:47.943
MARISHA: I'm going to say: Don't save against
this! And I'm going to try Plane Shift! Because it

02:57:47.943 --> 02:57:50.013
fucking failed last time!

02:57:50.013 --> 02:57:51.801
MATT: What's the saving throw on that?

02:57:51.801 --> 02:57:53.801
MARISHA: Mine, 21.

02:57:53.801 --> 02:57:55.150
MATT: No, but what's the saving throw?

02:57:55.150 --> 02:57:56.689
MARISHA: I think it's wisdom.

02:57:56.689 --> 02:57:58.636
MATT: Grog, I need you to make a wisdom saving
throw.

02:57:58.636 --> 02:58:03.475
TRAVIS: No problem. Modifier is zero. Five.

02:58:03.475 --> 02:58:05.865
MATT: Where are you shifting him to?

02:58:05.865 --> 02:58:09.880
MARISHA: Do you have any preference on your
demise?

02:58:09.880 --> 02:58:11.550
SAM: Demise!

02:58:11.550 --> 02:58:15.808
TRAVIS: I don't know. Send me to the Ethereal--
no. Send me to Feywild.

02:58:15.808 --> 02:58:18.389
MARISHA: No. That's too nice.

02:58:18.389 --> 02:58:19.792
TRAVIS: Fuck you!

02:58:19.792 --> 02:58:24.964
(laughter)

02:58:24.964 --> 02:58:30.148
MARISHA: My original plan was to teleport you to
the middle of the water dimension, just have you

02:58:30.148 --> 02:58:31.639
slowly drown.

02:58:31.639 --> 02:58:33.507
SAM and TALIESIN: Sounds pretty awesome.

02:58:33.507 --> 02:58:34.738
LIAM: That's merciful.

02:58:34.738 --> 02:58:39.750
MARISHA: Or my other idea was to send you to the
Maze of the Abyss.

02:58:39.750 --> 02:58:42.786
LIAM: Nah, water is a minute or less, right?

02:58:42.786 --> 02:58:46.377
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll go to the water.

02:58:46.377 --> 02:58:52.883
MATT: Grog, as Keyleth embraces you, there's a
shifting of energy. There's a flash as you see the

02:58:52.883 --> 02:58:57.953
Divine Gate coast past you. Suddenly, you're in
the dark depths of a familiar ocean.

02:58:57.953 --> 02:59:01.748
TRAVIS: Figures.

02:59:01.883 --> 02:59:04.806
MATT: You're holding your breath. You know with
your constitution, you can hold your breath for a

02:59:04.806 --> 02:59:09.755
decent amount of time. As you glance down into the
darkness of the shadow below you, you see movement

02:59:09.755 --> 02:59:16.161
as a series of long, familiar tentacles begin to
emerge from the shadows below. You think, "Let's

02:59:16.161 --> 02:59:19.039
"make this a final, glorious way to go."

02:59:19.039 --> 02:59:20.532
TRAVIS: Do I?

02:59:20.532 --> 02:59:21.882
MATT: I don't know, do you?

02:59:21.882 --> 02:59:23.588
TRAVIS: Probably not.

02:59:23.588 --> 02:59:29.524
MATT: You slowly clam up as you sink down as the
kraken takes you into its maw and swallows you.

02:59:29.524 --> 02:59:31.530
MARISHA: I feel so bad!

02:59:31.530 --> 02:59:33.207
TRAVIS: Fight on!

02:59:33.207 --> 02:59:36.075
MARISHA: Man, that doesn't feel good.

02:59:36.075 --> 02:59:37.324
MATT: First one down.

02:59:37.324 --> 02:59:40.488
MARISHA: It doesn't feel good to be a bully,
everyone, let this be a lesson.

02:59:40.488 --> 02:59:46.617
TRAVIS: Doesn't feel good to be a level 20
barbarian with these strong motherfuckers. Chasing

02:59:46.617 --> 02:59:48.041
your damn tail.

02:59:48.041 --> 02:59:49.216
MARISHA: I still have movement, yeah.

02:59:49.216 --> 02:59:53.746
MATT: You have, in this form, 15 feet.

02:59:53.746 --> 02:59:58.738
TRAVIS: I also don't have a Deck, for anybody
that's wondering. There's no Deck of Many Things.

02:59:58.738 --> 03:00:03.556
MARISHA: Scanlan dropped his Reverse Gravity,
yeah?

03:00:03.556 --> 03:00:05.074
MATT: Correct.

03:00:05.074 --> 03:00:07.864
MARISHA: Scanlan's there.

03:00:07.864 --> 03:00:09.329
LIAM: I sent a clarification.

03:00:09.329 --> 03:00:16.926
MARISHA: Do I have enough movement to move over
there? Actually, you know what? No one's in the

03:00:16.926 --> 03:00:21.473
tower, right? You went over there. Oh, shit.
Goddamn it.

03:00:21.473 --> 03:00:23.377
LIAM: Such a question, isn't it?

03:00:23.377 --> 03:00:31.148
MARISHA: Do I have my bonus action still? I do,
right?

03:00:31.148 --> 03:00:32.337
MATT: Yeah.

03:00:32.337 --> 03:00:34.939
MARISHA: I'm going to use my bonus action to turn
into an earth elemental.

03:00:34.939 --> 03:00:39.712
MATT: Is it a bonus action to drop form?

03:00:39.712 --> 03:00:42.083
MARISHA: Oh fuck, yeah. It is.

03:00:42.083 --> 03:00:43.662
MATT: I'll double-check.

03:00:43.662 --> 03:00:52.503
MARISHA: Let me go over there. I can't reach.

03:00:52.503 --> 03:01:05.828
MATT: Yep, it's a bonus action to revert, so you
have to be in Keyleth form. You have 15 feet of

03:01:05.828 --> 03:01:06.853
movement.

03:01:06.853 --> 03:01:09.315
MARISHA: I'm going to use my awesome mantle which
allows me to jump.

03:01:09.315 --> 03:01:11.341
MATT: What's your strength?

03:01:11.341 --> 03:01:13.177
MARISHA: What?

03:01:13.177 --> 03:01:14.738
MATT: What's your strength score?

03:01:14.738 --> 03:01:16.479
MARISHA: Just my modifier?

03:01:16.479 --> 03:01:17.855
MATT: Your strength score.

03:01:17.855 --> 03:01:21.694
MARISHA: My strength score is 14, so I have plus
two to my strength.

03:01:21.694 --> 03:01:27.003
MATT: That's the distance you can jump in feet is
your strength score. So triple that, you can jump

03:01:27.003 --> 03:01:28.223
pretty far.

03:01:28.223 --> 03:01:35.050
MARISHA: Let me jump behind there. Do I have
enough, with the rest of my movement, can I get

03:01:35.050 --> 03:01:36.467
inside this building?

03:01:36.467 --> 03:01:38.420
MATT: No, that would be part of your movement.

03:01:38.420 --> 03:01:39.625
MARISHA: Then I'll stay there.

03:01:39.625 --> 03:01:43.442
MATT: Okay. Finishing Keyleth's turn, Percival,
you're up. You heal 20 hit points.

03:01:43.442 --> 03:01:45.924
SAM: That's nice!

03:01:45.924 --> 03:02:02.630
TALIESIN: I'm going to head this way on the tower.
(counting) Do I see Keyleth?

03:02:02.630 --> 03:02:06.228
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:02:06.228 --> 03:02:12.289
TALIESIN: I'm down for that. That's a terrible
roll. That's 16.

03:02:12.289 --> 03:02:18.787
MATT: She's not hiding, so you do see the very
edge of her. He has an eyeline to the very edge of

03:02:18.787 --> 03:02:22.351
you. That's as far as you can get with your
movement. She has three-quarters cover.

03:02:22.351 --> 03:02:26.502
TALIESIN: That doesn't matter to me. How far away
is she?

03:02:26.502 --> 03:02:31.488
MATT: You're eyeballing maybe about 45, 50 feet.

03:02:31.488 --> 03:02:41.353
TALIESIN: I'm going to do something really weird.
I'm going to pull out the Iron Bands of Bilarro.

03:02:41.353 --> 03:02:49.503
I'm going to make a toss, try and nail her in the
head. It's got a range of 60 feet.

03:02:49.503 --> 03:02:53.944
MATT: It does. Make a ranged attack roll.

03:02:53.944 --> 03:02:57.547
LIAM: Take me out to the ball game!

03:02:57.547 --> 03:03:02.139
MARISHA: Take me out to the-- what's after that?

03:03:02.139 --> 03:03:03.198
TRAVIS: The crowd.

03:03:03.198 --> 03:03:04.299
MARISHA: The crowd!

03:03:04.299 --> 03:03:08.625
TALIESIN: 30.

03:03:08.625 --> 03:03:11.115
SAM: It's a good throw.

03:03:11.115 --> 03:03:22.647
MATT: All right. Keyleth, as you're ducking
around, you hear this faint shout in the distance of--

03:03:22.647 --> 03:03:29.530
TALIESIN: Manners! Oh, you don't! Does it work?

03:03:29.530 --> 03:03:30.710
MATT: No!

03:03:30.710 --> 03:03:33.335
MARISHA: I have Freedom of Movement, too, cast on
me.

03:03:33.335 --> 03:03:34.808
LIAM: Too late!

03:03:34.808 --> 03:03:43.823
MATT: As the band expands and wraps around
Keyleth's body, you watch as she quickly slips out

03:03:43.823 --> 03:03:48.708
of the bindings and the chains fall to the ground
before reverting back to a sphere.

03:03:48.708 --> 03:03:50.893
TALIESIN: Damn!

03:03:50.893 --> 03:03:54.803
LIAM: That's amazing!

03:03:54.803 --> 03:03:58.271
TALIESIN: Fucking oh my god! That was clutch!

03:03:58.271 --> 03:04:00.332
MARISHA: That was so good!

03:04:00.332 --> 03:04:03.227
LIAM: Only because you remembered, holy shit!

03:04:03.227 --> 03:04:05.442
MATT: That would have been bad.

03:04:05.442 --> 03:04:09.289
TALIESIN: I just saw that happen, didn't I?

03:04:09.289 --> 03:04:10.513
MATT: Yeah, you did.

03:04:10.513 --> 03:04:12.547
TALIESIN: All right!

03:04:12.547 --> 03:04:15.906
MARISHA: Thank god for that fucking 4th-level
spell.

03:04:15.906 --> 03:04:26.788
TALIESIN: That was really scary. That was my
attack. I'm going to back off and then go back to

03:04:26.788 --> 03:04:36.773
the center of that tower and sit and try to get
three-quarters cover over there. I want to stay in

03:04:36.773 --> 03:04:38.173
the green light.

03:04:38.173 --> 03:04:43.455
MATT: You're staying there and crouching low.
Ending Percival's turn, Scanlan, you're up. You

03:04:43.455 --> 03:04:49.314
can see Keyleth from around.

03:04:49.314 --> 03:04:50.410
SAM: I can?

03:04:50.410 --> 03:04:52.145
MATT: You pull out of that side there.

03:04:52.145 --> 03:04:54.583
SAM: I'm going to dash right towards Keyleth.

03:04:54.583 --> 03:04:55.790
MATT: Dash?

03:04:55.790 --> 03:04:57.066
SAM: No, just run.

03:04:57.066 --> 03:04:58.689
MATT: That's your movement there.

03:04:58.689 --> 03:04:59.993
SAM: How far away am I?

03:04:59.993 --> 03:05:02.888
MATT: She's about 35, 40 feet.

03:05:02.888 --> 03:05:05.059
SAM: So more than 30?

03:05:05.059 --> 03:05:06.657
MATT: More than 30, correct.

03:05:06.657 --> 03:05:07.964
SAM: Fuck you!

03:05:07.964 --> 03:05:10.513
(laughter)

03:05:10.513 --> 03:05:11.942
MATT: Yeah.

03:05:11.942 --> 03:05:18.557
SAM: Goddamn it.

03:05:18.557 --> 03:05:24.842
MATT: 35 feet, yeah.

03:05:24.842 --> 03:05:35.594
SAM: Goddamn it! All right, I mean I'll just--

03:05:35.594 --> 03:05:37.466
MATT: Sorry, Grog.

03:05:37.466 --> 03:05:39.686
TRAVIS: A barbarian's world.

03:05:39.686 --> 03:05:47.897
SAM: Sorry, changing my mind, seeing if this
works. What is the save?

03:05:47.897 --> 03:05:51.441
MARISHA: Only when we reach level 20, boys, only
when we reach level 20.

03:05:51.441 --> 03:05:53.166
SAM: Wisdom? She's so wise!

03:05:53.166 --> 03:05:55.316
TALIESIN: Oh, a wise guy?

03:05:55.316 --> 03:05:58.625
MARISHA: Early game druids kind of suck, later
games, kind of boss.

03:05:58.625 --> 03:06:07.131
SAM: She's not immune to charm, though. I've
already charmed her once. Yeah, fuck it. One more

03:06:07.131 --> 03:06:08.689
thing to check, sorry.

03:06:08.689 --> 03:06:11.050
LIAM: Sam, 20 levels and you haven't got your
spells in order?

03:06:11.050 --> 03:06:19.837
SAM: This is a brand new spell, I've never used
it! What's the range? It's 30 feet, great. I will

03:06:19.837 --> 03:06:21.393
Dominate Person.

03:06:21.393 --> 03:06:23.482
MATT: Dominate Person for Keyleth.

03:06:23.482 --> 03:06:28.877
SAM: Yeah, it's not going to work because she's
super wise, but I'll try.

03:06:28.877 --> 03:06:32.481
MATT: Okay, you need to make a wisdom saving
throw. You have advantage because you are

03:06:32.481 --> 03:06:34.284
a half-elf, so you have advantage against charm
effects.

03:06:34.284 --> 03:06:37.748
LIAM: Oh shit, with her wisdom? Good luck, buddy.

03:06:37.748 --> 03:06:40.997
MARISHA: What do I have to save? 22?

03:06:40.997 --> 03:06:42.325
SAM: 22.

03:06:42.325 --> 03:06:56.446
MARISHA: Let me do the math really quick. Yeah, I'm
all right. I rolled a natural 16.

03:06:56.446 --> 03:06:59.716
MATT: Sorry, Scanlan, she resists the spell.

03:06:59.716 --> 03:07:12.132
SAM: It's fine. As my bonus action I will say to
her: That spell was an inspiration and we're still

03:07:12.132 --> 03:07:14.728
on the same team, right?

03:07:14.728 --> 03:07:20.377
MARISHA: I feel so bad I had to teleport Grog
away, but I'm still looking for Vax.

03:07:20.377 --> 03:07:22.465
SAM: Okay, me too.

03:07:22.465 --> 03:07:33.577
MATT: That finishes your turn. The field shimmies
and crunches even closer. You watch as this

03:07:33.577 --> 03:07:36.758
distant building begins to collapse inward.

03:07:36.758 --> 03:07:39.356
LIAM: Oh wow, Matt. Oh wow!

03:07:39.356 --> 03:07:41.284
MARISHA: Did you turn it in?

03:07:41.284 --> 03:07:43.601
MATT: That door's destroyed.

03:07:43.601 --> 03:07:45.529
LIAM and MARISHA: Stay turnt.

03:07:45.529 --> 03:07:46.992
TRAVIS: The portal's gone.

03:07:46.992 --> 03:07:48.976
TALIESIN: So, two squares in all around.

03:07:48.976 --> 03:07:50.807
MATT: Two squares in all around.

03:07:50.807 --> 03:07:55.638
TALIESIN: I'm in. When we get four we actually
start to remove rock blocks.

03:07:55.638 --> 03:07:59.424
SAM: What's up? Who's next?

03:07:59.424 --> 03:08:00.591
MATT: Vax.

03:08:00.591 --> 03:08:10.082
LIAM: I'm going to use my 120 feet of regular
movement to fly out of my hiding place into the

03:08:10.082 --> 03:08:19.707
air. This is probably half my movement, right
about there. I can't see, about there. Don't

03:08:19.707 --> 03:08:27.090
worry, this is temporary. I wouldn't do that. I
see Percival, Scanlan, Keyleth. I've used half my

03:08:27.090 --> 03:08:32.750
movement about, I would guess. And I'm going to
use my bonus action to use Vow of Enmity on

03:08:32.750 --> 03:08:34.272
Keyleth.

03:08:34.272 --> 03:08:41.011
MATT: You watch as you suddenly turn and look up
into the sky as you see, giant wings unfolded, Vax

03:08:41.011 --> 03:08:46.134
points down at you and with a giant
earth-shattering caw in the sky of a raven cry,

03:08:46.134 --> 03:08:51.151
you feel this mark penetrate your chest, as he
marks you with his Vow of Enmity.

03:08:51.151 --> 03:08:56.624
LIAM: I want to fly within 60 feet of her using
still my base movement.

03:08:56.624 --> 03:08:58.356
MATT: You are about 60 feet here.

03:08:58.356 --> 03:09:06.118
LIAM: I will use my regular paladin attack, which
is an attack-attack, to attack her. Which is at

03:09:06.118 --> 03:09:08.302
advantage because of the Vow of Enmity.

03:09:08.302 --> 03:09:09.594
MATT: Correct.

03:09:09.594 --> 03:09:16.101
LIAM: Not great. I'm going to use a Luck. I'm
going to use a Luck. That's better. Not much

03:09:16.101 --> 03:09:20.054
better. That is a 20.

03:09:20.054 --> 03:09:21.374
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:09:21.374 --> 03:09:40.865
LIAM: Right, so here we go, just a little bit,
though. A tickle for you, really. (counting) 28

03:09:40.865 --> 03:09:43.558
and that's the first attack and then the second
attack--

03:09:43.558 --> 03:09:45.191
MATT: Total of 28 on that one?

03:09:45.191 --> 03:09:46.570
LIAM: 28, yeah, total.

03:09:46.570 --> 03:09:48.019
MARISHA: 28 what damage?

03:09:48.019 --> 03:09:55.114
LIAM: 28 damage. That was a combo, there was some
psychic, there was eight of psychic. Okay, then

03:09:55.114 --> 03:10:03.704
the second attack is 25 to hit, which also hits,
but it's much dinkier. So that is eight.

03:10:03.704 --> 03:10:06.661
MARISHA: Eight. That's 36 total.

03:10:06.661 --> 03:10:19.284
LIAM: So that was movement plus paladin action,
and I will use my hasted action and bonus action.

03:10:19.284 --> 03:10:24.736
I'll use my haste so I can go another 60 feet and
I'm going to fly about there. Then I'm going

03:10:24.736 --> 03:10:30.206
to use my regular action to-- you guys don't
fucking know. I will tell you where I'm using my

03:10:30.206 --> 03:10:32.468
bonus action to hide.

03:10:32.468 --> 03:10:38.791
MATT: I'm sorry. What? You moved over, used your
paladin action to attack twice--

03:10:38.791 --> 03:10:46.786
LIAM: Attack, attack for paladin action, and I
still have a hasted action and a bonus action. One

03:10:46.786 --> 03:10:49.284
can be used for more movement--

03:10:49.284 --> 03:10:52.347
MATT: Are you moving somewhere with one of your
actions? Is what I'm asking.

03:10:52.347 --> 03:11:00.853
LIAM: 60 feet. Another 60 feet-ish for the base
movement to there. Everybody thinks I don't know

03:11:00.853 --> 03:11:02.160
what I'm talking about!

03:11:02.160 --> 03:11:05.113
MATT: No, I know. I need clarification because
they need to know where you ran off to. They still

03:11:05.113 --> 03:11:06.515
see you. You're still out in the open.

03:11:06.515 --> 03:11:10.459
LIAM: So my base movement gets me to probably
about here, and I use my paladin attack to attack

03:11:10.459 --> 03:11:17.706
twice, right? So I've got bonus action and a
hasted action left. That is 120 feet left on one,

03:11:17.706 --> 03:11:20.033
and then I can use the bonus action to hide.

03:11:20.033 --> 03:11:21.458
MATT: I'm so excited for the new campaign.

03:11:21.458 --> 03:11:24.035
LIAM: I know! (laughter) Me too!

03:11:24.035 --> 03:11:25.338
MATT: This is my own fault.

03:11:25.338 --> 03:11:29.256
LIAM: I have a great character planned! I can't
wait, but I know that I can use another 120 feet

03:11:29.256 --> 03:11:33.947
from here to get to there, there, there, or there
and a bonus action to hide. It's all in the

03:11:33.947 --> 03:11:35.615
fucking book dudes!

03:11:35.615 --> 03:11:40.252
MATT: Your movement is 120 feet, which got you to
there, right.

03:11:40.252 --> 03:11:46.714
LIAM: Paladin action which is attack-attack, and I
still have hasted action which can be used for

03:11:46.714 --> 03:11:47.578
movement--

03:11:47.578 --> 03:11:50.715
MATT: Do it. Text me where you are.

03:11:50.715 --> 03:11:51.627
LIAM: It's right!

03:11:51.627 --> 03:11:55.322
MATT: It's correct! You're completely correct! You
are completely correct. No, don't get shit for it.

03:11:55.322 --> 03:12:01.862
You're doing your job. It's just a process to work
out for the scenario of this type of event.

03:12:01.862 --> 03:12:07.572
LIAM: Hey man, send a message to Mike Mearls about
the 5th edition handbook. Thanks, Mike Mearls, I

03:12:07.572 --> 03:12:08.980
love the handbook.

03:12:08.980 --> 03:12:11.385
MARISHA: It's okay, everyone hates me tonight, so
were all in the same boat.

03:12:11.385 --> 03:12:13.511
MATT: All righty, ending Vax's turn, Keyleth,
you're up.

03:12:13.511 --> 03:12:15.798
MARISHA: Huh?

03:12:15.798 --> 03:12:22.860
MATT: You got shanked twice with two daggers after
the Vow of Enmity and watched your Vax vanish off

03:12:22.860 --> 03:12:24.673
somewhere in-- which direction?

03:12:24.673 --> 03:12:31.177
LIAM: The last anyone saw me is here. Keyleth saw
me here going in this direction.

03:12:31.177 --> 03:12:38.404
MATT: You watched him vanish that way right behind
the tower. What are you doing, Keyleth? Percy,

03:12:38.404 --> 03:12:39.922
you're on deck.

03:12:39.922 --> 03:12:44.137
TRAVIS: Isn't Plane Shift concentration?

03:12:44.137 --> 03:12:46.813
MATT: Plane Shift? I don't believe it is. It just
happens.

03:12:46.813 --> 03:12:48.539
MARISHA: l will look, though.

03:12:48.539 --> 03:12:51.508
MATT: Banishment is concentration, that's probably
what you were thinking of.

03:12:51.508 --> 03:12:53.324
MARISHA: I didn't have any concentration spells up
either.

03:12:53.324 --> 03:12:58.448
TRAVIS: I just meant if you get hit--

03:12:58.448 --> 03:13:00.921
MARISHA: In case you come back. Let me actually
check.

03:13:00.921 --> 03:13:02.949
MATT: Keyleth, you're fine. What you got?

03:13:02.949 --> 03:13:10.680
MARISHA: Fuck, I hope this doesn't fuck up. Peek
around the corner. Do I see Scanlan?

03:13:10.680 --> 03:13:13.684
MATT: Yeah. This whole time you see Scanlan
running up to you and telling you all this.

03:13:13.684 --> 03:13:20.583
MARISHA: (laughs) Sure. I'm going to peek around,
see Scanlan and be like: Hey, buddy!

03:13:20.583 --> 03:13:21.739
SAM: Hey!

03:13:21.739 --> 03:13:23.032
MARISHA: You see Vax?

03:13:23.032 --> 03:13:27.131
SAM: He was a blur. Came over, shot at you, and
left.

03:13:27.131 --> 03:13:29.230
MARISHA: Cool, good to know. Feeblemind!

03:13:29.230 --> 03:13:31.883
SAM: Oh shit! Counterspell level six!

03:13:31.883 --> 03:13:35.929
MARISHA: Fail. Well, you still have to roll for
it. Feeblemind level eight.

03:13:35.929 --> 03:13:43.684
MATT: Feeblemind is an 8th-level spell. Go ahead
and roll-- (laugh) Okay, hold on.

03:13:43.684 --> 03:13:48.619
SAM: Ah wait, the range is 30 feet.

03:13:48.619 --> 03:13:51.489
TALIESIN: She moved five feet.

03:13:51.489 --> 03:13:53.163
MATT: She did move up to peek, she said.

03:13:53.163 --> 03:13:55.425
MARISHA: Range for Feeblemind is 150 feet.

03:13:55.425 --> 03:13:57.064
SAM: Oh, okay. Sorry.

03:13:57.064 --> 03:14:02.635
MATT: Wait, 60-foot range for Counterspell,
right?

03:14:02.635 --> 03:14:04.280
SAM: Probably, yeah.

03:14:04.280 --> 03:14:05.459
MATT: I'm pretty sure it is.

03:14:05.459 --> 03:14:09.265
SAM: Yeah, It says range 60, it's used as a
reaction.

03:14:09.265 --> 03:14:13.128
MATT: Yeah I know, doesn't matter either way. All
right, for you it's a Counterspell.

03:14:13.128 --> 03:14:14.707
MARISHA: I should've backed up.

03:14:14.707 --> 03:14:20.033
MATT: Yeah, you should've moved. It's all good. I
need you to make an ability check using your

03:14:20.033 --> 03:14:22.078
spellcasting ability, so a charisma check.

03:14:22.078 --> 03:14:24.296
MARISHA: And what does he have to do?

03:14:24.296 --> 03:14:31.256
SAM: Wait, what? No. Counterspell is ten plus the
level, wait, what?

03:14:31.256 --> 03:14:34.758
MATT: The DC equals ten plus level of the spell.
You have to roll a check and add your charisma

03:14:34.758 --> 03:14:35.810
bonus.

03:14:35.810 --> 03:14:39.526
SAM: Got it. So that's 13 plus six is 19.

03:14:39.526 --> 03:14:42.884
MATT: 19. You need to beat 18 DC because it's an
8th-level spell you said?

03:14:42.884 --> 03:14:44.715
MARISHA: Yes.

03:14:44.715 --> 03:14:47.830
MATT: He needs to beat an 18. Counterspelled
Feeblemind.

03:14:47.830 --> 03:14:49.326
MARISHA: You rolled a 19?

03:14:49.326 --> 03:14:50.500
SAM: Yeah.

03:14:50.500 --> 03:14:54.467
MATT: So as she goes to cast Feeblemind you
recognize the incantation from when she used it on

03:14:54.467 --> 03:14:58.106
Raishan and you go--

03:14:58.106 --> 03:15:00.949
SAM: I go: Verily you are-- bad person!

03:15:00.949 --> 03:15:04.108
MATT: As the Feeblemind fades--

03:15:04.108 --> 03:15:07.770
MARISHA: Fuck! I should've fucking been out of
range!

03:15:07.770 --> 03:15:09.309
SAM: We're both making mistakes!

03:15:09.309 --> 03:15:10.514
MARISHA: We're both really good!

03:15:10.514 --> 03:15:11.349
SAM: I know.

03:15:11.349 --> 03:15:12.629
MARISHA: I respect you so much!

03:15:12.629 --> 03:15:14.793
SAM: I do too. We're making stupid mistakes
because we're so anxious.

03:15:14.793 --> 03:15:16.198
MARISHA: But we're so good.

03:15:16.198 --> 03:15:17.279
SAM: We really are.

03:15:17.279 --> 03:15:22.237
MARISHA: We're great. And then I'm going to go to
my earth elemental form. I've still got shit to

03:15:22.237 --> 03:15:35.849
do. I'm going to use my movement. Can I jump back
over and run behind the tower this way?

03:15:35.849 --> 03:15:38.179
MATT: What's the movement of your elemental
again?

03:15:38.179 --> 03:15:42.872
MARISHA: 30 feet. This way.

03:15:42.872 --> 03:15:46.279
MATT: (counting) That's as far as you can get
right there.

03:15:46.279 --> 03:15:57.753
MARISHA: Instead of curving around, can I just go
straight away from the blue thing? Just in case

03:15:57.753 --> 03:15:59.696
the blue thing hurts.

03:15:59.696 --> 03:16:01.804
MATT: What's that? You want to go around and
look?

03:16:01.804 --> 03:16:04.923
MARISHA: Instead of curving, can I just go further
from the blue thing?

03:16:04.923 --> 03:16:08.835
TALIESIN: Remember it's two points in at this
point.

03:16:08.835 --> 03:16:15.976
SAM, TALIESIN, and LIAM: (singing) What's that
blue thing doing there?

03:16:15.976 --> 03:16:21.422
TALIESIN: Oh man, we did grow up in that era,
didn't we? Oh, that brought it back.

03:16:21.422 --> 03:16:27.190
MATT: Last turn when the fields shattered, it did
cause the lighting to go off. I forgot to mention that.

03:16:27.190 --> 03:16:30.961
SAM: What lighting?

03:16:30.961 --> 03:16:31.756
MARISHA: The blue?

03:16:31.756 --> 03:16:32.345
MATT: Yes.

03:16:32.345 --> 03:16:33.719
TALIESIN: The one Scanlan was next to?

03:16:33.719 --> 03:16:36.862
MATT: Last round both of you were out of range so
I didn't mention it. I forgot about it in the

03:16:36.862 --> 03:16:38.487
process, I was focusing on the field.

03:16:38.487 --> 03:16:40.031
MARISHA: The blue thing went.

03:16:40.031 --> 03:16:40.969
MATT: Yes.

03:16:40.969 --> 03:16:42.118
MARISHA: So the circle is up next.

03:16:42.118 --> 03:16:45.472
MATT: Possibly. So are you staying in the water?

03:16:45.472 --> 03:16:53.094
MARISHA: No, if that's the case, let me step back.
Right there.

03:16:53.094 --> 03:16:55.300
MATT: I'll put you there. At the end of Scanlan's
turn--

03:16:55.300 --> 03:16:56.868
SAM: That was Keyleth's turn.

03:16:56.868 --> 03:17:04.499
MATT: Sorry, Keyleth. You watch as the water and
the two chambers flash and the chamber crushes

03:17:04.499 --> 03:17:11.876
even further. This is partially destroyed. And now
you're seeing-- we're using this as a marker--

03:17:11.876 --> 03:17:19.629
it's starting to accelerate the destruction in the
interior. Pushing this in here.

03:17:19.629 --> 03:17:23.722
LIAM: It's about to get real on the field back.

03:17:23.722 --> 03:17:30.165
SAM: Why would Colville do this to us? He's a kind
and gentle lord.

03:17:30.165 --> 03:17:38.661
MATT: Using that as a mark. That falls back to
this partially destroyed there.

03:17:38.661 --> 03:17:41.630
SAM: Wow. All this work destroyed.

03:17:41.630 --> 03:17:46.826
MATT: I know. All righty. Vax, sorry, Percival.

03:17:46.826 --> 03:17:50.989
TALIESIN: I'm going to get up right over here.

03:17:50.989 --> 03:17:55.186
MATT: I'm confused. The field should happen later
this round, but we'll get to it.

03:17:55.186 --> 03:18:00.629
TALIESIN: I'm getting up over here on this point
of the tower and I'm holding my action until I see

03:18:00.629 --> 03:18:05.887
even the slightest fucking little black feather
appear anywhere on this field and I'm going to lay

03:18:05.887 --> 03:18:07.513
goddamn waste.

03:18:07.513 --> 03:18:10.377
MATT: Okay. Ending Percival's turn, Scanlan, your
turn.

03:18:10.377 --> 03:18:22.541
SAM: I run after Keyleth and I say: Wait I forgot!
Feeblemind. I will use Wish to cast Feeblemind on her.

03:18:22.541 --> 03:18:30.997
MARISHA: All right.

03:18:30.997 --> 03:18:35.015
MATT: Keyleth, I need you to make an intelligence
saving throw.

03:18:35.015 --> 03:18:38.764
MARISHA: Just straight intelligence? Do I get
anything?

03:18:38.764 --> 03:18:41.129
MATT: Whatever your intelligence saving throw is.

03:18:41.129 --> 03:18:45.444
MARISHA: As the earth elemental? I keep my mental
stats, though.

03:18:45.444 --> 03:18:47.547
MATT: That's right, because it's Wild Shape you
keep your mental stats.

03:18:47.547 --> 03:18:52.018
MARISHA: Not that that means anything. Okay.

03:18:52.018 --> 03:18:55.840
TALIESIN: Wow. I mean he had to get clutch, didn't
he?

03:18:55.840 --> 03:18:58.602
TRAVIS: Drop that motherfucker.

03:18:58.602 --> 03:19:01.843
MARISHA: I'm trying to make sure that I don't have
any type of weird resistance--

03:19:01.843 --> 03:19:05.452
SAM: To impossible to defeat spells?

03:19:05.452 --> 03:19:07.755
(groaning)

03:19:07.755 --> 03:19:10.659
MARISHA: Terrible!

03:19:10.659 --> 03:19:13.285
MATT: So roll 4d6 psychic damage.

03:19:13.285 --> 03:19:16.095
TRAVIS: He's the king for a reason you guys.

03:19:16.095 --> 03:19:19.961
MARISHA: He tried to do what he did to me!

03:19:19.961 --> 03:19:21.510
SAM: 11.

03:19:21.510 --> 03:19:26.483
MATT: So you take 11 points of psychic damage,
Keyleth. Your intelligence and charisma scores

03:19:26.483 --> 03:19:34.176
become one. You cannot cast spells, activate magic
items, understand language or communicate in any

03:19:34.176 --> 03:19:35.568
intelligible way.

03:19:35.568 --> 03:19:38.169
MARISHA: Okay, I take how many? 11 psychic
damage?

03:19:38.169 --> 03:19:39.746
LIAM: Wow.

03:19:39.746 --> 03:19:43.211
MARISHA: So I'm at 115.

03:19:43.211 --> 03:19:46.473
TALIESIN: That's changed things, hasn't it?

03:19:46.473 --> 03:19:50.224
MATT: That's a swing cast right there.

03:19:50.224 --> 03:19:54.817
TALIESIN: You're still a player.

03:19:54.817 --> 03:19:56.124
MARISHA: I'm still going.

03:19:56.124 --> 03:19:57.014
MATT: Yeah.

03:19:57.014 --> 03:19:58.604
MARISHA: Don't count me out.

03:19:58.604 --> 03:20:00.368
TALIESIN: She's now just a barbarian.

03:20:00.368 --> 03:20:01.518
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:20:01.518 --> 03:20:02.789
TRAVIS: Can you shift into things?

03:20:02.789 --> 03:20:03.633
TALIESIN: No.

03:20:03.633 --> 03:20:04.984
MARISHA: Well, I'm currently shifted.

03:20:04.984 --> 03:20:06.361
TALIESIN: She can't unshift.

03:20:06.361 --> 03:20:09.369
MARISHA: Casting a spell isn't considered a part
of Wild Shape.

03:20:09.369 --> 03:20:12.824
MATT: Wild Shape is not casting a spell, it's an
ability. She can still Wild Shape.

03:20:12.824 --> 03:20:15.125
SAM: She can still fucking Wild Shape every turn.

03:20:15.125 --> 03:20:18.322
MARISHA: It's an inherent druid nature ability,
it's not a spell.

03:20:18.322 --> 03:20:21.076
LIAM: Would you know to do that in a frenzy?

03:20:21.076 --> 03:20:23.066
MATT: It's not a frenzy.

03:20:23.066 --> 03:20:25.509
MARISHA: Who, me?

03:20:25.509 --> 03:20:27.829
MATT: Scanlan.

03:20:27.829 --> 03:20:33.548
SAM: Yes. I'll duck somewhere so she can't see
me.

03:20:33.548 --> 03:20:39.052
MATT: We'll say you got that far. Do you move in
there?

03:20:39.052 --> 03:20:43.318
SAM: You said Feeblemind has a super long range,
right? I didn't move at all. I'm going to move

03:20:43.318 --> 03:20:45.100
back over this way.

03:20:45.100 --> 03:20:50.654
MATT: We'll put you there. It's my fault for
moving you. That finishes Scanlan's turn. Now the

03:20:50.654 --> 03:20:59.628
field crushes in where it should've before. That was my
fault for doing it out of turn. Also, the flames

03:20:59.680 --> 03:21:05.757
burst around the chamber. Percival, where are you
right now?

03:21:05.757 --> 03:21:08.459
TALIESIN: I was just inside, over here.

03:21:08.459 --> 03:21:11.444
MATT: You duck out of the way as the flames--

03:21:11.444 --> 03:21:13.329
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye out.

03:21:13.329 --> 03:21:16.475
MATT: That brings us to Vax's turn.

03:21:16.475 --> 03:21:18.712
LIAM: Okay, I need to ask a question. Here it
comes.

03:21:18.712 --> 03:21:22.341
MATT: My phone's starting to get low on battery.

03:21:22.341 --> 03:21:24.473
LIAM: I'm plugged in by a computer.

03:21:24.473 --> 03:21:31.082
MATT: Okay. Yes.

03:21:31.082 --> 03:21:42.053
LIAM: I'm going to use paladin attack-attack.
That's good. Even better. That's 33 to hit.

03:21:42.053 --> 03:21:43.883
MATT: Percival, what's your armor class?

03:21:43.883 --> 03:21:45.266
TALIESIN: 18. That's fine.

03:21:45.266 --> 03:21:55.029
MATT: Steps and is throwing daggers from the trap
door. He's inside the tower and rushed up.

03:21:55.029 --> 03:21:57.799
TALIESIN: This means I get to take my attacks.

03:21:57.799 --> 03:21:59.756
MATT: You do. After his first attack.

03:21:59.756 --> 03:22:01.034
TALIESIN: That's fine.

03:22:01.034 --> 03:22:10.808
LIAM: 38 on the first. Does he attack between my
two daggers?

03:22:10.808 --> 03:22:13.403
MATT: It's his reaction. He hits as soon as your
first attack hits.

03:22:13.403 --> 03:22:14.634
LIAM: 38 on the first.

03:22:14.634 --> 03:22:15.609
TALIESIN: How much?

03:22:15.609 --> 03:22:16.357
LIAM: 38.

03:22:16.357 --> 03:22:17.588
MATT: 38 points of piercing damage to you.

03:22:17.588 --> 03:22:18.683
TALIESIN: That's fine.

03:22:18.683 --> 03:22:20.728
LIAM: Some of it's psychic, but who's counting?

03:22:20.728 --> 03:22:25.330
MATT: Technically, no. You'd finish your action, which
is your attack action, and then he does all of his.

03:22:25.330 --> 03:22:34.296
LIAM: Good. 25. That hit?

03:22:34.296 --> 03:22:35.923
TALIESIN: 25 hits.

03:22:35.923 --> 03:22:37.446
LIAM: That's eight.

03:22:37.446 --> 03:22:39.247
MATT: Eight points of piercing damage.

03:22:39.247 --> 03:22:43.015
LIAM: I will dump venom into it. You have to
succeed a DC 15.

03:22:43.015 --> 03:22:47.378
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

03:22:47.378 --> 03:22:53.002
TALIESIN: Yeah. Like 23.

03:22:53.002 --> 03:22:59.534
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. As you throw both
daggers, you watch as Percival spins around with--

03:22:59.534 --> 03:23:00.781
which weapon?

03:23:00.781 --> 03:23:02.272
TALIESIN: I was going to use Animus.

03:23:02.272 --> 03:23:05.226
MATT: With Animus and goes for his four attacks.

03:23:05.226 --> 03:23:07.540
LIAM: Bring it.

03:23:07.540 --> 03:23:11.244
TALIESIN: I can do real attacks because this is my
real--

03:23:11.244 --> 03:23:14.694
MATT: Yeah, you were holding your action. You can
spend any grit you've got.

03:23:14.694 --> 03:23:20.933
TALIESIN: This is sharpshooter. No, he's hard to hit
the first time.

03:23:20.933 --> 03:23:26.064
MATT: He doesn't have that. Remember, Kerr took
away his cloak a long time ago.

03:23:26.064 --> 03:23:27.764
TALIESIN: Cool. Sharpshooter.

03:23:27.764 --> 03:23:32.317
LIAM: I was going to say I peeked up, but he's
sharpshooter.

03:23:32.317 --> 03:23:41.169
TALIESIN: Sharpshooter plus I'm going to do
deadeye because I really want to hit this.

03:23:41.169 --> 03:23:43.639
LIAM: You've only got four chances.

03:23:43.639 --> 03:23:46.057
TALIESIN: That crits.

03:23:46.057 --> 03:23:47.961
LIAM: What'd you roll?

03:23:47.961 --> 03:23:49.320
TALIESIN: 19.

03:23:49.320 --> 03:23:50.415
LIAM: And?

03:23:50.415 --> 03:23:51.632
TALIESIN: Three.

03:23:51.632 --> 03:23:53.983
LIAM: I'll use my last Luck. You have to reroll
the 19.

03:23:53.983 --> 03:23:55.690
TALIESIN: Can you do that?

03:23:55.690 --> 03:23:57.532
LIAM: Yes, I can. On attacks, yes I can.

03:23:57.532 --> 03:23:59.915
SAM: He's checking if you do it before the roll or
not.

03:23:59.915 --> 03:24:01.485
MATT: No.

03:24:01.485 --> 03:24:08.784
LIAM: And it's my last Luck, so your next three
are clear. Absolutely can you use Luck on other

03:24:08.784 --> 03:24:09.974
people's stuff.

03:24:09.974 --> 03:24:13.809
SAM: I am calling it now: Keyleth still wins.

03:24:13.809 --> 03:24:20.930
LIAM: And I can't remember if it's my third Luck
or fourth, so we're just going to call it my

03:24:20.930 --> 03:24:22.422
fourth Luck.

03:24:22.422 --> 03:24:25.876
MATT: You roll a d20 and choose whether.

03:24:25.876 --> 03:24:29.019
LIAM: That's a two!

03:24:29.019 --> 03:24:33.149
MATT: So the first attack misses.

03:24:33.149 --> 03:24:36.809
TALIESIN: The first attack just misses? He can
just negate it.

03:24:36.809 --> 03:24:41.002
MATT: He gets to choose whether you take his roll
or yours. He rolled a two.

03:24:41.002 --> 03:24:43.785
LIAM: You've got three more shots. Of course
you're going to shoot me.

03:24:43.785 --> 03:24:51.936
TALIESIN: I don't get my grit back, then? I
already marked it, it's fine. Let's do that again.

03:24:51.936 --> 03:24:54.150
Let's twist again like we did last summer.

03:24:54.150 --> 03:24:55.825
LIAM: Good old 11 Lucks Vax.

03:24:55.825 --> 03:25:01.428
TALIESIN: That's a 26 to hit.

03:25:01.428 --> 03:25:06.038
LIAM: Sure, that hits. I'll use Uncanny Dodge on
this one since I can see him.

03:25:06.038 --> 03:25:14.453
TALIESIN: 1d10 plus 1d6 psychic, which is three,
four, five.

03:25:14.453 --> 03:25:16.203
LIAM: First blood.

03:25:16.203 --> 03:25:23.778
TALIESIN: Where's my brain? That's 23 points.

03:25:23.778 --> 03:25:28.217
MATT: So you take 11.

03:25:28.217 --> 03:25:32.848
TALIESIN: My third hit. Here we go.

03:25:32.848 --> 03:25:34.257
MATT: You spending another grit?

03:25:34.257 --> 03:25:43.272
TALIESIN: I'm spending another grit. Yeah, it'll
be no fun. No, I'm not going to spend another

03:25:43.272 --> 03:25:52.305
grit. Still sharpshooter. That's 23 to hit.

03:25:52.305 --> 03:25:55.068
LIAM: Just hits!

03:25:55.068 --> 03:26:04.637
TALIESIN: I'm rolling so poorly. 20 points of
damage, plus five psychic, so 25.

03:26:04.637 --> 03:26:06.428
LIAM: That's first blood.

03:26:06.428 --> 03:26:14.279
TALIESIN: I can't spend an action surge in this
round, can I? On a held action.

03:26:14.279 --> 03:26:30.297
MATT: On your turn is how it happens. Double check
for you, but I'm pretty sure. On your turn.

03:26:30.297 --> 03:26:35.905
LIAM: You've got one more shot. Come on. Draw
blood.

03:26:35.905 --> 03:26:42.734
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Thunderwave instead of
shooting.

03:26:42.734 --> 03:26:46.844
MATT: Thunderwave is an action, it's not an
attack.

03:26:46.844 --> 03:26:50.908
TALIESIN: That's fair. I would have done that at
the beginning if I would have thought about it.

03:26:50.908 --> 03:27:00.662
Same thing. 15, so that hits. 26 to hit.

03:27:00.662 --> 03:27:02.424
LIAM: Definitely.

03:27:02.424 --> 03:27:07.685
TALIESIN: That's 24 points of damage.

03:27:07.685 --> 03:27:09.020
LIAM: Gotcha.

03:27:09.020 --> 03:27:14.699
MATT: That ends your reaction. That ends your
attacks. You can take the rest of your turn.

03:27:14.699 --> 03:27:18.781
LIAM: Question. Is the green beam still there?
Does it do anything? Are you going to tell me

03:27:18.781 --> 03:27:20.641
later? Just throwing it out there.

03:27:20.641 --> 03:27:25.001
MATT: You can feel the warmth around you, but it's
not doing anything immediately. You have to start

03:27:25.001 --> 03:27:26.205
your turn there.

03:27:26.205 --> 03:27:30.090
LIAM: Those were my two actions, right? I don't
need to disengage because I'm not within melee.

03:27:30.090 --> 03:27:38.294
Right back down. That was-- okay.

03:27:38.294 --> 03:27:42.828
TALIESIN: Oh, I have to roll to see if I keep my
spell. Con save.

03:27:42.828 --> 03:27:46.581
MATT: Go for it.

03:27:46.581 --> 03:27:54.163
TALIESIN: 25.

03:27:54.163 --> 03:27:57.028
MATT: 25 succeeds on the first one. Roll again for
the second one.

03:27:57.028 --> 03:28:01.107
TALIESIN: 25.

03:28:01.107 --> 03:28:05.508
MATT: You still maintain it. That finishes Vax's
turn. Keyleth, you're up.

03:28:05.508 --> 03:28:11.503
MARISHA: Do I see Vax at all? Probably not.

03:28:11.503 --> 03:28:12.676
MATT: No, you do not see Vax at all.

03:28:12.676 --> 03:28:22.940
MARISHA: I'm going to use my bonus action to turn
into a water elemental and swan dive into the

03:28:22.940 --> 03:28:34.448
water. Then I'm going to swim over to the edge of
the pond where Scanlan is. 90 feet.

03:28:34.448 --> 03:28:36.335
MATT: You're right over.

03:28:36.335 --> 03:28:39.631
MARISHA: Yep. I'm going to come out of the water
and I'm--

03:28:39.631 --> 03:28:42.414
SAM: How does she know where I am?!

03:28:42.414 --> 03:28:56.502
MARISHA: You fucking Feebleminded! I can still
see, motherfucker! I still have eyes! I'm going to

03:28:56.502 --> 03:29:00.155
come out of the water and I'm going to attempt to
whelm him.

03:29:00.155 --> 03:29:04.515
SAM: What's that even mean? Not overwhelmed, just
whelmed.

03:29:04.515 --> 03:29:09.242
MARISHA: Whelm. Make a strength saving throw.

03:29:09.242 --> 03:29:18.692
SAM: A strength saving throw. Okay. These aren't
good. 14.

03:29:18.692 --> 03:29:20.367
MARISHA: Failure!

03:29:20.367 --> 03:29:25.468
SAM: Can I Cutting Words? No, right?

03:29:25.468 --> 03:29:27.101
MATT: No, it's your own check.

03:29:27.101 --> 03:29:32.894
MARISHA: It's an attack. You take 2d8 bludgeoning
damage.

03:29:32.894 --> 03:29:35.883
MATT: You can Cutting Words to reduce the damage
if you'd like to.

03:29:35.883 --> 03:29:48.442
MARISHA: 11 plus four, so 15 damage. You are
grappled and unable to breathe.

03:29:48.442 --> 03:29:50.012
SAM: Jesus!

03:29:50.012 --> 03:29:55.355
MARISHA: Do I still have movement?

03:29:55.355 --> 03:30:02.654
MATT: You do. You have about 30 feet of movement
left. Probably about 20, since you did use some of

03:30:02.654 --> 03:30:04.922
your movement to get into the water.

03:30:04.922 --> 03:30:08.066
MARISHA: That's okay. I just want to take my
grapple with him and my whelm and take him back

03:30:08.066 --> 03:30:09.756
under into this creek.

03:30:09.756 --> 03:30:11.920
SAM: You can do that?

03:30:11.920 --> 03:30:12.885
MARISHA: Yes.

03:30:12.885 --> 03:30:16.775
SAM: You can hit, grab, and pull all on one
action?

03:30:16.775 --> 03:30:23.243
MARISHA: Whelm. It's my ability. I'm basically a
big elemental and you're stuck inside of me.

03:30:23.243 --> 03:30:28.505
SAM: But like, Bigby's Hand can either hit or
grab, not hit and grab and pull.

03:30:28.505 --> 03:30:29.867
TALIESIN: Bigby's Hand is not a beast.

03:30:29.867 --> 03:30:32.492
MATT: It's a different effect, unfortunately. Let
me see here.

03:30:32.492 --> 03:30:42.129
TALIESIN: Yeah, I forgot to bleed you. Damn. It's
okay.

03:30:42.129 --> 03:30:46.577
MATT: Yeah, you are restrained and unable to
breathe.

03:30:46.577 --> 03:30:50.227
SAM: And she's pulling me away?

03:30:50.227 --> 03:30:52.692
MARISHA: I mean, you're stuck inside of me until
further notice.

03:30:52.692 --> 03:30:58.227
MATT: Yeah, because you're whelmed and he's a tiny
gnome, yeah. So you pull him into the water. So

03:30:58.227 --> 03:31:04.443
you're in her space currently, inside Keyleth's
elemental form, unable to get out and pulled under

03:31:04.443 --> 03:31:06.819
the water. Keyleth, does that end your turn?

03:31:06.819 --> 03:31:08.335
MARISHA: Yes.

03:31:08.335 --> 03:31:09.469
MATT: Percival.

03:31:09.469 --> 03:31:15.142
MARISHA: And I'm now under the water, hiding with
Scanlan inside of my belly.

03:31:15.142 --> 03:31:18.018
LIAM: You should check hoo-ha.

03:31:18.018 --> 03:31:19.481
MATT: I'm checking.

03:31:19.481 --> 03:31:24.405
TALIESIN: I assume, because he's got five billion
feet of range, that he is long gone?

03:31:24.405 --> 03:31:31.627
MATT: You get the sense that he is not just beyond
that door.

03:31:31.627 --> 03:31:41.962
TALIESIN: Cool. I'm going to shift to the other
side of the tower, stay in the healing range, and

03:31:41.962 --> 03:31:47.126
hold my goddamn-- I'm going to run over here, stay
in the little green light, hold my fucking action

03:31:47.126 --> 03:31:50.019
until I see feather. I'm up and ready.

03:31:50.019 --> 03:31:52.123
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Percival?

03:31:52.123 --> 03:31:54.575
TALIESIN: And do I heal, since I'm in the green?

03:31:54.575 --> 03:31:59.310
MATT: No, because you started your turn out of it.
The green has to be inside the center circle.

03:31:59.310 --> 03:32:03.255
TALIESIN: In that case, I'll use my bonus action
to down a healing potion.

03:32:03.255 --> 03:32:06.244
MATT: Go for it. Scanlan, you're up.

03:32:06.244 --> 03:32:08.897
LIAM: Did the green beam do anything for me or did
it not work?

03:32:08.897 --> 03:32:11.912
MATT: You have to start your turn in the beam in
order to get the effect.

03:32:11.912 --> 03:32:22.022
SAM: So her intelligence and charisma went to one,
but her wisdom still exists? Okay. Good to know.

03:32:22.022 --> 03:32:29.031
All right. Can I use verbally-based spells?

03:32:29.031 --> 03:32:32.235
MATT: We said previously that you can still cast
underwater.

03:32:32.235 --> 03:32:42.208
SAM: Okay. Then I will cast underwater and cast
Dimension Door.

03:32:42.208 --> 03:32:44.739
MARISHA: Aw, I knew he was going to do that!

03:32:44.739 --> 03:32:46.700
TALIESIN: Does he have to be able to talk in order
to do that?

03:32:46.700 --> 03:32:47.896
SAM: We just asked that.

03:32:47.896 --> 03:32:50.677
MATT: We previously established in the kraken
battle that you guys were able to cast spells

03:32:50.677 --> 03:32:52.756
underwater. That continues here.

03:32:52.756 --> 03:33:02.018
SAM: And I will, since I don't know where I am, I
will bamf to a place that I do know, which is--

03:33:02.018 --> 03:33:10.798
where would I go? Let's go to the room across the
water over there.

03:33:10.798 --> 03:33:13.166
MATT: Which room?

03:33:13.166 --> 03:33:18.527
SAM: Right there, near the PacMan teleporter.
Yeah.

03:33:18.527 --> 03:33:20.486
MATT: Okay. Inside the room?

03:33:20.486 --> 03:33:22.298
SAM: Yeah, closer to the water's edge, but yes.

03:33:22.298 --> 03:33:34.765
MATT: Okay, there we go. All right. At the end of
your turn, the field crushes in further. It's now

03:33:34.765 --> 03:33:38.536
moving faster and faster, moving ten feet at a
time.

03:33:38.536 --> 03:33:40.582
LIAM: This is the end.

03:33:40.582 --> 03:33:44.156
TALIESIN: (singing) My only friend, the end.

03:33:44.156 --> 03:33:54.601
MATT: Well no, the lightning towers would go off,
but they do not because they have been slowly

03:33:54.601 --> 03:33:56.278
crushed and destroyed, eaten by the field.

03:33:56.278 --> 03:33:59.338
MARISHA: The blue? Does that mean it skips?

03:33:59.338 --> 03:34:07.459
LIAM: Yeah. I will use a bonus action to dump all
my Lay on Hands back into myself. So that's the

03:34:07.459 --> 03:34:11.747
first thing. And I will--

03:34:11.747 --> 03:34:13.574
MATT, TRAVIS, and TALIESIN: Bless you.

03:34:13.574 --> 03:34:17.801
LIAM: You know, I will fucking stay put. Then I'll
tell you.

03:34:17.801 --> 03:34:20.964
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, your turn.

03:34:20.964 --> 03:34:24.933
MARISHA: It's my turn already? Okay.

03:34:24.933 --> 03:34:29.333
MATT: The numbers are getting down and half the
party's just staying in place, doing nothing, so

03:34:29.333 --> 03:34:30.629
your turn.

03:34:30.629 --> 03:34:32.197
TRAVIS: Especially one of them.

03:34:32.197 --> 03:34:35.192
MARISHA: Okay, I pop my head out of the water. Do
I see anybody?

03:34:35.192 --> 03:34:39.040
MATT: Currently, no. You are alone on the
battlefield.

03:34:39.040 --> 03:34:45.696
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to switch to an earth
elemental. I'm going to come out of the water. I'm

03:34:45.696 --> 03:34:50.437
going to walk over to the edge of the tower. I'm
going to be like, fuck whoever's in this shit! And

03:34:50.437 --> 03:34:53.810
go boom, and start bringing this tower down with
my Siege Monster.

03:34:53.810 --> 03:34:56.726
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack against the
tower.

03:34:56.726 --> 03:35:02.379
MARISHA: Do I have to roll to hit still?

03:35:02.379 --> 03:35:04.350
MATT: Yes, you do.

03:35:04.350 --> 03:35:07.471
MARISHA: First attack, 14.

03:35:07.471 --> 03:35:11.753
MATT: 14 hits. It's an easy-to-hit tower. Go ahead
and roll damage.

03:35:11.753 --> 03:35:14.614
MARISHA: Okay, that's 2d8 plus five.

03:35:14.614 --> 03:35:16.067
MATT: You get two slam attacks?

03:35:16.067 --> 03:35:26.193
MARISHA: I do. That's 15, wait. Yes. 15 damage,
doubled, right? So 30? And then second attack.

03:35:26.193 --> 03:35:34.458
Much better than that. It was a natural 12, so
plus eight. So 20.

03:35:34.458 --> 03:35:36.405
MATT: Okay.

03:35:36.405 --> 03:35:37.521
TALIESIN: Yeah!

03:35:37.521 --> 03:35:48.640
MATT: So Percival, you feel this impact on the
tower. What's going on? (impact) As the back half

03:35:48.640 --> 03:35:51.519
of it begins to crumble and collapse backwards.

03:35:51.519 --> 03:35:56.504
TALIESIN: All right. I can't use any of my held
action to run, because that was not my intention.

03:35:56.504 --> 03:36:06.340
MATT: No. This all begins to fall and crumble. Oh
man, this is going to be interesting. We'll say

03:36:06.340 --> 03:36:10.522
for the purposes of this, I'll turn it this way.
Yeah, it's all falling apart at this point, which

03:36:10.522 --> 03:36:11.853
works fine.

03:36:11.853 --> 03:36:18.720
MARISHA: Fuck all y'all! I'm stupid and angry!

03:36:18.720 --> 03:36:21.962
TALIESIN: Regardless, my reaction will be to run
away from where it's falling.

03:36:21.962 --> 03:36:25.702
MATT: Yeah, this is all just falling down. There
is a little bit of this that's still hanging on

03:36:25.702 --> 03:36:33.457
there. Large portion of the tower is collapsed and
is unusable. Percival, you crumble and slide off

03:36:33.457 --> 03:36:34.875
and fall into the ground.

03:36:34.875 --> 03:36:35.903
TALIESIN: Shoes.

03:36:35.903 --> 03:36:41.016
MATT: I know. You're attaching to it as it falls
so go ahead-- Are you just staying onto it?

03:36:41.016 --> 03:36:44.135
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm holding on for dear life.

03:36:44.135 --> 03:36:48.796
MATT: All right. So you do not make an acrobatics
check and it crumbles beneath you. The rocks begin

03:36:48.796 --> 03:36:52.658
to grind and tear into you as you fall in with
it.

03:36:52.658 --> 03:36:56.015
TALIESIN: Okay, so I wouldn't try and dodge? I
don't get a dodge for any of that?

03:36:56.172 --> 03:36:59.243
MATT: Not if you're adhering to it and it
collapses inward.

03:36:59.243 --> 03:37:01.924
TALIESIN: Oh, I mean, I didn't know the situation.
I was just trying to be safe.

03:37:01.924 --> 03:37:04.524
MATT: Okay. It's falling back and then crumbling
inwards.

03:37:04.524 --> 03:37:05.677
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, no, no.

03:37:05.677 --> 03:37:07.402
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

03:37:07.402 --> 03:37:10.409
TALIESIN: Okay, sorry, yeah. I thought it was like
surfing.

03:37:10.409 --> 03:37:12.519
MATT: You were for a moment, and then it all
collapsed.

03:37:12.519 --> 03:37:18.289
TALIESIN: Acrobatics check? Come on. Oh yeah! 28!

03:37:18.289 --> 03:37:26.601
MATT: 28? Okay, yeah. So you manage to only
suffer four points of bludgeoning damage and you

03:37:26.601 --> 03:37:30.864
land, not prone, as you ride it down and are
standing there on the side, with an angry earth

03:37:30.864 --> 03:37:32.828
elemental now slamming into the sides of it.

03:37:32.828 --> 03:37:36.262
TALIESIN: 25 constitution saving throw.

03:37:36.262 --> 03:37:43.496
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, you do suffer 22 points of
bludgeoning damage from the tower pieces

03:37:43.496 --> 03:37:48.871
collapsing down upon and around you. Reduced by
half, because you're an earth elemental.

03:37:48.871 --> 03:37:50.595
TALIESIN: Do I see Vax at any point?

03:37:50.595 --> 03:37:51.756
MATT: Nope.

03:37:51.756 --> 03:37:53.285
TALIESIN: Do I see Scanlan at any point?

03:37:53.285 --> 03:37:54.570
MATT: Nope.

03:37:54.570 --> 03:37:55.531
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:37:55.531 --> 03:37:58.638
MATT: Actually, yeah, you would see Scanlan.

03:37:58.638 --> 03:37:59.864
TALIESIN: Can I take my shots?

03:37:59.864 --> 03:38:01.389
MATT: Yeah.

03:38:01.389 --> 03:38:02.530
TALIESIN: All right.

03:38:02.530 --> 03:38:03.702
SAM: How many?

03:38:03.702 --> 03:38:05.556
TALIESIN: Three. Four! Ha.

03:38:05.556 --> 03:38:09.770
SAM: He sees me?! Through all that fucking
rubble?

03:38:09.770 --> 03:38:13.505
MATT: Well, he rode it down to the ground and made
an acrobatics check to stop, and you're not

03:38:13.505 --> 03:38:14.820
hidden.

03:38:14.820 --> 03:38:16.481
SAM: I'm dead.

03:38:16.481 --> 03:38:23.117
TALIESIN: First one is sharpshooter to hit. Nope.
I take damage.

03:38:23.117 --> 03:38:25.102
MATT: A misfire?

03:38:25.102 --> 03:38:26.071
TALIESIN: That's a misfire.

03:38:26.071 --> 03:38:29.179
MATT: The first shot's a misfire. Scanlan, don't
give up yet.

03:38:29.179 --> 03:38:36.421
TALIESIN: So that's four points of psychic damage
to me, because I have half saved. Add that.

03:38:36.421 --> 03:38:45.655
That's 92 now, is what I'm at. And then, fuck
Animus. I'm going to the Retort gun for the

03:38:45.655 --> 03:38:47.642
moment.

03:38:47.642 --> 03:38:50.840
MATT: Okay, so you swap out to Retort. Second
attack.

03:38:50.840 --> 03:38:56.421
MARISHA: Oh, boo!

03:38:56.421 --> 03:38:58.296
TALIESIN: Retort's down.

03:38:58.296 --> 03:39:02.443
MATT: He goes to fire, (fizzling). Pulls the
second gun, (misfire).

03:39:02.443 --> 03:39:06.624
SAM: I hold up my gun and say, Need one,
motherfucker?

03:39:06.624 --> 03:39:14.222
TALIESIN: I can't hear you. And I pull out my last
shot. This is my last shot because I've burned

03:39:14.222 --> 03:39:15.318
everything.

03:39:15.318 --> 03:39:16.489
MATT: This is Bad News?

03:39:16.489 --> 03:39:22.608
TALIESIN: Yeah. And that's, come on, don't do this
to me. Oh, at least it's a hit. 19.

03:39:22.608 --> 03:39:24.421
MATT: 19. Scanlan, what's your AC?

03:39:24.421 --> 03:39:28.607
SAM: I'm going to Cutting Words that with my
little taunt and reduce it by--

03:39:28.607 --> 03:39:30.545
TALIESIN: I can't hear him, but okay.

03:39:30.545 --> 03:39:36.935
SAM: Oh, that's true. Never mind. Well, then I'll
Cutting Words the damage. You can do that, right?

03:39:36.935 --> 03:39:41.277
MATT: I think the target of the attack has to be
the target of the Cutting Words. Because yeah, it

03:39:41.277 --> 03:39:44.343
reduces the damage because you fuck with them.

03:39:44.343 --> 03:39:46.039
SAM: Okay. Well, then you hit.

03:39:46.039 --> 03:39:47.627
TALIESIN: It's not going to be a bad hit.

03:39:47.627 --> 03:39:51.900
SAM: They're all bad hits. Massive hit.

03:39:51.900 --> 03:39:54.211
MARISHA: That was so good!

03:39:54.211 --> 03:39:58.728
TALIESIN: 29 points of damage.

03:39:58.728 --> 03:40:05.492
MATT: You know what? "Use your wit to confuse-- a
creature that you can see within 60 feet of you

03:40:05.492 --> 03:40:06.821
"makes an attack roll."

03:40:06.821 --> 03:40:08.155
TALIESIN: Technically, I guess he could do a
visual thing.

03:40:08.155 --> 03:40:11.880
MATT: I'll let you do it. So before you put the
damage down, go ahead and roll.

03:40:11.880 --> 03:40:13.674
SAM: It's going to have to be a really good roll.

03:40:13.674 --> 03:40:14.848
MATT: We'll see.

03:40:14.848 --> 03:40:15.879
SAM: Nope.

03:40:15.879 --> 03:40:16.963
MATT: It's a d12.

03:40:16.963 --> 03:40:19.217
SAM: Oh, it's a d12! I've been doing d8s this
whole time!

03:40:19.217 --> 03:40:20.549
MATT: d12, man.

03:40:20.549 --> 03:40:22.175
TALIESIN: Oh, it's even worse!

03:40:22.175 --> 03:40:23.324
SAM: One.

03:40:23.324 --> 03:40:30.648
MATT: Yeah, so take the damage. The shot blasts
into your shoulder. You see the blood erupt from

03:40:30.648 --> 03:40:32.818
you. You've been hit by this before.

03:40:32.818 --> 03:40:35.352
SAM: Ow! Ow!

03:40:35.352 --> 03:40:38.224
MARISHA: Did you not realize?

03:40:38.224 --> 03:40:40.011
LIAM: I'm using a Sharpie, yeah.

03:40:40.011 --> 03:40:43.361
TALIESIN: Too late now, anyway! Yeah, I know, it's
like, we might as well burn it. We're burning it.

03:40:43.361 --> 03:40:47.654
MATT: Percival, that ends your turn? Scanlan.

03:40:47.654 --> 03:40:49.738
TALIESIN: Yeah. Oh, I mean, no, that's not my
turn. That was my reaction.

03:40:49.738 --> 03:40:53.256
MATT: Right, because Keyleth brought it down.

03:40:53.256 --> 03:40:56.523
TALIESIN: Yeah, so it's Keyleth's turn. Sorry.

03:40:56.523 --> 03:40:59.247
MATT: Right, because you were waiting--

03:40:59.247 --> 03:41:02.184
TALIESIN: I was holding my attack until I saw
people.

03:41:02.184 --> 03:41:09.192
MATT: Right. Okay. So that brings us to the top of
the round. Percy, it's your turn.

03:41:09.192 --> 03:41:10.984
SAM: What?! He can hold three attacks?

03:41:10.984 --> 03:41:15.469
MATT: Well, he held his action to attack as soon
as he saw somebody, and he saw you and Keyleth. He

03:41:15.469 --> 03:41:16.467
attacked you.

03:41:16.467 --> 03:41:18.261
SAM: And one attack is three?

03:41:18.261 --> 03:41:22.269
MATT: Four attacks. A 20th-level fighter, it's
their thing.

03:41:22.269 --> 03:41:24.500
MARISHA: It's what fighters do.

03:41:24.500 --> 03:41:27.515
TALIESIN: Just barely fixed my gun. Barely.

03:41:27.515 --> 03:41:28.870
MATT: All right, so that's your action.

03:41:28.870 --> 03:41:30.394
TALIESIN: And now I'm going to do an action
surge.

03:41:30.394 --> 03:41:33.748
MATT: Okay. So you fixed which one? Animus?

03:41:33.748 --> 03:41:36.844
SAM: He's going to shoot me eight times!

03:41:36.844 --> 03:41:51.045
TALIESIN: Shot number one with grit, because I'm a
little nervous about this. 26. I didn't call

03:41:51.045 --> 03:41:54.988
sharpshooter, so I'm just going to call that 31 to
hit.

03:41:54.988 --> 03:41:56.884
MATT: Okay. That hits.

03:41:56.884 --> 03:42:05.377
TALIESIN: That hits. 1d10 plus 1d6. That was
terrible. 11 points of damage.

03:42:05.377 --> 03:42:06.837
SAM: Sure, yeah.

03:42:06.837 --> 03:42:09.899
MATT: Next attack? Second?

03:42:09.899 --> 03:42:21.829
TALIESIN: So I'm all out of grit now. That's nice.
Attack number two is 28.

03:42:21.829 --> 03:42:23.984
MATT: Hits. Roll damage.

03:42:23.984 --> 03:42:29.242
TALIESIN: Oh, that's better. 17 points of damage.

03:42:29.242 --> 03:42:32.254
SAM: I will Cutting Words. Top of the round, I get
my reaction back.

03:42:32.254 --> 03:42:33.585
MATT: It hasn't come back to your turn.

03:42:33.585 --> 03:42:35.094
SAM: Then I'm dead.

03:42:35.094 --> 03:42:38.776
MATT: Scanlan goes unconscious with that second
hit.

03:42:38.776 --> 03:42:43.634
TALIESIN: Cool. I still have two attacks? I'm
going to take my movement to run over to him.

03:42:43.634 --> 03:42:49.512
TRAVIS: Shove a healing potion in his mouth.

03:42:49.512 --> 03:42:53.721
TALIESIN: That's as far as I can go?

03:42:53.721 --> 03:42:56.038
MATT: It's water and you're walking through water
right now.

03:42:56.038 --> 03:42:58.947
TALIESIN: That water freaks me out. I don't want
to quite step in that water.

03:42:58.947 --> 03:43:03.256
MATT: So you could stay up, over here.

03:43:03.256 --> 03:43:08.612
TALIESIN: Yeah, just over there. Keep me up on the
little bit because I don't want Keyleth to see me,

03:43:08.612 --> 03:43:09.929
because she's scary.

03:43:09.929 --> 03:43:13.395
MATT: I mean, she can see you. You're not hiding
from her. She's this giant behemoth.

03:43:13.395 --> 03:43:17.101
TALIESIN: Okay, I would like to curl a little bit
then out of her range of vision.

03:43:17.101 --> 03:43:20.597
MATT: You're out of movement right there. That's
as far as you will get.

03:43:20.597 --> 03:43:21.951
MARISHA: I know exactly where you are.

03:43:21.951 --> 03:43:23.095
TALIESIN: I know.

03:43:23.095 --> 03:43:25.581
MATT: And she can sense it. She feels the
footfalls.

03:43:25.581 --> 03:43:32.180
TALIESIN: I have two more shots? All right, I'm
taking a shot-- actually, unconscious, I don't get

03:43:32.180 --> 03:43:38.235
grit back? It's death I get grit back. All right,
so, taking another-- but when he dies I get a

03:43:38.235 --> 03:43:39.212
grit.

03:43:39.212 --> 03:43:41.207
MATT: Okay. He's prone, technically, so you have
disadvantage on the attack.

03:43:41.207 --> 03:43:47.990
TALIESIN: Oh, well then, hm. Fuck it, then. I'll
hold my attacks and use my bonus action to do a

03:43:47.990 --> 03:43:49.521
heal.

03:43:49.521 --> 03:43:50.678
SAM: On me?

03:43:50.678 --> 03:43:51.671
TALIESIN: No, on me.

03:43:51.671 --> 03:43:52.678
SAM: Aw.

03:43:52.678 --> 03:43:57.454
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I'm done. I'm just getting my
1d10.

03:43:57.454 --> 03:44:00.571
MATT: Scanlan, I need you to make a death saving
throw, please.

03:44:00.571 --> 03:44:02.843
SAM: 17.

03:44:02.843 --> 03:44:07.222
MATT: All right, so that's one success. Keep that
in mind. All right.

03:44:07.222 --> 03:44:09.055
TALIESIN: 22 back.

03:44:09.055 --> 03:44:17.850
MATT: The fields (crushing). Another ten feet. I'm
using this to mark how deep in it's getting now.

03:44:17.850 --> 03:44:21.984
So we'll say there.

03:44:21.984 --> 03:44:25.103
TALIESIN: So that's 194. I'm back up to 194.

03:44:25.103 --> 03:44:36.480
MATT: Also, the water, which is now filled with
bits of broken stone, however still sets off.

03:44:36.480 --> 03:44:37.994
TALIESIN: That's why I didn't step in it.

03:44:37.994 --> 03:44:39.423
MARISHA: That's a good call.

03:44:39.423 --> 03:44:41.600
MATT: That brings us to your turn.

03:44:41.600 --> 03:44:47.282
LIAM: So from my hidden position, I would like to
use ten or 15 feet of movement, whatever I would

03:44:47.282 --> 03:44:51.325
need to peek out and throw Whisper at Percival's
face.

03:44:51.325 --> 03:44:52.952
TALIESIN: How would he even know where I am?

03:44:52.952 --> 03:44:58.951
LIAM: Well, I would peek out. I'm looking around
and I know that I would see you. I was in here and

03:44:58.951 --> 03:45:00.264
I'm hidden.

03:45:00.264 --> 03:45:02.692
MATT: Well, you were hidden until you attacked,
which revealed you there.

03:45:02.692 --> 03:45:04.612
LIAM: Isn't it a sneak attack from a hidden
position?

03:45:04.612 --> 03:45:08.101
MATT: It is, but once you hit him, he sees you.
This is just for placement. I want to put you on

03:45:08.101 --> 03:45:10.332
the field once or twice this battle!

03:45:10.332 --> 03:45:17.148
LIAM: I know! So I'm using Whisper. That's good,
that's a 25 to hit.

03:45:17.148 --> 03:45:18.475
TALIESIN: That hits.

03:45:18.475 --> 03:45:28.353
LIAM: I'll bamf to him as I do it. It's sneak
attack damage. That is nine plus that is 11. Plus

03:45:28.353 --> 03:45:29.707
all these guys.

03:45:29.707 --> 03:45:31.272
TALIESIN: None of this is magic, is it?

03:45:31.272 --> 03:45:33.103
LIAM: Some of it's psychic.

03:45:33.103 --> 03:45:41.118
MATT: Unfortunately, all the big spellcasters are
either down or can't cast spells.

03:45:41.118 --> 03:45:48.699
LIAM: That's 40 points of damage. And this is my
paladin attack, so that was one. I'm going to use

03:45:48.699 --> 03:45:54.558
the other attack with Whisper, I've still got it,
to throw it at Keyleth's face. Which I will do.

03:45:54.558 --> 03:46:08.940
That definitely hits. That is a 31. Right. So not
a lot of damage, though. (counting) That's 15 of

03:46:08.940 --> 03:46:18.989
damage. That was maybe 15 feet of movement,
paladin attack-attack and I say: Oh!

03:46:18.989 --> 03:46:21.520
MATT: Did you bamf to her as well?

03:46:21.520 --> 03:46:32.497
LIAM: Yeah. It really pains me. It really does. I
use bonus action to disengage. I have most of my

03:46:32.497 --> 03:46:42.736
original movement and hasted action left.
Disengage. You guys don't know where I went.

03:46:42.736 --> 03:46:43.901
MARISHA: You disengaged?

03:46:43.901 --> 03:46:45.295
LIAM: Yeah.

03:46:45.295 --> 03:46:53.159
SAM: You know what I would have done on the third
attack? First blood. You did a lot of nothing

03:46:53.159 --> 03:46:55.269
damage to both of them and then hid.

03:46:55.269 --> 03:46:57.482
MARISHA: Kind of.

03:46:57.482 --> 03:47:02.945
MATT: That ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.

03:47:02.945 --> 03:47:06.019
MARISHA: Do I see Percy? Oh wait, I can feel him.

03:47:06.019 --> 03:47:07.204
MATT: You can feel him, yes.

03:47:07.204 --> 03:47:18.429
SAM: You'll never win, Vax! Scanlan from the
grave!

03:47:18.429 --> 03:47:22.844
TALIESIN: I'm going to point out, by the way, I
don't think I've actually attacked you.

03:47:22.844 --> 03:47:24.613
MARISHA: Me?

03:47:24.613 --> 03:47:25.732
TALIESIN: Yeah. Just saying.

03:47:25.732 --> 03:47:27.101
MARISHA: Are you thinking that's going to save
you?

03:47:27.101 --> 03:47:27.989
TALIESIN: No.

03:47:27.989 --> 03:47:28.946
MARISHA: Okay.

03:47:28.946 --> 03:47:30.561
TALIESIN: I'm making plans.

03:47:30.561 --> 03:47:36.260
MARISHA: What do I want to do with you?

03:47:36.260 --> 03:47:38.272
TALIESIN: That is a question.

03:47:38.272 --> 03:47:54.217
MARISHA: That is such a question. What's next?
Next is the fire, right? Oh. Hang on.

03:47:54.217 --> 03:48:00.783
MATT: Keyleth, top of your turn. You feel two
footfalls very gently in the rubble on the other

03:48:00.783 --> 03:48:02.735
side of the tower.

03:48:02.735 --> 03:48:09.787
MARISHA: Can I make my way to them?

03:48:09.787 --> 03:48:11.195
MATT: If you'd like to.

03:48:11.195 --> 03:48:12.195
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:48:12.195 --> 03:48:13.780
MATT: What's your movement here?

03:48:13.780 --> 03:48:24.125
MARISHA: Here's the question. Since I know kind of
where he is, can I use my bonus action to turn

03:48:24.125 --> 03:48:25.785
into a fire elemental and go to him?

03:48:25.785 --> 03:48:26.857
MATT: Yeah.

03:48:26.857 --> 03:48:32.117
MARISHA: I'm going to do that. My fire elemental
movement is 50 feet.

03:48:32.117 --> 03:48:42.494
TALIESIN: She looks like she's about to fire a
mortar into a compound.

03:48:42.494 --> 03:48:49.230
MATT: You, moving 50 feet, through the rubble,
since you can move through small spaces, right?

03:48:49.230 --> 03:49:01.277
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Actually, shit, I didn't mean
fire. I meant water. If that's doable. It's fine.

03:49:01.277 --> 03:49:02.504
I already called it.

03:49:02.504 --> 03:49:04.361
MATT: If you want to do water elemental, you can.

03:49:04.361 --> 03:49:05.703
MARISHA: No, I already called it.

03:49:05.703 --> 03:49:26.964
MATT: Okay. Fire elemental. You (counting). Vax.
You were hiding up in the rubble.

03:49:26.964 --> 03:49:31.038
LIAM: That's not where I am. I just sent it to
you. You asked me and I told you.

03:49:31.038 --> 03:49:33.842
MATT: You sent me two pictures.

03:49:33.842 --> 03:49:38.760
LIAM: You asked for clarification. I give it to
you. So no one would see me as you put me where I

03:49:38.760 --> 03:49:41.615
am. Why would she be able to go in there?

03:49:41.615 --> 03:49:45.024
MATT: She knows exactly where you are and as a
fire elemental, she can dodge between cracks.

03:49:45.024 --> 03:49:46.370
LIAM: Did she run out of movement, though?

03:49:46.370 --> 03:49:48.485
MARISHA: I have 50 feet, yo.

03:49:48.485 --> 03:49:49.741
LIAM: Kill me.

03:49:49.741 --> 03:49:53.349
MARISHA: So pouty!

03:49:53.349 --> 03:49:55.222
LIAM: I knew it was going to happen!

03:49:55.222 --> 03:50:02.737
MATT: As you're sitting there hiding, there's a
bright light and there's a slight crevasse between

03:50:02.737 --> 03:50:09.372
the rocks as a flaming burst of fire elemental
Keyleth emerges to assault you. What're you

03:50:09.372 --> 03:50:10.553
doing?

03:50:10.553 --> 03:50:18.124
MARISHA: First, I'm going to enter your space
immediately and you take 1d10 fire damage and you

03:50:18.124 --> 03:50:37.550
catch on fire. Seven damage. Two touch attacks.
I'm doing both attacks at once here. First attack

03:50:37.550 --> 03:50:38.831
is 22.

03:50:38.831 --> 03:50:40.381
LIAM: Nope.

03:50:40.381 --> 03:50:43.716
MARISHA: Second attack doesn't hit either, then.

03:50:43.716 --> 03:50:49.163
MATT: She swipes with one fire claw, you barely
dodge out of the way. A second one hits the stone

03:50:49.163 --> 03:50:50.763
behind you as you duck low.

03:50:50.763 --> 03:50:52.526
TALIESIN: But he's on fire.

03:50:52.526 --> 03:50:53.952
MARISHA: But you're on fire.

03:50:53.952 --> 03:50:56.102
LIAM: Tonight in this game.

03:50:56.102 --> 03:50:57.619
MARISHA: Do I have any more movement?

03:50:57.619 --> 03:51:00.623
MATT: It took you most of your movement to get there.
You have five feet of movement.

03:51:00.623 --> 03:51:05.794
MARISHA: Can I move through this crack on the
other side here?

03:51:05.794 --> 03:51:09.112
MATT: I'll allow it.

03:51:09.112 --> 03:51:11.540
MARISHA: Sorry, boom mics.

03:51:11.540 --> 03:51:31.005
MATT: With the rubble and everything in here... Ending
Keyleth's turn, Percival, you're up.

03:51:31.005 --> 03:51:35.662
TALIESIN: I'm making a mad dash for Scanlan.

03:51:35.662 --> 03:51:44.136
MATT: Okay. (counting)

03:51:44.136 --> 03:51:47.078
TALIESIN: I can't make a jump to see if I can
get a little further across there?

03:51:47.078 --> 03:51:48.174
MATT: What's your strength?

03:51:48.174 --> 03:51:50.457
TALIESIN: My strength sucks. My strength is 12.

03:51:50.457 --> 03:51:58.852
MATT: You jump and land. You're up to your chest
in water.

03:51:58.852 --> 03:52:02.204
TALIESIN: I'm going to use the rest of my action
to continue to run towards Scanlan.

03:52:02.204 --> 03:52:04.008
MATT: You're going to use an action to dash?

03:52:04.008 --> 03:52:09.901
TALIESIN: Use an action to dash. Can I get a
little further, or is that as far as I can get?

03:52:09.901 --> 03:52:12.122
MATT: Maybe five more feet.

03:52:12.122 --> 03:52:14.577
TALIESIN: I want to be on the other side of him,
if that's okay.

03:52:14.577 --> 03:52:17.233
MATT: You can get to there.

03:52:17.233 --> 03:52:18.557
TALIESIN: That'll do.

03:52:18.557 --> 03:52:20.720
MATT: That's your turn?

03:52:20.720 --> 03:52:21.712
TALIESIN: That's my turn.

03:52:21.712 --> 03:52:23.860
MATT: Scanlan. Death saving throw.

03:52:23.860 --> 03:52:25.078
SAM: 11.

03:52:25.078 --> 03:52:35.693
MATT: You're fine. That's two successes. The field
crushes in further. Slowly pushing in. At this

03:52:35.693 --> 03:52:38.497
point, by the way, so you're aware, Percival.

03:52:38.497 --> 03:52:40.672
TALIESIN: I thought I had a little bit of room.

03:52:40.672 --> 03:52:50.607
MATT: You have a little bit, this whole chamber.
Let me use this to mark it here. That's where it's

03:52:50.607 --> 03:52:56.522
closing in. Closer and closer. Vax, your turn.

03:52:56.522 --> 03:52:58.918
MARISHA: Wait, when is it the top of the round?

03:52:58.918 --> 03:53:01.744
MATT: It just went. That was Percival.

03:53:01.744 --> 03:53:03.388
MARISHA: Did the torches go, or no?

03:53:03.388 --> 03:53:09.770
MATT: No, they go after Scanlan's turn, now, the
field. You're right. Thank you for the reminder.

03:53:09.770 --> 03:53:11.755
TALIESIN: Hey, look at that!

03:53:11.755 --> 03:53:13.523
MARISHA: Sorry, I'm totally helping the DM.

03:53:13.523 --> 03:53:15.510
TALIESIN: No, you're killing Vax! Well done!

03:53:15.510 --> 03:53:26.942
MATT: Valid point. The area around the tower
ignites in flame. You're immune to fire, Keyleth.

03:53:26.942 --> 03:53:29.240
I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.

03:53:29.240 --> 03:53:37.493
LIAM: Right. I get advantage. 29.

03:53:37.493 --> 03:53:40.895
MATT: That's a success. You take no damage because
of evasion.

03:53:40.895 --> 03:53:43.027
MARISHA: Ballsacks.

03:53:43.027 --> 03:53:45.436
LIAM: Is it my turn?

03:53:45.436 --> 03:53:48.423
MATT: Your turn.

03:53:48.423 --> 03:53:50.863
LIAM: I'm separated with a wall from her a
little bit.

03:53:50.863 --> 03:53:53.554
MATT: Slight gap in the wall.

03:53:53.554 --> 03:53:58.891
LIAM: I'm going to skitter five or ten feet. I
know she can hear me, but he can't. Then I'm going

03:53:58.891 --> 03:54:04.439
to use a little more movement. This looks like a
hole, so I'll floof out to about here. I'll

03:54:04.439 --> 03:54:12.867
paladin attack-attack Percival from the air over
the water. Yeah. Oh, that's not very good. That's

03:54:12.867 --> 03:54:14.039
18.

03:54:14.039 --> 03:54:15.558
TALIESIN: That's my armor class.

03:54:15.558 --> 03:54:21.580
LIAM: Hits. The second attack is not, so it
doesn't hit, but the first one does and it's sneak

03:54:21.580 --> 03:54:42.046
attack. That's 18 plus these guys. Here we go.
(counting) 40.

03:54:42.046 --> 03:54:44.124
MATT: 40 points of piercing damage to you.

03:54:44.124 --> 03:54:50.091
LIAM: One attack hit, one missed. I used bonus
action to hide, a little bit of movement to get

03:54:50.091 --> 03:54:54.481
here, attack-attack. So I have hasted action and a
lot more movement left. I'll use the rest of my

03:54:54.481 --> 03:55:00.567
base movement to go. I will tell you where I'm
going.

03:55:00.567 --> 03:55:02.263
SAM: You're going to heal me.

03:55:02.263 --> 03:55:03.568
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

03:55:03.568 --> 03:55:07.476
MATT: Ending Vax's turn. Keyleth, you're up.

03:55:07.476 --> 03:55:36.534
MARISHA: Okay. Blue, that's gone. I know he's
around here somewhere, yeah? Over around this side.

03:55:36.534 --> 03:55:39.527
MATT: Yes. You felt a little (clicking).

03:55:39.527 --> 03:55:46.427
MARISHA: Can I jump into the water and swim around
as a water elemental and see if I can get to this

03:55:46.427 --> 03:55:47.927
other side?

03:55:47.927 --> 03:55:53.612
MATT: You turn into a water elemental.

03:55:53.612 --> 03:56:07.836
MARISHA: This might not be the best call. If I get
around here, can I poke my head up and see if I

03:56:07.836 --> 03:56:09.409
find him?

03:56:09.409 --> 03:56:11.376
MATT: I have to wait to find out.

03:56:11.376 --> 03:56:17.001
MARISHA: I just projected where I was going to be,
though, he could just change his fucking mind!

03:56:17.001 --> 03:56:20.182
LIAM: He projected my position four times tonight.
It's just the nature of the game, man.

03:56:20.182 --> 03:56:21.624
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:56:21.624 --> 03:56:38.235
MARISHA: Don't sext him while you're at it!
Jesus!

03:56:38.235 --> 03:56:45.693
SAM: The new campaign will be all texts.

03:56:45.693 --> 03:56:50.518
MATT: Never mind. You felt no (clicking). Instead,
he just disappeared from sight. You saw him go

03:56:50.518 --> 03:56:54.407
this direction, but you have no idea where he is.
Do you want to remain fire elemental?

03:56:54.407 --> 03:57:03.374
MARISHA: Well, I was jumping into water elemental
to go around, but if I don't feel him land, then

03:57:03.374 --> 03:57:10.967
I'll go earth elemental. Let me start stomping up
and over and seeing what I see.

03:57:10.967 --> 03:57:15.362
MATT: Sure. I'll let you step up over rough
terrain.

03:57:15.362 --> 03:57:17.181
MARISHA: (grumbling)

03:57:17.181 --> 03:57:19.373
MATT: Dashing through.

03:57:19.373 --> 03:57:23.091
MARISHA: Okay. Do I see anything? Do I see any flying
asshole rogues?

03:57:23.091 --> 03:57:27.170
MATT: You don't see anything.

03:57:27.170 --> 03:57:29.279
LIAM: It's my only mechanic.

03:57:29.279 --> 03:57:31.141
MATT: Percival.

03:57:31.141 --> 03:57:33.767
MARISHA: It's a good mechanic!

03:57:33.767 --> 03:57:39.727
TALIESIN: This is probably the best use of this.
I'm going to use my action surge. I'm going to

03:57:39.727 --> 03:57:44.491
hold my action, but I'm going to use my action
surge. I can use an action surge instead of

03:57:44.491 --> 03:57:49.305
holding my action. Just to stab this fucker three
times.

03:57:49.305 --> 03:57:51.457
MARISHA: Brutal!

03:57:51.457 --> 03:57:57.442
MATT: The first attack. Roll an attack with
advantage because he's on the ground.

03:57:57.442 --> 03:58:00.170
SAM: I'm prone. I get half!

03:58:00.170 --> 03:58:02.861
MATT: Only against ranged attacks.

03:58:02.861 --> 03:58:07.165
TALIESIN: 29.

03:58:07.165 --> 03:58:10.928
MATT: That hits. It's an auto-crit. You fail two
death saving throws.

03:58:10.928 --> 03:58:17.594
TALIESIN: Here goes the second one. 29.

03:58:17.594 --> 03:58:20.637
MATT: And with that, you shank Scanlan.

03:58:20.637 --> 03:58:22.636
TALIESIN: Oh look, I get a grit back.

03:58:22.636 --> 03:58:26.358
MATT: Scanlan bleeds out.

03:58:26.358 --> 03:58:28.629
SAM: Who will tell my story?

03:58:28.629 --> 03:58:31.149
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Not me.

03:58:31.149 --> 03:58:34.026
TALIESIN: I'm not proud of this. I'm never telling
anyone. I'm like: I don't know, he ran off. I am

03:58:34.026 --> 03:58:48.224
going to move out into this direction over here
because I know the walls are caving in. I have 30

03:58:48.224 --> 03:58:56.364
movement. I'm going to move right over here to
start getting out of the way.

03:58:56.364 --> 03:58:57.854
MATT: Over where?

03:58:57.854 --> 03:58:59.089
TALIESIN: Around the corner.

03:58:59.089 --> 03:59:00.623
MATT: The wall's up against there.

03:59:00.623 --> 03:59:14.078
TALIESIN: In that case, I'll head that direction.
(counting) I'm holding my action for the second I

03:59:14.078 --> 03:59:16.833
see anyone start to fuck with me.

03:59:16.833 --> 03:59:18.339
MATT: You already used your action.

03:59:18.339 --> 03:59:22.257
TALIESIN: That was my action surge.

03:59:22.257 --> 03:59:25.404
MATT: Oh. Action surge first. You hold your action
in case you see anything.

03:59:25.404 --> 03:59:26.650
MARISHA: That's a good idea.

03:59:26.650 --> 03:59:28.282
TALIESIN: I can do a lot of damage now.

03:59:28.282 --> 03:59:29.828
MATT: End of Percival's turn.

03:59:29.828 --> 03:59:33.206
TALIESIN: Just have to bet that I can plow
damage.

03:59:33.206 --> 03:59:42.360
MATT: The water bursts with magical energy. No, it
was fire last time, so now it's lightning. Blue

03:59:42.360 --> 03:59:55.653
things are gone, nothing happens. Also, it crushes
in once more. Bringing us to there. Currently, the

03:59:55.653 --> 03:59:59.240
walls have crushed in.

03:59:59.240 --> 04:00:13.197
TALIESIN: I always knew it would be the three of
us.

04:00:13.197 --> 04:00:14.907
SAM: You did?

04:00:14.907 --> 04:00:16.783
TALIESIN: No. I just always wanted to say that.

04:00:16.783 --> 04:00:18.469
LIAM: You always said it would be Grog and
Keyleth.

04:00:18.525 --> 04:00:20.637
MARISHA: Yeah, I thought it was going to be
me and Grog again.

04:00:20.637 --> 04:00:22.971
TRAVIS: With all the magic that I have?

04:00:22.971 --> 04:00:24.341
TALIESIN: If you had gotten your hands on
anybody--

04:00:24.341 --> 04:00:27.984
MARISHA: Yeah, if you had closed the gap, that's
it. That's down for any of us.

04:00:27.984 --> 04:00:30.927
TRAVIS: Disengage. Shift. Element. You just (poof)
right out of it.

04:00:30.927 --> 04:00:35.540
TALIESIN: And also, can I mention, isn't he still
on fire? Make it harder to--

04:00:35.540 --> 04:00:37.633
LIAM: Matt. One.

04:00:37.633 --> 04:00:45.108
MATT: One. Okay. So, couple things. One, roll 1d10
fire damage, Marisha, by the way.

04:00:45.108 --> 04:00:47.732
TALIESIN: Thank you. Lead him out.

04:00:47.732 --> 04:00:51.344
MARISHA: Nine.

04:00:51.344 --> 04:00:53.150
MATT: Technically twice, since you didn't do it
last turn, right?

04:00:53.150 --> 04:00:54.695
LIAM: I was about to say, I didn't stop drop and
roll or anything. Literally about to say.

04:00:54.695 --> 04:00:55.880
MATT: It's an action to put it out.

04:00:55.880 --> 04:00:56.860
LIAM: Yeah, so I didn't do it.

04:00:56.860 --> 04:00:58.011
MATT: So, nine fire damage, and then roll again.

04:00:58.011 --> 04:01:01.407
MARISHA: So nine now, and then another four. So,
13.

04:01:01.407 --> 04:01:02.481
LIAM: 13. Got it.

04:01:02.481 --> 04:01:06.190
MATT: And then you fail your constitution saving
throw as the wall slams into you, pushing you

04:01:06.190 --> 04:01:23.173
back. Oof. You take 28 points of force damage, and
you are thrown, prone onto the ground right

04:01:23.173 --> 04:01:24.100
there.

04:01:24.100 --> 04:01:25.164
LIAM: Great.

04:01:25.164 --> 04:01:29.182
MATT: That ends that turn. Vax, your turn.

04:01:29.182 --> 04:01:32.676
LIAM: Okay. I will use movement to get up.

04:01:32.676 --> 04:01:34.010
MATT: Half your movement.

04:01:34.010 --> 04:01:39.216
LIAM: Half my, 60 feet of movement to stand up,
got it. And I will fly low along the ground--

04:01:39.216 --> 04:01:40.606
MATT: Also Vax--

04:01:40.606 --> 04:01:43.710
LIAM: Are the boots off?

04:01:43.710 --> 04:01:45.396
MATT: The boots are off.

04:01:45.396 --> 04:01:51.206
LIAM: Okay. So it's not 60, the wings are up, so
30 feet to get up.

04:01:51.206 --> 04:01:52.669
MATT: Correct.

04:01:52.669 --> 04:01:55.745
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god.

04:01:55.745 --> 04:02:06.065
LIAM: 30 feet to get about-- I don't know, can I
perch there? Flying low? I should be within 60

04:02:06.065 --> 04:02:16.489
feet of Kiki, and I have Vow of Enmity still, so I
will attack-attack-attack.

04:02:16.489 --> 04:02:21.885
MATT: Yeah, you can barely see her. You just
barely have her in range. Percy. You watch as he

04:02:21.885 --> 04:02:23.091
glides in the air--

04:02:23.091 --> 04:02:24.604
TALIESIN: Oh, hey, I got a shot!

04:02:24.604 --> 04:02:28.838
LIAM: This is here, this is here. There's a gap
there?

04:02:28.838 --> 04:02:30.919
TALIESIN: Yeah, but you wouldn't have flown up to
your perch.

04:02:30.919 --> 04:02:32.445
LIAM: Okay.

04:02:32.445 --> 04:02:33.833
TALIESIN: I will take my shot.

04:02:33.833 --> 04:02:36.439
MARISAH: Out of the shadows, boy!

04:02:36.439 --> 04:02:37.990
LIAM: Everybody hates me.

04:02:37.990 --> 04:02:40.080
MATT: Everybody hates each other!

04:02:40.080 --> 04:02:42.805
TALIESIN: First shot.

04:02:42.805 --> 04:02:49.513
MARISHA: As the internet said earlier, we're really bad at
shit-talking each other. Just embrace it.

04:02:49.513 --> 04:02:52.385
TALIESIN: First shot, I'm burning my grit for a
Sharpshooter.

04:02:52.385 --> 04:02:54.421
MATT: She's been Feebleminded! Don't play Woe is
Me!

04:02:54.421 --> 04:02:56.355
TALIESIN: Going to burn my grit for a Sharpshooter
in hopes of really doing some damage.

04:02:56.355 --> 04:02:58.919
MATT: He got Plane Shifted, he got shanked by
Percival! You're doing all right!

04:02:58.919 --> 04:03:01.288
TRAVIS: First time we've seen you in three hours and 45
minutes.

04:03:01.352 --> 04:03:02.966
TALIESIN: 25 to hit.

04:03:02.966 --> 04:03:06.102
LIAM: That probably hits a lot.

04:03:06.102 --> 04:03:07.610
SAM: First blood!

04:03:07.610 --> 04:03:21.407
TALIESIN: Here, I'm using good dice for this. Oh
yeah. 28 plus six psychic, so 34 points of

04:03:21.407 --> 04:03:22.555
damage.

04:03:22.555 --> 04:03:24.693
LIAM: I can use Uncanny Dodge on that, since I can
see him if he can see me.

04:03:24.693 --> 04:03:25.925
MATT: Correct.

04:03:25.925 --> 04:03:27.212
LIAM: So, half that.

04:03:27.212 --> 04:03:28.452
TALIESIN: Half of 34.

04:03:28.452 --> 04:03:34.578
MATT: That would be 17. Next attack?

04:03:34.578 --> 04:03:35.978
TALIESIN: Next attack.

04:03:35.978 --> 04:03:37.254
MARISHA: Kill him!

04:03:37.254 --> 04:03:45.779
TALIESIN: Oh, goddamn it. Animus is down. That was
a 20. Bad News comes out. That's a third attack.

04:03:45.779 --> 04:03:48.050
Come on, Gil.

04:03:48.050 --> 04:03:50.414
MARISHA: Is that a crit?

04:03:50.414 --> 04:03:51.669
TALIESIN: No, it's not a crit.

04:03:51.669 --> 04:03:52.830
MARISHA: Damn it, so close.

04:03:52.830 --> 04:03:55.522
TALIESIN: That's a 27 to hit.

04:03:55.522 --> 04:03:56.863
LIAM: Yeah, you're good.

04:03:56.863 --> 04:03:58.992
TALIESIN: Where are my dice for that?

04:03:58.992 --> 04:04:02.429
MARISHA: Not that I'm cheering on for your death
or anything.

04:04:02.429 --> 04:04:03.451
LIAM: Yes, you are.

04:04:03.451 --> 04:04:06.100
MARISHA: I'm just excited. I'm excitable.

04:04:06.100 --> 04:04:07.951
TALIESIN: That's 26 points of damage.

04:04:07.951 --> 04:04:09.649
MATT: 26 points of piercing damage.

04:04:09.649 --> 04:04:12.035
TALIESIN: I can't use a bonus to reload, can I?

04:04:12.035 --> 04:04:13.703
MATT: Nope. Not your turn.

04:04:13.703 --> 04:04:15.249
TALIESIN: So I just reloaded. All right.

04:04:15.249 --> 04:04:18.787
MATT: So your last attack is to reload.

04:04:18.787 --> 04:04:21.594
SAM: I cast Slowly Decompose.

04:04:21.594 --> 04:04:25.034
TRAVIS: I cast Waterlogged.

04:04:25.034 --> 04:04:27.229
MATT: Okay, so now you land there, and can make
your attacks on him.

04:04:27.229 --> 04:04:29.169
LIAM: It's still my turn. Oh, wow, that's
amazing.

04:04:29.169 --> 04:04:30.585
MATT: Yep. That was his reaction.

04:04:30.585 --> 04:04:44.793
LIAM: Dagger dagger dagger. Yeah, that's a 30 to
hit. Oh, it doesn't matter, because I've got Vow

04:04:44.793 --> 04:04:48.117
of Enmity up. I was going to say am I still
hidden, but I've got Vow of Enmity. That is sneak

04:04:48.117 --> 04:04:50.097
attack on that. That's 30.

04:04:50.097 --> 04:04:55.033
MARISHA: Oh, Scanlan! We could have been pit
fiends together! But I got Feebleminded! Oh no!

04:04:55.033 --> 04:04:58.288
And you died! We waited too long!

04:04:58.288 --> 04:05:00.713
MATT: I had these minions at the ready, just in
case!

04:05:00.713 --> 04:05:01.918
SAM: Aww!

04:05:01.918 --> 04:05:03.510
MARISHA: We were going to be awesome!

04:05:03.510 --> 04:05:05.129
TRAVIS: That would've been fun.

04:05:05.129 --> 04:05:11.702
MATT: I know. Pit fiend on a full melee round
against a single target can do an average of 115

04:05:11.702 --> 04:05:14.461
hit points of damage and lock down healing.

04:05:14.461 --> 04:05:16.100
LIAM: 44 on the first.

04:05:16.100 --> 04:05:17.244
MARISHA: Damage?

04:05:17.244 --> 04:05:22.696
LIAM: 44 damage on the first? Does 18 hit?

04:05:22.696 --> 04:05:25.858
MARISHA: Yes. Pretty much everything hits these
motherfuckers.

04:05:25.858 --> 04:05:44.390
LIAM: You get ten on that. 28 on the third, also
hits. That is 12 on the third.

04:05:44.390 --> 04:05:49.311
MATT: You've used all your movement.

04:05:49.311 --> 04:05:54.888
LIAM: Yeah, I'm done because I'm not hasted any
more. I used half to stand up and the other half

04:05:54.888 --> 04:06:02.322
to get there. I used-- it's complicated, folks.
Paladin attack-attack and bonus to do a third

04:06:02.322 --> 04:06:03.533
attack. So I'm done.

04:06:03.533 --> 04:06:06.450
MATT: Keyleth, your turn.

04:06:06.450 --> 04:06:20.115
MARISHA: All right! Let's dance! I jump. As I
jump, I'm going to turn into a water elemental.

04:06:20.115 --> 04:06:25.382
Ker-splash. Then use my movement speed to
come up. I'm going to try to whelm Vax.

04:06:25.382 --> 04:06:29.736
MATT: A leap there would be 20 feet of movement.

04:06:29.736 --> 04:06:32.132
MARISHA: With my dope mantle.

04:06:32.132 --> 04:06:36.386
LIAM: She's not so dumb that she thinks she's an
earth elemental forever?

04:06:36.386 --> 04:06:41.180
MARISHA: I'm an archdruid!

04:06:41.180 --> 04:06:44.850
LIAM: You have an intelligence of one.

04:06:44.850 --> 04:06:49.344
MATT: Marisha, technically your mantle isn't on
you right now because you're in elemental form.

04:06:49.344 --> 04:06:54.262
MARISHA: Beast Shape says that anything that's on
me absorbs into me.

04:06:54.262 --> 04:06:55.515
MATT: Absorbs into your form.

04:06:55.515 --> 04:06:58.521
MARISHA: And elemental is my form.

04:06:58.521 --> 04:07:04.225
MATT: But you're not getting your ring of
protection bonus, you're not getting your other

04:07:04.225 --> 04:07:07.529
elements that you have in physical form. They stay
within you so when you transform back, the effects

04:07:07.529 --> 04:07:12.336
return, but you don't get the Jump ability. What's
the strength of this guy?

04:07:12.336 --> 04:07:15.813
MARISHA: 20 strength.

04:07:15.813 --> 04:07:17.137
MATT: Oh yeah.

04:07:17.137 --> 04:07:19.713
LIAM: Suddenly, five rules lawyers around the
table.

04:07:19.713 --> 04:07:30.680
MATT: Water elemental there. I'll say half your
movement to get into the water, the jump. Turn

04:07:30.680 --> 04:07:32.062
into a water elemental.

04:07:32.062 --> 04:07:33.185
MARISHA: How much speed do I have left?

04:07:33.185 --> 04:07:34.297
MATT: Half of your swim speed.

04:07:34.297 --> 04:07:36.291
MARISHA: So 45. Can I get to Vax?

04:07:36.291 --> 04:07:41.087
MATT: (counting)

04:07:41.087 --> 04:07:42.709
LIAM: Oh, difficult terrain!

04:07:42.709 --> 04:07:45.190
MARISHA: I can swim! I'm a fucking water
elemental!

04:07:45.190 --> 04:07:48.430
MATT: You're just in melee range with him.

04:07:48.430 --> 04:07:53.969
MARISHA: Blub blub blub! Whelm again.

04:07:53.969 --> 04:07:56.353
MATT: Do you have to move into his space for
whelm?

04:07:56.353 --> 04:08:03.798
MARISHA: Each creature in the elemental's space.
So yes.

04:08:03.798 --> 04:08:05.720
MATT: He's unfortunately just out.

04:08:05.720 --> 04:08:09.953
MARISHA: Then I'll do my two slam attacks. Bam
bam.

04:08:09.953 --> 04:08:11.732
TALIESIN: He's low, man.

04:08:11.732 --> 04:08:14.474
MATT: You're just out of range for being whelmed,
so that's good.

04:08:14.474 --> 04:08:20.298
SAM: Weirdly, taking away all of Keyleth's
intelligence has made her a more effective

04:08:20.298 --> 04:08:21.608
fighter.

04:08:21.608 --> 04:08:31.323
MARISHA: 20. Misses. I've got to roll high in
order to actually get you. That's even better!

04:08:31.323 --> 04:08:32.526
25!

04:08:32.526 --> 04:08:34.210
MATT: Roll damage.

04:08:34.210 --> 04:08:45.418
MARISHA: Roll, baby! 17 points of damage.

04:08:45.418 --> 04:08:46.969
LIAM: Uncanny dodge.

04:08:46.969 --> 04:08:48.993
TRAVIS: So casual.

04:08:48.993 --> 04:08:53.595
MATT: You take eight points of bludgeoning damage
from the water.

04:08:53.595 --> 04:08:57.461
MARISHA: Okay. That's it.

04:08:57.461 --> 04:09:00.978
MATT: That brings us to Percival.

04:09:00.978 --> 04:09:09.325
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and fix my gun with my
roll.

04:09:09.325 --> 04:09:12.424
MATT: This is your action.

04:09:12.424 --> 04:09:15.218
TALIESIN: And boy that does it.

04:09:15.218 --> 04:09:19.685
SAM: It's so fixed.

04:09:19.685 --> 04:09:27.863
TALIESIN: Sometimes it'll really break. I'm going
to make my way up on top of that tower.

04:09:27.863 --> 04:09:29.430
MATT: Right there?

04:09:29.430 --> 04:09:30.906
TALIESIN: Yeah. A little closer.

04:09:30.906 --> 04:09:35.528
MATT: Just so you know, the force field is right
there.

04:09:35.528 --> 04:09:41.617
TALIESIN: Oh, never mind. I thought it was a
little further back. I'm going to try to cross the

04:09:41.617 --> 04:09:44.382
water and get back to the other side of the water
again.

04:09:44.382 --> 04:09:51.092
MATT: (counting) Right there.

04:09:51.092 --> 04:09:55.417
TALIESIN: That'll do it. Just let the two of them
settle their differences.

04:09:55.417 --> 04:10:02.319
MARISHA: Not a bad call.

04:10:02.319 --> 04:10:10.850
MATT: Now, the energy fields burst with purple
energy.

04:10:10.850 --> 04:10:12.688
MARISHA: Was so hoping I was going to have Vax in
that water.

04:10:12.688 --> 04:10:19.532
MATT: Actually, they don't! They've been destroyed
by the fields, so they do not have an effect any more.

04:10:19.532 --> 04:10:21.895
MARISHA: It's just us kids.

04:10:21.895 --> 04:10:31.045
MATT: Which saves you because that would have
knocked out your form. However, the fields move in

04:10:31.045 --> 04:10:34.001
further, completely destroying this here.

04:10:34.001 --> 04:10:35.855
TALIESIN: I am so excited by this.

04:10:35.855 --> 04:10:37.859
LIAM: I'm going to be dead. I'm a dead man.

04:10:37.859 --> 04:10:52.397
MATT: This all goes away. Just the edge of the
water now. We're in on this area now. Vax, it's

04:10:52.397 --> 04:10:53.469
your turn.

04:10:53.469 --> 04:10:58.462
LIAM: I would like to paladin attack Keyleth with
Vow of Enmity twice. The first one is a natural

04:10:58.462 --> 04:11:16.721
20. Let's just calculate that, shall we? That's
one. Get all the dice first. (counting) Not that

04:11:16.721 --> 04:11:22.519
great, actually. That is 58 for the first attack.

04:11:22.519 --> 04:11:24.906
MATT: 58 damage to your water elemental.

04:11:24.906 --> 04:11:35.690
MARISHA: Wait, is that magical? No, it's straight
damage, right?

04:11:35.690 --> 04:11:39.199
LIAM: Eight psychic and double on all the dice.

04:11:39.199 --> 04:11:44.615
MATT: Magical dagger attacks, so you do not
resist.

04:11:44.615 --> 04:11:46.323
MARISHA: What was the first one, 56?

04:11:46.323 --> 04:11:47.571
LIAM: 58.

04:11:47.571 --> 04:12:11.509
MARISHA: That's not right, either! No, that is
right.

04:12:11.509 --> 04:12:13.178
MATT: You can't see Percival.

04:12:13.178 --> 04:12:17.128
MARISHA: What was the other one?

04:12:17.128 --> 04:12:18.912
LIAM: 14.

04:12:18.912 --> 04:12:24.937
SAM: Can't be done! Don't you get it? The math's
not there! You have to deliver more than 200

04:12:24.937 --> 04:12:31.783
points of damage in a single round to kill her!
You can't do it without us! The math is not

04:12:31.783 --> 04:12:33.112
there!

04:12:33.112 --> 04:12:35.761
LIAM: So that was paladin attack-attack. I'll use
disengage.

04:12:35.761 --> 04:12:41.465
TRAVIS: Fly into the wall. Do it. Burn yourself
up, every inch.

04:12:41.465 --> 04:12:48.472
LIAM: I don't want to do the phone thing. I'm going
to fly 60 feet, but Percy doesn't see me. She

04:12:48.472 --> 04:12:59.289
does. I fly to about here. 60 feet. I'm on the
other side of this tower.

04:12:59.289 --> 04:13:01.299
MATT: You disengaged from her.

04:13:01.299 --> 04:13:03.270
LIAM: Disengage and then my movement of 60 feet.

04:13:03.270 --> 04:13:10.300
MATT: All right. That ends Vax's turn. Keyleth,
you're up.

04:13:10.300 --> 04:13:12.279
LIAM: Here she comes.

04:13:12.279 --> 04:13:15.708
MARISHA: Yep! I'm going for that motherfucker
right there!

04:13:15.708 --> 04:13:18.721
LIAM: Percy would have shot me out of it. I stay
low.

04:13:18.721 --> 04:13:33.274
MATT: Technically, on that side, there is no water
there. This is all gone. This has all been eaten

04:13:33.274 --> 04:13:36.986
away. You'd have to get up onto the land there.

04:13:36.986 --> 04:13:44.100
MARISHA: Then let me go earth elemental and walk
on over to him.

04:13:44.100 --> 04:13:46.607
MATT: You can move partially.

04:13:46.607 --> 04:13:51.246
MARISHA: There we go.

04:13:51.246 --> 04:13:56.115
MATT: That's as far as you can right there.

04:13:56.115 --> 04:13:58.305
MARISHA: Total? I can't get any further?

04:13:58.305 --> 04:14:01.665
MATT: Nope. With a 30 feet speed for an earth
elemental, right?

04:14:01.665 --> 04:14:02.742
MARISHA: Yes.

04:14:02.742 --> 04:14:03.985
MATT: That's as close as you can get.

04:14:03.985 --> 04:14:06.863
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah.

04:14:06.863 --> 04:14:12.077
MATT: That's your turn? You still have an action.

04:14:12.077 --> 04:14:17.945
MARISHA: There's nothing I can do as an earth
elemental with Feeblemind.

04:14:17.945 --> 04:14:21.647
MATT: You can use your action to dash towards him
if you wanted to.

04:14:21.647 --> 04:14:33.520
MARISHA: Sure. I'll get right up in his face. I
can't grapple him? I can't do anything?

04:14:33.520 --> 04:14:37.330
MATT: The field's up against there, so
technically he had to fly around and land.

04:14:37.330 --> 04:14:39.092
LIAM: Is it just this island left now, Matt?

04:14:39.092 --> 04:14:40.106
MATT: Yep!

04:14:40.106 --> 04:14:42.663
MARISHA: Okay, wait. Is it all the way up into
here?

04:14:42.663 --> 04:14:43.952
MATT: Yeah.

04:14:43.952 --> 04:14:50.965
MARISHA: Sorry. I don't mean to retroact things.
If that's the case, can I do an air elemental and

04:14:50.965 --> 04:14:52.090
fly over?

04:14:52.090 --> 04:14:54.413
MATT: Sure, you can do that.

04:14:54.413 --> 04:14:58.717
TALIESIN: This system's a little confusing.

04:14:58.717 --> 04:15:00.026
MATT: I know, my apologies.

04:15:00.026 --> 04:15:01.597
TALIESIN: You're doing great.

04:15:01.597 --> 04:15:02.949
LIAM: We're vamping.

04:15:02.949 --> 04:15:10.593
MARISHA: In that case, let me do a fire elemental,
if that's okay, and then I'll go 50 feet. I've got

04:15:10.593 --> 04:15:12.658
50 feet of movement and I can move through
one-inch spaces.

04:15:12.658 --> 04:15:19.686
MATT: You can just get up to where he is.

04:15:19.686 --> 04:15:22.999
MARISHA: Can I get in his space and catch him on
fire immediately?

04:15:22.999 --> 04:15:24.803
TALIESIN: He's already on fire still.

04:15:24.803 --> 04:15:26.957
LIAM: It's your third try at a form, dude.

04:15:26.957 --> 04:15:28.402
MARISHA: Are you still on fire?

04:15:28.402 --> 04:15:29.468
MATT: Yeah.

04:15:29.468 --> 04:15:30.538
MARISHA: Should I have rolled again?

04:15:30.538 --> 04:15:31.528
MATT: You should have taken damage last turn.

04:15:31.528 --> 04:15:32.641
LIAM: I'm probably down, then.

04:15:32.641 --> 04:15:33.953
MARISHA: Six points of damage.

04:15:33.953 --> 04:15:35.071
LIAM: I'm unconscious.

04:15:35.071 --> 04:15:36.427
MATT: As you land--

04:15:36.427 --> 04:15:37.977
TALIESIN: You can burn him out.

04:15:37.977 --> 04:15:44.443
MATT: He's smoldering on the ground. You go over
to where Vax is, and he's just burning. His

04:15:44.443 --> 04:15:46.413
unconscious body is burning.

04:15:46.413 --> 04:15:53.262
MARISHA: I go: Hey, Scanlan, I found him! I found
Vax! Scanlan?

04:15:53.262 --> 04:15:57.408
MATT: You look over and see on the field that's
pushing forward, there's a Scanlan corpse being

04:15:57.408 --> 04:16:00.119
rolled as it shoves him closer onto the
battlefield.

04:16:00.119 --> 04:16:01.761
SAM: First! Blood!

04:16:01.761 --> 04:16:07.022
LIAM: Is there water? The water's gone.

04:16:07.022 --> 04:16:11.509
MATT: The water's over here. We'll put you there.

04:16:11.509 --> 04:16:13.096
MARISHA: He's on fire.

04:16:13.096 --> 04:16:15.313
MATT: Percy, your turn.

04:16:15.313 --> 04:16:16.810
MARISHA: I can still attack him.

04:16:16.810 --> 04:16:19.542
MATT: The corpse? Yeah, you can. Go for it.

04:16:19.542 --> 04:16:21.608
LIAM: I thought you used all your shit to get
there.

04:16:21.608 --> 04:16:23.675
MARISHA: No, I just walked there.

04:16:23.675 --> 04:16:25.452
LIAM: Okay, cool.

04:16:25.452 --> 04:16:28.463
SAM: And Grog just suffocated.

04:16:28.463 --> 04:16:33.650
MATT: Nah, he's got constitution for days. He's
got five more minutes on this shit.

04:16:33.650 --> 04:16:40.610
MARISHA: What do I have to roll to hit him, by the
way? He's down and unconscious, so do I have to roll?

04:16:40.610 --> 04:16:42.282
LIAM: It's two death saves per.

04:16:42.282 --> 04:16:44.333
MATT: Melee, you have advantage to attack him.

04:16:44.333 --> 04:16:51.084
LIAM: I'm not going to dodge sleeping.

04:16:51.084 --> 04:16:54.490
TALIESIN: You're literally sitting on him. You're
going to burn him.

04:16:54.490 --> 04:16:57.655
MARISHA: Yeah, both of my attacks hit.

04:16:57.655 --> 04:17:00.321
MATT: His body incinerates.

04:17:00.321 --> 04:17:03.140
MARISHA: I just sit on him, I'm like: Sorry!

04:17:03.140 --> 04:17:05.201
MATT: Yeah, each time.

04:17:05.201 --> 04:17:06.842
SAM: Oh, each time and she hit him twice?

04:17:06.842 --> 04:17:09.761
MATT: Hit him twice. So Vax's body burns away.

04:17:09.761 --> 04:17:13.054
LIAM: I'm two out of three. She's got to hit me
one more time.

04:17:13.054 --> 04:17:15.275
MATT: Oh, that was just the first hit? I thought
you hit him with both.

04:17:15.275 --> 04:17:16.587
MARISHA: I hit him twice.

04:17:16.587 --> 04:17:18.552
LIAM: Oh, so the first one's two. Peace!

04:17:18.552 --> 04:17:20.199
MATT: Both attacks. You're incinerated.

04:17:20.199 --> 04:17:21.796
TALIESIN: I'm a little fucked, but we'll see how
this goes.

04:17:21.796 --> 04:17:23.714
SAM: A little?! You. Can't. Win!

04:17:23.714 --> 04:17:26.634
MARISHA: Sorry, boo.

04:17:26.634 --> 04:17:35.586
TALIESIN: It's okay. Do you have the sensory?
Anytime you turn to rock, you can tell where I am,

04:17:35.586 --> 04:17:41.876
so it doesn't really matter. I'm going to drop
Silence. I'm going to use my bonus action to cast.

04:17:41.876 --> 04:17:43.119
Can I see her?

04:17:43.119 --> 04:17:44.117
MATT: Yeah.

04:17:44.117 --> 04:17:50.791
TALIESIN: I'm casting Hex. I'm taking three shots
from where I'm standing with Animus.

04:17:50.791 --> 04:17:51.898
MATT: Not four?

04:17:51.898 --> 04:18:01.339
TALIESIN: Four, god, I'm just getting used to it.
Four sharpshooter. Number one is 19 to hit.

04:18:01.339 --> 04:18:06.370
MARISHA: Hit. I'm really easy to hit.

04:18:06.370 --> 04:18:17.836
TALIESIN: Oh shit, that's pretty good. That's 27
normal points of damage. Five psychic and five

04:18:17.836 --> 04:18:18.893
necrotic.

04:18:18.893 --> 04:18:20.471
MARISHA: So 37 total?

04:18:20.471 --> 04:18:21.270
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:18:21.270 --> 04:18:25.161
MARISHA: What's the first one, is it piercing?

04:18:25.161 --> 04:18:26.482
TALIESIN: Piercing.

04:18:26.482 --> 04:18:28.640
MARISHA: Which I take half of because it's not
magical.

04:18:28.640 --> 04:18:31.227
MATT: It is magical because you're shooting with
Animus.

04:18:31.227 --> 04:18:34.144
TALIESIN: Oh, so I don't have to break this up.
This is magical damage.

04:18:34.144 --> 04:18:37.545
MARISHA: So 37 total? Okay.

04:18:37.545 --> 04:18:48.470
TALIESIN: Shot number two. Come on, man, this is
all I need. Fucking fuck fuck. I take two psychic

04:18:48.470 --> 04:18:51.644
damage as it jams. I'm jamming a lot.

04:18:51.644 --> 04:18:53.995
SAM: I'm jamming!

04:18:53.995 --> 04:18:57.449
TALIESIN: Shot number three is Bad News, which is
not magic.

04:18:57.449 --> 04:18:59.205
SAM: We jamming!

04:18:59.205 --> 04:19:07.788
TALIESIN: 25 to hit.

04:19:07.788 --> 04:19:09.327
MATT: That hits.

04:19:09.327 --> 04:19:13.186
TALIESIN: It's not awesome because you take half
damage because it's piercing.

04:19:13.186 --> 04:19:14.294
LIAM: First blood.

04:19:14.294 --> 04:19:19.489
TALIESIN: It's 26 points of piercing damage.

04:19:19.489 --> 04:19:23.203
MATT: Plus d6 necrotic. So 13.

04:19:23.203 --> 04:19:26.461
TALIESIN: Plus one necrotic.

04:19:26.461 --> 04:19:27.931
MATT: 14 points of damage.

04:19:27.931 --> 04:19:38.447
TALIESIN: I'm going to run up the tower. No,
straight up the tower. Spider boots.

04:19:38.447 --> 04:19:43.623
MATT: I know, there's fire there. You get there.

04:19:43.623 --> 04:19:47.750
TALIESIN: I want to get out of the way of the fire
when it finally rolls. Trying to get inside of it.

04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:56.278
SAM: Can you get to the middle and stay there
until the whole island kills her?

04:19:56.278 --> 04:19:58.846
MARISHA: I mean, I can do that too.

04:19:58.846 --> 04:20:08.266
MATT: End of Percy's turn. The field crushes in
even further, which unfortunately does hit you,

04:20:08.266 --> 04:20:11.126
Keyleth. You get pushed in. Make a constitution
saving throw.

04:20:11.126 --> 04:20:18.852
MARISHA: Just a straight con save? Don't fuck me,
Gil. That's good. 20 total.

04:20:18.852 --> 04:20:26.453
MATT: 20, okay. You do succeed. So you take, wow
that's a good roll. Six, six, six, six, five, two,

04:20:26.453 --> 04:20:38.036
four. No, against you. 29 divided, so that's 14
points of force damage. You're now being crushed

04:20:38.036 --> 04:20:41.778
into the rubble and pushed up the top of it.

04:20:41.778 --> 04:20:43.233
MARISHA: Okay.

04:20:43.233 --> 04:20:48.846
SAM: Would you say she's jamming? Into the wall?

04:20:48.846 --> 04:20:50.945
MATT: She's jamming pretty hard into that wall.

04:20:50.945 --> 04:20:53.975
MARISHA: Whose turn is it?

04:20:53.975 --> 04:20:57.705
MATT: That is the field's turn over. It's
Keyleth's turn. You're up.

04:20:57.705 --> 04:21:00.149
MARISHA: So wait, what did the field just do?

04:21:00.149 --> 04:21:02.893
MATT: It's crushing you guys inward.

04:21:02.893 --> 04:21:04.943
MARISHA: Did it do the torch or did the torch
already happen?

04:21:04.943 --> 04:21:10.227
MATT: The torch unfortunately could not because
the territory that it would be on-- I mean, the

04:21:10.227 --> 04:21:15.164
torch goes off, I would say, but you're immune to
fire and Percival's out of the way, and only part

04:21:15.164 --> 04:21:18.126
of it is currently available. It's crushing it
very tight.

04:21:18.126 --> 04:21:21.748
MARISHA: Cool. Cool cool cool.

04:21:21.748 --> 04:21:23.703
TALIESIN: And you took damage from the force
field.

04:21:23.703 --> 04:21:25.529
MATT: So it's your turn, Keyleth.

04:21:25.529 --> 04:21:27.242
MARISHA: I'm going to go earth elemental.

04:21:27.242 --> 04:21:28.663
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

04:21:28.663 --> 04:21:30.215
MATT: Okay.

04:21:30.215 --> 04:21:44.902
MARISHA: Oh yeah! I'm going to jump all over,
Kool-Aid man style, do a big old fatty jump leap.

04:21:44.902 --> 04:21:50.769
Or, if I can get to Percy?

04:21:50.769 --> 04:21:55.000
MATT: You won't get to him with your movement,
unfortunately, because there's a lot of rubble in

04:21:55.000 --> 04:21:56.280
the way.

04:21:56.280 --> 04:21:59.208
MARISHA: Okay. I can't jump over it?

04:21:59.208 --> 04:22:07.259
MATT: You do, but your movement-- You can't jump
more than you can move when you don't have the

04:22:07.259 --> 04:22:08.358
cloak on.

04:22:08.358 --> 04:22:09.854
MARISHA: Am I within ten feet of him?

04:22:09.854 --> 04:22:12.079
MATT: He's about 15 feet from you.

04:22:12.079 --> 04:22:19.150
MARISHA: Fuck! Okay. That's it, then.

04:22:19.150 --> 04:22:21.514
MATT: All right. Percival, you're up.

04:22:21.514 --> 04:22:28.769
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and fix my gun because
it's the only chance I have. Oh, just barely makes

04:22:28.769 --> 04:22:40.044
it. Yep. And then, since I don't have an attack,
man, there's nothing I can do. I'm going to run on

04:22:40.044 --> 04:22:45.703
the outskirts on the outside of the tower, behind,
and get some cover.

04:22:45.703 --> 04:22:49.210
MATT: Here?

04:22:49.210 --> 04:22:54.990
TALIESIN: Yeah, on the wall. I'm literally on the
wall. It won't crush next round, will it? I mean,

04:22:54.990 --> 04:23:02.964
at current rate, I'm not doing anything dumb? I
mean, I would know, though, if it's been going at--

04:23:02.964 --> 04:23:04.502
MATT: You get the sense that, on this side, it
will, but not on this side--

04:23:04.502 --> 04:23:05.785
TALIESIN: So yeah.

04:23:05.785 --> 04:23:15.393
MATT: End of Percival's turn, it crushes in again.
Now keeping tabs on where it lies. There is the

04:23:15.393 --> 04:23:22.496
edge. There, and then on this side, it's right up
against you, Percival.

04:23:22.496 --> 04:23:24.519
SAM: It's cramming!

04:23:24.519 --> 04:23:30.261
MATT: Keyleth, your turn.

04:23:30.261 --> 04:23:32.040
MARISHA: Can I move five feet to reach him?

04:23:32.040 --> 04:23:36.868
MATT: Yeah. You can get up on top there and bash
downward, essentially.

04:23:36.868 --> 04:23:44.181
SAM: Do it!

04:23:44.181 --> 04:23:48.520
MARISHA: He still has a decent amount of hit
points, though.

04:23:48.520 --> 04:23:51.989
SAM: Yeah, but you can draw &lt;i&gt;first blood&lt;/i&gt;.

04:23:51.989 --> 04:24:02.404
MARISHA: This is a force wall. If I throw him into
it, it's going to suck?

04:24:02.404 --> 04:24:06.381
TALIESIN: It's not that bad. I've hit it three
times already.

04:24:06.381 --> 04:24:09.240
MATT: Yeah, him and Grog have been thrown into it
a few times earlier.

04:24:09.240 --> 04:24:10.722
SAM: Crush him!

04:24:10.722 --> 04:24:19.484
MARISHA: Okay, can I grapple him and pummel the
shit out of him?

04:24:19.484 --> 04:24:21.727
MATT: Yeah, if you want to grapple with the first
attack.

04:24:21.727 --> 04:24:23.227
MARISHA: I'm going to grapple with the first
attack.

04:24:23.227 --> 04:24:24.727
MATT: All right, I need you both to make athletics
checks, please.

04:24:24.727 --> 04:24:26.768
SAM: That's you.

04:24:26.768 --> 04:24:27.871
TALIESIN: Yep.

04:24:27.871 --> 04:24:32.290
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil! That's not bad.

04:24:32.290 --> 04:24:33.505
TALIESIN: I'm seven.

04:24:33.505 --> 04:24:34.751
MARISHA: 19.

04:24:34.751 --> 04:24:38.224
MATT: So the first attack, she reaches down and
grabs you. Now, the giant elemental form has

04:24:38.224 --> 04:24:41.719
wrapped its fingers around your shoulders and
torso. You're unable to move from the spot.

04:24:41.719 --> 04:24:46.155
MARISHA: Do one more attack on him. Do I get
advantage on the grappling?

04:24:46.155 --> 04:24:50.871
MATT: Your movement is zero. Hm? Your next attack,
you attack him. You don't get advantage.

04:24:50.871 --> 04:25:01.154
MARISHA: I just attack him? Not good. Sorry, 12.

04:25:01.154 --> 04:25:02.401
TALIESIN: That won't hit me.

04:25:02.401 --> 04:25:04.988
MATT: Nope, so you're held there in space.
Percival.

04:25:04.988 --> 04:25:09.157
TALIESIN: Thunderwave, 5th-level.

04:25:09.157 --> 04:25:11.847
SAM: You can do 5th-level spells?

04:25:11.847 --> 04:25:13.053
TALIESIN: Yep.

04:25:13.053 --> 04:25:14.687
SAM: Damn!

04:25:14.687 --> 04:25:16.861
MATT: Thunderwave from which one?

04:25:16.861 --> 04:25:20.296
TALIESIN: From my Stone King Cincture.

04:25:20.296 --> 04:25:23.820
MATT: That's true. All righty. So go ahead and
make, what's the saving throw on that?

04:25:23.820 --> 04:25:25.917
TALIESIN: DC 16.

04:25:25.917 --> 04:25:29.536
MATT: DC 16 constitution. Go ahead and make a
constitution saving throw, Keyleth.

04:25:29.536 --> 04:25:36.466
MARISHA: Saved with a natural 18.

04:25:36.466 --> 04:25:40.396
SAM: It's 6d8 halved thunder damage.

04:25:40.396 --> 04:25:42.499
MATT: And she gets pushed, or does she not get
pushed?

04:25:42.499 --> 04:25:43.957
SAM: No. Because she saved, she doesn't get
pushed.

04:25:43.957 --> 04:25:45.404
MATT: Okay, so still grappled.

04:25:45.404 --> 04:26:02.491
TALIESIN: 6d8? All right. Halved. (counting) 29
halved.

04:26:02.491 --> 04:26:06.056
MATT: Right, so 14. End of your turn, Percival?

04:26:06.056 --> 04:26:12.828
TALIESIN: That counts as a whole attack, doesn't
it? Then I'm going to run-- I can't. She's got me.

04:26:12.828 --> 04:26:14.990
I can't even attempt to break free.

04:26:14.990 --> 04:26:20.054
MATT: Actually, you could have, but you spent it to
cast Thunderwave. It would've if she had failed

04:26:20.054 --> 04:26:21.361
the save.

04:26:21.361 --> 04:26:24.795
TALIESIN: I don't get to add a d6 to that of hex
damage, do I?

04:26:24.795 --> 04:26:26.407
MATT: Technically you do, yeah.

04:26:26.407 --> 04:26:29.414
TALIESIN: Hey, six points of necrotic.

04:26:29.414 --> 04:26:34.424
LIAM: Oh no, she's down to 106.

04:26:34.424 --> 04:26:36.371
SAM: Until the next turn.

04:26:36.371 --> 04:26:37.683
TALIESIN: I'm still higher.

04:26:37.683 --> 04:26:39.055
MARISHA: You are still higher.

04:26:39.055 --> 04:26:43.379
TALIESIN: Actually, no, I'm not. Never mind. I'm
at 107. So yeah! One point higher.

04:26:43.379 --> 04:26:52.765
MATT: Percival, top of your turn. This side stops
closing in. This side does. Percy, you are now

04:26:52.765 --> 04:27:01.296
being smashed between the wall of the tower and
the field as she's holding you in space. I need

04:27:01.296 --> 04:27:05.339
you both to make constitution saving throws as
you're having to hold him there to keep him in

04:27:05.339 --> 04:27:10.223
space. But you have advantage because you're
pulling away, I'll say.

04:27:10.223 --> 04:27:16.385
TALIESIN: Yeah, 18. So it's 26.

04:27:16.385 --> 04:27:17.979
MARISHA: 17.

04:27:17.979 --> 04:27:25.101
MATT: All right, So you fail. You do get pushed
back 15 feet and you take, oh man. All right.

04:27:25.101 --> 04:27:26.365
That's a good roll.

04:27:26.365 --> 04:27:29.145
TALIESIN: Technically, since I'm grappled, do I go
with her?

04:27:29.145 --> 04:27:36.665
MATT: No, because it breaks the grapple because it
pushes you back. So that's 30 points of force

04:27:36.665 --> 04:27:43.541
damage to you, Keyleth. 15 to you. However, you
are currently restrained as you are being held

04:27:43.541 --> 04:27:49.830
against the wall and the force field. You're
pushed back.

04:27:49.830 --> 04:27:52.246
MARISHA: Oh, and he's stuck?

04:27:52.246 --> 04:27:58.047
MATT: He's being sandwiched between the stone wall
and the force field, like (crackling). We're

04:27:58.047 --> 04:28:03.680
talking like Tetsuo-crush. All right.

04:28:03.680 --> 04:28:05.432
TALIESIN: It's my turn now, right? Or no?

04:28:05.432 --> 04:28:06.872
MATT: No, now it's Keyleth's turn.

04:28:06.872 --> 04:28:11.869
SAM: And that's when the Irresistible Dance kicks
in. Delayed response.

04:28:11.869 --> 04:28:23.967
MARISHA: Can I take and through this wall, push it
and start crushing Percy? Two slam attacks with

04:28:23.967 --> 04:28:25.691
the wall, crush crush?

04:28:25.691 --> 04:28:27.931
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm into that.

04:28:27.931 --> 04:28:32.158
MATT: All right, so go ahead and make an attack.

04:28:32.158 --> 04:28:35.734
MARISHA: Against the wall or against Percy?

04:28:35.734 --> 04:28:36.919
MATT: Against the wall.

04:28:36.919 --> 04:28:41.796
MARISHA: First one is a 20 total. No, 21 total.
The second one is a 19 total.

04:28:41.796 --> 04:28:50.243
MATT: Okay. I won't have you roll damage because
it's siege, but what you do is each one of these

04:28:50.243 --> 04:28:55.116
shoves forces him into the wall. So I need you to
make two constitution saving throws.

04:28:55.116 --> 04:29:04.312
TALIESIN: Two constitution saving throws. Here we
go. That's a 19 and a 21.

04:29:04.312 --> 04:29:17.240
MATT: Both succeed. So that's 27 points of force
damage, reduced to 13.

04:29:17.240 --> 04:29:19.990
TALIESIN: Okay, so that's 92 minus 13.

04:29:19.990 --> 04:29:27.685
MATT: That's a shitty roll. Ten points of force
damage, reduced to five.

04:29:27.685 --> 04:29:29.199
TALIESIN: 74.

04:29:29.199 --> 04:29:32.186
MARISHA: Does he take any from being sandwiched?

04:29:32.186 --> 04:29:34.314
MATT: I mean, he's taking the damage because he's
being sandwiched.

04:29:34.314 --> 04:29:37.846
MARISHA: Okay. Can I use my bonus action to go
earth elemental again?

04:29:37.846 --> 04:29:40.171
MATT: You have to change to a different form.

04:29:40.171 --> 04:29:44.507
MARISHA: Then I will stay.

04:29:44.507 --> 04:29:46.559
MATT: Okay. Percival, your turn.

04:29:46.559 --> 04:29:48.591
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and squeeze around out
of this.

04:29:48.591 --> 04:29:51.445
MATT: Top of your turn, make a constitution saving
throw.

04:29:51.445 --> 04:30:01.005
TALIESIN: Oh, fine. Natural 20. I really would've
liked that on a shot, but that's okay. It would

04:30:01.005 --> 04:30:02.648
have made life way easier.

04:30:02.648 --> 04:30:11.006
MATT: That is 19 points of force damage, reduced
to nine. Right, so you're trying to escape from

04:30:11.006 --> 04:30:18.931
the restraint? All right, make an athletics check.
Athletics or acrobatics, I believe. Let me double

04:30:18.931 --> 04:30:20.506
check real fast.

04:30:20.506 --> 04:30:23.754
TALIESIN: If I can just use my boots to squeeze
off the side--

04:30:23.754 --> 04:30:29.215
MATT: Well no, it's not breaking from a grapple
necessarily. It's from being pinned. This isn't

04:30:29.215 --> 04:30:33.591
weaseling out of it. This is pure force, so this
would be athletics.

04:30:33.591 --> 04:30:35.378
TALIESIN: I can't try and sneak through the
window?

04:30:35.378 --> 04:30:42.085
MATT: No, the window, it's a slit. It's like that
wide and your back is pressed against it.

04:30:42.085 --> 04:30:50.154
TALIESIN: This is not how I wanted to go out.
Athletics, then? Oh boy. Nope.

04:30:50.154 --> 04:30:52.324
MATT: All right, so you're still restrained.

04:30:52.324 --> 04:30:55.357
TALIESIN: I can't see her at all, can I?

04:30:55.357 --> 04:30:59.439
MATT: Currently, no. She's behind the wall,
pushing you into it.

04:30:59.439 --> 04:31:09.070
TALIESIN: Yep. Huh. Hmm. Yeah, no, I got nothing.

04:31:09.070 --> 04:31:13.241
MATT: All right. At the end of that, the field
pushes in once more.

04:31:13.241 --> 04:31:16.204
TALIESIN: Breaks the wall, probably.

04:31:16.204 --> 04:31:20.293
MATT: Well no, it's pushing against that. It's not
pushing further, sorry, because they're both

04:31:20.293 --> 04:31:24.857
stopped. They're now holding that space. So you
don't take damage again. It doesn't force you. But

04:31:24.857 --> 04:31:27.171
you're still pinned. Keyleth, your turn.

04:31:27.171 --> 04:31:34.846
MARISHA: What is best right now?

04:31:34.846 --> 04:31:41.061
TALIESIN: I want to have a moment.

04:31:41.061 --> 04:31:43.157
MATT: What is best in life?

04:31:43.157 --> 04:31:52.357
MARISHA: Yeah, can I do two slam attacks on him
again? Bam, bam, multi-attack?

04:31:52.357 --> 04:31:56.862
MATT: Pushing him into the wall again? Okay.

04:31:56.862 --> 04:32:02.966
MARISHA: Not good. Same thing for that first one.
Twelve. Oh wait, it's hitting the wall, though?

04:32:02.966 --> 04:32:12.095
MATT: You're essentially just pushing against the
wall. It'll shove, yeah. It's essentially a ten or

04:32:12.095 --> 04:32:13.343
lower.

04:32:13.343 --> 04:32:19.494
MARISHA: Okay, so 15 damage for that first one.

04:32:19.494 --> 04:32:23.988
MATT: No damage on this. You're just pushing the
wall, so the force against him. So make a

04:32:23.988 --> 04:32:25.764
constitution saving throw, Percival.

04:32:25.764 --> 04:32:26.870
TALIESIN: I make one or two?

04:32:26.870 --> 04:32:28.204
MATT: We'll find out. Roll a second attack.

04:32:28.204 --> 04:32:30.921
MARISHA: Natural 19.

04:32:30.921 --> 04:32:36.476
TALIESIN: It's the one thing I'm good at. Oh, not
this time. Ten and 12.

04:32:36.476 --> 04:32:41.612
MATT: Ten and 12. All right. You take, first, 24
points of force damage.

04:32:41.612 --> 04:32:43.196
TALIESIN: 24.

04:32:43.196 --> 04:32:52.228
MATT: 24 points of force damage. Keyleth, I need
you to make a strength check, please. Or a

04:32:52.228 --> 04:32:53.647
strength saving throw.

04:32:53.647 --> 04:32:55.075
MARISHA: Strength saving throw?

04:32:55.075 --> 04:32:56.340
MATT: Correct.

04:32:56.340 --> 04:33:02.941
MARISHA: Natural 17, so 23.

04:33:02.941 --> 04:33:07.777
MATT: So as it pushes back, you manage to keep it
back and then shove him back into it. And then, oh

04:33:07.777 --> 04:33:19.076
my god. That is 25 points of force damage to you,
Percival. And Keyleth, make another strength

04:33:19.076 --> 04:33:23.386
saving throw as the section of wall that you've
pushed in, that's loose and you're shoving him

04:33:23.386 --> 04:33:25.060
with, is being shoved backward.

04:33:25.060 --> 04:33:26.176
MARISHA: Natural 19.

04:33:26.176 --> 04:33:29.372
MATT: You've managed to hold it in place. Still
restrained, you're slowly sandwiching him. Making

04:33:29.372 --> 04:33:33.338
a Percival sandwich. Percy, your turn.

04:33:33.338 --> 04:33:41.029
TALIESIN: Hail Mary. Trying to squeeze out of
this. Nope. That's eight.

04:33:41.029 --> 04:33:45.414
SAM: The ghost of Scanlan floats in front of you.

04:33:45.414 --> 04:33:47.836
MATT: Make another constitution saving throw.

04:33:47.836 --> 04:33:52.670
MARISHA and LIAM: (chanting) First blood! First
blood!

04:33:52.670 --> 04:33:56.176
TALIESIN: I can't count, guys! 25.

04:33:56.176 --> 04:34:02.349
MATT: 25, okay. So you take 13 points of force
damage. Keyleth, your turn.

04:34:02.349 --> 04:34:13.415
MARISHA: Keyleth, my turn? Argh! Squishy squishy!
Squishy Percy! Ooh, no, ten total.

04:34:13.415 --> 04:34:15.725
MATT: Ten total? Just barely.

04:34:15.725 --> 04:34:20.703
MARISHA: And second one, 12 total. Those were bad
rolls.

04:34:20.703 --> 04:34:22.636
MATT: Roll two constitution saving throws,
Percival.

04:34:22.636 --> 04:34:28.606
TALIESIN: This might be the end. I'm at nothing.
18 and 11.

04:34:28.606 --> 04:34:31.325
MATT: First one succeeds. You take 11 points of
force damage.

04:34:31.325 --> 04:34:32.678
TALIESIN: I'm out.

04:34:32.678 --> 04:34:40.910
MATT: Second push, you feel Percival begin to pop
and squish against the outer field. And for the

04:34:40.910 --> 04:34:49.258
purposes of this, one more round of shoving and,
with a (squish), Percival-jelly begins to ooze out

04:34:49.258 --> 04:34:51.592
from behind the wall in which you shove him
against the force.

04:34:51.592 --> 04:34:53.422
TALIESIN: You hear everything I own crack.

04:34:53.422 --> 04:34:57.037
MATT: While you were technically healing 20 points
every round underneath the green beam--

04:34:57.037 --> 04:35:01.351
MARISHA: Oh shit. Wow, yeah.

04:35:01.351 --> 04:35:10.185
MATT: The field dissipates. The rubble begins to
separate and float in space. The ruined corpses of

04:35:10.185 --> 04:35:18.233
all your allies then float aloft around you and
are slowly re-stitched back to life. Grog appears,

04:35:18.233 --> 04:35:24.686
pulled back from the water dimension, from the
depths of the drowning. And you see the bearded

04:35:24.686 --> 04:35:29.803
patron descend from above. As he pats you on the
head and goes--

04:35:29.803 --> 04:35:32.497
MARISHA: I was never religious in-game, but now I
am!

04:35:32.497 --> 04:35:35.472
MATT: "Good job!"

04:35:35.472 --> 04:35:40.216
(laughter)

04:35:40.216 --> 04:35:42.654
MATT: And with that--

04:35:42.654 --> 04:35:45.606
(yelling)

04:35:45.606 --> 04:35:46.998
LIAM: All hail the queen!

04:35:46.998 --> 04:35:53.012
TALIESIN: Without a spell to her name.

04:35:53.012 --> 04:35:55.992
MATT: Level 20 druids, man.

04:35:55.992 --> 04:35:58.426
SAM: In 30 days, she'll know what happened.

04:35:58.426 --> 04:35:59.484
MATT: Yep.

04:35:59.484 --> 04:36:03.064
MARISHA: Yeah, in 20 days I'll be like, what?

04:36:03.064 --> 04:36:05.927
TALIESIN: I had the weirdest dream a month ago!

04:36:05.927 --> 04:36:11.011
MARISHA: I dreamt I killed you, and you, and you.

04:36:11.011 --> 04:36:14.994
MATT: It's funny, I was like, okay, once they
start getting into the high-level spells this is

04:36:14.994 --> 04:36:23.141
really going to turn-- And then Feeblemind. All
right, this is going to be a drag-out brawl to the

04:36:23.141 --> 04:36:24.420
very end.

04:36:24.420 --> 04:36:27.344
TALIESIN: I was really hoping I could burn some
grit back and then do a whole bunch of damage all

04:36:27.344 --> 04:36:28.670
at once.

04:36:28.670 --> 04:36:32.632
MARISHA: But man, you dodged my Feeblemind. That
was hot. That was amazing.

04:36:32.632 --> 04:36:35.499
LIAM: I did what I came here to do.

04:36:35.499 --> 04:36:44.300
TRAVIS: Yeah, I went to the Water Plane with a few
hundred HP left. I was super healthy in the

04:36:44.300 --> 04:36:45.546
water.

04:36:45.546 --> 04:36:47.561
SAM: Like a sensory deprivation tank.

04:36:47.561 --> 04:36:51.365
MATT: That deprives you of all the senses,
eventually.

04:36:51.365 --> 04:36:55.038
MARISHA: I had to get vengeance from fucking it up
last time.

04:36:55.038 --> 04:36:57.167
TRAVIS: So it's cool.

04:36:57.167 --> 04:37:05.412
MATT: Well done, guys. Congratulations, Keyleth.

04:37:05.412 --> 04:37:06.925
MARISHA: I finally won one!

04:37:06.925 --> 04:37:08.119
SAM: Thanks to Marvel Puzzle Quest!

04:37:08.119 --> 04:37:15.378
TALIESIN: Thank you, Marvel Puzzle Quest for
sponsoring our ultimate fighting championship.

04:37:15.378 --> 04:37:20.268
TRAVIS: That is the most messed-up map I've ever
seen.

04:37:20.268 --> 04:37:27.907
TALIESIN: That was mean. I started this game being
the most clutch, powerful motherfucker on the

04:37:27.907 --> 04:37:33.009
planet and ended it like-- Confined spaces fuck
gunslingers.

04:37:33.009 --> 04:37:41.236
MARISHA: I'm the queen. Everyone bow down to me.

04:37:41.236 --> 04:37:51.842
MATT: That's the Feeblemind face. My wife, ladies
and gentlemen. Thank you guys so much for playing.

04:37:51.842 --> 04:37:58.738
Thank you guys so much for sticking with us, if
you're still here. We'll be back next week to

04:37:58.738 --> 04:38:04.918
discuss-- Some of you will be here for Talks
Machina, I believe, and next Thursday to do the

04:38:04.918 --> 04:38:13.443
Q&amp;amp;A. After that, have a wonderful holidays and New
Year. And is it Thursday yet? Good night, guys.

04:38:13.443 --> 04:44:59.990
