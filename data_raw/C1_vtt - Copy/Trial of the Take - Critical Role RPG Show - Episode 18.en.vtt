00:00:00.468 --> 00:00:05.316
MATT: Welcome, and hello everyone to the next
episode of Critical Role. A silly show where a

00:00:05.375 --> 00:00:09.657
bunch of us voice actors get together and play
Dungeons and Dragons on Geek and Sundry's twitch

00:00:09.657 --> 00:00:14.726
stream. So for returning fans, welcome, and to all
the new folks tuning in finally, welcome to you as

00:00:14.726 --> 00:00:21.427
well. So before we get into the meat, a few
announcements and such, let's roll that intro.

00:00:21.427 --> 00:00:22.699
TRAVIS: Silly?

00:00:22.699 --> 00:01:29.559
[dramatic music]

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:34.638
MATT: And welcome back. So, a couple things I want
to get off the bat to you guys. Our subscription

00:01:34.638 --> 00:01:40.139
giveaways this evening. For every hundred
subscribers, we are giving away special care

00:01:40.194 --> 00:01:45.140
packages with D&amp;amp;D books signed by the Critical
Role crew, as well as a signed photo, comics,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.126
other goodies. So the next one will be at 5,300,
we will do another giveaway. Remember, you have to

00:01:50.126 --> 00:01:58.374
be in the chat room to be able to acquire one of
these packages. So tune in to get something. Keep

00:01:58.374 --> 00:01:59.483
that in mind.

00:01:59.483 --> 00:02:00.650
LAURA: Yeah.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.906
MATT: Also, for those who may not remember from
last week, we are in a very interesting month of

00:02:05.906 --> 00:02:11.252
Critical Role, as the party has been split due to
a circumstance where, in the city of Vasselheim,

00:02:11.252 --> 00:02:16.195
the party, chasing after a hydra that seemed to be
harrying the outside walls of the city and

00:02:16.195 --> 00:02:22.631
slaying it, got in the way and accidentally broke
the laws of the Vasselheim by hunting and slaying

00:02:22.782 --> 00:02:29.005
when they weren't approved to do so. Being called
skags by a band of hunters that works for the

00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:34.062
Slayer's Take guildhall. A guild that pretty much
regulates most hunting of monsters and creatures

00:02:34.062 --> 00:02:41.449
within the vicinity of Vasselheim. So, as opposed
to going up and dealing with charges at the seat

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:46.398
of justice, they instead were given the option by
the head of the guild hall to possibly join, but in

00:02:46.398 --> 00:02:52.581
order to do so, they would have to fulfill a
contract and prove themselves worthy of being a

00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:58.871
member of the guild. And the guild master, our
fantastic Huntmaster Vanessa Cyndrial, hand-picked

00:02:58.871 --> 00:03:05.644
two different groups, splitting up the twins, and
they have all set out to return the next day to

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:13.268
join, and figure out what their contract will be.
So, this week we have playing: we have Grog. We

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.697
have Vex'ahlia. We have Percy. We have the 
shortly arriving here Scanlan,

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:20.383
who has been fighting L.A. traffic.

00:03:20.383 --> 00:03:21.373
TRAVIS: He's here!

00:03:21.373 --> 00:03:22.488
(cheering)

00:03:22.488 --> 00:03:24.483
MATT: Quite literally shortly arriving, Scanlan.

00:03:24.483 --> 00:03:26.681
TRAVIS: Like Superman, that was amazing.

00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:37.540
MATT: And eventually to join the party as they
slowly make their way there-- mysterious head

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:44.056
kiss. This is the best Thursday ever. We have
joining us eventually at some point we have the

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:49.446
very wonderful and talented Mary Elizabeth
McGlynn. A fantastic, talented voice actress and

00:03:49.446 --> 00:03:50.898
director and amazing person.

00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:53.178
MARY: Hello, sorry.

00:03:53.178 --> 00:03:58.756
MATT: So look her stuff up online. She is also a
great musician, singer, and this is her first time

00:03:58.807 --> 00:04:00.392
playing Dungeons and Dragons.

00:04:00.392 --> 00:04:01.572
TRAVIS: Newbie!

00:04:01.572 --> 00:04:02.828
MARY: Newbie!

00:04:02.828 --> 00:04:04.350
MATT: Yeah, I'm super excited.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.626
TRAVIS: I'm going to kill you.

00:04:05.626 --> 00:04:06.453
MARY: Yes.

00:04:06.453 --> 00:04:12.401
MATT: Probably. And in the middle of the other
table, we have our other illustrious guest this

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:17.439
evening. The so-called headmaster of Geek and
Sundry herself, Felicia Day.

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:18.952
Thank you for joining us, Felicia.

00:04:18.952 --> 00:04:19.897
(cheering)

00:04:19.897 --> 00:04:21.818
FELICIA: I like to refer to myself as Duchess,
Grand Duchess.

00:04:21.818 --> 00:04:23.145
MATT: Grand Duchess, also viable.

00:04:23.145 --> 00:04:24.949
SAM: Golf claps.

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.668
FELICIA: Golf claps, very appropriate.

00:04:26.668 --> 00:04:30.293
MATT: (laughs) So yeah, thank you so much for
joining.

00:04:30.293 --> 00:04:33.910
FELICIA: I'm so excited to be here. I'm a huge fan
of the show, so I spend my

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.676
Thursdays watching you guys.

00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:37.523
SAM: Who is your favorite character on the show?

00:04:37.523 --> 00:04:39.236
LAURA: Say Trinket, say Trinket

00:04:39.236 --> 00:04:42.098
FELICIA: Not the one with the scatological
problem.

00:04:42.098 --> 00:04:43.957
SAM: I think of it more as a gift.

00:04:43.957 --> 00:04:46.337
(laughter)

00:04:46.395 --> 00:04:48.609
TALIESIN: That keeps giving and giving and...

00:04:48.609 --> 00:04:50.895
MARY: The one who likes to talk to poo.

00:04:50.895 --> 00:04:53.847
TRAVIS: Well that's a lot of us, actually.

00:04:53.847 --> 00:05:00.498
MATT: Before we get into the nitty gritty, do we
have any announcements we want to make? Anything

00:05:00.498 --> 00:05:03.548
in particular coming up? I believe, Laura, you're
bolting at the end of the game.

00:05:03.548 --> 00:05:08.057
LAURA: I'm leaving probably during the game, to
catch my flight to go to GenCon for the

00:05:08.057 --> 00:05:10.154
Titansgrave panel. Tomorrow!

00:05:10.154 --> 00:05:14.988
MATT: Yeah! Which for the record, I want to point
out guys, this is how much Laura loves you. She

00:05:14.988 --> 00:05:19.377
was going to miss today's game but then bit the
bullet, changed her flight, just so she could be

00:05:19.377 --> 00:05:20.606
here to play with everyone.

00:05:20.606 --> 00:05:24.053
FELICIA: Golf claps.

00:05:24.102 --> 00:05:28.854
LAURA: Well, after I saw my glorious Trinket
yesterday, there was no choice really.

00:05:28.854 --> 00:05:33.718
MATT: (laughs) The Trinket that devours, by the
way. Every person that's hugged that bear has

00:05:33.718 --> 00:05:39.437
vanished, temporarily, within its physical form.
It is a new wonderful addition to the chat room--

00:05:39.482 --> 00:05:44.355
I mean to the whole show, and thank you to the
Critters for making that happen. It's ridiculous.

00:05:44.408 --> 00:05:50.059
It's-- you guys are the best, I have no words.
Anything else anyone wants to announce?

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:51.314
Anything coming up?

00:05:51.314 --> 00:05:57.067
MARY: I'm off to San Antonio tomorrow morning,
very early, for San Japan. With Steve Blum. So

00:05:57.067 --> 00:06:00.077
come on out and have some fun in San Antonio.

00:06:00.077 --> 00:06:03.750
MATT: Heck yeah. It's a great convention, I went
there last year. They're really, really good, so

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.768
all you folks out there.

00:06:04.768 --> 00:06:06.024
MARY: We were both there last year.

00:06:06.024 --> 00:06:06.994
MATT: That's right, we were.

00:06:06.994 --> 00:06:07.987
MARY: Yes!

00:06:07.987 --> 00:06:13.972
MATT: So go check out Mary in San Antonio. You
guys should go. Also, we've had a lot of questions

00:06:13.972 --> 00:06:17.980
through twitter, from a lot of the fans, and I
like the idea of transparency, and mentioning how

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:24.667
first off, no game or game master is infallible
and rules do shift and change and there have been

00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:29.701
a couple of minor alterations to the rules. Which,
you know, you house rule things in a game and you

00:06:29.701 --> 00:06:33.695
test it out and balance can shift. For those who
have looked at the gunslinger martial archetype

00:06:33.695 --> 00:06:36.793
that Percy plays with, I have made a few
adjustments to it, balancing out a few elements

00:06:36.793 --> 00:06:40.548
there. DCs for different shots and--

00:06:40.548 --> 00:06:43.921
TALIESIN: Definitely some foam darts that I'm
shooting now. That's all I'm saying. I'm saying

00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:46.649
there is a lot of pump action and then a foam dart
comes out.

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:48.533
TRAVIS: Really?

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:50.244
TALIESIN: With a suction thing at the end.

00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:56.545
MATT: You don't get foam darts until level 18.
That is a higher level ability. The noise happens

00:06:56.545 --> 00:07:01.905
at level 19-- you level up to get the actual
sound. So check out the gunslinger archetype,

00:07:01.905 --> 00:07:07.677
there's been some changes to it. Also, for the
sorcerer points, we had house ruled a

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:12.902
configuration where sorcerer points would be one
point per spell level of spell cast. As the levels

00:07:12.902 --> 00:07:16.604
got higher it got a little overpowered in some
combat circumstances, so we narrowed that down.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:22.353
Which is still a bonus over the actual rules which
allow you to only cast one spell per round and a

00:07:22.353 --> 00:07:27.663
cantrip. We made it so that you can cast, with
quickened spell, any spell and then a 2nd-level

00:07:27.663 --> 00:07:31.133
spell maximum in the same round. Slight
variation.

00:07:31.133 --> 00:07:32.596
LAURA: I don't understand anything you just said.

00:07:32.596 --> 00:07:33.774
TALIESIN: Made no sense to me.

00:07:33.774 --> 00:07:35.072
MARY: Two spells at once? Two spells.

00:07:35.072 --> 00:07:39.258
MATT: That's okay. It's for the sorcerer, you
don't have to worry about it. Minor house rule

00:07:39.258 --> 00:07:45.921
adjustments, so all you guys out there who GM and
DM don't be afraid to adjust balance as you go, as

00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:51.397
long as you talk to the players about it. Anyway,
that's it and that's all on my end. Shall we

00:07:51.397 --> 00:07:52.774
go ahead and begin?

00:07:52.774 --> 00:07:54.763
TRAVIS: (loud maniacal laughter)

00:07:54.763 --> 00:07:56.001
MATT: Calm down, Phillip.

00:07:56.001 --> 00:07:59.437
TRAVIS: All right, but I'm not Phillip right now,
he lost. I'm a winner.

00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:01.959
LAURA: Phillip doesn't exist anymore.

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:03.541
TRAVIS: (cries)

00:08:03.541 --> 00:08:06.003
LAURA: Phillip's legacy is 1,000 gold to repay.

00:08:06.158 --> 00:08:10.760
TRAVIS: Phillip is training to an 80s training
montage right now. In a beef locker somewhere.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.421
MARY: Because everyone needs a montage.

00:08:12.421 --> 00:08:13.605
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:08:13.605 --> 00:08:18.312
MATT: Glorious. I think that is an important
circumstance. All right, so getting this started.

00:08:18.312 --> 00:08:25.013
The party has found themselves in the city of
Vasselheim; a very deity and religion based city,

00:08:25.013 --> 00:08:30.068
in a very harsh environment. It's far up
north in this continent and the weather itself is

00:08:30.127 --> 00:08:36.064
very cold, the landscape is very harsh and rugged,
and outside of the city itself, there is an

00:08:36.064 --> 00:08:42.620
extremely dark, oppressive, almost unnaturally
fast-growing forest known as the Vesper

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:48.093
Timberland. This is where you encountered the
hydra, last time. You just barely trekked out of the

00:08:48.093 --> 00:08:53.683
the city and found that creature. Who knows what
else lies out there, but the city seems very well

00:08:53.731 --> 00:08:57.118
prepared to defend itself against whatever
atrocities make their way towards the outskirts of

00:08:57.118 --> 00:09:08.577
the city. So, after Grog fought very gloriously in
the Crucible and just barely lost due to a test of

00:09:08.623 --> 00:09:15.173
strength that just didn't fall in his favor, he
sulked via ale and ladies back at the tavern.

00:09:15.173 --> 00:09:16.525
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:09:16.525 --> 00:09:24.289
MATT: Now, after defeating the hydra, being called
on their law breakage in Vasselheim, have been

00:09:24.289 --> 00:09:29.256
tasked to return the next morning, as separate
groups, to figure out what contract is being given

00:09:29.256 --> 00:09:35.880
to them and what members of their team await them
as they arrive. So, you guys have taken the

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.228
evening to rest. The next morning has come about.
You find yourselves awakening within your

00:09:39.228 --> 00:09:46.476
respective tavern rooms, the members of Vox
Machina. What preparation would you like to embark

00:09:46.476 --> 00:09:50.818
in this morning for whatever mysterious trek
awaits you?

00:09:50.818 --> 00:09:53.946
TRAVIS: Do they have a weapons closet?

00:09:53.946 --> 00:09:56.147
LAURA: In the tavern room?

00:09:56.147 --> 00:09:58.644
TRAVIS: Oh shit, I thought we were in the
guildhall.

00:09:58.644 --> 00:10:01.723
MATT: Not yet. You can go there if you want to,
but if there is anything you want to do before

00:10:01.723 --> 00:10:04.577
arriving at the guildhall, that's up to you.

00:10:04.577 --> 00:10:06.246
TRAVIS: Scanlan.

00:10:06.246 --> 00:10:07.331
SAM: Oi!

00:10:07.331 --> 00:10:09.919
TRAVIS: Do you want anything from the tavern
before we leave?

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:11.021
SAM: What time is it?

00:10:11.021 --> 00:10:12.505
TRAVIS: What time is it?

00:10:12.505 --> 00:10:15.865
LAURA: What difference does it make? I want to
take a shot with my brother.

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:24.733
MATT: All right. So as you and Vax'ildan get
together at the bar, you have the strongest form

00:10:24.733 --> 00:10:30.968
of nasty Vasselheim liquor that they could
possibly muster. It looks somewhat murky, it has

00:10:30.968 --> 00:10:37.531
elements of blue and gray to it. The barkeep
assured you that this is-- "This is what you're

00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:40.730
"looking for to wake up in the morning, trust me."

00:10:40.791 --> 00:10:43.035
LAURA: Does it taste like NyQuil?

00:10:43.035 --> 00:10:48.770
MATT: As you down the shot, it's-- not knowing
what NyQuil tastes like because there is no such

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:50.366
thing as NyQuil in this world.

00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:51.300
LAURA: Right.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.634
TALIESIN: Ye olde NyQuil.

00:10:52.634 --> 00:10:57.420
MATT: The flavor would be reminiscent of licking a
wagon wheel that has seen

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.484
at least 100 miles of travel.

00:11:00.484 --> 00:11:04.924
LAURA: Tastes like your feet smell, brother.

00:11:04.924 --> 00:11:12.492
MATT: Of which, Vax immediately cringes his face.
"Oh well, that is rather uncouth, dear sister"

00:11:12.492 --> 00:11:16.064
TALIESIN: And not having Liam here, I'll just--
like that.

00:11:16.064 --> 00:11:18.118
TRAVIS: Get rid of it. Put it down.

00:11:18.118 --> 00:11:24.197
MATT: The foot's healed now. The foot is healed.
So you finish your shots,

00:11:24.197 --> 00:11:26.614
you say adieu to each other and--

00:11:26.614 --> 00:11:28.720
LAURA: See you on the other side

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.651
MATT: "Indeed, stay safe."

00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:33.435
TRAVIS: Bye Vax! (laughs)

00:11:33.435 --> 00:11:40.439
MATT: "Bye Grog." And he gives you a silent finger
as he leaves the tavern, in true Vax fashion.

00:11:40.439 --> 00:11:44.251
TRAVIS: He always mixes those fingers up.

00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:46.356
MATT: Any preparation on your guys' end?

00:11:46.356 --> 00:11:50.839
SAM: I'm going to load up my-- whatever this thing
is.

00:11:50.839 --> 00:11:52.103
MATT: Your Ioun Stone?

00:11:52.103 --> 00:11:57.251
SAM: Is that what I have? That's the thing here.
I'm going to load that up with an Invisibility

00:11:57.251 --> 00:11:59.015
spell. Is that a thing I could do?

00:11:59.015 --> 00:12:01.181
MATT: Yeah, you can put up to three spell levels
into that.

00:12:01.181 --> 00:12:03.310
SAM: That's two in there, right?

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.194
MATT: You may have even been able to do before
you slept the night before, so then you would

00:12:06.194 --> 00:12:09.798
have all your spells back. So we'll say you did that. 
So you have an extra Invisibility

00:12:09.798 --> 00:12:11.470
spell in your Ioun Stone.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.617
SAM: And I can store three spells in there,
right?

00:12:13.617 --> 00:12:14.923
MATT: Three spell levels.

00:12:14.923 --> 00:12:17.129
SAM: Three spell level-- So only one spell at a
time?

00:12:17.129 --> 00:12:19.176
MATT: Or you can do three 1st-level spells.

00:12:19.176 --> 00:12:23.078
SAM: Oh! Then never mind. I thought it was three
different spells. I've already got an extra

00:12:23.078 --> 00:12:25.380
Lightning Bolt in there. I won't add to it, never
mind.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:29.037
MATT: Then yeah, that is a full Ioun Stone. That
thing is pulsing with energy and going,

00:12:29.037 --> 00:12:30.081
"I'm good."

00:12:30.081 --> 00:12:32.129
SAM: I'm good, didn't understand.

00:12:32.129 --> 00:12:33.694
MATT: Fair enough. Percy.

00:12:33.694 --> 00:12:38.233
TALIESIN: Other than just tinkering on a few plans
that I have rolling around. I don't really have

00:12:38.233 --> 00:12:41.770
the equipment to build anything particularly
interesting before we head out.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:45.795
SAM: Grog might have something in the bag of
holding that you could use.

00:12:45.795 --> 00:12:51.945
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! I've got lots of shit. We have a
salt lick rock, we've got three firewood bundles,

00:12:51.945 --> 00:12:53.545
dried food rations...

00:12:53.545 --> 00:12:55.049
SAM: How many fancy cloaks left?

00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:56.756
TRAVIS: There's... two.

00:12:56.756 --> 00:12:58.632
SAM: Well, that's something.

00:12:58.632 --> 00:13:02.333
TALIESIN: And we've got that leather from that
weird bat creature from the Underdark.

00:13:02.333 --> 00:13:04.649
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm sure it doesn't smell bad.

00:13:04.649 --> 00:13:05.898
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

00:13:05.898 --> 00:13:09.480
TALIESIN: Is there any metal canisters in there,
of any kind?

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:14.330
TRAVIS: I mean, I've got my hooded lantern, but
you can't have that. It's dark in places.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:15.489
TALIESIN: No, I don't want that.

00:13:15.489 --> 00:13:18.790
LAURA: I bet Tiberius has metal canisters, he's
got so many canisters.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.935
TRAVIS: Two pieces of armor. Just armor

00:13:20.935 --> 00:13:28.952
TALIESIN: I may take a piece of armor and see if I
can put together some sort of frag grenade thing.

00:13:28.952 --> 00:13:30.078
SAM: A what?

00:13:30.078 --> 00:13:31.592
TALIESIN: I just want to make a--

00:13:31.592 --> 00:13:32.834
SAM: Is that a thing?

00:13:32.834 --> 00:13:33.852
TALIESIN: You don't know me.

00:13:33.852 --> 00:13:35.825
(laughter)

00:13:35.825 --> 00:13:41.436
TALIESIN: Just make a canister, put some black
powder in there, put the thing together. It

00:13:41.436 --> 00:13:45.507
doesn't even have a fuse, it's something I can
toss and shoot to trigger.

00:13:45.507 --> 00:13:46.900
TRAVIS: Ooh.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:52.227
MATT: Interesting. I will say, due to time
constraints, you would probably have to skip a

00:13:52.272 --> 00:13:56.058
decent breakfast to do this. So, be aware you
may be hungry later on.

00:13:56.058 --> 00:13:57.726
LAURA: I've got food.

00:13:57.917 --> 00:13:58.960
TALIESIN: Done

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.841
TRAVIS: We've got dried food rations in the bag.

00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:02.428
TALIESIN: I'll have a granola bar.

00:14:02.428 --> 00:14:05.574
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

00:14:05.574 --> 00:14:08.465
TRAVIS: Roll good, you're starting us off. Roll
good.

00:14:08.465 --> 00:14:10.053
SAM: I'm going to try to inspire him.

00:14:10.053 --> 00:14:11.042
TRAVIS: Roll good.

00:14:11.042 --> 00:14:13.478
TALIESIN: You're going to inspire me?

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:17.312
SAM: I'm going to inspire him with a little,
(sings) Boom, clap, the sound of your gun, the

00:14:17.312 --> 00:14:22.222
beat goes on and on and on and on. Boom, clap--
That's all I got

00:14:22.222 --> 00:14:31.081
MATT: You can take your d10 bardic inspiration, as
his song blares into your left ear as you search

00:14:31.081 --> 00:14:35.632
the town for a decent location to possibly
construct this.

00:14:35.632 --> 00:14:36.801
TALIESIN: 19.

00:14:36.801 --> 00:14:37.763
MATT: Total of 19?

00:14:37.763 --> 00:14:38.828
TALIESIN: Total of 19.

00:14:38.828 --> 00:14:43.291
MATT: All right. Asking around and speaking to a
few folks around Vasselheim, you eventually find a

00:14:43.291 --> 00:14:49.489
few folks that point you toward this long
abandoned workshop that's been burned down, and it

00:14:49.489 --> 00:14:53.832
hasn't really been touched. As you go to it, you
have to push some of the burned wood out of the

00:14:53.832 --> 00:15:01.214
way, but there is indeed a currently functional,
if for a long time unused, forge and anvil

00:15:01.214 --> 00:15:10.810
available. In poor condition, but
functional. Given about two, two and a half hours,

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.916
you might be pushing your arrival time at the
guildhall, but you could probably do it. Do you

00:15:14.916 --> 00:15:16.220
want to go ahead and give it a shot?

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.568
TALIESIN: I'm going to give it a shot.

00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:21.111
MATT: All right. Do you want to use another one of
your bardic inspirations on this?

00:15:21.111 --> 00:15:22.290
SAM: Can I do that?

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.156
MATT: You can use it up to-- I think it's like
five or six times.

00:15:24.156 --> 00:15:25.345
SAM: He's fine.

00:15:25.345 --> 00:15:27.578
(laughter)

00:15:27.578 --> 00:15:28.908
TRAVIS: Stingy motherfucker!

00:15:28.908 --> 00:15:30.362
SAM: At this point I'm probably drunk.

00:15:30.362 --> 00:15:34.698
TALIESIN: I don't get a montage then, never mind.
It's all right, save it for later. We're

00:15:34.698 --> 00:15:36.953
going to need it for later.

00:15:36.953 --> 00:15:43.115
MATT: So it takes you a while to rummage through
the ground to get everything set up. You have the

00:15:43.165 --> 00:15:47.906
tools from your tinker's kit that you usually keep
with you anyway, and you begin hammering away at

00:15:47.966 --> 00:15:52.996
the metal, preparing yourself a nice little
spherical container. Using your black powder,

00:15:52.996 --> 00:15:55.812
which you're starting to get a little low on
black powder between your bullets you've been

00:15:55.881 --> 00:15:57.294
constructing and other stuff.

00:15:57.294 --> 00:15:58.896
TALIESIN: Got to get home, I know.

00:15:58.896 --> 00:16:02.457
MATT: So something you can either, some point in
the future try to scavenge up the materials for or

00:16:02.518 --> 00:16:07.594
make yourself. But just letting you know, you're
starting to run a little low. So go ahead and make

00:16:07.594 --> 00:16:15.147
a-- I'm going to say make a tinkering check with
your proficiency bonus of four and we will say

00:16:15.147 --> 00:16:18.951
with your dexterity. Since this is very
meticulous, to make sure this doesn't detonate

00:16:18.951 --> 00:16:21.422
during construction.

00:16:21.422 --> 00:16:25.057
SAM: Wow, you could really use some
inspiration right now.

00:16:25.107 --> 00:16:27.998
TALIESIN: No, I don't. That is a 29.

00:16:27.998 --> 00:16:30.251
SAM: Stingy works.

00:16:30.301 --> 00:16:31.600
TRAVIS: Like two-nine?

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.489
TALIESIN: Like two-nine. Not two nines, but
two-nine.

00:16:34.489 --> 00:16:35.509
MATT: What did you roll?

00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:36.639
TALIESIN: I rolled 19.

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:37.757
MATT: Yeah. That'll do it.

00:16:37.757 --> 00:16:40.248
(laughter)

00:16:40.248 --> 00:16:45.352
MATT: All right, so, in spite of the terrible
materials at your disposal-- As far as the forge

00:16:45.352 --> 00:16:49.950
itself, you barely get it lit, but you can manage
to heat it at enough, at least, to ply a soft

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:55.050
metal. There is an aluminum base type that you
construct as the container, and then coat that

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:59.728
with chunks of very, very hard steel that you
think will work as shrapnel. You manage to

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:06.038
complete it. You're not sure how effective it will
be, but at least you know it will travel safe, and

00:17:06.038 --> 00:17:11.188
that is really more important than anything else
with these type of makeshift explosives.

00:17:11.371 --> 00:17:13.156
TALIESIN: I made a holy hand grenade.

00:17:13.156 --> 00:17:15.235
(laughter)

00:17:15.235 --> 00:17:16.587
TRAVIS: Awesome.

00:17:16.638 --> 00:17:22.371
MATT: Indeed. All right, as the rest of you gather
up, you've had your breakfast, you rested, you

00:17:22.371 --> 00:17:28.882
make your way towards the Slayer's Take guildhall.
Approaching the front steps again, the wooden

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:34.760
engraving on the front doors, you step into the
main foyer area and are greeted again by Mertin,

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.817
the gruff looking halfling, who is in the process of
thumbing through some books. He has some dried

00:17:39.876 --> 00:17:42.292
fruit on the side of his chin. He's a little
groggy, like he

00:17:42.292 --> 00:17:43.469
didn't sleep well the night before.

00:17:43.469 --> 00:17:44.935
TRAVIS: He's a little what?

00:17:44.935 --> 00:17:46.688
MATT: He's a little groggy.

00:17:46.688 --> 00:17:48.773
TRAVIS: Lucky chap.

00:17:48.773 --> 00:17:56.350
MATT: He looks up as you guys approach. "Very nice
you all could finally make it, it appears you are

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.112
"only a grand total of 25 minutes late."

00:17:59.112 --> 00:18:00.266
LAURA: 25?!

00:18:00.266 --> 00:18:01.699
MATT: "It's not too much of a problem."

00:18:01.699 --> 00:18:03.849
SAM: What's a minute?

00:18:03.849 --> 00:18:07.671
MATT: "It's... All right, there is not too much
going on at the moment. I will not mention this to

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:13.110
"the wife. I mean the Huntmaster. Don't mention to
her that I referred to her as my wife."

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:19.570
TRAVIS: Kord's strength to you, sir, you've got a
little bit right here.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.322
LAURA: Oh, that's lovely.

00:18:21.322 --> 00:18:22.668
MATT: "I appreciate the heads up."

00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:23.899
TRAVIS: Not a problem, not a problem.

00:18:23.899 --> 00:18:31.721
MATT: "I hate to lose papaya. So. Let's see, we
have the four of you here. This is the required

00:18:31.721 --> 00:18:36.339
"necessary group for the first travel this morning,
I am excited to see what the mistress has

00:18:36.339 --> 00:18:42.634
"available for you. First, and foremost, let me
introduce to you one of your traveling companions

00:18:42.634 --> 00:18:47.719
"for this. Another hopeful for the Slayer's Take.
Let me retrieve her."

00:18:47.719 --> 00:18:52.459
And you see Mertin walks off to one of the back
rooms, opens the door and whispers out, "Hey

00:18:52.520 --> 00:19:00.316
"quick, your team is here." Opens the door, and
walking out-- if you want to describe yourself.

00:19:00.316 --> 00:19:02.653
MARY: I walk out in a black cloak.

00:19:02.653 --> 00:19:04.446
SAM: This is exciting.

00:19:04.446 --> 00:19:11.541
MARY: My hair is white, and I have silver eyes,
and a long staff with four dragons and a moonstone

00:19:11.541 --> 00:19:21.463
planet, as it were, in their midst. I walk out
slowly and I look them all over, one by one.

00:19:21.564 --> 00:19:32.393
Saying, I don't know you, I don't know you-- as my
tail whips back and forth. I don't know you--

00:19:32.393 --> 00:19:39.633
almost hitting you with my horns. You, I know. I
saw you at the Crucible, didn't I?

00:19:39.633 --> 00:19:41.899
TRAVIS: Maybe.

00:19:41.899 --> 00:19:45.246
MARY: Well done against the Hammer.

00:19:45.246 --> 00:19:51.537
TRAVIS: Thank you, I often get confused with
Phillip the Terrible.

00:19:51.537 --> 00:19:58.223
MARY: Yes, I'll bet you do. You don't look that
terrible to me, though.

00:19:58.223 --> 00:20:04.105
TRAVIS: Grog begins to blush, a large blue color
on his cheeks.

00:20:04.105 --> 00:20:06.300
LAURA: What's your name, woman?

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.327
MARY: Zahra.

00:20:07.327 --> 00:20:07.986
SAM: What?

00:20:07.986 --> 00:20:09.931
MARY: Zahra. Zahra Hydris.

00:20:09.978 --> 00:20:11.565
LAURA: Lovely.

00:20:11.565 --> 00:20:15.437
MARY: And what's yours?

00:20:15.437 --> 00:20:16.467
SAM: Me?

00:20:16.467 --> 00:20:17.419
MARY: Yes.

00:20:17.419 --> 00:20:20.696
SAM: Well, I'm known by different names in
different places.

00:20:20.696 --> 00:20:21.881
TRAVIS: Ain't that the truth.

00:20:21.881 --> 00:20:23.313
MARY: Really?

00:20:23.313 --> 00:20:24.947
SAM: Some call me Kingslayer.

00:20:25.008 --> 00:20:26.977
(laughter)

00:20:26.977 --> 00:20:32.943
SAM: Some call me Scanlan. Some just call me when
they want a good time.

00:20:32.943 --> 00:20:35.690
(laughter)

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:38.388
TALIESIN: Mostly we just call him Scanlan.

00:20:38.388 --> 00:20:41.993
MARY: I'll keep the good time in mind. And you?

00:20:41.993 --> 00:20:45.890
TALIESIN: Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel
Klossowski de Rolo III.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.275
TRAVIS: You can call him Percy.

00:20:47.275 --> 00:20:49.273
TALIESIN: They just call me Percy.

00:20:49.273 --> 00:20:50.610
MARY: I see you have many weapons on you.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:51.728
TALIESIN: Yes, I dabble

00:20:51.728 --> 00:20:52.741
MARY: You dabble a bit?

00:20:52.741 --> 00:20:53.737
TALIESIN: I do dabble.

00:20:53.737 --> 00:20:55.588
MARY: Yes. Any forging?

00:20:55.588 --> 00:21:00.431
TALIESIN: Yes, actually. I just picked it up
recently. I've been working on things. I pull out

00:21:00.431 --> 00:21:01.845
the holy hand grenade.

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:02.890
MARY: Ah.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.092
TALIESIN: Getting better.

00:21:04.092 --> 00:21:05.779
MARY: I saw one of those in Antioch once

00:21:05.779 --> 00:21:10.708
TALIESIN: It's where I've seen them written of.
It's something new.

00:21:10.708 --> 00:21:12.847
MARY: We'll have to compare notes sometime.

00:21:12.847 --> 00:21:14.301
TALIESIN: Absolutely, charmed.

00:21:14.456 --> 00:21:17.255
MARY: I'd love to see your technique.

00:21:17.255 --> 00:21:24.371
MATT: There is something mildly off-putting by her
intense red skin, her relatively pointed incisors

00:21:24.371 --> 00:21:31.437
and the very prominent tiefling demonic blood in
her body.

00:21:31.437 --> 00:21:33.270
TRAVIS: You're a tiefling?!

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:41.737
MATT: Nevertheless, there is an elegance to the
way she walks, and there is this look of silent

00:21:41.737 --> 00:21:45.204
judgment as she continuously passes her eyes over
the rest of the group.

00:21:45.353 --> 00:21:47.013
LAURA: Did you want to know my name?

00:21:47.013 --> 00:21:51.943
MARY: Yes I would. Now I'm not so sure, but
please. Humor me

00:21:51.943 --> 00:21:54.649
LAURA: Vex'ahlia. It's a pleasure

00:21:54.649 --> 00:21:56.367
MARY: The pleasure is all mine.

00:21:56.367 --> 00:21:57.651
LAURA: Yes.

00:21:57.651 --> 00:22:00.461
TRAVIS: Oh that's an icy hand grip, isn't it.

00:22:00.461 --> 00:22:03.640
LAURA: I love being out here without my brother. I
just love it.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.151
MARY: You have a brother?

00:22:05.151 --> 00:22:07.300
LAURA: I do.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.221
MARY: Oh. How fascinating.

00:22:10.221 --> 00:22:14.308
TRAVIS: I am Grog, the unintimidated.

00:22:14.308 --> 00:22:18.457
MARY: It's nice to know your true name Phillip-- I
mean Grog.

00:22:18.514 --> 00:22:21.612
TRAVIS: (whispered) I think she knows.

00:22:21.612 --> 00:22:24.040
TALIESIN: I would like to run a quick perception
test.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.475
MATT: What are you trying to do?

00:22:25.475 --> 00:22:29.860
TALIESIN: I'm trying to figure out if she's
titled. She certainly strikes me as titled. I

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.895
think she has blood. She may not have blue blood
but--

00:22:33.895 --> 00:22:35.156
LAURA: (whispers) She's got blood.

00:22:35.156 --> 00:22:36.410
MATT: This would be more of an insight check.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:37.705
TALIESIN: Insight check, all right.

00:22:37.705 --> 00:22:39.829
TRAVIS: (whispers) She's a tiefling!

00:22:39.829 --> 00:22:41.183
TALIESIN: Ten.

00:22:41.183 --> 00:22:51.163
MATT: Best you can tell. From her posture, the way
she walks, there is definitely a, for lack of a

00:22:51.163 --> 00:22:58.605
better term, a non-arrogant self importance to how
she holds herself. But there is something about it

00:22:58.605 --> 00:23:04.632
that... there is a mild hint of insecurity there.

00:23:04.632 --> 00:23:06.484
TALIESIN: Interesting. All right.

00:23:06.484 --> 00:23:09.917
TRAVIS: Could I ask you what your weapon of choice
is?

00:23:09.917 --> 00:23:12.087
MARY: That would be my staff.

00:23:12.087 --> 00:23:15.425
TRAVIS: Oh, right, yeah.

00:23:15.425 --> 00:23:17.384
MARY: It took many years to forge it.

00:23:17.384 --> 00:23:18.844
LAURA: You made it yourself?

00:23:18.844 --> 00:23:20.216
MARY: I did.

00:23:20.216 --> 00:23:21.826
LAURA: Damn, that's impressive.

00:23:21.826 --> 00:23:23.102
MARY: Thank you.

00:23:23.102 --> 00:23:26.182
MATT: At this point Mertin is looking angrily at a
small pocket watch that he pulls out and looks at.

00:23:26.182 --> 00:23:32.582
"This is very unusual. Let me see who is supposed
to be leading your group. Hold on just a moment."

00:23:32.582 --> 00:23:34.325
And he gets up and exits the room briefly.

00:23:34.325 --> 00:23:35.587
LAURA: Leading?

00:23:35.587 --> 00:23:40.797
MATT: He comes back after about two minutes with a
small handbook and reads through. "Yes, well, it is

00:23:40.797 --> 00:23:45.841
"customary that as a part of these trials, there is
a member of the Slayers Take is to accompany you

00:23:45.841 --> 00:23:47.278
"on this journey to make sure that you--"

00:23:47.278 --> 00:23:49.427
SAM: I volunteer to be leader of the group.

00:23:49.427 --> 00:23:51.746
MATT: "That is not up for discussion. I am sorry,
small man."

00:23:51.746 --> 00:23:54.479
(laughter)

00:23:54.479 --> 00:23:56.682
SAM: I magically make a cup appear.

00:23:56.682 --> 00:24:04.306
MATT: He looks slightly impressed, but only
slightly. By the way, being called 'small man' by a

00:24:04.306 --> 00:24:12.769
halfling is a feat within itself. "All right, so,
the assigned leader to be your guide slayer for

00:24:12.918 --> 00:24:22.922
"this venture... Oh... really. Well, this should be
curious indeed. She's late, it seems." At which

00:24:22.954 --> 00:24:29.905
point, the door opens to the guild hall and in
comes stumbling a human female.

00:24:29.905 --> 00:24:35.773
FELICIA: And I run and I-- Oh my gosh I'm so sorry
I'm late, I'm so sorry-- and then I trip,

00:24:35.773 --> 00:24:45.239
ridiculously, and I spill cut papaya everywhere.
Oh my gosh, that is disappointing. That is just

00:24:45.239 --> 00:24:51.110
disappointing. Oh my gosh, you are so
impressive, how lovely. Mertin, I brought you some

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:54.992
papaya. I'm sorry. It's all over the floor right
now. I-- you know what, I will go get a broom, I'll

00:24:55.048 --> 00:24:56.203
clean it up right now--

00:24:56.203 --> 00:24:57.932
MATT: "No, no, don't worry about it, I insist--"

00:24:57.932 --> 00:24:59.416
FELICIA: Somebody might slip--

00:24:59.416 --> 00:25:03.612
MATT: "Stay. With your group. We have important
business to discuss. I appreciate the papaya."

00:25:03.612 --> 00:25:05.359
TRAVIS: (under his breath) She's the leader?

00:25:05.359 --> 00:25:08.025
FELICIA: Well I just wanted to-- this is my group.
Yay!

00:25:08.025 --> 00:25:09.648
(desultory yays)

00:25:09.648 --> 00:25:12.238
FELICIA: So nice to meet all of you. You are
large. You are not. You are so pretty.

00:25:12.238 --> 00:25:13.365
LAURA: Oh, you are too.

00:25:13.365 --> 00:25:15.527
FELICIA: Oh my gosh, I've heard about her, she is
something.

00:25:15.582 --> 00:25:16.751
LAURA: She is... yeah.

00:25:16.751 --> 00:25:18.082
FELICIA: Anyway. Nice to meet you, nice to meet
you.

00:25:18.082 --> 00:25:19.158
ALL: Hi.

00:25:19.158 --> 00:25:20.149
FELICIA: Hi, I'm Lyra.

00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:21.807
ALL: Lyra? Lyra.

00:25:21.807 --> 00:25:23.812
FELICIA: Yes, very nice to meet you all.

00:25:23.812 --> 00:25:28.755
MATT: And you can see from her-- she is dressed in
a nice blouse, her just-past-shoulder-length,

00:25:28.755 --> 00:25:35.520
somewhat curly hair, is kept as much as a frazzled
woman would keep. A large pair of glasses adorn

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:41.164
the front of her face, and she definitely is not
who you were expecting to be considered leading

00:25:41.214 --> 00:25:43.592
this group into its journey.

00:25:43.592 --> 00:25:44.737
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:25:44.737 --> 00:25:45.770
MARY: No.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.450
LAURA: What sort of fighter are you, Lyra?

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:50.393
FELICIA: Oh, this is so exciting. This is-- I'm
getting out Mertin, they are letting me out! This

00:25:50.393 --> 00:25:51.692
is so exciting.

00:25:51.692 --> 00:25:55.775
MATT: "This is probably a technicality. I'll have
to make sure this was maybe not--"

00:25:55.775 --> 00:25:57.018
TALIESIN: Please, yes.

00:25:57.018 --> 00:25:58.295
FELICIA: Oh, no, I don't think so.

00:25:58.295 --> 00:26:04.306
MARY: Do you find yourself sitting behind a wooden
structure most of the day? Something flat like

00:26:04.306 --> 00:26:06.997
this? Like a desk or a table?

00:26:06.997 --> 00:26:10.067
FELICIA: Oh my gosh! Do you have psy abilities?

00:26:10.067 --> 00:26:13.869
MARY: Just intuition, I guess.

00:26:13.869 --> 00:26:18.203
FELICIA: Oh, no. This is so funny. I've seen you
from afar, but I'm very busy in the back room. You

00:26:18.203 --> 00:26:21.632
know, I'm very-- I'm invaluable. Right, Mertin?

00:26:21.632 --> 00:26:24.266
MATT: "She is. Useful. Yes."

00:26:24.266 --> 00:26:27.977
FELICIA: Yes. I'm very good at alphabetizing.
Listen, we are going to catch up so much. I'm just

00:26:27.977 --> 00:26:31.945
really excited. They are letting me out, Mertin!

00:26:32.001 --> 00:26:34.161
SAM: Have you led a group like this before?

00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:37.293
FELICIA: No, it's so funny. You wouldn't be able
to tell, right?

00:26:37.293 --> 00:26:38.718
TRAVIS and LAURA: Not at all.

00:26:38.718 --> 00:26:41.240
MARY: You seem very experienced.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.497
TRAVIS: Veteran.

00:26:42.497 --> 00:26:43.821
LAURA: Very in-charge.

00:26:43.821 --> 00:26:47.559
FELICIA: Thank you. Thank you. I mean, listen. I
just wanted to welcome everybody. No, no. They

00:26:47.559 --> 00:26:52.670
don't actually let me out a lot and I was-- you
know-- when I got the scroll in front ... it was

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:57.575
just-- This is my best robe.

00:26:57.575 --> 00:27:00.022
MARY: You've got a little papaya juice on the
front of it

00:27:00.022 --> 00:27:04.939
FELICIA: Oh no, oh no, oh no! And then I'm like
brushing it and accidentally-- the robe falls off.

00:27:04.939 --> 00:27:09.457
(gasp) Oh my god! That was inadvertent.

00:27:09.457 --> 00:27:16.022
MATT: You hear this awkward smack sound as Mertin
has face-palmed, as unbelievably hard as he can,

00:27:16.022 --> 00:27:28.726
at the edge of his desk. "I shall retrieve the
Huntmaster." Then he gets up and leaves. You guys

00:27:28.726 --> 00:27:30.863
are left alone in the foyer for a moment.

00:27:30.863 --> 00:27:36.094
SAM: So Lyra, you are already a full fledged
slayer?

00:27:36.094 --> 00:27:37.664
FELICIA: I am, in fact.

00:27:37.664 --> 00:27:39.041
SAM: Have you slain?

00:27:39.041 --> 00:27:42.498
FELICIA: I am a member of the guild. Well, if you
want to be technical--

00:27:42.498 --> 00:27:44.432
SAM: You seem like someone from The Guild.

00:27:44.432 --> 00:27:48.739
FELICIA: Yes, I'm a guild member. It's funny
because it's kind of a technicality. I don't know

00:27:48.739 --> 00:27:50.791
how that happened, but I'm here.

00:27:50.791 --> 00:27:53.130
LAURA: What do you normally do? Bookkeeping?
Storage?

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:57.230
FELICIA: Oh, well. It's a really long story. Can I
tell you all about it?

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:58.928
SAM: Abridged. Abridged.

00:27:58.928 --> 00:28:00.753
LAURA: Grog look, papaya.

00:28:00.953 --> 00:28:01.967
TRAVIS: Rah!

00:28:01.967 --> 00:28:03.704
FELICIA: I guess some of it's still clean.

00:28:03.704 --> 00:28:04.939
SAM: He doesn't care.

00:28:05.091 --> 00:28:06.654
TRAVIS: It's still good.

00:28:06.654 --> 00:28:07.953
FELICIA: Yes, so.

00:28:07.953 --> 00:28:11.072
LAURA: And Trinket, Trinket too. This is my bear.

00:28:11.072 --> 00:28:12.364
SAM: Oh, do we get Trinket?

00:28:12.364 --> 00:28:13.544
LAURA: Yes, of course we get Trinket!

00:28:13.544 --> 00:28:14.784
Scanlan Do we get Trinket on the trip?

00:28:14.784 --> 00:28:18.180
MATT: As you turn, you see that the door after you
pass, and the giant armored bear has made its way

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:23.891
in and pushes past your shoulder abruptly. And
immediately goes nose down and joins Grog, eating

00:28:23.891 --> 00:28:25.168
papaya off of the ground.

00:28:25.168 --> 00:28:26.788
TRAVIS: Hey, get your own papaya.

00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:27.771
LAURA: This is Trinket.

00:28:27.771 --> 00:28:29.461
MARY: Fascinating. What kind of bear is he?

00:28:29.461 --> 00:28:30.256
TALIESIN: A big one.

00:28:30.256 --> 00:28:31.433
LAURA: A brown one.

00:28:31.433 --> 00:28:34.977
TRAVIS: We start to wrestle. Gently. That's my
papaya you-- let go!

00:28:34.977 --> 00:28:40.067
FELICIA: Does anyone have any allergies, if I take
some to-go lunches?

00:28:40.067 --> 00:28:42.054
LAURA: Oh, that would be lovely actually.

00:28:42.054 --> 00:28:43.286
TRAVIS: Cats.

00:28:43.286 --> 00:28:44.997
LAURA: Actually I think Percy is quite hungry.

00:28:44.997 --> 00:28:48.274
TALIESIN: I actually am quite hungry. I was-- I
don't know if I am quite capable of eating papaya

00:28:48.274 --> 00:28:54.108
off the floor, but if there is, I don't
know, something brunchy?

00:28:54.154 --> 00:28:56.974
TRAVIS: I have some dried food rations. Would you
want one of those?

00:28:56.974 --> 00:28:58.411
TALIESIN: It will do in a pinch.

00:28:58.411 --> 00:28:59.674
FELICIA: Here is a crumbled biscuit.

00:28:59.674 --> 00:29:02.093
TALIESIN: A crumbled biscuit sounds-- I like her
already, that will do.

00:29:02.093 --> 00:29:03.490
TRAVIS: I will remember this slight.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:06.610
SAM: So have you slain-- have you had any battle
experience at all?

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:14.120
FELICIA: Well, it's funny. I'm actually from this
city, but I was in Emon, and I was studying. I'm a

00:29:14.179 --> 00:29:16.155
wizard. You know, the wizardly arts.

00:29:16.155 --> 00:29:17.627
SAM: Oh, I've heard of them yes.

00:29:17.627 --> 00:29:18.704
FELICIA: Yes absolutely.

00:29:18.704 --> 00:29:20.756
SAM: I dabble with them myself.

00:29:20.756 --> 00:29:26.217
FELICIA: Exactly. My uncle is actually the
diplomat from Emon here, in Vasselheim.

00:29:26.217 --> 00:29:28.047
SAM: Oh, we are from Emon, as well.

00:29:28.047 --> 00:29:29.212
FELICIA: That's so funny.

00:29:29.212 --> 00:29:30.573
LAURA: Perhaps you've heard of us?

00:29:30.573 --> 00:29:31.788
SAM: Vox Machina?

00:29:31.788 --> 00:29:33.501
LAURA: Castle Greyskull Keep.

00:29:33.501 --> 00:29:36.212
SAM: Castle Greyskull. Some know us as the
S.H.I.Ts.

00:29:36.212 --> 00:29:37.715
TALIESIN: Kind of a big deal.

00:29:37.715 --> 00:29:43.838
FELICIA: No. No, but I would love to hear all
about it. I'll put it on a scroll. Anyway, so I

00:29:43.838 --> 00:29:52.735
came here because my boyfriend, Aldor, is here. He
is going to be my boyfriend. It's a long story.

00:29:52.735 --> 00:29:55.368
SAM: We've met Aldor.

00:29:55.368 --> 00:29:57.209
LAURA: We have?!

00:29:57.209 --> 00:29:58.255
SAM: We have.

00:29:58.255 --> 00:29:59.990
LAURA: Where did we meet Aldor?

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:01.103
SAM: Yes, we met Aldor.

00:30:01.103 --> 00:30:03.258
MATT: He was the leader of the team that found you
guys in the forest.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.196
TRAVIS: That's right!

00:30:04.196 --> 00:30:05.552
LAURA: (gasps) That guy!

00:30:05.552 --> 00:30:10.022
SAM: We tangled with him. Our first run in with
Aldor was not fortuitous.

00:30:10.022 --> 00:30:12.079
FELICIA: Did he look good? Did he look healthy?

00:30:12.079 --> 00:30:14.895
LAURA: I mean, he looked kind of like a dick. If
you want my personal opinion but--

00:30:14.895 --> 00:30:16.689
SAM: She means he was--

00:30:16.689 --> 00:30:17.623
TALIESIN: Strapping!

00:30:17.623 --> 00:30:19.047
SAM: Strapping, like a dick.

00:30:19.047 --> 00:30:22.562
FELICIA: Well he is very large, and we won't talk
about that area. I have seen it, but let's not talk

00:30:22.562 --> 00:30:28.659
about that either.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:32.037
TRAVIS: What is your weapon of choice, Lyra?

00:30:32.222 --> 00:30:38.104
FELICIA: Oh, I have a wand. I have a wand. It's
right here. See? It's not very long.

00:30:38.104 --> 00:30:39.905
MARY: What's it made of?

00:30:39.905 --> 00:30:45.370
FELICIA: Oh, it's ash. Which-- it's
lovely. It's very nice. Do you want to know more

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:46.342
about it?

00:30:46.342 --> 00:30:47.637
MARY: I would love to.

00:30:47.637 --> 00:30:52.530
MATT: At which point the Huntmaster arrives.
Vanessa Cyndrial steps into the room and looks

00:30:52.530 --> 00:31:00.059
about the rest. "Very nice to see that you've all
gathered your teams for the day, and I am also

00:31:00.116 --> 00:31:05.810
"curious to see your first foray into leading a
group of slayers yourself, Lyra."

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:10.376
FELICIA: Well, I just want to thank you. Thank
you, Vanessa. Thank you for entrusting me with

00:31:10.376 --> 00:31:18.262
this group. I have been reading up a lot, lately.
I'm very excited to use the commanding presence of

00:31:18.262 --> 00:31:21.288
a guild leader, and prove my membership of the
guild.

00:31:21.288 --> 00:31:23.845
LAURA: I would like to thank you very much, as
well.

00:31:23.845 --> 00:31:24.987
TRAVIS: (muffled) Yeah, me too.

00:31:24.987 --> 00:31:28.726
LAURA: For putting us in her capable hands.

00:31:28.726 --> 00:31:36.817
MATT: "This was a... more of a choice of
convenience, and a test universally. As you are a

00:31:36.817 --> 00:31:44.370
"team of unproven fighters, in the eyes of the
guildhall, and, well. We have a relatively

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:46.758
"unproven member, as well."

00:31:46.758 --> 00:31:48.953
FELICIA: Well. I mean, I'm a member.

00:31:48.953 --> 00:31:55.957
MATT: "Technically, yes. However, I think that her
knowledge and experience would be of very good use

00:31:55.957 --> 00:31:57.435
"on such a trek."

00:31:57.435 --> 00:32:02.212
MARY: Yes, it should prove to be quite
educational, I would think.

00:32:02.212 --> 00:32:05.003
SAM: We'll learn a lot from hearing her talk.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.913
FELICIA: Yay! Thank you.

00:32:06.913 --> 00:32:09.171
SAM: You're welcome.

00:32:09.171 --> 00:32:12.802
TALIESIN: You should try the biscuits. They are
slaying me. That's all I know.

00:32:12.802 --> 00:32:16.712
LAURA: What do you eat? Do you eat-- does it get
stuck in your teeth a lot?

00:32:16.712 --> 00:32:25.216
MARY: Well, it does sometimes, but you grab a twig
and just work it out after a while. Gives you a

00:32:25.216 --> 00:32:27.008
little something later to chew on.

00:32:27.008 --> 00:32:29.189
TRAVIS: Twigs work great. Don't they? I like
twigs.

00:32:29.189 --> 00:32:32.351
SAM: Don't we have some guilds to prove membership
to?

00:32:32.351 --> 00:32:35.966
TRAVIS: Yeah, can we kill something now please,
before we learn anything else.

00:32:35.966 --> 00:32:40.769
MATT: She snaps her fingers loudly, and Mertin
comes rushing from around the corner carrying

00:32:40.769 --> 00:32:46.657
something in his arms. "As you are on this journey
for us, and for the guild, and your own personal

00:32:46.657 --> 00:32:52.410
"name and title within our establishment, we would
like to provide you with a semblance of

00:32:52.470 --> 00:33:01.401
"protection, or at least a useful little package. A
gift, from us to you." She puts her hand on the

00:33:01.401 --> 00:33:07.326
table and Mertin comes over and hands you what
looks like a small leather chest. It's made of

00:33:07.326 --> 00:33:10.997
sculpted leather. Rolls back, and pushes it
forward. You can hear the clinking of glass as he

00:33:10.997 --> 00:33:16.326
does so, and on the inside you can see there are
four glass vials, prepared with some sort of a

00:33:16.326 --> 00:33:22.442
swirling red, silver-ish liquid inside. You
recognize these as healing-based potions.

00:33:22.633 --> 00:33:24.436
SAM: Like Moderate Healing?

00:33:24.436 --> 00:33:26.848
LAURA: Superior? Perhaps.

00:33:26.848 --> 00:33:32.116
MATT: These would constitute as Greater Healing
Potions, and there are four in total. You can

00:33:32.116 --> 00:33:33.768
distribute as you see fit.

00:33:33.768 --> 00:33:35.654
SAM: I think the members of Vox Machina should get
them.

00:33:35.654 --> 00:33:39.328
LAURA: That doesn't seem really--

00:33:39.328 --> 00:33:41.415
MARY: Is that what you think?

00:33:41.415 --> 00:33:44.301
SAM: Well, just because I-- I defer to--

00:33:44.301 --> 00:33:49.981
FELICIA: As the leader, I enjoy being hospitable,
and I agree with this small person.

00:33:50.026 --> 00:33:53.062
MARY: Well Scanlan, if you feel you need it.

00:33:53.062 --> 00:33:56.214
TALIESIN: I already have a couple, so I will
gladly give one to somebody

00:33:56.214 --> 00:33:57.120
who is going to need it.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.704
LAURA: I've got plenty. Take it. If you need it.

00:33:58.704 --> 00:34:00.436
MARY: I have plenty myself. Thank you very much.

00:34:00.436 --> 00:34:02.867
SAM: I will. More for me.

00:34:02.867 --> 00:34:10.487
MATT: "Very well. Now that we have this situated.
Has everyone gathered the provisions they require

00:34:10.487 --> 00:34:12.694
"for this journey? Are you ready to embark?"

00:34:12.694 --> 00:34:15.295
TRAVIS: I mean, we don't have a body bag for some
of these chumps.

00:34:15.295 --> 00:34:17.178
SAM: Did you eat enough, Percy?

00:34:17.178 --> 00:34:19.078
TALIESIN: The biscuit was very filling. It was
extremely filling.

00:34:19.078 --> 00:34:25.435
FELICIA: You're very welcome. I can get some more.
Can I just go to the kitchen and grab some-- no?

00:34:25.435 --> 00:34:34.344
MATT: "Anyway. This is a secondary gift.
Temporarily lent out for your contracts." Mertin

00:34:34.344 --> 00:34:39.880
brings up what looks like another satchel. It has
a series of metal snaps across the top. These

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:46.326
little buttons that snap together and enclose it
entirely. It's an over-the-shoulder-type throw. As

00:34:46.372 --> 00:34:52.000
he opens it and you look inside, it resembles the bag
of holding, but it's not quite a bag of holding.

00:34:52.144 --> 00:35:00.555
"This is used for the transportation of, how do
you say, perishable aspects of your quarry. Things

00:35:00.555 --> 00:35:06.346
"that you would harvest from the creature you have
been assigned tend to, depending on the creature,

00:35:06.346 --> 00:35:13.849
"rot away within a very short period of time. When
placed within this, they should be sustained for a

00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:19.463
"few weeks at the very least. So, please do be very
mindful and careful of this. Should it be lost,

00:35:19.463 --> 00:35:24.500
"there is a very small chance you will be able to
fulfill your contract. So, who shall be taking

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.198
"this on the journey?"

00:35:26.343 --> 00:35:28.591
SAM: You've already go the bag of holding.

00:35:28.649 --> 00:35:29.838
LAURA: I'll hold onto it.

00:35:29.838 --> 00:35:30.882
MARY: I shall.

00:35:30.882 --> 00:35:31.844
TALIESIN: You're kind of stealthy aren't you?

00:35:31.844 --> 00:35:32.669
MARY: I shall take it.

00:35:32.669 --> 00:35:33.642
LAURA: I shall take it.

00:35:33.642 --> 00:35:34.486
MARY: I shall take it.

00:35:34.486 --> 00:35:35.299
LAURA: I will--

00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:36.214
TRAVIS: Roll for it.

00:35:36.214 --> 00:35:38.340
SAM: Why don't we roll for-- Why don't we flip a
coin for it?

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.225
MARY: Do you know Roshambo?

00:35:40.225 --> 00:35:41.546
SAM: That would be great.

00:35:41.546 --> 00:35:43.573
LAURA: Ha!

00:35:43.573 --> 00:35:47.060
MARY: Congratulations, I'm so happy for you.

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.201
SAM: Oh, wait. Should we ask the leader of the
group, here?

00:35:49.201 --> 00:35:50.339
MARY: I'm so sorry.

00:35:50.339 --> 00:35:51.311
LAURA: Sorry Lyra.

00:35:51.311 --> 00:35:53.618
FELICIA: Oh that's quite all right. Thank you for
actually including me.

00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:54.690
LAURA: Of course.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:57.768
FELICIA: As the leader of this party, I will agree
with the roshambo.

00:35:57.768 --> 00:36:00.736
SAM: (chuckles) So it is decreed.

00:36:00.736 --> 00:36:07.227
MARY: Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean for my tail to
hit you in your rear end so sharply. Sometimes it

00:36:07.227 --> 00:36:08.499
has a mind of its own.

00:36:08.499 --> 00:36:09.894
LAURA: It's like a whip.

00:36:09.894 --> 00:36:11.378
MARY: I know.

00:36:11.378 --> 00:36:15.935
MATT: At which point Vanessa is just watching with
a grin on her face. "It is good to see you have

00:36:15.935 --> 00:36:21.671
"already established a pecking order within your
traveling companions. This bodes well for your

00:36:21.671 --> 00:36:26.810
"journey, most certainly. To you." And she hands
you the satchel.

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:31.318
LAURA: (gasps) But I won. I won. Give it to me.
What? Please.

00:36:31.318 --> 00:36:33.615
MARY: I'm sorry, I don't think it was given to
you.

00:36:33.615 --> 00:36:38.841
LAURA: I already have it. I already have it on my
shoulder. It's too late. I'm writing it down.

00:36:38.841 --> 00:36:43.529
MARY: I certainly hope you don't lose it during
our quest.

00:36:43.529 --> 00:36:47.615
TRAVIS: Vanessa, I have a question. What happens
if we don't come back

00:36:47.615 --> 00:36:50.274
with all of the members we left with?

00:36:50.274 --> 00:36:53.370
MATT: "Well, then I suppose they would not be
allowed into the guildhall."

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:54.449
TRAVIS: Oh, good.

00:36:54.449 --> 00:36:58.719
MATT: "Mostly for no longer returning to the city
of Vasselheim, but that is not our problem. There

00:36:58.719 --> 00:37:01.556
"is danger in this which I should get to,
actually."

00:37:01.556 --> 00:37:03.156
SAM: Yes, please tell us. Where are we going?

00:37:03.156 --> 00:37:08.067
MATT: "You have now received your gifts and your
various required implements for this journey. A

00:37:08.067 --> 00:37:14.460
"contract has just recently come to us from the
Crown of Erathis, within this portion of the city.

00:37:14.522 --> 00:37:23.734
"It has been approved for slaying. This will prove
quite a challenge. Based on how highly you spoke

00:37:23.734 --> 00:37:30.383
"of your abilities, I will warn you. The quarry is
quite dangerous. Should you find yourself in

00:37:30.383 --> 00:37:41.728
"trouble, I wish to remind you that it is better to
live and fail, than to be foolish and die. Let me

00:37:41.728 --> 00:37:46.782
"pass on to you the contract that has been
selected for you." Then she reaches out and hands

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:55.175
this over to you, Percy.

00:37:55.236 --> 00:37:58.614
SAM: Should Lyra?

00:37:58.675 --> 00:38:03.871
FELICIA: Oh no, let me try. Oh no! Maybe you
should read it.

00:38:03.916 --> 00:38:06.487
MARY: I cast Mending on it.

00:38:06.487 --> 00:38:09.857
SAM: You can do that? So sexy.

00:38:09.857 --> 00:38:15.594
MATT: As she flicks her wrist a small spark of
purple-ish dark energy shoots from her finger,

00:38:15.594 --> 00:38:19.858
slams into the side of the contract, and the tear
in the contract repairs itself immediately.

00:38:19.905 --> 00:38:21.961
FELICIA: Oh wow.

00:38:21.961 --> 00:38:24.972
TALIESIN: Scotch tape would do it too.

00:38:24.972 --> 00:38:29.252
MARY: The Scots have nothing to do with it.

00:38:29.252 --> 00:38:32.726
TALIESIN: "Ordered and paid in advance by the
alchemist Oswind Grund, the client... This

00:38:32.726 --> 00:38:36.418
"contract, binding in honor of the elements, set

00:38:47.572 --> 00:38:51.271
"will be deducted from the final payment, and will
be refunded to the client. This client--"

00:38:51.271 --> 00:38:54.380
MARY: I'm sorry, could you go over, again, what we
are harvesting, please?

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:55.946
TALIESIN: Ah, we haven't gotten to that yet.

00:38:55.946 --> 00:38:56.847
MARY: Sorry.

00:38:56.847 --> 00:38:59.345
TALIESIN: Oh, it's all right. "This contract is
good for three days, and should the contract not

00:38:59.345 --> 00:39:02.875
"be fulfilled within that time period, then all

00:39:02.875 --> 00:39:06.315
"and void, and the membership within the Slayer's
Take is revoked, outside of the Huntmaster's

"willful forgiveness."

00:39:07.602 --> 00:39:09.600
SAM: This is the fine print, get to the details.

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:14.080
TALIESIN: "Quarry has been approved for hunting by
the Holy Paramounts of the Crown of Erathis. The

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.524
quarry: one adult white dragon--" One adult white
dragon?!

00:39:17.524 --> 00:39:23.840
LAURA: A white dragon? Would I know? I would know,
because I've studied them.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:31.654
MATT: Yes, having dragons being a very favored
enemy for you. White dragons are one of the

00:39:31.724 --> 00:39:39.860
chromatic dragon circle. They are considered
largely very spiteful, arrogant, a little more

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.676
bestial, and very, very dangerous foes.

00:39:42.676 --> 00:39:44.523
MARY: Yes, they are glorious.

00:39:44.523 --> 00:39:46.514
LAURA: Didn't we kill a white dragon?

00:39:46.514 --> 00:39:47.842
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: No.

00:39:47.842 --> 00:39:49.030
SAM: Platinum dragon?

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.939
LAURA: No, I thought the ice dragon thing-- wasn't
she white?

00:39:51.939 --> 00:39:56.238
MATT: Once upon a time, you battled, back at
Westruun.

00:39:56.238 --> 00:39:58.379
SAM: I don't see race so I don't know.

00:39:58.379 --> 00:40:01.705
FELICIA: What kind of element is a white dragon?

00:40:01.705 --> 00:40:03.592
MATT: Ice and frost.

00:40:03.638 --> 00:40:05.513
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right.

00:40:05.513 --> 00:40:08.581
LAURA: Yeah, the woman and then she turned into a
dragon.

00:40:08.581 --> 00:40:10.761
TRAVIS: Yeah, Ashley killed her. I mean, Pike.

00:40:10.761 --> 00:40:15.448
MATT: "This bodes well. If you have already
defeated such a creature, then this should be a

00:40:15.448 --> 00:40:16.884
"very simple task."

00:40:16.884 --> 00:40:18.241
TRAVIS: Yeah, no problem.

00:40:18.241 --> 00:40:19.525
FELICIA: This is going to be easy.

00:40:19.525 --> 00:40:20.883
TRAVIS: What do we have to bring back?

00:40:20.883 --> 00:40:23.068
TALIESIN: They want eyes, tongue, heart, claws,
and teeth.

00:40:23.068 --> 00:40:25.124
LAURA: So anything else we get to keep ourselves?

00:40:25.124 --> 00:40:30.675
TALIESIN: Two eyes, one tongue, one heart, six
claws, and 20 teeth, is what they are requesting.

00:40:30.675 --> 00:40:33.325
SAM: And do we get paid for such items?

00:40:33.325 --> 00:40:39.456
TALIESIN: Yes. There are individual prices for
each individual object. Eyes, 900 gold each.

00:40:39.456 --> 00:40:47.569
Tongue is 1,200 gold. The heart is 3,500. Claws,
250 gold each, and teeth are 50 gold each.

00:40:47.569 --> 00:40:50.774
FELICIA: If there are any remaining organs, we can
roshambo for it.

00:40:50.774 --> 00:40:53.508
MATT: "Very good."

00:40:53.508 --> 00:40:55.547
LAURA: And scales, definitely. There will be
plenty of scales.

00:40:55.547 --> 00:40:56.678
TALIESIN: Plenty of scales.

00:40:56.678 --> 00:40:58.885
MARY: Yes, there will be plenty of scales. Very
good for armor and--

00:40:58.885 --> 00:41:00.671
TALIESIN: Very good for armor.

00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:02.909
TRAVIS: Does it say where this dragon lives?

00:41:02.909 --> 00:41:04.384
TALIESIN: No.

00:41:04.384 --> 00:41:12.981
MATT: "Ah, see. That is part of the job. To find
one's quarry is why we are so specialized, in the

00:41:12.981 --> 00:41:20.784
"Slayer's Take. You may now embark. Once we signify
the pact of the contract." And as she reaches out

00:41:20.784 --> 00:41:25.422
and touches the edge of it, you can see there are
these arcane sigils that are on the contract

00:41:25.422 --> 00:41:31.455
itself. They glow and pulse briefly and she just
walks across the group. First, to you Percy, as

00:41:31.455 --> 00:41:36.925
you were holding it. "Place your hand against the
contract." As you do they light up, and you feel a

00:41:36.925 --> 00:41:42.006
surge of warm energy go through your torso. At
which point, you now see, at the bottom of the

00:41:42.006 --> 00:41:49.466
contract, your name inscribe itself, magically,
into the contract. She then takes it and passes it

00:41:49.466 --> 00:41:54.728
to each one of you to the same point. As the spell
binds--

00:41:54.728 --> 00:41:58.044
LAURA: What about Trinket? Does he use his paw?

00:41:58.044 --> 00:42:03.506
MATT: "I suppose he is part of your band." And she
reaches out the paper.

00:42:03.506 --> 00:42:05.350
LAURA: Trinket. Shake.

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:10.715
MATT: Slams it out of her hand, knocking the
contract onto the ground, and there is a brief

00:42:10.715 --> 00:42:16.950
moment where she pulls the paw back and the paper
is wrecked a little bit, but there is indeed a paw

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:23.810
that inscribes itself on the bottom of the
contract for Trinket's insignia. "Now, I have a

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:29.992
"busy day to attend. I wish you the utmost of
safety, good luck, and safe travels."

00:42:29.992 --> 00:42:31.578
SAM: Thank you, I guess.

00:42:31.578 --> 00:42:38.547
FELICIA: Bye! I'll alphabetize the rest of those
ingredients when I get back. Don't worry. It's

00:42:38.547 --> 00:42:39.609
going to be fine.

00:42:39.609 --> 00:42:41.537
MATT: "I'd appreciate that, good luck."

00:42:41.537 --> 00:42:43.976
FELICIA: Okay, great. Bye-bye. Thanks again for
giving me a chance.

00:42:43.976 --> 00:42:45.490
MATT: "That's great. Please, go."

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:46.346
FELICIA: Okay.

00:42:46.346 --> 00:42:47.773
SAM: Are you the housekeeper here?

00:42:47.773 --> 00:42:52.667
FELICIA: No, no. Listen. No, I am a guild member.
On a technicality, but I am a guild member.

00:42:52.667 --> 00:42:54.822
MARY: Tell me again, what have you slain?

00:42:54.822 --> 00:42:56.552
FELICIA: Well, well, it's--

00:42:56.552 --> 00:43:02.029
MARY: No, very abbreviated, just a short-- can you
say the word of what it is.

00:43:02.029 --> 00:43:04.056
LAURA: Just the biggest one.

00:43:04.056 --> 00:43:09.563
FELICIA: It was a worg. Who almost absconded with
my boyfriend, Aldor.

00:43:09.563 --> 00:43:11.617
And at the last minute I interceded.

00:43:11.617 --> 00:43:13.916
LAURA: You killed someone who was sleeping with
your boyfriend?

00:43:13.916 --> 00:43:15.969
FELICIA: No, no. It was worg. A worg!

00:43:15.969 --> 00:43:16.906
LAURA: Okay.

00:43:16.906 --> 00:43:18.732
SAM: Is that a thing?

00:43:18.732 --> 00:43:19.796
FELICIA: It's a thing

00:43:19.796 --> 00:43:21.209
SAM: We haven't encountered one of those, I don't
think.

00:43:21.209 --> 00:43:22.805
LAURA: It's a person that changes into animals, am
I right?

00:43:22.805 --> 00:43:26.511
MARY: No, it's something that-- it projects itself
into animals?

00:43:26.511 --> 00:43:29.971
MATT: In certain book series, yes.

00:43:29.971 --> 00:43:34.097
(laughter)

00:43:34.097 --> 00:43:39.378
MARY: I'm a very prolific reader. And I've never
read of worgs other than in that circumstance.

00:43:39.378 --> 00:43:42.170
SAM: In Twilight, that's true.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:45.048
MARY: That could have been the fairy tale section
of the library.

00:43:45.048 --> 00:43:47.144
TRAVIS: It also sparkles. Sparkles in the
sunlight.

00:43:47.144 --> 00:43:48.566
MARY: But only in the sun.

00:43:48.566 --> 00:43:54.806
MATT: Worgs in this world are essentially a side
breed of large bulbous, wolf-like entities.

00:43:54.806 --> 00:43:56.117
ALL: Oh!

00:43:56.117 --> 00:43:57.926
MARY: A bulbous dire wolf.

00:43:57.926 --> 00:43:59.235
LAURA: Oh you killed a wolf?

00:43:59.235 --> 00:44:00.523
MARY: A bloated wolf, basically?

00:44:00.523 --> 00:44:01.716
FELICIA: It's a large wolf.

00:44:01.716 --> 00:44:03.087
MATT: It's not quite dire wolf sized.

00:44:03.087 --> 00:44:04.270
LAURA: No, yeah, that's great.

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:05.532
MARY: A gaseous wolf?

00:44:05.532 --> 00:44:08.681
MATT: For instance-- out of character here,
outside of the world. In Lord of the Rings, the

00:44:08.681 --> 00:44:10.135
things that the orcs ride.

00:44:10.135 --> 00:44:11.481
ALL: Oh!

00:44:11.481 --> 00:44:12.827
LAURA: Oh, they're really scary.

00:44:12.827 --> 00:44:18.734
FELICIA: It was quite a situation. It was either
the worg or Aldor, and I would do anything to save

00:44:18.734 --> 00:44:21.298
Aldor. What did he look like, when you saw him?

00:44:21.298 --> 00:44:22.868
TRAVIS: Oh god, here we go again.

00:44:22.868 --> 00:44:24.124
SAM: He was a little dirty.

00:44:24.124 --> 00:44:26.058
LAURA: I mean, he looked actually kind of
frightened.

00:44:26.058 --> 00:44:30.482
FELICIA: Was he wearing armor? Like, a
red-ish sort of very fantastic armor?

00:44:30.543 --> 00:44:34.063
SAM: It was hard to focus on his armor with all of
his screaming and panting.

00:44:34.063 --> 00:44:35.655
LAURA: And whimpering, really.

00:44:35.655 --> 00:44:37.303
FELICIA: He is very brave. He must have been
injured.

00:44:37.303 --> 00:44:39.373
LAURA: No, yes, he seems like he would have been
had he hadn't--

00:44:39.373 --> 00:44:41.616
SAM: We tease because we love. He did fine. He
fought well. He fought bravely,

00:44:41.616 --> 00:44:42.800
and he treated us fairly.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.979
LAURA: Especially when he got burned by Tiberius.

00:44:44.979 --> 00:44:47.927
FELICIA: You burned my.... kind-of-boyfriend?!

00:44:47.927 --> 00:44:49.545
SAM: Not the face. Not the face.

00:44:49.545 --> 00:44:50.813
LAURA: His face is fine.

00:44:50.813 --> 00:44:51.902
SAM: I didn't do it.

00:44:51.902 --> 00:44:53.930
FELICIA: We need to talk about this more on the
road, but we should get going.

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:55.208
SAM: Let's certainly start talking.

00:44:55.208 --> 00:44:56.451
MARY: Yes, let's do.

00:44:56.451 --> 00:45:00.040
MATT: As you all leave, the Huntmaster expectantly
waiting for you to exit the guildhall, you find

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:06.853
yourself out amongst the streets of Vasselheim.
With no particular direction in where to find the

00:45:06.853 --> 00:45:08.411
white dragon in three days.

00:45:08.411 --> 00:45:09.523
LAURA: Three days?

00:45:09.523 --> 00:45:10.908
MATT: Three days to slay it, yes.

00:45:10.908 --> 00:45:14.053
SAM: Hey, Vex. Can any of us sense a dragon within
six miles of here?

00:45:14.053 --> 00:45:15.628
LAURA: That's what I'm doing. I'm checking that
out.

00:45:15.628 --> 00:45:17.660
FELICIA: Oh, yes. I can cast Locate Creature too.

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:18.927
LAURA: Oh, that works too.

00:45:18.927 --> 00:45:20.359
FELICIA: Yeah, let's do it. Together.

00:45:20.359 --> 00:45:23.359
SAM: Do we need some sort of-- anything for you to
cast the spell?

00:45:23.359 --> 00:45:24.787
FELICIA: Oh no, I have all of my ingredients.

00:45:24.787 --> 00:45:27.406
SAM: No, but do you need to know something of what
you are trying to locate?

00:45:27.406 --> 00:45:29.743
Or does it work on name alone?

00:45:29.743 --> 00:45:35.107
MATT: As per the Locate Creature spell, it can
only locate creatures within 1,000 feet of the

00:45:35.107 --> 00:45:38.958
ritual that is completed. But it locates them with
pinpoint accuracy.

00:45:38.958 --> 00:45:43.417
LAURA: Oh, that's great. Well then we can use it
in conjunction. Because I can use Primeval

00:45:43.417 --> 00:45:45.743
Awareness and find any dragons within six miles.

00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:46.954
FELICIA: Oh you are very skilled.

00:45:46.954 --> 00:45:50.069
TRAVIS: Can I try to grow my beard, real quick?

00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:51.316
MARY: You can grow a beard?

00:45:51.316 --> 00:45:52.337
MATT: Yes.

00:45:52.337 --> 00:45:53.312
SAM: Sometimes.

00:45:53.312 --> 00:45:54.182
TALIESIN: Not really.

00:45:54.182 --> 00:45:55.216
TRAVIS: 33.

00:45:55.216 --> 00:45:56.469
SAM: That's better, that's better.

00:45:56.469 --> 00:45:59.202
MATT: At this point, and you guys noticed it and
didn't make a mention, because for some of you

00:45:59.202 --> 00:46:04.820
this was just a very dire morning. But since Grog
woke up this morning he had a very, very nice coat

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:09.458
of somewhat bristly, translucent-- not very
attractive facial hair,

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.294
but facial hair by definition.

00:46:12.294 --> 00:46:15.080
LAURA: It's like fishing line coming out of his
face.

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.466
TRAVIS: I'm a damn pirate now. Watch out.

00:46:17.466 --> 00:46:21.187
TALIESIN: Like a 14 year old whose father doesn't
love him enough to

00:46:21.187 --> 00:46:22.815
teach him how to groom himself.

00:46:22.815 --> 00:46:26.127
TRAVIS: (laughs) Jesus... Oh. Wow.

00:46:26.127 --> 00:46:27.893
SAM: That's dark.

00:46:27.893 --> 00:46:29.857
TRAVIS: There's a story there.

00:46:29.857 --> 00:46:33.263
LAURA: Percy's seen some shit.

00:46:33.263 --> 00:46:35.179
MARY: Yeah!

00:46:35.179 --> 00:46:37.965
TALIESIN: There's no parental issues over here.
None.

00:46:37.965 --> 00:46:40.845
LAURA: So, can I do that then?

00:46:40.845 --> 00:46:45.980
MATT: You can. You, along with Trinket by your
side, you find a small space--

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.106
LAURA: I can't find his exact location, but I
can...

00:46:48.106 --> 00:46:49.597
MATT: You can gather the general--

00:46:49.597 --> 00:46:51.386
MARY: How far away are we, from the wood, at this
point?

00:46:51.386 --> 00:46:54.917
MATT: You are still in the city of Vasselheim. You
are in the Quadroads district, which is the most

00:46:54.917 --> 00:47:01.641
central portion of the city-- it's the Erathis
driven area. You are about a 15 minute walk from

00:47:01.641 --> 00:47:04.417
the nearest walls that exit out into the Vesper
Timberlands.

00:47:04.417 --> 00:47:05.458
TRAVIS: 15.

00:47:05.458 --> 00:47:08.275
FELICIA: Do I know anything about where the dragon
might be?

00:47:08.275 --> 00:47:13.320
MATT: You have no idea. This would be one of those
occasions where your best bet would be research or

00:47:13.467 --> 00:47:14.790
asking around.

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:16.540
TRAVIS: Dragon! Drag--!

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.632
SAM: No, don't do that.

00:47:18.632 --> 00:47:20.328
LAURA: So can I--?

00:47:20.328 --> 00:47:23.861
MATT: So, you take a moment, you ground yourself,
and you place your hands on the dirt and take in

00:47:23.861 --> 00:47:30.013
the general feel of all natural creatures and 
unnatural beasts that you are attuned to in the

00:47:30.062 --> 00:47:36.136
vicinity. You focus on the essence of what is
dragon and dragonkin, dragon kind. And

00:47:36.203 --> 00:47:41.971
find that within the six mile radius, there is
nothing that catches your attention.

00:47:41.971 --> 00:47:43.113
LAURA: Shit.

00:47:43.113 --> 00:47:47.296
SAM: All right. Lyra. Lira? Lyra.

00:47:47.296 --> 00:47:50.085
FELICIA: Lyra. Thank you for asking because some
people just don't care.

00:47:50.085 --> 00:47:56.214
SAM: Yes, well I want to get it right. Who--
you've been living here for quite some time, I

00:47:56.214 --> 00:47:57.542
imagine, as a guild member.

00:47:57.542 --> 00:48:01.209
FELICIA: Well, I grew up here, with my uncle--
Uncle Randy. Do you want to meet him?

00:48:01.209 --> 00:48:06.585
SAM: No. Unless he is knowledgeable about dragons.
I was going to ask you where should we go to ask

00:48:06.585 --> 00:48:11.357
who might know things about the woods, about the
wilds, about where dragons might keep?

00:48:11.548 --> 00:48:14.952
FELICIA: That's a very good question. I would say
Aldor, but he will not talk to me.

00:48:14.952 --> 00:48:18.592
SAM: That's unfortunate.

00:48:18.592 --> 00:48:22.918
FELICIA: It is, really. Do you want to talk about
it, because I could use some advice.

00:48:22.918 --> 00:48:27.770
SAM: We can have some girl talk later, but right
now, focus on the dragon.

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:30.123
LAURA: Zahra, what about you, do you know about
dragons?

00:48:30.267 --> 00:48:32.855
MARY: I don't know where the dragons are, but--
I'm so sorry. I do not mean to interrupt-- but I

00:48:32.855 --> 00:48:41.899
can use Beast Speech, so if we come close to
anything, I could ask, potentially, to understand.

00:48:41.899 --> 00:48:43.717
Maybe get an idea, or--

00:48:43.717 --> 00:48:47.633
FELICIA: There may be somebody at the Abundant
Terrace who might know something about the woods

00:48:47.679 --> 00:48:51.799
and direction. That might be a good place to
start. It's a section of town where they

00:48:51.799 --> 00:48:57.382
concentrate on-- yes. So we can go there.

00:48:57.382 --> 00:48:59.500
LAURA: All right, let's do that.

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.064
TRAVIS: Let's go there. Please, god.

00:49:02.064 --> 00:49:08.643
MATT: All right, so in following Lyra towards the
Abundant Terrace, which is on the western side of

00:49:08.643 --> 00:49:13.238
town. This area is very different in visual style.
As soon as you approach this small hill that leads

00:49:13.238 --> 00:49:19.440
into the terrace proper, it is almost entirely
farmland. In this strange, harsh environment there

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:24.802
is something about this entire district that is
structured to be the source of vegetation and

00:49:24.802 --> 00:49:29.673
crops, and to be essentially feeding a large
portion of the population here. You also see there

00:49:29.673 --> 00:49:37.913
are a series of small temple towers and statues
that are focused around a particular deity. I

00:49:37.913 --> 00:49:41.522
want you guys to go ahead and 
roll religion real fast.

00:49:41.571 --> 00:49:44.845
LAURA: Roll a d20, and add your religion.

00:49:44.845 --> 00:49:48.816
MARY: Starting off well.

00:49:48.816 --> 00:49:52.511
LAURA: Great first roll.

00:49:52.511 --> 00:49:55.029
FELICIA: That roll is not good.

00:49:55.029 --> 00:49:56.208
SAM: 23.

00:49:56.208 --> 00:49:57.364
TALIESIN: 22.

00:49:57.364 --> 00:50:01.259
MATT: Which, you know this information. But before
you can even say it, as you are eager to mention,

00:50:01.259 --> 00:50:07.296
you sense that there is worship of Melora here.
Melora which is considered the goddess of

00:50:07.296 --> 00:50:14.006
wilderness and the sea and is one of the five--
soon to be six if Pike's temple raises-- deities

00:50:14.006 --> 00:50:21.453
that essentially rule the belief system and
lifestyle of the city of Vasselheim. So through

00:50:21.453 --> 00:50:27.673
the blessing and touch of Melora in this district
they are able to treat the land as magically

00:50:27.673 --> 00:50:35.802
fertile territory to grow. You gather upon
stepping inside that there's a cluster of dirty

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:43.299
looking, but very, very cluttered and busy
taverns, inns and general stores, like the entire

00:50:43.477 --> 00:50:51.568
portion of the district that isn't farmland is
jammed into this one little corner. Go ahead and

00:50:51.705 --> 00:50:56.713
make an investigation check.

00:50:56.713 --> 00:50:59.225
TRAVIS: Six.

00:50:59.225 --> 00:51:00.225
FELICIA: 21.

00:51:00.225 --> 00:51:01.276
SAM: 22.

00:51:01.276 --> 00:51:02.525
LAURA: 20.

00:51:02.525 --> 00:51:04.977
MATT: Percy?

00:51:04.977 --> 00:51:05.989
TALIESIN: 17.

00:51:05.989 --> 00:51:07.657
MARY: 17.

00:51:07.657 --> 00:51:13.279
MATT: 17, all right. You guys split up a bit
briefly to try and find more information. One of

00:51:13.279 --> 00:51:19.936
the groups that coalesces is Vex, Scanlan, and
Lyra. The three of you come upon a place called

00:51:19.936 --> 00:51:25.006
The Midnight Breath Tavern. You step inside and
speak for a bit and eventually you meet the

00:51:25.006 --> 00:51:34.649
co-owner, a gentleman named Dagon, who is an older
human who has what looks like a reddish, but

00:51:34.649 --> 00:51:39.519
somewhat patchy red and brown beard, a couple
scars on his body, but nothing battle worn-- more

00:51:39.519 --> 00:51:43.486
just a person who has existed in this harsh
landscape for a while. You guys are asking around

00:51:43.634 --> 00:51:48.560
and talking about dragons, mentioning dragons, and
somebody points in his direction and says, "Ah,

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:53.820
"dragon. You're gonna want to talk to Dagon about
that. He's the one who sees dragons."

00:51:54.009 --> 00:51:55.131
LAURA: Sees them?

00:51:55.131 --> 00:51:56.703
SAM: Let's go.

00:51:56.703 --> 00:51:58.246
FELICIA: That's nice.

00:51:58.292 --> 00:51:59.716
TRAVIS: I walk over to Dagon--

00:51:59.716 --> 00:52:01.123
SAM: You're not with us, are you?

00:52:01.123 --> 00:52:01.956
MARY: No.

00:52:01.956 --> 00:52:02.830
TRAVIS: What?

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:03.816
LAURA: You're not with us.

00:52:03.816 --> 00:52:05.396
TALIESIN: You're with me. We're still wandering
about like idiots.

00:52:05.396 --> 00:52:06.658
MATT: You guys are wandering about.

00:52:06.658 --> 00:52:07.658
MARY: Are we outside?

00:52:07.658 --> 00:52:09.288
MATT: You guys are in the process of asking
around. You'll meet up

00:52:09.288 --> 00:52:10.773
with them in just a moment.

00:52:10.773 --> 00:52:13.650
FELICIA: Vex, you're very attractive. Use your
wiles.

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:15.092
LAURA: Oh, thank you.

00:52:15.092 --> 00:52:18.226
SAM: Her wiles kill.

00:52:18.226 --> 00:52:21.402
LAURA: Dagon, is that your name?

00:52:21.402 --> 00:52:26.970
MATT: "That's my name." He's cleaning a glass.

00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:31.161
LAURA: I've heard many things about your knowledge
of dragons.

00:52:31.161 --> 00:52:32.463
MATT: "Correct."

00:52:32.463 --> 00:52:33.664
LAURA: Yes.

00:52:33.664 --> 00:52:35.249
MATT: "Y--You've seen it? You've seen the
dragon?"

00:52:35.249 --> 00:52:37.356
LAURA: I have seen dragons, and they suck.

00:52:37.356 --> 00:52:41.008
MATT: You hear a couple of snickers down the bar
and he goes, "Shut the hell up!"

00:52:41.008 --> 00:52:43.460
LAURA: Unless you like them. Do you like them?

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:50.413
MATT: "No, no one around here likes a dragon
proper. At least, none that I've come across. No,

00:52:50.413 --> 00:52:57.875
"I swears it. I swears it. I saw this one. I was up
north, about two days' travel northwest of here via

00:52:57.875 --> 00:53:00.652
"the Glasswalk Road. That's two days' travel
horseback, mind you."

00:53:00.652 --> 00:53:02.083
LAURA: The Glasswalk...? The Glasswalk... Road?

00:53:02.083 --> 00:53:03.206
MATT: "The Glasswalk Road, yeah."

00:53:03.206 --> 00:53:04.211
LAURA: Yes, of course.

00:53:04.211 --> 00:53:08.002
MATT: "I was heading to Muldire to, you know, visit
my brother and some of my family lives up in that

00:53:08.002 --> 00:53:15.221
"northern area. It's freezing cold, too chilly for
my tastes but-- I was going to visit and no more

00:53:15.221 --> 00:53:21.014
"than two days up there, a nasty blizzard blows in
out of nowhere, just starts wrecking the entire

00:53:21.014 --> 00:53:24.554
"roadside, slick with ice. We decide to go ahead
and make camp, me and a couple of the others who

00:53:24.554 --> 00:53:29.969
"were journeying with me. We head off the road, set
up a small camp, throw up some tents, and

00:53:29.969 --> 00:53:34.718
"thankfully, at least within the canopy of the
forest, it's easy enough to escape the barrage of

00:53:34.718 --> 00:53:40.196
"the elements, but it was a very, very cold night.
Our fire began to go out,

00:53:40.196 --> 00:53:41.769
"and we were a little worried."

00:53:41.769 --> 00:53:43.153
LAURA: And then there was a dragon?

00:53:43.153 --> 00:53:44.569
SAM: Yeah, get to the dragon. I'm sorry.

00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:46.209
MATT: "Hold on, let me tell my story."

00:53:46.209 --> 00:53:47.478
FELICIA: That was very rude. I am so sorry.

00:53:47.478 --> 00:53:48.828
SAM: I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

00:53:48.828 --> 00:53:52.191
MATT: "It's all right, I'm used to it." And a
voice over there says, "Yeah, he is!"

00:53:52.191 --> 00:53:54.386
"You. I will kick you out. I will kick you--"

00:53:54.386 --> 00:53:57.548
LAURA: I believe that you saw a dragon and I
believe that it was white because you were in a

00:53:57.548 --> 00:53:59.395
blizzard. Right? Am I right?

00:53:59.395 --> 00:54:04.260
MATT: "I'll get to that. Patience. Now, we're
sitting there--" And you get the feeling around

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:09.263
you that, there's like eight other people in
this tavern who are all face in their hands, like

00:54:09.263 --> 00:54:12.934
this story has probably been told dozens of times.
Over and over again.

00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:19.369
"So partway into the night, we're trying to keep
warm when suddenly we hear this terrifying roar,

00:54:19.369 --> 00:54:25.316
"that streaks across the sky. We could hear it over
the blistering sound of the snow and sleet

00:54:25.316 --> 00:54:31.314
"battered against our tent. I rush outside to take
a look. Not sure what to find, but instead, I see

00:54:31.314 --> 00:54:36.521
"what looks like a pack of four dire wolves
converging on our camp. Large, nasty beasts--"

00:54:36.521 --> 00:54:38.682
LAURA: Very much like a worg, if you will.

00:54:38.682 --> 00:54:40.359
MATT: "Worg-like, a little larger, yes."

00:54:40.359 --> 00:54:44.718
FELICIA: How large? Do you want to tell-- How
large proportionally would you say the...? No?

00:54:44.718 --> 00:54:46.211
Okay, keep going.

00:54:46.211 --> 00:54:48.880
MATT: "Well, no. I mean, if you want to get into--
if you're talking worg versus dire wolf, worg is

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:51.072
"still pretty large. About a good three, four--"

00:54:51.072 --> 00:54:54.405
FELICIA: I know, I've seen one. You know what
happened with me? I got into the guild because...

00:54:54.457 --> 00:54:55.854
TRAVIS: Oh god, here we go.

00:54:55.854 --> 00:54:57.812
LAURA: Well. Actually. Dragon.

00:54:57.812 --> 00:55:05.816
MATT: "So, this pack of dire wolves are converging
on me. I myself am fearful, but I know that, if

00:55:05.816 --> 00:55:09.730
"I'm gonna make a stand, now is the time to do it.
So I reach over and draw my dagger, and prepare

00:55:09.730 --> 00:55:11.051
"myself to defend--"

00:55:11.051 --> 00:55:14.116
LAURA: That's a giant dagger, if I've ever seen
one.

00:55:14.116 --> 00:55:23.504
MATT: "Thank you." He re-sheathes it, a little
blush to his cheeks. "I prepared myself to accept

00:55:23.504 --> 00:55:28.935
"possible defeat at these terrifying beasts. Then a
secondary roar breaks out. This time not from

00:55:28.935 --> 00:55:38.341
"around, but above. Incoming, streaking out of the
clouds above, I see, believe me, a dragon.

00:55:38.341 --> 00:55:41.072
"Wing-span huge, claws and teeth gnashing--"

00:55:41.072 --> 00:55:44.840
LAURA: I would never have guessed that's where
that was going. White dragon?

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:50.544
MATT: "White as the snow that encased the skyline.
It streaks down and snatch! Takes one of the worgs

00:55:50.544 --> 00:55:56.904
"in its jaws. Lifts up the worg, screeching about
angrily. It throws it into the air, and from its

00:55:56.904 --> 00:56:02.363
"mouth cascades a blistering, freezing cascade of
ice and sleet.

00:56:02.363 --> 00:56:05.553
"The worg itself freezes in mid-air."

00:56:05.553 --> 00:56:06.638
LAURA: Whoa.

00:56:06.638 --> 00:56:10.907
MATT: "Before it can plummet, the creature then
closes its jaws, snatching down on that worg, and

00:56:10.907 --> 00:56:16.579
"biting it in two. Only one fell stroke. As the
pieces of ice clatter to the ground, the rest of

00:56:16.579 --> 00:56:20.163
"the worgs scatter. I believe that dragon saved our
lives that night."

00:56:20.163 --> 00:56:26.568
LAURA: That's great. How did you make it back,
without dying?

00:56:26.568 --> 00:56:31.687
MATT: "Well apparently the dragon had its fill and
the dire wolves went off. So we packed up and went

00:56:31.687 --> 00:56:33.616
"right on back. Never made it to Muldire."

00:56:33.616 --> 00:56:41.542
LAURA: Did the dragon keep flying in the direction
of the Glasswalk Road? Or did it go east or west?

00:56:41.542 --> 00:56:42.913
Or which way?

00:56:42.913 --> 00:56:46.354
MATT: "I have no idea, actually. We just ran. We
turned tail and got the hell out of there as fast

00:56:46.354 --> 00:56:47.447
"as we could."

00:56:47.447 --> 00:56:49.668
SAM: That was quite a story, quite a story.

00:56:49.668 --> 00:56:50.857
FELICIA: That was stirring.

00:56:50.857 --> 00:56:52.269
MATT: "You believe me? You believe me on this?!"

00:56:52.269 --> 00:56:53.445
LAURA: We believe you.

00:56:53.445 --> 00:56:57.481
SAM: Not only do we believe you, but we want to tell
others of this. In fact, I'm a bit of a performer.

00:56:57.529 --> 00:56:59.635
I may write a song about your exploits.

00:56:59.635 --> 00:57:00.621
MATT: "Could you?"

00:57:00.621 --> 00:57:04.813
LAURA: Actually, could I roll for perception or
insight to see if he's

00:57:04.813 --> 00:57:06.354
telling the truth on everything?

00:57:06.354 --> 00:57:08.734
MATT: Go ahead and roll insight.

00:57:08.734 --> 00:57:12.870
SAM: Roll! Two.

00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:16.246
LAURA: Oh yeah, two. No, 17.

00:57:16.292 --> 00:57:17.478
MATT: 17.

00:57:17.478 --> 00:57:19.828
LAURA: No, is that a 17 or an 11?

00:57:19.828 --> 00:57:20.686
TRAVIS: 11.

00:57:20.686 --> 00:57:21.602
MARY: That's 11.

00:57:21.602 --> 00:57:22.478
LAURA: 17.

00:57:22.478 --> 00:57:29.475
MATT: 17. All right. He's not the most complicated
man. So, reading his intent is easier than a lot

00:57:29.475 --> 00:57:35.080
of individuals you've had to keep an eye on
previously. He is eager to tell the story and is

00:57:35.127 --> 00:57:42.080
in full belief. The frustration, and the only
things that detract from his child-like excitement

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.989
at telling this tale, is his moments of side
looking frustration to the other members of the

00:57:45.989 --> 00:57:52.862
tavern that do not take him seriously, it seems.
Dagon does seem to be truthful in, at least,

00:57:52.862 --> 00:57:54.670
believing what he is saying to you.

00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:58.313
FELICIA: Thank you so much for your information-- I
take a gold coin and I'm just like, is this

00:57:58.313 --> 00:58:02.363
enough? Yes, that's good. Thank you. So we-- we'll
be going. Yeah?

00:58:02.427 --> 00:58:07.143
LAURA: Can I perception and see how heavy that bag
of gold actually looks? I just want to know.

00:58:07.143 --> 00:58:09.246
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:58:09.246 --> 00:58:15.620
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to roll the gold dice. 24.

00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:27.471
MATT: 24. As she reaches into the pouch-- there is
a rather large, visibly bulging pouch to her side

00:58:27.471 --> 00:58:31.252
that is, in no way shape or form, even attempting
to be covertly hidden.

00:58:31.252 --> 00:58:34.772
SAM: She's got a Scrooge McDuck bag?

00:58:34.772 --> 00:58:36.436
(laughter)

00:58:36.436 --> 00:58:38.592
MATT: Seemingly.

00:58:38.592 --> 00:58:43.263
MARY: Does it make her limp? So sorry.

00:58:43.263 --> 00:58:47.686
FELICIA: Oh goodness. Guys. We are going to have
to get some warm clothing. It seems like that. So

00:58:47.686 --> 00:58:48.986
let's go shopping.

00:58:48.986 --> 00:58:50.135
LAURA: I love this plan.

00:58:50.135 --> 00:58:51.139
TRAVIS: Oh God.

00:58:51.139 --> 00:58:52.319
SAM: Dagon. Dagon?

00:58:52.319 --> 00:58:53.858
MATT: "It is! Dagon. Remember the name Dagon for
your song."

00:58:53.858 --> 00:58:55.915
SAM: I will definitely write a song for you.

00:58:55.915 --> 00:58:57.172
MATT: "I can write it down for you."

00:58:57.172 --> 00:59:03.480
SAM: No, I can remember that. Will we have any
trouble finding this place? Will we need a guide?

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:06.738
Someone who's possibly been there before? Would
that make the journey--

00:59:06.738 --> 00:59:12.519
MATT: "Oh, I ain't going back! Y'all's crazy if
you're going back there. I would say just look for

00:59:12.519 --> 00:59:15.773
"where the blizzard is coming from. That seemed to
be the harbinger of the beast."

00:59:15.773 --> 00:59:17.316
LAURA: Go to the blizzard.

00:59:17.316 --> 00:59:19.286
TRAVIS: Two days on horseback, or two days
walking?

00:59:19.286 --> 00:59:21.540
MATT: "Two days on horseback. Up the Glasswalk."

00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:25.230
FELICIA: Oh my gosh, we'll have to get horses,
too. Well, let's go.

00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:29.011
LAURA: Does the guild give you money for..?

00:59:29.011 --> 00:59:30.785
FELICIA: Um.

00:59:30.785 --> 00:59:36.591
MATT: As far as you know, horses are provided to
full-fledged hunting members. You got the feeling,

00:59:36.591 --> 00:59:41.209
in your very, very brief preparation for this,
that part of the test was to secure your own

00:59:41.209 --> 00:59:42.508
transportation.

00:59:42.508 --> 00:59:43.438
LAURA: Lovely.

00:59:43.438 --> 00:59:49.773
FELICIA: I think we are on our own. I mean, I
think it's part of our perseverance to prove that

00:59:49.773 --> 00:59:53.146
we are worthy of being-- I mean I am in the guild,
just to be clear.

00:59:53.146 --> 00:59:54.531
SAM: You're a member?

00:59:54.531 --> 00:59:58.049
FELICIA: We are just going to have to-- Yes, I am
a member. Did you hear how I got in? It is really

00:59:58.049 --> 00:59:59.138
a fascinating story.

00:59:59.138 --> 01:00:00.552
SAM: No, I heard it was sort of a technicality.

01:00:00.552 --> 01:00:01.595
FELICIA: Oh, well it was but--

01:00:01.595 --> 01:00:03.202
SAM: I can't wait to hear it.

01:00:03.202 --> 01:00:04.757
FELICIA: Maybe around the campfire!

01:00:04.757 --> 01:00:05.718
SAM: Yes.

01:00:05.718 --> 01:00:07.016
FELICIA: You could sing!

01:00:07.016 --> 01:00:13.032
SAM: I could, if you told me the details. You know
what, I do forget a lot. Maybe you could just

01:00:13.097 --> 01:00:16.038
write them down quietly to yourself and just give
me a note later.

01:00:16.038 --> 01:00:19.056
FELICIA: Okay, as long as it's a love story
between me and Aldor-- I'll tell you how to spell

01:00:19.056 --> 01:00:21.280
it. Okay! Well, let's go meet the rest of the
group!

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.579
SAM: Thank you, Dagon.

01:00:22.579 --> 01:00:26.673
LAURA: As we're leaving, I walk up behind Lyra and
I put my hand on her shoulder, and then I reach

01:00:26.673 --> 01:00:32.536
down and grab her bag of gold and I (clears
throat) and look down to it and say, you might

01:00:32.536 --> 01:00:37.283
want to keep a better eye on this, darling. There
are very very nasty people around.

01:00:37.283 --> 01:00:38.695
FELICIA: Oh my goodness.

01:00:38.695 --> 01:00:40.591
SAM: You're traveling with some of them.

01:00:40.591 --> 01:00:43.363
LAURA: I didn't take anything, I'm simply letting
you know.

01:00:43.363 --> 01:00:46.791
FELICIA: That is so nice of you! I'm going to buy
you the prettiest cloak as thanks.

01:00:46.791 --> 01:00:50.210
LAURA: Thank you so much, darling. You have lovely
eyes.

01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:54.517
FELICIA: Thank you! I've never had a friend
before! This is so great!

01:00:54.517 --> 01:00:57.373
LAURA: Maybe when we shop you can tell me all
about Aldor.

01:00:57.373 --> 01:01:01.133
FELICIA: Oh my gosh, he is so handsome.

01:01:01.133 --> 01:01:05.718
MATT: As you guys step out of the tavern, you walk
up to the other members of your party: Zahra, Grog

01:01:05.718 --> 01:01:06.956
and Percy.

01:01:06.956 --> 01:01:08.089
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god.

01:01:08.089 --> 01:01:09.586
MARY: What have you discovered?

01:01:09.586 --> 01:01:11.176
SAM: Northwest. Cold.

01:01:11.176 --> 01:01:12.045
LAURA: Blizzards.

01:01:12.045 --> 01:01:13.394
SAM: Dragon. Blizzard.

01:01:13.394 --> 01:01:14.393
LAURA: It ices things.

01:01:14.393 --> 01:01:15.749
SAM: Two days. We need horses.

01:01:15.749 --> 01:01:16.627
MARY: Two days?

01:01:16.627 --> 01:01:19.164
LAURA: We'll definitely need some sort of
protection against ice attacks.

01:01:19.164 --> 01:01:20.081
MARY: Right.

01:01:20.081 --> 01:01:23.931
TRAVIS: I have a question. I'm not good with
numbers, but it's a two days' journey there? And a

01:01:23.931 --> 01:01:25.340
two days' journey back?

01:01:25.394 --> 01:01:26.356
LAURA: Yeah.

01:01:26.356 --> 01:01:27.528
TALIESIN: We do have an airship.

01:01:27.528 --> 01:01:29.646
TRAVIS: Is that four, and we have three days to do
this in?

01:01:29.646 --> 01:01:30.866
TALIESIN: Don't we have an airship?

01:01:30.866 --> 01:01:33.008
LAURA: How are we going to do that exactly?

01:01:33.008 --> 01:01:35.043
TRAVIS: I mean, I'm not the brightest in the
bunch, but.

01:01:35.043 --> 01:01:39.863
MATT: You know that contracts are complete upon
the quarry being slain.

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:41.297
ALL: Oh!

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:46.039
FELICIA: We have three days to get home. It's
hard. You were reading it a little bit fast

01:01:46.039 --> 01:01:48.192
MARY: Two days to get there and one day to slay
it?

01:01:48.192 --> 01:01:49.313
LAURA: Thereabouts, yes.

01:01:49.313 --> 01:01:50.661
MARY: Is that about it?

01:01:50.661 --> 01:01:54.974
MATT: Once the creature is actually slain, and the
pieces are harvested, then the contract is

01:01:54.974 --> 01:01:57.195
completed. Then you can take your time returning.

01:01:57.195 --> 01:01:58.345
TRAVIS: Thank God.

01:01:58.345 --> 01:02:00.722
MARY: Great. We can ride it down the mountain.

01:02:00.722 --> 01:02:01.622
TRAVIS: Really?

01:02:01.622 --> 01:02:02.635
MARY: No.

01:02:02.635 --> 01:02:04.658
SAM: We need to get some horses up in this joint?

01:02:04.658 --> 01:02:06.765
FELICIA: We need horses, we need cloaks, we need
furs, wools...

01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:12.500
LAURA: We definitely need warm things. Actually, I
have warm cloaks for the party and half of our

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.871
party isn't here so we can have them.

01:02:14.871 --> 01:02:18.650
SAM: Will you need some cold weather clothes,
Zahra?

01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:20.879
MARY: I believe, it would be nice.

01:02:20.879 --> 01:02:23.104
SAM: And Lyra did you bring anything?

01:02:23.104 --> 01:02:25.332
FELICIA: Well I can go by my uncle's house and get
pretty much anything.

01:02:25.332 --> 01:02:27.420
SAM: Yeah? Oh wait! Would he have enough for us?

01:02:27.436 --> 01:02:31.607
FELICIA: Oh! Well goodness he's a trade ambassador
to here. It's funny. We have a lot of warehouses.

01:02:31.607 --> 01:02:32.844
It's so funny.

01:02:32.844 --> 01:02:34.033
SAM: Let's go do that!

01:02:34.033 --> 01:02:37.931
LAURA: Seriously? Wait, so does he give discounts
to family members?

01:02:37.977 --> 01:02:43.645
FELICIA: Oh I can just, you know. I can persuade
him to-- because he's nice and--

01:02:43.645 --> 01:02:45.590
LAURA: Lyra, I think we're going to be best
friends!

01:02:45.590 --> 01:02:46.876
SAM: Way to bury the lede!

01:02:46.876 --> 01:02:48.352
MARY: Lyra, does he have access to horses?

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.712
FELICIA: Um. I don't--

01:02:49.712 --> 01:02:54.244
MATT: You haven't ever had any sort of discussions
with him in regards to horses. You know there are

01:02:54.244 --> 01:02:57.052
a few liveries throughout town, but you don't
think you have any family ties to them directly.

01:02:57.052 --> 01:03:02.561
FELICIA: Not directly. I mean, it's trade more
than that, but I know some places.

01:03:02.561 --> 01:03:04.101
SAM: Is this your Uncle Randy?

01:03:04.101 --> 01:03:05.917
FELICIA: Uncle Randy! Yes, you know about him?

01:03:05.917 --> 01:03:08.748
SAM: He's legend. His legend has been sung far and
wide.

01:03:08.748 --> 01:03:12.448
FELICIA: He's so fantastic. He's so kind-hearted.
He took me in when I was-- anyway we'll talk about

01:03:12.448 --> 01:03:15.082
it over fire camps!

01:03:15.082 --> 01:03:16.258
TALIESIN: Come on, everybody.

01:03:16.258 --> 01:03:19.038
LAURA: So can we find horses in the area?

01:03:19.038 --> 01:03:24.533
MATT: You briefly look about and you find a livery
not too far from the outskirts of this district.

01:03:24.533 --> 01:03:31.743
As you enter, the gentleman who runs it there is
eager, "Have you come to buy some horses? Well,

01:03:31.743 --> 01:03:33.129
"certainly."

01:03:33.129 --> 01:03:35.580
SAM: Rent them. Let's rent them for a week.

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:39.482
MATT: "The thing about renting is, in this area if
you're riding out with horses, a lot of them don't

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:40.771
"make their way back."

01:03:40.771 --> 01:03:43.948
LAURA: How about we rent them, and if they don't
make their way back we'll pay you the difference?

01:03:43.948 --> 01:03:45.459
SAM: We'll leave you a hefty deposit.

01:03:45.459 --> 01:03:50.248
MATT: "That could possibly work, yes."

01:03:50.248 --> 01:03:53.079
MARY: May I cast Suggestion?

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:54.508
LAURA: Oh, try it. Do it!

01:03:54.508 --> 01:03:57.508
MARY: Are you all right? Am I all right to--

01:03:57.508 --> 01:03:58.622
SAM: Go for it.

01:03:58.622 --> 01:04:00.302
MARY: I cast Suggestion.

01:04:00.302 --> 01:04:04.061
MATT: Okay, so while you guys are in this
conversation, you stay back and make a few symbols

01:04:04.061 --> 01:04:08.246
with your fingers, whispering under your breath,
you complete the Suggestion spell. What's the DC

01:04:08.246 --> 01:04:14.539
of your spell? It should be on the top of your
spell page. The top of your actual sheet that has

01:04:14.539 --> 01:04:16.056
all your things listed.

01:04:16.056 --> 01:04:17.956
LAURA: DC 17.

01:04:18.007 --> 01:04:21.434
MATT: All right. What do you want to suggest?

01:04:21.434 --> 01:04:31.177
MARY: You shall lend us the horses, knowing that
we shall take very good care of them. We may keep

01:04:31.177 --> 01:04:33.768
them for as long as we like.

01:04:33.768 --> 01:04:38.669
MATT: As you're having this conversation he looks
over at the group and goes, "You know what? You

01:04:38.669 --> 01:04:46.469
"all look like a very trustworthy group. I wouldn't
wanna breed any sort of ill will for future

01:04:46.469 --> 01:04:47.523
"business."

01:04:47.523 --> 01:04:49.795
LAURA: Right. I mean, Uncle Randy after all.

01:04:49.795 --> 01:04:54.427
MATT: "Tell you what. I'll give you the horses,
rental, half price. I trust you'll bring 'em back.

01:04:54.427 --> 01:04:59.777
"Don't worry about any sort of deposit. I believe
you're trustworthy folk."

01:04:59.777 --> 01:05:01.213
SAM: Wow. Thank you, sir!

01:05:01.213 --> 01:05:02.116
LAURA: That's lovely.

01:05:02.116 --> 01:05:09.049
MATT: "So for six horses, we're look for a rental
price of around... Say, 50 gold for the lot, rental."

01:05:09.095 --> 01:05:10.327
TRAVIS: Done!

01:05:10.327 --> 01:05:11.609
LAURA: Wait, well--

01:05:11.609 --> 01:05:14.095
SAM: We can save a little if I shared a horse with
you.

01:05:14.095 --> 01:05:19.005
FELICIA: Oh. Wha-- no. No, I'd rather have my own
horse. Thank you.

01:05:19.005 --> 01:05:19.966
SAM: Okay.

01:05:19.966 --> 01:05:21.658
LAURA: You can ride with me, Scanlan.

01:05:21.658 --> 01:05:22.758
SAM: No, thanks.

01:05:22.758 --> 01:05:24.879
(laughter)

01:05:24.879 --> 01:05:26.762
LAURA: But, Trinket--

01:05:26.762 --> 01:05:28.655
TRAVIS: Shut down!

01:05:28.655 --> 01:05:30.728
LAURA: Does he ride-- is he as fast as a horse?

01:05:30.924 --> 01:05:35.344
MATT: (chuckles) Trinket would probably be
struggling to keep up with you guys.

01:05:35.344 --> 01:05:36.791
LAURA: Well, how--

01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:37.766
SAM: Should we leave Trinket?

01:05:37.766 --> 01:05:38.518
LAURA: No!

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:39.933
SAM: I always want to leave Trinket!

01:05:39.933 --> 01:05:41.752
LAURA: Why do you always wanna leave my wonderful
bear?!

01:05:41.752 --> 01:05:44.550
SAM: Because he only almost dies every time.

01:05:44.550 --> 01:05:48.366
LAURA: I know, he almost dies every time I put him
in battle. It's ridiculous.

01:05:48.366 --> 01:05:50.318
FELICIA: I think he's adorable, and it would be 
really nice to have him along.

01:05:50.318 --> 01:05:51.967
LAURA: He is adorable, isn't he?

01:05:51.967 --> 01:05:54.816
FELICIA: You guys, it's so beautiful to see
the friendship that you have. If I had that with

01:05:54.876 --> 01:05:56.539
another person-- say, Aldor-- it would be--

01:05:56.539 --> 01:05:57.519
SAM: Aldor is--

01:05:57.519 --> 01:06:01.398
TRAVIS: Oh God. Do you have any Clydesdales or
giant horses for me?

01:06:01.543 --> 01:06:03.241
TALIESIN: Have you thought of getting a cat, by
any chance?

01:06:03.241 --> 01:06:04.015
FELICIA: Hm?

01:06:04.015 --> 01:06:05.364
TALIESIN: Just a suggestion. I don't know.

01:06:05.364 --> 01:06:09.822
MATT: "I think we could... probably facilitate. I
can't say that it'll have much of a shelf life,

01:06:09.822 --> 01:06:11.913
"depending on how much you ride it, but--"

01:06:11.913 --> 01:06:13.532
TRAVIS: That's what people say about me. That's
fine.

01:06:13.532 --> 01:06:17.803
MATT: He pulls out a very, very nice looking
warhorse that looks like it's designed to carry

01:06:17.803 --> 01:06:21.174
very heavy soldiers. Still unproven as to whether
or not it will be able to carry you,

01:06:21.174 --> 01:06:22.103
but we shall see.

01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:23.054
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:06:23.054 --> 01:06:26.343
MATT: And once again, the horse travel wasn't two
days of straight gallop. It was--

01:06:26.343 --> 01:06:27.190
LAURA: Oh! Okay.

01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:31.057
MATT: A casual trot, in which Trinket could
probably keep up, but you guys might have to take

01:06:31.057 --> 01:06:32.913
a break every now and then, because he's still a
bear.

01:06:32.913 --> 01:06:34.916
LAURA: Okay. Well, it's doable.

01:06:34.916 --> 01:06:36.370
TRAVIS: Make him earn it!

01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:37.823
TALIESIN: At the bear-est mean.

01:06:37.823 --> 01:06:38.817
MATT: Oh.

01:06:38.817 --> 01:06:41.289
TALIESIN: I've got, like, five more. I've been
saving them up for this entire game.

01:06:41.289 --> 01:06:43.005
SAM: I missed...

01:06:43.005 --> 01:06:45.544
TALIESIN: Nothing. No-- it's nothing.

01:06:45.544 --> 01:06:46.697
TRAVIS: Oh, puns yeah.

01:06:46.697 --> 01:06:48.604
MATT: For every bear pun that happens, an angel
loses its wings.

01:06:48.604 --> 01:06:49.742
MARY: So do we give you our gold and--

01:06:49.742 --> 01:06:51.037
SAM: Yes, yes. Here's our gold.

01:06:51.037 --> 01:06:52.407
MATT: Certainly, certainly! I'll get you your
horses.

01:06:52.407 --> 01:06:54.036
LAURA: Wait, who's-- who's paying?

01:06:54.036 --> 01:06:55.089
TRAVIS: The party is.

01:06:55.089 --> 01:06:56.633
LAURA: But it-- half our party isn't here, so--

01:06:56.633 --> 01:06:57.522
TRAVIS: Vex.

01:06:57.522 --> 01:06:58.951
FELICIA: I'll just-- Don't, don't-- I'll just do
it!

01:06:58.951 --> 01:06:59.823
SAM: Oh, thank you!

01:06:59.823 --> 01:07:01.972
FELICIA: There you go. Thank you! Bye-bye, nice to
meet you!

01:07:01.972 --> 01:07:02.960
MATT: "Thank you kindly."

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.460
TALIESIN: Oh! You're so kind! That's excellent.

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:05.538
TRAVIS: Thanks, Lyra

01:07:05.538 --> 01:07:07.269
MARY: Well done, Lyra. Very good.

01:07:07.269 --> 01:07:12.848
FELICIA: Now, I need to talk with you. Can-- can
we go out? Are we leaving yet?

01:07:12.848 --> 01:07:13.967
(laughter)

01:07:13.967 --> 01:07:19.156
MATT: Yes. The stable boy is bringing the horses
over, the rest of you begin like putting your

01:07:19.156 --> 01:07:23.399
materials up and strapping them to the saddles.
And what did you want to do?

01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:27.000
FELICIA: Listen, missy. I am a leader of this, and
the fact that you pulled out a spell and did not

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.369
say-- and it is just-- it's just not even the way
I want to conduct my team. So. You. If you're

01:07:32.369 --> 01:07:36.485
going to use underhanded tactics you need to clear
them with me first because I am the leader.

01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:39.736
MARY: My spellcasting is actually overhand,
but...

01:07:39.736 --> 01:07:41.639
FELICIA: Wha--?

01:07:41.639 --> 01:07:45.328
MARY: I understand. And I shall keep that in mind,
and I do apologize.

01:07:45.379 --> 01:07:46.618
FELICIA: Really?

01:07:46.618 --> 01:07:53.174
MARY: Yes, I apologize very deeply. Very, very
sincerely.

01:07:53.174 --> 01:07:54.829
FELICIA: I was just a leader! I did it.

01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:55.990
TALIESIN: Oh, well done!

01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:58.352
FELICIA: Yay! We're going to have a great
journey!

01:07:58.352 --> 01:08:00.816
SAM: That was impressive. You put her in her
place.

01:08:00.816 --> 01:08:01.672
FELICIA: I did!

01:08:01.672 --> 01:08:02.984
SAM: Asserted yourself, but you were--

01:08:02.984 --> 01:08:03.982
FELICIA: Firm, but polite, right?

01:08:03.982 --> 01:08:04.872
TALIESIN: You were firm, but fair.

01:08:04.872 --> 01:08:06.215
SAM: Firm, but fair. Yes.

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:09.430
LAURA: I am very, very nervous that somebody is
going to die when we fight this dragon.

01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:11.032
TRAVIS: Oh, I hope it's me.

01:08:11.032 --> 01:08:16.876
MATT: So. Horses ready and mounted up? You guys
gather all the rest of your materials, you ride up

01:08:16.876 --> 01:08:25.265
back through the Braving Grounds to the
northwestern exit to the outside wall.

01:08:25.265 --> 01:08:26.166
Anything else?

01:08:26.166 --> 01:08:30.068
LAURA: Ooh! So, protection against ice magic. Does
anybody have stuff that works for that?

01:08:30.068 --> 01:08:31.633
SAM: Didn't we need to go to Uncle Randy's?

01:08:31.633 --> 01:08:32.765
LAURA: Lyra do you know any--

01:08:32.765 --> 01:08:34.534
FELICIA: Well, we were going to go and get
some...

01:08:34.534 --> 01:08:35.341
MATT: That's right.

01:08:35.341 --> 01:08:38.039
FELICIA: Yeah, we're going to go to the warehouse
that's on the edge of the district.

01:08:38.039 --> 01:08:38.884
MATT: Okay.

01:08:38.884 --> 01:08:41.512
FELICIA: Where we're going, we're going to get
some furs and all that sort of stuff.

01:08:41.512 --> 01:08:46.064
MATT: Easy enough. You guys follow Lyra down to
the outside of the Quadroads. There is one

01:08:46.064 --> 01:08:50.761
warehouse she goes to, she knocks on the door and
as it opens up, you can see a rather comely

01:08:50.761 --> 01:09:01.291
looking gentleman with a nice soft, almost a
purple-blue beret. Little bit of a heavyset neck

01:09:01.291 --> 01:09:07.412
bulge that rests over the top of his little
doublet. And he opens it and he looks up. "Eh,

01:09:07.412 --> 01:09:09.628
what can I-- oh Lyra."

01:09:09.628 --> 01:09:12.519
FELICIA: Hi! Oh my gosh. How are you?!

01:09:12.519 --> 01:09:14.969
MATT: (groans) "What do you want this time?"

01:09:14.969 --> 01:09:19.704
FELICIA: Well, it's funny. Because I finally got
an assignment with the guild! Can you believe it?

01:09:19.752 --> 01:09:21.813
It's like whoa! Uncle Randy's going to be so--

01:09:21.813 --> 01:09:23.157
MATT: "No, I can't believe it."

01:09:23.157 --> 01:09:24.292
FELICIA: Oh. Really?

01:09:24.292 --> 01:09:25.753
MATT: "But good for you."

01:09:25.753 --> 01:09:28.417
FELICIA: Thank you! So anyway, me and my friends--
these are my friends now.

01:09:28.417 --> 01:09:30.396
SAM: You know what? She's sort of our leader.

01:09:30.396 --> 01:09:31.405
TALIESIN: Hello.

01:09:31.405 --> 01:09:32.842
SAM: If you must know, Randy.

01:09:32.842 --> 01:09:33.929
FELICIA: Right?!

01:09:33.929 --> 01:09:41.617
MATT: He gives a very, very long, judgmental,
mistrusting look across all five of you.

01:09:41.617 --> 01:09:43.433
LAURA: Should we call you uncle?

01:09:43.433 --> 01:09:45.642
MATT: "Please, don't."

01:09:45.642 --> 01:09:47.912
(laughter)

01:09:47.912 --> 01:09:51.173
SAM: You know what, Mister Randy? We had our
doubts about your--

01:09:51.173 --> 01:09:54.973
FELICIA: Oh, no that's not-- No no no no, he's not
my uncle. No-- my uncle is not here, he's just--

01:09:54.973 --> 01:09:56.459
this is just one of his--

01:09:56.522 --> 01:09:57.534
LAURA: Oh!

01:09:57.534 --> 01:09:59.229
FELICIA: Managers. Yeah, very important.

01:09:59.229 --> 01:10:00.248
SAM: Oh, okay.

01:10:00.248 --> 01:10:03.098
FELICIA: He's going to be-- Uncle Randy is going
to eat his hat, isn't he? I got a leadership

01:10:03.098 --> 01:10:06.121
position! Anyway, can you help us out?

01:10:06.121 --> 01:10:07.863
MATT: "What do you need, Lyra?"

01:10:07.863 --> 01:10:10.420
FELICIA: We're going into the cold-- we're going
into a blizzard, can you believe that? And you

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:13.838
know how much I hate the cold, but we do need to
be provisioned, so what do we have in the crates

01:10:13.838 --> 01:10:15.098
that we can help...?

01:10:15.098 --> 01:10:16.665
MATT: He closes the door.

01:10:16.665 --> 01:10:20.845
(laughter)

01:10:20.845 --> 01:10:22.383
MATT: A minute goes by.

01:10:22.383 --> 01:10:23.144
SAM: Did you--

01:10:23.144 --> 01:10:24.087
LAURA: Um, I thought--

01:10:24.087 --> 01:10:25.144
MATT: Two minutes go by.

01:10:25.144 --> 01:10:26.643
FELICIA: Oh, he's going to hook us up. He's going
to hook us up, really.

01:10:26.643 --> 01:10:27.492
SAM: Really?

01:10:27.492 --> 01:10:29.196
FELICIA: Uh! (Knocks)

01:10:29.196 --> 01:10:38.218
MARY: I use Mask of Many Faces and I disguise
myself as Uncle Frank.

01:10:38.218 --> 01:10:39.420
LAURA: Uncle Randy?

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:40.591
MARY: Uncle Randy!

01:10:40.591 --> 01:10:41.607
(laughter)

01:10:41.607 --> 01:10:43.475
MARY: Frankly, my dear! I am Uncle Randy.

01:10:43.475 --> 01:10:45.156
TRAVIS: Bob? Peter?

01:10:45.156 --> 01:10:46.249
TALIESIN: Don't talk to Frank anymore.

01:10:46.249 --> 01:10:47.130
MATT: All right. You have not seen Uncle Randy.

01:10:47.130 --> 01:10:47.978
MARY: Oh, balls!

01:10:47.978 --> 01:10:49.020
MATT: Which is the only downside to that.

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:50.204
MARY: Balls and a half!

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:51.223
MATT: Um. You could--

01:10:51.223 --> 01:10:52.259
(laughter)

01:10:52.259 --> 01:10:54.001
MARY: There's no pictures on the wall anywhere I
could look at outside?

01:10:54.001 --> 01:10:55.118
SAM: Just go on Facebook. Facebook!

01:10:55.118 --> 01:10:59.214
MARY: A great big, beautiful... this is where he
sells things! Great.

01:10:59.214 --> 01:11:02.275
MATT: Unfortunately, no. But if there's any other
form you'd like to take you're welcome to.

01:11:02.275 --> 01:11:05.461
MARY: (whispers) Bollocks.

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:08.393
TALIESIN: Oh, bloody hell. I'm going to knock
loudly.

01:11:08.393 --> 01:11:11.722
FELICIA: Well, this is just very-- this is is a
very egg-on-face situation.

01:11:11.722 --> 01:11:14.192
TRAVIS: He's looking for stuff, right? He's--

01:11:14.192 --> 01:11:18.073
MATT: The door opens at this point, almost pushing
you back on your heels. You catch yourself as he

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:26.591
comes out carrying a large pile of what look like
relatively well-kept furs and thick leather

01:11:26.591 --> 01:11:34.596
cloaks, and shoves them into your arms. "Be safe,
little one." (bff) Closes the door.

01:11:34.596 --> 01:11:35.477
SAM: Bye.

01:11:35.477 --> 01:11:37.095
TALIESIN: We'll try to get her back in one piece.

01:11:37.095 --> 01:11:39.672
FELICIA: Thank you. That's sweet. See? I came
through, guys. I came through.

01:11:39.672 --> 01:11:40.694
TALIESIN and SAM: You did!

01:11:40.694 --> 01:11:42.054
FELICIA: Just remember, that I came through.

01:11:42.054 --> 01:11:45.499
SAM: We'll write a good comment card when we get
back.

01:11:45.499 --> 01:11:46.544
LAURA: Definitely.

01:11:46.544 --> 01:11:48.833
MARY: Can I get the one that's slit up the back so
my tail doesn't--

01:11:48.833 --> 01:11:55.383
SAM: All right, we're loaded up. We've got horses,
we've got healing potions, we've got--

01:11:55.383 --> 01:11:57.222
MARY: Loaded for bear, as it were.

01:11:57.222 --> 01:11:59.748
LAURA: We're great. Trinket's wonderful.

01:11:59.748 --> 01:12:00.910
MARY: Yes, he is!

01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:03.834
MATT: He nuzzles up alongside
Vex.

01:12:03.834 --> 01:12:05.571
SAM: Shall we set off?

01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:06.597
TRAVIS: Go? Yeah.

01:12:06.597 --> 01:12:07.669
MARY: Yes, let's do.

01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:10.094
SAM: Do you want to go, one more time to the
Braving Grounds, Grog, and just--

01:12:10.094 --> 01:12:10.900
LAURA: No.

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:12.414
SAM: Try your hand against-- no?

01:12:12.414 --> 01:12:15.732
TALIESIN: Why don't we slay the dragon first, and
then--

01:12:15.732 --> 01:12:16.675
LAURA: Yeah.

01:12:16.675 --> 01:12:18.054
TALIESIN: Then he can punch things.

01:12:18.054 --> 01:12:19.399
LAURA: Since we're on a time crunch, Scanlan.

01:12:19.399 --> 01:12:20.526
SAM: You're right. You're right, there is a--

01:12:20.526 --> 01:12:21.796
MARY: Everyone is good on weapons?

01:12:21.796 --> 01:12:22.797
LAURA: I'd say yes.

01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:27.019
TRAVIS: I haven't finished my training montage
yet. Got to run through the snow, got to do

01:12:27.019 --> 01:12:28.077
pullups on trees.

01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:29.448
MARY: (sings) Gonna need a montage.

01:12:29.448 --> 01:12:30.321
TRAVIS: Inverted sit-ups--

01:12:30.321 --> 01:12:31.834
MARY: (sings) Even Phillip had a--

01:12:31.834 --> 01:12:33.638
MARY and TRAVIS: (sings) Montage!

01:12:33.638 --> 01:12:36.105
SAM: All right, we go west along the Glass...
Hand... Road.

01:12:36.105 --> 01:12:37.569
TALIESIN: Glasswalk Road.

01:12:37.569 --> 01:12:42.255
MATT: You embark on the Glasswalk Road, which
forms right on the outskirts of the Braving

01:12:42.255 --> 01:12:47.758
Grounds. You are let through the front gates of
the outside of the Vesper Timberlands, and this is

01:12:47.758 --> 01:12:52.887
the first time you've actually seen a formal road
that is carved and at least traversed enough that

01:12:52.887 --> 01:12:57.164
the Timberland hasn't completely consumed it. You
can still see various tree roots and branches are

01:12:57.164 --> 01:13:03.538
progressively, almost angrily, pushing in towards
this gate, but you get the feeling based on the

01:13:03.538 --> 01:13:06.544
cuts that whoever goes through here-- at least
some people go through here, they keep it

01:13:06.544 --> 01:13:12.110
relatively well-kept for travel up north. You ride
out into it and the canopy almost completely

01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:24.187
encloses it, so it's like a tunnel of very dense
tree, vine, and leaf structure. You push forward

01:13:24.392 --> 01:13:31.378
out into the cold air and begin to ride for the
remainder of the day. A good eight or nine hours

01:13:31.378 --> 01:13:38.304
hit before the chill begins to grow. The sun
begins to find itself setting across the far

01:13:38.304 --> 01:13:42.884
mountains, and the forest around you grows darker
and darker still.

01:13:42.884 --> 01:13:45.443
LAURA: Probably need to make camp.

01:13:45.443 --> 01:13:48.491
FELICIA: I think we should make camp! 
I-- should we make camp? Yes! We should

01:13:48.491 --> 01:13:49.830
make camp!

01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:51.882
MARY: I shall take first watch.

01:13:51.882 --> 01:13:54.221
TRAVIS: I have a firewood bundle that we can make
a fire with.

01:13:54.221 --> 01:13:57.157
LAURA: There's also lots of wood around, Grog.

01:13:57.157 --> 01:13:58.016
MARY: Yes.

01:13:58.016 --> 01:14:03.154
TRAVIS: And I have an axe. Let's do that instead.
Can I find a really tiny tree and start hacking

01:14:03.154 --> 01:14:04.173
away at it?

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:05.243
SAM: Tiny?

01:14:05.243 --> 01:14:08.376
TRAVIS: Yeah, tiny. We don't need to kill, like,
Grandpa Tree. We kill Baby Tree.

01:14:08.376 --> 01:14:10.234
LAURA: Keyleth would be proud.

01:14:10.234 --> 01:14:12.983
TRAVIS: Don't-- how about don't tell Keyleth?

01:14:12.983 --> 01:14:14.532
LAURA: I miss my brother.

01:14:14.532 --> 01:14:20.712
MATT: Okay. You guys get off of the main road, as
that's probably not a very good area to be out in

01:14:20.712 --> 01:14:27.943
the open. You find, after about a five to ten
minute walk, a small opening and along the way you

01:14:27.943 --> 01:14:32.621
find a tree that looks viable. There's a small
slope of hill that heads up to an upper platform

01:14:32.621 --> 01:14:36.801
area maybe about five to ten feet up, and a small
opening that you think would be a fitting place to

01:14:36.801 --> 01:14:42.720
put a fire that wouldn't be in danger of setting
the nearby vegetation aflame. You go ahead and

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:46.371
start looking for firewood. Go ahead and make an
athletics roll.

01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:51.472
TRAVIS: 16.

01:14:51.472 --> 01:14:57.361
MATT: All right. After a good 15, 20 minute
period-- relatively brief for most folk-- you come

01:14:57.361 --> 01:15:01.824
back with a nice, hefty stack of firewood from the
driest small tree you could find.

01:15:01.824 --> 01:15:02.974
LAURA: Good job, Grog.

01:15:02.974 --> 01:15:03.978
TRAVIS: Hey, Zahra?

01:15:03.978 --> 01:15:04.782
MARY: Well done.

01:15:04.782 --> 01:15:05.732
TRAVIS: Impressed?

01:15:05.732 --> 01:15:07.031
MARY: Yes.

01:15:07.031 --> 01:15:10.552
(laughter)

01:15:10.552 --> 01:15:13.237
SAM: Kord's strength to you, sir.

01:15:13.237 --> 01:15:18.745
MATT: Throwing the wood down, you begin to set up
small stones into a fire pit establishment, and

01:15:18.745 --> 01:15:26.984
begin building a fire as the entirety of the sun
disappears behind the distant mountain range. At

01:15:26.984 --> 01:15:30.469
this point, the temperature has gotten extremely
cold, and most of you begin to pull up your winter

01:15:30.469 --> 01:15:35.867
cloaks and get your bedrolls ready for an
evening's bit of rest. Is there anything in

01:15:35.867 --> 01:15:40.784
particular that you guys want to do before the
night and sleep take you?

01:15:40.784 --> 01:15:43.340
MARY: I would like to go out. Has the moon risen?

01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:51.338
MATT: About two hours into nightfall, you can see
a gentle bit of moonlight begin to appear off the

01:15:51.387 --> 01:15:56.181
distant horizon to the northeast, from your
position. It's hard to see because the trees are

01:15:56.181 --> 01:16:00.195
so thick, but you take a moment to walk through,
and you can see little bits of

01:16:00.195 --> 01:16:01.787
the moonlight peeking.

01:16:01.787 --> 01:16:07.457
MARY: I just bask in what little rays I can for
ten, 15 minutes before retiring.

01:16:07.457 --> 01:16:10.433
MATT: All right. Anything else you wish to do?

01:16:10.433 --> 01:16:19.162
FELICIA: I'm going to change my stone, my
Transmuter Stone, to be resisting ice or cold.

01:16:19.162 --> 01:16:20.675
LAURA: Ah, that's really good.

01:16:20.675 --> 01:16:21.591
TALIESIN: Clever.

01:16:21.591 --> 01:16:23.102
MATT: Good call. Good call, indeed.

01:16:23.102 --> 01:16:28.138
LAURA: I need something like that. Do we have any
magic stuff that makes us resistant?

01:16:28.138 --> 01:16:33.919
MARY: I have a Ring of Protection. May I do that
around the camp?

01:16:33.919 --> 01:16:35.491
MATT: The Ring of Protection is an actual ring you
wear.

01:16:35.491 --> 01:16:36.583
MARY: Oh! I have a ring.

01:16:36.583 --> 01:16:37.688
MATT: Yes, and it protects you.

01:16:37.688 --> 01:16:38.930
MARY: And it protects me.

01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:40.034
MATT: Yep. (laughs)

01:16:40.034 --> 01:16:42.710
MARY: You see? I'm learning everything. Not all at
once.

01:16:42.710 --> 01:16:43.911
LAURA: I have one, too.

01:16:43.911 --> 01:16:45.490
MARY: Oh, you do? Oh, yours is nice.

01:16:45.490 --> 01:16:48.096
MATT: Very helpful.

01:16:48.096 --> 01:16:54.743
LAURA: Yeah, but we don't have any ice-resistant
things, outside of that damn--

01:16:54.896 --> 01:16:57.882
TALIESIN: Or fire spells. Fire spells would be
very--

01:16:57.882 --> 01:16:59.311
FELICIA: Oh, I have a fire spell.

01:16:59.311 --> 01:17:00.131
TALIESIN: Excellent.

01:17:00.131 --> 01:17:02.406
FELICIA: That's how I took down the worg. So,
anyway, we were in the forest--

01:17:02.406 --> 01:17:09.549
MARY: How powerful is it? Because I can conjure
something and it would be very-- too large for

01:17:09.549 --> 01:17:10.771
this particular--

01:17:10.771 --> 01:17:14.368
FELICIA: I mean, I think a Fireball would not help
here. I can do Firebolt, but there's really no use

01:17:14.368 --> 01:17:15.456
until we get there.

01:17:15.456 --> 01:17:16.502
LAURA: Are we starting a fire?

01:17:16.502 --> 01:17:17.431
FELICIA: I can start the fire.

01:17:17.431 --> 01:17:18.880
SAM: Do we not have a fire going?

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.076
LAURA: Yeah, of course we do.

01:17:20.076 --> 01:17:24.864
MATT: You guys look over and Grog is sitting
there, rubbing wood together.

01:17:24.864 --> 01:17:26.592
LAURA: Grog, one second. Here--

01:17:26.592 --> 01:17:28.218
TRAVIS: No, I'm probably getting so close.

01:17:28.218 --> 01:17:29.910
(laughter)

01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:32.357
TRAVIS: Fine. Take all the joy out of everything.

01:17:32.357 --> 01:17:38.094
MATT: The ranger, who is very well-experienced in
surviving in woodland areas, starts the fire that

01:17:38.094 --> 01:17:45.359
had taken you a good five, six minutes of
aggressively fighting against the water-soaked

01:17:45.359 --> 01:17:49.019
wood of this woodland. (snaps) She lights the
flames.

01:17:49.019 --> 01:17:50.854
TRAVIS: I warmed it up first.

01:17:50.854 --> 01:17:52.634
LAURA: Thank you, Grog. You did. You really did.

01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:53.810
TRAVIS: Yeah. You're welcome.

01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:55.080
MATT: All right. Anyone keeping watch?

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.252
TALIESIN: I'll keep watch.

01:17:56.252 --> 01:17:57.808
MATT: All right, so you're taking first watch.

01:17:57.808 --> 01:17:58.746
TALIESIN: I'll take first watch.

01:17:58.746 --> 01:18:01.392
SAM: She had already-- Zahra had volunteered.

01:18:01.451 --> 01:18:02.732
FELICIA: Zahra had first watch.

01:18:02.732 --> 01:18:03.801
TALIESIN: I'll take second watch, then.

01:18:03.801 --> 01:18:04.746
FELICIA: You can take second watch.

01:18:04.746 --> 01:18:06.412
MATT: All right, so Zahra takes first watch. Percy
takes second watch.

01:18:06.412 --> 01:18:07.901
LAURA: Can I watch with Zahra?

01:18:07.901 --> 01:18:09.255
MATT: If you'd like to.

01:18:09.255 --> 01:18:10.125
TRAVIS: Third watch.

01:18:10.125 --> 01:18:11.320
MATT: Third watch for Grog. All right.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.178
SAM: No watch.

01:18:12.178 --> 01:18:14.810
FELICIA: I'm-- I would take watch, just for the
record, but I just get so peckish--

01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:16.670
TRAVIS: You just sleep. You need your beauty
rest.

01:18:16.670 --> 01:18:18.161
SAM: I'm sleeping, yes. Thank you.

01:18:18.161 --> 01:18:20.219
TALIESIN: You're going to be clear for leading
tomorrow.

01:18:20.219 --> 01:18:23.645
FELICIA: I really need my head clear, and I just
cannot function without sleep.

01:18:23.645 --> 01:18:24.834
There was one time, when I--

01:18:24.834 --> 01:18:26.442
TRAVIS: Oh, man. No, no, yeah.

01:18:26.442 --> 01:18:27.711
MARY: I think-- shall we?

01:18:27.711 --> 01:18:28.617
LAURA: Yes.

01:18:28.617 --> 01:18:30.030
MARY: First watch, Percy.

01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:30.974
LAURA: No.

01:18:30.974 --> 01:18:32.221
MARY: Oh, is it you and I?

01:18:32.221 --> 01:18:33.159
LAURA: It was us.

01:18:33.159 --> 01:18:34.063
TALIESIN: I'm second watch.

01:18:34.063 --> 01:18:35.077
MARY: I'm so sorry.

01:18:35.077 --> 01:18:39.508
MATT: All right. As the rest of you make your
bedrolls, prepare and gather around the fire,

01:18:39.508 --> 01:18:43.931
eventually drift off to sleep. Vex and Zahra are
left awake.

01:18:43.931 --> 01:18:52.360
MARY: You need help carrying your purse? Your
bag?

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:55.071
LAURA: Oh, no. It's quite comfortable against my
side, actually.

01:18:55.071 --> 01:18:56.912
MARY: Could I feel how heavy it is?

01:18:56.912 --> 01:18:59.391
LAURA: It's not heavy at all. We don't have
anything in it, darling.

01:18:59.391 --> 01:19:00.342
MARY: Oh, all right.

01:19:00.342 --> 01:19:02.331
LAURA: Where do you come from?

01:19:02.331 --> 01:19:08.572
MARY: (exhales) I come--

01:19:08.572 --> 01:19:11.810
LAURA: We just don't see very many tieflings
around here.

01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:16.599
MARY: No. I come from very far away. It took quite
a long time for me to get here. I come from the

01:19:16.599 --> 01:19:18.095
land of Feren.

01:19:18.095 --> 01:19:19.074
LAURA: Feren.

01:19:19.074 --> 01:19:25.137
MARY: Yes. Very far-off, mountainous, dark. Very
dark.

01:19:25.137 --> 01:19:28.423
LAURA: And you left because...?

01:19:28.423 --> 01:19:39.924
MARY: My father was killed, and I was left on my
own in the woods, so I left.

01:19:39.924 --> 01:19:42.593
LAURA: That sounds familiar.

01:19:42.593 --> 01:19:44.012
MARY: Oh, it does?

01:19:44.012 --> 01:19:45.613
LAURA: Yes, actually.

01:19:45.613 --> 01:19:47.004
MARY: Why? Why is that?

01:19:47.004 --> 01:19:48.406
LAURA: My mother was killed.

01:19:48.406 --> 01:19:49.415
MARY: She was?

01:19:49.415 --> 01:19:50.279
LAURA: Yes.

01:19:50.279 --> 01:19:51.278
MARY: By whom?

01:19:51.278 --> 01:19:54.998
LAURA: A dragon. (sighs) I wonder if it was
white.

01:19:54.998 --> 01:19:57.178
MARY: I wonder if it was.

01:19:57.178 --> 01:19:59.573
TRAVIS: Shit. I mean, (snores)

01:19:59.573 --> 01:20:01.054
MARY: What about your father?

01:20:01.054 --> 01:20:02.343
LAURA: My father's alive.

01:20:02.343 --> 01:20:03.837
MARY: And what is he?

01:20:03.837 --> 01:20:05.373
LAURA: An asshole, actually.

01:20:05.373 --> 01:20:06.937
MARY: Really? Mine was an asshole too.

01:20:06.937 --> 01:20:07.879
LAURA: Really?

01:20:07.879 --> 01:20:09.477
MARY: He was. He was a dark wizard. He was awful.

01:20:09.477 --> 01:20:11.534
LAURA: Oh, wow. Mine's just a jerk.

01:20:11.534 --> 01:20:13.327
MARY: He kept me in a cage.

01:20:13.327 --> 01:20:15.584
LAURA: Zahra.

01:20:15.584 --> 01:20:16.647
MARY: I know.

01:20:16.647 --> 01:20:18.549
LAURA: Getting a bit personal here around the
fire.

01:20:18.549 --> 01:20:22.325
MARY: Sorry. I thought we were bonding.

01:20:22.325 --> 01:20:26.192
LAURA: (laughs) Here. Have some food.

01:20:26.192 --> 01:20:28.526
MARY: Thank you. God, what is this?

01:20:28.526 --> 01:20:31.273
LAURA: Disgusting. Grog found it. I don't know.

01:20:31.273 --> 01:20:32.376
TRAVIS: It's wood.

01:20:32.376 --> 01:20:38.073
MARY: Is it wood? All right, well at least it's
elm.

01:20:38.073 --> 01:20:40.240
LAURA: Oh.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:45.089
MATT: As you guys munch and awkwardly make your
way through conversation through the evening,

01:20:45.089 --> 01:20:47.752
eventually your watch comes to a close, and you
guys are able to rest.

01:20:47.752 --> 01:20:49.826
Percy, you take up second watch.

01:20:49.826 --> 01:20:50.995
TALIESIN: I do.

01:20:50.995 --> 01:20:58.954
MATT: About three, four hours go by--

01:20:58.954 --> 01:21:00.726
TALIESIN: (whispers) Oh, bollocks.

01:21:00.726 --> 01:21:06.928
MATT: Without incident. Eventually, your watch
comes to a close. You find yourself just past the

01:21:06.928 --> 01:21:10.618
middle of the night period of the evening. Who has
the third watch? Is that--

01:21:10.618 --> 01:21:11.748
TRAVIS: I do.

01:21:11.748 --> 01:21:12.875
MATT: Grog. All right.

01:21:12.875 --> 01:21:13.681
TALIESIN: Wake up, Grog.

01:21:13.681 --> 01:21:15.519
TRAVIS: What? Mom? (screams and flails)

01:21:15.519 --> 01:21:16.526
LAURA: Ugh. Grog.

01:21:16.526 --> 01:21:17.678
TRAVIS: Sorry.

01:21:17.678 --> 01:21:20.324
MARY: Is he always this loud?

01:21:20.324 --> 01:21:21.998
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yes.

01:21:21.998 --> 01:21:23.029
MARY: All right.

01:21:23.029 --> 01:21:26.876
TRAVIS: All right, keep sleeping! (whispers) I
mean, keep sleeping. You're safe while I'm out.

01:21:26.876 --> 01:21:28.377
FELICIA: Aldor! What? Huh?

01:21:28.377 --> 01:21:33.416
(laughter)

01:21:33.416 --> 01:21:39.970
MATT: As the rest of you maintain or continue your
sleep. Grog keeps a very watchful eye in the

01:21:39.970 --> 01:21:45.929
darkened woods around. Grog, go ahead and 
make a perception check.

01:21:45.991 --> 01:21:47.343
TRAVIS: Shit. Me?

01:21:47.343 --> 01:21:48.158
MATT: Yeah.

01:21:48.158 --> 01:21:49.198
SAM: Oh, he's the worst.

01:21:49.198 --> 01:21:55.437
TRAVIS: I see everything. Yes! Minus... 16.

01:21:55.437 --> 01:21:56.976
MATT: 16. That's good.

01:21:56.976 --> 01:22:10.461
All right. As you're keeping your eyes
around for any sort of dangerous or encroaching

01:22:10.527 --> 01:22:19.170
villainy, the fire itself is slightly mesmerizing
in its pattern, and you look off to the right. You

01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:25.289
hear the slight snapping of a twig about 15, 20
feet off from the camp.

01:22:25.289 --> 01:22:27.955
TRAVIS: I go to check it out by myself.

01:22:27.955 --> 01:22:29.600
LAURA: What? (groans)

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:33.881
MATT: Okay. You stand up, lifting your axe and
begin to take a few steps away from the camp. As

01:22:33.881 --> 01:22:40.081
you turn around one of the nearby tree trunks, the
first thing you're greeted by in the darkness-- do

01:22:40.081 --> 01:22:41.505
you have Darkvision?

01:22:41.505 --> 01:22:47.053
TRAVIS: I have low-- Wait, the Dwarven Belt of
Beard Power gives me-- I have Darkvision out to a

01:22:47.053 --> 01:22:48.151
range of 60 feet.

01:22:48.151 --> 01:22:49.001
SAM: Wow.

01:22:49.001 --> 01:22:55.106
MATT: You do. So as you turn the corner, you get
about a step before you notice, about 15 feet away

01:22:55.106 --> 01:22:55.825
from you--

01:22:55.825 --> 01:22:56.879
SAM: Your beard tingles.

01:22:56.879 --> 01:23:06.380
MATT: There is a very large fur-covered, wolf-like
creature that is (snarls).

01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:07.422
MARY: Is it a worg?

01:23:07.422 --> 01:23:12.390
MATT: Snarling at you with bony protrusions from
parts of its body. It stands, from ground to top

01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:19.500
of its shoulder, almost up to your entire height,
and it is currently snarling, and behind it you

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:24.143
can see there are two very gingerly stepping
humanoid figures in the darkness.

01:23:24.143 --> 01:23:27.409
TRAVIS: (chuckles) I yell out, PLAYTIME!

01:23:27.409 --> 01:23:30.900
MATT: As you all wake up--

01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:32.162
MARY: Where is he?

01:23:32.162 --> 01:23:33.843
MATT: We're going to go to our break.

01:23:33.843 --> 01:23:36.104
(cheering)

01:23:36.104 --> 01:23:42.468
MATT: All right, so we're gonna take a quick break
here for us to go ahead and feed real fast on the

01:23:42.468 --> 01:23:45.709
wonderful food purchased by our beautiful
chatroom.

01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:47.668
(cheering)

01:23:47.668 --> 01:23:51.208
MATT: And we'll be back here. We're also going to
show a really cool video as we recently put up our

01:23:51.208 --> 01:23:56.883
challenge to the Critter-verse-- of all the
Critters that watch the show, the-- (chuckles),

01:23:56.930 --> 01:24:01.652
the Cancer Cream Pie Challenge. Those of you who
haven't seen it can go look it up.

01:24:01.652 --> 01:24:02.498
LAURA: Cream cancer.

01:24:02.498 --> 01:24:03.351
MATT: Cream cancer.

01:24:03.351 --> 01:24:04.369
MARY: Cream cancer.

01:24:04.369 --> 01:24:05.050
MATT: Yeah.

01:24:05.050 --> 01:24:06.097
TALIESIN: Cancer of the cream.

01:24:06.097 --> 01:24:08.957
MATT: Cancer of the cream, if you will. A bunch of
our fans took up the challenge, and there's a

01:24:08.957 --> 01:24:12.197
wonderful video compilation of that. We'll go
ahead and put that up here in a moment, but we'll

01:24:12.197 --> 01:24:16.377
be back shortly to to see what dangers have been
unveiled in the nearby forest.

01:24:16.377 --> 01:24:17.289
TRAVIS: Yar.

01:24:17.289 --> 01:24:18.665
MATT: See you momentarily.

01:24:18.665 --> 01:33:49.561
[break]

01:33:49.668 --> 01:33:55.209
MATT: Welcome back. So, a couple things we wanted
to mention before we jump back into the game. I'm

01:33:55.357 --> 01:33:58.783
sure you guys have noticed our new format. We're
trying out different-- new visual styles for the

01:33:58.783 --> 01:34:04.043
show to match the mood and up the quality of it.
We're working out some kinks and appreciate you

01:34:04.043 --> 01:34:07.851
hanging with us in that, and things will
progressively get better as we push forward from

01:34:07.851 --> 01:34:12.869
here. We hope you like the new format. This is all
put together by our wonderful Overlord and his

01:34:12.869 --> 01:34:20.698
crack team of twitch experts. Also, wanted to
mention to you guys the '5k and a bear' t-shirts

01:34:20.698 --> 01:34:23.479
that are up because of the ridiculous Trinket--

01:34:23.479 --> 01:34:26.062
LAURA: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:34:26.062 --> 01:34:30.223
MATT: 5k arrival from last week's episode, is
available for one more day. So if you want to get

01:34:30.271 --> 01:34:34.567
that, get it soon, because once it's gone it's
gone. So make sure to go check that out if you're

01:34:34.567 --> 01:34:43.744
interested. Other than that, are we good to go
ahead and continue? Perfect. All right. First and

01:34:43.801 --> 01:34:47.132
foremost, I would like everyone to roll
initiative.

01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:47.939
LAURA: Oh God.

01:34:47.939 --> 01:34:49.012
TALIESIN: Yay!

01:34:49.012 --> 01:34:50.796
LAURA: How did I just immediately forget that's
what we were doing?

01:34:50.796 --> 01:34:51.764
MARY: How do I do that?

01:34:51.764 --> 01:34:52.552
TRAVIS: You take a d20.

01:34:52.552 --> 01:34:53.479
MARY: Okay.

01:34:53.479 --> 01:34:54.712
TRAVIS: And roll it.

01:34:54.712 --> 01:34:55.647
TALIESIN: Eh.

01:34:55.647 --> 01:34:56.837
FELICIA: (retches)

01:34:56.837 --> 01:35:00.008
TRAVIS: Look at that. Add initiative, which is...

01:35:00.008 --> 01:35:02.163
MARY: Oh. Heh. I don't know how that's possible,
but yeah!

01:35:02.163 --> 01:35:03.934
TRAVIS: Shit. Better.

01:35:03.934 --> 01:35:05.498
FELICIA: Oh, it's a pen.

01:35:05.498 --> 01:35:06.930
TALIESIN: There should be a laser in there
somewhere.

01:35:06.930 --> 01:35:08.185
FELICIA: Oh yeah!

01:35:08.185 --> 01:35:11.547
TALIESIN: So that way you can vaguely say, move me
there.

01:35:11.547 --> 01:35:12.845
FELICIA: I love it.

01:35:12.845 --> 01:35:16.716
LAURA: Oh! I have to put my glasses on today.

01:35:16.716 --> 01:35:18.264
FELICIA: Yeah, it's far away.

01:35:18.264 --> 01:35:19.818
SAM: You mean your magic glasses.

01:35:19.818 --> 01:35:21.287
LAURA: My magic glasses of seeing.

01:35:21.287 --> 01:35:22.219
MATT: Indeed.

01:35:22.219 --> 01:35:25.146
SAM: This is so exciting!

01:35:25.146 --> 01:35:26.975
MATT: All righty. So.

01:35:27.131 --> 01:35:31.134
SAM: Mary and Felicia don't know. This is fun,
come on.

01:35:31.134 --> 01:35:32.369
FELICIA: Thank you.

01:35:32.369 --> 01:35:34.153
MARY: This is amazing, guys.

01:35:34.153 --> 01:35:35.627
TALIESIN: It's okay.

01:35:35.627 --> 01:35:38.677
MATT: Cool. So. Initiative rolls for everyone--

01:35:38.677 --> 01:35:39.904
TALIESIN: Blind Matt Mercer.

01:35:39.904 --> 01:35:45.127
MATT: There will be a mild surprise round here
except for Grog, but we have initiatives from

01:35:45.127 --> 01:35:46.569
here. Percy, what you got?

01:35:46.569 --> 01:35:47.597
TALIESIN: 16.

01:35:47.597 --> 01:35:50.432
MATT: 16 for Percy. Felicia?

01:35:50.432 --> 01:35:51.455
FELICIA: Four!

01:35:51.455 --> 01:35:53.175
(laughter)

01:35:53.175 --> 01:35:54.329
TALIESIN: Whoa!

01:35:54.329 --> 01:35:55.638
FELICIA: Thank you, Thank you.

01:35:55.638 --> 01:35:57.126
SAM: Eight!

01:35:57.126 --> 01:35:58.368
MATT: Okay, Lyra and Scanlan.

01:35:58.368 --> 01:35:59.881
LAURA: Eight.

01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:00.989
TRAVIS: Holy crap.

01:36:00.989 --> 01:36:02.059
LAURA: Yep.

01:36:02.059 --> 01:36:03.059
MARY: Five.

01:36:03.059 --> 01:36:04.803
LAURA: Oh God. Why did we all roll terribly.

01:36:04.803 --> 01:36:06.299
MATT: You guys. (laughs)

01:36:06.299 --> 01:36:08.204
TRAVIS: We'll be dead. We'll be dead before we
leave.

01:36:08.204 --> 01:36:11.682
MATT: Oh this is wonderful, you're all going to
die.

01:36:11.682 --> 01:36:15.291
SAM: You're all going to die, man!

01:36:15.291 --> 01:36:17.187
TALIESIN: That's never a good sign.

01:36:17.187 --> 01:36:19.027
LAURA: I should have grabbed some of that dessert
that's here.

01:36:19.027 --> 01:36:19.883
TRAVIS: 16.

01:36:19.883 --> 01:36:22.572
MATT: Percy, you were 16 as well?

01:36:22.572 --> 01:36:23.566
TALIESIN: 16.

01:36:23.566 --> 01:36:25.909
SAM: I just had a couple. They're great, and I'm
sure Liam could get us some more.

01:36:25.909 --> 01:36:27.425
MARY: Maybe your brother--

01:36:27.425 --> 01:36:31.336
MATT: All right. So. In this regard, Grog.

01:36:31.336 --> 01:36:32.223
TRAVIS: Yeah?

01:36:32.223 --> 01:36:35.812
MATT: You are actually going first. Everyone else,
you're currently in the process of waking up so

01:36:35.812 --> 01:36:37.907
there's going to be a round before it gets to the
rest of you.

01:36:37.907 --> 01:36:39.171
LAURA: Trinket! Wake up!

01:36:39.171 --> 01:36:42.178
MATT: Trinket wakes up. Grog.

01:36:42.178 --> 01:36:43.155
TRAVIS: Eh?

01:36:43.155 --> 01:36:46.604
MATT: You look, and you see the big, dire
wolf-like creature is currently staring at you

01:36:46.604 --> 01:36:51.039
across the way, and you see other entities,
humanoid, coming towards you. As your Darkvision

01:36:51.039 --> 01:36:56.697
allows you to take up their features you can see
these are very heavily fur covered, dense leather

01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:05.052
armor protected, roving band of straight up orcs
that are currently converging on the campsite from

01:37:05.052 --> 01:37:07.755
the center of the woods. What are you going to
do?

01:37:07.755 --> 01:37:13.216
TRAVIS: You look like someone I just saw recently.
I would like to Rage, and I will charge the dire

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:16.559
wolf puppy-thing and swing at its head with my
great-axe.

01:37:16.559 --> 01:37:22.152
MATT: All right. So you immediately go into a
Grog-style charge. You guys can hear Grog yelling

01:37:22.152 --> 01:37:26.668
in furious anger, echoing through the nearby wood
in the direction you heard his initial shout that

01:37:26.668 --> 01:37:32.038
woke you up. Grog, you rush forward towards the
dire wolf. Go ahead and make your two attacks.

01:37:32.038 --> 01:37:34.069
TRAVIS: 26.

01:37:34.069 --> 01:37:35.784
MATT: That hits.

01:37:35.784 --> 01:37:38.229
TRAVIS: Ah! 25.

01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:39.579
MATT: Both hit!

01:37:39.579 --> 01:37:40.671
TRAVIS: That was really good.

01:37:40.671 --> 01:37:42.499
MATT: Nice. Go ahead and roll some damage.

01:37:42.499 --> 01:37:46.597
TRAVIS: Thank you. Ten and 18, is 28.

01:37:46.597 --> 01:37:51.399
MATT: Great. So as you rush forward, your axe
hits into the side of the dire wolf.

01:37:51.399 --> 01:37:56.659
Slamming into its shoulder, you can see as you
draw the axe out of the wound, you've left a nice

01:37:56.659 --> 01:38:02.009
hearty gash into the muscle tissue that holds its
arm to its shoulder. The other one, as you bring

01:38:02.009 --> 01:38:05.845
your axe around the other side it slams into the
upper part of its back. It sinks a good three or

01:38:05.845 --> 01:38:10.602
four inches into it and the dire wolf (rrgaaah)
just reacts to the pain with a guttural screech

01:38:10.602 --> 01:38:16.648
and then looks up at you, releasing its lips apart
for these nasty looking, sharp, long dire wolf

01:38:16.648 --> 01:38:21.974
fangs revealed as it prepares itself to pounce
back. That ends your turn?

01:38:21.974 --> 01:38:22.977
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:38:22.977 --> 01:38:28.787
MATT: As part of this round, the dire wolf is
going to return, as the two nearest orcs charge in

01:38:28.787 --> 01:38:31.112
to flank Grog.

01:38:31.112 --> 01:38:32.374
MARY: Oh no.

01:38:32.374 --> 01:38:37.245
MATT: This guy is going to move... One, two,
three... six... can't quite-- there. Is going to

01:38:37.245 --> 01:38:43.003
use its action to dash in here and loom over. So
as you're waking up you see this orc come

01:38:43.003 --> 01:38:44.171
lumbering around one of the trees--

01:38:44.171 --> 01:38:45.072
FELICIA: (gasps)

01:38:45.072 --> 01:38:46.440
SAM: Oh no! You? You're eating!

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:49.101
MATT: -- with this giant club and just
gets in front of you. As you're freaking out,

01:38:49.101 --> 01:38:51.539
another one flanks around and comes up towards
Percy.

01:38:51.539 --> 01:38:53.564
TALIESIN: Hm!

01:38:53.564 --> 01:38:59.652
MATT: Another one rushes up behind Scanlan there.
And you see, behind-- another growl and a series

01:38:59.652 --> 01:39:05.273
of heavy footfalls as-- not quite an ogre, not
quite an orc; like some sort-of ogre/orc

01:39:05.273 --> 01:39:09.078
crossbreed, comes walking behind one of the other
trees to go up behind Percy on that side

01:39:09.078 --> 01:39:10.125
LAURA: Oh God!

01:39:10.125 --> 01:39:11.105
SAM: Oh my Grog.

01:39:11.105 --> 01:39:12.017
FELICIA: Oh no!

01:39:12.017 --> 01:39:13.066
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh my Grog.

01:39:13.066 --> 01:39:18.176
MATT: And from the far end over here another orc
moves forward one, two, three, four, five... six--

01:39:18.176 --> 01:39:22.078
And he's going to use his action to finish his
movement here on Percy, as well.

01:39:22.078 --> 01:39:23.430
TALIESIN: Oh God!

01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:25.059
LAURA: Are they attacking Percy?

01:39:25.059 --> 01:39:34.440
MATT: Yes. Currently there's only two attacks on
you from this ogre-like creature and this orc. Oh,

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:40.518
that's not going to be very good. That would be a
nine?

01:39:40.518 --> 01:39:41.427
TALIESIN: No.

01:39:41.427 --> 01:39:42.708
MATT: What's your AC?

01:39:42.708 --> 01:39:43.802
TALIESIN: 18.

01:39:43.802 --> 01:39:47.594
MATT: 18, that is not going to hit. And then we
also have-- that'll be a 22.

01:39:47.594 --> 01:39:48.817
TALIESIN: That's going to hit.

01:39:48.817 --> 01:39:55.666
MATT: All right, so the giant ogre-ish type
creature comes rushing towards you. Swings with

01:39:55.666 --> 01:39:59.947
its giant club and slams the ground next you as
you manage to roll out of the way and get up to

01:39:59.947 --> 01:40:05.440
your feet, and as you do the orc to the other side
swings with what looks like a heavy axe and it

01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:10.623
nicks you in the side of the shoulder blade,
dealing 12 points of slashing damage.

01:40:10.623 --> 01:40:12.207
TALIESIN: Hm!

01:40:12.207 --> 01:40:19.588
MATT: We have-- this guy just barely gets to
Scanlan. Scanlan, as you're standing up one of the

01:40:19.588 --> 01:40:22.804
orcs rushes up behind and you see he's holding
another large, double-handed great axe--

01:40:22.804 --> 01:40:34.155
SAM: I sing-- (sings) No I don't want to get hurt,
by you. Doo doo doo doo.

01:40:34.155 --> 01:40:40.201
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll the d10 to
reduce the attack modifier on that one.

01:40:40.201 --> 01:40:42.324
TRAVIS: (laughs) Where does this come from?

01:40:42.324 --> 01:40:45.210
MATT: Rolled a 24 by the way.

01:40:45.210 --> 01:40:47.746
SAM: Okay, so I reduce that by two.

01:40:47.746 --> 01:40:49.148
MATT: 22.

01:40:49.148 --> 01:40:53.741
SAM: Yes, so he'll still hit, but he got a song
out of it.

01:40:53.741 --> 01:40:56.555
TRAVIS: (laughs) Lucky bastard.

01:40:56.555 --> 01:41:03.703
MATT: Well there you go. All right, that will come
to another 12 points of slashing damage. As the

01:41:03.703 --> 01:41:08.419
axe swings down, you manage to just pull out of
the way so it hits the armor and deflects, but it

01:41:08.419 --> 01:41:13.673
leaves a huge gash in the front of the armor and
just the sheer weight of it kind of shook you for

01:41:13.673 --> 01:41:14.930
a second.

01:41:14.930 --> 01:41:16.177
SAM: Ahh!

01:41:16.177 --> 01:41:21.388
MATT: That'll bring us to Grog, who is currently
being heavily flanked. First the dire wolf is

01:41:21.388 --> 01:41:27.498
going to snatch at you because it's not happy with
your series of attacks, and with Pack Tactics it

01:41:27.498 --> 01:41:35.419
has advantage because it's within five feet of
other allies. So, its bite attack against you with

01:41:35.419 --> 01:41:37.562
advantage is a-- natural 20.

01:41:37.562 --> 01:41:38.673
LAURA: Oh no.

01:41:38.673 --> 01:41:39.952
FELICIA: Oh no.

01:41:39.952 --> 01:41:43.022
MATT: Using my new Critical Role dice.

01:41:43.022 --> 01:41:44.587
LAURA: We're all going to die.

01:41:44.587 --> 01:41:46.377
TALIESIN: Thanks chatroom. Thank you.

01:41:46.377 --> 01:41:48.204
FELICIA: Yes, chatroom.

01:41:48.204 --> 01:41:53.207
MATT: It's 21 points of piercing damage from the
jaws which is reduced

01:41:53.207 --> 01:41:54.607
by half because of your Rage.

01:41:54.607 --> 01:41:55.968
TRAVIS: Yes, so 11?

01:41:55.968 --> 01:42:01.718
MATT: Yep. That finishes the dire wolf's turn. The
two other orcs are also going to swing at you from

01:42:01.718 --> 01:42:07.173
the sides. They have advantage because they're
flanking you. That's going to be a 17.

01:42:07.173 --> 01:42:08.433
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:42:08.433 --> 01:42:13.676
MATT: And then with advantage on that one: 16.
Also misses. They're just swinging

01:42:13.676 --> 01:42:20.824
at you with no effect. That completes the surprise
round. The orcs have pounced onto your campsite.

01:42:20.824 --> 01:42:23.783
Back at the top of the order we have Percy. What
are you doing first?

01:42:23.783 --> 01:42:33.187
TALIESIN: Going to cry a little. So,
I have three orcs basically-- or two orcs and a

01:42:33.187 --> 01:42:34.731
god-knows-what?

01:42:34.731 --> 01:42:40.512
MATT: Yeah, it's too small to be an ogre but it's
too big to be an orc. A very unholy union of the

01:42:40.512 --> 01:42:43.320
two probably created this spawn.

01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:50.960
TALIESIN: The first thing I'm going to do, is I'm
going to take a Fire Shot to the right to that

01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:57.193
giant monstrosity and spend a Grit point to try to
shoot him in the foot.

01:42:57.255 --> 01:42:58.437
MATT: Okay.

01:42:58.437 --> 01:43:04.461
TALIESIN: -- makes a constitution saving throw.
Okay, these rules are new, so pardon me if I'm a

01:43:04.461 --> 01:43:16.004
little iffy. So shot with Pepperbox is-- wow,
what's wrong with me? 28 to hit.

01:43:16.004 --> 01:43:20.846
MATT: 28 definitely hits. He has to make a saving
throw or be knocked prone?

01:43:20.846 --> 01:43:23.663
TALIESIN: Well yeah, there's damage plus a saving
throw.

01:43:23.663 --> 01:43:28.096
He has to make a constitution saving throw.

01:43:28.096 --> 01:43:29.781
MATT: All right.

01:43:29.781 --> 01:43:34.319
TALIESIN: Eight plus my proficiency modifier plus
my dexterity modifier.

01:43:34.319 --> 01:43:36.236
MATT: Four plus six, so it would be 18?

01:43:36.236 --> 01:43:42.832
TALIESIN: It's actually ten. 18, yeah, you're
right.

01:43:42.832 --> 01:43:46.944
MATT: Yeah, he does not make that. So you shoot,
he gets knocked prone. As you shoot

01:43:46.944 --> 01:43:51.643
his foot out from under him, he stumbles to one
knee and then you just kick out and push him onto

01:43:51.643 --> 01:43:53.506
his back. That's the first shot.

01:43:53.506 --> 01:43:59.590
TALIESIN: And it does six points of damage-- I'm
sorry, it does 12 points of damage plus three

01:43:59.590 --> 01:44:01.021
points of fire damage.

01:44:01.021 --> 01:44:02.398
MATT: Nice.

01:44:02.398 --> 01:44:15.032
TALIESIN: And now my other shot. Marking that off.
I'm going to shoot him while he's down.

01:44:15.032 --> 01:44:16.395
MATT: Okay.

01:44:16.395 --> 01:44:18.198
TALIESIN: So, do I get a bonus to hit there?

01:44:18.198 --> 01:44:19.640
MATT: You have advantage because he's prone.

01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:21.155
TALIESIN: Okay, I get advantage. So I'm actually
using--

01:44:21.155 --> 01:44:23.640
MATT: He's right there in front of you and he's
not able to really dodge effectively, so I'm going

01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:24.944
to give you advantage on this attack.

01:44:24.944 --> 01:44:26.291
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'm using Sharpshooter then.

01:44:26.291 --> 01:44:27.653
TRAVIS: Get him Percy!

01:44:27.653 --> 01:44:34.792
TALIESIN: Thank God. Natural 20! So, this is going
to suck for him!

01:44:34.836 --> 01:44:37.096
MATT: Which regenerates your Grit point you just
used, by the way.

01:44:37.096 --> 01:44:38.823
TALIESIN: Does it? I'm back to three?

01:44:38.823 --> 01:44:40.440
MATT: You get a Grit point whenever you crit.

01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:47.836
TALIESIN: Every time I crit, that's right!
Math! Okay, so I get double points

01:44:47.886 --> 01:44:49.562
right? That's how this--

01:44:49.562 --> 01:44:51.989
MATT: Roll the dice and double the number you
get.

01:44:51.989 --> 01:45:00.934
TALIESIN: Okay. Oh, that kind of sucks. Seven, 14,
24, 25... 30 points of damage.

01:45:00.934 --> 01:45:03.868
(cheering)

01:45:03.868 --> 01:45:07.409
MATT: While it's on the ground, it looks up at you
and snarls. You removed your boot from where you

01:45:07.409 --> 01:45:12.324
kicked it down. You bring the gun down, aim it,
and give it a glare as you fire with the

01:45:12.324 --> 01:45:18.337
Pepperbox. As you do, you blast part of its jaw
off and you see it-- You see blood

01:45:18.337 --> 01:45:21.880
starting to trickle and pour down the front of its
chest and it's trying to get up angrily, reaching

01:45:21.939 --> 01:45:27.649
for its club which is currently in the half snow
floor of this forest interior. It's looking pretty

01:45:27.649 --> 01:45:30.356
rough, but it's looking very intent on getting
vengeance on you.

01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:33.588
TALIESIN: Out of idle curiosity, if I try to make
a break for it they would get two attacks of

01:45:33.588 --> 01:45:34.949
opportunity against me, right?

01:45:34.949 --> 01:45:37.171
MATT: Yes. Yes, they are harrying you pretty
heavily right now.

01:45:37.171 --> 01:45:41.983
TALIESIN: Ooh, that doesn't make my life any
better does it. No, never mind then.

01:45:41.983 --> 01:45:48.654
TRAVIS: Do it, Percy!

01:45:48.654 --> 01:45:52.000
TALIESIN: Actually, you know what? I'm pulling an
Action Surge. Two more shots.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.308
MATT: Go for it.

01:45:53.308 --> 01:45:55.020
TALIESIN: I'm shooting him two more times while
he's on the ground.

01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:56.083
MATT: All right.

01:45:56.083 --> 01:45:57.784
TALIESIN: Same thing with a plus ten to hit with a
Sharpshooter.

01:45:57.784 --> 01:45:58.923
MATT: Yep. He still has--

01:45:58.923 --> 01:46:00.056
TALIESIN: Disadvantage?

01:46:00.056 --> 01:46:01.805
MATT: Advantage to your shot because he's still on
the ground.

01:46:01.805 --> 01:46:04.578
TALIESIN: 23 to hit.

01:46:04.578 --> 01:46:06.706
MATT: 23 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on that.

01:46:06.706 --> 01:46:15.816
TALIESIN: Let's see. Sorry, trying to do this...
five plus 16, so 21 points of damage.

01:46:15.816 --> 01:46:21.183
MATT: 21 points of damage. All right, with that
shot as it's getting up and reaches for its club,

01:46:21.183 --> 01:46:25.607
it gets hold of it and starts bringing it in an
arc towards you. You lower the gun again, this

01:46:25.656 --> 01:46:30.620
time shooting for the other side of its face.
With an echoing blasting sound you see the

01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:35.533
remainder of its lower jaw and head just blown out
the back of it. Its eyes roll back.

01:46:35.533 --> 01:46:37.184
(cheering)

01:46:37.328 --> 01:46:40.471
LAURA: Instakill!

01:46:40.471 --> 01:46:42.113
TRAVIS: Damn! One turn!

01:46:42.113 --> 01:46:46.172
TALIESIN: And now, I'm going to take that last
shot and swing up and shoot at the one that's to

01:46:46.172 --> 01:46:48.201
the right of--

01:46:48.201 --> 01:46:49.221
MATT: This one?

01:46:49.221 --> 01:46:50.495
TALIESIN: That one right there.

01:46:50.495 --> 01:46:52.246
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll to attack.

01:46:52.246 --> 01:46:54.091
TALIESIN: Oh, God. Natural 20!

01:46:54.091 --> 01:46:55.303
TRAVIS: What the fuck?!

01:46:55.303 --> 01:46:56.719
FELICIA: What the heck?

01:46:56.719 --> 01:46:58.893
LAURA: This is the best night for Percy, ever.

01:46:58.893 --> 01:47:04.645
TALIESIN: I'm just sitting in the corner going
(maniacal laughter)

01:47:04.704 --> 01:47:08.441
TRAVIS: You were sleeping. Are you doing all this
naked, since you were woken up so quickly?

01:47:08.441 --> 01:47:09.561
LAURA: Yes, definitely.

01:47:09.561 --> 01:47:12.687
TALIESIN: I'm in the pajamas with the butt flap,
and the butt flap is down.

01:47:12.687 --> 01:47:13.569
MARY: Yes!

01:47:13.569 --> 01:47:15.019
TALIESIN: The butt flap is down!

01:47:15.019 --> 01:47:16.026
TRAVIS: I applaud.

01:47:16.026 --> 01:47:19.257
MATT: All right. Good to know, because that will
affect your armor class.

01:47:19.257 --> 01:47:24.803
TALIESIN: And that's eight, 16, 26, 27, 28, 29,
31, 32 points of damage.

01:47:24.803 --> 01:47:26.715
MATT: 32 points of damage.

01:47:26.715 --> 01:47:27.837
TRAVIS: What the what?

01:47:27.837 --> 01:47:28.962
LAURA: That's insane.

01:47:28.962 --> 01:47:30.306
TALIESIN: It's a crit.

01:47:30.306 --> 01:47:34.157
LAURA: Can we all get inspiration from seeing
Percy just massacre?

01:47:34.348 --> 01:47:36.302
FELICIA: It's like a John Woo film right now.

01:47:36.302 --> 01:47:38.205
TRAVIS: Yeah, right? With the doves--

01:47:38.205 --> 01:47:41.234
MATT: You all are a little distracted by the other
ones that are currently pushing in. You hear the

01:47:41.234 --> 01:47:46.206
explosions and you see off to the corner, but you
have too many things around you right now. Okay,

01:47:46.206 --> 01:47:50.359
so as you pull back the gun, the orc that's in
front of you that's currently holding its one

01:47:50.359 --> 01:47:55.059
handed axe with two hands is rearing back. You
fire right towards its face. It tries to duck out

01:47:55.059 --> 01:47:58.604
of the way and you smack into its shoulder. With
an explosion you can see its leather armor

01:47:58.604 --> 01:48:03.941
splinters, and its fur kind of burns and curls
back from the flame of the blast, and beneath you

01:48:04.004 --> 01:48:09.358
can see that most of the muscle tissue and exposed
bone is visible as you've blown a giant crater in

01:48:09.358 --> 01:48:11.096
its shoulder.

01:48:11.096 --> 01:48:12.701
LAURA: Gross!

01:48:12.701 --> 01:48:15.681
TALIESIN: That was brilliant. I'm done. Sorry.

01:48:15.681 --> 01:48:16.930
MATT: Grog, you're up.

01:48:16.930 --> 01:48:20.742
TRAVIS: I'm up. I would like to go into a Frenzied
Rage now that I've got all my playmates around me.

01:48:20.742 --> 01:48:25.365
And I would like to take one giant swing in a half
circle, trying to get all three at one time.

01:48:25.365 --> 01:48:27.237
MATT: All right, so attack for each one. Go for it.

01:48:27.237 --> 01:48:29.761
TRAVIS: So that's a 22.

01:48:29.761 --> 01:48:31.625
MATT: That hits the orc. Dire wolf.

01:48:31.625 --> 01:48:33.570
TRAVIS: That's a 23.

01:48:33.570 --> 01:48:35.585
MATT: Hits. And for the last orc.

01:48:35.585 --> 01:48:36.842
LAURA: Hell yeah.

01:48:36.842 --> 01:48:38.607
TRAVIS: 26. 25!

01:48:38.607 --> 01:48:42.042
MATT: Okay, roll damage three times, and it's in
order. This orc over here?

01:48:42.042 --> 01:48:48.989
TRAVIS: 15. 12. And 17.

01:48:48.989 --> 01:48:58.508
MATT: All right. As you (whoosh) swing the axe
around, it clips across the chest of the orc who

01:48:58.508 --> 01:49:04.367
is almost pushed off his feet from the sheer
force. The axe swings, slams into the front

01:49:04.425 --> 01:49:09.087
throat, chest area of the dire wolf with so much
force that it cuts clean through leaving this open

01:49:09.135 --> 01:49:12.581
wound where its main veins just begin to pour its
lifeblood.

01:49:12.581 --> 01:49:13.530
FELICIA: Ew.

01:49:13.530 --> 01:49:17.849
MATT: The dire wolf just gurgles for a
second before slumping onto the ground, motionless.

01:49:17.893 --> 01:49:22.214
With the inertia carrying through its body
it slams into the other orc, who actually has a

01:49:22.214 --> 01:49:28.109
small buckler shield that manages to catch. It
shatters most of the leather and metal that

01:49:28.109 --> 01:49:32.911
encompasses the piece, getting stuck into his
forearm and he yells in your face

01:49:32.911 --> 01:49:36.053
with this kind of guttural shout and he pulls his
own arm off the blade of the axe

01:49:36.053 --> 01:49:37.231
as you withdraw it.

01:49:37.231 --> 01:49:38.393
TRAVIS: Ooh.

01:49:38.393 --> 01:49:43.454
MATT: That concludes your turn. It's now their
turn. All you low initiative rolling motherfuckers

01:49:43.454 --> 01:49:44.570
got to wait!

01:49:44.570 --> 01:49:45.783
(laughter)

01:49:45.783 --> 01:49:47.924
MARY: (sings) Mother! Motherfucker!

01:49:47.924 --> 01:50:00.591
MATT: Let's see. First and foremost, the two guys
that are-- in that motion, the two orcs that you

01:50:00.591 --> 01:50:06.455
just slammed rear back and then retaliate very
heavily against you. They both have advantage

01:50:06.609 --> 01:50:09.882
because they have you flanked. That'll be 22.

01:50:09.882 --> 01:50:11.347
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:50:11.403 --> 01:50:13.450
MATT: And a 14.

01:50:13.450 --> 01:50:14.450
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:50:14.450 --> 01:50:19.265
MATT: Yes. All right. So the one with the buckler
and what looks like a longsword strikes you for

01:50:19.265 --> 01:50:22.457
eight points of slashing damage, of which you take
four.

01:50:22.457 --> 01:50:23.481
TRAVIS: Great.

01:50:23.481 --> 01:50:29.496
MATT: That ends their turn. The one orc that's
overtop of you, Lyra, goes (rggh!) and swings

01:50:29.496 --> 01:50:34.943
in a wide arc down towards you. 
That's going to be a 14.

01:50:35.099 --> 01:50:36.736
FELICIA: I have a 13.

01:50:36.736 --> 01:50:46.333
MATT: Aw, okay. So, as its two handed axe swings
down on top of you, you take six points of

01:50:46.333 --> 01:50:47.431
slashing damage.

01:50:47.431 --> 01:50:48.463
FELICIA: Ouch!

01:50:48.463 --> 01:50:51.831
MATT: You instinctively freak out and back up out
of the way and it actually doesn't hit you, it

01:50:51.831 --> 01:50:56.718
slams into your bedroll. But the sheer impact
shakes you and you can feel the sweat beginning to

01:50:56.718 --> 01:51:06.242
pour from your forehead. That's going to bring us
to this guy here, who's attacking Scanlan. That's

01:51:06.242 --> 01:51:08.086
going to be a 12.

01:51:08.086 --> 01:51:09.281
SAM: Miss!

01:51:09.281 --> 01:51:13.596
MATT: He swings towards your head. Thankfully he's
not used to attacking things so small. You duck

01:51:13.596 --> 01:51:15.167
quickly out of the way.

01:51:15.167 --> 01:51:16.481
SAM: Fuck you!

01:51:16.481 --> 01:51:18.276
(laughter)

01:51:18.276 --> 01:51:23.442
MATT: And that's-- Oh, and the two on Percy, who
are now looking for retribution. They're looking

01:51:23.442 --> 01:51:26.036
a little shaken by the whole experience. The one
that you shot in the shoulder too.

01:51:26.036 --> 01:51:31.243
TALIESIN: I'm just screaming in their face like a
manic pixie. (screams)

01:51:31.243 --> 01:51:33.468
FELICIA: Manic pixie dream gunslinger.

01:51:33.468 --> 01:51:34.521
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:51:34.521 --> 01:51:35.997
MATT: That'll be a 20.

01:51:35.997 --> 01:51:36.948
TALIESIN: I walked into that.

01:51:36.948 --> 01:51:37.878
MATT: 20 to hit.

01:51:37.878 --> 01:51:41.528
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend a Grit point and--
Wait, if my armor class is 20, does that mean they

01:51:41.589 --> 01:51:42.933
still hit?

01:51:42.933 --> 01:51:45.312
MATT: I thought you were wearing your pajamas with
the butt flap?

01:51:45.312 --> 01:51:47.015
ALL: Oh!

01:51:47.015 --> 01:51:48.220
SAM: Details, details.

01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:49.607
LAURA:That's so mean.

01:51:49.607 --> 01:51:53.581
TALIESIN: One day, far in the future, I'll figure
out a way to make you pay for that.

01:51:53.581 --> 01:51:55.346
(laughter)

01:51:55.346 --> 01:51:56.954
TALIESIN: For now, fine. That hits.

01:51:56.954 --> 01:51:59.888
MATT: Sometimes you-- This is what I heard.

01:51:59.888 --> 01:52:01.686
TALIESIN: Damn it.

01:52:01.686 --> 01:52:03.605
TRAVIS: The visualization was worth it alone.

01:52:03.605 --> 01:52:05.622
MATT: And 22 for the second attack.

01:52:05.622 --> 01:52:06.592
TALIESIN: That hits.

01:52:06.592 --> 01:52:09.603
MATT: So both of them strike at once. You don't
quite know which way to dodge, and as you try to

01:52:09.603 --> 01:52:13.070
duck out of the way both blades hit you
simultaneously on the sides.

01:52:13.117 --> 01:52:14.276
LAURA: Oh no!

01:52:14.276 --> 01:52:17.962
MATT: You take four points of damage from one.
Rolled really low.

01:52:17.962 --> 01:52:20.554
That one rolled pretty high, you take 12.

01:52:20.612 --> 01:52:21.663
TALIESIN: 12 total?

01:52:21.663 --> 01:52:22.795
MATT: The total would be 16.

01:52:22.795 --> 01:52:23.803
TALIESIN: Okay, 16.

01:52:23.803 --> 01:52:27.991
MATT: You take 16 points of slashing damage from
the two of those orcs. Now we come to Scanlan.

01:52:27.991 --> 01:52:33.349
SAM: Okay, I turn to the orc who just missed me
and I cast Dominate Person.

01:52:33.349 --> 01:52:34.426
TRAVIS: Yes!

01:52:34.426 --> 01:52:38.416
SAM: With my-- through my Hand Cone of Clarity, of
course.

01:52:38.416 --> 01:52:46.650
MATT: All right. So, as you finish your casting of
the spell you can see the anger in its face

01:52:46.650 --> 01:52:50.960
suddenly drop and subside, and it gives you this
expectant look.

01:52:50.960 --> 01:53:02.425
SAM: I command him to protect our goliath, with
his life if he needs to,

01:53:02.425 --> 01:53:05.077
and retreat from me instantly.

01:53:05.077 --> 01:53:10.156
MATT: Okay. It nods and looks over
towards where Grog is and with this kind of slack

01:53:10.156 --> 01:53:15.045
jawed expression turns and looks like it's ready
to make its way towards Grog next round. Do you

01:53:15.045 --> 01:53:17.376
want to move at all? Or are you staying here?

01:53:17.376 --> 01:53:20.057
SAM: I will move a step towards Lyra.

01:53:20.057 --> 01:53:23.160
MATT: All right. Yeah, he's not currently
threatening you because he is controlled by you.

01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:26.672
So you step back with the fire to your
back, you can feel the heat flickering behind you.

01:53:26.718 --> 01:53:31.285
SAM: And I will just be backup for her, and I also
will inspire her.

01:53:31.331 --> 01:53:32.700
MATT: All right.

01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:41.635
SAM: With a little-- I turn to her, and I start
singing. (sings) And I raise my hand to Lyra and

01:53:41.635 --> 01:53:54.091
say that you could use some Scanlan today.
Tonight I give you a d10.

01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:57.067
(laughter)

01:53:57.067 --> 01:54:01.850
MATT: So with that you have a d10 inspiration dice
that you can add to any d20 roll you need to make.

01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:03.517
It could be an attack, could be a saving throw.

01:54:03.517 --> 01:54:05.640
FELICIA: Okay, great. Thank you.

01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:07.707
MATT: You can roll and if that's not enough, you
can add a d10 to it.

01:54:07.707 --> 01:54:09.189
FELICIA: Okay, great. That's so nice.

01:54:09.189 --> 01:54:12.750
MATT: So that ends Scanlan's turn. Vex, you're
up.

01:54:12.750 --> 01:54:17.357
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast-- How many people are
on Percy?

01:54:17.402 --> 01:54:19.008
MATT: Two currently, flanking him right there.

01:54:19.008 --> 01:54:22.736
LAURA: I'm going to do Hunter's Mark on the
damaged one.

01:54:22.736 --> 01:54:24.127
MATT: Okay.

01:54:24.127 --> 01:54:26.619
LAURA: Should I get-- Yeah, the one that's
damaged.

01:54:26.619 --> 01:54:30.045
MATT: The one that's damaged the most is going to
be this one.

01:54:30.045 --> 01:54:31.669
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's the one.

01:54:31.669 --> 01:54:38.462
LAURA: Yeah! And I'm going to shoot him.

01:54:38.598 --> 01:54:44.498
Through my-- I'm going to shoot him through
my Flaming Bow.

01:54:44.498 --> 01:54:45.610
MATT: All right.

01:54:45.610 --> 01:54:51.463
LAURA: And I also am going to have Trinket attack
him twice. How about that?

01:54:51.463 --> 01:54:52.810
MATT: You can do that.

01:54:52.810 --> 01:54:53.776
LAURA: All right.

01:54:53.776 --> 01:54:56.214
MATT: All right, so Trinket runs around the tree.

01:54:56.272 --> 01:54:57.654
SAM: Never happened before.

01:54:57.654 --> 01:55:03.753
MATT: An unexpected circumstance. So as you turn
around, you go ahead and you point at the orc to

01:55:03.753 --> 01:55:10.683
the side with a flicker of slightly shimmering
white energy. You can see your attention focus and

01:55:10.683 --> 01:55:14.700
clarity crystallize on this one orc who glances
over at you, returning the gaze.

01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:16.117
LAURA: 19 attack.

01:55:16.117 --> 01:55:19.598
MATT: 19 attack does hit. And as the arrow is
released from your bow--

01:55:19.598 --> 01:55:20.920
LAURA: Yes.

01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:22.967
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

01:55:22.967 --> 01:55:40.422
LAURA: Plus the d10 for the flaming. 17 to hit,
and then Trinket's attacks?

01:55:40.422 --> 01:55:46.080
MATT: Yep. Roll twice for Trinket. As the arrow
(sploof) hits him on the chest area and (boom)

01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:50.853
bursts into flames, igniting part of his shoulder.
As he looks down you hear this guttural growl from

01:55:50.853 --> 01:55:53.970
around the corner. As he glances over Trinket
comes jumping out of the shadows

01:55:53.970 --> 01:55:55.344
from behind the tree.

01:55:55.344 --> 01:56:02.154
LAURA: Trinket! I never know what to look at
because I never attack with Trinket.

01:56:02.154 --> 01:56:03.368
MATT: Attack bonus.

01:56:03.368 --> 01:56:05.239
LAURA: Okay. That's 22 for one.

01:56:05.239 --> 01:56:07.425
MATT: 22 hits. Roll for the second attack.

01:56:07.425 --> 01:56:11.952
LAURA: The second one is a 16.

01:56:11.952 --> 01:56:14.381
MATT: 16 just barely hits.

01:56:14.381 --> 01:56:20.504
LAURA: Oh my goodness!

01:56:20.558 --> 01:56:21.989
SAM: Trinket's doing something.

01:56:22.035 --> 01:56:26.395
LAURA: I know! You guys! Does that mean he can
bite twice?

01:56:26.395 --> 01:56:27.663
MATT: Yep.

01:56:27.663 --> 01:56:33.919
LAURA: Okay, he's going to do that. Oh wait, no.
One is going to be bite

01:56:33.919 --> 01:56:35.271
and one is going to be claws.

01:56:35.271 --> 01:56:36.573
SAM: And he dies.

01:56:36.573 --> 01:56:39.760
LAURA: Oh, I didn't do Hunter's Mark on the
previous one. Four for Hunter's Mark.

01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:42.335
MATT: Four additional damage for Hunter's Mark.

01:56:42.335 --> 01:56:53.883
LAURA: 13. No 12, for one attack. And then-- What
did I just do? I did it wrong. That was wrong.

01:56:53.883 --> 01:56:55.659
TRAVIS: What?

01:56:55.659 --> 01:56:59.458
LAURA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is 11 for the first
one.

01:56:59.458 --> 01:57:00.858
MATT: 11 for the first one. All right.

01:57:00.858 --> 01:57:05.904
LAURA: And then the second one. This is so new and
exciting. And 12 for the second.

01:57:05.904 --> 01:57:11.458
MATT: All right. So, as Trinket rushes around the
corner with one claw (whacks) hits him in the back

01:57:11.458 --> 01:57:15.519
of the shoulder sending him onto the ground. The
orc now, shoulder in flames, is on its back.

01:57:15.519 --> 01:57:20.229
Trinket leaps on top, reaches down and with its
jaws around its head

01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:22.452
just bites the head off.

01:57:22.452 --> 01:57:24.007
ALL: Ohh!

01:57:24.007 --> 01:57:29.808
MATT: As you see the head flip into the air, 
catches the head in his jaws and

01:57:29.808 --> 01:57:31.319
crunches down on it.

01:57:31.504 --> 01:57:33.548
LAURA: Yes! Have a meal, buddy!

01:57:33.548 --> 01:57:35.815
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, you want to cuddle with that?

01:57:35.815 --> 01:57:37.281
LAURA: Hell yeah I do!

01:57:37.281 --> 01:57:39.037
MATT: Zahra, it's your go.

01:57:39.037 --> 01:57:42.327
MARY: All right. Is that an orc right behind me?

01:57:42.327 --> 01:57:44.693
MATT: This is Vex right there.

01:57:44.693 --> 01:57:46.094
LAURA: That's me.

01:57:46.094 --> 01:57:47.645
MARY: No, I can't see where I am.

01:57:47.645 --> 01:57:49.208
MATT: You're right here.

01:57:49.208 --> 01:57:52.199
MARY: Okay. Who are the three strongest orcs right
now?

01:57:52.199 --> 01:57:57.577
MATT: This one and these two here all look pretty
untouched. This one is actually untouched. Four.

01:57:57.577 --> 01:57:59.533
One, two, three, four.

01:57:59.533 --> 01:58:02.623
MARY: And I can only Hex one creature, is this
correct?

01:58:02.696 --> 01:58:03.991
MATT: Correct.

01:58:03.991 --> 01:58:10.532
MARY: All right. I'm going to Hex the one by-- in
the back, sorry. I'm going to Hex him.

01:58:10.532 --> 01:58:12.099
MATT: Him? All right.

01:58:12.099 --> 01:58:21.647
MARY: And I'm going to incant Agonizing Blast, and
cast Eldritch Blast on those three orcs.

01:58:21.647 --> 01:58:23.244
SAM: I've never heard of any of these things.

01:58:23.244 --> 01:58:25.432
MARY: Because there's three blasts that come from,
yeah?

01:58:25.432 --> 01:58:28.445
MATT: Well, Eldritch Blast is three different
beams, and that's just Eldritch Blast for your

01:58:28.445 --> 01:58:30.534
turn. Or you can do Agonizing Blast, you choose
one or the other.

01:58:30.534 --> 01:58:32.746
MARY: Oh, I thought Agonizing Blast was a--

01:58:32.746 --> 01:58:34.212
LAURA: Cantrip?

01:58:34.212 --> 01:58:35.644
MATT: Oh. It's one of your abilities?

01:58:35.644 --> 01:58:36.550
MARY: Yes.

01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:37.804
MATT: Oh, it just improves the Eldritch Blast?

01:58:37.804 --> 01:58:38.606
MARY: Yeah.

01:58:38.606 --> 01:58:39.739
MATT: Oh yeah, you can totally do that.

01:58:39.739 --> 01:58:40.768
MARY: I want to do that.

01:58:40.768 --> 01:58:41.771
MATT: Okay, so you turn around--

01:58:41.771 --> 01:58:43.762
MARY: I'd like to do that with my Staff of
Dragons.

01:58:43.762 --> 01:58:47.577
MATT: You hold the staff forward and for a second
your eyes, which are normally a vibrant bright

01:58:47.577 --> 01:58:54.234
white suddenly close with this darkness and then
reveal a pale blue like the moon in the sky. As

01:58:54.234 --> 01:59:00.397
you do, this hue of light blue energy begins to
emanate from this orc right there. He looks down

01:59:00.397 --> 01:59:06.150
confused as you pull your staff up and slam the
ground with it. As you do, these three streaks of

01:59:06.150 --> 01:59:09.182
pale, blueish green energy streak out towards it.

01:59:09.182 --> 01:59:10.089
MARY: Ha!

01:59:10.089 --> 01:59:12.043
MATT: Go ahead and roll three attacks.

01:59:12.043 --> 01:59:13.321
MARY: Oh my god.

01:59:13.321 --> 01:59:16.146
MATT: Adding your bonus-- your spell bonus to each
one.

01:59:16.146 --> 01:59:18.764
MARY: 13 plus 11.

01:59:18.764 --> 01:59:20.488
LAURA: So 24.

01:59:20.488 --> 01:59:21.548
MARY: 24.

01:59:21.548 --> 01:59:22.856
MATT: That hits.

01:59:22.856 --> 01:59:26.610
MARY: That was a good one. 30.

01:59:26.610 --> 01:59:28.150
MATT: 30. Okay.

01:59:28.150 --> 01:59:29.226
SAM: What?

01:59:29.226 --> 01:59:30.692
MARY: And 21.

01:59:30.692 --> 01:59:32.150
MATT: Are you adding the plus--

01:59:32.150 --> 01:59:34.292
MARY: Oh and plus two to each of them.

01:59:34.292 --> 01:59:35.946
LAURA: That's damage.

01:59:35.946 --> 01:59:40.783
MARY: Oh, I'm sorry. So it's Eldritch Blast, it
gets plus 11.

01:59:40.841 --> 01:59:43.442
MATT: Right. So what was the last one?

01:59:43.442 --> 01:59:44.991
MARY: 21.

01:59:44.991 --> 01:59:49.118
MATT: They all hit, so go ahead and roll damage
for each, and each does additional Hex damage,

01:59:49.118 --> 01:59:51.005
because it's three different hits.

01:59:51.005 --> 01:59:54.302
MARY: Yes. And the damage is 1d10 plus seven times
three?

01:59:54.302 --> 01:59:57.040
SAM: Too much math.

01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:00.428
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll that three times.
1d10 plus seven, 1d10 plus seven,

02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:01.570
1d10 plus seven.

02:00:01.570 --> 02:00:03.370
MARY: Okay. Oh, help me.

02:00:03.370 --> 02:00:06.729
LAURA: That's not a d10, that's a d12.

02:00:06.729 --> 02:00:08.037
MARY: Sorry. Sorry!

02:00:08.037 --> 02:00:08.906
MATT: It's all right.

02:00:08.906 --> 02:00:10.013
SAM: She's a guest.

02:00:10.013 --> 02:00:11.588
MARY: I'm a guest.

02:00:11.588 --> 02:00:14.335
LAURA: Oh, you know what, I was rolling eights
instead of tens. That's okay.

02:00:14.498 --> 02:00:16.385
MATT: Too late now. Next time.

02:00:16.385 --> 02:00:20.341
MARY: Two plus seven. Two plus seven is ten.

02:00:20.486 --> 02:00:21.554
SAM: Nine. Nine.

02:00:21.554 --> 02:00:22.682
MATT: All right.

02:00:22.682 --> 02:00:24.421
MARY: Two plus seven is nine, thank you.

02:00:24.421 --> 02:00:25.483
LAURA: Ten.

02:00:25.483 --> 02:00:27.207
MARY: Ten plus seven is 17.

02:00:27.207 --> 02:00:28.181
MATT: All right.

02:00:28.181 --> 02:00:31.219
MARY: And five plus seven is--

02:00:31.219 --> 02:00:32.071
TRAVIS: 12.

02:00:32.071 --> 02:00:32.875
MARY: 12.

02:00:32.875 --> 02:00:35.929
MATT: 12. And then then add-- roll a d6 three
times because each time you blast them you do the

02:00:35.929 --> 02:00:37.585
additional Hex damage.

02:00:37.585 --> 02:00:39.392
TRAVIS: Holy crap what are you?

02:00:39.392 --> 02:00:40.506
MARY: Two.

02:00:40.506 --> 02:00:41.595
MATT: All right two.

02:00:41.595 --> 02:00:43.377
MARY: Six.

02:00:43.377 --> 02:00:44.556
LAURA: Fuck.

02:00:44.556 --> 02:00:45.787
MATT: Eight total.

02:00:45.787 --> 02:00:46.722
MARY: Five.

02:00:46.722 --> 02:00:47.570
TRAVIS: Whoa!

02:00:47.570 --> 02:00:48.772
MATT: 13.

02:00:48.772 --> 02:00:50.469
LAURA: It's like a Hunter's Mark all on your
own.

02:00:50.469 --> 02:00:56.835
MATT: So, after the beams streak out-- all three
blast simultaneously into the torso area of the

02:00:56.880 --> 02:01:00.597
orc that's standing by Percy. It's glaring at you
with this look of surprise, and fury, and

02:01:00.597 --> 02:01:04.819
frustration and before it can even try and mount
any sort of attack, the three beams strike it in

02:01:04.819 --> 02:01:12.943
the chest. You can see this scattering of brackish
liquid as the back of its torso is blown out like

02:01:12.943 --> 02:01:14.197
a shotgun blast.

02:01:14.197 --> 02:01:15.497
MARY: Yes!

02:01:15.497 --> 02:01:20.632
MATT: And it falls to the ground with
this gurgle in its throat, and for a second you

02:01:20.632 --> 02:01:27.542
swear you see the glistening moonlight colored
energy that you had Hexed upon it almost sucks the

02:01:27.542 --> 02:01:31.392
soul from its body and then it dissipates into the
air above it.

02:01:31.392 --> 02:01:35.550
MARY: Thaumaturgy makes my eyes go fire.

02:01:35.550 --> 02:01:37.821
(laughter)

02:01:37.821 --> 02:01:38.804
SAM: Wow.

02:01:38.804 --> 02:01:45.882
MATT: A big blast of flame. Great. So that will
end your turn there.

02:01:45.882 --> 02:01:47.811
TRAVIS: You did really well.

02:01:47.811 --> 02:01:49.331
LAURA: How is she so cool?

02:01:49.331 --> 02:01:52.066
SAM: She just changed the game.

02:01:52.066 --> 02:01:55.484
MATT: That will bring us to Lyra.

02:01:55.484 --> 02:01:56.712
TRAVIS: She can stay.

02:01:56.712 --> 02:01:58.413
FELICIA: Is that 30 feet?

02:01:58.413 --> 02:02:03.203
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. 30 foot is right
there. From you.

02:02:03.203 --> 02:02:05.978
FELICIA: Who are the bad guys? This one, this one,
and this one?

02:02:05.978 --> 02:02:08.138
MATT: This one, this one, and these two there.

02:02:08.138 --> 02:02:13.465
FELICIA: Okay. So I'm like-- (screams) Oh, that
was cool. Okay. (pff) And I use my Chain

02:02:13.465 --> 02:02:22.914
Lightning. You have to do a save on that. That
just automatically hits.

02:02:22.914 --> 02:02:24.296
MATT: That just hits, yeah.

02:02:24.296 --> 02:02:25.910
FELICIA: Okay, so it's 10d8.

02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:26.901
SAM: To whom?

02:02:26.901 --> 02:02:29.891
FELICIA: To one guy, and then it can hit up to
three people within 30 feet.

02:02:29.891 --> 02:02:32.198
SAM: Are they within 30 feet?

02:02:32.198 --> 02:02:34.456
MATT: These two are not but this guy is.

02:02:34.456 --> 02:02:50.811
FELICIA: Ten, is 21. Plus 21 plus 24. 21 plus 24
is-

02:02:50.811 --> 02:02:51.959
SAM: 45.

02:02:51.959 --> 02:02:54.789
FELICIA: 45 points of damage to that guy, and then
it goes to the other guy.

02:02:54.789 --> 02:02:59.557
MATT: This guy there. These guys are a little
too far away, unfortunately. This guy is not.

02:02:59.608 --> 02:03:01.075
FELICIA: Oh, okay. Get that guy.

02:03:01.130 --> 02:03:05.780
MATT: As you freak out you back up and as an
instinctual maneuver you put your fingers out, and

02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:14.963
there is a loud crackling sound as a condensed
thunderstorm blasts forth from Lyra's hands. The

02:03:14.963 --> 02:03:20.640
orc that's threatening her and actually managed to
try and strike you gives you this look of sudden

02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:26.134
pity before its entire upper body is fried
instantly from the electricity that just

02:03:26.134 --> 02:03:30.887
destroys-- You can see all its flesh is now curled
back and cracking from the sheer amount of energy

02:03:30.887 --> 02:03:34.850
that's flowing through it. The bolt then streaks
off and slams the one that you dominated that was

02:03:34.850 --> 02:03:41.769
currently running in the other direction-- all of
a sudden gets hit in the side. However, maintains

02:03:41.769 --> 02:03:43.093
the Domination.

02:03:43.093 --> 02:03:44.674
(laughter)

02:03:44.674 --> 02:03:48.930
MATT: He did take half damage to that one. But
this one is blown off the map. The other one over

02:03:48.930 --> 02:03:52.916
here is looking pretty rough now. It's
hobbling forward currently with

02:03:52.916 --> 02:03:54.399
one of its legs ruined.

02:03:54.399 --> 02:03:57.515
LAURA: (laughs) That poor orc!

02:03:57.515 --> 02:04:01.301
MATT: It's pretty rough. It's been a rough day for
him. Do you want to stay where you are or do you

02:04:01.301 --> 02:04:02.851
want to move?

02:04:02.851 --> 02:04:04.979
FELICIA: I'll stay where I am. Wow, that worked!

02:04:04.979 --> 02:04:06.371
SAM: Wow, that was amazing!

02:04:06.371 --> 02:04:10.485
I turn around and sort of barf because I just
saw a guy's upper half get incinerated.

02:04:10.533 --> 02:04:12.764
(laughter)

02:04:12.764 --> 02:04:15.345
MARY: Suck it up, Scanlan.

02:04:15.404 --> 02:04:17.932
MATT: All right. Top of the round. Percy, Grog.

02:04:17.932 --> 02:04:23.021
TALIESIN: You first or I? I'm going to start
running towards Grog.

02:04:23.021 --> 02:04:24.349
MATT: Okay.

02:04:24.349 --> 02:04:30.308
TALIESIN: How far can I get? About that far. And
while I'm running I'm just going to take-- Oh

02:04:30.308 --> 02:04:34.703
hello, where are we? There we are. I'm just going
to take two pot shots at him as I'm running by.

02:04:34.703 --> 02:04:37.397
SAM: My dominated guy is not going to live to see
his--

02:04:37.397 --> 02:04:42.718
TALIESIN: And just because I don't really care I'm
going to take the negative-- the Sharpshooter plus

02:04:42.718 --> 02:04:44.767
damage negative to that. So.

02:04:44.811 --> 02:04:46.238
MATT: Okay.

02:04:46.238 --> 02:04:49.920
TALIESIN: 16.

02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:51.817
MATT: 16 does hit.

02:04:51.817 --> 02:04:56.161
TALIESIN: And I'll just do both right now. And--

02:04:56.161 --> 02:04:58.393
FELICIA: Oh my god!

02:04:58.393 --> 02:04:59.569
LAURA: Did you get another 20?

02:04:59.569 --> 02:05:00.481
FELICIA: Yes!

02:05:00.481 --> 02:05:01.481
TALIESIN: I got another 20!

02:05:01.481 --> 02:05:03.292
FELICIA: That's a very good dice. That's a very
good die.

02:05:03.292 --> 02:05:05.427
TRAVIS: You can spread them out over several
games. You don't have to--

02:05:05.427 --> 02:05:07.796
LAURA: We have to fight dragons soon. A dragon.

02:05:07.796 --> 02:05:13.620
TALIESIN: Thank you. This is phenomenal, I know.
I've got such terrible things that are going to

02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:17.630
happen to me because of all this good luck. So
that's-- I'll do the first one really quickly.

02:05:17.630 --> 02:05:23.420
That's 20 points of damage for the first shot.

02:05:23.420 --> 02:05:27.431
TRAVIS: Leave none alive, my boy.

02:05:27.431 --> 02:05:33.501
MATT: First shot smacks into its thigh, and you
can see where once there was an actual functional

02:05:33.558 --> 02:05:41.806
thigh area is now a splintered femur that is
exposed through one side of his leg. You can see

02:05:41.806 --> 02:05:46.865
it's barely keeping itself standing. It roars out
(raaah!) in pain as you fire again--

02:05:46.865 --> 02:05:49.287
TALIESIN: 32 points.

02:05:49.287 --> 02:05:54.825
MATT: With the final bullet in your Pepperbox's
chamber, the sixth bullet,

02:05:54.825 --> 02:05:57.073
you fire the last round--

02:05:57.073 --> 02:06:00.189
TALIESIN: You're going to make me change the
Sharpshooter thing by the

02:06:00.189 --> 02:06:01.935
end of this round I get the--

02:06:01.935 --> 02:06:04.011
MATT: No, no, no. Sharpshooter works well for a
reason.

02:06:04.011 --> 02:06:06.982
TALIESIN: It's kind of spectacular. I keep rolling
20s! I keep rolling 20s!

02:06:06.982 --> 02:06:10.127
MATT: That's what the dice does, man. It's worked
poorly in your favor before.

02:06:10.127 --> 02:06:11.983
TALIESIN: Really poorly, normally!

02:06:11.983 --> 02:06:17.988
MATT: It's great when it works awesomely. So with
this look of confusion as this orc that's trying

02:06:17.988 --> 02:06:20.178
to do the bidding of this gnome that--

02:06:20.178 --> 02:06:22.131
SAM: Protect our goliath!

02:06:22.131 --> 02:06:25.875
MATT: It's trying desperately to go and protect
Grog but on the way there it gets its leg blown

02:06:25.875 --> 02:06:30.975
out, and then suddenly it turns and the shot
enters one side of its temple and out the other

02:06:30.975 --> 02:06:38.997
and there's just this very quick (shpt) sound as
it falls to the ground motionless and is no longer

02:06:38.997 --> 02:06:40.262
a living organism.

02:06:40.262 --> 02:06:43.286
SAM: Good job Percy. I sort of had that guy
covered but it's all good. It's all good.

02:06:43.286 --> 02:06:44.570
TALIESIN: I'm coming, Grog!

02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:46.715
MATT: Grog, you're up.

02:06:46.715 --> 02:06:51.542
TRAVIS: For the gentleman that I'm facing right
now, I would like to take my first swing.

02:06:51.542 --> 02:06:53.479
MATT: All right.

02:06:53.479 --> 02:06:55.935
TRAVIS: Well all right, 24.

02:06:55.935 --> 02:06:57.722
MATT: 24. That hits.

02:06:57.722 --> 02:07:01.569
TRAVIS: And that is 19 points of damage.

02:07:01.569 --> 02:07:03.373
MATT: Whew. All right.

02:07:03.373 --> 02:07:05.523
TRAVIS: I'll take my second swing at him.

02:07:05.523 --> 02:07:06.257
MATT: Same guy?

02:07:06.257 --> 02:07:07.167
TRAVIS: Same guy.

02:07:07.167 --> 02:07:08.955
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for that.

02:07:08.955 --> 02:07:10.264
TRAVIS: 26.

02:07:10.264 --> 02:07:11.500
MATT: That hits.

02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:15.347
TRAVIS: (laughs) Also 19 points of damage.

02:07:15.347 --> 02:07:21.077
MARY: After the Hammer, orcs are nothing.

02:07:21.077 --> 02:07:27.587
MATT: So, the first strike you slam into his upper
torso area and it actually digs about four or five

02:07:27.587 --> 02:07:34.183
inches in. He reaches up and grabs-- drops his
weapon and grabs the axe and tries to pull it out

02:07:34.183 --> 02:07:40.941
of his body. You, however, reach up with your fist
and slam it down on the axe shoving it about five

02:07:40.941 --> 02:07:47.938
or six more inches. You can see his actual
shoulder and arm fall away from his torso as his

02:07:47.938 --> 02:07:50.543
eyes roll back and he falls limp against the
blade.

02:07:50.543 --> 02:07:57.992
TRAVIS: With my third attack, I'd like to turn to
his friend, grab him by the throat and go-- It's

02:07:57.992 --> 02:08:03.029
death, or target practice for my friends. Talk.

02:08:03.029 --> 02:08:07.225
MATT: Go ahead and make an intimidation roll.

02:08:07.225 --> 02:08:10.078
TRAVIS: Yay. 19.

02:08:10.078 --> 02:08:20.446
MATT: All right. The orc, looking at its current
fate and the rather rapid destruction of its

02:08:20.446 --> 02:08:27.328
entire band-- (speaks Orcish) Anyone here
speak Orcish?

02:08:27.328 --> 02:08:31.366
MARY: I speak Orc. So, my friend--

02:08:31.366 --> 02:08:33.483
LAURA: What did he say? What did he say?

02:08:33.483 --> 02:08:44.229
MATT: You hear him say, "Death may come, but the
rest will find you. You come into our wood. It's

02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:47.241
"only a matter of time before you're eaten."

02:08:47.241 --> 02:08:51.365
LAURA: Tell him we're just passing through.

02:08:51.365 --> 02:08:59.163
MARY: We are simply passing through. We are in
search of something. If you choose to help us, we

02:08:59.163 --> 02:09:00.987
may let you live.

02:09:00.987 --> 02:09:02.739
TRAVIS: Yeah, 'may'.

02:09:02.739 --> 02:09:08.275
MARY: And it is not one of yours.

02:09:08.275 --> 02:09:11.240
MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion roll.

02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:12.444
MARY: What do I roll?

02:09:12.444 --> 02:09:13.979
TRAVIS: 20.

02:09:13.979 --> 02:09:15.177
MARY: What do I add to it?

02:09:15.177 --> 02:09:16.642
SAM: Plus your persuasion.

02:09:16.642 --> 02:09:18.026
TRAVIS: Nine.

02:09:18.175 --> 02:09:19.294
LAURA: Heck yeah!

02:09:19.294 --> 02:09:20.731
MARY: 24!

02:09:20.731 --> 02:09:22.325
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:09:22.325 --> 02:09:26.194
MATT: As you're speaking to him in his own
language, his--

02:09:26.194 --> 02:09:28.633
MARY: (speaks Orcish)

02:09:28.633 --> 02:09:30.070
TRAVIS: Bless you.

02:09:30.070 --> 02:09:32.187
MATT: (laughs) You guys hear these horrible
guttural sounds, almost as

02:09:32.187 --> 02:09:34.215
good as Keyleth's Giant.

02:09:34.215 --> 02:09:35.401
TRAVIS: Almost.

02:09:35.401 --> 02:09:39.870
MATT: Almost. You can see a look of fear and his
eyes dart about the rest of the party as they all

02:09:39.870 --> 02:09:45.038
begin stepping out of the firelight and into the
darkness surrounding him. He gauges the scenario.

02:09:45.038 --> 02:09:50.200
Looks down at the dead dire wolf. He gives you
another look and you still have the flaring blaze

02:09:50.200 --> 02:10:02.803
of your angry Thaumaturgy eyes. He says in Common,
very broken Common-- "Very well. I live. I serve."

02:10:02.849 --> 02:10:08.713
You can see his blood now trickling down to the
corner of his mouth.

02:10:08.713 --> 02:10:10.697
LAURA: What, is he going to fight with us?

02:10:10.697 --> 02:10:12.317
FELICIA: Can I see if he's truthful? Insight?

02:10:12.372 --> 02:10:14.010
MATT: Make an insight check.

02:10:14.010 --> 02:10:15.433
FELICIA: Aw, that's not my strength.

02:10:15.433 --> 02:10:16.732
MATT: You can certainly try, though!

02:10:16.732 --> 02:10:18.958
FELICIA: Oh good, I rolled a four!

02:10:18.958 --> 02:10:19.771
SAM: Plus two!

02:10:19.771 --> 02:10:20.833
FELICIA: Plus two!

02:10:20.833 --> 02:10:22.060
MARY: That's a six.

02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:29.055
MATT: He looks.... constipated? That's the best
way you can read it.

02:10:29.055 --> 02:10:30.476
LAURA: Can I try as well?

02:10:30.476 --> 02:10:31.788
MATT: You're welcome to.

02:10:31.788 --> 02:10:32.951
TRAVIS: Constipated?

02:10:32.951 --> 02:10:39.377
MATT: You're concerned, briefly, for the diet he 
usually eats. Vex, you wanna go ahead?

02:10:39.424 --> 02:10:41.520
LAURA: 16, is what I rolled.

02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:48.450
MATT: 16? Ah, there is definitely an intent for
self-preservation, but there is that

02:10:48.450 --> 02:10:50.807
fight-or-flight look in the eyes as well.

02:10:50.807 --> 02:10:52.157
TRAVIS: Let me kill him.

02:10:52.157 --> 02:10:54.230
LAURA: Well, let's find out about our dragon
first.

02:10:54.230 --> 02:10:56.672
FELICIA: Oh! I can cast Friend on him.

02:10:56.672 --> 02:11:00.299
MARY: No, because he'll know you're casting magic
and then he'll come back at you.

02:11:00.299 --> 02:11:01.610
LAURA: Will he?

02:11:01.610 --> 02:11:04.371
MATT: He will.

02:11:04.371 --> 02:11:06.615
FELICIA: Is that why it never worked on Aldor?

02:11:06.615 --> 02:11:10.059
MARY: Yes, and he'll come back and attack you
afterwards and it can only be used for--

02:11:10.059 --> 02:11:11.615
LAURA: How do you know?

02:11:11.615 --> 02:11:13.306
MARY: Friends! Well, I can cast Friends.

02:11:13.321 --> 02:11:16.403
MATT: Friends, however, has to be on something
that's not hostile, and you get the feeling that

02:11:16.403 --> 02:11:19.826
even though he's currently docile, he's probably a
little hostile.

02:11:19.826 --> 02:11:22.429
FELICIA: Okay, okay. I guess we'll just go
without.

02:11:22.429 --> 02:11:27.450
MARY: Suggestion only works-- but Mass Suggestion
works for a long time.

02:11:27.450 --> 02:11:29.123
LAURA: Why don't we just ask him?

02:11:29.123 --> 02:11:31.987
SAM: Yeah! We got him! We can kill him in a second
if we have to, so--

02:11:31.987 --> 02:11:33.576
MARY: You know we can kill you.

02:11:33.576 --> 02:11:35.495
LAURA: There's a dragon. Where is it?

02:11:35.495 --> 02:11:42.572
MARY: We are looking for a dragon. Specifically, a
white dragon, and we know it is to the north--

02:11:42.572 --> 02:11:43.885
SAM: West.

02:11:43.885 --> 02:11:45.185
MARY: -- west.

02:11:45.185 --> 02:11:57.287
MATT: "This beast, I see-- in the sky. Takes those
who do not hide. Look for the tallest mountain

02:11:57.287 --> 02:12:03.421
"that way." And points up the north area, a little
ways off the road and in the direction you're

02:12:03.421 --> 02:12:12.129
travelling. "It... takes refuge top of the
mountain. There is no path. Just hiding."

02:12:12.129 --> 02:12:14.399
MARY: How tall is the mountain?

02:12:14.399 --> 02:12:16.380
MATT: "High."

02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:20.969
LAURA: Do you know of a secret passageway to get
up to it?

02:12:20.969 --> 02:12:26.146
MATT: "Only fools would try to scale a dragon's
mountain."

02:12:26.146 --> 02:12:29.607
LAURA: Yeah, well we're pretty stupid. Do you know
of a path?

02:12:29.607 --> 02:12:36.111
MATT: He gives you a look of momentary
indifference and kind of... no.

02:12:36.111 --> 02:12:39.522
FELICIA: I don't believe him. I do not believe
him.

02:12:39.522 --> 02:12:40.632
SAM: He's giving you sass.

02:12:40.632 --> 02:12:42.314
LAURA: He is giving me sass!

02:12:42.314 --> 02:12:44.827
MARY: Yes. Can we-- what do we roll to--

02:12:44.827 --> 02:12:48.134
SAM: While they're talking, I'm going to loot the
other bodies.

02:12:48.134 --> 02:12:58.831
MATT: Okay. As you glance around the corpses, you
find not too much on them, though it looks like

02:12:58.831 --> 02:13:03.976
they've gathered from raiding other people they're
passing on the road, or just scavenging about. You

02:13:03.976 --> 02:13:05.847
find 274 gold.

02:13:05.847 --> 02:13:09.830
FELICIA: Vex, can you do your detect dragon?
Here?

02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:11.234
LAURA: I can actually!

02:13:11.234 --> 02:13:13.963
FELICIA: Because I'm not quite there, at a
thousand feet, but--

02:13:13.963 --> 02:13:19.758
LAURA: I can most definitely detect the dragon.
So, you're saying that we need to not be out in

02:13:19.758 --> 02:13:23.000
the open, because the dragon is attracted to
things that are not hidden?

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:23.935
MARY: Yes.

02:13:23.935 --> 02:13:28.473
MATT: "Hungry, it will take you. But that's your
choice."

02:13:28.473 --> 02:13:32.314
MARY: Have you ever seen it up close?

02:13:32.314 --> 02:13:33.707
MATT: "No."

02:13:33.707 --> 02:13:35.266
SAM: Would you like to?

02:13:35.266 --> 02:13:37.303
LAURA: You want to come with us?

02:13:37.303 --> 02:13:39.344
MATT: "No!"

02:13:39.344 --> 02:13:41.090
LAURA: Then stop giving us sass!

02:13:41.090 --> 02:13:51.404
MATT: "You say you'll keep me alive but you walk
towards death. One or the other way,

02:13:51.449 --> 02:13:53.075
"I end up at the bottom."

02:13:53.075 --> 02:13:54.974
MARY: We talk towards glory.

02:13:54.974 --> 02:13:59.554
LAURA: Did you see how fast we killed your
friends? We're pretty amazing.

02:13:59.554 --> 02:14:04.688
MATT: "Then go. Go and see your dragon."

02:14:04.688 --> 02:14:13.032
MARY: Do you know of any more information on this
dragon? That's all? Any weaknesses? Anything?

02:14:13.032 --> 02:14:20.456
MATT: He gives you a look like, he's on empty.
He's given you everything he's gonna give you.

02:14:20.456 --> 02:14:24.081
TRAVIS: Well, now you're on empty, I take my
greataxe and I chop off his head.

02:14:24.081 --> 02:14:25.511
ALL: Oh!

02:14:25.511 --> 02:14:27.384
TALIESIN: Guys...

02:14:27.384 --> 02:14:29.530
SAM: No. Wait. Stop.

02:14:29.530 --> 02:14:31.956
FELICIA: Now this is just not right!

02:14:31.956 --> 02:14:37.535
MATT: As the whole group gasps, Grog just shoves
him back and (whoosh whoom, pff pff). The head

02:14:37.579 --> 02:14:42.416
rolls, hits a patch of snow and stops. The body
falls back and you see kind of dark blood begin to

02:14:42.416 --> 02:14:44.836
pour out of the rest of the body and into the
snow.

02:14:44.836 --> 02:14:45.616
SAM: Grog.

02:14:45.616 --> 02:14:46.469
TRAVIS: What.

02:14:46.469 --> 02:14:48.537
SAM: You should have checked with our leader
before you did that.

02:14:48.537 --> 02:14:49.934
LAURA: Yes. Most definitely.

02:14:49.934 --> 02:14:52.679
FELICIA: Okay. I think we're going to have to have
a talk circle. Right now.

02:14:52.679 --> 02:14:58.767
MARY: Okay. Before that, do any of the orc have
any iron on them at all?

02:14:58.767 --> 02:15:03.659
MATT: Looking around, there are bits and pieces
of, whether it be iron weapons-- you can see,

02:15:03.659 --> 02:15:11.226
scavenged a few-- like some of the axes that were
being used have an iron or similar type metal that

02:15:11.385 --> 02:15:15.160
is crafted in those, though it's usually pretty
beaten and not very well maintained.

02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:18.635
MARY: It doesn't matter, I just want the iron.
Whatever I can, I--

02:15:18.635 --> 02:15:21.751
MATT: I'll say you can harvest the iron blades
from three axes.

02:15:21.751 --> 02:15:22.941
MARY: Thank you.

02:15:22.941 --> 02:15:25.791
MATT: They're in relatively poor condition, but
you can mark that.

02:15:25.791 --> 02:15:27.420
TRAVIS: Sorry, Lyra.

02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:28.883
SAM: All right. Are we doing a talk circle?

02:15:28.883 --> 02:15:33.898
FELICIA: I think we need to discuss the fact that
that was just very inappropriate and I am here as

02:15:33.898 --> 02:15:37.461
a leader and I think that that was just not right,
we are better than that.

02:15:37.461 --> 02:15:39.447
LAURA: We are. But here's the thing--

02:15:39.447 --> 02:15:40.865
SAM: You did kill one of them too, though.

02:15:40.865 --> 02:15:41.761
FELICIA: Yes--

02:15:41.761 --> 02:15:44.389
MARY: Lyra, we are going to kill-- we are on our
way to kill something.

02:15:44.389 --> 02:15:46.345
FELICIA: Well, it's-- we had a deal.

02:15:46.345 --> 02:15:49.490
LAURA: Well, he probably would've led his friends
to us to kill us.

02:15:49.490 --> 02:15:56.150
FELICIA: As a leader I choose not to pursue this
any more, but I will register my disapproval, and

02:15:56.150 --> 02:16:00.863
I think we should just proceed, I'm very, I'm very
vexed.

02:16:00.863 --> 02:16:02.896
TALIESIN: That's very fair, that's very fair.

02:16:02.896 --> 02:16:03.865
FELICIA: Thank you.

02:16:03.865 --> 02:16:05.223
MARY: Scanlan, can't you sing a song to make her
feel better.

02:16:05.223 --> 02:16:06.657
SAM: I could sing a song to make her feel better.

02:16:06.657 --> 02:16:08.222
MARY: But you don't want to.

02:16:08.222 --> 02:16:10.309
LAURA: (sings) Scanlan make you feel good.

02:16:10.309 --> 02:16:12.821
SAM: At least she's not talking about Aldor, so
I'm okay with it.

02:16:12.821 --> 02:16:15.394
FELICIA: Oh, did you want to, we haven't talked
yet.

02:16:15.394 --> 02:16:16.516
SAM: I-- we should go.

02:16:16.516 --> 02:16:18.104
TALIESIN: You should write a song about Aldor.

02:16:18.104 --> 02:16:20.719
TRAVIS: I go over and I pick up the orc's head and
I walk it over to Lyra and I go, here, I'm sorry,

02:16:20.719 --> 02:16:23.417
you can keep this. It won't happen without me
asking again.

02:16:23.463 --> 02:16:24.705
FELICIA: No, that's quite all right, it's--

02:16:24.705 --> 02:16:27.015
TRAVIS: No, really, look, it's still got stuff in
it.

02:16:27.015 --> 02:16:29.163
MATT: As he shakes it, you see spattering across
the--

02:16:29.163 --> 02:16:31.733
FELICIA: No, okay-- that's quite-- I think we
should just proceed-- we should proceed,

02:16:31.733 --> 02:16:32.827
everyone.

02:16:32.827 --> 02:16:36.326
LAURA: I'm gonna try to see if there's a dragon
within--

02:16:36.326 --> 02:16:37.947
TALIESIN: And I say we could just cut out the
tongue, it's not--

02:16:37.947 --> 02:16:39.013
TRAVIS: Just the tongue?

02:16:39.013 --> 02:16:39.967
TALIESIN: Like that yes, yes.

02:16:39.967 --> 02:16:41.121
TRAVIS: I rip the tongue out of the head.

02:16:41.121 --> 02:16:42.373
FELICIA: That's a good idea, Vex.

02:16:42.373 --> 02:16:43.481
MARY: Do we need the pelt of the dire wolf?

02:16:43.481 --> 02:16:46.186
TRAVIS: I put the orc tongue in the bag of
holding. And the orc head. Both.

02:16:46.186 --> 02:16:47.141
MARY: Just asking.

02:16:47.141 --> 02:16:48.377
MATT: All right.

02:16:48.377 --> 02:16:49.469
TALIESIN: With the lip, now we-- you're slowly--

02:16:49.469 --> 02:16:50.617
TRAVIS: The lip is in my belt, baby.

02:16:50.617 --> 02:16:52.891
MARY: And I would like to extract the canines from
the dire wolf.

02:16:52.891 --> 02:16:55.439
MATT: From the dire wolf, all right. I would like
you to go ahead and make a nature check.

02:16:55.439 --> 02:16:56.544
MARY: What's that?

02:16:56.544 --> 02:16:59.941
MATT: That's to attempt to harvest the creature's
canines.

02:16:59.941 --> 02:17:01.377
LAURA: What's that? Sorry?

02:17:01.377 --> 02:17:02.771
MARY: Sorry, what do I do?

02:17:02.905 --> 02:17:05.018
MATT: Roll a d20 and add your nature check bonus.

02:17:05.018 --> 02:17:06.059
MARY: Oh, that sucks.

02:17:06.059 --> 02:17:07.480
LAURA: Can I Primeval Awareness the dragon?

02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:08.521
MARY: 12.

02:17:08.521 --> 02:17:15.676
MATT: Okay. As you begin taking a small dagger out
from the inside of your Cloak of Useful Things you

02:17:15.676 --> 02:17:23.310
break one of the tooths in the
process, unfortunately. You manage to get one of

02:17:23.310 --> 02:17:27.877
them, at least, so you do have one dire wolf
canine you can add to your items.

02:17:27.877 --> 02:17:35.420
MARY: I would like to put my hands on the dire
wolf and just thank it, for no other reason than I

02:17:35.420 --> 02:17:37.027
respect its life.

02:17:37.027 --> 02:17:38.312
MATT: Very well.

02:17:38.312 --> 02:17:40.056
TALIESIN: I don't think he's going to answer.

02:17:40.056 --> 02:17:41.660
MARY: You know, it's not for you, Percy.

02:17:41.660 --> 02:17:43.030
TALIESIN: Oh well, I'm just saying.

02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:44.154
LAURA: The dragon, then.

02:17:44.154 --> 02:17:45.156
TALIESIN: I'm trying to be helpful.

02:17:45.156 --> 02:17:46.307
MARY: I understand.

02:17:46.307 --> 02:17:57.268
MATT: All right, you take a moment and concentrate
and, for a six mile radius-- currently no dragon.

02:17:57.268 --> 02:17:59.678
LAURA: Still? It's still-- oh right, it's towards
a mountain.

02:17:59.678 --> 02:18:02.859
SAM: We've got another day's travel, it's got to
be 20 miles away.

02:18:02.859 --> 02:18:05.723
TRAVIS: Should we keep sleeping, or should we just
pack it up now and go?

02:18:05.723 --> 02:18:06.867
SAM: Is it nighttime?

02:18:06.867 --> 02:18:08.634
MATT: It's still-- it's probably like a good two,
three in the morning.

02:18:08.634 --> 02:18:09.825
SAM: Oh, let's go back to bed.

02:18:09.825 --> 02:18:12.520
TRAVIS: Would you say a new day has passed? So can
I try for my beard again?

02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:15.147
MATT: We will once you get a full-on rest.

02:18:15.147 --> 02:18:16.151
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:18:16.151 --> 02:18:19.732
FELICIA: Let's fully rest. I'm going to make a
leadership decision that hopefully everybody

02:18:19.732 --> 02:18:21.969
agrees with that we need more sleepytime.

02:18:21.969 --> 02:18:26.168
LAURA: Is it okay to keep sleeping right here, are
they going to come search for us? Probably not

02:18:26.220 --> 02:18:27.362
more than one search party.

02:18:27.362 --> 02:18:28.208
TALIESIN: Probably not.

02:18:28.208 --> 02:18:29.120
FELICIA: Probably not.

02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:30.545
TALIESIN: I'm in my pyjamas, I'm going back to
bed.

02:18:30.545 --> 02:18:33.030
FELICIA: I think that's a good call that I agree
with as the leader of this group.

02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:33.807
TALIESIN: What she said.

02:18:33.807 --> 02:18:35.693
MARY: Are we always going to call it sleepytime?

02:18:35.693 --> 02:18:37.465
FELICIA: I mean, that's.

02:18:37.465 --> 02:18:41.730
MARY: I'm just asking, I like to put labels on
things. It's an OCD thing.

02:18:41.730 --> 02:18:46.416
FELICIA: Whatever you would like to call it. Or
just, yeah.

02:18:46.416 --> 02:18:47.996
MARY: No, you're the leader, I shall accept
whatever name--

02:18:47.996 --> 02:18:49.695
FELICIA: Yes, sleepytime is the official name for
it!

02:18:49.695 --> 02:18:51.397
(laughter)

02:18:51.397 --> 02:18:53.349
MARY: Sleepytime it is. Thank you so much.

02:18:53.349 --> 02:18:54.852
TALIESIN: I'm going to sleepytime, good night,
all.

02:18:54.852 --> 02:18:56.423
TRAVIS: Is it-- is it still my watch?

02:18:56.423 --> 02:18:57.521
MATT: It is.

02:18:57.521 --> 02:18:58.338
SAM: You did your job.

02:18:58.338 --> 02:18:59.266
FELICIA: You did your job.

02:18:59.266 --> 02:19:00.210
SAM: I'll take the next watch.

02:19:00.210 --> 02:19:01.489
TRAVIS: Thanks. (snores)

02:19:01.489 --> 02:19:02.721
MARY: May I?

02:19:02.721 --> 02:19:04.561
FELICIA: And we can heal up, right?

02:19:04.561 --> 02:19:08.519
MATT: Yes, so the rest of you guys, you go ahead
and take your full evening's rest, at which point

02:19:08.519 --> 02:19:13.046
your hit points and spells are restored. And Grog,
go ahead and make a percentage roll.

02:19:13.092 --> 02:19:18.724
TRAVIS: Yeah! Come on, you big bearded bastard!
58.

02:19:18.724 --> 02:19:21.332
MATT: 58, nah, unfortunately.

02:19:21.332 --> 02:19:26.109
MATT: But you've still got that nice scruff, a
good like, y'know, half an inch to an inch of

02:19:26.109 --> 02:19:29.902
whatever that is pushing through.

02:19:29.902 --> 02:19:32.663
TRAVIS: Dire wolf blood all over my feet didn't
stimulate the growth at all?

02:19:32.663 --> 02:19:33.730
MATT: Unfortunately no.

02:19:33.730 --> 02:19:34.744
TRAVIS: All right.

02:19:34.744 --> 02:19:36.190
MARY: That blood looked quite black.

02:19:36.190 --> 02:19:39.650
MATT: Eventually you all complete your evening's
rest, the rest of the watches go without incident,

02:19:39.650 --> 02:19:44.098
in the morning you wake up and the cold air was
pretty rough for a lot of you. Thankfully the fire

02:19:44.098 --> 02:19:50.576
was there to help, but you're-- you get the
feeling that the further north you travel, the

02:19:50.576 --> 02:19:56.214
weather's going to become an issue, even with the
warm clothing you currently have on. All right. So

02:19:56.214 --> 02:19:59.426
you guys step back to where your horses are
currently--

02:19:59.426 --> 02:20:01.105
LAURA: Oh. Our horses are okay?

02:20:01.105 --> 02:20:03.200
TRAVIS: Oh shit, we forgot about those.

02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:10.302
MATT: Thankfully, your horses were far enough away
from the area where you were, the focus was not to

02:20:10.302 --> 02:20:14.396
make any noise when they came upon you, so the
orcish party knew better than

02:20:14.396 --> 02:20:15.680
to attack the horses first.

02:20:15.680 --> 02:20:16.783
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

02:20:16.783 --> 02:20:19.663
MATT: The horses are still a little spooked from
the evening's events, but nevertheless. You get

02:20:19.663 --> 02:20:23.224
back on your horses, you continue up the Glasswalk
Road. You had a question?

02:20:23.224 --> 02:20:29.186
MARY: I use Beast Speech to calm them. Tell them 
everything shall be fine.

02:20:29.340 --> 02:20:31.108
TRAVIS: You have just got all sorts of shit.

02:20:31.108 --> 02:20:35.663
MARY: Everything will be wonderful and thank you
for leading us where we need to go. We shall try

02:20:35.663 --> 02:20:38.397
and make sure that no harm comes to you.

02:20:38.397 --> 02:20:41.411
MATT: And immediately with that, the horses who
were currently rattled, and some of them are being

02:20:41.411 --> 02:20:48.191
unresponsive to your attempts to mount them,
settle down, come to a calm point and allow you

02:20:48.191 --> 02:20:50.656
all to get atop them without an issue.

02:20:50.656 --> 02:20:53.007
TRAVIS: Being fully asleep, I cast fart.

02:20:53.007 --> 02:20:54.959
(laughter)

02:20:54.959 --> 02:20:57.300
MATT: All right.

02:20:57.300 --> 02:21:00.727
TALIESIN: The irony is, I was going to recommend
Dust of Tracelessness, but that works too.

02:21:00.727 --> 02:21:01.918
LAURA: Oh, that works too. Can you--

02:21:01.918 --> 02:21:03.407
TALIESIN: They would never follow that, so.

02:21:03.407 --> 02:21:05.609
MATT: Dust of-- Cloud of Deterrence.

02:21:05.609 --> 02:21:07.307
TALIESIN: Cloud of Deterrence, thank you.

02:21:07.307 --> 02:21:10.815
MARY: What do you want to do, my love. Dear.
Whoever you are.

02:21:10.815 --> 02:21:14.156
LAURA: Oh yes, Dust of Tracelessness. He's got
this stuff, we can cover our tracks.

02:21:14.156 --> 02:21:15.238
TRAVIS: Should we sleep?

02:21:15.238 --> 02:21:16.596
FELICIA: We slept already, we're on the horses.

02:21:16.596 --> 02:21:18.126
SAM: It's the next day.

02:21:18.126 --> 02:21:19.103
TRAVIS: Oh, it is?

02:21:19.103 --> 02:21:20.155
LAURA: Yeah.

02:21:20.155 --> 02:21:21.471
TRAVIS: Oh. We ride.

02:21:21.471 --> 02:21:22.505
SAM: We ride!

02:21:22.505 --> 02:21:23.528
MARY: And so we ride!

02:21:23.528 --> 02:21:26.138
TRAVIS: And I take the Dust of Tracelessness and
I, in the back.

02:21:26.138 --> 02:21:28.083
SAM: Do we ever run out of that stuff?

02:21:28.083 --> 02:21:28.976
LAURA: Never.

02:21:28.976 --> 02:21:30.382
TRAVIS: No, it's an infinite supply.

02:21:30.382 --> 02:21:31.235
SAM: Wow.

02:21:31.235 --> 02:21:32.334
FELICIA: That is very convenient.

02:21:32.334 --> 02:21:33.861
TRAVIS: Yeah, it is, it's really nice.

02:21:33.861 --> 02:21:38.068
MATT: (laughs) And so as you're on your warhorse,
which, as you can tell the more and more you ride

02:21:38.068 --> 02:21:42.832
on it the more and more it's starting to slow.
Thankfully you're keeping pace with Trinket, it's

02:21:42.832 --> 02:21:45.684
having a hard time keeping a goliath on its back
for extensive riding.

02:21:45.684 --> 02:21:48.822
TRAVIS: Could I give it-- could I give it a health
potion?

02:21:48.822 --> 02:21:53.703
MATT: Let's just say it's probably going to be a
little sway-backed by the end of this adventure.

02:21:53.703 --> 02:21:55.168
LAURA: Oh, poor thing.

02:21:55.168 --> 02:21:56.738
FELICIA: Poor little horsie.

02:21:56.738 --> 02:21:58.403
MARY: It may need to ride you.

02:21:58.403 --> 02:21:59.462
MATT: It's okay for now.

02:21:59.462 --> 02:22:01.156
TALIESIN: At some point you should give it a break
with the carpet.

02:22:01.156 --> 02:22:01.949
LAURA: Yeah.

02:22:01.949 --> 02:22:03.182
TRAVIS: I can't ride the carpet.

02:22:03.182 --> 02:22:04.181
SAM: We don't have the carpet.

02:22:04.181 --> 02:22:05.057
LAURA: Why did we--

02:22:05.057 --> 02:22:05.864
SAM: Do we have the carpet?

02:22:05.864 --> 02:22:07.129
TRAVIS: We gave the carpet to them.

02:22:07.129 --> 02:22:09.347
LAURA: The other team has the carpet? Those
bastards.

02:22:09.347 --> 02:22:10.865
FELICIA: I don't know them, but that's very-- that
is upsetting.

02:22:10.865 --> 02:22:12.138
TRAVIS: Yeah. That is.

02:22:12.138 --> 02:22:14.125
MATT: You guys continue traveling for a second
day--

02:22:14.125 --> 02:22:16.903
LAURA: Why? Because Tiberius can fly, why the hell
did we give them the carpet?

02:22:16.903 --> 02:22:18.586
(laughter)

02:22:18.586 --> 02:22:20.652
LAURA: Sorry.

02:22:20.652 --> 02:22:22.003
MARY: Oh.

02:22:22.003 --> 02:22:24.829
SAM: It's all right, we don't need the crutch.

02:22:24.829 --> 02:22:26.132
LAURA: All right.

02:22:26.132 --> 02:22:27.079
TRAVIS: Second day.

02:22:27.079 --> 02:22:28.053
SAM: We're fine.

02:22:28.053 --> 02:22:29.093
MARY: Day two.

02:22:29.093 --> 02:22:32.022
FELICIA: And so anyway, so, when I first met
Aldor--

02:22:32.022 --> 02:22:32.888
SAM: Uh-huh.

02:22:32.888 --> 02:22:37.576
FELICIA: -- he was hired to be my bodyguard and it
was so obvious that he was so capable when he

02:22:37.639 --> 02:22:38.837
walked in the room--

02:22:38.837 --> 02:22:41.984
SAM: How did he react when you first told him of
your feelings?

02:22:41.984 --> 02:22:47.085
FELICIA: I mean, it was not a good evening, but he
was paid to be there so he couldn't leave, so that

02:22:47.085 --> 02:22:48.482
was, well, that was good for me--

02:22:48.482 --> 02:22:49.865
SAM: Always works for me.

02:22:49.865 --> 02:22:51.788
FELICIA: It's not, it didn't work today, but it
could work tomorrow or the day after.

02:22:51.788 --> 02:22:53.447
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Can we make an agreement. I
kill you, you kill me?

02:22:53.447 --> 02:22:54.395
MARY: Yes.

02:22:54.395 --> 02:22:56.243
FELICIA: And suddenly he disappears, it's so funny
that--

02:22:56.243 --> 02:22:57.508
SAM: Well, you-- men are complicated.

02:22:57.508 --> 02:22:59.609
MATT: A few hours of-- a few hours of travel
and--

02:22:59.609 --> 02:23:01.135
MARY: Percy, any extra guns?

02:23:01.135 --> 02:23:02.084
TALIESIN: What?

02:23:02.084 --> 02:23:03.136
MARY: Sorry.

02:23:03.136 --> 02:23:11.056
MATT: Learning the ins and outs of the extremely
tumultuous history of Lyra and Aldor, you

02:23:11.056 --> 02:23:15.917
eventually come to a point where the clouds are
beginning to darken, and in the distance you can

02:23:15.917 --> 02:23:23.850
see what looks like a very heavily obscured
curtain of snowfall to the north-northwest. You

02:23:23.850 --> 02:23:31.973
get to a point of the Glasswalk Road where a
snowstorm is starting to pour over this vicinity.

02:23:31.973 --> 02:23:41.835
You guys stop for a second and repackage yourself
with your fur and heavy winter clothing, and even

02:23:41.835 --> 02:23:45.214
still it's very, very chilly. I'd like everybody
to make a constitution save.

02:23:45.214 --> 02:23:47.480
LAURA: Are we still in the forest?

02:23:47.480 --> 02:23:52.155
MATT: You are nearing forest, yes. So yeah, you
would be considered in forest area.

02:23:52.155 --> 02:23:53.371
LAURA: Okay.

02:23:53.371 --> 02:23:56.603
TRAVIS: Aren't I good like above 20,000 feet in
really, really cold environments?

02:23:56.603 --> 02:23:58.586
MATT: Yes, you have advantage on this.

02:23:58.586 --> 02:24:01.800
LAURA: Natural 20! Sorry, that was my first one.

02:24:01.800 --> 02:24:03.261
FELICIA: You're so warm.

02:24:03.261 --> 02:24:04.381
MATT: (laughs) So warm.

02:24:04.381 --> 02:24:06.046
LAURA: It's bad thing to roll a natural 20 on.

02:24:06.046 --> 02:24:07.873
TALIESIN: We're cuddling you for warmth,
apparently. You're like an oven.

02:24:07.873 --> 02:24:09.014
LAURA: It's Trinket, you know.

02:24:09.014 --> 02:24:09.961
MARY: 15.

02:24:09.961 --> 02:24:11.048
MATT: All right.

02:24:11.048 --> 02:24:12.460
FELICIA: 20.

02:24:12.460 --> 02:24:13.643
SAM: Four.

02:24:13.643 --> 02:24:14.525
TALIESIN: 24.

02:24:14.525 --> 02:24:16.382
SAM: Hey, that adds up.

02:24:16.382 --> 02:24:18.329
TRAVIS: Is this a constitution saving throw or
just a modifier?

02:24:18.329 --> 02:24:20.574
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw, so you
roll twice and take the higher.

02:24:20.574 --> 02:24:22.096
TRAVIS: Oh, wow. 23.

02:24:22.096 --> 02:24:24.734
MATT: I think, I'm pretty sure that's how that
works. I'll check here with the goliath as the

02:24:24.734 --> 02:24:28.472
mountain-born-- oh, you're just naturally adapted
to it, so you're fine.

02:24:28.472 --> 02:24:33.716
TRAVIS: (laughs) I've got my chest out, my nipples
aren't even getting hard. It's amazing.

02:24:33.716 --> 02:24:38.462
TALIESIN: Oddly, your face is a bit cold because
it's so bare.

02:24:38.462 --> 02:24:43.109
TRAVIS: Your instinct-- that was a low blow. That
was a low blow.

02:24:43.153 --> 02:24:47.996
MATT: All right, so all of you manage-- Scanlan,
mark yourself, you have one level of fatigue.

02:24:47.996 --> 02:24:49.297
LAURA and MARY: Oh no.

02:24:49.297 --> 02:24:51.109
SAM: What's that mean, what's that mean?

02:24:51.109 --> 02:24:52.703
MATT: Fatigue, let me go ahead and make sure--

02:24:52.703 --> 02:24:54.465
MARY: Too much listening to-- oh, sorry.

02:24:54.465 --> 02:24:58.485
FELICIA: Does he look cold? I'm going to give him
my stone, I'm going to give him my stone of

02:24:58.485 --> 02:24:59.479
resisting cold.

02:24:59.479 --> 02:25:01.062
TRAVIS: That was bullshit, Percy.

02:25:01.062 --> 02:25:02.117
SAM: What about you?

02:25:02.117 --> 02:25:04.569
FELICIA: It's okay. I'm a leader, and a leader
sacrifices--

02:25:04.569 --> 02:25:06.006
SAM: I can't let you do that, Lyra.

02:25:06.006 --> 02:25:10.233
FELICIA: No, really, just take it. You listened to
me so good. It's like we're besties.

02:25:10.233 --> 02:25:14.610
SAM: I feel-- I feel a connection, I do. You know
when you were telling me about Aldor--

02:25:14.610 --> 02:25:15.746
FELICIA: It's not sexual at all.

02:25:15.746 --> 02:25:16.665
SAM: No-- I-- uh.

02:25:16.665 --> 02:25:18.969
FELICIA: I'm not attracted to you at all, like
literally if it happened I would be ill, but it's

02:25:18.969 --> 02:25:20.046
really nice--

02:25:20.046 --> 02:25:23.192
SAM: Believe me, you sexually? You repulse me.

02:25:23.192 --> 02:25:24.111
FELICIA: Thank you!

02:25:24.111 --> 02:25:25.211
SAM: Yeah, no, really.

02:25:25.211 --> 02:25:26.428
FELICIA: Oh my god, I'm so with you right there.

02:25:26.428 --> 02:25:27.309
SAM: Oh yeah.

02:25:27.309 --> 02:25:28.476
FELICIA: But really, as a friend you are so nice.

02:25:28.476 --> 02:25:29.568
SAM: I feel a connection too!

02:25:29.568 --> 02:25:30.737
FELICIA: So here's the stone.

02:25:30.737 --> 02:25:32.688
SAM: I have had some Aldors in my life, too.

02:25:32.688 --> 02:25:34.268
FELICIA: I want to hear all about them.

02:25:34.268 --> 02:25:37.923
SAM: Yes, mainly they were whores who kicked me
out early.

02:25:37.923 --> 02:25:39.140
FELICIA: Oh.

02:25:39.140 --> 02:25:43.182
SAM: But they-- in a similar way they disrespected
me, didn't see the true Scanlan

02:25:43.182 --> 02:25:44.697
that I could've been.

02:25:44.697 --> 02:25:47.366
FELICIA: I mean, I was-- listen. The one time we
were together it was after I gave him armor, but

02:25:47.366 --> 02:25:48.537
he was not servicing me--

02:25:48.537 --> 02:25:49.742
SAM: Wait, together?

02:25:49.742 --> 02:25:50.518
FELICIA: Yes.

02:25:50.518 --> 02:25:51.363
SAM: You've been with him?

02:25:51.363 --> 02:25:52.320
FELICIA: Of course, I told you--

02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:54.517
MARY: Oh look, we seem to be coming to something
interesting in the road.

02:25:54.517 --> 02:25:55.728
FELICIA: Were you not listening?

02:25:55.728 --> 02:25:57.034
SAM: I thought you meant that as a metaphor.

02:25:57.034 --> 02:26:00.771
FELICIA: No, it was his birthday and I bought him
some very expensive custom armor that he-- you

02:26:00.771 --> 02:26:04.117
said he had it on, which is-- he obviously has
feelings for me to wear that armor.

02:26:04.117 --> 02:26:05.789
It was 10,000 gold--

02:26:05.789 --> 02:26:06.780
LAURA: (gasps)

02:26:06.780 --> 02:26:12.049
FELICIA: -- and he just, he was very attracted to
me that night and we had intercourse so. My uncle

02:26:12.049 --> 02:26:13.162
was very upset with me.

02:26:13.162 --> 02:26:14.567
TRAVIS: Intercourse.

02:26:14.567 --> 02:26:16.572
FELICIA: And after that, he never saw--

02:26:16.572 --> 02:26:23.483
SAM: Somehow you made that less sexual than I
could've ever imagined. Is there-- Grog, what's

02:26:23.543 --> 02:26:28.268
the term for when your penis is inverted? The
opposite of a boner?

02:26:28.268 --> 02:26:29.581
TRAVIS: Belly button.

02:26:29.581 --> 02:26:30.865
SAM: Yeah, that's what I've got now.

02:26:30.865 --> 02:26:36.112
FELICIA: Anyway, I was really certain after that
moment that we would be together forever and I

02:26:36.112 --> 02:26:37.280
never saw him again.

02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:40.767
SAM: You know men are fickle and when I-- I'll
have a talk with him.

02:26:40.767 --> 02:26:43.204
FELICIA: He kept the armor, so he has feelings.
Let's just move on.

02:26:43.204 --> 02:26:44.101
SAM: Let's do it.

02:26:44.101 --> 02:26:44.965
FELICIA: Here's the stone.

02:26:44.965 --> 02:26:45.883
SAM: Let's not dwell.

02:26:45.883 --> 02:26:49.505
MATT: You take the stone and your fatigue fades.
You find yourself adjusting well to the cold

02:26:49.505 --> 02:26:53.744
climate, thanks to your gift from your new leader
and--

02:26:53.744 --> 02:26:55.279
SAM: I love her.

02:26:55.279 --> 02:26:56.628
MARY: Leader-slash-lover?

02:26:56.628 --> 02:27:05.084
MATT: All right, so as you guys pull off the side
of the road and use the cover of the forest to

02:27:05.084 --> 02:27:10.100
help from the snow that's beginning to hit even
harder, you gather there is in this vicinity an

02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:16.778
ever waxing-and-waning blizzard that pours
through. You can see a localized area that is not

02:27:16.778 --> 02:27:21.540
really moving. You wait like a good 20, 30 minutes
to see if there's any movement but the blizzard is

02:27:21.540 --> 02:27:23.673
not shifting from its location.

02:27:23.673 --> 02:27:29.741
FELICIA: Should we try to do the spell, locate
dragon again, just to make sure

02:27:29.741 --> 02:27:31.073
it's at the top of this--

02:27:31.073 --> 02:27:32.412
SAM: Good leading, good leading.

02:27:32.412 --> 02:27:33.983
LAURA: Sure, I will try it again.

02:27:33.983 --> 02:27:45.354
MATT: All right. You sit and concentrate for a
moment and... nothing. Nothing-- wait. You sense

02:27:45.354 --> 02:27:49.268
this very, very small blip at the edge, it's
moving quickly.

02:27:49.268 --> 02:27:51.780
LAURA: There. There's a dragon.

02:27:51.780 --> 02:27:54.071
FELICIA: Where is it, which, which--

02:27:54.071 --> 02:27:55.457
LAURA: It's fast, wait.

02:27:55.457 --> 02:27:57.530
SAM: Which way, east, north, south?

02:27:57.530 --> 02:27:59.981
MATT: It's getting closer, you can sense its
energy up in the air.

02:27:59.981 --> 02:28:01.305
LAURA: It's up in the air.

02:28:01.305 --> 02:28:06.731
MATT: At that point you hear this distant guttural
howl, just a--

02:28:06.731 --> 02:28:08.870
LAURA: We should hide just in case. How about we
hide?

02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:14.718
MATT: (raaah!) comes bursting out over the air.
The wind begins to pick up and the snowfall begins

02:28:14.718 --> 02:28:18.235
to become ice. The rest of you guys have to kind
of duck yourself out of the way--

02:28:18.235 --> 02:28:19.474
LAURA: No way.

02:28:19.474 --> 02:28:22.343
MATT: -- everyone make a reflex, or sorry, a
dexterity saving throw.

02:28:22.343 --> 02:28:23.821
MARY: What's that?

02:28:23.821 --> 02:28:25.474
FELICIA: I am very good at that.

02:28:25.474 --> 02:28:27.994
SAM: I don't even know what this is, what is
this?

02:28:27.994 --> 02:28:30.676
FELICIA: That's a nine.

02:28:30.676 --> 02:28:31.980
MARY:12.

02:28:31.980 --> 02:28:33.070
TRAVIS: Eight.

02:28:33.070 --> 02:28:35.700
SAM: 13.

02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:36.976
FELICIA: 11.

02:28:36.976 --> 02:28:38.174
TALIESIN: 16.

02:28:38.174 --> 02:28:39.404
LAURA: 24.

02:28:39.404 --> 02:28:44.437
MATT: All right. All of you guys manage to find
cover under the nearest tree where the bough of

02:28:44.437 --> 02:28:54.195
the forest is at its strongest. You avoid most of
the brunt impact, Grog unfortunately takes a good

02:28:54.195 --> 02:29:00.355
portion of slamming ice-stone damage. Negligible
for most damage you're used to, but you still take

02:29:00.355 --> 02:29:04.088
four points of bludgeoning damage from the falling
ice.

02:29:04.088 --> 02:29:05.180
TRAVIS: All right.

02:29:05.180 --> 02:29:09.111
MATT: The sleet. As you guys are currently in this
position, you can see barely through the very very

02:29:09.111 --> 02:29:14.543
heavy snowfall a shape that (whoo) moves over in
the distance that circles around and then heads

02:29:14.543 --> 02:29:18.868
back in a western direction.

02:29:18.868 --> 02:29:20.419
SAM: Can we get its attention?

02:29:20.419 --> 02:29:24.505
MARY: I cast Beast Speak and say, where do you
live?! I'm kidding.

02:29:24.552 --> 02:29:26.615
TRAVIS: I was like, really?

02:29:26.615 --> 02:29:29.428
TALIESIN: Thank you for that addendum, because
we--

02:29:29.428 --> 02:29:31.037
LAURA and MARY: Not really.

02:29:31.037 --> 02:29:32.024
MARY: Not really.

02:29:32.024 --> 02:29:33.438
LAURA: All of us are like, ahh.

02:29:33.438 --> 02:29:34.783
MARY: I have a sick sense of humor.

02:29:34.783 --> 02:29:37.670
LAURA: Can I see which direction it's going back
towards the mountain?

02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:43.475
MATT: Yeah. You look over in that direction and
you can barely make it through bits as the storm

02:29:43.475 --> 02:29:48.858
intensifies and begins to subside a little bit,
you can see what looks to be the gentle outline of

02:29:48.858 --> 02:29:53.861
a mountain range maybe about ten miles off from
the road. To the west of the road,

02:29:53.861 --> 02:29:55.503
into the forest itself.

02:29:55.503 --> 02:29:56.771
LAURA: Great.

02:29:56.771 --> 02:29:58.141
SAM: We've got this.

02:29:58.141 --> 02:29:59.214
LAURA: We got to go in the forest.

02:29:59.214 --> 02:30:02.174
FELICIA: Okay. Let's go!

02:30:02.174 --> 02:30:05.285
MARY: It should provide us with some cover from
the snow as well.

02:30:05.335 --> 02:30:07.603
SAM: But who knows what lurks in those woods?

02:30:07.603 --> 02:30:08.617
MARY: This is true.

02:30:08.617 --> 02:30:11.354
LAURA: Well, I can also, you know, see what kind
of creatures are around.

02:30:11.354 --> 02:30:12.499
SAM: All right.

02:30:12.499 --> 02:30:13.578
MARY: Oh, yes.

02:30:13.578 --> 02:30:17.585
LAURA: No, I can't. I can't see animals. Just
kidding.

02:30:17.585 --> 02:30:20.282
FELICIA: Well, we don't really have a choice, we
have to get the dragon.

02:30:20.282 --> 02:30:21.289
SAM: Let's plunge in.

02:30:21.289 --> 02:30:22.392
FELICIA: And we have a time limit.

02:30:22.392 --> 02:30:23.506
TRAVIS: You're the team leader.

02:30:23.506 --> 02:30:25.849
FELICIA: We have-- we need-- now there's really no
other way to go,

02:30:25.849 --> 02:30:26.950
we have to go through the forest?

02:30:26.950 --> 02:30:28.445
MATT: Currently.

02:30:28.445 --> 02:30:29.257
FELICIA: Currently.

02:30:29.257 --> 02:30:34.007
MATT: Unless you guys have any other plan, right
now there is about ten miles of forest between

02:30:34.007 --> 02:30:38.779
you, near the roadway, and this mountain range,
where apparently the dragon has returned to.

02:30:38.779 --> 02:30:42.854
FELICIA: Great, okay. Well, there's nothing else
to be done, we just have to go as fast as we can.

02:30:42.854 --> 02:30:44.059
LAURA: All right.

02:30:44.059 --> 02:30:45.877
MARY: I could cast Invisibility and Fly, I could
fly us all somewhere.

02:30:45.877 --> 02:30:47.433
FELICIA: I don't really have any other--

02:30:47.433 --> 02:30:49.447
LAURA: Oh, you can't fly all of us, can you?

02:30:49.447 --> 02:30:51.282
MARY: I think I can fly up to nine, I thought.

02:30:51.282 --> 02:30:53.390
LAURA: You can fly up to nine people?

02:30:53.390 --> 02:30:54.310
SAM: What?

02:30:54.310 --> 02:30:56.224
LAURA: Tiberius can only fly up to three people.

02:30:56.224 --> 02:30:57.391
SAM: What kind of devil are you?

02:30:57.391 --> 02:30:58.568
FELICIA: Oh, should we fly? We--

02:30:58.568 --> 02:30:59.756
SAM: Wait, can you fly?

02:30:59.756 --> 02:31:02.448
FELICIA: I can't fly, no, but maybe Zahra can
fly.

02:31:02.448 --> 02:31:06.696
LAURA: If we're flying, though, I'm just going to
put this out there. There's nowhere to hide if the

02:31:06.696 --> 02:31:08.079
dragon comes back out.

02:31:08.079 --> 02:31:10.160
MARY: I understand, but I can also cast
Invisibility.

02:31:10.160 --> 02:31:11.455
LAURA: Well, that's awesome.

02:31:11.455 --> 02:31:13.261
FELICIA: But that doesn't last as long, or--

02:31:13.261 --> 02:31:17.625
MARY: I can target one additional creature for
each slot above third, what does that mean?

02:31:17.625 --> 02:31:21.665
MATT: It means, if everything you cast is at
maximum level, it would be fifth level, which

02:31:21.665 --> 02:31:23.496
means you could target three creatures with
Invisibility.

02:31:23.496 --> 02:31:25.821
MARY: Three creatures with Invisibility and three
creatures with Fly.

02:31:25.874 --> 02:31:28.379
LAURA: But is it at the same time or is it a
concentration?

02:31:28.379 --> 02:31:33.609
MATT: It's a concentration either way. I will say,
as soon as you start thinking about flying and

02:31:33.609 --> 02:31:37.353
getting there, you look up past where the trees
are. Flying in this weather

02:31:37.353 --> 02:31:39.956
would be a terrible idea.

02:31:39.956 --> 02:31:41.233
FELICIA: That's a terrible idea.

02:31:41.233 --> 02:31:42.302
MARY: All right.

02:31:42.302 --> 02:31:45.014
FELICIA: You know what I was thinking, it might
not be good. It might not be good. Let's just

02:31:45.014 --> 02:31:48.010
ride, we have the horses, we can't leave the
horses behind. We only have--

02:31:48.010 --> 02:31:49.383
TRAVIS: Right, okay. We start riding.

02:31:49.383 --> 02:31:52.107
SAM: We could, we just rented them. 50 bucks, so.

02:31:52.107 --> 02:31:56.538
FELICIA: Don't remind me of that, that was just a
thing. All right, onward! Let's--

02:31:56.538 --> 02:31:58.691
TRAVIS: I'm still in the back doing the dust of
uhhh.

02:31:58.691 --> 02:31:59.646
FELICIA: Yay, go.

02:31:59.646 --> 02:32:00.810
MATT: Dust of uhhh?

02:32:00.810 --> 02:32:02.101
TRAVIS: Nay-nay.

02:32:02.101 --> 02:32:03.209
MARY: We ride!

02:32:03.209 --> 02:32:10.426
MATT: As the flower girl picks up the back end,
you guys trudge on horseback into the heart of

02:32:10.426 --> 02:32:17.176
this section of the Vesper Timberlands. It is a
very dense forest and you find that any

02:32:17.176 --> 02:32:20.412
straight-road path is not going to function, as
you're constantly having to weave in and out from

02:32:20.412 --> 02:32:25.506
the thick tree trunks and heavy foliage that has
taken over the floor. Plus a layer of snow that

02:32:25.506 --> 02:32:32.206
tends to encapsulate the area, your movement is
relatively restrained than this pace you're

02:32:32.206 --> 02:32:35.983
normally used to going. You have-- what bonuses do
you have because of the forest terrain?

02:32:35.983 --> 02:32:37.273
LAURA: I have--

02:32:37.273 --> 02:32:38.883
MATT: To the group's movement, if any?

02:32:38.883 --> 02:32:42.437
LAURA: Yes, movement is fine for all of the
group.

02:32:42.437 --> 02:32:46.387
MATT: Thankfully, though, you have Vex guiding you
on this path and where it would be a very

02:32:46.387 --> 02:32:51.541
difficult experience pushing through this forest,
especially with the time limit you have, she is

02:32:51.541 --> 02:32:56.014
able to find the quickest paths to dodge any of
the heavy areas that are dense

02:32:56.014 --> 02:32:57.438
with dangerous snowfall.

02:32:57.438 --> 02:33:02.071
LAURA: I would also like to perception ahead and
make sure that nothing is going to

02:33:02.071 --> 02:33:03.517
sneak attack us again.

02:33:03.517 --> 02:33:04.754
MATT: Understood, understood.

02:33:04.754 --> 02:33:06.096
FELICIA: Very good call.

02:33:06.096 --> 02:33:10.498
MATT: All right. In that regard, I would like you
to go ahead and make a perception check.

02:33:10.498 --> 02:33:17.134
SAM: Oh boy. Something out there. Nope.

02:33:17.134 --> 02:33:21.953
LAURA: That is lower than my passive perception,
though. Which is 21.

02:33:21.953 --> 02:33:23.856
SAM: Your passive perception--

02:33:23.856 --> 02:33:25.039
LAURA: -- is 21.

02:33:25.039 --> 02:33:25.982
MATT: Right.

02:33:25.982 --> 02:33:26.934
SAM: Wow.

02:33:26.934 --> 02:33:30.691
LAURA: And plus five-- no, that's it, just 21. But
it's a 12. For right now.

02:33:30.691 --> 02:33:34.137
MATT: It's a 12? Okay. You keep an eye out as you
continue to move forward.

02:33:34.137 --> 02:33:38.780
LAURA: Oh, but I get to roll twice though, because
it's my favored terrain?

02:33:38.780 --> 02:33:41.084
MATT: That's true, you do. Advantage on that.

02:33:41.084 --> 02:33:45.344
LAURA: Okay. Shut up.

02:33:45.344 --> 02:33:47.243
SAM: When the cameraman laughs.

02:33:47.243 --> 02:33:49.590
MARY: When the cameraman is laughing at you, you
know it's a good roll.

02:33:49.590 --> 02:33:52.747
LAURA: It's-- no, that's not that bad-- It's 15.

02:33:52.747 --> 02:33:54.275
MATT: That's an improvement.

02:33:54.275 --> 02:33:55.524
LAURA: It's a slight improvement.

02:33:55.524 --> 02:33:56.720
FELICIA: Better than 12.

02:33:56.720 --> 02:33:57.694
LAURA: That's right.

02:33:57.694 --> 02:33:58.899
MATT: 15 is indeed--

02:33:58.899 --> 02:34:00.564
MATT and TALIESIN: -- better than 12.

02:34:00.564 --> 02:34:02.382
MATT: The things you learn watching Critical Role,
ladies and gentlemen.

02:34:02.533 --> 02:34:04.025
SAM: (sings) The more you know.

02:34:04.025 --> 02:34:05.179
TRAVIS: Learning.

02:34:05.179 --> 02:34:11.573
MATT: So in following Vex through the forest,
weaving back and forth, about an hour of travel in

02:34:11.573 --> 02:34:16.436
you-- I know you gotta get going soon. How soon do
you have to go?

02:34:16.497 --> 02:34:19.842
LAURA: We're calling a car, and it's however soon
it gets here.

02:34:19.842 --> 02:34:29.401
MATT: All right. Pushing forward, you eventually
manage to avoid what looks like a long frozen lake

02:34:29.401 --> 02:34:33.318
in the center of the forest with a series of
heavily iced-over stone ruins.

02:34:33.318 --> 02:34:35.056
LAURA: Don't walk on this lake.

02:34:35.056 --> 02:34:37.081
FELICIA: Oh, good call, good call.

02:34:37.081 --> 02:34:41.282
MATT: You move around and in the distance you
swear you see the glimmer of some glowing entity

02:34:41.282 --> 02:34:46.497
in the midst of these ruins and you manage to keep
enough of a distance. Everyone make a stealth

02:34:46.497 --> 02:34:52.187
check on this. So roll a d20 and add your stealth
bonus.

02:34:52.247 --> 02:34:55.338
FELICIA: Add it, or take away? Because it's
negative.

02:34:55.338 --> 02:34:57.301
MATT: For you it'd be taking away from your
stealth roll.

02:34:57.301 --> 02:34:58.464
FELICIA: Great, that's great.

02:34:58.464 --> 02:34:59.903
SAM: Clang-clang-clang.

02:34:59.903 --> 02:35:00.824
FELICIA: 11.

02:35:00.824 --> 02:35:01.691
MARY: 13.

02:35:01.691 --> 02:35:02.471
MATT: 13.

02:35:02.471 --> 02:35:03.403
SAM: 13.

02:35:03.403 --> 02:35:04.672
LAURA: 16.

02:35:04.672 --> 02:35:06.700
MATT: Grog? Stealth.

02:35:06.700 --> 02:35:08.158
TRAVIS: Stealth is 14.

02:35:08.158 --> 02:35:09.263
SAM: 13.

02:35:09.263 --> 02:35:10.244
TALIESIN: 24.

02:35:10.244 --> 02:35:11.220
FELICIA: 11.

02:35:11.220 --> 02:35:16.924
MATT: All right, so. Though clumsy in form, the
group is able to pull you far enough away where

02:35:16.924 --> 02:35:21.963
they cover your bases on this, and this glowing
entity doesn't seem to take notice of your passage

02:35:21.963 --> 02:35:27.498
as it slowly fades into the stone ruins once
again. You press on towards the mountain--

02:35:27.498 --> 02:35:28.915
SAM: Should we go check that glowing entity out?

02:35:28.915 --> 02:35:29.929
MARY: What was it?

02:35:29.929 --> 02:35:32.579
FELICIA: Do I-- oh, do I know? I have an arcana,
or would it be nature, or?

02:35:32.579 --> 02:35:37.245
MATT: For this, I would say go ahead and make a
religion check, actually.

02:35:37.245 --> 02:35:40.488
FELICIA: Oh, good, three. I don't know, it's 11.

02:35:40.488 --> 02:35:44.855
MATT: It's spooky and you don't like it.

02:35:44.855 --> 02:35:46.661
FELICIA: I don't like that so let's keep going.

02:35:46.661 --> 02:35:47.963
LAURA: We should avoid it.

02:35:47.963 --> 02:35:49.474
SAM: Okay. If you insist.

02:35:49.474 --> 02:35:56.063
MATT: Pushing forward about another hour and a half,
two hours, you eventually make it through the

02:35:56.123 --> 02:36:02.955
forest, dodging a few other areas where clustered
vines and almost thick brambles begin to close off

02:36:02.955 --> 02:36:08.233
portions of the passage. Without Vex's help on
this it would be a very difficult element to

02:36:08.233 --> 02:36:11.840
traverse, but you manage to find areas you can cut
through, and where the weak points of these

02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:18.132
various interwoven nets of vinework are. You push
through until the forest comes to an end at the

02:36:18.132 --> 02:36:25.379
base of a giant tree-covered mountain that is
currently coated in snow and ice. Looking about,

02:36:25.379 --> 02:36:32.307
you can see that the highest spire is obscured by
the very blizzard clouds ahead. There is heavy

02:36:32.380 --> 02:36:39.209
snowfall in this vicinity and your vision is
semi-obscured past a certain area. Only because of

02:36:39.209 --> 02:36:42.118
Vex's keen sight are you able to make out the
details of that mountain

02:36:42.118 --> 02:36:44.348
disappearing into the blizzard.

02:36:44.348 --> 02:36:46.310
TRAVIS: This is very much like home for me.

02:36:46.310 --> 02:36:50.508
LAURA: Do we see any-- anything along the bottom,
the edge of the mountain that looks like it could

02:36:50.508 --> 02:36:52.120
open into a cavern of some sort?

02:36:52.120 --> 02:36:55.115
MATT: There are a number of large rocks and
boulders that seem to have tumbled off the

02:36:55.115 --> 02:36:58.937
mountain and embedded themselves in the ground in
sections. You do see what looks to be a cavern of

02:36:58.937 --> 02:37:05.567
some kind that is in the-- at the base of this
mountain, it's about 20, 25 feet high and about 35

02:37:05.567 --> 02:37:06.813
feet wide.

02:37:06.813 --> 02:37:07.861
MARY: Should we maybe go in?

02:37:07.861 --> 02:37:10.685
FELICIA: Does it look like we can climb the
mountain, or is it just too sheer?

02:37:10.685 --> 02:37:13.663
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

02:37:13.663 --> 02:37:18.839
FELICIA: Oh, good, this is my best. Oh! Nope, it's
a nine.

02:37:18.839 --> 02:37:21.278
(laughter)

02:37:21.278 --> 02:37:24.856
MATT: You-- you've read about mountains.

02:37:24.856 --> 02:37:28.210
(laughter)

02:37:28.210 --> 02:37:33.027
MATT: And you've seen many pictures of them.
Seeing one up close? They're a lot bigger than you

02:37:33.027 --> 02:37:34.305
thought they'd be.

02:37:34.305 --> 02:37:39.463
FELICIA: Very large mountain, guys, I'm not sure--
as a leader I'd like to invite you guys to

02:37:39.463 --> 02:37:43.506
evaluate whether we could possibly climb this
mountain.

02:37:43.506 --> 02:37:46.779
TALIESIN: I would like to evaluate whether or not
we could climb this mountain.

02:37:46.779 --> 02:37:47.990
SAM: You're delegating, that's good.

02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:49.090
LAURA: Yeah, delegate.

02:37:49.090 --> 02:37:50.313
TRAVIS: So I'm proficient here, right?

02:37:50.313 --> 02:37:51.342
LAURA: Can we check?

02:37:51.342 --> 02:37:56.814
MATT: You-- I'd say for this and since you know
mountain ranges pretty well, go ahead and make a

02:37:56.814 --> 02:37:59.048
wisdom check on this, yeah.

02:37:59.048 --> 02:38:00.783
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:38:00.783 --> 02:38:02.314
MATT: Just add your wisdom modifier to the roll.

02:38:02.314 --> 02:38:04.502
TRAVIS: Which is zero. (laughs) 15.

02:38:04.502 --> 02:38:09.613
MATT: 15. As you're kinda taking a moment to
inspect it, you, your people, your actual race

02:38:09.613 --> 02:38:14.918
being mountain-born people, you look at it, and it
could be scaled. It would be a dangerous climb and

02:38:14.918 --> 02:38:17.767
you would need some semblance of simple climbing
tools to do so.

02:38:17.767 --> 02:38:20.959
TRAVIS: So we got to make it come to us.

02:38:20.959 --> 02:38:22.082
FELICIA: Well.

02:38:22.082 --> 02:38:23.364
MARY: We could.

02:38:23.364 --> 02:38:25.137
LAURA: Oh, that's smart, Grog. That's really
smart!

02:38:25.137 --> 02:38:26.637
FELICIA: We have to lure the dragon down.

02:38:26.637 --> 02:38:28.188
SAM: Or one of us could climb it and--

02:38:28.188 --> 02:38:29.102
TRAVIS: Jump off?

02:38:29.102 --> 02:38:32.516
SAM: -- bring it down as bait. I could do that.

02:38:32.516 --> 02:38:34.114
FELICIA: I don't think that sounds like a good
idea. There's a cavern over there, should we

02:38:34.114 --> 02:38:36.710
inspect it? Maybe there's some inner workings to
get to the top.

02:38:36.710 --> 02:38:40.229
TALIESIN: I think this conversation would be
greatly improved by some sort of cover.

02:38:40.229 --> 02:38:42.966
LAURA: We'll get into cover maybe just to be
safe.

02:38:42.966 --> 02:38:44.815
MARY: I agree, I vote on going to investigate the
cavern.

02:38:44.815 --> 02:38:48.092
FELICIA: Let's go to the cavern. Well, it's not a
democracy, but that's okay, I am totally open--

02:38:48.092 --> 02:38:49.320
MARY: And I agree with your--

02:38:49.320 --> 02:38:53.239
MATT: You hear this heavy sound of wind rushing
suddenly.

02:38:53.239 --> 02:38:54.618
FELICIA: Oh god, get in the cavern, get in the
cavern! Get in the cavern!

02:38:54.618 --> 02:38:55.779
TALIESIN: Cavern now!

02:38:55.779 --> 02:39:05.852
MATT: Let's see. Oof. Okay. (laughs) Vex. On
horseback, you look over, and the snow that's

02:39:05.852 --> 02:39:12.434
hitting your face-- you see a dark shape begin to
form in the snow. It gets larger and larger and

02:39:12.434 --> 02:39:15.531
larger, and you realize it's not something that's
swelling or growing, it's something that's coming

02:39:15.531 --> 02:39:19.824
at you very fast and it's very large. You
immediately try and turn your horse around, but

02:39:19.824 --> 02:39:24.615
it's too fast, and it slams into the side of you,
sending you off the horse and tumbling to the

02:39:24.615 --> 02:39:29.080
ground. You feel a heated pain in your side you
haven't felt in a long time from the impact.

02:39:29.080 --> 02:39:30.411
LAURA: Ah! What?

02:39:30.411 --> 02:39:34.099
MATT: You guys watch as a boulder about that big,
of rock and ice--

02:39:34.099 --> 02:39:35.168
SAM: Oh, shit.

02:39:35.168 --> 02:39:36.691
MATT: -- just smacks into the side of you.

02:39:36.691 --> 02:39:37.663
SAM: Oh, shit.

02:39:37.663 --> 02:39:40.160
LAURA: You're kidding me, right? That sucked.

02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:41.733
MARY: Where did it come from?

02:39:41.733 --> 02:39:43.411
SAM: It was just a random meteor.

02:39:43.411 --> 02:39:45.067
MATT: You take 30 points of bludgeoning damage.

02:39:45.067 --> 02:39:46.387
LAURA: You're kidding me!

02:39:46.387 --> 02:39:47.407
FELICIA: What the--

02:39:47.407 --> 02:39:48.372
MARY: Wow!

02:39:48.372 --> 02:39:49.545
MATT: And you're knocked onto the ground.

02:39:49.545 --> 02:39:50.756
FELICIA: Oh my god, Vex! (screams)

02:39:50.756 --> 02:39:53.436
MATT: The rest of you, who are currently on
horseback, see this, and from the direction of the

02:39:53.436 --> 02:39:58.717
forest you see a large, very large humanoid figure
begin to step out of the edge of the forest.

02:39:58.717 --> 02:40:01.023
LAURA: It's a giant? Oh, no.

02:40:01.023 --> 02:40:08.539
MATT: This low voice kind of
bellows out. You can see on it thick, snow-covered

02:40:08.539 --> 02:40:15.018
fur, patchwork hide armor. The skin itself is a
dull bluish-grey in color, white eyes, a giant

02:40:15.018 --> 02:40:19.224
metallic horn, what looks like some sort of
creature's horns that are affixed to the sides of

02:40:19.276 --> 02:40:24.527
its helmet. A giant axe in its hand. This is
indeed-- and you recognize it immediately-- this

02:40:24.527 --> 02:40:32.288
is a frost giant. You see it reach down
and grab another boulder and begin to toss it in its

02:40:32.441 --> 02:40:35.896
hand. As the rest of you see this, you hear
another bellow.

02:40:35.896 --> 02:40:37.298
LAURA: You speak Giant, you speak Giant, right?

02:40:37.298 --> 02:40:38.373
MATT: Does anyone speak Giant here?

02:40:38.373 --> 02:40:39.403
TRAVIS: I do.

02:40:39.403 --> 02:40:42.887
MATT: You hear a voice come echoing from the
cavern behind you, saying, "Intruder!

02:40:42.887 --> 02:40:44.792
"Take him down!"

02:40:44.792 --> 02:40:46.375
LAURA: Oh no, no no!

02:40:46.424 --> 02:40:47.538
SAM: What do we do, guys?

02:40:47.538 --> 02:40:48.694
MARY: Talk to him, for--

02:40:48.694 --> 02:40:50.051
MATT: A second frost giant steps out of the cavern
behind you.

02:40:50.051 --> 02:40:50.796
LAURA: Shit.

02:40:50.796 --> 02:40:52.449
MATT: And that's where we're going to go ahead and
end the session for today.

02:40:52.449 --> 02:40:54.159
(yelling)

02:40:54.159 --> 02:40:55.795
SAM: We're in between two giants and a dragon?

02:40:55.795 --> 02:40:56.708
FELICIA: Without--

02:40:56.708 --> 02:40:58.309
MARY: Hagawaga... hawafenor!

02:40:58.309 --> 02:40:59.484
LAURA: I'm damaged.

02:40:59.484 --> 02:41:00.527
FELICIA: Very damaged.

02:41:00.527 --> 02:41:01.448
MARY: She's damaged.

02:41:01.448 --> 02:41:03.410
MATT: Yes, on the ground. You marked your damage,
because that carries over to next week.

02:41:03.410 --> 02:41:04.499
LAURA: I did.

02:41:04.499 --> 02:41:08.710
MATT: All right, guys, we'll-- because I know you
had to leave soon and that would be a good place

02:41:08.710 --> 02:41:12.347
to stop it for this point and this week, we're
going to continue this session next week.

02:41:12.347 --> 02:41:13.404
TRAVIS: We're screwed!

02:41:13.404 --> 02:41:14.619
MARY: No we're not!

02:41:14.619 --> 02:41:15.554
LAURA: I'm dead!

02:41:15.554 --> 02:41:16.612
MARY: No we're not.

02:41:16.612 --> 02:41:18.296
MATT: Starting a battle with two delightful frost
giants.

02:41:18.296 --> 02:41:19.949
LAURA: I feel like we did such a good job on the
last one.

02:41:19.949 --> 02:41:21.008
TRAVIS: Two giants!

02:41:21.008 --> 02:41:22.317
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

02:41:22.317 --> 02:41:23.514
MARY: All right.

02:41:23.514 --> 02:41:26.001
MATT: So first off, guys. Welcome to Critical
Role, Mary.

02:41:26.001 --> 02:41:27.653
(cheering)

02:41:27.653 --> 02:41:31.283
MARY: Thank you so much. It was such a bloody
delight.

02:41:31.283 --> 02:41:33.001
LAURA: You have to be careful with my dice.

02:41:33.001 --> 02:41:34.047
SAM: Do they break?

02:41:34.047 --> 02:41:35.306
MATT: Very, very well done.

02:41:35.306 --> 02:41:36.412
LAURA: I've got gems in here.

02:41:36.412 --> 02:41:37.478
MARY: I hope we'll survive.

02:41:37.478 --> 02:41:38.491
FELICIA: You never know.

02:41:38.491 --> 02:41:41.169
SAM: Wow, that was amazing. Mary and Felicia are
so good.

02:41:41.169 --> 02:41:42.246
MARY: Thank you.

02:41:42.246 --> 02:41:43.269
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:44.133
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:41:44.133 --> 02:41:45.503
SAM: So talented. You killed people and stuff.

02:41:45.503 --> 02:41:46.379
TRAVIS: Brilliant.

02:41:46.379 --> 02:41:48.198
MARY: I mended a piece of paper.

02:41:48.198 --> 02:41:50.062
LAURA: You did! And you--

02:41:50.062 --> 02:41:51.912
MATT: Blasted the torso out of an orc.

02:41:51.912 --> 02:41:52.930
MARY: And I killed an orc--

02:41:52.930 --> 02:41:56.525
LAURA: And you made a guy like give us things for
super cheap, which is like

02:41:56.525 --> 02:41:57.701
the best thing in the world.

02:41:57.701 --> 02:41:59.200
MARY: I love a good sale, I do.

02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:00.283
LAURA: I do too!

02:42:00.283 --> 02:42:03.115
MARY: I love finding a bargain. We should
definitely go shopping.

02:42:03.115 --> 02:42:07.708
FELICIA: Oh, I'm fine with it. I'm fine with my
trust fund, because my parents are dead, yay.

02:42:07.708 --> 02:42:09.069
MATT: All right, we have our--

02:42:09.069 --> 02:42:12.487
ZAC: We have some donations to go through, so
guys, just like last week because we're getting so

02:42:12.487 --> 02:42:17.030
many donations we just don't have time to read all
the messages, so we'll just read off who the

02:42:17.030 --> 02:42:23.173
donation was from and say thank you, and then I
will send an exported list with all your messages

02:42:23.173 --> 02:42:28.516
in an e-mail form to all of our hosts so they can
see them. But it's just so many,

02:42:28.516 --> 02:42:29.773
which is amazing.

02:42:29.773 --> 02:42:30.635
LAURA: Yay!

02:42:30.635 --> 02:42:31.744
MATT: You guys are ridiculous.

02:42:31.744 --> 02:42:32.790
TRAVIS: Yeah. You guys are rad.

02:42:32.790 --> 02:42:34.757
ZAC: We just don't have all night to go through
them. Oh, can I make a personal request?

02:42:34.757 --> 02:42:35.472
MATT: Sure.

02:42:35.472 --> 02:42:36.701
ZAC: Can you kill Felicia next week?

02:42:36.701 --> 02:42:38.098
MATT: That's not up to me.

02:42:38.098 --> 02:42:39.477
LAURA: That's just not appropriate.

02:42:39.477 --> 02:42:40.665
FELICIA: What's that about?

02:42:40.665 --> 02:42:42.047
TRAVIS: Wow. Wow.

02:42:42.047 --> 02:42:42.963
MATT: That's really unnecess--

02:42:42.963 --> 02:42:44.200
ZAC: In the game, in the game.

02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:45.138
SAM: No no no no no.

02:42:45.138 --> 02:42:46.208
MATT: Oh, in the game!

02:42:46.208 --> 02:42:47.146
ZAC: In the game.

02:42:47.146 --> 02:42:48.116
MATT: Oh, in the game.

02:42:48.116 --> 02:42:48.857
FELICIA: Funny, like--

02:42:48.857 --> 02:42:50.360
MATT: I was like, I got to think this through,
man. She's right there.

02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:51.357
LAURA: I really have to go!

02:42:51.357 --> 02:42:52.255
MATT: I know.

02:42:52.255 --> 02:42:53.254
TRAVIS: Bye Vex!

02:42:53.254 --> 02:42:54.351
MATT: Bye Laura!

02:42:54.351 --> 02:42:55.094
MARY: Love you!

02:42:55.094 --> 02:42:55.976
LAURA: I love you!

02:42:55.976 --> 02:42:56.958
MATT: Everyone going to GenCon--

02:42:56.958 --> 02:42:57.732
LAURA: Yeah!

02:42:57.732 --> 02:42:58.730
MATT: -- go say hi to her.

02:42:58.730 --> 02:42:59.864
MARY: Yeah, go say hi at GenCon, woo!

02:42:59.864 --> 02:43:01.818
ZAC: You know what, if you wanna like Skype in
from GenCon, let me know.

02:43:01.818 --> 02:43:03.420
LAURA: Well--

02:43:03.420 --> 02:43:04.626
ZAC: You got it on your phone, right?

02:43:04.626 --> 02:43:05.625
SAM: To what?

02:43:05.625 --> 02:43:07.192
LAURA: I do-- to what?

02:43:07.192 --> 02:43:08.205
ZAC: Us!

02:43:08.205 --> 02:43:09.041
LAURA: Just for the heck of it?

02:43:09.041 --> 02:43:10.025
ZAC: Just for the hell of it.

02:43:10.025 --> 02:43:11.029
LAURA: But I'll be on a panel!

02:43:11.029 --> 02:43:12.358
ZAC: The whole time?

02:43:12.358 --> 02:43:14.025
LAURA: The entire time, it's a really long panel.

SAM: Whoa, awesome.

02:46:53.218 --> 02:46:56.240
ZAC: While Ryan's getting you guys' gifts ready, I
wanted to do a really quick announcement for

02:46:56.240 --> 02:47:04.740
tomorrow's show. Tomorrow we are having a new show
pilot kind of idea premiere, with Hector doing

02:47:04.740 --> 02:47:07.931
HeroClix with Alison Haislip tomorrow, it's gonna
be a lot of fun.

02:47:07.931 --> 02:47:08.929
FELICIA: It's really fun!

02:47:08.929 --> 02:47:10.235
MATT: Nice. HeroClix is fun.

02:47:10.235 --> 02:47:12.609
ZAC: Yeah. Hector's got Doctor Doom and Gandalf on
lock, and he challenged anyone

02:47:12.609 --> 02:47:14.156
to try to beat him, so.

02:47:14.156 --> 02:47:16.505
MATT: By the way, I would watch that movie in a
second.

02:47:16.505 --> 02:47:17.204
ZAC: Right?

02:47:17.204 --> 02:47:18.113
MATT: I'm just saying.

02:47:18.113 --> 02:47:21.973
ZAC: Doctor Doom and Gandalf together. I'm really
excited. And then after that--

02:47:21.973 --> 02:47:23.156
MARY: Liam!

02:47:23.156 --> 02:47:29.651
ZAC: We have one of our fan favorites, Robot
Teammate, coming in to do musical improv tomorrow

02:47:29.651 --> 02:47:31.965
night as, and then Gather Your Party with everyone
else, so.

02:47:31.965 --> 02:47:33.235
MATT: (hoarsely) Disadvantage.

02:47:33.235 --> 02:47:36.822
ZAC: Tune in tomorrow night, guys. All right, I
think Ryan's got some gifts for you guys.

02:47:36.822 --> 02:47:45.757
MATT: Yes, continue Critmas. Once again, I'm gonna
reiterate it. The outpouring of this fantastic

02:47:45.757 --> 02:47:51.056
community, what you guys do for each other, the
support you guys have in playing together and

02:47:51.056 --> 02:47:57.726
supporting each other is incredible and I-- every
week we're perpetually blown away and feeling

02:47:57.726 --> 02:48:01.166
unworthy for all the gifts you send, and it's
amazing.

02:48:01.166 --> 02:48:02.624
TRAVIS: Get out of my seat!

02:48:02.624 --> 02:48:08.834
MATT: And it is appreciated, you helped decorate
both the set and our living spaces now with all

02:48:08.834 --> 02:48:12.868
these amazing gifts, so we can see and be reminded
of you guys all the time. So thank you again, so

02:48:12.868 --> 02:48:19.606
much, for all your incredible gifts. I love-- I
can't get over Grog's cask of ale that's just.

02:48:19.606 --> 02:48:21.364
FELICIA: That Grog ale is amazing.

02:48:21.364 --> 02:48:24.825
TRAVIS: It is my favorite thing. It's my little
baby.

02:48:24.825 --> 02:48:25.893
MATT: I know.

02:48:25.893 --> 02:48:27.039
TRAVIS: I love it.

02:48:27.039 --> 02:48:27.899
MATT: So sweet.

02:48:27.899 --> 02:48:29.476
LIAM: Is that your woobie?

02:48:29.577 --> 02:48:31.085
TALIESIN: Hey now. That's not nice.

02:48:31.085 --> 02:48:32.561
TRAVIS: Grog's ale, keep away from giants.

02:48:32.561 --> 02:48:37.450
MATT: Hey congratulations chat room, by the way,
for choosing the contract tonight, adult white

02:48:37.450 --> 02:48:40.793
dragon was definitely the tougher of the
selections.

02:48:40.793 --> 02:48:41.956
TRAVIS: They chose that shit?

02:48:41.956 --> 02:48:45.595
FELICIA: Wait, what? They picked the harder one
for us? Thanks, guys.

02:48:45.595 --> 02:48:47.541
TRAVIS: We love you guys. It's not like we want to
live or anything.

02:48:47.541 --> 02:48:49.345
FELICIA: You want Lyra to die, that's what you
want.

02:48:49.345 --> 02:48:51.092
MATT: There were only a few requests.

02:48:51.092 --> 02:48:52.959
FELICIA: Zac.

02:48:52.959 --> 02:48:55.245
ORION: I was thinking the whole time, I was like--
dicks.

02:48:55.245 --> 02:48:59.590
TRAVIS: Dicks. Why can't they pick like, you
know-- I don't know, goblins

02:48:59.590 --> 02:49:02.156
or like really angry dogs?

02:49:02.156 --> 02:49:04.423
MARY: When you see what we do to orcs.

02:49:04.423 --> 02:49:09.097
ORION: I don't know what would be worse, a dragon
or a beholder.

02:49:09.097 --> 02:49:12.234
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm thinking of that. That instant
death-ray.

02:49:12.234 --> 02:49:13.751
FELICIA: Thank you!

02:49:13.751 --> 02:49:19.160
They all are Critical Role dice, which is
pretty amazing.

02:49:19.208 --> 02:49:22.260
MARY: Yes! That's awesome!

02:49:22.260 --> 02:49:27.040
MATT: All right, guys, real fast we'll get to
these gifts here--, we have a few gifts to open for

02:49:27.193 --> 02:49:40.357
the group here, from a Vincent Langolas. Open
this. Oh yeah!

02:49:40.357 --> 02:49:44.903
SAM: Are they in the box of holding, there in the
box? Somewhere.

02:49:44.903 --> 02:49:47.089
MATT: So, guys, for those who don't know, Vincent
has been--

02:49:47.089 --> 02:49:48.014
SAM: Oh my god.

02:49:48.014 --> 02:49:54.335
MATT: --progressively pumping out amazing episodic
fanfiction of Vox Machina, and sending us all of

02:49:54.335 --> 02:49:58.896
it, the stories are really really awesome. If you
are inclined to, I recommend if you haven't

02:49:58.896 --> 02:50:01.436
already put them online, then share them with the
rest of the Critter community,

02:50:01.436 --> 02:50:02.883
they're really awesome.

02:50:02.883 --> 02:50:06.622
FELICIA: There's a place called wattpad.com where
you-- a lot of people do post fanfic.

02:50:06.622 --> 02:50:07.626
MATT: Oh, awesome.

02:50:07.626 --> 02:50:12.710
FELICIA: I actually am on there for my book, it's
promotion, but when I started poking around there

02:50:12.710 --> 02:50:17.744
was lots of fanfic, a lot of Supernatural fans
around there writing fiction. But like, it could

02:50:17.744 --> 02:50:19.536
be a place that people could post.

02:50:19.536 --> 02:50:21.617
LIAM: Have you written any?

02:50:21.617 --> 02:50:26.855
FELICIA: Not yet, but I do want to. I have to
pick, it might be just Nancy Drew fanfic,

02:50:26.855 --> 02:50:28.038
I'm not sure.

02:50:28.038 --> 02:50:32.979
MATT: Well, I have Vax and Vex's copies here, I'll
get these both to you, Liam, to handle there.

02:50:32.979 --> 02:50:34.859
SAM: One Dwarf Too Many.

02:50:34.859 --> 02:50:37.416
MATT: I'll hold on to Pike's, Ashley's currently
absent, but we'll--

02:50:37.416 --> 02:50:38.933
TALIESIN: This is chapter three?

02:50:38.933 --> 02:50:41.439
MATT: Actually, why don't you hand these out, if
you could, thank you so much. This is the next

02:50:41.439 --> 02:50:44.459
chapter in the One Dwarf Too Many saga.

02:50:44.459 --> 02:50:45.891
SAM: One Dwarf Too Many.

02:50:45.891 --> 02:50:47.225
MATT: One Dwarf Too Many.

02:50:47.225 --> 02:50:49.609
SAM: As read by Sir Ian McKellen.

02:50:49.609 --> 02:50:50.984
LIAM: Here's Percival's.

02:50:50.984 --> 02:50:52.143
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:50:52.143 --> 02:50:53.346
MATT: That is awesome.

02:50:53.346 --> 02:51:01.491
TALIESIN: I need to get these bound at some point.
I feel like I don't work hard enough every time

02:51:01.491 --> 02:51:03.066
one of these comes.

02:51:03.066 --> 02:51:12.615
MATT: All right, so from Joe, aka jockguy89 to
Matt Mercer, "Epic dungeon master

02:51:12.615 --> 02:51:14.240
"needs an epic d20."

02:51:14.240 --> 02:51:15.620
MARISHA: Oh snap!

02:51:15.620 --> 02:51:17.381
SAM: It's made of dice.

02:51:17.381 --> 02:51:19.015
TALIESIN: It's gonna be an engagement d20.

02:51:19.015 --> 02:51:23.269
MATT: Oh, oh I get my own flashing d20 now.

02:51:23.269 --> 02:51:24.501
FELICIA: Is it flashing?

02:51:24.501 --> 02:51:25.635
MARISHA: Is that what it is?

02:51:25.635 --> 02:51:27.222
(cheering)

02:51:27.222 --> 02:51:30.581
MATT: I've seen these, I've seen these, I wanted
one. This is one that if it lands on a 20, it

02:51:30.632 --> 02:51:32.578
flashes a bunch of LEDs on the inside.

02:51:32.578 --> 02:51:34.670
TALIESIN: It gives you an alarm when you know he's
gonna kill a party member.

02:51:34.670 --> 02:51:38.834
MATT: It's like this red glow beneath the shield,
I just kinda look up silently. It's going to be

02:51:38.834 --> 02:51:45.742
great. Thank you so much, Joe, that's really
really sweet. I'm going to use that. Here we have

02:51:45.742 --> 02:51:54.786
a letter. All right, Sir Drey, about 21
hours ago, block. "Hello there, Critical Role, my

02:51:54.835 --> 02:51:57.808
"name is Drey, and my friends and I have created
our own Pathfinder D&amp;amp;D group after religiously

02:51:57.808 --> 02:52:02.383
"watching the show every Thursday." Awesome! "We
used Tabletop in which I purchased a battlemap,

02:52:02.383 --> 02:52:05.764
"but we have really old metal figurines, I was
wondering if by chance you could point us in the

02:52:05.764 --> 02:52:08.985
"direction of where to get better figurines? I've
checked Amazon and a few other comic stores and

02:52:08.985 --> 02:52:11.391
"couldn't find any miniatures. It'd be really a big
help if you could point me in the right direction.

02:52:11.391 --> 02:52:14.502
"I know you might not answer back due to busy
schedules, but thank you guys for putting on the

02:52:14.502 --> 02:52:19.394
"show and entertaining us Critters. Sincerely,
Drey." Thank you, Drey. A lot of these minis come

02:52:19.394 --> 02:52:25.974
from-- if you can't find it at comic stores nearby
there's good websites like Miniature, I think it's

02:52:25.974 --> 02:52:31.258
Miniature Market. There is--Troll and Toad is one
of my mainstays, Troll and Toad has a good

02:52:31.258 --> 02:52:34.318
selection of minis you can order. eBay is also a
good source.

02:52:34.318 --> 02:52:35.700
TALIESIN: Hero Forge.

02:52:35.700 --> 02:52:39.296
MATT: Hero Forge, you can customize your own
character minis, which is really great, and have

02:52:39.296 --> 02:52:47.488
them 3D printed out for you. And then, there
is.... You can order on Amazon some of the packs

02:52:47.488 --> 02:52:52.301
of D&amp;amp;D figures. You don't know what's in there,
it's one of those kinda you know surprise figure

02:52:52.301 --> 02:52:56.438
boxes, which is kinda fun in itself. I've bought
way too many of those. But you can find those on

02:52:56.438 --> 02:53:00.200
Amazon, usually. Just look for Dungeons and
Dragons miniature boxes and Pathfinder boxes as

02:53:00.200 --> 02:53:03.388
well, they have a whole slew of that, so. Those
would be your best bets.

02:53:03.388 --> 02:53:05.851
MARISHA: They're like miniature grab bags.

02:53:05.851 --> 02:53:14.005
MATT: Apparently. Oh, what? All right. "Matt, can
read on air." And then I can read that off the air.

02:53:14.005 --> 02:53:21.587
That's the private conversation. Here we go, this
is filled with money! No, it's not. It's my

02:53:21.587 --> 02:53:24.055
favorite fan.

02:53:24.055 --> 02:53:25.811
MARY: It's a check!

02:53:25.811 --> 02:53:31.295
MATT: I want to take a moment to say, I appreciate
that most of our letters we get are hand-written,

02:53:31.346 --> 02:53:37.651
and that is such a rarity these days and it kinda
makes this little archaic happiness in my heart

02:53:37.651 --> 02:53:42.825
sprout. So, "Matt, so far from my experience, DMs
typically have a ton of dice, so I thought why not

02:53:42.825 --> 02:53:48.206
"make a little bug to help with the struggle." Bag!
Bag to help with the struggle. Oh. Read that

02:53:48.206 --> 02:53:51.640
'bug'. I'm also bad at writing hand, reading
handwriting. I love handwritten letters, I'm just

02:53:51.640 --> 02:53:52.853
terrible at them, I apologize.

02:53:52.853 --> 02:53:55.047
MARISHA: I got really excited, I thought it was
gonna be like a dice bug.

02:53:55.047 --> 02:53:58.347
MATT: Right, or just like a whole bunch of roaches
start pouring out, I'm like, this was a great

02:53:58.347 --> 02:54:09.410
idea. (screams) "I made one for everyone but
started to run out of materials and only sent this

02:54:09.410 --> 02:54:17.134
"one out. Hope you enjoy the candy inside." Ooh.
"Let's really hope it doesn't melt. Sorry if it

02:54:17.134 --> 02:54:19.484
"does. Rebecca Christian." Thank you so much,
Rebecca! That's really sweet. What did Rebecca--

02:54:19.484 --> 02:54:24.436
Oh! That is-- that is a chainmail dice bag.

02:54:24.436 --> 02:54:25.908
ALL: Whoa!

02:54:25.908 --> 02:54:28.420
MATT: That says DM on it in gold chains.

02:54:28.420 --> 02:54:31.350
(cheering)

02:54:31.350 --> 02:54:36.369
FELICIA: That's really hard to make, chainmail. It
really takes a long time.

02:54:36.369 --> 02:54:37.415
MARISHA: Takes forever.

02:54:37.415 --> 02:54:38.432
FELICIA: Yeah, takes forever.

02:54:38.432 --> 02:54:42.829
MATT: It's full of coins. Let's share some gold
coins.

02:54:42.829 --> 02:54:44.823
(cheering)

02:54:44.823 --> 02:54:46.029
MATT: Catch?

02:54:46.029 --> 02:54:47.014
FELICIA: No, no!

02:54:47.014 --> 02:54:48.247
TRAVIS: Throw it at her!

02:54:48.247 --> 02:54:49.916
ORION: Actually, just throw them all to Sam.

02:54:49.916 --> 02:54:53.882
MATT: There you go. Sam! There you go.

02:54:53.882 --> 02:54:58.551
ORION: Hey Matthew?

02:54:58.551 --> 02:55:00.074
MATT: Also acts as a bag protector.

02:55:00.074 --> 02:55:01.424
ORION: Nice sack.

02:55:01.424 --> 02:55:09.542
MATT: Thank you. Oh my god, you guys are so sweet,
thank you so much. That's awesome. And then did we

02:55:09.542 --> 02:55:13.700
find out who these are for? Ryan? Ryan?

02:55:13.700 --> 02:55:14.815
RYAN: Yes?

02:55:14.815 --> 02:55:16.164
MATT: Did you find out who these are for?

02:55:16.164 --> 02:55:18.125
RYAN: Those are for you to distribute, they're
from jpcguy.

02:55:18.125 --> 02:55:24.099
MATT: Jpcguy! Awesome, thank you so much! We got
two sets of elven dice to distribute here amongst

02:55:24.099 --> 02:55:25.582
the party. Oh, these are really cool.

02:55:25.582 --> 02:55:27.277
TRAVIS: I got dwarvish dice to distribute, too.

02:55:27.277 --> 02:55:30.579
ORION: I already got a set, jpcguy already gave me
one, so I'm good.

02:55:30.579 --> 02:55:35.284
MATT: Awesome. Thank you so much, that's amazing.

02:55:35.284 --> 02:55:40.270
TRAVIS: These were from Eric, redzanwatt, "Grog,
thank you to all Critical Role for the joy you

02:55:40.270 --> 02:55:43.457
"bring me and showing me the amazing world of D&amp;amp;D.
These dice would fit in nice with the dwarf beard

02:55:43.457 --> 02:55:48.331
"I hope you finally grow. Your fan, Eric." Very
cool, Eric. Thank you, man.

02:55:48.331 --> 02:55:49.932
FELICIA: When are you gonna grow hair, Grog?

02:55:49.932 --> 02:55:57.487
MATT: The dice pool we've slowly gathered over
this time. So, not to worry.

02:55:57.487 --> 02:56:00.811
TRAVIS: Can I show this off real quick?

02:56:00.811 --> 02:56:01.833
MATT: Yeah?

02:56:01.833 --> 02:56:05.723
TRAVIS: So I'm a crazy Dallas Cowboys fan and
somebody sent me an autographed picture of the

02:56:05.723 --> 02:56:09.895
original three, like, Troy Aikman, Michael Irvin
and Emmitt Smith.

02:56:09.895 --> 02:56:11.168
ALL: What?!

02:56:11.168 --> 02:56:13.581
MATT: I don't know who those are but I'm so happy
for you!

02:56:13.581 --> 02:56:18.433
TRAVIS: It's instantly going on my wall next to my
Dallas Cowboys--

02:56:18.433 --> 02:56:24.426
ORION: I don't watch sports, but I know these
names because that's when I used to watch sports,

02:56:24.426 --> 02:56:25.810
and those are cool names.

02:56:25.810 --> 02:56:28.476
TRAVIS: Thank you. Thank you thank you, I don't
know, the Cowboys are my team.

02:56:28.476 --> 02:56:30.401
ORION: That is ace.

02:56:30.401 --> 02:56:39.236
TRAVIS: It just came from Nostalgic, I don't even
know! Who sent it? It gave me this!

02:56:39.236 --> 02:56:42.234
MARY: Nostalgic in Ohio.

02:56:42.234 --> 02:56:44.210
MARISHA: Thanks, nostalgic.

02:56:44.210 --> 02:56:45.503
FELICIA: In Ohio.

02:56:45.503 --> 02:56:49.477
SAM: Wow, for a fan of the Cowboys to get that,
that's amazing!

02:56:49.477 --> 02:56:51.042
FELICIA: How did they know that?

02:56:51.042 --> 02:56:52.243
TRAVIS: Internet?

02:56:52.243 --> 02:57:03.967
SAM: I am a fan of obscure Picasso art. And
sketches. Maybe Hundertwasser sketches, or

02:57:03.967 --> 02:57:04.979
something.

02:57:04.979 --> 02:57:06.366
(laughter)

02:57:06.366 --> 02:57:08.440
LIAM: You're human? You can have these.

02:57:08.440 --> 02:57:10.426
FELICIA: Oh yay! Oh, these are beautiful.

02:57:10.426 --> 02:57:11.508
TALIESIN: These are fabulous.

02:57:11.508 --> 02:57:12.514
MATT: These are awesome dice.

02:57:12.514 --> 02:57:14.072
FELICIA: I had a whole, I used this color dice.

02:57:14.072 --> 02:57:22.282
ORION: I have one more, we have a message, a
letter from our friends over at Gamechanger.

02:57:22.282 --> 02:57:23.980
MARISHA: Oh, Gamechanger!

02:57:23.980 --> 02:57:29.580
ORION: "Dear Critical Role and Geek and Sundry
team, huge thanks to all of you for having us on

02:57:29.580 --> 02:57:37.458
"your show, promoting our charity and supporting
the DX15 campaign." Which is the Deus Ex campaign

02:57:37.458 --> 02:57:43.399
we were doing. "Your support truly made a
difference in the campaign and Taylor and Jim had

02:57:43.399 --> 02:57:49.824
"an awesome time in your studio. So cool!!!" Three
exclamation points. "We would love to work

02:57:49.824 --> 02:57:55.431
"together in the future and hope that someday all
of you or some of you can join us at the hospital

02:57:55.431 --> 02:58:00.503
"and deliver gifts and joy and inspiration to the
young patients and show your gaming-- show how

02:58:00.563 --> 02:58:06.836
"gaming plays such a critical role in their
treatment." I accept that challenge, I will do

02:58:06.836 --> 02:58:15.009
that. "Much love, from Gamechanger, Jake Hearst
and Jim Carroll." Flipside-- Oh, Zac, pay

02:58:15.009 --> 02:58:22.178
attention. "We bought Final Fantasy Type 0 for a
giveaway during the Deus Ex thing, but never got a

02:58:22.178 --> 02:58:27.441
"chance to promote it. So we would like to offer it
to you and the team members could give it away to

02:58:27.441 --> 02:58:32.988
"your audience any way you'd like." Zac. "So no
strings, just a thank-you gesture, token of

02:58:32.988 --> 02:58:35.960
"appreciation, and love to all the Critters out
there."

02:58:35.960 --> 02:58:37.791
TRAVIS: That is amazing. Thank you, guys.

02:58:37.791 --> 02:58:41.289
MARISHA: Thanks, Gamechanger! And we have some fun
stickers.

02:58:41.289 --> 02:58:47.711
MATT: Thank you guys again so much for supporting
Gamechanger and our charities and our show and

02:58:47.711 --> 02:58:52.532
everything you guys do, it's truly-- I've never
been progressively and continuously moved by a

02:58:52.532 --> 02:58:56.548
community like this, and you guys make this so
special, so thank you.

02:58:56.548 --> 02:58:59.596
LIAM: It's a happy little spot on the sea of the
insanity that is the internet.

02:58:59.596 --> 02:59:00.457
MATT: I know.

02:59:00.457 --> 02:59:01.254
MARISHA: It's true.

02:59:01.254 --> 02:59:02.094
MARY: Yeah.

02:59:02.094 --> 02:59:05.624
FELICIA: And thanks to the mods who keep the chat,
I watch every week unless I'm out of town and

02:59:05.624 --> 02:59:09.820
like, the fact that everybody in the chat is
somebody I'd like to say hello to is pretty great.

02:59:09.820 --> 02:59:11.602
So thank you for that, all your work.

02:59:11.602 --> 02:59:16.030
MARY: Thanks for being so supportive for those of
us-- I mean, we had so much support coming in this

02:59:16.030 --> 02:59:19.220
week from all the Critters, so thank you very
much.

02:59:19.220 --> 02:59:22.705
MARISHA: Oh my gosh, you guys, get ready for the
fanart.

02:59:22.705 --> 02:59:27.349
ORION: If Felicia's in that, it's gonna be fun.

02:59:27.349 --> 02:59:30.709
MARISHA: It's coming, it's coming, I'm so
excited.

02:59:30.709 --> 02:59:31.817
MATT: Oh man.

02:59:31.817 --> 02:59:32.995
TRAVIS: With Aldor running away.

02:59:32.995 --> 02:59:33.950
MARY: Aldor.

02:59:33.950 --> 02:59:34.957
FELICIA: No.

02:59:34.957 --> 02:59:36.109
MARY: Noooo!

02:59:36.109 --> 02:59:39.045
MATT: I have to say, like, for your first time
playing Dungeons and Dragons, can I just say Mary

02:59:39.045 --> 02:59:40.195
picked that up quick.

02:59:40.195 --> 02:59:41.598
(cheering)

02:59:41.598 --> 02:59:44.881
MARY: Thank you! I had some amazing help and
support from you guys.

02:59:44.881 --> 02:59:48.717
MARISHA: Your like Jedi mind trick there at the
beginning, I was like, oh!

02:59:48.717 --> 02:59:57.000
LIAM: Could somebody draw a picture of Scanlan and
Lyra talking about the birds and the bees? That's

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.670
a request I have. Please.

02:59:59.670 --> 03:00:01.760
MARY: The rest of us sorting through Percy's
guns.

03:00:01.760 --> 03:00:05.863
TRAVIS: Click, no. Click, no. Click, no.

03:00:05.863 --> 03:00:15.055
MATT: Tiberius back, sitting in the background
with Bad News. He's not even in the group, but he

03:00:15.055 --> 03:00:22.943
still can't take it. Thank you guys so much,
again, and I'm excited. I had Greg Tito from

03:00:22.943 --> 03:00:26.849
Wizards of the Coast, Dungeons and Dragons, send a
care package, which we'll distribute once we've

03:00:26.849 --> 03:00:31.748
got the whole group together again. With a bunch
of fun little gifts for the Critters that we want

03:00:31.748 --> 03:00:36.904
to give away in the future, some gifts for you
guys in the group, and a bunch of really really

03:00:36.904 --> 03:00:39.945
cool minis that I get to try and kill you guys
with in the future, so

03:00:39.945 --> 03:00:42.355
thank you very much, Greg Tito.

03:00:42.355 --> 03:00:43.339
MARISHA: Thanks, Greg!

03:00:43.339 --> 03:00:47.935
MATT: And everyone at D&amp;amp;D for sending us that care
package, you have officially helped facilitate a

03:00:47.935 --> 03:00:50.676
TPK at some point in the near future.

03:00:50.676 --> 03:00:53.235
LIAM: We're a big fan of what you do.

03:00:53.235 --> 03:00:55.550
MARISHA: Yes, we love you, Wizards of the Coast.

03:00:55.550 --> 03:00:58.998
MATT: Obviously. My little DM bag. I love it.

03:00:58.998 --> 03:01:04.547
TRAVIS: Joe, a.k.a. jpcguy89, thank you for the
dice as well. I found his thing.

03:01:04.547 --> 03:01:06.246
MATT: Thank you so much, buddy.

03:01:06.246 --> 03:01:07.548
ZAC: Oh, it's his birthday!

03:01:07.548 --> 03:01:09.475

03:01:12.219 --> 03:01:13.358
MARY: Happy birthday to you!

03:01:13.358 --> 03:01:14.504
ZAC: I was just talking to jpcguy.

03:01:14.504 --> 03:01:15.442
(cheering)

03:01:15.442 --> 03:01:16.329
TRAVIS: Happy birthday!

03:01:16.329 --> 03:01:17.536
FELICIA: Yeah, happy birthday.

03:01:17.536 --> 03:01:20.608
LIAM: Zum Geburtstag, ja.

03:01:20.608 --> 03:01:21.561
TRAVIS: What?

03:01:21.561 --> 03:01:24.095
LIAM: That's German for happy birthday, darling.

03:01:24.095 --> 03:01:26.250
TRAVIS: Oh. Fancy secret agent.

03:01:26.250 --> 03:01:34.680
MATT: Shut up, Nightcrawler. Well guys, thank you
so much again, I think we're pretty much good for

03:01:34.680 --> 03:01:36.980
the evening, so we'll see you guys next week
Thursday.

03:01:36.980 --> 03:01:38.716
TRAVIS: Two giants and a dragon, really?

03:01:38.716 --> 03:01:40.082
MATT: Yeah, you guys are fucked.

03:01:40.082 --> 03:01:41.917
ORION: Tune in for these ladies too, please.

03:01:41.917 --> 03:01:43.153
TRAVIS: They'll be back next week.

03:01:43.153 --> 03:01:44.888
FELICIA: Next week I'll be back, hi.

03:01:44.888 --> 03:01:46.043
ZAC: Felicia might die!

03:01:46.043 --> 03:01:47.345
FELICIA: I might die.

03:01:47.345 --> 03:01:51.212
MARISHA: And then after that it's Wil Wheaton and
Will Friedle, so.

03:01:51.212 --> 03:01:52.397
MARY: Tiefling!

03:01:52.397 --> 03:01:53.666
MARISHA: They'll be here as well.

03:01:53.666 --> 03:01:55.603
MARY: My tail is whipping in happiness.

03:01:55.603 --> 03:01:57.550
MATT: Good night guys, good night.

03:01:57.550 --> 03:01:59.323
ALL: Bye!
