BRAIN: Are we on the internet? Denise?

00:00:05.694 --> 00:00:08.529
ASHLEY: Denise isn't here, babe, we're on
vacation.

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:13.071
BRAIN: Psh, we're not on the internet. We're on
vacation! Sorry guys, no official Talks Machina

00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:19.730
tonight. Instead, you'll be joined by the cast of
Critical Role for a very special Critmas episode.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:32.748
We'll be back next week, but until then, stay turnt
my friends.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:52.526
[upbeat music]

00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:58.963
LAURA: I don't know what to do.

00:00:58.963 --> 00:00:59.989
MARISHA: We don't have a host.

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.307
TALIESIN: We've really never had to deal with this
before.

00:01:01.307 --> 00:01:03.806
LAURA: No, this is new.

00:01:03.806 --> 00:01:05.074
DENISE: Hello!

00:01:05.074 --> 00:01:07.002
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Denise?

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:09.403
DENISE: Say hello to everybody first!

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:11.879
LAURA: Hi guys, welcome to Talk Machina!

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:13.882
MARISHA: We need an adult.

00:01:13.882 --> 00:01:15.136
TALIESIN: We have no adults here.

00:01:15.136 --> 00:01:17.235
LAURA: We're gonna have a Critmas.

00:01:17.235 --> 00:01:24.493
TALIESIN: Welcome to Critmas in May. We decided
that we would make a mess of the studio instead of

00:01:24.493 --> 00:01:26.206
Matt and Marisha's house for once.

00:01:26.206 --> 00:01:32.257
MARISHA: There's still a pile of cardboard from
our past Critmas. Need to handle that. Had to

00:01:32.257 --> 00:01:33.798
handle our yard first.

00:01:33.798 --> 00:01:35.816
LAURA: How's that going?

00:01:35.816 --> 00:01:41.877
MARISHA: We fill up the trash bin or the yard bin
once a week. We think it's gonna be about a

00:01:41.877 --> 00:01:45.738
six-week endeavor to keep filling the trash bin
with yard clippings.

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:49.719
TALIESIN: Yay 100th episode! It'll be great!

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.465
MARISHA: My yard will still maybe look like we're
cooking meth.

00:01:53.465 --> 00:01:55.348
LAURA: By then all the weeds will have grown
back!

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:57.666
TALIESIN: They're already trying to turn again
aren't they?

00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:01.705
MARISHA: Well actually now it's kinda happened
because the piles of leaves, the grass underneath

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:06.026
is just dying. It's going the extreme opposite
now.

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:07.605
LAURA: Good times.

00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:14.469
TALIESIN: So we've been sent a lot of stuff over
the last couple months and we're aware we don't

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:18.542
actually have time to open everything but we're
going to do our best to at least-- The crew has

00:02:18.542 --> 00:02:23.868
been generous enough to figure out some
interesting stuff and put it all together in an

00:02:23.868 --> 00:02:25.913
order of interest.

00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:30.093
LAURA: Liam and Matt are on the way by the way!
It's not just gonna be us three alone.

00:02:30.093 --> 00:02:32.749
TALIESIN: Travis and Sam are on their way but
they'll be here by Thursday.

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:36.258
LAURA: Hey! There's somebody!

00:02:36.258 --> 00:02:39.327
TALIESIN: Speak of the devil!

00:02:39.327 --> 00:02:45.307
MARISHA: You made it sooner than you thought! Why
are you holding a bunch of stuff?

00:02:45.307 --> 00:02:48.318
MATT: These are Critmas gifts from Joe Manganiello
for you guys.

00:02:48.318 --> 00:02:54.319
TALIESIN: No! We were just talking about that! Oh
my-- what!

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.558
MATT: This is new dice for you to burn through.

00:02:57.558 --> 00:03:03.800
LAURA: Really? Did he give me that glittery gold
one I saw online, because I wanted it so bad!

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:12.747
MATT: These are for you, Liam, Travis, and Ashley
because you guys need to take notes so Marisha

00:03:12.747 --> 00:03:13.869
isn't the only one.

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:15.166
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's fair.

00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:18.690
MATT: And then you and Sam got afterthoughts.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.537
TALIESIN: That's excellent, my favorite.

00:03:20.537 --> 00:03:22.374
LAURA: Look at these beautiful!

00:03:22.374 --> 00:03:26.309
MARISHA: Oh those are cool!

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:31.070
LAURA: Now they're Yin and Yang, it's like me and
Vax!

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:41.488
MARISHA: They are and they're kind of slightly
see-through. Thanks Joe! Starting Critmas right!

00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:45.939
LAURA: They're warm. Where have they been?

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:47.301
MATT: My car.

00:03:47.301 --> 00:03:51.155
TALIESIN: I'm really hoping that's a
euphemism. There we are.

00:03:51.155 --> 00:03:53.023
LAURA: My car!

00:03:53.023 --> 00:03:55.065
TALIESIN: Ampersand!

00:03:55.065 --> 00:04:01.037
LAURA: By the way, I didn't realize when I made the white dragon
armor that me and Vax are now white and black,

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.738
which is so &lt;i&gt;fucking&lt;/i&gt; cool!

00:04:03.738 --> 00:04:13.168
MARISHA: You're like the Rihanna S&amp;amp;M music video!
Or when her and Britney did it together, she was in

00:04:13.168 --> 00:04:14.528
white and she was in black?

00:04:14.528 --> 00:04:18.899
LAURA: I was thinking like Oreo cookies. Or Yin
and Yang.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:26.617
MARISHA: Nope, I went straight to Rihanna and
Britney Spears. Okay, let's open things!

00:04:26.617 --> 00:04:30.326
MATT: Hey everyone! I'm taking my shoes off
because I want to stink up the place.

00:04:30.326 --> 00:04:32.717
LAURA: I don't have socks on, so I feel weird
about taking these off.

00:04:32.717 --> 00:04:35.617
MATT: I was going to say it's weird that you don't have
socks on.

00:04:35.667 --> 00:04:38.889
LAURA: I know! Maybe I should have worn socks or
my Birkenstocks would have been better.

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.117
MATT: You're fine!

00:04:40.117 --> 00:04:46.098
LAURA: You have some coffee! For me?

00:04:46.098 --> 00:04:47.637
MARISHA: It's for everybody.

00:04:47.637 --> 00:04:49.268
LAURA: Yeah, either of those two mugs are yours.

00:04:49.268 --> 00:04:50.804
MATT: Thank you!

00:04:50.804 --> 00:04:56.708
MARISHA: Matt, this one's apparently for your eyes
only, and it's heavy.

00:04:56.708 --> 00:04:58.308
MATT: My eyes only.

00:04:58.308 --> 00:05:06.218
LAURA: Look at this cutie, can I open it? Or is
this for all of us to-- Should I just start going?

00:05:06.218 --> 00:05:16.618
Number one, this envelope has the most adorable
stickers on it. Including a llama, like Henry,

00:05:16.618 --> 00:05:19.669
that is a painting in me and Travis's house.

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:26.979
MARISHA: Henry, I love Henry.

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.728
LAURA: What? What are you laughing at?

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:38.149
MATT: Jamie Herald Savage sent some cool custom
elements that I can't show you guys in case they

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:46.095
show up in the campaign at some point down the road.
It has here stats for and some cool elements of

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:51.427
creatures. So thank you very much. This is going
to go into future use.

00:05:51.427 --> 00:05:55.740
MARISHA: What happened?

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.129
MATT: What did you get, Taliesin?

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:03.618
TALIESIN: Terry Kobel, I hope I am pronouncing
that right, got me a beautiful copy of "English

00:06:03.618 --> 00:06:06.646
"Pistols and Revolvers," leatherbound!

00:06:06.646 --> 00:06:14.142
MATT: That is Taliesin porn. That is a direct
hit.

00:06:14.142 --> 00:06:18.659
TALIESIN: I want to look at the foiled edges. I'm
so pleased.

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:19.638
MARISHA: Can I take this off?

00:06:19.638 --> 00:06:23.778
TALIESIN: Yeah. This is beautiful.

00:06:23.778 --> 00:06:26.263
LAURA: I know, right!

00:06:26.263 --> 00:06:30.081
MATT: Show us some pages. Open it up, and show us
some pages on the inside.

00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:32.749
TALIESIN: Yeah. It's just gorgeous.

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:35.197
MARISHA: Wait. Go back to the other page.

00:06:35.197 --> 00:06:39.329
LAURA: There it is! How did you find that again
upside-down?

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:42.640
TALIESIN: I don't know how. It's just magic.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.489
MARISHA: Is that a flintlock design?

00:06:44.489 --> 00:06:53.189
TALIESIN: That is a four scythes detonating lock.
That is actually a beautiful piece of lock. I'm

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:56.180
going to be reading this. I am very excited.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.587
LAURA: This is cool!

00:06:57.587 --> 00:06:59.259
TALIESIN: This is beautiful.

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:01.989
MARISHA: They're all dice bags, you guys.

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:11.920
LAURA: But they look like dragon scale dice bags.
Says she made these right after Vax had died. This

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:19.031
is right before-- spoilers-- the resurrection of
Vax. She didn't know if he was going to be alive

00:07:19.031 --> 00:07:25.051
when she made these. We're supposed to guess whose
is whose. I'm guessing that's yours since it's got

00:07:25.051 --> 00:07:28.260
the-- and that one is mine.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.134
TALIESIN: It's got the bird skull and evil.

00:07:30.134 --> 00:07:41.071
LAURA: And this one is Scanlan's. It's Matt's. I
don't know. She double layered them. This is

00:07:41.071 --> 00:07:44.106
Travis because it's got bones and it's Groggy.

00:07:44.106 --> 00:07:49.974
MARISHA: This is Pike, I'm going to say. Yeah,
definitely for Pike.

00:07:49.974 --> 00:07:54.414
LAURA: This is Scanlan. This has got to be Scanlan
with the--

00:07:54.414 --> 00:07:56.119
MARISHA: Yes! And this is Vax.

00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:58.618
LAURA: And this is Keyleth! Yay!

00:07:58.618 --> 00:08:00.271
MARISHA: With the antlers!

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:04.959
LAURA: This is adorable. This is from Karen. Thank
you, Karen. And bidet!

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:08.788
MATT: Thank you for my fist warmer.

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:17.851
LAURA: There's something in here. (shouting) Oh my
God!

00:08:17.851 --> 00:08:20.981
MATT: What did you get?

00:08:20.981 --> 00:08:25.661
LAURA: She crocheted me little Trinket ears!

00:08:25.661 --> 00:08:31.192
MATT: That's adorable. Oh my god.

00:08:31.192 --> 00:08:32.771
LAURA: That's so freaking cute.

00:08:32.771 --> 00:08:45.553
TALIESIN: That's Terry from Illinois.

00:08:45.553 --> 00:08:53.182
LAURA: Where do I put this stuff? I've got so
much, I don't know what to do with it. That's

00:08:53.182 --> 00:08:54.731
yours. That's Liam's.

00:08:54.731 --> 00:09:04.681
MARISHA: This one I actually opened first. This
person whose name is Joshua Owen Lusack or

00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:17.225
Valkyrian Fate. Josh sent me an awesome knife,
that it was the first thing I opened when we pre--

00:09:17.225 --> 00:09:19.672
ALL: Hey!

00:09:19.672 --> 00:09:25.261
LAURA: Directing mode Liam!

00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:26.982
LIAM: I am a professional.

00:09:26.982 --> 00:09:29.332
MARISHA: You look like a professor in a JRPG.

00:09:29.332 --> 00:09:33.482
TALIESIN: You never look this nice when we're
working.

00:09:33.482 --> 00:09:35.242
MATT: You are ultimate sempai, right now.

00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:39.673
MARISHA: Here, do you want a crochet dice bag?

00:09:39.673 --> 00:09:41.371
LAURA: Did you bring your own coffee?

00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:42.791
LIAM: Coffee? Yes.

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:48.641
LAURA: I poured you some coffee, but that's okay.
Me and you can share the other cup of coffee.

00:09:48.641 --> 00:09:52.093
MATT: All you need right now to is fill in your
glasses with some white color so we can't see your

00:09:52.093 --> 00:09:53.303
pupils.

00:09:53.303 --> 00:09:54.512
LAURA: Oh my God.

00:09:54.512 --> 00:10:00.541
MARISHA: Joshua also sent me a bunch of Sixlets.

00:10:00.541 --> 00:10:05.080
TALIESIN: Oh my god! Those are very exciting. I
have some plans for those.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.263
LAURA: (gasps) These are Sixlets?

00:10:06.263 --> 00:10:10.753
MATT: Whoa! They made pearlescent Sixlets?

00:10:10.753 --> 00:10:13.362
MARISHA: And here's a bag that I'm going to open
right now.

00:10:13.362 --> 00:10:15.382
LAURA: These look like BB pellets.

00:10:15.382 --> 00:10:19.162
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I feel like I want to be
witnessed. That's really exciting.

00:10:19.162 --> 00:10:21.413
LIAM: Who sent these, who sent these?

00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:23.983
MATT: Kieran. Kieran sent those.

00:10:23.983 --> 00:10:29.942
LIAM: "For the stealthiest and gloomiest boy
ever." It's like they know me. Yeah.

00:10:29.942 --> 00:10:32.084
LAURA: @kirkwallman on Twitter.

00:10:32.084 --> 00:10:41.183
TALIESIN: I love my tag, too. I'm not even going
to read it. It's so much wonderful shade. That's

00:10:41.183 --> 00:10:42.855
so much shade. I love it.

00:10:42.855 --> 00:10:45.774
LAURA: What do we open next?

00:10:45.774 --> 00:10:51.023
MARISHA: Um, any one. Pick one, Liam.

00:10:51.023 --> 00:10:52.454
LIAM: How's everybody's day?

00:10:52.454 --> 00:10:54.394
LAURA: Pretty good, pretty good.

00:10:54.394 --> 00:11:04.749
MARISHA: Here's someone who sent us all a bunch of
sniper laser pointers that I dropped.

00:11:04.749 --> 00:11:09.945
MATT: Oh, that's awesome! Thank you for that.

00:11:09.945 --> 00:11:12.135
LAURA: This is for Percy.

00:11:12.135 --> 00:11:13.674
LIAM: What are they?

00:11:13.674 --> 00:11:16.844
MARISHA: This one's for the twins. They're laser
scopes.

00:11:16.844 --> 00:11:22.073
LIAM: I'll open it.

00:11:22.073 --> 00:11:27.675
MATT: You guys lose the ones I got you, it doesn't
matter, but if you lose the ones a Critter got

00:11:27.675 --> 00:11:29.413
you... So hold on to that.

00:11:29.413 --> 00:11:33.525
MARISHA: It's not our fault the Twitch stage is
insanity.

00:11:33.525 --> 00:11:35.497
MATT: I know, this is true.

00:11:35.497 --> 00:11:38.444
MARISHA: I don't know where things end up once
they land on that stage.

00:11:38.444 --> 00:11:42.143
LAURA: We finally have a storage place to put our
stuff in between shows, guys.

00:11:42.143 --> 00:11:44.053
MARISHA: That's what they look like.

00:11:44.053 --> 00:11:50.310
TALIESIN: Oh my god, what? This is a little
intense. Oh! The batteries now make sense.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:55.065
MARISHA: Oh, it's such a big box for batteries.

00:11:55.065 --> 00:11:59.185
TALIESIN: There was a weird battery box that we
were shown, and they were like, "Do you know why

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:00.245
"you ordered batteries?"

00:12:00.245 --> 00:12:04.351
LIAM: Can we blind each other with these?

00:12:04.351 --> 00:12:09.005
TALIESIN: Yes. More importantly, we can blind Matt.

00:12:09.005 --> 00:12:10.524
LIAM: Leon Kennedy.

00:12:10.524 --> 00:12:16.245
TALIESIN: I want to know which direction-- I'm so
sorry that I'm about to do this. I don't know how

00:12:16.245 --> 00:12:17.574
to help it.

00:12:17.574 --> 00:12:18.875
MARISHA: Anyone want some Sixlets?

00:12:18.875 --> 00:12:20.152
LAURA: I just want one.

00:12:20.152 --> 00:12:25.906
MARISHA: It's like the Macy's Day Parade.

00:12:25.906 --> 00:12:28.772
LAURA: This feels like it could be really bad,
just to throw Sixlets at the camera.

00:12:28.772 --> 00:12:30.455
MARISHA: Oh, good catch, Courtney.

00:12:30.455 --> 00:12:42.315
MATT: Anybody else want Sixlets off-camera? Got
it, nice! Anybody else over there? So close!

00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:46.492
Sorry, we're having a Sixlets battle, apparently,
off to the side, there.

00:12:46.492 --> 00:12:52.036
LAURA: This looks so real. It's so warm over here,
next to the fire.

00:12:52.036 --> 00:12:57.107
TALIESIN: Oh wow. That's a lot of laser.

00:12:57.107 --> 00:13:02.706
MATT: I would recommend you not ever shine those
in my eyes, please.

00:13:02.706 --> 00:13:08.155
TALIESIN: They also come with a triggering
mechanism. This is really nice.

00:13:08.155 --> 00:13:11.743
MARISHA: You've never had Sixlets?

00:13:11.743 --> 00:13:13.271
MATT: They're amazing.

00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:14.518
LIAM: Trigger to what?

00:13:14.518 --> 00:13:19.956
TALIESIN: You'll love this, this is great. This is
nothing but a good idea. This'll go so well.

00:13:19.956 --> 00:13:21.410
MATT: Marisha, you're opening right now?

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.279
MARISHA: Sure.

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:28.443
LAURA: Is this another box? Is this what you just
pulled out?

00:13:28.443 --> 00:13:30.901
MARISHA: Yes. Yes, it is.

00:13:30.901 --> 00:13:33.653
LAURA: How do I do it?

00:13:33.653 --> 00:13:36.717
TALIESIN: See the end of that coil? That's a
squeezy trigger.

00:13:36.717 --> 00:13:38.723
LAURA: What? Whoa!

00:13:38.723 --> 00:13:40.477
MARISHA: This is from--

00:13:40.477 --> 00:13:43.292
LAURA: I don't want to shine it towards you guys.

00:13:43.292 --> 00:13:48.523
MARISHA: This is from TrappedFox, and it says,
"Dear Liam."

00:13:48.523 --> 00:13:53.085
LIAM: Let's see. Open the box.

00:13:53.085 --> 00:13:56.746
TALIESIN: I'm in no way going to abuse this. Not
going to abuse this at all.

00:13:56.746 --> 00:14:07.469
LIAM: Oh my gosh, that's perfect. Well, I'm going
to read this. You know, I'm always gun-shy about

00:14:07.469 --> 00:14:11.691
reading things right away, because then there's a
little hidden note that says, "By the way, PS,

00:14:11.691 --> 00:14:22.691
"don't read this on the air." Oh man, I launched
out of work like a cannon and I still got here late.

00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:29.702
TALIESIN: In the meantime, there wasn't a card
yet, but I think it came out of this box. Someone

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:35.190
sent me this steampunk tarot set, which I have
admired from afar for quite a while, but I'm going

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.544
to-- I'm very excited.

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:40.850
MARISHA: That's fucking awesome!

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:49.915
MATT: There is no color in nature that should be
this vibrant. Kind of hard to see on the fire, but

00:14:49.915 --> 00:14:59.971
if I-- that is a little, that's a nuclear blue.
And now it is inside of me.

00:14:59.971 --> 00:15:02.610
TALIESIN: Okay. That got weird.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:15.247
MATT: So. (singing) There is a thing here. Whoa,
what is this? What the heck?

00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:27.251
LAURA: These are from Diana, a.k.a. @DruidKeyleth
on Twitter. "Thank you so much for what you do in

00:15:27.251 --> 00:15:31.131
"the game, and for your various voice acting gigs.
I appreciate all of it, and I really hope you

00:15:31.131 --> 00:15:36.759
"enjoy." The fanmixes! She made us mixes!

00:15:36.806 --> 00:15:39.290
MARISHA: They're mixtapes.

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:43.342
MATT: That is awesome! Yay, I got a mixtape!

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:45.530
MARISHA: This is for Ashley, this one's mine.

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:57.791
LAURA: There's a copy for-- Mary gets one for
Zahra, there'll be another batch for Kashaw. Oh

00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:02.311
man, that's so cool.

00:16:02.311 --> 00:16:06.920
TALIESIN: I think you have maybe a series of NPC
ones.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:16.199
LIAM: This is going on my desk at home. This is a
giant d20 that Chad has named the Kraken, and it's

00:16:16.199 --> 00:16:18.771
made from the wood of a pistachio tree.

00:16:18.771 --> 00:16:23.730
(laughter)

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.212
MATT: That's amazing!

00:16:25.212 --> 00:16:29.800
LIAM: This is going to sit on my desk. Thank you,
Chad. This is a very special gift. Thank you.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.259
MATT: That's brilliant. That's actually genuinely
really brilliant.

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:40.020
LIAM: Thank you, I'm really touched. Thank you for
that. Wow. This is not a die, this is a murder

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.250
weapon.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.480
MARISHA: Is it heavy?

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.729
LIAM: Yeah, here.

00:16:43.729 --> 00:16:45.354
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

00:16:45.354 --> 00:16:49.981
LIAM: Anyone who rolls up in my office is gonna
get bludgeoning damage.

00:16:49.981 --> 00:16:55.511
LAURA: Wow, it's so beautiful. Do you want to roll
it?

00:16:55.511 --> 00:17:05.261
LIAM: On a soft service, carpet. But what if I get
a one? That would be bad. Well, I'll just lie.

00:17:05.261 --> 00:17:13.989
Here, I'll hide it. Don't tell the truth. You've
got the word "lie" right in your name. It's a 20!

00:17:13.989 --> 00:17:22.391
It was a three. It still means a lot to me, that's
going to go right on my office desk.

00:17:22.391 --> 00:17:34.843
LAURA: This is so pretty, though. These fanmixes
are so awesome. Mine's called "Winddancer". That's

00:17:34.843 --> 00:17:36.151
really pretty.

00:17:36.151 --> 00:17:37.950
MARISHA: I have to open mine, hang on.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.592
TALIESIN: You know, I don't even want to look.

00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:45.991
LAURA: I'll listen to this on my drive over before
the game, so I can get in my Vex mood.

00:17:45.991 --> 00:17:52.032
LIAM: It's just two hours of Gregorian chant.

00:17:52.032 --> 00:17:53.946
TALIESIN: One bullet is all I need.

00:17:53.946 --> 00:18:02.058
LAURA: We need a box to put this stuff in. I don't
know what to do with the trash.

00:18:02.058 --> 00:18:07.002
MARISHA: Trash box? I tend to just throw it into
the ether.

00:18:07.002 --> 00:18:10.793
LIAM: Did we get the name of the fan?

00:18:10.793 --> 00:18:18.192
LAURA: My arm movement wasn't on screen of that,
like, pathetic.

00:18:18.192 --> 00:18:21.318
LIAM: Sis! Who made these?

00:18:21.318 --> 00:18:26.242
LAURA: These were from Diana, a.k.a.
@DruidKeyleth.

00:18:26.242 --> 00:18:29.373
MARISHA: Mine's called "Cloudburst".

00:18:29.373 --> 00:18:40.134
LAURA: She made a Briarwood mix. That's so
exciting.

00:18:40.134 --> 00:18:46.633
MATT: (laughs)

00:18:46.633 --> 00:18:48.662
LAURA: What is it? What did you get?

00:18:48.662 --> 00:18:50.372
MATT: I'll show you as soon as I get it all out.

00:18:50.372 --> 00:18:54.092
MARISHA: What do you have over there?

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:56.547
MATT: I'll show you once I get it all out, be
patient!

00:18:56.547 --> 00:19:01.581
LAURA: Did anybody send me some candy or some
brownies or maybe a donut?

00:19:01.581 --> 00:19:04.969
MARISHA: Wait, there was another candy box over
there, hang on.

00:19:04.969 --> 00:19:07.942
OFF-SCREEN: Go for one of the Australian boxes.

00:19:07.942 --> 00:19:16.090
MARISHA: One of the Australian boxes, hang on. See
what's going on in there, because that's got

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:17.292
Whoppers on top.

00:19:17.292 --> 00:19:19.214
LAURA: Wow, somebody did send candy!

00:19:19.214 --> 00:19:25.664
TALIESIN: Yeah, we got a peek at Whoppers. I was
gonna say, we don't know what goes any further

00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:26.923
than that.

00:19:26.923 --> 00:19:30.202
LAURA: There's Whoppers and Skittles.

00:19:30.202 --> 00:19:33.043
MARISHA: Ooh, sweet and sour Skittles.

00:19:33.043 --> 00:19:41.102
LAURA: Oh, these are all for you, Marisha. Oh my
gosh. Wait, wait. You read that, and I'll pull

00:19:41.102 --> 00:19:43.384
this out, because I want to show it to you.

00:19:43.384 --> 00:19:49.293
MARISHA: Okay, okay. Oh man. Okay. "Well-wishes
and congrats, Keyleth, for completing her

00:19:49.293 --> 00:19:53.613
"Aramente, though now she gets to begin the stress
of becoming a leader of her tribe and working

00:19:53.613 --> 00:19:58.623
"through Vax's death, but regardless, I wanted to
make something and settled on a shawl, because

00:19:58.623 --> 00:20:16.234
"girl, how are you cold--" Oh my god! This is so
cool! This is rad. What does the back look like?

00:20:16.234 --> 00:20:19.854
I'm going to use the vanity monitor to see. It's
beautiful!

00:20:19.854 --> 00:20:22.149
TALIESIN: Looks like a microphone hookup.

00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:29.193
MARISHA: It looks like a lav. "I wanted to make
something and settled on a shawl." Because I do

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.566
sometimes get cold.

00:20:30.566 --> 00:20:31.723
TALIESIN: Are we opening the Whoppers?

00:20:31.723 --> 00:20:33.175
LAURA: Well, we will, but we also have these.

00:20:33.175 --> 00:20:36.313
MARISHA: She modeled it off of the intro video.
That's so rad.

00:20:36.313 --> 00:20:42.144
LIAM: Miles of candy. Where did Taliesin go? There
he is.

00:20:42.144 --> 00:20:49.873
MARISHA: Thank you, Maple Scribbles! This is
amazing.

00:20:49.873 --> 00:21:00.526
LAURA: This is for Brian and Denise and the
wonderful people of Talks Machina. "Thank you for

00:21:00.526 --> 00:21:08.205
"bringing such an informative, fun, creative show
each week. I hope that the TimTams lead to more

00:21:08.205 --> 00:21:14.305
"amazing times. From Shantel. Thank you ever so
much Shantel. If Brian were here, I'm sure he

00:21:14.305 --> 00:21:16.055
"would say thank you as well."

00:21:16.055 --> 00:21:17.794
DENISE: Thank you!

00:21:17.794 --> 00:21:24.474
LAURA: Black Forest TimTams, Caramel TimTams.

00:21:24.474 --> 00:21:30.784
MATT: Guys, Emerita Colleen, elf. First off, great
letter. I'm going to go ahead and read this

00:21:30.784 --> 00:21:40.095
offscreen, as per your request. However, she has made,
by hand, some miniatures. Tiny rat Grog.

00:21:40.095 --> 00:21:43.069
LAURA: Wait, she made that?!

00:21:43.069 --> 00:21:52.076
MATT: She made these with actual removable sword
of Craven Edge, which looks amazing. That's

00:21:52.076 --> 00:21:58.085
actually really cool and really well made, with
his throwing hammer and chain of returning

00:21:58.085 --> 00:22:10.255
attached, which is fantastic. There is a little
Pike that has her holy symbol and her mace, which

00:22:10.255 --> 00:22:19.874
is adorable. Little armor on and everything. And
then for you, Laura Bailey, there is your Vex,

00:22:19.874 --> 00:22:27.415
right? You have to actually string your bow, but
it's a bow with two arrows of dragon slaying

00:22:27.415 --> 00:22:28.496
attached.

00:22:28.496 --> 00:22:34.474
LAURA: What? This is crazy. Look at this
cuteness.

00:22:34.474 --> 00:22:42.706
MATT: Isn't it adorable? So we will put these on
the Talks Machina set until the corresponding

00:22:42.706 --> 00:22:44.305
individuals come to retrieve them.

00:22:44.305 --> 00:22:47.438
LAURA: This is so cute. I feel like Vanna White.

00:22:47.438 --> 00:22:55.360
MATT: Thank you so much, Emerita. These are really
amazing! I'm going to put them on set right now.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.397
LAURA: I've got to string my bow, yo.

00:22:58.397 --> 00:23:00.096
LIAM: What's up, Dani Carr?

00:23:00.096 --> 00:23:14.771
MARISHA: You startled her with her name. It's
weird. Oh God. Someone is saying my name. Okay,

00:23:14.771 --> 00:23:26.287
these are fun. This is from Brandy Ires aka
@elvyralani on Twitter. She says she has been

00:23:26.287 --> 00:23:31.456
watching us since the beginning, that she plays a
druid because of me.

00:23:31.456 --> 00:23:33.454
LIAM: Worst class.

00:23:33.454 --> 00:23:36.117
MARISHA: Suck it, rogue.

00:23:36.117 --> 00:23:37.147
LIAM: Love you.

00:23:37.147 --> 00:23:41.117
MARISHA: Love you. "I've been wanting to make you
something for quite some time, months and months

00:23:41.117 --> 00:23:46.547
"actually. While I have never been able to draw, I
am a crafter. You'll see that I made each of you a

00:23:46.547 --> 00:23:49.067
"cross stitch featuring your characters."

00:23:49.067 --> 00:23:54.318
LAURA: Is this what we saw on Twitter?

00:23:54.318 --> 00:24:00.406
MARISHA: I think so. "You might see some fun color
play across a few of them." These are her own

00:24:00.406 --> 00:24:06.356
patterns. "Matt, I am working on a special one for
you that will come at a later time."

00:24:06.356 --> 00:24:08.428
LIAM: So special.

00:24:08.428 --> 00:24:17.075
MATT: It's made of gravy. I don't know what that
means. It's been a long couple of weeks. I'm going

00:24:17.075 --> 00:24:18.267
crazy.

00:24:18.267 --> 00:24:26.907
MARISHA: Thank you so much, Brandy! Okay, ready?
Here's Scanlan Shorthalt.

00:24:26.907 --> 00:24:30.323
MATT: Trinket on a bonsai.

00:24:30.323 --> 00:24:38.738
LAURA: I unstrung it. Are you sure that's a
Trinket?

00:24:38.738 --> 00:24:43.240
MATT: It says Trinket on bonsai. There's a bunch
of pictures here of the minis they've made.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.700
LAURA: This is amazing. Thank you.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.898
MARISHA: It's a bird, you know. That makes sense.

00:24:48.898 --> 00:24:51.929
LIAM: Alt universe. I got it. Aw!

00:24:51.929 --> 00:24:59.918
MARISHA: I know. Wait, let me hold them straight.

00:24:59.918 --> 00:25:02.668
LIAM: I wish I could show these to my Grandma
O'Brien.

00:25:02.668 --> 00:25:06.889
MARISHA: Here you go, Taliesin. What's it say?

00:25:06.889 --> 00:25:12.627
TALIESIN: "I live as long as Whitestone lives."
Oh, I was preparing for, "Life needs things to--"

00:25:12.627 --> 00:25:16.378
Oh, look at it with the little mask! Oh my god!

00:25:16.378 --> 00:25:18.506
LIAM: (singing) Happiness is a cursed gun.

00:25:18.506 --> 00:25:24.395
TALIESIN: It's a really nice-- Oh, you've got it.

00:25:24.395 --> 00:25:29.379
LIAM: Yeah, man. Yeah I do. Since last week.

00:25:29.379 --> 00:25:35.268
LAURA: Oh my gosh! "It's the only way to really
grow!"

00:25:35.268 --> 00:25:46.509
MARISHA: "I would to rage!" for Grog, of course.
Pike is, "I am a monstah!" Oh my gosh!

00:25:46.509 --> 00:25:50.620
LAURA: Is Travis watching? Baby, look!

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.161
LIAM: Oh, are we a football game?

00:25:53.161 --> 00:26:01.340
LAURA: Maybe. He might have it on on his car ride.
Don't watch this while you're driving, Travis!

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.769
MARISHA: Thank you so much, Brandy! This is
amazing!

00:26:03.769 --> 00:26:08.419
LIAM: Can I see other people's? Can I see your
stack?

00:26:08.419 --> 00:26:11.259
MARISHA: Oh, "And I walk away."

00:26:11.259 --> 00:26:26.520
LIAM: Yeah, man. Thanks for the pity chuckle!
Denise, also capable of rolling a 43 on stealth.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.370
Every week.

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:32.160
LAURA: All right, bitches. Do you want to open the
coconut and lychee, the salted caramel and

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.978
vanilla-- that's my top choice-- or the Black
Forest?

00:26:34.978 --> 00:26:36.324
TALIESIN: I think salted caramel.

00:26:36.324 --> 00:26:42.411
LAURA: I think Black Forest sounds really fucking
good too. Dark chocolate and cherry, or salted

00:26:42.411 --> 00:26:43.480
caramel?

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.920
MATT: Ooh, that's a rough choice. You pick. It's
your choice, Laura. You have to decide.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.234
LAURA: Let's open both the Black Forest and the
salted caramel.

00:26:51.234 --> 00:26:52.432
MATT: There we go.

00:26:52.432 --> 00:26:54.370
LIAM: Is that your final answer?

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:59.183
LAURA: Here, you open this one.

00:26:59.183 --> 00:27:06.240
MARISHA: Dani! Dani!

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:18.789
LIAM: This one looks exciting. I'm going to
search.

00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:22.437
LAURA: I feel like, if Ashley was watching this on
her vacation, she'd want to come home from her

00:27:22.437 --> 00:27:24.854
vacation just to eat this salted caramel.

00:27:24.854 --> 00:27:28.290
MATT: Oh, it's nice and warm. Slippery.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:34.771
LIAM: What's in here is cool, but I want to see if
there's a name anywhere. No?

00:27:34.771 --> 00:27:40.831
MATT: I'm going to be an adult now and do a Tim
Tam Slam, out of red wine.

00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:48.318
MARISHA: I did do a Tim Tam slam once, when I was
in Australia. It was a very good thing.

00:27:48.318 --> 00:27:49.889
TALIESIN: Is that a thing there?

00:27:49.889 --> 00:27:52.010
MARISHA: It's something I did.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:58.301
LAURA: How is it?

00:27:58.301 --> 00:28:01.141
MATT: Pretty good, actually.

00:28:01.141 --> 00:28:09.517
LIAM: That is the only way to sneak
methamphetamines. So guys, we got some custom-made

00:28:09.517 --> 00:28:20.232
Pop! toys, and there's notes inside, so I'm just
going to hand them out. You play Percy. You play

00:28:20.232 --> 00:28:21.351
Kiki.

00:28:21.351 --> 00:28:26.342
MATT: Okay, the Black Forest Tim Tam slam with red
wine, legitimately really good.

00:28:26.342 --> 00:28:34.011
LIAM: Pass this on down to my boyfriend Shaun
Gilmore, and then we'll hold Grog and Scanlan and

00:28:34.011 --> 00:28:42.212
Pike here. I'm taking the Vax out. Taking Vax out
is a euphemism.

00:28:42.212 --> 00:28:44.438
TALIESIN: All right, this is happening.

00:28:44.438 --> 00:28:48.100
LAURA: I'm going to read my letter before I open
the present.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.592
MATT: I'm going to do the same.

00:28:49.592 --> 00:28:54.703
LAURA: This is from Carly Scott!

00:28:54.703 --> 00:28:56.611
LIAM: Who's it from?

00:28:56.611 --> 00:28:58.923
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Carly Scott!

00:28:58.923 --> 00:29:05.702
LIAM: Oh, @rudenesses is the Critter who gave me
the "Raishan Shot First" T-shirt that I wore

00:29:05.702 --> 00:29:09.528
recently! So thank you again.

00:29:09.528 --> 00:29:15.212
LAURA: By the way, she says that Vex is her
favorite. I just want to put that out there.

00:29:15.212 --> 00:29:16.892
LIAM: Oh, she meant Vax.

00:29:16.892 --> 00:29:23.493
TALIESIN: I've got to say, the amount of
unbelievable handwriting that comes my way because

00:29:23.493 --> 00:29:25.852
of this is always spectacular.

00:29:25.852 --> 00:29:33.569
LIAM: How many people are watching us reading?

00:29:33.569 --> 00:29:38.973
MATT: By the way, congrats on DMing Pathfinder.
That's awesome, by the way.

00:29:38.973 --> 00:29:47.046
MARISHA: I love it. "Yep, Florida. I know." That's
just a great one-liner in general.

00:29:47.046 --> 00:29:56.152
LAURA: Oh, I can't wait to look! And with glitter
tape, too!

00:29:56.152 --> 00:30:01.173
MARISHA: Aw, thank you so much, Carly!

00:30:01.173 --> 00:30:09.317
LAURA: Oh! And she's winking! That's adorable!

00:30:09.317 --> 00:30:29.631
MATT: Aw, look at little Gilmore! Oh my god! He's
amazing! Look at that man's majesty! I love his

00:30:29.631 --> 00:30:30.812
little cuffs!

00:30:30.812 --> 00:30:32.783
MARISHA: She's got coppery, shiny hair!

00:30:32.783 --> 00:30:40.356
LAURA: Where will this show? I'm going to put this
right behind-- can you see her behind Liam?

00:30:40.356 --> 00:30:42.553
LIAM: Oh!

00:30:42.553 --> 00:30:57.441
LAURA: That is so cute! Look at the earring! Did I
get an earring too? Oh my god, we all have

00:30:57.441 --> 00:30:58.435
earrings!

00:30:58.435 --> 00:31:07.293
MATT: Oh my god, she looks awesome! You do, you
have little sparkle earrings! Oh my god, Percy,

00:31:07.293 --> 00:31:09.047
yours looks so good!

00:31:09.047 --> 00:31:15.583
LIAM: Carly, thank you so much.

00:31:15.583 --> 00:31:18.185
MARISHA: I love our earrings.

00:31:18.185 --> 00:31:20.027
TALIESIN: The hair is really killing me.

00:31:20.027 --> 00:31:31.844
LIAM: Ugh, I love you, but ugh, you pissed me off,
but aw, I love you! Oh no, his ear didn't make it.

00:31:31.844 --> 00:31:37.361
I need some Krazy Glue for his ear! We got it.

00:31:37.361 --> 00:31:46.177
MARISHA: Okay, this is from Shantelle and she
crocheted a scarf. She said it reminded her of

00:31:46.177 --> 00:32:00.404
Keyleth's spellcasting. Wow, that's awesome! Wow,
that's crazy! How are you guys so talented? How is

00:32:00.404 --> 00:32:08.797
everyone so good? Oh, look how pretty. Hey buddy,
first Tim Tam?

00:32:08.797 --> 00:32:13.643
LIAM: Ah, screw you. Oh, it's melting in my hand.

00:32:13.643 --> 00:32:17.945
MATT: Yeah, they're a little warm.

00:32:17.945 --> 00:32:21.385
LAURA: I feel like we need music or something.

00:32:21.385 --> 00:32:25.716
DENISE: We have the fireplace.

00:32:25.716 --> 00:32:32.227
LAURA: Oh, it is? Oh, so other people can hear
that?

00:32:32.227 --> 00:32:37.712
MARISHA: Thank you, Shantelle!

00:32:37.712 --> 00:32:44.065
LIAM: I haven't had a sugar snack in weeks.

00:32:44.065 --> 00:32:49.125
MATT: All right, do we just pick one?

00:32:49.125 --> 00:32:54.516
LAURA: I don't know, maybe? This looks like
something.

00:32:54.516 --> 00:32:56.504
MATT: Sure, I'll take this one, whatever this one
is.

00:32:56.504 --> 00:33:00.473
LAURA: Wait. I can't tell.

00:33:00.473 --> 00:33:06.561
MATT: It's from Mark Ball.

00:33:06.561 --> 00:33:12.675
LAURA: This is for Vax and Percy. This is for
Marisha.

00:33:12.675 --> 00:33:18.014
MATT: "Hi Matt. Lately, I've been having
nightmares. In my dreams, you are playing the new

00:33:18.014 --> 00:33:20.987
"Mansions of Madness expansion, but with unpainted
figures, or even worse, sometimes

00:33:20.987 --> 00:33:25.566
"professionally painted miniatures. These minis
don't match up to the amateurish paint job that I

00:33:25.566 --> 00:33:28.216
"did on the core set. I don't want to live in a
world where you have to play Mansion of Madness

00:33:28.216 --> 00:33:33.704
"with mis--" Oh! You guys have the actual, the
original set with painted minis, which I still

00:33:33.704 --> 00:33:41.967
use? Oh my god! And donated $50 to the Nature
Conservancy for Marisha Ray, which is fantastic,

00:33:41.967 --> 00:33:49.794
from Mark Ball. That's incredible! Mark, it's
amazing! And the new Beyond the Threshold Mansions

00:33:49.794 --> 00:34:06.236
of Madness expansion. Wow. Oh, the minis! Oh! I'm
so happy! Oh, wow! You make me a happy man, Mark!

00:34:06.236 --> 00:34:09.766
MARISHA: That's awesome. I really want to play
now.

00:34:09.766 --> 00:34:13.368
MATT: We haven't messed with the expansion. This
is new to the second edition.

00:34:13.368 --> 00:34:17.258
MARISHA: Oh, the newest one? Ooh.

00:34:17.258 --> 00:34:19.378
MATT: This is all stuff we haven't played yet.

00:34:19.378 --> 00:34:26.188
MARISHA: This is from Lisa. She said one of her
customers brought in to sell on consignment, and

00:34:26.188 --> 00:34:32.585
she said they're pretty much the coolest earth
elemental mini she thinks she's ever seen. And she

00:34:32.585 --> 00:34:41.168
thought we could put them to good use. So let's
see here. What you got, Lisa? Oh, those are sick!

00:34:41.168 --> 00:34:53.248
Look at that! There's one. You have the other
minis.

00:34:53.248 --> 00:34:58.489
(yelling)

00:34:58.489 --> 00:35:04.149
MATT: Yeah, that's now your mini. I love the green
gems together!

00:35:04.149 --> 00:35:07.867
LAURA: I just took this from her hand. I'm sorry.

00:35:07.867 --> 00:35:14.926
MARISHA: No, it's good. Here, I'm trying to see a
little bit of a backdrop now.

00:35:14.926 --> 00:35:20.118
LAURA: It's really hard to do that. Brian does it
every week with the Wyrmwood and it's hard.

00:35:20.118 --> 00:35:22.169
MATT: That's so cool!

00:35:22.169 --> 00:35:36.159
LIAM: Lauren G. Meyers sent Taliesin and I skull
casts. Wow. Thank you so much.

00:35:36.159 --> 00:35:39.728
MARISHA: Are you going to make a--?

00:35:39.728 --> 00:35:43.848
TALIESIN: I don't know. I'm definitely going to do
something exciting with it. Something exciting's

00:35:43.848 --> 00:35:44.987
going to happen with it.

00:35:44.987 --> 00:35:46.612
LIAM: Yeah, I might be able to do something with
this soon.

00:35:46.612 --> 00:35:56.887
TALIESIN: I tapped my microphone like a terrible
person. Thank you so much. This will be added into

00:35:56.887 --> 00:35:58.368
something fun.

00:35:58.368 --> 00:36:05.347
MARISHA: Man, I recognize these! It looks like
there's another red!

00:36:05.347 --> 00:36:07.222
TALIESIN and LAURA: Oh my god!

00:36:07.222 --> 00:36:10.636
LIAM: Screw those bastards!

00:36:10.636 --> 00:36:13.640
MARISHA: Oh, what are these?

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:18.122
LAURA: Unicorns! Who are they for?

00:36:18.122 --> 00:36:24.991
MARISHA: Let's see, because we already got the
first round.

00:36:24.991 --> 00:36:26.587
LAURA: I took the white one last time.

00:36:26.587 --> 00:36:40.136
MARISHA: She said sorry for her crappy writing,
that her two-year-old was demanding her attention

00:36:40.136 --> 00:36:43.650
at the time of writing this. "Dearest Matthew
Mercer and Marisha Ray--"

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:45.491
LAURA: It's all for you.

00:36:45.491 --> 00:36:59.093
MARISHA: "Having watched the Vox Machina
methodically--" Hang on, wait. Oh, "destroy the

00:36:59.093 --> 00:37:08.114
"dragons, therefore--" Right, hang on. Aw, she
wanted us to have a complete set.

00:37:08.114 --> 00:37:11.967
MATT: That's so sweet!

00:37:11.967 --> 00:37:15.340
LAURA: It's so much work!

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:23.187
MARISHA: She knew I didn't want to give up Raishan
to Patrick, which I still haven't yet, so that we

00:37:23.187 --> 00:37:30.910
could actually give the original to Patrick and I
could have the second Raishan. This is amazing. I

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:33.229
can't believe that you went through all of this
again.

00:37:33.229 --> 00:37:42.279
LAURA: Does it say that we have to give the
pegasus to somebody specific, or does it say that,

00:37:42.279 --> 00:37:47.599
if you're at the opening of the Critmas presents,
and you really like the pink pegasus, you can have it?

00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:50.820
LIAM: Laura, take it. It's yours.

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:57.958
MARISHA: It was an alicorn to represent Gilmore.

00:37:57.958 --> 00:38:01.365
MATT: Oh, for Shaun? That's amazing.

00:38:01.365 --> 00:38:07.110
LAURA: How's that reading going for you?

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:11.504
MARISHA: And apparently, wait, gray elephant?

00:38:11.504 --> 00:38:21.792
LAURA: Wait. There's a gray dragon. Oh no! We're
missing a gray elephant!

00:38:21.792 --> 00:38:28.161
MARISHA: Right? "Also, the gray elephant is for
Taliesin." Right? That does say--?

00:38:28.161 --> 00:38:30.872
TALIESIN: It does. I think it does.

00:38:30.872 --> 00:38:34.549
MARISHA: "One blunderbuss away from becoming a
quarterman."

00:38:34.549 --> 00:38:39.239
TALIESIN: That's pretty cute. Highly entertained.

00:38:39.239 --> 00:38:45.957
MARISHA: Anyway, thank you so much, Stacy! These
are all Stacy and Glenn for round two.

00:38:45.957 --> 00:38:47.812
ALL: Thank you!

00:38:47.812 --> 00:38:50.471
MARISHA: We will read your letter in detail
later.

00:38:50.471 --> 00:38:56.799
LIAM: This one doesn't say who it's from, unless
it's from the company Field Notes Brand, but it's

00:38:56.799 --> 00:39:01.650
a bunch of little field notebooks, and I can only
believe that somebody wants the rest of us to take

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:05.013
the heat off Marisha and start taking notes.

00:39:05.013 --> 00:39:07.468
LAURA: I take notes! Just not as good as Marisha
takes.

00:39:07.468 --> 00:39:12.380
MARISHA: Well, we have pillars. You're good as the
treasury.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:16.050
LAURA: I do take really detailed treasury notes.

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:21.342
MARISHA: Yeah, you do take detailed treasury
notes, and Travis takes detailed Bag of Holding

00:39:21.342 --> 00:39:22.373
notes.

00:39:22.373 --> 00:39:31.002
MATT: All right, we have a bunch of presents here
from what looks like @ACL_TeamKilla that sent a

00:39:31.002 --> 00:39:41.605
bunch of bags of varying Skullsplitter Dice.
Different colors and types, so Laura, you can tear

00:39:41.605 --> 00:39:44.523
through as many to your heart's content of various
dice sets.

00:39:44.523 --> 00:39:46.062
LIAM: I want some! Laura doesn't get them all!

00:39:46.062 --> 00:39:47.032
LAURA: All for me!

00:39:47.032 --> 00:39:49.881
MATT: We have two large bags, so you guys have
plenty. We can go through and distribute. I'm

00:39:49.881 --> 00:39:57.403
going to put them over here. And a letter that I'm
not going to say because he's nudging things that

00:39:57.403 --> 00:39:59.291
you players need to remember anyway.

00:39:59.291 --> 00:40:05.652
LAURA: Here's a wonderful present from Kristin and
Brad, and I'm going to read this letter because

00:40:05.652 --> 00:40:07.223
it's short and it's perfect.

00:40:07.223 --> 00:40:08.782
MATT: Who wants some Bilar? Sorry.

00:40:08.782 --> 00:40:10.461
LAURA: Okay. I don't know what that is.

00:40:10.461 --> 00:40:11.793
MATT: They're like gummies.

00:40:11.793 --> 00:40:15.739
LAURA: I'll eat it. "We figured you guys were
getting tired of looking up potion types all the

00:40:15.739 --> 00:40:20.698
"time, so we made these super awesome bottles for
you to use on your adventures. One set for each

00:40:20.698 --> 00:40:28.114
"table. Each bottle contains the appropriate number
of d4s that you need for your roll, ranging from

00:40:28.114 --> 00:40:34.643
"common to supreme. Good luck, and keep being
awesome. Kristin and Brad." Kristin and Brad are

00:40:34.643 --> 00:40:39.724
super duper cool, and by the way, have we ever had
a supreme healing potion?

00:40:39.724 --> 00:40:40.722
MATT: Yeah.

00:40:40.722 --> 00:40:42.483
LAURA: We have? With 20d4?

00:40:42.483 --> 00:40:46.760
MATT: It's not 20d4.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:53.283
LAURA: Yeah, superior, eight. Supreme, 20. We've
never had a supreme.

00:40:53.283 --> 00:40:55.716
MATT: I'll double-check.

00:40:55.716 --> 00:41:01.389
TALIESIN: I had been working on putting one of
these together, and now I don't have to, which is

00:41:01.389 --> 00:41:02.451
very pleasing.

00:41:02.451 --> 00:41:03.883
LAURA: That's so cool.

00:41:03.883 --> 00:41:16.938
MARISHA: Oh, shit! I don't know who this came
from, but this is a journal, it's a leather

00:41:16.938 --> 00:41:19.215
journal, and they've got "kaitiake" stamped in
it.

00:41:19.215 --> 00:41:28.383
MATT: Oh my god, that's awesome.

00:41:28.383 --> 00:41:33.093
LAURA: Is it spelled right? Is that how you spell
"kaitiake"?

00:41:33.093 --> 00:41:40.025
MARISHA: That is the official Maori spelling of
it. I've changed it a little bit originally, but

00:41:40.025 --> 00:41:47.855
that's the original spelling, so it's accurate.
That's amazing.

00:41:47.855 --> 00:41:50.620
LAURA: The green ones don't taste as good as the
pink ones.

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:58.503
LIAM: I have a present for us here from Derek
Wilson, @cart_exists. He sent some customized

00:41:58.503 --> 00:42:03.538
coasters, two for each of us. Some of the quotes
you might remember, they stand out, like Scanlan.

00:42:03.538 --> 00:42:10.665
"You spice?" And Matthew's say "How do you
derr-de-derr-derr?" But some of them are

00:42:10.665 --> 00:42:15.743
lesser-known. Grog's is "I have an intelligence of
six, I know what I'm doing." Keyleth's says "We're

00:42:15.743 --> 00:42:26.057
"all cows, just embrace it." Percy's medium-iconic,
"I'm in the pyjamas with the butt-flap. The

00:42:26.057 --> 00:42:36.732
"butt-flap is down." Pike, "This temple goes to a
six." Vex's say, "I'm going to attack it twice,

00:42:36.732 --> 00:42:44.544
"because I'm original." And Vax's says, "She's
working for the Illuminati and we're basically the

00:42:44.544 --> 00:42:50.995
"A-Team, so I think she might know a little
better." Thank you very much, Derek.

00:42:50.995 --> 00:42:54.146
LAURA: These are for you.

00:42:54.146 --> 00:43:02.106
TALIESIN: I've got a thought. I'll show one of
them, just so they get the notion of it.

00:43:02.106 --> 00:43:11.419
MATT: I've found the right note, so @AC_teamkilla
is actually from Sweden, it says, "Greetings from

00:43:11.419 --> 00:43:15.276
"Sweden." And this is a box of their love and glory
of Grog. So most of these gifts are for Grog, so

00:43:15.276 --> 00:43:22.486
the two big bags of dice? They're for Grog. The
drinking horn in here? That's for Grog. So I'm

00:43:22.486 --> 00:43:25.484
going to put those in here, and you can bring
those home to Travis, and he can enjoy and

00:43:25.484 --> 00:43:27.346
distribute as he sees fit.

00:43:27.346 --> 00:43:31.376
LIAM: No, no, Travis said that anything that he
got when he's not here goes to me, so I will take

00:43:31.376 --> 00:43:32.796
those home.

00:43:32.796 --> 00:43:41.219
MATT: Gave me metal dwarven dice as well. That's
fantastic. That is really, really cool.

00:43:41.219 --> 00:43:48.663
LAURA: Oh my gosh, wait. This is from-- hold on,
I've got to see who it's from, because this is

00:43:48.663 --> 00:43:57.416
really cool. This is from Jay Anthony Pierpoli and
the rest of the Critter community, who sent,

00:43:57.416 --> 00:44:02.854
number one, a fanfiction that I will definitely
read that they say is phenomenal by Sarah Louise

00:44:02.854 --> 00:44:09.967
Harper. And also, this is so cool, I wish Sam was
here. I'm opening his present for him, because I

00:44:09.967 --> 00:44:11.646
like opening things.

00:44:11.646 --> 00:44:12.817
MATT: What?!

00:44:12.817 --> 00:44:16.842
LAURA: It's a wrap for his giant mug.

00:44:16.842 --> 00:44:20.036
(exclamations)

00:44:20.036 --> 00:44:22.307
MATT: That is incredible. Look at the leather-work
on that!

00:44:22.307 --> 00:44:35.872
LAURA: I know, it's amazing! He said he made it
before he realized Scanlan was not here. How cool

00:44:35.872 --> 00:44:37.327
is this?

00:44:37.327 --> 00:44:39.335
MATT: That's badass. Little holders, too!

00:44:39.335 --> 00:44:43.367
LAURA: Insane! Where's his little mug? Is it up
here?

00:44:43.367 --> 00:44:45.545
MATT: Let me check. I'll go get it.

00:44:45.545 --> 00:44:54.578
TALIESIN: I'm going to do this and hope to not
make a mess. Hah. Oh, wow, we've lost Matt. Oh

00:44:54.578 --> 00:44:56.687
yeah, the mug's probably in the-- yeah.

00:44:56.687 --> 00:45:06.058
MARISHA: Oh, that's awesome. John and Deb O'Brien
sent a copy of one of their favorite bands for us

00:45:06.058 --> 00:45:17.036
to listen to. So thank you so much, John and Deb.
And then-- oh, I see what you're doing.

00:45:17.036 --> 00:45:23.380
LAURA: We have to put it on so he'll have it in
the next show when he finally brings his mug out

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:30.529
again. Oh my god! It looks so cool.

00:45:30.529 --> 00:45:34.488
MATT: We're not going to tell him about it. He'll
just find it with it on.

00:45:34.488 --> 00:45:49.426
LAURA: Oh man. I don't have anything. I'll take
it.

00:45:49.426 --> 00:45:57.240
MARISHA: Okay, Matt, this is from Beth Fleven.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:04.264
LAURA: From Joseph, we need to remember it's from
Joseph.

00:46:04.264 --> 00:46:08.032
MARISHA: She sent us something in a diapers box. I
don't know if that's--

00:46:08.032 --> 00:46:16.030
TALIESIN: I think she's sick and tired of us
getting up in the middle of the game. Message

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:20.440
received. That will be the last time you saw any
of us get up in the middle of the game.

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:31.290
LIAM: Check this out. Check this out.

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:32.974
LAURA: So ridiculous.

00:46:32.974 --> 00:46:38.753
(laughter)

00:46:38.753 --> 00:46:43.370
LIAM: Best t-shirt I've ever been sent. Of all the
other t-shirts I've been sent, this is the best

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:45.531
one. Look at that!

00:46:45.531 --> 00:46:48.181
MARISHA: That is a very fluorescent orange shirt.

00:46:48.181 --> 00:46:50.421
LIAM: Yes, and I will don it proudly.

00:46:50.421 --> 00:46:52.041
MARISHA: Go jogging in that shirt.

00:46:52.041 --> 00:46:53.156
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

00:46:53.156 --> 00:46:56.685
(laughter)

00:46:56.685 --> 00:47:04.504
TALIESIN: Oh my. This is from @irish_mike. "To
Taliesin: To conquer your fear, you must face it.

00:47:04.504 --> 00:47:14.274
"Stay beautiful." And I got a bag of Swedish Fish.
I fear these, but not for the same reason. Thank

00:47:14.274 --> 00:47:21.530
you. Thank you very much. Oh, I'm going to be in
trouble when I bring these home. Oh, this is so

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:22.532
exciting.

00:47:22.532 --> 00:47:28.242
LIAM: This print-art shirt is from Jeff Kielessen,
who lives where many of my kin live.

00:47:28.242 --> 00:47:44.518
MARISHA: Okay, so Beth wrote a letter to Matt and
I, but the gift is for Liam. Beth is thanking us

00:47:44.518 --> 00:47:52.577
for the game, she says, "Enclosed in this box is a
handmade gift for Liam. I began making it just

00:47:52.577 --> 00:48:00.031
"after he defeated Thordak. I thought it fitting
that the slayer of Thordak should have one of the

00:48:00.031 --> 00:48:05.171
"eggs to keep as a trophy." There you go, bud.

00:48:05.171 --> 00:48:33.236
LIAM: Can I see the letter? Hold on. Oh, man. Oh,
I got a letter, too. I'm going to read the letter

00:48:33.236 --> 00:48:35.333
first. No, you all are waiting on me.

00:48:35.333 --> 00:48:36.902
LAURA: No, too bad, I'm doing this one.

00:48:36.902 --> 00:48:46.513
LIAM: Look at this amazing motherfucker right
here. Oh, yes! Yes. Ah, facehugger's in it!

00:48:46.513 --> 00:48:53.069
MATT: I did it! It's on. That is ridiculous.

00:48:53.069 --> 00:48:54.369
LAURA: How heavy is that?

00:48:54.369 --> 00:48:56.595
MATT: What, the whole thing? It's got a nice heft
to it.

00:48:56.595 --> 00:49:00.426
(laughter)

00:49:00.426 --> 00:49:01.590
MATT: Now fill it with liquid.

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:05.277
LAURA: Oh my god. How does he pick this up? Does
he pick it up one-handed?

00:49:05.277 --> 00:49:07.247
MATT: Gnome strength.

00:49:07.247 --> 00:49:10.328
LAURA: What does he put on the bottom? Oh, it's
his little code.

00:49:10.328 --> 00:49:15.127
TALIESIN: Where is this from? This is "To Matthew
Mercer." Where is this from?

00:49:15.127 --> 00:49:18.891
MARISHA: From Elliott Cole from Australia.

00:49:18.891 --> 00:49:28.444
MATT: What is in the thing? What are you finding
in the thing?

00:49:28.444 --> 00:49:32.455
TALIESIN: All right, let's see what happened.

00:49:32.455 --> 00:49:34.008
LAURA: Oh, wow!

00:49:34.008 --> 00:49:36.426
MATT: What?

00:49:36.426 --> 00:49:51.008
LAURA: I know! This is so cool! This is from
Jennifer Knight. She designed this and stitched it

00:49:51.008 --> 00:49:57.459
herself, with a panel for each character, and
these panels are super duper detailed.

00:49:57.459 --> 00:49:59.826
MATT: I love the frame on this.

00:49:59.826 --> 00:50:09.763
LAURA: The frame is awesome! The freaking
stitching is awesome! With museum glass.

00:50:09.763 --> 00:50:13.523
MATT: Where a bunch of nerdy-ass voice actors roll
dice and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Aw!

00:50:13.549 --> 00:50:17.212
LAURA: Look at these panels! This is so cool!

00:50:17.212 --> 00:50:19.919
MARISHA: That's so great!

00:50:19.919 --> 00:50:23.573
LAURA: We should hang this on set.

00:50:23.573 --> 00:50:25.946
MATT: That's fantastic.

00:50:25.946 --> 00:50:30.838
TALIESIN: I'm actually excited because we have
room for art suddenly because we just redecorated

00:50:30.838 --> 00:50:31.891
a bit.

00:50:31.891 --> 00:50:34.152
LAURA: Oh wow, it's really well done.

00:50:34.152 --> 00:50:36.329
LIAM: Beth, thank you, and thank you.

00:50:36.329 --> 00:50:42.389
MARISHA: Amazing! What's happening?

00:50:42.389 --> 00:50:44.640
TALIESIN: I don't know what this is. But things
are happening.

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:57.670
MATT: Progress is occurring. (singing) Freedom!
Sweet freedom, freedom! You've got to give what

00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:59.319
you take.

00:50:59.319 --> 00:51:01.890
TALIESIN: They wrapped this very well.

00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:05.790
MATT: Whatever it was is in seven pieces.

00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:07.740
TALIESIN: Another door!

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:12.319
MATT: It's just a small door. It would make so
much sense.

00:51:12.319 --> 00:51:15.500
MARISHA: Are you getting it out?

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:17.191
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're getting there.

00:51:17.191 --> 00:51:19.577
MATT: I'm so curious now.

00:51:19.577 --> 00:51:24.283
TALIESIN: It's just an infinite amount of
wrapping! All the way down.

00:51:24.283 --> 00:51:30.099
MARISHA: Oh my God! You guys!

00:51:30.099 --> 00:51:35.163
MATT: What? It's a guitar.

00:51:35.163 --> 00:51:36.995
LAURA: It's pink.

00:51:36.995 --> 00:51:40.321
LIAM: What! Whoa! Oh my God!

00:51:40.321 --> 00:51:45.111
MATT: (yelling) What?!

00:51:45.111 --> 00:51:49.392
LAURA: That is so cool!

00:51:49.392 --> 00:51:52.632
LIAM: On the set!

00:51:52.632 --> 00:51:57.891
MATT: (Gilmore voice) "That is glorious. What else 
can you say but, that's glorious?"

00:51:57.979 --> 00:52:00.147
LAURA: Do you want to hold this, Matthew?

00:52:00.147 --> 00:52:05.922
MATT: "Now you know where to shop, am I
right?" That is incredible!

00:52:05.985 --> 00:52:08.315
LAURA: I feel like we just won the lottery.

00:52:08.315 --> 00:52:15.836
MATT: Look in the back, it has our symbol engraved!
Elliott Cole, incredible work, Elliott! That is

00:52:15.836 --> 00:52:24.140
amazing! One day at home I'm like, "You know, just
make up some magic shop with some dude named

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:28.737
"Gilmore." Years later-- That's amazing.

00:52:28.737 --> 00:52:33.505
LAURA: I wonder if it'll fit in one of those boxes
above Trinket's head.

00:52:33.505 --> 00:52:35.036
MATT: It's a bit big for one of those.

00:52:35.036 --> 00:52:41.146
LAURA: Oh, I mean the cross-stitching. Gilmore can
maybe go right there next to the other Gilmore!

00:52:41.146 --> 00:52:43.639
Gilmore is world famous.

00:52:43.639 --> 00:52:45.320
MATT: I just want this in front of our house now.

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:49.487
LAURA: I know, right! Can you just hang that in
your living room? I wouldn't blame you if you want

00:52:49.487 --> 00:52:50.847
to take it.

00:52:50.847 --> 00:52:54.198
MATT: It's incredible! Holy shit! Oh man, it
should live on set for a little while at least.

00:52:54.198 --> 00:52:55.666
Then I'm going to take it home.

00:52:55.666 --> 00:52:57.799
LAURA: Just above your bed?

00:52:57.799 --> 00:52:59.797
TALIESIN: We need more hooks. We definitely need
more hooks.

00:52:59.797 --> 00:53:07.488
LAURA: Yeah. Oh gosh, careful; those were hung
pretty precariously. But that's okay! No, it's

00:53:07.488 --> 00:53:10.797
great. We'll rearrange our--

00:53:10.797 --> 00:53:20.268
(yelling)

00:53:20.268 --> 00:53:21.389
LAURA: That's really remarkable.

00:53:21.389 --> 00:53:22.719
MATT: I can't function right now.

00:53:22.719 --> 00:53:25.365
LAURA: It's done so well!

00:53:25.398 --> 00:53:28.114
MATT: It's done &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; well. Have you seen it up
close?

00:53:28.114 --> 00:53:35.838
TALIESIN: I have not seen it up close. Oh my God,
really? What lunacy. What lunacy is this?

00:53:35.838 --> 00:53:50.775
LIAM: This is something for Sam. So many Critters
were involved in this. So many! This is a list of

00:53:50.775 --> 00:53:53.146
the Critters involved in the making of this.

00:53:53.146 --> 00:53:56.874
LAURA: Is that the same people who do the quotes?
It's a quilt?

00:53:56.874 --> 00:53:59.117
LIAM: Yeah. This for Sam, we should show it on air,
right?

00:53:59.117 --> 00:54:04.213
LAURA: Oh, I feel like Sam should be the one that
opens it up, though. It's his quilt?

00:54:04.213 --> 00:54:08.945
LIAM: But like, don't we want to acknowledge the
work put into this?

00:54:08.945 --> 00:54:13.747
LAURA: Maybe we can give it to him on Thursday.
Because I loved mine.

00:54:13.747 --> 00:54:20.035
LIAM: Okay. God, I recognize so many names on this
list. Yeah, that's what we'll do. We'll bring it

00:54:20.035 --> 00:54:22.439
on Thursday on the top of the show.

00:54:22.439 --> 00:54:29.852
LAURA: What happened?

00:54:29.852 --> 00:54:35.513
TALIESIN: The note went-- The tape's not sticking
anymore and it just gave me a mild heart attack.

00:54:35.513 --> 00:54:37.341
That's all.

00:54:37.341 --> 00:54:38.825
LIAM: For Sam for later.

00:54:38.825 --> 00:54:46.278
MARISHA: Okay, I think these are fun. That one
goes to Liam. This one's Taliesin, Laura, and

00:54:46.278 --> 00:54:52.465
Matt. We already pulled Ashley and Sam's and
Travis' and put them over there. Isn't it

00:54:52.465 --> 00:54:53.432
adorable?

00:54:53.432 --> 00:54:59.053
LAURA: Oh yeah, read the card!

00:54:59.053 --> 00:55:09.293
MARISHA: Oh, they put 'Risha' on here. I haven't
been called Risha since high school.

00:55:09.293 --> 00:55:16.726
MATT: "There once was a DM called Matt/He could
swap characters at the drop of a hat/His city he

"burned/But his trust was returned/And his story

ALL: Aww.

LAURA: "What can I say about lovely Laura/Her
friends and the fandom adore her/Her comebacks are

LAURA: If you read that sarcastically...

MARISHA: "Marisha, a word to the wise/There are
those in the world who despise/Rise above the

MATT: That's amazing!

00:55:56.046 --> 00:55:57.529
LIAM: Is that a feat you took?

00:55:57.529 --> 00:56:00.319
LAURA: Chun Li thighs?

00:56:00.319 --> 00:56:08.366
TALIESIN: "It's hard to write rhymes about

MARISHA: Oh, I can think of a few.

00:56:14.839 --> 00:56:16.296
TALIESIN: I can think of a few, too.

00:56:16.296 --> 00:56:22.367
LIAM: "There once was a swell guy named Liam/Many
players just wanted to be him/He often played

LIAM: No, seriously, it's life or death. There's
nothing to joke about. This is Dungeons and

Dragons.

00:56:41.764 --> 00:56:43.688
MATT: Thank you so much, Vee, these are so cute!

00:56:43.688 --> 00:56:47.400
LAURA: What did you do?

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:56.958
MATT: They're all shirts of my face. What? What?!

00:56:56.958 --> 00:57:00.955
LAURA: They're team hoodies! They are team
hoodies!

00:57:00.955 --> 00:57:03.501
MARISHA: Oh my god, mine says 'Keteor'!

00:57:03.501 --> 00:57:06.738
LIAM: #FateTouched.

00:57:06.738 --> 00:57:09.843
MARISHA: Hunter's Mark. What's yours?

00:57:09.843 --> 00:57:21.380
MATT: That's incredible.

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:24.189
LAURA: Team hoodies! Just in case you guys didn't
know who I am.

00:57:24.189 --> 00:57:28.429
MATT: Layering all the sweaters right now.
Multi-hood.

00:57:28.429 --> 00:57:29.969

LIAM: Oh my goodness gracious. Oh my goodness.
We've got to go bowling right after the show.

00:57:41.258 --> 00:57:43.828
LAURA: (gasps) We have to go bowling in our
hoodies!

00:57:43.828 --> 00:57:47.219
OFFSCREEN: Nerdiest biker gang.

00:57:47.219 --> 00:57:52.219
MATT: Yeah, you're not wrong.

00:57:52.219 --> 00:57:56.980
LAURA: Can we just all go somewhere in our hoodies?

00:57:56.980 --> 00:58:02.509
MATT: This is ridiculous.

00:58:02.509 --> 00:58:08.420
LAURA: That's awesome. Wait, who's that from?
That's from Vee. But I can't see the full name, it

00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:09.699
just says Vee!

00:58:09.699 --> 00:58:11.499
MATT: And we got chocolates from her, too.

00:58:11.499 --> 00:58:12.866
LAURA: And she gave chocolates.

00:58:12.866 --> 00:58:14.569
MATT: Thank you, Vee, you're amazing!

00:58:14.569 --> 00:58:15.770
LAURA: Or he!

00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:17.723
MARISHA: And chocolate.

00:58:17.723 --> 00:58:19.952
MATT: It's Vee. You don't know what Vee is.

00:58:19.952 --> 00:58:31.110
LAURA: You have so many more boxes.

00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:34.312
MATT: I just like making Max do stuff, actually.

00:58:34.312 --> 00:58:40.717
TALIESIN: I'm getting a little warm, actually. I
was okay, and then I realized, no, I'm cooking a

00:58:40.717 --> 00:58:42.220
little bit.

00:58:42.220 --> 00:59:01.373
MATT: From @lightningsource, the book of-- what?
What?! 5e game supplement, The Book of the

00:59:01.373 --> 00:59:03.009
Tarrasque.

00:59:03.009 --> 00:59:05.800
LAURA: What is-- oh no! That's the scary guy,
right?

00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:08.711
MATT: No, no, he's fun, he's the teddy bear of
D&amp;amp;D.

00:59:08.711 --> 00:59:11.085
LAURA: Is that the big scary figure that I saw at
your house?

00:59:11.085 --> 00:59:12.430
MATT: No.

00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:14.642
MARISHA: He's lying, Laura, he's lying!

00:59:14.642 --> 00:59:16.049
MATT: That one, you mean?

00:59:16.049 --> 00:59:17.810
LAURA: (yells) Yeah, that one.

00:59:17.810 --> 00:59:29.961
MATT: That's so cool! It's like a tarrasque
coloring book/adventure module-- oh my god, this

00:59:29.961 --> 00:59:37.683
book is so cute! It's so awesome! With a foreword
by Ed Greenwood. Yeah, baby. Got some Forgotten

00:59:37.683 --> 00:59:39.550
Realms blood in this.

00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:45.301
MARISHA: Someone sent Chozo fine quality coffee.

00:59:45.301 --> 00:59:49.719
LAURA: Maybe there's weed in there! That's how
people--

00:59:49.719 --> 00:59:52.882
MARISHA: Send weed. Where does it open?

00:59:52.882 --> 00:59:57.071
LAURA: You didn't hear that from us. I just had
heard that on the internet.

00:59:57.071 --> 01:00:03.391
MATT: I'm genuinely excited because the base rules
for the tarrasque in 5e are all right, but there

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:06.672
are some cool elements of the tarrasque from
previous editions that didn't make it in. This has

01:00:06.672 --> 01:00:10.065
a whole separate page for optional tarrasque
rules, which include things like its tiered

01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:15.581
regeneration, which I kind of miss, and other cool
elements. The rush-- oh my god, trample--

01:00:15.581 --> 01:00:22.220
(cackles) I'm so excited! This is so cool! I
didn't know this book existed! I'm so happy! Who

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:28.532
sent this? I don't know who sent this. This is
from @lightningsource. I guess?

01:00:28.532 --> 01:00:32.933
TALIESIN: See if there's a slip of paper.
Sometimes there's a little slip of paper.

01:00:32.933 --> 01:00:39.689
MATT: I'm looking! Whoever sent this, you're
amazing, thank you! I don't see. Tell me. Message

01:00:39.689 --> 01:00:41.822
me or e-mail me. Thank you, that's so awesome.

01:00:41.822 --> 01:00:46.257
(off-screen laughter)

01:00:46.257 --> 01:00:49.931
MATT: Don't laugh at me. I'm forever 12, okay?

01:00:49.931 --> 01:00:52.893
TALIESIN: (laughs)

01:00:52.893 --> 01:00:55.370
MATT: Taliesin, you can laugh at me if you want.

01:00:55.370 --> 01:01:00.216
TALIESIN: I was about to say, I feel like I've
earned that right. I've seen things. Terrible,

01:01:00.216 --> 01:01:01.845
terrible things.

01:01:01.845 --> 01:01:13.962
MATT: What? I got a-- "Guaranteed forever, Husky
utility knives". That's actually extremely handy.

01:01:13.962 --> 01:01:22.052
LAURA: He's set. He's three daggers in. I've got a
tag on the inside of my sleeve. I've got to get it out.

01:01:22.052 --> 01:01:25.276
MATT: Well, thank you, whoever sent utility
knives.

01:01:25.276 --> 01:01:26.983
TALIESIN: Is there a note with--

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:36.465
MATT: Oh, there you go. Here we go. There it is.
"Hi Matt. After watching you post Christmas

01:01:36.465 --> 01:01:39.624
"holiday on Periscope with Marisha and Taliesin and
Brian, I thought these might come in handy. Love

01:01:39.624 --> 01:01:44.387
"the show and everything you do. Please avoid
needing stitches. Casey Wall." Yep, you knew

01:01:44.387 --> 01:01:46.958
exactly what I was talking about. Those are
actually going to be really handy. That's so

01:01:46.958 --> 01:01:48.222
awesome. Thank you so much.

01:01:48.222 --> 01:01:49.523
MARISHA: They sent box-cutters?

01:01:49.523 --> 01:01:55.764
MATT: Yeah. We kept losing ours, and we couldn't
find the one of the two we had, and then two

01:01:55.764 --> 01:01:57.932
disappeared. Thank you very much.

01:01:57.932 --> 01:02:07.860
LIAM: All right. Vicky Banks made us individual
goodie bags with different things in them. I'm

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:12.495
going to pass yours down. There's a letter with
each. I read the overall letter. Thank you,

01:02:12.495 --> 01:02:13.471
Vicky.

01:02:13.471 --> 01:02:15.432
MATT: Thank you, Vicky.

01:02:15.432 --> 01:02:19.100
LIAM: The bags are individualized. I got a theatre
nerd bag.

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.394
LAURA: Of course.

01:02:20.394 --> 01:02:22.797
TALIESIN: I have "Life needs things to live."

01:02:22.797 --> 01:02:24.500
LAURA: Ooh, that's Marisha's.

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:28.628
MARISHA: "Call me 'child' one more time."

01:02:28.628 --> 01:02:33.654
LAURA: With Hamilton on the bag! Did you guys get
Hamilton on the back of yours?

01:02:33.654 --> 01:02:37.161
MATT: Mine has the Witcher symbol on it, I'm so
happy. It has the medallion.

01:02:37.161 --> 01:02:40.002
MARISHA: Mine has little grasping vines.

01:02:40.002 --> 01:02:49.420
TALIESIN: Ooh! Ooh, a Thor's hammer on a string,
excellent. I will wear that.

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:50.891
LAURA: Oh, cool.

01:02:50.891 --> 01:02:54.954
MARISHA: I got a wine cork. They know. They know.

01:02:54.954 --> 01:02:58.232
TALIESIN: Oh, blue glitter. No, that will go. I
know what that is.

01:02:58.232 --> 01:03:04.029
MARISHA: Oh, this is adorable. It's because I am
the winespeaker. Eat, drink, and be married.

01:03:04.029 --> 01:03:06.585
LAURA: Oh, that's wonderful.

01:03:06.585 --> 01:03:14.595
LIAM: Oh, hi, you guys. Do you like my new hat?

01:03:14.595 --> 01:03:17.153
MATT: That's fantastic.

01:03:17.153 --> 01:03:36.264
LIAM: I don't know what you're laughing at. What's
this? I don't know what this is.

01:03:36.264 --> 01:03:42.483
MARISHA: Okay, this is an amazing letter.

01:03:42.483 --> 01:03:45.586
LIAM: (Gollum voice) What is it?

01:03:45.586 --> 01:04:01.284
MARISHA: This is an amazing letter from Marsha
Hanif, or @1opinonated on Twitter, and she tells

01:04:01.284 --> 01:04:06.184
this amazing story about her and--

01:04:06.184 --> 01:04:08.894
MATT: Too many heads.

01:04:08.894 --> 01:04:15.100
MARISHA: --about one of her characters getting
into a fight because she didn't want to get thrown

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:19.737
into a fight that they couldn't handle on their
mission, and it reminded her of Keyleth versus

01:04:19.737 --> 01:04:30.785
Kima in the Underdark and how much their game has
become better by watching Critical Role. Thank you

01:04:30.785 --> 01:04:37.583
so much for all the kind words, Marsha, this is
amazing. Truly amazing.

01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:41.652
MATT: Got an awesome Matthew bottle opener. Sorry,
I'm still going through Vicky's present.

01:04:41.652 --> 01:04:43.139
LAURA: Yeah, me too.

01:04:43.139 --> 01:04:44.718
TALIESIN: I know, it's got layers.

01:04:44.718 --> 01:04:55.125
MARISHA: Gloves and hat. Oh, this is so cute!

01:04:55.125 --> 01:05:05.826
MATT: When the DM smiles, it's already too late.
That's awesome. Mercer '82.

01:05:05.826 --> 01:05:13.676
LAURA: I got a DCA: Dice Collectors Anonymous
t-shirt.

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:16.426
MATT: It's about time you finally admitted you had
a problem, Laura.

01:05:16.426 --> 01:05:19.390
ALL: Thank you, Vicky.

01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:26.518
MATT: These are so cute! Oh my god. I love the
bag, too.

01:05:26.518 --> 01:05:29.035
LAURA: That's adorable.

01:05:29.035 --> 01:05:31.316
TALIESIN: Thank you so much.

01:05:31.316 --> 01:05:46.241
MATT: These are from Dennis Archimbault Jr. I
should not read things from the side. Dennis

01:05:46.241 --> 01:05:55.767
Archimbault Jr. sends a bag that is-- it's a pizza
box.

01:05:55.767 --> 01:05:59.207
TALIESIN: Also, it's been over 30 minutes, so it's
free.

01:05:59.207 --> 01:06:15.495
LIAM: It's kidneys. It could be a dead thing.

01:06:15.495 --> 01:06:18.648
MATT: Oh, what?

01:06:18.648 --> 01:06:22.551
LAURA: What is that?

01:06:22.551 --> 01:06:36.009
MATT: Oh my god. This is a person's entire
Warhammer ogre army collection, handpainted by

01:06:36.009 --> 01:06:48.678
them. All of their individual Warhammer ogre
minis. This is awesome. They said they haven't

01:06:48.678 --> 01:06:53.775
touched them in about five years, so "in interest
of the minis finding a better life than spending

01:06:53.775 --> 01:07:00.378
"eternity on a shelf, decided to bequeath them unto
you." I hit my microphone, sorry. These are

01:07:00.378 --> 01:07:05.558
amazing. These handpainted ogres.

01:07:05.558 --> 01:07:10.629
LAURA: I mean, they're really detailed. Look at
that guy!

01:07:10.629 --> 01:07:17.560
MATT: Dennis, not only did you do an amazing job
on painting these, but I have all the ogres-- oh

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:25.028
yeah, I know that guy. That's incredible. The
ogres are some of the cooler models in the old

01:07:25.028 --> 01:07:31.065
Warhammer fantasy stuff. That one, let's pull it
out, let's see what he's all about.

01:07:31.065 --> 01:07:32.777
LAURA: He's got like a mask.

01:07:32.777 --> 01:07:34.082
LIAM: Yeah, what is that?

01:07:34.082 --> 01:07:43.509
LAURA: What's this thing? (gasps) It's a little
goblin in there! And he goes on his back. Goblin

01:07:43.509 --> 01:07:45.448
down, goblin down!

01:07:45.448 --> 01:07:53.927
MATT: There he goes. He's got like a standard with
a little goblin riding on his back. That's so

01:07:53.927 --> 01:07:59.977
cool! Dennis, you're amazing! I will take good
care of this. Thank you so much.

01:07:59.977 --> 01:08:06.258
LIAM: You're turning into one of those old ladies
from Labyrinth with the 500 things on her back.

01:08:06.258 --> 01:08:07.859
MARISHA: Yeah, totally.

01:08:07.859 --> 01:08:15.522
LAURA: A really eclectic grandma.

01:08:15.522 --> 01:08:20.406
MARISHA: Hey, Matt. Are you okay with this being
your future?

01:08:20.406 --> 01:08:27.149
MATT: Oh, I was just assuming we'd both be bag
people eventually. I make no illusions.

01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:32.921
MARISHA: I've got to get over to the 99-cent store
before they close for the day.

01:08:32.921 --> 01:08:40.973
MATT: We live in the Valley, we die in the Valley,
all right? Thank you so much, Dennis.

01:08:40.973 --> 01:08:44.989
LIAM: "Do you have any purple soda left?"

01:08:44.989 --> 01:08:48.112
MATT: Dennis, oh my god. Oh my god.

01:08:48.112 --> 01:08:58.502
LAURA: Is that full? Oh my god. Did we open
everything?

01:08:58.502 --> 01:09:06.795
MARISHA: Well, this is a really big one that--
guess who's in? You know what this is.

01:09:06.795 --> 01:09:14.499
(gasping)

01:09:14.499 --> 01:09:17.028
MATT: The Conclave is complete!

01:09:17.028 --> 01:09:19.733
LAURA: Oh gosh, oh gosh, here's the letter.

01:09:19.733 --> 01:09:20.977
MATT: Read the letter.

01:09:20.977 --> 01:09:31.153
LAURA: Okay, okay, I'm reading it. This is to the
cast of Critical Role. Wow. "Congratulations. The

01:09:31.153 --> 01:09:35.777
"adventure that spanned nearly a year, taking our
intrepid heroes across the planes of existence to

01:09:35.777 --> 01:09:40.638
"the very threshold of death's door and back, has
finally come to an end. Enclosed is the mounted

01:09:40.638 --> 01:09:45.968
"head of the final member of the Chroma Conclave to
fall to the valiant Vox Machina, Raishan, the

01:09:45.968 --> 01:09:51.909
"Diseased Deceiver." This is so cool. "What an
adventure this has been. This little undertaking

01:09:51.909 --> 01:09:55.712
"started just as a fun project to work on with my
sister, and thank you all for the wonderful work

01:09:55.712 --> 01:09:59.373
"that you do to bring this amazing story to so
many, but it quickly turned into something much

01:09:59.373 --> 01:10:03.596
"more important than that. It was the spark that
reignited my passion for my craft and rekindled my

01:10:03.596 --> 01:10:07.401
"love for the wonderful shared storytelling
experience of Dungeons and Dragons, and for that,

01:10:07.401 --> 01:10:12.009
"I can't thank you enough. With the death of the
final member of the Chroma Conclave--"

01:10:12.009 --> 01:10:25.359
(exclaiming)

01:10:25.359 --> 01:10:27.066
MARISHA: I love that they're to scale.

01:10:27.066 --> 01:10:32.194
LAURA: You've just got to lance them, you know.
Sometimes you've got to go to the doctor, even, if

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:33.370
it's too big--

01:10:33.370 --> 01:10:35.170
LIAM: Do it at home with a pencil.

01:10:35.170 --> 01:10:37.989
LAURA: It's satisfying, I think.

01:10:37.989 --> 01:10:40.878
LIAM: You gave me that mirror.

01:10:40.878 --> 01:10:42.219
TALIESIN: Oh no.

01:10:42.219 --> 01:10:54.768
LAURA: "With the death of the final--" That's just
scary. Don't do this. "With the death of the final

01:10:54.768 --> 01:10:58.222
"member of the Chroma Conclave, it brings this
wonderful project and my own adventure to a close.

01:10:58.222 --> 01:11:02.250
"It has a been a truly incredible experience to be
able to share my sister's and my talents with you

01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:06.940
"all, and with the amazing Critters. We now embark
to find our next project and see where that will

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:11.681
"take us. If I could make one request: when you get
all of the mounts hung, could you get us a picture

01:11:11.681 --> 01:11:15.215
"of the set, please? That would make me and my
sister two very happy Critters."

01:11:15.215 --> 01:11:23.077
MATT: Oh, don't worry. I love in the back it's
written here "HDYWTDT, Kerrek, 1-27-2017". They

01:11:23.077 --> 01:11:28.197
signed it. "They have weathered the Iron Storm,
starved the Hope Devourer, thawed the Frigid Doom,

01:11:28.197 --> 01:11:33.049
"eradicated the Diseased Deceiver, and extinguished
the Cinder King. They are Vox Machina."

01:11:33.049 --> 01:11:38.026
(cheering)

01:11:38.026 --> 01:11:43.616
LAURA: Also says, "Liam, the offer still stands."
Do you know what this is? "If you or your kids

01:11:43.616 --> 01:11:48.781
"would like a custom trophy mount to commemorate
their victory over a mighty foe", they'd be happy

01:11:48.781 --> 01:11:50.020
to send one your way.

01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:51.470
LIAM: Oh, wow. I'll take that.

01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:55.688
MATT: You were my favorite villains.

01:11:55.688 --> 01:11:58.045
TALIESIN: So far.

01:11:58.045 --> 01:12:00.723
MATT: I was hoping you'd live until the next
campaign.

01:12:00.723 --> 01:12:03.085
LAURA: Oh, too bad Vox Machina killed you.

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:06.303
MATT: Yeah. That's okay. It was a fitting end.

01:12:06.303 --> 01:12:07.810
LIAM: We saved thousands.

01:12:07.810 --> 01:12:13.953
MATT: You did in the long run. How cool is that?
Check it out.

01:12:13.953 --> 01:12:15.189
LAURA: How heavy is it?

01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:18.578
MATT: It's pretty light, actually. Thordak's the
big, heavy one, as it should be.

01:12:18.578 --> 01:12:21.156
MARISHA: I love that they're all kind of to scale
based on--

01:12:21.156 --> 01:12:24.389
LAURA: Wow, I can't wait to see all of them hung
up next to each other.

01:12:24.389 --> 01:12:30.264
LIAM: Also, I can't wait, I hope to live to see
that after civilization falls and you guys trick

01:12:30.264 --> 01:12:33.571
out your Mad Max car with five dragon heads on
it.

01:12:33.571 --> 01:12:36.035
MATT: Don't you even worry.

01:12:36.035 --> 01:12:38.725
LAURA: I feel like these are just too fragile to
be in a car fight.

01:12:38.725 --> 01:12:44.104
LIAM: Well, if we all have shotguns, we'll keep
the attackers away.

01:12:44.104 --> 01:12:46.433
MATT: We're not fighting with the dragon heads,
they're just intimidation tactics.

01:12:46.433 --> 01:12:49.313
LAURA: No, but I'm saying if they're hanging on
the front of your Mad Max car, they're going to

01:12:49.313 --> 01:12:50.743
get damaged!

01:12:50.743 --> 01:12:53.342
MATT: Yeah. We'll figure it out.

01:12:53.342 --> 01:12:54.992
LIAM: Yeah, but they'll be witnessed.

01:12:54.992 --> 01:12:59.365
LAURA: They will be witnessed. Witness me!

01:12:59.365 --> 01:13:02.511
MATT: Oh, is this something?

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:05.341
LAURA: Where should I put this so it doesn't get
damaged?

01:13:05.341 --> 01:13:07.033
OFF-SCREEN: I think that should go on the set.

01:13:07.033 --> 01:13:08.933
TALIESIN: Actually--

01:13:08.933 --> 01:13:15.479
MATT: Well, no, I'm thinking, now that we have all
the heads and if we get the new set finished, we

01:13:15.479 --> 01:13:17.063
might put them all up in the new set.

01:13:17.063 --> 01:13:19.893
TALIESIN: We've got the wall as well.

01:13:19.893 --> 01:13:22.663
MARISHA: We've got new flats coming.

01:13:22.663 --> 01:13:23.925
LAURA: Oh my gosh, yeah.

01:13:23.925 --> 01:13:26.163
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's a lot of new space for
art.

01:13:26.163 --> 01:13:29.921
MATT: Marisha.

01:13:29.921 --> 01:13:38.749
MARISHA: I think we've hinted at it. We just don't
know exactly when we're going to--

01:13:38.749 --> 01:13:43.104
MATT: "Hey, Marisha and Matt, congrats on your
engagement. Couldn't be happier for the two of

01:13:43.104 --> 01:13:47.629
"you. Here's a gift to commemorate the occasion.
Hope you enjoy it. All the best, your friendly

01:13:47.629 --> 01:13:48.939
"neighborhood Bonertown."

01:13:48.939 --> 01:13:50.990
ALL: Bonertown!

01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:55.654
MARISHA: Where has he been? I'm sure he's still
been around, I just feel like I haven't heard of

01:13:55.654 --> 01:13:57.343
Bonertown in a while.

01:13:57.343 --> 01:14:04.583
MATT: Right there should be fine. Oh. What!

01:14:04.583 --> 01:14:06.724
TALIESIN: This is going to be a two-person job,
isn't it?

01:14:06.724 --> 01:14:11.064
MATT: Marisha. Marisha.

01:14:11.064 --> 01:14:12.897
MARISHA: What?!

01:14:12.897 --> 01:14:16.910
TALIESIN: Oh no. Oh no.

01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:23.548
MATT: Turn that to the camera. That is
incredible.

01:14:23.548 --> 01:14:25.623
MARISHA: I already know where that's going.

01:14:25.623 --> 01:14:27.745
TALIESIN: The gold foil ink is nuts.

01:14:27.745 --> 01:14:37.545
LAURA: This is super limited printing, by the way.
132/175.

01:14:37.545 --> 01:14:49.666
MARISHA: Bonertown! Oh my god. You guys.

01:14:49.666 --> 01:14:52.854
LAURA: You made sure the tape on that side didn't
touch the picture, right?

01:14:52.854 --> 01:14:55.024
TALIESIN: No, I'm pretty sure.

01:14:55.024 --> 01:15:01.689
LAURA: There's tape on that side of the paper.
Yeah, let's just keep that away from it.

01:15:01.689 --> 01:15:06.194
MARISHA: Holy crap.

01:15:06.194 --> 01:15:08.281
LAURA: We're good.

01:15:08.281 --> 01:15:11.065
MARISHA: Is that everything?

01:15:11.065 --> 01:15:12.883
LIAM: I've got a couple things over here.

01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:20.986
TALIESIN: There's also this. I want to put this
somewhere super safe.

01:15:20.986 --> 01:15:34.745
MATT: "To Critical Role, from Kyle Jackson."
(laughs) Yes!

01:15:34.745 --> 01:15:36.286
LAURA: Stop hogging the joke!

01:15:36.286 --> 01:15:46.436
MATT: We have an updated one. "Mercer &amp;amp; Four Eyes
&amp;amp; Antlers &amp;amp; Taryon Darrington &amp;amp; Doty &amp;amp; Short Stuff

01:15:46.436 --> 01:15:53.596
"&amp;amp; Jumbo &amp;amp; Little Elf Boy &amp;amp; Little Elf Girl &amp;amp;
Friendly Bear." That is brilliant. Well, I'm

01:15:53.596 --> 01:15:55.250
wearing that on Thursday.

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:59.372
LAURA: That would be great, because you need to
get back at Sam for something.

01:15:59.372 --> 01:16:03.189
MATT: You know what? When I find time, I'm going
to get him back so hard.

01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:08.255
TALIESIN: Everyone, don't tweet at him. Don't
tweet at Sam, he doesn't have to know.

01:16:08.255 --> 01:16:12.916
MATT: This is a precursor. This is an accidental
venture. I have things planned.

01:16:12.916 --> 01:16:23.341
LIAM: I have a big page of limericks and some
gifts from Adam Schwartz, Tiamat_ZX, who I see

01:16:23.341 --> 01:16:29.266
active on Twitter. He's sent us a big page of
limericks. I'm going to read two, because there's

01:16:29.266 --> 01:16:35.612
a lot. Let's do both of Sam's. "Oh Scanlan he
could lie and deceive/But when alone his mother he

01:16:35.612 --> 01:16:41.687
"would grieve/He never showed his true colors/To
himself nor the others/But by the time they knew,

01:16:41.687 --> 01:16:48.200
"he'd made his leave." Too soon. "If you've heard
of Tary the daring/Then you know he is quite

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:53.098
"overbearing/He's naive and a fool/But he's skilled
with a tool/And his compassion is not a red

01:16:53.098 --> 01:16:54.117
"herring."

01:16:54.117 --> 01:16:55.628
ALL: Aww.

01:16:55.628 --> 01:17:04.360
LIAM: And he sent along two Dungeons and Dragons
Kre-O sets that I am commandeering for Sam and my

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:07.505
children. Thank you, thank you!

01:17:07.505 --> 01:17:11.212
MARISHA: Those are cool! I didn't know they made
Lego sets.

01:17:11.212 --> 01:17:14.302
LIAM: Well, it's not Lego, it's Kre-O.

01:17:14.302 --> 01:17:17.973
MARISHA: Those are pretty cool.

01:17:17.973 --> 01:17:24.922
TALIESIN: It's Lego-adjacent. Oh, it has a little
catapult, look at that. And tiny fish, which I

01:17:24.922 --> 01:17:26.801
don't understand but I'm excited for.

01:17:26.801 --> 01:17:28.862
(laughter)

01:17:28.862 --> 01:17:33.553
TALIESIN: Comes with catapult, goblet, and tiny
fish.

01:17:33.553 --> 01:17:36.047
MARISHA: Does it say 'tiny fish'?

01:17:36.047 --> 01:17:37.602
TALIESIN: No, it's just there.

01:17:37.602 --> 01:17:41.219
LIAM: You know, the Hobbit Lego, Gollum comes with
tiny fish.

01:17:41.219 --> 01:17:42.650
TALIESIN: Does this one come with tiny fish?

01:17:42.650 --> 01:17:44.383
LIAM: I don't know, but if it doesn't, I don't
want it.

01:17:44.383 --> 01:17:47.073
MARISHA: Okay, well, Sam's kids can have that
one.

01:17:47.073 --> 01:17:51.561
TALIESIN: This one comes with far more traditional
fare. No tiny fish.

01:17:51.561 --> 01:17:55.634
(laughter)

01:17:55.634 --> 01:17:57.204
MARISHA: I don't understand.

01:17:57.204 --> 01:18:00.913
TALIESIN: It comes with a treasure chest with keys
and gold coins and another catapult and a spider,

01:18:00.913 --> 01:18:02.044
but no tiny fish.

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:03.889
MARISHA: Okay, I think we have one more over
there.

01:18:03.889 --> 01:18:05.344
LIAM: I've got another one over here.

01:18:05.344 --> 01:18:06.722
TALIESIN: We're reaching the end, though.

01:18:06.722 --> 01:18:08.593
MARISHA: That one, and then I think that one's the
last one.

01:18:08.593 --> 01:18:09.974
MATT: This one here?

01:18:09.974 --> 01:18:13.495
LIAM: This sounds like dice. It's dice!

01:18:13.495 --> 01:18:15.509
LAURA: Give it all to me!

01:18:15.509 --> 01:18:20.750
LIAM: No. "To Vex and Vax", "To the wonderful cast
of Critical Role." You read the one to the twins

01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:22.555
and I'll read the one to the cast of Critical Role.

01:18:22.555 --> 01:18:23.819
LAURA: Okie-dokie.

01:18:23.819 --> 01:18:40.954
LIAM: Who's it from? Joshua Green. Does it say to
keep private? I don't know. Australia. Okay.

01:18:40.954 --> 01:18:47.190
TALIESIN: Lot of Australia. What's going on down
there?

01:18:47.190 --> 01:19:01.339
LAURA: Oh, this is literally-- this is to Vex and
Vax, from your aasimar childhood friend, Velandris

01:19:01.339 --> 01:19:18.446
Dawncollar. I remember him. That's awesome! Oh no.
"By the way, I need your help, Vex and Vax, and the

01:19:18.446 --> 01:19:23.218
"help of the rest of Vox Machina, and if you come
across any vampires, put a few down for me, and I

01:19:23.218 --> 01:19:30.337
"hate those mockeries of living." You got it,
Velandris Dawncollar.

01:19:30.337 --> 01:19:32.723
MATT: That's awesome.

01:19:32.723 --> 01:19:34.820
LAURA: That's so cool.

01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:42.158
LIAM: One of these-- there's four sets of dice in here.
I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Oh my

01:19:42.158 --> 01:19:50.978
gosh. What the hell is going on? The green swirl
dice. Green swirl dice? Yeah, that says Kiki.

01:19:50.978 --> 01:19:56.905
MARISHA: Oh yeah, these are cool.

01:19:56.905 --> 01:20:08.815
LIAM: This also says Kiki, so that goes to Marisha
as well. Laura gets the pink one. Oh, I get none

01:20:08.815 --> 01:20:12.170
of these. Pass this down to Laura and this to
Matt.

01:20:12.170 --> 01:20:17.305
LAURA: Ooh, these are pretty. I don't have any
blue this color.

01:20:17.305 --> 01:20:20.661
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Lord Fourth Wall.

01:20:20.661 --> 01:20:28.016
LAURA: Okay, these are actually really pretty blue
dice. I've never seen any like that.

01:20:28.016 --> 01:20:30.416
MATT: Mine's Creamsicle!

01:20:30.416 --> 01:20:32.806
LIAM: Yeah, but what color is your die?

01:20:32.806 --> 01:20:35.095
MARISHA: Mine's got a little brown in it.

01:20:35.095 --> 01:20:44.691
LAURA: I have to roll. 18!

01:20:44.691 --> 01:20:46.333
LIAM: Thank you, Joshua.

01:20:46.333 --> 01:20:48.835
MATT: Thank you so much!

01:20:48.835 --> 01:20:53.656
LAURA: I'm going to go put it with my dice.

01:20:53.656 --> 01:21:04.997
MATT: This here is from Scott Ismael. All right.

01:21:04.997 --> 01:21:07.453
MARISHA: Do you need assistance?

01:21:07.453 --> 01:21:10.898
MATT: Maybe. It's big things.

01:21:10.898 --> 01:21:15.085
MARISHA: Oh, jeez Louise, you guys.

01:21:15.085 --> 01:21:18.146
MATT: Oh my god.

01:21:18.146 --> 01:21:20.339
MARISHA: Get out of here, cardboard.

01:21:20.339 --> 01:21:22.267
MATT: Go, box. Go.

01:21:22.267 --> 01:21:32.039
MARISHA: No advertisement for Scotch! No! None for
you!

01:21:32.039 --> 01:21:34.826
(laughter)

01:21:34.826 --> 01:21:39.798
MATT: That's my girl. Not today, not tomorrow, not
ever!

01:21:39.798 --> 01:21:42.467
LIAM: Oh no, Scotch Tape just unfollowed us.

01:21:42.467 --> 01:21:51.057
MATT: Wow. Wow!

01:21:51.057 --> 01:22:00.729
ALL: Whoa!

01:22:00.729 --> 01:22:05.853
MATT: That's badass.

01:22:05.853 --> 01:22:10.337
TALIESIN: We just need him to build a full wall of
art, now.

01:22:10.337 --> 01:22:15.296
LAURA: We can make a gallery wall. I love gallery
walls.

01:22:15.296 --> 01:22:18.287
TALIESIN: All those Batman posters in the
hallway.

01:22:18.287 --> 01:22:25.608
MARISHA: Yeah! We have a bunch of movie posters in
the studio that we didn't make.

01:22:25.608 --> 01:22:29.640
TALIESIN: They magically vanish over the next 72
hours. That could happen.

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:38.068
MARISHA: We should have a gallery wall. You're
really good at it! Just put Laura on it.

01:22:38.068 --> 01:22:39.718
TALIESIN: All right, I'm down.

01:22:39.718 --> 01:22:44.038
LIAM: Laura is the physical reincarnation of Pinterest.

01:22:44.038 --> 01:22:53.519
MATT: Scott, this is amazing. And a perfect
example that there are many if not all crafts that

01:22:53.519 --> 01:22:59.654
are artistic in their own way. This is a brilliant
piece of woodworking, and I am honored. That is

01:22:59.654 --> 01:23:01.008
fantastic.

01:23:01.008 --> 01:23:02.003
MARISHA: He made that?

01:23:02.003 --> 01:23:03.236
MATT: He made that, yeah.

01:23:03.236 --> 01:23:06.028
LAURA: Does it say what kind of woods it is?

01:23:06.028 --> 01:23:14.759
MATT: I don't know. I will look back in the paper.
He does not say.

01:23:14.759 --> 01:23:16.791
LAURA: It's beautiful.

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:28.822
MATT: Don't neglect the brain. Thank you so much.
That's amazing.

01:23:28.822 --> 01:23:33.549
MARISHA: Well, that's Critmas in May, you guys.

01:23:33.549 --> 01:23:37.507
LAURA: Thanks for joining us for another
exciting episode of Talks Machina.

01:23:37.507 --> 01:23:39.330
(cheering)

01:23:39.330 --> 01:23:41.859
MARISHA: Yay, we did it!

01:23:41.859 --> 01:23:47.069
TALIESIN: And if you didn't see your package on
air, it's entirely possible that we did get it.

01:23:47.069 --> 01:23:53.090
Packages are not necessarily opened in the order
that they are received, nor are they received in

01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:56.620
the order that they were sent, nor were they
necessarily sent in a way that actually was

01:23:56.620 --> 01:24:02.546
received by us. We have them. We've possibly
opened them. We're pretty sure we have them. We

01:24:02.546 --> 01:24:06.116
don't open everything on air, so it's entirely
possible that we did get it, just because

01:24:06.116 --> 01:24:11.450
sometimes we see a package and get curious. Like a
small woodland creature.

01:24:11.450 --> 01:24:14.353
MATT: Or it says, "Open now or you will be cursed
for seven years."

01:24:14.353 --> 01:24:17.479
LIAM: Or the PO box office says, "Get your ass
over here, god damn it."

01:24:17.479 --> 01:24:19.120
TALIESIN: Yeah, they yell at us.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.519
LIAM: "What's wrong with you people?"

01:24:20.519 --> 01:24:24.107
MARISHA: And as always, we definitely implore you
guys to go check out the Critters' Guide to

01:24:24.107 --> 01:24:29.981
Critmas, if you want to be involved. Check that
out first, because there's a lot of great

01:24:29.981 --> 01:24:38.720
charities that we definitely love you guys to
check out and consider donating to, because giving

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:43.590
is fun and nice and makes you happy and feel
good.

01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:47.460
LIAM: And please give to the Planetary Society
before our planet implodes.

01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:51.490
TALIESIN: And 826LA, as always, and First Place
for Youth.

01:24:51.490 --> 01:24:54.881
MATT: First Book, Nature Conservatory.

01:24:54.881 --> 01:24:56.190
LAURA: My Friend's Place.

01:24:56.190 --> 01:25:04.016
MARISHA: What was Sam's? Oh, Pablove. Yeah,
there's a lot of great charities that we love and

01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:12.571
support. So yeah, don't feel like you have to buy
us stuff to still experience the joy of Critmas.

01:25:12.571 --> 01:25:16.532
MATT: Nope. In fact, few things bring us more
pride than the fact that you guys are giving back

01:25:16.532 --> 01:25:21.653
to the world and helping those who could use help
in many different facets in the name of nerdy

01:25:21.653 --> 01:25:23.121
roleplaying games.

01:25:23.121 --> 01:25:29.301
MARISHA: Yes, and we always read you guys' letters
where you talk about running games in schools and

01:25:29.301 --> 01:25:36.468
libraries and stuff that you guys are doing. We
read it all, we have a big notebook that we keep in--

01:25:36.468 --> 01:25:37.921
MATT: Multiple notebooks.

01:25:37.921 --> 01:25:40.232
TALIESIN: It used to be a notebook. It's not a
notebook anymore.

01:25:40.232 --> 01:25:47.272
MARISHA: We keep all of the fan letters, so know
that even if we don't say out loud, we keep and

01:25:47.272 --> 01:25:48.399
read all of them.

01:25:48.399 --> 01:25:50.960
TALIESIN: You all have excellent handwriting. It's
actually very impressive.

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:53.612
MATT: Yeah! It makes me very self-conscious about
my handwriting.

01:25:53.612 --> 01:25:56.711
TALIESIN: Very self-conscious about my handwriting
thanks to the fandom here.

01:25:56.711 --> 01:26:00.442
LIAM: You can keep sending pegasi to Laura Bailey,
though.

01:26:00.442 --> 01:26:03.441
LAURA: I will gladly accept.

01:26:03.441 --> 01:26:05.282
TALIESIN: Cue all the pegasi.

01:26:05.282 --> 01:26:07.402
MARISHA: And amazing crocheted goods.

01:26:07.402 --> 01:26:11.549
MATT: Thank you guys so much! You're amazing.

01:26:11.549 --> 01:26:18.318
MARISHA: This is amazing. What does Brian always
say? Oh, and as always, it's almost Thursday.

01:26:18.318 --> 01:26:21.168
MATT: Oh, I've got to prepare.

01:26:21.168 --> 01:26:41.005
