00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
MATT: Hello, and welcome to tonight's episode of
Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:10.616
actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons.
First and foremost, we are super excited that we

00:00:10.616 --> 00:00:14.344
actually have in the flesh here with us tonight
the wonderful Ashley Johnson!

00:00:14.344 --> 00:00:17.302
(cheering)

00:00:17.302 --> 00:00:18.709
ASHLEY: So glad.

00:00:18.709 --> 00:00:20.158
MATT: We missed you so much.

00:00:20.158 --> 00:00:22.509
ASHLEY: I missed you. Everybody.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.328
LIAM: You are not allowed to go.

00:00:24.328 --> 00:00:25.722
LAURA: Yeah, we're going to put her in a locked
room.

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:28.849
ASHLEY: I'd be okay with it.

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.492
LIAM: You'll eat your rice and play Dungeons and
Dragons.

00:00:30.492 --> 00:00:39.592
MATT: I'm glad you could join us here for this.
All right, so next up I believe, Laura, we have

00:00:39.592 --> 00:00:43.368
some new merch? Apparently, which I forgot about
until you showed me before the show.

00:00:43.368 --> 00:00:50.704
LAURA: I was just showing this off before the
stream. We have this amazing Matthew Mercer shirt.

00:00:50.704 --> 00:00:53.890
(cheering)

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.289
LAURA: It's kind of wrinkly because I was sitting
on it but...

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.702
MATT: I have a shirt.

00:01:01.702 --> 00:01:05.007
LAURA: So hey, that's in the store. That's in the
store right now.

00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:07.850
TRAVIS: It's got the logo on the back too.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.708
ASHLEY: You have a t-shirt.

00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:17.052
LAURA: And it's subtle, I like that anybody that
doesn't know what it is would just think it's a

00:01:17.052 --> 00:01:20.897
cool silhouette shirt. And then anybody that does
know what it is, it's like they're "in."

00:01:20.897 --> 00:01:23.491
TRAVIS: Is that the kind DM shirt, or is that the
evil sarcastic--

00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:26.820
LAURA: He's smirking evilly. It's an evil smirk.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.667
LIAM: You know the meme, when the dungeon master
smiles, it's too late.

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:36.700
MATT: Exactly. I really like it. I think it's
inspired reminiscent of another project I work on.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.655
And it makes me happy.

00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:41.296
LAURA: That's what inspired us to do it.

00:01:41.296 --> 00:01:44.102
LIAM: By the time he's smiling, you're already
getting choked out.

00:01:44.102 --> 00:01:54.634
MATT: Good times. Next up, just a reminder, we have
the Critical Role Vox Machina Origins comic book

00:01:54.634 --> 00:02:00.716
available on Comixology, on Dark Horse.
Apparently, where it is at now?

00:02:00.716 --> 00:02:06.635
LIAM: It's the second highest rated comic book on
Comixology at the moment.

00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:08.579
LAURA: Because Critters are awesome.

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.498
TALIESIN: Sitting at nine on the current
bestseller list.

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:13.721
LAURA: Of all time?

00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:14.878
SAM: Of all time.

00:02:14.878 --> 00:02:16.364
LIAM: On Comixology.

00:02:16.364 --> 00:02:19.979
MARISHA: We have the best fans.

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:21.480
TRAVIS: Yeah, pretty much.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.682
TALIESIN: It's a good book!

00:02:23.682 --> 00:02:25.446
MARISHA: It's so good.

00:02:25.446 --> 00:02:28.141
MATT: Next one is coming soon.

00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:30.016
LIAM: We saw it.

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:34.065
MATT: Excited for you guys.

00:02:34.065 --> 00:02:35.515
TALIESIN: It's got so much.

00:02:35.515 --> 00:02:42.803
MATT: We'll have information soon on when the next
comic comes out next month. Don't forget we have

00:02:42.803 --> 00:02:47.990
Talks Machina next Tuesday to discuss this
episode. Next Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific with our

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.961
fantastic host Brian Foster to discuss
Travis' third testicle.

00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:58.799
TALIESIN: Oh, they found out about that.

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.258
MATT: Yeah. It's on the list here. Also, don't
forget it's the last week of September so if you

00:03:04.258 --> 00:03:09.429
haven't had a chance yet and you always wanted to
go ahead and join the Geek and Sundry Twitch

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:14.598
community and subscribe, or any other Twitch
community that you've been waiting for, they're

00:03:14.598 --> 00:03:20.879
half off this month. So now's the time to jump in.
Laura and Travis, you're going to be at a

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.870
convention in Atlanta this weekend.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.016
LAURA: Why yes, we leave tomorrow morning
actually.

00:03:25.016 --> 00:03:29.159
TRAVIS: Bright and early, Anime Weekend Atlanta.
We're there Friday, Saturday, Sunday, come down,

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.533
see us and throw things in our face. That'd be
great.

00:03:32.533 --> 00:03:40.013
LAURA: And we're also going to be in Australia in
a couple weeks, or this November.

00:03:40.013 --> 00:03:47.626
SAM: Ashley, what's going on with you? Anything to
plug? Any other projects that you're working on?

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:49.609
LAURA: Are you working on any kind of shows or
anything?

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.947
MARISHA: Yeah, it seems like you've been so busy.

00:03:51.947 --> 00:04:01.196
ASHLEY: I just didn't want to come. I've just got
other things to do. Shop online. I'm just busy,

00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:06.700
guys. Looking at Cute Emergency on Twitter,
there's just so many more important things to do

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.200
than this. Just kidding, that's not true.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.652
MARISHA: You do retweet Cute Emergency quite a
lot.

00:04:11.652 --> 00:04:13.270
TALIESIN: You're how I found Cute Emergency.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.283
ASHLEY: Oh really? That makes me so glad. We love
aminals.

00:04:18.283 --> 00:04:28.838
MATT: All righty. Well then, without further ado.
Let's go ahead and dive into tonight's episode of

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:30.916
Critical Role.

00:04:30.916 --> 00:06:01.622
[dramatic music]

00:06:01.622 --> 00:06:04.139
LIAM: --me, daddy.

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:06.508
MATT: Little late on the draw there, bud.

00:06:06.508 --> 00:06:08.744
MARISHA: Like, unfashionably late.

00:06:08.744 --> 00:06:12.819
LIAM: What an accident that was. Oh no!

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:22.647
MATT: Welcome back. So last we left off, Vox
Machina had made their way through the innards of

00:06:22.647 --> 00:06:31.230
the undead risen primordial earth titan. On its
shoulders was held the long-abandoned until

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:36.434
recently city of Thar Amphala, from the
Shadowfell. A city that once held the armies of

00:06:36.434 --> 00:06:44.880
Vecna, the Undying King who has since risen once
more, and achieved godhood in recent days.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:51.025
You traversed to this titan, through its innards
up into the city of Thar Amphala; which you notice

00:06:51.025 --> 00:06:58.978
the outer wall currently manages to maintain an
arcane dome that holds at bay any of the outward

00:06:58.978 --> 00:07:05.492
assailing forces of the wyvern riders or Devo'ssa,
the brass dragon. Where the inside of it contains,

00:07:05.492 --> 00:07:13.691
in wait, a cloud of various gloomstalkers and a
skeletal dragon that just peruse the city in

00:07:13.691 --> 00:07:21.443
safety as you make your way through the streets in
search of the recently reassembled and standing

00:07:21.443 --> 00:07:23.801
tower of Entropis.

00:07:23.801 --> 00:07:33.744
Now upon seeking a sword that you were notified had
historical binds to the hatred of Vecna and hopefully

00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:43.375
his downfall, the Sword of Kas, you went seeking
this weapon, long ago discarded and bound within a

00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:51.565
buried catacomb within a pit of acid along with
various corpses left over from an ancient war. And

00:07:51.565 --> 00:07:58.551
in doing so, unfortunately notified Vecna of your
arrival. As Vex passed through into the ethereal

00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:06.732
plane, the ring that kept any sort of scrying at
bay was lost. And both Vax and Keyleth came to his

00:08:06.732 --> 00:08:14.243
attention. All of you managed to flee back to
Scanlan's mansion where the rest were in wait.

00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:19.177
However, with a notification fresh at hand, the
skeletal dragon swooped into the chamber where the

00:08:19.177 --> 00:08:27.637
mansion was set, on its back riding Lady
Delilah Briarwood and the re-risen Sylas

00:08:27.637 --> 00:08:29.103
Briarwood.

00:08:29.103 --> 00:08:38.471
The mansion was dispelled, you were exited from
the pocket plane and barely maneuvering, due to

00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:45.495
a very lucky roll, having your Plane Shift
dispelled you made your way into the Feywild as a

00:08:45.495 --> 00:08:52.116
Hail Mary. And through a dick-drawing, made
contact with the one archfey that you had

00:08:52.116 --> 00:09:02.426
encountered in your previous journeys, Artagan.
Upon being summoned, and your knowledge of the

00:09:02.426 --> 00:09:06.808
strange time-altering nature of exiting the
Feywild, you asked if it was within his power to

00:09:06.808 --> 00:09:15.133
ensure the condensing of the time passage when you
were to return. He agreed, under two conditions.

00:09:15.133 --> 00:09:20.193
One, when this was all said and done, you would
help him assemble a doorway in the Prime Material

00:09:20.193 --> 00:09:30.451
Plane, in which he could visit your space. And
two, upon realizing that Vax was of some undying

00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:42.496
or re-rising nature, wished to strangle him until
dead. You agreed, and shortly thereafter Vax

00:09:42.496 --> 00:09:48.812
expired into ashes and you all spent time awaiting
his return.

00:09:48.812 --> 00:09:53.383
We've left off with the return of Vax, but if
there's anything you wanted to do over that

00:09:53.383 --> 00:09:57.585
period of time before his arrival, now would be
the time to do it.

00:09:57.585 --> 00:09:59.390
SAM: Before his arrival?

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.670
TRAVIS: When he walks back.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:09.654
LAURA: So that we can do some spells that will be
in effect for a day. Potentially.

00:10:09.654 --> 00:10:11.255
SAM: But he takes a while to come back.

00:10:11.255 --> 00:10:12.785
MATT: It takes a little while, yeah.

00:10:12.785 --> 00:10:15.504
LAURA: So we should do some of our spells right
before we go to sleep.

00:10:15.504 --> 00:10:20.932
SAM: Yeah, for sure. Is that now?

00:10:20.932 --> 00:10:22.323
LAURA: I don't know!

00:10:22.323 --> 00:10:23.780
SAM: Is sleep now?

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.408
MATT: That's up to you.

00:10:25.408 --> 00:10:29.181
LAURA: We do need to do Heroes' Feast. I have one
chalice left.

00:10:29.181 --> 00:10:33.025
ASHLEY: But then Vax won't be in the--

00:10:33.025 --> 00:10:35.011
LAURA: Unless we leave him a plate.

00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:39.739
MATT: Well, the meal appears for a short time.

00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:41.912
LAURA: Then we need to do that right when he gets
back.

00:10:41.912 --> 00:10:44.327
MARISHA: Right before we sleep?

00:10:44.327 --> 00:10:46.521
LAURA: Yeah, hopefully he'll be back before--

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:48.319
SAM: We'll wait a few hours.

00:10:48.319 --> 00:10:51.534
LAURA: We'll wait a few hours to see if he shows
up and then we'll cast it to see because we need

00:10:51.534 --> 00:10:52.791
time to be able to do it.

00:10:52.791 --> 00:11:02.965
MATT: We'll say for the truncating of the wait
period that eight hours go by, 12 hours go by,

00:11:02.965 --> 00:11:07.749
it's hard to tell time in the Feywild, since it
doesn't have a day-night cycle, it's always on the

00:11:07.749 --> 00:11:14.524
cusp of sunset. And the longer you wait, and the
more the boredom sets in, the more the stress of

00:11:14.524 --> 00:11:21.156
the coming fray creeps into the back of your mind,
you find that it seems like far too much time has

00:11:21.156 --> 00:11:27.257
passed and you begin to worry, you begin to
twitch, you begin to do search parties around the

00:11:27.257 --> 00:11:33.176
surrounding forest, the possibility that he
returned and got lost. You don't know how much

00:11:33.176 --> 00:11:39.426
time has passed until you convene to desperately
ask if there was any possible sight, and at that

00:11:39.426 --> 00:11:45.584
point you hear the snapping of foliage beneath a
distant foot, and you all turn and by the nearby

00:11:45.584 --> 00:11:54.274
tree you see entering the pale, nude, long
dark-haired body of Vax returned in his revenant

00:11:54.274 --> 00:11:56.374
form for a second time.

00:11:56.374 --> 00:11:58.186
TRAVIS: Yep, that's him.

00:11:58.186 --> 00:12:03.349
LIAM: That was a thing. Does anyone have my
clothing?

00:12:03.349 --> 00:12:04.386
LAURA: Yes.

00:12:04.386 --> 00:12:10.961
TRAVIS: No, they took it and ran, it was part of
the penance. We fought bravely. It's buck naked

00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:12.150
from here on out.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.148
LIAM: That's going to make tomorrow a little
squirrely.

00:12:14.148 --> 00:12:20.826
MARISHA: Scanlan awkwardly put it in a weird druid
circle rock thing, it's over there.

00:12:20.826 --> 00:12:23.282
SAM: We were protecting it for you.

00:12:23.282 --> 00:12:26.195
MARISHA: He doesn't know how to do druid circles
really right.

00:12:26.195 --> 00:12:33.295
SAM: The goddess Ioun told me to protect it in a
circle reminiscent of the circle of my third eye.

00:12:33.295 --> 00:12:35.160
MARISHA: (whispering) I don't think he's telling
the truth.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.864
LIAM: Do you have all my shoes and glasses so I
may have them?

00:12:37.864 --> 00:12:40.330
SAM: As Ioun wills it, yes.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:45.671
LIAM: Okay, could you lead me and my penis towards
them now?

00:12:45.671 --> 00:12:48.221
SAM: Ioun be pleased, I will.

00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:54.617
LIAM: We're still standing here. It's getting
awkward.

00:12:54.617 --> 00:12:58.781
SAM: I'm a holy man. It's supposed to be awkward.

00:12:58.781 --> 00:13:01.449
LAURA: I'm going to start the Heroes' Feast, I'm
just going to get the chalice.

00:13:01.449 --> 00:13:05.360
TALIESIN: I'll help with that, that sounds like a
great use of time and not watching this.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:12.276
TRAVIS: I have a question. Should we ask the Sword
of Kas, since it's fought Vecna before, does it

00:13:12.276 --> 00:13:14.717
know of any weaknesses?

00:13:14.717 --> 00:13:17.955
LAURA: That's actually really smart. Wow, that's
really smart, Grog!

00:13:17.955 --> 00:13:19.543
ASHLEY: Oh good idea.

00:13:19.543 --> 00:13:22.634
TALIESIN: Don't think too hard about it.

00:13:22.634 --> 00:13:28.757
SAM: We can't hear him so you'll have to talk.
Hello?

00:13:28.757 --> 00:13:30.338
TRAVIS: Sorry.

00:13:30.338 --> 00:13:32.219
LAURA: That took a lot out of you.

00:13:32.219 --> 00:13:33.569
TRAVIS: I need to sit.

00:13:33.569 --> 00:13:38.401
TALIESIN: Grog, I have an idea. Why don't you ask
the sword if it has any idea of Vecna's

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:40.040
weaknesses?

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.579
TRAVIS: (gasp) That's a good idea Percy!

00:13:42.579 --> 00:13:43.767
TALIESIN: I'm so glad I had it.

00:13:43.767 --> 00:13:47.970
TRAVIS: Oh my god, yes. Wait, wait, if I pull it
out of the sheath to talk to it-- can I talk to it

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.292
through the sheath?

00:13:49.292 --> 00:13:50.789
MATT: You probably have to draw it.

00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:53.142
TRAVIS: I might have to draw it and then it's
going to need the (glugging).

00:13:53.142 --> 00:13:54.281
LAURA: Here.

00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:55.401
TRAVIS: You?!

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:56.646
LAURA: You can cut me.

00:13:56.646 --> 00:13:59.834
TRAVIS: Look, listen, I made a promise to your
brother, he was very adamant that I'm supposed to

00:13:59.834 --> 00:14:00.833
stick it--

00:14:00.833 --> 00:14:03.182
TALIESIN: I'll take it. It's my turn.

00:14:03.182 --> 00:14:05.792
SAM: Percy, what a tough thing for you to do.

00:14:05.792 --> 00:14:10.698
TRAVIS: Do you want just a hand slice or do you
want to up the ante and I stick it in your thigh?

00:14:10.698 --> 00:14:16.827
I do have to bathe it, it has to be quite a
coating.

00:14:16.827 --> 00:14:21.077
LAURA: Just do it, we'll heal him up.

00:14:21.077 --> 00:14:28.287
TRAVIS: Okay, cool, come on Percy. Buy the ticket,
baby! So can I unsheathe Kas?

00:14:28.287 --> 00:14:35.442
MATT: As you pull the blade out, there's a very
silent glass against textured metal sound. The

00:14:35.442 --> 00:14:44.228
blade is so dark that barely any of the light
seems to come across it. Where the blade is, up

00:14:44.228 --> 00:14:48.948
close, you can barely make out the outside of it,
but as soon as you draw it the voice goes,

00:14:48.948 --> 00:14:50.575
"Hungry."

00:14:50.575 --> 00:14:52.489
TALIESIN: All right, just on the count of three.

00:14:52.489 --> 00:14:59.103
TRAVIS: Do I get to pick where? Okay. I reach
around to the back of his knee and I pull along there.

00:14:59.103 --> 00:15:06.872
LAURA: Back of his knee?! Are you trying to take
him out of commission for future fights? That's

00:15:06.872 --> 00:15:10.327
really terrible.

00:15:10.327 --> 00:15:11.909
TALIESIN: I said yes.

00:15:11.909 --> 00:15:14.209
LAURA: I want to cast Cure Wounds at third level on
Percy.

00:15:14.209 --> 00:15:20.534
TRAVIS: Yeah, when you shave your legs the back of
your knee is the tricky part, right?

00:15:20.534 --> 00:15:23.354
TALIESIN: It's just so I can swim faster, that was
not for you to advertise.

00:15:23.354 --> 00:15:31.632
MATT: As you deal with the nearly hamstrung self
that is your right knee, the sword is coated well

00:15:31.632 --> 00:15:37.814
enough in Percival blood as it seeps into the
darkened blade, and the voice goes "Ah, yes."

00:15:37.814 --> 00:15:46.293
TRAVIS: Respectfully, Kas, I had a few questions
because I am on board to satisfy your maniacal

00:15:46.293 --> 00:15:53.907
desires to fuck up Vecna and all that he stands
for, right? Oh no, Kas?

00:15:53.907 --> 00:15:55.283
MATT: "Yes?"

00:15:55.283 --> 00:16:01.899
TRAVIS: Oh, thank god. Might need more blood soon.
Do you know of any weaknesses that Vecna has, or

00:16:01.899 --> 00:16:05.091
opportunities that we could explite?

00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:16.828
MATT: "He is more intelligent than most, but his
arrogance gets the best of him. He likes a show."

00:16:16.828 --> 00:16:25.714
TRAVIS: Apparently he's really smart, and is
arro-- aromatic.

00:16:25.714 --> 00:16:30.646
LAURA: He smells?

00:16:30.646 --> 00:16:32.539
MARISHA: Enigmatic?

00:16:32.539 --> 00:16:33.703
LIAM: Acrobatic.

00:16:33.703 --> 00:16:35.042
MARISHA: What does he mean?

00:16:35.042 --> 00:16:36.738
TRAVIS: He likes to put on a show, I think.

00:16:36.738 --> 00:16:38.464
LAURA: He likes to put on a show.

00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:39.446
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:16:39.446 --> 00:16:44.943
MATT: "He builds webs of plots, so many things
intertwined."

00:16:44.943 --> 00:16:49.338
TRAVIS: Doesn't make much sense, apparently he
builds whips out of plots.

00:16:49.338 --> 00:16:53.877
MATT: "Cut the threads, and the web can falter."

00:16:53.877 --> 00:17:00.162
TRAVIS: Oh right, he strings things together like
a web, you know, like a dog makes.

00:17:00.162 --> 00:17:02.290
LAURA: Oh that's smart, okay.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:10.718
MATT: "I can cut these threads, bring me to these
threads, bring me to him, I must cut him down,

00:17:10.718 --> 00:17:12.696
"now, now."

00:17:12.696 --> 00:17:16.422
TRAVIS: Yeah, oh god, he's really adamant about
cutting the webs.

00:17:16.422 --> 00:17:18.696
SAM: He's a sword, he cuts, that's his thing.

00:17:18.696 --> 00:17:20.131
MARISHA: Wait, cutting webs?

00:17:20.131 --> 00:17:25.969
TRAVIS: Yeah. I guess Vecna has spider abilities.
Pro-tip.

00:17:25.969 --> 00:17:29.685
LAURA: Okay. That's interesting, we didn't notice
that before.

00:17:29.685 --> 00:17:38.135
TRAVIS: Any physical weaknesses, or things that he
is vulnerable to that we should know?

00:17:38.135 --> 00:17:40.336
MATT: "Me."

00:17:40.336 --> 00:17:43.024
TRAVIS: Him, okay, cool, I think we've got
everything.

00:17:43.024 --> 00:17:46.940
MARISHA: He's vulnerable to-- oh, to--

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.463
TRAVIS: To him.

00:17:48.463 --> 00:17:50.195
MARISHA: Got it, I got what they got.

00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:54.621
TRAVIS: All right, next time I pull you out in the
light it will probably be to kill Vecna or someone

00:17:54.621 --> 00:17:55.816
that I don't like.

00:17:55.816 --> 00:17:59.954
MATT: As you put it away you hear a (sigh).

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:03.956
TALIESIN: You're actually going to pull that sword
out and it will have committed suicide.

00:18:03.956 --> 00:18:05.778
TRAVIS: How's your knee, is it okay?

00:18:05.778 --> 00:18:07.714
TALIESIN: It's feeling much better, thank you.

00:18:07.714 --> 00:18:14.653
LIAM: Should we maybe talk out our plan for the
moment?

00:18:14.653 --> 00:18:19.651
SAM: Sure. That sounds fun.

00:18:19.651 --> 00:18:25.578
LIAM: No it doesn't, but I do think we should
probably have at it. We've got the trammels,

00:18:25.578 --> 00:18:27.413
Grog's got them.

00:18:27.413 --> 00:18:30.379
LAURA: So Sylas is back.

00:18:30.379 --> 00:18:34.506
MARISHA: Along with Delilah. That's fun.

00:18:34.506 --> 00:18:37.715
LAURA: So my blessing, from Pelor.

00:18:37.715 --> 00:18:41.240
MARISHA: Hashtag blessed.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:49.933
LAURA: Hashtag blessed. Gives radiant damage to
anything evil that attacks me with a spell. That's

00:18:49.933 --> 00:18:57.016
pretty neat, huh? I have a feeling radiant damage
is going to be really important in this fight.

00:18:57.016 --> 00:19:01.655
MARISHA: I recently was able to attune to this
armor that I haven't been able to attune to for a

00:19:01.655 --> 00:19:04.757
long time and now I'm resistant to spells. So
that's good.

00:19:04.757 --> 00:19:05.943
LAURA: What?

00:19:05.943 --> 00:19:07.040
MARISHA: Yes.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.329
LAURA: You've just been wearing it and it's not
done anything?

00:19:09.329 --> 00:19:13.735
MARISHA: Kind of. Well I had to attune to my ring
and my antlers, and then I got the staff, so I let

00:19:13.735 --> 00:19:16.851
that go, but now I just wore it for long enough.

00:19:16.851 --> 00:19:20.276
LIAM: What are your three attuned right now?

00:19:20.276 --> 00:19:28.749
MARISHA: I have four, because I took a feat when I
leveled up. Yeah that's pretty dope.

00:19:28.749 --> 00:19:30.937
TRAVIS: I got a whole bunch of more hit points.

00:19:30.937 --> 00:19:32.499
SAM: What's a hit point?

00:19:32.499 --> 00:19:37.673
TRAVIS: It's like, I don't know. But I was
thinking, I have all three trammels, right, and I

00:19:37.673 --> 00:19:43.664
need to get real close to do anything to Vecna. Is
it stupid for me to have all of them?

00:19:43.664 --> 00:19:49.643
LIAM: Yes it is, we need to spread those out. We
need to decide who is doing what, at least what we

00:19:49.643 --> 00:19:52.043
think is going to happen. I think I should take
one of the trammels.

00:19:52.043 --> 00:19:53.789
LAURA: You're speedy, of course.

00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:59.217
MARISHA: And I think it's smart if Pike and I
dedicate a decent amount of our spell power to

00:19:59.217 --> 00:20:01.532
Freedom of Movement right before we go in.

00:20:01.532 --> 00:20:04.264
TALIESIN: That won't be necessary for me but for
the rest of you.

00:20:04.264 --> 00:20:06.230
TRAVIS: So we don't get paralyzed.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:10.723
SAM: If Vax has a trammel, and Grog has a trammel,
who has the third trammel?

00:20:10.723 --> 00:20:11.975
LIAM: One of these two.

00:20:11.975 --> 00:20:13.321
LAURA: I could do it.

00:20:13.321 --> 00:20:14.958
SAM: Someone who can fly. You can fly.

00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:17.737
LAURA: I have a broom after all. But Pike can fly
now too.

00:20:17.737 --> 00:20:20.024
SAM: Don't you have to be super strong to use
these trammels?

00:20:20.024 --> 00:20:22.418
MARISHA: Pike is super strong, she's a monstah!

00:20:22.418 --> 00:20:26.367
SAM: No, I'm fine with that. Can she fly?

00:20:26.367 --> 00:20:27.857
LAURA: She can fly.

00:20:27.857 --> 00:20:29.082
ASHLEY: I can now.

00:20:29.082 --> 00:20:30.211
SAM: How?

00:20:30.211 --> 00:20:34.846
ASHLEY: Well it's for ten minutes.

00:20:34.846 --> 00:20:36.438
SAM: That's all we'll need.

00:20:36.438 --> 00:20:39.220
LAURA: Ten minutes is a long time if it's right at
the beginning of the fight.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.172
SAM: But that's when we'll need to use the
trammels.

00:20:41.172 --> 00:20:43.265
MATT: Giant wings.

00:20:43.265 --> 00:20:47.274
LAURA: It's pretty tight. Oh my god you can
fucking fly!

00:20:47.274 --> 00:20:51.536
TRAVIS: I reach over to Pike, I spin her around,
are there any wings on the back?

00:20:51.536 --> 00:20:52.667
MATT: No.

00:20:52.667 --> 00:20:54.586
ASHLEY: I don't know where they are!

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:56.717
TRAVIS: I don't know how to break this to you.
They're not there yet.

00:20:56.717 --> 00:20:58.365
SAM: Sometimes they're on the ankles.

00:20:58.365 --> 00:21:00.928
TRAVIS: I turn her upside down, look at her feet.

00:21:00.928 --> 00:21:03.239
MATT: No wings.

00:21:03.239 --> 00:21:07.825
TRAVIS: I turn her back. Just keep wishing, they'll
grow in. Okay.

00:21:07.825 --> 00:21:09.501
ASHLEY: Oh, thank you, Grog.

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:15.837
LAURA: So do you think you're stronger, and you're
more proficient with actual melee weapons, right?

00:21:15.837 --> 00:21:18.719
Because I don't think I can shoot a trammel from
my bow.

00:21:18.719 --> 00:21:26.235
ASHLEY: I feel like I'd be pretty proficient
because it takes the strength to do it? I've got it.

00:21:26.235 --> 00:21:35.964
LAURA: Okay, let's have Pike hold the other one.
So Pike, you're the third. And we have to protect

00:21:35.964 --> 00:21:37.029
our cleric.

00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:39.656
SAM: What are all of us doing? I'm praying into a
book.

00:21:39.656 --> 00:21:41.107
LAURA: Fighting.

00:21:41.107 --> 00:21:42.145
SAM: Sure.

00:21:42.145 --> 00:21:48.464
MATT: To give you a mechanical idea, based on what
Ioun had notified you, the more damaged Vecna's

00:21:48.464 --> 00:21:53.025
avatar form is, the lower the DC to drive a
trammel into the body.

00:21:53.025 --> 00:21:56.780
LAURA: Oh, so we got to bloody him up and then--

00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.878
MATT: Possibly. Or roll really high early on, the
choice is up to you, that is the risk you have to take.

00:22:00.878 --> 00:22:04.771
LAURA: We don't know, if we try it with the
trammel and it doesn't work, it doesn't break the

00:22:04.771 --> 00:22:06.557
trammel, we just have to try again?

00:22:06.557 --> 00:22:10.925
MATT: You have two strong and one fragile trammel
in your midst.

00:22:10.925 --> 00:22:12.886
LAURA: Oh wait, who's holding the fragile one?

00:22:12.886 --> 00:22:13.840
LIAM: I am.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.249
LAURA: You're holding the fragile one.

00:22:15.249 --> 00:22:20.119
MARISHA: Okay, so save that one for when he's real
fucked up. Percy and I had a thought for Grog.

00:22:20.119 --> 00:22:22.445
TRAVIS: Thank god, because I don't have any
more.

00:22:22.445 --> 00:22:31.789
MARISHA: If you borrow Percy's Spider-Climbing
boots I can maybe make some pillars to add for

00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:39.272
cover for some of us more rangey people, but then
if I add pillars of different heights you can

00:22:39.272 --> 00:22:40.961
climb up them.

00:22:40.961 --> 00:22:42.490
TRAVIS: Do I have to attune to them?

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:43.752
TALIESIN: No.

00:22:43.752 --> 00:22:46.468
TRAVIS: Does my speed translate to going up things
as well?

00:22:46.468 --> 00:22:47.837
MATT: Oh yeah.

00:22:47.837 --> 00:22:50.310
TALIESIN: I don't know what boots you have right
now.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.067
TRAVIS: I have the Feral Leaping boots.

00:22:52.067 --> 00:22:56.440
TALIESIN: Would you rather just run like
Spider-Man? Up to you.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.609
TRAVIS: If he's more than 20 feet in the air, I'm
fucked.

00:22:58.609 --> 00:23:06.191
SAM: How can we get Grog to fly, though? Because
these pillars can't go all the way to the heavens,

00:23:06.191 --> 00:23:07.313
can they?

00:23:07.313 --> 00:23:11.982
MARISHA: I mean I could Shapechange into something
and give him a mount, he can ride me.

00:23:11.982 --> 00:23:14.287
LIAM: What about you Scanlan?

00:23:14.287 --> 00:23:16.757
LAURA: Can you still cast if you're a dragon or
something?

00:23:16.757 --> 00:23:23.363
MARISHA: I can cast in Beast Shape, Shapechange is
a spell, so if I'm a dragon, beholder, that's what

00:23:23.363 --> 00:23:24.886
you get.

00:23:24.886 --> 00:23:28.232
MATT: If the creature you transform into has
spells you can use those spells, but that's the

00:23:28.232 --> 00:23:29.569
only circumstance.

00:23:29.569 --> 00:23:31.659
LAURA: There's coffee all over it.

00:23:31.659 --> 00:23:34.063
TALIESIN: Yes there is, there's coffee on
everything there.

00:23:34.063 --> 00:23:39.968
MARISHA: Your dice tray dried nicely, though.

00:23:39.968 --> 00:23:43.002
TALIESIN: I think it actually has a little bit of
nice character. Look at that.

00:23:43.002 --> 00:23:46.441
MATT: A testament to Wyrmwood's craftsmanship.
Critrole!

00:23:46.441 --> 00:23:50.984
LAURA: This got put in the dishwasher, and the
leather got cooler after it got put in the

00:23:50.984 --> 00:23:52.104
dishwasher.

00:23:52.104 --> 00:23:53.427
MATT: Anyway you guys.

00:23:53.427 --> 00:24:01.654
SAM: No no, we're focused. I guess we could use
these pillars, but it seems like a waste of your

00:24:01.654 --> 00:24:05.550
spell to get him halfway up towards Vecna, if
Vecna is flying.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:12.034
LAURA: The thing is if you're flying you can get
knocked off, I've been there, and then it's super

00:24:12.034 --> 00:24:15.018
bad, so actually the pillars are really wonderful
in that regard.

00:24:15.018 --> 00:24:17.201
SAM: If he's straight above us.

00:24:17.201 --> 00:24:20.596
MARISHA: Well I can do six of them, I can do a lot
of pillars.

00:24:20.596 --> 00:24:26.098
LAURA: He could be off of the tower, yes, and then
it's all ranged attacks, that's what we have.

00:24:26.098 --> 00:24:30.297
SAM: All right, no plan.

00:24:30.297 --> 00:24:35.553
TALIESIN: The plans are easy, the magic users are
going to be attacking Vecna with all they're worth.

00:24:35.553 --> 00:24:38.782
LAURA: Hopefully we'll be able to take out the
Briarwoods before the fight.

00:24:38.782 --> 00:24:44.462
MARISHA: I can cause up to six pillars, each
pillar is a cylinder five feet wide and up to 30

00:24:44.462 --> 00:24:47.637
feet high, and can do six of them.

00:24:47.637 --> 00:24:49.393
SAM: Can you do them on top of each other?

00:24:49.393 --> 00:24:53.099
MARISHA: Well, he wasn't that much more than 30
feet last time.

00:24:53.099 --> 00:24:55.854
LAURA: He was above us, but if he goes off of the
tower.

00:24:55.854 --> 00:24:57.996
LIAM: I was about 50 or 60 feet in the air and I
was above him.

00:24:57.996 --> 00:25:03.035
MARISHA: If I get Grog 30 feet up you still have
your throwing axe, he's still reachable another 30

00:25:03.035 --> 00:25:05.299
feet for you right? Theoretically.

00:25:05.299 --> 00:25:08.847
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I'm not using the axe or the
hammer, I'm using the sword.

00:25:08.847 --> 00:25:12.536
MATT: You can still attach the Chain of
Returning to the Sword of Kas.

00:25:12.536 --> 00:25:16.359
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it's only one attack per
action.

00:25:16.359 --> 00:25:17.461
MATT: Correct.

00:25:17.461 --> 00:25:18.870
TRAVIS: Instead of three.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:21.474
MARISHA: But it's something, if he's out of
range.

00:25:21.474 --> 00:25:26.376
TALIESIN: I'll have enough bullets that I may not
be able to hurt him, but I can make him drop.

00:25:26.376 --> 00:25:27.960
TRAVIS: What are you planning on doing?

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:36.159
SAM: My plan is to not run away, because we're
going to die fighting or we're going to save the

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:41.886
world, right? So I definitely won't be running
away. Definitely.

00:25:41.886 --> 00:25:43.380
LAURA: Scanlan.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.467
SAM: I may run away.

00:25:45.467 --> 00:25:51.425
LIAM: If you do, and he slaughters everybody, and
subjugates the entire world--

00:25:51.425 --> 00:25:55.076
SAM: I'll tell your story, and I'll tell it very
well.

00:25:55.076 --> 00:25:59.877
LIAM: As the Crumbly, the little guy to Jabba the
Hutt, for Vecna.

00:25:59.877 --> 00:26:05.741
LAURA: Scanlan. If you promise you won't run away,
I'll put this fucking hat back on.

00:26:05.741 --> 00:26:07.381
SAM: (gasps)

00:26:07.381 --> 00:26:09.621
LAURA: And I bring out the stupid pointy hat that
he gave me.

00:26:09.621 --> 00:26:12.289
SAM: Wow! That's a deal.

00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:16.859
TRAVIS: Here's the thing, last time we fought
Vecna, he went higher than 30 feet, he was up

00:26:16.859 --> 00:26:19.182
where Vax was before he fell.

00:26:19.182 --> 00:26:22.347
LIAM: I was above him though, and I was 50 or 60
up, he wasn't that high.

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:23.641
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:26:23.641 --> 00:26:29.585
TALIESIN: Up to you, that is an option that is up
to you. But let me know, because either way I'm

00:26:29.585 --> 00:26:31.761
going to either keep my boots or not keep my
boots.

00:26:31.761 --> 00:26:39.319
MARISHA: Do we remember how high the tower orby
situation was, did we get a number for it?

00:26:39.319 --> 00:26:44.047
MATT: The tower of Entropis? The very height of it
you didn't gauge entirely as you flew up, but even

00:26:44.047 --> 00:26:46.013
at a bit of distance, it was hundreds of feet
high.

00:26:46.013 --> 00:26:48.941
MARISHA: No, I mean, there was the dome above
that.

00:26:48.941 --> 00:26:56.125
MATT: Oh, the dome above that is probably about
another 100 or 200 feet above that. It's a big

00:26:56.125 --> 00:26:58.442
dome and it encompasses the entire city of
Entropis.

00:26:58.442 --> 00:27:03.973
TALIESIN: And we don't know who's casting that, we
don't know where that's coming from.

00:27:03.973 --> 00:27:05.648
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

00:27:05.648 --> 00:27:06.898
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:27:06.898 --> 00:27:10.556
MARISHA: I mean there's that gemstone thing that
he's using.

00:27:10.556 --> 00:27:11.881
LAURA: Natural 20!

00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:13.547
TALIESIN: No, but a 21 will do it.

00:27:13.547 --> 00:27:19.587
MATT: You recall, the Thar Amphala that is
currently embedded in the titan is not the entire

00:27:19.587 --> 00:27:24.604
city, it's only the inner circle of the city. You
encountered the inner circle of the city, and you

00:27:24.604 --> 00:27:30.131
saw a little bit of the edges, there's a wall that
is built on the inside of Thar Amphala. This was

00:27:30.131 --> 00:27:34.088
the same wall that contained the threshold crests
that caused it to transport from the Shadowfell to

00:27:34.088 --> 00:27:41.378
the Prime Material Plane. You looked at the energy
of this field, you've seen it pulse from the wall

00:27:41.378 --> 00:27:43.154
upward, like (pulse sounds).

00:27:43.154 --> 00:27:47.565
TALIESIN: We could break through. We could break
the wall.

00:27:47.565 --> 00:27:54.724
MARISHA: That's right! And then we could bring in
the forces.

00:27:54.724 --> 00:27:59.122
LAURA: And then J'mon Sa Ord will be able to help
us. Help us!

00:27:59.122 --> 00:28:01.981
MARISHA: Help us! Help us J'mon, help us!

00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:12.300
LAURA: That's good, we go over the walls first.
Here's the good thing about us bamfing to the

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:18.414
Feywild, right. They think we left, and if we all
actually stick together and don't fuck up with

00:28:18.414 --> 00:28:23.209
this fucking ring next time, they won't know that
we're there again. Because last time they had an

00:28:23.209 --> 00:28:27.024
idea because you guys, you know, almost died as we
were going in.

00:28:27.024 --> 00:28:28.673
MARISHA: Yeah I know, I remember.

00:28:28.673 --> 00:28:34.015
SAM: I have an idea about Grog flying that just
occurred to me. Trinket's big.

00:28:34.015 --> 00:28:35.940
LAURA: He is.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:42.913
SAM: Trinket could be Polymorphed into something
else big, like a flying eagle of some sort. And

00:28:42.913 --> 00:28:45.242
actually be useful.

00:28:45.242 --> 00:28:49.603
LAURA: How dare you. If they Dispel that won't he
just turn into Trinket and he'll fall?

00:28:49.603 --> 00:28:54.733
SAM: Yes, but with big risk comes big reward.

00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:57.499
LAURA: Trinket?

00:28:57.499 --> 00:29:03.783
MATT: Trinket over there is on the side, arms
playing pillow to the muzzle.

00:29:03.783 --> 00:29:19.588
LAURA: Okay. Bud? If you fuck this up, Scanlan! Oh,
I don't have any more spells, do I, to do it? He

00:29:19.588 --> 00:29:24.214
can understand me, I just can't understand him,
with my Speak With Animals. Shit.

00:29:24.214 --> 00:29:26.122
ASHLEY: Tell him to just shake his head.

00:29:26.122 --> 00:29:33.041
LAURA: Okay. Oh, it's 1st-level, I have a 1st-level
left. Okay, here's the thing, Scanlan wants to

00:29:33.041 --> 00:29:35.512
turn you into something that flies.

00:29:35.512 --> 00:29:39.323
MATT: You hear this slight squeak of a bear fart
in his direction.

00:29:39.323 --> 00:29:51.008
LAURA: Good job. Yeah. Would you be willing to--
are you okay with that, for the actual big-- I

00:29:51.008 --> 00:29:53.273
mean, you could be up close and personal with
fucking Vecna.

00:29:53.273 --> 00:30:00.044
MATT: Trinket walks up to you now, and his fully
grown form is a good foot and a half taller than

00:30:00.044 --> 00:30:05.723
you at the shoulders. He comes up and gets really
close and (bear breathing), and butts his head

00:30:05.723 --> 00:30:11.231
against you, and then licks the side of your
face.

00:30:11.231 --> 00:30:13.217
LAURA: Yeah?

00:30:13.217 --> 00:30:14.680
MATT: And sits back.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:22.942
LAURA: Aw. You can do it. Don't hurt him! Okay.

00:30:22.942 --> 00:30:24.467
SAM: It's a plan B.

00:30:24.467 --> 00:30:28.443
LIAM: Do you have anything gnarlier than-- I mean,
I'm a little invested too, I've spent a lot of

00:30:28.443 --> 00:30:32.789
years with this bear-- like, anything gnarlier
than-- an eagle's cool, but like anything with

00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:35.414
spikes, or rhino armor, or anything like that?

00:30:35.414 --> 00:30:36.837
TALIESIN: Like a flying rhino?

00:30:36.837 --> 00:30:38.239
LIAM: Can you do a flying rhino?

00:30:38.239 --> 00:30:40.253
SAM: What flying things have we seen that are
scary?

00:30:40.253 --> 00:30:41.723
LAURA: A wyvern.

00:30:41.723 --> 00:30:43.349
MARISHA: Polymorph, I don't know--

00:30:43.349 --> 00:30:48.517
SAM: I can't Polymorph; I could &lt;i&gt;True&lt;/i&gt; Polymorph
Trinket and permanently make him a wyvern.

00:30:48.517 --> 00:30:51.475
MATT: It can still be dispelled if it is permanent
on True Polymorph, by the way.

00:30:51.475 --> 00:30:54.857
SAM: It can be dispelled, just at an action?

00:30:54.857 --> 00:30:59.943
MATT: Yeah. That was an errata to the spell that
I've discovered as the internet made very keenly

00:30:59.943 --> 00:31:01.356
aware to me.

00:31:01.356 --> 00:31:02.878
SAM: Even if it becomes permanent?

00:31:02.878 --> 00:31:04.286
MATT: Correct.

00:31:04.286 --> 00:31:05.147
SAM: Wow.

00:31:05.147 --> 00:31:07.113
MARISHA: Then what the fuck does "permanent"
mean?

00:31:07.113 --> 00:31:14.968
SAM: A simple, level three Dispel Magic can get
rid of a 9th-level permanent Polymorph?

00:31:14.968 --> 00:31:18.706
MATT: Well, you have to know that the creature has
been polymorphed into that form. And even then,

00:31:18.706 --> 00:31:20.924
it's a 9th-level spell that you're trying to
dispel, which is not--

00:31:20.924 --> 00:31:24.206
MARISHA: So they have to at least cast it at
9th-level, in order to dispel it.

00:31:24.206 --> 00:31:26.645
MATT: To be instantaneous. Or they have to roll
against it.

00:31:26.645 --> 00:31:30.743
SAM: I'm not going to waste my True Polymorph on
that. Just standard Polymorph.

00:31:30.743 --> 00:31:34.965
LIAM: Does that mean you could permanently do it
to him, and then &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; cast Dispel Magic on him

00:31:34.965 --> 00:31:36.248
later to undo it?

00:31:36.248 --> 00:31:37.509
MATT: Yeah. You could do that.

00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:39.536
LAURA: Yeah. Oh, so you could use that tonight.

00:31:39.536 --> 00:31:41.129
LIAM: Tonight. To lock him in.

00:31:41.129 --> 00:31:43.894
SAM: Yeah. But it could still be dispelled.

00:31:43.894 --> 00:31:51.280
TALIESIN: He would have to burn a dispel at
9th-level.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.185
MARISHA: Wait, are you talking about Polymorph or
True Polymorph right now?

00:31:53.185 --> 00:31:56.105
SAM: I was just talking about Polymorph.

00:31:56.105 --> 00:32:00.753
LAURA: I think Polymorph tomorrow and then use
your 9th-level spell for something major.

00:32:00.753 --> 00:32:02.980
LIAM: But if it's permanent, why not do it
tonight?

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.674
LAURA: Because he can use a 9th-level spell
&lt;i&gt;tonight&lt;/i&gt; for something.

00:32:05.674 --> 00:32:08.726
MARISHA: Because Polymorph only lasts for, like,
an hour. What else you have?

00:32:08.726 --> 00:32:11.148
LAURA: As we're doing this, we're making the
feast, because we're about to get ready to go to

00:32:11.148 --> 00:32:12.250
bed, right?

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:14.175
MARISHA: Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom food.

00:32:14.175 --> 00:32:16.340
LAURA: Yeah, so we make our feast before we go to
sleep.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:20.261
MATT: All right. Polymorph is a concentration
spell, so keep that in mind.

00:32:20.261 --> 00:32:21.253
SAM: Yes.

00:32:21.253 --> 00:32:22.770
LIAM and TALIESIN: Oh.

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:23.942
MATT: Yes.

00:32:23.942 --> 00:32:25.128
LAURA: Oh, shit.

00:32:25.128 --> 00:32:26.382
SAM: Yeah.

00:32:26.382 --> 00:32:28.305
MATT: You wouldn't have to concentrate with True
Polymorph.

00:32:28.305 --> 00:32:29.386
SAM: True.

00:32:29.386 --> 00:32:32.440
MATT: But. Those are just the specifications.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.254
SAM: What's more important?

00:32:34.254 --> 00:32:36.893
LIAM: Could he be a baby, like a young ancient
dragon?

00:32:36.893 --> 00:32:39.025
SAM: Yeah.

00:32:39.025 --> 00:32:41.458
LAURA: You can turn Trinket into a dragon?

00:32:41.458 --> 00:32:45.371
SAM: Well, let's see here. He has a challenge
rating, doesn't he, this Trinket.

00:32:45.371 --> 00:32:46.461
LAURA: Yeah.

00:32:46.461 --> 00:32:50.442
MATT: I will put Trinket at about a challenge
rating of six, I'd say. Because he's not a full,

00:32:50.442 --> 00:32:53.723
powerful creature; he's a complement to you.

00:32:53.723 --> 00:32:54.727
LAURA: Right.

00:32:54.727 --> 00:32:57.056
MATT: I'd put him at a six, maybe. High end.

00:32:57.056 --> 00:33:00.996
SAM: So monsters of a six. I don't even know; I'll
look at the list.

00:33:00.996 --> 00:33:05.204
MATT: Okay. Think about it. Regardless. Who's
casting? You said you were casting Heroes' Feast?

00:33:05.204 --> 00:33:13.677
All right, as you set up the table, you summon
forth the meal that is infused with divine energy.

00:33:13.677 --> 00:33:21.066
You all begin to eat in solemn quiet, occasionally
discussing plans and tactics. The delicious--

00:33:21.066 --> 00:33:22.674
LAURA: Artagan can join us.

00:33:22.674 --> 00:33:26.401
MATT: Oh, he does. Don't worry. As soon as you
guys begin to eat, at the far end of the table you

00:33:26.401 --> 00:33:30.495
see the orange mane erupt from the side of table
as he takes a seat. "Oh, wondrous. I appreciate

00:33:30.495 --> 00:33:31.901
"this, thank you."

00:33:31.901 --> 00:33:34.391
LIAM: So did that live up to your expectations,
then?

00:33:34.391 --> 00:33:41.202
MATT: "Hello. It was all right."

00:33:41.202 --> 00:33:44.510
LIAM: New hobby, or--?

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:52.831
MATT: "I don't know. Have to try when they're not
willing. That's a joke; that's a joke."

00:33:52.831 --> 00:33:56.246
LAURA: Okay. Hey, Artagan, can you look at this
wand?

00:33:56.246 --> 00:33:58.201
MATT: "Which wand?"

00:33:58.201 --> 00:33:59.734
LAURA: This wand in my hand.

00:33:59.734 --> 00:34:02.015
MATT: Which wand are you handing him?

00:34:02.015 --> 00:34:05.603
LAURA: It was a wooden wand from one of Vecna's
people that I hijacked.

00:34:05.603 --> 00:34:11.182
MATT: It's a war wand. It's a plus one wand. For
anyone who's casting a spell through it, it's a

00:34:11.182 --> 00:34:13.358
plus one modifier to DC.

00:34:13.358 --> 00:34:15.266
LAURA: Oh, do you have to attune?

00:34:15.266 --> 00:34:17.508
MATT: Generally you have to attune to these,
yeah.

00:34:17.508 --> 00:34:21.332
LAURA: Okay. Great. All right. Thanks.

00:34:21.332 --> 00:34:25.245
TALIESIN: There's nothing special about these
symbols that they wear around their necks, are

00:34:25.245 --> 00:34:31.322
they? Just since it is in your interest to keep us
alive long enough to build you a portal.

00:34:31.322 --> 00:34:35.644
MATT: "Well, it doesn't require or contain any
magic, if that's what you're asking."

00:34:35.644 --> 00:34:36.584
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:34:36.584 --> 00:34:37.917
TRAVIS: It's just jewelry.

00:34:37.917 --> 00:34:43.150
MATT: "Well, it's a focus. It's a divine focus for
those who wish to utilize it to draw energy from

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:48.966
"their deity of choice, and/or just a token of
brotherhood."

00:34:48.966 --> 00:34:50.870
TRAVIS: Boring.

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:54.046
MATT: "Delicious meal, by the way."

00:34:54.046 --> 00:34:55.169
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:34:55.169 --> 00:34:56.284
MATT: "Is it yours?"

00:34:56.284 --> 00:34:57.176
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:34:57.176 --> 00:34:58.349
MATT: "Thank you."

00:34:58.349 --> 00:34:59.278
TRAVIS: So good.

00:34:59.278 --> 00:35:00.605
ASHLEY: Oh, you're so welcome.

00:35:00.605 --> 00:35:02.411
MATT: "All right. When do you intend to go back?"

00:35:02.411 --> 00:35:04.509
LAURA: As soon as we go to sleep and wake up.

00:35:04.509 --> 00:35:09.293
MATT: "Well then. Sleep it is." And he gestures
over, his hand behind you, and as you look back you can

00:35:09.293 --> 00:35:14.977
see there's a series of beds that have all
constructed out of the nearby moss and vines. They

00:35:14.977 --> 00:35:20.495
grow and lift up out of the natural floor of the
Feywild. As the beds form, you watch as the

00:35:20.495 --> 00:35:26.766
tethered vines and roots to the ground begin to
form these dome-like tents over each specific bed.

00:35:26.766 --> 00:35:28.478
LAURA: Oh, good. Privacy.

00:35:28.478 --> 00:35:31.620
MARISHA: Are you doing anything?

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:32.938
SAM: Oh, yeah.

00:35:32.938 --> 00:35:34.586
MARISHA: With your thing, before we go to sleep?

00:35:34.586 --> 00:35:43.008
SAM: I mean, if I True Polymorph him, Trinket, I
could do a wyvern, or a young white dragon, or--

00:35:43.008 --> 00:35:45.181
Is J'mon a brass or bronze?

00:35:45.181 --> 00:35:46.529
TRAVIS and MATT: Brass.

00:35:46.529 --> 00:35:53.432
SAM: I could do a young brass, young white dragon,
or a wyvern. Or I could have another Scanlan.

00:35:53.432 --> 00:35:58.146
LAURA: Oh. I vote Scanlan.

00:35:58.146 --> 00:36:02.744
SAM: Scanlan Two can cast Polymorph.

00:36:02.744 --> 00:36:10.078
LAURA: And he'll just hang around with us? Second
Scanlan hangs around with us until what?

00:36:10.078 --> 00:36:13.399
LIAM: I mean, that is flat-out amazing.

00:36:13.399 --> 00:36:15.567
SAM: We'll see. (laughs) Or not.

00:36:15.567 --> 00:36:17.590
TALIESIN: The world is ready for two Scanlans.

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:22.570
SAM: I'm pretty sure it will be apparent that he
is not a real person.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:25.104
ASHLEY: How will he know which is which?

00:36:25.104 --> 00:36:29.769
SAM: That's true. Well, you'll know, because, come
on. This charm can't be replicated.

00:36:29.769 --> 00:36:31.414
LIAM: Nah, we need two hats or something.

00:36:31.414 --> 00:36:36.846
MARISHA: Hang on, I will say, a second Scanlan
will immediately clue in Vecna that there's some

00:36:36.846 --> 00:36:38.966
trickery magic going on.

00:36:38.966 --> 00:36:40.091
SAM: Sure.

00:36:40.091 --> 00:36:44.299
MARISHA: Is there a way that second Scanlan can
be, like, definitely hidden? So he can just be

00:36:44.299 --> 00:36:47.590
(snaps) support Scanlan? Counterspell Scanlan?

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:52.426
TALIESIN: If we give him the Hat of
Disguise, then there's just a magical field being

00:36:52.426 --> 00:36:53.712
about a magical--

00:36:53.712 --> 00:36:55.648
LIAM: Can the Meat Man join us?

00:36:55.648 --> 00:36:56.958
LAURA: Yeah, let's do that.

00:36:56.958 --> 00:36:58.118
SAM: Yeah. He could be the Meat Man.

00:36:58.118 --> 00:36:59.346
TRAVIS: No truesight? No seeing through this?

00:36:59.346 --> 00:37:01.722
LAURA: I'm sure they have truesight. Vecna's a
god. Of course he can see everything.

00:37:01.722 --> 00:37:04.233
SAM: But I think you have to &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; truesight. It
doesn't just happen.

00:37:04.233 --> 00:37:09.125
MATT: As a god of secrets, probably see through an
illusion.

00:37:09.125 --> 00:37:13.682
TRAVIS: No, no, on. We're going to pull it over on
Vecna. We're fine. This is a great plan.

00:37:13.682 --> 00:37:17.213
MATT: Just throwing it out there, based on your
experience, even the creatures &lt;i&gt;around&lt;/i&gt; the tower

00:37:17.213 --> 00:37:18.670
have truesight.

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:22.591
LAURA: Oh, shit. So he's going to know even, like,
he's going to know Trinket's not a fucking-- Is

00:37:22.591 --> 00:37:28.588
that seen on truesight? Oh, no, he's &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt;
that animal. So he'd have to know.

00:37:28.588 --> 00:37:33.403
TRAVIS: Do it, man. Do it. We're overthinking it.

00:37:33.403 --> 00:37:37.824
MARISHA: Because he can also maybe just cast
support stuff for us, right?

00:37:37.947 --> 00:37:39.595
LAURA: Yeah, exactly. Fuck it. Do it!

00:37:39.595 --> 00:37:42.280
LIAM: Can Vecna just dispel the second Scanlan
away?

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.318
SAM: He can can certainly try.

00:37:44.318 --> 00:37:46.779
TALIESIN: And he will have to burn some stuff.

00:37:46.779 --> 00:37:52.062
MARISHA: And the only other thing would be, like,
a second Pike to do all of the Freedom of Movement

00:37:52.062 --> 00:37:53.781
stuff, and things like that--

00:37:53.781 --> 00:37:55.410
SAM: That's nice.

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:58.664
MARISHA: Those Counterspells, man--

00:37:58.664 --> 00:38:02.247
MATT: Just keep in mind, Counterspell can't be
done unless they're on the field to see the spell

00:38:02.247 --> 00:38:06.730
being cast and within 60 feet. So second Scanlan
would have to be in the fray.

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:09.830
MARISHA: Can second Scanlan be invisible second
Scanlan?

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:11.448
SAM: He can for a while, yeah.

00:38:11.448 --> 00:38:14.888
MATT: You can. And things that see through
invisibility, like a god of secrets, would

00:38:14.888 --> 00:38:16.008
probably see through it.

00:38:16.008 --> 00:38:18.505
LIAM: You can never have enough Scanlan. There's
always room for Scanlan.

00:38:18.505 --> 00:38:21.399
SAM: These are good catch phrases, for sure.

00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:23.839
TALIESIN: Depending on whether or not you have the
mount, let me know if you want to trade boots or

00:38:23.839 --> 00:38:25.510
not, since these are non-attunable.

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:33.668
MARISHA: Okay, hang on, if someone has to roll to
see if second Scanlan is dispelled, do &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; have

00:38:33.668 --> 00:38:34.799
to roll?

00:38:34.799 --> 00:38:35.871
MATT: No.

00:38:35.871 --> 00:38:37.314
MARISHA: Second Scanlan has to roll?

00:38:37.314 --> 00:38:38.590
MATT: Vecna would have to roll.

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:39.786
MARISHA: Vecna has to roll.

00:38:39.786 --> 00:38:40.913
TALIESIN: And Vecna will win.

00:38:40.913 --> 00:38:42.455
LIAM: You know how Vecna rolls.

00:38:42.455 --> 00:38:44.952
TRAVIS: And we're definitely doing the pillars?

00:38:44.952 --> 00:38:47.707
MARISHA: I can throw up pillars.

00:38:47.707 --> 00:38:49.335
TRAVIS: No, I mean, are we, or are we not?

00:38:49.335 --> 00:38:50.121
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:38:50.121 --> 00:38:53.222
LAURA: We are doing the pillars, if he's not doing
something on Trinket.

00:38:53.222 --> 00:38:59.310
MARISHA: I think the pillars could be good for
cover and other things. Because I'm assuming we're--

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:00.771
TRAVIS: Okay, cool. We're doing the pillars.

00:39:00.771 --> 00:39:03.505
LAURA: Scanlan, do something so that we can
sleep.

00:39:03.505 --> 00:39:14.173
SAM: All right. I need the strength of two mes to
win this fight. So I'm going to drop to my knees,

00:39:14.173 --> 00:39:24.650
and Wish to the gods that there was somehow more
of me, that I could somehow be in two places at

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:37.025
the same time. I wish for more me. Me-more. Me,
but more. Más Scanlan.

00:39:37.025 --> 00:39:46.390
MATT: All right. As the words leave your lips, you
can see Artagan himself, as he finishes the meal,

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:54.075
leans back. "Hmm." Like, seemingly taken aback by
the power of these words you've spoken, as you

00:39:54.075 --> 00:40:02.482
watch as hints of nearby slowly melting snowfall
that seem to have gathered elements at the base of

00:40:02.482 --> 00:40:08.806
the trees nearby begin to slowly congeal into a
form. You do realize that this is going to take

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:11.020
you 12 hours to complete, right?

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:12.224
SAM: Oh, yeah.

00:40:12.224 --> 00:40:13.410
LAURA: So you should've started that earlier.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:14.481
SAM: Shit. (laughs)

00:40:14.481 --> 00:40:15.525
MATT: Yeah.

00:40:15.525 --> 00:40:17.092
MARISHA: So can we decide that earlier?

00:40:17.092 --> 00:40:18.326
MATT and TRAVIS: No.

00:40:18.326 --> 00:40:19.413
MARISHA: That's cool.

00:40:19.413 --> 00:40:21.717
SAM: You guys can sleep, then I'll sleep, you wait
for me.

00:40:21.717 --> 00:40:26.586
MATT: You'll be arriving a little later than
originally anticipated. Who knows what

00:40:26.586 --> 00:40:28.179
ramifications that'll have.

00:40:28.179 --> 00:40:30.306
TRAVIS: Just do it, man.

00:40:30.306 --> 00:40:32.796
SAM: Sorry. It's already being done.

00:40:32.796 --> 00:40:35.138
MATT: All right, so.

00:40:35.138 --> 00:40:39.499
SAM: Shit! We should have done that when we were
waiting for fucking Vax!

00:40:39.499 --> 00:40:40.468
LAURA: I know!

00:40:40.468 --> 00:40:42.112
MARISHA: I thought that's what we were doing!

00:40:42.112 --> 00:40:43.645
SAM: I didn't know it takes that long!

00:40:43.645 --> 00:40:46.294
MARISHA: We tried. Wait, we definitely mentioned
that!

00:40:46.294 --> 00:40:48.538
MATT: Simulacrum is a 12-hour casting time.

00:40:48.538 --> 00:40:50.331
SAM: (whispers) Okay.

00:40:50.331 --> 00:40:51.349
TRAVIS: It's okay.

00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:52.719
ASHLEY: It's okay. It's done.

00:40:52.719 --> 00:40:54.652
LAURA: What's done is done.

00:40:54.652 --> 00:40:59.988
MATT: Over the next 12 hours, you sit there
focusing on trying to press your will into this

00:40:59.988 --> 00:41:10.436
congealing snow golem of Scanlan, and watch as it
slowly takes form and breathes air, and-- with no

00:41:10.436 --> 00:41:15.390
equipment, of course-- but has your knowledge,
your spells. Eventually, the completion of the

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:19.973
spell brings to life a secondary Scanlan, under
your beck and call.

00:41:19.973 --> 00:41:26.233
SAM: Oh my god. Hello, Scanlan, is it you?

00:41:26.233 --> 00:41:27.568
MATT: "It's me."

00:41:27.568 --> 00:41:30.337
SAM and MATT: (gasps) Oh!

00:41:30.337 --> 00:41:33.527
SAM: You're shorter than I thought you'd be.

00:41:33.527 --> 00:41:35.264
MATT: "Speak for yourself."

00:41:35.264 --> 00:41:39.170
SAM: All right, let's just see if you're really
Scanlan.

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:41.116
MATT: He's already naked.

00:41:41.116 --> 00:41:50.741
SAM: Oh, okay. Let's see. I whip out my little
measuring tape. One inch, by one inch, by one

00:41:50.741 --> 00:41:55.533
inch. Mm-hmm. That part's the same.

00:41:55.533 --> 00:41:58.518
MATT: "Mm-hmm. How do we know I'm not the real
Scanlan?"

00:41:58.518 --> 00:42:00.435
LAURA: How &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; we know you're not the real
Scanlan?

00:42:00.435 --> 00:42:03.883
SAM: I think there's only one way to find out.

00:42:03.883 --> 00:42:05.409
LIAM: Sing off.

00:42:05.409 --> 00:42:06.816
SAM: (singing) Naa!

00:42:06.816 --> 00:42:17.710
MATT and SAM: (singing in unison) "Naa! Molto
bene, molto bene--"

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:20.990
TALIESIN: Well, that's everything I needed.

00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:24.148
MATT: You're halfway through your sleep.

00:42:24.148 --> 00:42:28.877
LAURA: Shut up, Scanlans!

00:42:28.877 --> 00:42:32.040
TRAVIS: Isn't Wish instantaneous?

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.564
MATT: The spell is instantaneous, unless it's
copying the effect of a spell.

00:42:35.564 --> 00:42:40.503
SAM: All right. This worked. Scanlan, let's go to
sleep.

00:42:40.503 --> 00:42:42.411
MATT: "All right, Scanlan. Where to?"

00:42:42.411 --> 00:42:44.048
SAM: I'll spoon you.

00:42:44.048 --> 00:42:51.429
MATT: "Okay." All right, you guys head off to your
domicile.

00:42:51.429 --> 00:42:54.165
LIAM: This is the last check off your list, I
think.

00:42:54.165 --> 00:42:56.311
TALIESIN: Some items for other Scanlan.

00:42:56.311 --> 00:42:57.947
SAM: Oh, we have extra items?

00:42:57.947 --> 00:42:58.973
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:42:58.973 --> 00:43:02.474
LAURA: Oh, yeah. Other Scanlan can wear things?
He's fully--

00:43:02.474 --> 00:43:04.382
MATT: He can wear things.

00:43:04.382 --> 00:43:07.787
TRAVIS: You want bracers of defense? Plus two to
your AC?

00:43:07.787 --> 00:43:09.175
LAURA: Oh, yeah, put on that armor that I gave
you.

00:43:09.175 --> 00:43:10.438
SAM: Because he doesn't have any of my items, does
he?

00:43:10.438 --> 00:43:11.856
MATT: Nope. He is naked.

00:43:11.856 --> 00:43:15.387
LAURA: Put him in the armor I gave you that you
don't wear.

00:43:15.387 --> 00:43:17.442
SAM: Yes, yes, I will put him in the armor of--

00:43:17.442 --> 00:43:18.882
LAURA: Acid resistance.

00:43:18.882 --> 00:43:20.883
SAM: Acid-- No, I have acid, you had cold.

00:43:20.883 --> 00:43:23.146
LAURA: No, I have cold now. It was--

00:43:23.146 --> 00:43:24.362
SAM: Oh, we had two acids!

00:43:24.362 --> 00:43:25.626
LAURA: Yeah, that's what it was.

00:43:25.626 --> 00:43:26.945
SAM: Yeah. So it's acid resistance.

00:43:26.945 --> 00:43:28.085
MATT: Okay. There you go.

00:43:28.085 --> 00:43:29.365
ASHLEY: I have a shield of fire resistance.

00:43:29.365 --> 00:43:31.894
LAURA: What about the wand of plus one, for the
spells?

00:43:31.894 --> 00:43:34.104
SAM: Wand of plus one, what is that?

00:43:34.104 --> 00:43:36.028
LAURA: It's a war wand.

00:43:36.028 --> 00:43:37.125
SAM: Yeah, great. Do that.

00:43:37.125 --> 00:43:40.054
TALIESIN: And then, here.

00:43:40.054 --> 00:43:45.491
SAM: He's also got bracers of defense, gloves of
missile snaring, and a dragon slayer longsword?

00:43:45.491 --> 00:43:46.530
Sure, why not.

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:50.713
MATT: All right, so you got those. So you go ahead
and find yourself to sleep. The rest of you, the

00:43:50.713 --> 00:43:55.762
night's rest, if there's any final words before
the fray comes, anything you want to do to calm

00:43:55.762 --> 00:43:58.116
yourself before the final battle, now's the time.

00:43:58.116 --> 00:44:00.497
LAURA: Oh god.

00:44:00.497 --> 00:44:02.450
ASHLEY: Fuck.

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:03.619
LAURA: This could be it, huh?

00:44:03.619 --> 00:44:04.915
MARISHA: This is real fucked up.

00:44:04.915 --> 00:44:08.497
TRAVIS: I'm real excited, actually. Like, you
know, you always want to test yourself to see what

00:44:08.497 --> 00:44:12.862
you're made of, what is your mettle really like.
We're going to find out. We're really going to

00:44:12.862 --> 00:44:15.724
find out. Nobody else excited?

00:44:15.724 --> 00:44:18.452
TALIESIN: I don't know if &lt;i&gt;excited&lt;/i&gt; is the word.

00:44:18.452 --> 00:44:26.427
MARISHA: There's been a few times that we've all
known we could die together, but this might

00:44:26.427 --> 00:44:28.446
actually be it.

00:44:28.446 --> 00:44:31.481
LAURA: Oh. That's true.

00:44:31.481 --> 00:44:32.828
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:44:32.828 --> 00:44:36.551
LAURA: You know what? We're doing it for a good
cause, though. Saving the world.

00:44:36.551 --> 00:44:39.082
MARISHA: It's fine. Yeah?

00:44:39.082 --> 00:44:41.968
TRAVIS: Yeah. Together, right?

00:44:41.968 --> 00:44:44.308
SAM and ASHLEY: Together.

00:44:44.308 --> 00:44:47.323
TALIESIN and LAURA: No regrets.

00:44:47.323 --> 00:44:50.228
LIAM: These last three or four years have been the
best of my life.

00:44:50.228 --> 00:44:54.864
MARISHA: Same.

00:44:54.864 --> 00:44:56.519
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:44:56.519 --> 00:45:00.697
LAURA: I had a good run a few years before that,
but this is pretty great.

00:45:00.697 --> 00:45:03.100
TALIESIN: I'm going to remember that you said
that.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:08.052
SAM: Last year I was a crime boss, but the last
few days have been really fun.

00:45:08.052 --> 00:45:16.685
TALIESIN: Everything since I met you all has felt
like a dream. Even the worst of it.

00:45:16.685 --> 00:45:20.139
TRAVIS: I love all of you. (snores)

00:45:20.139 --> 00:45:24.562
MARISHA: Aw, that's so cute; he's honest when he's
asleep.

00:45:24.562 --> 00:45:27.124
TALIESIN: Would it be wrong to shave his beard,
just one more time?

00:45:27.124 --> 00:45:30.969
TRAVIS: (snorts awake before returning to
snoring)

00:45:30.969 --> 00:45:32.611
LIAM: We need his head in the game.

00:45:32.611 --> 00:45:34.964
LAURA: Yeah. It gives him strength.

00:45:34.964 --> 00:45:38.029
MARISHA: I think it's like his focus, you know?

00:45:38.029 --> 00:45:39.483
TRAVIS: Boobies.

00:45:39.483 --> 00:45:41.411
TALIESIN: One of them, yes.

00:45:41.411 --> 00:45:49.762
ASHLEY: I feel like I don't want to go to sleep.

00:45:49.762 --> 00:45:53.230
LAURA: (whispers) I know. We need to, though.

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:56.232
MARISHA: Like, it's weird to say goodnight,
right?

00:45:56.232 --> 00:46:01.868
LAURA: We can totally take this guy. Fuck it.
We're not going down.

00:46:01.868 --> 00:46:05.165
SAM: Yeah.

00:46:05.165 --> 00:46:06.358
LAURA: Yeah.

00:46:06.358 --> 00:46:08.504
SAM: Yeah. He doesn't know what's going to hit
him.

00:46:08.504 --> 00:46:09.586
LAURA: Exactly.

00:46:09.586 --> 00:46:10.997
SAM: We're the S.H.I.T.s.

00:46:10.997 --> 00:46:12.355
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah!

00:46:12.355 --> 00:46:13.530
LAURA: Fuck him.

00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:14.862
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:46:14.862 --> 00:46:19.172
LAURA: We've got other gods on our side. He's a
fucking half-ass god.

00:46:19.172 --> 00:46:21.154
ASHLEY: That's true.

00:46:21.154 --> 00:46:44.773
LAURA: That's right. And you-- You're not going
anywhere.

00:46:44.773 --> 00:46:47.722
MARISHA: All right. Good night?

00:46:47.722 --> 00:46:49.929
LAURA: Good night.

00:46:49.929 --> 00:46:51.445
TALIESIN: In the morning.

00:46:51.445 --> 00:46:57.041
LIAM: Yeah, Percy, get your rest, because your
last words to me tomorrow need to be indignant and

00:46:57.041 --> 00:46:58.829
irritated.

00:46:58.829 --> 00:47:01.732
TALIESIN: I've already planned them out.

00:47:01.732 --> 00:47:03.127
LIAM: Goodnight, brother.

00:47:03.127 --> 00:47:04.796
TALIESIN: Goodnight, brother.

00:47:04.796 --> 00:47:06.489
TRAVIS: And we sleep.

00:47:06.489 --> 00:47:13.663
MATT: All right. You all find yourselves resting,
uncomfortable at first, but the knowledge and the

00:47:13.663 --> 00:47:20.929
exhaustion hitting you, eventually it takes you.
The dreams lead seamlessly, one to the next.

00:47:20.929 --> 00:47:28.955
Memories of your meeting, of your story, of your
experiences, bleeding between your fears, your

00:47:28.955 --> 00:47:36.025
victories, and the people whose lives you've
touched and who've touched your lives. Of Wilhand.

00:47:36.025 --> 00:47:51.379
The fall of Kevdak. To the respect of your father,
and the vengeance of your mother. To climbing the

00:47:51.379 --> 00:48:01.538
destiny of the Aramente. To rebuilding the memory
of one's family.

00:48:01.538 --> 00:48:03.544
And to spooning a second version of yourself.

00:48:03.544 --> 00:48:15.391
(laughing)

00:48:15.391 --> 00:48:21.212
LIAM: (singing) Oh, my darling, I hunger for your
touch--

00:48:21.212 --> 00:48:34.941
MATT: And knowing that you've taken your faith
from a place of being forgotten to a newly built

00:48:34.941 --> 00:48:48.128
symbol of hope. These thoughts all mingle, as the
dark of rest takes you. And as you all awake, in

00:48:48.128 --> 00:48:54.033
the center of this strange, mystical meadow,
peeking through the hints of purple and orange

00:48:54.033 --> 00:49:02.646
that signify the sky that breaks through the
canopy of this forest, the pools of Nala that once

00:49:02.646 --> 00:49:09.946
brought you here long ago. You all awake, the beds
gone, the tents gone. You're all lying amongst

00:49:09.946 --> 00:49:17.864
this field in a circle, around each other. As you
come to consciousness, you all sit up, take a

00:49:17.864 --> 00:49:28.090
breath, feel the warmth and the knowledge of what
has to be done wash over you, the shadow between

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:36.897
two distant trees reveals the orange mane of
Artagan once more, as he steps forth, his high

00:49:36.897 --> 00:49:42.547
green collar disappearing into his long sleeves,
and a cloak that billows past his shoulders and

00:49:42.547 --> 00:49:51.218
loops into his back, as he almost glides
effortlessly through the grass. "I take it you all

00:49:51.218 --> 00:49:52.788
"slept well?"

00:49:52.788 --> 00:49:55.141
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:49:55.141 --> 00:50:03.728
MATT: "Well, then. Time is of the essence. You've
been here more than a day."

00:50:03.728 --> 00:50:07.126
LAURA: Just barely.

00:50:07.126 --> 00:50:16.078
MATT: "Just know. But whenever you're ready. I'll
see what I can whip up." As he wipes his fingers

00:50:16.078 --> 00:50:21.187
against each other, you can see the sparkle,
spiral of purples and blues and oranges and

00:50:21.187 --> 00:50:26.274
colors, causing this glow under his face and his
hair as he gets excited at the prospect of seeing

00:50:26.274 --> 00:50:31.082
just how far he can tweak the boundaries of the
Feywild that he calls home.

00:50:31.082 --> 00:50:35.790
MARISHA: All right.

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:43.145
TALIESIN: Here we go.

00:50:43.145 --> 00:50:47.308
TRAVIS: What are you holding over there?

00:50:47.308 --> 00:50:51.434
SAM: Myself. My other hand.

00:50:51.434 --> 00:50:53.553
LAURA: Trinket's back in the necklace for the
bamfing over.

00:50:53.553 --> 00:50:55.074
MATT: Okay.

00:50:55.074 --> 00:51:04.546
MARISHA: To Thar Amphala. On the back of a titan.
On the Material Plane.

00:51:04.546 --> 00:51:10.979
MATT: "Take them." As you concentrate, and the
spell begins to swell around you, this familiar

00:51:10.979 --> 00:51:16.965
energy begins to ride up in your stomach. You feel
the butterflies take form. And as the realm begins

00:51:16.965 --> 00:51:23.026
to darken, the colors that you see, spiraling out
of Artagan's hands, begin to consume you as well.

00:51:23.026 --> 00:51:28.789
And nausea takes over and you feel yourself
wretched left and right, as darkness begins to

00:51:28.789 --> 00:51:32.897
swell once more and close in, the colors surround
you entirely. And you feel like you're being

00:51:32.897 --> 00:51:37.397
pushed through a window. As you all land and catch
your feet, the darkness subsides, the color

00:51:37.397 --> 00:51:41.003
subsides, and you all feel immediately queasy,
falling to your knees.

00:51:41.003 --> 00:51:47.523
As you glance around you, you can see you stand in
the rubble, the exterior of a building that has

00:51:47.523 --> 00:51:53.966
fallen long ago. You see large chunks of the
secondary floor fallen inward and dust (poof)

00:51:53.966 --> 00:51:59.447
around you as your knees hit. You look up and can
see the familiar green-blue crackle of the barrier

00:51:59.447 --> 00:52:04.989
above you. You've managed to make it on the
interior of Thar Amphala. You look up to see,

00:52:04.989 --> 00:52:10.395
immediately, clusters of gloomstalkers in the
distance. They haven't quite gotten a view on you.

00:52:10.395 --> 00:52:11.897
LAURA: In the building, now!

00:52:11.897 --> 00:52:14.856
MATT: You guys all dart. Make a stealth check,
please.

00:52:14.856 --> 00:52:18.617
TRAVIS: First roll, first roll, first roll.

00:52:18.617 --> 00:52:19.890
LIAM: Natural 20.

00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:21.462
ALL: Hey!

00:52:21.462 --> 00:52:22.821
MARISHA: Good luck!

00:52:22.821 --> 00:52:24.658
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

00:52:24.658 --> 00:52:26.472
MATT: That's one way to do it.

00:52:26.472 --> 00:52:28.021
MARISHA: Oh, natural 19.

00:52:28.021 --> 00:52:29.268
ALL: Ooh.

00:52:29.268 --> 00:52:31.268
SAM: Scanlan One, 19. Scanlan Two, 21.

00:52:31.268 --> 00:52:32.738
TALIESIN: 19.

00:52:32.738 --> 00:52:34.686
MARISHA: 28.

00:52:34.686 --> 00:52:36.014
LAURA: 35.

00:52:36.014 --> 00:52:37.339
ASHLEY: 18.

00:52:37.339 --> 00:52:38.859
TRAVIS: 11.

00:52:38.859 --> 00:52:44.853
MATT: Okay. This building is mostly collapsed;
there's a small alcove in the corner where part of

00:52:44.853 --> 00:52:48.266
the secondary story is still there. You guys dart
into the side of it and you rest there for a

00:52:48.266 --> 00:52:54.938
minute in quiet. (nervous breathing) And you
suddenly hear an impact of stone against the wall

00:52:54.938 --> 00:52:59.709
behind you. All of you guys immediately turn
around and you watch as the heavy piece of stone

00:52:59.709 --> 00:53:05.458
that marks the outer part of this building is now
cracked, and part of it begins to fall in. I need

00:53:05.458 --> 00:53:09.182
Scanlan One, real Scanlan, and Percy to make
dexterity saving throws, please.

00:53:09.182 --> 00:53:13.819
SAM: Not good. Ten.

00:53:13.819 --> 00:53:18.487
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn a resolve.

00:53:18.487 --> 00:53:19.988
TRAVIS: Burning it already?

00:53:19.988 --> 00:53:21.270
SAM: What?

00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:22.890
TALIESIN: I rolled really low. I want to do that a
little better.

00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:24.196
LIAM: So take a conk on the head!

00:53:24.196 --> 00:53:25.236
TALIESIN: Oh, fine.

00:53:25.236 --> 00:53:26.388
LAURA: No, you don't know! You don't know!

00:53:26.388 --> 00:53:27.534
TALIESIN: I don't know-- which is why I am.

00:53:27.534 --> 00:53:29.126
MATT: What are you going to do? Are you going take
it or not?

00:53:29.126 --> 00:53:31.862
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to kill a resolve, one
more. That's way better! Natural 20.

00:53:31.862 --> 00:53:34.278
MATT: Okay, cool. You only take three points of
bludgeoning damage.

00:53:34.278 --> 00:53:35.280
TALIESIN: That'll do.

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.310
MATT: Scanlan takes six.

00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:37.575
TALIESIN: It's just a resolve; I got three.

00:53:37.575 --> 00:53:39.001
TRAVIS: Six points.

00:53:39.001 --> 00:53:40.483
MATT: You reduced three points of damage.

00:53:40.483 --> 00:53:42.498
LAURA: I thought they could be trapped under the
wall or something.

00:53:42.498 --> 00:53:46.259
TALIESIN: No, it was fair. I'm not in the mood for
that. And resolves I got plenty of.

00:53:46.259 --> 00:53:51.535
MATT: It crumples over onto you. You manage to
pull away. As you turn around, you can see, right

00:53:51.535 --> 00:53:58.676
around the edge of the part of the building that's
collapsed and fallen, a gloomstalker, covered in

00:53:58.676 --> 00:54:03.266
dust, shaking its head as it attempts to stand
once more. It looks like it's been slammed to

00:54:03.266 --> 00:54:08.758
the ground, or crashed into this wall. And you can
see it's on the ground, (croaking noises), shaking

00:54:08.758 --> 00:54:11.740
its head and trying to get back up, its wings
trying to unfurl.

00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:18.629
As it rights its head, you see a leaping blur of
black armor and red scales climb to the back of

00:54:18.629 --> 00:54:23.823
the beast, grasping the side of its shoulders as
it spins back and forth, trying to shake it. You

00:54:23.823 --> 00:54:29.390
see this humanoid figure, trying to take something
and throw it around its throat and its head,

00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:34.671
however, it's just not able to grasp it around,
and gets thrown off the side and to the back. You

00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:39.195
watch as the gloomstalker bucks off the assailant
and begins to try and get its wings up once more,

00:54:39.195 --> 00:54:43.565
as the figure leaps up again and shoulder slams it
into the wall a second time. You get a better look

00:54:43.565 --> 00:54:51.068
at it now. You can see now, standing at a pretty
decent height, about a seven-foot dragonborn of

00:54:51.068 --> 00:54:58.471
red scale and black, hooked armor, bladed and
angry. You see a burning fury in its eyes. Joe, if

00:54:58.471 --> 00:54:59.960
you want to come to the table, please.

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.444
ALL: Ooh!

00:55:01.444 --> 00:55:09.999
(cheering)

00:55:09.999 --> 00:55:13.576
LIAM: Welcome to the table!

00:55:13.576 --> 00:55:15.925
SAM: What's this?

00:55:15.925 --> 00:55:22.311
(cheering and laughing)

00:55:22.311 --> 00:55:23.658
JOE: Yes!

00:55:23.658 --> 00:55:25.263
TRAVIS: Brothers in arms! Yeah!

00:55:25.263 --> 00:55:27.120
TALIESIN: I like that it's kitty-corner right
now.

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:31.808
JOE: The tanks on the ends.

00:55:31.808 --> 00:55:39.061
MATT: Arkhan. You've been trying to wrestle this
gloomstalker down-- You spent days here, trying to

00:55:39.061 --> 00:55:43.492
find a way to recover from the circumstances that
left you here. This is the closest thing you've

00:55:43.492 --> 00:55:46.429
had at this circumstance, as you've regained your
strength, and as you leap onto its back, it

00:55:46.429 --> 00:55:50.379
continues to knock you off to the side. You guys
see this confrontation happening. What do you do?

00:55:50.379 --> 00:55:53.755
LAURA: Does it look like-- (pained noise)

00:55:53.755 --> 00:55:55.141
TRAVIS: No, I'll run in.

00:55:55.141 --> 00:55:57.526
LIAM: Yeah, he's attacking a gloomstalker; I'll
join in.

00:55:57.526 --> 00:55:59.180
MATT: All right, so what are you guys doing?

00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:01.011
LIAM: I'm going to help this guy out and throw.

00:56:01.011 --> 00:56:04.127
MATT: All right, so go ahead and make two
attacks.

00:56:04.127 --> 00:56:06.432
LIAM: All right. Plus one to--

00:56:06.432 --> 00:56:09.033
JOE: Wait, don't hurt him! Don't hurt him; I
scream: Don't hurt him.

00:56:09.033 --> 00:56:10.651
MATT: Well, he's thrown two daggers.

00:56:10.651 --> 00:56:12.725
LIAM: I did, and they both hit.

00:56:12.725 --> 00:56:15.666
MATT: Yes. Technically adjacent, so you do sneak
attack damage.

00:56:15.666 --> 00:56:16.795
LIAM: All right, I will.

00:56:16.795 --> 00:56:19.050
SAM: Oh boy.

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:25.377
LIAM: Four-- It could be bad. 12--

00:56:25.377 --> 00:56:29.915
TALIESIN: Oh, wow. What are you doing?

00:56:29.915 --> 00:56:31.805
LAURA: All of the damage.

00:56:31.805 --> 00:56:34.986
TRAVIS: Save it for battle!

00:56:34.986 --> 00:56:37.023
LIAM: 34, 35-- I can't! It's too late; it's
triggered!

00:56:37.023 --> 00:56:38.554
LAURA: No! Don't do it!

00:56:38.554 --> 00:56:40.872
LIAM: 46 for the first.

00:56:40.872 --> 00:56:43.219
SAM: I cover tiny Scanlan's eyes.

00:56:43.219 --> 00:56:46.312
LAURA: Welcome to the game, Joe!

00:56:46.312 --> 00:56:49.142
TRAVIS: This is what we do.

00:56:49.142 --> 00:56:50.979
MARISHA: Yeah, what were you &lt;i&gt;trying&lt;/i&gt; to do?

00:56:50.979 --> 00:56:52.653
JOE: I hope you have a healing potion.

00:56:52.653 --> 00:56:53.988
SAM: Nope.

00:56:53.988 --> 00:57:01.565
MATT: That's 51 points of damage. You have 46 and
four? It's 50 points of damage. Marking that down.

00:57:01.565 --> 00:57:06.186
You see two daggers into the side of the
gloomstalker. It gives this horrible shrieking

00:57:06.186 --> 00:57:09.311
shout in pain and rears up.

00:57:09.311 --> 00:57:13.789
JOE: Now that it's distracted, does that give me
some sort of advantage?

00:57:13.789 --> 00:57:21.283
MATT: I will say, given the pain it's had, make an
athletics check because you are attempting to grapple

00:57:21.283 --> 00:57:22.725
the entity.

00:57:22.725 --> 00:57:24.913
JOE: That's correct. All right, okay.

00:57:24.913 --> 00:57:28.997
LAURA: Can we see, does it look like he's got
hands and eyes complete?

00:57:28.997 --> 00:57:32.167
JOE: That's athletics, that's going to be a 19.

00:57:32.167 --> 00:57:34.685
MATT: Natural 20.

00:57:34.685 --> 00:57:39.171
JOE: Is it part dragon?

00:57:39.171 --> 00:57:42.174
MATT: No. It is not. It's considered a
monstrosity.

00:57:42.174 --> 00:57:44.686
JOE: Okay, fair enough. Okay.

00:57:44.686 --> 00:57:51.829
MATT: That's okay. You hear the dragonborn shout
out, seeing the dagger slam into its side. What do

00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:53.694
you yell to them as they're attacking it?

00:57:53.694 --> 00:57:56.499
JOE: Don't hurt this thing. Help me wrestle it to
the ground.

00:57:56.499 --> 00:58:01.385
MATT: At which point, it now thrusts the
dragonborn off of its back. He goes tumbling and

00:58:01.385 --> 00:58:04.008
rolling onto the ground, landing onto your back,
and you see it--

00:58:04.008 --> 00:58:06.584
LAURA: I throw out the Rope of Entanglement. On
the gloomstalker.

00:58:06.584 --> 00:58:09.798
MARISHA: I turn to Percy, and I go: Who's fighting
who?!

00:58:09.798 --> 00:58:11.320
TALIESIN: I don't know!

00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:15.105
MATT: So now I would like an initiative roll from
everybody, please.

00:58:15.105 --> 00:58:16.870
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Oh shit.

00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:20.940
TRAVIS: What's that? Plus a d10 to my initiative
now?

00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:24.296
SAM: Does Scanlan Two take my initiative, or no?

00:58:24.296 --> 00:58:26.675
MATT: Separately.

00:58:26.675 --> 00:58:29.983
LAURA: You're two people again! How does it feel?

00:58:29.983 --> 00:58:31.608
SAM: The best.

00:58:31.608 --> 00:58:33.501
MATT: 25 to 20, anybody?

00:58:33.501 --> 00:58:34.485
LAURA: 24.

00:58:34.485 --> 00:58:36.584
SAM: Natural 20, which made a 23.

00:58:36.584 --> 00:58:37.864
TRAVIS: 22.

00:58:37.864 --> 00:58:43.379
MATT: All right. Grog-- All right. Super low. All
right, 20 to 15?

00:58:43.379 --> 00:58:47.067
JOE and MARISHA: 17.

00:58:47.067 --> 00:58:49.475
SAM: Oh, sorry, Scanlan Two is also 21.

00:58:49.475 --> 00:58:54.022
LIAM: Joe, you're sitting on Scanlan Two.

00:58:54.022 --> 00:58:57.599
MATT: All right. 15 to ten?

00:58:57.599 --> 00:59:02.400
TALIESIN: 12. No, really?

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:07.708
ASHLEY: Well, would I be Pike without rolling shit
initiative?

00:59:07.708 --> 00:59:09.704
MATT: Vax, what'd you get?

00:59:09.704 --> 00:59:10.746
LIAM: Eight.

00:59:10.746 --> 00:59:12.578
MATT: Eight, wow. What'd you get, Pike?

00:59:12.578 --> 00:59:14.010
ASHLEY: Yes. A six.

00:59:14.010 --> 00:59:20.319
MATT: All right, so. Vex, you're up first. You're
going to use the--

00:59:20.319 --> 00:59:24.656
LAURA: The Rope of Entanglement, is what I was
going for. I can't find my--

00:59:24.656 --> 00:59:30.335
MATT: I have the sheet here. So you thrust it out.
It has to make a DC 15 dexterity saving throw.

00:59:30.335 --> 00:59:31.464
LAURA: Yeah.

00:59:31.464 --> 00:59:38.951
MATT: All right. Let's see here-- Natural one.
Natural 20 to natural one. Back to back. As you

00:59:38.951 --> 00:59:41.956
fall onto your back and shout that out, you go
rushing towards it and you watch as this glowing,

00:59:41.956 --> 00:59:46.719
long piece of thick rope begins to suddenly wrap
around this gloomstalker as it's trying to take

00:59:46.719 --> 00:59:51.111
off again. It gets, like, a foot off the ground
before its wings get pulled up to its body, and it

00:59:51.111 --> 00:59:54.942
falls back onto the ground, wrapped and restrained
by the rope.

00:59:54.942 --> 00:59:58.246
JOE: Great. I can do my thing now?

00:59:58.246 --> 01:00:00.894
MATT: Is anybody else going to do anything, right
now?

01:00:00.894 --> 01:00:04.300
TRAVIS: Yeah, I run up. I'm going to run up, and
grab it by the head and neck and lay on it.

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.893
MATT: Okay. Scanlans?

01:00:05.893 --> 01:00:10.506
SAM: I'm just watching. And I turn to Scanlan Two
and say: So that's a gloomstalker.

01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:11.633
TALIESIN: "Yes."

01:00:11.633 --> 01:00:15.296
SAM: And that guy, I'm not sure what he is, but he
looks really cool.

01:00:15.296 --> 01:00:17.407
TALIESIN: "&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; know what he is. I'm not going to
tell you, though."

01:00:17.407 --> 01:00:21.020
MATT: All right, Arkhan.

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:29.960
JOE: I remove this golden-needled, five-jeweled
wreath from around my neck, and I approach the

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:33.365
beast, and I fasten it around its neck.

01:00:33.365 --> 01:00:37.830
SAM and TRAVIS: Shock collar.

01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:40.029
MATT: Kind of. So it's a DC 17.

01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:42.130
TRAVIS: If it barks, it activates.

01:00:42.130 --> 01:00:49.436
MATT: Five plus six, that's an eleven. It does not
succeed. You watch as the thrashing around

01:00:49.436 --> 01:00:55.838
gloomstalker on the ground begins to slowly calm
down until it reaches a point where it's not

01:00:55.838 --> 01:01:03.625
moving; it's breathing, and you almost hear what
sounds like a reverse purr.

01:01:03.625 --> 01:01:07.404
JOE: Does this thing have horns?

01:01:07.404 --> 01:01:14.205
MATT: It has a series of spines along the back of
the neck, but no actual horns. It has a head that

01:01:14.205 --> 01:01:19.554
flares out like a cobra, but it's made of shadow.
Where the jaw is, its tongue lashes out, but

01:01:19.554 --> 01:01:22.433
instead of saliva, it gives off smoke.

01:01:22.433 --> 01:01:28.813
JOE: Then I grab it by the back of the jaw, here,
and I put my forehead down to its forehead, and I

01:01:28.813 --> 01:01:34.414
close my eyes, and then open them, and they turn
into that thing's eyes, correct?

01:01:34.414 --> 01:01:35.615
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:01:35.615 --> 01:01:37.083
JOE: Yeah.

01:01:37.083 --> 01:01:42.567
MATT: So the gloomstalkers, they have no
discernible pupil; it's a glowing beacon of

01:01:42.567 --> 01:01:49.095
yellow-white where each eye is. And you watch as
this dragonborn opens its eyes, it's headbutted

01:01:49.095 --> 01:01:53.765
against it, and the dragonborn's eyes now match
the coloration of the gloomstalker.

01:01:53.765 --> 01:01:56.024
JOE: I climb up onto its back.

01:01:56.024 --> 01:02:00.988
MATT: Okay. It's still bound by the rope. But you
get up onto it now. You watch as this massive

01:02:00.988 --> 01:02:06.477
dragonborn gets up onto the gloomstalker, which is
now currently on the ground, trying to right

01:02:06.477 --> 01:02:08.158
itself now, still wrapped in the rope.

01:02:08.158 --> 01:02:10.299
JOE: You can release the rope now.

01:02:10.299 --> 01:02:11.860
LAURA: Does it look like anybody's noticed us?

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.256
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:02:13.256 --> 01:02:18.510
SAM: We've been fighting silently.

01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:24.158
LAURA: 33.

01:02:24.158 --> 01:02:30.722
MATT: You do look and see two more gloomstalkers
that have broken away from the cluster, that are

01:02:30.722 --> 01:02:32.537
making their way in your direction.

01:02:32.537 --> 01:02:37.092
LAURA: Will this thing obey you? We should get
inside. I let go of the rope and go back in the

01:02:37.092 --> 01:02:39.092
building so that we can hide.

01:02:39.092 --> 01:02:40.398
MATT: Okay. Everyone else following?

01:02:40.398 --> 01:02:41.883
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:43.523
MATT: Everyone else following suit?

01:02:43.523 --> 01:02:44.567
SAM: Yes.

01:02:44.567 --> 01:02:45.673
MATT: Okay. You?

01:02:45.673 --> 01:02:46.875
JOE: Yeah. Absolutely.

01:02:46.875 --> 01:02:49.557
MATT: All right. Do you leave the gloomstalker
where it is and then step inside with them?

01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:50.908
JOE: Can I take it with me?

01:02:50.908 --> 01:02:52.020
MATT: If you want to.

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.385
JOE: I'd like to take it with me.

01:02:53.385 --> 01:02:57.747
MATT: As you guys all dart inside this alcove in
the building-- Like, most of the roof is gone;

01:02:57.747 --> 01:03:02.713
there's a section of roof that's there. It can
hide most of you. The gloomstalker's a bit large,

01:03:02.713 --> 01:03:07.514
as you all cluster into the space, as it looms in.
(heavy footsteps) This is the second time you've

01:03:07.514 --> 01:03:12.858
had an allied gloomstalker this close, and it's a
very upsetting proximity.

01:03:12.858 --> 01:03:16.480
MARISHA: Uncomfortable elevator at a convention.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:20.292
MATT: Kind of. As you guys pull into the side, I'd
like you all to make a stealth check, please.

01:03:20.292 --> 01:03:22.176
MARISHA: Why did you wear wings?

01:03:22.176 --> 01:03:23.367
LAURA: Stealth check!

01:03:23.367 --> 01:03:29.668
JOE: If I'm on its back, does that have anything
to do with my plate armor? Meaning, am I relying

01:03:29.668 --> 01:03:34.387
on some form of stalking that doesn't make my
armor clank around?

01:03:34.387 --> 01:03:39.631
MATT: Unfortunately, as you're still riding it and
it moves and shifts, there is still the plate

01:03:39.631 --> 01:03:41.691
sitting against it, so you would still be at a
disadvantage.

01:03:41.691 --> 01:03:42.991
JOE: Am I the only one in plate armor here?

01:03:42.991 --> 01:03:44.517
LAURA: No, she's got plate armor.

01:03:44.517 --> 01:03:45.728
ASHLEY: Nope. Clanky twins!

01:03:45.728 --> 01:03:47.516
JOE: I just didn't want to be fully responsible.

01:03:47.516 --> 01:03:49.540
TRAVIS: She has something that makes her less
clanky-like.

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:51.207
LAURA: Yeah, you got your boots.

01:03:51.207 --> 01:03:52.453
ASHLEY: Boots!?

01:03:52.453 --> 01:03:54.146
LAURA: Yeah, so you don't roll at disadvantage
anymore.

01:03:54.146 --> 01:03:55.350
ASHLEY: Wait, wait.

01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:56.901
LAURA: Yeah. You got non-clanky boots.

01:03:56.901 --> 01:03:59.604
JOE: And I am at disadvantage? (sighs)

01:03:59.604 --> 01:04:04.649
LAURA: Add ten to your roll.

01:04:04.649 --> 01:04:06.402
SAM: Yeah, you're fine.

01:04:06.402 --> 01:04:07.616
JOE: Okay. 20.

01:04:07.616 --> 01:04:08.786
TRAVIS: Aw, yeah!

01:04:08.786 --> 01:04:09.889
JOE: Disadvantage.

01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:11.665
MATT: By the way, there's your stat sheet for the
gloomstalker.

01:04:11.665 --> 01:04:13.012
JOE: Yes!

01:04:13.012 --> 01:04:15.021
MATT: It's taken 50 damage, so you can note that.

01:04:15.021 --> 01:04:16.727
JOE: Can I feed it a healing potion?

01:04:16.727 --> 01:04:18.743
MATT: When you have a moment you can, yeah.

01:04:18.743 --> 01:04:24.782
JOE: Yeah. Trust me. It's all going to work out.
What could go wrong?

01:04:24.782 --> 01:04:29.482
LIAM: You were jumping at him, and punching him in
the face. I thought wrong. I do that sometimes.

01:04:29.482 --> 01:04:31.220
ASHLEY: Do you have a name for him?

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:32.622
SAM: Do &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; have a name?

01:04:32.622 --> 01:04:35.452
ASHLEY: Do you have a name? That's true. I just
love animals.

01:04:35.452 --> 01:04:39.624
SAM: We can kill you any second, so be scared of
us, if you're an evil person.

01:04:39.624 --> 01:04:42.912
JOE: You could. But I know these two.

01:04:42.912 --> 01:04:44.356
SAM: What?

01:04:44.356 --> 01:04:47.818
MATT: And there's a moment of recognition for
Percival and Keyleth.

01:04:47.818 --> 01:04:50.072
MARISHA: Oh, holy shit.

01:04:50.072 --> 01:04:51.416
TRAVIS: No way.

01:04:51.416 --> 01:04:54.652
MARISHA: Oh. It's been, like-- two years?

01:04:54.652 --> 01:04:56.097
TALIESIN: At least two years.

01:04:56.097 --> 01:05:01.020
JOE: At least. Percival, you've aged. Keyleth, you
still look the same.

01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:02.918
MARISHA: (giggles)

01:05:02.918 --> 01:05:04.250
TALIESIN: She got a haircut.

01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:06.908
LAURA: Oh, shit. Are you going to let him do that
to your girl?

01:05:06.908 --> 01:05:10.599
MATT: It's at this moment you hear two heavy
impacts from nearby rooftops.

01:05:10.599 --> 01:05:15.803
TRAVIS: Okay. Maybe not the best reunion time.

01:05:15.803 --> 01:05:22.260
MATT: As you all stay as silent as possible,
waiting, one of them takes off. And you can see it

01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:28.617
arc barely over the opening, but seems to be doing
a wide sweep, out of visual range. The other one

01:05:28.617 --> 01:05:37.991
appears to be stalking from rooftop to rooftop,
not far from you. (thudding) (sniffing and

01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:52.815
croaking) It leaps and lands on top of the small
part of the roof that's above you guys. It holds.

01:05:52.815 --> 01:06:07.348
A few rocks tumble around you as you're quietly in
that space, hoping. (thudding and croaking) Its

01:06:07.348 --> 01:06:10.922
head peeks over the edge and looks straight down,
right into all of you.

01:06:10.922 --> 01:06:12.958
LAURA: Oh, God darn it.

01:06:12.958 --> 01:06:14.628
MATT: What are you doing?

01:06:14.628 --> 01:06:17.556
LAURA: I shoot an arrow into its eyeball.

01:06:17.556 --> 01:06:22.960
MATT: Okay. So as soon as the head passes over,
make your attacks. You're close enough to get one

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.498
swipe up, because you're on the back of a
gloomstalker. So as its head peeks down, you can

01:06:26.498 --> 01:06:28.173
get a strike at it.

01:06:28.173 --> 01:06:29.335
TRAVIS: How high up?

01:06:29.335 --> 01:06:32.153
MATT: It's about, I'd say, 12 to 15 feet up.

01:06:32.153 --> 01:06:33.533
LAURA: 35.

01:06:33.533 --> 01:06:34.910
MATT: That hits.

01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:38.973
JOE: That's going to be a 31.

01:06:38.973 --> 01:06:40.600
MATT: That hits.

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:48.484
JOE: Damn, that's a Vox Machina number. About damn
time. That's what level 17 will get you. All

01:06:48.484 --> 01:06:49.984
right. Yeah.

01:06:49.984 --> 01:06:51.597
MATT: All righty. So.

01:06:51.597 --> 01:06:53.057
LIAM: 20, 21, and a miss.

01:06:53.057 --> 01:06:54.725
MATT: Okay. So those both hit.

01:06:54.725 --> 01:06:55.801
LAURA: 25 damage.

01:06:55.801 --> 01:06:57.188
MATT: 25 damage, all righty.

01:06:57.188 --> 01:07:00.000
LAURA: Oh, and I get to do it again?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.145
MATT: You do.

01:07:01.145 --> 01:07:04.417
LIAM: Is his proximity close enough that either of
these guys are within five feet, or anybody's

01:07:04.417 --> 01:07:05.278
within--?

01:07:05.278 --> 01:07:08.667
MATT: No. Oh, I'd say Arkhan probably is.

01:07:08.667 --> 01:07:10.483
LAURA: 18?

01:07:10.483 --> 01:07:12.776
MATT: 18 damage?

01:07:12.776 --> 01:07:14.236
LAURA: 18, does that hit?

01:07:14.236 --> 01:07:15.496
MATT: That does hit, yeah.

01:07:15.496 --> 01:07:16.958
LAURA: Okay.

01:07:16.958 --> 01:07:18.733
SAM: Come on, insta-kill this thing.

01:07:18.733 --> 01:07:20.894
MARISHA: I know. I don't want to have to do
anything.

01:07:20.894 --> 01:07:22.211
LAURA: 18.

01:07:22.211 --> 01:07:23.403
MATT: Okay.

01:07:23.403 --> 01:07:30.194
JOE: This is the paladin dilemma. I think I'm
going to save the spell slots. But I am going to

01:07:30.194 --> 01:07:32.084
swing at this guy.

01:07:32.084 --> 01:07:33.253
MATT: Go for it.

01:07:33.253 --> 01:07:39.821
JOE: Okay, I'm going to swing my battleaxe,
Fane-Eater.

01:07:39.821 --> 01:07:42.665
MATT: Okay. So you get two attacks with that.

01:07:42.665 --> 01:07:44.629
JOE: Great. Oh, okay. Well, one was 31.

01:07:44.629 --> 01:07:45.749
MATT: Yep.

01:07:45.749 --> 01:07:53.972
JOE: Oh, that's going to be nine, plus 14. That's
23 points of damage on the first one. And then

01:07:53.972 --> 01:07:58.386
second attack is going to be a 23.

01:07:58.386 --> 01:07:59.617
MATT: That hits.

01:07:59.617 --> 01:08:04.213
JOE: And that's going to be 21 points of damage on
the second.

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:10.845
MATT: All right. And with that, as soon as its
head peeks over the edge, two arrows (whooshing)

01:08:10.845 --> 01:08:17.329
under its throat, and you watch as an axe cuts
part of its head clean off, as it tries to make a

01:08:17.329 --> 01:08:21.512
noise, but the blade is caught in its throat and
prevents the air passage. As Fane-Eater is yanked

01:08:21.512 --> 01:08:25.920
out of the side, you see the jagged edge of the
axe arc back, causing blood to splatter across the

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:31.718
back, the wall behind him, as Arkhan goes in with a
second swipe. And with one clean cleave motion,

01:08:31.718 --> 01:08:38.167
the head falls and plummets into the ground. The
rest of the gloomstalker tumbles in, lifeless,

01:08:38.167 --> 01:08:43.442
into the rock. And you see as it lands, its wings
sprawl out and slowly the body begins to dissolve

01:08:43.442 --> 01:08:45.406
into black smoke and shadow.

01:08:45.406 --> 01:08:50.211
SAM: I run out and I say: Wait! Don't kill it! I'm
just kidding. It's fine.

01:08:50.211 --> 01:08:55.120
TALIESIN: Vox Machina, may we introduce you to
Arkhan?

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.747
SAM: Arkhan?

01:08:56.747 --> 01:08:57.949
MARISHA: Arkhan.

01:08:57.949 --> 01:08:58.946
SAM: Hi.

01:08:58.946 --> 01:09:04.475
MARISHA: You look like you've, you know-- You look
like us. You got more stuff. We've acquired more

01:09:04.475 --> 01:09:06.474
stuff, over the years. That's cool.

01:09:06.474 --> 01:09:07.810
SAM: How do you know this gentleman?

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.167
TALIESIN: We did some work, ages ago.

01:09:09.167 --> 01:09:11.091
MARISHA: Yeah, forever. Before we really knew any
of you.

01:09:11.091 --> 01:09:12.335
JOE: The temple of Shumash.

01:09:12.335 --> 01:09:13.604
LAURA: How did you get here?

01:09:13.604 --> 01:09:16.187
MARISHA: It was a crappy swamp. It was good times.
Yeah.

01:09:16.187 --> 01:09:18.078
MATT: Technically it was a desert, but yeah.

01:09:18.078 --> 01:09:20.545
MARISHA: It was a crappy desert. Good times.

01:09:20.545 --> 01:09:23.034
SAM: Well, it was the worst kind of swamp. It was
one with no water.

01:09:23.034 --> 01:09:26.171
MARISHA: It was, yes. The driest of swamps, yeah.

01:09:26.171 --> 01:09:28.324
TALIESIN: What are you doing here?

01:09:28.324 --> 01:09:40.377
JOE: That's a long story. Weeks ago, we wound up
attacked by a cult, my companions and I. This cult

01:09:40.377 --> 01:09:45.886
was led by a Death Knight. And a sorcerous
woman.

01:09:45.886 --> 01:09:47.448
SAM: Lady Briarwood.

01:09:47.448 --> 01:09:49.091
MARISHA: Sylas?

01:09:49.091 --> 01:09:55.489
JOE: And then Vecna followed. And we were
ambushed. My companions and I were marked for

01:09:55.489 --> 01:10:03.443
death. They were all destroyed. And I watched that
Death Knight burn the closest thing I've ever had

01:10:03.443 --> 01:10:12.977
to a brother. And he cut the still-beating heart
out of our goliath. And then these buzzards came

01:10:12.977 --> 01:10:21.763
to pick my bones, thinking I was dead. But I
wouldn't die. The queen had another plan for me.

01:10:21.763 --> 01:10:26.829
SAM: The queen? What kind of queen?

01:10:26.829 --> 01:10:28.317
JOE: I hold up my shield.

01:10:28.317 --> 01:10:30.775
MATT: Make a religion check, Scanlan.

01:10:30.775 --> 01:10:35.702
SAM: Hm, that's no good. 11?

01:10:35.702 --> 01:10:42.621
MATT: You have passing knowledge that the symbols
that adorn both around Arkhan's throat and the

01:10:42.621 --> 01:10:50.576
shield that he holds up are that of the Scaled
Tyrant, Tiamat, which is the patron god to

01:10:50.576 --> 01:10:53.786
chromatic and evil dragons all across the world.

01:10:53.786 --> 01:10:59.010
LAURA: Oh, he's evil. That's evil. That's the evil
dragon. Potentially.

01:10:59.010 --> 01:11:00.575
SAM: You serve this queen?

01:11:00.575 --> 01:11:02.271
TALIESIN: He's our kind of evil. It's fine.

01:11:02.271 --> 01:11:08.123
JOE: I understand that because of my dogma, we
belong to groups that would never mix, but I can

01:11:08.123 --> 01:11:14.240
assure you, if you help me get revenge on the one
that killed my friends, I swear to you, I will

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:18.214
fight for your lives with the fury of a man who is
already dead.

01:11:18.214 --> 01:11:21.447
TALIESIN: I think we have a surprising amount
already in common.

01:11:21.447 --> 01:11:23.196
TRAVIS: Good pitch.

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:27.428
SAM: Devil's advocate: maybe not. I don't know,
maybe--

01:11:27.428 --> 01:11:30.283
LIAM: I mean, I'm just going to do an insight
check on principle.

01:11:30.283 --> 01:11:34.413
JOE: I make the gloomstalker snarl at the two
Scanlans.

01:11:34.413 --> 01:11:36.708
MATT: (snarls)

01:11:36.708 --> 01:11:39.022
LIAM: Yeah, I rolled an eight. He checks out.

01:11:39.022 --> 01:11:49.404
MARISHA: Quick question. We didn't roll our
temporary hit points for our Heroes' Feast.

01:11:49.404 --> 01:11:51.396
MATT: Oh, you did not. You should do that.

01:11:51.396 --> 01:11:53.354
MARISHA: Can we do that? Or does Pike do that for
us?

01:11:53.354 --> 01:11:55.316
MATT: Yeah, Pike, you roll the temporary hit
points.

01:11:55.316 --> 01:11:59.508
MARISHA: For all of us, right? It's an additional
2d10, I'm pretty sure.

01:11:59.508 --> 01:12:02.665
MATT: So roll 2d10, Pike. And everyone who was
present for that--

01:12:02.665 --> 01:12:05.621
LAURA: Oh, yeah, you should give us a speech. How
long does that last?

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:07.855
MARISHA: Oh, I totally should've given a speech.

01:12:07.855 --> 01:12:10.086
LIAM: That's a ten-minute one, yeah?

01:12:10.086 --> 01:12:13.973
MARISHA: No, it's a short rest thing. But it's a
thing that lasts until--

01:12:13.973 --> 01:12:15.553
LAURA: Later, then.

01:12:15.553 --> 01:12:18.187
MARISHA: Yeah. I should've done that before, but
I'll do it next time.

01:12:18.187 --> 01:12:20.291
SAM: Whatcha doing over there, Johnson?

01:12:20.291 --> 01:12:21.987
ASHLEY: I'm just looking for my tens!

01:12:21.987 --> 01:12:25.582
LAURA: Oh no!

01:12:25.582 --> 01:12:26.692
LIAM: Two ones.

01:12:26.692 --> 01:12:27.741
MARISHA: Two ones?

01:12:27.741 --> 01:12:28.835
ASHLEY: Wait, are these 12s?

01:12:28.835 --> 01:12:30.280
LAURA: No, those are tens.

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:34.037
MATT: All right. So you guys gain two additional
hit points, to your max hit points.

01:12:34.037 --> 01:12:36.943
LAURA: That is such a bummer.

01:12:36.943 --> 01:12:39.198
JOE: Is that everybody?

01:12:39.198 --> 01:12:43.554
MATT: Yeah. You weren't there for the meal,
unfortunately. It's from earlier.

01:12:43.554 --> 01:12:45.851
LAURA: It's okay; the meal didn't do a lot,
apparently.

01:12:45.851 --> 01:12:49.503
ASHLEY: So glad I'm here to be useful.

01:12:49.503 --> 01:12:54.529
MATT: However, everyone does still have their
advantage on wisdom saving throws and you're

01:12:54.529 --> 01:12:57.991
immune to fear. Which is pretty huge.

01:12:57.991 --> 01:12:59.254
MARISHA: And poison.

01:12:59.254 --> 01:13:02.703
MATT: And poison. The hit points are more of,
like, a bonus. You're fine.

01:13:02.703 --> 01:13:04.009
LIAM: It was slim fast. Slim feast.

01:13:04.009 --> 01:13:05.836
MATT and MARISHA: Slim feast!

01:13:05.836 --> 01:13:07.583
JOE: Can I feed this thing a healing potion?

01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:08.902
MATT: You may.

01:13:08.902 --> 01:13:12.681
ASHLEY: I really thought I was going to roll two
tens.

01:13:12.681 --> 01:13:14.007
JOE: Greater? I think greater.

01:13:14.007 --> 01:13:15.252
MATT: If you have, yeah--

01:13:15.252 --> 01:13:16.151
JOE: I have a greater.

01:13:16.151 --> 01:13:18.490
MATT: So that would be 4d4 plus four.

01:13:18.490 --> 01:13:20.924
ASHLEY: I rolled the wrong, I actually rolled the
wrong tens.

01:13:20.924 --> 01:13:25.203
JOE: That's nine; that's not great.

01:13:25.203 --> 01:13:29.252
SAM: No, that's not great. We'll figure it out
later.

01:13:29.252 --> 01:13:30.860
TALIESIN: We know Lay on Hands and some such.

01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:32.605
JOE: Well, I have them, I just don't want to blow
them.

01:13:32.605 --> 01:13:33.909
TRAVIS: Wait. You can't die?

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:37.348
SAM: Is that true? Wait, when did he say he
couldn't die?

01:13:37.348 --> 01:13:40.347
TRAVIS: Well, he said, like, "She thought I was
dead, but my queen--"

01:13:40.347 --> 01:13:43.067
SAM: He said he would fight like a man who is
dead, but he wasn't--

01:13:43.067 --> 01:13:44.591
TALIESIN: It was a metaphor, Grog. It was a
metaphor.

01:13:44.591 --> 01:13:46.052
SAM: Oh, no, you're right.

01:13:46.052 --> 01:13:48.390
LIAM: Do you mean actually; have you died?

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:54.524
JOE: It's kind of a colloquialism for religious
folk. You know what I mean? Like, I hit a death save.

01:13:54.524 --> 01:13:56.852
LAURA: Oh, tight, tight, tight, tight.

01:13:56.852 --> 01:14:00.532
SAM: I touch him to see if he's real.

01:14:00.532 --> 01:14:06.569
JOE: I blow smoke out of my nostrils, like a
little fire.

01:14:06.569 --> 01:14:10.333
SAM: Kind of squishy. Really soft.

01:14:10.333 --> 01:14:12.168
TRAVIS: Thank god he's wearing that armor, huh?

01:14:12.168 --> 01:14:14.215
SAM: Yeah. Pudgy.

01:14:14.215 --> 01:14:20.608
JOE: I'm going to pump 30, then, back into this
gloomstalker. Plus the nine. So there was, what,

01:14:20.608 --> 01:14:21.920
51 that came off?

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.713
MATT: 50 points of damage were taken off.

01:14:23.713 --> 01:14:25.510
JOE: 50 points, so I put 39 back on, so that's 11
off.

01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:26.842
MATT: Yep, you got it.

01:14:26.842 --> 01:14:30.506
TRAVIS: When do we want to do Freedom of Movement
stuff? Not yet?

01:14:30.506 --> 01:14:31.586
LIAM: That's short term.

01:14:31.586 --> 01:14:38.519
LAURA: Right before. That only lasts for an hour.
Here's the thing. Do we go for the outer walls to

01:14:38.519 --> 01:14:44.183
take out the shield first? Probably. Once we go
in, we're going in.

01:14:44.183 --> 01:14:45.897
SAM: The outer walls of the city?

01:14:45.897 --> 01:14:47.511
LAURA: Of Thar Amphala, yes.

01:14:47.511 --> 01:14:49.281
SAM: How are we going to take down entire walls
without being--

01:14:49.281 --> 01:14:51.547
LAURA: We don't have to take out the walls. We
have to break a couple of the crystals.

01:14:51.547 --> 01:14:56.065
MARISHA: Yeah, those crystals that we started to
break when we were in the Shadowfell.

01:14:56.065 --> 01:14:59.541
TALIESIN: If just do a hit and run, we can cause
so much chaos that all of these gloomstalkers are

01:14:59.541 --> 01:15:01.519
going to be busy dealing with everything in the
air.

01:15:01.519 --> 01:15:06.767
LAURA: Hey! You remember our old plan of just set
everything on fire? Let's set everything on fire!

01:15:06.767 --> 01:15:12.831
MARISHA: Yeah! In fact, that's actually a
brilliant plan. We could disable a crystal, maybe

01:15:12.831 --> 01:15:17.630
I could light a signal, distract people. While
they're distracted, we make it to the next one.

01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:21.068
TALIESIN: And as long as we're close to that one,
they don't know that we're here. They can't see us.

01:15:21.068 --> 01:15:22.339
JOE: What are these crystals?

01:15:22.339 --> 01:15:25.406
SAM: We don't know where these crystals are!

01:15:25.406 --> 01:15:28.428
TALIESIN: They're all around the outer wall.

01:15:28.428 --> 01:15:30.287
LAURA: We saw them when we were in the city
before.

01:15:30.287 --> 01:15:35.084
MARISHA: Yeah, in the Shadowfell. Remember, we
jabbed at one, and decided against it.

01:15:35.084 --> 01:15:36.397
SAM: All right.

01:15:36.397 --> 01:15:38.797
TALIESIN: If we break these crystals, this could
help--

01:15:38.797 --> 01:15:40.178
MARISHA: Everything.

01:15:40.178 --> 01:15:43.326
TRAVIS: Does anyone know that you're here?

01:15:43.326 --> 01:15:48.923
JOE: Vecna. The female wizardess.

01:15:48.923 --> 01:15:50.473
LAURA: She knows?

01:15:50.473 --> 01:15:52.145
JOE: And the Death Knight.

01:15:52.145 --> 01:15:56.104
TALIESIN: And if they've been watching, he just
vanished. We should run now.

01:15:56.104 --> 01:15:58.730
JOE: But they thought I was dead. They left me for
dead.

01:15:58.730 --> 01:16:02.780
LAURA: So they don't necessarily know you're in the
city.

01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:05.050
JOE: I think they'd be surprised to see me.

01:16:05.050 --> 01:16:06.549
LAURA: Okay. All right, cool.

01:16:06.549 --> 01:16:07.706
MARISHA: Let's move.

01:16:07.706 --> 01:16:11.534
LAURA: Okay, stealthily, let's try to make it to
the outer wall so that we can cut out some of

01:16:11.534 --> 01:16:12.677
these crystals.

01:16:12.677 --> 01:16:16.770
MATT: Okay. First off, make a perception check as
you glance out to see how close you are to the

01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:18.067
nearby wall.

01:16:18.067 --> 01:16:20.858
LAURA: 30.

01:16:20.858 --> 01:16:26.853
MATT: 30, okay. You notice you're on a different
part of the city than you were previously. If the

01:16:26.853 --> 01:16:35.831
city's moving forward, if you consider the
direction that the titan is traversing

01:16:35.831 --> 01:16:44.257
forward, you guys were to the back and right side
of Thar Amphala. Like a clock; if twelve o'clock

01:16:44.257 --> 01:16:50.225
is where it was traveling, you guys were around
four or five o'clock. Looking now at the layout of

01:16:50.225 --> 01:16:58.084
the city, you're closer to 11 and 12 right now.
And you're maybe about 200 feet from the nearest

01:16:58.084 --> 01:17:03.303
wall. You can see the curvature of the dome is
pretty striking from your current position. And

01:17:03.303 --> 01:17:09.540
you can see the pulses, the waves. Imagine like a
reverse waterfall of energy shooting upward. And

01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:12.449
every now and then, there's a burst.

01:17:12.449 --> 01:17:16.336
LAURA: Does it look like there's an area that the
pulses are brighter, along the wall?

01:17:16.336 --> 01:17:21.879
MATT: Yes. You do see the pulses aren't universal.
There are certain locations, about six of them

01:17:21.879 --> 01:17:25.383
throughout the city, that you occasionally see
them (bursting), and they spread out.

01:17:25.383 --> 01:17:26.749
LAURA: Are we close to one of those pulses?

01:17:26.749 --> 01:17:29.654
MATT: You can maneuver there. It's not directly
behind you, but you can eventually get to that

01:17:29.654 --> 01:17:30.693
location, yeah.

01:17:30.693 --> 01:17:33.332
LAURA: Okay. I see where one of the crystals is;
let's move towards that.

01:17:33.332 --> 01:17:37.055
TALIESIN: We'll get Grog to smash it to
smithereens.

01:17:37.055 --> 01:17:38.697
TRAVIS: I smash (stumbling) mitheens.

01:17:38.697 --> 01:17:41.380
ASHLEY: You do. To mitheens.

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:42.725
TRAVIS: (drawn out) Mitheens.

01:17:42.725 --> 01:17:44.332
TALIESIN: You're so good at punching walls.

01:17:44.332 --> 01:17:48.463
MATT: All right. I would like you all to make a
stealth check. Are you all walking on foot? Are

01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:49.969
you taking the gloomstalker?

01:17:49.969 --> 01:17:51.086
JOE: I'm on top of the gloomstalker.

01:17:51.086 --> 01:17:52.443
SAM: Is it walking?

01:17:52.443 --> 01:17:53.434
MATT: Yeah.

01:17:53.434 --> 01:17:55.074
JOE: It's walking right now?

01:17:55.074 --> 01:17:57.427
MATT: It's currently walking, unless you want to
hover with it.

01:17:57.427 --> 01:17:59.733
SAM: You got to stay within 60 feet of us? 30
feet?

01:17:59.733 --> 01:18:01.139
MATT: 60 feet.

01:18:01.139 --> 01:18:02.250
JOE: I'd like to hover.

01:18:02.250 --> 01:18:09.286
MATT: As you guys are staying lowkey, Arkhan is
currently riding against the back of this

01:18:09.286 --> 01:18:14.820
gloomstalker as it's hovering in the air above. And
the stealth check you're going to be rolling is

01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:19.862
going to be to see whether or not anything notices
you on the back of a gloomstalker. The

01:18:19.862 --> 01:18:24.447
gloomstalker is not going to register on the radar
of any of the current watching creatures, because

01:18:24.447 --> 01:18:27.113
it's part of its posse for the moment.

01:18:27.113 --> 01:18:30.221
JOE: So is this with disadvantage for plate armor,
or not?

01:18:30.221 --> 01:18:32.735
MATT: I would say no, because it isn't a
movement-based stealth check; you're just trying

01:18:32.735 --> 01:18:34.083
to stay still.

01:18:34.083 --> 01:18:35.384
JOE: With the bonus.

01:18:35.384 --> 01:18:36.457
LAURA: Plus ten.

01:18:36.457 --> 01:18:40.823
JOE: Love it. Good. 31.

01:18:40.823 --> 01:18:47.764
MATT: Shit, all right. You're just clutching the
exterior of it, trying to stay low. You're pulling

01:18:47.854 --> 01:18:54.279
into your armor like a turtle shell, since it is
black. And using that to try and blend into its form

01:18:54.279 --> 01:18:57.097
SAM: And can we kind of stay under the shadow of
the gloomstalker?

01:18:57.097 --> 01:18:58.473
MATT: You guys can move along.

01:18:58.473 --> 01:19:00.214
SAM: Oh, 29 and 20.

01:19:00.214 --> 01:19:01.316
TALIESIN: 34.

01:19:01.316 --> 01:19:02.350
MATT: Keyleth?

01:19:02.350 --> 01:19:03.345
MARISHA: 32.

01:19:03.345 --> 01:19:04.211
MATT: Vax?

01:19:04.211 --> 01:19:06.142
LIAM: I rolled a four, so it's 37.

01:19:06.142 --> 01:19:07.404
MATT: Fucking rogue.

01:19:07.404 --> 01:19:08.468
LAURA: 29.

01:19:08.468 --> 01:19:09.482
ASHLEY: 18.

01:19:09.482 --> 01:19:10.423
TRAVIS: What?

01:19:10.423 --> 01:19:13.686
ASHLEY: No, I did it wrong.

01:19:13.686 --> 01:19:14.942
TRAVIS: Oh. 19.

01:19:14.942 --> 01:19:16.071
MATT: Okay.

01:19:16.071 --> 01:19:17.648
SAM: His head has muscles.

01:19:17.648 --> 01:19:24.026
MATT: Okay. A five and a six. All right, so. As you
guys begin to maneuver through the streets,

01:19:24.026 --> 01:19:28.849
dodging from building to building, on the
outskirts of Thar Amphala, thankfully, the streets

01:19:28.849 --> 01:19:33.488
are a little more sparse on the edges. You also
notice as you're traversing, and this is

01:19:33.488 --> 01:19:35.137
interesting.

01:19:35.137 --> 01:19:40.818
JOE: It's his head shot.

01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:45.819
LAURA: I would have liked if he had signed it.

01:19:45.819 --> 01:19:49.163
JOE: It's Arkhan's commercial head shot.

01:19:49.163 --> 01:19:51.307
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You need to print one
in black and white.

01:19:51.307 --> 01:19:53.933
LIAM: (deep voice) If I'm good at reproductions.

01:19:53.933 --> 01:19:56.554
JOE: This is, like, work in the office look.

01:19:56.554 --> 01:20:00.091
MARISHA: (laughing) That's such an L.A. joke,
yeah.

01:20:00.091 --> 01:20:06.226
MATT: All right, so. As you guys are maneuvering,
Vax, Vex, and Keyleth as well. You have the high

01:20:06.226 --> 01:20:12.614
passive perception of the group. You notice that
the droves of undead that have been clogging the

01:20:12.614 --> 01:20:17.057
streets of this city, and the clusters of cultists
that have been running about busily, running from

01:20:17.057 --> 01:20:22.531
location to location, with some work on their
midst. The undead, who were just scattered and

01:20:22.531 --> 01:20:30.220
wandering, are now unified and moving in patterns.
They're now being driven by some intent. Whereas

01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:36.301
once they were just scattered amongst, and in a
holding pattern, now they're maneuvering with

01:20:36.301 --> 01:20:42.438
solid purpose, away from the sides of the wall,
and the shields, which enables you to go

01:20:42.438 --> 01:20:49.854
relatively unnoticed. But you're seeing them now,
gathering towards similar tunnels to the one you

01:20:49.854 --> 01:20:57.221
came up in. You can see dozens and dozens of
zombies and skeletons, and the occasional robed

01:20:57.221 --> 01:21:03.129
cultist, both warrior and mage alike, all
beginning to make their way down into the titan,

01:21:03.129 --> 01:21:05.000
at various points in the city.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.322
SAM: Making their way &lt;i&gt;down&lt;/i&gt;.

01:21:06.322 --> 01:21:08.350
TALIESIN: They're going to go attack the city.

01:21:08.350 --> 01:21:11.698
LAURA: We got to get these shields down so that
Vasselheim can actually have--

01:21:11.698 --> 01:21:13.887
MARISHA and LIAM: A fighting chance.

01:21:13.887 --> 01:21:16.120
TRAVIS: Let's find the crystals.

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.409
MARISHA: All right, let's do it.

01:21:17.409 --> 01:21:23.347
MATT: As you guys make your way around the edge of
the city, you follow these pulses. They occur

01:21:23.347 --> 01:21:27.447
every two minutes or so, so you have to keep an
eye out for it until one happens and then reorient

01:21:27.447 --> 01:21:34.847
your direction, but you taking point on this, you
lead everybody, darting from place to place. Man.

01:21:34.847 --> 01:21:37.292
Rolling shitty-ass perception.

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:38.404
TRAVIS: That's okay, Matt.

01:21:38.404 --> 01:21:39.671
MATT: That's okay for you guys.

01:21:39.671 --> 01:21:40.963
TRAVIS: Let it happen.

01:21:40.963 --> 01:21:47.622
MATT: Eventually, you come around one cluster of
exterior buildings. It looks to be what was once a

01:21:47.622 --> 01:21:53.509
manor, that was converted to a fortress. Like a
small exterior fortress to this inner circle of

01:21:53.509 --> 01:22:00.137
Thar Amphala. You curve around and there you see,
familiar to you from once before, the walls that

01:22:00.137 --> 01:22:05.768
surround the exterior of this inner sanctum of
Thar Amphala, and the basis of this field that

01:22:05.768 --> 01:22:13.394
contains the entirety of the city. Looking at the
wall, you can already feel the dangerous vibration

01:22:13.394 --> 01:22:19.972
of this field being so close. There's this violent
hum to the air, that with each pulse hits this

01:22:19.972 --> 01:22:26.207
certain frequency of sound that causes your ear to
tweak just a hint. And you can see violent waves

01:22:26.207 --> 01:22:33.500
of green-blue magical energy, (pulsing) up the
side of the wall, like a very powerful reverse

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:40.814
waterfall. Shooting up, to gather and maintain
this field. You cannot see the crest. The crest

01:22:40.814 --> 01:22:45.700
was visible from the outside of the wall. And the
energy field is being produced on the outside of

01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:51.030
the wall. You're on the inside of it. But you can
gather the base location of where this burst is

01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:53.436
happening to get an idea of loosely where it might
be.

01:22:53.436 --> 01:22:55.352
LAURA: How thick is the wall?

01:22:55.352 --> 01:22:57.040
MATT: You don't know.

01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:02.394
LAURA: And we saw the crest before because there
was a doorway in the outer wall.

01:23:02.394 --> 01:23:03.505
MATT: Correct. Yes.

01:23:03.505 --> 01:23:05.225
LAURA: Is there any kind of doorway around us?

01:23:05.225 --> 01:23:08.577
MATT: You glance over to where the door was, below
the crest, before, and you can see the opposite

01:23:08.577 --> 01:23:15.532
side of a door, currently, yes. It is shut. And
appears to be made of hard wood with-- It's iron

01:23:15.532 --> 01:23:18.139
bar reinforced crosshatch.

01:23:18.139 --> 01:23:21.380
LIAM: Well, we can try the door, and then if that
doesn't work, Grog can make a new one.

01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:23.144
LAURA: Yeah.

01:23:23.144 --> 01:23:24.532
LIAM: Let me check out the door.

01:23:24.532 --> 01:23:34.872
TRAVIS: I'm not really so keen on &lt;i&gt;making&lt;/i&gt; doors,
as opposed to knocking them down. I'm a craftsman.

01:23:34.872 --> 01:23:36.510
All right. I'm just, me.

01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:38.617
LIAM: I'm going to check and see if the door is
trapped.

01:23:38.617 --> 01:23:40.288
LAURA: How are you with doors?

01:23:40.288 --> 01:23:41.845
JOE: Pretty good.

01:23:41.845 --> 01:23:45.383
TRAVIS and JOE: Yeah!

01:23:45.383 --> 01:23:46.753
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Sh!

01:23:46.753 --> 01:23:48.565
LIAM: 26.

01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:50.505
MATT: Thankfully only rolled a nine.

01:23:50.505 --> 01:23:59.426
LIAM: 26 for investigation on the door.

01:23:59.426 --> 01:24:01.661
MATT: The door is locked, but it is not trapped.

01:24:01.661 --> 01:24:03.362
LIAM: All right. Let's open it up.

01:24:03.362 --> 01:24:06.765
JOE: I hand Grog some jerky from my pouch.
Hungry?

01:24:06.765 --> 01:24:09.602
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck yeah. Don't share it.

01:24:09.602 --> 01:24:13.586
LIAM: 28.

01:24:13.586 --> 01:24:22.674
MATT: 28, okay. So the door (clicks). And it's
interesting, as you put your lockpicks in to feel

01:24:22.674 --> 01:24:28.700
the tumblers, you can feel the metal vibrating.
Like the entire door is just (buzzes). And as you

01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:32.521
hit it, and the door swings open, almost like
something's been pushing it on the opposite side.

01:24:32.521 --> 01:24:39.131
It swings open and slams on the inside of the
frame, and there you're looking at a wall of

01:24:39.131 --> 01:24:45.393
violent green arcane energy. (whoosh) Coasting
by-- Actually, this is blasting downward right

01:24:45.393 --> 01:24:50.043
now, because the threshold crest, as you recall,
was above the doorway, in the wall.

01:24:50.043 --> 01:24:52.122
LAURA: Can we see it? Like above the doorway?

01:24:52.122 --> 01:24:53.412
MATT: No, it's flush.

01:24:53.412 --> 01:24:54.688
LAURA: It's like on the other side?

01:24:54.688 --> 01:24:56.925
MATT: It's on the other side and up on the wall.
And currently where the door opens, there is

01:24:56.925 --> 01:24:59.364
violent magical energy slamming down.

01:24:59.364 --> 01:25:03.972
LAURA: Do you think it's possible to, like, punch
up on the archway and knock the crystal down?

01:25:03.972 --> 01:25:09.714
LIAM: I pick up a rock about that big, walk ten
feet back, and throw it at the energy.

01:25:09.714 --> 01:25:14.916
MATT: It hits the field, and there's a violent
flash in that section, about a foot radius around

01:25:14.916 --> 01:25:18.886
where it was, and the rock shoots past you. Make a
dexterity saving throw.

01:25:18.886 --> 01:25:24.475
LIAM: Ooh, that's not good. 16.

01:25:24.475 --> 01:25:29.247
MATT: 16? Strange. Wow! That's the first time
you've failed a dex save in a long time!

01:25:29.247 --> 01:25:30.439
LIAM: Yeah, I rolled a three.

01:25:30.439 --> 01:25:31.670
MATT: Oh, thank god.

01:25:31.670 --> 01:25:34.441
LAURA: So happy about it.

01:25:34.441 --> 01:25:35.906
MARISHA: You are fallible.

01:25:35.906 --> 01:25:44.237
MATT: You take six points of bludgeoning damage.
That's a d4 plus two. But it literally pelts you

01:25:44.237 --> 01:25:49.154
in the side of jaw and the neck, and you turn
around and feel it. And you can feel the pulsing

01:25:49.154 --> 01:25:51.733
of the blood begin to flow into the bruise that's
going to be there tomorrow.

01:25:51.733 --> 01:25:57.206
LIAM: I literally just got choked to death 18 hours
ago, so I'm not sweating it. What're we going to do?

01:25:57.206 --> 01:26:00.010
TALIESIN: Grog? Let's start drilling up.

01:26:00.010 --> 01:26:01.662
LAURA: Try punching up.

01:26:01.662 --> 01:26:06.549
SAM: All right, but if we interfere with that
forcefield and it somehow hits us, we're going to

01:26:06.549 --> 01:26:07.650
be hurting.

01:26:07.650 --> 01:26:11.367
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. Not only should we back up a
little bit, except for me, we should also have an

01:26:11.367 --> 01:26:14.944
area that we're going to run to, right? Because
I'm sure this will bring the noise.

01:26:14.944 --> 01:26:19.036
MARISHA and LAURA: Is there a house nearby?

01:26:19.036 --> 01:26:22.277
MATT: There's about a 20 foot gap between the wall
and any nearby building, and there is the large,

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:29.516
fortress-like manor that you saw earlier. I mean,
I say fortress-like manor; it's not a huge house.

01:26:29.516 --> 01:26:35.015
It's two story and a decent size. But it looks
like it's been reinforced in the walls, like

01:26:35.015 --> 01:26:39.098
somebody had designed for it to be a place to hold
off some sort of a stand, probably from the war

01:26:39.098 --> 01:26:43.218
with Pelor's army, long ago. That's the closest
thing to this doorway.

01:26:43.218 --> 01:26:46.783
LAURA: Okay, we can get ready to run there.
However, we're staying within 60 feet of you while

01:26:46.783 --> 01:26:47.831
you're punching.

01:26:47.831 --> 01:26:49.608
TRAVIS: Arkhan's going to stay, just in case it
needs, like, a double--

01:26:49.608 --> 01:26:50.768
LAURA: A double punch.

01:26:50.768 --> 01:26:51.799
TRAVIS: Yeah. You know.

01:26:51.799 --> 01:26:54.591
MATT: It's probably more than 20 feet, actually;
it's probably like 30, 40 feet.

01:26:54.591 --> 01:26:55.611
LAURA: 30 feet away?

01:26:55.611 --> 01:26:56.712
MATT: Yeah.

01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:59.646
JOE: How many gloomstalker riders are in the sky
above?

01:26:59.646 --> 01:27:03.923
MATT: I mean, overall? Make a perception check.

01:27:03.923 --> 01:27:12.299
JOE: Okay. Yikes. Eight.

01:27:12.299 --> 01:27:14.946
MATT: There's a lot of them.

01:27:14.946 --> 01:27:16.603
TRAVIS: Sky's clear.

01:27:16.603 --> 01:27:20.099
MATT: Like, there's a lot of them by Entropis.

01:27:20.099 --> 01:27:22.033
JOE: Gloomstalker shit hits me in the face.

01:27:22.033 --> 01:27:31.415
MATT: Yeah. But you do notice that there's-- where
previously there wasn't, there's a cloud gathering at the

01:27:31.415 --> 01:27:35.699
top of this dome funneling down onto Entropis.

01:27:35.699 --> 01:27:39.438
TRAVIS: Actually. Well, hold on. You got to stay
here, right? Because of the--

01:27:39.438 --> 01:27:41.911
LAURA: That's what I said; I'm staying within 60
feet of you.

01:27:41.911 --> 01:27:43.351
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

01:27:43.351 --> 01:27:44.350
MATT: Okay.

01:27:44.350 --> 01:27:48.254
TRAVIS: And I go: Tiger Uppercut! and I just punch
the roof of it.

01:27:48.254 --> 01:27:50.618
MATT: Go ahead and make an attack.

01:27:50.618 --> 01:27:53.288
LIAM: Destroy.

01:27:53.288 --> 01:27:55.310
TRAVIS: Yeah, destroy. 23.

01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:58.637
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage, d4 plus
your strength modifier.

01:27:58.637 --> 01:28:05.373
TRAVIS: That is 15. Just by itself. So.

01:28:05.373 --> 01:28:08.409
MATT: Times two. That's 30 points of damage with a
punch.

01:28:08.409 --> 01:28:10.705
SAM: One Punch Man.

01:28:10.705 --> 01:28:18.295
MATT: Fucking siege, man. That's good. As you slam
into it, you guys watch as, right above the

01:28:18.295 --> 01:28:24.701
doorway, in the door frame, the entire wall-- Just
a spider crack shoots up about 20-- The wall is

01:28:24.701 --> 01:28:30.967
about 30 feet tall or so. Actually, probably not.
It's about 20 or so feet. And it cracks up to the

01:28:30.967 --> 01:28:36.274
very top, and you watch as large parts of it break
off and fall, but it hasn't completely collapsed.

01:28:36.274 --> 01:28:38.152
But it's sustained some very serious damage.

01:28:38.152 --> 01:28:39.874
TALIESIN: One more and we run. And take cover.

01:28:39.874 --> 01:28:40.917
TRAVIS: One more?

01:28:40.917 --> 01:28:42.116
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:28:42.116 --> 01:28:46.437
MATT: I also need you to go ahead and make a
constitution saving throw, please.

01:28:46.437 --> 01:28:49.541
LIAM: I'm going to walk up behind him--

01:28:49.541 --> 01:28:52.734
JOE: He's within ten feet of me. He gets a plus
four.

01:28:52.734 --> 01:28:54.248
LIAM: And plus two from me.

01:28:54.248 --> 01:28:57.097
MATT: Awesome. Well, they don't stack.

01:28:57.097 --> 01:28:58.213
LIAM: Doesn't stack?

01:28:58.213 --> 01:28:59.409
MATT: The plus four is what you get.

01:28:59.409 --> 01:29:00.996
LIAM: Then I'm backing the fuck up.

01:29:00.996 --> 01:29:03.410
MATT: From the aura.

01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:07.554
JOE: Aura of Protection. Provided by Tiamat!

01:29:07.554 --> 01:29:09.499
TRAVIS: 24.

01:29:09.499 --> 01:29:22.668
MATT: 24? All right. You suffer-- it would be 14
points of force damage, reduced to seven and you're

01:29:22.668 --> 01:29:28.330
pushed back 20 feet, but you're not knocked prone.
So as you slam into it, there's a burst of arcane

01:29:28.330 --> 01:29:32.780
energy out of that section of the doorway and wall
that slams into you. You go spinning past,

01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:36.132
spiraling, and you catch yourself on the ground
about 20 feet away, in the middle of the open

01:29:36.132 --> 01:29:38.026
there. Catch yourself.

01:29:38.026 --> 01:29:40.055
LIAM: Feet skidding, like a Jackie Chan film.

01:29:40.055 --> 01:29:43.376
MATT: Still don't fucking see you, okay.

01:29:43.376 --> 01:29:45.851
TALIESIN: It's a very loud--

01:29:45.851 --> 01:29:48.143
MATT: I'm rolling so shitty today.

01:29:48.143 --> 01:29:50.113
SAM: Yeah, well. You're going to roll well when it
counts.

01:29:50.113 --> 01:29:51.341
JOE: I'll take a shot.

01:29:51.341 --> 01:29:52.322
MATT: You take a shot as well?

01:29:52.322 --> 01:29:53.171
JOE: Yeah.

01:29:53.171 --> 01:29:56.997
MATT: All right. So as Grog spins back and catches
himself, you walk up to this doorframe. With your

01:29:56.997 --> 01:29:58.077
axe in hand?

01:29:58.077 --> 01:29:58.913
JOE: Yeah.

01:29:58.913 --> 01:30:00.305
MATT: Go for it. Roll an attack.

01:30:00.305 --> 01:30:04.686
JOE: Okay, that's going to be a 19.

01:30:04.686 --> 01:30:06.105
MATT: 19 hits.

01:30:06.105 --> 01:30:07.533
LAURA: 19 hits a wall!

01:30:07.533 --> 01:30:09.484
MATT: It's an AC of 18 on the wall.

01:30:09.484 --> 01:30:12.180
SAM: The wall has an AC of 18?

01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:15.094
TALIESIN: The wall has my armor class. That's
really horrifying.

01:30:15.094 --> 01:30:17.659
JOE: With my axe--

01:30:17.659 --> 01:30:18.695
MATT: It's solid!

01:30:18.695 --> 01:30:20.247
LAURA: It's a magic wall.

01:30:20.247 --> 01:30:21.708
JOE: That's going to be 20 points of damage.

01:30:21.708 --> 01:30:26.376
MATT: 20 points of damage, that'll do it. So as
Grog catches up, and look up, you watch as Arkhan

01:30:26.376 --> 01:30:32.014
rushes forward, and with a giant leap, cleaves the
axe into the stone. As it does, the archway

01:30:32.014 --> 01:30:34.802
collapses downward. First off, make a constitution
saving throw.

01:30:34.802 --> 01:30:38.505
TRAVIS: I'm standing there like a catcher, ready.

01:30:38.505 --> 01:30:50.606
JOE: Con save? All right. Not big money. This is
not. It's going to be more whammy than big

01:30:50.606 --> 01:30:55.809
money. That's a nine on a con save.

01:30:55.809 --> 01:31:03.199
MATT: That's not going to do it. Okay. You suffer
16 points of force damage, and you get blown back

01:31:03.199 --> 01:31:07.402
into Grog's direction and knocked prone. So you
catch, but the impact actually pushes you back

01:31:07.402 --> 01:31:13.272
five feet, and he falls face first on the ground.
There's actually a dig in the ground, like a

01:31:13.272 --> 01:31:20.894
groove where the impact is. At that point, as you
watch the wall crumble and collapse, you see,

01:31:20.894 --> 01:31:27.938
suddenly dislodged from its position, the about
two and half foot wide threshold crest stone that

01:31:27.938 --> 01:31:33.191
is embedded in the wall there crumples downward
and falls out of its space. As it does, there's a

01:31:33.191 --> 01:31:39.231
series of bursts of vibrant arcane energy that
shoot up the wall, causing this side of the wall

01:31:39.231 --> 01:31:45.588
to glow exponentially brighter than the rest of
the shield. At which point, like a large slice of

01:31:45.588 --> 01:31:54.249
pie, one sixth of the dome falls inward, and for
the first time since you've arrived, you see the

01:31:54.249 --> 01:32:01.779
non-filtered sky above of the darkened clouds that
have completely encased the upper atmosphere of

01:32:01.779 --> 01:32:09.567
Othanzia. You also glance past where it crumbled,
as the city is at a slight angle forward, the way

01:32:09.567 --> 01:32:13.358
it's placed on the front of the titan, and you
look down and see, immediately around, the

01:32:13.358 --> 01:32:19.504
familiar sight of the Vasper Timberlands that
surround the exterior of Vasselheim. And there

01:32:19.504 --> 01:32:27.383
ahead, not more than maybe a few miles off, you
can assume from this distance, you see the

01:32:27.383 --> 01:32:31.501
singular mountain pillar that Vasselheim is built
around, and the outer wall in sight.

01:32:31.501 --> 01:32:36.054
MARISHA: I don't know. Do we keep going? Do we try
to get down some more?

01:32:36.054 --> 01:32:38.641
JOE: Alderaan is in sight!

01:32:38.641 --> 01:32:41.591
TRAVIS: We're coming around that planet.

01:32:41.591 --> 01:32:43.720
TALIESIN: We're going to run.

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:47.266
MATT: Everyone make a perception check, please.

01:32:47.266 --> 01:32:49.660
TRAVIS: I got this, guys; don't worry.

01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:52.463
JOE: Famous last words.

01:32:52.463 --> 01:32:55.142
MARISHA: Opal die, don't fuck me!

01:32:55.142 --> 01:32:56.158
LAURA: 27?

01:32:56.158 --> 01:32:58.024
TALIESIN: 27.

01:32:58.024 --> 01:32:59.123
SAM: 20.

01:32:59.123 --> 01:33:04.405
JOE: Was this passive perception? Because if it
was, then I rolled a natural 20 of passive

01:33:04.405 --> 01:33:09.260
perception. The natural one.

01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:10.568
MARISHA: 18.

01:33:10.568 --> 01:33:11.717
TRAVIS: Three.

01:33:11.717 --> 01:33:12.488
ASHLEY: 12.

01:33:12.488 --> 01:33:23.366
MATT: Okay. Those who got over 20: There's this
small victory, and this moment of joy, and

01:33:23.366 --> 01:33:27.236
accomplishment, that is immediately washed over by
the realization of how close you are to the city.

01:33:27.236 --> 01:33:35.770
The two hours that you were gone, still better
than a full rest, however, has put you within

01:33:35.770 --> 01:33:46.005
proximity of the city. And you hear this familiar,
large, airy, reedy, stretched screech in the

01:33:46.005 --> 01:33:55.087
distance. You glance over, and you see in the
distance, barreling down in your direction, a

01:33:55.087 --> 01:33:57.958
skeletal dragon familiar to you not far before.

01:33:57.958 --> 01:33:59.198
MARISHA: Move, move, move!

01:33:59.198 --> 01:34:00.612
SAM: I don't think we're going to be able to
move.

01:34:00.612 --> 01:34:01.899
LIAM: We can hide, though.

01:34:01.899 --> 01:34:03.253
TRAVIS: We're going to hide?

01:34:03.253 --> 01:34:05.148
LIAM: We can't run.

01:34:05.148 --> 01:34:10.659
LAURA: At least get in this building, there was
that encased part, right?

01:34:10.659 --> 01:34:13.175
SAM: We're all in the same enclosed space?

01:34:13.175 --> 01:34:14.210
LIAM: Ring.

01:34:14.210 --> 01:34:20.207
MATT: There's a tower-like structure, and then
there's that building that was reinforced to be a--

01:34:20.207 --> 01:34:22.572
TRAVIS: If he spots us, we scatter and spread,
but.

01:34:22.572 --> 01:34:25.810
TALIESIN: We are not going to scatter and spread.
We're going to stay together no matter what.

01:34:25.810 --> 01:34:28.053
LAURA: We're going to stay within 60 feet of each
other.

01:34:28.053 --> 01:34:29.556
TALIESIN: There is no scattering.

01:34:29.556 --> 01:34:32.509
LAURA: Within 60 feet of us. It's super
important!

01:34:32.509 --> 01:34:36.563
MATT: If you all are rushing into this building,
everyone make a stealth check, please.

01:34:36.563 --> 01:34:40.774
JOE: Is this a hovering stealth check?

01:34:40.774 --> 01:34:46.068
MATT: If you want to still stay out in the open,
that is up to you. They're all darting into a

01:34:46.068 --> 01:34:51.570
building, so the choice is yours. You can stay
with your beast.

01:34:51.570 --> 01:34:55.314
JOE: But he's one of them. So I can kind of leave
him outside somewhat.

01:34:55.314 --> 01:34:56.829
MATT: He is. You're on top of him.

01:34:56.829 --> 01:34:57.903
JOE: Yeah, I am.

01:34:57.903 --> 01:35:00.304
MATT: So. Do you want to try and blend into his
form?

01:35:00.304 --> 01:35:04.011
JOE: I'd love to. I think that's what I want to
do.

01:35:04.011 --> 01:35:05.983
MATT: Okay. Then make a stealth check.

01:35:05.983 --> 01:35:08.512
LAURA: If you're within 30 feet of me, you still
get plus ten.

01:35:08.512 --> 01:35:11.766
MATT: You would not be within 30 feet of her once
she enters the building. So.

01:35:11.766 --> 01:35:17.306
MARISHA: Can you do the cool John Wayne thing, and
go underneath of him, and hang on his belly from

01:35:17.306 --> 01:35:18.308
the saddle?

01:35:18.308 --> 01:35:19.426
JOE: Yeah. That's what I'm trying to do.

01:35:19.426 --> 01:35:20.700
MATT: Make an athletics check.

01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:29.858
JOE: 28.

01:35:29.858 --> 01:35:38.567
MATT: As this happens, you immediately climb down
to the underbelly of the gloomstalker. To maintain

01:35:38.567 --> 01:35:41.797
hold on it, because its physical form-- and it's
interesting, now that you've been this close to

01:35:41.797 --> 01:35:44.715
it, and you've been wrestling it, you feel it's
partially corporeal. There's something about its

01:35:44.715 --> 01:35:52.805
physicality that is almost gelatinous. Like it's
made up of a combination of shadow and physical

01:35:52.805 --> 01:36:00.092
will. And as you clutch into it, your fingers dig
and begin to seep into it, almost like a cluster

01:36:00.092 --> 01:36:05.698
of tar. But it holds you fast, and you're there
underneath. Make a stealth check, without

01:36:05.698 --> 01:36:07.445
disadvantage, but this will--

01:36:07.445 --> 01:36:11.642
LAURA: Is it a boy or a girl gloomstalker?

01:36:11.642 --> 01:36:14.394
JOE: I'm close enough to know.

01:36:14.394 --> 01:36:19.551
MATT: Gloomstalkers are actually sexless. They
have no natural--

01:36:19.551 --> 01:36:21.958
JOE: (whispers) It seems to be asexual. Oh, do I
have a little--?

01:36:21.958 --> 01:36:23.147
MATT: You do not.

01:36:23.147 --> 01:36:24.370
JOE: (groans)

01:36:24.370 --> 01:36:30.334
LAURA: Oh no.

01:36:30.334 --> 01:36:33.407
JOE: This is going to be an 11.

01:36:33.407 --> 01:36:35.235
MATT: Okay. Good to know. The rest of you guys?

01:36:35.235 --> 01:36:38.119
JOE: That was a shitty roll.

01:36:38.119 --> 01:36:39.219
TRAVIS: Oh, 16. No, 18.

01:36:39.219 --> 01:36:40.239
LAURA: Add ten.

01:36:40.239 --> 01:36:41.180
TRAVIS: I did.

01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:42.231
ASHLEY: 22.

01:36:42.231 --> 01:36:43.436
LAURA: 33.

01:36:43.436 --> 01:36:44.509
LIAM: 46.

01:36:44.509 --> 01:36:45.548
MARISHA: 27.

01:36:45.548 --> 01:36:46.495
TALIESIN: 30.

01:36:46.495 --> 01:36:47.575
SAM: 19 and 30.

01:36:47.575 --> 01:36:48.465
MATT: Okay.

01:36:48.465 --> 01:36:50.493
LAURA: No, 43.

01:36:50.493 --> 01:36:57.676
MATT: Okay. As you guys all dart into this
building, you all quietly listen outside, as you

01:36:57.676 --> 01:37:06.411
maintain, hovering in place. The skeletal dragon
(croaking) swoops down. As its wings catch itself,

01:37:06.411 --> 01:37:13.828
the wind billows through the space in the center
here. You can see a bunch of the dust and pebbles

01:37:13.828 --> 01:37:18.413
and loose rubble that's been built up around here,
and the wall that was left behind just gets kicked

01:37:18.413 --> 01:37:24.738
up, and spins a brief dust devil in the vicinity.
The skeletal dragon there, still flying. Make a

01:37:24.738 --> 01:37:26.099
perception check.

01:37:26.099 --> 01:37:31.472
LAURA: But we're within 60 feet of him, right? You
said we weren't within 30.

01:37:31.472 --> 01:37:32.803
MATT: He's kept relatively close to the building.

01:37:32.803 --> 01:37:33.803
LAURA: Okay.

01:37:33.803 --> 01:37:34.977
JOE: So I didn't get the plus ten.

01:37:34.977 --> 01:37:35.943
LAURA and MATT: No.

01:37:35.943 --> 01:37:39.540
LAURA: But you're still hidden from view from
Vecna.

01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:43.049
JOE: Perception. That's not terrible. That's a 16
perception.

01:37:43.049 --> 01:37:47.990
MATT: Okay. As soon as the dragon gets close-- and
you've seen it flying about, up in the

01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:54.250
stratosphere area of this dome before-- you can
see there are still bits of flesh dangling off of

01:37:54.250 --> 01:38:00.576
the bones. And it is a familiar-colored flesh.

01:38:00.576 --> 01:38:02.169
LAURA: (gasps)

01:38:02.169 --> 01:38:03.856
TALIESIN and SAM: Oh, no.

01:38:03.856 --> 01:38:12.310
MATT: Whereas you and your adventuring party had
traveled here before, this risen dragon form

01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:17.928
seems to have been torn from the corpse of the
mount that brought you to this city.

01:38:17.928 --> 01:38:20.362
JOE: Oh, no.

01:38:20.362 --> 01:38:27.812
MATT: You see, as the skull of its body, its eyes
crackling bright blue-green energy, there on the

01:38:27.812 --> 01:38:34.049
back of this dragon, you see two humanoids
standing on its back. You see a dark armored male

01:38:34.049 --> 01:38:39.582
with pale skin, with a well-kept beard and short
hair, with his arm around the waist of a female,

01:38:39.582 --> 01:38:42.955
who's currently clutching onto the back of its
bones. You can see the woman, in a red robe that's

01:38:42.955 --> 01:38:48.113
being blown up, her hair bound in the front, wild
behind, as she has a necklace bauble that hangs

01:38:48.113 --> 01:38:52.633
around her neck, crackling blue-green energy. As
she has her hand forward, she glances around at

01:38:52.633 --> 01:39:04.452
the space, angrily. "What!?" (heavy breathing)
Looks over at the gloomstalker. "Oh. What have we

01:39:04.452 --> 01:39:11.497
"here? Is this your doing?"

01:39:11.497 --> 01:39:19.184
SAM: Maybe she doesn't see you. Maybe she's
talking to the gloomstalker.

01:39:19.184 --> 01:39:22.707
JOE: I control the gloomstalker and make him
screech.

01:39:22.707 --> 01:39:31.299
MATT: (screeches) "Adorable. Wouldn't you say so,
honey?" And the man behind her goes, "Oh, quite.

01:39:31.299 --> 01:39:42.441
"Well, I'm a fan of taking thorns out of my side.
Is it time we do a bit of surgery, darling?" And

01:39:42.441 --> 01:39:46.704
the woman goes, "But of course. Oh, how I've
missed you." And she nuzzles into his neck a bit,

01:39:46.704 --> 01:39:54.191
and turns around. The dragon lands onto the tower
across the way, facing in the direction of the

01:39:54.191 --> 01:40:01.384
gloomstalker, and it inhales. And you watch as it
begins to breathe in, all of the shards of bone

01:40:01.384 --> 01:40:06.943
matter that have been scattered across the streets
of the city begin to whip up and spiral into its

01:40:06.943 --> 01:40:15.867
ribcage, like a blender. As it pulls back (roar)
and as the dragon's mouth opens it releases a

01:40:15.867 --> 01:40:22.349
blast of bone shards that arc out in front of you.
You and the gloomstalker, each, I need--

01:40:22.349 --> 01:40:30.554
SAM: Into the earring I say, this is our chance,
we leave him as a distraction and we go. They don't

01:40:30.554 --> 01:40:32.277
know we're here, we can run!

01:40:32.277 --> 01:40:34.651
MATT: You and the gloomstalker make a dexterity
saving throw please.

01:40:34.651 --> 01:40:38.665
LAURA: But here's the thing, we're not going to
have a better chance to get them away from Vecna.

01:40:38.665 --> 01:40:40.928
Should we attack them now?

01:40:40.928 --> 01:40:43.054
TRAVIS: Plus we have one extra ally. Two!

01:40:43.054 --> 01:40:44.798
LAURA: We can attack them now, away from Vecna.

01:40:44.798 --> 01:40:46.036
JOE: You said dex save?

01:40:46.036 --> 01:40:46.960
MATT: Correct.

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:52.980
JOE: I actually have an advantage on dex saves
that I can see.

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:54.361
MATT: There you go.

01:40:54.361 --> 01:40:56.192
MARISHA: Maybe wait for them to land.

01:40:56.192 --> 01:40:58.542
SAM and LAURA: Are they landed?

01:40:58.542 --> 01:40:59.789
SAM: Are they hovering?

01:40:59.789 --> 01:41:02.432
MATT: They've landed on a tower right across from
the building where you guys are.

01:41:02.432 --> 01:41:03.674
LAURA: How far away is that?

01:41:03.674 --> 01:41:05.347
MATT: Let me show you.

01:41:05.347 --> 01:41:08.405
(cheering)

01:41:08.405 --> 01:41:10.464
TRAVIS: (shouting) Oh this is it! Oh no!

01:41:10.464 --> 01:41:13.074
SAM and ASHLEY: (airhorn sounds)

01:41:13.074 --> 01:41:16.509
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:41:16.509 --> 01:41:20.305
MARISHA: So wait, is it Vorugal? Is it Thordak?

01:41:20.305 --> 01:41:22.042
LIAM: No it's &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; mount.

01:41:22.042 --> 01:41:23.797
MARISHA: It's your old mount?

01:41:23.797 --> 01:41:27.522
JOE: I rode in on a white dragon named Obakala.

01:41:27.522 --> 01:41:30.070
(groaning)

01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:33.161
TALIESIN: (shouting) What? No!

01:41:33.161 --> 01:41:36.883
ALL: Ooh.

01:41:36.883 --> 01:41:38.460
LAURA: And they're on this?

01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:40.246
SAM: How did you know we would be here?

01:41:40.246 --> 01:41:43.185
LAURA: How did he know we would be here?

01:41:43.185 --> 01:41:44.847
MATT: I had a few possibilities.

01:41:44.847 --> 01:41:49.949
LAURA: Oh, it's okay, Briarwoods down.

01:41:49.949 --> 01:41:52.493
MARISHA: Bony dragon!

01:41:52.493 --> 01:41:58.107
ASHLEY: They're dead! We did it!

01:41:58.107 --> 01:42:00.732
MATT: If that was the way it went you guys would
have been dead a long time ago.

01:42:00.732 --> 01:42:08.743
MARISHA: Wait, did you put a cool little acrylic
thing on there to make them mountable?

01:42:08.743 --> 01:42:09.920
MATT: I did.

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:11.249
MARISHA: That's pretty dope.

01:42:11.249 --> 01:42:14.472
MATT: Currently riding your gloomstalker.

01:42:14.472 --> 01:42:15.730
JOE: I'm on top of my dude?

01:42:15.730 --> 01:42:16.599
MATT: Yep.

01:42:16.599 --> 01:42:20.272
JOE: Thank you John Paul and everyone at Gale
Force Nine for my sweet-ass mini that just arrived

01:42:20.272 --> 01:42:21.919
from the UK today!

01:42:21.919 --> 01:42:27.452
LAURA: So we're in this building?

01:42:27.452 --> 01:42:31.299
JOE: Well I was kind of on the bottom, but we'll
let it--

01:42:31.299 --> 01:42:35.700
MATT: Yeah well I'm putting it there because that's
the range of the blast right there.

01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:40.091
LAURA: Shit. Maybe he rolled really well on his
dex save.

01:42:40.091 --> 01:42:45.685
MATT: All right, so you guys, let's go ahead and figure
out your placement here. You guys rushed into this

01:42:45.685 --> 01:42:46.883
building here.

01:42:46.883 --> 01:42:47.815
ASHLEY: There's a window.

01:42:47.815 --> 01:42:51.457
LAURA: There's windows! Okay. Oh my god.

01:42:51.457 --> 01:42:55.800
MATT: You guys rushed around and into this side,
so you guys were in the base floor here.

01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:56.902
LAURA: Okay.

01:42:56.902 --> 01:42:58.118
MATT: Where do you want to be?

01:42:58.118 --> 01:43:00.039
LAURA: Can I run upstairs and look in that
window?

01:43:00.039 --> 01:43:02.613
MATT: Sure. So I'll put you at the window there.

01:43:02.613 --> 01:43:03.838
LAURA: Okay.

01:43:03.838 --> 01:43:05.045
MATT: Who else is placed where?

01:43:05.045 --> 01:43:06.371
MARISHA: I'll be downstairs.

01:43:06.371 --> 01:43:08.955
SAM: There's no way to see out downstairs?

01:43:08.955 --> 01:43:11.000
LIAM: There's no windows on this side.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:18.858
SAM: There seems to be some windows on this side,
right?

01:43:18.858 --> 01:43:21.302
MATT: There's a couple of small slits, but they're
facing out this way.

01:43:21.302 --> 01:43:26.022
LIAM: And then would you say we could use the
attic windows? It's up to you.

01:43:26.022 --> 01:43:28.897
MATT: That's more for flavor. There would be no
attic windows. It's been reinforced, so there's

01:43:28.897 --> 01:43:32.947
been placed armor on the bottom, the only windows
that are available are the ones up top and even

01:43:32.947 --> 01:43:34.340
then only have arrow slits.

01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:38.764
ASHLEY: Because we can't see around there, I'm
going to use it as a reference photo.

01:43:38.764 --> 01:43:42.420
MATT: Fair enough. Vax, are you up with your
sister?

01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:43.607
LIAM: Yes I am.

01:43:43.607 --> 01:43:44.716
LAURA: And Trinket is out.

01:43:44.716 --> 01:43:45.987
MATT: All right, so you bamf Trinket out.

01:43:45.987 --> 01:43:48.427
LAURA: I bamf Trinket out but he's down by Grog.

01:43:48.427 --> 01:43:55.350
MATT: Okay, we'll put Grog-- we'll say that you
were probably down in this building being as quiet

01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:58.711
as you can. Percival, Scanlan, Keyleth, Pike.

01:43:58.711 --> 01:44:02.329
ASHLEY: I'm behind my boy Grog. My boy Blue!

01:44:02.329 --> 01:44:03.732
TALIESIN: There's that other window.

01:44:03.732 --> 01:44:05.899
MATT: Up on the second level.

01:44:05.899 --> 01:44:07.063
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:44:07.063 --> 01:44:08.586
MATT: Okay. So we'll put you up there.

01:44:08.586 --> 01:44:17.716
ASHLEY: Guys, do not worry! We have an extra plus
two to our hit points! It's going to be fine!

01:44:17.716 --> 01:44:22.899
TRAVIS: Most amazing 2d10 roll ever.

01:44:22.899 --> 01:44:25.305
MATT: All right, Scanlan.

01:44:25.305 --> 01:44:27.402
SAM: I mean I'm in there somewhere.

01:44:27.402 --> 01:44:28.759
MATT: I need a second Scanlan.

01:44:28.759 --> 01:44:33.207
MARISHA: Is Keyleth up top? Keyleth's up top,
okay.

01:44:33.207 --> 01:44:38.308
SAM: I think I would be near the window where I
could kind of see-- what's your name, Ar-Can?

01:44:38.308 --> 01:44:39.133
JOE: Arkhan.

01:44:39.133 --> 01:44:39.996
SAM: Arkhan?

01:44:39.996 --> 01:44:40.747
JOE: Yeah.

01:44:40.747 --> 01:44:42.246
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this--

01:44:42.246 --> 01:44:45.898
SAM: He can just move with me, it's fine.

01:44:45.898 --> 01:44:47.097
MATT: This will be tiny Scanlan.

01:44:47.097 --> 01:44:47.897
SAM: Sure.

01:44:47.897 --> 01:44:49.102
MATT: Scanlan where are you?

01:44:49.102 --> 01:44:52.980
SAM: Near the downstairs windows where I can
see--

01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:54.593
LAURA: This is so intense!

01:44:54.593 --> 01:44:56.859
MATT: Right here there's small slits, they're all
armored up.

01:44:56.859 --> 01:44:58.669
SAM: Oh they're armored up, all right, so then I'm
upstairs.

01:44:58.669 --> 01:45:03.788
MATT: All right, okay. We'll put that there. So
we'll say for the purposes of this you guys would be--

01:45:03.788 --> 01:45:06.059
LAURA: I can't believe we're fighting the fucking
Briarwoods again!

01:45:06.059 --> 01:45:07.626
TALIESIN: That's going to be fun.

01:45:07.717 --> 01:45:09.115
JOE: That's not the Death Knight?

01:45:09.115 --> 01:45:10.274
MATT: No.

01:45:10.274 --> 01:45:12.211
JOE: It's her dude?

01:45:12.211 --> 01:45:13.698
MATT: Sure. So.

01:45:13.698 --> 01:45:15.401
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's Lord Briarwood.

01:45:15.401 --> 01:45:19.485
MATT: Now that we're set, thank you for your
patience. So what did you roll, you and your

01:45:19.485 --> 01:45:20.681
gloomstalker?

01:45:20.681 --> 01:45:29.297
JOE: Well, me get not-- him not-- it not so good.
I had a 27. Gloomstalker 11. I'm trying to be--

01:45:29.297 --> 01:45:32.577
give the proper gender-specific...

01:45:32.577 --> 01:45:34.358
SAM: They.

01:45:34.358 --> 01:45:35.291
JOE: They?

01:45:35.291 --> 01:45:36.184
SAM: They.

01:45:36.184 --> 01:45:45.712
JOE: Rolled an 11. Well, actually no. Wait, hold
on. They would benefit from my Aura of

01:45:45.712 --> 01:45:46.773
Protection.

01:45:46.773 --> 01:45:47.711
MATT: That's true.

01:45:47.711 --> 01:45:49.800
JOE: So they would have a 15, I would have a 27.

01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:53.767
MATT: That's with their plus six? The gloomstalker
gets a plus six dexterity saving throw.

01:45:53.767 --> 01:45:57.791
JOE: Oh, plus six! I'm looking at the dex modifier
which is plus three.

01:45:57.791 --> 01:46:02.778
MATT: Right. Says under saving throws, dex plus
six. Wait, does it? No, it's dex plus eight.

01:46:02.778 --> 01:46:03.771
Sorry.

01:46:03.771 --> 01:46:04.670
LAURA: Oh shit.

01:46:04.670 --> 01:46:05.489
TRAVIS: Take it.

01:46:05.489 --> 01:46:11.183
JOE: So then, it-- they had a 20. I had a 27.

01:46:11.183 --> 01:46:16.779
MATT: All right. You both succeeded on the save so
you take half damage which is only 26 points of

01:46:16.779 --> 01:46:18.265
necrotic damage.

01:46:18.265 --> 01:46:19.489
TALIESIN: That's solid.

01:46:19.489 --> 01:46:25.809
MATT: Sorry, piercing damage, not necrotic. So as
the bone shards go slamming into each of you, that

01:46:25.809 --> 01:46:28.741
completes the dragon's turn. Now everybody please
roll initiative.

01:46:28.741 --> 01:46:29.944
(groans)

01:46:29.944 --> 01:46:31.400
TRAVIS: Okay. Come on, come get some!

01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:32.833
LAURA: Oh god, oh god, oh god.

01:46:32.833 --> 01:46:36.633
JOE: You said 60, Matt?

01:46:36.633 --> 01:46:39.349
MATT: 26.

01:46:39.349 --> 01:46:42.777
JOE: Yeah, I got that right for there. 26.

01:46:42.777 --> 01:46:46.083
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil!

01:46:46.083 --> 01:46:47.443
JOE: Do I roll for the thing?

01:46:47.443 --> 01:46:50.074
MATT: Yes, you would.

01:46:50.074 --> 01:46:51.305
JOE: Separately of me.

01:46:51.305 --> 01:46:57.546
MATT: Separately. I'll say for the ease of it
let's make it on your turn. There's a lot going on

01:46:57.546 --> 01:46:58.942
here. All righty.

01:46:58.942 --> 01:47:00.905
LAURA: In-game hour, not this game hour.

01:47:00.905 --> 01:47:02.824
MARISHA: Right. No.

01:47:02.824 --> 01:47:05.427
MATT: 25 to 20.

01:47:05.427 --> 01:47:07.727
TRAVIS: Thanks to Kas, 27.

01:47:07.727 --> 01:47:09.661
LAURA: Oh shit. 24 for me.

01:47:09.661 --> 01:47:18.150
MATT: Right. 25 to 20? I just said that, right?

01:47:18.150 --> 01:47:19.492
LAURA: 24.

01:47:19.492 --> 01:47:21.019
MATT: Yeah. 20 to 15?

01:47:21.019 --> 01:47:21.795
TALIESIN: 18.

01:47:21.795 --> 01:47:22.580
JOE: 17.

01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:23.533
MATT: Nice.

01:47:23.533 --> 01:47:25.180
JOE: For me and they.

01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:26.319
TRAVIS: 18, 17?

01:47:26.319 --> 01:47:30.218
MATT: 18, 17?

01:47:30.218 --> 01:47:32.198
JOE: Yes, yep.

01:47:32.198 --> 01:47:34.186
MARISHA: Do you always do this or is this new for
you?

01:47:34.186 --> 01:47:35.251
TRAVIS: I always do this.

01:47:35.251 --> 01:47:37.467
ASHLEY: 15 for Pike.

01:47:37.467 --> 01:47:38.493
MATT: Nice.

01:47:38.493 --> 01:47:40.736
JOE: Is there a cricket in the studio or is that
part of the sound effect?

01:47:40.736 --> 01:47:42.004
MATT: No, that's in the studio.

01:47:42.004 --> 01:47:43.819
TRAVIS: It's just not that intense of a fight.

01:47:43.819 --> 01:47:45.337
MATT: 15 to ten.

01:47:45.337 --> 01:47:46.756
SAM: Ten.

01:47:46.756 --> 01:47:49.113
MARISHA: Yeah, you hear it?

01:47:49.113 --> 01:47:50.314
TRAVIS: Vax, what were you again?

01:47:50.314 --> 01:47:51.355
LAURA: 24.

01:47:51.355 --> 01:47:52.231
MATT: All right.

01:47:52.231 --> 01:47:53.253
TRAVIS: Vax.

01:47:53.253 --> 01:47:55.547
LAURA: You were looking me in the eye when you
said it.

01:47:55.547 --> 01:47:57.745
TALIESIN: Cricket's initiative is sadly 30.

01:47:57.745 --> 01:48:01.241
MATT: Keyleth, what did you get?

01:48:01.241 --> 01:48:02.272
MARISHA: Six.

01:48:02.272 --> 01:48:03.751
SAM: So did Scanlan Two.

01:48:03.751 --> 01:48:07.276
LIAM: Hateful eight.

01:48:07.276 --> 01:48:08.783
JOE: So you roll separate initiatives for you and
Scanlan 2?

01:48:08.783 --> 01:48:10.163
SAM: No, this is new for me. This is new.

01:48:10.163 --> 01:48:14.378
MATT: So is that everybody? I believe that's
everybody.

01:48:14.378 --> 01:48:20.157
SAM: Matt, just manage the ten people and three
creatures on the field right now and you'll be fine.

01:48:20.157 --> 01:48:23.029
MATT: I know. Be good. All right. First up first,
Grog, it's you.

01:48:23.029 --> 01:48:26.853
TRAVIS: It's me. Already raging.

01:48:26.853 --> 01:48:28.419
MATT: Yep, you're already raging.

01:48:28.419 --> 01:48:34.656
TRAVIS: Let's see, there's a window, right? Can I
run upstairs?

01:48:34.656 --> 01:48:42.127
MATT: You are now up with these assholes. Right
there.

01:48:42.127 --> 01:48:44.905
TRAVIS: And I jump out the motherfucking window.

01:48:44.905 --> 01:48:47.463
MATT: That you can. (heavy impact)

01:48:47.463 --> 01:48:50.027
TRAVIS: Is that my full 50?

01:48:50.027 --> 01:48:55.264
MATT: I'd put that at about 35, I'd say. You've
got 15 feet still.

01:48:55.264 --> 01:49:00.352
TRAVIS: Awesome. So I'm going to double dash with
the spider boots that Percy gave me and I'm going

01:49:00.352 --> 01:49:04.644
to run up the tower and just go straight, yeah.

01:49:04.644 --> 01:49:05.776
MATT: Well, one dash.

01:49:05.776 --> 01:49:06.705
TRAVIS: One dash.

01:49:06.705 --> 01:49:09.049
MATT: So you get to the top of the tower and you
are now base to base with the dragon.

01:49:09.049 --> 01:49:14.925
LAURA: Did you just fucking go father than 60 feet
away from me?

01:49:14.925 --> 01:49:17.788
TALIESIN: No. Technically radius-wise--

01:49:17.788 --> 01:49:19.217
MATT: Radius-wise he's close to you still.

01:49:19.217 --> 01:49:20.710
TRAVIS: Yeah, why you making me feel dumb?

01:49:20.710 --> 01:49:26.888
LAURA: Just remember that because it's a thing
during battle. They could, but we don't know. We

01:49:26.888 --> 01:49:28.278
could kill them before he knows.

01:49:28.278 --> 01:49:32.394
JOE: So that means if I get up next to this thing,
I would be in range of this 60 feet?

01:49:32.394 --> 01:49:34.495
LAURA: You are within 60 feet right now.

01:49:34.495 --> 01:49:36.961
SAM: Just do what you do. It's Vex's job to keep
us in radius.

01:49:36.961 --> 01:49:39.317
JOE: What bonus do I have?

01:49:39.317 --> 01:49:42.731
LAURA: That doesn't give you a bonus, it just
keeps Vecna from seeing you.

01:49:42.731 --> 01:49:47.765
TRAVIS: Am I within melee of that skeleton dragon?
The bone dragon?

01:49:47.765 --> 01:49:49.099
MATT: You are within melee of the dragon.

01:49:49.099 --> 01:49:50.491
TRAVIS: Perfect. That's my turn.

01:49:50.491 --> 01:49:52.421
LAURA: The only way we're going to get the drop on
him is if he doesn't actually know we're here.

01:49:52.421 --> 01:49:53.930
SAM: He's going to know we're here. They're going
to tell him.

01:49:53.930 --> 01:49:55.171
LAURA: We're going to kill them.

01:49:55.171 --> 01:49:58.491
TRAVIS: With my bonus action can I make it a
frenzied rage?

01:49:58.491 --> 01:50:01.804
MATT: You may. That's your turn, Grog. Vax, you're
up.

01:50:01.804 --> 01:50:04.573
LIAM: I got an eight. I'm way at the bottom.

01:50:04.573 --> 01:50:06.832
LAURA: I had a 24.

01:50:06.832 --> 01:50:12.948
MATT: All right, so Vex?

01:50:12.948 --> 01:50:14.992
LAURA: Can I lean out the window and attack?

01:50:14.992 --> 01:50:15.984
MATT: You may.

01:50:15.984 --> 01:50:24.342
LAURA: Okay, I lean out the window, and can I see
Delilah? Can I shoot at her?

01:50:24.342 --> 01:50:25.519
MATT: Sure.

01:50:25.519 --> 01:50:31.312
LAURA: With my sharpshooter, she doesn't get any
additional cover or anything. Okay, so I'm going

01:50:31.312 --> 01:50:39.377
to sharpshooter Delilah with one of my needle
arrows that I've been hanging onto for a gajillion

01:50:39.377 --> 01:50:45.377
years. So that is a 25 to hit.

01:50:45.377 --> 01:50:50.602
MATT: 25 to hit? Yeah, even with Shield, she
couldn't stop that. That hits.

01:50:50.602 --> 01:50:55.524
LAURA: Yes! Okay. Good.

01:50:55.524 --> 01:50:57.662
SAM: Is she aiming for the dragon?

01:50:57.662 --> 01:50:58.824
TALIESIN: No, Delilah.

01:50:58.824 --> 01:51:00.582
SAM: Big D.

01:51:00.582 --> 01:51:06.758
LAURA: Is that sneak attack because she didn't
know I was there, technically? Oh, Grog's standing

01:51:06.758 --> 01:51:07.661
right there!

01:51:07.661 --> 01:51:14.388
MATT: Grog's in melee with the dragon. I'll say
because she was not aware of you, they were only

01:51:14.388 --> 01:51:18.954
aware of him, it's sneak attack. It's not a crit;
it's not a surprise attack, but you get sneak

01:51:18.954 --> 01:51:20.033
attack.

01:51:20.033 --> 01:51:24.549
LAURA: (counting) 31.

01:51:24.549 --> 01:51:26.700
MATT: 31. All right, 31 points of damage.

01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:30.157
LAURA: Oh, no, 41 because I was sharpshootering.

01:51:30.157 --> 01:51:31.607
MATT: Okay.

01:51:31.607 --> 01:51:35.595
LAURA: And then that one definitely doesn't hit.

01:51:35.595 --> 01:51:37.957
ASHLEY: But it wasn't in the thing.

01:51:37.957 --> 01:51:39.738
LAURA: I know, but it still was a roll.

01:51:39.738 --> 01:51:41.164
MATT: What is it?

01:51:41.164 --> 01:51:42.231
LAURA: It's 17.

01:51:42.231 --> 01:51:47.818
MATT: 17? Nope, that misses. As you lean through
the window, you release the first arrow, and as

01:51:47.818 --> 01:51:54.145
Delilah's up there, both clutching the necklace
and has her hand out with this wand, you hit her

01:51:54.145 --> 01:51:59.312
hand with the arrow. (snarls) Looks over and looks
down at the window, right towards you, and there's

01:51:59.312 --> 01:52:04.790
a moment of recognition as she sees you. As you
fire the second arrow, she dodges it and goes,

01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:07.359
"I remember you."

01:52:07.359 --> 01:52:11.903
LAURA: (scared noises) I'm going to use my bonus
action to hide.

01:52:11.903 --> 01:52:15.288
MATT: Okay, so you duck off to the side of the
window.

01:52:15.288 --> 01:52:21.963
LAURA: Not that it matters, but I'm going to roll
for stealth. That did nothing. 21? Nope, 31,

01:52:21.963 --> 01:52:23.409
because I still haven't cast Hunter's Mark.

01:52:23.409 --> 01:52:28.777
MATT: Okay. Good to know. All right, that ends
your turn. With that, it is now Delilah's turn.

01:52:28.777 --> 01:52:32.303
She rolled a 19 for initiative.

01:52:32.303 --> 01:52:37.030
LAURA: Okay, so it's Grog, Vex, Delilah.

01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:41.453
TRAVIS: I don't know where Vax is. I forgot his
number.

01:52:41.453 --> 01:52:43.990
LAURA: He's eight. Percy what?

01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:45.870
TRAVIS: Percy, Arkhan, Pike.

01:52:45.870 --> 01:52:49.049
JOE: It's &lt;i&gt;Arkhan&lt;/i&gt;.

01:52:49.049 --> 01:52:52.852
TRAVIS: I get all names wrong.

01:52:52.852 --> 01:53:03.758
MATT: All right, she is going to point her finger
down at the wall where all of you guys are, and a

01:53:03.758 --> 01:53:06.855
thin green ray streaks out from her finger.

01:53:06.855 --> 01:53:08.720
LAURA: She's disintegrating the wall?

01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:10.183
MATT: Seems to be.

01:53:10.183 --> 01:53:12.852
JOE: I don't like the phone.

01:53:12.852 --> 01:53:17.531
TRAVIS: I know. When there are too many dice to
roll, the phone comes out.

01:53:17.531 --> 01:53:18.849
LAURA: Oh no.

01:53:18.849 --> 01:53:20.293
MATT: I'm just confirming.

01:53:20.293 --> 01:53:26.714
TRAVIS: The deliverance of the death? The method
chosen?

01:53:26.714 --> 01:53:32.326
MATT: The size of the space that it can
disintegrate. There we go.

01:53:32.326 --> 01:53:34.968
TRAVIS: We've got a dragonborn paladin. We're
fine.

01:53:34.968 --> 01:53:41.153
LIAM: Could you ring up Tiamat and have her help
with this dragon thing?

01:53:41.153 --> 01:53:48.674
MATT: This entire wall right here.

01:53:48.674 --> 01:53:54.057
LAURA: That's true; you could turn the whole
thing.

01:53:54.057 --> 01:54:01.180
MATT: This entire wall is disintegrated in place
and now reveals entirely Vex and Vax.

01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:02.663
LAURA: I'm like--

01:54:02.663 --> 01:54:10.071
MATT: As she pulls her finger back and the wall
turns to dust around you, you hear her say, "I'm

01:54:10.071 --> 01:54:11.893
"sorry, honey, but no."

01:54:11.893 --> 01:54:15.278
LAURA: Oh, hello there. I didn't see you.

01:54:15.278 --> 01:54:17.471
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Oh, hello!

01:54:17.471 --> 01:54:25.228
MATT: It is now the dragon's turn. Let's see if it
gets its breath attack. It does regenerate. The

01:54:25.228 --> 01:54:29.500
dragon (wingbeats). You get an attack of
opportunity.

01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:32.236
TRAVIS: I'll make it reckless.

01:54:32.236 --> 01:54:38.736
MATT: I should have put tape on the bottom of
them. That's my fault.

01:54:38.736 --> 01:54:40.319
SAM: We have tape. We could get tape.

01:54:40.319 --> 01:54:43.284
MARISHA: Is there gaff tape in the house?

01:54:43.284 --> 01:54:46.099
LAURA: Man, I really wish we had some tape right
now!

01:54:46.099 --> 01:54:48.501
MARISHA: I know there's a row of it back there.

01:54:48.501 --> 01:54:51.125
JOE: Dear Tiamat: Send tape.

01:54:51.125 --> 01:54:53.216
LAURA: Did you get the attack?

01:54:53.216 --> 01:54:58.853
JOE: Dear Tiamat: It's Arkhan. We need Scotch
tape.

01:54:58.853 --> 01:55:01.242
TRAVIS: I believe it's &lt;i&gt;Arkhan.&lt;/i&gt;

01:55:01.242 --> 01:55:05.076
MATT: As the dragon (wingbeats), you get an attack
of opportunity on the dragon.

01:55:05.076 --> 01:55:06.353
TRAVIS: It's a 34.

01:55:06.353 --> 01:55:07.501
MATT: 34? That hits!

01:55:07.501 --> 01:55:09.435
MARISHA: Yeah, get that roll of gaffer tape.

01:55:09.435 --> 01:55:10.908
MATT: Thank you kindly, Mr. Brian Foster.

01:55:10.908 --> 01:55:13.315
MARISHA: (mispronouncing) Brian Foster.

01:55:13.315 --> 01:55:15.978
BRIAN: It's a janitor's keyring of tape.

01:55:15.978 --> 01:55:19.923
LAURA: Use the gaff tape. It's the best.

01:55:19.923 --> 01:55:22.350
JOE: This thing is on the ground now?

01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:27.596
MATT: It is hovering right above the ground. It's
trying to get down into the space of the wall

01:55:27.596 --> 01:55:34.405
that's currently exposed. Please pass the tape
over here? Okay. How much damage is that, Grog?

01:55:34.405 --> 01:55:37.144
TRAVIS: This dragon would be considered undead,
yes?

01:55:37.144 --> 01:55:38.125
MATT: Yes.

01:55:38.125 --> 01:55:43.463
TRAVIS: So with the sword's 2d10 slashing damage
to undead, that's 32 points of damage.

01:55:43.463 --> 01:55:49.885
MATT: 32 points of damage to the dragon. Nice. So
as it swoops up, the dragon takes one arc with the

01:55:49.885 --> 01:55:53.185
blade, and as it streaks across, it slams into
part of its foot, and you watch as the bone

01:55:53.185 --> 01:55:59.806
splinters upon impact with the Sword of Kas. As
the dragon lands, it brings its head down into the

01:55:59.806 --> 01:56:07.198
gap where the opening is and arches forward. As it
does, it fills the entirety of the space. It

01:56:07.198 --> 01:56:12.583
inhales a second time. You watch as all the bits
of bone spiral up into it. It regenerated for the

01:56:12.583 --> 01:56:14.121
second time.

01:56:14.121 --> 01:56:17.834
SAM: Is this an attack roll that it's about to
make?

01:56:17.834 --> 01:56:24.743
MATT: No, it's a saving throw on you guys' part.
As it releases this torrent of bone shards and

01:56:24.743 --> 01:56:29.177
rock and whatever it can pull up into its chest
and releases it, I need everybody in that room:

01:56:29.177 --> 01:56:32.609
both Scanlans, Keyleth, Percival--

01:56:32.609 --> 01:56:34.002
TALIESIN: Do I not have cover?

01:56:34.002 --> 01:56:37.206
MATT: Cover's not going to help you on this,
unfortunately. It fills the whole space.

01:56:37.206 --> 01:56:39.418
JOE: Should've rode in on a horse.

01:56:39.418 --> 01:56:41.464
MARISHA: What are we making? Dex saves?

01:56:41.464 --> 01:56:43.153
MATT: Dexterity saving throws, guys.

01:56:43.153 --> 01:56:46.029
MARISHA: This doesn't give us spell resist,
right?

01:56:46.029 --> 01:56:50.081
SAM: Scanlan Two is going to use Cutting Words to
reduce the damage.

01:56:50.081 --> 01:56:51.125
MATT: Okay.

01:56:51.125 --> 01:56:52.401
MARISHA: That's all right. That's good.

01:56:52.401 --> 01:56:56.822
SAM: Dex?

01:56:56.822 --> 01:57:04.045
MATT: All right.

01:57:04.045 --> 01:57:07.213
SAM: Scanlan One: 18. Scanlan Two: 25.

01:57:07.213 --> 01:57:08.755
MATT: Both succeed. 18, barely.

01:57:08.755 --> 01:57:09.600
TALIESIN: 18.

01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:10.497
MATT: Succeeds.

01:57:10.497 --> 01:57:11.258
MARISHA: 17.

01:57:11.258 --> 01:57:12.274
MATT: Barely missed it.

01:57:12.274 --> 01:57:15.137
LIAM: 26. Evasion means zero.

01:57:15.137 --> 01:57:16.530
LAURA: 31.

01:57:16.530 --> 01:57:24.741
MATT: 31 succeeds. All righty. The only person to
take full damage on this is Keyleth, right? Sorry.

01:57:24.741 --> 01:57:27.710
Double-checking on the bard ability Cutting
Words.

01:57:27.710 --> 01:57:33.225
SAM: Can reduce damage by d12.

01:57:33.225 --> 01:57:34.824
MATT: Roll a d12.

01:57:34.824 --> 01:57:36.405
LAURA: On all of us?

01:57:36.405 --> 01:57:38.340
SAM: Five. Five less.

01:57:38.340 --> 01:57:39.523
LAURA: That's good.

01:57:39.523 --> 01:57:44.512
MATT: That is 49 points of piercing damage to you,
Keyleth.

01:57:44.512 --> 01:57:45.827
MARISHA: 49!

01:57:45.827 --> 01:57:50.483
MATT: The rest of you take 24.

01:57:50.483 --> 01:57:52.465
LAURA: That's minus the five?

01:57:52.465 --> 01:57:54.473
MATT: Yes.

01:57:54.473 --> 01:57:59.730
MARISHA: Minus 49? I'm at 94.

01:57:59.730 --> 01:58:05.599
MATT: It fills the space there, and you feel every
ounce of exposed skin and flesh has been hit with

01:58:05.599 --> 01:58:09.330
a thousand needles. That ends its turn. Percival,
you're up.

01:58:09.330 --> 01:58:19.447
TALIESIN: So I can gather my wits, there's an
angry Delilah with a wand, clutching a weird thing

01:58:19.447 --> 01:58:24.653
around her neck. There's a Sylas with what I
assume would be a brand new sword.

01:58:24.653 --> 01:58:25.988
MATT: Probably.

01:58:25.988 --> 01:58:29.673
TALIESIN: And they're sitting about how many feet
up on a dragon right now?

01:58:29.673 --> 01:58:32.176
MATT: I'd say about 15 feet.

01:58:32.176 --> 01:58:35.892
TALIESIN: Let's have a little fun.

01:58:35.892 --> 01:58:38.991
ASHLEY: Let's have a little fun.

01:58:38.991 --> 01:58:46.098
TALIESIN: All right. Oh, good, and I have an
escape route. That'll do really nicely. This is

01:58:46.098 --> 01:58:50.591
going to be fun. I'm going to Bugs Bunny this
lady. First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

01:58:50.591 --> 01:58:52.088
take a shot--

01:58:52.088 --> 01:58:53.509
MARISHA: Don't look down.

01:58:53.509 --> 01:58:55.235
TALIESIN: Why?

01:58:55.235 --> 01:58:56.556
MARISHA: Never mind.

01:58:56.556 --> 01:59:02.359
TALIESIN: Oh, no. That was good. It took me a
second. I'm going to take a shot with Animus. Boy,

01:59:02.359 --> 01:59:06.052
I'm nervous. I'm going to burn a point of grit,
and I'm going to make her drop her wand.

01:59:06.052 --> 01:59:08.015
TRAVIS: You've got this. Focus in. You got it.

01:59:08.015 --> 01:59:09.438
MATT: Roll for the attack.

01:59:09.438 --> 01:59:11.987
TRAVIS: Walk in the park.

01:59:11.987 --> 01:59:15.272
TALIESIN: That's a 31 to hit.

01:59:15.272 --> 01:59:16.525
MATT: That'll hit.

01:59:16.525 --> 01:59:20.903
TALIESIN: Let's make her drop stuff. It's a
strength saving throw.

01:59:20.903 --> 01:59:29.064
MATT: Natural five. So as she's holding the wand
out with the hand, (gunshot, grunts). She glances

01:59:29.064 --> 01:59:35.549
back, and as the smoking gun is there, she goes,
"I certainly remember you."

01:59:35.549 --> 01:59:39.717
TALIESIN: I missed you, too, darling. I still do
damage on that one, I believe.

01:59:39.717 --> 01:59:46.077
MATT: Her hand is now covered in blood, and you
can see one of the fingers looks heavily damaged.

01:59:46.077 --> 01:59:55.265
LIAM: Grog does not count in melee of the
dracolich, right? It's just toys.

01:59:55.265 --> 01:59:56.591
MATT: Grog is not in melee.

01:59:56.591 --> 01:59:59.060
TALIESIN: That's nine points of damage, plus five
points of psychic, so 14.

01:59:59.060 --> 02:00:00.580
MATT: Okay. 14 points. Got it.

02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:13.927
TALIESIN: For my next trick, I'm going to burn
another point of grit. Let's push Sylas ten feet.

02:00:13.927 --> 02:00:23.189
Another 31 to hit.

02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:24.337
MATT: That hits.

02:00:24.337 --> 02:00:30.699
TALIESIN: So let's take a little damage and do
a little psychic. I do not like this die, I'm

02:00:30.759 --> 02:00:35.886
getting rid of it. It's only nine points of damage
plus two points of psychic.

02:00:35.886 --> 02:00:37.560
MATT: So 11 to Sylas.

02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:42.240
TALIESIN: So now Sylas has to move ten feet back.

02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:43.777
MATT: No save right?

02:00:43.777 --> 02:00:44.847
TALIESIN: No save.

02:00:44.847 --> 02:00:47.357
MATT: He gets blasted off the back of the dragon.

02:00:47.357 --> 02:00:49.072
ALL: Yes!

02:00:49.072 --> 02:00:50.484
TALIESIN: (Woody Woodpecker laugh)

02:00:50.484 --> 02:00:53.408
TRAVIS: I thought it was Bugs Bunny, but you did
Woody Woodpecker.

02:00:53.408 --> 02:00:56.801
TALIESIN: Woody Woodpecker certainly has more
shade.

02:00:56.801 --> 02:01:01.327
JOE: Is this creature under control to the point
where someone takes damage and has to make a

02:01:01.327 --> 02:01:02.844
control save?

02:01:02.844 --> 02:01:04.121
TALIESIN: We don't know.

02:01:04.121 --> 02:01:05.545
MARISHA: I mean if it used to be yours--

02:01:05.545 --> 02:01:06.885
JOE: It was mine.

02:01:06.885 --> 02:01:07.988
MARISHA: I don't know.

02:01:07.988 --> 02:01:10.272
JOE: But it's not anymore.

02:01:10.272 --> 02:01:11.677
LAURA: Now it's dead.

02:01:11.677 --> 02:01:13.906
ASHLEY: Maybe you can try to get through to it.

02:01:13.906 --> 02:01:18.485
MATT: So he gets blown off and lands prone on the
ground.

02:01:18.485 --> 02:01:33.678
TALIESIN: For my next one, let's push Delilah ten
feet for my final trick. That's a 28 to hit.

02:01:33.678 --> 02:01:35.503
MATT: Shit, that hits.

02:01:35.503 --> 02:01:49.254
TALIESIN: Sorry, man. It's my best trick and I
burned a lot of it. 15 points of damage plus four

02:01:49.254 --> 02:01:58.039
points of psychic plus ten feet. Take some fall
damage.

02:01:58.039 --> 02:02:00.644
MATT: Put her behind the dragon. Actually both
should be behind the dragon.

02:02:00.644 --> 02:02:03.907
LAURA: Did they take damage from falling?

02:02:03.907 --> 02:02:12.141
MATT: They did. They both took 2d6 each, five
points of bludgeoning damage each.

02:02:12.141 --> 02:02:23.689
TALIESIN: So for the rest of it I'm going to use a
bonus action to run a heal. I'm going to give

02:02:23.689 --> 02:02:41.404
myself 19 points back. I'm going to run
downstairs. I'm heading towards that back door.

02:02:41.404 --> 02:02:47.119
MATT: That ends your turn, Percival. Arkhan,
you're up.

02:02:47.119 --> 02:02:49.099
JOE: I would like to rage.

02:02:49.099 --> 02:02:51.658
TRAVIS: Did you rage?

02:02:51.658 --> 02:02:53.042
JOE: Yes!

02:02:53.042 --> 02:02:57.026
(cheering)

02:02:57.026 --> 02:02:59.154
LIAM: Sorry audio team.

02:02:59.154 --> 02:03:03.274
SAM: The testosterone in his group just went from
a half to one.

02:03:03.274 --> 02:03:05.328
MATT: Did you say you went into a frenzied rage
earlier?

02:03:05.328 --> 02:03:06.440
TRAVIS: I did.

02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:07.458
MATT: Okay.

02:03:07.458 --> 02:03:15.536
JOE: Now, question. If I fly past the dragon to
Delilah do I give the dragon an attack of

02:03:15.536 --> 02:03:16.715
opportunity?

02:03:16.715 --> 02:03:18.468
MATT: Yes, you would.

02:03:18.468 --> 02:03:26.208
JOE: I have to go through this thing. I'm going to
fly the gloomstalker right up to this thing.

02:03:26.208 --> 02:03:39.995
Gloomstalker pulls into range and it
makes two attacks on the undead Obakala.

02:03:39.995 --> 02:03:41.888
MATT: Go for it.

02:03:41.888 --> 02:03:58.016
JOE: Oh, terrible. Actually terrible. That's
terrible. So that's going to be a 13 and natural one.

02:03:58.016 --> 02:04:02.613
MATT: Both miss, unfortunately. Its claws streak
out in front of it and unfortunately scrape

02:04:02.613 --> 02:04:05.685
against the bone to no effect. But you have your
turn.

02:04:05.685 --> 02:04:07.127
JOE: Now it's me.

02:04:07.127 --> 02:04:09.167
LAURA: That's an awesome-- Is that your Wyrmwood
box?

02:04:09.167 --> 02:04:15.817
JOE: This is mine, yes. They do those specials.
Those one of a kinds that you can buy.

02:04:15.817 --> 02:04:17.246
LAURA: Oh, oh well.

02:04:17.246 --> 02:04:20.605
(laughter)

02:04:20.605 --> 02:04:22.169
TALIESIN: Next campaign.

02:04:22.169 --> 02:04:23.934
ASHLEY: I have an idea.

02:04:23.934 --> 02:04:31.861
JOE: So I get advantage on my attacks because
I'm raging. This is the first time I've ever raged.

02:04:31.861 --> 02:04:34.221
MATT: If you're going reckless attacks you can.

02:04:34.221 --> 02:04:35.830
JOE: Reckless frenzied rage.

02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:38.049
MATT: Then yes you can.

02:04:38.049 --> 02:04:39.466
JOE: Yes. Okay, great.

02:04:39.466 --> 02:04:43.257
MATT: You're going frenzied rage as opposed to
regular rage?

02:04:43.257 --> 02:04:44.921
JOE: Frenzied does-- Yes.

02:04:44.921 --> 02:04:46.237
TRAVIS: You have to hold it.

02:04:46.237 --> 02:04:48.321
JOE: Hold? Oh because I'm not.

02:04:48.321 --> 02:04:51.407
MATT: He used his bonus action to rage.

02:04:51.407 --> 02:04:54.758
JOE: I used the bonus to rage in the first place.

02:04:54.758 --> 02:04:55.763
MATT: Right.

02:04:55.763 --> 02:05:02.934
JOE: Great! That first one is going to be a 33 to
hit.

02:05:02.934 --> 02:05:04.215
MATT: That hits.

02:05:04.215 --> 02:05:05.607
ASHLEY: Yes!

02:05:05.607 --> 02:05:07.540
JOE: And this thing is undead?

02:05:07.540 --> 02:05:08.388
MATT: Correct.

02:05:08.388 --> 02:05:10.185
LAURA: Yas, Queen Tiamat!

02:05:10.185 --> 02:05:19.863
JOE: I'm going to pump a 3rd-level Divine Smite
into it. Which is-- bear with me, now.

02:05:19.863 --> 02:05:22.893
TRAVIS: We don't do math fast ever.

02:05:22.893 --> 02:05:32.957
JOE: 2d8 for the axe. 2d8 for 1st-level
Divine Smite. Three more for--

02:05:32.957 --> 02:05:36.401
MATT: 2nd, 3rd-level and undead. Correct.

02:05:36.401 --> 02:05:38.408
ASHLEY: All of it!

02:05:38.408 --> 02:05:39.542
TRAVIS: Dump it, dude.

02:05:39.542 --> 02:05:40.752
LIAM: Unload.

02:05:40.752 --> 02:05:42.402
JOE: So that's seven.

02:05:42.402 --> 02:05:58.328
SAM: Math!

02:05:58.328 --> 02:06:02.409
(laughter)

02:06:02.409 --> 02:06:09.874
JOE: It's going to be 49.

02:06:09.874 --> 02:06:16.087
MATT: 49 points of damage on the first hit. So as
you rush up and the Gloomstalker is scratching

02:06:16.087 --> 02:06:22.583
towards it, you rush with a giant arc. You watch
as Fane-Eater's blade springs forth these darkened

02:06:22.583 --> 02:06:27.562
spray of colors, red, green, black. Every
chromatic dragon's power thrust into the blade as

02:06:27.562 --> 02:06:34.078
you slam it into the undead dragon. Watching bones
splinter and break from the blast of dark energy.

02:06:34.078 --> 02:06:35.963
JOE: Love it. Second attack.

02:06:35.963 --> 02:06:37.456
MATT: Go for it.

02:06:37.456 --> 02:06:45.644
JOE: That's a good one too. That's going to be 29.
Same thing, 3rd-level Divine Smite, 7d8.

02:06:45.644 --> 02:06:57.355
(counting) 47.

02:06:57.355 --> 02:07:00.539
LAURA: Kill that dragon.

02:07:00.539 --> 02:07:09.085
MATT: As you pull the axe back you arc a secondary
time. This time with the sound of a union of four

02:07:09.085 --> 02:07:14.845
different dragon cries, the fifth one being your
own. As you slam the axe a second time, hitting

02:07:14.845 --> 02:07:19.865
the edge of its clavicle, it carves through and
breaks. You can see part of the bones shatter and

02:07:19.865 --> 02:07:25.602
reform but still broken and not in the same way.
It's a serious round.

02:07:25.602 --> 02:07:32.027
JOE: Just a hint, a tiny hint, of remorse for
having to kill this thing that I helped raise.

02:07:32.027 --> 02:07:33.831
ALL: Aw.

02:07:33.831 --> 02:07:35.998
LAURA: That'd be like if I had to fight undead
Trinket.

02:07:35.998 --> 02:07:40.229
TRAVIS: Legendary action incoming.

02:07:40.229 --> 02:07:44.628
MATT: Sylas Briarwood is going to move his speed.
Would you hand me Sylas, please?

02:07:44.628 --> 02:07:46.640
TALIESIN: He's prone.

02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:51.996
MATT: He's prone, so has half it. He moves
through. He gets partway through the dragon,

02:07:51.996 --> 02:07:57.192
we'll say. So he's about there. That ends your
turn?

02:07:57.192 --> 02:07:59.068
MARISHA: Sylas is up and moving?

02:07:59.068 --> 02:08:00.410
TALIESIN: Sylas is up and moving.

02:08:00.410 --> 02:08:01.784
MATT: End of your turn?

02:08:01.784 --> 02:08:03.668
JOE: That's all I got.

02:08:03.668 --> 02:08:10.711
MATT: All right. Sylas' turn. Sylas, seeing you
come up and destroy the dragon, grins, climbs up

02:08:10.711 --> 02:08:19.651
the side of the dragon, jumps onto its thigh and
jumps in the air towards you, holding a giant

02:08:19.651 --> 02:08:31.745
blackened greataxe in his hand. (groans) He's
going to go ahead and make a strike at you. Oh, you

02:08:31.745 --> 02:08:38.767
know what? No. He's not going to. Sylas instead,
axe in one hand, grabs the side of the skeletal

02:08:38.767 --> 02:08:47.180
ribcage, hanging off, looks up at you. "You seem
rather strong." And looks you dead in the eyes. I

02:08:47.180 --> 02:08:48.587
need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

02:08:48.587 --> 02:08:50.978
LAURA: No! Oh my god no! Do not get turned!

02:08:50.978 --> 02:08:53.120
TRAVIS: Does he have advantage on wisdom
something?

02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:55.514
LAURA: No, he doesn't because he didn't have the
feast.

02:08:55.514 --> 02:08:56.910
SAM: Can I Cutting Words?

02:08:56.910 --> 02:08:58.561
MATT: You already used your reaction, buddy.

02:08:58.561 --> 02:08:59.813
SAM: One of us has.

02:08:59.813 --> 02:09:01.091
MATT: It's true.

02:09:01.091 --> 02:09:05.893
SAM: Scanlan Prime steps up.

02:09:05.893 --> 02:09:09.937
MATT: Cutting Words only-- You can't give a bonus
to somebody's saving throw.

02:09:09.937 --> 02:09:11.543
SAM: Okay, then never mind.

02:09:11.543 --> 02:09:13.766
MATT: You can reduce an enemy's saving throw.

02:09:13.766 --> 02:09:15.049
SAM: Got it.

02:09:15.049 --> 02:09:17.024
MATT: Through Mythcarver.

02:09:17.024 --> 02:09:23.957
JOE: Straight up roll. Here we go. Natural 20!

02:09:23.957 --> 02:09:25.840
(screaming)

02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:31.818
MATT: Oh shit.

02:09:31.818 --> 02:09:33.805
TRAVIS: In the clutch.

02:09:33.805 --> 02:09:41.821
JOE: I stare him right in the eyes. What would
have happened?

02:09:41.821 --> 02:09:46.547
MATT: He would've charmed you and you would've had
to start fighting them.

02:09:46.547 --> 02:09:48.035
TRAVIS and MARISHA: No!

02:09:48.035 --> 02:09:56.574
MATT: As he stares at you, you feel this cold
presence consume the back of your mind. And you

02:09:56.574 --> 02:10:02.427
feel drawn to him. It's this force of charisma and
drive, and as you begin to lean forward towards it

02:10:02.427 --> 02:10:07.019
you feel this (thump) in your holy symbol and as
you glance you break the gaze for a second and

02:10:07.019 --> 02:10:11.865
look down. And you see the multi-colored fury of
Tiamat reach up and block and obscure the vision

02:10:11.865 --> 02:10:15.480
from him. And as the flames burn off you look up
and the presence is gone. And he looks at you with

02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:17.880
a frustrated glance.

02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:23.537
JOE: Yes! Rage!

02:10:23.537 --> 02:10:35.570
MATT: He's going to use the rest of his movement
to dart back around the side of the tower.

02:10:35.570 --> 02:10:38.261
TALIESIN: How much movement does he have left?

02:10:38.261 --> 02:10:43.299
MATT: He used a legendary action to get up and get
his movement, then on his turn he got his

02:10:43.299 --> 02:10:44.284
movement.

02:10:44.284 --> 02:10:48.100
TALIESIN: All right. No, that's a good 
use of a legendary action.

02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:50.048
MATT: That brings us to Pike.

02:10:50.048 --> 02:10:58.354
ASHLEY: Can I get upstairs? Stay hidden somewhere's
enough?

02:10:58.354 --> 02:11:01.774
MATT: Sure. You get to about where the twins are.

02:11:01.774 --> 02:11:19.351
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope. Choose
everyone that I see.

02:11:19.351 --> 02:11:23.258
MATT: Everyone within 30 feet that you can see gets
affected. That you can see, does it say?

02:11:23.323 --> 02:11:27.063
ASHLEY: Choose any number of creatures within
range.

02:11:27.063 --> 02:11:28.476
MATT: Which is 30 feet?

02:11:28.476 --> 02:11:29.500
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:30.959
MATT: You'd be able to see Percival down there.

02:11:30.959 --> 02:11:32.228
ASHLEY: I can see Grog.

02:11:32.228 --> 02:11:34.391
MATT: Grog is farther than 30 feet.

02:11:34.391 --> 02:11:37.046
LAURA: Can you see Arkhan?

02:11:37.046 --> 02:11:37.816
MATT: Yeah.

02:11:37.816 --> 02:11:39.017
LAURA: Okay, good.

02:11:39.017 --> 02:11:42.890
MATT: Arkhan's in direct vision.

02:11:42.890 --> 02:11:44.475
LAURA: What does this do, again?

02:11:44.475 --> 02:11:52.539
ASHLEY: You have advantage on wisdom saving throws
and death saving throws. I'm also, as a bonus

02:11:52.539 --> 02:11:56.160
action, going to cast Sanctuary on Vex.

02:11:56.160 --> 02:12:00.486
MATT: Sanctuary is a bonus action?

02:12:00.486 --> 02:12:01.899
ASHLEY: It's a bonus action.

02:12:01.899 --> 02:12:08.331
LAURA: What does that do? Okay, okay.

02:12:08.331 --> 02:12:12.646
MATT: Sanctuary means that if something tries to
attack you it has to make a wisdom saving throw to

02:12:12.646 --> 02:12:13.819
see if it does so or not.

02:12:13.819 --> 02:12:15.665
TRAVIS: It's what Earthbreaker did.

02:12:15.665 --> 02:12:19.533
MATT: End your turn, Pike?

02:12:19.533 --> 02:12:33.291
ASHLEY: Am I able to get hidden around the wall?

02:12:33.291 --> 02:12:39.659
MATT: Your movement would've gotten you just up to the
stairs at that point because you had to climb up

02:12:39.659 --> 02:12:54.282
it. At the end of that turn, swooping down, you
hear two impacts on the roof above you. You hear

02:12:54.282 --> 02:13:02.319
the growling, tearing sound as the long dry rotten
wooden rooftops that are above you guy get pulled

02:13:02.319 --> 02:13:06.666
open by two gloomstalkers that've joined the fray.

02:13:06.666 --> 02:13:08.147
TRAVIS: Toothless?

02:13:08.147 --> 02:13:10.871
TALIESIN: Do they count as undead?

02:13:10.871 --> 02:13:13.603
MATT: They do not count as undead.

02:13:13.603 --> 02:13:15.300
ASHLEY: Is the roof off of it?

02:13:15.300 --> 02:13:21.130
MATT: Now the roof is open. Its damaged bits and
parts of it are fallen inward. You guys can move

02:13:21.130 --> 02:13:24.596
around but they have visual on you, but that's all
they can do this turn. It took their full movement

02:13:24.596 --> 02:13:29.220
and action to break in. That's going to end their
turn. Scanlan, you're up. Scanlan One.

02:13:29.220 --> 02:13:33.836
SAM: Scanlan One turns to Scanlan Two and sings a
Song of Healing.

02:13:33.836 --> 02:13:36.867
MATT: Scanlan Two as in the--

02:13:36.867 --> 02:13:39.969
TRAVIS: Which one are you? Prime or Two?

02:13:39.969 --> 02:13:43.813
SAM: I'm Prime right now.

02:13:43.813 --> 02:13:46.278
MATT: A simulacrum can not be healed, except by--

02:13:46.278 --> 02:13:47.270
SAM: &lt;i&gt;Ever?&lt;/i&gt;

02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:48.467
MATT: They can be repaired.

02:13:48.467 --> 02:13:53.000
SAM: But not healed with a healing thing.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:54.089
MATT: Correct.

02:13:54.089 --> 02:13:54.978
SAM: Or a potion.

02:13:54.978 --> 02:13:55.849
MATT: Correct.

02:13:55.849 --> 02:13:58.841
LAURA: How do they get repaired? Is it like a Doty
situation?

02:13:58.841 --> 02:14:00.014
MATT: Kind of.

02:14:00.014 --> 02:14:01.451
ASHLEY: Once they're gone they're gone?

02:14:01.451 --> 02:14:02.224
MATT: Yep.

02:14:02.224 --> 02:14:04.877
SAM: Then never mind that.

02:14:04.877 --> 02:14:12.099
MATT: You would know this, having known the spell
and the significance of its creation. If it is

02:14:12.099 --> 02:14:16.529
damaged you can repair it in an alchemical
laboratory using rare herbs and minerals worth a

02:14:16.529 --> 02:14:17.903
hundred gold per hit point.

02:14:17.903 --> 02:14:19.207
SAM: Oh boy.

02:14:19.207 --> 02:14:22.860
TALIESIN: Can Scanlan Two heal himself?

02:14:22.860 --> 02:14:25.895
MATT: No, he can heal other things.

02:14:25.895 --> 02:14:28.759
LAURA: How damaged is Scanlan Two already?

02:14:28.759 --> 02:14:29.877
SAM: A little.

02:14:29.877 --> 02:14:33.757
ASHLEY: Wait, from what?

02:14:33.757 --> 02:14:35.917
MATT: The skeleton dragon breath.

02:14:35.917 --> 02:14:51.384
SAM: All right. It's all good, guys. We're going to
be fine! Then Scanlan One will heal himself with a

02:14:51.384 --> 02:14:53.455
bonus action Healing Word.

02:14:53.455 --> 02:14:54.668
MATT: Okay.

02:14:54.668 --> 02:15:01.046
SAM: And then he'll grab Scanlan Two and Dimension
Door behind the dragon.

02:15:01.046 --> 02:15:02.455
MATT: Oh shit.

02:15:02.455 --> 02:15:05.152
LAURA: What are you doing?

02:15:05.152 --> 02:15:09.425
MATT: Both of these guys appear behind the dragon.
Right behind it?

02:15:09.425 --> 02:15:10.679
SAM: On the ground.

02:15:10.679 --> 02:15:12.393
LAURA: Do you know Sylas and Delilah are right
there?

02:15:12.393 --> 02:15:13.627
LIAM: By Delilah or here?

02:15:13.627 --> 02:15:14.993
SAM: Back there.

02:15:14.993 --> 02:15:18.455
LAURA: Sylas is right here. Right next to Sylas?

02:15:18.455 --> 02:15:19.459
SAM: Yeah.

02:15:19.459 --> 02:15:22.918
LAURA: You want both of you to be right behind
Sylas?

02:15:22.918 --> 02:15:28.153
MATT: I'm allowing you guys to move things. Thank
you.

02:15:28.153 --> 02:15:30.964
LAURA: Do you want melee range, or do you want
back ten feet?

02:15:30.964 --> 02:15:34.270
SAM: Back ten feet. That would be great.

02:15:34.270 --> 02:15:35.902
MATT: All right, so that's your action and bonus
action.

02:15:35.902 --> 02:15:38.742
TALIESIN: You can move.

02:15:38.742 --> 02:15:42.218
SAM: Wait, this was Scanlan One.

02:15:42.218 --> 02:15:45.174
MATT: Scanlan Two hasn't gone yet. Scanlan Two is
at the very end, with Keyleth.

02:15:45.174 --> 02:15:50.036
SAM: Scanlan One will walk around the side of the
thing.

02:15:50.036 --> 02:15:52.718
MATT: There you go. All right. Vax, you're up.

02:15:52.718 --> 02:15:55.016
LIAM: I really am? Oh my. Okay.

02:15:55.016 --> 02:16:05.306
MATT: Actually, at the end of the turn, Sylas is
going to use another legendary action. He got them

02:16:05.306 --> 02:16:08.620
back, actually, because he used it before last
turn. So he uses his first legendary action to

02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:17.643
head up.

02:16:17.643 --> 02:16:19.763
LAURA: He can climb up walls?

02:16:19.763 --> 02:16:30.064
MATT: He runs up the side. (impacts) He glances
down, looking towards where you are. All right,

02:16:30.064 --> 02:16:33.853
that's going to bring us to Vax's turn.

02:16:33.853 --> 02:16:37.947
LIAM: Yeah, okay, so if I get to the very edge
there, am I in range of Delilah on the ground

02:16:37.947 --> 02:16:42.593
with Sharpshooter? Cover doesn't do much, except
full cover.

02:16:42.593 --> 02:16:45.636
MATT: Yeah, she would have cover in this
circumstance, but you avoid it with Sharpshooter,

02:16:45.636 --> 02:16:46.655
so you can.

02:16:46.655 --> 02:16:48.805
LIAM: And am I within 60 feet over there, about?

02:16:48.805 --> 02:16:49.826
MATT: Yes.

02:16:49.826 --> 02:16:56.982
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to throw Whisper at her, and
she's down, so I have advantage. That is a 27 to hit.

02:16:57.048 --> 02:16:59.014
MATT: 27 to hit hits.

02:16:59.014 --> 02:17:00.587
LIAM: And I'm going to bamf there.

02:17:00.587 --> 02:17:09.837
MATT: She's prone, so yeah. You have disadvantage
on the attack against her.

02:17:09.837 --> 02:17:12.114
LIAM: What, because she's prone?

02:17:12.114 --> 02:17:18.721
MATT: It's a ranged attack. You don't have
advantage against her because there's nothing

02:17:18.721 --> 02:17:20.029
giving you advantage.

02:17:20.029 --> 02:17:21.562
LIAM: Her being prone doesn't give me advantage?

02:17:21.562 --> 02:17:25.598
MATT: No, her being prone, against ranged attacks,
it's with disadvantage. Roll a second time.

02:17:25.598 --> 02:17:27.346
LIAM: That's much worse.

02:17:27.346 --> 02:17:30.969
MARISHA: But it cancels out.

02:17:30.969 --> 02:17:32.912
LAURA: Because of Sharpshooter.

02:17:32.912 --> 02:17:37.593
MATT: Sharpshooter means he ignores cover. Doesn't
give him advantage on the attack roll.

02:17:37.593 --> 02:17:39.811
MARISHA: That sucks.

02:17:39.811 --> 02:17:43.696
MATT: Hold on, what was that one?

02:17:43.696 --> 02:17:44.794
LIAM: 18.

02:17:44.794 --> 02:17:51.205
MATT: 18 technically would hit. She's going to use
Shield as a reaction to add plus five to her AC.

02:17:51.205 --> 02:17:54.771
She's on her back and sees the dagger and goes
(ping) and deflects it off.

02:17:54.771 --> 02:18:01.529
LIAM: All right, second
attack is a natural 20.

02:18:01.529 --> 02:18:02.929
TRAVIS: Really?

02:18:02.929 --> 02:18:09.184
LIAM: Yeah. With Whisper, she has to make a saving
throw with a DC of 18 or become frightened of me

02:18:09.184 --> 02:18:10.873
for a minute, on a crit.

02:18:10.873 --> 02:18:16.820
MATT: What was the DC on that one?

02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:17.885
LIAM: 18.

02:18:17.885 --> 02:18:20.950
MATT: 18? She has a plus ten wisdom save, so
that's going to put her at a 20.

02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:31.390
LIAM: All right. (counting)

02:18:31.390 --> 02:18:33.784
LAURA: That's a great way to roll.

02:18:33.784 --> 02:18:42.156
LIAM: 72.

02:18:42.156 --> 02:18:44.147
MATT: 72?

02:18:44.147 --> 02:18:48.002
LIAM: Yeah, it's a crit. Double the dice.

02:18:48.002 --> 02:18:51.137
MATT: Right, but it's not sneak attack, though.

02:18:51.137 --> 02:18:55.490
LIAM: Oh, sorry, so. 32. Thank you.

02:18:55.490 --> 02:18:57.093
MATT: No worries.

02:18:57.093 --> 02:19:00.662
TRAVIS: Wow, your reverse math was super fast just
then. That would have taken me five minutes.

02:19:00.662 --> 02:19:01.974
MATT: All right.

02:19:01.974 --> 02:19:06.340
LIAM: And I'm going to bamf there on it.

02:19:06.340 --> 02:19:07.287
MATT: Okay.

02:19:07.287 --> 02:19:13.795
LAURA: It's fine.

02:19:13.795 --> 02:19:23.892
LIAM: Don't worry. And with my bonus action, I'm
going to throw my third dagger up at the wall. Can

02:19:23.892 --> 02:19:28.890
I throw Whisper again? Is it like quick draw, or
does it have to change daggers?

02:19:28.890 --> 02:19:35.100
MATT: Technically, I'd consider it to change
dagger, generally, because you're throwing them so fast.

02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:43.541
LIAM: All right, then instead I'm going to
disengage, and I'm going to dart back between the

02:19:43.541 --> 02:19:44.892
Scanlans.

02:19:44.892 --> 02:19:46.524
MARISHA: Between the Scanlans.

02:19:46.524 --> 02:19:49.837
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Vax?

02:19:49.837 --> 02:19:51.985
TRAVIS: Keyleth.

02:19:51.985 --> 02:19:57.325
MATT: At the end of your turn, Sylas is going to
use his second legendary action.

02:19:57.325 --> 02:20:01.665
LIAM: Wait, she used a reaction to knock the
dagger away.

02:20:01.665 --> 02:20:03.190
MATT: Sylas.

02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:11.225
LIAM: She used Shield, which is a reaction, so she
can't hit me with an attack of opportunity. Never mind.

02:20:11.225 --> 02:20:13.516
MATT: That's not what this is. Sylas is using a
legendary action. This has nothing to do with

02:20:13.516 --> 02:20:14.502
Delilah.

02:20:14.502 --> 02:20:16.102
LAURA: You're talking about your disengage. Don't
worry about it.

02:20:16.102 --> 02:20:20.950
MATT: Sylas is going to use his second legendary
action at the end of your turn to take a swing at

02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:23.389
Grog with his Greataxe of the Eclipse.

02:20:23.389 --> 02:20:25.619
LAURA: Greataxe of the Eclipse?

02:20:25.619 --> 02:20:26.776
MARISHA: Wait, Delilah or Sylas?

02:20:26.776 --> 02:20:27.746
LAURA: Sylas.

02:20:27.746 --> 02:20:28.964
MARISHA: Okay.

02:20:28.964 --> 02:20:32.860
MATT: That is a 21.

02:20:32.860 --> 02:20:34.022
TRAVIS: That hits.

02:20:34.022 --> 02:20:48.171
MATT: That is 14 points of damage, reduced to
seven, and I need you to make a wisdom saving

02:20:48.171 --> 02:20:49.291
throw, please.

02:20:49.291 --> 02:20:50.468
TALIESIN: With advantage.

02:20:50.468 --> 02:21:00.727
TRAVIS: With advantage. Oh, wait. That's a d10.
Natural 20.

02:21:00.727 --> 02:21:04.423
(relieved noises)

02:21:04.423 --> 02:21:06.656
TRAVIS: First one was a three.

02:21:06.656 --> 02:21:12.165
MATT: As the blade sinks across you, you resist
the impact, but you feel this cold sensation

02:21:12.165 --> 02:21:17.458
across the wound that begins to spill across your
body. You angrily, in your rage, flex against it

02:21:17.458 --> 02:21:24.545
and manage to withstand and shrug off the effect.
That ends that. Next up is Keyleth and Scanlan Two.

02:21:24.545 --> 02:21:27.649
SAM: Hey.

02:21:27.649 --> 02:21:31.621
MARISHA: Hey, Scanlan Two. Are you just as
charismatic as Scanlan One?

02:21:31.621 --> 02:21:35.012
SAM: I've got all the words to make the girls like
me.

02:21:35.012 --> 02:21:42.354
MARISHA: Okay, I don't care. Okay, Keyleth is
going to try to do a one-two punch here. She's

02:21:42.354 --> 02:21:49.689
going to move forward and then does she see
Delilah?

02:21:49.689 --> 02:21:55.692
MATT: Make a perception check. I'd say probably,
actually. You watched her get knocked back; you're fine.

02:21:55.692 --> 02:22:02.842
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to reach out and do an
Entangle spell right under her.

02:22:02.842 --> 02:22:05.081
MATT: Okay.

02:22:05.081 --> 02:22:10.514
MARISHA: Unless she can make a strength save
versus my spell shit.

02:22:10.514 --> 02:22:15.636
MATT: That is a four plus one. No.

02:22:15.636 --> 02:22:24.445
MARISHA: Fail, so she is restrained, and then I'm
going to run, and I'm going to use my Mantle of

02:22:24.445 --> 02:22:36.451
the Tempest to jump, and then trying to be dope,
here, in mid-air, I'm going to change into an

02:22:36.451 --> 02:22:42.895
earth elemental and try and grab onto the bone
dragon and see if I can snap his neck in the

02:22:42.895 --> 02:22:45.521
process. Grapple the bone dragon's head.

02:22:45.521 --> 02:22:47.368
MATT: Okay. Entangle is an action?

02:22:47.368 --> 02:22:54.136
MARISHA: Yes, and then I'm running and jumping and
grabbing for the rest of my movement.

02:22:54.136 --> 02:22:56.034
JOE: Do we need some more tape?

02:22:56.034 --> 02:22:59.516
MATT: Actually, I can finally use the layer over
here.

02:22:59.516 --> 02:23:03.874
LAURA: Do you want me to get the tape?

02:23:03.874 --> 02:23:16.745
MATT: All right, you leap over. That's the rest of your
turn. After entangling her, you run, leap, and as

02:23:16.745 --> 02:23:22.608
the wind from the mantle picks up, you watch this
gust of wind lift her. Make an athletics check.

02:23:22.608 --> 02:23:25.438
LAURA: To try to land on the dragon?

02:23:25.438 --> 02:23:32.398
MARISHA: A straight athletics? Yeah. (whimpers)
11.

02:23:32.398 --> 02:23:40.100
MATT: Okay. Not too bad. That's enough. It was
maybe a 15-foot jump at this point, and it's

02:23:40.100 --> 02:23:47.201
tripled because of your mantle, so you leap and
land, transforming into the elemental and

02:23:47.201 --> 02:23:50.796
grappling onto its back. All right. That ends your
turn, Keyleth. Scanlan Two?

02:23:50.796 --> 02:23:53.215
SAM: She's grappled now?

02:23:53.215 --> 02:23:54.506
MATT: She is, yes.

02:23:54.506 --> 02:23:56.453
MARISHA: Yeah. Fuck her shit up!

02:23:56.453 --> 02:23:58.516
TALIESIN: She's prone and grappled.

02:23:58.516 --> 02:24:01.003
MARISHA: Prone and grappled, and not for a very
long time.

02:24:01.003 --> 02:24:04.171
SAM: So if we hit her, it automatically hits,
right?

02:24:04.171 --> 02:24:07.359
MATT: Physically. You get advantage on attacks
against her.

02:24:07.359 --> 02:24:11.256
SAM: Is Bigby's Hand a magic attack or a physical
attack? It's a melee spell attack.

02:24:11.256 --> 02:24:13.660
MATT: It's a melee spell, so you get advantage on
the attack roll, yeah.

02:24:13.660 --> 02:24:21.237
SAM: Okay, then I'll change my plans and I'll do
that. Scanlan Two will cast Bigby's Hand at

02:24:21.237 --> 02:24:30.469
level-6 and pound her really hard. Shit.

02:24:30.469 --> 02:24:36.315
JOE: Is that a Philip Seymour Hoffman Happiness
reference?

02:24:36.315 --> 02:24:39.353
(laughter)

02:24:39.353 --> 02:24:50.314
SAM: Is that 6d8? Or 8d8? Bigby's Hand; I always
forget.

02:24:50.314 --> 02:25:00.073
MATT: It's 5th-level, and you've cast it at 6th,
correct? So it's an additional 2d8 to the punch.

02:25:00.073 --> 02:25:03.326
SAM: And it starts at 4d8? Oh, so it's only 6d8.

02:25:03.326 --> 02:25:05.416
JOE: Would you like to borrow some d8s?

02:25:05.416 --> 02:25:11.738
SAM: Yes. You know what? I'm going to do it at
level-7, then.

02:25:11.738 --> 02:25:13.135
MATT: You already said 6th.

02:25:13.135 --> 02:25:15.690
SAM: Okay. That's fine. All right, so a bunch of
d8s.

02:25:15.690 --> 02:25:19.035
MATT: You have to roll to hit first, so d20 with
advantage.

02:25:19.035 --> 02:25:24.699
SAM: 17 plus 11.

02:25:24.699 --> 02:25:27.744
MATT: Yeah, that hits, so roll your 6d8.

02:25:27.744 --> 02:25:32.445
SAM: Yeah. One, two, three, four, five.

02:25:32.445 --> 02:25:34.297
JOE: Or you can use the Smite dice.

02:25:34.297 --> 02:25:42.225
SAM: I like these. 29.

02:25:42.225 --> 02:25:44.915
MATT: All right.

02:25:44.915 --> 02:25:57.960
SAM: 29, and then I guess, as his bonus action,
he'll inspire Vax, who's not even here.

02:25:57.960 --> 02:26:01.343
MATT: Sing to the space where he was.

02:26:01.343 --> 02:26:11.353
SAM: Scanlan Two only knows the songs of Scanlan,
so he will sing, weirdly hollowly: (singing) When

02:26:11.353 --> 02:26:15.406
I get that feeling, I want Clarota healing.

02:26:15.406 --> 02:26:17.591
(laughter)

02:26:17.591 --> 02:26:19.899
SAM: He only knows the songs that he already
knows!

02:26:19.899 --> 02:26:22.259
TRAVIS: I told you, it's the jam.

02:26:22.259 --> 02:26:25.352
MATT: All right, so when he gets back, give him
the d12.

02:26:25.352 --> 02:26:33.216
SAM: And then he moves. He ducks back behind
there. Yeah, just peeking out a little so he can

02:26:33.216 --> 02:26:34.523
see where Bigby's Hand is.

02:26:34.523 --> 02:26:43.082
MATT: Okay. At the end of your turn, Sylas is going
to use his last legendary action to move his speed

02:26:43.082 --> 02:26:51.533
without provoking opportunity attacks. He leaps
off the side and lands right next to Delilah.

02:26:51.533 --> 02:26:56.211
MARISHA: Does he get entangled? Because he did
just land in difficult terrain.

02:26:56.211 --> 02:27:01.487
MATT: He's not entangled, I don't think, because
he wasn't there for the casting. Difficult terrain

02:27:01.487 --> 02:27:03.704
means he moves across at half.

02:27:03.704 --> 02:27:05.207
MARISHA: He's in difficult terrain.

02:27:05.207 --> 02:27:06.692
MATT: Okay. Good to know.

02:27:06.692 --> 02:27:11.427
MARISHA: I have rocky ground. That's all I have.

02:27:11.427 --> 02:27:26.107
MATT: All righty, so entangled... okay, yeah. Got
it. Cool. That ends the legendary action. Grog,

02:27:26.107 --> 02:27:27.631
you're up.

02:27:27.631 --> 02:27:34.630
TRAVIS: Can I jump to the top of the bannister
here so I'm looking down at old tangled-up

02:27:34.630 --> 02:27:47.508
Delilah. (sighs) May I leap off the tower and
straight onto Delilah's prone body?

02:27:47.508 --> 02:27:50.674
MATT: Sure. Make an athletics check.

02:27:50.674 --> 02:27:52.412
SAM: So romantic.

02:27:52.412 --> 02:27:55.624
LAURA: Feet stomping her chest?

02:27:55.624 --> 02:28:02.193
MATT: That's easy enough. Make an athletics check,
actually, in case something goes horribly bad. You

02:28:02.193 --> 02:28:04.297
are raging, so you get advantage.

02:28:04.297 --> 02:28:07.026
TRAVIS: 25.

02:28:07.026 --> 02:28:13.746
MATT: Okay. Easy enough. At that height, you take
eight points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to

02:28:13.746 --> 02:28:21.528
four, and (impact) you land, arcing over her, both
feet to each side of her, and you're standing,

02:28:21.528 --> 02:28:26.026
looming over her body as she's wrapped up in
vines, going (grunting).

02:28:26.026 --> 02:28:31.851
TRAVIS: I fucking hate this dead bitch. And I
raise the sword and start swinging down in these

02:28:31.851 --> 02:28:35.456
huge arcs at her. The first two attacks at her.

02:28:35.456 --> 02:28:42.632
MATT: Okay. As you pull the blade up, the voice
goes, "Yes. Her. She's part of the web. Her. Her!"

02:28:42.632 --> 02:28:48.352
And you give into the fury. Go ahead and make your
attacks.

02:28:48.352 --> 02:28:50.681
TRAVIS: Are they with advantage because she's
prone?

02:28:50.681 --> 02:28:52.230
MATT: Correct. Well, she's restrained.

02:28:52.230 --> 02:28:57.616
TRAVIS: So not reckless. Natural 20.

02:28:57.616 --> 02:29:01.278
(cheering)

02:29:01.278 --> 02:29:02.959
SAM: She's going to die.

02:29:02.959 --> 02:29:05.758
LIAM: Butcher that motherfucker!

02:29:05.758 --> 02:29:08.036
TRAVIS: Should I roll the second attack?

02:29:08.036 --> 02:29:12.871
MATT: Roll the damage first. She's hurt, but she's
not terrible. Yet.

02:29:12.871 --> 02:29:14.539
JOE: She's about to be terrible.

02:29:14.539 --> 02:29:15.857
MATT: Yeah.

02:29:15.857 --> 02:29:25.596
TRAVIS: (counting) 21 plus 14. Help me. 35?

02:29:25.596 --> 02:29:26.654
LAURA: 35.

02:29:26.654 --> 02:29:27.817
TRAVIS: 35.

02:29:27.817 --> 02:29:32.395
MARISHA: 21 plus 14? Yeah.

02:29:32.395 --> 02:29:39.731
TRAVIS: 35, okay. So that's those. Let me make
sure I'm doing this right. Oh, that's before the

02:29:39.731 --> 02:29:40.930
modifier.

02:29:40.930 --> 02:29:42.267
LAURA: 35 times two now?

02:29:42.267 --> 02:29:43.526
TRAVIS: Just 35.

02:29:43.526 --> 02:29:45.298
LIAM: Modifier goes on at the end.

02:29:45.298 --> 02:29:49.040
ASHLEY: What is it?

02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:51.069
TRAVIS: 51.

02:29:51.069 --> 02:29:59.415
LAURA: What do you get for the crit on Kas? What
do you get for the crit? That's why I'm asking if

02:29:59.415 --> 02:30:01.087
you double your dice.

02:30:01.087 --> 02:30:05.249
TRAVIS: No, I mean my brutal critical. I roll the
damage die, an additional--

02:30:05.249 --> 02:30:09.898
MATT: You roll the damage die, double that, add
the modifiers, and then the additional damage.

02:30:09.898 --> 02:30:11.106
MARISHA: And you're raging right?

02:30:11.106 --> 02:30:12.575
TRAVIS: Two times, yeah.

02:30:12.575 --> 02:30:14.265
MARISHA: Plus your rage damage, don't forget to
double that.

02:30:14.265 --> 02:30:16.040
TRAVIS: Two damage dies at this level.

02:30:16.040 --> 02:30:17.081
MATT: We'll see--

02:30:17.081 --> 02:30:19.771
JOE: This is that crazy new sword.

02:30:19.771 --> 02:30:21.518
MATT: Three, at 17th level.

02:30:21.518 --> 02:30:22.574
TRAVIS: Three?

02:30:22.574 --> 02:30:24.240
MATT: Yeah, so 3d10 additional.

02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:26.686
LAURA: Oh my god, so 51 plus 3d10.

02:30:26.686 --> 02:30:27.723
MATT: Correct.

02:30:27.723 --> 02:30:28.723
MARISHA: And is that doubled too?

02:30:28.723 --> 02:30:29.578
LAURA: No.

02:30:29.578 --> 02:30:30.392
MARISHA: Okay.

02:30:30.392 --> 02:30:31.925
SAM: That would be crazy.

02:30:31.925 --> 02:30:35.304
TRAVIS: 62. I rolled pretty low.

02:30:35.304 --> 02:30:41.740
MATT: Okay, so as you bring the blade down, with
this horrible screaming hiss--

02:30:41.740 --> 02:30:42.963
LAURA: That's one hit?

02:30:42.963 --> 02:30:50.566
MATT: Yeah, 62 points of damage. The blade jams
into her chest, and as you twist it she screams,

02:30:50.566 --> 02:30:55.982
and the blood from the wounds sprays out in the
middle of the air, freezes, and then slips into

02:30:55.982 --> 02:31:00.941
the blade as it's sucking up the blood. She's
like (grunts) entangled, and she reaches up and

02:31:00.941 --> 02:31:04.694
grabs the blade, and begins to start pulling it
out of the wound, she's (choking) as blood begins

02:31:04.694 --> 02:31:06.790
splattering up around her mouth, but she's still
alive.

02:31:06.790 --> 02:31:10.501
TRAVIS: Did you want it out? Here, let me help you
out (yells) and put it back in!

02:31:10.501 --> 02:31:12.611
MATT: Roll again.

02:31:12.611 --> 02:31:19.806
TRAVIS: That is a 32.

02:31:19.806 --> 02:31:21.517
MATT: Okay, roll damage.

02:31:21.517 --> 02:31:26.188
LAURA: I like it when the music stops, we're like
(hyperventilates).

02:31:26.188 --> 02:31:32.629
TRAVIS: 24.

02:31:32.629 --> 02:31:39.668
MATT: 24. You jam the blade in a second time, and
gash across and it carves open this part of her

02:31:39.668 --> 02:31:43.969
chest, and you can see the blood spatter out. The
bones are exposed, and she's on the ground,

02:31:43.969 --> 02:31:49.827
shaking. She's hanging on by a tether, and her
eyes are going wild, and she glances over, and her

02:31:49.827 --> 02:31:55.153
hand goes out. And you can see Sylas, who's right
next to her, his eyes are wide and he's reaching

02:31:55.153 --> 02:31:57.209
out to grasp for her hand.

02:31:57.209 --> 02:31:58.816
LAURA: (gravelly) Chop her hand off!

02:31:58.816 --> 02:32:01.075
MATT: Is that the end of your turn? Oh, you're
frenzied raging? Right.

02:32:01.075 --> 02:32:02.520
TALIESIN: Oh no. Yeah!

02:32:02.520 --> 02:32:03.680
MARISHA: Come on, come on Grog!

02:32:03.680 --> 02:32:05.366
TRAVIS: I was going to do something to Sylas but
fuck it, we're going to hit her.

02:32:05.366 --> 02:32:07.044
SAM: (whispered) Chop off her hand.

02:32:07.044 --> 02:32:10.014
LAURA: Chop off her whole arm.

02:32:10.014 --> 02:32:13.888
TRAVIS: 33 to hit.

02:32:13.888 --> 02:32:15.606
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

02:32:15.606 --> 02:32:20.375
LAURA: (singing) Please die Deliah, we want you
dead.

02:32:20.375 --> 02:32:22.720
TALIESIN: Third time's the charm.

02:32:22.720 --> 02:32:24.103
TRAVIS: 23.

02:32:24.103 --> 02:32:33.981
MATT: 23 points of damage? Are you rolling extra
undead damage on this? On these attacks? Because

02:32:33.981 --> 02:32:35.261
she's not undead.

02:32:35.261 --> 02:32:39.132
TRAVIS: Nope, nope. 23 plus-- I wasn't even
adding-- I was so excited about the sword damage I

02:32:39.132 --> 02:32:41.132
was forgetting my rage damage.

02:32:41.132 --> 02:32:43.623
MATT: Right, but you rolled 3d10 there.

02:32:43.623 --> 02:32:49.389
TRAVIS: I did, yeah. The d10 plus 2d10 slashing
damage to undead right?

02:32:49.389 --> 02:32:50.725
MATT: She's not undead though.

02:32:50.725 --> 02:32:51.591
TRAVIS: Oh, she's not?

02:32:51.591 --> 02:32:52.668
MATT: No.

02:32:52.668 --> 02:32:53.430
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

02:32:53.430 --> 02:32:57.797
MATT: You've been adding that to all the attacks?
Okay, noted. Roll--

02:32:57.797 --> 02:32:59.930
TRAVIS: I figured she was dead, then not dead--

02:32:59.930 --> 02:33:03.795
MATT: Roll 4d10 for me right now. I'm going to
retract that from the damage she's taken.

02:33:03.795 --> 02:33:08.523
TRAVIS: 22.

02:33:08.523 --> 02:33:15.350
MATT: She's still wounded, but she's not hanging
on by that thread. Okay, so the damage you rolled

02:33:15.350 --> 02:33:17.116
for that attack?

02:33:17.116 --> 02:33:20.233
TRAVIS: 24. But I hadn't added my--

02:33:20.233 --> 02:33:22.119
LAURA: So do your damage again because that--

02:33:22.119 --> 02:33:23.515
MATT: Roll the d10 and add your modifiers.

02:33:23.515 --> 02:33:25.181
TRAVIS: Okay fair enough. Shit, I'm so sorry.

02:33:25.181 --> 02:33:26.173
MATT: It's okay.

02:33:26.173 --> 02:33:30.056
LAURA: He wasn't doing his rage modifiers, so you
could add that then, potentially?

02:33:30.056 --> 02:33:31.870
MARISHA: The difference.

02:33:31.870 --> 02:33:33.155
TRAVIS: So that's 21.

02:33:33.155 --> 02:33:36.081
SAM: With your rage?

02:33:36.081 --> 02:33:37.148
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:33:37.148 --> 02:33:41.102
MATT: So as you hack in a third time with the
blade, making a smear of blood across the ground,

02:33:41.102 --> 02:33:47.752
the entangled vines that hold her there are
soaked in crimson at this point. And she's

02:33:47.752 --> 02:33:50.992
coughing and sputtering, you can see the open
wounds in her chest, and her hand reaching out

02:33:50.992 --> 02:33:55.977
"Sylas." And he's going for her at that point.
That's the end of your turn. She's still alive.

02:33:55.977 --> 02:33:57.305
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:33:57.305 --> 02:33:58.919
MATT: Vex, you're up.

02:33:58.919 --> 02:34:00.174
ASHLEY: Good job.

02:34:00.174 --> 02:34:02.083
TRAVIS: I thought she was undead, just figured.

02:34:02.083 --> 02:34:03.913
MATT: No, she's alive.

02:34:03.913 --> 02:34:05.639
JOE: She's a clone.

02:34:05.639 --> 02:34:08.625
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

02:34:08.625 --> 02:34:10.453
MARISHA: Yeah, I was wondering about that.

02:34:10.453 --> 02:34:12.317
TRAVIS: Sylas is undead.

02:34:12.317 --> 02:34:13.316
MATT: Correct.

02:34:13.316 --> 02:34:14.410
TRAVIS: The dragon's undead.

02:34:14.410 --> 02:34:15.851
JOE: No, because I've faced her before.

02:34:15.851 --> 02:34:17.424
TRAVIS: Are the gloomstalkers undead?

02:34:17.424 --> 02:34:18.907
MATT: No.

02:34:18.907 --> 02:34:20.642
TRAVIS: Not undead?

02:34:20.642 --> 02:34:22.091
LAURA: I bet she's a fucking clone.

02:34:22.091 --> 02:34:23.463
ASHLEY: What does that mean?

02:34:23.463 --> 02:34:24.677
LAURA: She made a clone of herself.

02:34:24.677 --> 02:34:28.007
MATT: That ends your turn. Vex.

02:34:28.007 --> 02:34:32.214
LAURA: Okay, so if I attack her, it's at
disadvantage? Or with--

02:34:32.214 --> 02:34:35.593
MATT: With a ranged attack? Yes, because she is--
well, she's restrained, which gives her advantage,

02:34:35.593 --> 02:34:38.707
so technically, it would be just a regular attack
roll.

02:34:38.707 --> 02:34:46.737
LAURA: Well then I'm going to attack her. She's
already restrained. Fuck it, I'm going to attack

02:34:46.737 --> 02:34:49.491
her with a blazing bowstring.

02:34:49.491 --> 02:34:50.734
MATT: Go for it.

02:34:50.734 --> 02:34:52.428
MARISHA: Kill her, kill her.

02:34:52.428 --> 02:34:58.671
LAURA: Yes. 17 plus 14, with sharpshooter.

02:34:58.671 --> 02:35:00.059
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

02:35:00.059 --> 02:35:24.716
LAURA: Minus five. Oh god, 15 plus two is 17, 25,
30, plus the blazing bowstring, 37. That's

02:35:24.716 --> 02:35:25.886
everything, right?

02:35:25.886 --> 02:35:27.518
TALIESIN: Did you do your plus ten for the
Sharpshooter?

02:35:27.518 --> 02:35:28.941
LAURA: 47 for Sharpshooter!

02:35:28.941 --> 02:35:30.045
TRAVIS: Hunter's Mark?

02:35:30.045 --> 02:35:31.521
LAURA: 47, I didn't Hunter's Mark it.

02:35:31.521 --> 02:35:34.618
MATT: 47 points of damage with the Sharpshooter.
How do you want to do this?

02:35:34.618 --> 02:35:38.171
(cheering)

02:35:38.171 --> 02:35:40.345
MARISHA: Get it girl! Get it girl!

02:35:40.345 --> 02:35:44.822
MATT: She was reaching out for that Dimension
Door.

02:35:44.822 --> 02:35:47.615
LAURA: Oh fuck!

02:35:47.615 --> 02:35:54.431
MATT: You see her hand reaching out, and you see
her fingers tracing the incantation in the air as

02:35:54.431 --> 02:35:58.382
Sylas' hand reaches outstretched for hers.

02:35:58.382 --> 02:36:04.287
LAURA: I point my finger down at her as I'm about
to shoot the arrow. As it shoots, I keep pointing

02:36:04.287 --> 02:36:07.337
at her like: How's it feel, bitch? How's it feel?

02:36:07.337 --> 02:36:12.407
MATT: As she reaches out, her eyes are locked with
Sylas. She's not even paying attention to Grog at

02:36:12.407 --> 02:36:15.045
this point, all she's focused on is escape. And
Grog as you look down at her and Sylas is looking

02:36:15.045 --> 02:36:20.504
into her face reaching out, the arrow just
(impact) through the jaw and out the side of her

02:36:20.504 --> 02:36:27.325
cheek there. (breath catches) and her eyes go
cold. The spell incantation fades and the hand

02:36:27.325 --> 02:36:30.924
just twitches and falls to the ground still.

02:36:30.924 --> 02:36:33.819
MARISHIA: That was so dope!

02:36:33.819 --> 02:36:35.047
ASHLEY: Yes!

02:36:35.047 --> 02:36:39.381
MATT: As that happens, Sylas, his hand still
reached out goes (yelling) "No!"

02:36:39.381 --> 02:36:44.976
LAURA: Oh I feel so bad for him.

02:36:44.976 --> 02:36:46.368
TRAVIS: No you don't.

02:36:46.368 --> 02:36:47.721
LAURA: I do have another attack!

02:36:47.721 --> 02:36:53.379
MATT: He turns around to look at you, "Vengeance,
I suppose, is mine this time."

02:36:53.379 --> 02:36:55.862
LAURA: And I attack him.

02:36:55.862 --> 02:36:58.413
MATT: This is a unique reversal of last time.

02:36:58.413 --> 02:37:02.175
LAURA: With blazing bowstring.

02:37:02.175 --> 02:37:03.221
MATT: Okay.

02:37:03.221 --> 02:37:08.629
LAURA: Sharpshooter. So 28 minus five hits?

02:37:08.629 --> 02:37:16.854
MATT: 28 minus five, yeah, that hits. That is the
end of Delilah Briarwood.

02:37:16.854 --> 02:37:18.367
TRAVIS: Like done?

02:37:18.367 --> 02:37:21.587
MATT: Clones take a while.

02:37:21.587 --> 02:37:33.300
LAURA: 33 damage to him. Seven of which is fire
damage.

02:37:33.300 --> 02:37:36.570
MATT: Gotcha. Is that the end of your turn?

02:37:36.570 --> 02:37:38.765
TRAVIS: Were her hands her own hands?

02:37:38.765 --> 02:37:40.875
MATT: They seemed to be.

02:37:40.875 --> 02:37:54.304
LAURA: I'm going to run down the stairs to the
lower level. Yeah, I'm in there.

02:37:54.304 --> 02:38:06.764
MATT: Okay. All right, first things first. As soon
as Delilah's body goes lifeless, Keyleth, you feel

02:38:06.764 --> 02:38:13.499
this sudden shift beneath your feet, as the bone
structure that maintains the body of the skeletal

02:38:13.499 --> 02:38:16.485
dragon collapses entirely.

02:38:16.485 --> 02:38:19.407
(cheering)

02:38:19.407 --> 02:38:21.200
LAURA: Two with one!

02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:29.468
TALIESIN: I was going to feel really guilty about
killing that thing.

02:38:29.468 --> 02:38:37.100
MATT: You suffer 11 points of bludgeoning damage.

02:38:37.100 --> 02:38:38.720
MARISHA: That's fine.

02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:42.638
MATT: Percy, you're up.

02:38:42.638 --> 02:38:48.558
TALIESIN: I want to try and come around here if
possible.

02:38:48.558 --> 02:38:51.769
MATT: With a speed of 30 you can do that, yeah.

02:38:51.769 --> 02:38:56.304
TALIESIN: Just here.

02:38:56.304 --> 02:38:58.469
SAM: Matt, don't forget those two guys.

02:38:58.469 --> 02:39:01.919
MATT: They just got there last turn.

02:39:01.919 --> 02:39:09.166
LAURA: Delilah's dead!

02:39:09.166 --> 02:39:12.551
MATT: Percy, what are you doing?

02:39:12.551 --> 02:39:20.686
TALIESIN: First thing I'm doing is I'm taking a
grit shot at Sylas with Animus. And I'm doing

02:39:20.686 --> 02:39:24.415
a headshot just to make his life a little more
complicated.

02:39:24.415 --> 02:39:26.458
LIAM: Do you get them at Reproductions, too?

02:39:26.458 --> 02:39:31.234
TALIESIN: I do, I'm taking very nice head shots.
Actually, I go to Prints Charming.

02:39:31.234 --> 02:39:33.052
MARISHIA: Do you really?

02:39:33.052 --> 02:39:35.061
SAM: That is not a place.

02:39:35.061 --> 02:39:37.185
TALIESIN: That's a real place. It's on Ventura.

02:39:37.185 --> 02:39:39.758
MATT: Percy! Roll your attack!

02:39:39.758 --> 02:39:43.929
TALIESIN: Sorry! The most LA moment in our game
ever! Just now!

02:39:43.929 --> 02:39:45.324
LIAM: I don't know about that.

02:39:45.324 --> 02:39:54.101
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, maybe not. Yep, that'll do,
that's a 26 to hit?

02:39:54.101 --> 02:39:55.471
MATT: That'll hit!

02:39:55.471 --> 02:40:00.280
TALIESIN: And he has to make a constitution saving
throw.

02:40:00.280 --> 02:40:04.499
MATT: Okay, He's going to use legendary resistance
to succeed.

02:40:04.499 --> 02:40:06.145
TALIESIN: That's fine.

02:40:06.145 --> 02:40:08.414
TRAVIS: His first one?

02:40:08.414 --> 02:40:09.703
MATT: His first one.

02:40:09.703 --> 02:40:15.794
TALIESIN: He still takes 16 points of damage and
two points of psychic damage.

02:40:15.794 --> 02:40:18.960
MATT: All righty, 18, got it.

02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:29.944
TALIESIN: And I'm going to take another headshot,
because that's funny. And that's 31 to hit.

02:40:29.944 --> 02:40:31.665
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage.

02:40:31.665 --> 02:40:41.938
TALIESIN: That's 12 points of damage and one
psychic damage. And does he make his constitution

02:40:41.938 --> 02:40:43.556
saving throw?

02:40:43.556 --> 02:40:45.586
MATT: He does actually, what's the DC on it?

02:40:45.586 --> 02:40:47.104
TALIESIN: The DC is 20.

02:40:47.104 --> 02:40:48.557
MATT: He rolled 20 exactly.

02:40:48.557 --> 02:40:54.345
TALIESIN: Fine. I'm going to take another
headshot. Burning my grit.

02:40:54.345 --> 02:40:57.856
SAM: Pew pew!

02:40:57.856 --> 02:41:06.781
TALIESIN: I should have gone for a Sharpshooter.
That's 34 to hit, Jesus Christ.

02:41:06.781 --> 02:41:08.093
MATT: That hits.

02:41:08.093 --> 02:41:10.235
TALIESIN: Another constitution saving throw.

02:41:10.235 --> 02:41:12.557
MATT: That is a 20 again!

02:41:12.557 --> 02:41:13.570
TALIESIN: God, motherfucker!

02:41:13.570 --> 02:41:15.222
MATT: 16 plus four both times.

02:41:15.222 --> 02:41:20.388
TALIESIN: That's 15 points of damage plus four
psychic. So 19 total.

02:41:20.388 --> 02:41:25.107
MATT: As he's there, his arm out, and he's
seething with rage, his eyes burning bright red,

02:41:25.107 --> 02:41:31.292
like the same shade as Grog's, which is
disconcerting. Each bullet hits him and he doesn't

02:41:31.292 --> 02:41:40.008
react. (bullets hitting) He's just looking down at
her and back up at Vex and down at her. Is that

02:41:40.008 --> 02:41:41.439
your turn?

02:41:41.439 --> 02:41:46.936
TALIESIN: No, I don't like the way he's doing
that, I'm burning an action surge. I'm going to

02:41:46.936 --> 02:41:56.404
use some Sharpshooter. I'm going to burn a bonus
and reload my gun. Let's just take three

02:41:56.404 --> 02:41:59.502
Sharpshooter shots, see what happens.

02:41:59.502 --> 02:42:04.396
MARISHIA: That one's cocked, I think.

02:42:04.396 --> 02:42:06.361
MATT: No, they're there.

02:42:06.361 --> 02:42:08.110
TALIESIN: I should not have rolled all three at
once.

02:42:08.110 --> 02:42:09.736
MATT: Oh well.

02:42:09.736 --> 02:42:24.359
TALIESIN: The way they landed, it would have been
the third one anyway. Two shots, that's 15 to hit? No.

02:42:24.359 --> 02:42:29.522
MATT: 15 misses. He puts a hand up without even
watching and deflects the bullet from the air.

02:42:29.522 --> 02:42:31.060
LAURA: He deflects the bullet?!

02:42:31.060 --> 02:42:32.237
TALIESIN: 20 to hit.

02:42:32.237 --> 02:42:36.921
MATT: 20 to hit? He's going to use his reaction to use
parry and the second bullet, with the other hand he

02:42:36.921 --> 02:42:42.164
shoots it off to the side. Not even looking at you
just staring at Vex still.

02:42:42.164 --> 02:42:44.068
LAURA: He's looking at me? Oh no.

02:42:44.068 --> 02:42:46.041
TALIESIN: And the third shots jams at a two.

02:42:46.041 --> 02:42:49.885
LAURA: No I ran away! He can't see me! I'm
downstairs.

02:42:49.885 --> 02:42:52.319
MATT: Glaring at the space you were when you ran.

02:42:52.319 --> 02:42:54.746
TRAVIS: Yeah, through all material.

02:42:54.746 --> 02:43:01.950
TALIESIN: Actually I have a resistance now to
psychic damage, so I take 1d6 psychic damage for

02:43:01.950 --> 02:43:03.700
my gun, not two, correct?

02:43:03.700 --> 02:43:04.847
MATT: Okay, yes you do.

02:43:04.847 --> 02:43:07.213
TALIESIN: I take my four points and I am happy for
them.

02:43:07.213 --> 02:43:08.131
MATT: That ends your turn!

02:43:08.131 --> 02:43:09.073
TALIESIN: That ends my turn.

02:43:09.073 --> 02:43:10.229
MATT: Arkhan.

02:43:10.229 --> 02:43:11.378
SAM: Come on, Arkhan.

02:43:11.378 --> 02:43:15.522
JOE: I command the gloomstalker to shriek. I just
read this.

02:43:15.522 --> 02:43:17.340
LAURA: What does it do when he shrieks?

02:43:17.340 --> 02:43:22.483
JOE: Within 60 feet, the gloomstalker emits a
terrible, shattering shriek that impacts all

02:43:22.483 --> 02:43:27.969
hostile creatures. Each must make a DC 16
constitution save or become stunned until the

02:43:27.969 --> 02:43:29.976
end of their next turn.

02:43:29.976 --> 02:43:31.234
MARISHA: Hell yeah.

02:43:31.234 --> 02:43:34.990
JOE: And it's the two up there, right?

02:43:34.990 --> 02:43:44.205
MATT: Technically they are, yeah. That's what they
were going to do next turn. So that's a two on the

02:43:44.205 --> 02:43:56.243
one gloomstalker. That is a 14, they both fail.
Both of the other gloomstalkers, all of a sudden

02:43:56.243 --> 02:44:02.489
(croaking) their heads begin writhing around. They
are stunned until their next turn. And Sylas is

02:44:02.489 --> 02:44:07.720
going to use his second legendary resistance of
the day.

02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:09.713
MARISHIA: We can burn him out. Burn him out.

02:44:09.713 --> 02:44:12.325
JOE: And now I'm unimpeded, direct. All the
way to him.

02:44:12.325 --> 02:44:13.969
MATT: Correct.

02:44:13.969 --> 02:44:15.248
LAURA: Destroy him!

02:44:15.248 --> 02:44:18.533
MATT: Fly this over to him.

02:44:18.533 --> 02:44:22.882
TALIESIN: High-five Keyleth on the way in.

02:44:22.882 --> 02:44:29.101
MATT: Cool! And?

02:44:29.101 --> 02:44:35.919
JOE: Okay and I'm going to do reckless on this.

02:44:35.919 --> 02:44:37.112
ASHLEY: Yeah you are.

02:44:37.112 --> 02:44:38.752
TRAVIS: Atta boy!

02:44:38.752 --> 02:44:48.724
LAURA: I like the magical flourish of the die.

02:44:48.724 --> 02:44:51.369
JOE: It's like some David Copperfield.

02:44:51.369 --> 02:44:52.673
MATT: Exactly.

02:44:52.673 --> 02:44:54.508
MARISHIA: Just salt bae your dice.

02:44:54.508 --> 02:44:55.512
JOE: Does 32 hit?

02:44:55.512 --> 02:44:56.512
MATT: 32 does hit.

02:44:56.512 --> 02:44:58.256
JOE: Okay great. Is this guy undead?

02:44:58.256 --> 02:45:00.299
MATT: Yes he is. He is a vampire.

02:45:00.299 --> 02:45:05.973
JOE: Out of curiosity, the bones of Delilah. She
deflated like a bag?

02:45:05.973 --> 02:45:09.780
MATT: She's dead. The skeleton fell into piles of
bones.

02:45:09.780 --> 02:45:11.275
SAM: She's okay.

02:45:11.275 --> 02:45:12.356
MATT: She's not okay.

02:45:12.356 --> 02:45:13.762
JOE: She's not a zombie.

02:45:13.762 --> 02:45:19.639
MATT: She's a slashed-up human. Her whole torso is
a mess. She has an arrow through her jaw and cheek.

02:45:19.639 --> 02:45:21.200
LAURA: Out her eyeball.

02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:35.980
JOE: Great. Well, then I would like to do a
2nd-level Divine Smite, which is going to be 6d8.

02:45:35.980 --> 02:45:40.156
TRAVIS: 6d8? Holy shit.

02:45:40.156 --> 02:45:49.143
JOE: I rolled badly. That's a 28.

02:45:49.143 --> 02:45:51.924
TRAVIS: (laughing) That's bad? Oh man.

02:45:51.924 --> 02:45:58.162
MATT: 28 points. All right, so as you rush forward
with your axe, you swing down into Sylas, who gets

02:45:58.162 --> 02:46:03.080
slammed in the side of the shoulder, and as the
spark of the Divine Smite energy slams into his

02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:08.206
side, you can see him: he's starting to feel the
pinch, all of you surrounding him.

02:46:08.206 --> 02:46:11.158
JOE: That's a cock.

02:46:11.158 --> 02:46:14.370
MATT: Roll again. It's a dice, actually.

02:46:14.370 --> 02:46:20.062
JOE: That's not great. That's 19.

02:46:20.062 --> 02:46:22.595
MATT: 19 does not hit, unfortunately.

02:46:22.595 --> 02:46:25.506
JOE: I would like to frenzy.

02:46:25.506 --> 02:46:29.413
MATT: Okay, so you're rolling your third strike.

02:46:29.413 --> 02:46:31.857
JOE: Frenzy, reckless.

02:46:31.857 --> 02:46:33.252
MATT: Yeah.

02:46:33.252 --> 02:46:37.049
JOE: That's going to be a 27.

02:46:37.049 --> 02:46:40.114
MATT: 27 hits. Roll damage.

02:46:40.114 --> 02:46:43.519
MARISHA: Kill him!

02:46:43.519 --> 02:46:45.590
JOE: I'll go 2nd-level Divine Smite again.

02:46:45.590 --> 02:46:50.155
TRAVIS: Come on, now!

02:46:50.155 --> 02:46:59.371
JOE: My friend John bought me some smite dice.
Let's go. Oh man, that's not a lot. That's rough,

02:46:59.371 --> 02:47:00.773
isn't it?

02:47:00.773 --> 02:47:03.345
MARISHA: Goddamn it, John.

02:47:03.345 --> 02:47:10.373
JOE: That's a 29, which was a terrible roll.

02:47:10.373 --> 02:47:18.578
MATT: First attack slams into it and bursts.
Second one, you swing and Sylas' form turns to

02:47:18.578 --> 02:47:23.526
shadow temporarily and dissipates around the blade
and returns. The third hit does strike true in the

02:47:23.526 --> 02:47:28.441
back of the head. (yelps) He yelps out in pain as
the blast bursts upward. You can see the flesh

02:47:28.441 --> 02:47:31.344
burning from the impact of the radiant damage.
That end your turn?

02:47:31.344 --> 02:47:34.336
JOE: I believe it will do so, yes.

02:47:34.336 --> 02:47:38.472
MATT: That brings us to Sylas' turn. Sylas does
not regenerate because the radiant damage kept it

02:47:38.472 --> 02:47:40.080
at bay.

02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:42.006
TRAVIS: I did not know that.

02:47:42.006 --> 02:47:45.417
JOE: It's why I did divine.

02:47:45.417 --> 02:47:49.474
MATT: Radiant damage prevented his regeneration.
Looking at his current circumstance, he's going to--

02:47:49.474 --> 02:47:50.660
MARISHA: No!

02:47:50.660 --> 02:47:54.565
MATT: You watch as he glances around and his body
(whoosh) into a bat.

02:47:54.565 --> 02:47:57.320
SAM: Scanlan Two's going to cast Counterspell.

02:47:57.320 --> 02:47:58.858
MATT: It's not a spell.

02:47:58.858 --> 02:48:00.317
(groaning)

02:48:00.317 --> 02:48:04.294
MATT: Scanlan Two goes to counter it, but there's
no spell to counter.

02:48:04.294 --> 02:48:06.001
MARISHA: Vampire bullshit!

02:48:06.001 --> 02:48:08.112
MATT: Turns into a bat (fluttering).

02:48:08.112 --> 02:48:12.110
MARISHA: I have a reaction! Can Keyleth the ellie
try to grab it?

02:48:12.110 --> 02:48:16.255
MATT: You don't get to grab, you get an attack of
opportunity.

02:48:16.255 --> 02:48:17.854
MARISHA: Can I?

02:48:17.854 --> 02:48:22.315
MATT: You get an attack of opportunity. &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; get
an attack of opportunity, and Grog gets an attack

02:48:22.315 --> 02:48:23.438
of opportunity.

02:48:23.438 --> 02:48:24.497
LAURA: And Bigby's Hand.

02:48:24.497 --> 02:48:25.541
MATT: Bigby's Hand does not get reactions.

02:48:25.541 --> 02:48:26.805
JOE: Does They get a attack of opportunity?

02:48:26.805 --> 02:48:28.072
MATT: Yeah, one attack.

02:48:28.072 --> 02:48:31.429
SAM: Against a bat.

02:48:31.429 --> 02:48:36.242
TALIESIN: Which means if you hit him enough, he
drops back to human.

02:48:36.242 --> 02:48:41.711
MATT: That's not how a vampire bat form works.
It's not a Polymorph. He has the same hit points

02:48:41.711 --> 02:48:43.403
in the bat form as he does in his normal form.

02:48:43.403 --> 02:48:46.392
TRAVIS: What if I made this a reckless tripping
attack?

02:48:46.392 --> 02:48:50.475
LAURA: Does that work on a bat? Can you trip a
bat?

02:48:50.475 --> 02:48:56.963
TRAVIS: I don't know. I don't know if it would
ground him for one second or not. I don't know.

02:48:56.963 --> 02:48:59.922
That's why I'm asking the DM.

02:48:59.922 --> 02:49:02.261
JOE: Who goes first out of all these attacks of
opportunity?

02:49:02.261 --> 02:49:03.513
MATT: You go first.

02:49:03.513 --> 02:49:07.356
JOE: Okay, then I would like to attempt to snatch
the bat with gloomstalker.

02:49:07.356 --> 02:49:09.097
MARISHA: Yes! Come on, yes!

02:49:09.097 --> 02:49:10.735
JOE: Has a snatch.

02:49:10.735 --> 02:49:12.042
MATT: Okay.

02:49:12.042 --> 02:49:13.866
MARISHA: Snatch that bat!

02:49:13.866 --> 02:49:15.594
ASHLEY: Get that snatch.

02:49:15.594 --> 02:49:18.585
MATT: Roll an attack.

02:49:18.585 --> 02:49:23.268
JOE: That's a 24.

02:49:23.268 --> 02:49:25.166
MATT: 24 hits.

02:49:25.166 --> 02:49:26.495
JOE: Snatched!

02:49:26.495 --> 02:49:27.903
SAM: What does that mean, snatched?

02:49:27.903 --> 02:49:35.010
JOE: The target is grappled. The target is
considered restrained. I can also fly with my

02:49:35.010 --> 02:49:43.032
grappled target at half of my speed. It's 2d6 plus
six piercing damage. Right?

02:49:43.032 --> 02:49:45.209
SAM: He doesn't like this.

02:49:45.209 --> 02:49:51.681
MATT: Because the snatch is a special attack,
essentially, as a reaction, because a reaction

02:49:51.681 --> 02:49:59.258
gives you a melee attack; it's not an actual
attack towards him-- let me double-check here for

02:49:59.258 --> 02:50:00.975
you guys real fast.

02:50:00.975 --> 02:50:06.152
JOE: Was that me trying to sneak one by?

02:50:06.152 --> 02:50:10.737
SAM: No. No, it doesn't say that it's special. Why
don't you plan a backup, just in case?

02:50:10.737 --> 02:50:19.042
MATT: Just double checking here. Okay.

02:50:19.042 --> 02:50:21.779
LIAM: How are you doing there, M?

02:50:21.779 --> 02:50:23.108
MARISHA: I'm nervous.

02:50:23.108 --> 02:50:24.504
TALIESIN: It's our fidget spinner.

02:50:24.504 --> 02:50:26.857
LAURA: I need a food for my nervousness.

02:50:26.857 --> 02:50:30.092
TALIESIN: I will let you know if it snaps while
it's in your teeth it hurts a lot. I know that

02:50:30.092 --> 02:50:31.369
from experience.

02:50:31.369 --> 02:50:34.105
MARISHA: Yeah, this is like what Dr. Seuss warns
us about as kids.

02:50:34.105 --> 02:50:35.542
LAURA: You could break your tooth.

02:50:35.542 --> 02:50:42.157
SAM: Guys, what are those shirts? Can you hold up
that shirt again? Oh, there it is.

02:50:42.157 --> 02:50:47.065
TALIESIN: This is the face Matt's not making right
now.

02:50:47.065 --> 02:50:53.734
JOE: After, if you want to enter the raffle, I'm
not sure how this works, but I brought this shirt.

02:50:53.734 --> 02:51:02.330
We're going to rub it all over Travis at break and
then the winner is going to get this shirt. These

02:51:02.330 --> 02:51:04.157
only come in extra large.

02:51:04.157 --> 02:51:08.447
MATT: I will say because I don't allow monsters
to use special attacks as reactions and haven't

02:51:08.447 --> 02:51:11.875
used them the entire game against you guys,
because that would've been much more dangerous, I

02:51:11.875 --> 02:51:14.306
won't allow it for this circumstance, but it does
still do the damage on the regular attack.

02:51:14.306 --> 02:51:19.671
JOE: Fine. Okay, great, then I'm going to bite
this right in the fucking nose.

02:51:19.671 --> 02:51:22.240
MATT: It'll still hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:51:22.240 --> 02:51:25.648
ASHLEY: It can also be a Halloween costume.

02:51:25.648 --> 02:51:26.971
SAM: Ooh!

02:51:26.971 --> 02:51:30.737
MARISHA: Oh my goodness! Matthew Mercer?!

02:51:30.737 --> 02:51:34.301
MATT: This got really weird suddenly.

02:51:34.301 --> 02:51:38.899
TALIESIN: We're going to show up to the next game,
all wearing them like a terrible Council of Evil.

02:51:38.899 --> 02:51:45.643
MARISHA: (laughter) Just the eyes cut out.

02:51:45.643 --> 02:51:51.903
JOE: Not bad. Do you want me to break it down,
piercing and necrotic?

02:51:51.903 --> 02:51:53.653
MATT: No, that's fine.

02:51:53.653 --> 02:51:55.031
JOE: Okay, 29 points.

02:51:55.031 --> 02:51:56.746
MATT: Actually, no, I do need two of those.

02:51:56.746 --> 02:52:03.660
JOE: Okay, then we're going to have 19 piercing
and eight necrotic.

02:52:03.660 --> 02:52:05.376
MATT: Okay. Cool.

02:52:05.376 --> 02:52:06.983
JOE: 19 and eight, 27.

02:52:06.983 --> 02:52:10.091
MATT: Make your attack of opportunity, your attack
of opportunity and your attack of opportunity.

02:52:10.091 --> 02:52:12.801
TRAVIS: I'm going to do reckless Trip attack.

02:52:12.801 --> 02:52:24.936
MARISHA: Don't. Fuck. Me. Gil! It's fine. It
kind of fucked me. 12.

02:52:24.936 --> 02:52:26.716
MATT: No. (ricochet noise) Off his armor.

02:52:26.716 --> 02:52:27.980
JOE: 30.

02:52:27.980 --> 02:52:29.248
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

02:52:29.248 --> 02:52:30.121
TRAVIS: 34.

02:52:30.121 --> 02:52:31.444
MATT: Hits, roll damage.

02:52:31.444 --> 02:52:33.719
TRAVIS: He's undead, right?

02:52:33.719 --> 02:52:34.687
MATT: Yes.

02:52:34.687 --> 02:52:35.864
JOE: You first, Grog.

02:52:35.864 --> 02:52:37.301
TRAVIS: Oh, no, please.

02:52:37.301 --> 02:52:38.406
JOE: No, no, no, you.

02:52:38.406 --> 02:52:41.063
TRAVIS: No, you were up first, I insist. Arkhan,
please.

02:52:41.063 --> 02:52:43.852
JOE: Yeah, but you did that dynamic jump, it was
really cool.

02:52:43.852 --> 02:52:46.024
MARISHA: Jocks were not this polite in the locker
room.

02:52:46.024 --> 02:52:48.810
SAM: They were to each other.

02:52:48.810 --> 02:52:59.837
TRAVIS: Yeah, 17 and then I roll a d8 or I add a
d8.

02:52:59.837 --> 02:53:02.325
MATT: d8 additional damage, yep.

02:53:02.325 --> 02:53:07.193
TRAVIS: It's my first one I've ever rolled. Five.
Shit, what did I say?

02:53:07.193 --> 02:53:08.110
MATT: 17.

02:53:08.110 --> 02:53:09.620
TRAVIS Thank you. 22.

02:53:09.620 --> 02:53:10.822
MATT: All right, 22 damage.

02:53:10.822 --> 02:53:13.374
TRAVIS: It's a trip attack.

02:53:13.374 --> 02:53:16.910
MATT: What does it say it does? I'll pull it up.

02:53:16.910 --> 02:53:21.017
TRAVIS: Oh, I'll pull it up. I've got it right
here.

02:53:21.017 --> 02:53:32.621
MATT: Here we go. Okay, a strength saving throw.
That's a natural one, so he's going to use his

02:53:32.621 --> 02:53:38.237
last legendary resistance to resist it. He's out
of legendary resistances now. All right, and

02:53:38.237 --> 02:53:39.705
damage on that one?

02:53:39.705 --> 02:53:50.596
JOE: Just pumped a 1st-level Divine Smite, and
that's going to be 21 plus three is 24, 24--

02:53:50.596 --> 02:53:54.623
TRAVIS: Does his hand turn into a bat with him? Or
does that fall--

02:53:54.623 --> 02:53:56.519
MATT: All of his equipment goes into his form.

02:53:56.519 --> 02:53:58.426
JOE: That's going to be 40 points of damage.

02:53:58.426 --> 02:54:04.508
MATT: As you all slam into the side of this bat
form it shrieks out and then just (flapping)

02:54:04.508 --> 02:54:08.432
it takes off and is going to use its
action to go ahead and go into a dash and continue

02:54:08.432 --> 02:54:09.636
to fly away.

02:54:09.636 --> 02:54:12.754
TALIESIN: I feel like I would be able to get an
attack somewhere in here considering my range if I

02:54:12.754 --> 02:54:14.361
pulled out my big gun.

02:54:14.361 --> 02:54:18.531
MATT: Oh yeah. No, we're coming back to that. He
is at that full speed and that form--

02:54:18.531 --> 02:54:20.556
TRAVIS: Plus we're still in initiative order.

02:54:20.556 --> 02:54:23.889
LIAM: Our reactions come from melee range.

02:54:23.889 --> 02:54:29.515
MATT: Okay. So that ends Sylas' turn. Pike, you're
up.

02:54:29.515 --> 02:54:31.640
ASHLEY: How far away is he?

02:54:31.640 --> 02:54:37.583
MATT: He would be about-- Let's say at that flying
speed of the bat, which I have to look up now,

02:54:37.583 --> 02:54:39.214
because that's a thing.

02:54:39.214 --> 02:54:43.200
TALIESIN: How could you not be prepared for--

02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:56.195
MATT: I know. What is this bullshit, Matt? Jesus
Christ! The bat's flying speed is 30 feet. So he's

02:54:56.195 --> 02:54:58.490
60 feet away from you guys at an angle that way.

02:54:58.490 --> 02:54:59.703
LAURA: Like here?

02:54:59.703 --> 02:55:04.643
MATT: Yeah. 60 feet up there. All right. Pike,
what are you doing?

02:55:04.643 --> 02:55:07.294
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to--

02:55:07.294 --> 02:55:10.450
MARISHA: I love your commitment to the tickle.

02:55:10.450 --> 02:55:19.578
ASHLEY: I'm trying to think of what I should do.
Okay, I'm going to try to Guiding Bolt it.

02:55:19.578 --> 02:55:20.983
MATT: Okay.

02:55:20.983 --> 02:55:24.117
LAURA: Guiding Bolt, up the butt! You want to move
forward so you can hit him?

02:55:24.117 --> 02:55:25.025
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:55:25.025 --> 02:55:31.553
MATT: Guiding Bolt, I believe you have to roll
your attack on that one? Yeah, make a ranged spell

02:55:31.553 --> 02:55:32.652
attack.

02:55:32.652 --> 02:55:40.811
ASHLEY: 18.

02:55:40.811 --> 02:55:42.523
MATT: 18 does not hit.

02:55:42.523 --> 02:55:44.248
ASHLEY: I'm going to use Guided Strike.

02:55:44.248 --> 02:55:45.553
MATT: Okay.

02:55:45.553 --> 02:55:48.407
ASHLEY: Which adds plus ten, so 28.

02:55:48.407 --> 02:55:50.078
MATT: You can use it on yourself, right?

02:55:50.078 --> 02:55:53.975
ASHLEY: Yeah. Guided Strike is for myself, War
God's Blessing is somebody else.

02:55:53.975 --> 02:55:56.284
MATT: That's what it is. Yeah. Go for it. That
hits, go ahead and roll damage.

02:55:56.284 --> 02:56:03.709
ASHLEY: I'm going to do it at 3rd level, so that's
four, 6d6.

02:56:03.709 --> 02:56:06.246
LAURA: 6d6?

02:56:06.246 --> 02:56:08.143
MATT: 6d6 radiant damage.

02:56:08.143 --> 02:56:13.483
LAURA: All radiant! That is a really good roll.

02:56:13.483 --> 02:56:15.098
TALIESIN: That looks solid from here.

02:56:15.098 --> 02:56:18.837
SAM: Ashley Johnson. Clutch. Bicoastal Roll.

02:56:18.837 --> 02:56:21.131
MATT: Bicoastal Roll?

02:56:21.131 --> 02:56:28.735
ASHLEY: Okay, 23.

02:56:28.735 --> 02:56:36.953
MATT: 23. (impact) The bat now is shining; the
next attack against it has advantage. End of your turn?

02:56:36.953 --> 02:56:52.561
ASHLEY: Let me see. My bonus actions. Ugh, I don't
want to use that in case. Okay, that's it.

02:56:52.561 --> 02:56:57.396
MATT: All right. End of your turn, going to use
its Legendary Action to move at speed; the bat is

02:56:57.396 --> 02:57:07.760
now 90 feet away. That ends your turn, that brings
us to Scanlan. Oh, the gloomstalkers, actually,

02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:11.887
which are no longer stunned. But that's the end of
their turn. End of the gloomstalkers' turn, it's

02:57:11.887 --> 02:57:16.037
going to use another Legendary Action to move
another 30, so it's 120 feet away. Scanlan, you're up.

02:57:16.037 --> 02:57:18.417
LAURA: He's really far away from us now.

02:57:18.417 --> 02:57:19.868
MATT: He's just full sprint.

02:57:19.868 --> 02:57:21.871
LIAM: You said 120 feet away?

02:57:21.871 --> 02:57:22.996
MATT: 120 feet, yeah.

02:57:22.996 --> 02:57:27.371
LAURA: Can you do anything at 120 feet, Scanlan?

02:57:27.371 --> 02:57:29.478
SAM: I can do something. I can do one thing.

02:57:29.478 --> 02:57:31.934
MARISHA: If you guys let me go right now I can
try-- You can do something?

02:57:31.934 --> 02:57:40.830
SAM: Scanlan One will just hold his turn until
those gloomstalkers are in range or until they

02:57:40.830 --> 02:57:45.774
move, and then he'll cast, I don't know, frigging
Wand of Magic Missiles, I don't know.

02:57:45.774 --> 02:57:50.599
MATT: Sure. All right, end of Scanlan's turn, will
use third and final Legendary Action, is now 150

02:57:50.599 --> 02:57:51.858
feet away.

02:57:51.858 --> 02:57:54.050
MARISHA: No! Let me go first!

02:57:54.050 --> 02:57:55.872
MATT: We're now at Vax's turn.

02:57:55.872 --> 02:57:57.512
LAURA: Yeah, you can't switch your initiative.

02:57:57.512 --> 02:58:01.564
MARISHA: You can if other people hold. And you
describe--

02:58:01.564 --> 02:58:06.525
MATT: They can hold their action, but then at the
end of their turn, he still gets to do movement.

02:58:06.525 --> 02:58:14.387
LIAM: All right, I'm going to use my movement and
dash, so five, ten, 15... 50, 55, 60, and I'm

02:58:14.387 --> 02:58:17.686
going to paladin attack the gloomstalker up
there.

02:58:17.686 --> 02:58:19.019
MATT: Okay.

02:58:19.019 --> 02:58:32.044
LIAM: First one is great, that is a 33. And the
second one is also pretty good, 25. Do those both hit?

02:58:32.044 --> 02:58:37.159
MATT: They both have an AC of 15.

02:58:37.159 --> 02:58:44.547
LIAM: Okay, shit. Should've called Sharpshooter.
All right, so the first one is one, plus eight is nine--

02:58:44.547 --> 02:58:49.593
TRAVIS: Can he use a legendary resistance on a
grapple?

02:58:49.593 --> 02:58:52.449
MATT: No, because a grapple check is a versus.

02:58:52.449 --> 02:58:59.390
LIAM: Seven, so 11 and seven. Just 11 and seven on
that Gloomstalker.

02:58:59.390 --> 02:59:03.992
MATT: Got it. Ends your turn, Keyleth, you're up.

02:59:03.992 --> 02:59:05.728
MARISHA: How far away is he?

02:59:05.728 --> 02:59:07.951
MATT: 150 feet. from where he was.

02:59:07.951 --> 02:59:15.040
MARISHA: I'm going to drop my form, take my action
to cast Earthbind on him, it's a 300-foot range spell.

02:59:15.040 --> 02:59:20.645
LAURA: Oh my God. Please, please, please. He's
used up his legendary resistances, right?

02:59:20.645 --> 02:59:21.812
MARISHA: He did.

02:59:21.812 --> 02:59:23.395
MATT: What's the save he has to make?

02:59:23.395 --> 02:59:25.101
MARISHA: Strength versus my spell save.

02:59:25.101 --> 02:59:27.125
TALIESIN: Do you have something because of your
hit?

02:59:27.125 --> 02:59:29.887
MATT: That is 22. 17 plus five.

02:59:29.887 --> 02:59:32.019
MARISHA: 22?!

02:59:32.019 --> 02:59:37.241
MATT: 17 plus five.

02:59:37.241 --> 02:59:39.119
MARISHA: You can't do anything?

02:59:39.119 --> 02:59:40.974
TALIESIN: The last time you hit him, does that
mean--

02:59:40.974 --> 02:59:42.331
LAURA: Advantage!

02:59:42.331 --> 02:59:46.680
MATT: It's a saving throw, it's not an attack.
Yeah, the Earthbind does not take effect on him

02:59:46.680 --> 02:59:47.936
unfortunately--

02:59:47.936 --> 02:59:50.763
MARISHA: Can I do it again immediately? Can I try
again?

02:59:50.763 --> 02:59:52.860
MATT: No, it's an action to cast the spell.

02:59:52.860 --> 02:59:54.077
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:59:54.077 --> 02:59:55.190
MATT: Sorry.

02:59:55.190 --> 02:59:57.135
MARISHA: I know! Can I wait and--

02:59:57.135 --> 03:00:01.920
MATT: Okay, Scanlan Two? Anything?

03:00:01.920 --> 03:00:04.614
SAM: He's 150 feet away?

03:00:04.614 --> 03:00:06.469
MARISHA: He rolled so fucking high!

03:00:06.469 --> 03:00:08.142
LAURA: Can you run 30 feet and then do something?

03:00:08.142 --> 03:00:09.265
MATT: He can run 25 feet.

03:00:09.265 --> 03:00:12.121
SAM: I can run 25 feet and then reach 120 feet.

03:00:12.121 --> 03:00:14.066
MATT: Yeah, you're just under--

03:00:14.066 --> 03:00:15.864
SAM: I'm five feet shy.

03:00:15.864 --> 03:00:18.313
JOE: Wait. I can get you on the back of this thing
and fly it up there.

03:00:18.313 --> 03:00:22.635
LIAM: Yeah, but we can't get out of range of the
ring unless we want to--

03:00:22.635 --> 03:00:25.472
LAURA: I mean, as soon as Sylas isn't there, he's
going to know we're here.

03:00:25.529 --> 03:00:27.735
JOE: So we have to stay within 60 feet. Of each
other.

03:00:27.735 --> 03:00:30.007
LAURA: Or we can all just run.

03:00:30.007 --> 03:00:33.038
MARISHA: If you all hold, I can try again.

03:00:33.038 --> 03:00:35.056
TALIESIN: No, because he's going to keep running.

03:00:35.056 --> 03:00:36.311
LAURA: If we hold, he just keeps moving--

03:00:36.311 --> 03:00:40.500
MARISHA: Yeah, but it's a 300-foot range spell,
and he's only 150 feet away. I don't think he can dash 150 feet.

03:00:40.500 --> 03:00:45.770
SAM: He already did 150 getting to your turn so
he'll be able to do another 150--

03:00:45.770 --> 03:00:47.915
MARISHA: But it's a 300-foot range spell.

03:00:47.915 --> 03:00:49.323
LIAM: He'd still be in range--

03:00:49.323 --> 03:00:52.886
TALIESIN: We don't have to hold our turns, we'll
just get back to you.

03:00:52.886 --> 03:00:55.027
MARISHA: Right. That's what I'm saying.

03:00:55.027 --> 03:00:59.752
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, we're fine. I mean, that'll
happen eventually. If it's going to get there.

03:00:59.752 --> 03:01:01.068
LAURA: Whose turn is it?

03:01:01.068 --> 03:01:06.514
SAM: It's Scanlan Two's turn. He's going to bonus
action Bigby's Hand, grapple one of the

03:01:06.514 --> 03:01:08.398
gloomstalkers.

03:01:08.398 --> 03:01:09.776
MATT: Okay.

03:01:09.776 --> 03:01:12.255
SAM: The one we've been working on.

03:01:12.255 --> 03:01:15.353
MATT: All righty. Bigby's Hand punches--

03:01:15.353 --> 03:01:17.942
SAM: Not punches, grapple.

03:01:17.942 --> 03:01:22.666
MATT: Okay. We'll say for the purposes of this,
they're--

03:01:22.666 --> 03:01:24.158
SAM: They're easily killed.

03:01:24.158 --> 03:01:26.650
MATT: They're pretty easily killed given the
circumstances you guys have, the chase now--

03:01:26.650 --> 03:01:31.290
SAM: Well, do you want to kill them, or save them
for riding on?

03:01:31.290 --> 03:01:32.712
JOE: Bah! I think I'm--

03:01:32.712 --> 03:01:34.663
(laughter)

03:01:34.663 --> 03:01:42.895
JOE: 40 minus three is 37, This one's got 37 hit
points of damage.

03:01:42.895 --> 03:01:46.872
LAURA: Just try to get Sylas.

03:01:46.872 --> 03:01:48.637
JOE: Do what you feel, Scanlan.

03:01:48.637 --> 03:01:50.831
SAM: Well, I'll just hold him for you.

03:01:50.831 --> 03:01:53.977
JOE: Oh, thanks. I appreciate that--

03:01:53.977 --> 03:01:55.963
MATT: Let's say, Grog, you go up there and start.
Anything you want to do--

03:01:55.963 --> 03:01:58.969
TRAVIS: I want to see what the inside of them
looks like.

03:01:58.969 --> 03:02:02.572
MATT: Okay. For the purposes of expediency in
this, so we don't spend time just trudging through

03:02:02.572 --> 03:02:06.118
these things, you guys just hacking at these
gloomstalkers.

03:02:06.118 --> 03:02:07.798
SAM: One we're saving for him.

03:02:07.798 --> 03:02:13.963
MATT: Okay, I will say, to note, that the Control
feature generally is a once-a-day type thing--

03:02:14.039 --> 03:02:15.425
SAM: Ooh. Then never mind, we kill it.

03:02:15.425 --> 03:02:18.170
MATT: Not like it can constantly regenerate to the
next thing.

03:02:18.170 --> 03:02:26.464
JOE: Hmm. Let me read my description that you sent
me. All right. No, okay. I'm calling Mike Mearls!

03:02:26.464 --> 03:02:35.170
MARISHA: We get back around everybody! Is he still
fucking here?!

03:02:35.170 --> 03:02:37.343
MATT: We get to Sylas' turn. Sylas dashes twice--

03:02:37.343 --> 03:02:39.116
TALIESIN: Wait, is it Sylas' turn or my turn?

03:02:39.116 --> 03:02:40.976
MATT: Sorry, it's your turn then Sylas', so go
ahead.

03:02:40.976 --> 03:02:45.361
TALIESIN: My turn first. I'm going to take my
advantage shot, because I have advantage because of--

03:02:45.361 --> 03:02:46.815
MATT: With which gun?

03:02:46.815 --> 03:02:47.962
TALIESIN: With Bad News.

03:02:47.962 --> 03:02:48.993
MATT: Okay.

03:02:48.993 --> 03:02:50.219
LAURA: Wait, why didn't I get to go?

03:02:50.219 --> 03:02:51.600
MATT: Oh sorry, you're first. Go for it.

03:02:51.600 --> 03:02:54.834
LAURA: Can I run out the door and hop on my broom
and fly as far as I can--

03:02:54.834 --> 03:02:56.000
TALIESIN: No, no, no, no!

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:57.173
JOE: 60!

03:02:57.173 --> 03:02:57.984
TALIESIN: Ring!

03:02:57.984 --> 03:03:01.994
LAURA: Yeah, but I can only get 50 feet away from
you guys. If I come here--

03:03:01.994 --> 03:03:07.327
MATT: As soon as you go around that side, you're
starting to get close. Up to you. You have Scanlan

03:03:07.327 --> 03:03:09.309
all the way over there. You barely have Scanlan in
your--

03:03:09.309 --> 03:03:13.706
LAURA: So I can't leave. So I'm at the bottom of
the stairs. If I run up the stairs and broom it

03:03:13.706 --> 03:03:15.869
from here, how far would I get?

03:03:15.869 --> 03:03:19.755
MATT: Ten feet out the window.

03:03:19.755 --> 03:03:28.256
LAURA: Ten feet out the window and he's 150 and
I'm-- my shot is what, but with Sharpshooter-- no,

03:03:28.256 --> 03:03:29.320
that's different.

03:03:29.320 --> 03:03:34.188
LIAM: Doesn't affect range, it just affects your
chances.

03:03:34.188 --> 03:03:38.393
LAURA: Shit! Wait, let me look at Fenthras. I'm
just hoping there's something that says it's 300 feet!

03:03:38.393 --> 03:03:40.326
MATT: Fenthras does not change your range.

03:03:40.326 --> 03:03:44.779
LAURA: (nervous laughter) Okay then, it's only
120-foot range, right? With a longbow?

03:03:44.779 --> 03:03:52.484
MATT: Well, the way longbows work is you have an
inner range and an outer range, so if he's

03:03:52.484 --> 03:03:53.641
beyond--

03:03:53.641 --> 03:03:55.561
TALIESIN: But if you're Sharpshooter the outer
range is the inner range.

03:03:55.561 --> 03:03:56.715
LAURA: Oh, yeah!

03:03:56.715 --> 03:03:59.943
MATT: Yeah, your max is 600.

03:03:59.943 --> 03:04:01.676
LAURA: My max is 600 fucking feet?

03:04:01.676 --> 03:04:03.808
MATT: Yep.

03:04:03.808 --> 03:04:05.324
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, so you just walk up and take a
shot.

03:04:05.324 --> 03:04:10.574
LAURA: Okay then, I'm going to walk up to the
window and I'm going to try to cast Bramble Shot

03:04:10.574 --> 03:04:11.791
on him.

03:04:11.791 --> 03:04:14.613
TALIESIN: With advantage!

03:04:14.613 --> 03:04:16.316
LAURA: With advantage?

03:04:16.316 --> 03:04:17.388
SAM: It's an attack.

03:04:17.388 --> 03:04:18.287
ASHLEY: Because of--

03:04:18.287 --> 03:04:19.794
MATT: Guiding Bolt. Go for it.

03:04:19.794 --> 03:04:21.859
TALIESIN: Much better!

03:04:21.859 --> 03:04:23.449
JOE: Holy freaking half-elf!

03:04:23.449 --> 03:04:28.666
LAURA: 20.

03:04:28.666 --> 03:04:30.009
MATT: 20 just hits.

03:04:30.009 --> 03:04:33.246
(cheering)

03:04:33.246 --> 03:04:36.825
MARISHA: Get him down!

03:04:36.825 --> 03:04:51.060
LAURA: Oh my God. Okay, so 12, that's 18 plus
4d8.

03:04:51.060 --> 03:04:52.930
LIAM: Sharpshooter doesn't double the distance?

03:04:52.930 --> 03:04:56.014
MATT: No, but you have the two different ranges.
Because your range is technically 30 to 60, but

03:04:56.014 --> 03:04:58.540
you can go the full 60 without taking disadvantage
after 30 feet.

03:04:58.540 --> 03:05:00.929
LIAM: So it's at disadvantage normally?

03:05:00.929 --> 03:05:04.471
MATT: No disadvantage as a Sharpshooter. It's a
crazy feat.

03:05:04.471 --> 03:05:06.175
LAURA: 43.

03:05:06.175 --> 03:05:08.442
MATT: 43 points of damage.

03:05:08.442 --> 03:05:13.174
LAURA: And he has to make a strength save of DC 17
or be restrained.

03:05:13.174 --> 03:05:17.439
MATT: That is a nine plus five, that is a 14.

03:05:17.439 --> 03:05:19.021
(cheering)

03:05:19.021 --> 03:05:25.105
MATT: As the arrow hits the bat, you watch as the
arrow bursts into a sudden swarming of bramble

03:05:25.105 --> 03:05:29.787
vines. They wrap around him and the bat (small
impact).

03:05:29.787 --> 03:05:32.969
LAURA: And does he take bludgeoning damage from
hitting the ground?

03:05:32.969 --> 03:05:38.691
MATT: He does take a little bit. He's about 80
feet up from there, because he's going at an

03:05:38.691 --> 03:05:41.201
angle, so he takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage.

03:05:41.201 --> 03:05:49.330
SAM: Oh my God! That was the most sniper thing
you've ever done!

03:05:49.330 --> 03:05:50.958
LAURA: That was pretty awesome!

03:05:50.958 --> 03:06:04.091
MATT: And with that, you watch as the bat form
(poof) dissipates. The brambles fall weak and open.

03:06:04.091 --> 03:06:06.011
SAM: Is he there?

03:06:06.011 --> 03:06:07.944
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:06:07.944 --> 03:06:10.305
LAURA: Can I see him?

03:06:10.305 --> 03:06:12.354
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:06:12.354 --> 03:06:14.760
SAM: No bueno.

03:06:14.760 --> 03:06:16.741
LIAM: I got 26 for Vax.

03:06:16.741 --> 03:06:23.205
MATT: You see a misty cloud in the space where
Sylas was.

03:06:23.205 --> 03:06:30.991
LAURA: 34. Misty cloud! How did we fight him
before? Sunlight destroyed him before?

03:06:30.991 --> 03:06:32.212
SAM: Radiant something, right?

03:06:32.212 --> 03:06:34.007
LAURA: Sunbeam destroyed him before.

03:06:34.007 --> 03:06:35.476
TRAVIS: When he was in the gaseous form.

03:06:35.476 --> 03:06:39.420
LAURA: Now he's in the gaseous form. Okay, so I
rolled a 34.

03:06:39.420 --> 03:06:44.049
TALIESIN: I rolled huge. 28.

03:06:44.049 --> 03:06:46.244
MATT: 28? To what?

03:06:46.244 --> 03:06:47.254
TALIESIN: Perception.

03:06:47.254 --> 03:06:48.792
MATT: Yeah, you see the mist.

03:06:48.792 --> 03:06:49.905
TALIESIN: How far away is he?

03:06:49.905 --> 03:06:53.854
LAURA: He's 150 feet away.

03:06:53.854 --> 03:06:57.277
LIAM: He didn't get a chance to go.

03:06:57.277 --> 03:07:00.577
LAURA: He's 150 feet away from us.

03:07:00.577 --> 03:07:02.112
MATT: Yeah.

03:07:02.112 --> 03:07:09.852
LAURA: So as a group we can all try to move
forward, but as we get closer to him--

03:07:09.852 --> 03:07:14.062
TALIESIN: You've got what it takes. What's the
distance on that thing?

03:07:14.062 --> 03:07:18.557
LAURA: What's the Daylight casting distance? Can
you run forward and get close enough?

03:07:18.557 --> 03:07:24.524
MARISHA: You guys aren't going to want to hear
this, I can run forward and Sunburst him at 150

03:07:24.524 --> 03:07:26.471
feet away but it's going to burn my 8th-level
spell.

03:07:26.471 --> 03:07:27.838
SAM: Don't do that.

03:07:27.838 --> 03:07:37.674
MARISHA: I have Sunbeam, which is a 6th-level
spell at 60-foot away. No, I dropped my form.

03:07:37.674 --> 03:07:38.746
MATT: Yep.

03:07:38.746 --> 03:07:40.798
TALIESIN: What if you got on a mount?

03:07:40.798 --> 03:07:45.027
SAM: Just to get there as fast as you can.

03:07:45.027 --> 03:07:46.996
JOE: But we can't get outside of the 60-foot
bubble.

03:07:46.996 --> 03:07:50.502
TALIESIN: We can all move together and he will not
be able to move at high speed as a mist.

03:07:50.502 --> 03:07:51.579
LAURA: Hopefully.

03:07:51.579 --> 03:07:56.609
MARISHA: Can I scoop up Vex and dash 60 feet ahead
and Sunbeam him for another 60 feet?

03:07:56.609 --> 03:08:01.285
MATT: Dash as your action.

03:08:01.285 --> 03:08:02.528
TALIESIN: And we have to stay together.

03:08:02.528 --> 03:08:03.670
LAURA: We have to stay together.

03:08:03.670 --> 03:08:06.745
JOE: Well, you're in the gray. No. Where are you?

03:08:06.745 --> 03:08:09.592
MARISHA: I'm green.

03:08:09.592 --> 03:08:15.981
LAURA: I'm technically right here, right now. I'm
on the second level. Next to Pike.

03:08:15.981 --> 03:08:17.371
JOE: And Bigby's is--

03:08:17.371 --> 03:08:19.381
SAM: Is it your turn Keyleth?

03:08:19.381 --> 03:08:21.427
MARISHA: Yeah, whose turn is it?

03:08:21.427 --> 03:08:23.510
MATT: It's finishing Vex's.

03:08:23.510 --> 03:08:25.114
LAURA: No, it's Percy's turn.

03:08:25.114 --> 03:08:26.875
MATT: Okay, so Percy. Your turn.

03:08:26.875 --> 03:08:28.930
LAURA: You could technically try to sh-- Oh yeah,
mist form.

03:08:28.930 --> 03:08:32.618
(laughter)

03:08:32.618 --> 03:08:34.999
JOE: Was that a Jenga?

03:08:34.999 --> 03:08:48.050
TALIESIN: Wait. I have a weird thing I'm going to
try and do-- No, the thing I need to do, I need to

03:08:48.050 --> 03:08:49.104
get within 30 feet.

03:08:49.104 --> 03:08:52.560
LAURA: Well, you can get within 60 feet of me so
just move toward--

03:08:52.560 --> 03:08:57.763
TALIESIN: I'm going to move to the edge of where
I'm capable of moving right now at my speed. I'm

03:08:57.763 --> 03:09:04.695
going to signal everybody and say move as a group.
So we're going to try to sync our movements.

03:09:04.695 --> 03:09:19.503
MATT: All right. We'll say for the purposes of
this, the mist travels and vanishes from sight by

03:09:19.503 --> 03:09:25.325
the time you are able to catch up to it to get it
to a place where you can destroy it. Delilah

03:09:25.325 --> 03:09:34.263
Briarwood has been destroyed, seemingly for the
last time. Sylas has been driven to wherever he

03:09:34.263 --> 03:09:38.277
needs to recover.

03:09:38.277 --> 03:09:39.937
LAURA: Does it take him a long time?

03:09:39.937 --> 03:09:41.527
SAM: Vecna gives up.

03:09:41.527 --> 03:09:42.807
JOE: Can I say one thing right now?

03:09:42.807 --> 03:09:44.116
MATT: Yes.

03:09:44.116 --> 03:09:57.861
JOE: As we were moving in the bubble, I cast
Animate Dead on Delilah and I raise her.

03:09:57.861 --> 03:10:01.295
TALIESIN: You're doing what?

03:10:01.295 --> 03:10:03.501
SAM: We're fighting her again!

03:10:03.501 --> 03:10:10.806
MATT: As you look out, you can see the mist, and
the mist vanishes, and you can see now, looking

03:10:10.806 --> 03:10:18.645
up, dozens and dozens of gloomstalkers have all
turned to see this out-in-the-open action that's

03:10:18.645 --> 03:10:25.578
now taking place in the space around you. You are
all out, not being stealthy, firing and shooting

03:10:25.578 --> 03:10:31.820
out into the air, and you see now, clusters of
these things heading in your direction. As you

03:10:31.820 --> 03:10:39.206
turn and look to the side, you watch as Delilah's
body gets up from the ground.

03:10:39.206 --> 03:10:42.467
JOE: Rise, and kneel before your master!

03:10:42.467 --> 03:10:47.516
MATT: As the shambling corpse of Delilah falls to
her knees before Arkhan--

03:10:47.516 --> 03:10:51.905
JOE: Oathbreaker, baby!

03:10:51.905 --> 03:11:04.044
MATT: As the realization begins of what is coming
at you. Two you could handle, maybe. There's a lot

03:11:04.044 --> 03:11:08.120
in your direction. You have revealed your
position, the wall was already destroyed and

03:11:08.120 --> 03:11:15.352
everything is swarming in your direction. As you
all begin to turn around, you hear this deafening

03:11:15.352 --> 03:11:25.403
roar from the sky above you. You glance up to see
a flash of brass light as Devo'ssa comes swooping

03:11:25.403 --> 03:11:35.464
into the barrier. Behind, a hundred or more Wyvern
Riders, risen from Vasselheim to join the rest of

03:11:35.464 --> 03:11:44.067
the brigade come swarming in and collide with the
gloomstalkers. You now see a frantic dog-fight

03:11:44.067 --> 03:11:48.419
cluster as hundreds of one and hundreds of the
other begin slamming into each other, tearing each

03:11:48.419 --> 03:11:54.698
other apart. You see blades swing, you see arrows
going flying and Devo'ssa begins to do sweeping

03:11:54.698 --> 03:11:59.759
rounds, back and forth across the sky. You realise
if there is a moment to move with the distraction,

03:11:59.759 --> 03:12:01.343
it's now.

03:12:01.343 --> 03:12:03.609
JOE: I load Delilah on the back.

03:12:03.609 --> 03:12:07.199
TALIESIN: I grab her wand.

03:12:07.199 --> 03:12:11.168
MARISHA: And her holy symbol that fell to the
ground.

03:12:11.168 --> 03:12:13.115
LAURA: Whatever that sparking thing was.

03:12:13.115 --> 03:12:16.534
MATT: The glowing sparkle light in it is inert
now.

03:12:16.534 --> 03:12:18.059
MARISHA: Is what? Inert?

03:12:18.059 --> 03:12:21.752
TALIESIN: It was the controller. So we have it.

03:12:21.752 --> 03:12:23.888
LAURA: We book it towards the tower. Right?

03:12:23.888 --> 03:12:27.857
MATT: You guys begin bolting your way towards
Entropis with its large funnel-like cloud

03:12:27.857 --> 03:12:32.228
encircling the top of its spire. And we're going
to take a break.

03:12:32.228 --> 03:12:37.448
(cheering)

03:12:37.448 --> 03:12:39.754
TRAVIS: Y'all, we recruited dead Delilah!

03:12:39.754 --> 03:12:42.368
JOE: I want to find this dude!

03:12:42.368 --> 03:12:50.528
MARISHA: What a dick!

03:12:50.528 --> 03:12:55.544
MATT: We're going to take a quick break, because
we want to probably push to 11 tonight and then

03:12:55.544 --> 03:13:00.750
we're going to leave, so make a quick restroom
break, fast as we can, come back. See you guys

03:13:00.750 --> 03:13:01.854
here in just a minute.

03:13:01.854 --> 03:13:03.336
LAURA: At the break we're giving away--

03:13:03.336 --> 03:13:05.979
MARISHA: We're giving away things.

03:13:05.979 --> 03:13:07.250
TALIESIN: So many things!

03:13:07.250 --> 03:13:08.408
JOE: Jocks Machina!

03:13:08.408 --> 03:13:10.397
MARISHA: Yeah, actually, Max or Ryan, is there
stipulations on the shirt?

03:13:10.397 --> 03:13:12.399
TALIESIN: Nope.

03:13:12.399 --> 03:13:13.827
MARISHA: We'll figure it out!

03:13:13.827 --> 03:13:16.200
JOE: Hey Travis, go put this on.

03:13:16.200 --> 03:13:19.285
MATT: Okay guys, we'll see you here in a few
minutes.

03:13:19.285 --> 03:13:21.029
TALIESIN: Take the wrapper off! That's weird!

03:13:21.029 --> 03:35:07.003
[break]

03:35:07.104 --> 03:35:10.763
MATT: Welcome back. A little longer than I
anticipated, but that's fine. We're going to jump

03:35:10.763 --> 03:35:14.968
in here, but before we do that, the winners for
the Wyrmwood box, we have Zabando is the winner.

03:35:14.968 --> 03:35:27.468
For the Jocks Machina shirt, we have Alcyon299.
Congratulations! You get to join the very

03:35:27.468 --> 03:35:28.733
exclusive Jocks Machina club.

03:35:28.733 --> 03:35:30.162
TRAVIS: Testosterone poncho.

03:35:30.162 --> 03:35:33.102
JOE: Only five of these. The other's my trainer
Ron, who plays another goliath, and my brother

03:35:33.102 --> 03:35:37.803
Nick, who plays an elf ranger who was incinerated
by the fucking death knight!

03:35:37.803 --> 03:35:44.852
MATT: So. Bringing it back in. As you guys are
charging your way toward Entropis, running through

03:35:44.852 --> 03:35:52.392
the streets, you do the best you can to dodge in
and out of any sort of things that might catch

03:35:52.392 --> 03:35:57.316
your attention street-side. You see most of the
undead and various cultists have been filtering

03:35:57.420 --> 03:36:01.554
down beneath the city a while back, and you're not
entirely certain where they are at the moment. The

03:36:01.554 --> 03:36:06.323
few dregs there are around there, you guys easily
enough dodge around.

03:36:06.323 --> 03:36:13.482
Pushing forward, you see the Spire of Entropis
growing taller and taller, the closer and closer

03:36:13.482 --> 03:36:20.436
you get to it. As soon as you get to the base of
the spire, you look up and you can see the broken

03:36:20.436 --> 03:36:27.190
seams of the once-toppled tower, now held together
by the network of glowing, magical threads, like

03:36:27.190 --> 03:36:34.329
arcane veins, wrapping the tower and lending an
unsettling, organic nature to its visage. The

03:36:34.329 --> 03:36:40.434
exterior still stands, windowless, like an obelisk
of tyranny looming over the entirety of the city.

03:36:40.434 --> 03:36:48.060
The apex, of course, is now obscured by shadow and
cloud, this slow-spinning tornado of twilight

03:36:48.060 --> 03:36:55.785
darkness entwining the top, blocking visibility,
and possibly entry, at the top. Numerous

03:36:55.785 --> 03:37:01.020
gloomstalkers encircle the higher level, not
currently engaging in the main fray, which is

03:37:01.020 --> 03:37:07.125
chaos all around. You see more emerging from this
cloud, almost seemingly creating them.

03:37:07.125 --> 03:37:18.888
The large front doors of the tower appear somewhat
ajar and open. There is one rot behemoth currently

03:37:18.888 --> 03:37:25.124
standing in front of this door. Vox Machina, what
do you want to do?

03:37:25.124 --> 03:37:31.103
TRAVIS: I don't want to overthink this, but I feel
like the sword said that it wanted to cut the webs

03:37:31.103 --> 03:37:36.539
of Vecna. Can I just cut the tower down?

03:37:36.539 --> 03:37:39.408
LAURA: I don't know if that's--

03:37:39.408 --> 03:37:41.423
TRAVIS: I take your laugh as a sign of--

03:37:41.423 --> 03:37:46.153
SAM: I don't know if you can cut the whole tower
down. They'll probably try to stop you. Don't you think?

03:37:46.153 --> 03:37:48.357
ASHLEY: You could certainly try.

03:37:48.357 --> 03:37:49.542
TRAVIS: I could, couldn't I?

03:37:49.542 --> 03:37:50.676
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:37:50.676 --> 03:37:51.758
TRAVIS: Perhaps not.

03:37:51.758 --> 03:38:00.077
LAURA: I feel like, do we see any other doors,
like, secret doors, maybe?

03:38:00.077 --> 03:38:01.627
SAM: Do we see invisible doors?

03:38:01.627 --> 03:38:06.821
MATT: Perception, glancing around, you don't see
anything. It looks like this is &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; door,

03:38:06.821 --> 03:38:09.956
entrance, to it. You could make an investigation
check, but you'd have to get up against the wall

03:38:09.956 --> 03:38:11.530
and carefully check it.

03:38:11.530 --> 03:38:14.300
LAURA: Can I do that without letting the rot
behemoth see me?

03:38:14.300 --> 03:38:17.308
MATT: You can certainly try.

03:38:17.308 --> 03:38:20.233
TRAVIS: That's a big fat no!

03:38:20.233 --> 03:38:22.882
MATT: You can certainly try. It's not a no.

03:38:22.882 --> 03:38:27.038
LIAM: But we're directly in front of the door a
ways back? How far back?

03:38:27.038 --> 03:38:30.917
MATT: You're about 40 feet away from it, off to
the side, glancing over where you can see the rot

03:38:30.917 --> 03:38:32.652
behemoth looming in the archway.

03:38:32.652 --> 03:38:35.862
LAURA: We didn't really think about how we were
getting up the tower, did we?

03:38:35.862 --> 03:38:42.636
JOE: Here's a possibility. I have a gloomstalker
and I have Delilah. I put her on the back of this

03:38:42.636 --> 03:38:45.073
thing and fly it up there, maybe this thing moves
out of the way.

03:38:45.073 --> 03:38:48.534
LAURA: Maybe the rot behemoth moves?

03:38:48.534 --> 03:38:49.717
JOE: I'm just saying.

03:38:49.717 --> 03:38:52.869
SAM: Can she talk? Can you make her talk?

03:38:52.869 --> 03:38:56.818
JOE: I don't think I can puppet her. I can tell
her to do commands.

03:38:56.818 --> 03:38:58.421
LAURA: Can you tell her to talk?

03:38:58.421 --> 03:39:01.789
JOE: She'll understand what I'm saying, but I
don't think she can--

03:39:01.789 --> 03:39:08.700
MATT: By the way, as you've made this journey
forward and Delilah's been shambling behind, you

03:39:08.700 --> 03:39:13.461
know, sitting behind you, this strange pain has
been hitting you in the back of your shoulders.

03:39:13.461 --> 03:39:20.341
You glance back and look at the corpse of Delilah
behind you as a rapidly growing tree is protruding

03:39:20.341 --> 03:39:24.845
and growing out of the chest of the corpse, and is
now setting weight off of the top of the

03:39:24.845 --> 03:39:27.832
gloomstalker as it's trying to flutter up behind
the party.

03:39:27.832 --> 03:39:31.872
LAURA: Sorry, sorry, that's a thing.

03:39:31.872 --> 03:39:35.960
JOE: Can I Cleansing Touch and end one spell?

03:39:35.960 --> 03:39:46.926
MATT: It's less of a spell effect and more of a
divine seed that was placed inside her body when

03:39:46.926 --> 03:39:48.669
she was slain by the Vestige, Fenthras.

03:39:48.669 --> 03:39:51.612
LAURA: I placed my seed inside of her.

03:39:51.612 --> 03:39:52.795
TALIESIN: And it quickened.

03:39:52.795 --> 03:39:54.167
MATT: Don't make it weird.

03:39:54.167 --> 03:39:56.422
LAURA: I make everything weird, Matt.

03:39:56.422 --> 03:39:59.635
JOE: I'm not going to further question you about
that.

03:39:59.635 --> 03:40:00.851
SAM: You knocked her up.

03:40:00.851 --> 03:40:05.993
JOE: Yeah, okay, must be an elf thing. That's
interesting. Very interesting, okay, great.

03:40:05.993 --> 03:40:11.335
SAM: Maybe they'll think that it's just a fashion
thing, and they'll let her through.

03:40:11.335 --> 03:40:15.886
MATT: It's still growing, and it's now protruding
about four feet from her chest. The body is now

03:40:15.886 --> 03:40:18.005
starting to get a little top-heavy.

03:40:18.005 --> 03:40:21.471
LAURA: Just chop the tree down! It's a thin tree.

03:40:21.471 --> 03:40:25.052
MATT: Yeah, it's not very thick. It's maybe
about-- Okay, so you take a couple hacks at it and

03:40:25.052 --> 03:40:28.253
eventually you manage to cut away the tree. Now
there's a trunk that's now stopped growing, about

03:40:28.253 --> 03:40:34.266
a foot out of Delilah's chest, with roots that
have taken root up into the shoulders and the chest.

03:40:34.266 --> 03:40:37.215
LAURA: That's sick. It's like she's got a built-in
shield now.

03:40:37.215 --> 03:40:40.532
TRAVIS: Can I take one of the fancy robes that
remains in the Bag of Holding and drape it over

03:40:40.532 --> 03:40:44.194
the trunk coming out of her chest, so it's a
little more hidden?

03:40:44.194 --> 03:40:45.283
MATT: Sure.

03:40:45.283 --> 03:40:47.352
LAURA: Now it looks like she's pregnant!

03:40:47.352 --> 03:40:52.422
SAM: I need a house. Can I take her branches and
make one?

03:40:52.422 --> 03:40:54.514
MATT: A house?

03:40:54.514 --> 03:40:57.259
SAM: Oh, it's The Giving Tree.

03:40:57.259 --> 03:40:58.931
(groaning)

03:40:58.931 --> 03:40:59.764
LAURA: That's terrible.

03:40:59.764 --> 03:41:01.052
(something clanks on the floor)

03:41:01.052 --> 03:41:02.183
LAURA: Oh! What was that?

03:41:02.183 --> 03:41:07.204
MATT: You have this rot behemoth at the entryway.
What are you guys doing?

03:41:07.204 --> 03:41:10.319
LIAM: Well, our options are somehow flying up or
going in the front door.

03:41:10.319 --> 03:41:16.428
LAURA: Do we fly up, or do we go inside and up the
tower? I'm sure there's no traps or horrible

03:41:16.428 --> 03:41:18.600
things on the inside of it.

03:41:18.600 --> 03:41:23.386
MARISHA: Last time, Pike and I took it down with a
couple of Earthquake spells.

03:41:23.386 --> 03:41:25.828
TALIESIN: But that didn't help nearly as much as
we thought it would.

03:41:25.828 --> 03:41:31.616
MARISHA: I mean, we didn't have to go up the damn
thing, so maybe check yourself before you say things.

03:41:31.616 --> 03:41:34.031
SAM: Let's just charge in. This is a fricking
giant, right? We've killed giants.

03:41:34.031 --> 03:41:37.509
TRAVIS: Behemoth. Is it dead? Undead?

03:41:37.509 --> 03:41:38.925
MATT: The rot behemoth? It's undead.

03:41:38.925 --> 03:41:41.393
JOE: It's undead? How big is a rot behemoth?

03:41:41.393 --> 03:41:48.945
MATT: The rot behemoth is about 12 feet tall or
so. Just a mass of stitched-together undead flesh.

03:41:48.945 --> 03:41:51.723
JOE: Medium, or large?

03:41:51.723 --> 03:41:52.765
MATT: Large.

03:41:52.765 --> 03:41:56.644
TALIESIN: I've got an idea. Can I borrow some of
that infinite rope?

03:41:56.644 --> 03:41:57.626
LAURA: Of course.

03:41:57.626 --> 03:42:01.778
TALIESIN: All right. I'm taking the infinite rope,
and I'm tying it around my little gem that I have.

03:42:01.778 --> 03:42:05.796
LAURA: The little blue gem?

03:42:05.796 --> 03:42:07.740
TALIESIN: My little glowing gem.

03:42:07.740 --> 03:42:11.731
MARISHA: Are you going to do that $20 bill trick
in New York City, thing?

03:42:11.731 --> 03:42:17.310
TALIESIN: More or less. Are we all agreed?

03:42:17.310 --> 03:42:19.559
LAURA: I love it, I love it!

03:42:19.559 --> 03:42:21.172
TRAVIS: If it doesn't work, we kill it.

03:42:21.172 --> 03:42:23.613
LAURA: Yeah, we'll drag it out of the doorway so
we can kill it!

03:42:23.613 --> 03:42:28.478
TALIESIN: Well, I'm going to make it move away,
and then once we're in I'm going to yank--

03:42:28.478 --> 03:42:33.944
LIAM: I used to do this with string and a G.I. Joe
for my cat when I was a kid. She loved it. I'm

03:42:33.944 --> 03:42:35.669
sure the rot behemoth will too.

03:42:35.669 --> 03:42:39.504
MATT: Okay, so. You take the pulse stone, you tie
it around--

03:42:39.504 --> 03:42:46.544
TALIESIN: I tie it around in a monkey fist knot. I
toss it about 20 feet away. I'm going to give it a

03:42:46.544 --> 03:42:53.893
throw. I'm going to throw it about 20 feet away
from the-- We're all in agreement of this plan?

03:42:53.893 --> 03:42:55.320
SAM: This is the best plan.

03:42:55.320 --> 03:42:59.365
LIAM: Wait, one second. Do we want to lure it into
a house and all of us be waiting to gank the shit

03:42:59.365 --> 03:43:00.886
out of it?

03:43:00.886 --> 03:43:05.042
TALIESIN: Well, technically, wait, hold on.

03:43:05.042 --> 03:43:12.979
MATT: You see a flash and a flare in the sky above
you. You see a cluster of gloomstalkers immolated

03:43:12.979 --> 03:43:17.611
by a burst of flame breath from Devo'ssa, who's
now up in the stratosphere. At this same time, you

03:43:17.611 --> 03:43:23.541
see about a dozen or so wyvern riders go riding
into this slow, spinning storm and get

03:43:23.541 --> 03:43:26.657
disintegrated into pieces.

03:43:26.657 --> 03:43:31.452
TALIESIN: I'm actually going to throw the gem,
then, past the stone giant, into the room. Just a

03:43:31.452 --> 03:43:33.649
little bit so that anything in the room--

03:43:33.649 --> 03:43:35.946
MATT: Make a strength check for me. That's a bit
of a lob.

03:43:35.946 --> 03:43:39.008
TALIESIN: Okay. Nine?

03:43:39.008 --> 03:43:44.113
MATT: It makes it about the 20 feet you intended
to. (clattering)

03:43:44.113 --> 03:43:47.543
LAURA: Pull it back and we'll have one of the-- I
mean, not that you're not strong and very--

03:43:47.543 --> 03:43:49.463
MATT: So what was the range on this Pulse Stone?

03:43:49.463 --> 03:43:52.780
TALIESIN: 30 feet.

03:43:52.780 --> 03:43:54.671
MATT: Okay, it is within range to affect the rot
behemoth.

03:43:54.671 --> 03:43:57.947
TALIESIN: Okay. I have to roll, though. I have to
do a roll to see if it survived the throw.

03:43:57.947 --> 03:43:59.218
MATT: That's true, yeah.

03:43:59.218 --> 03:44:03.968
TALIESIN: Yeah. It's fine.

03:44:03.968 --> 03:44:08.573
MATT: Tink, tink! It's a will save for the rot
behemoth.

03:44:08.573 --> 03:44:11.746
TALIESIN: DC 15.

03:44:11.746 --> 03:44:19.666
MATT: Wisdom? That's a two. No. You guys watch as
the rot behemoth, the stone, (clattering), its

03:44:19.666 --> 03:44:29.785
metal-armored face and glowing coal eyes turn
(heavy footsteps) and walks over to the gem and

03:44:29.785 --> 03:44:31.542
stares at it.

03:44:31.542 --> 03:44:37.515
TALIESIN: Let's all go in, shall we? And I'm going
to walk around it and stealth in.

03:44:37.515 --> 03:44:43.164
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace is still fucking up,
if it's been less than an hour.

03:44:43.164 --> 03:44:46.760
MATT: Make a concentration check for me, real
fast. Make a constitution saving throw.

03:44:46.760 --> 03:44:49.535
LIAM: We just watched the wyverns get obliterated
trying to fly into the swirl at the top.

03:44:49.535 --> 03:44:52.803
LAURA: I got 18.

03:44:52.803 --> 03:44:56.521
MATT: Okay, you maintain the concentration.
Referring to the blast from the skeletal dragon,

03:44:56.521 --> 03:45:01.332
earlier on. All right. So. Did you guys all roll
stealth?

03:45:01.417 --> 03:45:03.263
SAM: Stealth? Oh shit.

03:45:03.263 --> 03:45:05.009
LAURA: Plus ten!

03:45:05.009 --> 03:45:06.230
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

03:45:06.230 --> 03:45:07.741
MARISHA: Wait, stealth?

03:45:07.741 --> 03:45:10.249
SAM: I rolled a two and a two, so that's 15 and
15.

03:45:10.249 --> 03:45:15.881
JOE: How do I do this on this gloomstalker, with
the zombie? How does this work?

03:45:15.881 --> 03:45:29.685
MATT: Zombie's not stealthed, but it is undead.
Gloomstalker, it's hard to be stealthed, that

03:45:29.685 --> 03:45:31.049
gloomstalker, right now.

03:45:31.049 --> 03:45:32.527
SAM: We're going inside, we don't need it
anymore!

03:45:32.527 --> 03:45:33.606
JOE: Want me to leave it?

03:45:33.606 --> 03:45:38.203
SAM: I mean, what are you going to do with a
flying thing in a narrow stairway? We've seen

03:45:38.203 --> 03:45:41.675
inside, we scryed inside. It's a very narrow
stairway going up.

03:45:41.675 --> 03:45:46.030
LAURA: Can you have him climb up the side of the
tower and meet you up top?

03:45:46.030 --> 03:45:52.189
SAM: Oh yeah, meet us up top? (under his breath)
He ain't going to survive that.

03:45:52.189 --> 03:45:54.028
LAURA: Well, we can try it though.

03:45:54.028 --> 03:45:55.004
TRAVIS: He might.

03:45:55.004 --> 03:45:56.301
JOE: Yeah, I think that would work.

03:45:56.301 --> 03:45:57.559
MATT: Okay, you can do that.

03:45:57.559 --> 03:45:58.703
JOE: I hate it when you do that!

03:45:58.703 --> 03:46:02.030
LIAM: I mean, I love it, but I hate it.

03:46:02.030 --> 03:46:07.559
TALIESIN: Also, double checking-- grit is a reset
after combat, not a reset after a short rest?

03:46:07.559 --> 03:46:09.264
MATT: No, it's a short rest.

03:46:09.264 --> 03:46:10.450
TALIESIN: Short rest? Okay, just checking.

03:46:10.450 --> 03:46:15.103
JOE: I have the wreath back on my neck, correct?
Because that's how it works, I put it back on my

03:46:15.103 --> 03:46:16.702
neck once we're attuned?

03:46:16.702 --> 03:46:21.457
MATT: Yeah, you put it back on your neck once
you've-- correct.

03:46:21.457 --> 03:46:23.819
JOE: Okay. They, meet us at the top!

03:46:23.819 --> 03:46:28.833
MATT: Okay, as you step off and look into its
eyes, your eyes flare the bright yellow color and

03:46:28.833 --> 03:46:34.434
the gloomstalker nods, takes a step back, and then
leaps onto the side of the tower, its claws

03:46:34.434 --> 03:46:39.152
gripping in. As it bats its wings, it takes off
and starts heading upward.

03:46:39.152 --> 03:46:41.352
JOE: Circle at the top and wait for my command!

03:46:41.352 --> 03:46:45.620
MATT: It seems to acknowledge your command.

03:46:45.620 --> 03:46:48.479
JOE: All right, now at disadvantage, rolling in
heavy plate.

03:46:48.479 --> 03:46:49.963
TRAVIS: You got it.

03:46:49.963 --> 03:46:57.277
JOE: Do I have a plus ten? Sweet. Yeah, I got
this. All right. Nine, 27.

03:46:57.277 --> 03:47:02.066
MATT: Okay, so. 27. Two and two, 15, 15. Natural
20.

03:47:02.066 --> 03:47:03.393
MARISHA: 29.

03:47:03.393 --> 03:47:06.022
LIAM: Oh, it was a one, but it's a 37 now.

03:47:06.022 --> 03:47:07.406
LAURA: Because you rolled a luck? What?

03:47:07.406 --> 03:47:10.930
LIAM: No, Matt told me that, because of reliable
talent, one means shit.

03:47:10.930 --> 03:47:12.983
MATT: He always has a ten minimum.

03:47:12.983 --> 03:47:15.583
LAURA: That's fucking badass! 37.

03:47:15.583 --> 03:47:19.126
ASHLEY: 21.

03:47:19.126 --> 03:47:20.669
TRAVIS: 22.

03:47:20.669 --> 03:47:25.333
MATT: All right. So as you guys all dart in around
this rot behemoth, who pays no mind to your

03:47:25.333 --> 03:47:33.843
presence, you dart into the partially ajar doorway
into the base of Entropis, the tower itself. It's

03:47:33.843 --> 03:47:39.463
dark inside. As soon as you all dart into the
interior, the doors are still partially open and

03:47:39.463 --> 03:47:45.547
you can see the faint glow of the very low general
light that encompasses the city of Thar Amphala.

03:47:45.547 --> 03:47:53.905
The normal greenish-blue glow of the shield is
offset a little bit by the natural light that's

03:47:53.905 --> 03:47:57.743
coming through from the opening of the barrier
that you guys have opened. However, the light

03:47:57.743 --> 03:48:03.274
still diminishes as you step into this large
chamber. As soon as you enter the chamber, those

03:48:03.274 --> 03:48:12.268
of you with darkvision glance around and see, it's
a big thoroughfare. You see a large foyer-type

03:48:12.268 --> 03:48:21.376
chamber with pillars that go from bottom to maybe
25, 30 feet up, to a ceiling. Across the way, you

03:48:21.376 --> 03:48:29.325
can see two spiral staircases that curl upward and
there, maybe, 30 or so humanoid figures that are

03:48:29.325 --> 03:48:31.675
in the center of this chamber.

03:48:31.675 --> 03:48:33.500
SAM: What are they doing?

03:48:33.500 --> 03:48:40.868
MATT: Well, as soon as you guys step and turn
around, they all turn and look at you and begin

03:48:40.868 --> 03:48:42.804
to-- (sluggish footsteps).

03:48:42.804 --> 03:48:44.056
LAURA: We need that orb.

03:48:44.056 --> 03:48:47.255
TALIESIN: Once they're within range of us, I'm
going to wait.

03:48:47.255 --> 03:48:49.526
MATT: I mean, a lot of them are going to be right
up on you, right now.

03:48:49.526 --> 03:48:54.351
JOE: Can I sense what kind they are? Divine Sense,
tell what type of fiend, celestial, or undead they are?

03:48:54.351 --> 03:49:00.481
MATT: They are undead. They appear to be mostly of
the baseline skeletal or zombie variety. It's a

03:49:00.481 --> 03:49:02.619
cluster of undead that are set here.

03:49:02.619 --> 03:49:12.017
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to tug on the rope and
pull it up and toss the gem right smack-dab in the

03:49:12.017 --> 03:49:17.800
center of us. Unless somebody else wants to throw
it. Eh, it doesn't matter. I just yanked it.

03:49:17.800 --> 03:49:21.750
MATT: Okay, you yank it. Go ahead and make a roll.
See if it's destroyed or not.

03:49:21.750 --> 03:49:23.157
TALIESIN: Nope, it's good.

03:49:23.157 --> 03:49:27.929
MATT: All right. The stone (clattering) arcs in
the center. The blue pulse-glow light billows out.

03:49:27.929 --> 03:49:33.151
You see the various skeletons and zombies charge
into the light. They stop and stare at it. Let's see.

03:49:33.151 --> 03:49:34.662
TALIESIN: DC 15.

03:49:34.662 --> 03:49:35.955
LIAM: 30 rolls.

03:49:35.955 --> 03:49:41.654
SAM: Pike, can't you kill masses of undead?

03:49:41.654 --> 03:49:48.142
MATT: Okay, so of the 30 or so, about 20 of them
stop and stare at the glow while you hear a

03:49:48.142 --> 03:49:50.725
bounding, heavy footfall sound behind where you
came from.

03:49:50.725 --> 03:49:55.391
TALIESIN: He was not still within range?

03:49:55.391 --> 03:50:01.714
MATT: No, you pulled the stone from where you
were, inside the chamber now, so he's now rushing

03:50:01.714 --> 03:50:03.308
in after where the stone went.

03:50:03.308 --> 03:50:05.161
LIAM: This'll still work. Spread, and let him run
right into the range of it?

03:50:05.161 --> 03:50:07.404
LAURA: Oh, we can get out of the way and let him
maybe run into the undead that are--

03:50:07.404 --> 03:50:09.157
LIAM: As soon as he enters he's in range, isn't
he?

03:50:09.157 --> 03:50:14.163
MATT: Possibly. Up to you guys. But technically,
undead are still rushing in toward you and they're

03:50:14.163 --> 03:50:19.854
immediately scrambling, with their claws and
teeth, out there. Let's say, for the people at

03:50:19.854 --> 03:50:26.811
front here, it's going to be probably the two of
you who first made it in, so three attacks against

03:50:26.811 --> 03:50:31.062
each of you. That is an 18 against you, Vax.

03:50:31.062 --> 03:50:32.101
LIAM: No.

03:50:32.101 --> 03:50:34.516
MATT: That is a 20 against you.

03:50:34.516 --> 03:50:37.149
LIAM: No.

03:50:37.149 --> 03:50:42.651
MATT: No, that misses. Three against you. Natural
20. A 20.

03:50:42.651 --> 03:50:45.400
LAURA: No.

03:50:45.537 --> 03:50:48.452
MATT: And a natural one. All right, so while they
scramble at you and you push them back at bay, one

03:50:48.452 --> 03:50:54.005
of them does manage to get through. It's going to
be 12 points of slashing damage against you, Vex,

03:50:54.072 --> 03:50:57.840
as one of them swings at you with a rusty blade
that carves past you.

03:50:57.840 --> 03:50:59.642
LAURA: Okay.

03:50:59.642 --> 03:51:01.902
MATT: All right. What are you guys doing?

03:51:01.902 --> 03:51:09.140
ASHLEY: How many of them? About 30?

03:51:09.140 --> 03:51:11.537
MATT: About 30 of them, yeah.

03:51:11.537 --> 03:51:13.991
LIAM: Pickle, can you release a Sarenrae bomb?

03:51:13.991 --> 03:51:21.760
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll take out my Mace of Disruption.
I don't want to use any more spells.

03:51:21.760 --> 03:51:25.508
MATT: You have your Channel Divinity, your turn
undead. Or destroy undead.

03:51:25.508 --> 03:51:26.822
LAURA: Yeah, destroy undead.

03:51:26.822 --> 03:51:28.740
ASHLEY: Do I want to wait?

03:51:28.740 --> 03:51:30.493
LAURA: I don't know how many undead we're going to
face--

03:51:30.493 --> 03:51:35.058
LIAM: Vecna's going to be too powerful for a
destroy or turn undead. It's for weak-ass shit

03:51:35.058 --> 03:51:36.216
like this.

03:51:36.216 --> 03:51:38.940
LAURA: But he might have, you know, I don't know
what kind of army he's going to have up top, so

03:51:38.940 --> 03:51:40.073
it's up to you.

03:51:40.073 --> 03:51:41.792
ASHLEY: Well, I have another one.

03:51:41.792 --> 03:51:44.978
LAURA: So maybe do one of them?

03:51:44.978 --> 03:51:46.824
ASHLEY: So I can do it now, yeah.

03:51:46.824 --> 03:51:49.089
MATT: Okay, so as you rush in toward where this
Pulse Stone is, as the crowd of undead are

03:51:49.089 --> 03:51:54.336
gathered in, you hunker down, clutch your holy
symbol, and release a wave of divine energy, the

03:51:54.336 --> 03:52:02.488
whispers and prayer of Sarenrae emanating from you
like a caustic wave against undead energy. What's

03:52:02.488 --> 03:52:04.244
the DC on that?

03:52:04.244 --> 03:52:11.555
ASHLEY: It's not written down.

03:52:11.555 --> 03:52:14.418
MATT: It's your spell DC.

03:52:14.418 --> 03:52:15.524
LAURA: Oh, 18.

03:52:15.524 --> 03:52:16.654
MATT: Okay, 18.

03:52:16.654 --> 03:52:35.960
SAM: Wisdom, intelligence, or charisma.

03:52:35.960 --> 03:52:37.331
LIAM: Wisdom for clerics.

03:52:37.331 --> 03:52:38.824
SAM: Has your wisdom gone up at all?

03:52:38.824 --> 03:52:44.223
LIAM: Eight, plus five, plus your proficiency
bonus. 14, 20.

03:52:44.223 --> 03:52:48.655
LAURA: You're at six proficiency bonus, now.
You're not at--

03:52:48.655 --> 03:52:50.957
ASHLEY: I am? I didn't know that.

03:52:50.957 --> 03:52:56.065
LAURA: So your DC is 19. Sorry, Matt.

03:52:56.065 --> 03:53:06.502
MATT: It's okay. I lost count. Even with their
saves, four undead survive. As the shock wave

03:53:06.502 --> 03:53:15.026
emanates out from you, you watch as about two
dozen of these various skeletons and zombies, many

03:53:15.026 --> 03:53:19.799
of which are grasping at you, turn to ash. One of
them, you see it reaching out toward you, you get

03:53:19.799 --> 03:53:24.194
a glimpse of it. You can see, this one's a fresher
corpse, one of the zombies. It has dirty blonde

03:53:24.194 --> 03:53:28.863
hair, a torn chin with stubble, and for a brief
minute you can see-- it has this gash in its

03:53:28.863 --> 03:53:32.919
stomach, a partially eaten arm. For a brief
minute, as it reaches out for you before the wave

03:53:32.919 --> 03:53:38.665
hits, you're like, "Aldor?" Turns to ash.

03:53:38.665 --> 03:53:40.558
MARISHA: Aldor?

03:53:40.558 --> 03:53:43.412
MATT: A member of the Slayer's Take. Once the
prized love of--

03:53:43.412 --> 03:53:45.010
SAM: Felicia Day!

03:53:45.010 --> 03:53:46.204
(gasping)

03:53:46.204 --> 03:53:47.109
LAURA: No!

03:53:47.109 --> 03:53:48.541
MARISHA: No, Aldor!

03:53:48.541 --> 03:53:49.460
SAM: Oh, no!

03:53:49.460 --> 03:53:55.385
MATT: As the flash expands, you glance around and
you see a withered gnome corpse has been reaching

03:53:55.385 --> 03:53:58.961
toward you. Mostly bald head in places. You
recognize, this is one of your companions, Grubby,

03:53:58.961 --> 03:54:01.456
before the wave hits and he turns to ash.

03:54:01.456 --> 03:54:04.999
SAM: You just killed two of our friends, Pike!

03:54:04.999 --> 03:54:06.825
LAURA: Don't do that to her!

03:54:06.825 --> 03:54:08.134
ASHLEY: Fuck off, I didn't know!

03:54:08.134 --> 03:54:14.679
MATT: All of these are long dead. As this burst of
energy hits and all of a sudden dust and ash fill

03:54:14.679 --> 03:54:16.133
the chamber around you--

03:54:16.133 --> 03:54:18.896
LAURA: Did it do anything to the rot behemoth
coming in?

03:54:18.896 --> 03:54:23.672
MATT: The rot behemoth behind-- what is the DC on
him?

03:54:23.672 --> 03:54:25.468
LIAM: Challenge rating of four or lower.

03:54:25.468 --> 03:54:28.367
MATT: Yeah, it's higher than a challenge rating
four, so it doesn't affect him at all. But the

03:54:28.367 --> 03:54:33.048
four of you, easy enough to cleave him down, but
we'll see if he's even affected by the stone. So

03:54:33.048 --> 03:54:42.743
the last four that are there, as they charge into
the stone, nope! None of them make their save, so

03:54:42.743 --> 03:54:48.773
the last four that are still there, all stop and
stare and glare at this stone in the center of the

03:54:48.773 --> 03:54:54.304
chamber. The rot behemoth comes looming in.
(crashing) What's the DC?

03:54:54.304 --> 03:54:55.622
TALIESIN: DC is 15.

03:54:55.622 --> 03:54:58.910
MATT: 14, does not make it. By one!

03:54:58.910 --> 03:55:02.217
LIAM: Don't worry, Matt. Your luck is coming
upstairs.

03:55:02.217 --> 03:55:08.422
MATT: That's true, that's true. So the rot
behemoth (crashing) through the door and then

03:55:08.422 --> 03:55:15.686
stays there, staring at the stone, blocking the
doorway and holding it in place. But now this

03:55:15.686 --> 03:55:16.851
chamber's open.

03:55:16.851 --> 03:55:18.274
LAURA: Should we kill this shit while we're
stunned?

03:55:18.274 --> 03:55:19.364
SAM: No, we should just run up!

03:55:19.364 --> 03:55:20.806
LAURA: How do we know we're not going to run into
a whole bunch more?

03:55:20.806 --> 03:55:22.970
TALIESIN: Which is why we're going to keep the
rope. We're going to go all the way up the stairs,

03:55:22.970 --> 03:55:25.324
and when we're ready, we're going to tug like a
motherfucker.

03:55:25.324 --> 03:55:29.917
LAURA: Okay, and then all these things are going
to chase after us?

03:55:29.917 --> 03:55:32.665
MATT: They'll keep following you. Every time you
pull the stone, they're going to come toward you.

03:55:32.665 --> 03:55:34.393
LAURA: So we might as well kill them now, while
they're stunned.

03:55:34.393 --> 03:55:36.352
TALIESIN: All right, one at a time. Let's kill one
at a time.

03:55:36.352 --> 03:55:39.848
SAM: The giant's going to take more than one hit.

03:55:39.848 --> 03:55:42.797
TALIESIN: Yeah, but we're going to get him.

03:55:42.797 --> 03:55:45.488
MATT: We'll say, easy enough for you guys to
coordinate. The skeletons are easy enough to

03:55:45.488 --> 03:55:56.455
destroy. The rot behemoth, all in one swoop, you
guys can take down as one quick blast on it. One

03:55:56.455 --> 03:56:01.607
of the skeletons, you also recognize: a heavily
charred zombie making a horrid sighing sound as

03:56:01.607 --> 03:56:04.219
it's sitting there, staring at the stone. You see
the remains of Vander.

03:56:04.219 --> 03:56:05.717
JOE: Is he damaged?

03:56:05.717 --> 03:56:08.809
MATT: Burnt to a cinder. The last thing you saw
was him being immolated and screaming.

03:56:08.809 --> 03:56:12.420
JOE: I'd like to Channel Divinity and Control
Undead.

03:56:12.420 --> 03:56:17.534
MATT: Okay. And with that, before you destroy the
zombie--

03:56:17.534 --> 03:56:20.017
JOE: It's a wisdom save.

03:56:20.017 --> 03:56:30.540
MATT: Wisdom save? Three. Nope. You've got two
zombies. Delilah and now your previous ally,

03:56:30.645 --> 03:56:34.306
Vander. Turns from the stone. (wheezing)

03:56:34.306 --> 03:56:35.801
JOE: This is fucking dark.

03:56:35.801 --> 03:56:39.296
TALIESIN: I'm really excited about the notion of a
Delilah potted plant.

03:56:39.296 --> 03:56:44.248
JOE: It's my brother's character from our home
group!

03:56:44.248 --> 03:56:47.446
LIAM: You are now Michonne, from Walking Dead. You
got two zombies.

03:56:47.446 --> 03:56:51.355
TRAVIS: Bring them into the CRU, you got them!

03:56:51.355 --> 03:57:01.559
JOE: Zombie Vander, aw man. This is like, rattling
whatever blackened heart my character has. Okay.

03:57:01.559 --> 03:57:05.090
LIAM: All right, well, up we go, then, yeah?

03:57:05.090 --> 03:57:06.338
TALIESIN: Let's do this.

03:57:06.338 --> 03:57:07.539
LIAM: I'm going to look for traps, as we go.

03:57:07.539 --> 03:57:08.923
MATT: All right, make an investigation check.

03:57:08.923 --> 03:57:11.057
SAM: Everyone all healed up to full?

03:57:11.057 --> 03:57:12.082
LAURA and MARISHA: No.

03:57:12.082 --> 03:57:14.488
SAM: Should we pause and heal, or--?

03:57:14.488 --> 03:57:15.876
LAURA: Pause for 30 minutes and heal?

03:57:15.876 --> 03:57:18.843
TRAVIS: Vasselheim was just out the window.

03:57:18.843 --> 03:57:21.499
LIAM: Two miles away, ish.

03:57:21.499 --> 03:57:22.656
MATT: What'd you roll?

03:57:22.656 --> 03:57:23.954
LIAM: 18.

03:57:23.954 --> 03:57:24.941
MATT: 18, okay.

03:57:24.941 --> 03:57:28.795
SAM: If you take a potion, you're full. Right?
Don't you have your thing going, or no, is that gone?

03:57:28.795 --> 03:57:30.956
TRAVIS: Beacon of Hope.

03:57:30.956 --> 03:57:36.530
LAURA: Beacon of Hope just means it heals the max
that a healing spell or a healing potion can do.

03:57:36.530 --> 03:57:38.721
You don't automatically go to full health.

03:57:38.721 --> 03:57:39.452
TRAVIS: 2d8, 16.

03:57:39.452 --> 03:57:41.314
SAM: Oh, I didn't know that.

03:57:41.314 --> 03:57:43.019
MATT: How long does Beacon of Hope last?

03:57:43.019 --> 03:57:46.732
LIAM: One minute.

03:57:46.732 --> 03:57:48.667
MATT: Beacon is gone.

03:57:48.667 --> 03:57:51.188
LAURA: That's okay. Do you have a healing spell
for people?

03:57:51.188 --> 03:57:52.419
ASHLEY: I do.

03:57:52.419 --> 03:57:56.087
TRAVIS: Are we doing a group thing right now?

03:57:56.087 --> 03:57:59.266
LIAM: Are we short resting or we doing little
healies?

03:57:59.266 --> 03:58:00.857
LAURA: I don't think we have 30 minutes.

03:58:00.857 --> 03:58:05.978
MARISHA: We need a full 30 minutes to do a quick
short rest?

03:58:05.978 --> 03:58:09.001
MATT: Technically it's a full hour, by the rules.
I let it slide a little faster in times of

03:58:09.001 --> 03:58:18.201
intensity. I'd allow a 30-minute quick rest, but
that's still--

03:58:18.201 --> 03:58:21.274
TALIESIN: I would not say no to it, but I can live
without it.

03:58:21.274 --> 03:58:24.733
LAURA: I don't know, I mean, they're fighting at
Vasselheim right now.

03:58:24.733 --> 03:58:26.652
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're at the gates.

03:58:26.652 --> 03:58:31.748
MARISHA: I'm at 94 hit points, I'm down about 50
or so hit points.

03:58:31.748 --> 03:58:36.490
LIAM: I'm telling you, though, it's this or
nothing. If we fall here, if we fail, then it's

03:58:36.490 --> 03:58:42.499
fucked, so even if it destroys half the city, it's
better to have all of us at full fighting

03:58:42.499 --> 03:58:43.362
potential.

03:58:43.362 --> 03:58:50.761
JOE: I would like to cast Death Ward on myself.
4th-level spell slot.

03:58:50.761 --> 03:58:52.010
MATT: Okay.

03:58:52.010 --> 03:58:53.598
TRAVIS: All right, do it. Do the short rest. Just
do it.

03:58:53.598 --> 03:58:57.110
SAM: Wait, we're doing a short rest? Wait, who
needs it?

03:58:57.110 --> 03:58:59.095
TALIESIN: We honestly all do.

03:58:59.095 --> 03:59:03.805
LAURA: We all need healing. I'm 40 points down.

03:59:03.805 --> 03:59:11.843
MARISHA: I'm 50 points down, and I burned both of
my shape change. Who else is down far?

03:59:11.843 --> 03:59:15.416
TRAVIS: A quarter, or half, of Vasselheim, is--

03:59:15.416 --> 03:59:18.118
SAM: Don't you have a healing spell?

03:59:18.118 --> 03:59:22.096
ASHLEY: I do, but it depends on the roll.

03:59:22.096 --> 03:59:26.001
SAM: No no, because it maximizes it.

03:59:26.001 --> 03:59:33.137
LAURA: No, we don't have it anymore.

03:59:33.137 --> 03:59:34.506
ASHLEY: Yeah, so if I roll bad, or--

03:59:34.506 --> 03:59:36.406
LIAM: No, but we have hit dice. You don't need the
spells.

03:59:36.406 --> 03:59:37.708
SAM: Bye, Vasselheim.

03:59:37.708 --> 03:59:39.917
MATT: All right, so you guys are taking a short
rest in the inside of Entropis?

03:59:39.917 --> 03:59:41.213
MARISHA: No, look, super short.

03:59:41.213 --> 03:59:44.304
MATT: There is no super-short rest. It's a short
rest.

03:59:44.304 --> 03:59:46.353
SAM: Seems terrible.

03:59:46.353 --> 03:59:49.506
MATT: Vasselheim was in sight when you were
outside.

03:59:49.506 --> 03:59:51.514
MARISHA: I don't know! What do you want?

03:59:51.514 --> 03:59:53.074
MATT: I'm just letting you know!

03:59:53.074 --> 03:59:56.317
SAM: We have potions! Can't we drink potions?

03:59:56.317 --> 04:00:01.034
JOE: Listen, you're not going to need the potions
after today. I'm just saying.

04:00:01.034 --> 04:00:04.331
LAURA: Might as well take them.

04:00:04.331 --> 04:00:05.615
TRAVIS: Don't take your superior, though.

04:00:05.615 --> 04:00:06.951
SAM: No, we have other ones, though.

04:00:06.951 --> 04:00:09.534
LAURA: Can you try healing and see what it does?

04:00:09.534 --> 04:00:14.260
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll do Mass Cure Wounds on you
guys.

04:00:14.260 --> 04:00:16.082
LAURA: What does that do?

04:00:16.082 --> 04:00:20.685
MARISHA: I don't know, but we also, we broke down
the barrier, so Vasselheim can defend itself a

04:00:20.685 --> 04:00:22.174
little more.

04:00:22.174 --> 04:00:24.083
TRAVIS: One-sixth of the pie.

04:00:24.083 --> 04:00:28.501
MARISHA: I'm 50 points down and without my beast
shape.

04:00:28.501 --> 04:00:29.779
LAURA: You don't have beast shape?

04:00:29.779 --> 04:00:34.202
MARISHA: I used it to go earth elemental, because
I thought the Briarwood fight might be a little

04:00:34.202 --> 04:00:39.777
bit more beefy than it was. But I don't
necessarily need it.

04:00:39.777 --> 04:00:42.489
TRAVIS: Vote as a group. Hand up if you want a
short rest.

04:00:42.489 --> 04:00:44.070
SAM: No.

04:00:44.070 --> 04:00:49.632
TRAVIS: No hands? Just put your hand up if you
want it.

04:00:49.632 --> 04:00:52.436
TALIESIN: I will admit, it would do a lot for me.

04:00:52.436 --> 04:00:53.757
TRAVIS: Keyleth, put your hand up.

04:00:53.757 --> 04:00:54.983
LIAM: I'm going to put up because I think that
these two need it.

04:00:54.983 --> 04:00:56.425
TRAVIS: I'll tie-break it.

04:00:56.425 --> 04:00:58.365
LAURA: So short rest? Short rest. Okay.

04:00:58.365 --> 04:00:59.787
SAM: Vasselheim.

04:00:59.787 --> 04:01:06.483
MARISHA: To quote the leaders of Vasselheim, "They
have defended themselves through many forms of battle."

04:01:06.483 --> 04:01:10.903
JOE: That vampire's going to be up there, full
strength. He's going to be back. He's going to be

04:01:10.903 --> 04:01:12.171
back full strength.

04:01:12.171 --> 04:01:13.431
LAURA: He might not be back full strength yet!

04:01:13.431 --> 04:01:14.435
JOE: He'll be back something.

04:01:14.435 --> 04:01:15.868
LAURA: He takes a while to rest up.

04:01:15.868 --> 04:01:17.273
JOE: It's 25 a minute, isn't it?

04:01:17.273 --> 04:01:18.913
TRAVIS: It's super fast.

04:01:18.913 --> 04:01:26.099
MATT: He regenerates 25-- Well, there's a lot of
things at work here. It depends. Roll a religion check.

04:01:26.099 --> 04:01:29.347
TRAVIS: Natural one.

04:01:29.347 --> 04:01:31.138
TALIESIN: I'll try a religion check.

04:01:31.138 --> 04:01:39.798
JOE: I'm a paladin with terrible religion skills.
Blind faith.

04:01:39.798 --> 04:01:45.305
MATT: All right, but still roll a religion check.
Seeing as how undead is your domain.

04:01:45.305 --> 04:01:46.976
LIAM: Just roll a natural 20, Joe.

04:01:46.976 --> 04:01:48.218
JOE: I rolled a natural 18.

04:01:48.218 --> 04:01:50.104
MATT: Plus?

04:01:50.104 --> 04:01:53.158
JOE: Zero, for religion.

04:01:53.158 --> 04:02:00.664
MATT: Okay, okay. You know this because of your
experience with undead and amassing yourself a

04:02:00.664 --> 04:02:09.101
necromantic energy since breaking your oath long
ago. When a vampire is reduced to zero hit points

04:02:09.101 --> 04:02:14.903
and goes into mist form, it has two hours to
return to its resting place. When it reaches its

04:02:14.903 --> 04:02:21.457
resting place, it has to rest for one hour. Once
it rests for the one hour, it goes back to one hit

04:02:21.457 --> 04:02:25.804
point and then it regenerates 25 hit points, or at
least, Sylas, every single round.

04:02:25.804 --> 04:02:28.169
LIAM: Roughly how much time has passed since we
went from--?

04:02:28.169 --> 04:02:34.730
MATT: I'd say 30-ish minutes or so. 30 or 40,
because you've been slowly stealthing your way

04:02:34.730 --> 04:02:36.912
through, being careful.

04:02:36.912 --> 04:02:38.664
LIAM: Right right, but probably his box of dirt is
not--

04:02:38.664 --> 04:02:43.151
MATT: So if you take a short rest, you're probably
going to look at a Sylas waiting for you somewhere

04:02:43.151 --> 04:02:44.523
up top.

04:02:44.523 --> 04:02:47.699
LAURA: It's going to take two hours to get up the
tower?

04:02:47.699 --> 04:02:51.574
SAM: It's a big tower. There's lots of shit up
there.

04:02:51.574 --> 04:02:54.385
MATT: No, meaning, if you guys take a short rest,
he needs to rest for an hour. It took you 40

04:02:54.385 --> 04:02:58.524
minutes since that happened to get to the tower.
If you take a short rest, you're going to have to

04:02:58.524 --> 04:02:59.595
deal with a Sylas.

04:02:59.595 --> 04:03:02.638
TALIESIN: I mean fuck it, if we heal ourselves--

04:03:02.638 --> 04:03:05.825
SAM: Scanlan's got healing. Scanlan Two's got
healing. We can pump you guys up.

04:03:05.825 --> 04:03:08.227
TRAVIS: Because he also turns people, right?

04:03:08.227 --> 04:03:09.416
TALIESIN: He does turn people.

04:03:09.416 --> 04:03:11.106
TRAVIS: I barely made that save.

04:03:11.106 --> 04:03:12.770
LAURA: We need to not rest.

04:03:12.770 --> 04:03:17.200
TALIESIN: How much heal do you get out of a
potion?

04:03:17.200 --> 04:03:19.547
ASHLEY: Who's bad?

04:03:19.547 --> 04:03:21.636
MARISHA: I'm not great.

04:03:21.636 --> 04:03:24.176
ASHLEY: You're bad? Who else?

04:03:24.176 --> 04:03:27.511
JOE: I could use some, seeing that I have tank
duties.

04:03:27.511 --> 04:03:28.993
SAM: How many can you include?

04:03:28.993 --> 04:03:34.480
ASHLEY: Okay, is anybody down? I'm going to do
Prayer of Healing. I want to save Mass Cure Wounds.

04:03:34.480 --> 04:03:36.539
MARISHA: I'm at 94 hit points, so I'm down--

04:03:36.539 --> 04:03:39.114
JOE: I'm down 42, but I could probably heal--

04:03:39.114 --> 04:03:42.786
MATT: You could take a short rest, but understand
and be prepared with the knowledge of knowing that

04:03:42.786 --> 04:03:46.794
you're also going-- put some things in your
chamber that will be helpful against a vampire.

04:03:46.794 --> 04:03:52.086
SAM: Scanlan Two has tons of healing spells that
he can use, so use them. He's going to be dead

04:03:52.086 --> 04:03:54.006
soon anyway.

04:03:54.006 --> 04:03:59.187
MARISHA: You guys don't want us losing any of our
spellcasters right now. I'm at 94. It's not a lot,

04:03:59.187 --> 04:04:03.123
it's not bad, but it's bad enough. I'm a third of
my hit points down.

04:04:03.123 --> 04:04:08.380
MATT: You do have a battery of low-level spell
slots right now that can be used to heal things up

04:04:08.380 --> 04:04:09.848
if you want to.

04:04:09.848 --> 04:04:11.464
SAM: Yeah, I can heal you and heal you and heal
you until you're all done.

04:04:11.464 --> 04:04:15.105
MARISHA: Yeah, but every time you heal me and heal
me and heal me, it's taking away from something

04:04:15.105 --> 04:04:16.497
else mechanically.

04:04:16.497 --> 04:04:18.893
SAM: It's a level one bullshit spell slot.

04:04:18.893 --> 04:04:23.517
TALIESIN: But it's also healing that could be done
in combat. That's what we're meaning.

04:04:23.517 --> 04:04:25.950
MARISHA: I'm resigning my decision right now.

04:04:25.950 --> 04:04:34.636
MATT: Make a choice here, guys. You're wasting
time in the tower.

04:04:34.636 --> 04:04:41.170
SAM: No short rest! Heal some people, I'll heal
some more. We got this. We got lots of healing.

04:04:41.170 --> 04:04:44.522
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll just use a 2nd-level for 16
points of healing for six people who need it.

04:04:44.522 --> 04:04:45.613
SAM: Great!

04:04:45.613 --> 04:04:47.206
MARISHA: 16 points? I'll take that.

04:04:47.206 --> 04:04:48.458
LAURA: I'm taking one.

04:04:48.458 --> 04:04:49.491
SAM: I will take it as well.

04:04:49.491 --> 04:04:50.838
TALIESIN: How many people have taken it so far?

04:04:50.838 --> 04:04:55.498
SAM: You said up to six people? I'll take that.

04:04:55.498 --> 04:05:00.883
MARISHA: 110, I'm still 31 hit points down.

04:05:00.883 --> 04:05:06.440
SAM: I will cast Healing Word, or Scanlan Two will
cast Healing Word at 2nd-level for you.

04:05:06.440 --> 04:05:07.505
MARISHA: For me?

04:05:07.505 --> 04:05:08.884
SAM: Yeah. That's--

04:05:08.884 --> 04:05:11.265
MATT: You can use Cure Wounds as opposed to
Healing Word.

04:05:11.265 --> 04:05:12.562
SAM: I don't have Cure Wounds.

04:05:12.562 --> 04:05:14.087
MATT: Oh, that's right. Never mind.

04:05:14.087 --> 04:05:18.670
SAM: That's nine more points for you.

04:05:18.670 --> 04:05:20.050
MARISH: For me?

04:05:20.050 --> 04:05:21.781
SAM: Yeah. Oh, wait! I can sing a Song of Rest.

04:05:21.781 --> 04:05:24.481
MATT: That takes a short rest to do.

04:05:24.481 --> 04:05:25.703
SAM: Yeah. That makes sense.

04:05:25.703 --> 04:05:29.212
MARISHA: I could do my speech if I had a short
rest.

04:05:29.212 --> 04:05:31.378
LAURA: Well, you can do the speech as we climb up
the tower!

04:05:31.378 --> 04:05:35.616
JOE: How much are you short? She's 22 short?

04:05:35.616 --> 04:05:43.680
LAURA: The speech does what? Does the speech
regain hit points?

04:05:43.680 --> 04:05:45.700
MATT: Ten minutes to say the speech.

04:05:45.700 --> 04:05:47.412
LAURA: So as we climb the tower, she could be
saying it?

04:05:47.412 --> 04:05:48.704
MATT: Perhaps, yeah.

04:05:48.704 --> 04:05:51.902
SAM: I will heal you another 2nd-level healing
spell.

04:05:51.902 --> 04:05:54.842
LAURA: A Greater Healing Potion is 4d4?

04:05:54.842 --> 04:05:58.970
MATT: You've got it. 4d4 plus four.

04:05:58.970 --> 04:06:00.566
SAM: That's another 12 points.

04:06:00.566 --> 04:06:05.594
MATT: Consider now, as you guys climb the tower,
if you have any buff spells, if you have any

04:06:05.594 --> 04:06:13.203
long-lasting things that you want to utilize for
the coming fray. Freedom of Movement, Death Ward,

04:06:13.203 --> 04:06:15.495
all the things you guys want to prepare with,
now's the time to do it.

04:06:15.495 --> 04:06:16.861
MARISHA: 141, I'm full.

04:06:16.861 --> 04:06:20.783
LIAM: I'm going to, when we're right on the verge,
when we think we're right on the verge, I'm

04:06:20.783 --> 04:06:23.551
blessing you and you.

04:06:23.551 --> 04:06:24.950
TRAVIS: I think this is the verge.

04:06:24.950 --> 04:06:29.386
MARISHA: Is this the verge? Because if this is the
verge--

04:06:29.386 --> 04:06:31.673
MATT: You still have the tower to climb, but know,
if you have spells, like buffs, to cast that

04:06:31.673 --> 04:06:36.141
aren't concentration and last a while, now's the
time to do it.

04:06:36.141 --> 04:06:37.812
MARISHA: Like, an hour a while?

04:06:37.812 --> 04:06:43.693
JOE: Tiamat gave her 12. I'm going to give 18 to
myself out of my healing pool.

04:06:43.693 --> 04:06:49.009
MARISHA: Pike and I burn all of our 4th level
spell splots to do--

04:06:49.009 --> 04:06:50.200
ASHLEY: Splots!

04:06:50.200 --> 04:06:56.478
MARISHA: Splots! Do all of our spell splots! To
cast Freedom of Movement on anybody. With the

04:06:56.478 --> 04:07:00.940
exception of Percy, who already has it.

04:07:00.940 --> 04:07:02.296
JOE: What does Freedom of Movement do?

04:07:02.296 --> 04:07:03.371
MATT: Wait, how many slots is that for you guys,
then?

04:07:03.371 --> 04:07:04.311
MARISHA: Three each.

04:07:04.311 --> 04:07:05.259
MATT: Three each. Okay.

04:07:05.259 --> 04:07:06.485
MARISHA: Except, we didn't account for--

04:07:06.485 --> 04:07:09.674
SAM: Scanlan Two.

04:07:09.674 --> 04:07:10.942
MARISHA: Or Arkhan.

04:07:10.942 --> 04:07:12.399
JOE: What's happening?

04:07:12.399 --> 04:07:16.804
MATT: Okay. Anything else you want to buff with?

04:07:16.804 --> 04:07:19.764
LAURA: Yes, I'm going to invoke my Blessing of the
Dawnfather.

04:07:19.764 --> 04:07:21.435
MATT: Okay.

04:07:21.435 --> 04:07:26.510
MARISHA: Oh my god.

04:07:26.510 --> 04:07:27.862
MATT: No Death Wards?

04:07:27.862 --> 04:07:29.931
JOE: I did--

04:07:29.931 --> 04:07:32.530
MATT: You did Death Ward to yourself?

04:07:32.530 --> 04:07:34.160
TRAVIS: She has a Death Ward.

04:07:34.160 --> 04:07:36.114
ASHLEY: Wait a second. One of us is without
Freedom of Movement.

04:07:36.114 --> 04:07:40.372
LAURA: Scanlan Two.

04:07:40.372 --> 04:07:41.947
TALIESIN: I have it automatically.

04:07:41.947 --> 04:07:43.261
MARISHA: He has it automatically.

04:07:43.261 --> 04:07:44.411
ASHLEY: Understand.

04:07:44.411 --> 04:07:48.035
LAURA: Can anybody cast some Death Wards too?

04:07:48.035 --> 04:07:49.303
JOE: Wait, I didn't get Freedom of Movement?

04:07:49.303 --> 04:07:50.990
SAM, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: No.

04:07:50.990 --> 04:07:56.205
SAM: We did it with an earring. Sorry, you weren't
on.

04:07:56.205 --> 04:08:00.892
JOE: I'm over kicking a can in the corner.

04:08:00.892 --> 04:08:04.447
SAM: We're all on iPhones and you're on a Windows
phone.

04:08:04.447 --> 04:08:10.163
ASHLEY: I don't have another 4th-level, unless I
burn a 5th-level, for Death Ward.

04:08:10.163 --> 04:08:14.825
JOE: Now, I have some funky shit. I have a
Cleansing Touch, anyway, that can end a spell on

04:08:14.825 --> 04:08:19.165
me or any willing creature that I touch, so that
should help.

04:08:19.165 --> 04:08:22.247
MATT: So what's the plan, guys?

04:08:22.247 --> 04:08:23.663
SAM: Wait, we're doing things that last an hour?

04:08:23.663 --> 04:08:24.805
LAURA: We're doing things, yeah. We're doing it.

04:08:24.805 --> 04:08:25.753
SAM: Shit.

04:08:25.753 --> 04:08:30.687
MARISHA: I mean, I don't know-- Unless we want to
try and get higher up before we go.

04:08:30.687 --> 04:08:32.179
MATT: That's up to you guys.

04:08:32.179 --> 04:08:36.242
MARISHA: Do we think this is it? Are we sure this
is it?

04:08:36.242 --> 04:08:39.338
LIAM: Is it one of these guys where we can see the
height of the tower, or--?

04:08:39.338 --> 04:08:42.512
MATT: You can't see the height of the tower. It
goes up into another floor.

04:08:42.512 --> 04:08:47.781
MARISHA: Okay, so this means, anything we
encounter, if it's not fucking Vecna, then we're

04:08:47.781 --> 04:08:54.222
barreling through it and going straight up.
Because we've burned everything.

04:08:54.222 --> 04:08:57.534
MATT: If you want to hold your spells until you
get higher, I'll let you do that. Up to you.

04:08:57.534 --> 04:09:03.404
LIAM: There's a death knight.

04:09:03.404 --> 04:09:07.082
MARISHA: I don't know what's worth it. Do we have
any idea of how much higher this tower goes?

04:09:07.082 --> 04:09:08.556
MATT: I mean, it goes pretty high.

04:09:08.556 --> 04:09:12.186
LIAM: Oh, excuse me. Where is Vecna right now? How
high up?

04:09:12.186 --> 04:09:13.632
MATT: Right above you.

04:09:13.632 --> 04:09:15.505
LIAM: Right above us, way up, or a floor up?

04:09:15.505 --> 04:09:16.495
MATT: Way up.

04:09:16.495 --> 04:09:17.471
LIAM: Way up. Okay.

04:09:17.471 --> 04:09:20.040
MARISHA: Do we want to try and jog another ten
minutes before doing this?

04:09:20.040 --> 04:09:24.110
TALIESIN: Let's get halfway up the tower.

04:09:24.110 --> 04:09:27.505
MARISHA: Okay, okay. Before we burn everything--

04:09:27.505 --> 04:09:29.809
MATT: Just letting you guys be prepared here,
because you're Vox Machina.

04:09:29.809 --> 04:09:34.533
MARISHA: Okay, we're going to go ten more minutes
up and I'm going to give a speech as we go.

04:09:34.533 --> 04:09:37.628
LAURA: So I'm invoking the blessing as we get
closer.

04:09:37.628 --> 04:09:40.847
ASHLEY: Does anybody else want Death Ward?

04:09:40.847 --> 04:09:42.753
TALIESIN: No, I'm good.

04:09:42.753 --> 04:09:49.178
MARISHA: I say, okay, guys, as we climb this
tower, I know there's a lot of stairs, but the

04:09:49.178 --> 04:09:52.873
stairs are going to be fucking nothing compared to
Vecna. But holy fuck, these are a lot of fucking stairs.

04:09:52.873 --> 04:09:54.564
SAM: This is inspiring.

04:09:54.564 --> 04:09:56.392
TALIESIN: The stairs are a metaphor.

04:09:56.392 --> 04:10:03.460
MARISHA: The stairs are a metaphor. Each stair
that we get across is going to be like another

04:10:03.460 --> 04:10:11.087
step further into defeating Vecna. You know? With
each stair-- I'm winded.

04:10:11.087 --> 04:10:12.935
LAURA: The stairs are long, but they're not
infinite.

04:10:12.935 --> 04:10:18.027
MARISHA: The stairs are long, but they are not
infinite. Be good and now we're almost there,

04:10:18.027 --> 04:10:22.354
guys! We're almost there! This is it! This is it.
(sobbing and panting)

04:10:22.354 --> 04:10:24.231
LAURA: I feel so inspired, Keyleth. Thank you.

04:10:24.231 --> 04:10:27.157
SAM: Wow, that was so inspiring.

04:10:27.157 --> 04:10:31.508
MARISHA: This is it, you guys! Just keep going up
the stairs! And that's my speech.

04:10:31.508 --> 04:10:34.067
MATT: Okay, take your 17-- no, 19--

04:10:34.067 --> 04:10:35.357
MARISHA: 19 hit points.

04:10:35.357 --> 04:10:38.685
MATT: 19 temporary hit points. Including you.

04:10:38.685 --> 04:10:40.419
JOE: 19 temporary, yeah.

04:10:40.419 --> 04:10:41.731
MARISHA: And they're temporary, not--

04:10:41.731 --> 04:10:43.758
LAURA: In addition to our plus two, so now we have
21.

04:10:43.758 --> 04:10:47.004
MARISHA: Do we heal above that?

04:10:47.004 --> 04:10:52.070
MATT: Yeah. Well, you get temporary hit points,
like a buffer shield.

04:10:52.070 --> 04:10:55.095
MARISHA: Right, so those 19 go first.

04:10:55.095 --> 04:10:56.484
MATT: Correct. Okay.

04:10:56.484 --> 04:11:06.686
LAURA: Oh god, oh god, oh god. Okay, are we
getting near the top?

04:11:06.686 --> 04:11:11.025
JOE: Let me know, because I'm going to throw up.

04:11:11.025 --> 04:11:15.680
TRAVIS: Who wants the Death Ward?

04:11:15.680 --> 04:11:18.021
MARISHA: Yeah, and Pike and I cast whenever seems
appropriate.

04:11:18.021 --> 04:11:19.298
MATT: Right.

04:11:19.298 --> 04:11:22.995
TRAVIS: But who wants it? Who needs it?

04:11:22.995 --> 04:11:26.500
SAM: I mean, who's going to die?

04:11:26.500 --> 04:11:27.945
TALIESIN: This one, definitely.

04:11:27.945 --> 04:11:32.084
LAURA: Okay, here's the thing. The people that
have the trammels should probably have a Death

04:11:32.084 --> 04:11:33.342
Ward, too.

04:11:33.342 --> 04:11:37.428
TRAVIS: I've got my one hit point regenerate,
regenerate, regenerate.

04:11:37.428 --> 04:11:40.489
LAURA: Okay, you're good.

04:11:40.489 --> 04:11:42.478
SAM: Pike can have one.

04:11:42.478 --> 04:11:43.828
ASHLEY: I have my armor.

04:11:43.828 --> 04:11:48.531
LAURA: Okay, so that bumps you back up once you've
gone down once. So really, he needs-- and you,

04:11:48.531 --> 04:11:50.350
well, no. You won't come back right away.

04:11:50.350 --> 04:11:52.490
LIAM: If I have the Death Ward, I will pop back
up.

04:11:52.490 --> 04:11:56.767
MATT: There is only one person that can complete
the Incantation of Sealing.

04:11:56.767 --> 04:11:59.875
SAM: That's me.

04:11:59.875 --> 04:12:02.003
TRAVIS: Sealing of what? Oh, the trammels?

04:12:02.003 --> 04:12:03.433
MATT: Once the trammels are in--

04:12:03.433 --> 04:12:05.016
TRAVIS: You've got to put it on Scanlan.

04:12:05.016 --> 04:12:06.699
TALIESIN: He has to do it. Without Scanlan,
everything goes to shit.

04:12:06.699 --> 04:12:08.153
LIAM: What about Scanlan Two? Can Scanlan Two do
it?

04:12:08.153 --> 04:12:12.076
SAM: Technically. He's not going to last that
long, guys.

04:12:12.076 --> 04:12:14.211
ASHLEY: I cast Death Ward on Scanlan.

04:12:14.211 --> 04:12:18.694
SAM: Pike, I accept your blessing.

04:12:18.694 --> 04:12:24.312
ASHLEY: Scanlan, if we get through this, you know
what that means, don't you?

04:12:24.312 --> 04:12:25.692
SAM: No, what does it mean?

04:12:25.692 --> 04:12:28.334
TALIESIN: It means that your clone's going to get
very lucky. You, on the other hand, no.

04:12:28.334 --> 04:12:31.759
ASHLEY: You'll just have to live. You wait and
find out.

04:12:31.759 --> 04:12:33.996
SAM: Well, what does it mean? What could it
mean?!

04:12:33.996 --> 04:12:36.480
ASHLEY: Just live! You'll see!

04:12:36.480 --> 04:12:38.952
SAM: Just then, the real Scanlan comes back from
peeing. He's like, what'd I miss, guys?

04:12:38.952 --> 04:12:51.168
(laughter)

04:12:51.168 --> 04:12:58.523
MATT: Ascending the stairs, you climb and climb,
the spiral continuing upward. Both of the stairs

04:12:58.523 --> 04:13:01.542
spiral upward, so which direction did you take?
The right, or the left?

04:13:01.542 --> 04:13:05.982
LAURA: The right. No, wait! Which hand does Vecna
chop off?

04:13:05.982 --> 04:13:07.214
MATT: The left.

04:13:07.214 --> 04:13:09.672
TRAVIS: What does your speech do, Keyleth, again?

04:13:09.672 --> 04:13:15.904
MARISHA: It gives you an additional 19 hit points.
Temporary hit points. So add plus 19 on top. When

04:13:15.904 --> 04:13:19.016
you lose them, they're gone. Huh?

04:13:19.016 --> 04:13:22.014
SAM: We're trying to decide whether we went left
or right up the stairs.

04:13:22.014 --> 04:13:23.307
TALIESIN: We went right.

04:13:23.307 --> 04:13:31.489
MATT: Okay. You spiral upward and upward and
upward, climbing an extremely long period of time.

04:13:31.489 --> 04:13:39.343
Your legs begin to ache a little bit. Then
another floor opens up. It appears the tower is

04:13:39.343 --> 04:13:45.494
now divided into two chambers. From the bottom
floor up, it's now two sides to a tower and you're

04:13:45.494 --> 04:13:53.538
on the right side. The hallway curves around the
outer edge of the tower. On the opposite side, you

04:13:53.538 --> 04:14:01.315
can see the staircase continues upward. The
interior of this chamber appears to be an

04:14:01.315 --> 04:14:08.462
incredible arcane laboratory, occupying the center
space of the tower inside. You see six overlapping

04:14:08.462 --> 04:14:11.998
circles of dulled runes and glyphs that encompass
the entire 30-foot walkway between here and the

04:14:11.998 --> 04:14:20.495
stairs. Shelves and tables of countless glass
tubes and metallic vices lay out across tables,

04:14:20.495 --> 04:14:29.620
organized in a near-OCD pattern. Tomes and books
line the inner chamber walls. What do you guys do?

04:14:29.620 --> 04:14:34.358
LIAM: I use Divine Sense and feel for undead. 60
feet.

04:14:34.358 --> 04:14:38.002
MATT: You sense around. No undead in the 60-foot
radius.

04:14:38.002 --> 04:14:41.115
LAURA: Does this feel like it might be Delilah's
room? Her chamber?

04:14:41.115 --> 04:14:42.688
MATT: You don't know.

04:14:42.688 --> 04:14:49.358
TALIESIN: From where I am, can I recognize any of
the book titles? Any of it?

04:14:49.358 --> 04:14:53.181
MATT: From where you are now? You can't even see.
It's too far away.

04:14:53.181 --> 04:14:57.956
LAURA: Is there any traps in this room?

04:14:57.956 --> 04:14:59.392
MATT: You can check for traps.

04:14:59.392 --> 04:15:00.378
LIAM: Fan out.

04:15:00.378 --> 04:15:01.450
JOE: Can you sense Vecna?

04:15:01.450 --> 04:15:02.533
TALIESIN: Yes. If Vecna moves, we will know.

04:15:02.533 --> 04:15:03.621
LAURA: What is that? Investigation?

04:15:03.621 --> 04:15:04.567
MATT: Investigation.

04:15:04.567 --> 04:15:05.436
LIAM: 24 for me.

04:15:05.436 --> 04:15:06.297
LAURA: 14 for me.

04:15:06.297 --> 04:15:12.318
MATT: Okay. I mean, there's symbols across the
ground here, but they seem pretty inert. Three of

04:15:12.318 --> 04:15:17.905
the circles in the center of the chamber appear to
be ready to trigger. By proximity. A five-foot

04:15:17.905 --> 04:15:19.099
proximity.

04:15:19.099 --> 04:15:21.087
LIAM: Where's the exit to this room?

04:15:21.087 --> 04:15:28.168
MATT: It's across the way, around the outside of
the tower wall, so you can follow along.

04:15:28.168 --> 04:15:29.732
LIAM: We can go around the edge.

04:15:29.732 --> 04:15:32.789
MATT: Most of you can. It's a very tight walk to
get through. You have a few large individuals.

04:15:32.789 --> 04:15:37.388
LIAM: What's making that so tight? Is there one
trap that's making it so tight, or all of them?

04:15:37.388 --> 04:15:43.256
MATT: There are three large circles that overlap
with each other that are triggerable, and then

04:15:43.256 --> 04:15:48.194
there are three inert ones that overlap. It's like
a series of Venn diagrams.

04:15:48.194 --> 04:15:49.651
LIAM: Did they seem arcane in nature?

04:15:49.651 --> 04:15:50.817
MATT: Yes, they do.

04:15:50.817 --> 04:15:52.606
LIAM: Do I have a shot in hell? Of disarming
them?

04:15:52.606 --> 04:15:57.660
TRAVIS: I take out the Immovable Rod and have it
in my hand.

04:15:57.660 --> 04:15:59.189
MATT: Okay. Make an intelligence check.

04:15:59.189 --> 04:16:04.792
LIAM: Natural 20.

04:16:04.792 --> 04:16:10.103
MATT: These traps are far beyond your
understanding to disable.

04:16:10.103 --> 04:16:12.102
LIAM: Okay, okay.

04:16:12.102 --> 04:16:14.726
MATT: You glance at these and go, "Oh, this is
bad."

04:16:14.726 --> 04:16:16.047
TRAVIS: We would need Dispels.

04:16:16.047 --> 04:16:25.938
LAURA: What if we go-- no, the people that are
small go around. I'll bamf Trinket out on one

04:16:25.938 --> 04:16:31.440
side, put Grog in, go back, put Arkhan in, go
back? We work our way around the runes.

04:16:31.440 --> 04:16:33.479
SAM: What about the zombies?

04:16:33.479 --> 04:16:35.756
LAURA: The zombies are little. They can work their
way around.

04:16:35.756 --> 04:16:37.459
SAM: No no, his slave zombies.

04:16:37.459 --> 04:16:38.451
TALIESIN: They're little.

04:16:38.451 --> 04:16:39.549
TRAVIS: His dead brother, and--

04:16:39.549 --> 04:16:48.931
JOE: Aw man, I wasn't thinking about it until you
brought it up again! Like, I was actually in an

04:16:48.931 --> 04:16:51.349
okay place!

04:16:51.349 --> 04:16:53.341
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, I thought, you know-- Got to
pay respect.

04:16:53.341 --> 04:16:54.647
LAURA: Are you guys okay with this plan?

04:16:54.647 --> 04:16:59.555
LIAM: (Marlon Brando voice) I could've been
somebody, Arkhan. Instead of a zombie. Because I am.

04:16:59.555 --> 04:17:01.769
JOE: (Marlon Brando voice) Vander, pick up the
mic, boy, and hit me in the head with it.

04:17:01.769 --> 04:17:08.984
MATT: I need everybody except for Arkhan and Grog
to go ahead and make a general dexterity check.

04:17:08.984 --> 04:17:15.804
LAURA: Oh, fuck. I thought we would be able to
avoid it. Natural 20!

04:17:15.804 --> 04:17:17.671
TALIESIN: 24.

04:17:17.671 --> 04:17:18.544
MATT: Okay.

04:17:18.544 --> 04:17:26.936
SAM: Scanlan Two is okay. He made a 17. Scanlan
One had a one.

04:17:26.936 --> 04:17:29.435
MATT: Okay. So. What'd you get?

04:17:29.435 --> 04:17:31.241
MARISHA: Oh, I had to roll?

04:17:31.241 --> 04:17:32.841
MATT: Everybody except for Arkhan and--

04:17:32.841 --> 04:17:36.790
MARISHA: Oh, everyone &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; for them! Dex save.

04:17:36.790 --> 04:17:40.449
LIAM: Oh, who's near me? Could I retcon and say
that I'm--

04:17:40.449 --> 04:17:42.072
MATT: Dexterity check. You add your dexterity
modifier.

04:17:42.072 --> 04:17:43.524
LIAM: What did you get? You got a natural one?

04:17:43.524 --> 04:17:44.656
MATT: Scanlan did, yeah.

04:17:44.656 --> 04:17:50.373
LIAM: If I'm next to him, because I give plus two
to saves, does that futz with it?

04:17:50.373 --> 04:17:54.952
MATT: It's not an ability check, it's a saving
throw. One is an auto-fail for a saving throw.

04:17:54.952 --> 04:17:56.689
JOE: They weren't within ten feet of me, were
they?

04:17:56.689 --> 04:18:01.275
MATT: No, next would have been partially across.
Because you couldn't get across, you're too wide.

04:18:01.275 --> 04:18:02.697
JOE: Fair enough.

04:18:02.697 --> 04:18:03.676
MARISHA: 13.

04:18:03.676 --> 04:18:12.105
MATT: Okay, that's fine. And you got? A four?
Okay. So. As you guys are moving across, Scanlan

04:18:12.105 --> 04:18:17.965
and Pike, you both are clustered next to each
other. Unfortunately, Pike begins to wobble. You

04:18:17.965 --> 04:18:22.179
reach to grab her and pull her in, but the armored
weight is too strong and you both accidentally

04:18:22.179 --> 04:18:27.611
step out of place. At which point, the glyph to
your left suddenly flares. You watch as, in a

04:18:27.611 --> 04:18:37.182
flash of sudden arcane energy, a cage of
force-like power encompasses the both of you in a

04:18:37.182 --> 04:18:45.418
cube. You see these bars of crackling energy
(lighting crackle) around. You're both currently

04:18:45.418 --> 04:18:48.244
stuck within this arcane entrapment. The gnomes.

04:18:48.244 --> 04:18:49.903
LAURA: Can Scanlan Two dispel that shit?

04:18:49.903 --> 04:18:52.383
SAM: I don't know Dispel Magic.

04:18:52.383 --> 04:18:53.687
MARISHA: Can you Dimension Door?

04:18:53.687 --> 04:19:00.308
SAM: Good question. If only the person in here
with me was also of gnome size. Oh wait! She is.

04:19:00.308 --> 04:19:01.901
We'll Dimension Door out.

04:19:01.901 --> 04:19:06.246
LIAM: Do we want to try to get everyone else
across before you do that? Maybe it's a

04:19:06.246 --> 04:19:07.447
one-time-only?

04:19:07.447 --> 04:19:09.117
LAURA: Everybody else went already.

04:19:09.117 --> 04:19:12.554
MATT: Well, they're currently blocking the path,
now, with this cage.

04:19:12.554 --> 04:19:14.289
LIAM: Oh, okay. Well, I meant the necklace, but.

04:19:14.289 --> 04:19:18.794
SAM: I don't know how this spell works. I hope it
works. We might get hit on the way out.

04:19:18.794 --> 04:19:28.771
MATT: Okay. As you clasp Pike and complete the
incantation, I need you to make a charisma saving throw.

04:19:28.771 --> 04:19:32.754
TRAVIS: Come on, buddy! Come on! Come on!

04:19:32.754 --> 04:19:38.050
SAM: A charisma save? Is this magic?

04:19:38.050 --> 04:19:40.856
MATT: It is.

04:19:40.856 --> 04:19:42.040
SAM: Okay. 20.

04:19:42.040 --> 04:19:45.869
MATT: 20? 20 will do it.

04:19:45.869 --> 04:19:49.815
SAM: I've never had to make a charisma saving
throw before.

04:19:49.815 --> 04:19:51.365
TALIESIN: You got very high.

04:19:51.365 --> 04:20:00.418
MATT: So. As you grab her and you both begin to
transport outside of the cage, you feel the force

04:20:00.418 --> 04:20:04.761
of it push back, but the nature of your innate
magical ability manages to puncture through that

04:20:04.761 --> 04:20:09.962
threshold and then both of you reappear at the
opposite side, no worse for wear. The cage is

04:20:09.962 --> 04:20:13.054
still present, though, and it's now blocking the
path across.

04:20:13.054 --> 04:20:17.470
The rest of you get across fine. It's the gnomes that
got stuck, and now the two of you are

04:20:17.538 --> 04:20:21.333
on the opposite end. You have 30 feet between you
and the opposite side, and that walkway

04:20:21.333 --> 04:20:22.901
is entirely closed off.

04:20:22.901 --> 04:20:24.498
JOE: We can do this.

04:20:24.498 --> 04:20:28.210
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm not worried one bit.

04:20:28.284 --> 04:20:30.228
SAM: Wait, did you switch your boots?

04:20:30.228 --> 04:20:32.225
TRAVIS: I did!

04:20:32.225 --> 04:20:33.826
LAURA: You can Spider Climb to the ceiling!

04:20:33.826 --> 04:20:40.927
TRAVIS: Do you want to Cirque du Soleil this
thing? We'll hold arms and I'll walk on the

04:20:40.927 --> 04:20:41.978
ceiling?

04:20:41.978 --> 04:20:48.291
SAM: Two shirtless, hunky dudes holding each
other?! In crazy poses?

04:20:48.291 --> 04:20:52.009
LIAM: Definitely take your armor off for this,
though. Definitely.

04:20:52.009 --> 04:20:54.800
MARISHA: Not for any particular reason.

04:20:54.800 --> 04:21:00.529
TALIESIN: We still have the pot. You could get
some oil and really make this work.

04:21:00.529 --> 04:21:07.495
JOE: My answer to your question was-- Cut to.

04:21:07.495 --> 04:21:15.061
TRAVIS: Yeah, I will walk up on the wall so that
I'm sticking out.

04:21:15.061 --> 04:21:24.546
TALIESIN: That's a lot of powerful--

04:21:24.546 --> 04:21:26.797
JOE: Oh, I have four fingers.

04:21:26.797 --> 04:21:34.843
MATT: Okay. The force cage encompasses too much of
the wall space to go sideways, so you'll have to

04:21:34.843 --> 04:21:37.021
go across the ceiling.

04:21:37.021 --> 04:21:43.129
TRAVIS: Because I was inverted, &lt;i&gt;bullshit&lt;/i&gt;. Top
Gun? Thank you.

04:21:43.129 --> 04:21:50.072
MATT: As you climb the top and you pull, Arkhan,
you tuck your feet up underneath.

04:21:50.072 --> 04:21:56.950
TRAVIS: Treat me like your fucking dragons--
French girl, whatever.

04:21:56.950 --> 04:21:59.701
LIAM: Paint me like one of your chromatic girls.

04:21:59.701 --> 04:22:08.907
JOE: You like volleyball, bro? Just thinking, if
we make it out of here, we should play some beach

04:22:08.907 --> 04:22:10.208
volleyball some time.

04:22:10.208 --> 04:22:14.147
TRAVIS: Hand wraps, get some aviators? It'd be
totally cool.

04:22:14.147 --> 04:22:22.086
MATT: Could you both please make athletics checks
for me?

04:22:22.086 --> 04:22:24.357
TRAVIS: I'm still raging.

04:22:24.357 --> 04:22:30.282
MATT: Yeah, you've been raging this whole time.
You're the most intense spotter right now.

04:22:30.282 --> 04:22:31.470
JOE: This is an athletics check?

04:22:31.470 --> 04:22:35.010
MATT: Yes.

04:22:35.010 --> 04:22:36.310
JOE: 22.

04:22:36.310 --> 04:22:37.685
TRAVIS: 25.

04:22:37.685 --> 04:22:46.139
MATT: Step by step, you carry the heavy, armored,
red-scaled dragonborn across the threshold of the

04:22:46.139 --> 04:22:52.694
chamber. You release him and both safely come to
the opposite side of the laboratory.

04:22:52.694 --> 04:22:57.543
LAURA: Good job, guys.

04:22:57.543 --> 04:22:59.673
LIAM: Is it hot in here?

04:22:59.673 --> 04:23:02.566
TRAVIS: Not a problem. What happened to you guys?

04:23:02.566 --> 04:23:06.041
JOE: Did you guys see that?

04:23:06.041 --> 04:23:10.216
SAM: Yes. We did.

04:23:10.216 --> 04:23:12.764
MATT: You continue up the stairs?

04:23:12.764 --> 04:23:14.145
ALL: Yes.

04:23:14.145 --> 04:23:18.318
LIAM: Point of order. I know roughly how far Vecna
is, right? So I should be able to tell, as we're

04:23:18.318 --> 04:23:25.763
getting closer, roughly how much distance? Halfway
up the tower, three quarters, et cetera?

04:23:25.763 --> 04:23:30.538
MATT: You guys are, based on far you've climbed,
you're about halfway up the tower.

04:23:30.538 --> 04:23:37.087
TALIESIN: I would like to do one thing before we
leave the room. I would like to take something,

04:23:37.087 --> 04:23:39.199
set it on fire, and toss it on those books over
there.

04:23:39.199 --> 04:23:40.992
LIAM: Oh, that's dark.

04:23:40.992 --> 04:23:42.468
LAURA: Nice.

04:23:42.468 --> 04:23:48.347
MARISHA: We're holding on our Freedom of Movement,
right? We decided that? Until we get higher?

04:23:48.347 --> 04:23:50.940
LIAM: How long did it take us to get to this
point?

04:23:50.940 --> 04:24:00.466
MATT: I'd say a little over ten minutes or so of
continuous climbing.

04:24:00.466 --> 04:24:06.057
LIAM: Who knows what is above us. It could be
slower for the upper half.

04:24:06.057 --> 04:24:09.086
SAM: Fire stays where it is, typically. It doesn't
move up.

04:24:09.086 --> 04:24:11.195
LAURA: We're fine. I like it.

04:24:11.195 --> 04:24:16.310
TALIESIN: There's nothing else to catch fire in
here. It'll be nice.

04:24:16.310 --> 04:24:18.462
TRAVIS: Is there anything else to catch fire that
would travel upward toward us as we're climbing a

04:24:18.462 --> 04:24:20.315
towering inferno?

04:24:20.315 --> 04:24:24.500
MATT: It's a stone chamber.

04:24:24.500 --> 04:24:25.916
SAM: Full of chemicals.

04:24:25.916 --> 04:24:32.262
TALIESIN: It'll be noxious, but brief. I take a
torch. I actually have one last Whitestone seal

04:24:32.262 --> 04:24:36.952
that's flash-powdered. Wrap it, light it, and toss
it on the counter.

04:24:36.952 --> 04:24:42.377
MATT: Okay. It clatters and the torch burns. The
powder (flaring).

04:24:42.377 --> 04:24:43.859
TALIESIN: That'll do. Walk away.

04:24:43.859 --> 04:24:49.996
MATT: You guys continue up the next set of spiral
stairs, climbing higher and higher up Entropis.

04:24:49.996 --> 04:24:55.049
You can see, every now and then, one of the
various vein-like cracks of energy that's holding

04:24:55.049 --> 04:25:01.879
the tower together. You can glance out and see,
very obscured, movement in the distance. It's too

04:25:01.879 --> 04:25:08.139
fractured; too much diffraction.

04:25:08.139 --> 04:25:19.716
Continuing upward, you come to a second, or
another, floor. About four minutes of climbing.

04:25:19.716 --> 04:25:27.190
This next half-chamber, you see dozens of sets of
chains and manacles affixed to the walls, where

04:25:27.190 --> 04:25:35.821
tortured corpses are currently dangling from them,
left in pieces. The scent is terrible. Decay is strong.

04:25:35.821 --> 04:25:40.844
LIAM: I cast Divine Sense. Undead.

04:25:40.844 --> 04:25:44.249
MATT: No undead.

04:25:44.249 --> 04:25:45.487
LIAM: Traps?

04:25:45.487 --> 04:25:48.990
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

04:25:48.990 --> 04:25:50.125
LIAM: 18.

04:25:50.125 --> 04:25:53.114
MATT: Okay. No traps in this chamber.

04:25:53.114 --> 04:25:55.538
TALIESIN: Do we recognize any of the corpses?

04:25:55.538 --> 04:25:57.640
MATT: Make a perception check.

04:25:57.640 --> 04:26:01.028
TALIESIN: I had to do it. Natural 20.

04:26:01.028 --> 04:26:03.121
MARISHA: Oh no!

04:26:03.121 --> 04:26:05.620
TALIESIN: I get to know. The rest of you don't get
to know.

04:26:05.620 --> 04:26:07.467
MATT: Most of the corpses around here have been
mutilated to the point where it's hard to even

04:26:07.467 --> 04:26:12.983
recognize. This was essentially a torture chamber.
This was a gathering information, this was a

04:26:12.983 --> 04:26:18.967
point-making chamber. The ones you do see around
here, nothing catches your eye. One does seem

04:26:18.967 --> 04:26:28.557
familiar. You look and see, and it's been a while,
but you remember the face of a Scalebearer Desona,

04:26:28.557 --> 04:26:38.118
who traveled across the Ozmit Sea with you aboard
a skyship. Glancing around, the bodies appear to

04:26:38.118 --> 04:26:45.007
have been cleaned of any useful items. This is
mainly a for-utility-and-fun chamber.

04:26:45.007 --> 04:26:49.792
TRAVIS: Any weapons or items besides the chains
and manacles on the floor?

04:26:49.792 --> 04:26:53.311
MATT: The room is clean.

04:26:53.311 --> 04:26:58.653
LIAM: How far above us is Vecna?

04:26:58.653 --> 04:27:00.473
MATT: About 120 feet.

04:27:00.473 --> 04:27:02.327
LAURA: We should cast it now. We should do all of
our casting.

04:27:02.391 --> 04:27:03.772
MARISHA: Okay.

04:27:03.772 --> 04:27:06.555
LAURA: Now I invoke the Blessing of the
Dawnfather.

04:27:06.555 --> 04:27:09.071
TRAVIS: Call it out.

04:27:09.071 --> 04:27:10.844
MARISHA: I'm waiting for Pike.

04:27:10.844 --> 04:27:12.701
ASHLEY: Let's do it.

04:27:12.701 --> 04:27:17.297
MATT: Okay. Doing a round of what spells to who?

04:27:17.297 --> 04:27:26.220
MARISHA: Freedom of Movement to Scanlan One,
myself, Vax.

04:27:26.220 --> 04:27:28.555
MATT: So only three Freedoms of Movement?

04:27:28.555 --> 04:27:31.496
SAM: That's all she has, right?

04:27:31.496 --> 04:27:33.112
MARISHA: That's all I've got. From Keyleth.

04:27:33.112 --> 04:27:34.457
MATT: From Keyleth, right. And then, Pike?

04:27:34.457 --> 04:27:39.025
ASHLEY: Freedom of Movement on Vex, Grog, and
Pike.

04:27:39.025 --> 04:27:41.351
LIAM: I'm putting the wings out now.

04:27:41.351 --> 04:27:46.431
MATT: The raven wings emerge. Pike? You said you
were doing Death Ward?

04:27:46.431 --> 04:27:49.467
LAURA: Oh yeah, she did it on Scanlan.

04:27:49.467 --> 04:27:51.084
ASHLEY: Death Ward at a 5th-level.

04:27:51.084 --> 04:27:53.673
MATT: Okay, so 5th slot's taken.

04:27:53.673 --> 04:27:57.273
SAM: Scanlan will invoke the Blessing of the
Knowing Mistress.

04:27:57.273 --> 04:28:07.507
MATT: You watch as the forehead space, where once
you had seen the briefly visible third eye of

04:28:07.507 --> 04:28:15.858
Ioun, now emblazoned like a lantern light, this
bright purple eye. In that moment, you watch as

04:28:15.858 --> 04:28:17.881
Scanlan's pupils turn to silver.

04:28:17.881 --> 04:28:20.759
LAURA: Whoa! Are you still you?

04:28:20.759 --> 04:28:26.944
SAM: I can't see anything! Everything's silver! Oh
god, I'm blind! I'm just kidding. I can see fine.

04:28:26.944 --> 04:28:29.867
TALIESIN: I charge Diplomacy up.

04:28:29.867 --> 04:28:31.512
ASHLEY: And I will invoke the Blessing of the
Everlight.

04:28:31.512 --> 04:28:35.803
MATT: And with that, you watch as this bright
light emerges from the back of Pike's shoulders as

04:28:35.803 --> 04:28:44.791
a familiar, but much more vibrant and strong set
of divine golden wings, not made of energy, but

04:28:44.791 --> 04:28:55.885
visibly beautiful gold feathered wings expand from
her back. Your feet lift off the ground and

04:28:55.885 --> 04:29:00.315
(whooshing). As the voice of Sarenrae whispers
into her ear, "I'm with you."

04:29:00.315 --> 04:29:04.552
ASHLEY: (squealing) Okay! Thank you!

04:29:04.552 --> 04:29:06.521
LAURA: I bamf Trinket out.

04:29:06.521 --> 04:29:08.615
MATT: (bear noises)

04:29:08.615 --> 04:29:10.458
LAURA: If you want to Polymorph him?

04:29:10.458 --> 04:29:16.507
SAM: Now's the time? Polymorph only lasts-- is it
an hour or ten minutes? I've got to learn this.

04:29:16.507 --> 04:29:23.506
MATT: Polymorph, I think, is an hour with
concentration. Could be wrong, but I think it is.

04:29:23.506 --> 04:29:27.206
Do note, you still have another series of
staircases that are pretty tight.

04:29:27.206 --> 04:29:29.104
LAURA: Okay, we should go up. We should keep
going.

04:29:29.104 --> 04:29:32.900
LIAM: Also, I'm going to say this now, in advance.
It might not be possible, but if we get to a door,

04:29:32.900 --> 04:29:39.079
I'm thinking ahead of time, if we think we're
about to step out, I want to cast Bless on the

04:29:39.079 --> 04:29:44.798
three half-elves right before going out. That
might not be possible, but it's in my head to do it.

04:29:44.798 --> 04:29:46.423
MATT: Okay, good to keep in mind.

04:29:46.423 --> 04:29:47.800
JOE: We should send Delilah in first.

04:29:47.800 --> 04:29:48.999
SAM: Yeah, sure.

04:29:48.999 --> 04:29:50.312
MARISHA: That's actually a good idea.

04:29:50.312 --> 04:29:58.450
SAM: Scanlan Two is going to dump a 3rd-level
spell into the Tome of Isolation to reveal the

04:29:58.450 --> 04:30:02.486
hidden text. Is it only revealed to Scanlan Two,
or is it revealed to everyone?

04:30:02.486 --> 04:30:14.387
MATT: Let me see the item again. Well, the text
remains for an hour, yep.

04:30:14.387 --> 04:30:24.553
LIAM: You're blessed. If it happens, hashtag
blessed, a d4 rolled for every attack or saving throw.

04:30:24.553 --> 04:30:36.344
MATT: Once the text is revealed, technically,
anybody with any sort of penchant for arcane

04:30:36.344 --> 04:30:39.002
knowledge could attempt it, but you have the best
chance.

04:30:39.002 --> 04:30:42.454
LAURA: So you don't need to do that.

04:30:42.454 --> 04:30:45.326
SAM: No, I do need to, to reveal the text. It's
hidden otherwise.

04:30:45.326 --> 04:30:51.079
MATT: Correct, but the text is revealed for an
hour. If, in theory, you were to fall, and the

04:30:51.079 --> 04:30:54.780
book could be found--

04:30:54.780 --> 04:30:58.873
TRAVIS: I got it. I'll pick it up and start
reading.

04:30:58.873 --> 04:31:01.713
MATT: Yep. It's more difficult, but it's
possible.

04:31:01.713 --> 04:31:04.328
SAM: I have a book I need to read.

04:31:04.328 --> 04:31:09.843
MARISHA: It's possible, but (uncertain noise)? Is
what his face was?

04:31:09.843 --> 04:31:14.733
MATT: Because he was the chosen of Ioun, he can
read without issue, but the text itself is still

04:31:14.733 --> 04:31:16.529
very arcane in nature.

04:31:16.529 --> 04:31:22.084
LAURA: He's the only one that can finish the
sealing.

04:31:22.084 --> 04:31:37.735
MARISHA: Right. Then Keyleth turns to Vax:
Whatever happens, lest it be trite, stay with us.

04:31:37.735 --> 04:31:44.238
Casts Guidance for the next minute, which gives
you 1d4 on ability checks.

04:31:44.238 --> 04:31:46.044
LAURA: Right before we go out, you mean?

04:31:46.044 --> 04:31:48.930
MARISHA: Yeah, before we move. Just for the start
of it.

04:31:48.930 --> 04:31:55.038
MATT: You guys begin to climb up the next
staircase? All right. You're beginning to spiral

04:31:55.038 --> 04:32:02.676
up the next length of it. You get about 80 or so
feet up before-- are you leading this charge

04:32:02.676 --> 04:32:04.321
visibly?

04:32:04.321 --> 04:32:08.429
TRAVIS: Actually, Delilah is.

04:32:08.429 --> 04:32:11.701
MATT: You're sending Delilah ahead of you?

04:32:11.701 --> 04:32:13.973
LAURA: When we get up to the top.

04:32:13.973 --> 04:32:24.772
MATT: As you're coursing around the edge, the
stairs stop into another chamber. The chamber

04:32:24.772 --> 04:32:25.938
levels off.

04:32:25.938 --> 04:32:29.256
LIAM: Up so that we're seeing the edge of steps at
the top? All right, I'm stealthing.

04:32:29.256 --> 04:32:31.149
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

04:32:31.149 --> 04:32:33.090
JOE: Very quickly, Grog, give me another longsword
for zombie Vander.

04:32:33.090 --> 04:32:34.437
TRAVIS: Last one I have. You got it.

04:32:34.437 --> 04:32:36.288
LIAM: Are we Pass Without a Trace right now? 44.

04:32:36.288 --> 04:32:43.515
MATT: 44? So you stealth up around the edge and
you see now, where once it was divided into two

04:32:43.515 --> 04:32:49.828
chambers, it now seems the chambers converged once
more into a single room. It's not very big, and

04:32:49.828 --> 04:32:56.284
the tower's been slowly tapering the higher up you
go. The room is fairly empty. You see a few vases

04:32:56.284 --> 04:33:03.928
in the corners and some basic ancient decor.
Standing, not noticing you're there, you see three

04:33:03.928 --> 04:33:12.739
figures in full dark armor. Similar to who you
fought in the ziggurat, or the one who was

04:33:12.739 --> 04:33:14.414
guarding the tunnel that led up into Thar
Amphala.

04:33:14.414 --> 04:33:16.515
LIAM: They don't look like the big kahuna, they
look like the underlings?

04:33:16.515 --> 04:33:21.157
MATT: The underlings. You see them in the same
dark, horned armor. There's one that's humanoid

04:33:21.157 --> 04:33:24.630
sized and one that looks to be halfling size. Or
two of them, halfling size.

04:33:24.630 --> 04:33:30.110
LIAM: From my hidden position, I want to see if I
see any traps in the room.

04:33:30.110 --> 04:33:34.542
MATT: Make an investigation check for the
immediate entry.

04:33:34.542 --> 04:33:38.800
LIAM: I'm not entering. I want to do it from my
peeky spot.

04:33:38.800 --> 04:33:45.065
MATT: For the immediate entry for what you can
see. You can't investigate from across the room.

04:33:45.065 --> 04:33:47.173
TRAVIS: They're facing away from us?

04:33:47.173 --> 04:33:48.702
MATT: They're not facing away, but they don't seem
to acknowledge his presence yet. They don't see him.

04:33:48.702 --> 04:33:52.993
LIAM: Yeah. 23 for investigation.

04:33:52.993 --> 04:33:57.055
MATT: You don't see any traps in the immediate
vicinity of the room.

04:33:57.055 --> 04:34:03.723
LIAM: So what I'm going to do is slowly back down
to the party, relate what I just saw. Three of

04:34:03.723 --> 04:34:05.388
them. What do we do?

04:34:05.388 --> 04:34:07.054
SAM: Standard undead?

04:34:07.054 --> 04:34:09.703
LAURA: No, they're death knights.

04:34:09.703 --> 04:34:12.958
MATT: They're not death knights.

04:34:12.958 --> 04:34:19.055
LIAM: They're dudes in armor. They're lackeys.

04:34:19.055 --> 04:34:21.948
TALIESIN: Are they humans or undead?

04:34:21.948 --> 04:34:24.718
MATT: Can't tell. Fully armored.

04:34:24.718 --> 04:34:26.271
JOE: How far up the stairs?

04:34:26.271 --> 04:34:30.395
MATT: From where you guys are right now, they're
about 30 feet around the way and then ten feet

04:34:30.395 --> 04:34:31.574
into the chamber.

04:34:31.574 --> 04:34:34.672
JOE: I'll Divine Sense, which is up to 60 feet.
Are they fiends, celestial, or undead?

04:34:34.672 --> 04:34:36.366
MATT: Nope.

04:34:36.366 --> 04:34:37.699
JOE: It looks like they're human.

04:34:37.699 --> 04:34:45.832
LIAM: Is it difficult to use that silenced weapon
of yours?

04:34:45.832 --> 04:34:56.084
TALIESIN: Once I use it, I've got ten minutes of
silence. I was curious that if I get close enough

04:34:56.084 --> 04:35:04.109
to Vecna, he can't talk. I was hoping to save
that, because that might be a thing where we can

04:35:04.109 --> 04:35:06.140
keep him from casting vocal spells.

04:35:06.140 --> 04:35:09.141
MARISHA: Can we stealth around them and not fight
them at all?

04:35:09.141 --> 04:35:14.098
LIAM: It's a small room. You and I can probably
handle two, but that leaves a third.

04:35:14.098 --> 04:35:21.754
MATT: You see one staircase, one final staircase,
that winds around the corner. Actually, you

04:35:21.754 --> 04:35:23.322
haven't seen it yet.

04:35:23.322 --> 04:35:29.582
TRAVIS: There's no chance you could remove the
stone from the middle of the floor and have them fall?

04:35:29.582 --> 04:35:32.250
MARISHA: That's what I was looking for. Can
Keyleth take a peek and see what's up?

04:35:32.250 --> 04:35:37.657
MATT: Make a stealth check.

04:35:37.657 --> 04:35:38.656
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:35:38.656 --> 04:35:39.606
TALIESIN: Plus ten.

04:35:39.606 --> 04:35:40.720
MARISHA: Do you still have that?

04:35:40.720 --> 04:35:41.557
LIAM: Yeah.

04:35:41.557 --> 04:35:46.140
MARISHA: Dope. That's real good. 39.

04:35:46.140 --> 04:35:54.683
MATT: 39? As you curl around the edge and glance
inside, you recognize this chamber. When you

04:35:54.683 --> 04:36:01.374
scried in here previously, this was the chamber
that was being left by the death knight as he

04:36:01.374 --> 04:36:05.921
ascended to the top of the tower. This is the last
stop.

04:36:05.921 --> 04:36:09.356
MARISHA: (inarticulate yelling) Okay.

04:36:09.356 --> 04:36:11.284
LAURA: Can you open up the floor underneath them?

04:36:11.284 --> 04:36:14.285
MARISHA: Does it look like the floor opens?

04:36:14.285 --> 04:36:16.273
MATT: It doesn't look like it's a trap door or
anything.

04:36:16.273 --> 04:36:19.854
LAURA: It's stone. Could you open the floor and
let them fall?

04:36:19.854 --> 04:36:28.611
LIAM: Could Stubby and I each target one and you
yank one into the ground simultaneously? Can you

04:36:28.611 --> 04:36:30.394
do that right now?

04:36:30.394 --> 04:36:32.603
SAM: I could hold one.

04:36:32.603 --> 04:36:38.152
TALIESIN: Let's have you two take some out and
send the big guys in.

04:36:38.152 --> 04:36:41.238
MARISHA: It's worked stone.

04:36:41.238 --> 04:36:42.959
MATT: It's all worked stone. It's all very
carved.

04:36:42.959 --> 04:36:44.813
SAM: I could hold one. Paralyze one of them.

04:36:44.813 --> 04:36:52.949
TRAVIS: If we don't think the room or the setup
will fuck us up, the big boys can go in and

04:36:52.949 --> 04:36:57.091
probably handle it. Or we can follow your
attacks.

04:36:57.091 --> 04:37:02.630
LIAM: We don't want to create a stir. We might, so
it's better that we do two quietly and leave one

04:37:02.630 --> 04:37:06.465
left. Can you throw your fucking Manners ball at
the third?

04:37:06.465 --> 04:37:11.595
TALIESIN: It's better against weaker opponents.

04:37:11.595 --> 04:37:14.274
LAURA: It's a thin staircase. Three people won't
be able to attack at once.

04:37:14.274 --> 04:37:16.095
TALIESIN: I'll have ten minutes of silence.

04:37:16.095 --> 04:37:18.059
MATT: Two at most would be able to strike at
once.

04:37:18.059 --> 04:37:23.581
LAURA: So you and me go up, sneak attack, fall
back and let somebody run in and take it out. Yeah?

04:37:23.581 --> 04:37:25.643
LIAM: Yeah, so who's going in?

04:37:25.643 --> 04:37:29.217
MATT: You have the taller one in the center and
the two smaller ones flanking.

04:37:29.217 --> 04:37:31.139
LAURA: We'll take the smaller ones.

04:37:31.139 --> 04:37:33.167
TRAVIS: I would send in the dragonborn, because
they're all alive.

04:37:33.167 --> 04:37:34.607
JOE: Yeah.

04:37:34.607 --> 04:37:38.045
LAURA: Get ready to fight once we take the two
out.

04:37:38.045 --> 04:37:42.379
LIAM: Tell me again, the three that are in this
room?

04:37:42.379 --> 04:37:46.067
MATT: There's a human-sized one in the center and
two halfling-sized ones on either side.

04:37:46.067 --> 04:37:49.379
TRAVIS: Jocks Machina does not get hazed.

04:37:49.379 --> 04:37:55.048
JOE: Stop bullying Jocks Machina!

04:37:55.048 --> 04:38:01.046
LIAM: Arkhan, we're going to handle the small.
Right after, you'll handle the tall.

04:38:01.046 --> 04:38:03.652
JOE: Sounds good to me.

04:38:03.652 --> 04:38:07.170
LAURA: We sneak up. Is it auto-crit if it's a
sneak attack?

04:38:07.170 --> 04:38:08.549
MATT: If they're surprised.

04:38:08.549 --> 04:38:11.497
LAURA: Okay, are they surprised?

04:38:11.497 --> 04:38:14.256
LIAM: I stealthed. You have to stealth, right?

04:38:14.256 --> 04:38:16.760
MATT: You have to stealth.

04:38:16.760 --> 04:38:18.826
LAURA: Okay, 29.

04:38:18.826 --> 04:38:24.599
LIAM: I will go a split second before my sister.

04:38:24.726 --> 04:38:28.997
MATT: Both of you guys curl up to the edge and you
see the three of them. What are you doing?

04:38:28.997 --> 04:38:31.664
LAURA: We're attacking the two smallest.

04:38:31.664 --> 04:38:32.995
LIAM: Throwing on the right, throwing on the
left.

04:38:32.995 --> 04:38:35.112
MATT: You're attacking the one on the right, and
you're the one on the left. Go ahead and roll your

04:38:35.112 --> 04:38:36.723
attacks.

04:38:36.723 --> 04:38:38.197
LAURA: Is it auto-crit?

04:38:38.197 --> 04:38:46.345
MATT: If it hits, it's an auto-crit, but you have
advantage on the attack because they don't know

04:38:46.345 --> 04:38:47.443
you're there.

04:38:47.443 --> 04:38:54.322
LAURA: Oh, that's good. 30 on the first hit.

04:38:54.322 --> 04:38:55.469
MATT: That hits.

04:38:55.469 --> 04:39:00.719
LIAM: They all hit. That's good. Four.

04:39:00.719 --> 04:39:07.873
LAURA: Oh my god, I rolled four sixes! And a
five.

04:39:07.873 --> 04:39:10.691
LIAM: I'm doing okay, too.

04:39:10.691 --> 04:39:14.440
LAURA: 29 times two is what?

04:39:14.440 --> 04:39:18.197
SAM: Both of you guys got big damage.

04:39:18.197 --> 04:39:20.714
JOE: What is it? 29 times two?

04:39:20.714 --> 04:39:21.850
MATT: That's 58.

04:39:21.850 --> 04:39:24.051
LAURA: 58 plus eight, so 64. 66!

04:39:24.051 --> 04:39:26.665
LIAM: 80 for the first.

04:39:26.665 --> 04:39:28.827
LAURA: That's the first attack.

04:39:28.827 --> 04:39:31.325
MATT: All right, so a second attack for each of
you.

04:39:31.325 --> 04:39:34.682
LAURA: 19.

04:39:34.682 --> 04:39:36.212
MATT: That hits.

04:39:36.212 --> 04:39:39.056
LIAM: 12 for my second.

04:39:39.056 --> 04:39:40.650
MATT: Does not hit.

04:39:40.650 --> 04:39:44.119
LIAM: No, they all hit. All my attacks hit. 12
damage for the second.

04:39:44.119 --> 04:39:46.187
MATT: Okay, what's the damage on the second one?

04:39:46.187 --> 04:39:49.370
LAURA: 18 on the second.

04:39:49.370 --> 04:39:54.534
MATT: Both of the armored ones on the side take
the hit and crumple, fall back, helmet falling

04:39:54.595 --> 04:39:55.888
off. Unconscious.

04:39:55.888 --> 04:39:58.048
LAURA: I immediately move to the side so he can
run through.

04:39:58.048 --> 04:40:00.037
JOE: So the guy turns around? And I'm-- (whoosh)

04:40:00.037 --> 04:40:05.186
MATT: They're still in the center of the chamber.
They're about 15 feet from the top of the stairs.

04:40:05.186 --> 04:40:15.188
The two of you are going to rush in? Arkhan, you
rush in towards the one in the center, go for it.

04:40:15.188 --> 04:40:16.682
SAM: Unleash everything.

04:40:16.682 --> 04:40:25.305
JOE: I don't think I can reach. I don't think I'm
in range. Did you see that?

04:40:25.305 --> 04:40:28.461
MATT: So what'd you roll?

04:40:28.461 --> 04:40:34.900
SAM: Right as he runs, Scanlan says: Don't fuck
this up!

04:40:34.900 --> 04:40:41.738
MATT: As they both drop, you rush up to the one in
the metal armor, who doesn't react to your

04:40:41.738 --> 04:40:46.520
arrival, stands there staring at you as you rush
forward and swing. You hit the armor, but you hit

04:40:46.520 --> 04:40:49.217
the edge of the blade, cleaves off doing no
impact.

04:40:49.217 --> 04:40:55.944
LAURA: Does he move?

04:40:55.944 --> 04:41:00.026
JOE: That's attack one. Okay, that's a 21.

04:41:00.026 --> 04:41:01.362
MATT: 21 hits.

04:41:01.362 --> 04:41:07.866
TALIESIN: That looked bad from this angle. Yeah, I
see it now! Holy cow.

04:41:07.932 --> 04:41:11.310
JOE: He's not undead. He's not undead, is he?

04:41:11.310 --> 04:41:13.023
MATT: He's not undead, nope.

04:41:13.023 --> 04:41:26.062
JOE: Okay. Well, this is going to be weird, then.
Oh, that's not bad. That's 28.

04:41:26.062 --> 04:41:32.812
MATT: 28, all right. You hack and the axe slides
into the front of the breast plate and as you pull

04:41:32.812 --> 04:41:35.648
back, you see a gout of blood. He takes it not
reacting.

04:41:35.648 --> 04:41:36.898
JOE: Just stands there?

04:41:36.898 --> 04:41:39.911
TALIESIN: Maybe we shouldn't kill all of--

04:41:39.911 --> 04:41:42.488
JOE: I would like to bonus action.

04:41:42.488 --> 04:41:43.855
MATT: Okay.

04:41:43.855 --> 04:41:48.474
JOE: No, I wouldn't. I'm not--

04:41:48.474 --> 04:41:53.142
LAURA: Why isn't he moving? Does he have a helmet
on?

04:41:53.142 --> 04:41:55.229
MATT: Yeah. The one standing has a helmet and the
two that fell, their helmets tumbled off as they

04:41:55.229 --> 04:41:56.687
impacted and fell back.

04:41:56.687 --> 04:41:59.199
ASHLEY: What do they look like up there when their
helmets came off?

04:41:59.199 --> 04:42:00.942
LAURA: Oh no! Were they our friends?

04:42:00.942 --> 04:42:03.946
JOE: What friends?

04:42:03.946 --> 04:42:07.361
LAURA: Pull the helmet off. Arkhan, pull the
helmet off!

04:42:07.361 --> 04:42:09.522
JOE: I pull the helmet off.

04:42:09.522 --> 04:42:14.939
MATT: You pull the helmet off and you watch
immediately a bit of black, fuzzy facial hair from

04:42:14.939 --> 04:42:22.867
underneath. As you reveal, you see darkened skin
and long black hair with a bit of colored makeup

04:42:22.867 --> 04:42:30.131
under the eyes and a metal band across the
forehead, looking ahead, unmoving, unflinching,

04:42:30.131 --> 04:42:33.112
locked in place staring past you.

04:42:33.112 --> 04:42:36.720
LAURA: Is it Gilmore?

04:42:36.720 --> 04:42:40.430
MATT: You glance up, and it's Gilmore standing in
the middle of the room.

04:42:40.430 --> 04:42:42.670
LAURA: We killed the two--

04:42:42.670 --> 04:42:44.674
TRAVIS: No, we don't know anything yet.

04:42:44.674 --> 04:42:52.996
JOE: I command zombie Delilah and zombie Vander to
go to the heads and take the helmets off the two

04:42:52.996 --> 04:42:54.566
heads on the ground.

04:42:54.566 --> 04:43:00.529
MATT: The helmets are partially off, so it's easy
enough to slip the helms off. To the left, it was

04:43:00.529 --> 04:43:07.269
less of a halfling and more of a younger girl.
Jammed into the armor and a little taller than the

04:43:07.269 --> 04:43:13.422
other, you can see brown hair with a shock of
white in it currently laying back, unmoving and

04:43:13.505 --> 04:43:23.222
bleeding out. The other one looks to be
specifically gnomish, short brown hair and eyes

04:43:23.222 --> 04:43:25.280
wide on the ground.

04:43:25.280 --> 04:43:28.221
SAM: (high-pitched) Is that my girl? Is that my
baby girl?

04:43:28.221 --> 04:43:39.451
ASHLEY: I think it's an illusion. I'm hoping. I
don't know. I feel this can't be real.

04:43:39.451 --> 04:43:41.398
SAM: It's my baby girl--

04:43:41.398 --> 04:43:54.424
ASHLEY: I'm going in. Can I stand over one of the
bodies and do a perception check? A medicine check?

04:43:54.424 --> 04:43:55.981
MATT: Make a medicine check.

04:43:55.981 --> 04:44:03.483
TRAVIS: No, there's no way.

04:44:03.483 --> 04:44:05.960
ASHLEY: 23.

04:44:05.960 --> 04:44:13.541
MATT: 23? They're not illusions, and they are both
dead.

04:44:13.541 --> 04:44:16.521
JOE: I cut the head off of the one in the middle.

04:44:16.521 --> 04:44:19.024
LAURA: No, don't do it! Arkhan, don't!

04:44:19.024 --> 04:44:22.725
ASHLEY: No! I stand in front of him and say: no!
Please don't!

04:44:22.725 --> 04:44:25.977
MATT: They still have the bands. Each one of them
has this strange brass band across the head.

04:44:25.977 --> 04:44:31.646
ASHLEY: I take my mace, and I slowly try to take
one of the bands off.

04:44:31.646 --> 04:44:33.982
MATT: You take it off the head of one of the two
dead?

04:44:33.982 --> 04:44:36.021
ASHLEY: Yeah, but not touching it, scraping it
off.

04:44:36.021 --> 04:44:37.242
MATT: It slides off.

04:44:37.242 --> 04:44:41.156
ASHLEY: Does anything happen?

04:44:41.156 --> 04:44:43.784
LAURA: Can we cast Revivify on them?

04:44:43.784 --> 04:44:48.539
TRAVIS: Don't do that.

04:44:48.539 --> 04:44:49.616
SAM: Yeah, do that.

04:44:49.616 --> 04:44:51.022
LAURA: Who is it? Who are they for sure?

04:44:51.022 --> 04:44:52.762
MATT: It is Kaylie and Cassandra.

04:44:52.762 --> 04:44:54.485
LAURA: It's Kaylie and Cassandra?

04:44:54.485 --> 04:44:58.326
SAM: Revivify them. Take the bands off and
Revivify them.

04:44:58.326 --> 04:45:01.874
TALIESIN: What is the band, before we do
anything?

04:45:01.874 --> 04:45:04.794
SAM: Take it off of Gilmore. He's still alive.

04:45:04.794 --> 04:45:06.363
TALIESIN: This may kill him.

04:45:06.363 --> 04:45:08.392
MATT: No, she took it off one of the front.

04:45:08.392 --> 04:45:10.001
ASHLEY: Does Gilmore look like he's still alive?

04:45:10.001 --> 04:45:12.246
MATT: He's wounded, but he's still alive and
staring forward.

04:45:12.246 --> 04:45:13.511
ASHLEY: I'll do the same thing.

04:45:13.511 --> 04:45:20.445
MATT: You pull the band off, and the eyes flicker
for a second. (panting) "What happened? Where am

04:45:20.445 --> 04:45:22.230
"I? How--"

04:45:22.230 --> 04:45:24.046
JOE: I pull the axe back.

04:45:24.046 --> 04:45:29.017
MATT: "What happened?"

04:45:29.017 --> 04:45:32.638
MARISHA: He doesn't know.

04:45:32.638 --> 04:45:34.918
SAM: Save her. Right now.

04:45:34.918 --> 04:45:37.532
JOE: I put my hand up over his mouth.

04:45:37.532 --> 04:45:40.341
TALIESIN: Take them.

04:45:40.341 --> 04:45:42.150
ASHLEY: It's okay.

04:45:42.150 --> 04:45:43.873
MATT: He looks down.

04:45:43.873 --> 04:45:51.356
ASHLEY: I stand over Kaylie and I cast Revivify.

04:45:51.356 --> 04:46:05.864
MATT: You see the eyes lull back, the stillness of
the body as you finish touching the body a warm

04:46:05.864 --> 04:46:17.163
burst. (gasps) Breath comes back to her and she
starts coughing. Sits up and leans over, gasping.

04:46:17.163 --> 04:46:18.978
SAM: I go, grab her, and hold her.

04:46:18.978 --> 04:46:21.362
ASHLEY: I stand over Cassandra and I cast
Revivify.

04:46:21.362 --> 04:46:30.007
SAM: These are big spells, aren't they?

04:46:30.007 --> 04:46:37.087
MATT: As you reach out and touch her chest, the
brief moment of stillness leads as her eyes slowly

04:46:37.087 --> 04:46:43.511
blink back, and begins breathing again.

04:46:43.511 --> 04:46:45.957
TRAVIS: This is some Seven shit right here.

04:46:45.957 --> 04:46:49.244
LAURA: That is so fucked up!

04:46:49.244 --> 04:46:54.804
SAM: Shaun. Can you get them out of here?

04:46:54.804 --> 04:46:57.427
MATT: "Yes, I--"

04:46:57.427 --> 04:47:03.431
LAURA: How did you get here? Is it really you?

04:47:03.431 --> 04:47:05.298
LIAM: Do you remember anything, Shaun?

04:47:05.298 --> 04:47:07.844
MARISHA: Anything that can help us?

04:47:07.844 --> 04:47:15.836
MATT: "I was in my workshop, and there was a flash
of light. A doorway opened, and it pulled me

04:47:15.836 --> 04:47:17.393
"through and--"

04:47:17.393 --> 04:47:19.820
LAURA: Can I roll an insight check and see if it's
him?

04:47:19.820 --> 04:47:21.111
MATT: Roll an insight check.

04:47:21.111 --> 04:47:24.611
LIAM: I'm taking him by the cheeks. You're in a
very bad place. You're in a very bad place and

04:47:24.611 --> 04:47:30.652
time. You need to get out of here. You need to
take these women and go downstairs and hide.

04:47:30.652 --> 04:47:32.821
LAURA: 21.

04:47:32.821 --> 04:47:35.390
MATT: 21? It's Shaun Gilmore.

04:47:35.390 --> 04:47:41.013
LIAM: You are in no shape to do anything right
now. You need to take these two women and hide

04:47:41.013 --> 04:47:42.319
downstairs. Do you hear me?

04:47:42.319 --> 04:47:44.156
MATT: "Where are we? What's going on?"

04:47:44.156 --> 04:47:45.716
LIAM: There's no time to explain.

04:47:45.716 --> 04:47:49.532
MARISHA: We're in the tower of Entropis. We're on
the back of a titan. Try to get them as far away

04:47:49.532 --> 04:47:52.709
from here as possible. Vasselheim is an hour
away.

04:47:52.709 --> 04:47:55.243
LAURA: Or you can fight with us.

04:47:55.243 --> 04:48:01.114
LIAM: No. His head is not where it needs to be.

04:48:01.114 --> 04:48:08.165
MATT: "Wait. So if we're in-- We're near
Vasselheim? What's Entropis?"

04:48:08.165 --> 04:48:13.103
MARISHA: No, we're in Thar Amphala. It's been
teleported to the back of a titan, which is a

04:48:13.103 --> 04:48:18.049
giant mountain, which is what we're on. It's from
the Shadowfell. You just have to get away!

04:48:18.049 --> 04:48:21.749
LAURA: We're 15 feet below Vecna. He's right above
us.

04:48:21.749 --> 04:48:23.484
MATT: "Then what are you going to do?"

04:48:23.484 --> 04:48:24.683
LAURA: We're going to fight him.

04:48:24.683 --> 04:48:26.638
MARISHA: And you're going to go away.

04:48:26.638 --> 04:48:39.885
LIAM: In 30 minutes, we could all be dead. But if
we have any chance-- You three need to not be

04:48:39.885 --> 04:48:42.140
here. You need to go down now.

04:48:42.140 --> 04:48:49.037
MATT: "I can get the three of us away. I can
teleport us. It's the maximum of what I can do."

04:48:49.037 --> 04:48:54.664
MARISHA: J'mon Sa Ord is here, the Slayer's Take
has probably been vastly compromised. Just get out

04:48:54.664 --> 04:48:59.213
of here. Get to the woods. Scanlan's right.

04:48:59.213 --> 04:49:03.536
MATT: "I can probably take us back to Emon. Why
even stay here?"

04:49:03.536 --> 04:49:05.152
MARISHA: Then go! Go!

04:49:05.152 --> 04:49:10.271
MATT: "I'll do that. You're going to fight this
Vecna?"

04:49:10.271 --> 04:49:14.385
TALIESIN: I hate to even ask, but is there
anything you can do and still--?

04:49:14.385 --> 04:49:22.773
MATT: "If we make it quick."

04:49:22.773 --> 04:49:25.473
TRAVIS: I'd almost rather him stay and fight.

04:49:25.473 --> 04:49:30.144
SAM: No! He's got to get them away. They're at one
hit point each!

04:49:30.144 --> 04:49:42.042
MATT: "If you can make this quick, I can leave you
with some intense adrenaline, my friend."

04:49:42.042 --> 04:49:43.331
TRAVIS: Me?

04:49:43.331 --> 04:49:44.570
MATT: "Yes."

04:49:44.570 --> 04:49:48.626
TRAVIS: I'm a fan of adrenaline.

04:49:48.626 --> 04:49:52.967
MATT: He looks around to the blood on the floor
and the two barely living women at his side and

04:49:52.967 --> 04:50:01.627
says, "If the one you're going to fight is the one
that did this to me and them... Leave a scar in my

04:50:01.627 --> 04:50:06.667
"name, if you don't mind. When it's done, maybe
carve a unicorn."

04:50:06.667 --> 04:50:08.996
TRAVIS: With pleasure.

04:50:08.996 --> 04:50:18.070
MATT: You begin to hear heavy footsteps coming up
the stairs behind you, heavy footfalls, and a

04:50:18.070 --> 04:50:27.224
number of other footsteps heading up the tower
behind you. He goes and grabs the bodies close.

04:50:27.224 --> 04:50:32.850
Glancing around you, up the stairway you see
emerging the death knight who joined you in the

04:50:32.850 --> 04:50:34.170
fight against Vecna.

04:50:34.170 --> 04:50:37.752
SAM: I grab Kaylie by the face and I say to her:
Goodbye.

04:50:37.752 --> 04:50:43.829
MATT: The one that met you at the top of the tower
last time you fought Vecna emerges, looks across,

04:50:43.829 --> 04:50:46.047
and begins to go for the blade.

04:50:46.047 --> 04:50:47.615
JOE: I go straight for him.

04:50:47.615 --> 04:50:50.400
MATT: You go straight for him?

04:50:50.400 --> 04:50:52.309
JOE: With the death knight? Straight for him.

04:50:52.309 --> 04:50:57.250
MATT: Gilmore reaches out to you and casts Haste
on you.

04:50:57.250 --> 04:50:58.366
TRAVIS: Haste?!

04:50:58.366 --> 04:51:00.614
(gasps)

04:51:00.614 --> 04:51:02.318
MATT: "But it lasts a minute. Hurry!"

04:51:02.318 --> 04:51:06.510
MARISHA: I hate to say this but Arkhan do you have
him?

04:51:06.510 --> 04:51:08.519
JOE: Get upstairs! I'll hold him off!

04:51:08.519 --> 04:51:09.836
MARISHA: Let's go!

04:51:09.836 --> 04:51:18.517
LIAM: Bless. Shaun! It was an honor knowing you.

04:51:18.517 --> 04:51:24.174
MATT: "It will be an honor knowing you all still."
Grabbing on to both of the girls and with a flash

04:51:24.174 --> 04:51:29.901
of light, the three of them vanish. The death
knight has turned to reach out and goes to cast

04:51:29.901 --> 04:51:34.279
something. Arkhan rushes up and slams the axe
across his arm, knocking it aside. You can see

04:51:34.279 --> 04:51:39.111
now, behind them, other cultists and other things
begin to head up the stairs. But they're currently

04:51:39.111 --> 04:51:42.349
being choked at this point where the death
knight's being held at the stairway where Arkhan

04:51:42.349 --> 04:51:43.971
is stepping there.

04:51:43.971 --> 04:51:48.361
JOE: Zombies are grabbing for his arms.

04:51:48.361 --> 04:51:52.736
MATT: As Arkhan holds off, you guys head up
towards the top of the tower. That's where we're

04:51:52.736 --> 04:51:54.100
going to pick up next week.

04:51:54.100 --> 04:51:58.482
(screaming)

04:51:58.482 --> 04:52:03.468
TRAVIS: What did you do?! You Kevin Spacey from
Seven mother fucker! What did you do?

04:52:03.468 --> 04:52:13.912
MATT: When you revealed to a god how close and
dangerous you were last game, there were going to

04:52:13.912 --> 04:52:15.193
be repercussions.

04:52:15.193 --> 04:52:17.699
TRAVIS: (terrified laughter) Oh my god!

04:52:17.699 --> 04:52:21.763
MATT: And he knows how to get to you. He knows
your secrets.

04:52:21.763 --> 04:52:25.760
LIAM: This is a great game!

04:52:25.760 --> 04:52:30.773
JOE: This is the most fun I've ever had!

04:52:30.773 --> 04:52:34.089
(laughter)

04:52:34.089 --> 04:52:43.448
MATT: I love you guys. We'll pick this up next
week for what will most likely be the final

04:52:43.448 --> 04:52:44.447
battle.

04:52:44.447 --> 04:52:46.079
SAM: Ashley, can you pipe in?

04:52:46.079 --> 04:52:47.909
ASHLEY: I don't know yet. I don't know the
schedule.

04:52:47.909 --> 04:52:53.673
MATT: If any of you are watching are from
Blindspot, find a way to not have her work

04:52:53.673 --> 04:53:05.200
Thursday evening, please. That went a little
longer than we anticipated, but we're at the end

04:53:05.200 --> 04:53:06.475
of the campaign.

04:53:06.475 --> 04:53:10.075
LIAM: Joe Manganiello!

04:53:10.075 --> 04:53:13.328
(cheering)

04:53:13.328 --> 04:53:23.752
JOE: Jocks. We're here. Get used to it.

04:53:23.752 --> 04:53:26.658
(laughter)

04:53:26.658 --> 04:53:33.266
JOE: Thank you so much for having me.

04:53:33.266 --> 04:53:35.385
MATT: Of course! Thanks for coming.

04:53:35.385 --> 04:53:38.000
TALIESIN: I've been looking forward to this.

04:53:38.000 --> 04:53:43.444
TRAVIS: You're welcome! Any time.

04:53:43.444 --> 04:53:44.991
JOE: Tiamat: she ain't so bad.

04:53:44.991 --> 04:53:55.443
MATT: Well, she's pretty fucking bad. But when
your goals are aligned, it can be useful. Well

04:53:55.443 --> 04:53:59.814
guys, thank you for joining us for this extended
episode leading into the final fray of the

04:53:59.814 --> 04:54:05.821
campaign. I'm so excited for next week.

04:54:05.821 --> 04:54:12.777
TALIESIN: Everything's downhill from here. It'll
be super easy.

04:54:12.777 --> 04:54:16.011
TRAVIS: You've got surprises and then you've got
&lt;i&gt;that shit.&lt;/i&gt;

04:54:16.011 --> 04:54:18.820
LIAM: That was fucked up.

04:54:18.820 --> 04:54:26.510
TALIESIN: I was feeling weird about it.

04:54:26.510 --> 04:54:31.041
JOE: I was going to cut his head off. I thought he
was some kind of sentinel. He was seeing through

04:54:31.041 --> 04:54:33.740
his eyes or whatever. I was about to chop his head
off.

04:54:33.740 --> 04:54:35.660
TRAVIS: Thank god you rolled a one.

04:54:35.660 --> 04:54:39.843
JOE: That was the luckiest one.

04:54:39.843 --> 04:54:41.693
MATT: That was a lucky fucking one, dude!

04:54:41.693 --> 04:54:49.929
LIAM: Next campaign, we don't attack anybody! We
talk to everybody! Every NPC, every hot dog

04:54:49.929 --> 04:54:53.238
vender, every lich! Talk!

04:54:53.238 --> 04:54:59.115
MATT: That was a fucked-up tactic is what it was.

04:54:59.115 --> 04:55:03.287
LIAM: Fucked up! You managed in the space of a
week to make the choke-out seem like child's play!

04:55:03.287 --> 04:55:06.593
TALIESIN: You are a monster.

04:55:06.593 --> 04:55:08.777
MATT: Vecna is a monster, guys.

04:55:08.777 --> 04:55:10.577
TALIESIN: I'm so proud.

04:55:10.577 --> 04:55:16.249
JOE: My undead brother I'm dragging around with
me! This is fucking so fucked up!

04:55:16.249 --> 04:55:19.204
(laughter)

04:55:19.204 --> 04:55:26.481
MATT: Well, thank you guys, hope you had a good
time. We'll see you guys next week. Have a

04:55:26.481 --> 04:55:29.545
wonderful night, and is it Thursday yet? Bye!

04:55:29.545 --> 04:55:31.463
MARISHA: Congrats to our t-shirt winners!

04:55:31.463 --> 05:02:21.514
