(giggling)

00:00:03.775 --> 00:00:15.611
TRAVIS: We're fucking doing this. Hello! Welcome
to this evening's episode of Critical Role. I will

00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:20.410
be your DM for the evening. My name is Travis
Willingham, and this is where a bunch of us

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.651
nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:26.433
TALIESIN: This feels sacrilege.

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:33.358
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. I'm going to soil this seat all
night long. Just soil it and make it mine.

00:00:33.358 --> 00:00:41.922
Welcome! Tonight you will be enjoying a game DM'ed
by my Critical Role character, Grog. Certainly not

00:00:41.922 --> 00:00:48.800
me. Any mistakes I make, I am not responsible for.
It is all Grog's fault. Tonight's episode is

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.402
brought to you by a wonderful sponsor, Marvel
Puzzle Quest! Sam!

00:00:52.402 --> 00:01:00.226
SAM: In honor of Marvel Puzzle Quest sponsoring
this episode, we actually had Grog write the

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.710
advertising copy.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.277
TRAVIS: I remember that, yeah.

00:01:03.277 --> 00:01:10.581
SAM: It starts like this. I am Grog. I smash
things and people. Sometimes, I use a hammer, much

00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:17.062
like another big man named Thor! Thor is not a
goliath, but he is strong, almost as strong as

00:01:17.062 --> 00:01:24.323
Grog. I like Thor because his name is easy to say.
Thor is on a quest to a place called Marvel

00:01:24.323 --> 00:01:30.627
Puzzle. This Marvel Puzzle Quest must be magic,
because it happens only on telly-phones and

00:01:30.627 --> 00:01:37.858
inty-nets. You have to press buttons to rage.
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard! Inspired

00:01:37.858 --> 00:01:46.959
by Thor's rock, he calls it Ragnarock, the Sakaar
Arena event is going on, where you team up with

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:52.101
Thor in 20-person lightning rounds for prizes.
Grog would not have to team up with anyone to win

00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:58.475
in any arena, because Grog is already the champion
named Philip. You can load-down this Marvel Puzzle

00:01:58.475 --> 00:02:07.815
Quest for free! That means no gold, Vax-- Vex.
Fuck! You can download it at the Apple Store. I

00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:16.667
like apples! Google Play. I like to play! Or the
Amazon app store. I like amazons. Or Steam! I

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:22.185
don't like steam. It is angry water and it makes
my face hurt. Also, ale. The end.

00:02:22.185 --> 00:02:25.979
LIAM: How did you do that without moving your
mouth?

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:30.057
TRAVIS: It was a long online tutoring session that
Sam paid a lot of money for.

00:02:30.057 --> 00:02:31.774
SAM: Pike wrote it down.

00:02:31.774 --> 00:02:34.691
TRAVIS: Yeah, Pike got it all down, that's right.
Thank you, Sam.

00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:37.020
LAURA: That sounded just like him.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.751
SAM: My voice acting is good.

00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:45.300
TRAVIS: Right?! It's super good. Announcements! Do
we have some merches?

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.065
LAURA: Oh, well! In addition to our Vox Machina
dice that came out last week, we've got this

00:02:51.065 --> 00:02:55.696
amazing, oh, you know, "How do you want to do
this?" scarf! I think I'm holding it upside down.

00:02:55.696 --> 00:03:01.620
How do you want to do this! Yeah, yours is out in
the kitchen.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.935
LIAM: It is soft.

00:03:02.935 --> 00:03:07.404
LAURA: It's soft and wonderful. We wanted this
last year for Christmas or holidays, and then it

00:03:07.404 --> 00:03:11.557
didn't happen, so it's this year and it's
beautiful and amazing.

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:14.592
LIAM: It's not one of those scritchy-scratchy
scarves. It's soft.

00:03:14.592 --> 00:03:19.474
TALIESIN: It's even what passes for cold out here
in beautiful California.

00:03:19.474 --> 00:03:22.622
LAURA: If it's not cold, you can hang it on your
wall. It's a good banner.

00:03:22.622 --> 00:03:25.455
TRAVIS: It looks so nice.

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:27.305
LAURA: It's beautiful and we love it.

00:03:27.305 --> 00:03:28.552
TRAVIS: That's gorgeous.

00:03:28.552 --> 00:03:35.020
LAURA: Isn't it? You could wear it with your
hoodie, or a t-shirt, or some Critical Role socks.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.229
You could wear it with your Critical Role hat and
be full-on-- oh my god, I want to see someone

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:41.487
decked full.

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:43.281
SAM: That would be amazing. Wearing all the
shirts.

00:03:43.281 --> 00:03:46.544
LAURA: All the shirts, and the hoodie, and the
hat, and maybe the necklace.

00:03:46.544 --> 00:03:48.143
TALIESIN: And it's on Twitter.

00:03:48.143 --> 00:03:53.790
SAM: Did we ever have socks? We have socks. I
don't own the socks!

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.278
LAURA: I have so many extra pairs at home.

00:03:56.278 --> 00:04:00.269
TALIESIN: It was your pun! You were the one who
demanded Socks Machina.

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.030
LAURA: I was the one who was supposed to pass them
out, but then I didn't.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.280
TRAVIS: Other announcements. Some of you will be
attending PAX Unplugged in Philadelphia. Is that

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.671
correct? Yes? Who?

00:04:11.671 --> 00:04:13.940
LIAM: M &amp; M, and you and I, Tal.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.065
TALIESIN: Yes, M &amp; M and L &amp; T.

00:04:16.065 --> 00:04:19.011
LIAM: Not Marshall Mathers. We meant Matt and
Marisha.

00:04:19.011 --> 00:04:22.594
TRAVIS: Matt and Marisha. Yeah. It's November--

00:04:22.594 --> 00:04:24.053
TALIESIN: It's in two weeks.

00:04:24.053 --> 00:04:26.342
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't remember the exact date--

00:04:26.342 --> 00:04:28.455
TALIESIN: The weekend of November 17th.

00:04:28.455 --> 00:04:32.365
TRAVIS: Right. Friday, I think, everything is on?
If you're going to PAX Unplugged, find these

00:04:32.365 --> 00:04:39.067
patsies and go and see them. They will be there.
Patsies? I said Pats Unplugged, so I tried to play

00:04:39.067 --> 00:04:42.484
it off of Patsy. We will be in Australia. We'll be
at Supanova.

00:04:42.484 --> 00:04:44.324
LAURA: Yeah, the other L &amp; T!

00:04:44.324 --> 00:04:47.378
TRAVIS: That's right! For two weeks in November,
we'll be at Adelaide and Brisbane. So, if you're

00:04:47.378 --> 00:04:49.180
Down Under, come see us.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.275
LAURA: How you feeling, baby?

00:04:51.275 --> 00:04:56.282
TRAVIS: Oh man, this is terrible. This is awful.
This is great.

00:04:56.282 --> 00:04:58.700
LAURA: I can see this long-distance stare.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.593
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, thousand-yard stare? Pretty much.
Anything else? What am I forgetting?

00:05:02.593 --> 00:05:09.145
LIAM: Couple things. Next week, Marisha will be in
your chair, running a game of Honey Heist.

00:05:09.145 --> 00:05:11.337
TRAVIS: No idea what that is.

00:05:11.337 --> 00:05:13.284
LIAM: We're all bears.

00:05:13.284 --> 00:05:14.789
LAURA: Except Travis and I won't be there.

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:15.931
SAM: We're all bears?

00:05:15.931 --> 00:05:18.866
LIAM: They're not bears, but the three of us and
everyone else who's going to be here are going to

00:05:18.866 --> 00:05:21.571
be bears. It's the worst episode for you not to be
here.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.662
LAURA: I know! I'm missing the Honey Heist!

00:05:23.662 --> 00:05:28.248
TRAVIS: Yes. Oh, we do have one last announcement.
We are excited to announce the Critical Role: Vox

00:05:28.248 --> 00:05:34.103
Machina wrap-up. Yes. It's the pearly gates Q&amp;A
session we've been talking about since day one. It

00:05:34.103 --> 00:05:40.095
will be a Talks Machina episode hosted by the
illustrious and never-stinky Brian W. Foster. Live

00:05:40.095 --> 00:05:43.573
Thursday, December 14th, in the normal Critical
Role time slot.

00:05:43.573 --> 00:05:45.313
LAURA: So that's a Thursday.

00:05:45.313 --> 00:05:49.297
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll be discussing the entirety of
the Vox Machina campaign.

00:05:49.297 --> 00:05:51.823
LAURA: That means we get to ask Matt all of the
secrets, and he has to tell us?

00:05:51.823 --> 00:05:56.380
SAM: And we can ask each other, too! I'm going to
read that letter that I wrote to Pike! All kinds

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.780
of shit.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.322
TRAVIS: And the note that I have says, "Please
keep an eye on various social medias as we will be

00:06:02.322 --> 00:06:11.360
"breaking up the question submissions into five
story arcs." So more info to come on that. Yep.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.683
TALIESIN: There are a few other-- I don't know if
they gave you the full page.

00:06:13.683 --> 00:06:15.914
LAURA: Do we all get to talk as Grog tonight?

00:06:15.914 --> 00:06:17.657
TALIESIN: (Grog voice) I think so, yeah.

00:06:17.657 --> 00:06:21.614
TRAVIS: You can, but it might get you killed.

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:26.763
TALIESIN: There's a few other things that
happened, also. The Critical Role podcast got

00:06:26.763 --> 00:06:34.198
updated today. It now goes to 70, I believe. We're
now at episode 70. It goes all the way to 70 now.

00:06:34.198 --> 00:06:35.744
I know, it's great.

00:06:35.744 --> 00:06:37.699
TRAVIS: I know what that number is.

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.025
TALIESIN: We're also, some of us are going to be
at BlizzCon tomorrow.

00:06:41.025 --> 00:06:43.431
LAURA: Oh, that's right!

00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:52.424
TALIESIN: You can find us. There's a Geek and
Sundry panel at 4:00 on the Epic stage at

00:06:52.424 --> 00:06:56.819
BlizzCon. I have this in my head. Now that I don't
have a game in my head, all of this new

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:03.127
information has flooded through. Also, Phil LaMarr
is coming onto the Wednesday Club next week to

00:07:03.127 --> 00:07:10.222
talk Thor and his hammer. It's going to be fun. I
was asked to inform everyone that there's going to

00:07:10.222 --> 00:07:15.330
be no Gather Your Party, because BlizzCon, so
instead it's going to be Tales from the Loop with

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:21.221
Amy Dallen, Vorpahl, Sax, Rachel, Gina, and Kelly
Del Angelo is going to be GMing, and it's going to

00:07:21.221 --> 00:07:23.894
be nuts. That'll be Friday while we're partying at
BlizzCon.

00:07:23.894 --> 00:07:32.121
LAURA: Can I say one more? What? It was just
announced that I joined the cast of Last of Us 2!

00:07:32.121 --> 00:07:35.801
LIAM: Look at these guns!

00:07:35.801 --> 00:07:39.534
SAM: Everyone, do your Laura Bailey impression!

00:07:39.534 --> 00:07:48.916
LAURA: Check out that trailer if you feel like
feeling shaky and, yeah. It's pretty brutal.

00:07:48.916 --> 00:07:50.757
SAM: She plays the car that's on fire.

00:07:50.757 --> 00:07:51.825
LAURA: That's right.

00:07:51.825 --> 00:07:53.364
LIAM: Feel-good game of the year.

00:07:53.364 --> 00:07:54.481
LAURA: I'm very excited.

00:07:54.481 --> 00:07:57.343
TRAVIS: And you haven't told me anything about it.
Nothing.

00:07:57.343 --> 00:07:59.171
LIAM: Did you even know she was in the game?

00:07:59.171 --> 00:08:00.487
TRAVIS: In what game?

00:08:00.487 --> 00:08:03.164
LAURA: It's all NDAs, you know. We're not allowed
to share it with anybody.

00:08:03.164 --> 00:08:11.968
LIAM: No duh! Also, tomorrow will be the first
character playlist. It will be mine, so you can

00:08:11.968 --> 00:08:13.870
find it sometime tomorrow.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.148
SAM: Shit, I never did mine.

00:08:15.148 --> 00:08:16.471
LIAM: You've got time!

00:08:16.471 --> 00:08:18.771
TRAVIS: Yeah, I didn't do it. I barely did this.

00:08:18.771 --> 00:08:21.100
LIAM: It'll drop sometime tomorrow.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.295
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay!

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:28.932
TRAVIS: Anything else? Is that it? Okay. I guess
if we have no other distractions--

00:08:28.932 --> 00:08:36.524
LIAM: Madness! Yeah, episode two dropped on
Project Alpha today. It's pretty great, it's

00:08:36.524 --> 00:08:37.832
pretty spooky.

00:08:37.832 --> 00:08:42.972
LAURA: I want to point out that Keyleth's dice
just rolled a one. No, I don't have my dice jail

00:08:42.972 --> 00:08:49.862
with me. But I rolled an 18 on my own personal
dice. I rolled the best. No, Matt's roll was a

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:52.969
natural 20. So those ones stay out.

00:08:52.969 --> 00:08:57.280
TRAVIS: All right, fuck it! No more stalling! It's
time for you guys to die. With that, we're going

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:12.416
to roll some credits for tonight's episode of
(long inhale) Critical Role. (guttural noises)

00:09:12.416 --> 00:10:42.830
[dramatic music]

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:50.995
TRAVIS: I like that. I expected a little bit more. We
start this game as you guys playing your

00:10:50.995 --> 00:10:57.727
characters. Grog has asked all of his members, all
of his fellow warriors in Vox Machina, to join him

00:10:57.727 --> 00:11:03.907
in Scanlan's Magnificent Mansion for a game that
he has heard about.

00:11:03.907 --> 00:11:07.442
SAM: You're turning into Grog right now?

00:11:07.442 --> 00:11:13.453
TRAVIS: What? Yeah. Oh my god! Guys, you're all
here! Oh, thank god. Did anyone have the salad?

00:11:13.453 --> 00:11:21.275
SAM: Yeah, yes, they just whipped up a fresh batch
of tzatziki sauce to go with it.

00:11:21.275 --> 00:11:25.664
TRAVIS: Chicken, did anybody have the chicken
instead of the salad?

00:11:25.664 --> 00:11:27.505
LAURA: No chicken. There's no more chicken, Grog.

00:11:27.505 --> 00:11:32.884
TRAVIS: I was making sure it wasn't me. Hey, look,
I know we've got a night to ourselves. I was

00:11:32.884 --> 00:11:36.311
wondering if maybe we could all, like, play a game
I heard about.

00:11:36.311 --> 00:11:39.974
SAM: I mean, should I go wake up the others?

00:11:39.974 --> 00:11:47.070
TRAVIS: No, no. I don't think so. It's a little
above their head. Yeah, it's only for us big

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:53.154
thinkers. Okay. Yeah. So, I was in this tavern the
other day, right? And I heard about this game. I

00:11:53.154 --> 00:11:59.628
think it's called Bunions and Flagons, right. And
you are all going to play as little, itty-bitty

00:11:59.628 --> 00:12:04.978
versions of yourselves. All you got to do is use
your imagination. Right? I'm going to tell you a

00:12:04.978 --> 00:12:10.024
story and then you contribute, tell me what you
want to do, and I draw out little maps, and we'll

00:12:10.024 --> 00:12:11.022
go on an adventure.

00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:12.483
LAURA: So we're, like, baby versions of
ourselves?

00:12:12.483 --> 00:12:15.891
TRAVIS: No, it's like, the size of your thumb,
like tiny. We're going to move them around. Yeah.

00:12:15.891 --> 00:12:19.331
LIAM: Like Tiny Vax, but tiny everybody, this time?

00:12:19.331 --> 00:12:23.023
SAM: Grog, I'm already tiny. Even tinier?

00:12:23.023 --> 00:12:25.368
LAURA: You'll be the size of a pinky, maybe.

00:12:25.368 --> 00:12:29.695
TRAVIS: Yeah, you know, you're tiny, but you've
got a big, uh, heart. What do you think?

00:12:29.695 --> 00:12:33.267
SAM: It sounds great. I mean, this is so unlike
you.

00:12:33.267 --> 00:12:36.890
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, you know, I've been thinking
about it for a long time. I actually made art for

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:46.025
each of you guys, so like, I made Percy, right,
and then I made Vex. Right, with the ears and the

00:12:46.025 --> 00:12:57.007
arrows. And then there's Vax'ildan, with his
little ears bleeding. Then the Scanlan.

00:12:57.007 --> 00:12:59.225
LAURA: That looks just like you!

00:12:59.225 --> 00:13:01.361
SAM: The eyes are haunting.

00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:03.200
LIAM: That's drawn to scale, that one.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:09.243
SAM: That's amazing! Wait, did you draw Grog? I
guess you're not playing with us? How does this work?

00:13:09.243 --> 00:13:11.790
TRAVIS: Oh shit. No, I am playing with you. I'll
be there.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:17.903
LIAM: Is there a ball involved in this game? A
ball? Games are typically-- ball, a ball.

00:13:17.903 --> 00:13:22.435
TRAVIS: Not a bowl, but a ball. Not a bowl you eat
out of, but a ball.

00:13:22.435 --> 00:13:28.672
LIAM: Not that my father ever played catch with
me, but you know, the type of ball that one would

00:13:28.672 --> 00:13:31.961
play catch with, with one's father, if they gave a
shit.

00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:34.101
TRAVIS: No, no ball.

00:13:34.101 --> 00:13:36.264
LIAM: What kind of game is it, then?

00:13:36.264 --> 00:13:40.070
TRAVIS: I'm going to put everything on this big
table in front of us. It'll be right in front of

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.916
you, and you get to sit in your chair.

00:13:41.916 --> 00:13:43.202
TALIESIN: Like cards, then?

00:13:43.202 --> 00:13:44.477
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's pretty nice.

00:13:44.477 --> 00:13:47.286
LAURA: Can your servants bring over some liquor?
Because I think we're going to need it.

00:13:47.286 --> 00:13:49.712
SAM: Keep the wine coming!

00:13:49.712 --> 00:13:55.178
TRAVIS: Yeah, always a good idea, when playing
this game, to drink heavily.

00:13:55.178 --> 00:13:56.519
LIAM: Vegan wine, yeah.

00:13:56.519 --> 00:13:59.137
TRAVIS: Yes, all right, so.

00:13:59.137 --> 00:14:02.685
SAM: I should warn you, I'm a power gamer.

00:14:02.685 --> 00:14:04.879
TRAVIS: Power gamer?

00:14:04.879 --> 00:14:06.879
SAM: Yeah, you know, I get really into it.

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:14.597
TRAVIS: In your brain theaters, all right, I want
you to imagine that Vox Machina has been

00:14:14.597 --> 00:14:17.836
successful on its latest mission. We are
triumphant!

00:14:17.836 --> 00:14:19.103
LAURA: As always.

00:14:19.103 --> 00:14:25.414
TRAVIS: As always. It's the wee hours of the
morning, and we have found our way to a tavern.

00:14:25.414 --> 00:14:33.301
Small, maybe off the beaten path, right. It's
shambly outside. We go in and it's deserted,

00:14:33.301 --> 00:14:38.037
right? There's only like one other couple in the
whole fucking place. We got the run of the lot. We

00:14:38.037 --> 00:14:44.232
go in. It's time to drink. We're raising glasses,
we're cheering, we're drinking. Everybody's

00:14:44.232 --> 00:14:48.677
boozing, right? Yeah! Who wants to make a toast?

00:14:48.677 --> 00:14:50.785
LIAM: This is the game?

00:14:50.785 --> 00:14:59.082
SAM: I'll make a toast. I'll make a toast, yeah.
(clears throat) Right then! My character has a

00:14:59.082 --> 00:15:01.030
different accent than Scanlan does.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:02.729
TRAVIS: You're just playing you, though.

00:15:02.729 --> 00:15:04.644
SAM: Well, I know, but I want to get into it,
right?

00:15:04.644 --> 00:15:06.023
LAURA: No, I like it.

00:15:06.023 --> 00:15:13.335
SAM: Right then, we did a really good job in the
fight today! So I think that we should all propose

00:15:13.335 --> 00:15:23.578
a toast to the one that fell. Keyleth. I'm sorry
she'll never be joining us again. To Keyleth.

00:15:23.578 --> 00:15:26.288
LIAM: That's an odd story choice to make.

00:15:26.288 --> 00:15:35.220
TRAVIS: Cheers, yeah. To Keyleth. Underpowered her
whole life, really. Nothing at her disposal.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.723
LIAM: The last of us.

00:15:36.723 --> 00:15:41.971
TRAVIS: May her memory live forever.

00:15:41.971 --> 00:15:43.377
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:43.377 --> 00:15:51.163
TRAVIS: As we are drinking, and we're on, like--
What's a big number? Our second cup. Everybody's

00:15:51.163 --> 00:15:57.884
really starting to feel it a little bit,
especially our little gnome, Pike. Pike gets up on

00:15:57.884 --> 00:16:07.156
the table, right. She's like-- Pike! Flower! My
friend. Pike gets up and she's like, "You guys, I

00:16:07.156 --> 00:16:11.013
"love being your friend."

00:16:11.013 --> 00:16:14.127
TALIESIN: Too real.

00:16:14.127 --> 00:16:16.368
LIAM: The dimensional distortion there for a
second!

00:16:16.368 --> 00:16:25.421
TRAVIS: "I'm really, like, all of your friend! You
are good!" And she turns to you, Vex, yeah, and

00:16:25.494 --> 00:16:34.121
she's like, "You know, we're so close! And you
know, I--" (gulping) And you start to see, right,

00:16:34.121 --> 00:16:39.013
that maybe she's had one too many, which is really
saying something for that little tank. She goes,

00:16:39.013 --> 00:16:45.778
"Ah, nope. I got it-- urp!" And in that moment you
start to see all the color come up to her face. I

00:16:45.778 --> 00:16:48.482
need you to roll a dexterity check.

00:16:48.482 --> 00:16:49.601
LAURA: Okay.

00:16:49.601 --> 00:16:52.138
SAM: What does that mean? What's a dexterity
check?

00:16:52.138 --> 00:16:53.879
TRAVIS: I don't know, I heard a guy at the bar say
it.

00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:59.846
LAURA: I'm going to roll one of these fancy gems
that I have. All right. Oh, that's really good! Oh

00:16:59.846 --> 00:17:09.657
wait, just a check? 11 plus-- 18. No, 29! That
means it's 29.

00:17:09.657 --> 00:17:11.387
SAM: How do you know what to add?

00:17:11.387 --> 00:17:13.785
LAURA: I'm really smart! I'm very smart.

00:17:13.785 --> 00:17:19.720
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally, right. So, 29, that's
great! At the last moment you see what is bound to

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:24.931
be a shoot of vomit in your face and you just,
boop! Duck out of the way. She catches it with her

00:17:24.931 --> 00:17:29.036
lips and this little stream of bile comes, like,
shooting out and goes over your shoulder.

00:17:29.036 --> 00:17:34.403
LAURA: I want to grab a glass and try to catch it
in a mug. So it doesn't get all over the floor,

00:17:34.403 --> 00:17:35.442
you know.

00:17:35.442 --> 00:17:39.640
TRAVIS: You raise the glass right in front of her
face. As she sees it, she sees more alcohol in the

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:46.800
glass, and she goes, "Mm!" and turns away, and
paints the bar. Except that other couple that was

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:53.278
in the bar with you, they're right in the path of
her destruction. Yeah. And she Alphabits and

00:17:53.278 --> 00:18:01.252
Lucky Charms all over the place. All over the
table on this couple. You see, as this gentleman,

00:18:01.252 --> 00:18:10.591
this greenish-skinned with large lower teeth and a
hood and a cloak, stands up and starts to turn

00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:15.793
toward you. He's like, "What the fuck?"

00:18:15.793 --> 00:18:20.863
LAURA: &lt;i&gt;So&lt;/i&gt; sorry about all of the vomit.

00:18:20.863 --> 00:18:22.919
TRAVIS: "Yeah. Is she with you?"

00:18:22.919 --> 00:18:24.450
LAURA: Yes, she is.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:30.919
TRAVIS: Well, I'm sure you guys are going to take
care of this, right? I mean, it's in my drink,

00:18:30.919 --> 00:18:36.429
"it's on my food, it's on my--" And you see with
him is also this very lovely lady. She's got

00:18:36.429 --> 00:18:42.464
slightly bluish skin and she is also, like,
staring in revulsion at all of this mess that

00:18:42.464 --> 00:18:47.503
she's wearing. Right? It's on her. Maybe there's a
little bit hanging off of her lip. She starts to

00:18:47.503 --> 00:18:50.274
go, "Wha-- (gulping) what--"

00:18:50.274 --> 00:18:54.783
LAURA: Oh, no! I hold the cup under her mouth as
well.

00:18:54.783 --> 00:19:01.175
TRAVIS: She holds it in, but this really
infuriates this half-orc looking gentleman. He

00:19:01.175 --> 00:19:09.401
stands up, right? and he's like, "That's it. You
and I-- You! You and I, we're coming to blows. I

00:19:09.401 --> 00:19:11.100
"want answers for this."

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.872
LIAM: I was just standing here!

00:19:13.872 --> 00:19:18.080
TRAVIS: "Nope, I've stood up! I'm making a point
that doesn't make any difference, and I'm too

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.837
"embarrassed to back down now."

00:19:19.837 --> 00:19:24.102
LIAM: Yes, but wait one second. Grog, you're very
good at this. Have you been spending time at the

00:19:24.102 --> 00:19:25.933
theater and not telling us?

00:19:25.933 --> 00:19:27.614
TRAVIS: What's a theater?

00:19:27.614 --> 00:19:33.371
LIAM: Let's fight this fucking guy! What do I do?
Do I actually use this, or what do I do? Are we

00:19:33.371 --> 00:19:34.496
fighting?

00:19:34.496 --> 00:19:37.936
TRAVIS: Nope, imagination weapons. Yeah. You tell
me what you want to do.

00:19:37.936 --> 00:19:42.829
LIAM: I would like to poke him in the eyes.

00:19:42.829 --> 00:19:44.065
TRAVIS: With what?

00:19:44.065 --> 00:19:45.101
LIAM: These.

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:51.299
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah! Okay. So, you, yeah! Take one of
those big, globular, like, d20 dices.

00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:56.555
LIAM: All right, I'm going to use this weird--

00:19:56.555 --> 00:19:58.616
TRAVIS: The mansion provides.

00:19:58.616 --> 00:20:00.901
LIAM: I'm going to use this weird purple one,
where you can't read the numbers on it.

00:20:00.901 --> 00:20:02.779
TRAVIS: Roll to hit.

00:20:02.779 --> 00:20:07.930
LIAM: I think it says 13. And what?

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:15.780
TRAVIS: The servants bring over a sheet that has
modifiers for you to use. Yeah. These are things

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.107
you add.

00:20:17.107 --> 00:20:18.608
LAURA: What do you add to it?

00:20:18.608 --> 00:20:25.794
LIAM: I think I'm improvising this weapon, is that
accurate? All right, so I would add, I have no

00:20:25.794 --> 00:20:28.910
fucking idea. You know what I'm going to do? I'm
going to add my wisdom modifier.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:31.661
LAURA: Why wisdom? No, it's strength!

00:20:31.661 --> 00:20:32.914
LIAM: Why would I add anything?

00:20:32.914 --> 00:20:34.155
TRAVIS: He's pretty wise.

00:20:34.155 --> 00:20:40.384
LIAM: How strong are my fingers? Is that the
point? Sure, I'll add my strength to my fingers.

00:20:40.384 --> 00:20:42.323
So 15.

00:20:42.323 --> 00:20:47.397
TRAVIS: 15? That's all you need. You, boink, right
in his eyes, and he's like, "Argh! In the eyes!"

00:20:47.397 --> 00:20:50.629
LIAM: That's fucking hilarious.

00:20:50.629 --> 00:20:56.596
TRAVIS: Right. The girl stands up at the table and
she's like, "No! No, please! Not his eyes!"

00:20:56.596 --> 00:20:58.940
LIAM: I have four of these.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.951
TRAVIS: Right, and she sees you standing there,
ready to go, and she's like, "No, please, please!"

00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:04.422
LIAM: You threaten me all the time!

00:21:04.422 --> 00:21:06.053
LAURA: Yeah, but she doesn't have any weapons on
her!

00:21:06.053 --> 00:21:07.201
LIAM: Neither do I!

00:21:07.201 --> 00:21:09.714
TRAVIS: Actually, do you want to see if she has
any weapons?

00:21:09.714 --> 00:21:11.871
LAURA: Oh, well I'm very perceptive, Grog. You
know that.

00:21:11.871 --> 00:21:14.552
TRAVIS: Oh, you are perceptive. Right. Roll a
perception check.

00:21:14.552 --> 00:21:15.766
LAURA: Okay.

00:21:15.766 --> 00:21:18.126
LIAM: This game thinks of everything.

00:21:18.126 --> 00:21:20.905
LAURA: A 31.

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:26.034
TRAVIS: You don't see anything, unfortunately.
That's just unfortunate.

00:21:26.034 --> 00:21:32.233
LAURA: Grog, 31 is higher than 15. 31's really
high. It's high.

00:21:32.233 --> 00:21:37.865
TRAVIS: Right, so you see her genealogy going
back, like, four generations.

00:21:37.865 --> 00:21:40.880
LAURA: Do you even know what genealogy is?

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:47.524
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's like, you know, a blue denim.
Yeah. So you see at her side this spear that's

00:21:47.524 --> 00:21:52.089
laying up against the table. Yeah, yeah. I don't
know how you missed it the first time. It's a

00:21:52.089 --> 00:21:56.964
fucking spear, right there. She stands up and
she's like, "No, no, please! No more eye-poking!"

00:21:56.964 --> 00:22:02.983
SAM: Grog, Grog! I'm going to try to turn
invisible, if that's all right. Can I just do that?

00:22:02.983 --> 00:22:05.342
TRAVIS: I don't know. Can you just do that, or do
you roll?

00:22:05.342 --> 00:22:06.696
SAM: I normally just do that.

00:22:06.696 --> 00:22:08.535
TRAVIS: Okay. Go invisible.

00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:13.252
SAM: All right, I'm going to go invisible and I'm going
to try to swipe the spear before she gets to it.

00:22:13.252 --> 00:22:15.509
TRAVIS: Okay. Roll a stealth check.

00:22:15.509 --> 00:22:24.205
SAM: Okay. Seven, plus-- ten. So, it's ten. This
many.

00:22:24.205 --> 00:22:28.016
TRAVIS: Ten total? Okay, great. So you go
invisible, right, and you walk over behind the

00:22:28.016 --> 00:22:33.155
blue-skinned lady and right as you get to the
spear, you grab for it, but there's something that

00:22:33.155 --> 00:22:36.870
catches your eye and you fumble the spear and it
falls to the ground.

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.807
SAM: Oh shite, I dropped the spear!

00:22:39.807 --> 00:22:47.529
TRAVIS: Good, I love it. As she hears the spear
fall, she turns and she swings her hand wildly,

00:22:47.529 --> 00:22:54.105
catching you dead in the face. Boom! Knocks you
back. You fly back onto your back five feet. You

00:22:54.105 --> 00:22:56.617
take two points of damage.

00:22:56.617 --> 00:22:58.926
LIAM: You're intelligent. Do you understand what
is happening?

00:22:58.926 --> 00:23:03.782
TALIESIN: Not in the least. None of this makes any
sense. These numbers seem completely arbitrary.

00:23:03.782 --> 00:23:07.377
SAM: He's so good at this, though! I feel like we
should keep supporting this!

00:23:07.377 --> 00:23:09.588
LAURA: I feel like we're in a tavern right now.

00:23:09.588 --> 00:23:12.311
TALIESIN: I think he might have eaten
something in the back. This is not normal.

00:23:12.311 --> 00:23:16.997
SAM: He's never been good at anything intellectual
and now this is it! So maybe we should support him

00:23:16.997 --> 00:23:18.699
and go with it.

00:23:18.699 --> 00:23:23.091
TRAVIS: Scanlan, the reason that you fumbled for
the spear is that you saw this small little bundle

00:23:23.091 --> 00:23:25.804
next to her chair. In fact, it looks like--

00:23:25.804 --> 00:23:27.061
LAURA: Is it a baby?

00:23:27.061 --> 00:23:30.958
TRAVIS: It looks like a small baby, all swaddled
up in cloth. No, small.

00:23:30.958 --> 00:23:32.890
TALIESIN: Is the baby also covered in vomit?

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:36.532
LAURA: Wait, I have a question. Are we teeny at
this moment, or are we normal sized?

00:23:36.532 --> 00:23:40.713
TRAVIS: No, yeah, I'm going to put this out like,
what's that game where you move the--?

00:23:40.713 --> 00:23:42.015
SAM: Sorry?

00:23:42.015 --> 00:23:46.835
LAURA: Parcheesi? Checkers? Chess?

00:23:46.835 --> 00:23:49.748
TRAVIS: Yeah, that one! We'll be like that on a
big map.

00:23:49.748 --> 00:23:56.330
SAM: Really quickly into my earring, I say: She's
got a baby with her!

00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:03.425
LAURA: Oh. Are we going to fight a baby now?

00:24:03.425 --> 00:24:06.040
SAM: I don't know, just thought you might like to
know.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:11.539
TRAVIS: Well, you're not that far from her, so she
goes, "It is a baby, it is! Please, we just want

00:24:11.539 --> 00:24:14.166
"to leave, I'm sorry if we caused you any
trouble!"

00:24:14.166 --> 00:24:16.332
LAURA: Does it really look like a baby?

00:24:16.332 --> 00:24:17.705
TRAVIS: Would you want to go over to it?

00:24:17.705 --> 00:24:19.485
LAURA: I want to go over and look at the baby.

00:24:19.485 --> 00:24:23.548
TRAVIS: Yeah, walk on over and make a perception
check. It's a baby.

00:24:23.548 --> 00:24:31.647
LIAM: I'm sorry, I know I keep slowing things down
here, but in this imagination game, can we do

00:24:31.647 --> 00:24:35.168
anything that we do in life?

00:24:35.168 --> 00:24:37.417
TRAVIS: Good question. Yeah!

00:24:37.417 --> 00:24:39.968
LIAM: Can we do things that we can't do in life?

00:24:39.968 --> 00:24:42.718
TRAVIS: You can try.

00:24:42.718 --> 00:24:46.936
LIAM: That sent a shiver down my spine.

00:24:46.936 --> 00:24:51.105
TRAVIS: Pretty much, if you get an idea and you
want to try it, you ask me. We'll roll a dice.

00:24:51.105 --> 00:24:53.478
Then I'll let you know how it goes.

00:24:53.478 --> 00:25:01.487
LIAM: I would like to cast Faerie Fire.

00:25:01.487 --> 00:25:03.615
SAM: You don't do that.

00:25:03.615 --> 00:25:07.751
LIAM: Yes I do. I had the craziest dream last
night, Scanlan.

00:25:07.751 --> 00:25:11.305
SAM: That you became part druid?

00:25:11.305 --> 00:25:16.001
LIAM: Yeah. And then I died, and then I wasn't
here, and then I was. And then there was like,

00:25:16.001 --> 00:25:24.194
three weeks where I was a father in this other
city, washing dishes, and I had this "car." There

00:25:24.194 --> 00:25:28.208
were no horses but it was just wind. I had these
kids. I don't know who these kids were.

00:25:28.208 --> 00:25:30.961
TALIESIN: I feel like we have warned you about
eating cheese before bed.

00:25:30.961 --> 00:25:39.103
TRAVIS: The moldy cheese. The point of this is,
there's a small baby, right, and you've got a

00:25:39.103 --> 00:25:44.627
couple covered in puke, and she's asking if maybe
they can leave instead of-- avoid further scrum.

00:25:44.627 --> 00:25:49.315
LAURA: Well, I fink we should let them leave! I
"fink?" I'm listening to Grog too much!

00:25:49.315 --> 00:25:52.612
LIAM: I'm going to save that for later. I'm going
to put these away.

00:25:52.612 --> 00:26:01.039
TRAVIS: You see his demeanor, like, he totally
goes, like, another eye-poking avoided. Whoosh.

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:09.024
Right? He says, "All right. People make mistakes.
Try to enjoy the rest of your night." He goes over

00:26:09.024 --> 00:26:13.091
and gets his blue-skinned wife up, and she grabs
her little bundle, and they start to make their

00:26:13.091 --> 00:26:14.726
way out of the tavern.

00:26:14.726 --> 00:26:16.202
TALIESIN: I grab the spear.

00:26:16.202 --> 00:26:17.145
TRAVIS: You do?

00:26:17.145 --> 00:26:20.791
TALIESIN: Yes. They didn't take it, so I will take
it now. It's my spear.

00:26:20.791 --> 00:26:27.219
LAURA: That's terrible! They do seem suspicious.
Can I read their lips on the way out? Are they

00:26:27.219 --> 00:26:29.961
talking? Can I read their lips?

00:26:29.961 --> 00:26:31.418
TRAVIS: Sure.

00:26:31.418 --> 00:26:32.734
LAURA: What are they saying?

00:26:32.734 --> 00:26:34.073
TRAVIS: Roll a d20.

00:26:34.073 --> 00:26:36.385
LIAM: Everybody seems to know what's going on.

00:26:36.385 --> 00:26:39.139
LAURA: Am I adding anything to it?

00:26:39.139 --> 00:26:40.734
TRAVIS: Perception. Do a perception check.

00:26:40.734 --> 00:26:42.506
SAM: Just "yes, and," Vax. Yes, and.

00:26:42.506 --> 00:26:48.638
LAURA: 24. That's good.

00:26:48.638 --> 00:26:53.961
TRAVIS: Whoa. So you see that she's actually going
like, "That was so embarrassing. I want to go home

00:26:53.961 --> 00:26:59.298
"and take my clothes off and you and I go and we'll
have a great night."

00:26:59.298 --> 00:27:02.023
LAURA: Okay, I think they really want to go bone.

00:27:02.023 --> 00:27:04.051
TRAVIS: Yeah, lots of boning in their
future.

00:27:04.051 --> 00:27:09.105
TALIESIN: I wish to examine the spear. Is it a
special spear? Is it an interesting spear? Does it

00:27:09.105 --> 00:27:11.026
do anything? Does it require batteries?

00:27:11.026 --> 00:27:17.951
TRAVIS: Batteries? What are batteries? You see the
spear is a long wooden pole wrapped with some

00:27:17.951 --> 00:27:25.129
cloth where you might hold it with your hands. At
the tip is a very rusted metal sharp point at the

00:27:25.129 --> 00:27:32.957
tip. You got yourself a spear. So now, now you
truly have the tavern to yourself. It's just us

00:27:32.957 --> 00:27:40.770
five. Yeah. You see Grog sitting there and he's
aghast at how rude Pike was to puke all over this

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:45.913
couple, and that you would go and poke them in the
eyes. Grog's very dignified. No, that's not true.

00:27:45.913 --> 00:27:52.364
Grog goes over to Pike and goes, "Okay, Pikey-poo,
maybe it's time to, let's put you to sleep

00:27:52.364 --> 00:27:59.327
"upstairs. Barkeep!" And you look behind the
tavern, and there is a-- fuck, in your mind, he's

00:27:59.327 --> 00:28:00.726
fucking over there.

00:28:00.726 --> 00:28:02.688
TALIESIN: It's a muscle reaction, it's
inevitable.

00:28:02.688 --> 00:28:07.765
TRAVIS: He might be over there in a second. Stay
with me. So Grog picks up Pike and goes over to

00:28:07.765 --> 00:28:15.855
the barkeep and he's like, "Do you have any rooms
that I can put this little gnome in?" And he's

00:28:15.855 --> 00:28:20.911
like, "Yes, I have, I do! Have rooms!"

00:28:20.911 --> 00:28:25.058
SAM: Good voice, Grog!

00:28:25.058 --> 00:28:33.377
TRAVIS: (wheezing) "How much money do you have?"
And Grog's like, "I have ten gold." And he's like,

00:28:33.377 --> 00:28:41.572
"Sure, that'll fucking do it!" So Grog goes and
takes Pike upstairs, puts her in a room, comes

00:28:41.572 --> 00:28:44.447
back down. And like, "Whoa, she is hammered."

00:28:44.447 --> 00:28:46.529
LAURA: Ten gold for a room, Grog, is a lot.

00:28:46.529 --> 00:28:50.673
TRAVIS: I don't know if you know, but I'm super
rich because I never really buy anything.

00:28:50.673 --> 00:28:53.569
LAURA: You do buy some things.

00:28:53.569 --> 00:28:59.478
TRAVIS: I always seem to find the money. That's
what I do. Find the money. So now, it turns out

00:28:59.478 --> 00:29:05.266
that your cups are all slightly emptier than
before. Your plates are rather empty. It doesn't

00:29:05.266 --> 00:29:12.721
really seem like we want the night to end. Does
somebody want to maybe check with the barkeep and

00:29:12.721 --> 00:29:14.623
see if he has any more?

00:29:14.623 --> 00:29:18.241
LIAM: Grog-- not Grog, but Grog-- did we get any
points?

00:29:18.241 --> 00:29:19.916
TRAVIS: Points?

00:29:19.916 --> 00:29:22.089
SAM: He does not understand this game.

00:29:22.089 --> 00:29:24.687
TRAVIS: Oh, right. Oh! Like, did we do something
right?

00:29:24.687 --> 00:29:25.916
LIAM: Did we win?

00:29:25.916 --> 00:29:32.997
TRAVIS: No. Actually, like, at the end of this
story, you either win or lose, like, overall.

00:29:32.997 --> 00:29:37.369
LAURA: Oh, are you going to judge us? Does one of
us win more than other people?

00:29:37.369 --> 00:29:38.812
TRAVIS: Potentially.

00:29:38.812 --> 00:29:40.819
TALIESIN: Did you not take any drama classes as a
child?

00:29:40.819 --> 00:29:42.652
LAURA: I'm going to win so good.

00:29:42.652 --> 00:29:43.998
TRAVIS: Don't you like the theater?

00:29:43.998 --> 00:29:48.698
LIAM: I love the theater. But we're playing a
game!

00:29:48.698 --> 00:29:52.718
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, no, it's one big long game.
Preferably three to four hours long.

00:29:52.718 --> 00:29:58.805
LAURA: That's a long game, Grog.

00:29:58.805 --> 00:30:01.909
LIAM: I thought we were near the end of the game,
but we're just getting started?

00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:04.382
TRAVIS: Oh, we're just kicking this shit off. Get
comfy.

00:30:04.382 --> 00:30:10.540
SAM: If we're going to be here for a while, Grog,
can I have some of my invisible servants come in

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:17.935
and lightly play a light accompaniment music? Play
some strings or flutes?

00:30:17.935 --> 00:30:20.417
TRAVIS: Set the tone, the mood? Totally.

00:30:20.417 --> 00:30:24.452
SAM: Oh there it is, it's nice.

00:30:24.452 --> 00:30:31.255
TRAVIS: Hold on, can you ask them to bring in
some, like, meats? Like a meat and cheese plate?

00:30:31.255 --> 00:30:32.698
SAM: I actually can't.

00:30:32.698 --> 00:30:35.653
TRAVIS: Come on, Kaylie won't fucking know,
please! I'm so tired of this green shit!

00:30:35.653 --> 00:30:39.232
SAM: I will know. She'll be able to read it on my
face. She can see all of my lies.

00:30:39.232 --> 00:30:42.626
LIAM: It's a game! It's make-believe!

00:30:42.626 --> 00:30:47.263
SAM: Oh, if it's make-believe, then, here you go!
Here are your meats for you, right there!

00:30:47.263 --> 00:30:51.134
TRAVIS: Nope, you got to stay in the game. That's
only in the game with that stuff. So you're in the

00:30:51.134 --> 00:30:56.056
tavern. You need more to drink. Who wants to go
talk to the barkeep?

00:30:56.056 --> 00:30:57.486
TALIESIN: I'll go talk to the barkeep.

00:30:57.486 --> 00:30:59.033
TRAVIS: What do you do?

00:30:59.033 --> 00:31:02.155
TALIESIN: Another round for everyone. Your
finest.

00:31:02.155 --> 00:31:03.305
TRAVIS: "Eh?"

00:31:03.305 --> 00:31:07.027
TALIESIN: (shouting) Another round for everyone!
Your finest!

00:31:07.027 --> 00:31:11.215
TRAVIS: "Oh yes, yeah, oh! To drink, or to eat?"

00:31:11.215 --> 00:31:16.366
TALIESIN: To drink! Another round of drinks! For
everyone!

00:31:16.366 --> 00:31:17.877
SAM: Ask him his name.

00:31:17.877 --> 00:31:22.850
TALIESIN: Why would I do--? Your finest! What's
your name?

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:24.501
LIAM: We want to get fucked up!

00:31:24.501 --> 00:31:25.765
TALIESIN: Why do I care about his name?

00:31:25.765 --> 00:31:27.434
SAM: Because I want to hear what Grog comes up
with!

00:31:27.434 --> 00:31:28.474
TALIESIN: But his name is Grog!

00:31:28.474 --> 00:31:31.081
TRAVIS: "My name? It's Bob!"

00:31:31.081 --> 00:31:34.741
TALIESIN: All right, I'll admit, that is quite
charming.

00:31:34.741 --> 00:31:38.169
TRAVIS: "Bobaline is my full name, but people call
me Bob!"

00:31:38.169 --> 00:31:42.369
TALIESIN: Bobaline, I feel, really, is quite
appropriate.

00:31:42.369 --> 00:31:49.057
TRAVIS: "It's a family name. If you want more to
drink, unfortunately, I was not planning on you

00:31:49.057 --> 00:31:58.354
"being here. It's quite late. I do, however, have
more food in the pantry below the bar. Or, there

00:31:58.354 --> 00:32:02.945
"are some extra casks of ale out with the pigs."

00:32:02.945 --> 00:32:08.901
TALIESIN: I don't understand how a bar runs out of
alcohol after one round for five of us.

00:32:08.901 --> 00:32:15.121
SAM: It's not run out, he said he has more
downstairs, or there's some outside in the back.

00:32:15.121 --> 00:32:18.029
LAURA: I think we should go down to the cellar.

00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:21.461
LIAM: Bobaline, are you going to go down and get
it and bring it up, or are you--

00:32:21.461 --> 00:32:28.369
TRAVIS: "No, unfortunately, me son is the one
who normally goes and gets it. He's not here."

00:32:28.369 --> 00:32:31.874
TALIESIN: What's your son's name?

00:32:31.874 --> 00:32:33.580
TRAVIS: "Timothy!"

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:38.522
TALIESIN: Bobaline and Timothy. That's excellent.
I should write that down to make sure that you

00:32:38.522 --> 00:32:40.843
don't forget it or screw it up later.

00:32:40.843 --> 00:32:44.739
SAM: Vax, he's presenting us with a choice. 
We, as a group, must make this choice together.

00:32:44.739 --> 00:32:47.267
LIAM: He's sending us to his basement. 
That's creepy!

00:32:47.267 --> 00:32:50.551
TRAVIS: "Well, it's not a huge deal, I just need
one of you to either go down and get the food,

00:32:50.551 --> 00:32:52.818
"and one of you to go get the ale."

00:32:52.818 --> 00:32:56.212
LAURA: You and I will go down to the cellar.

00:32:56.212 --> 00:33:02.445
TRAVIS: "Yeah, you go down to the cellar, and
Grog-- I will go get the ale, unless somebody

00:33:02.445 --> 00:33:05.222
"wants to go out in the pig sty. I'll go."

00:33:05.222 --> 00:33:07.845
LIAM: We will go with you, Grog, to the pig sty.

00:33:07.845 --> 00:33:09.732
TRAVIS: "Or do you two want to go get the ale?"

00:33:09.732 --> 00:33:12.975
SAM: I volunteer to go to the sty.

00:33:12.975 --> 00:33:18.938
TRAVIS: Okay, cool. So you, Vax, and Sam,
you make your way out back. Scanlan!

00:33:18.938 --> 00:33:26.020
LIAM: I'm not going to the basement, because once,
in Syngorn, a comic book shop owner tried to get

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:32.619
me to go to the basement to look at comic books,
and I'm not doing that. Yeah. So good luck in the

00:33:32.619 --> 00:33:35.109
cellar. Let's go see the pigs.

00:33:35.109 --> 00:33:41.600
TRAVIS: As Vax and Scanlan start to head 
toward the back door, Vex and Percy,

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.358
would you like to try and find 
the latch under the bar that leads--

00:33:45.358 --> 00:33:47.379
LAURA: Yes, we would.

00:33:47.379 --> 00:33:56.121
TRAVIS: You find it. Fuck, it's right there.
Good job. Right, so you lift the latch in the

00:33:56.121 --> 00:34:02.538
floor and you go down. It's a very small room that
has different salted meats and cheeses, and some

00:34:02.538 --> 00:34:04.575
bread and stuff like that.

00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:06.139
TALIESIN: This cellar has better food 
than your mansion.

00:34:06.139 --> 00:34:07.948
LAURA: We take it all.

00:34:07.948 --> 00:34:09.676
TRAVIS: You take armfuls?

00:34:09.676 --> 00:34:11.873
LAURA: After a little bit.

00:34:11.873 --> 00:34:15.625
TRAVIS: I mean, do you want to see maybe what else
is down there?

00:34:15.982 --> 00:34:18.198
LAURA: Yeah, let's see what else is down there.

00:34:18.198 --> 00:34:22.369
TRAVIS: Roll perception checks.

00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:26.106
LAURA: Oh, this is good. 28.

00:34:26.106 --> 00:34:27.472
TALIESIN: 23.

00:34:27.472 --> 00:34:33.899
TRAVIS: Nice. You also see three of these bottles
with hided, belted locks on it, and it says

00:34:33.899 --> 00:34:40.912
"sandkheg" on there. It looks really, really
expensive. There's three bottles of that. Yep.

00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:45.697
LAURA: I'm going to try to pick the lock so I can
get them. Can I do that?

00:34:45.697 --> 00:34:48.255
TRAVIS: Sure. What do you roll to pick a lock?

00:34:48.255 --> 00:34:50.965
LIAM: I don't know whether to shit or go blind in
this game.

00:34:50.965 --> 00:34:52.510
LAURA: What do I roll to pick a lock?

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:56.206
SAM: Vax has no idea.

00:34:56.206 --> 00:34:58.338
TRAVIS: What about Liam? What does Liam know?

00:34:58.338 --> 00:35:03.280
LIAM: Intelligence, I'd think.
Yeah, you have to know how locks work.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.636
LAURA: I'd think it's dexterity or something.

00:35:05.636 --> 00:35:07.593
TALIESIN: Dex proficiency, for god's sake.

00:35:07.593 --> 00:35:08.787
TRAVIS: Roll for it.

00:35:08.787 --> 00:35:10.609
LIAM: What are those words you're using?!

00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:13.338
TALIESIN: Were you never in school? 
Have you never done this before?

00:35:13.338 --> 00:35:16.936
LIAM: I didn't pay attention through any of
school. I copied everything that she wrote down.

00:35:16.936 --> 00:35:19.207
TALIESIN: This is everything I did in school. 
I remember this game.

00:35:19.207 --> 00:35:20.210
LAURA: 15.

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:24.834
TRAVIS: Oh, that's not very good. Unfortunately,
this is a better expensive bottle of sandkheg.

00:35:24.834 --> 00:35:32.056
After trying to break the lock, or pick it, you
get the lockpick stuck in there. Yeah, and it's

00:35:32.056 --> 00:35:37.295
all fucked up. But you're really resilient and you
smash the top of the bottle. It seems stupid to

00:35:37.295 --> 00:35:39.398
have a lock on a glass bottle, but it works.

00:35:39.398 --> 00:35:41.065
LAURA: I don't want to smash the bottle.

00:35:41.065 --> 00:35:43.146
TRAVIS: You did it already. It's too bad.

00:35:43.146 --> 00:35:46.256
LAURA: Is all the drink spilling out?

00:35:46.256 --> 00:35:48.786
TRAVIS: No! You just smashed the top off. You have
the rest of the bottle.

00:35:48.786 --> 00:35:51.636
LAURA: Well, okay. That's good.

00:35:51.636 --> 00:35:52.638
TALIESIN: We should try it.

00:35:52.638 --> 00:35:53.502
LAURA: Yeah!

00:35:53.502 --> 00:35:55.635
TRAVIS: You got some salted meats, some cheese.

00:35:55.635 --> 00:36:01.636
LAURA: And this bottle of fanciness. We have to
drink it all because we can't close it back up.

00:36:01.636 --> 00:36:07.347
TRAVIS: You also see some dead rats in the corner,
some empty shelves, and one old leathery book.

00:36:07.347 --> 00:36:09.598
Yeah, it's all dusty shelves.

00:36:09.598 --> 00:36:10.833
TALIESIN: Oh shelves!

00:36:10.833 --> 00:36:12.733
LAURA: Do you see anything else, Percy?

00:36:12.733 --> 00:36:15.569
TRAVIS: There's a leathery book on one of the
shelves.

00:36:15.569 --> 00:36:18.540
TALIESIN: There's a leathery book?! I'm taking the
leathery book, my god.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.546
TRAVIS: Do you want to open it up?

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:24.606
TALIESIN: I want to read the title. 
There should be a title on the cover.

00:36:24.606 --> 00:36:25.683
Books have titles on covers.

00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:27.549
TRAVIS: Yeah, they do. It says "Ledger."

00:36:27.549 --> 00:36:30.011
TALIESIN: It says "Ledger." I'm going to open up
the book.

00:36:30.011 --> 00:36:33.016
LAURA: While he opens it, I'm going to take a sip
of this fancy wine.

00:36:33.016 --> 00:36:35.441
TRAVIS: Great, yeah. Roll a constitution check.

00:36:35.441 --> 00:36:40.166
SAM: You've really caught onto this game quickly.

00:36:40.166 --> 00:36:41.520
LAURA: 13.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:47.052
TRAVIS: 13. Right. You take a sip, and boy does it
burn. You're like (gagging). You feel like you

00:36:47.052 --> 00:36:49.186
could breathe fire. It starts to spread down into
your chest.

00:36:49.186 --> 00:36:51.362
LAURA: Does it make me breathe fire?

00:36:51.362 --> 00:36:55.002
TRAVIS: No, not literal fire, like (gasps) fire.

00:36:55.002 --> 00:36:57.088
TALIESIN: Vex, why are you making a Keyleth face?

00:36:57.088 --> 00:37:01.072
LAURA: This-- what is it called?

00:37:01.072 --> 00:37:01.786
TRAVIS: Sandkheg.

00:37:01.786 --> 00:37:04.303
LAURA: This sandkheg is really strong.

00:37:04.303 --> 00:37:05.786
TALIESIN: Well, I've got to try this really
quickly.

00:37:05.786 --> 00:37:07.568
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus.

00:37:07.568 --> 00:37:10.901
TALIESIN: I take a sip. Sip. Sip.

00:37:10.901 --> 00:37:16.694
LAURA: You have to be very careful because it's
jagged on the top.

00:37:16.694 --> 00:37:18.714
TALIESIN: I know, you have to be very careful
because there's broken glass.

00:37:18.714 --> 00:37:20.412
TRAVIS: Roll a constitution check.

00:37:20.412 --> 00:37:22.650
LIAM: What kind of role playing are we doing
here?

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:25.218
TALIESIN: The best kind. No. I rolled a four.

00:37:25.218 --> 00:37:28.536
TRAVIS: Yeah, so the warmth starts to spread,
right?

00:37:28.536 --> 00:37:29.618
TALIESIN: Oh my.

00:37:29.618 --> 00:37:36.126
TRAVIS: You also feel this immediate desire to
upchuck the liquid because it's so strong. In your

00:37:36.126 --> 00:37:41.371
rush to cover your mouth, you drop the bottle and
it shatters all over the floor.

00:37:41.371 --> 00:37:43.766
SAM: Do we hear it upstairs?

00:37:43.766 --> 00:37:45.867
TALIESIN: We speak of this never again.

00:37:45.867 --> 00:37:47.733
LAURA: Ever. Nobody knows.

00:37:47.733 --> 00:37:49.599
TALIESIN: We should open the book, though.

00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:50.462
LAURA: Yeah, let's open this ledger.

00:37:50.462 --> 00:37:53.993
TRAVIS: You open the book, and it's got numbers in
it with letters.

00:37:53.993 --> 00:37:56.789
TALIESIN: Are they in a particular order?

00:37:56.789 --> 00:37:59.544
TRAVIS: I guess.

00:37:59.544 --> 00:38:12.838
TALIESIN: Using my deftness of wit, can I start to
put together some meaning to the numbers and words

00:38:12.838 --> 00:38:14.814
within this ledger?

00:38:14.814 --> 00:38:18.013
TRAVIS: Unfortunately, no, it's beyond your mental
prowess. So, back upstairs!

00:38:18.013 --> 00:38:19.574
TALIESIN: Goddamn it!

00:38:19.574 --> 00:38:23.599
LAURA: All of the food. We're carrying meat and
cheese and all of that.

00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:25.147
TRAVIS: Y'all want to stay in the pantry or come
back up?

00:38:25.147 --> 00:38:26.594
LAURA: We did for a while.

00:38:26.594 --> 00:38:27.832
TRAVIS: Yeah, you stayed down there for a while?

00:38:27.832 --> 00:38:29.139
TALIESIN: For a while.

00:38:29.139 --> 00:38:29.965
LAURA: And then we came back up.

00:38:29.965 --> 00:38:34.188
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Vax and Scanlan, y'all head
out back.

00:38:34.188 --> 00:38:40.202
LIAM: We're getting ale for our buddy, Grog. Got
to keep the big man hydrated.

00:38:40.202 --> 00:38:47.624
SAM: That's right, we have to. He'll know if we
don't get him some, so let's go sneaky back there

00:38:47.624 --> 00:38:50.476
to make sure there's no monsters hiding.

00:38:50.476 --> 00:38:52.621
LIAM: Do you know how to sneak with dice?

00:38:52.621 --> 00:38:54.382
SAM: Sure!

00:38:54.382 --> 00:38:55.560
LIAM: How do you do it?

00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:02.508
SAM: We tell our Bunion Master that we're going
out there to sneak around and then he'll make it

00:39:02.508 --> 00:39:05.667
happen for us.

00:39:05.667 --> 00:39:08.254
LIAM: Okay. Night at the Improv, here we go.

00:39:08.254 --> 00:39:13.964
TRAVIS: Use your imagination.You get to the back
door and you push it open. You see before you,

00:39:13.964 --> 00:39:23.918
right, a pen full of muck, mud and these three
large hogs rolling around in the muck. Off to the

00:39:23.918 --> 00:39:27.292
side, you see a large cask of ale.

00:39:27.292 --> 00:39:31.677
LIAM: Neither one of us are very strong, can you
do your handy thing?

00:39:31.677 --> 00:39:33.687
SAM: To pick it up?

00:39:33.687 --> 00:39:38.575
LIAM: Yeah, I don't want to get all muddy and
shit, could you just grab it from here?

00:39:38.575 --> 00:39:42.127
SAM: Sure I could, but shouldn't we try to lift it
first?

00:39:42.127 --> 00:39:45.441
LIAM: It seems to plebeian, don't you want to skip
the hard work?

00:39:45.441 --> 00:39:50.138
SAM: Sure, right, this is all make-'em-up. It
doesn't matter, right?

00:39:50.138 --> 00:39:54.494
LIAM: Sure! I can make a purple hand! 
Can I make a purple hand? Why not?

00:39:54.494 --> 00:39:55.357
I thought it was imagination?!

00:39:55.357 --> 00:39:57.138
TRAVIS: No, it's not what you do.

00:39:57.138 --> 00:39:58.178
TALIESIN: You're imagining wrong.

00:39:58.178 --> 00:40:06.121
LIAM: Is my fun wrong?! I guess it is! All right,
well, show me how to handle a pig.

00:40:06.121 --> 00:40:08.925
SAM: I'm picking up a pig?

00:40:08.925 --> 00:40:12.456
LAURA: No, it's a cattle-- I'm not there. 
Yes, I am. I am still technically here.

00:40:12.456 --> 00:40:13.883
TRAVIS: No, actually, you're not there.

00:40:13.883 --> 00:40:15.962
LIAM: I'm so confused!

00:40:15.962 --> 00:40:21.271
TRAVIS: Percy and Vex have made their way back to
the table. You two are--

00:40:21.271 --> 00:40:23.388
LIAM: But we're right at the table!

00:40:23.388 --> 00:40:26.188
TRAVIS: No, the table in the tavern. You two are
at the back hall room there.

00:40:26.188 --> 00:40:27.861
SAM: And we're trying to move a pig?

00:40:27.861 --> 00:40:29.011
LAURA: No, a cask!

00:40:29.011 --> 00:40:30.678
SAM: That's what I thought.

00:40:30.678 --> 00:40:32.515
TALIESIN: Can't tell them, you're not there!

00:40:32.515 --> 00:40:35.878
LIAM: No, I got confused for a second because this
is confusing.

00:40:36.115 --> 00:40:37.764
TRAVIS: It's normally &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; job, but yeah.

00:40:37.764 --> 00:40:41.966
LIAM: Yeah! I'm roleplaying a little bit today.
You're going to grab the booze

00:40:41.966 --> 00:40:44.040
and carry it back with us.

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:49.184
SAM: Yeah! I'd like to cast Bigby's Hand and lift
the cask.

00:40:49.184 --> 00:40:49.816
TALIESIN: Don't forget the pig.

00:40:49.816 --> 00:40:55.758
TRAVIS: Right. It's simple enough. So Bigby's Hand
just appears around the cask and it wraps its

00:40:55.758 --> 00:41:00.068
purple fingers around the cask, picks it up, and
holds it in mid-air.

00:41:00.068 --> 00:41:07.598
SAM: All right. Come with me, O hand that holds
the cask of our dreams.

00:41:07.598 --> 00:41:12.068
TRAVIS: Flavor. That's some good color. You guys
should really step up your fucking game. Leave it

00:41:12.068 --> 00:41:17.618
to the bard, but yeah. Nice job. You get 300 XP for
that performance.

00:41:17.618 --> 00:41:19.071
SAM: I got points!

00:41:19.071 --> 00:41:21.072
LIAM: What did he get?

00:41:21.082 --> 00:41:22.628
TRAVIS: Don't worry about it.

00:41:22.628 --> 00:41:26.292
SAM: Wait, I got 300 points. I'm winning!

00:41:26.292 --> 00:41:31.056
TRAVIS: You remember being in school and they gave
out gold stars when you did good things?

00:41:31.056 --> 00:41:33.670
LIAM: I was daydreaming, but I guess.

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:35.335
LAURA: I'm starting to take notes.

00:41:35.335 --> 00:41:39.381
LIAM: But you said there were no points and you
got points?

00:41:39.381 --> 00:41:41.883
TRAVIS: No, they're not points. They're XP.

00:41:41.883 --> 00:41:44.064
SAM: What does that stand for, Grog?

00:41:44.064 --> 00:41:45.981
TRAVIS: Xylophone Players.

00:41:45.981 --> 00:41:50.075
TALIESIN: 300 Xylophone Players. My god, 
you could retire on that! In fact,

00:41:50.075 --> 00:41:51.326
you could retire quite well on that.

00:41:51.326 --> 00:41:53.898
LIAM: That's a fancy word!

00:41:53.898 --> 00:41:56.720
TRAVIS: So you get the cask and you draw it back
over.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.664
LIAM: It's no mystery that Grog likes you better
than he likes me, so--

00:41:59.664 --> 00:42:02.444
LAURA: Shut up! Let Grog tell a story!

00:42:02.444 --> 00:42:03.936
TRAVIS: Did you bring the cask back to the table?

00:42:03.936 --> 00:42:08.972
SAM: Yes, I float it back in and I present it in
front of the barkeep and say, Bob!

00:42:08.972 --> 00:42:09.834
TRAVIS: "Yes?"

00:42:09.834 --> 00:42:11.795
SAM: Your cask awaits.

00:42:11.795 --> 00:42:18.877
TRAVIS: "You did a really great job. You guys are
good. Good. Please, I'll give 70 percent off,

00:42:18.877 --> 00:42:22.068
"because shit, no one's here, so nobody will
know."

00:42:22.068 --> 00:42:24.972
LAURA: Great! That's wonderful. Thank you, Bob.

00:42:24.972 --> 00:42:33.365
TRAVIS: "So please take, enjoy. It's just you."
So you take the cask and the food back over. You

00:42:33.365 --> 00:42:37.131
two look a little disheveled, like you may have 
fallen down some stairs, going into the pantry.

00:42:37.131 --> 00:42:38.897
TALIESIN: That may have happened.

00:42:38.897 --> 00:42:45.369
TRAVIS: That's fucking gross. Yeah, so you pour
ale all around, you get your cups full again.

00:42:45.369 --> 00:42:48.664
You've got a little more food into your belly, 
and you make one more toast for the night

00:42:48.664 --> 00:42:54.309
to your successes as warriors, victorious. 
Who wants to make a toast?

00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:58.812
SAM: This would be a good opportunity 
for you all to get some XP.

00:42:58.812 --> 00:43:08.195
LAURA: Oh right. I would like to make a toast 
to the greatest fighters, to someone

00:43:08.195 --> 00:43:14.167
who used his smart hand to carry a cask of ale. 
This sucks. I'm really shitty.

00:43:14.167 --> 00:43:16.136
TRAVIS: No, that's good.

00:43:16.136 --> 00:43:17.952
TALIESIN and LAURA: And to Grog!

00:43:17.952 --> 00:43:21.833
LAURA: Who's so strong and brave and very smart.

00:43:21.833 --> 00:43:24.619
TALIESIN: Extremely intelligent.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.671
LAURA: And to all of this meat that we get to
eat!

00:43:27.671 --> 00:43:29.094
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:43:29.094 --> 00:43:30.851
LAURA, TALIESIN, and TRAVIS: Cheers!

00:43:30.851 --> 00:43:33.924
TRAVIS: Everybody drink to that.

00:43:33.924 --> 00:43:38.939
LAURA: What did you actually call it,
the purple hand? What'd you call that?

00:43:38.939 --> 00:43:41.516
SAM: I call it Bigby's Hand!

00:43:41.516 --> 00:43:43.623
LAURA: This is not in character. 
I'm asking you.

00:43:43.623 --> 00:43:46.409
SAM: Oh. I call it Bigby's Hand because a man
named Bigby invented it.

00:43:46.409 --> 00:43:49.597
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's supposed to be us. It's a
concept.

00:43:49.597 --> 00:43:52.241
SAM: I don't know anything about this Bigby.

00:43:52.241 --> 00:43:56.054
TALIESIN: I was assuming it was actually his hand
you were manifesting, like he was a large purple--

00:43:56.054 --> 00:43:59.356
SAM: I learned it from another bard a long time
ago.

00:43:59.356 --> 00:44:00.983
LIAM: What did he play?

00:44:00.983 --> 00:44:02.132
TALIESIN: Was his name Bigby?

00:44:02.132 --> 00:44:07.847
SAM: It was a he. He was actually a stand-up
comedian. That was his thing.

00:44:07.847 --> 00:44:10.215
TALIESIN: Oh, so it was an applause hand?

00:44:10.215 --> 00:44:11.442
SAM: Yeah.

00:44:11.442 --> 00:44:18.455
TRAVIS: As the alcohol starts to go down the
throats into the belly, down into your belly,

00:44:18.455 --> 00:44:21.565
the world starts to get a little hazy.

00:44:21.565 --> 00:44:23.338
SAM: Oh no. Did we just drink poison?

00:44:23.338 --> 00:44:26.734
LAURA: Oh no! Did this stupid Bobaline poison us?

00:44:26.972 --> 00:44:32.381
TRAVIS: You got a 150 XP for saying it. Also, you
feel a lot of warmth in your face and you feel

00:44:32.381 --> 00:44:38.689
almost as if the world's been tilted on you. Like
someone's pushing you around and you don't have

00:44:38.689 --> 00:44:45.305
much control. You reach out to steady yourself and
to warn your other friends, when all of a sudden,

00:44:45.305 --> 00:44:50.369
the lights go out and you feel gravity take over
and you just fall.

00:44:50.369 --> 00:44:52.037
TALIESIN: Timothy, is that you?

00:44:52.037 --> 00:44:59.543
TRAVIS: And fall, and fall. The end.

00:44:59.543 --> 00:45:00.743
SAM: Wait, that's it?

00:45:00.743 --> 00:45:02.495
TRAVIS: No, that's not the end!

00:45:02.923 --> 00:45:04.675
SAM: But we were just having fun!

00:45:04.675 --> 00:45:10.180
TRAVIS: (shouting) You come to! (normal voice)
Sorry, Chris. You come to and you're lying on the

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.533
floor. It's cold.

00:45:12.533 --> 00:45:13.935
LAURA: Do we feel drunk?

00:45:13.935 --> 00:45:15.673
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:45:15.673 --> 00:45:17.255
LIAM: Do we feel hungover?

00:45:17.255 --> 00:45:23.006
TRAVIS: Nope. It's cold. It feels like stone
underneath you. It's moist and damp. There's dirt

00:45:23.006 --> 00:45:28.359
everywhere and it feels uneven. You open your eyes
and the light of the tavern is not the same as it

00:45:28.359 --> 00:45:34.114
was before. In fact, you're on a wood floor and
you remember, but now there's stones beneath you.

00:45:34.114 --> 00:45:35.611
LIAM: Do we have all our shit?

00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:42.193
TRAVIS: You got all your stuff. You look and you
seem to be in some sort of dimly-lit cavern. You

00:45:42.193 --> 00:45:47.881
all look around and you see your mates around you.
All there, but the environment has changed.

00:45:47.881 --> 00:45:49.772
LAURA: Is there any light?

00:45:49.772 --> 00:45:56.663
TRAVIS: There is light. You look around and there
seem to be along these stone walls around you,

00:45:56.663 --> 00:45:59.712
random torches. So there is some torchlight down
here.

00:45:59.712 --> 00:46:01.997
SAM: He really paints a vivid picture.

00:46:01.997 --> 00:46:04.022
LAURA: Can I stand up?

00:46:04.022 --> 00:46:04.868
TRAVIS: You can.

00:46:04.868 --> 00:46:06.557
LAURA: Can I go grab a torch?

00:46:06.557 --> 00:46:10.983
TRAVIS: Would you like to? They're a bit high, 
unfortunately. They're about eight to ten feet

00:46:10.983 --> 00:46:13.989
off the floor. It's just out of your reach.

00:46:13.989 --> 00:46:16.088
LAURA: Can I use my broom to fly up and grab it?

00:46:16.088 --> 00:46:17.544
TRAVIS: You can, if you want to.

00:46:17.544 --> 00:46:18.872
LAURA: Yeah, I'll grab it.

00:46:18.872 --> 00:46:24.490
TRAVIS: All right. So you hop onto your broom,
kick up off the ground and grab the torch. You

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:30.271
pull it out and off in the distance somewhere, 
you hear a scraping sound. Very faint,

00:46:30.271 --> 00:46:32.447
but you hear it.

00:46:32.447 --> 00:46:37.051
TALIESIN: What strange intelligence would have
gone through this hall and lit torches that were

00:46:37.051 --> 00:46:40.965
eight to ten feet off the ground? That's very
particular.

00:46:40.965 --> 00:46:44.737
SAM: You have that special sense! Try to sense if
there's any flagons around?

00:46:44.737 --> 00:46:50.666
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to try to sense if there's
any flagons. Big ones, with wings.

00:46:50.666 --> 00:46:52.797
TRAVIS: Roll a perception check.

00:46:52.797 --> 00:46:55.275
LAURA: No, it's not a perception check, 
it's just my--

00:46:55.275 --> 00:46:56.849
TALIESIN: Flagon sense?

00:46:56.849 --> 00:46:58.369
LAURA: It's my flagon sense.

00:46:58.369 --> 00:47:00.412
TRAVIS: Is it? Yeah. Yeah, go for it.

00:47:00.412 --> 00:47:02.073
LAURA: Are there any flagons around?

00:47:02.073 --> 00:47:04.445
TRAVIS: Yeah, no fucking flagons around.

00:47:04.445 --> 00:47:06.106
LAURA: I'm going to mark off a spell.

00:47:06.106 --> 00:47:09.302
LIAM: What are all these papers?

00:47:09.302 --> 00:47:13.963
TRAVIS: Currently, Vex is the only one who's
gotten to her feet and grabbed a torch. Are you

00:47:13.963 --> 00:47:15.872
all standing up, looking around?

00:47:15.872 --> 00:47:18.323
LAURA: Just be quiet. I'm going to cast Pass
Without a Trace on all of us.

00:47:18.323 --> 00:47:20.002
So that we're quiet.

00:47:20.002 --> 00:47:21.260
LIAM: Can I hide?

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.466
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:47:22.466 --> 00:47:25.373
LIAM: I can? I'm going to hide. 
Do your thingy, though.

00:47:25.373 --> 00:47:28.177
TRAVIS: Yeah. Everybody please roll a stealth
check.

00:47:28.177 --> 00:47:29.669
LIAM: You don't have to clap or--

00:47:29.669 --> 00:47:33.298
LAURA: I've already cast it. I cast it already,
but roll a stealth check.

00:47:33.298 --> 00:47:36.128
SAM: 18, Grog!

00:47:36.128 --> 00:47:37.767
TRAVIS: 18. Good.

00:47:37.767 --> 00:47:38.606
LAURA: Add ten to it!

00:47:38.606 --> 00:47:39.900
SAM: I did already.

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:41.158
TALIESIN: 19.

00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:44.171
LAURA: I don't know what that means, but I don't
know why would you do that.

00:47:44.171 --> 00:47:45.521
TALIESIN: Why not add ten?

00:47:45.521 --> 00:47:47.864
SAM: Oh, we got something!
Something's happening!

00:47:48.046 --> 00:47:50.053
TALIESIN: Have you been at the arts and crafts?

00:47:50.053 --> 00:47:52.845
TRAVIS: Okay, now listen. This is where the fun
starts.

00:47:52.845 --> 00:47:54.473
LIAM: What are these things?

00:47:54.473 --> 00:47:58.078
TALIESIN: Let's not look. He's setting something
up. I'm not going to look. Close your eyes.

00:47:58.078 --> 00:48:01.993
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest. It's a fantastic game.

00:48:01.993 --> 00:48:03.986
LAURA: Do you need help?

00:48:03.986 --> 00:48:05.254
TRAVIS: No.

00:48:05.254 --> 00:48:07.830
SAM: It looks like two boobs.

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:10.167
LAURA: It looks like a butt with a staple in it.

00:48:10.167 --> 00:48:17.926
LIAM: You've seen that before. Oh, I'm right at
the crack! Of course. That guy looks just like

00:48:17.926 --> 00:48:22.149
you, Grog! He looks like me! That looks like
Scanlan!

00:48:22.149 --> 00:48:23.469
TALIESIN: That looks nothing like me.

00:48:23.469 --> 00:48:24.858
LIAM: That doesn't look like you at all.

00:48:24.858 --> 00:48:26.355
TALIESIN: It's totally off.

00:48:26.355 --> 00:48:28.640
LAURA: Where's Trinket?

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:34.324
(gasps) Grog! Trinket's here! 
Trinket's popping out of my necklace!

00:48:34.324 --> 00:48:36.175
TRAVIS: There you go.

00:48:36.175 --> 00:48:38.858
LIAM: What, you got a fucking bear?

00:48:38.858 --> 00:48:40.802
TRAVIS: Look at that. You're all there.

00:48:40.802 --> 00:48:42.071
LIAM: Where did you get these toys?

00:48:42.071 --> 00:48:47.483
TRAVIS: I stole it from a small child. So as you
look around your environment, you notice the floor

00:48:47.483 --> 00:48:53.634
is stone, the walls are stone and you seem to be
in some sort of circular cavern. There's also a

00:48:53.634 --> 00:49:01.651
domed ceiling above you. There is just pure wall
for most of this circular room except for an area

00:49:01.651 --> 00:49:05.085
that seems to lead into another chamber beyond.

00:49:05.085 --> 00:49:11.850
LAURA: Oh, I have an idea! Can I shoot one of my
oracle arrows and see what's in the other room?

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:14.686
TRAVIS: You may. Roll an attack.

00:49:14.686 --> 00:49:16.977
LIAM: Also, I rolled a 39 for stealth.

00:49:16.977 --> 00:49:18.595
LAURA: I rolled a 45.

00:49:18.595 --> 00:49:22.112
LIAM: Is that good? Is 39 better or worse than
45?

00:49:22.112 --> 00:49:26.929
TRAVIS: It's so good, in fact, that you take one
step into the wall and you turn and face it like

00:49:26.929 --> 00:49:29.574
the creepy person from Blair Witch, and you stay
there.

00:49:29.574 --> 00:49:33.195
LAURA: 32.

00:49:33.195 --> 00:49:39.602
TRAVIS: 32. Great. So you turn so that you can see
into the other cavern and you shoot your oracle

00:49:39.602 --> 00:49:47.744
arrow. And your sight goes (zooming) and you see
it fly approximately (counting) 25 feet and it

00:49:47.744 --> 00:49:53.779
just hits another wall made of stone in the
cavern, very similar to the one you're in.

00:49:53.779 --> 00:49:55.448
LAURA: It looks the exact same?

00:49:55.448 --> 00:49:57.431
TRAVIS: Yeah, almost identical to this one.

00:49:57.431 --> 00:49:59.285
LIAM: Jeez, Grog, you're inspired today.

00:49:59.285 --> 00:50:00.940
TALIESIN: This is very impressive.

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:07.929
SAM: Come on, even in this imaginary game, we're
invincible heroes of justice. Let's just go look!

00:50:07.929 --> 00:50:09.907
LAURA: Can we see forward? Can we see?

00:50:09.907 --> 00:50:12.626
LIAM: Well, hold on. We know that I like to stick
my dick into things, so why don't I creep ahead

00:50:12.626 --> 00:50:15.657
and see what is happening?

00:50:15.657 --> 00:50:17.725
TRAVIS: Very smart. Make a perception check.

00:50:17.725 --> 00:50:23.261
LAURA: Watch for traps! You don't want to explode,
I don't know what Grog has set up for us.

00:50:23.261 --> 00:50:28.244
LIAM: I'll roll this one with the book on it
because I feel goodness from it. I got a 19 on

00:50:28.244 --> 00:50:34.545
that, plus perception. Oh my gosh, that's really
good. 33 for perception.

00:50:34.545 --> 00:50:39.754
TRAVIS: You open your eyes, and because you're
staring at the wall like a nerd, you notice the

00:50:39.754 --> 00:50:43.985
mortar is very fine. Would anybody like to make a
perception check besides Vax?

00:50:43.985 --> 00:50:46.186
LAURA: I would like to look around the whole
room.

00:50:46.186 --> 00:50:49.087
TRAVIS: Vex, please roll a perception check.

00:50:49.087 --> 00:50:51.734
LIAM: I didn't understand the rules!

00:50:51.734 --> 00:50:53.722
TALIESIN: 17 for me.

00:50:53.722 --> 00:50:55.312
TRAVIS: Oh, very nice, Percival.

00:50:55.312 --> 00:50:56.485
LAURA: 34 for me.

00:50:56.485 --> 00:50:59.647
TRAVIS: 34, that is a high perception. You should
be a rogue.

00:50:59.647 --> 00:51:03.440
LIAM: It's not as high as mine, I would like to
point out, but I was facing the wall.

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:10.889
TRAVIS: So you see that the room extends out to an
edge and you move to the middle and you see that

00:51:10.889 --> 00:51:16.571
these two rooms seem to be identical. There are
torches lighting your way, and above you on this

00:51:16.571 --> 00:51:24.886
rounded ceiling, there are two hatches. Iron
hatches. And above them you see maybe a chute.

00:51:24.886 --> 00:51:29.485
And you wonder, as you see water dripping 
from the hatches in the ceiling,

00:51:29.485 --> 00:51:33.066
if that might have been how you got in this room.

00:51:33.066 --> 00:51:35.398
LAURA: Can I use my broom to fly up and check out
that hatch?

00:51:35.398 --> 00:51:40.542
TRAVIS: You may. So you fly up and you get to the
hatch, and it's solid iron, with rusted-- There's

00:51:40.542 --> 00:51:42.760
water dripping out of it. And you see there is a
chute indeed. No light coming from it.

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:44.349
LAURA: It's bars?

00:51:44.349 --> 00:51:47.872
TRAVIS: Bars, but it looks as if it goes straight
up, and up, and up.

00:51:47.872 --> 00:51:48.911
LAURA: Is it closed off?

00:51:48.911 --> 00:51:51.349
TRAVIS: It is. It's closed very securely.

00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:53.085
LAURA: Can I try to pull them?

00:51:53.085 --> 00:51:55.622
LIAM: May I turn around from the wall first?

00:51:55.622 --> 00:51:57.761
TRAVIS: You may, yes. There you go.

00:51:57.761 --> 00:52:05.630
LIAM: Can I use some sort of perception or
insight or one of these numbers to figure out if

00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:07.802
we are in a room shaped like a cock and balls?

00:52:07.802 --> 00:52:11.713
TRAVIS: You may. Roll a perception check.

00:52:11.713 --> 00:52:16.071
LIAM: Okay. I've got a total of 23, Grog.

00:52:16.071 --> 00:52:24.266
TRAVIS: You move forward, and as you approach Vex,
you do see there is an additional hallway

00:52:24.266 --> 00:52:34.686
that extends forward. Not in the shape
of a cock and balls per se, but there is another

00:52:34.686 --> 00:52:39.209
hallway in front of you, and it extends forward
into darkness, but you do see a very faint torch

00:52:39.209 --> 00:52:41.522
at the end of it all.

00:52:41.522 --> 00:52:42.927
SAM: A tip.

00:52:42.927 --> 00:52:44.848
TRAVIS: Tip of the hallway, yeah.

00:52:44.848 --> 00:52:49.891
LIAM: I'm a big fan of the show Stillben Vandal,
it's quite good.

00:52:49.891 --> 00:52:56.592
TRAVIS: So you are going up. Ooh, this is you!

00:52:56.592 --> 00:52:59.376
LAURA: Can I pull on the bars to see if I can get
out?

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:04.166
TRAVIS: Yeah, you pull on it, and, man, that shit
is-- Roll a strength check. I'll give you a shot.

00:53:04.166 --> 00:53:10.348
LAURA: Because I'm really strong, Grog. Nine.

00:53:10.348 --> 00:53:15.906
TRAVIS: No, no. It doesn't even move. It doesn't
even do the pothole thing. As soon as you step

00:53:15.906 --> 00:53:19.584
on it, it goes boop boop, I'm going to fall. 
But no, it's solid.

00:53:19.584 --> 00:53:22.039
LAURA: Is there a lock to be seen?

00:53:22.039 --> 00:53:27.108
TRAVIS: Not that you can tell. If you want to
check and see if there's a latch to it.

00:53:27.108 --> 00:53:28.352
LAURA: I want to look and see.

00:53:28.352 --> 00:53:30.032
TRAVIS: Roll an investigation check.

00:53:30.032 --> 00:53:37.674
LAURA: Ooh, Grog, what a big word! What is that,
23? 23.

00:53:37.674 --> 00:53:43.144
TRAVIS: 23. You reach through one of the slots in
the plate that's holding--

00:53:43.144 --> 00:53:44.220
LAURA: Did you burp?

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.217
LIAM: I did burp.

00:53:45.217 --> 00:53:46.379
LAURA: Really stinky burp.

00:53:46.379 --> 00:53:48.098
LIAM: I love you too, Stubby.

00:53:48.098 --> 00:53:50.709
TRAVIS: You put your hand through, and as your
fingers curl around, you do feel a very large

00:53:50.709 --> 00:53:58.203
latch, but it is thick and very secure, and it
extends into the mass around it, the wall itself.

00:53:58.203 --> 00:54:03.381
You get the impression that it would take quite a
mechanism to unleash this thing.

00:54:03.381 --> 00:54:06.183
LAURA: Okay. All right.

00:54:06.183 --> 00:54:11.945
SAM: Well, let's go explore. I'm going to walk
around the room. I'm going to walk up the shaft.

00:54:11.945 --> 00:54:14.270
TRAVIS: You both head down the hallway?

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:15.924
LAURA: I'm going to follow them down the shaft.

00:54:15.924 --> 00:54:17.385
SAM: Maybe you left, me right?

00:54:17.385 --> 00:54:19.476
TRAVIS: What's the marching order here?

00:54:19.476 --> 00:54:23.107
SAM: I'll be to the right of the shaft. He's pants
left.

00:54:23.107 --> 00:54:26.283
LIAM: But slowly move up the shaft.

00:54:26.283 --> 00:54:28.290
SAM: You don't want to go too fast down the
shaft.

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:33.093
TRAVIS: You said to the right of the hallway?
And you're going to be on the left? To the left?

00:54:33.265 --> 00:54:34.654
SAM: No, no, he's all the way on the left wall.

00:54:34.654 --> 00:54:36.884
TRAVIS: Vax?

00:54:36.884 --> 00:54:39.338
LIAM: I will follow behind Scan-Man.

00:54:39.338 --> 00:54:41.641
TRAVIS: Okay. And Vex?

00:54:41.641 --> 00:54:47.484
LAURA: Behind Percy. And Trinket's going to stand
next to you, Grog, because he loves you so much.

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:51.086
SAM: Just going to really just snug the edges of
the shaft.

00:54:51.086 --> 00:54:53.069
LIAM: Yeah, you know, palm the sides as you go.

00:54:53.069 --> 00:54:54.628
LAURA: Just move forward, nice and easy.

00:54:54.628 --> 00:54:56.491
TRAVIS: Would you like to proceed down the
hallway?

00:54:56.491 --> 00:54:57.646
SAM: Yes.

00:54:57.646 --> 00:54:59.702
TRAVIS: Okay, so you move forward?

00:54:59.702 --> 00:55:01.377
SAM: We do move forward.

00:55:01.377 --> 00:55:03.315
TALIESIN: Gently, checking for traps.

00:55:03.315 --> 00:55:05.747
SAM: I did not say that.

00:55:05.747 --> 00:55:11.265
TRAVIS: Well, as Scanlan is just ahead of you in
your pursuit down the hallway, Scanlan feels his

00:55:11.265 --> 00:55:14.251
foot fall on a piece of the floor and it sinks.

00:55:14.251 --> 00:55:15.294
LAURA: Oh no.

00:55:15.294 --> 00:55:21.147
TRAVIS: You hear a grinding noise that you've
heard before in our adventures, and it's not good.

00:55:21.147 --> 00:55:25.009
And instinctually, you look to your right
immediately on the wall, and you notice there are

00:55:25.009 --> 00:55:26.410
all these holes in the wall.

00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:27.684
LAURA: Oh no!

00:55:27.684 --> 00:55:32.258
TRAVIS: And sure enough, just as you're looking, a
fucking dart sinks right into your cheek. Just

00:55:32.258 --> 00:55:34.344
poof, right into your-- (yelling)!

00:55:34.344 --> 00:55:39.726
SAM: (screaming) My cheek, it burns, it burns!

00:55:39.726 --> 00:55:42.632
TRAVIS: And just as your hands go up to your face,
another one hits you in the thigh.

00:55:42.632 --> 00:55:45.773
LAURA: Back up! Scanlan! Back up!

00:55:45.773 --> 00:55:47.787
TRAVIS: As you turn around, one sinks into your
butt cheek.

00:55:47.787 --> 00:55:49.858
LIAM: I pull him back!

00:55:49.858 --> 00:55:52.903
TRAVIS: Yeah, you pull him back. You take--

00:55:52.903 --> 00:55:55.379
LIAM: What if I suck the poison out?

00:55:55.379 --> 00:55:57.494
SAM: We don't know if it's poisoned yet.

00:55:57.494 --> 00:56:01.058
LIAM: Well, just on principle. Just on principle.

00:56:01.058 --> 00:56:05.661
TRAVIS: You take 13 points of fucking dart
damage.

00:56:05.661 --> 00:56:09.182
LIAM: Is that a lot? Is that all you have?

00:56:09.182 --> 00:56:11.778
SAM: I assume not. I assume I'm okay.

00:56:11.778 --> 00:56:17.114
TRAVIS: You look at the wound in his cheek, and
the wound in his arm, chest area, they don't seem

00:56:17.114 --> 00:56:24.042
so bad, but the one in his butt is starting to
swell a little bit. Kind of bruised and red.

00:56:24.042 --> 00:56:25.505
LAURA: Yeah, you should definitely suck the poison
out.

00:56:25.505 --> 00:56:28.552
LIAM: I definitely should. Or I could use my
paladin ability--

00:56:28.552 --> 00:56:34.382
LAURA: No, you should just suck it out.

00:56:34.382 --> 00:56:37.063
SAM: I pull down my pants.

00:56:37.063 --> 00:56:41.637
TRAVIS: Make a medicine check as you suck on
Scanlan's ass.

00:56:41.672 --> 00:56:44.021
LIAM: Okay, I'm feeling lucky, though.

00:56:44.021 --> 00:56:46.967
LAURA: Oh no!

00:56:46.967 --> 00:56:50.616
LIAM: But it knocked the first die into a higher
number, can I go with that?

00:56:50.616 --> 00:56:52.079
TALIESIN: That's not how the game works, no.

00:56:52.079 --> 00:56:53.954
LIAM: We've never played this game before!

00:56:53.954 --> 00:57:01.184
TRAVIS: I will make a ruling. Because you are
sucking on Scanlan's ass, you may roll with

00:57:01.184 --> 00:57:02.136
advantage.

00:57:02.136 --> 00:57:08.490
LIAM: Not for the first time. So go again. Look at
what I got! That's a good ass suck right there.

00:57:08.490 --> 00:57:11.391
SAM: I'll be the judge of that.

00:57:11.391 --> 00:57:13.532
LIAM: 19, how did I do?

00:57:13.532 --> 00:57:18.079
TRAVIS: Fantastic. You manage to get the right
amount of pressure right on the butt cheek, right?

00:57:18.079 --> 00:57:22.398
And you suck all the poison out, and you spit it
out, because you know, if you swallow it, also bad

00:57:22.398 --> 00:57:28.274
for you, and you manage to take your head away
just in time as a Scanlan little boop farts out.

00:57:28.274 --> 00:57:33.993
LIAM: I wave it away and then I take the
opportunity to do one of these. (blows raspberry)

00:57:33.993 --> 00:57:41.567
TRAVIS: Oh man. Yeah, nothing like mom's kisses.
That's nice. Good job. So, you've taken 13 points

00:57:41.567 --> 00:57:44.197
of damage, you've pointed it out, I assume, to the
rest of the group.

00:57:44.197 --> 00:57:47.752
SAM: There's lots of holes with darts in them,
what, what?

00:57:47.752 --> 00:57:54.744
(laughter)

00:57:54.744 --> 00:57:55.528
TALIESIN: Oh no.

00:57:55.528 --> 00:57:58.597
TRAVIS: Yeah, in this game, if you notice
something, call it out to each other. Because what

00:57:58.597 --> 00:58:04.206
one person sees, the other somehow might not see.
And just because you know it at the table, doesn't

00:58:04.206 --> 00:58:06.762
mean that you know it in your mind pictures.

00:58:06.762 --> 00:58:08.774
LIAM: You just made that up.

00:58:08.774 --> 00:58:09.911
TRAVIS: That's how this goes, I promise.

00:58:09.911 --> 00:58:11.368
LIAM: Where did you learn this game?

00:58:11.368 --> 00:58:15.450
TRAVIS: I was in a tavern, and this long-haired
guy was playing a game at the table, and I thought

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:19.816
it was fucking great. And I watched for a while.
Like, hours. I was hooked.

00:58:19.816 --> 00:58:23.016
I might go back next week and watch.

00:58:23.016 --> 00:58:26.440
SAM: Do you need any kind of subscription to watch
it, or can you--

00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:29.120
TRAVIS: I'm not sure, actually. That's a great
question.

00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:32.566
LAURA: So, wait. So you saw darts coming out of
the wall, then?

00:58:32.566 --> 00:58:35.692
SAM: Yeah, there's traps. There's lots of traps
down the shaft.

00:58:35.692 --> 00:58:38.053
LAURA: Okay, so, you guys, I'll let you go ahead.

00:58:38.053 --> 00:58:39.751
TALIESIN: I'm going to carefully examine the
floor.

00:58:39.751 --> 00:58:41.529
TRAVIS: So you notice that right here--

00:58:41.529 --> 00:58:42.787
SAM: That is a permanent marker.

00:58:42.787 --> 00:58:45.668
TRAVIS: It is, I don't give a shit. There is this
area.

00:58:45.668 --> 00:58:49.303
SAM: Is that yours?

00:58:49.303 --> 00:58:52.869
TALIESIN: Matt's going to get his-- That mat is
permanently scarred.

00:58:52.869 --> 00:59:01.014
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't fucking care. Or you have to
build a map with that integrated into it. You

00:59:01.014 --> 00:59:04.181
notice that that area of the floor, you step on
it, bad shit happens.

00:59:04.181 --> 00:59:06.938
LIAM: Every map has a dick in it, from here to
eternity.

00:59:06.938 --> 00:59:11.155
LAURA: So we don't step on that section.

00:59:11.155 --> 00:59:14.709
TRAVIS: Well, you haven't gone past it yet. Would
you like to try and cross that area?

00:59:14.709 --> 00:59:17.147
LIAM: I will start looking for traps up this
shaft.

00:59:17.147 --> 00:59:23.284
TRAVIS: Nice. Be very careful with the shaft.
Okay. If you would like to try and cross over that

00:59:23.284 --> 00:59:27.901
area, you all need to make an acrobatic check as
you try and leap over.

00:59:27.901 --> 00:59:29.175
LIAM: Jump over that spot.

00:59:29.175 --> 00:59:32.183
LAURA: Jump over it! Whoa. 33, Grog.

00:59:32.183 --> 00:59:35.142
TRAVIS: That's good.

00:59:35.142 --> 00:59:36.089
TALIESIN: 22.

00:59:36.089 --> 00:59:37.278
SAM: 17.

00:59:37.278 --> 00:59:38.354
TRAVIS: 17.

00:59:38.354 --> 00:59:41.889
LIAM: Ooh yes. 36.

00:59:41.889 --> 00:59:50.726
TRAVIS: 36. Everyone but Vax manages to leap over,
successfully over, well done. Vax catches his

00:59:50.726 --> 00:59:58.201
foot, he's like, (yells) and he falls flat on his
face. And the darts go pew pew pew! Vex, if you

00:59:58.201 --> 01:00:03.164
want to turn, you can try and drag your brother,
who has luckily had all the darts go above his

01:00:03.164 --> 01:00:06.608
lying, goofy body on the floor, and try to pull
him off the plate.

01:00:06.608 --> 01:00:08.553
LAURA: Yes, I would love to try and pull my
brother to safety.

01:00:08.553 --> 01:00:12.126
LIAM: I like to evade stuff like this, can I use
some sort of evasion?

01:00:12.126 --> 01:00:14.320
TRAVIS: Unfortunately, no. Strength check?

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.584
LIAM: I knew this was what this game would be. I
knew it.

01:00:16.584 --> 01:00:23.162
LAURA: Yeah, a strength check? Oh gosh. I'm not
very strong, Grog. Ooh! 22!

01:00:23.162 --> 01:00:26.521
TRAVIS: That's enough, because Vax doesn't have
very many muscles. So you pull him off the plate,

01:00:26.521 --> 01:00:30.506
and he's there, all of you are right there, ready
to go again.

01:00:30.506 --> 01:00:35.015
LAURA: What about Trinket? And Grog?

01:00:35.015 --> 01:00:43.370
TRAVIS: All right. Yeah, hold on. Look, Grog makes
it over, and then Trinket comes up. Roll a

01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:45.019
acrobatics check for Trinket.

01:00:45.019 --> 01:00:52.395
LIAM: Grog, I didn't see anything hit you, but I
might better just suck poison out of your ass,

01:00:52.395 --> 01:00:53.533
just to be sure.

01:00:53.533 --> 01:00:54.591
TRAVIS: You know what, save it for later.

01:00:54.591 --> 01:00:58.639
LAURA: I'm going to say that's a 14 for Trinket.

01:00:58.639 --> 01:01:00.886
TRAVIS: Ooh, yeah, so unfortunately--

01:01:00.886 --> 01:01:02.873
LAURA: Grog, save him as he falls!

01:01:04.023 --> 01:01:08.168
TRAVIS: Sure. So he falls and I start to hear the
grinding again and I pull him by his ear, and

01:01:08.168 --> 01:01:13.654
whoop, everybody's on the safe side of the trap.

01:01:13.654 --> 01:01:15.429
What would you like to do next?

01:01:15.627 --> 01:01:18.441
LIAM: I would like to see if there are any more
traps before we get to the tip.

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:20.274
TRAVIS: Roll a perception check.

01:01:20.274 --> 01:01:25.608
LIAM: Perception, which one is this? There's a
picture of a monk on this one.

01:01:25.608 --> 01:01:30.255
LIAM: Dungeons and Flagons! Perception? 22.

01:01:30.255 --> 01:01:37.595
TRAVIS: 22? Yes, indeed. There are no further
traps towards the tip, but your keen half-elf ears

01:01:37.595 --> 01:01:43.555
pick up a (wind blowing) sound.

01:01:43.555 --> 01:01:45.514
LAURA: Does it sound like ghosts that we have
encountered?

01:01:45.514 --> 01:01:55.069
TRAVIS: "Turn back." And you spin on your heel,
and outside of Grog's amazing deltoids, which

01:01:55.069 --> 01:02:02.722
look swollen from shoulder day, you see behind
you a spectral form starting to make its way

01:02:02.722 --> 01:02:03.586
towards you.

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:05.096
LAURA: Oh no.

01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:08.233
SAM: It's a ghost of some sort, holding a shovel.

01:02:08.233 --> 01:02:12.739
TRAVIS: I need you all to roll initiative.

01:02:12.739 --> 01:02:13.862
LIAM: What?

01:02:13.862 --> 01:02:14.678
TALIESIN: Initiative.

01:02:15.037 --> 01:02:16.772
LIAM: What's initiative?

01:02:16.772 --> 01:02:17.780
TALIESIN: What we're rolling.

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:19.736
LIAM: That's a die, you're rolling a die.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:21.580
TALIESIN: Yes. You roll your initiative die.

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:24.596
LIAM: I had so many ghosts in that box over there,
Travis.

01:02:24.596 --> 01:02:26.051
TRAVIS: I already bought that one.

01:02:26.051 --> 01:02:33.608
LIAM: I brought six tubs of miniatures. So many
miniatures.

01:02:33.608 --> 01:02:35.489
SAM: You bought that ghost with a shovel already?

01:02:35.489 --> 01:02:39.141
TRAVIS: Yeah. It was two dollars or
something.

01:02:39.141 --> 01:02:42.549
SAM: Why is he holding a shovel?

01:02:42.549 --> 01:02:43.506
LAURA: 24.

01:02:43.506 --> 01:02:46.429
LIAM: 16.

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:49.108
TRAVIS: 16. Percy.

01:02:49.108 --> 01:02:50.137
TALIESIN: 16.

01:02:50.137 --> 01:02:52.524
TRAVIS: Wow. 16, Percy. Really?

01:02:52.524 --> 01:02:54.638
TALIESIN: 16. I rolled very poorly.

01:02:54.638 --> 01:02:56.103
SAM: 14.

01:02:56.103 --> 01:03:02.417
TRAVIS: Vex, you're up first. You see the
spectral form starting to move towards you.

01:03:02.417 --> 01:03:04.255
What would you like to do?

01:03:04.255 --> 01:03:06.081
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to shoot an arrow at it.

01:03:06.081 --> 01:03:07.028
TRAVIS: You shoot an arrow at it?

01:03:07.028 --> 01:03:08.824
LAURA: From a blazing bowstring, because why not?

01:03:08.824 --> 01:03:11.393
TRAVIS: Okay. Roll to hit.

01:03:11.393 --> 01:03:14.324
LAURA: 25?

01:03:14.324 --> 01:03:16.384
TRAVIS: Hold on! Wait. There's music and shit.
Fuck.

01:03:16.384 --> 01:03:20.265
SAM: Shall I tell the unseen servants to change
the music?

01:03:20.265 --> 01:03:21.544
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:03:21.544 --> 01:03:23.634
SAM: Play something more rousing, please. 
Thank you.

01:03:23.639 --> 01:03:25.450
LIAM: What, what?

01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:29.758
SAM: I'm not in character now.
I'm just Scanlan.

01:03:29.761 --> 01:03:31.295
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, what was it?

01:03:31.295 --> 01:03:33.659
LAURA: Shit. 25.

01:03:33.659 --> 01:03:35.960
TRAVIS: Hit. Yeah, that definitely hits.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:45.002
LAURA: Okay. Oh jeez. I'm going to decide what I
should, you know, attack should-- Sure. Ten.

01:03:45.002 --> 01:03:49.498
Plus-- Oh, I didn't Hunter's Mark him 
because I'm stupid.

01:03:49.498 --> 01:03:51.371
TRAVIS: Yeah, too late for that.

01:03:51.371 --> 01:03:56.116
LAURA: 15 plus fire. 15 plus eight is 23.

01:03:56.116 --> 01:03:58.422
TRAVIS: 23, nice.

01:03:58.422 --> 01:04:02.922
LIAM: Look at Grog on that board, looks like he's
staring and judging the toys.

01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:06.756
LAURA: And then for my bonus action--

01:04:06.756 --> 01:04:08.135
LIAM: A what?

01:04:08.135 --> 01:04:13.803
LAURA: Can I have Trinket jump across the thing
that he just crossed and attack the ghost, too?

01:04:13.803 --> 01:04:16.255
TRAVIS: Yeah, roll an acrobatic check first.

01:04:16.255 --> 01:04:19.423
LAURA: Although I don't think I can actually have
him attack after I shot an arrow.

01:04:19.423 --> 01:04:21.175
TRAVIS: Oh, then no--

01:04:21.175 --> 01:04:24.021
LAURA: Yes, I can! Because I only
attacked once, that's how it works.

01:04:24.021 --> 01:04:28.314
LIAM: Bonus action? This is what all those ballet
classes for Trinket were for, right now.

01:04:28.314 --> 01:04:30.289
LAURA: That's an 11 for him.

01:04:30.577 --> 01:04:32.795
TRAVIS: For the acrobatic check?

01:04:32.795 --> 01:04:41.624
Trinket falls right on the plate. And he's like, 
boom. And then, because it shot all those darts,

01:04:41.624 --> 01:04:45.214
and Vax fell, and they were like, "Oh, none 
of the darts hit," they're all aimed down.

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:52.303
And Trinket takes like six darts.
He looks like the guy in The Godfather

01:04:52.303 --> 01:04:57.094
He's like, (distressed bear sounds, darts)
covered in darts. Trinket takes--

01:04:57.094 --> 01:05:04.015
SAM: Don't worry, Vex, it's not Real-Trinket, it's
Imagination-Trinket. Real-Trinket is still alive.

01:05:04.015 --> 01:05:05.915
TRAVIS: 24 points of damage.

01:05:05.915 --> 01:05:08.915
LAURA: That's a lot.

01:05:08.915 --> 01:05:13.207
TRAVIS: But he manages with his bear strength 
to pull himself just out of the line of fire.

01:05:13.207 --> 01:05:15.068
But he is right there.

01:05:15.068 --> 01:05:18.925
LAURA: Can he continue his attack? 
Probably not. Can I attack with my second arrow?

01:05:18.925 --> 01:05:22.911
TRAVIS: No. Vax, you're up.

01:05:22.911 --> 01:05:28.991
LIAM: I will run at the ghost. Right?
Because I have to get up to it.

01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:33.001
I could throw, but where's the fun in that? 
So I run at the ghost,

01:05:33.001 --> 01:05:38.258
and I'm going to use Whisper,
and I'm going to dagger, dagger, dagger.

01:05:38.258 --> 01:05:43.290
And I'm going to use the power of my deity
and do something called Divine Smiting.

01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:46.382
I've never told you guys what it's called,
but it's called Divine Smite.

01:05:46.382 --> 01:05:49.834
TRAVIS: Well, give me an acrobatics check, 
because you jump over the plate area.

01:05:49.834 --> 01:05:52.445
You want to run into melee with the ghost?

01:05:52.445 --> 01:05:56.873
LIAM: Yeah. So that's 33.

01:05:56.873 --> 01:05:59.451
TRAVIS: You learn from your previous errors
and man up,

01:05:59.451 --> 01:06:01.581
and you totally make it across just fine.

01:06:01.581 --> 01:06:06.703
LIAM: Yeah, I rolled lower than the last time.
Great. I jump across, run.

01:06:06.703 --> 01:06:08.900
How do I hit it with my knife?

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:10.120
TRAVIS: You stab it.

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:13.577
LIAM: Okay.

01:06:13.577 --> 01:06:15.067
TRAVIS: Roll to attack.

01:06:15.067 --> 01:06:18.066
LIAM: Okay, so I roll once. I'm going to use my--

01:06:18.066 --> 01:06:20.113
LAURA: Your second luck of the day.

01:06:20.113 --> 01:06:26.607
LIAM: I have endless luck. It's endless. 
That's a one. So instead I get a 19.

01:06:26.607 --> 01:06:29.236
TRAVIS: A 19. Which hits.

01:06:29.236 --> 01:06:35.602
LIAM: It does? Oh my gosh. God, there's
all these numbers on this piece of paper.

01:06:35.602 --> 01:06:37.125
LAURA: You've used two of them.

01:06:37.125 --> 01:06:46.433
LIAM: I've used 17 lucks. It was a six. I'm not
very good at math; I copied all of her answers.

01:06:46.433 --> 01:06:51.295
I think that's around 13, plus eight, 21, 
and then the Divine Smite,

01:06:51.462 --> 01:06:56.958
which I'm going to peg somewhere around 3d8. 
So a 31. That'll do.

01:06:56.958 --> 01:07:03.281
38. That was a 42. 44. 
Grog, 44 points of damage.

01:07:03.281 --> 01:07:06.039
TRAVIS: Boy, that's a lot of damage 
with that Divine Smite.

01:07:06.039 --> 01:07:09.009
LIAM: Feathers everywhere, David Bowie-style. 
Does it hurt the ghost?

01:07:09.009 --> 01:07:14.855
TRAVIS: Boy, it really does. You see him go like,
"Ouch!" And his form shivers and stuff,

01:07:14.855 --> 01:07:18.890
and he's like (pained sounds).
You see the area where you stab evaporates

01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:22.584
and then comes back into form, 
but he's still standing there

01:07:22.584 --> 01:07:26.685
He gleams at you 
with these fucking dead ghost eyes.

01:07:26.727 --> 01:07:33.672
LAURA: Is he a dwarf ghost? Because he seems
rather short. He is a dwarf ghost?

01:07:33.672 --> 01:07:36.405
TRAVIS: Yep. Yeah. He is a dwarf ghost.

01:07:36.405 --> 01:07:40.346
LIAM: But I can attack so many times, Grog. 
Can I do another quickie?

01:07:40.346 --> 01:07:41.997
LAURA: I only got one arrow. 
You only get one dagger.

01:07:41.997 --> 01:07:44.084
TRAVIS: That's fair. 
That sounds like a good idea.

01:07:44.084 --> 01:07:45.373
LIAM: Is that how it works?

01:07:45.373 --> 01:07:48.210
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's how it works.

01:07:48.210 --> 01:07:53.580
He turns to you after being like, 
"It hurts so bad." You really hurt him really bad.

01:07:54.406 --> 01:07:58.223
And he is going to use Horrifying Visage on you.

01:07:58.223 --> 01:07:59.769
LIAM: What the fuck is that?

01:07:59.769 --> 01:08:02.066
TRAVIS: Yeah, I need you to make a wisdom saving
throw.

01:08:02.066 --> 01:08:15.394
LIAM: A wisdom saving throw? Okay, so I don't have
any of that. Oh, that's good. I rolled an 18.

01:08:15.394 --> 01:08:20.657
TRAVIS: Oh, that succeeds. You see him almost
glare into your soul, you feel your little

01:08:20.657 --> 01:08:25.543
butthole pucker, and you're like, "Oh no, it's so
scary!" but you shake it off because you've seen

01:08:25.543 --> 01:08:30.330
so much worse in your time. Yeah. And you throw up
the double-birds, and he's like (hissing), and you

01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:33.777
shake it off. That's good.
Percy, it's your turn.

01:08:33.777 --> 01:08:37.736
TALIESIN: Yes. Well, I'm going to back up 
and take a shot at this--

01:08:37.736 --> 01:08:39.398
TRAVIS: Back away from the ghost, or towards him?

01:08:39.398 --> 01:08:42.511
TALIESIN: No, away from the ghost. Away from the
ghost a bit, and I'm going to take a shot.

01:08:42.511 --> 01:08:47.905
I'll just take one, since it seems we're being
sporting about it. So I'm going to use my magical

01:08:47.905 --> 01:08:58.216
psychic shot. And that's not bad. That's a 24.

01:08:58.216 --> 01:08:59.801
TRAVIS: 24 hits.

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:06.769
TALIESIN: All right. Well then, I'm going to do
that, plus this. And I'm also going to hit him

01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:08.695
with a bit of electricity, as well.

01:09:08.695 --> 01:09:09.717
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it.

01:09:09.717 --> 01:09:17.177
TALIESIN: Ooh, that's lovely. That's
ten points of damage, plus six points

01:09:17.177 --> 01:09:20.200
of psychic damage, 
plus four points of electricity.

01:09:20.221 --> 01:09:26.196
TRAVIS: That is just enough. You hit him, and his
form-- You hear this shriek, and he just--

01:09:26.196 --> 01:09:37.510
turns into a puff of smoke. 
Disappears into nowhere, and the ghost is gone.

01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:40.127
Calm retakes the hallway.

01:09:40.127 --> 01:09:41.854
LAURA: Back towards the tip.

01:09:41.854 --> 01:09:44.551
SAM: Yes, musicians, calm down.

01:09:44.551 --> 01:09:46.978
LIAM: Let's refocus on the shaft.

01:09:46.978 --> 01:09:52.859
TALIESIN: I'm going to peruse the rest of the--

01:09:52.859 --> 01:09:56.119
TRAVIS: Make a perception check to explore the
hallway.

01:09:56.119 --> 01:09:58.918
LIAM: Just the tip, though, Percy.

01:09:58.918 --> 01:10:06.594
TALIESIN: If I get too close to the tip, I might
experience a burning sensation from the torch. 20.

01:10:06.594 --> 01:10:14.910
TRAVIS: 20, yeah, that's great. You move forward,
and you see no doorways, no exits, but you do see

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:23.700
a line near the end of the hallway that seems to
be a bit of an inequality in the rocks. Almost

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:26.762
like if you push on it, something might happen.

01:10:26.762 --> 01:10:30.569
LAURA: Maybe you should push on it, Percy?

01:10:30.569 --> 01:10:32.811
LIAM: We should backtrack the way we came.

01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:36.043
TALIESIN: Really? All right, I'm pushing on it.

01:10:36.043 --> 01:10:39.748
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, you push on it.
Give me a strength check.

01:10:39.748 --> 01:10:41.239
TALIESIN: Oh, this will go well.

01:10:41.239 --> 01:10:42.844
LIAM: Push it real good.

01:10:42.844 --> 01:10:49.400
TALIESIN: Pushing. Push it. Oh no. 
That would be a--

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.325
LIAM: That's the lowest number 
you can get on that thing.

01:10:51.325 --> 01:10:53.691
TALIESIN: That is indeed the lowest number 
you can get.

01:10:53.691 --> 01:10:57.402
TRAVIS: Right. Strangely, you lean into it, about
to give it a big shove, but your feet slip out

01:10:57.402 --> 01:11:00.911
from under you on the slick rock. 
And you fall flat on your face, and you bite

01:11:00.911 --> 01:11:03.163
a bit of your tongue and lip.

01:11:03.163 --> 01:11:07.203
TALIESIN: (lisping) I could use some assistance 
with this. Please.

01:11:07.203 --> 01:11:09.792
SAM: I'll show you how it's done.

01:11:09.792 --> 01:11:17.416
Scanlan, in real life, is not a very strong
person, but I'm playing my character

01:11:17.416 --> 01:11:22.639
as very strong, so Scanlan runs in 
and pushes hard on the wall.

01:11:22.639 --> 01:11:25.612
TRAVIS: Great, yeah, make a strength check.

01:11:25.612 --> 01:11:30.824
SAM: Ooh. 16.

01:11:30.824 --> 01:11:35.748
TRAVIS: 16. You lean in and you push, having
Percy, just like little bloody mouth right next to

01:11:35.748 --> 01:11:42.008
you, and sure enough, the wall starts to move, but
you can see light coming from the other side. It's

01:11:42.008 --> 01:11:44.765
just too heavy for you to move.

01:11:44.765 --> 01:11:47.259
SAM: I need some help over here!

01:11:47.259 --> 01:11:50.796
LAURA: Trinket's going to run over. 
Damn it, he has to cross the thingy again.

01:11:50.796 --> 01:11:52.903
TALIESIN: He's going to have to cross the thingy
again.

01:11:52.903 --> 01:11:58.037
TRAVIS: "You know what, I got it." Grog goes up
towards the end of the hallway.

01:11:58.037 --> 01:12:02.143
He's like, "Maybe I'll just fucking handle
this, you guys, don't worry."

01:12:02.143 --> 01:12:12.181
And he rolls a million, and the door flies open. 
Almost comes off whatever invisible hinges it had.

01:12:12.181 --> 01:12:14.330
Like, rock falls out of the door.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.027
LIAM: Just like life.

01:12:16.027 --> 01:12:20.965
TRAVIS: Yeah. Pretty much. I know. Doors can't
faze me. The rest of you, it's a problem.

01:12:20.965 --> 01:12:27.975
Not always true. You see before you a lit cavern.
Something off in the distance, but you're still

01:12:27.975 --> 01:12:29.953
in the doorway. What do you do?

01:12:29.953 --> 01:12:32.297
SAM: A lit cabin?

01:12:32.297 --> 01:12:33.937
TRAVIS, LIAM, and TALIESIN: Cavern.

01:12:33.937 --> 01:12:38.273
LAURA: I'm going to shoot another oracle arrow
into the lit cavern.

01:12:38.273 --> 01:12:40.492
TRAVIS: Do you have another oracle arrow?

01:12:40.492 --> 01:12:41.990
LAURA: I do, I have one more.

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:45.015
TRAVIS: Yeah? Roll to attack. Shoot.

01:12:45.015 --> 01:12:46.770
LAURA: 26.

01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:51.833
TRAVIS: You nock, and you pull, and you release,
and your vision goes into the arrow, and it shoots

01:12:51.833 --> 01:12:58.286
forward. You see stone floors beneath you, and all
of a sudden, it shoots past what looks like a

01:12:58.286 --> 01:13:03.681
flowing fountain of water, and it just arcs past,
and you see as it clears past the fountain, a

01:13:03.681 --> 01:13:10.273
small, furry shape on the ground, and it hits into
a ground, and it scatters, and the arrow shatters

01:13:10.273 --> 01:13:11.802
on the floor.

01:13:11.802 --> 01:13:17.918
LAURA: There's a furry shape! There's an animal in
there. Let's go in! I walk into the room.

01:13:17.918 --> 01:13:25.392
TRAVIS: Okay. So. Would you all like to follow
her? You all want to go?

01:13:25.392 --> 01:13:28.495
LIAM: I'm going to hang back at the tip of the
wang there.

01:13:28.495 --> 01:13:30.577
TRAVIS: Vax hangs back.

01:13:30.577 --> 01:13:35.206
LAURA: Oh no, we all fell over.

01:13:35.206 --> 01:13:41.639
TRAVIS: You all fell over. There you go. So you
see this fountain right here.

01:13:41.639 --> 01:13:49.232
LAURA: Jesus H. That's lovely, Grog.

01:13:49.232 --> 01:13:56.244
TRAVIS: Scanlan right here, and Vax over here.

01:13:56.244 --> 01:14:03.454
LIAM: Yeah. I don't want to leave. I don't want to
go. I feel safe in the shaft.

01:14:03.454 --> 01:14:08.742
TRAVIS: There's a fountain right in front of you,
and as you go in, you see there appears to be

01:14:08.742 --> 01:14:17.063
like, just this rouge, flushed-skin type water
coming out of it. Some sort of fluid. And it's

01:14:17.063 --> 01:14:21.911
just a beautiful fountain, right in the middle of
the room. Circular, from what you can see.

01:14:21.911 --> 01:14:22.746
What do you do?

01:14:22.746 --> 01:14:24.776
LAURA: Where was the furry creature?

01:14:24.776 --> 01:14:27.059
TRAVIS: It was past the fountain somewhere, you're
not sure.

01:14:27.059 --> 01:14:30.595
LAURA: I'm going to look at the ground and see if
there's any traps.

01:14:30.595 --> 01:14:35.967
TRAVIS: Traps? Do a perception check. Is that what
you're doing for traps?

01:14:35.967 --> 01:14:37.141
SAM: I think it's investigation.

01:14:37.141 --> 01:14:38.939
TRAVIS: Okay, do roll an investigation check.

01:14:38.939 --> 01:14:39.959
LAURA: 12.

01:14:39.959 --> 01:14:43.882
TRAVIS: 12. There do not appear to be any traps.

01:14:43.882 --> 01:14:49.927
LAURA: Great. Then I walk forward towards the
fountain. And past it.

01:14:49.927 --> 01:14:54.941
SAM: I will stick with her. So I can protect her.

01:14:54.941 --> 01:14:56.860
LAURA: Thank you, Scanlan.

01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:59.136
TALIESIN: You're not doing the voice anymore?

01:14:59.136 --> 01:15:01.572
SAM: That's only when I in-character talk to
someone else.

01:15:01.572 --> 01:15:04.180
TALIESIN: Oh, so this is the narrative. The
narrative voice is different.

01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:12.119
TRAVIS: You see before you what looks like a dog.

01:15:12.119 --> 01:15:18.351
A tiny little dog. Where is the dog? 
Where's the dog gone?

01:15:18.355 --> 01:15:21.219
Right about here, at the edge of your vision.

01:15:21.219 --> 01:15:23.657
TALIESIN: Is the dog over there? By Bigby's Hand?

01:15:23.657 --> 01:15:25.488
LAURA: Do you want this to be a dog?

01:15:25.488 --> 01:15:28.376
TRAVIS: Sure, yeah, we'll use this to be a dog.
Here's the dog right here.

01:15:28.446 --> 01:15:29.782
SAM: Did you buy a dog?

01:15:29.782 --> 01:15:31.473
TRAVIS: No, it's one of Liam's. 
It was in the box.

01:15:31.473 --> 01:15:35.544
LIAM: Eight tubs of minis. Eight tubs of minis.
There's a die on the map.

01:15:35.544 --> 01:15:39.730
TRAVIS: You see a dog, his tail just sweeping
behind him.

01:15:39.730 --> 01:15:42.721
LAURA: Grog, can I cast Speak With Animals?

01:15:42.721 --> 01:15:44.851
TRAVIS: If you'd like to.

01:15:44.851 --> 01:15:47.111
LAURA: I want to. And I want to talk to him.

01:15:47.111 --> 01:15:48.563
TRAVIS: Go for it.

01:15:48.563 --> 01:15:53.923
LAURA: I want to say: Hey, dog. What are you doing
down here?

01:15:53.923 --> 01:16:01.010
TRAVIS: As you do that, the dog whips around 
and looks at you, jumps to its feet

01:16:01.016 --> 01:16:02.806
and starts to growl.

01:16:03.159 --> 01:16:08.987
Starts to growl and he's like "Intruder.
Intruder!" You see as these bone shards

01:16:08.987 --> 01:16:13.489
start to protrude from his back and shoulders. 
His spine starts to lengthen,

01:16:13.489 --> 01:16:19.800
and he's no longer a fucking dice dog. 
It is this massive thing.

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.263
SAM: Some sort of demon dog.

01:16:21.263 --> 01:16:23.753
LAURA: Oh shit. I immediately shoot an arrow at
him.

01:16:23.753 --> 01:16:25.098
TRAVIS: You do?

01:16:25.098 --> 01:16:27.242
LAURA: But I want to Hunter's Mark him first.

01:16:27.242 --> 01:16:29.174
TRAVIS: Roll to attack.

01:16:29.174 --> 01:16:31.715
SAM: Doesn't she have to step back to shoot an
arrow?

01:16:31.715 --> 01:16:33.128
LAURA: I'm not right on him.

01:16:33.128 --> 01:16:35.401
LIAM: You're at disadvantage if you're right up
against.

01:16:35.401 --> 01:16:37.464
LAURA: But I'm not right up against him.

01:16:37.464 --> 01:16:39.250
SAM: Well, ask the Bunion Master.

01:16:39.250 --> 01:16:41.116
LIAM: I mean, I just feel like that's a rule.

01:16:41.366 --> 01:16:43.642
TRAVIS: You're at disadvantage because you're so
close.

01:16:43.642 --> 01:16:45.451
SAM: Thank you, Grog. Thank you.

01:16:45.451 --> 01:16:48.538
LAURA: Fucking dick, Scanlan. Fine. 26.

01:16:48.538 --> 01:16:54.520
TRAVIS: 26. You hit the vicious hell hound. What's
your damage?

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.774
LAURA: Oh, okay.

01:16:56.774 --> 01:17:04.648
LIAM: Must be like a rottweiler or something then
because they're so mean. Not really. That's just a

01:17:04.648 --> 01:17:05.591
myth, isn't it?

01:17:05.591 --> 01:17:10.106
TALIESIN: I think it's just a myth. Although I had
a neighbor with a chihuahua once.

01:17:10.106 --> 01:17:11.778
LIAM: Maybe a chihuahua. It's probably a
chihuahua.

01:17:11.778 --> 01:17:13.117
TALIESIN: They're all bite-y.

01:17:13.117 --> 01:17:17.898
LAURA: That's 16 plus six is 22 plus six is 28.

01:17:17.898 --> 01:17:25.689
TRAVIS: 28 points of damage with one shot.
Amazing. Great. Is that the end of your turn?

01:17:25.689 --> 01:17:28.177
LAURA: I want Trinket to run up and attack him
too.

01:17:28.177 --> 01:17:29.119
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:17:29.119 --> 01:17:30.975
LAURA: He does, right?

01:17:30.975 --> 01:17:32.706
TRAVIS: Trinket runs up around the other side.

01:17:32.706 --> 01:17:34.469
LAURA: Oh he got a natural 20!

01:17:34.469 --> 01:17:35.567
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

01:17:35.567 --> 01:17:37.241
TALIESIN: That means something.

01:17:37.241 --> 01:17:43.553
TRAVIS: If you can't tell from her exuberance, a
natural 20 is like the best thing you can roll.

01:17:43.553 --> 01:17:44.806
LAURA: That's really good.

01:17:44.806 --> 01:17:46.825
LIAM: Have you played this with him before you
played with us?

01:17:46.825 --> 01:17:49.727
LAURA: So I happened to be in the same tavern that
he was in.

01:17:49.727 --> 01:17:54.042
SAM: Yeah, we all were Vax. Sorry, we didn't want
to tell you but we were all there, that's why we

01:17:54.042 --> 01:17:55.213
know how to play the game so well.

01:17:55.213 --> 01:18:01.132
LIAM: Why didn't you let me sleep in with Keyleth
then? Why am I here? Jeez.

01:18:01.132 --> 01:18:03.413
SAM: It's such a good game that we all wanted to
play and share it with you.

01:18:03.413 --> 01:18:05.140
LAURA: I thought you would really like it.

01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:07.504
LIAM: I want to fucking sleep in for once.

01:18:07.504 --> 01:18:09.660
SAM: But we also knew that we would probably win
because you don't know how to play.

01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:11.069
LAURA: Trinket attacks him.

01:18:11.069 --> 01:18:12.985
TRAVIS: Okay great. And what's the damage?

01:18:12.985 --> 01:18:14.036
LAURA: Oh, I don't know.

01:18:14.036 --> 01:18:16.374
TALIESIN: This has never happened before.

01:18:16.374 --> 01:18:17.802
LAURA: I know, he doesn't do this very often.

01:18:17.802 --> 01:18:19.112
TRAVIS: He critted.

01:18:19.112 --> 01:18:30.355
LAURA: He did. Ah! Okay, so 2d4 plus nine. Because
it's a claw attack.

01:18:30.355 --> 01:18:31.808
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:18:31.808 --> 01:18:35.590
LAURA: Okay. Where's my other-- there it is.

01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:40.706
TRAVIS: There's fucking mysterious music. Have the
people change it to some sort of--

01:18:40.706 --> 01:18:42.727
SAM: Oh sorry, change the music again please.

01:18:42.727 --> 01:18:44.393
TALIESIN: Switch tracks, my friend.

01:18:44.393 --> 01:18:47.856
LIAM: Is it like the ghost piano at the Magic
Castle?

01:18:47.856 --> 01:18:49.771
LAURA: 23!

01:18:49.771 --> 01:18:53.024
TRAVIS: Whoa, 23. Trinket putting out some
damage.

01:18:53.024 --> 01:18:54.474
LAURA: I mean that's pretty great, right?

01:18:54.474 --> 01:18:55.521
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's pretty good.

01:18:55.521 --> 01:18:58.340
LAURA: I should have had him do that before me, I
could have gotten sneak attack damage.

01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:03.484
TRAVIS: Yeah, seriously. Okay so, as Trinket
attacks and takes a vicious chunk out of the side

01:19:03.484 --> 01:19:04.739
of this hell hound right--

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:05.771
LAURA: With his claws!

01:19:05.771 --> 01:19:08.692
TRAVIS: You hear a growl even further into the
cavern.

01:19:08.692 --> 01:19:10.676
LAURA and TALIESIN: Oh no.

01:19:10.676 --> 01:19:14.153
LIAM: How far does this go? Oh look, isn't that
clever!

01:19:14.153 --> 01:19:19.206
LAURA: Oh it's boobies. I thought it was an anus.

01:19:19.206 --> 01:19:20.437
LIAM: It's tits.

01:19:20.437 --> 01:19:21.752
LAURA: I thought it was an anus.

01:19:21.752 --> 01:19:23.002
SAM: No, that's just the shape of the cavern.

01:19:23.002 --> 01:19:24.080
TRAVIS: No, these are caverns.

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.042
SAM: Yeah.

01:19:25.042 --> 01:19:26.153
LIAM: Caverns.

01:19:26.153 --> 01:19:31.702
TRAVIS: What are you smoking? And you see from
behind the fountain coming another hell hound to

01:19:31.702 --> 01:19:34.635
see what the cry of its fallen brethren are.

01:19:34.635 --> 01:19:38.721
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a run at the first one
and I'm going to throw my spear.

01:19:38.721 --> 01:19:40.913
TRAVIS: You're going to throw your spear?

01:19:40.913 --> 01:19:42.581
SAM: The spear that you picked up at the tavern?

01:19:42.581 --> 01:19:45.397
TALIESIN: I am. I pick up that tavern spear and
I'm going to throw it.

01:19:45.397 --> 01:19:49.348
TRAVIS: Actually, now the other ones as well, I
need you to roll initiative again.

01:19:49.348 --> 01:19:52.207
LIAM: Okay we're doing it again, let's roll one of
these little balls.

01:19:52.207 --> 01:19:53.154
SAM: 18.

01:19:53.154 --> 01:19:55.136
TALIESIN: 16 yet again.

01:19:55.136 --> 01:19:58.274
LAURA: 14.

01:19:58.274 --> 01:20:00.261
LIAM: 21.

01:20:00.261 --> 01:20:06.228
TRAVIS: 21. Vax, you, back near the tip, are up.

01:20:06.228 --> 01:20:10.253
LIAM: Okay, I click my boots. Do I have my boots?

01:20:10.253 --> 01:20:12.425
TRAVIS: Do you normally have your boots?

01:20:12.425 --> 01:20:13.196
LIAM: Always.

01:20:13.196 --> 01:20:14.144
TRAVIS: Then you do.

01:20:14.144 --> 01:20:19.898
LIAM: Fuck yeah! I click the boots, and I bolt
through, out the end of the penis and to the

01:20:19.898 --> 01:20:22.813
boobs, or the egg, or whatever it is. I go from
the tunnel--

01:20:22.813 --> 01:20:23.996
TRAVIS: The hallway.

01:20:23.996 --> 01:20:29.420
LIAM: Yeah, the hallway into the cavern. The first
round cavern that is identical to the next one.

01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:34.290
TRAVIS: Strange words coming out of your mouth.
You come into the cavern.

01:20:34.290 --> 01:20:42.677
LIAM: Painful stuff. Yeah, I'd like to run around
between my sister and Trinket and get up into the

01:20:42.677 --> 01:20:47.697
grill of that first spiky dog, because I should
have a better chance of hitting it because it's so

01:20:47.697 --> 01:20:49.554
preoccupied with my sister.

01:20:49.554 --> 01:20:52.957
TRAVIS: Move your little character wherever you'd
like to go, yeah.

01:20:52.957 --> 01:20:58.315
LIAM: Jeez. So I jump over here. So I bang like that,
I can jump over Grog, and I go (whoop), right up

01:20:58.315 --> 01:21:00.682
in the middle like that. And then I stab.

01:21:00.682 --> 01:21:02.459
TRAVIS: You stab. Roll to attack.

01:21:02.459 --> 01:21:06.652
LIAM: I'm going to roll twice. Because I'm feeling
good. Ooh, that's good. 30.

01:21:06.652 --> 01:21:07.919
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:21:07.919 --> 01:21:15.657
LIAM: Oh, it does. Okay. So I roll this pointy one
that's like a caltrop, and that's a two. And then

01:21:15.657 --> 01:21:21.068
I add eight to that, that's a ten. And then I roll
again for psychic damage. That's 12. Look at all

01:21:21.068 --> 01:21:32.195
these in a box, oh my God, look at that. 14,
eight, no. 25. 29. 32. 32, Grog.

01:21:32.195 --> 01:21:36.588
TRAVIS: With that first dagger, you sink it into
the side of the hell hound, and you hear a (pained squeal),

01:21:36.588 --> 01:21:42.763
and he recoils from the pain, and all of
a sudden, his flesh and fur just turns into flame,

01:21:42.763 --> 01:21:47.878
and he catches fire and burns into nothing. He
just absolutely disintegrates.

01:21:47.878 --> 01:21:50.562
LAURA: Does that hurt Trinket standing right next
to him?

01:21:50.562 --> 01:21:51.563
TRAVIS: No, it doesn't.

01:21:51.563 --> 01:21:54.852
LIAM: And then we all only get one attack per
turn, is that right?

01:21:54.852 --> 01:21:55.953
LAURA: Yeah.

01:21:55.953 --> 01:21:58.202
TRAVIS: Well, don't you have more attacks?
Normally I see you do a lot of shit.

01:21:58.202 --> 01:22:03.086
LIAM: I do, but before-- Yes. I have four more.
Five more, seven more attacks.

01:22:03.086 --> 01:22:05.065
TRAVIS: How about one more attack? Sounds good.

01:22:05.065 --> 01:22:07.960
LIAM: One more attack is good. It might be more,
but we'll just do one more.

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:10.509
LAURA: That's a really cool dagger.

01:22:10.509 --> 01:22:12.858
LIAM: That's a 31.

01:22:12.858 --> 01:22:14.504
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:22:14.504 --> 01:22:20.850
LIAM: Yeah. On that one, I'm throwing it, so
that's not as crazy because I kind of blew my wad

01:22:20.850 --> 01:22:22.533
on the first one. That's a nine.

01:22:22.533 --> 01:22:23.396
TRAVIS: A nine?

01:22:23.396 --> 01:22:24.193
LIAM: A nine.

01:22:24.193 --> 01:22:25.245
TRAVIS: Nine damage?

01:22:25.245 --> 01:22:26.869
LAURA: Trinket did more damage than that.

01:22:26.869 --> 01:22:28.049
TRAVIS: The bear did.

01:22:28.049 --> 01:22:29.365
LIAM: How much did he do total?

01:22:29.365 --> 01:22:30.268
LAURA: 23.

01:22:30.268 --> 01:22:33.842
LIAM: Were you here when I did, like, 30-something
on the attack just before?

01:22:33.842 --> 01:22:38.015
TRAVIS: This is not a competition. You hit it, and
it totally gets its attention. It sinks right into

01:22:38.015 --> 01:22:41.079
its shoulder blade, and it's (pained growling),
and focuses on you.

01:22:41.079 --> 01:22:42.527
LIAM: It focuses on me, but it was talking to
you.

01:22:42.527 --> 01:22:44.349
TRAVIS: That's true, yeah. Scanlan, you're up.

01:22:44.349 --> 01:22:54.011
SAM: I'm going to step forward and call to the
beast. "Beast, look in my eyes and follow my

01:22:54.011 --> 01:23:03.641
"commands!" And I will cast Dominate Monster on the
beast. He has to roll a wisdom save.

01:23:03.641 --> 01:23:05.079
TRAVIS: You got it. Okay.

01:23:05.079 --> 01:23:06.359
SAM: Against 22.

01:23:06.359 --> 01:23:07.961
LIAM: You must face Bavmorda.

01:23:07.961 --> 01:23:13.002
TRAVIS: 20. It fails. You dominate the monster.

01:23:13.002 --> 01:23:17.916
SAM: I command you, beast, to attack this bear.

01:23:17.916 --> 01:23:19.929
LAURA: Scanlan!

01:23:19.929 --> 01:23:21.960
SAM: Relentless attack!

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.364
LAURA: What the fuck?!

01:23:23.364 --> 01:23:27.510
SAM: I don't get to do this in real life, so I
thought I'd experiment with different things in

01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:28.841
fantasy land.

01:23:28.841 --> 01:23:29.955
LAURA: Asshole.

01:23:29.955 --> 01:23:33.276
TRAVIS: And next in the initiative order is
actually the hell hound, and he takes off running

01:23:33.276 --> 01:23:40.151
straight towards Trinket. Yeah, it's real
unfortunate. He's going to unleash a bite att--

01:23:40.151 --> 01:23:49.949
No, he's going to do Firebreath in a 15-foot cone.
Must make a DC 12 dexterity saving throw.

01:23:49.949 --> 01:23:53.464
LAURA: Who all is in that cone?

01:23:53.464 --> 01:23:56.160
TRAVIS: Roll a dexterity saving throw, Vex, Vax,
and Trinket.

01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:01.193
LIAM: Vex, Vax, and Trinket? Oh. Oh, my boots are
on, so I do better at that now.

01:24:01.193 --> 01:24:09.660
LAURA: Oh no. That's terrible for both of us.
Well, not bad for me. 18.

01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:10.756
LIAM: 21 for me.

01:24:10.756 --> 01:24:11.810
LAURA: 18 for me.

01:24:11.810 --> 01:24:12.990
TRAVIS: You both succeed.

01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:15.234
LAURA: Trinket, though, is a four.

01:24:15.234 --> 01:24:16.498
TRAVIS: Four.

01:24:16.498 --> 01:24:17.960
TALIESIN: A four?

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.117
LAURA: He's not very dexterous.

01:24:20.117 --> 01:24:23.407
TRAVIS: So Trinket takes 29 points of fire
damage.

01:24:23.407 --> 01:24:25.283
LIAM and LAURA: Oh no.

01:24:25.283 --> 01:24:28.768
LIAM: So what does he look like? Set the scene
for us.

01:24:28.768 --> 01:24:33.825
TRAVIS: You guys both take 19 points of fire
damage. Halved, because you made the save.

01:24:33.825 --> 01:24:35.983
SAM: Wait, 19 is half of what?

01:24:35.983 --> 01:24:36.872
TRAVIS: Wait.

01:24:36.872 --> 01:24:39.075
SAM: Of 29? That tracks for Grog, sure.

01:24:39.075 --> 01:24:41.093
LIAM: But what am I subtracting that from?

01:24:41.093 --> 01:24:43.009
LAURA: Your health.

01:24:43.009 --> 01:24:44.210
LIAM: What health?

01:24:44.210 --> 01:24:45.635
LAURA: How much health do you have?

01:24:45.635 --> 01:24:47.107
TRAVIS: Call it 14 points. We'll call it 14
points.

01:24:47.107 --> 01:24:49.412
LIAM: I feel fine.

01:24:49.412 --> 01:24:51.469
SAM: The BM is always right.

01:24:51.469 --> 01:24:55.464
LIAM: Percival, what do I subtract it from?

01:24:55.464 --> 01:24:56.639
TALIESIN: From your hit points.

01:24:56.639 --> 01:24:57.824
LIAM: What are hit points?

01:24:57.824 --> 01:24:59.475
TALIESIN: Your hit points are your hit points.

01:24:59.475 --> 01:25:01.130
LIAM: Is that over here somewhere?

01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:02.203
TALIESIN: I mean, I would hope so.

01:25:02.203 --> 01:25:03.302
TRAVIS: You can read, right?

01:25:03.302 --> 01:25:06.167
LIAM: I mean, I can. Doesn't mean I do.

01:25:06.167 --> 01:25:07.417
TRAVIS: Well, you should.

01:25:07.417 --> 01:25:10.825
SAM: Grog, this noob is bringing
the whole table down.

01:25:10.825 --> 01:25:12.904
TRAVIS: I know, it's terrible. I mean seriously.

01:25:12.904 --> 01:25:14.301
LIAM: That says my name, Vax'ildan--

01:25:14.301 --> 01:25:16.632
LAURA: Oh, right here.

01:25:16.632 --> 01:25:17.695
LIAM: Where?

01:25:17.695 --> 01:25:18.693
LAURA: Right. There.

01:25:18.693 --> 01:25:25.198
LIAM: Oh, I got a lot. That's so many hit points.
I bet I have the most in the group. So I take

01:25:25.198 --> 01:25:26.935
away, I think you said 14.

01:25:26.935 --> 01:25:29.107
LAURA: Jeez, Trinket's pretty close to dying.

01:25:29.107 --> 01:25:30.225
TRAVIS: Percival, you're up.

01:25:30.225 --> 01:25:35.669
TALIESIN: I've really been excited about the spear
so I'm going to run forward and throw my spear.

01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:37.565
TRAVIS: Okay, what's your speed? How far can you
move?

01:25:37.565 --> 01:25:39.303
TALIESIN: I can move 30.

01:25:39.303 --> 01:25:42.425
TRAVIS: 30? One, two, three--

01:25:42.425 --> 01:25:45.283
TALIESIN: One, two, three, four, five, six...

01:25:45.283 --> 01:25:49.340
TRAVIS: So unfortunately, Trinket stands between
you and the hell hound.

01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:54.042
TALIESIN: Well, I was going to angle out my little
walk a bit to the outskirts.

01:25:54.042 --> 01:25:55.442
TRAVIS: Out this way more?

01:25:55.442 --> 01:25:56.571
TALIESIN: Yeah, out that way more.

01:25:56.571 --> 01:25:57.734
TRAVIS: Okay, so maybe over here?

01:25:57.734 --> 01:26:01.203
TALIESIN: Right there. Yeah, like there. And I
think I can throw it--

01:26:01.203 --> 01:26:02.410
TRAVIS: You want to throw it?

01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:03.484
TALIESIN: Yeah, like a javelin, yes.

01:26:03.484 --> 01:26:05.342
TRAVIS: Okay, roll an attack at disadvantage.

01:26:05.342 --> 01:26:06.758
TALIESIN: Why disadvantage?

01:26:06.758 --> 01:26:08.880
TRAVIS: Because I've never seen you throw a
fucking spear before.

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:16.455
(laughter)

01:26:16.455 --> 01:26:18.731
TALIESIN: What is my attack with the spear?

01:26:18.731 --> 01:26:21.076
TRAVIS: Plus two.

01:26:21.076 --> 01:26:22.483
TALIESIN: All right.

01:26:22.483 --> 01:26:25.506
LAURA: Oh shit, that's really low. Roll high,
darling.

01:26:25.506 --> 01:26:28.316
TALIESIN: A seven then, if it's plus two.

01:26:28.316 --> 01:26:30.546
TRAVIS: Yeah, good. You throw the spear and it--

01:26:30.546 --> 01:26:31.709
SAM: Hits Trinket!

01:26:31.709 --> 01:26:37.269
TRAVIS: It just disappears. You're not quite sure
where but you hear a sploosh. You hear the splash

01:26:37.269 --> 01:26:40.524
as it seems to disappear into the fountain behind
the hell hound.

01:26:40.524 --> 01:26:48.224
TALIESIN: Well, fine then. I'm going to just sit
there and be disappointed then.

01:26:48.224 --> 01:26:53.053
TRAVIS: Good, nice. Vex, you're up.

01:26:53.053 --> 01:26:55.962
LAURA: Oh, okay.

01:26:55.962 --> 01:26:57.903
TRAVIS: You have a bonus action if you want it.

01:26:57.903 --> 01:27:01.404
TALIESIN: Okay. What can I do with a bonus action?
Can I just do whatever I like?

01:27:01.404 --> 01:27:02.936
SAM: I've seen you burn grits.

01:27:02.936 --> 01:27:04.960
TRAVIS: Yeah, I just assume you'll know that
better than me.

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:07.225
TALIESIN: I let you cook, this is your
mansion.

01:27:07.225 --> 01:27:08.684
SAM: That's true.

01:27:08.684 --> 01:27:12.150
TALIESIN: And my grits are best burnt. Makes them
a little crispy.

01:27:12.150 --> 01:27:21.063
LAURA: I'm going to-- &lt;i&gt;Trinket&lt;/i&gt; is going to bite
him back because he's a dick.

01:27:21.063 --> 01:27:22.793
TRAVIS: Nice, roll an attack.

01:27:22.793 --> 01:27:29.323
LAURA: Okay. That's good. 28.

01:27:29.323 --> 01:27:30.817
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

01:27:30.817 --> 01:27:39.941
LAURA: Okay. So he's going to do this. Ten for
him. Does he get my Hunter's Mark as well?

01:27:39.941 --> 01:27:41.156
TRAVIS: No.

01:27:41.156 --> 01:27:47.379
LAURA: All right. Just checking. And then I'm
going to shoot an arrow while he's doing that so

01:27:47.379 --> 01:27:48.784
the creature's distracted, right?

01:27:48.784 --> 01:27:51.127
TRAVIS: Sounds good.

01:27:51.127 --> 01:27:53.133
LIAM: Why do you decide for Trinket what Trinket
does?

01:27:53.133 --> 01:27:56.975
LAURA: Well, I mean, he's not at the table playing
right now, so I have to say what he's going to do.

01:27:56.975 --> 01:27:59.029
TRAVIS: He's outside.

01:27:59.029 --> 01:28:00.074
LAURA: No, he's right behind me.

01:28:00.074 --> 01:28:01.046
TRAVIS: Oh, he's asleep?

01:28:01.046 --> 01:28:01.999
LAURA: Yeah, he's right there.

01:28:01.999 --> 01:28:04.119
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry. He blends into the furniture.

01:28:04.119 --> 01:28:06.958
SAM: It's true, all my furniture is bearskin
furniture.

01:28:06.958 --> 01:28:08.879
TRAVIS: That's super insensitive.

01:28:08.879 --> 01:28:10.648
LIAM: But only since you met Vex.

01:28:10.648 --> 01:28:14.113
LAURA: I got 31.

01:28:14.113 --> 01:28:15.928
TRAVIS: 31 damage?

01:28:15.928 --> 01:28:17.130
LAURA: No, 31 to hit.

01:28:17.130 --> 01:28:18.325
TRAVIS: Oh, to hit. It hits.

01:28:18.325 --> 01:28:20.623
SAM: I don't even clean it, it's just bloody bear
skin.

01:28:20.623 --> 01:28:32.507
LAURA: You're terrible. 16, 17. Where are they?

01:28:32.507 --> 01:28:33.968
LIAM: Just make it up, this is imagination.

01:28:33.968 --> 01:28:35.268
TRAVIS: Are you lacking die?

01:28:35.268 --> 01:28:36.411
LAURA: I don't know.

01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:37.577
TRAVIS: How is that possible?

01:28:37.577 --> 01:28:39.291
LAURA: Oh, what did I say I was at?

01:28:39.291 --> 01:28:40.309
TRAVIS: 13.

01:28:40.309 --> 01:28:42.629
LAURA: 13? Okay, good. 13, 16, 17.

01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:43.817
TRAVIS: 17.

01:28:43.817 --> 01:28:44.714
LAURA: Yes.

01:28:44.714 --> 01:28:49.575
TRAVIS: And with that you hit the hell hound and
the arrow sinks in and he too starts to catch fire

01:28:49.575 --> 01:28:55.602
from the wound and he's like (howling), and he
just evaporates.

01:28:55.602 --> 01:28:56.761
LAURA: I killed it!

01:28:56.761 --> 01:28:58.432
TALIESIN: Look at that. That's brilliant.

01:28:58.432 --> 01:29:01.907
LAURA: It's dead. Trinket and I killed it! Good
job, darling.

01:29:01.907 --> 01:29:04.766
TRAVIS: Yeah. Not that's it's a competition, but
you've killed something, Trinket's killed

01:29:04.766 --> 01:29:06.875
something, and you've killed something.

01:29:06.875 --> 01:29:08.368
SAM: Any points?

01:29:08.368 --> 01:29:10.931
LIAM: Did I get any points? Did I get any XP?

01:29:10.931 --> 01:29:16.136
TRAVIS: There were only 450 to give out for the
entire game, so it's all been used.

01:29:16.136 --> 01:29:18.975
TALIESIN: You still have another 200 to give.

01:29:18.975 --> 01:29:23.260
TRAVIS: There is 200 more to give. You'll get 50
XP.

01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:24.183
LAURA: Thank you.

01:29:24.183 --> 01:29:25.113
TRAVIS: Thank you, Percival.

01:29:25.113 --> 01:29:26.089
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

01:29:26.089 --> 01:29:28.958
TRAVIS: I can only juggle so many, you know,
parrots at one time.

01:29:28.958 --> 01:29:31.798
LIAM: So how it works is you have to get all the
XP at the very beginning.

01:29:31.798 --> 01:29:35.206
TALIESIN: Yeah, the XB.

01:29:35.206 --> 01:29:37.183
LIAM: The XB; what does the B stand for?

01:29:37.183 --> 01:29:40.361
SAM: Boints. Xylophone bears.

01:29:40.361 --> 01:29:44.835
TRAVIS: So the hell hounds have been destroyed and
the cavern is again quiet. What would you like to do?

01:29:44.835 --> 01:29:49.739
LAURA: I want to run my hands through the
fountain.

01:29:49.739 --> 01:29:51.989
TRAVIS: Okay. So you go up to the fountain--

01:29:51.989 --> 01:29:53.940
SAM: I'd like to go to the other fountain and
do the same.

01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:57.065
TRAVIS: You can go to this one, yep.

01:29:57.065 --> 01:30:00.516
LAURA: Just so we can do this. In the fountain
water.

01:30:00.516 --> 01:30:03.927
TRAVIS: Roll a constitution saving throw.

01:30:03.927 --> 01:30:05.529
LAURA: Oh no!

01:30:05.529 --> 01:30:07.125
LIAM: Gently first, though.

01:30:07.125 --> 01:30:10.981
SAM: 11.

01:30:10.981 --> 01:30:11.989
LAURA: 14.

01:30:11.989 --> 01:30:13.055
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's just water.

01:30:13.055 --> 01:30:15.118
LAURA: Oh good. Okay. So I'm going to wash my
hands off.

01:30:15.118 --> 01:30:19.796
TRAVIS: So you notice as you're washing your hands
off right, it's a very nice color, Grog wanders off--

01:30:19.796 --> 01:30:21.979
SAM: Do the fountains get any harder?

01:30:21.979 --> 01:30:24.384
TRAVIS: No they don't. Just nice and yeah.

01:30:24.384 --> 01:30:26.518
TALIESIN: Is it hard water or soft water I think
is what he's asking.

01:30:26.518 --> 01:30:29.085
TRAVIS: It's a good question. Would you like to
roll an intelligence check?

01:30:29.085 --> 01:30:30.361
TALIESIN: I'm going to roll an intelligence check
on that.

01:30:30.361 --> 01:30:31.833
TRAVIS: Which fountain are you inspecting?

01:30:31.833 --> 01:30:33.805
TALIESIN: I'm inspecting Scanlan's fountain.

01:30:33.805 --> 01:30:37.595
TRAVIS: Okay, you come over to Scanlan's fountain
and you're inspecting that one as well.

01:30:37.595 --> 01:30:39.370
LIAM: Maybe you should taste it.

01:30:39.370 --> 01:30:42.412
LAURA: Shut up. That's-- no, he really shouldn't.

01:30:42.412 --> 01:30:43.677
TALIESIN: Ooh. Is this investigation?

01:30:43.677 --> 01:30:44.711
TRAVIS: Intelligence.

01:30:44.711 --> 01:30:47.682
TALIESIN: Intelligence? All right, then that's a
24.

01:30:47.682 --> 01:30:54.092
TRAVIS: 24, yeah, this is very soft water. It is
very nice. It's got like a salt treatment to it.

01:30:54.092 --> 01:31:00.933
It's very nice, yeah. It's good for your skin,
there's vitamins in there, there's potassium and

01:31:00.933 --> 01:31:03.080
mercury and stuff.

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:06.748
LAURA: Do you have any dessert? Do you have
servants making any dessert?

01:31:06.748 --> 01:31:08.316
SAM: In this or in the game?

01:31:08.316 --> 01:31:11.365
LAURA: In here, in the mansion.

01:31:11.365 --> 01:31:21.223
SAM: In the mansion. Sure, yes. We have some
desserts. Trying to think of vegan desserts. Not flan.

01:31:21.223 --> 01:31:23.732
TALIESIN: You know, you can make a very nice vegan
creme brulee.

01:31:23.732 --> 01:31:25.082
LIAM: Sorbet?

01:31:25.082 --> 01:31:33.474
SAM: Sorbet is right. It's just fruit and sugar,
right? All right. Five...six? Five. We're five.

01:31:33.474 --> 01:31:37.220
LAURA: Yeah. Well, six because we might have
extra. Trinket.

01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:40.785
SAM: Five pomegranate sorbets please.

01:31:40.785 --> 01:31:42.434
TRAVIS: Nice.

01:31:42.434 --> 01:31:44.351
SAM: Seeds in.

01:31:44.351 --> 01:31:48.933
TRAVIS: So as you're inspecting the fountains, you
notice that Grog, having watched you guys be very

01:31:48.933 --> 01:31:55.702
careful checking for traps and everything is doing
the same, he's trying to do his part. Yeah, and lo

01:31:55.702 --> 01:32:01.955
and behold he finds an edge in the wall just like
you found before and he pushes it open and inside

01:32:01.955 --> 01:32:05.501
there is 20 platinum.

01:32:05.501 --> 01:32:07.422
SAM: Wow!

01:32:07.422 --> 01:32:08.866
LAURA: 20 platinum?!

01:32:08.866 --> 01:32:14.313
TRAVIS: Yeah. "Guys! I found 20 platinum in this
secret passage."

01:32:14.313 --> 01:32:18.276
LAURA: Oh my god. Can I see some platinum too? Can
I go over there?

01:32:18.276 --> 01:32:21.765
TRAVIS: Platinum's mine, but you never know what
else is around. Maybe look for yourself.

01:32:21.765 --> 01:32:23.274
LAURA: I look for other secret doors.

01:32:23.274 --> 01:32:26.864
TRAVIS: All right, roll a perception check.
Investigation check!

01:32:26.893 --> 01:32:31.336
LAURA: Okay. 25.

01:32:31.336 --> 01:32:37.186
TRAVIS: 25? Yeah, in fact on the exact opposite
side of the cavern you find a similar door and do

01:32:37.186 --> 01:32:38.772
you want to push it open?

01:32:38.772 --> 01:32:39.662
LAURA: Yeah!

01:32:39.662 --> 01:32:44.304
TRAVIS: Yeah. So you push and there seems to be
something coiled up on the ground in the corner.

01:32:44.304 --> 01:32:48.276
LAURA: Is it a monster or is it platinum?

01:32:48.276 --> 01:32:51.126
TRAVIS: It's not a creature or anything. Do you
want it or not?

01:32:51.126 --> 01:32:53.050
LAURA: Does it look like platinum?

01:32:53.050 --> 01:32:54.588
TRAVIS: Could be.

01:32:54.588 --> 01:32:56.074
LAURA: Okay. Can I look at it?

01:32:56.074 --> 01:32:58.151
TRAVIS: Yeah. Roll a perception check.

01:32:58.151 --> 01:33:02.434
LAURA: 29.

01:33:02.434 --> 01:33:03.774
TRAVIS: It's a big pile of poop.

01:33:03.774 --> 01:33:04.984
LAURA: Aww.

01:33:04.984 --> 01:33:06.290
TRAVIS: You found a poo.

01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:07.492
LAURA: Grog.

01:33:07.492 --> 01:33:09.536
LIAM: May I search the bottom of each nipple?

01:33:09.536 --> 01:33:10.942
TRAVIS: Each what?

01:33:10.942 --> 01:33:12.159
LAURA: It's a fountain.

01:33:12.159 --> 01:33:13.376
LIAM: That's what I said.

01:33:13.376 --> 01:33:15.455
TRAVIS: You want to search the bottom of each
fountain?

01:33:15.455 --> 01:33:16.474
LIAM: Yeah.

01:33:16.474 --> 01:33:17.984
TRAVIS: Sure.

01:33:17.984 --> 01:33:19.536
LIAM: Like feel around, see if there's any loot.

01:33:19.536 --> 01:33:20.780
TRAVIS: Which one would you like to start on?
Scanlan's or--?

01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:21.861
LIAM: Well there's one right behind me.

01:33:21.861 --> 01:33:22.863
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.

01:33:22.863 --> 01:33:23.985
LIAM: I should do the one closest to me.

01:33:23.985 --> 01:33:24.944
TRAVIS: There you go.

01:33:24.944 --> 01:33:27.536
LIAM: I'm going to see if there's any traps in
there if I'm going to stick my hand deep into that

01:33:27.536 --> 01:33:28.580
thing.

01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:29.978
TRAVIS: Yeah, roll an investigation check.

01:33:29.978 --> 01:33:34.667
LIAM: Of course. Oh, that's really good. I'm
getting the hang of this. That is a 26.

01:33:34.667 --> 01:33:41.816
TRAVIS: There do not appear to be any traps. Yeah.
Bottom of the fountain you find-- it's like a

01:33:41.816 --> 01:33:47.157
mossy bottom and there's some pebbles, but it
seems like that might've come from the stones

01:33:47.157 --> 01:33:50.480
overhead, but there doesn't appear to be any
objects in the bottom of the fountain.

01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:52.769
LAURA: What's that door on the far end?

01:33:52.769 --> 01:33:54.616
SAM: Let's go investigate that door over there.

01:33:54.616 --> 01:33:56.425
TRAVIS: Who does?

01:33:56.425 --> 01:33:57.471
SAM: I'll go over there.

01:33:57.471 --> 01:33:58.470
TRAVIS: You'll go over there?

01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:59.166
SAM: Yeah.

01:33:59.166 --> 01:34:00.596
LAURA: Trinket's going to join him.

01:34:00.596 --> 01:34:03.711
TRAVIS: So Scanlan's little legs just like
(footsteps) all the way over here.

01:34:03.711 --> 01:34:07.898
There goes Trinket. So you see before you--

01:34:07.898 --> 01:34:10.770
LAURA: Trinket's going to bite Scanlan's
shoulder.

01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:12.245
TRAVIS: Roll to attack.

01:34:12.245 --> 01:34:15.286
LIAM: I love how automatic that was.

01:34:15.286 --> 01:34:21.385
LAURA: Oh, that's not my attack, 
it's Trinket's attack. 19.

01:34:21.385 --> 01:34:23.115
TRAVIS: 19. What's your AC?

01:34:23.115 --> 01:34:24.160
SAM: That hits.

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:25.702
TRAVIS: Ooh. Roll for damage.

01:34:25.702 --> 01:34:28.730
LAURA: Great. Okay. 
This is what you get, Scanlan.

01:34:28.730 --> 01:34:29.904
SAM: Sure.

01:34:29.904 --> 01:34:33.236
LAURA: 14.

01:34:33.236 --> 01:34:39.619
TRAVIS: 14 points of damage. 
The bear sinks its teeth into your shoulder

01:34:39.619 --> 01:34:41.703
and gives you a little jiggle.

01:34:41.703 --> 01:34:43.361
SAM: (groans)

01:34:43.361 --> 01:34:46.773
TRAVIS: That saliva starts to burn. 
Yeah, bear saliva.

01:34:46.773 --> 01:34:48.520
LAURA: Yeah, he doesn't brush his teeth.

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:52.745
SAM: Ow! Ouch! Why would you do that, Trinket?

01:34:52.745 --> 01:34:56.451
LAURA: (bear growling)

01:34:56.451 --> 01:34:58.938
TALIESIN: That's a very good Trinket. 
That's very impressive.

01:34:58.938 --> 01:35:02.095
LIAM: He's got breath worse than a decrepit old
dachshund, too.

01:35:02.095 --> 01:35:03.856
SAM: I feel like I should retaliate.

01:35:03.856 --> 01:35:05.316
LAURA: I don't think you should.

01:35:05.316 --> 01:35:08.120
SAM: But that might piss off Vex.

01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:12.696
TRAVIS: Might. There is also this incredible door
in front of you.

01:35:12.696 --> 01:35:19.452
LAURA: You should check out the door. 
He unbites you and licks your shoulder.

01:35:19.452 --> 01:35:22.484
Which really just adds more bacteria to it.

01:35:22.484 --> 01:35:25.401
SAM: I will inspect the door.

01:35:25.401 --> 01:35:27.371
TRAVIS: Make a perception check.

01:35:27.371 --> 01:35:31.439
SAM: Five.

01:35:31.439 --> 01:35:37.338
TRAVIS: Five. You see before you a door,
magnificent, brilliantly ornate. It's made of

01:35:37.338 --> 01:35:41.768
several different kinds of wood and iron. You know
everything about this.

01:35:41.768 --> 01:35:43.158
SAM: I open it.

01:35:43.158 --> 01:35:44.665
TRAVIS: How do you open it?

01:35:44.665 --> 01:35:46.113
SAM: Is there a handle?

01:35:46.113 --> 01:35:49.755
TRAVIS: Yes, there is, there is a latch.

01:35:49.755 --> 01:35:54.777
LIAM: This is game of fantasy and imagination, so
it's just going to open and not hurt us at all.

01:35:54.777 --> 01:35:56.926
SAM: I'll open the latch.

01:35:56.926 --> 01:36:00.159
TRAVIS: The door opens. It just opens.

01:36:00.159 --> 01:36:04.289
TALIESIN: What madness is this?!

01:36:04.289 --> 01:36:05.818
LIAM: This is a utopia!

01:36:05.818 --> 01:36:11.759
TRAVIS: The door swings open. You notice as it
opens there's a carving in the wood of a large

01:36:11.759 --> 01:36:18.896
tower. As it swings open, it reveals in front of
it a small structure about 30 to 50 feet out in

01:36:18.896 --> 01:36:20.857
front of you and darkness beyond.

01:36:20.857 --> 01:36:22.532
TALIESIN: Nothing happened when we opened the
door?

01:36:22.532 --> 01:36:23.198
TRAVIS: No.

01:36:23.198 --> 01:36:24.294
TALIESIN: Are you sure you're doing it right?

01:36:24.294 --> 01:36:26.227
TRAVIS: Yeah, shockingly.

01:36:26.227 --> 01:36:28.393
LAURA: What was outside of the door?

01:36:28.393 --> 01:36:35.873
TRAVIS: As Scanlan and Trinket are looking through
the doorway, they see a structure about 30 to 50

01:36:35.873 --> 01:36:40.882
feet away from the doorway. Further into another
space is just darkness beyond.

01:36:40.882 --> 01:36:45.956
LIAM: My own bathroom door in Whitestone hits me
for one point of bludgeoning damage every time I

01:36:45.956 --> 01:36:47.170
use it.

01:36:47.170 --> 01:36:49.071
TALIESIN: It's designed for that; it's a door!

01:36:49.071 --> 01:36:51.727
LIAM: This door is faulty.

01:36:51.727 --> 01:36:55.975
LAURA: We go through it. I want to walk towards
the structure.

01:36:55.975 --> 01:36:57.573
TRAVIS: You go through the doorway?

01:36:57.573 --> 01:36:59.909
SAM: I'm going through the doorway first with
Trinket.

01:36:59.909 --> 01:37:02.257
TRAVIS: Would everyone like to go through the
doorway?

01:37:02.257 --> 01:37:04.241
TALIESIN: I'm going to watch everyone else go
through the doorway.

01:37:04.241 --> 01:37:05.541
TRAVIS: You're going to stay behind?

01:37:05.541 --> 01:37:07.592
TALIESIN: I'm going to go through once they've
started to go through. I'm going to make sure

01:37:07.592 --> 01:37:09.194
everything's good.

01:37:09.194 --> 01:37:10.482
TRAVIS: Who goes first?

01:37:10.482 --> 01:37:11.515
SAM: I will go first.

01:37:11.515 --> 01:37:16.820
TRAVIS: Scanlan, you get to the doorway and the
second you start to cross the threshold, you feel

01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:21.487
the force start to pull you towards the door,
almost as if someone has removed the stopper from

01:37:21.487 --> 01:37:27.801
a bathtub. You feel yourself being pulled through.
I need everyone to make dexterity saving throws.

01:37:27.801 --> 01:37:28.788
LAURA: All of us?!

01:37:28.788 --> 01:37:29.749
TRAVIS: All of you.

01:37:29.749 --> 01:37:31.867
LIAM: Even if we didn't say we were going towards
the door?

01:37:31.867 --> 01:37:32.845
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:37:32.845 --> 01:37:34.480
LIAM: I knew it was too good to be true.

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:35.517
SAM: I rolled a one.

01:37:35.517 --> 01:37:36.772
LAURA: I rolled a one!

01:37:36.772 --> 01:37:38.124
TALIESIN: I rolled a 21.

01:37:38.124 --> 01:37:45.715
LAURA: Let's see what Trinket rolls. That's
cocked. Trinket rolled 18.

01:37:45.715 --> 01:37:48.099
TRAVIS: 18? Okay. Vax?

01:37:48.099 --> 01:37:49.716
LIAM: Vax'ildan rolled a 30.

01:37:49.716 --> 01:37:56.802
TRAVIS: 30. Everyone except for Vax and Percy are
immediately pulled through the threshold.

01:37:56.802 --> 01:37:58.522
LAURA: What about Grog?

01:37:58.522 --> 01:38:02.354
LIAM: Freddie. Up top!

01:38:02.354 --> 01:38:05.508
TRAVIS: That's a seven. Grog also pulled through
the doorway.

01:38:05.508 --> 01:38:08.210
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right, we didn't go through
the door.

01:38:08.210 --> 01:38:10.870
TRAVIS: Vax and Percy manage to cling to the side
of the threshold.

01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:12.776
LIAM: Fucking dummies, right?

01:38:12.776 --> 01:38:14.674
TALIESIN: This is why you never trust a door.

01:38:14.674 --> 01:38:19.915
TRAVIS: You still feel this force pulling you,
like there's been an atmospheric pull through the

01:38:19.915 --> 01:38:26.938
doorway. You hear, on the other side, your
comrades getting up, seemingly fine.

01:38:26.938 --> 01:38:30.549
LAURA: What a nice journey that was! I really
enjoyed that.

01:38:30.549 --> 01:38:36.458
TRAVIS: For you two, on this side of the door, the
pull is still incredibly strong. You can try and

01:38:36.521 --> 01:38:38.274
fight it or you can go through.

01:38:38.274 --> 01:38:41.330
TALIESIN: I'm curious to hear how this sensation
will be narrated.

01:38:41.330 --> 01:38:49.090
LIAM: Yeah, I'd like to wait and also to mull over
who is this more painful for: you, Vex'ahlia's

01:38:49.090 --> 01:38:55.058
husband and lover, or me, her oldest friend and
twin brother. It's hard to tell. Grog, can you

01:38:55.058 --> 01:38:56.873
enlighten us?

01:38:56.873 --> 01:39:01.178
TRAVIS: Yes. As you're mulling this over, you get
12 points of force damage.

01:39:01.178 --> 01:39:02.856
TALIESIN and LIAM: That's fine.

01:39:02.856 --> 01:39:05.069
LIAM: Let's feel this out.

01:39:05.069 --> 01:39:10.041
TALIESIN: I was curious what kind of hardware is
attaching this door to the wall? Is it standard

01:39:10.041 --> 01:39:12.136
brass brackets? Triple bracket?

01:39:12.136 --> 01:39:13.184
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:39:13.184 --> 01:39:17.528
TALIESIN: Does it have a two-way turn? Can you
describe this?

01:39:17.528 --> 01:39:23.054
TRAVIS: It's almost as if you saw it for yourself
with those descriptions. Really quite impressive.

01:39:23.054 --> 01:39:24.651
TALIESIN: Can you describe me seeing it for
myself?

01:39:24.651 --> 01:39:29.355
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's the triple brass tracket.
There's lumber and stone.

01:39:29.355 --> 01:39:30.717
TALIESIN: There is lumber and stone.

01:39:30.717 --> 01:39:33.461
TRAVIS: Iron. Gold inlay on the door.

01:39:33.461 --> 01:39:34.834
TALIESIN: That's quite nice.

01:39:34.834 --> 01:39:36.153
TRAVIS: Yep. And a picture of a tower.

01:39:36.153 --> 01:39:41.050
LIAM: While he studies the door, I'm studying
Percival. Does he look more rugged and

01:39:41.121 --> 01:39:45.710
good-looking as his hair is blown towards the
door, or less?

01:39:45.710 --> 01:39:48.570
TRAVIS: You know right when you slap someone after
you've had too much to drink and their face is

01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:51.884
doing the pull? That's what his face looks like
constantly.

01:39:51.884 --> 01:39:54.034
TALIESIN: Well, if you'd said &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;, I'm letting
go and I'm going through the door.

01:39:54.034 --> 01:39:59.116
TRAVIS: You let go and you go through the door.
Vax, you're the only one still on this side of the door.

01:39:59.116 --> 01:40:05.508
LIAM: Okay. I do a five-count: One, two, three,
four, five. And then I just go: Motherfucker! And

01:40:05.508 --> 01:40:08.074
I grip my own shoulders and dive.

01:40:08.074 --> 01:40:12.644
TRAVIS: Yeah. And you go right through the doorway
as well. You both fall with a clatter to the

01:40:12.644 --> 01:40:20.423
floor, and you notice that in front of you is a
structure.

01:40:20.423 --> 01:40:22.499
LIAM: The Pentagon.

01:40:22.499 --> 01:40:25.160
LAURA: What is this? Oh, look at all those
carpets. Do they fly?

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:27.265
LIAM: Is this Heaven?

01:40:27.265 --> 01:40:28.585
LAURA: Is this Heaven?

01:40:28.585 --> 01:40:31.619
TRAVIS: You're prone, Percy's prone.

01:40:31.619 --> 01:40:34.675
TALIESIN: I don't think I &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; go prone.

01:40:34.675 --> 01:40:35.901
TRAVIS: Really?

01:40:35.901 --> 01:40:37.184
TALIESIN: I don't think I can prone.

01:40:37.184 --> 01:40:38.357
LAURA: Really?

01:40:38.357 --> 01:40:40.354
TALIESIN: Let me double-check this. I don't
think I can.

01:40:40.354 --> 01:40:41.622
LIAM: Can you be pwned?

01:40:41.622 --> 01:40:43.172
TALIESIN: There's no pwning here.

01:40:43.172 --> 01:40:45.639
TRAVIS: You see before you--

01:40:45.639 --> 01:40:48.183
TALIESIN: Yep. I cannot be knocked prone.

01:40:48.183 --> 01:40:51.586
TRAVIS: Nice. You're on your feet.

01:40:51.586 --> 01:40:52.875
LAURA: Just Vax, then.

01:40:52.875 --> 01:40:54.674
LIAM: I also cannot be knocked prone.

01:40:54.674 --> 01:41:08.087
TRAVIS: You see before you a brilliant structure
in the shape of a circle. It's quite massive. Made

01:41:08.087 --> 01:41:12.444
of stone. There seems to be some sort of
architecture about it.

01:41:12.444 --> 01:41:16.516
SAM: Are we able to see inside, like we are right
now, Grog?

01:41:16.516 --> 01:41:17.693
TRAVIS: No.

01:41:17.693 --> 01:41:20.305
SAM: So we don't know that there's carpets in the
individual rooms in there?

01:41:20.305 --> 01:41:21.705
TRAVIS: No.

01:41:21.705 --> 01:41:23.619
LIAM: I can see them, though, right there.

01:41:23.619 --> 01:41:25.088
TRAVIS: Just pretend like you don't.

01:41:25.088 --> 01:41:27.655
LAURA: Are those doors, or are those windows on
the side?

01:41:27.655 --> 01:41:34.915
TRAVIS: Those are doors. You see on each side of
the structure, there are doors. Around you, you

01:41:34.915 --> 01:41:41.009
find yourself in a void, black space all around.
In fact, you turn around to see the doorway with

01:41:41.009 --> 01:41:42.862
which you came has disappeared.

01:41:42.862 --> 01:41:44.984
LAURA: What are we standing on?

01:41:44.984 --> 01:41:46.422
TALIESIN: That's really mysterious.

01:41:46.422 --> 01:41:50.720
TRAVIS: You're standing on stone, but in each
direction it just seems darkness after about 20 to

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:56.541
30 feet. There is no determinable light source.
It's just you're able to see here.

01:41:56.541 --> 01:42:01.438
SAM: I'm just gonna walk around the five-sided
circle and just make sure there's doors on each of

01:42:01.438 --> 01:42:02.797
its five sides.

01:42:02.797 --> 01:42:04.991
LAURA: They look like they have different symbols
on them.

01:42:04.991 --> 01:42:09.424
TRAVIS: Right. There is, in fact, doors on each
one of the faces. One of them appears to be open.

01:42:09.424 --> 01:42:11.737
LIAM: And is this also permanent marker?

01:42:11.737 --> 01:42:14.058
TRAVIS: Maybe.

01:42:14.058 --> 01:42:15.257
LIAM: All right.

01:42:15.257 --> 01:42:16.855
SAM: Which one is open?

01:42:16.855 --> 01:42:20.202
TRAVIS: It appears that the door on this side is
open.

01:42:20.202 --> 01:42:23.388
SAM: The one with the star on it. I'd like to go
investigate that door.

01:42:23.388 --> 01:42:29.354
TRAVIS: All right. Yes. So, you go over and find
this open door. And as you look, there is a symbol

01:42:29.354 --> 01:42:38.201
above the doorway. It seems to be the symbol of a
star. And the door is open. Would you like to

01:42:38.201 --> 01:42:39.179
investigate?

01:42:39.179 --> 01:42:40.129
SAM: I would like to investigate.

01:42:40.129 --> 01:42:41.446
TRAVIS: Roll an investigation check.

01:42:41.446 --> 01:42:43.818
LIAM: Grog, may I use an action to stand up?

01:42:43.818 --> 01:42:45.154
SAM: 24.

01:42:45.154 --> 01:42:47.948
TRAVIS: 24. Yes, you may stand up.

01:42:47.948 --> 01:42:48.978
LIAM: Yes!

01:42:48.978 --> 01:42:51.415
TRAVIS: You are facing the wrong way again.

01:42:51.415 --> 01:42:54.567
LIAM: That'll be my next action, to turn
around.

01:42:54.567 --> 01:43:01.275
TRAVIS: You see before you a wooden and iron door
with a handle. And it has been seemingly forced

01:43:01.275 --> 01:43:07.646
open. Inside, there is a room, and from what you
can see from your vantage point, it seems a very

01:43:07.646 --> 01:43:12.827
comfortable room. You see a rug on the floor, a
potted plant on the side, and what seems to be a

01:43:12.827 --> 01:43:14.424
chest at the end of the room.

01:43:14.424 --> 01:43:15.907
SAM: No traps that I saw?

01:43:15.907 --> 01:43:17.452
TRAVIS: Does not appear to be trapped.

01:43:17.452 --> 01:43:19.085
SAM: All right, I'll step into the room.

01:43:19.085 --> 01:43:20.329
TRAVIS: You step in.

01:43:20.329 --> 01:43:21.822
LIAM: Seems wise.

01:43:21.822 --> 01:43:34.263
SAM: While no one is looking at me, I will take
out a bit of meat and the poison I've never used

01:43:34.263 --> 01:43:42.962
in the game, it's called Death Blade Poison. I've
had it since we ran Pathfinder.

01:43:42.962 --> 01:43:44.728
LAURA: Oh shit.

01:43:44.728 --> 01:43:48.131
SAM: I'm gonna just tuck it into the meat. Just
keep it with me.

01:43:48.131 --> 01:43:56.363
LIAM: Oh no. I think you're supposed to keep what
you know and what you don't know separate.

01:43:56.363 --> 01:43:57.867
LAURA: But I know.

01:43:57.867 --> 01:44:04.322
LIAM: That's called, what was it-- Mata-gaming.
Mota-gaming?

01:44:04.322 --> 01:44:05.507
SAM: Meka-gaming.

01:44:05.507 --> 01:44:07.816
LIAM: Meka-gaming. You can't Mega Man-game--

01:44:07.816 --> 01:44:12.191
SAM: All right, I'm looking about the room for
anything interesting.

01:44:12.191 --> 01:44:14.283
TALIESIN: There's a potted plant.

01:44:14.283 --> 01:44:18.742
TRAVIS: From your investigation check, you saw
there was a potted plant on the side of the room.

01:44:18.742 --> 01:44:25.243
A nice rug on the floor. An open chest near the
back of the room, and it looks like to be just a

01:44:25.243 --> 01:44:27.284
simple table with chairs on the other wall.

01:44:27.284 --> 01:44:32.276
SAM: All right. I will look under the rug.

01:44:32.276 --> 01:44:34.109
TRAVIS: Under the rug?

01:44:34.109 --> 01:44:35.446
TALIESIN: Under the rug?

01:44:35.446 --> 01:44:37.299
TRAVIS: You pick up the rug?

01:44:37.299 --> 01:44:38.667
SAM: Just a little bit, yeah.

01:44:38.667 --> 01:44:42.112
TRAVIS: There's floor. Stone floor. A little
dusty.

01:44:42.112 --> 01:44:50.546
SAM: All right. What's that thing at the far side
of it? Is that a chest? That's an open chest,

01:44:50.546 --> 01:44:51.414
isn't it?

01:44:51.414 --> 01:44:52.963
TRAVIS: It does appear-- Yeah.

01:44:52.963 --> 01:44:54.782
SAM: I go look in the open chest.

01:44:54.782 --> 01:44:58.937
TRAVIS: Okay. You go and look in the chest. It is
an empty chest.

01:44:58.937 --> 01:45:02.089
SAM: Nothing's here, someone's been through here
already.

01:45:02.089 --> 01:45:05.781
LIAM: It's been about three minutes, I'd like to
use another action to face the same direction as

01:45:05.781 --> 01:45:07.258
everyone else.

01:45:07.258 --> 01:45:10.508
TRAVIS: Roll a dexterity check.

01:45:10.508 --> 01:45:16.212
LIAM: Okay. The boots have worn off, so I can only
roll this ball once. It's not very good.

01:45:16.212 --> 01:45:17.420
LAURA: Oh no, that's terrible.

01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:18.333
LIAM: 14.

01:45:18.333 --> 01:45:22.372
TRAVIS: In your effort to turn, you slip and you
catch yourself, and you face the same way as

01:45:22.372 --> 01:45:24.029
everyone else. Well done.

01:45:24.029 --> 01:45:26.212
LAURA: Yay. Can I walk up to the door in front of us?

01:45:26.212 --> 01:45:27.746
TRAVIS: Sure. Directly in front of you?

01:45:27.819 --> 01:45:28.526
LAURA: Yeah.

01:45:28.526 --> 01:45:30.102
TRAVIS: You walk up.

01:45:30.102 --> 01:45:32.551
TALIESIN: I want to take a look at the square, if
that's all right.

01:45:32.551 --> 01:45:34.251
TRAVIS: Percy, you go up to the square.

01:45:34.251 --> 01:45:37.448
SAM: There's nothing in this one, guys.

01:45:37.448 --> 01:45:41.059
LAURA: Well, maybe there's one in the room with
the-- Is that a money symbol?

01:45:41.059 --> 01:45:44.313
TRAVIS: It does appear to be a money symbol.

01:45:44.313 --> 01:45:46.267
LAURA: Can I go in the money room?

01:45:46.267 --> 01:45:49.336
TRAVIS: Would you like to try and open the door?

01:45:49.336 --> 01:45:50.461
LAURA: Yeah!

01:45:50.461 --> 01:45:51.852
TRAVIS: You go to the door.

01:45:51.852 --> 01:45:53.087
LAURA: Yeah.

01:45:53.087 --> 01:45:54.426
TRAVIS: Doesn't seem to open.

01:45:54.426 --> 01:45:55.853
LAURA: Is it locked?

01:45:55.853 --> 01:46:00.745
SAM: Maybe the symbols correspond to us. The star
being me, because I'm the star. Money for you,

01:46:00.745 --> 01:46:04.849
because you're greedy. The square for Vax, because
he's a square.

01:46:04.849 --> 01:46:07.416
TALIESIN: It could be money for me, because I have
it.

01:46:07.416 --> 01:46:09.789
LAURA: Well, I have it now too, darling.

01:46:09.789 --> 01:46:14.086
TALIESIN: That is fair, we actually both have it
at this point. I'm going to try my door, the

01:46:14.086 --> 01:46:15.148
square.

01:46:15.148 --> 01:46:18.011
LAURA: Maybe a circle for Percy, because there's a
circle on his glasses.

01:46:18.011 --> 01:46:23.051
TRAVIS: Percy goes and reaches out, tries the
handle. Door doesn't seem to open. You do notice,

01:46:23.051 --> 01:46:28.978
there's not just the handle, there seem to be five
inlaid gems above the handle.

01:46:28.978 --> 01:46:31.304
TALIESIN: What sort of five inlaid gems?

01:46:31.304 --> 01:46:33.600
TRAVIS: They're fucking gems.

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:38.166
LAURA: Five gems on each door, or five gems, one
gem on each door?

01:46:38.166 --> 01:46:42.135
TRAVIS: Five gems above the handle, they're all
very shiny.

01:46:42.135 --> 01:46:43.488
LIAM: Circle door.

01:46:43.488 --> 01:46:46.467
SAM: Are there any gems on my door, or are they
all gold?

01:46:46.467 --> 01:46:51.443
TRAVIS: In fact, as you all communicate with each
other, these doors seem to be identical. A handle

01:46:51.443 --> 01:46:57.653
with five gems above each handle, and one of the
gems seems to be glowing.

01:46:57.653 --> 01:46:59.717
LAURA: Can I push on the glowing gem?

01:46:59.717 --> 01:47:01.457
TRAVIS: Nothing happens.

01:47:01.457 --> 01:47:03.400
LAURA: Can I push on all the other ones?

01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:08.255
TRAVIS: Nothing seems to happen when you push on
the gems.

01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:10.229
LAURA: Can I pull the glowing one out?

01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:15.908
TRAVIS: It's inlaid in the wall, it's just
attached. As you're all examining your doors, you

01:47:15.908 --> 01:47:28.157
hear a sound, almost like a grunt. Vex, behind
you, you hear a sound.

01:47:28.157 --> 01:47:30.753
SAM: Almost like a grunt.

01:47:30.753 --> 01:47:33.998
TRAVIS: Almost like a wicked grunt.

01:47:33.998 --> 01:47:36.608
LAURA: Is it Grog? Is Grog farting behind me?

01:47:36.608 --> 01:47:43.488
TRAVIS: No. You hear footsteps walk up behind you,
as a fist grabs the back of your neck and

01:47:43.488 --> 01:47:54.178
slams your face into the door. Grog seemingly has
changed into some sort of other creature.

01:47:54.178 --> 01:47:55.954
LAURA: What is that thing?

01:47:55.954 --> 01:47:58.991
LIAM: I know what that is. But that's Liam, not
Vax.

01:47:58.991 --> 01:48:00.355
TRAVIS: That's a natural 20.

01:48:00.355 --> 01:48:01.654
LAURA: You rolled a natural 20 against me?

01:48:01.654 --> 01:48:15.295
TRAVIS: I actually did, which is shocking. You
take 19 points of bludgeoning damage.

01:48:15.295 --> 01:48:18.104
LAURA: Oh. Fuck you.

01:48:18.104 --> 01:48:20.005
TRAVIS: Do you turn around and face your
attacker?

01:48:20.005 --> 01:48:21.257
LAURA: Yeah.

01:48:21.257 --> 01:48:27.022
TRAVIS: There's a fucking doppelgänger behind you.
This amorphous, shapeless creature has come up

01:48:27.022 --> 01:48:29.587
behind you and is trying to attack.

01:48:29.587 --> 01:48:32.822
LAURA: Is it trying to be like me? Is it going to
take the shape of me?

01:48:32.822 --> 01:48:34.152
TRAVIS: I don't know, he's just back there.

01:48:34.152 --> 01:48:35.630
LAURA: Trinket runs up and attacks him from the
other--

01:48:35.630 --> 01:48:38.982
TRAVIS: He makes another attack before you have a
chance to communicate with your bear.

01:48:38.982 --> 01:48:40.666
LIAM: Yeah, they're very fisty.

01:48:40.666 --> 01:48:45.227
TRAVIS: That's a natural one. He misses. He swings
forward with his other hand and takes a chip out

01:48:45.227 --> 01:48:46.712
of the door.

01:48:46.712 --> 01:48:52.758
LAURA: Right. Trinket runs up behind him. I
Hunter's Mark him, and Trinket bites him.

01:48:52.758 --> 01:48:54.466
TRAVIS: He bites him?

01:48:54.466 --> 01:48:55.372
LAURA: Yeah.

01:48:55.372 --> 01:48:57.437
TRAVIS: Roll to attack. Oh God.

01:48:57.437 --> 01:49:00.071
LAURA: Natural 20!

01:49:00.071 --> 01:49:01.964
LIAM: Ooh, Trinket is killing it!

01:49:01.964 --> 01:49:04.478
LAURA: Oh. Why doesn't he do this in real life?

01:49:04.478 --> 01:49:06.769
TRAVIS: I don't know.

01:49:06.769 --> 01:49:08.132
LIAM: Irony.

01:49:08.132 --> 01:49:11.621
LAURA: Ten. 19.

01:49:11.621 --> 01:49:13.532
TRAVIS: 19 damage?

01:49:13.532 --> 01:49:14.882
LAURA: 19 damage.

01:49:14.882 --> 01:49:16.614
LIAM: Na-na-na-na-na-na.

01:49:16.614 --> 01:49:18.463
LAURA: Na-na-na-na-nineteen.

01:49:18.463 --> 01:49:23.108
TRAVIS: He takes a bite out, and you see like a
purplish blood start to pour from this wound, and

01:49:23.108 --> 01:49:25.070
he takes a big bite out of him.

01:49:25.070 --> 01:49:33.901
LAURA: Okay. Then &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; am going to, for &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt;
attack, use my Rope of Entanglement on the

01:49:33.901 --> 01:49:35.299
doppelgänger.

01:49:35.299 --> 01:49:36.319
TRAVIS: You are very close.

01:49:36.319 --> 01:49:37.175
LAURA: Yeah.

01:49:37.175 --> 01:49:38.308
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:49:38.308 --> 01:49:42.426
SAM: Was Grog always a doppelgänger?

01:49:42.426 --> 01:49:44.349
LAURA: Is Grog a doppelgänger?

01:49:44.349 --> 01:49:46.020
TRAVIS: Make a strength check.

01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:47.362
LIAM: You don't know.

01:49:47.362 --> 01:49:50.573
TALIESIN: He may have been. We don't know.

01:49:50.573 --> 01:49:51.853
LIAM: We don't know.

01:49:51.853 --> 01:49:54.198
TALIESIN: We've all got a Grog we don't know
about.

01:49:54.198 --> 01:49:56.157
LAURA: Strength. 16.

01:49:56.157 --> 01:50:03.774
TRAVIS: 16. Unfortunately, the rope goes over and
he just shakes it off, just slips the rope.

01:50:03.774 --> 01:50:05.370
LAURA: Aww, that's bullshit.

01:50:05.370 --> 01:50:07.107
TRAVIS: Yeah, well he's a tricky one, this guy.

01:50:07.107 --> 01:50:09.348
TALIESIN: I want to start running towards where
this commotion is.

01:50:09.348 --> 01:50:10.717
LIAM: Yeah, I'm right around the corner.

01:50:10.717 --> 01:50:12.383
TRAVIS: Is there a commotion? Did she call out?

01:50:12.383 --> 01:50:13.705
TALIESIN: Did you call out?

01:50:13.705 --> 01:50:17.567
LIAM: We didn't hear oof, aaf, or the bear going
(growling)?

01:50:17.567 --> 01:50:21.195
TRAVIS: I mean, you seem to be pretty preoccupied
with these doors in front of you.

01:50:21.195 --> 01:50:24.504
SAM: I'm looking at a ficus in my room. Seems
nice.

01:50:24.504 --> 01:50:27.130
TRAVIS: He will take another swing at you.

01:50:27.130 --> 01:50:28.253
LAURA: No!

01:50:28.253 --> 01:50:30.843
LIAM: I feel like my twin sense would have kicked
in.

01:50:30.843 --> 01:50:35.430
TRAVIS: Probably. It's a little delayed right now.
You keep tripping over everything.

01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:37.330
TRAVIS: 16.

01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:39.530
LAURA: 16 to hit? Doesn't hit me.

01:50:39.530 --> 01:50:43.964
TRAVIS: He misses on the first one. Shit. 13.

01:50:43.964 --> 01:50:47.198
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to kick him in the crotch!

01:50:47.198 --> 01:50:49.353
TRAVIS: Roll to attack.

01:50:49.353 --> 01:50:58.685
LAURA: I don't want to use that one. I'll use this
one. That's terrible. Wait, what do I add? Is this

01:50:58.685 --> 01:50:59.957
just a regular attack?

01:50:59.957 --> 01:51:02.194
TRAVIS: Yeah, just a straight roll with your
strength modifier.

01:51:02.194 --> 01:51:05.480
LAURA: Oh, well, that would be a two.

01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:12.783
TRAVIS: That misses. You go to kick and he just
like Jean Claude Van Damme jump splits. And then

01:51:12.783 --> 01:51:14.182
comes right back down.

01:51:14.182 --> 01:51:17.485
LAURA: Okay. Shit. Trinket's going to attack him.

01:51:17.485 --> 01:51:18.649
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:51:18.649 --> 01:51:26.222
LAURA: He's going to bite him. So that is 25 for
Trinket.

01:51:26.222 --> 01:51:27.638
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

01:51:27.638 --> 01:51:31.027
LAURA: 12!

01:51:31.027 --> 01:51:32.808
TRAVIS: 12 points of damage?

01:51:32.808 --> 01:51:33.712
LAURA: Yes.

01:51:33.712 --> 01:51:35.743
TRAVIS: Okay. He's still up.

01:51:35.743 --> 01:51:39.842
LAURA: I'm going to go "Doppeljenga!"

01:51:39.842 --> 01:51:41.613
TRAVIS: Doppeljenga?

01:51:41.613 --> 01:51:42.774
LAURA: Yes.

01:51:42.774 --> 01:51:45.936
TRAVIS: You all hear "doppeljenga!" What would
you like to do?

01:51:45.936 --> 01:51:47.714
LIAM: I'm running towards the sound of the sister.

01:51:47.714 --> 01:51:52.174
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Vax comes charging around the
corner. Percy comes skipping around the corner.

01:51:52.174 --> 01:51:53.813
TALIESIN: Yes, right there.

01:51:53.813 --> 01:52:03.092
TRAVIS: Beautiful. The doppelganger will take one
more swipe at you. Yeah, he's just furious. 23.

01:52:03.092 --> 01:52:04.809
LAURA: Ooh, that hit me.

01:52:04.809 --> 01:52:06.258
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

01:52:06.258 --> 01:52:07.815
LIAM: (growling)

01:52:07.815 --> 01:52:09.930
LAURA: What are these weird sounds coming from
you?

01:52:09.930 --> 01:52:12.460
LIAM: It's not coming from me at all, you're just
imagining it in your brain.

01:52:12.460 --> 01:52:14.215
TRAVIS: You take 14 points of bludgeoning damage.

01:52:14.215 --> 01:52:15.507
LAURA: Fuck. All right.

01:52:15.507 --> 01:52:17.834
TRAVIS: Yep. Vax. You get there quick.

01:52:17.834 --> 01:52:27.193
LIAM: Okay so I'm going to throw Whisper and bamf
to this motherfucker. At advantage. I'm getting

01:52:27.193 --> 01:52:29.545
the hang of this. That's a 28 to hit.

01:52:29.545 --> 01:52:30.918
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

01:52:30.918 --> 01:52:36.923
LIAM: Okay. Where the fuck is the four-- there it
is. (counting)

01:52:36.923 --> 01:52:44.205
LAURA: 52 points of damage so far. Fuck. Kill
him!

01:52:44.205 --> 01:52:56.111
LIAM: 44 for the first and a paladin attack, we'll
go attack attack and I'll use my bonus action to

01:52:56.111 --> 01:52:57.655
attack--

01:52:57.655 --> 01:52:59.951
TRAVIS: I will say because you and Percy were
up at the same time you get one attack.

01:52:59.951 --> 01:53:00.835
LIAM: One attack?

01:53:00.835 --> 01:53:01.832
TRAVIS: One attack.

01:53:01.832 --> 01:53:10.233
LIAM: Well that's how Flungeons and Kragens work.
So one more attack. That is a 25 to hit.

01:53:10.233 --> 01:53:11.358
TRAVIS: It hits.

01:53:11.358 --> 01:53:14.860
LIAM: Which is a little bit less. That's a seven.

01:53:14.860 --> 01:53:16.104
TRAVIS: A seven?

01:53:16.104 --> 01:53:17.056
LIAM: Yeah.

01:53:17.056 --> 01:53:18.133
LAURA: Just a little less.

01:53:18.133 --> 01:53:27.958
TRAVIS: Yeah. Got it. All right. Percy, you may do
whatever you want. He is bleeding a bunch.

01:53:27.958 --> 01:53:31.172
LAURA: Ooh, maybe just flick him in the forehead.

01:53:31.172 --> 01:53:35.472
TALIESIN: I'm just going to walk up and slap him
with the glove.

01:53:35.472 --> 01:53:36.533
LIAM: Yes.

01:53:36.533 --> 01:53:37.353
TRAVIS: Just a slap?

01:53:37.353 --> 01:53:38.380
TALIESIN: I'm just going to do a slap.

01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:39.808
SAM: Insult his honor?

01:53:39.808 --> 01:53:41.158
TRAVIS: A regular glove or with--?

01:53:41.158 --> 01:53:48.923
TALIESIN: Oh no, with my fancy glove. I'm going to
use the fancy glove. Let's see, where is that?

01:53:48.923 --> 01:53:51.312
TRAVIS: How about you roll an attack and add your
strength modifier?

01:53:51.312 --> 01:53:52.673
TALIESIN: Oh no, there's actually a thing for
this.

01:53:52.673 --> 01:53:53.499
TRAVIS: Oh, is there?

01:53:53.499 --> 01:53:55.095
TALIESIN: Yeah, oh yeah, I have numbers.

01:53:55.095 --> 01:53:57.150
SAM: This is his electric glove.

01:53:57.150 --> 01:53:59.576
TALIESIN: 23 to hit.

01:53:59.576 --> 01:54:00.629
TRAVIS: That hits, yes.

01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:14.064
TALIESIN: And that's 14 points of damage and then
he has to make a constitution save or he's

01:54:14.064 --> 01:54:15.136
stunned.

01:54:15.136 --> 01:54:18.916
TRAVIS: He doesn't need to make a constitution
saving throw because you slap him and his lower

01:54:18.916 --> 01:54:21.003
jaw just flies off of his face.

01:54:21.003 --> 01:54:22.927
TALIESIN: That's very, very pleasing.

01:54:22.927 --> 01:54:30.236
TRAVIS: It just sprays purple gore all over Vex
and Vax. Just this snowcone of gore.

01:54:30.236 --> 01:54:31.961
TALIESIN: Is there none on Trinket? Is Trinket--

01:54:31.961 --> 01:54:35.451
TRAVIS: No, the way you came up and smacked him he
went that way and Trinket was like "Yeah, nicely

01:54:35.451 --> 01:54:45.009
"done." You have removed this doppelganger. So Grog
has been removed from your party.

01:54:45.009 --> 01:54:47.844
LAURA: What? Grog's been a doppelganger this
entire time?

01:54:47.844 --> 01:54:49.367
TRAVIS: It seems to be.

01:54:49.367 --> 01:54:54.502
SAM: Scanlan falls to his knees, feeling
a great pain in his soul. A hollowness that wasn't

01:54:54.502 --> 01:54:55.626
there before.

01:54:55.626 --> 01:54:57.797
TALIESIN: Oh god, Scanlan's another doppleganger,
quick, kill him.

01:54:57.797 --> 01:55:02.628
SAM: I can't believe I lost me mate. What what?

01:55:02.628 --> 01:55:05.097
TRAVIS: Yep, good.

01:55:05.097 --> 01:55:07.387
SAM: Do I get any XP for that?

01:55:07.387 --> 01:55:14.104
TRAVIS: Nope. You are now wrestling with the loss
of clearly your favorite and strongest party

01:55:14.104 --> 01:55:18.178
member. And we will take a break at this moment.

01:55:18.178 --> 01:55:20.343
(yelling)

01:55:20.343 --> 01:55:22.173
LIAM: This is the most fun game!

01:55:22.173 --> 01:55:24.039
LAURA: Oh good, we can eat our sherbet. Or whatever
it is that we got.

01:55:24.039 --> 01:55:26.334
TALIESIN: I think it was pomegranate sherbet.

01:55:26.334 --> 01:55:32.366
TRAVIS: We will return in a moment. I wanted to
thank also Kristen Mack made this wood burned DM's

01:55:32.366 --> 01:55:34.973
screen. Which is super, super impressive.

01:55:34.973 --> 01:55:38.243
LAURA: Who made all those little stick figure
drawings?

01:55:38.243 --> 01:55:39.674
TRAVIS: This is actually Arcade.

01:55:39.674 --> 01:55:40.741
LAURA: Really?

01:55:40.741 --> 01:55:41.731
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:55:41.731 --> 01:55:43.037
LAURA: Aww, that's awesome.

01:55:43.037 --> 01:55:51.697
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's amazing. We will be giving away
this amazing black walnut hero vault which will be

01:55:51.697 --> 01:55:58.892
signed by the cast. And the word-- am I doing this
right?-- in the chat is Regerts.

01:55:58.892 --> 01:56:00.262
LIAM: Regerts?

01:56:00.262 --> 01:56:01.439
LAURA: Regerts! No regerts!

01:56:01.439 --> 01:56:02.532
LIAM: Can you spell Regerts?

01:56:02.532 --> 01:56:13.429
TRAVIS: Just regerts. R-E-G-E-R-T-S. So "regerts"
to win this amazing Wyrmwood dice vault. And we

01:56:13.429 --> 01:56:15.536
will be back in a moment.

01:56:15.536 --> 01:56:17.869
LAURA: Oh my goodness!

01:56:17.869 --> 02:14:55.497
[break]

02:14:55.497 --> 02:14:59.586
TRAVIS: Welcome back. That's my best Mercer. Is
that--?

02:14:59.586 --> 02:15:01.184
LAURA: Oh, yeah!

02:15:01.184 --> 02:15:10.476
TRAVIS: We did have a winner in La Chaté. The
winner is Avarlic. Or, Ava Rolic. A-V-A-R-L-I-C.

02:15:10.476 --> 02:15:15.796
Congratulations, you are winning this gorgeous
Walnut Hero Vault. Signed by all of us at

02:15:15.796 --> 02:15:18.783
Critical Role.

02:15:18.783 --> 02:15:20.513
LAURA: Yay.

02:15:20.513 --> 02:15:27.864
TRAVIS: Let's get back
in. So one quick note. I got a little confused,

02:15:27.864 --> 02:15:35.493
actually. When Vex strode up to this door that had
the money symbol on it, and she placed her hand

02:15:35.493 --> 02:15:43.334
on the handle, one of those inlaid gems of the
five lit up. So now there are two lit up gems in

02:15:43.334 --> 02:15:44.532
the door.

02:15:44.532 --> 02:15:51.702
LAURA: Ooh. That's probably important. I wonder if
we touch it too many times without knowing what

02:15:51.702 --> 02:15:54.655
we're supposed to do if they, like, explode, and
then we can't open it at all.

02:15:54.655 --> 02:15:58.466
TALIESIN: I think all of us have to be touching
one of the doors at the same time. We should

02:15:58.466 --> 02:15:59.482
surround the tower.

02:15:59.482 --> 02:16:00.717
SAM: Wait, it's still glowing now, right?

02:16:00.717 --> 02:16:03.918
TRAVIS: As she's holding it, it's, yeah.

02:16:03.918 --> 02:16:06.281
LAURA: Oh, but all of us reach for a door at the
same time!

02:16:06.281 --> 02:16:09.140
TALIESIN: Yes, let's all go and touch doors.

02:16:09.140 --> 02:16:12.868
LAURA: What about Scanlan's door? Are there any
jewels lit up on your door?

02:16:12.868 --> 02:16:16.706
SAM: The same two jewels are lit up on mine.

02:16:16.706 --> 02:16:18.466
LAURA: Really?

02:16:18.466 --> 02:16:20.191
SAM: Is that true?

02:16:20.191 --> 02:16:27.057
TRAVIS: Actually, in your door, all the jewels,
they are not lit up. But if you explore other doors.

02:16:27.057 --> 02:16:28.432
LIAM: Scanlan?

02:16:28.432 --> 02:16:29.431
SAM: Oi.

02:16:29.431 --> 02:16:30.832
LIAM: No, not Scanlan. Scanlan.

02:16:30.832 --> 02:16:31.813
SAM: Right.

02:16:31.813 --> 02:16:34.510
LIAM: I'm out of vegan wine. Could you get some
more vegan wine in, please?

02:16:34.510 --> 02:16:39.445
SAM: Servants. Continue the creepy music and bring
us more wine, please.

02:16:39.445 --> 02:16:42.171
LIAM: Thank you.

02:16:42.171 --> 02:16:45.219
TRAVIS: The more you drink, the better you play.

02:16:45.219 --> 02:16:46.433
LAURA: Yeah.

02:16:46.433 --> 02:16:49.485
SAM: Are you sure we shouldn't go wake up the
others upstairs?

02:16:49.485 --> 02:16:52.829
TRAVIS: No, we're too far in it now. We've formed
an elite group here.

02:16:52.829 --> 02:16:57.620
SAM: I guess it's not the others. It's just Pike,
because Keyleth is dead.

02:16:57.620 --> 02:17:00.708
LAURA: Well, no. No, Keyleth is dead in the game.

02:17:00.708 --> 02:17:02.171
SAM: No, she's really dead.

02:17:02.171 --> 02:17:08.348
LAURA: So all of us should touch a door at the
same time. Yes?

02:17:08.348 --> 02:17:09.829
TALIESIN: I'm going to touch a door.

02:17:09.829 --> 02:17:11.031
LAURA: Wait, at the same time.

02:17:11.031 --> 02:17:13.519
TALIESIN: Well, since you're already touching a
door, I'm going to touch the next door.

02:17:13.519 --> 02:17:17.694
LAURA: I'm not touching it yet. I let go of it,
because I got attacked by a doppelganger.

02:17:17.694 --> 02:17:19.304
TALIESIN: Well, then I'll go touch--

02:17:19.304 --> 02:17:20.648
TRAVIS: Did you let go of the door?

02:17:20.648 --> 02:17:21.790
LAURA: Did I?

02:17:21.790 --> 02:17:23.010
TRAVIS: Did you?

02:17:23.010 --> 02:17:24.804
LAURA: I did. Well, I was getting attacked, so I'm
assuming.

02:17:24.804 --> 02:17:26.812
LIAM: You were dealing with a melted humanoid.

02:17:26.812 --> 02:17:28.988
TRAVIS: Would you like to grab the handle again?

02:17:28.988 --> 02:17:30.882
LAURA: I'm going to wait until other people grab
their handles.

02:17:30.882 --> 02:17:32.091
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

02:17:32.091 --> 02:17:33.712
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to go back to my
square.

02:17:33.712 --> 02:17:35.229
LAURA: And then all of us can time it.

02:17:35.229 --> 02:17:38.658
LIAM: I'll go to my circle. Circle door.

02:17:38.658 --> 02:17:41.151
LAURA: So Scanlan should go to the triangle.

02:17:41.151 --> 02:17:43.797
TALIESIN: ("Scanlan" voice) Go to the triangle, Scanlan.

02:17:43.797 --> 02:17:46.646
SAM: What is that stupid voice you're using?

02:17:46.646 --> 02:17:49.308
TALIESIN: That's you, that's what you sound like.
All the time.

02:17:49.308 --> 02:17:52.237
SAM: No, my character in the game talks like
this.

02:17:52.237 --> 02:17:54.750
TALIESIN: Your character in the game talks a bit
stupid.

02:17:54.750 --> 02:17:57.525
SAM: Yeah. All right, on the count of three.

02:17:57.525 --> 02:18:00.705
LIAM: You are a world-class performer.

02:18:00.705 --> 02:18:03.201
LAURA: Do we touch it on three, or do we touch it
after three?

02:18:03.201 --> 02:18:04.758
SAM: I'm representing my character!

02:18:04.758 --> 02:18:06.622
LAURA: On three, or after three?

02:18:06.622 --> 02:18:08.801
SAM: On three! On three!

02:18:08.801 --> 02:18:10.213
LAURA: All right.

02:18:10.213 --> 02:18:12.177
LIAM: On free? Three or free?

02:18:12.177 --> 02:18:13.351
TALIESIN: Not on four.

02:18:13.351 --> 02:18:14.507
SAM: Free.

02:18:14.507 --> 02:18:16.038
LAURA: One. Two.

02:18:16.038 --> 02:18:17.484
EVERYONE: Three.

02:18:17.484 --> 02:18:24.182
TRAVIS: You grab the handles, and you see as three
gems light up while two do not.

02:18:24.182 --> 02:18:31.669
SAM: We've got the wrong doors. We got the wrong
doors! Yours is correct, Vex, because you are

02:18:31.669 --> 02:18:32.810
greedy.

02:18:32.810 --> 02:18:34.695
LAURA: Yeah, ooh. Okay.

02:18:34.695 --> 02:18:36.724
SAM: I'm a cube. I'm a cube.

02:18:36.724 --> 02:18:39.362
LAURA: Oh, you're a cube! Because you've got a
dick that's a cube!

02:18:39.362 --> 02:18:40.670
SAM: Switch with me, Percy!

02:18:40.670 --> 02:18:41.769
TALIESIN: I'll switch with you, that's fine.

02:18:41.769 --> 02:18:43.825
LIAM: That makes sense, that makes sense.

02:18:43.825 --> 02:18:46.605
LAURA: And maybe Vax is--

02:18:46.605 --> 02:18:50.617
TRAVIS: Three of the five gems lit up.

02:18:50.617 --> 02:18:53.478
LAURA: --a triangle, because he stabs.

02:18:53.478 --> 02:18:57.638
LIAM: Dagger, dagger, dagger? Maybe three daggers?
Three sides? Let's try it.

02:18:57.638 --> 02:19:01.729
LAURA: Percy, you have circle glasses, right, that
could be something.

02:19:01.729 --> 02:19:03.163
TALIESIN: I do have circle glasses.

02:19:03.163 --> 02:19:06.652
LIAM: Well, it matches the symbol for your home a
little bit.

02:19:06.652 --> 02:19:08.153
SAM: Oh, the de Rolo!

02:19:08.153 --> 02:19:12.767
LIAM: De Roll-o. That's what it was all along.

02:19:12.767 --> 02:19:20.173
TALIESIN: Oh my god, I've never heard that before.
No one has never made that joke. I can't imagine

02:19:20.173 --> 02:19:21.909
I've been going my entire life.

02:19:21.909 --> 02:19:24.782
LIAM: You are the richest, most powerful people in
town. Who is looking down on you?

02:19:24.782 --> 02:19:25.826
LAURA: One. Two.

02:19:25.826 --> 02:19:27.501
ALL: Three.

02:19:27.501 --> 02:19:29.710
TRAVIS: All five gems light up.

02:19:29.710 --> 02:19:31.731
LAURA: We're so smart!

02:19:31.731 --> 02:19:35.661
TRAVIS: You hear a lock release, and the door,
with the weight of your hand on it, starts to

02:19:35.661 --> 02:19:37.019
swing open.

02:19:37.019 --> 02:19:39.035
LAURA: I go in. Is there a chest?

02:19:39.035 --> 02:19:40.344
TRAVIS: You just walk in?

02:19:40.344 --> 02:19:42.758
LAURA: I check for traps?

02:19:42.758 --> 02:19:45.537
TRAVIS: Roll an investigation check.

02:19:45.537 --> 02:19:46.483
LAURA: Okay.

02:19:46.483 --> 02:19:48.226
SAM: What are you drinking, piss? What is that?

02:19:48.226 --> 02:19:49.404
TRAVIS: Apple juice.

02:19:49.404 --> 02:19:50.812
SAM: Oh. That's a lot of apple juice.

02:19:50.812 --> 02:19:51.797
TRAVIS: Yeah, man.

02:19:51.797 --> 02:19:53.680
SAM: I don't think I've drank that much apple
juice since I was eight.

02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:55.440
TRAVIS: Yeah, well, I'm kind of doing Grog.

02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:57.343
LAURA: 14.

02:19:57.343 --> 02:20:05.103
TRAVIS: 14. You look around the room. You see no
traps. Doesn't seem to be trapped in any way.

02:20:05.103 --> 02:20:08.386
LAURA: What about the chest? Is it trapped?

02:20:08.386 --> 02:20:13.504
TRAVIS: Would you like to check the chest for
traps? Roll an investigation check.

02:20:13.504 --> 02:20:17.920
LAURA: 18.

02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:20.283
TRAVIS: 18. Does not appear to be trapped.

02:20:20.283 --> 02:20:21.769
LAURA: Can I open it?

02:20:21.769 --> 02:20:23.986
TRAVIS: You can. The chest opens.

02:20:23.986 --> 02:20:27.333
LAURA: Oh, is it a mimic or is it a chest?

02:20:27.333 --> 02:20:33.155
TRAVIS: No, you open it, and inside you see a
small vial with a little liquid.

02:20:33.265 --> 02:20:34.751
LAURA: What's it look like?

02:20:34.751 --> 02:20:37.028
TRAVIS: It looks like a greater healing potion.

02:20:37.028 --> 02:20:42.761
LAURA: Oh. Okay. What's that circle on the table
behind me?

02:20:42.761 --> 02:20:47.830
TRAVIS: During your investigation check of the
room, you see the rug, the potted plant, the

02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:55.211
chest, the desk and the chair. You also see above
you, in the ceiling, it seems to be a hatch above

02:20:55.211 --> 02:20:57.389
you. An iron hatch in the ceiling.

02:20:57.389 --> 02:21:02.868
LAURA: Is it bars or is it solid?

02:21:02.868 --> 02:21:05.274
TRAVIS: Solid plate metal.

02:21:05.274 --> 02:21:10.546
TALIESIN: I will go into my room. Check for traps,
check underneath the carpet, check the desk for

02:21:10.546 --> 02:21:12.933
anything interesting and then I'm going to open my
chest.

02:21:12.933 --> 02:21:14.817
TRAVIS: Okay. Roll an investigation.

02:21:14.817 --> 02:21:16.275
TALIESIN: I will.

02:21:16.275 --> 02:21:18.077
LAURA: I took my potion, right?

02:21:18.077 --> 02:21:20.365
TALIESIN: That's terrible. Eight.

02:21:20.365 --> 02:21:26.167
TRAVIS: Eight. You look under the rug. There is
nothing under the rug. You don't see any immediate

02:21:26.167 --> 02:21:33.078
traps. You go over to check the desk. Nothing
seems to be wrong with the desk. However, as you

02:21:33.078 --> 02:21:43.373
are checking your desk for traps, you feel the
slashing whip of twigs and thorns across your back

02:21:43.373 --> 02:21:49.357
as this twig blight has come across the room and
attacks you from behind.

02:21:49.357 --> 02:21:50.848
LIAM: It's a tree creature.

02:21:50.848 --> 02:21:55.175
TALIESIN: I'm going to turn around and start
slashing at it with my sword.

02:21:55.175 --> 02:21:58.049
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Hold on, he attacks first.

02:21:58.049 --> 02:21:59.368
TALIESIN: Yes, that's fair.

02:21:59.368 --> 02:22:00.339
TRAVIS: A 21.

02:22:00.339 --> 02:22:01.322
TALIESIN: That hits.

02:22:01.322 --> 02:22:02.351
TRAVIS: It does hit?!

02:22:02.351 --> 02:22:03.655
TALIESIN: Yeah, 21 hits. Yes.

02:22:03.655 --> 02:22:05.960
TRAVIS: That is surprising. You're going to take a
whopping--

02:22:05.960 --> 02:22:09.283
SAM: Grog, what is with your voice?

02:22:09.283 --> 02:22:15.708
TRAVIS: A whopping five points of piercing
damage.

02:22:15.708 --> 02:22:18.104
TALIESIN: Five points of piercing damage. All
right.

02:22:18.104 --> 02:22:22.542
TRAVIS: It's very hard to sustain this
personality.

02:22:22.542 --> 02:22:25.527
SAM: What are you talking about?!

02:22:25.527 --> 02:22:27.845
TRAVIS: You turn and you start slashing.

02:22:27.845 --> 02:22:32.105
TALIESIN: I'm going to make three quick slashes
with my sword.

02:22:32.105 --> 02:22:34.222
LIAM: It's like a medium pain reaction.

02:22:34.222 --> 02:22:36.078
TRAVIS: Can you give me an ABC?

02:22:36.078 --> 02:22:38.486
TALIESIN: Oh my god. Two natural 20s.

02:22:38.486 --> 02:22:40.239
TRAVIS and LIAM: Ooh!

02:22:40.239 --> 02:22:44.167
TALIESIN: And a 21.

02:22:44.167 --> 02:22:50.439
TRAVIS: Your might is clearly on display in this
visceral and violent outburst.

02:22:50.439 --> 02:22:58.349
TALIESIN: I'm attempting to carve it into a shape,
so I'm going to slowly carve it into a lovely

02:22:58.349 --> 02:23:04.752
standing statuary of Keyleth. May she rest in
peace.

02:23:04.752 --> 02:23:09.514
TRAVIS: Oh, indeed. In the most glorious Edward
Scissorhands movements you ever gestured, there

02:23:09.514 --> 02:23:19.392
before you stands a very dead, but green standing
statuary of Keyleth. Very much no longer a threat

02:23:19.392 --> 02:23:20.613
to you.

02:23:20.613 --> 02:23:22.277
TALIESIN: Quite nice. Quite fitting.

02:23:22.277 --> 02:23:24.150
TRAVIS: Leaning against the wall.

02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:25.449
TALIESIN: Now I'll open my chest.

02:23:25.449 --> 02:23:31.822
TRAVIS: Yes, you go to the chest. It opens and
inside, you find a small vial. Greater healing

02:23:31.822 --> 02:23:33.154
potion.

02:23:33.154 --> 02:23:37.938
LAURA: I'm going to stand at the corner of my room
and aim--

02:23:37.938 --> 02:23:39.195
TRAVIS: Which corner?

02:23:39.195 --> 02:23:40.225
LAURA: My room.

02:23:40.225 --> 02:23:42.334
TRAVIS: Which corner?

02:23:42.404 --> 02:23:45.541
SAM: "My room."

02:23:45.541 --> 02:23:53.896
LAURA: This corner right here and aim up at the
hatch. Is anything happening?

02:23:53.896 --> 02:23:55.465
TRAVIS: When you aim at it?

02:23:55.465 --> 02:23:56.927
LAURA: Yeah.

02:23:56.927 --> 02:24:02.537
TRAVIS: Your shoulders begin to burn ever so
slightly.

02:24:02.537 --> 02:24:04.699
LAURA: Does it look like there's a lock on the
hatch?

02:24:04.699 --> 02:24:05.935
TRAVIS: No.

02:24:05.935 --> 02:24:08.466
LAURA: Does it look like there's a handle on the
hatch?

02:24:08.466 --> 02:24:09.696
TRAVIS: Nope.

02:24:09.696 --> 02:24:12.092
LAURA: Does it look like it opens outward or
inward?

02:24:12.092 --> 02:24:13.531
TRAVIS: You can't tell.

02:24:13.531 --> 02:24:17.722
SAM: I'm going in to investigate my room. One.

02:24:17.722 --> 02:24:28.788
TRAVIS: Cool. You go in, you walk in and you're
facing backwards. You fall down and it seems to be

02:24:28.788 --> 02:24:31.468
a very normal room.

02:24:31.468 --> 02:24:33.421
SAM: I'll open the trunk.

02:24:33.421 --> 02:24:39.527
TRAVIS: Okay. You go forward and as you get to the
trunk, the mimic opens its mouth.

02:24:39.527 --> 02:24:41.907
SAM: (yelling)

02:24:41.907 --> 02:24:45.089
TRAVIS: A pseudopod attacks you.

02:24:45.089 --> 02:24:47.359
SAM: A pseudopod attacks me?

02:24:47.359 --> 02:24:50.113
TRAVIS: You become attached--

02:24:50.113 --> 02:24:51.985
LAURA: To the chest?

02:24:51.985 --> 02:24:53.521
TRAVIS: It has you and it does--

02:24:53.521 --> 02:24:59.513
TALIESIN: Mimics are the worst. Just made of
promises--

02:24:59.513 --> 02:25:01.683
TRAVIS: 16 points of damage.

02:25:01.683 --> 02:25:03.931
LAURA: (laughs) 16?

02:25:03.931 --> 02:25:06.126
SAM: 16 points of damage.

02:25:06.126 --> 02:25:13.855
TRAVIS: It grabs you and it wraps up with its
pseudopod and because you're so small, you're now

02:25:13.855 --> 02:25:17.320
grappled and it covers your mouth so you cannot
scream.

02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:19.712
SAM: Nor cast a spell.

02:25:19.712 --> 02:25:20.929
TRAVIS: Indeed.

02:25:20.929 --> 02:25:28.040
SAM: Unless I have a spell that does not need a
vocal thing. Let me just check.

02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:32.358
TALIESIN: Also grappled, I don't know if you can
actually move your hands either.

02:25:32.358 --> 02:25:34.162
SAM: Let's see here.

02:25:34.162 --> 02:25:37.261
TRAVIS: You are grappled for the moment, Scanlan.

02:25:37.261 --> 02:25:39.401
SAM: Sure. Carry on--

02:25:39.401 --> 02:25:40.682
TRAVIS: Anyone else?

02:25:40.682 --> 02:25:46.954
LIAM: Yeah. I'll do all the same shit. I want to,
before I check for traps at the door, perception

02:25:46.954 --> 02:25:48.371
check for anything--

02:25:48.371 --> 02:25:52.655
TRAVIS: Well, don't be so excited about it. It's a
unique room. You don't know what adventures lie

02:25:52.655 --> 02:25:57.115
inside! So roll an investigation check. See what
happens.

02:25:57.115 --> 02:26:13.233
LIAM: Why'd I roll two? I don't know why I rolled
two. I'll take the lower of them. 23.

02:26:13.233 --> 02:26:16.130
TRAVIS: Your arm falls off. It just falls off
behind you.

02:26:16.130 --> 02:26:18.091
LIAM: I do not understand this game, Grog!

02:26:18.091 --> 02:26:20.067
TRAVIS: No, you come in the room.

02:26:20.067 --> 02:26:22.220
LIAM: Jeepers creepers.

02:26:22.220 --> 02:26:29.585
TRAVIS: You come in. The room does not appear to
be trapped. You do sense movement somewhere in the room.

02:26:29.585 --> 02:26:33.171
LIAM: Do I know what direction I sense the
movement from?

02:26:33.171 --> 02:26:34.407
TRAVIS: It's in front of you.

02:26:34.407 --> 02:26:36.593
LIAM: In front of me? Is it the rug or the chest?

02:26:36.593 --> 02:26:37.900
TRAVIS: You're not sure.

02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:40.962
LIAM: Hmm. What is this thing moving? Sam, wiggle
your hand.

02:26:40.962 --> 02:26:42.486
LAURA: Scanlan.

02:26:42.486 --> 02:26:49.349
LIAM: Where's the movement? It's there. So I go
over to this desk and open it.

02:26:49.349 --> 02:26:53.964
TRAVIS: Right. As you do, the Rug of Smothering--

02:26:53.964 --> 02:26:55.986
LIAM and SAM: Yes!

02:26:55.986 --> 02:27:04.147
TRAVIS: --with its false appearance grapples
you from behind and will attempt to smother you.

02:27:04.147 --> 02:27:05.906
LIAM: What does it have to do?

02:27:05.906 --> 02:27:13.412
SAM: I'm trying to figure out, did Travis find
these things and put them in the room or did he

02:27:13.412 --> 02:27:16.795
think, what can I put in a room?

02:27:16.795 --> 02:27:18.594
TRAVIS: I just went to the Monster Manual.

02:27:18.594 --> 02:27:21.427
SAM: I'll go through the Monster Manual and be
like, ooh, a rug! And put that in there. What else

02:27:21.427 --> 02:27:23.368
can I put in a room... ooh! A plant!

02:27:23.368 --> 02:27:31.267
TRAVIS: It is a 21 to hit and you take-- that does
hit.

02:27:31.267 --> 02:27:33.856
LIAM: I believe so.

02:27:33.856 --> 02:27:39.409
TRAVIS: You take 11 points of bludgeoning damage
and you are restrained, blinded and at risk of

02:27:39.409 --> 02:27:40.539
suffocating.

02:27:40.539 --> 02:27:41.643
LIAM: Sweet.

02:27:41.643 --> 02:27:43.719
LAURA: You're going to die from a rug!

02:27:43.719 --> 02:27:48.366
TRAVIS: You cannot gesture, make a sound or
anything in your tiny little room.

02:27:48.366 --> 02:27:51.135
TALIESIN: You're getting murdered by the touring
company of Aladdin.

02:27:51.135 --> 02:27:53.513
TRAVIS: Percy, what would you like to do?

02:27:53.513 --> 02:27:58.861
TALIESIN: Can I hear any of this? Is there
anything--

02:27:58.861 --> 02:28:05.803
TRAVIS: You are in solid stone rooms. You are at
risk of suffocating.

02:28:05.803 --> 02:28:07.507
LIAM: (muffled) Can I say Jenga? Jenga!

02:28:07.507 --> 02:28:11.309
LAURA: But you can't reach your earring, so nobody
can hear you saying it.

02:28:11.309 --> 02:28:12.742
TRAVIS: Yeah, we didn't-- we have to do that.

02:28:12.742 --> 02:28:14.072
LIAM: We have to do this?

02:28:14.072 --> 02:28:18.169
LAURA: Yeah, we have to touch our earring in order
to-- it's kind of the thing.

02:28:18.169 --> 02:28:20.595
TRAVIS: You've got to tickle your earlobe when you
talk.

02:28:20.595 --> 02:28:24.742
LIAM: I will use a game to experience death. It
will be enlightening.

02:28:24.742 --> 02:28:28.717
TRAVIS: Yeah. I mean, you never know when it might
come for you out here.

02:28:28.717 --> 02:28:34.151
TALIESIN: Is there anything else? Is there
anything in the ceiling? Is there anything on the floor?

02:28:34.151 --> 02:28:37.704
TRAVIS: There is a hatch above you in the ceiling.
A plate metal hatch.

02:28:37.704 --> 02:28:42.418
TALIESIN: I'm going to back up to the same corner
that Vex is in and I'm going to take a couple

02:28:42.418 --> 02:28:44.520
shots at the hatch, see what happens.

02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:49.963
TRAVIS: You back up. Roll to-- no, fuck that. It's
a hatch. You fire. How many shots would you like

02:28:49.963 --> 02:28:51.017
to fire?

02:28:51.017 --> 02:28:53.296
TALIESIN: Three in quick succession.

02:28:53.296 --> 02:28:58.325
TRAVIS: Brilliant. You fire off three quick
shots-- no need to roll-- they all ricochet off of this--

02:28:58.325 --> 02:29:00.175
TALIESIN: Two of them crit!

02:29:00.175 --> 02:29:04.036
TRAVIS: Oh. All right. That makes a difference.

02:29:04.036 --> 02:29:10.242
TALIESIN: It does! I just rolled six times and
four times have been critical.

02:29:10.242 --> 02:29:15.214
TRAVIS: You fire your first shot and while it
ricochets off, it starts bouncing around the stone

02:29:15.214 --> 02:29:23.216
room dangerously close to yourself. You are so
calm and cool, and with that debonair Percy charm,

02:29:23.216 --> 02:29:28.954
you merely make a slight adjustment with your gun,
and you fire. The door-- it hits and you see it

02:29:28.954 --> 02:29:36.004
start to crack and start to loosen from the wall.
A small piece of the hatch is now showing some

02:29:36.004 --> 02:29:39.965
visible line of sight between it and the ceiling.

02:29:39.965 --> 02:29:45.261
TALIESIN: I think I'm starting to open this hatch
which is in my room. Can everybody hear me?

02:29:45.261 --> 02:29:49.026
LAURA: Can we hear him? Can I hear him?

02:29:49.026 --> 02:29:50.324
TRAVIS: You can hear him.

02:29:50.324 --> 02:29:51.492
LAURA: I can hear you, darling.

02:29:51.492 --> 02:29:52.956
SAM: But I can't talk.

02:29:52.956 --> 02:29:55.065
LAURA: I can hear you, darling. What's up?

02:29:55.065 --> 02:29:57.940
TALIESIN: Oh, I've got a hatch in my room and I've
got it a bit open at this point.

02:29:57.940 --> 02:29:59.535
LAURA: I've got a hatch too!

02:29:59.535 --> 02:30:01.494
TALIESIN: I wonder if there's five hatches?

02:30:01.494 --> 02:30:05.446
LAURA: Scanlan, Vax, look up. Do you see a hatch?

02:30:09.113 --> 02:30:10.576
TALIESIN: Be rude. That's fine.

02:30:10.576 --> 02:30:12.271
LAURA: Dicks.

02:30:12.271 --> 02:30:13.817
TALIESIN: So rude.

02:30:13.817 --> 02:30:18.839
SAM: We're not going to mega-game.

02:30:18.839 --> 02:30:23.123
LAURA: Should I come in your room and look at your
hatch, or should I continue to look at my hatch?

02:30:23.194 --> 02:30:25.095
LIAM: Mega Man is for cowards.

02:30:25.095 --> 02:30:28.267
TALIESIN: My hatch is a bit-- Have you
loosened your hatch yet?

02:30:28.267 --> 02:30:31.525
LAURA: Let me give it a try.

02:30:31.525 --> 02:30:40.447
TRAVIS: While you're talking, the mimic in
Scanlan's room will again try to smother you with

02:30:40.447 --> 02:30:42.339
a bite attack while it's grappling you.

02:30:42.339 --> 02:30:43.842
SAM: Sure.

02:30:43.842 --> 02:30:51.755
TRAVIS: Hold on, I've got to add. Five seconds.
Where's the music?!

02:30:51.755 --> 02:30:54.459
SAM: Servants, come on, now!

02:30:54.459 --> 02:30:56.122
LAURA: They got so tired.

02:30:56.122 --> 02:30:57.462
TALIESIN: Union break.

02:30:57.462 --> 02:30:59.575
LIAM: Grog, you're breaking the verisimilitude.

02:30:59.575 --> 02:31:01.296
LAURA: There it is. The back.

02:31:01.296 --> 02:31:05.672
TRAVIS: With advantage, that is 24 points of
damage.

02:31:05.672 --> 02:31:10.124
TALIESIN: How are you doing right now, Scanlan?
Not that I know. I shouldn't know.

02:31:10.124 --> 02:31:11.835
TRAVIS: Where are you at?

02:31:11.835 --> 02:31:13.549
TALIESIN: Is that a yummy sound?

02:31:13.549 --> 02:31:20.277
TRAVIS: Vax, your rug of smothering also begins to
crush you again.

02:31:20.277 --> 02:31:23.843
LIAM: This is not my first time.

02:31:23.843 --> 02:31:25.779
LAURA: Being smothered by a rug?

02:31:25.779 --> 02:31:28.163
LIAM: Having my breathing snuffed out.

02:31:28.163 --> 02:31:34.950
TRAVIS: Actually, before this happens, roll a
strength check.

02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:40.123
LIAM: A strength check? All right. I roll the
round die. I'll roll the Grog one. That's a one.

02:31:40.123 --> 02:31:41.904
I'm going to use another luck.

02:31:41.904 --> 02:31:43.327
LAURA: That's your last one.

02:31:43.327 --> 02:31:47.711
LIAM: It's not. It's my third one, a-hole. I have four.

02:31:47.711 --> 02:31:53.859
TRAVIS: You don't need to roll your modifier.
That's enough. You break free, and the rug starts

02:31:53.859 --> 02:31:58.123
to shimmy down across your legs. It's not
smothering you anymore, but it's still keeping you

02:31:58.123 --> 02:32:01.513
in place. Your arms are free, and you can
breathe.

02:32:01.513 --> 02:32:06.116
LIAM: The most important thing to me right now is
to point out that my strength is 14, which is

02:32:06.116 --> 02:32:11.632
slightly above average, which is very different
than your shit-ass seven, with a modifier of

02:32:11.632 --> 02:32:13.163
negative two.

02:32:13.163 --> 02:32:18.873
TRAVIS: While it is around your legs, it will bite
you for 21 points of damage. Not bite you, crush

02:32:18.873 --> 02:32:20.193
you. Sorry.

02:32:20.193 --> 02:32:25.292
LIAM: Does it roll to hit, or do I make a dex
save?

02:32:25.292 --> 02:32:29.679
TRAVIS: It's still grappling you, so you're in the
same place, still, but you can breathe and you can

02:32:29.679 --> 02:32:31.354
move, but it's still around your legs.

02:32:31.354 --> 02:32:33.702
LIAM: What did I just roll to do, though, Grog? I
don't understand.

02:32:33.702 --> 02:32:36.190
TRAVIS: So you could breathe and not suffocate.

02:32:36.190 --> 02:32:41.522
LIAM: That's very important. Is it important for
me, though? I haven't breathed very much at all--

02:32:41.522 --> 02:32:44.281
TRAVIS: You, technically? No. Not important for
you.

02:32:44.281 --> 02:32:46.011
LIAM: I would have been fine in there.

02:32:46.011 --> 02:32:49.086
TRAVIS: But your singing career would have been
limited.

02:32:49.086 --> 02:32:51.367
LIAM: Okay, so I take a bunch of damage, right?

02:32:51.367 --> 02:32:52.619
TRAVIS: 21 points of damage.

02:32:52.619 --> 02:32:53.989
LIAM: 21 points of damage, okay.

02:32:53.989 --> 02:32:56.578
TRAVIS: And you are now free.

02:32:56.578 --> 02:32:58.988
LIAM: Hey, I have 69 hit points. Nice.

02:32:58.988 --> 02:33:03.150
LAURA: Can I fly up and look at the hatch up
close?

02:33:03.150 --> 02:33:05.739
TRAVIS: Sure. You take out the broom, you fly up
to the hatch--

02:33:05.739 --> 02:33:07.450
LAURA: Also, can Trinket come in the room?

02:33:07.450 --> 02:33:08.955
TRAVIS: Sure. Trinket comes in.

02:33:08.955 --> 02:33:10.549
LAURA: He's going to stand in the other corner.

02:33:10.549 --> 02:33:12.287
LIAM: Are the hatches bars?

02:33:12.287 --> 02:33:16.774
TRAVIS: Plate metal. A square piece of plate
metal.

02:33:16.774 --> 02:33:20.098
LAURA: What can I see up close? Anything?

02:33:20.098 --> 02:33:25.314
TRAVIS: It is a plate metal hatch. A sheet of
metal with rivets, and it's solid.

02:33:25.314 --> 02:33:26.902
LAURA: Can I push on it?

02:33:26.902 --> 02:33:28.112
TRAVIS: You cannot.

02:33:28.112 --> 02:33:29.959
LAURA: Can I get my fingers in and pull on it?

02:33:29.959 --> 02:33:31.969
TRAVIS: No.

02:33:31.969 --> 02:33:35.150
LAURA: Can I stick a dagger in at the edges and
try to pry it open?

02:33:35.150 --> 02:33:40.715
TRAVIS: No. You could try, and I could make you
roll a bunch of times. It wouldn't work.

02:33:40.715 --> 02:33:45.850
LAURA: Well, he rolled two criticals, and
something happened. What if I roll a critical?

02:33:45.850 --> 02:33:47.969
TRAVIS: Roll a dice.

02:33:47.969 --> 02:33:51.194
LAURA: Ooh, so close. It was a 19.

02:33:51.194 --> 02:33:55.014
TRAVIS: You pull on it, and you hear (metal
creaking).

02:33:55.014 --> 02:33:57.093
LIAM: There's a witch behind it.

02:33:57.093 --> 02:33:59.734
TALIESIN: I've got mine kind of open, if you want
to come here.

02:33:59.734 --> 02:34:02.651
TRAVIS: Scanlan, roll a strength saving throw.

02:34:02.651 --> 02:34:05.525
SAM: 13.

02:34:05.525 --> 02:34:10.875
TRAVIS: 13? That's actually exactly what you
needed. You manage to get your arms free, and you

02:34:10.875 --> 02:34:16.419
break free of the mimic, but it is still coming at
you. Now you see teeth coming out of this chest, a

02:34:16.419 --> 02:34:18.461
giant pseudopod tongue.

02:34:18.461 --> 02:34:23.200
SAM: Should I escape, or should I kill it? I don't
know.

02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:25.295
LAURA: Kill it!

02:34:25.295 --> 02:34:30.147
SAM: I will step back, and I will Lightning Bolt
it at level five!

02:34:30.147 --> 02:34:33.493
TRAVIS: Go for it.

02:34:33.493 --> 02:34:35.300
TALIESIN: What does any of that mean?

02:34:35.300 --> 02:34:39.737
SAM: I will Lightning Bolt it at level five!

02:34:39.737 --> 02:34:45.797
TALIESIN: It was like you started to say four and
said five. It turned into an accent.

02:34:45.797 --> 02:34:48.048
LIAM: I thought you said you played GURPS in grade
school.

02:34:48.048 --> 02:34:53.334
SAM: He has to make a dex save. I think it's a dex
save.

02:34:53.334 --> 02:34:54.947
TRAVIS: Of what?

02:34:54.947 --> 02:35:01.330
SAM: Oh boy. It's probably either 15, or it's my
spell DC. If it's my spell DC, I wouldn't have the

02:35:01.330 --> 02:35:03.416
cone up, so it would be 20.

02:35:03.416 --> 02:35:05.189
TRAVIS: That is a 13.

02:35:05.189 --> 02:35:10.346
SAM: Well, either way, he fails, so he gets 10d6
of damage.

02:35:10.346 --> 02:35:13.916
LAURA: That's a lot of lightning damage.

02:35:13.916 --> 02:35:16.754
LIAM: Sounds like a lot of something, of
something.

02:35:16.754 --> 02:35:20.012
SAM: How many is that? That's nine.

02:35:20.012 --> 02:35:25.531
LIAM: These scarves were a wonderful purchase for
the group. They are so cozy.

02:35:25.531 --> 02:35:27.504
LAURA: So warm.

02:35:27.504 --> 02:35:29.726
LIAM: We need them in Vasselheim.

02:35:29.726 --> 02:35:36.302
SAM: 39. Oh! And one more. 43.

02:35:36.302 --> 02:35:45.124
TRAVIS: With that one lightning, you see the mimic
shake, tense up, quake, and burst apart into

02:35:45.124 --> 02:35:51.081
purple goo. It splatters little green noodles all
over the floor where it was, and you see in its

02:35:51.081 --> 02:35:54.466
muck a little vial where it was.

02:35:54.466 --> 02:35:56.914
SAM: I inspect the vial.

02:35:56.914 --> 02:35:58.472
TRAVIS: It's a greater healing potion.

02:35:58.472 --> 02:35:59.757
SAM: I chug it.

02:35:59.757 --> 02:36:01.015
TRAVIS: Yeah, you chug it. Go for it.

02:36:01.015 --> 02:36:02.674
SAM: What is that, four something?

02:36:02.674 --> 02:36:04.328
LAURA: 4d4.

02:36:04.328 --> 02:36:11.819
SAM: Everyone, all the rooms have horrible
creatures in them! Be careful!

02:36:11.819 --> 02:36:14.221
LAURA: Mine didn't have any creatures in it.

02:36:14.221 --> 02:36:16.590
TALIESIN: Mine had a mildly irritated house
plant.

02:36:16.590 --> 02:36:18.468
LIAM: Fuck the lot of you!

02:36:18.468 --> 02:36:27.514
TRAVIS: That's it? Not "help?" While he's healing,
Vax, what would you like to do?

02:36:27.514 --> 02:36:34.663
LIAM: My hands are free? I throw Whisper 15 feet
out the door and bamf to where it strikes on the ground.

02:36:34.663 --> 02:36:37.711
TRAVIS: Nice. You pop outside the door.

02:36:37.711 --> 02:36:42.500
LIAM: Yeah, and then I will turn now-- it's up to
you, Grog--

02:36:42.500 --> 02:36:47.990
TRAVIS: Unleash Armageddon. Do what you do.

02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:50.273
LIAM: I'm going to use two daggers, if I can.

02:36:50.273 --> 02:36:52.977
TRAVIS: Now's the time, mate.

02:36:52.977 --> 02:36:58.904
LIAM: Wait. I'm going to use my Vow of Enmity on
the rug, and then I'm going to attack.

02:36:58.904 --> 02:37:01.115
TALIESIN: Are you going to cut a rug, then?

02:37:01.115 --> 02:37:05.691
TRAVIS: You get 150 XP.

02:37:05.691 --> 02:37:08.889
TALIESIN: 150 XP for the terrible pun. Huzzah!

02:37:08.889 --> 02:37:10.478
SAM: How many do you have?

02:37:10.478 --> 02:37:12.043
LIAM: I have zero points!

02:37:12.043 --> 02:37:13.686
TRAVIS: I am susceptible to puns.

02:37:13.686 --> 02:37:14.828
TALIESIN: Good to know.

02:37:14.828 --> 02:37:16.395
SAM: That is good to know, actually.

02:37:16.395 --> 02:37:25.217
LIAM: (giggles) 31, and because my Vow of Enmity
on this rug is in fucking effect, I get sneak

02:37:25.217 --> 02:37:32.814
attack damage, so that is two, plus eight is ten,
and then we add some of that. 12, and these guys

02:37:32.814 --> 02:37:34.942
go, as well. (counting)

02:37:34.942 --> 02:37:37.709
LAURA: I like that you can sneak attack the rug.
It doesn't know you're there!

02:37:37.709 --> 02:37:40.402
TRAVIS: Right. It's a rug.

02:37:40.402 --> 02:37:43.723
LIAM: 39 points of damage on the fucking Persian
carpet.

02:37:43.723 --> 02:37:53.276
TRAVIS: And with that, the rug quakes and falls
flat, deflated. A regular rug now. Slightly

02:37:53.276 --> 02:37:55.172
unraveled at the corners.

02:37:55.172 --> 02:38:00.462
LIAM: Hardwood floors are much fucking better.
Fuck you. And I'm going to walk in and check out

02:38:00.462 --> 02:38:01.712
that chest.

02:38:01.712 --> 02:38:05.725
TRAVIS: Indeed. You hear, all of a sudden, as you
check out the chest-- indeed, there is a greater

02:38:05.725 --> 02:38:14.138
healing potion. As Vax terminates the rug, you
hear a click in all of the latches above your heads.

02:38:14.138 --> 02:38:20.569
LAURA: Oh no. Am I still up at the latch? Am I
still right at the latch?

02:38:20.569 --> 02:38:21.755
TRAVIS: Are you?

02:38:21.755 --> 02:38:23.859
LAURA: Well, I said I was. I never stopped being
there.

02:38:23.859 --> 02:38:27.693
TRAVIS: Yeah. There you are, just flying right
next to it.

02:38:27.693 --> 02:38:29.471
TALIESIN: I'll take another shot at mine.

02:38:29.471 --> 02:38:35.074
TRAVIS: You fire, and the latch flips open at the
top.

02:38:35.074 --> 02:38:37.660
TALIESIN: Hello?

02:38:37.660 --> 02:38:40.834
LAURA: Can I push on mine?

02:38:40.834 --> 02:38:42.879
TALIESIN: Hello?

02:38:42.879 --> 02:38:50.655
TRAVIS: No response. You may push on yours. It
lifts. It comes right back down, but lifts.

02:38:50.655 --> 02:38:52.810
LAURA: My latch is open. My hatch!

02:38:52.810 --> 02:38:54.229
TALIESIN: Mine, as well.

02:38:54.229 --> 02:38:56.201
LAURA: Scanlan, Vax?

02:38:56.201 --> 02:38:58.057
SAM: Seems like mine's open, too.

02:38:58.057 --> 02:38:59.530
LAURA: Should we go in?

02:38:59.530 --> 02:39:02.353
TALIESIN: I'm going to activate my spider boots
and head on up there.

02:39:02.353 --> 02:39:07.876
TRAVIS: Excellent. You walk up the side of the
wall, doing the little shimmy that Percy does so

02:39:07.876 --> 02:39:13.457
well in his bedroom when he's getting dressed in
Whitestone. He pops through the hatch. Do you go

02:39:13.457 --> 02:39:14.685
up, as well?

02:39:14.685 --> 02:39:16.507
LAURA: I do. I bamf Trinket into my necklace,
first.

02:39:16.507 --> 02:39:19.579
TRAVIS: Trinket goes in the necklace. You go up
through the hatch. What about you two fellows?

02:39:19.579 --> 02:39:24.047
SAM: I'm going to turn into a dung beetle and fly
straight up.

02:39:24.047 --> 02:39:28.527
TRAVIS: Right, yeah. Into this tiny little dung
beetle, you fly. You hit the hatch.

02:39:28.527 --> 02:39:30.137
SAM: It's solid?!

02:39:30.137 --> 02:39:33.812
TRAVIS: There was a click. It didn't fucking
open.

02:39:33.812 --> 02:39:35.863
SAM: I thought it had bars.

02:39:35.863 --> 02:39:38.796
TRAVIS: (popping)

02:39:38.796 --> 02:39:40.978
SAM: I thought it had bars!

02:39:40.978 --> 02:39:45.474
TRAVIS: You take five points of stupid damage.

02:39:45.474 --> 02:39:50.381
SAM: Then I'm back out as a gnome, and I guess I'm
falling.

02:39:50.381 --> 02:39:54.303
TRAVIS: Yeah, you fall a whole ten, 11 feet.

02:39:54.303 --> 02:39:55.909
SAM: More damage?

02:39:55.909 --> 02:39:58.302
TRAVIS: You take two points of gnome damage.

02:39:58.302 --> 02:40:02.091
SAM: All right. Shit.

02:40:02.091 --> 02:40:08.572
TRAVIS: Vax, what are you doing? Wings? Yeah, the
fucking wings come out, even though you're on the

02:40:08.572 --> 02:40:12.685
ground, and you walk, very badass, back through
the room.

02:40:12.685 --> 02:40:22.694
LIAM: I'll grab the potion. I will use them to
easily hop the 12 feet up, and then I will pull

02:40:22.694 --> 02:40:30.851
the wings in. Press the wings into the back of me,
and slide and crawl my way up this tunnel.

02:40:30.851 --> 02:40:33.151
TRAVIS: Brilliant. You pop up through the hatch.

02:40:33.151 --> 02:40:34.885
LAURA: Is it another room, or is it a tunnel?

02:40:34.885 --> 02:40:36.084
TRAVIS: We'll shortly see.

02:40:36.084 --> 02:40:37.756
LIAM: My wings are silky smooth.

02:40:37.756 --> 02:40:43.175
TRAVIS: Scanlan, what are you doing? You come to,
and you're like, "Fuck. Why did I turn into a dung

02:40:43.175 --> 02:40:45.132
"beetle? The latch was still closed."

02:40:45.132 --> 02:40:48.668
SAM: All right. Now I will turn into a monkey.

02:40:48.668 --> 02:40:50.548
TRAVIS: A monkey. What kind of monkey?

02:40:50.548 --> 02:40:51.986
SAM: A gibbon.

02:40:51.986 --> 02:40:53.700
TRAVIS: A small gibbon. Okay.

02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:55.755
SAM: Big enough that it has muscles.

02:40:55.755 --> 02:40:57.068
TRAVIS: We'll find out.

02:40:57.068 --> 02:40:59.767
SAM: I crawl up to the top and try to push open
the latch.

02:40:59.767 --> 02:41:06.761
TRAVIS: You get up there, and as you start to
push, roll a strength check with disadvantage.

02:41:06.761 --> 02:41:09.720
SAM: Natural 20.

02:41:09.720 --> 02:41:11.612
SAM and TALIESIN: Natural 20!

02:41:11.612 --> 02:41:14.415
ALL: Whoa!

02:41:14.415 --> 02:41:20.889
TRAVIS: This very large metal latch flies open.

02:41:20.889 --> 02:41:25.905
SAM: I shit on the latch and keep going.

02:41:25.905 --> 02:41:32.332
TRAVIS: You pop up through the latch. As Scanlan
makes his gibbon way through the latch, all of you

02:41:32.332 --> 02:41:42.851
find yourself in a new space, and all of the
latches slam closed. You find yourself in a new space.

02:41:42.851 --> 02:41:45.851
LAURA: Grog, you are so artistic!

02:41:45.851 --> 02:41:52.963
TRAVIS: Aren't I? It resembles the shape of the
previous map.

02:41:52.963 --> 02:41:55.805
TALIESIN: That resembles the shape of the previous
map.

02:41:55.805 --> 02:41:58.326
SAM: That's a circle, just like the last one.

02:41:58.326 --> 02:42:11.296
TRAVIS: You find yourselves with a flat floor. You
have a visual line of sight with all of the

02:42:11.296 --> 02:42:12.773
members of your team.

02:42:12.773 --> 02:42:14.025
LAURA: We can see each other?

02:42:14.025 --> 02:42:15.219
TRAVIS: You can see each other.

02:42:15.219 --> 02:42:17.862
SAM: Except for one. Who would have been the
star?

02:42:17.862 --> 02:42:28.025
TRAVIS: There's some sort of body laying above the
area of the room with the door that was already

02:42:28.025 --> 02:42:29.119
open.

02:42:29.119 --> 02:42:30.871
TALIESIN: I'm going to examine it.

02:42:30.871 --> 02:42:33.253
SAM: Wait, are there walls separating us?

02:42:33.253 --> 02:42:41.048
TRAVIS: You are on what seems to be the roof of
the room previous, and there's a giant tower right

02:42:41.048 --> 02:42:50.519
in the middle of all of this. At the top of this
tower, not to size, there's a large platform dome

02:42:50.519 --> 02:42:54.152
area up here with light radiating out of it.

02:42:54.152 --> 02:42:59.982
LIAM: Guys, from my point of view, I can see
Fletcher's Mill emblazoned at the base of the

02:42:59.982 --> 02:43:02.070
tower. I just imagined it!

02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:06.752
LAURA: Is that Sharpie at the bottom of that
pepper mill?

02:43:06.752 --> 02:43:08.411
TRAVIS: No. Nope.

02:43:08.411 --> 02:43:12.474
SAM: Did he ruin your designer pepper mill?

02:43:12.474 --> 02:43:16.541
LAURA: Travis Willingham!

02:43:16.541 --> 02:43:18.579
TRAVIS: It was a wedding gift. Who cares?

02:43:18.579 --> 02:43:21.880
(laughter)

02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:31.104
TRAVIS: So you see your comrades up atop the roof
of this platform and some sort of corpse or

02:43:31.104 --> 02:43:33.076
motionless body.

02:43:33.076 --> 02:43:34.769
LAURA: Can we walk over to it?

02:43:34.769 --> 02:43:35.880
TRAVIS: You can try.

02:43:35.880 --> 02:43:37.692
LAURA: I want to walk over to it and kick it.

02:43:37.692 --> 02:43:44.524
TRAVIS: You start to walk over, and as you reach
this border, you are struck by an invisible field,

02:43:44.524 --> 02:43:48.300
and you take eight points of force damage.

02:43:48.300 --> 02:43:49.625
LAURA: Oh no, eight points.

02:43:49.625 --> 02:43:52.913
LIAM: I wanted to pickpocket Scanlan so I could
start Robbing Gibbons.

02:43:52.913 --> 02:43:58.358
TRAVIS: As you hit the wall, there is a shimmer of
energy that quickly dissipates in between your

02:43:58.358 --> 02:44:00.337
section and someone else's.

02:44:00.337 --> 02:44:05.631
LAURA: Is it gone now, or is it still there?

02:44:05.631 --> 02:44:08.136
TRAVIS: It shimmers and disappears.

02:44:08.136 --> 02:44:10.380
LAURA and TALIESIN: It's probably still there.

02:44:10.380 --> 02:44:13.412
TALIESIN: I want to try stepping up the column.

02:44:13.412 --> 02:44:22.032
TRAVIS: As you move towards the column, you see on
this tower, it is made of stone, but there seem

02:44:22.032 --> 02:44:24.964
to be built-in footholds and handholds.

02:44:24.964 --> 02:44:31.891
TALIESIN: I ignore them. I'm not going to put my
hands or feet in any of those holes.

02:44:31.891 --> 02:44:36.531
TRAVIS: It appears the same energy covers that
tower, and you take eight points of force damage.

02:44:36.531 --> 02:44:49.220
As Percy touches and activates the shield for a
second time, the lights around you dim, and you

02:44:49.220 --> 02:44:53.363
feel heat around each of you individually.

02:44:53.363 --> 02:45:04.280
You are struck with horror as form begins
to take shape in front of each of you. Behind

02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:17.273
Percy, all of a sudden, the form of a mind flayer
begins to take shape. Behind Vax, a red-skinned,

02:45:17.273 --> 02:45:27.528
armor-clad, winged demon appears. A cambion, right
in front of our rogue.

02:45:27.528 --> 02:45:30.840
SAM: You looked these up last night, you had to
look these up.

02:45:30.840 --> 02:45:36.627
TRAVIS: In front of Vex, a pony.

02:45:36.627 --> 02:45:39.196
LAURA: Oh, a pony, yay!

02:45:39.196 --> 02:45:41.486
TALIESIN: Don't touch it, it's evil.

02:45:41.486 --> 02:45:45.179
TRAVIS: And in front of Scanlan materializes, to
his horror,

02:45:45.179 --> 02:45:46.727
a fucking T-rex.

02:45:46.727 --> 02:46:01.536
(laughter)

02:46:01.536 --> 02:46:08.089
TRAVIS: A giant roar echoes across the land.

02:46:08.089 --> 02:46:09.938
LIAM: Over a gibbon!

02:46:09.938 --> 02:46:15.480
TALIESIN: I have been waiting for gibbon versus
T-rex my entire life!

02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:25.663
TRAVIS: A T-rex versus a gibbon. You all stare in
horror at perfectly picked enemies for you. I need

02:46:25.663 --> 02:46:29.456
you all to roll initiative.

02:46:29.456 --> 02:46:39.632
SAM: I rolled one. 20, 20, one, my last three
rolls.

02:46:39.632 --> 02:46:40.925
TALIESIN: 23.

02:46:40.925 --> 02:46:45.132
TRAVIS: 23, that's the Percy I know. Vex?

02:46:45.132 --> 02:46:46.536
LAURA: 22.

02:46:46.536 --> 02:46:47.799
TRAVIS: Vax?

02:46:47.799 --> 02:46:48.895
LIAM: A big 12.

02:46:48.895 --> 02:46:56.292
TALIESIN: That potion was 4d4?

02:46:56.292 --> 02:47:00.811
SAM: I did 4d4 plus four, is that right for a
greater healing potion?

02:47:00.811 --> 02:47:02.029
LIAM: It is.

02:47:02.029 --> 02:47:20.516
TRAVIS: Okay. The cambion turns and faces Vax at
the top of the initiative, and he will unleash his

02:47:20.516 --> 02:47:26.797
Fire Ray at you. 26 to hit.

02:47:26.797 --> 02:47:28.735
LIAM: Yeah, that'll hit.

02:47:28.735 --> 02:47:35.940
TRAVIS: This is hard. You take 12 points of fire
damage.

02:47:35.940 --> 02:47:40.726
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to pretend like the
Deathwalker's Ward is set to fire.

02:47:40.726 --> 02:47:42.237
TRAVIS: Sure.

02:47:42.237 --> 02:47:44.342
LIAM: So halve that.

02:47:44.342 --> 02:47:52.961
TRAVIS: So six, nice. And he will make a ranged
spear attack against you. It's only 19.

02:47:52.961 --> 02:47:55.273
LIAM: Does not hit. Sidestep.

02:47:55.273 --> 02:48:02.523
TRAVIS: The deer shoots-- The deer? The deer
bounds past-- The spear misses you, as you are

02:48:02.523 --> 02:48:08.598
presented with this new foe, and with a bonus
action he will take flight. But I'm not breaking

02:48:08.598 --> 02:48:16.987
out those fucking stands, so let's just say he takes
flight. Next in the initiative order, this pony

02:48:16.987 --> 02:48:21.942
takes a few steps towards you and (snorting).

02:48:21.942 --> 02:48:25.527
LAURA: No, don't attack me, pony!

02:48:25.527 --> 02:48:27.784
TRAVIS: And turns into a mystical unicorn.

02:48:27.784 --> 02:48:34.891
(laughter)

02:48:34.891 --> 02:48:37.880
TRAVIS: A large, celestial, lawfully good enemy!

02:48:37.880 --> 02:48:40.736
TALIESIN: You're going to have to kill it.

02:48:40.736 --> 02:48:43.242
LAURA: No, I'm not going to, it's so cute!

02:48:43.242 --> 02:48:46.500
TALIESIN: We have to murder and eat our opponents,
it's the only way out.

02:48:46.500 --> 02:48:50.501
TRAVIS: And it will cast Entangle on you.

02:48:50.501 --> 02:48:54.167
LAURA: What do I have to roll to avoid it?

02:48:54.167 --> 02:49:01.919
TRAVIS: You have to make a DC 18. It is a dex.

02:49:01.919 --> 02:49:11.776
LAURA: Okay. 17.

02:49:11.776 --> 02:49:17.405
TRAVIS: You feel all of a sudden these vines come
out of the stonework and it holds you where you

02:49:17.405 --> 02:49:28.318
are. And it will charge straight at you using its
magical horn. 22.

02:49:28.318 --> 02:49:39.001
LAURA: It hits. But I have uncanny dodge and
evade, which one do I use?

02:49:39.001 --> 02:49:42.839
LIAM: Evasion for a dex save, uncanny dodge can
halve one melee attack per round.

02:49:42.839 --> 02:49:49.726
TRAVIS: It does 12 points of piercing damage and I
need to you roll a strength saving throw or be

02:49:49.726 --> 02:49:52.640
knocked prone by its mystical power.

02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:56.580
LAURA: A strength saving throw? If I use evasion
does it still have to do that?

02:49:56.580 --> 02:49:58.539
TRAVIS: I have no idea.

02:49:58.539 --> 02:50:01.507
LIAM: Evasion only triggers if you have to make a
dex save.

02:50:01.507 --> 02:50:06.779
LAURA: That was so fucking close. 25.

02:50:06.779 --> 02:50:12.253
TRAVIS: You're not knocked prone, you sidestep it,
but you only take the damage. Percy, you are up.

02:50:12.253 --> 02:50:19.310
TALIESIN: I am going to throw Manners at this
creature.

02:50:19.310 --> 02:50:20.671
TRAVIS: Brilliant.

02:50:20.671 --> 02:50:22.704
LIAM: Is it a JRPG, you're throwing mana?

02:50:22.704 --> 02:50:41.652
TALIESIN: Manners, not mana. Let's see, that's a
ranged attack roll, that's 30 to hit.

02:50:41.652 --> 02:50:43.447
TRAVIS: That will hit.

02:50:43.447 --> 02:50:57.132
TALIESIN: My target is restrained. On its turn, it
can make a DC 20 strength check to try and get

02:50:57.132 --> 02:50:59.219
out. At the moment, it's restrained.

02:50:59.219 --> 02:51:03.157
TRAVIS: A natural one, he is restrained.

02:51:03.157 --> 02:51:08.878
TALIESIN: And while he's restrained, I'm going to
walk over and I'm going to burn an action surge.

02:51:08.878 --> 02:51:13.058
I'm going to stab him with my sword three times.
And since he's restrained I think I get a bonus on

02:51:13.058 --> 02:51:14.469
that, don't I?

02:51:14.469 --> 02:51:18.149
TRAVIS: You're so nasty. Melee attacks.

02:51:18.149 --> 02:51:26.502
TALIESIN: Let's not waste bullets on anything like
this. I'll take three swipes. Is it an auto-crit

02:51:26.502 --> 02:51:28.158
if they're restrained?

02:51:28.158 --> 02:51:31.893
TRAVIS: Yeah. No, you have advantage, I think.

02:51:31.893 --> 02:51:37.455
TALIESIN: I have advantage, okay. So I'll go with
that. I don't actually remember.

02:51:37.455 --> 02:51:40.942
TRAVIS: If I overheard the guy at the tavern
right.

02:51:40.942 --> 02:51:50.063
TALIESIN: That's one normal hit. 25 to hit.

02:51:50.063 --> 02:51:53.939
TRAVIS: Yeah. He has a very low AC.

02:51:53.939 --> 02:51:56.647
TALIESIN: And the last one is 24 to hit.

02:51:56.647 --> 02:51:57.983
TRAVIS: All three hit.

02:51:57.983 --> 02:52:20.215
TALIESIN: So that's 36 points of piercing damage.
And I'm going to breathe deep. I may use my bonus

02:52:20.215 --> 02:52:21.964
action to take a healing potion.

02:52:21.964 --> 02:52:25.346
TRAVIS: Please do. All right, next up: Vex.

02:52:25.346 --> 02:52:32.379
LAURA: That's me! Are my hands restrained or is it
just my feet?

02:52:32.379 --> 02:52:39.364
TRAVIS: Just your feet, you cannot move. Let me
check, because I'm sure I'm getting this totally right.

02:52:39.364 --> 02:52:41.480
LIAM: What are you checking, Grog? Do you have a
book or something for this?

02:52:41.480 --> 02:52:49.068
TRAVIS: No, I carve notes into the thingy. Yeah,
you just can't move.

02:52:49.068 --> 02:52:59.085
LAURA: I can't move my feet? Okay. I'm going to
cast Grasping Vine. And I'm going to try to hook

02:52:59.085 --> 02:53:05.499
a vine around the unicorn and pull him back
towards the corner right here.

02:53:05.499 --> 02:53:08.211
LIAM: Oh, you killed him!

02:53:08.211 --> 02:53:09.615
LAURA: He dies.

02:53:09.615 --> 02:53:17.960
TRAVIS: He is top heavy. Let's go with option
number two. None of these guys want to stay up!

02:53:17.960 --> 02:53:19.995
You're so drunk.

02:53:19.995 --> 02:53:22.522
SAM: Go home, unicorn.

02:53:22.522 --> 02:53:29.700
TRAVIS: Unicorn will use one of his legendary--

02:53:29.700 --> 02:53:31.914
LAURA: He's got legendary actions?

02:53:31.914 --> 02:53:35.083
TRAVIS: Yep, and he resists the Grasping Vine.

02:53:35.083 --> 02:53:38.893
LAURA: What a fucking dick!

02:53:38.893 --> 02:53:42.299
TRAVIS: I know, unicorns, right? Fuck me.

02:53:42.299 --> 02:53:49.840
LAURA: Fine, well, Grasping Vine is a bonus action.
I don't think he can resist it, but whatever.

02:53:49.840 --> 02:53:53.932
TRAVIS: Are you a unicorn? Then how do you know?

02:53:53.932 --> 02:53:56.851
LAURA: It's not like it's a spell effect, he has
to make a dexterity save.

02:53:56.851 --> 02:53:58.706
TRAVIS: Are you arguing with the BM?

02:53:58.706 --> 02:54:04.107
LAURA: Nope, not at all. Can I shoot him? No, I
don't want to shoot him! Can I talk to him?

02:54:04.107 --> 02:54:05.511
TRAVIS: Sure.

02:54:05.511 --> 02:54:11.348
LAURA: I want to say: Unicorn, why are you
attacking me? I don't want to fight you.

02:54:11.348 --> 02:54:13.382
TRAVIS: What language are you speaking in?

02:54:13.382 --> 02:54:16.776
LAURA: I'm speaking in Unicorn.

02:54:16.776 --> 02:54:19.056
SAM: You already cast Speak With Animals today.

02:54:19.056 --> 02:54:21.009
LIAM: Celestial for unicorn.

02:54:21.009 --> 02:54:22.726
LAURA: I'm speaking in Unicorn.

02:54:22.726 --> 02:54:24.103
LIAM: And your six seconds are up.

02:54:24.103 --> 02:54:25.505
TRAVIS: That's not a language.

02:54:25.505 --> 02:54:27.895
LAURA: Grog, how do you know it's not a language?

02:54:27.895 --> 02:54:34.143
TRAVIS: I know these things. It's what I do. I
drink and I know things.

02:54:34.143 --> 02:54:38.717
LAURA: All right, then I'm going to speak in
normal, and I'm speaking Elvish! I feel like

02:54:38.717 --> 02:54:40.505
unicorns might be able to understand.

02:54:40.505 --> 02:54:44.276
TRAVIS: Well, the unicorn speaks Celestial,
Elvish, Sylvan, and telepathy, but because you

02:54:44.276 --> 02:54:47.463
just spoke in Common--

02:54:47.463 --> 02:54:49.473
LAURA: I said Elvish.

02:54:49.473 --> 02:54:53.001
TRAVIS: Good thing it understands you-- It has
telepathy!

02:54:53.001 --> 02:54:57.505
LAURA: So I say: Why are you fighting me? Why? I
don't want to fight you. I don't want to hurt you.

02:54:57.505 --> 02:54:58.776
I love you.

02:54:58.776 --> 02:55:01.724
TRAVIS: And he's like, "I am a unicorn. There can
only be one."

02:55:01.724 --> 02:55:05.525
(laughter)

02:55:05.525 --> 02:55:07.297
LAURA: That's my whole turn.

02:55:07.297 --> 02:55:09.256
LIAM: You know that was like 87 seconds.

02:55:09.256 --> 02:55:11.098
TRAVIS: The T-rex will take its turn!

02:55:11.098 --> 02:55:12.385
SAM: Bring it.

02:55:12.385 --> 02:55:20.702
TRAVIS: It is going to run towards you with a
multi-attack on your carrion form. It's going to

02:55:20.702 --> 02:55:25.348
make a bite attack first. That is an 18.

02:55:25.348 --> 02:55:26.477
SAM: That hits.

02:55:26.477 --> 02:55:30.747
TRAVIS: Yeah! Oh god. Okay.

02:55:30.747 --> 02:55:38.586
TALIESIN: So much math.

02:55:38.586 --> 02:55:48.106
TRAVIS: That is 36 points of damage. Does that
knock you out of your carrion form?

02:55:48.106 --> 02:55:50.515
SAM: Oh yeah, I'm no longer a monkey.

02:55:50.515 --> 02:55:56.011
TRAVIS: It's a bite, so you are in the jaws of a
T-rex, Scanlan.

02:55:56.011 --> 02:55:59.388
TALIESIN: (squawks) I don't think they make that
noise, but--

02:55:59.388 --> 02:56:01.091
LAURA: I don't think so. It sounded kind of like a
bird.

02:56:01.091 --> 02:56:02.582
TALIESIN: They are very bird-like.

02:56:02.582 --> 02:56:08.906
TRAVIS: And we are going to make a tail attack
against you. Oh, it's only 18 to hit.

02:56:08.906 --> 02:56:13.691
SAM: Yeah, that hits. Scanlan has an AC of 14.

02:56:13.691 --> 02:56:15.624
LAURA: What? That's so low.

02:56:15.624 --> 02:56:21.678
TRAVIS: That is 28 points of damage as it smacks
you with its tail.

02:56:21.678 --> 02:56:23.969
SAM: Great.

02:56:23.969 --> 02:56:25.850
LAURA: How are you doing, Scanlan?

02:56:25.850 --> 02:56:28.620
SAM: I'm still double digits.

02:56:28.620 --> 02:56:32.000
TRAVIS: Next up: Vax.

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:39.356
LIAM: All right. I regain one hit point as a
revenant. So that's going to make all the

02:56:39.356 --> 02:56:48.944
difference. I use my action to cast a level one
druid spell, Faerie Fire, on this flying fucker.

02:56:48.944 --> 02:56:53.584
It has to make a dex save versus my DC of 16.

02:56:53.584 --> 02:56:55.017
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:56:55.017 --> 02:56:56.705
LAURA: You really caught on.

02:56:56.705 --> 02:56:58.063
LIAM: I did.

02:56:58.063 --> 02:56:59.450
TRAVIS: That's an eight.

02:56:59.450 --> 02:57:05.992
LIAM: Poof! Lit up like a disco ball, and I now
have advantage on the attack against it so I can

02:57:05.992 --> 02:57:08.460
fucking sneak attack, which is going to be
clutch.

02:57:08.460 --> 02:57:13.493
TRAVIS: Indeed. It stands there, not thinking much
of you and a burst of fiery light surrounds his

02:57:13.493 --> 02:57:17.184
form. All of a sudden, you are very sure about
where to hit and how.

02:57:17.184 --> 02:57:24.427
LIAM: Right in front of me, and I will use my
bonus action to throw a fucking dagger. Oh dear,

02:57:24.427 --> 02:57:26.314
that is a 23 to hit.

02:57:26.314 --> 02:57:27.524
TRAVIS: 23 hits.

02:57:27.524 --> 02:57:46.872
LIAM: Yes, it does, and it gets (counting), plus
these guys. Jeez, that was a shitty roll. 33 and

02:57:46.872 --> 02:58:00.762
I'm going to dump my other level two spell slot
for Divine Smite. 48 total from Whisper.

02:58:00.833 --> 02:58:11.413
TRAVIS: 48 massive points of damage. Shit. Damn.
Cool. Sam. Scan! Lan. You're up!

02:58:11.413 --> 02:58:21.911
SAM: (muttering) Challenge rating. Am I in its--

02:58:21.911 --> 02:58:28.157
TRAVIS: No, it smacked you with its tail away. It
bit you, and then it was like (spits out), and hit

02:58:28.157 --> 02:58:29.767
you with its ass extension.

02:58:29.767 --> 02:58:34.882
SAM: All right, I'm contractually required to turn
into a triceratops.

02:58:34.882 --> 02:58:39.247
TRAVIS: I mean, have you done that before?

02:58:39.247 --> 02:58:40.500
SAM: Yeah.

02:58:40.500 --> 02:58:46.155
TRAVIS: Great. I should have that, but I didn't
plan that far ahead. So we're going to turn you

02:58:46.155 --> 02:58:47.494
into this--

02:58:47.494 --> 02:58:49.013
SAM: This unicorn.

02:58:49.013 --> 02:58:53.991
TRAVIS: This giant werebear looking fucking thing.
There you go.

02:58:53.991 --> 02:59:09.590
SAM: Oh, before I did that, I Healing Worded
myself for like ten points of health there, as a

02:59:09.590 --> 02:59:16.356
bonus. And now I am a triceratops and I will use
the rest of my turn to back into the corner.

02:59:16.356 --> 02:59:19.044
TRAVIS: Okay, that's your turn.

02:59:19.044 --> 02:59:20.811
SAM: Yeah, that's it.

02:59:20.811 --> 02:59:36.897
TRAVIS: Okay, the cambion is up and he's going to
multi-attack against you. 16 will miss. 24?

02:59:36.897 --> 02:59:39.922
LIAM: It will, but I'm going to use my last luck.
Roll again.

02:59:39.922 --> 02:59:43.293
TRAVIS: Oh. 18?

02:59:43.293 --> 02:59:44.570
LIAM: Does not hit.

02:59:44.570 --> 02:59:50.417
TRAVIS: Nice. He has one last-- 25.

02:59:50.417 --> 02:59:51.939
LIAM: Does hit.

02:59:51.939 --> 02:59:54.486
TRAVIS: Great, you only get hit once though, which
is nice.

02:59:54.486 --> 02:59:55.679
LIAM: What's it hit me with?

02:59:55.679 --> 02:59:57.548
TRAVIS: He hits you with this fiery spear.

02:59:57.548 --> 02:59:58.739
LIAM: All right.

02:59:58.739 --> 03:00:08.207
TRAVIS: That is 16 points of fire and piercing
damage.

03:00:08.207 --> 03:00:14.632
LIAM: Fire, so that'll be halved to eight? And
then it might be four, I'm going to look something

03:00:14.632 --> 03:00:21.475
up really fucking quick. Uncanny dodge. I'm going
to halve that down to four.

03:00:21.475 --> 03:00:28.038
TRAVIS: So four points of damage. There you go.
Brilliant. He's going to use his movement to--

03:00:28.038 --> 03:00:35.715
Just right in your face! "Look how big my wings
are in comparison to yours!" It is now the

03:00:35.715 --> 03:00:39.518
unicorn's turn. The unicorn rushes forward--

03:00:39.518 --> 03:00:43.890
LIAM: Have you ever seen this unicorn before?

03:00:43.890 --> 03:00:45.390
LAURA: No, I have no idea--

03:00:45.390 --> 03:00:51.209
TRAVIS: He is going to make two hooved attacks
against you and a horn stabby in your face.

03:00:51.209 --> 03:00:53.166
TALIESIN: Friendship is magic.

03:00:53.166 --> 03:00:55.453
TRAVIS: That's true. 16?

03:00:55.453 --> 03:00:56.747
LAURA: Doesn't hit.

03:00:56.747 --> 03:00:59.733
TRAVIS: 25?

03:00:59.733 --> 03:01:00.817
LAURA: That hits.

03:01:00.817 --> 03:01:04.410
TRAVIS: And the horn. That hits.

03:01:04.410 --> 03:01:05.537
LAURA: How do you know?

03:01:05.537 --> 03:01:20.595
TRAVIS: Because it's 27. That is 19 points of
piercing and bludgeoning damage, respectively.

03:01:20.595 --> 03:01:23.121
TALIESIN: Could be worse.

03:01:23.121 --> 03:01:35.299
TRAVIS: And he will stay where he is. He will try
to stand up again. For the brave-- (gasps) He's a

03:01:35.299 --> 03:01:37.638
show pony. Percy, you're up.

03:01:37.638 --> 03:01:40.218
TALIESIN: I actually should be right in the face
of this terrible--

03:01:40.218 --> 03:01:42.549
TRAVIS: Oh yes, sorry. You did stabby the fuck out
of him.

03:01:42.549 --> 03:01:48.730
TALIESIN: I'm just going to keep stabby, stabby,
stabby. With advantage. So, stabby. Yes, that

03:01:48.730 --> 03:01:58.412
hits. Stabby. Ooh, that's nice. That's crit-- Oh,
it's not crit because it's not a gun, it's just a

03:01:58.412 --> 03:02:06.330
sword. And that's really hard to read, because
that's Scanlan's dice. My lowest number is 28 to hit.

03:02:06.330 --> 03:02:09.373
TRAVIS: They all hit, very hard.

03:02:09.373 --> 03:02:13.762
LAURA: It is really pretty though, Scanlan.

03:02:13.762 --> 03:02:16.485
SAM: Thank you.

03:02:16.485 --> 03:02:22.032
LIAM: The triceratops diddles his iPhone in the
corner.

03:02:22.032 --> 03:02:24.068
SAM: I'm looking up all my stats.

03:02:24.068 --> 03:02:25.642
TALIESIN: 36 points of damage.

03:02:25.642 --> 03:02:28.893
SAM: I haven't been a triceratops in over a year.

03:02:28.893 --> 03:02:32.835
TALIESIN: Is he still just doing that, just
there?

03:02:32.835 --> 03:02:40.468
TRAVIS: Yep. He looks like he is quite surprised
as to why he's there in the first fucking place,

03:02:40.468 --> 03:02:41.848
and that you are--

03:02:41.848 --> 03:02:45.559
TALIESIN: I'm just going to add a little bit of
extra damage on there with my Hex. So let's just

03:02:45.559 --> 03:02:55.333
add five points of lightning damage as well, for
fun. 14 points of lightning damage on top of that.

03:02:55.333 --> 03:03:09.131
TRAVIS: He will react to that extra salvo,
(snarls) with all his stupid things.

03:03:09.131 --> 03:03:10.639
TALIESIN: Try and mental me or anything?

03:03:10.639 --> 03:03:17.131
TRAVIS: He is going to use Mind Blast right at
you. I need you to roll an intelligence saving throw.

03:03:17.131 --> 03:03:20.868
TALIESIN: All right. I can do that.

03:03:20.868 --> 03:03:27.380
TRAVIS: Wasn't it you that he tried to suck the
brain out of before?

03:03:27.380 --> 03:03:29.020
LAURA: That was Scanlan.

03:03:29.020 --> 03:03:31.427
TALIESIN: Intelligence saving throw, that's 23.

03:03:31.427 --> 03:03:40.182
TRAVIS: Yeah, that doesn't happen at all. Cool.
Good deal. He is going to make a simple melee

03:03:40.182 --> 03:03:41.495
attack against you.

03:03:41.495 --> 03:03:43.132
TALIESIN: Oh no, he's not. He's restrained.

03:03:43.132 --> 03:03:48.090
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, he's restrained. He's just, like,
baffled by how dominant you are in this whole thing.

03:03:48.090 --> 03:03:51.050
TALIESIN: I'm just going to keep stabbing him in
the face over and over again.

03:03:51.050 --> 03:03:56.491
TRAVIS: Yeah, he really wishes he wasn't here
right now. He's not sure who he pissed off. Vex,

03:03:56.491 --> 03:03:57.465
you're up.

03:03:57.465 --> 03:04:00.298
LAURA: Yeah! Am I still entangled?

03:04:00.298 --> 03:04:03.123
TRAVIS: Oh, make a strength saving throw.

03:04:03.123 --> 03:04:15.016
LAURA: Saving throw? That would be 19.

03:04:15.016 --> 03:04:19.913
TRAVIS: You break free of the vines and they
wither and die in the ground.

03:04:19.913 --> 03:04:25.626
LAURA: I'm going to use my bonus action to use the
Grasping Vine again and try to wrap right around

03:04:25.626 --> 03:04:27.286
his leg and yank him back.

03:04:27.286 --> 03:04:31.201
TRAVIS: Great. I roll, don't I? What is it?

03:04:31.201 --> 03:04:35.954
LAURA: That is a dex save.

03:04:35.954 --> 03:04:38.044
TRAVIS: That's a seven.

03:04:38.044 --> 03:04:41.752
LAURA: Oh, then he's restrained. Or he's pulled
back at least.

03:04:41.752 --> 03:04:43.341
TRAVIS: He's pulled back on his heinies.

03:04:43.341 --> 03:04:53.060
LAURA: Yeah! So it falls over, it's all right. And
then I'm going to cast Speak with Animals,

03:04:53.060 --> 03:04:55.810
although I don't need to because he already--

03:04:55.810 --> 03:04:57.509
TRAVIS: Speaks more languages than you do.

03:04:57.509 --> 03:05:03.089
LAURA: And I'm going to say: You're a very good
creature. I know you're lawful. What are you doing

03:05:03.089 --> 03:05:05.092
fighting me? I'm good too!

03:05:05.092 --> 03:05:07.094
TRAVIS: (hums)

03:05:07.094 --> 03:05:11.194
LAURA: Anything? No response?

03:05:11.194 --> 03:05:12.991
TRAVIS: I mean, on his turn he might.

03:05:12.991 --> 03:05:19.656
LAURA: Okay, just know that I don't want to attack
you, I'd rather just ride around on you, because

03:05:19.656 --> 03:05:21.226
you seem really beautiful.

03:05:21.226 --> 03:05:24.393
SAM: One more time, just not trying to kill you.

03:05:24.393 --> 03:05:30.103
LAURA: And then for my movement, I'm going to hop
on my broom and fly up in the air.

03:05:30.103 --> 03:05:31.674
TRAVIS: How high?

03:05:31.674 --> 03:05:38.875
LAURA: Not quite to the top of the tower. How high
does the tower go?

03:05:38.875 --> 03:05:41.290
TRAVIS: Looks like it's 120 feet to the top of the
tower.

03:05:41.290 --> 03:05:42.772
LAURA: I'm going to just go up 40 feet.

03:05:42.772 --> 03:05:48.754
TRAVIS: That's good. At 40 feet you are hovering
up at the top of the tower, and you hear somewhere

03:05:48.754 --> 03:05:53.463
above you a buzz of energy. I don't know how many
this is.

03:05:53.463 --> 03:05:55.253
LAURA: Ooh, you have them!

03:05:55.253 --> 03:05:56.877
TRAVIS: Well they're over here, so fuck it.

03:05:56.877 --> 03:05:59.893
LAURA: Wait, maybe flip it over.

03:05:59.893 --> 03:06:02.985
SAM: You got it wrong.

03:06:02.985 --> 03:06:07.950
LAURA: That's it!

03:06:07.950 --> 03:06:17.510
TRAVIS: How's this shit work? What was wrong with
the first way I was doing this? Here, you're

03:06:17.510 --> 03:06:20.701
flying 40 feet in the air. Sam, make that work.

03:06:20.701 --> 03:06:24.080
SAM: We are missing a piece.

03:06:24.080 --> 03:06:27.589
TRAVIS: Oh, here, there's a base over here!

03:06:27.589 --> 03:06:29.091
LIAM: There you go!

03:06:29.091 --> 03:06:36.855
TRAVIS: I'm sure there's a certain number of
things you've got to count, but-- That's really high.

03:06:36.855 --> 03:06:45.913
LAURA: Yeah (counting). I'm about ten feet higher
than I should be.

03:06:45.913 --> 03:06:55.445
TRAVIS: You hear a buzz of energy above you, but
you seem to be fine. Scanlan. No, Vax. No, T-rex!

03:06:55.445 --> 03:07:10.955
T-rex charges forward towards the triceratops,
nurturing its ancient rivalry with such a foe. It

03:07:10.955 --> 03:07:17.115
will make a multi-attack. It will bitch slap you
with its tail. 25.

03:07:17.115 --> 03:07:18.261
SAM: That hits.

03:07:18.261 --> 03:07:32.338
TRAVIS: For 23 points of bludgeoning damage. And
it will make a bite attack against you. 21.

03:07:32.338 --> 03:07:33.620
SAM: Hits.

03:07:33.620 --> 03:07:45.384
TRAVIS: 4d12 plus seven. I suck at subtraction
math. Adding, I'm okay. That is 37 points--

03:07:45.384 --> 03:07:47.077
SAM: Whoa!

03:07:47.077 --> 03:07:50.764
TRAVIS: Of piercing damage.

03:07:50.764 --> 03:07:52.609
SAM: Great.

03:07:52.609 --> 03:07:55.929
TRAVIS: Good. Oh, you're a triceratops, you're all
sorts of muscled up.

03:07:55.929 --> 03:07:57.456
SAM: A little bit.

03:07:57.456 --> 03:08:02.141
TRAVIS: Nice. Vax, it is your turn. He's just
going to be like (grunts).

03:08:02.141 --> 03:08:13.238
LIAM: I'm going to use a level one spell slot and
cast Faerie Fire again on the illithid by Freddie.

03:08:13.238 --> 03:08:16.805
So it has to save versus a 16.

03:08:16.805 --> 03:08:22.396
TRAVIS: As you go to cast Faerie Fire, you see it
disperse along the barrier wall between your

03:08:22.396 --> 03:08:24.599
section and his. Unaffected.

03:08:24.599 --> 03:08:30.345
LIAM: I thought that would affect physical, not
magical. All right, well then I will fuck this guy

03:08:30.345 --> 03:08:35.768
up in front of me then. That's a 23?

03:08:35.768 --> 03:08:37.219
TRAVIS: 23 hits.

03:08:37.219 --> 03:08:57.409
LIAM: 19, that's good. 36 total. And I'll just
stick it out right in front of him.

03:08:57.409 --> 03:09:02.849
TRAVIS: He's looking very rough. Scanlan, your
turn.

03:09:02.849 --> 03:09:13.486
SAM: Without leaving his attack range, and thus
not provoking an attack of opportunity I hope, I'm

03:09:13.486 --> 03:09:29.673
going to charge for his leg and hit it with a gore
attack. So I'm going to move down the line and

03:09:29.673 --> 03:09:36.435
attack his leg. Rolling a two. Plus nine.

03:09:36.435 --> 03:09:41.227
TRAVIS: A two! The triceratops runs forward. No
effect.

03:09:41.227 --> 03:09:43.022
SAM: End of turn.

03:09:43.022 --> 03:09:46.708
TRAVIS: (laughs) That's what the triceratops has
got?

03:09:46.708 --> 03:09:54.458
LIAM: That was Sam as Scanlan as Scanlan as T-rex
as bear.

03:09:54.458 --> 03:10:03.464
TRAVIS: Okay, the cambion getting its ass handed
to it by Vax will look him in the face, and it

03:10:03.464 --> 03:10:08.833
will cast Command at-- let's say fourth level.

03:10:08.833 --> 03:10:18.240
LIAM: What, to fly into the wall over and over
again?

03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:20.390
TRAVIS: You need to roll a constitution saving
throw.

03:10:20.390 --> 03:10:25.184
LIAM: Okay, Colville, it's up to you. Not good.
Eight-- 15.

03:10:25.184 --> 03:10:31.424
TRAVIS: 15, not good. He commands you to grovel in
front of him, and all of a sudden you feel this

03:10:31.424 --> 03:10:37.421
overwhelming urge. You drop to your knees and you
lay prone right in front of him, not able to get up.

03:10:37.421 --> 03:10:43.995
LIAM: I don't understand this game! The rules
don't make sense! Can I have some XBs, please? Can

03:10:43.995 --> 03:10:46.229
I have some XBs?

03:10:46.229 --> 03:10:54.171
TRAVIS: I'm a fan of puns, you get ten XPs. He
will have advantage on his flaming spear attack

03:10:54.171 --> 03:10:55.604
against you.

03:10:55.604 --> 03:10:59.363
TRAVIS: That's a natural 20.

03:10:59.363 --> 03:11:02.463
LIAM: Sure.

03:11:02.463 --> 03:11:04.857
TRAVIS: It was advantage.

03:11:04.857 --> 03:11:10.476
LIAM: Sure. What a good idea, to grovel.

03:11:10.476 --> 03:11:17.406
TRAVIS: 39 points of piercing and fire damage,
which is halved.

03:11:17.406 --> 03:11:19.065
LIAM: But which part of it?

03:11:19.065 --> 03:11:20.221
TRAVIS: Well, I don't know.

03:11:20.221 --> 03:11:22.993
LIAM: Just give me a number, Grog. You're the
mathematician.

03:11:22.993 --> 03:11:27.386
TRAVIS: Let's call it 20, down to 20. Let's call
it 19 points.

03:11:27.386 --> 03:11:32.070
LIAM: Okay, I would've got back a hit point,
because I'm a revenant. So that's 41, so I'm

03:11:32.070 --> 03:11:33.286
sitting pretty.

03:11:33.286 --> 03:11:41.687
TRAVIS: Good deal. There you are. Next up is the
unicorn. Having heard your humanitarian pleas for

03:11:41.687 --> 03:11:42.779
peace--

03:11:42.779 --> 03:11:47.595
LAURA: He's also stuck in that position because of
the Grasping Vine.

03:11:47.595 --> 03:11:56.977
TRAVIS: Casts Levitate. Kidding, he doesn't have
Levitate. Why did I move him? He's there. The

03:11:56.977 --> 03:12:05.614
unicorn who's stuck, which I totally forgot about,
will use... Ooh! Yes! Teleport! He casts

03:12:05.614 --> 03:12:06.648
Teleport.

03:12:06.648 --> 03:12:07.954
LAURA: Where? Where does he go?

03:12:07.954 --> 03:12:12.075
TRAVIS: Once a day he magically teleports himself
within five feet of where he was.

03:12:12.075 --> 03:12:14.762
LIAM: Within five feet of where he was?

03:12:14.762 --> 03:12:15.956
TRAVIS: Poof!

03:12:15.956 --> 03:12:20.563
(laughter)

03:12:20.563 --> 03:12:24.216
SAM: Wait, five feet Teleport? What spell is
that?!

03:12:24.216 --> 03:12:28.838
TRAVIS: No, any willing creatures within five
feet, but that's what I saw first, so that's the

03:12:28.838 --> 03:12:35.539
rule. It can go up to a mile away, but it's five
feet.

03:12:35.539 --> 03:12:41.122
(laughter)

03:12:41.122 --> 03:12:47.066
TRAVIS: It will use its horn of rainbow attack
against you.

03:12:47.066 --> 03:12:48.462
LAURA: Oh no.

03:12:48.462 --> 03:12:53.145
TRAVIS: That is a 23.

03:12:53.145 --> 03:12:55.044
LAURA: Ugh, it fucking hits me.

03:12:55.044 --> 03:13:07.520
TRAVIS: That is 22 points of damage. That ends its
turn. Percy, you are up.

03:13:07.520 --> 03:13:09.745
TALIESIN: I'm just going to stab him three more
times.

03:13:09.745 --> 03:13:12.439
LAURA: Do need to make a dexterity save to see if
I stay on my broom?

03:13:12.439 --> 03:13:15.149
TRAVIS: Nope. You take it like a champ.

03:13:15.149 --> 03:13:20.951
TALIESIN: Three more attacks. That's 21 to hit.

03:13:20.951 --> 03:13:28.306
TRAVIS: That hits. If those two hit, just roll
damage for those two.

03:13:28.306 --> 03:13:30.073
TALIESIN: They all hit.

03:13:30.073 --> 03:13:31.847
TRAVIS: He's looking pretty gross.

03:13:31.847 --> 03:13:43.873
TALIESIN: Oh, that's terrible. 28 points of
piercing damage.

03:13:43.873 --> 03:13:49.880
TRAVIS: With the sword, right? As you take your
silvered sword and repeatedly jam it into his

03:13:49.880 --> 03:13:56.748
general thorax and face, repeatedly-- Tentacles
falling off like freshly cut sushi, he just falls

03:13:56.748 --> 03:14:05.074
backwards, guts spewing like Stephen King's The
Thing. He is toast.

03:14:05.074 --> 03:14:07.173
LIAM: (as Clarota) Go fuck yourself.

03:14:07.173 --> 03:14:13.082
TALIESIN: For my bonus action I'm going to retract
my little Manners ball, and then I'm going to

03:14:13.082 --> 03:14:16.535
walk, and attempt to tap the wall to
see if it's still standing.

03:14:16.535 --> 03:14:23.101
TRAVIS: As you walk to the wall, you notice that
there seems to be no force field on your side of

03:14:23.101 --> 03:14:24.656
the tower.

03:14:24.656 --> 03:14:27.738
TALIESIN: I'm actually in the far corner, put me
behind the unicorn, please.

03:14:27.738 --> 03:14:34.319
TRAVIS: Oh, you tapped this one. I got you. You seem
to see no effect.

03:14:34.319 --> 03:14:36.651
TALIESIN: All right, good. That's the end of my
turn.

03:14:36.651 --> 03:14:38.268
TRAVIS: Vex.

03:14:38.268 --> 03:14:48.885
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to take the greater healing
potion. Which is 4d4.

03:14:48.885 --> 03:14:52.335
TRAVIS: You better attack this fucking unicorn.

03:14:52.335 --> 03:15:07.149
LAURA: Whoa, that's a really good 14 points plus
four, right? So 18 points healed. And then I'm

03:15:07.149 --> 03:15:20.958
going to fly over the unicorn, and drop down,
landing on its back! And I'm going to use my Rope

03:15:20.958 --> 03:15:27.343
of Entanglement to make like a harness thing and
hold on to the fucking unicorn like a fucking

03:15:27.343 --> 03:15:28.584
rodeo.

03:15:28.584 --> 03:15:29.986
SAM: Why aren't you killing the unicorn?

03:15:29.986 --> 03:15:31.629
LAURA: Because he's lawful good.

03:15:31.629 --> 03:15:34.225
TRAVIS: I need you to make an acrobatics check.

03:15:34.225 --> 03:15:42.694
LAURA: Okay. That would be a one. (laughs)

03:15:42.694 --> 03:15:46.705
SAM: Please tell me she falls on the horn.

03:15:46.705 --> 03:15:48.788
TALIESIN: This is everything I've ever wanted.

03:15:48.788 --> 03:15:54.969
TRAVIS: You plummet, falling toward its head. And at
the last moment, having been affected by your

03:15:54.969 --> 03:16:05.531
wonderful message, it looks up. And you find
yourself impaled, gored on its horn! It even

03:16:05.531 --> 03:16:07.239
jumps up and spins!

03:16:07.239 --> 03:16:09.882
SAM: Like Free Willy!

03:16:09.882 --> 03:16:12.376
LAURA: I deserve that.

03:16:12.376 --> 03:16:20.998
TRAVIS: You will take, jeez, 18 points of piercing
damage.

03:16:20.998 --> 03:16:25.132
LAURA: Right back down to where I was before I
healed. But thank god I healed!

03:16:25.132 --> 03:16:32.195
TRAVIS: You just manage to roll off the horn,
laying on your back across its mane. Not riding

03:16:32.195 --> 03:16:34.109
it, but just there for the moment.

03:16:34.109 --> 03:16:35.889
LAURA: Am I on my back or on my stomach?

03:16:35.889 --> 03:16:43.175
TRAVIS: You're on your back, in a very
uncomfortable arched position. The T-rex turns!

03:16:43.175 --> 03:16:49.248
Tail whip!

03:16:49.248 --> 03:16:50.755
SAM: (screech)

03:16:50.755 --> 03:17:01.696
TRAVIS: That is 26 points of bludgeoning damage,
and the bite attack against you--

03:17:01.696 --> 03:17:09.773
SAM: Wait, you have to roll to hit.

03:17:09.773 --> 03:17:13.968
TRAVIS: Oh shit, fuck. Oh, 17.

03:17:13.968 --> 03:17:15.013
SAM: Hits.

03:17:15.013 --> 03:17:17.585
TRAVIS: Okay, that is 39 points of piercing
damage.

03:17:17.585 --> 03:17:20.563
SAM: Okay, back to Scanlan.

03:17:20.563 --> 03:17:28.703
TRAVIS: Oh yeah? Vax, you are prone and up.

03:17:28.703 --> 03:17:35.190
LIAM: I will use half my movement to stand. And
then I will use the other half of my movement,

03:17:35.190 --> 03:17:40.593
which winged is 30 feet, and fly up to this
asshole. And I will use a bonus action to down

03:17:40.593 --> 03:17:55.910
that potion that I grabbed, which is 4d4 plus
four. So that's (counting) 14. And then I will

03:17:55.910 --> 03:18:04.261
stab this asshole in the asshole. That is a 33 to
hit.

03:18:04.261 --> 03:18:05.955
TRAVIS: An asshole for an asshole. That hits.

03:18:05.955 --> 03:18:16.610
LIAM: All right, here we go. (counting) And then
here come all the d6s.

03:18:16.610 --> 03:18:18.756
TRAVIS: Jesus.

03:18:18.756 --> 03:18:26.194
LIAM: (counting) 44, and I will dump--

03:18:26.194 --> 03:18:30.191
TRAVIS: You're very good at adding all those dice
for someone who's never played this game before.

03:18:30.191 --> 03:18:34.952
LIAM: I'm good at math, I'm not good at whatever
the fuck this game is. This is the best game,

03:18:34.952 --> 03:18:38.935
though. So it's in the high 40s, you made me lose
track. I'm going to say 49.

03:18:38.935 --> 03:18:43.023
TRAVIS: I'll take it. Oh god. Any other attacks
after that?

03:18:43.023 --> 03:18:49.039
LIAM: Yeah. Not much. That is 26 to hit.

03:18:49.039 --> 03:18:50.197
TRAVIS: Yep, hits.

03:18:50.197 --> 03:18:59.141
LIAM: Seven, and I will dump my last spell slot
in. 17.

03:18:59.141 --> 03:19:03.904
TRAVIS: And with that, the dagger pierces through
the armor. And you hear (snarls) as a spurt of

03:19:03.904 --> 03:19:13.503
black blood comes out of its mouth. Its wings fall
to the side. And it's like, "How did you..." And

03:19:13.503 --> 03:19:15.118
falls over dead.

03:19:15.118 --> 03:19:18.769
LIAM: Slow dance down to the ground.

03:19:18.769 --> 03:19:23.505
SAM: Meanwhile, me and Laura still haven't dealt
any damage to ours at all.

03:19:23.505 --> 03:19:25.457
TRAVIS: Scanlan, you're up.

03:19:25.457 --> 03:19:27.921
TALIESIN: There's a Tyrannosaurus rex and a
unicorn that still need to be dealt with.

03:19:27.921 --> 03:19:29.451
SAM: Put Scanlan back on there.

03:19:29.451 --> 03:19:31.783
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! Where is Scanlan?

03:19:31.783 --> 03:19:35.488
LIAM: Very quickly, covered in gore, Freddie and
Vax nod.

03:19:35.488 --> 03:19:37.654
TALIESIN: Quite proper.

03:19:37.654 --> 03:19:51.681
SAM: As a bonus action, I will 2nd-level Healing
Word myself. Need to do that. That's seven plus

03:19:51.681 --> 03:20:03.949
six. Oh, that's 13 points, that helped. And I will
just step back a little, not a lot. Then I will

03:20:03.949 --> 03:20:08.859
cast Reverse Gravity and send him skyward.

03:20:08.859 --> 03:20:16.105
(laughter)

03:20:16.105 --> 03:20:20.771
SAM: He has to make a dexterity saving throw
against 22. But he's dexterous, it could work.

03:20:20.771 --> 03:20:23.696
TRAVIS: Six.

03:20:23.696 --> 03:20:29.742
SAM: Does it hurt him to hit the top?

03:20:29.742 --> 03:20:35.625
TRAVIS: Yes. In fact, you see ripples of
energy just going out. And you start to smell

03:20:35.625 --> 03:20:41.963
fried alligator. He falls 50 feet.

03:20:41.963 --> 03:20:47.393
LIAM: (sings Jurassic Park theme)

03:20:47.393 --> 03:20:50.350
TRAVIS: 25. Damn it, he's barely-- (groans)

03:20:50.350 --> 03:20:56.334
SAM: He would actually technically not fall. He
just stays there.

03:20:56.334 --> 03:21:01.228
TRAVIS: Oh really? So each round he'll take more
of that energy damage. Fair enough.

03:21:01.228 --> 03:21:05.225
SAM: He stays there for a minute. So that's ten
rounds of damage.

03:21:05.225 --> 03:21:16.746
TRAVIS: The unicorn, feeling this upside-down
half-elf on his back, shakes you off.

03:21:16.746 --> 03:21:22.447
LAURA: No! Can I try to hang on? I want to try to
hang on to his hair!

03:21:22.447 --> 03:21:26.800
TRAVIS: Sure. Roll an athletics check with
disadvantage.

03:21:26.800 --> 03:21:31.287
LAURA: Well, I don't need to roll the other one,
because it's a one.

03:21:31.287 --> 03:21:39.237
TRAVIS: Well, there you go. You fall-- Yeah, there
you go.

03:21:39.237 --> 03:21:44.572
(laughter)

03:21:44.572 --> 03:21:47.095
LAURA: Oh no, am I getting eaten by the unicorn?

03:21:47.095 --> 03:22:00.649
TRAVIS: The unicorn comes over, and begins to
smell the fallen half-elf. "You showed me great

03:22:00.649 --> 03:22:10.121
"respect, Vex'ahlia. Your kindness will live
throughout the ages. All the unicorns will be told

03:22:10.121 --> 03:22:18.966
"of your mercy." And it kneels down and touches its
horn to the ground, and all of the enemies

03:22:18.966 --> 03:22:20.978
disappear.

03:22:20.978 --> 03:22:22.857
LIAM: Well earned.

03:22:22.857 --> 03:22:26.093
LAURA: Thank you! It worked!

03:22:26.093 --> 03:22:31.955
TRAVIS: You also see a similar shimmer disappear
from the barriers, and you can see the stones on

03:22:31.955 --> 03:22:34.037
the tower even more clearly than ever before.

03:22:34.037 --> 03:22:35.646
SAM: What do they look like?

03:22:35.646 --> 03:22:37.240
TRAVIS: Like stones.

03:22:37.240 --> 03:22:40.342
LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself at
3rd-level.

03:22:40.342 --> 03:22:43.944
TALIESIN: I'm going to go take a look at that body
that was sitting in the--

03:22:43.944 --> 03:22:53.298
TRAVIS: Yes. Percy, you get over, and you see what
seems to be some sort of humanoid figure. Roll a

03:22:53.298 --> 03:22:54.719
perception check.

03:22:54.719 --> 03:23:01.879
TALIESIN: That's not great. 14.

03:23:01.879 --> 03:23:14.649
TRAVIS: You see tattered clothes, but you also see
slashes and big gashes and flesh peeling back.

03:23:14.649 --> 03:23:21.568
There's also bits of hair, multicolored, and big
gashes in the floor. There's tons of gore, but it

03:23:21.568 --> 03:23:26.045
does appear as if whatever this was was mauled by
something, almost.

03:23:26.045 --> 03:23:28.941
TALIESIN: How big is this body, approximately?

03:23:28.941 --> 03:23:31.303
TRAVIS: Very close to your own. Very similar.

03:23:31.303 --> 03:23:35.723
SAM: Any clothing that we recognize?

03:23:35.723 --> 03:23:37.622
TALIESIN: I don't know, take a look.

03:23:37.622 --> 03:23:39.148
SAM: I'll come look.

03:23:39.148 --> 03:23:41.136
LIAM: My wounds are starting to heal up somewhat.

03:23:41.136 --> 03:23:42.558
TRAVIS: Yeah, because they do that.

03:23:42.558 --> 03:23:43.897
SAM: Seven perception.

03:23:43.897 --> 03:23:55.471
TRAVIS: You come over and you're like, those are
fucking clothes. Old brigade navy and, you know,

03:23:55.471 --> 03:23:58.915
all sorts of stuff that you kind of recognize but
not really.

03:23:58.915 --> 03:24:03.443
LAURA: Can I bamf Trinket out and see if he
recognizes the scent?

03:24:03.443 --> 03:24:10.254
TRAVIS: Yeah, you bamf Trinket out of the
necklace, and he's like, whoa, unicorn piss! And

03:24:10.254 --> 03:24:14.911
he goes right back in the necklace because I don't
know where he went-- There he is. He's out.

03:24:14.911 --> 03:24:23.888
LAURA: Can he smell for perception on the body to
see if he recognizes who it is? Yeah, he has smell

03:24:23.888 --> 03:24:25.077
perception.

03:24:25.077 --> 03:24:27.941
TRAVIS: Yeah, roll the whatever that is. He's got
that?

03:24:27.941 --> 03:24:29.334
LAURA: He's got advantage on smell perception.

03:24:29.334 --> 03:24:34.766
TRAVIS: Yeah, go for it, advantage style. What?

03:24:34.766 --> 03:24:35.847
LAURA: Does that count?

03:24:35.847 --> 03:24:36.947
TRAVIS: Did you roll it on purpose?

03:24:36.947 --> 03:24:38.332
LAURA: No, but it's a natural 20!

03:24:38.332 --> 03:24:39.927
TRAVIS: No, you've got to roll it on purpose!

03:24:39.927 --> 03:24:42.191
LAURA: Damn it.

03:24:42.191 --> 03:24:45.143
SAM: I'm going to inspire the bear.

03:24:45.143 --> 03:24:47.401
LAURA: What does that mean?

03:24:47.401 --> 03:24:49.016
SAM: I'm going to inspire the bear.

03:24:49.016 --> 03:24:50.425
TRAVIS: How do you do that?

03:24:50.425 --> 03:24:52.008
SAM: By feeding it meat.

03:24:52.008 --> 03:24:54.691
LAURA: Okay. (gasps)

03:24:54.691 --> 03:24:59.117
SAM: Go on, Trinket. Smell real well tonight,
Trinket!

03:24:59.117 --> 03:25:02.187
TRAVIS: Trinket takes the meat and just starts
gobbling it down.

03:25:02.187 --> 03:25:10.375
SAM: And I will actually inspire the bear.

03:25:10.375 --> 03:25:13.576
LAURA: Great. So 26.

03:25:13.576 --> 03:25:21.410
TRAVIS: Trinket comes over and he begins sniffing
the body, and he does recognize some of the scent.

03:25:21.410 --> 03:25:30.358
It's almost that of an animal, like perhaps
another bear, or a wolf even. Some sort of animal

03:25:30.358 --> 03:25:42.341
scent on the body. Right then, Trinket (groans)
and this little hairball covered in mucus comes out.

03:25:42.341 --> 03:25:45.219
LAURA: What's going on?

03:25:45.219 --> 03:25:46.692
SAM I don't know!

03:25:46.692 --> 03:25:50.824
TRAVIS: (bear dry heaving)

03:25:50.824 --> 03:25:54.100
(laughter)

03:25:54.100 --> 03:25:57.551
TRAVIS: And you flip Trinket over on his back and
pat his stomach.

03:25:57.551 --> 03:26:01.651
LIAM: I would like, not in the game but out of the
game, to hide.

03:26:01.651 --> 03:26:06.865
SAM: Oh no, does anyone know CP-bear?

03:26:06.865 --> 03:26:20.789
TRAVIS: That's what our dachshund does. Trinket
takes 27 points of poison damage.

03:26:20.789 --> 03:26:25.200
LAURA: I think he's dead.

03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:30.057
TALIESIN: Well, he's unconscious. I think he goes
back into the necklace.

03:26:30.057 --> 03:26:34.132
LAURA: Yeah, but I'm going to kill Scanlan
anyway.

03:26:34.132 --> 03:26:43.314
TRAVIS: Hold on. So Trinket (groans). Face first,
ass up in the air, and goes back into your

03:26:43.314 --> 03:26:44.875
necklace.

03:26:44.875 --> 03:26:58.335
LAURA: I bamf him back out and heal him. I cast
Cure Wounds at 3rd-level. What are you doing down

03:26:58.335 --> 03:26:59.590
on the ground?

03:26:59.590 --> 03:27:01.912
LIAM: I'm hiding because you're going to murder
our friend.

03:27:01.912 --> 03:27:07.695
SAM: I don't what's happened to your bear!
Something's wrong with him!

03:27:07.695 --> 03:27:11.860
TRAVIS: Trinket heals 15 points. Do you leave him
out?

03:27:11.860 --> 03:27:15.659
LAURA: Yeah, I leave him out, and I cast Speak
with Animals on him.

03:27:15.659 --> 03:27:17.105
SAM: I think you've done that already today.

03:27:17.105 --> 03:27:22.008
LAURA: And I have another one, you dick! It only
lasts ten minutes. And I go: Trinket, what

03:27:22.008 --> 03:27:23.159
happened?

03:27:23.159 --> 03:27:31.378
TRAVIS: "Well, I had the worst stomachache. I
don't know, I ate that meatball from Scanlan and

03:27:31.378 --> 03:27:42.111
"then I fucking died. I don't want to make any
assumptions, but--"

03:27:42.111 --> 03:27:53.192
(laughter)

03:27:53.192 --> 03:28:02.523
LAURA: Scanlan! Did you kill my bear? Did you kill
him? Why would you do that?

03:28:02.523 --> 03:28:09.035
SAM: I-- (laughs)

03:28:09.035 --> 03:28:11.365
TALIESIN: Who betrayed this grizzly murder?

03:28:11.365 --> 03:28:20.815
SAM: (wheezing) I don't know! I mean, maybe it was
something else? Maybe it was the unicorn?

03:28:20.815 --> 03:28:22.919
LAURA: I try to put Scanlan in the necklace.

03:28:22.919 --> 03:28:28.281
TRAVIS: How does that shit work? You've got the
card, right?

03:28:28.281 --> 03:28:30.555
LAURA: I think he has to be willing.

03:28:30.555 --> 03:28:32.183
TRAVIS: Scanlan, make a deception check.

03:28:32.183 --> 03:28:46.186
SAM: It was the unicorn's powerful magic.
Deception check? 33.

03:28:46.186 --> 03:28:53.706
TRAVIS: He really doesn't know. He doesn't know
what Trinket's talking about.

03:28:53.706 --> 03:28:56.821
LAURA: So I don't try to put him in the necklace?
But don't I have to roll?

03:28:56.821 --> 03:29:00.015
SAM: You can beat my deception. You can roll
against it, right?

03:29:00.015 --> 03:29:06.951
LAURA: Well, I can. But you have to roll a DC
wisdom save.

03:29:06.951 --> 03:29:09.595
TRAVIS: Just roll a wisdom saving throw.

03:29:09.595 --> 03:29:14.182
SAM: What's the DC?

03:29:14.182 --> 03:29:16.014
LAURA: Ten.

03:29:16.014 --> 03:29:20.637
SAM: I rolled a 15. But it's minus two! But it's
still 13.

03:29:20.637 --> 03:29:23.806
LAURA: Balls. Well, do I believe him?

03:29:23.806 --> 03:29:26.104
TRAVIS: You do believe him. He doesn't know.

03:29:26.104 --> 03:29:28.819
SAM: I don't know what happened with your bear.

03:29:28.819 --> 03:29:31.811
TRAVIS: He seems quite flummoxed over Trinket's
sudden--

03:29:31.811 --> 03:29:35.500
LAURA: It's just so weird that he got sick right
after you gave him food.

03:29:35.500 --> 03:29:41.007
SAM: You know, I found that meat back there. Maybe
it was poison or something, but I wouldn't know

03:29:41.007 --> 03:29:44.608
from poison, I'm a simple pauper.

03:29:44.608 --> 03:29:52.328
LIAM: You know, I have never seen you feed a
single thing to that bear in all the time we've

03:29:52.328 --> 03:29:53.591
known you.

03:29:53.591 --> 03:29:57.585
TALIESIN: That is peculiar, isn't it? The
deception was against her, I think you have to

03:29:57.585 --> 03:29:58.917
roll separately for us.

03:29:58.917 --> 03:30:01.107
LIAM: What was your reasoning for feeding Trinket
right now?

03:30:01.107 --> 03:30:03.403
SAM: Seemed hungry!

03:30:03.403 --> 03:30:06.355
LIAM: He's always hungry, Scanman.

03:30:06.355 --> 03:30:11.201
TRAVIS: You're interrupted by an explosion from
the top of the tower. A sound of noise.

03:30:11.201 --> 03:30:19.136
(deep humming) A flash of light. Your attention is
directed to the top of the tower. What do you do?

03:30:19.136 --> 03:30:21.763
LAURA: Is the electric field still up?

03:30:21.763 --> 03:30:23.369
TRAVIS: It seems to have dissipated.

03:30:23.369 --> 03:30:24.834
TALIESIN: I'm climbing up the tower.

03:30:24.834 --> 03:30:27.458
LAURA: I fly up, put Trinket back in my necklace
and fly up.

03:30:27.458 --> 03:30:29.948
TRAVIS: Fly up. Spider walk.

03:30:29.948 --> 03:30:31.100
SAM: Climb.

03:30:31.100 --> 03:30:35.008
TRAVIS: Climb. Athletics checks for Percy and
Scanlan.

03:30:35.008 --> 03:30:38.210
SAM: First, I'm going to bonus Healing Word myself
again.

03:30:38.210 --> 03:30:45.018
TALIESIN: A seven. I mean, it's just walking.

03:30:45.018 --> 03:30:46.365
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:30:46.365 --> 03:30:48.266
SAM: Is this an acrobatics check?

03:30:48.266 --> 03:30:49.371
TRAVIS: Athletics.

03:30:49.371 --> 03:30:57.993
SAM: Athletics check. I will inspire myself. Ooh,
that's four plus three plus four.

03:30:57.993 --> 03:31:07.636
TRAVIS: Four plus three plus four, that's good.
Great. As Percy is walking up the tower, he trips

03:31:07.636 --> 03:31:13.688
and falls into the tower and smashes his face and
stands back up with his boots. You take eight

03:31:13.688 --> 03:31:15.854
points of smash-your-face damage.

03:31:15.854 --> 03:31:17.324
TALIESIN: I regret nothing.

03:31:17.324 --> 03:31:23.643
TRAVIS: Scanlan, you fall after about 15 feet. You
take eight points of bludgeoning damage.

03:31:23.643 --> 03:31:26.696
SAM: I've essentially undone my heal.

03:31:26.696 --> 03:31:33.604
TRAVIS: You start climbing back up to the tower.
You all reach the top. It has a very similar--

03:31:33.604 --> 03:31:49.234
just ignore that. Whatever. And there in the
middle is your friend, Grog. He's like, "Guys! I

03:31:49.234 --> 03:31:55.169
"knew you would come and find me! I mean, one
second we were all in the tavern, and then all of

03:31:55.169 --> 03:32:03.587
"a sudden it went hazy. You won't believe what I've
had to go through. There was a big hallway with a

03:32:03.587 --> 03:32:05.644
"ghost, and then there were all these monsters."

03:32:05.644 --> 03:32:06.685
SAM: Insight check.

03:32:06.685 --> 03:32:08.221
TRAVIS: Roll an insight check.

03:32:08.221 --> 03:32:10.217
LIAM: If it's a doppelganger, we have to murder
him together.

03:32:10.217 --> 03:32:12.117
SAM: Nine.

03:32:12.117 --> 03:32:16.219
LIAM: Insight check for sure. Oh, that's
terrible.

03:32:16.219 --> 03:32:17.536
LAURA: I'm going to join in.

03:32:17.536 --> 03:32:19.276
LIAM: Four.

03:32:19.276 --> 03:32:20.439
TALIESIN: Six.

03:32:20.439 --> 03:32:23.506
SAM: Four, six, nine, and--?

03:32:23.506 --> 03:32:25.479
LIAM: Come on, girl!

03:32:25.479 --> 03:32:26.939
LAURA: 15!

03:32:26.939 --> 03:32:35.478
TRAVIS: You can tell that Grog is telling the
truth. "I had to walk through all these things and

03:32:35.478 --> 03:32:41.829
"I came to this door and I saw a star and I
recognized the star on the door as the symbol of the

03:32:41.829 --> 03:32:49.280
"Dallas Cowboys and I went in and I found a healing
potion and I had to go up. There was this thing up

03:32:49.280 --> 03:32:54.212
"there and I had to kill it, and when I did there
was like a zoo I was in! There were all these

03:32:54.212 --> 03:33:05.480
"other creatures and these partitions and I'm here.
I'm so glad-- did you teleport here, or Plane Shifty?"

03:33:05.480 --> 03:33:09.464
SAM: We did the same thing what you did.

03:33:09.464 --> 03:33:11.429
LAURA: Yeah, we were just a little behind you.

03:33:11.429 --> 03:33:14.946
TRAVIS: "You didn't fight your way here, did you?
You didn't go through the rooms?"

03:33:14.946 --> 03:33:17.153
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that whole thing.

03:33:17.153 --> 03:33:18.540
SAM: Why?

03:33:18.540 --> 03:33:25.198
TRAVIS: "I don't want to fight you." You hear a
voice echo from above you as you see a cloaked,

03:33:25.198 --> 03:33:36.048
levitating figure take form. A female voice shouts
out, "I need a hero! I need a hero until the end

03:33:36.048 --> 03:33:44.493
"of the night! He's got to be strong, he's got to
be fast, he's got to be fresh from the fight!" And

03:33:44.493 --> 03:33:50.651
you see Trish the Dish floating above the
platform. Trish, the god of Whitestone, looking

03:33:50.651 --> 03:33:53.876
down and saying, "I need one of you to be my
champion."

03:33:53.876 --> 03:33:56.677
LAURA: That's how I pictured your mom singing it.

03:33:56.677 --> 03:34:02.215
TRAVIS: It's pretty close. You should hear her in
church: awful. You see now as Grog shakes his

03:34:02.215 --> 03:34:07.050
head, goes into a rage, and I need you all to roll
initiative.

03:34:07.050 --> 03:34:09.206
SAM: Are we fighting each other or are we just
fighting you?

03:34:09.206 --> 03:34:11.048
LAURA: We're just fighting Grog.

03:34:11.048 --> 03:34:14.049
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

03:34:14.049 --> 03:34:15.296
LIAM: Terrible.

03:34:15.296 --> 03:34:17.321
TALIESIN: 28.

03:34:17.321 --> 03:34:19.580
LAURA: 16.

03:34:19.580 --> 03:34:27.895
LIAM: Stinkaroo. Seven. Rolled a two on the Matt
die.

03:34:27.895 --> 03:34:29.382
SAM: Ten.

03:34:29.382 --> 03:34:36.688
TRAVIS: You watch as Grog goes into a rage and you
see a hesitation. He doesn't want to attack his

03:34:36.688 --> 03:34:44.846
friends. He looks down at his arm and you see
there similar scrapes, cuts, gashes as you saw on

03:34:44.846 --> 03:34:55.940
the corpse below. He looks up, grins, and lets out
a ferocious howl as he transforms into werewolf

03:34:55.940 --> 03:35:11.162
Grog! Destiny fulfilled! The time has come! He
charges forward. He races towards Percy and will

03:35:11.162 --> 03:35:14.782
make a reckless Great Weapon Master attack.

03:35:14.782 --> 03:35:19.425
LIAM: This is Grog porn if ever there was any.

03:35:19.425 --> 03:35:20.667
LAURA: Yeah.

03:35:20.667 --> 03:35:22.047
TRAVIS: 26.

03:35:22.047 --> 03:35:23.640
TALIESIN: That hits.

03:35:23.640 --> 03:35:32.251
TRAVIS: That is 27 points of damage.

03:35:32.251 --> 03:35:36.716
LAURA: Oh man! I really should have healed up
more! Shit!

03:35:36.716 --> 03:35:38.759
LIAM: Hit die! Too late.

03:35:38.759 --> 03:35:41.805
TRAVIS: Minus five. 20.

03:35:41.805 --> 03:35:43.114
TALIESIN: That hits.

03:35:43.114 --> 03:35:56.319
TRAVIS: 24 points of damage. That will end Grog's
turn. Actually, he'll stay there because he's

03:35:56.319 --> 03:35:59.314
within melee range. Next up: Percy.

03:35:59.314 --> 03:36:15.903
TALIESIN: Let me do this. I'm still very
reasonable. Let's do a few things. We're right

03:36:15.903 --> 03:36:23.904
next to each other. You get an attack of
opportunity if-- actually, I'm going to use the

03:36:23.904 --> 03:36:35.825
Cinture of the Stone King to do a shockwave of
thunderous energy. I'm going to cast shockwave at

03:36:35.825 --> 03:36:41.460
level five which is a DC 16.

03:36:41.460 --> 03:36:44.169
TRAVIS: Is that dex?

03:36:44.169 --> 03:36:48.205
TALIESIN: Thunderwave, let me find out.

03:36:48.205 --> 03:37:08.500
TRAVIS: I'll look also. Thunderwave. Constitution
saving throw. Nope.

03:37:08.500 --> 03:37:20.318
TALIESIN: All right, then. Failed save is 2d8
thunder damage and is pushed ten feet away. 2d8

03:37:20.318 --> 03:37:32.130
plus five. I hope I'm doing this right. That's
6d8.

03:37:32.130 --> 03:37:34.057
TRAVIS: Jesus.

03:37:34.057 --> 03:37:41.107
TALIESIN: Boy, this is so much math. Hold on.
Sorry.

03:37:41.107 --> 03:37:43.288
TRAVIS: I know, I hate the ones that have math.

03:37:43.288 --> 03:37:52.901
TALIESIN: Two, four. Six. And one more.

03:37:52.901 --> 03:37:57.066
LAURA: How crazy will it be to go back 
to just rolling one die?

03:37:57.111 --> 03:37:59.751
LIAM: It's going to be the best. The best!

03:37:59.751 --> 03:38:04.015
TALIESIN: 38 points of damage. And you're pushed
ten feet away.

03:38:04.015 --> 03:38:05.717
LAURA: No!

03:38:05.717 --> 03:38:07.823
LIAM: I strike for four hit points of damage.

03:38:07.823 --> 03:38:10.005
TRAVIS: I'm already ten feet away, good.

03:38:10.005 --> 03:38:16.022
TALIESIN: So there we are. The next thing that's
going to happen is I'm going to burn an action

03:38:16.022 --> 03:38:21.395
surge and I'm going to shoot you several times.
First shot.

03:38:21.395 --> 03:38:25.020
LAURA: Hey, Percy, leave some Grog for the rest of
us!

03:38:25.020 --> 03:38:32.422
TALIESIN: Oh, I will. There'll be plenty. First
shot, I'm going to shoot you in the head.

03:38:32.422 --> 03:38:36.113
TRAVIS: That's so casual! Okay!

03:38:36.113 --> 03:38:48.923
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it. My gun jams and I
take five points of psychic damage. So that's

03:38:48.923 --> 03:39:07.601
funny. My gun jams and I'm going to back off to
the right about 30 feet. For my bonus, I'm going

03:39:07.601 --> 03:39:09.783
to heal a little bit and then that's the end of
me.

03:39:09.783 --> 03:39:11.456
TRAVIS: Vex, you're up.

03:39:11.456 --> 03:39:18.492
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to bamf Trinket out and run
up to Grog, but he's not going to attack him.

03:39:18.492 --> 03:39:20.439
TRAVIS: Trinket's going to run up?

03:39:20.439 --> 03:39:26.514
LAURA: Yeah, he's going to run up next to him. I'm
going to Hunter's Mark Grog. Then I'm going to

03:39:26.514 --> 03:39:36.667
shoot him twice. Well, I'm going to shoot him
first, hold on, let's see if it hits. 22.

03:39:36.667 --> 03:39:38.488
TRAVIS: 22 hits.

03:39:38.488 --> 03:39:49.885
LAURA: That's a bramble shot. That's going to be
4d8 of piercing damage plus regular damage! Nine,

03:39:49.885 --> 03:40:10.240
17, 19. Plus-- what was that? 19? 19 plus five is
24 plus eight is 32. Plus lightning. 36. Hunter's

03:40:10.240 --> 03:40:27.895
Mark. 37. Plus sneak attack. 43. 46 damage on the
first arrow, and Grog has to make-- like this is

03:40:27.895 --> 03:40:31.356
going to be really hard for him-- a strength
saving throw.

03:40:31.356 --> 03:40:33.608
LIAM: Come on, one. One!

03:40:33.608 --> 03:40:35.305
TRAVIS: 12.

03:40:35.305 --> 03:40:37.236
LAURA: He's restrained.

03:40:37.236 --> 03:40:45.112
TRAVIS: You notice as you do all this damage of
the physical variety, it's not doing as much

03:40:45.112 --> 03:40:46.708
damage as you thought it might.

03:40:46.708 --> 03:40:50.011
LAURA: Well, Grog is restrained.

03:40:50.011 --> 03:40:52.846
TRAVIS: He's restrained. A raging werewolf.

03:40:52.846 --> 03:40:58.990
LAURA: What does a werewolf take? Silver?

03:40:58.990 --> 03:41:00.202
LIAM: Magic.

03:41:00.202 --> 03:41:02.708
TRAVIS: And remember, Grog has all damage halved.

03:41:02.708 --> 03:41:07.052
LAURA: Oh. Fucking hell! Okay. I'm going to shoot
him again while he's restrained.

03:41:07.052 --> 03:41:08.721
TRAVIS: Sure. Advantage.

03:41:08.721 --> 03:41:13.815
LIAM: Sneak attack damage. 
Did you already use it?

03:41:13.815 --> 03:41:31.250
LAURA: I already used it. That definitely hits.
30-something. Ten, 12, 15. 15 for the second

03:41:31.250 --> 03:41:34.541
arrow, and I fly up in the air.

03:41:34.541 --> 03:41:37.905
TRAVIS: Kick up on the broom and fly up?

03:41:37.905 --> 03:41:43.208
LAURA: Kick up on the broom and fly up in the air.
That high. Sure, why not?

03:41:43.208 --> 03:41:47.211
TRAVIS: Nice job. Scanlan!

03:41:47.211 --> 03:41:50.074
SAM: Scanlan? What do I do?

03:41:50.074 --> 03:41:51.723
TRAVIS: How many hit points do you have?

03:41:51.723 --> 03:42:02.742
SAM: I will bonus action heal myself again.
Consistently healing myself. Good. Yeah, sure.

03:42:02.742 --> 03:42:08.573
All right, that's something. 
Are we trying to kill Grog?

03:42:08.573 --> 03:42:11.456
LAURA: Maybe try to get him unconscious or
something.

03:42:11.456 --> 03:42:14.413
LIAM: We've got to kill him to be sure.

03:42:14.413 --> 03:42:21.077
SAM: All right. I will cast Bigby's Hand at
6th-level, and I will punch Grog.

03:42:21.077 --> 03:42:24.472
TRAVIS: Bigby's Hand comes out. Crunch.

03:42:24.472 --> 03:42:38.736
SAM: It's 10d6, and it just hits because you're
restrained, I think. It's d6s, right?

03:42:38.736 --> 03:42:54.760
It's either 6d8 or 10d6. Let me look it up real fast. 
Bigby's Hand. (muttering)

03:42:54.760 --> 03:42:57.441
Clenched fist. It's 6d8. I need d8.

03:42:57.441 --> 03:43:00.960
TALIESIN: Here's 3d8.

03:43:00.960 --> 03:43:13.587
SAM: All right. That's it. 6d8. That's what I did.
24.

03:43:13.587 --> 03:43:15.345
TRAVIS: 24.

03:43:15.345 --> 03:43:19.791
SAM: Yes. It doesn't automatically crit or
anything, right?

03:43:19.791 --> 03:43:24.332
And then I will back away, slowly.

03:43:24.332 --> 03:43:31.693
TRAVIS: As you hit Grog with Bigby's Hand, you see
the pain ripple through his body, and the wolf

03:43:31.693 --> 03:43:42.027
form fades, painfully. You see his wounds are all
quite evident. He is already quite hurt from his

03:43:42.027 --> 03:43:43.810
struggles up the tower.

03:43:43.810 --> 03:43:46.506
SAM: Maybe speak to him in unicorn language.

03:43:46.506 --> 03:43:48.065
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to try.

03:43:48.065 --> 03:43:56.048
TRAVIS: He takes a knee and says, "I'm hideous.
I thought I really wanted to be like this,

03:43:56.048 --> 03:44:03.879
"but I'm not sure it's all it's cracked up to be.
Percy, you have a silvered sword. End it."

03:44:03.879 --> 03:44:08.441
LIAM: Shank him, Percy.

03:44:08.441 --> 03:44:13.116
TRAVIS: "Wait, you're not really going to do it,
are you?! Fuck! I was kidding. Jesus! Oh my god!"

03:44:13.116 --> 03:44:14.515
TALIESIN: I thought we had an arrangement.

03:44:14.515 --> 03:44:18.677
TRAVIS: "We did, but I wanted to see 
if you'd go through with it! Hold on.

03:44:18.677 --> 03:44:20.670
"Let me get my courage up."

03:44:20.670 --> 03:44:24.115
TALIESIN: Oh my god, what is that behind you? 
I turn, and I run, and I attack him!

03:44:24.115 --> 03:44:26.880
TRAVIS: Roll to attack.

03:44:26.880 --> 03:44:31.681
TALIESIN: That's 26.

03:44:31.681 --> 03:44:35.347
TRAVIS: 26 will hit. It doesn't matter.

03:44:35.347 --> 03:44:37.967
TALIESIN: That's fine.

03:44:37.967 --> 03:44:42.176
TRAVIS: The silvered sword sinks 
into Grog's chest. He goes,

03:44:42.176 --> 03:44:47.741
"Thank you, you dark motherfucker." 
And Grog falls over.

03:44:47.741 --> 03:44:56.878
You hear (laughs), as Trish the Dish, 
above in her robes, says,

03:44:56.878 --> 03:45:08.125
"I see a champion has fallen. You four. Hmm.
Interesting. Another time, then."

03:45:08.125 --> 03:45:12.623
And she evaporates from the air. 
You find yourselves instantly transported

03:45:12.623 --> 03:45:18.391
back to the tavern, with Grog's bloodied body 
on the table, pouring everywhere,

03:45:18.391 --> 03:45:27.426
and the poor old innkeeper going, "Oh my god! 
You're going to have to pay for that."

03:45:27.426 --> 03:45:30.205
SAM: He dies, too?

03:45:30.205 --> 03:45:31.618
TRAVIS: He dies.

03:45:31.618 --> 03:45:33.713
TALIESIN: Quick, what was his son's name?

03:45:33.713 --> 03:45:34.904
TRAVIS: Timothy.

03:45:34.904 --> 03:45:36.115
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

03:45:36.115 --> 03:45:37.708
SAM: Is Grog dead?

03:45:37.708 --> 03:45:41.224
LAURA: Can I use my last Cure Wounds at 3rd-level
and heal him?

03:45:41.224 --> 03:45:43.749
TALIESIN: There's a half-conscious Pike we could
wake up.

03:45:43.749 --> 03:45:47.868
LAURA: Yeah, I'll heal him for now, and then Pike
will really heal him.

03:45:47.868 --> 03:45:49.518
TRAVIS: What has the story taught you?

03:45:49.518 --> 03:45:51.223
SAM: What has the story taught us?

03:45:51.223 --> 03:45:54.020
TRAVIS: How much you care and need Grog.

03:45:54.020 --> 03:45:55.361
LAURA: Yeah, obviously.

03:45:55.361 --> 03:46:00.327
SAM: No, it actually taught us that in the end, 
we have to kill Grog.

03:46:00.327 --> 03:46:01.968
TALIESIN: And we're willing to do it.

03:46:01.968 --> 03:46:06.346
LIAM: And to get while the getting is good. And I
would like to shave the other side of Grog's face

03:46:06.346 --> 03:46:08.008
that I didn't shave that one time.

03:46:08.008 --> 03:46:14.460
TRAVIS: The mystic werewolf powers within him will
regrow, even in an unconscious state, any hair

03:46:14.460 --> 03:46:15.811
that you shave.

03:46:15.811 --> 03:46:19.116
LIAM: Shave, shave, shave. It keeps growing back!

03:46:19.116 --> 03:46:21.964
TRAVIS: And the sun rises on yet another day.

03:46:21.964 --> 03:46:29.223
SAM: Before the sun rises, I cast Wish that Trish
has persistent gonorrhea forever.

03:46:29.223 --> 03:46:34.115
TRAVIS: Is there a DC save against persistent
gonorrhea?

03:46:34.115 --> 03:46:36.167
SAM: I think I do have to roll something.

03:46:36.167 --> 03:46:43.180
TRAVIS: You roll a d20 and I'll roll a d20. Ready?
One, two, three. Eight.

03:46:43.180 --> 03:46:44.470
SAM: 17.

03:46:44.470 --> 03:46:45.879
(laughter)

03:46:45.879 --> 03:46:53.684
TRAVIS: Persistent. The rest of her cursed life.
And that will bring an end to our game.

03:46:53.684 --> 03:46:55.278
TALIESIN: That's amazing!

03:46:55.278 --> 03:47:03.779
SAM: Wow. Wait, because that was the end of
Bunions and Flagons. We're still in character.

03:47:03.779 --> 03:47:06.742
LAURA: Oh, that game was so fun!

03:47:06.742 --> 03:47:11.534
TRAVIS: It really was good, right? It's not as
good as the long-haired guy in the tavern

03:47:11.534 --> 03:47:14.932
down the way. If you want to see 
a real chapter, you should see him.

03:47:14.932 --> 03:47:18.459
LIAM: Did you happen to catch this man's name?

03:47:18.459 --> 03:47:24.682
TRAVIS: No, I didn't. It was something like Bursar
or Cathew. I missed it.

03:47:24.682 --> 03:47:26.551
SAM: Cathew Verser?

03:47:26.551 --> 03:47:27.738
LIAM: Cathew Verser.

03:47:27.738 --> 03:47:29.319
SAM: All right, we'll look out for him.

03:47:29.319 --> 03:47:34.305
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's a champ. But think about what
you want to do differently next time that was--

03:47:34.305 --> 03:47:36.384
LAURA: Questionable?

03:47:36.384 --> 03:47:45.990
TRAVIS: From a strategic-- I'm a genius at
tactics. Percy, I like what you did.

03:47:45.990 --> 03:47:48.074
Scanlan, nicely done.

03:47:48.074 --> 03:47:52.379
SAM: I think bard gnomes are not that good. I
think next time I'm going to be a ranger.

03:47:52.379 --> 03:47:56.741
LIAM: What a shitty combination. 
Can we do a sci-fi bent next time?

03:47:56.741 --> 03:48:04.919
Rifts or Shadowrun or cyberpunk?

03:48:04.919 --> 03:48:06.125
TRAVIS: A do-ron-ron?

03:48:06.125 --> 03:48:07.145
LIAM: A do-ron-ron, yeah.

03:48:07.145 --> 03:48:08.919
LAURA: Grog, that was great.

03:48:08.919 --> 03:48:10.942
LIAM: It was very entertaining.

03:48:10.942 --> 03:48:14.218
TRAVIS: I'm a little bit tired because that was 
a three and a half hour game,

03:48:14.218 --> 03:48:16.089
right in that sweet spot.

03:48:16.089 --> 03:48:18.347
LIAM: Who won the game, though, Grog?

03:48:18.347 --> 03:48:20.282
TRAVIS: Who has the most XP?

03:48:20.282 --> 03:48:21.797
TALIESIN: I have 150 XP.

03:48:21.797 --> 03:48:22.985
LAURA: I have 200.

03:48:22.985 --> 03:48:24.086
LIAM: Ten.

03:48:24.086 --> 03:48:25.640
SAM: I have 300 XP.

03:48:25.640 --> 03:48:32.506
TRAVIS: I have a bonus 500 XP to give, 
but you have to guess my favorite color.

03:48:32.506 --> 03:48:34.015
LAURA: Red.

03:48:34.015 --> 03:48:35.564
TALIESIN: Six.

03:48:35.564 --> 03:48:36.881
LIAM: Titties.

03:48:36.881 --> 03:48:37.883
SAM: Ale.

03:48:37.883 --> 03:48:39.328
TRAVIS: Percy guessed it.

03:48:39.328 --> 03:48:40.539
LIAM: Not titties?

03:48:40.539 --> 03:48:42.148
TRAVIS: It's six.

03:48:42.148 --> 03:48:43.702
LIAM: I don't know you anymore.

03:48:43.702 --> 03:48:48.399
TALIESIN: I've always known you. 
That's why I will be the one to end you.

03:48:48.399 --> 03:48:53.393
TRAVIS: It was so good, I had to give it to you.
I'm going to bed. Good night!

03:48:53.393 --> 03:48:57.535
SAM: I call a servant over, and I say: 
Bring him some chicken.

03:48:57.535 --> 03:49:01.888
TALIESIN: Soy chicken, but at least it's
something.

03:49:01.888 --> 03:49:03.489
TRAVIS: And that's it!

03:49:03.489 --> 03:49:05.667
(cheering)

03:49:05.667 --> 03:49:07.001
TRAVIS: Done! Oh god.

03:49:07.001 --> 03:49:09.994
TALIESIN: I missed Percy. That was really fun.

03:49:09.994 --> 03:49:11.433
LAURA: That was really good.

03:49:11.433 --> 03:49:16.169
TRAVIS: You find in the distance, the T-rex and
the unicorn find each other and start a new

03:49:16.169 --> 03:49:17.632
magical hybrid race.

03:49:17.632 --> 03:49:20.241
LIAM: That's the thumbnail image, right there.

03:49:20.241 --> 03:49:23.423
TRAVIS: Well, that was awful.

03:49:23.423 --> 03:49:26.279
TALIESIN: You did very well.

03:49:26.279 --> 03:49:30.422
TRAVIS: That math is impossible, 
as well as keeping track of that shit.

03:49:30.422 --> 03:49:32.988
TALIESIN: It's panic-inducing back there. 
It's a lot!

03:49:32.988 --> 03:49:36.296
TRAVIS: I don't know how he keeps track 
of all that stuff.

03:49:36.296 --> 03:49:39.522
TALIESIN: Do you have anything taped 
to the screen?

03:49:39.522 --> 03:49:40.662
TRAVIS: It's a mess.

03:49:40.662 --> 03:49:42.749
LAURA: How do you plan the next move 
that you're going to do when every turn

03:49:42.749 --> 03:49:44.081
is your turn, as well?

03:49:44.081 --> 03:49:47.780
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's a big struggle.

03:49:47.780 --> 03:49:49.627
LAURA: "Stroogle?" It is a "stroogle."

03:49:49.627 --> 03:49:51.877
TRAVIS: It is a "stroogle." I suffer from 
the same problem Sam had.

03:49:51.877 --> 03:49:53.940
I think I had a bit too many enemies.

03:49:53.940 --> 03:49:56.087
SAM: You had the perfect amount!

03:49:56.087 --> 03:49:57.204
TRAVIS: Okay, good.

03:49:57.204 --> 03:49:58.801
TALIESIN: It felt good from this end.

03:49:58.801 --> 03:50:02.963
TRAVIS: Well, for those that stayed with us, thank
you. That would be my first and probably only

03:50:02.963 --> 03:50:10.045
foray into being a BM master. We would like to
thank our sponsor for tonight's episode:

03:50:10.045 --> 03:50:11.608
Marvel Puzzle Quest.

03:50:11.608 --> 03:50:17.943
SAM: Go to bit.ly/marvelcrit, and make sure that
they know that you came from Critical Role.

03:50:17.943 --> 03:50:23.838
TRAVIS: Yeah. Thor: Ragnarok comes out this
weekend, and we hope you all enjoy it very much.

03:50:23.838 --> 03:50:31.787
Laura and I will be gone, but next week is
Marisha's Honey Heist, and there will be

03:50:31.787 --> 03:50:36.239
a Talks Machina on Tuesday, apparently. 
I won't be here to talk about it,

03:50:36.239 --> 03:50:39.461
but I'm sure you'll say lovely things.

03:50:39.461 --> 03:50:40.930
LIAM: We will say lovely things.

03:50:40.930 --> 03:50:42.132
TRAVIS: I will watch from Australia.

03:50:42.132 --> 03:50:43.219
LAURA: And also, we have scarves!

03:50:43.219 --> 03:50:46.698
LIAM: The scarves are the fucking bomb. They're so
soft and cozy.

03:50:46.698 --> 03:50:49.169
SAM: They're not those one-sided scarves.

03:50:49.169 --> 03:50:51.436
LAURA: Dual-sided scarves!

03:50:51.436 --> 03:50:56.411
LIAM: Hey, good job with those three of my 400
miniatures, Travis.

03:50:56.411 --> 03:51:00.587
TRAVIS: Hey, man. Thanks. Your miniature
collection is to be applauded. I looked at it,

03:51:00.587 --> 03:51:02.560
and I couldn't see the forest--

03:51:02.560 --> 03:51:05.485
LIAM: How lucky are my eight- and 11-year-old?

03:51:05.485 --> 03:51:06.771
TRAVIS: So lucky.

03:51:06.771 --> 03:51:07.942
LIAM: Yeah.

03:51:07.942 --> 03:51:09.736
LAURA: Love you, baby.

03:51:09.736 --> 03:51:15.815
TRAVIS: Love you. Thank you, guys, and what's the
old signoff? Is it Thursday yet?

03:51:15.815 --> 03:51:19.383
SAM: That was the worst delivery of that line.

03:51:19.432 --> 03:51:21.350
TRAVIS: Good night.

03:51:21.350 --> 03:57:43.761
