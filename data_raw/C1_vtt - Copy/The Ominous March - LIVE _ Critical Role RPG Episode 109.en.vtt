00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.325
BRIAN: What's up, GenCon?!

00:00:07.325 --> 00:00:13.896
(cheering)

00:00:13.896 --> 00:00:19.203
BRIAN: That's a lot of people. How you guys
doing?

00:00:19.203 --> 00:00:23.196
(cheering)

00:00:23.196 --> 00:00:36.127
BRIAN: Oh my god. Send me the bill for your plane
ticket! If you guys think this outfit is

00:00:36.127 --> 00:00:45.957
ridiculous, you have literally not seen anything
yet. Okay. Thank you for waiting. What?

00:00:45.957 --> 00:00:48.251
(muffled shout)

00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:55.065
BRIAN: You know what's up, brother. Thank you guys
for waiting. I heard, Tico told me that people

00:00:55.065 --> 00:01:03.155
were out there at 6:00am waiting? You guys! We're
about to watch people play Dungeons and Dragons!

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:07.826
(cheering)

00:01:07.826 --> 00:01:15.264
BRIAN: What is happening?! We are alive at the
best moment in history. Right now, there's a

00:01:15.264 --> 00:01:21.115
stadium full of people basically watching this
live on the internet, and going,

00:01:21.115 --> 00:01:23.397
"How did Ashley let him wear that?"

00:01:23.397 --> 00:01:30.026
(laughter)

00:01:30.026 --> 00:01:43.455
BRIAN: Okay, let's start. Let's get started.
(laughs) It is I, your host for the evening,

00:01:43.455 --> 00:01:54.962
Recession-Friendly Ryan Seacrest. This outfit is
what happens when you take 'shrooms before

00:01:54.962 --> 00:01:57.166
creating a Saint's Row character.

00:01:57.166 --> 00:02:00.346
(laughter)

00:02:00.346 --> 00:02:06.661
BRIAN: All right. You guys already sound a little
warmed up.

00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:14.747
(cheering)

00:02:14.747 --> 00:02:24.374
BRIAN: Yeah. But! Just to make sure, because the
live shows are all about the audience

00:02:24.374 --> 00:02:31.836
participation. We're going to go over a couple of
rules for that really fast, but before we do, I

00:02:31.836 --> 00:02:37.106
get paid to be the hype man, so let me get you
guys hyped up.

00:02:37.106 --> 00:02:48.248
(cheering)

00:02:48.248 --> 00:02:56.749
BRIAN: Okay, wait. Okay. When I say, "Tary," you
say "Who?" Tary!

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:57.846
AUDIENCE: Who!

00:02:57.846 --> 00:02:58.532
BRIAN: Tary!

00:02:58.532 --> 00:02:59.384
AUDIENCE: Who!

00:02:59.384 --> 00:03:02.757
BRIAN: When I say, "Tary," you say, "Who?" Tary!

00:03:02.757 --> 00:03:03.636
AUDIENCE: Who?

00:03:03.636 --> 00:03:04.419
BRIAN: Tary!

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:05.257
AUDIENCE: Who?

00:03:05.257 --> 00:03:08.377
BRIAN: When I say, "Tary," you say "What!" Tary!

00:03:08.377 --> 00:03:09.307
AUDIENCE: What!

00:03:09.307 --> 00:03:10.136
BRAIN: Tary!

00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:11.032
AUDIENCE: What!

00:03:11.032 --> 00:03:19.758
BRAIN: Goddamn. Okay, that's it. Warm-up time
over. That was easy. Okay, here's the deal.

00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:24.707
Sometimes, people in the Twitch chat don't like
Critical Role Live because the audience

00:03:24.707 --> 00:03:40.188
participates. Those people-- (laughs) Those
people-- hold on. I just want to say, with all the

00:03:40.188 --> 00:03:44.849
love and respect in my heart, those people can
tune off right now.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:51.213
(cheering)

00:03:51.213 --> 00:03:55.319
BRIAN: Because I don't know about you, but when
I'm at home watching Critical Role, and someone

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.537
gets a "how do you want to do this," I fucking
scream!

00:03:58.537 --> 00:04:02.618
(cheering)

00:04:02.618 --> 00:04:15.310
BRIAN: Okay. Here's what you can do. You can
laugh, you can cheer, you can scream, you can cry.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:22.265
You can stand up and blow the roof off this place
if something cool happens. You can hug your

00:04:22.265 --> 00:04:29.228
neighbor, and get drunk after the show if
something sad happens. And then someone please

00:04:29.228 --> 00:04:37.243
tweet me the bar that you're at, and I will join
you... with Travis Willingham's American Express.

00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:54.474
Which is currently in my fanny pack. Please do not
shout rules. Please do not shout advice. Please do

00:04:54.474 --> 00:05:05.286
not shout corrections. Please do not shout ideas.
Odds are, your idea is probably better that what

00:05:05.286 --> 00:05:12.299
some of the stuff they're going to come up with
is. However, part of the thing that is so

00:05:12.299 --> 00:05:19.236
endearing about this show is watching these
nerdy-ass voice actors figure out how to play

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:21.171
Dungeons and Dragons.

00:05:21.171 --> 00:05:34.858
Isn't it? That's what I love about it. Okay. It's
disruptive, and it'll light the community on fire,

00:05:34.858 --> 00:05:41.151
and we like to keep these live things, but all
that being said, please laugh, please cheer.

00:05:41.151 --> 00:05:44.797
There's going to be so much cool stuff. Oh, I was
supposed to throw these out.

00:05:44.797 --> 00:06:01.490
(cheering)

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:14.883
BRIAN: (laughs) Okay. All right. Thank you, guys.
Who came here from outside the US? Cheer.

00:06:14.883 --> 00:06:17.289
(cheering)

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:34.917
BRIAN: Wow! Really? For this? Look at me! Without
further ado, I would like to introduce the cast of

00:06:34.917 --> 00:06:38.248
a little show we like to call Critical Role.

00:06:38.248 --> 00:07:02.317
Travis Willingham!

00:07:02.317 --> 00:07:17.319
Laura Bailey!

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:31.629
Liam O'Brien!

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:44.008
Marisha Ray!

00:07:44.008 --> 00:07:58.358
Taliesin Jaffe!

00:07:58.358 --> 00:08:40.569
Children, shield your eyes. I present to you: Sam
Riegel!

00:08:40.569 --> 00:09:03.101
And the man that brought us all together. Ladies
and gentlemen, Matthew Mercer!

00:09:03.101 --> 00:09:07.455
The cast of Critical Role, ladies and gentlemen!

00:09:07.455 --> 00:09:23.302
(cheering)

00:09:23.302 --> 00:09:24.237
TRAVIS: All right.

00:09:24.237 --> 00:09:28.180
LAURA: All right.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.416
TRAVIS: Fuck! Fucking shit!

00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:59.406
(cheering)

00:09:59.406 --> 00:10:08.081
MATT: So that's surreal. Oh man. Well, we're all
so excited for you guys to join us tonight, both

00:10:08.081 --> 00:10:13.713
here in person and out there on the internet. How
crazy is it that we live in a world where, right

00:10:13.713 --> 00:10:17.615
now, we have people here live in this fantastic
theater to watch Dungeons and Dragons?

00:10:17.615 --> 00:10:28.661
(cheering)

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:34.870
MATT: For all the crazy shit going on in the
world, it's nice to know that we can carve some

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.779
good out of it here tonight.

00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:42.933
(cheering)

00:10:42.933 --> 00:10:45.359
MATT: And in that regard, so we don't keep you too
long before we can get to the game which you all

00:10:45.359 --> 00:10:54.712
came here to watch, let's go through some quick
announcements. Very quick. In fact, I think the

00:10:54.712 --> 00:10:57.420
big announcement, if Liam and Taliesin want to
take that?

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:10.036
LIAM: Sure. So Taliesin and I have been working on
something for about a year, with around 89 artists

00:11:10.036 --> 00:11:22.458
from our community. It's been a glimmer in our eye
for over a year, and it is almost here. We're

00:11:22.458 --> 00:11:27.906
going to be releasing, in the fall from the Geek &amp;amp;
Sundry store, a Critical Role art book.

00:11:27.906 --> 00:11:50.400
(cheering)

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:55.162
SAM: Liam, they're excited about reading. They
love books!

00:11:55.162 --> 00:11:58.302
TALIESIN: We've only told them about the pictures
so far.

00:11:58.302 --> 00:12:03.805
LIAM: You guys know what a crucial part of this
community the artists have become, and we have

00:12:03.805 --> 00:12:10.883
selected 89 artists from many more; there wasn't
enough-- pages are limited, do I have a page

00:12:10.883 --> 00:12:11.963
number on here?

00:12:11.963 --> 00:12:15.115
TALIESIN: 260 something pages?

00:12:15.115 --> 00:12:17.044
BRIAN: 256, Liam!

00:12:17.044 --> 00:12:18.951
TALIESIN: 256 pages.

00:12:18.951 --> 00:12:29.129
LIAM: We've seen it, and it is beautiful. There's
going to be a deluxe edition and a standard

00:12:29.129 --> 00:12:36.164
edition. It will be available for sale in the Geek
&amp;amp; Sundry store in the late fall, published by

00:12:36.164 --> 00:12:37.492
Hunters Books.

00:12:37.492 --> 00:12:48.278
TALIESIN: I'll say, regardless of what version,
when you actually get the book, it's going to be

00:12:48.278 --> 00:12:57.245
treated as an artifact from the Cobalt Reserve, so
there's going to be historical texts and writings

00:12:57.245 --> 00:13:04.390
from various librarians in the Cobalt Reserve,
chronicling the adventures of Vox Machina,

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:18.099
including a lot of fun Easter eggs. And there will
be some fun Easter eggs in there, there may even

00:13:18.099 --> 00:13:21.354
be some background meta data that doesn't really
exist anywhere else.

00:13:21.354 --> 00:13:27.358
LIAM: Yeah. This is not your basic, go the CVS
store and get a photo book made. A lot of love and

00:13:27.358 --> 00:13:34.218
care went into this. We've been talking with
artists for months and months. A lot of blood,

00:13:34.218 --> 00:13:37.223
sweat and tears have gone into this. We're very
grateful to the artists who are involved, some of

00:13:37.223 --> 00:13:38.944
them are in this audience tonight; thank you.

00:13:38.944 --> 00:13:52.148
(cheering)

00:13:52.148 --> 00:13:57.631
LIAM: We stood around and looked at a proof of
this about a week ago, and I might have gotten a

00:13:57.631 --> 00:14:03.924
little verklempt. It is really special. So keep
your eyes open for it. Oh yeah, one last thing. To

00:14:03.924 --> 00:14:09.045
keep up to date, I'm sure we'll talk more about
it, but you can visit geekandsundry.com/artbook to

00:14:09.045 --> 00:14:12.295
sign up for email updates and book previews, so do
so.

00:14:12.295 --> 00:14:20.037
TALIESIN: It should be available for ordering
sometime in the late fall.

00:14:20.037 --> 00:14:23.907
ALL: Late fall!

00:14:23.907 --> 00:14:25.541
MATT: Thank you guys very much.

00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:26.947
LAURA: Yeah, thank you guys.

00:14:26.947 --> 00:14:30.386
MATT: These two busted their ass on this book.

00:14:30.386 --> 00:14:39.052
(cheering)

00:14:39.052 --> 00:14:56.977
MATT: The other quick announcement we have: it's a
fun little thing that'll be tomorrow for those of

00:14:56.977 --> 00:14:59.954
us at GenCon, and if it goes over well hopefully
at other events in future, but when we released

00:14:59.954 --> 00:15:10.157
the Tal'Dorei campaign guide, the original design
of the cover was from a POV of Scanlan, and there

00:15:10.157 --> 00:15:16.575
was some dissent in the community that Scanlan
wasn't in full display on the cover. So I

00:15:16.575 --> 00:15:21.025
contacted Aaron Riley, the fantastic artist that
worked on our cover, and we got some vinyl decals

00:15:21.025 --> 00:15:31.548
made so you can put one of two different pictures
of Scanlan on your cover of the book or any book

00:15:31.548 --> 00:15:33.108
or art piece you find.

00:15:33.108 --> 00:15:41.092
(cheering)

00:15:41.092 --> 00:15:45.491
MATT: We're hoping to have those in tomorrow, for
those who can come to the signing, and even if you

00:15:45.491 --> 00:15:48.716
didn't get a ticket for the signing, come to the
event anyway. We will have those available to pass

00:15:48.716 --> 00:15:53.531
out, hopefully. So you can pick from the two, or
grab one of each, it's going to be ridiculous. One

00:15:53.531 --> 00:15:55.386
of the particular images, I'm excited to see where
Scanlan shows up.

00:15:55.386 --> 00:15:56.827
LAURA: They're really great.

00:15:56.827 --> 00:15:57.970
MATT: It's absurd.

00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:59.970
LIAM: Why's this small man on the Sistine Chapel?

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:04.600
(laughter)

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:10.545
MATT: That's why they're vinyl; you can remove
them without damaging property. I think. We'll

00:16:10.545 --> 00:16:14.451
find out. Anyway, without further ado, I think
that brings us to the end of our announcements for

00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:23.296
the evening, and as such, bring us into tonight's
episode of Critical Role.

00:16:23.296 --> 00:17:51.963
[dramatic music]

00:17:51.963 --> 00:18:02.238
TRAVIS: Let's go!

00:18:02.238 --> 00:18:05.524
MATT: All right, let's bring this down.

00:18:05.524 --> 00:18:09.271
MARISHA: Holy shit.

00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:12.472
LIAM: Vecna's Amish taint.

00:18:12.472 --> 00:18:15.315
(laughter)

00:18:15.315 --> 00:18:22.531
MATT: A little late, but thank you. I appreciate
that. Last we left off, Vox Machina, in their trek

00:18:22.531 --> 00:18:28.354
to eventually hopefully seal and be rid of the
threat of Vecna, the Whispered One, in his

00:18:28.354 --> 00:18:33.449
recently ascended godhood on the Prime Material
Plane, found themselves traversing below the

00:18:33.449 --> 00:18:41.487
sub-ocean volcano, the Scaldseat, where they
managed to water-breathe their way through a jug.

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:52.773
They traversed the poisonous air within, and
coming upon the Allhammer's Core Anvil, on which

00:18:52.773 --> 00:18:58.869
many artifacts of the Founding and beyond were
forged. There, you fought with the forge guardian,

00:18:58.869 --> 00:19:04.255
who was left to see who has proven worthy to
utilize its components. You defeated it, and in

00:19:04.255 --> 00:19:10.908
doing so, Percival, with the designs bestowed upon
you from Ioun, and Grog, with the bestowed-upon

00:19:10.908 --> 00:19:16.512
knowledge of blacksmithing, took to the blacksmith
tools and together managed to forge, barely

00:19:16.512 --> 00:19:25.188
successfully with a modicum of structural
integrity, the three Prime Trammels, hopefully

00:19:25.188 --> 00:19:30.161
intended to destroy-- or at least seal off--
Vecna's influence on this plane.

00:19:30.161 --> 00:19:38.781
The trammels now complete, each glowing with the
runes of each gifted deity power source. We have

00:19:38.781 --> 00:19:43.579
one that glows yellow across its runic outside,
one that is a sky blue, and one that emanates a

00:19:43.579 --> 00:19:47.976
black shadow from its runes, representing each
deity that bequeathed an element of their power

00:19:47.976 --> 00:19:55.311
unto these trammels. You then decided to have
Scanlan drop his magnificent mansion and decide

00:19:55.311 --> 00:20:00.130
where your next journey was. As you all enter the
mansion, preparing for an evening's rest or

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:05.896
otherwise, we left off with you, now, away from
the heat of the volcano, plotting your next

00:20:05.896 --> 00:20:07.520
directional path.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.223
So Vox Machina, what do you want to do?

00:20:10.223 --> 00:20:12.463
LIAM: That's a great question.

00:20:12.463 --> 00:20:15.654
LAURA: Let me see those trammels. Who has the
trammels?

00:20:15.654 --> 00:20:17.029
TRAVIS: I do. Why?

00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:18.431
LAURA: I just want to look at them.

00:20:18.431 --> 00:20:19.596
TRAVIS: All of them or just one?

00:20:19.596 --> 00:20:21.036
LAURA: All of them.

00:20:21.036 --> 00:20:22.724
TRAVIS: Fucking hell, shit. Here you go.

00:20:22.724 --> 00:20:25.787
LAURA: That's it. I just want to hold them,
really.

00:20:25.787 --> 00:20:28.643
TRAVIS: They're real big, right?

00:20:28.643 --> 00:20:32.740
LAURA: Yeah, I'm cradling them, Grog.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:36.236
MATT: Surprisingly, though, due to the platinum's
design, they're not as heavy as you expect them,

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:39.414
whether it'd be the enchantment or the material
that it was made from. They're still heavy for

00:20:39.414 --> 00:20:42.302
you, Vex, because your strength is pretty shitty.

00:20:42.302 --> 00:20:48.431
LAURA: Can I tell which one is which god?

00:20:48.431 --> 00:20:53.158
MATT: Yes. The one that glows yellow, you feel a
slight bit of kinship with the blessing you

00:20:53.158 --> 00:20:58.035
received from Pelor, the Dawnfather. The other
two, you can differentiate being the sky blue

00:20:58.035 --> 00:21:02.473
color, probably with Ioun, the Knowing Mistress,
and the black probably representing the Raven

00:21:02.473 --> 00:21:04.072
Queen.

00:21:04.072 --> 00:21:07.876
LAURA: All right, cool, I'm going to hold on to
the Pelor one. Pass them back.

00:21:07.876 --> 00:21:09.271
TRAVIS: I've got the other two?

00:21:09.271 --> 00:21:11.639
LAURA: Yeah. I don't know if anybody else wants to
hold one.

00:21:11.639 --> 00:21:16.082
TRAVIS: Just in case things go sour I also thought of
a nice way to use these, and I slide one between

00:21:16.082 --> 00:21:27.755
each of my fingers, and I hold it up. (shink)
Okay, back in the Bag of Holding.

00:21:27.755 --> 00:21:30.805
LIAM: Are you still embiggened right now?

00:21:30.805 --> 00:21:32.782
TRAVIS: No, I haven't been biggened for a while.

00:21:32.782 --> 00:21:35.782
LAURA: Yeah, he was only big fighting the
bulette.

00:21:35.782 --> 00:21:45.322
TRAVIS: Oh, wait. By the way, I believe you said
that if I successfully did all of these trammels

00:21:45.322 --> 00:21:53.183
that you had something for me. Thought I wouldn't
remember, did you?

00:21:53.183 --> 00:21:57.854
(laughter)

00:21:57.854 --> 00:22:05.123
LIAM: I did say that. It's rather personal,
though, I hope the rest of you can understand

00:22:05.123 --> 00:22:08.762
that. I'm not going to be around for much longer,
so I wanted to say--

00:22:08.762 --> 00:22:11.608
SAM: Do you want us to step out so you can have a
moment?

00:22:11.608 --> 00:22:13.844
LIAM: No, we'll find a minute.

00:22:13.844 --> 00:22:16.872
SAM: What? What does that mean?

00:22:16.872 --> 00:22:22.283
LIAM: It's awkward; it's not something I'm
comfortable talking with--

00:22:22.283 --> 00:22:24.218
LAURA: So you want us to leave?

00:22:24.218 --> 00:22:30.508
LIAM: No! We can talk out a plan. Tonight before
we go to bed. It could be now; it could be later.

00:22:30.508 --> 00:22:33.717
MARISHA: You've said too much about it now.

00:22:33.717 --> 00:22:39.420
LIAM: I take Grog by the arm, and I usher him out
the door of the mansion.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.854
TRAVIS: This is weird.

00:22:40.854 --> 00:22:43.792
LAURA: Outside the mansion? You're out the mansion
now?

00:22:43.792 --> 00:22:44.781
LIAM:Yeah.

00:22:44.781 --> 00:22:46.423
SAM: You're going outside?

00:22:46.423 --> 00:22:47.762
LIAM: Just out the front door.

00:22:47.762 --> 00:22:49.938
SAM: Into the inside of the volcano?

00:22:49.938 --> 00:22:51.148
LIAM: Is it on fire?

00:22:51.148 --> 00:22:52.850
MATT: It's certainly very hot.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:57.517
LIAM: Fuck it, Grog, let's go downstairs.

00:22:57.517 --> 00:22:59.179
TRAVIS: War room!

00:22:59.179 --> 00:23:00.789
MARISHA: He has 40 floors!

00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:03.123
TRAVIS: We're going down to the war room, which is
a sand pit.

00:23:03.123 --> 00:23:06.041
LIAM: Yeah, and I ignore all of the cat-calling
and all of the sniping and all of the shittiness.

00:23:06.041 --> 00:23:07.522
These fucking assholes.

00:23:07.522 --> 00:23:10.192
LAURA: Have fun, you two!

00:23:10.192 --> 00:23:11.867
SAM: Use protection!

00:23:11.867 --> 00:23:19.090
(laughter)

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:23.384
LIAM: That's what Grog is for!

00:23:23.384 --> 00:23:27.227
MATT: The two of you descend the staircase into
the subterranean war room, where there you see

00:23:27.227 --> 00:23:30.727
before you the giant sand pit that is currently
adorned with multiple training dummies with armor

00:23:30.727 --> 00:23:36.169
and weapons. Strapped to them, magnificently
pristine, based on how many times you destroyed

00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:39.454
and/or restructured the chamber, but there it lies
before you.

00:23:39.454 --> 00:23:41.578
LIAM: Big man?

00:23:41.578 --> 00:23:43.023
TRAVIS: Yeah? That's me.

00:23:43.023 --> 00:23:54.366
LIAM: I'm not going to be around much longer,
probably, or you're not going to be around much

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:55.802
longer; one or the other.

00:23:55.802 --> 00:23:56.784
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:23:56.784 --> 00:24:11.214
LIAM: Yeah. Boy, I've been holding on to a thing
for a while now. Taryon, that scamp, gave me a

00:24:11.214 --> 00:24:24.443
gift ages ago. He became a fan after I pranked his
ass at the beach. He caught the bug, and before we

00:24:24.443 --> 00:24:29.063
said our goodbyes, he talked to me for a bit and
gave me something.

00:24:29.063 --> 00:24:31.364
TRAVIS: You pranked his ass, and he caught the
bug?

00:24:31.364 --> 00:24:44.559
(laughter)

00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:55.139
LIAM: Right, I've got to talk simpler; sorry.
That's my mistake. Taryon gave me a very unique

00:24:55.139 --> 00:24:58.253
item, and the purpose of it was to fuck with you.

00:24:58.253 --> 00:25:11.399
(cheering)

00:25:11.399 --> 00:25:15.194
LIAM: I could say "turducken" and you people would
turn it into sexual innuendo!

00:25:15.194 --> 00:25:20.135
(cheering)

00:25:20.135 --> 00:25:22.085
TRAVIS: I don't know what that is.

00:25:22.085 --> 00:25:29.259
LIAM: Anyway, he wanted me to pull a prank on you,
and we have a lot of history with that, and I held

00:25:29.259 --> 00:25:35.853
onto it for a long time, looking for a time that
felt right, and it never happened, and sometimes I

00:25:35.853 --> 00:25:42.087
felt like I didn't want to do that anymore, but I
don't want to let his gift go to waste. And truth

00:25:42.087 --> 00:25:50.256
be told, I did a bit of research on it. It is a
love potion, Grog.

00:25:50.256 --> 00:26:05.007
(gasping and cheering)

00:26:05.007 --> 00:26:10.192
MATT: I forgot about that.
LIAM: Lasts about an hour.

00:26:10.303 --> 00:26:12.985
(laughter)

00:26:12.985 --> 00:26:18.062
LIAM: Lasts about an hour, and for a while, it was
really tempting, and I was looking for a moment

00:26:18.062 --> 00:26:23.032
because that's you and me, that's history. But
then I did some research and it turns out that it

00:26:23.032 --> 00:26:28.085
wouldn't have worked on you, anyway, because if
you want someone to fall in love with you, it has

00:26:28.085 --> 00:26:36.315
to be on a person who you'd be interested in. And
to quote a very handsome dickhead we know, I'm

00:26:36.315 --> 00:26:39.084
pretty sure you go taco, not hot dog.

00:26:39.084 --> 00:26:54.686
(laughter)

00:26:54.686 --> 00:26:57.222
LIAM: So I was right to assume then, yeah?

00:26:57.222 --> 00:27:00.056
TRAVIS: Yep. Taco.

00:27:00.056 --> 00:27:09.015
LIAM: We're not all so limited, but that's your
thing; that's fine. I can't even use it on you,

00:27:09.015 --> 00:27:22.144
but I've got it. And I'm going to miss you. I'll
be gone soon. I don't even know if we have time. A

00:27:22.144 --> 00:27:28.244
lot of us could be dead soon, but I'm not offering
you this thing, but I'm offering you an

00:27:28.244 --> 00:27:29.537
experience.

00:27:29.537 --> 00:27:53.711
(cheering)

00:27:53.711 --> 00:28:02.994
TRAVIS: I don't know a lot of big words, but I
feel like I need a little bit of clarification.

00:28:02.994 --> 00:28:15.168
LIAM: I don't know if we have time for this, but
maybe, for old time's sake, because I love you and

00:28:15.168 --> 00:28:25.224
I know you love me and we share this in common. I
thought maybe we could prank Scanlan together.

00:28:25.224 --> 00:28:44.694
(cheering)

00:28:44.694 --> 00:28:49.298
LIAM: Because let's be honest, that guy would fuck
a turducken in front of him.

00:28:49.298 --> 00:29:01.923
TRAVIS: Just for the record, I had no doubts about
where that conversation was going. None. You have

00:29:01.923 --> 00:29:07.608
a deal. I don't know how or when we are going to
pull this off, but if you don't make time--

00:29:07.608 --> 00:29:11.345
LIAM: Yeah. It could be tonight.

00:29:11.345 --> 00:29:13.320
TRAVIS: Fuck it. It's tonight.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:20.704
(laughter)

00:29:20.704 --> 00:29:29.430
LIAM: Here's what I don't have. I don't have a
plan.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:34.118
TRAVIS: Nope, me neither. We never have those. So
listen, maybe while we're eating some of those

00:29:34.118 --> 00:29:39.006
shitty salads that this fucking place makes now,
you can drizzle it on the top, or does he have to

00:29:39.006 --> 00:29:40.474
drink it with a drink?

00:29:40.474 --> 00:29:44.742
LIAM: I think he just needs to down it one way or
another. It could be mixed with something else; it

00:29:44.742 --> 00:29:46.943
could be on its own.

00:29:46.943 --> 00:29:49.301
TRAVIS: Who do we make him fall in love with?

00:29:49.301 --> 00:29:53.994
LIAM: Well, originally I was thinking maybe we
could have a bet and see which one of us he falls

00:29:53.994 --> 00:29:55.346
in love with.

00:29:55.346 --> 00:30:09.011
(laughter)

00:30:09.011 --> 00:30:12.491
LIAM: And I know that's a shitty idea, but we have
to get up and--

00:30:12.491 --> 00:30:13.993
TRAVIS: I fucking love it.

00:30:13.993 --> 00:30:22.025
(laughter and cheering)

00:30:22.025 --> 00:30:27.195
LIAM: So that means isolating the gnome away from
the others, because he could fall in love with

00:30:27.195 --> 00:30:29.410
literally anything or anyone.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:34.880
TRAVIS: Yeah, but look. The hunter does not go
after its prey in an isolated environment. The

00:30:34.918 --> 00:30:42.555
hunter finds him in his natural habitat. Let him
roam free, I say.

00:30:42.555 --> 00:30:52.148
(laughter)

00:30:52.198 --> 00:31:04.276
LIAM: I'm not sure I know what that means, but I
will carry this baton and follow your lead.

00:31:04.357 --> 00:31:10.814
TRAVIS: Well, look. Before the rest of the group
starts wondering what we're doing in the war room,

00:31:10.814 --> 00:31:16.295
let's go back up and whenever your sneaky ass
thinks it's appropriate you (drip) in his drink.

00:31:16.295 --> 00:31:19.017
How about that?

00:31:19.017 --> 00:31:27.473
LIAM: We'll call that Plan A. Plan B will be that
you grab his ass, and I just shove it in.

00:31:27.473 --> 00:31:43.684
(laughter)

00:31:43.684 --> 00:31:47.782
LIAM: Plan A, Plan B. You know those letters, you
know that far.

00:31:47.782 --> 00:31:53.586
TRAVIS: I do. I know that part. And we head back
to the group.

00:31:53.586 --> 00:31:57.975
SAM: Meanwhile, inside. I'm just so happy to be back in
the group.

00:31:57.975 --> 00:32:03.439
(laughter)

00:32:03.439 --> 00:32:07.959
SAM: It's been a pretty crazy few days but I feel
like you've all accepted me and I'm so happy to be

00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:15.297
back. And I can't thank you enough, really, from
the bottom of my heart. Thank you. Thank you for

00:32:15.297 --> 00:32:17.223
fully accepting me back.

00:32:17.223 --> 00:32:20.242
LAURA: We're really sorry for everything, Scanlan.
You know we love you.

00:32:20.242 --> 00:32:24.476
SAM: I love you, too. Not in a weird way.

00:32:24.476 --> 00:32:28.084
LAURA: No. I'm married.

00:32:28.084 --> 00:32:31.716
SAM: Just friends.

00:32:31.716 --> 00:32:32.981
LAURA: That would be awkward.

00:32:32.981 --> 00:32:34.957
LIAM: Hey, what are you guys talking about?

00:32:34.957 --> 00:32:38.323
SAM: Oh, just how much we love life.

00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:44.179
MARISHA: How we're a happy family, you know?

00:32:44.179 --> 00:32:45.630
LIAM: We are. We are close.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:48.457
TRAVIS: (yells) Who wants a drink?

00:32:48.457 --> 00:32:55.988
(laughter)

00:32:55.988 --> 00:33:04.755
SAM: That's a great idea, Grog. Invisible servants,
bring us the finest vegan wine.

00:33:04.755 --> 00:33:10.066
MATT: As a procession of ghostly entities make
their way from the far-off kitchen on the basement

00:33:10.066 --> 00:33:15.490
floor of Scanlan's magnificent mansion, they
procure a number of glass bottles containing wine.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:19.709
It's just wine.

00:33:19.709 --> 00:33:24.296
SAM: But no added animal fats.

00:33:24.296 --> 00:33:32.448
MATT: You're not wrong. Goblets are placed across
the tables. Drinks are poured and you all have

00:33:32.448 --> 00:33:37.141
within your grasp a fair nightcap, if you will,
before you find rest for the evening.

00:33:37.141 --> 00:33:50.530
TRAVIS: (clears throat) Scanlan. Man. Great
teamwork today. Everyone, really.

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:58.333
LAURA: Yeah, seriously. I'm so amazed with both
you and Percy. You really pulled through, and we

00:33:58.333 --> 00:33:59.875
would be lost without both of you.

00:33:59.875 --> 00:34:01.995
LIAM: I start examining my fingernails and moving
closer to Scanlan.

00:34:01.995 --> 00:34:04.531
(laughter)

00:34:04.531 --> 00:34:18.674
MARISHA: I do feel like our teamwork has been
getting better, though. We've been doing so good.

00:34:18.674 --> 00:34:20.858
Synergizing.

00:34:20.858 --> 00:34:27.180
LAURA: Yeah, that fight could've gone terribly,
and we pulled through as a team.

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:28.531
MARISHA: Oh, a hundred percent.

00:34:28.531 --> 00:34:38.326
SAM: You know what, though? I know in the past,
Vax, I've had my differences with you. I didn't

00:34:38.326 --> 00:34:45.627
like you charging after that dragon that one time,
and we had some issues, but tonight I feel like

00:34:45.627 --> 00:34:50.448
we're close and you would never do anything to
betray me.

00:34:50.448 --> 00:34:57.584
LIAM: Oh, that wine looks really good.

00:34:57.584 --> 00:35:07.199
SAM: Let's take a sip. But first, I was thinking
about how close we've become, Vax, and I even

00:35:07.199 --> 00:35:09.957
wrote you a little inspirational song.

00:35:09.957 --> 00:35:17.093
(cheering)

00:35:17.093 --> 00:35:20.828
LIAM: Here, let me hold your drink.

00:35:20.828 --> 00:35:25.891
SAM: Okay, sure. You'll hold my drink while I
sing. This is just a song to show you how much you mean

00:35:25.891 --> 00:35:37.939
to me and how close we've become over these years.
It's a long one. (rapping) Don't be tired, I'm

00:35:37.939 --> 00:35:43.396
here to inspire. Before you blow out, let me light
your fire. I got no choir, just a gnome and a

00:35:43.396 --> 00:35:46.205
lyre. So listen up to Burt Reynolds, esquire.

00:35:46.205 --> 00:35:47.571
(rhythmic clapping)

00:35:47.571 --> 00:35:54.208
SAM: Oh, that's going to fuck me up. (rapping)
You've got those moves like dagger! You're fast as

00:35:54.208 --> 00:36:01.988
a cat! You can attack five times-- I checked it
with Matt! You can't be killed, and one more

00:36:01.988 --> 00:36:11.583
caveat: You get to sit next to the Poohbah de
Doink of All This and That!

00:36:11.583 --> 00:36:17.229
So imagine a dark room, lit from above. Folks as
far as Czech Republic came to give you their love.

00:36:17.229 --> 00:36:27.937
Your heart is beating like a goddamn drum. It's
singing, "I'm going back to Indiana, Indiana, here

00:36:27.937 --> 00:36:37.289
"I come!" The tension is building, the roof's going
to blow. This ain't a rehearsal, it's the

00:36:37.289 --> 00:36:43.277
motherfucking live show! Mic's rolling, camera's
on, dice rolling, Scanlan's song. No more

00:36:43.277 --> 00:36:47.445
cajoling, this shit is on. This crowd is bigger
than my cube-like dong!

00:36:47.445 --> 00:37:00.077
(cheering)

00:37:00.077 --> 00:37:05.193
SAM: You been down but what's it going to take to
give you some sack, man? How about 2,400 Critters

00:37:05.193 --> 00:37:09.460
chanting, "Vax'ildan! Vax'ildan! Vax'ildan!"

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:13.297
(chanting)

00:37:13.297 --> 00:37:16.507
MATT: Go ahead and make a sleight of hand check.

00:37:16.507 --> 00:37:33.708
LIAM: 29. That was inspiration to me?

00:37:33.708 --> 00:37:40.676
MARISHA: He's inspiring you because he thinks
you're going to fucking fail.

00:37:40.676 --> 00:37:42.726
LIAM: 39.

00:37:42.768 --> 00:37:55.935
MATT: Scanlan, why don't you go ahead and make a
perception check?

00:37:55.935 --> 00:37:59.794
SAM: That's a 12.

00:37:59.794 --> 00:38:09.638
LIAM: I instantly dive and grab Keyleth's eyes and
cover them, and turn her away.

00:38:09.638 --> 00:38:13.933
MARISHA: Stop. Get off of me!

00:38:13.933 --> 00:38:15.089
LIAM: Sorry!

00:38:15.089 --> 00:38:23.073
MARISHA: Why? Your hands are a little clammy. Oh
god! Why are you sweating? Why are you nervous?

00:38:23.073 --> 00:38:24.796
You're nervous!

00:38:24.796 --> 00:38:29.668
MATT: A very strange display from Vax'ildan.
However, your drink is available for you at the

00:38:29.668 --> 00:38:30.487
table.

00:38:30.487 --> 00:38:33.819
SAM: Yeah!

00:38:33.819 --> 00:38:41.109
LAURA: That was a great song, Scanlan.

00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:44.456
SAM: That's good stuff! Man, I just feel invigorated!

00:38:44.456 --> 00:38:55.106
MATT: All right, so as you finish the drink, you
blink your eyes. I'm going to ask you, Scanlan,

00:38:55.106 --> 00:38:59.573
who do you see first?

00:38:59.573 --> 00:39:03.246
SAM: Let's see here, what do we got, six people
over here?

00:39:03.246 --> 00:39:07.266
MATT: Well, you have two that have dove off to the
side.

00:39:07.266 --> 00:39:21.647
SAM: Oh, okay. Then I'll roll a d4. One, two-- oh
wait, it's just three. It was a fucking four. Two!

00:39:21.647 --> 00:39:22.922
Okay, Keyleth.

00:39:22.922 --> 00:39:26.481
MATT: No, Keyleth is being shielded right now.

00:39:26.481 --> 00:39:31.070
SAM: Oh shit! Well, then it's just Vex or Percy?
Or wait, are those two, too?

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:36.359
MATT: The other people in the room right now are
Percival, Vex, or Grog.

00:39:36.359 --> 00:39:42.363
SAM: Okay, well, then it would be Grog. Do I have
three choices or four?

00:39:42.363 --> 00:39:44.426
LAURA: You have four choices!

00:39:44.426 --> 00:39:50.701
SAM: Four choices! All right, and could you raise
your hand if you're one of my choices? Okay. One,

00:39:50.701 --> 00:39:52.788
two, three, four.

00:39:52.788 --> 00:39:54.121
It's Percy.

00:39:54.121 --> 00:40:08.249
(cheering)

00:40:08.249 --> 00:40:16.375
MATT: So here's my question, Scanlan. First and
foremost, let me pull up. Is there a saving throw?

00:40:16.375 --> 00:40:17.706
LIAM: Philter of Love.

00:40:17.706 --> 00:40:18.713
MATT: Right.

00:40:18.713 --> 00:40:24.526
LIAM: I can recite it for you, if you like. The
next time you see a creature within ten minutes

00:40:24.526 --> 00:40:29.461
after drinking this philter, you become charmed by
the creature for one hour. If the creature is of a

00:40:29.461 --> 00:40:36.270
species and gender you are normally attracted to--
turducken-- you regard it as your true love while

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:41.093
you are charmed. This potion's rose-hued
effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss

00:40:41.093 --> 00:40:44.163
bubble shaped like a heart.

00:40:44.163 --> 00:40:45.632
MATT: How long does it last?

00:40:45.632 --> 00:40:47.500
LIAM: One hour.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:51.220
MATT: All right. And I guess my question to you,
Scanlan, is based on your journeys and travels

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:54.897
across the lands of Tal'Dorei and beyond, how
adventurous have you been in your various

00:40:54.897 --> 00:40:58.697
exploits?

00:40:58.697 --> 00:41:13.446
SAM: A human man? That was teenage years, baby.
I've gone much further than that since then.

00:41:13.446 --> 00:41:21.394
MATT: Then as you glance up into the beautiful
eyes of the white-haired Master of Whitestone, his

00:41:21.394 --> 00:41:26.917
white locks gently curling at the tips from an
afternoon of sweating amongst the heat of the

00:41:26.917 --> 00:41:32.893
volcano, his fingers gingerly caressing the
outside of the goblet in which he's enjoyed his

00:41:32.893 --> 00:41:54.092
own wine. You find yourself impossibly attracted
to your once ally, now direction of your

00:41:54.092 --> 00:41:56.325
affection.

00:41:56.325 --> 00:42:06.520
SAM: I don't know. I don't know if it's the wine
talking, but oh man. I feel something I've never

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.488
felt before, Percival.

00:42:08.488 --> 00:42:12.025
TALIESIN: That sounds like the wine talking.

00:42:12.025 --> 00:42:39.079
SAM: I've never seen you in this light before.
Your eyebrows. I want to lick them. They seem soft.

00:42:39.079 --> 00:42:41.982
LAURA: You want to what?!

00:42:41.982 --> 00:42:50.218
SAM: That came out wrong. What I meant was, what
are you doing later?

00:42:50.218 --> 00:42:59.540
LAURA: I walk up and I palm Scanlan's forehead and
slam him to the ground. What the fuck are you

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:00.432
doing?

00:43:00.432 --> 00:43:04.178
SAM: I'm sorry! It's just, well, you've seen it.

00:43:04.178 --> 00:43:23.465
(laughter)

00:43:23.465 --> 00:43:24.682
MATT: Continue.

00:43:24.682 --> 00:43:32.554
SAM: The way he looks at you and everything stops.
The way all sound fades away when he's talking.

00:43:32.554 --> 00:43:36.211
MARISHA: No, that's his Silence spell that he got
recently.

00:43:36.211 --> 00:43:52.421
SAM: The way he &lt;i&gt;cocks&lt;/i&gt; his gun. (groans) Holds it
so firmly. It trembles just a little but then

00:43:52.421 --> 00:44:07.334
&lt;i&gt;bang&lt;/i&gt;. (moans) Just a gentle touch is all it
takes.

00:44:07.334 --> 00:44:13.131
TALIESIN: Would this be an insight check, at this
point?

00:44:13.131 --> 00:44:16.075
MATT: Yes.

00:44:16.075 --> 00:44:18.822
TRAVIS: Please.

00:44:18.822 --> 00:44:21.327
TALIESIN: Oh no.

00:44:21.327 --> 00:44:24.688
TRAVIS: No, it's not! Is it really?

00:44:24.688 --> 00:44:29.887
LAURA: I'm going to feel his forehead. Does he
feel warm?

00:44:29.887 --> 00:44:33.069
TALIESIN: How long have you felt this way? This is
a bit--

00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:47.611
SAM: It feels like forever. (singing) One song,
glory. One song to win your heart, glory. Where do

00:44:47.611 --> 00:44:49.770
I even start?

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.762
TALIESIN: I don't know what's happening right
now.

00:44:51.762 --> 00:44:54.808
SAM: (singing) One song from the pretty boy
gnome.

00:44:54.808 --> 00:45:00.578
TRAVIS: We fucked up. Oh man.

00:45:00.578 --> 00:45:05.932
LAURA: Scanlan, I don't blame you. I don't. This
seems to be coming out of nowhere, and he's

00:45:05.932 --> 00:45:17.242
married to me, and I will cut you!

00:45:17.242 --> 00:45:26.449
SAM: Love knoweth no boundaries, and even though
there's a significant age difference between us--

00:45:26.449 --> 00:45:30.524
LAURA: How much of an age difference?

00:45:30.524 --> 00:45:32.097
SAM: I'm not at liberty to say.

00:45:32.097 --> 00:45:34.992
(laughter)

00:45:34.992 --> 00:45:47.344
SAM: Why does marriage need to be so constricting,
man? I mean, can't we be free in this crazy

00:45:47.344 --> 00:45:49.349
mixed-up world?

00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:59.846
TALIESIN: I'm not going to pretend that I'm not
extremely flattered by this, and I am, but I don't know.

00:45:59.846 --> 00:46:03.753
SAM: I want to see you naked.

00:46:03.753 --> 00:46:12.409
MARISHA: Scanlan, are you experiencing a bit of
cotton mouth? Maybe?

00:46:12.409 --> 00:46:14.123
SAM: (smacking) Yes.

00:46:14.123 --> 00:46:15.588
MARISHA: Are your pupils a little dilated?

00:46:15.588 --> 00:46:16.694
SAM: The lights.

00:46:16.694 --> 00:46:18.344
LAURA: I'm going to look into his eyes. Are his
eyes dilated?

00:46:18.344 --> 00:46:24.694
MARISHA: I turn to Vax. What did you do?

00:46:24.694 --> 00:46:28.790
TALIESIN: Is it that hard to believe that maybe
someone finds me attractive?

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:42.248
(cheering)

00:46:42.248 --> 00:46:47.630
LIAM: Guys, this is all besides the point. We have
a god to kill. What are we going to do about the god?

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:52.887
SAM: Yes. No, we should talk. We should
strategize.

00:46:52.887 --> 00:47:16.824
(laughter and cheering)

00:47:16.824 --> 00:47:24.049
LIAM: I want to step outside the game for a second
to say that Sam Riegel gave me a bullet to kill

00:47:24.049 --> 00:47:29.654
Travis Willingham with, and I have turned the gun
back on Sam Riegel.

00:47:29.654 --> 00:47:39.326
(cheering)

00:47:39.326 --> 00:47:46.215
LIAM: And shortly, it will be my time to die.

00:47:46.215 --> 00:47:53.150
MATT: After this unique and unexpected display of
overt affection, you find yourself sitting around

00:47:53.150 --> 00:48:01.566
a table amongst the mansion to discuss over your
wine and confusion what plan of action to take

00:48:01.566 --> 00:48:04.998
next in your journey to take down the Whispered
One, the Undying King.

00:48:04.998 --> 00:48:11.550
LAURA: I'm going to sit directly between Percy and
Scanlan for all of this conversation.

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:21.799
TRAVIS: So we rest and then we go hunting? Or do
we try and rally allies?

00:48:21.799 --> 00:48:35.810
SAM: I cast Mage Hand to tickle Percy's knee.

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:42.600
LAURA: I have a 23 passive perception, Scanlan.

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.688
MATT: Scanlan, make a sleight of hand check.

00:48:45.688 --> 00:48:49.219
SAM: 20.

00:48:49.219 --> 00:48:52.701
LAURA: What?

00:48:52.701 --> 00:48:57.084
MATT: Yeah, you see him starting to make his
fingers over towards your boy.

00:48:57.084 --> 00:49:04.636
LAURA: I grab his fingers and start to bend them
backwards. I whisper in his ear: do you want to

00:49:04.636 --> 00:49:08.021
keep playing your fucking lute or not?

00:49:08.021 --> 00:49:09.989
SAM: I'd prefer it if Percy did.

00:49:09.989 --> 00:49:21.665
(laughter)

00:49:21.665 --> 00:49:26.320
LAURA: Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you?
How long have you felt this way? Because this is

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.655
very fucking strange, Scanlan.

00:49:27.655 --> 00:49:34.687
SAM: I don't know. It was love at first sight, but
now, so not first. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'll try

00:49:34.687 --> 00:49:46.586
to keep it together. I'll think of gross things.
Victor's ball sack. Ugh.

00:49:46.586 --> 00:49:56.664
MATT: "Learn from my mistakes."

00:49:56.664 --> 00:50:08.455
SAM: Why are they so singed? All right. Okay,
let's focus up. Okay. Go on, strategize.

00:50:08.455 --> 00:50:14.380
LIAM: Time! We don't have a lot of time. So what
are we going to do with it? Are we going to get

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:18.530
allies? Are we going to talk to Allura again?
Gilmore?

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:23.053
TRAVIS: Ooh, wait. First things first, do we know
where he is? Don't you have the ability to like--

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:24.680
LAURA: Oh yeah. Is he still in the same place?

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:28.641
LIAM: I don't know in here; I need to shove my
head out the door for a sec.

00:50:28.641 --> 00:50:30.423
LAURA: Well, shove your head out the door.

00:50:30.423 --> 00:50:37.626
MATT: All right. As you emerge into the heated air
of the sub-ocean volcano, you take a moment and

00:50:37.626 --> 00:50:42.723
concentrate and you can sense the direction and
distance seems to be approximately the same.

00:50:42.723 --> 00:50:44.785
LAURA: He hasn't moved at all?

00:50:44.785 --> 00:50:48.071
MATT: Make a perception check, I guess.

00:50:48.071 --> 00:50:53.334
LIAM: 24.

00:50:53.334 --> 00:51:01.118
MATT: 24. You take about five minutes or so to
concentrate, and while the distance and direction

00:51:01.118 --> 00:51:06.263
is relatively the same, there is very faint
movement.

00:51:06.263 --> 00:51:13.611
LIAM: Am I able to feel gradual coming towards
where we are, away, anything like that?

00:51:13.611 --> 00:51:24.373
MATT: From where you are currently, which is in
the volcano, it seems to be east and south of its

00:51:24.373 --> 00:51:25.952
previous location.

00:51:25.952 --> 00:51:28.017
LAURA: Where would that move him towards?

00:51:28.017 --> 00:51:29.407
MARISHA: Towards Vasselheim.

00:51:29.407 --> 00:51:33.842
LAURA: Solid.

00:51:33.842 --> 00:51:38.366
TALIESIN: We should maybe go to Vasselheim in the
morning, start to rally.

00:51:38.366 --> 00:51:45.043
LAURA: Yeah. Do Allura and Gilmore and Kima and
everyone, do they know what's going on? Have we

00:51:45.043 --> 00:51:46.338
sent word?

00:51:46.338 --> 00:51:48.205
TALIESIN: Well, we've sent some word out to the
world.

00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:52.708
LIAM: We've sent messages to Tary and to who else?
There were two messages sent.

00:51:52.708 --> 00:51:54.162
MARISHA: Tary, the Ashari.

00:51:54.162 --> 00:51:55.708
SAM: Kaylie. I think.

00:51:55.708 --> 00:51:57.531
TALIESIN: We activated the beacons.

00:51:57.531 --> 00:52:03.793
MARISHA: We activated the Chaos Orbs. Crisis Orbs.
I always mess them up.

00:52:03.793 --> 00:52:05.831
TRAVIS: So we should rest and head to Vasselheim?

00:52:05.831 --> 00:52:09.880
TALIESIN: We're not any good to anybody at the
moment, so I imagine so.

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:20.384
LIAM: I think we'll all feel better after a
night's sleep. Yeah.

00:52:20.384 --> 00:52:23.979
TRAVIS: Scanlan, where are you sleeping tonight?

00:52:23.979 --> 00:52:26.637
SAM: In my room.

00:52:26.637 --> 00:52:31.596
TRAVIS: Do we need to post guards outside?

00:52:31.596 --> 00:52:35.690
SAM: I have all the guards I need. Don't worry,
I'll be safe.

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:39.284
MARISHA: We're not worried about you.

00:52:39.284 --> 00:52:41.487
TALIESIN: It'll be fine.

00:52:41.487 --> 00:52:43.450
LAURA: It'll be fine!

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:47.170
TRAVIS: (laughs) It'll be great.

00:52:47.170 --> 00:53:02.052
SAM: So we're going to sleep and then to
Vasselheim?

00:53:02.052 --> 00:53:04.218
TRAVIS: We rest and then we go.

00:53:04.218 --> 00:53:07.387
TALIESIN: That's the plan.

00:53:07.387 --> 00:53:08.286
LAURA: Yeah.

00:53:08.286 --> 00:53:09.557
SAM: Okay, let's do it.

00:53:09.557 --> 00:53:11.789
MATT: All right. Finishing your wine, you all
scatter to your various rooms throughout the

00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:17.801
mansion, prepare yourselves for an evening's rest.
In the morning, journey to the cradle of

00:53:17.801 --> 00:53:20.216
civilization, Vasselheim.

00:53:20.216 --> 00:53:27.334
TALIESIN: I do set a bucket trap at the door just
in case. I set a bucket trap.

00:53:27.334 --> 00:53:34.443
LIAM: As everybody's trundling up the stairs, I
catch Grog alone for a second and say: let this

00:53:34.443 --> 00:53:44.217
stand as a testament to how much I love you. I'm
sorry that I shaved your beard.

00:53:44.217 --> 00:53:51.082
TRAVIS: Thank you. I don't have to kill you now.

00:53:51.082 --> 00:53:58.304
(applause)

00:53:58.304 --> 00:54:15.507
LIAM: Give him a little pinch on the cheek. Oh,
Grog, you couldn't if you tried. Now. Good night,

00:54:15.507 --> 00:54:16.548
big guy.

00:54:16.548 --> 00:54:18.249
TRAVIS: 'Night.

00:54:18.249 --> 00:54:22.178
MATT: All right. You all find yourselves in your
chambers. Anything else you wish to do before the

00:54:22.178 --> 00:54:23.593
evening comes to a close?

00:54:23.593 --> 00:54:35.436
SAM: Yes. Sorry, Matt. I know we're trying to get
to other things, but magic compels me to put on my

00:54:35.436 --> 00:54:44.515
best silk g-string, and it compels me to use the
series of tunnels that interconnect all of the rooms.

00:54:44.515 --> 00:54:46.534
TALIESIN: Oh shit! No!

00:54:46.534 --> 00:54:58.067
SAM: That only I know about. And it compels me to
sneak into Percival's room in the dead of night

00:54:58.067 --> 00:54:59.827
and crawl into bed with him.

00:54:59.827 --> 00:55:04.428
LAURA: I'm in the bed, you motherfucker!

00:55:04.428 --> 00:55:06.065
SAM: Are you in there?!

00:55:06.065 --> 00:55:08.703
LAURA: We're married!

00:55:08.703 --> 00:55:12.732
SAM: I thought it was like the 50s, where you had
two twin beds.

00:55:12.732 --> 00:55:17.616
MATT: Have you seen their gold pile?

00:55:17.616 --> 00:55:24.166
SAM: Then I guess I better be extra stealthy.

00:55:24.166 --> 00:55:27.184
MATT: Make a stealth check.

00:55:27.184 --> 00:55:29.370
SAM: Okay. I think that's going to work. Eight.

00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:37.909
(laughter)

00:55:37.909 --> 00:55:42.642
MATT: With a slight jostle, Vex'ahlia and
Percival, you both pop one eye open and glance

00:55:42.642 --> 00:55:49.535
over as what you thought at first might be a small
child crawling into your bed, scared of a midnight

00:55:49.535 --> 00:56:00.944
storm, instead find a magnificent, silk-adorned,
familiar gnome trying to wedge himself between

00:56:00.944 --> 00:56:06.066
your bodies, which is impressive, based on the
spooning position you're already in.

00:56:06.066 --> 00:56:08.537
SAM: Let it happen.

00:56:08.537 --> 00:56:21.364
TALIESIN: I reach underneath my pillow. I grab a
small copper ball. Manners.

00:56:21.364 --> 00:56:29.699
(cheering)

00:56:29.699 --> 00:56:32.722
MATT: All right. And that's a strength ability
check?

00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:34.785
TALIESIN: That's a strength check, I believe.

00:56:34.785 --> 00:56:35.840
SAM: Just a check?

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:37.538
MATT: Is it a check or saving throw? That's the
distinction now.

00:56:37.538 --> 00:56:40.311
TALIESIN: Where is it? It's a check, not a saving
throw.

00:56:40.311 --> 00:56:42.964
SAM: Ten.

00:56:42.964 --> 00:56:44.474
TALIESIN: No.

00:56:44.474 --> 00:56:49.002
MATT: With a rapid series of clicks, whirrs and
grinding of metal, you watch as a metallic

00:56:49.002 --> 00:56:54.255
exoskeleton unwinds from the sphere, (clicking)
wraps itself around your body. You find yourself

00:56:54.255 --> 00:57:00.124
suddenly bound and held in place, unable to shift,
as these cold metal bars wrap around you like an

00:57:00.124 --> 00:57:01.694
exoskeleton.

00:57:01.694 --> 00:57:06.403
LAURA: Scanlan Shorthalt, tell me now why I
shouldn't feed you to Trinket.

00:57:06.403 --> 00:57:11.634
TALIESIN: I undo the lock so he can talk.

00:57:11.634 --> 00:57:24.994
SAM: I'm sorry! I don't know what's happening to
me. I know that this is your marital bed. Can I at

00:57:24.994 --> 00:57:36.275
least watch? I promise I won't look at you, Vex. I
won't look at you at all! I'll just be looking at

00:57:36.275 --> 00:57:37.277
Percy.

00:57:37.277 --> 00:57:43.658
LAURA: Would we know that something is wrong?

00:57:43.658 --> 00:57:47.050
TALIESIN: I rolled a one. I don't know anything's
wrong.

00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:49.537
MATT: Make an insight check on this.

00:57:49.537 --> 00:57:51.858
LAURA: What am I making? Insight. Okay.

00:57:51.858 --> 00:57:57.811
MATT: Now that you're up close and definitely
discerning his behavior.

00:57:57.811 --> 00:57:59.074
LAURA: Fucking A.

00:57:59.074 --> 00:58:00.249
TALIESIN: I rolled a one.

00:58:00.249 --> 00:58:07.068
LAURA: It's a 12, but I rolled a three.

00:58:07.068 --> 00:58:13.670
MATT: You get the sense that something's off and
different, but you think it may be a practical

00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:15.764
joke or he's just trying to fuck with you.

00:58:15.764 --> 00:58:22.807
LAURA: All I have is Lesser Restoration. Unless
you're fucking with me, I'm going to try Lesser

00:58:22.807 --> 00:58:23.830
Restoration.

00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:33.820
TALIESIN: Or we could go to his room and defile
his room. God only knows what's happened there.

00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:38.275
LAURA: Here's the thing, darling. If something is
wrong with him, and this is so out of character

00:58:38.275 --> 00:58:42.107
I'm afraid something is wrong with him-- not that
you're not completely desirable--

00:58:42.107 --> 00:58:44.031
TALIESIN: That's all I needed to hear; go on.

00:58:44.031 --> 00:58:50.720
LAURA: But he needs a good night's sleep and I'm
afraid he won't get it in this.

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.902
TALIESIN: All right.

00:58:53.902 --> 00:58:58.260
LAURA: I'm going to try Lesser Restoration on him.
I'm not sure if it'll work.

00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:03.265
TALIESIN: In case this is magical, I just want to leave
you with something.

00:59:03.265 --> 00:59:12.046
(laughter)

00:59:12.046 --> 00:59:14.867
LAURA: In case it's not, don't do that anymore.

00:59:14.867 --> 00:59:20.654
MATT: All right. You extend your hand. You
complete the incantation under your breath and

00:59:20.654 --> 00:59:24.365
begrudgingly administer a Lesser Restoration spell
onto his body. You watch as his gnomish form

00:59:24.365 --> 00:59:31.905
suddenly flashes with a brief burst of divine
energy, and as it subsides, his eyes blink and

00:59:31.905 --> 00:59:39.107
stare back to Percival with the same longing lust
that he had when he entered the room.

00:59:39.107 --> 00:59:47.037
LAURA: Well, fuck. I got nothing. Scanlan!
Seriously, this is not acceptable. Go to bed! If

00:59:47.037 --> 00:59:50.038
we let you out of this cage, will you go to bed?

00:59:50.038 --> 00:59:52.645
SAM: (muffled agreement)

00:59:52.645 --> 00:59:59.895
LAURA: I'm going to send Trinket to your room with
you, and he's going to sleep on top of you so that

00:59:59.895 --> 01:00:01.765
you will go to sleep.

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:03.830
SAM: (muffled agreement)

01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:06.217
LAURA: Yeah, let's do that.

01:00:06.217 --> 01:00:08.118
TALIESIN: Manners. (click)

01:00:08.118 --> 01:00:12.317
MATT: All right. It unlatches itself and reforms
into the iron ball that you carry at your side.

01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:17.721
Scanlan, as you fall the ground, clasping the floor
with your hands and knees, breathing heavily,

01:00:17.721 --> 01:00:23.235
still the warmth subsiding from the slight touch
that you received at Percival's fingertips. Based

01:00:23.235 --> 01:00:28.404
on the time you spent drinking, conversing,
scattering to your rooms, getting dressed and

01:00:28.404 --> 01:00:32.598
making sure you were properly prepared for this
endeavor, making your way through the tunnels

01:00:32.598 --> 01:00:43.035
stealthing in at this moment, it's right about now
that the phial wears off.

01:00:43.035 --> 01:01:06.090
SAM: Ha ha! Just a birthday prank. Is it your
birthday?

01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:07.956
LAURA and TALIESIN: No.

01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:25.292
SAM: Oh, got the date wrong. (retching) I need to
change. I have jizzed in my pants.

01:01:25.292 --> 01:01:37.279
(laughter)

01:01:37.279 --> 01:01:39.081
SAM: I'm sorry.

01:01:39.081 --> 01:01:41.103
TALIESIN: Too much information. Thank you.

01:01:41.103 --> 01:01:43.435
SAM: Have a good evening.

01:01:43.435 --> 01:01:48.041
TALIESIN: Good evening. Do you walk out the main
door?

01:01:48.041 --> 01:01:49.306
SAM: The main door.

01:01:49.306 --> 01:01:51.812
TALIESIN: Okay, so you do in fact trigger a
bucket.

01:01:51.812 --> 01:02:04.485
(laughter)

01:02:04.485 --> 01:02:08.092
TALIESIN: With a viscous powder that I mixed up.
It's basically a flour base. It's going to be a

01:02:08.092 --> 01:02:10.116
real pain to wash off.

01:02:10.116 --> 01:02:14.707
MATT: You're a ghost-white, bucket-headed gnome in
a silk g-string.

01:02:14.707 --> 01:02:20.574
LAURA: Why? Why did you do it?

01:02:20.574 --> 01:02:23.339
SAM: For the lulz?

01:02:23.339 --> 01:02:29.552
(laughter)

01:02:29.552 --> 01:02:42.783
SAM: I don't know. I'll see you in the morning.

01:02:42.783 --> 01:02:49.323
TALIESIN: I'm going to block the secret passage.
I'm going to shift some furniture.

01:02:49.323 --> 01:02:56.354
LIAM: By the way, when everyone asks me tomorrow
on social media why I did it, same answer.

01:02:56.354 --> 01:02:59.035
TALIESIN: This was good. Well done, you.

01:02:59.035 --> 01:03:05.786
MATT: After some disconcerting conversation
between the married couple and a shameful walk

01:03:05.786 --> 01:03:10.341
back to your own chambers, you eventually find
yourself coming to rest for the evening. After a

01:03:10.341 --> 01:03:16.498
full night's sleep, you find yourself with your
spells restored, your hit points restored, half

01:03:16.498 --> 01:03:25.583
your hit dice restored, and an embarrassing
morning breakfast before you. As you all come down

01:03:25.583 --> 01:03:31.633
to a fine vegan breakfast meal there on the table,
you all have conversation, start plotting and

01:03:31.633 --> 01:03:36.030
planning, and you hear the gentle footsteps of one
slowly approaching Scanlan to the breakfast

01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:37.209
table.

01:03:37.209 --> 01:03:38.920
LAURA: Oh, hey.

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:50.109
SAM: (husky) Hey. (clears throat) Didn't sleep a
lot. Sorry. Hey, Percy.

01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:55.694
TALIESIN: Hi.

01:03:55.694 --> 01:04:09.111
MARISHA: What distributor do you get your wine
from? Just curious.

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:14.514
SAM: I don't want to talk about it.

01:04:14.514 --> 01:04:17.097
LAURA: So, Vasselheim?

01:04:17.097 --> 01:04:18.200
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:28.583
MATT: All right, so finishing your meals. What do
you guys want to do? You're going to Vasselheim.

01:04:28.583 --> 01:04:29.808
How are you doing that?

01:04:29.808 --> 01:04:36.678
MARISHA: Okay. Do we have a plan before we get
there? Before I teleport us into the middle of a

01:04:36.678 --> 01:04:39.317
city that might possibly be in the middle of a war
zone?

01:04:39.317 --> 01:04:43.365
LIAM: Why don't I go see how much progress he's
made? And I stick my skull out the door again and

01:04:43.365 --> 01:04:45.303
see how far he's gotten.

01:04:45.303 --> 01:04:48.308
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

01:04:48.308 --> 01:04:51.488
LIAM: Very good. 30.

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:58.646
MATT: Okay. Listening to your senses and focusing
on the direction, still traveling. Still

01:04:58.646 --> 01:05:05.939
relatively slow pace, as far as the general
distance, but it's making headway. It's traveled

01:05:05.939 --> 01:05:08.274
throughout the night a number of miles.

01:05:08.274 --> 01:05:13.159
TALIESIN: We should at least prepare Vasselheim,
then.

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:18.079
TRAVIS: Yeah. He hasn't obviously gotten there,
right?

01:05:18.079 --> 01:05:21.945
TALIESIN: If a wrath of a dark god is on its way,
they should probably prepare themselves.

01:05:21.945 --> 01:05:24.403
MARISHA: Also, I'm assuming he's traveling with an
army.

01:05:24.403 --> 01:05:28.746
TALIESIN: We would assume. With one eye each.

01:05:28.746 --> 01:05:35.423
LAURA: Oh god. What if Vasselheim is a show of
power?

01:05:35.423 --> 01:05:39.470
TALIESIN: That would be likely.

01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:43.169
SAM: Let's hurry.

01:05:43.169 --> 01:05:44.918
TRAVIS: Where to in Vasselheim?

01:05:44.918 --> 01:05:50.215
MARISHA: How long would it take us to get out? Oh,
wait. We chartered that boat; do we care about

01:05:50.215 --> 01:05:53.584
those people?

01:05:53.584 --> 01:05:56.500
TALIESIN: Wow.

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.292
MARISHA: Or are we just going to leave them in the
middle of the ocean?

01:05:58.292 --> 01:06:02.317
LAURA: They were only going to wait for us a
couple of days, and then they were going to head back.

01:06:02.317 --> 01:06:04.481
LIAM: Yeah, they would assume we drowned.

01:06:04.481 --> 01:06:07.888
MARISHA: Okay, fair argument.

01:06:07.888 --> 01:06:12.596
MATT: Yeah, you gather that probably when they
drove a bunch of yahoos out in the middle of the

01:06:12.596 --> 01:06:17.065
ocean to dive under a volcano in the ocean that
they did not expect you to return.

01:06:17.065 --> 01:06:23.485
MARISHA: We did put a 500 gold holding deposit on,
an incidental that we will not get back.

01:06:23.485 --> 01:06:28.275
LAURA: I think the destruction of the world may be
more important than 500 gold.

01:06:28.275 --> 01:06:31.244
(shocked noises)

01:06:31.244 --> 01:06:33.419
LAURA: I know.

01:06:33.419 --> 01:06:38.012
SAM: Quick, cast Lesser Restoration on yourself!

01:06:38.012 --> 01:06:46.476
MARISHA: It would probably take us a while to get
up and out to a tree, right? I'm being a little

01:06:46.476 --> 01:06:49.025
selfish with my upper-level spells.

01:06:49.025 --> 01:06:50.328
TALIESIN: No, I feel it.

01:06:50.328 --> 01:06:56.398
TRAVIS: Up and out to it. Up the volcano, up the
water--

01:06:56.398 --> 01:07:00.370
MARISHA: Okay, you know what? Don't worry about
it, let's go. Let's just Plane Shift.

01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:02.937
MATT: That's an arduous journey back to any
possible tree.

01:07:02.937 --> 01:07:05.093
TRAVIS: Wanted to talk that one out.

01:07:05.093 --> 01:07:08.395
MARISHA: Yeah. I Plane Shift us to Vasselheim.

01:07:08.395 --> 01:07:13.648
MATT: All right, so you Plane Shift to Vasselheim.
As you guys encircle your hands once more,

01:07:13.648 --> 01:07:15.848
Keyleth, you focus on whereabouts in Vasselheim?

01:07:15.848 --> 01:07:17.117
TRAVIS: The Trial Forge?

01:07:17.117 --> 01:07:22.284
LAURA: Or Melora's tree maybe?

01:07:22.284 --> 01:07:39.651
(laughter and applause)

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:42.616
SAM: Residual magic.

01:07:42.616 --> 01:07:47.949
TRAVIS, SAM, and TALIESIN: Trial Forge?

01:07:47.949 --> 01:07:50.558
MARISHA: Where will you not get arrested?

01:07:50.558 --> 01:08:00.501
TRAVIS: No one's going to even notice me. Yeah,
they were ringing the bells and running around and

01:08:00.501 --> 01:08:08.248
getting prepared and stuff. Yeah, and if for some
reason, somebody's like, "That guy punched me in

01:08:08.248 --> 01:08:10.995
"the face," we'll just punch them.

01:08:10.995 --> 01:08:15.046
TALIESIN: I agree with this plan.

01:08:15.046 --> 01:08:16.279
MARISHA: Trial Forge.

01:08:16.279 --> 01:08:22.858
MATT: All right. With that, you close your eyes.
Beneath your breath, you recite the incantation.

01:08:22.858 --> 01:08:29.509
With that, you feel your body suddenly sucked into
a dark void and thrust through the absence of

01:08:29.509 --> 01:08:34.794
space. And within a moment's time, before you can
adjust to the sudden cold and dark vacuous void

01:08:34.794 --> 01:08:41.185
around you, your feet hit hard ground, your eyes
focus again to the light, and you glance around

01:08:41.185 --> 01:08:50.136
and the center streets, not actually directly at
the Trial Forge-- ooh, we got music, finally. In

01:08:50.136 --> 01:08:55.598
the streets around the Braving Grounds, you can
see the smokestacks from the Trial Forge over the

01:08:55.598 --> 01:09:06.278
distance. You also notice that the sky above you
is deep, dark gray clouds. It's as if there is a

01:09:06.278 --> 01:09:11.427
perpetual eclipse placed upon this ground. You
look around in all directions, and you see this

01:09:11.427 --> 01:09:19.452
roiling gray cloud cluster that encompasses the
entirety of the sky above you, which should be

01:09:19.452 --> 01:09:27.640
mid-morning or midday. It's blotted out by the
storm-- rainfall is absent-- and you see flashes

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:34.146
of light, occasionally framing strange shapes
and clouds. Whether by illusion or by a trick of

01:09:34.146 --> 01:09:43.548
your mind, you swear you see shifting darkness and
forms, images in the clouds: giant faces silently

01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:51.266
screaming, hundreds of feet across, that extend and
push out of the clouds and draw back into the sky.

01:09:51.311 --> 01:09:57.208
Massive hands that push against them, only to
slowly recede moments later. You blink and they're

01:09:57.208 --> 01:10:01.487
gone, leaving you unsettled regardless and
uncertain as to whether or not that was just you

01:10:01.487 --> 01:10:04.512
or if everyone can see this.

01:10:04.512 --> 01:10:09.617
As your focus shifts from the sky above, you look
around and you can see Bastions are stationed all

01:10:09.617 --> 01:10:16.186
across the perimeter walls of Vasselheim. You see
large ballistae mounted and armed as watchers

01:10:16.186 --> 01:10:21.628
scour the distant horizon on all sides looking for
any sign of something in the distance making its

01:10:21.628 --> 01:10:27.175
way towards the city, based on the warning you
previously gave. Unlit beacons sit at every major

01:10:27.175 --> 01:10:32.029
structure and juncture of the stone walls,
awaiting the burning sign that an assault is

01:10:32.029 --> 01:10:39.078
spotted. Militia and armored guard move with haste
to stations across the city quarters. You can feel

01:10:39.078 --> 01:10:42.932
the air of war permeating the streets.

01:10:42.932 --> 01:10:47.647
The streets are far emptier than you recall, the
stragglers returning to their homes with carts

01:10:47.647 --> 01:10:55.513
full of rations, produce, and weapons. Fear grips
their face as they pass by. You glance off to your

01:10:55.513 --> 01:11:01.378
left, and you can see a wiry old man in the
corner, his tangled silver and blond hair

01:11:01.378 --> 01:11:07.881
bouncing with fervor, as he shouts out, "The
reckoning of our opulence has come! The gods are

01:11:07.881 --> 01:11:13.098
"away and the price of our hubris comes to consume
us." But no one's paying him mind. His tattered

01:11:13.098 --> 01:11:18.373
bones jangling his knees across each other, as he
makes his way through the streets, his face a

01:11:18.373 --> 01:11:21.215
glance of utter despair.

01:11:21.215 --> 01:11:27.408
You notice an argument between two Bastions and a
middle-aged bearded man who is painting a familiar

01:11:27.408 --> 01:11:31.946
symbol on his front door, not too far from where
you stand. A five-year-old girl cries and clings

01:11:31.946 --> 01:11:35.886
to his leg. What do you do?

01:11:35.886 --> 01:11:38.835
TALIESIN: What is the symbol?

01:11:38.835 --> 01:11:41.271
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:11:41.271 --> 01:11:45.719
TALIESIN: I'll make a perception check. Let's see
if you'll roll a one again. No, that's much

01:11:45.719 --> 01:11:49.702
better. 28.

01:11:49.702 --> 01:11:57.479
MATT: Glancing at this distance, you see a
familiar and striking shape. It is a haphazardly

01:11:57.479 --> 01:12:05.531
drawn circle with dark, reddish purple paint and
a small line and a pronged fork of four prongs

01:12:05.531 --> 01:12:08.005
painted up against this wall.

01:12:08.005 --> 01:12:09.545
MARISHA: Oh, hell no.

01:12:09.545 --> 01:12:12.253
LAURA: He's painting it on the door? The guy in
the city is?

01:12:12.253 --> 01:12:14.554
MATT: The father figure.

01:12:14.554 --> 01:12:17.049
LIAM: Yeah. It could be to pass over their house.

01:12:17.049 --> 01:12:18.045
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:12:18.045 --> 01:12:19.918
MARISHA: Pass over?

01:12:19.918 --> 01:12:21.884
LAURA: That's the Vecna symbol, right?

01:12:21.884 --> 01:12:27.727
MATT: Sensing the distance of Vecna, he's still
far to the northwest of here. But what was once a

01:12:27.727 --> 01:12:38.432
few hundred miles is now shortened, about two
hundred or so, and getting lesser and lesser.

01:12:38.432 --> 01:12:41.067
LAURA: Fuck. Should we go up and talk to that
guy?

01:12:41.067 --> 01:12:45.303
MARISHA: Maybe one of us. Maybe not all of us.

01:12:45.303 --> 01:12:46.423
LAURA: You there.

01:12:46.423 --> 01:12:52.410
MATT: As you make the shout, you see the soldiers
are currently arguing with him. One says, "You

01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:55.746
"welcome this rubbish? Are you one of them kook
believers?"

01:12:55.746 --> 01:13:02.283
And the father is angrily staring in his face and
says, "You mind your business. I have no love for

01:13:02.283 --> 01:13:05.121
"this, but if these dreams are true, I must protect
my family."

01:13:05.121 --> 01:13:06.887
LAURA: Dreams?

01:13:06.887 --> 01:13:08.999
MATT: They turn and look at you as you approach.

01:13:08.999 --> 01:13:10.961
LAURA: What dreams?

01:13:10.961 --> 01:13:15.430
MATT: The soldiers take a step back with a look of
recognition across you as you step forward with

01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:22.319
your white dragon scale armor. They know not to
approach and there is seemingly a sense of knowing

01:13:22.319 --> 01:13:27.539
who you are, at least from the legends that are
told amongst the streets of Vasselheim. The father

01:13:27.539 --> 01:13:35.676
turns to you and seeing your lordly approach, and
strong voice, immediately. "The nightmares I've

01:13:35.676 --> 01:13:47.317
"had, and I'm not the first. This symbol. It scares
me, but if something comes like they say it is, I

01:13:47.317 --> 01:13:51.896
"must it let it know we have no quarrel. To
leave my family be."

01:13:51.896 --> 01:13:54.603
LAURA: This symbol will not protect you.

01:13:54.603 --> 01:13:55.944
MATT: "How do you know this?"

01:13:55.944 --> 01:14:04.302
LAURA: Because I know his followers. They won't
have mercy. They'll gouge out eyes, remove your

01:14:04.302 --> 01:14:07.277
hand, and make you one of them.

01:14:07.277 --> 01:14:09.109
MATT: Make a persuasion check, please.

01:14:09.109 --> 01:14:19.465
LAURA: Okay. Hold on. 17?

01:14:19.465 --> 01:14:29.018
MATT: Okay, he looks at you for a moment, his eyes
keen with fear, and his face. "You're certain of

01:14:29.018 --> 01:14:30.327
"this, my lady?"

01:14:30.327 --> 01:14:32.106
LAURA: Yes.

01:14:32.106 --> 01:14:35.545
MATT: "Will you protect us, then?"

01:14:35.545 --> 01:14:39.165
LAURA: We'll do our best. That's what we're here
for.

01:14:39.165 --> 01:14:45.054
MATT: He looks past you, the rest of your
companions, all looking well-armed and definitely

01:14:45.054 --> 01:14:52.963
capable. Looks down and rubs the hair of his
little girl, her sandy blonde hair curled up and a

01:14:52.963 --> 01:15:02.355
bit dirtied. Looking down from her gaze, up to
you, he says, "Then I trust you." He takes the

01:15:02.355 --> 01:15:06.139
tattered paintbrush he was using and smears across
the symbol, destroying it.

01:15:06.139 --> 01:15:16.248
(applause)

01:15:16.248 --> 01:15:18.895
LAURA: Dear god, I hope that works.

01:15:18.895 --> 01:15:28.675
MATT: He goes inside with his daughter. Before he
closes the door: "Thank you. Please, help." Pulls

01:15:28.675 --> 01:15:31.495
the rest of the cart in and closes the door behind
with a slam.

01:15:31.495 --> 01:15:37.834
The two guards awkwardly look at each other and
back to you. "Thank you."

01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:50.745
(laughter)

01:15:50.745 --> 01:15:53.806
MATT: "Be safe." And they both wander off.

01:15:53.806 --> 01:15:56.676
LAURA: I don't think they noticed you, Grog.

01:15:56.676 --> 01:15:59.035
TRAVIS: Man, I'm fucking slick.

01:15:59.035 --> 01:16:06.723
MATT: Knowing the location, you're not that far
from the Quadroads juncture between the different

01:16:06.723 --> 01:16:12.194
areas. You can go further towards the Trial Forge
or back towards the center of where the Quadroads

01:16:12.194 --> 01:16:17.180
meets between that and where the Platinum
Sanctuary and Platinum Dragon section is. There is

01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:23.950
the temple to Sarenrae, where you left Pike
previously. What do you wish to do?

01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:27.734
MARISHA: Is the crazy zealot still running
around?

01:16:27.734 --> 01:16:32.211
MATT: Yeah. He seems to be scattered through the
streets. He's maybe 60 feet away, still shouting

01:16:32.211 --> 01:16:35.608
obscenities and weird doom-saying prophecies.

01:16:35.608 --> 01:16:37.627
MARISHA: I walk up to him.

01:16:37.627 --> 01:16:45.359
MATT: Okay. As he's shouting this time, "He will
come! He will destroy us! You! He will destroy

01:16:45.359 --> 01:16:48.589
"you, too! I've seen it! I've seen it."

01:16:48.589 --> 01:16:51.942
MARISHA: Yeah. I believe you. I've seen it, too.

01:16:51.942 --> 01:16:56.917
MATT: "Good! Then save yourself! Run! Run far!"

01:16:56.917 --> 01:17:00.487
MARISHA: Wait. How did he talk to you?

01:17:00.487 --> 01:17:09.062
MATT: "In my mind. In my dreams. He comes. He says
it's inevitable. The clouds, they come as the

01:17:09.062 --> 01:17:13.628
"first warning. The first seal broken. The sky has
already left us. The sun is gone!"

01:17:13.628 --> 01:17:20.672
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah, no. Accurate.

01:17:20.672 --> 01:17:33.416
MATT: "Beware the Undying King!" And he goes to
run off, away.

01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:35.499
LAURA: Is he already gone?

01:17:35.499 --> 01:17:37.228
MATT: He's running away.

01:17:37.228 --> 01:17:40.423
MARISHA: Man, I don't know how to deal with that
type of abrasive personality.

01:17:40.423 --> 01:17:47.651
LAURA: Maybe it's best to not let people give him
power, because the more people believe in him, the

01:17:47.651 --> 01:17:49.197
stronger of a god he becomes.

01:17:49.197 --> 01:17:56.286
MARISHA: But that guy resisted. He knew when
others didn't. And he was crazy.

01:17:56.286 --> 01:18:01.037
LAURA: Could you maybe make the sun reappear?

01:18:01.037 --> 01:18:12.715
MARISHA: I don't know. Can I do a nature check to
see if this is above my capabilities?

01:18:12.715 --> 01:18:21.667
MATT: It's definitely an unnatural form of weather
pattern. You get the sense that this is itself a

01:18:21.667 --> 01:18:23.178
minor miracle.

01:18:23.178 --> 01:18:25.134
MARISHA: A minor miracle?

01:18:25.134 --> 01:18:30.961
MATT: Well, yeah. The sky that stretches beyond
all sides of the horizon is of similar strange,

01:18:30.961 --> 01:18:33.481
roiling cloud doom.

01:18:33.481 --> 01:18:35.527
LAURA: Is it like Ghostbusters?

01:18:35.527 --> 01:18:41.206
MATT: It's very similar, yeah. We're talking top
of the tower, curling ink clouds out to each side,

01:18:41.206 --> 01:18:47.144
traveling with vast speed in almost all
directions. You see no plain, single path in which

01:18:47.144 --> 01:18:49.110
they're traveling. They're emanating.

01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:52.512
MARISHA: This seems like a minor miracle.

01:18:52.512 --> 01:18:56.638
LAURA: Yeah. Can you miracle more?

01:18:56.638 --> 01:19:06.526
MARISHA: I could maybe try to carve out a patch of
sunlight above us, but I don't think it would be

01:19:06.526 --> 01:19:09.260
anything more than a morale boost, at this point.

01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:11.027
TALIESIN: If we did it at a temple, perhaps.

01:19:11.027 --> 01:19:13.180
LAURA: Maybe above the Sarenrae temple.

01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:16.650
LIAM: He's bearing down on us. We need to tell
Pike. We need to warn the authorities. We need to

01:19:16.650 --> 01:19:19.368
tell the Temple of Bahamut, the Slayer's Take.

01:19:19.368 --> 01:19:25.408
MARISHA: We have to keep people from defecting to
him. The more people that he has, the more of his

01:19:25.408 --> 01:19:30.374
symbols that get spread around out of fear, the
more he'll win.

01:19:30.374 --> 01:19:35.897
TRAVIS: Right, but we can only either spread the
word that we're going to resist or spread the word

01:19:35.897 --> 01:19:38.869
that it's about time to fight. We can only do one
or the other.

01:19:38.869 --> 01:19:41.422
LIAM: He's coming, one way or another.

01:19:41.422 --> 01:19:44.626
MARISHA: I turn to one of the guards of
Vasselheim.

01:19:44.626 --> 01:19:47.992
MATT: One of them's rushing past. He has a cluster
of spears under one arm.

01:19:47.992 --> 01:19:49.086
MARISHA: Sir!

01:19:49.086 --> 01:19:50.230
MATT: "Yes?"

01:19:50.230 --> 01:19:56.280
MARISHA: If there was a universal sign of
Vasselheim, a symbol of Vasselheim, or a sign to

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:58.697
fight, what would it be?

01:19:58.697 --> 01:20:06.243
(laughter)

01:20:06.243 --> 01:20:14.776
MATT: "There is no universal symbol. There are
many symbols in Vasselheim. All the various

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:17.333
"divinities that lie here have their own symbol."

01:20:17.333 --> 01:20:23.272
MARISHA: Okay. I didn't know if there was like a
rally or cry or something that you all universally

01:20:23.272 --> 01:20:28.561
believed in. There's got to be something, a symbol
of Vasselheim.

01:20:28.561 --> 01:20:31.627
MATT: "Vasselheim is a divided and united city as
one."

01:20:31.627 --> 01:20:36.552
MARISHA: All right, you know what? Never mind!
Jeez, your politics.

01:20:36.552 --> 01:20:51.263
MATT: He gives a strange glint of a glare towards
your larger goliath friend. Right as he begins to

01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:57.158
squint, you hear a voice in the distance go,
"Lieutenant, we need you!"

01:20:57.158 --> 01:20:59.651
"Right away." And he rushes off with spears under
his arm.

01:20:59.651 --> 01:21:08.657
MARISHA: Thanks, Lieutenant, for nothing. Okay,
maybe some sort of sign will help them.

01:21:08.657 --> 01:21:12.227
TALIESIN: If we're going to make a sun appear--

01:21:12.227 --> 01:21:14.268
LAURA: Let's do it at the temple of Sarenrae or
the temple of Pelor.

01:21:14.268 --> 01:21:16.283
MARISHA: All right, we go to the temple of
Sarenrae!

01:21:16.283 --> 01:21:22.108
MATT: You make your way to the temple. You enter
the interior, and you can see most everyone is in

01:21:22.108 --> 01:21:28.906
silent prayer. They're all either holding hands or
clutching close their smaller kin, these renewed

01:21:28.906 --> 01:21:38.737
worshippers of the Everlight. Glancing around, you
don't see Pike currently in the vicinity. All you

01:21:38.737 --> 01:21:43.801
see is one of the head priests, Coraline, who's
currently off to the side is tending to a few of

01:21:43.801 --> 01:21:48.109
the folks from the interior.

01:21:48.109 --> 01:21:49.460
LIAM: (shouting) Pike?

01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:54.700
MATT: Coraline looks over and sees you guys enter.
"Oh!" Rushes up to you. "I'm sorry, she's not

01:21:54.700 --> 01:22:00.748
"here, she went to the Platinum Sanctuary.
Apparently, there's a discussion, a meeting of

01:22:00.748 --> 01:22:02.122
"some kind."

01:22:02.122 --> 01:22:03.107
MARISHA: Right now?

01:22:03.107 --> 01:22:04.885
MATT: "Right now. She left not but an hour ago."

01:22:04.885 --> 01:22:05.809
MARISHA: Okay, go!

01:22:05.809 --> 01:22:06.819
LIAM: Thank you.

01:22:06.819 --> 01:22:07.948
MATT: "Of course."

01:22:07.948 --> 01:22:17.609
(laughter)

01:22:17.609 --> 01:22:23.624
MATT: Walking up the endless stair along the side of
the mountain that signifies the northern end of

01:22:23.624 --> 01:22:28.870
Vasselheim, you see small units of silver and blue
armored warriors of the Platinum Dragon descend

01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:34.332
past you, rushing and giving you a sidelong glance
as they do. A nod of recognition as some of them

01:22:34.332 --> 01:22:36.962
recognize you upon your approach.

01:22:36.962 --> 01:22:43.192
Eventually, through an exhausting ascent and
seeing the clouds growing darker and darker, you

01:22:43.192 --> 01:22:47.445
begin to see that there is, from this vantage
point, a very slight shift in their direction.

01:22:47.445 --> 01:22:50.756
They seem to be coming from the northwest.

01:22:50.756 --> 01:22:57.761
You eventually reach the base of the massive
pillars that mark the stronghold's entrance, where

01:22:57.761 --> 01:23:03.868
you've been a number of times before. You
immediately notice a crowd of mixed attire. You

01:23:03.868 --> 01:23:11.910
see Scalebearers standing tensely along various
Bastion members. You see warriors of the Dawn Fist

01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:20.403
in their gold and red robes. And you see soldiers
of brass and sapphire: the Hand of Ord is here, as

01:23:20.403 --> 01:23:31.979
well. Now, upon approaching the guards. The guards
at the front gate see you and expectantly signify

01:23:31.979 --> 01:23:39.368
for the gates to open with a shifting (thudding).
The two large marble doorways open inside, just

01:23:39.368 --> 01:23:41.889
enough for you to pass within.

01:23:41.889 --> 01:23:47.361
You enter the central chambers, the inner sanctum
of the Platinum Sanctuary, where the marble halls

01:23:47.361 --> 01:23:53.908
lead to the familiar circular forum chambers where
you last met with the Highbearer Vord, the

01:23:53.908 --> 01:24:02.025
Silver-Touched, who stands there before you, among
his guard, in heated discussion. The room is

01:24:02.025 --> 01:24:06.620
lively with representatives of each temple
clustered behind their highest lord. The red-robed

01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:14.610
Dawn Fist of Kord flank Earthbreaker Groon.
Philosophers gather near Holy Curator Curtis Uleas

01:24:14.610 --> 01:24:21.017
of the Quadroads of Erathis. The Gladekeepers of
the Birthheart stand behind the High Hierophant

01:24:21.017 --> 01:24:29.583
Ophera, while the dark-veiled maidens of the Raven
Queen gather, leaderless, as is their order. Pike

01:24:29.583 --> 01:24:34.047
stands at the edge of the council, trying to
listen in, before seeing you and rushing to your

01:24:34.047 --> 01:24:37.198
side. (panting) "Hi!"

01:24:37.198 --> 01:24:39.439
TRAVIS: Pike!

01:24:39.439 --> 01:24:45.289
MATT: She rushes in and gives a few quick hugs.
"Did it work? Did you do it?"

01:24:45.289 --> 01:24:49.002
TRAVIS: Yeah! (whispering) We got the stuff.

01:24:49.002 --> 01:24:51.370
LAURA: (whispering) We made them!

01:24:51.370 --> 01:24:58.183
MATT: "Good. Things are a bit tense." And as she
turns, you see now at the back of the council,

01:24:58.183 --> 01:25:04.755
towering over most others and without armed
support stands the dark-skinned, beautiful J'mon

01:25:04.755 --> 01:25:16.930
Sa Ord, their simple clothing swathed in a loose
hanging robe of gold and sky blue. J'mon's

01:25:16.930 --> 01:25:22.985
smoldering pupils shift in your direction, and
they give you a nod of respect. The discussions

01:25:22.985 --> 01:25:29.941
halt as you approach, recognition also falling
across the room. At which point, the Highbearer

01:25:29.941 --> 01:25:39.233
Vord turns to you saying, "Vox Machina, with a gift
of timing. Have you anything to aid in this crisis?"

01:25:39.233 --> 01:25:42.514
LAURA: Like, so much.

01:25:42.514 --> 01:25:50.651
MATT: "Then please, take the center of the
chambers. I believe everyone here could use some

01:25:50.651 --> 01:25:56.096
"form of good news." He steps back, and as the rest
of the guards empty, they open the central space

01:25:56.096 --> 01:25:58.463
of the chamber for you to approach.

01:25:58.463 --> 01:26:05.354
TALIESIN: Well, technically we've already been
observable, so there's very little that we can say

01:26:05.354 --> 01:26:06.810
that he doesn't already know.

01:26:06.810 --> 01:26:08.674
LAURA: He's listening right now.

01:26:08.674 --> 01:26:10.754
LIAM: How much do you know already?

01:26:10.754 --> 01:26:15.792
MATT: "We have only taken a bit from what your
companion here, Pike of the Everlight, has said.

01:26:15.792 --> 01:26:19.166
"You went off to a volcano?"

01:26:19.166 --> 01:26:22.034
TRAVIS: Scaldseat.

01:26:22.034 --> 01:26:24.579
MARISHA: And we defeated it!

01:26:24.579 --> 01:26:28.203
MATT: "You defeated a volcano?"

01:26:28.203 --> 01:26:29.602
TRAVIS: No.

01:26:29.602 --> 01:26:31.060
MARISHA: Kind of.

01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:39.264
LAURA: Look, I'm sure you've realized by this
point that Vecna has ascended to godhood.

01:26:39.264 --> 01:26:47.571
MATT: As he begins to speak, immediately the High
Hierophant Ophera steps forward. "Yes, the dreams

01:26:47.571 --> 01:26:55.611
"have spread. We've seen and spoken with the
clerics all across this land, and it seems that a

01:26:55.611 --> 01:27:01.765
"new force has shoved its way amongst the rest of
the pantheon, though apparently closer."

01:27:01.765 --> 01:27:09.894
LAURA: He's not reached his full power yet. The
only way it will happen is if he claims a great

01:27:09.894 --> 01:27:12.472
use of power.

01:27:12.472 --> 01:27:17.332
MARISHA: Yeah, performs a miracle. He needs
followers.

01:27:17.332 --> 01:27:21.941
LAURA: He's on his way here. The more followers he
has, the more power he has.

01:27:21.941 --> 01:27:26.804
MATT: At that, when you say, "he's on his way
here," you watch as Groon steps forward, arms

01:27:26.804 --> 01:27:32.826
still crossed. "How do you know he's coming?"

01:27:32.826 --> 01:27:39.624
MARISHA: (stammers) Just look outside.

01:27:39.624 --> 01:27:45.025
TRAVIS: Keyleth, hey, whoa. Take it down.

01:27:45.025 --> 01:27:49.910
SAM: We don't need the sass.

01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:52.444
MARISHA: But I'm not sassing!

01:27:52.444 --> 01:27:59.946
TRAVIS: With respect, there are those among us
that can tell where he is moving.

01:27:59.946 --> 01:28:01.387
LAURA: Yeah.

01:28:01.387 --> 01:28:03.555
LIAM: I am the paladin of the Raven Queen.

01:28:03.555 --> 01:28:11.981
MATT: At which point two of the maidens behind you
say in unison together, "That he is, and the

01:28:11.981 --> 01:28:17.614
"visions we've seen, as well. The pretender god.
His words, channeled through prayers, speak of a

01:28:17.614 --> 01:28:25.106
"new terror, a vile tyrant unchecked. Believe him.
His words are that of our lady." And both of them

01:28:25.106 --> 01:28:27.305
step back once more.

01:28:27.305 --> 01:28:29.244
MARISHA: Have you met them before?

01:28:29.244 --> 01:28:31.077
MATT: They said it in unison.

01:28:31.077 --> 01:28:35.568
MARISHA: Are you friends? Are you on the same
mailing list?

01:28:35.568 --> 01:28:39.771
LIAM: They all look similar.

01:28:39.771 --> 01:28:45.435
LAURA: So yeah, he's got this ability.

01:28:45.435 --> 01:28:52.930
LIAM: She has granted me knowledge of his
whereabouts, and he is coming fast.

01:28:52.930 --> 01:29:01.179
MATT: Vord now speaks up from behind. "Good, then
let us gather our resources. The esteemed J'mon Sa

01:29:01.179 --> 01:29:04.757
"Ord has agreed to lend aid and resources to our
defense."

01:29:04.757 --> 01:29:11.512
At which point, J'mon speaks up. "This threat
stretches beyond the borders of Issylra. The

01:29:11.512 --> 01:29:18.668
"clouds darken even our desert skies. If this
specter of the Age of Arcanum has indeed ascended,

01:29:18.668 --> 01:29:25.449
"as the clerics here are convinced, then it is a
threat that we of Ank'Harel cannot ignore."

01:29:25.449 --> 01:29:35.251
Vord then turns his head frustratingly to the east
and says, "And King Bertrand Dwendal has declined

01:29:35.295 --> 01:29:41.206
"aid, claiming that until this rumored scourge
arrives on Dwendalian soil, it is of no interest

01:29:41.206 --> 01:29:49.913
"to the crown of Wildemount. No resources can be
spared chasing whispers. We have sent out scouting

01:29:49.913 --> 01:29:54.946
"parties, however. As you've said, this threat
seems to be coming from the northwest, last you

01:29:54.946 --> 01:30:01.222
"came through. And wyvern riders are seeking the
location of this Thar Amphala."

01:30:01.222 --> 01:30:09.131
At which point, there's a flash of blue arcane
energy in the back of the room. Everyone turns;

01:30:09.131 --> 01:30:15.862
the guards have their weapons drawn out ready. And
you spin to see a familiar blonde-haired mage with

01:30:15.862 --> 01:30:17.132
braids on the side--

01:30:17.132 --> 01:30:21.353
(cheering)

01:30:21.353 --> 01:30:37.302
MATT: A bit out of breath, and in the same flash
behind, a golden-armored halfling of sun-kissed

01:30:37.302 --> 01:30:48.166
skin and long, golden, curling hair. Large weapon
dragging behind. Allura then, hand up in

01:30:48.166 --> 01:30:56.742
resignation, staff to the side. "We are merely
here to offer counsel and communication. We mean

01:30:56.742 --> 01:31:03.035
"no harm, nor to bring our arcane knowledge to your
quarters, and I apologize, but extenuating

01:31:03.035 --> 01:31:10.764
"circumstances require strange bedfellows, I think
you will agree. However, at the first sight of

01:31:10.764 --> 01:31:17.603
"threat upon Tal'Dorei, understand that we will
seek your assistance with haste, as well. Emon and

01:31:17.603 --> 01:31:24.420
"the council cannot survive another catastrophe, so
we are here to behest and ask only you're ready to

01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:28.877
"return depending on when or where this assault
strikes."

01:31:28.877 --> 01:31:37.149
There's a bit of muttering amongst the crowd and
some grumbling. Highbearer Vord nods. "We are in

01:31:37.149 --> 01:31:42.602
"need of aid and as many friends as we can gather.
You are welcome, Arcanist Vysoren."

01:31:42.602 --> 01:31:48.402
LAURA: Allura, does the sky look like this in
Emon?

01:31:48.402 --> 01:31:56.295
MATT: "It, in the past 12 hours or so, has
stretched across the Ozmit Sea and now seeks to

01:31:56.295 --> 01:32:04.833
"consume as far as the east coast of Tal'Dorei. If
this is what I believe it is, within the next

01:32:04.833 --> 01:32:11.597
"half-to-full day the entirety of Exandria will be
under the shaded sky of Vecna."

01:32:11.597 --> 01:32:22.571
SAM: Well, maybe the miracle thing is just the
change in weather, and we'll be okay.

01:32:22.571 --> 01:32:31.094
(laughter)

01:32:31.094 --> 01:32:34.707
SAM: Not all miracles have to be deadly.

01:32:34.707 --> 01:32:45.650
MATT: "Very well. Will you be there fighting with
our armies, in the front line?"

01:32:45.650 --> 01:32:53.133
TRAVIS: We will. I guess my only question is: do
we wait for him to come to us, or do we try to

01:32:53.133 --> 01:32:55.414
take the fight to him?

01:32:55.414 --> 01:33:02.223
MATT: "I do not wish to fight him where he expects
it. As we are a city that has prided itself on its

01:33:02.223 --> 01:33:10.709
"impenetrable defenses, I can guarantee you that
this entity has seemingly procured, or cleverly

01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:19.516
"divined, some way of breaching. I gather he would
expect less us bringing it to him. We hoped to

01:33:19.516 --> 01:33:24.355
"have information on the whereabouts of this city
directly. What else do we have?"

01:33:24.355 --> 01:33:28.225
LAURA: We have the knowledge that we can't take
him by surprise.

01:33:28.225 --> 01:33:31.825
MATT: "What do you mean?"

01:33:31.825 --> 01:33:33.680
LAURA: He sees everything.

01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:35.335
TALIESIN: He hears everything.

01:33:35.335 --> 01:33:39.235
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's been spying on us for quite
some time now, little shit.

01:33:39.235 --> 01:33:42.304
MARISHA: I wouldn't be surprised if there is a spy
in this room.

01:33:42.304 --> 01:33:45.406
TALIESIN: Or at least an open ear.

01:33:45.406 --> 01:33:53.496
MARISHA: You have citizens of your city that are
starting to paint his symbol on their doors out of

01:33:53.496 --> 01:34:03.263
fear. This is the last thing you want in the
middle of this crisis. All time spent with any

01:34:03.263 --> 01:34:11.412
volunteer hands need to be from any spare clerics
who can help calm the minds of the afraid.

01:34:11.412 --> 01:34:17.300
MATT: He looks out amongst the rest of the crowd
that has gathered here in the center inner

01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:28.545
sanctum. "Her words speak true. If he's indeed
seeking to undermine the worship of this city, and

01:34:28.545 --> 01:34:39.715
"as such break the defenses of our great creators,
then we need whatever strength your temples have

01:34:39.715 --> 01:34:45.195
"here, calming the people of Vasselheim and beyond.
If you think he sees all--"

01:34:45.195 --> 01:34:49.292
TALIESIN: I think he sees this city as a ripe
audience.

01:34:49.292 --> 01:35:07.578
MATT: At this point, you watch as Vord steps
forward, fiddling with one finger. "Long ago, this

01:35:07.578 --> 01:35:17.870
"grand temple nearly fell to the prying minds of
terrible mages. This here," and he pulls a ring

01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:26.842
from his finger, "is called the Band of Shrouds, a
powerful implement of the Highbearer to shunt

01:35:26.842 --> 01:35:40.287
"these prying magics aside. I lend it to you for
the coming struggle." And he passes it over to

01:35:40.287 --> 01:35:46.827
Vex'ahlia.

01:35:46.827 --> 01:35:49.726
LAURA: Yes!

01:35:49.726 --> 01:35:57.982
MATT: "Kept close enough to the one who wears this
ring, I doubt even his newly born eyes could

01:35:57.982 --> 01:36:09.206
"pierce it. However, it can only affect those
nearby, so if you are to strike, perhaps it's best

01:36:09.206 --> 01:36:12.517
"you do so away from his vision, and we distract."

01:36:12.517 --> 01:36:16.936
LAURA: So he can't hear us right now?

01:36:16.936 --> 01:36:21.989
MATT: Everyone in the room takes a few steps
closer to you.

01:36:21.989 --> 01:36:25.271
(laughter)

01:36:25.271 --> 01:36:30.560
MATT: "Within this chamber, it seems so, yes."

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:34.319
LAURA: (sighs) It feels so good!

01:36:34.319 --> 01:36:38.982
LIAM: I think that would look better on your
middle finger, darling.

01:36:38.982 --> 01:36:43.013
LAURA: Oh, good call.

01:36:43.013 --> 01:36:49.181
MATT: At which point the doors in the back of the
chamber burst open once more, and you watch as two

01:36:49.181 --> 01:36:57.008
armored figures come rushing up out of breath.
(panting) You see as these two wyvern riders,

01:36:57.008 --> 01:37:03.665
recognizing their armor with the horns and the
large dragon-like build of their armor and

01:37:03.665 --> 01:37:10.017
headpiece, looking damaged and splashed with
crimson, come charging in. One of them, the helmet

01:37:10.017 --> 01:37:16.626
is removed and you see a young man shouting
through his wounded breaths. "Highbearer! Rider

01:37:16.626 --> 01:37:26.306
"Ephatus, with Rider Marley, returning from beyond
Moldire and the Tordusk pass. We found the Dark City."

01:37:26.306 --> 01:37:30.796
Everyone immediately begins to mutter beneath
their breath. The voices begin to rise as the

01:37:30.796 --> 01:37:37.341
Highbearer puts his hand out to hush them. "It
lies within a valley a few miles into the Zenwick

01:37:37.341 --> 01:37:43.552
"Mountains. Our team attempted to infiltrate, but
an unseeable barrier protects the city grounds

01:37:43.552 --> 01:37:49.456
"from all sides. We found ourselves overrun by
errant magics and winged beasts of shadow and

01:37:49.456 --> 01:37:54.360
"hunger. Only Marley and myself survived. We were
only a scouting regiment!"

01:37:54.360 --> 01:38:03.802
At which point, the High Hierophant steps forward.
"Zenwick, of all places. Curious indeed."

01:38:03.802 --> 01:38:13.481
The Highbearer turns again. "Very well, if this is
true, we must mobilize our forces very quickly."

01:38:13.481 --> 01:38:20.480
Groon steps forward once more. "We can push our
ground troops along the Glasswalk Road, towards

01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:22.232
"the range."

01:38:22.232 --> 01:38:29.981
Allura steps forward to join the conversation. "If
we can choose some elite select numbers for an

01:38:29.981 --> 01:38:32.723
"onsite assault, I can transport them."

01:38:32.723 --> 01:38:39.995
At which point the Curator Curtis steps in.
"You'll do nothing of the kind! It is arcane

01:38:39.995 --> 01:38:45.675
"perversions that enabled this madman, and we will
&lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; allow--"

01:38:45.675 --> 01:38:51.668
Ophera steps forward, putting her hand in front of
his face now, saying, "We have druids who are

01:38:51.668 --> 01:38:57.711
"familiar with the woods surrounding the base of
the Zenwick Mountains. We could transport you to

01:38:57.711 --> 01:39:01.130
"those trees, a number of you, for an initial
assault while the rest of our ground forces

01:39:01.130 --> 01:39:03.529
"assemble northward."

01:39:03.529 --> 01:39:13.873
At which point, the wounded rider speaks up,
loudly. "I am not done! My apologies. Only Marley

01:39:13.873 --> 01:39:20.383
"and myself survived with one of our wyverns. As we
fled over the nearest mountaintop as fast as we

01:39:20.383 --> 01:39:22.727
"could, Marley saw--"

01:39:22.727 --> 01:39:28.668
And the other one takes her helmet off, and you
can see caked with blood, one eye swollen shut and

01:39:28.668 --> 01:39:40.101
a giant wound across the face. "I saw the city
move, part of it. It moved, I swear it. I heard a

01:39:40.101 --> 01:39:51.899
"rumble over the winds, looked past and back over
our shoulders, and I saw the city begin to rise."

01:39:51.899 --> 01:39:58.623
Silence takes the room. I would like any of you
with a fair amount of history to make a history check.

01:39:58.623 --> 01:40:04.371
TALIESIN: What's a fair amount?

01:40:04.371 --> 01:40:08.073
MATT: If you feel confident in your ability to
understand history. I would say putting it this

01:40:08.073 --> 01:40:11.360
way, those who have researched the lands that
would probably be Percival and Scanlan.

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:17.899
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:40:17.899 --> 01:40:22.811
SAM: 27!

01:40:22.811 --> 01:40:24.052
TALIESIN: 21.

01:40:24.052 --> 01:40:35.291
MATT: 27? Okay! I'll make part of this a whisper.

01:40:35.291 --> 01:40:38.446
LAURA: Wait, you'll make what? I didn't hear it!

01:40:38.446 --> 01:40:39.862
SAM: A &lt;i&gt;live&lt;/i&gt; whisper.

01:40:39.862 --> 01:40:46.240
MATT: There are two places in the Zenwick
Mountains that would be of any interest, or

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:54.025
historical lore-based elements. There is the
Crypts of Thomara: it's a subterranean vault city,

01:40:54.025 --> 01:41:02.057
built around a precious metal vein cluster by the
xenophobic dwarven Thomara clan in the early years

01:41:02.057 --> 01:41:08.708
of the Age of Arcana. It's said a terrible madness
fed into their greed, leading to eventual

01:41:08.708 --> 01:41:15.396
cannibalism and collapse of the society thousands
of years ago. It's now considered cursed and is

01:41:15.396 --> 01:41:23.936
largely avoided. The other location is known as
the Silted Veil, a small, cold valley within the

01:41:23.936 --> 01:41:29.014
mountains that is comprised of ice-dusted, mineral-rich
mud that was once rumored to carry natural

01:41:29.014 --> 01:41:33.815
healing properties when applied to wounds and
restorative elements to aged skin. However, a

01:41:33.815 --> 01:41:38.779
large variety of dangerous creatures also
discovered these features over time and moved into

01:41:38.779 --> 01:41:45.657
the valley, taking over and establishing a new
violent ecosystem based around the soothing muck.

01:41:45.657 --> 01:41:53.949
Scanlan.

01:41:53.949 --> 01:41:56.064
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey guys, so those t-shirts--

01:41:56.064 --> 01:42:00.428
(laughter)

01:42:00.428 --> 01:42:07.575
LAURA: Very true. There is Critical Role live Vox
Machina t-shirts.

01:42:07.575 --> 01:42:12.464
MARISHA: Okay so the Crypts of (stumbles over
words) Tholmeer? Crypts of Tholmayer and the

01:42:12.464 --> 01:42:13.750
Silted Veil.

01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:18.882
LAURA: Silted Veil and the Crypts of Tholmura?

01:42:18.882 --> 01:42:22.954
MARISHA: Yeah, which are the two places in the
Zenwick Mountains?

01:42:22.954 --> 01:42:26.391
LAURA: And one is icy valley, the other one is,
what, zombie dwarves?

01:42:26.391 --> 01:42:27.493
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:42:27.493 --> 01:42:30.553
TALIESIN: Cannibal zombie dwarves.

01:42:30.553 --> 01:42:35.216
MARISHA: Angry icy terrain or cannibal zombie
dwarves.

01:42:35.216 --> 01:42:36.034
LAURA: Okay.

01:42:36.034 --> 01:42:45.160
MATT: At this information, Vord nods. "Well, all
forces on high for impending attack here, wyvern

01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:50.745
"riders and air units, we need eyes on the Tordusk
Pass, in case the city is indeed moving as they

01:42:50.745 --> 01:42:57.047
"say. The High Hierophant will aid in transporting
advanced scouts to the base of the Zenwicks. We

01:42:57.047 --> 01:43:02.580
"would wish you be part of this if you are willing
and able. Gathering information and seeking

01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:11.337
"weakness to exploit are the key. Vox Machina, you
are our focused stealth strike force into Thar

01:43:11.337 --> 01:43:13.192
"Amphala."

01:43:13.192 --> 01:43:16.878
LAURA: Yeah! We're &lt;i&gt;mostly&lt;/i&gt; really good at that.

01:43:16.878 --> 01:43:26.431
MATT: "If you indeed carry the boons that your
lady Pike has mentioned, then we need to keep

01:43:26.431 --> 01:43:38.487
Vecna and his force occupied to grant you entry.
And we can do that. I certainly hope with the

01:43:38.487 --> 01:43:43.940
strength of our numbers that there is no way that
he can see them coming.

01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:55.764
From the distant end of the central chamber here,
a familiar voice echoes throughout the hallway.

01:43:55.764 --> 01:44:07.815
"Oh, but I do, wyrm groveler."

01:44:07.815 --> 01:44:13.668
SAM: But the ring, man! We just got the ring!

01:44:13.668 --> 01:44:15.891
MATT: You haven't attuned to it yet.

01:44:15.891 --> 01:44:18.348
LAURA: Fuck!

01:44:18.348 --> 01:44:20.532
MATT: And with that, we're going to go ahead and
take our break.

01:44:20.532 --> 01:44:28.116
(cheering)

01:44:28.116 --> 01:44:30.125
LAURA: Come on!

01:44:30.125 --> 01:44:32.578
MARISHA: What all did we say?

01:44:32.578 --> 01:44:35.454
TALIESIN: What &lt;i&gt;didn't&lt;/i&gt; we say?

01:44:35.454 --> 01:44:38.833
LAURA: Shit!

01:44:38.833 --> 01:44:40.960
LIAM: What a piece of shit!

01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:45.651
MATT: We'll take our break here. We'll return at
that moment here in a number of minutes.

01:44:45.651 --> 01:44:48.183
SAM: Ten minutes? 15 minutes? What are we doing?

01:44:48.183 --> 01:44:52.040
MATT: You'll know when the lights start going.
We'll have people out there who'll let you know.

01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:56.891
It won't be too terribly long, we need to get a
bathroom break and stuff. Anyway, be back here in

01:44:56.891 --> 01:45:01.678
a little bit, guys, we'll see you for the next
portion of our journey this evening.

01:45:01.678 --> 02:07:01.119
[break]

02:07:01.153 --> 02:07:06.574
LAURA: Fucked up because it's Trinket. It's a
Trinket cape. Yeah, but thank you. It's gorgeous.

02:07:06.574 --> 02:07:08.807
TRAVIS: Really? Right now?

02:07:08.807 --> 02:07:11.798
MARISHA: I'm rolling with someone's lucky die that
I got delivered.

02:07:11.798 --> 02:07:18.225
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Gets a little hot!

02:07:18.225 --> 02:07:20.419
LAURA: Yeah, it's warm. I'm already very warm.

02:07:20.419 --> 02:07:22.587
TALIESIN: It's a little cold up here. That's
okay.

02:07:22.587 --> 02:07:24.524
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you guys!

02:07:24.524 --> 02:07:26.837
TALIESIN: There they are.

02:07:26.837 --> 02:07:31.306
(laughter)

02:07:31.306 --> 02:07:57.369
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

02:07:57.369 --> 02:07:59.073
TRAVIS: We're missing one.

02:07:59.073 --> 02:08:02.533
SAM: Who are we missing? Why? She was just here
with a bear.

02:08:02.533 --> 02:08:04.005
TRAVIS: She's a moron!

02:08:04.005 --> 02:08:14.554
SAM: Guys, thanks for coming to the show.

02:08:14.554 --> 02:08:19.439
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Yeah!

02:08:19.439 --> 02:08:22.938
MARISHA: Hey, Matt, was there a winner?

02:08:22.938 --> 02:08:24.760
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Sam!

02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:28.384
SAM: I love Percy!

02:08:28.384 --> 02:08:32.015
(laughter)

02:08:32.015 --> 02:08:33.883
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's not over yet.

02:08:33.883 --> 02:08:35.835
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Where's Larkin?

02:08:35.835 --> 02:08:40.940
TALIESIN: Larkin is in the hearts and minds of
children.

02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:42.674
MATT: Are we up and running?

02:08:42.674 --> 02:08:43.725
TALIESIN: Are we going?

02:08:43.725 --> 02:08:45.363
MATT: Are we on the internet?

02:08:45.363 --> 02:08:49.215
MARISHA: Who's getting proposed to? All of us?!

02:08:49.215 --> 02:08:51.164
LAURA: No, I think it was to Liam.

02:08:51.164 --> 02:08:55.636
SAM: We need Brian Foster to come out here and
talk for 20 minutes and get the crowd hyped

02:08:55.636 --> 02:08:56.567
again.

02:08:56.567 --> 02:08:57.820
MATT: Yeah.

02:08:57.820 --> 02:09:06.360
(cheering)

02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:08.297
SAM: That'll work; that's fine.

02:09:08.297 --> 02:09:16.040
MATT: That'll do! All righty, looking in the back
booth, are we good? Are we online? Perfect. Welcome

02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:17.291
back, everyone.

02:09:17.291 --> 02:09:25.811
So as the inner sanctum chambers of the Platinum
Sanctuary stood silent at the recent arrival of

02:09:25.811 --> 02:09:34.322
the vision of Vecna, hovering but two feet off the
ground in all his lich-like glory. His toothy grin

02:09:34.322 --> 02:09:40.820
is immense, threatening to crack the sides of his
face. As gasps fill the chamber, armored warriors

02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:46.170
thrust spear and blade towards his illusory body,
arrows and spells passing through harmlessly and

02:09:46.170 --> 02:09:49.972
clattering, and splashing, exploding against
distant pillars across the room.

02:09:49.972 --> 02:10:00.728
The smoke subsides and he stands there untouched.
"Quite the tea party you've gathered here, Vord. I

02:10:00.728 --> 02:10:11.527
"suppose celebration is in order. After all, you
missed my re-birthday. I have something to show

02:10:11.527 --> 02:10:20.513
"you that I'm quite excited about. Don't rush the
surprise, friends. I'll bring it to you; do not

02:10:20.513 --> 02:10:30.489
"fret. You're all gathered here in one place. It
would be a perfect place for an ambush, wouldn't

02:10:30.489 --> 02:10:41.247
"you say? But where's the fun in that, when there
are so many less-protected loved ones to send my

02:10:41.247 --> 02:10:45.577
"shadows to?

02:10:45.577 --> 02:10:56.300
"Your daughter Desir, Earthbreaker, trains alone
at the Bozon Caves. An easy target. Vord of the

02:10:56.300 --> 02:11:05.126
"Platinum Dragon, your family lies behind the
double-sealed doors of your estate. I know of your

02:11:05.126 --> 02:11:14.019
"secret cellar entrance. The great protector of
Marquet's jewel is away, and your studious

02:11:14.019 --> 02:11:26.519
"concubines are left without their guard. Not to
mention all of Whitestone, or Cassandra. Young

02:11:26.519 --> 02:11:36.110
"Velora Vessar now plays with her owlbear doll, all
alone in her room."

02:11:36.110 --> 02:11:48.388
At this point, Allura shouts at the top of her
lungs, "That's enough!" And with a wave of her

02:11:48.388 --> 02:12:01.081
hand, dispels the illusion with a flash of energy,
causing it to fade, leaving only the lingering

02:12:01.081 --> 02:12:11.045
omnipresent sound of Vecna's chilling chuckle.
(chuckles) Then silence takes the room.

02:12:11.045 --> 02:12:15.930
LAURA: Vord, does this need to be attuned?

02:12:15.930 --> 02:12:18.779
(laughter)

02:12:18.779 --> 02:12:20.675
MATT: "It does."

02:12:20.675 --> 02:12:24.353
(laughter)

02:12:24.353 --> 02:12:27.020
MARISHA: Why would you take it off?!

02:12:27.020 --> 02:12:32.123
MATT: "I was gifting it to you, I didn't realize
he was going to show up in my sanctum!"

02:12:32.123 --> 02:12:40.148
LAURA: It's okay. I'm going to sit down. Keep
talking. I'm going to try to attune while that's

02:12:40.148 --> 02:12:41.470
happening.

02:12:41.470 --> 02:12:50.524
MATT: Ophera steps forward. "It's a distraction, a
bluff. We're close, and he knows it."

02:12:50.524 --> 02:12:59.247
Vord then turns to her and says, "I will not
abandon my family. Vecna knows too much, we have

02:12:59.247 --> 02:13:08.654
"no more time. Those who are primed for assault, it
begins now. Vox Machina, how do you wish to

02:13:08.654 --> 02:13:10.236
"proceed?"

02:13:10.236 --> 02:13:13.165
LAURA: Well, we can't tell you!

02:13:13.165 --> 02:13:19.084
TALIESIN: I think we proceed by taking a 15-minute
nap, really, at this point.

02:13:19.084 --> 02:13:27.966
MARISHA: What? Wait, did you make a decree and
then turn to us and say, "What's your plan?"

02:13:27.966 --> 02:13:30.264
MATT: "Yes."

02:13:30.264 --> 02:13:38.287
(laughter)

02:13:38.287 --> 02:13:46.070
MATT: "You think I haven't heard tales of your
chaotic battle strategies? I cannot &lt;i&gt;attempt&lt;/i&gt; to

02:13:46.070 --> 02:13:53.411
"ascertain the nature of how you've survived the
trials you have, so I leave that entirely up to

02:13:53.411 --> 02:13:58.482
"you. The rest &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; can handle, organize and
strategize."

02:13:58.482 --> 02:14:00.450
LAURA: You do that.

02:14:00.450 --> 02:14:07.241
MATT: As you take a moment and rest, the rest of
the individuals there begin to talk amongst

02:14:07.241 --> 02:14:12.636
themselves. The other leaders begin to set their
clerics and warriors, sending out orders to the

02:14:12.636 --> 02:14:17.650
various temples across all of Vasselheim and
beyond to prepare themselves, some for the defense

02:14:17.650 --> 02:14:22.321
of the city, and some to make their way northward
to wherever Thar Amphala will be found, head on.

02:14:22.321 --> 02:14:26.718
While this happens, and you're currently attuning
to this ring--

02:14:26.718 --> 02:14:31.077
LAURA: I'm un-attuning the Bracers of Archery in
order to attune to this ring.

02:14:31.077 --> 02:14:33.812
MATT: Okay, you're removing the Bracers of Archery
and you're attuning to the ring. That's two less

02:14:33.812 --> 02:14:35.911
damage on your ranged attacks.

02:14:35.911 --> 02:14:41.211
LAURA: Do you have a card that I can see?

02:14:41.211 --> 02:14:43.386
MARISHA: She wants that paper!

02:14:43.386 --> 02:14:44.865
LAURA: I want that paper!

02:14:44.865 --> 02:14:51.800
MATT: The ring card is in my hotel room, but you
will have it next week. But essentially what it

02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:57.543
does, while it's attuned to you and on you, within
60 feet of you at all times, divination magic is

02:14:57.543 --> 02:14:59.319
inert and cancelled.

02:14:59.319 --> 02:15:00.949
LAURA: And what's the name of it, exactly?

02:15:00.949 --> 02:15:04.727
MATT: It is called the Band of Shrouds.

02:15:04.727 --> 02:15:08.697
MARISHA: Also, the hotel printer was broken.

02:15:08.697 --> 02:15:17.316
MATT: Even getting my sheets printed out for this
game has been a whole ordeal. Thank you, Dani! As

02:15:17.316 --> 02:15:23.355
this is happening and you guys are amongst
yourselves figuring out what to do, and the rest

02:15:23.355 --> 02:15:31.476
of the crowd is murmuring, you hear the footfalls,
another, another, another, the approach of J'mon

02:15:31.476 --> 02:15:43.421
Sa Ord. "My warriors defend this city, but my
strength also lies in the front lines. If a

02:15:43.421 --> 02:15:58.644
"distraction is what you need to succeed, there are
few things as distracting as a shining dragon. I

02:15:58.644 --> 02:16:09.335
"will fly with the wyverns once Vox Machina has
been delivered, and the delivery shall be upon the

02:16:09.335 --> 02:16:11.844
"wings I bear, if you'll have me."

02:16:11.844 --> 02:16:18.316
(cheering)

02:16:18.316 --> 02:16:20.182
LAURA: Dracarys!

02:16:20.182 --> 02:16:25.489
MATT: And they give a bow and a nod.

02:16:25.489 --> 02:16:28.598
LAURA: Has it been long enough that it's attuned?

02:16:28.598 --> 02:16:33.981
MATT: Not yet, no. The rest of the people are
gathering about. You guys are, for the moment,

02:16:33.981 --> 02:16:39.850
focused inward. Pike's there with you. There is a
tension being passed around, but right now they're

02:16:39.850 --> 02:16:43.502
letting you strategize before you bring what you
have to the table. Right now, they have nothing

02:16:43.502 --> 02:16:45.223
until you have a strategy.

02:16:45.223 --> 02:16:54.682
SAM: We know of two places to go to up near the
something mountains. Zenwick Mountains?

02:16:54.682 --> 02:16:59.794
LAURA: I don't want to talk about it for a little
more time.

02:16:59.794 --> 02:17:05.654
SAM: Sure, we'll definitely stay here, then.
Definitely be here the whole time.

02:17:05.654 --> 02:17:08.212
MARISHA: You know what? We should go shopping!

02:17:08.212 --> 02:17:13.693
TRAVIS: No, fuck that! We are &lt;i&gt;not shopping!&lt;/i&gt; I'll
quit! I'll leave.

02:17:13.693 --> 02:17:15.164
MARISHA: No, Grog! No!

02:17:15.164 --> 02:17:18.184
LAURA: Maybe we should just give up.

02:17:18.184 --> 02:17:25.980
TRAVIS: What is wrong with you?! First shopping,
and now we give up. What the fuck?!

02:17:25.980 --> 02:17:30.086
LAURA: No, you know what? Vecna's right. I'm
really worried about our family. We should all

02:17:30.086 --> 02:17:32.836
split up and go be with our families right now.

02:17:32.836 --> 02:17:37.192
MARISHA: And maybe we should convert. I should
just stab myself in the eye right now.

02:17:37.192 --> 02:17:41.454
LAURA: Maybe you should! Maybe we will! Let's do
it.

02:17:41.454 --> 02:17:42.828
MARISHA: Let's do that.

02:17:42.828 --> 02:17:46.031
LIAM: Be priests of Vecna.

02:17:46.031 --> 02:17:49.842
MARISHA and SAM: Praise Vecna.

02:17:49.842 --> 02:17:51.295
TRAVIS: (shouting) What. The. Fuck?!

02:17:51.295 --> 02:17:57.484
(laughter)

02:17:57.484 --> 02:18:04.803
TRAVIS: Take it back. Now.

02:18:04.803 --> 02:18:12.462
LIAM: No, I think that's a good idea. (sizzling)
And I start pushing Whisper slowly.

02:18:12.462 --> 02:18:17.161
LAURA: No! Okay, seriously, that's too far. It's
too far, don't. I don't like it.

02:18:17.161 --> 02:18:30.693
SAM: Don't worry, he can't be killed. Just like
&lt;i&gt;all of us&lt;/i&gt; can't be killed.

02:18:30.693 --> 02:18:39.486
TRAVIS: J'mon, I'm coming with you. These people
have lost their fucking minds.

02:18:39.486 --> 02:18:47.391
MATT: "Do not worry, Grog. Be patient. I think
there is more to their words than you are-- sit

02:18:47.391 --> 02:18:59.555
"down." For the sake of brevity, as everyone is
cautiously waiting for the ring's attunement,

02:18:59.555 --> 02:19:05.612
eventually you feel the energy click as the ring
has been slipped on for this time. You feel

02:19:05.612 --> 02:19:11.271
this slight shimmer of cold wash through your body
and extend outward. At which point, you know the

02:19:11.271 --> 02:19:12.972
ring has finally been attuned.

02:19:12.972 --> 02:19:14.571
SAM: All right, we can talk freely.

02:19:14.571 --> 02:19:16.856
LIAM: Show it to us. How does it look?

02:19:16.856 --> 02:19:18.643
LAURA: It looks fucking good.

02:19:18.643 --> 02:19:20.413
TALIESIN: It looks quite nice.

02:19:20.413 --> 02:19:22.320
LAURA: It looks great, Grog.

02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:23.817
TRAVIS: Yeah, quitter.

02:19:23.817 --> 02:19:37.158
LAURA: Okay. Fuck Vecna; we're not for Vecna.
Yeah. I know! Change of heart. So we have two

02:19:37.158 --> 02:19:40.798
options, right? What were you saying, Scanlan?

02:19:40.798 --> 02:19:43.931
SAM: The Crypts of Fomora or the Silted Bale.

02:19:43.931 --> 02:19:45.988
LAURA: The Stilted Bale?

02:19:45.988 --> 02:19:47.391
SAM: The Silted Bale.

02:19:47.391 --> 02:19:50.287
MATT: Veil. It's a Veil.

02:19:50.287 --> 02:19:53.271
MARISHA: Silted Veil and the Crypts of Thromora.

02:19:53.322 --> 02:19:55.458
SAM: Fomora.

02:19:55.458 --> 02:19:57.203
MARISHA: Fromora?

02:19:57.203 --> 02:20:03.382
SAM: Sure. We know a general sense of where we're
going.

02:20:03.382 --> 02:20:07.034
LAURA: So wait, we're going there why?

02:20:07.034 --> 02:20:14.933
SAM: Those are the only places that we know within
the Zenwick Mountains that have any appeal.

02:20:14.933 --> 02:20:19.790
LAURA: Okay, so we choose between those two as our
strike place?

02:20:19.790 --> 02:20:27.932
SAM: Yes. One of them is filled with crazy dwarf
cannibals. And the other one has ice mud that can

02:20:27.932 --> 02:20:31.518
heal you.

02:20:31.518 --> 02:20:35.436
MARISHA: But has turned violent, because nature is
angry.

02:20:35.436 --> 02:20:40.392
LIAM: The druids are dropping us off at the base
of the mountain. We don't really know where either

02:20:40.392 --> 02:20:41.861
of those things are.

02:20:41.861 --> 02:20:45.211
LAURA: Maybe it's best that we don't let anyone
else know where we're going.

02:20:45.211 --> 02:20:46.806
SAM: All right, including ourselves?

02:20:46.806 --> 02:20:49.783
(laughter)

02:20:49.783 --> 02:20:52.804
SAM: I like that plan!

02:20:52.804 --> 02:20:56.221
LAURA: Yeah, because that way it'll all be a
surprise.

02:20:56.221 --> 02:20:59.131
MARISHA: Didn't he already hear our two options?

02:20:59.131 --> 02:21:01.126
MARISHA and LAURA: Did he?

02:21:01.126 --> 02:21:03.930
SAM: We don't know.

02:21:03.930 --> 02:21:05.639
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

02:21:05.639 --> 02:21:12.723
LAURA: I don't know what he heard. I don't know
how often he listens to us, I don't know any of that.

02:21:12.723 --> 02:21:20.241
MARISHA: Man, how does it work? Does he have
several lines open and he switches back and forth?

02:21:20.241 --> 02:21:22.628
LAURA: Does he have to actively listen, or is it a
passive thing?

02:21:22.628 --> 02:21:24.865
MARISHA: And how bored is this guy?

02:21:24.865 --> 02:21:28.999
LAURA: I mean that's the thing, I mean he's
building an army and trying to take over the

02:21:28.999 --> 02:21:31.222
world. I can't imagine he's listening to us all
the time.

02:21:31.222 --> 02:21:33.037
MARISHA: Yeah, he's just trolling us!

02:21:33.037 --> 02:21:36.474
LIAM: In my opinion, the gods are generally bored
and looking for things to do.

02:21:36.474 --> 02:21:40.908
LAURA: Yeah but him. He's doing things. Like he's
got shit to do.

02:21:40.908 --> 02:21:48.618
TALIESIN: I'm personally thinking that an undead
army of cannibalistic dwarves would be very

02:21:48.618 --> 02:21:56.492
appealing if I were starting an assault on a city
like this, and I would be heading my city in that

02:21:56.492 --> 02:22:05.763
direction to raise a bunch of undead cannibalistic
dwarves. That's my vibe.

02:22:05.763 --> 02:22:08.663
LIAM: So you, Percy, want to go burn them up?

02:22:08.663 --> 02:22:13.773
TALIESIN: I feel like that's where we're going to
find them, and where we'll find them preoccupied.

02:22:13.773 --> 02:22:24.790
MARISHA: But if we know that's what he would do, then
wouldn't he know that we would go to find him at

02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:27.586
what he would do?

02:22:27.586 --> 02:22:31.436
TALIESIN: You're assuming that he's going to do
what he would expect us to think he would do in

02:22:31.436 --> 02:22:33.203
the first place.

02:22:33.203 --> 02:22:38.842
LAURA: Do we know what kind of creatures are in
the icy veil? Could there be ice giants there?

02:22:38.842 --> 02:22:40.243
Would Vecna want ice giants?

02:22:40.243 --> 02:22:43.289
MARISHA: Undead icy zombies?

02:22:43.289 --> 02:22:47.840
MATT: There's an entire ecosystem of very
dangerous monstrosities that exist there, which

02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:53.903
means there are living and dead. An elephant
graveyard of various aberrations and terrible

02:22:53.903 --> 02:22:55.253
creatures.

02:22:55.253 --> 02:23:00.793
TRAVIS: Well, look, if there are undead cannibal
dwarves or whatever in the crypts, don't we need

02:23:00.793 --> 02:23:02.760
clerics to deal with them?

02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:04.263
LIAM: We have a cleric.

02:23:04.263 --> 02:23:05.416
SAM: Let's take her.

02:23:05.416 --> 02:23:07.101
LAURA: Pike!

02:23:07.101 --> 02:23:09.070
MATT: "Yeah?"

02:23:09.070 --> 02:23:12.802
LAURA: Are you willing to leave the temple now?

02:23:12.802 --> 02:23:25.479
MATT: "I'm afraid for my people there, but I feel
I can probably send myself with you like I have in

02:23:25.479 --> 02:23:26.739
"the past."

02:23:26.739 --> 02:23:28.919
LIAM: It's all or nothing, Pickle.

02:23:28.919 --> 02:23:36.508
MATT: "I feel bad abandoning everyone that I've
brought to the temple."

02:23:36.508 --> 02:23:38.491
LAURA: You aren't abandoning them.

02:23:38.491 --> 02:23:40.119
LIAM: You're shielding them.

02:23:40.119 --> 02:23:45.717
MARISHA: You could always do like the astral
projection thing, right?

02:23:45.717 --> 02:23:47.469
MATT: "That's what I was thinking of doing."

02:23:47.469 --> 02:23:56.386
LAURA: Well, okay, but if you're astral
projecting, aren't you chilling in one room here,

02:23:56.386 --> 02:23:59.493
not really communicating, anyway?

02:23:59.493 --> 02:24:01.491
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:24:01.491 --> 02:24:06.583
MARISHA: I don't know if it's for Pike or for the
DM.

02:24:06.583 --> 02:24:13.454
TALIESIN: We have a bit of a roving blind spot
here that we could use.

02:24:13.454 --> 02:24:15.665
LAURA: 13.

02:24:15.665 --> 02:24:18.441
MATT: 13?

02:24:18.441 --> 02:24:24.131
LAURA: Oh no! But this can't be the only thing
that determines if she's an astral projection or

02:24:24.131 --> 02:24:25.484
if she comes with us?

02:24:25.484 --> 02:24:27.717
LIAM: My begging has to count, as well!

02:24:27.717 --> 02:24:30.628
(laughter)

02:24:30.628 --> 02:24:34.740
MARISHA: She destroyed a whole undead army being a
laser light beam.

02:24:34.740 --> 02:24:38.428
LIAM: Yeah! That's right, she Tron'd those
motherfuckers.

02:24:38.428 --> 02:24:42.206
LAURA: Will everything work like normal if she's
astral projection?

02:24:42.206 --> 02:24:50.474
MATT: I'll tell you what, if you're so eager to
bring Pike along, and Ashley can't play, do you

02:24:50.474 --> 02:24:52.547
guys want to jaeger her? Because I don't want to.

02:24:52.547 --> 02:24:55.695
LAURA: Yeah, we'll totally jaeger her if she's
okay with it.

02:24:55.695 --> 02:25:01.999
MARISHA: Remember, we've talked about this.
There's also the thing that if she dies while

02:25:01.999 --> 02:25:05.391
Ashley's not here, we're fucking assholes!

02:25:05.391 --> 02:25:07.419
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:25:07.419 --> 02:25:10.609
LAURA: Okay, that's very true.

02:25:10.609 --> 02:25:14.782
MARISHA: She won't die if she's a (bubbling)
thing.

02:25:14.782 --> 02:25:19.319
LAURA: But if she's an astral projection, can she
still use the champion's blessing that she got

02:25:19.319 --> 02:25:21.464
from Sarenrae and stuff?

02:25:21.464 --> 02:25:22.777
MATT: We'll find out.

02:25:22.777 --> 02:25:24.373
LAURA: Motherfuck.

02:25:24.373 --> 02:25:27.100
MARISHA: But we can always easily go get her.

02:25:27.100 --> 02:25:28.905
TRAVIS: It's the best we can do.

02:25:28.905 --> 02:25:36.201
MATT: The dungeon master will remember that.

02:25:36.201 --> 02:25:42.194
TRAVIS: All right, so what, the Crypts or the
Silted Veil?

02:25:42.194 --> 02:25:49.399
SAM: One thing that I can tell you about the
Crypts that you may not know. They're not man-made

02:25:49.399 --> 02:25:56.628
crypts. They're actually the inside of a fallen
titan's body.

02:25:56.628 --> 02:26:00.677
LAURA: How do you know that?

02:26:00.677 --> 02:26:02.792
SAM: I know things.

02:26:02.792 --> 02:26:07.701
(laughter)

02:26:07.701 --> 02:26:14.987
SAM: It seems like a pretty godly place to go to
make a statement.

02:26:14.987 --> 02:26:19.570
LIAM: Are you telling me we're going to have to
crawl into another monster's asshole? Is that what

02:26:19.570 --> 02:26:21.134
you're saying?

02:26:21.134 --> 02:26:24.387
SAM: It's Friday.

02:26:24.387 --> 02:26:30.508
MARISHA: And now we have two immovable rods!

02:26:30.508 --> 02:26:42.785
(cheering)

02:26:42.785 --> 02:26:50.082
TALIESIN: That got weird.

02:26:50.082 --> 02:26:52.261
SAM: All right.

02:26:52.261 --> 02:26:53.320
TRAVIS: So the Crypts?

02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:58.253
SAM: To the Crypts, I say. But are we druiding
there and then flying on a dragon, or just flying

02:26:58.253 --> 02:26:59.915
on a dragon?

02:26:59.915 --> 02:27:06.932
MATT: Pike's, "Well, I mean, I'll come with you if
that's all right? If we're going to this, we need to do

02:27:06.932 --> 02:27:14.859
"this together. I trust the city guard. And if it
gets real bad, you'll take us back, right,

02:27:14.859 --> 02:27:16.347
"Keyleth?"

02:27:16.347 --> 02:27:17.911
MARISHA: What?

02:27:17.911 --> 02:27:22.496
MATT: "If it gets real bad, you'll take us back,
right?"

02:27:22.496 --> 02:27:25.483
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:27:25.483 --> 02:27:31.913
MATT: "Then let's do it!" And she puts her hand
out towards Grog.

02:27:31.913 --> 02:27:35.349
TRAVIS: (shouting) Fuck yeah, buddy!

02:27:35.349 --> 02:27:44.341
(cheering)

02:27:44.341 --> 02:27:49.973
MATT: It looks like most of the sanctum is now
dissipating and heading out towards the front of

02:27:49.973 --> 02:27:54.744
the temple and going about some sort of structured
exit to prepare for this assault.

02:27:54.744 --> 02:27:56.127
LIAM: Allura!

02:27:56.127 --> 02:28:04.035
MATT: As she's standing by, walking with Kima,
they're in a heated discussion with a member of

02:28:04.035 --> 02:28:14.066
the Paramours of the Quadroads. She turns.
"Vax'ildan, yes. It's good to see you."

02:28:14.066 --> 02:28:26.624
LIAM: It is &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; good to see you. We need advice.
We need help. There you go. When we fought Vecna,

02:28:26.624 --> 02:28:37.704
he threw us around like ragdolls. He held us. He
did whatever he wanted. Do you have any way, any

02:28:37.752 --> 02:28:44.764
&lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt;, any suggestion for helping us avoid his
grasp again? Because if it went the way it went

02:28:44.764 --> 02:28:47.771
the last time we are fucked right out of the
gate.

02:28:47.771 --> 02:28:55.572
MATT: "What do you perceive as the weaknesses you
suffered in that previous battle?"

02:28:55.572 --> 02:28:57.924
LIAM: What was that?

02:28:57.924 --> 02:29:02.445
MATT: "What do you perceive are the weaknesses
that you suffered in that previous battle?"

02:29:02.445 --> 02:29:04.313
LIAM: He was able to hold us, magically.

02:29:04.313 --> 02:29:11.706
MATT: "There are ways to make sure those bindings
don't hold you still. There are magics that can

02:29:11.706 --> 02:29:18.050
"prevent that. And if your enemy is as strong a
magic user as I know, he will use distance to his

02:29:18.050 --> 02:29:27.819
"advantage. Close that distance and make it your
advantage. I know not quite what he's capable of

02:29:27.819 --> 02:29:38.644
"in his new ascended form, and that scares me. But
strike quickly, strike true. Everything you've

02:29:38.644 --> 02:29:52.092
"got, work together. Communicate. And anything you
can do to allow yourself preparation, and the jump

02:29:52.092 --> 02:30:01.515
"on this fray, do it. That ring that Vord gave you,
that'll be a boon enough. If you can catch him off

02:30:01.515 --> 02:30:04.557
"guard, that might mean everything."

02:30:04.557 --> 02:30:09.797
LIAM: Thank you.

02:30:09.797 --> 02:30:17.022
LAURA: Do you know what kind of magic it is that
keeps him from holding us? Just wondering. You

02:30:17.022 --> 02:30:19.093
said there were kinds, but I want to make sure.

02:30:19.093 --> 02:30:22.961
MATT: "Certainly, there are a few in your midst
that you can utilize. There's a spell called

02:30:22.961 --> 02:30:27.504
"Freedom of Movement that can prevent being held or
paralyzed in that way."

02:30:27.630 --> 02:30:31.976
LAURA: That's good. Just making sure. Because I
thought that was what it was. I just wanted to

02:30:31.976 --> 02:30:32.932
double-check.

02:30:32.932 --> 02:30:37.883
MATT: "Completely understood."

02:30:37.883 --> 02:30:41.237
SAM: Well, shall we away then? We have to go now!

02:30:41.237 --> 02:30:48.795
MATT: "I'd like to come with you, but currently
with everything going on, let's be honest, if I'm

02:30:48.795 --> 02:30:54.091
"not there amongst the council, it's going to tear
itself apart. The sky as it is, the people of Emon

02:30:54.091 --> 02:30:58.361
"are threatening all sorts of insanity. I'm sure
you've seen shades of it here in a city which

02:30:58.361 --> 02:31:09.150
"&lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; faith. I myself am not completely absolved
of the dreams that haunt many others. I'll be

02:31:09.150 --> 02:31:14.204
"doing what I can to pay attention, but do note
that ring also prevents me from seeing in on you,

02:31:14.204 --> 02:31:23.111
"and I have to look out for Emon. Me and my lady
both."

02:31:23.111 --> 02:31:26.210
She turns over to Kima, who is currently in the
process of getting into an argument with a wyvern

02:31:26.210 --> 02:31:29.494
rider. You see her going, "Oh, come on. I can
ride, too!"

02:31:29.494 --> 02:31:33.293
"Have you ever ridden a wyvern?"

02:31:33.293 --> 02:31:42.131
"No! But I haven't met a wyvern I can't stare
down!" Wyvern rider turns around and chuckles and

02:31:42.131 --> 02:31:46.925
gets tripped immediately onto his face, the crush
of metal on the banks and he spins over and she,

02:31:46.925 --> 02:31:53.987
(harrumphs). Spins around and joins Allura's side
and goes, "I never really liked this place. Bunch

02:31:53.987 --> 02:31:59.002
"of pricks. Good to see you guys."

02:31:59.002 --> 02:32:02.337
TRAVIS: You as well, that Holy Avenger getting
some action lately?

02:32:02.337 --> 02:32:10.421
MATT: "Oh, nowhere near enough. That's okay. You
come back, and you and me will have a tussle."

02:32:10.421 --> 02:32:13.422
TRAVIS: God, I love Kima so much.

02:32:13.422 --> 02:32:21.818
MATT: "Don't be all doom and gloom, all right?
That's a promise. Stay alive."

02:32:21.818 --> 02:32:30.208
TRAVIS, LAURA, and LIAM: (singing) Stay alive.

02:32:30.208 --> 02:32:40.032
MATT: She looks up, and Allura looks down at her
and rubs the top of her head for a second. Kima

02:32:40.032 --> 02:32:52.008
pulls away. "Come back safe, okay? I'm going to
hold you to that." And you see there's a moment of

02:32:52.008 --> 02:32:56.948
her (sniffles), and she spins around not wanting
to show any weakness or emotion.

02:32:56.948 --> 02:33:06.308
Allura looks back and watches her turn away and
goes, "You'll make it through this. I've seen you

02:33:06.308 --> 02:33:07.975
"do great things."

02:33:07.975 --> 02:33:12.186
SAM: We'll try.

02:33:12.186 --> 02:33:24.367
MATT: "And you'll succeed. You have to. You have
many at your back. Look." And she puts her hand

02:33:24.367 --> 02:33:30.040
out and you can see now there's at least over 100
wyvern riders, all scattered amongst the various

02:33:30.040 --> 02:33:35.933
mountain outcroppings that are all getting on top
of their great winged beasts that are fully

02:33:35.933 --> 02:33:43.577
armored with wyvern barding and armor. They're
taking off in clusters and circling. "They're all

02:33:43.577 --> 02:33:52.224
"counting on you. They're going to make sure that
you have the opportunity you have, to put those to

02:33:52.224 --> 02:34:08.859
"good use." And she glances off to the side of your
pouch, closed as it is. "Come back." She turns

02:34:08.859 --> 02:34:11.339
around to go and join Kima.

02:34:11.339 --> 02:34:14.932
LAURA: Give Gilmore a hug for us, will you?

02:34:14.932 --> 02:34:22.427
MATT: She stops and turns. "I'll do that. I owe
him a visit, anyway."

02:34:22.427 --> 02:34:29.166
LIAM: And if he has any trinkets that lend Freedom
of Movement, we'll place an order.

02:34:29.166 --> 02:34:32.241
MATT: "I'll ask."

02:34:32.241 --> 02:34:35.242
LIAM: Tell him we say hi.

02:34:35.242 --> 02:34:46.418
MATT: "I will, and I'm sure he does as well. Take
care. Be safe. Come back." She turns and walks

02:34:46.418 --> 02:34:47.803
away.

02:34:47.803 --> 02:34:51.256
MARISHA: Did you see that?

02:34:51.256 --> 02:34:52.929
LAURA: See what?

02:34:52.929 --> 02:34:56.478
MARISHA: They think we're going to die!

02:34:56.478 --> 02:35:03.299
(laughter)

02:35:03.299 --> 02:35:06.269
SAM: They're right!

02:35:06.269 --> 02:35:08.171
TALIESIN: Safe bet.

02:35:08.171 --> 02:35:10.272
TRAVIS: I feel pretty encouraged.

02:35:10.272 --> 02:35:11.707
LAURA: Yeah?

02:35:11.707 --> 02:35:13.242
TRAVIS: I don't know why.

02:35:13.242 --> 02:35:18.168
LAURA: Well, I'm glad.

02:35:18.168 --> 02:35:27.140
MARISHA: So what exactly is our plan? Is it to try
and keep Vecna from gaining more forces, or are we

02:35:27.140 --> 02:35:30.263
trying to cut off Vecna and his forces?

02:35:30.263 --> 02:35:34.497
LAURA: I think they're taking care of the forces.
We're taking care of the god.

02:35:34.497 --> 02:35:37.233
TALIESIN: They're the distraction.

02:35:37.233 --> 02:35:39.460
MARISHA: Then why go through the crypt?

02:35:39.460 --> 02:35:41.443
TALIESIN: We think that's where they're headed.

02:35:41.443 --> 02:35:46.344
LIAM: But are we trying to take out potential
additional forces?

02:35:46.344 --> 02:35:49.640
TALIESIN: That'd be my thought. That's where I
would go.

02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:53.410
MARISHA: Is that not what other people are doing?

02:35:53.410 --> 02:35:58.031
TALIESIN: I think that the surprise that he's
expecting to bring to the city, possibly,

02:35:58.031 --> 02:36:04.048
especially with the information you brought, is
that he would try and raise this creature and use

02:36:04.048 --> 02:36:05.618
it against the city.

02:36:05.618 --> 02:36:11.913
LAURA: So he's basically wanting to raise a giant
zombie titan full of zombie cannibal dwarves, and

02:36:11.913 --> 02:36:16.332
then they'll poo them out to fight other people.

02:36:16.332 --> 02:36:20.530
TALIESIN: Somehow you make that less threatening.
I'm not sure how you do that.

02:36:20.530 --> 02:36:28.075
LIAM: You know it's like when you take a duck and
you put it inside a chicken and then you put the

02:36:28.075 --> 02:36:30.525
chicken inside a turkey.

02:36:30.525 --> 02:36:36.644
SAM: Well, let's get going before he starts
raising this thing. Come on!

02:36:36.644 --> 02:36:38.533
TALIESIN: Turducken of the Damned.

02:36:38.533 --> 02:36:46.743
(laughter)

02:36:46.743 --> 02:36:53.410
LAURA: Here's the thing, are we relying on Grog to
stab these trammels through Vecna?

02:36:53.410 --> 02:36:58.457
LIAM: Or do we each need to deliver the one tied
to our gods?

02:36:58.457 --> 02:37:01.970
TALIESIN: If we can all three in one swift
movement once we've weakened--

02:37:01.970 --> 02:37:06.240
LAURA: It takes three separate attacks, I'm
assuming, right? Or would it be attack, attack,

02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:07.557
attack?

02:37:07.557 --> 02:37:15.315
(laughter)

02:37:15.315 --> 02:37:16.615
TALIESIN: So much sass.

02:37:16.615 --> 02:37:20.986
MATT: You gather by the nature of their
enchantment and the size of it, you can't cluster

02:37:20.986 --> 02:37:23.405
them together like darts and jam them into the
board at once.

02:37:23.405 --> 02:37:29.974
LAURA: Okay, but it would be one of those
situations where you'd have to attack and then

02:37:29.974 --> 02:37:32.425
draw another one, and then attack, right?

02:37:32.425 --> 02:37:33.897
MATT: It's possible.

02:37:33.897 --> 02:37:36.576
SAM: Or three of us could each have one.

02:37:36.576 --> 02:37:42.154
MARISHA: But he mentioned Vecna has to be severely
damaged--

02:37:42.154 --> 02:37:44.569
LAURA: Already, before we even do that.

02:37:44.569 --> 02:37:53.612
MATT: There have to be breaks in the avatar form
for them to pierce. There have to be breaks,

02:37:53.612 --> 02:38:01.132
wounds, visible cracks in the veneer of the avatar
for the actual trammels to pierce.

02:38:01.132 --> 02:38:09.010
MARISHA: So we're talking about doing this. Hey,
DM? Logistical question: how many days does it

02:38:09.010 --> 02:38:17.400
take me to make a 4th-level scroll? Spell. Spell
scroll? 4th-level. How many days?

02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:20.417
TRAVIS: Say it a couple more times.

02:38:20.417 --> 02:38:30.257
MATT: That's going to be quite a while, that's
weeks and weeks and weeks. That's a downtime

02:38:30.257 --> 02:38:31.634
activity.

02:38:31.634 --> 02:38:36.729
SAM: I thought our whole deal was we're about to
go do a surprise attack? We have to go &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;.

02:38:36.729 --> 02:38:41.976
LAURA: We do. We're saying we don't have time to
make a scroll spell, scroll scroll, spell scroll.

02:38:41.976 --> 02:38:48.067
MARISHA: Allura also said, yo, plan. Maybe plan a
little.

02:38:48.067 --> 02:38:53.862
LIAM: Also, DM: did we get told for these
trammels, for these harpoons, that they need to be

02:38:53.862 --> 02:38:58.263
wielded by the person associated to their gods, or
can Grog chuck them all?

02:38:58.263 --> 02:39:04.386
MATT: From what you understand there was no
specification of that. It was more the fusing of

02:39:04.386 --> 02:39:08.756
the divine energy within the trammels' creation
grants it with the power. The means of delivering

02:39:08.756 --> 02:39:10.628
it doesn't seem to be as important.

02:39:10.628 --> 02:39:12.113
LAURA: But it is a melee weapon?

02:39:12.113 --> 02:39:16.982
MATT: It's javelin-like; it could be thrown.

02:39:16.982 --> 02:39:20.615
TALIESIN: We didn't make them to be aerodynamic,
did we?

02:39:20.615 --> 02:39:24.984
MATT: They're somewhat aerodynamic by nature. Once
again, you can certainly try.

02:39:24.984 --> 02:39:29.116
LAURA: I'm going to pass the Pelor trammel back to
you.

02:39:29.116 --> 02:39:38.180
MARISHA: I have Freedom of Movement. But I have
three 4th-level spells. I can start burning into

02:39:38.180 --> 02:39:45.255
my 5th-level spells, as well, but it lasts for an
hour, so I was trying to figure out if there's a way--

02:39:45.255 --> 02:39:47.220
MATT: Pike says, "I can also do it."

02:39:47.220 --> 02:39:50.245
MARISHA: Oh! Yeah!

02:39:50.245 --> 02:39:55.903
LAURA: And it's not concentration, right, so you
can also cast Death Ward?

02:39:55.903 --> 02:39:57.733
MATT: "It lasts for an hour."

02:39:57.733 --> 02:39:59.786
TALIESIN: We'll wait until we're a little closer.

02:39:59.786 --> 02:40:02.205
LAURA: And Death Ward lasts for eight hours?

02:40:02.205 --> 02:40:10.327
MATT: "Death Ward? Yes! They're both 4th-level,
though."

02:40:10.327 --> 02:40:15.625
TRAVIS: These words are all great and everything
but it's not going to change that we're going to

02:40:15.625 --> 02:40:20.546
have to make it up when we get there, so why don't
we go ahead and fight this fucking fucker?

02:40:20.546 --> 02:40:25.611
(cheering)

02:40:25.611 --> 02:40:34.527
MATT: As you begin to descend down the stairs on
the outskirts of the mountainside, you can see

02:40:34.527 --> 02:40:40.861
the wyvern riders have now gathered into two large
units, and in the distance, shrieks of wyvern calls

02:40:40.861 --> 02:40:47.884
begin to echo through the mountain range. They all
begin to swoop towards the Abundant Terrace. You

02:40:47.884 --> 02:40:50.187
guys follow suit?

02:40:50.187 --> 02:40:51.455
LAURA: Sure.

02:40:51.455 --> 02:40:56.314
MATT: All right, as you make your way to the
Abundant Terrace on the outskirts of the

02:40:56.314 --> 02:41:01.122
Birthheart, there are the orchards, the large
clusters of trees that you have traveled to and

02:41:01.122 --> 02:41:06.153
from before when travelling to and from Vasselheim
at Keyleth's behest. And there you can see a

02:41:06.153 --> 02:41:14.744
number of the high priest druids of Melora have
all gathered around the High Hierophant, and

02:41:14.744 --> 02:41:19.911
they're preparing means of transport for all the
troops, wyverns included, to those that are going

02:41:19.911 --> 02:41:26.580
to make it as part of this initial front-line
assault. As you guys approach and watch, you see

02:41:26.580 --> 02:41:33.547
as other generals and such begin to gather their
army units. They begin to discuss orders, and a

02:41:33.547 --> 02:41:38.692
number of them in the middle of this refer over to
you guys. You can see there's definitely direction

02:41:38.692 --> 02:41:43.462
being given in regards to you guys. Someone wants
to stop their alarm?

02:41:43.462 --> 02:41:46.135
TALIESIN: Okay, this is going to be weird.

02:41:46.135 --> 02:41:48.716
LAURA: Is it yours?

02:41:48.716 --> 02:41:50.856
TALIESIN: It's that.

02:41:50.856 --> 02:41:52.754
MATT: Oh, there's an actual alarm on the stage.

02:41:52.754 --> 02:41:54.386
MARISHA: Oh my god, there is!

02:41:54.386 --> 02:41:58.692
SAM: When it turned 12 midnight, the alarm clock
went off!

02:41:58.692 --> 02:42:00.462
MATT: It's not flashing.

02:42:00.462 --> 02:42:02.333
MARISHA: That's hilarious!

02:42:02.333 --> 02:42:05.419
MATT: Thank you, Taliesin.

02:42:05.419 --> 02:42:10.914
(cheering)

02:42:10.914 --> 02:42:14.724
LAURA: He just hit snooze, you guys.

02:42:14.724 --> 02:42:18.457
LIAM: Yeah, five more minutes, Raven Mom. Five
more minutes.

02:42:18.457 --> 02:42:22.933
LAURA: It was all a dream!

02:42:22.933 --> 02:42:35.957
MATT: As you approach, Ophera steps up. "It would
be my honor to grant you passage to the base of

02:42:35.957 --> 02:42:41.116
"the mountain range. I believe your other companion
is approaching soon, as well." And she looks over

02:42:41.116 --> 02:42:47.897
past your shoulder as you glance and you see J'mon
Sa Ord approaching. Within their arms is a small

02:42:47.897 --> 02:42:54.936
leather chest, a container of some kind. J'mon
steps up and places it before you, pulls it back

02:42:54.936 --> 02:42:59.505
and backs away with a brandishing presentation.

02:42:59.505 --> 02:43:01.205
LAURA: What is it?

02:43:01.205 --> 02:43:17.023
MATT: "May these potions keep you healthy." Within
here, there are eight superior healing potions.

02:43:17.023 --> 02:43:23.255
LAURA: Whoa! Okay.

02:43:23.255 --> 02:43:32.241
TRAVIS: Well, we're really in for a fucking fight,
huh?! When the game gives you eight superiors.

02:43:32.241 --> 02:43:36.817
LAURA: So everybody take one superior, right?

02:43:36.817 --> 02:43:38.346
SAM: Everybody gets one.

02:43:38.346 --> 02:43:39.807
MATT: And there's one extra.

02:43:39.807 --> 02:43:42.076
LIAM: They are so fucking badass.

02:43:42.076 --> 02:43:45.448
LAURA: Everybody gets one and there's one extra?

02:43:45.448 --> 02:43:48.214
MATT: Yeah, because there are eight and you have
seven in your party.

02:43:48.214 --> 02:43:53.851
LAURA: I'm going to mark down that Pike has one.

02:43:53.851 --> 02:43:58.815
TALIESIN: And who's made of the most glass? Who's
going to get hit the most?

02:43:58.815 --> 02:44:01.220
LIAM: Scanlan is important.

02:44:01.220 --> 02:44:02.892
LAURA: Scanlan's super important.

02:44:02.892 --> 02:44:04.865
LIAM: Scanlan should have two.

02:44:04.865 --> 02:44:06.615
SAM: Guys, I'm fine.

02:44:06.615 --> 02:44:10.198
(laughter)

02:44:10.198 --> 02:44:14.299
LAURA: I know you're very fine and you're very
capable.

02:44:14.299 --> 02:44:19.344
LIAM: Also karma is a thing, and I really want to
balance the scales.

02:44:19.344 --> 02:44:24.248
SAM: Why would &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; feel any pressure that way?

02:44:24.248 --> 02:44:28.393
LIAM: We've got a long road of history, you and
I.

02:44:28.393 --> 02:44:29.925
SAM: We're best buds!

02:44:29.925 --> 02:44:36.404
LIAM: Best buds! Best buds, met at Big Apple Anime
Fest in New York City all those years ago.

02:44:36.404 --> 02:44:40.189
AUDIENCE: Aww.

02:44:40.189 --> 02:44:49.397
SAM: All right, I'll take two.

02:44:49.397 --> 02:44:50.733
LAURA: Yeah. Okay.

02:44:50.733 --> 02:44:52.736
SAM: In Marquesian I say, thank you, J'mon Sa Ord.

02:44:52.736 --> 02:44:55.753
MATT: "Be pleased."

02:44:55.753 --> 02:44:59.307
LAURA: We are. Very.

02:44:59.307 --> 02:45:12.393
SAM: Also, if you don't like the Meat Man, I can
make him go away.

02:45:12.393 --> 02:45:20.642
MATT: "Their business has not encroached upon the
order that we maintain. Yet."

02:45:20.642 --> 02:45:23.460
(laughter)

02:45:23.460 --> 02:45:25.601
MATT: "You'd know if it did."

02:45:25.601 --> 02:45:27.899
LIAM: (whispers) They know!

02:45:27.899 --> 02:45:38.619
MATT: The smoldering pupils that they contain
within their darkened eyes stare back at you with

02:45:38.619 --> 02:45:40.629
a curling smile.

02:45:40.629 --> 02:45:46.898
SAM: Thank you. Let's go. We've got to get through
this druidy thing, right?

02:45:46.898 --> 02:45:53.421
MATT: Ophera backs up and, putting her staff to one
side, makes a large oval shape with her fingers as

02:45:53.421 --> 02:45:57.807
she mutters beneath her breath. You watch as one
of the heavy, thick trunks of the nearest tree

02:45:57.807 --> 02:46:02.413
begins to tear and crack and pull inward. And
there you see in a similar fashion to Keyleth's

02:46:02.413 --> 02:46:09.574
casting, though a little more visceral, an opening
reveals itself and a doorway is opened, and she

02:46:09.574 --> 02:46:11.405
goes, "Quick! Now!"

02:46:11.405 --> 02:46:14.237
MARISHA: I like your technique!

02:46:14.237 --> 02:46:22.547
MATT: You all rush through, one after another,
flanked at the end by J'mon. And as you all

02:46:22.547 --> 02:46:29.620
approach the opposite side of this portal, you
emerge in a somewhat crowded forest of pine trees.

02:46:29.620 --> 02:46:37.646
Immediately, the northern air is colder, and you
see drifting bits of snowfall softly coming

02:46:37.646 --> 02:46:42.570
through bits of the tree line above you. You turn
around just in time to see the doorway close, and

02:46:42.570 --> 02:46:49.402
in the distance you see other doorways opening
around you in different trees, and you watch as

02:46:49.402 --> 02:46:55.340
dozens upon dozens of wyvern riders and armored
soldiers begin to emerge, one cluster after the next.

02:46:55.340 --> 02:46:57.580
MARISHA: Fucking druids are badass!

02:46:57.580 --> 02:47:03.958
TALIESIN: Let's do this.

02:47:03.958 --> 02:47:14.454
MATT: You glance up and can briefly see the top
northern crest of where the Zenwick Mountain pass

02:47:14.454 --> 02:47:21.189
is. Just past the canopy of the forest you're in,
because you were sent to the very slim base of the

02:47:21.189 --> 02:47:27.499
Zenwick Mountains. You're within a forest. What do
you want to do?

02:47:27.499 --> 02:47:30.039
LIAM: What does my Vec-dar tell me?

02:47:30.039 --> 02:47:35.708
MATT: Interestingly enough, southeast of where you
are.

02:47:35.708 --> 02:47:37.155
LIAM: Shit.

02:47:37.155 --> 02:47:39.142
LAURA: How close?

02:47:39.142 --> 02:47:44.708
MATT: I'd say it's probably close to four miles
from where you are.

02:47:44.708 --> 02:47:52.152
LAURA: Oh shit.

02:47:52.152 --> 02:47:55.816
MATT: And slowly moving away.

02:47:55.816 --> 02:48:00.457
LIAM: We guessed wrong?

02:48:00.457 --> 02:48:02.030
MARISHA: Four miles.

02:48:02.030 --> 02:48:05.484
TALIESIN: Did we guess wrong?

02:48:05.484 --> 02:48:09.102
LIAM: Well, we don't know where this shit is that
we're looking for.

02:48:09.102 --> 02:48:10.770
SAM: Do we know where these things are?

02:48:10.770 --> 02:48:14.274
MATT: They're both northwest of where you are, in
the mountain range.

02:48:14.274 --> 02:48:15.890
MARISHA: He's passed them.

02:48:15.890 --> 02:48:16.871
LIAM: Passed over.

02:48:16.871 --> 02:48:18.341
MATT: He's passed over, it seems.

02:48:18.341 --> 02:48:19.348
LIAM: Fuck.

02:48:19.348 --> 02:48:22.635
SAM: What do we do?

02:48:22.635 --> 02:48:30.320
MARISHA: If we get a little bit closer, I can do a
Commune with Nature spell and try and figure out

02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:32.934
some stuff. It's all I've got. I can scry!

02:48:32.934 --> 02:48:39.057
LAURA: I mean, if he's already passed by the
crypts, is there any reason to go there? I don't

02:48:39.057 --> 02:48:40.163
understand.

02:48:40.163 --> 02:48:42.950
TRAVIS: What direction is Vasselheim from us now?

02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:44.349
MATT: Southeast.

02:48:44.349 --> 02:48:45.798
MARISHA: The way they're heading.

02:48:45.798 --> 02:48:51.105
TRAVIS: Anybody else think we should fucking hop
on a big-ass brass dragon and try and catch him

02:48:51.105 --> 02:49:00.906
before he gets there? What are we going to do
here? There's nothing to do here!

02:49:00.906 --> 02:49:02.845
LAURA: You want us to go fight Vecna right now?

02:49:02.845 --> 02:49:06.513
TRAVIS: Either that, or he goes and sacks the city
and we're like, "What does this tree tell me about

02:49:06.513 --> 02:49:07.969
"this area?"

02:49:07.969 --> 02:49:17.957
(laughter)

02:49:17.957 --> 02:49:21.949
LIAM: Quickly, please, someone come up with an argument
that counteracts that.

02:49:21.949 --> 02:49:24.769
TALIESIN: We should scry on the dwarven city if we
can, really quickly.

02:49:24.769 --> 02:49:26.969
SAM: How? We don't know much about it.

02:49:26.969 --> 02:49:28.615
TALIESIN: Do we know enough to scry?

02:49:28.615 --> 02:49:34.900
MARISHA: I can scry on Lady Briarwood.

02:49:34.900 --> 02:49:38.383
LAURA: Do it. Do it right now.

02:49:38.383 --> 02:49:40.779
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Ooh!

02:49:40.779 --> 02:49:43.471
MARISHA: Yeah, I bet she's with him.

02:49:43.471 --> 02:49:45.542
TALIESIN: Or she's not.

02:49:45.542 --> 02:49:48.153
LIAM: We'll learn something.

02:49:48.153 --> 02:49:51.154
LAURA: Are you zoning in on the city, or are you
zoning in on Vecna?

02:49:51.154 --> 02:49:55.593
TALIESIN: We know where Vecna is. We just need to
see where Lady Briarwood is.

02:49:55.593 --> 02:49:57.740
MARISHA: All right, scrying on Briarwood. Oh, she
rolls.

02:49:57.740 --> 02:50:00.031
MATT: She rolls. To make a saving roll. Spell DC
is?

02:50:00.031 --> 02:50:01.858
MARISHA: 21!

02:50:01.858 --> 02:50:04.384
MATT: And that is a 22.

02:50:04.384 --> 02:50:08.529
(groaning)

02:50:08.529 --> 02:50:13.959
MATT: Sorry. As you try and focus, the incantation
completes and as your vision begins to extend it

02:50:13.959 --> 02:50:18.151
is blocked by darkness and sent back into your
form. And you realize the scry has failed, the

02:50:18.151 --> 02:50:19.514
will is too strong.

02:50:19.514 --> 02:50:22.479
LAURA: Can you scry on that death knight guy that
was next to her?

02:50:22.479 --> 02:50:27.341
MARISHA: Is he still with her, though?

02:50:27.341 --> 02:50:32.726
LAURA: We didn't kill him. We did not kill him. We
did not hit him! We did not!

02:50:32.726 --> 02:50:36.763
(laughter)

02:50:36.763 --> 02:50:45.750
MARISHA: Oh, hi Vex. All right. I'll scry on
undead douchey.

02:50:45.750 --> 02:50:55.483
MATT: As your vision extends from you, it races
through the darkness. You see dark clouds ahead.

02:50:55.483 --> 02:51:03.606
As it fires down, you look instantly within the
streets of Thar Amphala. You see the cobblestone

02:51:03.606 --> 02:51:11.679
roads now cracked and broken, you see buildings
appear to have sustained structural damage. You

02:51:11.679 --> 02:51:16.631
see roofs are partially collapsed. And walking
down the street, strolling with a number of undead

02:51:16.631 --> 02:51:21.897
soldiers at its back, the black knight you battled
before. As it struts through you watch as the

02:51:21.897 --> 02:51:32.831
towers and buildings (rumbling) shake. And shake
again. And your vision returns.

02:51:32.831 --> 02:51:34.581
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

02:51:34.581 --> 02:51:42.501
MARISHA: It was shaking-- Oh, is it on the back of
some giant turtle or something?

02:51:42.501 --> 02:51:45.488
(laughter)

02:51:45.488 --> 02:51:48.647
TALIESIN: We should stop that from happening.

02:51:48.647 --> 02:51:52.362
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're super lucky and it's just a
turtle.

02:51:52.362 --> 02:52:00.735
(laughter)

02:52:00.735 --> 02:52:03.222
TRAVIS: How lucky for us!

02:52:03.222 --> 02:52:05.258
MARISHA: It'd be so cute.

02:52:05.258 --> 02:52:12.148
MATT: "Then there is no time to waste." You watch
as J'mon Sa Ord's form shifts and giant brass

02:52:12.148 --> 02:52:22.303
wings extend in a flash of reddish-orange energy.
The nearby trees bend and break at the sheer force

02:52:22.303 --> 02:52:29.334
of the dragon's magnitude, their form expanding to
fill the recent vicinity of the forest, and with a

02:52:29.334 --> 02:52:35.897
large guttural roar, you see before you the brass
dragon.

02:52:35.897 --> 02:52:39.330
SAM: Shotgun!

02:52:39.330 --> 02:52:45.373
LAURA: Hey, Keyleth? While we're flying through
the air, is it possible for you to give us a nice

02:52:45.373 --> 02:52:47.754
inspiring speech?

02:52:47.754 --> 02:52:50.554
MARISHA: Oh! (giggles)

02:52:50.554 --> 02:52:54.315
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:52:54.315 --> 02:53:01.450
LIAM: It's all right. It's just our small group
here. No one's watching. You know us.

02:53:01.450 --> 02:53:11.913
MARISHA: Yeah. Man, inspiring speech. So we're on
a brass dragon?

02:53:11.913 --> 02:53:18.412
MATT: You can do it while you're all climbing on
the back. They're waiting patiently for you all to

02:53:18.412 --> 02:53:21.364
jump onto the back of the dragon form.

02:53:21.364 --> 02:53:27.973
SAM: If you need a second to think about it, it's
okay. We can start off first and then come back to you.

02:53:27.973 --> 02:53:29.775
MARISHA: Wait, what?

02:53:29.775 --> 02:53:32.080
SAM: Do you need a second to compose yourself?

02:53:32.080 --> 02:53:35.677
MARISHA: You know, Scanlan.

02:53:35.677 --> 02:53:42.734
(cheering)

02:53:42.734 --> 02:53:49.951
MARISHA: It's funny you should mention that,
because I do need a second. I have to think about

02:53:49.951 --> 02:53:56.567
my words deeply and a long time, and even still,
they come out wrong, and you're so witty and

02:53:56.567 --> 02:54:01.987
quick! And you can come up with things like
speeches and songs on the fly in front of

02:54:01.987 --> 02:54:12.281
thousands of people way quicker than I can. It is
not my strength, but I do know my strength, and I

02:54:12.281 --> 02:54:27.092
know each of your strengths. But not as well of
each of you know your strengths as well as you do.

02:54:27.092 --> 02:54:33.832
SAM: Sing it, sister.

02:54:33.832 --> 02:54:40.661
MARISHA: What I'm saying is, you should believe in
yourselves the way that I believe in you, Scanlan.

02:54:40.661 --> 02:54:52.091
And the way that you believe in everyone else,
Scanlan! Because you're all strong and unique. And

02:54:52.091 --> 02:54:53.826
we're probably going to die.

02:54:53.826 --> 02:54:58.865
(laughter)

02:54:58.865 --> 02:55:04.036
MARISHA: (stammers) Okay, let's fly! Ahoy!

02:55:04.036 --> 02:55:27.292
MATT: With a slow, metallic, crinkling sound of
brass dragon scales curling, the large head of

02:55:27.292 --> 02:55:34.196
J'mon Sa Ord's dragon form spins around to look
you dead in the face, Keyleth. The same dark eyes

02:55:34.196 --> 02:55:39.103
with the smoldering, burning cores for pupils, the
mouth opens and you can smell immediately the

02:55:39.103 --> 02:55:46.602
breath that has a very earthy, singed, burnt-wood
scent to it.

02:55:46.602 --> 02:55:50.638
MARISHA: Ooh, cedar!

02:55:50.638 --> 02:56:00.925
MATT: And the voice goes forth. "Very good,
Keyleth. I found that quite inspiring."

02:56:00.925 --> 02:56:12.745
(cheering)

02:56:12.745 --> 02:56:16.294
MATT: And with that, you guys can all take your 18
temporary hit points.

02:56:16.294 --> 02:56:18.587
TRAVIS: How much is it?

02:56:18.587 --> 02:56:20.695
TALIESIN: 18 temporary hit points?

02:56:20.695 --> 02:56:30.454
MATT: And with that note, with one large push of
their strong dragon wings, J'mon Sa Ord raises

02:56:30.454 --> 02:56:35.249
beyond the treeline up into the sky above, where
you can see the clusters of wyvern riders have now

02:56:35.249 --> 02:56:42.957
also gathered to survey the territory. The first
thing you notice, the southward wall, the tall,

02:56:42.957 --> 02:56:48.395
rocky landscape surrounding the fields of ice,
dust, and grasses that fill this pass, you can see

02:56:48.395 --> 02:56:55.251
the mountain range seems to have suffered an
immense amount of damage. A gargantuan fresh

02:56:55.251 --> 02:57:00.534
rockslide nearly a mile wide, now resting at the
base of the northern mountain, you can see

02:57:00.534 --> 02:57:04.337
swallowing and burying some of the forest land.

02:57:04.337 --> 02:57:16.711
And as you glance southward into the Tordusk Pass,
you can see mammoth holes in the ground, large

02:57:16.711 --> 02:57:23.989
craters of broken dirt and rock forced into dunes
of mud and shale surrounding their outsides. The

02:57:23.989 --> 02:57:31.982
scars, pockmarks 200 feet across, carved into the
terrain. I'd like everyone to make an intelligence

02:57:31.982 --> 02:57:34.085
check, please.

02:57:34.085 --> 02:57:38.480
LAURA: We're making a what, an intelligence
check?

02:57:38.480 --> 02:57:40.739
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check?

02:57:40.739 --> 02:57:41.718
MATT: Sure.

02:57:41.718 --> 02:57:42.641
MARISHA: Yeah?

02:57:42.641 --> 02:58:01.496
(cheering)

02:58:01.496 --> 02:58:03.123
MATT: Vex'ahlia?

02:58:03.179 --> 02:58:04.711
LAURA: Is this an intelligence?

02:58:04.711 --> 02:58:06.177
MATT: Yes. This is your intelligence modifier.

02:58:06.177 --> 02:58:07.076
LAURA: 21.

02:58:07.076 --> 02:58:08.777
MATT: 21, good. Vax?

02:58:08.777 --> 02:58:11.166
LIAM: Oh, man. Eight.

02:58:11.166 --> 02:58:13.355
MATT: Keyleth?

02:58:13.355 --> 02:58:15.471
MARISHA: I am doing a nature check.

02:58:15.471 --> 02:58:16.688
MATT: Right, to find out?

02:58:16.688 --> 02:58:24.045
MARISHA: If it looks like a path has been bore
through in a straight line, like it looks like

02:58:24.045 --> 02:58:25.710
it's going through. 24.

02:58:25.710 --> 02:58:31.202
MATT: 24? What you can tell from a nature check is
that these are not natural formations in the

02:58:31.202 --> 02:58:39.058
ground. These are blunt trauma to the ground that
has caused these large craters.

02:58:39.058 --> 02:58:42.840
LAURA: Does it look like a walking path? A very
large walking path?

02:58:42.840 --> 02:58:44.493
MATT: Percival?

02:58:44.493 --> 02:58:46.232
TALIESIN: Natural 20, for 25.

02:58:46.232 --> 02:58:50.330
MATT: Scanlan?

02:58:50.330 --> 02:58:51.454
SAM: 19 total.

02:58:51.454 --> 02:58:57.704
MATT: Okay. Percival. And Keyleth. And Perc'ahlia.
Not you Grog, sorry.

02:58:57.704 --> 02:59:00.725
TRAVIS: Holes!

02:59:00.725 --> 02:59:13.065
MATT: You do notice, upon immediate view, that
these large holes are patterned, staggered about

02:59:13.065 --> 02:59:24.672
every 350-400 feet. And they do almost present the
gait of a walking creature.

02:59:24.672 --> 02:59:27.637
MARISHA: (anguished sounds)

02:59:27.637 --> 02:59:30.045
TRAVIS: Hey! You got that big fucking turtle you
wanted!

02:59:30.045 --> 02:59:34.776
MARISHA: It is a giant turtle!

02:59:34.776 --> 02:59:41.415
LIAM: The final miniature is just Matt.

02:59:41.415 --> 02:59:48.221
MATT: "It has been foreseen!" I've been working on
my costume.

02:59:48.221 --> 02:59:53.325
LAURA: Do we see anything in the air, any of those
shadow creatures? Or is it just our wyvern

02:59:53.325 --> 02:59:54.121
riders?

02:59:54.121 --> 02:59:58.115
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:59:58.115 --> 02:59:59.588
LAURA: Natural 20!

02:59:59.588 --> 03:00:07.002
MATT: Okay. As you lift up to survey more
territory, you manage to get a brief view over the

03:00:07.002 --> 03:00:14.945
edge of that mountain range. You do not see any of
the gloomstalkers that you had previously faced

03:00:14.945 --> 03:00:19.768
near Thar Amphala. In the vicinity, there is only
the wyvern riders and a few errant birds that

03:00:19.768 --> 03:00:24.925
normally take to the skies that are keeping a wide
berth from your sudden emerging army that has

03:00:24.925 --> 03:00:30.138
joined you in the skies. You glance over this
mountain range, and you look about. About two,

03:00:30.138 --> 03:00:35.295
three miles northward, you can see the same path
of destruction has torn through these mountain

03:00:35.295 --> 03:00:43.049
ranges in a sinkhole, hundreds and hundreds of
feet across that disappears into darkness.

03:00:43.049 --> 03:00:50.753
LAURA: Is the sinkhole in the direction of the
city that's moving right now?

03:00:50.753 --> 03:00:53.809
MATT: No, it's in the direction you guys were
planning to travel.

03:00:53.809 --> 03:00:57.164
SAM: Oh. Maybe that's where they ripped the thing
out.

03:00:57.164 --> 03:01:02.958
TALIESIN: It's where it came out. How big are
these footprints, approximately?

03:01:02.958 --> 03:01:11.519
LAURA: (shouting) That's the fucking titan! It's
the titan full of dwarf bodies! I just realized that!

03:01:11.519 --> 03:01:14.255
(laughter)

03:01:14.255 --> 03:01:19.248
MARISHA: It totally fucking is, yeah. Yeah.

03:01:19.248 --> 03:01:22.734
LIAM: And his name is Larkin.

03:01:22.734 --> 03:01:28.166
(laughter)

03:01:28.166 --> 03:01:36.429
LAURA: Shit! I thought it was just a really big
giant, and then I remembered it was a titan.

03:01:36.457 --> 03:01:43.917
MATT: Yes, each one of these craters is roughly
150 or so feet across.

03:01:43.917 --> 03:01:47.705
SAM: Oh, his feet are a hundred feet across?!

03:01:47.705 --> 03:01:49.458
MATT: 150 to 200 feet across, yeah.

03:01:49.458 --> 03:01:53.898
TALIESIN: Keyleth, how big would a creature be if
it had footprints approximately 150 to 200 feet

03:01:53.898 --> 03:01:54.840
across?

03:01:54.840 --> 03:01:59.599
SAM: At least a hundred feet big!

03:01:59.599 --> 03:02:01.161
MARISHA: Probably bigger?

03:02:01.161 --> 03:02:03.537
SAM: Maybe even bigger!

03:02:03.537 --> 03:02:07.667
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to find out how
fucking big this guy is?

03:02:07.667 --> 03:02:09.079
MATT: Sure.

03:02:09.079 --> 03:02:17.451
MARISHA: Yeah! Let's do this lucky one. That's not
too bad. 28.

03:02:17.451 --> 03:02:21.123
MATT: Based on your experience with various
creatures that leave large tracks you've dealt

03:02:21.123 --> 03:02:30.100
with or hunted in your history with the Ashari,
it's &lt;i&gt;big&lt;/i&gt;. The legs generally are pretty thick

03:02:30.100 --> 03:02:37.748
for a creature of immense size because it has to
support all that weight, but if each footfall,

03:02:37.748 --> 03:02:44.759
crater here is about 150, 200 feet wide, you can
surmise the creature is hundreds of feet tall.

03:02:44.759 --> 03:02:46.824
TRAVIS: At least six times.

03:02:46.824 --> 03:02:53.339
LAURA: At least 600 feet tall. What did you say?

03:02:53.339 --> 03:02:56.098
LIAM: I said we're going to have to Shadow of
Colossus this shit.

03:02:56.098 --> 03:02:58.734
LAURA: How are we going to fucking fight something
that's 600 feet tall?

03:02:58.734 --> 03:03:01.600
TRAVIS: If it bleeds, we-- we're going to die.

03:03:01.600 --> 03:03:12.309
(laughter)

03:03:12.309 --> 03:03:19.653
MARISHA: Hang on, though. Caverns. Undead caverns
of dwarves inside the titan.

03:03:19.682 --> 03:03:23.578
LIAM: Yeah, maybe we crawl up its butthole and
kill the things inside.

03:03:23.578 --> 03:03:26.623
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe, or fight it from the inside
out?

03:03:26.623 --> 03:03:28.071
LAURA: Maybe?

03:03:28.071 --> 03:03:33.082
TALIESIN: That's the most exciting Dwarven Forge
thing I'd ever want to see. The Godzilla

03:03:33.082 --> 03:03:34.153
interior.

03:03:34.153 --> 03:03:38.000
LAURA: We got to get inside of it.

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:41.557
TALIESIN: It may be all it takes.

03:03:41.557 --> 03:03:44.629
LAURA: Are we on J'mon Sa Ord's back?

03:03:44.629 --> 03:03:50.587
MATT: Yes, right now it's large brass dragon
wings (flapping).

03:03:50.587 --> 03:03:55.215
TALIESIN: Neverending Storying our way to a
terrible death.

03:03:55.215 --> 03:04:01.726
TRAVIS: Can you detect if we're making up any
ground on your target? I'm talking to you, Vax.

03:04:01.726 --> 03:04:05.041
SAM: Liam, are we getting closer?

03:04:05.041 --> 03:04:12.489
LIAM: My brain's on Vecna, not on the city. Is
Vecna doing a ride-along? Is he still moving in

03:04:12.489 --> 03:04:13.741
the same direction?

03:04:13.741 --> 03:04:17.883
MATT: Yeah, Vecna's slowly traveling in that
southeast direction.

03:04:17.883 --> 03:04:19.740
SAM: Follow the tracks, then.

03:04:19.740 --> 03:04:26.475
MATT: All right. With that, you hear the booming
voice of J'mon once more, "Very well. Let us be

03:04:26.475 --> 03:04:32.700
"off." (whoosh) And goes into a fast-paced dive.
You all grab a hold of nearby dragon scale and/or

03:04:32.700 --> 03:04:38.093
loose bits of fur there are as it drives into this
huge dive, this gargantuan dragon.

03:04:38.093 --> 03:04:40.816
LAURA: Trinket's in the necklace for this part.

03:04:40.816 --> 03:04:42.862
MATT: I assumed as such.

03:04:42.862 --> 03:04:49.750
TRAVIS and LIAM: (scared bear noises)

03:04:49.750 --> 03:04:56.045
MATT: You see as the wyvern riders immediately
take this action and begin to swoop and follow

03:04:56.045 --> 03:05:03.566
suit, as well, following behind them. At this point,
you are the tip of the spear of this assault at

03:05:03.566 --> 03:05:09.541
this very moment. You begin to follow this
pattern, cross the pass, heading south-southeast,

03:05:09.541 --> 03:05:15.324
heading over and through different mountain
ranges. The higher you get, the wind gets a little

03:05:15.324 --> 03:05:20.266
more intense, and the cold begins to get more
biting. And J'mon dips down a bit to avoid having

03:05:20.266 --> 03:05:27.503
to thrust you into this very dangerous
stratosphere. The light in this area is very close

03:05:27.503 --> 03:05:32.006
to near dusk almost, with how much the sunlight is
blotted out by the cloud cover that has completely

03:05:32.006 --> 03:05:35.124
consumed the skyline, from horizon to horizon, on
all sides.

03:05:35.124 --> 03:05:41.570
MARISHA: I do a bit of a Gust spell ahead of us to
clear the path, give him a little more visual line

03:05:41.570 --> 03:05:42.616
of sight.

03:05:42.616 --> 03:05:49.300
MATT: "Thank you," you hear emanate from J'mon as
the cloud cover tends to spread a little bit and

03:05:49.300 --> 03:06:00.514
give a little bit of a good view. You travel on
for about 25, 30 or so minutes before Vex, Vax,

03:06:00.514 --> 03:06:10.768
and Keyleth, you glance around the bend of the
pass that you've just begun to curve around, and

03:06:10.768 --> 03:06:21.324
you see it: an impossibly immense entity, standing
hundreds and hundreds of feet tall. A gigantic,

03:06:21.324 --> 03:06:30.471
bulky mass of jagged rock, slowly walking on two
castle-width legs, each footfall sending a

03:06:30.471 --> 03:06:37.305
cloud-spray of earth into the air around it.
(crashing) Quaking the surrounding lands with a

03:06:37.305 --> 03:06:44.947
terrifying crack and rumble. As the back leg
lifts, sifting through the air, you can almost

03:06:44.947 --> 03:06:52.590
hear the air tear with a high-pitched whine, even
at this distance, as its sheer mass and speed in

03:06:52.590 --> 03:06:56.774
which it's cutting through, breaking the
atmosphere, slams down for its next step.

03:06:56.774 --> 03:07:07.935
(crashing) As you get a better view, the closer
you get, it resembles the earth elemental form

03:07:07.935 --> 03:07:15.890
you've seen Keyleth take many times, only
proportionally malformed, and terrifying on a

03:07:15.890 --> 03:07:25.683
scale you've never seen. Four colossal arms
swing from its torso, battering rams of shifting

03:07:25.683 --> 03:07:37.380
stone, each over 150 feet wide. The closer you
get, Grog, you sense a faint vibration in the

03:07:37.380 --> 03:07:39.394
Titanstone Knuckles.

03:07:39.394 --> 03:08:01.144
TRAVIS: Oh my fucking god. Just a note. These were
made from the heart of a felled titan. I don't

03:08:01.144 --> 03:08:03.213
think it's that one.

03:08:03.213 --> 03:08:05.143
LAURA: It could be! That one's dead!

03:08:05.143 --> 03:08:08.280
TRAVIS: That was sarcasm, but yeah.

03:08:08.280 --> 03:08:12.923
SAM: Are you going to take him, one on one?

03:08:12.923 --> 03:08:15.252
LAURA: Does that mean you can beat him up from the
inside?

03:08:15.252 --> 03:08:17.099
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, beat him up with his heart!

03:08:17.099 --> 03:08:18.658
LAURA: Yeah!

03:08:18.658 --> 03:08:26.466
TRAVIS: (stammering) Do I notice anything?

03:08:26.466 --> 03:08:36.144
MATT: Not in particular. You clap, and it sounds
booming, as it would. The closer you get, you

03:08:36.144 --> 03:08:42.413
sense this very faint vibration to them, as if
proximity keys you in, and even your simple

03:08:42.413 --> 03:08:48.177
mind, Grog, can gather that these were crafted
and made from whatever it is you see storming

03:08:48.177 --> 03:08:50.401
through that ravine.

03:08:50.401 --> 03:08:52.984
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:08:52.984 --> 03:08:58.473
LIAM: Do I feel Vecna riding on this guy's
shoulder?

03:08:58.473 --> 03:09:07.660
MATT: You sense the direction and distance of
Vecna directly where this entity lies. I would

03:09:07.660 --> 03:09:10.984
like you to make a perception check, please.

03:09:10.984 --> 03:09:12.202
LAURA: Do a what?

03:09:12.202 --> 03:09:21.332
MATT: Perception check. Just him for now as he's
focusing.

03:09:21.332 --> 03:09:23.564
LIAM: 27.

03:09:23.564 --> 03:09:27.587
MATT: You glance past as your proximity grows
closer and closer. One, you notice that there are

03:09:27.587 --> 03:09:34.873
beehive-type activity around the top where its
head would be. There is no massive head

03:09:34.873 --> 03:09:40.995
protruding, just the shoulder shelf where the top of it
becomes these four arms, and it's faced away from

03:09:40.995 --> 03:09:47.036
you, facing the way it's traveling, its arms
swinging wildly with each step, slowly. Its size

03:09:47.036 --> 03:09:55.096
is difficult for you to fathom at this distance.
It seems so big yet so small. As you get closer,

03:09:55.096 --> 03:10:00.862
you can see these bee swarm-like clusters
resemble creatures you saw in the Shadowfell not

03:10:00.862 --> 03:10:14.326
too long ago, and there atop the shelf of its
gargantuan torso, you see a cityline resting atop of

03:10:14.326 --> 03:10:23.834
this entity. There lies a portion of Thar Amphala,
moving with this gargantuan primordial earth

03:10:23.834 --> 03:10:36.525
titan, risen from below its long-held tomb.

03:10:36.525 --> 03:10:43.812
LAURA: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on
us. It's not going to make any difference, but I'm

03:10:43.812 --> 03:10:45.215
going to do it.

03:10:45.215 --> 03:10:48.068
TALIESIN: Will that work on the back of a big
shiny dragon?

03:10:48.068 --> 03:10:54.485
TRAVIS: Another note, to be clear, these were
carved from the heart stone of a ruined earth

03:10:54.485 --> 03:11:01.597
primordial. When they're doing their thing, they
make me resistant to fire, cold, and lightning

03:11:01.597 --> 03:11:05.591
damage. So. That's good.

03:11:05.591 --> 03:11:17.183
MARISHA: Yeah. Theory time. Maybe. This primordial
is marching with Thar Amphala on its back to

03:11:17.183 --> 03:11:25.208
Vasselheim. If I were a god, wanting to prove that
I'm awesome and do a big miracle thing, I would

03:11:25.208 --> 03:11:27.860
drop a giant city on top of another city.

03:11:27.860 --> 03:11:31.247
TRAVIS: Or destroy the city and replace it with
that one.

03:11:31.247 --> 03:11:45.914
SAM: We can stop this, though. All we have to do
is beat the titan. I've got magic missiles that

03:11:45.914 --> 03:11:50.061
can do 1d6 damage.

03:11:50.061 --> 03:11:56.635
MATT: 1d4 plus one.

03:11:56.635 --> 03:11:59.649
SAM: We could be in business!

03:11:59.649 --> 03:12:04.491
TRAVIS: Listen. I know it seems really dire,
right? But the only other option besides attacking

03:12:04.491 --> 03:12:09.572
it, in my mind, is trying to get its attention.
Maybe lead it away from Vasselheim.

03:12:09.572 --> 03:12:14.210
TALIESIN: I think it's also, in theory, necrotic,
which means it can be turned.

03:12:14.210 --> 03:12:19.750
LAURA: That would be one powerful fucking spell.

03:12:19.750 --> 03:12:22.337
TALIESIN: We're going to have to do something.

03:12:22.337 --> 03:12:26.043
LAURA: Pike, how strong are you feeling right
now?

03:12:26.043 --> 03:12:30.913
MATT: You look back at Pike, who's clutching onto
the back of J'mon Sa Ord. Seeing this, her face

03:12:30.913 --> 03:12:35.589
pale white, eyes wide. She's like, "I don't
know."

03:12:35.589 --> 03:12:38.279
TRAVIS: It's all right, buddy!

03:12:38.279 --> 03:12:40.214
LAURA: You got it. You're a monster!

03:12:40.214 --> 03:12:50.779
MATT: (weakly) "I'm a monster! It's also a
monster!"

03:12:50.779 --> 03:12:55.348
(laughter)

03:12:55.348 --> 03:13:00.351
SAM: Should we land on the city on its back, or
should we try to fuck up the titan?

03:13:00.351 --> 03:13:06.036
LAURA: I think we should dive into one of the
beehive tunnels and stealth in. I think &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt;

03:13:06.036 --> 03:13:12.585
should still be stealth mode. J'mon can drop us
off. J'mon, you distract all of the city with all

03:13:12.585 --> 03:13:16.287
of your wyvern riders, as well, and we'll come in
from the bottom up, yeah?

03:13:16.287 --> 03:13:22.702
MATT: "I think that is a very sound plan.
However," and as the dragon's head turns and looks

03:13:22.702 --> 03:13:29.256
ahead, you can see some of these clusters of
gloomstalkers have broken away from the titan,

03:13:29.256 --> 03:13:35.469
swarming in your direction. You're about, I'd say,
a mile and a half away from it and gaining, only

03:13:35.469 --> 03:13:41.331
because you're pushing at full speed. You're
seeing now them breaking off into the clusters and

03:13:41.331 --> 03:13:43.939
you hear the distant (screeching).

03:13:43.939 --> 03:13:49.708
TRAVIS: I know we bamfed out here, but do we have
any idea how much time we have? How far away from

03:13:49.708 --> 03:13:51.412
Vasselheim we are?

03:13:51.412 --> 03:13:54.683
SAM: How far have we gone?

03:13:54.683 --> 03:13:57.061
MATT: Fom what you can tell, make a--

03:13:57.061 --> 03:14:00.735
TRAVIS: Don't make me make it. No, I'm ready.
Let's go!

03:14:00.735 --> 03:14:02.974
LAURA: I'm going to guess, too, because he's
asking out loud.

03:14:02.974 --> 03:14:04.607
MARISHA and TALIESIN: It's a good question.

03:14:04.607 --> 03:14:06.034
MATT: Make a nature check.

03:14:06.034 --> 03:14:11.632
MARISHA: Can I do it, too?

03:14:11.632 --> 03:14:12.892
TRAVIS: Negative two!

03:14:12.892 --> 03:14:17.982
(laughter)

03:14:17.982 --> 03:14:24.639
TRAVIS: My modifier, my &lt;i&gt;modifier,&lt;/i&gt; so 15. It was
17; I was excited.

03:14:24.639 --> 03:14:34.398
MATT: Not too bad! You haven't traversed this area
of the north side of Issylra before, but gathering

03:14:34.398 --> 03:14:41.841
based on where you were, seeing the sinkhole, and
the distance that Vax'ildan was giving you

03:14:41.841 --> 03:14:47.696
earlier, you imagine it's probably about 200 miles
or so away from Vasselheim.

03:14:47.696 --> 03:14:51.599
TRAVIS: Okay, we've got time. Not a lot.

03:14:51.599 --> 03:14:54.247
MATT: It has a very wide gait with each step.

03:14:54.247 --> 03:14:58.621
TRAVIS: But it's like Godzilla, right? It's like
(groaning, thud).

03:14:58.621 --> 03:15:04.242
MATT: Yeah! So you have time, but it's not 200
miles on normal person feet.

03:15:04.242 --> 03:15:06.025
TRAVIS: I mean, if he starts skipping, we're
fucked.

03:15:06.025 --> 03:15:18.769
LAURA: Hey, Keyleth. Do you have any of that Wild
Guide-- is that what's it called? That herb that scares away

03:15:18.769 --> 03:15:20.920
the undead.

03:15:20.920 --> 03:15:24.086
MARISHA: I do. Well, I grabbed some, so I can
cultivate more of it, yeah.

03:15:24.086 --> 03:15:26.308
LAURA: You should probably do that.

03:15:26.308 --> 03:15:29.819
LIAM: They're a mile and a half away, and they see
us, it looks like.

03:15:29.819 --> 03:15:33.128
MATT: Yeah, they're closing in, there's a short
time before they reach you. Remember, at this

03:15:33.128 --> 03:15:39.219
traveling speed, any sort of smoke-based censer
material is going to go right behind you like a flare.

03:15:39.219 --> 03:15:46.367
LIAM: Can we turn into clouds, Keyleth, and fly
off of our dragon ride and poof inside the titan?

03:15:46.367 --> 03:15:48.094
MARISHA: Let me see what I packed.

03:15:48.094 --> 03:15:52.060
TRAVIS: We'd be in the air, and not all of us are
so awesome in the air.

03:15:52.060 --> 03:15:57.427
LAURA: We could fall off this dragon's back real
fast.

03:15:57.427 --> 03:16:13.347
MARISHA: Okay. We could do Wind Walk. It's going
to take a minute to transform in and out. I also

03:16:13.347 --> 03:16:15.014
have Animal Shapes.

03:16:15.014 --> 03:16:18.496
SAM: J'mon, can you become invisible, by any
chance?

03:16:18.496 --> 03:16:32.443
MATT: J'mon, you hear the voice rumble, "I can,
but only myself. I could maybe affect a couple of you."

03:16:32.443 --> 03:16:35.200
SAM: I could affect a couple of us.

03:16:35.200 --> 03:16:36.498
LAURA: How many?

03:16:36.498 --> 03:16:38.913
SAM: Three.

03:16:38.913 --> 03:16:49.328
LAURA: That leaves quite a few of us left. Maybe,
J'mon, could you get--

03:16:49.328 --> 03:16:50.691
LIAM: Five?

03:16:50.691 --> 03:16:52.943
MATT: "I could muster about four."

03:16:52.943 --> 03:16:57.666
TRAVIS: That's enough. Three and four.

03:16:57.666 --> 03:16:59.786
LIAM: Pike.

03:16:59.786 --> 03:17:01.986
TRAVIS: I can't add.

03:17:01.986 --> 03:17:13.214
SAM: Or! I could make J'mon look like one of those
dark flappy things and make us look like undead

03:17:13.214 --> 03:17:14.231
creatures?

03:17:14.231 --> 03:17:16.846
LAURA: They probably have seen us coming, though;
they're on their way here.

03:17:16.846 --> 03:17:21.614
SAM: Yeah. Invisible, then?

03:17:21.614 --> 03:17:24.716
TALIESIN: At least we're a smaller target, at that
point.

03:17:24.716 --> 03:17:30.154
MARISHA: I can throw out a fog cloud and try and
fog us the rest of the way.

03:17:30.154 --> 03:17:32.329
SAM: We'll fly through it; it won't work.

03:17:32.329 --> 03:17:33.840
MARISHA: We're in clouds!

03:17:33.840 --> 03:17:36.336
SAM: If you do the thing, we'll keep going through
it.

03:17:36.336 --> 03:17:40.662
MARISHA: Oh. Yeah. That's a good point.

03:17:40.662 --> 03:17:44.215
TRAVIS: Invisible or change us. One or the other.

03:17:44.215 --> 03:17:46.999
LIAM: You could do invisible and I could fly as
fast as I fucking can away.

03:17:46.999 --> 03:17:51.154
MATT: (screeching) The cloud breaks ahead and you
watch as two gloomstalkers come diving down

03:17:51.154 --> 03:17:53.405
towards the back of J'mon.

03:17:53.405 --> 03:17:54.685
SAM: Let's do invisible!

03:17:54.685 --> 03:17:57.124
LAURA: I shoot one with an arrow.

03:17:57.124 --> 03:17:58.545
TALIESIN: I shoot the other one with a gun.

03:17:58.545 --> 03:18:00.242
MATT: Both of you guys, roll attacks.

03:18:00.242 --> 03:18:04.032
TALIESIN: It's okay. We're going at a speed that
it doesn't matter. Did that just happen?

03:18:04.032 --> 03:18:05.969
SAM: Yeah, I just knocked over a wine bottle.

03:18:05.969 --> 03:18:09.367
MATT and TRAVIS: A grape juice bottle.

03:18:09.367 --> 03:18:10.422
LAURA: 28.

03:18:10.422 --> 03:18:11.701
MATT: 28 hits.

03:18:11.701 --> 03:18:16.509
TALIESIN: (counting) 25.

03:18:16.509 --> 03:18:17.924
MATT: 25 hits, as well.

03:18:17.924 --> 03:18:23.547
TALIESIN: I should have said this. I was going to
burn a grit to drop.

03:18:23.547 --> 03:18:28.369
MATT: Right, I figured that was the case. One of
them gets shot with an arrow and as the impact

03:18:28.369 --> 03:18:32.486
hits, it shrieks but continues its dive. The second
one gets shot by-- which weapon was it?

03:18:32.486 --> 03:18:33.785
TALIESIN: Animus.

03:18:33.785 --> 03:18:39.243
MATT: With Animus. You watch as the detonation of
the spray of black from the impact of the bullet

03:18:39.243 --> 03:18:45.299
hitting. As it shrieks, its wings buckle from
underneath and it plummets about 30 or 40 feet or

03:18:45.299 --> 03:18:50.266
so and falls out of its dive. The one, however,
is still diving and it's going to go for the one

03:18:50.266 --> 03:19:00.256
that shot it with its arrow. Natural two. That's
going to be a 13. I'm pretty sure that doesn't hit you.

03:19:00.256 --> 03:19:01.531
LAURA: No, that doesn't hit.

03:19:01.531 --> 03:19:05.596
MATT: As it attempts to dive past you, you duck
out of the way, still nocking a secondary arrow.

03:19:05.596 --> 03:19:11.238
Its claws hits the back of the dragon scales. You
hear the scrape of it going across the back, but

03:19:11.238 --> 03:19:16.459
having no effect on the hard, armored brass
dragon's back. The gloomstalker then shrieks once

03:19:16.459 --> 03:19:20.042
more and takes back up into the clouds and
vanishes.

03:19:20.042 --> 03:19:22.515
LIAM: Did I get an attack of opportunity on it
with daggers?

03:19:22.515 --> 03:19:24.759
MATT: You can definitely attack it with daggers,
if you'd like.

03:19:24.759 --> 03:19:28.731
LIAM: Yeah, that hits. 29.

03:19:28.731 --> 03:19:30.404
MATT: That hits.

03:19:30.404 --> 03:19:33.147
LIAM: If my friend the dragon is against it, do I
get sneak attack?

03:19:33.147 --> 03:19:36.664
MATT: No. Sorry.

03:19:36.664 --> 03:19:40.470
LIAM: All right. That is 12 for that.

03:19:40.470 --> 03:19:43.479
MATT: 12 damage. How much damage did you do?

03:19:43.479 --> 03:19:44.663
LAURA: 15.

03:19:44.663 --> 03:19:52.567
MATT: As it shrieks and vanishes back into the clouds
above, you can see now the wyvern riders around

03:19:52.567 --> 03:19:59.647
are starting to charge in, as well. As you're rushing
now, you're maybe three-quarters of a mile from

03:19:59.647 --> 03:20:01.724
the exterior of this giant earth titan.

03:20:01.724 --> 03:20:03.076
LAURA: Invisible!

03:20:03.076 --> 03:20:09.186
MATT: All right. You complete your incantation in
time with J'mon, and the entirety of your party

03:20:09.186 --> 03:20:15.273
turns transparent and is now free from visual
perspective.

03:20:15.273 --> 03:20:17.904
LIAM: Did we get everybody?

03:20:17.904 --> 03:20:20.506
MATT: You did three?

03:20:20.506 --> 03:20:22.997
SAM: I can do four if J'mon can't.

03:20:22.997 --> 03:20:30.716
MATT: J'mon can do four. Well, Pike and J'mon
would be eight.

03:20:30.716 --> 03:20:33.167
SAM: Okay, so we'll do four and four.

03:20:33.167 --> 03:20:39.753
MATT: And with that, you all manage to disappear
and go into a dive. As soon as you all vanish,

03:20:39.753 --> 03:20:43.744
which is interesting because you disappear, and
suddenly your mount disappears, and all your

03:20:43.744 --> 03:20:48.502
friends disappear. So you're clutching on to what
you hope is still dragon scales and fur as you

03:20:48.502 --> 03:20:56.133
look down and see clouds, ground, mountains, and
eventual, plummeting death, were you not holding

03:20:56.133 --> 03:20:57.306
onto the back of the dragon.

03:20:57.306 --> 03:20:59.778
TRAVIS: (screams)

03:20:59.778 --> 03:21:04.013
TALIESIN: Wait, if our eyelids are invisible, does
that mean we can't even close our eyes?

03:21:04.013 --> 03:21:05.897
MATT: You can close your eyes.

03:21:05.897 --> 03:21:10.124
TALIESIN: No, it's too much. Too much. Not cool.

03:21:10.124 --> 03:21:14.174
MATT: I will say, because the enchantment doesn't
make you translucent, just invisible to the visual

03:21:14.174 --> 03:21:16.906
gaze, the interior of your eyelids would not be
affected by it.

03:21:16.906 --> 03:21:20.016
TALIESIN: Okay. That's my worst nightmare.

03:21:20.016 --> 03:21:23.012
MATT: Much like a Harry Potter invisibility cloak.
You can still see the inside of the cloak

03:21:23.012 --> 03:21:24.081
somewhat.

03:21:24.081 --> 03:21:26.179
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I was just having a Clockwork
Orange moment.

03:21:26.179 --> 03:21:32.755
MARISHA: You make yourself more nauseous by
closing your eyes.

03:21:32.755 --> 03:21:34.168
TALIESIN: That's not true.

03:21:34.168 --> 03:21:37.932
MATT: As you go into this dive, you can hear the
clashing of wyvern against gloomstalker. You hear

03:21:37.932 --> 03:21:44.411
the yelps and the shrieks of two different bestial
cries. You hear shouts of humanoid and elven

03:21:44.411 --> 03:21:51.086
voices shouting as spears are tossed, arrows are
let loose, and this aerial fray begins. With that,

03:21:51.086 --> 03:21:57.005
you glance forward as the dragon comes out of a
dive, J'mon leading you towards this gargantuan

03:21:57.005 --> 03:22:12.436
entity. You can hear the further volume, the
(massive footsteps). Even slower than that,

03:22:12.436 --> 03:22:18.248
probably, based on the gait it has to walk and the
speed it's going. It is like watching a mountain

03:22:18.248 --> 03:22:22.397
with legs move. As you approach, what do you do?

03:22:22.397 --> 03:22:25.296
SAM: Do we see a clearing? A landing spot?

03:22:25.296 --> 03:22:32.167
MATT: You can make a perception check, guys. All
of you.

03:22:32.167 --> 03:22:38.483
LAURA: 25.

03:22:38.483 --> 03:22:40.277
MARISHA: 30.

03:22:40.277 --> 03:22:41.301
TALIESIN: 24.

03:22:41.301 --> 03:22:42.909
TRAVIS: Six.

03:22:42.909 --> 03:22:45.096
SAM: Eight.

03:22:45.096 --> 03:22:52.355
MATT: Eight, awesome. All right. Keyleth. You
guys, at this distance, it's hard to make out

03:22:52.355 --> 03:22:57.175
details. But Keyleth, you rolled a 30, which
according to 5th Edition is nearly impossible as a

03:22:57.175 --> 03:23:11.419
DC. So. You glance about and amongst the broken
rock exterior of this behemoth entity, you can see

03:23:11.419 --> 03:23:19.759
towards the base of its right leg, towards the
back, a faint trickle of water, like a waterfall

03:23:19.759 --> 03:23:32.172
of pee, probably. A trickling of a waterfall
that's flowing from its back leg area and then

03:23:32.172 --> 03:23:34.023
dissipating as it plummets into the air.

03:23:34.023 --> 03:23:36.201
MARISHA: That's it?

03:23:36.201 --> 03:23:39.157
SAM: Is it coming from the city or coming from the
titan?

03:23:39.157 --> 03:23:40.158
MATT: From the titan.

03:23:40.158 --> 03:23:42.815
MARISHA: He's leaking from the back of his calf.

03:23:42.815 --> 03:23:45.697
LAURA: Let's go in there, then.

03:23:45.697 --> 03:23:48.135
MARISHA: From the back of his hip.

03:23:48.135 --> 03:23:52.865
TALIESIN: Let's see if we can land on that burst
pimple, then.

03:23:52.865 --> 03:24:00.945
MARISHA: I don't think there's any landing. I
think there's going to be-- yeah. But you know

03:24:00.945 --> 03:24:02.863
what? Let's see what happens.

03:24:02.863 --> 03:24:04.750
LAURA: Let's fly in close to that waterfall.

03:24:04.750 --> 03:24:10.019
MATT: Okay, so you point this out to J'mon? All
right. You hear the dragon voice boom up once

03:24:10.019 --> 03:24:18.091
more. "Hold on!" Goes into an intense dive trying
to bring-- because previously you were about level,

03:24:18.091 --> 03:24:22.499
if not a little higher than Thar Amphala on the
top of the entity. J'mon goes into a dive towards

03:24:22.499 --> 03:24:28.037
the hip area that you point out. The wind is
pushing past you. You're holding on for dear life

03:24:28.037 --> 03:24:31.436
because any possible loss of grip not only is
going to loose you from the dragon, which is going

03:24:31.436 --> 03:24:40.430
to be hard to find you, as you're all invisible,
depending on the dragon's abilities, I guess. But

03:24:40.430 --> 03:24:45.296
as you begin to push down into this dive, I want
you all to make strength saving throws, please.

03:24:45.296 --> 03:24:50.540
LAURA: Oh god, strength? Jeez Louise.

03:24:50.540 --> 03:24:52.382
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

03:24:52.382 --> 03:24:59.459
TALIESIN: Natural 20!

03:24:59.459 --> 03:25:03.447
(cheering)

03:25:03.447 --> 03:25:09.705
(groaning)

03:25:09.705 --> 03:25:12.296
SAM: I got an 11.

03:25:12.296 --> 03:25:21.554
LIAM: I'm using my first Luck of the day. Oh,
that's worse. That is a nine for me.

03:25:21.554 --> 03:25:27.167
LAURA: God. A 22 for me. I know!

03:25:27.167 --> 03:25:32.504
MARISHA: This is a group success or failure thing,
right?

03:25:32.504 --> 03:25:39.563
MATT: In almost a poetic justice way, both Vax and
Keyleth begin to lose their grip, and with a

03:25:39.563 --> 03:25:46.632
sequence of moments, they both get blown off the
back of the brass dragon.

03:25:46.632 --> 03:25:51.121
LAURA: We wouldn't even know. Were they touching
each other? Tell me they were.

03:25:51.121 --> 03:25:57.592
MATT: You and Vax are currently now, no grip on
any dragon.

03:25:57.592 --> 03:25:59.229
MARISHA: Vax! Whisper!

03:25:59.229 --> 03:26:02.464
LIAM: I throw my dagger at that sound.

03:26:02.464 --> 03:26:04.263
MATT: Roll an attack.

03:26:04.263 --> 03:26:09.386
MARISHA: Wait, what?

03:26:09.386 --> 03:26:11.989
TRAVIS: That sounds like us.

03:26:11.989 --> 03:26:19.166
LIAM: Were you saying you were going to come to me?
There's the 18!

03:26:19.166 --> 03:26:22.291
MATT: With disadvantage, because she is
invisible.

03:26:22.291 --> 03:26:23.973
LIAM: That's a 20.

03:26:23.973 --> 03:26:26.306
MATT: What's your armor class, Keyleth?

03:26:26.306 --> 03:26:27.708
MARISHA: He hits.

03:26:27.708 --> 03:26:30.913
LAURA: Good, so you can bamf to her.

03:26:30.913 --> 03:26:38.691
LIAM: That's right. 12 plus psychic damage,
honey.

03:26:38.691 --> 03:26:42.009
SAM: You guys have a fucked-up relationship.

03:26:42.009 --> 03:26:46.838
MARISHA: Our entire relationship has been psychic
damage, baby.

03:26:46.838 --> 03:26:58.356
LIAM: 14.

03:26:58.356 --> 03:27:03.565
MATT: So you take 14 points of piercing damage.
However, as soon as the pain hits you, it's

03:27:03.565 --> 03:27:08.344
immediately allayed by the impact of Vax's arms
wrapping around you for dear life.

03:27:08.344 --> 03:27:11.814
MARISHA: (sputtering)

03:27:11.814 --> 03:27:13.604
LIAM: I'm kissing you already.

03:27:13.604 --> 03:27:18.106
MATT: You both are now tumbling and plummeting
through the sky.

03:27:18.106 --> 03:27:20.475
LIAM: Do you want to fly, or should I?

03:27:20.475 --> 03:27:23.245
MARISHA: Hold on! And I go giant eagle form.

03:27:23.245 --> 03:27:30.576
MATT: Okay. The giant eagle form takes flight. As
her wings extend, you realize you've been

03:27:30.576 --> 03:27:36.455
clutching on to the under down feathers. As soon
as the form takes, you grasp hold and climb back

03:27:36.455 --> 03:27:46.746
onto the top of the giant eagle. With that, you
both (whooshing). Now, here's an interesting

03:27:46.746 --> 03:27:52.485
question, because invisibility lasts until you do
an attack or cast a spell. It's a magical ability,

03:27:52.485 --> 03:27:55.418
I'm going to say that because it's a natural
effect, it will not affect the invisibility,

03:27:55.418 --> 03:28:00.224
especially because you're at a high enough druid
level. Specifically, shape changing is your thing.

03:28:00.224 --> 03:28:06.355
So I'll say you skirt under what would reveal
invisibility. You lose it, however, for attacking

03:28:06.355 --> 03:28:14.719
her. So now there's a Vax huddled on nothing,
full-on Wonder Woman-style invisible jet, riding

03:28:14.719 --> 03:28:29.198
through the sky. So as you guys coast in, the rest
of you hear J'mon go, "It appears we've lost some

03:28:29.198 --> 03:28:30.701
"passengers."

03:28:30.701 --> 03:28:36.585
MARISHA: No! Keep going! (cawing) Tell them! Keep
going!

03:28:36.585 --> 03:28:45.908
LIAM: We're all right. Everything's fine here.
Everything's fine. How are you?

03:28:45.908 --> 03:28:54.219
SAM: J'mon, they say they're okay. It's okay, we
can go.

03:28:54.219 --> 03:29:01.600
MATT: "Very well." Continues into the dive. You
guys are trailing behind at this point, but making

03:29:01.600 --> 03:29:07.712
your way down towards the hip region of this
entity, following the direction that Keyleth gave

03:29:07.712 --> 03:29:15.598
at her spotting earlier. As you guys get closer
and closer, you can see there is indeed a

03:29:15.598 --> 03:29:22.190
trickle of a waterfall that is dissipating, the
wind is so strong that it gets maybe 25 or 30 feet

03:29:22.190 --> 03:29:24.544
down before it gets scattered into droplets.

03:29:24.544 --> 03:29:26.416
SAM: Is it pee-colored?

03:29:26.416 --> 03:29:32.661
MATT: No, it is actually pretty clear water. You
do also glance, as you get closer, it appears to

03:29:32.661 --> 03:29:35.412
be emerging from some sort of an opening, like a
cavern entrance.

03:29:35.412 --> 03:29:36.992
LAURA: Yeah, let's head for the opening.

03:29:36.992 --> 03:29:42.100
MATT: So as you approach--

03:29:42.100 --> 03:29:47.470
LAURA: We have Pass Without a Trace!

03:29:47.470 --> 03:30:01.851
MATT: You do, but the flying man does not. So as
the rest of you make it up towards the side, and

03:30:01.851 --> 03:30:06.334
the wind is strong here, you can hear the impact
of each footfall, so deafening your eardrums

03:30:06.334 --> 03:30:14.611
almost shake and are in pain with each impact, the
bass of each footfall is immense. But you do see,

03:30:14.611 --> 03:30:20.342
interestingly enough, there is the waterfall
coming out of it. The waterfall is careening down

03:30:20.342 --> 03:30:31.525
a broken stone staircase. The opening is about
15 feet across and about ten feet wide. It

03:30:31.525 --> 03:30:37.400
looks like it was at some point attached, before
this creature arose, to another series of tunnels

03:30:37.400 --> 03:30:41.965
or wherever else this dwarven stronghold, this
series of vaults that were carved within this

03:30:41.965 --> 03:30:49.594
creature's body, extended beyond its torso. This
is one of the breaking points. As you glance back,

03:30:49.594 --> 03:30:55.770
you can see your brother coasting down about a
hundred or so feet away. You also watch as one of

03:30:55.770 --> 03:30:58.672
the large arms swings back.

03:30:58.672 --> 03:31:00.432
LAURA: No!

03:31:00.432 --> 03:31:02.959
MARISHA: I dodge it! I try and dodge it!

03:31:02.959 --> 03:31:10.442
MATT: I need both of you guys to make dexterity
saving throws. Actually, because you're riding

03:31:10.442 --> 03:31:14.341
Keyleth right now, it's going to be on the giant
eagle form, because you're clutching it.

03:31:14.341 --> 03:31:15.888
MARISHA: It's just on me?

03:31:15.888 --> 03:31:21.943
MATT: It's just on you. It's hard to avoid a
hundred-plus-foot-wide arm.

03:31:21.943 --> 03:31:33.120
LIAM: This is a save? Wait. This is a dex save,
right? I'm blessing Keyleth.

03:31:33.120 --> 03:31:36.807
MATT: As you see it coming? I'll say you have the
time because it's so immense.

03:31:36.807 --> 03:31:43.014
MARISHA: Add a d4, yeah? Four, yeah! Okay, 24
total!

03:31:43.014 --> 03:32:05.394
MATT: That's not enough. You were one away. It's a
25 DC because this is a giant fucking arm! Both

03:32:05.394 --> 03:32:18.549
you and Vax-- I don't have the dice for this, so
I'm going to have to use the app. You both suffer

03:32:18.549 --> 03:32:29.917
87 points of bludgeoning damage as the force of a
mountain slams into the side of your half-elf and

03:32:29.917 --> 03:32:36.337
eagle form.

03:32:36.337 --> 03:32:38.546
MARISHA: You said 87?

03:32:38.546 --> 03:32:40.481
MATT: 87 points of bludgeoning damage, yes.

03:32:40.481 --> 03:32:47.146
MARISHA: Okay. I immediately drop form and start
falling.

03:32:47.146 --> 03:32:50.303
MATT: Okay, any carryover damage, make sure to
mark that.

03:32:50.303 --> 03:32:53.614
LIAM: Does Uncanny Dodge affect this at all?

03:32:53.614 --> 03:33:00.977
MATT: Unfortunately, because you were relying on
her eagle maneuverability, no.

03:33:00.977 --> 03:33:05.063
LIAM: Okay. Well then, I shoot the wings out
immediately.

03:33:05.063 --> 03:33:12.372
MATT: Okay. The wings emerge as both of you begin
to plummet at this point.

03:33:12.372 --> 03:33:14.796
MARISHA: I'm okay.

03:33:14.796 --> 03:33:23.294
MATT: Keyleth? As you're plummeting, Vax, I need
you to roll a perception check.

03:33:23.294 --> 03:33:41.143
SAM: J'mon, they're fine. They told us they're
fine! They'll be here any second! Don't worry.

03:33:41.143 --> 03:33:44.165
TALIESIN: We did see this happen, right?

03:33:44.165 --> 03:33:50.766
MATT: You guys are right now hovering by this and
looking back. You watch this occur. You see Vax

03:33:50.766 --> 03:34:00.013
get smacked, fall, and then his wings shoot out.
Vax, roll a perception check. With disadvantage.

03:34:00.013 --> 03:34:08.762
TALIESIN: Roll really high, twice.

03:34:08.762 --> 03:34:15.855
LIAM: I rolled the same thing, so it's a 24.
Reliable talent.

03:34:15.855 --> 03:34:23.810
MATT: Strangely, you're able to see a slight shift
in wind to give you a brief moment to see where

03:34:23.810 --> 03:34:27.396
Keyleth's invisible, plummeting body is.

03:34:27.396 --> 03:34:29.531
MARISHA: Oh, I'm still invisible as I'm falling.

03:34:29.531 --> 03:34:36.737
MATT: Yeah, because you haven't cast a spell or
any attacks. So you manage to see this brief

03:34:36.737 --> 03:34:42.864
shimmer in space where the wind bends around her
reverting form.

03:34:42.864 --> 03:34:44.981
LIAM: I pick it up, grab it.

03:34:44.981 --> 03:34:50.039
MATT: You thrust downward with your wings. You
grab her body and manage to carry. You can feel

03:34:50.039 --> 03:34:54.292
her invisible body below you as you bring it back
up.

03:34:54.292 --> 03:34:56.192
LIAM: Punch me in the face. Punch me in the face
right now!

03:34:56.192 --> 03:34:57.424
MARISHA: (yelling)

03:34:57.424 --> 03:35:00.617
LIAM: Hey, beautiful.

03:35:00.617 --> 03:35:02.229
MARISHA: I'm sorry!

03:35:02.229 --> 03:35:04.815
LIAM: Let's get the fuck out of here! Do a barrel
roll.

03:35:04.815 --> 03:35:19.878
MATT: All right. Another giant arm swings, but
swings wide as it attempts to swing in the same

03:35:19.878 --> 03:35:25.266
place it did before. It does not seem to see the
two of you quickly approach the proximity of its

03:35:25.266 --> 03:35:32.307
torso. You hear this (zooming) passing over you by
about 30 or 40 feet.

03:35:32.307 --> 03:35:35.384
MARISHA: Oh, trying to go for J'mon?

03:35:35.384 --> 03:35:43.530
MATT: No, trying to go where you guys were. You
still have a visual point on it, so you direct and

03:35:43.530 --> 03:35:47.049
tug Vax by the hair and ears in the direction of
the path you saw.

03:35:47.049 --> 03:35:48.953
MARISHA: By the ponytail.

03:35:48.953 --> 03:36:03.895
MATT: Yeah, basically. And there, on the edge, you
can see J'mon Sa Ord there, wings flapping, as you

03:36:03.895 --> 03:36:08.500
guys rocket down and land right on the edge of the
footsteps. There's about a five-foot gap where the

03:36:08.500 --> 03:36:10.413
water isn't rushing past.

03:36:10.413 --> 03:36:15.676
MARISHA: Okay. I immediately cast Control Water
and suck it inside.

03:36:15.676 --> 03:36:25.927
MATT: Okay. The waterfall stops and bends upward
and is now being held. You guys have a row of

03:36:25.927 --> 03:36:29.962
steps ahead of you that are safe enough to land on
right now. They're still slick with water, but

03:36:29.962 --> 03:36:32.679
there isn't a rushing waterfall pouring over
them.

03:36:32.679 --> 03:36:34.861
LAURA: Can we see where to go to? An opening?

03:36:34.861 --> 03:36:36.837
MATT: You can see it ascends upward out of view.

03:36:36.837 --> 03:36:38.752
LAURA: Let's just go.

03:36:38.752 --> 03:36:41.412
TALIESIN: This is what's happening. This is who we
are now.

03:36:41.412 --> 03:36:50.389
MATT: J'mon, they swoop down and the giant dragon
claws (clattering) grapple onto the rock side of

03:36:50.389 --> 03:36:57.382
this large titan and leans forward, giving each of
you the opportunity to jump a very short distance

03:36:57.382 --> 03:37:06.582
over to these steps. As each of you make this
leap, J'mon disengages and flies up and says, "I

03:37:06.582 --> 03:37:12.824
"can only grant you so much, for I have many to
watch out here as we distract he who resides

03:37:12.824 --> 03:37:20.627
"above. However, take this." As the dragon head
descends, you see the eyes flare with energy as

03:37:20.627 --> 03:37:46.701
they cast Mass Cure Wounds. Ooh, two sixes and a
seven, not bad. All right, 12, 19. That's going to

03:37:46.701 --> 03:37:51.925
be 28 hit points healed to both of you.

03:37:51.925 --> 03:37:53.674
TALIESIN: That helps.

03:37:53.674 --> 03:38:01.901
LIAM: Yeah, as we were landing, the gashes all
over Vax's face started to heal up a little bit,

03:38:01.901 --> 03:38:04.683
but not all the way. Then suddenly they went even
further.

03:38:04.683 --> 03:38:13.224
MATT: "Be safe, and I'll see you on the other
side."

03:38:13.224 --> 03:38:19.185
LAURA: (fake-crying) See you on the other side of
the war.

03:38:19.185 --> 03:38:27.197
MATT: As you all stand on the precipice of this
opening that falls off into a drop, hundreds of

03:38:27.197 --> 03:38:33.617
feet to the rocky ground below, you can smell the
cold wind blowing through these caverns, emerging

03:38:33.617 --> 03:38:38.433
from this entrance you've found. As Keyleth holds
back the flow of this river, you glance up the

03:38:38.433 --> 03:38:45.210
dark, rising stairs, deep into the body of the
titan amongst the cursed vaults of this dwarven

03:38:45.210 --> 03:38:53.664
city, long abandoned, and begin your trek to
eventually meet your final conflict with the

03:38:53.664 --> 03:38:56.214
Whispered One. That's where we're going to end
tonight's game.

03:38:56.214 --> 03:40:14.377
(extended cheering)

03:40:14.377 --> 03:40:15.792
BRIAN: Keep it up!

03:40:15.792 --> 03:40:17.446
MATT: This is a little surreal.

03:40:17.446 --> 03:40:26.364
BRIAN: Big time. There's some people that we
really want to thank really fast. It's our crew,

03:40:26.364 --> 03:40:36.827
and it's the people who helped put this on for us.
So we want to thank-- I had the list but I left it

03:40:36.827 --> 03:40:47.140
backstage because I was too involved in what was
going on. Okay. Dani, Sax, Courtney, Ryan, Rachel,

03:40:47.140 --> 03:41:05.453
Ed, Jamie, Danny, Ben, Chris, Fernando, Audrey.
You guys. It takes literally six months to put one

03:41:05.453 --> 03:41:13.298
of these on. The amount of work and heart and love
that our crew has put into this has been

03:41:13.298 --> 03:41:18.868
incredible. You guys are incredible!

03:41:18.868 --> 03:41:47.456
(cheering)

03:41:47.456 --> 03:41:53.160
BRIAN: Thank you for waiting, thank you for
coming, thank you for participating! Don't worry,

03:41:53.160 --> 03:41:59.067
it's almost Thursday. Good night, GenCon!

03:41:59.067 --> 03:42:35.279
(cheering)

03:42:35.279 --> 03:42:46.787
SAM: See you guys tomorrow. Get some sleep. Thanks
so much; this was a lot of fun!

03:42:46.787 --> 03:42:59.162
MATT: So just a reminder, guys, those of you who
will be able to come to the signing tomorrow,

03:42:59.162 --> 03:43:02.335
we'll see you there. If you can come at least to
pick up some Scanlan stickers, I think it'll be

03:43:02.335 --> 03:43:13.629
worth your while. I'm going to post some images of
what they look like. I think you'll be happy. It's

03:43:13.629 --> 03:43:20.532
high time you got the fuck out and went to sleep.
Thank you guys so much for joining us.

03:43:20.581 --> 03:43:23.213
TALIESIN: What time is the signing? That's
actually a real question.

03:43:23.213 --> 03:43:34.058
