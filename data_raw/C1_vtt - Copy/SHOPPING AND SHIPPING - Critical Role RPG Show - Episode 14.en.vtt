MATT: Hello everyone and welcome

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.670
to this evening's episode of Critical Role.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.540
Before we kick things off

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.320
we're going to do the videos in just a moment to intro

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.320
as we're waiting for a member to arrive.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.790
But before we get started tonight

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.720
we have a couple special giveaways

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.440
getting all the subscriber counts we can get.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.730
First off if we hit 3500 subscribers tonight

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.800
we're going to be giving away a player's handbook

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.610
signed by the cast of Critical Role,

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.160
a dicebox, and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.930
one of these fantastically reconstructed horns of Orcus

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.570
torn recently from forehead of the mad beholder K'varn.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.830
We actually have two of these

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.320
available tonight as part of the giveaways.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.080
The first one will be at 3500 the next one at 3550

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.890
with the same package:

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.430
The player's handbook signed by everybody

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.340
the dice box and one of these horn props

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.340
which were made for us by the incredible

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.210
KommissarProps.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.030
This is Kai Norman.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.220
Kai, want to come in and say hello to everyone?

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.170
KAI: Yeah!

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.050
MATT: Show off your good work here.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.330
KAI: Thank you.
MATT: Show off your good work here.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.400
KAI: Hey guys!

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.650
KAI: I guess I should show you

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.230
a little bit about how they're built.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.420
They're resin.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.850
They're cast resin so they've got a little bit of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.120
rigid foam in the back so they've got this nice kind of

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.130
bone marrow look

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.340
and they're all hand painted by me

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.110
and hopefully you guys will --

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.870
MARISHA: He's super awesome.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.020
MATT: It's a good start.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.290
MARISHA: You should totally go follow him

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.700
at KommissarProps.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.710
It's kind of hard so I printed this out for you guys.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.940
Follow him on Instagram and on Facebook.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.500
That's where you see the most about this guy.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.370
And go check it out. It's good for the giveaway.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.390
MATT: He's a talented guy.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.320
He's providing these for us for the giveaway tonight

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.100
totally on his own

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.550
and he's also going to be helping us

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.690
with future possible prop stuff

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.000
for the game as it progresses.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.800
MARISHA: You definitely want to go follow him.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.140
I actually tweeted a picture from your Instagram account,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.020
so for those of you who are following me,

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.750
there's a direct link to his Instagram account.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.640
Or just search this on Facebook or Instagram.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.300
MATT: Indeed.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.140
MARISHA: Do it. Do it now.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.220
MATT: So we have those at 3500 and 3550.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.050
If we get to 3600 tonight,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.230
you'll get the t-shirt signed, a dice box, a starter kit

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.670
and we'll stay after and play some more Just Dance.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.270
(cheers)

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.890
MATT: Yeah! Great!

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.400
MATT: Also want to give a big shoutout to --

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.980
we might have a bunch of new folks from imgur today --

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.090
someone put up a really cool post about us on imgur

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.960
and a lot of people saw it,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.020
so those who came through that, hello, welcome,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.610
you're gonna sit in and watch a bunch of us silly folk

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.400
play Dungeons &amp; Dragons,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.330
so it should be fun hopefully. Welcome.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.400
In the meantime we'll go ahead and roll the videos,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.150
we'll get some history on some of the characters

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.270
and we'll be back here in a few minutes.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.380
MARISHA: We'll be back. Go follow.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.760
And then we'll pull winners.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.370
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up! If you have ale,

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.300
then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw!

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.130
A goliath of towering height and size,

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.500
this barbarian has an appetite

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.220
for the two great loves in his life:

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.320
combat, women,

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.980
and ale!

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.950
(record scratch)

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.840
Wait.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.460
Easily the brains of the group,

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.920
Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.230
of shapes, colors, and shiny things!

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.700
...also ale.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.890
In his early years, armed with his two handed great axe,

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:25.390
Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.560
(brawling sounds)
Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.230
the ranks of his family's wandering herd.
(brawling sounds)

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.480
the ranks of his family's wandering herd.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.970
But after coming upon an unsuspecting

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.960
elderly gnome in the woods,

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.900
he objected to the killing such an innocent life.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.010
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this...

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.200
well, this terrified little thing.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.370
And his disobedience cost him dearly.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.320
(weapon crack)
Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.880
Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader,

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.500
his uncle Kevdak,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.940
Grog was abandoned and left to die.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.400
Exiled from his herd, it was then that

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.930
the relative of the very gnome he fought to save,

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.620
saved him.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.330
It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.360
that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.910
And they have remained close friends ever since.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.820
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.770
entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha!

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.770
...or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house,

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.050
where you pay for...

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.190
lady favors.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.470
Also ale!

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.820
MARISHA: A first Impression of Keyleth would

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.340
leave you with little information

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.090
on the half-elven druid.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.650
You might even think that her social awkwardness

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.090
due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.120
(chuckle)

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.630
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.750
based on first impressions.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.190
(thunder crack)
based on first impressions.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.720
Under that unintimidating petite frame

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.330
is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed,

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.080
whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.970
champions pee their pants, literally!

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.120
(soft chuckle)

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.060
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.060
Keyleth was raised with a deep love

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.620
of nature and the elemental magics.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.080
It is her peopleâ€™s inherent duty to protect

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.260
the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.170
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.860
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.970
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.410
Well, if you consider kittens and

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.690
flying squirrels to be little beasts.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:31.930
Which, I do.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:32.750
(clears throat)

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.250
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe,

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.760
her father, Kohren,

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.970
realized her true prodigious abilities

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.330
and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.610
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.210
and replaced with endless spell memorization,

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.920
teachings from ancient traditions,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.460
and exceedingly high expectations.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.700
Every druid leader to be must embark on

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.060
a journey to seek out the sister tribes

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.570
in order to introduce and establish respect

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.650
amongst the fellow headmasters.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.580
They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.540
When her father felt she was ready,

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.500
he set her on the path to truly discovering herself.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.140
Not knowing when, or if she will ever return.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.920
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.320
she meditated on the task ahead.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.790
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.750
a strong warrior, a valiant protector,

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.230
and a wise and compassionate leader.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:30.760
With this knowledge,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.320
one thought plays in repeat in her mind:

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.940
Is she even worthy?

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.230
TALIESIN: Percy was the third child of seven children,

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.000
born to a noble family who lived far to the north

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.430
in the ancient castle of Whitestone.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.690
With so many siblings to share the burdens of

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.000
lordship, Percy turned his attention to the

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.400
sciences, engineering, and naturalism.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.810
One day, a mysterious couple,

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.540
named Lord and Lady Briarwood, came to court.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.540
During a feast held in their honour,

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.690
the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle,

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.640
killing or imprisoning everyone

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.540
who would stand in their way.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.650
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon,

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.220
only to be freed by his younger sister.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.760
Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoodsâ€™ men.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.150
As they ran, Percyâ€™s sister took

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.900
several arrows to the chest and fell.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.410
Percy kept running, eventually jumping into

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.900
a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.800
He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.840
He barely remembered the next two years,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.810
as he slowly made his way as far south as possible.

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.420
Then one night, Percy had a dream.

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:42.120
A roaring cloud of smoke offered him

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.260
vengeance against those who destroyed his family.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.220
When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.580
(gun cocks and fires)

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.990
ASHLEY: Pike grew up in the outskirts of town,

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.350
near the Bramblewood.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.970
Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.820
with quite an unfavorable reputation.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.020
Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.810
with the curse of the last name Trickfoot.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.800
Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption,

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.380
had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather, Wilhand,

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.010
who left his family at a young age after a dream.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.300
A dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.890
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.260
and pledged from then on that him and his family

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.450
would live a life of service and devotion.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:33.320
As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.210
Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers,

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.120
she felt she had a purpose in making things whole

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.010
that had once been broken.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.010
She studied and learned the ways to heal

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.570
though divine magic.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.010
She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple,

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.340
until one day, Wilhand was captured

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.800
and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.530
One of the goliaths took a stand

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.450
against the murder of the innocent gnome

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:02.050
and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead,

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.300
abandoned by his herd.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.640
Wilhand went to Pike for help.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.950
She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could,

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.460
bringing him back to life.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.720
When he awoke, she discovered his name

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.870
was Grog Strongjaw.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.370
After that, they were best of friends,

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.370
a rather unlikely pair.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.790
Little did she know that in a few years' time

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.660
Grog would soon return the favor

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.400
and bring her back from the clutches of death.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.600
(creature growl and snapping)

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.400
After being killed in battle,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.850
Pike felt angry.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.250
She wanted to be stronger

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.980
so that it would never happen again.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.280
She spent four months at sea

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.800
training with the men and women

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.730
aboard a ship called the Broken Howl.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.330
Gripping her holy symbol in one hand,

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.490
and her morningstar in the other,

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.730
this time, Pike is ready.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.810
SAM: Oh, you havenâ€™t heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:00.690
Well, gird your loins, ladies,

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.620
because he has his eye on you.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.100
A talented musician, master of disguise,

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.410
and dashingly handsome in his own mind,

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.900
Scanlan sings songs

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.970
almost as much as he sings his own praises.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.580
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.850
his endless charm and soaring tenor voice

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:20.020
to croon for coin and support his single mother.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.860
One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter,

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.780
and joined Dr. Dranzelâ€™s Spectacular Traveling Troupe

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.610
where he learned the ways of the world

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.320
and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.210
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.340
come to terms with the violent death of his mother

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.780
at the hands of a goblin invasion.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:43.160
While his years on the road provided many, shall we say,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.660
educational experiences with the opposite sex,

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.160
deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.530
heâ€™s never known:

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.180
the true love of a fellow Gnome.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.050
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first,

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.010
performer second, and fighter distant third.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.770
On the battlefield, heâ€™ll support his allies,

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.780
but rarely draws blood unless itâ€™s to protect

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.540
fellow gnome, Pike.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.690
Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh,

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.560
a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.970
that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.660
ORION: Greetings and salutations.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.750
I am Tiberius Stormwind.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.920
I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.920
located in the heart of Draconia,

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.330
born from a politically respected family.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.510
At the age of 15,

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.970
I succeeded in passing the Sorcererâ€™s Rite,

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.260
showing prodigy-like control of my magic.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.970
The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.560
at how powerful my spells were

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.330
for how long I had been training.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.060
At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.530
of the magic guild in Draconian history.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.610
For the next few years, I almost went mad

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.070
from the malaise of being a guild member,

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.880
as itâ€™s rather boring.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.640
However, one day I happened upon a chamber,

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.410
unused for quite some time.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.020
In the room were stacks of books and maps

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.540
of the surrounding cities and areas

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.860
around the known world.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.200
For months, I would frequent the chamber

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.220
and learned of artifacts from legend.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.900
After a long period of research,

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.500
I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.550
I brought these findings to the high council

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.360
and was told that all of the information

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.240
in the chamber I had stumbled upon

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.850
was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries,

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:22.650
and hence were lost forever.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.320
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.530
A year later I devised a ruse

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.100
and managed to convince the city council

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.280
to lend support in me leaving Draconia

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.180
on a mission of peace and diplomacy

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.570
for the surrounding kingdoms.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.160
Going from town to town and making friends and allies,

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.970
in and for the name of Draconia.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:40.890
Being a red dragonborn,

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.920
I had quite the task on my hands in that respect,

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.480
but it was exactly what I needed

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.400
so I could explore the world and find these artifacts,

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.060
as I felt the truth was out there.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.400
Some may describe me as buffoonish,

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.770
but I say poppycock to all that.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.170
I am much sharper than most give me credit for.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.240
I just donâ€™t pay attention to things sometimes.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.910
Iâ€™ve also been known to be rather cunning, loyal,

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.220
happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.380
I canâ€™t help but show my true scales every now and then.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.980
But overall, I think Iâ€™m quite friendly for a Dragonborn.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.820
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men,

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.800
Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.970
preferring instead to invite himself in your door.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.310
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia,

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.970
Vax was born by a chance encounter between

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.640
elven royalty and human peasantry.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.410
Raised by their mother in their early years,

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.980
the twins were eventually sent off

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.710
to their father in the Elven capital of Singorn.

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.330
But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed,

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.880
and their time in the capital didnâ€™t last.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.430
The siblings stole away one autumn night

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.430
and set out on the open road.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.740
After a few years of wandering,

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.570
they eventually decided to return to their mother,

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.080
and journeyed back to the lands of their youth.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.290
But instead of finding their childhood home,

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.410
they returned to a pile of rubble.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:09.130
Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.000
Pressing the townspeople for answers,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.260
they learned of the day the dragon came.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.090
(roaring)

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.290
With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.990
set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:28.190
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:32.000
to solve lifeâ€™s challenges in his own particular way,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.820
often by sidestepping them entirely.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.360
And when his knack for circumventing adversity isnâ€™t enough,

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.160
(sword unsheathing and slashing)

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.860
the way of blades the elves schooled him in

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.980
more than makes up the difference.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.890
LAURA: Like so many half-elves,

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.610
Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:54.680
the cool reception of a people who donâ€™t fully accept her.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.110
Born of a human mother and an elven father

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:01.520
who only later in life took an interest in their existence,

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.580
Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.680
quickly realized the only people

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.680
they could truly rely on in this world

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.360
were each other.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.030
It was at the age of 10 when the two were taken

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.860
from their mother, and brought to live in Singorn,

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.860
the isolated Elven city for which

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.940
their father was an ambassador.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:25.310
He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance,

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.240
and after too many years of disdainful looks,

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.660
the pair decided to leave his indifference behind

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.400
and set out on their own.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.920
Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.200
and learning the ways of the thief,

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.650
while Vex kept to the woods.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.180
She preferred the isolation.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.080
Always the keen observer,

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:51.800
she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.460
And through a series of fateful events,

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:58.250
earned herself a companion in the form of a bear --

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.370
her own stolen Trinket --

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.970
to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:09.310
Also he is adorable and gives expert massages.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.820
MATT: Welcome back guys!

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.540
We have some interesting aspects of playing tonight

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.640
Orion Acaba will be here shortly,

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.990
he's currently stuck in traffic.

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.330
Unfortunately we will not have a Sam Riegel tonight,

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.810
due to his schedule.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:29.970
ASHLEY: Scanlan?!

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:30.480
MARISHA: No Scanlan.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.030
MATT: Laura Bailey and Travis Willingham,

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.800
our loving Grog and Vex, are out of town in Florida

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.240
but are Skyping in via modern technology.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.450
LAURA: Technology? What's it all about?

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.220
MARISHA: We can actually see you guys pretty good.
MATT: We're going to try and make this work.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:45.640
MARISHA: It's pretty cool.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.450
ZAC: We're getting audio set up right now.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.090
MATT: So we're getting this figured out.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.210
They'll stay in play as long as they can.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.120
They are three hours ahead of us.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.630
To be fair, we have friends across the coast

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.850
that get up at 4am to watch this

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.170
LAURA: That's true.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:00.580
MATT: You should hang around long as you can.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.170
(strange monkey noises)
MATT: You should hang around long as you can.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:02.980
MATT: We can't hear you right now.
(strange monkey noises)

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.300
(more monkey noises)
MATT: It's even better.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.170
MATT: So as they're figuring this out guys.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:07.740
We'll let you know,

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.020
we've already hit our first milestone for subs.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.970
MATT: So we have a winner. The winner of our first package,

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:16.140
which includes the player's handbook signed by everybody,

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.370
the dice, and one horn of Orcus

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.650
torn from the forehead of K'varn...

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:23.840
Is the esteemed RhymesWithOrange!

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.100
Congratulations RhymesWithOrange,

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.530
you are the first winner of the horn.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.970
(everyone claps)

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.210
MATT: Well done.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:31.070
So we'll get that sent out --

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.720
TALIESIN: Are you taking a selfie with the iPad?

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.520
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.860
TALIESIN: Sorry.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.410
MATT: (sighs)

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:37.050
TALIESIN: Sorry.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:37.900
MATT: It's alright. So --

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.130
MARISHA: Thank you again to our friend

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:43.970
Kai Norman at KommissarProps for making the horn,

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.060
go follow him. It's awesome.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.170
KommisarProps on Instagram and Facebook

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.160
MATT: Our next giveaway is at 3550.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.720
And we will give away the second and only other horn,

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.800
as well as the rest of that package.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.720
And at 3600 we're going to do

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.930
t-shirt signed, dice box, starter kit

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.230
and we're going to be dancing for you afterwards.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:04.840
Let's see if we can get that by tonight.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.580
Also, want to give you guys a heads up,

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.460
we've wanted to get some confirmation

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.910
to you guys about the episode releases after the live show.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:14.020
Because we have a lot of people who watch the show

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.870
who can't watch it live.

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:17.780
MATT: The episodes are available immediately

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.700
afterward on Twitch if you're a subscriber.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.090
So the morning after the show, if you're a subscriber,

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.990
you get to watch the episodes immediately afterward.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.580
Plus you're helping us keep this channel going.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.760
All the subscription money goes toward

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.540
maintaining the channel,

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.210
all the people that work here throughout the week,

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.410
all the other amazing hosts and people

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:35.100
that actually run the programs here.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.100
So you help make this channel function.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.610
MARISHA: Only subscribers get access to the archives.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:41.620
MATT: -- archives immediately.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.190
However --

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.120
LAURA: (coughs)
However --

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.780
MATT: -- volume.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.780
MATT: To finish this thought, for those who aren't subscribers,

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.780
episodes do go up now every Monday,

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.580
that's going to be the confirmed time period of release.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.770
MATT: So you can look forward to episodes

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.770
up on the Geek &amp; Sundry website every Monday.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.410
That's the scenario.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:05.480
MATT: So, given that case,

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.610
whenever Orion gets here he'll hop in,

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:08.840
in the meantime, let's go ahead and start this game up.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:09.780
MATT: So.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.560
ASHLEY: All right here we go.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.050
MATT: So, for those of us who --

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:14.940
MATT: Just a little heads up here,

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:19.130
the party has just returned after a long arduous trek

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:20.100
through The Underdark,

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.020
beneath the Dwarven city of Kraghammer.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.570
MATT: They were sent to retrieve a paladin named

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:28.360
Lady Kima of Vord, who was on a vision quest

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.930
to stop some dark evil that her deity Bahamut

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.320
told her was existing beneath this mountain range,

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.020
and needed to be squelched.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.680
MATT: The party managed to salvage her from insidious torture,

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:43.520
and through her aid as well as a Mind Flayer

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.460
who had been outcast from the society

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.020
and the colony nearby.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.020
MATT: They managed to convince to help them as well,

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.460
fought their way through the tunnels,

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.920
past the Duergar army, eventually to

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:56.670
the underground Mindflayer colony of Yogg Voril

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.840
where they found that this entity called K'varn.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.200
This was then eventually revealed

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.810
to be a mad beholder, K'varn,

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:06.410
who had been pseudo possessed

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.370
and given additional power by the Horn of Orcus,

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.680
a great and evil artifact long forgotten,

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.810
which had been found by this entity.

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:15.640
So they managed to make their way

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.400
into the temple, kill K'varn,

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.060
tear the horn from it's forehead,

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.200
however found themselves swarmed immediately

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.150
by an entire colony of mind flayers

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.680
heading toward the top of this temple.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.460
They managed to battle and battle,

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.160
nearly losing a few party members,

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.220
and through some ingenuity, escape through the top,

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:33.450
glide over the city of Yogg Voril

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.900
through this underground chasm to a distant embankment

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:39.400
along the beachside of this underground lake.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.330
And teleport their way back to their base city of Emon.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:45.210
So they've come back to Emon,

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.400
they've come to their keep, Greyskull Keep,

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.210
and they've had an evening of rest.

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:51.790
Upon waking the next morning,

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.790
they've managed to get some breakfast,

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:56.290
they've freed Lady Kima from her stone entrapment

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.100
as she was turned to stone

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.600
during the battle with the beholder,

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.990
and had a conversation based around

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.970
what should or could be done

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.640
about this Horn of Orcus evil artifact.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.040
So here we will pick up again from that point.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.880
So the rest of you guys have eaten your meal,

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:16.500
Kima hungrily doing so.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.840
All of you guys both sore and exhausted

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.290
having barely seen sunlight for a little over a week

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.990
and being probably the first or second good meal

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:27.660
you've had since leaving Kraghammer proper.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.260
You all finish your food, Grog hungrily so,

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.940
double the size of his normal intake of

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.730
delicious meats and starches.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.760
Tiberius has not seemed to have woken up

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.820
or found his way down from his room as of yet.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.780
However, you guys did recently receive

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.680
a rolled up piece of parchment.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.340
A notification from the council of Talâ€™Dorei,

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.170
saying that you have been requested to

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:55.000
the council chambers at some point this afternoon,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.960
around the mid-day sun, to discuss your return

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.920
and the situation and conditions about it.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.140
And that was all it said.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.270
LIAM: I can't remember is Lady Kima with us at this point?

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:09.240
Is she unstoned?

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:09.880
MATT: She's unstoned,

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.730
you've already had the conversation with her last week

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.920
talking about the horn, basically interrogating her.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.610
LIAM: And we said that we had it somewhere safe,

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:20.910
but weren't we playing coy with that?

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:21.700
MATT: You were playing coy with it but you --

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.640
ASHLEY: I had gone downstairs to go get Grog.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.200
MATT: Yes, Grog returned with it

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.570
and you guys had the conversation basically saying

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:28.210
â€˜Oh, it's safe, don't worry. It's fineâ€™.

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:30.010
Grog at which currently has it in the bag of holding.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.410
MARISHA: But we haven't told her

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.320
that it's in the bag of holding right?

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.560
MATT: No you just said you have it somewhere safe.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.550
MARISHA: We just said we have it somewhere safe.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:38.360
MATT: Correct.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.230
MARISHA: Okay.

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:44.350
MATT: Turn them up a little bit.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.630
TALIESIN: I am highly entertained.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:47.200
LIAM: I think we're getting feedback.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.060
MATT: Oh, I see.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.180
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that's us.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.590
LAURA: Right! That would be us.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:53.460
MATT: Yes.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.480
LAURA: Sorry about that.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.330
ASHLEY: We'll figure this out guys.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:57.380
MARISHA: That wasn't too bad.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.980
MATT: This is the new attempt at technology

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:01.710
with our out-of-towners.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:04.610
TALIESIN: It's amazing.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:05.470
MARISHA: It's working pretty well.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:06.180
TALIESIN: It is working pretty well.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.720
MARISHA: I'm kind of impressed.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.400
PERCY: Have we actually opened up the parchment

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.450
and read it yet?

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:13.560
MATT: Yes, you have received it and you've inspected it.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.690
ASHLEY: It's Tiberius.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.750
ORION: Hey everybody.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:19.970
MARISHA: Yes.

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:21.440
LAURA: Hey boo.
TALIESIN: I don't know what's going to happen.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.620
MATT: He's going to crawl under the table.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:23.630
There you have it.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:27.780
LIAM: Good morning sleepyhead.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.500
ORION: Hi guys.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.890
MATT: As a couple hours have passed --

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.190
KEYLETH: Good morning Tiberius.

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:34.190
ORION: Hi. Right.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.510
TIBERIUS: Hello.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.220
ORION: Am I here?

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.240
LIAM: Yes you've just come down the stairs.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.170
MATT: You've just now come down

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:42.900
after many hours of breakfast have passed.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.430
It's now pushing around 11:00

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.650
in the afternoon comparatively,

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:47.810
and Tiberius comes storming

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:50.090
into the main dining hall of your keep.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.780
TIBERIUS: Morning everyone.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.700
KEYLETH: What is that?

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.810
TIBERIUS: This is my own bag of holding.

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:00.880
ORION: And I walk over to Grog

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.660
and I open their bag of holding

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:08.010
and take out my wheel of mending and I put it in here.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:11.960
VEX: You got your own bag of holding?!

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.000
TIBERIUS: That's what I needed the extra gold for before I left.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.220
KEYLETH: Where did you go to get that?

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.570
ORION: We're face-timing?
KEYLETH: Where did you go to get that?

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.250
ORION: Hey! Hi Guys!

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:23.730
TALIESIN: Science.

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:25.010
LIAM: We are the coolest.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:27.490
ORION: I was like that's, "That's Laura's voice,

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:28.740
where the hell is that coming from?"

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.800
ASHLEY: At least we think we're cool.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.740
MARISHA: At least we think we're cool.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.220
ORION: Travis is there too! Sorry!

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.220
TIBERIUS: I mean.. Yes.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:39.220
VAX: So Tiberius we're just waiting for you to awake.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.640
I think we should probably go

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.580
and see the emperor, like you do.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.300
Talk about the little problem we have.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:51.100
KEYLETH: Wait.  Where did you go and get a bag of holding

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.950
in the time of us sleeping and you waking up.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:59.630
TIBERIUS: If you recall, I actually went to Draconia...

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:01.100
when we all woke up to begin with.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.930
KEYLETH: You didn't tell us that.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.600
TIBERIUS: Why would I have to tell you?

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.040
KEYLETH: I didn't say you didn't have to,

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.040
I'm just saying you acted like I should know

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.010
and I'm saying I had no idea.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:10.980
ORION: I could have sworn I cast that

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:11.980
and said that last game.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.820
MATT: No, you just stayed in your room and did it on your own.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:14.400
ORION: Oh shit.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.380
(all laugh)

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.610
MARISHA: Yeah. So right now you're crazy to me.

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:19.780
ORION: Right. Okay.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.100
PERCY: I'm also a little disturbed that

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.470
it looks like that bag of holding is made of you.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:24.900
KEYLETH: Yes it does look like it's made of drag --

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.700
that seems cruel.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.650
TIBERIUS: Actually this is wyvern skin.

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:32.340
We use it in the air force of the Draconian army.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:32.960
And when the --

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.320
ASHLEY: Air force?

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.450
TIBERIUS: Yes. Draconia has an army,

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.900
500 standing, 200 are airborne.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.840
KEYLETH: But they have an air force?

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:42.400
TIBERIUS: Yes.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.520
Keyleth: Do they fly-- nevermind.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.040
PERCY: No, they just blow, they force air.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:46.900
KEYLETH: (laughs)

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.380
TIBERIUS: We have trained and tamed wyverns

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:55.060
which we have utilized and they are part of our culture.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.620
PERCY: I've never seen a skinned one.

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:01.730
TIBERIUS: Yes. And so I went to the local "shoppe"

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:06.320
and purchased a bag of holding because I realized

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:10.350
that I did not hold my own wheel of mending for a long time.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.570
PERCY: That was frustrating you, wasn't it?

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.640
TIBERIUS: It was extremely frustrating.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.460
Especially because it's my artifact.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:20.820
TIBERIUS: Yes.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.640
KEYLETH: Well that's good.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.560
It's probably good to have a second one of those.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.710
KEYLETH: And it comes with water, how handy.

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.820
TIBERIUS: It holds a lot of things!

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.180
KEYLETH: How fantastic.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.010
PERCY: We should probably get off to see

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.690
what the emperor wants.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.060
TIBERIUS: Before we do that --

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.200
ORION: Where's Scanlan now?

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:37.820
KEYLETH: Not here.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.700
MATT: Scanlan is currently in the room eating breakfast

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.160
ORION: We're all eating breakfast still right?

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:41.900
MATT: Yeah.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.460
ORION: Hi everybody.

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:47.970
LIAM: Not you, you've apparently been globe shopping.

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:53.310
TIBERIUS: Right. Scanlan?

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:57.010
I was thinking about our last encounter.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:58.440
ORION: I'm going to

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.480
take off my ion stone that's kinda chilling.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.670
TIBERIUS: This is a particular thing that you've seen

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:05.940
me use several times.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.060
And I notice in the last

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.780
couple of battles you've actually literally

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.670
run out of spells to cast.

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.150
I propose a friendly trade.

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.200
The crown on your head allows you to do certain things

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.330
which you have not utilized the last several rounds

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:18.280
you've owned it.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.210
It seems you've actually complained about

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:22.090
not having extra spells to cast.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:23.130
VAX: Rounds of what?

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.080
TIBERIUS: --rounds of battle, Vax.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:26.670
VAX: Oh.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:27.640
ORION: I don't know.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.170
(all laugh)

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.740
TIBERIUS: So I assume that you could probably actually

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.770
use this more.

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:39.800
I have a tool that allows me to do it to begin with

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.960
and it's come in rather handy as you've seen.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.220
What say you, Scanlan?

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.340
MATT: Scanlan looks to you and thinks for a second and goes

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:49.820
SCANLAN: You know what.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.010
I'm going to think on that.

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:52.210
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.380
SCANLAN: Wait untill I'm more

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:59.250
rested and solid and sound mind before I can make

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:01.450
any sort of arrangements or trades here.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.650
It would be unfair, given our current state of --

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.620
(all laugh)

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.260
VAX: It's true Scanlan, you should probably wait

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.720
until you're feeling a little more present.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.420
PIKE: Wonderful plan Scanlan.
SCANLAN: Agreed, agreed.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.920
SCANLAN: A couple hours at the local brothel

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.010
and all should be fine.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.380
MATT: He cracks his fingers, expectantly.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.650
VAX: Welcome back, even though we didn't know you were gone.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:23.370
I've eaten. The rest of us have eaten --

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:25.220
PIKE: Were you gone all night?

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.770
TIBERIUS: No, just for about an hour.

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:27.320
KEYLETH: Oh.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.640
TIBERIUS: It was a good trip. I needed it.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.860
PIKE: Just saying hello to family and that?

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.730
TIBERIUS: No I just literally went to a shop I knew in Draconia

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:33.970
and picked up the item.

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:35.180
I wasn't sure if they had any in Emon

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:37.740
and didn't really want to waste any time looking for one.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:39.740
PIKE: Well...

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.490
VAX: Good on you, shall we go to meet the emperor?

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.700
PERCY: I've eaten, let's politic.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.880
VAX: I think so.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:49.940
MATT: All right.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.300
TALIESIN: This is so --

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.300
MATT: Can you guys hear us fine?

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.040
LAURA: Yeah.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:58.060
MATT: Just making sure.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.970
LAURA: Too scared to talk is all.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:01.530
MARISHA: Scared to talk?

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:02.990
LIAM: Chime in, please.

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.890
MATT: Feel free to chime in whenever.

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:04.760
LIAM: One of us, one of us.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.600
GROG: Balls. Taint. Ale. Nipples.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.850
MATT: That's our Grog.

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:12.180
ASHLEY: Hey, there's Grog.

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:14.200
MARISHA: Grog!

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:17.330
MATT: As our wonderful giant, now filled with

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:20.700
various forms of delicious food matter warm in his belly,

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:24.000
gives a string of various curse words in enjoyment,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.710
and sits up from the table with a loud fart

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:28.670
and you guys make your way out of Greyskull Keep.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.310
MATT: Towards the outer wall of Emon,

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:32.990
in towards the entrance to Abedar's Promenade,

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:34.990
making your way towards the Cloudtop District

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.760
where the palace itself resides. Is there any place --

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.120
LAURA: Is Lady Kima with us?

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.560
MATT: Lady Kima is with you, yes.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.540
TALIESIN: Good.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.440
MATT: Is there anything else you want to do

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.440
or are you guys making a beeline for the palace?

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:50.820
ORION: I would like to take another

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.390
500 gold from the treasury before we do that.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:54.640
And I do.

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:56.030
MATT: Okay.

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:56.940
LAURA: Wait, what?

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:57.940
LIAM: From the treasury.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.460
VAX: You have to ask the treasurer.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.340
VEX: How much do you want?

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:05.320
TIBERIUS: Five hundred to replenish the

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.710
500 that I initially took.

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.210
I donâ€™t know if I will have to spend it at all, and if I do,

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:14.020
I will completely share my plan with all of you.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.260
But I would like to see how what we do plays out next.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:19.630
VEX: Another 500?

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.010
TIBERIUS: Yes.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:25.040
ORION: That's all I do. That's all I want to do.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:26.570
MATT: Anything else?

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.890
VAX: Have we had contact with Allura? Since returning?

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:31.260
MATT: Nuh uh.

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:31.740
VAX: Not yet?

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:36.580
LIAM: I feel good about her being at this meeting.

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.000
PIKE: Someone just got really excited

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.410
when we mentioned the name Allura.

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:42.290
ORION: I cast prestidigitation on myself

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:44.530
and make robes are all super clean and nice.

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:45.400
MATT: Got you.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.900
MATT: As you guys walk into the center of the Cloudtop District,

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.230
you can see that her ivory tower,

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:52.720
which once collapsed around you,

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.000
is now standing in it's previous location,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.450
seemingly untouched and back to it's original esteemed visual.

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.140
PERCY: That is the question, do we stop in first

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.530
or do we go straight to --

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:06.260
VAX: Was there a time requested on there?

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.830
MATT: It said around the noon day sun.

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:11.760
It's probably about 30 minutes give or take.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.650
VAX: Allura's really the only person I trust.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:16.620
PERCY: Perhaps we should not walk into the palace

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:19.080
with this on us, so to speak.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:21.960
VAX: We don't have anything on us.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.420
PERCY: No, we don't, but if we did

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.910
we should probably deal with it.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:26.210
PERCY: What.

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:26.700
VAX: Yes.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.430
PERCY: No. Yes. (laughs)

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:32.650
VAX: Tibbsy. Let's go ring Allura's bell.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.630
GROG: I'd like to ring her bell.

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:40.580
TALIESIN: It's like having the internet right there.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:45.400
LIAM: So I just start walking off towards Allura's tower.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.020
ORION: I'll follow Vax.

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.110
MATT: Okay. Everyone else go with them?

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.750
PERCY: Yeah.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:49.930
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:51.520
MATT: So you guys trek your way towards

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.930
the northern edge of the Cloudtop District.

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:54.420
You round about the series of

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.460
very nice, fine marbled houses, finely crafted stone.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.430
This is the affluent area of Emon proper.

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:04.050
It's in the secondary city wall, which of course

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:06.210
the upper echelon of merchants

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:08.130
and those who have money are offered

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:09.710
the secondary form of defense

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:11.780
against the town being sieged at all.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.100
MATT: You come around the corner on the fine kind of

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.530
yellowish cobblestone road, turn,

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:18.890
and you get to the point where you can see

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:21.570
to the left of you is the giant courtyard that

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.570
surrounds the outskirts of the palace proper.

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:24.670
With the giant steps that lead up

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:26.670
to the darkened purple marble

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.770
that the entire structure is made out of.

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:30.340
To your right, there's a few buildings

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:35.220
and the white ivory tower that Allura lives in.

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.120
You approach, the front door is closed.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.660
It still remains that giant iron knocker on the front

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:41.810
that hangs loosely, like a giant wishbone

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:44.810
that you slam into the front of the wooden doorway.

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:45.440
MATT: Give it a couple hits?

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.140
(Vax nods)

00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.970
MATT: You can hear it echo throughout the interior

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:51.950
of the tall standing tower.

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:54.810
A few moments pass,

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:56.580
you hear the movement of chain.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:58.970
A creaking of metal and then a --

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:04.640
some sort of large shifting of a wood platform or plank.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.910
The door then creaks open

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.950
and there standing, a little bleary eyed,

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:11.950
slept-in a bit, but in the process of getting ready,

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:14.020
you see before you Arcanist Allura.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.540
Her long blonde hair is half braided.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.610
She's in her darkened blue robes.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:20.210
You're used to seeing her in and see --

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:22.170
She opens the door, the sunlight hitting her eye.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:24.820
She protects her vision for a second

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.130
before they focus on the rest of the group and she goes,

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:30.650
ALLURA: "My lord, you've all arrived!

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:31.620
"You've all arrived!"

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:33.060
MATT: And she swings the door opens

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.280
and runs forward immediately to you,

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.460
the first person that's there and she gives you a big hug.

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:38.660
MATT: She holds back and gives you a look over.

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:41.680
MATT: Her eyes are opened.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.980
You can see how honestly eager

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.650
and happy to see that everyone's here safe.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:48.370
LIAM: I look over at Tiberius and just short of sheepishly shrug.

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:50.020
TIBERIUS: I'm used to it, it's fine.

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.810
MATT: She turns over to give Pike a big hug.

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:54.650
She makes her way around the rest of the group.

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:57.820
ALLURA: "You're all... I'm so glad to see you're all back.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.330
"I've heard there was some difficulties

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:02.580
"happening in Kraghammer at the time you arrived."

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.200
MATT: She turns around and takes your hands, Keyleth,

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.700
into her own and gives you a nod and a small hug.

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.460
Goes to Percy and gives you a hug.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.920
Goes to Tiberius and gives you a big warm hug.

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:17.560
MATT: She slowly pulls away.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.750
She acquiesces to your longer hug...

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:22.850
And then... pushes away.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:25.050
TIBERIUS: It is nice to see you again.

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:26.130
ALLURA: "The pleasure is mine."

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:26.940
VEX: (sings) Awkward.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:27.860
Everyone: (laughs)

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.250
ALLURA: "The pleasure is mine, Tiberius."

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.220
MATT: And as she turns around,

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.450
she sees standing behind the rest of you, there's Kima.

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:36.170
There in her now freshly cleaned golden armor

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:37.530
that she polished over the evening so she doesn't

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:41.040
smell of Duergar sweat and blood anymore.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.640
VAX: We've brought you a present.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.780
MATT: There's this moment where they both look at each other quietly.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:48.810
And then Allura steps forward and says,

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.910
ALLURA: "Kima. Welcome back."

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:54.250
MATT: And they both just run and give this

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:56.340
big embracing bear hug.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.300
She lifts Kima up and there's a slow spin.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:03.620
You can see this very very strong bond of friendship

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.700
before she eventually puts Kima down and

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.400
takes a little bit, she holds her hands for a second.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.570
You can see a tear running down Allura's cheek.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.630
ALLURA: "I was so worried about you."

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:14.300
MATT: And Kima sheepishly turns her eyes to the side and says,

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.450
KIMA: "Sorry for the all the trouble."

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.960
TIBERIUS: Story of my life.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.320
(all laugh)

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.760
ORION: Seriously Matthew?! Come on!

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:29.480
MATT: What?!

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.660
(all laugh)

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:31.950
MATT: They're good friends.

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:33.150
LIAM: Friends! Friends!

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:34.280
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:34.960
ORION: Friends.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:37.420
MATT: Your assumptions, dragonborn.

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:38.250
(all laugh)

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:41.150
LIAM: Don't mug yourself.

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.900
TALIESIN: That's great.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.820
LIAM: Come correct. Don't mug yourself.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:51.970
MATT: (laughs)

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.580
MATT: They take a moment to just nod at each other.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:59.140
She reaches her hand out in front of Kima's head

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.470
and rustles her hair for a second and says,

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:02.670
ALLURA: "You had many of us worried sick

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:04.140
"you can't keep running off like that."

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:04.780
MATT: And Kima says,

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.580
KIMA: "I know, I know."

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.680
MATT: Then Allura turns to the rest of the group and says,

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.470
ALLURA: "Thank you all so, so very much.

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:13.180
"You've done the realm and myself

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.980
"a great service in bringing her back."

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.460
MATT: At which point, Kima says,

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.200
KIMA: "Bring me back?

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.960
"They helped me complete my quest!

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:23.150
"You've made some strong allies, Allie."

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:27.010
MATT: And Allura starts heading back into her tower and says,

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:28.110
KEYLETH: Allie?
MATT: And Allura starts heading back into her tower and says,

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:28.850
ALLURA: "Well? Come. Enter. I have tea ready.

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:29.820
VEX: I like it.
ALLURA: "Well? Come. Enter. I have tea ready.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.800
ALLURA: "Well? Come. Enter. I have tea ready.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.530
"You all look like you could use it to be honest."

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:35.080
PIKE: Yeah.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:35.790
ALLURA: "Come. Please."

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:36.650
PERCY: Well, all right.

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:37.330
TIBERIUS: I love tea.

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:38.500
PERCY: We have a moment we can spend.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.740
VAX: Long story.

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:44.110
MATT: So as you guys all walk into her tower, you remember it

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:47.330
untouched from your previous entry here.

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:48.810
It's a weird moment to step into a tower

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:51.890
that you were once in as it crumbled and folded on itself,

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:53.890
to see it as if nothing had ever happened.

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:55.440
TALIESIN: Is there a new rug?

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.130
MATT: There is not.

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:57.690
TALIESIN: Ah-hah!

00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:58.940
LAURA: Hmm..

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:00.990
MARISHA: We're not giving it back.

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:01.810
LAURA: We shouldn't tell her about the rug.

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:03.060
MARISHA: Don't tell her about the rug.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:08.730
MATT: You guys step into the center of the room and she's

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:10.880
talking to herself for a moment, saying

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.040
ALLURA: "Things have been a bit crazy here, obviously.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.300
"Now that the floodgates have opened as far as

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.130
"discussions with the council and people who have

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:23.410
"maintained a backlog for a while. It's been a bit busy.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:25.570
"But, this is a wonderful moment to respite.

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:27.980
"I'm greatly enjoying the company to be honest.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:29.440
"Come."

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.410
MATT: She guides you all to the center of the chamber.

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.540
Once again, there's that large stone platform in the center

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.010
that has a number of the

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:37.740
inert runes carved into the stonework.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.050
As you all step onto it,

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:41.710
she taps her heel against the bottom of it for a second.

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:44.400
As she does, all the runes glow with a bright flash of blue

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.360
and a familiar sensation as that circular platform

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.180
begins to lift like an arcane elevator,

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.730
up the center of the tower,

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:52.320
going up one, two, three stories.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.800
And as you're going up you're seeing

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.800
certain sections of

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.990
wooden library shelves set up at odd angles

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:03.760
along the top of the arcane tower itself.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.700
You can see there are small stairways

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.810
that lead off into doorways that seem to almost

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:09.650
exit into the sky.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.770
MATT: You've gotten into the idea that a lot of these

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:16.440
powerful mage-built towers, the

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:20.100
inner workings don't really match the outer exterior look.

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.890
And there are rooms that shouldn't exist

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:23.570
at certain points as you lift up.

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:26.560
LIAM: I'd like to make a perfunctory insight check

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.460
just to see if there's anything hinky.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.780
ORION: I'd like to google perfunctory real quick.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:32.900
MATT: You can do that. Go for it.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:33.540
LIAM: Okay.

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:34.430
MATT: On Allura?

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:37.310
LIAM: Yeah, everything's probably fine.

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.110
That's an 18.

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:47.490
MATT: Best that you can gather, she looks

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:49.960
like she's a bit groggy, having slept in recently.

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.320
But she seems extremely excited you've all

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.680
returned and seems eager to catch up

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.330
as far as what has transpired since last you met her.

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.540
MATT: The platform continues before it reaches

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:03.380
the topmost floor of the tower before

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.930
the slowing of the stone platform

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:08.010
eventually comes to a halt with a slight jostling.

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:09.500
The runes fade and you're all

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:10.890
on the top floor of the tower once again.

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:11.970
This is her main chamber.

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:14.100
You can see across the way there is

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.850
her large cush canopy bed in the far corner.

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:18.410
There are a number of desks.

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:21.860
There's a small arcane laboratory on the far side.

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.530
Looks like it's in a bit of disarray,

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.140
as she's probably in the middle of a project.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.880
MATT: You do hear, as soon as you arrive,

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.660
it sounds like the whistle of a tea kettle in the distance.

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:32.010
At which point, she says,

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:33.410
ALLURA: "Ah! Allow me."

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:34.440
MATT: And she begins to walk over.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.770
She lifts her hand and you see a small drift

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:39.070
of arcane energy as her mage hand goes and lifts,

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:40.880
takes the water off of it's burner,

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:45.380
and begins to absent mindedly mage-hand various teacups

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.220
out of a large cabinet above the little kitchenette area.

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:49.660
ASHLEY: That's awesome.

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.000
(all laugh)

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:54.920
MATT: At which point, everyone's looking around,

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.330
Kima, amongst the rest of you guys, says,

00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:00.300
KIMA: "It's been awhile since I've been here.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:01.520
"Everything's as grandiose

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:05.260
"and unnecessarily dressed as it always is.

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.020
"I'm glad you got rid of that old rug though."

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:08.860
LAURA: (laughs)

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:12.220
(scattered coughing)

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:12.990
VAX: Sorry.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:14.280
LIAM: (coughs)

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.600
PIKE: Was there a rug?

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:16.240
VAX: I'm fine.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.290
PERCY: I don't remember that.

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:18.670
KEYLETH: Stay cool. Come on.

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:19.340
GROG: This rug?

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:19.770
VEX: Nope.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:20.330
PERCY: Nope.

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:20.810
PIKE: Nope.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:22.370
PERCY: Not here.

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.830
MATT: Allura, who is now in the process of pulling chairs over

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:26.460
and setting up a small sitting arrangement,

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.560
a semi-circle, and says,

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:28.890
KEYLETH: Itâ€™s so cute.

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:31.620
ALLURA: "The last time the tower collapsed

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:36.290
"and I was so rudely assaulted in my living quarters,

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:39.390
"it appears my rug went missing. It's all right.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:41.390
"I've kept my eye out for a new one for some time."

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.260
TIBERIUS: That was unfortunate.

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:46.570
VAX: Magic, it's tricky.

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:49.470
TIBERIUS: I had no idea. I jumped out when that happened.

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:51.550
PERCY: Speaking of tricky magic.

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:55.620
MATT: She gives a slow, knowing look about the group.

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:59.630
And gives a nod like, 'I acquiesce to this, that's fine'.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:04.180
KEYLETH: You should have some potted plants, Allura.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.200
Like some nice greenery.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.200
PERCY: You're going to try and feng shui the tower,

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:10.680
is that what you--

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:11.800
KEYLETH: Well, why not.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.130
PERCY: I don't know.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.930
ALLURA: "That's not a bad idea. Perhaps we'll discuss this."

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:17.840
VAX: This is silly.

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.280
VAX: Allura, it's a long story. Lot of deurgar,

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.860
lot of mindflayer, lot of mindflayers, and an evil god?

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:26.760
PERCY: A beholder.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.760
TIBERIUS: Yes, moreover, a beholder.

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:31.930
VAX: Yes, but who was pulling the strings behind the beholder.

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:33.930
KEYLETH: He thought he was an evil god.

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:35.930
A beholder with a god complex?

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:37.870
ALLURA: "Curious."

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:39.090
MATT: At which point, as you say that,

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:40.280
she does this with her fingers,

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.140
and all the chairs rush in underneath you guys.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.140
And you're put into a sitting position.

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:47.720
As you all sit, she begins to slowly mage-hand over

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.020
each one of you a freshly poured cup of tea.

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:53.210
MATT: A look of concern comes across her face.

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:57.860
ALLURA: "So you found your way beneath the city,

00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:01.560
"I assume based on the denizens you've mentioned,

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.370
"into the underdark proper.

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:05.940
"A beholder you say?

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.040
"Mindflayers you say?"

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:07.610
PERCY: Yes.

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.810
ALLURA: "I first off must apologize, I was not aware

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:12.830
"I was putting you into such dangerous territory."

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:14.590
TIBERIUS: Ha!

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:16.010
It was really dangerous!

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:19.070
It was nothing, filled with just buttholes everywhere.

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:19.940
Terrible.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.580
ALLURA: "That sounds like a terrible city."

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:22.430
TIBERIUS: Mhm..

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:23.980
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:27.440
ALLURA: "Well, first and foremost, I apologize for that.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.340
"I am incredibly grateful you're all

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.190
"seemingly healthy and still here.

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.080
"And you've brought Kima back to us which is very important."

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.000
ALLURA: "Well, I guess this is in order."

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.390
MATT: And she sits up for a second and walks over.

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:44.090
And you can see she looks back at the rest of you and

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:46.650
brushes her hand for a second.

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.730
A sphere of darkness appears in the corner of the room

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:50.890
where you can not see an entire part of the room.

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:52.650
And she sits there and hovers.

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.450
Just a little pocket of darkness.

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:55.320
MARISHA: Aw, man.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.340
PIKE: What's that?

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:56.980
MATT: You hear some rustling.

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.660
KEYLETH: We've been in darkness so long.
MATT: You hear some rustling.

00:44:58.660 --> 00:44:59.930
MATT: You hear some rustling.

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:01.240
MATT: The sphere of darkness finishes

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.180
and you see she's holding a sack of coins,

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.890
that you don't know where she picked them up from.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:05.630
KEYLETH: Oh!

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:08.080
MATT: She steps back over to her chair, sits down, and says,

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:09.790
ALLURA: "Just a precaution,

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:11.930
"I like to keep my private things private.

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.790
"But, a deal is a deal and you've done as you've asked.

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:19.520
"So as we've discussed, 10,000 gold pieces,

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.120
"to the lot of you, and my greatest thanks."

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:22.450
LAURA: I take that.
"to the lot of you, and my greatest thanks."

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:24.540
(all laugh)

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:27.180
MATT: She hands it out to Vex's eager palm.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.350
It's very heavy.

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.340
LAURA: Good thing I'm strong then, huh?

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:35.970
MATT: With her 9 strength, it sags.

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:38.110
LAURA: Sorry about the hand gesture there, stop it.

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:39.600
(all laugh)

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.690
MATT: Internet.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:43.570
MATT: She sits back down, says,

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.440
ALLURA: "You tell me what else if anything has transpired,

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.440
"and I'll let you know what you've missed."

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.590
PIKE: Well.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:59.020
TIBERIUS: We have Orcus's horn. So that's a thing.

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:06.420
MATT: There's a slight pause before the actual sound of

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:07.810
breaking glass hits your ears

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:09.970
as the teacup that she's holding

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:12.270
shatters across the stonework on the floor.

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:16.460
MATT: Allura, still sitting in her chair,

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:17.740
hands in place and says

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:20.500
ALLURA: "I'm sorry, what did you say?"

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.000
TIBERIUS: Yes, that beholder butthole that we had to fight,

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.160
that we had no idea we had to fight,

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.880
had this Orcus horn on his head.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.350
So we took it off and we kept it safe.

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:30.400
That's what you wanted I'm assuming, to destroy it.

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.900
VEX: But we haven't touched it though.

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:33.240
TIBERIUS: No.

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:35.180
ALLURA: "All right."

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:36.360
MATT: She looks over to Kima,

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.860
who does this with her shoulders up.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.780
Kima gives her a nod and says,

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:41.800
KIMA: "To be honest,

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.730
"I wasn't sure that was the end of my journey.

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:46.880
"But it seems that great evil I talked about before,

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.380
"we killed it and took its source of power.

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.780
"Now we're figuring out what to do with it."

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:54.510
MATT: She gives a sheepish grin and a slight shrug in her armor.

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:57.860
Allura looks to the ground for a moment and says,

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:02.170
ALLURA: "I don't know much of this object you say,

00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:05.810
"but if it was the source of the creature's power,

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:08.180
"and it carries with it the connotations of Orcus,

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:11.710
"then this is a very, very ill omen indeed."

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:13.230
TIBERIUS: Yes.

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:16.500
ALLURA: "This must be brought before the council immediately."

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:16.960
TIBERIUS: Wait.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.560
KEYLETH: The council?

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.500
TIBERIUS: The council?

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.840
ALLURA: "The council of Tal'Dorei, the council you are part of."

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:23.480
TIBERIUS: That helps.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.540
PIKE: Are you going there, right now, also?

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:27.050
ALLURA: "Yes, I was summoned to it."

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.400
PIKE: We were as well.
TIBERIUS: Here's the thing.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.900
TIBERIUS: Sorry, Pike.

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.780
The thing with this particular item is,

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:35.610
the more people know about it,

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:37.610
the more dangerous it actually becomes.

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:39.780
The fact that we even share this information with Kima

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.400
and with you is a very dangerous thing to begin with.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.140
ALLURA: "I agree."

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:46.330
TIBERIUS: Are the council trustworthy?

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:49.000
ALLURA: "Those who currently reside on the council are trustworthy,

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:49.900
"I assure you this.

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.650
"I've done my work with them for many years,

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:54.210
"and those that have passed have been replaced

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:56.030
"with equally trustworthy individuals.

00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:57.630
"And, rest assured,

00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:00.000
"I have my checks and balances in place as well."

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:03.100
VAX: I think what we're worried about most is

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:06.370
the corrupting nature of this thing.

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:10.990
And while the council may have good intentions,

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.890
I think more than a few of us are somewhat nervous.

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:18.340
What effect it might have on them, on us.

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:20.560
ALLURA: "Can you assess what the mistrust would be

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.410
"to not bring this before the sovereign and the council?"

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:27.850
TIBERIUS: Namely, if the immediate want is

00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:30.480
for it to be immediately destroyed,

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.250
because that's what needs to happen with

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:34.720
anything from Orcus, as you very well know.

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.480
ALLURA: "I understand,

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.330
"and I don't think you'll find anyone who disagrees.

00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:40.120
"But I also don't think you should sow mistrust with the council

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.760
"by keeping any of this information from them."

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.950
KEYLETH: It's not about trust.

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:46.980
VEX: Uriel has been corrupted once already.

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:47.630
KEYLETH: Exactly.

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:49.450
ALLURA: "This is true, and was it not by your hand

00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:51.290
"that he was freed and his family kept safe?

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:53.480
"Understand, that this is a man that

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.070
"owes you him and his family's life.

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:57.070
"I think he would take in to you,

00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:59.660
"his ear bent in your direction quite strongly."

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:01.880
KEYLETH: Correct, but couldn't you also safely say

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:05.090
that he is therefore fairly easy corruptible?

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:08.860
If he had been corrupted before, even not if subconsciously,

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:11.530
I'm not saying intentionally, but he clearly...

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:12.810
ALLURA: "You would know best

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:14.650
"what was responsible for corrupting our sovereign,

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:17.490
"as you did fight and one was felled,

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:18.880
"by it's own strength."

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.210
KEYLETH: I'm saying Lady Allura, that there is

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:27.220
essences, there seems to be magical properties to this horn

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:31.480
that corrupt even some of the strongest willed individuals.

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.800
ALLURA: "Then we must be rid of it quickly.

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:41.580
"And I think we need to at least discuss this

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:43.400
"with the council, if not present it.

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:46.430
"Bring it to their attention.

00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:49.770
"There are ways, arcane...

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:55.410
"not very approved ways,

00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:58.330
"of nullifying targeted memories."

00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:01.900
"The rest of the arcana pentsafocal have banned

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:04.750
"the use of such magics but if we could have approval,

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:08.430
"understanding the safety concerns of this object

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:12.610
"from the council we could override the arcana pentsafocal

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.140
"and I could employ some of these magics to make sure that

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:17.210
"once this artifact is destroyed

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:19.440
"or taken somewhere to never be found again,

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:22.540
"we ourselves perhaps would not recall it ever existed.

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:25.520
"And that itself is the safest course of action."

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.240
TIBERIUS: I agree.

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:31.790
VAX: I think that we trust you.

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:34.920
And you trust the council. That's enough for me.

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.160
PERCY: That's enough for me as well.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.120
KEYLETH: Pike? Where do you stand.

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.050
TIBERIUS: That's definitely enough for me.
KEYLETH: Pike? Where do you stand.

00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:40.590
TIBERIUS: Just so you know Allura --

00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:42.860
TIBERIUS: I might have

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:45.170
a solution as well for actually destroying it,

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:47.170
so I will follow your lead.

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:49.680
PERCY: I think the best course of action is to trust people.

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:53.150
VAX: And we're incapable of destroying the thing on our own.

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:55.150
TIBERIUS: Oh, that's not true at all.

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:57.690
I might have a solution which I just shared with Allura.

00:50:57.690 --> 00:50:59.690
I'm letting her take the lead on this,

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:01.890
and when the situation presents itself

00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:04.140
I might have a solution to destroy it outright.

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.810
VEX: Why don't you share that with us now Tiberius,

00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:06.940
instead of keeping it secret?

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:08.810
VAX: Just give us a rough sketch, maybe?
instead of keeping it secret?

00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:10.220
TIBERIUS: Very well.

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:12.000
ORION: I'll pull out my bag of holding.

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:13.720
TIBERIUS: This.

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.140
KEYLETH: The mending wheel?

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:17.850
TIBERIUS: No, the bag.

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:20.110
LAURA: An empty fist?

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:21.280
LIAM: He pulled out the bag.

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:25.600
KEYLETH: Okay. Would you care to elaborate, Tiberius?

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.050
TIBERIUS: I'm sorry.

00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:30.880
This part of the thing I wanted to tell all of you at breakfast.

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:36.800
The idea is, with some research

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.840
I've come to find that if anything is in a bag of holding,

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.840
and the bag of holding itself is destroyed,

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:45.370
the items or whatever go into a somewhat void,

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:48.370
that cannot be retrieved by any one particular thing.

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:51.650
If we are to have our memories erased, as you say,

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:55.000
then it would guarantee that when we place the

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.460
thing in a bag of holding and destroy that bag,

00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:59.980
it will then be dissipated into that void.

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:03.260
MATT: At which point, Allura raises her hand and says,

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:06.940
ALLURA: "Tiberius. You, as a very trained sorcerer,

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:09.230
"have some knowledge in this regard.

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:12.300
"I've been crafting bags of holding since I was a child

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:14.350
"as a way of keeping my weekends busy.

00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:18.060
"I have to notify you that should such a pocket of

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:21.080
"interdimensional arcane space is disrupted in this way,

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.560
"it doesn't send it into a void.

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:25.260
"It jettisons the contents into the Astral Sea.

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:28.650
"The Astral Sea which has many denizens

00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:30.290
"that could come across this object.

00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:32.660
"Githyanki themselves and their great ships."

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:33.940
TIBERIUS: I hate yankees.

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:36.460
ALLURA: "Gith --nevermind."

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:37.900
PIKE: So it could be bad.

00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:38.750
TIBERIUS: There are things --

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:41.930
ALLURA: "There are many things that exist in the Astral Sea

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:43.180
"that could recover this item.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.850
"I'm not saying there isn't merit to this, but I think

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:48.560
"it would be best we put it somewhere

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:51.660
"where at least we know for certain no one will find it,

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:54.340
"as opposed to just hoping it disappears somewhere."

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:56.020
TIBERIUS: But the memory thing is crucial.

00:52:57.150 --> 00:53:00.920
KEYLETH: What about those who might be uncomfortable with

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.690
toying around with my memories

00:53:03.690 --> 00:53:05.730
and tramping along around in my head,

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:07.880
I don't really want --

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.720
VAX: Why don't you think about it for a while?

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:13.560
GROG: My head's pretty fragile as it is.

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:17.060
VAX: We're talking about erasing the path back to this thing,

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:18.850
we're not talking about removing your

00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:22.510
adolescent years from your memory. Just this one thing.

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:24.510
GROG: All right.

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:28.010
KEYLETH: How many lessons have we learned in just the time.

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:31.530
Wouldn't we have to erase all memories surrounding it?

00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:33.710
We wouldn't even remember our trip into the underdark?

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:35.740
PERCY: I think we could perhaps just erase

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:37.230
the memory of where we put it.

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:40.410
TIBERIUS: That is what I assume will happen.

00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:42.410
ALLURA: "That is possible.

00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:44.410
"Like I've said, these magics have not been tampered with

00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:45.720
"in nearly 200 years."

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:48.900
KEYLETH: So we're gonna break the seal on some

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:51.640
untampered-with magics and just experiment.

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:57.680
ALLURA: "I am part of a group that oversees civilization.

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.450
"I can't go into too much detail

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:02.940
"but they are responsible for keeping such ancient magics,

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:04.820
"long forgotten magics such as this.

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:06.860
"I would have to

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.570
"meet with and discuss and gain approval for its use.

00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:13.280
"But for an item as dangerous as what you say,

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.610
"perhaps this is one of those special occasions."

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:18.090
LIAM: She's working for the Illuminati and we're basically

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:20.970
the A-team, so I think she might know a little better.

00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:21.940
TALIESIN: The A-team?

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:26.880
KEYLETH: What do you think, Pike?

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:31.060
PIKE: I feel like at this point

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.020
we don't really have another option.

00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:36.260
PIKE: And I do trust Allura.

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:37.400
TIBERIUS: I'm all tapped out.
PIKE: And I do trust Allura.

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:42.060
PIKE: So I feel like if we just

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:43.200
go check it out.

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:47.600
I don't really know what our other option is.

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:50.040
PIKE: That was a good one.

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.500
VAX: And if we don't like it we can step.

00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:54.840
PERCY: And if we don't like it

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.100
we can keep thinking of something else.

00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:58.280
We have time.

00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:01.210
ALLURA: "This is true. And who knows what wisdom

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:03.540
"the rest of the council might have in their midst as well.

00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:07.440
ALLURA: "They have members from all across the world.

00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:10.860
"We'll see which resources they have at their disposal."

00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:12.370
PERCY: I'm sure they're waiting for us.

00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:15.790
ALLURA: "I am glad to be free of my usual business.

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:17.660
"Are you guys familiar with the Wilder Fens?"

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.620
VAX: Sorry? The Wilder Fens?

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.690
ALLURA: "The Wilder Fens?

"They're a bloody merchant guild.

KEYLETH: Who?

00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:01.290
TIBERIUS: Damn gypsies.

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:03.960
ALLURA: "The Cortian League."

00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:07.390
MARISHA: The Cortian League.

00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:10.090
ALLURA: "From Wildmount, the north."

00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:13.610
PERCY: We fought stitch monsters, that was mostly what we...

00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:17.370
it was guns and swords and...

00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:19.070

VAX: Yes, we have pressing matters.

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:45.060
We'll get to that later.

00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:54.330
MATT: As you guys make your way back down through the tower,

00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:56.050
you eventually venture through

00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:58.200
the castletop district in front of the palace.

00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:00.300
The guards stand there with their

00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:03.730
long, red, velvet cloaks and their brass breastplates.

00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:06.130
They recognize both Allura and you as you approach.

00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:10.080
They step aside, put their spears toward the steps,

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:13.070
and give you a grand entrance to the front of the palace.

00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:16.560
MATT: As you step up, the front doors open on their own

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:19.180
with a large heavy shaking of the wood.

00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:21.000
As the palace doors open,

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000
you are led into the central chambers

00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:26.740
of the main palace walkway which splits to the right and left,

00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:29.470
and then across leads into the main throne room.

00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:31.000
However, you guys are meeting in the council room

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.790
which is to the left. You've been there twice before.

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.350
MATT: So you're led over to the council chambers,

00:57:36.350 --> 00:57:38.670
which, as you enter the main circular room,

00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:42.670
you're brought into the nice hardwood floors,

00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:46.000
the dark forest green colored walls,

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.780
these long tapestries which recall various battles

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:53.300
of history and broad mountainous landscapes

00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:57.700
showing settlers making their way across dangerous terrain.

00:57:58.350 --> 00:58:01.340
You can see various weapons from different civilizations

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:03.340
that were brought up as gifts to Emon

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:04.640
that have been mounted on the walls

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:08.010
as presentory atmospheric decor.

00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:15.380
And in the central room, you can see what currently stands,

00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:19.690
the entirety of the Tal'Dorei council, in a hushed discussion.

00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:23.310
The council, of course, has at the center,

00:58:23.310 --> 00:58:24.460
across the table from you,

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:26.840
Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei the Second himself.

00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:29.060
The leader of Emon and the current Sovereign

00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:32.240
of all of Tal'Dorei, this section of the continent.

00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:36.400
You see him with his characteristic dark hair,

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:40.320
with greying sides, cut shorter than you recall.

00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:41.760
Looks like he recently got a trim

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:44.700
and some very well kept facial hair.

00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:46.700
He's wearing his ceremonial robes which are

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:49.930
the same gold and red color as the armored soldiers

00:58:49.930 --> 00:58:51.930
that greeted you at the front of the palace.

00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:54.210
Next to him, you see Lord Riskell Daxio,

00:58:54.210 --> 00:58:57.020
the elven male who helped you guys handle

00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:58.410
the purchasing of the keep

00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:01.200
when you were awarded that at the end of your last journey.

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:04.040
He's the Master of Trade currently within Emon.

00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:08.640
You can see he has long strawberry blonde hair

00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.270
that is pulled into a tight ponytail to the back.

00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:11.820
He wears darker clothing,

00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:14.900
more for decoration than actual use.

00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:17.340
His armor seems to be loose and more decorative.

00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:23.440
Next to him is Guardian Tofor Brotorus,

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:25.280
which you've heard of but have not met before.

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:27.410
A female dragonborn paladin.

00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:28.440
MARISHA: Say that one more time?

00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:29.690
Guardian who's a what now?

00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:31.930
MATT: Guardian Tofor Bratoras.

00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:33.080
MARISHA: To-for?

00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:34.320
MATT: T-O-F-O-R.

00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:37.290
Bratoras. Her name's been mentioned before but this is

00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:39.340
the first time you guys have actually seen her in person.

00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:40.220
ASHLEY: It's a girl?

00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:41.800
MATT: It's a female dragonborn paladin.

00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:47.600
She is adorned in full, silvered platinum plate.

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:51.100
That has currently carved multiple symbols of Bahamut,

00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:52.300
the Platinum Dragon.

00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:56.560
As she looks up and notices, you can see

00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:01.320
she gives a hand up, a symbol of greetings towards Kima.

01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:03.050
As Kima also gives her hand up

01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:04.570
and they both touch the front of their armor

01:00:04.570 --> 01:00:05.840
in a symbolic holy way,

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.140
they both being followers of Bahamut.

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:09.840
You immediately make that religious connection

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:10.660
between the two of them.

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:13.620
She looks across at the rest of the group there

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.380
that she doesn't seem to notice, eyes meeting with Tiberius.

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.030
This is strange.

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:20.290
You haven't seen very many dragonborn at all within Emon,

01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:22.840
and as soon as she meets your gaze,

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:26.640
she gives you a look of deep, deep stinkeye.

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:30.780
TIBERIUS: Hello. My name is Tiberius Stormwind.

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.780
Of House Stormwind, from Draconia.

01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:35.210
Tofor: "From Draconia, you say?"

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:37.850
TIBERIUS: Yes. I'm sure you've heard of

01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:40.580
my father Kravanas, my mother Penelope?

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:42.460
Tofor: "And perhaps you should close that trap

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:45.260
and sit across the table as far from me as possible. "

01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:48.350
MATT: She seems to spit the words almost,

01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:49.740
and sits back in her chair.

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.550
TIBERIUS: Mind your tongue.

01:00:53.790 --> 01:00:56.460
MATT: The rest of the council's talking amongst themselves

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:58.190
and hearing this slight discussion.

01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:02.290
Next to her there is a halfling male, in a ranger-ish garb,

01:01:02.290 --> 01:01:05.980
wearing what looks like some really fine chain shirt,

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:08.600
with a thick dark black cloak.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.810
He is shaved bald with tattoos on one side of his face,

01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:14.020
and he introduces himself.

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.830
MALE: "I'm terribly, sorry. I did not mean

01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:19.980
"for there to be any sort of misunderstanding here."

01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:22.990
MATT: He gives a slight nudge to Tofor.

01:01:22.990 --> 01:01:25.290
MALE: "I do not believe we've met at this time.

01:01:25.290 --> 01:01:27.290
"My name is Seeker Asum Emring.

01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:29.490
"I am the master of secrets here within the council."

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:32.190
MATT: He extends his hand towards you,

01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:34.980
almost like alleviating the tension.

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:37.920
TIBERIUS: Hi. Stormwind here.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.610
Seeker Asum: "I assume you're the ones we're waiting for,

01:01:40.610 --> 01:01:41.230
"please have a seat."

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:43.890
MATT: At which the sovereign finishes discussion with

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:45.480
another human which you have not met.

01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:48.340
He is a built and armored individual,

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:51.040
stands probably the tallest of the entire group,

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.860
thick square jaw, unshaven.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.570
At which point he puts his hand

01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:58.050
on the sovereign's shoulder and says,

01:01:58.050 --> 01:02:00.940
MALE: "I suppose I should introduce myself as well.

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:03.410
"I've heard much about you, Vox Machina.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.060
"I am Arbiter Braum Goldhand.

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:10.380
"I have recently taken up as of three months ago

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:13.860
"the position that General Kreig once held within the city.

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:17.040
"Since he was unfortunately lost to us,

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:20.160
"there was a need for a new master of law.

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.160
"As since I've had a lot to keep up on.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:25.370
"Unable to meet you personally until now,

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:26.340
"but it is a pleasure.

01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:27.870
"I've heard nothing but great things."

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:30.740
MATT: He sits down in his chair.

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:32.750
Allura finds her

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.640
side of the table and gestures the rest of you.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.790
ALLURA: "Please, have a seat."

01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.980
TIBERIUS: I stand. I don't sit.

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:43.000
MATT: All right.

01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:45.660
MATT: The overeign finishes writing some papers,

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:49.390
rolls them up, snaps twice, and a gentleman comes by.

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:50.520
He hands him the papers and says,

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.260
URIEL TALDOREI: "Get this to Lady and Lord Briarwood

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:53.320
"as soon as possible, thank you."

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.090
URIEL: "All right.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.850
"First of all, I want to welcome you all back.

01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:03.380
"It's been a few weeks since we've seen each other.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:06.740
"I've been recently given word that you unceremoniously

01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.590
"appeared in the center of

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:13.580
"the Lyceum not but twelve hours ago,

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:14.490
"worse for wear.

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:17.820
"So I would like to know, first off,

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:21.480
"why you've returned in the center of our city.

01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:24.600
"And I want to see how you've all

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:27.740
"been these past few weeks.

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:29.070
"I apologize if I'm a bit scattered

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:31.560
"Iâ€™ve had a few things on my mind as of late.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.310
"But yes, how is Vox Machina."

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:35.680
VAX: If I may.

01:03:37.090 --> 01:03:39.490
We didn't choose to dump ourselves

01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:40.830
right in the middle of the city.

01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:44.850
That was born out of necessity, not out of choice.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:51.180
The task we set out to finish proved

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:55.680
a lot more complicated than originally perceived.

01:03:57.490 --> 01:04:00.830
Frankly, I worry about the safety of the city of Kraghammer.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.720
Underneath their home down in the bowels of the earth,

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.480
I'm don't know how much the council knows

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:11.480
about the race of the illithid.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.830
We stumbled into a veritable

01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:17.570
hornets' nest of them below the city.

01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:19.840
MATT: Most faces are blank.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:23.940
Allura has her hands on the table, listening intently.

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:27.210
As you say illithid, you do notice that Seeker Asum Emring,

01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:30.030
the halfling, immediately sits back in his chair

01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:31.980
with a look of 'oh, snap'.

01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:37.330
VAX: I see a lot of blank stares at this table.

01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:41.300
I wasn't very familiar with them either.

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:44.220
There is an entire city in the underdark

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:45.640
beneath Kraghammer.

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.130
And...

01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:53.330
... in their midst was a beholder

01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:55.800
that was controlling the entire city.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.470
We ended up destroying it,

01:04:57.470 --> 01:05:00.120
barely escaping with our lives.

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:05.380
Fleeing the city... destroying a god? I think.

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:07.160
VEX: I don't think we destroyed the god.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:10.300
TIBERIUS: The beholder is merely a demi-demon.

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:12.680
VEX: Yes, it was something he had possessed,

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.170
but the god still lives.

01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:20.000
LIAM: Yes, but Orcus was behind the beholder.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:24.430
MARISHA: We just have the horn.

01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:26.570
LIAM: We killed K'varn

01:05:26.570 --> 01:05:27.940
and then he got back up again.

01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:29.140
He didn't get himself back up.

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:31.760
KEYLETH: Because Orcus is a god of necromancy and undeath.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:32.840
ORION: That's what the horn did.

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.650
It brought him back to life when he would die.

01:05:34.650 --> 01:05:36.340
That's why I ripped it out when we did it

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:37.860
because I knew that's what was going on.

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:39.300
That's what the horn does.

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:44.640
LIAM: I just worry that it's not just an appliance.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:47.090
It's got hidden in it something --

01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:48.080
ORION: It absolutely has --

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.730
Remember, it laughed at me when I tried to crush it --

01:05:50.730 --> 01:05:51.980
LIAM: --is what I'm saying.

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.280
MATT: Allura looks at you strangely.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.780
ALLURA: "Tiberius, you sound different."

01:05:55.890 --> 01:05:57.230
ORION: I was talking to --

01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.890
MATT: I know.

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:04.680
VAX: Be that as it may we riled up a city of --

01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:06.750
PERCY: Mind flayers.

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.300
VAX: Buttholes as Tiberius would call them.

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:15.840
-- very unhappy race of things

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.380
below the surface of the earth.

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:20.530
Now, we're here today because Tiberius,

01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:23.550
crafty as he is, was able to flee ahead of us

01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:25.340
and create a portal back here.

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:28.600
We ended up falling ass over tea kettle

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.330
in the Lyceum, so here we are.

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.080
URIEL: "Well, welcome back."

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.040
VAX: Thank you.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.580
URIEL: "It's glad to see you're safe."

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:38.810
VAX: We've brought a little bit of the evil with us.

01:06:38.810 --> 01:06:40.460
MATT: At which point the table gets

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:42.680
extremely uncomfortable, suddenly.

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.770
As everyone steps back, Kima steps forward.

01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:46.410
She's kept to the back at this point, and says,

01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:48.830
KIMA: "It's all right.

01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:50.240
"I will speak for this group

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:55.560
"as you also know of their exploits and their abilities.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.290
"They saved me from what was probably

01:06:57.290 --> 01:06:59.570
"certain death and torture and aided me

01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:01.410
"in stopping what darkness was beneath Kraghammer.

01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:02.440
"At least what we could.

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:05.690
"But, listen to what they have to say

01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:08.500
"and understand they are as trustworthy as they come."

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.200
MATT: At which point the sovereign

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.170
lifts a hand up to her and says,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.570
URIEL: "Well Kima, your word is trusted

01:07:15.570 --> 01:07:19.720
"and I appreciate you also have returned to us healthy.

01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:22.650
"So. What is this evil you bring with you?"

01:07:25.570 --> 01:07:27.740
VAX: We have it stored safely away.

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:28.420
KEYLETH: Yes.

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.870
VAX: But this beholder...

01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:34.130
... was using an artifact, a horn.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.270
Emanating darkness and shit.

01:07:39.690 --> 01:07:42.610
And Tiberius, in the heat of the battle,

01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:44.610
ripped it from its pate.

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:47.470
And we brought it back with us.

01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:50.290
KEYLETH: It is one of the two horns of Orcus.

01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:53.490
MATT: At that notification, you say the name Orcus,

01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:55.770
and you can see there's a whole energy shift

01:07:55.770 --> 01:07:57.180
in the room at which point.

01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:02.410
A lot of furrowed brows drop to intense.

01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:05.580
The actual air of the room seems to go

01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:06.770
still for a moment.

01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:09.150
From what you can see,

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:14.910
Seeker Asum and Tofor both

01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:17.500
grit their teeth and lean forward as you say this.

01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:21.520
Tofor says,

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.820
Tofor: "You said Orcus?"

01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:25.050
PERCY: Yes.

01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:26.180
TIBERIUS: Are you deaf?

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:27.720
KEYLETH: Tiberius.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:28.750
PERCY: Manners.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.480
VAX: We see the apprehension written on your faces

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:36.190
and we are nervous as well.

01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:39.730
But the alternative was leaving the horn

01:08:39.730 --> 01:08:42.040
with these illithid.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:44.720
Hundreds if not thousands of illithid.

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:49.250
We had to make a judgement call rather quickly, and... 

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:51.950
... frankly leaving it there with them seemed

01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:53.300
like it wasn't an option.

01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:55.920
Tofor: "You've done right in bringing it here.

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.920
"This has to be destroyed.

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:00.960
"Sent as far away--

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.250
"If this is indeed an artifact of Orcus,

01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:05.980
"it cannot exist on this plane."

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.430
PERCY: Plans must be drawn up.

01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:11.560
KEYLETH: That's kind of what we thought.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.010
TIBERIUS: Yes we knew this already.

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.260
MATT: At which point Kima steps forward and says

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:19.080
KIMA: "Now, understand this is not something

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.900
"you can lock in a box, or put some guards around it.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.330
"There was a reason this was forgotten

01:09:25.330 --> 01:09:26.800
"and needs to be again.

01:09:29.650 --> 01:09:36.660
"With the proper surrounding strength and

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.840
"formidable individuals,

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:42.180
"I can take it to the grand chantry in Osthania

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:44.460
"where the High Paladin Archibald will reseal it.

01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:46.660
"Far away from the eyes and minds of the world.

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.360
"Lest we can come up with some sort of

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:50.650
"way to destroy this item."

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:56.030
MATT: At which point the Arbiter, Braum, steps forward.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.120
Arbiter Braum: "If you think there's possibly a way

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.270
"to destroy this, we need to discover this here.

01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:06.130
"We cannot allow it outside of the midst of this,

01:10:06.130 --> 01:10:08.850
"to some chaotic winds and whim of the world around us.

01:10:08.850 --> 01:10:11.420
"We have the walls of Emon to keep it safe.

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.860
"Why not take it to the Lyceum."

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:14.860
VAX: I want to make an insight check on the whole table.

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:16.110
TRAVIS: Dang.

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:20.140
TALIESIN: I want to also double-check,

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:22.350
who was it that handed off the letter to the Briarwoods?

01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:24.890
MATT: That was the sovereign.

01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:26.040
TALIESIN: Sovereign? Thank you.

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:32.610
MATT: So which individual, the Arbiter?

01:10:32.610 --> 01:10:33.470
LIAM: Yeah.

01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:34.850
MATT: Okay, Arbiter Braum. What'd you roll?

01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:35.810
LIAM: Just a ten.

01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:36.240
MATT: Ten?

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.570
ASHLEY: Can I insight the seeker?

01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:38.210
MATT: Sure.

01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:45.630
MATT: What's your insight roll?

01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:49.520
ASHLEY: Thirteen.

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.110
MATT: Thirteen? Okay.

01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:51.820
TALIESIN: I would like to insight the sovereign

01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:53.230
just because, reasons.

01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:56.290
PIKE: Yeah, we do.
TALIESIN: One.

01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:58.800
MATT: Starting the game off strong guys.

01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:03.980
LAURA: I think you need some Florida rolling.

01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:05.940
TALIESIN: I'm just an idiot thinking.
LAURA: I think you need some Florida rolling.

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:08.020
LIAM: Yeah, I think so too. You're awfully quiet.

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:09.890
LAURA: I'm going to insight check as well!

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.500
LAURA: Because Matt can totally whisper to me

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:13.690
if I get this good.

01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:15.230
LIAM: He'll text you.

01:11:15.230 --> 01:11:16.260
MATT: I'll text it to you.

01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:19.580
LIAM: Roll high.

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.380
LAURA: Hold on, I'm looking.

01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:22.620
TRAVIS: She's rolling.

01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:26.720
LAURA: Seventeen.

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:27.970
MATT: Eleventeen?

01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:29.260
TRAVIS: Seventeen!

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:30.060
LAURA: Seventeen!

01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:31.920
MATT: A total of 17?

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:32.840
LIAM: Eleventy-seven.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:33.530
LAURA: Yeah.

01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:34.510
MATT: On which individual?

01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:39.340
LIAM: Which person at the table, sis?

01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:41.000
LAURA: You.

01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:45.320
LIAM: Your brother?

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:49.300
LAURA: Oh no! On the deep voiced guy!

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:50.220
ASHLEY: The Arbiter.

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.310
MATT: Okay. Arbiter Braum.

01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:52.480
LAURA: Yes, the arbiter.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.940
(all laugh)

01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:54.510
MATT: Okay.

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:55.140
MARISHA: You!

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.510
LIAM: Why you gotta be like that, huh?

01:11:57.870 --> 01:12:01.210
MATT: I'll say in a general feel about the room,

01:12:01.210 --> 01:12:02.720
but the arbiter specifically,

01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:09.050
There is definitely a very quick rising in tension, fear,

01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:11.230
and adrenaline in the room at this conversation.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.880
Fear is the main thing you're getting.

01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:19.720
I wouldn't say that you sense any deception.

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:22.820
You just sense that the stakes have just suddenly jumped

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:24.910
from what they were expecting their morning to be.

01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:26.650
They're trying to wrap their head around it.

01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:33.130
So nothing too particular catches your shit radar.

01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:35.050
LAURA: All right.

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:37.310
GROG: We are not leaving the horn here.

01:12:39.010 --> 01:12:39.600
VEX: No..

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.230
PERCY: We would have to leave you here.

01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:44.090
MATT: As Grog speaks up for the Arbiter, he says,

01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:46.750
Arbiter Braum: "I'm not saying we leave it here.

01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:49.680
"I'm saying that while we have it here, we have it studied.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:50.750
"Bring it to the Lyceum.

01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:52.680
"The headmaster and his entire research facility

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.040
"could possibly find a way to destroy it.

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:59.700
"There is no finer arcane focus

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:01.160
"than that lyceum in the city.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:05.130
"They're responsible for the construction of our sky ships.

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.900
"And the crystals that keep them elevated."

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:09.320
TIBERIUS: I love skyships.

01:13:10.730 --> 01:13:13.000
VEX: I believe the power would be too great.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.100
It will corrupt.

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:17.090
People will want to take it for  themselves.

01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:20.180
Arbiter Braum: "Then it has to be taken elsewhere and sealed.

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:21.610
"Like Kima was requesting."

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.220
KEYLETH: So you're saying essentially our two options are

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:26.440
we can either keep it here and study it to try

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.070
and figure out a way to destroy it

01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:32.830
and have all of the risks of this horn being inside the city

01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:36.530
or we take the other massive risks of

01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:38.560
trying to ship it off somewhere

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:40.210
and hope that it gets sealed away?

01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:42.770
MATT: At which point, Tofor the female dragonborn

01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:44.400
sits up in her chair and says,

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.010
Tofor: "Regardless. It should not stay here in my opinion.

01:13:48.650 --> 01:13:50.990
"Understand the longer it resides within Emon,

01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:52.590
"the more word will spread.

01:13:53.050 --> 01:13:56.190
"And more despots will be drawn to our city to claim it.

01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:58.910
"Do you wish to have all the darkness of this land

01:13:58.910 --> 01:14:00.580
"slowly swarm in on the city?"

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:03.370
VAX: I think we're of a like mind.

01:14:03.370 --> 01:14:03.930
TIBERIUS: Yes.

01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:05.500
VAX: I think we should take it from the city.

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.960
KEYLETH: I think it's a giant target on our backs right now.

01:14:09.230 --> 01:14:10.690
ORION: I turn to the Arbiter.

01:14:10.690 --> 01:14:12.690
TIBERIUS: There is something that you should know.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.330
During our battle with K'varn,

01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:17.700
which was the name of the beholder,

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:20.730
which the horn resided upon its head.

01:14:20.730 --> 01:14:22.180
When I ripped it from its head,

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:24.650
I held it in the telekinesis state.

01:14:24.650 --> 01:14:28.960
I attempted to crush it for not knowing what it was at first.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:32.120
Just knowing it was bringing creatures back to life.

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:36.610
When I attempted to do so, I heard

01:14:36.610 --> 01:14:40.920
somewhat of a laughter in the back of my mind.

01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:47.870
I fear whatever this is attached to might be aware,

01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:51.160
or if anything, more aware than it was previously.

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:54.430
I'm not sure if it was alerted by being placed

01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:55.980
on the beholder's head to begin with,

01:14:57.010 --> 01:15:00.500
but I heard something.

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:04.300
ORION: Looking at Tofor.

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:05.770
TIBERIUS: I agree with the peasant.

01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:08.610
That we should get it out of here immediately.

01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:12.700
MATT: At which point the sovereign

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.350
who's been kinda quiet this moment, says,

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:19.470
URIEL: "Well. Best I can tell at this point,

01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:20.990
"it should not stay in Emon.

01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:22.460
"We've had enough trouble in this city

01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:25.160
"and enough issues here that we're having to deal with

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:28.010
"in the aftermath of the attack on my family.

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:34.010
"We do not have the mental will nor the ability

01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:36.210
"to withstand any sort of assault either from

01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:37.820
"the inside or the outside of the city.

01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:40.750
"If we are to take it elsewhere

01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:45.650
"I trust the opinion of you, of Kima, and Allura."

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.320
MATT: At which point Allura takes a moment and says,

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.710
ALLURA: "Just the knowledge of such a thing existing,

01:15:51.710 --> 01:15:54.660
"let alone two, in this world is dangerous.

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:58.330
"Who knows what horrors an individual could achieve

01:15:58.330 --> 01:15:59.980
"should they find both horns.

01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:04.080
"Now, wherever this gets taken,

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:07.360
"the knowledge that all of us know that these exist now,

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:10.660
"and anyone else beyond this, means that that's a leak.

01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:13.250
"That's a weakness.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.960
"Now I've heard of some magics

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:18.670
"that can erase selective memories permanently.

01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:20.270
"Ancient magics."

01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:21.940
MATT: At which point as she starts saying this,

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:23.550
the rest of the room shifts uncomfortably.

01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:25.490
You can see Tofor begins to raise her hand to protest.

01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:27.150
Allura shuts her down and says,

01:16:27.150 --> 01:16:29.680
ALLURA: "But, I'd not employ these

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.550
"unless they were absolutely necessary.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:36.520
"I need to speak with the Arcana Pentsafocal

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.340
"and see if this is

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:41.060
"such a strange and necessary circumstance

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:43.630
"to allow the use of such magics.

01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:44.600
"That will take me some time

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:45.930
"to get the entire conclave to agree,

01:16:45.930 --> 01:16:47.370
"but I think it's possible.

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.340
"It may be the only way, if we can not destroy this,

01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:51.340
"to make sure that the rest of this

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.340
"world never knows that it existed.

01:16:54.490 --> 01:16:56.240
"I think that's the safest route.

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.860
"As for getting it out of the city

01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:01.370
"I feel that we have two individuals here,

01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:02.860
"two followers of Bahamut,

01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:05.120
"both the deity that saw the deity,

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.840
"brought the vision to Kima,

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:10.080
"and presented, whether in a roundabout way,

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.290
"the power and strength of these individuals

01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:13.760
"to eventually retrieve it

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:16.010
"and prevent it from being an artifact that

01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:17.760
"instrumentally destroyed the dwarven city

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.390
"and quite possibly all of Tal'Dorei.

01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:23.070
"So I think if there was a god whose guidance

01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:24.140
"we can look into,

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:27.770
"I would put my trust in the clergy of Bahamut."

01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:31.010
MATT: She looks to Kima. Kima nods her head.

01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:34.440
TIBERIUS: Of course we'd agree with such sentiments as well.

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:41.050
MATT: Kima raises her maul and says,

01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:44.700
KIMA: Well then, if that's to be the case,

01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:47.140
"I'll send word over to the rest of my temple.

01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:49.570
"We'll send over our finest paladins,

01:17:49.570 --> 01:17:51.470
"clerics, and guardians.

01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:54.130
"Prepare a box for travel. We'll take it across the sea.

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:56.700
"Then we shall seal this bastard."

01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:57.320
TIBERIUS: Kima.

01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.530
GROG: Yeah! Oh. Sorry.

01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:01.650
(all laugh)

01:18:01.650 --> 01:18:05.100
TIBERIUS: Kima, when you do approach your king,

01:18:06.510 --> 01:18:13.300
propose because Orcus's horn is pure black evil,

01:18:13.710 --> 01:18:16.370
perhaps the side of light can help as well.

01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:19.650
The blessing of Sarenrae and other light sources,

01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:22.060
divine powers, could be helpful as well.

01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:23.260
KIMA: "The horn will remain here

01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:25.210
"until the vessel is brought over.

01:18:25.210 --> 01:18:28.120
"But we have holy vessels specifically designed for the

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:31.640
"keeping of remains or things that are of great evil.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.700
"We would gladly welcome the blessing

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:35.570
"of something from Sarenrae as well.

01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:38.280
"After all, there is nothing wrong with more positive energy

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.730
"instilled to maintain such a negative force."

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:44.350
KEYLETH: I personally don't trust this horn

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:48.810
travelling anywhere without at least one of our supervision.

01:18:48.810 --> 01:18:50.660
MATT: At which point the sovereign speaks up and says,

01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:54.250
URIEL: "And to be completely honest,

01:18:54.850 --> 01:18:57.600
"we are very grateful you've brought the horn here.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.130
"But you are a motley crew.

01:18:59.810 --> 01:19:01.980
"Who is to say any of you

01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:04.970
"are also immune to this corruption as well?

01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:08.500
"Who's to say you eight

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:11.210
"carry the mental willpower to withstand this darkness

01:19:11.210 --> 01:19:13.980
"any better than a group of paladins designed and trained

01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:16.610
"their entire lives to withstand and destroy this evil.

01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:21.540
"What assurance do I have that your

01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:24.210
"attachment to nature will not become some dark,

01:19:24.210 --> 01:19:28.360
"brambled, twisted, thing in the proximity of this artifact?

01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:30.570
"None.

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:32.970
"Just keep that in mind."

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:35.390
ORION: I look to the group and do this to Scanlan.

01:19:36.850 --> 01:19:38.210
(all laugh)

01:19:38.210 --> 01:19:40.520
TALIESIN: Taking quite advantage of his current state of mind.

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.930
ORION: You have no idea what I'm going to do

01:19:41.930 --> 01:19:43.360
for the rest of this game.

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:44.930
TRAVIS: You literally do that to Scanlan.

01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:46.700
Like you... to Scanlan?

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:48.800
ORION: No, I was pointing at him.

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:49.740
LIAM: Right in the ear.

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.320
MATT: Wet willy. To our little gnome bard.

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.310
ORION: (laughs)

01:19:53.310 --> 01:19:54.540
MATT: We miss you Sam.

01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:57.330
MATT: Uriel looks around.

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.000
URIEL: "Well, given the circumstance

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.050
"I would say that our best bet now is to

01:20:02.050 --> 01:20:06.300
"have Kima and Tofor reach out to the grand chambers of Bahamut.

01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:10.560
"Have them bring a vessel and seal it somewhere

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:15.960
"that they find fit for an object of this dark presence.

01:20:16.930 --> 01:20:18.690
"Is the council in agreement of this?

01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:23.620
"Unless some other, better means arises.

01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:25.620
"How long will it take for this vessel to arrive?"

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:28.300
MATT: At which point, Kima scratches her chin for a second.

01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:31.260
KIMA: "By the fastest ships,

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.520
"especially if we're using some of your fancy sky dinghies.

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:38.100
"I can't imagine more than two weeks?"

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:39.810
KEYLETH: Two weeks?!

01:20:39.810 --> 01:20:41.450
MATT: At which point --

01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:43.950
TIBERIUS: That's 14 days, your highness.

01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:44.840
KEYLETH: (sighs)

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:45.880
VEX: That was adorable.

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:46.910
PIKE: A fortnight?

01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:50.650
MATT: At which point Allura stands forward and says,

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:53.650
ALLURA: "It's in the means of --"

01:20:53.650 --> 01:20:56.270
KEYLETH: You guys don't have any holy ships here.

01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:58.880
You don't have like a ship dock?

01:20:58.880 --> 01:20:59.870
TIBERIUS: I'm sure if they did

01:20:59.870 --> 01:21:01.450
they would probably use that one.

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:03.980
TALIESIN: But I'm using it.

01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:07.570
(all laugh)

01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:17.080
MATT: At this point Allura

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.920
sits forward and to the rest of the group, says,

01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:23.540
ALLURA: "To be fair Kima, in my experience and knowledge,

01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:25.620
"ships function well for the movement

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.220
"of goods and large objects.

01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:31.580
"The speed of this requires some expediting and

01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:34.580
"I happen to have a friend who is over in Osthania,

01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:36.750
"probably not far from your clergy.

01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:42.100
"Perhaps we can facilitate a two-day travel?"

01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:44.320
MATT: At which point the group leans back

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:45.580
for a second and Kima goes,

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:48.740
KIMA: "Well fine. Yeah, I guess."

01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:50.740
MATT: Shoots a dirty look a little bit to --

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:53.050
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check on Allura really quick?

01:21:53.050 --> 01:21:53.860
MATT: Sure.

01:21:57.330 --> 01:21:59.370
LIAM: She's saying a ship will be ready in two days

01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:01.280
or take two days to travel?

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.240
MATT: Allura's saying,

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.760
ALLURA: "Depending on the size of this vessel,

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:04.720
"why do we even need a ship?

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:08.250
"We have the ability to transport between the cities.

01:22:08.250 --> 01:22:10.490
"If we can pool our resources,

01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:11.700
"there's no reason why we can't

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:13.620
"bring them here nearly instantaneously."

01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:14.650
MARISHA: Thirteen.

01:22:14.650 --> 01:22:15.310
MATT: Thirteen?

01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:18.620
Best you can tell, Allura's really hard to read.

01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:19.450
She keeps up her smile

01:22:19.450 --> 01:22:21.240
but she definitely has her intense face on.

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:22.380
She's deep in the moment.

01:22:23.690 --> 01:22:25.520
No real gives one way or the other.

01:22:27.930 --> 01:22:30.450
The rest of the group looks around

01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:32.850
and Arcanist in the silence goes,

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:35.330
ALLURA: "Well then, I think that

01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:37.250
"me and Kima and Tofor, if you'd like,

01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:43.230
"we can designate a way of bringing this relic container

01:22:43.230 --> 01:22:45.310
"as fast as possible so we can get this going.

01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:48.400
"I wish not to keep this within our presence much longer.

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.460
"Do we agree to that?"

01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:51.040
TIBERIUS: Yes.

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:51.650
PERCY: Yes.

01:22:51.650 --> 01:22:54.770
VAX: I think we would feel comfortable

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:56.410
going along for the ride

01:22:56.410 --> 01:22:58.410
and seeing this thing through to the end.

01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:01.980
MATT: She glances over to the sovereign.

01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:04.420
The sovereign nods.

01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:07.040
URIEL: "Very well. Very well, I'll allow it.

01:23:07.710 --> 01:23:10.360
"I may have some business for you coming soon

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.650
"so try not to be gone too long.

01:23:12.650 --> 01:23:16.240
"Although this is much more important business, I do agree."

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.530
MATT: Then he gives a laugh and smile

01:23:17.530 --> 01:23:18.530
to raise a bit of levity in the room

01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:20.360
that nobody seems to respond to.

01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:24.210
URIEL: "But nevertheless

01:23:24.210 --> 01:23:26.210
"if you wish to travel and see this through

01:23:26.210 --> 01:23:27.980
"I don't see there would be any complaint."

01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:29.440
MATT: He looks to Lady Kima and Kima says,

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:30.800
KIMA: "No, not at all.

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.800
"We've gotten along swimmingly so far.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:33.580
"Mostly.

01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:36.910
"Very well.

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:41.090
"I'm bad at this political stuff."

01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:42.540
MATT: Kima steps back a little bit,

01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:43.980
Kima: "I defer to the rest of you."

01:23:44.370 --> 01:23:47.890
MATT: Puts her maul on the ground and awkwardly looks away.

01:23:47.890 --> 01:23:48.540
The sovereign goes,

01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:50.600
URIEL: "Very well. It is settled.

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:52.730
"Reach out to your clergy. Bring the vessel.

01:23:52.730 --> 01:23:54.610
"Allura, facilitate its arrival.

01:23:54.610 --> 01:23:56.780
"We will get this artifact as far away from Emon as possible.

01:23:58.980 --> 01:23:59.820
"This is adjourned.

01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:01.820
"Thank you all very much for coming to this council meeting."

01:24:03.630 --> 01:24:04.410
KEYLETH: Okay.

01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:07.680
TALIESIN: I'm going to catch the sovereign on his way out.

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:09.100
MATT: All right.

01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:12.060
At which point everyone gathers the rest of their papers,

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:13.760
their parchments, they're rolling up scrolls.

01:24:14.490 --> 01:24:17.810
The Arbiter gets up and lumbers his way out of the room.

01:24:17.810 --> 01:24:19.640
The seeker, Asum, steps up to the rest of you

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:20.900
with a final handshake.

01:24:21.330 --> 01:24:23.150
SEEKER ASUM: "A pleasure to meet you all, once again,

01:24:23.150 --> 01:24:25.820
"I've heard so much. You're doing fine work."

01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:33.460
MATT: He seems strangely nervous. But in a weird way,

01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:34.940
he's a gentle hint of fanboy.

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:36.940
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:38.020
LAURA: I wink at him.

01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:39.370
(all laugh)

01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:42.050
MATT: He slyly winks back on his way out.

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:47.020
MATT: As he exits, Tofor stands up.

01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:48.800
You've only seen her sitting since you arrived.

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:51.050
As Tofor stands in her female dragonborn form,

01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:54.570
she is probably a good solid foot taller than Tiberius.

01:24:54.570 --> 01:24:59.380
And is a thick musclebound dragonborn paladin of Bahamut.

01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:01.840
Her armor shifts as she stands,

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.000
she begins to make her way towards the door,

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.540
not even with a glance in your direction.

01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:07.140
ORION: That means she's as tall as you, Grog.

01:25:08.370 --> 01:25:09.140
TRAVIS: What?

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:11.080
ORION: She's as tall as you.

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:14.210
MARISHA: I just whisper to Tiberius and say,

01:25:14.210 --> 01:25:18.190
KEYLETH: Are all the ladies that big in Draconia?

01:25:18.190 --> 01:25:21.460
TIBERIUS: It all depends. Not really.

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:22.540
MATT: She's bigger than usual.

01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:25.330
TIBERIUS: She's a wretched peasant so I can not.

01:25:25.330 --> 01:25:26.590
KEYLETH: That's so mean.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.040
VAX: That's a little harsh.

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:30.370
MATT: Allura stands up and begins to leave.

01:25:30.370 --> 01:25:32.170
The sovereign stands up and as he stands up

01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:34.100
the guards come out and they come to his side.

01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:35.890
PERCY: Good Sovereign, if I can have a moment?

01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:39.580
Did I hear correctly that

01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:42.040
Lord and Lady Briarwood were in town?

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.440
URIEL: "They were but a week ago."

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:45.660
PERCY: They were but a week ago?

01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:47.660
And they've left, have they?

01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:50.640
URIEL: "Yes. Do you know of Lord and Lady Briarwood?"

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:52.490
PERCY: Just in passing.

01:25:52.490 --> 01:25:55.170
Did they have business in town?

01:25:55.170 --> 01:25:56.610
Was there something in particular?

01:25:56.610 --> 01:25:59.320
I'm just curious. It doesn't really matter.

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.450
I mean it does matter but not particularly.

01:26:01.450 --> 01:26:05.240
URIEL: "It was relatively routine, we're establishing

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.940
"an official trade route through the northeast.

01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:08.940
"Spanning the Boreal Plane to Whitestone."

01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:09.720
PERCY: Oh.

01:26:11.410 --> 01:26:13.470
URIEL: "They inherited the region after

01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:15.530
"the unfortunate demise of the Derolo family."

01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:16.600
PERCY: Yes.

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.690
URIEL: "However our ambassador has noted

01:26:18.690 --> 01:26:20.800
"that they've rebuilt rather well and honored

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:21.630
"the memory of the family

01:26:21.630 --> 01:26:25.080
"and they're really committed to reestablishing

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.710
"the foothold of Whitestone in the north.

01:26:27.710 --> 01:26:30.290
"So they came here on a diplomatic mission to open trade."

01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:36.680
PERCY: That's nice.

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:40.370
I would love to. Please, keep it quiet,

01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:45.300
but if I could be notified if they're coming through again.

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:48.510
I would like very much to surprise them,

01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:50.040
if that would be possible.

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.040
ORION: Am I standing next to Percy?

01:26:52.590 --> 01:26:53.330
Am I hearing this?

01:26:53.330 --> 01:26:53.790
MATT: Yes.

01:26:53.790 --> 01:26:54.430
ORION: Good.

01:26:54.430 --> 01:26:58.560
PERCY: It's just old business.

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.430
It would be very interesting to see them again.

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:02.240
MATT: For the sake of this conversation,

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:03.700
I'm going to ask you to roll a deception check.

01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:04.600
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:09.480
Natural 20.

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:10.660
MARISHA: (cheers)

01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:11.550
ORION: (claps)

01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:12.880
MARISHA: On the new pretty die.

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:13.930
TALIESIN: Don't fuck with me.

01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:17.580
MATT: The Sovereign gives you a look and says,

01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:19.020
URIEL: "Certainly.

01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:21.180
"Very well, I will notify you

01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:22.010
"should they come through again."

01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:23.740
PERCY: Deeply honored by your thought, sir. Thank you.

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:25.630
ORION: At the end of this conversation I'm going to

01:27:25.630 --> 01:27:27.730
rip off a piece of the scroll of telescription

01:27:27.730 --> 01:27:28.910
and I'm going to approach.

01:27:29.290 --> 01:27:31.790
TIBERIUS: When you do, all you do is

01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:34.020
write the message to this and we will receive it.

01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:36.560
It's an enchanted parchment.

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.250
I will receive the message.

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:39.800
MATT: He tells you,

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:42.220
URIEL: "I know how these work. Yes, thank you."

01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:44.100
MATT: As you present it, he walks by and

01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:46.460
one of his guards takes it from you and gives you a nod.

01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:47.920
MATT: They exit the chambers.

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:50.120
You guys are escorted out into the main hallway of the palace.

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:50.820
PIKE: Bye!
MATT: The rest of the council

01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:51.870
MATT: The rest of the council

01:27:51.870 --> 01:27:54.650
scatters amongst the palace proper. You are all left.

01:27:54.650 --> 01:27:58.240
The doors close behind you and the echoing hallways

01:27:58.240 --> 01:27:59.860
towards the central left side of the palace.

01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:00.560
PERCY: (sighs)

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:01.230
KEYLETH: Percy.

01:28:01.230 --> 01:28:01.940
PERCY: I'm fine.

01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:02.660
PIKE: Are you okay?
KEYLETH: You're sweating.

01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:03.440
PERCY: I know.
PIKE: Are you okay?

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:04.420
KEYLETH: Why are you sweating?

01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:05.000
PERCY: It's hot.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:05.680
KEYLETH: What happened?

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:06.340
PERCY: Nothing.

01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:08.340
The sun comes up and it gets very hot.

01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:09.230
I'll tell you later.

01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:10.320
TIBERIUS: Very good.

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:12.010
PERCY: This is discussion for later.

01:28:12.010 --> 01:28:13.840
There's more important things.

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:17.470
MATT: Kima and Allura are near you.

01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:20.000
At which point, Kima looks at the rest of you and says,

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.370
KIMA: "I apologize, I have to figure this out now.

01:28:24.370 --> 01:28:26.130
"So I'm going to head to the nearest temple of Bahamut

01:28:26.130 --> 01:28:27.240
"and see if we could reach out quickly."

01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:31.980
KEYLETH: What should we do?

01:28:33.710 --> 01:28:35.000
KIMA: That's up to you.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.330
MATT: She looks to Allura, questioning Allura.

01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:41.520
ALLURA: "In the event of this

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:44.040
"blessed chamber arriving, you will be notified.

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:45.890
"We will request your presence

01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:48.690
"to bring the artifact in question, seal it,

01:28:48.690 --> 01:28:51.280
"and then we will begin our journey over to its place

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:55.930
"of hopeful destruction and/or proper banishment."

01:28:55.930 --> 01:28:57.570
PIKE: Would you like anyone to go with you

01:28:57.570 --> 01:28:58.970
or you just want to go alone?

01:29:00.270 --> 01:29:00.990
ALLURA: "To?"

01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:04.570
PIKE: To work out the details of all of this?

01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:10.210
MATT: Allura says,

01:29:10.210 --> 01:29:11.310
ALLURA: "For me, it's just preparation of

01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:12.910
"the arcane transference ritual.

01:29:12.910 --> 01:29:14.100
"I'm going to go meet with a friend of mine

01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:16.960
"over in Ostania."

01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:19.450
PERCY: I will say we haven't replenished our potions yet.

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:20.850
And we could go --

01:29:20.850 --> 01:29:23.040
PIKE: Should we go to visit our old friend?

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:24.350
KEYLETH: Gilmore?

01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:24.750
PERCY: We could go to Gilmore's.
KEYLETH: Gilmore?

01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:25.620
PIKE: Gilmore?
PERCY: We could go to Gilmore's.

01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:26.890
PIKE: Gilmore's Glorious Goods?

01:29:27.730 --> 01:29:30.240
KEYLETH: You essentially want us to wait?

01:29:32.530 --> 01:29:33.620
ALLURA: "Whatever business you need to get done.

01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:34.660
"It should take no more than two days

01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:36.920
"to get this taken care of."

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:40.130
KEYLETH: You guys, we have a weekend!

01:29:40.130 --> 01:29:41.310
(all laugh)

01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:43.770
LIAM: This is Allura and Kima who are here?

01:29:43.770 --> 01:29:44.500
MATT: Yeah, they're the only two who have

01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:46.660
stayed behind with you guys outside of the council chambers.

01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:51.460
LIAM: I take Pike by the hand and I walk over to Kima.

01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:53.700
And they're short so I kneel down.

01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:55.800
I say to the both of them.

01:29:56.290 --> 01:29:58.920
VAX: I've never pretended to be a man of the cloth,

01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.920
I know little of the gods.

01:30:01.210 --> 01:30:05.900
But the brush we had down below has left me shaken.

01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:09.900
What can the gods tell us?

01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:12.690
The gods stick their noses into our doings

01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:14.440
whenever it pleases them.

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:16.160
Are they not here?

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:19.160
Have they anything to say for what is happening now?

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:22.040
MARISHA: I'm with this guy! High five Vax.

01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:27.120
MATT: At which point-- did you wish to respond in any way?

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:29.330
PIKE: Well, I just know that

01:30:29.330 --> 01:30:34.900
I tried to have a response from my god down below

01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:38.170
and she didn't really respond the way

01:30:38.170 --> 01:30:40.520
I would have liked for her to.

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.830
But maybe things will be different.

01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:45.080
What were you going to say?

01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:48.280
MATT: At which point Kima looks to you,

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:51.870
at what you just said with curious worry.

01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:57.210
KIMA: "Well, if what you say is your faith has been shaken,

01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:01.850
"there is always room at the temple of Bahamut

01:31:01.850 --> 01:31:04.820
"to find redemption, strength, and guidance.

01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:05.890
"You realize the platinum --"

01:31:05.890 --> 01:31:07.280
MARISHA: She's trying to get you to come to her church.

01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:07.980
MATT: (laughs)

01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:09.240
PIKE: She's trying to convert.

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:11.650
MARISHA: She's trying to convert! Get the leaflet.

01:31:11.650 --> 01:31:13.290
KIMA: "The platinum dragon has guided

01:31:13.290 --> 01:31:16.530
"much of civilization's growth, expansion, and survival

01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:18.730
"for thousands of years.

01:31:18.730 --> 01:31:21.960
"The eternal battle between him and the darkness

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:23.550
"that is Tiamat and the chaos beyond that --"

01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:26.580
KEYLETH: With all due respect, Kima,

01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:28.940
I don't think that was Vax's question.

01:31:30.670 --> 01:31:33.630
KIMA: "To get to the point, I apologize.

01:31:33.630 --> 01:31:36.820
"The gods are many and the gods have been

01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:38.650
"at war for as long as we exist.

01:31:38.650 --> 01:31:41.920
"There are some that believe we are nothing but

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:45.020
"the aftermath of their squabbles.

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:47.480
"But nevertheless, there is much good

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:50.130
"in this world that guides us to our ultimate destiny.

01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:51.900
"And if you yourself ever feel that

01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:54.660
"you are lost amongst this chaos,

01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:57.140
"don't ever be afraid to stop in

01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:58.780
"and ask a few questions."

01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:02.260
VAX: I was just wondering if I could ask you

01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:04.680
to ask them, to maybe help.

01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:06.520
I would never think to ask the gods for help

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:10.640
if I wanted a shiny new sword or pile of riches,

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.330
but this is something different.

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:15.980
GROG: Unless they could get us a pile of riches.

01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:17.070
VEX: Or a shining sword.

01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:18.490
VAX: Good boy.

01:32:18.490 --> 01:32:20.410
(all laugh)

01:32:20.410 --> 01:32:23.020
MATT: At which point Kima laughs to herself.

01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:28.800
KIMA: "There are benefits to being of the order."

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.240
MATT: Kima who does not have an accent

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:33.260
and did not say it that way.

01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:39.080
Too many NPCs in  my head right now. She says,

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:42.190
KIMA: "But, understand.

01:32:42.190 --> 01:32:44.820
"Whenever I felt lost, which was often.

01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:49.040
"It's good to have that guiding warmth to turn to.

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:53.780
"And sometimes it brings you into a subterranean mountain

01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:55.450
"being tortured by dwarves.

01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:59.140
"Sometimes it guides you to new friends and allies.

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:00.560
"Strange the way the gods work.

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:03.770
"But, when you put your all into it,

01:33:03.770 --> 01:33:05.290
"they've kept me alive so far."

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:08.640
PIKE: That's a really good point.

01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:10.980
I guess that's a positive way to look at it.

01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:13.550
KEYLETH: I really like long walks in the forest

01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:15.370
when I'm feeling disconnected.

01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:18.090
PIKE: That works too, you know.

01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:21.630
GROG: Lady Kima,

01:33:21.630 --> 01:33:26.300
do the gods allow you to have relationships?

01:33:28.290 --> 01:33:31.310
MATT: Kima, you ask this and she gives you

01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:34.340
a look of confusion, and thenâ€¦

01:33:35.210 --> 01:33:38.220
She already a darker complexion for a halfling

01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:42.140
but her cheeks grow noticeably ruddier.

01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:44.140
She averts her gaze and says,

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:48.060
KIMA: "Well..."

01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:50.980
TRAVIS: I start trying to do my best Vax wink.

01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:51.660
LAURA: I'm Vex.

01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:52.690
TRAVIS: --Vex wink.

01:33:52.690 --> 01:33:54.590
(all laugh)

01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:57.200
MATT: She averts her gaze and goes,

01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:01.540
KIMA: "Well, as far as I know

01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:07.000
it is not a vow of chastity within the order."

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.600
GROG: So you're saying there's a chance.

01:34:11.210 --> 01:34:13.610
MATT: She still is looking away.

01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:15.710
She looks away and looks to the rest of you.

01:34:15.710 --> 01:34:19.480
Looks to Allura. Looks to you again. And then goes,

01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:21.210
KIMA: "I really have to get to work on this."

01:34:21.210 --> 01:34:22.300
TALIESIN: You did this.
KIMA: "I really have to get to work on this."

01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:25.660
MATT: She leaves the group and continues down the hallway.

01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:26.850
Quick steps.

01:34:26.850 --> 01:34:28.060
PIKE: Bye, Kima!
Quick steps.

01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:30.190
VAX: A lot of math involved in that equation.

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:31.550
KEYLETH: Yeah...

01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:32.860
MATT: Allura chuckles to herself

01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:34.480
and steps into the place where she was and goes,

01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:35.650
TIBERIUS: I care not to solve the puzzle.

01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:39.370
ALLURA: "Oh, as a note.

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:45.050
"Be careful who you ask those questions to,

01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:46.830
"you may get an earful."

01:34:46.830 --> 01:34:50.270
MATT: And Allura smiles and motions towards Kima.

01:34:50.970 --> 01:34:51.610
ALLURA: "Don't get me wrong,

01:34:51.610 --> 01:34:53.380
"you're more than welcome to explore as you like,

01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:55.980
"but that's a rabbit hole my friend."

01:34:57.410 --> 01:34:58.380
GROG: A rabbit hole,

01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:00.930
is that what we're calling it these days?

01:35:02.490 --> 01:35:04.570
MATT: You feel a gentle slap

01:35:04.570 --> 01:35:07.770
from some unknown arcane force across your cheek Grog.

01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:11.460
And Allura gives you a stern glare.

01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:13.920
MARISHA: Oh, don't talk about her girl that way.

01:35:15.550 --> 01:35:17.060
LIAM: Don't make me take my earrings off.

01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:18.460
MATT: Anyway.

01:35:20.110 --> 01:35:21.410
ALLURA: "So two days.

01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:25.970
"We'll call for you when the item is to be transferred

01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:29.330
"and properly brought to its destination.

01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:31.130
"In the meantime, prepare as you see fit,

01:35:31.130 --> 01:35:33.130
"enjoy this well-earned rest,

01:35:33.130 --> 01:35:35.400
"and we'll take it from there.

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:38.340
"I have much travel to do myself.

01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:39.460
"See you all very soon."

01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:41.870
MATT: She begins to step up the hallway.

01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:43.290
As she steps up the hallway, you can see

01:35:43.290 --> 01:35:47.100
there's a light yellowish glow about her form.

01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:49.100
Then with a sudden flash of white light,

01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:50.590
Allura's just gone.

01:35:53.610 --> 01:35:57.500
KEYLETH: So guys. I'm thinking we take a local tour

01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:00.300
of all the historical highlights of Emon.

01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:02.660
We've never really gone sightseeing,

01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:06.200
Then maybe we can catch a nice dinner in the city tonight.

01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:08.590
VEX: Oh, look at the time.

01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:09.940
GROG: Oh, it's getting so late.

01:36:10.670 --> 01:36:14.050
KEYLETH: It's 1pm.

01:36:14.050 --> 01:36:15.160
We've got the whole day

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:17.880
PERCY: It feels like eight. It really feels so late.

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:19.550
KEYLETH: I picked up one of these pamphlets

01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:20.760
while we were in the palace

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:24.780
and apparently there's a nice natural history museum.

01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:25.870
PERCY: Gilmore's? Gilmore's?

01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:28.930
TIBERIUS: Your highness, what is a pam-phlet?

01:36:28.930 --> 01:36:30.110
PERCY: Gilmore's?

01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:31.610
TIBERIUS: Oh, a lot of paper.

01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:32.910
PERCY: I'll be at Gilmore's.

01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:34.040
TIBERIUS: Oh, it's like a mini book!

01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.440
KEYLETH: It's like a tiny scroll.

01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:36.580
TIBERIUS: It has pictures!

01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:37.200
KEYLETH: Yes!

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:37.680
TIBERIUS: Look, Percy!

01:36:38.130 --> 01:36:40.290
TALIESIN: I'm already heading towards Gilmore's.

01:36:40.290 --> 01:36:41.520
LIAM: I'm following Percy.

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:43.760
TRAVIS: We're going to Gilmore's, too.

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.110
MATT: All right. You guys exit and find your way,

01:36:46.110 --> 01:36:48.020
exiting the palace and the cloudtop district

01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:49.880
to make your way to Abedar's Promenade

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:53.310
to enter and reunite with your good friend Gilmore.

01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:55.100
MATT: We're going to take this moment to take a break,

01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:56.850
use the restroom, get some food.

01:36:56.850 --> 01:36:59.330
TALIESIN: We're at two? Are we at two more?

01:36:59.330 --> 01:37:00.640
ZAC: Giveaway time!

01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:01.740
MATT: Oh, it's giveaway time.

01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:03.170
(Background: Snuggle Lord, Snuggle Lord)
All right, we hit our next giveaway so we'll do that first.

01:37:03.170 --> 01:37:03.980
All right, we hit our next giveaway so we'll do that first.

01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:05.860
(Background: Snuggle Lord, Snuggle Lord)
All right, so we have --

01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:06.580
MATT: Oh no.

01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:09.470
MARISHA: Snuggle Lord?!

01:37:10.810 --> 01:37:12.660
MARISHA: It's a Snuggle Lord variant!

01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:16.830
TALIESIN: Snuggle Lord, Snuggle Lord.

01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:19.480
LIAM: There he is.

01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:21.490
(all cheer)

01:37:21.490 --> 01:37:23.290
MARISHA: Snuggle Lord has returned!

01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:27.610
MATT: There you go, there is Snuggle Lord in his glory.
MARISHA: No, not the horns of Orcus!

01:37:27.610 --> 01:37:29.340
ORION: No, now he has the power!

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:32.050
(all laugh)

01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:33.890
ZAC: We hit our second giveaway.

01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:36.820
(all cheer)

01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:39.790
ZAC: We're going to give one of these away.

01:37:40.650 --> 01:37:43.860
All you have to do is be active in the chat room, guys.

01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:47.000
So, if you're watching full screen,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.320
get out of full screen, be active.

01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:51.420
She can't see it, can she?

01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:52.770
MATT: No, she can see it though.

01:37:52.770 --> 01:37:53.940
MARISHA: Can't see.

01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:56.210
MARISHA: Can you see it? Gotta tilt it down a bit.

01:37:56.210 --> 01:37:57.330
LAURA: There we go, it's so cute.

01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:03.650
ZAC: All right guys be active in the chat room.

01:38:03.650 --> 01:38:04.810
We're going to let these guys take a break.

01:38:04.810 --> 01:38:06.450
When we come back from the break, we'll announce the winner.

01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:09.400
MARISHA: Do we have a word?

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:10.680
ZAC: Oh yeah, go for it.

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:11.530
MARISHA: Here we'll use the word

01:38:11.530 --> 01:38:13.230
KommissarProps in the chat room.

01:38:13.230 --> 01:38:14.620
ZAC: I'll have to go set it up.

01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:15.870
Okay, I gotta run.

01:38:15.870 --> 01:38:17.310
MATT: Go set it up.

01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:20.250
So hold that thought, until he starts it.

01:38:20.250 --> 01:38:21.980
The word will be KommissarProps.

01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:23.100
MARISHA: Say KommissarProps

01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:24.420
and definitely go follow Kai on Instagram and on Facebook

01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:25.930
MATT: These horns will be yours.
and definitely go follow Kai on Instagram and on Facebook

01:38:25.930 --> 01:38:27.060
and definitely go follow Kai on Instagram and on Facebook

01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:29.810
because he was awesome enough to make these horns for us.

01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:34.650
So Instagram and Facebook,

01:38:34.650 --> 01:38:36.140
that's where all the pretty pictures are.

01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:38.190
MATT: You yourself can be corrupted by the evil of Orcus.

01:38:38.190 --> 01:38:40.990
MARISHA: You yourself can be corrupted if you go and find him.

01:38:40.990 --> 01:38:42.440
TALIESIN: Watch him while he sleeps.

01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:44.340
MATT: You and RhymesWithOrange can be

01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:46.340
the two keepers of the two horns of Orcus

01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:48.620
and bring ruin to the entire world of Exandria.

01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:49.550
So that could be you.

01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:51.150
Anyway, we're taking a break. We'll see you guys back here

01:38:51.150 --> 01:38:52.220
in a little over ten minutes

01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:55.300
and we'll continue as they head towardsâ€¦

01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:56.800
Gilmore's Glorious Goods.

01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:57.480
TALIESIN: Gilmore's!

01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:00.200
MATT: All right, I gotta prepare. See you soon guys.

01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:40.840
MATT: Hey guys, welcome back.

01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:44.600
Weâ€™re about to get in some game time again here in a second,

01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:48.670
but first we have our second winner to win the second

01:54:48.670 --> 01:54:51.870
horn of Orcus for the eveningâ€™s giveaway.

01:54:51.870 --> 01:54:53.970
Weâ€™re really excited to announce the winner of the

01:54:53.970 --> 01:54:56.330
second playerâ€™s handbook signed by the group,

01:54:56.330 --> 01:54:58.970
the dice kit, as well as this horn,

01:54:58.970 --> 01:55:00.770
is Ember72.

01:55:00.770 --> 01:55:03.160
MATT: Ember72, congratulations.

01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:05.420
TRAVIS: Ember72!
MATT: You get to have this one.

01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:07.780
Itâ€™s awesome, really stoked.

01:55:07.780 --> 01:55:09.690
We now have both of these horns given away.

01:55:09.690 --> 01:55:10.880
And while these are the only

01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:12.810
horns of Orcus thatâ€™ll be out there,

01:55:12.810 --> 01:55:15.200
our fantastic propmaster over here,

01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:17.130
Kai, Kommissar Props,

01:55:17.130 --> 01:55:19.180
will be working with us in the future to do more

01:55:19.180 --> 01:55:20.860
Critical Role-based prop giveaways.

01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:22.860
And once again, definitely check out his work,

01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:24.580
heâ€™s an amazing fabricator and propmaster.

01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:25.880
ASHLEY: Those are the only two?
heâ€™s an amazing fabricator and propmaster.

01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:27.650
MATT: These are the only two thatâ€™re gonna go out.

01:55:27.650 --> 01:55:28.180
TALIESIN: Theyâ€™re the only two in the world.

01:55:28.180 --> 01:55:29.550
ASHLEY: Thatâ€™s really special.
TALIESIN: Theyâ€™re the only two in the world.

01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:33.100
ZAC: At 3600 weâ€™ll do the starter kit, t-shirt --

01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:34.880
ASHLEY: That sounded insincere, but I really meant it.

01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:35.640
MATT: Yeah.

01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:36.960
TRAVIS: That did sound insincere.

01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:40.010
MATT: Weâ€™ll see somewhere down the road.

01:55:40.010 --> 01:55:41.360
If we want to put out more stuff, weâ€™ll see.

01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:44.600
But right now these are just an exclusive giveaway.

01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:46.420
Excited for those two guys. So everyone once again

01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:48.090
for Rhymeswithorange and Ember72,

01:55:48.090 --> 01:55:49.050
congratulations on those bits.

01:55:49.050 --> 01:55:51.230
MARISHA: Or maybe if you follow Kommissar Props,

01:55:51.230 --> 01:55:53.950
weâ€™ll do another giveaway to the people who follow him.

01:55:53.950 --> 01:55:57.380
MATT: Helping friends out because they do awesome work.

01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:00.930
Congratulations on that. If we can get to 3600

01:56:00.930 --> 01:56:02.540
weâ€™re gonna be doing some dance after the show,

01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:04.490
so hopefully we can hit that subscriber number tonight.

01:56:04.490 --> 01:56:05.210
ZAC: Plus giveaway.

01:56:05.210 --> 01:56:05.810
MATT: Plus giveaway.

01:56:05.810 --> 01:56:08.930
Plus the signed t-shirt, the dice box, starter kit, so.

01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:13.310
MATT: Good stuff. All right, bringing us back to the game.

01:56:13.610 --> 01:56:14.720
ASHLEY: Gilmore!

01:56:15.010 --> 01:56:15.980
MATT: So you guys,

01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:18.820
you make your way outside of the Castletop District

01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:21.320
into the center of Emon proper.

01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:22.840
Returning to Abedarâ€™s Promenade,

01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:26.650
which is the largest central section of the city,

01:56:26.650 --> 01:56:30.320
where most of the merchantile itself seems to have

01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:32.810
gathered and been a serious conglomerate

01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:34.570
where all business in this city happens.

01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:38.330
Those who would like a quick little visual

01:56:38.330 --> 01:56:40.330
idea of the city, this is Emon.

01:56:40.650 --> 01:56:42.260
MATT: Right there. Itâ€™s a small little --

01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:46.920
--there is an amazing printout of this that theyâ€™ve,

01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:48.920
actually Laura and Travis, have framed

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:52.090
and put up in their room sometime. Weâ€™ll have to go ahead

01:56:52.090 --> 01:56:53.070
and bring on the show and show you guys.

01:56:53.070 --> 01:56:55.440
LAURA: Weâ€™re gonna bring it to put on the set.

01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:56.090
At some point.

01:56:56.090 --> 01:56:58.040
MATT: Yeah, weâ€™ll have it too. Anyway,

01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:00.280
the Castletop District is here, the inner portion.

01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:01.890
You guys have made your way out south

01:57:01.890 --> 01:57:03.890
to the Central District

01:57:03.890 --> 01:57:06.100
and then towards Abedarâ€™s Promenade,

01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:08.980
which is right over here.

01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:10.360
So you guys wouldâ€™ve gone this way, actually.

01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:11.890
So youâ€™re out to Abedarâ€™s Promenade in the far

01:57:11.890 --> 01:57:14.860
eastern side of Emon, where you

01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:16.600
eventually find your way to the outskirts

01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:20.210
of your favorite purveyor of arcane mystical artifacts.

01:57:20.210 --> 01:57:21.650
MARISHA: Gilmore!

01:57:21.650 --> 01:57:23.650
MATT: Shaun Gilmore himself.

01:57:23.650 --> 01:57:24.940
MARISHA: Shaun Gilmore.

01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:26.220
MATT: So as you guys --

01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:27.170
ASHLEY: Is that his first name?

01:57:27.170 --> 01:57:28.740
MARISHA: I didnâ€™t know Shaun was his first name either.

01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:29.220
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: I didnâ€™t know Shaun was his first name either.

01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:30.140
TALIESIN: Youâ€™ve not been paying attention.

01:57:30.140 --> 01:57:31.710
MATT: Shaun Gilmore, but youâ€™ve always called him Gilmore.

01:57:31.710 --> 01:57:33.710
MARISHA: Weâ€™re on a first-name basis now, guys.

01:57:33.710 --> 01:57:36.180
MATT: No oneâ€™s on a first-name basis with Gilmore.

01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:36.670
MARISHA: We are.

01:57:36.670 --> 01:57:37.630
MATT: Gilmore is Gilmore.

01:57:37.630 --> 01:57:39.150
MARISHA: Except for maybe Vax over there.

01:57:39.150 --> 01:57:40.500
MATT: Except for maybe, maybe Vax.

01:57:40.890 --> 01:57:42.440
MATT: So at this point now

01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:44.530
youâ€™re pushing about two in the afternoon.

01:57:44.530 --> 01:57:46.030
Itâ€™s extremely busy, you can hear the

01:57:46.030 --> 01:57:48.910
clopping of horse hooves on the ground,

01:57:48.910 --> 01:57:50.110
people are walking past.

01:57:50.110 --> 01:57:52.290
Youâ€™d swear as youâ€™re stepping through the city,

01:57:52.290 --> 01:57:54.430
maybe a handful of people tend to stop

01:57:54.430 --> 01:57:57.310
and watch you guys walk through, stunned.

01:57:57.310 --> 01:57:59.770
Almost like theyâ€™d seen a celebrity on the street,

01:57:59.770 --> 01:58:02.650
as the most recent makeup of the Winterâ€™s Crest festival

01:58:02.650 --> 01:58:05.740
was a celebration of you being the heroes

01:58:05.740 --> 01:58:08.610
who saved the city of Emon and the sovereign and his family.

01:58:09.450 --> 01:58:12.560
Apparently you are now recognizable within the city of Emon.

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:13.340
LIAM: My sister winks.

01:58:13.340 --> 01:58:14.350
TRAVIS: Yeah we are.

01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:19.220
MATT: All right, so Vax wills Vex to wink.

01:58:19.220 --> 01:58:21.130
Vex, do you accept this wink from your brother?

01:58:21.130 --> 01:58:21.870
LAURA: I do.

01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:22.430
MATT: All right.

01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:23.120
LAURA: Other way.

01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:24.380
MATT: Perfect, there you go.

01:58:24.380 --> 01:58:25.320
LAURA: Just a little more.

01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:28.490
MATT: Perfect. Weâ€™ve lined it up.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.880
As you walk across the main thoroughfare,

01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:35.470
you make your way to the wide but single-story building

01:58:35.470 --> 01:58:37.930
that is Gilmoreâ€™s Glorious Goods.

01:58:37.930 --> 01:58:41.960
Of all the various shades of brown and red and brick

01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:42.920
that makes up all these buildings,

01:58:42.920 --> 01:58:46.180
Gilmoreâ€™s Glorious Goods is presented in

01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:50.360
fine, deep blue and purple fabric and a paint scheme

01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:52.610
that would look like the worst funhouse to enter.

01:58:52.610 --> 01:58:55.460
Worst or best, depending on your opinion.

01:58:55.460 --> 01:59:00.350
The entranceway is not a door but a series of hanging beads and

01:59:00.350 --> 01:59:03.400
large cloth drapes that are gently falling

01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:05.420
to be brushed aside as you enter.

01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:10.900
Itâ€™s not as big as you remember, or recall, seemingly.

01:59:10.900 --> 01:59:13.710
But as you step through the front door you remember why.

01:59:13.710 --> 01:59:14.890
Much like the TARDIS,

01:59:14.890 --> 01:59:18.080
the interior of Gilmoreâ€™s Goods is bigger on the inside.

01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:21.060
There is a magical enchantment based within this building

01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:23.230
where the interior is actually a two-story

01:59:23.230 --> 01:59:25.780
and much larger place of business.

01:59:26.270 --> 01:59:30.520
Immediately the smells of incense and

01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:32.940
fine perfumes assault your nose --

01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:34.190
GROG: Ugh!
fine perfumes assault your nose --

01:59:34.190 --> 01:59:36.510
MATT: Like a terrible medieval Sephora.

01:59:36.510 --> 01:59:37.320
VAX: Like coming home.

01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:38.730
ASHLEY: Medieval Sephora.

01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:46.840
MATT: A series of magically flickering ever-burning candles

01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:49.150
adorn sconces along the walls.

01:59:49.150 --> 01:59:50.700
You can see there are glass cases

01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:52.190
set out in the center of the room,

01:59:52.190 --> 01:59:54.020
there is the long wooden bar on the far end

01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:56.380
which has itself its own beaded curtain that is closed,

01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:59.370
and there are three employees of Gilmoreâ€™s Glorious Goods in their

01:59:59.370 --> 02:00:02.520
ceremonial blue and purple robes that match the exterior,

02:00:03.730 --> 02:00:06.510
staring about while there a number of other

02:00:06.510 --> 02:00:08.510
possible customers that are looking about.

02:00:08.510 --> 02:00:11.730
There are numerous bookshelves along the walls.

02:00:11.730 --> 02:00:13.180
You can see there is,

02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:16.970
next to the stairway on the far left side of this floor,

02:00:16.970 --> 02:00:18.650
there is an herbalist who specializes

02:00:18.650 --> 02:00:20.400
in dried herbs and sales in that regard.

02:00:21.060 --> 02:00:23.760
You haven't been to the upstairs yet in this complex.

02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:26.420
But you now are standing back in the comfortable,

02:00:26.420 --> 02:00:31.680
although slightly offensive to your senses,

02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:33.560
interior of Gilmore's Glorious Goods.

02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:35.640
LIAM: I'm scanning the entire store for him.

02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:36.340
I want to find him.

02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:37.440
MATT: He's not currently visible.

02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:39.490
LIAM: Oh! He's not here?

02:00:39.490 --> 02:00:41.390
MATT: He's not visible. Not in the main room.

02:00:42.130 --> 02:00:43.060
LIAM: All right.

02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:43.780
ASHLEY: He has his private office.

02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:44.510
VEX: Brother.
ASHLEY: He has his private office.

02:00:44.510 --> 02:00:45.520
VAX: Yes?

02:00:45.940 --> 02:00:49.200
VEX: You should get that evil Clarota helmet checked out

02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:50.840
and see what all good it does us.

02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:51.600
VAX: What, this one?

02:00:52.970 --> 02:00:53.760
VEX: Yep. That one.

02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:54.350
VAX: Yes.

02:00:56.460 --> 02:00:57.420
KEYLETH: Vax.

02:00:57.420 --> 02:00:57.970
VAX: Yes?

02:00:57.970 --> 02:00:59.840
KEYLETH: I say you'd be the point man here.

02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:00.580
VAX: I think so.

02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:01.410
TIBERIUS: I would agree.

02:01:01.410 --> 02:01:02.580
PIKE: I think that's a really good plan.

02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:06.030
PERCY: I second that notion. Quintuple it.

02:01:06.030 --> 02:01:07.790
KEYLETH: Yeah. The twinsies should go.

02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:09.610
VAX: Start looking around. Start shopping.

02:01:09.610 --> 02:01:12.910
Don't pay for anything yet, because I have an arrangement.

02:01:12.910 --> 02:01:14.000
PIKE: He can get a little discount.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.290
VEX: He can get a little

02:01:15.290 --> 02:01:17.720
wink, wink, nudge, nudge discount.

02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:20.440
MARISHA: I go up to Vax.

02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:23.100
I put my hands on his shoulders, and I say,

02:01:24.450 --> 02:01:25.330
KEYLETH: You got this.

02:01:25.330 --> 02:01:28.080
MARISHA: And I cast Enhance Ability on him.

02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:29.130
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:01:29.130 --> 02:01:32.030
MARISHA: For charisma? I'm assuming?

02:01:32.030 --> 02:01:34.910
LIAM: Let's make my hair even glossier than it already is.

02:01:34.910 --> 02:01:37.120
MARISHA:  And I give him a little bit of the dad thumb.

02:01:38.810 --> 02:01:39.530
LIAM: I know that thumb.

02:01:39.530 --> 02:01:40.010
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:41.310
TRAVIS: The dad thumb?

02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:43.370
MARISHA: Wipe the morning breakfast off of him

02:01:43.370 --> 02:01:45.660
before I send him on to school.

02:01:46.430 --> 02:01:47.010
MATT: (laughs quietly)

02:01:47.010 --> 02:01:48.700
MARISHA: And I give him a little love tap

02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:51.150
on his behind and send him on his way.

02:01:51.150 --> 02:01:51.950
ASHLEY: Send him on his merry way.

02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:52.840
MATT: All right.

02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:54.000
TALIESIN: Shoulder massage.

02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:57.310
MATT: All righty. So?

02:01:57.610 --> 02:01:59.200
MARISHA: So you have advantage rolls on all charisma rolls.

02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:00.130
LIAM: Is there a front desk?

02:02:00.130 --> 02:02:01.330
ORION: (package crinkling)
LIAM: Is there a front desk?

02:02:01.330 --> 02:02:04.400
MATT: On the far back side, there is a very long,

02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:07.120
well-crafted dark wood desk that is adorned

02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:08.620
with what looks like small alchemical components,

02:02:08.620 --> 02:02:10.260
(package crinkling)
with what looks like small alchemical components,

02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:11.740
glass tubing and --
(package crinkling)

02:02:12.330 --> 02:02:14.080
Be a little louder with those Red Vines.

02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:15.690
ORION: Sorry. Do you want one?

02:02:15.690 --> 02:02:16.720
MATT: I'm good, thank you.

02:02:18.900 --> 02:02:20.280
ASHLEY: (laughs)

02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:21.610
MATT: We're good.

02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:25.360
You can see there are a number of glass containers

02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:29.290
and small corked vials --

02:02:29.290 --> 02:02:32.740
LIAM: I'm sorry, he's looking for Gilmore.

02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:34.510
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:02:34.510 --> 02:02:36.270
LIAM: They're going to flirt together.

02:02:36.270 --> 02:02:37.410
MATT: (laughs)

02:02:37.410 --> 02:02:38.940
TIBERIUS: It's like watching a movie.

02:02:38.940 --> 02:02:40.940
MARISHA: (giggles)

02:02:41.860 --> 02:02:42.400
LIAM: Sorry.

02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:44.660
MATT: It's all right. There are some books stacked up.

02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:48.730
There is a small, embedded glass case

02:02:48.730 --> 02:02:50.780
that seems to have a couple of items that are under

02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:53.620
a purplish-maroon, velvet piece of material

02:02:53.620 --> 02:02:55.370
that's currently covering them.

02:02:55.370 --> 02:02:58.330
There is that beaded curtain with strips of material

02:02:58.330 --> 02:02:59.730
that block the back room.

02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:03.080
LIAM: Okay, and there's a person manning the --

02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:05.080
MATT: No, not currently. It is just an empty desk.

02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:06.410
LIAM: Is there a bell or anything?

02:03:06.410 --> 02:03:07.240
MATT: There is a bell.

02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:08.500
LIAM: Yeah.

02:03:10.050 --> 02:03:12.480
MATT: As you hit the bell, one of the employees

02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:13.700
who is helping somebody looks around and goes,

02:03:14.930 --> 02:03:16.090
EMPLOYEE: "I'm sorry."

02:03:16.090 --> 02:03:17.600
MATT: What you see is

02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:21.010
a half-elven woman with thick spectacles

02:03:21.010 --> 02:03:22.780
who is currently stepping over to try and stop you.

02:03:22.780 --> 02:03:25.220
However, the beaded curtain swishes open

02:03:25.220 --> 02:03:29.840
with the grandiose gesture of one slightly meaty hand.

02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:34.980
Stepping out in his fine, gold-trimmed, purple robes,

02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:39.470
his longish thick, black, coarse hair

02:03:39.470 --> 02:03:41.240
pulled into a nice ponytail.

02:03:42.270 --> 02:03:46.620
Smoothly-shaved face with a slight hint of a braided goatee

02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:48.570
that dangles about three inches from his chin.

02:03:48.570 --> 02:03:51.410
LIAM: Will you remind me because it's been a while.

02:03:51.410 --> 02:03:53.220
Gilmore's a good-looking man, though, isn't he?

02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:54.160
MATT: Yeah. He's handsome.

02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:54.650
LIAM: Yeah.

02:03:54.650 --> 02:03:56.980
MARISHA: Is the braid new? Is that a new addition?

02:03:56.980 --> 02:03:58.040
LAURA: He's so handsome, Vax.

02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:01.450
MARISHA: The braid's new. He decided to rock the braid.

02:04:02.410 --> 02:04:03.450
Go for it!

02:04:03.450 --> 02:04:05.220
MATT: Gilmore's a very handsome gentleman.

02:04:06.900 --> 02:04:10.910
I would say he's not fit and muscular.

02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:14.340
He is a handsome, comfortably jovial gentleman.

02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:16.650
LIAM: I'm picturing Jeremy Irons in a wizard robe.

02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:19.130
MATT: Kind of. Imagine him with a little more paunch.

02:04:19.130 --> 02:04:19.560
LIAM: Okay.

02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:22.400
MATT: But very charismatic.

02:04:23.290 --> 02:04:25.810
Open chest to his vest, with a number of gold chains

02:04:25.810 --> 02:04:28.270
and medallions that dangle around.

02:04:28.270 --> 02:04:28.890
LIAM: I feel you.

02:04:28.890 --> 02:04:31.400
MATT: It's almost like a wizard's track suit.

02:04:32.010 --> 02:04:34.600
(all laugh)

02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:36.740
LIAM: You ruined it for me, man!

02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:38.680
TALIESIN: And it's dead.

02:04:39.850 --> 02:04:42.650
MARISHA: Please tell me it says "arcane" on the butt?

02:04:42.650 --> 02:04:43.160
MATT: No.

02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:45.000
(all laugh)

02:04:46.610 --> 02:04:47.890
MATT: He's very well-dressed,

02:04:47.890 --> 02:04:49.800
but his presentation is definitely a presentation.

02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:51.890
As the hand swishes open, he goes,

02:04:51.890 --> 02:04:53.890
GILMORE: "I'm sorry, was I being summoned?"

02:04:55.170 --> 02:04:55.890
ORION: Yes.

02:04:55.890 --> 02:04:57.890
MATT: He immediately looks and goes,

02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:00.500
GILMORE: "Oh. You've returned."

02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:04.840
VAX: Gilmore, you glorious bastard. How have you been?

02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:06.840
MATT: He immediately rushes to the edge and

02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:09.490
leans over the counter to give you a grandiose hug

02:05:09.490 --> 02:05:11.370
and actually lifts you off your feet.

02:05:11.370 --> 02:05:13.370
Much stronger than you anticipated. He goes,

02:05:13.370 --> 02:05:16.860
GILMORE: "Oh, Vax'ahlia. It's been far too long."

02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:19.160
MATT: He sets you down next to him behind the counter

02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:23.220
and gives you a big hug, his strong wizard arms around you.

02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:28.300
A scent of what's almost like fine herbs

02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:30.450
with a hint of patchouli enters your nose.

02:05:30.450 --> 02:05:31.010
TALIESIN: (laughs)

02:05:31.010 --> 02:05:33.010
VAX: You naughty man.

02:05:33.010 --> 02:05:35.220
You just called me by my sister's name.

02:05:35.220 --> 02:05:36.810
That is going to cost you.

02:05:36.810 --> 02:05:37.500
MARISHA: (gasps)

02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:41.100
GILMORE: "I said Vax! What do you mean?

02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:43.060
VAX: I heard "Vex'ahlia."
That's ridiculous. Preposterous."

02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:44.930
Can we go to the videotape? Anyone?

02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:46.700
MARISHA: Instant replay!

02:05:46.700 --> 02:05:48.700
TIBERIUS: Actually, Vax, he was correct.

02:05:48.700 --> 02:05:49.690
He said your name correctly.

02:05:49.690 --> 02:05:50.880
I believe you owe him a little something now.

02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:53.970
KEYLETH: I think it was a little bit of combination.

02:05:53.970 --> 02:05:56.140
A little bit of column A, a little bit of column B.

02:05:56.140 --> 02:05:58.140
I think he called you Vex'ahlia.

02:05:58.140 --> 02:05:59.080
VAX: Water under the bridge.

02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:01.100
KEYLETH: Or Vax'ahlia, is what he called you.

02:06:01.100 --> 02:06:03.640
TIBERIUS: He called you Vax'ahlia, which I call you in my sleep.

02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:04.530
VAX: Shut up, you.

02:06:05.570 --> 02:06:06.330
LIAM: I lean in.

02:06:06.330 --> 02:06:10.260
MATT: He looks genuinely perturbed and embarrassed

02:06:10.260 --> 02:06:11.240
by the whole circumstance.

02:06:11.860 --> 02:06:13.140
GILMORE: "I --"

02:06:13.140 --> 02:06:14.930
LIAM: I lean in. I pat him on the hand.

02:06:15.460 --> 02:06:20.560
VAX: Don't you worry. We have come from far and away.

02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:23.280
You would not believe the shit we have been through,

02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:24.720
but I don't want to talk about me.

02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:25.680
I want to talk about you.

02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:28.210
What has been going on in this city since we've been gone?

02:06:28.210 --> 02:06:28.990
GILMORE: "Well."

02:06:28.990 --> 02:06:30.890
MATT: And he looks about the rest of you and says,

02:06:30.890 --> 02:06:33.050
GILMORE: "Obviously you've brought the rest of your friends here.

02:06:33.050 --> 02:06:34.920
"Come, sit! Story time, story time!"

02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:35.960
(all laugh)

02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:36.890
GILMORE: "Please sit around."

02:06:37.730 --> 02:06:39.070
TIBERIUS: Fantastic.

02:06:40.670 --> 02:06:44.570
GILMORE: "We have been doing marvelously.

02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:46.690
"Trade has opened up wide in Emon.

02:06:46.690 --> 02:06:49.740
"We've had travelers from all over Tal'Dorei and beyond.

02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:51.870
"It's incredible."

02:06:52.330 --> 02:06:53.740
(all giggle)

02:06:54.730 --> 02:06:57.080
GILMORE: "I'm in the process of planning an expansion

02:06:57.080 --> 02:06:58.620
"to another town. Perhaps even --"

02:06:58.620 --> 02:06:59.380
VEX: Oh, my.

02:06:59.380 --> 02:07:06.190
GILMORE: "--perhaps even opening a second store in Westruun."

02:07:06.190 --> 02:07:08.960
KEYLETH: You're going to own a chain?

02:07:09.470 --> 02:07:10.750
TIBERIUS: Congratulations!
GILMORE: "Perhaps."

02:07:10.750 --> 02:07:12.750
TIBERIUS: This is a big step for any businessman.

02:07:12.750 --> 02:07:14.600
PERCY: Spectacular.

02:07:15.330 --> 02:07:16.980
GILMORE: "But yes. No, I have been able to take on

02:07:16.980 --> 02:07:18.520
"two more arcanists.

02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:20.260
"We've been in the process of

02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:23.610
"designing some more interesting, wondrous items.

02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:27.970
"We have stocked many of our recent

02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:30.190
"possible and available items.

02:07:30.190 --> 02:07:32.800
"We are doing quite well for ourselves."

02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:35.220
TIBERIUS: Are you looking for investors, Gilmore?

02:07:38.810 --> 02:07:42.530
GILMORE: "I technically am your investor, in a way."

02:07:42.530 --> 02:07:43.050
TIBERIUS: Oh.

02:07:43.050 --> 02:07:43.960
VEX: He is.

02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:46.030
KEYLETH: True, we are sponsored by him.

02:07:46.030 --> 02:07:47.650
GILMORE: "But. If you have the money in which

02:07:47.650 --> 02:07:50.770
"to sponsor our business, that's a whole other discussion."

02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:54.670
TIBERIUS: I just wanted you to talk to me for a little bit.

02:07:55.580 --> 02:07:56.300
Vax, take it away.

02:07:56.300 --> 02:07:58.730
GILMORE: "Dragonborn.

02:07:58.730 --> 02:08:00.510
"But yes! How about yourselves?

02:08:00.510 --> 02:08:02.860
"You look like you've --"

02:08:02.860 --> 02:08:04.740
MATT: He gives you all a look over.

02:08:05.310 --> 02:08:07.530
GILMORE: "--like you've maybe not slept in a fortnight."

02:08:07.530 --> 02:08:10.420
VAX: Well. We're lucky we're not dead.

02:08:10.420 --> 02:08:12.420
It came close a couple of times.

02:08:12.830 --> 02:08:15.700
We were off on official business for the emperor.

02:08:15.700 --> 02:08:18.130
We've been underground for weeks and weeks.

02:08:18.130 --> 02:08:20.280
We've only seen the sun for a couple of days.

02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:22.010
GILMORE: "Oh. That kind of a weekend.

02:08:22.010 --> 02:08:22.940
"I know how that goes."

02:08:22.940 --> 02:08:28.720
VAX: Needless to say, our stores are terribly depleted.

02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:31.460
We are going to need to stock up a bit

02:08:31.460 --> 02:08:33.100
before we head out of town again.

02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:34.460
I don't want to rush things, though.

02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:38.100
I think my friends probably want to shop about.

02:08:38.100 --> 02:08:40.910
My sister can probably handle things for me.

02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:43.940
I would love to take a stroll with you around the city.

02:08:45.580 --> 02:08:47.000
Get a bit of lunch, a bite,

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.640
and hear about what's been happening.

02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:51.360
Hear the rumors of town.

02:08:51.900 --> 02:08:55.870
We all know nobody matches your shrewdness in business.

02:08:55.870 --> 02:08:56.920
That's no surprise.

02:08:56.920 --> 02:08:57.900
GILMORE: (chuckles)

02:08:57.900 --> 02:08:59.570
VAX: But I'm wondering what you've heard.

02:08:59.570 --> 02:09:01.550
What's on the wind?

02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:03.610
Can you take the afternoon off?

02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:07.710
MATT: He looks over at the same half-elven woman

02:09:07.710 --> 02:09:08.850
who was trying to stop you earlier.

02:09:08.850 --> 02:09:11.970
She gives a look like, 'what's he going to say?'

02:09:11.970 --> 02:09:13.820
No one's ever asked him this question. He goes,

02:09:14.650 --> 02:09:16.810
GILMORE: "For you? Of course."

02:09:16.810 --> 02:09:19.260
(all laugh)

02:09:19.260 --> 02:09:21.230
MARISHA: Man date. Go for it!

02:09:21.230 --> 02:09:22.200
VEX: Don't worry, Gilmore.

02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:24.600
We'll take wonderful care of your employees.

02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:26.820
GILMORE: "Well if you wish to do business,

02:09:26.820 --> 02:09:27.880
"why not do that now?"

02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:31.170
VEX: We need to shop around first, of course.

02:09:31.170 --> 02:09:32.720
GILMORE: "Very well."

02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:33.740
PERCY: And we're so curious

02:09:33.740 --> 02:09:36.300
as to any of these interesting and fascinating things

02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:38.260
that you've developed in the several weeks

02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:39.700
it's been since we've been here.

02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:41.340
We'd love to see what you've been working on.

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:43.140
GILMORE: "Very well. Sherri!"

02:09:43.140 --> 02:09:45.860
MATT: The same woman, her shoulders droop.

02:09:46.350 --> 02:09:48.670
SHERRI: "Yes, Gilmore?"

02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:51.330
(all laugh)

02:09:51.330 --> 02:09:52.750
GILMORE: "Would you be so kind as to see to

02:09:52.750 --> 02:09:54.580
"whatever our friends need?

02:09:54.580 --> 02:09:56.200
"These are Vox Machina, by the way.

02:09:56.560 --> 02:09:59.450
"They are currently sponsored by Gilmore's Glorious Goods, Inc,

02:09:59.450 --> 02:10:01.950
"and I would very much like to make sure

02:10:01.950 --> 02:10:03.560
"that they are taken care of."

02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:07.760
SHERRI: "Yes, sir. I'll make sure that happens."

02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:10.600
MATT AND TALIESIN: (laugh)

02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:12.250
GILMORE: "So. Shall we?"

02:10:12.250 --> 02:10:14.320
VAX: I think this will take a while. Let's.

02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:16.750
VEX: Have a wonderful time, brother.

02:10:16.750 --> 02:10:18.460
LIAM: I look to my sister as we go.

02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:22.860
VAX: Just get what I need, will you?

02:10:23.300 --> 02:10:23.800
VEX: Of course.

02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:24.690
VAX: Thank you.

02:10:24.690 --> 02:10:26.160
LIAM: And stroll out the door with Gilmore.

02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:27.940
Have at it, ladies and gentlemen.

02:10:27.940 --> 02:10:28.940
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:10:28.940 --> 02:10:30.900
MARISHA: We'll leave dinner on the stove for you.

02:10:31.710 --> 02:10:33.880
MATT: So Sherri looks at the rest of you

02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:34.940
as they leave and goes,

02:10:37.690 --> 02:10:39.970
SHERRI: "So you're all friends of Gilmore, then?"

02:10:41.090 --> 02:10:41.860
KEYLETH: Yes.

02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:45.620
PIKE: Business friends.

02:10:46.210 --> 02:10:47.200
SHERRI: Business friends. All right.

02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:50.300
KEYLETH: We're mutual fans of one another, if you will.

02:10:50.300 --> 02:10:51.840
MATT: She adjusts her glasses.

02:10:52.530 --> 02:10:55.050
SHERRI: "Then let's continue with the business.

02:10:55.420 --> 02:10:57.140
"What are you seeking? What do you need?

02:10:57.140 --> 02:10:58.300
"What are you looking for?"

02:10:58.300 --> 02:11:00.300
TIBERIUS: I don't know. We like all kinds of things.

02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:01.900
KEYLETH: Well, we definitely need potions.

02:11:01.900 --> 02:11:03.080
SHERRI: "Potions. Those we can provide."

02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:03.890
KEYLETH: Health potions.

02:11:03.890 --> 02:11:04.660
SHERRI: "Health potions, yes.

02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:06.880
"Potions of healing can be provided."

02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:07.880
KEYLETH: What do you have right now?

02:11:08.350 --> 02:11:10.380
MATT: She goes behind the counter for a second

02:11:10.380 --> 02:11:12.000
and ruffles through some stuff.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:13.390
Goes in the back room and comes back out

02:11:13.390 --> 02:11:15.260
with a wooden crate, pretty much.

02:11:15.260 --> 02:11:17.090
You hear the glass jangling inside as she moves it

02:11:17.090 --> 02:11:19.090
and sets it on the counter with a ting.

02:11:19.090 --> 02:11:21.250
They all eventually come to rest. She goes,

02:11:21.250 --> 02:11:23.380
SHERRI: "All right, looking through here, it looks like we have

02:11:23.380 --> 02:11:25.640
"about 12 regular potions of healing.

02:11:26.220 --> 02:11:28.290
"We have six of greater healing.

02:11:29.020 --> 02:11:31.950
"And it looks like three of superior healing."

02:11:33.850 --> 02:11:33.890
PIKE: What's the price on the superior healing, again?

02:11:33.890 --> 02:11:34.850
TIBERIUS: We'll take the lot.
PIKE: What's the price on the superior healing, again?

02:11:34.850 --> 02:11:35.890
PIKE: What's the price on the superior healing, again?

02:11:35.890 --> 02:11:36.690
SHERRI: "Superior healing?

02:11:36.690 --> 02:11:40.770
"Let's see, currently those go for about --"

02:11:42.030 --> 02:11:43.980
MATT: She looks at the price book, going through.

02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:45.300
SHERRI: "Those will run you --"

02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:47.080
MATT: As I go through my price book.

02:11:49.610 --> 02:11:50.770
PIKE: We are sponsored.

02:11:51.630 --> 02:11:53.890
PERCY: We do keep getting turned to stone.

02:11:53.890 --> 02:11:55.770
This has been a problem, and it's

02:11:55.770 --> 02:11:56.660
been sticking around a bit.

02:11:56.660 --> 02:11:58.980
I feel like we should maybe take some precautions

02:11:58.980 --> 02:12:01.480
for the inevitable next time this happens.

02:12:02.690 --> 02:12:06.300
SHERRI: "That will be 1500 gold pieces per superior."

02:12:07.090 --> 02:12:10.140
KEYLETH: Is that with our sponsorship prices?

02:12:10.650 --> 02:12:12.440
SHERRI: "Right, you mentioned you're sponsored.

02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:14.530
"That would be a 10% discount.

02:12:14.530 --> 02:12:17.180
"That would bring it to about 1350,

02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:20.740
"should you wish to purchase them individually."

02:12:20.740 --> 02:12:21.580
PIKE: Okay.

02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:23.740
GROG: I definitely need one of those.

02:12:23.740 --> 02:12:26.670
VEX: Wait. How much if we're purchasing them individually?

02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:30.530
SHERRI: "1350 gold pieces per superior healing potion."

02:12:30.530 --> 02:12:31.340
TIBERIUS: How much for the lot?

02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:35.490
VEX: And if we buy in bulk, what can you bring it down to?

02:12:35.490 --> 02:12:36.650
SHERRI: "If you buy all three?"

02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:40.160
VEX: A thousand each?

02:12:42.110 --> 02:12:43.520
SHERRI: "I'm sorry.

02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:46.380
"You've already been given the discount via Gilmore.

02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:49.330
"That price stands as it is.

02:12:49.330 --> 02:12:52.410
"Let's say you buy the three remaining items,

02:12:52.410 --> 02:12:56.540
"I'll give you 1200 apiece.

02:12:56.540 --> 02:12:58.610
"And even that I'll probably get in trouble for,

02:12:58.610 --> 02:12:59.840
"but he seems to like you."

02:13:01.210 --> 02:13:03.900
VEX: 1200 apiece? Yes?

02:13:03.900 --> 02:13:04.940
GROG: We'll take that.

02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:05.410
PERCY: Sounds good.

02:13:05.410 --> 02:13:06.020
VEX: Three superior.

02:13:06.020 --> 02:13:06.970
SHERRI: "Very well.

02:13:07.810 --> 02:13:10.300
"So 3600 gold pieces.

02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:11.880
"Three superior are yours."

02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:13.090
MATT: She pulls them out of the crate

02:13:13.090 --> 02:13:13.820
and slides them across.

02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:17.320
They are thick, very heavily-made glass vials with these

02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:18.760
small glass handles on the side.

02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:20.270
You can see the interior.

02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:24.360
The liquid itself is a reddish purple, almost blood color,

02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:26.820
but there's a gold sheen as you shake it in the light.

02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:30.140
You can see there's a spark of divine glow to it.

02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:31.040
MARISHA: Like Goldschlager.

02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:31.530
TALIESIN: Classy.

02:13:31.530 --> 02:13:34.650
MATT: Kind of. It's the worst of healing Goldschlager.

02:13:34.650 --> 02:13:36.010
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:13:37.490 --> 02:13:38.900
SHERRI: "Is that all you require?"

02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:44.270
GROG: Do you sell any love potions?

02:13:44.970 --> 02:13:47.050
MATT: She gives you the blank stare and goes,

02:13:47.900 --> 02:13:48.500
SHERRI: "No."

02:13:48.500 --> 02:13:50.590
(all laugh)

02:13:51.020 --> 02:13:53.800
GROG: Right. Sorry for asking. Jeez.

02:13:54.210 --> 02:13:57.310
PERCY: I would also say we should take the

02:13:57.310 --> 02:13:59.500
six superior healing potions, as well.

02:13:59.500 --> 02:14:00.500
TIBERIUS: Absolutely.

02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:01.800
SHERRI: "The greater ones."

02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:02.490
PERCY: Greater.

02:14:02.490 --> 02:14:05.220
VEX: What did we just buy? We didn't buy superior?

02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:06.220
PERCY: We bought the three superior.

02:14:06.220 --> 02:14:07.710
We should also get the six greater.

02:14:08.580 --> 02:14:10.520
VEX: Six greater. All right. How much is that?

02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:12.170
SHERRI: "Those are 500 apiece.

02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:16.720
"With your discount, that would be 450 apiece."

02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:19.050
VEX: But if we're buying all six,

02:14:19.050 --> 02:14:21.380
400 apiece is a very good price.

02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:24.840
ORION: Now, this is the Vex I miss.
MATT: Roll a persuasion check.

02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:26.810
MARISHA, ORION, AND TALIESIN:  Persuasion check,

02:14:26.810 --> 02:14:27.640
persuasion check!

02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:30.010
LIAM: Vex hasn't had a chance to haggle

02:14:30.010 --> 02:14:31.290
since the show started.

02:14:31.290 --> 02:14:32.190
MARISHA: Yep.

02:14:32.190 --> 02:14:34.990
LIAM: All she used to do before this show was haggle.

02:14:34.990 --> 02:14:37.320
MARISHA: We used to take food breaks.

02:14:41.650 --> 02:14:42.830
MARISHA: No!

02:14:43.130 --> 02:14:44.180
LAURA: Fourteen.

02:14:44.510 --> 02:14:45.320
MATT: Fourteen? She goes,

02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:52.770
SHERRI: "Let's call it an even 425 gold pieces each."

02:14:52.770 --> 02:14:55.580
VEX: I like this. I'm comfortable with that.

02:14:55.580 --> 02:14:56.360
SHERRI: "All right."

02:14:56.360 --> 02:14:57.540
TALIESIN: 425 times 6...

02:14:57.540 --> 02:14:58.900
MATT: She brings out her arcane calculator.

02:14:59.470 --> 02:15:01.160
MARISHA: Her arcane calculator?

02:15:03.450 --> 02:15:04.350
Once again, our charity.

02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:06.650
SHERRI: "Thatâ€™ll be 2550 gold pieces."

02:15:06.770 --> 02:15:07.470
LAURA: All right.

02:15:07.470 --> 02:15:09.690
MATT: And she pulls out the six that are there

02:15:09.690 --> 02:15:11.220
and she kinda slides them over the counter to you.

02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:14.050
One tips over but she catches it,

02:15:14.050 --> 02:15:15.460
leaves it there at the far end.

02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:17.310
GROG: Careful with those.

02:15:17.310 --> 02:15:19.440
SHERRI: "Theyâ€™re fine, they can take a beating,

02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:20.320
"theyâ€™re designed that way."

02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:22.090
GROG: So can I.

02:15:22.650 --> 02:15:23.780
MATT: She pushes her glasses up

02:15:23.780 --> 02:15:26.450
and looks vastly unimpressed at the presentation.

02:15:28.570 --> 02:15:30.490
VEX: How much were the superiors again?

02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:32.830
SHERRI: "The superiors were 1500

02:15:32.830 --> 02:15:34.930
"brought down to 1200 apiece, yes."

02:15:34.930 --> 02:15:37.780
VEX: 1200. Which came to 36?

02:15:37.780 --> 02:15:38.460
PERCY: Thirty-six.

02:15:39.580 --> 02:15:40.920
PERCY: So do you have anything,

02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:42.140
we keep getting turned into stone,

02:15:42.140 --> 02:15:43.700
itâ€™s been sort of a running theme.

02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:46.400
We were hoping you might have something

02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:49.330
to help alleviate stone skin or any --

02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:53.730
SHERRI: "We do have potions of petrification removal."

02:15:53.730 --> 02:15:55.480
PERCY: Yes! Petrification removal.

02:15:55.480 --> 02:15:56.890
SHERRI: I think. Let me check.

02:15:56.890 --> 02:15:58.290
MATT: And she goes in the back room,

02:15:58.290 --> 02:15:59.490
rummages around for a minute,

02:15:59.490 --> 02:16:01.140
comes out and she presents two of them.

02:16:02.010 --> 02:16:06.510
They have a clear liquid that looks almost like dirty water,

02:16:07.180 --> 02:16:08.610
and theyâ€™re like thin little vials, she goes,

02:16:08.610 --> 02:16:12.690
SHERRI: "These potions, when applied to the flesh, will,

02:16:12.690 --> 02:16:14.560
"more of an oil I guess you would say,

02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:16.750
"removes the affliction of petrification.

02:16:17.530 --> 02:16:20.530
"These do cost 750 gold apiece."

02:16:21.810 --> 02:16:24.380
VEX: We have greater restoration from Pike,

02:16:24.380 --> 02:16:26.640
and she can cure --

02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:27.410
SHERRI: "Then youâ€™re fine."

02:16:27.410 --> 02:16:27.890
MATT: And she takes them --

02:16:27.890 --> 02:16:29.460
TIBERIUS: How many potions are there?

02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:29.780
SHERRI: "Two."

02:16:29.780 --> 02:16:30.430
LIAM: But in the heat of the moment.

02:16:30.430 --> 02:16:30.900
TIBERIUS: Get them.

02:16:30.900 --> 02:16:31.530
PERCY: In the heat of the moment,

02:16:31.530 --> 02:16:33.530
it might come quite in handy.

02:16:33.530 --> 02:16:35.530
LIAM: A stone Grog in the middle of a fight?

02:16:35.530 --> 02:16:36.440
GROG: I agree.

02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:38.030
TIBERIUS: It takes her a day to learn that

02:16:38.030 --> 02:16:39.770
and she can only do it like once or twice at the most.

02:16:39.770 --> 02:16:41.770
GROG: I think we need to get it.

02:16:41.770 --> 02:16:46.080
PERCY: Iâ€™d rather have the potions than the gold, to be fair.

02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:46.940
KEYLETH: Letâ€™s just get one.

02:16:46.940 --> 02:16:48.810
PERCY: And we havenâ€™t discussed our discount.

02:16:48.810 --> 02:16:50.100
KEYLETH: I should learn how to make potions.

02:16:50.100 --> 02:16:51.310
I should learn this.

02:16:52.210 --> 02:16:53.930
LIAM: Money is meant for spending.

02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:55.760
VEX: Do we want to take one?

02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:56.360
TIBERIUS: Take both.

02:16:56.360 --> 02:16:58.360
PERCY: Iâ€™d actually say we take both.

02:16:58.360 --> 02:16:59.150
LIAM: Not that Iâ€™m here.

02:16:59.150 --> 02:17:02.300
VEX: Take both. 750 was not the discounted price.

02:17:02.300 --> 02:17:02.980
TIBERIUS: No.

02:17:03.410 --> 02:17:05.880
MATT: She gives you another look of like, ugh.

02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:06.980
She adjusts her glasses.

02:17:06.980 --> 02:17:09.320
TIBERIUS: To be fair, we are spending a lot, right?

02:17:09.700 --> 02:17:10.330
Overall, so.

02:17:10.330 --> 02:17:11.060
PIKE: Overall.

02:17:12.520 --> 02:17:15.020
SHERRI: "That would come to 1350."

02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:16.980
PERCY: Thirteen fifty.

02:17:19.490 --> 02:17:20.930
GROG: Weâ€™ll take it.

02:17:22.410 --> 02:17:25.980
VEX: 1300. Remember, weâ€™re very good friends of Gilmoreâ€™s,

02:17:25.980 --> 02:17:27.120
he said to treat us well.

02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:28.340
MATT: Make another persuasion roll.

02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:33.310
This is my new fan dice.

02:17:33.310 --> 02:17:33.520
MATT: Itâ€™s awesome, thank you.

02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:35.260
LAURA: That was really good.
MATT: Itâ€™s awesome, thank you.

02:17:36.490 --> 02:17:38.290
LAURA: That would be 21.

02:17:40.370 --> 02:17:41.300
MATT: Itâ€™s a good thing.

02:17:42.170 --> 02:17:42.900
She gives you a look and goes,

02:17:44.810 --> 02:17:46.000
SHERRI: "I donâ€™t like you."

02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:50.400
(all laugh)

02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:52.280
SHERRI: "Thirteen hundred."

02:17:53.170 --> 02:17:55.820
VEX: Thirteen hundred, lovely, thank you.

02:17:56.340 --> 02:17:57.980
KEYLETH: Sherri? It was Sherri, right?

02:17:57.980 --> 02:17:58.940
SHERRI: "Yes?"

02:17:59.310 --> 02:18:03.740
KEYLETH: Do you have any books on how to learn

02:18:03.740 --> 02:18:06.320
how to start making your own potions?

02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:09.520
Or do you know of any classes in town

02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:13.310
where maybe I could sign up for like a potion workshop?

02:18:13.310 --> 02:18:15.250
SHERRI: "Nothing here, but thatâ€™s not a bad idea,

02:18:15.250 --> 02:18:17.250
"might run that past Gilmore."

02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:19.490
PERCY: You should offer a workshop.

02:18:19.490 --> 02:18:19.860
KEYLETH: You should absolutely offer a workshop.

02:18:19.860 --> 02:18:21.200
SHERRI: "Thatâ€™s a good idea,
KEYLETH: You should absolutely offer a workshop.

02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:23.140
"otherwise the Lyceum would be the place to look."

02:18:23.140 --> 02:18:23.980
KEYLETH: The Lyceum?

02:18:23.980 --> 02:18:24.350
SHERRI: "Yes."

02:18:24.350 --> 02:18:24.940
KEYLETH: Okay.

02:18:25.220 --> 02:18:27.210
TIBERIUS: Do you have any potions of strength

02:18:27.210 --> 02:18:29.210
or any ability potions?

02:18:29.210 --> 02:18:31.010
MATT: She leaves for a second, then comes back and goes,

02:18:31.010 --> 02:18:32.960
SHERRI: "No, Iâ€™m afraid those were all purchased.

02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:35.880
"However, we may have more in a few weeks or so.

02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:37.740
"They take some time to create

02:18:37.740 --> 02:18:39.680
"and the ingredients are a little bit scarce.

02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:40.730
"However, trade is opening, perhaps --"

02:18:40.730 --> 02:18:41.870
KEYLETH: Someone purchased

02:18:41.870 --> 02:18:43.950
all of your potion of strength potions?

02:18:43.950 --> 02:18:44.560
SHERRI: "Yes."

02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:47.120
KEYLETH: Oh. How many did you have?

02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:49.160
SHERRI: "We had four, I believe.

02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:51.220
"Varying giant strength types."

02:18:51.220 --> 02:18:52.260
PIKE: One person did

02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:53.920
or it was just a bunch of people just buying.

02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:55.450
SHERRI: "It was a handful over the period of time."

02:18:55.450 --> 02:18:56.170
KEYLETH: Oh.

02:18:57.260 --> 02:18:59.580
ORION: Iâ€™m gonna hand her also a ticket,

02:18:59.580 --> 02:19:02.300
a scroll of telescription and be like,

02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:05.010
TIBERIUS: When it comes in, please write that it has

02:19:05.010 --> 02:19:06.820
and I will be notified via this parchment.

02:19:06.820 --> 02:19:07.390
SHERRI: "Very well."

02:19:07.390 --> 02:19:08.050
MATT: She folds it

02:19:08.050 --> 02:19:10.540
and places it in a little cubby on the side.

02:19:10.540 --> 02:19:11.170
TIBERIUS: Thank you.

02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:12.670
SHERRI: "Is there anything else you require?

02:19:12.670 --> 02:19:15.120
"We have many magical,

02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:18.540
"various armaments and/or protective items."

02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:22.020
GROG: Armaments, what kind of armaments you got?

02:19:22.770 --> 02:19:24.130
SHERRI: "Well, if youâ€™ll follow me."

02:19:24.130 --> 02:19:28.000
MATT: She leads you up the stairway to the second floor.

02:19:28.210 --> 02:19:31.090
The second floor itself is just a series of glass cases

02:19:31.090 --> 02:19:32.410
that are leaned at an angle.

02:19:32.410 --> 02:19:35.010
In these cases you can see there are different

02:19:35.010 --> 02:19:37.790
items just laid out, small labels at the bottom with

02:19:37.790 --> 02:19:39.360
GROG: Oh.
a brief description of the enchantment.

02:19:39.800 --> 02:19:41.300
MATT: She leads you across, she goes,

02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:44.170
SHERRI: "Well, first weâ€™ll start here with the ring section."

02:19:44.170 --> 02:19:46.100
MATT: You can see thereâ€™s a small case that has

02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:48.440
along this purplish velvet pillow,

02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:49.860
a bunch of different rings set out. She goes,

02:19:49.860 --> 02:19:53.340
SHERRI: "We have varying degrees of rings of protection.

02:19:54.050 --> 02:19:55.490
"These rings are designed to protect

02:19:55.490 --> 02:19:56.200
"the individual who wears,

02:19:56.200 --> 02:19:58.010
"we have one I believe with the basic enchantment,

02:19:58.010 --> 02:20:00.010
"and one with one step higher above that."

02:20:00.360 --> 02:20:02.300
MATT: The equivalent of a ring of protection +2.

02:20:04.410 --> 02:20:06.320
SHERRI: "That ring runs 6500 gold.

02:20:08.860 --> 02:20:12.760
"We have a ring of psychic resistance that does

02:20:12.760 --> 02:20:15.960
"protect yourself from various mental intrusions.

02:20:18.110 --> 02:20:20.190
"We have a ring of evasion

"that can be utilized three times a day,

02:20:24.940 --> 02:20:27.560
"or one to three times a day.

"Should one of you not be quite quick enough

02:20:31.340 --> 02:20:33.580
"to avoid any sort of incoming danger.

02:20:33.580 --> 02:20:36.940
"You could allow yourself a successful escape.

02:20:38.190 --> 02:20:39.870
"That runs 4500.

02:20:40.660 --> 02:20:42.520
"We also have a ring of water walking.

02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:44.240
"This one has been popular in the past for

02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:47.710
"some various traveling troupes that wish to do

02:20:47.710 --> 02:20:49.710
"various performances that require

"defying the surface of water.

02:20:53.010 --> 02:20:54.680
"It gets a bit shifty now that I think about it,

"but you know, whatever folks will enjoy.

02:20:57.550 --> 02:20:59.050
"Peasantry is easily pleased.

02:21:00.220 --> 02:21:01.900
"So those are our rings at the moment.

02:21:01.900 --> 02:21:03.210
"Should any of those tickle your fancy,

02:21:03.210 --> 02:21:04.270
"please do let me know.

02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:06.170
"Here --"

02:21:06.170 --> 02:21:07.900
MATT: And she points over where there is

02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:11.720
a thick leather belt with like three straps across

02:21:11.720 --> 02:21:13.580
that looks highly well made with

02:21:13.580 --> 02:21:16.340
what looks like square runic carvings on the side.

02:21:16.730 --> 02:21:18.220
SHERRI: "--this is what is referred to,

02:21:18.220 --> 02:21:20.440
"and this was import from Kraghammer,

02:21:20.440 --> 02:21:22.200
"but weâ€™ve had it in here for quite some time,

02:21:22.200 --> 02:21:24.280
"a belt of dwarvenkind.

02:21:24.860 --> 02:21:26.090
"This belt, when adorned,

02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:29.570
"does increase the physical heartiness of the individual

02:21:30.040 --> 02:21:32.410
"as well as giving them

02:21:32.410 --> 02:21:34.880
"positive interaction with other dwarves.

02:21:36.450 --> 02:21:37.740
"And we havenâ€™t fully tested it yet,

02:21:37.740 --> 02:21:40.210
"but apparently it also seems to resist against

02:21:40.210 --> 02:21:42.700
"poison intrusion in oneâ€™s body,

02:21:42.700 --> 02:21:45.200
"allows you to see better in dark places,

02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:47.730
"and apparently grants you the ability of

02:21:47.730 --> 02:21:49.290
"speaking, reading, and writing Dwarvish."

02:21:49.940 --> 02:21:50.700
VEX: Oh wow.

02:21:50.700 --> 02:21:51.810
KEYLETH: I need that.

02:21:51.810 --> 02:21:52.660
MATT: It is 5000 gold.

02:21:52.660 --> 02:21:53.950
VEX: I bet thatâ€™s very expensive...

02:21:53.950 --> 02:21:55.060
LIAM: One month ago you needed that.

02:21:55.400 --> 02:21:56.660
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:21:58.010 --> 02:21:59.540
PIKE: What was the first ring?

02:22:01.060 --> 02:22:02.650
GROG: Ring of protection.
SHERRI: "The first ring was the ring of protection."

02:22:03.260 --> 02:22:04.380
MARISHA: Plus two, right?

02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:07.620
MATT: It gives a plus two bonus to AC and saving throws.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:09.260
MARISHA: Thatâ€™s really good.

02:22:09.780 --> 02:22:11.420
PIKE: What was the evasion one?

02:22:11.420 --> 02:22:13.310
SHERRI: "That one, thatâ€™s the ring of evasion."

02:22:13.310 --> 02:22:14.510
PIKE: Yes, what was that?

02:22:14.510 --> 02:22:15.610
MATT: It has three charges

02:22:15.610 --> 02:22:17.610
and it regains 1d3 charges per day.

02:22:18.010 --> 02:22:20.430
When you fail a dexterity saving throw while wearing it,

02:22:20.430 --> 02:22:22.590
you can use your reaction to expend a charge

02:22:22.590 --> 02:22:25.440
and auto-succeed on the saving throw instead.

02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:28.760
Good for people who have low dexterity.

02:22:31.140 --> 02:22:33.960
GROG: The one that protects you psychically,

02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:37.700
could you repeat that one on the menu, please?

02:22:37.700 --> 02:22:39.260
SHERRI: "The ring of psychic resistance --"

02:22:39.850 --> 02:22:40.690
TALIESIN: Oh god.

02:22:40.690 --> 02:22:42.280
MATT: It gives you resistance to psychic damage,

02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:44.540
so anyone does damage that is psychic-based,

02:22:44.540 --> 02:22:45.730
you take half damage.

02:22:46.750 --> 02:22:47.900
VEX: Thatâ€™s not quite it.

02:22:47.900 --> 02:22:49.010
GROG: Itâ€™s not good?

02:22:49.010 --> 02:22:50.620
VEX: No, itâ€™s not quite the same.

02:22:50.900 --> 02:22:52.210
GROG: Not even for me?

02:22:53.060 --> 02:22:54.840
VEX: Do you have anything to make Grog smarter?

02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:55.970
GROG: Well, fuck off.

02:22:56.400 --> 02:22:59.260
(all laugh)

02:23:02.130 --> 02:23:03.790
MATT: She looks over at him for a moment and goes,

02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:08.640
SHERRI: No. No we donâ€™t.

02:23:08.640 --> 02:23:11.260
VEX: Any crayons so he could be occupied?

02:23:12.460 --> 02:23:13.500
GROG: Do you have crayons?

02:23:14.660 --> 02:23:16.040
SHERRI: "We have colored writing implements

02:23:16.040 --> 02:23:17.330
"for children, if youâ€™d like."

02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:19.170
TIBERIUS: Yes, please.

02:23:19.170 --> 02:23:21.560
GROG: I saw a few children in town.

02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:22.880
Maybe they would like them.

02:23:23.810 --> 02:23:26.190
MATT: She goes back downstairs and comes back in a moment.

02:23:26.190 --> 02:23:28.740
She presents two small boxes that contain

02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:31.710
small colored wax things. You can see on the outside

02:23:31.710 --> 02:23:33.600
it has a picture of Gilmore, and heâ€™s doing this,

02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:35.640
and it says Gilmoreâ€™s Glorious Colored Sticks.

02:23:36.090 --> 02:23:37.340
ORION: Of course.

02:23:39.640 --> 02:23:42.380
SHERRI: "These are usually reserved for the children of

02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:46.250
"our customers, so if the children will enjoy it, enjoy."

02:23:46.250 --> 02:23:49.320
GROG: Iâ€™ll take one of those, please.

02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:50.420
KEYLETH: Yes, trust me --

02:23:50.420 --> 02:23:51.530
GROG: The colors are quite nice.

02:23:51.530 --> 02:23:52.730
KEYLETH: --the children will.

02:23:52.730 --> 02:23:54.270
SHERRI: "Five gold pieces apiece."

02:23:55.240 --> 02:23:57.930
KEYLETH: Five gold pieces apiece? I thought they were free,

02:23:57.930 --> 02:24:00.670
like when you go to an Oâ€™Charleyâ€™s or an Applebeeâ€™s.

02:24:00.670 --> 02:24:02.140
SHERRI: "Whatâ€™s an Applebeeâ€™s?"

02:24:02.580 --> 02:24:03.720
TIBERIUS: Itâ€™s a hellhole,

02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:05.980
apparently near where you used to live.

02:24:05.980 --> 02:24:08.640
MATT: Itâ€™s one of the layers of the Abyss,

02:24:08.640 --> 02:24:09.200
itâ€™s like around --

02:24:09.650 --> 02:24:11.330
KEYLETH: One of the infernal layers of the Abyss.

02:24:11.330 --> 02:24:12.720
MATT: About layer 943.

02:24:12.720 --> 02:24:14.530
KEYLETH: Itâ€™s getting pretty low, yeah.

02:24:14.530 --> 02:24:17.780
PIKE: So Iâ€™ve been talking with Scanlan

02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:24.590
and I know he was interested in the plus two AC ring.

02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:27.140
KEYLETH: I think we should pick that up for sure.

02:24:27.140 --> 02:24:28.320
PIKE: Whatâ€™s the price on that?

02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:30.960
SHERRI: "Sixty five hundredd gold pieces for that."

02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:31.480
PIKE: Okay.

02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:34.220
SHERRI: "With your discount, that would bring it --"

02:24:34.220 --> 02:24:37.120
MATT: Goes back and looks again at her magic calculator,

02:24:38.140 --> 02:24:38.700
Iâ€™m an actor not --

02:24:38.700 --> 02:24:39.580
LIAM: Itâ€™s an abacus.

02:24:39.580 --> 02:24:40.480
MATT: Exactly.

02:24:41.330 --> 02:24:43.740
SHERRI: "That brings it to 5850."

02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:49.330
PIKE: Well, he does have this amazing ruby gem.

02:24:50.490 --> 02:24:54.900
He was maybe thinking of trading that

02:24:54.900 --> 02:24:57.240
for maybe bringing down the price?

02:24:58.300 --> 02:25:00.040
MATT: Do we know how much that was worth?

02:25:01.220 --> 02:25:02.080
LIAM: Uh.

02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:03.240
MATT: Has Scanlan looked at his sheet

02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:04.700
and found what itâ€™s worth?

02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:06.110
VAX: Scanlan? Speak up,

02:25:06.110 --> 02:25:07.450
PIKE: Scanlan,
VAX: Scanlan? Speak up,

02:25:07.450 --> 02:25:09.330
VAX: Do you know how much itâ€™s worth?

02:25:09.330 --> 02:25:10.820
VAX: I think you wrote it down.

02:25:12.190 --> 02:25:13.580
Heâ€™s talking quietly.

02:25:13.580 --> 02:25:15.260
MATT: There was the diamond also that was

02:25:15.260 --> 02:25:16.830
repaired in the mending wheel.

02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:19.640
MATT: He can look that up as well.
MARISHA: There was a diamond.

02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:20.520
VAX: Vex, do you remember

02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:22.920
how much that diamond was worth, we got that diamond --

02:25:23.370 --> 02:25:24.430
MATT: Oh no, we lost them.

02:25:24.430 --> 02:25:25.320
TALIESIN: We lost them.

02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:25.950
MARISHA: Oh no!

02:25:25.950 --> 02:25:27.450
MATT: Redial, redial!

02:25:28.580 --> 02:25:29.610
MARISHA: This is important!

02:25:29.610 --> 02:25:30.130
LIAM: I got it.

02:25:30.130 --> 02:25:31.800
MARISHA: How much is the diamond worth?

02:25:32.590 --> 02:25:33.690
SHERRI: "Regardless.

02:25:34.650 --> 02:25:35.970
"Other things of interest,

02:25:35.970 --> 02:25:37.560
"nothing that would make him smarter,

02:25:38.430 --> 02:25:39.420
"that would make him quicker."

02:25:39.420 --> 02:25:40.590
LIAM: This is so period.

02:25:41.710 --> 02:25:44.750
Itâ€™s just like Lord of the Rings. Beep beep beep.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:47.660
MATT: Magical sending stone.

02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:50.100
LIAM: God damn it!

02:25:50.380 --> 02:25:51.300
MARISHA: Answer!

02:25:51.300 --> 02:25:52.250
MATT: Answer your Facetime.

02:25:52.250 --> 02:25:53.410
MARISHA: Answer, bitches.

02:25:53.860 --> 02:25:54.680
MATT: Vex!

02:25:54.680 --> 02:25:56.120
ORION: I hate when you call and you know

02:25:56.120 --> 02:25:57.640
that theyâ€™re there and they donâ€™t pick up.

02:25:57.640 --> 02:25:58.730
LIAM: All right, well Iâ€™m not here anyway,

02:25:58.730 --> 02:26:00.600
so Iâ€™m just gonna keep doing this, as you were.

02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:01.570
MATT: Weâ€™ll come to it.
so Iâ€™m just gonna keep doing this, as you were.

02:26:01.570 --> 02:26:02.420
SHERRI: "Regardless."

02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:03.790
MARISHA: We know youâ€™re there!

02:26:03.790 --> 02:26:05.290
MATT: She continues on, showing you through, she goes,

02:26:05.290 --> 02:26:06.100
SHERRI: "Well, I donâ€™t necessarily have anything

02:26:06.100 --> 02:26:07.630
"that would make him smarter.

02:26:08.380 --> 02:26:10.780
"We do have something that would make anyone quicker."

02:26:10.780 --> 02:26:13.300
MATT: She goes a second, there is a big, thick leather tome.

02:26:13.610 --> 02:26:15.840
SHERRI: "This is an ancient tome that was enchanted

02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:18.570
"many, many generations back.

02:26:18.850 --> 02:26:21.650
"Upon properly reading and studying this tome,

02:26:21.650 --> 02:26:25.160
"one would increase their physical dexterity permanently."

02:26:25.500 --> 02:26:28.060
KEYLETH: Oh, I like that.

02:26:28.060 --> 02:26:30.540
SHERRI: "It only has its abilities and power once a century,

02:26:30.540 --> 02:26:33.020
"so it does come quite pricey."

02:26:33.020 --> 02:26:34.740
KEYLETH: What is that price?

02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:36.350
SHERRI: "Fifteen hundred gold pieces."

02:26:38.780 --> 02:26:40.270
MARISHA: We should buy that.

02:26:40.270 --> 02:26:41.930
ASHLEY: We should probably buy it.

02:26:41.930 --> 02:26:43.760
KEYLETH: A tome that increases your dexterity plus one.

02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:45.980
LAURA: Itâ€™s on my phone now. We switched.

02:26:45.980 --> 02:26:46.860
MATT: Thatâ€™s okay.

02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:52.660
SHERRI: "So there is the manual of quickness of action,

02:26:52.660 --> 02:26:54.330
"we also have the hat of disguise --"

02:26:54.330 --> 02:26:54.680
MATT: And she produces this like --

02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:55.970
(Facetime noises)
MATT: And she produces this like --

02:26:58.250 --> 02:27:01.230
MATT: She produces this fine brass cap

02:27:01.230 --> 02:27:05.330
that has intricate swirling runes on it and what looks like

02:27:05.330 --> 02:27:08.450
a small set of ears that are pushed on the sides

02:27:08.450 --> 02:27:09.630
so when it fits on the head it looks almost like a

02:27:09.630 --> 02:27:12.660
smaller head on top of yours. She says,

02:27:12.660 --> 02:27:13.720
SHERRI: "This cap when worn, however,

02:27:13.720 --> 02:27:16.760
"one can alter their appearance however they see fit.

02:27:17.900 --> 02:27:18.590
"We also have --"

02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:22.510
MATT: She pulls out this thick, leather armor that has a

02:27:22.510 --> 02:27:24.940
brownish-blue trimmed hue to it and goes,

02:27:24.940 --> 02:27:27.400
SHERRI: "This is what we refer to as coldsnap leather armor.

02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:30.930
"It has an enchantment to improve oneâ€™s armor class by two.

02:27:30.930 --> 02:27:33.610
"While wearing it, you have resistance to cold damage."

02:27:34.270 --> 02:27:35.240
KEYLETH: Is it leather armor, you said?

02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:36.330
SHERRI: "Leather armor, yes."

02:27:36.330 --> 02:27:37.230
KEYLETH: How much is that?

02:27:37.230 --> 02:27:39.200
SHERRI: "That is 7500 gold pieces.

02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:43.800
"We also have the cape of Mountebank.

02:27:44.410 --> 02:27:46.930
"It is a cape that when triggered --"

02:27:46.930 --> 02:27:49.040
MATT: She takes it and shifts it for a second,

02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:50.880
you can see a little bit of smoke plumes off of it,

02:27:51.620 --> 02:27:52.380
smells sulfurish. She goes,

02:27:52.380 --> 02:27:54.690
SHERRI: "While wearing it, you can use it to teleport yourself

02:27:54.690 --> 02:27:56.960
"a short distance instantaneously, once per day.

02:27:59.020 --> 02:27:59.630
"We have this --"

02:27:59.630 --> 02:28:01.370
MATT: She pulls another dark cloak off the wall.

02:28:01.370 --> 02:28:04.480
This one looks like itâ€™s made of dark fur,

02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:06.410
but as she shakes it you can see these two little

02:28:06.410 --> 02:28:09.130
tendrils are on it. They like wiggle about,

02:28:09.130 --> 02:28:12.120
these little spiked edges to the tendrils.

02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:14.120
SHERRI: "This is a cloak of displacement,

02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:16.590
"enchanted and taken from the body of a displacer beast.

02:28:16.590 --> 02:28:17.540
"While wearing it,

02:28:17.540 --> 02:28:19.530
"it makes it so your body projects an illusion.

02:28:19.530 --> 02:28:22.820
"Anyone attempting to cause you harm has difficulty

02:28:22.820 --> 02:28:24.860
"actually finding purchase on your physical form,

02:28:24.860 --> 02:28:26.480
"not knowing where you truly stand."

02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:27.730
TIBERIUS: I will take that cape.

02:28:27.730 --> 02:28:28.960
SHERRI: "It is 4500 gold pieces."

02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:31.120
TIBERIUS: Wonderful. Vex?

02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:33.490
ORION: Oh, shit. Sheâ€™s not here.

02:28:33.490 --> 02:28:36.040
SHERRI: "Iâ€™ll put this aside as a possibility.

02:28:37.490 --> 02:28:38.890
"We have a pearl of power."

02:28:40.660 --> 02:28:42.460
MATT: She pulls up from this small box,

02:28:42.460 --> 02:28:43.490
she opens up the top lid.

02:28:43.490 --> 02:28:44.990
SHERRI: "This enchanted pearl,

02:28:45.550 --> 02:28:48.530
"you can use it to speak a command word

02:28:48.530 --> 02:28:50.830
"and regain one expended spell slot,

02:28:50.830 --> 02:28:53.870
"up to third level, that youâ€™ve already used.

02:28:53.870 --> 02:28:54.770
"Once youâ€™ve used the pearl,

02:28:54.770 --> 02:28:56.050
"it canâ€™t be used until the next dawn,

02:28:56.050 --> 02:28:58.220
"so once per day you can just return.

02:28:58.220 --> 02:28:59.560
"Itâ€™s for your caster-types."

02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:00.760
KEYLETH: A third-level spell?

02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:01.790
SHERRI: "Yes, up to third level,

02:29:01.790 --> 02:29:03.450
"one spell slot, you can immediately restore it.

02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:06.410
"It does require attunement, however,

02:29:06.410 --> 02:29:08.190
"and you canâ€™t have more than three items attuned to you,

02:29:08.190 --> 02:29:09.710
"so be aware of your limitations."

02:29:09.710 --> 02:29:10.750
PIKE: Whatâ€™s the price on that one?

02:29:10.750 --> 02:29:13.070
SHERRI: "This is 550 gold pieces."

02:29:13.070 --> 02:29:13.570
PIKE: Okay.

02:29:14.200 --> 02:29:17.920
TIBERIUS: Pike, do you have any 3rd-level healing spells?

02:29:18.780 --> 02:29:20.970
PIKE: Do I have 3rd-level healing spells? I do.

02:29:21.230 --> 02:29:24.340
SHERRI: "Weâ€™ll put it aside as a possibility. I also have --"

02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:25.470
MATT: And you move to the side,

02:29:25.470 --> 02:29:27.250
going through the armor section as well, she goes --

02:29:27.250 --> 02:29:29.870
SHERRI: "I have a mithral chain shirt,

02:29:29.870 --> 02:29:31.730
"as well as an enchanted mithral chain shirt,

02:29:31.730 --> 02:29:33.730
"there is a plus one enchantment on it as well.

02:29:33.730 --> 02:29:36.820
"They are flexible and can be worn under normal clothing,

02:29:37.210 --> 02:29:39.780
"does not impose disadvantage on dexterity or stealth checks.

02:29:41.060 --> 02:29:42.280
"It is considered light armor.

02:29:44.220 --> 02:29:48.450
"There is golden chainmail, itâ€™s a plus one enchantment."

02:29:49.570 --> 02:29:52.760
MATT: Then she goes to what looks to be a series of weapons.

02:29:54.810 --> 02:29:58.000
She brings forth a very fine-looking dagger, that has --

02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:59.500
LIAM: Everyone hears from the back,

02:29:59.500 --> 02:30:02.620
Scanlanâ€™s voice piping up saying, "Just buy all this shit!"

02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:04.760
MARISHA: Just buy all this shit.

02:30:05.140 --> 02:30:05.720
ASHLEY: Buy everything.

02:30:05.720 --> 02:30:07.720
MARISHA: How much money did we have?

02:30:08.110 --> 02:30:09.090
Didnâ€™t we have like at least --

02:30:09.090 --> 02:30:11.480
LIAM: Thirty... thirty-ish. I mean, Iâ€™m not here, but --

02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:12.450
MATT: And you still have money you havenâ€™t

02:30:12.450 --> 02:30:14.850
collected in Kraghammer, too.

02:30:14.850 --> 02:30:15.390
MARISHA: Huh?

02:30:15.390 --> 02:30:17.170
MATT: Thereâ€™s money you still havenâ€™t collected in Kraghammer.

02:30:19.120 --> 02:30:20.940
Lord Nostoc Greyspine, you guys made a deal with him

02:30:20.940 --> 02:30:22.440
before you went down in the pits.

02:30:22.440 --> 02:30:23.710
LIAM: So maybe we could open up a line --

02:30:23.710 --> 02:30:25.790
Iâ€™m sure you guys could open up a line of credit

02:30:25.790 --> 02:30:26.930
with my buddy Gilmore.

02:30:29.330 --> 02:30:30.380
MARISHA: A line of credit?

02:30:31.490 --> 02:30:32.990
LIAM: Yeah, an I.O.U.

02:30:34.660 --> 02:30:36.940
Once weâ€™re back from our day.

02:30:38.110 --> 02:30:40.010
MARISHA: So weâ€™ve got like roughly 30k?

02:30:40.380 --> 02:30:42.980
LIAM: In our possession now. Thirty-one.

02:30:42.980 --> 02:30:43.960
ORION: We have over that.

02:30:43.960 --> 02:30:47.660
Because Vex and Grog are with us. And they have --

02:30:50.240 --> 02:30:51.320
MATT: She has all the money.

02:30:51.320 --> 02:30:52.530
So weâ€™ll just keep track of what you guys spend

02:30:52.530 --> 02:30:54.830
and bring it back to Vex, your treasurer.

02:30:54.830 --> 02:30:55.870
And sheâ€™ll be really angry

02:30:55.870 --> 02:30:56.910
that you guys spent all that money.

02:30:56.910 --> 02:30:57.300
LIAM: Sheâ€™s trying, sheâ€™s trying,

02:30:57.300 --> 02:30:58.080
itâ€™s coming up on my phone.

02:30:58.080 --> 02:31:00.170
ORION: The trick is, we donâ€™t know how much the total is.

02:31:00.170 --> 02:31:03.970
MARISHA: We generally would if our partyâ€™s here.

02:31:03.970 --> 02:31:06.860
She just canâ€™t tell us at this moment.

02:31:07.240 --> 02:31:08.200
ORION: Itâ€™s well over thirty.

02:31:08.200 --> 02:31:09.790
I think we have closer to fifty.

02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:11.900
... maybe forty.

02:31:12.460 --> 02:31:13.690
MATT: So she presents this dagger to you guys --

02:31:13.690 --> 02:31:14.120
MARISHA: We donâ€™t want to deplete all of our funds.
MATT: So she presents this dagger to you guys --

02:31:14.120 --> 02:31:16.090
SHERRI: "This is a fine dagger,
MARISHA: We donâ€™t want to deplete all of our funds.

SHERRI: "This is a fine dagger,

"the blood runs themselves are enchanted --"

02:31:16.780 --> 02:31:18.730
MARISHA: We also spent a lot on the keep,
"the blood runs themselves are enchanted --"

02:31:18.730 --> 02:31:21.630
donâ€™t forget that, we dumped a lot of money into the keep.

02:31:21.630 --> 02:31:22.850
MATT: Yep, you did.

02:31:22.850 --> 02:31:25.680
MARISHA: So we might have more like thirty.

02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:28.290
MATT: You guys spent quite a bit on the keep.

02:31:28.650 --> 02:31:29.330
All right.

02:31:29.630 --> 02:31:31.140
PIKE: Whatâ€™s this dagger?

02:31:31.140 --> 02:31:34.130
SHERRI: "This dagger actually can take the lifeforce

02:31:34.130 --> 02:31:36.830
"from an enemy when delivering a very strong blow."

02:31:36.830 --> 02:31:39.540
MATT: Essentially, on a critical hit on the attack roll --

02:31:39.540 --> 02:31:40.120
(all cheer)

02:31:40.120 --> 02:31:40.860
ASHLEY: We got it.
(all cheer)

02:31:40.860 --> 02:31:41.540
ORION: Here they are.
(all cheer)

02:31:43.360 --> 02:31:45.020
MARISHA: How much money do we have?

02:31:45.580 --> 02:31:47.730
LAURA: We have --hold on, let me look.

02:31:47.730 --> 02:31:49.370
TRAVIS: Twenty-four thousand --

02:31:50.050 --> 02:31:51.770
LAURA: No. I normally donâ€™t,

02:31:52.940 --> 02:31:55.800
LAURA: We have about 20,000, all right?

02:31:55.800 --> 02:31:57.960
ORION: So we have 50,000 total.

02:32:00.250 --> 02:32:03.050
Because we just had 30, we just got paid 30 grand, right?

02:32:03.050 --> 02:32:03.970
MATT: Yeah, ten.
MARISHA: No.

02:32:03.970 --> 02:32:05.290
MARISHA: Ten grand.

02:32:05.290 --> 02:32:06.920
MATT: You got ten grand from Allura

02:32:06.920 --> 02:32:08.250
and you currently have a floating --

02:32:08.250 --> 02:32:09.820
MARISHA: And she added that.

02:32:09.820 --> 02:32:10.370
ORION: Thatâ€™s added?

02:32:10.370 --> 02:32:13.050
LAURA: I already added that, weâ€™re at 20,000.

02:32:13.050 --> 02:32:14.880
ORION: I thought we were at 30 --

02:32:14.880 --> 02:32:17.520
MARISHA: We spent almost 50,000 dollars on our keep.

02:32:17.520 --> 02:32:18.650
ORION: Right, but --

02:32:18.990 --> 02:32:21.760
TRAVIS: Plus those fucks in Kraghammer owe us a fortune.

02:32:21.760 --> 02:32:22.430
LAURA: Yeah.

02:32:22.430 --> 02:32:25.090
MATT: Yeah, 25,000 gold is still owed by

02:32:25.090 --> 02:32:25.920
Lord Nostoc Greyspine.

02:32:25.920 --> 02:32:27.200
ORION: Thatâ€™s who owed us.

02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:29.200
MARISHA: Yes, thatâ€™s what weâ€™re saying.

02:32:29.200 --> 02:32:29.630
ORION: What?

02:32:29.630 --> 02:32:31.860
MARISHA: Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re saying we only have 20 or 30 --

02:32:31.860 --> 02:32:34.840
TALIESIN: No, we havenâ€™t gone back there.

02:32:34.840 --> 02:32:36.110
ORION: So weâ€™ll have to go back and get it.

02:32:36.110 --> 02:32:37.010
TALIESIN: Eventually, yeah.

02:32:37.710 --> 02:32:38.970
SHERRI: "So while you --"

02:32:38.970 --> 02:32:41.060
LAURA: Will you point us a little bit out so we can see --

02:32:41.900 --> 02:32:44.280
SHERRI: "As I was saying, this dagger,

02:32:44.280 --> 02:32:47.600
"upon a very impactful wound on a foe,

02:32:47.600 --> 02:32:48.900
"steals a bit of its life force,

"dealing an additional ten necrotic damage,

"and then gives the wielder ten temporary hitpoints."

02:32:54.970 --> 02:32:56.130
VEX: Whoa, thatâ€™s major.

02:32:56.520 --> 02:32:57.390
SHERRI: "So thereâ€™s that.

02:32:57.390 --> 02:33:00.560
"We also have an enchanted heavy maul,

"and we have --this is quite a find here."

02:33:03.640 --> 02:33:06.280
MATT: As she pulls out this wooden case,

02:33:06.280 --> 02:33:09.470
she pulls back the wooden top to it. As she does,

02:33:09.470 --> 02:33:10.830
you can see thereâ€™s a little bit of ice crystal

02:33:10.830 --> 02:33:13.090
thatâ€™s gathered along the interior of the wooden case.

02:33:13.610 --> 02:33:15.330
There inside sits a short sword,

02:33:15.330 --> 02:33:17.570
a relatively thick short blade,

02:33:17.570 --> 02:33:20.050
but the blade itself is like a blue,

02:33:20.050 --> 02:33:22.120
almost glimmering metal, and thereâ€™s

02:33:22.120 --> 02:33:25.800
actually a rising frozen mist that drifts off the blade.

02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:29.220
SHERRI: "This is an enchanted frostbrand.

02:33:29.220 --> 02:33:30.660
"It acts as a shortsword.

"Whenever it does damage to an enemy,

"it does an additional 1d6 cold damage.

"And while you hold the weapon

"you have resistance to any fire damage you would take.

"At freezing temperatures, it sheds

"a ten foot radius of dim light,

"and when you draw the weapon,

"you extinguish all magical flames within 30 feet of you."

02:33:51.320 --> 02:33:51.980
PERCY: Fancy.

02:33:53.180 --> 02:33:54.960
SHERRI: "And those are currently

02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:56.800
"all the things we have at the moment.

"Magical creations."

PIKE: I have a question.

02:34:07.300 --> 02:34:07.580
SHERRI: "Yes."

02:34:07.580 --> 02:34:10.450
PIKE: Do you have anything that can make armor...

02:34:10.450 --> 02:34:11.560
... quieter?

02:34:11.820 --> 02:34:13.610
(all laugh)

02:34:14.090 --> 02:34:19.010
PIKE: Maybe like a really heavy armor, thatâ€™s really quiet.

02:34:19.010 --> 02:34:20.540
LIAM: That oil from the Wizard of Oz.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:23.730
SHERRI: "We donâ€™t have anything for that,

02:34:23.730 --> 02:34:27.470
"but we could have it commissioned for you if youâ€™d like."

02:34:27.470 --> 02:34:29.650
PIKE: I would like to see about that.

02:34:30.850 --> 02:34:32.580
SHERRI: "All right. Iâ€™ll have to talk to Gilmore.

02:34:32.580 --> 02:34:34.400
"Thatâ€™s more in his realm of enchantment,

02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:35.620
"but that is a possibility."

02:34:37.210 --> 02:34:38.460
MATT: She adjusts her glasses again.

02:34:39.210 --> 02:34:40.650
SHERRI: "When he returns, whenever that is,

02:34:41.900 --> 02:34:44.260
"we can discuss with him what youâ€™d like, yes."

02:34:44.260 --> 02:34:45.280
PIKE: That would be great.

02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:46.260
SHERRI: "All right, well."

02:34:46.260 --> 02:34:47.130
PIKE: Thank you.
TIBERIUS: I will take the enchanted mithral shirt

02:34:47.130 --> 02:34:48.210
TIBERIUS: I will take the enchanted mithral shirt

02:34:48.210 --> 02:34:50.210
and the cape, thank you very much.

02:34:50.210 --> 02:34:51.090
SHERRI: "All right."

02:34:51.090 --> 02:34:52.520
MATT: And she grabs the --

02:34:54.530 --> 02:34:55.500
TIBERIUS: But thatâ€™s not the total yet.

02:34:55.500 --> 02:34:58.010
Vex has to talk about the rest of what we want.

02:34:58.010 --> 02:35:00.510
PIKE: Whatâ€™s the price on the dagger and the sword?

02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:05.470
SHERRI: "The sword is 8500 gold pieces.

ORION: Wait, I canâ€™t --

SHERRI: "What do you have to trade?"

GROG: Weâ€™ve got lots of bits from dragons,

02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:37.940
lots of bits from umber hulks,

02:35:37.940 --> 02:35:39.940
and weâ€™ve got basilisk eggs.

02:35:40.350 --> 02:35:42.810
KEYLETH: We also have that diamond and the ruby.

02:35:42.810 --> 02:35:43.420
Do we know how much that is?

02:35:43.420 --> 02:35:43.970
TIBERIUS: Yes.
Do we know how much that is?

02:35:43.970 --> 02:35:45.390
VEX: We also have some jewels.

02:35:46.910 --> 02:35:49.310
KEYLETH: I definitely say we pick up that ring

02:35:49.310 --> 02:35:52.170
with the AC and I wouldnâ€™t mind having that leather --

02:35:52.170 --> 02:35:53.020
VEX: The ring of protection?

02:35:53.020 --> 02:35:54.600
KEYLETH: That ring of protection that gives

02:35:54.600 --> 02:35:55.920
you plus two to your AC.

02:35:56.910 --> 02:35:58.810
That we need for somebody.

02:35:58.810 --> 02:36:00.770
And I wouldnâ€™t mind having that leather armor.

02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:05.310
That adds a plus two to my AC.

02:36:05.310 --> 02:36:06.280
SHERRI: "Cold snap?"

02:36:06.280 --> 02:36:07.120
MARISHA: Yup.

SHERRI: "All right."

MARISHA: I want new stuff.

02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:51.450
I havenâ€™t gotten new armor since we started.

ORION: You should get the mithral shirt,

02:36:55.760 --> 02:36:56.700
it adds something to your --

02:37:00.340 --> 02:37:02.120
MARISHA: Do you wear light armor or medium armor?

02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:04.000
TALIESIN: I would guess light armor, I imagine.

She takes a few and she takes her glasses off

this intricate-looking, multi-lensed tinkering viewing device

"A pound, you say?"

VEX: How much is a pound worth to you?

02:38:18.110 --> 02:38:19.360
GROG: We have several pounds.
VEX: And Iâ€™ll tell you how much we have.

02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:20.740
VEX: And Iâ€™ll tell you how much we have.

SHERRI: "Say a pound of dragon scales --"

02:38:22.900 --> 02:38:24.400
MATT: And the dragon scales themselves are about

02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:27.500
that big each, theyâ€™re about the size of a peach.

02:38:28.110 --> 02:38:29.000
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

02:38:30.100 --> 02:38:32.290
MATT: Dragons are big, especially this one.

02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:37.390
SHERRI: "Blue dragon scales, Iâ€™d say a pound is maybe,

02:38:38.460 --> 02:38:43.120

LAURA: Yeah.

02:38:53.080 --> 02:38:54.010
ORION: Perfect.

02:38:54.010 --> 02:38:57.610
VEX: So thatâ€™s another, at least, what? Eleven thousand?

02:38:57.610 --> 02:38:59.780
LIAM: Five hundred thousand gold right there.

02:39:00.170 --> 02:39:03.050
VEX: Thatâ€™s like another 10,000 we have in dragon scales.

02:39:03.050 --> 02:39:06.650
GROG: We have 11 pounds of dragon scales.

02:39:06.650 --> 02:39:08.240
KEYLETH: And how about that diamond

02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:09.500
that we put in the mending wheel?

02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:10.420
ORION: No, ruby.

02:39:10.420 --> 02:39:15.080
VEX: Itâ€™s flawless and beautiful and so sparkly.

02:39:15.790 --> 02:39:16.910
KEYLETH: How much?

02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:19.090
MATT: Pulls that again, looks over it.

02:39:19.850 --> 02:39:20.500
KEYLETH: Catch.

02:39:20.980 --> 02:39:23.460

02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:29.180
GROG: We also have three dragon teeth,

fangs from the beastâ€™s mouth.

ORION: Oh no, they --

02:39:40.660 --> 02:39:41.810
MARISHA: Oh no, they didnâ€™t!

02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:43.970
LIAM: Iâ€™m gonna tell them. Oh my gosh.

02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:47.640
MARISHA: Persuasion roll. Oh no!

02:39:47.880 --> 02:39:50.770
LIAM: You have to make a persuasion roll, quick.

02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:52.970
TALIESIN: Thatâ€™s hilarious.

02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:55.450
MATT: Timing is everything, folks. Timing is everything.

02:39:55.450 --> 02:39:56.360
TALIESIN: Timing is everything.

02:39:56.360 --> 02:39:58.890
PIKE: I have one dragon fang around my neck.

02:40:01.210 --> 02:40:03.370
MATT: Thatâ€™s a keepsake for actually slaying a dragon.

02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:06.010
Youâ€™re welcome to trade that. Itâ€™s worth quite a bit.

02:40:06.010 --> 02:40:06.410
MARISHA: No.

02:40:06.410 --> 02:40:06.780

ASHLEY: That was the white dragon?

02:40:08.040 --> 02:40:08.960
MATT: That was the white dragon.

02:40:08.970 --> 02:40:10.660
ORION: Yeah, it was the white dragon you killed.

02:40:11.230 --> 02:40:12.430
MATT: Thatâ€™s the one that you got the final blow on.

02:40:12.430 --> 02:40:13.970
MARISHA: What was your persuasion?
MATT: Thatâ€™s the one that you got the final blow on.

02:40:13.970 --> 02:40:15.060
TALIESIN: Not worth the memory of killing a white dragon.
MARISHA: What was your persuasion?

02:40:15.060 --> 02:40:16.890
TALIESIN: Not worth the memory of killing a white dragon.

02:40:16.890 --> 02:40:17.920
ASHLEY: I know, I gotta keep it.

MATT: Anyway.

02:40:18.330 --> 02:40:18.900

SHERRI: "Dragonsâ€™ teeth actually, strangely enough,

02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:29.090

TRAVIS: Weâ€™ve got three.

02:40:40.660 --> 02:40:43.870
KEYLETH: And how about the basilisk eggs? While weâ€™re --

02:40:43.870 --> 02:40:44.660
LIAM: Get it out out.

KEYLETH: --cleaning our bag out, exactly.

MATT: As you pull out the basilisk eggs,

02:40:53.820 --> 02:40:56.010
you pull it out and immediately there is a stench

02:40:56.680 --> 02:40:58.080
that is emanating from these eggs

02:40:58.080 --> 02:40:59.140
that have been in your bag of holding

02:40:59.140 --> 02:41:01.200
for probably close to eight or nine months.

02:41:02.090 --> 02:41:03.960
GROG: No, the smell means theyâ€™re good.

02:41:05.630 --> 02:41:07.560
MATT: This is now the fourth time sheâ€™s looked at you

02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:10.170
with a deadpan glance and adjusted her glasses.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:13.310
SHERRI: "Weâ€™re not interested in the eggs,

"but thank you anyway."

02:41:14.650 --> 02:41:19.480
GROG: All right, we do have three pints of dragonâ€™s blood.

VEX: This is super, super powerful.

02:41:21.420 --> 02:41:23.950
GROG: It mightâ€™ve congealed a little bit actually, though.

02:41:24.580 --> 02:41:27.540
PIKE: No, itâ€™s absolutely just really fresh because we

02:41:27.540 --> 02:41:27.710
put it in Tupperware.

LAURA: Youâ€™ll stick with the scales.

GROG: Right, any chance youâ€™d be interested

02:41:33.760 --> 02:41:35.760
in claws of an umber hulk?

02:41:39.330 --> 02:41:43.420
LIAM: I like that the 400,000 people who saw that thing

02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:44.700
are tuning in to the shopping episode.

TALIESIN AND MARISHA: To the shopping episode!

LIAM: Weâ€™ve been fighting and killing for weeks,

02:41:49.500 --> 02:41:51.860
and now weâ€™re haggling over prices.

02:41:51.860 --> 02:41:53.730
ORION: But we do need new gear.

02:41:53.730 --> 02:41:54.570
MATT: Timing is everything.

02:41:54.570 --> 02:41:55.560
MARISHA: We do need new gear.

02:41:56.420 --> 02:41:58.800
MATT: This has now turned into the flea-market episode.

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.330
Hey, you guys guide the story. Itâ€™s fun though.

02:42:02.330 --> 02:42:03.780

SHERRI: "Weâ€™d say with the credit from the dragon scales,

02:42:07.230 --> 02:42:11.390
"thatâ€™ll take 10,000, 11,000 away from the current pricing,

02:42:11.390 --> 02:42:16.280
"that would put us at 39,815 for this batch."

02:42:17.020 --> 02:42:19.770
KEYLETH: So can we open that line of credit

02:42:19.770 --> 02:42:20.830
we were talking about?

LIAM: Wait, DM, where am I with Gilmore?

02:42:35.850 --> 02:42:36.930
MATT: Weâ€™ll get to that right now.

02:42:39.530 --> 02:42:40.830
ORION: It takes time to make a --

02:42:40.830 --> 02:42:43.290
VEX: We could advertise for Gilmore.

02:42:44.980 --> 02:42:45.640
KEYLETH: Yeah.

02:42:45.640 --> 02:42:47.440
PIKE: We could advertise, but maybe we should wait

02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:51.790
until they get back so if their walk goes really well,

02:42:51.790 --> 02:42:56.020
whatever that means, we could maybe try to strike a deal.

02:42:56.020 --> 02:42:57.100
KEYLETH: Right, put this on layaway?

02:42:57.100 --> 02:42:58.740
VEX: Heâ€™ll probably give us everything for free.

02:42:58.740 --> 02:43:01.090
PIKE: Because we probably need to talk to Gilmore about the credit.

02:43:01.530 --> 02:43:01.890
TIBERIUS: True.

02:43:01.890 --> 02:43:02.490
PERCY: Yes, thatâ€™s fair.

02:43:02.490 --> 02:43:04.660
KEYLETH: So can we hold this for now?

02:43:04.660 --> 02:43:05.570
PIKE: Weâ€™ll wait until Gilmore gets back.

02:43:05.570 --> 02:43:06.660
SHERRI: "Certainly."
PIKE: Weâ€™ll wait until Gilmore gets back.

02:43:06.660 --> 02:43:07.710
KEYLETH: Oh, good.

02:43:07.710 --> 02:43:08.980

MATT: Starts putting everything into

02:43:10.780 --> 02:43:12.430
a small layaway pile in the corner.

02:43:12.910 --> 02:43:17.060
KEYLETH: So you guys. Natural history museum?

02:43:17.060 --> 02:43:19.060
Pizza and then natural history museum?

02:43:19.060 --> 02:43:20.450
TIBERIUS: What is pizza?

02:43:20.450 --> 02:43:22.220
MATT: In the meantime.

02:43:22.220 --> 02:43:23.980
TIBERIUS: It sounds wonderful.

02:43:24.530 --> 02:43:26.300
KEYLETH: Weâ€™ve got time, weâ€™ve gotta wait

02:43:26.300 --> 02:43:27.660
for their man-date, we can go see some sights.

02:43:27.660 --> 02:43:29.400
MATT: In the meantime.
for their man-date, we can go see some sights.

02:43:30.400 --> 02:43:30.690
LIAM: In-between time.

02:43:30.690 --> 02:43:31.610
MATT: Vax.
LIAM: In-between time.

02:43:31.610 --> 02:43:36.210
MATT: Yes. Gilmore, who has

02:43:36.210 --> 02:43:39.210
sweeped you out into the middle of Abedarâ€™s Promenade,

02:43:40.210 --> 02:43:43.280
takes you by the arm and begins to lead you happily

02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:46.240
up towards the Erudite Quarter of Emon,

02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:48.330
which has a secondary wall around it as well.

02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:49.720
As he brings you along,

02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:52.810
he talks happily and loudly about how,

02:43:52.810 --> 02:43:55.300
GILMORE: "Itâ€™s rather wonderful the way that we were

02:43:55.300 --> 02:43:57.580
"presented with this opportunity over in Westruun.

02:43:57.580 --> 02:44:01.000
"Itâ€™s magnificent, the team theyâ€™ve assembled

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.960
"to build this brand. Iâ€™m very excited at how they

02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:06.270
"brought it to my attention. I wanted to keep things

02:44:06.270 --> 02:44:09.600
"very localized, of course, but it seems--"

02:44:10.620 --> 02:44:12.160
VAX: Will you trust the folk in Emon

02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:14.620
to handle your business or will you go between?

02:44:14.620 --> 02:44:16.620
GILMORE: "The folk in Westruun?"

02:44:16.620 --> 02:44:17.230
VAX: Yes.
GILMORE: "The folk in Westruun?"

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:19.880
GILMORE: "I have a couple of friends there that will

02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:23.530
"oversee the process, but I will be very involved

02:44:23.530 --> 02:44:26.370
"and keeping an eye, so Iâ€™m not too terribly worried.

02:44:26.370 --> 02:44:27.980
"Besides, itâ€™s a much smaller business

02:44:27.980 --> 02:44:29.290
"weâ€™re running there and itâ€™ll be fine.

02:44:30.210 --> 02:44:31.210
"Oh, look ahead.

02:44:31.210 --> 02:44:33.010
MATT: As you guys step into the Erudite Quarter,

02:44:33.010 --> 02:44:34.590
heâ€™s now brought you into essentially what is

02:44:34.590 --> 02:44:38.360
an outdoor botanical garden that is just a very nice walk.

02:44:38.580 --> 02:44:42.290
Grass across the ground, with fine well-cut bushes.

02:44:42.290 --> 02:44:45.860
There is a canopy of beautiful trees that are arcane,

02:44:45.860 --> 02:44:48.750
through arcane means, twisted and sculpted to form

02:44:48.750 --> 02:44:51.770
this long tunnel. Itâ€™s strangely romantic.

02:44:53.340 --> 02:44:54.760
As Gilmore begins to walk you down,

02:44:54.760 --> 02:44:56.370
thereâ€™s a fountain to the side, and he says,

02:44:59.530 --> 02:45:02.350
GILMORE: "What about you? Howâ€™s Vox Machina been?

02:45:02.350 --> 02:45:07.040
"Howâ€™ve they been treating you? How are you, Vax?

02:45:07.640 --> 02:45:10.580
VAX: Well, weâ€™re tired, to be sure.

02:45:10.580 --> 02:45:14.640
I was not kidding before, we really are lucky to be alive.

02:45:15.330 --> 02:45:18.760
And thatâ€™s thanks in large part to

02:45:18.760 --> 02:45:22.270
a lot of the gear you outfitted us with the last time.

02:45:22.810 --> 02:45:24.940
GILMORE: "Wondrous, Iâ€™m happy to help.

02:45:24.940 --> 02:45:27.200
"And have you been keeping up your end of the bargain?

02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:29.250
"Have you been singing the praises of

02:45:29.250 --> 02:45:32.220
"Gilmoreâ€™s Glorious Goods across Kraghammer and beyond?"

02:45:32.830 --> 02:45:34.660
VAX: You were mentioned in Kraghammer.

02:45:34.660 --> 02:45:38.730
I regret to inform you, though, that we

02:45:38.730 --> 02:45:41.130
were forced to travel underground rather quickly

02:45:41.130 --> 02:45:47.070
and the duergar and the other things that we ran into

02:45:47.070 --> 02:45:50.490
were not really customers youâ€™d want to deal with.

02:45:51.610 --> 02:45:55.420
No, our lives were too much in harmâ€™s way.

02:45:55.420 --> 02:45:57.330
But now that weâ€™re above ground,

02:45:57.330 --> 02:46:00.380
Iâ€™m looking to pick up where I left off.

02:46:00.380 --> 02:46:01.930
GILMORE: "Very well."
And do your shop honor.

02:46:01.980 --> 02:46:05.070
VAX: Your contribution to what weâ€™ve done --

02:46:05.070 --> 02:46:06.830
LIAM: And I place my hand on his hand.

02:46:10.410 --> 02:46:13.490
VAX: --was no small part in our survival.

02:46:14.140 --> 02:46:16.800
LIAM: And I give it just a little squeeze.

02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:21.570
VAX: And I want to thank you.

02:46:24.620 --> 02:46:27.600
I donâ€™t know that I would be standing here

02:46:27.600 --> 02:46:28.910
if not for your help.

02:46:30.430 --> 02:46:34.650
GILMORE: "Had it not been for Gilmoreâ€™s Glorious Goods."

02:46:34.650 --> 02:46:37.740
(all laugh)

02:46:37.850 --> 02:46:39.120
MATT: He looks you deep in the eyes,

02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:40.580
pats the top of your hand, and goes,

02:46:42.720 --> 02:46:46.180
GILMORE: "Vax. This, that moment,

02:46:47.100 --> 02:46:49.520
"that is why I do what I do."

02:46:54.500 --> 02:46:57.690
VAX: Youâ€™re a unique man, Gilmore. No question.

02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:01.130
Never met anyone quite like you.

02:47:01.620 --> 02:47:04.930
GILMORE: "Well. Would you care to share a glass of wine

02:47:04.930 --> 02:47:07.940
"with a man not quite like anyone else youâ€™ve met?"

02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:11.400
VAX: Indeed. What do you recommend in the area?

02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:14.250
GILMORE: "Oh, please, come, there are casks that

02:47:14.250 --> 02:47:17.840
"pour the finest of honeyed Syngoran wine.

02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:19.420
"I know perhaps youâ€™ve not been home

02:47:19.420 --> 02:47:20.480
"for quite some time?"

02:47:21.310 --> 02:47:25.880
VAX: Thatâ€™s a complicated thing for me,

02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:31.140
one that Iâ€™m not really quite ready to talk about yet.

02:47:31.140 --> 02:47:31.640
GILMORE: "Oh."

02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:32.690
VAX: Maybe someday.

02:47:32.690 --> 02:47:34.030
GILMORE: "Maybe with enough wine."

02:47:36.610 --> 02:47:38.020
VAX: You old so-and-so.

02:47:39.100 --> 02:47:39.720
MARISHA: You old so-and-so.

02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:42.110
MATT: About an hour and a half,

02:47:42.110 --> 02:47:45.300
time passes before eventually thereâ€™s a loud clattering

02:47:45.300 --> 02:47:47.940
at the front of Gilmoreâ€™s Glorious Goods,

02:47:47.940 --> 02:47:52.770
where a laughing Vax and Gilmore come stumbling in,

02:47:52.770 --> 02:47:56.290
flush of face, with emptied goblets,

02:47:56.910 --> 02:47:58.530
laughing to themselves.

02:47:59.080 --> 02:48:00.800
Is there anything specific before this moment

02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:01.540
that you wanted to ask --

02:48:01.540 --> 02:48:03.330
VAX: I took the duergar,

02:48:03.330 --> 02:48:05.140
I was holding her right over the cliff,

02:48:05.140 --> 02:48:08.380
and I just cut, and she fell! She fell!

02:48:08.380 --> 02:48:10.210
I didnâ€™t know what I was doing, I just did it!

02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:16.350
GILMORE: "You are ridiculous, Vax'ildan! Oh, it tickles me."

02:48:16.350 --> 02:48:18.670
PIKE: Hi! Hello!

02:48:18.670 --> 02:48:20.320
GILMORE: "Oh, good to see your friends."

02:48:20.320 --> 02:48:21.500
PIKE: Sounds like you had fun.

02:48:21.500 --> 02:48:25.450
VAX: Family. Family, family.

02:48:25.450 --> 02:48:27.080
Iâ€™ve had a couple of drinks.

02:48:27.570 --> 02:48:29.540
Iâ€™m an adult, I can do that.

02:48:31.880 --> 02:48:32.590
VAX: What have you found?

02:48:32.590 --> 02:48:34.130
Have you guys been shopping?

02:48:34.830 --> 02:48:35.780
KEYLETH: Well, we have!

02:48:35.780 --> 02:48:36.350
TIBERIUS: Yes!
KEYLETH: Well, we have!

02:48:36.350 --> 02:48:38.410
KEYLETH: We were hoping that you and

02:48:38.410 --> 02:48:41.900
Gilmore had a wonderful time and that,

02:48:41.900 --> 02:48:43.160
we just thought weâ€™d wait for you.

02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:45.730
We didnâ€™t want to make any final decisions without

02:48:45.730 --> 02:48:47.730
one of our main party members.

02:48:47.950 --> 02:48:49.080
GILMORE: "It was delightful.

02:48:49.080 --> 02:48:53.170
"You travel with the finest companion.

02:48:54.020 --> 02:48:57.860
"We told stories, we cried, we laughed.

02:48:57.860 --> 02:48:59.230
"It was a delight."

02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:02.670
GILMORE: "Iâ€™ve had a few."

02:49:03.210 --> 02:49:05.050
MATT: He collects himself for a minute.

02:49:05.050 --> 02:49:08.830
LIAM: I pat him on the back, I do a little circle with my hand.

02:49:10.260 --> 02:49:11.240
MARISHA: Remember, you have advantage.

02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:14.610
GILMORE: "Iâ€™m not as spry as I once was, unfortunately.

02:49:16.770 --> 02:49:19.720
"But yes! Business to attend. What do you need?

02:49:19.720 --> 02:49:20.960
"What can we do?"

02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:24.100
MATT: At which point Sherri, waiting in the back, says,

02:49:24.930 --> 02:49:30.220
SHERRI: "Sir, theyâ€™ve requested perhaps a few things in bulk.

02:49:31.020 --> 02:49:32.820
"The current amount comes to about roughly

02:49:32.820 --> 02:49:35.980
"40,000 gold, with your discount."

02:49:35.980 --> 02:49:38.560
GILMORE: "Forty thousand gold, oh, well.

02:49:38.560 --> 02:49:40.560
"Certainly. What seems to be the problem?"

02:49:42.900 --> 02:49:47.620
PIKE: Well, I donâ€™t know. We were just talking about,

02:49:47.620 --> 02:49:50.060
since weâ€™re purchasing so many things,

02:49:50.060 --> 02:49:55.980
and since weâ€™ve gained some popularity here in Emon,

02:49:55.980 --> 02:49:59.770
walking around, people are noticing us walking around...

02:50:01.650 --> 02:50:03.500
ASHLEY: I shouldnâ€™t be the one talking right now.

02:50:05.360 --> 02:50:07.540
PIKE: Maybe we could open up a line of credit.

02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:10.180
VAX: Obviously weâ€™re only shopping

02:50:10.180 --> 02:50:11.860
with you, Gilmore, at this point.

02:50:13.080 --> 02:50:14.730
MATT: He looks about the rest of the group and says,

02:50:16.430 --> 02:50:18.780
GILMORE: "Not everyone seems to be wearing

02:50:18.780 --> 02:50:22.200
"the same patented Gilmoreâ€™s Glorious Armor

02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:26.490
"that was given not too long ago. So thatâ€™s not true."

02:50:26.490 --> 02:50:28.690
TIBERIUS: We did find some off of dead things.

02:50:28.690 --> 02:50:29.450
VAX: Yes.

02:50:29.450 --> 02:50:31.660
GILMORE: "And those dead things are not

02:50:31.660 --> 02:50:34.340
"under the umbrella of Gilmoreâ€™s Glorious Expansion."

02:50:34.340 --> 02:50:35.040
TIBERIUS: Oh.

02:50:38.340 --> 02:50:41.610
GILMORE: "But should we discuss this,

02:50:41.610 --> 02:50:43.170
"where would this credit be placed against,

02:50:43.170 --> 02:50:46.960
"what do you have that you could ante?"

02:50:46.960 --> 02:50:47.890
VAX: What have you guys been talking about?

02:50:47.890 --> 02:50:50.690
We do have a big pile of dragonâ€™s scales and some gem --

02:50:50.690 --> 02:50:52.400
VEX: We do.

02:50:52.400 --> 02:50:54.010
PERCY: We also are owed money.

02:50:54.010 --> 02:50:54.660
VAX: And we are owed money in Kraghammer.

02:50:54.660 --> 02:50:56.170
VEX: One question that
VAX: And we are owed money in Kraghammer.

02:50:56.170 --> 02:50:58.140
Grog just whispered to me.

02:50:58.140 --> 02:50:59.490
VAX: Yes?

02:50:59.490 --> 02:51:01.610
VEX: How much is a platinum worth?

02:51:03.060 --> 02:51:06.220
GILMORE: "What is a platinum? Platinum is worth ten gold pieces."

02:51:09.340 --> 02:51:10.620
LIAM: Where we at, girl?

02:51:11.780 --> 02:51:12.410
TIBERIUS: She is displeased.

02:51:12.410 --> 02:51:14.530
VEX: We may have a lot more money than I thought we had,

02:51:14.530 --> 02:51:17.320
because Grogâ€™s been hiding money in the bag of holding.

02:51:18.240 --> 02:51:19.730
(all laugh)

02:51:20.770 --> 02:51:22.040
GROG: Itâ€™s really shiny.

02:51:26.410 --> 02:51:30.180
TRAVIS: Iâ€™m in trouble, Matt. Sheâ€™s really mad.

02:51:32.270 --> 02:51:34.350
MARISHA: Wait, is this like when

02:51:34.350 --> 02:51:36.620
you slapped Trinket on the ass mad?

02:51:37.020 --> 02:51:39.210
LAURA: No. Not close, not even close.

02:51:39.210 --> 02:51:41.460
Doesnâ€™t mean as much as Trinket means.

02:51:41.460 --> 02:51:42.490
LIAM: This is finances,

02:51:42.490 --> 02:51:44.110
this sounds like a married couple.

02:51:45.960 --> 02:51:49.070
PERCY: How much platinum do we have hiding

02:51:49.070 --> 02:51:50.260
in the bag of holding?

02:51:50.890 --> 02:51:52.770
TRAVIS: I donâ€™t have the number in front of me,

02:51:52.770 --> 02:51:54.620
but itâ€™s at least 150.

02:51:56.430 --> 02:51:57.240
LAURA: Yeah.

02:51:57.240 --> 02:51:59.870
VAX: Where did we procure that again, Grog?

02:51:59.870 --> 02:52:01.700
Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m a little fershnickered.

02:52:01.700 --> 02:52:04.650
GROG: I donâ€™t remember, but itâ€™s in the bag of holding.

02:52:05.790 --> 02:52:07.560
VEX: I remember getting platinum.

02:52:07.560 --> 02:52:09.090
KEYLETH: I do remember getting platinum, too.

02:52:09.090 --> 02:52:10.650
MATT: But you donâ€™t have a number.

02:52:11.120 --> 02:52:14.430
TRAVIS: No, I know itâ€™s at least 100, at least 150,

02:52:14.430 --> 02:52:16.370
I think itâ€™s somewhere up north of 150,

02:52:16.370 --> 02:52:17.640
I just canâ€™t remember the number.

02:52:17.640 --> 02:52:19.680
LIAM: Did we get that from the dragon,

02:52:19.680 --> 02:52:21.340
where did we get that?

02:52:21.340 --> 02:52:23.000
MATT: It was a combination of the dragon,

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:23.980
the horde you rage-looted --

02:52:23.980 --> 02:52:24.940
LAURA: Rage-hoarding.
the horde you rage-looted --

02:52:25.460 --> 02:52:26.200
LAURA: Rage-looting.

02:52:26.200 --> 02:52:26.660
LIAM: Iâ€™ll never forget the rage-looting.

02:52:26.660 --> 02:52:28.200
ASHLEY: Rage-looting.
LIAM: Iâ€™ll never forget the rage-looting.

02:52:28.430 --> 02:52:30.110
GROG: Itâ€™s my shiny, though,

02:52:30.110 --> 02:52:31.760
I didnâ€™t want to give it to her, though.

02:52:31.760 --> 02:52:34.460
Sheâ€™s evil. You see how she haggles!

02:52:34.460 --> 02:52:37.820
VAX: Itâ€™s true. Sheâ€™s my sister, I know, Grog.

02:52:37.820 --> 02:52:40.850
But right now we need to put that aside

02:52:40.850 --> 02:52:42.650
and do whatâ€™s best for the party.

02:52:44.420 --> 02:52:46.590
GROG: Well, we could buy a party with all that.

02:52:46.590 --> 02:52:48.000
(all laugh)

02:52:48.330 --> 02:52:49.580
VAX: Not that kind of party, Grog.

02:52:49.580 --> 02:52:50.770
VEX: I think we have enough to buy

02:52:50.770 --> 02:52:52.660
everything if you guys want.

02:52:53.300 --> 02:52:56.410
VAX: Grog, money is meant to be spent.

02:52:57.940 --> 02:52:59.390
GROG: Iâ€™m going to drink!

02:53:00.340 --> 02:53:02.010
(all laugh)

02:53:02.440 --> 02:53:03.660
PIKE: That solves everything.

02:53:03.660 --> 02:53:06.380
MATT: Scanlan goes,

02:53:06.380 --> 02:53:09.130
SCANLAN: I agree. Drinks and whoring.

02:53:09.570 --> 02:53:11.880
MATT: And smacks Grog in the side.

02:53:11.880 --> 02:53:16.200
The two of them leave off into the evening to go ahead and

02:53:16.200 --> 02:53:17.530
make use of their return to Emon properly.

02:53:17.530 --> 02:53:19.970
LIAM: Vax looks at Gilmore and just shakes his head.

02:53:22.280 --> 02:53:23.260
GILMORE: "There is business to be had,

02:53:23.260 --> 02:53:24.450
"but letâ€™s get business out of the way

02:53:24.450 --> 02:53:26.450
"so we can get to pleasure."

02:53:27.100 --> 02:53:28.240
ASHLEY: Oh, shit.

02:53:28.240 --> 02:53:28.980
LIAM: Cheers to that.

02:53:29.660 --> 02:53:30.650
MARISHA: Cheers to that.

02:53:31.080 --> 02:53:32.640
TALIESIN: I have tinkering to do anyway.

02:53:34.210 --> 02:53:35.360
VEX: What did we agree the total

02:53:35.360 --> 02:53:37.060
for everything we wanted was?

02:53:37.060 --> 02:53:39.610
GILMORE: "Roughly 39,500 gold pieces."

02:53:39.610 --> 02:53:40.330
VAX: Pish-posh.

02:53:40.330 --> 02:53:42.060
VEX: Roughly. Gilmore.

02:53:42.970 --> 02:53:44.010
GILMORE: "Thatâ€™s with the discount!

02:53:44.010 --> 02:53:45.180
"I already offered this to you,

02:53:45.180 --> 02:53:46.980
"and you havenâ€™t even kept up your end of the bargain

02:53:46.980 --> 02:53:48.980
"by wearing my emblazoned symbol and my

02:53:48.980 --> 02:53:51.930
VEX: Donâ€™t you want us to advertise in Westruun for you?
"immortalized Gilmoreâ€™s Glorious Armor."

02:53:53.330 --> 02:53:57.860
VAX: We would, Gilmore, we would be wearing that.

02:53:58.570 --> 02:53:59.940
Again, we nearly died.

02:54:01.120 --> 02:54:04.160
The armor that you gave me is gone, and

02:54:04.160 --> 02:54:05.960
Iâ€™m lucky to be alive today,

02:54:05.960 --> 02:54:09.060
and that armor helped me be where I am at the moment.

02:54:09.460 --> 02:54:10.900
GILMORE: "How much credit do you wish to open?"

02:54:11.860 --> 02:54:12.830
VAX: Fifty gold.

02:54:14.120 --> 02:54:15.760
PIKE: Thousand? Fifty thousand?

02:54:15.760 --> 02:54:17.760
VAX: Fifty, ah yes. Fifty thousand.

02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:19.620
GILMORE: "Because 50 gold I can definitely do."

02:54:19.620 --> 02:54:22.360
VAX: Weâ€™ve been out drinking for two hours, man.

02:54:22.360 --> 02:54:23.730
GILMORE: "This is true. Iâ€™m sorry."

02:54:23.730 --> 02:54:25.460
ASHLEY: One million, please.

02:54:25.930 --> 02:54:29.660
GILMORE: "Thatâ€™s a tough order."

02:54:30.210 --> 02:54:32.280
GILMORE: "You mentioned you had money

02:54:32.280 --> 02:54:35.000
"waiting for you in Kraghammer. How much was --"

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:36.100
VEX: Yes, we do.

02:54:36.100 --> 02:54:37.530
GILMORE: "How much is waiting for you there?"

02:54:38.640 --> 02:54:39.960
VAX: Twenty-five, wasnâ€™t it?

02:54:40.220 --> 02:54:42.080
VEX: It was 25,000.

02:54:42.080 --> 02:54:46.260
GILMORE: "How about we open a 25,000 gold piece

02:54:46.260 --> 02:54:48.940
"line of credit here with Gilmoreâ€™s Glorious Goods

"that you only need to pay back within the next month."

02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:53.940
VAX: Thatâ€™s fair.

02:54:53.940 --> 02:54:56.430
GILMORE: "Giving you time to arrive. If itâ€™s not paid,

02:54:56.430 --> 02:54:57.760
"you will be hunted.

"But Iâ€™m sure that wonâ€™t be a worry, will it?"

02:55:03.260 --> 02:55:05.000
TIBERIUS: How far is Kraghammer from here?

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:05.740
PERCY: Not far.

02:55:06.410 --> 02:55:08.850
VEX: Itâ€™s a weekâ€™s ride, isnâ€™t it?

02:55:08.850 --> 02:55:10.260
TIBERIUS: I canâ€™t teleport everyone.

02:55:11.820 --> 02:55:13.720
KEYLETH: Gilmore, question.

02:55:13.720 --> 02:55:16.460
Maybe you should consider making little pins

02:55:16.460 --> 02:55:19.150
that we could just wear on top of our armor?

02:55:19.150 --> 02:55:21.950
Because wearing your armor,

02:55:21.950 --> 02:55:24.760
we have our own clothes that we like,

02:55:25.870 --> 02:55:27.080
so maybe like a pin.

02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:28.180
MATT: He steps forward and says,

02:55:28.180 --> 02:55:29.180
GILMORE: "Oh --"

02:55:29.180 --> 02:55:30.030
KEYLETH: Or like a patch?

02:55:30.030 --> 02:55:31.760
GILMORE: "--thatâ€™s not even a worry."

02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:34.140
MATT: He pulls out a small implement, this wand,

02:55:34.140 --> 02:55:35.470
and he flicks it over your shoulder.

02:55:35.470 --> 02:55:38.890
And all of a sudden an arcane swirl around your armor,

02:55:39.470 --> 02:55:42.510
with a big flash of sparks and glitter almost.

02:55:42.510 --> 02:55:43.960
You look down and there is,

02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:46.520
emblazoned upon your current armored form,

02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:49.420
a symbol of Gilmoreâ€™s Glorious Goods

02:55:49.420 --> 02:55:51.570
now permanently emblazoned on the leather.

02:55:53.170 --> 02:55:54.010
KEYLETH: Ah!

02:55:54.650 --> 02:55:55.840
GILMORE: "Easy enough to fix."

02:55:55.840 --> 02:55:56.880
VAX: What a good idea.

02:55:56.880 --> 02:55:57.440
KEYLETH: I was going to put it on that leather.

02:55:57.440 --> 02:55:57.810
PERCY: Yes.
KEYLETH: I was going to put it on that leather.

02:55:57.810 --> 02:55:58.880
KEYLETH: I was going to put it on that leather.

02:56:00.570 --> 02:56:02.730
My mom gave this to me.

02:56:02.730 --> 02:56:04.900
GILMORE: "Well, your mother has not provided for you

02:56:04.900 --> 02:56:07.280
"the means of keeping the deal we already made."

02:56:07.280 --> 02:56:09.630
KEYLETH: Can you take this off when we pay you back

02:56:09.630 --> 02:56:10.930
and put it on that one?

02:56:10.930 --> 02:56:12.860
KEYLETH: Oh, come on.

02:56:15.820 --> 02:56:17.920
PERCY: I think itâ€™ll transfer when you change.

02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:19.610
KEYLETH: Will it transfer when I change armor?

02:56:19.610 --> 02:56:20.560
GILMORE: "I donâ€™t know."

02:56:20.930 --> 02:56:23.880
(all laugh)

02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:25.870
PIKE: Weâ€™ll find out.

02:56:25.870 --> 02:56:27.530
GILMORE: "So. Twenty-five thousand gold line of credit,

02:56:27.530 --> 02:56:28.850
"within a month or youâ€™ll be hunted."

02:56:29.390 --> 02:56:31.020
KEYLETH: Wait, do you really have a unicorn

02:56:31.020 --> 02:56:32.480
as part of your logo?

02:56:33.180 --> 02:56:34.440
GILMORE: "Itâ€™sâ€¦"

02:56:34.440 --> 02:56:35.040
KEYLETH: What?

02:56:35.040 --> 02:56:36.760
GILMORE: "Itâ€™s a creature of my creation,

02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:37.680
"I designed it when I was a child --"

02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:38.740
VAX: Itâ€™s a phallic thing.

02:56:38.740 --> 02:56:39.710
KEYLETH: Ah.

02:56:41.470 --> 02:56:44.090
VEX: So we open the 25,000 line of credit with you

02:56:44.090 --> 02:56:45.850
and you give us all the things we want?

02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:47.500
GILMORE: "If that is what you want."

02:56:47.500 --> 02:56:49.090
VAX: Donâ€™t we have a lot of platinum?

02:56:49.090 --> 02:56:50.920
What are we dickering prices with?

02:56:50.920 --> 02:56:52.690
VEX: Yes! Why donâ€™t we just buy it now,

02:56:52.690 --> 02:56:53.720
and then we wonâ€™t have a line of credit with Gilmore?

02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:55.340
GROG: (cries)
and then we wonâ€™t have a line of credit with Gilmore?

02:56:56.530 --> 02:56:58.640
VAX: Yes, weâ€™ll use some of the platinum.

02:56:58.640 --> 02:57:00.960
One platinum is equal to ten gold.

02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:02.190
Sorry, Gilmore.

02:57:02.900 --> 02:57:04.380
Trying to dicker over rates.

02:57:04.380 --> 02:57:05.320
PIKE: Not a line of credit?

02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:06.280
VAX: No line of credit,

02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:09.900
weâ€™ll pay for it outright in cold hard platinum.

02:57:10.650 --> 02:57:12.670
MATT: You donâ€™t have the amount of platinum with you.

02:57:13.930 --> 02:57:15.000
LIAM: But Grogâ€™s got it.

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
MATT: Grog said, because he doesnâ€™t have it in front of him,

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:18.810
he has around 150 platinum.

02:57:18.850 --> 02:57:20.750
VEX: We can pay him back, itâ€™s true.
MATT: Thatâ€™s roughly 1500 gold.

02:57:20.750 --> 02:57:20.940
MATT: Thatâ€™s roughly 1500 gold.

02:57:20.940 --> 02:57:22.100
LIAM: But where is it?

02:57:22.270 --> 02:57:23.480
MATT: Itâ€™s in the bag of holding, but he doesnâ€™t have

02:57:23.480 --> 02:57:24.980
the bag of holding information in front of him.

02:57:24.980 --> 02:57:26.620
LIAM: He doesnâ€™t have the info.

02:57:26.620 --> 02:57:28.170
And because he doesnâ€™t have the sheet --

02:57:28.170 --> 02:57:28.810
TALIESIN: --next game.

02:57:28.810 --> 02:57:31.080
LIAM: --and he canâ€™t read the exact amount?

02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:33.840
MATT: Yup. Because he said in memory

02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:36.670
itâ€™s 150 platinum. Thatâ€™s only --

02:57:36.670 --> 02:57:39.320
LIAM: I thought it was a 100,000.

02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:40.080
MATT: Oh, no.

02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:41.620
LAURA: No no no, 150 platinum.

02:57:41.620 --> 02:57:42.810
LIAM: Oh, 150.

02:57:42.810 --> 02:57:44.260
MATT: Hundred thousand youâ€™d be the richest man

02:57:44.260 --> 02:57:44.880
in the fucking world.

02:57:44.880 --> 02:57:45.650
LIAM: Okay.
in the fucking world.

02:57:47.620 --> 02:57:49.660
MATT: So 150 platinum --

02:57:49.660 --> 02:57:50.370
VAX: What do you think, sis?

02:57:50.370 --> 02:57:55.180
MATT: --based on memory is 11,500,

02:57:55.180 --> 02:57:56.700
VAX: Vox Machina treasurer?
MATT: which is a little helpful.

02:57:56.700 --> 02:57:57.550
VEX: Right.

02:57:57.550 --> 02:57:58.160
VAX: What do you think?

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.230
VEX: That would put us at about 30,000

02:58:01.230 --> 02:58:03.820
that we have to spend left,

02:58:04.660 --> 02:58:08.210
which the signal cut out so it doesnâ€™t matter.

02:58:08.210 --> 02:58:08.740
MATT: No, weâ€™ve got you.

02:58:08.740 --> 02:58:08.960
MARISHA: No, we can hear you!

02:58:08.960 --> 02:58:09.710
LIAM: No, weâ€™ve got you.
MARISHA: No, we can hear you!

02:58:09.710 --> 02:58:10.490
VEX: Okay.

02:58:10.490 --> 02:58:14.510
VAX: So the total tab is what again, Gilmore?

02:58:14.510 --> 02:58:16.100
LAURA: How much do we have?

02:58:16.100 --> 02:58:18.040
He does have a picture of it.

02:58:19.570 --> 02:58:22.760
We have 1,620 platinum.

02:58:22.760 --> 02:58:23.530
MARISHA: What!

02:58:23.530 --> 02:58:25.850
MATT: Is that right? There you go.

02:58:26.740 --> 02:58:28.100
ORION: So thatâ€™s like--

02:58:28.750 --> 02:58:30.990
MATT: 16,000 gold pieces.

02:58:31.410 --> 02:58:33.460
VAX: All right. Spend it.

02:58:34.280 --> 02:58:35.230
VAX: Spend it.

02:58:35.230 --> 02:58:36.380
KEYLETH: All right. No!

02:58:36.380 --> 02:58:38.590
PIKE: So we donâ€™t need to open up a line of credit?

02:58:38.590 --> 02:58:39.120
VAX: No.

02:58:39.120 --> 02:58:42.170
MATT: Ten gold per platinum.

02:58:42.170 --> 02:58:43.220
ORION: We have 1,000.

02:58:43.220 --> 02:58:46.270
MATT: A thousand platinum. One thousand six hundred platinum.

02:58:46.770 --> 02:58:48.140
Move the decimal point.

02:58:48.140 --> 02:58:50.650
That brings it to 16,000 gold pieces.

02:58:50.650 --> 02:58:51.980
ORION: Move two on that.

02:58:51.980 --> 02:58:54.020
MATT: No, itâ€™s not 100 gold per platinum,

02:58:54.020 --> 02:58:54.890
ten gold per platinum.

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:57.240
MATT: Iâ€™ve been saying ten gold per platinum

02:58:57.240 --> 02:58:58.050
this whole time, guys.

02:58:58.610 --> 02:59:00.100
TALIESIN: No, Iâ€™m with you.

02:59:00.100 --> 02:59:00.660
ORION: I get it.

02:59:00.660 --> 02:59:02.410
LIAM: Weâ€™re losing our audience. Ring it up.

02:59:02.410 --> 02:59:03.360
MATT: Weâ€™re getting into math in this.

02:59:03.920 --> 02:59:06.660
MARISHA: Our charity, 826LA, after-school tutoring.

02:59:08.600 --> 02:59:09.770
TALIESIN: It couldâ€™ve made this all go so much better.

02:59:09.770 --> 02:59:11.660
MARISHA: Really good to have,
TALIESIN: It couldâ€™ve made this all go so much better.

02:59:11.660 --> 02:59:14.440
MARISA: Your reading and your writing and your arithmetic.

02:59:15.880 --> 02:59:17.330
TALIESIN: For players who can read good.

02:59:17.960 --> 02:59:19.730
MARISHA: For players who can read good.

02:59:20.140 --> 02:59:22.030
VAX: Ring it up, weâ€™ll take it.

02:59:22.030 --> 02:59:23.530
PIKE: Weâ€™ll take it all.

02:59:23.530 --> 02:59:24.170
VAX: The whole lot.

02:59:24.170 --> 02:59:26.720
PIKE: And then, could I commission you, by the way,

02:59:26.720 --> 02:59:29.730
to maybe make some armor thatâ€™s really heavy armor

02:59:29.730 --> 02:59:31.730
but very quiet?

02:59:32.920 --> 02:59:34.090
GILMORE: "How heavy?"

02:59:36.810 --> 02:59:39.140
PIKE: How heavy can you make it?

02:59:39.140 --> 02:59:41.770
GILMORE: "I can work on plate armor if youâ€™d like,

02:59:41.770 --> 02:59:43.770

VAX: Weâ€™ll fund the money.

03:00:14.780 --> 03:00:17.850
PIKE: And itâ€™ll just be really quiet?

GILMORE: "It will enable you to move freer within the armor."

03:00:23.360 --> 03:00:26.650
VAX: By a turn. Is 8,000

03:00:26.650 --> 03:00:30.170
Vox Machinaâ€™s rate, or the general rate?

03:00:30.170 --> 03:00:31.820

GILMORE: "So minus the platinum, thatâ€™s 22,000 gold pieces

03:01:27.570 --> 03:01:29.450
"after the platinum and dragon scales."

03:01:29.820 --> 03:01:31.650
KEYLETH: And we have that, right?

03:01:32.330 --> 03:01:37.070
GILMORE: "And you have 25,000 gold credit if youâ€™d like."

03:01:37.070 --> 03:01:41.310
VEX: We have, hold on... gotta go away for a minute.

03:01:43.380 --> 03:01:45.150
VAX: Weâ€™re passing on the credit, Gilmore.

03:01:45.150 --> 03:01:46.980
VEX: We have plenty left.

03:01:46.980 --> 03:01:47.570
VAX: Yes.

03:01:47.570 --> 03:01:48.930
PERCY: All right.

03:01:48.930 --> 03:01:51.140
LIAM: You guys are a black screen, what happened?

03:01:51.140 --> 03:01:51.640
TALIESIN: They paused it.

03:01:51.640 --> 03:01:54.110
LAURA: I was looking at my calculator.

03:01:54.110 --> 03:01:55.980
LIAM: All right, we hear you. There you are!

03:01:56.210 --> 03:01:57.310
ORION: Abacus!

03:01:58.450 --> 03:02:02.480
VAX: Youâ€™re so dark sometimes, Vexâ€™ahlia. I swear.

03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:04.210
VEX: So the total was 20,000

03:02:04.210 --> 03:02:06.440
minus the platinum and the dragon scales?

03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:08.000
GILMORE: "Twenty-two thousand."

03:02:08.340 --> 03:02:10.420
VEX: Yes, we still have enough, so.

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:13.850
GILMORE: "All right. So a deal?"

03:02:14.360 --> 03:02:15.410
KEYLETH: Deal!

03:02:15.410 --> 03:02:16.300
PERCY: Deal.

03:02:16.300 --> 03:02:18.300
VEX: My god, all of our moneyâ€™s gone.

03:02:18.300 --> 03:02:20.300
MATT: He snaps his fingers,

03:02:20.300 --> 03:02:22.770
Sherri comes and presents all the items that she had currently

03:02:22.770 --> 03:02:25.300
in a little stowaway bin off to the side of the desk.

03:02:25.810 --> 03:02:26.850
Brings them out to the rest of you

03:02:26.850 --> 03:02:27.950
and places it on the counter.

03:02:27.950 --> 03:02:30.050
Gilmore immediately snaps his fingers

03:02:30.050 --> 03:02:32.350
and a contract shows up.

03:02:32.350 --> 03:02:34.830
He writes up the numbers exchanged,

03:02:34.830 --> 03:02:38.060
making note of his business, passes it out.

03:02:38.060 --> 03:02:39.490
GILMORE: "Please sign here.

03:02:39.490 --> 03:02:43.010
"Anyone that represents you and your fine Vox Machina.

03:02:43.010 --> 03:02:45.010
"Sign here and present the money."

03:02:46.220 --> 03:02:47.660
VEX: I guess Iâ€™ll do that.

03:02:47.660 --> 03:02:48.450
PERCY: You do that.

03:02:49.180 --> 03:02:49.930
GILMORE: "Vexâ€™ahlia."

03:02:49.930 --> 03:02:51.640
MATT: He hands you a quill.

03:02:52.690 --> 03:02:55.810
Takes your coin, slides you,

03:02:55.810 --> 03:02:59.660
and you now have this entire batch of magical items

03:02:59.660 --> 03:03:00.690
LAURA: Thatâ€™s pretty cool.
MATT: to distribute as you see fit.

03:03:00.690 --> 03:03:02.130
MATT: to distribute as you see fit.

03:03:02.130 --> 03:03:04.410
MARISHA: Yes! New armor!

03:03:04.720 --> 03:03:05.660
MATT: And from that point --

03:03:05.660 --> 03:03:08.140
LAURA: Make sure we get some of those things.

03:03:10.120 --> 03:03:11.780
GILMORE: "An absolute pleasure

03:03:11.780 --> 03:03:14.520
"doing business with all of you. Absolutely."

03:03:14.520 --> 03:03:15.460
KEYLETH: Thank you, Gilmore.

03:03:15.460 --> 03:03:17.310
GILMORE: "Thank you."

03:03:17.310 --> 03:03:21.770
KEYLETH: So really though. Will this transfer to that?

03:03:21.770 --> 03:03:23.120
GILMORE: "I have no idea."

03:03:24.930 --> 03:03:27.020
KEYLETH: I was wanting to ask you, Gilmore.

03:03:27.790 --> 03:03:31.760
Have you considered maybe doing potion-making workshops?

03:03:33.880 --> 03:03:35.100
GILMORE: "Hm. Iâ€™ll put some thought to that."

03:03:35.100 --> 03:03:36.510
KEYLETH: Okay. Let me know.

03:03:36.510 --> 03:03:37.120
GILMORE: "All right."

03:03:37.940 --> 03:03:39.950
LAURA: I feel very uncomfortable and I leave.

03:03:39.950 --> 03:03:41.890
I go outside to hang out with Trinket.

03:03:42.810 --> 03:03:43.560
MATT: Okay.

03:03:44.430 --> 03:03:47.250
MATT: As Gilmore takes the change behind the counter, he goes,

03:03:47.250 --> 03:03:50.430
GILMORE: "Iâ€™ve got a bit more business to do here.

03:03:51.290 --> 03:03:55.930
"Vax, I greatly appreciate spending the afternoon with you.

03:03:55.930 --> 03:03:57.840
"Where are you staying?"

03:03:59.330 --> 03:04:02.360
LIAM: I take him by the hand, do one of these clasps, and say,

03:04:02.820 --> 03:04:05.070
VAX: We live here now, weâ€™re residents.

03:04:05.070 --> 03:04:06.380
I havenâ€™t had time to tell you.

03:04:06.380 --> 03:04:09.080
We have a keep, our own keep. You should come visit.

03:04:09.780 --> 03:04:12.100
Itâ€™s on the outskirts of town. Itâ€™s called Greyskull Keep,

03:04:12.100 --> 03:04:13.680
and youâ€™re welcome any time.

03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:15.440
Day or night.

03:04:15.980 --> 03:04:18.490
GILMORE: "Good to know.

03:04:18.490 --> 03:04:22.320
"All right. To business I go. I bid you all a fine farewell."

03:04:22.320 --> 03:04:22.930
PERCY: Adieu.

03:04:23.620 --> 03:04:24.510
KEYLETH: Bye, Gilmore.

03:04:24.510 --> 03:04:30.050
MATT: He goes back through his beaded exit to the back room

03:04:30.620 --> 03:04:32.960
and leaves you to the rest of your--

03:04:32.960 --> 03:04:34.060
--at which point Sherri goes,

03:04:35.900 --> 03:04:37.790
SHERRI: "Iâ€™ll get back to work."

03:04:38.300 --> 03:04:39.330
MATT: She goes back up,

03:04:39.330 --> 03:04:40.940
leaving you guys alone in the main chamber

03:04:40.940 --> 03:04:43.250
as a couple of other customers start walking around.

03:04:45.480 --> 03:04:49.260
MATT: I think weâ€™ll call that the adventure for the evening.

03:04:49.420 --> 03:04:50.970
MARISHA: Thanks for watching us shop.

03:04:50.970 --> 03:04:51.810
ASHLEY: Thanks for watching us shop!

03:04:51.810 --> 03:04:53.160
LAURA: All the moneyâ€™s gone!

03:04:53.160 --> 03:04:55.560
MATT: All the moneyâ€™s gone. You spent it, guys.

03:04:55.560 --> 03:04:57.820
MARISHA: We have 25 waiting for us in Kraghammer.

03:04:57.820 --> 03:04:59.020
MATT: Thatâ€™s true, you didnâ€™t open the line of credit.

03:04:59.020 --> 03:04:59.660
LAURA: Yeah, weâ€™d better get that.

03:04:59.660 --> 03:05:02.900
MARISHA: At least weâ€™re not in debt.

03:05:02.900 --> 03:05:06.040
LIAM: The world is full of money, Vex'halia.

03:05:07.180 --> 03:05:08.990
TRAVIS: We got more money?

03:05:08.990 --> 03:05:10.810
ASHLEY: Who had dibs on what?

03:05:11.440 --> 03:05:13.840
TALIESIN: I wanted the dexterity boost

03:05:13.840 --> 03:05:15.320
and I was thinking of the mithral.

03:05:15.730 --> 03:05:18.160
MARISHA: And I want the leather armor and he wants the cape.

03:05:20.100 --> 03:05:21.760
ASHLEY: I can't use the sword, right?

03:05:22.800 --> 03:05:24.120
The frostband sword?

03:05:24.510 --> 03:05:25.790
LIAM: No, clerics can't use swords.

03:05:25.790 --> 03:05:28.270
MATT: Check on your class, you might have access to it.

03:05:29.880 --> 03:05:30.900
Let me check here for you real fast.

03:05:30.900 --> 03:05:35.360
LIAM: It used to be just blunt weapons for clerics, wasn't it?

03:05:35.360 --> 03:05:37.700
MATT: That's the older version, they've changed a few things.

03:05:37.700 --> 03:05:38.970
They don't do it too often. Let me double-check.

03:05:38.970 --> 03:05:42.990
Cleric has access to all simple weapons.

03:05:47.120 --> 03:05:49.920
The sword is a martial weapon so you cannot use that as a weapon.

03:05:49.920 --> 03:05:50.690
ASHLEY: That's okay.

03:05:53.060 --> 03:05:56.160
ZAC: Oh man. These donations tonight, guys.

03:05:56.160 --> 03:06:00.480
MATT: That's great. I'm glad you guys are enjoying watching our--

03:06:00.480 --> 03:06:02.190
LAURA: Me and Travis are going to cut out.

03:06:02.190 --> 03:06:03.840
MATT: -- Laura and Travis are taking off, guys.

03:06:03.840 --> 03:06:06.200
MARISHA: Bye guys, have fun in Florida!

03:06:06.200 --> 03:06:08.000
LIAM: We were so glad to have you, sister!

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:09.900
LAURA: We were so glad to be here.

03:06:11.810 --> 03:06:13.800
MARISHA: What con are you guys at?

03:06:17.100 --> 03:06:19.360
LAURA: We're at MetroCon, down in Tampa.

03:06:19.360 --> 03:06:21.530
MATT: MetroCon in Tampa. So if you guys want to go see

03:06:21.530 --> 03:06:24.000
Vex and Grog in person and you're in the Florida/Tampa area,

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:25.380
go to MetroCon this weekend and say hi.

03:06:25.380 --> 03:06:28.000
LAURA: Let's see how tired we are tomorrow.
MARISHA: MetroCon in Tampa.

03:06:29.310 --> 03:06:29.980
LIAM: Worth it.

03:06:29.980 --> 03:06:30.930
MATT: Thank you guys.

03:06:30.930 --> 03:06:31.650
MARISHA: Have fun!

03:06:33.840 --> 03:06:36.330
MATT: Thanks again for the chat that bought us dinner tonight,

03:06:36.330 --> 03:06:37.760
it was amazing and delicious.

03:06:37.760 --> 03:06:39.760
Thank you so much guys, you're amazing every week.

03:06:41.610 --> 03:06:42.740
So we're going to go to donations.

03:06:42.740 --> 03:06:43.470
ZAC: Let's get through these.

03:06:43.470 --> 03:06:46.250
MATT: Yeah, all right. Thank you guys again for --

03:06:46.250 --> 03:06:50.030
Once again, this was the recovery episode

03:06:50.030 --> 03:06:53.870
of a long, twelve-week battle through the underdark.

03:06:53.870 --> 03:06:56.450
This was interesting to come back to, I hope you enjoyed it.

03:06:56.450 --> 03:06:57.700
All right, so first, donations.
