00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.026
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:04.026 --> 00:00:07.802
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons. I think we're recording,

00:00:07.802 --> 00:00:11.294
because my camera light's not on, but
nevertheless, welcome. (laughs)

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:12.942
TRAVIS: We're totally recording.

00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:17.821
MATT: I'm pretty sure we are. Anyway guys,
welcome, we have a fantastic guest who will be

00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:22.205
joining us later this evening, but before we get
to that we have announcements to go over real

00:00:22.205 --> 00:00:26.903
fast. First and foremost, tonight's episode is
sponsored by a new sponsor, a fantastic group

00:00:26.903 --> 00:00:29.331
called Quidd! If you want to talk about that
first?

00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:35.708
SAM: Hi, guys. Vacation Sam here. Quidd is our
sponsor tonight, a fantastic new sticker app for

00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:48.552
your phone. You can check it out at bitly, that's
bit.ly/crquidd. I didn't know much about the

00:00:48.552 --> 00:00:54.544
company, but Quidd sounded vaguely British, so
little-known fact about me, I have access to the

00:00:54.544 --> 00:01:01.293
BBC archives at home, so I did some snooping and
sure enough, I found a World War II newsreel

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:07.209
transcript that talked about Quidd, so I thought I
would do a dramatic reading of it for you right

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:08.144
now.

00:01:08.144 --> 00:01:09.811
LIAM: Here we go.

00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:16.193
SAM: News from the front! This is Nigel J.
Creamhutch reporting from BBC London. March 23,

00:01:16.193 --> 00:01:20.859
1944 may be a turning point in WWII as PM
Churchill announces a new weapon in the fight

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:26.238
against those devilish Nazis. They're calling it
Quidd, a new app where you can collect stickers,

00:01:26.238 --> 00:01:31.526
cards and Funko figures on your telephone device.
Our lads on the frontlines are already using it!

00:01:31.526 --> 00:01:34.825
We spoke with Lieutenant Neville Bingham of the
Royal Navy.

00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:41.440
Right, yeah, Quidd's this free app available on
the Apple App Store and Google Play, and it's

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.651
helping us drive Hitler back to Berlin.

00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:49.909
But it's not just our Tommies. The Reds have
discovered Quidd as well! We spoke with tank

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.933
commander Ivan Bashenko.

00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:57.511
With Quidd, Russian army is strongest in world.
Morale better now with thousands of stickers to

00:01:57.511 --> 00:02:03.340
collect that can be used like emojis in messages
to your friends. Stalingrad will not fall with

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.206
these cute stickers!

00:02:05.206 --> 00:02:10.867
Why, they're even using Quidd across the pond! We
spoke with American sergeant John Smith, an

00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:12.619
American Doughboy.

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:21.692
I'm John, an American. We American GIs love to
collect stickers from brands like Rick and Morty,

00:02:21.692 --> 00:02:30.664
Bob's Burgers, Family Guy, Breaking Bad, Star
Trek, and newly announced Game of Thrones. Take

00:02:30.664 --> 00:02:33.139
that, Emperor Hirohito!

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:39.648
Well, there you have it, ladies and gents. Your
British Armed Forces and our allies will defeat

00:02:39.648 --> 00:02:46.185
the Nazis and win the Second Great War if you go
to bit.ly/crquidd and check out Quidd. Good night,

00:02:46.185 --> 00:02:48.829
good luck, and god save the queen, pip pip!

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.143
(cheering)

00:02:52.143 --> 00:02:54.382
TRAVIS: I'm so glad that's available on the BBC.

00:02:54.382 --> 00:03:00.373
SAM: Yeah, it was a weird transcript. I would have
shown the newsreel, but it was just a transcript.

00:03:00.373 --> 00:03:05.519
MATT: Fair enough. Well, thank you for the update
on that, and thank you, Quidd for sponsoring

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.384
tonight's episode. Really appreciate it.

00:03:07.384 --> 00:03:09.204
LIAM: Did they win the war?

00:03:09.204 --> 00:03:10.647
SAM: Find out next time!

00:03:10.647 --> 00:03:13.119
(laughter)

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:16.680
MATT: All righty, let's see. Do you have any merch
updates at all, Laura?

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.104
LAURA: There's stuff in the store!

00:03:19.104 --> 00:03:23.850
MATT: There you go. Perfect. Good, I like it,
thank you. The Green Ronin Campaign Guide.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.795
Pre-orders go up on Monday, guys!

00:03:26.795 --> 00:03:29.080
ALL: What!

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.264
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:03:31.264 --> 00:03:38.673
MATT: Yes, and if you get the book and the pdf, I
think the pdf is available immediately, so some of

00:03:38.673 --> 00:03:41.915
you will have access to actually read the book on
Monday.

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:43.981
LAURA: Are you so nervous, Matt?

00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:46.220
MATT: I'm so nervous. (laughs nervously)

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.193
TALIESIN: People can actually, in real time, call
us when we're wrong on our own stuff.

00:03:49.193 --> 00:03:53.509
TRAVIS: What do you mean, finally? They do that
every week.

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:56.576
MARISHA: Finally? Although you are Taliesin
Jaffe.

00:03:56.576 --> 00:03:59.794
TALIESIN: This is a level of pain I've only
dreamed of; I'm very excited.

00:03:59.794 --> 00:04:03.411
LIAM: Hey. We're so proud of you.

00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:06.920
TRAVIS: Yeah, nice job with the words and stuff.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.389
SAM: Hold on though, we haven't read it yet. What
if it's terribly written, by a child?

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.316
LAURA: We'll find out he used crayon. It's all
written in marker.

00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:17.680
MATT: Probably. Do you know how hard it is to get
crayon printed these days?

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.847
MARISHA: Only if the writers' room dropped the
ball.

00:04:21.847 --> 00:04:28.028
MATT: Well, I hope you guys enjoy it, so look
forward to that. The podcast is now episodes 11

00:04:28.028 --> 00:04:32.909
through 20, right? Up on the Apple Store. So you
can go ahead and download those, which are

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:33.793
awesome.

00:04:33.793 --> 00:04:35.695
MARISHA: Yep, Apple and Google Play.

00:04:35.695 --> 00:04:42.577
MATT: Yes. And those are the ones. Of course we'll
have Talks Machina next Tuesday at 7:00pm about

00:04:42.577 --> 00:04:46.646
this episode tonight, here on Twitch and Alpha,
7:00pm Pacific, with our fantastic host Brian

00:04:46.646 --> 00:04:50.029
Foster, so you can check that out. Wednesday Club
next week for you?

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:52.875
TALIESIN: Wednesday Club, we're talking about
Comic Con, because Comic Con is coming up, and

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:56.685
we're going to try and give you a first-timer's
guide to Comic Con: If you've never been to one,

00:04:56.685 --> 00:05:02.213
what to expect, what to do for fun, and all sorts
of things that you could see or do in San Diego.

00:05:02.213 --> 00:05:06.184
Other than us. Thank you, I was very proud of last
night.

00:05:06.184 --> 00:05:10.656
MATT: We're not having a show next week, we're
going to be at Comic Con. Yeah, we have a week

00:05:10.656 --> 00:05:15.220
off. So we'll miss you guys next week, but we do
have our Critical Role panel on Saturday at Comic

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.496
Con, it's at 10:30am in Room 6...

00:05:18.496 --> 00:05:20.665
TRAVIS: BC... E.

00:05:20.665 --> 00:05:27.094
MATT: It's a nice big room. You guys should come,
we're going to have silly questions, Q and A,

00:05:27.136 --> 00:05:30.428
conversations, stories and a lot of funness and
some cool surprises!

00:05:30.428 --> 00:05:32.736
SAM and TALIESIN: Prizes?

00:05:32.736 --> 00:05:34.021
MATT: Surprises!

00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:38.199
MARISHA: Oh yeah, we have some announcements.

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:43.465
MATT: So hopefully you guys can make it at San
Diego Comic Con. If you're going to be there we'd

00:05:43.465 --> 00:05:49.196
love to see you. And last but not least, Sagas of
Sundry: Dread. The third episode went up today.

00:05:49.196 --> 00:05:53.337
MATT and MARISHA: (perfect unison) Shit's getting
real.

00:05:53.337 --> 00:05:55.743
MATT: I'm going to marry you.

00:05:55.743 --> 00:05:59.065
(laughter)

00:05:59.065 --> 00:06:04.367
MATT: What's that? Oh that's right, and at GenCon
next month we have our live show, we mentioned it

00:06:04.367 --> 00:06:09.609
last week. Tickets are still on sale for the
general admission. We're looking forward to having

00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:11.489
you guys there, it's Friday evening.

00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:15.524
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's Friday evening, 7:30. In fact,
we got an even bigger theatre this year. The last

00:06:15.524 --> 00:06:19.193
theatre had 1,500 seats, we're like, oh, we'll
never get that many people, and it went (explosion

00:06:19.193 --> 00:06:24.445
sound). It filled up, so we got a 2,500 seat
theatre. It's massive, it's a huge party, if you

00:06:24.445 --> 00:06:31.162
didn't join us last year, you want to come to this
mayhem. It's so much fun. You don't need passes to

00:06:31.162 --> 00:06:35.304
GenCon, by the way, you don't have to have a badge
or anything for that, it's a standalone thing.

00:06:35.304 --> 00:06:39.105
There are definitely tickets still available, it's
going to be super fun.

00:06:39.105 --> 00:06:43.749
SAM: I feel like with that many people we should
have beach balls in the audience, and they can do

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:45.121
the wave.

00:06:45.121 --> 00:06:47.169
MATT: Inflatable d20s to throw out there...

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:52.393
MARISHA: (gasps) You can get them. They're on
ThinkGeek I think.

00:06:52.393 --> 00:06:54.477
MATT: This is a terrible idea.

00:06:54.477 --> 00:06:56.358
TRAVIS: It's a great idea!

00:06:56.358 --> 00:07:03.487
MATT: Anyway, without further ado, I think that
concludes our announcements, and as such, let us

00:07:03.487 --> 00:07:06.665
dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:07:06.665 --> 00:08:37.745
[dramatic music]

00:08:37.745 --> 00:08:45.135
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. So where
we left off last time. Vox Machina, having finally

00:08:45.135 --> 00:08:58.412
encountered the Undying King, returned in physical
form in the Shadowfell, did battle and fled, quite

00:08:58.412 --> 00:09:03.113
unprepared for that venture, and gathered some
tidbits of information about what Vecna's plans

00:09:03.113 --> 00:09:10.642
may be. Upon returning and discovering that your
disintegrated Vax has returned through some deal

00:09:10.642 --> 00:09:17.781
he made with his patron the Raven Queen after
disintegrating, you decided to go ahead and try

00:09:17.781 --> 00:09:23.770
and gather more information about this and beseech
some of the higher powers within Exandria. Pike

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:31.425
talked to Sarenrae and was given the invitation to
come visit her in Elysium on the Island of

00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:38.217
Renewal, and upon gathering your materials and
causing a mess in Vasselheim, you got together and

00:09:38.217 --> 00:09:45.724
went to meet this fantastic Everlight. On her
island, you spoke with her. She gathered some

00:09:45.724 --> 00:09:50.044
information from you, as Vecna seemed to be
blocking at least the influence and vision from a

00:09:50.044 --> 00:09:56.259
lot of the deities, and then gave her blessing
unto Pike, transferring you over to one of the

00:09:56.259 --> 00:10:02.517
other gods that lives among the Blessed Fields of
Elysium: Pelor, the Dawnfather.

00:10:02.517 --> 00:10:10.244
You then walked through the orchards that led to
the Fortress of the Sun where he resides, spoke

00:10:10.244 --> 00:10:15.862
with some of the guardians there, and were led
into the center of the citadel, where you met, in

00:10:15.862 --> 00:10:24.003
the central throne room under the Zenith Tower,
Pelor himself. Upon exchanging information, you

00:10:24.003 --> 00:10:32.010
spoke of your need to gather the favor of certain
gods in the battles to come, and were given a

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:39.026
challenge. To step up to plate: Vex'ahlia. You
accepted the challenge and racing to the top of

00:10:39.026 --> 00:10:44.093
the tower, the zenith, before the fires could be
extinguished in the brazier that awaited you, you

00:10:44.093 --> 00:10:51.054
threw yourself into the fire, and upon the party
speaking on what it was that made Vex'ahlia such

00:10:51.054 --> 00:10:55.375
an important member of not just your team, but
your family, and gave you strength, she was imbued

00:10:55.375 --> 00:11:04.966
with a blessing of the Dawnfather himself. After
which, we left off as you exited the front of the

00:11:04.966 --> 00:11:09.495
Fortress of the Sun, stepped into the central
glade that marks the center of the

00:11:09.495 --> 00:11:16.786
seemingly endless orchards that surround this
region, and Vox Machina, what would you like to

00:11:16.786 --> 00:11:17.843
do?

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:19.669
TRAVIS: Eat all of the fruit.

00:11:19.669 --> 00:11:20.924
LAURA: No.

00:11:20.924 --> 00:11:24.798
TRAVIS: It was really good. It was just fruit, by
the way. Like I said.

00:11:24.798 --> 00:11:28.848
SAM: We're still in heaven right now?

00:11:28.848 --> 00:11:30.753
LAURA: We're still in Elysium.

00:11:30.753 --> 00:11:32.872
TALIESIN: It's not quite heaven.

00:11:32.872 --> 00:11:42.389
TRAVIS: Are there any other gods here that we
should curry favor with? For? Of?

00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:45.776
LAURA: Are there any more gods here? Not that we
know of.

00:11:45.776 --> 00:11:47.207
SAM: We forgot to ask.

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:48.776
TRAVIS: Did we?

00:11:48.776 --> 00:11:51.107
LAURA: Yeah. I don't think Ioun is here.

00:11:51.107 --> 00:11:57.723
MATT: You're looking at the series of the Sun Tree
cousins, one of which you've met, scattered

00:11:57.723 --> 00:12:00.367
amongst this glade surrounding the central
citadel.

00:12:00.367 --> 00:12:02.210
MARISHA: What a douche.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.137
SAM: No other people? Guards? Nothing.

00:12:05.137 --> 00:12:12.598
MATT: You have the guards behind you, the large
planetar and deva entities that stand there,

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:17.002
armored in their golden plate, after ushering you
out, are standing guard.

00:12:17.002 --> 00:12:19.054
LAURA: Maybe we can ask them.

00:12:19.054 --> 00:12:22.722
SAM: Sure. I'll go up to one and say, hello there,
big fellow.

00:12:22.722 --> 00:12:29.977
MATT: Standing a full ten feet taller than you,
practically, the wings slightly bent, the large

00:12:29.977 --> 00:12:34.598
planar entity kneels down. "Hello."

00:12:34.598 --> 00:12:43.894
SAM: Hello. Vacation Scanlan here. Couple
questions. By the way, was he one of the ones who

00:12:43.894 --> 00:12:45.762
fought in there?

00:12:45.762 --> 00:12:48.124
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:12:48.124 --> 00:12:52.290
SAM: Oh. Do they all look alike? 17 plus one.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:56.800
MATT: Hard to tell. You didn't pay a lot of
attention.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:06.163
SAM: Okay. Hey, just wondering, a few questions.
A: How does one get out of here? Is there a door

00:13:06.163 --> 00:13:07.975
to another plane?

00:13:07.975 --> 00:13:11.843
MATT: "I imagine the same way you came in."

00:13:11.843 --> 00:13:21.982
SAM: A god brought us here. All right, cool.
Number two: Are there any other like your

00:13:21.982 --> 00:13:27.946
Dawnfather around here? Any other gods in the
area?

00:13:27.946 --> 00:13:34.823
MATT: "Across Elysium, there are two deities that
call it home: the Dawnfather and the Everlight."

00:13:34.823 --> 00:13:42.436
SAM: So we covered our bases. Out of curiosity:
What are you called?

00:13:42.436 --> 00:13:49.754
MATT: He looks very closely, and you get sense
that part of its nature is scanning through you;

00:13:49.754 --> 00:13:56.127
it's getting a sense and a read of you as an
individual, and it says, "No one you need to worry

00:13:56.127 --> 00:14:01.888
"about." Stands up and then takes two steps back
(heavy footfalls) into place and looks straight

00:14:01.888 --> 00:14:03.496
ahead.

00:14:03.496 --> 00:14:06.913
MARISHA: Scanlan, you should remember that line,
that's a good one.

00:14:06.913 --> 00:14:14.772
SAM: Yeah. I already forgot it. I'm too
intimidated. Was it no one or something? I don't

00:14:14.772 --> 00:14:18.043
know. Well, good speaking to you.

00:14:18.043 --> 00:14:21.122
MATT: Still looks out. Doesn't respond.

00:14:21.122 --> 00:14:26.764
SAM: Well, how do we get out of here? Can she take
us home?

00:14:26.764 --> 00:14:27.932
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:14:27.932 --> 00:14:29.641
LIAM: She does on the daily.

00:14:29.641 --> 00:14:36.450
SAM: I know, but I don't know. They talked about
some sort of a gate that keeps the gods out and

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.113
the bad gods in.

00:14:38.113 --> 00:14:44.636
MATT: To remind you of what happened last time.
There was talking about possibly... or at least

00:14:44.636 --> 00:14:49.860
there was the Trammel, the Prime Trammels that
were used previously to seal the Chained Oblivion,

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:58.714
Tharizdun, and that the orchestrator, the designer
of those was Ioun, the Knowing Goddess. Ioun,

00:14:58.714 --> 00:15:05.880
however, has sealed herself away, being a wounded
god, long recovering, and the only information

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:14.048
that Pelor has of where she hid herself, the key,
essentially, is not an object but a person. You're

00:15:14.048 --> 00:15:24.681
seeking an individual, of which you were given a
solar light map of a single small home in a forest

00:15:24.681 --> 00:15:29.126
ravine not far from a place that you've noticed
was near the Pools of Wittebak, which is in the

00:15:29.126 --> 00:15:30.956
Cliffkeep Mountains.

00:15:30.956 --> 00:15:34.281
SAM: Yeah, but there was also a mention of some
Divine Gate that keeps people from--

00:15:34.354 --> 00:15:39.563
MATT: Well, the Divine Gate is a known existing
entity. It's essentially a large gate that

00:15:39.563 --> 00:15:42.001
prevents the gods from returning to the Prime
Material Plane.

00:15:42.001 --> 00:15:46.766
LIAM: It's like a metaphysical screen door that
keeps flies out.

00:15:46.766 --> 00:15:49.055
LAURA: So the gods can't get in and out.

00:15:49.055 --> 00:15:50.373
SAM: Sure, sure.

00:15:50.373 --> 00:15:57.311
MARISHA: Yeah, the Prime Trammel. Which we now
have to get--

00:15:57.311 --> 00:16:02.692
LAURA: We have to get near the the Cliffkeep
Range, near the Pools of Wittebak, is where we

00:16:02.692 --> 00:16:04.016
need to go.

00:16:04.016 --> 00:16:10.635
MARISHA: And the Cliffkeep is not too far from
Whitestone?

00:16:10.635 --> 00:16:15.937
MATT: Cliffkeep Mountains go across a lot of the
northern side of Tal'Dorei, from what you're

00:16:15.937 --> 00:16:25.828
familiar with. Like, we're talking Kraghammer to
Gatshadow to the Jorenn Village. There's a lot of

00:16:25.828 --> 00:16:30.875
things. It's like a big horizontal mountain range
that caps the top part of the continent.

00:16:30.875 --> 00:16:33.899
MARISHA: Do I recognize the city that I can get us
to that's close?

00:16:33.899 --> 00:16:36.768
MATT: Fort Daxio or Kraghammer.

00:16:36.768 --> 00:16:41.524
SAM: Haven't been to Kraghammer for a while,
although Daxio might be worth a check.

00:16:41.524 --> 00:16:46.368
TALIESIN: What's closest to the pools?

00:16:46.368 --> 00:16:51.065
MATT: Probably Terrah or the Pools of Wittebak.
Those are the two that are closest.

00:16:51.065 --> 00:16:52.360
LAURA: What is Terrah?

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.664
MARISHA: My home.

00:16:53.664 --> 00:16:55.379
MATT: Terrah's not your home.

00:16:55.379 --> 00:17:01.824
MARISHA: Sorry. Sorry, Terrah is the Earth
Ashari.

00:17:01.824 --> 00:17:03.492
SAM: My other home, summer home.

00:17:03.492 --> 00:17:05.496
MATT: The home away from home.

00:17:05.496 --> 00:17:14.607
LIAM: Can you also remind me where my Vecdar made
me feel Vecna-- where on the Prime Material

00:17:14.607 --> 00:17:16.860
Plane?

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:19.120
MATT: Yes. Oh, where?

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.018
LIAM: Yeah, we talked about it, but I can't
remember.

00:17:21.018 --> 00:17:30.084
MATT: You did, yes. It seemed to be hundreds of
miles northwest of Vasselheim. You didn't sense

00:17:30.084 --> 00:17:34.381
any movement, but you knew the general direction
and distance.

00:17:34.381 --> 00:17:35.715
LIAM: And that was yesterday.

00:17:35.715 --> 00:17:37.039
MATT: Correct.

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:38.755
LAURA: Teacher?

00:17:38.755 --> 00:17:40.097
MATT: Yes, Laura?

00:17:40.097 --> 00:17:48.142
LAURA: I was excited the last game and somehow
have misplaced my Pelor champion piece of paper.

00:17:48.142 --> 00:17:50.478
LIAM: Oh, she doesn't get to have it now. That's
how that works.

00:17:50.478 --> 00:17:53.549
LAURA: I don't know how it happened! It's not with
my stuffs.

00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:57.290
MATT: That's okay, I remember what it does, and if
you decide to use it--

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.488
LAURA: You'll tell me? Okay.

00:17:59.488 --> 00:18:01.614
MATT: I won't tell you. You tell me you want to
use it.

00:18:01.614 --> 00:18:07.663
LAURA: Oh shit, okay. I'm sorry. I had it, and
it's not here.

00:18:07.663 --> 00:18:10.987
TALIESIN: It's weird how he's so nice and yet it
still feels like you are in so much trouble.

00:18:10.987 --> 00:18:14.362
LAURA: I'm in a lot of trouble, you guys.

00:18:14.362 --> 00:18:16.809
LIAM: He's calm, but indifferent. Like the
Dawnfather.

00:18:16.809 --> 00:18:23.987
MATT: All right, so what would you like to do?

00:18:23.987 --> 00:18:26.103
TRAVIS: Yeah, what would we like to do?

00:18:26.103 --> 00:18:30.047
MARISHA: Should we go to Terrah? Check in with
them, I guess, while we're there?

00:18:30.047 --> 00:18:31.630
TALIESIN: Seems prudent.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:33.366
MARISHA: And talk to Pa'tice.

00:18:33.366 --> 00:18:34.694
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:18:34.694 --> 00:18:38.138
MARISHA: All right. We ready to go?

00:18:38.138 --> 00:18:43.108
TALIESIN: I'm very ready to go. This is lovely and
everything, but I've had my fill.

00:18:43.108 --> 00:18:48.122
MARISHA: I will burn my 8th-level spell slot to
Plane Shift us to Terrah.

00:18:48.122 --> 00:18:50.020
MATT: To Terrah, all righty.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.634
MARISHA: Mind the gap.

00:18:51.634 --> 00:18:52.840
TALIESIN: What gap?

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.520
MARISHA: Don't worry about it.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.076
TRAVIS: No effects from eating that fruit, right?

00:18:57.076 --> 00:19:01.718
MATT: No, you didn't sense any effects from that
fruit, at the moment.

00:19:01.718 --> 00:19:03.804
TRAVIS: Didn't remove a curse or anything?

00:19:03.804 --> 00:19:07.290
MATT: No, you didn't. Nothing really caught you up
to speed, in that.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:10.300
LAURA: Are we by those fruit trees again?

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:16.392
MATT: There are no fruit-bearing trees directly
near you. The Sun Trees are around you. Further in

00:19:16.392 --> 00:19:23.609
they do, yes. All righty. Bringing up my notes on
Terrah, since that's where you're going.

00:19:23.609 --> 00:19:27.671
MARISHA: Yeah, I should probably--

00:19:27.671 --> 00:19:37.313
LAURA: I'm so confused about the order of things.
If we go to Ioun, and we don't have everything we

00:19:37.313 --> 00:19:46.153
need for this Prime Trammel, are we fucked? I know
we need godly power in order to imbue them, right?

00:19:46.153 --> 00:19:47.592
Or something?

00:19:47.592 --> 00:19:52.231
LIAM: Either here or soon we need to sit and work
this out.

00:19:52.231 --> 00:19:56.021
SAM: What do we need to bring into the trammel?

00:19:56.021 --> 00:20:04.767
LAURA: Well, Pelor gave me this. Snap, snap, snap,
zip. This. It's a stone and it's supposed to be

00:20:04.767 --> 00:20:05.935
strong enough to--

00:20:05.935 --> 00:20:07.283
LIAM: Power the trammel?

00:20:07.283 --> 00:20:09.614
LAURA: Part of it? Not all of it.

00:20:09.614 --> 00:20:15.118
MARISHA: We need to collect more, though, right? We
have to get like eight or something.

00:20:15.118 --> 00:20:16.760
SAM: Wait, it said that?

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.497
MATT: You weren't given any indication as to how
many you needed.

00:20:19.497 --> 00:20:22.319
LAURA: But it did seem like this is not enough.

00:20:22.319 --> 00:20:27.482
MARISHA: Oh no, wait, Ioun was healing for eight
centuries. That's where I got that number. Sorry.

00:20:27.482 --> 00:20:32.846
TRAVIS: I could do it, too. Five. Five stones of
power.

00:20:32.846 --> 00:20:40.238
MATT: All right, so as you complete your spell,
Keyleth, you step through the base of the nearest

00:20:40.238 --> 00:20:43.976
tree, possibly the same one you spoke with earlier
if you want to be a dick about it.

00:20:43.976 --> 00:20:53.709
MARISHA: Oh yeah! Let's walk through that asshole.
That sounds worse for us. But fuck it.

00:20:53.709 --> 00:21:02.201
MATT: All right, you aggressively stampede through
the center of this one tree and emerge on the

00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:12.177
other side from one of the surrounding trees on
the Terrah village. There are a number of these

00:21:12.177 --> 00:21:20.474
pseudo-petrified or dried-out large-trunk trees
that seem to have slowly died off from the heavy

00:21:20.474 --> 00:21:25.370
tectonic shifts and small quakes that happen in
this area, that have made a lot of the land unable

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:31.140
to support large forms of plant life, or at least the
trees that used to exist here. So you step out and

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:36.545
emerge from the exterior of the village as it
domes down into this small crater that you recall

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:42.338
seeing before, where most of the village inhabits the
central portion, and the village is there before

00:21:42.489 --> 00:21:43.357
you.

00:21:43.357 --> 00:21:45.678
MARISHA: What were the shard things called again?

00:21:45.829 --> 00:21:47.332
MATT: The shard things?

00:21:47.332 --> 00:21:49.585
MARISHA: The things we need to collect?

00:21:49.585 --> 00:21:58.377
MATT: There wasn't really a name for them more
than they're small pieces of essence of the

00:21:58.377 --> 00:21:59.688
deity.

00:21:59.688 --> 00:22:02.590
MARISHA: So we need pieces of god.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:08.925
LIAM: Does the little seed of light given to my
sister look anything like the little seed that

00:22:08.925 --> 00:22:14.715
Scanlan and Vax saw from riding the shadow
creature in the sky?

00:22:14.715 --> 00:22:21.393
MATT: No. In a sense that it's a small source
of power of some kind, but what you saw there was

00:22:21.393 --> 00:22:25.875
maybe about that large on the platform. What she
has is bead size.

00:22:25.875 --> 00:22:37.011
LAURA: Is it this size? Or this size?

00:22:37.011 --> 00:22:42.446
MATT: Comparable to each. So you stand outside of
Terrah. What are you doing?

00:22:42.446 --> 00:22:46.201
SAM: What time of day is it? How tired are we?

00:22:46.201 --> 00:22:56.990
MATT: Based on when you left, it would still be
probably-- well, you were over in Vasselheim, which

00:22:56.990 --> 00:23:04.186
means it's getting dark, actually. I'd say with
the way the sun has passed through the sky now,

00:23:04.186 --> 00:23:08.926
you've just gotten past dusk. There's still
light in the sky, but it's going from oranges to

00:23:08.926 --> 00:23:15.813
purples to dark blues on the horizon, and you can
see hints of firelight, torchlight and candlelight

00:23:15.813 --> 00:23:18.546
from within the actual city below.

00:23:18.546 --> 00:23:22.870
SAM: Well, what are we going to need on this trip?
Maybe we should get whatever supplies we need. Is

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:26.145
it far? Are we going to become gas?

00:23:26.145 --> 00:23:28.143
TRAVIS: Are we going underground?

00:23:28.143 --> 00:23:29.826
MARISHA: Oh, to Terrah?

00:23:29.826 --> 00:23:35.378
SAM: No, we'e in Terrah. But the next day, we're
going to the--

00:23:35.378 --> 00:23:37.050
TALIESIN: To the pools.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:43.679
MARISHA: Do we want to stay the night here, then? I
can't mist us right now. I'm tapped out. Camp

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:44.837
here.

00:23:44.837 --> 00:23:49.381
LAURA: Vax? Can you sense Vecna? Is he still in
the same place?

00:23:49.381 --> 00:23:51.418
LIAM: I can sense him?

00:23:51.418 --> 00:23:56.139
MATT: You can sense him. He is, from your current
location, thousands of miles from you.

00:23:56.139 --> 00:23:58.293
LAURA: Oh, hard to tell, then?

00:23:58.293 --> 00:24:04.090
LIAM: He's still really shitty, though.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:08.281
MATT: Yeah, very heavy west-northwest direction
from you, currently.

00:24:08.281 --> 00:24:15.826
SAM: Well, sleep? Do we need to get any intel on
where these pools are? Do we need anything?

00:24:15.826 --> 00:24:19.532
LAURA: We should maybe talk to the people of
Terrah? It's not that late.

00:24:19.532 --> 00:24:25.322
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go. They have a spare room
for us.

00:24:25.322 --> 00:24:28.772
TRAVIS: Are you the leader of all the people?

00:24:28.772 --> 00:24:32.249
MARISHA: I'm the leader of the Air Ashari and the
Voice of the Tempest.

00:24:32.249 --> 00:24:36.092
TRAVIS: Is that a yes or a no? You don't have to
fucking brag.

00:24:36.092 --> 00:24:41.187
MARISHA: No, there's four of us, and I'm
one of the four.

00:24:41.187 --> 00:24:43.204
SAM: Do you know the one who lives here?

00:24:43.204 --> 00:24:44.248
MARISHA: I do.

00:24:44.248 --> 00:24:46.598
SAM: Then let's go see him or her. Or they.

00:24:46.598 --> 00:24:51.285
MARISHA: No, we can just go, like I was saying
five minutes ago. Let's just go.

00:24:51.285 --> 00:24:58.848
MATT: All right. So as you walk down into the
village, a number of the guardians step out

00:24:58.848 --> 00:25:04.019
quickly, seeing an approaching party, however,
recognizing Keyleth and her station immediately,

00:25:04.019 --> 00:25:07.059
turn into an escort that leads you to the center
portion of the village.

00:25:07.059 --> 00:25:08.657
MARISHA: I request Pa'tice.

00:25:08.657 --> 00:25:14.810
MATT: Quickly enough, they go and retrieve
Pa'tice. You see the elderly form of the leader

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:23.636
you've met before step out, the graying hair, the
weathered dark skin tones, the long greens and

00:25:23.636 --> 00:25:29.800
brown leathers that drape off, showing hints of
the knees and lower feet, the large walking staff

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:35.107
that he carries at his side as he approaches and
the headdress that seems to be a combination of

00:25:35.107 --> 00:25:45.115
thick twines and shale shards that have been woven
in, steps forward. "Keyleth. An unexpected visit,

00:25:45.115 --> 00:25:46.563
"most definitely."

00:25:46.563 --> 00:25:47.856
MARISHA: Kaitiaki.

00:25:47.856 --> 00:25:48.973
MATT: "Kaitiaki."

00:25:48.973 --> 00:25:54.800
MARISHA: Pa'tice, I am so sorry for the late
intrusion. We've just gotten back from the plane

00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:01.302
of Elysium, so we're a little tired. Yeah, we're
fighting a god right now, well, more of like a

00:26:01.302 --> 00:26:07.263
demi-god, so have you heard of Vecna? Sorry, I'm
probably getting ahead of myself. Do you have any

00:26:07.263 --> 00:26:09.468
food? Let's talk over dinner.

00:26:09.468 --> 00:26:13.333
MATT: "We have food, yes. You are guests of
Terrah. Please, we will provide whatever you

00:26:13.333 --> 00:26:19.493
"require. Come, provide them a meal!" And he puts
his hand out and they run off quickly.

00:26:19.493 --> 00:26:23.802
TALIESIN: I like that people just feed us. We show up,
and there's food.

00:26:23.802 --> 00:26:25.960
SAM: You've been used to that your whole life.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.511
TALIESIN: Not at home.

00:26:27.511 --> 00:26:30.640
SAM: I have to sing for dinner. You just say--

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.934
TALIESIN: Have you ever tried not singing for
dinner?

00:26:32.934 --> 00:26:34.295
SAM: Maybe I'll get more food.

00:26:34.295 --> 00:26:35.937
TALIESIN: You might!

00:26:35.937 --> 00:26:45.813
LIAM: You did have one year-ish where you were on
the skids. You did your Prince and the Pauper bit

00:26:45.813 --> 00:26:47.264
for a little bit.

00:26:47.264 --> 00:26:52.450
TALIESIN: It's a big vague, but yes. I was on a
boat for quite a while.

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:55.455
TRAVIS: Oh my god, can we eat food?

00:26:55.455 --> 00:27:00.225
(laughter)

00:27:00.225 --> 00:27:05.882
MATT: And quick as that, you guys make your way
down. It's a modest meal, but it's a meal

00:27:05.882 --> 00:27:12.986
nonetheless. Mostly hunted creatures of the local
mountainside, some dried beets and root.

00:27:12.986 --> 00:27:15.186
MARISHA: We always try to source locally.

00:27:15.186 --> 00:27:17.020
TALIESIN: Charmingly provincial.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.587
MATT: (laughs)

00:27:18.587 --> 00:27:22.428
LAURA: Keyleth, perhaps you should let your people
know that the world is in danger.

00:27:22.428 --> 00:27:28.319
MARISHA: So the world's in danger, as she said--

00:27:28.319 --> 00:27:33.942
SAM: The waiter is like, what?

00:27:33.942 --> 00:27:36.925
LIAM: Runs out the door.

00:27:36.925 --> 00:27:40.041
MARISHA: Aw shit! I just induced panic.

00:27:40.041 --> 00:27:48.793
MATT: Pa'tice, who's sat down with you, says
quickly, "We have been made aware via the other

00:27:48.793 --> 00:27:55.489
"Ashari that there is some danger possibly coming.
We are awaiting word of what to do other than keep

00:27:55.489 --> 00:28:01.378
"ourselves in a defensive position. We have to
guard the rift, of course. But should there be a

00:28:01.378 --> 00:28:11.202
"call to action, we'll do what we can. I'm
unfamiliar with this Vecna, but whatever you plan,

00:28:11.202 --> 00:28:12.921
"please be careful."

00:28:12.921 --> 00:28:22.564
MARISHA: (sighs) Okay. More than anything, I think
I would want you all to be relief for the

00:28:22.564 --> 00:28:28.866
surrounding area and surrounding villages if
anything disastrous were to happen. I know you

00:28:28.866 --> 00:28:33.306
have to guard the rift and that is insanely
important and especially right now with someone

00:28:33.306 --> 00:28:40.122
like Vecna who could potentially abuse that. But
if anything were to happen, I don't know if you

00:28:40.122 --> 00:28:44.760
could house extra people during a disaster.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:55.223
MATT: "We are quite good at assembling makeshift
and temporary lodging. The rock is our friend, if

00:28:55.223 --> 00:28:56.249
"you will."

00:28:56.249 --> 00:28:58.294
MARISHA: Yeah, that's more, I think, what we would
need.

00:28:58.294 --> 00:29:00.324
MATT: "Of course, of course! Not a worry."

00:29:00.324 --> 00:29:07.025
MARISHA: Currently, Vecna is just north of Vasselheim,
close to Pyrah.

00:29:07.025 --> 00:29:11.049
MATT: "Have you asked Pyrah for aid, as well?"

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:15.311
MARISHA: They've also been put on alert, but we
have not personally been there yet since this has

00:29:15.311 --> 00:29:16.317
happened.

00:29:16.317 --> 00:29:22.464
MATT: "Well. Good. They're closer. But we're happy
to help if we can."

00:29:22.464 --> 00:29:24.672
MARISHA: Yeah. Thank you.

00:29:24.672 --> 00:29:29.432
LAURA: Things are happening very quickly. We just
happened here first.

00:29:29.432 --> 00:29:33.298
MATT: "We're happy to help. Where are you off
to?"

00:29:33.298 --> 00:29:36.626
SAM: The Pools of Wittebak.

00:29:36.626 --> 00:29:39.860
MATT: "What brings you towards the Pools of
Wittebak?"

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.350
SAM: You know this place?

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:47.194
MATT: "It is a series of poisoned wells and
hulking, stupid giants."

00:29:47.194 --> 00:29:49.035
SAM: Hulking, stupid giants?

00:29:49.035 --> 00:29:51.767
LAURA: Giants? At the pools?

00:29:51.767 --> 00:29:53.230
MATT: "Yes."

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.283
LAURA: I thought it was something about gnomes
there.

00:29:55.283 --> 00:29:56.700
MATT: "It was once."

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:57.978
SAM: They grew.

00:29:57.978 --> 00:30:00.975
(laughter)

00:30:00.975 --> 00:30:03.135
LAURA: Is that something you can do, Scanlan?

00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:05.048
SAM: I don't know. (laughs)

00:30:05.048 --> 00:30:15.377
MATT: "They're geothermic large puddles across the
mountainside. Various minerals being lifted up

00:30:15.377 --> 00:30:21.141
"from the deep waters beneath the mountain. Heated,
bubbling, boiling, steaming. But the giants moved

00:30:21.141 --> 00:30:29.829
"in hundreds of years ago, stomped around, and
ended up filling the entire subterranean gnomish

00:30:29.829 --> 00:30:34.365
"city of Wittebak with fumes and poison. Killed
most of them, and the rest fled to Kraghammer."

00:30:34.365 --> 00:30:37.970
LIAM: Do you all ever broach the area or do you
just stay clear of it?

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:41.407
MATT: "Best to avoid, we have our own business to
deal with. And it's 100 miles from here. It's not

00:30:41.407 --> 00:30:42.850
"much of an issue."

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:44.785
TALIESIN: And the pools are naturally poisonous?

00:30:44.785 --> 00:30:51.225
MATT: "Well, some are toxic, some are not, but
since the giants moved in and ruptured some of the

00:30:51.225 --> 00:30:55.454
"natural formations, some of them have grown toxic
or acidic, yes."

00:30:55.454 --> 00:30:59.376
MARISHA: Do you know if people still try to live
there? We're looking for someone.

00:30:59.376 --> 00:31:02.912
MATT: "If they are, they're foolish."

00:31:02.912 --> 00:31:04.362
MARISHA: Okay.

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:06.425
TALIESIN: That's our kind of people.

00:31:06.425 --> 00:31:08.639
LAURA: Maybe the person we're looking for is a
giant.

00:31:08.639 --> 00:31:09.838
MARISHA: Maybe.

00:31:09.838 --> 00:31:15.948
SAM: Do you know what type of giant? We've seen a
few types of giants. Do you know their make and

00:31:15.948 --> 00:31:16.997
model?

00:31:16.997 --> 00:31:21.724
MATT: "The dumbest. Hill giants."

00:31:21.724 --> 00:31:23.005
LAURA: Hill giants.

00:31:23.005 --> 00:31:24.178
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:31:24.178 --> 00:31:28.506
MATT: "Easy to outsmart, difficult to outrun.
They'll eat anything, even small little gnomes."

00:31:28.506 --> 00:31:31.012
LAURA: Seems like they ate a lot of them.

00:31:31.012 --> 00:31:32.777
SAM: (laughing) I guess so.

00:31:32.777 --> 00:31:41.590
LAURA: Pasty, I have a question. Do you know
anything about Ioun?

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:45.159
MATT: "I know of the name."

00:31:45.159 --> 00:31:46.859
LAURA: But not much.

00:31:46.859 --> 00:31:50.480
MATT: "We're not the most devoted people."

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.544
LAURA: I know.

00:31:51.544 --> 00:31:55.425
MARISHA: I saw that.

00:31:55.425 --> 00:31:58.725
(laughter)

00:31:58.725 --> 00:32:01.410
MATT: "I can't imagine I'd have any information
you wouldn't."

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:03.255
LAURA: Okay. Just checking.

00:32:03.255 --> 00:32:04.862
MATT: "My apologies."

00:32:04.862 --> 00:32:08.166
LAURA: This food is really good.

00:32:08.166 --> 00:32:11.539
MATT: "Yes! Enjoy your meal!" And he gets up and
walks away.

00:32:11.539 --> 00:32:15.439
TALIESIN: He was so officious.

00:32:15.439 --> 00:32:20.526
LAURA: I thought we were walking into a fucking
lake with gnomes living there. I didn't realize we

00:32:20.526 --> 00:32:22.356
were going to fight giants.

00:32:22.356 --> 00:32:24.683
TRAVIS: This got so much better all of a sudden.

00:32:24.683 --> 00:32:27.827
TALIESIN: If it were easy, it really wouldn't be
us, would it?

00:32:27.827 --> 00:32:34.113
MARISHA: So the question is, is there actually
someone of some minor intelligence living there

00:32:34.113 --> 00:32:39.528
that is this magical key, or did that person get
eaten by a giant?

00:32:39.528 --> 00:32:47.696
TALIESIN: I cannot believe I'm about to say this.
I'm inclined to believe the god. They're in the

00:32:47.696 --> 00:32:52.944
position where trying to trick us out of leaving
is not necessary. They could've just told us to

00:32:52.944 --> 00:32:56.924
leave and be done with it. That information just
wouldn't suit them, I don't think.

00:32:56.924 --> 00:33:01.123
MARISHA: I'm not saying it's bad information, I'm
just wondering who the key is.

00:33:01.123 --> 00:33:09.293
LAURA: It's possible the key is now inside of a
giant's stomach. In which case, it still would

00:33:09.293 --> 00:33:11.956
be inside of someone. Just a different someone.

00:33:11.956 --> 00:33:15.945
MARISHA: Yeah. Maybe they're still living inside.
Maybe it's like a Moby Dick situation.

00:33:15.945 --> 00:33:23.428
MATT: You do recall the map that was shown to you
by the Dawnfather Pelor. It was adjacent to the

00:33:23.428 --> 00:33:28.907
pools, not actually in the Pools of Wittebak. It
was within a forest, and was a home.

00:33:28.907 --> 00:33:36.372
LAURA: Oh! I remember it now! It was a home
inside. Oh, I drew a little map of it. Yep, that's

00:33:36.372 --> 00:33:44.020
it. Yes, it's adjacent to the pools, but there's a
home in a forest. Did you like it? That's what my

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.486
map was.

00:33:45.486 --> 00:33:50.370
MARISHA: Can we theoretically just mist over
everywhere?

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:56.274
LAURA: I mean and look out for a home in the
forest? We'll have to fly pretty low. I'm assuming

00:33:56.274 --> 00:33:59.487
the home is going to be covered by treetop.

00:33:59.487 --> 00:34:06.268
TRAVIS: We never travel traditionally anymore. I'm
just saying, I miss the romantic aspects of

00:34:06.268 --> 00:34:12.960
traveling the countryside. It's like fast forward,
immediate gratification, fucking you know.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.575
SAM: The Dawnfather said we must hurry or else the
world will end.

00:34:16.575 --> 00:34:25.402
LAURA: It's very far. We could Misty Step to the
forest and then walk in the forest?

00:34:25.402 --> 00:34:28.151
TRAVIS: Why are you fucking talking to me like I'm
a child?

00:34:28.151 --> 00:34:29.492
LAURA: No reason, darling.

00:34:29.492 --> 00:34:31.698
TRAVIS: Okay. That would-- okay.

00:34:31.698 --> 00:34:36.606
(laughter)

00:34:36.606 --> 00:34:47.410
LIAM: Once this is all done, Grog, you and I will
go on a long trek together.

00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:50.739
TRAVIS: Yeah? Yeah. I dig that.

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:55.766
LAURA: Don't be dark and creepy and make it sound
like you're being nice. I know you're being dark

00:34:55.766 --> 00:34:57.241
and creepy right now.

00:34:57.241 --> 00:35:02.817
TRAVIS: Oh, hey. Don't get after my camping
partner like that, all right? Shit. Chill.

00:35:02.817 --> 00:35:05.778
LIAM: Can't predict this one.

00:35:05.778 --> 00:35:08.494
TRAVIS: No marshmallows for this witch.

00:35:08.494 --> 00:35:12.374
MARISHA: It is a little weird to be making
promises, though.

00:35:12.374 --> 00:35:21.996
TALIESIN: Well, on that chipper little side note, I
think we should turn in for the evening.

00:35:21.996 --> 00:35:25.444
SAM: Yes, do we have lodging?

00:35:25.444 --> 00:35:31.323
MATT: Lodging is provided for you. They have a
number of various guest tents and small buildings

00:35:31.323 --> 00:35:37.886
that provide you with space. Not the highest of
quality of places you've slept in, probably, and

00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:42.719
if you wanted to provide your mansion instead,
you're welcome to, but ample food, quiet sleep.

00:35:42.719 --> 00:35:51.738
It's a comfortable evening's rest. You all find
yourselves through the evening. As you sleep, and

00:35:51.738 --> 00:35:55.651
having this being the first time many of you
have slept in Terrah, it takes you a while. There is

00:35:55.731 --> 00:36:01.620
just a general low hum or vibration to the
ground that you sleep on. You get the sense it's

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:09.922
probably proximity to the Rift, but there is this
slow, perpetual (rumbling). It's like a weird, low

00:36:09.922 --> 00:36:15.405
rumble. Like a heavy bass sound that never seems
to dissipate that you hadn't noticed until you

00:36:15.405 --> 00:36:22.038
were trying to quietly sleep. But it's not
off-putting and within ten or 15 minutes, it

00:36:22.038 --> 00:36:27.251
actually almost helps to lull you to rest. You all
come to in the morning, gather your supplies, and

00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:30.070
are preparing for the next leg of your journey.
What do you wish to do?

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:34.392
TRAVIS: Could I attune, either before I go to
sleep or when I wake up, to the Dwarven Thrower

00:36:34.392 --> 00:36:36.109
instead of the Bloodaxe?

00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:40.047
MATT: You may. All right. Any other attunements,
anyone wishes to--

00:36:40.047 --> 00:36:42.524
LIAM: I'll set the Deathwalker's Ward to acid.

00:36:42.524 --> 00:36:44.290
MATT: All right, to acid. Boom.

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:48.914
LAURA: Before everyone else gets up, can I go find
where Vax is sleeping?

00:36:48.914 --> 00:36:50.866
MATT: You may.

00:36:50.866 --> 00:36:58.969
LAURA: This is a tent. What do I do? Do I knock?
Do I shake it? I'm not sure. Scratch?

00:36:58.969 --> 00:37:06.511
MATT: They're lodging made from large pieces of
shale and rock, jammed into a somewhat triangular

00:37:06.511 --> 00:37:10.374
pattern to form an earth yurt, if you will.

00:37:10.374 --> 00:37:14.727
LAURA: Oi. Vax. Are you naked?

00:37:14.727 --> 00:37:16.313
LIAM: Yes.

00:37:16.313 --> 00:37:20.550
LAURA: Put some clothes on, then. Jesus. Keyleth,
sorry.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:30.452
MARISHA: Keyleth opens the shamble door first with
a little earth movement. I'm dressed. Yeah. I'm

00:37:30.452 --> 00:37:32.012
not like that.

00:37:32.012 --> 00:37:35.032
LAURA: You don't sleep naked?

00:37:35.032 --> 00:37:38.011
MARISHA: I'm going to go get coffee.

00:37:38.011 --> 00:37:39.322
LAURA: Okay.

00:37:39.322 --> 00:37:43.759
MATT: (laughs) Keyleth darts off in the distance
and the two of you are left within the tent.

00:37:43.759 --> 00:37:46.880
LAURA: Are you decent?

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.607
LIAM: Yes.

00:37:48.607 --> 00:37:50.330
LAURA: I'm coming in.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:52.230
LIAM: I'm still naked.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:59.950
LAURA: Ugh, come on! So fucking weird. (groans) I
turn my back to him.

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:04.324
LIAM: I start putting on the rest of my armor.

00:38:04.324 --> 00:38:06.628
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

00:38:06.628 --> 00:38:10.522
LAURA: Can I ask you a question? Well, I'm going
to.

00:38:10.522 --> 00:38:11.973
LIAM: Of course you can.

00:38:11.973 --> 00:38:18.204
LAURA: I look down at my feet. Why didn't you ever
try to take these back?

00:38:18.204 --> 00:38:28.651
LIAM: Well, they're going to be yours, anyway.

00:38:28.651 --> 00:38:33.928
LAURA: Oh, Jesus. You know, the only reason I
do things is that I take great joy in irritating

00:38:33.928 --> 00:38:43.986
you. If you don't show irritation, it makes it not
worth it. (sighs) Can I turn around now? I'm

00:38:43.986 --> 00:38:45.200
turning around.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.750
LIAM: I am covered.

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:55.739
LAURA: Good. Why are you so calm? You're so calm
and confident now. It's weird.

00:38:55.739 --> 00:39:00.332
LIAM: I mean, I'm on bonus time.

00:39:00.332 --> 00:39:02.814
LAURA: Is he still cold?

00:39:02.814 --> 00:39:09.281
MATT: His skin is colder than a warm body, yes.

00:39:09.281 --> 00:39:11.381
LIAM: But I'm not Bobby Drake, right?

00:39:11.381 --> 00:39:13.665
LAURA: What's his heartbeat like?

00:39:13.665 --> 00:39:17.796
MATT: (very slow heartbeat)

00:39:17.796 --> 00:39:20.388
LAURA: (groans) Jeez!

00:39:20.388 --> 00:39:22.348
TALIESIN: Wow, way to hang onto that one, Matt.

00:39:22.348 --> 00:39:26.325
LIAM: But look. (slashing noise) I mean, look.

00:39:26.325 --> 00:39:27.570
LAURA: Is there blood?

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:34.264
MATT: Yeah, he bleeds, and it's a pretty open
wound. You watch as the wound slowly seals itself

00:39:34.264 --> 00:39:35.188
up.

00:39:35.188 --> 00:39:37.250
LAURA: (gasping) No fucking way!

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:38.889
LIAM: Oh, I didn't know it did that.

00:39:38.889 --> 00:39:43.589
(laughter)

00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:45.240
LAURA: That's really cool.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.029
LIAM: Thank you!

00:39:47.029 --> 00:39:51.484
LAURA: Wow.

00:39:51.484 --> 00:39:57.767
LIAM: I don't know, this is the dumbest
conversation. This is bonus time. I shouldn't be

00:39:57.767 --> 00:40:10.049
here. It was the long sleep or come back and
help.

00:40:10.049 --> 00:40:18.904
LAURA: So she gave you the option and then you
came back and now you're what? Super? Super

00:40:18.904 --> 00:40:20.133
half-elf?

00:40:20.133 --> 00:40:28.299
LIAM: Well, I'm just following through on a
promise made.

00:40:28.299 --> 00:40:37.070
LAURA: And we defeat Vecna and you're done, you're
gone. That's it? Instant? Is it like we kill him

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:42.413
and you're gone that second or is it like we kill
him and you're here for another week or until

00:40:42.413 --> 00:40:44.739
the Raven Queen realizes that you're still here?

00:40:44.739 --> 00:40:47.142
LIAM: There isn't really a handbook.

00:40:47.142 --> 00:40:49.541
LAURA: She didn't tell you?

00:40:49.541 --> 00:41:09.521
LIAM: When Vecna is destroyed, she will call me
back to where I would be right now. I expect

00:41:09.521 --> 00:41:17.581
everyone-- Keyleth and I have barely spoken-- I
expect everyone to be sad, but I wish you wouldn't

00:41:17.581 --> 00:41:22.762
be so sad, not exorbitantly so, because I--

00:41:22.762 --> 00:41:27.429
LAURA: Exorbitant? That's a good word.

00:41:27.429 --> 00:41:42.132
LIAM: I read. Not as much as some, but I read.
This is the path that I have chosen for myself and

00:41:42.132 --> 00:41:51.717
I did it based out of desperation, at first. But
everyone dies.

00:41:51.717 --> 00:41:53.706
LAURA: I know.

00:41:53.706 --> 00:42:02.964
LIAM: And I think our group has become a little
spoiled. We're not your ordinary group of idiots. We

00:42:02.964 --> 00:42:05.337
have blessings.

00:42:05.337 --> 00:42:07.107
LAURA: We're blessed idiots.

00:42:07.107 --> 00:42:15.356
LIAM: Blessed idiots, yes, and I know that we've
gotten used to feeling like we can overcome losing

00:42:15.356 --> 00:42:30.076
anyone, but your average farmer or seamstress
doesn't come back. And everybody dies, and all

00:42:30.076 --> 00:42:36.229
that matters is what you do with what you have,
and I have done a lot, and I've taken great pride

00:42:36.229 --> 00:42:49.542
watching all that you have done. And I have good
friends and I have fallen in love. More than most,

00:42:49.542 --> 00:42:51.127
I've had.

00:42:51.127 --> 00:42:57.536
LAURA: Yeah. After you die, do you stand by her
side?

00:42:57.536 --> 00:43:06.738
LIAM: That I don't really know. I imagine she'll
keep me close.

00:43:06.738 --> 00:43:13.676
LAURA: Do you like her now?

00:43:13.676 --> 00:43:15.215
LIAM: Yes.

00:43:15.215 --> 00:43:17.606
LAURA: That's good.

00:43:17.606 --> 00:43:24.824
LIAM: She's necessary and she's of use, and I like
that.

00:43:24.824 --> 00:43:36.197
LAURA: She brought you back to us for a while. I
like her, too. Anyway, do you want the fucking

00:43:36.197 --> 00:43:46.454
boots back? Fuck! Yeah, sure, yes, fine, that's
fine. I wanted to give them back, so there you go.

00:43:46.454 --> 00:43:48.386
I'm glad you asked for them back.

00:43:48.386 --> 00:43:50.917
LIAM: I don't have a lot of time. They really are
my favorite thing.

00:43:50.917 --> 00:43:51.872
LAURA: I know.

00:43:51.872 --> 00:43:53.664
LIAM: Physical thing.

00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:58.171
LAURA: Just make sure you write it down
somewhere that after you go back to the Raven

00:43:58.171 --> 00:44:03.114
Queen that your sister is your favorite in the
universe.

00:44:03.114 --> 00:44:08.420
LIAM: Dear, every stitch on my body is yours when
I am gone.

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:17.103
LAURA: I don't want every stitch. None of it's
worth you leaving.

00:44:17.103 --> 00:44:25.240
LIAM: I slide my feet into the shoes and I wiggle my
toes around. Oh, I'm sorry. I also have a

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.748
confession to make.

00:44:26.748 --> 00:44:28.061
LAURA: What?

00:44:28.061 --> 00:44:34.507
LIAM: I don't exactly have your shoes anymore.

00:44:34.507 --> 00:44:35.726
LAURA: What?!

00:44:35.726 --> 00:44:38.528
LIAM: I think that I left them in the Feywild.

00:44:38.528 --> 00:44:40.818
LAURA: The Feywild?

00:44:40.818 --> 00:44:46.189
LIAM: Yeah, I think I dropped them into a bog. They
didn't fit me.

00:44:46.189 --> 00:44:50.023
LAURA: You are a motherfucker. You couldn't have
just put them in the Bag of Holding?

00:44:50.023 --> 00:44:51.688
LIAM: I'm still me.

00:44:51.688 --> 00:44:57.185
LAURA: Great, wonderful. I like being barefoot.

00:44:57.185 --> 00:45:02.890
LIAM: You have very cute, small feet that fit in
the boots that you gave me that did not fit my feet.

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.806
LAURA: That's great.

00:45:04.806 --> 00:45:06.974
LIAM: There's probably shoes here.

00:45:06.974 --> 00:45:14.820
LAURA: Probably. All right.

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:17.169
LIAM: I pull out her shoes and I put them down.

00:45:17.169 --> 00:45:19.178
LAURA: Well, at least there's that!

00:45:19.178 --> 00:45:23.937
MATT: Got your shoes back. Keyleth returns with
some coffee. The rest of you come to

00:45:23.937 --> 00:45:28.718
consciousness, and the morning sun is now blaring
down over the Cliffkeep. It's a strangely clear

00:45:28.718 --> 00:45:35.919
sky for the north. While a lot of it is relatively
cold usually, you're used to seeing the snow-

00:45:35.919 --> 00:45:40.548
capped mountaintops-- oh, you found it! There you
go.

00:45:40.548 --> 00:45:42.252
TALIESIN: It was with you the whole time.

00:45:42.252 --> 00:45:44.302
LIAM: Must have been inside your shoes.

00:45:44.302 --> 00:45:48.738
LAURA: Oh my gosh! I put it in the safe place and
I didn't realize it!

00:45:48.738 --> 00:45:50.470
TRAVIS: Thank you, chat.

00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:54.071
LAURA: Did they really know where I put it?

00:45:54.071 --> 00:45:56.536
TRAVIS: Yeah, they know where your shit is.

00:45:56.536 --> 00:46:01.061
SAM: The chat knew where you put your stuff?

00:46:01.061 --> 00:46:04.751
TRAVIS: "It's in the page in front of your blue
divider."

00:46:04.751 --> 00:46:07.707
SAM: No way!

00:46:07.707 --> 00:46:11.340
LAURA: Wow, thank you. Thank you, guys!

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.561
LIAM: How many fingers am I holding up?

00:46:14.561 --> 00:46:16.996
MATT: So bringing it back in, guys.

00:46:16.996 --> 00:46:18.450
SAM: Yes, we have a guest.

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:21.462
MATT: Yes. At some point. So what do you guys want
to do?

00:46:21.462 --> 00:46:24.816
SAM: Set off! For the Pools of Hatabah!

00:46:24.816 --> 00:46:28.333
(laughter)

00:46:28.333 --> 00:46:31.097
TALIESIN: For the forest near the Pools of--

00:46:31.097 --> 00:46:34.695
SAM: The adjacent to the Pools of Hatafah.

00:46:34.695 --> 00:46:40.077
TRAVIS: We didn't want to bring any extra muscle
with us, do we, from these peeps? Oh wait, we're

00:46:40.077 --> 00:46:42.607
misting a long ways away. Never mind. Sorry.
Forget it.

00:46:42.607 --> 00:46:44.988
LIAM: Grog, you are our extra muscle.

00:46:44.988 --> 00:46:48.774
TRAVIS: See! High five! Up top.

00:46:48.774 --> 00:46:50.207
LIAM: I'm not dead.

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:52.055
TRAVIS: His hand's cold.

00:46:52.055 --> 00:46:56.855
MATT: So you're traversing via your Wind Walk?

00:46:56.855 --> 00:47:00.226
MARISHA: I guess. Are we wind walking there?

00:47:00.226 --> 00:47:01.515
LAURA: (mispronouncing) Wind.

00:47:01.515 --> 00:47:04.856
MARISHA: (mispronouncing) Wind walk? Wind
walking.

00:47:04.856 --> 00:47:06.736
LIAM: (mispronouncing) Wil Wheaton!

00:47:06.736 --> 00:47:10.492
SAM: Hey, before we leave, real quick: Kiki.

00:47:10.492 --> 00:47:11.637
MARISHA: Yes.

00:47:11.637 --> 00:47:14.087
SAM: Can you send messages or anything?

00:47:14.087 --> 00:47:17.671
MARISHA: No, man. We have been through this with
our entire group so many times.

00:47:17.671 --> 00:47:19.561
SAM: It's just you're so powerful.

00:47:19.561 --> 00:47:20.831
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:47:20.831 --> 00:47:22.447
SAM: Let's go.

00:47:22.447 --> 00:47:23.907
MARISHA: What do you need?

00:47:23.907 --> 00:47:29.534
SAM: I would send a letter, but it'll take
weeks. So forget it. We'll be somewhere close to

00:47:29.534 --> 00:47:31.544
somewhere with magic soon.

00:47:31.544 --> 00:47:36.587
MARISHA: We can leave it in the hands of the
Ashari, see if they can find somebody.

00:47:36.646 --> 00:47:38.481
SAM: You trust these folks?

00:47:38.481 --> 00:47:40.421
MARISHA: Yeah. They're all right.

00:47:40.421 --> 00:47:42.788
TALIESIN and MARISHA: They're not the worst.

00:47:42.788 --> 00:47:48.464
SAM: All right, I'll scribble a little note and
say-- well, no, there's no way they can get it to--

00:47:48.464 --> 00:47:50.657
it's too far! It's too far!

00:47:50.657 --> 00:47:56.115
TALIESIN: I was really excited to see your face
when you handed it to them and they're like, what

00:47:56.115 --> 00:47:57.572
are we supposed to do with this?

00:47:57.572 --> 00:47:59.838
SAM: Here, I'll show you, Grog.

00:47:59.838 --> 00:48:01.910
TRAVIS: Write it out, bitch!

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:09.709
SAM: I write, a sphincter says what.

00:48:09.709 --> 00:48:19.372
TRAVIS: A. As. Good message. That's a big word at
the front.

00:48:19.372 --> 00:48:21.334
LAURA: You could have gotten the last one,
though.

00:48:21.334 --> 00:48:22.725
TRAVIS: What!

00:48:22.725 --> 00:48:25.166
SAM: Yes!

00:48:25.166 --> 00:48:28.691
MATT: Pike taps you on the shoulder and is like,
"I'll teach you that later."

00:48:28.691 --> 00:48:37.919
TALIESIN: Thank you for the Ashley Johnson
simulator. That was weirdly comforting.

00:48:37.919 --> 00:48:40.237
MATT: Curse you, Blindspot!

00:48:40.237 --> 00:48:41.786
TRAVIS: Yeah! Are we misting?

00:48:41.786 --> 00:48:43.239
SAM: Yeah, let's do it.

00:48:43.239 --> 00:48:47.745
LAURA: Should we eat a feast first, or should we
save that?

00:48:47.745 --> 00:48:49.224
TALIESIN: Let's save that.

00:48:49.224 --> 00:48:51.074
LAURA: Okay. I don't know what we're going to
find!

00:48:51.074 --> 00:48:56.108
MATT: That's up to you guys. So preparations being
done, you gather your materials, Keyleth completes

00:48:56.108 --> 00:49:01.494
the Wind Walk spell and you all feel yourselves
grow slightly lighter on your toes. You

00:49:01.494 --> 00:49:07.190
concentrate. Over the minute transformation, you
turn into your mist forms and take off in what

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:08.383
direction?

00:49:08.383 --> 00:49:12.125
MARISHA: Towards the Falafel Pools!

00:49:12.125 --> 00:49:14.555
SAM: We wrote it down.

00:49:14.555 --> 00:49:17.482
TALIESIN: Falafel pool is actually really tasty.

00:49:17.482 --> 00:49:19.887
TRAVIS: Pools of Wittebak.

00:49:19.887 --> 00:49:21.713
LAURA: Yeah! Towards the mountains!

00:49:21.713 --> 00:49:26.111
SAM: He said "which direction?" He did not say
"Where are you going?" He said "which direction?"

00:49:26.111 --> 00:49:28.647
LAURA: We got to look at our map.

00:49:28.647 --> 00:49:30.194
MARISHA: We have it on the map!

00:49:30.194 --> 00:49:31.555
LAURA: We have a map!

00:49:31.555 --> 00:49:36.674
MATT: Okay! Well, you have Terrah locked down. The
Pools of Wittebak would not be on your specific map

00:49:36.674 --> 00:49:40.931
that you acquired earlier. You can ask around
within Terrah within a brief time and figure it

00:49:40.931 --> 00:49:51.728
out. Somewhere between 100 and 120 miles, and he
points in a specific direction. You mark the sun's

00:49:51.728 --> 00:49:54.291
traveling and where certain landmarks are.

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:58.850
MARISHA: I quickly do the math of how fast I can
travel and be like okay, it shouldn't take long.

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:01.359
MATT: It's an eastward direction from where you
are.

00:50:01.359 --> 00:50:04.513
TALIESIN: You did actually, legitimately point
east, too, which makes that even better.

00:50:04.513 --> 00:50:05.758
MATT: That's weird.

00:50:05.758 --> 00:50:07.349
TALIESIN: Yeah, that is weird.

00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:14.012
MATT: I'm putting points in my nature skill. Or
survival, I guess. Anyway, too many editions in my

00:50:14.012 --> 00:50:23.967
head. (laughs) As you all take off into the
morning sky, you begin to rocket over, and you're

00:50:23.967 --> 00:50:28.417
hitting jets of wind that are beginning to find
their way over the mountain ranges, and you get

00:50:28.417 --> 00:50:31.953
blown a little off-course, but you maintain
concentration as best you can in that direction.

00:50:31.953 --> 00:50:34.136
Who is leading this venture?

00:50:34.136 --> 00:50:38.456
SAM: I've been there. No, I knew of it, right?

00:50:38.456 --> 00:50:40.178
MATT: You knew of it, yeah.

00:50:40.178 --> 00:50:42.128
SAM: But I don't know exactly where.

00:50:42.128 --> 00:50:48.145
LAURA: After listening to everybody, I'll lead the
way. That way, I can keep an eye out for the

00:50:48.145 --> 00:50:53.315
forest next, too, and the house and all the
things we're looking for. I got a good look at the

00:50:53.377 --> 00:50:56.294
map that Pelor held up in front of us, as well.

00:50:56.294 --> 00:51:05.120
MATT: Right. Okay, cool. I need you to go ahead
and make a survival check. Actually, for this, I'm

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:08.426
gonna say-- yeah, because it would be tracking in
the wilderness. So survival.

00:51:08.426 --> 00:51:14.162
LAURA: Survival? Great. Any advantage on that?

00:51:14.162 --> 00:51:16.424
SAM: Wilderness is your favored terrain.

00:51:16.424 --> 00:51:18.528
MATT: It's mountains, technically.

00:51:18.528 --> 00:51:20.033
LAURA: That's also my favored.

00:51:20.033 --> 00:51:21.489
MATT: Then yeah, roll again.

00:51:21.489 --> 00:51:23.219
TRAVIS: Because that was a one.

00:51:23.219 --> 00:51:26.331
LAURA: Oh! So much better. 28.

00:51:26.331 --> 00:51:33.083
MATT: Okay, that'll do it. Your speed is
tremendous when in this form, so what would have

00:51:33.083 --> 00:51:39.621
been an extended trek on foot over a series of
days, it takes you mere hours to eventually get to

00:51:39.621 --> 00:51:47.662
a point where you crest one heavy peak. On the
opposite side, you can see down the cliffside, the

00:51:47.662 --> 00:51:54.379
edge reaches a slight precipice, and there you can
see what looks to be for a mile or so a cluster of

00:51:54.379 --> 00:52:02.458
dozens and dozens of pools of water of different
sizes, all jammed together in a geothermic

00:52:02.458 --> 00:52:07.676
cluster, where you can see bright greens that move
to a deep orange-maroon at the edges from the

00:52:07.676 --> 00:52:12.196
various mineral deposits that have collected over
hundreds and hundreds of years. You can see large

00:52:12.196 --> 00:52:18.815
columns of smoke and steam of different chemical
colors rising out of various large pools, and at a

00:52:18.815 --> 00:52:25.700
glance down, you can see a number of shapes: a
number of hulking, humanoid shapes; somewhere in

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:31.571
the neighborhood of 40 to 50 or so scattered at
different pools, moving in small clusters or

00:52:31.571 --> 00:52:37.566
gangs. Some of them are jumping in, cannonballing
and swimming through the actual pools. Some of

00:52:37.566 --> 00:52:42.264
them are lounging around and lying. Some of them
appear to be returning, dragging things from the

00:52:42.264 --> 00:52:46.498
nearby forest on the eastern side of the bank.

00:52:46.498 --> 00:52:51.911
MARISHA: This is a vacation spot. What's that
water park nearby?

00:52:51.911 --> 00:52:53.506
LAURA: Wet 'N' Wild?

00:52:53.506 --> 00:52:58.513
MATT: Essentially, for a few hundred years, you
get the sense that the Pools of Wittebak have been

00:52:58.513 --> 00:53:06.111
a hill giant water park. You can see these large
mounds of mud and scrap wood and things that have

00:53:06.111 --> 00:53:09.937
been built into these large hill giant domiciles
onto the side of the mountain not far from the

00:53:09.937 --> 00:53:20.055
pools. It's become a definite hill giant wandering
zone. So do you guys continue over the pools, down

00:53:20.055 --> 00:53:22.097
towards the nearby forest ridge?

00:53:22.097 --> 00:53:23.821
LAURA: Yeah, past the pools.

00:53:23.821 --> 00:53:28.747
MATT: All righty. You come to the forest ridge,
and you can see it's not thick forest. The ravine

00:53:28.747 --> 00:53:38.014
comes down off the precipice where the pools are.
You get a few hundred-- I'd say, actually more

00:53:38.014 --> 00:53:44.200
than that. A thousand or more feet away from that
precipice before plants even begin to grow. It

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:50.351
looks like whatever toxic chemicals have burbled
up in some of these pools have made a lot of the

00:53:50.351 --> 00:53:56.998
ground there unable to give any forest life or
sustain any large trees. As soon as the forest

00:53:56.998 --> 00:54:05.913
begins, it's a dense little pocket, maybe a mile
and a half, two miles across. That's what you've

00:54:05.969 --> 00:54:07.971
got. What do you guys want to do?

00:54:07.971 --> 00:54:16.696
LAURA: Oh man. I should try to track any
footprints in there and see if there's something

00:54:16.696 --> 00:54:23.403
around the edges, maybe, that lead back to-- shit,
I don't fucking know. It's only a couple of

00:54:23.403 --> 00:54:24.638
miles.

00:54:24.638 --> 00:54:33.696
MATT: If you guys begin to do a loop-over, who's
doing a quick pass over the patch of forest? All

00:54:33.696 --> 00:54:36.098
right, make a perception check.

00:54:36.098 --> 00:54:49.467
LAURA: It's the forest. Do I get advantage on that
one? Perception? What is that, 21? 21.

00:54:49.467 --> 00:54:50.905
TALIESIN: 12.

00:54:50.905 --> 00:54:55.658
MATT: Okay. Glancing over, you don't see any major
glades or clearings. There doesn't appear to be

00:54:55.658 --> 00:55:03.092
any sign of bastions of civilization or any sort
of logging going on. There's no areas where trees

00:55:03.092 --> 00:55:08.874
have been cut or cleared. It's a featureless
forest top, from what you can see.

00:55:08.874 --> 00:55:13.256
LAURA: Can we fly down lower to where we're in
between the trees?

00:55:13.256 --> 00:55:16.905
MATT: You can go down into the forest, if you'd
like. All right, who's going into the forest,

00:55:16.905 --> 00:55:17.917
then?

00:55:17.917 --> 00:55:18.846
MARISHA: I'll go.

00:55:18.846 --> 00:55:20.409
LAURA: I'll go. All of us?

00:55:20.409 --> 00:55:26.977
MATT: So with Pike following suit, you guys all
swoop down through the boughs of the trees and

00:55:26.977 --> 00:55:32.301
into the center of the forest itself. Within
there, it's not a super thick canopy; it's not as

00:55:32.301 --> 00:55:37.317
heavy as the Feywild or some of the recent forests
that cluster around Vasselheim. There are breaks

00:55:37.317 --> 00:55:41.437
in the canopy where you can see the sunbeams come
through from the morning sun that's rising up

00:55:41.437 --> 00:55:46.998
higher and higher in the sky as you've traveled. The
mist has burned away in this area, so it's a nice,

00:55:46.998 --> 00:55:54.855
warm forest. Glancing about, there is a lot of
life in here. You can see signs of squirrels. You

00:55:54.855 --> 00:55:59.083
rush by what was a family of wolverine-like
creatures that are rustling by. As soon as the

00:55:59.083 --> 00:56:04.083
wind scoots in and your mist forms come rocketing
past, they all scatter and run off into the

00:56:04.083 --> 00:56:13.505
shadows. There's a lot of forest ground here to
cover. For you to really super track with

00:56:13.505 --> 00:56:17.404
advantage, you'd have to go into human form. I'd
give you a regular roll if you want to try and

00:56:17.404 --> 00:56:19.642
track in your mist form.

00:56:19.642 --> 00:56:26.543
LAURA: Not so much tracking right now, just a
loose passover as we're going, looking for any

00:56:26.543 --> 00:56:34.607
kind of hunting traps or trails, signs of life of
things that have been traversed a lot.

00:56:34.607 --> 00:56:38.751
MATT: I'd say make an investigation check.

00:56:38.751 --> 00:56:42.073
LAURA: 27.

00:56:42.073 --> 00:56:51.503
MATT: 27. Begin coasting through tree after tree
through small, tiny bits of clearing that

00:56:51.503 --> 00:56:58.411
immediately come into large clusters of trunks and
knotted branches that all merge and cluster at

00:56:58.411 --> 00:57:04.310
different intersections. After about 20 or so
minutes of this, trying to do a large spiral

00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:12.518
around the forest inward, out of the corner of
your eye, Vex'ahlia, you glance over and see a

00:57:12.518 --> 00:57:18.853
quick glimpse of something that appears to be more
structured. You look back and rush over and there

00:57:18.853 --> 00:57:28.532
you see amongst the trees what appears to be a
humble-looking two-story home. You see a small

00:57:28.532 --> 00:57:36.789
balcony built on the second floor that goes over
one of the larger rooms in the bottom floor. It's

00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:42.871
not huge, by any means, and is hidden by a lot of
the local brush and trees there. Can't get a lot

00:57:42.871 --> 00:57:45.305
more detail at this distance, though.

00:57:45.305 --> 00:57:48.839
LAURA: Okay. We land. I land.

00:57:48.839 --> 00:57:50.162
MARISHA: I follow.

00:57:50.162 --> 00:57:53.115
LAURA: And behind a tree, I'm going to take form.

00:57:53.115 --> 00:57:55.256
MATT: You take your form? Okay. So all of you land
and follow Vex?

00:57:55.256 --> 00:57:56.455
SAM: Yeah!

00:57:56.455 --> 00:58:02.870
MATT: You all take a minute to go back to your
physical forms. You glance over, and there it is,

00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:08.962
standing before you. It's very shaded in this part
of the forest. You can see a little bit of what

00:58:08.962 --> 00:58:11.952
looks to be interior light, very faint.

00:58:11.952 --> 00:58:16.041
TRAVIS: Like a normal person-sized dwelling?

00:58:16.041 --> 00:58:21.342
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:58:21.342 --> 00:58:23.310
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

00:58:23.310 --> 00:58:24.732
LAURA: Yay!

00:58:24.732 --> 00:58:32.865
MATT: It would be a little small for you, Grog.
But you could walk in it. Proportionally, it looks

00:58:32.865 --> 00:58:37.437
maybe like it was built for a little bit of a
smaller person.

00:58:37.437 --> 00:58:38.891
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:58:38.891 --> 00:58:46.301
LIAM: I want to start eyeballing the ground of the
house for any kinds of traps set out. Is that

00:58:46.301 --> 00:58:47.629
investigation, yeah?

00:58:47.629 --> 00:58:48.861
MATT: That is investigation.

00:58:48.861 --> 00:58:49.884
LIAM: 18.

00:58:49.884 --> 00:58:53.831
MATT: 18. Okay. So you guys begin to slowly--

00:58:53.831 --> 00:59:02.671
TRAVIS: Wait. Before we do, there are no random
nudist giants that have run over in this area,

00:59:02.671 --> 00:59:05.690
right? There's nobody sees us over here taking
off?

00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:07.767
TALIESIN: You're worried about giants streaking?

00:59:07.767 --> 00:59:09.681
TRAVIS: Not particularly.

00:59:09.681 --> 00:59:11.879
TALIESIN: That was &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; specific.

00:59:11.879 --> 00:59:15.600
TRAVIS: Well, yeah, have you ever seen a giant
naked? You'll never forget it.

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:18.862
TALIESIN: I might. I don't know.

00:59:18.862 --> 00:59:21.037
SAM: Are you suggesting we set up a perimeter?

00:59:21.037 --> 00:59:25.489
TRAVIS: Yeah! I mean, it's a tiny house, I don't
really want to go in there. I like having exits I

00:59:25.489 --> 00:59:26.505
fit through.

00:59:26.505 --> 00:59:33.007
LAURA: I don't want whoever it is to think that we
threaten them in any way. But then, if they

00:59:33.007 --> 00:59:35.701
threaten us, I wouldn't want them to attack us,
either.

00:59:35.701 --> 00:59:37.674
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll just knock the house down from
the outside.

00:59:37.674 --> 00:59:41.962
TALIESIN: Let's keep this structure standing for
now.

00:59:41.962 --> 00:59:43.462
TRAVIS: I'll stay outside.

00:59:43.462 --> 00:59:49.430
SAM: Are we knocking properly or are we just going
to Invisibility in and see who's in there?

00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:51.493
LAURA: I feel like maybe knock properly.

00:59:51.493 --> 00:59:56.697
TALIESIN: If you think long and hard about it,
it's not like manners have failed us very often.

00:59:56.697 --> 01:00:00.894
LAURA: Yeah. But do keep an eye out for traps or
anything weird on the way up.

01:00:00.894 --> 01:00:03.143
MARISHA: I think we've failed at manners often.

01:00:03.143 --> 01:00:08.839
TALIESIN: We fail at manners more often. We'll see
how this goes. We'll try being nice.

01:00:08.839 --> 01:00:10.315
TRAVIS: I'll stay out here.

01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:13.519
SAM: I'll go knock on the door. It seems like a
smallish door, right?

01:00:13.519 --> 01:00:14.935
LAURA: Yeah, I'll go with you.

01:00:14.935 --> 01:00:16.339
MATT: Okay, so what's the marching order?

01:00:16.339 --> 01:00:18.339
SAM: I'll go first.

01:00:18.339 --> 01:00:20.892
LIAM: Nothing perked up my spidey-sense?

01:00:20.892 --> 01:00:25.334
MATT: From this current glance, no. You guys are
behind a tree at a distance.

01:00:25.334 --> 01:00:27.882
TRAVIS: No nude giants, right?

01:00:27.882 --> 01:00:30.545
MATT: Currently, no, but you're keeping an eye
out.

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:33.627
LAURA: I'm walking with a smile, looking very
friendly.

01:00:33.627 --> 01:00:35.361
MATT: Who's leading the charge?

01:00:35.361 --> 01:00:37.252
SAM: I'll go knock.

01:00:37.308 --> 01:00:38.929
LAURA: I'll walk behind Scanlan.

01:00:38.929 --> 01:00:42.163
MATT: We have Scanlan and Vex'ahlia.

01:00:42.163 --> 01:00:45.256
LIAM: I'm going to go, as well, and continue to
eyeball for traps.

01:00:45.256 --> 01:00:47.741
TALIESIN: I'll be hanging back a bit, as well.

01:00:47.741 --> 01:00:49.758
MARISHA: I'll be comfortably back, as well.

01:00:49.758 --> 01:00:52.484
SAM: Before we knock, what were we told was in
this thing?

01:00:52.484 --> 01:00:54.350
TRAVIS: The key.

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:57.794
SAM: The key. Inside a person, inside a house.

01:00:57.794 --> 01:01:00.123
LAURA: It's possible the person is the key; we're
not sure.

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:01.888
MATT: Is Trinket within your necklace for this?

01:01:01.888 --> 01:01:03.138
LAURA: No, he's out.

01:01:03.138 --> 01:01:07.125
MATT: Okay, Trinket is out alongside you. Grog?

01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:09.542
LAURA: He's a very friendly bear, look at him!

01:01:09.542 --> 01:01:10.878
TRAVIS: I'm outside the house.

01:01:10.878 --> 01:01:12.538
LAURA: Trinket, smile! Be friendly!

01:01:12.538 --> 01:01:16.870
MATT: As you get across this small walkway towards
the front, as you're walking with a big smile,

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:21.284
Vex'ahlia, something catches your eye on the
ground right before her and you watch as she steps

01:01:21.284 --> 01:01:24.864
forward. You reach out and grab her wrist and hold
her back before she steps down.

01:01:24.864 --> 01:01:26.607
LAURA: What is it?

01:01:26.607 --> 01:01:32.800
MATT: There is a large, rusted, iron bear trap
that is open that you almost stepped right into.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.697
TRAVIS: That would be have been donesies.

01:01:34.697 --> 01:01:42.687
LAURA: I was being friendly, and it almost crushed
me. Trinket, be careful, this thing was made for

01:01:42.687 --> 01:01:43.638
you.

01:01:43.638 --> 01:01:46.050
MATT: Trinket walks up to it.

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:48.041
LAURA: No, no, be careful! Spit on it!

01:01:48.041 --> 01:01:49.415
MATT: (growling)

01:01:49.415 --> 01:01:51.226
LAURA: Can he spit? Can Trinket spit?

01:01:51.226 --> 01:01:59.572
MATT: (bear spitting) It's not very-- it's more of
a power drool, if you will.

01:01:59.572 --> 01:02:04.090
LIAM: Is it easy enough to walk around?

01:02:04.090 --> 01:02:08.361
MATT: You can walk around that one, and you begin
to see what looks to be seven other ones that are

01:02:08.361 --> 01:02:09.984
clustered around.

01:02:09.984 --> 01:02:12.459
TALIESIN: This is probably a giant-infested
forest.

01:02:12.459 --> 01:02:20.598
MARISHA: Yes, that's exactly why. Bear traps are the
biggest thing you can get for a giant.

01:02:20.598 --> 01:02:21.738
SAM: Can we evade them and get into--

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:34.183
MATT: You begin to walk around. Yeah, you would,
actually. As you step around one, you can see, at

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:39.984
the front door, there is a welcome mat that says
"welcome." As you're approaching it, you can see

01:02:39.984 --> 01:02:45.556
the welcome mat, there's just something a little
off about it. Like, it's raised higher than the

01:02:45.556 --> 01:02:46.862
ground should be.

01:02:46.862 --> 01:02:48.400
TRAVIS: Willkommen.

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.163
MARISHA: Trapped?

01:02:50.163 --> 01:02:55.037
LIAM: Well, I could attempt to dicker with it, but
we could just knock the door over it if we really

01:02:55.037 --> 01:02:56.779
are going on manners.

01:02:56.779 --> 01:02:59.735
TALIESIN: Double-check to make sure the door isn't
a problem, either. I'd imagine if the welcome mat

01:02:59.735 --> 01:03:00.526
is.

01:03:00.526 --> 01:03:04.188
LIAM: The door's going to blow up if we knock on
it? I mean, we don't have much luck with doors.

01:03:04.188 --> 01:03:07.811
LAURA: Can I grab a stick and lift the edge of the
mat up?

01:03:07.811 --> 01:03:10.848
LIAM: Do you want to do that?

01:03:10.848 --> 01:03:13.700
MATT: Are you stopping her from doing that?

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:22.512
LIAM: Yes, I am! Let me take a look at it, please!
I've already detected it. I will attempt to disarm

01:03:22.512 --> 01:03:24.282
it with thieves' tools, correct?

01:03:24.282 --> 01:03:25.632
MATT: Yes.

01:03:25.632 --> 01:03:29.132
LIAM: That's fine. That is a 29.

01:03:29.132 --> 01:03:36.307
MATT: You walk over. You look and you watch.
There's a small cord that is hidden amongst the

01:03:36.307 --> 01:03:42.105
brush that runs from underneath the mat through a
small ring that goes up from the house, then up a

01:03:42.105 --> 01:03:47.129
branch or vine, so it's hidden amongst them. You
look straight up about 40 feet, you see a nice,

01:03:47.129 --> 01:03:51.450
solid, thick trunk that is just (creaking).

01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:54.185
TRAVIS: That's some Predator shit!

01:03:54.185 --> 01:03:56.057
MATT: Right above the door.

01:03:56.057 --> 01:04:02.261
TALIESIN: I feel like there's a complicated story
that goes along with all of this. I'm really

01:04:02.261 --> 01:04:03.477
excited by it.

01:04:03.477 --> 01:04:06.364
MARISHA: Is this going to be an Uncharted kind of
adventure?

01:04:06.364 --> 01:04:09.931
TALIESIN: We have found the cabin of Macaulay
Culkin!

01:04:09.931 --> 01:04:20.109
MATT: So knowing this, you walk over and grab the
cord. Looking to see where the leverage is, you

01:04:20.109 --> 01:04:28.589
motion to Grog to come over and hold it. You find
another piece of heavy stone that is by the wall

01:04:28.589 --> 01:04:34.755
to the side. With Grog's help, you snip it, bring
it over, and tie it onto the edge of this piece of

01:04:34.755 --> 01:04:40.826
the stonework, like a small pole that was placed
at the base of the house. It holds the weight of

01:04:40.826 --> 01:04:44.150
this suspended trunk and it no longer triggers
based on the step.

01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:47.629
LIAM: Percy, I'm sorry, I know you like a good
Rube Goldberg.

01:04:47.629 --> 01:04:50.826
TALIESIN: I was really excited by this thing. It's
a shame to dismantle it.

01:04:50.826 --> 01:04:56.350
LAURA: It's still there. Maybe when we leave, we
can crash it down.

01:04:56.350 --> 01:04:59.366
LIAM: Does the door look hinky at all?

01:04:59.366 --> 01:05:01.315
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:05:01.315 --> 01:05:04.393
MARISHA: You did say kinky, right?

01:05:04.393 --> 01:05:06.084
LIAM: I said hinky. 18.

01:05:06.084 --> 01:05:12.455
MATT: 18. It does not appear to be trapped, per
se. It does appear to be locked.

01:05:12.455 --> 01:05:14.698
LIAM: Yeah, well, I don't want to pick it.

01:05:14.698 --> 01:05:17.515
LAURA: I want to use a stick, and oh! Here,
Scanlan, you were going to knock.

01:05:17.515 --> 01:05:19.543
SAM: (chuckles) What is this stick?

01:05:19.543 --> 01:05:21.961
LAURA: So that you don't have to touch the door in
case it's magic.

01:05:21.961 --> 01:05:28.786
MATT: Which as a note, the door, at full height, is
about at the shoulders of most of you. You

01:05:28.786 --> 01:05:35.502
recognize this. This is definitely a homestead
built on the scale for probably halfling or gnome.

01:05:35.502 --> 01:05:40.889
It's still pretty big for a gnomish home, meaning
it's a little more spacious headroom, you'd

01:05:40.889 --> 01:05:45.655
probably be able to stand in comfortably, except
for you, Grog, you're probably a little hunched.

01:05:45.655 --> 01:05:49.757
LIAM: So it's like an ostentatious gnome door.
Little more than is needed.

01:05:49.757 --> 01:05:56.014
SAM: Like me. I'll just rap on the door with my
knuckles.

01:05:56.014 --> 01:06:01.368
MATT: Okay. There is an awkward pause.

01:06:01.368 --> 01:06:08.310
SAM: Hello? Bidet?

01:06:08.310 --> 01:06:10.600
MATT: Darin, if you want to go ahead onto the
stage, please.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:16.846
(cheering)

01:06:16.846 --> 01:06:20.580
LAURA: I'm glad he didn't murder us with his bear
traps.

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:24.635
SAM: You need this? Oh, you need this. &lt;i&gt;Oh!&lt;/i&gt; I've
been goosed.

01:06:24.635 --> 01:06:29.509
LIAM: Hey, chaotic evil necromancer gnome.

01:06:29.509 --> 01:06:32.504
MATT: You weren't supposed to tell them.

01:06:32.504 --> 01:06:34.143
DARIN: I didn't.

01:06:34.143 --> 01:06:42.839
MATT: So you hear amongst your business for the
day, out of nowhere (knocking) on the door.

01:06:42.839 --> 01:06:44.779
SAM: Kaitiaki!

01:06:44.779 --> 01:06:48.215
DARIN: I open it.

01:06:48.215 --> 01:06:54.432
MATT: Okay, you hear (clicking) what sounds like
six or seven different locks unlock on the door,

01:06:54.432 --> 01:06:57.815
as it slowly swings open, and before them what do
they see?

01:06:57.865 --> 01:07:09.691
DARIN: A very small, elderly gnome, bald on top,
with a long white beard, and a bit of a distant

01:07:09.691 --> 01:07:17.058
look in his eyes, and he looks at you and says,
are you real?

01:07:17.058 --> 01:07:20.728
LAURA: I think so.

01:07:20.728 --> 01:07:30.480
DARIN: You're real? Prove it! Say that you're real
to my invisible frog companion.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:37.629
SAM: I will step forward and say, hello, there.
(whispers) I'm real.

01:07:37.629 --> 01:07:43.557
DARIN: Yes, you're real. There is no invisible
frog companion. The voices in my head would not

01:07:43.557 --> 01:07:49.475
have spoken to that. (stuttering) They know a
little bit better than that, but that doesn't

01:07:49.475 --> 01:07:59.860
matter, I haven't had people here in over 35
years. (laughs) But you're here! And you're real!

01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:01.248
Go away.

01:08:01.248 --> 01:08:03.486
(laughter)

01:08:03.486 --> 01:08:05.727
DARIN: Demistrik, show them out.

01:08:05.727 --> 01:08:14.490
MATT: You watch as two tiny red claws come around
the corner as these tiny, impish wings unfurl. You

01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:20.300
watch as a tiny imp releases from the edge of the
doorframe. (wings beating) "Get out!"

01:08:20.361 --> 01:08:22.446
(door slamming) and slams the door.

01:08:22.446 --> 01:08:28.753
DARIN: And show yourself out, Demistrik. I don't
need you here, 19 years of you is more than

01:08:28.753 --> 01:08:30.236
enough.

01:08:30.236 --> 01:08:34.323
MATT: You hear muffling argument through the door
as the voice goes, "I'll stay where I damn please.

01:08:34.323 --> 01:08:37.723
"You gave me permission to stay. If anyone is going
to leave, &lt;i&gt;you're&lt;/i&gt; going to leave!"

01:08:37.723 --> 01:08:42.537
DARIN: I think you should go to Kraghammer and
become a circus performer with a little tin cup

01:08:42.537 --> 01:08:47.770
and a little hat and say, "Oh dear, I am
Demistrik, the magical imp." That's where you

01:08:47.770 --> 01:08:49.115
belong, I tell you right now.

01:08:49.115 --> 01:08:52.877
MATT: "Sounds like a lot more fun than having to
deal with you on a daily basis, you son of a--"

01:08:52.877 --> 01:08:57.434
DARIN: (offended cry) Language, imp!

01:08:57.434 --> 01:09:02.156
MATT: The door creaks open once more. "Sorry."
(door closing)

01:09:02.156 --> 01:09:08.205
DARIN: The door creaks open again. I'm sorry, as
well. (whispering) For him, he's &lt;i&gt;awful&lt;/i&gt;.

01:09:08.205 --> 01:09:09.771
LIAM: I stick my foot in!

01:09:09.771 --> 01:09:10.768
DARIN: No!

01:09:10.768 --> 01:09:13.498
(laughter)

01:09:13.498 --> 01:09:18.476
LIAM: I'm really very sorry to bother you, although
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance. I'm

01:09:18.476 --> 01:09:24.674
having a very hard time not just smiling like an
idiot. Could we trouble you just for a few

01:09:24.674 --> 01:09:33.674
moments? We mean no harm at all. We do need to
talk to you. We've come a very long way... as

01:09:33.674 --> 01:09:37.708
farts. That's got to count for something.

01:09:37.708 --> 01:09:41.633
LAURA: (sing-songy) We could give you some
interesting conversation. 35 years is a very long

01:09:41.633 --> 01:09:42.539
time.

01:09:42.539 --> 01:09:45.404
LIAM: We've done a lot, we've seen a lot, we could
tell you all about it.

01:09:45.404 --> 01:09:53.591
SAM: I play an old, traditional gnome song to
soften him a bit.

01:09:53.591 --> 01:09:55.900
MATT: Make a performance check.

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:57.624
LAURA: What is an old gnome song?

01:09:57.624 --> 01:09:58.841
SAM: I don't know.

01:09:58.841 --> 01:10:00.910
(laughter)

01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:02.750
SAM: 24.

01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:07.661
MATT: It's been a long time since you've heard
music, let alone one that scratches an old memory

01:10:07.661 --> 01:10:11.073
of childhood. It's nice.

01:10:11.073 --> 01:10:13.673
TALIESIN: It's more or less whatever strikes your
fancy, to be fair.

01:10:13.673 --> 01:10:21.305
ALL: (humming Going to the Chapel)

01:10:21.305 --> 01:10:24.293
MATT: You see the imp in the back going, "Ugh!
Stop that racket!"

01:10:24.293 --> 01:10:29.635
DARIN: You don't even appreciate music. What would
an imp song sound like? You can't say one, can

01:10:29.635 --> 01:10:31.888
you? Because you don't have music where you're
from.

01:10:31.888 --> 01:10:35.810
MATT: "I can, but it'll cause your ears to
bleed! It sounds like this." (screeching)

01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:40.133
DARIN: I find that very entertaining.

01:10:40.133 --> 01:10:45.729
MATT: "You're such a liar!" The imp (poof)
vanishes before you.

01:10:45.729 --> 01:10:54.019
DARIN: He's gone. Don't worry about him. He gets a
little bit... testy, if you will.

01:10:54.019 --> 01:11:00.622
SAM: May we speak? May we have a moment of your
time?

01:11:00.622 --> 01:11:06.779
DARIN: Oh, well... Very well. You can come in if
you like. Oh! Be careful, there's illusions and

01:11:06.779 --> 01:11:10.430
thingamabobbers.

01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:17.314
LIAM: (stammers) Sorry, that's infectious. We have
a really big guy. Are you all right with him

01:11:17.314 --> 01:11:19.442
coming in? Grog, are you all right with coming
in?

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:21.917
TRAVIS: How the fuck do I get in that damn door?

01:11:21.917 --> 01:11:24.012
LIAM: Have you not crawled on all fours before?

01:11:24.012 --> 01:11:26.004
TALIESIN: You should try it if you haven't; it's
quite delightful.

01:11:26.004 --> 01:11:27.421
TRAVIS: Are you lying?

01:11:27.421 --> 01:11:29.769
TALIESIN: No. For once, no, I'm not.

01:11:29.769 --> 01:11:31.187
TRAVIS: Can I do an insight check on Percy?

01:11:31.187 --> 01:11:32.623
MATT: Sure.

01:11:32.623 --> 01:11:36.822
TRAVIS: 19.

01:11:36.822 --> 01:11:44.207
TALIESIN: I have never actually been quite so
honest in my entire life. I think you'll find it

01:11:44.207 --> 01:11:45.476
very therapeutic.

01:11:45.476 --> 01:11:47.518
TRAVIS: I roll in on all fours.

01:11:47.518 --> 01:11:49.233
TALIESIN: How does it feel?

01:11:49.233 --> 01:11:51.290
TRAVIS: I'm waiting for it to kick in.

01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:57.200
TALIESIN: Crawl forward, back a bit, stretch,
downward dog, stretch.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:05.700
MATT: You watch as this large, gray-skinned
mountain of a man crawls his way in. You could

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:20.067
duck-walk through if you really wanted to. This is
worse than Gandalf in Bag End. All fours is

01:12:20.067 --> 01:12:24.732
probably the most comfortable means of transport
through the house. But you walk in and

01:12:24.732 --> 01:12:30.514
immediately, you watch as your new gnomish friend
is going around and quickly disabling small

01:12:30.514 --> 01:12:37.530
things, putting small keys and tying off strings
and wires you saw that were set up around portions

01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:38.597
of the room.

01:12:38.597 --> 01:12:41.715
TALIESIN: I am going to try and map this in my
head, the crazy stuff I'm seeing right now.

01:12:41.715 --> 01:12:53.011
MATT: This place is a hoarder's den. You see
shelves and shelves of books and papers and

01:12:53.011 --> 01:12:59.479
scrolls and stacks of them. You see on bits of
furniture and chairs more stacks of books and

01:12:59.479 --> 01:13:06.752
sacks and satchels and quills and inkwells. Some
spilled and left and dried long ago. This place is

01:13:06.752 --> 01:13:10.563
very lived-in, very chaotic, and very unique.

01:13:10.563 --> 01:13:15.510
LIAM: The first thing that I do as we come in is I
scan the room, or rooms, for more Macaulay Culkin

01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:16.698
shenanigans.

01:13:16.698 --> 01:13:18.393
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:13:18.393 --> 01:13:20.671
TALIESIN: Maculkins. I think we can just call them
Maculkins now.

01:13:20.671 --> 01:13:29.242
LIAM: That is a 21.

01:13:29.242 --> 01:13:36.989
MATT: Okay. You do see there's one portion of the
floor that he keeps avoiding, instinctually, that

01:13:36.989 --> 01:13:39.802
catches your attention. You're like, "why does he
keep walking around that?"

01:13:39.802 --> 01:13:43.303
MARISHA: What's your name, friend?

01:13:43.303 --> 01:13:50.879
DARIN: Oh, well, that was taken from me a very
long time ago. I only have what they call me. You

01:13:50.879 --> 01:13:57.183
know, names are an odd thing, aren't they?
Sometimes a name can stick to you like blood on a

01:13:57.183 --> 01:14:03.468
knife or your fingers on a wallet that might not
be your property, and then who you were is not who

01:14:03.468 --> 01:14:07.104
you are and yet... here we are.

01:14:07.104 --> 01:14:11.475
MARISHA: That oddly made way too much sense.

01:14:11.670 --> 01:14:13.995
SAM: What do they call you?

01:14:13.995 --> 01:14:25.537
DARIN: They call me Sprigg. There's more. They
call me Sprigg the Obnoxious.

01:14:25.537 --> 01:14:27.891
SAM: Sprigg the Obnoxious?

01:14:27.891 --> 01:14:32.776
DARIN: Yes. It's not my given name; it was a name
that was given to me when it was given to me.

01:14:32.776 --> 01:14:36.126
LIAM: Did you used to be obnoxious? Because I'm
not picking that up.

01:14:36.126 --> 01:14:41.152
DARIN: Oh. We're rarely who we used to be.

01:14:41.152 --> 01:14:44.314
TALIESIN: Is there mercury in those pools?

01:14:44.314 --> 01:14:49.373
(laughter)

01:14:49.373 --> 01:14:52.428
DARIN: Who? Is that a friend of yours?

01:14:52.428 --> 01:14:55.765
TALIESIN: I sometimes will talk to the fourth
wall. It's a thing; ignore it.

01:14:55.765 --> 01:15:01.928
DARIN: It's a domicile. There has to be four
walls. If there weren't, it would be a yurt. I

01:15:01.928 --> 01:15:04.060
don't live in a yurt, dear boy.

01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:09.425
MARISHA: I sometimes live in a yurt. They're quite
nice.

01:15:09.425 --> 01:15:16.242
DARIN: I have nothing against yurts. (laughs) Like
a stick that you would put in a yurt so it

01:15:16.242 --> 01:15:21.554
wouldn't fall over. I would want it to fall over,
therefore, I have nothing against yurts.

01:15:21.616 --> 01:15:25.144
(wheezing laughter) Demistrik!

01:15:25.144 --> 01:15:32.702
MATT: The imp just appears across
the room and just goes, "Good one. That was-- I am

01:15:32.702 --> 01:15:34.190
"so sorry."

01:15:34.190 --> 01:15:41.851
LAURA: Pike? Do you think maybe a Greater
Restoration is in order?

01:15:41.851 --> 01:15:46.777
MATT: Pike goes, "Why?"

01:15:46.777 --> 01:15:49.465
LAURA: No reason.

01:15:49.465 --> 01:15:56.720
MATT: "Could I just touch your hand for a second?
Is that okay?"

01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:00.306
DARIN: (stuttering) Why?

01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:03.858
MATT: "Just to see if we can help your day."

01:16:03.858 --> 01:16:06.560
DARIN: Do you not think that I'm real?

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.801
MATT: "Probably not."

01:16:08.801 --> 01:16:15.121
DARIN: I assure you, I'm real. I'm here. My
companions are long gone. They were like you, like

01:16:15.121 --> 01:16:24.609
you, like you, and you, and you, and I'm all that
is left. You are looking into a mirror of your

01:16:24.609 --> 01:16:25.753
future.

01:16:25.753 --> 01:16:30.220
SAM: I'm going to look like you, or you're going
to look like me?

01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:34.577
MARISHA: No, I know what he means. Who were your
companions?

01:16:34.577 --> 01:16:42.132
DARIN: Memories. They're all memories now. I don't
even remember their names. I remember some of

01:16:42.132 --> 01:16:48.360
them, but we were heroes and now I am here.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.783
MARISHA: Oh no.

01:16:50.783 --> 01:16:54.439
LIAM: Were there no other gnome folk in your
party?

01:16:54.439 --> 01:17:03.452
DARIN: No, there was one like you, there was a big
one, a mighty one. There was one like you, brave

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:05.579
and kind.

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:07.964
LAURA: That's like me! That's exactly like me.

01:17:07.964 --> 01:17:22.647
DARIN: There was one like you. Smart, yet sad. And
you, as well. Yeah, and I was you.

01:17:22.647 --> 01:17:33.210
MATT: Pike goes, "Please?" She grabs your hand and
concentrates for a second, you watch as the holy

01:17:33.210 --> 01:17:40.175
symbol flares for a moment and the warmth passes
through her arms into your hand. And it feels

01:17:40.175 --> 01:17:45.850
nice. It's like holding a freshly heated cup of
tea. And as the spell completes and she pulls

01:17:45.850 --> 01:17:50.069
back. "That's all. Thank you."

01:17:50.069 --> 01:17:55.542
DARIN: Thank you, very kind of you. Don't ever do
that again.

01:17:55.542 --> 01:17:57.234
MATT: "Right, okay. Okay."

01:17:57.234 --> 01:18:08.995
SAM: Your companions. Not to bring up sad times.
How long ago did they go away? Perish?

01:18:08.995 --> 01:18:13.606
DARIN: 37 years.

01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:16.883
SAM: And how, was it in a fight?

01:18:16.883 --> 01:18:18.785
DARIN: Oh, yes.

01:18:18.785 --> 01:18:23.530
SAM: Against a powerful entity?

01:18:23.530 --> 01:18:33.260
DARIN: Oh no. Against ignorance, against bravery
that should never have been. And that's why I'm

01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:47.973
here and they're not, because I ran, you see. I'm
your future. You'll all be gone. You and you and

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:52.134
you and you and you, and you'll be left.

01:18:52.134 --> 01:18:58.986
LIAM: While listening to all that, Vax slid
his hand into Keyleth's and quietly listened to

01:18:58.986 --> 01:19:01.178
the whole thing.

01:19:01.178 --> 01:19:11.070
DARIN: Oh, well. Perhaps we should talk of other
things. Should we?

01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:19.536
SAM: Yes. Yes, we want this to be a positive visit
for you, so is there anything we can tell you from

01:19:19.536 --> 01:19:22.977
the world outside that you might be curious
about?

01:19:22.977 --> 01:19:28.726
DARIN: The world outside? Who needs the world
outside? I have everything here, and what I need,

01:19:28.726 --> 01:19:34.290
dear boy, I have taken from Kraghammer. All these
books over there, you see, those are mine. They

01:19:34.290 --> 01:19:40.232
should have been mine to begin with, and I took
them, and now they are mine. (wheezing laughter)

01:19:40.232 --> 01:19:43.649
TALIESIN: I'm going to peruse some of these
titles, quietly.

01:19:43.649 --> 01:19:45.218
SAM: The books, you mean?

01:19:45.218 --> 01:19:50.531
DARIN: Yes. You'd like to look at the books, would
you?

01:19:50.531 --> 01:19:53.672
TALIESIN: I find it's the easiest way to learn
quite a bit about a person.

01:19:53.672 --> 01:20:00.137
DARIN: Oh, you're very welcome to look at anything
you like. What will you give me, dear boy? I

01:20:00.137 --> 01:20:16.273
require something. And yet, what do I need, living
here? Not much. Intelligence, no. Secrets, no.

01:20:16.273 --> 01:20:33.571
Love, no. Sadness, bravery, power. What do you
have that you would give me?

01:20:33.571 --> 01:20:49.679
TRAVIS: I reach in the Bag of Holding. I take out
Percy's glasses. Would you care for a pair of

01:20:49.679 --> 01:20:52.492
these testicl-- spectacles?

01:20:52.492 --> 01:21:01.114
DARIN: I seek power, dear boy, not silliness. If I
wanted silliness, I would talk to a Sun Tree. No

01:21:01.114 --> 01:21:06.419
one ever should talk to a Sun Tree, they should
only listen to a Sun Tree. And so I shall say

01:21:06.419 --> 01:21:14.397
again, if you would like to peruse my book and
perhaps find what you are looking for, what will

01:21:14.397 --> 01:21:20.715
you give me that would bring power and redemption
into my life?

01:21:20.715 --> 01:21:23.303
SAM: What do you have, Grog?

01:21:23.303 --> 01:21:25.673
LAURA: (whispering) Give him some ale.

01:21:25.673 --> 01:21:28.006
TRAVIS: But that's not fucking power.

01:21:28.006 --> 01:21:31.222
LAURA: You don't know. Bet it's been a while since
he's had some of that.

01:21:31.222 --> 01:21:34.698
DARIN: It seems you have powerful items.

01:21:34.698 --> 01:21:40.955
TRAVIS: I do. I have these Bracers of Defense.

01:21:40.955 --> 01:21:47.779
DARIN: Ah, but that is strength. I require power.

01:21:47.779 --> 01:21:50.264
TRAVIS: (softly) Shit. Fuck.

01:21:50.264 --> 01:22:03.736
TALIESIN: Well, I reach into my bag and start
cleaning a small green shard of residuum,

01:22:03.736 --> 01:22:06.131
polishing it.

01:22:06.131 --> 01:22:16.154
DARIN: Demistrik! If you excuse me for a just--
while you look, I'll just talk to my imp. You'll

01:22:16.154 --> 01:22:19.230
pardon us. (whispering) A word, Demistrik?

01:22:19.230 --> 01:22:22.487
MATT: "Ugh. Just one moment. What?"

01:22:22.487 --> 01:22:28.711
DARIN: The big one worries me. I think we should
have a code in case we have to jump him.

01:22:28.711 --> 01:22:31.810
MATT: "What code would you wish?"

01:22:31.810 --> 01:22:37.828
DARIN: Goliath grab! But we need to remember that.
We need to remember that.

01:22:37.828 --> 01:22:39.563
MATT: "Goliath grab. Good luck!"

01:22:39.563 --> 01:22:47.668
DARIN: We need some sort of mnemonic device to
remember goliath grab. G, goodness gracious, grab

01:22:47.668 --> 01:22:52.267
that goliath. O?

01:22:52.267 --> 01:22:59.119
MATT: "O? Huh. I'll tell you what, I've got your
back."

01:22:59.119 --> 01:23:07.126
DARIN: I don't feel that at all. You're right in
front of me. How could you have my back? (wheezing chuckle)

01:23:07.126 --> 01:23:15.858
I got you. (laughing) Go away. So what do
you have for me? You've had ample time to look in

01:23:15.858 --> 01:23:18.839
your Bag of Holding to produce something very--

01:23:18.839 --> 01:23:25.679
TRAVIS: Powerful. Well, I do have one thing that
seems to be pretty powerful.

01:23:25.679 --> 01:23:28.728
MARISHA: Oh no, Grog.

01:23:28.728 --> 01:23:38.030
TRAVIS: I pull out of the Bag of Holding a small
leather case. I open the flap. I don't know if you

01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:45.391
have any interest in this, but my experience with
these items has been very extreme. Would you care

01:23:45.391 --> 01:23:48.500
to take a card?

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:51.655
DARIN: Would you care to give them to me?

01:23:51.655 --> 01:23:54.553
SAM: All or just one?

01:23:54.553 --> 01:23:57.028
TRAVIS: No, you can pick a card.

01:23:57.028 --> 01:24:06.680
MATT: Make an arcana check. Roll a d20 and add
your arcana skill modifier to it.

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:13.175
TALIESIN: You are a madman.

01:24:13.175 --> 01:24:15.613
DARIN: 15.

01:24:15.613 --> 01:24:21.718
MATT: 15. You don't recognize what he's holding in
his hands, but you immediately see the leather

01:24:21.718 --> 01:24:28.654
casing around it, and your essence being able to
read certain elements of magic-- It does appear to

01:24:28.654 --> 01:24:31.225
be a powerful enchantment, whatever he has
procured from the bag.

01:24:31.225 --> 01:24:34.972
DARIN: Indeed. Perhaps one card for one book?

01:24:34.972 --> 01:24:41.262
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure. I mean, Percy, do you have a
book out of all of these that you want to read?

01:24:41.262 --> 01:24:48.081
DARIN: What are you looking for? What do you seek?
What knowledge? I've got it all here.

01:24:48.081 --> 01:24:50.936
SAM: We seek a key.

01:24:50.936 --> 01:24:55.393
LAURA: To find a very ancient goddess--

01:24:55.393 --> 01:24:59.024
DARIN: Oh, don't say Ioun.

01:24:59.024 --> 01:25:02.859
TALIESIN: We're not going to say Ioun.

01:25:02.859 --> 01:25:04.494
DARIN: You just did!

01:25:04.494 --> 01:25:09.491
LIAM: Is there another name that you would like us
to use? Like a nickname instead of Ioun?

01:25:09.491 --> 01:25:20.471
DARIN: The Broken Goddess. I know more than Ioun,
please! Ioun. Gods, what do they know? We know

01:25:20.471 --> 01:25:30.409
more than they, for we exist! We live! We
adventure! They merely observe. Am I right?

01:25:30.409 --> 01:25:33.871
SAM: You have a point. They don't do much for us
in the day-to-day.

01:25:33.871 --> 01:25:35.708
TALIESIN: Are you saying you know more than Ioun?

01:25:35.708 --> 01:25:38.481
DARIN: Of course I know more than Ioun.

01:25:38.481 --> 01:25:41.168
TALIESIN: Can you prove that you know more than
Ioun?

01:25:41.168 --> 01:25:42.863
DARIN: Yes.

01:25:42.863 --> 01:25:47.389
TALIESIN: So if I ask you a question that is
almost impossible to answer, you could answer it

01:25:47.389 --> 01:25:49.945
before Ioun could answer it?

01:25:49.945 --> 01:25:54.502
DARIN: Could Ioun create a rock so heavy that even
she couldn't lift it?

01:25:54.502 --> 01:25:59.865
TALIESIN: Oh, please. I'm far too clever to ask
such a simple question. That's easy. I would have

01:25:59.865 --> 01:26:02.875
to ask something that was very difficult to
answer.

01:26:02.875 --> 01:26:07.105
DARIN: I will give you your answer if you give me
a card.

01:26:07.105 --> 01:26:12.289
LIAM: You know, I was just saying what a good idea
I thought it was, but I thought you were talking

01:26:12.289 --> 01:26:20.304
about the entire deck, Grog. I think the entire
deck is a fairer thing than to have him pull a

01:26:20.304 --> 01:26:23.664
card, because that seems unpredictable to me.

01:26:23.664 --> 01:26:25.587
TRAVIS: Yeah, that sounds perfect to me.

01:26:25.587 --> 01:26:31.390
LIAM: We're all in a small, enclosed space
together, Grog, and I like this fellow.

01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:37.836
LAURA: Sprigg, it is quite powerful, yes, but also
maybe slightly dangerous.

01:26:37.836 --> 01:26:39.989
TALIESIN: A bit dangerous, to be fair.

01:26:39.989 --> 01:26:48.177
DARIN: I'm here alone. Well, there's... oh, yes.
Go peddle your papers somewhere where they'd like

01:26:48.177 --> 01:26:49.886
papers peddled!

01:26:49.886 --> 01:26:51.814
LAURA: You're not alone at the moment.

01:26:51.814 --> 01:26:53.381
DARIN: That's true!

01:26:53.381 --> 01:27:04.849
LAURA: This is very true. And I'd rather not put
my life in the hands of you, not knowing you very

01:27:04.849 --> 01:27:05.814
well.

01:27:05.814 --> 01:27:09.507
DARIN: Some did. I'm here.

01:27:09.507 --> 01:27:10.625
LAURA: Yes.

01:27:10.625 --> 01:27:12.198
DARIN: They are not.

01:27:12.198 --> 01:27:15.633
LAURA: So something bad could happen, and you'd
run away, and we'd be stuck here?

01:27:15.633 --> 01:27:29.098
DARIN: No. 37 years. I ran away. I've been here
deciding how to live again, how &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to run away.

01:27:29.098 --> 01:27:38.254
That's what all this is about, isn't it? You can't
just hide from the world. I've done it! Done it

01:27:38.254 --> 01:27:50.887
for a long, long time. Maybe you being here means
that I should hide no longer. Or maybe I just have

01:27:50.887 --> 01:27:59.224
an invisible frog friend. Maybe I have nothing
here, and nothing here.

01:27:59.224 --> 01:28:06.080
TALIESIN: Whoever has devised these contraptions
and created this safety for you is a genius. I'm

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:08.227
not saying you're necessarily--

01:28:08.227 --> 01:28:11.024
DARIN: It was both of us.

01:28:11.024 --> 01:28:13.315
TALIESIN: I somehow don't think so.

01:28:13.315 --> 01:28:14.815
DARIN: What?

01:28:14.815 --> 01:28:17.007
MATT: "It was all me."

01:28:17.007 --> 01:28:22.001
TALIESIN: I've had my own demons to contend with
in my life, to make me doubt my own intelligence.

01:28:22.001 --> 01:28:28.154
I get the sense that your compatriot-- I hate to
call it friend, here--

01:28:28.154 --> 01:28:32.505
DARIN: I hate to call it friend, and yet I do.
Isn't that right, friend?

01:28:32.505 --> 01:28:34.428
MATT: "Unfortunately."

01:28:34.428 --> 01:28:36.485
TALIESIN: What are you doing here?

01:28:36.485 --> 01:28:40.748
DARIN: You can tell them.

01:28:40.748 --> 01:28:42.118
MATT: "No!"

01:28:42.118 --> 01:28:43.574
DARIN: Just tell him.

01:28:43.574 --> 01:28:45.632
MATT: "No! Why, because he asked me?"

01:28:45.632 --> 01:28:48.542
DARIN: Yes! Be polite. They're guests in our home.

01:28:48.583 --> 01:28:50.619
MATT: "Oh, it's not our home."

01:28:50.619 --> 01:28:56.123
DARIN: 19 years you've been here, ever since your
master died trying to enter and got tricked into

01:28:56.123 --> 01:29:00.143
one of my traps, and now you're here-- does that
answer your question?-- now, why don't you tell

01:29:00.143 --> 01:29:02.436
him what I just said?

01:29:02.436 --> 01:29:07.153
MATT: "My master died trying to get in here on
one of the traps, and now I call this my home."

01:29:07.153 --> 01:29:13.599
DARIN: Beautifully said. Bravo. You should be a
little performer in Kraghammer. You know what the

01:29:13.599 --> 01:29:24.350
reviews would be? Not very good! Shameful
behavior. Abysmal behavior from the Abyss itself!

01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:34.249
TALIESIN: We don't have much. Many of the things
that we carry are very dangerous. Obviously, you

01:29:34.249 --> 01:29:40.359
have a great deal of genius here. I'm going to
show him the elemental shard. I don't know if this

01:29:40.359 --> 01:29:44.973
would interest you, but I consider it to be of
great value.

01:29:44.973 --> 01:29:47.762
MATT: So you're showing him the residuum piece?

01:29:47.762 --> 01:29:49.487
TALIESIN: The last piece of residuum I have.

01:29:49.487 --> 01:29:55.379
MATT: All right. So this is a sliver of what looks
like green glass. It's finely polished, about that

01:29:55.379 --> 01:30:02.754
thick, that long. You've read about this. You've
read that condensed residuum is very susceptible

01:30:02.754 --> 01:30:12.164
to enchantment and/or the focusing of short-term
magic spells. It's expensive, it's lauded, it's

01:30:12.164 --> 01:30:13.739
hard to find.

01:30:13.739 --> 01:30:19.453
DARIN: I will use that Ring of Telekinesis to lift
it up and take a better look at it.

01:30:19.453 --> 01:30:24.798
MATT: You watch as it darts out of your hand and
wisps up, maybe two feet ahead of him, and slowly

01:30:24.798 --> 01:30:27.462
rotates above him as he inspects it.

01:30:27.462 --> 01:30:29.799
TALIESIN: Impressive, but not as impressive as the
giant log.

01:30:29.799 --> 01:30:37.650
DARIN: Oh, yes. But is there power in this, dear
boy? Or are there only secrets? For you are

01:30:37.650 --> 01:30:41.027
secrets. He is power.

01:30:41.027 --> 01:30:50.338
TALIESIN: I may be secrets, and that is of me, but
I believe there is power in its secret. People

01:30:50.338 --> 01:30:53.152
died for that. Many people.

01:30:53.152 --> 01:31:02.351
DARIN: People die every day. Except me. That's my
punishment, child. I live on. I live on with my

01:31:02.351 --> 01:31:05.567
shame and my intelligence and you.

01:31:05.567 --> 01:31:07.419
LAURA: Because of Ioun?

01:31:07.419 --> 01:31:11.904
MARISHA: What's your relationship to her?

01:31:11.904 --> 01:31:16.006
DARIN: What is anyone's relationship to a god?

01:31:16.006 --> 01:31:17.798
MARISHA: Good question.

01:31:17.798 --> 01:31:22.192
LAURA: Some of us are champions. Some of them
don't like them. Some of them worship them but

01:31:22.192 --> 01:31:24.662
don't really get respect. What's yours?

01:31:24.662 --> 01:31:27.805
DARIN: All of that and more.

01:31:27.805 --> 01:31:30.301
LAURA: So you're a champion? Are you a champion of
Ioun?

01:31:30.301 --> 01:31:35.005
MARISHA: You're a champion of Ioun. Of course he's
a champion of Ioun.

01:31:35.005 --> 01:31:37.716
DARIN: I wouldn't say that.

01:31:37.716 --> 01:31:42.467
TALIESIN: But we might, wouldn't we?

01:31:42.467 --> 01:31:46.185
DARIN: Champion of Ioun?

01:31:46.185 --> 01:31:50.033
MATT: (demonic cackling)

01:31:50.033 --> 01:31:54.420
DARIN: Are you going to start calling me Ioun's
Champion?

01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:59.456
MATT: "Only if it bothers you, Ioun's Champion!"

01:31:59.522 --> 01:32:10.287
DARIN: I like it. Drat, eh? Drat. You tell them
what you know of Ioun.

01:32:10.287 --> 01:32:14.189
MATT: "She's a heinous bitch who got what's coming
to her 800 years ago."

01:32:14.189 --> 01:32:15.770
MARISHA: What?

01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:24.880
DARIN: It's a bit common, but that is his belief.
What is yours? What is your thought about Ioun?

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:32.423
SAM: We know that she possesses knowledge that
could help us in our quest to save the world, and

01:32:32.423 --> 01:32:38.520
therefore, no matter what her personality is, she
is valuable to us.

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:50.585
DARIN: And yet, is there value in saving the
world? Or should you just let it all go away?

01:32:50.585 --> 01:32:53.593
LAURA: No, no, I think we should save it.

01:32:53.593 --> 01:32:55.772
SAM: Yeah, we're pro-world here.

01:32:55.772 --> 01:32:59.998
DARIN: Are you? That is interesting.

01:32:59.998 --> 01:33:02.415
LIAM: Sprigg, you're seeking power.

01:33:02.415 --> 01:33:07.930
DARIN: I seek redemption. There is great power in
redemption.

01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:23.899
LIAM: We offer you redemption. Collaborating with
us grants you the power to fell a would-be god.

01:33:23.899 --> 01:33:30.193
DARIN: Excuse me. For one second. Can I speak to
you for just a second?

01:33:30.193 --> 01:33:34.318
MATT: (flapping wings) "What?"

01:33:34.318 --> 01:33:43.527
DARIN: He's tricky. I think we should get a
mnemonic device on what we need to do if he

01:33:43.527 --> 01:33:53.304
becomes too tricky. We should say, elf boy grab!
E! For egads! There's an elf, we should grab him.

01:33:53.304 --> 01:33:57.530
L! Let's grab that elf boy.

01:33:57.530 --> 01:34:01.361
MATT: "Right, all right." You guys can hear all of
this.

01:34:01.361 --> 01:34:05.945
DARIN: F. Forsooth, I shall grab this elf boy!

01:34:05.945 --> 01:34:11.303
LIAM: I'm not an elf. Not an elf.

01:34:11.303 --> 01:34:14.087
MARISHA: Why do people like calling you elf boy
and elf girl?

01:34:14.087 --> 01:34:21.729
LIAM: We have vaguely pointed ears. Not even
fully pointed ears. My mother was not an elf.

01:34:21.729 --> 01:34:29.287
DARIN: Just a second. He's not an elf!

01:34:29.287 --> 01:34:33.795
MATT: "We'll stick with the device. I've got your
back."

01:34:33.795 --> 01:34:35.521
DARIN: I still don't feel it.

01:34:35.521 --> 01:34:36.989
MATT: "You will."

01:34:36.989 --> 01:34:44.510
DARIN: All right. Hello!

01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:49.518
SAM: Hi. Hi, mirror man. Listen.

01:34:49.518 --> 01:34:50.976
DARIN: All right.

01:34:50.976 --> 01:34:54.942
SAM: Let's cut to the chase here. We need
information from you.

01:34:54.942 --> 01:34:56.229
DARIN: Indeed.

01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:59.044
SAM: You need something from us. Grog, give him a
card.

01:34:59.044 --> 01:35:01.315
MARISHA: Wait.

01:35:01.315 --> 01:35:05.493
SAM: We're dancing around this! We need this man!

01:35:05.493 --> 01:35:08.054
LAURA: He took the stone! Are you taking the
stone?

01:35:08.054 --> 01:35:10.880
SAM: Are you going to take the stone as a source
of power? He said it's too mysterious.

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:14.885
LIAM: I thought we were talking about redemption.

01:35:14.885 --> 01:35:20.055
DARIN: If you'll allow me. You've been very
quiet.

01:35:20.055 --> 01:35:28.036
MARISHA: Yes, I'm a little freaked out right now.
You're my worst fear incarnate. Sorry, that seemed

01:35:28.036 --> 01:35:31.191
very rude. My worst nightmare incarnate.

01:35:31.191 --> 01:35:33.459
DARIN: That didn't make it any better, dear
child!

01:35:33.459 --> 01:35:35.400
MATT: (cackling)

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:43.213
DARIN: (shushing) Go ahead. Why am I your worst
fear in a carnation?

01:35:43.213 --> 01:35:50.979
MARISHA: I've seen you in my dreams.

01:35:50.979 --> 01:35:54.622
DARIN: Hear that?

01:35:54.622 --> 01:35:59.133
MATT: "Go get her, tiger."

01:35:59.133 --> 01:36:03.077
LAURA: Trinket starts chasing the imp around the
room.

01:36:03.077 --> 01:36:08.455
MATT: "No!" Up into the corner, (hissing). Turns
invisible.

01:36:08.455 --> 01:36:11.324
DARIN: Oh, I guess you found that unbearable!

01:36:11.324 --> 01:36:13.398
SAM: That was a good pun.

01:36:13.398 --> 01:36:17.145
MATT: You hear the tiniest little demonic fart by
your ear.

01:36:17.145 --> 01:36:22.772
LIAM: I'm also gently steering Trinket away from
the floorboard in the middle of the room as he

01:36:22.772 --> 01:36:24.316
walked by.

01:36:24.316 --> 01:36:30.263
MARISHA: Somehow everything you have said since
the minute we've walked into this building has

01:36:30.263 --> 01:36:36.167
made 100% sense, and I think that's what scares me
the most, is I understand everything you've said.

01:36:36.167 --> 01:36:46.582
DARIN: It should scare you the most. I was one of
you. I did what you did. 37 years ago, I did it.

01:36:46.582 --> 01:36:52.030
And we fought, and we fought, and they were right
here. They were right here!

01:36:52.030 --> 01:36:54.116
SAM: Who is they?

01:36:54.116 --> 01:36:55.520
DARIN: My companions.

01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:59.402
SAM: And who were you fighting against? You, we?

01:36:59.402 --> 01:37:01.067
TRAVIS: Vecna.

01:37:01.067 --> 01:37:02.801
DARIN: No.

01:37:02.801 --> 01:37:04.168
SAM: Gods?

01:37:04.168 --> 01:37:11.268
DARIN: It was silly. It was hobgoblins. It should
never have happened. It was a simple fight, and

01:37:11.268 --> 01:37:19.602
they died, and I ran, and I can't even remember
their names.

01:37:19.602 --> 01:37:21.900
LIAM: Sprigg.

01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:23.297
DARIN: Yes?

01:37:23.297 --> 01:37:30.572
LIAM: Would you like to be needed again? Maybe
it's time to stop running.

01:37:30.572 --> 01:37:34.125
DARIN: What would I do?

01:37:34.169 --> 01:37:42.940
MARISHA: We can grant you power in items, but I
don't want to speak for all of us, but I think all

01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:50.847
of us can speak a little bit to the fact that
items don't grant you as much inner power as you

01:37:50.847 --> 01:37:52.320
expect them to.

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:54.702
LAURA: Unless they're boots. And then they're
amazing.

01:37:54.702 --> 01:38:01.331
MARISHA: Unless they're very highly argued and
debated-upon boots, in which case I still think

01:38:01.331 --> 01:38:02.479
the argument--

01:38:02.479 --> 01:38:06.287
DARIN: Are we about to have a debate about boots?
I'm against them! Your turn.

01:38:06.287 --> 01:38:09.019
LAURA: I am for them, usually.

01:38:09.019 --> 01:38:12.333
DARIN: Continue, Councilor, but watch yourself.

01:38:12.385 --> 01:38:17.783
LAURA: Have you any idea where the key to Ioun
is?

01:38:17.783 --> 01:38:20.488
DARIN: In the boots? We're talking about boots,
are we?

01:38:20.488 --> 01:38:25.232
LAURA: Yes. Boots that hold a key to Ioun's
location. Specifically.

01:38:25.232 --> 01:38:32.966
DARIN: I think the key might be here, but I don't
really know.

01:38:32.966 --> 01:38:42.783
LIAM: Sprigg, the world is on the brink right now.
It's worse than hobgoblins. We've come here in

01:38:42.783 --> 01:38:51.276
great need, and the world is in great need, and
the power that I offer you is making a

01:38:51.276 --> 01:38:52.636
difference.

01:38:52.636 --> 01:39:00.217
DARIN: Then make me believe in Ioun. We'll make a
difference together.

01:39:00.217 --> 01:39:02.474
LIAM: Make you believe?

01:39:02.474 --> 01:39:07.183
MARISHA: Of course he believes. Believing is not
the question.

01:39:07.183 --> 01:39:13.895
DARIN: Books everywhere, you see. That's something
you can hold. That's something you can learn.

01:39:13.895 --> 01:39:18.931
MARISHA: That's something that's tangible. Ioun is
distant.

01:39:18.931 --> 01:39:24.250
LAURA: But she could be tangible if you'd help us
find her.

01:39:24.250 --> 01:39:32.120
MARISHA: What if we have found her? What if Sprigg
is right? What if all of the information that Ioun

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:34.384
knows is here in Sprigg?

01:39:34.384 --> 01:39:39.983
TALIESIN: I really want to look at these. I want
to look at these books really quickly. I'm having

01:39:39.983 --> 01:39:44.378
a moment. I just want to start looking at these
titles. What are these books?

01:39:44.378 --> 01:39:49.094
MATT: You go over and start walking towards the
edge of the nearest bookcase, and all of you at

01:39:49.094 --> 01:40:01.949
once-- everyone but Sprigg, actually-- suddenly
hear a voice come through, filling your mind,

01:40:01.949 --> 01:40:07.684
filling your consciousness, filling your ears.
Sourceless, delivered to your consciousness

01:40:07.684 --> 01:40:20.253
directly. "Thank you for showing me where he is."
And that's where we're going to take a break.

01:40:20.253 --> 01:40:24.047
LIAM: Fuck!

01:40:24.047 --> 01:40:30.159
MARISHA: How? We don't have the eye! What a cock!

01:40:30.159 --> 01:40:35.086
TALIESIN: Oh my god, he's been in the troll dick
all along.

01:40:35.086 --> 01:40:37.166
MARISHA: It's always been the troll dick.

01:40:37.166 --> 01:40:42.402
MATT: All right, we'll be in just a minute. We'll
be back here in a few minutes, guys. For the

01:40:42.402 --> 01:40:50.342
Twitch giveaway, we have this awesome Peruvian
walnut dice tray, leather interior. It's very

01:40:50.342 --> 01:40:54.456
nice. It's the same type that I have, actually,
back here, which is nice. Giving it away for

01:40:54.456 --> 01:41:00.917
somebody in the Twitch chat, so run on over, and
the code for the evening is Sprigg. S-P-R-I...

01:41:00.917 --> 01:41:02.354
DARIN: G-G.

01:41:02.354 --> 01:41:03.788
MATT: G-G. Double G.

01:41:03.788 --> 01:41:08.364
DARIN: S-P-R-I-G-G spells Sprigg, ladies and
gentlemen, if you want to win that valuable

01:41:08.364 --> 01:41:09.502
prize.

01:41:09.502 --> 01:41:13.324
MATT: So pay attention in the chat. When it's time
to, go ahead and enter Sprigg into the chat, and

01:41:13.324 --> 01:41:16.709
one lucky winner will be announced when we get
back here. See you guys in a few minutes!

01:41:16.709 --> 02:01:14.980
[break]

02:01:14.980 --> 02:01:18.326
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. All
right, so first and foremost, we have our winner

02:01:18.365 --> 02:01:26.614
for the dice tray from Wyrmwood. That is our
friend k0sn1ght, spelled in the way that you spell your

02:01:26.614 --> 02:01:35.401
XBox Live name: k0sn1ght. Congratulations, you are
the winner. Go ahead and contact Danoba and get

02:01:35.401 --> 02:01:38.990
your information and we'll get that shipped out to
you. Bringing us back in.

02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:40.908
TALIESIN: That was fast.

02:01:40.908 --> 02:01:48.297
MATT: Last we left off, you all, almost all of
you, heard a singular familiar voice. The low,

02:01:48.297 --> 02:01:58.644
gravelly undead voice of The Whispered One fills
your minds, saying, "Thank you for showing me

02:01:58.644 --> 02:02:08.441
"where he is." In that moment where you all pause
in place, you hear a series of simultaneous sounds

02:02:08.441 --> 02:02:18.414
(arrows firing) as a number of heavy crossbow
bolts from nearby windows all fire simultaneously

02:02:18.414 --> 02:02:20.914
at Sprigg.

02:02:20.914 --> 02:02:23.712
MARISHA: Do I have time for a reaction?

02:02:23.712 --> 02:02:26.448
MATT: No, you do not. This is a surprise round.

02:02:26.448 --> 02:02:28.685
LIAM: This is the sound of bolts, no.

02:02:28.685 --> 02:02:31.779
TRAVIS: It's all right, he can't die. It's cool.
We're all right.

02:02:31.779 --> 02:02:37.377
MATT: So that first one is a 24. What's your armor
class?

02:02:37.377 --> 02:02:39.679
DARIN: My armor class is 19.

02:02:39.679 --> 02:02:49.860
MATT: Okay! So you take 23 points of piercing
damage.

02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:55.650
DARIN: Okay. Oh, there we go.

02:02:55.650 --> 02:03:01.345
MATT: That's 17. That misses you. It strikes your
shoulder and glances off. One bolt sinks into your

02:03:01.345 --> 02:03:06.019
chest and you look down and you see it's this big,
long heavy metal bolt and it's jutting out from

02:03:06.019 --> 02:03:10.238
the side of where your shoulder and pec is.
Another one rushes by and glances off your other

02:03:10.238 --> 02:03:11.815
shoulder. The third one--

02:03:11.815 --> 02:03:13.503
DARIN: Well, this is different.

02:03:13.503 --> 02:03:26.139
MATT: That hits. That's a 25. That's 23 points of
piercing damage.

02:03:26.139 --> 02:03:28.737
TALIESIN: Oh no.

02:03:28.737 --> 02:03:33.098
MATT: That one actually misses; a six and a one.
It slams into one of the nearby books right behind

02:03:33.098 --> 02:03:45.354
you, barely moving past your cheek. Fifth one,
that is a 19 exactly, so you take 24 points of

02:03:45.354 --> 02:03:46.386
damage.

02:03:46.386 --> 02:03:48.059
LAURA: How many fucking bolts are there?

02:03:48.059 --> 02:03:49.327
MARISHA: 24?

02:03:49.327 --> 02:03:57.770
MATT: They're all sneak attack. And that is 20.

02:03:57.770 --> 02:03:59.337
DARIN: Another one?

02:03:59.337 --> 02:04:00.471
MATT: Another one.

02:04:00.471 --> 02:04:01.619
DARIN: Okay.

02:04:01.619 --> 02:04:07.594
MATT: That one's going to be 26 points of piercing
damage.

02:04:07.594 --> 02:04:09.228
DARIN: I'm gone.

02:04:09.228 --> 02:04:14.964
MATT: You guys watch as all these bolts (arrows
firing and impacting) into Sprigg's body and

02:04:14.964 --> 02:04:21.099
Sprigg falls back, unconscious on the side of the
room. I'm going to bring out a map now.

02:04:21.099 --> 02:04:24.643
DARIN: Fly, you fools!

02:04:24.643 --> 02:04:27.976
MARISHA: (yelling) No, Sprigg!

02:04:27.976 --> 02:04:34.065
SAM: Darin, it was really great having you on.
Thanks so much.

02:04:34.065 --> 02:04:35.580
LAURA: Whoa, cool!

02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:38.648
SAM: Whoa, this is a cute house!

02:04:38.648 --> 02:04:41.654
LAURA: Oh, I can't see inside of it.

02:04:41.654 --> 02:04:44.436
MATT: Moving the top floor off.

02:04:44.436 --> 02:04:46.608
LIAM: There's crates of apples!

02:04:46.608 --> 02:04:51.488
SAM: There's a sack of something in the corner! Oh
my god, how are we all going to fit in there?

02:04:51.488 --> 02:05:02.033
MATT: Sprigg is currently unconscious on the
ground there. Percival was there talking. Trinket

02:05:02.033 --> 02:05:03.338
is off to the side.

02:05:03.338 --> 02:05:05.455
LAURA: Trinket! Where's the imp?

02:05:05.455 --> 02:05:14.679
MATT: The imp is not currently visible. Pike would
be over on the side here. Keyleth, Vax, where

02:05:14.679 --> 02:05:17.707
would you guys see yourselves right now? Actually,
tell me where you would be. I think that's what

02:05:17.707 --> 02:05:18.902
I'm trying to ask.

02:05:18.902 --> 02:05:20.903
LIAM: I would be right next to Keyleth because I
was holding her hand.

02:05:20.903 --> 02:05:22.737
MATT: As I chuck you onto the ground.

02:05:22.737 --> 02:05:24.711
LIAM: It's all right. It's fine.

02:05:24.859 --> 02:05:29.102
MATT: Yeah, comes back in a day later. All right,
cool. So you're there holding that. Scanlan, where

02:05:29.150 --> 02:05:30.047
would you be?

02:05:30.047 --> 02:05:31.413
SAM: Near Sprigg-ish.

02:05:31.413 --> 02:05:33.459
MATT: All right, so I'll put you right there next
to the scroll in the ground.

02:05:33.459 --> 02:05:39.510
LIAM: And Matt? Could you touch on the map where
the bad man touched you? No, where the bad

02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:40.766
floorboard is?

02:05:40.766 --> 02:05:43.975
MATT: Yes, actually, I can do that.

02:05:44.030 --> 02:05:46.118
LIAM: None of you know this.

02:05:46.118 --> 02:05:49.954
MATT: None of you know this, except for you, which
is actually why I'm not going to show you. You

02:05:49.954 --> 02:05:52.151
know how to avoid it, but nobody else knows where
it is.

02:05:52.151 --> 02:05:56.058
LAURA: Where is the front door?

02:05:56.058 --> 02:05:58.043
MATT: The front door is right there.

02:05:58.043 --> 02:06:00.292
LIAM: There, over by Grog on your right.

02:06:00.292 --> 02:06:02.918
SAM: These trees need to move.

02:06:02.918 --> 02:06:09.625
LAURA: I know, these trees are a pain in our
butts. Oh no.

02:06:09.625 --> 02:06:12.267
SAM: There's cloaked men everywhere

02:06:12.267 --> 02:06:18.077
MATT: You watch as one that was up in the stairs
vanishes up top.

02:06:18.077 --> 02:06:22.064
TRAVIS: Oh, he actually made it upstairs?

02:06:22.064 --> 02:06:26.239
MATT: He fired, and then ducked up there. I need
everyone to roll initiative.

02:06:26.239 --> 02:06:27.659
SAM: Initiative?

02:06:27.659 --> 02:06:30.351
MATT: Yes. Including you, even though you're on
the ground.

02:06:30.351 --> 02:06:35.901
MARISHA: Don't. Fuck. Me. Gil. It's fine. Gil did
all right.

02:06:35.901 --> 02:06:40.668
SAM: I don't trust Gil. I never roll on his dice.

02:06:40.668 --> 02:06:48.185
LIAM: Rarely. I have, but I got my Matt Colville
meteorite.

02:06:48.185 --> 02:06:49.279
MATT: 25 to 20?

02:06:49.349 --> 02:06:50.453
TALIESIN: 23.

02:06:50.453 --> 02:06:51.599
LIAM: 20.

02:06:51.599 --> 02:06:52.629
TRAVIS: 22.

02:06:52.629 --> 02:07:06.605
MATT: Oh wow, so we have Percy, we have Grog, and
Vax. Okay, 20 to 15?

02:07:06.605 --> 02:07:08.361
SAM: 19.

02:07:08.361 --> 02:07:10.055
LAURA: Should somebody roll for Pike?

02:07:10.055 --> 02:07:12.132
MATT: Yes, actually. Okay, yeah.

02:07:12.132 --> 02:07:15.802
DARIN: Also a 19.

02:07:15.802 --> 02:07:17.032
MATT: Okay.

02:07:17.032 --> 02:07:19.456
TALIESIN: You've got a very low initiative bonus.

02:07:19.456 --> 02:07:25.018
MATT: All righty, anybody else?

02:07:25.018 --> 02:07:26.488
LAURA: 13.

02:07:26.488 --> 02:07:34.713
MARISHA: 12. I don't know why I did deuces. 12.

02:07:34.713 --> 02:07:36.329
TALIESIN: Peace out.

02:07:36.329 --> 02:07:38.754
SAM: NKOTB.

02:07:38.754 --> 02:07:42.505
MARISHA: 12 initiative, Wu Tang out.

02:07:42.505 --> 02:07:44.612
TALIESIN: That's our next shirt.

02:07:44.612 --> 02:07:48.819
SAM: Quidd, everyone. Quidd.

02:07:48.819 --> 02:07:50.068
LAURA: Quidd.

02:07:50.068 --> 02:07:51.827
LIAM: Quid pro quo.

02:07:51.827 --> 02:07:55.761
MATT: All right, so top of the combat round. The
surprise round is done, you watch Sprigg fall to

02:07:55.761 --> 02:07:59.980
the ground, bolts sticking out of the side of the
neck, the shoulder, and the body. Unconscious, now

02:07:59.980 --> 02:08:05.490
beginning to pool blood underneath where he's
bleeding out, and you glance around and you see a

02:08:05.552 --> 02:08:12.053
series of shaded figures in the windows that all
dart out of the way.

02:08:12.053 --> 02:08:14.545
MARISHA: Cowards.

02:08:14.545 --> 02:08:15.914
LAURA: Dicks.

02:08:15.914 --> 02:08:20.684
SAM: Oh, they left. The fight's over, everyone.

02:08:20.684 --> 02:08:23.264
MATT: Percy, you're up first.

02:08:23.264 --> 02:08:41.728
TALIESIN: Wow, this is a lot that happened. I'm
going to click my boots, and I'm going to run up

02:08:41.728 --> 02:08:43.737
the wall and run upstairs.

02:08:43.737 --> 02:08:53.264
MATT: Which, for the purposes of this, I will
place the upstairs over here. So as you dart up,

02:08:53.264 --> 02:09:00.684
Percival, you run up the stairway there where the
one guy you saw was standing.

02:09:00.684 --> 02:09:02.172
TALIESIN: Is he right there?

02:09:02.172 --> 02:09:07.557
MATT: Yeah, he ducked out of the way, and there's
also one figure that you recognize from the

02:09:07.618 --> 02:09:13.503
Shadowfell earlier. You see one of the ghastly
creatures that was darting through the ruins

02:09:13.503 --> 02:09:20.402
leaping from from rooftop to rooftop. Its skin is
grayish and long, its limbs lanky, its fingers

02:09:20.402 --> 02:09:24.444
curled into claws, and this long tongue dangling
from his jaws, it's getting ready to run down the

02:09:24.444 --> 02:09:26.995
stairs as you charge him, and it goes (growls).

02:09:26.995 --> 02:09:28.639
TALIESIN: Manners! Action Surge!

02:09:28.639 --> 02:09:32.760
MARISHA: Yay, Manners!

02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:34.380
MATT: Okay then.

02:09:34.380 --> 02:09:36.806
MARISHA: We're bad at manners, until now!

02:09:36.806 --> 02:09:40.430
MATT: All righty, so what's the saving throw on
that one?

02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:49.399
TALIESIN: It's a DC 20 strength. Oh, I'm sorry,
no. Never mind. It's an attack roll.

02:09:49.399 --> 02:09:52.123
MATT: Okay, so you have to roll first to see if
you hit it.

02:09:52.123 --> 02:09:58.263
TALIESIN: 18.

02:09:58.263 --> 02:10:05.224
MATT: 18? Yeah, that definitely hits. It hits, and
you watch as you pull the sphere out and chuck it in

02:10:05.224 --> 02:10:10.524
the direction of the creature. Pulls its claws back,
slams into its chest, and then unravels.

02:10:10.524 --> 02:10:18.594
It falls to the ground, prone, unable
to move, right there in the middle of the floor.

02:10:18.594 --> 02:10:21.164
TALIESIN: Just making sure that I can do this.

02:10:21.164 --> 02:10:23.133
MATT: Was that your action, there, doing that?

02:10:23.133 --> 02:10:28.291
TALIESIN: That was my action surge. I can only do
one round. Just seeing if I have anything at a bonus that

02:10:28.341 --> 02:10:29.430
I can do.

02:10:29.430 --> 02:10:31.108
MATT: You spent your action--?

02:10:31.108 --> 02:10:39.008
TALIESIN: My action, I activated my boots. My
action surge activating that. Do I have anything I

02:10:39.008 --> 02:10:40.843
can do with a bonus action?

02:10:40.843 --> 02:10:42.204
MATT: Not really.

02:10:42.204 --> 02:10:50.046
TALIESIN: I'm going to turn to the other guy and
pull the ripcord on the glove angrily. (revving)

02:10:50.046 --> 02:10:53.350
MATT: You load up Diplomacy. Good. That's your
turn, Percy. Grog, you're up.

02:10:53.350 --> 02:10:56.477
TRAVIS: Me? Oh? Can I go into a rage?

02:10:56.477 --> 02:10:57.687
MATT: Yes, you may.

02:10:57.687 --> 02:11:00.040
TRAVIS: And he fell where?

02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:03.765
MATT: He fell right there, on the ground,
currently bleeding out.

02:11:03.765 --> 02:11:11.595
TRAVIS: Can I run over to Sprigg and shove a--
should I shove a health potion in his throat?

02:11:11.595 --> 02:11:13.359
LAURA: Well, we've got healers.

02:11:13.359 --> 02:11:19.674
TRAVIS: Right. I'll run upstairs to see where Percy
went.

02:11:19.674 --> 02:11:25.181
MATT: You rage-run just past Percival and you see
there's one creature bound on the ground and

02:11:25.181 --> 02:11:29.919
there's another guy who's there with his crossbow,
he's trying to reload, who sees Percival and is

02:11:29.996 --> 02:11:32.346
getting ready to pull it up as you leap in front.

02:11:32.346 --> 02:11:33.733
TALIESIN: Smash him!

02:11:33.733 --> 02:11:34.696
TRAVIS: Do you mind?

02:11:34.696 --> 02:11:35.753
TALIESIN: Please!

02:11:35.753 --> 02:11:37.231
TRAVIS: Yeah. (rage noises)

02:11:37.231 --> 02:11:39.762
MATT: Go for it. Roll for a double attack.

02:11:39.762 --> 02:11:48.199
TRAVIS: Reckless! Not Great Weapon Master.
Two-handed with the Dwarven Thrower. That's a lot.

02:11:48.199 --> 02:11:53.432
30, minus-- oh, there is no minus. 32.

02:11:53.432 --> 02:11:55.684
MATT: 32 hits. Second attack?

02:11:55.684 --> 02:12:00.639
TRAVIS: 31.

02:12:00.639 --> 02:12:02.690
MATT: Hits. Go ahead and roll damage for both.

02:12:02.690 --> 02:12:10.775
TRAVIS: So they're not giants. So I just roll a
d10. That's a ten. Rage damage. 25.

02:12:10.775 --> 02:12:12.688
MATT: 25 damage on the first hit?

02:12:12.688 --> 02:12:14.829
TRAVIS: On the first one. Second one.

02:12:14.829 --> 02:12:17.417
LAURA: 24.

02:12:17.417 --> 02:12:19.222
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:12:19.222 --> 02:12:26.093
MATT: Nice. With your hammer, two hands, whack
right across the side of its head. You see the jaw

02:12:26.093 --> 02:12:32.676
unhinge from the side. As he pulls back, it's
hanging loosely there, and the second hit you

02:12:32.676 --> 02:12:36.419
clock right in the side of the temple, and it
nearly goes unconscious, and picks itself up

02:12:36.419 --> 02:12:41.677
again, gets its crossbow ready. It's still
holding. It's not down yet, but it's hurt badly.

02:12:41.677 --> 02:12:46.958
You can see now, up close, you can see these
figures, they're dressed in very, very tight black

02:12:46.958 --> 02:12:50.719
leathers, cloaks enshrouding their body, the hood
is still up, but you've knocked it back. There you

02:12:50.719 --> 02:12:59.764
see a human male in his late 40s, early 50s, the
head shaved completely bald, a tattoo of black

02:12:59.764 --> 02:13:02.857
tendrils around the left eye, and the left eye is
missing from the socket.

02:13:02.857 --> 02:13:06.174
TRAVIS: Black tendrils? Okay, cool. That's my
turn.

02:13:06.174 --> 02:13:08.522
MATT: That's your turn. All right. Grog's done.
Vax, you're up.

02:13:08.522 --> 02:13:12.955
LIAM: Okay, let's talk this out. Click the Boots
of Haste. I think, with 120 feet of movement, I

02:13:12.955 --> 02:13:19.470
can blur up the stairs to where Percy is in
probably 50 or 60 feet. And then finish that

02:13:19.470 --> 02:13:29.407
movement and go past the guy, out the window, with
all of my movement in 120 feet or less. Okay, so

02:13:29.407 --> 02:13:30.559
I'm doing that.

02:13:30.559 --> 02:13:33.120
MATT: There's also a window here, a window here,
and a window here. Just so you guys know, and a

02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:34.538
window here, if you wanted.

02:13:34.538 --> 02:13:40.211
LIAM: Definitely understand. Blur up the stairs,
shoot past Percy, shoot past that guy, out the

02:13:40.211 --> 02:13:41.297
window.

02:13:41.297 --> 02:13:43.788
MATT: You're on the balcony now, looking right about
here.

02:13:43.788 --> 02:13:45.506
LIAM: Do I already see those guys?

02:13:45.506 --> 02:13:48.276
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:13:48.276 --> 02:13:51.998
LIAM: 19 plus 14 is a hell of a lot.

02:13:51.998 --> 02:13:57.174
MATT: 19 plus 14? Yeah, you do see them. And you
glance down, you can see they're hiding amongst

02:13:57.174 --> 02:14:02.116
bushes, and they're specifically stealthed. But
you're keen of eye enough to see where they're

02:14:02.116 --> 02:14:02.964
placed.

02:14:02.964 --> 02:14:11.917
LIAM: I stealth, hide. Bonus action to hide. I'm
going to use Luck. That's better. 27.

02:14:11.917 --> 02:14:15.415
MATT: 27. Okay. You're not sure if they see you or
not.

02:14:15.415 --> 02:14:20.721
LIAM: All right, then from this spot, if they're
in range, I'm going to throw Whisper at one of

02:14:20.721 --> 02:14:21.817
them.

02:14:21.817 --> 02:14:29.997
MATT: Right now, you are currently up here. So you
glance off and you can barely see one that's over

02:14:29.997 --> 02:14:33.342
the edge of the roof right there. That's the only
one you can see.

02:14:33.342 --> 02:14:37.514
LIAM: But I can see them and I can ignore
three-quarters cover because of Sharpshooter.

02:14:37.514 --> 02:14:43.663
MATT: So you barely see the edge of one there.
Sharpshooter. I'd say yeah, you can. You can hit

02:14:43.663 --> 02:14:45.075
both, if you want.

02:14:45.075 --> 02:14:51.777
LIAM: So the one that I can see, hidden, I will try
to throw Whisper. I'm going to hopefully sneak

02:14:51.777 --> 02:14:57.123
attack him and bamf there. That is a 28.

02:14:57.123 --> 02:15:03.203
MATT: 28. He does not see you. So you have
advantage on that if you want to roll again.

02:15:03.203 --> 02:15:05.187
LIAM: Right. Natural 20.

02:15:05.187 --> 02:15:08.916
TALIESIN: Turn him into paste.

02:15:08.916 --> 02:15:24.593
LIAM: Okay. (counting)

02:15:24.593 --> 02:15:25.714
SAM: Did Pike roll?

02:15:25.714 --> 02:15:27.016
MATT: Pike did.

02:15:27.016 --> 02:15:28.419
LAURA: What did she get?

02:15:28.419 --> 02:15:30.354
MATT: 11. Typical Pike.

02:15:30.354 --> 02:15:31.934
MARISHA: She's after me.

02:15:31.934 --> 02:15:37.324
LAURA: Well, no, but Sprigg is right after Scanlan.
He's before we are. So I'd rather get him up

02:15:37.324 --> 02:15:38.555
before.

02:15:38.555 --> 02:15:43.527
LIAM: So that one is 60 on that guy.

02:15:43.527 --> 02:15:45.454
MATT: 60 points of damage?

02:15:45.454 --> 02:15:47.297
LIAM: Yes, and I bamf there.

02:15:47.297 --> 02:15:56.582
MATT: As you chuck the dagger, like right towards
where the center of the shoulderblades connect in

02:15:56.582 --> 02:16:00.622
the back he (groans) and you watch as the crossbow
that he had drops to the ground and he crumples

02:16:00.622 --> 02:16:05.310
over on top of it, but he slowly starts getting to
his feet out of the bushes. He looks really hurt,

02:16:05.310 --> 02:16:09.274
but he's still standing. And you appear right next
to him there.

02:16:09.274 --> 02:16:16.572
LIAM: So I did movement, I hid for my bonus, I
have action-action as a paladin. And action.

02:16:16.572 --> 02:16:18.170
MATT: You have attack-attack as a paladin.

02:16:18.170 --> 02:16:21.260
LIAM: Attack-attack as a paladin. And then my
bonus action. That was the first of attack-attack,

02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:24.921
so now I'll just do a regular attack, which is a
20--

02:16:24.921 --> 02:16:30.147
LAURA: (sarcastically) I'm so glad he got those
boots back, I'm just so glad.

02:16:30.147 --> 02:16:31.533
LIAM: 30.

02:16:31.533 --> 02:16:33.682
MATT: 30 hits.

02:16:33.682 --> 02:16:42.375
LIAM: That is a ten and I'm going to pump him full
of poison. He has to make a DC check on 15.

02:16:42.375 --> 02:16:46.829
MATT: That is a seven. No. Four plus three.

02:16:46.829 --> 02:16:56.046
LIAM: So he also gets, that was ten plus 14 total.
20 total, between the dagger and the poison.

02:16:56.046 --> 02:17:01.796
MATT: So the second dagger, you shiv him in the
side and he (groans) goes to spin with the heavy

02:17:01.796 --> 02:17:06.879
crossbow and try and pull away, and as soon as the poison
through him he goes, (gurgles) and you can see

02:17:06.879 --> 02:17:10.998
blood vomit down the front of his chest, his eyes
roll back and he twinges and falls to the ground.

02:17:10.998 --> 02:17:15.389
LIAM: And there's another guy there who can see
me, right?

02:17:15.389 --> 02:17:19.233
MATT: Yeah, and he's hidden, but he's like
(scared, heavy breathing).

02:17:19.233 --> 02:17:21.636
LIAM: Whisper.

02:17:21.636 --> 02:17:24.757
MATT: Okay, he's trying to see that you're not
being seen.

02:17:24.757 --> 02:17:41.528
LIAM: That is 31. Yeah, okay. So that is two plus
eight is ten, plus psychic damage. 18. I'm going

02:17:41.528 --> 02:17:43.284
to bamf there with Whisper.

02:17:43.284 --> 02:17:54.077
MATT: Okay. All righty. You hit him and you stand
there. You're right in front of him now. All

02:17:54.077 --> 02:18:02.547
righty. That ends your go. As you appear over on
the other side, you realize that over in the

02:18:02.547 --> 02:18:08.251
clearing there, there is another one of the robed
figures, this one clutching a long, black, smooth

02:18:08.251 --> 02:18:11.595
staff that crooks over in the front that looks
like a hand holding an eye.

02:18:11.595 --> 02:18:13.236
MARISHA: What? Where? Who?

02:18:13.236 --> 02:18:17.310
There &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; more of them!

02:18:17.310 --> 02:18:19.370
LIAM: But you guys don't know that yet.

02:18:19.370 --> 02:18:23.575
MATT: You guys don't know that yet, just him.
Ending your turn, Vax. That guy on the ground is

02:18:23.575 --> 02:18:30.686
going to try and break free. That is a 17. DC 20?

02:18:30.686 --> 02:18:31.880
TALIESIN: DC 20.

02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:37.734
MATT: It struggles on the ground and can't seem to
break free of the current magic manacles that hold

02:18:37.734 --> 02:18:39.089
it in place.

02:18:39.089 --> 02:18:45.347
TALIESIN: Yeah, he's stuck. I love that we have
floors!

02:18:45.347 --> 02:18:52.273
MATT: Another one of these darts through the
window, leaps across the way, right in front of

02:18:52.273 --> 02:18:57.902
Sprigg, and you being right there, Scanlan, goes,
(angry hissing) and lashes out at you.

02:18:57.902 --> 02:18:59.516
MARISHA: He's going for Sprigg!

02:18:59.516 --> 02:19:01.827
TALIESIN: He's going for Scanlan.

02:19:01.827 --> 02:19:04.367
MARISHA: But because Scanlan's over Sprigg!

02:19:04.367 --> 02:19:05.712
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fair.

02:19:05.712 --> 02:19:09.369
MATT: Makes two claw strikes at you. First one is
16 to hit.

02:19:09.369 --> 02:19:10.373
SAM: Yes.

02:19:10.373 --> 02:19:15.527
MATT: All right. You suffer eight points of
slashing damage, and I need you make a

02:19:15.527 --> 02:19:17.255
constitution saving throw.

02:19:17.255 --> 02:19:23.014
SAM: Oh boy. Not great. 16.

02:19:23.014 --> 02:19:24.968
MATT: 16, okay.

02:19:24.968 --> 02:19:26.477
SAM: Is it magical?

02:19:26.477 --> 02:19:32.310
MATT: No, it is not magical, but you feel this
pulse of some sort of necrotic disease hit your

02:19:32.310 --> 02:19:35.254
system, and you just manage to shrug it off.

02:19:35.254 --> 02:19:37.897
(relieved cheering)

02:19:37.897 --> 02:19:41.907
MATT: The other claw comes towards you.
That's a natural 20.

02:19:41.907 --> 02:19:44.478
SAM: Natural 20 to hit, sure.

02:19:44.478 --> 02:19:53.166
MATT: That is 30 points of slashing damage on the
second hit. Make another saving throw, please.

02:19:53.166 --> 02:19:59.864
SAM: That's 17.

02:19:59.864 --> 02:20:05.085
MATT: 17. The second strike hits you and you feel
as the side of your torso gets torn out of the

02:20:05.085 --> 02:20:09.023
side, the blood splatters onto Sprigg, who's already
bloodied and now there's gnome blood on gnome

02:20:09.023 --> 02:20:13.117
blood. As you reach for your side, however, it
does not take effect; you manage to shrug off.

02:20:13.117 --> 02:20:19.059
TRAVIS: Those are constitution saving throws?

02:20:19.059 --> 02:20:24.730
MATT: Yeah. That ends the shadow ghast's turn.
Sprigg, I need you to make a death saving throw,

02:20:24.730 --> 02:20:26.530
please. Roll a d20.

02:20:26.530 --> 02:20:29.468
LIAM and MARISHA: Come on, Sprigg!

02:20:29.468 --> 02:20:30.999
DARIN: 14.

02:20:30.999 --> 02:20:34.706
MATT: Okay, so you're okay for now. You're
stabilizing. You're not bleeding out, yet. Mark a

02:20:34.706 --> 02:20:37.584
success on your death saving throws there.
Scanlan, what are you doing?

02:20:37.584 --> 02:20:42.743
SAM: I am going to, bonus action-- down here,
success, one.

02:20:42.743 --> 02:20:45.498
MATT: Actually, before he even does that, what are
you doing on your turn?

02:20:45.498 --> 02:20:47.258
SAM: I'm going to heal him first.

02:20:47.258 --> 02:20:51.000
MATT: That roll wouldn't matter because he may heal
you before you come up. Don't worry about it.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:56.690
SAM: I'll bonus action Healing Word him,
2nd-level. I will sing to him. I'll do a little

02:20:56.690 --> 02:21:03.761
line dance right in front of him and I'll say:
(singing) I'll heal your heart, your achy breaky

02:21:03.761 --> 02:21:13.190
heart. I just don't think you'll understand. That
if I heal your heart, your achy breaky heart, you

02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:16.109
got to wake up and kill a man!

02:21:16.109 --> 02:21:18.664
ALL: Ooh!

02:21:18.664 --> 02:21:21.491
DARIN: (singing) If only you had used Mage Hand!

02:21:21.491 --> 02:21:23.513
SAM: Nice!

02:21:23.513 --> 02:21:26.199
MATT: So how much does he heal?

02:21:26.199 --> 02:21:30.507
SAM: Seven plus six. 13.

02:21:30.507 --> 02:21:34.565
MATT: You heal 13 hit points. That roll doesn't
matter. You hear this echoing song in the back of

02:21:34.565 --> 02:21:40.175
your head. The second song today you've heard from
your childhood. You come to consciousness. You

02:21:40.175 --> 02:21:45.378
wake up and look around you and you can see him
singing to you as this giant horrible necrotic

02:21:45.378 --> 02:21:50.330
creature is looming right in front of you. You
have metal bolts sticking out of your chest and an

02:21:50.330 --> 02:21:55.723
old sensation you haven't felt in a long time
courses through your body, which is the need to

02:21:55.723 --> 02:21:57.206
survive.

02:21:57.206 --> 02:21:59.296
SAM: It's my turn still.

02:21:59.296 --> 02:22:01.166
MATT: It's both of your turns at the same time.

02:22:01.166 --> 02:22:03.861
SAM: I will hold my turn.

02:22:03.861 --> 02:22:05.796
MATT: What are you going to do?

02:22:05.796 --> 02:22:13.798
SAM: Dimension Door, but I'm holding until either
Pike or Keyleth heals him more. And I will also

02:22:13.798 --> 02:22:17.465
say to him, old man, do you have some fight left
in you?

02:22:17.465 --> 02:22:19.580
DARIN: I hope so.

02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:22.178
SAM: Hold that thought for one second.

02:22:22.178 --> 02:22:23.540
DARIN: Holding.

02:22:23.540 --> 02:22:25.105
MATT: So what are you doing?

02:22:25.105 --> 02:22:27.834
DARIN: There's a bookcase, is there not?

02:22:27.834 --> 02:22:31.184
MATT: There's bookcases here, bookcase there.
There's books strewn and clustered in these

02:22:31.184 --> 02:22:32.173
corners.

02:22:32.173 --> 02:22:35.653
DARIN: I'd like to, if I could, use the Ring of
Telekinesis to pull a bookcase down upon an

02:22:35.653 --> 02:22:36.763
attacker.

02:22:36.763 --> 02:22:42.056
MATT: Okay. Currently there's a bunch of books up
here on a shelf, you can pull them down on him if

02:22:42.056 --> 02:22:43.027
you'd like.

02:22:43.027 --> 02:22:44.398
DARIN: I would like to do that.

02:22:44.398 --> 02:22:48.296
MATT: So from the ground, you yank a bunch of
heavy tomes off of this large shelf that goes

02:22:48.296 --> 02:22:52.596
flying towards this creature. I'm going to make
this a dexterity saving throw for it.

02:22:52.596 --> 02:22:56.910
MARISHA: The pen is mightier than the bookcase
security!

02:22:56.910 --> 02:22:59.953
MATT: What's the DC on the telekinesis ring?

02:22:59.953 --> 02:23:03.493
DARIN: Where was it? Ring of Telekinesis.

02:23:03.493 --> 02:23:11.727
MATT: I'll pull it up here real fast. Looking up
magical items really fast. I have it here. Oh,

02:23:11.727 --> 02:23:14.750
it's for the spell Telekinesis? That's right.
What's your spell DC?

02:23:14.750 --> 02:23:18.355
DARIN: 17.

02:23:18.355 --> 02:23:22.973
MATT: 17. No, that's a failure. So for this, go
ahead and roll 3d6.

02:23:22.973 --> 02:23:25.233
SAM: He failed, or the guy failed?

02:23:25.233 --> 02:23:28.703
MATT: The guy failed. He didn't dodge out of the
way. He's like, (confused snarling, book impacts)

02:23:28.703 --> 02:23:33.121
and gets pummeled from behind by a bunch of tomes,
books, and random glass baubles that were on the

02:23:33.121 --> 02:23:35.408
shelf that shatter against the back of its head.

02:23:35.408 --> 02:23:39.323
DARIN: We have a six, we have a five, and we have
a two. 13.

02:23:39.323 --> 02:23:41.117
MATT: Then add your intelligence modifier.

02:23:41.117 --> 02:23:43.270
DARIN: My intelligence modifier is a four.

02:23:43.270 --> 02:23:51.486
MATT: 17, nice! 17 points of damage to that one.
As you slam it in the back of the head (impacts)

02:23:51.486 --> 02:24:00.524
and it doubles over and (snarling), its long
tongue slashing around. You're still on the ground,

02:24:00.524 --> 02:24:03.340
and it's over you. Is there anything else you want
to do on your turn?

02:24:03.340 --> 02:24:04.743
DARIN: Demistrik?!

02:24:04.743 --> 02:24:06.529
MATT: You hear nothing.

02:24:06.529 --> 02:24:09.607
TALIESIN: Not cool.

02:24:09.607 --> 02:24:12.301
DARIN: Can I cast something?

02:24:12.301 --> 02:24:17.076
MATT: That is an action to do that, so if you have
a bonus action spell, you could do that.

02:24:17.076 --> 02:24:19.798
DARIN: I believe I do. Tasha's Hideous Laughter?

02:24:19.798 --> 02:24:22.479
MATT: I believe that's an action to cast,
unfortunately.

02:24:22.479 --> 02:24:29.174
DARIN: I don't think we have any bonus actions.
Oh, are there any healing potions that I can use

02:24:29.174 --> 02:24:32.382
my Telekinesis to get a healing potion to me?

02:24:32.529 --> 02:24:38.925
MATT: You can do that next round. The attack was
your one action. You can stand on your feet, if

02:24:38.925 --> 02:24:39.987
you'd like to.

02:24:39.987 --> 02:24:42.434
DARIN: No, I'm gonna stay right here.

02:24:42.484 --> 02:24:46.298
MATT: Got it. That ends your turn. Now, these guys
go again.

02:24:46.298 --> 02:24:52.052
LAURA: That's good, they're at disadvantage, now,
to hit you. They are! Because you're prone.

02:24:52.052 --> 02:24:59.227
MATT: This guy's going to move in. This guy is
still standing and is going to drop the crossbow

02:24:59.227 --> 02:25:07.887
and pull out his shortsword. Is going to go ahead
and attack you, Grog, first. That is 13?

02:25:07.887 --> 02:25:09.413
TRAVIS: Misses.

02:25:09.413 --> 02:25:11.833
MATT: And a 27.

02:25:11.833 --> 02:25:13.473
TRAVIS: That does hit.

02:25:13.473 --> 02:25:22.601
MATT: You take five plus four, that's nine points
of slashing damage, reduced to five, yeah. Round

02:25:22.601 --> 02:25:35.306
down, so it's four. Struck twice, missed both. Both of
these guys are going to fire at-- one of them's

02:25:35.306 --> 02:25:42.668
going to fire at Sprigg on this end because it's
their goal, here. With disadvantage, that is a 16?

02:25:42.668 --> 02:25:44.060
What's your AC again?

02:25:44.060 --> 02:25:45.528
DARIN: My AC is 19.

02:25:45.528 --> 02:25:50.639
MATT: 19, yeah. It darts over you. It misses, it
hits the side of the wall. The other guy's going

02:25:50.639 --> 02:25:59.046
to strike again with disadvantage. That's a 14.
And you see the other guy pulling back with a

02:25:59.046 --> 02:26:03.182
crossbow and fire. You roll out of the way and it
(arrow vibrating) into the wooden flooring right

02:26:03.228 --> 02:26:04.399
next to you.

02:26:04.399 --> 02:26:07.018
DARIN: Are there any traps that they hit?

02:26:07.018 --> 02:26:16.764
MATT: No. That one is going to attack you, Vax,
because you're right there in front of it. That's

02:26:16.764 --> 02:26:23.914
going to be a 13. Does not hit. Second strike,
another 13. Both of its shortsword attacks, you

02:26:23.914 --> 02:26:33.479
duck out of the way and dodge, moving around very
quickly. All righty. Those two right there, one of

02:26:33.479 --> 02:26:37.868
them is going to, because it saw that you got up,
Scanlan, they're going to fire two bolts directly

02:26:37.868 --> 02:26:42.222
at you. That is a 16 to hit?

02:26:42.222 --> 02:26:43.606
SAM: That hits.

02:26:43.606 --> 02:26:46.024
MATT: Okay, and the second one is a 24.

02:26:46.024 --> 02:26:47.355
SAM: Everything hits.

02:26:47.355 --> 02:26:53.407
MATT: You are currently in base-to-base with one
of their companions, so they both get sneak attack

02:26:53.407 --> 02:27:12.901
on you. 19 points of piercing damage from the
first hit. 24 points of piercing damage from the

02:27:12.901 --> 02:27:18.381
second hit. And then they both duck around the
side here.

02:27:18.381 --> 02:27:22.612
SAM: What was the second one? 24.

02:27:22.612 --> 02:27:27.378
MATT: They both, we'll say, they vanish from
sight. You're not quite sure where they are right

02:27:27.378 --> 02:27:37.381
now. Those two also duck out of sight, not quite
sure where they are, either. That ends their go.

02:27:37.381 --> 02:27:43.956
Now, the guy in the back right there, who noticed
Vax show up, is going to, after you slaughter one

02:27:43.956 --> 02:27:51.094
of the guys, and stab the other one, is going to
angrily go ahead and use Blight on you. Can you

02:27:51.094 --> 02:27:55.891
go ahead an make a constitution saving throw,
please?

02:27:55.891 --> 02:28:01.554
LIAM: Natural 20. You fucking dick, necro guy!

02:28:01.554 --> 02:28:05.188
MATT: All righty. That does half the damage.

02:28:05.188 --> 02:28:11.066
LIAM: It's still a lot.

02:28:11.066 --> 02:28:13.372
TALIESIN: I feel like a natural 20 should
auto-fail this.

02:28:13.372 --> 02:28:15.388
LAURA: I know, right?

02:28:15.388 --> 02:28:18.930
MATT: 21 points of necrotic damage to you.

02:28:18.930 --> 02:28:20.420
LIAM: All righty.

02:28:20.420 --> 02:28:31.603
MATT: And is going to-- four, five, six. All
righty. That ends his turn. Vex, you're up.

02:28:31.603 --> 02:28:37.769
LAURA: I'm going to run over to the window that
those guys disappeared from.

02:28:37.769 --> 02:28:39.866
MATT: Over this way or this way?

02:28:39.866 --> 02:28:45.959
LAURA: Right there, yeah. Can I see that
motherfucker? Did I see him run past the window?

02:28:45.959 --> 02:28:49.649
MATT: You know what? Yes, because he was not
stealthing. You watch as he darts by, and you

02:28:49.649 --> 02:28:51.135
would have a shot, yeah.

02:28:51.135 --> 02:28:54.985
LAURA: All right, then I'm going to shoot at him.
I'm going to Hunter's Mark him!

02:28:54.985 --> 02:28:57.320
MATT: All righty, look at that!

02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:03.419
LAURA: Trinket doesn't have enough movement to get
over by him, does he?

02:29:03.419 --> 02:29:06.968
MATT: No, but Trinket can attack whatever's in
your area, too.

02:29:06.968 --> 02:29:21.310
LAURA: I'm going to attack him with my Bramble
Shot. With the Blazing Bowstring. Ooh, yeah.

02:29:21.310 --> 02:29:22.695
That's a 31.

02:29:22.695 --> 02:29:25.055
MATT: 31? That hits!

02:29:25.055 --> 02:29:30.304
LAURA: Yes! Okay! Do I get sneak attack on him? I
don't, do I?

02:29:30.304 --> 02:29:31.842
MATT: No.

02:29:31.842 --> 02:29:35.885
LAURA: Damn! At least I got Hunter's Mark. Okay.

02:29:35.885 --> 02:29:43.338
LIAM: Hey Matt, I realized. I never shot out the
wings, so I shouldn't have had as much movement as

02:29:43.338 --> 02:29:46.761
I did, so I think we should take the damage back
from my last attack.

02:29:46.761 --> 02:29:56.335
MATT: (counting). 50 to get up to the top there,
so at your double speed, you'd be at 60, threw the

02:29:56.335 --> 02:29:59.121
dagger and threw the dagger. You're fine. It still
works out.

02:29:59.121 --> 02:30:08.250
LAURA: Okay, 28 plus my 4d8 piercing damage.
That's balls.

02:30:08.250 --> 02:30:10.320
MATT: You're on deck, Keyleth, just so you know.

02:30:10.320 --> 02:30:16.238
LAURA: Seven, nine, plus nine is 37. 37 points of
damage.

02:30:16.238 --> 02:30:21.092
MATT: The first arrow hits him in the stomach,
doubles forward and pulls back. Now, glancing

02:30:21.092 --> 02:30:25.147
over, saw you rush up and couldn't get out in time
and now is going to try and back up as you're

02:30:25.147 --> 02:30:26.490
taking the second shot.

02:30:26.490 --> 02:30:29.869
LAURA: Does he roll a DC of over 17? A strength
save?

02:30:29.869 --> 02:30:39.026
MATT: Rolls a natural 17. Literally. Strength
save? Minus one strength modifier.

02:30:39.026 --> 02:30:43.317
(cheering)

02:30:43.317 --> 02:30:51.633
MATT: Oh, silly necromancer. You and your
strength of nine. All right, so he is currently

02:30:51.633 --> 02:31:00.748
entangled in the brambles as the vines wrap
around and pull him in, almost near the tree. You

02:31:00.748 --> 02:31:03.248
see the staff is pulled close to his chest.

02:31:03.248 --> 02:31:07.795
LAURA: Nice. Then I am going to shoot him. Oh,
wait! I didn't add my Blazing Bowstring damage.

02:31:07.795 --> 02:31:16.825
Eight more for the Blazing Bowstring. And then I'm
going to shoot him again. I'm just asking: do you

02:31:16.825 --> 02:31:19.111
get sneak attack damage if they're restrained?

02:31:19.111 --> 02:31:26.318
MATT: You do, yeah. You can do that. You have
advantage on the attack, remember, because he's

02:31:26.318 --> 02:31:27.604
restrained.

02:31:27.604 --> 02:31:33.385
LAURA: That's okay. Eight plus 14 is what? 32?

02:31:33.385 --> 02:31:34.940
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

02:31:34.940 --> 02:31:54.515
LAURA: Oh gosh! Okay! Ten, 11, 12, 13, plus sneak
attack. 13. What's that? Ten. So 23. And then

02:31:54.515 --> 02:31:59.068
Hunter's Mark. Plus one. 24.

02:31:59.068 --> 02:32:05.554
MATT: 24. Nice. The second arrow hits right in the
throat, and you can see it doesn't hit anything

02:32:05.554 --> 02:32:10.076
vital, but you can see blood's starting to pour
out. It's one of those things that if he were to

02:32:10.076 --> 02:32:12.931
pull it out, it would probably be very bad. But
he's leaving it in right now. He's looking pretty

02:32:12.931 --> 02:32:13.925
rough.

02:32:13.925 --> 02:32:15.054
TRAVIS: The necromancer is?

02:32:15.054 --> 02:32:18.477
MATT: Yeah. All righty. That ends your turn?
Keyleth, your turn.

02:32:18.477 --> 02:32:20.158
LAURA: I'm going to step away from the window.

02:32:20.158 --> 02:32:21.604
MATT: Okay. Step away from the window.

02:32:21.604 --> 02:32:23.370
LAURA: No, against the wall.

02:32:23.370 --> 02:32:27.257
MATT: Against the wall there? You push the table
back a bit; book almost falls off the top. What's

02:32:27.257 --> 02:32:28.585
Trinket doing?

02:32:28.585 --> 02:32:35.224
LAURA: Trinket is going to run over to Sprigg and
Scanlan.

02:32:35.224 --> 02:32:38.433
MATT: Up to Scanlan, or the guy who's there?

02:32:38.433 --> 02:32:39.912
LAURA: Just to the guy.

02:32:39.912 --> 02:32:41.063
MATT: Okay.

02:32:41.063 --> 02:32:44.795
LAURA: Just try to growl at him and scare him
because he can't attack him.

02:32:44.795 --> 02:32:48.637
TALIESIN: He's technically now engaged with the
bear, so if he walks away, the bear gets an attack

02:32:48.637 --> 02:32:49.562
of opportunity.

02:32:49.562 --> 02:32:54.340
MATT: That's true. That ends your turn. Trinket
goes (roars) right in front of the creature.

02:32:54.340 --> 02:32:55.634
Keyleth, what are you doing?

02:32:55.634 --> 02:33:01.638
MARISHA: Okay. In my weird, emotional panic,
Keyleth is going to turn and look around and she

02:33:01.638 --> 02:33:07.580
sees Vex firing a bow and Sprigg down on the
floor, and she's upset, and she's just going to

02:33:07.580 --> 02:33:16.148
scream at the top of her lungs and do a Fire Storm
around the building. Just (screams) and then I'm

02:33:16.148 --> 02:33:20.728
going to go (boof) where I think people might be
in my rage.

02:33:20.728 --> 02:33:25.587
MATT: Okay! So around the building where?

02:33:25.587 --> 02:33:31.420
MARISHA: Around the building. Sorry, Vax. I don't
really know you're there, but around here and around

02:33:31.420 --> 02:33:39.708
here, and I'm sure I see Vex shooting at things,
right? I'm going to try and go around.

02:33:39.708 --> 02:33:41.468
MATT: So you have right here.

02:33:41.468 --> 02:33:43.982
MARISHA: Here, around, and that way.

02:33:43.982 --> 02:33:48.958
MATT: All right. Okay, because you didn't see Vax
outside.

02:33:48.958 --> 02:33:51.235
MARISHA: No. He's getting hit.

02:33:51.235 --> 02:33:52.847
MATT: You saw Vax run upstairs.

02:33:52.847 --> 02:33:58.549
MARISHA: I just know there were people shooting through
this window and through this window, so I'm doing

02:33:58.549 --> 02:34:01.233
a perimeter around.

02:34:01.335 --> 02:34:06.261
MATT: How many squares is it? Ten,
right?

02:34:06.261 --> 02:34:10.607
MARISHA: Ten ten-by-tens.

02:34:10.607 --> 02:34:15.672
MATT: These two here get caught in it, as well as
Vax and that guy there.

02:34:15.672 --> 02:34:17.568
LAURA: What about the magician guy?

02:34:17.568 --> 02:34:20.264
MATT: If she's doing a perimeter? No.

02:34:20.264 --> 02:34:22.451
LAURA: Did you know that I was shooting at somebody?

02:34:22.451 --> 02:34:29.024
MATT: She doesn't see the magician. Doesn't know
where it is. "The Magician." The Prestige!

02:34:29.024 --> 02:34:31.439
LIAM: I have evasion.

02:34:31.439 --> 02:34:33.168
MATT: Which means it's either half or nothing.

02:34:33.168 --> 02:34:36.457
LIAM: Right. At advantage because of the boots.
What do I have to match?

02:34:36.457 --> 02:34:38.977
MATT: Her DC, which is 21, right?

02:34:38.977 --> 02:34:40.381
MARISHA: 21.

02:34:40.381 --> 02:34:42.759
MATT: Dexterity saving throw.

02:34:42.759 --> 02:34:45.202
LIAM: Oh yeah, way higher than that. We're good.

02:34:45.202 --> 02:34:48.474
MATT: Yeah, you take no damage. You duck out of
the Fire Storm just in time for it to

02:34:48.474 --> 02:34:50.081
(raging fire).

02:34:50.081 --> 02:34:52.033
MARISHA: I need two more d10s.

02:34:52.033 --> 02:34:54.716
LIAM: Yeah, dexterity save, man. Area effect.

02:34:54.716 --> 02:35:02.475
TALIESIN: Smoky d10 and spiky d10. And you get
rerolls!

02:35:02.475 --> 02:35:18.992
MARISHA: I reroll ones. None of these are ones,
unfortunately. (counting)

02:35:18.992 --> 02:35:21.897
DARIN: I just noticed the little lanterns glowing.
Bravo!

02:35:22.043 --> 02:35:25.360
MATT: Oh! Bravo to Dwarven Forge, man.

02:35:25.360 --> 02:35:27.747
SAM: Well, it's your house.

02:35:27.747 --> 02:35:30.213
MATT: True. Good torches you have in there.

02:35:30.213 --> 02:35:34.703
TRAVIS: Way to be energy-conscious with those
LEDs!

02:35:34.703 --> 02:35:40.583
MARISHA: 39 fire damage.

02:35:40.583 --> 02:35:49.327
MATT: 39 damage. This guy incinerates. He screams
and burns. He manages to dodge partway out, but

02:35:49.327 --> 02:35:54.313
even the partial damage burns him and he
(screams). You see him run off into the forest ten

02:35:54.313 --> 02:35:59.773
or so steps, on fire, like a stun man shot in a
movie before he (impact) on the ground and

02:35:59.773 --> 02:36:04.831
smolders there in the distance. Those guys take
it. What was the amount again?

02:36:04.831 --> 02:36:07.086
MARISHA: 39, and they're on fire.

02:36:07.086 --> 02:36:09.860
TALIESIN: It's hard to stealth when you're on
fire.

02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:12.219
MATT: They're both on fire.

02:36:12.219 --> 02:36:19.471
MARISHA: So that was my action. I'm going to do
that out of my staff as I slam it down. I'm going

02:36:19.471 --> 02:36:28.977
to look at Sprigg and say: gods damn it, Sprigg!
And I'm going to use that as my Healing Word, and

02:36:28.977 --> 02:36:54.327
I'm going to cast Healing Word at second level. Which
is 2d4. 11 points to you. And then I'm going to

02:36:54.327 --> 02:36:59.027
use my free action that I have to turn into a fire
elemental.

02:36:59.027 --> 02:37:01.529
MATT: Your free action?

02:37:01.529 --> 02:37:08.359
MARISHA: Changing into something's not a bonus,
it's a free action to change into my beast shape.

02:37:08.359 --> 02:37:10.754
Circle of the Moon, bitch!

02:37:10.754 --> 02:37:13.057
SAM: Did you just call your fiancé--

02:37:13.057 --> 02:37:14.687
TRAVIS: -- a bitch?

02:37:14.687 --> 02:37:20.154
MARISHA: No! Combat wild shape.

02:37:20.154 --> 02:37:25.315
MATT: Combat Wild Shape makes it a bonus action, as
opposed to an action. That's the difference.

02:37:25.353 --> 02:37:31.587
LIAM: I would like to retract my "bitch," please.

02:37:31.587 --> 02:37:37.742
MARISHA: All right, so I'm just Keyleth.

02:37:37.742 --> 02:37:47.130
MATT: Does that end your turn? All right, so as
Keyleth's turn ends, it comes to Pike's. The

02:37:47.130 --> 02:37:52.069
entire exterior perimeter of this part of the
house is on fire. Flames are now starting to

02:37:52.069 --> 02:37:57.254
catch. It is dry wood; the entire building is made
from wood of the forest, so your home is now in

02:37:57.254 --> 02:37:58.379
flames.

02:37:58.379 --> 02:38:06.880
MARISHA: Wait, hang on. No, I'm doing the
perimeter. I did think about this, which is why I

02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:09.745
didn't attack the guy in the house.

02:38:09.745 --> 02:38:14.618
TRAVIS: If you napalm the forest, the trees will
probably catch fire.

02:38:14.618 --> 02:38:16.807
LIAM: It's a quick jump, though.

02:38:16.807 --> 02:38:23.684
MATT: In order to do the perimeter, it's not a
blazing inferno, but it's starting to catch.

02:38:23.684 --> 02:38:26.456
Flames are starting to lick up the sides.

02:38:26.456 --> 02:38:28.581
LIAM: End it quick, we can save it.

02:38:28.581 --> 02:38:31.374
MATT: Fire Storm's a dangerous spell.

02:38:31.374 --> 02:38:34.544
LAURA: Let's try to save those books before they
all burn.

02:38:34.544 --> 02:38:38.476
SAM: He's an old guy. We were either going to kill
him or burn his house down.

02:38:38.476 --> 02:38:41.399
MATT: It's Vox Machina's MO, man!

02:38:41.399 --> 02:38:44.461
SAM: It was always going to end this way.

02:38:44.461 --> 02:38:48.973
TALIESIN: Things you own end up owning you.

02:38:48.973 --> 02:38:52.842
DARIN: So glad I wore a jacket.

02:38:52.842 --> 02:39:00.064
MATT: Pike is going to rush forward and is also
going to attempt to Healing Word you at level two.

02:39:00.064 --> 02:39:06.549
It's a heal fountain on you. That is six plus
five. That's 11 hit points you heal.

02:39:06.549 --> 02:39:11.327
SAM: As soon as she does that, I grab him and we
Dimension Door out the house.

02:39:11.327 --> 02:39:12.962
MATT: Where do you Dimension Door?

02:39:12.962 --> 02:39:19.392
SAM: To the only place I know: front of the house.
Outside the front door. Not right outside, but

02:39:19.392 --> 02:39:23.713
towards the edge of the map there.

02:39:23.713 --> 02:39:25.096
MATT: Over here?

02:39:25.096 --> 02:39:28.453
SAM: Yeah, anywhere around there, on approach to
the house.

02:39:28.453 --> 02:39:31.020
TRAVIS: Or do you want to be more over yonder?

02:39:31.020 --> 02:39:33.134
SAM: Where's the front door to the house?

02:39:33.134 --> 02:39:34.455
MARISHA: Right there.

02:39:34.455 --> 02:39:40.955
SAM: So I'd be 20 feet, the way we approached to
the house. So where you got it, if that's the way

02:39:40.955 --> 02:39:42.161
we approached.

02:39:42.161 --> 02:39:46.932
MATT: You guys approached this direction. So
you're there. Make a perception check, Scanlan.

02:39:46.932 --> 02:39:50.201
SAM: Okay. Ten.

02:39:50.201 --> 02:39:57.191
MATT: Okay. You don't see the two hidden fellows
over here. You see something large and hulking

02:39:57.191 --> 02:40:01.268
moving through the forest this direction, at a quick
glance.

02:40:01.268 --> 02:40:02.668
SAM: Is it naked?

02:40:02.668 --> 02:40:03.978
MATT: No.

02:40:03.978 --> 02:40:06.450
TALIESIN: Then we're going to be okay.

02:40:06.450 --> 02:40:11.196
MATT: You guys have pulled out of that house.
You're still on the ground and all of a sudden

02:40:11.196 --> 02:40:16.199
your body physically shifts, and you're looking up at
the trees. You glance around and you can see the

02:40:16.199 --> 02:40:22.518
back of your house, you can hear the frantic fray
going on. You see the necromancer who's currently

02:40:22.518 --> 02:40:26.727
covered in brambles and held in place. You see a
couple of guys on fire, on the side screaming on

02:40:26.727 --> 02:40:32.445
the side of the house, and your house starting to
catch fire. That's okay. Pike, on her turn, is

02:40:32.445 --> 02:40:35.136
going to--

02:40:35.136 --> 02:40:39.752
MARISHA: Keyleth has anger issues. It's fine.

02:40:39.752 --> 02:40:42.991
MATT: Because it's a single target...

02:40:42.991 --> 02:40:48.504
SAM: It's the "This is fine" meme, except it's
just Keyleth.

02:40:48.504 --> 02:40:54.659
MATT: She's going to cast a level five Guiding Bolt
because that's what Pike does. So ranged spell

02:40:54.659 --> 02:41:04.869
attack against that guy. 11 plus-- yeah, that
hits. That's a 21. So that is 8d6 radiant damage.

02:41:04.869 --> 02:41:11.199
Nice. 19.

02:41:11.199 --> 02:41:15.028
LAURA: Is she doing it to the magician?

02:41:15.028 --> 02:41:16.899
MATT: No, this guy right there, in the room.

02:41:16.899 --> 02:41:19.333
SAM: He's an illusionist, Laura.

02:41:19.333 --> 02:41:24.526
TRAVIS: Is she doing it against Copperfield? Is
David Blaine with them?

02:41:24.526 --> 02:41:31.513
MATT: So after she heals Sprigg, and Sprigg
vanishes, she grabs her holy symbol and goes,

02:41:31.513 --> 02:41:36.694
"Chill out!" and shoots this giant flashing beam
of divine energy that slams into it. You watch as

02:41:36.694 --> 02:41:42.334
a lot of its flesh burns away from the impact.
It's still standing, but it's a shining beacon.

02:41:42.334 --> 02:41:50.766
The next attack against it has advantage. And then
Pike's going to back up with you, Vex, towards the

02:41:50.766 --> 02:42:03.890
back where the bookcase is and goes, "You smell
something?" You now hear, simultaneously,

02:42:03.890 --> 02:42:14.086
(slow thudding) and watch as the side wall and the back
wall explode inward, as splinters of wood and

02:42:14.086 --> 02:42:18.255
stone (crashing) comes from this wall here--

02:42:18.255 --> 02:42:20.222
LAURA: Oh no, all of his stuff!

02:42:20.222 --> 02:42:22.645
MARISHA: So I didn't destroy your house &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt;.

02:42:22.645 --> 02:42:24.717
LIAM: Flames! Flames, less of a thing.

02:42:24.717 --> 02:42:26.409
TALIESIN: On the side of the house.

02:42:26.409 --> 02:42:29.733
LIAM: Flames on the side of the house!

02:42:29.733 --> 02:42:42.065
MATT: Two familiar hulking entities come
barrelling into the chamber. Remember those giant

02:42:42.065 --> 02:42:46.088
things you saw walking through the Shadowfell that
you barely avoided with the mask?

02:42:46.088 --> 02:42:47.999
MARISHA: The censer?

02:42:47.999 --> 02:42:54.997
MATT: Who has the censer? Not on you right now.
You don't carry a fucking giant smoking censer

02:42:54.997 --> 02:42:56.019
with you!

02:42:56.019 --> 02:42:58.334
LAURA: Oh, really? I didn't realize it was that
big.

02:42:58.334 --> 02:43:00.605
TALIESIN: I think at that point, I think we put it
in the Bag of Holding.

02:43:00.605 --> 02:43:03.323
SAM: But you did make a bunch of those herbs.

02:43:03.323 --> 02:43:05.242
MARISHA: I do have the herbs.

02:43:05.242 --> 02:43:07.986
SAM: And there's a shit-ton of shit on fire right
now.

02:43:07.986 --> 02:43:15.986
MATT: They burst through. (roaring) This big yell
echoes through their metal masks. It sounds like

02:43:15.986 --> 02:43:22.130
this horrible-- imagine a giant vocal scream that's
peaking on the audio level against a tinny

02:43:22.130 --> 02:43:23.556
metallic speaker.

02:43:23.556 --> 02:43:28.737
LIAM: (Bane voice) Your punishment will be more
severe!

02:43:28.737 --> 02:43:32.829
MATT: Essentially. This one's going to go after
Keyleth. This one's going to make two swipes at

02:43:32.829 --> 02:43:40.926
Trinket because Trinket's right there. As they
barrel through, part of the roof breaks. Guys up

02:43:40.926 --> 02:43:48.554
top, Percy and Grog, you feel the ground buckle a
little bit below you and you drop about two or

02:43:48.554 --> 02:43:53.435
three inches as the building is starting to lose
its physical frame.

02:43:53.435 --> 02:43:56.855
TALIESIN: Oh god, Grog, what did Keyleth do?

02:43:56.855 --> 02:43:59.793
TRAVIS: Thanks, Keyleth. You beat me by one
second!

02:43:59.793 --> 02:44:04.976
TALIESIN: I'm well aware. It was totally worth
it.

02:44:04.976 --> 02:44:10.290
MARISHA: #thanksKeyleth.

02:44:10.290 --> 02:44:14.182
MATT: That's one's going to go ahead and do two
slam attacks against Keyleth.

02:44:14.182 --> 02:44:17.371
MARISHA: Yeah, I've earned it. Come on!

02:44:17.371 --> 02:44:19.168
MATT: That's 23 to hit.

02:44:19.168 --> 02:44:20.560
MARISHA: Yeah, that hits.

02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:25.213
MATT: And that's a 29 to hit.

02:44:25.213 --> 02:44:27.308
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:44:27.308 --> 02:44:44.908
MATT: That's 20 points of bludgeoning damage from
the first hit. And the second one is 30 points of

02:44:44.908 --> 02:44:49.692
bludgeoning damage. (two slams) And it slams you.
The second fist actually pins you up against the

02:44:49.692 --> 02:44:56.274
wall there, and you feel ribs crack inside your
chest and now-- they're both down low in this

02:44:56.274 --> 02:45:01.726
hulking mass. They're almost wider than they are
any other dimension with how they're crouched down

02:45:01.726 --> 02:45:06.010
and the thickness of their body. They're taking up
almost the entirety of the room right now.

02:45:06.010 --> 02:45:07.994
MARISHA: You said 30 points, right?

02:45:07.994 --> 02:45:09.326
MATT: Yes, for the second one.

02:45:09.326 --> 02:45:10.926
MARISHA: So I'm at 83 points.

02:45:10.926 --> 02:45:18.833
MATT: Correct. The other one's going to slam twice
into Trinket. Giant fists. That's going to be a

02:45:18.833 --> 02:45:19.943
28.

02:45:19.943 --> 02:45:21.068
LAURA: 28 hits.

02:45:21.068 --> 02:45:22.060
MATT: And a 22.

02:45:22.060 --> 02:45:23.712
LAURA: 22 hits.

02:45:23.712 --> 02:45:29.645
MATT: That is five plus six. 11 points of
bludgeoning damage to Trinket.

02:45:29.645 --> 02:45:30.620
LAURA: Halved.

02:45:30.620 --> 02:45:37.830
MATT: Halved, correct. And 22 points of
bludgeoning damage, halved.

02:45:37.830 --> 02:45:41.999
LAURA: Okay, so 11 plus six is 27 points.

02:45:41.999 --> 02:45:45.171
MATT: That ends their go. We're at the top of the
round. Percy, you're upstairs.

02:45:45.171 --> 02:45:55.216
TALIESIN: Okay, this all happened. That's awkward.
That's okay, I know where I am. I'm going to run

02:45:55.216 --> 02:45:57.877
out onto the balcony really quick.

02:45:57.877 --> 02:46:00.310
MARISHA: There's room over here.

02:46:00.310 --> 02:46:01.737
TRAVIS: That guy's still up there with us, right?

02:46:01.737 --> 02:46:06.105
TALIESIN: Yeah. I figure you're going to handle
him. Grog, take care of these two. What do I see

02:46:06.105 --> 02:46:08.501
outside on the balcony?

02:46:08.501 --> 02:46:12.832
MATT: You see, currently down below-- make a
perception check. Actually, you wouldn't even see

02:46:12.832 --> 02:46:14.325
them from your perspective.

02:46:14.325 --> 02:46:16.124
TALIESIN: I just rolled a natural 20.

02:46:16.124 --> 02:46:20.253
MATT: Right, it's blocking your vision from this
side. You do see Scanlan, you see Sprigg who is

02:46:20.253 --> 02:46:24.939
currently conscious, you see this necromancer who
is currently held with brambles, and you see two

02:46:24.939 --> 02:46:27.982
streaking flames and hear screams on this side of the
building.

02:46:27.982 --> 02:46:32.596
TALIESIN: Weird question, really quickly. Where is
that giant log trap?

02:46:32.596 --> 02:46:34.802
MATT: Right there.

02:46:34.802 --> 02:46:43.097
TALIESIN: How much swing does it have? Is it
locked all the way over here, or is it hung back

02:46:43.097 --> 02:46:44.079
there?

02:46:44.079 --> 02:46:45.583
MATT: It looks more like a drop.

02:46:45.583 --> 02:46:50.497
TALIESIN: Oh, so it's a drop on the door. Good to
know. In the meantime, I'm going to run on the

02:46:50.497 --> 02:46:57.567
exterior of the wall, like right over here, if
that makes sense. That's going to be my movement.

02:46:57.567 --> 02:47:01.598
I'm going to take some fun, happy pot shots at
these bastards.

02:47:01.598 --> 02:47:04.756
LAURA: At the necromancer?

02:47:04.756 --> 02:47:12.514
TALIESIN: At the necromancer! Let's start with
that bound necromancer. He's fun.

02:47:12.514 --> 02:47:14.054
LIAM: With the Vecna eye.

02:47:14.054 --> 02:47:16.747
TALIESIN: With the Vecna eye. He's bound, so I
have advantage to hit him?

02:47:16.747 --> 02:47:18.305
MATT: Yes, you do.

02:47:18.305 --> 02:47:21.845
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to use my Animus
gun so I still have a hand open, and I'm also

02:47:21.845 --> 02:47:31.316
going to burn a point of grit so that I can get
him to drop his staff. Here we go with advantage.

02:47:31.316 --> 02:47:36.713
Oh darn, it was so close. 28.

02:47:36.713 --> 02:47:38.105
MATT: That hits.

02:47:38.105 --> 02:47:52.204
TALIESIN: That's-- ooh! Fancy. 18 points of
damage, four points of psychic damage, and he has

02:47:52.204 --> 02:47:57.465
to make a strength saving throw or drops his
items.

02:47:57.465 --> 02:48:02.087
MATT: Oh, don't worry, he drops the staff, because
there's not much left of his head. When you hit

02:48:02.087 --> 02:48:06.756
the arm, the staff's clutching, but you slam it
and it hits the side of the head and causes the

02:48:06.756 --> 02:48:11.781
right side of the face to explode against the
tree, the brambles still clutching as it falls

02:48:11.781 --> 02:48:15.758
limp to the ground, and they crush the body into a
small rock of flesh.

02:48:15.758 --> 02:48:17.157
TALIESIN: That'll do.

02:48:17.157 --> 02:48:20.443
MARISHA: You get a grit point back, right?

02:48:20.443 --> 02:48:23.946
LAURA: You get a grit point back, you get a grit
point back!

02:48:23.946 --> 02:48:27.740
MATT: You just barely see them; they have
three-quarters cover. But you have sharpshooter.

02:48:27.740 --> 02:48:32.540
TALIESIN: Three-quarters cover, what does that
mean in this crazy world? I'm going to burn a grit

02:48:32.540 --> 02:48:34.829
for advantage and shoot one of them.

02:48:34.829 --> 02:48:38.887
MATT: The one right furthest on the side there?

02:48:38.887 --> 02:48:46.069
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'll start there. Let's give it a
shot. I love advantage; it's so wonderful. 32. I

02:48:46.069 --> 02:48:53.959
really should have done extra damage. So that's
1d10 plus six. That hits, obviously. 32 to hit?

02:48:53.959 --> 02:49:00.198
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Goodbye, necromancer.

02:49:00.198 --> 02:49:02.821
TALIESIN: 17 points of damage plus two points of
psychic damage.

02:49:02.821 --> 02:49:04.437
MATT: How much was that, sorry?

02:49:04.437 --> 02:49:06.508
TALIESIN: 17 points of damage plus two points of
psychic damage.

02:49:06.508 --> 02:49:13.318
MATT: Okay. All right, he's still standing.
(bullet impact, yelps) He starts looking up to see

02:49:13.359 --> 02:49:18.893
where the shot came from as the giant bullet wound
through the torso and out the back of the shoulder

02:49:18.893 --> 02:49:23.499
was clean through. You hear him breathing, gasping
for breath. (gasping)

02:49:23.499 --> 02:49:26.519
TALIESIN: I'm going to take another shot at him.
I'm going to make this a sharpshooter shot, and

02:49:26.519 --> 02:49:41.440
again with advantage because that's fun. Here we
go. Damn! Almost a crit. That's 29. That hits.

02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:43.945
MATT: That hits, yeah. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:49:43.945 --> 02:49:53.666
TALIESIN: 14 points of damage-- I'm sorry, 24
points of damage plus two points of psychic

02:49:53.666 --> 02:49:54.812
damage.

02:49:54.812 --> 02:49:58.892
MATT: He falls to the ground, face first. The
second shot hits him in the chest. He just goes

02:49:58.892 --> 02:50:01.719
down, crumples. His body begins to smolder.

02:50:01.719 --> 02:50:07.626
TALIESIN: I use my bonus action to reload and
stare at the nice person below me.

02:50:07.626 --> 02:50:14.427
MATT: That ends Percival's turn. Grog, you're up.
You hear, downstairs, the (heavy thudding).

02:50:14.427 --> 02:50:18.342
There's the guy in front of you who's like, (angry
breathing). What are you going to do?

02:50:18.342 --> 02:50:21.896
TRAVIS: Can I smash my Titanstone Knuckles
together and cast Enlarge on myself?

02:50:21.896 --> 02:50:27.786
MATT: You can! And your head goes into the roof!
(thudding)

02:50:27.786 --> 02:50:30.205
MARISHA: We're real sorry about your house.

02:50:30.205 --> 02:50:34.000
DARIN: It wasn't a house. It was a prison.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:38.325
LAURA: Well, then you're welcome.

02:50:38.325 --> 02:50:42.107
TRAVIS: I'm hoping the floor gives.

02:50:42.107 --> 02:50:48.333
MATT: The floor gives out. As your head (crashing)
into the ceiling (creaking, crashing) it falls out

02:50:48.333 --> 02:50:56.968
from under you. You come falling down on top of
this guy. Rubble falls around. Keyleth, I need you

02:50:56.968 --> 02:51:02.557
to make a dexterity saving throw. I need Trinket
to make a dexterity saving throw. The other shadow

02:51:02.557 --> 02:51:04.723
ghast fails.

02:51:04.723 --> 02:51:08.109
MARISHA: Nine.

02:51:08.109 --> 02:51:09.408
LAURA: 14.

02:51:09.408 --> 02:51:18.079
MATT: Trinket, you, and the shadow ghast all take
22 points of bludgeoning damage as the roof caves

02:51:18.079 --> 02:51:23.327
in over on top. Large part of the upper floor now
falls and this guy stumbles and is now prone

02:51:23.327 --> 02:51:27.162
there. He also takes damage. You take 22
points of bludgeoning damage from falling through

02:51:27.162 --> 02:51:29.725
the wreckage. Trinket's is halved, yes.

02:51:29.725 --> 02:51:36.512
MARISHA: Ugh, debris, ugh!

02:51:36.512 --> 02:51:40.444
MATT: That kills him. The shadow ghast right
here.

02:51:40.444 --> 02:51:43.362
TRAVIS: Because he had barely any left.

02:51:43.362 --> 02:51:49.688
MATT: Yeah. He's like, "Huh?" (crashing) Gets
rained on with rubble, broken, splintered wood and

02:51:49.688 --> 02:51:50.646
stone.

02:51:50.646 --> 02:51:52.560
TRAVIS: The guy in Manners, he fell too, right?

02:51:52.560 --> 02:51:57.573
MATT: His part of the ceiling didn't fully
collapse. He's just out of the way. He's dangling

02:51:57.573 --> 02:52:04.093
off the edge right now, as he shakes, it's making
its way towards the hole. The whole ceiling didn't

02:52:04.093 --> 02:52:06.016
collapse, just the area right below.

02:52:06.016 --> 02:52:13.091
TRAVIS: Beautiful. Can I take Tweedledee to my
right and make two reckless attacks against him?

02:52:13.091 --> 02:52:14.911
They're not giants, right?

02:52:14.911 --> 02:52:19.197
MATT: No, they're not giants. They're considered
undead.

02:52:19.197 --> 02:52:27.477
TRAVIS: They're considered undead. 30 to hit. And
the second one.

02:52:27.477 --> 02:52:29.043
MATT: Big targets.

02:52:29.043 --> 02:52:33.048
TRAVIS: 29.

02:52:33.048 --> 02:52:34.606
MATT: Hits.

02:52:34.606 --> 02:52:44.614
TRAVIS: So ten. 24 points. Plus the Enlarge-- 25.

02:52:44.614 --> 02:52:47.985
MATT: 25 with the first hit. (whack)

02:52:47.985 --> 02:52:52.142
TRAVIS: 22 with the second one.

02:52:52.142 --> 02:52:57.340
MATT: 22 damage on the second hit. (whacks) You're
hitting him. Laying on its back, it has these

02:52:57.340 --> 02:53:02.967
metal spikes jamming out of its flesh. You can see
portions of other creatures that it had slain that

02:53:02.967 --> 02:53:07.688
have been jammed on these spikes and rotted away
on its armor. So as you're hitting it, you're

02:53:07.688 --> 02:53:11.667
knocking away parts of partially decomposed
creatures that previously fell in battle to one of

02:53:11.667 --> 02:53:16.265
these creatures. As you're slamming into it, you
can see it's just rippling, partially decayed

02:53:16.265 --> 02:53:21.058
muscle that seems to be unnaturally strengthened
by whatever necrotic energy keeps it stitched

02:53:21.058 --> 02:53:24.127
together and alive. It's a thick sack of hit
points.

02:53:24.127 --> 02:53:27.087
TRAVIS: Wow. Cool. Good to know.

02:53:27.087 --> 02:53:28.677
MATT: Is that your turn; are you doing anything
else?

02:53:28.677 --> 02:53:36.798
TRAVIS: That's interesting. I'm going to go into a
frenzied rage as my bonus action.

02:53:36.798 --> 02:53:44.198
MATT: Okay, and that's the end of your turn? Okay.
End of Grog's turn. Vax, you're up. You heard all

02:53:44.198 --> 02:53:46.736
this go on and now the whole building is starting
to catch fire.

02:53:46.736 --> 02:53:48.485
LIAM: I'm going to bolt to that window.

02:53:48.485 --> 02:53:50.339
MATT: Right there?

02:53:50.339 --> 02:53:54.644
LIAM: No, other way. So I have a view of Keyleth,
the creature, and Grog. I'm going to throw

02:53:54.644 --> 02:53:59.192
Whisper-- I've got sharpshooter-- at that thing,
and bamf there.

02:53:59.192 --> 02:54:02.784
MATT: I will say, at proximity to the flames that
are starting to catch, you do take three

02:54:02.784 --> 02:54:03.905
points of fire damage.

02:54:03.964 --> 02:54:05.075
LIAM: Fine.

02:54:05.075 --> 02:54:08.123
MATT: You threw the dagger at the big guy?

02:54:08.123 --> 02:54:11.637
LIAM: Whisper goes to the window at that guy
there.

02:54:11.637 --> 02:54:13.285
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack.

02:54:13.285 --> 02:54:15.772
LIAM: And it's flanking, right? Because of where
Grog is, or Keyleth?

02:54:15.772 --> 02:54:18.417
MATT: It's not flanking, but you get to add
sneak attack modifier.

02:54:18.417 --> 02:54:21.498
LIAM: Okay. Yeah, that's fine. That's 32.

02:54:21.498 --> 02:54:25.160
MATT: Yeah, that hits. So you appear next to it.

02:54:25.160 --> 02:54:46.031
LIAM: Three plus psychic damage is four plus this
junk. (counting) 33, doubled to 66 plus psychic

02:54:46.031 --> 02:54:50.221
damage is 74. Bamf there.

02:54:50.221 --> 02:54:55.833
MATT: And you appear next to it. As the dagger
sinks into its torso, you watch as its chest

02:54:55.833 --> 02:55:00.735
muscles and the iron cage-like armor around it
seems to swallow the dagger. As it goes inside,

02:55:00.735 --> 02:55:04.678
you watch as some of the muscles all of a sudden
(squelch) fall off of its body, like whatever

02:55:04.678 --> 02:55:09.495
energy's holding it together is untethered and
this weird, fleshy, stitched-together creature is

02:55:09.495 --> 02:55:12.001
starting to fall apart. It's looking pretty hurt.

02:55:12.001 --> 02:55:15.984
LIAM: Okay, so here's what I wanted to do. So
movement-- and I have action-action, action,

02:55:15.984 --> 02:55:18.077
action-- action-action, action, bonus action.

02:55:18.077 --> 02:55:19.946
TRAVIS, LAURA, and MARISHA: (repeating) Action,
action--

02:55:19.946 --> 02:55:22.539
LIAM: Guys, it's the rules in the book! You can
bust my balls all you want--

02:55:22.539 --> 02:55:24.769
MATT: Well, that's your first attack, so you have
your second attack.

02:55:24.769 --> 02:55:26.844
LIAM: So action-action for my regular attack,
right?

02:55:26.844 --> 02:55:28.052
MATT: Attack-attack!

02:55:28.052 --> 02:55:35.042
LIAM: It's just semantics. Attack-attack, hasted
action, bonus action. So that was the first of my

02:55:35.042 --> 02:55:36.954
attack-attacks. And here's the second one.

02:55:36.954 --> 02:55:38.615
MATT: Okay.

02:55:38.615 --> 02:55:40.130
LIAM: 30.

02:55:40.130 --> 02:55:44.963
MATT: Well, we have dagger, dagger, dagger. Now we
have attack, attack, attack, attack, attack,

02:55:44.963 --> 02:55:46.748
attack as our next t-shirt.

02:55:46.748 --> 02:55:49.222
(laughter)

02:55:49.222 --> 02:55:59.526
LIAM: I'm dumping a level two Smite into this,
against an undead. That's seven, 10, 11. Ooh, it's

02:55:59.526 --> 02:56:05.381
cocked. 17 for that hit.

02:56:05.381 --> 02:56:07.773
MATT: 17 with the additional--?

02:56:07.773 --> 02:56:09.520
LIAM: With attack-attack.

02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:12.780
MATT: Right. Well, but you said you dumped Divine
Smite into that?

02:56:12.780 --> 02:56:13.911
LIAM: Into that one.

02:56:13.911 --> 02:56:16.979
MATT: You did the additional damage for it being
undead? Okay, so that was how much total?

02:56:16.979 --> 02:56:18.250
LIAM: Whatever I just said. It was like 16.

02:56:18.250 --> 02:56:19.286
TRAVIS: 17.

02:56:19.286 --> 02:56:26.315
MATT: 17. 17 will do it, actually. So as you rush
in with the second dagger, you jam up into the

02:56:26.315 --> 02:56:30.908
same space where it's falling apart, and you hear
this dull (shockwave sound) on the inside as the

02:56:30.908 --> 02:56:37.030
divine energy radiates from the strike and its
body (slurping) sloughs off of the bones and

02:56:37.030 --> 02:56:44.459
around your arm. It slowly falls around your arm
like old gelatin and (slurping) slips into the

02:56:44.459 --> 02:56:46.636
ground, covering the floor around you.

02:56:46.636 --> 02:56:52.349
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to do the old crouch. Not
that she needs it, but crouch in front of Keyleth.

02:56:52.349 --> 02:56:58.539
And then I have my hasted action for an attack and
bonus action for an attack into the other one.

02:56:58.539 --> 02:57:10.986
29, and the second one is higher than 29. I'm
going to dump Smite into it. Three-- you're making

02:57:10.986 --> 02:57:12.904
me mess up the math, Laura!

02:57:12.904 --> 02:57:15.659
LAURA: Psychic damage.

02:57:15.659 --> 02:57:19.397
LIAM: (laughing) I can't keep track of the math!

02:57:19.397 --> 02:57:23.184
MATT: (singing) Epic-level DND!

02:57:23.184 --> 02:57:35.612
LIAM: 25 on that towards that guy, with Smite
added. And then the last dagger, with Smite, at

02:57:35.612 --> 02:57:42.796
level one, is two plus is 10, 14, 19.

02:57:42.796 --> 02:57:44.128
MATT: 19, okay.

02:57:44.128 --> 02:57:46.155
LIAM: I dumped a ton of Smite into that.

02:57:46.155 --> 02:57:49.560
MATT: You didn't add your modifier to the third
strike, right?

02:57:49.560 --> 02:57:57.356
LIAM: I don't know, so why don't you just minus
six? 19, so we'll call it 13. Some people might

02:57:57.356 --> 02:58:00.389
have been catcalling me while I was trying to do
math.

02:58:00.389 --> 02:58:06.019
MATT: That's okay. No worries. You hit with the
two final strikes. They blast into it. You watch

02:58:06.019 --> 02:58:10.768
as some of the armor gets thrown off its body. It
takes a little hit, but the other creature looks

02:58:10.768 --> 02:58:13.852
like it's largely all right. That finishes Vax's
turn.

02:58:13.852 --> 02:58:17.129
LIAM: Let me enjoy my last two months of life!

02:58:17.129 --> 02:58:21.753
MATT: Shadow ghast. What's the DC on the sphere
again?

02:58:21.753 --> 02:58:23.414
SAM: 20.

02:58:23.414 --> 02:58:28.787
MATT: Is it 20? 19. He can't escape from this
freaking sphere. The shadow ghast is up on the

02:58:28.787 --> 02:58:37.030
second floor going (growling). Manners, man. All
right. Scanlan and Sprigg, what do you guys want

02:58:37.030 --> 02:58:38.209
to do?

02:58:38.209 --> 02:58:43.088
DARIN: I have a question. The gentleman who had an
arrow in his throat: he's gone, right? He's been

02:58:43.088 --> 02:58:44.299
blown apart.

02:58:44.299 --> 02:58:45.987
MATT: Yeah. Actually, make a perception check.

02:58:45.987 --> 02:58:47.352
DARIN: Okay. That's a d20, isn't it?

02:58:47.352 --> 02:58:48.943
MATT: Yep, d20 and then add your perception
modifier.

02:58:48.943 --> 02:58:52.755
DARIN: Got it. That's a 17.

02:58:52.755 --> 02:58:58.403
MATT: A 17, okay. You glance over and you see two
guys who are hiding amongst the bushes on the side

02:58:58.403 --> 02:58:59.490
there.

02:58:59.490 --> 02:59:08.856
DARIN: Now, it's too far away to cast a spell.

02:59:08.856 --> 02:59:12.049
MATT: No, depending on the spell's range,
depending on what you want to do.

02:59:12.049 --> 02:59:13.763
DARIN: Tasha's Hideous Laughter.

02:59:13.763 --> 02:59:15.425
MATT: That we can do.

02:59:15.425 --> 02:59:17.332
MARISHA: That's such a good spell.

02:59:17.332 --> 02:59:27.781
MATT: It's a fun one. So bringing up Tasha's here,
looking at the range. There we go. It's a 30-feet

02:59:27.781 --> 02:59:29.891
range, so you want to get up and get a little
closer, probably.

02:59:29.891 --> 02:59:31.409
DARIN: I will do that, if I could.

02:59:31.409 --> 02:59:38.023
MATT: All right, so that's half your movement, and
you can move two more spaces. You can hit one guy.

02:59:38.023 --> 02:59:41.349
So one guy of these two you can select.

02:59:41.500 --> 02:59:42.647
DARIN: The first one.

02:59:42.647 --> 02:59:44.076
MATT: That one there? All righty.

02:59:44.076 --> 02:59:48.911
DARIN: Yes. I think his name is Dave? Roll a
perception?

02:59:48.911 --> 03:00:00.457
MATT: Make a saving throw, a wisdom save. That is
a ten! Your spell DC is a 17. You watch as the

03:00:00.457 --> 03:00:04.845
guy there who has his crossbow out and sees you
get up, spins around, has this giant, heavy

03:00:04.845 --> 03:00:10.259
crossbow, the bolt very recognizable because you
still have three of them in your body. Aims it

03:00:10.259 --> 03:00:16.821
towards you and then suddenly (maniacal laughter)
and drops the crossbow to the ground and doubles

03:00:16.821 --> 03:00:21.089
over laughing, falling to the ground and is now
kicking and laughing like a hyena right now,

03:00:21.089 --> 03:00:23.013
unable to do anything.

03:00:23.013 --> 03:00:24.821
DARIN: Knock knock!

03:00:24.821 --> 03:00:27.748
MATT: (maniacal laughter)

03:00:27.748 --> 03:00:28.857
DARIN: Right!

03:00:28.857 --> 03:00:31.714
(laughter)

03:00:31.714 --> 03:00:34.702
MATT: All right, is that your turn?

03:00:34.702 --> 03:00:35.682
DARIN: Yes, it is.

03:00:35.682 --> 03:00:36.704
MATT: All right.

03:00:36.704 --> 03:00:41.489
SAM: There's another guy over there? Have I seen
him yet?

03:00:41.489 --> 03:00:46.431
MATT: You haven't, actually. You do see this guy's
on fire right now, who is still around.

03:00:46.431 --> 03:00:47.827
SAM: Oh, I see somebody.

03:00:47.827 --> 03:00:50.468
MATT: Yeah, and you can see that hulking figure
come running through, and you hear the (explosion)

03:00:50.468 --> 03:00:51.940
through the back of the building.

03:00:51.940 --> 03:00:57.688
SAM: For the beginning of the round, I'll say,
guys, I think large giants are coming. Be aware.

03:00:57.688 --> 03:01:00.349
LAURA and TRAVIS: (screaming)

03:01:00.349 --> 03:01:03.075
SAM: What? I can't hear you! Speak clearly!

03:01:03.075 --> 03:01:04.943
LIAM: Threepio! Where could he be?!

03:01:04.943 --> 03:01:17.899
SAM: Okay. Shit. I'll approach the guy I can see
burning, on fire. That's where the front door is,

03:01:17.899 --> 03:01:20.185
right? Is he in front of the front door?

03:01:20.185 --> 03:01:23.097
MATT: The log is right up in this area.

03:01:23.097 --> 03:01:34.090
SAM: Oh yeah. That. So I'll take out my Wand of
Magic Missiles, and I will just take down

03:01:34.090 --> 03:01:35.361
the rope.

03:01:35.361 --> 03:01:41.302
MATT: Okay. You watch as three missiles fire out
of the wand and slam into the bits of rope up top.

03:01:41.367 --> 03:01:47.491
As they explode, it's enough of an impact to cause
it, as opposed to fall straight down, just spin

03:01:47.491 --> 03:01:52.596
and fall. I'm going to go ahead and roll a dice to
see which direction it's going to land from its

03:01:52.596 --> 03:02:01.714
front point. So we'll say inward would be one,
two, three, four, five, six. That's a six. So it

03:02:01.714 --> 03:02:07.387
plummets down, hits the ceiling, scrapes off and
slams down onto him. He's going to try and make a

03:02:07.387 --> 03:02:16.670
dexterity saving throw. That is a seven plus four,
nope. That's an 11. Go ahead and roll 4d8 please.

03:02:16.670 --> 03:02:18.646
LAURA: 4d8?

03:02:18.646 --> 03:02:22.193
DARIN: Is this Dr. Comedy, who's writhing in
laughter?

03:02:22.193 --> 03:02:26.059
MATT: I think so. Oh. No, sorry, he's over here.
This guy's on fire from her earlier.

03:02:26.059 --> 03:02:33.885
SAM: Oh, that's a five. 16.

03:02:33.885 --> 03:02:37.746
MATT: 16 points of damage to him.

03:02:37.746 --> 03:02:39.577
SAM: That's not a lot.

03:02:39.577 --> 03:02:41.798
LAURA: You only got 16 on 4d8?

03:02:41.798 --> 03:02:47.214
MATT: It's not enough to kill him, but it slams on
him and then falls over. You see as both of his

03:02:47.214 --> 03:02:52.150
flaming hands on the ground going, (groans). He's
currently restrained underneath it right there,

03:02:52.150 --> 03:02:53.643
and on fire.

03:02:53.643 --> 03:02:55.839
DARIN: Knock knock.

03:02:55.839 --> 03:02:58.693
(laughter)

03:02:58.693 --> 03:03:00.617
MATT: All right, you going to stay where you are?

03:03:00.617 --> 03:03:03.585
SAM: No. I'm going to move towards any entrance or
window I see. I can't really see over there.

03:03:03.585 --> 03:03:07.543
MATT: There's a window here, window here. This one
has flames in front of it. This one's available.

03:03:07.543 --> 03:03:19.166
SAM: I'll go towards that [no audio] other one.

03:03:19.166 --> 03:03:23.245
MATT: Okay. Four, five. That's as far as you can
move there. You see the guy on the ground who's

03:03:23.245 --> 03:03:24.847
laughing in front of you.

03:03:24.847 --> 03:03:30.961
SAM: Yeah, no thanks to him. And for a bonus, I
guess I will inspire Darin De Paul, or rather,

03:03:30.961 --> 03:03:32.657
Sprigg.

03:03:32.657 --> 03:03:34.589
LIAM: Why not both?

03:03:34.589 --> 03:03:44.173
SAM: I will sing to him, (singing) You had a bad
day, you gettin' knocked down. I sing you a song

03:03:44.173 --> 03:03:52.551
just to turn it around! You say you don't know,
but please don't die. I'll sing you this song and

03:03:52.551 --> 03:03:57.863
maybe you'll go for a ride. You had a bad day.
(speaking) I don't know how that song goes.

03:03:57.863 --> 03:04:02.902
MATT: All righty, so you get an inspiration die.
You get a d12 that you can use on any sort of

03:04:02.902 --> 03:04:06.451
skill. You don't have to use it right now, but
whenever you use a skill check or an ability check

03:04:06.451 --> 03:04:09.550
you can add that to it if you want to. There you
go.

03:04:09.550 --> 03:04:12.600
DARIN: Thank you. You know, I had a bad day.

03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:14.411
SAM: (singing) You had a bad day.

03:04:14.411 --> 03:04:18.008
(groaning and laughing)

03:04:18.008 --> 03:04:22.312
MATT: All right, so now it's the assassin's turn.
Keyleth, how much fire damage does it do when

03:04:22.312 --> 03:04:23.776
they're on fire? Is it d10?

03:04:23.776 --> 03:04:34.723
MARISHA: (stuttering) Oh jeez. Fire Storm. Yeah,
no. d10.

03:04:34.723 --> 03:04:38.387
MATT: Thought so. All right, he takes eight fire
damage.

03:04:38.387 --> 03:04:40.695
TALIESIN: Yay! Under a log.

03:04:40.695 --> 03:04:49.373
MATT: Under a log. He's going to try and break
free from restraint. Nope, that is a 14. He cannot

03:04:49.373 --> 03:04:53.974
move that giant tree that's currently crushing him
on the ground. He tries to reach out for his

03:04:53.974 --> 03:04:59.517
crossbow and aim it out towards Sprigg with one
hand because it's still loaded. But he has super

03:04:59.517 --> 03:05:01.149
disadvantage on this strike.

03:05:01.149 --> 03:05:03.285
SAM: Super disadvantage. Is that in the book?

03:05:03.285 --> 03:05:05.020
MATT: It is now.

03:05:05.020 --> 03:05:09.387
LAURA: That's in the new campaign guide. Super
disadvantage. Only when you're stuck under a tree

03:05:09.387 --> 03:05:10.648
on fire.

03:05:10.648 --> 03:05:19.427
MATT: Sure, I'll do all three. All right. Eight, 12,
12. I made him roll super disadvantage. What does

03:05:19.427 --> 03:05:24.403
this remind me of? Like a terrible old sci-fi
movie where the bad guy's on the ground with the

03:05:24.403 --> 03:05:28.403
gun trying to aim it at the hero with his final
shot and the hero just walks up and steps on the

03:05:28.403 --> 03:05:33.526
gun. You (whoosh) sidestep the bolt as it fires.
Nothing on you.

03:05:33.526 --> 03:05:34.518
DARIN: Of course.

03:05:34.518 --> 03:05:36.762
MATT: The crossbow drops, (grunting).

03:05:36.762 --> 03:05:39.070
DARIN: Knock knock.

03:05:39.070 --> 03:05:45.418
MATT: (crying) On fire. All righty, that ends his
turn.

03:05:45.418 --> 03:05:47.799
DARIN: (whispering) Comedy comes in threes.

03:05:47.799 --> 03:05:54.542
MATT: This guy back here is going to go ahead and
since you're the one who has his friend writhing

03:05:54.542 --> 03:05:58.916
on the ground, is going to go ahead and try to
shoot you with his crossbow. You do see him,

03:05:58.916 --> 03:06:05.820
although he's unaware of that, so he thinks it's a
sneak attack shot. That is a 14.

03:06:05.820 --> 03:06:07.431
TALIESIN: You got to get better cultists, man.

03:06:07.431 --> 03:06:12.068
MATT: I know, seriously. They come in large
numbers, so yeah. This one just (impact sound)

03:06:12.068 --> 03:06:14.116
hits the tree to your left. His aim's off.

03:06:14.116 --> 03:06:16.411
TRAVIS: He's missing an eye. His depth perception
sucks.

03:06:16.411 --> 03:06:21.900
MATT: Exactly. And he goes ahead and darts behind
this building there, vanishing.

03:06:21.900 --> 03:06:24.687
SAM: Did I see the bolt or any indication that he
exists?

03:06:24.687 --> 03:06:26.937
MATT: You do. He reveals himself when he fires. So
you watched him come out of the bushes and

03:06:26.937 --> 03:06:30.531
(whoosh) fire and then duck around the side of the
building. The guy on the ground is going to try

03:06:30.531 --> 03:06:35.163
and save against your spell. That is a 13 plus
zero. Nope. He's still laughing. He's just on the

03:06:35.163 --> 03:06:37.932
ground, (laughing). Tears in his eyes now.

03:06:37.932 --> 03:06:40.890
TALIESIN: I love that spell.

03:06:40.890 --> 03:06:44.851
MATT: That's the end of the assassins' turn.
Necro's dead. Vex, you're up.

03:06:44.851 --> 03:06:53.003
LAURA: I'm going to Hunter's Mark the big undead
monster in the room. And then I'm going to shoot

03:06:53.003 --> 03:06:55.632
him! With the Blazing Bowstring!

03:06:55.632 --> 03:06:58.373
TALIESIN: Be careful. You might catch the building
on fire.

03:06:58.373 --> 03:07:01.974
LAURA: Oh, but I'm going to use the sharpshooter
thing.

03:07:01.974 --> 03:07:04.651
MATT: Take minus five and do additional damage?
Okay.

03:07:04.651 --> 03:07:09.016
LAURA: Which I don't know if I should have done
that on this particular one. It was 17 to hit.

03:07:09.016 --> 03:07:11.764
MATT: 17 is exactly his armor class.

03:07:11.764 --> 03:07:14.543
LIAM: Yas, Pelor queen!

03:07:14.543 --> 03:07:16.963
(laughter)

03:07:16.963 --> 03:07:37.402
LAURA: Five plus eight is 13. Plus sneak attack,
because he's got Trinket next to him. 13, 18, 23,

03:07:37.402 --> 03:07:50.045
sorry! 23 and then lightning damage. 24. 25, 26.
And then Blazing Bowstring. God dang! 27.

03:07:50.045 --> 03:07:53.393
MATT: Okay, 27. So that's your first strike.
(arrow shot) First one just (impact sound) hits in

03:07:53.393 --> 03:07:57.946
the side and you see the bolt of energy arc out
and the flames burn up the arrow. By the way, the

03:07:57.946 --> 03:08:00.578
wall behind you is starting to get really warm.

03:08:00.578 --> 03:08:09.256
LAURA: I'm going to move forward. I'm going to
actually move toward the corner where Keyleth is.

03:08:09.256 --> 03:08:12.153
MATT: There's a guy on the ground there.

03:08:12.153 --> 03:08:13.372
LAURA: Oh, there is?

03:08:13.372 --> 03:08:14.818
MATT: Yeah. So you've got to step over him.

03:08:14.818 --> 03:08:16.217
LAURA: I'm going to step on him.

03:08:16.217 --> 03:08:22.806
MATT: As you move past, he does get a swing with
his shortsword at you. Oh, wow. That's a 25.

03:08:22.806 --> 03:08:24.959
LAURA: Oh, wow. He hits me. Probably because I
stepped on him.

03:08:24.959 --> 03:08:30.565
MATT: I think so. So you take nine points of
slashing damage. Just like, (pain sound) as you're

03:08:30.565 --> 03:08:31.959
walking past.

03:08:31.959 --> 03:08:38.985
LAURA: (pain sound) Fuck. Ah, shit. Okay, I'm
going to hit the big hulking thing again.

03:08:38.985 --> 03:08:41.318
MATT: I realized he had disadvantage, but I rolled
another 18, so it's fine.

03:08:41.318 --> 03:08:47.739
LAURA: Oh, okay, well, yeah. I'm going to do the
same thing with the big hulking guy.

03:08:47.739 --> 03:08:48.884
MATT: Okay.

03:08:48.884 --> 03:08:53.025
LAURA: 25 to hit.

03:08:53.025 --> 03:08:54.281
MATT: 25 hits.

03:08:54.281 --> 03:08:57.325
LAURA: Oh, I didn't add plus ten to the previous
one!

03:08:57.325 --> 03:09:03.398
MATT: Because of the sharpshooter, all right. 39
last time. So go ahead and take a swing at it.

03:09:03.398 --> 03:09:06.817
LAURA: Thanks! 14.

03:09:06.817 --> 03:09:09.356
MATT: You're up next, Keyleth.

03:09:09.356 --> 03:09:11.422
LAURA: 14 plus six is 20.

03:09:11.422 --> 03:09:16.716
SAM: Figure out how you're going to ruin Darin's
life more.

03:09:16.716 --> 03:09:23.076
MARISHA: I know. That's my one goal in life. I'm a
big old homewrecker.

03:09:23.076 --> 03:09:26.214
LAURA: I think that's just 32 because I don't get
sneak attack again.

03:09:26.214 --> 03:09:32.108
MATT: All right. So the second arrow slams into
him. It's still holding firm. It's taking the hits

03:09:32.108 --> 03:09:38.015
and you see parts of its body are starting to
spill black liquid out of the wounds and (growls)

03:09:38.015 --> 03:09:43.297
its red eyes still beaming out from behind the
metal mask in front of its face. Its arm swings

03:09:43.297 --> 03:09:48.671
back and tears some of the ceiling beams out with
it. It's looking pretty rickety right now. So that

03:09:48.671 --> 03:09:49.719
ends your turn?

03:09:49.719 --> 03:09:50.649
LAURA: I guess so.

03:09:50.649 --> 03:09:53.814
MARISHA: Is it in a fireproof safe? No? Okay!

03:09:53.814 --> 03:09:55.342
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

03:09:55.342 --> 03:10:02.642
MARISHA: All right. So I have this big asshole in
front of me, yeah? The house is catching on fire,

03:10:02.642 --> 03:10:13.429
right? Yeah. Nope, she'd still be really upset and
really angry. So continuing what I was saying

03:10:13.429 --> 03:10:20.541
before, she's gonna rage a little bit more and go
into her fire elemental self.

03:10:20.541 --> 03:10:21.931
MATT: Okay.

03:10:21.931 --> 03:10:26.791
MARISHA: Unable to contain her frustration--

03:10:26.791 --> 03:10:28.877
TALIESIN: This is a good plan.

03:10:28.877 --> 03:10:39.751
MATT: You technically entered the space of the guy
who's on the ground, becoming a fire elemental,

03:10:39.751 --> 03:10:42.932
which lights him on fire. (screams)

03:10:42.932 --> 03:10:50.234
MARISHA: Even more upset. I'm gonna move right in
the space of this guy.

03:10:50.234 --> 03:10:58.579
MATT: (whoosh) So occupying his space from this
side, we'll say. She can catch you guys on fire.

03:10:58.579 --> 03:11:00.120
LAURA: But she doesn't have to.

03:11:00.120 --> 03:11:01.320
MATT: I'll double-check that real fast.

03:11:01.320 --> 03:11:04.930
MARISHA: I mean, I'm magical.

03:11:04.930 --> 03:11:06.394
TALIESIN: Sparkle fire.

03:11:06.394 --> 03:11:08.219
MARISHA: I sparkle fire.

03:11:08.219 --> 03:11:09.625
LIAM: Also, we can take it.

03:11:09.625 --> 03:11:11.114
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's fire.

03:11:11.114 --> 03:11:20.109
MATT: You know what? It can move through a space
as narrow as one inch wide, so I'll say yes, you

03:11:20.109 --> 03:11:23.244
can maneuver through. Only if you want to, can you
set things on fire.

03:11:23.244 --> 03:11:29.863
MARISHA: I'm going to go into this guy's space,
engulf in flames, and do my multi-attack, two slam

03:11:29.863 --> 03:11:30.951
touch attacks.

03:11:30.951 --> 03:11:34.622
MATT: Go for it. He is now in flames.

03:11:34.622 --> 03:11:41.247
MARISHA: That's cocked. Ooh, that's good, that's
good. 21.

03:11:41.247 --> 03:11:43.089
MATT: 21, yeah.

03:11:43.089 --> 03:11:46.528
MARISHA: And 16.

03:11:46.528 --> 03:11:48.218
MATT: 16 just misses.

03:11:48.218 --> 03:11:52.438
MARISHA: Fucking balls. Okay. No, plus six to 11.
That's 17.

03:11:52.438 --> 03:11:55.342
MATT: That hits. That's what you needed.

03:11:55.342 --> 03:12:14.736
MARISHA: So both of those hit. 2d6 plus three.
First one is eight. Plus ten. 18 fire damage.

03:12:14.736 --> 03:12:25.843
MATT: He's looking pretty hurt. As you slam him
with both of your flaming hands and claw across

03:12:25.843 --> 03:12:30.641
his body, where the flame hits, you see it
(hissing) singes through the flesh and drags

03:12:30.641 --> 03:12:35.937
charred remains of where the muscle once was where you
dragged your claws through. The body's starting to

03:12:35.937 --> 03:12:39.763
shake as it's holding its form together.

03:12:39.763 --> 03:12:42.977
MARISHA: That's all I've got, I think. That's it.

03:12:42.977 --> 03:12:44.903
SAM: No. You have action, action, action, action,
action.

03:12:44.903 --> 03:12:46.682
(laughter)

03:12:46.682 --> 03:12:48.144
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Bonus action.

03:12:48.144 --> 03:12:49.872
LAURA: Hasted action.

03:12:49.872 --> 03:12:54.946
LIAM: Send all your complaints to Mike Mearls and
Chris Perkins at Wizards of the Coast.

03:12:54.946 --> 03:13:02.558
SAM: Matt, not to be a dick, but has anyone
stepped on the trap on the floor?

03:13:02.558 --> 03:13:13.054
MATT: Actually, you know what, Vax would have
avoided it. Because Vax is in the spot where it

03:13:13.054 --> 03:13:16.600
was, but Vax knew where it was, so Vax would have
probably gone over it.

03:13:16.600 --> 03:13:20.749
SAM: So cool. You're doing the little splits over
it.

03:13:20.903 --> 03:13:22.609
LIAM: Splitsing. Van Damme-ing it.

03:13:22.609 --> 03:13:25.435
MATT: Wait, you wouldn't have, because when you
threw the dagger--

03:13:25.435 --> 03:13:26.757
LIAM: Let's do it.

03:13:26.757 --> 03:13:31.176
MATT: It's not a big deal. Thank you for pointing
that out.

03:13:31.176 --> 03:13:33.449
SAM: But your boots are gone.

03:13:33.449 --> 03:13:36.322
LIAM: She stole them again? How did you do it?

03:13:36.322 --> 03:13:42.887
MATT: You guys glance upward as you hear a (deep
swoosh) and up above you in the hole in the

03:13:42.887 --> 03:13:54.694
ceiling where there once was nothing but air, you
see hovering above you a giant beholder just

03:13:54.694 --> 03:13:59.075
appear. (guttural moan) All of its eyestalks
curling around it.

03:13:59.075 --> 03:14:05.774
MARISHA: What do you mean, it's not a big deal?
That's the part that I'm confused about!

03:14:05.774 --> 03:14:12.386
MATT: Thank you for that. So that finishes your
turn, Keyleth. Pike's turn. Pike sees this--

03:14:12.386 --> 03:14:17.570
LIAM: If we're retconning that in, I'm retconning
(blows raspberry) when I see it.

03:14:17.570 --> 03:14:19.872
DARIN: Don't get Gargamel angry.

03:14:19.872 --> 03:14:27.156
MARISHA: Does that mean that Keyleth would have
seen the beholder beforehand? You know what, don't

03:14:27.156 --> 03:14:28.206
worry about it.

03:14:28.206 --> 03:14:32.621
MATT: No. You were so angry-- it's in the hole
above. You don't quite see where that hole was at

03:14:32.621 --> 03:14:34.314
the moment, you backed away.

03:14:34.314 --> 03:14:37.082
MARISHA: Man, so much blind rage.

03:14:37.082 --> 03:14:42.986
MATT: So much blind rage. Look guys, that's what
we're doing. So anyway, Pike does actually make an

03:14:42.986 --> 03:14:46.304
insight check, and says, "It's not real. Don't
worry about it!"

03:14:46.304 --> 03:14:48.561
LAURA: Thanks, Pike.

03:14:48.561 --> 03:14:50.981
MATT: Fixed.

03:14:50.981 --> 03:14:54.521
(laughter)

03:14:54.521 --> 03:14:56.379
LAURA: It's not a big deal, you guys.

03:14:56.379 --> 03:15:04.749
MATT: Pike, however, is going to go ahead and make
another Guiding Bolt at the large guy there.

03:15:04.749 --> 03:15:18.727
That's going to be a 20. That hits. That's going
to be 4d6. 14 points of radiant damage, which will

03:15:18.727 --> 03:15:25.298
do it. So you watch as Pike blasts it in the face
with the Guiding Bolt. As it hits, the mask gets

03:15:25.298 --> 03:15:33.572
thrown off, and where the head was beneath it, you
see this empty black void with two red burning

03:15:33.572 --> 03:15:38.969
coals for eyes that blink out as soon as the mask
is removed, and the whole body crumples to the

03:15:38.969 --> 03:15:42.805
ground and turns into a horrible, thick,
black-purple ichor.

03:15:42.805 --> 03:15:44.760
LAURA: I'm going to have nightmares about that.

03:15:44.760 --> 03:15:46.554
SAM: For sure.

03:15:46.554 --> 03:15:53.061
MATT: The beholder is still upstairs, staying in
place going (hoarse screaming).

03:15:53.061 --> 03:15:59.106
(laughter)

03:15:59.106 --> 03:16:01.114
MATT: Yeah, it's that kind of thing.

03:16:01.114 --> 03:16:03.025
TALIESIN: Brilliant.

03:16:03.025 --> 03:16:09.247
MATT: That ends Pike's turn. They're both dead.
That brings us back. Percival, it's your turn.

03:16:09.247 --> 03:16:12.657
There's the one guy on the ground there. One's
laughing. We'll say for the purposes of this, for

03:16:12.657 --> 03:16:18.859
the time, most everything there is not much of a
threat at this point. So systematically, the guy

03:16:18.859 --> 03:16:20.892
on the ground who's hidden by the tree, you can
just--

03:16:20.892 --> 03:16:23.966
TALIESIN: I'm ignoring him. I'm not even gonna
deal. I'm just hopping in the window. I'm going to

03:16:23.966 --> 03:16:28.119
grab my little guy there. I'm going to bring him
out to the balcony, and I'm going to

03:16:28.119 --> 03:16:30.454
unceremoniously toss him out of the house.

03:16:30.454 --> 03:16:31.904
SAM: Defenestrated!

03:16:31.904 --> 03:16:35.673
MATT: You throw him (thud). He lands.

03:16:35.673 --> 03:16:39.397
TALIESIN: And then I'm going to jump and I'm going
to crawl down the rest of my way and join him

03:16:39.397 --> 03:16:44.495
outside the house. And try and jump around the
fire, dragging him away from the fire.

03:16:44.495 --> 03:16:46.684
MATT: Make an athletics check. Sorry, acrobatics
check.

03:16:46.684 --> 03:16:52.962
TALIESIN: Acrobatics? Bless you for an acrobatics
check. I'm rerolling that.

03:16:52.962 --> 03:16:55.429
MATT: No, it's not a saving throw. You can't do
that.

03:16:55.429 --> 03:16:58.264
TALIESIN: It's not a saving throw. Oh well, that's
fine. That's a 16.

03:16:58.264 --> 03:17:00.582
MATT: I'll say for the purposes of this--

03:17:00.582 --> 03:17:02.055
TALIESIN: I had the Spider Climb boots.

03:17:02.055 --> 03:17:07.603
MATT: Right, I know. But Spider Climb boots only
helps you if you keep on the surface. So as you

03:17:07.603 --> 03:17:12.773
leap, you manage to land on your feet, but the
flames do catch you a bit, so you take six points

03:17:12.773 --> 03:17:25.118
of fire damage as you start to burn. For the
purposes of time on this one, the guy who's

03:17:25.118 --> 03:17:28.821
currently under the log just burns to death there
under the log. Pinned, he's trying to reach for

03:17:28.821 --> 03:17:33.194
his crossbow, but he's only fired the one bolt
that was loaded in it. The guy on the ground is

03:17:33.194 --> 03:17:35.379
still laughing as you approach him.

03:17:35.379 --> 03:17:37.507
DARIN: Are there any rocks about?

03:17:37.507 --> 03:17:40.079
MATT: Yeah, there's quite a few heavier rocks on
the ground.

03:17:40.079 --> 03:17:45.784
DARIN: Well, I look at him, and I say, "It was a
prison, but it was my prison." And I use the

03:17:45.784 --> 03:17:49.404
Telekinesis ring to lift a rock and drop it on his
head.

03:17:49.404 --> 03:17:54.792
MATT: (splat) A horrible sickening crack sound. It
slams into the head. You lift it up. The laughing

03:17:54.792 --> 03:18:00.429
has stopped, but he's still moving and you can see
the face is broken. The nose is smashed to the

03:18:00.429 --> 03:18:03.409
side and it's just blood. He's starting to try and
get back up.

03:18:03.409 --> 03:18:10.125
DARIN: Well, tell them that Ethred Brokenbranch
sends his regards.

03:18:10.125 --> 03:18:13.026
MATT: Do you let him get up?

03:18:13.026 --> 03:18:14.747
DARIN: Yes.

03:18:14.747 --> 03:18:17.858
MATT: He gets up. (grunting)

03:18:17.858 --> 03:18:21.146
SAM: I'll Lightning Bolt him as he runs away.

03:18:21.146 --> 03:18:29.836
MATT: Okay, we'll say for the purposes of this, he
runs off in the distance (footsteps, yelp) and

03:18:29.836 --> 03:18:31.655
falls to the ground, no longer moving.

03:18:31.655 --> 03:18:37.949
TRAVIS: Can I kill the guy on the floor? Can he be
mine, please? Can I please smash him? The guy

03:18:37.949 --> 03:18:39.684
that's lying on the floor in the house, please?

03:18:39.684 --> 03:18:41.199
TALIESIN: Just sit on him.

03:18:41.199 --> 03:18:44.688
TRAVIS: I haven't Gallaghered anybody in a while.

03:18:44.688 --> 03:18:49.349
MATT: He's on the ground on fire now, going
(frantic gasps) patting out the fire.

03:18:49.349 --> 03:18:50.775
LAURA: Oh, Grog, put him out!

03:18:50.775 --> 03:18:53.208
MATT: He spends his action putting the fire out
now, and is like, (frantic gasps).

03:18:53.208 --> 03:18:56.748
MARISHA: Keyleth takes a few steps back and
motions as a fire elemental...

03:18:56.748 --> 03:19:00.866
TRAVIS: I skip on in and (gibberish yell).

03:19:00.866 --> 03:19:08.231
MATT: He's like, (scream, impact). Just smashed on
the ground. Red watermelon.

03:19:08.231 --> 03:19:10.426
LAURA: Fire's out, I'm assuming.

03:19:10.426 --> 03:19:18.428
MARISHA: I drop my fire form, turn, see my anger,
destruction, get immediately guilty, and then do a

03:19:18.428 --> 03:19:22.885
Tidal Wave to quell the flames.

03:19:22.885 --> 03:19:34.305
MATT: The building is standing, mostly. The whole
front of it is blackened. The flames are gone.

03:19:34.305 --> 03:19:38.663
Most of the interior is destroyed. You have two
giant holes in the back. Most of the upper ceiling

03:19:38.663 --> 03:19:41.926
is ruined. The house is in shambles.

03:19:41.926 --> 03:19:44.064
LAURA: What about the books?

03:19:44.064 --> 03:19:47.305
MATT: A lot of them have been destroyed. Some of
the ones on the back wall have been burned. Some

03:19:47.305 --> 03:19:53.876
of them have been burned by people in flames or
made of flame or general black ichor that spilled

03:19:53.876 --> 03:19:56.327
out. The house is pretty wrecked.

03:19:56.327 --> 03:19:59.556
LAURA: Can I go over to them and see if I can find
some books I think Percy would like?

03:19:59.556 --> 03:20:01.297
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:20:01.297 --> 03:20:05.051
SAM: I'm running over to see that staff with an
eye in it.

03:20:05.051 --> 03:20:07.428
LAURA: 27.

03:20:07.428 --> 03:20:15.402
MATT: 27? Okay. You start glancing through. You
find some history books. You find some that relate

03:20:15.402 --> 03:20:23.005
to local history. You see some books that relate
to various types of creatures; some animals and

03:20:23.005 --> 03:20:31.641
beasts. Many that are encyclopedias of various
rivers and it's scattered everywhere. It's just

03:20:31.641 --> 03:20:38.843
universal knowledge of pretty much anything he can
get his hands on. So some of it seems less useful

03:20:38.843 --> 03:20:42.415
than others but you hand-pick a few out that you
think Percy would like.

03:20:42.415 --> 03:20:47.276
TRAVIS: I don't mean to ask the obvious question,
but how did he know we were here?

03:20:47.276 --> 03:20:51.006
TALIESIN: No, that's not an obvious question. I
have no idea.

03:20:51.006 --> 03:20:52.683
MARISHA: They have multiple eyes.

03:20:52.683 --> 03:20:57.160
LAURA: But how? Was he watching us? Is he scrying
on us?

03:20:57.160 --> 03:20:58.250
TALIESIN: Must have.

03:20:58.250 --> 03:21:00.034
LAURA: Oh, he's fucking scrying on us.

03:21:00.034 --> 03:21:03.741
TALIESIN: Maybe he can feel you the way you can
feel him.

03:21:03.741 --> 03:21:07.739
MATT: You get the sense that's not how this
works.

03:21:07.739 --> 03:21:10.873
TALIESIN: Yeah. I don't know.

03:21:10.873 --> 03:21:15.883
MARISHA: He had another eye, right?

03:21:15.883 --> 03:21:17.826
SAM: Does that thing have an eye in it?

03:21:17.826 --> 03:21:22.740
MATT: The staff you see? It's a carved eye. It's
made of wood and paint. It's ornamental. It's

03:21:22.740 --> 03:21:25.666
mainly used as a focus, technically acts as a
plus-one staff.

03:21:25.666 --> 03:21:33.242
TRAVIS: Sprigg. You said this place was a prison.
Did you mean that?

03:21:33.242 --> 03:21:38.417
DARIN: Of course I meant it, boy. I've been there
for years.

03:21:38.417 --> 03:21:41.762
TRAVIS: Could you leave? If you wanted.

03:21:41.762 --> 03:21:47.745
DARIN: Of course I can. The prison was more up
here than in there.

03:21:47.745 --> 03:21:51.970
TRAVIS: Oh. Sorry about the prison, then.

03:21:51.970 --> 03:22:00.198
DARIN: Why would you be sorry? I asked you for
power and redemption. Don't you feel you gave me

03:22:00.198 --> 03:22:05.701
that? We lived, child. We all lived.

03:22:05.701 --> 03:22:16.053
TRAVIS: Yep. Yes. That is indeed what I was hoping
for.

03:22:16.053 --> 03:22:20.729
LAURA: I lean out the window. Hey, Sprigg!

03:22:20.729 --> 03:22:22.364
DARIN: Hello!

03:22:22.364 --> 03:22:23.446
LAURA: Hi.

03:22:23.446 --> 03:22:30.830
DARIN: Hi! How are you? I have some arrows in me
at the moment. You like arrows, don't you?

03:22:30.830 --> 03:22:32.848
LAURA: I do. Come in here, I'll take them off your
hands.

03:22:32.848 --> 03:22:38.849
DARIN: Okay. Question: if you do that, I'd
probably die again.

03:22:38.849 --> 03:22:40.841
LAURA: I'll cure you, darling. Don't worry.

03:22:40.841 --> 03:22:43.151
DARIN: She called me darling.

03:22:43.151 --> 03:22:46.054
SAM: She's the cutest.

03:22:46.054 --> 03:22:51.509
DARIN: (growls) I go in.

03:22:51.509 --> 03:22:57.634
(laughter)

03:22:57.634 --> 03:23:04.041
MATT: You walk into your destroyed abode, managing
to sidestep all the bear traps along the way.

03:23:04.041 --> 03:23:07.564
You've walked the path many times and you know it
and I'm actually surprised none of you walked into

03:23:07.564 --> 03:23:15.826
any of them. You knew where most of them were, but
none of you wandered out far enough into the open

03:23:15.826 --> 03:23:23.066
to do that. They're all inside. You can see your
giant friend, of course, that you were talking to

03:23:23.066 --> 03:23:28.528
as you walked in is twice the size he was earlier.
Previously where you had to hunch, you're now

03:23:28.528 --> 03:23:31.459
having to almost belly crawl inside the house.

03:23:31.459 --> 03:23:34.762
TRAVIS: But why? There's no separation between the
first and the second floor.

03:23:34.762 --> 03:23:36.407
MATT: So if you stand in that space, you're fine.

03:23:36.407 --> 03:23:41.731
TRAVIS: I'm in my space.

03:23:41.731 --> 03:23:46.868
TALIESIN: I'm going to prop our idiot up in the
window so I can go in and keep an eye on him even

03:23:46.868 --> 03:23:48.275
while I'm inside.

03:23:48.275 --> 03:23:49.622
SAM: We have a prisoner?

03:23:49.622 --> 03:23:50.898
TALIESIN: Yeah. I kept one.

03:23:50.898 --> 03:23:53.856
LAURA: But he's one of those creepy ghouls that
probably doesn't speak.

03:23:53.856 --> 03:23:57.482
MATT: And in the last minute or so has not been
able to break free but is still trying.

03:23:57.482 --> 03:24:00.913
TALIESIN: He automatically fails until 24 hours
has elapsed.

03:24:00.913 --> 03:24:02.555
MATT: After the first failed save?

03:24:02.555 --> 03:24:08.527
TALIESIN: Any further attempts by the creature
automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed. He

03:24:08.527 --> 03:24:12.565
ain't going nowhere. It's mean, man.

03:24:12.565 --> 03:24:16.105
LAURA: Me and Pike can heal him as I take the
arrows out.

03:24:16.105 --> 03:24:17.225
MATT: Okay.

03:24:17.225 --> 03:24:20.038
DARIN: At last you've seen the &lt;i&gt;point&lt;/i&gt; of me, eh?

03:24:20.038 --> 03:24:25.312
LAURA: (sarcastic laugh) Sprigg, anything valuable
in here that you want to save before we get you

03:24:25.312 --> 03:24:26.879
out of here?

03:24:26.879 --> 03:24:29.740
DARIN: Would like my organs! Oh, I would like to
save those.

03:24:29.740 --> 03:24:31.022
LAURA: Yes.

03:24:31.022 --> 03:24:35.230
DARIN: All right. No. There's nothing.

03:24:35.230 --> 03:24:39.153
LAURA: No keys to Ioun? You know where she is?

03:24:39.153 --> 03:24:47.692
DARIN: I might. I hope I do. I hope that I can
give you the answers you seek.

03:24:47.692 --> 03:24:51.737
LAURA: I hope so, too. I cast Cure Wounds.

03:24:51.737 --> 03:24:58.270
MATT: Pike casts Cure Wounds on you, as well, and
you heal 18.

03:24:58.270 --> 03:24:59.699
DARIN: Do I know her name yet?

03:24:59.699 --> 03:25:01.353
MATT: No, you do not.

03:25:01.353 --> 03:25:02.582
DARIN: Cleric.

03:25:02.582 --> 03:25:04.433
MATT: "Pike."

03:25:04.433 --> 03:25:13.463
DARIN: Yes. Ethred. Or Sprigg. Whichever you like.
You can call me Sprigg. Can you help me pray to

03:25:13.463 --> 03:25:19.468
Ioun? We need answers, and I think together we
might find them.

03:25:19.468 --> 03:25:31.491
MATT: "I can certainly try. Do you have any items
of her iconography?"

03:25:31.491 --> 03:25:34.666
DARIN: Do I?

03:25:34.666 --> 03:25:42.449
MATT: Yeah, actually. You just reach over and find
one of the undamaged books.

03:25:42.449 --> 03:25:45.267
LAURA: You healed 19, by the way.

03:25:45.267 --> 03:25:52.179
DARIN: Thank you. Use this and you talk to her
where I can't. At least, not yet.

03:25:52.179 --> 03:25:57.690
MATT: "I don't know if I can talk to her. I'm
not... But I can help you pray. I don't know if

03:25:57.690 --> 03:25:58.831
"it'll be enough."

03:25:58.831 --> 03:26:03.402
DARIN: Let's give it a go. There's a first time
for everything.

03:26:03.402 --> 03:26:06.925
MATT: "Grog!"

03:26:06.925 --> 03:26:08.091
TRAVIS: Yeah?

03:26:08.091 --> 03:26:09.788
MATT: "Can you help me clear some of the floor,
please?"

03:26:09.788 --> 03:26:14.033
TRAVIS: Not a problem! (grunting) Keyleth, catch!

03:26:14.033 --> 03:26:15.734
MARISHA: Ah! Ow!

03:26:15.734 --> 03:26:18.282
(laughter)

03:26:18.282 --> 03:26:20.421
SAM: Floorboards! In her face!

03:26:20.421 --> 03:26:24.277
TRAVIS: I thought you were on fire. I'm really
sorry.

03:26:24.277 --> 03:26:35.264
MATT: Pike takes you over to the center of the
room and tells you. "Kneel with me. Now take this

03:26:35.264 --> 03:26:44.401
"book and close your eyes and... apologize."

03:26:44.401 --> 03:26:48.389
DARIN: For what?

03:26:48.389 --> 03:26:52.217
MATT: "For everything you said about Ioun."

03:26:52.217 --> 03:26:59.866
DARIN: (grumbles) All right. Well, look the other
way. Find some things that are of value.

03:26:59.866 --> 03:27:02.179
TRAVIS: (whistles)

03:27:02.179 --> 03:27:06.272
LAURA: Trinket sits down next to him and stares,
but I'll turn around.

03:27:06.272 --> 03:27:19.588
DARIN: All right. I don't know if you're
listening, Ioun. It's been many years since I've

03:27:19.588 --> 03:27:33.574
actually spoken to a god. I'd like to express my
deepest sorrow. You see, this home... didn't mean

03:27:33.574 --> 03:27:46.035
as much to me as life. And I think these people
gave that to me. If you could give us... If you

03:27:46.035 --> 03:27:54.830
could give me anything, any little hint, it would
be greatly appreciated and I would be a warrior in

03:27:54.830 --> 03:28:04.687
your name forevermore. Please. Was that okay,
bear?

03:28:04.687 --> 03:28:10.052
MATT: (huffs, licking) Licks the side of your
face.

03:28:10.052 --> 03:28:12.289
DARIN: No, I'm not crying. You're crying, bear.

03:28:12.289 --> 03:28:17.281
MATT: You sit there in silence with your eyes
closed, concentrating, holding the book before

03:28:17.281 --> 03:28:32.601
you. Doesn't seem to be an answer. Just silence in
the darkness. Nothing. Everyone wants to

03:28:32.601 --> 03:28:34.264
look at him-- still turned away?

03:28:34.264 --> 03:28:38.312
MARISHA: Keyleth is definitely staring, but
pretending not to stare.

03:28:38.312 --> 03:28:40.370
TALIESIN: I'm watching through the book.

03:28:40.370 --> 03:28:43.506
LAURA: I'm leaning against the wall and staring at
him now.

03:28:43.506 --> 03:28:54.957
MATT: Nothing. Nothing responds. As you have your
eyes closed, you hear this soft chuckle in the far

03:28:54.957 --> 03:28:59.650
corner of the room. (cackles) "Really? Praying,
are you?"

03:28:59.650 --> 03:29:03.477
DARIN: Yes. Can you help?

03:29:03.477 --> 03:29:07.109
MATT: "Do I look the kind of guy that would
help?"

03:29:07.109 --> 03:29:19.919
DARIN: Yes. I've known you for 19 years and I
think anybody's capable of anything, so why don't

03:29:19.919 --> 03:29:23.038
you do something unexpected?

03:29:23.038 --> 03:29:29.573
MATT: "I think you're right. It's no longer your
prison. It's not mine, either."

03:29:29.573 --> 03:29:31.164
DARIN: That's true.

03:29:31.164 --> 03:29:32.913
MATT: (flapping) Flies out the window.

03:29:32.913 --> 03:29:35.093
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

03:29:35.093 --> 03:29:40.507
DARIN: Kraghammer has another performer, and not a
very good one.

03:29:40.507 --> 03:29:46.247
MATT: While you've been talking, by the way, and
the silence has been sad. Taking in the slight

03:29:46.247 --> 03:29:50.679
emotional cut that not getting a response and
putting yourself on that limb means nothing. The

03:29:50.679 --> 03:29:53.257
rest of you notice his torso is glowing bright
blue.

03:29:53.257 --> 03:29:54.953
MARISHA: What? Is it really?

03:29:54.953 --> 03:29:56.211
MATT: Yeah.

03:29:56.211 --> 03:30:02.105
TRAVIS: Your stomach is glowing.

03:30:02.105 --> 03:30:07.206
DARIN: Growing? What? I didn't eat anything. How
could my stomach be growing?

03:30:07.206 --> 03:30:08.446
SAM: You're blue balling.

03:30:08.446 --> 03:30:10.515
DARIN: What?

03:30:10.515 --> 03:30:14.547
SAM: (whispering) Look down.

03:30:14.547 --> 03:30:22.016
MATT: Pike looks at you and takes your hands and
opens your arms and motions to your chest. And the

03:30:22.016 --> 03:30:28.828
book in your hand, you pull aside. You glance down
and you can see, there's this soft, bluish glow

03:30:28.828 --> 03:30:32.299
that's emanating from your torso. Strange.

03:30:32.299 --> 03:30:41.030
DARIN: You see? I didn't have to believe in Ioun.
I've found my religion. (chuckling) I'm Bluish!

03:30:41.030 --> 03:30:44.508
(laughter)

03:30:44.508 --> 03:30:46.295
TRAVIS: Aw, man!

03:30:46.295 --> 03:30:47.718
DARIN: It didn't happen!

03:30:47.718 --> 03:30:49.750
MATT: No, it did. That's canon.

03:30:49.750 --> 03:30:58.305
DARIN: Wait a second, gentlemen. We'll restart for
just a second. It'll be fine. That little imp is

03:30:58.305 --> 03:31:06.723
gone. So apparently, the key... is me.

03:31:06.723 --> 03:31:09.214
LAURA: Is you? It is you.

03:31:09.214 --> 03:31:11.223
SAM: Is in you or is you?

03:31:11.223 --> 03:31:16.402
MARISHA: It is him. I've known it from the minute
that I laid eyes upon him. It's him.

03:31:16.402 --> 03:31:19.755
TRAVIS: You did? You knew that the moment you saw
him?

03:31:19.755 --> 03:31:25.168
MARISHA: No, I mean I had a hunch, I had a
feeling, deep down inside. I can't say it. If I

03:31:25.168 --> 03:31:27.948
say it out loud and then if it's not true then I'm
an asshole.

03:31:27.948 --> 03:31:30.259
LIAM: To be fair, we've only been here 12
minutes.

03:31:30.259 --> 03:31:37.568
DARIN: Yes. House gone. The imp gone. Burny,
burny. Sad, sad. Pray, nothing happened. Now I'm

03:31:37.568 --> 03:31:41.105
blue. That's a day for you, isn't it?

03:31:41.105 --> 03:31:46.111
LAURA: So do you glow brighter the closer we get?
What's the deal here?

03:31:46.111 --> 03:31:48.607
DARIN: I've never glowed before, child.

03:31:48.607 --> 03:31:50.031
LAURA: I think it's glown.

03:31:50.031 --> 03:31:52.978
DARIN: I've never glowned.

03:31:52.978 --> 03:31:57.044
SAM: If you're the key, where's the lock? Where do
we take you?

03:31:57.044 --> 03:32:07.238
DARIN: Well, I have been gone for many, many years,
so English may have changed. To be fair. To be

03:32:07.238 --> 03:32:13.961
fair. I don't know. This is all new to me. I would
have thought it would be in one of those tomes.

03:32:13.961 --> 03:32:18.846
TALIESIN: I'm going to pick up the book that he
was holding when he was praying. I'm going to just

03:32:18.846 --> 03:32:20.282
try and read it.

03:32:20.282 --> 03:32:28.739
MATT: Okay. You glance through it. The book is a
simple book, talking about the construction of

03:32:28.739 --> 03:32:34.436
barricades and it looks like it was less 
the contents of the book and more just the image

03:32:34.436 --> 03:32:35.934
of the book itself.

03:32:35.934 --> 03:32:44.866
TALIESIN: I'm going to hand him the book again and
see if maybe there's focus to be found. Maybe this

03:32:44.866 --> 03:32:45.756
is--

03:32:45.756 --> 03:32:51.108
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

03:32:51.108 --> 03:33:00.202
TALIESIN: Oh, lord. Ooh. Let's call that a 28.

03:33:00.202 --> 03:33:05.550
MATT: When you took the book from him and handed
him another book, there was a very faint vibration

03:33:05.550 --> 03:33:11.287
to his body as you pulled it from him and gave it
back to him. Which you haven't noticed, but

03:33:11.287 --> 03:33:13.822
there's a physical vibration to him.

03:33:13.822 --> 03:33:17.408
TALIESIN: If it's all-- with your permission, I'm
going to take his hands.

03:33:17.408 --> 03:33:21.797
MATT: Okay. You feel them, and you feel this very
faint vibration to his body.

03:33:21.797 --> 03:33:25.257
MARISHA: Percy.

03:33:25.257 --> 03:33:26.391
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:33:26.391 --> 03:33:35.733
MARISHA: Continue holding his hands. I pull out
the Tome of Quick Movement. Hold. Hold while I

03:33:35.733 --> 03:33:37.332
find the paper. Hold.

03:33:37.332 --> 03:33:39.451
LAURA: What if he's a tuning fork?

03:33:39.451 --> 03:33:41.097
MARISHA: (shushes)

03:33:41.097 --> 03:33:42.504
DARIN: That's very rude.

03:33:42.504 --> 03:33:44.553
MARISHA: Where is it? I have a lot of things.

03:33:44.553 --> 03:33:45.743
SAM: Divining.

03:33:45.743 --> 03:33:53.458
DARIN: Oh yes. A divining rod. A rod to the
divine. Perhaps I am a divining rod.

03:33:53.458 --> 03:33:55.105
LAURA: That's what I mean.

03:33:55.105 --> 03:33:56.741
DARIN: Well said, child!

03:33:56.741 --> 03:34:02.317
MARISHA: I pull out the fork we that we got to get
to Elysium. Is it similar?

03:34:02.317 --> 03:34:10.995
MATT: When you pull out the fork and you hold it,
you recall that whenever you cast the spell Plane

03:34:10.995 --> 03:34:15.913
Shift, there was a faint vibration to the specific
fork when you cast the spell.

03:34:15.913 --> 03:34:17.700
SAM and TALIESIN: He's the tuning fork.

03:34:17.700 --> 03:34:18.951
MARISHA: Oh no.

03:34:18.951 --> 03:34:20.435
LAURA: What, no? This is good!

03:34:20.435 --> 03:34:33.532
MARISHA: No, it is good. It's good, it's just...
Oh, Sprigg. No, it's fine. It's good. I don't

03:34:33.532 --> 03:34:42.118
know. Everything in my life seems to have this
impermanence factor about it. So I hope he's not

03:34:42.118 --> 03:34:45.688
something that can be used and discarded.

03:34:45.688 --> 03:34:50.909
DARIN: I haven't been used in 37 years.

03:34:50.909 --> 03:34:52.163
MARISHA: Sprigg.

03:34:52.163 --> 03:34:57.833
DARIN: It's all right. At least I wasn't discarded
all that time.

03:34:57.833 --> 03:35:01.029
MARISHA: I'm sure it's fine, I just--

03:35:01.029 --> 03:35:13.992
DARIN: Look. Look at me. Just remember. Whatever
happens, remember me. That's all that's

03:35:13.992 --> 03:35:15.293
important.

03:35:15.293 --> 03:35:19.752
LIAM: That's good advice.

03:35:19.752 --> 03:35:29.224
DARIN: That's all that we have. My friends are
gone and I don't even remember their names. I

03:35:29.224 --> 03:35:37.358
don't remember Thetapax or Zephyr or... the guy
with the nose. He was my favorite.

03:35:37.358 --> 03:35:45.303
(coughs and sniffles) Dusty in here, isn't it?

03:35:45.303 --> 03:35:46.950
MARISHA: Oh, Sprigg.

03:35:46.950 --> 03:36:01.771
DARIN: (sniffles and coughs) I remember. (softer)
I remember. See? It's all up here. So whatever

03:36:01.771 --> 03:36:08.258
happens, keep me there. All right?

03:36:08.258 --> 03:36:19.015
MARISHA: I guess I have to start getting used to
losing things.

03:36:19.015 --> 03:36:29.160
DARIN: Yes. Or you can be hidden away in a prison
for 37 years. And that's not life, child. That's

03:36:29.160 --> 03:36:32.130
hiding. Don't hide.

03:36:32.130 --> 03:36:37.527
MARISHA: I've already built my own prison. They
don't know. I'm already there.

03:36:37.527 --> 03:36:49.276
DARIN: You can break out. You can. It's hard. But
you can do it. Just take the first step. And then

03:36:49.276 --> 03:36:52.903
you take another one. And then you take another
one.

03:36:52.903 --> 03:37:00.593
MARISHA: And I grab his hand, and with that, I
cast Plane Shift to wherever he is leading to go.

03:37:00.593 --> 03:37:03.712
MATT: All right. The rest of you gathered hands
for this?

03:37:03.712 --> 03:37:04.789
LAURA: I guess so.

03:37:04.789 --> 03:37:06.768
MATT: All right.

03:37:06.768 --> 03:37:10.842
LAURA: Is there enough of us? Trinket, in the
necklace. Quick!

03:37:10.842 --> 03:37:12.536
MATT: Trinket. (roars) Into the necklace.

03:37:12.536 --> 03:37:15.162
DARIN: Wait. My invisible frog companion.

03:37:15.162 --> 03:37:17.005
SAM: Is he real?

03:37:17.005 --> 03:37:18.848
DARIN: Yes.

03:37:18.848 --> 03:37:20.691
(laughter)

03:37:20.691 --> 03:37:27.039
MATT: There is a sudden (sucking noise). A
shuddering of power energy around you as you feel

03:37:27.039 --> 03:37:31.709
the vibration out of Sprigg's hand emanate
throughout the entire loop you guys have created

03:37:31.709 --> 03:37:37.689
throughout your grasp. The familiar bright light
flashes before you, and you feel your body being

03:37:37.689 --> 03:37:44.180
pulled through, at incredible speeds, through
darkness. There. The familiar racing of the divine

03:37:44.180 --> 03:37:55.569
gate. (fast travel noise) As you pass through one
of its many portholes. Then, adrift. By now

03:37:55.569 --> 03:37:59.342
you've-- the times you've passed through the gate,
you've passed through it a handful of times since

03:37:59.342 --> 03:38:07.480
now. Adrift. Still holding hands, but the circle's
beginning to turn into an oval. You can all glance

03:38:07.480 --> 03:38:17.266
around and see each other. Did you miss your
destination? Did you overshoot? What's next?

03:38:17.266 --> 03:38:29.990
(whoosh) Another white flash. And suddenly you're
at a destination. You glance around and you're

03:38:29.990 --> 03:38:35.844
standing within a small chamber. It resembles a
decadent bathhouse but with no water nor occupants.

03:38:35.844 --> 03:38:41.787
It's empty. There are marble pillars stretching to
a domed ceiling about 60 feet above you all.

03:38:41.787 --> 03:38:48.748
Silk-draped cloths drift and hang at odd angles
throughout the ceiling. Glowing points of magical

03:38:48.748 --> 03:38:54.327
light latched within iron cages dangle at the
edges of these pillars about 15 feet up that give

03:38:54.327 --> 03:39:00.885
the faint glow to an otherwise darkened room.
There are walls on each side of this chamber,

03:39:00.885 --> 03:39:09.384
about 30 or 40 feet from you, and one arched
hallway across from you that leads to the only

03:39:09.384 --> 03:39:11.990
other chamber you've seen.

03:39:11.990 --> 03:39:17.927
MARISHA: I immediately turn and look to see if
Sprigg is still holding my hand.

03:39:17.927 --> 03:39:20.928
MATT: Sprigg is still holding your hand.

03:39:20.928 --> 03:39:24.008
LAURA: See? All that fucking shit was for nothing!
He's still alive!

03:39:24.008 --> 03:39:28.220
SAM: Are you the same Sprigg as before?

03:39:28.220 --> 03:39:40.628
DARIN: I hope so. Let's ask my invisible frog
companion. Well, I guess we'd better go find what we

03:39:40.628 --> 03:39:45.302
are looking for.

03:39:45.302 --> 03:39:52.290
MARISHA: Okay. Glad you're with us, Sprigg.

03:39:52.290 --> 03:39:55.361
DARIN: It's good to be alive.

03:39:55.361 --> 03:39:56.969
MARISHA: Yes, it is.

03:39:56.969 --> 03:39:58.941
DARIN: Remember that.

03:39:58.941 --> 03:40:02.959
MARISHA: Okay. I will.

03:40:02.959 --> 03:40:10.750
MATT: As you guys walk forward towards the
singular hallway, you go through the domed arch,

03:40:10.750 --> 03:40:22.775
and the hallway extends on. Featureless, smooth
grey marble. Like a solid punch that seemed to

03:40:22.775 --> 03:40:29.746
have carved out whatever this material was. It
extends for 100 feet. 150 feet. And even though

03:40:29.746 --> 03:40:38.609
there's very very faint light, and many of you can
see through darkvision, there is a darkness about

03:40:38.609 --> 03:40:43.103
60 feet from you that seems to consume what you
can see. You can only see so far beyond that

03:40:43.103 --> 03:40:50.597
radius, and you're not quite sure where that
oppressive shadow is coming from. The air is

03:40:50.597 --> 03:40:57.408
chilled, but not uncomfortably so. You can hear
the distant sound of pinched winds whining through

03:40:57.408 --> 03:41:03.379
small spaces. A familiar sound from the many times
you've spent underground, through caverns that had

03:41:03.379 --> 03:41:09.376
some openings that allowed air to streak through
to the surface.

03:41:09.376 --> 03:41:24.142
A few steps more and suddenly the hallway opens
into a second chamber. Into a library, if you could

03:41:24.142 --> 03:41:32.150
even call it that. Bookshelves that stretch upward
for seemingly hundreds of feet, before flickering

03:41:32.150 --> 03:41:40.043
lights fell from your vision. You do not see where
they stop. These columns of just tomes and cases

03:41:40.043 --> 03:41:49.536
and scrolls and parchments stacking as in tablets
and any form of recorded information seem to just

03:41:49.536 --> 03:41:57.596
be infinite in front of you, to two sides of this
road and upward. They seem to stretch in almost

03:41:57.596 --> 03:42:01.142
every direction, the walls to the side of you. You
see columns ahead of you, and they tend to wind

03:42:01.142 --> 03:42:10.196
and curl like a labyrinth made of bookcases, to no
end. It's very Escher-esque in how the further up

03:42:10.196 --> 03:42:15.552
you look, they tend to curve and shift and bend
around each other.

03:42:15.552 --> 03:42:22.614
Your eyes, now attuned to the realms beyond
mortality, you catch glimpses of shifting wind

03:42:22.614 --> 03:42:29.254
gathering books and turning pages. Spirits of the
library, though sparse as they may be from this

03:42:29.254 --> 03:42:37.438
entry point, organizing. Reading and learning from
whatever words are within. You begin to almost get

03:42:37.438 --> 03:42:41.602
vertigo, trying to contemplate the strange and
overwhelming construction of such a wondrous

03:42:41.602 --> 03:42:47.721
place. An endless sea of stories. Spectral
custodians keeping the tales of each other and the

03:42:47.721 --> 03:42:54.488
history of Exandria past, present, and binding the
pages to tell what will eventually be the present,

03:42:54.488 --> 03:42:55.955
currently the future.

03:42:55.955 --> 03:43:01.207
TALIESIN: I've dreamed of this place.

03:43:01.207 --> 03:43:05.271
LIAM: Inside Matt's brain?

03:43:05.271 --> 03:43:29.398
TALIESIN: This is immortality. This is everything.
(sighs, chuckles) I may never leave. I glide over

03:43:29.398 --> 03:43:40.150
to Vex and hold her close. This is stunning. My
god, I think they may have actually forgotten all

03:43:40.150 --> 03:43:42.596
the idiot things I said yesterday.

03:43:42.596 --> 03:43:45.812
LAURA: Feels pretty good, doesn't it?

03:43:45.812 --> 03:43:51.713
TALIESIN: I think they've completely forgotten.
I'm sorry. May have panicked.

03:43:51.713 --> 03:43:53.550
LAURA: I give him a kiss.

03:43:53.550 --> 03:44:01.436
TALIESIN: I'll be right back. I'm going to run
towards one of those stacks, like a child.

03:44:01.436 --> 03:44:06.959
MATT: Okay. You begin to take the first--

03:44:06.959 --> 03:44:13.422
TALIESIN: I'm doing a title run. I want to figure
out the organizational system before I touch a

03:44:13.422 --> 03:44:14.378
book.

03:44:14.378 --> 03:44:18.167
MATT: There are no words on any of the spines.

03:44:18.167 --> 03:44:20.476
TALIESIN: I pick one.

03:44:20.476 --> 03:44:22.751
MATT: Okay. You pick.

03:44:22.751 --> 03:44:31.514
TALIESIN: All right. I pick it up. I look around
to see if anybody has a problem. And I turn to the

03:44:31.514 --> 03:44:32.961
title page.

03:44:32.961 --> 03:44:35.076
MATT: It's ironic you do this, because the book is
in Celestial.

03:44:35.076 --> 03:44:37.233
TALIESIN: I read Celestial.

03:44:37.233 --> 03:44:44.958
MATT: You do. It's ironic that you did that.
(chuckles) Glancing through, it appears to be

03:44:44.958 --> 03:44:54.374
describing a birth. Describing a tunnel, then a
light, then a cry.

03:44:54.374 --> 03:44:59.238
TALIESIN: I skip to the end. Last page.

03:44:59.238 --> 03:45:04.068
MATT: It seems to be an older man, surrounded by
his family--

03:45:04.068 --> 03:45:08.763
TALIESIN: I've got it. I put it down. I pick up
another one.

03:45:08.763 --> 03:45:11.765
MATT: You glance through this book.

03:45:11.765 --> 03:45:12.989
TALIESIN: First page.

03:45:12.989 --> 03:45:14.668
MATT: Begins very similarly to the last one.

03:45:14.668 --> 03:45:15.801
TALIESIN: Last page.

03:45:15.801 --> 03:45:20.930
MATT: This one actually ends with what appears to
be a horseback riding accident.

03:45:20.930 --> 03:45:22.457
MARISHA: Oh god, they're souls.

03:45:22.457 --> 03:45:24.021
TALIESIN: 115 pages in.

03:45:24.021 --> 03:45:31.680
MATT: 115 pages in you get to a page that seems to
talk about the sorrow of a lost romance, and

03:45:31.680 --> 03:45:34.378
trying to deal, coping at a young adult age.

03:45:34.378 --> 03:45:37.733
TALIESIN: I put it back and I turn. They're made
of people.

03:45:37.733 --> 03:45:39.973
LAURA: Wait, what? It's skin books?

03:45:39.973 --> 03:45:48.398
TALIESIN: It's people! And I'm going to find the
most interesting spine and I'm going to turn to

03:45:48.398 --> 03:45:50.744
the first. Birth. Death.

03:45:50.744 --> 03:45:52.246
LAURA: I can't read that, dear.

03:45:52.246 --> 03:46:04.549
TALIESIN: Birth! Death! Sex. Birth, death, some
disappointment. I am just gone. I'm running back

03:46:04.549 --> 03:46:08.565
and forth, finding whatever interesting spine I
can. Are they all in Celestial?

03:46:08.565 --> 03:46:11.895
MATT: They are currently. All the ones you've
picked up are in Celestial.

03:46:11.895 --> 03:46:17.887
TALIESIN: Oh my god. Okay. This is great. All
right. I'm eventually probably going to pass out

03:46:17.887 --> 03:46:20.197
from mild hyperventilation and have to sit down.

03:46:20.197 --> 03:46:25.079
LAURA: We should maybe find Ioun, don't you
think?

03:46:25.079 --> 03:46:39.918
TALIESIN: If we must, yes. Just as an experiment,
I'm going to think about Vesper and try and touch

03:46:39.918 --> 03:46:45.896
a book. I don't expect this to work, but I'm going
to close my eyes and think about, and pick it up

03:46:45.896 --> 03:46:47.639
and flip through it.

03:46:47.639 --> 03:46:56.756
MATT: Make a religion check.

03:46:56.756 --> 03:46:58.142
TALIESIN: Nope.

03:46:58.142 --> 03:47:02.699
MATT: You grab a tome and pull it forth, and as
you read through the story, it's an unfamiliar

03:47:02.699 --> 03:47:03.638
one.

03:47:03.638 --> 03:47:10.673
TALIESIN: There's a system. I will discover the
system. I'm going to keep running around like a

03:47:10.673 --> 03:47:11.926
kid.

03:47:11.926 --> 03:47:14.378
MATT: What are the rest of you guys doing while
Percival is running around like a kid?

03:47:14.378 --> 03:47:16.618
TRAVIS: I'm not interested in the fucking books.

03:47:16.618 --> 03:47:22.987
MARISHA: Distracted by Percy, Keyleth just scans.
Does anything in Primordial stick out?

03:47:22.987 --> 03:47:26.404
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:47:26.404 --> 03:47:34.812
MARISHA: That's good. 29.

03:47:34.812 --> 03:47:39.712
MATT: Glancing about, none of the spines have
anything written on them, so you have to start

03:47:39.712 --> 03:47:41.342
pulling a few books out and opening them.

03:47:41.342 --> 03:47:46.358
MARISHA: I hold my hand over and pull.

03:47:46.358 --> 03:47:51.823
MATT: You open it up. It's not in a language you
understand.

03:47:51.823 --> 03:47:55.442
MARISHA: I put it back and get frustrated.

03:47:55.442 --> 03:48:00.568
TALIESIN: I've stopped. I'm good.

03:48:00.568 --> 03:48:07.204
LIAM: Watched her the whole time and quietly walk
up behind and give her a hug from behind and don't

03:48:07.204 --> 03:48:08.712
say anything.

03:48:08.712 --> 03:48:12.279
SAM: Are there any doors leading forward or back?

03:48:12.279 --> 03:48:17.977
MATT: It's a labyrinth of bookshelves. There's a
path forward between, two or three ahead of you,

03:48:17.977 --> 03:48:23.274
but then it comes to an end where it splits off in
two directions. Like I said, they travel up

03:48:23.274 --> 03:48:26.776
infinitely, so you're not quite sure which way
leads where.

03:48:26.776 --> 03:48:28.384
LAURA: Is Sprigg still glowing?

03:48:28.384 --> 03:48:33.811
MATT: Sprigg is, actually-- There's a very faint
blue glow in him that never really faded since

03:48:33.811 --> 03:48:34.884
your arrival.

03:48:34.884 --> 03:48:39.733
LAURA: I wonder if we could follow the glow.
Warmer?

03:48:39.733 --> 03:48:42.624
MARISHA: Hey, Sprigg. Stand over there!

03:48:42.624 --> 03:48:47.758
DARIN: All right. I run to where she's pointing.
Is there any change in the glow?

03:48:47.758 --> 03:48:49.082
MATT: No noticeable change.

03:48:49.082 --> 03:48:50.784
MARISHA: Damn. Sprigg, stand over there!

03:48:50.784 --> 03:48:57.251
DARIN: I just was shot with a bunch of arrows, so
give me a second. I run over there, stop halfway

03:48:57.251 --> 03:49:02.793
and go, ow, and then I continue. When I get there,
any change in the glow?

03:49:02.793 --> 03:49:04.519
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:49:04.519 --> 03:49:08.800
DARIN: Oh, it's a one.

03:49:08.800 --> 03:49:11.735
MATT: No discernible difference.

03:49:11.735 --> 03:49:14.196
SAM: You're inspired, if you want to use
inspiration.

03:49:14.196 --> 03:49:15.974
MATT: It's a natural one. It's an auto-fail.

03:49:15.974 --> 03:49:20.564
TALIESIN: Is there a card catalog?

03:49:20.564 --> 03:49:23.807
SAM: Is there a central area info desk?

03:49:23.807 --> 03:49:28.253
MATT: You can make an investigation check to begin
to wander around and try to find your way.

03:49:28.253 --> 03:49:30.721
SAM: Oh, that's a natural 20.

03:49:30.721 --> 03:49:36.749
MATT: Scanlan seems to walk with purpose into one
of the random rows.

03:49:36.749 --> 03:49:39.329
SAM: I'm clutching my Ioun stone.

03:49:39.329 --> 03:49:45.477
MATT: Okay. All right. Anyone else do anything?

03:49:45.477 --> 03:49:49.703
TALIESIN: He seems to have purpose. I'm giddily
following behind.

03:49:49.703 --> 03:49:51.529
MATT: Okay, Percy's following Scanlan.

03:49:51.529 --> 03:49:53.640
LAURA: I'm going to walk with Percy. Oh, and
Trinket's out.

03:49:53.640 --> 03:49:58.216
MATT: Okay. Trinket (bear grunt) looks confused
and starts looking up.

03:49:58.216 --> 03:50:00.365
LAURA: I know. I know, dear.

03:50:00.365 --> 03:50:01.845
MATT: Falls onto his back.

03:50:01.845 --> 03:50:04.420
SAM: Are Vex and Percy walking with me?

03:50:04.420 --> 03:50:05.473
MATT: Yes, they are.

03:50:05.473 --> 03:50:11.224
SAM: I'm going to whip out my flute and I start
going, (wedding march).

03:50:11.224 --> 03:50:14.304
TALIESIN: Oh. He may have heard.

03:50:14.304 --> 03:50:19.049
LAURA: He heard?

03:50:19.049 --> 03:50:21.234
TALIESIN: I thought you were going to die! I may
have panicked.

03:50:21.234 --> 03:50:22.507
LAURA: Wait.

03:50:22.507 --> 03:50:27.562
TALIESIN: We were asked to plead for your life,
and I may have panicked.

03:50:27.562 --> 03:50:34.149
LAURA: Who did you tell? Percival, who did you
tell?

03:50:34.149 --> 03:50:35.699
SAM: Look at your shirt.

03:50:35.699 --> 03:50:40.692
LAURA: What? (screams) No!

03:50:40.692 --> 03:50:42.697
TALIESIN: I panicked!

03:50:42.697 --> 03:50:43.709
LAURA: Percy!

03:50:43.709 --> 03:50:49.471
TALIESIN: I panicked! There was a giant glowing
sun, and I may have panicked. Well, I was a bit

03:50:49.471 --> 03:50:50.891
vague, but I was--

03:50:50.891 --> 03:50:53.948
LAURA: A bit vague? Scanlan, what did he say?

03:50:53.948 --> 03:50:55.541
SAM: Well.

03:50:55.541 --> 03:50:56.860
TALIESIN: Oh no.

03:50:56.860 --> 03:51:01.356
SAM: First comes love. Then comes marriage.

03:51:01.356 --> 03:51:04.987
TALIESIN: I may have hinted that we might have
eloped. May have hinted.

03:51:04.987 --> 03:51:07.124
SAM: Wait, you're married?

03:51:07.124 --> 03:51:09.358
TALIESIN: I may have hinted.

03:51:09.358 --> 03:51:14.601
SAM: Wait, no, you said you were betrothed to be
married? Wait, you're married? Oh, wow, you just

03:51:14.601 --> 03:51:15.582
spilled it!

03:51:15.582 --> 03:51:17.048
TALIESIN: Silence! Cone of Silence!

03:51:17.048 --> 03:51:18.937
SAM: They're married!

03:51:18.937 --> 03:51:24.786
MATT: You try and yell, and it's making no sound.
It is just absolute quiet. What are the rest of

03:51:24.786 --> 03:51:25.893
you guys doing?

03:51:25.893 --> 03:51:28.077
DARIN: I run in the corner and see if I glow
again.

03:51:28.077 --> 03:51:32.980
LIAM: Keyleth and Vax heard the (wedding march),
so we had a very different silent scene over in

03:51:32.980 --> 03:51:34.329
our spot.

03:51:34.329 --> 03:51:40.047
MARISHA: Yeah, Keyleth was quietly sobbing in
Vax's arms and then heard (wedding march) and went

03:51:40.047 --> 03:51:41.490
(angry roar).

03:51:41.490 --> 03:51:46.680
LAURA: Why is that bad? Why was that angry?

03:51:46.680 --> 03:51:48.643
LIAM: Because we don't get that.

03:51:48.643 --> 03:51:49.917
LAURA: Oh.

03:51:49.917 --> 03:51:51.416
MATT: Grog?

03:51:51.416 --> 03:51:55.861
SAM: So you're going to ruin everyone else's joy.
You're one of those couples.

03:51:55.861 --> 03:52:02.208
LIAM: Thank you, vacation Scanlan.

03:52:02.208 --> 03:52:06.051
MARISHA: Worst double date sangria partners ever.

03:52:06.051 --> 03:52:09.882
TALIESIN: He's back, ladies and gentlemen. He's
back and taking no prisoners.

03:52:09.882 --> 03:52:13.816
SAM: Are you guys going on vacation? We got a
divorce.

03:52:13.816 --> 03:52:17.524
LIAM: It's the Debbie Downer SNL sketch.

03:52:17.524 --> 03:52:21.631
MATT: Grog, what are you doing?

03:52:21.631 --> 03:52:28.985
TRAVIS: I'm as uncomfortable as I can possibly be.
This is the worst-case scenario of my entire life.

03:52:28.985 --> 03:52:33.613
I'm not moving and hoping this is all over soon.

03:52:33.613 --> 03:52:35.685
TALIESIN: I love that.

03:52:35.685 --> 03:52:42.246
TRAVIS: It's just endless books, beyond what you
can see! Are there chairs?

03:52:42.246 --> 03:52:44.720
LAURA: I feel like Pike would've comforted him.

03:52:44.720 --> 03:52:46.109
MATT: Yeah, Pike comes over.

03:52:46.109 --> 03:52:47.185
TRAVIS: There are chairs?

03:52:47.185 --> 03:52:50.507
MATT: No, there aren't. She goes, "Do you want to
go with everyone else, Grog?"

03:52:50.507 --> 03:52:53.060
TRAVIS: I don't know. Do you?

03:52:53.060 --> 03:52:54.729
MATT: "It's okay, yeah! They're walking."

03:52:54.729 --> 03:52:57.870
TRAVIS: I want to leave. Fast.

03:52:57.870 --> 03:53:01.480
MATT: "The faster we follow them, then the faster
we can go."

03:53:01.480 --> 03:53:03.814
TRAVIS: Okay. Let's go.

03:53:03.814 --> 03:53:05.503
MATT: "I bet you could read some of these books."

03:53:05.503 --> 03:53:08.366
TRAVIS: I bet not. These are really tall books.

03:53:08.366 --> 03:53:15.096
MATT: "Come on." She grabs your hand and begins
tugging you behind her. What are you guys doing?

03:53:15.096 --> 03:53:17.170
MARISHA: Me and him?

03:53:17.170 --> 03:53:18.102
MATT: Yeah.

03:53:18.102 --> 03:53:19.747
LIAM: Leaning into each other.

03:53:19.747 --> 03:53:21.176
MATT: Okay. So you guys stay there.

03:53:21.176 --> 03:53:25.182
DARIN: I'm trying to see if I'm glowing anywhere.

03:53:25.182 --> 03:53:28.126
MATT: You run around for a good minute and a half
and you're not seeing any sort of change.

03:53:28.126 --> 03:53:28.901
DARIN: Nothing?

03:53:28.901 --> 03:53:29.827
MATT: No.

03:53:29.827 --> 03:53:35.450
DARIN: Can I go forward into the bookcases and
look right and left to see where they lead?

03:53:35.450 --> 03:53:38.401
MATT: Okay, yeah. You turn around the corner and
see them disappear around the edge.

03:53:38.401 --> 03:53:41.802
DARIN: I'll continue.

03:53:41.802 --> 03:53:47.027
MATT: Okay. So you follow them. As you guys are
having this silent argument, Sprigg catches up to

03:53:47.027 --> 03:53:51.894
you, but you hear nothing, Sprigg, as they're all
going...

03:53:51.894 --> 03:53:54.059
TALIESIN: I just turned it off. I got everyone to
agree.

03:53:54.059 --> 03:53:55.089
MATT: Okay.

03:53:55.089 --> 03:53:58.397
LAURA: Hi. How's it going?

03:53:58.397 --> 03:54:05.511
DARIN: Glowing. You are, too! What's going on with
that? Yeah, you seem to be blushing.

03:54:05.511 --> 03:54:09.203
LAURA: It's so hot in here. It's very hot in
here.

03:54:09.203 --> 03:54:12.274
MATT: Pike and Grog catch up around the corner.

03:54:12.274 --> 03:54:17.634
TRAVIS: What did you find? The way out? Exit?

03:54:17.634 --> 03:54:24.687
SAM: Seems like it could be this way. We'll have
to band together and go forward.

03:54:24.687 --> 03:54:26.764
TRAVIS: Really?

03:54:26.764 --> 03:54:27.718
SAM: Yes.

03:54:27.718 --> 03:54:29.532
TALIESIN: Where did you get the sunglasses from?

03:54:29.532 --> 03:54:31.621
SAM: It's glowing in here.

03:54:31.621 --> 03:54:35.048
MATT: The Ioun stone actually is giving a faint
glow similar to the glow that you see emanating

03:54:35.048 --> 03:54:36.499
from Sprigg's torso.

03:54:36.499 --> 03:54:38.836
SAM: Is it glowing any more than--

03:54:38.836 --> 03:54:40.160
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:54:40.160 --> 03:54:50.081
SAM: Oh, okay. That's an eight. Maybe 11, I don't
know. Do I add Jack of All Trades?

03:54:50.081 --> 03:54:51.762
MATT: You do, yeah. If you're not--

03:54:51.762 --> 03:55:03.437
SAM: I really want to know. I will inspire myself,
and I'll add a d12. That makes it 16.

03:55:03.437 --> 03:55:09.409
MATT: Okay. You start getting the sense, the
further you walk, both your stone and Sprigg are

03:55:09.409 --> 03:55:15.132
beginning to emanate a slightly stronger glow, and
so you guys begin to realize that this could be

03:55:15.132 --> 03:55:17.399
used as a path to something. You're not quite
sure.

03:55:17.399 --> 03:55:19.915
SAM: Let's keep going.

03:55:19.915 --> 03:55:21.780
MATT: Okay. So everyone's going behind.

03:55:21.780 --> 03:55:29.190
LIAM: Imagination clarification, because a Silence
effect went off there. Did Vax and Keyleth hear,

03:55:29.190 --> 03:55:32.328
"You're married?" Or was that all covered by
Silence?

03:55:32.328 --> 03:55:33.610
MATT: No, he crushed that in Silence.

03:55:33.610 --> 03:55:35.755
LIAM: So we heard the song, but that's it. Good to
know.

03:55:35.755 --> 03:55:40.725
MATT: Everyone else has gone ahead and vanished
into the library. You guys are staying?

03:55:40.725 --> 03:55:49.072
LIAM: Noticing that we're totally alone, silently
tug Keyleth down after them.

03:55:49.072 --> 03:55:51.718
TALIESIN: I felt that honesty was important at
that moment.

03:55:51.718 --> 03:55:57.130
LAURA: No, it very much is. I'm very glad. I'm
just surprised he didn't say anything. I spoke

03:55:57.130 --> 03:55:58.363
with him.

03:55:58.363 --> 03:56:02.669
SAM: He was acting nobly. I won't tell anyone if
you don't want me to.

03:56:02.669 --> 03:56:07.056
TALIESIN: We had to tell them eventually.

03:56:07.056 --> 03:56:12.715
MATT: As you're following the stone, you hear some
footfalls as Vax and Keyleth catch up to you

03:56:12.715 --> 03:56:13.783
guys.

03:56:13.783 --> 03:56:17.103
MARISHA: We already know. It's fine.

03:56:17.103 --> 03:56:19.556
LIAM: You're engaged. You don't have to--

03:56:19.556 --> 03:56:21.185
TALIESIN: Well.

03:56:21.185 --> 03:56:33.753
LAURA: I'm sorry I didn't tell you about that.
Engagement. But you know.

03:56:33.753 --> 03:56:38.501
MARISHA: You fucking liars. You fucking liars!
Just tell us! We know!

03:56:38.501 --> 03:56:44.766
LAURA: We got married.

03:56:44.766 --> 03:56:46.526
TALIESIN: We may have gotten married.

03:56:46.526 --> 03:56:48.989
MARISHA: Yeah. (sarcastically) Oh, surprise!

03:56:48.989 --> 03:56:53.475
TALIESIN: It was going to be--

03:56:53.475 --> 03:56:55.095
LAURA: (weakly) Celebration!

03:56:55.095 --> 03:57:00.662
TALIESIN: We didn't want to make it a thing. We
wanted it to just be--

03:57:00.662 --> 03:57:02.984
SAM: I think it's great.

03:57:02.984 --> 03:57:04.550
LAURA: Thank you, Scanlan.

03:57:04.550 --> 03:57:11.160
SAM: It's wonderful when two people can fall in
love and have each other forever and ever. That's

03:57:11.160 --> 03:57:18.743
nice. No, I mean it! You guys are great. You're
super cute together. You'll make Whitestone--

03:57:18.743 --> 03:57:21.526
You'll be celebrities there.

03:57:21.526 --> 03:57:24.073
TRAVIS: Do we have to get you gifts?

03:57:24.073 --> 03:57:26.905
SAM: No, they eloped, so we're clear.

03:57:26.905 --> 03:57:30.558
TALIESIN: Very specifically, no. This place.

03:57:30.558 --> 03:57:38.087
MARISHA: Yeah, it's amazing. And Keyleth lights up
her flame hands as she walks off in a fury.

03:57:38.087 --> 03:57:47.832
TALIESIN: Do you not know what this place means?
Am I the only one who understands what this place

03:57:47.832 --> 03:57:48.791
means?

03:57:48.791 --> 03:57:50.107
TRAVIS: I would love to know.

03:57:50.107 --> 03:57:51.570
TALIESIN: It all matters!

03:57:51.570 --> 03:57:52.883
LAURA: None of us have forgotten.

03:57:52.883 --> 03:58:03.793
TALIESIN: No, I mean, really! It all matters! So much, and
it's not going to go away! Nothing goes away!

03:58:03.793 --> 03:58:12.392
MARISHA: No, it only gets filed away in some
library where no one else can experience it except

03:58:12.392 --> 03:58:15.207
for, what, one, maybe two people ever.

03:58:15.207 --> 03:58:18.569
TALIESIN: One and two people are all that it takes
to experience something!

03:58:18.569 --> 03:58:28.483
MATT: An echoing voice billows out from the right
side of your troupe. A creaky, warm, matronly voice

03:58:28.483 --> 03:58:36.469
that surrounds and almost welcomes you with the
intonation of a grandmother. It says, "Nothing is

03:58:36.469 --> 03:58:44.654
"forever, Percival." You glance off to the right,
and you can see there's a break in the bookcase.

03:58:44.654 --> 03:58:55.887
To your right, you see the shelves have stopped
ahead in this direction to reveal a circular

03:58:55.887 --> 03:59:07.494
common area within the library, where the ground
domes downward into an 80-foot-wide concave pit of

03:59:07.494 --> 03:59:16.471
cushions and tables, all standing at odd angles
alongside this pit, but never sliding. Gravity

03:59:16.471 --> 03:59:26.104
seems to shift depending on where the dome stands.
These tables hold teacups and writing implements

03:59:26.104 --> 03:59:36.044
and various other décor, and things that involve
binding and writing. None of them slipping, all of

03:59:36.044 --> 03:59:44.958
them affixed to the table as the dome slowly comes
to a central rest. Long, spiraling streams of

03:59:44.958 --> 03:59:49.792
silver, blue, and gray silk descend from the
supposed ceiling that is beyond your sight, and

03:59:49.792 --> 03:59:56.598
they come down like drifting silks that push past
as you enter the area.

03:59:56.598 --> 04:00:07.502
Sitting 40 feet from you in the center of the
dome, no larger than a normal person, is an older

04:00:07.502 --> 04:00:17.734
woman with long, wavy silver hair. Her olive skin is
somewhat weathered and wrinkled around her almond

04:00:17.734 --> 04:00:28.093
eyes, but the warmth of her smile, and her vibrant
purple irises put you at ease immediately. Her

04:00:28.093 --> 04:00:31.967
blue and white robes tumble out from her form in
tendrils of parchment that snake through the

04:00:31.967 --> 04:00:46.452
pillows like roots. She smiles as you turn and see
her. "I felt that you would find me."

04:00:46.452 --> 04:00:48.931
And that's where we'll end tonight's session.

04:00:48.931 --> 04:00:56.081
SAM: Wow, Matt. Wow, Darin!

04:00:56.081 --> 04:01:01.516
LIAM: Can everybody watching still at home give a
round of applause for Darin?

04:01:01.516 --> 04:01:10.258
MATT: Seriously. If you're available, you may want
to, if you can, come and join us for the first

04:01:10.258 --> 04:01:14.466
half maybe. Not next week, but the week after
Comic Con, if you're interested. Because I want to

04:01:14.466 --> 04:01:17.152
roleplay out you meeting Ioun.

04:01:17.152 --> 04:01:22.200
DARIN: It would be an honor. You know how
important this is to me.

04:01:22.200 --> 04:01:24.845
MATT: Great. I'll look forward to having you back
in a couple weeks, then.

04:01:24.845 --> 04:01:28.028
DARIN: And I will see you next weekend, as well!

04:01:28.028 --> 04:01:36.194
MATT: Yes, indeed. Oh, Comic Con. Guys, thank you
so much. Great game, well done. Breaking stuff,

04:01:36.194 --> 04:01:41.018
apparently. Once again, we have no episode next
week because we'll be at Comic Con, but we have

04:01:41.018 --> 04:01:48.829
our panel on Saturday for Critical Role. Love you
guys, hope you have a wonderful night, and is it

04:01:48.829 --> 04:01:51.328
Thursday yet? Good night!

04:01:51.328 --> 04:08:19.721
