00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
MATT: Welcome, everyone, to tonight's episode of
Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.339
actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. My
name is Matthew Mercer, I'm the Dungeon Master.

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:12.906
For those who are returning, good to see you
again, and for those for the first time, welcome,

00:00:12.906 --> 00:00:19.056
and hopefully you're not too lost. So, Sam is on
his way right now, being in the usual traffic from

00:00:19.056 --> 00:00:25.998
wherever he comes from, being a professional.
Having a career that's functional and perpetually

00:00:25.998 --> 00:00:33.229
busy. Get here soon, Sam! Quickly, please! Drive
safe. Don't drive with children in the street.

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:37.069
Apparently, that was confusion from last time.
People thought that he was actually driving in

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:42.442
children. Like, he had problems with children and
traffic, and thought children in traffic. So, keep

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:46.028
your children out of traffic, if you don't mind.
That's a general Critical Role request.

00:00:46.028 --> 00:00:47.056
MARISHA: PSA.

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:55.114
MATT: PSA, yeah. Before we get started in this,
first and foremost, I want to say hello to our

00:00:55.114 --> 00:00:57.174
guest for the evening, Mr. Chris Hardwick.

00:00:57.174 --> 00:00:59.086
(cheering)

00:00:59.086 --> 00:01:00.846
CHRIS: Good to be here.

00:01:00.846 --> 00:01:03.006
MATT: Glad you could join us for tonight's game.

00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:06.952
CHRIS: Also very excited to be here on Ravenclaw
Appreciation Day: the best house, of course.

00:01:06.952 --> 00:01:08.170
MARISHA: Yes, that's true.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.694
CHRIS: Wit beyond measure is man's greatest
treasure.

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:10.743
LAURA: Hufflepuff!

00:01:10.743 --> 00:01:11.725
CHRIS: Well...

00:01:11.725 --> 00:01:14.168
TALIESIN: Slytherin. Slytherin. Ravenclaw's pretty
good. Pretty good.

00:01:14.168 --> 00:01:16.441
CHRIS: If by good, you mean the best.

00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:17.759
MATT: There you go.

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.538
CHRIS: I'm sorry, there's no--

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:23.743
SAM: Oh, shit! This is so awkward.

00:01:23.743 --> 00:01:26.075
TALIESIN: I thought we called you.

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:27.874
CHRIS: Can you stand near the bear?

00:01:27.874 --> 00:01:31.784
LAURA: His name is Trinket, all right?

00:01:31.784 --> 00:01:34.876
SAM: Is this how I was fired from the show?

00:01:34.876 --> 00:01:39.681
CHRIS: We thought we would do it on the livestream
just to really help capture the traffic that that

00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:40.845
would bring.

00:01:40.845 --> 00:01:44.534
SAM: Good luck. I think you're going to do great.
These guys will take care of you.

00:01:44.534 --> 00:01:47.671
CHRIS: I've been working with this guy for the
last couple of years on Sanjay &amp;amp; Craig. He gets

00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:53.596
all businessy, he's a responsible adult in the
workplace.

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:55.323
MATT: And then he comes here.

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:58.160
SAM: And then I come here. You're not, you're the
same.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.964
CHRIS: I can't wait to see this other side.

00:01:59.964 --> 00:02:01.436
SAM: Where am I supposed to sit?! Right here?

00:02:01.436 --> 00:02:03.912
MATT: Right there, yeah. Just scoot in.

00:02:03.912 --> 00:02:06.693
SAM: Is that true? I don't know. Are we scooting
over?

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:10.014
CHRIS: I would move over, but I need both. My
legs are--

00:02:10.014 --> 00:02:12.090
SAM: This is the most awkward.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.799
TALIESIN: It's like a New York subway over here.

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:21.663
CHRIS: Can you just rappel down that?

00:02:21.663 --> 00:02:24.104
MATT: There we go.

00:02:24.104 --> 00:02:25.816
LAURA: This is so awkward.

00:02:25.816 --> 00:02:29.660
SAM: I love it. No, no, I've got the half-table at
the end here. It's great.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.405
CHRIS: Matt, I don't like having people on my
right side. Is this weird?

00:02:34.405 --> 00:02:37.823
MATT: If becomes a problem, just raise your hand
and scream.

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:39.858
CHRIS: It's already a problem.

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:41.571
MATT: Oh, damn it!

00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:45.261
MARISHA: I'm technically at the end. This is on
Chris, really.

00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:46.977
LIAM: Can you scoot the whole bench down on this
side?

00:02:46.977 --> 00:02:49.675
LAURA: Yeah, scoot the bench down. Look at how far
the bench is on our side.

00:02:49.675 --> 00:02:52.937
TRAVIS: Put the leg of the table between here.

00:02:52.937 --> 00:02:59.357
MATT: Very well-oiled machine, Critical Role.

00:02:59.357 --> 00:03:02.590
LAURA: Thanks for joining us this week.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.064
MATT: The utmost of presentory quality we promise
to you on a weekly basis. Thank you for joining

00:03:08.064 --> 00:03:12.469
us. All right, so.

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:16.472
TRAVIS: Lock it up, right table, Jesus!

00:03:16.472 --> 00:03:18.112
SAM: Sorry, we're ready.

00:03:18.112 --> 00:03:23.644
MATT: Welcome, Sam, glad you could make it. Let's
get through our announcements quickly for the

00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:30.620
week. Tomorrow, a bunch of us are going to be at
Wondercon down at the LA Convention Center. Not

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.209
Anaheim. It's always been at Anaheim, and I
thought it was Anaheim when I mentioned it last

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.525
week. But, no, it's in LA because everything likes
to prove me wrong. We'll be there. 7:00-8:00pm is

00:03:39.525 --> 00:03:42.806
our Critical Role panel, so if you're in the area,
you're coming to the event, come say hello, bring

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:48.271
questions, preferably not punch me in the face for
getting it wrong with Anaheim.

00:03:48.271 --> 00:03:50.880
CHRIS: It used to be in San Francisco.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.215
MATT: Even before that!

00:03:52.215 --> 00:03:57.196
CHRIS: Yeah! I went to it at Moscone Center like
six or seven years ago, and then Anaheim. It's

00:03:57.196 --> 00:03:58.383
getting closer and closer.

00:03:58.383 --> 00:04:00.519
MARISHA: Yeah, it's going to be in Lancaster next
year.

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.616
TALIESIN: And the year after, it's going to be at
my house. It'll be great.

00:04:03.616 --> 00:04:08.407
MATT: We will go there for that. Going to
Lancaster for anything is a difficult choice.

00:04:08.407 --> 00:04:09.904
Sorry, Lancaster!

00:04:09.904 --> 00:04:12.227
LAURA: Longest announcements &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt;!

00:04:12.227 --> 00:04:17.531
MATT: I know! We have, tonight--

00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:19.041
MARISHA: Shirts!

00:04:19.041 --> 00:04:25.599
MATT: I'm getting to it! We had an issue last week
where a bunch of our Gilmore shirts sold out

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.028
really quickly.

00:04:27.028 --> 00:04:28.347
SAM: This shirt, right here?

00:04:28.347 --> 00:04:30.482
MATT: That shirt that you're wearing, the
Gilmore's Glorious Goods.

00:04:30.482 --> 00:04:32.516
LAURA: The one that everybody wants, but nobody
can have.

00:04:32.516 --> 00:04:33.818
SAM: I have it!

00:04:33.818 --> 00:04:35.219
MATT: That's terrible.

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:36.295
SAM: Oh, sorry.

00:04:36.295 --> 00:04:37.795
CHRIS: Do I have to sit next to him?

00:04:37.795 --> 00:04:39.003
TRAVIS: The whole time.

00:04:39.003 --> 00:04:40.927
SAM: Don't worry, I've already been emasculated.

00:04:40.927 --> 00:04:43.478
(laughter)

00:04:43.478 --> 00:04:51.680
MATT: We're counting it as community service,
it'll be fine. However, in trying to make sure

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.810
that we can help our folks who don't get to see it
live have an opportunity at these, we're going to

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.482
be starting for a week a limited pre-order for
Gilmore shirts. Should be up live now on the

00:05:00.482 --> 00:05:03.285
website. So if you didn't have the opportunity to
go ahead and grab your own Gilmore's Glorious

00:05:03.285 --> 00:05:07.816
Goods shirt, go to GeekandSundry.com right now, go
to their store, it should be available for

00:05:07.816 --> 00:05:09.518
pre-orders for the next week.

00:05:09.518 --> 00:05:11.477
LIAM: Grab this unicorn by the horn.

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:19.408
MATT: Yes. Yes. Grog-- Travis, but Grog. You're
wearing a delightful shirt, there. Would you like

00:05:19.408 --> 00:05:21.082
to tell us a bit about that shirt?

00:05:21.082 --> 00:05:22.896
TRAVIS: This is the next of our shirt designs--

00:05:22.896 --> 00:05:24.148
SAM: Oh, is that true?

00:05:24.148 --> 00:05:28.795
TRAVIS: -- the Strongjaw Ale shirt design, which
will be on sale tomorrow at our Wondercon panel

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:31.096
and the Geek and Sundry store as well.

00:05:31.096 --> 00:05:32.384
LIAM: That is manly.

00:05:32.384 --> 00:05:34.592
TRAVIS: Aged six months in a Bag of Holding.

00:05:34.592 --> 00:05:36.704
(laughter)

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.081
LAURA: You can read?

00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:39.729
TRAVIS: Upside-down only.

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.126
MATT: Makes sense. Anyone else have any
announcements they want to bring up?

00:05:44.126 --> 00:05:50.525
TALIESIN: Yeah, I can now be your companion, as of
this week, in Fallout 4, if you build a robot and

00:05:50.525 --> 00:05:53.654
give it the male voice, I can be really polite to
you for hours on end.

00:05:53.654 --> 00:05:55.425
LAURA and MATT: Yay!

00:05:55.425 --> 00:05:59.540
TALIESIN: You can have me be very polite. That's
the only way you can have me be very polite.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.832
MATT: You can make him very polite, and
apparently be sexy Codsworth, which is the new

00:06:01.832 --> 00:06:05.058
internet thing. It's the Codsworth top with the
normal legs at the bottom, and it's just sexy

00:06:05.058 --> 00:06:08.158
running Codsworth, with Taliesin's voice. So do
that.

00:06:08.158 --> 00:06:09.501
TALIESIN: That horrifies me.

00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:11.265
CHRIS: May I promote just a quick thing?

00:06:11.265 --> 00:06:12.373
MATT: Of course, please!

00:06:12.373 --> 00:06:15.128
CHRIS: We're doing the Nerdist panel Sunday at
Wondercon, and then I'm going to do a signing

00:06:15.128 --> 00:06:19.336
right afterwards, I think 11 and 12 are the two
times for that, and then, if you have a chance, I

00:06:19.336 --> 00:06:24.917
just posted on Facebook the full, unedited
episode. We did a Trump v. Sanders debate on

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:27.411
@Midnight last night, and it was really fun.

00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:28.600
MATT: It's awesome.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.207
CHRIS: And they extended it to an hour because it
was so much fun, so it's on Facebook now, and just

00:06:33.207 --> 00:06:35.945
go and share it, please, because we enjoyed making
it.

00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:37.363
MATT: It's awesome, seriously.

00:06:37.363 --> 00:06:38.477
CHRIS: Thank you very much.

00:06:38.477 --> 00:06:42.165
MATT: Of course, of course, yeah, check that one
out. I caught that earlier today, haphazardly, and

00:06:42.165 --> 00:06:43.584
I'm glad I did. And you'll be glad too.

00:06:43.584 --> 00:06:45.649
MARISHA: Did it trend on Twitter? That's where I
saw it.

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:50.732
CHRIS: It did, yeah, last night it did and then we
stuck it up today. And then a comedy special on

00:06:50.732 --> 00:06:53.521
Comedy Central, Funcomfortable, April 30th.

00:06:53.521 --> 00:06:56.017
MATT: April 30th. Heck yeah, man, congrats.

00:06:56.017 --> 00:06:57.564
(cheering)

00:06:57.564 --> 00:07:00.890
MATT: That'll be awesome. All righty.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:07.547
LIAM: Oh my gosh, 'critrole' is the code you need
for free shipping if you want Wyrmwood Gaming

00:07:07.547 --> 00:07:12.150
boxes to hold your dice in them. We all have them.
I have some at home. My kids love them. Critrole

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.965
is the code you need for free shipping.

00:07:14.965 --> 00:07:16.452
TRAVIS: (belches)

00:07:16.452 --> 00:07:19.846
CHRIS: I expected a bassier belch.

00:07:19.846 --> 00:07:22.982
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know, it comes from her, though,
she's like a howitzer, it's a whole other thing.

00:07:22.982 --> 00:07:25.285
LAURA: Yeah. I'll surprise you with it, don't
worry.

00:07:25.285 --> 00:07:27.925
TRAVIS: It'll make your shirt move, it's legit.

00:07:27.925 --> 00:07:30.563
MATT: No, like, she'll actually surprise you,
she'll wait until you're walking through a parking

00:07:30.563 --> 00:07:33.664
garage at two am and just over your shoulder
(belches).

00:07:33.664 --> 00:07:35.059
TRAVIS: Telephone rings. Hello? (belches)

00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:39.860
MATT: Exactly. She's good. Anyone have anything
else they want to announce before we jump into the

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.949
game?

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:42.872
SAM: I'm sitting on half a chair.

00:07:42.872 --> 00:07:44.557
MATT: Thank you for that, Sam.

00:07:44.557 --> 00:07:45.757
CHRIS: Scoot a cheek here.

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:47.444
SAM: No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:07:47.444 --> 00:07:49.044
LAURA: He's not fine.

00:07:49.044 --> 00:07:51.216
CHRIS: It was important enough for you to bring it
up, Sam.

00:07:51.216 --> 00:07:53.679
SAM: I'm fine, Christopher.

00:07:53.679 --> 00:07:57.218
LIAM: His character is small, but he has a big
personality.

00:07:57.218 --> 00:08:01.390
CHRIS: How do you do this every week?

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.134
MATT: That's a good, good question.

00:08:04.134 --> 00:08:05.805
TALIESIN: Normally sedated.

00:08:05.805 --> 00:08:11.981
MATT: All righty. So. Let's go ahead and jump into
this wondrous--

00:08:11.981 --> 00:08:13.693
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:20.583
MATT: So, to get you guys a little bit up to speed
with some of the fun that's happened previously on

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:28.123
Critical Role, our band of intrepid adventurers,
Vox Machina, after having a horrible encounter

00:08:28.123 --> 00:08:33.458
with the Chroma Conclave, a gathering of chromatic
evil dragons that has just torn through the

00:08:33.458 --> 00:08:41.013
Tal'Dorei countryside, destroying cityscape after
cityscape, the party has fled and has been seeking

00:08:41.013 --> 00:08:46.199
information on how to possibly eventually topple
these creatures and restore order to the land of

00:08:46.199 --> 00:08:51.051
Tal'Dorei. They began seeking these artifacts
known as the Vestiges of Divergence that promise

00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:56.427
ancient power from wars long past that could aid
them in this journey. After acquiring one, with a

00:08:56.427 --> 00:09:01.605
near-death experience by Vex'ahlia over there,
they began their next step in the journey.

00:09:01.605 --> 00:09:06.544
However, as part of a recent scrying spell by
Keyleth, the druid, they discovered that the Pyrah

00:09:06.544 --> 00:09:14.686
tribe of her druidic heritage, the Ashari, were
decimated as their home of Pyrah was the portal to

00:09:14.686 --> 00:09:20.127
the fire elemental plane that they normally guard,
was where Thordak the Cinder King, the great red

00:09:20.127 --> 00:09:26.546
dragon, tore through into this prime realm and
managed to seemingly wipe out most if not all of

00:09:26.546 --> 00:09:35.177
the tribe. Vox Machina made the relatively grim
journey back to the mountainside, finding it now

00:09:35.177 --> 00:09:41.628
brimming with volcanic rock and volcanic activity
that previously lay dormant. Upon climbing the

00:09:41.628 --> 00:09:47.426
side of the mountain, you found remnants of the
Pyrah tribe still alive, and making their way up

00:09:47.426 --> 00:09:52.535
the mountain, as damaged as they are, in hopes
of sealing this now progressively swelling tear

00:09:52.535 --> 00:09:58.139
between the prime material plane and the elemental
plane of fire. Not just that, there was aid that

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:04.789
came to the Pyrah tribe. And it involved a number
of Air Ashari, one of which was Korren, Keyleth's

00:10:04.789 --> 00:10:11.155
father. There was a brief, tearful exchange and
reunion before the rest of you, steeling

00:10:11.155 --> 00:10:17.017
yourselves, began to walk in towards the center of
the mountain's caldera, towards the remnants of

00:10:17.017 --> 00:10:22.282
the Cindergrove, the now-destroyed and sundered
petrified forest, in hopes of closing this

00:10:22.282 --> 00:10:32.376
rippling tear to the elemental plane once and for
all. And this is where we begin. So. The group of

00:10:32.376 --> 00:10:41.036
the six of you, gathering alongside the dozen or
so Pyrah members, with various burns, Cerkonos,

00:10:41.036 --> 00:10:47.602
who is the leader of the tribe, now missing his
arm, cauterized at the shoulder, all advancing

00:10:47.602 --> 00:10:54.933
forward quietly in this tense push of necessity.
You can see in the distance, swirling between the

00:10:54.933 --> 00:11:01.710
trees, clusters of glowing elemental entities that
are either spilling forth from this recently and

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:08.917
have taken this landscape as their own, or are
just enjoying in their-- elementals like to burn

00:11:08.917 --> 00:11:15.067
shit. And so you're seeing fire elementals wandering
about, just tearing through what remains of this

00:11:15.067 --> 00:11:23.504
countryside, and let's see, you actually,
Vex'ahlia-- as you guys are stepping forward,

00:11:23.504 --> 00:11:28.901
keeping an eye on these glowing distant entities,
these creatures, you catch out of the corner of

00:11:28.901 --> 00:11:34.917
your eye what appears to be a number of other
humanoids, a small cluster of shadowed individuals

00:11:34.917 --> 00:11:38.549
far off to the left, tucked around the bottom of a
tree.

00:11:38.549 --> 00:11:43.058
LAURA: I ask everyone to wait. Percy.

00:11:43.058 --> 00:11:44.100
TALIESIN: Yes?

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.308
LAURA: Can you look through your scope and see who
that is?

00:11:46.308 --> 00:11:49.251
TALIESIN: I'll take a look.

00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:51.173
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:11:51.173 --> 00:11:52.880
SAM: First roll.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.560
TALIESIN: Ooh. That's not bad.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.035
(eerie music)

00:11:56.035 --> 00:11:56.940
LAURA: The music.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.169
LIAM: The violins go south.

00:11:58.169 --> 00:11:59.329
TALIESIN: 23.

00:11:59.329 --> 00:12:05.527
MATT: 23. Glancing over in that direction, you
see, towards one of the larger, broken petrified

00:12:05.527 --> 00:12:12.195
trees, right on the outskirts of the Cindergrove
forest, you see what appear to be a cluster of

00:12:12.195 --> 00:12:20.502
humanoids. Two of them have flesh. The other two
do not. These skeletal creatures shuffle in place,

00:12:20.502 --> 00:12:26.197
clutching a blade to one side, while the other two
appear to be in partially rotted states. They're

00:12:26.197 --> 00:12:35.987
mostly disinterested in their surroundings and
stand there, head to the side, aimless--

00:12:35.987 --> 00:12:43.096
TALIESIN: Are they in the clothing of the natives,
or do they not look to be Ashari?

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:50.663
MATT: From what you can tell, one of them does
appear to have Ashari wardrobe. The other one does not.

00:12:50.663 --> 00:12:54.424
TRAVIS: -- he said in a weird way.

00:12:54.424 --> 00:12:57.104
TALIESIN: They look undead. Doesn't--

00:12:57.104 --> 00:13:01.028
LAURA: Are they from here?

00:13:01.028 --> 00:13:10.994
TALIESIN: Possibly. One looks vaguely familiar,
but there's something wrong. We should proceed--

00:13:10.994 --> 00:13:16.298
let's go up and find out what's happening. Slowly,
and armed.

00:13:16.298 --> 00:13:22.828
MATT: At this point, Korren, Keyleth's father and
the head of the Air Ashari in your absence, puts

00:13:22.828 --> 00:13:29.798
his hand forth and goes, "I'm sorry, you're saying
that you see along the way undead creatures."

00:13:29.798 --> 00:13:37.133
TALIESIN: Yes. There's something unnatural over in
that direction. We should probably be the ones to

00:13:37.133 --> 00:13:38.784
investigate.

00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:44.310
MATT: "All right. Given the nature of the
elemental presence here, we're going to have to

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:49.110
"probably divide and attack the central place from
multiple positions, otherwise they're going to

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:55.305
"have too strong of a fire-front at the edges of
this border. Do you feel confident enough to

00:13:55.305 --> 00:13:57.853
"handle your own sliver of this assault?"

00:13:57.853 --> 00:14:00.727
TRAVIS: (scoffs and laughs) Is he serious?

00:14:00.727 --> 00:14:05.225
MARISHA: Grog. I believe we can handle it.

00:14:05.225 --> 00:14:09.223
LAURA: We don't have a lot of magic wielders with
us, though.

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:10.862
MATT: "That's all right--"

00:14:10.862 --> 00:14:12.639
SAM: (clears throat) I'm pretty good.

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:14.171
LAURA: A lot of magic wielders.

00:14:14.171 --> 00:14:16.706
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're better than good, buddy.

00:14:16.706 --> 00:14:18.390
TALIESIN: You're okay.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:24.323
MATT: "Well, we'll keep an eye out. We'll have two
of our druids overhead, keeping eyesight. If

00:14:24.323 --> 00:14:29.108
"anything goes wrong, signal up there. You know
how, Keyleth. And we'll send them down to aid you.

00:14:29.108 --> 00:14:31.211
"All right."

00:14:31.211 --> 00:14:32.428
LAURA: Sounds good.

00:14:32.428 --> 00:14:37.287
MATT: "The air Ashari will come from the
northeast. Cerkonos, take the rest of your tribe,

00:14:37.287 --> 00:14:47.759
"head from the west. You, continue on forward. If
this troupe you've found of seemingly lifeless

00:14:47.759 --> 00:14:54.007
"entities looks even remotely dangerous, do not
engage. They are not our target. But if this is a

00:14:54.007 --> 00:14:59.828
"scourge that has spread into the Cindergrove, I
fear we may be in worse shape than I had

00:14:59.828 --> 00:15:08.201
"originally envisioned. Regardless, stay silent,
stay swift." He looks back to the rest of the Air

00:15:08.201 --> 00:15:13.248
Ashari, and all of them, their outer form shimmers
as the wind begins to collect around their feet,

00:15:13.248 --> 00:15:19.823
ever so quietly, and they all with an intense
speed begin to trek at an incredible pace,

00:15:19.823 --> 00:15:24.201
seemingly blending in with the rock surroundings
as they go, disappearing around one side of the

00:15:24.201 --> 00:15:29.316
Cindergrove forest. Cerkonos and the others nod.
Cerkonos looks to the rest of you, brings up his

00:15:29.316 --> 00:15:34.600
one hand and gives a touch to the top of his chest
and sternum and bows his head and goes, "I wish

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:43.161
"you all great luck. See you on the inside." And
the rest of the fire Ashari turn into burning fire

00:15:43.161 --> 00:15:48.901
elemental forms and begin to streak through the
various broken rocks and pieces of glass-shattered

00:15:48.901 --> 00:15:55.815
obsidian that peppered this landscape in the
caldera, leaving the six of you ready to trek

00:15:55.815 --> 00:15:57.306
forward yourself.

00:15:57.306 --> 00:15:58.664
TRAVIS: Scanlan, can you do that?

00:15:58.664 --> 00:16:02.350
SAM: Ah, no. No, and I don't think I could learn.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.482
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:16:03.482 --> 00:16:05.759
LAURA: Perfect. So.

00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:07.109
MARISHA: Let's go.

00:16:07.109 --> 00:16:08.137
LAURA: Avoid the skeletons?

00:16:08.137 --> 00:16:09.444
MARISHA: Avoid the skeletons.

00:16:09.444 --> 00:16:11.658
TALIESIN: Let's take a look, at least.

00:16:11.658 --> 00:16:12.653
MARISHA: What?

00:16:12.653 --> 00:16:15.697
TALIESIN: We're supposed to make sure they're not
part of something larger that's heading in--

00:16:15.697 --> 00:16:16.796
LAURA: They're in the way, Keyleth.

00:16:16.796 --> 00:16:18.604
MARISHA: Did you not just hear my father--

00:16:18.604 --> 00:16:22.419
TALIESIN: He said if they don't bother us, to
leave them alone, but that we should just check to

00:16:22.419 --> 00:16:23.961
make sure that they're not part of something.

00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:27.777
LAURA: Are they in the path at all, do they look
like they're going to be near us when we go?

00:16:27.777 --> 00:16:33.224
MATT: They look like, wherever you're traveling--
because there's an open expanse of about 80 or so

00:16:33.224 --> 00:16:36.988
feet before you actually reach the edge of the
Cindergrove, and they're right on the outskirts of

00:16:36.988 --> 00:16:41.817
the Cindergrove forest, so lest you're very
careful, they would technically see you if they're

00:16:41.817 --> 00:16:42.860
paying attention.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:43.907
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:16:43.907 --> 00:16:45.922
TALIESIN: Tread gently and see if they react.

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:48.119
MARISHA: Do you have Pass Without a Trace, Vex?

00:16:48.119 --> 00:16:53.968
LAURA: I do. But, Keyleth, the minute we start
fighting, they will notice us, and then they'll

00:16:53.968 --> 00:16:55.383
attack us from behind.

00:16:55.383 --> 00:17:00.239
TALIESIN: So it would be best to get their
attention now when everything's quiet.

00:17:00.239 --> 00:17:07.264
MARISHA: We also don't want to waste all of our
abilities on undead.

00:17:07.264 --> 00:17:11.508
TALIESIN: There's only two, maybe four of them.

00:17:11.508 --> 00:17:14.110
MATT: There's four of them.

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:15.741
LIAM: That we see.

00:17:15.741 --> 00:17:20.909
MARISHA: Why don't we just tread that way, and
we'll see what happens.

00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:22.620
TALIESIN: That's exactly what we're saying.

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:23.983
SAM: What could happen?

00:17:23.983 --> 00:17:26.458
LAURA: I guess I use Pass Without a Trace on all
of us.

00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:27.701
TALIESIN: You did.

00:17:27.701 --> 00:17:29.201
MARISHA: Did we already have it?

00:17:29.201 --> 00:17:31.898
LAURA: Did we already have it? From last time?

00:17:31.898 --> 00:17:35.007
MATT: As long as you're maintaining your
concentration, how long does it last for?

00:17:35.007 --> 00:17:37.348
Concentration? I believe it--

00:17:37.348 --> 00:17:39.396
LAURA: It holds for up to an hour.

00:17:39.396 --> 00:17:41.512
MATT: An hour, yeah, so you can still be under
that effect.

00:17:41.512 --> 00:17:42.656
LAURA: Sweet.

00:17:42.656 --> 00:17:45.005
MATT: So I would like all six of you to roll
stealth checks for me, if you could.

00:17:45.005 --> 00:17:47.400
TRAVIS: With triple advantage?

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.188
MATT: No. Just the plus ten. Which is better than
advantage.

00:17:51.188 --> 00:17:52.413
MARISHA: Triple advantage.

00:17:52.413 --> 00:17:53.608
TRAVIS: 25.

00:17:53.608 --> 00:17:54.795
TALIESIN: 30.

00:17:54.795 --> 00:17:56.786
MARISHA: 28.

00:17:56.786 --> 00:17:57.853
LIAM: 38.

00:17:57.853 --> 00:17:58.671
LAURA: 30.

00:17:58.671 --> 00:17:59.836
MATT: 38--

00:17:59.836 --> 00:18:01.030
SAM: 14.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.743
(laughter)

00:18:02.743 --> 00:18:03.590
MATT: With plus ten?

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:04.752
SAM: With the plus ten.

00:18:04.752 --> 00:18:05.631
MATT: All right.

00:18:05.631 --> 00:18:06.777
TRAVIS: Incredible.

00:18:06.777 --> 00:18:11.998
SAM: Tra-la-la-la-la.

00:18:11.998 --> 00:18:22.726
MATT: So as the entire group bends down into a
ninja-like stance, just darting across as fast as

00:18:22.726 --> 00:18:27.450
they can, keeping low to the ground and using much
of the shadow of the overhead clouds and smoke

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:35.690
that has completely engulfed the above skyscape,
behind you, bounding very loudly, is a gentle

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.598
gnome, swishing brown hair--

00:18:37.598 --> 00:18:39.770
SAM: I'm trying to do that thing that the Ashari
just did.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.572
MATT: Right. It's not working.

00:18:41.572 --> 00:18:43.490
LIAM: Hot, hot, hot.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:51.359
MATT: And as you're darting across, you're jumping
over little open globules of molten lava that is

00:18:51.359 --> 00:18:57.316
starting to pour out from various crevices in the
stone floor, you try to hop around to avoid that,

00:18:57.316 --> 00:19:03.323
and in doing so, your foot catches the edge of a
piece of stone, and you begin to go into a tumble.

00:19:03.323 --> 00:19:04.697
Make an acrobatics check.

00:19:04.697 --> 00:19:10.262
SAM: Oh, yes. Mm-hm. Oh, disadvantage, because I'm
exhausted.

00:19:10.262 --> 00:19:11.375
MATT: You are.

00:19:11.375 --> 00:19:13.060
LAURA: Oh, shit. I forgot about that.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.205
LIAM: The honest gnome.

00:19:14.205 --> 00:19:18.923
SAM: Okay. 14.

00:19:18.923 --> 00:19:25.192
MATT: (laughs) You do manage to catch yourself,
with a slight tumble, skid a bit on your ass, and

00:19:25.192 --> 00:19:28.342
land on your feet. It would've been a cool
three-point landing if anyone else had attempted

00:19:28.342 --> 00:19:33.882
it, but you just barely catch yourself, look back
at the group with a sheepish grin, and out of the

00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:40.251
corner of your eye, you see one of the undead entities
turn its head and look right in your direction.

00:19:40.251 --> 00:19:41.363
LAURA: (whispering) Good job, Scanlan.

00:19:41.363 --> 00:19:42.681
SAM: (whispering) I think it saw Grog.

00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:43.963
TRAVIS: Sorry.

00:19:43.963 --> 00:19:47.153
MATT: It starts wandering in your direction.

00:19:47.153 --> 00:19:49.716
SAM: Should we engage or keep going?

00:19:49.716 --> 00:19:54.257
MARISHA: I'm afraid if we engage, it could draw
attention to an entire slew of what could be

00:19:54.257 --> 00:19:55.266
around.

00:19:55.266 --> 00:19:57.333
TALIESIN: Let's just put it down quietly.

00:19:57.333 --> 00:19:59.176
MARISHA: All right, Jesus Christ.

00:19:59.176 --> 00:20:00.366
TALIESIN: No magic.

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:01.653
LAURA: No.

00:20:01.653 --> 00:20:02.791
TALIESIN: Just weapons.

00:20:02.791 --> 00:20:03.797
LAURA: No guns.

00:20:03.797 --> 00:20:06.108
TALIESIN: No guns. I pull my sword.

00:20:06.108 --> 00:20:09.562
MARISHA: Vex, you might be the most capable of
this.

00:20:09.562 --> 00:20:10.909
LAURA: I shoot it with an arrow.

00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:12.092
MATT: All right, roll for an attack.

00:20:12.092 --> 00:20:15.789
LAURA: Okay. Just going for it. Okay.

00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:16.709
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:20:16.709 --> 00:20:22.134
LAURA: I'm literally, I think I cursed myself
sometime between here and San Francisco.

00:20:22.134 --> 00:20:25.838
TALIESIN: The d20s talk to each other and they
know that you're not true.

00:20:25.838 --> 00:20:26.997
LAURA: 18.

00:20:26.997 --> 00:20:31.420
MATT: 18. That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:36.348
LIAM: Can I attack on her heels when she's done?

00:20:36.348 --> 00:20:41.167
MATT: At this distance, it'll take a little bit to
rush up if you want to--

00:20:41.167 --> 00:20:42.453
LIAM: 60 feet.

00:20:42.453 --> 00:20:46.425
MATT: I'll say at this point they're roughly 60
feet from you, so if you wanted to--

00:20:46.425 --> 00:20:48.126
LIAM: That's my distance.

00:20:48.126 --> 00:20:49.870
MATT: Oh, if you go full speed, you can.

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:50.924
MARISHA: Daggers.

00:20:50.924 --> 00:20:52.122
MATT: Oh, throwing it.

00:20:52.122 --> 00:20:53.160
LAURA: 15 damage.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.392
MATT: 15 damage. On which one, the skeleton or--

00:20:54.392 --> 00:20:57.215
LAURA: Oh, that's sneak attack, right? Because I'm
hidden.

00:20:57.215 --> 00:21:02.207
MATT: It would be from you, yes. The--

00:21:02.207 --> 00:21:03.479
LAURA: Extra two.

00:21:03.479 --> 00:21:06.619
MATT: What? Extra two. Okay. Is this against one
of the zombies or one of the skeletons?

00:21:06.619 --> 00:21:10.410
LAURA: I was doing the one that was walking
towards us, I thought the other ones were still in

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:11.259
the area--

00:21:11.259 --> 00:21:12.607
MATT: All right, then that would be one of the
zombies.

00:21:12.607 --> 00:21:13.806
LAURA: Yeah, okay.

00:21:13.806 --> 00:21:18.244
MATT: All right. The arrow streaks through the
air, slamming into the chest, and it embeds

00:21:18.244 --> 00:21:23.961
itself, causing a piece of tendon to snap and curl
back inside the torso. Its arm falls a little more

00:21:23.961 --> 00:21:27.656
limp than it was previously, and it just keeps
walking forward.

00:21:27.656 --> 00:21:28.975
LAURA: I hide.

00:21:28.975 --> 00:21:31.783
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll a stealth
check. You--

00:21:31.783 --> 00:21:34.664
LIAM: They're all grouped together?

00:21:34.664 --> 00:21:38.723
MATT: Three of them are grouped together by the
tree. The one that noticed is slowly wandering

00:21:38.723 --> 00:21:39.765
toward you.

00:21:39.765 --> 00:21:41.461
LIAM: All right, so I'm going to throw at that one
as well.

00:21:41.461 --> 00:21:42.309
MATT: Okay.

00:21:42.309 --> 00:21:44.349
LAURA: 39. Stealth.

00:21:44.349 --> 00:21:45.521
MATT: All right.

00:21:45.521 --> 00:21:49.660
LIAM: I'm just going to throw one, and just to
check, I'm hidden, yeah?

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.571
MATT: Correct.

00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:54.116
LIAM: So this is Assassinate, I have advantage
because it hasn't gone yet, and it's a crit

00:21:54.116 --> 00:21:55.655
because I'm surprising it.

00:21:55.655 --> 00:21:56.739
MATT: Mm-hm.

00:21:56.739 --> 00:22:04.851
LIAM: 25.

00:22:04.851 --> 00:22:12.191
MATT: 25. With that, as this zombie entity is
hobbling forward, the dagger strikes it right in

00:22:12.191 --> 00:22:19.562
the center of the skull, right where its mouth and
jaw hinge hit, severs the base of the skull to the

00:22:19.562 --> 00:22:24.193
spine, and the head just rolls off onto the ground
underneath. The body takes two more steps before

00:22:24.193 --> 00:22:27.032
falling forward.

00:22:27.032 --> 00:22:31.305
LAURA: Yeah, do they all-- did any of the other
ones notice that?

00:22:31.305 --> 00:22:37.121
MATT: All the other undead creatures all of a
sudden turn into the forest, as opposed to towards where

00:22:37.121 --> 00:22:39.826
the death happened--

00:22:39.863 --> 00:22:40.632
LAURA: Ah, shit.

00:22:40.632 --> 00:22:44.513
MATT: And you see running out from the forest
towards you, a blue-skinned humanoid, rushing out,

00:22:44.513 --> 00:22:47.394
arms in the air.

00:22:47.394 --> 00:22:52.788
CHRIS: (in an Irish accent) Stop, stop, stop what
you're doing! Stop it! What have you done? What

00:22:52.788 --> 00:23:01.651
have you fucking done? It wasn't hurting anybody!
I don't understand it. Jesus Christ, these are not

00:23:01.651 --> 00:23:03.190
easy to make.

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:04.524
TRAVIS: Are we killing this one?

00:23:04.524 --> 00:23:07.680
SAM: No, no, don't kill him, he's precious.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.050
CHRIS: What did I do?

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.411
SAM: Who are you? Who are you?

00:23:10.411 --> 00:23:13.486
CHRIS: Who are you, you're fucking shooting at me,
you're asking me questions!

00:23:13.486 --> 00:23:16.375
SAM: But these are zombies, these are undead,
these are creatures of evil!

00:23:16.375 --> 00:23:17.809
LAURA: They were attacking us, they were attacking
him!

00:23:17.809 --> 00:23:19.240
CHRIS: These were in my employ.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.205
SAM: Oh.

00:23:20.205 --> 00:23:22.420
LAURA: Well, you should keep a leash on them,
then.

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.134
CHRIS: That would be inhumane, wouldn't it?

00:23:24.134 --> 00:23:26.183
SAM: They're not human.

00:23:26.183 --> 00:23:29.194
CHRIS: Well, they were, that's very disrespectful
of you, I don't appreciate it.

00:23:29.194 --> 00:23:31.637
LIAM: Are they pets? Are they friends? Where were
you--

00:23:31.637 --> 00:23:33.007
CHRIS: They're friend-pets.

00:23:33.007 --> 00:23:35.796
LIAM: You have to be around, though. To keep an
eye on them.

00:23:35.796 --> 00:23:41.199
CHRIS: I know, but I've been traveling out here
for a while, and so they provide a layer of

00:23:41.199 --> 00:23:46.572
protection. Certainly not great now. Now they were
four, now there's three.

00:23:46.572 --> 00:23:50.494
LIAM: Well, listen, when we see these things
without an owner around, we take them out, I'm

00:23:50.494 --> 00:23:52.284
sorry, it's pretty standard.

00:23:52.284 --> 00:23:54.338
SAM: This can't be the first time this has
happened.

00:23:54.338 --> 00:23:59.441
CHRIS: It does happen quite a lot, actually, yes.
Now that I think about it, it's probably a little

00:23:59.441 --> 00:24:01.036
bit on me, I suppose.

00:24:01.036 --> 00:24:04.240
SAM: Can you make them vests or something that
says 'service'?

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.877
CHRIS: That's a nice idea, as I'm a vest-maker.

00:24:06.877 --> 00:24:09.696
LAURA: Put them in a bright color, put a happy
mask on them or something, so people know they're

00:24:09.696 --> 00:24:10.782
nice.

00:24:10.782 --> 00:24:13.898
CHRIS: Certainly, yeah, yeah, masks and vests,
that's a great idea.

00:24:13.898 --> 00:24:19.606
MATT: You see agreeing before you a blue-scaled
dragonborn. If you would like to describe yourself

00:24:19.606 --> 00:24:20.848
for the party.

00:24:20.848 --> 00:24:27.726
CHRIS: Yes, sorry, I forgot. Where are my manners?
My name is Gern Blanston.

00:24:27.726 --> 00:24:29.413
SAM: No, it's not.

00:24:29.413 --> 00:24:30.585
CHRIS: It's Gern Blanston.

00:24:30.585 --> 00:24:32.075
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

00:24:32.075 --> 00:24:33.616
CHRIS: This one's very rude.

00:24:33.616 --> 00:24:34.783
TRAVIS: He is.

00:24:34.783 --> 00:24:38.194
CHRIS: You look exhausted.

00:24:38.194 --> 00:24:44.724
SAM: This volcano-- do you live near here? This
volcano really takes the piss out of you.

00:24:44.724 --> 00:24:50.866
CHRIS: No, no, no, I don't live near here. Listen,
I've been traveling, I'm a simple candlemaker.

00:24:50.866 --> 00:24:53.782
SAM: What are you doing on top of a volcano?

00:24:53.782 --> 00:24:58.306
CHRIS: A volcano is nature's candle! What a stupid
question.

00:24:58.306 --> 00:25:01.576
LAURA: You make candles, but you also make
undead?

00:25:01.576 --> 00:25:05.970
CHRIS: Yes. They're-- yes. They're like
people-candles.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:08.079
LAURA: Can I insight and see if he's telling the
truth?

00:25:08.079 --> 00:25:09.009
MATT: Go for it.

00:25:09.009 --> 00:25:11.216
LIAM: Our lives are so bizarre now.

00:25:11.216 --> 00:25:15.756
LAURA: 17.

00:25:15.756 --> 00:25:21.445
MATT: 17. He's telling the truth.

00:25:21.445 --> 00:25:26.171
CHRIS: Why is my brain tingling? Is someone
noodling around inside there?

00:25:26.171 --> 00:25:34.939
MATT: She eyes you up and down, trying to get a
feel for whether or not you're who you say you are.

00:25:34.939 --> 00:25:39.850
CHRIS: I make special candles. I make special
candles. I'm searching for some magical items up

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:45.792
here in this volcano. I understand there was a wee
bit of damage not long ago from a dragon that had

00:25:45.792 --> 00:25:51.739
torn through the region, and so I'm just searching
for scraps to make these simple candles. That's

00:25:51.739 --> 00:26:01.812
why-- this is my dance vest. I think dancing is
very important. I'm alone most of the time, it

00:26:01.812 --> 00:26:06.028
keeps me occupied. They have no appreciation for
the arts, these undead creatures that are

00:26:06.028 --> 00:26:11.797
friend-pets, and, you know, I've just been digging
around up here, seeing what I can scrounge up and

00:26:11.797 --> 00:26:13.466
find. What are you lot?

00:26:13.466 --> 00:26:16.222
TRAVIS: Wait, are they special candles or are they
simple candles?

00:26:16.222 --> 00:26:22.770
CHRIS: Well, some are simple. Some just create
light, and others create tragedy for people.

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:24.412
SAM: They're magical candles?

00:26:24.412 --> 00:26:27.324
CHRIS: Yes, in a word. Actually, magic is the
perfect word.

00:26:27.324 --> 00:26:33.028
MARISHA: Who exactly is the patronage of your
candle business? Who do you sell to?

00:26:33.028 --> 00:26:39.202
CHRIS: I mean, I sell to no one in particular,
really. I have to be a little choosy about who

00:26:39.202 --> 00:26:42.946
gets the candles, but it's something that I've
crafted over the years.

00:26:42.946 --> 00:26:46.974
SAM: Well, we feel dreadful about killing one of
your pets.

00:26:46.974 --> 00:26:48.518
MARISHA: I'm so sorry.

00:26:48.518 --> 00:26:52.446
SAM: Perhaps we can purchase a candle off of you
to make amends.

00:26:52.446 --> 00:26:55.636
CHRIS: Well, maybe you could just kill someone
else, and then I could just bring them back, I

00:26:55.636 --> 00:26:57.522
mean, that would be a wonderful way to repay.

00:26:57.522 --> 00:27:00.494
LAURA: Well, you know what, we're on our way to do
just that thing.

00:27:00.494 --> 00:27:01.697
CHRIS: Really?

00:27:01.697 --> 00:27:03.641
MARISHA: Things do tend to die around us a lot.

00:27:03.641 --> 00:27:05.833
TRAVIS: Something larger things, sometimes smaller
things.

00:27:05.833 --> 00:27:09.290
SAM: Would you like a body to reanimate or
something?

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:11.089
MARISHA: You might get something even bigger.

00:27:11.089 --> 00:27:12.838
CHRIS: Are you inviting me to come along with
you?

00:27:12.838 --> 00:27:14.352
SAM: I don't know. Are we?

00:27:14.352 --> 00:27:16.950
CHRIS: Did I just invite myself to come along with
you?

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:21.801
TRAVIS: Well maybe, like, if you give us one of
those tragedy candles, we can always light it for

00:27:21.801 --> 00:27:24.086
somebody. That could be good down the road.

00:27:24.086 --> 00:27:30.381
MARISHA: Oh, like candles for funerals? That's
sad. We do have a lot of tragedy.

00:27:30.381 --> 00:27:33.182
TRAVIS: We bake somebody a cake, we shove a candle
in the top, and we give it to them.

00:27:33.182 --> 00:27:37.316
CHRIS: I don't think that would be a grand idea
unless you didn't like the person very much.

00:27:37.316 --> 00:27:38.910
TRAVIS: Well, that's what I meant, yeah.

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:44.670
CHRIS: Well, I think for now I'll just hold onto
the candles I have and just see how things pan

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.478
out. I really don't know any of you.

00:27:47.478 --> 00:27:51.738
SAM: We're Vox Machina, a traveling band of
adventurers led by me, Scanlan Shorthalt, and

00:27:51.779 --> 00:27:57.816
these are my compatriots. We're on a very
important mission to get-- what are we doing?

00:27:57.816 --> 00:28:02.148
MARISHA: We're trying to close this giant rift
that we're walking into.

00:28:02.148 --> 00:28:04.467
SAM: We have to break something big and scary.

00:28:04.467 --> 00:28:05.891
CHRIS: What's your name again?

00:28:05.891 --> 00:28:06.943
SAM: Scanlan Shorthalt.

00:28:06.943 --> 00:28:08.260
CHRIS: No, what's the name of your group?

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.259
LAURA: Vox Machina.

00:28:09.259 --> 00:28:11.301
CHRIS: No offense, but that sounds like a shite
band.

00:28:11.301 --> 00:28:13.434
LAURA: Thank you.

00:28:13.434 --> 00:28:14.644
CHRIS: Are you musicians?

00:28:14.644 --> 00:28:18.072
TALIESIN: It's better than Tragedy Candle, really,
I mean that's a shite band, to be fair.

00:28:18.072 --> 00:28:27.292
CHRIS: (laughs) They opened for Vox Machina. They
were fantastic. Oh, am I not thinking of the right

00:28:27.292 --> 00:28:28.827
thing? That's all right.

00:28:28.827 --> 00:28:30.436
SAM: I'm a musician.

00:28:30.436 --> 00:28:31.566
CHRIS: Excellent.

00:28:31.566 --> 00:28:35.461
SAM: But these people, they can't really hold a
tune so much.

00:28:35.461 --> 00:28:40.732
CHRIS: Listen, seeing as how that you've killed
one of my undead thralls, it'd be really nice if I

00:28:40.732 --> 00:28:44.518
could join you to see if maybe we can scrounge up
some other things along the way.

00:28:44.518 --> 00:28:45.860
LAURA: Then you'll help us?

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:51.138
CHRIS: I mean, we'll see how it pans out, but I
feel like everything would come to an abrupt

00:28:51.138 --> 00:28:53.523
ending if I just walked away at this point.

00:28:53.523 --> 00:28:54.879
LAURA: It would be very strange.

00:28:54.879 --> 00:28:58.000
CHRIS: Thoroughly unsatisfying for anyone else who
might be witnessing this exchange.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.966
SAM: Your undead pets, are they going to try and
eat our brains or anything?

00:29:01.966 --> 00:29:06.157
CHRIS: No, no, they're just fine. That right there
is Coral, and that's Stimpy, and that's Fatty

00:29:06.157 --> 00:29:07.181
Arbuckle.

00:29:07.181 --> 00:29:08.938
SAM: Who was the one that we killed?

00:29:08.938 --> 00:29:11.839
CHRIS: Oh, that was Carol. Very sad, very sad
indeed.

00:29:11.839 --> 00:29:13.386
LAURA: Carol and Coral?

00:29:13.386 --> 00:29:15.547
CHRIS: Carol and Coral. I get them confused.

00:29:15.547 --> 00:29:16.713
MARISHA: Were they sisters?

00:29:16.713 --> 00:29:21.925
CHRIS: No, no, no, they were not initially
related, but we became a makeshift family after a

00:29:21.925 --> 00:29:22.889
while.

00:29:22.889 --> 00:29:24.125
SAM: Oh, that's very beautiful.

00:29:24.125 --> 00:29:28.218
CHRIS: I notice subtle differences that most of
the living doesn't notice.

00:29:28.218 --> 00:29:30.354
TRAVIS: Aren't we supposed to be doing something
really like--

00:29:30.354 --> 00:29:32.780
LAURA: Yeah, tell you what, Gern, we're
actually--

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.974
LIAM: It's dangerous around us, I don't know--

00:29:34.974 --> 00:29:38.202
LAURA: We should probably press on, and you can
join us with your family.

00:29:38.202 --> 00:29:40.019
CHRIS: Please, that would be very nice.

00:29:40.019 --> 00:29:41.521
TRAVIS: What was your name, one more time?

00:29:41.521 --> 00:29:42.699
CHRIS: Gern Blanston.

00:29:42.699 --> 00:29:43.760
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:44.581
CHRIS: Gern.

00:29:44.581 --> 00:29:48.261
TRAVIS: Well, let's go, let's move along then,
Gern, yeah? You good to come along with your herd of--

00:29:48.261 --> 00:29:50.500
SAM: Can you fight and stuff in case shit goes
down?

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.645
MARISHA: If you make magical candles, you must
know a little bit of magic, correct?

00:29:53.645 --> 00:29:58.188
CHRIS: I'm a little bit better of a spellcaster
than I am a fisticuffs type of person.

00:29:58.188 --> 00:29:59.308
MARISHA: Okay.

00:29:59.308 --> 00:30:02.593
LAURA: Perfect. We're short on magic people.
That's wonderful.

00:30:02.593 --> 00:30:04.142
CHRIS: Excellent. No offense.

00:30:04.142 --> 00:30:06.393
SAM: All taken.

00:30:06.393 --> 00:30:10.214
TRAVIS: We move along.

00:30:10.214 --> 00:30:14.953
LAURA: Are we still trying to stealth? Or does it
even matter?

00:30:15.021 --> 00:30:17.879
LIAM: Your dead things don't stealth, I would
assume?

00:30:17.879 --> 00:30:25.333
CHRIS: They're not very delicate, unfortunately.
No, no, they're really for protection. Now, the

00:30:25.333 --> 00:30:29.149
zombies can really take a lot of damage to the
front of the chest and the skeletons are quite

00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:33.406
quick, actually. So, you know. They've been fairly
good for a while.

00:30:33.406 --> 00:30:34.240
LAURA: All right.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.448
TALIESIN: Good to know.

00:30:35.448 --> 00:30:37.997
LAURA: We head towards the thing.

00:30:37.997 --> 00:30:39.145
TRAVIS: Stealthily.

00:30:39.145 --> 00:30:40.372
CHRIS: To the thing!

00:30:40.372 --> 00:30:41.974
TRAVIS: Shush! Stealthily.

00:30:41.974 --> 00:30:43.448
CHRIS: (whispering) To the thing!

00:30:43.448 --> 00:30:46.621
MATT: Go ahead and make a stealth check, if you
don't mind, Gern.

00:30:46.621 --> 00:30:49.289
LAURA: Does my Pass Without a Trace work on him
too, does it like envelop him--

00:30:49.289 --> 00:30:51.672
MATT: Nope. He wasn't there when you cast it.

00:30:51.672 --> 00:30:52.755
CHRIS: 11.

00:30:52.755 --> 00:30:53.776
TRAVIS: Fuck.

00:30:53.776 --> 00:30:54.622
MATT: 11?

00:30:54.622 --> 00:30:55.918
TALIESIN: He's not under Pass Without a Trace.

00:30:55.918 --> 00:31:01.843
MATT: No, and then-- No. As you guys begin
stealthily, there is a couple of (footfalls) heavy

00:31:01.843 --> 00:31:03.353
footfalls of the lumbering dragonborn.

00:31:03.353 --> 00:31:04.692
CHRIS: These old dragon feet--

00:31:04.692 --> 00:31:07.368
MATT: No tail on this one.

00:31:07.368 --> 00:31:09.711
SAM: What happened to your tail?

00:31:09.711 --> 00:31:11.160
CHRIS: Please don't ask me about that.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.133
SAM: Okay, I won't.

00:31:12.133 --> 00:31:15.231
MATT: The only other dragonborn you've seen
without a tail was the paladin that worked in the

00:31:15.231 --> 00:31:22.736
Council. Tofor Brotorus. So, that does catch your
attention a little bit. Not just the dragonborn

00:31:22.736 --> 00:31:27.380
lumbering, but now the three undead that are
(groaning) stepping behind.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.623
LAURA: They're worse than Trinket, Scanlan.

00:31:29.623 --> 00:31:31.899
MARISHA: I don't know. I don't know if stealth is
going to be a thing, going forward.

00:31:31.899 --> 00:31:33.689
TALIESIN: (whistling)

00:31:33.689 --> 00:31:36.729
TRAVIS: Yeah! (whistles)

00:31:36.729 --> 00:31:37.905
LAURA: Okay.

00:31:37.905 --> 00:31:43.680
CHRIS: Sorry, these dragon lips can't whistle.
Mostly just fire comes out.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:49.781
MATT: And it's at that point you hear the cracking
of what sounds like heavy timber, no more than 30

00:31:49.781 --> 00:31:53.898
feet away from you. You all stop in place suddenly
and you glance over and you can see the flickering

00:31:53.898 --> 00:31:59.975
of light of what appears to be a flame-based
elemental energy that's tearing over the side of a

00:31:59.975 --> 00:32:03.265
newly fallen petrifoid-- petrifoid-- (mocking
Chris' accent) petrifoid tree, look what you've

00:32:03.265 --> 00:32:05.785
done to me! This is your fault!

00:32:05.785 --> 00:32:08.106
TRAVIS: Gern, son of a bitch.

00:32:08.106 --> 00:32:12.695
CHRIS: Purple hearts, green stars! Purple hearts.

00:32:12.695 --> 00:32:15.259
SAM: Seen some shit.

00:32:15.259 --> 00:32:19.900
CHRIS: Special veteran's edition of Lucky Charms.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.761
MATT: Very, very Lucky Charms.

00:32:22.761 --> 00:32:24.117
CHRIS: Very Lucky Charms.

00:32:24.117 --> 00:32:25.742
LIAM: Shit.

00:32:25.742 --> 00:32:27.609
MATT: So!

00:32:27.609 --> 00:32:29.040
TALIESIN: Well, that got dark.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.569
MATT: Yeah, how about that?

00:32:30.569 --> 00:32:32.044
LIAM: Back to normal, then, eh?

00:32:32.044 --> 00:32:33.060
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:36.234
MATT: So. As the flame begins to trickle and burn
over the edge, you can see there is an

00:32:36.234 --> 00:32:39.782
intelligence to it. There are a couple of arms
that writhe over the side and the head pops

00:32:39.782 --> 00:32:45.154
over and glances, and stops in place, frozen,
staring over in the direction of the bounding

00:32:45.154 --> 00:32:46.637
dragonborn.

00:32:46.637 --> 00:32:48.497
MARISHA: It's a fire elemental?

00:32:48.497 --> 00:32:52.641
MATT: It's smaller than what you're used to
seeing, but it is indeed a creature made of

00:32:52.641 --> 00:32:54.120
elemental flame.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:33:01.770
MARISHA: Would he be considered a primordial?

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:05.262
MATT: It would be considered an elemental.

00:33:05.262 --> 00:33:08.408
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to go fire elemental.

00:33:08.408 --> 00:33:11.215
MATT: Okay. So you're using your transform--

00:33:11.215 --> 00:33:13.901
MARISHA: Seeing it, I'm going to transform and go
into my fire elemental.

00:33:13.901 --> 00:33:15.229
TRAVIS: Is this the first time you've done that?

00:33:15.229 --> 00:33:16.599
LAURA: No no, she's done that.

00:33:16.599 --> 00:33:19.384
MARISHA: Is this the first time I've been fire
elemental?

00:33:19.384 --> 00:33:20.940
MATT: I think it's the first time you've been fire
elemental, yeah?

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:21.988
LAURA: Really?

00:33:21.988 --> 00:33:23.405
MARISHA: Yeah, learned from Cerkonos, yeah.

00:33:23.405 --> 00:33:26.012
MATT: So, you guys watch as Keyleth's form
suddenly erupts into flame, which freaks you out

00:33:26.012 --> 00:33:29.456
for a second, as you're uncertain as to whether or
not she did that.

00:33:29.456 --> 00:33:32.206
TRAVIS: Keyleth! Are you all right?

00:33:32.206 --> 00:33:35.884
MARISHA: In fire elemental, just like--

00:33:35.884 --> 00:33:37.967
LAURA: Does it still look like Keyleth or-- what
does it look like?

00:33:37.967 --> 00:33:44.153
MATT: It has for a moment, an essence of Keyleth's
more lithe form that most elementals would, but

00:33:44.153 --> 00:33:49.588
still these long, curling flame like-arms, these
eyes that glow a bright white fire in the center

00:33:49.588 --> 00:33:53.085
of the face. Other than that, relatively formless
other than what looks like where her hair would

00:33:53.085 --> 00:33:55.921
be, these wisps of flame curl up behind her.

00:33:55.921 --> 00:34:01.009
LAURA: Pretty freaking sick. Can you talk to it?

00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:02.748
MARISHA: That's what I'm going to go do.

00:34:02.748 --> 00:34:04.130
MATT: So as you approach the elemental form--

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:10.727
MARISHA: So I approach and I'm going to do the
animal instinct thing and poof up and make myself

00:34:10.727 --> 00:34:12.080
a little big.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:17.852
MATT: The creature behind the form, you can see,
is drifting away from the trunk of the tree.

00:34:17.852 --> 00:34:19.497
MARISHA: Oh, it's running from me?

00:34:19.497 --> 00:34:21.388
MATT: It's turned away and is moving away from
you, yeah.

00:34:21.388 --> 00:34:22.863
SAM: That was easy.

00:34:22.863 --> 00:34:27.966
MARISHA: Deuces. And I roll back.

00:34:27.966 --> 00:34:30.630
LAURA: I thought we were supposed to keep them
from coming out into this world.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:34.237
MARISHA: Are we-- wait. Are we in the fire plane
yet?

00:34:34.237 --> 00:34:37.123
MATT: No no, you're just-- you're in the caldera
to--

00:34:37.123 --> 00:34:38.406
MARISHA: Oh, we're in the caldera.

00:34:38.406 --> 00:34:42.755
MATT: Yeah, you haven't traversed the plane.
You're making your way into the remnants of the

00:34:42.755 --> 00:34:43.734
Cindergrove.

00:34:43.734 --> 00:34:45.234
LAURA: Maybe you should ask it to go back.

00:34:45.234 --> 00:34:50.417
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to say "Halt!" in Ignan.
Which I'm assuming it speaks.

00:34:50.417 --> 00:34:56.180
MATT: You guys hear in the distance this echo of
this weird sucking-crackling sound that goes-- It

00:34:56.180 --> 00:35:03.533
halts for a second, looks over its shoulder and
then goes into double speed, disappearing into the

00:35:03.533 --> 00:35:05.092
trees. Away from you.

00:35:05.092 --> 00:35:09.580
TRAVIS: Kind of following your lead here.

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:18.835
MARISHA: I follow after it and I say, in the name
of the guardians of this realm, you will stop!

00:35:18.835 --> 00:35:24.355
MATT: Okay, as you follow it past the initial
treeline, it's where a bunch of trees have fallen

00:35:24.355 --> 00:35:29.337
over and formed a small blockade in this portion
of the forest. You glance over as you're shouting

00:35:29.337 --> 00:35:36.092
that and you can see what appear to be another of
the same small elemental that this one has gone

00:35:36.092 --> 00:35:42.294
to, to have a brief conversation. Beyond that, you
see a larger one, roughly your size, that has just

00:35:42.294 --> 00:35:46.383
turned around and noticed your presence, and all
of them look over at what appears to be another

00:35:46.383 --> 00:35:53.100
humanoid creature, but instead of a lower torso of
legs, it's an elongated snake-like body, its black

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:59.578
and red scales across its entire form, two human
arms and a humanoid face but these webbed red

00:35:59.578 --> 00:36:01.625
spines down its entire back.

00:36:01.625 --> 00:36:05.383
SAM: Gern, is that one of yours? That's you, Gern.
Gern.

00:36:05.383 --> 00:36:10.745
CHRIS: No, I don't know who this is. I don't-- I'm
not familiar. I'm not familiar with who this is.

00:36:10.745 --> 00:36:12.721
LAURA: I take my potion of fire resistance.

00:36:12.721 --> 00:36:17.607
CHRIS: I could send them a present in the form of
a candle, if you prefer.

00:36:17.607 --> 00:36:19.248
LAURA: Do it.

00:36:19.248 --> 00:36:22.786
MATT: At this point in time, Keyleth, as you're
standing there, looking over this edge, they all

00:36:22.786 --> 00:36:33.325
turn and the creature, the weird-- I'll say it-- a
salamander-like creature, begins shouting out

00:36:33.325 --> 00:36:40.515
phrases in Ignan, which you understand. It says,
"Go! He's not here yet! Alleviate this

00:36:40.515 --> 00:36:48.021
"uncontrolled one!" At which point, they all begin
to swarm towards you.

00:36:48.021 --> 00:36:59.535
MARISHA: At which point I'm going to do a fire
intimidation tactic. I'm going to do a fire radial

00:36:59.535 --> 00:37:10.276
thing. And I'm going to say, as the leader of this
realm, as the Kaitaki of the Fire Nation, you will

00:37:10.276 --> 00:37:13.433
heed my word.

00:37:13.433 --> 00:37:15.269
CHRIS: Quite dramatic, isn't she?

00:37:15.269 --> 00:37:21.816
MATT: As you guys are watching this from a
distance, all you hear is (guttural noises). It's

00:37:21.816 --> 00:37:23.982
really confusing and a little hilarious, to be
honest.

00:37:23.982 --> 00:37:25.531
LAURA: I think it's going well.

00:37:25.531 --> 00:37:27.923
MATT: I need you to make an intimidation check.

00:37:27.923 --> 00:37:38.825
MARISHA: No, that one fails me a lot.

00:37:38.825 --> 00:37:40.863
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure it fails you.

00:37:40.863 --> 00:37:42.210
MATT: What you got, Keyleth?

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:44.892
MARISHA: It does! Shut up, Travis. Natural 20!

00:37:44.892 --> 00:37:47.421
TRAVIS: Ha. Thought I made a point.

00:37:47.421 --> 00:37:52.677
MATT: All right. As this happens, the two smaller
elementals shrink down and glance over at the

00:37:52.677 --> 00:37:59.701
larger one. The larger one looks about and shouts
back at you in Ignan, once again: "Do you serve him?"

00:37:59.701 --> 00:38:11.663
MARISHA: It doesn't matter who I serve, for I am
above him. I am your master now. This is not your

00:38:11.663 --> 00:38:19.627
realm. Get back into the fire plane. Where you
came from.

00:38:19.627 --> 00:38:26.023
MATT: He looks back at the long snake-like
humanoid who's standing there who glances at the

00:38:26.023 --> 00:38:36.364
other one and goes, "She wants us back. Very
well." And they all turn around and begin to

00:38:36.364 --> 00:38:39.854
slowly drift back towards the center of the
Cindergrove where the flickering light was.

00:38:39.854 --> 00:38:41.104
MARISHA: Holy shit.

00:38:41.104 --> 00:38:42.594
LAURA: Good job, Keyleth!

00:38:42.594 --> 00:38:44.086
TRAVIS: We don't know what happened, why are we
clapping?

00:38:44.086 --> 00:38:46.044
LAURA: They're turning around, they're heading
back in that direction!

00:38:46.044 --> 00:38:51.578
MARISHA: I fly back over to them, still in fire
elemental form--

00:38:51.578 --> 00:38:53.093
LIAM: Whoa whoa whoa!

00:38:53.093 --> 00:38:55.290
MARISHA: And I'm like: You guys! Did you see that!
It was really crazy! Did you see? Did you see?

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:58.500
They think I'm their leader! They think I'm their
god!

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.052
TRAVIS: Is she talking in normal, or is she
talking in the (flickering flames).

00:39:01.052 --> 00:39:02.549
MATT: (flickering flames)

00:39:02.549 --> 00:39:04.141
TRAVIS: Yeah, no idea what you're doing or saying.

00:39:04.141 --> 00:39:05.403
LAURA: You're very scary right now, dear.

00:39:05.403 --> 00:39:06.611
CHRIS: Is she going to be sick?

00:39:06.611 --> 00:39:10.727
TRAVIS: I think so. I might have to tackle you if
you don't calm the fuck down.

00:39:10.727 --> 00:39:15.525
MARISHA: I chill out. I chill out, I can't revert
back, though, guys, because I want to stay in this.

00:39:15.525 --> 00:39:20.510
MATT: So the fire elemental is just like (calm
whoosh). And it's more of a smoldering sad

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:22.034
elemental at the moment.

00:39:22.034 --> 00:39:23.563
MARISHA: I give them a fire thumbs-up.

00:39:23.563 --> 00:39:25.771
MATT: There you go. Strong sad elemental.

00:39:25.771 --> 00:39:27.243
LIAM: First word. Two syllables.

00:39:27.243 --> 00:39:33.040
TRAVIS: So, they're going back. Do we move on?

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.333
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

00:39:34.333 --> 00:39:43.712
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm going to take off, leading in
my fire elemental form, deeper towards the rift.

00:39:43.712 --> 00:39:48.682
Keeping my eye out for any elementals that might
be escaping.

00:39:48.682 --> 00:39:50.099
MATT: All right.

00:39:50.099 --> 00:39:51.366
TALIESIN: This is her game.

00:39:51.366 --> 00:39:53.101
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it's on fire.

00:39:53.101 --> 00:39:59.316
MATT: Go ahead and make a sleight of hand check.

00:39:59.316 --> 00:40:01.935
LAURA: What?

00:40:01.935 --> 00:40:03.747
CHRIS: 18.

00:40:03.747 --> 00:40:08.789
MATT: Okay. Vex, make a perception check.

00:40:08.789 --> 00:40:11.446
TRAVIS: Roll high.

00:40:11.446 --> 00:40:13.711
LAURA: Pressure!

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:15.361
TALIESIN: Use one of your good dice.

00:40:15.361 --> 00:40:17.700
LAURA: Perception.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.078
LIAM: And roll bad.

00:40:19.078 --> 00:40:20.263
LAURA: Shut up.

00:40:20.263 --> 00:40:21.546
TALIESIN: Should've used the good dice.

00:40:21.546 --> 00:40:23.089
LAURA: 30. No. 28.

00:40:23.089 --> 00:40:24.447
MATT: 28?

00:40:24.447 --> 00:40:27.531
SAM: Yep! Wait, are you exhausted?

00:40:27.531 --> 00:40:29.559
MATT: Yeah, you are.

00:40:29.559 --> 00:40:30.752
LAURA: On everything?

00:40:30.752 --> 00:40:32.200
MATT: Skill check. Roll again.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.904
LAURA: No, even better!

00:40:33.904 --> 00:40:35.114
TRAVIS: Even better.

00:40:35.114 --> 00:40:36.213
LIAM: So it's the earlier.

00:40:36.213 --> 00:40:39.678
MATT: So it's the earlier one, yeah. Okay. You
just see, as you're all just walking along, your

00:40:39.678 --> 00:40:44.547
new blue dragonborn friend just reaches down and
snatches something from the dirt, pockets it and

00:40:44.547 --> 00:40:45.998
keeps walking.

00:40:45.998 --> 00:40:51.020
LAURA: I follow behind him and keep watching him.
Can I see what it was?

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:55.361
MATT: You have no idea. You just see a little
cluster of ash and dust on the ground that's been

00:40:55.361 --> 00:41:03.572
partially disturbed. All right. As you continue to
press forward, you hear in the distance a loud

00:41:03.572 --> 00:41:07.495
cracking sound echoing, and you can see what
appear to be a number of trees in the far-off side

00:41:07.495 --> 00:41:15.897
to the northeastern side of the forest, as a brief
whirlwind flickers up. You assume this is probably

00:41:15.897 --> 00:41:19.706
from the Fire Ashari, who've taken that side of
the entranceway, and you can see two flickering

00:41:19.706 --> 00:41:23.747
lights drift up in the air before sparking out in
the distance.

00:41:23.747 --> 00:41:25.009
TRAVIS: Ooh, really?

00:41:25.009 --> 00:41:27.050
LAURA: Should we let them know we're in place,
then?

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:31.819
MARISHA: I'll throw up a Skywrite. Or actually, as
a fire elemental, can I just be like (fire flares)

00:41:31.819 --> 00:41:33.514
in fire elemental form?

00:41:33.514 --> 00:41:36.487
MATT: I mean, you can make some localized fire
happen.

00:41:36.487 --> 00:41:39.646
MARISHA: Can I send up a little bit like a flare?

00:41:39.646 --> 00:41:43.591
MATT: Not in the way you would want to, you'd have
to drop form for that and cast a spell.

00:41:43.591 --> 00:41:44.557
MARISHA: Fuck.

00:41:44.557 --> 00:41:49.302
LAURA: I'm going to set an arrow on fire and shoot
it up in the air.

00:41:49.302 --> 00:41:51.704
MARISHA: I don't realize she's doing it.

00:41:51.704 --> 00:41:56.482
MATT: Okay. As you go ahead and take the arrow--
What do you have around the edge that are going

00:41:56.482 --> 00:41:58.206
to-- are you just going to light the shaft on
fire?

00:41:58.206 --> 00:42:03.242
LAURA: No, I'm going to tie some of my cloth
from-- you know-- that I have-- The thing.

00:42:03.242 --> 00:42:04.207
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:42:04.207 --> 00:42:08.503
LAURA: I take some cloth from the Bag of Holding,
from one of those old fancy cloaks that we have.

00:42:08.503 --> 00:42:10.671
TRAVIS: Better ask first.

00:42:10.671 --> 00:42:14.902
LAURA: (sighs) Seriously?! Can I have some of the
fancy cloak? Grog, out of the Bag of Holding, please?

00:42:14.902 --> 00:42:16.497
TRAVIS: Oh, are you hot right now? It's so weird.

00:42:16.497 --> 00:42:17.833
LAURA: Jesus Christ. Please.

00:42:17.833 --> 00:42:18.976
TRAVIS: Oh, all right. Fancy cloak.

00:42:18.976 --> 00:42:28.432
MATT: There you go. The arrow arcs off. Vanishes
across the little bit of the remaining treeline.

00:42:28.432 --> 00:42:29.920
LAURA: No idea if they saw that.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.202
MATT: All right. Do you guys continue to press
forward?

00:42:32.202 --> 00:42:36.041
MARISHA: Hold for a second. And wait for Team
Three's response?

00:42:36.041 --> 00:42:37.752
SAM: There's a third team?

00:42:37.752 --> 00:42:39.401
MARISHA: Right, there's a third team. Three teams,
right?

00:42:39.401 --> 00:42:41.434
LAURA: All the other teams already responded. We
were the third.

00:42:41.434 --> 00:42:44.248
MARISHA: Oh! One, two, we were three. Okay, yeah.

00:42:44.248 --> 00:42:50.785
MATT: Okay. You begin to push further forward
towards the center of the Cindergrove, as you're

00:42:50.785 --> 00:42:56.699
noticing more and more of these trees are pushed
flat. It's almost like that Russian forest the

00:42:56.699 --> 00:42:59.535
meteor had landed in and exploded; all the trees
are flattened--

00:42:59.535 --> 00:43:00.712
CHRIS: Tunguska.

00:43:00.712 --> 00:43:06.731
MATT: Think Tunguska, thank you. Where you begin
to climb over a number of these flattened portions

00:43:06.731 --> 00:43:12.691
of the forest, and in the center you can see that
one river of molten rock that had been trickling

00:43:12.691 --> 00:43:17.476
down the front of the mountain is sourced here in
the center, where once previously you guys had

00:43:17.476 --> 00:43:22.370
performed a ritual to pass into the elemental
plane, has now torn into this extremely bright rift

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:25.736
that flickers. It's like looking into the sun, you
have to avert your gaze; you cannot look directly

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:30.983
at it without actually hurting your eyesight. And
you can see, there are multiple paths of this

00:43:30.983 --> 00:43:37.422
molten lava, pouring out from this new volcanic
activity. You can see it burbling up and bubbling

00:43:37.422 --> 00:43:43.135
underneath, like the very presence of this tear
itself is causing the activity to just raise and

00:43:43.135 --> 00:43:50.299
grow more fervent. At the base of the rift, you
can see a number of other elemental creatures that

00:43:50.299 --> 00:43:53.419
are in the process of surrounding this opening--

00:43:53.419 --> 00:43:55.063
(door creak)

00:43:55.063 --> 00:43:57.879
MATT: -- and you can-- Everything all right, Ryan?

00:43:57.879 --> 00:44:00.179
RYAN: I am not here.

00:44:00.179 --> 00:44:01.885
MATT: You're not here, okay?

00:44:01.885 --> 00:44:03.554
SAM: You don't know.

00:44:03.554 --> 00:44:04.755
MATT: I don't know.

00:44:04.755 --> 00:44:06.874
CHRIS: You guys see him too?

00:44:06.874 --> 00:44:13.095
MATT: Perfect. As you can see, all these elemental
entities are swirling around. There are two more

00:44:13.095 --> 00:44:20.182
of these strange, snake-like humans, these
salamander-like creatures that are discussing, and

00:44:20.182 --> 00:44:24.813
one really large one that stands there holding
this strange trident-like structure, and it's

00:44:24.813 --> 00:44:30.775
shouting out commands left and right, and you can
see these salamander entities and a number of

00:44:30.775 --> 00:44:36.798
these elementals are all gathered around the
portal, and they're all just focusing this slow,

00:44:36.798 --> 00:44:41.494
steady beam towards it. And as you can see it
tearing, flickering and slowly expanding with each

00:44:41.494 --> 00:44:46.919
popping expansion of this doorway, the ground
itself shifts and rumbles.

00:44:46.919 --> 00:44:48.352
LAURA: I Hunter's Mark the big one.

00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:49.336
MATT: All right.

00:44:49.336 --> 00:44:52.777
CHRIS: Can I send a candle?

00:44:52.777 --> 00:44:54.761
MATT: If you'd like to, yeah.

00:44:54.761 --> 00:44:59.109
CHRIS: All right, what am I looking at, here?
Fire? There's a bit of fire?

00:44:59.109 --> 00:45:05.423
MATT: There's a lot of fire. Most of these
entities are either fire essence or just made out

00:45:05.423 --> 00:45:06.704
of straight flame.

00:45:06.704 --> 00:45:13.198
CHRIS: I'd like to call over the skeleton known as
Fatty Arbuckle. I'd like to give Fatty Arbuckle an

00:45:13.198 --> 00:45:16.064
Ice Storm Candle.

00:45:16.064 --> 00:45:17.703
MATT: All right.

00:45:17.703 --> 00:45:24.793
CHRIS: And ask him to kindly deliver it to the
center of this melee that's happening just up

00:45:24.793 --> 00:45:25.493
ahead.

00:45:25.493 --> 00:45:27.311
SAM: Won't that kill your friend?

00:45:27.311 --> 00:45:29.841
CHRIS: Oh. He's had a good run.

00:45:29.841 --> 00:45:34.714
TALIESIN: I'm feeling a lot less guilty,
suddenly.

00:45:34.714 --> 00:45:38.541
CHRIS: Well, I can do it! What I don't appreciate
is when other people do it.

00:45:38.541 --> 00:45:39.670
SAM: That's fair. That's fair.

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:44.535
CHRIS: You know, it's my choice. Never said it was
okay for you to start lighting them up with

00:45:44.535 --> 00:45:48.573
arrows. Jesus Christ, whoever that is.

00:45:48.573 --> 00:45:53.480
LAURA: I'm Vex'ahlia, nice to meet you.

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:59.648
MATT: Fatty Arbuckle, skeletal claws clasped
around the side of this marbled-looking,

00:45:59.648 --> 00:46:05.691
bluish-white candle, and clutches it and just goes
(snarl).

00:46:05.691 --> 00:46:11.209
CHRIS: Yes, off you trot, go!

00:46:11.209 --> 00:46:13.082
SAM: You don't have to demean him as he goes.

00:46:13.082 --> 00:46:17.896
TALIESIN: I was really hoping for a Fatty Arbuckle
skeleton impression. I was really, really hoping

00:46:17.896 --> 00:46:20.279
for it. What you did was cool, but like, that was
just my heart.

00:46:20.279 --> 00:46:25.020
CHRIS: They can't speak. They don't have voice
boxes or anything.

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:29.548
MATT: As it shuffles forward, down this ashen pit
towards the dome where the lava itself is

00:46:29.548 --> 00:46:36.545
beginning to pour forth and the doorway is, you
can see the shadow of its form as the light

00:46:36.545 --> 00:46:41.319
passes. It looks like the cover of The Thing, how
it's just bright light coursing past this dark

00:46:41.319 --> 00:46:44.381
image of the skeleton, walking away from you.

00:46:44.381 --> 00:46:47.824
LAURA: Maybe we should duck down, so that nobody
knows where that came from.

00:46:47.824 --> 00:46:49.838
CHRIS: Oh, yes, get ten feet back, I should've
said that already.

00:46:49.838 --> 00:46:56.336
MATT: It's walked quite a distance, thankfully, at
this point. It's probably a good 40 or 50 feet

00:46:56.336 --> 00:47:02.200
before it reaches the first salamander. And you
see, as it begins to step forward, they all turn

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:09.157
and look, and one of them shouts over (snarling).
One of them glances over, reaches out and pulls

00:47:09.157 --> 00:47:16.338
out a long, brass-colored longbow and begins to
notch an arrow carefully, as it hobbles forward.

00:47:16.338 --> 00:47:22.900
They look at each other. One of them shouts out in
Ignan, which you understand, Keyleth, shouting,

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:32.684
"You! Who walks here?" Just keeps walking forward
like a little wind-up toy made of bone. Until

00:47:32.684 --> 00:47:41.515
eventually, the one with the bow gives a nudge
with its head, and the other salamander entity

00:47:41.515 --> 00:47:47.502
draws a heavy-bladed object and begins to step
forward towards it, ready to go ahead and cleave

00:47:47.502 --> 00:47:54.337
it. As the skeleton steps forward, it gets right
at the corner of its range. Do you want to command it?

00:47:54.337 --> 00:47:56.681
MARISHA: I feel like Helen Hunt in that moment in
Twister.

00:47:56.681 --> 00:47:58.851
CHRIS: Squeeze the candle, Fatty Arbuckle!

00:47:58.851 --> 00:48:06.321
MATT: At which point, the skeleton, just as the
blade sweeps past and crashes into its torso,

00:48:06.321 --> 00:48:12.806
shattering the rib cage, the arms go (crack). The
wax bends and cracks in the center, and there's a

00:48:12.806 --> 00:48:23.644
brief pause where nothing seems to happen. And a
swirl of sudden, localized storming blizzard just

00:48:23.644 --> 00:48:29.462
encases a ten-foot radius, hitting both of those
salamander creatures. What does it say on the

00:48:29.462 --> 00:48:31.024
candle specifically?

00:48:31.024 --> 00:48:40.650
CHRIS: On the Ice Storm Candle. All affected must
make a dexterity saving throw, DC 12, or suffer

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:42.736
4d6 cold damage.

00:48:42.736 --> 00:48:46.680
MATT: That's a fail and a save. And it's half
damage on success?

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.075
CHRIS: Half damage on success.

00:48:48.075 --> 00:48:51.267
MATT: Great. Okay, so one of them failed and one
of them saved. So go ahead and roll 4d6 damage.

00:48:51.267 --> 00:48:54.510
TRAVIS: Dang. I think that's a good way to start.

00:48:54.510 --> 00:49:02.033
CHRIS: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Oh boy.
Three, six, nine.

00:49:02.033 --> 00:49:08.971
MATT: Nine? Okay, nine and five cold damage to each.
So (bang) it blasts open. Oh, and a dexterity

00:49:08.971 --> 00:49:15.964
check for your buddy, who makes it! So, Fatty
Arbuckle actually walks out of there with a mere

00:49:15.964 --> 00:49:18.248
five points of cold damage.

00:49:18.248 --> 00:49:19.379
LAURA: Nice, Fatty!

00:49:19.379 --> 00:49:22.915
MATT: Out of ice and frost. His busted-open rib
cage, though, he did suffer...

00:49:22.915 --> 00:49:24.867
LIAM: Super duper!

00:49:24.867 --> 00:49:29.431
TRAVIS: Putting on the Ritz!

00:49:29.431 --> 00:49:37.792
MATT: Did suffer seven damage from the impact of
this weapon. So Fatty Arbuckle, pretty damaged,

00:49:37.792 --> 00:49:41.232
but still standing there just going (snarling).

00:49:41.232 --> 00:49:45.403
CHRIS: Keep standing, Fatty, you can do it! I love
you, Fatty!

00:49:45.403 --> 00:49:47.746
MATT: Is everyone just going to sit back at this,
or--?

00:49:47.746 --> 00:49:49.384
LAURA: No, we should probably attack.

00:49:49.384 --> 00:49:52.731
MATT: It's up to you. Or you can watch this
horrible bludgeoning of this skeleton in the teeth

00:49:52.731 --> 00:49:53.610
of death.

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:58.291
TRAVIS: When I see the salamander take out the
big, shiny sharp thing, I go into a rage.

00:49:58.291 --> 00:49:59.426
LAURA: I hide.

00:49:59.426 --> 00:50:01.580
MATT: All right. Travis, I assume you're going to
be rushing in there, then?

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:02.439
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:50:02.439 --> 00:50:05.086
MATT: Anyone who wishes to immediately go into
battle now, let's roll initiative.

00:50:05.086 --> 00:50:06.246
TALIESIN: All right. I'm in on this.

00:50:06.246 --> 00:50:07.574
MATT: All right. Let me go ahead and--

00:50:07.574 --> 00:50:08.831
SAM: For Fatty!

00:50:08.831 --> 00:50:14.273
MARISHA: So these are all fire elementals. Should
I continue--

00:50:14.273 --> 00:50:16.759
TALIESIN: Oh, hell yeah.

00:50:16.759 --> 00:50:17.683
CHRIS: Ah, nice.

00:50:17.683 --> 00:50:21.357
LAURA: Should we roll for stealth again, or are we
still stealthed?

00:50:21.357 --> 00:50:26.862
CHRIS: I was just shouting at a skeleton.

00:50:26.862 --> 00:50:30.072
LAURA: Oh, I know, I was trying to hide, though.
Like, back away from you as you were doing that.

00:50:30.072 --> 00:50:33.369
TRAVIS: The candle turned into a blizzard, so.
Ooh!

00:50:33.369 --> 00:50:36.128
TALIESIN: Is it a candle, though? It's like a
thing, like there's no--

00:50:36.128 --> 00:50:39.924
LIAM: And I mean, Gern was shouting.

00:50:39.924 --> 00:50:42.979
TALIESIN: It's a candle the way the wheelie things
are hoverboards. I think it's weird.

00:50:42.979 --> 00:50:46.514
CHRIS: And they also catch on fire. They also
explode.

00:50:46.514 --> 00:50:52.670
MATT: All right, so this is quite a ways away from
the portal itself. Lava flow traveling around that side.

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:57.198
TALIESIN: Oh, look at that!

00:50:57.198 --> 00:50:59.673
MATT: All right, and we have Keyleth over here as
the fire elemental.

00:50:59.673 --> 00:51:00.922
LAURA: You're at the portal.

00:51:00.922 --> 00:51:01.981
MARISHA: Huh?

00:51:01.981 --> 00:51:04.891
LAURA: That's okay. We're all going to die.

00:51:04.891 --> 00:51:06.472
TRAVIS: No.

00:51:06.472 --> 00:51:07.702
TALIESIN: Where's the big one?

00:51:07.702 --> 00:51:09.872
MATT: The big one that you haven't seen yet?

00:51:09.872 --> 00:51:12.321
LAURA: The big one that I Hunter's Marked.

00:51:12.321 --> 00:51:15.319
TALIESIN: That one. The one holding the tridenty
thing.

00:51:15.319 --> 00:51:16.776
MATT: Oh, sorry.

00:51:16.776 --> 00:51:18.301
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:51:18.301 --> 00:51:24.499
LAURA: Whoa. Look at how pretty those lava bubbles
look!

00:51:24.499 --> 00:51:26.323
SAM: Is that Gern?

00:51:26.323 --> 00:51:28.560
MATT: That's Gern right there.

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.283
We have Fatty Arbuckle.

00:51:30.283 --> 00:51:32.820
TALIESIN: Fatty!

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:38.766
MATT: And chilling over here, we have Coral and
Stimpy.

00:51:38.766 --> 00:51:43.171
TRAVIS: What is that crater? Is that just a
crater?

00:51:43.171 --> 00:51:45.737
LIAM: I think that's the portal they were trying
to--

00:51:45.737 --> 00:51:53.109
SAM: So these are fire elementals, yes?

00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:56.333
MATT: They seem to be fire-based creatures, yes.

00:51:56.333 --> 00:51:57.409
LIAM: Hey, DM!

00:51:57.409 --> 00:51:58.234
MATT: Yes.

00:51:58.234 --> 00:51:59.980
LIAM: You said they were ripping open the portal?
Where is that on the map?

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:02.745
MATT: It's back, it's this far back.

00:52:02.745 --> 00:52:04.831
LIAM: Way back, okay.

00:52:04.831 --> 00:52:06.435
TRAVIS: That crater's just a crater, though?

00:52:06.435 --> 00:52:11.059
MATT: Yeah. There is a pool of magma that goes
this way. You guys are on one side of it, and

00:52:11.059 --> 00:52:16.395
pushing this way further, the rest of the actual
portal's back this far. All right. So, initiative

00:52:16.395 --> 00:52:19.331
order, we have 25 to 20, anyone?

00:52:19.331 --> 00:52:20.222
SAM: 22.

00:52:20.222 --> 00:52:21.466
TALIESIN: 27.

00:52:21.466 --> 00:52:26.021
TRAVIS: Fucking Percy. Jesus. Every time. You
motherfucker.

00:52:26.021 --> 00:52:28.360
TALIESIN: I'm fast as fuck.

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:34.999
MATT: Okay. 20 to 15.

00:52:34.999 --> 00:52:36.755
TRAVIS: 17.

00:52:36.755 --> 00:52:39.301
CHRIS: 19.

00:52:39.301 --> 00:52:43.482
LIAM: 16. Carl!

00:52:43.482 --> 00:52:49.354
MATT: All right.

00:52:49.354 --> 00:52:51.128
LAURA: 13.

00:52:51.128 --> 00:52:56.119
MATT: 13. Keyleth?

00:52:56.119 --> 00:52:58.805
MARISHA: Four.

00:52:58.805 --> 00:53:02.739
MATT: All right, great. So, top of the round,
Percy, you're up first.

00:53:02.739 --> 00:53:11.816
TALIESIN: First thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to use my pistol. I'm going to do a trick shot for

00:53:11.816 --> 00:53:17.884
the arms. Actually, the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to use my bonus action to-- you

00:53:17.884 --> 00:53:26.123
know, actually, I'm going to hold off on that. I'm
going to make an arm shot to the

00:53:26.123 --> 00:53:27.459
one with the trident.

00:53:27.459 --> 00:53:28.726
MATT: All righty.

00:53:28.726 --> 00:53:39.474
TALIESIN: That was my first shot. And that's 25.

00:53:39.529 --> 00:53:41.181
MATT: 25 hits.

00:53:41.181 --> 00:53:46.286
TALIESIN: And that's a strength saving throw.

00:53:46.286 --> 00:53:50.965
MATT: Strength saving throw. That is going to be a
20.

00:53:50.965 --> 00:53:52.383
TALIESIN: That just barely makes it.

00:53:52.383 --> 00:53:57.055
MATT: Aw. The blast of your impact (bang) hits the
arm. He manages to hold onto his

00:53:57.055 --> 00:53:58.660
trident-like weapon.

00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:02.590
TALIESIN: That's fine. He's going to take his
damage, and then he's going to take another one of

00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:04.051
those, because eff that.

00:54:04.051 --> 00:54:05.601
MATT: All righty. So go ahead and roll damage on
that.

00:54:05.601 --> 00:54:07.104
TRAVIS: Because eff that.

00:54:07.104 --> 00:54:12.623
TALIESIN: That's 13 points of damage.

00:54:12.623 --> 00:54:15.086
MATT: 13 points of damage. All righty.

00:54:15.086 --> 00:54:16.630
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to take another
shot.

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:20.354
MATT: Go for it. Scanlan, you're up on deck, by
the way, so be ready.

00:54:20.354 --> 00:54:21.370
TALIESIN: 20.

00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:22.561
MATT: 20 hits.

00:54:22.561 --> 00:54:24.715
TALIESIN: Strength check.

00:54:24.715 --> 00:54:26.566
MATT: That's a nine.

00:54:26.566 --> 00:54:28.212
TALIESIN: He dropped that.

00:54:28.212 --> 00:54:31.990
MATT: Failure. (gunshot) You see his fingers are
pried off as one of his pinky fingers is actually

00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:37.833
blown off from the impact, shooting dark, deep
crimson blood that seems to burn the landscape

00:54:37.833 --> 00:54:42.887
around as it drips, the trident tumbling to the
ground and getting lodged in a piece of rock,

00:54:42.887 --> 00:54:44.876
almost ready to spill into part of the lava.

00:54:44.876 --> 00:54:47.864
TALIESIN: And that does seven points of damage.

00:54:47.864 --> 00:54:49.392
MATT: Seven points of damage, all righty.

00:54:49.392 --> 00:54:51.031
TALIESIN: Third shot's going to be a sharpshooter
shot.

00:54:51.031 --> 00:54:52.659
MATT: All righty. So minus five to the attack.

00:54:52.659 --> 00:55:01.168
TALIESIN: That's probably going to miss. 14.

00:55:01.168 --> 00:55:03.268
MATT: 14, unfortunately, misses.

00:55:03.268 --> 00:55:07.641
TALIESIN: All right. That misses. I'm going to
take a run behind and hide behind that rock

00:55:07.641 --> 00:55:09.373
outcropping.

00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:12.485
MATT: There? Okay. Got it. Scanlan, you're up.

00:55:12.485 --> 00:55:15.669
SAM: Do I see that big thing in the back?

00:55:15.669 --> 00:55:19.501
MATT: This big thing here? Yeah, the fire
elemental. You see that.

00:55:19.501 --> 00:55:24.706
SAM: Okay. And the thing next to Fatty Arbuckle is
also a baddie, yeah? They're all baddies?

00:55:24.706 --> 00:55:26.207
MATT: These things are all baddies here.

00:55:26.207 --> 00:55:34.852
SAM: All right. I'm going to take 15 feet, step to
my right to put me in a straight line with the guy

00:55:34.852 --> 00:55:43.376
next to Fatty and the big guy behind him. And then
fire a Lightning Bolt straight ahead to hit both

00:55:43.376 --> 00:55:47.179
of them. I hope they're not immune to lightning.
We'll find out.

00:55:47.179 --> 00:55:52.467
MATT: All righty. So, and you watch out of the
corner as well, Gern, you see this tiny little

00:55:52.467 --> 00:55:59.046
gnome step to the side, conjure some arcane
purplish-blue energy, and then thrust his pelvis

00:55:59.046 --> 00:56:02.277
forward as a bolt of lightning energy just
rockets forth, tearing--

00:56:02.277 --> 00:56:03.407
SAM: From my penis.

00:56:03.407 --> 00:56:04.767
CHRIS: Nice. Of course.

00:56:04.767 --> 00:56:07.367
SAM: Just felt like I had to make that clear.

00:56:07.367 --> 00:56:12.688
CHRIS: Oh, I don't think I've ever seen that
happen before.

00:56:12.688 --> 00:56:13.847
TALIESIN: We have.

00:56:13.847 --> 00:56:14.867
LAURA: So many times.

00:56:14.867 --> 00:56:16.038
CHRIS: Have to get that looked at.

00:56:16.038 --> 00:56:17.725
MATT: Slamming both into the larger salamander
creature and the elemental behind it. Go ahead and

00:56:17.725 --> 00:56:21.201
roll 8d6 damage. What's the DC on this?

00:56:21.201 --> 00:56:22.684
SAM: Is it my spell save DC?

00:56:22.684 --> 00:56:23.602
MATT: Yes.

00:56:23.602 --> 00:56:24.891
SAM: With the hand-cone?

00:56:24.891 --> 00:56:25.812
MATT: Yeah.

00:56:25.812 --> 00:56:26.700
SAM: 20.

00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:30.738
MATT: Ooh! That is a failure and a failure!

00:56:30.738 --> 00:56:32.925
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:56:32.925 --> 00:56:34.616
MATT: All right. So full damage against both.

00:56:34.616 --> 00:56:35.754
SAM: 27.

00:56:35.754 --> 00:56:45.170
MATT: Oof. All righty. As the bolt of lightning
energy tears through both of them, eventually

00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:50.438
absorbed into the stone behind them, the elemental
flame form flickers and falls to the ground for a

00:56:50.438 --> 00:56:54.907
second, trying to reform itself, while the
salamander looks down at this blackened, burned

00:56:54.907 --> 00:56:58.705
char mark in the center of its torso from where
the bolt entered and exited out of its back to

00:56:58.705 --> 00:57:02.471
strike its compadre. Not too happy, and confused
how such a large, damaging thing came from such a

00:57:02.471 --> 00:57:05.205
small little creature.

00:57:05.205 --> 00:57:14.023
SAM: It's powerful. Then I'll turn to our new
friend Gern, and I will inspire him. I'll say,

00:57:14.023 --> 00:57:20.679
please, help us, and to inspire you I will sing
you a song. And I will sing--

00:57:20.718 --> 00:57:22.924
CHRIS: Pretty inspired by your dick lightning, to
be honest.

00:57:22.924 --> 00:57:23.977
SAM: Oh, there's more.

00:57:23.977 --> 00:57:25.252
CHRIS: You think a song's going to get better than
that?

00:57:25.252 --> 00:57:32.289
SAM: It might! It might. And so I sing (singing):
To everything, Gern, Gern, Gern. There is a

00:57:32.289 --> 00:57:42.707
season, Gern, Gern, Gern. I just like to sing your
name, Gern Blanston. Did that help?

00:57:42.707 --> 00:57:47.237
CHRIS: Do I have to roll to determine if that was
helpful or not?

00:57:47.237 --> 00:57:48.576
MATT: If you'd like to.

00:57:48.576 --> 00:57:49.495
CHRIS: Certainly.

00:57:49.495 --> 00:57:53.176
MATT: Roll a d20 for musical taste.

00:57:53.176 --> 00:57:56.359
CHRIS: Four.

00:57:56.359 --> 00:57:59.485
MATT: Four. It catches you by the ear with
delight.

00:57:59.485 --> 00:58:02.912
CHRIS: It's not bad, actually. It's not bad.

00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:07.099
MATT: Your general frustration with modern music
is completely bisected by the more oldies,

00:58:07.099 --> 00:58:08.846
classical sound of his tune.

00:58:08.846 --> 00:58:13.203
CHRIS: I quite enjoyed how you worked my first
name into that, actually.

00:58:13.203 --> 00:58:17.341
No one's ever done that before.

00:58:17.341 --> 00:58:19.181
MATT: So you get a d10 inspiration dice.

00:58:19.181 --> 00:58:19.994
CHRIS: All right.

00:58:19.994 --> 00:58:24.557
MATT: So just keep that on the side. If ever you
make an attack roll or a saving throw that isn't

00:58:24.557 --> 00:58:28.490
as high as you want it to be, you can then roll
that and add the d10 to that roll.

00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:29.536
CHRIS: Okay, great.

00:58:29.536 --> 00:58:31.631
MATT: So you just have that in the wings, as you
feel inspired.

00:58:31.631 --> 00:58:33.037
TALIESIN: We'll try and remind you if something
affects it.

00:58:33.037 --> 00:58:34.440
CHRIS: Thank you very much. Excellent.

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:39.746
MATT: All right. That brings it to the elementals'
turn. Now, this flame elemental is going to streak

00:58:39.746 --> 00:58:49.422
over (whoosh) to Blern who's-- or, no, sorry, this
is to Fatty Arbuckle. There's too many weird names

00:58:49.422 --> 00:58:52.683
tonight. And this larger fire elemental here is
going to--

00:58:52.683 --> 00:58:58.956
CHRIS: Oh, Fatty. He served me well.

00:58:58.956 --> 00:59:04.556
SAM: I don't know, he's got a fighting chance. I
love that we were scrambling for d6's when we have

00:59:04.556 --> 00:59:07.827
this right in front of us.

00:59:07.827 --> 00:59:09.536
CHRIS: Are there any dice around anywhere?

00:59:09.536 --> 00:59:11.041
SAM: Where are we going to find...?

00:59:11.041 --> 00:59:12.938
TALIESIN: I'm just waiting for the hand to go in
and just--

00:59:12.938 --> 00:59:16.478
CHRIS: I found this polyhedral vase and I had to
fill it with nine pounds of dice.

00:59:16.478 --> 00:59:18.945
TRAVIS: He went the long way.

00:59:18.945 --> 00:59:20.689
MATT: He's not doing anything, he used his whole
round to get there.

00:59:20.689 --> 00:59:21.926
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

00:59:21.926 --> 00:59:27.356
MATT: But now, as the larger elemental burns into
the center of Scanlan, Percy, you can feel, just

00:59:27.356 --> 00:59:33.275
his presence itself is extremely, dangerously hot.
The air around you is blistering. You can feel

00:59:33.275 --> 00:59:38.586
your hair curl back in its presence. The small
elemental is going to go ahead and make two

00:59:38.586 --> 00:59:40.751
attacks against Fatty Arbuckle.

00:59:40.751 --> 00:59:43.234
CHRIS: Ah, shite.

00:59:43.234 --> 00:59:50.386
MATT: That's going to be a nine to hit. I think
his AC's 13, so I don't think it's going to hit,

00:59:50.386 --> 00:59:52.305
yeah. Second one rolls a one.

00:59:52.305 --> 00:59:53.528
SAM: Fatty lives!

00:59:53.528 --> 00:59:55.867
TRAVIS: Fatty just don't want to die.

00:59:55.867 --> 00:59:57.508
TALIESIN: Can't keep Fatty down.

00:59:57.508 --> 00:59:59.657
LIAM: Bob and weave, Fatty, bob and weave!

00:59:59.657 --> 01:00:09.383
CHRIS: Don't step too hard, Fatty! You
won't be able to take it!

01:00:09.383 --> 01:00:14.488
MATT: And with that, Grog, it's your turn. So you
go into your rage at the top of your turn, and

01:00:14.488 --> 01:00:15.776
then what would you like to do?

01:00:15.776 --> 01:00:19.651
TRAVIS: Can I use, I guess, my entire action to
run towards Scanlan?

01:00:19.651 --> 01:00:21.453
MATT: What's your speed again?

01:00:21.453 --> 01:00:22.487
TRAVIS: 50.

01:00:22.487 --> 01:00:27.993
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. You can
get right there between Scanlan and this creature

01:00:27.993 --> 01:00:29.326
if you want to.

01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:30.546
TRAVIS: That's about it, huh?

01:00:30.546 --> 01:00:33.188
MATT: I'd say that's your movement. You can move
ten more feet if you want to.

01:00:33.188 --> 01:00:34.518
SAM: You can leap over me.

01:00:34.518 --> 01:00:38.054
TRAVIS: Nah, we need to spread out. Can I go back
and arc the other way? Can I run to the left as

01:00:38.054 --> 01:00:39.273
far as I can?

01:00:39.273 --> 01:00:40.056
MATT: This way?

01:00:40.056 --> 01:00:41.536
TRAVIS: No, from where my starting point was.

01:00:41.536 --> 01:00:42.562
MATT: Oh, you mean like this way instead?

01:00:42.562 --> 01:00:44.421
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah, back towards you, around the
pool.

01:00:44.479 --> 01:00:50.595
MATT: That's about as far as you can get, right
there. If you do not attack anything, you would

01:00:50.595 --> 01:00:51.822
lose your rage.

01:00:51.822 --> 01:00:56.629
TRAVIS: I fall out of my rage, yeah. So I fall out
of it. Can I throw something? I guess I can, yeah.

01:00:56.629 --> 01:00:58.116
MATT: You can throw your weapon if you want to.

01:00:58.116 --> 01:01:04.917
TRAVIS: Can I attach the Chain of Returning to
Craven Edge? And I'll throw it at trident-less

01:01:04.917 --> 01:01:06.758
bastard right there, yeah.

01:01:06.758 --> 01:01:11.898
MATT: Go for it. So you watch as this muscle-bound
goliath comes leaping around the corner as it

01:01:11.898 --> 01:01:15.431
affixes a chain to the edge of its weapon,
flinging a two-handed sword like a giant boomerang and--

01:01:15.431 --> 01:01:17.377
TRAVIS: Only 14.

01:01:17.377 --> 01:01:21.126
MATT: 14, against the larger one?

01:01:21.126 --> 01:01:22.051
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:01:22.051 --> 01:01:26.724
MATT: Unfortunately, it makes an impact, but it
just ricochets off of its plated body armor, and

01:01:26.724 --> 01:01:30.134
then tumbles to the ground. You can go ahead and
make your--

01:01:30.134 --> 01:01:35.086
TRAVIS: Thing to pull it back. Strength. 18.

01:01:35.086 --> 01:01:39.667
MATT: Okay, no problem. You pull it back with the
chain and catch it mid-air. Ending your turn there?

01:01:39.667 --> 01:01:41.010
TRAVIS: Keeping my rage.

01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:42.583
MATT: Indeed. Vax, you're up.

01:01:42.583 --> 01:01:49.247
LIAM: All right, so I rev up the Boots of Haste
and I'm going to run right next to Vex'ahlia, on

01:01:49.247 --> 01:01:53.366
the very edge of the map. And the fire elemental
there's right up against Percy, right?

01:01:53.366 --> 01:01:54.381
MATT: Yep.

01:01:54.381 --> 01:02:04.948
LIAM: All right. I'm going to stab him three times
in his fire buttocks. First one is a 27.

01:02:04.948 --> 01:02:07.274
MATT: That hits.

01:02:07.274 --> 01:02:09.005
LIAM: Second one is a 16.

01:02:09.005 --> 01:02:10.152
MATT: Hits.

01:02:10.152 --> 01:02:11.631
LIAM: Third is a 14.

01:02:11.631 --> 01:02:12.487
MATT: Hits.

01:02:12.487 --> 01:02:23.165
LIAM: Hits, okay. So, first one's sneak attack,
so, shite. An eight-- I'll add that on at the end.

01:02:23.165 --> 01:02:36.013
Here come the dice. Two, four, seven, ten, 16, 21,
27, 28. 28 plus two is 30, 36, for that first with

01:02:36.013 --> 01:02:37.223
sneak attack damage.

01:02:37.223 --> 01:02:41.462
MATT: Oof! His form flickers briefly for a moment
from the sheer impact of the dagger hit.

01:02:41.462 --> 01:02:48.287
LIAM: Second dagger does seven, and third swipe
does nine.

01:02:48.287 --> 01:02:52.174
MATT: Nine. All righty. The two other daggers
impact, partially passing through its form, not

01:02:52.174 --> 01:02:56.466
quite as impactful as the first. That first one
did seemingly cause the creature to have a hard

01:02:56.466 --> 01:03:01.637
time coalescing its fire-wreathed physicality.
That ends your turn, Vax?

01:03:01.637 --> 01:03:02.742
LIAM: Yes.

01:03:02.742 --> 01:03:05.435
MATT: Gern, you're up. So you're right there.

01:03:05.435 --> 01:03:13.581
CHRIS: I'm right there. How far can I run and cast
a spell at the ones around Fatty?

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:16.648
MATT: 30 feet is how far you can run, and that's
about six squares.

01:03:16.648 --> 01:03:24.806
CHRIS: If I were to cast a bit of-- how about a
Cone of Cold, could I cast a Cone of Cold at the

01:03:24.806 --> 01:03:25.896
fire elementals?

01:03:25.896 --> 01:03:27.541
MATT: You could, you could very much so.

01:03:27.541 --> 01:03:29.248
LIAM: That sounds delightful.

01:03:29.248 --> 01:03:33.177
CHRIS: I could cast Ice Storm, but that's a
general malaise of middle-aged couples living in a

01:03:33.177 --> 01:03:36.699
neighborhood, becoming aware of their dead-end
lives.

01:03:36.699 --> 01:03:39.381
MATT: All right, so you want to move around here?

01:03:39.381 --> 01:03:44.635
CHRIS: Yes, let's move around that bit right
there. And I'd like to cast Cone of Cold. I might

01:03:44.635 --> 01:03:46.694
unfortunately have to take out Fatty, but--

01:03:46.694 --> 01:03:52.033
MATT: Yeah, there's probably a good chance, this
is not going to be-- After everything else Fatty's

01:03:52.033 --> 01:03:56.749
survived, his own master deals him the possible
finishing blow.

01:03:56.749 --> 01:03:58.752
CHRIS: I feel like I should be the one to do it.

01:03:58.752 --> 01:04:00.207
SAM: Of course.

01:04:00.207 --> 01:04:02.254
CHRIS: It's much more humane.

01:04:02.254 --> 01:04:03.402
SAM: It's poetic.

01:04:03.402 --> 01:04:04.542
CHRIS: I think so.

01:04:04.542 --> 01:04:06.013
MARISHA: You brought him into this world.

01:04:06.013 --> 01:04:07.843
CHRIS: This is what Fatty would've wanted.

01:04:07.843 --> 01:04:14.161
MATT: Everything under that area gets affected. So
yeah, you could do that.

01:04:14.161 --> 01:04:19.200
CHRIS: Yeah, don't worry about it. It's fine. No
big thing. This old spell? I mean.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.572
LIAM: Y'all want to go to the DQ and get a cone of
cold?

01:04:22.572 --> 01:04:27.306
MATT: What's your spell DC? It should be at the
top of your spell page.

01:04:27.306 --> 01:04:29.279
CHRIS: It is 16.

01:04:29.279 --> 01:04:33.147
MATT: 16, all right. And it is a constitution
save, let's see if they make it. That is a

01:04:33.147 --> 01:04:38.024
failure, a failure, and a failure.

01:04:38.024 --> 01:04:41.800
SAM: What about Fatty, did he succeed?

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:49.261
MATT: Oh, I'll roll for Fatty. Fatty does not
succeed. Nope.

01:04:49.261 --> 01:04:50.774
LAURA: It was inevitable.

01:04:50.774 --> 01:04:53.818
MATT: Nope. All right, go ahead and roll 8d8
points of cold damage.

01:04:53.818 --> 01:04:56.520
SAM: Jeez. Oh man, these are not used a lot.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:04.557
CHRIS: I have four. Let's see, I have a whole--
there's another one here... They're not that easy

01:05:04.557 --> 01:05:09.333
to get to. Two, four, six. I need two more.

01:05:09.333 --> 01:05:11.250
SAM: Two more? Good gravy.

01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:12.287
CHRIS: Is this one?

01:05:12.287 --> 01:05:13.250
SAM: Yep.

01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:15.559
CHRIS: Here's one, and... D'oh!

01:05:15.559 --> 01:05:19.649
LAURA: This is why I sort my dice at the beginning
of the game...

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:23.815
CHRIS: Sorry, it sounded like there was something
coming from the other side of the room.

01:05:23.815 --> 01:05:27.899
SAM: Taliesin, you don't have a d8?

01:05:27.899 --> 01:05:29.661
CHRIS: Do you have a d8 I can borrow?

01:05:29.661 --> 01:05:33.748
TALIESIN: I actually don't. I don't know what
happened to my d8's. I'll buy some at the

01:05:33.748 --> 01:05:35.158
convention tomorrow.

01:05:35.158 --> 01:05:36.555
LAURA: Yay!

01:05:36.555 --> 01:05:42.518
MATT: By the way, guys, if we hit 16k before the
end of tonight's show, we're going to go ahead and

01:05:42.518 --> 01:05:44.703
have a sloth come into the studio.

01:05:44.703 --> 01:05:45.985
LAURA: What?!

01:05:45.985 --> 01:05:47.620
MATT and MARISHA: 16K and a sloth!

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.184
MARISHA: I know! I know!

01:05:49.184 --> 01:05:50.272
LAURA: When? When?

01:05:50.272 --> 01:05:51.168
TRAVIS: What?

01:05:51.168 --> 01:05:52.085
SAM: An actual sloth?

01:05:52.085 --> 01:05:53.252
LIAM: Is it going to play with us?

01:05:53.252 --> 01:05:54.186
LAURA: Can we hold it?

01:05:54.186 --> 01:05:55.227
TRAVIS: Focus, focus.

01:05:55.227 --> 01:06:00.666
CHRIS: Seven, 14, 21, 27, 31, 34, 38, 44!

01:06:00.666 --> 01:06:02.066
ALL: Oh!

01:06:02.066 --> 01:06:04.637
MATT: 44, all...

01:06:04.637 --> 01:06:07.866
LAURA: (mocking Gern's accent) Farty-far pints o'
cald damage!

01:06:07.866 --> 01:06:12.957
CHRIS: I don't think I appreciate that very
fucking much! I'm saving all your fucking arses

01:06:12.957 --> 01:06:17.466
out here! For crumb's sake!

01:06:17.466 --> 01:06:28.414
MATT: As he's shouting out at you, releasing this
amazing, condensed blast of pure winter hell in

01:06:28.414 --> 01:06:33.356
front of him, it comes scattering across this way,
freezing the corner of this, turning partially

01:06:33.356 --> 01:06:39.548
some of the lava here to stone just by proximity,
blasts past these entities, and as the arcane snow

01:06:39.548 --> 01:06:45.948
comes to rest, you can see the fire elemental here
itself is having a hard time keeping itself

01:06:45.948 --> 01:06:49.668
together. Its flame is (whoosh) sputtering and
flickering, barely keeping itself together.

01:06:49.668 --> 01:06:57.613
However, by its side you see three very still
frozen-solid statuettes of the remnants of the two

01:06:57.613 --> 01:07:02.733
salamanders and Fatty Arbuckle. Taken by the cold
of winter.

01:07:02.733 --> 01:07:05.451
MARISHA: Oh, shit. That was awesome.

01:07:05.451 --> 01:07:07.176
SAM: Maybe you can reanimate him.

01:07:07.176 --> 01:07:10.707
CHRIS: It's too late. He's no good any longer.

01:07:10.707 --> 01:07:13.303
SAM: Freezer burn?

01:07:13.303 --> 01:07:14.805
CHRIS: Move on. I have.

01:07:14.805 --> 01:07:20.496
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of remembering
that, too, put a couple of:

01:07:20.496 --> 01:07:25.596
frozen, frozen, and frozen.

01:07:25.596 --> 01:07:27.951
CHRIS: (singing) Let it go, let it go.

01:07:27.951 --> 01:07:35.402
MATT: All right. I believe that ends your turn,
Gern? All right. It would be the salamanders'

01:07:35.402 --> 01:07:42.349
turn, but they're frozen. Damn, they got pummeled.
Vex, you're up.

01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:47.017
LAURA: Awesome. Wait, so they can unfreeze? Or are
they basically frozen until something--

01:07:47.017 --> 01:07:48.160
MATT: You don't know.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:54.371
LAURA: (groans) Okay. That yellow one behind me,
that's Keyleth, right?

01:07:54.371 --> 01:07:56.368
MATT: You believe so.

01:07:56.368 --> 01:08:01.415
LAURA: Okay. I know, right? I'm going to flip
backwards like ten feet.

01:08:01.415 --> 01:08:03.820
MATT: All right, right behind it.

01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:09.224
LAURA: I don't want to be around anybody else, so
I'm going to flip over the lava pit and go out there.

01:08:09.224 --> 01:08:11.595
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make an acrobatics
check.

01:08:11.595 --> 01:08:14.799
LIAM: Oh, don't burn your foot. Ooh!

01:08:14.799 --> 01:08:16.880
LAURA: That would be 38.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:24.582
MATT: Without issue, you land-- not even, no.
Two-point landing, on your feet, knee down, still

01:08:24.582 --> 01:08:30.405
clutching your ready-to-go bow, unscathed by the
boiling cauldron of molten rock.

01:08:30.405 --> 01:08:38.214
LAURA: And I Hunter's Mark the guy attacking near
Percy and Scanlan and I shoot two arrows into him.

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:43.315
MATT: Okay, right there. Go for it. Two attacks.

01:08:43.315 --> 01:08:53.683
LAURA: Ugh. Where is my thing? Hold on, sorry.
(giggles)

01:08:53.683 --> 01:08:56.911
MATT: You're on deck, Keyleth.

01:08:56.911 --> 01:08:57.950
LAURA: 21?

01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:59.249
MATT: 21 hits.

01:08:59.249 --> 01:09:00.791
LAURA: And 17.

01:09:00.791 --> 01:09:01.770
MATT: Both hit.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.889
TRAVIS: That's nice.

01:09:03.889 --> 01:09:12.239
LAURA: 17 on the first hit.

01:09:12.239 --> 01:09:13.856
MATT: All right.

01:09:13.856 --> 01:09:18.104
LAURA: And then 18 on the second hit.

01:09:18.104 --> 01:09:26.578
MATT: Nice! Both arrows burn to ash when they
impact, but the sheer blow and the magical energy

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:31.912
behind it from the bow that you threw it from hit
it and you can see it begin to shake its form even

01:09:31.912 --> 01:09:35.004
more, itself. Did you do the Hunter's Mark damage
as well?

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:35.921
LAURA: Yeah.

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:38.157
MATT: Okay, good. Cool. That end your turn, Vex?

01:09:38.157 --> 01:09:39.572
LAURA: Yes.

01:09:39.572 --> 01:09:40.677
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

01:09:40.677 --> 01:09:43.705
MARISHA: Okay. Work with me here.

01:09:43.705 --> 01:09:45.796
MATT: Okay. All right, whatcha got, whatcha
got?

01:09:45.796 --> 01:09:52.239
MARISHA: So here's what I want to do. I want to go
low and dive into that lava pit in front of me.

01:09:52.239 --> 01:09:54.535
SAM: Ooh! Sounds scary.

01:09:54.535 --> 01:10:03.285
MARISHA: And I want to-- using the lava around me
to rise out of the lava and look really scary and

01:10:03.285 --> 01:10:13.133
badass, and then I'm going to shout to the living
elementals, I'm going to be like, hear my warning!

01:10:13.133 --> 01:10:23.143
I am your new master! Retreat to the Fire Plane or
meet your imminent demise! This is your last chance.

01:10:23.143 --> 01:10:24.575
SAM: Pretty good. Pretty good.

01:10:24.575 --> 01:10:26.250
TALIESIN: Way better than last time.

01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:31.487
MARISHA: Thanks! Thanks, guys. And if you'd like
to meet for coffee later I might be available.

01:10:31.487 --> 01:10:37.919
MATT: I'll say, given the use of lava control in
this, they are still elementals, go ahead and

01:10:37.919 --> 01:10:41.151
make a persuasion check. No, intimidate, this
would be intimidate.

01:10:41.151 --> 01:10:45.554
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. That's better than my
persuasion. Let's do this one, that one rolled a

01:10:45.554 --> 01:10:50.380
one. Get out of here. Get out of here. 15?

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:59.277
MATT: 15? You can see the smaller elemental here
that just watched its friends get frozen solid, as

01:10:59.277 --> 01:11:06.554
well as whatever that skeleton was, turns towards
you, and (snarls) and begins to make

01:11:06.554 --> 01:11:08.278
its way this direction.

01:11:08.278 --> 01:11:10.150
MARISHA: Away? That's cool.

01:11:10.150 --> 01:11:11.501
TRAVIS: Towards the portal.

01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:14.310
MATT: Yeah. The large one doesn't seem prominently
fazed by your display.

01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:18.715
MARISHA: Okay. But that one's peacing out? Do I
still have an action?

01:11:18.715 --> 01:11:24.778
MATT: I would say that whole thing of bringing up
the molten rock and the shout and everything would

01:11:24.778 --> 01:11:26.179
be your action.

01:11:26.179 --> 01:11:27.985
TALIESIN: You knocked one off the plank, Keyleth.

01:11:27.985 --> 01:11:29.375
MARISHA: I knocked one off the plank.

01:11:29.375 --> 01:11:32.150
MATT: There you go. All right, ends your turn,
Keyleth, brings us to Percy.

01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:36.747
TALIESIN: I'm toe to toe with that one right
there, aren't I?

01:11:36.747 --> 01:11:37.995
MATT: Yeah, it's right up in your space.

01:11:37.995 --> 01:11:44.569
TALIESIN: It's in my space. Okay. I'm going to
draw my sword, I'm going to try to do a back and

01:11:44.569 --> 01:11:46.466
forth. Let's see how this goes.

01:11:46.466 --> 01:11:47.440
MATT: All right.

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:51.401
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a swipe at it with my
sword.

01:11:51.401 --> 01:11:53.029
MATT: Go for it.

01:11:53.029 --> 01:11:57.522
TALIESIN: That's a 30. That hits.

01:11:57.522 --> 01:12:03.932
MATT: That hits. You take nine points of fire
damage, as just striking it, the flames burst back

01:12:03.932 --> 01:12:06.303
and burn towards your face and torso from the
impact.

01:12:06.303 --> 01:12:08.705
MARISHA: Did I put fire resist on you? At the end
of last game?

01:12:08.705 --> 01:12:10.967
TALIESIN: Yes, you did! I have fire resist on me.

01:12:10.967 --> 01:12:12.231
MATT: Okay.

01:12:12.231 --> 01:12:13.808
MARISHA: So you take half damage.

01:12:13.808 --> 01:12:16.068
TALIESIN: So that's how much? How much fire
damage?

01:12:16.068 --> 01:12:17.652
MATT: That would be four. Four damage.

01:12:17.652 --> 01:12:19.254
TALIESIN: Four damage? Four damage. Four.

01:12:19.254 --> 01:12:22.416
MATT: All right. And roll damage for your strike.

01:12:22.416 --> 01:12:26.304
TALIESIN: Ooh! 15 points of damage.

01:12:26.304 --> 01:12:32.517
MATT: Hmm! All right. Do you want to make a second
attack, you said? Or are you just going to keep

01:12:32.517 --> 01:12:36.743
going back and forth, what's your plan? Whatcha
doing? Whatcha doing, Percy?

01:12:36.743 --> 01:12:41.321
TALIESIN: He's being a dick. I'm going to try and
break away and back up, I'm going to try and roll

01:12:41.321 --> 01:12:43.864
away from him to be on the other side of the
rock.

01:12:43.864 --> 01:12:51.686
MATT: Okay. As you roll away, it's going to take
an attack of opportunity at you. That is an 18 to hit?

01:12:51.686 --> 01:12:58.108
TALIESIN: My armor class is 18, but I'm going to
use my shield for plus five to my AC, so that won't hit.

01:12:58.108 --> 01:13:02.075
MATT: Okay, so you use your shield brooch, okay.
As it strikes out towards you, streaking its

01:13:02.075 --> 01:13:05.989
elemental claws outward, you back away, instilling
the power of the brooch, and you see an arcane

01:13:05.989 --> 01:13:11.541
shield temporarily ricochets, pushing its claw
away from you. You run away unharmed to the other

01:13:11.541 --> 01:13:12.941
side of the rock.

01:13:12.941 --> 01:13:16.172
TALIESIN: Instead of going to the other side of
the rock, I'm going to run straight back, and I'm

01:13:16.172 --> 01:13:19.628
just going to shoot at it as I run away. I'm going
to make two more shots at it.

01:13:19.628 --> 01:13:21.355
MATT: Go for it.

01:13:21.355 --> 01:13:27.300
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to take one more shot,
because I have to reload. That's a 15.

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:28.935
MATT: 15 hits.

01:13:28.935 --> 01:13:30.773
TALIESIN: Wow! Holy cow.

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:32.435
MATT: Elementals aren't very hard to hit.

01:13:32.435 --> 01:13:39.973
TALIESIN: No, that was amazing. That's ten points
of damage. And then I reload.

01:13:39.973 --> 01:13:42.602
MATT: All right, and you reload. All right, that
ends Percy's turn. Scanlan, you're up.

01:13:42.602 --> 01:13:46.892
SAM: Who's behind me back there, way at the edge
of the map?

01:13:46.892 --> 01:13:48.504
MATT: Over there?

01:13:48.574 --> 01:13:49.917
LAURA: That's Vax.

01:13:49.917 --> 01:13:57.611
SAM: That's Vax? Oh, he'll be fine. Okay, I don't
want to be near this thing, probably. Right?

01:13:57.611 --> 01:13:58.975
MATT: That's your call.

01:13:58.975 --> 01:14:02.067
SAM: Okay, I'm going to take a step towards Vax.

01:14:02.067 --> 01:14:03.192
MATT: Okay.

01:14:03.192 --> 01:14:11.942
SAM: And away from Gern, right? So is Gern 15 feet
away from me yet, so far?

01:14:11.942 --> 01:14:14.250
MATT: He's 15 feet from you, yeah.

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:20.906
SAM: Okay. So I will then cast Thunderwave, which
should not hit Gern, but will hit Vax.

01:14:20.906 --> 01:14:22.409
MATT: Is that a 15-foot radius?

01:14:22.409 --> 01:14:24.413
SAM: It's a 15-foot cube.

01:14:24.413 --> 01:14:27.436
MATT: Cube, so you can just make the cube here,
and it'll hit none of them.

01:14:27.436 --> 01:14:35.812
SAM: Oh! Oh, great. I'll do that. And I'll do it
at level two. Thunderwave.

01:14:35.812 --> 01:14:45.495
MATT: All right, level two Thunderwave. Coming on
up. Oh, it's a self. A 15-foot cube originating

01:14:45.495 --> 01:14:47.303
from you, so yeah, so you can hit that guy.

01:14:47.303 --> 01:14:48.684
SAM: Yeah, originating from me.

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:50.963
MATT: All right, cool. So, level three, that's
3d8, let's see if it makes its constitution saving

01:14:50.963 --> 01:14:54.273
throw. It does not, not with a natural seven. So
go ahead and roll your damage,

01:14:54.273 --> 01:14:55.940
3d8 thunder damage.

01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:58.414
SAM: Not very much -- Ooh! That's pretty good.
20.

01:14:58.414 --> 01:15:00.174
MARISHA: Nice!

01:15:00.174 --> 01:15:02.487
MATT: 20! How do you want to do this?

01:15:02.487 --> 01:15:05.347
(cheering)

01:15:05.347 --> 01:15:07.055
TRAVIS: Scanlan Shorthalt!

01:15:07.055 --> 01:15:14.776
SAM: I send the Thunderwave out by cracking my
knuckles, and as I do so, I do: ahem, Gern,

01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:16.291
might want to check this out.

01:15:16.291 --> 01:15:18.430
CHRIS: Oh, I'm looking at something over here.

01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:19.741
SAM: Gern!

01:15:19.741 --> 01:15:21.626
CHRIS: I'll be with you in just a minute, I'm
dealing with something.

01:15:21.626 --> 01:15:23.372
SAM: Gern, I'm doing something really cool here.

01:15:23.372 --> 01:15:25.075
CHRIS: I'll be with you in just a minute.

01:15:25.075 --> 01:15:27.801
SAM: Fuck. So I do it anyway but with a scowl on
my face.

01:15:27.801 --> 01:15:29.141
CHRIS: All right, what did I miss?

01:15:29.141 --> 01:15:30.050
SAM: Fuck!

01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:34.251
CHRIS: Oh, I was just, why didn't you wait? I just
said a minute.

01:15:34.251 --> 01:15:36.333
SAM: Oh, forget it, you had to be there.

01:15:36.333 --> 01:15:39.077
CHRIS: All right. I was here, but you didn't-- you
should've told me.

01:15:39.077 --> 01:15:44.034
MATT: You even missed your own Thunderwave spell,
you were so distracted with your frustration. You

01:15:44.034 --> 01:15:47.849
look back, you cracked your knuckles, and it's
gone, but you didn't see it happen and it's a

01:15:47.849 --> 01:15:49.201
little disappointing overall.

01:15:49.201 --> 01:15:50.441
SAM: I kick the dirt.

01:15:50.441 --> 01:15:59.039
MATT: All right. You guys look over as this
elemental runs off towards the glowing doorway you

01:15:59.039 --> 01:16:05.383
see further down this passage. It's not that far
away from you, but you do see the flickering

01:16:05.383 --> 01:16:10.541
doorway that's like (sputtering). You can see
other entities beginning to step out of it, and you

01:16:10.541 --> 01:16:18.957
can see one larger form. It looks fiery, humanoid,
just (crackling) comes out, lower body made of ash

01:16:18.957 --> 01:16:20.117
and cinders.

01:16:20.117 --> 01:16:24.800
MARISHA: I rush that way and look for my other
tribe. Can I see any of my other tribemates?

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.838
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:16:26.838 --> 01:16:28.533
LIAM: You're running at them.

01:16:28.533 --> 01:16:31.820
TRAVIS: So if they're frozen, does that mean
they're dead?

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:33.823
MATT: You can go find out.

01:16:33.823 --> 01:16:35.166
LAURA: They'll probably melt eventually.

01:16:35.166 --> 01:16:37.692
TRAVIS: Yeah, can I walk over there close to
them?

01:16:37.692 --> 01:16:40.825
MARISHA: That's better. That one keeps fucking me.
What'd you say? Perception?

01:16:40.825 --> 01:16:41.915
MATT: Yes.

01:16:41.915 --> 01:16:43.044
MARISHA: 26.

01:16:43.044 --> 01:16:45.287
MATT: 26. Currently, from where you stand--

01:16:45.287 --> 01:16:47.051
MARISHA: No, sorry, sorry. 24.

01:16:47.051 --> 01:16:51.968
MATT: 24. From where you stand, you can look off
in the distance, you can see parts of the treeline

01:16:51.968 --> 01:16:56.977
across, down the Cindergrove, shifting and moving,
and you hear the distant sounds of combat, but you

01:16:56.977 --> 01:17:00.079
do not have a visual perspective. It looks like
the other teams have not quite made their way to

01:17:00.079 --> 01:17:08.335
the center. You're actually the first team to get
here. And you made your way around a possible

01:17:08.335 --> 01:17:12.460
encounter, and in doing so, arrived before the
other teams did. However, it looks like a

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:15.646
secondary line of defense is now pouring out of
this doorway.

01:17:15.646 --> 01:17:16.991
LAURA: Oh shit.

01:17:16.991 --> 01:17:19.633
TRAVIS: Can I make my way to the two frozen
statue-types?

01:17:19.633 --> 01:17:20.944
MATT: There's three statues, actually.

01:17:20.944 --> 01:17:22.039
TRAVIS: Or three of 'em, yeah.

01:17:22.039 --> 01:17:23.357
MATT: Including Fatty Arbuckle.

01:17:23.357 --> 01:17:27.256
TRAVIS: Fatty Arbuckle. Can I make my way over to
one of them and-- should I just

01:17:27.256 --> 01:17:28.533
make sure they're dead?

01:17:28.533 --> 01:17:30.325
LAURA: Yeah, just push 'em over, smash them.

01:17:30.325 --> 01:17:32.534
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, can I push Trident-dick over?

01:17:32.534 --> 01:17:37.245
MATT: Yeah. As you shove-- and it's a pretty heavy
form, especially with the ice that's, you know,

01:17:37.245 --> 01:17:38.602
formed around the body--

01:17:38.602 --> 01:17:39.617
TRAVIS: Come on.

01:17:39.617 --> 01:17:44.378
MATT: --but not too hard for you, Grog, because
you're Grog. You give a little shove, and as it

01:17:44.378 --> 01:17:47.554
topples over, it just shatters into 100 pieces.

01:17:47.554 --> 01:17:49.472
TRAVIS: Ooh, like the T-1000.

01:17:49.472 --> 01:17:51.534
LIAM: What?

01:17:51.534 --> 01:17:52.559
TRAVIS: Yeah, I dunno.

01:17:52.559 --> 01:17:53.768
LAURA: Do the other one now.

01:17:53.768 --> 01:17:55.524
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, can I go over and do the other
one, like, (giggles).

01:17:55.524 --> 01:17:57.331
MATT: Yeah. This time, you give this one a full
push, this one actually gets

01:17:57.331 --> 01:17:58.696
about ten feet in the air.

01:17:58.696 --> 01:17:59.730
MARISHA: Cow-tipper!

01:17:59.730 --> 01:18:04.639
MATT: Before scattering across the ground, pieces
of it actually spilling into the molten lava. And

01:18:04.639 --> 01:18:13.530
there stands, frozen in place, Fatty Arbuckle,
chest destroyed, arm limp to the side, just--

01:18:13.530 --> 01:18:18.168
TRAVIS: Can I pick him up and walk him back
over to Gern and go: sorry.

01:18:18.168 --> 01:18:23.469
MATT: You see the half-giant goliath
handing you the frozen body

01:18:23.469 --> 01:18:24.787
of your skeletal friend.

01:18:24.787 --> 01:18:26.922
CHRIS: Well, I don't know what I'm supposed to do
with this, now.

01:18:26.922 --> 01:18:28.178
TRAVIS: You don't want him?

01:18:28.178 --> 01:18:32.038
CHRIS: I mean, he's not very-- maybe we could have
a quick burial.

01:18:32.038 --> 01:18:33.968
LAURA: You could hang a coat on him.

01:18:33.968 --> 01:18:39.380
CHRIS: So we basically would just carry him around
as a coat-rack.

01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:40.919
LIAM: Don't we have company incoming?

01:18:40.919 --> 01:18:44.296
LAURA: We have a Bag of Holding. Oh, there's a
giant monster. I Hunter's Mark it.

01:18:44.296 --> 01:18:45.777
Is it close by?

01:18:45.777 --> 01:18:50.419
MATT: We'll get to that as soon as we come back
from this break. We're going to take a quick

01:18:50.419 --> 01:18:55.772
bathroom break and we'll see you guys back here in
about ten minutes or so to continue this next step

01:18:55.772 --> 01:18:57.280
in the adventure.

01:18:57.280 --> 01:34:10.621
[break]

01:34:10.621 --> 01:34:16.628
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to
Critical Role. Last we left off, the party was

01:34:16.628 --> 01:34:20.801
making their way towards the center of the caldera
where the portal torn open to the fire elemental

01:34:20.867 --> 01:34:26.251
plane resides over a flow of molten rock pouring
in three directions from the center of the

01:34:26.251 --> 01:34:31.276
mountain. Seeing a number of entities swirling
around, and some pouring forth from this open

01:34:31.276 --> 01:34:36.991
doorway, Vox Machina and their current temporary
ally by the traveling dragonborn

01:34:36.991 --> 01:34:45.902
wizard/necromancer/candlemaker named Gern Blanston
have made their way in this direction. Now, before

01:34:45.902 --> 01:34:49.632
we start, just to remind you guys, I guess we're
getting pretty close to 16k subscribers, and when

01:34:49.632 --> 01:34:52.399
we hit 16k something with a sloth is going to
happen.

01:34:52.399 --> 01:34:53.759
LAURA: Not tonight, though.

01:34:53.759 --> 01:34:55.388
MATT: No, not, I don't think tonight.

01:34:55.388 --> 01:34:57.009
SAM: We have a sloth on standby.

01:34:57.009 --> 01:35:07.435
MATT: There will be a sloth apparently that will
come here for 16k and a sloth. And if you want to

01:35:07.435 --> 01:35:08.850
watch Laura freak out--

01:35:08.850 --> 01:35:10.845
LAURA: Ah, so much!

01:35:10.845 --> 01:35:15.789
MATT: Also, we have a giveaway winner for the
evening; ToastKingJr is the winner of

01:35:15.789 --> 01:35:21.532
tonight's Critical Role giveaway, congratulations.
Well done, you, we'll be sending you a lot of fun

01:35:21.532 --> 01:35:23.375
goodies your way very shortly, so--

01:35:23.375 --> 01:35:25.263
CHRIS: Our regards to ToastKing senior.

01:35:25.263 --> 01:35:29.100
MATT: Oh yes; well, you've made him proud. Make
sure to let him know. We'll give him a little a

01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:37.081
little pipe or something inside too, it'll be
good. All right, so you guys gather yourselves,

01:35:37.081 --> 01:35:41.270
stepping through the battlefield you had just
encountered, the shattered and slowly melting

01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:46.466
pieces of ice that once were some of these fire
elemental denizens scattered around your feet, you

01:35:46.466 --> 01:35:51.721
step forward as you see the somewhat human,
somewhat flame-based entity come pouring out of

01:35:51.721 --> 01:35:56.651
the void, surrounded by other elementals, and one
of the other standing salamander general-type

01:35:56.651 --> 01:35:59.242
individuals. You can see--

01:35:59.242 --> 01:36:00.625
MARISHA: This is coming out of the rift?

01:36:00.625 --> 01:36:01.865
MATT: Yes, coming out of the rift.

01:36:01.865 --> 01:36:03.146
LAURA: Is that behind him, is that what the--

01:36:03.146 --> 01:36:04.679
MATT: This is the actual doorway right there.

01:36:04.679 --> 01:36:09.313
MARISHA: Oh, and so this is a pool of lava
that they're coming out of?

01:36:09.313 --> 01:36:11.684
MATT: Yes, this is all molten--

01:36:11.684 --> 01:36:14.107
MARISHA: Molten fire plane, more or less?

01:36:14.107 --> 01:36:18.786
MATT: Well, this is actual lava from the inside of
the mountain that has been called forth and

01:36:18.786 --> 01:36:22.148
cracked through the surface, because of the
presence of the tear.

01:36:22.148 --> 01:36:23.459
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

01:36:23.459 --> 01:36:25.431
CHRIS: Probably fine.

01:36:25.431 --> 01:36:30.246
TRAVIS: Probably. I don't think this will be bad

01:36:30.246 --> 01:36:33.443
TALIESIN: We did not take a short rest, did we?

01:36:33.443 --> 01:36:36.084
MATT: No, you did not.

01:36:36.084 --> 01:36:39.004
TALIESIN: There has been no time.

01:36:39.004 --> 01:36:54.463
MARISHA: I'm going to, and upon seeing this, drop
my fire elemental form and I say: oh shit, I have

01:36:54.463 --> 01:36:58.862
a feeling this is the 'him' they were talking
about. And I have a feeling he's not going to

01:36:58.862 --> 01:37:03.856
believe that I'm the real new master. So there's
that.

01:37:03.856 --> 01:37:08.941
LAURA: So do some cold stuff, like this guy.

01:37:08.941 --> 01:37:12.280
MATT: I'd like you all to make a stealth check, by
the way, as this is transpiring, and these

01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:13.965
entities are now making--

01:37:13.965 --> 01:37:16.414
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace? Is that still in
effect?

01:37:16.414 --> 01:37:18.161
MATT: No, you cast Hunter's Mark, so the
concentration on that ended,

01:37:18.161 --> 01:37:19.547
unfortunately, sorry.

01:37:19.547 --> 01:37:25.640
CHRIS: 14.

01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:27.026
SAM: 15.

01:37:27.026 --> 01:37:28.016
TALIESIN: 13.

01:37:28.016 --> 01:37:29.495
SAM: Oh wait, with Pass Without a Trace?

01:37:29.495 --> 01:37:30.536
MARISHA and LAURA: No.

01:37:30.536 --> 01:37:31.467
MARISHA: 24.

01:37:31.467 --> 01:37:32.420
LIAM: 34.

01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:33.370
LAURA: 22.

01:37:33.370 --> 01:37:34.372
TRAVIS: 20.

01:37:34.372 --> 01:37:42.875
MATT: As you guys are all having this
conversation, hushed behind this barricade of

01:37:42.875 --> 01:37:49.697
broken tree elements, you can see this salamander
general turn and hiss in that direction, look

01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:59.031
over, and point his trident in the direction of
where you all are. You can see the larger fire

01:37:59.031 --> 01:38:05.964
elementals all of a sudden turn their attention
in the direction of the party, as the humanoid

01:38:05.964 --> 01:38:11.575
floating about five feet off the ground, his lower
form just this swirl of cinders and black ash,

01:38:11.575 --> 01:38:20.326
chuckles with his arms crossed. Points forward,
and the elementals begin moving forward.

01:38:20.326 --> 01:38:24.874
MARISHA: Can Keyleth do a quick ancillary action
before shit happens?

01:38:24.874 --> 01:38:29.355
MATT: Well, this would be the initiative order
now, so everyone roll initiative.

01:38:29.355 --> 01:38:32.483
LIAM: Maybe they see something behind us.

01:38:32.483 --> 01:38:35.894
TRAVIS: Fuck!

01:38:35.894 --> 01:38:40.366
MARISHA: Jesus, sucking it up today.

01:38:40.366 --> 01:38:58.162
MATT: All right, folks, this brings us to 25 to
20?

01:38:58.162 --> 01:38:59.817
LIAM: 20.

01:38:59.817 --> 01:39:01.273
SAM: Hey!

01:39:01.273 --> 01:39:02.910
TRAVIS: Jude.

01:39:02.910 --> 01:39:05.361
CHRIS: Don't make it bad.

01:39:05.361 --> 01:39:08.211
TALIESIN: (singing) Take a bad roll...

01:39:08.211 --> 01:39:10.406
MATT: 20 to 15?

01:39:10.406 --> 01:39:11.742
LAURA: 19.

01:39:11.742 --> 01:39:16.855
CHRIS: Yes, I'm 16.

01:39:16.855 --> 01:39:20.122
MATT: 16 for Gern.

01:39:20.122 --> 01:39:22.582
LIAM: ErmahGern!

01:39:22.582 --> 01:39:24.249
MATT: 15 to ten?

01:39:24.249 --> 01:39:25.465
TALIESIN: 13.

01:39:25.465 --> 01:39:30.079
MATT: 13 for Percy. Ten to five?

01:39:30.079 --> 01:39:31.980
TRAVIS: Eight.

01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:34.852
MATT: Eight for Grog. Scanlan, what's your--

01:39:34.852 --> 01:39:37.657
SAM: Oh, ten, sorry, ten, ten.

01:39:37.657 --> 01:39:45.940
MATT: So that would be just below you, Percy. All
righty. I believe that's all on that end there.

01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:47.148
And that brings us to--

01:39:47.148 --> 01:39:50.737
MARISHA: I'm seven, by the way.

01:39:50.737 --> 01:39:52.195
MATT: Oh, seven, thought I got you.

01:39:52.195 --> 01:39:54.244
LAURA: Nobody cares, Marisha.

01:39:54.244 --> 01:39:58.405
MARISHA: I know, I'll just... be back here...
caboose.

01:39:58.405 --> 01:40:09.060
MATT: There we go. So right before Grog is
Keyleth. Great. All right.

01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:10.735
Top of the combat round.

01:40:10.735 --> 01:40:12.559
MARISHA: Yeah, nope. Not leading.

01:40:12.559 --> 01:40:14.495
MATT: All right.

01:40:14.495 --> 01:40:16.217
MARISHA: Shitty initiative roll.

01:40:16.217 --> 01:40:18.199
SAM: It's going to be fine.

01:40:18.199 --> 01:40:22.953
TALIESIN: He's cut things out of cardboard. This
doesn't look fun.

01:40:22.953 --> 01:40:27.329
MARISHA: There was planning. There was a thought
process.

01:40:27.329 --> 01:40:29.496
TRAVIS: Oh shit, towers.

01:40:29.496 --> 01:40:33.799
TALIESIN: There was an instructables involved in this.
This is just really-- we're doomed.

01:40:33.799 --> 01:40:37.758
TRAVIS: No, no, he was down in the play zone
before!

01:40:37.758 --> 01:40:45.763
MATT: Tell me who wants to roll an arcana check as
you see this entity rising up--

01:40:45.763 --> 01:40:47.281
TRAVIS: Oh, absolutely.

01:40:47.281 --> 01:40:48.661
SAM: I will, as well.

01:40:48.661 --> 01:40:50.011
MATT: For people who are proficient with it.

01:40:50.011 --> 01:40:51.359
TRAVIS: Two.

01:40:51.359 --> 01:40:53.062
SAM: Oh, with disadvantage, right?

01:40:53.062 --> 01:40:54.437
MATT: Yes, you do.

01:40:54.437 --> 01:40:55.759
LIAM: So tired.

01:40:55.759 --> 01:40:57.066
CHRIS: 24.

01:40:57.066 --> 01:41:00.232
TRAVIS: Whoa! Get out of here, dragonborn!

01:41:00.232 --> 01:41:02.195
SAM: Look at the big brain on Gern.

01:41:02.195 --> 01:41:04.372
CHRIS: I'm very smart.

01:41:04.372 --> 01:41:08.840
MATT: (laughs) And as you say that, you recognize
this entity and blurt out its name, just

01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:13.744
instinctually as you get a proper view of it. One
of the many denizens of the fire elemental plane,

01:41:13.744 --> 01:41:15.928
this is an efreeti, it is a fire genie.

01:41:15.928 --> 01:41:17.973
SAM: A nefreeti?

01:41:17.973 --> 01:41:23.770
MATT: Efreeti. Yes, the species is efreeti, but an
ee-frit, ee-freet, however you want to pronounce

01:41:23.770 --> 01:41:29.008
it, a flame genie, generally hailing from the City
of Brass and/or spaces around and in the fire

01:41:29.008 --> 01:41:30.183
elemental plane.

01:41:30.183 --> 01:41:31.448
TALIESIN: I could feel it from that side.

01:41:31.448 --> 01:41:32.645
LIAM: I was thinking it.

01:41:32.645 --> 01:41:34.518
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, I could feel it.

01:41:34.518 --> 01:41:41.762
MATT: Floats above all of you, arms still crossed,
opens its arms and as it chuckles, both hands just

01:41:41.762 --> 01:41:49.086
are engulfed in flames that congeal into these
large fiery balls as it flings them both down in

01:41:49.086 --> 01:41:50.832
the direction of the party.

01:41:50.832 --> 01:41:54.552
TRAVIS: Feel like we're in MegaMan. A MegaMan
boss.

01:41:54.552 --> 01:41:56.434
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah!

01:41:56.434 --> 01:42:00.320
MATT: This is going to be at Scanlan and Vex.

01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:01.601
LAURA: What?!

01:42:01.601 --> 01:42:03.345
SAM: These are Fireballs, right?

01:42:03.345 --> 01:42:05.045
MATT: To Scanlan, that is 13?

01:42:05.045 --> 01:42:06.154
SAM: No way.

01:42:06.154 --> 01:42:09.631
MATT: Vex, that is 15.

01:42:09.631 --> 01:42:10.689
LAURA: No!

01:42:10.689 --> 01:42:14.403
MATT: Both just (fireball impacts), cracking into
the ground to the sides of where you're standing,

01:42:14.403 --> 01:42:20.283
barely missing them. It keeps glaring down at the
rest of you with a smile. Ending that, it brings

01:42:20.283 --> 01:42:22.854
us to Vax. You're up.

01:42:22.854 --> 01:42:27.603
LIAM: I got a high stealth right beforehand, so am
I hidden at the moment?

01:42:27.603 --> 01:42:31.405
MATT: As far as you know, depending on the
individual. You don't know who saw you

01:42:31.405 --> 01:42:32.622
and who didn't.

01:42:32.622 --> 01:42:38.334
LIAM: As far as I know. All right. Balls. I'm just
going to throw three daggers at the salamander,

01:42:38.334 --> 01:42:39.891
right from where I am.

01:42:39.891 --> 01:42:41.765
MATT: Right from where you are? All right.

01:42:41.765 --> 01:42:49.239
LIAM: Yeah, okay, so. First is a 20, second is a
14, third is a 19.

01:42:49.239 --> 01:42:51.966
MATT: Okay. The first one was what?

01:42:51.966 --> 01:42:53.058
LIAM: 20.

01:42:53.058 --> 01:42:56.781
MATT: The first and the third hit. If you are
hidden, though, which you would technically be

01:42:56.781 --> 01:43:00.422
hidden from this individual, you do have advantage
on those attacks, so you can reroll the--

01:43:00.422 --> 01:43:05.512
LIAM: And if I'm hidden it's a surprise, right? On
that guy? You tell me.

01:43:05.512 --> 01:43:09.661
MATT: No, no, it's a sneak attack if you're
hidden. A surprise round is if they have no idea

01:43:09.661 --> 01:43:10.876
that you're there.

01:43:10.876 --> 01:43:16.708
LIAM: Okay, I thought it was a-- okay, great!
Fine. Love it. Okay, so.

01:43:16.708 --> 01:43:19.956
LAURA: You have advantage, so maybe one of those
would be a 20 if you rerolled them with their

01:43:19.956 --> 01:43:21.505
advantages.

01:43:21.505 --> 01:43:40.735
LIAM: All right. No, and other one, no. So, four,
eight, 12, 13, 16, 20, 31, 35 for the first. And

01:43:40.735 --> 01:43:43.183
the second one is a ten.

01:43:43.183 --> 01:43:45.255
TRAVIS: Kick us off strong!

01:43:45.255 --> 01:43:51.340
MATT: Not bad! Flinging both daggers, one strikes
it square in the sternum and the blade cracks and

01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:55.213
pops as it hits the center of the chest. It
(gurgle), you know, it can't make any sound as it

01:43:55.213 --> 01:43:59.420
disappears from the wound, returning to your belt.
The second dagger manages to come towards, it

01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:03.036
tries to parry out of the air, but in doing so
just gets it embedded in its forearm and it

01:44:03.036 --> 01:44:08.651
shrieks out in pain, as that too vanishes and
appears once again in your belt. Are you going to move,

01:44:08.651 --> 01:44:09.778
or stay where you are?

01:44:09.778 --> 01:44:13.626
LIAM: I'm going to move. I'm going to skip to my
right and stand behind Grog and spank him on the

01:44:13.626 --> 01:44:15.729
ass and say: go get 'em, tiger.

01:44:15.729 --> 01:44:17.612
MATT: "Go get 'em, tiger." Right there. All
righty.

01:44:17.612 --> 01:44:19.237
TRAVIS: My name's Grog.

01:44:19.237 --> 01:44:21.507
MATT: Vex, you're up.

01:44:21.507 --> 01:44:28.000
LAURA: Are those trees, do they have any substance
at all, or are they just there to look pretty?

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:33.434
MATT: I mean, you could get behind them if you
want to, they're maybe about that wide.

01:44:33.434 --> 01:44:36.912
LIAM: They're like Charlie Brown Christmas trees?

01:44:36.912 --> 01:44:40.772
MATT: Practically. As far as the Cindergrove's
concerned, they're pretty sad-looking. A lot of them have

01:44:40.772 --> 01:44:42.727
been destroyed and torn and pushed down around.

01:44:42.773 --> 01:44:44.949
LAURA: All right. I'm going to try to use one as
protection. I'm going to hop behind

01:44:44.949 --> 01:44:46.605
the one over this way.

01:44:46.605 --> 01:44:48.469
MATT: This way, here?

01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:50.349
LAURA: And I'm going to Hunter's Mark the efreeti.

01:44:50.349 --> 01:44:54.343
MATT: All righty. Mark the efreeti.

01:44:54.343 --> 01:44:57.434
LAURA: And then I'm going to use my Longbow of the
Sky Sentinel. And I'm going to

01:44:57.434 --> 01:44:59.217
shoot him three times!

01:44:59.217 --> 01:45:00.639
MATT: Go for it.

01:45:00.639 --> 01:45:05.818
LAURA: That first one probably does not succeed.
It is a 16.

01:45:05.818 --> 01:45:07.467
MATT: That does not hit, nope.

01:45:07.467 --> 01:45:09.690
LAURA: What about 23?

01:45:09.690 --> 01:45:10.676
MATT: That does hit.

01:45:10.676 --> 01:45:15.638
LAURA: All right. How about... mega miss. So one
of those hits, because I'm a loser.

01:45:15.638 --> 01:45:22.934
MATT: Streaking past, and the third one hits as
he's holding the flame balls in his hands. Seeing

01:45:22.934 --> 01:45:27.186
the small impact, he just glares at you though the
impact.

01:45:27.186 --> 01:45:30.393
TRAVIS: You need to sacrifice a small mammal.
Maybe we can find a squirrel or something.

01:45:30.393 --> 01:45:31.607
LAURA: 11.

01:45:31.607 --> 01:45:33.564
TRAVIS: A pagan ritual.

01:45:33.564 --> 01:45:35.479
TALIESIN: I can hook you up. I have a kit.

01:45:35.479 --> 01:45:37.725
TRAVIS: (laughter) Why am I not surprised?

01:45:37.725 --> 01:45:40.509
LAURA: 17 points of damage and that's it because I
suck.

01:45:40.509 --> 01:45:44.595
MATT: 17 points of damage. And you are hiding
behind the tree?

01:45:44.595 --> 01:45:46.245
LAURA: I am hiding behind the tree.

01:45:46.245 --> 01:45:49.233
MATT: That's the end of Vex's turn. It is now the
elementals' turns.

01:45:49.233 --> 01:45:51.275
LAURA: These piece-of-shit dice.

01:45:51.275 --> 01:46:00.070
MATT: This is going to move in and actually
consumes the space of Gern and his followers.

01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:02.183
TALIESIN: That's not even a figurine, it's just a
chunk of plastic.

01:46:02.183 --> 01:46:07.147
MATT: So as you're sitting there, you just see
this fire elemental just streak around real fast

01:46:07.147 --> 01:46:12.828
and all of a sudden step into the space where you
and your two undead followers are, flames whirling

01:46:12.828 --> 01:46:21.328
around you. All of you immediately take five
points of fire damage, you and your two allies.

01:46:21.328 --> 01:46:25.928
Stimpy and Coral, poor guys.

01:46:25.928 --> 01:46:37.672
CHRIS: Weren't there-- oh, they killed one, that's
right, and you guys fucking killed one, too.

01:46:37.672 --> 01:46:50.380
MATT: With that, it's going to make two strikes
towards you, Gern. The fire elemental rushes in

01:46:50.380 --> 01:46:52.221
and just (slithering fire noises).

01:46:52.221 --> 01:46:53.889
CHRIS: Not the vest, not the vest!

01:46:53.889 --> 01:47:00.226
MATT: That is going to be a 13 to hit. What's your
armor class?

01:47:00.226 --> 01:47:01.340
CHRIS: 13.

01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:04.442
MATT: Just hits you. And that's a natural 20.

01:47:04.442 --> 01:47:06.629
(sighs and groans)

01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:08.568
MATT: So you take 14 points of fire damage from
the first one.

01:47:08.568 --> 01:47:10.435
CHRIS: Doesn't feel very natural.

01:47:10.435 --> 01:47:16.023
LIAM: Thanks for coming, thanks for playing.

01:47:16.023 --> 01:47:26.561
MATT: 19 points of fire damage from the second
strike. And you are currently engulfed in flame.

01:47:26.561 --> 01:47:29.682
You caught fire from the impact with the fire
elemental.

01:47:29.682 --> 01:47:34.500
CHRIS: It doesn't hurt, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm
part dragon.

01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:36.789
LAURA: Do dragonborn have natural fire
resistance?

01:47:36.789 --> 01:47:38.427
MATT: Certain ones do, not blue ones.

01:47:38.427 --> 01:47:39.729
LAURA: Oh no!

01:47:39.729 --> 01:47:43.765
CHRIS: If it was lightning, it'd be fine. But no.

01:47:43.765 --> 01:47:58.625
MATT: That ends that elemental's turn. This one is
going to step into the space where both Percy and

01:47:58.625 --> 01:48:02.493
Scanlan are. Both of you guys immediately suffer
seven points of fire damage.

01:48:02.493 --> 01:48:04.563
TALIESIN: I'm halved because I have resistance.

01:48:04.563 --> 01:48:09.756
MATT: Correct, so you'd take three points. And
it's going to make a strike on each of you. That's

01:48:09.756 --> 01:48:14.864
going to be a 14 versus you, Scanlan.

01:48:14.864 --> 01:48:17.255
SAM: That does not hit me.

01:48:17.255 --> 01:48:21.347
MATT: And then versus Percy. Same roll. 14.

01:48:21.347 --> 01:48:24.678
TALIESIN: (laughter) Ah, you're adorable.

01:48:24.678 --> 01:48:29.905
MATT: Misses you both with a series of terrible
attacks. That ends their turn. Gern, you're up. At

01:48:29.905 --> 01:48:31.944
the start of your turn--

01:48:31.944 --> 01:48:33.775
CHRIS: It's my turn.

01:48:33.775 --> 01:48:36.070
TALIESIN: But first you have to take your fire
damage.

01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:41.278
CHRIS: Oh, I'm still on fire.

01:48:41.278 --> 01:48:48.529
MATT: Yep. At the top of your turn, because you're
now on fire, you take six points of fire damage.

01:48:48.529 --> 01:48:53.824
You're just wreathed in fire, all around. It's a
bad, bad Sunday for Gern.

01:48:53.824 --> 01:49:05.212
CHRIS: Oh boy. I'm trying to find something that
won't destroy-- How close is everyone to me?

01:49:05.212 --> 01:49:06.553
Everyone's pretty close.

01:49:06.553 --> 01:49:09.289
SAM: No one's near the big guy.

01:49:09.289 --> 01:49:12.261
CHRIS: No, but I'm standing right there.

01:49:12.261 --> 01:49:20.110
TALIESIN: Here, you can see it right here. You're
that little red ring right there, and then your

01:49:20.110 --> 01:49:26.563
two followers are right there. If you have
anything that goes in a cube, you'd be fine. Do

01:49:26.563 --> 01:49:28.278
you have anything that's a cube shot?

01:49:28.278 --> 01:49:29.871
CHRIS: And which way am I facing?

01:49:29.871 --> 01:49:31.760
TALIESIN: Whichever way you want to be facing.

01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:42.678
CHRIS: I mean, I guess-- I'd like to run around
and throw another Cone of Cold aimed at that guy,

01:49:42.678 --> 01:49:45.488
and then up at the prick hovering above everyone.

01:49:45.488 --> 01:49:46.837
MATT: This direction, you mean?

01:49:46.837 --> 01:49:48.054
CHRIS: Yes. Aye!

01:49:48.054 --> 01:49:54.108
MATT: So you can move around to this side of the
elemental, pushing past your allies, whip around,

01:49:54.108 --> 01:49:59.107
you get a little bit of a view through the fire and
flames swirling around you. You concentrate and

01:49:59.107 --> 01:50:04.401
release a burst of cold energy. It might not be
close enough.

01:50:04.401 --> 01:50:07.057
CHRIS: Of course it is!

01:50:07.057 --> 01:50:12.464
MATT: It'll be enough to get those two there.

01:50:12.464 --> 01:50:15.692
CHRIS: All right, well, I suppose that's better
than nothing at all.

01:50:15.692 --> 01:50:17.430
SAM: That's impressive.

01:50:17.430 --> 01:50:20.087
MATT: It's better than nothing. All right, so
constitution saves on the elemental.

01:50:20.087 --> 01:50:23.013
What's your DC?

01:50:23.013 --> 01:50:24.376
CHRIS: 16.

01:50:24.376 --> 01:50:32.180
MATT: 16. It fails. On the salamander, that's another
big fail with a 13. So go ahead

01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:34.069
and roll 8d8 damage.

01:50:34.069 --> 01:50:51.907
CHRIS: (counting) 40. I'm sorry. What was that
last one? Shit. 35.

01:50:51.907 --> 01:50:57.131
MATT: Nice, 35 points of cold damage to both the
salamander and the elemental in front of you.

01:50:57.131 --> 01:51:05.159
Great. So you see as a blast of winter arcane
energy just skirts forward, casting most of the

01:51:05.159 --> 01:51:10.966
dark area here in snow and ice and sleet. You can
see the front of this lava pond is cooled for the

01:51:10.966 --> 01:51:16.516
moment and actually can be walked across
probably for one or two more rounds.

01:51:16.516 --> 01:51:18.272
CHRIS: You're welcome.

01:51:18.272 --> 01:51:22.134
LIAM: You're still on fire, by the way.

01:51:22.134 --> 01:51:29.420
MATT: Yes, you are also still on fire. Someone
has to take an action to try and douse the

01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:34.418
flames on him, whether it be himself or possibly
your allies. You can still give actions to your

01:51:34.418 --> 01:51:35.885
two undead buddies.

01:51:35.885 --> 01:51:45.786
CHRIS: Oh. In that case. I think I'd like to ask
the zombie character, who I believe was-- no,

01:51:45.786 --> 01:51:53.338
Stimpy was the skeleton, this is Coral. I'd like
to have Coral rip-- is my skin on fire, or is it

01:51:53.338 --> 01:51:54.638
just my vest?

01:51:54.638 --> 01:51:58.391
MATT: Both, actually. The scales are starting to
crisp.

01:51:58.391 --> 01:52:00.136
CHRIS: Those are really hard to get!

01:52:00.136 --> 01:52:01.172
SAM: The vest?

01:52:01.172 --> 01:52:02.341
CHRIS: Yes!

01:52:02.341 --> 01:52:07.870
TALIESIN: You could just have them swat you. Like
(zombie grunting noises).

01:52:07.870 --> 01:52:16.675
CHRIS: I need to have the zombie hurl its body on
top of me, onto the ground, and roll around on me,

01:52:16.675 --> 01:52:20.034
to get the flame off. It's a very stinky
enterprise.

01:52:20.034 --> 01:52:27.549
MATT: Okay, I'll allow this. You're intentionally
going prone, so you start your next

01:52:27.549 --> 01:52:34.318
combat round on the ground, which means you'll
have half your movement. As Stimpy hobbles over

01:52:34.318 --> 01:52:35.492
(zombie groan).

01:52:35.492 --> 01:52:36.626
SAM: This is Coral.

01:52:36.626 --> 01:52:38.567
CHRIS: Is there like snow or ice on the ground?

01:52:38.567 --> 01:52:40.485
MATT: There is behind the elemental, yes.

01:52:40.485 --> 01:52:42.414
CHRIS: Can he scoop some up?

01:52:42.414 --> 01:52:46.538
MATT: The zombie can take one action,
unfortunately, it's not a super intelligent

01:52:46.538 --> 01:52:48.213
creature. One or the other.

01:52:48.213 --> 01:52:51.875
CHRIS: All right, then, I suppose he just has to
roll on top of me.

01:52:51.875 --> 01:52:55.222
MATT: You guys glance over out of the corner of
your eye and you see is the dragonborn all of

01:52:55.222 --> 01:52:59.108
a sudden jumps to the ground, sprawled out, snow
angel style.

01:52:59.108 --> 01:53:04.670
CHRIS: Do it! Just do it already! What are you
waiting for?!

01:53:04.670 --> 01:53:09.869
MATT: As this undead begins flailing about on top
of his body. You're starting to get elements of

01:53:09.869 --> 01:53:12.213
decaying goo and--

01:53:12.213 --> 01:53:14.136
CHRIS: Yes, it's fucking terrible!

01:53:14.136 --> 01:53:20.195
MATT: But the flames do eventually go out, over
the next five to six seconds or so. What would you

01:53:20.195 --> 01:53:21.716
like Stimpy to do?

01:53:21.716 --> 01:53:31.195
CHRIS: I mean, I guess-- I would have to give him
a candle, wouldn't I?

01:53:31.195 --> 01:53:32.835
MATT: You would, yes.

01:53:32.835 --> 01:53:40.275
CHRIS: Right. Maybe he just scoops up as much ice
and snow as possible, and attacks the--

01:53:40.275 --> 01:53:42.868
MATT: Sure.

01:53:42.868 --> 01:53:45.222
SAM: Snowball fight?

01:53:45.222 --> 01:53:46.893
CHRIS: Snowball fight.

01:53:46.893 --> 01:53:58.117
MATT: He picks up some of the frost on the ground
with his skeletal hands. Flings it. Funnily

01:53:58.117 --> 01:53:59.599
enough, it hits.

01:53:59.599 --> 01:54:01.151
CHRIS: Fuck yeah, it does.

01:54:01.151 --> 01:54:05.719
MATT: Because it's right there. We'll say for that
particular instance, it takes--

01:54:05.719 --> 01:54:07.666
CHRIS: What, like a hundred points of damage?

01:54:07.666 --> 01:54:09.029
MATT: Three points of cold damage.

01:54:09.029 --> 01:54:10.582
(cheers)

01:54:10.582 --> 01:54:17.528
MATT: Immediate steam, in the face of a fire
elemental.

01:54:17.528 --> 01:54:20.228
CHRIS: I smell like cooked cow anus at the
moment.

01:54:20.228 --> 01:54:23.603
MATT: Percy, you're up.

01:54:23.603 --> 01:54:29.943
TALIESIN: Weird question, what saving throw does a
creature have to make with your sword?

01:54:29.943 --> 01:54:31.706
TRAVIS: Wisdom.

01:54:31.706 --> 01:54:33.089
TALIESIN: It's a wisdom saving throw?

01:54:33.089 --> 01:54:34.657
MATT: No, it's constitution.

01:54:34.657 --> 01:54:38.088
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw. Good to
know.

01:54:38.088 --> 01:54:40.402
TRAVIS: I just answered the first thing that popped
into my head.

01:54:40.402 --> 01:54:46.626
TALIESIN: That was wisdom, fascinating. Okay, I'm
right in the thick of it, aren't it?

01:54:46.626 --> 01:54:47.596
MATT: Yes.

01:54:47.596 --> 01:54:55.856
TALIESIN: I'm going to break away, I'll take the
hit. I don't like attacking these

01:54:55.856 --> 01:54:57.187
things straight on.

01:54:57.187 --> 01:55:03.434
MATT: At the top of your turn, by the way, you
take nine points of fire damage, down to four,

01:55:03.434 --> 01:55:09.004
because you are also engulfed in flame, as is
Scanlan for having passed over the space there.

01:55:09.004 --> 01:55:18.805
TALIESIN: Nine points of fire damage, down to
four. Okay. I'm going to break away and take a run

01:55:18.805 --> 01:55:21.554
for it towards that crater in the far right
corner.

01:55:21.554 --> 01:55:24.039
MATT: This way here?

01:55:24.039 --> 01:55:26.418
TALIESIN: Thank you, yes.

01:55:26.418 --> 01:55:29.966
MATT: Running past the fire elemental, it does get
an attack of opportunity on you, swinging out with

01:55:29.966 --> 01:55:34.862
its flaming appendage. That is going to be a 13 to
hit.

01:55:34.862 --> 01:55:39.580
TALIESIN: That ain't going to hit. That's fine,
I'm going to take my bonus action, and I'm going

01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:42.580
to cast Hex on it.

01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:44.057
MATT: On which one?

01:55:44.057 --> 01:55:45.840
TALIESIN: On the one I just ran away from.

01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:49.102
MATT: Okay, that elemental is now currently Hexed.

01:55:49.102 --> 01:55:51.721
TALIESIN: With a disadvantage on constitution
saving throws.

01:55:51.721 --> 01:55:53.167
MATT: Oh, okay!

01:55:53.167 --> 01:55:54.802
TRAVIS: Hey!

01:55:54.802 --> 01:55:56.856
TALIESIN: Teamwork!

01:55:56.856 --> 01:56:00.030
TRAVIS: I don't think he has any blood, though.

01:56:00.030 --> 01:56:01.897
MATT: Is it saving throws, or is it ability
checks?

01:56:01.897 --> 01:56:03.315
TALIESIN: Ability checks.

01:56:03.315 --> 01:56:04.800
MATT: That does not affect saving throws,
unfortunately.

01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:08.271
TALIESIN: God damn it. All right, never mind.
That's fine. Since I've broken off from him, I'm

01:56:08.271 --> 01:56:11.656
going to take some shots at him anyway. I'll take
three shots.

01:56:11.656 --> 01:56:14.006
MATT: Go for it.

01:56:14.006 --> 01:56:17.005
TALIESIN: First one is an 18.

01:56:17.005 --> 01:56:18.690
MATT: 18 hits.

01:56:18.690 --> 01:56:30.648
TALIESIN: That's seven points of damage. Second
one's a sharpshooter. That's 25.

01:56:30.648 --> 01:56:35.219
MATT: 25. And with that shot (boom).

01:56:35.219 --> 01:56:37.316
(cheering)

01:56:37.316 --> 01:56:40.382
TRAVIS: Jeez, leave some for the rest of us, big
boy.

01:56:40.382 --> 01:56:42.015
MARISHA: Oh, wait, why did it go back?

01:56:42.015 --> 01:56:45.555
MATT: Sorry, this is the one that took all the
damage from the Cone of Cold, so this one is still

01:56:45.555 --> 01:56:48.266
fine. Robbed you of victory!

01:56:48.266 --> 01:56:51.709
CHRIS: That was so weird, he disappeared for a
moment and then came right back!

01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:53.464
TALIESIN: I haven't actually damaged him yet, have
I?

01:56:53.464 --> 01:56:54.691
MATT: You did seven damage.

01:56:54.691 --> 01:56:57.899
TALIESIN: That was the first damage. The second
damage I haven't done yet.

01:56:57.899 --> 01:56:59.427
MATT: No, you have not.

01:56:59.427 --> 01:57:02.051
TALIESIN: 20 points of damage.

01:57:02.051 --> 01:57:06.684
MATT: All right, nice. You're adding your Hexes to
this, right?

01:57:06.684 --> 01:57:08.256
TALIESIN: No, I'm not! Oh, shit.

01:57:08.256 --> 01:57:09.825
MATT: Add d6 to each of these, buddy.

01:57:09.825 --> 01:57:17.641
TALIESIN: So that's six extra points, and that's
seven extra points total. Third sharpshooter shot.

01:57:17.641 --> 01:57:24.281
Thank you for reminding me on the Hex. That's a
12, that's going to miss.

01:57:24.281 --> 01:57:28.418
MATT: 12 misses, unfortunately. You shoot too far.
It actually separates its body for a second, the

01:57:28.418 --> 01:57:32.630
flames flickering away from the impact of the
bullet, passing through, no effect,

01:57:32.630 --> 01:57:34.012
unfortunately.

01:57:34.012 --> 01:57:38.505
TALIESIN: Weird thing. Can I spend an action surge
and put myself out of the fire?

01:57:38.505 --> 01:57:39.861
MATT: You can.

01:57:39.861 --> 01:57:41.875
TALIESIN: You know what, it's just fire. I will be
on fire.

01:57:41.875 --> 01:57:43.660
MATT: You will be on fire, Percy.

01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:44.985
TALIESIN: I'm going to be on fire.

01:57:44.985 --> 01:57:46.420
MARISHA: It's just fire.

01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:47.666
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

01:57:47.666 --> 01:57:52.693
SAM: What is holding the thing that's floating in
the sky aloft? Is he flying? Is he supported on a

01:57:52.693 --> 01:57:54.659
column of fire?

01:57:54.659 --> 01:57:57.343
CHRIS: No, he's brought a plastic shelf with
himself, apparently.

01:57:57.343 --> 01:57:59.208
SAM: Oh, of course.

01:57:59.208 --> 01:58:00.623
CHRIS: He's just standing on it.

01:58:00.623 --> 01:58:02.372
MATT: It's Ikea-made, you just have to build it.

01:58:02.372 --> 01:58:03.904
TRAVIS: It's the "schlogel."

01:58:03.904 --> 01:58:08.172
MATT: It appears to be flying. The very essence of
this creature is partial flame and magic, and it's

01:58:08.172 --> 01:58:14.265
levitating as its lower form is a tiny dervish
whirlwind of black ash and flame.

01:58:14.265 --> 01:58:19.877
SAM: And he's a larger creature or smaller?

01:58:19.877 --> 01:58:21.091
MATT: Large.

01:58:21.091 --> 01:58:30.150
SAM: He's a large creature or smaller. Okay. I'm
going to make him the boy in the bubble. I will

01:58:30.150 --> 01:58:33.459
cast Otiluke's Resilient Sphere.

01:58:33.459 --> 01:58:34.824
TALIESIN: Yay!

01:58:34.824 --> 01:58:36.332
MARISHA: What is that?

01:58:36.332 --> 01:58:39.114
SAM: I'm going to make a bubble around him.

01:58:39.114 --> 01:58:42.136
MATT: First you take four points of fire damage,
because you're on fire.

01:58:42.136 --> 01:58:48.421
SAM: Oh, sure, whatever. No, wait, but it was
nine, right? You said? Just four?

01:58:48.421 --> 01:58:51.730
MATT: That was when it originally got to you, and
then you're still burning every turn until you put

01:58:51.730 --> 01:58:55.422
yourself out. The range on the resilient sphere is
30 feet, so you're going to want to get closer to

01:58:55.422 --> 01:58:56.437
cast it.

01:58:56.437 --> 01:58:58.699
SAM: Oh, okay. I'll walk. He's going to hit me,
isn't he?

01:58:58.699 --> 01:59:03.424
MATT: This is cool, currently, if you want to go
across. You can get there, and that'll be enough

01:59:03.424 --> 01:59:04.459
distance.

01:59:04.459 --> 01:59:08.381
SAM: I'll do that, and then straight up in the
air.

01:59:08.381 --> 01:59:17.615
MATT: Okay, so it has to make a dexterity saving
throw. What's the DC? The DC on your spells is a

01:59:17.615 --> 01:59:19.510
20 right now, right?

01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:20.520
SAM: It is.

01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:21.493
TALIESIN: Wow.

01:59:21.493 --> 01:59:23.275
MATT: And it rolled a 19. 18 plus one.

01:59:23.275 --> 01:59:25.027
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

01:59:25.027 --> 01:59:29.576
MATT: And, with that, suddenly you guys see
Scanlan concentrate, shouting the magical

01:59:29.576 --> 01:59:31.303
incantation through the hand cone--

01:59:31.303 --> 01:59:34.028
SAM: You're in a ball, motherfucker!

01:59:34.028 --> 01:59:44.502
MATT: You see a pink-purple-hued globe of
crystalline, magical arcane energy just form

01:59:44.502 --> 01:59:54.301
around the creature, and the efreet goes
(grunting).

01:59:54.301 --> 01:59:57.825
SAM: Does he fall, or can he continue to fly?

01:59:57.825 --> 02:00:03.016
MATT: The sphere is weightless, so no, he stays
where he is.

02:00:03.016 --> 02:00:05.902
LIAM: And is it a good witch, or a bad witch?

02:00:05.902 --> 02:00:13.262
TALIESIN: Science check. Does oxygen penetrate the
sphere?

02:00:13.262 --> 02:00:14.927
SAM: There is still air inside.

02:00:14.927 --> 02:00:17.417
TALIESIN: Damn it. Because that would've been
amazing if he just died.

02:00:17.417 --> 02:00:19.161
CHRIS: I was looking away, what just happened?

02:00:19.161 --> 02:00:20.157
SAM: Oh, fuck!

02:00:20.157 --> 02:00:21.081
CHRIS: What?

02:00:21.081 --> 02:00:22.247
SAM: Always look at me!

02:00:22.247 --> 02:00:26.627
CHRIS: Oh, I was looking at some grubs over by
the--

02:00:26.627 --> 02:00:27.661
TRAVIS: Grubs?

02:00:27.661 --> 02:00:28.640
CHRIS: I'm hungry.

02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:37.411
SAM: Oh, and I'll turn around and I will heal
Gern, because he's not doing great. With my bonus

02:00:37.411 --> 02:00:43.879
action, at a second level, I will cast Healing Word,
and I will sing to him again, because he loves it

02:00:43.879 --> 02:00:44.990
so much.

02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:47.452
CHRIS: You know, I think I'm fine with 26 hit
points.

02:00:47.452 --> 02:00:53.523
SAM: (singing) Gern, baby, Gern! Candle inferno!
Gern, baby, Gern! Burn that mother down!

02:00:53.523 --> 02:00:59.210
MATT: All right. Second level, that's 2d4 plus--

02:00:59.210 --> 02:01:00.366
SAM: Five.

02:01:00.366 --> 02:01:01.712
MATT: 2d4 plus five you heal.

02:01:01.712 --> 02:01:03.887
CHRIS: Oh, do I roll that?

02:01:03.887 --> 02:01:05.224
SAM: Do I roll, or does he?

02:01:05.224 --> 02:01:06.567
MATT: Whichever one. Doesn't matter to me.

02:01:06.567 --> 02:01:14.046
CHRIS: Okay, so nine.

02:01:14.046 --> 02:01:18.411
MATT: All right. Scanlan, I believe that ends your
turn. Keyleth, you're up.

02:01:18.411 --> 02:01:24.935
CHRIS: Thank you. I will never again not watch
your spellcasting! You tiny bundle of adorable

02:01:24.935 --> 02:01:26.420
creature!

02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:34.985
MARISHA: Is that guy and that guy within 30 feet
of each other? It's hard to tell with the thing on it.

02:01:34.985 --> 02:01:39.250
MATT: There is 30 feet between them, yes.

02:01:39.250 --> 02:01:44.451
MARISHA: A 30 foot long spell could hit both of
them, correct?

02:01:44.451 --> 02:01:52.495
MATT: A 30 foot long spell could-- It could only
hit one. It's 30 feet between them.

02:01:52.495 --> 02:02:00.586
MARISHA: Okay. But this guy-- oh, damn it. What
about this guy and this guy? They're within 30

02:02:00.586 --> 02:02:02.108
feet, right?

02:02:02.108 --> 02:02:07.993
MATT: 35 between them. These two, there is
definitely.

02:02:07.993 --> 02:02:19.691
MARISHA: Actually, yeah, let me do that. I am
going to cast a Tidal Wave right here and I'm

02:02:19.691 --> 02:02:28.337
going to go outward in this direction, and it's
ten foot wide and 30 foot long, so let me back up

02:02:28.337 --> 02:02:29.768
a little bit out of it.

02:02:29.768 --> 02:02:31.787
MATT: So it's ten feet wide, and it'll go (rushing
water) like that, you mean?

02:02:31.787 --> 02:02:32.752
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:02:32.752 --> 02:02:34.254
MATT: Okay, so you back up to there?

02:02:34.254 --> 02:02:35.340
MARISHA: Yes.

02:02:35.340 --> 02:02:42.736
MATT: All right. Okay, dexterity save on each of
them. Dexterity save on the first one.

02:02:42.736 --> 02:02:46.488
MARISHA: Since it's water, do they have
disadvantage?

02:02:46.488 --> 02:02:55.373
MATT: No, not for the saving throw. The first one
does make the saving throw, however, that is a 19

02:02:55.373 --> 02:03:02.370
plus three, so 22. On a success, it takes half as
much damage and isn't knocked prone, so it takes

02:03:02.370 --> 02:03:04.521
half. The other one, however, does fail.

02:03:04.521 --> 02:03:06.756
MARISHA: Do they take more damage because it's
water?

02:03:06.756 --> 02:03:08.877
MATT: How much is in the spell?

02:03:08.877 --> 02:03:10.414
MARISHA: It does 4d8 damage.

02:03:10.414 --> 02:03:12.561
MATT: Right, go ahead and roll that. I'd say, how
many gallons would that be?

02:03:12.561 --> 02:03:14.335
That's a shit-ton of gallons.

02:03:14.335 --> 02:03:25.996
MARISHA: Ooh, that's good. 12 plus eight is 20,
plus another eight is 28. Math.

02:03:25.996 --> 02:03:28.961
TALIESIN: That's a d8 there.

02:03:28.961 --> 02:03:39.605
MATT: 14. Okay, so that's 14 and 28. I'd say that
Tidal Wave, how many gallons of water would we say

02:03:39.605 --> 02:03:40.905
each one of those is?

02:03:40.905 --> 02:03:42.318
MARISHA: It's 30 foot tall.

02:03:42.318 --> 02:03:45.013
MATT: Well, it's ten foot tall, ten foot wide, so
that's...

02:03:45.013 --> 02:03:48.149
MARISHA: And 30 feet long.

02:03:48.149 --> 02:03:51.593
TALIESIN: Four gallons, easily.

02:03:51.593 --> 02:03:55.182
MATT: I'd say we're looking at close to 50 gallons
of water, right?

02:03:55.182 --> 02:03:57.467
TALIESIN: Probably way more than 50 gallons.

02:03:57.467 --> 02:03:59.294
LAURA: That's a lot of gallons, for sure.

02:03:59.294 --> 02:04:00.769
CHRIS: I think it's like a million gallons.

02:04:00.769 --> 02:04:03.001
SAM: Somewhere between 50 and a million.

02:04:03.001 --> 02:04:05.360
MARISHA: Why didn't we switch to metric?

02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:07.265
TALIESIN: It would be a few hundred gallons of
water.

02:04:07.265 --> 02:04:13.496
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this, for the
width of it and the space you had to pass it

02:04:13.496 --> 02:04:19.508
through, we'll say roughly 60 gallons of water
passes through each of these elementals. Water

02:04:19.508 --> 02:04:23.119
susceptibility, for every five feet the elemental
moves in water, or for every gallon of water

02:04:23.119 --> 02:04:27.658
splashed on it, it takes one point of cold damage,
so they both take an additional 60 points of

02:04:27.658 --> 02:04:33.338
damage. Which destroys both of the elementals.

02:04:33.338 --> 02:04:36.535
LAURA: Fuck yeah! Do that again, Keyleth!

02:04:36.535 --> 02:04:37.869
MARISHA: Okay, I will!

02:04:37.869 --> 02:04:39.414
TALIESIN: Again, again!

02:04:39.414 --> 02:04:43.964
MATT: So Keyleth, you have more movement still, if
you want to move somewhere.

02:04:43.964 --> 02:04:50.731
MARISHA: Oh! I'll scootch up a bit, start moving
towards...

02:04:50.731 --> 02:04:52.331
MATT: There?

02:04:52.331 --> 02:04:53.641
MARISHA: That's good, that works.

02:04:53.641 --> 02:04:56.938
MATT: Okay. That brings us to Grog, you're up.

02:04:56.938 --> 02:05:03.519
TRAVIS: I would like to rush up where Scanlan is,
and attack that little guy on the ground there.

02:05:03.519 --> 02:05:04.668
MATT: Right there?

02:05:04.668 --> 02:05:06.199
SAM: I'm the little guy on the ground.

02:05:06.199 --> 02:05:11.441
TRAVIS: No, not you, the other guy that's next to
him. And can I use a reckless attack--

02:05:11.441 --> 02:05:13.689
MATT: Are you raging first, or are you--

02:05:13.689 --> 02:05:19.395
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, raging. I would like to rage. And
then use reckless attack against him!

02:05:19.395 --> 02:05:21.732
MATT: All right, so you got two attacks, reckless
attack.

02:05:21.732 --> 02:05:25.697
TRAVIS: 24?

02:05:25.697 --> 02:05:27.302
MATT: 24 hits.

02:05:27.302 --> 02:05:31.227
TRAVIS: 23.

02:05:31.227 --> 02:05:32.503
MATT: 23 hits.

02:05:32.503 --> 02:05:39.217
TRAVIS: Awesome. 18 on the first one.

02:05:39.217 --> 02:05:40.462
MATT: Nice.

02:05:40.462 --> 02:05:46.995
TRAVIS: And 23.

02:05:46.995 --> 02:05:52.487
MATT: 23, nice. All right, so as you rush past,
looking over at the cooled rock that's starting to

02:05:52.487 --> 02:05:57.472
crack, and bits of steam vents are starting to
push through underneath your feet, Scanlan. The

02:05:57.472 --> 02:06:00.460
area you're standing on isn't very sturdy, you're
probably going to want to move pretty soon.

02:06:00.460 --> 02:06:08.088
However, you see this barreling form of pure anger
and blade come rushing past as Grog slams into the

02:06:08.088 --> 02:06:15.543
salamander twice with his blade. That fails first
constitution, and fails second. So you gain plus

02:06:15.543 --> 02:06:18.574
two strength, salamander loses two strength.

02:06:18.574 --> 02:06:19.974
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:06:19.974 --> 02:06:31.633
MATT: However, because you've taken... With each
strike within melee of the salamander's heated

02:06:31.633 --> 02:06:38.068
body, it's so intense by its proximity that you
suffer six points of fire damage from the first

02:06:38.068 --> 02:06:39.402
melee attack against you.

02:06:39.402 --> 02:06:41.039
TRAVIS: She gave me resistance, so halved to
three?

02:06:41.039 --> 02:06:42.021
MATT: Halved to two.

02:06:42.021 --> 02:06:43.042
TRAVIS: Halved to two.

02:06:43.042 --> 02:06:45.738
MATT: The other one would be 12, so you take six.

02:06:45.738 --> 02:06:46.914
TRAVIS: Eight total.

02:06:46.914 --> 02:06:53.442
MATT: Total of eight fire damage just from
slamming and attacking this salamander. All

02:06:53.442 --> 02:07:00.140
righty, that brings us to the very end. It is now
the salamander's turn. After being hacked twice by

02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:06.865
you, Grog, it turns around, takes its trident in
both hands, looks at you with this horrible snarl.

02:07:06.865 --> 02:07:13.187
You can see now these glistening, almost ruby-like
sharp teeth in its wide grin. (snarl) These long

02:07:13.187 --> 02:07:19.647
catfish-like tendrils that waft off its face as it
slams down the spear towards you.

02:07:19.647 --> 02:07:21.734
TRAVIS: Oh, you brought a fork to a sword fight.

02:07:21.734 --> 02:07:26.426
MATT: That is going to be a 23 to hit.

02:07:26.426 --> 02:07:27.871
TRAVIS: Oh shit, that hits.

02:07:27.871 --> 02:07:32.394
MATT: You take 12 points of piercing damage.

02:07:32.394 --> 02:07:33.444
TRAVIS: Halved.

02:07:33.444 --> 02:07:39.188
MATT: Halved to six. And it's going to also turn
around and its tail, its long snake tail (whoosh)

02:07:39.188 --> 02:07:43.583
whips you. That is going to be an 18 to hit.

02:07:43.583 --> 02:07:45.217
TRAVIS: That misses!

02:07:45.217 --> 02:07:49.634
MATT: It misses, all righty. The tail comes
towards you, and you knock it out of the way with

02:07:49.634 --> 02:07:56.395
Craven Edge. That will end its turn. Top of the
round, I'm going to make a roll for the

02:07:56.395 --> 02:08:04.075
consistency of the currently cooled lava pool. It
maintains. However, you feel your

02:08:04.075 --> 02:08:05.713
feet cracking beneath--

02:08:05.713 --> 02:08:07.203
SAM: I think I'll stay.

02:08:07.203 --> 02:08:11.454
TRAVIS: Feels nice here. Maybe a timeshare.

02:08:11.454 --> 02:08:17.280
MATT: This efreet-- let me look at the logistics
of this spell now, because--

02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:20.025
TRAVIS: It's pissed off in a ball.

02:08:20.025 --> 02:08:21.607
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, this spell is awful.

02:08:21.607 --> 02:08:23.409
SAM: It can't do anything.

02:08:23.409 --> 02:08:25.938
MATT: It is enclosed for the duration, up to a
minute.

02:08:25.938 --> 02:08:31.825
LIAM: Sorry, Matt. Sorry, Matt.

02:08:31.825 --> 02:08:34.395
TRAVIS: He's like, first the beholder, now my
flame genie.

02:08:34.395 --> 02:08:38.361
MATT: It's pushing against, and it takes these two
flame balls it conjures and throws them out

02:08:38.361 --> 02:08:42.226
towards you guys. They just go (impacts) against
the sphere and then go out, and it's just

02:08:42.226 --> 02:08:47.214
(growling). It's really, really pissed off. It
can't do anything.

02:08:47.214 --> 02:08:51.307
CHRIS: (singing) Like a genie in a bottle. Got to
rub me the right way.

02:08:51.307 --> 02:08:55.078
LIAM: Can we all collectively look up at him, look
sad, and go, aw.

02:08:55.078 --> 02:08:58.996
TALIESIN: I'm looking forward to rolling it back
through the rift.

02:08:58.996 --> 02:09:03.459
MARISHA: Oh my god, can we do that? Like a hamster
ball.

02:09:03.459 --> 02:09:10.657
MATT: All right. Ending its turn, because it can't
do anything, Vax, you're up.

02:09:10.657 --> 02:09:18.985
LIAM: All right, I'm going to scoot up right in
front of Keyleth on the edge of the frozen-over

02:09:18.985 --> 02:09:23.432
pool of lava, but I'm not going to stand on it.
And I'm going to chuck three daggers at the

02:09:23.432 --> 02:09:25.225
salamander in front of Grog.

02:09:25.225 --> 02:09:26.636
MATT: Okay. Right there, about?

02:09:26.636 --> 02:09:32.082
LIAM: Right in front of her. Between her and the--
yeah. There. One, two, three to the salamander.

02:09:32.082 --> 02:09:33.490
MATT: Go for it.

02:09:33.490 --> 02:09:43.219
LIAM: 21. Then 25. And then 21.

02:09:43.219 --> 02:09:46.291
MATT: Okay, all three hit.

02:09:46.291 --> 02:09:51.568
LIAM: All right, and because he's flanked by Grog,
the first one gets sneak attack damage. Two plus

02:09:51.568 --> 02:10:02.988
eight, 14, 16, 17, 22, 23, 25, 31 for the first.

02:10:02.988 --> 02:10:04.131
MATT: Nice.

02:10:04.131 --> 02:10:09.456
LIAM: And then ten for the second and eight for
the third.

02:10:09.456 --> 02:10:16.069
MATT: All right. Good to know. (whoosh) As you
jump in front of the way of Keyleth, you unleash

02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:21.699
all three daggers in rapid succession, each one
finding its mark (impacts) into the body of the

02:10:21.699 --> 02:10:27.427
now profusely bleeding salamander. You can see now
streaks of its own blood are pouring down, boiling

02:10:27.427 --> 02:10:31.665
on contact with air, the significant difference in
temperature from the exterior and its actual

02:10:31.665 --> 02:10:35.734
interior body causing it to change from a liquid
to a gas.

02:10:35.734 --> 02:10:37.337
TRAVIS: That's our rogue.

02:10:37.337 --> 02:10:38.481
MATT: End your turn?

02:10:38.481 --> 02:10:41.342
LIAM: I look over my shoulder at Keyleth like a
dumb schmuck for a second, and then back at the

02:10:41.342 --> 02:10:42.456
salamander.

02:10:42.456 --> 02:10:44.766
MATT: Okay. Vex, you're up.

02:10:44.766 --> 02:10:47.921
LAURA: Okay. Am I hiding? Am I hidden?

02:10:47.921 --> 02:10:57.928
MATT: You can roll a stealth check. A hide action
is a hide action. As a rogue, do you have the--

02:10:57.928 --> 02:11:00.666
LAURA: What is that number?

02:11:00.666 --> 02:11:04.038
MATT: I don't know what number that is.

02:11:04.038 --> 02:11:06.510
LAURA: It's completely smooshed off of the dice!

02:11:06.510 --> 02:11:08.488
LIAM: That means that existence is about to end.

02:11:08.488 --> 02:11:10.138
LAURA: There's literally--

02:11:10.138 --> 02:11:12.738
LIAM: Just roll this. Roll another one.

02:11:12.738 --> 02:11:17.992
MATT: Technically, you do not have cunning action
yet, that's a 2nd-level rogue ability, so you

02:11:17.992 --> 02:11:19.245
would use your action to hide.

02:11:19.245 --> 02:11:21.379
LAURA: But I had my skirmisher stealth.

02:11:21.379 --> 02:11:24.884
MATT: If you go from hide to hide you can do that,
but you are not hidden at the

02:11:24.884 --> 02:11:26.373
beginning of the round.

02:11:26.373 --> 02:11:29.167
LIAM: It's a rookie rogue mistake. It happens in
the beginning.

02:11:29.167 --> 02:11:31.666
LAURA: Yeah. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. All
right, then I'm just going to...

02:11:31.666 --> 02:11:34.196
LIAM: At the higher levels you mess up the
assassinate thing.

02:11:34.196 --> 02:11:40.622
LAURA: Everything's a concentration thing, so I'm
just going to lightning arrow the giant fire guy.

02:11:40.622 --> 02:11:41.528
MATT: Right there?

02:11:41.528 --> 02:11:42.354
LAURA: Yeah.

02:11:42.354 --> 02:11:43.624
MATT: Go for it. Roll for attack.

02:11:43.624 --> 02:11:48.832
LAURA: Okay. 30!

02:11:48.832 --> 02:11:50.712
MATT: That'll hit.

02:11:50.712 --> 02:11:52.474
SAM: That'll hit anything.

02:11:52.474 --> 02:11:57.977
LIAM: She just hit a sparrow on a paraglider.

02:11:57.977 --> 02:12:00.013
LAURA: That's 4d8 lightning damage on a hit.

02:12:00.013 --> 02:12:02.356
MATT: Correct, yep.

02:12:02.356 --> 02:12:11.693
LIAM: Oh. Well, half good, half bad.

02:12:11.693 --> 02:12:15.663
LAURA: 18. That's it.

02:12:15.663 --> 02:12:17.326
MATT: 18 points of lightning damage?

02:12:17.326 --> 02:12:18.329
LAURA: Yeah.

02:12:18.329 --> 02:12:21.675
MATT: All right. So as you turn around the side of
the tree, releasing the arrow. As it goes through

02:12:21.675 --> 02:12:26.583
the air, streaking, it suddenly bursts into an
arcing bit of energy (crackling energy), a bolt of

02:12:26.583 --> 02:12:31.563
lightning that strikes into and begins to spill
around the insides of the elemental. You can see

02:12:31.563 --> 02:12:34.126
it shakes it off as the energy disperses.

02:12:34.126 --> 02:12:39.635
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to use my bonus action to
hide then, with the skirmisher's thing. For my

02:12:39.635 --> 02:12:41.828
skirmisher stealth, I can use a bonus action to
hide.

02:12:41.828 --> 02:12:45.028
MATT: I'm pretty sure you have to... If you go
from hiding to hiding, you can do it.

02:12:45.028 --> 02:12:48.259
LAURA: You told me, I swear!

02:12:48.259 --> 02:12:49.890
MATT: Read the ability, read the ability!

02:12:49.890 --> 02:12:51.092
LAURA: Okay, where was it?

02:12:51.092 --> 02:12:52.312
LIAM: Right now, on the air.

02:12:52.312 --> 02:12:55.653
LAURA: Okay, where is it? I don't know where it
is. I'll find it, and then I'll find out. And then

02:12:55.653 --> 02:12:57.590
I'll roll for stealth then if it works.

02:12:57.590 --> 02:13:02.387
MATT: I'll say for the sake right now of the
distraction, go ahead and do it for now, and we'll

02:13:02.387 --> 02:13:09.311
correct it later if need be. I would rather you
have fun than not. So, what's your stealth roll?

02:13:09.311 --> 02:13:14.220
LAURA: My stealth roll is 15, it doesn't even
matter.

02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:19.178
LIAM: 15, she said 15.

02:13:19.178 --> 02:13:24.739
LAURA: It's not in the book, it's in the--

02:13:24.739 --> 02:13:28.313
MATT: No, it's in the PDF. Anyway, what did you
roll?

02:13:28.313 --> 02:13:29.411
LAURA: 15.

02:13:29.411 --> 02:13:34.762
MATT: 15, okay. Good to know. End of your turn.
This elemental creature--

02:13:34.762 --> 02:13:36.698
LIAM: Oh jeez. Here it comes.

02:13:36.698 --> 02:13:38.156
MATT: Comes up over--

02:13:38.156 --> 02:13:39.436
(yelling)

02:13:39.436 --> 02:13:41.590
LIAM: Oh, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!

02:13:41.590 --> 02:13:43.723
MARISHA: He tripped at the finish line!

02:13:43.723 --> 02:13:51.829
MATT: As another one tears out of the portal and
begins making its way here at full movement to

02:13:51.829 --> 02:13:57.624
there. This one's going to go ahead and make two
strikes towards you, Scanlan.

02:13:57.624 --> 02:13:59.495
SAM: Two attacks towards me?

02:13:59.495 --> 02:14:03.699
MATT: Yep. That's going to be 11.

02:14:03.699 --> 02:14:06.002
SAM: Is that the attack roll?

02:14:06.002 --> 02:14:12.583
MATT: The attack roll. And a natural one.
Elementals can't roll today. And you're already on

02:14:12.583 --> 02:14:16.532
fire, so its fire form won't make much of a
difference to you either way. All right, so that's

02:14:16.532 --> 02:14:22.022
going to end its turn, and the other elemental
pours in, that's the end of their round. All

02:14:22.022 --> 02:14:23.568
right, that brings us to Gern.

02:14:23.568 --> 02:14:24.933
CHRIS: Oh boy.

02:14:24.933 --> 02:14:26.840
SAM: Feel the Gern, feel the Gern.

02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:35.025
MATT: Flames are out, you push-- not Stimpy--
Coral off of you, Coral standing (groan).

02:14:35.025 --> 02:14:42.922
CHRIS: Does it count as my turn if I ask him a
question about the orb?

02:14:42.922 --> 02:14:47.159
MATT: No, you can make a quick little aside. You
have to shout it out, though.

02:14:47.159 --> 02:14:50.985
CHRIS: If I attack the genie, is it just going to
attack the orb, and then he's going to be free?

02:14:50.985 --> 02:14:54.596
SAM: Yes! I'm not looking at you, by the way.

02:14:54.596 --> 02:15:00.000
CHRIS: It really hurts, I didn't realize how much
that hurt!

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.342
SAM: Yeah, I know!

02:15:01.342 --> 02:15:10.944
CHRIS: I've learned a valuable lesson today, while
I've half-caught on fire. Can I cast some type of

02:15:10.944 --> 02:15:14.075
a mental spell through the orb to the fire genie?

02:15:14.075 --> 02:15:16.585
MATT: You can certainly try.

02:15:16.585 --> 02:15:26.197
CHRIS: Would it be too crafty if I were to cast
Modify Memory? Could I modify the fire genie's

02:15:26.197 --> 02:15:38.597
memory to forget to not kill himself? I'll take
that as a no. Can I modify the fire genie's memory

02:15:38.597 --> 02:15:45.602
into thinking that he's completed the task that he
came to this realm to complete, and that he might

02:15:45.602 --> 02:15:46.728
go home?

02:15:46.728 --> 02:15:48.367
MATT: You can certainly try.

02:15:48.367 --> 02:15:50.071
CHRIS: I'd love to try.

02:15:50.071 --> 02:15:52.891
MATT: Okay. What's the range on the spell?

02:15:52.891 --> 02:15:54.081
CHRIS: Infinity.

02:15:54.081 --> 02:15:59.774
(laughter)

02:15:59.774 --> 02:16:06.796
MATT: Modify Memory, where is it? There we go,
5th-level.

02:16:06.796 --> 02:16:08.862
TALIESIN: Oh, God, I hope this works.

02:16:08.862 --> 02:16:15.446
MATT: It's a 30-foot range, so you're going to
have to get a lot closer. You're getting up from

02:16:15.446 --> 02:16:18.758
prone, which is half your movement, so you only
have 15 more feet you can move, so you wouldn't be

02:16:18.758 --> 02:16:20.496
able to even get into range.

02:16:20.496 --> 02:16:31.386
CHRIS: Oh, shit, I can't cast Modify Memory
anyway, I've already cast two spells

02:16:31.386 --> 02:16:33.785
like that today.

02:16:33.785 --> 02:16:38.337
MATT: That's true, Cone of Cold. You're out of
fifth level.

02:16:38.337 --> 02:16:46.730
CHRIS: So which way-- is there a chain of people? I
see a couple right there.

02:16:46.730 --> 02:16:50.677
MARISHA: Here's a laser pointer if you need it.

02:16:50.677 --> 02:16:55.261
CHRIS: Thank you. This guy's new, right?

02:16:55.261 --> 02:16:58.629
MATT: Yeah, and this guy hasn't been touched
really, except for her lightning arrow.

02:16:58.629 --> 02:17:05.407
CHRIS: Oh, I can shoot lightning breath, right?

02:17:05.407 --> 02:17:06.951
MATT: You can, yeah.

02:17:06.951 --> 02:17:12.192
CHRIS: Should I shoot at this guy or this guy?

02:17:12.192 --> 02:17:17.894
SAM: Well, the guy next to me might hit me, but
whatever!

02:17:17.894 --> 02:17:28.083
CHRIS: I'll throw some lightning breath at this
person right here.

02:17:28.083 --> 02:17:33.477
MATT: Okay, as you stand up and dust off yourself,
your fantastic zipper-covered dance jacket,

02:17:33.477 --> 02:17:38.394
brushing it off with your hands, you lumber
forward to the outskirts of this newly cracking

02:17:38.394 --> 02:17:43.225
rock crust that once was a lava pool and will soon
be once again, inhale. As you guys look around,

02:17:43.225 --> 02:17:48.352
you see this glow, this blue crackling blow-- glow
on the inside of his mouth. The blow is how he got

02:17:48.352 --> 02:17:50.516
to the mountain and then got inspired to shoot the
lightning.

02:17:50.516 --> 02:17:56.075
CHRIS: I'm flying high, but I can't get an
erection. I've done so much blow.

02:17:56.075 --> 02:18:00.626
MATT: Gern Blanston. Flying high, no erection.

02:18:00.626 --> 02:18:01.911
CHRIS: Sad.

02:18:01.911 --> 02:18:07.390
MATT: This crackling electric energy in the back
of his toothy mouth as he-- (snarl) releases this

02:18:07.390 --> 02:18:12.386
blast of lightning energy forward, striking into
the chest of the fire elemental that freshly

02:18:12.386 --> 02:18:15.808
stepped out of the portal. What's the saving throw
DC on that?

02:18:15.808 --> 02:18:17.016
CHRIS: 14.

02:18:17.016 --> 02:18:20.767
MATT: 14. It rolled a nine, so go ahead and roll
the damage on the breath. How much is it?

02:18:20.767 --> 02:18:22.019
CHRIS: It's 4d6.

02:18:22.019 --> 02:18:23.367
TRAVIS: Love the way you're rolling today.

02:18:23.367 --> 02:18:24.902
MATT: I'm rolling really bad tonight!

02:18:24.902 --> 02:18:29.196
CHRIS: Four, ten, 15, 16!

02:18:29.196 --> 02:18:30.432
SAM: Yeah, that's good.

02:18:30.432 --> 02:18:36.846
MATT: 16 points of lightning damage to that
elemental. (impact) It pulls back from the blast.

02:18:36.846 --> 02:18:43.646
You can see its form has to reconvene. There's a
little bit of black and gray smoke that billows

02:18:43.646 --> 02:18:49.741
out from the wound as it turns to you (snarling).
You've definitely got its attention.

02:18:49.741 --> 02:18:51.394
CHRIS: Hello!

02:18:51.394 --> 02:18:55.257
MATT: With your bonus action, would you like to do
anything with your compadres?

02:18:55.257 --> 02:19:00.252
CHRIS: Oh, right. I still have two left, don't I?

02:19:00.252 --> 02:19:01.595
MATT: Yes, you do.

02:19:01.595 --> 02:19:04.287
SAM: You do like dancing.

02:19:04.287 --> 02:19:13.182
CHRIS: I'd like to send them off to start dancing
just to the left of this gentleman right here.

02:19:13.182 --> 02:19:19.197
Just to distract him a little bit, because I seem
to have caught his attention, so I'd like to start

02:19:19.197 --> 02:19:27.647
a little dance party right there. This fellow
right here, the zombie, can do a little break

02:19:27.647 --> 02:19:36.928
dancing, and then the skeleton can do a bit of the
bird, and then maybe the worm.

02:19:36.928 --> 02:19:43.535
MATT: All right. As the skeleton leaps down into
the worm (crash), just flat laid out, cracking

02:19:43.535 --> 02:19:45.531
part of its pelvis...

02:19:45.531 --> 02:19:47.950
CHRIS: Dancing without music.

02:19:47.950 --> 02:19:50.831
MATT: Yep. No music whatsoever.

02:19:50.831 --> 02:19:59.404
CHRIS: Is the zombie like (zombie groaning). The
tip of his arm falls off at the ulna.

02:19:59.404 --> 02:20:01.483
TALIESIN: Pop and lock! Pop and lock!

02:20:01.483 --> 02:20:06.564
MATT: All right. I'm going to go ahead and--

02:20:06.564 --> 02:20:12.046
CHRIS: These guys are great!

02:20:12.046 --> 02:20:16.122
MATT: I'm going to ask you to go ahead and roll a
performance check.

02:20:16.122 --> 02:20:18.954
SAM: We never do those!

02:20:18.954 --> 02:20:21.962
LAURA: I feel really bad that I killed Carol now.

02:20:21.962 --> 02:20:26.640
MARISHA: Oh, that was almost bad.

02:20:26.640 --> 02:20:27.982
TALIESIN: Wait, plus, plus--

02:20:27.982 --> 02:20:29.514
SAM: Oh, you have inspiration!

02:20:29.514 --> 02:20:30.509
MARISHA: You do!

02:20:30.509 --> 02:20:31.403
LAURA: Use it!

02:20:31.403 --> 02:20:32.409
SAM: Use a d10!

02:20:32.409 --> 02:20:33.483
LIAM: This is the time.

02:20:33.483 --> 02:20:37.767
CHRIS: Oh. So seven, plus performance plus one,
eight, and then a d10.

02:20:37.767 --> 02:20:39.658
LIAM: Roll the d10, add it.

02:20:39.658 --> 02:20:42.216
CHRIS: Jesus Christ. Ten.

02:20:42.216 --> 02:20:48.433
MATT: Ten. Trying to recall and hum the song that
Scanlan once sang to you, naught but ten minutes

02:20:48.433 --> 02:20:54.318
before, you don't recall it much at all, and it
comes out (tuneless humming).

02:20:54.318 --> 02:20:58.230
CHRIS: (singing) Gern, Gern, It's Gern. It's Gern
time!

02:20:58.230 --> 02:21:00.212
SAM: Pitchy, little pitchy. Flat.

02:21:00.212 --> 02:21:02.065
CHRIS: (singing) It's Gern, time to Gern!

02:21:02.065 --> 02:21:03.451
SAM: Well, now you're sharp.

02:21:03.451 --> 02:21:07.072
CHRIS: (singing) Gern it all the way. I'm doing
great!

02:21:07.072 --> 02:21:08.786
SAM: Yep, your name was in the song!

02:21:08.786 --> 02:21:13.868
CHRIS: (singing) Gern is my name and this is
definitely the song that I'm singing.

02:21:13.868 --> 02:21:20.233
MATT: It's discordant enough that on a low wisdom
save I'll say the fire elemental's next attack has

02:21:20.233 --> 02:21:30.551
disadvantage. That was the strangest round of
combat I think I've ever had in D&amp;amp;D. All right,

02:21:30.551 --> 02:21:39.300
Percy, you're up. Follow that. First, top of your
round, you take nine points of fire damage.

02:21:39.300 --> 02:21:41.189
TALIESIN: That's halved to five.

02:21:41.189 --> 02:21:45.441
LAURA: I have the skirmisher stealth! As a bonus
action at the end of your turn, you can make a

02:21:45.441 --> 02:21:48.288
dexterity (stealth) check to hide again.

02:21:48.288 --> 02:21:50.730
MATT: All right, cool, there you go. Perfect.
Wasn't sure if you had to be hidden

02:21:50.730 --> 02:21:52.338
at the top to do it.

02:21:52.338 --> 02:21:55.765
TALIESIN: I'm going to shift my Hex to the tiny
little (Irish accent) fucker. God, you've got me

02:21:55.765 --> 02:21:58.936
doing it now. Damn it. It's a plague.

02:21:58.936 --> 02:22:00.280
CHRIS: It's contagious.

02:22:00.280 --> 02:22:01.353
MATT: To which one, this guy there?

02:22:01.353 --> 02:22:02.898
TALIESIN: No no no, the one furthest from me.

02:22:02.898 --> 02:22:03.785
MATT: Right there?

02:22:03.785 --> 02:22:08.618
TALIESIN: Yeah, right there. I'll move my Hex to
him. I'm going to bust out the Bad News rifle, I'm

02:22:08.618 --> 02:22:13.077
going to sit, and I'm going to take a nice, calm,
calculated sharpshooter shot at him.

02:22:13.077 --> 02:22:15.212
MATT: All righty.

02:22:15.212 --> 02:22:20.036
TALIESIN: And Bad News just goes (click).

02:22:20.036 --> 02:22:21.317
MATT: Did you misfire?

02:22:21.317 --> 02:22:22.338
TALIESIN: I misfired.

02:22:22.338 --> 02:22:27.541
MATT: Oh no! You get down with the gun and
(click). You look at it and you can see some of

02:22:27.541 --> 02:22:30.543
the metal bowing in the centerpiece like, "That's
bad. That's bad. That's bad. That's bad!"

02:22:30.543 --> 02:22:33.657
TALIESIN: It's fine. I put it down, I pull out the
pistol, and I'm going to take a shot.

02:22:33.657 --> 02:22:38.582
MARISHA: It's hot. It's really hot. Just keep
going.

02:22:38.582 --> 02:22:40.417
TALIESIN: That was really awkward.

02:22:40.417 --> 02:22:44.353
MARISHA: Maybe the heat made you misfire.

02:22:44.353 --> 02:22:46.061
TRAVIS: Just roll the dice.

02:22:46.061 --> 02:22:47.857
LIAM: You're also 60 feet apart at the moment.

02:22:47.857 --> 02:22:51.564
TALIESIN: That's a 25 to hit.

02:22:51.564 --> 02:22:54.910
MATT: 25 hits. Sharpshooter? No.

02:22:54.910 --> 02:22:55.835
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:22:55.835 --> 02:22:57.658
MATT: That's sharpshooter? Wow. Nice roll.

02:22:57.658 --> 02:23:09.668
TALIESIN: Six, 12, 22 points of damage. And I
reload, and that's my turn.

02:23:09.668 --> 02:23:14.356
MATT: That's your turn. Okay. Finishing up Percy,
that brings us to Scanlan. You're still

02:23:14.356 --> 02:23:16.199
concentrating on Otiluke's Resilient Sphere.

02:23:16.199 --> 02:23:17.322
SAM: Oh, yes I am.

02:23:17.322 --> 02:23:18.779
LIAM: The gnome has got this.

02:23:18.779 --> 02:23:21.439
SAM: Hey, how's that stuff under my feet?

02:23:21.439 --> 02:23:23.910
MATT: Pretty rough. You're going to want to step
off of it very soon, probably.

02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:25.835
SAM: I'm going to step into it.

02:23:25.835 --> 02:23:28.664
LIAM: Love you, Scanlan.

02:23:28.664 --> 02:23:31.870
SAM: So I can fire a Lightning Bolt and hit both
of those guys.

02:23:31.870 --> 02:23:33.641
MATT: Oh, snap. Okay.

02:23:33.641 --> 02:23:36.776
SAM: And yeah, that's it. That'll be my--

02:23:36.776 --> 02:23:38.449
MATT: You can still move after that.

02:23:38.449 --> 02:23:41.222
SAM: Oh, good! Okay, good, thank you for saving
me.

02:23:41.222 --> 02:23:43.058
MATT: So the bolt arcs past, go ahead.

02:23:43.058 --> 02:23:44.571
CHRIS: I saw that, it was great!

02:23:44.571 --> 02:23:48.173
SAM: Oh, for once! Thank you! Thank you, it was
for you!

02:23:48.173 --> 02:23:49.769
CHRIS: Much appreciated!

02:23:49.769 --> 02:23:53.353
MATT: Five, no. And a 12 plus three, 15, no. Both
fail their saving throw.

02:23:53.353 --> 02:23:54.823
SAM: Okay, so 8d6?

02:23:54.823 --> 02:24:00.657
MATT: 8d6 points of lightning damage to both of
them. It's a wonderful display, Gern.

02:24:00.657 --> 02:24:03.693
LIAM: I ship Scanlan and Gern.

02:24:03.693 --> 02:24:05.694
CHRIS: Shh, guys, please.

02:24:05.694 --> 02:24:08.129
SAM: 33.

02:24:08.129 --> 02:24:09.736
MATT: 33, nice roll.

02:24:09.736 --> 02:24:16.777
CHRIS: Oh, that Lightning Bolt was so big. And
wide!

02:24:16.777 --> 02:24:19.637
SAM: It's the width that really does it.

02:24:19.637 --> 02:24:23.077
CHRIS: It really does. It's not so much the
length.

02:24:23.077 --> 02:24:25.007
TALIESIN: It's the girth of Gern.

02:24:25.007 --> 02:24:31.640
SAM: And I will re-inspire Gern. Oh, wait, you're
still injured, aren't you?

02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:32.550
CHRIS: Yeah.

02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:33.751
SAM: I will heal Gern.

02:24:33.751 --> 02:24:34.467
CHRIS: Please.

02:24:34.467 --> 02:24:39.288
SAM: With another Healing Word. This time at
third level.

02:24:39.288 --> 02:24:43.897
MATT: Technically, a second spell can only be as
high as second level. You used two spells in one

02:24:43.897 --> 02:24:44.690
round.

02:24:44.690 --> 02:24:46.113
LIAM: It's still very romantic, though.

02:24:46.113 --> 02:24:50.981
SAM: Okay, I'll do a 2nd-level Healing Word, and I
will sing to him, because I'm running out of

02:24:50.981 --> 02:24:58.372
things that rhyme with his name: (singing) Gern
down for what! (EDM beat) Gern down for what!

02:24:58.372 --> 02:25:01.014
That's it.

02:25:01.014 --> 02:25:04.032
CHRIS: Might I remind you I am unable to get an
erection at the moment?

02:25:04.032 --> 02:25:09.861
MATT: However, in spite of that, the blue pill
does give you ten additional hit points healed.

02:25:09.861 --> 02:25:13.512
LAURA: Did the skeleton and the zombie start
dancing better, after that?

02:25:13.512 --> 02:25:17.034
MATT: Yeah, it actually does pick up their pace a
little bit now that they have a backtrack.

02:25:17.034 --> 02:25:21.197
CHRIS: What is the elemental doing while they're
dancing?

02:25:21.197 --> 02:25:26.062
MATT: Well, it's currently being surrounded by a
swirl of Hex shadow and looking around very

02:25:26.062 --> 02:25:28.563
confused and wondering why it got up in the
morning.

02:25:28.563 --> 02:25:30.618
TALIESIN: Where did the glow sticks come from?

02:25:30.618 --> 02:25:32.113
MATT: Do you want to move out?

02:25:32.113 --> 02:25:33.174
SAM: And I can move out?

02:25:33.174 --> 02:25:34.063
MATT: Yeah, you can.

02:25:34.063 --> 02:25:35.108
SAM: Will he take a swipe at me?

02:25:35.108 --> 02:25:37.919
MATT: It will yes, but better than possibly
falling in.

02:25:37.919 --> 02:25:39.942
SAM: I'm still on fire, right?

02:25:39.942 --> 02:25:44.434
MATT: Yes, you are. Takes an action to put it out,
though, unfortunately. That's 18 plus six. I

02:25:44.434 --> 02:25:51.891
believe that does hit you. You take 12 points of
fire damage.

02:25:51.891 --> 02:25:54.362
SAM: Plus whatever I was on fire for.

02:25:54.362 --> 02:25:56.032
MATT: You already took that damage earlier.

02:25:56.032 --> 02:25:58.820
SAM: Oh, I did? At the beginning of my turn.

02:25:58.820 --> 02:26:01.516
MATT: Yeah, I rolled for that already, you take
nine points of fire damage, I think it was.

02:26:01.516 --> 02:26:02.792
SAM: Oh, okay, plus 12?

02:26:02.792 --> 02:26:10.122
MATT: Plus 12. If I'm wrong, whatever, it's fine.
All right. That ends your turn, Scanlan. Keyleth.

02:26:10.122 --> 02:26:15.394
MARISHA: So we have these two assholes in front of
us.

02:26:15.394 --> 02:26:18.573
LIAM: My name is Vax.

02:26:18.573 --> 02:26:25.544
MARISHA: Well, depends on the day. So, that guy is
still alive too, yeah?

02:26:25.544 --> 02:26:29.905
MATT: Yeah, all three of these guys are alive. And
this guy's in a hamster ball.

02:26:29.905 --> 02:26:32.352
LAURA: Being pissed!

02:26:32.352 --> 02:26:34.987
TALIESIN: It's just like a weather balloon.

02:26:34.987 --> 02:26:37.089
MATT: Yeah it's a rover just holding him in
place.

02:26:37.089 --> 02:26:46.287
MARISHA: I'm going to Tidal Wave again. Tidal
Wave! Right here, this way, fucking

02:26:46.287 --> 02:26:47.635
with these two guys.

02:26:47.635 --> 02:26:49.541
MATT: All righty, let's go ahead and roll some
saving throws on their end.

02:26:49.541 --> 02:26:51.399
('The Prisoner' theme starts playing)

02:26:51.399 --> 02:26:53.686
TALIESIN: Thank you, thank you.

02:26:53.686 --> 02:26:59.699
MATT: Yeah. Six and an eight, both fail. Who is
number one?

02:26:59.699 --> 02:27:03.579
CHRIS: I am not a number, I'm a free man!

02:27:03.579 --> 02:27:09.654
MATT: So good, so good. The original one, not the
remake. Patrick McGoohan. Two failed saving

02:27:09.654 --> 02:27:11.698
throws, go ahead and roll damage on that.

02:27:11.698 --> 02:27:17.110
MARISHA: It's really good, I'm warning you right
now. Seven and seven is 14 plus another six,

02:27:17.110 --> 02:27:25.617
brings me to 20, plus eight, 28, again. That's
what I had last time right? 28.

02:27:25.617 --> 02:27:26.708
LIAM: Kismet.

02:27:26.708 --> 02:27:30.783
MATT: 28 points of water damage, plus the
additional blast of water gallons surging through

02:27:30.783 --> 02:27:35.617
them, manages to completely scatter both these
guys.

02:27:35.617 --> 02:27:40.867
TALIESIN: We actually had a Critter tweet us how
much water.

02:27:40.867 --> 02:27:42.514
MATT: How much water would be in a Tidal Wave?

02:27:42.514 --> 02:27:44.040
TALIESIN: 225 gallons.

02:27:44.040 --> 02:27:45.802
MATT: Oh, there is no way they're surviving that.

02:27:45.802 --> 02:27:50.457
MARISHA: And then technically in Tidal Wave it
says the water then spreads out across the ground

02:27:50.457 --> 02:27:54.881
in all directions, extinguishing unprotected
flames in the area within 30 feet of it.

02:27:54.881 --> 02:28:00.706
MATT: Unprotected flames are different than lava
pools. Water doesn't cool it, it just evaporates.

02:28:00.706 --> 02:28:02.347
TALIESIN: We've got steam.

02:28:02.347 --> 02:28:06.016
MATT: You do. You have a very heavy cloud of steam
now, that is (steam sound) to the side. The

02:28:06.016 --> 02:28:12.295
dancing skeleton and zombie are now just these
shadows lit in this cool music video light now as

02:28:12.295 --> 02:28:13.773
they're (groan) dancing.

02:28:13.773 --> 02:28:16.941
LIAM: As if this were a Telltale game, at the top
of the screen it says,

02:28:16.941 --> 02:28:18.809
'Keyleth will remember this'.

02:28:18.809 --> 02:28:26.889
MATT: Exactly. Tidal Wave on fire elementals is
nasty, man.

02:28:26.889 --> 02:28:31.579
("Thriller" starts playing)

02:28:31.579 --> 02:28:33.774
MARISHA: Can I use my bonus action--

02:28:33.774 --> 02:28:46.561
MATT: Perfect. This is happening, guys. Is that
the rest of your turn, Keyleth? Do you want to

02:28:46.561 --> 02:28:47.813
move somewhere?

02:28:47.813 --> 02:28:48.779
MARISHA: Question.

02:28:48.779 --> 02:28:50.722
MATT: Yes, what's your question?

02:28:50.722 --> 02:28:55.229
MARISHA: Can I theoretically cast a Grasping Vine
coming out of the hellmouth?

02:28:55.229 --> 02:28:59.256
MATT: No, Grasping Vine is a 4th-level spell, I
believe, and as a bonus action you can't do

02:28:59.256 --> 02:29:01.179
anything more than a 2nd-level spell in the same
round.

02:29:01.179 --> 02:29:07.183
MARISHA: Fuck, never mind. Actually, no, that's
not true. I will take my bonus Healing Word to

02:29:07.183 --> 02:29:12.291
toss another Healing Word, just 1st-level, over to
Gern.

02:29:12.291 --> 02:29:14.633
MATT: Everyone's keeping the dance master alive
over there.

02:29:14.633 --> 02:29:16.123
CHRIS: Oh my god, amazing.

02:29:16.123 --> 02:29:22.933
MARISHA: So you heal eight points, Gern.

02:29:22.933 --> 02:29:25.578
MATT: Eight points of healing to you, Gern.

02:29:25.578 --> 02:29:26.883
SAM: He's gone.

02:29:26.883 --> 02:29:28.592
MATT: We can't save him. Grog, you're up.

02:29:28.592 --> 02:29:35.130
TRAVIS: I use another reckless attack and I make
the first strike against the guy right in front of me.

02:29:35.130 --> 02:29:36.514
MATT: Go for it.

02:29:36.514 --> 02:29:40.851
TRAVIS: Jesus. Better. 14.

02:29:40.851 --> 02:29:43.954
MATT: 14 misses, unfortunately.

02:29:43.954 --> 02:29:44.979
TRAVIS: Damn it.

02:29:44.979 --> 02:29:47.342
MATT: Are these with great weapon master?

02:29:47.342 --> 02:29:56.438
TRAVIS: No, just reckless attack. This one is with
great weapon master. Nope. Better. 16 plus nine is

02:29:56.438 --> 02:29:57.907
25, minus five is 20.

02:29:57.907 --> 02:29:59.000
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:05.842
TRAVIS: Yahtzee! Five, ten, 18, 28!

02:30:05.842 --> 02:30:12.426
MATT: 28 points of damage, okay. This time, as you
release the first blow of your sword forward, he

02:30:12.426 --> 02:30:16.138
catches it in the blade of the trident and
deflects it off to the side, slamming it into the

02:30:16.138 --> 02:30:20.171
ground, almost pinning the weapon for a second. He
gets up in your face and grins (snarls), and the

02:30:20.171 --> 02:30:24.235
actual breath that emanates from its teeth begins
to burn and singe the edge of your beard hairs.

02:30:24.235 --> 02:30:31.728
That infuriates you, and you lift up Craven Edge
between the blades of the trident. It's a test of

02:30:31.728 --> 02:30:36.021
strength as you both tense, and eventually you
lift it back, and with the backswing, slash him

02:30:36.021 --> 02:30:41.851
right across his chest with that blow. You see a
strike of extremely hot, hot blood splatter

02:30:41.851 --> 02:30:45.441
across, (sizzling), singe the front of your chest
and leave little burn marks on you.

02:30:45.441 --> 02:30:46.505
SAM: Yes!

02:30:46.505 --> 02:30:47.694
TRAVIS: Like freckles.

02:30:47.694 --> 02:30:49.346
LIAM: You don't want to fuck with his beard!

02:30:49.346 --> 02:30:53.003
MATT: He does make the save.

02:30:53.003 --> 02:30:54.274
CHRIS: She has a name.

02:30:54.274 --> 02:30:58.077
LIAM: Sorry, Laura.

02:30:58.077 --> 02:31:00.507
MATT: Well played. Does that end your turn?

02:31:00.507 --> 02:31:02.214
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's the end of my turn.

02:31:02.214 --> 02:31:03.739
LAURA: Why am I laughing at that?

02:31:03.739 --> 02:31:06.874
TRAVIS: Darling, shush.

02:31:06.874 --> 02:31:11.959
MATT: Efreet's going to start pushing against the
ball, which is going to begin to coast through the

02:31:11.959 --> 02:31:13.416
air this way.

02:31:13.416 --> 02:31:17.066
LIAM: Does he spin the globe?

02:31:17.066 --> 02:31:23.778
MATT: Just gliding through slowly.

02:31:23.778 --> 02:31:24.942
TRAVIS: Genie hamster.

02:31:24.942 --> 02:31:26.573
MATT: Yeah, that's about all he can do this turn.

02:31:26.573 --> 02:31:28.226
SAM: Sorry!

02:31:28.226 --> 02:31:31.947
MATT: No, no, it's what you do. It's what you do.
All right, Vax, you're up.

02:31:31.947 --> 02:31:37.492
LIAM: Man, all right. I'm in a good spot, I'll
just throw three more daggers at the salamander

02:31:37.492 --> 02:31:44.036
that Grog has not yet killed. First one is a
natural 20, the second one is a 13, and the third

02:31:44.036 --> 02:31:46.644
one is, aw, fuck, is a 14.

02:31:46.644 --> 02:31:53.785
MATT: Okay. Hold off on those two attacks, just in
case how much your critical sneak attack does.

02:31:53.785 --> 02:32:08.757
LIAM: Five, six, seven, eight, 12, 18, 21, 25. 25,
so you double the dice, is 56 for the first one.

02:32:08.757 --> 02:32:14.590
MATT: Okay, so as you throw the dagger, it goes
right past Grog's ear and you hear the (whoosh) of

02:32:14.590 --> 02:32:19.988
the wind as it just brushes past your face. After
you finish your backswing with Craven Edge, as the

02:32:19.988 --> 02:32:26.387
salamander creature rears back from the impact, it
looks towards you, and its eyes twitch ever so

02:32:26.387 --> 02:32:30.329
slightly to your right as it sees the incoming
blade a little too late as it (impact) right into

02:32:30.329 --> 02:32:35.673
its right eye socket. Its tongue lolls out of its
jaw as it falls onto its back, and its tail moves

02:32:35.673 --> 02:32:38.856
and twitches for a few seconds before it
eventually goes limp.

02:32:38.856 --> 02:32:41.745
TRAVIS: No, no, he's still alive! And I kick him.
Now he's dead.

02:32:41.745 --> 02:32:48.685
MATT: Grog stomps it into the ground. The
twitching stops, the salamander now destroyed.

02:32:48.685 --> 02:32:51.936
TRAVIS: Does the dagger stay in his eye socket?

02:32:51.936 --> 02:32:54.325
MATT: It's currently in the eye socket, yeah.

02:32:54.325 --> 02:32:57.633
TRAVIS: Ooh. Can I reach down and grab it?

02:32:57.633 --> 02:33:01.315
MATT: Yeah. You reach down and grab the dagger,
and as you pull it out, (poof) it turns into smoke

02:33:01.315 --> 02:33:02.369
in your hand.

02:33:02.369 --> 02:33:04.965
TRAVIS: Holy shit! I look back at Vax.

02:33:04.965 --> 02:33:07.047
LIAM: Grog, how did you do that?

02:33:07.047 --> 02:33:13.418
TRAVIS: I don't know! I think maybe I'm a magic
user now! And I start trying to cast reanimate

02:33:13.418 --> 02:33:15.659
person on the dead thing.

02:33:15.659 --> 02:33:16.691
MATT: Okay.

02:33:16.691 --> 02:33:18.119
CHRIS: That's not how you do that!

02:33:18.119 --> 02:33:19.747
TRAVIS: No, no, no, I've got to concentrate!

02:33:19.747 --> 02:33:20.843
CHRIS: All right.

02:33:20.843 --> 02:33:23.123
TRAVIS: (straining)

02:33:23.123 --> 02:33:24.127
LAURA: Hey, Scanlan!

02:33:24.127 --> 02:33:25.068
SAM: Oi!

02:33:25.068 --> 02:33:26.673
LAURA: What are we going to do with this giant
ball?

02:33:26.673 --> 02:33:31.687
SAM: We need someone to bring him down to earth.
Keyleth, can you vine him down? Or, Gern, do you

02:33:31.687 --> 02:33:33.790
have something that can move things?

02:33:33.790 --> 02:33:34.814
MARISHA: Can I--

02:33:34.814 --> 02:33:36.491
CHRIS: Go ahead.

02:33:36.491 --> 02:33:38.502
MARISHA: No, go, you first. Please, Gern.

02:33:38.502 --> 02:33:40.669
LIAM: Does anyone have a large purple hand they
could use?

02:33:40.669 --> 02:33:43.218
TALIESIN: I think he would lose--

02:33:43.218 --> 02:33:45.160
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a concentration spell.

02:33:45.160 --> 02:33:46.673
MATT: Yeah, one spell at a time.

02:33:46.673 --> 02:33:49.262
CHRIS: I thought I had some sort of a Telekinesis
spell, but I guess I don't.

02:33:49.262 --> 02:33:51.017
SAM: Chromatic Orb?

02:33:51.017 --> 02:33:52.829
MARISHA: No, that's an attack.

02:33:52.829 --> 02:33:55.387
LAURA: Can you bring it down, Keyleth?

02:33:55.387 --> 02:34:00.887
MARISHA: I can try. Can I do a Grasping Vine from
the bottom underneath of him, and see if I can?

02:34:00.887 --> 02:34:02.174
LIAM: He's over lava.

02:34:02.174 --> 02:34:03.359
SAM: He's got something!

02:34:03.359 --> 02:34:04.513
CHRIS: Oh, sorry, go ahead.

02:34:04.513 --> 02:34:07.542
MATT: What are you doing? I know what you're
doing, what are you doing?

02:34:07.542 --> 02:34:15.116
CHRIS: I could either manipulate his memory, or I
do have a flying broom.

02:34:15.116 --> 02:34:17.363
SAM: What?

02:34:17.363 --> 02:34:18.496
LIAM: Yes?

02:34:18.496 --> 02:34:19.856
CHRIS: Yes, I have a flying broom.

02:34:19.856 --> 02:34:20.965
TRAVIS: Like you do.

02:34:20.965 --> 02:34:22.990
LAURA: Are you going to bat him down like you're
sweeping the sky?

02:34:22.990 --> 02:34:25.943
CHRIS: I could fly up and gently glide him down.

02:34:25.943 --> 02:34:28.978
LAURA: How come everybody flies?

02:34:28.978 --> 02:34:31.846
MATT: Are you doing your vine as well?

02:34:31.846 --> 02:34:33.759
MARISHA: Let me see how this goes first.

02:34:33.759 --> 02:34:41.252
MATT: So, without any other command, your two
friends, Coral and Stimpy, are still over there

02:34:41.252 --> 02:34:49.038
dancing as the mist slowly dissipates from the
deluge. You pull out from the side of your little

02:34:49.038 --> 02:34:55.430
satchel there your flying broom, which is a pretty
decent, medium-sized broom, places it in the air

02:34:55.430 --> 02:35:00.308
and it rests there, slightly shifting in place.
You leap up onto it and grab onto the front as you

02:35:00.308 --> 02:35:01.974
shoot up from the side.

02:35:01.974 --> 02:35:05.233
CHRIS: Going up to catch the golden bitch!

02:35:05.233 --> 02:35:09.361
LAURA: There's flying brooms?!

02:35:09.361 --> 02:35:15.706
MATT: As you place yourself on top of Otiluke's
Resilient Sphere, placing all your weight onto it,

02:35:15.706 --> 02:35:22.710
it sinks a little bit, then it comes to a halt.
About three feet it sinks, as you're just standing

02:35:22.710 --> 02:35:23.800
on top of it.

02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:25.281
MARISHA: That's as far as it goes?

02:35:25.281 --> 02:35:27.805
MATT: What do you want to do?

02:35:27.805 --> 02:35:31.758
CHRIS: I'd like to try to cast a memory spell on
it, if possible.

02:35:31.758 --> 02:35:36.971
MATT: Okay. Well, you've already cast a 5th-level
spell twice, how many 5th-level spells can you

02:35:36.971 --> 02:35:38.091
cast per day?

02:35:38.091 --> 02:35:39.167
CHRIS: Two.

02:35:39.167 --> 02:35:41.763
MATT: Yeah, unfortunately you're out of 5th-level
slots.

02:35:41.763 --> 02:35:45.628
CHRIS: Could I cast it on you to forget that I've
already cast it twice?

02:35:45.628 --> 02:35:49.489
LIAM: Scanlan, how much time do we have with this
bubble?

02:35:49.489 --> 02:35:52.403
SAM: A minute, but about 30 seconds have gone by.

02:35:52.403 --> 02:35:55.060
MATT: Yeah, you're getting down to about the
40-second mark.

02:35:55.060 --> 02:35:57.118
TALIESIN: Can I put myself out while all of this
is happening?

02:35:57.118 --> 02:35:58.311
MATT: Yes, you can do that.

02:35:58.311 --> 02:35:59.506
SAM: Can he push down?

02:35:59.506 --> 02:36:01.865
MATT: You can jump onto it and begin to push
down.

02:36:01.865 --> 02:36:04.651
CHRIS: I'm going to push down with all my might,
to try to get him down on the ground.

02:36:04.651 --> 02:36:09.780
MATT: You leap in the air and jump on it again and
as you do the orb (sinking noise) and just slowly,

02:36:09.780 --> 02:36:16.253
over the next 15 seconds shove it down to the
point where you're over the orb on the very top,

02:36:16.253 --> 02:36:19.151
as you can feel the spell about to dissipate.

02:36:19.151 --> 02:36:24.485
LIAM: Grog, Grog! Stop trying to reanimate that
thing and hit the freaking red guy into the hole!

02:36:24.485 --> 02:36:26.445
MATT: Grog, go ahead and roll an arcana check.

02:36:26.445 --> 02:36:28.777
SAM: Oh, he's the best at arcana.

02:36:28.777 --> 02:36:31.696
LIAM: 20. Get it. Get it. Reanimate that fucker.

02:36:31.696 --> 02:36:32.832
TRAVIS: Six.

02:36:32.832 --> 02:36:36.171
MATT: Six. This isn't working.

02:36:36.171 --> 02:36:39.240
TRAVIS: Must be a rookie mistake.

02:36:39.240 --> 02:36:42.979
SAM: What are we trying to do, shove him back into
the hole?

02:36:42.979 --> 02:36:44.688
TALIESIN: Shove him in the hole!

02:36:44.688 --> 02:36:46.419
LIAM: Grog, shove that fucking thing in there.

02:36:46.419 --> 02:36:47.762
TRAVIS: He's over lava.

02:36:47.762 --> 02:36:50.671
LIAM: You are made of hit points!

02:36:50.671 --> 02:36:55.492
TRAVIS: All right, fuck it-- This is your thing.

02:36:55.492 --> 02:36:59.273
MARISHA: Can I do the vines from out of the
portal?

02:36:59.273 --> 02:37:03.247
MATT: No, it has to have an anchor point
somewhere.

02:37:03.247 --> 02:37:07.570
TRAVIS: All right, fuck it, now I just run, in a
rage, I run into the lava and I start shoving him

02:37:07.570 --> 02:37:11.791
straight toward the flaming vagina hole.

02:37:11.791 --> 02:37:16.290
MATT: Okay, I want you to make an athletics check.
Actually, no, this would be a full strength check.

02:37:16.290 --> 02:37:19.778
Just roll a strength check. You have advantage
because you're still raging. Although you

02:37:19.778 --> 02:37:23.707
wouldn't be raging anymore because you spent time
concentrating on the spell, you could go into a

02:37:23.707 --> 02:37:26.752
rage for this if you'd like to, spend another use
of your rage.

02:37:26.752 --> 02:37:28.328
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll use another one.

02:37:28.328 --> 02:37:39.962
MATT: Okay, you go into a rage. All right, as you
step into the lava, you suffer 26 points of fire

02:37:39.962 --> 02:37:44.243
damage from wading up to your knees in molten
rock.

02:37:44.243 --> 02:37:45.427
MARISHA: Halved.

02:37:45.427 --> 02:37:46.891
MATT: Halved because of your resistance.

02:37:46.891 --> 02:37:49.851
TRAVIS: So 12. I rolled a 22.

02:37:49.851 --> 02:37:56.295
MATT: 22. With that you, (boof), you shove the
sphere, which shifts back about halfway to there.

02:37:56.295 --> 02:38:02.155
You have to catch yourself on the side, grabbing
the broom and holding it out here as you're

02:38:02.155 --> 02:38:05.775
stepping the other direction. I want you to make
an acrobatics check.

02:38:05.775 --> 02:38:14.560
CHRIS: All right. Seven.

02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:16.395
MATT: Seven.

02:38:16.395 --> 02:38:19.039
TALIESIN: You have inspiration!

02:38:19.039 --> 02:38:20.417
SAM: Nope. He used it.

02:38:20.417 --> 02:38:26.359
MATT: As you (slipping noise) slip off the top of
the sphere, begin to fall back toward the lava

02:38:26.359 --> 02:38:33.674
behind you, in a very Lord of the Rings Gollum
tumbling into Mount Doom type of view. (sploosh)

02:38:33.674 --> 02:38:36.485
Back first into the lava.

02:38:36.485 --> 02:38:37.843
LAURA: Oh shit.

02:38:37.843 --> 02:38:39.200
CHRIS: I feel fine.

02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:47.539
MATT: Actually, you take six points of fire
damage. Impacting-- rolled really low on that. (sploosh)

02:38:47.539 --> 02:38:55.796
You can feel the back of your scales and the flesh
on your back immediately begin to burn with

02:38:55.796 --> 02:39:00.597
horrifying pain. You're holding your broom aloft,
'cause you don't want that to go in the fire.

02:39:00.597 --> 02:39:02.519
LAURA: I run forward to try to help him out.

02:39:02.519 --> 02:39:04.281
SAM: And steal the broom.

02:39:04.281 --> 02:39:08.158
MATT: And with that, the sphere breaks.

02:39:08.158 --> 02:39:10.150
(disgruntled moans)

02:39:10.150 --> 02:39:11.841
LIAM: Crap.

02:39:11.841 --> 02:39:14.849
MARISHA: Can Keyleth run up, do I have an action?

02:39:14.849 --> 02:39:19.171
MATT: Right now we're going back to the initiative
order, since combat has re-initiated with the

02:39:19.171 --> 02:39:24.344
sphere opened. That brings us to the top. The
efreet, now freed from its sphere,

02:39:24.344 --> 02:39:25.665
is going to go first.

02:39:25.665 --> 02:39:26.607
LIAM: He's mad.

02:39:26.607 --> 02:39:30.480
MATT: He is livid. All right.

02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:34.323
TRAVIS: I just want you to know, I was trying to
free you.

02:39:34.323 --> 02:39:37.244
SAM: I don't know these people.

02:39:37.244 --> 02:39:40.056
LIAM: These assholes.

02:39:40.056 --> 02:39:43.658
TRAVIS: Can you believe how rude these people are?

02:39:43.658 --> 02:39:45.407
MATT: He's going to fly back up.

02:39:45.407 --> 02:39:47.166
(groans)

02:39:47.166 --> 02:39:58.661
MATT: Keep away. Let's see. It's going to cast
Invisibility on itself, then it vanishes from view.

02:39:58.661 --> 02:40:00.695
MARISHA: Great.

02:40:00.695 --> 02:40:04.605
SAM: As it does that, do I recognize the spell?

02:40:04.605 --> 02:40:05.824
MATT: You do.

02:40:05.824 --> 02:40:08.672
SAM: I cast Counterspell.

02:40:08.672 --> 02:40:16.597
MATT: Yes, you can. Go ahead and roll-- Oh, wait,
no, it's a 2nd-level spell. It auto-- Yeah. Yeah.

02:40:16.597 --> 02:40:17.861
Because it is a 2nd-level spell.

02:40:17.861 --> 02:40:18.953
SAM: Hi!

02:40:18.953 --> 02:40:21.298
TALIESIN: Yeah!

02:40:21.298 --> 02:40:26.665
MATT: As its form begins to vanish, Scanlan, what
do you do to counter it?

02:40:26.761 --> 02:40:33.781
SAM: I'm going to sing-- No! I'm going to distract
it with this.

02:40:33.781 --> 02:40:35.337
TALIESIN: With an app?

02:40:35.337 --> 02:40:41.357
SAM: With an app. (airhorn) (song starts) Oh, wait
that's not what I wanted to do!

02:40:41.357 --> 02:40:45.979
CHRIS: Keep going! Distract him with your morning
radio program!

02:40:45.979 --> 02:40:53.014
MATT: And that bit of chaos is just enough, as he
begins to cast his innate Invisibility spell, it

02:40:53.014 --> 02:40:59.433
looks over. "What in the-- Shit!" And loses the
spell concentration. The invisibility field

02:40:59.433 --> 02:41:05.915
vanishes, and it stands there above. All right,
that brings us to Vax.

02:41:05.915 --> 02:41:11.692
LIAM: Oh, shite. All right, I'm going to leap over
the lava pit.

02:41:11.692 --> 02:41:13.465
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

02:41:13.465 --> 02:41:21.058
LIAM: Yeah. That'll be a 28. I run up behind Grog,
and I should be within--

02:41:21.058 --> 02:41:24.179
MATT: Darting around the side there, because you
are hasted with this, so you can actually just

02:41:24.179 --> 02:41:25.543
dart around the side.

02:41:25.543 --> 02:41:28.999
LIAM: All right, right behind Grog. I should be
within 60 feet of the efreeti.

02:41:28.999 --> 02:41:29.953
MATT: Yes.

02:41:29.953 --> 02:41:31.348
LIAM: And I'll throw three daggers at it.

02:41:31.348 --> 02:41:32.296
MATT: Go for it.

02:41:32.296 --> 02:41:33.662
LIAM: First one is a 34.

02:41:33.662 --> 02:41:34.611
MATT: That hits.

02:41:34.611 --> 02:41:40.027
LIAM: Second one is a 27. Third is a 29, so they
all hit.

02:41:40.027 --> 02:41:41.741
MATT: Shit, jeez, 34.

02:41:41.741 --> 02:41:43.169
LIAM: But there's no sneak attack on these--

02:41:43.169 --> 02:41:45.595
MATT: How did you get 34 on your attack?

02:41:45.595 --> 02:41:55.898
LIAM: I don't know anymore. I rolled really high,
and I rolled my attack bonus, like a 19 plus 11?

02:41:55.898 --> 02:41:57.367
A 30?

02:41:57.367 --> 02:41:58.651
MATT: 30, okay.

02:41:58.651 --> 02:41:59.752
LIAM: I don't know.

02:41:59.752 --> 02:42:00.908
MATT: That's okay. A 30 works.

02:42:00.908 --> 02:42:02.421
LIAM: Math looked right when I did it.

02:42:02.421 --> 02:42:08.065
MATT: 34, I was just like (groaning) bleeding from
the nose, I couldn't deal with it. 30 hits.

02:42:08.065 --> 02:42:12.377
LIAM: There's no subterfuge, it might be
stupidity. First one's a ten, second one was a

02:42:12.377 --> 02:42:15.403
ten, and the third one is a seven.

02:42:15.403 --> 02:42:18.472
MATT: Seven. Got it. Cool. That ends your turn,
Vax. That brings us to Vex.

02:42:18.472 --> 02:42:19.824
LAURA: Hunter's Mark!

02:42:19.824 --> 02:42:21.584
MATT: All right. It is...

02:42:21.584 --> 02:42:25.269
LAURA: It wasn't, because I used Lightning Arrow,
so it dropped the concentration on it.

02:42:25.269 --> 02:42:28.530
MATT: That's right, so you Hunter's Mark once
again. Put that back on there. All right.

02:42:28.530 --> 02:42:32.350
LAURA: Although it doesn't really matter because
I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow on him and I

02:42:32.350 --> 02:42:35.149
lose my Hunter's Mark again.

02:42:35.149 --> 02:42:40.179
TRAVIS: Trauma from the earlier episodes. Hunter's
Mark!

02:42:40.179 --> 02:42:43.169
MATT: All right, so Lightning Arrow again, go
ahead and roll for the attack.

02:42:43.169 --> 02:42:48.755
LAURA: Oh yeah! Oh, that's 31?

02:42:48.755 --> 02:42:49.906
LIAM: 79!

02:42:49.906 --> 02:42:51.673
LAURA: 31!

02:42:51.673 --> 02:42:52.945
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

02:42:52.945 --> 02:42:54.236
LAURA: Okay!

02:42:54.236 --> 02:42:57.882
MATT: Gern, you're on deck.

02:42:57.882 --> 02:43:05.356
LAURA: 23!

02:43:05.356 --> 02:43:08.267
MATT: 23 points of damage, all righty.

02:43:08.267 --> 02:43:10.152
LAURA: That's better.

02:43:10.152 --> 02:43:14.499
MATT: (impact) The lightning slams into his chest,
and you can see it arcs through its scimitar that

02:43:14.499 --> 02:43:18.320
it's holding up in its hand, and it shakes and
almost drops the weapon, and catches its arm as

02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:22.691
the electricity disperses out the edge of the
blade and looks back at you. He's now glaring at

02:43:22.691 --> 02:43:24.107
both you and Scanlan.

02:43:24.107 --> 02:43:27.969
LAURA: I'm going to use my movement to run up
around the molten lava and hold my hand out for

02:43:27.969 --> 02:43:32.370
Gern, so that he can use me to get out of the
molten lava.

02:43:32.370 --> 02:43:34.174
MATT: All right, that's as far as you can get
there.

02:43:34.174 --> 02:43:35.151
LAURA: Okay.

02:43:35.151 --> 02:43:39.635
MATT: Gern, top of your turn, you take 24 points
of fire damage from the lava as you're sinking

02:43:39.635 --> 02:43:41.974
into it. (sizzling)

02:43:41.974 --> 02:43:48.665
CHRIS: So, can I jump up and then cast a spell?

02:43:48.665 --> 02:43:55.482
MATT: Right now you can try and cast, in this
area, but you would have a hard time

02:43:55.482 --> 02:43:58.452
concentrating. I'd say you'd have to take a
concentration check to even get a spell out,

02:43:58.452 --> 02:44:01.434
because you're in so much pain. I'd say you would
probably want to move out of the lava before you

02:44:01.434 --> 02:44:02.465
do that.

02:44:02.465 --> 02:44:03.959
CHRIS: All right, I'll get out of the lava.

02:44:03.959 --> 02:44:07.125
MATT: So you (straining) stand up.

02:44:07.125 --> 02:44:08.497
LAURA: Take my hand!

02:44:08.497 --> 02:44:13.141
MATT: It's too deep and you're having to basically
wade your way through, which is burning your hands

02:44:13.141 --> 02:44:14.564
as you get over there.

02:44:14.564 --> 02:44:15.897
CHRIS: What about my broom?

02:44:15.897 --> 02:44:20.768
MATT: You were holding your broom! So here's what
you do. You go ahead and you lift yourself up out

02:44:20.768 --> 02:44:26.638
of the lava onto the broom and then (blowing)
push. You're not fully on it, and it's hard to

02:44:26.638 --> 02:44:30.830
engage its mental commands directly with the
current amount of chaos around you, but you do

02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:36.278
manage to skirt yourself to the very edge of the
lava and land on your feet, which are numb after

02:44:36.278 --> 02:44:39.668
the sheer amount of pain you've suffered, and
you don't even want to look down at what you look

02:44:39.668 --> 02:44:40.930
like from the waist below.

02:44:40.930 --> 02:44:42.934
LAURA: Do you need me to hold your broom while you
cast your spell?

02:44:42.934 --> 02:44:44.232
CHRIS: Please!

02:44:44.232 --> 02:44:45.185
LAURA: Thank you!

02:44:45.185 --> 02:44:46.452
SAM: Oh, don't do-- Okay.

02:44:46.452 --> 02:44:48.824
MATT: So she takes the broom from your hand. What
are you going to cast?

02:44:48.824 --> 02:44:50.071
CHRIS: Disintegrate.

02:44:50.071 --> 02:44:51.339
MATT: Okay!

02:44:51.339 --> 02:44:53.064
TRAVIS: Disintegrate?

02:44:53.064 --> 02:44:54.511
SAM: That's a spell?

02:44:54.511 --> 02:44:56.714
LIAM: That's a big one, we've seen that happen.

02:44:56.714 --> 02:44:57.781
SAM: We have?

02:44:57.781 --> 02:44:58.704
MARISHA: Yes.

02:44:58.704 --> 02:44:59.762
SAM: Who did that?

02:44:59.762 --> 02:45:01.336
LIAM: The giants got disintegrated.

02:45:01.336 --> 02:45:03.115
CHRIS: I'm fairly pissed at the moment.

02:45:03.115 --> 02:45:06.877
MATT: As you should be. All right, so you get to
go ahead and roll.

02:45:06.877 --> 02:45:08.733
LIAM: Get the fucker, you dirty bastard.

02:45:08.733 --> 02:45:15.241
MATT: Let me get to the spell here real fast.
Disintegrate. Oh, it just makes a dexterity saving

02:45:15.309 --> 02:45:18.082
throw! It doesn't even get a chance. All right,
what's your spell DC again?

02:45:18.082 --> 02:45:19.297
CHRIS: 16.

02:45:19.297 --> 02:45:21.376
MATT: 16. It rolled a two.

02:45:21.376 --> 02:45:22.815
LAURA: Yes!

02:45:22.815 --> 02:45:29.939
MATT: That's going to be bad. All right, roll 10d6
plus 40 damage. Damn!

02:45:29.939 --> 02:45:31.742
TRAVIS: 10d6?

02:45:31.742 --> 02:45:47.363
MATT: Disintegrate doesn't mess around. It's an
all or nothing spell. If they make the save,

02:45:47.363 --> 02:45:50.327
nothing. You don't make it, (explosion).

02:45:50.327 --> 02:45:53.517
CHRIS: 27, 33, 36... So 76!

02:45:53.517 --> 02:46:00.751
MATT: 76 points of force damage. As you get out,
you can see your vest itself is burning, there's

02:46:00.751 --> 02:46:07.030
still elements of embers burning at the edges of
the leather and the cloth. The bottom part of your

02:46:07.030 --> 02:46:12.198
scales are a combination of blue, black, and
little bits have cracked open where you can see

02:46:12.198 --> 02:46:14.962
red flesh underneath. There's a lot of burn
damage.

02:46:14.962 --> 02:46:17.212
CHRIS: The zippers are very hot, I might add.

02:46:17.212 --> 02:46:22.670
MATT: They're really glowing. However, as you turn
around, as your fin jewelry on the sides of your

02:46:22.670 --> 02:46:27.055
face jangles with the speed as you spin around and
point your finger upward, the arcane energy

02:46:27.055 --> 02:46:33.011
forming at the end of your finger, this singular
beam of dull green arcane energy streaks forward.

02:46:33.011 --> 02:46:39.348
The efreet, who is currently focused on Scanlan
and watching Vex run past, looks down just in time

02:46:39.348 --> 02:46:43.588
to see you release the spell. Opens his eyes and
attempts to dodge out of the way, unfortunately

02:46:43.588 --> 02:46:48.577
not fast enough. It blasts in the side of its
shoulder and you can see as a whole chunk of its

02:46:48.577 --> 02:46:55.835
back muscle, shoulder, and lower torso are just
turned to dust, exposing bone and elements of its

02:46:55.835 --> 02:47:02.522
musculature and flesh underneath. It goes (snarls)
and looks down. It can't even make a loud emission

02:47:02.522 --> 02:47:09.162
of pain, it's just gutturally whispering its
horrible suffering. As it looks down, it reaches

02:47:09.162 --> 02:47:14.906
up with its hand and cauterizes the wound on the
back of its body, leaving it a charred cinder. It

02:47:14.906 --> 02:47:20.639
glares down at you, extremely angry. "I hate you
most of all, scarecrow!"

02:47:20.639 --> 02:47:23.574
CHRIS: Go back to your fire slit!

02:47:23.574 --> 02:47:31.167
MATT: Percy, you're up. Unless you want your dudes
to do anything, by the way. They're still over

02:47:31.167 --> 02:47:32.741
there dancing.

02:47:32.741 --> 02:47:38.316
CHRIS: They should get a little bit closer and
dance in front of him, just to make sure. They get

02:47:38.316 --> 02:47:40.564
very self-conscious if no one's paying attention.

02:47:40.564 --> 02:47:41.999
SAM: Of course.

02:47:41.999 --> 02:47:43.367
MATT: They're just cheering on.

02:47:43.367 --> 02:47:45.134
TRAVIS: At least they're dancing while I'm standing 
on fire.

02:47:45.134 --> 02:47:52.218
TALIESIN: Can I knock him down a notch? Can I try
and shoot him to drop him out of the sky a bit?

02:47:52.218 --> 02:47:53.800
MATT: You can certainly try.

02:47:53.800 --> 02:47:58.770
TALIESIN: I'm going to try. First of all, I'm
going to Hex him. He's hexed. I point.

02:47:58.770 --> 02:48:00.095
MATT: All right, so the Hex moves over.

02:48:00.095 --> 02:48:07.673
TALIESIN: Hex moves over. And I'm going to take a
shot to try and drop him. I'm going to take a grit

02:48:07.673 --> 02:48:09.169
shot to drop him.

02:48:09.169 --> 02:48:10.581
MATT: Go for it.

02:48:10.581 --> 02:48:13.960
TALIESIN: That's 22.

02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:15.455
MATT: 22 hits.

02:48:15.455 --> 02:48:19.802
TALIESIN: And that's, what's the saving throw for
that? Strength throw.

02:48:19.802 --> 02:48:21.876
MATT: Strength? 23.

02:48:21.876 --> 02:48:23.460
TALIESIN: Aw, really?

02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:24.968
MATT: Yeah. Sorry.

02:48:24.968 --> 02:48:26.730
TALIESIN: That's fine, he'll just take his damage.

02:48:26.730 --> 02:48:29.573
MATT: Little bitch. Plus 1d6, don't forget.

02:48:29.573 --> 02:48:31.335
TALIESIN: Yes, thank you.

02:48:31.335 --> 02:48:33.905
MATT: Wow, Disintegrate spell fucked him up.

02:48:33.905 --> 02:48:37.197
TALIESIN: That's 17 points of damage.

02:48:37.197 --> 02:48:38.468
MATT: Nice.

02:48:38.468 --> 02:48:41.674
TALIESIN: I'm going to shoot again.

02:48:41.674 --> 02:48:43.707
MATT: Is this with your pistol?

02:48:43.707 --> 02:48:45.371
TALIESIN: Yeah, just with the pistol right now.

02:48:45.371 --> 02:48:47.199
MATT: And what's your first range increment on
that?

02:48:47.199 --> 02:48:48.665
TALIESIN: 400.

02:48:48.665 --> 02:48:49.843
MATT: The pistol?

02:48:49.843 --> 02:48:51.961
TALIESIN: Yeah. 1,200 for Bad News.

02:48:51.961 --> 02:48:53.863
MATT: Your first range increment.

02:48:53.863 --> 02:48:55.963
TALIESIN: I'm sharpshooter, I have no range
increment.

02:48:55.963 --> 02:48:59.250
MATT: That's right. Good call. All right, so fire
again.

02:48:59.250 --> 02:49:03.565
TALIESIN: Range increments are for-- We don't do
that here.

02:49:03.565 --> 02:49:04.696
MATT: Yeah.

02:49:04.696 --> 02:49:10.858
TALIESIN: That's a 31 to hit.

02:49:10.858 --> 02:49:13.185
MATT: That hits, roll damage. Scanlan, you're up
next, by the way.

02:49:13.185 --> 02:49:17.391
TALIESIN: And that's 16 points of damage.

02:49:17.391 --> 02:49:22.780
MATT: All righty. (two impacts) Just as it manages
to cauterize the wounds from the Disintegrate

02:49:22.780 --> 02:49:27.576
spell, both bullets blast into its torso, and you
can see it's now, thinking the height advantage

02:49:27.576 --> 02:49:32.637
would be helpful, after being locked in a hamster
ball and now being repeatedly blasted from every

02:49:32.637 --> 02:49:36.360
which way, it's not enjoying its current
experience by any means.

02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:39.966
TALIESIN: It's going to get worse. All right, and
now I'm doing a sharpshooter shot.

02:49:39.966 --> 02:49:41.853
MARISHA: Pew pew.

02:49:41.853 --> 02:49:45.466
TALIESIN: Pew pew. That's 18?

02:49:45.466 --> 02:49:47.018
MATT: 18 hits.

02:49:47.018 --> 02:49:56.186
TALIESIN: And that's 12, 18, 28 points of damage.

02:49:56.186 --> 02:50:02.037
MATT: Nice! This one (impact) blasts into the
center of its chest, and you can see part of its

02:50:02.037 --> 02:50:08.538
pectoral muscle tears open and flame erupts from
the impact. It reaches up and (snarling).

02:50:08.538 --> 02:50:18.044
TALIESIN: Action surge. Fuck this guy. Same thing,
sharpshooter. I'm going to be rolling

02:50:18.044 --> 02:50:19.210
sharpshooter.

02:50:19.210 --> 02:50:20.355
MATT: Go for it, okay.

02:50:20.355 --> 02:50:21.425
LIAM: Get the other nipple, now?

02:50:21.425 --> 02:50:22.918
TALIESIN: The other nipple.

02:50:22.918 --> 02:50:24.708
MARISHA: Matching piercings.

02:50:24.708 --> 02:50:26.284
TALIESIN: 22.

02:50:26.284 --> 02:50:30.848
MATT: 22 hits. This is going to be a rough round
for him.

02:50:30.848 --> 02:50:36.270
TALIESIN: 27 points of damage.

02:50:36.270 --> 02:50:38.893
MATT: Ooh!

02:50:38.893 --> 02:50:40.695
TALIESIN: Reload and one more shot!

02:50:40.695 --> 02:50:42.364
LAURA: Jesus Christ! I mean.

02:50:42.364 --> 02:50:43.902
TALIESIN: Reload, one more shot.

02:50:43.902 --> 02:50:45.208
MATT: You got it.

02:50:45.208 --> 02:50:47.790
TALIESIN: That's 17, 27, 29--

02:50:47.790 --> 02:50:50.371
MATT: That's a hit. Go for it, roll damage.

02:50:50.371 --> 02:50:51.515
TALIESIN: That hits.

02:50:51.515 --> 02:50:52.660
MATT: Damn, man.

02:50:52.660 --> 02:50:55.825
TALIESIN: 21 points of damage.

02:50:55.825 --> 02:51:01.822
MATT: All right. (two impacts) These holes are
beginning to appear in its body where the bits of

02:51:01.822 --> 02:51:08.455
fiery flesh are being blasted away from the
impacts of your weapon. All right, that brings us

02:51:08.455 --> 02:51:09.888
to Scanlan!

02:51:09.888 --> 02:51:11.156
LAURA: It didn't kill him?

02:51:11.156 --> 02:51:14.723
TALIESIN: No, but he's a sieve now.

02:51:14.723 --> 02:51:16.726
MATT: You guys held him--

02:51:16.726 --> 02:51:20.270
LIAM: He just took 100 points of damage.

02:51:20.270 --> 02:51:21.628
TALIESIN: He took a lot of damage.

02:51:21.628 --> 02:51:28.733
SAM: Hey, that Ioun stone that I have? Does that
allow me to cast a fourth level three spell?

02:51:28.733 --> 02:51:33.121
MATT: If the spell you put into it was a fourth
3rd-level spell, yeah.

02:51:33.121 --> 02:51:35.962
SAM: It was a 3rd-level spell, so it's an extra
3rd-level spell?

02:51:35.962 --> 02:51:37.047
MATT: Right.

02:51:37.047 --> 02:51:40.791
SAM: I'm maxed out on 3rd-level spells, but I
still have that thing.

02:51:40.791 --> 02:51:43.824
MATT: Yeah, so it wouldn't be a 4th-level spell
because you didn't cast into it as a 4th-level.

02:51:43.824 --> 02:51:47.775
SAM: No, I mean, the fourth time I've cast a
3rd-level spell.

02:51:47.775 --> 02:51:50.777
MATT: Oh, got you. It wouldn't count against your
daily. It's in addition to that.

02:51:50.777 --> 02:51:57.250
SAM: Okay! So I will, for the first time ever, use
that stupid Ioun stone and cast Lightning Bolt

02:51:57.250 --> 02:52:00.359
again. I'm just sticking with my method here.

02:52:00.359 --> 02:52:04.595
MATT: All right, all right. With a five, it does
not make its saving throw. Go ahead and roll

02:52:04.595 --> 02:52:06.074
damage. 8d6.

02:52:06.074 --> 02:52:08.426
SAM: 8d6, thank you.

02:52:08.426 --> 02:52:12.956
LIAM: Here comes the cube.

02:52:12.956 --> 02:52:21.397
CHRIS: 23, 28.

02:52:21.397 --> 02:52:25.242
SAM: Thank you. Did you do this one too? 28!

02:52:25.242 --> 02:52:26.991
MATT: How do you want to do this?

02:52:26.991 --> 02:52:28.912
(cheering)

02:52:28.912 --> 02:52:31.493
TRAVIS: Both kills! Both of them!

02:52:31.493 --> 02:52:43.270
SAM: I think I would like to, if there's a way,
I'd like to angle it somehow so that he will drop

02:52:43.270 --> 02:52:50.058
right on top of Grog. I feel like Grog can do
something to a falling behemoth.

02:52:50.058 --> 02:52:53.684
MATT: It's hard-pressed from this angle,
unfortunately. Grog is at an angle where you

02:52:53.684 --> 02:52:55.183
wouldn't really be able to do that.

02:52:55.183 --> 02:52:56.198
SAM: Damn it.

02:52:56.198 --> 02:52:59.611
MATT: Mind you, when you blast him, he'll plummet
close to his feet, if you wanted to.

02:52:59.611 --> 02:53:07.966
SAM: All right, yes, let's do that so Grog can
feel like he gets part of this, too. And if I can,

02:53:07.966 --> 02:53:11.356
I'd like to burn a big S in his chest.

02:53:11.356 --> 02:53:17.630
MATT: So, as you charge up and blast the lightning
bolt from your crotch region, you then do a little

02:53:17.630 --> 02:53:23.194
dance maneuver with your waist, causing it to
(crackling) carve a Scanlan S into the torso of

02:53:23.194 --> 02:53:29.200
the efreet. As it plummets to the ground, slamming
into where the lava would be, while the fire

02:53:29.200 --> 02:53:32.874
doesn't hurt its form, you can see, Grog, as it
stands in the ground (groaning). Its form is

02:53:32.874 --> 02:53:37.487
turning into ash around you. It's actually just
dissipating and turning to ash as its eyes roll up

02:53:37.487 --> 02:53:39.019
and meet with yours.

02:53:39.019 --> 02:53:44.489
TRAVIS: I run over in the lava and I go, I'd like
to cast Beheading!

02:53:44.489 --> 02:53:53.445
MATT: All right. You suffer 26 points of fire
damage, reduced to 13 from taking another

02:53:53.445 --> 02:53:54.442
round in there.

02:53:54.442 --> 02:53:57.341
TRAVIS: Not a problem. Totally worth it for the
spell.

02:53:57.341 --> 02:54:00.420
MATT: As you take Craven Edge and take the head
off. As the head rolls away--

02:54:00.420 --> 02:54:01.523
TRAVIS: I grab it!

02:54:01.523 --> 02:54:03.024
MATT: You grab it! It turns to ash.

02:54:03.024 --> 02:54:04.855
TRAVIS: (panting) I run out of the lake.

02:54:04.855 --> 02:54:09.107
MATT: You get out of the lava, stand on the side,
and look over just as the rest of the head turns

02:54:09.107 --> 02:54:10.694
to ashes.

02:54:10.694 --> 02:54:12.056
TRAVIS: Aw, shit.

02:54:12.056 --> 02:54:13.125
LAURA: I walk up to Grog.

02:54:13.125 --> 02:54:14.057
LIAM: You did it again!

02:54:14.057 --> 02:54:19.856
LAURA: I pat him on the shoulder, and say, that
was so impressive. A genuine mage! And I use

02:54:19.856 --> 02:54:26.111
sleight of hand to shove the flying broom into the
Bag of Holding.

02:54:26.111 --> 02:54:27.888
MATT: Okay. Roll sleight of hand.

02:54:27.888 --> 02:54:28.805
TALIESIN: Whoa!

02:54:28.805 --> 02:54:30.063
LIAM: Yeah, girl.

02:54:30.063 --> 02:54:31.422
CHRIS: Am I allowed to roll a perception?

02:54:31.422 --> 02:54:32.403
MATT: Yes, you can.

02:54:32.403 --> 02:54:35.861
LIAM: Come on, Vex. Come on, sister.

02:54:35.861 --> 02:54:37.302
LAURA: 18?

02:54:37.302 --> 02:54:38.425
LIAM: Get it.

02:54:38.425 --> 02:54:41.485
CHRIS: 16.

02:54:41.485 --> 02:54:42.568
MATT: Plus?

02:54:42.568 --> 02:54:43.502
TALIESIN: No.

02:54:43.502 --> 02:54:44.575
MATT: Total of 16?

02:54:44.575 --> 02:54:45.697
CHRIS: 15 plus one, yeah.

02:54:45.697 --> 02:54:51.366
MATT: As you're dealing with this, you have no
notice of this. You may question it later, if you

02:54:51.366 --> 02:54:54.776
like, but you have no idea where it went, and
didn't see any of this transaction happen.

02:54:54.776 --> 02:54:58.195
LAURA: Oh no! Oh no!

02:54:58.195 --> 02:54:59.509
SAM: What, what is it?

02:54:59.509 --> 02:55:01.338
LAURA: Your broom fell in the lava!

02:55:01.338 --> 02:55:02.598
CHRIS: What?

02:55:02.598 --> 02:55:03.709
LAURA: I saw it!

02:55:03.709 --> 02:55:05.044
CHRIS: I just turned around for a moment!

02:55:05.044 --> 02:55:06.779
LAURA: I tried to give it back to you and it fell
in the lava!

02:55:06.779 --> 02:55:07.761
CHRIS: Are you sure?

02:55:07.761 --> 02:55:08.556
LAURA: Yeah!

02:55:08.556 --> 02:55:09.830
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:55:09.830 --> 02:55:11.363
SAM: You shouldn't have looked at me when I cast
my spell!

02:55:11.363 --> 02:55:12.823
CHRIS: This is why I never looked at you before!

02:55:12.823 --> 02:55:14.147
SAM: I was wrong to doubt you!

02:55:14.147 --> 02:55:18.355
CHRIS: No! No, you're a constant source of
disappointment!

02:55:18.355 --> 02:55:19.546
LAURA: 18.

02:55:19.546 --> 02:55:21.356
CHRIS: Where's my fucking broom?

02:55:21.356 --> 02:55:22.835
MATT: Make an insight check now.

02:55:22.835 --> 02:55:28.363
CHRIS: Insight. 13.

02:55:28.363 --> 02:55:33.837
MATT: 13. She's telling the truth, man. That broom
just went straight in the lava.

02:55:33.837 --> 02:55:35.463
SAM: You're a horrible person.

02:55:35.463 --> 02:55:38.803
CHRIS: You know, I'm really good at reading
people, and I know that you're telling me the

02:55:38.803 --> 02:55:39.985
truth right now.

02:55:39.985 --> 02:55:41.401
LAURA: I'm so sorry.

02:55:41.401 --> 02:55:48.732
CHRIS: No, I feel your sorrow. I feel it. I feel
bad for you, that you have to experience that!

02:55:48.732 --> 02:55:54.310
It's just a broom. Right? It's just a flying broom
that's very difficult to find, no big deal.

02:55:54.310 --> 02:55:56.700
LAURA: I wouldn't know. I don't even know.

02:55:56.700 --> 02:56:02.340
CHRIS: That's all right. You know, it actually--
It sterilized me, actually, I'm quite glad. It has

02:56:02.340 --> 02:56:09.171
very dirty properties. Anyone that would put it
between their legs to fly around would be in

02:56:09.171 --> 02:56:13.243
horrible danger. Horrible danger. So it's actually
probably for the better.

02:56:13.243 --> 02:56:14.520
SAM: Communicable diseases?

02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:21.931
CHRIS: Yeah, so many STDs. It's really just like a
disease tampon, is really what it is.

02:56:21.931 --> 02:56:25.437
LIAM: A what? Is that like a magic candle?

02:56:25.437 --> 02:56:27.850
CHRIS: It's sort of like a magic candle.

02:56:27.850 --> 02:56:29.483
LAURA: A tragedy candle.

02:56:29.483 --> 02:56:30.844
CHRIS: It's a tragedy candle.

02:56:30.844 --> 02:56:32.078
TALIESIN: A Blanston candle.

02:56:32.078 --> 02:56:33.002
CHRIS: Yes.

02:56:33.002 --> 02:56:34.773
LIAM: I don't understand sorcery at all.

02:56:34.773 --> 02:56:40.112
MATT: At this point, you hear the flickering of
flame and the portal itself has begun to expand

02:56:40.112 --> 02:56:42.091
even further, glowing brighter.

02:56:42.091 --> 02:56:48.143
MARISHA: Keyleth throws up a Skywrite spell and
says, we're taking the portal.

02:56:48.143 --> 02:56:58.648
MATT: Okay. As this is happening, the flames
themselves grow higher and higher. The lava begins

02:56:58.648 --> 02:57:03.703
to boil and roil. As you guys all move up to the
side, you can see the lava is beginning to

02:57:03.703 --> 02:57:08.659
(bubbling) splash out and spray bits are starting
to scatter as some of the nearby trees tumble

02:57:08.659 --> 02:57:14.364
over. You can see the four Fire Ashari as well as
Korren come across one of the clearings. The other

02:57:14.364 --> 02:57:20.011
way, you see what looks to be another salamander
gets thrown about 15 feet from the trees, hits the

02:57:20.011 --> 02:57:26.660
ground, skids, and is motionless as you see
Cerkonos with the rest of the Pyrah, the Fire

02:57:26.660 --> 02:57:33.270
Ashari stepping through. "Keyleth. We saw your
symbol. Is it time?"

02:57:33.270 --> 02:57:34.530
MARISHA: Yes.

02:57:34.530 --> 02:57:39.668
MATT: "All right. Let us try to close this rift."
And the rest of the druids all begin to gather

02:57:39.668 --> 02:57:45.471
around the outside of this portal. As it's
flickering, you can see, piercing into the

02:57:45.471 --> 02:57:50.156
extremely blinding light, Keyleth, you take a
moment, and using your attachment to the Fire

02:57:50.156 --> 02:57:55.666
Ashari and the Fire Elemental Plane from your last
passage through it, you can see past the

02:57:55.666 --> 02:58:01.191
brightness and see beyond the doorway. You can see
on the other side, there appears to be probably

02:58:01.191 --> 02:58:05.403
another half dozen or a dozen or so of a few other
elementals and salamanders that are now making

02:58:05.403 --> 02:58:07.045
their way towards the portal.

02:58:07.045 --> 02:58:13.330
MARISHA: I stand next to my father and join the
rest of the druids.

02:58:13.330 --> 02:58:15.924
LAURA: Grog, you should probably help them with
all of your magic powers.

02:58:15.924 --> 02:58:17.814
TRAVIS: Do you think so? It feels like it's an
intimate thing.

02:58:17.814 --> 02:58:19.364
LAURA: Just hold your hands up, hold your hands
up.

02:58:19.364 --> 02:58:20.590
TRAVIS: All right.

02:58:20.590 --> 02:58:26.694
MATT: All right. As the rest of the Ashari begin
to gather around the portal and concentrate, they

02:58:26.694 --> 02:58:33.112
are managing to hold the rift in its current size.
You see as beads of sweat begin to pour down

02:58:33.112 --> 02:58:39.117
Korren's face, not used to this type of terrain.
He goes (gasps), "We need more power!"

02:58:39.117 --> 02:58:40.579
TRAVIS: Okay!

02:58:40.579 --> 02:58:45.243
MATT: "If you can aid, whatever you have to bring
to this, please, now is the time!" Does anyone

02:58:45.243 --> 02:58:46.666
wish to help with the ritual?

02:58:46.666 --> 02:58:47.684
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

02:58:47.684 --> 02:58:48.789
CHRIS: I'll help.

02:58:48.789 --> 02:58:50.549
MATT: All right, how would you wish to help?

02:58:50.549 --> 02:58:54.905
SAM: What a nice guy he is! Certainly not someone
we should swindle!

02:58:54.905 --> 02:58:58.228
LIAM: Strange that you would say that.

02:58:58.228 --> 02:59:00.333
CHRIS: I would know if someone were trying to
swindle me, believe me.

02:59:00.333 --> 02:59:01.611
SAM: That's true. That is true!

02:59:01.611 --> 02:59:05.705
CHRIS: You all have honest faces. Particularly
her, over there. Very honest face. What can I do

02:59:05.705 --> 02:59:07.157
to help?

02:59:07.157 --> 02:59:12.977
MATT: What do you think would lend itself to a
fire gate-sealing ritual? It could be a spell, it

02:59:12.977 --> 02:59:15.437
could be a use of a skill. How would you like to--?

02:59:15.437 --> 02:59:17.497
SAM: A candle? Do you have any candles that could
aid?

02:59:17.497 --> 02:59:19.204
LAURA: Like fiery candles, maybe?

02:59:19.204 --> 02:59:28.275
CHRIS: I have a-- No, this one casts-- This is
bright light, there's a thunder candle. Blink

02:59:28.275 --> 02:59:33.045
candle. Destroy-- No, that destroys dexterity. I
have a thunder candle, but I don't know if that

02:59:33.045 --> 02:59:34.349
would work.

02:59:34.349 --> 02:59:41.006
MATT: Make an arcana check.

02:59:41.006 --> 02:59:44.330
CHRIS: 19.

02:59:44.330 --> 02:59:50.129
MATT: 19. The Blink candle, which you crafted from
various parts from blink dogs and other creatures

02:59:50.129 --> 02:59:55.141
that have natural translocation capabilities,
might have the capability, as this is a doorway

02:59:55.141 --> 03:00:00.577
between planes, and teleportation magic is based
on creating short-form doorways between similar

03:00:00.577 --> 03:00:04.429
spaces, might have some impact on the ritual if
used properly.

03:00:04.429 --> 03:00:10.548
CHRIS: I have this Blink candle. It's formed from
various animals that blink and if-- that has

03:00:10.548 --> 03:00:17.354
trans-dimensional properties, very good
properties. The best kind of robust properties

03:00:17.354 --> 03:00:24.467
that I can throw it in, and it might help stop
the-- from-- all of that.

03:00:24.467 --> 03:00:26.436
TRAVIS: That makes perfect sense.

03:00:26.436 --> 03:00:29.239
CHRIS: Right. So we're all in agreement, then.

03:00:29.239 --> 03:00:30.932
SAM: Well-explained!

03:00:30.932 --> 03:00:38.667
CHRIS: All right. So I'm going to hand Blink
candle to Coral and I'm going to have Coral walk

03:00:38.667 --> 03:00:40.877
into the portal.

03:00:40.877 --> 03:00:42.230
TRAVIS: Brave Coral.

03:00:42.230 --> 03:00:46.782
CHRIS: Brave Coral. Fuck, I've lost two and my
broom. What a fucking terrible day.

03:00:46.782 --> 03:00:58.673
MATT: As Coral takes the candle, (groans) turns
around and begins to just slowly melt, steps into

03:00:58.673 --> 03:00:59.904
the lava.

03:00:59.904 --> 03:01:01.670
LIAM: Run, Coral, run!

03:01:01.670 --> 03:01:07.434
MATT: Nine points of fire damage to Coral who was
already sitting at--

03:01:07.434 --> 03:01:10.576
CHRIS: Six.

03:01:10.576 --> 03:01:16.891
MATT: And had taken six damage, right? So 15
from 33. Coral's at half health. Coral, as this is

03:01:16.891 --> 03:01:22.447
rough terrain, gets part of the way there,
then continues walking forward the rest of the

03:01:22.447 --> 03:01:29.360
way. Takes an additional 17 points of damage.

03:01:29.360 --> 03:01:30.751
LAURA: Oh no.

03:01:30.751 --> 03:01:40.806
MATT: So that's 32 points of damage. What's
Coral's hitpoints? 33 is the max?

03:01:40.806 --> 03:01:42.939
LAURA: That's what you said.

03:01:42.939 --> 03:01:50.682
MATT: Yep. On the sheet right there. I can read my own
text. 33 hit points. Coral, at one hitpoint, gets

03:01:50.682 --> 03:01:57.755
up to the lava, take the candle and (boof). As
the energy expands from it, you can see a ripple,

03:01:57.755 --> 03:02:05.756
a heat wave ripple, that billows outward. Coral
vanishes entirely and the portal shrinks down by

03:02:05.756 --> 03:02:09.701
about five to six feet, actually closing in its
space

03:02:09.701 --> 03:02:12.024
CHRIS: Oh, Coral, I forgot to tell you somethi--
fuck.

03:02:12.024 --> 03:02:19.182
MATT: Suddenly you hear a (zip) and Coral appears
about ten, 15 feet in the air--

03:02:19.182 --> 03:02:23.118
CHRIS: Oh good, there you are. Listen, did you see
my broom?

03:02:23.118 --> 03:02:35.610
MATT: Smack! Coral falls those 15 feet, taking six
points of bludgeoning damage. Let's see if Coral

03:02:35.610 --> 03:02:46.406
survives this with Undead Fortitude. Nope. That is
a roll of eight versus a total DC of 11 with the

03:02:46.406 --> 03:02:53.743
damage taken, and Coral just splats like a really,
really old orange just slammed into the concrete,

03:02:53.743 --> 03:02:55.382
just (splatting).

03:02:55.382 --> 03:02:59.166
TRAVIS: Like an old orange.

03:02:59.166 --> 03:03:05.056
MATT: One of the Fire Ashari goes (cringing,
gagging) and just ends up concentrating on holding

03:03:05.056 --> 03:03:06.429
the gate.

03:03:06.429 --> 03:03:09.264
CHRIS: I'm starting to think you're all very bad
luck.

03:03:09.264 --> 03:03:12.644
MATT: However, that did aid the ritual. We have
two more folks who could aid in this ritual.

03:03:12.644 --> 03:03:18.914
LAURA: I can use-- I don't know if it will help,
but I have a really great diamond of awesomeness

03:03:18.914 --> 03:03:20.987
that's precious.

03:03:20.987 --> 03:03:22.833
MATT: How would that help the ritual?

03:03:22.833 --> 03:03:23.953
LAURA: I don't know.

03:03:23.953 --> 03:03:27.490
MARISHA: Am I a part of the people who could be
included in the ritual too?

03:03:27.490 --> 03:03:28.766
MATT: Yeah. Oh yeah.

03:03:28.766 --> 03:03:36.813
MARISHA: Okay. I am going to cast a 7th-level
Plane Shift to help smush it closed.

03:03:36.813 --> 03:03:41.855
MATT: All right, go ahead and make a nature roll
with advantage. This is your understanding of

03:03:41.855 --> 03:03:46.750
the natural elements of the world around you and
the connection you have with the fire elemental plane.

03:03:46.750 --> 03:03:49.279
LAURA: I don't know how this magic stuff works.

03:03:49.279 --> 03:03:53.141
TRAVIS: Oh, I'll teach you later.

03:03:53.141 --> 03:03:57.064
MARISHA: 12. Oh, with advantage. 23

03:03:57.064 --> 03:04:05.007
MATT: 23. As you begin to concentrate, your hands
instinctively burst into flames to coalesce your

03:04:05.007 --> 03:04:10.243
connection to the Fire Elemental Plane. As you
complete the Plane Shift spell, your form shimmers

03:04:10.243 --> 03:04:14.923
for a second, and for a moment it looks like she's
only partially there. She's actually translucent,

03:04:14.923 --> 03:04:19.726
as flames begin to lick up the sides of her body.
At this point, you can see the lava flow in the

03:04:19.726 --> 03:04:25.283
mountain begins to slow and the bubbling begins to
come to a stillness. The portal itself shimmers

03:04:25.283 --> 03:04:31.621
again and then shrinks down to the size of a
normal doorway, about five foot by ten foot tall,

03:04:31.621 --> 03:04:35.775
and it's just barely holding on. As you're
concentrating on holding it in its place, you can

03:04:35.775 --> 03:04:40.813
see now the rest of the druids around are sweating
profusely. Who wishes to take on the last part of

03:04:40.813 --> 03:04:42.042
this ritual?

03:04:42.042 --> 03:04:48.784
TRAVIS: I have a Firebrand Warhammer. I could hit
it. Anybody else got anything better?

03:04:48.784 --> 03:04:50.497
LAURA: Do you have any magic stuff, Scanlan?

03:04:50.497 --> 03:04:54.771
SAM: I can inspire them. I mean...

03:04:54.771 --> 03:04:57.213
TRAVIS: Your Dimension Door?

03:04:57.213 --> 03:04:59.380
MARISHA: Do you have your Dimension Door?

03:04:59.380 --> 03:05:00.960
SAM: Dimension Door what?

03:05:00.960 --> 03:05:04.941
MARISHA: A door. I did Planar Binding, which
technically really wasn't supposed to do what I

03:05:04.941 --> 03:05:06.045
just did--

03:05:06.045 --> 03:05:07.310
MATT: Planar Shift you said.

03:05:07.310 --> 03:05:09.284
MARISHA: Planar Shift, I mean, yes. 7th-level.

03:05:09.284 --> 03:05:12.916
MATT: Finding ways to tailor magic essences into
this type of a ritual.

03:05:12.916 --> 03:05:19.064
SAM: Do I know that that will work or help?

03:05:19.064 --> 03:05:25.101
MATT: You don't know. You'll find out. However you
wish to aid this ritual and justify how it would

03:05:25.101 --> 03:05:26.861
be helpful in this instance.

03:05:26.861 --> 03:05:30.592
LIAM: There's something I could do.

03:05:30.592 --> 03:05:34.591
TRAVIS: Yeah, spit it up.

03:05:34.591 --> 03:05:42.139
LIAM: I whip the Cape of the Mountebank out of my
pocket and run at that door and jump off the edge

03:05:42.139 --> 03:05:46.521
and just try to balloon umbrella it down over with
that red cape.

03:05:46.521 --> 03:05:51.435
MATT: Hmm. Okay.

03:05:51.435 --> 03:05:53.255
LAURA: Matador it.

03:05:53.255 --> 03:05:55.449
LIAM: I'm doing it. I'm matadoring it.

03:05:55.449 --> 03:06:03.471
MATT: Okay. I will say-- hmm. How do I make this
work? I'm going to want you to go ahead and make

03:06:03.471 --> 03:06:05.866
an acrobatics check.

03:06:05.866 --> 03:06:09.307
LIAM: Okay. That is a 25.

03:06:09.307 --> 03:06:14.681
MATT: All right. You rush up, leaping off the
side, spinning in the air. As you, do you unfurl

03:06:14.681 --> 03:06:20.699
the cape and turn it into a limited parachute-type
projection and as you slam it down towards-- I

03:06:20.699 --> 03:06:31.269
need you to go ahead and make a wisdom check to
see if you have the capability of triggering the

03:06:31.269 --> 03:06:34.190
magic of the item at the right time to be
impactful.

03:06:34.190 --> 03:06:35.464
LIAM: Cross your fingers, everybody.

03:06:35.464 --> 03:06:36.422
TRAVIS: Come on, Vax.

03:06:36.422 --> 03:06:37.907
LIAM: No bonuses here.

03:06:37.907 --> 03:06:39.185
CHRIS: No whammys.

03:06:39.185 --> 03:06:42.862
MARISHA: We don't still have our fancy feast, do
we?

03:06:42.862 --> 03:06:44.606
SAM: Oh, yeah, are we still feasting?

03:06:44.606 --> 03:06:46.259
MATT: Yeah.

03:06:46.259 --> 03:06:48.164
LIAM: So what does that mean? Advantage.

03:06:48.164 --> 03:06:49.867
MARISHA: You have advantage on wisdom throws.

03:06:49.867 --> 03:06:53.442
LIAM: That's better. That is 13.

03:06:53.442 --> 03:07:02.562
MATT: 13? That's better. As you come down, you
take the cape and encase, you trigger the magic,

03:07:02.562 --> 03:07:11.695
at which point the remainder of this doorway just
blinks out entirely, the cape gone. The doorway, gone.

03:07:11.695 --> 03:07:13.607
LIAM: Hot hot hot hot hot.

03:07:13.607 --> 03:07:17.181
MATT: As Vax (splashing) right into the lava.

03:07:17.181 --> 03:07:21.241
MARISHA: I take a Grasping Vine from the edge and
try and yank him back.

03:07:21.241 --> 03:07:25.770
MATT: Okay. You take 22 points of fire damage as
you splat into the lava.

03:07:25.770 --> 03:07:31.443
LIAM: The Deathwalker's Ward is set to fire.

03:07:31.443 --> 03:07:37.437
MATT: So it resisted to 11. So you
(splashing) in the lava. All of a sudden, images

03:07:37.437 --> 03:07:40.555
flash in your head of the time that you lost most
of your foot in the Underdark. And you go--

03:07:40.555 --> 03:07:42.650
LIAM: No no no no no no no no!

03:07:42.650 --> 03:07:45.393
MATT: And, before you can even react, all of a
sudden, something wraps around your waist and

03:07:45.393 --> 03:07:50.780
yanks you out as a vine pulls you in an arc and
slams you into the hard obsidian floor on the

03:07:50.780 --> 03:07:55.656
outside of the lava flow. The rest of you gather
there as the rest of the druids finish their

03:07:55.656 --> 03:08:02.388
concentration. The lava pools themselves have gone
still and you can see elements beginning to cool,

03:08:02.388 --> 03:08:05.753
and there's currently no sign of a tear between
the elemental planes that's

03:08:05.753 --> 03:08:07.776
currently bursting through.

03:08:07.776 --> 03:08:09.419
TRAVIS: Nice job, Vax!

03:08:09.419 --> 03:08:11.231
LIAM: Where am I, am I near her, on the ground?

03:08:11.231 --> 03:08:15.538
MATT: She would be back here. You're on the
ground, right next to a dancing skeleton.

03:08:15.538 --> 03:08:19.181
MARISHA: I moved up, I moved up. I would be over
there.

03:08:19.181 --> 03:08:21.657
MATT: You would be part of the ritual. But you
fell next to the dancing skeleton.

03:08:21.657 --> 03:08:28.086
LIAM: Okay, I look at the skeleton, I look at her.
I look at the skeleton, I look at her.

03:08:28.086 --> 03:08:30.913
I'm an idiot.

03:08:30.913 --> 03:08:38.276
MARISHA: Yeah, no, I already knew that. It's fine.
You did good. You did good. I reach down and I

03:08:38.276 --> 03:08:42.082
help him on his feet. How bad are you?

03:08:42.082 --> 03:08:45.052
LIAM: I'm pretty bad.

03:08:45.052 --> 03:08:50.169
MARISHA: I Cure Wounds, level four.

03:08:50.169 --> 03:08:53.404
TRAVIS: Yeah, cool, do that. I'm going to walk out
of the lava now.

03:08:53.404 --> 03:08:56.183
(laughter)

03:08:56.183 --> 03:09:12.437
MATT: Taking another 21 points of fire damage.
Reduced to ten. The druids look around and give a

03:09:12.437 --> 03:09:16.979
nod of acceptance. All of them acknowledge you,
who they have not met and don't understand quite

03:09:16.979 --> 03:09:22.422
where you came from or why you're here. One of
them, who is currently missing an arm on one hand.

03:09:22.422 --> 03:09:29.402
Dark, weathered skin, long jet black hair cruising
down to the middle of his back, approaches you and

03:09:29.402 --> 03:09:35.313
his one right arm he puts on the shoulder and
says, into your eyes, "I do not know you, friend,

03:09:35.313 --> 03:09:40.259
"but you have come to our aid at an hour when we
really required it."

03:09:40.259 --> 03:09:47.084
CHRIS: Great, sure, I just thought I'd come and
lose a couple of thralls and my fucking broom. But

03:09:47.084 --> 03:09:50.691
great to be here. Everyone seems nice. Especially
her, she's great.

03:09:50.691 --> 03:09:56.035
MATT: He removes his hand. "Very well."

03:09:56.035 --> 03:09:58.515
CHRIS: Let me know if I can do anything else! Do
you want a candle?

03:09:58.515 --> 03:10:00.220
MATT: "Candle?"

03:10:00.220 --> 03:10:03.466
CHRIS: Well, I make candles, just various candles.

03:10:03.466 --> 03:10:09.529
MATT: He does this and his finger bursts into
flame and you can see a flame flickering. "We do

03:10:09.529 --> 03:10:12.241
"not need candles here in Pyrah. But thank you."

03:10:12.241 --> 03:10:16.210
LIAM: Is that the finger? Or is that the finger?

03:10:16.210 --> 03:10:25.390
MATT: Insinuated, actual finger. At this point,
Korren, your father, approaches you and places a

03:10:25.390 --> 03:10:28.985
hand on your shoulder, and turns you around to
look you in the face. And you can see there's

03:10:28.985 --> 03:10:34.916
smears of dirt and still glistening from sweat
from the whole ritual and looks a bit weathered

03:10:34.916 --> 03:10:40.687
and winded from the experience. "Keyleth, I'm
proud of you."

03:10:40.687 --> 03:10:44.642
MARISHA: Thank you, Father.

03:10:44.642 --> 03:10:52.370
MATT: I think we will stay here and help the Pyrah
try and rebuild.

03:10:52.370 --> 03:10:57.140
MARISHA: Oh. Okay.

03:10:57.140 --> 03:11:03.265
MATT: And he takes your chin and pulls it up and
looks you in the face with a broad smile on his

03:11:03.265 --> 03:11:13.161
face, he says, "The road before you, Keyleth, is
hard and fraught with loss and sadness. To live is

03:11:13.161 --> 03:11:21.235
"to struggle against the void. But it's those
moments of darkness that define the joy of the

03:11:21.235 --> 03:11:33.439
"world around them. Learn from the loss and push
forward as a beacon of perseverance, of hope for

03:11:33.439 --> 03:11:43.134
"life after pain. This is one of the pillars of
strength of a leader. One that I have learned with the

03:11:43.134 --> 03:11:53.082
"loss of your mother. But you are my beacon of
hope. And to many more than you even expect." And

03:11:53.082 --> 03:11:57.564
he looks back towards the four other members of the
Zephrah tribe that are all just looking at you,

03:11:57.564 --> 03:11:59.173
and they nod.

03:11:59.173 --> 03:12:03.734
MARISHA: I hope I do not fail you, Father.

03:12:03.734 --> 03:12:14.258
MATT: "I trust you will not. Go forth, while we
stay here. I want you to grasp your destiny,

03:12:14.258 --> 03:12:25.001
"vanquish this terrible beast that lies on the
shores of Tal'Dorei. Complete your Aramente."

03:12:25.001 --> 03:12:28.651
MARISHA: How do you know that this is my destiny?

03:12:28.651 --> 03:12:39.141
MATT: "Whatever your destiny is, grasp it. But
you've chosen this path, and all destiny really

03:12:39.141 --> 03:12:50.709
"is, is the choices you make, leading towards a
goal that perhaps you do not yet understand. But

03:12:50.709 --> 03:12:54.748
"when you've returned I wish for you to teach us
the wisdom you've gained on this journey."

03:12:54.748 --> 03:12:59.447
MARISHA: Kaitiaki, father.

03:12:59.447 --> 03:13:01.471
MATT: "Kaitiaki, Keyleth."

03:13:01.471 --> 03:13:05.088
CHRIS: Did you see a broom lying around anywhere?

03:13:05.088 --> 03:13:08.558
MATT: "No."

03:13:08.558 --> 03:13:11.624
CHRIS: Sorry.

03:13:11.624 --> 03:13:14.608
MATT: "It's all right, we will keep an eye out for
it though."

03:13:14.608 --> 03:13:20.969
CHRIS: Please. And tell everyone #feelthegern.
They'll know what it means.

03:13:20.969 --> 03:13:22.328
SAM: What is a hashtag?

03:13:22.328 --> 03:13:23.394
CHRIS: I'll explain later.

03:13:23.394 --> 03:13:24.854
SAM: All right.

03:13:24.854 --> 03:13:38.933
MATT: "Well, unless there's anything else, we have
business to attend to in restoring this area. I

03:13:38.933 --> 03:13:41.809
"wish you all great luck. "

03:13:41.809 --> 03:13:56.154
MARISHA: Korren, If we should ever need you-- if I
should ever need you, or the assistance of the

03:13:56.154 --> 03:14:00.325
Ashari, what is the best way to get hold of you?

03:14:00.325 --> 03:14:12.130
MATT: "Call to Zephrah. Come home. And we will
come with you." As he looks over all of you,

03:14:12.130 --> 03:14:16.468
giving each a look of-- a nod of respect and
appreciation--

03:14:16.468 --> 03:14:20.591
("Don't You" by Simple Minds plays)

03:14:20.591 --> 03:14:22.029
LIAM: Wow.

03:14:22.029 --> 03:14:23.326
TALIESIN: I felt it coming.

03:14:23.326 --> 03:14:34.405
MATT: Glances past to Grog, Vex, and lingers a
very long look on Vax, and just gives you a nod.

03:14:34.405 --> 03:14:39.176
LAURA: His diamond earring is glistening in the
light.

03:14:39.176 --> 03:14:40.773
MATT: Yeah.

03:14:40.773 --> 03:14:45.205
LIAM: Did I stutter?

03:14:45.205 --> 03:15:00.999
MATT: "Stay safe. For her sake." And Korren turns
around and walks back, as the rest of the Zephrah

03:15:00.999 --> 03:15:10.797
Ashari walk along with him. You, through all this
chaos, get a little bored and frustrated with all

03:15:10.797 --> 03:15:17.562
this weird nonsensical stuff, look at the ground
and realize there's a lot of hidden treasures

03:15:17.562 --> 03:15:20.026
scattered amongst this vicinity.

03:15:20.026 --> 03:15:30.890
CHRIS: Probably so. You know, I might stay behind
a bit and dig around for a little while. You know,

03:15:30.890 --> 03:15:32.790
candlemaking's a difficult business.

03:15:32.790 --> 03:15:33.748
SAM: Is it now?

03:15:33.748 --> 03:15:34.888
CHRIS: Aye.

03:15:34.888 --> 03:15:39.022
TALIESIN: Well, if you're ever looking for more
customers, you'll always find them in Whitestone.

03:15:39.022 --> 03:15:41.330
So, if you make your way north.

03:15:41.330 --> 03:15:42.535
CHRIS: Excellent!

03:15:42.535 --> 03:15:43.888
TALIESIN: You're always welcome.

03:15:43.888 --> 03:15:48.789
CHRIS: Thank you. Could someone heal me a bit
before you leave? I'm quite singed.

03:15:48.789 --> 03:15:50.251
TALIESIN: Oh my!

03:15:50.251 --> 03:15:53.591
LAURA: I walk up and I cast Cure Wounds on him. I've
got jack shit.

03:15:53.591 --> 03:15:55.216
CHRIS: She's so nice!

03:15:55.216 --> 03:15:56.373
SAM: She's great.

03:15:56.373 --> 03:15:57.229
CHRIS: She's the nicest!

03:15:57.229 --> 03:15:58.801
LAURA: At a level three for you!

03:15:58.801 --> 03:16:01.987
CHRIS: That's really nice of you.

03:16:01.987 --> 03:16:03.699
TRAVIS: You're a really good person.

03:16:03.699 --> 03:16:07.551
LAURA: I am! I am. 20 points.

03:16:07.551 --> 03:16:09.199
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

03:16:09.199 --> 03:16:10.554
SAM: Vex?

03:16:10.554 --> 03:16:11.481
LAURA: Yes?

03:16:11.481 --> 03:16:13.857
SAM: This gentleman has done nothing but aid us.

03:16:13.857 --> 03:16:15.887
LAURA: I know, and it's so kind of him.

03:16:15.887 --> 03:16:17.387
SAM: He's suffered the loss of three of his--

03:16:17.387 --> 03:16:20.663
LAURA: Look at all these treasures he's going to
find here for his candles!

03:16:20.663 --> 03:16:22.104
SAM: Is there anything we can do to repay you?

03:16:22.104 --> 03:16:23.974
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:16:23.974 --> 03:16:31.488
TRAVIS: That scimitar that the genie had, did it
fall into the lava?

03:16:31.488 --> 03:16:36.975
MATT: Yes.

03:16:36.975 --> 03:16:38.284
LAURA: 18.

03:16:38.284 --> 03:16:42.233
MATT: As you look down and say "all these
treasures around," you get a closer look. The

03:16:42.233 --> 03:16:48.947
ground here is rugged rock and black ash and dust
and pieces of charred and burnt, petrified wood,

03:16:48.947 --> 03:16:56.497
and right around the outskirts of where the lava
pool is, you can see what look to be broken slivers

03:16:56.497 --> 03:17:08.055
of soot-covered dragon scale just peppered
throughout the landscape. Barely visible until you

03:17:08.055 --> 03:17:14.585
look real close, thanks to the constant barrage of
blacken soot and dust that falls from the nearby area.

03:17:14.585 --> 03:17:20.083
LAURA: Do you collect dragon scales for your
candles?

03:17:20.083 --> 03:17:24.141
CHRIS: Oh, I forgot to tell you. I sold out my own
kind because I was enslaved by dragons who had

03:17:24.141 --> 03:17:27.501
tails who consider themselves royalty and
therefore better than me and I don't have a tail.

03:17:27.501 --> 03:17:32.879
And so I spent my whole life trying to figure out how to
turn scales into weaponized candles. Anyway, got

03:17:32.924 --> 03:17:36.810
to go, everyone have a great time! Thank you!

03:17:36.810 --> 03:17:38.748
MATT: You just leave?

03:17:38.748 --> 03:17:44.186
CHRIS: I leave! Scoop up some of the few scales
and piss off.

03:17:44.186 --> 03:17:52.025
MATT: You guys watch as Gern Blanston begins
walking around and, like a gutter snipe, or one of

03:17:52.025 --> 03:17:55.261
the people on the beach with a metal detector,
starts combing through.

03:17:55.261 --> 03:17:56.720
CHRIS: (singing) Don't you forget about me!

03:17:56.720 --> 03:17:59.877
LAURA: Gern! Before you leave!

03:17:59.877 --> 03:18:00.983
CHRIS: Aye?

03:18:00.983 --> 03:18:05.966
LAURA: You know, we're killing a very, very large
dragon, hopefully rather soon.

03:18:05.966 --> 03:18:08.481
CHRIS: Very interesting! Where would that be?

03:18:08.481 --> 03:18:11.219
LAURA: Well, he's in Emon now, but we're gathering
our forces in Whitestone.

03:18:11.219 --> 03:18:13.978
CHRIS: Good to know! I might catch up with you
later on.

03:18:13.978 --> 03:18:15.025
LAURA: All right!

03:18:15.025 --> 03:18:16.135
CHRIS: Good-bye!

03:18:16.135 --> 03:18:18.177
LAURA: Good-bye!

03:18:18.177 --> 03:18:22.284
MATT: Which she says with a strange doppler effect
even though he's but 20 feet away from you and has

03:18:22.284 --> 03:18:24.795
chosen to ignore the rest of your party to go
about his business.

03:18:24.795 --> 03:18:30.769
CHRIS: It's just like an NPC, just Skyrim.

03:18:30.769 --> 03:18:35.088
MATT: As your skeleton's in the background
dancing.

03:18:35.088 --> 03:18:36.475
CHRIS: There's only one left!

03:18:36.475 --> 03:18:38.124
MATT: Yeah, only one left.

03:18:38.124 --> 03:18:39.582
TALIESIN: He's freezeframe.

03:18:39.582 --> 03:18:43.464
MATT: There's plenty of charred corpses littered
all over this mountaintop you could make undead from.

03:18:43.464 --> 03:18:46.591
TRAVIS: Does the skeleton go with him, or does it
stay?

03:18:46.591 --> 03:18:54.335
MATT: It follows him. All right, so the rest of
you, what is your next course of action?

03:18:54.335 --> 03:19:01.886
LIAM: I sidle up next to my sister and stand there
for a moment and deadpan say, boy, the more things

03:19:01.886 --> 03:19:06.970
change, the more they stay the same. And then I
walk away.

03:19:06.970 --> 03:19:10.501
(laughter)

03:19:10.501 --> 03:19:13.197
TALIESIN: Keyleth, why don't we head home?

03:19:13.197 --> 03:19:14.628
MARISHA: Which home?

03:19:14.628 --> 03:19:15.881
SAM: How do we do that?

03:19:15.881 --> 03:19:16.770
TRAVIS: Whitestone.

03:19:16.770 --> 03:19:19.284
LAURA: Can we get to Whitestone, can you bamf us?

03:19:19.284 --> 03:19:20.638
MARISHA: I can, yeah.

03:19:20.638 --> 03:19:22.160
LAURA: Let's go there and rest up.

03:19:22.160 --> 03:19:23.683
LIAM: Yeah.

03:19:23.683 --> 03:19:28.561
MARISHA: Hey, thank you guys. Thanks for coming,
for helping.

03:19:28.561 --> 03:19:31.111
LAURA: Your dad is very noble.

03:19:31.111 --> 03:19:41.571
SAM: Your homeland is, you know, I mean, the
volcano, the magma, the monsters, the fire torn in

03:19:41.571 --> 03:19:46.745
the sky, it's lovely. It's charming, really.

03:19:46.745 --> 03:19:50.513
MARISHA: Thank you, Scanlan. This isn't my
homeland. I appreciate how well you know me after

03:19:50.513 --> 03:19:51.621
all these years.

03:19:51.621 --> 03:19:53.575
SAM: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you lived here.

03:19:53.575 --> 03:19:55.574
MARISHA: No, this is the Fire Ashari's camp.

03:19:55.574 --> 03:19:57.195
SAM: You're not a Fire Ashari?

03:19:57.195 --> 03:19:59.022
MARISHA: I'm an Air Ashari.

03:19:59.022 --> 03:20:01.393
LIAM: It's all right, it's only been a couple of
years.

03:20:01.393 --> 03:20:03.639
SAM: Aren't all Ashari the same?

03:20:03.639 --> 03:20:08.734
MARISHA: You know what, Scanlan, that might be the
most questions you've ever asked me about myself.

03:20:08.734 --> 03:20:11.487
SAM: I don't even know your last name!

03:20:11.487 --> 03:20:15.503
MARISHA: I don't have one.

03:20:15.503 --> 03:20:18.459
SAM: Hey, what's a hashtag?

03:20:18.459 --> 03:20:21.815
LAURA: Hey, Gern! Gern! Gern! Gern!

03:20:21.815 --> 03:20:23.800
CHRIS: Hello?

03:20:23.800 --> 03:20:28.285
LAURA: Is it just dragon scales, or is it any
dragon parts you use?

03:20:28.285 --> 03:20:34.065
CHRIS: You know, mainly dragon scales, but I do
like to see them blown apart, so that part's

03:20:34.065 --> 03:20:35.552
merely for pleasure.

03:20:35.552 --> 03:20:38.192
TRAVIS: You could give him five pounds of dragon
scales.

03:20:38.192 --> 03:20:43.965
MARISHA: I pick a tree that's big enough to
fit all of our fat faces.

03:20:43.965 --> 03:20:47.507
MATT: You already cast Transport via Plants this
day, that's how you got here.

03:20:47.507 --> 03:20:49.753
MARISHA: Maybe we should rest.

03:20:49.753 --> 03:20:52.486
TRAVIS: Do you need me to help you with the tree
spell?

03:20:52.486 --> 03:20:57.393
LAURA: Maybe we should just sleep here and rest up
and spend the night, wake up in the morning, head

03:20:57.393 --> 03:20:58.732
back to Whitestone.

03:20:58.732 --> 03:21:01.511
TALIESIN: He's going to still be there next week,
by the way.

03:21:01.589 --> 03:21:07.257
MATT: And with that, Vox Machina leaves Gern to
his business as they go and camp out at the base

03:21:07.257 --> 03:21:08.952
of the mountain.

03:21:08.952 --> 03:21:12.507
CHRIS: Did someone lose an orb?

03:21:12.507 --> 03:21:14.376
MATT: And with that, we're going to finish
tonight's game!

03:21:14.376 --> 03:21:18.858
(laughter)

03:21:18.858 --> 03:21:21.113
CHRIS: Can I say something from this realm?

03:21:21.113 --> 03:21:22.300
MATT: Yeah.

03:21:22.300 --> 03:21:26.986
CHRIS: I'm delighted. We showed a thing tonight on
@Midnight of someone lounge singing Stand By Me to

03:21:26.986 --> 03:21:32.721
Donald Trump and putting the name Donald in there,
so I told everyone, please tweet that to @Wilw, and

03:21:32.721 --> 03:21:34.973
people are fucking doing it.

03:21:34.973 --> 03:21:36.457
TRAVIS: That's amazing.

03:21:36.457 --> 03:21:41.232
CHRIS: So, if you find the guy singing a very poor
rendition of Stand by Me to Donald Trump, please

03:21:41.232 --> 03:21:45.864
send it to Wil Wheaton, he'll love it! Favorite
thing in the world!

03:21:45.864 --> 03:21:50.349
MATT: You heard it, guys. Critters' call to
action. Make it happen.

03:21:50.349 --> 03:21:52.482
CHRIS: #FeelTheGern.

03:21:52.482 --> 03:21:53.638
LIAM: CritterStrong.

03:21:53.638 --> 03:21:54.893
SAM: Feel the Gern.

03:21:54.893 --> 03:21:58.958
MATT: All right, well, guys. Chris, thank you so
much for coming and hanging out with us.

03:21:58.958 --> 03:22:00.569
CHRIS: Thank you, this was so much fun!

03:22:00.569 --> 03:22:02.466
TALIESIN: A week without crying!

03:22:02.466 --> 03:22:04.417
TRAVIS: Feel the Gern!

03:22:04.417 --> 03:22:08.056
CHRIS: The best DM in the world! This is a
wonderful party, and you're all fantastic. Thank

03:22:08.056 --> 03:22:10.723
you so much. I'm not even upset that you stole my
broom.

03:22:10.723 --> 03:22:18.853
LAURA: Don't judge me, Scanlan, you didn't see me
do it!

03:22:18.853 --> 03:22:20.697
SAM: I didn't! I didn't!

03:22:20.697 --> 03:22:21.991
LAURA: Sam's just judging.

03:22:21.991 --> 03:22:23.878
SAM: I'm judging you, Laura Bailey.

03:22:23.878 --> 03:22:26.236
(laughter)

03:22:26.236 --> 03:22:27.976
MATT: There is a definite distinction.

03:22:27.976 --> 03:22:30.676
LIAM: Don't worry, everyone will judge you when you take
it out and use it for the first time.

03:22:30.676 --> 03:22:33.521
SAM: Vex is fine. Laura Bailey? Awful.

03:22:33.521 --> 03:22:35.847
TRAVIS: She's wanted to fly so much.

03:22:35.847 --> 03:22:37.727
LIAM: Beat him by one.

03:22:37.727 --> 03:22:43.882
MATT: Well, thank you all so very much for
watching tonight. Hope you enjoyed tonight's

03:22:43.882 --> 03:22:48.382
episode. We return next Thursday, 7PM Pacific time
once again to pick up the next length of Vox

03:22:48.382 --> 03:22:54.708
Machina's journey. Everyone, show your love on
Twitter to Chris, @hardwick. Thank you again for

03:22:54.708 --> 03:23:00.463
coming and being an amazing wizard for all of us.
And is it Thursday yet? See some of you guys

03:23:00.463 --> 03:23:02.498
tomorrow, and if not, next week.

03:23:02.498 --> 03:23:03.960
TRAVIS: Peace out!
