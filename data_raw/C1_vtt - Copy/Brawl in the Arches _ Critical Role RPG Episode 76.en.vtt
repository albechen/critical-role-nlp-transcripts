00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.555
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:11.034
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons. We have quite a quickly

00:00:11.034 --> 00:00:15.513
ramping episode tonight, but before we get to
that, let's go ahead and talk about a few of our

00:00:15.513 --> 00:00:19.107
awesome announcements and sponsors. First up,
tonight's episode is sponsored by our good

00:00:19.107 --> 00:00:21.480
friends, as always, at Loot Crate.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.555
TRAVIS: Loot Crate!

00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:26.972
MATT: Sam, you have a few words on that?

00:00:26.972 --> 00:00:31.945
SAM: Guys! I've got some talking points here. Go

00:00:39.925 --> 00:00:45.856
promo code "Sam reads these ahead of time. Just
kidding, that doesn't exist, but that's what

00:00:45.856 --> 00:00:53.480
"happens when I don't read the notes ahead of
time." That was very funny, crew! Very funny! The

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.796
crew got me!

00:00:54.796 --> 00:00:56.881
MATT: I believe that was actually supplied by Loot
Crate.

00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:58.498
LAURA: No way!

00:00:58.498 --> 00:01:01.835
TRAVIS: That is amazing.

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:04.339
TALIESIN: I can confirm that that is indeed--

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:11.740
SAM: That's amazing! They got me! Well, that's
fine. Well, I had prepared something, should I do

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:20.452
it anyway? All right, I need a little slow snap
from everybody, because this is a beat poem. Here

00:01:20.452 --> 00:01:26.496
it is: Hey daddy-o, you get hip to some knowledge,
it's up from the school of hard knocks, not some

00:01:26.496 --> 00:01:31.720
stuck up college, I know the Man's gonna try to
shut me down, lock me up, send me off to Vietnam,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.917
but I've got to speak the truth, little hepcats
and kittens, because that's who I am. See right

00:01:36.917 --> 00:01:43.510
here is a box of things that corporate America
wants you to buy, wants you to toe the party line!

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.418
Cut your hair, shave your goatee, and subscribe!
But me and the Ginchee guys down at Vitamin

00:01:48.418 --> 00:01:57.718
Village say no, you dig? No to the fat cats, the
stick suits, and the company pigs! We're dragging

00:01:57.718 --> 00:02:03.022
our cigs and take a swig of moonshine. Dump this
crate on the floor and look at this so-called--

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:09.631
actually, it's really cool stuff; it's some really
awesome stuff-- Doctor Strange! That cat is swell!

00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:15.672
Fantastic Beasts looks crazy as hell! The box can
fold out too, and that's jazzy! Ignore what I

00:02:15.672 --> 00:02:21.286
said before, I was just spazzing! So yeah! Loot
Crate, steal my soul, give me a discount, using

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:22.740
CriticalRole!

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.045
(cheering)

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:33.817
MATT: That was ridiculous! Wow!

00:02:33.817 --> 00:02:41.868
TRAVIS: That was the bee's knees, daddy-o! Oh
snap! Hot damn!

00:02:41.868 --> 00:02:43.678
SAM: And they trolled me!

00:02:43.678 --> 00:02:48.292
MATT: And they trolled you. That's fantastic, Sam.
Thank you so much.

00:02:48.292 --> 00:02:50.026
LIAM: Beat poetry-ed us to our death.

00:02:50.026 --> 00:03:01.449
MATT: All righty. Setting up here for the next
bout of announcements. First off, thank you to all

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:06.794
those who tuned in to our first episode of
Talks Machina earlier this week. It's our first

00:03:06.794 --> 00:03:11.786
episode, and as first episodes are usually fraught
with much peril, difficulty-- technical and

00:03:11.786 --> 00:03:19.976
mental. We hit our stride about halfway through, I
felt and I hope you guys enjoyed it. Those will be

00:03:19.976 --> 00:03:24.863
up Thursday at 7:00. We'll have a few cast members come
in and talk to our fantastic host Brian Foster, he

00:03:24.902 --> 00:03:26.844
is fantastic, show him some support.

00:03:26.844 --> 00:03:30.051
TRAVIS: It was so much fun, getting to talk about
all the shit we never actually get to talk about

00:03:30.051 --> 00:03:31.285
with other people.

00:03:31.285 --> 00:03:34.587
MATT: Yeah, me and Marisha had opportunities
every now and then on certain Periscopes to kind

00:03:34.587 --> 00:03:38.884
of chat a little bit in post-game
conversations, really cool to have a space to do

00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:44.642
that. That's the thing, too, guys, please send in
your questions. They're extremely helpful, and I

00:03:44.642 --> 00:03:47.788
like the idea that we can have some great thoughts
without just reading from a chat room that's

00:03:47.788 --> 00:03:49.423
scrolling at a thousand miles per hour.

00:03:49.423 --> 00:03:51.061
LAURA: #AskTalksMachina.

00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:56.545
MATT: Yeah. #AskTalksMachina. Thank you very much!
Laura, do you want to talk about some of the

00:03:56.545 --> 00:03:58.250
things that we have in the store?

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.169
LAURA: Oh, this is so exciting! All right, so
these fabulous bracelets and those pins that you

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:11.823
guys ordered a while ago? Those are shipping out
next week, you guys, so look forward to that!

00:04:11.823 --> 00:04:16.262
You remember the limited edition patches that we
had from Comic Con? We got more of those! So

00:04:16.262 --> 00:04:21.185
those are back in the store tonight, as well as if
you go there right now, you may notice we have a

00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:26.269
limited run of more Gilmore's Glorious Goods
t-shirts, as well as some How Do You Want To Do

00:04:26.269 --> 00:04:33.152
This t-shirts, and I know those are probably going
to sell out pretty fast, but they will be back in

00:04:33.152 --> 00:04:37.374
the store in a couple of weeks, so if you order
now, you might get them before Christmas in a

00:04:37.374 --> 00:04:41.603
couple weeks. I don't know, but we're doing our
best.

00:04:41.603 --> 00:04:43.072
LIAM: You've got to get that unicorn, though.

00:04:43.072 --> 00:04:44.384
LAURA: That unicorn, though.

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:46.248
MARISHA: It's a great shirt.

00:04:46.248 --> 00:04:47.661
TALIESIN: It's my favorite shirt.

00:04:47.661 --> 00:04:51.981
MATT: I spot them every now and then in the wild
and it's one of the weirdest experiences of my

00:04:51.981 --> 00:04:55.772
whole life. "Should I say something? I don't know,
I feel like I should."

00:04:55.772 --> 00:04:59.332
LIAM: Just go (inarticulate noise)--

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:02.398
LAURA: And these ones, these ones are in stock, so
they're not pre-order.

00:05:02.398 --> 00:05:08.926
MATT: Like Donald Sutherland in The Body
Snatchers! Perfect! Perfect. I'll probably do that

00:05:08.926 --> 00:05:13.987
from now on. Next announcement. It
recently kicked off, Patrick Rothfuss started a

00:05:14.046 --> 00:05:17.135
wonderful charity these past couple of years
called World Builders. You can find it at

00:05:17.135 --> 00:05:22.525
worldbuilders.org and he's asked us to help be
part of that process, to promote it, to get the

00:05:22.525 --> 00:05:28.277
word out there and hopefully next year be even
more involved on a physical level. But if you want

00:05:28.277 --> 00:05:32.677
to check it out, it's a fantastic gathering of
authors, writers, and creative minds to help bring

00:05:32.677 --> 00:05:36.770
together those of our community to help make the
world a better place. Go check it out at

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.087
worldbuilders.org, see if it's something you want
to be a part of, donate what you can. It's a

00:05:41.087 --> 00:05:44.855
fantastic cause, and they've done incredible
work these past few years. So we invite you to

00:05:44.855 --> 00:05:49.739
join us as I'm also giving a bunch to it, and
we're helping to keep this promo chain going for

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:55.805
the next month, as long as it's going, so go ahead
and take a look, and be a part of it. Thank you,

00:05:55.805 --> 00:05:58.812
Patrick, for including us in this awesomeness.
We're happy to be a part.

00:05:58.812 --> 00:06:06.711
Also! We have a new round of playlists that have
begun. We did the character playlists last year

00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:11.853
that seemed to go over pretty well. The first one
went up last week with Vax's playlist.

00:06:11.853 --> 00:06:13.133
LIAM: It's hilarious.

00:06:13.133 --> 00:06:14.516
LAURA: You had a song for me, I saw it!

00:06:14.516 --> 00:06:16.096
MATT: It is a knee-slapper.

00:06:16.096 --> 00:06:19.346
LIAM: That's me. That's me.

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:29.765
TRAVIS: Is it really funny, or is it (singing) All
around me are familiar faces. I'll put that one in

00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:31.482
for you on my playlist.

00:06:31.482 --> 00:06:34.546
MATT: It was an awesome playlist, give you even
further insight as to the growth of Vax's

00:06:34.546 --> 00:06:38.652
character over this past year. We have the next
one coming up-- is it yours, Keyleth?

00:06:38.652 --> 00:06:39.955
MARISHA: It's mine!

00:06:39.955 --> 00:06:43.513
MATT: Yeah, we have Keyleth's coming up next. Hell
yeah. We'll be seeing that on the Geek and Sundry

00:06:43.513 --> 00:06:45.526
website, so keep an eye out for that.

00:06:45.526 --> 00:06:46.654
MARISHA: Tomorrow.

00:06:46.654 --> 00:06:48.006
MATT: Indeed.

00:06:48.006 --> 00:06:52.331
LIAM: Tell you what, if I have a super-funny year,
I'll make a super-funny playlist.

00:06:52.331 --> 00:06:53.561
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:06:53.561 --> 00:06:59.853
MATT: They just announced it today, for those
who've been keeping along with Force Grey, which

00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:05.755
we did earlier this year with Dungeons and Dragons
and Nerdist, we finished out on a cliffhanger, and

00:07:05.755 --> 00:07:11.936
now we're going to be finalizing and finishing the
final episode on December 5th, live from the

00:07:11.936 --> 00:07:18.001
Egyptian Theatre here in Hollywood. They put out a
cool poster today designed by the same artist who

00:07:18.001 --> 00:07:24.143
did the Stranger Things cover, and you get to see
me Stranger Things-ified, I guess, if you would,

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:28.797
on the cover. You can check out either my Twitter
or the official Dungeons and Dragons Twitter for

00:07:28.797 --> 00:07:32.003
more information on that as it comes out by
December 5th, it will also be livestreamed, so if

00:07:32.003 --> 00:07:36.516
you can't be there in person, it will be available
on the internet via Twitch for you to watch live,

00:07:36.516 --> 00:07:41.313
at your leisure. Looking forward to that, and hope
you check it out and like it.

00:07:41.313 --> 00:07:47.516
And last but not least, next week is Thanksgiving.
We will not be having an episode next week,

00:07:47.516 --> 00:07:52.279
because we're all going to probably be with our
families and out of town and eating a lot of food

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:57.788
and enjoying the tryptophan. Hope you are doing
the same. We'll miss you guys next week but we'll

00:07:57.788 --> 00:08:02.936
be back the week after at the beginning of
December for the rest of this absolute basket of chaos.

00:08:02.936 --> 00:08:06.705
LAURA: It'll be good. It'll be at a restart, when
we all die.

00:08:06.705 --> 00:08:09.433
MATT: Yeah. It'll give you two weeks to build your
characters, great!

00:08:09.433 --> 00:08:15.576
LIAM: Thanksgiving, we can be thanksful. We can be
thanksful for the campaign we hads, the

00:08:15.576 --> 00:08:20.290
characters we hads, it'll be greats.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.466
TRAVIS: Plurals all around.

00:08:22.466 --> 00:08:30.873
MATT: Without further ado, let's go and jump into
tonight's episode of Critical Role!

00:08:30.873 --> 00:09:59.186
[dramatic music]

00:09:59.186 --> 00:10:06.214
MATT: And welcome back. As we last left off, Vox
Machina, in their trek to take down the Chroma

00:10:06.214 --> 00:10:11.638
Conclave, have been acquiring the Vestiges of
Divergence, ancient artifacts from a long-ago

00:10:11.638 --> 00:10:17.883
historical battle. They've gathered most each and
every one, with one final one remaining. They

00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:25.181
pushed the timeline for their encounter with the
Chroma Conclave forward at a rapid pace, and in

00:10:25.181 --> 00:10:28.801
the process of getting ready for this final
encounter with Thordak, The Cinder King, the

00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:34.359
great, swollen, powerful ancient red dragon who
lords over Emon and Tal'Dorei, you took a trip to

00:10:34.359 --> 00:10:39.065
the Fire Elemental Plane to retrieve the final
Vestige known as the Plate of the Dawnmartyr for

00:10:39.065 --> 00:10:42.108
your fantastic gnome cleric, Pike.

00:10:42.108 --> 00:10:49.215
Upon making your way there to the City of Brass, a
very tyrannical society and a large, ancient city

00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:58.967
run by efreet, you encountered some interesting
characters in Senokir and Uten, a fire genasi and

00:10:58.967 --> 00:11:04.937
a tiefling. Two partnered jewelers that brought
you into their establishment, decided to help you

00:11:04.937 --> 00:11:13.525
out, threw you in chains to give the image of you
being slaves to his business. Brought you guys to

00:11:13.525 --> 00:11:18.757
speak to a number of the currently free fire giants in
the city, as apparently the armor belonged or was

00:11:18.757 --> 00:11:20.221
won by a fire giant.

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:25.531
You managed to, upon asking one named Whaska, got
the information and sent you to Juuraiel, a gambler

00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:29.334
and very well-off fire giant, one of the few
responsible for selling the rest of their

00:11:29.334 --> 00:11:34.297
people into slavery here within the City of Brass,
in which a card game was not won.

00:11:34.297 --> 00:11:37.275
SAM: It was this close!

00:11:37.275 --> 00:11:39.130
MATT: This close every single time!

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.339
SAM: Yeah!

00:11:40.339 --> 00:11:45.212
MATT: That was kind of absurd. However, you were
given the option, as opposed to now having sold

00:11:45.212 --> 00:11:49.039
yourselves into slavery to the giant, to instead
do this grand favor for them. Apparently, the

00:11:49.039 --> 00:11:57.513
past lover of this giant was killed in the streets
by a pit fiend named Ghurrix who occasionally

00:11:57.513 --> 00:12:02.236
wanders the slave district called the Arches here
in the City of Brass. You agreed to go find and

00:12:02.236 --> 00:12:08.159
kill this pit fiend out of vengeance for the giant
and as such you would be freed from your current

00:12:08.159 --> 00:12:13.345
onus and be given the armor that is in the
possession of Juuraiel, this giant, as well, so

00:12:13.345 --> 00:12:21.500
everything should be great. You guys applied a
Seeming enchantment across the party, allowing

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:27.223
most of you to look kind of like copies of Vex and
Vax, the sexy sextuplets, as you put it. The kind

00:12:27.223 --> 00:12:34.935
of things you'd want to purchase. Made your way to
the slave market called the Arches, with Scanlan

00:12:34.935 --> 00:12:45.141
Shorthalt disguised as a flame-wreathed azer, a
Fire Plane dwarf. You proceeded to try and sell

00:12:45.141 --> 00:12:52.437
this party to the pit fiend, Ghurrix, as he walked
through the area. After acquiring and purchasing

00:12:52.437 --> 00:12:58.697
two celestial-blooded boys who were on another
slavery block.

00:12:58.697 --> 00:13:00.464
LIAM: Altar boys.

00:13:00.464 --> 00:13:06.115
MATT: That's disgusting. Bait. And it was bait and
it's worked out well so far as it got the

00:13:06.115 --> 00:13:10.179
attention of the pit fiend. The pit fiend wandered
to where you had set the entrance to your

00:13:10.179 --> 00:13:16.459
mansion, Scanlan. Upon some conversation,
seemingly were unable to convince the pit fiend to

00:13:16.459 --> 00:13:25.186
suddenly step into this unsafe, spectral doorway
that you had attempted to coax him into. As many

00:13:25.186 --> 00:13:31.231
of you emerged into the street, with Pike and
Percy hiding within the mansion, the rest of you

00:13:31.231 --> 00:13:37.614
set the stage here at the mouth of this alleyway,
the nearby bubbling of a lava stream just off to

00:13:37.614 --> 00:13:44.600
the right side of you. Keyleth, hidden in the back
of the alleyway, decided that, while this moment

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.180
was still tense, to use the element of surprise
and attempted to Feeblemind the pit fiend.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:54.970
Unfortunately, it was resisted by the creature,
who then, as an instinctive reaction, summoned a

00:13:54.970 --> 00:14:02.302
friend known as an erinyes from the Nine Hells to
join Ghurrix at his side. And that is where we

00:14:02.302 --> 00:14:06.152
left off. We're going to bring up some boss music
here.

00:14:06.152 --> 00:14:08.103
LIAM: Props to that set, though.

00:14:08.103 --> 00:14:10.956
LAURA: This set is amazing.

00:14:10.956 --> 00:14:16.620
MATT: Seeing as how we're in the Fire Elemental
Plane, I think it's important that we have some

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.447
proper Fire Elemental Plane lighting.

00:14:19.447 --> 00:14:26.114
LIAM: Ghurrix, would you like to phone a friend?

00:14:26.114 --> 00:14:29.801
MATT: Would you like to phone a friend? That's not
going to help.

00:14:29.801 --> 00:14:32.520
MARISHA: So the blue thing is the magical door?

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:40.351
MATT: To give you guys some context, set-wise.
This is the doorway, the entrance to Scanlan's

00:14:40.351 --> 00:14:45.267
mansion. Big as the doorway you could have made.
Back here is Keyleth, who had fired off the spell.

00:14:45.267 --> 00:14:52.194
Here we have Vex and Trinket, who you had popped
out, as well as Vax, who had just stepped out of

00:14:52.194 --> 00:14:54.534
the portal. Scanlan, with in front of you, the two
boys.

00:14:54.534 --> 00:14:57.975
LAURA: In front of him?! They were in front of
him?

00:14:57.975 --> 00:14:59.764
SAM: We were sending them off to be sold.

00:14:59.764 --> 00:15:02.110
LAURA: Yeah, but I thought you were holding out
the chain and they were standing behind you.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.156
SAM: No, I was holding the chain and they stepped
forward.

00:15:04.156 --> 00:15:09.754
MATT: And Grog was off here to the side. Here we
have Ghurrix himself as well as his ally companion

00:15:09.754 --> 00:15:14.449
and a number of other slavers and/or slaves that
currently line the streets as part of this, who

00:15:14.449 --> 00:15:17.613
are now watching as this conflict may seem to
erupt here.

00:15:17.613 --> 00:15:24.071
SAM: Narrator slash Dungeon Master? What are those
guards? There's guards in the city.

00:15:24.071 --> 00:15:27.411
LAURA: I looked for them the last game, and
they're not around right now.

00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:30.704
MATT: There are efreet. You didn't see any around
at the moment, no. And they are called the

00:15:30.704 --> 00:15:31.753
Illuminated.

00:15:31.753 --> 00:15:33.448
TRAVIS: Does his companion have a name?

00:15:33.448 --> 00:15:36.292
MATT: You don't know. You can certainly ask.

00:15:36.292 --> 00:15:42.646
LIAM: And what's behind the pit fiend where the
map disappears? Is there building there or what?

00:15:42.646 --> 00:15:48.318
MATT: There is an edge to a building there and
part of a thoroughfare walkway.

00:15:48.318 --> 00:15:50.110
LIAM: How many stories is the building behind
them?

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:53.031
MATT: I'd say probably two stories.

00:15:53.031 --> 00:15:58.795
SAM: Is that building made of sharp spikes that if
we destroyed the building it would kill the bad guy?

00:15:58.795 --> 00:16:03.065
MATT: Probably not. However, I would like to ask
you all to roll initiative.

00:16:03.065 --> 00:16:06.776
SAM: A lot going on this roll.

00:16:06.776 --> 00:16:16.483
MARISHA: Oh, natural 20! I don't know what to do
with that in this situation.

00:16:16.483 --> 00:16:24.129
MATT: All righty, so looking at how things stand
here, currently, 25 to 20?

00:16:24.129 --> 00:16:25.745
MARISHA: 22.

00:16:25.745 --> 00:16:27.753
LAURA: 24.

00:16:27.753 --> 00:16:29.113
MATT: 24, okay.

00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:31.505
LAURA: I rolled for Pike, too. Is that right?

00:16:31.505 --> 00:16:34.036
MATT: Yeah. What's Pike's roll?

00:16:34.036 --> 00:16:35.966
LAURA: She's going to kill me.

00:16:35.966 --> 00:16:45.053
MATT: Natural one? So Pike is at the bottom.
Rolling in character for her. That's great. Great.

00:16:45.053 --> 00:16:47.243
20 to 15?

00:16:47.243 --> 00:16:48.364
LIAM: 19.

00:16:48.364 --> 00:16:51.688
TRAVIS: Also 19. Yeah, baby.

00:16:51.688 --> 00:16:55.332
LAURA: But you know what? That'll give her more
time to get into the game.

00:16:55.332 --> 00:16:59.164
MATT: Hold on, so Grog and Vax 19. Percy?

00:16:59.164 --> 00:17:00.188
TALIESIN: 18.

00:17:00.188 --> 00:17:01.415
MATT: 18?

00:17:01.415 --> 00:17:04.837
TALIESIN: It's not good for me.

00:17:04.837 --> 00:17:10.832
MATT: All right, Scanlan, what did you get?

00:17:10.832 --> 00:17:12.083
SAM: 13.

00:17:12.083 --> 00:17:13.177
MATT: 13.

00:17:13.177 --> 00:17:14.959
SAM: I'll be dead by the time I go.

00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:22.404
MATT: Perfect. Given that standpoint, we are at
the top of the combat round. You watch as the pit

00:17:22.404 --> 00:17:28.790
fiend's wings unfurl. The jaw clenches as the
fangs, now protruding from underneath its demonic

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:33.550
visage, it looks past all of you into the
alleyway, the source of the magic that seemed to

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:42.073
affect it now its current intent. The other, the
devilish female that stepped through the brief

00:17:42.073 --> 00:17:47.375
portal, her wings unfurled, floating gently off
the ground, holding the longsword in one hand, a

00:17:47.375 --> 00:17:53.951
longbow strewn over her shoulder, and some sort of
strange wound rope or lasso on her belt side.

00:17:53.951 --> 00:17:59.334
Fully armored, now looking intently as to what her
next target is going to be. Vex, you are at the top.

00:17:59.334 --> 00:18:00.447
LAURA: I'm the top?

00:18:00.447 --> 00:18:01.629
MATT: You're the top. 24!

00:18:01.629 --> 00:18:06.328
LAURA: Oh Jesus. Oh my god. Okay.

00:18:06.328 --> 00:18:07.799
MARISHA: What are we doing?

00:18:07.799 --> 00:18:13.466
LAURA: Number one, I'm going to yell at the boys
to run back into the mansion.

00:18:13.466 --> 00:18:15.725
MATT: Okay.

00:18:15.725 --> 00:18:26.068
LAURA: (nervous laughter) I hadn't thought this
much yet because I didn't know I was going to be

00:18:26.068 --> 00:18:35.267
first. I'm going to-- Homina, homina. I'm going to
Hunter's Mark.

00:18:35.267 --> 00:18:36.994
MATT: Hunter's Mark?

00:18:36.994 --> 00:18:38.499
LAURA: The pit fiend.

00:18:38.499 --> 00:18:39.980
MATT: All righty.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.133
TRAVIS: Ghorrix?

00:18:41.133 --> 00:18:42.193
MATT: Ghurrix.

00:18:42.193 --> 00:18:58.317
LAURA: And I have a question. If I do the Bramble
Shot, does it do the damage straight up, and then

00:18:58.317 --> 00:19:00.280
if they do the strength save then it doesn't--

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.173
MATT: Correct. You still have to roll to hit, but
then when it hits, it does the damage, and then

00:19:03.173 --> 00:19:05.110
the strength save is to see if it's restrained or
not.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:16.541
LAURA: Okay. So I'm going to tell Trinket to move
up next to him.

00:19:16.541 --> 00:19:25.189
MATT: Okay, Trinket rushes through. Trinket comes
charging upward. (roars)

00:19:25.189 --> 00:19:30.456
LAURA: Yeah, and can I do Bramble Shot as one of
my attacks and then do another regular attack? Is

00:19:30.456 --> 00:19:31.787
that the way it works?

00:19:31.787 --> 00:19:33.080
MATT: What's it say for the specific ability?

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.332
LAURA: It just says Bramble Shot.

00:19:34.332 --> 00:19:36.001
MATT: So yeah, one of your attacks would be a
Bramble Shot.

00:19:36.001 --> 00:19:37.875
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try to do the Bramble
Shot on it.

00:19:37.875 --> 00:19:38.963
MATT: All right, go for it.

00:19:38.963 --> 00:19:41.830
LAURA: Okay, that doesn't work.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.445
MATT: What did you roll?

00:19:43.445 --> 00:19:44.392
LAURA: A one.

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:45.622
MATT: A natural one again?

00:19:45.622 --> 00:19:46.693
LAURA: Two ones.

00:19:46.693 --> 00:19:48.229
TRAVIS: Where's your dice jail?

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:51.561
LAURA: I don't know. The dice jail was in the
thing; it's not here!

00:19:51.561 --> 00:19:56.900
MATT: Bramble Shot goes wide, swooping past it and
slamming into the building behind it. You watch as

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:01.371
the arrow explodes and a series of vines tangle
outward and wrap around the side of the building.

00:20:01.371 --> 00:20:04.241
LAURA: Cool. This is off to a really awesome
start.

00:20:04.241 --> 00:20:05.695
TRAVIS: Come on, captain, let's go.

00:20:05.695 --> 00:20:08.240
LAURA: I'm going to just try to shoot him.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.600
MATT: All right.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.217
LAURA: 25?

00:20:11.217 --> 00:20:12.505
MATT: All righty.

00:20:12.505 --> 00:20:13.580
LAURA: Does that hit him?

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.789
MATT: 25 hits, yeah.

00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:33.056
LAURA: Okay, good. 14, 16, 17, 18, plus 2d6
because Trinket's standing next to him. 25.

00:20:33.056 --> 00:20:48.360
MATT: 25 damage. All right. You already used your
bonus action to Hunter's Mark, so he cannot. All

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.658
right. Do you wish to move?

00:20:49.658 --> 00:20:54.218
LAURA: Yes. I want to back up into the alley.

00:20:54.218 --> 00:20:55.639
MATT: Okay.

00:20:55.639 --> 00:21:01.679
LAURA: Can I hide behind that building right
there? In that little crevice?

00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:04.465
MATT: Yeah, you can go ahead and dive into that
little alcove there.

00:21:04.465 --> 00:21:05.338
LAURA: Okay.

00:21:05.338 --> 00:21:10.160
MATT: I'll put you just slightly in there. And
there you are. You're not quite hidden but you're

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.447
peeking around the side.

00:21:11.447 --> 00:21:14.344
LAURA: How many feet away am I from them?

00:21:14.344 --> 00:21:16.167
MATT: From Ghurrix?

00:21:16.167 --> 00:21:17.415
LAURA: From Trinket.

00:21:17.415 --> 00:21:23.627
MATT: Oh, from Trinket you are roughly 40. A
little over 40 feet away. All right?

00:21:23.627 --> 00:21:24.884
LAURA: Thank you.

00:21:24.884 --> 00:21:26.512
MATT: No worries. That's your turn. Keyleth, you're
up.

00:21:26.512 --> 00:21:28.725
LAURA: My shitty turn!

00:21:28.725 --> 00:21:31.261
SAM: That was great. You killed him.

00:21:31.261 --> 00:21:35.182
MARISHA: Where's his friend that he summoned?

00:21:35.182 --> 00:21:36.512
MATT: Right next to him.

00:21:36.512 --> 00:21:37.901
MARISHA: The little winged thing?

00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:39.947
SAM: Yeah, it's like a parrot on a pirate's
shoulder.

00:21:39.947 --> 00:21:46.274
MARISHA: Okay, and this guy over here, who's like
(growls). Is he angry at us, too?

00:21:46.274 --> 00:21:52.154
MATT: No. He's currently standing next to this
block with a slave that's in chains that it's

00:21:52.154 --> 00:21:55.541
holding the chain to and was in the middle of
barking before all of a sudden it watched this

00:21:55.541 --> 00:21:56.549
summoning happen.

00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:58.050
MARISHA: Okay, so he's just like "Fight!" Okay.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.941
MATT: He's looking over right now and watching
curiously about what's going down.

00:22:00.941 --> 00:22:06.213
MARISHA: Is the pit fiend considered huge or
large?

00:22:06.213 --> 00:22:07.166
MATT: Large.

00:22:07.166 --> 00:22:08.203
MARISHA: Large.

00:22:08.203 --> 00:22:09.311
SAM: And in charge.

00:22:09.311 --> 00:22:19.255
MARISHA: Okay, and then this is lava? Oh Jesus.
I'm shaking. Okay. I'm going to cast Watery Sphere

00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:21.082
right on their faces.

00:22:21.082 --> 00:22:25.342
SAM: Just get them all wet. Go (blubs).

00:22:25.342 --> 00:22:28.500
MATT: Watery Sphere.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.458
MARISHA: They both have to make strength saving
throws.

00:22:31.458 --> 00:22:34.463
SAM: Or else they're wet? What happens?

00:22:34.463 --> 00:22:36.783
MARISHA: Or else they are restrained.

00:22:36.783 --> 00:22:38.577
SAM: Ooh, in water.

00:22:38.577 --> 00:22:39.740
MARISHA: In water.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.392
MATT: All right. So we'll use this as the Watery
Sphere.

00:22:42.392 --> 00:22:47.915
We'll set it facing right there. All right.
What's the save they have to make?

00:22:47.915 --> 00:22:50.394
MARISHA: Strength.

00:22:50.394 --> 00:22:53.547
MATT: Both of them have to make a strength saving
throw. All righty.

00:22:53.547 --> 00:22:56.173
MARISHA: I'm so nervous!

00:22:56.173 --> 00:22:59.516
MATT: That is a 21 for the pit fiend. What's the
DC?

00:22:59.516 --> 00:23:00.681
MARISHA: 19.

00:23:00.681 --> 00:23:02.087
MATT: 19, so it succeeds.

00:23:02.087 --> 00:23:03.814
TRAVIS: That was strength, too?

00:23:03.814 --> 00:23:11.508
MATT: The erinyes makes an eight. She does not
succeed. While the sphere seems to splatter and

00:23:11.508 --> 00:23:16.833
try and encompass the pit fiend, it is unaffected
by the torrent of water. However, the winged

00:23:16.833 --> 00:23:20.595
erinyes, who's floating in the air, seems to be
pulled into it and is now thrashing about within

00:23:20.595 --> 00:23:21.846
the water itself.

00:23:21.846 --> 00:23:23.100
LAURA: Good job.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.465
MARISHA: Can I now move it now?

00:23:25.465 --> 00:23:27.227
MATT: You conjure the sphere--

00:23:27.227 --> 00:23:34.875
MARISHA: It says as an action I can move the
sphere up to 30 feet.

00:23:34.875 --> 00:23:46.828
MATT: From what I can see right here, no. You
create the sphere and they are restrained, and

00:23:46.828 --> 00:23:49.365
then future turns, as an action, you can move it.

00:23:49.365 --> 00:23:51.024
MARISHA: Okay.

00:23:51.024 --> 00:23:52.452
SAM: Nice!

00:23:52.452 --> 00:23:54.169
MARISHA: It's restrained.

00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:55.821
SAM: You got some bonus shit to do?

00:23:55.821 --> 00:23:59.217
MARISHA: Not right now. I'm going to wait.

00:23:59.217 --> 00:24:00.818
TRAVIS: You got some bonus shit to do?

00:24:00.818 --> 00:24:03.503
SAM: Yo, you got some bonus shit?

00:24:03.503 --> 00:24:05.497
MATT: You know, some bonus shit?

00:24:05.497 --> 00:24:07.682
MARISHA: On my good days, I always have bonus shit
to do.

00:24:07.682 --> 00:24:09.096
MATT: Is that your turn? Are you going to move?

00:24:09.096 --> 00:24:18.916
MARISHA: Can I hug around the corner a little?
Hide a bit?

00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:20.224
MATT: Sure.

00:24:20.224 --> 00:24:24.115
MARISHA: Just a little tuck in. Yeah, that's good.
That's good. I don't want to like lose too much

00:24:24.115 --> 00:24:25.377
visual. Yeah, that's good.

00:24:25.377 --> 00:24:26.569
MATT: All righty.

00:24:26.569 --> 00:24:28.212
MARISHA: Yep.

00:24:28.212 --> 00:24:31.175
MATT: All right, that end your turn? All right,
that brings us to Vax.

00:24:31.175 --> 00:24:32.689
LIAM: We're tied?

00:24:32.689 --> 00:24:36.570
MATT: You're both tied. You and Grog are both at
the same initiative level, so you both go at the

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:38.370
same time, but it's up to you who goes first.

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:39.872
LIAM: Let the big man go first.

00:24:39.872 --> 00:24:48.308
TRAVIS: I want to light this candle and get the
party started! I would like to fiery rage. And can

00:24:48.308 --> 00:24:52.395
I bust out in a straight sprint towards the pit
fiend?

00:24:52.395 --> 00:24:53.926
MATT: That you can.

00:24:53.926 --> 00:24:58.737
TRAVIS: And in the immortal words of Bob Ross,
"Everybody needs a friend," and I want to give him

00:24:58.737 --> 00:25:03.242
a big fucking bear hug. And I would like to try and
grapple him, if I could.

00:25:03.242 --> 00:25:05.326
MATT: Yes. We can totally do that.

00:25:05.326 --> 00:25:08.773
TRAVIS: I can grapple a creature one size larger
than myself.

00:25:08.773 --> 00:25:10.296
MATT: That you can.

00:25:10.296 --> 00:25:12.636
MARISHA: Get these fuckers locked down.

00:25:12.636 --> 00:25:16.907
LIAM: DND Bob Ross reference is like Playstation
trophies.

00:25:16.907 --> 00:25:26.745
MATT: It's how it's supposed to be, man. Just
saying. Your grapple can replace an attack, as we

00:25:26.745 --> 00:25:29.252
said before. So go ahead and make a strength
athletics check.

00:25:29.252 --> 00:25:31.534
TRAVIS: And I have advantage on these because I'm
raging.

00:25:31.534 --> 00:25:32.966
MATT: Correct.

00:25:32.966 --> 00:25:40.008
TRAVIS: 15, nine. 23.

00:25:40.008 --> 00:25:46.662
MATT: 22. Moving up, you have him currently
grappled.

00:25:46.662 --> 00:25:48.242
TRAVIS and LAURA: Great.

00:25:48.242 --> 00:25:49.565
SAM: Okay.

00:25:49.565 --> 00:25:50.964
MARISHA: They're both grappled.

00:25:50.964 --> 00:25:52.917
SAM: Let's all leave except for Grog.

00:25:52.917 --> 00:25:56.662
TRAVIS: That replaces an attack?

00:25:56.662 --> 00:26:00.795
MATT: You currently have him grappled with your
arm right now.

00:26:00.795 --> 00:26:03.850
SAM: We'll tell your story, Grog.

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:10.694
TRAVIS: Can I revisit the days of the Crucible and
can I try and suplex this motherfucker onto his side?

00:26:10.694 --> 00:26:13.364
MATT: You know what, sure. Why not?

00:26:13.364 --> 00:26:17.626
TRAVIS: I want to! Just to get him prone, also.

00:26:17.626 --> 00:26:21.064
MATT: Yeah, because currently I'd say for the
purposes of the grapple, because it takes you all

00:26:21.064 --> 00:26:23.826
of your strength to do so, you would not be able to
attack with your axe while you have him grappled.

00:26:23.826 --> 00:26:33.475
That wouldn't function. You have him grappled. Go
ahead and make another athletics check.

00:26:33.475 --> 00:26:35.120
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.278
LIAM: Get it girl. Get it.

00:26:37.278 --> 00:26:39.887
TRAVIS: 19.

00:26:39.887 --> 00:26:49.392
MATT: He rolled a 17 plus eight. So that is a 25,
so no. As you attempt to lift, these giant devil

00:26:49.392 --> 00:26:55.858
claws jam into the side of your shoulders. And as
the pain hits, it forces you down, and you can't

00:26:55.858 --> 00:26:58.703
get enough lift. His wings are just too big. He's
too dense.

00:26:58.703 --> 00:27:00.903
TRAVIS: But I'm still giving him love, right?

00:27:00.903 --> 00:27:03.472
MATT: You're still holding onto him. All righty.

00:27:03.472 --> 00:27:04.805
TRAVIS: That ends my turn.

00:27:04.805 --> 00:27:05.997
MATT: All right, that ends Grog's turn.

00:27:05.997 --> 00:27:07.768
LIAM: Okay, I'm standing right in front of Scanlan.
Right?

00:27:07.768 --> 00:27:10.104
MATT: Yes, you are. Well, you're right next to
him.

00:27:10.104 --> 00:27:12.986
LIAM: Right next to him? All right, I'm going to
take my hand and palm him by the face and cast

00:27:12.986 --> 00:27:19.252
Heroism on him. That's the first action. First,
I'm going click my Boots of Haste. Which they've

00:27:19.252 --> 00:27:25.943
seen me for the last 30 minutes. We slept. I put
my boots on. I've not been invisible all day. I

00:27:25.943 --> 00:27:32.398
slap my hand on his face, cast Heroism, then I
cast it on myself, then I'm going to take to the

00:27:32.398 --> 00:27:39.489
air and fly up and over them and behind them and
hover over the building behind them. Maybe we

00:27:39.489 --> 00:27:44.385
should just imagine it, because I want to go
off the table. And throw Whisper at the back of

00:27:44.446 --> 00:27:51.086
his fucking head from about 40 feet in the air.
Directly behind him.

00:27:51.086 --> 00:27:55.602
MATT: Back that way? We'll say for the purposes of
this, you're back behind him.

00:27:55.602 --> 00:27:56.970
LIAM: All right.

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:58.889
MATT: Okay, so how far up did you fly?

00:27:58.889 --> 00:28:06.520
LIAM: I'm going to do 50 feet. Above his head,
back a little bit, and right into his head. That

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:13.948
diagonal line is probably just the edge of 60. And
since Grog is hugging him, it's sneak attack, and

00:28:13.948 --> 00:28:24.736
he's grappled, which means I have advantage, so it
is 25. Which should hit if I was paying attention

00:28:24.736 --> 00:28:39.439
to the ACs. Two, we'll say is ten, plus the sneak
attack damage is 15, 18, 22, 25, 28, 31, 35 plus

00:28:39.439 --> 00:28:46.082
the psychic damage. 35 plus-- I need an eight.
Somebody give me an eight. Where's an eight? 38.

00:28:46.082 --> 00:28:55.137
MATT: 38, gotcha. All right, that ends your turn?

00:28:55.137 --> 00:29:03.215
LIAM: No, then I'm going to fly an additional--
because I'm hasted, I can go 120 feet. I'm going

00:29:03.215 --> 00:29:06.887
to go up another 40 feet. No. I'm going to stay
where I am. Stay where I am.

00:29:06.887 --> 00:29:10.366
SAM: Am I heroic now? What does that mean? What do
I do?

00:29:10.366 --> 00:29:14.964
LIAM: Every round, because my charisma bonus is
not that high, you get two hit points every round.

00:29:14.964 --> 00:29:17.839
SAM: I add two hit points to myself?

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:20.683
LIAM: You get them back. Yeah. Do they go up?

00:29:20.683 --> 00:29:23.659
SAM: I get two hit points back.

00:29:23.659 --> 00:29:29.502
LIAM: Temporary hit points. Yeah. They go up. Does
he get them now, or does it start next round?

00:29:29.502 --> 00:29:32.402
MATT: Let me go look up your spell.

00:29:32.402 --> 00:29:35.160
LIAM: The wording is unclear on my card.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:39.224
MATT: Until the spell ends, the creature is immune
to being frightened and gains temporary hit points

00:29:39.224 --> 00:29:42.256
equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the
start of each of its turns. At the start of your

00:29:42.256 --> 00:29:44.688
turn, you get--

00:29:44.688 --> 00:29:46.165
LIAM: Two. Just two.

00:29:46.165 --> 00:29:51.630
SAM: And I'm immune to fright. (cackles) Like
always.

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:57.528
MATT: Basically. All righty. That ends your turn.
Percy, you're up. You're currently inside

00:29:57.528 --> 00:30:02.474
Scanlan's mansion. Last thing you saw was Scanlan
reach out and go "Fucking jenga!" and then

00:30:02.474 --> 00:30:04.385
disappear back into the doorway.

00:30:04.385 --> 00:30:09.710
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to look out the door.
What do I see when I look out the door?

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:16.452
MATT: You look out the door. You see the two
chained celestial-blooded boys standing there

00:30:16.452 --> 00:30:21.069
looking confused and frightened. You see Scanlan
holding their chains from behind currently

00:30:21.069 --> 00:30:27.774
glancing up as Vax has darted off, winged, and has
begun throwing daggers from the air 50 feet up and

00:30:27.774 --> 00:30:31.490
behind where the pit fiend is. That's what you
see.

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:43.543
TALIESIN: I'm going to take some shots from inside
the mansion at the pit fiend, and then I'm going

00:30:43.543 --> 00:30:45.419
to duck away from the door again.

00:30:45.419 --> 00:30:47.488
LAURA: Best place to be right now.

00:30:47.488 --> 00:30:52.288
TALIESIN: I'm not going to step out of the
doorway. I'm going to step in. I'm in the doorway still.

00:30:52.288 --> 00:30:56.207
MATT: Sure. Your hand is out of the doorway.
Cool. Go for it.

00:30:56.207 --> 00:31:04.382
TALIESIN: Very specific about that. Here we go.
First shot. Oh, before I do anything, I'm going to

00:31:04.382 --> 00:31:16.802
cast Hex on the pit demon, giving him a strength
disadvantage.

00:31:16.802 --> 00:31:19.257
MATT: Okay. Strength ability checks.

00:31:19.257 --> 00:31:28.462
TALIESIN: And here we go. First shot. Oh god.
Don't do anything stupid. Okay. That's fine. 22 to hit.

00:31:28.462 --> 00:31:29.855
MATT: 22 hits.

00:31:29.855 --> 00:31:33.949
LAURA: I was like (heavy breathing).

00:31:33.949 --> 00:31:35.793
TALIESIN: I am so not together.

00:31:35.793 --> 00:31:41.678
SAM: Guys, we're winning! He hasn't even done
anything. He's pretty weak. He's just sitting

00:31:41.678 --> 00:31:43.633
there, taking it. Just sitting there.

00:31:43.633 --> 00:31:47.000
TRAVIS: That red light on Matt's face is so
telling.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.028
LAURA: You're too scary right now, Matt

00:31:49.028 --> 00:31:50.854
TRAVIS: Don't raise your eyebrows like that.

00:31:50.854 --> 00:31:53.213
LAURA: Yeah. Don't intentionally look scary.

00:31:53.213 --> 00:31:59.483
TALIESIN: That's not bad. That's 15 points of
damage, plus six points of psychic, plus four

00:31:59.483 --> 00:32:01.079
points of necrotic damage.

00:32:01.079 --> 00:32:04.701
MATT: Okay. 15 plus four?

00:32:04.701 --> 00:32:06.236
TALIESIN: 15 plus six plus four.

00:32:06.236 --> 00:32:07.691
MATT: Okay, good.

00:32:07.691 --> 00:32:18.706
TALIESIN: Next shot. Let's go Sharpshooter. See
what happens. Yay. 26 to hit.

00:32:18.706 --> 00:32:20.673
MATT: 26 hits. Yep.

00:32:20.673 --> 00:32:30.032
TALIESIN: I'm shaking more than normal. Oh, that's
good. Oh shit. That's really good.

00:32:30.032 --> 00:32:31.449
MARISHA: That's a Percy roll.

00:32:31.449 --> 00:32:40.332
TALIESIN: Holy fuck, that's a Percy roll. 26
points of damage, four points of psychic damage,

00:32:40.332 --> 00:32:46.791
and six points of necrotic damage. That's
stacking. I'm not breaking it up. All of these are stacked.

00:32:46.791 --> 00:32:48.365
MATT: All righty. Good.

00:32:48.365 --> 00:32:51.453
TALIESIN: Because I don't know if the necrotic and
the psychic are doing full damage to him, so I'm

00:32:51.453 --> 00:32:54.206
trying to break them up for you. I'm going to do
that again.

00:32:54.206 --> 00:32:55.851
LIAM: Magic guns are dangerous.

00:32:55.851 --> 00:33:05.703
TALIESIN: (laughs) And here we go for the final
roll for this attack. Pew pew. And that's

00:33:05.703 --> 00:33:09.781
again. That's really good. That's 29 to hit.

00:33:09.781 --> 00:33:10.935
MATT: That hits.

00:33:10.935 --> 00:33:13.206
TALIESIN: I do not do that crit thing now. Not
yet.

00:33:13.206 --> 00:33:17.042
MATT: Not yet. First round is going good for you
guys.

00:33:17.042 --> 00:33:23.084
TALIESIN: This is also good. That's 28 points of
normal damage, five points of psychic and three

00:33:23.084 --> 00:33:24.360
points of necrotic.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.861
MATT: What was it again?

00:33:25.861 --> 00:33:35.329
TALIESIN: 28 points of normal damage. Five points
of psychic damage. Three points of necrotic

00:33:35.329 --> 00:33:41.535
damage. And now I'm going to hide behind. I'm
going to like spin around and get inside the

00:33:41.535 --> 00:33:43.229
doorway and back the fuck off.

00:33:43.229 --> 00:33:48.542
MATT: Okay. Good to know. That ends Percy's turn.
That brings us to the pit fiend.

00:33:48.542 --> 00:33:50.907
SAM: Pit fiend's turn.

00:33:50.907 --> 00:33:52.128
MATT: Let's see here.

00:33:52.128 --> 00:33:56.545
LIAM: Let's see here, how can I kill them? Kill
them all at once. Kill them one at a time. Kill

00:33:56.545 --> 00:33:59.491
them in an embarrassing way.

00:33:59.491 --> 00:34:04.637
TRAVIS: Don't. No. Leave the book out. There's a
rule that says you can't look at the book once

00:34:04.637 --> 00:34:06.739
your turn has started.

00:34:06.739 --> 00:34:08.714
LIAM: Cut the feed. Cut the feed!

00:34:08.714 --> 00:34:13.449
MATT: Silly grapple. Okay.

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:16.528
TRAVIS: Don't move. He can't see us if we don't
move.

00:34:16.528 --> 00:34:23.868
MATT: Even with disadvantage, that is an athletics
check of 25. I need you to make an athletics check.

00:34:23.868 --> 00:34:26.637
MARISHA and LAURA: Come on, Grog.

00:34:26.637 --> 00:34:31.012
TRAVIS: Nope. 22.

00:34:31.012 --> 00:34:39.387
MATT: It bursts out of your grasp and takes up in
the air with its giant wings. You do get an attack

00:34:39.387 --> 00:34:43.322
of opportunity on it. As does Trinket, actually.

00:34:43.322 --> 00:34:49.438
TRAVIS: I'm going to make it a reckless attack,
Great Weapon Master.

00:34:49.438 --> 00:34:51.895
LAURA: Can you do that on a reaction?

00:34:51.895 --> 00:34:53.823
TRAVIS: On any of them.

00:34:53.823 --> 00:35:02.573
MARISHA: What, is he coming for me? That looks
like that's what's happening.

00:35:02.573 --> 00:35:04.121
LIAM: That's fucked up.

00:35:04.121 --> 00:35:07.877
TRAVIS: Where did he go? Oh.

00:35:07.877 --> 00:35:13.026
MATT: It (whoosh) in the air. It's actually going
to stay about--

00:35:13.026 --> 00:35:17.412
MARIHSA: It's coming for us.

00:35:17.412 --> 00:35:19.002
LAURA: Why?

00:35:19.002 --> 00:35:23.011
MARISHA: I tried to make him stupid and I'm sure
he realizes that.

00:35:23.011 --> 00:35:29.685
MATT: Let's say about 15 feet up about there.

00:35:29.685 --> 00:35:31.426
LAURA: Fuck.

00:35:31.426 --> 00:35:36.798
MATT: That's all he can do with his turn because
of the trying to break out of the grapple.

00:35:36.798 --> 00:35:38.782
LAURA: Do you have time to move?

00:35:38.782 --> 00:35:40.178
MATT: How much damage is that?

00:35:40.178 --> 00:35:41.444
TRAVIS: I didn't roll damage yet.

00:35:41.444 --> 00:35:42.658
MATT: Oh what was your roll to hit?

00:35:42.658 --> 00:35:44.470
TRAVIS: Great Weapon Master, reckless. I waited to
roll.

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:46.115
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

00:35:46.115 --> 00:35:50.795
TRAVIS: That's better. 32 minus five is--

00:35:50.795 --> 00:35:54.688
MATT: 27. That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

00:35:54.688 --> 00:35:56.096
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:35:56.096 --> 00:36:03.067
LAURA: Trinket rolled 21.

00:36:03.067 --> 00:36:05.439
MATT: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll.

00:36:05.439 --> 00:36:07.530
LAURA: Is that a bite?

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:10.386
TRAVIS: 36 with the Great Weapon Master.

00:36:10.386 --> 00:36:14.717
LAURA: Is it a bite attack or claw attack? Do I
get to choose?

00:36:14.717 --> 00:36:16.244
MATT: I'll let you choose.

00:36:16.244 --> 00:36:19.920
LAURA: It's a bite attack.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.480
TRAVIS: His carefree manner worries me.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.834
LAURA: It's 13.

00:36:26.834 --> 00:36:33.419
MATT: 13. All right. Trinket as he bites upward,
it doesn't do anywhere near the impact you think

00:36:33.419 --> 00:36:36.993
it would even for a nice solid bite. It seems to
be resistant to Trinket's damage.

00:36:36.993 --> 00:36:42.222
LAURA: To piercing damage? To bear damage?

00:36:42.222 --> 00:36:44.797
MATT: Half damage from bears.

00:36:44.797 --> 00:36:46.774
TRAVIS: Was he resistant to my slashing damage?

00:36:46.774 --> 00:36:47.833
MATT: No.

00:36:47.833 --> 00:36:49.767
LAURA: What? It must be piercing.

00:36:49.767 --> 00:36:52.198
TRAVIS: I do have a magic weapon.

00:36:52.198 --> 00:36:57.406
MATT: That ends Ghurrix's turn. All right, that
brings us now to the erinyes. The erinyes is going

00:36:57.406 --> 00:37:00.008
to attempt to escape.

00:37:00.008 --> 00:37:02.343
MARIHSA: Strength saving throw, bitch.

00:37:02.343 --> 00:37:28.432
MATT: That's a 17 plus four. That's 21. Breaks
free of the sphere. Erinyes, which can go 60 feet

00:37:28.432 --> 00:37:46.451
up, is going to fly up onto the rooftop there.
Your sphere is left there on the ground. However,

00:37:46.451 --> 00:37:58.322
wasted the action to try and break through. All right.
That ends their turns. The two celestial boys try

00:37:58.322 --> 00:38:01.045
and pull against the chains. Do you let go or do
you hold them there?

00:38:01.045 --> 00:38:02.443
SAM: I let go.

00:38:02.443 --> 00:38:05.240
MATT: Okay. They both run this way.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.278
LAURA: No. I meant in the mansion!

00:38:07.278 --> 00:38:10.249
MATT: Do you yell this as they 
start to run way?

00:38:10.249 --> 00:38:13.866
LAURA: I said yes. I meant in the mansion,
stupid.

00:38:13.866 --> 00:38:17.665
MATT: Okay. They don't really know what the heck
is going on. I'm going to roll to see if they

00:38:17.665 --> 00:38:23.881
recognize that in the panic. Okay. Both roll tens.
They both hear you, stop, turn, and bolt into the

00:38:23.881 --> 00:38:25.069
mansion.

00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:26.298
LAURA: Yay!

00:38:26.298 --> 00:38:28.016
SAM: I don't let them in.

00:38:28.016 --> 00:38:32.694
MATT: What a dick. What a dick move. All right,
Scanlan, you're up.

00:38:32.694 --> 00:38:36.983
LIAM: You get two hit points. Temporary hit points.

00:38:36.983 --> 00:38:41.660
SAM: I'm doing better. I'm doing better than I was
before this fight started.

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:46.979
LIAM: Oh my gosh, I get to hit a hundred hit points
because of that spell. That's amazing.

00:38:46.979 --> 00:38:50.006
SAM: How high up is the pit fiend?

00:38:50.006 --> 00:38:52.926
MATT: 15 feet up off the ground, currently.

00:38:52.926 --> 00:38:56.314
SAM: And how far away am I from him?

00:38:56.314 --> 00:39:05.142
MATT: You are currently... about 55 feet.

00:39:05.142 --> 00:39:06.812
SAM: Oh shit.

00:39:06.812 --> 00:39:08.538
MATT: 50 to 55 feet.

00:39:08.538 --> 00:39:10.162
SAM: Can't even get close enough to do shit.

00:39:10.162 --> 00:39:12.048
MATT: You can move.

00:39:12.048 --> 00:39:18.877
SAM: I can move, but my move is nothing. It's 25.

00:39:18.877 --> 00:39:22.695
MATT: Just so you know. Vax, you didn't get
temporary hit points.

00:39:22.695 --> 00:39:25.498
LIAM: At the start of my next turn I do though,
don't I?

00:39:25.498 --> 00:39:27.049
MATT: Did you cast it on yourself or on Scanlan?

00:39:27.049 --> 00:39:30.116
LIAM: Both of us. Action, action, and the bonus
action was an attack. Hasted.

00:39:30.116 --> 00:39:32.389
MATT: You can't have two concentration spells up
at the same time.

00:39:32.389 --> 00:39:33.620
LIAM: Oh, it's a concentration spell?

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:34.850
MATT: Yes, it is.

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:38.895
LIAM: I'll leave it on Scanlan. Can I take a
secondary hit on him after the fact, since I was

00:39:38.895 --> 00:39:41.501
unaware of the rules?

00:39:41.501 --> 00:39:46.832
MATT: Sure. Because you're not used to casting
spells. Sure. I'll let you.

00:39:46.832 --> 00:39:52.590
MARISHA: Technically, I thought you couldn't
cast-- I thought it doesn't work with spells. I

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.223
don't know.

00:39:54.223 --> 00:39:55.468
SAM and MATT: What?

00:39:55.468 --> 00:40:00.405
MARISHA: Thought you couldn't just cast two spells.
It was only melee attacks--

00:40:00.405 --> 00:40:03.108
LIAM: Right. Which is what he's saying.

00:40:03.108 --> 00:40:09.259
MATT: One of them is concentration. Because it's
an action spell. One action from your haste spell

00:40:09.259 --> 00:40:10.722
can only be used for a weapon attack.

00:40:10.722 --> 00:40:14.450
LIAM: Right. And we had a text conversation
earlier today where I said that if I don't hold an

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:17.125
action, I can do this, this, and this, and we just
misunderstood each other.

00:40:17.125 --> 00:40:20.101
MATT: Probably. That's totally fine. Sorry, I
misunderstood earlier and thought you were

00:40:20.101 --> 00:40:22.714
just casting it on Scanlan. No worries.

00:40:22.714 --> 00:40:26.330
LIAM: So keep the one on Scanlan, and I'm going to
roll. I would have rolled a secondary shitty

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:28.396
attack on him for 22.

00:40:28.396 --> 00:40:29.753
MATT: Okay, that hits.

00:40:29.753 --> 00:40:35.540
LIAM: Okay. That is a massive nine hit points of
damage.

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:46.186
MATT: Boom. All righty. Great. So now it is Pike's
turn.

00:40:46.186 --> 00:40:48.658
SAM: I haven't gone yet.

00:40:48.658 --> 00:40:50.110
MATT: Oh, that's right.

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:56.208
SAM: Okay, I am too far away to do anything and
don't really want to get in closer. I will get a

00:40:56.208 --> 00:40:59.695
little bit closer so I am in range to inspire
Keyleth.

00:40:59.695 --> 00:41:02.085
MARISHA: Aw, thanks, man.

00:41:02.085 --> 00:41:08.217
SAM: And I will inspire her with a randomly
selected limerick from this disgusting book that

00:41:08.217 --> 00:41:09.486
Taliesin gave me.

00:41:09.486 --> 00:41:10.885
TALIESIN: Oh, throw it at me. Okay.

00:41:10.885 --> 00:41:13.791
SAM: Okay.

00:41:13.791 --> 00:41:15.303
TALIESIN: Pick carefully.

00:41:15.303 --> 00:41:17.173
SAM: They're all horrible.

00:41:17.173 --> 00:41:18.628
TALIESIN: They are. Pick carefully.

00:41:18.628 --> 00:41:25.545
SAM: Okay, ready? Nope, that's disgusting. Wow.
Okay. Sure.

00:41:25.545 --> 00:41:29.130
Maggie is such a sad sack of shit

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:32.283
That no one will tickle her tit.

00:41:32.283 --> 00:41:34.311
It would make her so glad

00:41:34.311 --> 00:41:35.765
To be had by a lad.

00:41:35.765 --> 00:41:38.396
Her drawers cream at the thought of it?

00:41:38.396 --> 00:41:42.092
Taliesin, what did you give me?!

00:41:42.092 --> 00:41:44.094
TALIESIN: The only thing I knew you'd love.

00:41:44.094 --> 00:41:47.221
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

00:41:47.221 --> 00:41:50.716
MATT: Keyleth, do you want to take an inspiration
dice?

00:41:50.716 --> 00:41:53.297
TRAVIS: It's like the Restricted Section of
Hogwarts.

00:41:53.297 --> 00:41:55.417
MARISHA: I wouldn't understand half of those
references.

00:41:55.417 --> 00:41:57.074
LIAM: It's very in character.

00:41:57.074 --> 00:42:01.924
MATT: Keyleth would be like, "I like whipped
cream."

00:42:01.924 --> 00:42:04.090
MARISHA: I love whipped cream. It's delicious.

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:09.157
MATT: There you go. So take your inspiration dice
in misunderstanding Scanlan's extremely gross

00:42:09.157 --> 00:42:10.169
limerick.

00:42:10.169 --> 00:42:13.000
TALIESIN: Don't you dare pin that on me. Don't you
fucking dare.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.844
MATT: That's your bonus action. That's your
movement. What do you want for your action?

00:42:15.844 --> 00:42:18.210
LIAM: This is why we play the game.

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:22.332
TALIESIN: That was definitely a nice one that you
found. They get way worse.

00:42:22.332 --> 00:42:25.287
TRAVIS: That was amazing.

00:42:25.287 --> 00:42:34.340
SAM: I will cast Bigby's Hand! And make it an
Interposing Hand between Keyleth and the pit fiend.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:37.476
MARISHA: Thanks, Scanlan.

00:42:37.476 --> 00:42:39.267
MATT: All righty.

00:42:39.267 --> 00:42:41.056
SAM: So now he'll just attack me instead.

00:42:41.056 --> 00:42:52.379
MATT: Interposing Hand. You have half cover,
Keyleth, as Bigby's Hand is essentially giving you

00:42:52.379 --> 00:42:57.345
some sort of armor bonus.

00:42:57.345 --> 00:43:02.393
SAM: Does it stop him from moving towards her? Is
that how it happens?

00:43:02.393 --> 00:43:04.570
MATT: It gives her half cover.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:05.929
SAM: It's like a wall.

00:43:05.929 --> 00:43:08.587
MATT: Target can't move through the hand's space
if its strength score is less than or equal to the

00:43:08.587 --> 00:43:09.454
hand's strength score.

00:43:09.454 --> 00:43:11.171
SAM: Oh shit. It's probably super strong.

00:43:11.171 --> 00:43:14.557
MATT: The hand's strength score is 26. It is
equal.

00:43:14.557 --> 00:43:16.954
SAM: So what does that mean? It's a roll?

00:43:16.954 --> 00:43:18.684
MATT: So it can move through the hand.

00:43:18.684 --> 00:43:21.002
SAM: Shit! Well, that didn't do much.

00:43:21.002 --> 00:43:27.673
MATT: Hold on. Oh, it's less or equal to. So no, it
cannot move through the hand. Sorry. I misread it.

00:43:27.673 --> 00:43:31.199
Currently, if it tries to force its way through 
the hand, it's going to hold it in place.

00:43:31.199 --> 00:43:33.994
MARISHA: Talk to the hand.

00:43:33.994 --> 00:43:35.145
SAM: Yes.

00:43:35.145 --> 00:43:38.930
MATT: There we go. All right. So that finishes
your turn? All right. Now it's Pike's turn.

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:42.586
LAURA: Oh. Okay. I'm controlling Pike right now.

00:43:42.586 --> 00:43:45.478
MATT: Yes, you are. For the time being. Pike is
inside the mansion right now. She watched

00:43:45.478 --> 00:43:51.368
Percy step into the door frame, fire a few shots
out, and then duck right behind it again.

00:43:51.368 --> 00:43:54.166
LAURA: Okay. So she's looking through the door.
What can she see?

00:43:54.166 --> 00:43:59.460
MATT: Right now all she sees is Grog and Trinket
were attacking the pit fiend as it flew off, and

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:02.298
that's all she sees now is Grog and Trinket by
themselves outside on the street.

00:44:02.298 --> 00:44:03.526
LAURA: Okay.

00:44:03.526 --> 00:44:06.144
MATT: And this watery sphere that's floating in
space.

00:44:06.144 --> 00:44:14.535
LAURA: Okay, she's going to step out of the door,
and she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon.

00:44:14.535 --> 00:44:16.593
MATT: Okay, where is she going to cast it?

00:44:16.593 --> 00:44:27.353
LAURA: At fourth level. If she makes it an anvil, can
she knock him down to the ground?

00:44:27.353 --> 00:44:30.764
MATT: (laughs) That's more of a flavor element.

00:44:30.764 --> 00:44:37.079
LAURA: I want to make it barbed noose to go around
his neck.

00:44:37.079 --> 00:44:44.784
MATT: Okay. In true Sarenrae fashion. All right.
So for the purposes of that we will say that this

00:44:44.784 --> 00:44:46.975
glowing yellow--

00:44:46.975 --> 00:44:50.680
LAURA: It's a yellow noose, so it looks
spiritual.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:57.084
MATT: All righty. So we'll say that it's in the
same space as him where you conjure it. There. At

00:44:57.084 --> 00:45:07.337
a fourth level. So at fourth level, that means its
attacks do 4d8 plus five per hit. If it hits. Now

00:45:07.337 --> 00:45:13.320
that it's landed, so you cast a spell, it makes a
melee attack. So go ahead and roll a d20, adding

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.573
ten to that.

00:45:14.573 --> 00:45:15.773
LAURA: 23?

00:45:15.773 --> 00:45:18.678
MATT: That hits, so go ahead and roll 4d8 plus
five.

00:45:18.678 --> 00:45:27.391
LAURA: 26 points. And is that all the bonus?

00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:29.058
MATT: That's all the bonus action.

00:45:29.058 --> 00:45:30.214
LAURA: Okay, cool.

00:45:30.214 --> 00:45:33.459
MATT: She cannot cast any other spell, unless it's
second level or lower.

00:45:33.459 --> 00:45:38.289
LAURA: Oh, okay. Is Beacon of Hope-- oh, it's
third level. Shit balls.

00:45:38.289 --> 00:45:40.821
SAM: Can you please do this as Ashley, please?

00:45:40.821 --> 00:45:47.446
LAURA: "Oh, okay! Oh, hold on!"

00:45:47.446 --> 00:45:50.814
TALIESIN: That's actually really good.

00:45:50.814 --> 00:46:02.836
MATT: Things that are helpful: Aid. Let's see,
there is Prayer of Healing.

00:46:02.836 --> 00:46:07.031
LAURA: Okay, but nobody's hurt just yet. Spell
bolsters allies with toughness and resolve.

00:46:07.031 --> 00:46:12.035
MARISHA: Doesn't she have an evil thing? An
anti-evil-people-thing? No?

00:46:12.035 --> 00:46:13.728
TRAVIS: Anti-evil-people.

00:46:13.728 --> 00:46:21.528
MATT: Let us all cross our fingers that Blindspot
finishes that thing they're shooting soon and she

00:46:21.528 --> 00:46:22.876
comes back to us.

00:46:22.876 --> 00:46:27.265
SAM: She just texted!

00:46:27.265 --> 00:46:29.104
LAURA: Oh, did she? What did she say?

00:46:29.104 --> 00:46:33.043
SAM: She said, "I have a power that kills all evil
people around me."

00:46:33.043 --> 00:46:35.279
LAURA: Oh, good! I want to do that!

00:46:35.279 --> 00:46:37.085
MATT: That's not how that works.

00:46:37.085 --> 00:46:39.444
MARISHA: But there's a radius blast thing.

00:46:39.444 --> 00:46:41.568
LAURA: Radius blast, but that's not a second level or
lower.

00:46:41.568 --> 00:46:46.453
MATT: You know what, we'll say for the purposes of
this, if you want to cast Aid on somebody,

00:46:46.453 --> 00:46:49.131
otherwise, right now, you'll have to miss the
turn. Because we have to keep this going.

00:46:49.131 --> 00:46:53.641
LAURA: Oh god, okay, fine! I'll do Aid, I guess.
Why not?

00:46:53.641 --> 00:47:00.497
MATT: Okay. Up to three creatures within 30 feet.
Their maximum hit points increase by five.

00:47:00.497 --> 00:47:07.530
LAURA: Okay, that's going to be huge. So the only
people that are in range are Trinket, Grog, and me.

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:09.254
MATT: And Scanlan, technically.

00:47:09.254 --> 00:47:11.043
TALIESIN: And, technically, me.

00:47:11.043 --> 00:47:14.772
MATT: Grog, Pike, and Scanlan would all work if
you wanted to do that.

00:47:14.772 --> 00:47:21.606
LAURA: So Grog, Pike, and Scanlan. You don't need
it, though. Do you need it? I'm going to go

00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:22.681
Trinket--

00:47:22.681 --> 00:47:26.393
MATT: Or you could do Channel Divinity, if you
prefer that. No, it hasn't been seven days, so she

00:47:26.393 --> 00:47:30.268
can't do it yet. Since the Vorugal battle.

00:47:30.268 --> 00:47:32.600
LAURA: Okay, Trinket, Scanlan, and Pike.

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:36.669
MATT: Trinket, Scanlan, and Pike. So that's five
additional hit points to Trinket's maximum, to

00:47:36.669 --> 00:47:38.709
Scanlan's maximum, and to Pike's.

00:47:38.709 --> 00:47:40.691
LAURA: And then Pike's going to run back in the
door.

00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:45.753
MATT: Okay, and then Pike darts back in. There you
go. All right, that ends the first round of

00:47:45.753 --> 00:47:52.789
combat. Next round, I'll actually be able to do
some things. Vex, you're up. At the top of your

00:47:52.789 --> 00:48:03.467
turn, as you glance up, you can see (whooshing)
this hellish devil creature. Its presence itself

00:48:03.467 --> 00:48:06.953
quakes you to the core. I need you to roll a
wisdom saving throw.

00:48:06.953 --> 00:48:17.001
LAURA: Okay. Oh, okay! Plus five, what is that?
23.

00:48:17.001 --> 00:48:23.009
MATT: 23, okay. You manage to resist the
creature's fearful aura.

00:48:23.009 --> 00:48:24.310
LAURA: Thank god!

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:25.868
TRAVIS: Holy shit, aura?

00:48:25.868 --> 00:48:27.961
MATT: Yeah. You may take the rest of your turn.

00:48:27.961 --> 00:48:34.218
LAURA: Okay, good! Okay, I've already tried the
Bramble Shot. It's gone now. Then I'm going to

00:48:34.218 --> 00:48:42.495
attack him a couple times. That was a one and a
30.

00:48:42.495 --> 00:48:44.657
MATT: 30 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on that.

00:48:44.657 --> 00:48:46.165
LIAM: Man, your jail is full tonight.

00:48:46.165 --> 00:49:02.413
LAURA: The jail is full! I'm out of dice. I have
to go through my bag again. 21. And then I'm going

00:49:02.413 --> 00:49:13.563
to move into the mansion. No! Yes, I'm going to
move into the mansion. No! Okay. Yeah, I'm going

00:49:13.563 --> 00:49:17.265
to move into the mansion. What? He's whispering at
me.

00:49:17.265 --> 00:49:22.857
MATT: You vanish inside the mansion. All righty!

00:49:22.857 --> 00:49:29.876
LAURA: Trinket licks Grog.

00:49:29.876 --> 00:49:34.219
TRAVIS: Not now! Aw, there's always time for
lick.

00:49:34.219 --> 00:49:43.586
MATT: All right, that ends your turn? Keyleth. Top
of your turn, even with the Hand there, the

00:49:43.586 --> 00:49:47.856
creature's size is so large and voluminous by
comparison to it, and you see it's still trained

00:49:47.856 --> 00:49:50.041
on you. I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

00:49:50.041 --> 00:49:58.975
MARISHA: (whimpering) Okay. Oh, that's not bad.
21.

00:49:58.975 --> 00:50:08.079
MATT: 21? Just succeeds. You guys are rolling real
well tonight. It's frustrating me.

00:50:08.079 --> 00:50:10.617
TALIESIN: Don't make that face!

00:50:10.617 --> 00:50:12.417
TRAVIS: More than the beholder fight?

00:50:12.417 --> 00:50:19.299
MATT: It's on par. But we've only just begun.
Continue. What are you doing, Keyleth?

00:50:19.299 --> 00:50:25.586
MARISHA: Oh my god. Okay. My water sphere is still
over there?

00:50:25.586 --> 00:50:27.601
MATT: Your water sphere is still over there.

00:50:27.601 --> 00:50:33.385
MARISHA: Well, shit. I'm going to drop the watery
sphere.

00:50:33.385 --> 00:50:36.170
MATT: All right. Splashes into the ground.

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:43.479
MARISHA: I'm going to try and Earthbind this
motherfucker.

00:50:43.479 --> 00:50:45.084
MATT: All righty.

00:50:45.084 --> 00:50:46.272
SAM: The fiend?

00:50:46.272 --> 00:50:49.405
MARISHA: Yep. Try and get him down.

00:50:49.405 --> 00:50:58.820
MATT: Earthbind, there. That is a strength saving
throw against your DC.

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:00.925
TALIESIN: Check, or saving throw?

00:51:00.925 --> 00:51:08.603
MATT: Saving throw. That is a natural 20, so yeah.
No effect, unfortunately. The spell gets shrugged

00:51:08.603 --> 00:51:13.229
off. It looks like we have an Ashley.

00:51:13.229 --> 00:51:19.672
LAURA: Ashley, I'm texting you right now to tell
you what you did!

00:51:19.672 --> 00:51:24.040
ASHLEY: Okay!

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.460
SAM: She's still in set makeup!

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:28.246
LIAM: She's got professional makeup for our game!

00:51:28.246 --> 00:51:30.031
LAURA: You look so pretty!

00:51:30.031 --> 00:51:31.438
MATT: Keyleth.

00:51:31.438 --> 00:51:48.286
MARISHA: Fuck, that's it. He blew my action. Can I
try and back away from his crazy presence? I can't

00:51:48.286 --> 00:51:50.113
see exactly where I am.

00:51:50.113 --> 00:51:53.551
MATT: Yeah, you can back away if you want to.
You're right behind here.

00:51:53.551 --> 00:51:57.894
MARISHA: Is there a way I can tuck inside the
little tower that's right there?

00:51:57.894 --> 00:52:01.637
MATT: You see no entrance to the tower, but you
can tuck into this little alcove there, if you want.

00:52:01.637 --> 00:52:02.852
MARISHA: Sure.

00:52:02.852 --> 00:52:05.642
LAURA: Just come back the other way! Come back
toward us!

00:52:05.642 --> 00:52:07.145
MARISHA: Can I move toward them?

00:52:07.145 --> 00:52:09.870
MATT: This way? If you want to.

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:12.408
MARISHA: And tuck into this alcove, maybe?

00:52:12.408 --> 00:52:14.124
MATT: If you move around--

00:52:14.124 --> 00:52:15.763
MARISHA: If I move under him?

00:52:15.763 --> 00:52:17.627
TALIESIN: He's high enough up. In theory, he can't
reach.

00:52:17.627 --> 00:52:19.054
MATT: Well, he's 15 feet above you.

00:52:19.054 --> 00:52:21.125
MARISHA: He's only 15 feet?

00:52:21.125 --> 00:52:22.283
MATT: Yeah.

00:52:22.283 --> 00:52:26.091
MARISHA: Okay, hang on. He's only 15 feet.

00:52:26.091 --> 00:52:30.687
MATT: He's a bigger creature. Moving beneath him,
there's a possibility he may be able to hit you

00:52:30.687 --> 00:52:32.607
with something if you move past him.

00:52:32.607 --> 00:52:34.383
SAM: Maybe, but maybe not.

00:52:34.383 --> 00:52:35.898
LIAM: Underneath, not within five feet?

00:52:35.898 --> 00:52:38.673
LAURA: It's different. He's big! He could have a
whip!

00:52:38.673 --> 00:52:44.204
MARISHA: Okay, can I try something?

00:52:44.204 --> 00:52:45.681
MATT: Sure.

00:52:45.681 --> 00:53:00.624
MARISHA: He's hovering above this? Can I, as a
bonus action, cast Grasping Vine? Right over here?

00:53:00.624 --> 00:53:02.401
MATT: Over there?

00:53:02.401 --> 00:53:05.248
MARISHA: No, sorry. Over here.

00:53:05.248 --> 00:53:11.930
TALIESIN: He can't see it. Against the south wall
of that little building.

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:16.319
MARISHA: And I want to try and Grasping Vine and
drag his ass into the lava.

00:53:16.319 --> 00:53:20.924
MATT: Into the lava? Okay, so there's a Grasping
Vine over here.

00:53:20.924 --> 00:53:22.324
MARISHA: Yeah, that works.

00:53:22.324 --> 00:53:34.439
MATT: All right. It lashes out toward it, 30 feet.
It has to make a dexterity saving throw. At a 26.

00:53:34.439 --> 00:53:35.565
MARISHA: Fuck.

00:53:35.565 --> 00:53:36.941
TRAVIS: He's rolling good, too!

00:53:36.941 --> 00:53:40.495
MATT: Yeah. The vine reaches out toward him and he
(whiplash) out of the way and it whips into the

00:53:40.495 --> 00:53:41.869
air and withdraws back.

00:53:41.869 --> 00:53:48.505
MARISHA: This isn't going well. All right,
whatever. I'm going to move around, still try and

00:53:48.505 --> 00:53:50.352
dodge him and tuck in this way.

00:53:50.352 --> 00:53:59.046
MATT: Tuck in there? Okay. As you rush underneath
him, heading down, he has a large mace in his

00:53:59.046 --> 00:54:05.686
hand. He sweeps down toward you as you go darting.
I'm going to actually roll a percentile dice to

00:54:05.686 --> 00:54:10.991
see if it manages to catch you, at your height,
because you're a little over five feet tall.

00:54:10.991 --> 00:54:12.518
SAM: She's in half cover.

00:54:12.518 --> 00:54:14.628
MARISHA: I do have Bigby's Hand.

00:54:14.628 --> 00:54:21.656
MATT: You do. The interposing hand is helping you
against ranged creatures. The cover doesn't

00:54:21.656 --> 00:54:24.042
really-- Well, let me check, just to be sure.

00:54:24.042 --> 00:54:28.120
LAURA: So many books tonight.

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:31.510
SAM: So many things, guys. Guys, Dungeons and
Dragons.

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:43.244
MATT: It does say 'opposite side of the cover'. So yeah, it's
a plus two to your AC.

00:54:43.244 --> 00:54:48.168
MARISHA: Of what? Plus two to my AC? Okay!

00:54:48.168 --> 00:54:58.542
MATT: As it charges underneath. It would catch you
as you run past. That is a 26 to hit.

00:54:58.542 --> 00:55:00.560
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:06.469
MATT: Okay. So as you go rushing underneath him,
scooting behind this wide arc, he swoops downward

00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:10.782
with the mace, and it clocks you in the side of
the head as a burst of flame comes bursting out

00:55:10.782 --> 00:55:16.229
from the side of it. As you continue to run, you
can already feel the blood pouring down the front

00:55:16.229 --> 00:55:18.297
of your face from the impact.

00:55:18.297 --> 00:55:23.578
LIAM: In the immortal words of Laura Bailey,
"Mother bitch!"

00:55:23.578 --> 00:55:40.020
MATT: 18 points of bludgeoning damage, plus 29
points of fire damage. To the head. (whack)

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.940
MARISHA: All right, that hurts.

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:47.513
MATT: The mace bursts into flame as soon as it
begins to arc toward her. As it hits her in the

00:55:47.513 --> 00:55:51.660
side, you watch her stumble into the side of the
alleyway, the blood pouring from her face. The

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:55.851
flames burn the edges of her hair. The mace is now
alight, angrily.

00:55:55.851 --> 00:55:57.840
MARISHA: My antlers &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; my hair!

00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:00.141
MATT: That end your turn, Keyleth?

00:56:00.141 --> 00:56:02.009
SAM: (singing) Her head is on fire!

00:56:02.009 --> 00:56:07.780
MATT: Keyleth, you're done? Vax, you're up.

00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:12.168
LIAM: Still, even though we established Grog
first? I'll go first.

00:56:12.168 --> 00:56:15.394
MATT: Actually, no, we'll let Grog go first since
you guys decided to do that. I'll switch you in

00:56:15.394 --> 00:56:17.508
the order here. Grog first.

00:56:17.508 --> 00:56:27.388
TRAVIS: Could I ask, the roof that is underneath
She-Devil Wonder Woman? How high would it be for

00:56:27.388 --> 00:56:31.928
Grog to jump using his amazing leaping things?

00:56:31.928 --> 00:56:33.057
LAURA: His boots?

00:56:33.057 --> 00:56:34.458
TRAVIS: Yeah. The boots.

00:56:34.458 --> 00:56:37.400
MATT: Well, what does it say on the boots?

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:45.152
TRAVIS: It is a bonus action to jump 15 feet.
Boots of Feral Leaping. DC of 15, 15 feet straight

00:56:45.152 --> 00:56:46.228
in the air.

00:56:46.228 --> 00:56:53.569
MATT: The roof is about where she is. She's about
25 feet up. You would be able to get up onto the

00:56:53.569 --> 00:56:58.276
roof and probably close enough to maybe get a
throwing attack on her.

00:56:58.276 --> 00:57:03.526
TRAVIS: Great. Could I try and run over to there,
jump up on the roof, and run right underneath her?

00:57:03.526 --> 00:57:05.975
MATT: You leap up.

00:57:05.975 --> 00:57:11.915
LAURA: I love these things. Right? They're so
fancy.

00:57:11.915 --> 00:57:15.482
TRAVIS: Also, can I attach the Chain of Returning
to the Bloodaxe?

00:57:15.482 --> 00:57:20.186
MATT: You might actually be able to do melee on
this, looking at where she is. She wasn't quite

00:57:20.186 --> 00:57:22.042
that high, so you could actually make a melee
attack.

00:57:22.042 --> 00:57:23.308
TRAVIS: Really?!

00:57:23.308 --> 00:57:26.355
MATT: I was looking at her stand for her height,
but that's just her--

00:57:26.355 --> 00:57:31.049
TRAVIS: Can I make both my attacks reckless, Great
Weapon Master attacks?

00:57:31.049 --> 00:57:32.633
MATT: You can, yes.

00:57:32.633 --> 00:57:44.389
TRAVIS: 17. That is probably going to hit. That is
a 30 on the first one. Nope, 25. Minus five. 25 on

00:57:44.389 --> 00:57:45.462
the first one.

00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:46.742
MATT: 25 hits.

00:57:46.742 --> 00:57:53.061
TRAVIS: Okay. And that's a 27, minus five. 22.

00:57:53.061 --> 00:57:54.281
MATT: Both hit.

00:57:54.281 --> 00:57:55.594
TRAVIS: Nice.

00:57:55.594 --> 00:58:00.016
MATT: This is going to be nasty. Actually, hold on.
Was it 22?

00:58:00.016 --> 00:58:01.945
TRAVIS: Yeah, 22 was the second one.

00:58:01.945 --> 00:58:05.080
MATT: Yeah, that's not going to matter. Okay, so
it still hits. Go for it.

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:19.783
TRAVIS: That's the wrong dice. 28 plus ten is 38
for the first one.

00:58:19.783 --> 00:58:21.149
MATT: All righty.

00:58:21.149 --> 00:58:29.844
TRAVIS: And the second one is (counting) 27. 37
for the second one.

00:58:29.844 --> 00:58:39.794
MATT: 37, whew. That's nasty. All righty, so two
heavy hits as you rush up, using the boots. You

00:58:39.794 --> 00:58:44.060
leap onto the rooftop, coming down with your
axe into two giant swings across the armored lady.

00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:47.633
Each hits her, and you see sparks fly and a bit of
blood begin to seep from some of the wounds.

00:58:47.633 --> 00:58:50.530
Definitely taking a nice little chunk out of her.

00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:53.663
TRAVIS: I want to ask her name, but I don't.

00:58:53.663 --> 00:58:58.567
MATT: Well, and you don't have time to really ask
because she hisses in your face.

00:58:58.567 --> 00:59:00.424
TRAVIS: I'm allergic to cats.

00:59:00.424 --> 00:59:05.341
MATT: All right, that end your turn? All right,
Vax now.

00:59:05.341 --> 00:59:07.658
LIAM: Is Grog within five feet now? Is he right up
against her?

00:59:07.658 --> 00:59:08.762
MATT: Correct.

00:59:08.762 --> 00:59:13.509
LIAM: Okay, so what I want to do, hasted, I can go
120 feet. So what I want to do is a tight arc

00:59:13.509 --> 00:59:19.574
around so that I can go this way and down into
that little corner so I can land behind Keyleth,

00:59:19.574 --> 00:59:24.331
but on the way I want to throw a dagger. Yeah, I
want to land right next to Keyleth, down in that

00:59:24.331 --> 00:59:27.109
little nook. But on the way, I want to throw
Whisper at her.

00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:31.188
MATT: Okay, go for it. As you arc around here--

00:59:31.188 --> 00:59:35.633
LIAM: Okay, advantage, so that is very good. 28.

00:59:35.633 --> 00:59:37.086
MATT: That hits.

00:59:37.086 --> 00:59:53.416
LIAM: So that is one plus eight is nine, plus the
sneak attack is (counting) 32, plus the psychic

00:59:53.416 --> 01:00:00.583
damage is 33, so that hits her as I go by. I want
to land right behind Keyleth.

01:00:00.583 --> 01:00:04.076
MATT: Okay. There's not enough space,
technically--

01:00:04.076 --> 01:00:08.280
LIAM: There's no room? Can I land right in front
of her? Okay, I land right in front of her, grab

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:14.328
her by the face, kiss her full on the mouth, and
cast Heroism through the kiss. Then I'll use my

01:00:14.328 --> 01:00:26.617
bonus action for movement and fly up to that roof,
straight out across the street from him. From the

01:00:26.617 --> 01:00:27.773
pit fiend.

01:00:27.773 --> 01:00:29.371
MATT: So you're going to go across the way from
here?

01:00:29.371 --> 01:00:32.530
LIAM: You're now immune to fear, and you get two
hit points per round.

01:00:32.530 --> 01:00:34.877
MATT: And, Scanlan, you are not. Your Heroism goes
away.

01:00:34.877 --> 01:00:36.467
LAURA: It's a concentration.

01:00:36.467 --> 01:00:38.786
LIAM: Still doing it.

01:00:38.786 --> 01:00:41.230
MATT: So which direction are you going?

01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:44.728
LIAM: To the tallest building across from the--

01:00:44.728 --> 01:00:46.041
MATT: Over here?

01:00:46.041 --> 01:00:48.043
LIAM: No. I don't have the thingie.

01:00:48.043 --> 01:00:49.362
TRAVIS: Laser pointer, Keyleth.

01:00:49.362 --> 01:00:51.599
MATT: That's why I bought you guys laser
pointers.

01:00:51.599 --> 01:01:00.028
LIAM: Sorry. This building right here. But in the
little gap right here, this little diagonal spot.

01:01:00.028 --> 01:01:03.337
MATT: All righty, so, we'll say for this, we'll
put you right there.

01:01:03.337 --> 01:01:04.897
TRAVIS: How great is that thing?

01:01:04.897 --> 01:01:06.263
MATT: Cool.

01:01:06.263 --> 01:01:09.795
LIAM: So that I'm like this, so just my little
head is peeking out.

01:01:09.795 --> 01:01:11.976
LAURA: Your little, itty-bitty head.

01:01:11.976 --> 01:01:13.424
LIAM: Three-quarters cover.

01:01:13.424 --> 01:01:17.542
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Percy.

01:01:17.542 --> 01:01:23.039
TALIESIN: Oh, boy. Okay. Okay, fine.

01:01:23.039 --> 01:01:30.036
SAM: He passes.

01:01:30.036 --> 01:01:38.172
TALIESIN: First thing I'm going to do is tell the
servants, get these children out of their chains.

01:01:38.172 --> 01:01:42.847
You, either hide or help. Don't care. Turning
around, out of the room.

01:01:42.847 --> 01:01:49.635
SAM: My servants start instinctually stroking you.
Touching your hair.

01:01:49.635 --> 01:01:53.737
TALIESIN: You're just doing this to touch my hair.
Lord.

01:01:53.737 --> 01:01:55.428
SAM: It's all they know.

01:01:55.428 --> 01:02:04.443
TALIESIN: So I'm going to come out of the door,
take a look around, see him, and I'm taking a shot at--

01:02:04.443 --> 01:02:07.409
MATT: Okay, so you step out of the doorway and
look around-- Because currently, if you just poke

01:02:07.409 --> 01:02:09.128
out, all you see is the street in front of you.

01:02:09.128 --> 01:02:10.537
TALIESIN: No, I'm curling around the door.

01:02:10.537 --> 01:02:14.332
MATT: So you have to step out of the door and look
around the side. Okay. So you step out of the

01:02:14.332 --> 01:02:17.253
doorway, look off to this side. You have a view of
him.

01:02:17.253 --> 01:02:26.013
TALIESIN: Yeah. I see him. I'm going to take a
shot to try and drop him. I'm going to do a wing shot.

01:02:26.013 --> 01:02:27.588
MATT: Okay.

01:02:27.588 --> 01:02:30.366
TALIESIN: Burning grit.

01:02:30.366 --> 01:02:33.496
SAM: Burning down the grit.

01:02:33.496 --> 01:02:37.780
TALIESIN: Normal shot. Natural 20.

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:40.293
MARISHA: Hey!

01:02:40.293 --> 01:02:42.153
TRAVIS: Golden snitch!

01:02:42.153 --> 01:02:44.856
MARISHA: That was the wing shot?

01:02:44.856 --> 01:02:47.332
TALIESIN: That was the wing shot. It doesn't
matter, it doesn't affect the wing shot.

01:02:47.332 --> 01:02:50.194
MATT: Yeah, it doesn't do damage, it just brings
him down.

01:02:50.194 --> 01:02:51.752
TALIESIN: Well, no, the shot still does damage.

01:02:51.752 --> 01:02:54.033
MATT: Oh, sorry, but yeah, so 20 does--

01:02:54.033 --> 01:02:56.663
TALIESIN: But he still has to do a strength saving
check.

01:02:56.663 --> 01:03:01.602
LAURA: Even on a crit? But it's at disadvantage
because of Hex.

01:03:01.602 --> 01:03:04.362
TALIESIN: No, that's a strength check.

01:03:04.362 --> 01:03:07.741
MATT: Ability checks versus saving throws. So he
rolls a 20. What's the DC?

01:03:07.741 --> 01:03:11.984
TALIESIN: I can't find the DC. Where did the DC
go?

01:03:11.984 --> 01:03:13.310
SAM: Just say, like, 50.

01:03:13.310 --> 01:03:21.042
TALIESIN: 50. No, it's not 50. I think the
difficulty, I can't find it, but I think it's 18.

01:03:21.042 --> 01:03:26.788
MATT: Okay, if you haven't updated it, that's your
own fault. All right, so it succeeds the save. It

01:03:26.788 --> 01:03:29.593
does not get reduced. But it does take double
damage, so go ahead and roll for that.

01:03:29.593 --> 01:03:53.119
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm sorry, I'm so confused. Here
they are. So, double damage. So that's 18, 22

01:03:53.119 --> 01:03:56.057
points of normal damage.

01:03:56.057 --> 01:03:57.596
MATT: Okay.

01:03:57.596 --> 01:04:00.247
SAM: Piercing?

01:04:00.247 --> 01:04:12.839
TALIESIN: Of piercing damage. Three points of
necrotic damage. Two points of psychic damage. I'm

01:04:12.839 --> 01:04:16.802
going to try another shot to bring him down, same
thing. Oh, actually, that's a natural, so I don't

01:04:16.802 --> 01:04:19.253
even burn any grit. I'm going to try and bring him
down again.

01:04:19.253 --> 01:04:20.942
MATT: Okay.

01:04:20.942 --> 01:04:23.598
TALIESIN: That's 25.

01:04:23.598 --> 01:04:28.771
MATT: 25 hits. That is a 26 on the strength save.

01:04:28.771 --> 01:04:35.247
TALIESIN: And that's not the right dice to roll,
hold on. Wow, I'm really out of it. Here we go.

01:04:35.247 --> 01:04:44.932
That's 14 piercing. Four psychic. Six necrotic.

01:04:44.932 --> 01:04:47.262
MATT: All right, cool.

01:04:47.262 --> 01:04:49.667
TALIESIN: 14, four, and six, altogether.

01:04:49.667 --> 01:04:51.655
MATT: 24 total. All righty.

01:04:51.655 --> 01:05:06.308
TALIESIN: Then, one more attempt to bring him down
to earth. Here we go. That's 21 to hit.

01:05:06.308 --> 01:05:14.517
MATT: 21 hits. (laughing) Rolled the same, 26.

01:05:14.517 --> 01:05:16.696
TALIESIN: Can you switch dice? That would be
cool.

01:05:16.696 --> 01:05:20.357
MATT: No, he's-- 18 plus eight, yeah.

01:05:20.357 --> 01:05:22.120
LIAM: Matt bought a platinum snitch.

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:25.765
MATT: I bought a dice to combat you, Percy!

01:05:25.765 --> 01:05:30.678
TALIESIN: Oh, that's awful. Nine points of normal
damage, three points of necrotic, three points of

01:05:30.678 --> 01:05:31.695
psychic.

01:05:31.695 --> 01:05:33.532
MATT: Okay. 15, got it. All right, cool!

01:05:33.532 --> 01:05:38.949
TALIESIN: And bonus round, I reload and I'm going
to finish running to the other side of the--

01:05:38.949 --> 01:05:42.360
MATT: Going this way? This way?

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:47.623
TALIESIN: Yeah. And just hiding against the wall
there. Not even-- just by the fruit. By the fruit

01:05:47.623 --> 01:05:50.705
cart. Next to the barrel of ugh.

01:05:50.705 --> 01:05:53.859
SAM: The explosive barrel that certainly won't
explode.

01:05:53.859 --> 01:05:57.163
TRAVIS: Yeah, clearly. The red barrel that says
TNT.

01:05:57.163 --> 01:06:03.602
MATT: There you go. Okay, that ends Percy's turn.
Next up is Ghurrix. Ghurrix, who currently the

01:06:03.602 --> 01:06:06.142
issue with the hand being a problem, it's
frustrating--

01:06:06.142 --> 01:06:08.690
(laughter)

01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:15.971
MATT: --watches this equally frustrating flying
dagger machine flying about. After approaching

01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:21.517
her, touching her, casting something on her, then
darting off to the side. (mumbling) Versus, he

01:06:21.517 --> 01:06:30.904
can't see right there, he's going that way, he's
going to leap into the air. And you watch as this

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:36.155
giant devil comes swooping in towards you, lands
on the edge of the rooftop, you hear the top crack

01:06:36.155 --> 01:06:41.409
and some of the nearby obsidian that marks the
side of the stone roof shatter and break as dust

01:06:41.409 --> 01:06:44.103
and pebbles begin to break off and tumble down the
sides of the roof.

01:06:44.103 --> 01:06:45.828
LIAM: Dustin fell off the roof?

01:06:45.828 --> 01:06:49.485
MATT: It's going to go ahead and make four attacks
on you.

01:06:49.485 --> 01:06:50.762
LIAM: Slightly nervous.

01:06:50.762 --> 01:06:52.755
MATT: Bite, claw, mace, and tail.

01:06:52.755 --> 01:06:56.677
SAM: Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.

01:06:56.677 --> 01:06:59.710
LIAM: I'll use Uncanny Dodge on the first one, I
guess.

01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:04.825
MATT: Okay, the first one is the claw, that is a
32.

01:07:04.825 --> 01:07:07.005
LIAM: Uncanny Dodge.

01:07:07.005 --> 01:07:17.450
MATT: All righty. So that is 13 points of slashing
damage with the claw.

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.023
LIAM: That's what's halved?

01:07:19.023 --> 01:07:26.448
MATT: So half of that would be six. The bite
attack against you. That is--

01:07:26.448 --> 01:07:28.818
SAM: I'm going to use Cutting Words on that one.

01:07:28.818 --> 01:07:29.972
MATT: Okay.

01:07:29.972 --> 01:07:31.649
SAM: I'm going to try to distract.

01:07:31.649 --> 01:07:38.244
MATT: So 26 to hit. What's the range on that? 60
feet, right? Yeah, so that's fine. 26 to hit?

01:07:38.244 --> 01:07:39.513
LIAM: 26 hits.

01:07:39.513 --> 01:07:44.841
SAM: I'm going to yell up at the thing, we never
decided where you would send the check for those

01:07:44.841 --> 01:07:57.422
boys! My address is 1 Greyskull Keep, Emon, 90210,
courtesy of François Bertrand Jean-Luc Australia!

01:07:57.422 --> 01:08:04.960
But you should really forward it to Percival von
Fredrickstein von Musel de Rolo!

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:08.947
MATT: Go ahead and roll your d12.

01:08:08.947 --> 01:08:12.788
LIAM: Good, you just need it to go down four
points.

01:08:12.788 --> 01:08:14.233
SAM: 12 points.

01:08:14.233 --> 01:08:16.153
MATT: That'll do it!

01:08:16.153 --> 01:08:18.027
TRAVIS: Where was that shit during the card game?

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:21.339
(laughter)

01:08:21.339 --> 01:08:26.898
MATT: So frustrating. Okay. So, as he goes in to
bite, you duck out of the way and it's going to

01:08:26.898 --> 01:08:32.588
grasp for your throat, however the shouting
Scanlan causes his eyes to dart to the side and it

01:08:32.588 --> 01:08:33.772
just misses by an inch.

01:08:33.772 --> 01:08:35.309
LIAM: Love that little man!

01:08:35.309 --> 01:08:40.075
MATT: It's going to go for its tail attack now.
That is a natural 20.

01:08:40.075 --> 01:08:43.587
LIAM: I'd like to use my first Luck on him, so he
has to roll again.

01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:47.068
MATT: All right. Natural 20!

01:08:47.068 --> 01:08:48.394
(groans)

01:08:48.394 --> 01:08:50.372
MATT: I'm not even joking, you can come look if
you want!

01:08:50.372 --> 01:08:52.205
LIAM: Go fuck yourself!

01:08:52.205 --> 01:08:57.578
MATT: I'm not even joking! I'm going to take a
picture, 'cause that's fun. That's fun.

01:08:57.578 --> 01:09:01.232
LIAM: It's fine, I'll die and roll another
character, it's fine!

01:09:01.232 --> 01:09:02.971
TRAVIS: Wow, two in row! Was that the studded
guy?

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:05.237
MATT: Oh yeah! That's the one I use for my big
actions.

01:09:05.237 --> 01:09:10.639
LAURA: Oh no! His figure just died!

01:09:10.639 --> 01:09:11.283
MATT: Oh no!

01:09:11.283 --> 01:09:12.923
SAM: Vax just died.

01:09:12.923 --> 01:09:16.869
MATT: This is where it starts. Hey. That was the
tail, right?

01:09:16.869 --> 01:09:18.072
LIAM: Yeah.

01:09:18.072 --> 01:09:19.903
MATT: So that's 3d10...

01:09:19.903 --> 01:09:21.563
LIAM: Wow, two 20s.

01:09:21.563 --> 01:09:24.678
MATT: That was amazing. I kind of wish I was using
that on the mace, but that's fine.

01:09:24.678 --> 01:09:27.632
LIAM: Avenge me!

01:09:27.632 --> 01:09:32.835
LAURA: If you fall unconscious, try to fall
unconscious the &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; direction, okay?

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:37.927
LIAM: Fall down on the mocap mattress!

01:09:37.927 --> 01:09:40.248
MATT: That's 46 points of bludgeoning damage.

01:09:40.248 --> 01:09:46.817
LIAM: 4d6 or 46? 46, great.

01:09:46.817 --> 01:09:49.117
MATT: Sorry, 44. Take that back, sorry, 44.

01:09:49.117 --> 01:09:50.630
LIAM: Well, that's much different.

01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:53.482
MATT: There you go. 44 points of bludgeoning
damage.

01:09:53.482 --> 01:09:58.276
MATT: As the tail (whack) slams into you as it
spins around, and as the tail hits you it already

01:09:58.276 --> 01:10:03.562
has its mace, the flames curling off of it,
swinging in a backhand motion, toward you. That's

01:10:03.562 --> 01:10:07.434
going to be a 22.

01:10:07.434 --> 01:10:08.704
LIAM: Doesn't hit!

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:10.002
MATT: Doesn't hit?

01:10:10.002 --> 01:10:14.240
LIAM: Doesn't hit, because I just got knocked
down, so it went over my fucking prone body!

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:23.446
MATT: Okay, so that ends its turn at the moment.

01:10:23.446 --> 01:10:26.865
LIAM: Everyone hears (groaning).

01:10:26.865 --> 01:10:29.589
MATT: And you know what? Actually--

01:10:29.589 --> 01:10:34.280
LIAM: Does he leave a Cleveland Steamer on me as
well?

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:37.225
LAURA: He's still got movement left.

01:10:37.225 --> 01:10:50.708
MATT: It's going to go ahead and fly down a bit.
Behind there.

01:10:50.708 --> 01:10:53.935
LAURA: (gasps) Ooh, what a dick!

01:10:53.935 --> 01:10:56.775
MARISHA: What's he doing? Is he hovering over the
lava?

01:10:56.775 --> 01:10:58.633
MATT: You do get an attack of opportunity if you'd
like.

01:10:58.633 --> 01:11:01.842
LIAM: Oh, sneak attack? No sneak attack. Okay,
fine. (wheezing) Ouch!

01:11:01.842 --> 01:11:03.843
MATT: Yeah, just reaching over toward it.

01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:08.110
LIAM: Ah, no, probably not. No. 16.

01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:26.864
MATT: 16? No. Now, the erinyes, which is up
against you, Grog, let's see. Yep! It's going to

01:11:26.864 --> 01:11:31.461
go ahead and first reach off to the side and take
its rope that it has. Throws it out in your

01:11:31.461 --> 01:11:36.105
direction. The rope suddenly sparks to life like a
magical snake and begins wrapping around your body

01:11:36.105 --> 01:11:37.156
rapidly.

01:11:37.156 --> 01:11:38.750
TRAVIS: Not nice.

01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:44.643
MATT: All right, go ahead and make either a
strength or dexterity check.

01:11:44.643 --> 01:11:55.833
TRAVIS: I have advantage on both. No, strength.
Natural 20.

01:11:55.833 --> 01:11:58.104
MATT: No effect.

01:11:58.104 --> 01:12:03.043
TRAVIS: I did not do that in a gloating way,
because I feel like that was very lucky.

01:12:03.043 --> 01:12:09.783
MATT: The rope that tries to wrap around you
bursts off and whips back to the side. The erinyes

01:12:09.783 --> 01:12:17.258
is now going to attempt to fly back and away from
you, which is going to offer you an attack of

01:12:17.258 --> 01:12:18.451
opportunity, Grog.

01:12:18.451 --> 01:12:33.297
TRAVIS: Oh, yes. Reckless and Great Weapon Master,
please. That's two natural ones in a row. My yin

01:12:33.297 --> 01:12:35.711
to your yang, sir. Jesus.

01:12:35.711 --> 01:12:41.739
LAURA: You want to put that in my jail?

01:12:41.739 --> 01:12:44.598
TRAVIS: No, I don't subscribe to that voodoo
bullshit.

01:12:44.598 --> 01:12:53.383
MATT: It's going to pull its bow out, its longbow,
while it's up in the air, pull back and loose an

01:12:53.383 --> 01:12:59.682
arrow against you, Grog. That is 21.

01:12:59.682 --> 01:13:00.880
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:21.845
MATT: Yes. All righty. So you take seven points of
piercing damage, halved. Plus 14 points of poison

01:13:21.845 --> 01:13:26.856
damage, which is not halved. I need you to make a
constitution saving throw.

01:13:26.856 --> 01:13:31.936
TRAVIS: Wait, I have resistance to poison because
of the Belt of Dwarvenkind.

01:13:31.936 --> 01:13:36.946
MATT: You do, so you take half that, actually, so
you take seven points of poison damage. You still

01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:40.191
need to make a constitution saving throw.

01:13:40.191 --> 01:13:44.775
TRAVIS: Okay. 21.

01:13:44.775 --> 01:13:48.737
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. You resist the poison
effect as it pulses through your system. All

01:13:48.737 --> 01:13:59.828
right. It still has a little more movement, so
it's going to go ahead and dart over.

01:13:59.828 --> 01:14:03.169
TRAVIS: She's got poisonous arrows!

01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:04.820
LAURA: Poisonless?

01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:07.358
TRAVIS: Yeah, how do you say it?

01:14:07.358 --> 01:14:11.392
LAURA: God, is she flying really far away?

01:14:11.392 --> 01:14:16.996
TRAVIS: She's fleeing! I don't blame you!

01:14:16.996 --> 01:14:24.851
MATT: We'll say she darts down and vanishes behind
this, there. All righty. That brings us to

01:14:24.851 --> 01:14:29.035
Scanlan.

01:14:29.035 --> 01:14:33.571
SAM: I can't see any of our fucking opponents.

01:14:33.571 --> 01:14:34.928
MATT: Nope!

01:14:34.928 --> 01:14:38.274
SAM: This sucks!

01:14:38.274 --> 01:14:40.644
LAURA: Can Bigby pick you up?

01:14:40.644 --> 01:14:42.070
TRAVIS: Wait, where did she go?

01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:43.390
MARISHA: Yeah, where is she?

01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:45.298
MATT: She jumped up on the top of the tower.

01:14:45.298 --> 01:14:46.895
MARISHA: Oh. Bitch.

01:14:46.895 --> 01:14:53.245
SAM: We won, guys! They left!

01:14:53.245 --> 01:14:55.537
TRAVIS: We could flee.

01:14:55.537 --> 01:15:10.971
SAM: No thanks. Shit. As my bonus action, I will
have Bigby lift me up as high as I can go. See if

01:15:10.971 --> 01:15:12.826
I can see any of these fuckers.

01:15:12.826 --> 01:15:15.414
MATT: Okay, so you're changing it from the
interposing hand to a lift?

01:15:15.414 --> 01:15:16.490
SAM: Yes.

01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:22.864
MATT: Okay. So we'll say Bigby is pretty easy to
lift you up. How far can you move Bigby in a turn?

01:15:22.864 --> 01:15:26.391
SAM: 60 foot movement. It takes a couple feet to
get to me, too, right?

01:15:26.391 --> 01:15:33.419
MATT: Yeah, so it would take ten, I'll say 15 feet
to scoop you up, so there's another 45 feet that

01:15:33.419 --> 01:15:34.983
you can rise up if you want to.

01:15:34.983 --> 01:15:37.244
TRAVIS: Remember, we can hold until we see them,
right?

01:15:37.244 --> 01:15:41.388
LAURA: Yes, we can. But you can't move after, you 
can only do your action.

01:15:41.388 --> 01:15:50.663
MATT: Bigby's Hand can lift you up to about there.
So you can see, with half cover, the erinyes down

01:15:50.663 --> 01:15:54.555
there, and three-quarters cover from the--

01:15:54.555 --> 01:16:00.088
SAM: Oh, I can see them now? Oh, that's great! How
far away are they from me?

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:07.824
MATT: It's hard to say. I'd say probably anywhere
between 50, 60 feet? The erinyes is a little

01:16:07.824 --> 01:16:10.282
closer. She's maybe 35, 40 feet from you.

01:16:10.282 --> 01:16:22.581
SAM: (softly) Fuck. All right, I will-- shit. I
don't care about the fucking erinyes thing. If I

01:16:22.581 --> 01:16:26.812
take a lightning shot at the pit fiend, will I hit
Vax?

01:16:26.812 --> 01:16:28.913
MATT: You can probably aim it so it wouldn't.

01:16:28.913 --> 01:16:32.191
SAM: Can I get it so close to him that he's
frightened for a second?

01:16:32.191 --> 01:16:33.889
MATT: Sure, you can do that!

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:47.559
SAM: It's such a weak attack, though. Shit. Shit!
All right, sure, I'll take it. I'll do a Lightning

01:16:47.559 --> 01:16:55.123
Bolt-- No! I'm not, I'm going to hold my attack
until one of them gets closer. I'm going to hold a

01:16:55.123 --> 01:16:57.246
spell. Do I have to declare it now?

01:16:57.246 --> 01:16:59.066
MATT: You have to declare the spell.

01:16:59.066 --> 01:17:00.342
SAM: Shit.

01:17:00.342 --> 01:17:02.164
MATT: And whatever the trigger is.

01:17:02.164 --> 01:17:13.354
SAM: Shit. I will hold Otiluke's Resilient Sphere
until the pit fiend comes within range.

01:17:13.354 --> 01:17:14.676
MATT: And who are you casting it on?

01:17:14.676 --> 01:17:15.846
SAM: The pit fiend.

01:17:15.846 --> 01:17:19.286
MATT: Okay, good to know. All right, Pike, you're
up.

01:17:19.286 --> 01:17:23.072
ASHLEY: Okay! Hello, everybody!

01:17:23.072 --> 01:17:25.973
LIAM: Oh, hi, Pike!

01:17:25.973 --> 01:17:29.555
ASHLEY: Okay, so where am I?

01:17:29.555 --> 01:17:34.668
MATT: You are inside the mansion, the doorway of
which is right there. It's this tiny little spot

01:17:34.668 --> 01:17:39.880
there. You don't see any of your friends, except
for Trinket, who's across the way. You

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:44.348
occasionally hear bouts of battle outside. To
really see what's going on, you'd have to step out

01:17:44.348 --> 01:17:45.945
of the mansion.

01:17:45.945 --> 01:17:57.343
ASHLEY: Okay, so the door is open? Okay. Can I pop
out? How close am I to either of the bad guys?

01:17:57.343 --> 01:18:04.540
MATT: Not at all. As you step out, you don't see
either of them. They are currently not visible

01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:05.733
from your perspective.

01:18:05.733 --> 01:18:09.170
TRAVIS: One of them is way up on a tower, and one
is on the other side of a row of buildings from you.

01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:10.822
MATT: But she doesn't know that.

01:18:10.822 --> 01:18:16.515
ASHLEY: Okay, am I close to Vax at all, if I peek
out?

01:18:16.515 --> 01:18:19.770
LIAM: You don't even know how fucked up I am,
probably.

01:18:19.770 --> 01:18:21.521
MARISHA: You're kind of close to me.

01:18:21.521 --> 01:18:24.653
MATT: The downside of hiding in a mansion. Good
news is, you're defended. Bad news is, you don't

01:18:24.653 --> 01:18:25.823
know what's going on.

01:18:25.823 --> 01:18:28.159
MARISHA: You can see me and Grog, and that's
pretty much it.

01:18:28.159 --> 01:18:31.792
MATT: And Scanlan, way up in the air above you,
being held by Bigby's Hand.

01:18:31.792 --> 01:18:40.108
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to pop out and I'm going
to heal Keyleth, because you're hurting?

01:18:40.108 --> 01:18:41.940
MARISHA: Yeah, I am. Thank you!

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:45.897
ASHLEY: Okay, here I come!

01:18:45.897 --> 01:18:51.600
LAURA: Oh wait, don't forget, Ashley, you have the
Spiritual Weapon up as a bonus action!

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.059
MATT: Yeah, you can move it 20 feet.

01:18:53.059 --> 01:19:03.716
ASHLEY: Ooh! Okay. Am I close to her? Sorry, I
can't see the map. You all look like little

01:19:03.716 --> 01:19:05.143
pixelated blocks.

01:19:05.143 --> 01:19:07.720
MATT: Understood. You're about 30 feet from
Keyleth.

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:13.754
ASHLEY: Okay. So I'm going to cast Healing Word,
then, since I can't touch her.

01:19:13.754 --> 01:19:15.283
MATT: Okay.

01:19:15.283 --> 01:19:32.750
ASHLEY: (mumbling) Sorry guys, this is taking a
minute. Okay, well, you heal nine points.

01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:34.902
MATT: There you go, Keyleth.

01:19:34.902 --> 01:19:38.682
SAM: Keyleth, your hair's still on fire.

01:19:38.682 --> 01:19:40.807
MARISHA: Oh, shit, dammit.

01:19:40.807 --> 01:19:46.159
ASHLEY: So, the bonus, is the Spiritual Weapon
still out there?

01:19:46.159 --> 01:19:52.038
MATT: It is. It's floating up in the air, about 15
feet up, in this alleyway here. You don't really

01:19:52.038 --> 01:19:56.151
know where any targets are at the moment, but you
can still move it 20 feet if you want to.

01:19:56.151 --> 01:20:00.538
ASHLEY: Can I move it 20 feet closer to them?

01:20:00.538 --> 01:20:02.244
MATT: You don't know where either of them are.

01:20:02.244 --> 01:20:07.689
ASHLEY: All right, I'll leave it if I can't see.
That'll be my turn.

01:20:07.689 --> 01:20:12.243
MATT: All right, that's the end of Pike's turn.
Top of the round, Vex, you're up. You're still

01:20:12.243 --> 01:20:13.748
inside the mansion.

01:20:13.748 --> 01:20:17.981
LAURA: I come out of the mansion. I want to fly
out of the mansion on my broom.

01:20:17.981 --> 01:20:21.309
MATT: All right, you fly out of the mansion on
your broom.

01:20:21.309 --> 01:20:22.965
SAM: Where you going, Vex?

01:20:22.965 --> 01:20:29.730
LAURA: I don't know! I fly up in the air and
see-- My goal was just to come out, spin around,

01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:32.790
and attack, but I don't see anything. So I want to
be about there.

01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:39.278
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this that
you're pretty close to Scanlan. So as you swoop up

01:20:39.278 --> 01:20:45.325
to the side, you can see just barely aspects of
the two of them, hiding behind edges of rooftops

01:20:45.325 --> 01:20:46.488
and towers.

01:20:46.488 --> 01:20:49.397
LAURA: Okay, I don't want to actually be that
close to Scanlan, though, for the actual--

01:20:49.397 --> 01:20:51.266
MATT: So, over here.

01:20:51.266 --> 01:20:52.196
LAURA: Yeah.

01:20:52.196 --> 01:20:55.044
SAM: As she floats away, I try to grab her butt.

01:20:55.044 --> 01:21:00.536
LAURA: I want to shoot a couple of arrows at the
pit fiend. Is he under cover?

01:21:00.536 --> 01:21:03.527
MATT: Yes, he has three-quarters cover, so he has
plus five to his armor class.

01:21:03.527 --> 01:21:05.747
LAURA: Can I be any closer so I wouldn't have
that?

01:21:05.747 --> 01:21:08.161
MATT: To get high enough to even see him, that's
going to be your full movement.

01:21:08.161 --> 01:21:09.652
LAURA: Okay.

01:21:09.652 --> 01:21:13.393
LIAM: Why not do your full movement? It doesn't
take away from your actions.

01:21:13.393 --> 01:21:15.524
LAURA: No, that's what he said. It's my full
movement just to see him.

01:21:15.524 --> 01:21:16.909
LIAM: Oh, for another full movement.

01:21:16.909 --> 01:21:18.205
LAURA: Yeah.

01:21:18.205 --> 01:21:24.588
MATT: So you rolled a nat one? First arrow arcs
off in the distance.

01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:28.072
TRAVIS: This is the least amount of d20s that
she's ever had in that tray.

01:21:28.072 --> 01:21:34.829
LAURA: I have four ones that are, right now, in
jail. Second attack is a 29.

01:21:34.829 --> 01:21:37.435
MATT: 29 hits, yeah. Even with the three-quarters
cover.

01:21:37.435 --> 01:21:48.397
LAURA: Great, cool, tight, awesome! 20.

01:21:48.397 --> 01:21:51.334
MATT: All right, 20 points of damage. Nice.

01:21:51.334 --> 01:21:53.611
SAM: Looking pretty rough?

01:21:53.611 --> 01:21:56.638
MATT: You can barely see him.

01:21:56.638 --> 01:22:02.852
LAURA: And then, for Trinket's action, can he run
up after Grog on the roof? Can he try to scramble up?

01:22:02.852 --> 01:22:07.972
MATT: Trinket's full movement, he can get there
and start trying to climb. Go ahead and roll an

01:22:07.972 --> 01:22:10.624
athletics check for Trinket.

01:22:10.624 --> 01:22:18.311
LAURA: He rolled really low. What is that, just
strength?

01:22:18.311 --> 01:22:19.963
MATT: Yeah, for him.

01:22:19.963 --> 01:22:21.435
LAURA: So he rolled five.

01:22:21.435 --> 01:22:26.507
MATT: Trinket is leaving these giant claw marks on
the outside of the building. Not quite getting

01:22:26.507 --> 01:22:29.761
there. Starting to break the side of the stand
that's next to him.

01:22:29.761 --> 01:22:32.198
LAURA: Wow, I've got to get some more 20s out
here.

01:22:32.198 --> 01:22:35.977
MATT: Actually, at this point, too, a number of
the individuals on the street that are watching,

01:22:35.977 --> 01:22:40.884
as you're starting to move around, people are
starting to back away and leave the space. These

01:22:40.884 --> 01:22:45.848
two guys disappear and start heading out of the
street to get away from everything. These guys all

01:22:45.848 --> 01:22:54.685
begin to move this direction to get away from it
all, pulling their various chained servants with them.

01:22:54.685 --> 01:22:57.061
TRAVIS: Anyone staying and watching? Eating
popcorn?

01:22:57.061 --> 01:23:02.574
MATT: No, for the most part, once they realized
the scope of what's going on, they were like, "We

01:23:02.574 --> 01:23:06.353
"should get out of the way." Ending Vex's turn,
Keyleth, you're up.

01:23:06.353 --> 01:23:14.420
MARISHA: Okay, do I have any view on Big Pharma?

01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:17.345
MATT: No, you have no visual on either of them.

01:23:17.345 --> 01:23:22.426
MARISHA: Okay. Is he peeking off, like if I
shifted around, would I be able to see a little?

01:23:22.426 --> 01:23:26.154
MATT: You could try. You saw him disappear behind
the roof, but you don't see him.

01:23:26.154 --> 01:23:33.199
MARISHA: I'm going to try and shift toward you, to
see if I can see him around the lava bend.

01:23:33.199 --> 01:23:40.186
MATT: Around this way? Okay, you get your full
movement there. Currently no view of him.

01:23:40.186 --> 01:23:56.094
MARISHA: Okay. Can I take my action to go ahead
and cast Sunbeam and then hold it until I see him?

01:23:56.094 --> 01:24:01.290
MATT: What you would do is, you would begin
casting the spell and hold your action of casting

01:24:01.290 --> 01:24:02.355
Sunbeam.

01:24:02.355 --> 01:24:03.539
MARISHA: That's what I want to do.

01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:04.847
MATT: Okay, and what's the trigger for it?

01:24:04.847 --> 01:24:06.031
MARISHA: Whenever I see him.

01:24:06.031 --> 01:24:11.049
MATT: Visual? Okay, good to know. That's the end
of Keyleth's turn. Grog, you're up.

01:24:11.049 --> 01:24:17.088
TRAVIS: Yeah, can I move to the tippy-top of the
roof and, frustrated with my inability to follow

01:24:17.088 --> 01:24:24.123
this winged piece of shit, can I take the
Titanstone Knuckles and slam them together, and

01:24:24.123 --> 01:24:25.726
enlarge myself?

01:24:25.726 --> 01:24:31.113
MATT: Yes you can! With what sounds like a mild sound
of cracking thunder, these two sides of his

01:24:31.113 --> 01:24:37.294
gauntlets slam, causing Grog's size to swell to
astronomical proportions.

01:24:37.294 --> 01:24:40.022
LIAM: That's just a wee jump to that tower now!

01:24:40.022 --> 01:24:47.318
TRAVIS: That's what I was hoping for, but we'll
see. But I have to ask. So that ornamental thing

01:24:47.318 --> 01:24:52.643
that's above the doorway of the tower, does it
look like something I might be able to make a

01:24:52.643 --> 01:24:58.246
leap, with my Boots of Feral Leaping, and start a
very rudimentary climbing up the side of the

01:24:58.246 --> 01:25:02.671
tower, King Kong-style, if I wanted to try and get
up to where she is? Or would I be better suited

01:25:02.671 --> 01:25:04.019
jumping down?

01:25:04.019 --> 01:25:05.702
MATT: What are the limitations on the boots?

01:25:05.702 --> 01:25:09.879
TRAVIS: It says 15 feet straight up, or 20 feet
horizontally.

01:25:09.879 --> 01:25:12.240
MATT: Right, and there's no limitation to the
number of times it can be used?

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:18.544
TRAVIS: Bonus action, that's it. If I fail the DC,
I fall prone.

01:25:18.544 --> 01:25:23.665
MATT: Gotcha. Cool. So you could attempt to do
it.

01:25:23.665 --> 01:25:33.312
TRAVIS: Cool. Well, go big or go home. I'm going
to try and jump towards the tower and grab onto

01:25:33.312 --> 01:25:36.320
that ornamental fixture that's just above the
doorway.

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:41.663
MATT: Okay, so as you jump and leap, I need you to
make an athletics check.

01:25:41.663 --> 01:25:42.964
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:25:42.964 --> 01:25:45.106
LAURA: I feel like you could make it to the top
edge.

01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:48.144
SAM: Let him do his parkour, people.

01:25:48.144 --> 01:25:52.910
TRAVIS: Well yeah, in essence, I would like to
jump towards the tower. If it goes better than I

01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:56.880
thought, then awesome. 21.

01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:03.117
MATT: So you leap across the way and catch onto
the side of the building there. Your fingers sink

01:26:03.117 --> 01:26:08.454
into the stone, your Titanstone Gauntlets. So
that's your bonus action. You're now holding on to

01:26:08.454 --> 01:26:09.643
the side of the building.

01:26:09.643 --> 01:26:12.707
TRAVIS: Could I use my movement to Crossfit my way
up?

01:26:12.707 --> 01:26:21.411
MATT: As you climb over the side, you do manage to
get right over (impacts) right there. You see the

01:26:21.411 --> 01:26:25.803
erinyes is ducked down with the longbow drawn,
with an arrow. Looks up and sees your much larger,

01:26:25.803 --> 01:26:30.906
now, face, grinning over the side, as you grin
back and then (impact) land on the opposite.

01:26:30.906 --> 01:26:40.160
TRAVIS: (panting) Hold on, I need a breather. Naw,
I'm just fucking about. You're dead. Can I go into

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:45.671
a frenzied-- no, that was my bonus action, so I
get two. Can I do reckless, Great Weapon

01:26:45.671 --> 01:26:48.035
Master, two attacks on She-Ra?

01:26:48.035 --> 01:26:49.938
MATT: Yes, you may.

01:26:49.938 --> 01:26:58.312
TRAVIS: 21.

01:26:58.312 --> 01:27:06.905
MATT: 21? Does hit. However, she's going to use
her reaction to parry. So, as you begin to do

01:27:06.905 --> 01:27:12.865
that, she releases the tension on the arrow, pulls
her longsword out, and parries the blade to the

01:27:12.865 --> 01:27:17.841
side. It adds four to her AC, and you miss by one.
The axe slides off and slams into the stonework

01:27:17.841 --> 01:27:20.114
next to her as she begins to step away from you.

01:27:20.114 --> 01:27:22.760
TRAVIS: Whoa. Do I know if she can do that again?

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:23.844
MATT: You don't know.

01:27:23.844 --> 01:27:28.733
TRAVIS: Right, kitten's got claws. I'll make the
second one reckless, but not Great Weapon Master.

01:27:28.733 --> 01:27:33.341
I already said it was, should I do it again
because I said it? All right, fine.

01:27:33.341 --> 01:27:36.467
LAURA: She probably can't do it again.

01:27:36.467 --> 01:27:43.013
TRAVIS: 31. Minus five, 26.

01:27:43.013 --> 01:27:44.601
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:27:44.601 --> 01:27:59.520
TRAVIS: Hey, she didn't do it again! Yahtzee. One
point of necrotic, 26, plus ten is 36.

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:06.386
MATT: 36, oof. All righty. That end your turn?

01:28:06.386 --> 01:28:10.604
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm a little attracted to the fact
that she parried my first one. I'm kind of

01:28:10.604 --> 01:28:16.404
confused. Plus, you know, we're up high in the
air, and the city's on fire. It's very romantic.

01:28:16.404 --> 01:28:19.939
MATT: Perfect.

01:28:19.939 --> 01:28:21.248
TRAVIS: That's it, that's my turn.

01:28:21.248 --> 01:28:22.377
MATT: All righty, that ends your turn. That brings
us to Vax.

01:28:22.377 --> 01:28:24.421
LIAM: All right, I'm going to use a bonus
action--

01:28:24.421 --> 01:28:29.347
MATT: At the beginning of your turn, as you're on
the edge of the roof, you see the being's right

01:28:29.347 --> 01:28:33.399
there, looming, just out of your arm's reach. I
need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

01:28:33.399 --> 01:28:40.240
LIAM: Yes. But I'm a half-elf, so I get advantage.
Let's see how I do. Pretty good! 18.

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:45.628
MATT: 18? The sheer presence of this entity shakes
you to the core. You are considered frightened

01:28:45.628 --> 01:28:46.567
right now.

01:28:46.567 --> 01:28:50.747
LIAM: Okay, so I can't go toward him, right?

01:28:50.747 --> 01:28:55.881
MATT: You cannot go toward him. While he's in the
line of sight to you, your attacks and ability

01:28:55.881 --> 01:28:57.250
checks have disadvantage.

01:28:57.250 --> 01:28:58.727
LIAM: On him, or everything?

01:28:58.727 --> 01:29:02.616
MATT: As long as he's within your line of sight,
you have disadvantage on all of your attacks and

01:29:02.616 --> 01:29:03.567
ability checks.

01:29:03.567 --> 01:29:07.649
LIAM: That's fine, I won't do fuck-all with him.
So. For my bonus action, I'm plugging my single

01:29:07.649 --> 01:29:20.641
potion of greater healing into my mouth, to start.
So that's 4d4 plus four, right? (adding) 16. Okay,

01:29:20.641 --> 01:29:26.258
I'll figure that out in a second. Then I want to
use my first action to-- He's right up on me? I'll

01:29:26.258 --> 01:29:33.017
use my first action to disengage, and then I'm
going to arc, almost go in a straight line, but

01:29:33.017 --> 01:29:37.355
arc slightly around the tower. Since Grog is right
on the erinyes, I want to throw Whisper again at

01:29:37.355 --> 01:29:45.249
her as I zing by, 20 feet away from her. Yeah?
Throw Whisper at her as I go by, and land as far

01:29:45.249 --> 01:29:48.872
away from the pit demon, because I'm so scared, as
I can.

01:29:48.872 --> 01:29:50.101
MATT: Over here?

01:29:50.101 --> 01:29:53.439
LIAM: As far away as I can get, and I can go 120
feet with movement. Hasted.

01:29:53.439 --> 01:29:58.630
MATT: In order to still be in view of the erinyes,
he's still in view of you. So you'd have

01:29:58.630 --> 01:30:00.949
disadvantage on the attack against the erinyes.
But you can go ahead and do it.

01:30:00.949 --> 01:30:05.717
LIAM: Against her? But that cancels out, because I
have advantage because Grog's right on her.

01:30:05.717 --> 01:30:09.094
MATT: You don't get advantage on the attacks for
hitting someone. You just can sneak attack them.

01:30:09.094 --> 01:30:11.875
LIAM: You're right, yes. Thank you.

01:30:11.875 --> 01:30:13.182
MATT: So disadvantage.

01:30:13.182 --> 01:30:17.025
LIAM: Disadvantage on the attack. Oh, balls. One.

01:30:17.025 --> 01:30:22.421
MATT: Streaks off and returns to your side. You're
landing over here, you said?

01:30:22.421 --> 01:30:30.190
LIAM: As far as I can get, 120 feet. If there's a
nook to scoot behind in the corner, I will.

01:30:30.190 --> 01:30:31.604
MATT: You could probably scoot behind that way.

01:30:31.604 --> 01:30:32.789
LIAM: All right.

01:30:32.789 --> 01:30:39.031
MATT: All righty. Great.

01:30:39.031 --> 01:30:43.703
LAURA: Is that her name? It's definitely Gamora.

01:30:43.703 --> 01:30:49.323
TRAVIS: I should ask her her name, you know. I'm
going to be right on her in a second.

01:30:49.323 --> 01:30:51.237
SAM: Maybe she has a nametag.

01:30:51.237 --> 01:30:53.376
MATT: So, that ends Vax's turn. Percy, you're up.

01:30:53.376 --> 01:30:59.987
TALIESIN: There's not much I can do, so I'm going
to run towards that next set of buildings and

01:30:59.987 --> 01:31:05.118
recover next to the fountain. That you can't see.

01:31:05.118 --> 01:31:07.047
MATT: Which way? This way?

01:31:07.047 --> 01:31:08.564
TALIESIN: Nope, the other way.

01:31:08.564 --> 01:31:10.160
MATT: Okay, so you're going to run over this way?

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:16.492
TALIESIN: Yep, I'm going to burn the whole thing
and then, see that fountain right there? Full

01:31:16.492 --> 01:31:21.609
movement. Okay, not that far, the other side of
the fountain. I'm hiding in that corner.

01:31:21.609 --> 01:31:25.114
MATT: Okay, good. That ends your turn.

01:31:25.114 --> 01:31:28.307
TALIESIN: That actually-- did that burn my
action?

01:31:28.307 --> 01:31:32.792
MATT: To get there, that'd have to be a dash. It's
a move and dash.

01:31:32.792 --> 01:31:39.621
TALIESIN: Actually, how far could I have gone
without burning my action? I'm so sorry.

01:31:39.621 --> 01:31:41.666
MATT: You would have gotten onto the bridge
there.

01:31:41.666 --> 01:31:48.168
SAM: Stay true to yourself, Taliesin.

01:31:48.168 --> 01:31:51.446
TRAVIS: Touch yourself, Taliesin.

01:31:51.446 --> 01:31:53.256
LIAM: Stay true to Percy.

01:31:53.256 --> 01:31:57.510
TALIESIN: No, that's fair. I'm just trying to get
somewhere.

01:31:57.510 --> 01:32:16.142
MATT: All right, so. Beginning of this turn. The
pit fiend, Ghurrix, is going to then, its claws

01:32:16.142 --> 01:32:22.304
dug into the side of the roof, (roars) dart
upward, wings out, in an upward arc toward Scanlan

01:32:22.304 --> 01:32:24.968
and Vex.

01:32:24.968 --> 01:32:28.933
LAURA: Remember, I'm not directly next to him.
That's why I said I wasn't.

01:32:28.933 --> 01:32:30.481
MATT: I'm moving this away.

01:32:30.481 --> 01:32:35.145
TRAVIS: Let the man fly.

01:32:35.145 --> 01:32:40.028
MATT: Technically, Scanlan is there, and you're
back that way because you went straight up out of

01:32:40.028 --> 01:32:41.742
the entranceway. Right?

01:32:41.742 --> 01:32:43.105
LAURA: Sure.

01:32:43.105 --> 01:32:52.654
MATT: Right there? Takes up, you go ahead and get
the Sunbeam, and you do, yes.

01:32:52.654 --> 01:32:54.894
SAM: Mine's first.

01:32:54.894 --> 01:33:01.882
MATT: So as soon as it appears up in the side
there, you're doing Otiluke's Resilient Sphere?

01:33:01.882 --> 01:33:03.472
SAM: Handcone up, yes.

01:33:03.472 --> 01:33:13.188
MATT: Otiluke's Resilient Sphere. That is a large
creature. Dexterity saving throw.

01:33:13.188 --> 01:33:15.145
MARISHA: Can my sunbeam go through the sphere?

01:33:15.145 --> 01:33:18.575
MATT: No, it cannot.

01:33:18.575 --> 01:33:23.459
MARISHA: Can I please sunbeam first? God dammit,
Scanlan.

01:33:23.459 --> 01:33:26.773
MATT: It's okay. That is a 24.

01:33:26.773 --> 01:33:31.152
SAM: What was the lower of those two rolls?
Because I have advantage.

01:33:31.152 --> 01:33:33.308
MATT: The lower, that was 21.

01:33:33.308 --> 01:33:34.660
SAM: That's my DC.

01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:36.290
MATT: So he makes it.

01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:37.975
SAM: Fucking shit!

01:33:37.975 --> 01:33:43.626
MATT: Although technically, because he has
advantage on the saving throw and you gave him

01:33:43.626 --> 01:33:49.819
disadvantage, it would've been the first roll. So
yeah, it would've been 24. Sorry. So as the sphere

01:33:49.819 --> 01:33:53.676
begins to condense around him, he shatters it.
However, your Sunbeam does still--

01:33:53.676 --> 01:33:56.233
MARISHA: Yeah, he's probably going to save from
that too.

01:33:56.233 --> 01:33:58.105
LAURA: Just try it, man. Just try it.

01:33:58.105 --> 01:34:04.623
MATT: So, as you watch him appear in the air, you
finish the spell and release the beam, arcing past

01:34:04.623 --> 01:34:06.584
like a laser across the sky.

01:34:06.584 --> 01:34:11.415
MARISHA: (lazer zapping) It's a constitution
saving throw.

01:34:11.415 --> 01:34:20.445
MATT: Constitution saving throw? That is 19.

01:34:20.445 --> 01:34:23.351
MARISHA: That's my DC.

01:34:23.351 --> 01:34:24.799
MATT: So he saves it.

01:34:24.799 --> 01:34:26.743
TALIESIN: Wait, wait! (mumbling)

01:34:26.743 --> 01:34:30.382
MARISHA: No, that's a plus two to spell attack
rolls. I can't use my--?

01:34:30.382 --> 01:34:36.037
MATT: It still hits, he just takes half damage and
isn't blinded.

01:34:36.037 --> 01:34:40.464
MARISHA: It's radiant damage, and he's not
blinded. Which would have been so cool.

01:34:40.464 --> 01:34:44.068
MATT: So go ahead and roll your damage.

01:34:44.068 --> 01:34:46.532
MARISHA: Does he take extra because it's radiant?

01:34:46.532 --> 01:34:55.799
MATT: Nope. Leaps over and flies up right between
the two of you, who are hovering up like this

01:34:55.799 --> 01:34:57.403
bright beacon in the sky.

01:34:57.403 --> 01:35:02.395
SAM: Except I'm falling, because that was a
concentration spell. Bigby's gone.

01:35:02.395 --> 01:35:04.021
MATT: Oh, that's right!

01:35:04.021 --> 01:35:06.468
LAURA: That is actually going to help you, dude.

01:35:06.468 --> 01:35:14.826
MATT: All righty! So you go ahead and-- Did you
make your concentration save against that?

01:35:14.826 --> 01:35:17.192
SAM: My concentration save?

01:35:17.192 --> 01:35:22.038
MATT: Oh, Otiluke's was, correct, yeah. So you're
falling.

01:35:22.038 --> 01:35:25.437
MARISHA: He takes nine points of damage, by the
way.

01:35:25.437 --> 01:35:29.441
SAM: Nine points! Yeah, Keyleth!

01:35:29.441 --> 01:35:32.430
LAURA: Jesus, we're all going to die.

01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:39.414
MATT: So you take, Scanlan--

01:35:39.414 --> 01:35:43.273
SAM: Do I get any kind of athletic move?

01:35:43.330 --> 01:35:45.922
MATT: No. 14 points of bludgeoning damage and--

01:35:45.922 --> 01:35:49.838
SAM: Am I in the lava?

01:35:49.838 --> 01:35:56.191
MATT: You are about to stumble into it. The heat
is so extreme at that point that you-- So, you

01:35:56.191 --> 01:36:01.776
take 14 points of bludgeoning damage, plus an
additional ten points of fire damage due to

01:36:01.776 --> 01:36:09.448
proximity to heat, as the lava's right at the heel
of your boots right now. All right. So, as it

01:36:09.448 --> 01:36:10.663
lands next to you--

01:36:10.663 --> 01:36:13.173
LAURA: That's going to be better for him, though,
than getting these hits.

01:36:13.173 --> 01:36:15.839
MATT: It's going to unleash a full series of
attacks against you.

01:36:15.839 --> 01:36:18.608
LAURA: Instead of shared, great. Yay.

01:36:18.608 --> 01:36:22.055
SAM: Bye! I'll take lava, bye!

01:36:22.055 --> 01:36:24.899
MATT: That's a 28.

01:36:24.899 --> 01:36:26.193
LAURA: Of course.

01:36:26.193 --> 01:36:27.827
MATT: With the claw attack. So, you suffer--

01:36:27.827 --> 01:36:32.279
LAURA: You better use Cutting Words on him, for
one of these things.

01:36:32.279 --> 01:36:34.461
SAM: Aaah, the lava, I can't concentrate!

01:36:34.461 --> 01:36:38.628
MATT: 18 points of slashing damage for the first
one.

01:36:38.628 --> 01:36:40.261
MARISHA: Such a troll tonight!

01:36:40.261 --> 01:37:02.987
MATT: The bite attack is 25. This here, you take
15 points of piercing damage-- Sorry, 15 plus

01:37:02.987 --> 01:37:09.676
eight. So 23 points of piercing damage, total. I
need you to make a constitution saving throw.

01:37:09.676 --> 01:37:16.186
LAURA: Tight. Cool, that is a four.

01:37:16.186 --> 01:37:22.721
MATT: Okay, so you are now poisoned as the fangs
poison your body. You feel it pulsing through

01:37:22.721 --> 01:37:23.966
yourself.

01:37:23.966 --> 01:37:25.656
LAURA: Okay.

01:37:25.656 --> 01:37:29.274
MATT: And you suffer--

01:37:29.274 --> 01:37:34.266
LAURA: I've got to get my calculator out to find
out if I'm about to die.

01:37:34.266 --> 01:37:38.334
MATT: 25 points of poison damage from failing the
save.

01:37:38.334 --> 01:37:43.772
SAM: Matthew? Would I have the wherewithal to see
what's going on and try to--

01:37:43.772 --> 01:37:48.946
MATT: You see white, right now, as you slam onto
your back and (groaning) the ringing in your ears

01:37:48.946 --> 01:37:55.287
as this is happening. The tail attack is a 29 to
hit.

01:37:55.287 --> 01:37:58.602
TRAVIS: I think that misses.

01:37:58.602 --> 01:38:01.475
LAURA: Yeah, no, that one doesn't hit, but the
rest of them do.

01:38:01.475 --> 01:38:08.677
MATT: That is some bad rolls, actually. 16 points
of bludgeoning damage.

01:38:08.677 --> 01:38:11.575
ASHLEY: That's &lt;i&gt;enough&lt;/i&gt;.

01:38:11.575 --> 01:38:16.063
MATT: And the mace. 25 to hit on the mace.

01:38:16.063 --> 01:38:18.699
LAURA: Okay, yeah, cool, tight.

01:38:18.699 --> 01:38:28.376
MATT: So, you suffer 18 points of bludgeoning
damage, so mark that.

01:38:28.376 --> 01:38:30.454
LAURA: Oh, I thought that's what I just did?

01:38:30.454 --> 01:38:32.562
MATT: Well, you took another 18 from the mace
hitting you.

01:38:32.562 --> 01:38:35.014
LAURA: He got four attacks, right?

01:38:35.014 --> 01:38:38.971
MATT: Yeah, this is the last attack. So, 18
plus--

01:38:38.971 --> 01:38:44.444
LAURA: Right? That was already the 18? Or was it?

01:38:44.444 --> 01:38:47.065
SAM: Well, some of the attacks, they add more
poison to it.

01:38:47.065 --> 01:38:49.949
LAURA: Oh, jesus. Okay.

01:38:49.949 --> 01:38:57.402
MATT: So you took the 18 bludgeoning damage, plus
an additional 15 points of fire damage.

01:38:57.402 --> 01:38:59.518
LAURA: Cool, I'm unconscious.

01:38:59.518 --> 01:39:08.984
MATT: With that, all of a sudden you watch as the
mace slams Vex in the side. Her form goes limp,

01:39:08.984 --> 01:39:12.547
arcing through the air. The broom spinning off and
scattering across--

01:39:12.547 --> 01:39:15.734
LAURA: No, it's attached to me. It is attached.

01:39:15.734 --> 01:39:25.643
MATT: So, it's spinning and scattering behind you
as you arc over at the impact, that way--

01:39:25.643 --> 01:39:27.789
ASHLEY: Right by me.

01:39:27.789 --> 01:39:32.495
MATT: I'm going to roll a scatter die on this.

01:39:32.495 --> 01:39:36.403
SAM: Scatter die! What is that?

01:39:36.403 --> 01:39:45.176
MATT: That's a three. You arc this way, so you
fall and land onto the stonework, there.

01:39:45.176 --> 01:39:46.799
LAURA: Right next to Pike!

01:39:46.799 --> 01:39:52.568
MARISHA: You got your wish! Her body just landed
at your feet.

01:39:52.568 --> 01:39:55.843
LAURA: Does that mean that's an automatic death
save failure, though?

01:39:55.843 --> 01:39:59.965
MATT: From the fall and impact, yeah. So you
automatically suffer one failed death saving

01:39:59.965 --> 01:40:06.563
throw, from the impact. Pike, you watch as Vex,
crack! onto the stonework there, one of her legs

01:40:06.563 --> 01:40:08.578
hanging off to the side.

01:40:08.578 --> 01:40:15.702
LAURA: Oh, off of the stonework, not off of my
body. I was like, just like that, huh?

01:40:15.702 --> 01:40:21.668
MATT: No, you smack. There's no bounce to this.
Might've been worse if it had.

01:40:21.668 --> 01:40:23.151
MARISHA: It's like Left 4 Dead physics.

01:40:23.151 --> 01:40:31.985
MATT: Yeah, kinda. Just, crack! So that's going to
end the pit fiend's turn. The erinyes is--

01:40:31.985 --> 01:40:35.642
LIAM: That was a Dickens novel.

01:40:35.642 --> 01:40:40.245
MATT: She's going to attempt to move away from
you. She does not want to be close to you.

01:40:40.245 --> 01:40:44.263
TRAVIS: No, no, no, I am really a nice guy, when
you get to-- &lt;i&gt;Get the fuck over here.&lt;/i&gt;

01:40:44.263 --> 01:40:46.824
MATT: Yeah. Go ahead and take your attack of
opportunity.

01:40:46.824 --> 01:40:59.481
TRAVIS: Reckless, great. I'm going to give this a
29 minus five, is a 24.

01:40:59.481 --> 01:41:01.258
MATT: 24, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:41:01.258 --> 01:41:05.933
SAM: We're having a fight! Oh, oh sorry.

01:41:05.933 --> 01:41:20.060
TRAVIS: Five points of necrotic, (adding) 38. Oh,
oh, oh! Enlarged. 39.

01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:29.016
MATT: Nice. Darts off this way and, taking the
impact, you see she's starting to look a little

01:41:29.016 --> 01:41:40.089
rough. Pulls in the side with her longbow. She's
going to take three shots at-- you're on the

01:41:40.089 --> 01:42:00.441
ground, you just fell out of the sky and impacted.
She's going to take three shots at Scanlan.

01:42:00.441 --> 01:42:05.277
Actually, you're prone on the ground, so you're
going to be harder for her to hit. Three shots at

01:42:05.277 --> 01:42:13.120
Keyleth. That is a 28 to hit.

01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:14.523
MARISHA: Heh, yeah.

01:42:14.523 --> 01:42:19.902
MATT: That is a 19 to hit.

01:42:19.902 --> 01:42:21.523
MARISHA: Yep.

01:42:21.523 --> 01:42:23.660
MATT: 18 to hit.

01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:28.496
MARISHA: Does inspiration help negate? All three
hit.

01:42:28.496 --> 01:42:40.401
MATT: All three hit, okay. So you suffer, let's
see. Each one of these is poisoned. I need you to

01:42:40.401 --> 01:42:42.654
make a constitution saving throw, by the way.

01:42:42.654 --> 01:42:44.063
MARISHA: Just one?

01:42:44.063 --> 01:42:46.712
MATT: Three, technically.

01:42:46.712 --> 01:42:51.080
LAURA: Don't forget, Scanlan, you've been getting
five extra hit points at the start of your turn.

01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:55.560
MATT: Scanlan does not.

01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:57.744
LAURA: Oh, it's just the hit point max, okay.

01:42:57.744 --> 01:42:59.899
MATT: Yeah, but Scanlan also lost that because he
cast it on the--

01:42:59.899 --> 01:43:02.706
MARISHA: Oh that's right, I've got that, at the
top of my turn.

01:43:02.706 --> 01:43:05.343
SAM: Wait, but she did something.

01:43:05.343 --> 01:43:07.035
LAURA: Yeah, Pike cast Aid.

01:43:07.035 --> 01:43:09.460
MATT: You would actually have probably lost
concentration on that when you took all the

01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:10.452
damage.

01:43:10.452 --> 01:43:11.562
LIAM: Did I roll for that?

01:43:11.562 --> 01:43:15.699
MATT: I forgot to do that, because I'm not used to
you casting. Roll four constitution saving throws.

01:43:15.699 --> 01:43:23.057
LIAM: Ha, I'm sure I lost it. How do I do this?
First one's a natural 20.

01:43:23.057 --> 01:43:25.780
SAM: Just three more natural 20s.

01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:28.570
MATT: Your constitution saving throw.

01:43:28.570 --> 01:43:37.183
LIAM: Oh, the zero? Cool. 19. 15. 16.

01:43:37.183 --> 01:43:40.931
MATT: Yeah, we'll say you maintained it.

01:43:40.931 --> 01:43:43.431
(cheering)

01:43:43.431 --> 01:43:54.688
MARISHA: Okay, first one was 21. Second one's 15.
Third one, heh, is a natural one.

01:43:54.688 --> 01:44:07.540
MATT: Okay, so you are poisoned. So you take, on
all three hits, the first one is going to be 17

01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:26.104
points of damage. That was crazy, I rolled four
sevens. 28 for the second hit. 18 for the third

01:44:26.104 --> 01:44:31.140
hit. So there you go.

01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:32.973
MARISHA: Okay.

01:44:32.973 --> 01:44:40.313
TALIESIN: She's not fine, but she's not down.

01:44:40.313 --> 01:44:47.170
MATT: And then the erinyes ducks behind the side,
there, to try and gain some cover off the wall.

01:44:47.170 --> 01:44:51.042
That's going to bring us to Scanlan.

01:44:51.042 --> 01:44:53.700
SAM: Me? What happened to Percy?

01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:57.943
TRAVIS: Pike's next. I mean, Pike is after you.

01:44:57.943 --> 01:45:09.409
SAM: Oh, because I was holding my turn. So now
we're up to me? Okay. Oh, great, this is fun. I'll

01:45:09.409 --> 01:45:24.383
stand up out of the lava. There's a guy above me,
right? The pit fiend? Wow, that's fun. Yep, okay,

01:45:24.383 --> 01:45:39.428
sure. Wait, who's dead? Okay, I'll Healing Word
the dead person, the Vex. I will sing to her,

01:45:39.428 --> 01:45:49.707
(singing) Don't you give up, no, no, no! I won't
give up, no, no, no! Let me heal you! Let me heal you!

01:45:49.707 --> 01:45:51.977
TRAVIS: The harmony on that was--

01:45:51.977 --> 01:45:53.477
LAURA: That was amazing.

01:45:53.477 --> 01:46:02.446
SAM: That's a d4 plus six. That's so weak. Okay,
you got seven points.

01:46:02.446 --> 01:46:04.934
LAURA: Hey, thanks, man! Now me and Keyleth have
the same amount of hit points!

01:46:04.934 --> 01:46:07.857
MARISHA: Lucky number seven!

01:46:07.857 --> 01:46:19.749
SAM: I will move away from the sniper fire, so
where Taliesin used to be, where Percy used to be.

01:46:19.749 --> 01:46:23.549
MATT: That's as far as you can get, is right
there.

01:46:23.549 --> 01:46:25.835
SAM: That's fine, just as long as the sniper can't
get me.

01:46:25.835 --> 01:46:30.071
MATT: The sniper can still get you. With 25
movement, you can't get far enough away, unless

01:46:30.071 --> 01:46:32.467
you want to use your action to dash.

01:46:32.467 --> 01:46:40.146
SAM: No thank you. How high, he would be--?

01:46:40.146 --> 01:46:43.487
MATT: Actually, technically, you used half your
movement for prone, so you can only get that far.

01:46:43.487 --> 01:46:45.756
SAM: Oh. Is there anything I can hide behind?

01:46:45.756 --> 01:46:47.019
MATT: Currently, no.

01:46:47.019 --> 01:46:48.642
SAM: Can I hide behind Pike?

01:46:48.642 --> 01:46:50.503
MATT: You can't get that far.

01:46:50.503 --> 01:46:53.508
SAM: Jump in the lava?

01:46:53.508 --> 01:46:55.561
MATT: If you want to.

01:46:55.561 --> 01:47:09.792
SAM: Okay, let's just say that, shit. Yep, I don't
know what to do. Well, if I can't move out of the

01:47:09.792 --> 01:47:16.777
way then I'll try to Lightning Bolt the pit fiend.
I mean, we're trying to kill the pit fiend, right?

01:47:16.777 --> 01:47:21.039
That's not going to do shit to a pit fiend.

01:47:21.039 --> 01:47:23.022
LAURA: Can you try the sphere again?

01:47:23.022 --> 01:47:28.903
SAM: Pit fiend would be 45 feet up, right? So I
cannot, because I can only get 30 feet. I could

01:47:28.903 --> 01:47:30.210
hop and do it.

01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:31.759
ASHLEY: Is he looking rough?

01:47:31.759 --> 01:47:35.434
LAURA: No, not even close. But &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; is! She's
looking a little torn up.

01:47:35.434 --> 01:47:37.918
TRAVIS: But she's further away.

01:47:37.918 --> 01:47:41.979
SAM: I will hold my action until the pit fiend
comes in range.

01:47:41.979 --> 01:47:43.200
MATT: And what are you going to do?

01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:45.118
SAM: Otiluke's Resilient Sphere.

01:47:45.118 --> 01:47:48.663
TALIESIN: That's a great idea.

01:47:48.663 --> 01:47:51.155
LIAM: (singing) If at first you don't succeed--

01:47:51.155 --> 01:47:53.144
TRAVIS: Give up and run away.

01:47:53.144 --> 01:47:56.038
LAURA: Yeah. Oh my god, this is a serious thing,
though.

01:47:56.038 --> 01:47:59.233
MATT: Okay, so. Scanlan's holding his turn. Pike,
what are you doing?

01:47:59.233 --> 01:48:04.001
ASHLEY: Okay, am I even near Keyleth at all, or
no?

01:48:04.001 --> 01:48:11.127
MATT: You're about roughly 50 feet from her.

01:48:11.127 --> 01:48:16.535
AHSLEY: So, if I go in the middle, can I do a Mass
Cure Wounds?

01:48:16.535 --> 01:48:18.616
MATT: You could, yeah.

01:48:18.616 --> 01:48:20.917
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to do that.

01:48:20.917 --> 01:48:30.190
MATT: What's the range on Mass Cure Wounds? Range
of 60 feet. Oh, in a 30 foot radius. So you'd have

01:48:30.190 --> 01:48:37.440
to move, you can get about there, move around
Scanlan, and you can get Scanlan, Vex, and

01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:39.099
Keyleth, if you wanted to.

01:48:39.099 --> 01:48:42.984
ASHLEY: Fantastic. Big money, big money.

01:48:42.984 --> 01:48:45.494
MARISHA: Come on, winner winner.

01:48:45.494 --> 01:48:51.946
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to do it at sixth level.

01:48:51.946 --> 01:48:54.587
MATT: All right, so that's 4d8 plus five.

01:48:54.587 --> 01:48:59.658
ASHLEY: Plus my spellcasting?

01:48:59.658 --> 01:49:01.781
MATT: Well, that's the plus five.

01:49:01.781 --> 01:49:08.569
ASHLEY: That's the plus five. Okay, so 4d8. Shit,
that's not a lot. Ooh!

01:49:08.569 --> 01:49:14.053
TRAVIS: That d8's very exciting.

01:49:14.053 --> 01:49:19.353
SAM: Am I affected by this? I'm going to get
health?

01:49:19.353 --> 01:49:20.918
LAURA: You're going to get healed.

01:49:20.918 --> 01:49:22.795
TRAVIS: Have you been hit?

01:49:22.795 --> 01:49:25.692
SAM: Yeah. Well, I hit myself by falling out of
the sky.

01:49:25.692 --> 01:49:29.192
ASHLEY: Okay, 31.

01:49:29.192 --> 01:49:34.476
MATT: Okay, so 31 hit points healed to Scanlan,
Keyleth, and Vex.

01:49:34.476 --> 01:49:39.548
SAM: Do I get the temporary hit points that Pike
had granted me, two turns ago?

01:49:39.548 --> 01:49:42.182
MATT: The Aid one? Yeah, you still have that,
technically.

01:49:42.182 --> 01:49:46.227
SAM: She gave me five. Okay, great.

01:49:46.227 --> 01:49:54.013
ASHLEY: As my bonus action, can I move the
Spiritual Weapon any closer to the pit fiend? Do I

01:49:54.013 --> 01:49:55.063
see him now?

01:49:55.063 --> 01:49:57.592
MATT: You can. It won't get close enough to fight,
but it does move a little closer.

01:49:57.592 --> 01:49:59.395
ASHLEY: Just to taunt him a little?

01:49:59.395 --> 01:50:01.027
MATT: Sure. It'll be about there.

01:50:01.027 --> 01:50:03.890
LAURA: Just wave it around, like, woo.

01:50:03.890 --> 01:50:09.895
MATT: Yeah. We'll say it's a little ways back. He
needs to move a little bit closer. All right, that

01:50:09.895 --> 01:50:17.589
ends your turn? Okay, at this point in time, as
you're paying attention, Percy, as you're around

01:50:17.589 --> 01:50:23.482
the corner, looking up and seeing the fiend right
there, you glance over to the right at the top of

01:50:23.482 --> 01:50:30.384
the round as you watch one of the Illuminated
begin making its way that way.

01:50:30.384 --> 01:50:31.973
TALIESIN: He's that close, already?

01:50:31.973 --> 01:50:45.282
MATT: It starts coasting up the side. It's
coasting through, seeing all these things going

01:50:45.282 --> 01:50:50.847
off, spells and shit. You see it cruising through
the air, a little bit high up, and is just

01:50:50.847 --> 01:50:56.879
arriving on the scene here, taking in the visual
perspective here. As soon as it turns around the

01:50:56.879 --> 01:51:02.777
corner, it looks at you, looks at everything
happening, and its hand goes for its weapon,

01:51:02.777 --> 01:51:09.207
looking at all of you surrounding it. Currently,
it appears to recognize the individual up above,

01:51:09.207 --> 01:51:12.867
and you all not being from here.

01:51:12.867 --> 01:51:19.192
SAM: But I look really cool with a fire beard and
stuff, so.

01:51:19.192 --> 01:51:20.780
MATT: Yeah.

01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:22.569
SAM: I look cool.

01:51:22.569 --> 01:51:29.021
MATT: You do. It sees a bunch of Vexes and Vaxes,
essentially. A bunch of slaves rising up against a

01:51:29.021 --> 01:51:34.854
pit fiend, is what it's seeing. So, top of the
round, Vex. You are prone, but conscious.

01:51:34.854 --> 01:51:38.433
LAURA: Okay. I get up.

01:51:38.433 --> 01:51:41.889
MATT: All right, so that's half your movement
there. You're still poisoned.

01:51:41.889 --> 01:51:51.318
LAURA: Oh, then I'm going to cast Protection from
Poison on myself. Wow, as my action. Well, what

01:51:51.318 --> 01:51:55.339
are you going to do? That cancels out the poison.

01:51:55.339 --> 01:52:03.212
MATT: All right, yeah, so you are no longer
poisoned. That is your action.

01:52:03.212 --> 01:52:07.440
LAURA: Then I want to, as my bonus action--

01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:12.072
MATT: By the way, by going unconscious, you lost
your Hunter's Mark.

01:52:12.072 --> 01:52:31.320
LAURA: Of course I did. As my bonus action, I'm
going to take-- I don't know. I have a bag of gems

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:40.391
of my own. I'm going to pull out from my thing,
and toss it at the efreet, and say, we're more

01:52:40.391 --> 01:52:43.970
than we look, and we need your help. Hope that it
bribes him.

01:52:43.970 --> 01:52:46.458
MATT: Okay, make a persuasion roll.

01:52:46.458 --> 01:52:50.362
SAM: Mid-battle bribery!

01:52:50.362 --> 01:53:01.628
LAURA: Persuasion, persuasion. 21.

01:53:01.628 --> 01:53:08.271
MATT: You toss the gems, they scatter across the
ground in front of this efreeti, holding its

01:53:08.271 --> 01:53:15.871
weapon to the side. He just snarls. All right,
that ends your turn? Unless you want to move from

01:53:15.871 --> 01:53:19.490
your current position. You have half your movement
now, so you can move 15 feet.

01:53:19.490 --> 01:53:27.268
LAURA: I'm going to move-- Is it stupid to move
into the mansion?

01:53:27.268 --> 01:53:28.441
TRAVIS: No.

01:53:28.441 --> 01:53:29.860
LAURA: I'm going to move into the mansion.

01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:31.971
MATT: Okay, you move into the mansion.

01:53:31.971 --> 01:53:33.782
SAM: Thanks for abandoning us!

01:53:33.782 --> 01:53:36.564
MATT: All righty, that ends Vex's turn. Keyleth,
you're up.

01:53:36.564 --> 01:53:41.117
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to Sunbeam him again.

01:53:41.117 --> 01:53:49.074
MATT: Okay, so saving throw. That would be 24.

01:53:49.074 --> 01:53:59.782
SAM: So we all saw Vex wake up, throw a bag of
money, and walk into my house. Very unusual. With

01:53:59.782 --> 01:54:02.561
a broom dragging behind her.

01:54:02.561 --> 01:54:09.481
LAURA: Trinket's going to run and stand next to
Pike, to protect her.

01:54:09.481 --> 01:54:11.142
MATT: All righty.

01:54:11.142 --> 01:54:15.925
MARISHA: I'm going to use my bonus action to turn
into an air elemental.

01:54:15.925 --> 01:54:18.610
MATT: Well, how much damage does it deal? It still
takes half damage.

01:54:18.610 --> 01:54:24.520
MARISHA: Right. Just a game of attrition, at this
point.

01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:34.314
SAM: Oh boy, guys, this is a fight.

01:54:34.314 --> 01:55:02.644
MARISHA: Hang on, sorry, trying to do math.
(adding) 33 divided in half, so, shit. 11! No, 12!

01:55:02.644 --> 01:55:05.760
33? 16!

01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:08.395
MATT: 16 points of radiant damage.

01:55:08.395 --> 01:55:09.501
MARISHA: I'm really nervous!

01:55:09.501 --> 01:55:11.452
MATT: You drop the poison.
When you go into your air elemental form, as your

01:55:11.452 --> 01:55:13.799
bonus action, the poison is cast out of your form.
So you're no longer poisoned.

01:55:13.799 --> 01:55:25.854
MARISHA: I still have movement, right?

01:55:25.854 --> 01:55:32.355
MATT: Yes. Real fast, just to make sure, I keep
forgetting. The Sunbeam you had, and you took a

01:55:32.355 --> 01:55:36.004
bunch of hits from the erinyes? The damage you
took from the erinyes. I need you to roll three

01:55:36.004 --> 01:55:40.622
constitution saving throws. I need to remember to
do this. It's a lot to remember, guys. My

01:55:40.622 --> 01:55:42.000
apologies.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.265
TRAVIS: As a result of the--

01:55:44.265 --> 01:55:46.831
MATT: Damage that she took from the arrows,
earlier.

01:55:46.831 --> 01:55:56.539
MARISHA: That's 18 for the first one. Ooh, not
good. Not good at all. Seven.

01:55:56.539 --> 01:56:01.266
MATT: All right, so in theory the Sunbeam would
already have gone away before--

01:56:01.266 --> 01:56:03.700
MARISHA: Can I use inspiration on that?

01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:04.880
SAM: 12.

01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:08.806
MARISHA: Plus 12? Another seven! So 14!

01:56:08.806 --> 01:56:13.098
MATT: 14? That's fine.

01:56:13.098 --> 01:56:20.198
MARISHA: Okay, and then last one, last one. 13.

01:56:20.198 --> 01:56:23.972
MATT: What was the damage you took from the third
arrow?

01:56:23.972 --> 01:56:27.404
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:56:27.404 --> 01:56:29.220
MATT: Did you write down the damage you took?

01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:32.639
MARISHA: I did, I took it as I went, and then I
erased it.

01:56:32.639 --> 01:56:40.243
MATT: Okay, I'll say, I don't think any attack did
more than 26 to you-- It's my own fault for

01:56:40.243 --> 01:56:48.535
forgetting. It's fine. So you maintain your
Sunbeam. We're good. All righty, so. You turn into an

01:56:48.535 --> 01:56:50.803
air elemental. Do you want to move or stay where
you are?

01:56:50.803 --> 01:56:55.531
MARSIAH: Yeah, I want to start heading up,
gliding. I have a fly speed of 90, right? Can I

01:56:55.531 --> 01:56:56.768
get up to her?

01:56:56.768 --> 01:57:04.368
MATT: You can. There you go. That ends your turn.
All righty, Grog.

01:57:04.368 --> 01:57:16.167
TRAVIS: Why does no one want to stay and play with
me?! Can I step up on the ledge, like an assassin

01:57:16.167 --> 01:57:23.066
from Assassin's Creed, attach the Chain of
Returning to my axe, and throw it at the back of

01:57:23.066 --> 01:57:24.618
the pit fiend?

01:57:24.618 --> 01:57:26.986
MATT: Totally. Go for it.

01:57:26.986 --> 01:57:30.784
TRAVIS: Reckless! But not great weapon master.

01:57:30.784 --> 01:57:32.398
MATT: Right.

01:57:32.398 --> 01:57:40.109
TRAVIS: 24.

01:57:40.109 --> 01:57:49.642
MATT: All right. That hits. Go ahead and roll
damage on that.

01:57:49.642 --> 01:58:01.482
TRAVIS: Right. Four points of necrotic, 28. Oh,
plus I'm enlarged. 29.

01:58:01.482 --> 01:58:08.141
MATT: 29 points of damage. The axe jams and embeds
itself into the back. The pit fiend is like

01:58:08.141 --> 01:58:14.998
(snarling). The voice once again emanates from its
telepathic push into your respective brains in the

01:58:14.998 --> 01:58:22.768
vicinity. "You have angered the city guard. You
have no victory now."

01:58:22.768 --> 01:58:29.615
TRAVIS: Well, I'm not going to do any good up
here. I still have my movement, right? I'm going to try

01:58:29.615 --> 01:58:35.580
some stupid shit. Since the axe is in his back,
can I Indiana Jones down to the ground?

01:58:35.580 --> 01:58:42.496
(singing Indiana Jones theme song)

01:58:42.496 --> 01:58:48.371
Just, (yelling) trying to get down to the ground
or underneath him. I may hit the ground, but maybe

01:58:48.371 --> 01:58:49.740
it will be slowed by the--?

01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:52.795
MATT: I need you to roll an acrobatics check to
land this.

01:58:52.795 --> 01:58:54.198
TRAVIS: I understand.

01:58:54.198 --> 01:59:01.014
MATT: You are heavy, and the chain itself is going
to come loose as you come down, so roll an

01:59:01.014 --> 01:59:03.079
acrobatics check.

01:59:03.079 --> 01:59:07.758
TRAVIS: Not great. Nine.

01:59:07.758 --> 01:59:18.012
MATT: You swing, and you land. You stumble. You
roll and land straight into the lava.

01:59:18.012 --> 01:59:22.202
TRAVIS: (yells)

01:59:22.202 --> 01:59:26.632
MARISHA: Holy shit!

01:59:26.632 --> 01:59:28.217
MATT: Okay.

01:59:28.217 --> 01:59:36.141
LIAM: Think of the burn scars. You'll look so
cool.

01:59:36.141 --> 01:59:39.519
LAURA: Oh no, why is he looking at something?

01:59:39.519 --> 01:59:43.075
MATT: I'm going to check one thing in here, real
fast. There actually is, as I found out later on,

01:59:43.075 --> 01:59:49.655
there is a rule for lava damage. I want to make
sure.

01:59:49.655 --> 01:59:58.111
SAM: Guys, why did we come to the fire plane?

01:59:58.111 --> 02:00:02.721
LAURA: Because we need that Dawnmartyr!

02:00:02.721 --> 02:00:09.372
TRAVIS: It's not like an embankment down to the
lava, right? It's just a river of lava, right?

02:00:09.372 --> 02:00:12.954
SAM: Maybe the lava is a secret passage! Grog, you
should swim down and find out!

02:00:12.954 --> 02:00:15.615
TRAVIS: It's like a hidden Mario level!

02:00:15.615 --> 02:00:21.103
MATT: Sorry, I'm looking this up now.

02:00:21.103 --> 02:00:26.224
SAM: Guys, should I read another limerick while
he's doing this?

02:00:26.224 --> 02:00:28.827
LAURA: I mean, it was so lovely the last time.

02:00:28.827 --> 02:00:34.336
TALIESIN: You know, there are actually chapters
by--

02:00:34.336 --> 02:00:40.402
TRAVIS: That's bad? I'm just going to do the T2 as
I sink into the lava.

02:00:40.402 --> 02:00:44.073
MATT: I'm going to go ahead and use a dice roller
on this one.

02:00:44.073 --> 02:00:47.603
LAURA: Because it's that many dice?

02:00:47.603 --> 02:00:50.417
MARISHA: Oh, jeez!

02:00:50.417 --> 02:00:55.536
TRAVIS: I mean, I stood in lava before, with Gern.
It didn't hurt that much.

02:00:55.536 --> 02:01:02.810
LAURA: Yeah, it didn't, but this is different than
the lava we've been in before?

02:01:02.810 --> 02:01:08.175
MATT: This is in the Plane of Fire, and this is
the real rules for lava damage, as opposed to

02:01:08.175 --> 02:01:13.352
mine, made up earlier and not fully considering
the complications. So you suffer 63 points of fire

02:01:13.352 --> 02:01:14.812
damage, Grog.

02:01:14.812 --> 02:01:16.557
TRAVIS: 63, thank you.

02:01:16.557 --> 02:01:31.842
MATT: As you are currently Terminator-ing it into
the lava right now. So that ends your turn? Vax,

02:01:31.842 --> 02:01:32.836
you're up.

02:01:32.836 --> 02:01:36.370
LIAM: All right, I figure I can see Keyleth and
the winged lady, so I'm going to beeline right to

02:01:36.370 --> 02:01:40.672
the other side of the enemy and flank her.

02:01:40.672 --> 02:01:41.727
MATT: Over here?

02:01:41.727 --> 02:01:48.774
LIAm: Yeah, up to the wall. (impact) Dagger dagger
dagger. So flanking, advantage. First attack is a

02:01:48.774 --> 02:01:50.419
26.

02:01:50.419 --> 02:01:52.250
MATT: 26 hits.

02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:54.806
LIAM: Second attack is a 19.

02:01:54.806 --> 02:01:59.897
MATT: She's going to pull her longsword out and
parry to the side. The second attack does not hit.

02:01:59.897 --> 02:02:02.661
LIAM: How does that work? She automatically does
it?

02:02:02.661 --> 02:02:04.684
MATT: She adds a plus four to her AC.

02:02:04.684 --> 02:02:13.436
LIAM: Plus four? I'm going to use, nah. Okay. Then
the third attack is a 32.

02:02:13.436 --> 02:02:14.913
MATT: Okay.

02:02:14.913 --> 02:02:33.233
LIAM: Okay, so first and third. The first one gets
the sneak attack. So that is (adding) 29, plus

02:02:33.233 --> 02:02:39.901
the psychic damage, gets 32. That's the one that
sneak attacks. Then the other one, the regular

02:02:39.901 --> 02:02:50.157
one, where'd my pyramid go? Gets a ten. So a
total of 42 between the two attacks.

02:02:50.157 --> 02:02:55.247
MATT: Oof, nice. So, as you dart up around and
land to the side, as you jam the blade into her

02:02:55.247 --> 02:03:02.036
side, she gasps out and you can feel the strange,
burning warmth of her blood on your hand. She's

02:03:02.036 --> 02:03:15.405
not doing too well. All right, that ends your
turn? All right, Percy.

02:03:15.405 --> 02:03:22.905
LIAM: Shoot to kill, baby. Do it, golden snitch.

02:03:22.905 --> 02:03:32.552
TALIESIN: Oh boy, okay. Oh, this is so bad. All
right.

02:03:32.552 --> 02:03:42.402
MATT: In your visual range right now, you have the
pit fiend up in the air, you have the efreeti that

02:03:42.402 --> 02:03:47.231
just arrived, that is currently assessing the
situation and is not favorable in your path right now.

02:03:47.231 --> 02:03:56.463
SAM: He passes, again.

02:03:56.463 --> 02:04:07.617
TALIESIN: This is such a phenomenally interesting
disaster. No, okay, I've got some plans. I'm going to--

02:04:07.617 --> 02:04:11.859
SAM: I'm going to construct a small lever system.

02:04:11.859 --> 02:04:25.103
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to try and get him to
drop his, ah, fuck. Yeah, fuck it, I'm going to

02:04:25.103 --> 02:04:26.642
get him to drop his mace.

02:04:26.642 --> 02:04:32.080
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's a good move. That mace sucks
all the balls.

02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:40.672
TALIESIN: So I'm taking that shot with
sharpshooter. Actually, no, you know what? No,

02:04:40.672 --> 02:04:47.067
just straight, clean. Yeah, that'll do. 24.

02:04:47.067 --> 02:04:51.351
MATT: 24 hits. Strength save to try and--?

02:04:51.351 --> 02:04:54.568
TALIESIN: That's a strength save against, I
believe, 18.

02:04:54.568 --> 02:04:56.568
MATT: That's a 27.

02:04:56.568 --> 02:05:05.692
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, I don't even know why I
bothered. But at the very least, that is ten

02:05:05.692 --> 02:05:09.102
regular points of damage, two psychic damage, and
six necrotic damage.

02:05:09.102 --> 02:05:10.696
MATT: Okay.

02:05:10.696 --> 02:05:23.973
TALIESIN: I'm going to, yeah, I'm going to hold
off on that for a little bit.

02:05:23.973 --> 02:05:31.709
LAURA: Loot Crate!

02:05:31.709 --> 02:05:38.822
TALIESIN: I'm so horrified by this entire-- I'm
going to take another shot at him, straight, with

02:05:38.822 --> 02:05:49.613
sharpshooter. Nope, that goes really, really
poorly. That misfires, and I take, ooh, yeah, no.

02:05:49.613 --> 02:06:06.072
This may work. Okay. I take six points of psychic
damage. So I take six points of psychic damage,

02:06:06.072 --> 02:06:19.452
and I scream, they're mad, I'm mad, we're all mad!
It's driving us mad! Help us! Help us all! And I

02:06:19.452 --> 02:06:27.375
scream, holding my head and running into the door.
Seeing if I can fake out the djinn to thinking

02:06:27.375 --> 02:06:29.940
that maybe things are a little complicated.

02:06:29.940 --> 02:06:35.122
MATT: All right, make a deception check.

02:06:35.122 --> 02:06:39.067
TALIESIN: Do I get advantage on that?

02:06:39.067 --> 02:06:40.055
MATT: No.

02:06:40.055 --> 02:06:46.524
TALISIN: God damn it. Okay, that'll do. 19.

02:06:46.524 --> 02:07:00.006
MATT: Okay. As you come charging through the
doorway, you guys watch as Percy's form disappears

02:07:00.006 --> 02:07:09.141
into the space, which is immediately followed by a
heavy slamming sound as the pit fiend, like a

02:07:09.141 --> 02:07:19.306
Keyteor, drops right there, on the ground, right
next to Pike and Scanlan. It shouts over its

02:07:19.306 --> 02:07:32.033
shoulder, "Call your men!" as it emanates from its
psychic wave of telekinetic speech, "Call your

02:07:32.033 --> 02:07:40.181
"men! I need aid." Going to unload on the beacon of
divinity that stands before it, that has healed--

02:07:40.181 --> 02:07:43.236
SAM: Unless it is trapped in my sphere.

02:07:43.236 --> 02:07:51.706
MATT: So, as it moves into the space, what's the
save on that again?

02:07:51.706 --> 02:07:59.878
SAM: 21 if I'm using my cone, which was up for my
last one. I did not Cutting Words on this one, so

02:07:59.878 --> 02:08:01.375
he's got advantage.

02:08:01.375 --> 02:08:16.451
MATT: That is a 22. Plus eight to his dex saving
throw there. He has resistance. He slams onto the

02:08:16.451 --> 02:08:17.794
ground.

02:08:17.794 --> 02:08:24.555
ASHLEY: I'm going to wave at him.

02:08:24.555 --> 02:08:33.780
MATT: As you wave at him, Pike, he makes his claw
attack against you. That is a 19 plus, that's a 34

02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:34.810
to hit.

02:08:34.810 --> 02:08:35.997
LIAM: Does that hit, Ashley?

02:08:35.997 --> 02:08:37.453
ASHLEY: No! It doesn't hit!

02:08:37.453 --> 02:08:40.037
(laughter)

02:08:40.037 --> 02:08:50.693
MATT: So that is 20 points of slashing damage,
Ashley. It's going to attempt to bite you. It's a

02:08:50.693 --> 02:09:10.687
natural 20 on the bite. That's not good, at all.
That is 40 points of piercing damage, Ashley, and

02:09:10.687 --> 02:09:13.223
I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

02:09:13.223 --> 02:09:15.949
LIAM: Matthew Mercer, keeping us humble since
2013.

02:09:15.949 --> 02:09:20.520
LAURA: He's really enjoying himself. TPK tonight,
guys.

02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:25.958
ASHLEY: Oh, boy, that's bad. I got an eight.

02:09:25.958 --> 02:09:44.372
MATT: All right, so you also suffer, as the poison
courses through your body, that is 25 points of

02:09:44.372 --> 02:09:55.517
piercing damage. I'm not going to double that,
because technically it's not the attack, it's the

02:09:55.517 --> 02:09:59.708
poison that hurt you. The poison isn't critical.
That's a gift.

02:09:59.708 --> 02:10:04.345
LIAM: It's pronounced "jift."

02:10:04.345 --> 02:10:12.380
MATT: Now it's going to swing with its tail
action. That is a 20 to hit.

02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:15.695
SAM: I'm going to Cutting Words that, with my
reaction.

02:10:15.695 --> 02:10:20.413
ASHLEY: My armor class is 20. Unless, there were
no aids with that--?

02:10:20.413 --> 02:10:22.795
MATT: Well, hold on. You're going to Cutting
Words?

02:10:22.795 --> 02:10:30.405
SAM: That's a hit? So I'm going to Cutting Words
that. I'm going to sing, (singing) Your evilness

02:10:30.405 --> 02:10:41.585
is killing me, and I must confess, I want to flee!
But when you see me you lose your mind, baby it's

02:10:41.585 --> 02:10:46.868
a sign! Pit fiend, baby, now you're mine!

02:10:46.868 --> 02:10:50.023
LIAM: That was strong!

02:10:50.023 --> 02:10:54.232
MATT: Roll that d12, man! You earned that shit!

02:10:54.232 --> 02:10:57.586
SAM: Three.

02:10:57.586 --> 02:11:03.320
MATT: That's enough! So, the tail sweeps over to
try and smash Pike. As you start singing, the

02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:10.779
tail, halfway through, stops, and it looks at you.
Then continues the swing, but that's just enough

02:11:10.779 --> 02:11:14.499
for Pike to dodge out of the way, as it cracks
into the stonework. However, it then backswings

02:11:14.499 --> 02:11:24.887
with its mace toward you with its final attack,
Pike. That is a 22 to hit. So you suffer 15 points

02:11:24.887 --> 02:11:29.495
of bludgeoning damage, plus--

02:11:29.495 --> 02:11:32.194
ASHLEY: I'm unconscious, I'm unconscious.

02:11:32.194 --> 02:11:38.528
MATT: You're unconscious? Well, that would have
been an additional 24 points of fire damage. So

02:11:38.528 --> 02:11:52.640
Pike is poisoned and unconscious. Scanlan, you
feel the blade at your side begin to vibrate at

02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:57.599
the end of your song. The Mythcarver that's been
sitting there, it begins to shake and quiver at

02:11:57.599 --> 02:12:07.755
your side. The erinyes is against you now, it's
its turn. Throws the bow to the side, on the

02:12:07.755 --> 02:12:11.599
ground. Pulls its longsword out and is going to
go three attacks against you, having jammed your

02:12:11.599 --> 02:12:12.902
blade into its side.

02:12:12.902 --> 02:12:14.513
LIAM: Yes, Uncanny Dodge.

02:12:14.513 --> 02:12:17.426
MATT: First one is going to be a 19?

02:12:17.426 --> 02:12:19.665
LIAM: Does not hit.

02:12:19.665 --> 02:12:25.077
MATT: That is a 13. Last hit is a 24.

02:12:25.077 --> 02:12:29.620
LIAM: I will use a second luck to make her roll
again.

02:12:29.620 --> 02:12:33.115
MATT: That is even better. That is a 25.

02:12:33.115 --> 02:12:35.126
LIAM: All right, Uncanny Dodge.

02:12:35.126 --> 02:12:42.199
MATT: So you take the hit for the longsword.
That is five plus four, it's nine points of

02:12:42.199 --> 02:12:53.221
slashing damage. Actually, sorry, that would be
plus more-- Nine points of slashing damage, plus

02:12:53.221 --> 02:12:58.763
you take 20 points of poison damage.

02:12:58.763 --> 02:13:02.085
LIAM: So the poison's full, but the swipe is
halved?

02:13:02.085 --> 02:13:04.987
MATT: Technically, it's all in one strike, so the
whole attack would be halved.

02:13:04.987 --> 02:13:07.545
LIAM: So it was nine plus what? 20?

02:13:07.545 --> 02:13:16.239
MATT: Nine plus 20. You take 14 points of damage.
There you go. All right, Scanlan, it's your turn.

02:13:16.239 --> 02:13:31.057
SAM: Fuck. I'm going to draw Mythcarver and look
at it. Admire it for a moment. Turn to Pike, who's

02:13:31.057 --> 02:13:35.935
right next to me, and Healing Words her with just
a simple touch. Can I demonstrate on you,

02:13:35.935 --> 02:13:41.181
Taliesin? I'm going to do this. Just that.

02:13:41.181 --> 02:13:46.061
TALIESIN: It was actually rather pleasant, I have
to admit it. You have very soft hands.

02:13:46.061 --> 02:13:55.815
SAM: They've never worked a day in their life. Ten
points of healing to Pikey.

02:13:55.815 --> 02:14:03.478
MATT: Okay, as you sing, Pike, you do not heal
anything. Pike remains unconscious, bleeding. The

02:14:03.478 --> 02:14:05.010
healing does not make its way through.

02:14:05.010 --> 02:14:06.700
LAURA: She's poisoned!

02:14:06.700 --> 02:14:09.934
ASHLEY: Oh god, sorry, that was so wasteful.

02:14:09.934 --> 02:14:15.929
MATT: But anyway, what are you doing? You don't
notice this. You sing to her, finish your verse,

02:14:15.929 --> 02:14:17.794
what are you doing?

02:14:17.794 --> 02:14:27.803
SAM: But that changes things! Fuck, I stick to the
plan. Hand Cone up. I'm going to try and Dominate

02:14:27.803 --> 02:14:31.149
what's-his-butt. The pit fiend.

02:14:31.149 --> 02:14:37.201
MATT: All righty. Dominate Monster?

02:14:37.201 --> 02:14:47.119
SAM: Yes. It's at disadvantage, so it's a straight
roll, but I know it's going to be pretty tough.

02:14:47.119 --> 02:14:49.399
It's a wisdom save.

02:14:49.399 --> 02:14:59.206
MATT: Wisdom saving throw. So that would be 23. 13
plus ten, he would've had disadvantage but he has

02:14:59.206 --> 02:15:01.782
advantage against spell saves, so it comes to a
single roll.

02:15:01.782 --> 02:15:03.478
SAM: Damn it, nothing's working.

02:15:03.478 --> 02:15:09.404
MARISHA: He has advantage against spells! Magic
casters have been useless.

02:15:09.404 --> 02:15:12.309
SAM: Pike is dead--

02:15:12.309 --> 02:15:14.149
LAURA: Unconscious.

02:15:14.149 --> 02:15:15.890
SAM: Yeah, but I can't leave her.

02:15:15.890 --> 02:15:24.982
LAURA: But if you move her, you'll get an attack
of opportunity on her.

02:15:24.982 --> 02:15:33.803
SAM: The thing is, I've made a promise to stay
alive. So I'm going to run away.

02:15:33.803 --> 02:15:37.832
MATT: Okay, which way are you going?

02:15:37.832 --> 02:15:39.325
SAM: Toward the mansion.

02:15:39.325 --> 02:15:43.040
MATT: Okay, so as you move toward the mansion, you
go through to the lighted doorway. It gets an

02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:44.799
attack of opportunity on you, Scanlan.

02:15:44.799 --> 02:15:45.813
SAM: Sure.

02:15:45.813 --> 02:15:49.164
MATT: It's going to make its bite attack. That is
a 21 to hit.

02:15:49.164 --> 02:15:50.405
SAM: Oh, sure.

02:15:50.405 --> 02:16:01.546
MATT: All right. You suffer 20 points of piercing
damage. I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

02:16:01.546 --> 02:16:05.974
SAM: That's not good.

02:16:05.974 --> 02:16:07.943
LAURA: God, that Heroes' Feast, man. That would've
been clutch.

02:16:07.943 --> 02:16:09.238
MARISHA: That would have been so great.

02:16:09.238 --> 02:16:10.246
SAM: 21.

02:16:10.246 --> 02:16:17.293
MATT: 21. You just succeed in shrugging the poison
off, as it bites out at you and the teeth claw

02:16:17.293 --> 02:16:21.080
against your shoulder as you run past, scooting
around the way to where the entrance to the

02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:26.358
mansion is. You're still feeling the blade
vibrating at your side. It's almost like a pulse,

02:16:26.358 --> 02:16:33.161
like it's trying to fight to be free. So you rush
around. You get to this side.

02:16:33.161 --> 02:16:36.739
SAM: I don't want to go in the mansion. I want to
stay outside. I'm going to go back to my barrel,

02:16:36.739 --> 02:16:41.581
around where Taliesin was before. Hide back there.
Yeah.

02:16:41.581 --> 02:16:47.151
MATT: Okay, there you go. That ends your turn,
Scanlan? Pike, I need you to make a death saving throw.

02:16:47.151 --> 02:16:56.595
ASHLEY: Okay, well, let's see. 1d8 plus one?

02:16:56.595 --> 02:16:58.749
LAURA: No, just roll a d20.

02:16:58.749 --> 02:17:01.399
ASHLEY: I don't know what to do. I don't think
I've done this before.

02:17:01.399 --> 02:17:03.104
LIAM: Ten or higher.

02:17:03.104 --> 02:17:05.732
ASHLEY: That was a five.

02:17:05.732 --> 02:17:12.548
MATT: Okay, so that's a failure. You also take a
pulse of the poison damage in your body, so you

02:17:12.548 --> 02:17:14.501
fail another death saving throw.

02:17:14.501 --> 02:17:16.045
TALIESIN: Fix right now.

02:17:16.045 --> 02:17:17.661
LAURA: We've got to heal her!

02:17:17.661 --> 02:17:26.953
MARISHA: Who's close to her? Do you still have any
spells left? The poison spell?

02:17:26.953 --> 02:17:28.448
LAURA: I do, I have the poison spell--

02:17:28.448 --> 02:17:29.737
SAM: You're in the mansion.

02:17:29.737 --> 02:17:31.314
LAURA: Okay, I'm first out. So, yeah, but I can
run out.

02:17:31.314 --> 02:17:32.713
MARISHA: Can you drag her in?

02:17:32.713 --> 02:17:36.129
LAURA: No, he can't move her! He'll get an attack
of opportunity on Pike!

02:17:36.129 --> 02:17:37.991
TALIESIN: No, he's already burned his attack of
opportunity.

02:17:37.991 --> 02:17:39.802
MARISHA: Yeah, trying to get Scanlan.

02:17:39.802 --> 02:17:50.556
MATT: The efreeti, now, watching you now attack
and go after this fiend, pulls its blade out and

02:17:50.556 --> 02:17:52.377
rushes toward you, Scanlan.

02:17:52.377 --> 02:17:54.470
LAURA: Guess those jewels didn't do shit.

02:17:54.470 --> 02:18:00.971
LIAM: You can keep the jewels, though. Stanky
jewels.

02:18:00.971 --> 02:18:06.579
MATT: He's heading toward you. "Halt! In the name
of the Sultan!" Takes its blade out, and it's

02:18:06.579 --> 02:18:08.874
going to make two scimitar attacks against you,
Scanlan.

02:18:08.874 --> 02:18:15.340
SAM: I do this and say, you wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses, would you?

02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:20.223
TALIESIN: Oh, yes they would.

02:18:20.223 --> 02:18:22.462
MATT: Actually, he's not going to move toward you.
He's going to stay back there, on top of the

02:18:22.462 --> 02:18:27.509
bridge, and he's going to hurl two balls of flame
at you.

02:18:27.509 --> 02:18:29.749
SAM: Why, why!

02:18:29.749 --> 02:18:32.837
MATT: That is going to be a 21 to hit.

02:18:32.837 --> 02:18:33.999
SAM: I mean, yeah.

02:18:33.999 --> 02:18:36.652
MATT: And a ten to hit.

02:18:36.652 --> 02:18:38.040
SAM: No!

02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:41.438
MATT: So the second one misses you and blasts in
the ground next to you, but the first one does--

02:18:41.438 --> 02:18:43.661
TALIESIN: Something missed! It's so nice.

02:18:43.661 --> 02:18:49.417
MATT: That is 13 points of fire damage to you,
Scanlan, as the fireball blasts against your chest.

02:18:49.417 --> 02:18:53.304
SAM: Matches my beard, now.

02:18:53.304 --> 02:18:56.571
MARISHA: Yeah, it just made you look real cool.

02:18:56.571 --> 02:19:00.328
MATT: All righty, that brings us to the top. Vex.

02:19:00.328 --> 02:19:06.041
LAURA: I mean, the thing is-- I'll come out,
obviously. I'm going to come out of the mansion.

02:19:06.041 --> 02:19:12.103
And I'll immediately see Pike.

02:19:12.103 --> 02:19:14.206
MATT: You see Pike, unconscious, on the ground.

02:19:14.206 --> 02:19:19.723
LAURA: I mean, she's right under the demon.

02:19:19.723 --> 02:19:23.217
ASHLEY: Don't, it's dangerous!

02:19:23.217 --> 02:19:25.604
MARISHA: You will die!

02:19:25.604 --> 02:19:38.675
TALIESIN: As far as I know, its reaction, its
single reaction--

02:19:38.675 --> 02:19:48.887
LAURA: I'm going to-- it's not going to work. I'm
going to try to distract him with Trinket, so I'm

02:19:48.887 --> 02:19:53.539
going to have Trinket attack him as I run in and
cast Protection from Poison on Pike.

02:19:53.539 --> 02:20:00.129
MATT: Okay. As you rush forward to cast your
spell, I will say, make an intelligence check.

02:20:00.129 --> 02:20:05.780
LAURA: Oh, because yeah, fuck. I was in the
mansion. What's going on? Can I say that?

02:20:05.780 --> 02:20:12.106
TALIESIN: We've probably, I imagine, been
narrating an awful lot of what's going on through

02:20:12.106 --> 02:20:14.451
the headpiece. Well, maybe not.

02:20:14.451 --> 02:20:16.557
SAM: Those don't reach into the mansion.

02:20:16.557 --> 02:20:18.164
LAURA: I can just see that Pike's unconscious.

02:20:18.164 --> 02:20:19.977
MATT: You see that Pike's unconscious. What'd you
roll?

02:20:19.977 --> 02:20:22.934
LAURA: I rolled a, oh, just intelligence? Five.

02:20:22.934 --> 02:20:28.598
MATT: So yeah, you have no idea that she's
poisoned. You just see her unconscious on the ground.

02:20:28.598 --> 02:20:33.968
LAURA: So I can't even cast that on her.

02:20:33.968 --> 02:20:36.165
MATT: I mean, you wouldn't know to.

02:20:36.165 --> 02:20:41.065
TALIESIN: I was going to say, she was yelling--
Well, fuck.

02:20:41.065 --> 02:20:48.240
MATT: She wouldn't have heard you, she was in the
mansion. Downside of using it as a defense

02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:49.476
mechanism.

02:20:49.476 --> 02:20:50.791
LAURA: Right.

02:20:50.791 --> 02:20:54.160
MATT: You're up next, Keyleth.

02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:57.593
LAURA: Does Lesser Restoration heal at all?

02:20:57.593 --> 02:20:59.698
MATT: No.

02:20:59.698 --> 02:21:07.096
MARISHA: It doesn't heal, but it should fix
poison.

02:21:07.096 --> 02:21:09.428
MATT: If she knew there was poison.

02:21:09.428 --> 02:21:14.624
LAURA: I don't know that she's poisoned. All
right, then I'm going to waste my turn completely

02:21:14.624 --> 02:21:18.326
and try to cast Cure Wounds on her, because that's
all I fucking--

02:21:18.326 --> 02:21:22.267
MATT: As you rush forward, Trinket distracting,
are you using your bonus action to have Trinket

02:21:22.267 --> 02:21:26.762
attack? So go ahead and roll the attack with
Trinket. You rush forward and put your hands onto

02:21:26.762 --> 02:21:31.563
Pike, desperately trying to heal her. As the
energy pulses through her body, no effect. All you

02:21:31.563 --> 02:21:40.495
see is the wound from the bite of the fiend in her
neck, and you see the dark veins curling up. Now

02:21:40.495 --> 02:21:42.875
you know, at that proximity, that it's poison.

02:21:42.875 --> 02:21:46.371
LAURA: I couldn't have run up and looked at her,
to know it was poison? To see the black around her

02:21:46.371 --> 02:22:02.142
fucking--? Cool. 27 for the attack on Trinket, and
then that is a 14, no, that's a lie. 11.

02:22:02.142 --> 02:22:07.812
MATT: All right. Good to know.

02:22:07.812 --> 02:22:10.838
LAURA: If I move, I'll get attacked.

02:22:10.838 --> 02:22:12.232
MATT: Yes, you will.

02:22:12.232 --> 02:22:14.103
LAURA: I'm going to die.

02:22:14.103 --> 02:22:15.475
MATT: Keyleth, your turn.

02:22:15.475 --> 02:22:18.578
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to Sunbeam She-Ra
right in the face.

02:22:18.578 --> 02:22:26.274
TRAVIS: I love that that's her unofficial name.
Announce yourself, woman! Thing! Whatever!

02:22:26.274 --> 02:22:35.631
MARISHA: Just say, I'm sorry, what's your name?

02:22:35.631 --> 02:22:37.987
MATT: From this perspective, you will hit him with
your Sunbeam.

02:22:37.987 --> 02:22:40.386
MARISHA: Well, I can fly, so can I scooch around?

02:22:40.386 --> 02:22:44.651
MATT: You can move around this direction, try and
do it there. So burst that way. Just wanted to

02:22:44.651 --> 02:22:51.765
make sure you're aware of-- All right. Rolled two
threes in a row. Does not save.

02:22:51.765 --> 02:23:01.703
MARISHA: That's right! For once! All right. So,
she's blind, that's the cool part. That's a good

02:23:01.703 --> 02:23:19.447
roll! Okay, that's 14 plus seven, which is 21.
(adding) 29. No, no! 27 plus four is 21.

02:23:19.447 --> 02:23:23.542
MATT: Okay, so as you dart around the side of the
erinyes, you see her bloodied--

02:23:23.542 --> 02:23:25.382
MARISHA: 31.

02:23:25.382 --> 02:23:33.147
MATT: --begins hacking at Vax, right next to you.
You rush around, your hands glow. This beam of sun

02:23:33.147 --> 02:23:38.279
energy bursts out. You hear the screaming echo as
her body is turned to ash within her armor,

02:23:38.279 --> 02:23:42.930
causing the armor to clank to the ground, the rope
at her side scattering to the ground as well. She

02:23:42.930 --> 02:23:45.039
has been destroyed.

02:23:45.039 --> 02:23:49.604
MARISHA: Something. It's a hollow victory.

02:23:49.604 --> 02:23:51.468
LAURA: Good job, good job.

02:23:51.468 --> 02:23:53.265
MARISHA: Do I still have any more movement?

02:23:53.265 --> 02:23:58.451
MATT: You do. You've moved five feet, so you still
have--

02:23:58.451 --> 02:24:00.458
MARISHA: 85 flying speed.

02:24:00.458 --> 02:24:04.564
LIAM: I got Pike.

02:24:04.564 --> 02:24:14.781
MARISHA: You've got Pike. I want to, can I make it
to Big Pharma? I don't remember any of their

02:24:14.781 --> 02:24:18.389
names. I'm just using the nicknames we've come up
with. Ghurrix.

02:24:18.389 --> 02:24:27.521
MATT: Yeah, you can get up next to him, if you
want to. You want to get up next to him? There?

02:24:27.521 --> 02:24:30.269
MARISHA: Yeah, can I flank him a bit?

02:24:30.269 --> 02:24:33.473
MATT: You could fly over and flank him this way,
if you wanted.

02:24:33.473 --> 02:24:35.132
MARISHA: Yeah, I want to flank.

02:24:35.132 --> 02:24:37.008
SAM: Got to flank.

02:24:37.008 --> 02:24:42.185
MATT: Kind of hard to flank without stepping into
the mansion, unfortunately, because the door is

02:24:42.185 --> 02:24:43.358
right there on the flank.

02:24:43.358 --> 02:24:45.641
MARISHA: I can fly, though. I can hover. Can I
hover and flank?

02:24:45.641 --> 02:24:49.309
MATT: Not really. You have to be on the entire
opposite side from somebody else. So there's no

02:24:49.309 --> 02:24:53.747
real place you can flank here, unfortunately.

02:24:53.747 --> 02:25:00.334
SAM: It's all good. You're going to die anyway. It
doesn't matter, right? We're all going to die.

02:25:00.334 --> 02:25:07.463
MARISHA: I'll just hover there and look imposing.
I'll puff up real big.

02:25:07.463 --> 02:25:16.615
MATT: Good to know. So you are puffing up real
big. We'll say above. All right, cool. Grog.

02:25:16.615 --> 02:25:23.519
TRAVIS: Right, not that I don't love being in this
river of liquid magma, could I get out, please?

02:25:23.519 --> 02:25:29.070
MATT: Well, first you take 74 points of fire
damage from being in the lava at the start of your turn.

02:25:29.070 --> 02:25:30.636
TRAVIS: Can I use Stone's Endurance?

02:25:30.636 --> 02:25:32.646
MATT: You can.

02:25:32.646 --> 02:25:43.554
TRAVIS: 26. So what's--

02:25:43.554 --> 02:25:46.415
MATT: It'd be 48. You take 48 points of fire
damage.

02:25:46.415 --> 02:25:48.595
TRAVIS: Thank you for doing the math for me.

02:25:48.595 --> 02:25:54.780
MATT: The pain is unbearable, but you use that to
fuel your anger as you climb out, feeling the

02:25:54.780 --> 02:25:58.210
molten rock spilling off of your body. I imagine
you're going to want to move out of it.

02:25:58.210 --> 02:26:04.165
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. Toward everybody else, where
all the danger is. The fun zone. Now, I have a

02:26:04.165 --> 02:26:05.099
question.

02:26:05.099 --> 02:26:07.794
MATT: You want to flank around this way, or this
way?

02:26:07.794 --> 02:26:09.231
TRAVIS: Around this way.

02:26:09.231 --> 02:26:11.477
MATT: Okay, so you pull around to that side.

02:26:11.477 --> 02:26:17.824
TRAVIS: What I would like to try and do is, as I
get out of the magma, seeing Pike unconscious is

02:26:17.824 --> 02:26:26.913
the worst. If I try and grab her, and head for the
door, I have to go past the pit fiend. He'll get

02:26:26.913 --> 02:26:33.110
an attack of opportunity on me. If I'm cradling
her, does he get one on her as well?

02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:38.515
MATT: Generally, attack of opportunity is against
the creature that's running, so it'd probably be

02:26:38.515 --> 02:26:40.337
against you.

02:26:40.337 --> 02:26:46.308
TRAVIS: All right, I would like to pick up my
buddy Pike and make like hell for the door.

02:26:46.308 --> 02:26:51.997
MATT: Okay, so you reach down. You grab her using
your full action, pick her currently unconscious,

02:26:51.997 --> 02:26:59.190
limp form in your arm, cradling her. You see the
wound, the blood, across her. You pick her up and

02:26:59.190 --> 02:27:04.581
you go running around, into the door. As you do,
the pit fiend-- He already took his attack of

02:27:04.581 --> 02:27:10.469
opportunity earlier, so yeah, he does not get one.
So you grab Pike, and move, and disappear into the

02:27:10.469 --> 02:27:12.375
doorway with her.

02:27:12.375 --> 02:27:15.143
TRAVIS: All right. Oh, Pike!

02:27:15.143 --> 02:27:19.274
MATT: All righty. That ends your turn, Grog. Vax,
you're up.

02:27:19.274 --> 02:27:29.696
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to rocket toward the, hm.
Just give me ten seconds to think.

02:27:29.696 --> 02:27:33.924
SAM: Loot Crate, Loot Crate.

02:27:33.924 --> 02:27:36.270
MATT: Be ready, Percy.

02:27:36.270 --> 02:27:42.017
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to rocket into the door, so
I've got haste, I've got 120 feet.

02:27:42.017 --> 02:27:44.036
MATT: Okay.

02:27:44.036 --> 02:27:49.361
LIAM: So I'm going to arc into the door. If I pass
the pit demon, I'm going to use disengage as a

02:27:49.361 --> 02:27:52.236
bonus action so he does not, and I'll swivel
underneath.

02:27:52.236 --> 02:27:54.059
LAURA: He's already used his attack of
opportunity.

02:27:54.059 --> 02:27:58.945
LIAM: He has? Oh, and Vex is right next to him?
Five feet? I'm going to stab him in the fucking

02:27:58.945 --> 02:28:07.252
face as I fly in the door. 24, hits.

02:28:07.252 --> 02:28:08.876
MATT: 24 hits, yep.

02:28:08.876 --> 02:28:35.324
LIAM: Okay, so that is (adding) 41, as I fly past
into the door. Use Lay on Hands twice. There's

02:28:35.324 --> 02:28:38.847
nothing in the book that says I can only use it
once a turn. So I'm going to use the first time I

02:28:38.847 --> 02:28:46.329
use it to cast Neutralize Poison on her, and the
second time I'm going to use it to give her one

02:28:46.329 --> 02:28:51.752
hit point. It doesn't say anything in the book
about amount per turn.

02:28:51.752 --> 02:28:54.249
MATT: As an action, you touch a creature.

02:28:54.249 --> 02:28:56.314
LIAM: But I have two more actions.

02:28:56.314 --> 02:28:58.136
MATT: You used one to attack.

02:28:58.136 --> 02:28:59.819
LIAM: Can I use the bonus action to attack?

02:28:59.819 --> 02:29:05.233
MATT: You could use your haste attack to hit him
on the way through, and that can only be used as

02:29:05.233 --> 02:29:10.012
an attack anyway, because that's the nature of the
haste bonus. You can use your action to neutralize

02:29:10.012 --> 02:29:11.278
the poison.

02:29:11.278 --> 02:29:17.276
LIAM: All right, question for Matt, and I'm Liam
right now. If I bring her up ten hit points,

02:29:17.276 --> 02:29:22.520
right, poison doesn't bring her down anymore in
5e, it just puts her to disadvantage, correct?

02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:27.907
MATT: This poison, you're not quite sure. You
don't know the circumstance.

02:29:27.907 --> 02:29:32.388
LIAM: I'm going to use five points of Lay on Hands
to cure the poison.

02:29:32.388 --> 02:29:36.740
MATT: Okay, so the poison is removed from her.
That is as much as you can do.

02:29:36.740 --> 02:29:40.971
LIAM: Well, if I can only use Lay on Hands once,
I'm going to throw another dagger out the door

02:29:40.971 --> 02:29:42.605
into the pit fiend--

02:29:42.605 --> 02:29:46.243
MATT: You cannot see him from that side of the
door. The doorway is facing outward. He's on the

02:29:46.243 --> 02:29:52.138
other side of the doorway. That is the end of your
turn. Pike is no longer poisoned. The bulging

02:29:52.138 --> 02:29:58.014
black veins retract from her throat. The shallow
breath is still there, though fading. Percy.

02:29:58.014 --> 02:30:04.508
TALIESIN: I've lost my list of healing potions,
but I think I had a minor potion left.

02:30:04.508 --> 02:30:07.084
MARISHA: Are you inside?

02:30:07.084 --> 02:30:08.378
TALIESIN: I am inside.

02:30:08.378 --> 02:30:10.167
TRAVIS: I got lots of potions.

02:30:10.167 --> 02:30:13.269
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab a potion from-- I was
about to say, I know I have one, but everything

02:30:13.269 --> 02:30:18.227
got fucked. We restocked right before we went. I'm
going to feed her a potion for my move.

02:30:18.227 --> 02:30:24.660
MATT: Well, for your bonus. Well no, it would be
your action to feed her a potion. All right, so,

02:30:24.660 --> 02:30:26.510
feeding her just a basic?

02:30:26.510 --> 02:30:27.797
TALIESIN: Feeding her a basic.

02:30:27.797 --> 02:30:32.969
MATT: All righty. That is a 2d4 plus two.

02:30:32.969 --> 02:30:37.654
TALIESIN: All right. Do I still have movement?
Okay.

02:30:37.654 --> 02:30:40.526
MARISHA: Holy shit.

02:30:40.526 --> 02:30:45.166
TALIESIN: That's five.

02:30:45.166 --> 02:30:48.154
ASHLEY: I'll take it!

02:30:48.154 --> 02:30:50.184
MATT: Pike is now at five hit points and
conscious.

02:30:50.184 --> 02:30:51.898
TRAVIS: Pikey!

02:30:51.898 --> 02:30:55.225
MARISHA: Good teamwork, good teamwork!

02:30:55.225 --> 02:31:00.610
TRAVIS: (voice cracking) Don't do that to us,
Pike!

02:31:00.610 --> 02:31:04.019
MATT: Percy, that end your turn?

02:31:04.019 --> 02:31:07.873
TALIESIN: No. Weird question, how far away is Vex
from the door?

02:31:07.873 --> 02:31:13.465
MATT: Vex is roughly 15 feet.

02:31:13.465 --> 02:31:22.072
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to use half my movement
to get to Vex. If this can be done, I'm going to

02:31:22.072 --> 02:31:34.768
burn my action surge and grab her. The rest of my
movement to drag her into the hole. 15 more feet.

02:31:34.768 --> 02:31:36.007
15 and 15.

02:31:36.007 --> 02:31:38.179
MATT: 15 feet will get you inside, and get her
just outside the door.

02:31:38.179 --> 02:31:40.376
TALIESIN: That'll do.

02:31:40.376 --> 02:31:43.077
MARISHA: Pike? I thought she was already inside?

02:31:43.077 --> 02:31:45.512
LAURA: No, that was me he was doing that to.

02:31:45.512 --> 02:31:47.041
SAM: Are you unconscious, too?

02:31:47.041 --> 02:31:50.388
TALIESIN: No, she's in striking distance of the
asshole. I'm getting her out of striking distance

02:31:50.388 --> 02:31:55.566
of the asshole. Okay! That's my move.

02:31:55.566 --> 02:32:01.787
MATT: That's your move. All righty. Now it is
Ghurrix's turn. Ghurrix, who watched his summoned

02:32:01.787 --> 02:32:09.036
ally get thrown back to the Hells through the
Sunbeam that blasted over the side, looks over to

02:32:09.036 --> 02:32:16.428
the efreet that appears to be, now, on his side.
Takes a leap up (whooshing, crashing) in between

02:32:16.428 --> 02:32:21.934
Scanlan and Vex. Let's see.

02:32:21.934 --> 02:32:23.978
LIAM: Look at his eyes.

02:32:23.978 --> 02:32:25.172
MARISHA: I know.

02:32:25.172 --> 02:32:27.136
MATT: He's real angry at both of you.

02:32:27.136 --> 02:32:32.553
SAM: I haven't done &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; to him, by the way.
Not a &lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt;.

02:32:32.553 --> 02:32:34.491
MATT: You've tried twice to put him in a magic
sphere--

02:32:34.491 --> 02:32:37.206
SAM: Three times! But I've done nothing!

02:32:37.206 --> 02:32:43.409
MATT: As an intelligent creature that is very,
very familiar with high-level mind controlling--

02:32:43.409 --> 02:32:45.737
SAM: All I've done is perform for him, really.

02:32:45.737 --> 02:32:56.200
MATT: This is true. Regardless, he's going to take
a claw and a bite attack at you, Vex, and then

02:32:56.200 --> 02:32:59.825
make a mace and tail against you, Scanlan.

02:32:59.825 --> 02:33:04.244
SAM: I'm going to Cutting Words the mace attack.
Right?

02:33:04.244 --> 02:33:15.637
MATT: Well, wait till we get to it. So the claw
against you is 34, with a 19 on that. You take 18

02:33:15.637 --> 02:33:19.967
points of slashing damage from the claw. The bite
attack--

02:33:19.967 --> 02:33:21.203
LIAM: She's unconscious already!

02:33:21.203 --> 02:33:22.561
LAURA: No, I'm not!

02:33:22.561 --> 02:33:23.744
LIAM: You're about to be!

02:33:23.744 --> 02:33:25.011
MATT: That is a 25 to hit.

02:33:25.011 --> 02:33:26.253
LAURA: Okay.

02:33:26.253 --> 02:33:33.710
MATT: All right, you suffer (adding) 21 points of
piercing damage.

02:33:33.710 --> 02:33:37.181
LAURA: Motherfuck, I'm unconscious again. By one
point!

02:33:37.181 --> 02:33:38.909
MATT: I need you to make a constitution saving
throw.

02:33:38.909 --> 02:33:45.791
LAURA: For the poison? I've got resistance to
poison now, because I cast Protection from Poison

02:33:45.791 --> 02:33:46.776
on myself.

02:33:46.776 --> 02:33:48.328
MATT: Well, you're unconscious. The spell goes
away.

02:33:48.328 --> 02:33:49.837
LAURA: Aw, that's bullshit!

02:33:49.837 --> 02:33:51.014
MATT: Sorry.

02:33:51.014 --> 02:33:52.174
LAURA: God damn it.

02:33:52.174 --> 02:33:54.204
TALIESIN: Even though she was conscious when she
got bitten?

02:33:54.204 --> 02:33:58.839
MATT: The poison damage isn't what knocked her
unconscious. The bite hits, she falls unconscious,

02:33:58.839 --> 02:34:00.774
and the poison goes through her body.

02:34:00.774 --> 02:34:03.703
LAURA: It's an eight because it's a saving throw.

02:34:03.703 --> 02:34:09.212
MATT: Okay, you fail a death saving throw as the
poison courses through your body. You are now

02:34:09.212 --> 02:34:12.543
poisoned and unconscious, right outside the
mansion door.

02:34:12.543 --> 02:34:16.615
LAURA: Great. Tight.

02:34:16.615 --> 02:34:18.488
MATT: Now, for you, Scanlan.

02:34:18.488 --> 02:34:20.155
SAM: Yeah, what?

02:34:20.155 --> 02:34:23.075
MATT: The tail attack is a 20 to hit you.

02:34:23.075 --> 02:34:24.658
TALIESIN: At least we all see that.

02:34:24.658 --> 02:34:29.814
LAURA: Oh yeah, you just watched that happen right
in front of the door.

02:34:29.814 --> 02:34:33.041
TALIESIN: So we now know what to do.

02:34:33.041 --> 02:34:37.149
LIAM: I'm holding my dying friend, next to my
dying sister.

02:34:37.149 --> 02:34:40.136
MATT: 33 points of bludgeoning damage.

02:34:40.136 --> 02:34:42.787
SAM: Yep.

02:34:42.787 --> 02:34:46.278
MATT: As the tail spins and slams you to the side,
you get pushed against the wall in the corner

02:34:46.278 --> 02:34:52.584
where you've been hiding. The mace is going to
swing toward you. That is going to be a 25.

02:34:52.584 --> 02:34:59.407
SAM: Jesus, well, I'm Cutting Words-ing it, but
it's not going to do much unless I roll a lot. I'm

02:34:59.407 --> 02:35:03.112
going to Cutting Words him with a lovely
limerick.

02:35:03.112 --> 02:35:06.943
TALIESIN: Oh, fuck. All right.

02:35:06.943 --> 02:35:12.200
SAM: There was a young fellow named Brewster, who
said to his wife as he goosed her, "It used to be

02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:17.699
"grand, but just look at my hand. You ain't wiping
as clean as you used to."

02:35:17.699 --> 02:35:22.630
(sounds of dismay)

02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:24.683
LAURA: What did you give him, Taliesin?

02:35:24.683 --> 02:35:26.837
TALIESIN: The only thing I could think of.

02:35:26.837 --> 02:35:29.562
MARISHA: What horror have you brought upon us?!

02:35:29.562 --> 02:35:36.340
MATT: Even an ambassador to the Nine Hells is
taken aback by the sheer filthiness of this

02:35:36.340 --> 02:35:38.895
limerick. Go ahead and roll your d12.

02:35:38.895 --> 02:35:42.299
SAM: It's bad. It's two.

02:35:42.299 --> 02:35:46.111
MATT: The mace hits you from the side.

02:35:46.111 --> 02:35:49.128
TRAVIS: Just for the sheer limerick.

02:35:49.128 --> 02:35:54.411
MATT: That is 11 points of bludgeoning damage.

02:35:54.411 --> 02:36:04.590
MARISHA: Yeah, we're starting to-- not like this.
Starting to drop like flies.

02:36:04.590 --> 02:36:08.721
MATT: Plus 16 points of fire damage. Still
standing, Scanlan?

02:36:08.721 --> 02:36:09.877
SAM: Oh yeah.

02:36:09.877 --> 02:36:16.254
MATT: Nice. All right. That's going to end the pit
fiend's turn. Scanlan, you're up.

02:36:16.254 --> 02:36:20.611
SAM: Nothing has worked on this motherfucker.
Nothing!

02:36:20.611 --> 02:36:22.235
LIAM: What about your sword?

02:36:22.235 --> 02:36:25.436
LAURA: Do the sword! Yes, attack him as you run by
him.

02:36:25.436 --> 02:36:29.158
SAM: I still draw Mythcarver, and then I put it
away.

02:36:29.158 --> 02:36:30.788
LAURA: No, come on, attack him.

02:36:30.788 --> 02:36:32.042
SAM: I don't hit things with swords.

02:36:32.042 --> 02:36:33.881
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it's vibrating.

02:36:33.881 --> 02:36:38.776
SAM: If I did something with everything that
vibrated on my body, I would be doing stuff all

02:36:38.776 --> 02:36:40.429
day long, right.

02:36:40.429 --> 02:36:41.951
MATT: Do you pull the blade from the scabbard?

02:36:41.951 --> 02:36:44.407
SAM: I did in the last turn. It's still out.

02:36:44.407 --> 02:36:50.943
MATT: Right, the second time, as you pull the
blade out, you can see it's glowing, and it's like

02:36:50.943 --> 02:37:00.101
a tuning fork. It's vibrating at the tip, and the
sword is wanting to guide you. It's your call.

02:37:00.101 --> 02:37:02.930
MARISHA: I feel like this is a very strong hint
from the Dungeon Master.

02:37:02.930 --> 02:37:06.558
SAM: I'm not picking up any signs from him.

02:37:06.558 --> 02:37:11.686
TRAVIS: I think you should just put it away. Maybe
offer him the Mythcarver to leave us alone.

02:37:11.686 --> 02:37:15.785
MATT: What do you want to do, Scanlan? Your choice
entirely.

02:37:15.785 --> 02:37:22.771
SAM: I'm going to bonus action heal myself,
Healing Word level two. Okay, two of these. So

02:37:22.771 --> 02:37:26.384
that's nine points.

02:37:26.384 --> 02:37:29.472
MATT: You get nine points, all right. You heal
nine points.

02:37:29.472 --> 02:37:36.793
SAM: Great, and then I'm going to let the sword
guide me. I'm going to position it around my belt

02:37:36.793 --> 02:37:43.827
and thrust forward at the beast. I don't know what
to do now.

02:37:43.827 --> 02:37:45.615
LIAM: Roll a d20 to start.

02:37:45.615 --> 02:37:49.777
MATT: Okay, so you used your Cutting Words
feature, so your attack's at advantage, right?

02:37:49.777 --> 02:37:51.113
SAM: Yes.

02:37:51.113 --> 02:37:58.545
MATT: So, as you let the sword guide you, you feel
this energy, this warmth come from the blade, fill

02:37:58.545 --> 02:38:05.048
your arms, and for a second you watch and feel the
spirit of a hundred bards that have wielded this

02:38:05.048 --> 02:38:10.014
blade course through you. You see many, many foes
that have fallen to its blade and those that have

02:38:10.014 --> 02:38:15.876
fallen clutching it at their side. And utilizing
that, you unleash a flurry. You actually get to

02:38:15.876 --> 02:38:18.946
attack four times, all with advantage.

02:38:18.946 --> 02:38:22.197
TRAVIS: With advantage!

02:38:22.197 --> 02:38:26.383
MARISHA: You've had this by your side the whole
time?

02:38:26.383 --> 02:38:28.896
SAM: Okay.

02:38:28.896 --> 02:38:32.364
LIAM: Whatever it is, Matt's been sitting on it
for months. Months.

02:38:32.364 --> 02:38:36.572
SAM: First one is 24. I think.

02:38:36.572 --> 02:38:38.367
MATT: 24 hits.

02:38:38.367 --> 02:38:39.667
MARISHA: That's real good.

02:38:39.667 --> 02:38:44.892
SAM: The second one is more than that. I'm not
even going to do the math. Third one's even more

02:38:44.892 --> 02:38:51.161
than that. I'm not going to do the math. The
fourth one is-- Well this is cocked, so I'm going

02:38:51.161 --> 02:38:53.765
to redo that one. It was a ten plus nine, 19.

02:38:53.765 --> 02:38:57.221
MATT: That last one misses, but the first three
hit. Go ahead and roll damage on those.

02:38:57.221 --> 02:39:05.327
TALIESIN: Mythcarver is a 1d8 and a 1d6 plus
three.

02:39:05.327 --> 02:39:27.753
SAM: Okay. So we're up to 16. Not very much. Ooh,
that's good. 29 total.

02:39:27.753 --> 02:39:37.055
MATT: 29 total, okay. So as the energy courses
through your body, the blade in your hand.

02:39:37.055 --> 02:39:38.772
How do you want to do this?

02:39:38.772 --> 02:39:41.158
(cheering)

02:39:41.158 --> 02:39:43.425
TRAVIS: On the pit fiend?

02:39:43.425 --> 02:39:45.089
LAURA: Are you fucking kidding me?

02:39:45.089 --> 02:39:46.616
SAM: I get to kill the pit fiend?

02:39:46.616 --> 02:39:48.925
LAURA: And the only person that saw it was fucking
Keyleth.

02:39:48.925 --> 02:39:50.595
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:39:50.595 --> 02:39:55.674
TALIESIN: Yeah, this doesn't feel fair.

02:39:55.674 --> 02:39:57.434
TRAVIS: Are you serious?

02:39:57.434 --> 02:40:02.052
MATT: He only had 22 hit points left.

02:40:02.052 --> 02:40:11.987
SAM: As I slice, I want to slice one wing off,
then the other wing off, and then, as I stab him

02:40:11.987 --> 02:40:19.831
straight through the heart, I will say: no one
messes up a deal with Francois Australia!

02:40:19.831 --> 02:40:25.282
TRAVIS: I cannot believe it. I &lt;i&gt;cannot&lt;/i&gt; believe
it.

02:40:25.282 --> 02:40:27.862
LAURA: And all of us have been fucking running.

02:40:27.862 --> 02:40:31.931
TRAVIS: Yeah, but the Vestige got used!

02:40:31.931 --> 02:40:38.953
MATT: As one wing is cloven off from one side, in
a clean cut, it turns into ash and fire on one

02:40:38.953 --> 02:40:44.139
side. The other wing darts off, hits the lava, and
turns to ash across the top of that. This time, as

02:40:44.139 --> 02:40:50.143
it's snarling toward you, the voice in your head
saying, "I will find you!" the blade (stabbing)

02:40:50.143 --> 02:40:56.072
right through its chest. (gasping) Its jaw hangs
open as you say that. Its eyes go dark, and the

02:40:56.072 --> 02:40:58.695
body burns into ash and dissipates.

02:40:58.695 --> 02:41:09.155
SAM: I drop to my knees, start crying, and say,
I'm so amazing!

02:41:09.155 --> 02:41:14.598
TRAVIS: I never knew!

02:41:14.598 --> 02:41:26.715
SAM: I have the power! The power of Greyskull! All
right, so I'll-- shit. That's it! Oh shit, so,

02:41:26.715 --> 02:41:35.650
there's a guy. There's a guard, right? Oh, shit. I
can't do anything to him. So I'll just yell at

02:41:35.650 --> 02:41:42.662
him, he was an assassin, sent to kill the Sultan!

02:41:42.662 --> 02:41:44.603
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:41:44.603 --> 02:41:46.421
TALIESIN: &lt;i&gt;Please&lt;/i&gt; make a deception check.

02:41:46.421 --> 02:41:48.816
MARISHA: Come on, come on! Come on, bard!

02:41:48.816 --> 02:41:54.860
SAM: 34. That's 18 plus 16, whatever that is.

02:41:54.860 --> 02:42:02.661
MATT: The efreeti stops his assault on you. It was
ready for another Fireball, and as you shout this,

02:42:02.661 --> 02:42:13.502
it halts. (grunting) It's taken pause. You're not
sure it believes you. Everything that it's seeing

02:42:13.731 --> 02:42:19.588
here, probably familiar with the pit fiend and the
power that it holds, versus one of the

02:42:19.588 --> 02:42:24.955
Illuminated. You see it looking over, past your
shoulder. You glance over and you see five more

02:42:24.955 --> 02:42:32.863
efreeti walking in the direction that it called.
It's taken pause, though. Meanwhile, I need you to

02:42:32.863 --> 02:42:34.646
make another death saving throw.

02:42:34.646 --> 02:42:36.741
ASHLEY: Can I run out to her?

02:42:36.741 --> 02:42:41.507
LIAM: You're unconscious. Oh, Percy helped her!
That's right.

02:42:41.507 --> 02:42:43.171
LAURA: 12.

02:42:43.171 --> 02:42:51.484
MATT: Okay. So you're okay for now. However, you
still take poison damage from the poison pulsing

02:42:51.484 --> 02:42:52.925
through your system.

02:42:52.925 --> 02:42:55.941
LAURA: So that's an automatic fail. So thank god I
passed, because I would have just died!

02:42:55.941 --> 02:43:01.838
TALIESIN: I'm going to finish dragging her in, so
that we can fix this.

02:43:01.838 --> 02:43:03.768
LIAM: Are we out of combat?

02:43:03.768 --> 02:43:05.485
MATT: Not yet.

02:43:05.485 --> 02:43:09.300
TALIESIN: So no, I'm so sorry. I'm going out of
turn, then. I'll wait.

02:43:09.300 --> 02:43:14.750
MATT: There is the efreeti that is standing there
and has halted his assault. He's assessing the

02:43:14.750 --> 02:43:15.950
situation.

02:43:15.950 --> 02:43:17.757
LIAM: If we're out of combat, I'll do Lay on
Hands.

02:43:17.757 --> 02:43:19.175
LAURA: We're not out of combat.

02:43:19.175 --> 02:43:24.096
MATT: So that's the end of Vex's turn. Keyleth,
what are you doing? You're currently up where it

02:43:24.096 --> 02:43:29.862
was, in your elemental form, with multiple efreeti
making their way down the road this way.

02:43:29.862 --> 02:43:33.629
SAM: I got something! But I've got to wait my
turn.

02:43:33.629 --> 02:43:36.761
MARISHA: Do we try to get in the mansion, or what
do we do?

02:43:36.761 --> 02:43:39.504
TRAVIS: Yeah, mansion. Mansion.

02:43:39.504 --> 02:43:41.576
LIAM: Safe bet.

02:43:41.576 --> 02:43:50.662
MARISHA: Okay, can I, as part of my speed-- I
wasn't that high up, I was just hovering above--

02:43:50.662 --> 02:43:56.360
can I go down, scoop up Scanlan, and both of us
bolt into the mansion?

02:43:56.360 --> 02:43:58.511
LAURA: Why Scanlan? Why not me?

02:43:58.511 --> 02:44:00.668
SAM: Every time you try to pick me up, I say no.

02:44:00.668 --> 02:44:05.664
MARISHA: Vex is right on the outside of the door?

02:44:05.664 --> 02:44:07.838
MATT: She's unconscious, and poisoned, and
bleeding out--

02:44:07.838 --> 02:44:13.187
MARISHA: Right on the outside of the door. Okay,
I'm going to swoop down and drag her in.

02:44:13.187 --> 02:44:15.737
LAURA: Vex will remember this.

02:44:15.737 --> 02:44:17.622
MARISHA: Do I still have an action?

02:44:17.622 --> 02:44:20.586
MATT: You would have an action, yes. You do.

02:44:20.586 --> 02:44:23.399
MARISHA: I drop my elemental form.

02:44:23.399 --> 02:44:25.667
MATT: Okay, so you are now back to Keyleth.

02:44:25.667 --> 02:44:28.024
MARISHA: And I cast Protection from Poison on
her.

02:44:28.024 --> 02:44:31.055
MATT: Okay, the poison is no longer pulsing in
your veins, Vex.

02:44:31.055 --> 02:44:32.514
LAURA: Thank you.

02:44:32.514 --> 02:44:38.791
MARISHA: Thank god I took that!

02:44:38.791 --> 02:44:44.583
MATT: All right. So, that being the case, Grog,
you're up.

02:44:44.583 --> 02:44:48.195
TRAVIS: Can I poke my head out the mansion and see
who's still outside?

02:44:48.195 --> 02:44:55.401
MATT: Yeah, as you poke your head out, you can see
there is a singular efreet that is standing on the

02:44:55.401 --> 02:45:01.435
edge there, that is, flame in his hand, crackling,
staring at Scanlan, but in a reserved position.

02:45:01.435 --> 02:45:04.865
You see about five of them rounding the corner
towards the Arches.

02:45:04.865 --> 02:45:07.831
TRAVIS: I look around. Is Scanlan still outside?

02:45:07.831 --> 02:45:11.840
MATT: Scanlan is still outside. Scanlan's off in
the corner. You see him.

02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:24.667
TRAVIS: Pardon me, Master Australia. The slaves
need hosing down. And I retreat inside the

02:45:24.667 --> 02:45:25.946
doorway.

02:45:25.946 --> 02:45:27.462
MATT: Make a deception check, Grog.

02:45:27.462 --> 02:45:28.986
LAURA: Oh no.

02:45:28.986 --> 02:45:30.685
SAM: Right away, Grog.

02:45:30.685 --> 02:45:33.698
TRAVIS: 13! Plus one.

02:45:33.698 --> 02:45:45.460
MATT: The efreet standing there went from unsure
if truth to, "They're fucking lying." Eyes glare

02:45:45.460 --> 02:45:49.899
back at you, Scanlan. Vax. What are you doing?

02:45:49.899 --> 02:45:54.466
LIAM: I scuttle over to my sister, then, and scoop
her head up. I'm looking out the door, watching

02:45:54.466 --> 02:46:00.747
what's happening with Grog, give her a gentle
noogie and cast Lay on Hands, last five hit points

02:46:00.747 --> 02:46:02.169
to bring her health to awake.

02:46:02.169 --> 02:46:04.311
MATT: So you're now conscious, Vex.

02:46:04.311 --> 02:46:06.834
LAURA: Well, that sucked.

02:46:06.834 --> 02:46:09.668
MATT: Percy.

02:46:09.668 --> 02:46:25.925
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my turn to wait for
the efreet to encounter Scanlan.

02:46:25.925 --> 02:46:33.072
LIAM: I'll also say that I'll hold an attack if an
efreet pokes its face in the door.

02:46:33.072 --> 02:46:44.382
MATT: We have more efreet heading down this
pathway here. Scanlan, it's your turn.

02:46:44.382 --> 02:46:46.147
SAM: Handcone up.

02:46:46.147 --> 02:46:48.994
ASHLEY: I think I got skipped!

02:46:48.994 --> 02:46:50.795
MATT: Pike, you're after Scanlan.

02:46:50.795 --> 02:46:55.620
LAURA: There's one person left before you.

02:46:55.620 --> 02:46:58.107
ASHLEY: Oh, so Scanlan goes again?

02:46:58.107 --> 02:47:03.794
MATT: Oh! I did accidentally miss your turn last
time in the mansion. What do you want to do, Pike?

02:47:03.794 --> 02:47:08.446
ASHLEY: Can I peek outside?

02:47:08.446 --> 02:47:10.331
LAURA: I'm in the mansion now.

02:47:10.331 --> 02:47:11.722
ASHLEY: You're in the mansion?

02:47:11.722 --> 02:47:13.708
LIAM: She's awake, but very low.

02:47:13.708 --> 02:47:15.289
LAURA: I've got like one hit point.

02:47:15.289 --> 02:47:16.194
LIAM: Five.

02:47:16.194 --> 02:47:17.451
LAURA: I've got five hit points.

02:47:17.451 --> 02:47:24.013
ASHLEY: Okay! I'm going to check what I have left
here, which is, let's see.

02:47:24.013 --> 02:47:27.137
LIAM: Actually, let's say it's one. Not five.

02:47:27.137 --> 02:47:32.281
MATT: You gave her one. Just one. You can do that;
you can mete it out.

02:47:32.281 --> 02:47:36.330
ASHLEY: I'm going to do Cure Wounds at fifth
level.

02:47:36.330 --> 02:47:39.571
MATT: 5th-level Cure Wounds onto you, Vex.

02:47:39.571 --> 02:47:44.398
LIAM: I'm just an EMT; she's the doctor.

02:47:44.398 --> 02:47:52.443
SAM: Oh! Yeah, I got something.

02:47:52.443 --> 02:47:58.421
TALIESIN: That's why I'm holding my turn! If you
can make this go away, I will be very happy.

02:47:58.421 --> 02:48:00.760
MATT: This is looking very bad.

02:48:00.760 --> 02:48:01.910
TALIESIN: Yeah!

02:48:01.910 --> 02:48:03.597
MATT: This is the entire city guard now coming at
you.

02:48:03.597 --> 02:48:05.365
LAURA: Oh Jeebus.

02:48:05.365 --> 02:48:07.510
SAM: That's a book full of shit limericks.

02:48:07.510 --> 02:48:10.205
MATT: How much does that heal?

02:48:10.205 --> 02:48:14.598
ASHLEY: 35.

02:48:14.598 --> 02:48:16.164
LAURA: Yay! Thank you!

02:48:16.164 --> 02:48:20.726
MATT: Looking much better than you did a second
ago. That ends your turn, Pike, or are you going

02:48:20.726 --> 02:48:22.184
to do anything else?

02:48:22.184 --> 02:48:29.805
ASHLEY: I'm going to stay here in the mansion
because I'm useless.

02:48:29.805 --> 02:48:31.072
LAURA: No!

02:48:31.072 --> 02:48:35.555
MATT: Scanlan, you're now about to be flanked by a
series of efreet.

02:48:35.555 --> 02:48:43.122
SAM: I take one step closer to the efreet, putting
me within 30 feet of him. I will hand cone up, and

02:48:43.122 --> 02:48:55.784
I will sing to him to try to charm him. I'll sing:
(sings) my Grog don't like you, and he likes

02:48:55.784 --> 02:49:04.796
everyone! And I should have known that you'd try
to run! But I got so caught up in my spells I

02:49:04.796 --> 02:49:14.484
didn't see that you were trying to rat me out! But
I can't do that right now! I don't know.

02:49:14.484 --> 02:49:18.148
So I'm going to cast Modify Memory at sixth
level.

02:49:18.148 --> 02:49:20.774
ALL: Oh!

02:49:20.774 --> 02:49:27.657
SAM: Ten minutes have not gone by! This whole
thing's taken two minutes, right?

02:49:27.657 --> 02:49:31.724
MATT: This whole thing's been, roughly, from
beginning to end, about two minutes, yeah. From a

02:49:31.724 --> 02:49:39.975
spatial positioning standpoint. Okay! It has to
make a wisdom saving throw. Because technically

02:49:39.975 --> 02:49:43.311
you are fighting the creature because Grog made it
hostile again, it does get advantage on the saving throw.

02:49:43.311 --> 02:49:44.894
SAM: Fuck!

02:49:44.894 --> 02:49:47.839
LIAM: Can I use my Luck on him? I have one left.
Watching this.

02:49:47.839 --> 02:49:50.916
MATT: I think it may be just an attack.

02:49:50.916 --> 02:49:52.492
LIAM: I don't think so.

02:49:52.492 --> 02:49:55.143
MATT: That's why I'm going to check, yo.

02:49:55.143 --> 02:49:58.800
LIAM: I'm wrong about a lot of things, Matt.
In-game and out of game.

02:49:58.800 --> 02:50:01.040
MATT: I'm glad you're using it on enemy rolls
now!

02:50:01.040 --> 02:50:11.146
SAM: There's nothing in that book that says he
can't! There's something in &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; book that says

02:50:11.146 --> 02:50:13.190
something much worse.

02:50:13.190 --> 02:50:15.896
TALIESIN: Have you looked at the table of contents
yet? You should look at the table of contents.

02:50:15.896 --> 02:50:17.619
It'll make you really happy.

02:50:17.619 --> 02:50:19.790
MATT: You can also spend a luck point when an
attack roll is made against you.

02:50:19.790 --> 02:50:21.436
LIAM: Just attack rolls, all right.

02:50:21.436 --> 02:50:23.559
MATT: That would've been really powerful.

02:50:23.559 --> 02:50:27.582
SAM: "Abuses of the Clergy"?

02:50:27.582 --> 02:50:29.196
TALIESIN: That's my favorite chapter.

02:50:29.196 --> 02:50:38.415
MATT: That's cocked. That is 19. What is your
spell DC, again?

02:50:38.415 --> 02:50:39.590
SAM: 21.

02:50:39.590 --> 02:50:46.023
MATT: You watch its eyes glaze over for a minute,
and the flame flickers out in its hand as it drops

02:50:46.023 --> 02:50:47.980
to the side. What are you doing? What are you
modifying?

02:50:47.980 --> 02:50:57.220
SAM: I'm telling him: You heard this fiend pledge
to murder the Sultan. It's a Sultan, right? You

02:50:57.220 --> 02:51:04.685
heard this fiend pledge to murder the Sultan and
you, joined with us, defeated him. You are brave.

02:51:04.685 --> 02:51:08.444
You are strong. You should tell everyone this.

02:51:08.444 --> 02:51:16.167
MATT: So you paint out this whole memory, this
whole image of watching this pit fiend, caught by

02:51:16.167 --> 02:51:28.366
you guys and this Illuminated efreet, that this
plot was uncovered. The scuffle continued and you

02:51:28.366 --> 02:51:33.341
make this entire epic battle, where somehow you're
the most powerful creature in the universe and

02:51:33.341 --> 02:51:40.455
tore this thing asunder, practically one-handed,
next to this efreet. You instill it with the joy

02:51:40.455 --> 02:51:47.487
and the pride that it just foiled a plot against
the Sultan. You watch as its limp self puffs up

02:51:47.487 --> 02:51:52.457
with its hands on its hips. As the spell finishes
taking effect, rewriting its memory, it looks down

02:51:52.457 --> 02:51:57.401
at you and goes, "You are brave, small one!"

02:51:57.401 --> 02:51:59.712
SAM: Not as brave as you, sir!

02:51:59.712 --> 02:52:05.446
MATT: "Your assistance will be remembered." He
puts his hand out to clasp yours. It encompasses

02:52:05.446 --> 02:52:10.398
your entire elbow with a Beastmaster shake.

02:52:10.398 --> 02:52:11.566
SAM: Noodle arm!

02:52:11.566 --> 02:52:19.297
MATT: As the rest of the Illuminated swoop in now
to catch up, weapons drawn, the one that you were

02:52:19.297 --> 02:52:29.600
talking to goes, "There is no need! We have
thwarted the plot. The Sultan is safe. This slaver

02:52:29.600 --> 02:52:42.180
"here, and his paltry allies, they helped me stop
it." The rest of the Illuminated go, "Piss off.

02:52:42.180 --> 02:52:53.616
"You're blowing-- Stop blowing smoke. Well done."
The efreet that you cast on looks a little

02:52:53.616 --> 02:53:03.818
deflated. "No, but seriously!" Points to the ashes
there on the ground and goes to join the rest of

02:53:03.818 --> 02:53:08.609
them. They're giving him shit. You can tell
there's a rapport with them. They don't fully

02:53:08.609 --> 02:53:14.963
believe his story, but there doesn't appear to be
any intent against you. Through a brief

02:53:14.963 --> 02:53:23.108
conversation with them, they have no reason to
consider you an enemy. You've, through a single

02:53:23.108 --> 02:53:30.374
series of lucky rolls and a perfect use of Modify
Memory, prevented the probably 10,000-ish

02:53:30.374 --> 02:53:33.703
Illuminated that were in the city. Let me look at
the specific--

02:53:33.703 --> 02:53:40.452
TALIESIN: I just want to double check, I still
have my attack, though? So I can actually hit him and--

02:53:40.452 --> 02:53:43.196
SAM: Yeah, that's a great idea! Do that.

02:53:43.196 --> 02:53:46.339
MATT: More than that! You're looking at 50,000
Illuminated that are in the City Guard.

02:53:46.339 --> 02:53:48.560
SAM: 50,000?!

02:53:48.560 --> 02:53:55.573
TALIESIN: I'm going to saunter over to the pile of
ash and see if there's any proof that I can grab

02:53:55.573 --> 02:53:57.064
that we took care of this.

02:53:57.064 --> 02:54:06.209
TRAVIS: I would join him so I can grab the mallet,
the mace that the pit fiend had. Unless it turned

02:54:06.209 --> 02:54:07.672
to ash as well.

02:54:07.672 --> 02:54:12.376
MATT: It did not turn to ashes. However, when you
grab it, it is a dull, cold iron mace that is too

02:54:12.376 --> 02:54:13.658
large for you to use.

02:54:13.658 --> 02:54:15.014
TRAVIS: Too large for me?

02:54:15.014 --> 02:54:18.019
MATT: I mean, you could use it, but it would be
disadvantage on attacks.

02:54:18.019 --> 02:54:27.556
MARISHA: But he can carry it, right? Proof. You've
got to trade it for the Dawnmartyr armor. Is there

02:54:27.556 --> 02:54:29.704
anything else left of him?

02:54:29.704 --> 02:54:32.716
MATT: No, the rest of it's just ash. The rest of
it burned away into ash.

02:54:32.716 --> 02:54:37.007
MARISHA: Didn't he have a symbol on his chest, or
whatever?

02:54:37.007 --> 02:54:42.764
MATT: There is the symbol that he had, yeah. You
would find that, which is his mark of his station

02:54:42.764 --> 02:54:44.026
within the embassy.

02:54:44.026 --> 02:54:49.097
TALIESIN: Was he wearing a leather thong kind of
thing, with a flap? Because I feel like I could

02:54:49.097 --> 02:54:50.073
really--

02:54:50.073 --> 02:54:51.215
MATT: &lt;i&gt;Nope.&lt;/i&gt;

02:54:51.215 --> 02:54:52.163
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:54:52.163 --> 02:55:02.394
MATT: Look at the mini-- Nope. Did you check for
anything else, while you're here? As apparently

02:55:02.394 --> 02:55:05.051
the rest of the crowd has begun to come back and
fill in the Arches again.

02:55:05.051 --> 02:55:06.545
LIAM: Let's am-scray.

02:55:06.545 --> 02:55:08.690
TRAVIS: What about the rope she had? The lasso?

02:55:08.690 --> 02:55:11.030
TALIESIN: Go look to see if there's anything
left.

02:55:11.030 --> 02:55:13.472
LAURA: I'll fly up there and see.

02:55:13.472 --> 02:55:16.578
TALIESIN: And let's all take a short rest and then
go back.

02:55:16.578 --> 02:55:22.876
MATT: Okay, there is her armor scattered across
the top of the wall. The bow is broken. There is

02:55:22.876 --> 02:55:28.019
the longsword, and you do see the rope still
there, as well as a pair of nice boots.

02:55:28.019 --> 02:55:29.409
LAURA: I'll grab it all.

02:55:29.409 --> 02:55:32.396
SAM: Nice boots. You have so many fucking boots.

02:55:32.396 --> 02:55:37.692
MATT: So you grab the sword, you grab the boots,
and you grab the lasso.

02:55:37.692 --> 02:55:41.161
SAM: No one wears shoes in this world? Only
boots?

02:55:41.161 --> 02:55:49.161
MATT: Everybody ducks inside of the mansion. All
right. As you guys all duck into the mansion, take

02:55:49.161 --> 02:55:54.144
a rest, we're going to take a bathroom break here.
We'll be back here in a minute. We have a little

02:55:54.144 --> 02:55:58.128
more story resolution to go through before I
finish the episode tonight, so hold off just a

02:55:58.128 --> 02:55:59.276
second.

02:55:59.276 --> 02:56:01.337
MARISHA: That was a three hour fight.

02:56:01.337 --> 02:56:10.176
MATT: And Scanlan, you can go ahead and get your--
This is Mythcarver in its awoken form.

02:56:10.176 --> 02:56:17.300
LAURA: Matt, before I go in the mansion, I gather
up those gems that I threw at the efreet.

02:56:17.300 --> 02:56:22.434
MATT: Okay, gather gems. We are having a giveaway
tonight. Our fantastic friends at Wyrmwood are

02:56:22.434 --> 02:56:30.555
giving away this awesome magnetic dice box. I
believe, they check in the chat room, right? So go

02:56:30.555 --> 02:56:34.888
ahead and check in the chat room, you can go ahead
and enter. They'll have the instructions there.

02:56:34.888 --> 02:56:40.942
We'll have the announcement of who wins this at
the end of the break. Okay, after break, we'll

02:56:40.942 --> 02:56:43.308
come back with the winner of that. So pay
attention to the chat room, enter. We'll give

02:56:43.308 --> 02:56:46.849
away, to one lucky winner, this awesome Wyrmwood
dice box. Thank you guys. We'll see you back here

02:56:46.849 --> 02:56:47.978
in a few minutes.

02:56:47.978 --> 02:56:49.900
MARISHA: Woo, we didn't die!

02:56:49.900 --> 03:05:41.561
[break]

03:05:41.561 --> 03:05:45.828
MATT: Hello, guys, and welcome back to Critical
Role! We do have a winner in the chat room:

03:05:45.828 --> 03:05:55.836
jenksone9. You are going to be winning this
awesome Wyrmwood dice box. Congratulations! Make

03:05:55.836 --> 03:05:59.564
sure that you talk with our mods and folks in the
chat room to get your information.

03:05:59.564 --> 03:06:04.032
Congratulations, and thank you for entering!
Awesome.

03:06:04.032 --> 03:06:12.030
So. Returning to the circumstance. You, Vox
Machina: bruised, beaten, and through some clutch

03:06:12.030 --> 03:06:17.301
timing-- and thank god some of you guys got
initiative at the top of that round. Maybe we'll

03:06:17.301 --> 03:06:20.603
talk more about this on Talks on Tuesday, because
there's some shit that could have gone really

03:06:20.603 --> 03:06:27.053
wrong if you guys didn't get initiative or if you
hadn't grappled him at the beginning. Yeah, it

03:06:27.053 --> 03:06:32.666
would've been bad. Anyway, while you guys are
taking a short rest-- so you can go ahead and use

03:06:32.666 --> 03:06:36.543
as many of your hit dice to heal up, if you want
to.

03:06:36.543 --> 03:06:40.203
LAURA: We probably should've done that on the
break.

03:06:40.203 --> 03:06:52.183
SAM: I can sing a song to heal you all by 1d12. Is
that right?

03:06:52.183 --> 03:06:55.129
MATT: On top of whatever you used your hit dice
on, you also heal 1d12.

03:06:55.129 --> 03:07:05.042
SAM: Okay, I will sing a song. I will sing:
(singing) Heal thee! With a song, heal thee, all

03:07:05.042 --> 03:07:08.731
night, all night, all night long. Heal thee.

03:07:08.731 --> 03:07:14.014
LIAM: So 1d12, and then we do whatever after
that.

03:07:14.014 --> 03:07:15.058
MATT: Correct.

03:07:15.058 --> 03:07:16.550
ASHLEY: 1d12 plus what?

03:07:16.550 --> 03:07:19.394
MATT: Well, he rolls it, so Sam, go ahead and roll
that.

03:07:19.394 --> 03:07:20.999
SAM: It's a 12!

03:07:20.999 --> 03:07:25.196
MATT: Everyone heals 12 hit points, and then let
me know how much you heal based on your hit dice.

03:07:25.196 --> 03:07:26.834
TALIESIN: Fully healed.

03:07:26.834 --> 03:07:28.327
MATT: All right, Percy's fully healed.

03:07:28.327 --> 03:07:34.994
TALIESIN: Oh, and short rest, which means I get
all that back, and I get that back.

03:07:34.994 --> 03:07:40.577
SAM: Hit dice, huh? Okay, lots of math going on.

03:07:40.577 --> 03:07:45.813
MATT: Is anyone looking at the items you found?

03:07:45.813 --> 03:07:48.330
LAURA: Sure, I'll look at my stuff.

03:07:48.330 --> 03:07:51.306
MATT: Okay. Boots or rope?

03:07:51.306 --> 03:07:54.298
TRAVIS: I healed up to 168.

03:07:54.298 --> 03:07:56.169
MATT: 168 on Grog. All righty.

03:07:56.169 --> 03:07:59.959
LIAM: I'm up to full. 99.

03:07:59.959 --> 03:08:01.455
MATT: Vax is full.

03:08:01.455 --> 03:08:05.204
SAM: I'm up to 85.

03:08:05.204 --> 03:08:07.068
MATT: 85 on Scanlan.

03:08:07.068 --> 03:08:11.724
MARISHA: I am up to 80.

03:08:11.724 --> 03:08:13.813
LAURA: I'm up to 100.

03:08:13.813 --> 03:08:17.311
MATT: Awesome, so boots or rope, Vex?

03:08:17.311 --> 03:08:21.225
LAURA: The rope, and I'm going to pass the boots
to Keyleth to look at.

03:08:21.225 --> 03:08:23.337
MATT: Okay, so I'm going to pass these over to you
guys.

03:08:23.337 --> 03:08:24.878
TRAVIS: Oh god!

03:08:24.878 --> 03:08:40.571
LAURA: Ooh! Here you go. I passed this to you so
you could look at them. This is the Rope of

03:08:40.571 --> 03:08:45.840
Entanglement. The rope is 30 feet long and weighs
three pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and

03:08:45.840 --> 03:08:50.660
use an action to speak its command word, the other
end darts forward to entangle a creature you see

03:08:50.660 --> 03:08:58.840
within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed a
DC of 15 dexterity, or become restrained.

03:08:58.840 --> 03:09:01.873
TRAVIS: Do you read that slow all the time?

03:09:01.873 --> 03:09:09.068
LAURA: Yes. You can release a creature by a bonus
action. Target restrained by the rope can use an

03:09:09.068 --> 03:09:11.850
action-- I'm trying to scan it.

03:09:11.850 --> 03:09:17.090
MATT: So you essentially release the rope as an
action toward a creature within 20 feet, and it

03:09:17.090 --> 03:09:19.560
tries to wrap it and restrain it.

03:09:19.706 --> 03:09:21.645
TRAVIS: They'd essentially be grappled.

03:09:21.645 --> 03:09:25.032
MATT: Restrained. Grapple just means their
movement is brought to zero. Restrained means their

03:09:25.032 --> 03:09:28.607
movement is brought to zero, attack rolls against
them have advantage, and attack rolls that they

03:09:28.607 --> 03:09:31.829
make have disadvantage. And they have disadvantage
on dexterity saving throws.

03:09:31.829 --> 03:09:33.585
LAURA: And it's a bonus action?

03:09:33.585 --> 03:09:35.190
MATT: It's an action.

03:09:35.190 --> 03:09:42.007
TALIESIN: Do ranged attacks also have advantage?
Oh! So you grab something and we start whaling on

03:09:42.007 --> 03:09:43.862
it from a distance?

03:09:43.862 --> 03:09:52.349
MATT: Well, grapple is different from restrained.
With the rope, yeah, you can do that. You're your

03:09:52.349 --> 03:09:54.446
own moving gallows.

03:09:54.446 --> 03:10:01.376
TRAVIS: It can be destroyed. It has 20 hit points
and an AC of 20. Is it limited by the size of the

03:10:01.376 --> 03:10:02.691
creature?

03:10:02.691 --> 03:10:04.173
MATT: Yeah.

03:10:04.173 --> 03:10:07.872
TRAVIS: I can't restrain a fire giant?

03:10:07.872 --> 03:10:10.804
MATT: Probably not going to work on Thordak, just
saying.

03:10:10.804 --> 03:10:19.665
MARISHA: These boots appear to actually be boots
that my people might have made. They are Boots of

03:10:19.665 --> 03:10:26.979
Spider Climbing. The wearer can spend an action to
cast Spider Climb on themselves, no concentration

03:10:26.979 --> 03:10:38.100
required. The effect lasts for an hour. Spider
Climb lets you-- I go to Percy. He's waving dibs.

03:10:38.100 --> 03:10:41.095
TALIESIN: Yes, no, this is definitely for me.

03:10:41.095 --> 03:10:44.265
LAURA: Does anybody want this rope?

03:10:44.265 --> 03:10:45.596
TRAVIS: Hello.

03:10:45.596 --> 03:10:47.398
LAURA: You want the Rope of Entanglement?

03:10:47.398 --> 03:10:50.039
ASHLEY: I healed to 74, B-T-W.

03:10:50.039 --> 03:10:51.991
MATT: Thank you, Pike.

03:10:51.991 --> 03:10:55.219
LAURA: Did I say what I healed to? I did, right?

03:10:55.219 --> 03:11:03.198
MATT: You did, yeah. So as you guys finish a short
rest, you've taken in the circumstance. You've

03:11:03.198 --> 03:11:07.332
narrowly avoided a very, &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; bad situation with
the city.

03:11:07.332 --> 03:11:12.311
MARISHA: I thought that the guards were going to
show up way sooner. We lucked out. They've got a

03:11:12.311 --> 03:11:14.495
low response time in this city.

03:11:14.495 --> 03:11:18.426
TRAVIS: It wasn't bad. It was only a couple
minutes. Better than L.A.

03:11:18.426 --> 03:11:24.210
[static]

03:11:24.210 --> 03:11:35.674
MATT: What do you guys want to do? You're inside
the mansion. You still have the two slaves you

03:11:35.674 --> 03:11:36.997
acquired.

03:11:36.997 --> 03:11:41.139
LAURA: Yeah. Oh, we should talk to them. They're
not in chains, though. Did the servants get the

03:11:41.139 --> 03:11:42.599
chains off of them?

03:11:42.599 --> 03:11:45.421
MATT: The servants did take the chains off of
them. They're both hiding in the back of the foyer

03:11:45.421 --> 03:11:47.094
as you guys are resting.

03:11:47.094 --> 03:11:48.580
TRAVIS: Go on, Vex. See what they want.

03:11:48.580 --> 03:11:54.250
LAURA: All right, I wander over to them. Hello.

03:11:54.250 --> 03:11:56.490
MATT: "Hi."

03:11:56.490 --> 03:11:58.462
LAURA: Hi. What's your name, darling?

03:11:58.462 --> 03:12:08.791
MATT: They both seem a little more relaxed than
when you first spoke with them. "I'm Kyor. He's Hunin."

03:12:08.791 --> 03:12:11.459
LAURA: Kyor and Hunin? Okay.

03:12:11.459 --> 03:12:14.359
MATT: "Thank you."

03:12:14.359 --> 03:12:16.750
LAURA: Of course!

03:12:16.750 --> 03:12:19.014
MATT: "Whatever you need."

03:12:19.014 --> 03:12:21.607
LAURA: How long have you been captured?

03:12:21.607 --> 03:12:25.541
MATT: "Maybe a year?"

03:12:25.541 --> 03:12:29.208
LAURA: Oh no! And where did they take you from?

03:12:29.208 --> 03:12:35.557
MATT: "We were taken from our mother, on the
poorer side of Therines."

03:12:35.557 --> 03:12:40.979
LAURA: Therines? Where is that?

03:12:40.979 --> 03:12:43.757
MATT: "It's in Wildemount."

03:12:43.757 --> 03:12:49.517
LAURA: Oh, okay! We know where that is. Yeah?

03:12:49.517 --> 03:12:51.492
MARISHA: They're from Wildemount?

03:12:51.492 --> 03:12:53.691
MATT: "She sold us off."

03:12:53.691 --> 03:12:56.190
LAURA: &lt;i&gt;She&lt;/i&gt; sold you?! Why?

03:12:56.190 --> 03:12:59.627
MATT: Because we're special.

03:12:59.627 --> 03:13:01.298
LAURA: You are special.

03:13:01.298 --> 03:13:05.131
MARISHA: You're different, too!

03:13:05.131 --> 03:13:14.256
LAURA: All of us are rather different. I hate that
music when I'm talking. It makes me creeped out.

03:13:14.256 --> 03:13:17.403
SAM: Sorry, I'll stop playing.

03:13:17.403 --> 03:13:20.612
LAURA: What are you going to do to me, you creepy
little boys?

03:13:20.612 --> 03:13:23.337
MATT: I've changed the music. For you.

03:13:23.337 --> 03:13:28.522
SAM: Wait, did we get their names yet?

03:13:28.522 --> 03:13:36.080
LAURA: Yes, Kyor and Hunin. Well, would you feel
safe going back to them, or would you like to be

03:13:36.080 --> 03:13:40.948
with us for a while? To your mother, I mean.

03:13:40.948 --> 03:13:45.109
MATT: You can see Hunin, who's being really quiet
and basically letting Kyor talk, and you get the

03:13:45.109 --> 03:13:57.434
sense he's probably the more talkative of the two.
"We have no real care or love for her, for what

03:13:57.434 --> 03:13:59.087
"she's done."

03:13:59.087 --> 03:14:00.664
LAURA: Understandable.

03:14:00.664 --> 03:14:05.521
MATT: "Whatever the fates bring us toward, I
suppose. We'll walk that."

03:14:05.521 --> 03:14:07.638
LAURA: Well, they've brought you toward us,
darling.

03:14:07.638 --> 03:14:11.319
MATT: He still seems uncomfortable and very much
like, "what are you going to do?"

03:14:11.319 --> 03:14:20.251
LAURA: We're not slavers. We don't want you as
slaves. If you'd like to stay with us, we can try

03:14:20.251 --> 03:14:28.790
to keep you safe. At least, we can get you out of
this Fire Plane, if all things go well.

03:14:28.790 --> 03:14:37.570
MATT: Looks over to Hunin. Hunin looks and shakes
his head. "This place is terrible. If you know a

03:14:37.570 --> 03:14:40.572
"way out, please, take us with you."

03:14:40.572 --> 03:14:43.081
TALIESIN: How do you feel about snow?

03:14:43.081 --> 03:14:45.563
MATT: "I like snow. Where we're from, there's lots
of snow."

03:14:45.563 --> 03:14:47.373
TALIESIN: Well, that will do, then!

03:14:47.373 --> 03:14:52.499
MARISHA: There's a very nice city where we came
from. Might be able to start a new life there.

03:14:52.499 --> 03:14:56.372
MATT: "Okay."

03:14:56.372 --> 03:14:58.385
LAURA: How old are you?

03:14:58.385 --> 03:15:04.537
MATT: "We're both about..." You can see they have
to think for a second. You get the sense that they

03:15:04.537 --> 03:15:07.354
probably didn't have a very good education,
either, where they came from.

03:15:07.354 --> 03:15:09.017
TRAVIS: Respect.

03:15:09.017 --> 03:15:12.020
MATT: "About 15?"

03:15:12.020 --> 03:15:13.910
LAURA: 15?

03:15:13.910 --> 03:15:20.531
TRAVIS: I think I might be that many.

03:15:20.531 --> 03:15:23.297
LAURA: Well, you can come with us for a while, all
right?

03:15:23.297 --> 03:15:25.241
MATT: "Yes."

03:15:25.241 --> 03:15:34.379
LAURA: All right. Did you eat some chicken? Have
some chicken. Put some meat on your little bones.

03:15:34.379 --> 03:15:39.301
MATT: The other spectral servants come and take
their hands, lift up, and lead them toward the

03:15:39.301 --> 03:15:44.310
kitchen where they both excitedly seem to enjoy
the prospect of fresh food.

03:15:44.310 --> 03:15:46.702
LAURA: Eat quickly, though, because we'll probably
be leaving soon.

03:15:46.702 --> 03:15:51.630
SAM: We could leave them here while we go do our
business.

03:15:51.630 --> 03:15:55.871
MARISHA: We don't need to check back in with
Senokir. He already has a way to get hold of us.

03:15:55.871 --> 03:15:59.648
LAURA: So we could just go straight to-- Okay.

03:15:59.648 --> 03:16:04.067
MARISAHA: If you guys are fine with it, I think we
can check back in to repay our debt to Senokir

03:16:04.067 --> 03:16:05.495
another time?

03:16:05.495 --> 03:16:07.647
SAM: We need to get our armor.

03:16:07.647 --> 03:16:09.638
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I mean.

03:16:09.638 --> 03:16:15.257
MARISHA: But we can stealth there, get the armor,
and then get out.

03:16:15.257 --> 03:16:23.981
LIAM: Wait a second, though. Grog, that magic
bucket you have, does it make champagne?

03:16:23.981 --> 03:16:25.261
TRAVIS: No.

03:16:25.261 --> 03:16:26.589
LIAM: Does it make ale?

03:16:26.589 --> 03:16:27.702
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:16:27.702 --> 03:16:34.387
LIAM: Pour it out. I walk over to Scanlan, I grab
him by the face and cheeks. Look at this guy! I

03:16:34.387 --> 03:16:39.449
scoop him up and I put him on my shoulders. I walk
over to Keyleth and I say: Look at these fucking

03:16:39.449 --> 03:16:48.575
two! To Scanlan and Keyleth, the two biggest
fucking heroes I know! Yeah!

03:16:48.575 --> 03:16:57.468
TRAVIS: Shit, I'll drink to that! I take the jug
and I stick my face in. I go: Beer! It makes four

03:16:57.468 --> 03:16:59.536
gallons of beer.

03:16:59.536 --> 03:17:07.261
LIAM: And can I just say: Thank you, Scanlan.
Thanks, Keyleth.

03:17:07.261 --> 03:17:12.131
MARISHA: Thank all of us. We did this together!

03:17:12.131 --> 03:17:16.117
SAM: We did do this together, and we didn't do
anything that you wouldn't have done for us.

03:17:16.117 --> 03:17:18.337
TALIESIN: He's going to drink all of the beer if
you don't stop.

03:17:18.337 --> 03:17:20.041
LAURA: Oh, Grog! Share.

03:17:20.041 --> 03:17:21.873
LIAM: Is there anything left?

03:17:21.873 --> 03:17:24.502
MATT: It sloshes a bit. There's enough for half a
cup.

03:17:24.502 --> 03:17:26.612
LIAM: For everybody, or for one?

03:17:26.612 --> 03:17:27.956
MATT: For one.

03:17:27.956 --> 03:17:30.070
LIAM: For one half cup?! Is that all it does?

03:17:30.070 --> 03:17:33.285
TRAVIS: It makes four gallons. I'm a big guy.

03:17:33.285 --> 03:17:35.771
LAURA: I take a teeny sip. Pike, would you like
any ale?

03:17:35.771 --> 03:17:38.240
SAM: We have a wine cellar.

03:17:38.240 --> 03:17:40.763
LIAM: You there, blue fellow!

03:17:40.763 --> 03:17:45.425
SAM: Not a fellow! Not a fellow. A lady.

03:17:45.425 --> 03:17:51.013
LAURA: Pass it down. All right. So should we take
the boys with us, then? Because we're not

03:17:51.013 --> 03:17:52.918
necessarily coming back here?

03:17:52.918 --> 03:18:00.944
MARISHA: I have just enough room in my spell bus
to take us all back.

03:18:00.944 --> 03:18:06.074
LAURA: Well, then I bamf Trinket back in the--
well, I can bamf him back in when we-- I'm going

03:18:06.074 --> 03:18:13.417
to leave him out for a while. Let him stretch it
out. He's been confined for a bit. You did so good

03:18:13.417 --> 03:18:14.896
in that fight!

03:18:14.896 --> 03:18:18.380
MATT: (bear noises) Rubs against you. He seems
pretty proud.

03:18:18.380 --> 03:18:21.191
LAURA: You did better than your mom. Yeah.

03:18:21.191 --> 03:18:22.907
MATT: (bear noises)

03:18:22.907 --> 03:18:27.357
LIAM: I'm going to walk up to the corner. I've
still got Scanlan on my shoulders. I'm going to

03:18:27.357 --> 03:18:36.277
invert my hands and grab him and turn him upside
down. Hey, you know I'm teasing, but you're an

03:18:36.277 --> 03:18:40.254
amazing man. You are a hero.

03:18:40.254 --> 03:18:43.084
SAM: That means a lot, Vax.

03:18:43.084 --> 03:18:45.626
LIAM: I shut him up and I kiss him.

03:18:45.626 --> 03:18:47.311
SAM: Oh, upside-down Spider-man!

03:18:47.311 --> 03:18:52.713
LIAM: Just take it! Take the compliment, you
fucker!

03:18:52.713 --> 03:19:06.912
SAM: Oh! That's not the first upside-down elf man
kiss I've ever had, but it's probably top three.

03:19:06.912 --> 03:19:12.195
LIAM: I go to Scanlan's cheek. (patting, slap)

03:19:12.195 --> 03:19:15.120
SAM: I can't take that much damage!

03:19:15.120 --> 03:19:16.900
LIAM: That's okay, do one for me.

03:19:16.900 --> 03:19:18.733
SAM: (grunts weakly)

03:19:18.733 --> 03:19:21.845
LIAM: I'm going to go find my sister. I'll talk to
you later.

03:19:21.845 --> 03:19:25.964
MATT: That would've been a great Bigby's Hand
moment.

03:19:25.964 --> 03:19:29.346
LIAM: Back out the door.

03:19:29.346 --> 03:19:34.180
MATT: So you guys have gathered your things.
You've gathered your two companions.

03:19:34.180 --> 03:19:40.188
MARISHA: We should probably slave ourselves up
again. We don't have to go far.

03:19:40.188 --> 03:19:42.772
MATT: You still have the illusions.

03:19:42.772 --> 03:19:46.025
LAURA: Oh, you kissed Keyleth in the middle of
that fight!

03:19:46.025 --> 03:19:47.328
LIAM: Absolutely!

03:19:47.328 --> 03:19:49.422
MARISHA: That is weird!

03:19:49.422 --> 03:19:55.112
MATT: You totally kissed your sister.

03:19:55.112 --> 03:19:57.163
TRAVIS: Nasty!

03:19:57.163 --> 03:20:02.003
MATT: And then right now planted one on a flaming,
dark-skinned, bearded fellow.

03:20:02.003 --> 03:20:07.540
LIAM: Yeah. Hey, guys, that's your hangup, not
mine.

03:20:07.540 --> 03:20:10.361
(laughter)

03:20:10.361 --> 03:20:12.932
MARISHA: I feel like I'm learning so much about
you, Vax.

03:20:12.932 --> 03:20:15.527
LIAM: My name is pronounced &lt;i&gt;Liam.&lt;/i&gt;

03:20:15.527 --> 03:20:18.544
(laughter)

03:20:18.544 --> 03:20:24.208
MATT: As you guys gather your things, you make
your way back out into the Thoroughfare of the

03:20:24.208 --> 03:20:29.823
Arches, where you can see there is now a heavier
patrolling guard of Illuminated in the vicinity.

03:20:29.823 --> 03:20:32.170
MARISHA: We put our chains back on.

03:20:32.170 --> 03:20:36.961
LAURA: I walk up to Percy before we put our
horrible chains back on, and I grab his hand, and

03:20:36.961 --> 03:20:40.150
I give him a peck on the cheek and whisper: Thank
you.

03:20:40.150 --> 03:20:45.366
TALIESIN: You're welcome. And yes, that was weird
for me, too. Just weird right now.

03:20:45.366 --> 03:20:46.693
LAURA: Just a peck.

03:20:46.693 --> 03:20:48.282
TALIESIN: Yes, thank you, but it's weird.

03:20:48.282 --> 03:20:56.294
LIAM: After my bit with Scanlan, I put the ring
back on and spend the next 20 minutes attuning to

03:20:56.294 --> 03:21:01.894
it, and she hears behind her: (mocking) Oh, thank
you. I love you so much.

03:21:01.894 --> 03:21:03.295
LAURA: I go (grunts).

03:21:03.295 --> 03:21:05.263
MATT: You get an elbow right to the stomach.

03:21:05.263 --> 03:21:07.727
LIAM: No, she's got to roll for it with
disadvantage because I'm invisible!

03:21:07.727 --> 03:21:11.115
MATT: She's grown up with you. She knows exactly
where you are going to whisper into her ear.

03:21:11.115 --> 03:21:17.381
LIAM: (mocking) Your hair is so white and
beautiful. I'm so in love.

03:21:17.381 --> 03:21:19.824
LAURA: Go away.

03:21:19.824 --> 03:21:21.652
LIAM: (mocking) You're a shithead!

03:21:21.652 --> 03:21:29.390
MATT: As you guys begin to make your way,
backtracking to the location of Juuraiel's

03:21:29.390 --> 03:21:37.865
building... without incident. Though there are a
few tense moments of you guys staying in the

03:21:37.865 --> 03:21:43.140
public eye, you've watched how other people walked
about the city, the lack of communication from

03:21:43.140 --> 03:21:49.487
folks that don't seem to be on the upper echelon,
and avoiding as much of the Illuminated as you

03:21:49.487 --> 03:21:52.989
can, with their flaming amulets.

03:21:52.989 --> 03:22:00.116
Eventually, you find your way back to the large
slowly spiraling black-and-gold abode of Juuraiel.

03:22:00.116 --> 03:22:05.746
The door has the same knob on the front. You
knock. The door is lifted and the two fire giant

03:22:05.746 --> 03:22:14.610
slaves greet you and lead you into the home. There
across the way on the other side of her large

03:22:14.610 --> 03:22:20.154
desk, still waiting, arms crossed, fingers
intertwined, you see grinning the ever opulently

03:22:20.154 --> 03:22:25.974
dressed Juuraiel. Waiting for you all to approach
quietly, with a smile on her face. Her eyebrows

03:22:25.974 --> 03:22:32.470
tensed and furrowed, expecting either a sweet
victory or word of a sweet defeat. Either way, she wins.

03:22:32.470 --> 03:22:38.619
TALIESIN: We have the necklace.

03:22:38.619 --> 03:22:43.221
MARISHA: I take out the necklace and throw it at
her feet. Or on the table in front of her.

03:22:43.221 --> 03:22:51.231
MATT: She reaches down and plucks it; it dangles.
She looks at it. "So it is done, then?"

03:22:51.231 --> 03:22:56.569
MARISHA: If word has not reached you by now,
honestly, I'm quite surprised.

03:22:56.569 --> 03:23:01.060
TRAVIS: I'm not. We were super stealthy as
requested.

03:23:01.060 --> 03:23:02.201
LAURA: Yeah, we were.

03:23:02.201 --> 03:23:04.272
MARISHA: Word of mouth. It's a small city.

03:23:04.272 --> 03:23:07.754
TALIESIN: Died in disgrace, as well. Plot to
overthrow the sultan.

03:23:07.754 --> 03:23:10.195
LIAM: A disembodied voice says: Totally.

03:23:10.195 --> 03:23:25.000
MATT: You can see the brow unfurls ever so
slightly, and a look of peace washes over her face

03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:29.821
for a moment. She takes the small amulet in her
hand and clutches her fingers around it and closes

03:23:29.821 --> 03:23:43.418
her eyes. "You've done me a great service this
day, and you have upheld your end of the bargain.

03:23:43.418 --> 03:23:51.694
"For this, I thank you." She pulls a drawer open in
the desk and plops it in, slams it shut. (slam) "I

03:23:51.930 --> 03:23:59.012
"absolve you of the ownership I have against you.
My servants will collect your necklaces. Thank

03:23:59.012 --> 03:24:04.509
"you. Thank you very much."

03:24:04.509 --> 03:24:08.312
LAURA: Thank you for the plate mail, as well.

03:24:08.312 --> 03:24:17.106
MATT: "Yes. My apologizes. It's been a long day."
She reaches up and takes the armor pieces there

03:24:17.106 --> 03:24:21.372
and sets it on the edge of the desk.

03:24:21.372 --> 03:24:25.975
SAM: Just curious, what do you say we play one
hand?

03:24:25.975 --> 03:24:27.592
TALIESIN, LAURA, and TRAVIS: No!

03:24:27.592 --> 03:24:29.336
SAM: Oh, okay. All right.

03:24:29.336 --> 03:24:31.537
MARISHA: I think you've done enough gambling for
today.

03:24:31.537 --> 03:24:32.910
ASHLEY: Just for funsies.

03:24:32.910 --> 03:24:40.172
MATT: "Now, the deal is done. Get out."

03:24:40.172 --> 03:24:42.107
LAURA: Goodbye. Thank you.

03:24:42.107 --> 03:24:48.876
MARISHA: Would you care if we do a little
teleportation spell in your living room?

03:24:48.876 --> 03:24:52.379
MATT: "I would recommend doing it towards the
foyer door."

03:24:52.379 --> 03:24:55.416
MARISHA: Right, because you've got-- thank you.

03:24:55.416 --> 03:25:01.039
LAURA: Thank you. Do you want to put it on now,
Pike?

03:25:01.039 --> 03:25:03.375
MARISHA: (chanting) Put it on!

03:25:03.375 --> 03:25:06.541
LIAM: We came all this way.

03:25:06.541 --> 03:25:08.059
ASHLEY: Well, okay.

03:25:08.059 --> 03:25:13.516
MATT: Okay, so you guys help her get out of her
armor. The fire giant's awkwardly watching from a

03:25:13.516 --> 03:25:15.292
distance as she's down to her skivvies.

03:25:15.292 --> 03:25:17.523
SAM: I'm going to hold up a towel.

03:25:17.523 --> 03:25:20.225
MATT: Well, she doesn't have to get fully naked in
here. She's not naked under the armor. There's

03:25:20.225 --> 03:25:21.916
padding and stuff.

03:25:21.916 --> 03:25:24.600
TRAVIS: She's Pike. She's hardcore. I don't know.

03:25:24.600 --> 03:25:31.734
MATT: That'd be painful as shit. Pinches
everywhere. But the plate, which is about human

03:25:31.734 --> 03:25:35.567
size, it's too large for Pike, and it gets loose
when you get inside of it. It's hanging off of

03:25:35.567 --> 03:25:39.941
her. Once you get the last piece of the armor on,
she looks like a child wearing her parents'

03:25:39.941 --> 03:25:41.929
clothing.

03:25:41.929 --> 03:25:43.255
TRAVIS: Perfect.

03:25:43.255 --> 03:25:53.049
MATT: And then, with a creaking sound, all armor
snaps to her form, and you watch as the beautiful

03:25:53.049 --> 03:25:59.426
brass scrolling across the armor itself begins to
brighten. You can see bits where the scrolling

03:25:59.426 --> 03:26:05.902
glows with this pulsing, almost internal fire, and
the rubies gleam. And you see the air around her

03:26:05.902 --> 03:26:12.412
begin to distort, like the air distortion over a
hot flame.

03:26:12.412 --> 03:26:17.034
LAURA: Oh my gosh! Oh jeez!

03:26:17.034 --> 03:26:19.713
SAM: We've got to read it to you.

03:26:19.713 --> 03:26:22.593
LAURA: And you got rubies all over you and stuff!

03:26:22.593 --> 03:26:25.041
LIAM: Well, completionists, we fucking did it.

03:26:25.041 --> 03:26:27.412
MARISHA: Legendary weapons!

03:26:27.412 --> 03:26:30.092
ASHLEY: Aw, I can't really read it.

03:26:30.092 --> 03:26:32.221
SAM: Laura will read it in Ashley's voice.

03:26:32.221 --> 03:26:34.375
MATT: Yeah, Travis. Read it in Ashley's voice.

03:26:34.375 --> 03:26:38.190
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Oh, beautiful brass
scrolling and priceless--

03:26:38.190 --> 03:26:39.629
ASHLEY: All right, that's a little--

03:26:39.629 --> 03:26:42.123
(laughter)

03:26:42.123 --> 03:26:46.675
LAURA: Beautiful brass scrolling and priceless cut
rubies adorn this silver set of amor.

03:26:46.675 --> 03:26:48.575
TRAVIS: Don't read the whole thing.

03:26:48.575 --> 03:26:49.933
LAURA: No?

03:26:49.933 --> 03:26:51.633
TRAVIS: It's up to Ashley if she wants to.

03:26:51.633 --> 03:26:52.782
LAURA: Oh. Well, okay.

03:26:52.782 --> 03:26:54.406
SAM: Are we going to text it to Ashley to read?

03:26:54.406 --> 03:26:55.967
TRAVIS: She's getting it right now.

03:26:55.967 --> 03:27:00.491
SAM: Okay, text it to Ashley. This is the speed of
internet.

03:27:00.491 --> 03:27:02.847
LAURA: Ashley can read it out loud, if you want
to.

03:27:02.847 --> 03:27:06.215
TALIESIN: Faster than a speeding Loot Crate.

03:27:06.215 --> 03:27:18.247
ASHLEY: Not to be greedy, milady, but what's the
story with that ruby shield?

03:27:18.247 --> 03:27:21.541
(laughter)

03:27:21.541 --> 03:27:24.308
MATT: You start walking up wearing the armor you
just won and ask her this question?

03:27:24.308 --> 03:27:31.229
ASHLEY: I feel like it matches. That's my only
reason I'm asking.

03:27:31.229 --> 03:27:37.806
MATT: Both of her hands reach up over the desk,
because you can barely see her from your vantage

03:27:37.806 --> 03:27:43.369
point, you're so small by comparison. Both of her
hands reach over, grasp the edge, and she leans

03:27:43.369 --> 03:27:51.349
forward, looming over you, her large grinning dark
skin, vibrant red hair, braided, adorned with

03:27:51.349 --> 03:28:04.014
jewels and metallic bands of platinum. She leans
down. "It is not for you to worry about. Now,

03:28:04.014 --> 03:28:09.465
"leave me to my collection. You've already taken
one from me."

03:28:09.465 --> 03:28:17.262
ASHLEY: Well, it wasn't taken from you. Okay,
thank you so much.

03:28:17.262 --> 03:28:19.854
(laughter)

03:28:19.854 --> 03:28:22.617
TRAVIS: You look awesome, Pike.

03:28:22.617 --> 03:28:23.988
LAURA: You look amazing, Pike.

03:28:23.988 --> 03:28:29.279
TRAVIS: Is it actually hotter in that armor? Are
you sweaty in there?

03:28:29.279 --> 03:28:31.782
MATT: It's actually very comfortable and quite
cool.

03:28:31.782 --> 03:28:34.692
SAM: Can you read what it says, Ashley?

03:28:34.692 --> 03:28:37.872
LAURA: Is it quieter than her other mail?

03:28:37.872 --> 03:28:39.061
MATT: No.

03:28:39.061 --> 03:28:40.876
(laughter)

03:28:40.876 --> 03:28:42.709
ASHLEY: It's still loud?

03:28:42.709 --> 03:28:44.822
MATT: It's still pretty loud.

03:28:44.822 --> 03:28:45.876
ASHLEY: Should I read it?

03:28:45.876 --> 03:28:47.289
SAM: Yes, please, read it.

03:28:47.289 --> 03:28:55.235
ASHLEY: Okay. Beautiful brass scrolling and
priceless cut rubies adorn this silver set of

03:28:55.235 --> 03:29:02.770
armor. Worn by the high priest Duana of Pelor as
she fell in the battle of Ghor Dranas. While

03:29:02.770 --> 03:29:06.547
wearing this armor, you gain a plus-three bonus to
AC?!

03:29:06.547 --> 03:29:08.560
TRAVIS: Oh, that's not the best part.

03:29:08.560 --> 03:29:10.151
TALIESIN: What? It gets better!

03:29:10.151 --> 03:29:15.145
ASHLEY: You cannot be frightened, and you gain
resistance to fire damage, and when you are struck

03:29:15.145 --> 03:29:20.791
by a melee attack, the attacker suffers 2d6 points
of fire damage!

03:29:20.791 --> 03:29:25.061
TALIESIN: It gets better!

03:29:25.061 --> 03:29:30.016
ASHLEY: If you are knocked unconscious by an
attack or spell, a blast of healing flame

03:29:30.016 --> 03:29:37.069
surrounds you. You immediately regain five hit
points and are lifted to your feet! All harmful

03:29:37.069 --> 03:29:44.560
creatures within 15 feet of you must make a
dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 fire damage,

03:29:44.560 --> 03:29:49.549
half damage on a success, and once you've used
this ability you cannot use it again until the

03:29:49.549 --> 03:29:50.750
next dawn.

03:29:50.750 --> 03:29:55.257
SAM: What?! So if someone kills her, they hurt
more.

03:29:55.257 --> 03:29:58.778
LIAM: She bounces back from death one time a day.

03:29:58.778 --> 03:30:00.460
MATT: From unconsciousness, yeah.

03:30:00.460 --> 03:30:02.228
TALIESIN: Unconsciousness one time a day.

03:30:02.228 --> 03:30:04.171
TRAVIS: If they hit her, they take damage.

03:30:04.171 --> 03:30:06.762
LAURA: If she goes unconscious, they get blasted.

03:30:06.762 --> 03:30:09.368
SAM: Holy shit.

03:30:09.368 --> 03:30:11.700
TALIESIN: That's nuts.

03:30:11.700 --> 03:30:15.416
ASHLEY: Oh man.

03:30:15.416 --> 03:30:17.349
TRAVIS: That is amazing.

03:30:17.349 --> 03:30:19.174
ASHLEY: What the heck.

03:30:19.174 --> 03:30:20.974
MATT: It's a good Vestige.

03:30:20.974 --> 03:30:23.089
MARISHA: That's amazing.

03:30:23.089 --> 03:30:25.097
LAURA: Guys, we got all the Vestiges!

03:30:25.097 --> 03:30:27.538
MARISHA: We got all of our legendary weapons.

03:30:27.538 --> 03:30:29.551
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: That we know of.

03:30:29.551 --> 03:30:33.967
SAM: What happens if we all put them together? Do
we become Voltron?

03:30:33.967 --> 03:30:36.003
LAURA: Let's go home and do that.

03:30:36.003 --> 03:30:37.507
MARISHA: Okay, let's go home.

03:30:37.507 --> 03:30:40.141
SAM: Let's try to stack ourselves into some sort
of weird pyramid.

03:30:40.141 --> 03:30:43.528
MATT: All right. So.

03:30:43.528 --> 03:30:45.153
LAURA: Wait, are we going home or are we going--

03:30:45.153 --> 03:30:46.881
MARISHA: To Fort Daxio?

03:30:46.881 --> 03:30:48.238
LAURA: Or should we go home first?

03:30:48.238 --> 03:30:49.140
TRAVIS: Daxio.

03:30:49.140 --> 03:30:51.115
SAM: Do we need to check in with creepy guy?

03:30:51.115 --> 03:30:52.396
MARISHA: We can come back for him.

03:30:52.396 --> 03:30:53.856
SAM: Really? We don't need to check in?

03:30:53.856 --> 03:30:57.275
MARISHA: I gave him a bracelet. He knows where we
are.

03:30:57.275 --> 03:31:01.062
SAM: I don't want him coming for us. Don't we owe
him something?

03:31:01.062 --> 03:31:03.010
LAURA: Yeah, but we can't take care of it right
now.

03:31:03.010 --> 03:31:08.964
MARISHA: I gave him the bracelet so he knows where
to find us. As soon as we kill Thordak, we'll come

03:31:08.964 --> 03:31:10.572
back and make good on our word.

03:31:10.572 --> 03:31:14.211
LIAM: Yeah, if we survive, we'll send him a Jelly
of the Month club membership.

03:31:14.211 --> 03:31:20.214
SAM: This does not seem like a good idea. If we
are in mid-Thordak battle and he shows up to

03:31:20.214 --> 03:31:21.681
collect, we're fucked!

03:31:21.681 --> 03:31:24.673
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'd button it up.

03:31:24.673 --> 03:31:35.337
MARISHA: Well, if we go back, though, what if he
wants to cash in right now? I gave him the

03:31:35.337 --> 03:31:37.049
bracelet. Deliberately.

03:31:37.049 --> 03:31:42.770
TRAVIS: I don't think that meant we're going to
leave the Fire Plane before we settle the favor

03:31:42.770 --> 03:31:46.410
that he &lt;i&gt;constantly&lt;/i&gt; reminds that we owe him.

03:31:46.410 --> 03:31:51.221
LIAM: Look, we didn't have the time to come here,
period, so let's go talk to him and ask him if we

03:31:51.221 --> 03:31:54.043
can have a few days to get back to him. If we die,
problem solved.

03:31:54.043 --> 03:31:56.521
LAURA: He'd make us owe him another fucking
favor.

03:31:56.521 --> 03:31:59.869
TALIESIN: May I also recommend that we leave the
children out of that room?

03:31:59.869 --> 03:32:04.110
MARISHA: Yeah, remember, we're dragging children
everywhere we go.

03:32:04.110 --> 03:32:07.115
SAM: Can you send those children back?

03:32:07.115 --> 03:32:08.784
TRAVIS: The mansion is still up, isn't it?

03:32:08.784 --> 03:32:10.968
LAURA: No, but we'd have to walk all the fuck
back!

03:32:10.968 --> 03:32:18.996
MARISHA: Look, he mentioned, "Let me give you a
trinket in case you all leave so I can find you again."

03:32:18.996 --> 03:32:20.144
SAM: In case.

03:32:20.144 --> 03:32:21.689
MARISHA: But he's expecting it.

03:32:21.689 --> 03:32:26.884
TRAVIS: Yeah, but then we put it in his court when
he shows up. Favors.

03:32:26.884 --> 03:32:31.570
ASHLEY: Is it a bad idea to just be like: We're
all done. We just got to go do a thing. You know

03:32:31.570 --> 03:32:33.796
where we are. We'll be right back.

03:32:33.796 --> 03:32:38.731
MARISHA: All right. I guess we can talk to him.
I'm just afraid he'll try and cash in on it right

03:32:38.731 --> 03:32:40.192
now and not let us leave.

03:32:40.192 --> 03:32:46.275
SAM: Then we'll settle this. We don't want Garth
from Wayne's World to have anything on our heads.

03:32:46.275 --> 03:32:51.797
LIAM: Also, we're mostly nice people, but I'm
pretty sure Grog could crush him like an

03:32:51.797 --> 03:32:58.319
accordion. We're not going to do that, but we can
set the terms of the favor a little bit.

03:32:58.319 --> 03:33:00.676
LAURA: All right. Then let's fucking go!

03:33:00.676 --> 03:33:02.028
TRAVIS: Let's go get Senokir.

03:33:02.028 --> 03:33:03.192
LIAM: All right.

03:33:03.192 --> 03:33:04.771
MARISHA: How far of a walk is it?

03:33:04.771 --> 03:33:12.055
MATT: I'd say, with you guys not having a guide
and trying to go off memory in coasting through,

03:33:12.055 --> 03:33:15.979
it'll take you a little over an hour, but you do
find it.

03:33:15.979 --> 03:33:17.270
MARISHA: All right.

03:33:17.270 --> 03:33:24.736
MATT: The establishment you now see from the other
side. There are three different types of languages

03:33:24.736 --> 03:33:28.013
written above the top. One of them is Common; it
says "Flame Garden," and that is the name of his

03:33:28.013 --> 03:33:37.666
jeweler's business. As you guys come to the front
doors, which are actually open for business, there

03:33:37.666 --> 03:33:43.016
are no customers in there at the moment, and you
see Uten in the back is currently working on some

03:33:43.016 --> 03:33:51.919
sort of a crafting circumstance, has a heavy
jeweler's visor-type setup with a number of

03:33:51.919 --> 03:33:57.390
magnifying circular glasses set up, and is
currently grinding something small against a

03:33:57.390 --> 03:34:01.619
piece. You see Senokir is off in the corner,
currently going through papers, and as you guys

03:34:01.619 --> 03:34:14.216
step inside, he glances over. "So. Hello. It's
good to see you so soon. Can I help you?"

03:34:14.216 --> 03:34:22.815
TALIESIN: We're about to head home, and we want to
make sure that you know that we have not forgotten

03:34:22.815 --> 03:34:28.890
that we're indebted to you and that we plan, quite
possibly if it's amenable, about contracting you

03:34:28.890 --> 03:34:32.170
for services in the future, as well, in your more
common field.

03:34:32.170 --> 03:34:44.658
MATT: "That could very well be amenable. I am glad
you returned, for if you are on your way, this

03:34:44.658 --> 03:34:54.064
"would be a good a time for me to ask for your
favor." He turns around and goes behind an area

03:34:54.064 --> 03:34:58.281
and moves a couple of things around. You seem to
hear the clicking of something unlocking.

03:34:58.281 --> 03:35:00.157
LAURA: If you want some autographs--

03:35:00.157 --> 03:35:13.844
MATT: "No need. But you're sweet" And he pulls out
a small, dark box. It's about this big.

03:35:13.844 --> 03:35:15.516
MARISHA: What's in the box?

03:35:15.516 --> 03:35:17.642
(laughter)

03:35:17.642 --> 03:35:28.159
MATT: "Here. I want you to take this and do me a
favor. This will consider our debt cleared, yes?"

03:35:28.159 --> 03:35:30.440
TALIESIN and LAURA: What is it?

03:35:30.440 --> 03:35:40.124
MATT: "This box contains the ashes of my late wife
Zaafin. I've kept them for years and had been

03:35:40.124 --> 03:35:46.620
"intending to make a trip to Vasselheim and bury it
beneath the Birthheart in the Abundant Terrace

03:35:46.620 --> 03:35:55.490
"where she once lived, toiled as a girl. I would
hope that you do this, and I will consider our

03:35:55.490 --> 03:35:56.818
"pact complete."

03:35:56.818 --> 03:36:01.412
SAM: That's it? What a nice, sweet man!

03:36:01.412 --> 03:36:03.244
MARISHA: I think we misjudged him.

03:36:03.244 --> 03:36:05.864
TRAVIS: It would be an honor.

03:36:05.864 --> 03:36:08.676
LAURA: Can I roll an insight check?

03:36:08.676 --> 03:36:11.340
MATT: (laughs) Sure, go ahead.

03:36:11.340 --> 03:36:13.228
TALIESIN: It's not like it's going to help.

03:36:13.228 --> 03:36:16.943
LAURA: Just to see. No, not a natural 20.

03:36:16.943 --> 03:36:19.200
MATT: This is your night, Laura.

03:36:19.200 --> 03:36:21.323
LAURA: This is not my night.

03:36:21.323 --> 03:36:24.480
ASHLEY: Can I roll an insight check?

03:36:24.480 --> 03:36:25.817
MATT: Sure.

03:36:25.817 --> 03:36:27.514
TALIESIN: I like him.

03:36:27.514 --> 03:36:30.730
TRAVIS: "Sure." Better be a 40 or higher.

03:36:30.730 --> 03:36:32.866
ASHLEY: 18.

03:36:32.866 --> 03:36:45.343
MATT: 18. He's hard to read. By his nature,
everything is even-keeled and strange. You can't

03:36:45.343 --> 03:36:48.131
keep rolling insight until somebody gets a
ridiculous number!

03:36:48.131 --> 03:36:49.599
TRAVIS: Well, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; can, because it was a four.

03:36:49.599 --> 03:36:50.886
MATT: Good. Great.

03:36:50.886 --> 03:36:54.118
LAURA: Is this the size of the ashes, the box?

03:36:54.118 --> 03:36:59.945
MATT: I'd say, it's about eight inches by eight
inches, and about maybe four inches high.

03:36:59.945 --> 03:37:02.364
SAM: Matt, I just got a four insight check, as
well.

03:37:02.364 --> 03:37:11.308
MATT: Okay, cool. You're all very confused. "Well,
I appreciate both meeting you all."

03:37:11.308 --> 03:37:14.024
SAM: Where exactly would you like us to put
these?

03:37:14.024 --> 03:37:15.501
TRAVIS: Vasselheim.

03:37:15.501 --> 03:37:23.735
MATT: "The Birthheart. Bury it where the nature's
roots touches the soil. She'd like that."

03:37:23.735 --> 03:37:27.943
TRAVIS: I do hate to pry, but how long ago did
your wife pass?

03:37:27.943 --> 03:37:36.988
MATT: "This would have been four years, two
months, six days--"

03:37:36.988 --> 03:37:41.030
ASHLEY: Why is it important to bury it there?

03:37:41.030 --> 03:37:43.923
MATT: "It's where she grew up as a girl."

03:37:43.923 --> 03:37:46.815
TRAVIS: You have our condolences.

03:37:46.815 --> 03:37:49.532
LAURA: And a promise. It will be done.

03:37:49.532 --> 03:37:51.236
MATT: "Good."

03:37:51.236 --> 03:37:55.267
LIAM: Family and history are important.

03:37:55.267 --> 03:37:56.546
MATT: "Indeed."

03:37:56.546 --> 03:37:57.649
LAURA: Okay.

03:37:57.649 --> 03:37:58.958
MATT: "Thank you."

03:37:58.958 --> 03:38:00.380
TALIESIN: Let us be off, then.

03:38:00.380 --> 03:38:09.833
MARISHA: If you ever find yourself in the Material
Plane and need a tour guide--

03:38:09.833 --> 03:38:12.429
LAURA: Hey, Senokir, do you have any fire
potions?

03:38:12.429 --> 03:38:15.447
MATT: "Hold on, I'm conversing. What were you
saying?"

03:38:15.447 --> 03:38:21.395
MARISHA: Just, you know where to find us. I gave
you that bracelet.

03:38:21.395 --> 03:38:25.116
MATT: "Yes, indeed."

03:38:25.116 --> 03:38:27.510
TALIESIN: You'll most likely be hearing from us,
as well.

03:38:27.510 --> 03:38:29.282
MATT: "Thank you."

03:38:29.282 --> 03:38:32.509
LIAM: Wait. Percy?

03:38:32.509 --> 03:38:35.290
TALIESIN: Yes. He does quite good work.

03:38:35.290 --> 03:38:37.654
LIAM: Do you need a commission?

03:38:37.654 --> 03:38:40.737
TALIESIN: I may have a thing. I'm giving it some
time.

03:38:40.737 --> 03:38:45.174
LIAM: Time? It was just yesterday or two days ago
at the most that you said you needed it.

03:38:45.174 --> 03:38:50.106
TALIESIN: I'm working on a commission. It's going
to be lovely. It's going to be a surprise.

03:38:50.106 --> 03:38:52.610
TRAVIS: Not anymore. You're saying it in front of
all of us.

03:38:52.610 --> 03:39:07.232
TALIESIN: All right, fine. If we survive this,
we're going to have killed five dragons, so what a

03:39:07.232 --> 03:39:13.915
lovely thing it would be to have something built
from the scales of five dragons. We would be the

03:39:13.915 --> 03:39:18.362
only people on the plane to be adorned with the
scales of five dragons.

03:39:18.362 --> 03:39:23.098
SAM: Are you talking about fingerless gloves made
of dragonscale?

03:39:23.098 --> 03:39:25.276
TALIESIN: Yes, that's exactly-- and Ray-Bans.

03:39:25.276 --> 03:39:29.088
LIAM: Not what I was expecting, but I like it.

03:39:29.088 --> 03:39:37.648
TALIESIN: I think if we survive this, I
think we all should be given something beautiful.

03:39:37.648 --> 03:39:39.893
LAURA: Some emblem?

03:39:39.893 --> 03:39:42.291
TALIESIN: Also, perhaps adorn the castle with a
few of them, as well.

03:39:42.291 --> 03:39:46.252
LIAM: Well, this is a good place to start. This is
above average here. It's a whole other dimension.

03:39:46.252 --> 03:39:49.553
TALIESIN: I love his work. We'll be in touch.

03:39:49.553 --> 03:39:51.127
MATT: "Very good."

03:39:51.127 --> 03:39:55.764
MARISHA: We have your card. We're good. Yeah, we
know.

03:39:55.764 --> 03:39:57.576
MATT: "All right. Well, I'll be here."

03:39:57.576 --> 03:40:05.772
ASHLEY: Oh, what was your wife's name? Do you want
us to put a marker there or anything like that?

03:40:05.772 --> 03:40:07.130
MATT: "Zaafin."

03:40:07.130 --> 03:40:08.939
SAM: Zaafin?

03:40:08.939 --> 03:40:11.665
LAURA: Got it.

03:40:11.665 --> 03:40:17.730
LIAM: As one last thank you to him, since I'm
still invisible, I make moose antlers behind my

03:40:17.730 --> 03:40:19.253
sister's head and go--

03:40:19.253 --> 03:40:23.831
MATT: (quiet laughter)

03:40:23.831 --> 03:40:26.599
TRAVIS: That's what I wanted. One last laugh.

03:40:26.599 --> 03:40:30.627
MATT: "Thank you so much. Stay safe."

03:40:30.627 --> 03:40:32.901
LAURA: Thank you, Senokir.

03:40:32.901 --> 03:40:37.054
(laughter)

03:40:37.054 --> 03:40:39.332
MATT: He turns around and goes back to his paper.

03:40:39.332 --> 03:40:45.415
MARISHA: Wait, Senokir, before you do that, is it
safe for us to teleport out of here? You won't mind?

03:40:45.415 --> 03:40:47.622
MATT: He's just going through his papers, not
paying attention.

03:40:47.622 --> 03:40:48.825
MARISHA: Okay.

03:40:48.825 --> 03:40:50.220
TRAVIS: Yeah, just do it.

03:40:50.220 --> 03:40:51.367
MARISHA: Let's go.

03:40:51.367 --> 03:40:53.090
MATT: All right, where are you guys going?

03:40:53.090 --> 03:40:56.834
MARISHA: Fort Daxio? Yeah. We all join hands with
the kids.

03:40:56.834 --> 03:40:58.382
SAM: Oh yeah, the kids.

03:40:58.382 --> 03:41:02.094
LAURA: Oh, I bamf Trinket back in my necklace so
that we have enough.

03:41:02.094 --> 03:41:03.689
MARISHA: It's one big fatty spell.

03:41:03.689 --> 03:41:04.978
SAM: Nine? Okay.

03:41:04.978 --> 03:41:09.318
MARISHA: Me and eight. So let's go! (teleporting
sounds)

03:41:09.318 --> 03:41:15.570
MATT: All righty. You all concentrate, focus
yourselves, clasping your hands together,

03:41:15.570 --> 03:41:21.783
concentrating on the Prime Material Plane.
Keyleth, with the memory of Fort Daxio before you,

03:41:21.783 --> 03:41:29.650
you grab out your tuning fork component, your
focus that you use for the spells to consider the

03:41:29.650 --> 03:41:35.346
plane. You find yourselves suddenly shift once
more, the air almost escaping your lungs as that

03:41:35.346 --> 03:41:41.083
cold sensation grasps your torso and you feel like
you're being thrust through a doorway. Suddenly,

03:41:41.083 --> 03:41:46.986
it comes back and the warmth hits you once again
of the sunlight. You open your eyes, and you're

03:41:46.986 --> 03:41:58.247
standing in the Othendin Pass once more. Though
not as you left it. There are billowing clouds of

03:41:58.247 --> 03:42:05.363
black in the air around you. You hear the shouts
in the distance as the fort itself is currently

03:42:05.363 --> 03:42:11.753
under siege. You see what appears to be dozens of
flying creatures currently swooping in and

03:42:11.753 --> 03:42:16.212
attacking. Most of the landscape here has been
recently charred or burned. The bits of scrubland

03:42:16.212 --> 03:42:19.343
that you see have been burned to small ashy
cinders.

03:42:19.343 --> 03:42:27.054
Fort Daxio is in the process of falling. And
that's where we're going to go ahead and pick up

03:42:27.054 --> 03:42:28.823
next Thursday.

03:42:28.823 --> 03:42:33.905
SAM and LAURA: Consequences.

03:42:33.905 --> 03:42:35.755
LIAM: And cows.

03:42:35.755 --> 03:42:38.454
SAM and TALIESIN: Consequences and cows.

03:42:38.454 --> 03:42:41.571
LAURA: Man, maybe we shouldn't have gone back to
Senokir.

03:42:41.571 --> 03:42:48.237
MARISHA: How long were we gone? Do you have any
rough estimate?

03:42:48.237 --> 03:42:49.878
TRAVIS: How long was I gone?

03:42:49.878 --> 03:42:51.961
MARISHA: How long was I out for, man?

03:42:51.961 --> 03:42:56.294
MATT: With the full rest you took to prepare for
your encounter with the pit fiend and the

03:42:56.294 --> 03:43:01.892
travelling to and from, probably close to two
days. Anyway, we'll pick that up next week.

03:43:01.892 --> 03:43:03.741
LIAM: Two weeks from now.

03:43:03.741 --> 03:43:06.214
MATT: Oh, two weeks. Yeah, that's right. Two weeks
from now, because Thanksgiving.

03:43:06.214 --> 03:43:08.103
MARISHA: Oh god, yeah.

03:43:08.103 --> 03:43:12.130
MATT: Congrats on getting all your known Vestiges,
guys!

03:43:12.130 --> 03:43:15.890
LIAM: Let's all be thankful for Vestiges and
thankful for being alive.

03:43:15.890 --> 03:43:17.516
ASHLEY: We have all the Vestiges!

03:43:17.516 --> 03:43:19.368
LAURA: And we're not dead.

03:43:19.368 --> 03:43:25.106
SAM: Daxio really needed a restart anyway. We can
plan our attack from somewhere else.

03:43:25.106 --> 03:43:27.468
MARISHA: How many people did we gather?

03:43:27.468 --> 03:43:31.053
MATT: You sent out and notified a number of
individuals.

03:43:31.053 --> 03:43:33.458
LAURA: But it's only been a day and a half, so
nobody has got here yet.

03:43:33.458 --> 03:43:40.177
MARISHA: I hope so. I hope we didn't put all of
our eggs in one basket and then burn the omelet. Yeah.

03:43:40.177 --> 03:43:44.023
SAM: Hey, guys, we're here to save your fort.
We're going to just step away for two days.

03:43:44.023 --> 03:43:47.524
(laughter)

03:43:47.524 --> 03:43:49.050
SAM: Bye!

03:43:49.050 --> 03:43:50.609
MATT: True Vox Machina.

03:43:50.609 --> 03:43:53.154
LIAM: You're going to do great.

03:43:53.154 --> 03:43:55.044
MARISHA: Thanks for coming!

03:43:55.044 --> 03:43:57.301
MARISHA, SAM, and TRAVIS: Bye!

03:43:57.301 --> 03:44:04.176
MATT: Regardless, guys, great job tonight. We'll
see you guys back here in a couple weeks. Some of

03:44:04.176 --> 03:44:11.780
us will be here next Tuesday for Talks Machina.
It's here on Twitch and Alpha. Yeah.

03:44:11.780 --> 03:44:13.603
TALIESIN: Playlist on Friday.

03:44:13.603 --> 03:44:15.543
MATT: Yeah, playlist on Friday, tomorrow, from
Keyleth.

03:44:15.543 --> 03:44:20.157
LAURA: Is the next playlist still going to go up
the day after Thanksgiving, or is that going to be

03:44:20.157 --> 03:44:21.552
two weeks from now?

03:44:21.552 --> 03:44:22.933
SAM: Well, one's going up tomorrow.

03:44:22.933 --> 03:44:28.306
LIAM: I think we should go ahead and do it. Give
them something to tide them over.

03:44:28.306 --> 03:44:31.905
TRAVIS and LAURA: (singing) Let's give them
something to talk about!

03:44:31.905 --> 03:44:35.480
SAM: We're also doing a Thanksgiving costume
contest.

03:44:35.480 --> 03:44:37.624
(laughter)

03:44:37.624 --> 03:44:42.718
LAURA: Oh, and those winners, those are going out
this weekend to the winners, just so you guys know.

03:44:42.718 --> 03:44:48.392
MATT: All the costume winners, you'll be getting
your stuff soon. Thank you guys so much. Much

03:44:48.392 --> 03:44:55.858
love, and is it Thursday after next Thursday yet?
Happy Thanksgiving, guys!

03:44:55.858 --> 03:52:03.172
