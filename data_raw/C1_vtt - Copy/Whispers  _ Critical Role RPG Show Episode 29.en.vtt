00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to this
evening's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.772
of us voice actors get together and roll dice like
we're awesome nerd people, which we are. So,

00:00:09.772 --> 00:00:13.994
welcome! We're going to do a couple quick
announcements here before we kick things off. You

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:15.083
want to go ahead and start?

00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:19.462
ZAC: Yeah, I'm that guy that you can't wait to
stop talking so the show can get started. So guys,

00:00:19.462 --> 00:00:26.966
last week we hit 516 on the sub-train. Okay? And
each week, in theory, should grow by itself

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:34.088
because re-subs count. So basically, if we break
516 and make a new record, we will do a giant

00:00:34.088 --> 00:00:42.139
giveaway which includes everything from Heroclix
to Steam keys to D&amp;amp;D schwag, books from Felicia,

00:00:42.217 --> 00:00:47.887
all sorts of stuff. It will be a giant box of
wonderful Geek and Sundry-related stuff. So that

00:00:47.887 --> 00:00:54.674
is if we break 516, so there's a reason to keep
that train alive, guys. We are also very close to

00:00:54.674 --> 00:00:59.114
hitting 10k. We are like 160 away from reaching
10,000 subscribers.

00:00:59.114 --> 00:01:08.375
How many? 154 away from hitting 10k. Now you
guys may remember #noshavetil10k. I have not. If

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.710
we hit 10k, right when we hit, a straw poll will
be released into the chatroom, and you guys get to

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.289
vote on what my face gets shaved into for the next
week of programming on G&amp;amp;S. And it is very

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.364
unfortunate that that's how we're going to do it.
So tomorrow night on Gather Your Party, it will be

00:01:26.415 --> 00:01:30.262
Stef and Jessica's birthday, we're going to be
throwing a birthday party, and I'm going to let

00:01:30.262 --> 00:01:34.534
them shave my face in whatever you guys vote on,
as a birthday present to them.

00:01:34.534 --> 00:01:36.163
MARISHA: So many things.

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:38.616
MATT: The possibilities are endless.

00:01:38.616 --> 00:01:42.700
ZAC: Just saying that out loud honestly hurts me.
A lot.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.594
MATT: It is thick, too. You can get some nice
dimension in there.

00:01:44.594 --> 00:01:45.943
ZAC: Great.

00:01:45.943 --> 00:01:47.677
LIAM: Words, shave words in--

00:01:47.677 --> 00:01:49.896
TALIESIN: You could build a bear in the beard.

00:01:49.896 --> 00:01:51.431
ZAC: I could build a bear. Yeah. Great.

00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:55.950
MATT: Can we shave off bits and then re-apply them
to other parts of the face?

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.267
ZAC: If you want to wear them, yeah!

00:01:57.267 --> 00:01:58.591
MATT: Okay! I might do that, yeah.

00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:04.478
ZAC: And then this weekend, Nerdist is running a
24-hour livestream for Extra Life. You guys may

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:08.837
recognize some of the faces that stop by. They are
going to be streaming from our set. So, let's

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:12.843
welcome them. We'll be hosting it, but I encourage
you guys all to head over to Nerdist,

00:02:12.843 --> 00:02:19.354
twitch.tv/nerdist. This weekend it'll be Saturday
from 9AM to 9PM Pacific Standard Time. I will be

00:02:19.354 --> 00:02:23.302
there the whole time helping out, as well as some
of our other Geek and Sundry hosts. So you guys

00:02:23.302 --> 00:02:28.452
should check that out and help them be part of our
team, raising money for Extra Life. And Matt, I

00:02:28.452 --> 00:02:31.913
wanted to thank you for helping us make Battle of
the Bands a success last week. We all know that

00:02:31.913 --> 00:02:35.959
the voting was rigged and that's why your team
won, but it was a valiant effort nonetheless. And

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.222
if you guys enjoyed that, you should tweet at Geek
and Sundry's twitter and let them know, and we

00:02:41.222 --> 00:02:44.841
will try to do things like that for you more in
the future. That's pretty much all I have. Let's

00:02:44.841 --> 00:02:47.425
get to 10k and get this stupid stuff off my face.

00:02:47.425 --> 00:02:53.967
MATT: Thank you very much, Zac. Speaking of
shaving, let me take a moment here to mourn the

00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:59.292
Mercer-beard. Those who saw on twitter. I was
trying to hold off until 10k and Halloween for my

00:02:59.292 --> 00:03:05.414
costume, but due to work, had to shave it as of
last night. So, I apologize. I'm in mourning. So

00:03:05.414 --> 00:03:11.467
please bear with me for this evening, going
forward. Couple announcements. Critical

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:18.359
Role-related: we have a lot of our party in
transit right now. Laura and Travis just flew in

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.380
from Toronto and will probably be a little bit
late to the game. Sam is currently heading here

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.736
from a session and will get here as soon as
possible. Unfortunately, Orion will not be joining

00:03:27.736 --> 00:03:32.514
us again this evening, but hope to have him back
next week for Halloween. So, things will get

00:03:32.514 --> 00:03:37.795
rolling as they arrive. Thankfully, we're at a
situation in the game where I don't think it'll be

00:03:37.795 --> 00:03:47.610
too halting. We shall see. Next announcement,
we're putting out Critical Role thematic

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.371
playlists. All the players have put together
playlists of Spotify songs that they feel

00:03:53.371 --> 00:03:58.792
encapture aspects of their character and their
character's journeying as Vox Machina and in the

00:03:58.792 --> 00:04:05.532
world of Exandria. So those will be releasing
every week, starting tonight at 8PM with Percy, I

00:04:05.532 --> 00:04:10.120
believe. So Taliesin's playlist will be up
available on Geek and Sundry's website and--

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.297
TALIESIN: Dropping mad jams-- I'm not.

00:04:12.297 --> 00:04:15.547
MARISHA: They're mad, you're allowed.

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.818
TALIESIN: I'm going to show you some music.

00:04:17.818 --> 00:04:23.624
MARISHA: It's good. Go download Spotify right now,
so you can go, if you haven't. It's free!

00:04:23.624 --> 00:04:24.647
MATT: There you go.

00:04:24.647 --> 00:04:27.995
TALIESIN: It's cancer. It's been a weird
weeknight.

00:04:27.995 --> 00:04:29.488
MARISHA: It has. It's been a long day.

00:04:29.488 --> 00:04:32.420
TALIESIN: I had a strange day. I've infected
friends with Spotify now.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:39.863
MATT: As you should. Infecting friends is fun.
Couple other things. For those who haven't seen it

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:48.059
already, the D&amp;amp;Diesel videos went up earlier this
week, where we had the wonderful chance-- for me,

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.001
at least-- to Dungeon Master for a half an hour
for Vin Diesel, along with Travis and Laura, and

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:59.996
Jessica and Dan of Nerdist ilk. Had a great time,
so hopefully you liked it, and if you'd like to

00:04:59.996 --> 00:05:03.312
see more stuff like that, hopefully we'll have
more things coming up in the future in that vein,

00:05:03.312 --> 00:05:09.276
because we had a good time. Also, along with that,
I released my Witch Hunter class, which was a

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:15.722
customized 5th edition class that I designed after
I ran that game, based on the character I created

00:05:15.722 --> 00:05:24.397
for Vin. It went up on the website, untested.
Feedback is always welcome, and I will be updating

00:05:24.397 --> 00:05:30.145
it on the website as feedback comes in and
balancing is tweaked for it. But have at it, have

00:05:30.145 --> 00:05:36.677
fun, hope you guys enjoy it. I had a good time
creating it, and it's a good time. Also, just a

00:05:36.677 --> 00:05:41.313
reminder to you guys: our official Critical Role
t-shirts are available on the Geek and Sundry

00:05:41.313 --> 00:05:46.315
website store if you want to wear any of the
awesome red shirts that we've shown on the show

00:05:46.315 --> 00:05:53.410
with our full-on Critical Role logo. Shown in an
exemplary dark, fine ink. Those are available for

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.407
purchase.

00:05:54.407 --> 00:05:55.408
MARISHA: And keychains.

00:05:55.408 --> 00:05:59.698
TALIESIN: What if, due to some strange third-arm
syndrome, I can't wear t-shirts; is there any way

00:05:59.698 --> 00:06:01.381
I can show my support to the show?

00:06:01.381 --> 00:06:06.354
MATT: Yes, you can. We have necklaces and
keychains with our logo as well. Also available on

00:06:06.354 --> 00:06:08.060
the store. So, you're welcome to check those out.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.689
TALIESIN: With my third arm, I need necklaces and
keychains.

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:11.833
LIAM: Three-armed shirts are coming in 2016.

00:06:11.833 --> 00:06:14.798
MATT: Yeah, three-armed shirts will be on the
docket. Thank you, Liam,

00:06:14.798 --> 00:06:16.063
I was trying to get to that.

00:06:16.063 --> 00:06:19.895
MARISHA: There's a new shirt up. I didn't know
that.

00:06:19.895 --> 00:06:21.608
MATT: We have a new shirt up?

00:06:21.608 --> 00:06:23.719
OFFSTAGE: How do you want to do this.

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:28.399
MATT: We have it up?! This is good news to know.
We have now up on the store our official "How do

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:34.340
you want to do this" shirt as well. So you can go
check that out on the shop. Prepare for the

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:39.489
holiday season with your Christmases and your
Chanukahs and your Critmases and all that fun

00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:45.268
stuff to make people look as nerdy as we are.
Which is I think part of my goal, personally,

00:06:45.268 --> 00:06:46.382
through world domination.

00:06:46.382 --> 00:06:48.850
(laughter)

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.359
MATT: Maybe not Liam. Everyone but Liam can look
weird. There's no way to help you.

00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:56.727
LIAM: Can I just interject for a second only
because I'm hot as hell. I just want to thank

00:06:56.727 --> 00:07:02.001
@pupgames on twitter for making me this fabulous
stealthy cloak. I'm going to take it off in about

00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:08.233
two minutes, because it's more t-shirt weather
here in the studio. So I'll just let everybody

00:07:08.233 --> 00:07:12.354
bask in the glow of my absence of light for two
minutes, and then I'm going

00:07:12.354 --> 00:07:13.919
to switch to t-shirt mode.

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:15.232
TALIESIN: You're so stealthy.

00:07:15.232 --> 00:07:16.564
MARISHA: Where'd Liam go?

00:07:16.564 --> 00:07:19.939
MATT: It's mysterious.

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.010
MARISHA: Holy shit.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:26.497
MATT: All righty. Also, our cast interviews on the
Geek and Sundry website are almost over. Orion's

00:07:26.497 --> 00:07:30.068
went up today and those will be finishing up
shortly.

00:07:30.068 --> 00:07:32.392
MARISHA: But we have Spotify lists to replace
them.

00:07:32.392 --> 00:07:33.840
MATT: Yep, Spotify lists coming up.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.217
MARISHA: So there's still more content.

00:07:35.217 --> 00:07:38.164
MATT: If you've missed any of the cast interviews,
they're all available on the website. So feel free

00:07:38.164 --> 00:07:39.186
to check them out.

00:07:39.186 --> 00:07:40.240
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.865
MATT: Marisha, you wanted to follow up on the
826LA news you had.

00:07:43.865 --> 00:07:50.781
MARISHA: Yes. 826LA, they're in a campaign right
now for-- let me try to get all this right-- for

00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:59.731
LA 2050 which is a big contest that's sponsored by
Goldhirsh, right now, and it's all for sponsoring

00:07:59.731 --> 00:08:06.561
education and a brighter future for Los Angeles.
So 826LA and Young Storytellers are actually

00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:12.322
partnering together, and they're in this contest
right now. You have to go vote, and they could

00:08:12.322 --> 00:08:24.074
potentially win $100,000. Which: awesome. And
we've got Critters. I think they'll win. So you

00:08:24.074 --> 00:08:31.387
have to go vote. I tweeted the link, so the mods,
go find it on my twitter, or you can just search

00:08:31.387 --> 00:08:37.322
#LA2050, and you should be able to find it. So,
yeah, go vote.

00:08:37.322 --> 00:08:41.078
MATT: Team Hooman, Critters, come up there and
make this happen.

00:08:41.078 --> 00:08:48.122
MARISHA: Also, they just announced they're going
to be opening an 826LA-- sorry, not 826LA, but an

00:08:48.122 --> 00:08:49.439
826 in San Francisco!

00:08:49.439 --> 00:08:50.527
MATT: Awesome!

00:08:50.527 --> 00:08:51.825
TALIESIN: Another 826 in San Francisco?

00:08:51.825 --> 00:08:53.173
MARISHA: Oh, is there another, I guess so.

00:08:53.173 --> 00:08:55.211
TALIESIN: Yeah, because there's one there--

00:08:55.211 --> 00:08:56.316
MARISHA: They might be opening a second one.

00:08:56.316 --> 00:08:57.478
TALIESIN: They might be opening-- that would make
sense.

00:08:57.478 --> 00:08:59.315
MARISHA: I think they said they announced they're
opening one. I think.

00:08:59.315 --> 00:09:00.677
TALIESIN: I'm retweeting you right now.

00:09:00.677 --> 00:09:02.948
MARISHA: Okay. Taliesin's retweeting me.

00:09:02.948 --> 00:09:05.668
MATT: So there you go. Follow either of their
twitters to get the information.

00:09:05.668 --> 00:09:07.222
MARISHA: But, go vote. Help them win 100k.

00:09:07.222 --> 00:09:10.855
MATT: All right, Taliesin, you wanted to mention
something about Tara's--

00:09:10.855 --> 00:09:15.548
TALIESIN: I do! Tara Platt, who is a wonderful
friend of the show and amazing voice actress and

00:09:15.548 --> 00:09:21.038
extremely fabulous in many different ways; she's a
sky pirate, she does all sorts of crazy stuff.

00:09:21.038 --> 00:09:26.231
She's got an Indiegogo for an interactive book
called, and I'm hoping I pronounce this right,

00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:33.769
Zartana. You should check it out, it's really
cool, it's really pretty and beautiful. It's got a

00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:41.169
very Stardust-y vibe. I've already picked up my
copy. So you should go, there's just a couple

00:09:41.169 --> 00:09:45.788
days left, just hop in and grab a copy for yourself.
It's going to be really exciting. And--

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:51.553
MARISHA: Yeah, it's like about a g*psy girl, and
it's got a bunch of recipes, and it teaches you

00:09:51.553 --> 00:09:58.258
how to make a bow, and has herb cards and all
sorts of cool stuff. I was into it immediately.

00:09:58.383 --> 00:10:03.425
TALIESIN: For the cool child in your life this
Christmas. This would be for the kid who needs

00:10:03.425 --> 00:10:06.291
something that's not quite outdoors, but not quite
a video game.

00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:07.201
MARISHA: Zartana.

00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:08.066
TALIESIN: Zartana.

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.127
MATT: There you go.

00:10:09.127 --> 00:10:15.568
TALIESIN: Also, I will be in OniCon in Galveston,
Texas over Halloween. So, if you're in Galveston,

00:10:15.568 --> 00:10:20.199
Texas and it's Halloween, and you want to go to an
anime con, I'll be there. And I'll be in costume,

00:10:20.199 --> 00:10:21.907
and it will be pretty hilarious.

00:10:21.907 --> 00:10:31.125
MARISHA: And last, but not least, last Thursday
while we were here, looking at dead versions of

00:10:31.125 --> 00:10:34.485
ourselves hanging from a tree, Super Power Beat
Down won a Geekie!

00:10:34.485 --> 00:10:37.594
LIAM: Oh! Mazel tov!

00:10:37.594 --> 00:10:46.458
MARISHA: Yeah, glad I came here instead of going
to the award show. Totally worth it. But we won a

00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:48.861
Geekie. So, I thought I should say that.

00:10:48.861 --> 00:10:49.778
LIAM: Well-earned.

00:10:49.778 --> 00:10:50.611
MARISHA: Thanks.

00:10:50.611 --> 00:10:51.612
LIAM: You nerd.

00:10:51.612 --> 00:10:52.563
MATT: Good on you.

00:10:52.563 --> 00:10:57.702
TALIESIN: You should wear it like bling. Get a
chain for it. That'd be great.

00:10:57.702 --> 00:10:59.955
MARISHA: Just, once again, like, it-- No.

00:10:59.955 --> 00:11:01.178
TALIESIN: No. No, never mind.

00:11:01.178 --> 00:11:04.254
MATT: All righty, any other announcements anyone
needs to make?

00:11:04.254 --> 00:11:05.544
TALIESIN: God damn it, it keeps happening.

00:11:05.544 --> 00:11:06.519
LIAM: I'm good.

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:11.671
MATT: All righty. Well then, let us go ahead and
get ourselves tuned in for tonight's episode of

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.440
Critical Role.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:12:22.708
[dramatic music]

00:12:22.768 --> 00:12:27.771
MATT: And welcome back. So, everyone, our Sam
arrived--

00:12:27.771 --> 00:12:30.056
SAM and TALIESIN: Samurai?

00:12:30.056 --> 00:12:33.641
MATT: We have our samurai! Laura and Travis are in
transit, they'll be here as soon as they--

00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:35.506
(thump from Sam's mug)

00:12:35.506 --> 00:12:43.651
MATT: Well played. So. To give us a little
overview of the current story. Two nasty

00:12:43.651 --> 00:12:48.931
individuals known as the Briarwoods, Lord and Lady
Briarwood, have, for the past five years, been

00:12:48.931 --> 00:12:56.752
occupying the city of Whitestone, which was once
the home to Percival here, after it was forcefully

00:12:56.752 --> 00:13:01.178
taken from his family, most of which seemingly
have been either killed or lost in the process,

00:13:01.178 --> 00:13:06.215
and he was scattered to the four winds to find Vox
Machina. After encountering the Briarwoods in Emon

00:13:06.215 --> 00:13:12.004
in a scuffle that took place, the Briarwoods
retreated to Whitestone, inviting the party to

00:13:12.004 --> 00:13:18.146
come and say hello. Since then, the party has
prepared the best they could, made their way

00:13:18.146 --> 00:13:23.364
towards Whitestone, and, through some bit of
infiltration and subterfuge, managed to sneak into

00:13:23.364 --> 00:13:30.008
the city itself. They, under the guise of
Scanlan's Seeming illusion, appeared to be as

00:13:30.008 --> 00:13:35.398
common folk as the rest of the poor saps that
still live in Whitestone. They scoped out an

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:41.869
abandoned tavern, which they fitted to their needs
as a base of operations, and also managed to come

00:13:41.869 --> 00:13:48.260
across a central portion of Whitestone's city
structure and history, known as the Sun Tree, a

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:55.817
tree once risen to the might of the god of the
sun, Pelor, now lies dead in the center of town,

00:13:55.817 --> 00:14:03.074
and from it hung eight figures that appear to have
been individuals killed, hung, and painted up and

00:14:03.074 --> 00:14:08.674
dressed to resemble Vox Machina as essentially a
warning, or a welcome. It's hard to tell when it

00:14:08.674 --> 00:14:13.158
comes to the Briarwoods. Nevertheless, a message
was definitely delivered. The party, retreating

00:14:13.158 --> 00:14:20.658
back to the tavern, set up for the remainder of
the afternoon. Keyleth carved, through her druidic

00:14:20.658 --> 00:14:25.914
magical ways, through the ground to find some of
the roots of the Sun Tree, and began preparing an

00:14:25.914 --> 00:14:31.471
extensive, time-consuming ritual in hopes of
restoring some semblance of life to the entity

00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:41.319
itself. That is where we left off. While the rest
of you have been going about your preparations for

00:14:41.319 --> 00:14:46.948
the rest of the afternoon as this ritual for
Keyleth is an eight-hour ritual and it begun in

00:14:46.948 --> 00:14:52.536
the early afternoon around 2:00, so this will
conclude by around sundown, a little past sundown.

00:14:52.536 --> 00:15:00.791
While she is down there, essentially meditating
with the barren roots of the Sun Tree, is there

00:15:00.791 --> 00:15:03.706
anything you guys would wish to do, or are you
just waiting for her to complete her ritual?

00:15:03.756 --> 00:15:05.592
TALIESIN: Well, there are options.

00:15:05.592 --> 00:15:18.106
SAM: What do we need? We have to get water, right?
There was some issue about-- we don't have any

00:15:18.106 --> 00:15:19.283
water, do we?

00:15:19.283 --> 00:15:20.515
TALIESIN: Was that an issue?

00:15:20.515 --> 00:15:22.364
SAM: I don't remember. There was some wells
around.

00:15:22.364 --> 00:15:32.110
MARISHA: Can I do a few checks while I'm preparing
the ritual to see if this is a

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.525
curse over this tree?

00:15:34.525 --> 00:15:38.887
MATT: Go ahead and make a religion check, I
guess.

00:15:38.887 --> 00:15:50.395
MARISHA: Not great. Hang on, my ring of protection
is in the way. Nine.

00:15:50.395 --> 00:15:59.122
MATT: Nine. Honestly, it's hard to tell if it's a
curse, the tree itself is just dead. You are very

00:15:59.122 --> 00:16:07.596
well-connected with the natural essences of the
world, the life essence of plants and natural

00:16:07.596 --> 00:16:15.367
growth. All of your interactions with the Sun Tree
are devoid of any response. It seems dead where it

00:16:15.367 --> 00:16:19.477
stands. But, as you continue your ritual--

00:16:19.477 --> 00:16:21.485
MARISHA: God, I hope this works.

00:16:21.485 --> 00:16:23.810
MATT: Anyone else have anything they want to do?

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:28.525
LIAM: Well, couple of things. Grog and I were
keeping watch. I forget, one of us was on the

00:16:28.525 --> 00:16:32.845
first floor and one's on the second. I'm just
going to say that I was on the second for now.

00:16:32.845 --> 00:16:39.471
Because I can't remember. It's probably wrong. I'm
going to take all daggers out of my Blinkback Belt

00:16:39.471 --> 00:16:46.962
except for the Keen Dagger and replace them with
wooden stakes that I purchased. And I'm going to

00:16:46.962 --> 00:16:52.290
spend an hour or so, whatever it takes to-- I've
got partial gloves on; I'm going to take that

00:16:52.290 --> 00:17:00.172
symbol of Sarenrae and I'm going to take as much
time as it needs to sew it so that it is fixed

00:17:00.172 --> 00:17:11.032
firmly to the back of my right hand. I tell Grog
that I'm going to go down below and check, and I

00:17:11.032 --> 00:17:15.734
follow the path all the way down to find-- I think
everyone else is down there.

00:17:15.734 --> 00:17:16.943
SAM: Oh hi, Vax.

00:17:16.943 --> 00:17:21.424
LIAM: I step over Scanlan's head and I kneel down
by Keyleth and gently place a hand on her shoulder

00:17:21.424 --> 00:17:24.365
and say: What do you need? What can I get?

00:17:24.365 --> 00:17:33.745
MARISHA: I don't really know. I don't know if this
is going to work, to be totally honest. The tree is

00:17:33.822 --> 00:17:37.230
dead. Do you have any of that holy water?

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:42.705
LIAM: I got holy oil. Not water.

00:17:42.705 --> 00:17:53.706
MARISHA: Do I have holy water? I don't know if I
took one or not. I can't remember.

00:17:53.706 --> 00:17:57.039
MATT: If you didn't write it down, it's not in
your inventory.

00:17:57.039 --> 00:18:03.271
MARISHA: I'm pretty good about that. I don't think
I took one.

00:18:03.271 --> 00:18:05.166
TALIESIN: In the meantime, there are options.

00:18:05.166 --> 00:18:13.358
LIAM: I got two. I remember it. It was two vials
of holy oil. I gave one to my sister, and I have

00:18:13.358 --> 00:18:16.272
the other. If you think it will help, you take
it.

00:18:16.272 --> 00:18:20.866
MARISHA: Okay.

00:18:20.866 --> 00:18:22.675
LIAM: Do you need me to get water?

00:18:22.675 --> 00:18:24.937
MARISHA: Yeah, let's get some water.

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:30.368
MATT: Yeah, because as you guys went through the
tavern, you found there was no actual water. There

00:18:30.368 --> 00:18:38.467
was old ale. There were still a few casks of wine.
Stuff that was abandoned when whoever previously

00:18:38.467 --> 00:18:44.209
was the owner of this tavern either left
Whitestone or fell to a worse fate. But there was

00:18:44.209 --> 00:18:46.283
no plain water to drink.

00:18:46.283 --> 00:18:50.393
LIAM: I'm going to go out into the street. I'm
going to find water.

00:18:50.393 --> 00:18:52.635
TALIESIN: I can show you where there's water.

00:18:52.635 --> 00:18:53.748
SAM: What?

00:18:53.748 --> 00:18:55.242
TALIESIN: I lived here my whole life.

00:18:55.242 --> 00:18:56.724
SAM: Are you guys disguised?

00:18:56.724 --> 00:18:57.893
LIAM: Yeah, we all are.

00:18:57.893 --> 00:19:00.916
MATT: They're still technically under your Seeming
spell, for the next few hours, at least.

00:19:00.916 --> 00:19:04.616
MARISHA: Yeah, we cannot let that go.

00:19:04.616 --> 00:19:08.440
SAM: Does that have a range? No, it just lasts.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.886
MATT: As far as I know, it lasts just for an
eight-hour period. I'll double-check.

00:19:12.886 --> 00:19:15.382
LIAM: Percival, do you want to come upstairs to
the window, and--

00:19:15.382 --> 00:19:16.487
SAM: I'm coming.

00:19:16.487 --> 00:19:18.617
LIAM: Oh, you're coming, too? All right. You're my
son, let's go.

00:19:18.617 --> 00:19:21.028
(laughter)

00:19:21.028 --> 00:19:26.085
MATT: Yeah, it lasts for eight hours and allows
you to change the appearance of--

00:19:26.085 --> 00:19:27.625
SAM: Great. We're still peasants.

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:29.648
MARISHA: Remember, we also have Heroes' Feast up.

00:19:29.648 --> 00:19:30.995
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:19:30.995 --> 00:19:32.387
SAM: Oh, okay.

00:19:32.387 --> 00:19:34.871
MARISHA: Advantages on wisdom throws and whatnot.

00:19:34.871 --> 00:19:36.670
TALIESIN: Hit point bonus, advantage on wisdom
throws--

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:40.133
MARISHA: Yeah. 2d10 hit points. Max hit points.

00:19:40.133 --> 00:19:47.582
TALIESIN: I have my advantages still. So I'm going
to lead them to the closest well.

00:19:47.582 --> 00:19:50.831
MATT: Okay. Stealthily?

00:19:50.831 --> 00:19:55.359
MARISHA: I'm going to start-- I've kind of cleared
out around the roots.

00:19:55.359 --> 00:20:04.526
MATT: It's a lot. It's earth and then giant roots
from a very large tree that go past. You aren't at

00:20:04.526 --> 00:20:08.532
the bottom of the roots. You've met the roots as
you were carving through. They go even deeper than

00:20:08.532 --> 00:20:09.979
where you are right now.

00:20:09.979 --> 00:20:15.654
MARISHA: Yeah. Can I start carving a little ravine
around it for where we're going to start pouring

00:20:15.654 --> 00:20:16.772
the water?

00:20:16.772 --> 00:20:25.406
MATT: If you've already started the eight-hour
process of the secondary spell, you would not be

00:20:25.406 --> 00:20:29.133
able to really interrupt that to be able to
continue another spell you've been doing. I could

00:20:29.133 --> 00:20:32.666
say that you did that as part of your preparation
for the roots. That's fine. That's fine. It'd be a

00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:34.457
small ravine, because you also don't want to--

00:20:34.457 --> 00:20:35.748
MARISHA: Damage anything.

00:20:35.748 --> 00:20:42.436
MATT: You continue your ritual. The rest of you
make your way out the same window that you

00:20:42.436 --> 00:20:49.608
entered, into the alleyway, following Percival.
You lead them to the back of the tavern into one

00:20:49.608 --> 00:20:58.537
of the large alleyways between this chunk of the
city. You find there was a grassy area; most of

00:20:58.537 --> 00:21:06.200
the grass here has turned gray and brittle, as it
is starting to push towards the winter months. And

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:13.980
even for the daytime, the temperature is pretty
chilly. It's probably around 50 or so degrees, 55.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:24.777
Fahrenheit, for our un-American friends.
Eventually, you make your way to the nearest well

00:21:24.777 --> 00:21:28.746
that you've been to. And there is a bucket there.
It looks like it has gathered some dust and some

00:21:28.746 --> 00:21:34.350
cobwebs. You get the bucket, and you let it down,
and eventually it finds its way into the water.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:39.268
It's pretty deep before it hit the water. You
don't know if it's been just, like, water level,

00:21:39.268 --> 00:21:43.910
or if this particular well itself is drying up.
But you manage to get a bucket up, and you pull it

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:51.922
up and check it and it looks clear. You take the
water back with you to the tavern. Seemingly

00:21:51.922 --> 00:21:55.751
uneventful. You guys have managed to stay far
enough out of sight. Nothing seems to caught your

00:21:55.751 --> 00:21:57.291
attention.

00:21:57.291 --> 00:22:05.187
SAM: Okay. Should we scout around and see if
there's anything else around the hideout that we

00:22:05.187 --> 00:22:08.973
should be aware of, or any other hiding places, or
safehouses?

00:22:08.973 --> 00:22:13.183
LIAM: I feel like we should probably bring a
little more water than one bucket. So we should

00:22:13.183 --> 00:22:20.727
spend a little bit of time doing that. But maybe
my sister and I can have a look around, see if

00:22:20.727 --> 00:22:23.184
there's anything that we've missed. Outside.

00:22:23.184 --> 00:22:31.266
TALIESIN: Well, here's the question. There's three
lordly houses that we have to avoid at all costs,

00:22:31.266 --> 00:22:41.777
for now. There's a few shops that if we feel might
be in our best interest to scout out. I know where

00:22:41.777 --> 00:22:49.751
an old weapons depot used to be. We could check
the temples to maybe see if we could maybe find

00:22:49.751 --> 00:22:51.549
some support to begin with.

00:22:51.549 --> 00:22:53.292
LIAM: Do we trust anyone here?

00:22:53.292 --> 00:22:54.865
SAM: We need friends.

00:22:54.865 --> 00:22:58.193
TALIESIN: There might be people I trust.

00:22:58.193 --> 00:23:00.865
SAM: Is there a central meeting place?

00:23:00.865 --> 00:23:02.984
TALIESIN: There's a temple.

00:23:02.984 --> 00:23:09.736
SAM: Is that a place where you can really chat up
brand new people? Or is there a pub? I guess it's

00:23:09.736 --> 00:23:11.483
not really a pub town, is it?

00:23:11.483 --> 00:23:14.569
TALIESIN: It's not a pub town. And it's a place
where you don't necessarily chat up new people,

00:23:14.569 --> 00:23:16.196
but maybe find some old ones.

00:23:16.196 --> 00:23:18.897
SAM: Okay. We could go there.

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:23.821
LIAM: Percival, we're on your turf, so I'll follow
your lead.

00:23:23.821 --> 00:23:31.067
TALIESIN: (sighs) If we have just enough time, I'd
like to try to go to the temple and the cemetery.

00:23:31.067 --> 00:23:36.920
Leave, maybe Grog and Vex to guard Keyleth.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.412
MATT: Okay. So, Keyleth, you're staying behind to
finish the ritual?

00:23:40.412 --> 00:23:43.950
MARISHA: I'm doing what I do best. And I focus all
my energy on this thing.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:51.328
MATT: There are two temples in here. There's the
temple to Pelor, which is known as the Zenith.

00:23:51.328 --> 00:23:52.463
Within the graveyard.

00:23:52.463 --> 00:23:54.336
TALIESIN: Yes, the Zenith is the one I wanted to
go to.

00:23:54.336 --> 00:23:55.737
SAM: What's the other one?

00:23:55.737 --> 00:23:58.844
TALIESIN: The other one is called The Lady's
Chamber. It's a temple of Erathis.

00:23:58.844 --> 00:24:00.115
SAM: That sounds fun.

00:24:00.115 --> 00:24:01.530
TALIESIN: I don't know anybody there.

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:02.850
SAM: I might!

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:06.267
TALIESIN: That's what I'm afraid-- they might know
you, so no.

00:24:06.267 --> 00:24:10.565
MATT: So the Lady's Chamber, the temple to
Erathis, is more central to the city and is

00:24:10.565 --> 00:24:21.340
partially a courtyard, partially a half-dome
amphitheater place of worship. You guys make your

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.700
way through the city. I'll have you all roll
stealth checks if you could.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.985
SAM: We're not trying to hide, are we?

00:24:27.985 --> 00:24:31.348
MATT: Well, if you're not trying to hide, then
make deception checks instead.

00:24:31.348 --> 00:24:35.040
TALIESIN: Awesome possum.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.346
SAM: I rolled an 18 for something.

00:24:37.346 --> 00:24:40.623
LIAM: Can I choose to hide instead of deceive?

00:24:40.623 --> 00:24:41.922
MATT: If you'd like to.

00:24:41.922 --> 00:24:44.002
LIAM: Yeah, I'll hang a little bit back from
them.

00:24:44.002 --> 00:24:45.588
TALIESIN: I was trying to be stealthy, as well.

00:24:45.588 --> 00:24:46.583
MATT: Okay.

00:24:46.583 --> 00:24:48.840
TALIESIN: Although I'm fine either way. 23.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.696
SAM: I'm better deceiving.

00:24:50.696 --> 00:24:52.811
MATT: Okay.

00:24:52.811 --> 00:24:55.391
LIAM: 26.

00:24:55.391 --> 00:25:00.945
MATT: So we have two folks staying to the shadows,
best they can in broad daylight in a clustered

00:25:00.997 --> 00:25:08.127
city. And one child-looking pauper of a boy
wandering through the city alone towards the

00:25:08.127 --> 00:25:17.356
graveyard. As you guys make your way through,
staying off to the side, jumping, or running

00:25:17.356 --> 00:25:23.694
through buildings and staying off the main path,
you walk along the central road to the far eastern

00:25:23.694 --> 00:25:30.332
side of Whitestone. A few folks come out during
the day, some are carrying bundles of textile

00:25:30.332 --> 00:25:34.755
goods. There's one guy that has a small cart, and
it looks like he's bringing tools and stuff either

00:25:34.755 --> 00:25:39.878
to or from a store of some kind. Gives you a
curious look as if he hasn't seen you before but

00:25:39.878 --> 00:25:40.915
doesn't seem to--

00:25:40.915 --> 00:25:42.173
SAM: G'day, sir!

00:25:42.173 --> 00:25:47.311
MATT: "G'day!" And just keeps rolling along, the
wheels squeaking as he pushes up the road.

00:25:47.311 --> 00:25:48.787
SAM: I wish I had a yo-yo.

00:25:48.787 --> 00:25:51.511
TALIESIN: How about a wheel and stick?

00:25:51.511 --> 00:25:54.269
SAM: Oh, the wheel and stick would be good.

00:25:54.269 --> 00:26:02.480
MATT: Eventually, you guys make your way to the
far eastern side of Whitestone. This is where the

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:07.698
boundary wall that surrounds most of the city from
a defensive standpoint lies. There is the multiple

00:26:07.698 --> 00:26:16.222
exit points throughout this wall. You dart around
the outskirts of it, being careful to avoid the

00:26:16.222 --> 00:26:22.477
pattern of the undead giants that are slowly
stomping through the city, like these hulking

00:26:22.477 --> 00:26:29.850
sentinels that walk in a perpetual pattern through
the town. You follow the winding path through the

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:37.970
thick woods, just on the outside of the wall of
the city itself. You sticking to the path in your

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.443
open way, or do you want to join them in the side
of the forest?

00:26:40.443 --> 00:26:45.951
SAM: Well, I've got to stick with them, I guess,
although I like being a young peasant boy. It's

00:26:45.951 --> 00:26:48.781
kind of fun. All right, I'll go with them.

00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:56.834
MATT: All right. So the three of you dart off into
the woods, skirting the outside of the road, but

00:26:56.834 --> 00:27:03.014
making your way following it to the outside of the
graveyard itself. Eventually, you come to the

00:27:03.014 --> 00:27:10.259
outside of the graveyard. Large iron fence that
marks the outside of it. It's rusted from time,

00:27:10.259 --> 00:27:17.805
small spikes mark the very top of it, about six
feet tall, and the gate itself is partially open.

00:27:17.805 --> 00:27:22.516
With a little bit of breeze that's blowing
through, very, very cold breeze that blows through

00:27:22.516 --> 00:27:29.650
this part of the forest, it's opening a little
bit, and (creak) against itself. You push through

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:30.710
the gate--

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:34.230
LIAM: Wait a minute, nope. Let me look. I'm just
going to move in, ten feet ahead,

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.280
and see what I see.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.433
MATT: Okay.

00:27:37.433 --> 00:27:43.008
LIAM: That is a 23 for perception.

00:27:43.008 --> 00:27:50.571
MATT: Okay. You skirt up and look inside. And
there's a handful of trees in little clusters here

00:27:50.571 --> 00:27:59.016
and there, but for the most part this old
graveyard is flat land, with just stones set up

00:27:59.016 --> 00:28:05.602
throughout. The older stones have very little
rhyme or reason to their placement. They're

00:28:05.602 --> 00:28:12.180
sporadically thrown around, fresher ones tend to
be more clustered with family names. This

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:16.294
definitely looks like something that was put here
when the town was founded and has been slowly

00:28:16.294 --> 00:28:19.624
expanded over time, and it's not uniform.

00:28:19.624 --> 00:28:23.479
LIAM: I hiss back at Percy: is this the way to
your temple?

00:28:23.532 --> 00:28:24.647
TALIESIN: (whispers) Yes.

00:28:24.647 --> 00:28:25.701
LIAM: Through here?

00:28:25.701 --> 00:28:26.893
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:28:26.893 --> 00:28:33.591
MATT: You do see, a little ways ahead in the
center of this open barren area, there is a stone

00:28:33.591 --> 00:28:39.258
temple that has, from what little you can see, a
bit of stained glass pattern to it.

00:28:39.258 --> 00:28:44.193
LIAM: Do we knock?

00:28:44.193 --> 00:28:47.583
SAM: Is it safe? Should we go up?

00:28:47.583 --> 00:28:50.173
TALIESIN: We go up to the doors, and give it a
tug.

00:28:50.173 --> 00:28:52.650
MATT: Okay. Percy walks up to the doors.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:54.334
LIAM: Well, all right.

00:28:54.334 --> 00:28:57.892
TALIESIN: This is my neighborhood. I feel
comfortable.

00:28:57.892 --> 00:29:00.391
MATT: Okay. You--

00:29:00.391 --> 00:29:03.295
SAM: All right, Papa, let's go.

00:29:03.295 --> 00:29:13.394
MATT: You go to the doors of the temple, the large
wooden doors. In them are carved this flaming

00:29:13.394 --> 00:29:19.422
wreath into the wood. It looks almost like the
outer ring of the classical depiction of a sun and

00:29:19.422 --> 00:29:24.688
going across the sky where you can see the waving
flames licking the sides of the actual doors. And

00:29:24.688 --> 00:29:34.245
it is a double door. As you tug on the handle at
the front, it gives very little to you. You give a

00:29:34.245 --> 00:29:39.080
little more of a tug on it, not enough to gather
attention, just enough to really see if it's just

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:45.375
stuck, or if it's locked. And it appears that the
doors are not opening.

00:29:45.375 --> 00:29:47.692
LIAM: And I look--

00:29:47.692 --> 00:29:50.003
SAM: This is what he does!

00:29:50.003 --> 00:29:55.173
LIAM: It is what I do. This is an old, old type of
lock, hold on.

00:29:55.173 --> 00:29:56.645
MATT: There is no lock, actually.

00:29:56.645 --> 00:30:00.507
LIAM: There's no lock? Oh, but I rolled a natural
20. Does that help? Let me get through the door?

00:30:00.507 --> 00:30:03.433
TALIESIN: Suddenly, a lock appears! Utterly
pickable!

00:30:03.433 --> 00:30:04.715
(laughter)

00:30:04.715 --> 00:30:07.988
MARISHA: Utterly pickable! It's the most pickable
lock I've ever seen!

00:30:08.059 --> 00:30:15.975
MATT: There is no lock. It is barred from the
other side. There is some heavy wooden plank that

00:30:15.975 --> 00:30:18.994
is currently set on the other side of the door.

00:30:18.994 --> 00:30:20.757
LIAM: Oh, where's Grog when you need him?

00:30:20.757 --> 00:30:26.200
MATT: So, with your expertise in these sort of
circumstances, you know that with the proper

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:31.531
placement of a long blade and enough strength and
weight put at the right fulcrum point, you can

00:30:31.531 --> 00:30:36.423
probably shimmy it off, and it may take a little
bit of teamwork to do so.

00:30:36.423 --> 00:30:40.179
LIAM: Okay who's got a-- mine are all very small.
Do you have a shortsword?

00:30:40.179 --> 00:30:47.259
SAM: Everything I have is short. I can just go in
there and open it from the inside.

00:30:47.259 --> 00:30:52.425
LIAM: Oh, right. I always forget.

00:30:52.425 --> 00:30:57.822
SAM: It's not concentration, so I can just jump in
there.

00:30:57.822 --> 00:30:59.770
MATT: Essentially.

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:02.576
LIAM: Don't fuse with a church pew.

00:31:02.576 --> 00:31:04.949
MATT: If you're referring to a Dimension Door--

00:31:04.949 --> 00:31:07.257
SAM: Correct. It's not concentration, I don't
think.

00:31:07.257 --> 00:31:08.990
MATT: No, it is not concentration.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:10.927
LIAM: More of a sneeze.

00:31:10.927 --> 00:31:16.556
MATT: You can visualize it. It doesn't have to be
a place you have seen yet.

00:31:16.556 --> 00:31:19.577
SAM: I can say I want to go ten feet in that
direction.

00:31:19.577 --> 00:31:20.606
MATT: Yep.

00:31:20.606 --> 00:31:26.458
SAM: Before I do, why are we trying to get in
here? I thought it was to meet people. I don't

00:31:26.458 --> 00:31:27.967
think there's anyone in there.

00:31:27.967 --> 00:31:31.859
TALIESIN: I would like to find out what happened.

00:31:31.859 --> 00:31:33.767
SAM: Okay, good enough for me. I go in.

00:31:33.767 --> 00:31:42.848
MATT: Okay. (spoof) With a burst of dark purplish
energy, Scanlan steps through the door, leaving no

00:31:42.848 --> 00:31:47.589
mark or trace behind. On the other side you hear
this muffled (spoof) as he reappears on the

00:31:47.589 --> 00:31:55.835
opposite side, completing his transition. You
appear now in the central worship hall of the

00:31:55.835 --> 00:32:02.730
Zenith temple. To each side of you, you can see
there are windows, about ten foot wide, stained

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:07.579
glass windows, about every ten feet around this
pattern, it looks like three to each side. There

00:32:07.579 --> 00:32:13.560
are pews set up for the masses to come and sit and
worship, but a lot of the pews have been pushed

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:17.595
off to the side, set astray, some have been
destroyed and ruined. There's a pile in the corner

00:32:17.595 --> 00:32:23.720
of a number of sundered and tattered pews. There
is a red carpet that marks the center that goes

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:31.050
all the way to what looks like a raised altar on
the opposite side of the room. You can see that

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:36.263
some of the stained glass further down has been
shattered and broken, and a little bit of sunlight

00:32:36.263 --> 00:32:45.900
creeps through. You can see there is on the altar
a large stone platform. It's hard to see from this

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.711
distance. Make a perception check.

00:32:47.711 --> 00:32:51.264
LIAM: (muffled) Scanlan! Open the door.

00:32:51.264 --> 00:32:55.427
SAM: We do have earrings. 17.

00:32:55.427 --> 00:33:03.509
MATT: There appears to be something on the the
altar in the distance, small and scattered about

00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:07.673
it, but from this distance, it's hard to make out
the details. But you hear

00:33:07.673 --> 00:33:10.158
Vax muffled through the door.

00:33:10.158 --> 00:33:12.786
SAM: All right, how big is this thing that's
keeping the door shut?

00:33:12.786 --> 00:33:19.447
MATT: It's about eight feet wide and about a
foot-- eight feet long, about a foot wide and

00:33:19.447 --> 00:33:22.052
about six inches thick. A big old piece of wooden
board.

00:33:22.052 --> 00:33:23.150
SAM: A couple hundred pounds?

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:28.968
MATT: I would say it probably weighs about 40 or
50 pounds.

00:33:28.968 --> 00:33:30.201
SAM: 40 or 50 pounds?!

00:33:30.201 --> 00:33:31.463
MATT: It's wood. It's porous.

00:33:31.463 --> 00:33:33.634
SAM: And how high off the ground? Could I touch
it?

00:33:33.634 --> 00:33:37.069
MATT: You could touch it. It gets to about your
head, a little higher.

00:33:37.069 --> 00:33:39.500
SAM: All right. I'm going to try and lift it off.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.578
MATT: Go ahead a make a strength check. Athletics!
Make this athletics.

00:33:42.578 --> 00:33:47.187
SAM: Athletics? Hmm. Not good. 12!

00:33:47.187 --> 00:33:51.624
MATT: (grunting) From this position, it's not even
budging.

00:33:51.624 --> 00:33:58.060
LIAM: All right, Scanlan, step back from the door
a couple of paces. I'm going to stick a blade

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:00.116
through the door.

00:34:00.116 --> 00:34:02.309
SAM: It's not going to do much. There's a big
heavy thing.

00:34:02.309 --> 00:34:08.260
LIAM: I'm going to hold on one side, you're going
to hold on the other, and we'll do it together.

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.060
Percy, can I borrow your blade?

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:13.621
TALIESIN: I've never used this. I've had it since
I created the character and I've never used

00:34:13.621 --> 00:34:21.441
this blade once. This is the most use it's ever
gotten. I pull out this pristine piece of shit

00:34:21.496 --> 00:34:27.774
(laughs) I don't even remember. I think I found it
in a dungeon. It's terrible.

00:34:27.774 --> 00:34:30.384
MATT: What is it?

00:34:30.384 --> 00:34:39.321
TALIESIN: It's a boarding sword, it was one of
those little curved swords.

00:34:39.321 --> 00:34:41.072
MATT: Right. A scimitar or falchion.

00:34:41.072 --> 00:34:44.638
TALIESIN: A scimitar. But short. It was nothing,
it was terrible.

00:34:44.638 --> 00:34:45.731
LIAM: It's all we need.

00:34:45.731 --> 00:34:47.888
TALIESIN: Yeah so. Get it in there.

00:34:47.888 --> 00:34:51.864
LIAM: Scanlan, grab some rags or something, wrap
it around the blade. You're going to lift on your

00:34:51.864 --> 00:34:53.522
side; we're going to lift on this side.

00:34:53.522 --> 00:34:54.830
SAM: I get the sharp side?!

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:57.460
LIAM: I can't get the handle through the crack in
the door.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:02.132
SAM: All right. I feel like there's some sort of
spell I could use.

00:35:02.132 --> 00:35:04.211
All right, let's just do it your way.

00:35:04.278 --> 00:35:06.937
LIAM: Got that Bigby's Hand, is that what you're
saying?

00:35:06.937 --> 00:35:08.542
SAM: Yeah, I've got a million things I could do.

00:35:08.542 --> 00:35:09.885
TALIESIN: Are any of them concentration spells?

00:35:09.885 --> 00:35:15.550
SAM: Bigby's is probably concentration, but I've
also got a potion of strength.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:17.479
MATT: As a note, Seeming isn't concentration.

00:35:17.479 --> 00:35:18.635
SAM: I thought it was.

00:35:18.635 --> 00:35:22.307
MATT: No. You cast it and it lasts for eight
hours. You don't need to worry about that.

00:35:22.307 --> 00:35:24.091
SAM: No, I want to follow this through.

00:35:24.091 --> 00:35:25.631
TALIESIN: Let's keep going.

00:35:25.631 --> 00:35:27.508
LIAM: All right. Can we lift it together?

00:35:27.508 --> 00:35:36.180
MATT: (laughs) We can try. All right, so. This is
going to be the three of you as a skill challenge,

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:41.195
I want all three of you to roll. Not athletics,
just a straight strength roll.

00:35:41.195 --> 00:35:44.124
TALIESIN: One, two, three.

00:35:44.124 --> 00:35:46.774
MATT: Add your strength modifier.

00:35:46.774 --> 00:35:48.023
TALIESIN: 16!

00:35:48.023 --> 00:35:50.668
SAM: Plus strength. 12.

00:35:50.668 --> 00:35:53.741
(laughter)

00:35:53.741 --> 00:35:58.386
SAM: Wait, did you get a four? Four? We are the
worst! We are the weakest ones.

00:35:58.386 --> 00:36:01.151
Oh, I cut my hand!

00:36:01.151 --> 00:36:03.890
MATT: Which is exactly what happens.

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:07.380
TALIESIN and LIAM: Bigby's Hand? Bigby's Hand!

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.158
SAM: I'm going to take damage.

00:36:09.158 --> 00:36:14.061
MATT: Yeah. First and foremost, you take four
points of slashing damage to your hand. You pull

00:36:14.061 --> 00:36:17.470
back, and there is a line of blood now, beginning
to drip off your hand. You shake it amongst

00:36:17.541 --> 00:36:20.428
yourself.

00:36:20.447 --> 00:36:24.973
SAM: Oh, I can't say "God damn it" in here.
I'm in Pelor's-- Sorry, Pelor.

00:36:24.973 --> 00:36:27.440
TALIESIN: Let's use a sword, I want to see how
this plays out.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:34.115
SAM: God bless you. Gesundheit, Pelor. Man, all
right. Well, jeez Louise.

00:36:34.115 --> 00:36:35.892
LIAM: Whip out the purple hand, man!

00:36:35.892 --> 00:36:44.812
SAM: Seems like overkill. What about a
Thunderwave? Can I do that?

00:36:44.812 --> 00:36:46.421
MATT: Certainly.

00:36:46.421 --> 00:36:51.642
SAM: All right. Does it only affect living things?
Or does it affect--

00:36:51.642 --> 00:36:54.795
LIAM: Wait. Scanlan, are there any windows in
there?

00:36:54.795 --> 00:36:59.287
SAM: There are. There are windows. Good call.

00:36:59.287 --> 00:37:04.844
MATT: It's a blast of thunderous energy in an area,
it would affect living and nonliving matter, yes.

00:37:04.901 --> 00:37:06.087
LIAM: Hold on, this is stupid.

00:37:06.087 --> 00:37:07.087
SAM: Are you sure?

00:37:07.087 --> 00:37:09.230
TALIESIN: We are going to the window. We are going
to the window.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:12.261
SAM: No, let's carry this out.

00:37:12.261 --> 00:37:19.357
TALIESIN: No! We are going to the window. Please
do not destroy the temple of Pelor.

00:37:19.357 --> 00:37:21.427
SAM: Three hours later, we are still trying to
open the door.

00:37:21.427 --> 00:37:24.536
MARISHA: It's not even locked. It's just heavy.

00:37:24.536 --> 00:37:30.163
SAM: I can Bigby's Hand. I'll just Bigby's Hand.

00:37:30.163 --> 00:37:31.856
LIAM: Which way to the window? I can walk to the
window.

00:37:31.856 --> 00:37:35.062
SAM: It's up there. You can make it, but Percy
can't.

00:37:35.062 --> 00:37:37.811
LIAM: I can probably lift that door bar from
inside.

00:37:37.811 --> 00:37:40.025
SAM: You could, probably.

00:37:40.025 --> 00:37:41.214
LIAM: With your help, son.

00:37:41.214 --> 00:37:44.086
SAM: Yeah, but I could blast it. Would be very
dramatic.

00:37:44.086 --> 00:37:50.065
LIAM: Let's save that for important stuff. All
right, where is the window? Which way do I go?

00:37:50.065 --> 00:37:52.893
SAM: To the right and up.

00:37:52.893 --> 00:37:57.679
MATT: There are windows shattered on both sides.
They're broken a little higher up. So you could

00:37:57.751 --> 00:38:01.321
either continue to break the bottom part of the
window, or just attempt to leap through the hole.

00:38:01.321 --> 00:38:02.441
LIAM: Yeah, I'll attempt to leap.

00:38:02.441 --> 00:38:04.284
MATT: Okay, so give me an acrobatics check.

00:38:04.284 --> 00:38:05.115
LIAM: All right.

00:38:05.115 --> 00:38:06.385
SAM: The saga of the door!

00:38:06.385 --> 00:38:08.924
MARISHA: It's just a door, you guys! It's just a
door.

00:38:08.924 --> 00:38:09.932
LIAM: 25.

00:38:09.932 --> 00:38:15.998
MATT: 25. You get a running start, leap off the
side and parkour up between the actual-- there is

00:38:15.998 --> 00:38:21.408
an extension to the side where another room is
attached on each side of the temple towards the back.

00:38:21.546 --> 00:38:26.612
You leap off that wall onto the small pillar
that's holding the side of the window and up

00:38:26.736 --> 00:38:31.756
through the broken portion of the stained glass,
landing, three-point landing, on the inside. You

00:38:31.828 --> 00:38:36.820
almost land in one of the shattered piles of
wooden pews and splinters and jagged pieces of wood

00:38:36.871 --> 00:38:42.856
sticking out of it. About a foot away from you,
and you are like, "Oh, that was close." You see

00:38:42.856 --> 00:38:46.178
Scanlan across the way. You see the altar to your
right.

00:38:46.178 --> 00:38:49.312
SAM: Hey! Oi! Your stupid idea cut my hand!

00:38:49.312 --> 00:38:55.903
LIAM: Builds character. I'm going to stay away
from the altar and skirt the wall all the way

00:38:55.903 --> 00:38:56.869
around it.

00:38:56.869 --> 00:38:59.478
Mat: Okay, you get to the door.

00:38:59.478 --> 00:39:01.512
LIAM: I'm going to try to help. Do you want to
help me lift this thing?

00:39:01.512 --> 00:39:02.705
SAM: With my good hand, yes.

00:39:02.705 --> 00:39:05.825
MATT: Have both you guys make strength checks.

00:39:05.825 --> 00:39:15.528
SAM: You know what, I'm going to get some
assistance. I call my Unseen Servant to assist.

00:39:15.528 --> 00:39:17.404
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

00:39:17.404 --> 00:39:18.588
SAM: He is going to lift with us.

00:39:18.588 --> 00:39:24.776
MATT: With a brief burst of wind energy, a
shimmering form, somewhat humanoid in shape, but

00:39:24.776 --> 00:39:26.179
still amorphous appears.

00:39:26.179 --> 00:39:27.349
SAM: Hi, Darrell.

00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:33.977
MATT: (wind sounds) and begins to shove itself up
against the bottom of the wooden bar. Make your

00:39:33.977 --> 00:39:35.852
check, as well.

00:39:35.852 --> 00:39:39.465
SAM: That was a six. Is that for me?

00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:45.069
MATT: That's for you, and then roll and add five
for your Unseen Servant.

00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:50.687
SAM: So, five extra to that is 11. Right? No?

00:39:50.687 --> 00:39:52.041
MATT: Roll again, add five.

00:39:52.041 --> 00:39:56.313
SAM: Oh, I see. Four. So that's a nine.

00:39:56.313 --> 00:40:05.276
MATT: The three of you, one mystically summoned
from a plane beyond your own, cannot seem to budge

00:40:05.338 --> 00:40:12.994
this single wooden door! You've defeated
beholders. You've slaughtered illithid underneath,

00:40:12.994 --> 00:40:19.456
in the Underdark, deep in the belly of the planet.
But this door bests you!

00:40:19.456 --> 00:40:22.332
MARISHA: Man, Laura and Travis ain't missing
shit!

00:40:22.332 --> 00:40:24.225
SAM: All right, I'm doing it. Step back!

00:40:24.225 --> 00:40:25.316
LIAM: Whip out the hand!

00:40:25.316 --> 00:40:31.664
SAM: All right, I summon Bigby's Hand! The
mightiest hand that will ever unlock a door, ever!

00:40:31.664 --> 00:40:34.187
(singing) Bigby's Hand!

00:40:34.187 --> 00:40:42.348
MATT: This giant, glimmering, purple fist appears
in your vicinity. It grabs the bottom. Go ahead

00:40:42.348 --> 00:40:43.728
and roll a d20.

00:40:43.728 --> 00:40:45.458
LIAM: Come on.

00:40:45.458 --> 00:40:46.756
SAM: 12.

00:40:46.756 --> 00:40:47.973
MATT: Plus eight to it.

00:40:47.973 --> 00:40:49.217
SAM: Plus eight? 20!

00:40:49.217 --> 00:40:51.280
TALIESIN: How do you want to do this?

00:40:51.280 --> 00:41:00.267
MATT: With its finger, just goes (ping) and it
(thudding noises). The door (creak) opens up and

00:41:00.267 --> 00:41:02.358
Percy stands there, looking not very happy.

00:41:02.358 --> 00:41:04.245
TALIESIN: Was it overkill? Because really it took
that.

00:41:04.245 --> 00:41:08.314
SAM: It took three spells to open this door! Three
spells!

00:41:08.314 --> 00:41:10.377
TALIESIN: It's not overkill if you used what it
took.

00:41:10.377 --> 00:41:13.234
SAM: Three spells and I injured myself.

00:41:13.234 --> 00:41:22.773
TALIESIN: We took damage from an inanimate object.
Oh god! Get it out of our system now!

00:41:22.773 --> 00:41:24.391
SAM: Welcome, Percy.

00:41:24.391 --> 00:41:32.670
TALIESIN: Oh god! All right, I'm looking around,
taking in the damage. Anything that I notice is

00:41:32.739 --> 00:41:38.692
particularly out of whack from the last time I was
here? Other than they're upgrading the locks,

00:41:38.759 --> 00:41:40.280
apparently.

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:53.624
MATT: Looking about the place, it looks
pseudo-ransacked. There has been much force used

00:41:53.624 --> 00:42:01.068
in whatever destroyed these pews. The glass that
was broken, was broken from the outside in. So,

00:42:01.068 --> 00:42:05.621
definitely seems like there was someone throwing a
rock through, or a intrusion from an outside

00:42:05.621 --> 00:42:12.328
standpoint. As you walk further and look around,
the two rooms to the side, the doors are closed.

00:42:12.328 --> 00:42:17.872
There is the altar on the top, and you do see,
there is a couple of small sacks, laid to the side

00:42:17.872 --> 00:42:26.019
of the altar. What looks to be some low-lit
candles, and there are some braziers. One to each

00:42:26.019 --> 00:42:33.595
side of the altar, and one against each wall. All
of them appear to be long dark and out. Go

00:42:33.595 --> 00:42:35.699
ahead and make a perception check.

00:42:35.761 --> 00:42:36.824
SAM: All of us?

00:42:36.824 --> 00:42:38.193
MATT: All of you.

00:42:38.193 --> 00:42:40.723
SAM: 15.

00:42:40.723 --> 00:42:42.584
TALIESIN: 15.

00:42:42.584 --> 00:42:50.032
MATT: You both, as you approach the far side of
the temple towards the altar, you notice the

00:42:50.032 --> 00:43:02.374
brazier to the right is smoldering ever so gently.
Just a very faint glow of ember to it.

00:43:02.441 --> 00:43:04.006
LIAM: What's the matter?

00:43:04.006 --> 00:43:05.021
TALIESIN: Reynal?

00:43:05.021 --> 00:43:06.363
SAM: Who? Reynal?

00:43:06.363 --> 00:43:17.796
TALIESIN: Father Reynal? (louder) Father Reynal?
Let's check one of the doors. We'll start on the

00:43:17.796 --> 00:43:19.280
door on the right.

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:27.668
MATT: You step up. You can see now, on top of the
altar, there appears to be a couple of glass vials

00:43:27.668 --> 00:43:33.150
that are overturned, a little liquid spilled. You
can see bits of broken glass across the bottom,

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:37.016
the one step that leads down from the altar's
raised platform.

00:43:37.016 --> 00:43:38.750
TALIESIN: Can I dip and smell?

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.744
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:43:40.744 --> 00:43:43.764
TALIESIN: 13.

00:43:43.764 --> 00:43:52.792
MATT: 13? Okay. Looking at just the general
vicinity of the altar. You taste the liquid. It's

00:43:52.792 --> 00:43:58.271
definitely somewhat caustic in nature, you can't
really determine it. But, just touching it to

00:43:58.271 --> 00:44:02.831
your tongue, your tongue goes numb for a second
and you feel a slight burn. Your nostrils clear

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:13.048
out a little bit from the scent. There is some
random powders and such that've been brushed off.

00:44:13.048 --> 00:44:18.673
You get the feeling that the way that all this was
treated, it wasn't so much like it was destroyed

00:44:18.673 --> 00:44:25.613
more than it was hastily packed up. Roll a
perception check.

00:44:25.613 --> 00:44:30.351
TALIESIN: 20.

00:44:30.351 --> 00:44:35.831
MATT: 20? Okay, looking about the outside of the
altar, you do notice that around the brazier that

00:44:35.831 --> 00:44:45.780
is slightly smoldering there is a layer of ash
there, gathered on the inside of the brazier and a

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.756
little bit on the floor, around its base.

00:44:47.756 --> 00:44:51.996
SAM: Okay.

00:44:51.996 --> 00:44:55.088
TALIESIN: Someone has been working on something in
here.

00:44:55.088 --> 00:45:00.017
SAM: It couldn't just be ash from the thing that
is burning?

00:45:00.017 --> 00:45:03.755
MATT: If you look at the other braziers, there is
no ash around it. Most of the ash is contained.

00:45:03.755 --> 00:45:09.916
The wood ash itself tends to fall; it's a little
heavier. This seems to be a lighter shade of ash

00:45:09.916 --> 00:45:15.947
and it's more of a-- has found its way out of the
brazier from just the heat and the air.

00:45:15.947 --> 00:45:21.445
TALIESIN: I want to smell the ash. Does it smell
like some sort of-- is it perfumed?

00:45:21.445 --> 00:45:26.907
MATT: You lean down and you take some of the ash
in your fingers and smell it. It's not perfumed,

00:45:26.907 --> 00:45:33.411
but you've had some experience with dealing with
various burning materials: this is definitely

00:45:33.411 --> 00:45:40.370
paper-based ash. You do also notice underneath the
brazier there is one sliver of paper that was not

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:41.769
wholly burned.

00:45:41.769 --> 00:45:43.480
SAM: Paper.

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.168
MARISHA: (whispering) Paper.

00:45:45.168 --> 00:45:49.134
SAM: It's a golden ticket.

00:45:49.134 --> 00:46:01.490
TALIESIN: "Without sufficient magical essence the
distillation is proven to consistently fail. A

00:46:01.544 --> 00:46:06.408
"shame, really. I shall seek an influx of materials
elsewhere before I can continue this project.

00:46:06.408 --> 00:46:12.710
"Regarding the weapon, after a year of taking notes
from eyewitness accounts, my original designs were

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:19.155
"faulty and recently cost me my hand. The wind of
fortune has seen a shift it seems as Sylas just

00:46:19.155 --> 00:46:24.454
"returned from Emon, having encountered the
still-living subject, and had the pleasure of

00:46:24.454 --> 00:46:30.456
"seeing his work first-hand. His unnatural eyes
took in much detail. I believe his observations

00:46:30.456 --> 00:46:38.195
"have brought me to the brink of finishing my
design. I intend to journey from Whitestone within

00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:42.450
"a couple of months to gather the components
needed. But, if Delilah's hunch is correct, the

00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:47.325
"subject is heading here. I may find myself needing
to leave sooner than anticipated."

00:46:47.325 --> 00:46:50.628
LIAM: They're trying to copy your work.

00:46:50.628 --> 00:46:51.791
SAM: Copy?

00:46:51.791 --> 00:46:55.531
TALIESIN: Why?

00:46:55.531 --> 00:46:59.997
LIAM: For war.

00:46:59.997 --> 00:47:08.176
TALIESIN: I want to take another look at
everything that was on the altar, and I want to

00:47:08.176 --> 00:47:09.676
see if it looks--

00:47:09.676 --> 00:47:12.930
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:15.521
TALIESIN: 18.

00:47:15.521 --> 00:47:20.643
MATT: Testing what's there: I mean, a lot of the
material has been scattered and mixed but there

00:47:20.718 --> 00:47:28.437
are elements that resemble the black powder you've
used in some of your constructs and tinkering in

00:47:28.437 --> 00:47:29.879
the past.

00:47:29.879 --> 00:47:31.317
SAM: They're making guns!

00:47:31.317 --> 00:47:38.828
TALIESIN: Well, we know we're looking for someone
without a hand.

00:47:38.828 --> 00:47:41.082
SAM: To do what?

00:47:41.082 --> 00:47:43.713
TALIESIN: To find out who's trying to copy my
work.

00:47:43.713 --> 00:47:47.510
SAM: Someone who is working with Sylas, right?

00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:50.186
TALIESIN: Yes. Let's check the rest of the
temple.

00:47:50.186 --> 00:47:51.589
LIAM: Yes.

00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:56.210
SAM: Okay, I'm going to go up on the altar. Was
there a small something on the altar?

00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:59.906
MATT: What you noticed were like some of the glass
vials that were overturned.

00:47:59.906 --> 00:48:01.272
TALIESIN: What's in the pouches?

00:48:01.272 --> 00:48:06.302
MATT: Looking at the pouches, it looks like some
of them contained phosphorus, some of them

00:48:06.302 --> 00:48:11.565
contained other alchemical reagents that were used
in the research but most have been emptied, and

00:48:11.565 --> 00:48:13.538
it's just a residuum on the inside.

00:48:13.538 --> 00:48:15.488
TALIESIN: Checking the door on the right.

00:48:15.488 --> 00:48:17.430
MATT: Door on the right.

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:18.642
LIAM: Going with.

00:48:18.642 --> 00:48:29.059
MATT: (creak) Opens up into what was Father
Reynal's room. As the door opens, you're

00:48:29.059 --> 00:48:38.244
immediately hit with terrible smell of decay. And
you can see, shoved under the bed that first

00:48:38.244 --> 00:48:44.901
appears on the opposite side of the small room,
what appears to be the remains of Father Reynal.

00:48:44.901 --> 00:48:49.738
Long passed and left to fester beneath his bed.

00:48:49.738 --> 00:48:51.366
SAM: Can I tell how he died?

00:48:51.366 --> 00:48:54.328
MATT: You're welcome to go ahead and take a look.
Roll an investigation check.

00:48:54.328 --> 00:48:58.533
SAM: 23.

00:48:58.533 --> 00:49:07.549
MATT: 23. Looking at the body, it appears that
there are a series of puncture wounds.

00:49:07.549 --> 00:49:14.340
Rapier-based. They're too long, like stiletto, too
long to be a dagger.

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.701
SAM: Not teeth.

00:49:15.701 --> 00:49:22.423
MATT: No, they are inflicted by a weapon, a long
thin weapon. And multiple to the torso.

00:49:22.423 --> 00:49:26.344
TALIESIN: I'm going to search the room for
anything else. Search the body.

00:49:26.344 --> 00:49:30.885
MATT: Okay. Searching the body, searching the
room, it looks like everything of interest has

00:49:30.885 --> 00:49:39.421
been taken from the place. You find some leftover
stale food, you find some candles that are

00:49:39.421 --> 00:49:45.182
generally used for the purposes of worship here in
the temple, but anything beyond that-- all the

00:49:45.182 --> 00:49:48.904
drawers have been emptied, everything has been
taken by whoever was previously setting up

00:49:48.904 --> 00:49:50.537
residence in this facility.

00:49:50.537 --> 00:49:58.554
SAM: Are there any holy symbols or anything that
we might take to give to Keyleth to, I don't know.

00:49:58.554 --> 00:50:01.909
Wasn't she gonna-- I don't know. Do some
holy shit?

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:09.272
MATT: You do notice that, throughout the temple,
there are images of Pelor, flame-wreathed face,

00:50:09.272 --> 00:50:18.397
various sun and stars that are set up, but most of
them have been profaned, marked on, shattered, or

00:50:18.397 --> 00:50:26.135
covered in soot. An intentional effort has been
made to dampen the power of Pelor in this

00:50:26.135 --> 00:50:27.455
once-holy place.

00:50:27.455 --> 00:50:29.777
LIAM: Are there any untouched?

00:50:29.777 --> 00:50:35.908
MATT: None that are untouched, but there are some
that could possibly be cleaned. A couple of small

00:50:35.908 --> 00:50:38.877
medallions that are hanging up in the room where
the Father lays.

00:50:38.877 --> 00:50:40.712
LIAM: I'll snag those.

00:50:40.712 --> 00:50:41.908
MATT: Okay.

00:50:41.908 --> 00:50:44.827
TALIESIN: I want to check the other room. The room
to the left.

00:50:44.827 --> 00:50:46.432
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:50:46.432 --> 00:50:50.308
TALIESIN: So much perception. 19.

00:50:50.308 --> 00:50:51.526
SAM: 19.

00:50:51.526 --> 00:50:52.541
LIAM: 20.

00:50:52.541 --> 00:50:54.803
MATT: All right. As you walk back into the main
temple--

00:50:54.803 --> 00:50:56.296
MARISHA: Finish. First.

00:50:56.296 --> 00:51:06.263
MATT: All right. Your ears catch a faint, distant
sound like a strong wind pushing through a

00:51:06.263 --> 00:51:13.241
mountain pass. This low mournful wail-type sound.

00:51:13.241 --> 00:51:15.190
SAM: What's that?

00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:18.337
MATT: No wind is moving. There is a stillness to
the air.

00:51:18.337 --> 00:51:21.143
LIAM: Stepping back into the darkest shadows I can
see.

00:51:21.143 --> 00:51:34.307
MATT: As you guys take in this sense, this sound
gets louder and louder. At which point, the air

00:51:34.307 --> 00:51:40.013
itself gets colder and colder. As you nervously
exhale, you can see your breath becoming visible

00:51:40.013 --> 00:51:44.725
in the air around you. As you all look at each
other, you, stepping back into what shadows there

00:51:44.725 --> 00:51:47.236
are, as it is a very open temple, as it's a temple
of sun--

00:51:47.236 --> 00:51:48.792
LIAM: 32 stealth.

00:51:48.792 --> 00:51:53.042
MATT: You find what tiny little alcove you can of
shadow. It's not going to offer a lot of

00:51:53.042 --> 00:51:57.495
protection once you move, but for now
you seem to be out of the circumstance.

00:51:57.495 --> 00:52:00.889
SAM: I grab Percy, and I make us both go
invisible.

00:52:00.889 --> 00:52:02.188
MATT: Okay.

00:52:02.188 --> 00:52:05.446
SAM: So, what is that, a 3rd-level Invisibility
spell?

00:52:05.446 --> 00:52:14.882
MATT: Yeah. You guys both vanish, holding your
place on top of the altar, and as that moaning

00:52:14.882 --> 00:52:21.977
tends to grow louder and louder you can see this
shimmer at the doors that are open on the opposite

00:52:21.977 --> 00:52:31.116
side of the room. It looks like a woman. A form of
a woman, but translucent in nature, drifting in,

00:52:31.116 --> 00:52:44.259
giving off the horrible (raspy groan) sound, as it
drifts in and you see it looking around and the

00:52:44.259 --> 00:52:51.167
features are gaunt as it gets closer. It looks
elven by racial nature, but the eyes are just

00:52:51.167 --> 00:52:58.961
these sunken faintly glowing sockets, the hair
wild and matted and floating behind it, its hands

00:52:58.961 --> 00:53:05.331
reaching out, and as it gets partway through the
temple, it looks like it's seeking something, and

00:53:05.385 --> 00:53:09.416
its eyes fall directly on you two.

00:53:09.416 --> 00:53:12.331
LIAM: I'm throwing a dagger right now.

00:53:12.331 --> 00:53:14.485
MATT: Let's go ahead and--

00:53:14.485 --> 00:53:16.773
SAM: Ugh! What if she was a good guy?

00:53:16.773 --> 00:53:18.278
LIAM: It's a banshee, man.

00:53:18.278 --> 00:53:29.874
SAM: What if it's a good banshee? Some of the
banshees that I've met have been decent. We're

00:53:29.874 --> 00:53:31.020
rolling for initiative?

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:33.260
LIAM: There's Siouxsie and the Banshees, they're
all right.

00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:36.151
SAM: I'm glad I used half my spells trying to get
into this goddamn place.

00:53:36.151 --> 00:53:39.319
MATT: Off to the side there.

00:53:39.319 --> 00:53:40.747
LIAM: He means well.

00:53:40.747 --> 00:53:42.828
TALIESIN: He means well. That's a terrible
costume.

00:53:42.828 --> 00:53:45.622
MATT: You guys are on the altar there.

00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:49.254
TALIESIN: You were so prepared for me to go to the
temple that you built it?

00:53:49.254 --> 00:53:51.966
MATT: I built the whole city, because I didn't
know where you guys were going to go.

00:53:51.966 --> 00:53:53.258
SAM: Jesus, Matt!

00:53:53.258 --> 00:53:55.384
MARISHA: He does have a pile of maps over there.

00:53:55.384 --> 00:53:56.789
MATT Shh! Don't look at it.

00:53:56.789 --> 00:53:58.694
TALIESIN: I'm not looking, I'm not looking.

00:53:58.745 --> 00:54:00.427
MARISHA: I'm just noting the pile.

00:54:00.427 --> 00:54:06.413
MATT: So, first and foremost, let's go ahead and
roll initiative.

00:54:06.413 --> 00:54:08.589
LIAM: Okay.

00:54:08.589 --> 00:54:10.303
MATT: You'll get a surprise round.

00:54:10.303 --> 00:54:11.324
LIAM: Okay.

00:54:11.324 --> 00:54:12.400
MARISHA: Dope.

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.319
LIAM: Natural 20 for initiative, as well.

00:54:15.319 --> 00:54:17.757
MARISHA: You finally got a good initiative roll!

00:54:17.757 --> 00:54:18.968
SAM: I got a seven.

00:54:18.968 --> 00:54:27.240
TALIESIN: I got an 11! Together, we can get a
Slurpee. I'm weird tonight.

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.006
I don't know what's up.

00:54:29.006 --> 00:54:30.302
MATT: All right.

00:54:30.302 --> 00:54:31.779
SAM: Well, I can't do anything.

00:54:31.779 --> 00:54:39.948
MATT: All right, well. First and foremost, before
anything happens, this entity, as it notices your

00:54:39.948 --> 00:54:44.516
presence, it begins to transform and its image
becomes more horrifying. As you pull your dagger

00:54:44.516 --> 00:54:46.801
out, I need all of you guys to roll a wisdom
saving throw.

00:54:46.801 --> 00:54:48.207
MARISHA: You have advantage!

00:54:48.207 --> 00:54:57.877
TALIESIN: I rolled a one and then a natural 20.

00:54:57.877 --> 00:54:59.587
MATT: (laughs) Nice.

00:54:59.587 --> 00:55:00.994
LIAM: 17.

00:55:00.994 --> 00:55:01.895
MATT: 17?

00:55:01.895 --> 00:55:03.224
TALIESIN: Thank you for the advantage.

00:55:03.224 --> 00:55:04.510
MARISHA: You're welcome.

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:05.710
MATT: Scanlan?

00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:06.823
SAM: 11.

00:55:06.823 --> 00:55:07.918
MATT: With advantage?

00:55:07.918 --> 00:55:11.866
SAM: I also always have advantage, so do I get to
roll a third time?

00:55:11.866 --> 00:55:13.750
LIAM: No. Doesn't stack.

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:19.397
MATT: Unfortunately you are considered frightened
by this entity. It scares the crap out of you.

00:55:19.397 --> 00:55:22.461
MARISHA and TALIESIN: You can't be frightened
after a Heroes' Feast.

00:55:22.461 --> 00:55:30.274
MATT: Ah! Then never mind. You feel it shake your
form for a second. Its horrible visual presence,

00:55:30.274 --> 00:55:34.749
for a second, freaks you out, but then you
remember the knowledge that your friends are here

00:55:34.749 --> 00:55:37.228
and you have to serve a purpose and you shake
off--

00:55:37.228 --> 00:55:41.048
SAM: Not only do I shake it off, I gird my loins!

00:55:41.048 --> 00:55:44.848
MATT: Pull them up and get ready. All right.

00:55:44.848 --> 00:55:49.633
MARISHA: Just for a refresher: you're immune to
poison, disease, and fear, and you have advantage

00:55:49.633 --> 00:55:51.046
on your wisdom throws.

00:55:51.046 --> 00:55:52.597
TALIESIN: We should do this every time we fly.

00:55:52.597 --> 00:55:54.596
MARISHA: It's expensive.

00:55:54.596 --> 00:56:02.638
LIAM: So, do I get to attack and then move into
the combat round where I got a natural 20 plus

00:56:02.638 --> 00:56:03.903
five for initiative?

00:56:03.903 --> 00:56:08.944
MATT: Well, you go first. Technically, it's not a
surprise round because the creature can sense life

00:56:08.944 --> 00:56:15.597
and saw them before it happens, so it wasn't
ambushed. But you do get to go first, and you do

00:56:15.597 --> 00:56:19.599
get to go before it. In the use of surprise, I
didn't mean to use it in the surprise round

00:56:19.599 --> 00:56:23.665
fashion. These entities can detect living
creatures up to five miles away.

00:56:23.665 --> 00:56:26.604
LIAM: So, there's no sneak attack damage on this
thing, is there?

00:56:26.604 --> 00:56:29.356
MATT: If you get to it first, you still have
advantage.

00:56:29.356 --> 00:56:30.728
LIAM: All right.

00:56:30.728 --> 00:56:32.751
MATT: Because it doesn't see you. You're still
hidden from it.

00:56:32.751 --> 00:56:34.513
LIAM: 15, so this is a 26 to hit.

00:56:34.513 --> 00:56:35.508
MATT: That hits.

00:56:35.508 --> 00:56:37.901
LIAM: Okay. And this gets the sneak attack
damage?

00:56:37.901 --> 00:56:39.111
MATT: This would, yes.

00:56:39.111 --> 00:56:45.227
LIAM: All right, here we go. But it's not a
critical hit from assassinate because--

00:56:45.278 --> 00:56:46.673
MATT: It is not surprised.

00:56:46.673 --> 00:56:50.505
LIAM: It's not surprised. All right. So, that's a
four plus seven is 11.

00:56:50.505 --> 00:56:58.172
Plus 15, 19, 20, 24, 26, 28?

00:56:58.172 --> 00:56:59.505
MATT: Okay.

00:56:59.505 --> 00:57:10.183
LIAM: I'm just going to keen dagger it three times
in a row. Oh, I've got to roll to attack, so that

00:57:10.183 --> 00:57:13.252
is a twelve plus-- 22?

00:57:13.323 --> 00:57:14.715
MATT: Hits.

00:57:14.715 --> 00:57:27.187
LIAM: Okay. Two, and that is six of damage, and
then natural 20 on that one. That is three, four,

00:57:27.263 --> 00:57:31.395
three, plus seven is ten, so 20 for that, if it's
doubled for a critical hit.

00:57:31.395 --> 00:57:33.338
MATT: For double dice, not doubled modifier.

00:57:33.338 --> 00:57:37.604
LIAM: Oh, all right, so six plus-- 13.

00:57:37.604 --> 00:57:43.497
MATT: Okay, 13, good to know. Awesome. So, out of
the shadows, (whoosh) three daggers strike this

00:57:43.497 --> 00:57:50.336
wailing ghost entity. Each dagger, it punctures,
and you see it reacts from the impact as there's a

00:57:50.336 --> 00:57:55.278
flash of magical energy with each hit. The daggers
then tumble out of its form and then blink back to

00:57:55.278 --> 00:58:00.262
your belt side. It looks like it definitely did
some damage to it, but it's--

00:58:00.262 --> 00:58:05.242
LIAM: You know what, just to be fair, I changed
out all my daggers except for one, so I probably

00:58:05.242 --> 00:58:10.134
couldn't throw the same dagger three times in a
row, so I think should pull back some of the

00:58:10.134 --> 00:58:20.550
modifiers, so I would pull out four, because my
dagger is plus two. So the plus two for two

00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:22.257
of those hits gets taken out, right?

00:58:22.323 --> 00:58:23.456
MATT: It would actually, yes.

00:58:23.456 --> 00:58:24.615
LIAM: So four, minus four.

00:58:24.615 --> 00:58:26.179
MATT: So, minus four damage to this other guy.

00:58:26.179 --> 00:58:27.722
TALIESIN: So truthful.

00:58:27.722 --> 00:58:29.573
SAM: So, we're fighting it with wooden stakes?

00:58:29.573 --> 00:58:33.159
MATT: Wait so you threw wooden stakes at it as two
of the attacks?

00:58:33.159 --> 00:58:35.038
LIAM: I threw one dagger and two wooden stakes.

00:58:35.038 --> 00:58:38.097
MATT: Okay. So, the first dagger hits?

00:58:38.097 --> 00:58:39.500
LIAM: First was the dagger, yeah.

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:46.711
MATT: Yeah. The two other stakes pass through its
form without any other impact. The one dagger does

00:58:46.711 --> 00:58:50.025
return to you, but the two stakes just clatter in
the distance, and the creature seems unharmed by

00:58:50.025 --> 00:58:50.819
those two.

00:58:50.819 --> 00:58:51.931
LIAM: Even though they came out of the belt?

00:58:51.931 --> 00:58:53.157
MATT: Yeah!

00:58:53.157 --> 00:58:54.032
LIAM: All right.

00:58:54.032 --> 00:58:54.975
MATT: Sorry.

00:58:54.975 --> 00:58:56.675
LIAM: It's okay. It's just wood.

00:58:56.675 --> 00:58:57.549
TALIESIN: You learned.

00:58:57.549 --> 00:59:04.276
MATT: So that ends that point. The creature now
swoops up to the center of you three and gives out

00:59:04.276 --> 00:59:11.630
this horrible (roar) this wailing scream that
bursts out in the air, you feel like the wind push

00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:17.124
you back and all of you feel like for a moment
you're staring at your own death. I need all three

00:59:17.124 --> 00:59:19.969
of you guys to roll constitution saving throws.

00:59:19.969 --> 00:59:24.016
SAM: Does our meal help us with that at all?

00:59:24.016 --> 00:59:25.140
MATT: Nope.

00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:26.236
TALIESIN: 11.

00:59:26.236 --> 00:59:28.038
MARISHA: Wait, don't forget you have the
additional--

00:59:28.038 --> 00:59:29.054
LIAM: What?

00:59:29.054 --> 00:59:30.744
MARISHA: 2d10 hit points on top.

00:59:30.744 --> 00:59:32.295
SAM: Okay. 16.

00:59:32.295 --> 00:59:33.912
LIAM: 16.

00:59:33.912 --> 00:59:42.631
MATT: Okay. Both of you guys, you feel this
chilling burst of spiritual energy blast through

00:59:42.672 --> 00:59:52.500
your soul. And you each take 14 points of psychic
damage. Percy, however, as you look at it, it

00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:57.925
seems like this blast actually forces the soul
from your body momentarily. You immediately drop

00:59:57.925 --> 00:59:59.545
to zero hit points and are unconscious.

00:59:59.545 --> 01:00:04.001
SAM: What? No! No, he can't. Oh, god.

01:00:04.001 --> 01:00:13.929
MATT: So with that, you see Percy, eyes roll back
and then collapse onto the floor like a pile of

01:00:14.108 --> 01:00:21.303
cold bones. Out. Percy, it's your turn. Go ahead
and make a death saving throw.

01:00:21.303 --> 01:00:22.322
TALIESIN: 11.

01:00:22.322 --> 01:00:23.592
MATT: 11, okay.

01:00:23.592 --> 01:00:24.915
MARISHA: That's a good sign.

01:00:24.915 --> 01:00:26.079
MATT: Scanlan, it's your turn.

01:00:26.079 --> 01:00:28.868
SAM: Very quickly. Should we flee?

01:00:28.868 --> 01:00:30.518
MARISHA: Get the fuck out.

01:00:30.518 --> 01:00:31.658
LIAM: In a little bit.

01:00:31.658 --> 01:00:33.177
SAM: In a little bit? Okay.

01:00:33.177 --> 01:00:34.184
LIAM: Without Percy?

01:00:34.184 --> 01:00:35.293
MARISHA: Well, get him up.

01:00:35.293 --> 01:00:38.472
MATT: You still have Bigby's Hand, by the way, on
concentration.

01:00:38.472 --> 01:00:39.774
SAM: Oh, that's right!

01:00:39.774 --> 01:00:43.805
MATT: Let's see how long that lasts, actually. Let
me see how long it lasts. Just to be safe.

01:00:43.805 --> 01:00:47.978
TALIESIN: We haven't been there very long.
(whispering) God damn it.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:51.888
MATT: Up to a minute. So probably would have faded
by now.

01:00:51.888 --> 01:00:52.862
SAM: God damn it.

01:00:52.862 --> 01:00:55.977
MATT: Sorry. What are you doing, Scanlan?

01:00:55.977 --> 01:00:58.923
TALIESIN: Really, it's the door's fault.

01:00:58.923 --> 01:01:07.282
SAM: Shit. I'll just Lightning Bolt her. Him. It.
Whatever it is.

01:01:07.282 --> 01:01:12.417
MATT: Okay. So you release a bolt of lightning
energy right in its direction. Go ahead and roll

01:01:12.417 --> 01:01:13.577
damage for that.

01:01:13.577 --> 01:01:14.725
SAM: Oh, just damage?

01:01:14.725 --> 01:01:17.698
MATT: You don't have to hit for lightning bolt; it
just hits everything in front of it, and you have

01:01:17.698 --> 01:01:18.711
to try and avoid it.

01:01:18.711 --> 01:01:19.631
SAM: Oh, 8d6.

01:01:19.631 --> 01:01:21.197
MATT: What's the DC?

01:01:21.197 --> 01:01:23.379
SAM: Do I get my hand cone?

01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:28.870
MATT: It is a free action to pull it out, so you
instinctively-- hand cone, cast the spell-- out

01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:29.894
the bolt goes.

01:01:29.894 --> 01:01:30.701
SAM: So, 19.

01:01:30.701 --> 01:01:31.869
MATT: 19, okay.

01:01:31.869 --> 01:01:33.086
SAM: 8d6.

01:01:33.086 --> 01:01:34.453
MATT: Does not make its saving throw.

01:01:34.453 --> 01:01:35.338
SAM: Great.

01:01:35.338 --> 01:01:37.794
TALIESIN: Need more d6, or are you cool?

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:39.721
SAM: Nope, that's it. I just need help counting.

01:01:39.721 --> 01:01:40.752
MARISHA: That's good!

01:01:40.752 --> 01:01:46.497
SAM: 16, five, 21, 27.

01:01:46.497 --> 01:01:49.373
TALIESIN: 28, 29, 30. 34!

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:50.564
SAM: 34.

01:01:50.564 --> 01:01:55.728
MATT: 34 points of damage. The lightning blasts
through her, not impactful as you think it might

01:01:55.728 --> 01:02:01.116
be. This entity because it is in an ethereal
state, is not as effectively hit by such magics.

01:02:01.116 --> 01:02:02.423
However, it does take damage.

01:02:02.423 --> 01:02:03.649
SAM: Okay.

01:02:03.649 --> 01:02:04.935
MATT: Okay.

01:02:04.935 --> 01:02:18.152
SAM: I will move back a bit. Away from the thing.
And I will-- Oh! We have people.

01:02:18.152 --> 01:02:22.239
MARISHA: Yay! Percy's unconscious!

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:23.428
LAURA: No!

01:02:23.428 --> 01:02:24.783
TRAVIS: Keep fighting!

01:02:24.783 --> 01:02:25.997
MARISHA: It's okay, it's cool.

01:02:25.997 --> 01:02:27.326
LAURA: We've been listening in the car.

01:02:27.326 --> 01:02:28.723
TALIESIN: Okay, so you know.

01:02:28.723 --> 01:02:30.146
MATT: Scanlan, you move back?

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:32.386
SAM: Okay, and then I can, as a bonus action,
still get a bonus?

01:02:32.386 --> 01:02:35.578
I will heal him, this doofus here.

01:02:35.578 --> 01:02:37.124
TALIESIN: I didn't do anything!

01:02:37.124 --> 01:02:38.868
MATT: Healing Word.

01:02:38.868 --> 01:02:45.464
SAM: Okay, yeah. (singing) I'm bring health points
back. Yeah! You mothafuckas don't know how to

01:02:45.464 --> 01:02:49.087
act-- Yeah! That's all I got. (singing) Take it to
the bridge!

01:02:49.087 --> 01:02:52.213
MATT: All right, so Healing Word is 1d4 plus--

01:02:52.213 --> 01:02:55.183
SAM: Yeah, but maybe I should do it at a--

01:02:55.183 --> 01:02:56.626
TALIESIN: Just get me up. It's okay.

01:02:56.626 --> 01:02:59.308
SAM: Just get you up? Okay. 1d4 plus something?

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:00.277
MARISHA: Do it.

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:04.000
SAM: Two plus whatever. Six? Eight?

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.228
MARISHA: I think it's plus your spell level.

01:03:05.228 --> 01:03:06.312
MATT: Healing Word will be--

01:03:06.312 --> 01:03:10.577
SAM: It's 1d4 plus five, so it's seven points.

01:03:10.577 --> 01:03:14.216
MATT: So, seven hit points. You're conscious, but
you're still on the ground, face down, loosely

01:03:14.216 --> 01:03:17.950
fallen over the stuff on the altar.

01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:19.520
TALIESIN: I don't get my turn until next round.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:24.195
MATT: Correct. So, Scanlan? Your turn's done? Vax,
you're up.

01:03:24.195 --> 01:03:30.687
LIAM: All right, so where is it? I'm just going to
back away from it about three steps, while I pull

01:03:30.687 --> 01:03:33.509
Flametongue Dagger out of my cloak.

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:35.428
MATT: Okay. You're in this room currently.

01:03:35.428 --> 01:03:39.979
LIAM: Yeah, oh! That, oh, okay. No. So, I'm going
to walk, thanks. I'm going to slide up the wall

01:03:39.979 --> 01:03:46.403
along where Scanlan is. Towards Scanlan. And
another thing I realized, I haven't clicked my

01:03:46.403 --> 01:03:50.191
Boots of Haste, so I wouldn't have been able to do
whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, anyway. And I'm still not

01:03:50.191 --> 01:03:54.803
going to. But I'm pulling out my Flametongue
Dagger and now I'm throwing Keen Dagger,

01:03:54.803 --> 01:04:00.200
Flametongue. First one is 26.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.240
MATT: Hits.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.443
LIAM: And the second one is 23.

01:04:03.443 --> 01:04:04.401
MATT: Hits.

01:04:04.401 --> 01:04:09.014
LIAM: Okay. First attack gets 11.

01:04:09.014 --> 01:04:10.393
MATT: All right.

01:04:10.393 --> 01:04:13.324
LIAM: And the second attack gets eight.

01:04:13.324 --> 01:04:20.803
MATT: All righty. Both daggers hitting it, you see
its form being impacted by each dagger hit. It

01:04:20.803 --> 01:04:25.004
still continues to come forward toward the two of
you. Is that the end of your movement?

01:04:25.004 --> 01:04:29.623
LIAM: I'm going to, without doing any dash or
anything, because I can't, I'm going to move as

01:04:29.623 --> 01:04:33.898
far as I can just going kitty-corner. Behind
Scanlan, walking along the wall.

01:04:33.898 --> 01:04:34.807
MATT: Over here?

01:04:34.807 --> 01:04:35.911
LIAM: Absolutely.

01:04:35.911 --> 01:04:36.860
MATT: That far?

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:38.954
LIAM: Yeah, that's as far as I can get, that's
good.

01:04:38.954 --> 01:04:46.313
MATT: I think so. All right. That ends your turn.
The creature now is going to drift up to the

01:04:46.313 --> 01:04:52.293
unconscious form, or the now-conscious form of
Percy. It's going to swipe at you with its

01:04:52.293 --> 01:05:00.447
Corrupting Touch. Since you're prone, it has
advantage on the attack. That'll be 20 to hit.

01:05:00.447 --> 01:05:01.774
What's your AC?

01:05:01.774 --> 01:05:02.713
TALIESIN: 18.

01:05:02.713 --> 01:05:08.108
MATT: 18? Okay. As its hand reaches down and
passes through, as you just come to consciousness,

01:05:08.108 --> 01:05:12.111
and you start getting yourself up, you look up
and feel this cold sensation as its hand reaches

01:05:12.184 --> 01:05:15.664
through your back and seems to almost grasp your
spine. Your whole body lurches from the impact.

01:05:15.664 --> 01:05:17.991
You take 12 points of necrotic damage.

01:05:17.991 --> 01:05:19.744
TALIESIN: I'm back to zero.

01:05:19.744 --> 01:05:21.138
SAM: That's two!

01:05:21.138 --> 01:05:23.102
LIAM: It starts over.

01:05:23.102 --> 01:05:24.068
SAM: It does?

01:05:24.068 --> 01:05:25.625
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm back to zero.

01:05:25.625 --> 01:05:29.344
SAM: If he dies once, comes back and dies again,
is that two?

01:05:29.344 --> 01:05:31.399
MATT: No, he has to fail his death saves.

01:05:31.399 --> 01:05:37.369
TALIESIN: I just woke up and went, (groans). Passed
back out again.

01:05:37.369 --> 01:05:42.097
MATT: That ends its turn. Well, no actually, it's
going to start moving now. It's going to drift

01:05:42.097 --> 01:05:49.518
through the rest of its movement this direction.
That ends its turn. Go ahead and make your death

01:05:49.518 --> 01:05:50.978
saving throw.

01:05:50.978 --> 01:05:53.001
TALIESIN: Yes, 19.

01:05:53.001 --> 01:05:54.085
LAURA: Yeah.

01:05:54.085 --> 01:05:55.785
TRAVIS: Yay, little snitch.

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:59.279
MATT: All righty. That ends your turn. Scanlan,
you're up.

01:05:59.279 --> 01:06:01.828
SAM: Hey, should we leave?

01:06:01.828 --> 01:06:05.240
LIAM: No, we should kill this thing!

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.430
SAM: Damn it! All right.

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:10.930
LIAM: We're not going to be able to run. This
thing flew in here on the breeze.

01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:16.729
SAM: I don't think Eyebite's going to work against
it. So, fuck, I'll cast Bigby's Hand

01:06:16.729 --> 01:06:18.119
at 6th-level, then.

01:06:18.119 --> 01:06:20.707
MATT: (laughing) Okay!

01:06:20.707 --> 01:06:21.960
TRAVIS: Has that ever been done?

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.711
SAM: I don't have any more 5th-level slots. So,
I'm just going to make it even bigger.

01:06:25.711 --> 01:06:26.732
MATT: All righty.

01:06:26.732 --> 01:06:29.830
SAM: I don't even know what it does.

01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:34.618
LIAM: Fingers going out the windows of the church
like Alice in Wonderland.

01:06:34.618 --> 01:06:42.950
MATT: All right. Bigby's Hand. With a clenched
fist deals an additional 2d8 damage.

01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:43.988
SAM: Okay.

01:06:43.988 --> 01:06:46.669
MATT: So if you're going to punch it, it does an
additional 2d8 damage.

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:48.552
SAM: Yes, I think--

01:06:48.552 --> 01:06:50.480
MATT: What are you going to do?

01:06:50.480 --> 01:07:00.162
SAM: I'm going to bitch-slap it, but the forceful
hand. So I can just push it far away from us.

01:07:00.162 --> 01:07:01.771
Possibly to the front door.

01:07:01.771 --> 01:07:04.924
MATT: Okay, I see. So it does no damage but it
does force its movement.

01:07:04.924 --> 01:07:05.845
SAM: Yeah.

01:07:05.845 --> 01:07:13.781
MATT: Okay, and I'll say because you did it at a
higher level, it's an additional five feet of

01:07:13.781 --> 01:07:16.852
movement on that. So, as the hand shoves toward
the creature--

01:07:16.852 --> 01:07:18.540
SAM: It takes no damage for that?

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:23.852
MATT: The forceful hand it doesn't, no. There's
grasping hand and the clenched fist do damage.

01:07:23.852 --> 01:07:25.724
SAM: All right, so then I'll just hit it. I'll
just hit it hard.

01:07:25.724 --> 01:07:30.392
MATT: Okay. So, you bitch-slap it physically hard.
Clenched fist. Go ahead and make a spell attack.

01:07:30.392 --> 01:07:32.757
Go ahead and roll a d20, add your spell attack
modifier.

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:38.525
SAM: 14. Plus, what am I adding? Oh, nine. Plus
nine.

01:07:38.525 --> 01:07:43.832
MATT: 14 plus nine? That hits. Go ahead and roll
damage. That's 6d8 force damage because you cast

01:07:43.832 --> 01:07:45.124
it at 6th level.

01:07:45.124 --> 01:07:50.310
SAM: 6d8. I don't even know what those are. That's
a ten.

01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:51.417
LIAM: They look like diamonds.

01:07:51.417 --> 01:07:54.234
SAM: There they go. I got one. I'll just roll it
six times.

01:07:54.234 --> 01:07:56.887
TRAVIS: (singing) Diamonds are Scanlan's best
friend.

01:07:56.887 --> 01:07:59.226
LAURA: No, diamonds are Vex's best friend.

01:07:59.226 --> 01:08:03.666
SAM: 24?

01:08:03.666 --> 01:08:04.989
MATT: 24.

01:08:04.989 --> 01:08:06.530
SAM: Even at 6th-level, that's all it did.

01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:13.880
MATT: Yeah. As that happens, the fist clenches and
(wham) bitch-slaps the back of the wailing ghost

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:19.674
creature. As it does you hear it scream out in
pain (screech) as its spectral form is scattered

01:08:19.674 --> 01:08:21.593
across the air and dissipates.

01:08:21.593 --> 01:08:24.051
SAM: What?

01:08:24.051 --> 01:08:25.152
MARISHA: Thank god.

01:08:25.152 --> 01:08:26.090
SAM: What?

01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:27.047
TRAVIS: I think you smashed it.

01:08:27.047 --> 01:08:27.867
MARISHA: You killed it.

01:08:27.867 --> 01:08:28.774
LIAM: You crushed it.

01:08:28.774 --> 01:08:30.234
SAM: But I'm so little and wee!

01:08:30.234 --> 01:08:33.082
LIAM: Lift yourself up for a victory lap.

01:08:33.082 --> 01:08:38.780
SAM: Yes, I lift myself up with Bigby's Hand.
Yeah, that was a great idea.

01:08:38.831 --> 01:08:40.468
MATT: You toss yourself up a couple times.

01:08:40.468 --> 01:08:45.049
SAM: Whoa!

01:08:45.049 --> 01:08:46.423
TRAVIS: Meanwhile, Percy's unconscious.

01:08:46.423 --> 01:08:47.859
SAM: Oh shit! Percy!

01:08:47.859 --> 01:08:56.485
LIAM: No, I've got four healing potions. I pour,
it's not the best. It's a greater healing?

01:08:56.485 --> 01:09:00.458
MATT: So, it's 4d4 plus four.

01:09:00.515 --> 01:09:04.213
SAM: I will also sing for him a Song of Rest,
which is just another d6.

01:09:04.213 --> 01:09:05.840
MATT: If you guys are taking a short rest--

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.706
SAM: Yeah. Oh, are we clear of danger?

01:09:08.706 --> 01:09:11.695
LIAM: We don't know, but I poured the potion into
Percy's mouth.

01:09:11.695 --> 01:09:12.773
TALIESIN: 4d4 plus four?

01:09:12.773 --> 01:09:13.694
MATT: Yep, you got it.

01:09:13.694 --> 01:09:25.687
TALIESIN: Four, five, six, seven, nine, ten, 14.
Yep. I'm awake. Hurt, but--

01:09:25.687 --> 01:09:28.895
LIAM: I slap him twice, anyway.

01:09:28.895 --> 01:09:30.787
TALIESIN: Ugh! Ah!

01:09:30.787 --> 01:09:31.961
LIAM: What do we do?

01:09:31.961 --> 01:09:33.056
SAM: What are we doing here?

01:09:33.056 --> 01:09:35.462
LIAM: The priest's dead. Is there anyone else, or
should we head back?

01:09:35.462 --> 01:09:41.115
TALIESIN: We should head back. Apparently, any
help I thought we'd find here is obviously gone.

01:09:41.115 --> 01:09:43.522
SAM: Should we check this other room first, before
we go?

01:09:43.522 --> 01:09:44.867
TALIESIN: Did we not check the other room?

01:09:44.867 --> 01:09:45.716
SAM and LIAM: No.

01:09:45.716 --> 01:09:46.732
TALIESIN: Let's check the other room, and--

01:09:46.732 --> 01:09:47.677
SAM: Quickly, though, quickly.

01:09:47.677 --> 01:09:48.641
TALIESIN: We'll check the other room quickly.

01:09:48.641 --> 01:09:52.806
LIAM: While they check the room, I'm going to go
all over the altar and see if there's anything,

01:09:52.806 --> 01:09:55.932
any hidden door, any trapdoor, anything like
that.

01:09:55.932 --> 01:09:57.370
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a perception check.

01:09:57.370 --> 01:10:04.549
LIAM: Eh. That's a-- oh! No! Wait, I keep
forgetting that's a rogue skill. That's a 20.

01:10:04.549 --> 01:10:08.386
TALIESIN: I was really hoping you missed that
part.

01:10:08.386 --> 01:10:15.032
MATT: Looking over the altar, it appears to be
smooth, solid stone. Nothing catches your

01:10:15.032 --> 01:10:24.024
attention. You check the other room. This is a
small kitchen, essentially, for whoever was

01:10:24.024 --> 01:10:30.700
running here would make small meals or things to
delineate during worship and/or just cook for its

01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:32.836
own meals when the father was keeping--

01:10:32.836 --> 01:10:35.307
TALIESIN: Has it been used recently? Is it--

01:10:35.307 --> 01:10:39.907
MATT: It does not appear to have been used, you
can make an investigation check to gather an idea

01:10:39.907 --> 01:10:41.088
of how long it's been there.

01:10:41.088 --> 01:10:43.247
SAM I'm going to look around as well and food and
stuff.

01:10:43.247 --> 01:10:44.226
TALIESIN: 12.

01:10:44.226 --> 01:10:45.193
SAM: 22.

01:10:45.193 --> 01:10:51.589
MATT: Okay. You get the feeling that the last time
this was used was a little under a week ago.

01:10:51.589 --> 01:10:53.150
TALIESIN: All right.

01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:56.574
SAM: Any provisions that we can take? Water,
food?

01:10:56.574 --> 01:11:03.002
MATT: You find a couple of loaves of stale bread,
some dried meats, salted dry meats, like

01:11:03.002 --> 01:11:07.764
some jerky-ish type things. Things that are meant
to last a while. There is produce here, but the

01:11:07.885 --> 01:11:10.242
produce has long wilted and gone to rot.

01:11:10.242 --> 01:11:15.225
TALIESIN: I have theories on who's been using this
space. Is there anything that would clue me in to

01:11:15.225 --> 01:11:16.522
who's been using this space?

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:24.580
MATT: It's hard to really tell. You're not too
familiar with lifestyles of different individuals.

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:31.589
Whoever left the notes, and whoever was dabbling
with the vicinity does have a tendency towards

01:11:31.589 --> 01:11:41.837
sciences and alchemy in ways that seemingly can
blend and overlap with your specialty. That's the

01:11:41.837 --> 01:11:44.016
best you can ascertain, based on the information
given.

01:11:44.016 --> 01:11:47.944
TALIESIN: Now, here's the question. Do we leave
them a sign that we're here, or do we hope that

01:11:47.944 --> 01:11:49.646
they don't notice?

01:11:49.646 --> 01:11:56.086
SAM: Well, let's leave them a sign. We're supposed
to be sowing discontent, right? So, let's leave a

01:11:56.086 --> 01:12:00.892
sign that someone was here and fucked up their
shit. Do you want me to pee on the altar?

01:12:00.892 --> 01:12:01.903
TALIESIN: No.

01:12:01.903 --> 01:12:06.962
LIAM: I take my dagger, and I go to the altar--

01:12:06.962 --> 01:12:08.117
TALIESIN: Wait.

01:12:08.117 --> 01:12:09.972
SAM: No, don't leave your dagger; it's your only
one left.

01:12:09.972 --> 01:12:13.321
LIAM: I didn't say I'm leaving it. Yeah. You want
that?

01:12:13.321 --> 01:12:14.232
TALIESIN: I want that.

01:12:14.232 --> 01:12:17.951
LIAM: I start-- would you hand me that scrap of
paper, yeah?

01:12:17.951 --> 01:12:19.479
SAM: Whoa, this is our sign?

01:12:19.479 --> 01:12:25.936
LIAM: So I start carving this-- Is this Pelor?

01:12:25.936 --> 01:12:32.732
TALIESIN: This is not Pelor. It's part of the
crest of de Rolo.

01:12:32.732 --> 01:12:34.292
LAURA: Ooh!

01:12:34.292 --> 01:12:36.745
MARISHA: de Rolos are back!

01:12:36.745 --> 01:12:40.825
LIAM: Okay. So, I just start scraping it into the
stone with the Keen Dagger.

01:12:40.825 --> 01:12:46.052
MATT: Okay. And it gives a horrible screeching
sound as you carve into this well-polished stone

01:12:46.222 --> 01:12:51.656
surface that's used predominantly for worship, or
when it was. Given about five, ten minutes in you

01:12:51.656 --> 01:12:56.983
manage to scrape a design into it that is visually
distinct against the smooth surface, and does

01:12:56.983 --> 01:12:59.058
match the design best to your ability that
Percy--

01:12:59.058 --> 01:13:04.360
TALIESIN: I would also like to drag Father Reynal
out of his room and put him at the pedestal.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:05.721
MATT: Okay.

01:13:05.721 --> 01:13:14.925
LIAM: And then before we go, I'm going to the
wooden door, and I carve into the door: Pelor

01:13:14.925 --> 01:13:18.410
lives in Whitestone.

01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:20.827
SAM: That's a lot of words.

01:13:20.827 --> 01:13:22.328
MARISHA: Six hours later...

01:13:22.328 --> 01:13:24.691
LIAM: It's wood! It took me five minutes.

01:13:24.691 --> 01:13:33.954
MATT: Okay. You finish your carving, seemingly
without recurring incident.

01:13:33.954 --> 01:13:37.379
TALIESIN: Like to head back now, I believe.

01:13:37.379 --> 01:13:41.193
MATT: Yeah. You guys make your way out of the
temple back into the center of the graveyard. The

01:13:41.193 --> 01:13:47.855
sun is beginning to set. The reds and purples of
the night sky are starting to creep in, as it just

01:13:47.855 --> 01:13:52.703
begins to crest on the far western side of the
mountain range surrounding the valley.

01:13:52.703 --> 01:13:54.016
MARISHA: I have a question.

01:13:54.016 --> 01:13:54.818
MATT Yes.

01:13:54.818 --> 01:13:59.174
MARISHA: What's the weather been like since we've
been in Whitestone?

01:13:59.174 --> 01:14:00.949
MATT: It's been spotty, cloudy--

01:14:00.949 --> 01:14:04.434
MARISHA: The sun has come out during the daytime?

01:14:04.434 --> 01:14:10.231
MATT: Bits and pieces. There is heavy cloud cover
that seems to be pushing through. It brings colder

01:14:10.231 --> 01:14:13.888
weather. It looks like when you first got there,
there was some snowfall that happened before you

01:14:13.888 --> 01:14:20.725
arrived. You've had a few days of sun, but I'd say
about half the day is cloud cover.

01:14:20.725 --> 01:14:26.240
MARISHA: Does it seem to be fairly natural weather
for this time of year? Okay.

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:31.041
MATT: And this far north, too. All right. You
guys--

01:14:31.041 --> 01:14:34.343
LIAM: I also grab those wooden stakes off the
ground.

01:14:34.343 --> 01:14:39.636
MATT: Okay. Takes you a little time, because
they're amongst a bunch of other

01:14:39.636 --> 01:14:40.902
broken wooden scraps--

01:14:40.902 --> 01:14:42.200
LIAM: I grab a couple extra, as well.

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:47.004
MATT: Okay! You find some splintered wood. You
guys make your way back into the town. I'd like

01:14:47.004 --> 01:14:50.398
you all to make a stealth, or a deception check,
if you prefer.

01:14:50.398 --> 01:14:53.816
SAM: Deception, please. (sings a ditty) I'm just a
peasant boy.

01:14:53.816 --> 01:14:56.024
TALIESIN: 13.

01:14:56.024 --> 01:14:57.998
MATT: 13.

01:14:57.998 --> 01:14:59.291
TRAVIS: G'day sir.

01:14:59.291 --> 01:15:00.414
LIAM: 23.

01:15:00.414 --> 01:15:01.235
MATT: Okay.

01:15:01.235 --> 01:15:02.190
SAM: 32.

01:15:02.190 --> 01:15:13.568
MATT: All right. As you guys are making your way
back towards the tavern, there is a small group of

01:15:13.568 --> 01:15:21.321
Whitestone villagers walking and having a
conversation. Not heated, but there is a sense of

01:15:21.321 --> 01:15:29.557
desperate conversation amongst them. And, standing
with them you can see there's an older gentleman,

01:15:29.557 --> 01:15:37.158
mostly bald, long scraggly gray hair that falls
past his shoulders, a little bit hunched. He's

01:15:37.158 --> 01:15:43.599
wearing dark leathers and a cloak that's over one
shoulder and drags the ground behind him. And

01:15:43.599 --> 01:15:48.518
they're talking to him and he's growling to
himself and the best you can make out is there's

01:15:48.518 --> 01:15:57.160
an argument about farming shipments and the
inability to make dates and requirements. He

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:05.372
shouts back to the remainder, says, "Listen, it is
beyond my control. This is what has been decreed

01:16:05.542 --> 01:16:10.358
"by Sir Kerrion. That is how it'll be. If you
cannot provide, then taxes will be pulled. If you

01:16:10.358 --> 01:16:18.589
"cannot pay, then there are far worse things we can
take. Now, be on your way!" And steps away from

01:16:18.589 --> 01:16:28.479
the group, looks over and sees a little boy and this
in the shadows skulking individual. "You there!"

01:16:28.548 --> 01:16:30.389
TALIESIN: Yes?

01:16:30.389 --> 01:16:32.472
MATT: "You new around here?"

01:16:32.472 --> 01:16:34.034
TALIESIN: A bit, yes.

01:16:34.034 --> 01:16:38.079
MATT: "I don't recognize you." And two of the
guards step forward.

01:16:38.079 --> 01:16:41.308
TALIESIN: I suppose it's our good luck, then.

01:16:41.308 --> 01:16:43.833
MATT: "What's your name?"

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:47.095
TALIESIN: (sighs) Reggie.

01:16:47.095 --> 01:16:48.880
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:53.346
TALIESIN: Fuck my life. I know! 21!

01:16:53.346 --> 01:16:57.245
LIAM: My name's Reggie.

01:16:57.245 --> 01:17:03.234
MATT: "Then make yourself useful. Maybe you can
make up for some of these lost crops that these

01:17:03.234 --> 01:17:05.925
"bags of shite keep saying they can't do."

01:17:05.925 --> 01:17:08.203
TALIESIN: I'm actually supposed to be going back
for a--

01:17:08.203 --> 01:17:10.799
MATT: "I don't give a shit, move on, boy."

01:17:10.799 --> 01:17:12.424
TALIESIN: Yes, sir.

01:17:12.424 --> 01:17:18.760
MATT: He grumbles and keeps on walking. The guards
give you a look. One of them spits at your foot,

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:26.189
keeps walking on. Eventually, they drift aside.
You continue your path back to the tavern where

01:17:26.189 --> 01:17:30.733
the rest of you are waiting. The sun has now set.
Night has taken the sky and Keyleth is on the

01:17:30.733 --> 01:17:32.929
verge of completing her ritual.

01:17:32.929 --> 01:17:36.275
LAURA: I'm cleaning my nails as I'm watching her.

01:17:36.275 --> 01:17:43.644
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye from the second
floor. I want to see how much movement in the city

01:17:43.644 --> 01:17:50.039
there is and whether or not there's any guards by
the tree, whether or not the tree seems to be left

01:17:50.039 --> 01:17:51.454
to its own devices.

01:17:51.454 --> 01:17:59.885
MATT: Okay. As you're keeping watch, you notice
occasionally there will be one of the zombie

01:17:59.885 --> 01:18:05.857
giants that will lumber through the center of
town. There's a very specific pattern that they

01:18:05.857 --> 01:18:07.193
tend to follow.

01:18:07.193 --> 01:18:09.994
TALIESIN: Definitely trying to memorize that.

01:18:09.994 --> 01:18:14.510
MATT: And you do notice a couple of other guards
that you didn't notice during the day begin to

01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:21.876
show up. They're humanoid; they're armored. They
sneak around. They're humanoid, but their movement

01:18:21.876 --> 01:18:23.421
is unnatural.

01:18:23.421 --> 01:18:26.626
TALIESIN: Is there a lot of light in the town, or
not very much light?

01:18:26.626 --> 01:18:33.070
MATT: Not very much light at all. There's very
low-lit points at certain crossroads that've been

01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:36.378
left up for general visibility for those who have
to travel at night, but you gather most people

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:38.357
just do not travel at night here in Whitestone.

01:18:38.357 --> 01:18:41.590
LAURA: Make sure no lights are lit in our--

01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:42.818
TALIESIN: We've already blacked out--

01:18:42.818 --> 01:18:44.206
SAM: I blacked out the windows.

01:18:44.206 --> 01:18:45.104
LAURA: Okay.

01:18:45.104 --> 01:18:46.618
MATT: Keyleth--

01:18:46.618 --> 01:18:47.650
MARISHA: Yeah?

01:18:47.650 --> 01:18:51.509
MATT: You finally complete your ritual. Sweat
pouring down your brow,

01:18:51.509 --> 01:18:53.957
you have your hand on the roots--

01:18:53.957 --> 01:19:06.466
MARISHA: Can I do something? Something real quick
for my final, extra drama? So, as I complete the

01:19:06.466 --> 01:19:19.839
ritual, remembering that Pelor, and this is a sun
tree. I'm going to cast my 6th-level Sunbeam spell

01:19:19.839 --> 01:19:27.128
as I'm finishing the Plant Growth with the last
big essence--

01:19:27.128 --> 01:19:28.479
SAM: At night?

01:19:28.479 --> 01:19:37.025
MARISHA: I'm underground. So, I'm going to take my
Sunbeam, and wrap it up with my druid goodness.

01:19:37.025 --> 01:19:41.294
And shove it in the tree.

01:19:41.378 --> 01:19:44.693
TALIESIN: You're going to shove it where the sun
don't shine.

01:19:44.693 --> 01:19:50.393
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to kill it. I don't know
if it's going to work or not.

01:19:50.393 --> 01:19:55.252
MATT: Okay. Roll a d20 and add your wisdom
modifier.

01:19:55.252 --> 01:19:59.254
MARISHA: Do I get advantage on this? Because of
Heroes' Feast?

01:19:59.254 --> 01:20:05.073
MATT: I would say no, because this isn't a saving
throw and because what you're attempting to do is

01:20:05.073 --> 01:20:11.354
essentially convert a highly damaging spell into a
non-damaging circumstance at the end of an

01:20:11.354 --> 01:20:16.289
eight-hour endurance match with a ritual. This is
going to be a difficult attempt. So go ahead and

01:20:16.289 --> 01:20:18.803
roll a d20. Add your wisdom modifier.

01:20:18.803 --> 01:20:20.783
MARISHA: I hope I didn't just fuck up by doing
this.

01:20:20.783 --> 01:20:22.172
LAURA: You got it, Keyleth.

01:20:22.172 --> 01:20:24.649
TRAVIS: Yeah, you never get arrested or anything,
you're good.

01:20:24.649 --> 01:20:27.736
SAM: Use the green one. This is you doing
greenery.

01:20:27.736 --> 01:20:30.494
MARISHA: I'm so nervous.

01:20:30.494 --> 01:20:36.118
SAM: Natural 20. Easy. Or a six.

01:20:36.187 --> 01:20:37.099
LAURA: Oh, no.

01:20:37.099 --> 01:20:39.133
MARISHA: But my wisdom's not bad, so 12?

01:20:39.133 --> 01:20:49.774
MATT: You complete the ritual and release the
healing energy of your Plant Growth spell. As you

01:20:49.774 --> 01:20:54.236
release it you begin to concentrate on the sun ray
and you begin to see, throughout the pieces of

01:20:54.236 --> 01:20:59.739
earth around, seeds quickly begin to germinate
and small little bits of ivy, greenery begin to

01:20:59.739 --> 01:21:04.656
pierce out from parts of the earth in your
immediate vicinity, as this affects a large

01:21:04.656 --> 01:21:17.635
radius. There does not appear to be any sort of
immediate reaction by the tree. You begin to pull

01:21:17.635 --> 01:21:30.210
back and concentrate on the spell. You release the
Sunbeam forward. In the frustration of the lack of

01:21:30.210 --> 01:21:37.611
reaction from the tree and the desperation to make
sure some effect happens, you release the full

01:21:37.611 --> 01:21:42.953
force of the beam as opposed to the prequel aspect
and you burst into some of the roots, blasting

01:21:42.953 --> 01:21:46.669
some of them apart and beginning to set flame to
part of the under of the tree.

01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:50.045
MARISHA: Oh, cool. That's cool. Cool story.

01:21:50.045 --> 01:21:51.295
LIAM: Bucket of water.

01:21:51.295 --> 01:21:55.026
MARISHA: I'll put it out.

01:21:55.026 --> 01:21:56.519
MATT: You guys hear this (explosion).

01:21:56.519 --> 01:22:01.349
LAURA: That's right in front of-- I pull out my
cloaks in my bag and start trying to put out the

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:06.282
flames. Keyleth, what? Was that supposed to
happen? Is that good? Was this good? Should I

01:22:06.282 --> 01:22:09.883
stop? I keep putting out the flames.

01:22:09.883 --> 01:22:21.264
MATT: You put out the flames. And you notice where
the fire had burned aspects of the wood, there is

01:22:21.264 --> 01:22:28.150
the black char marks across the roots where the
flames touched, and the area surrounding the root

01:22:28.150 --> 01:22:35.282
is a little more of a vibrant brown color. Almost
like a little hint of life seemed to have seeped

01:22:35.282 --> 01:22:36.941
into the root.

01:22:36.941 --> 01:22:38.262
MARISHA: Oh my god.

01:22:38.262 --> 01:22:42.158
MATT: It expands for a moment and you can see a
little bit of life return to that localized

01:22:42.187 --> 01:22:43.562
section of the tree.

01:22:43.562 --> 01:22:53.916
MARISHA: Ooh! Like starting a fire. (blows air)
Go, go! Can I Druidcraft? Come on!

01:22:53.916 --> 01:22:59.994
MATT: As you do, there's still these bits of ivy
greenery, this long-embedded seeds through years

01:22:59.994 --> 01:23:04.633
and years and generations of earth layering in
here. These long-dormant seeds are starting to

01:23:04.633 --> 01:23:12.344
come to life and spring through the earth around
you. The expansion of the healthier portion of the

01:23:12.344 --> 01:23:18.829
root begins to spread, and then stop spreading.
And you begin to notice all the greenery

01:23:18.829 --> 01:23:26.366
begins to immediately wither and crumple and turn
to ash. And you watch as the vibrant aspect of the

01:23:26.448 --> 01:23:31.512
roots slowly drain from the bottom up. Like
something is pulling the

01:23:31.512 --> 01:23:33.355
life force out of the roots.

01:23:33.355 --> 01:23:36.338
LAURA: They're sucking the life force out of the
earth.

01:23:36.338 --> 01:23:44.059
MARISHA: I take some of that holy oil that Vax
gave me and I dip my finger in it and start

01:23:44.059 --> 01:23:48.030
rubbing it along the vines that are growing along
the edge of the roots.

01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:53.412
MATT: You take the holy oil and place it along the
roots, and it soaks into the dry and in some cases

01:23:53.412 --> 01:24:04.831
now charred aspects of the roots. You wait a
moment, and the oil seems to almost burn off and

01:24:04.831 --> 01:24:06.054
evaporate.

01:24:06.054 --> 01:24:07.875
SAM: So, the ground is cursed.

01:24:07.875 --> 01:24:09.860
MARISHA: The ground is cursed.

01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:13.250
SAM: Well, poo.

01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:15.253
TRAVIS: Should I try peeing on it?

01:24:15.253 --> 01:24:16.435
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:24:16.435 --> 01:24:17.915
MARISHA: Perception check?

01:24:17.915 --> 01:24:20.710
TALIESIN: That thing you hate doing?

01:24:20.710 --> 01:24:24.168
MARISHA: No, I'm good at perceiving things, I'm
just not good at reading people.

01:24:24.168 --> 01:24:25.528
SAM: You know what we need to do?

01:24:25.528 --> 01:24:28.236
MARISHA: That's not bad. 23?

01:24:28.236 --> 01:24:32.151
SAM: Hydroponics. No ground, just grow it above.

01:24:32.151 --> 01:24:41.144
MATT: The pattern of decay that followed your
initial attempt at reviving this vicinity, all had

01:24:41.144 --> 01:24:50.252
a very distinct downward motion of draining. There
was something about the ground, something beneath

01:24:50.252 --> 01:24:55.118
the tree and where you are that is seemingly
taking the life force of the surroundings.

01:24:55.118 --> 01:24:59.055
LAURA: Oh, my god, what if the vampire thing is
right underneath us?

01:24:59.055 --> 01:25:03.413
MARISHA: I was going to say, can I still see the
green being sucked down a bit?

01:25:03.413 --> 01:25:07.866
MATT: At this point, all the life force was very
quickly drained.

01:25:07.866 --> 01:25:18.809
LAURA: Can I use my Primeval Awareness and sense
any sort of vampiric presence within our very

01:25:18.809 --> 01:25:20.067
close vicinity?

01:25:20.067 --> 01:25:22.828
MATT: What's the radius on that?

01:25:22.828 --> 01:25:28.792
LAURA: It's a minute. It's up to six miles if I
spend six minutes.

01:25:28.792 --> 01:25:35.244
MATT: Okay. So you take your time, and you begin
to focus and it expands. As you do, focusing on

01:25:35.244 --> 01:25:53.008
vampiric presence, you feel a fair amount of
presence: above, below and further north. And

01:25:53.008 --> 01:26:01.410
smattered throughout the city. You get the
sensation at this point in time that there is much

01:26:01.475 --> 01:26:08.502
more beyond just Lord Briarwood that have come to
be a creature of the night in this city.

01:26:08.502 --> 01:26:15.488
LAURA: (whispering) That's good. Bad. Probably
bad.

01:26:15.488 --> 01:26:20.826
TRAVIS: Maybe they're not below the tree, maybe
it's just the soil.

01:26:20.826 --> 01:26:22.708
TALIESIN: The ground is tainted.

01:26:22.708 --> 01:26:24.791
MARISHA: I'm exhausted.

01:26:24.791 --> 01:26:26.203
SAM and TALIESIN: Let's sleep.

01:26:26.203 --> 01:26:31.568
LAURA: We're just going to sleep? Surrounded by
vampires, we're just going to sleep surrounded by

01:26:31.568 --> 01:26:33.340
lots and lots of vampires?

01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:36.367
TALIESIN: I'm going to tinker for a moment on my
glove with that thing I talked about.

01:26:36.367 --> 01:26:42.075
MATT: Okay. Make an intelligence check.

01:26:42.075 --> 01:26:43.961
TALIESIN: An intelligence check?

01:26:43.961 --> 01:26:46.474
MATT: Yeah, just a straight intelligence check.

01:26:46.474 --> 01:26:47.904
TALIESIN: 14.

01:26:47.904 --> 01:27:00.107
MATT: 14. Incorporating this organic organ?
Keeping it from rotting is already going to be a

01:27:00.107 --> 01:27:04.716
feat. In order to incorporate any of its natural
charge essence is going to require your workshop.

01:27:04.716 --> 01:27:08.047
Doing that on the go is too intricate.

01:27:08.047 --> 01:27:10.444
TALIESIN: I just wanted to think about it. It's
fine.

01:27:10.444 --> 01:27:14.257
MATT: I mean, it may be functional. It's
definitely possible to use what you extracted from

01:27:14.257 --> 01:27:21.184
the behir to be a way to charge your Diplomacy,
but that is something that you'll have to do in a

01:27:21.184 --> 01:27:25.351
controlled space when you have everything at your
disposal. It's a very delicate process to even

01:27:25.351 --> 01:27:26.484
attempt it.

01:27:26.484 --> 01:27:28.884
TALIESIN: I think we get it.

01:27:28.884 --> 01:27:30.344
LIAM: I'll take first watch.

01:27:30.344 --> 01:27:34.165
MATT: Okay. You all take an evening's rest.

01:27:34.165 --> 01:27:36.064
MARISHA: I'm sorry I couldn't fix the tree, you
guys.

01:27:36.064 --> 01:27:38.111
TALIESIN: We learned a lot.

01:27:38.111 --> 01:27:42.746
LAURA: You even did that awesome fire thing at the
end that was really, really cool.

01:27:42.746 --> 01:27:46.124
MARISHA: Thanks. I was afraid I was going to
permanently kill it for a second.

01:27:46.124 --> 01:27:49.651
TALIESIN: We know it's not &lt;i&gt;dead&lt;/i&gt; dead. That it's
just tainted.

01:27:49.651 --> 01:27:53.697
SAM: Guys, I just want to say that I killed a door
and a banshee, so--

01:27:53.697 --> 01:27:55.490
LAURA: Really?

01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:57.064
SAM: Yeah.

01:27:57.064 --> 01:27:58.369
LAURA: Nice, Scanlan.

01:27:58.369 --> 01:28:00.629
SAM: The door was harder to kill.

01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:04.014
TRAVIS: That's some door!

01:28:04.014 --> 01:28:07.928
TALIESIN: It's okay. I think I figured out what we
have to do first.

01:28:07.928 --> 01:28:09.816
MARISHA: What do we have to do first?

01:28:09.816 --> 01:28:14.581
TALIESIN: I think we have to kill Kerrion
Stonefell.

01:28:14.581 --> 01:28:15.787
SAM: Who's that?

01:28:15.787 --> 01:28:20.523
TALIESIN: It's the one that everyone-- he's the
one managing all of the goods and all of the

01:28:20.523 --> 01:28:21.594
farming.

01:28:21.594 --> 01:28:24.297
SAM: Is that who they were talking about today?
The group?

01:28:24.297 --> 01:28:26.828
LAURA: Where is he at?

01:28:26.845 --> 01:28:29.464
SAM: Oh, Sir Kerrion. I thought they said
something else.

01:28:29.464 --> 01:28:35.232
TALIESIN: Kerrion Stonefell. He's in one of the
three-- I would assume that he's been given one of

01:28:35.232 --> 01:28:37.085
the three mansions in town.

01:28:37.163 --> 01:28:41.575
SAM: You think if we find him, kill him, and leave
his body on some sort of public display, it would

01:28:41.575 --> 01:28:44.782
sow some seeds of rebellion?

01:28:44.782 --> 01:28:48.435
TALIESIN: I think it would be the beginning. He's
who everybody's afraid of.

01:28:48.435 --> 01:28:49.888
TRAVIS: We could hang him in the tree.

01:28:49.888 --> 01:28:51.303
TALIESIN: We could hang him in the tree.

01:28:51.303 --> 01:28:53.610
SAM: We could. Grog, could you do something nasty
to his body?

01:28:53.610 --> 01:28:54.962
TRAVIS: Just say the word.

01:28:54.962 --> 01:28:56.368
LAURA: Oh, this is messed up.

01:28:56.368 --> 01:28:58.617
SAM: All right.

01:28:58.617 --> 01:29:00.347
TRAVIS: Do we check the mansions for him?

01:29:00.347 --> 01:29:04.678
TALIESIN: I think we ask around to see if there's
a way to ask around to find out

01:29:04.678 --> 01:29:06.156
who's in what house.

01:29:06.156 --> 01:29:09.535
SAM: Ask around? Let's just go house to house and
kill everyone in all of them!

01:29:09.535 --> 01:29:13.147
TALIESIN: Let's-- Eventually, yes.

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:17.960
TRAVIS: Hello. I'd like to share the news of our
Lord and Savior: my axe in your face!

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:20.988
SAM: Yes. We could be Mormons.

01:29:20.988 --> 01:29:28.282
MATT: As you guys take your watches and go to
sleep in the cold interior, and it is a cold

01:29:28.282 --> 01:29:31.102
interior of the tavern. As the night comes
through, this is your first time really staying

01:29:31.102 --> 01:29:38.959
the night in the center of Whitestone. Even though
you slept in the forest, in the boughs of the

01:29:38.959 --> 01:29:44.489
trees itself, the temperature grows far colder
here, and even with the warm interior, the windows

01:29:44.489 --> 01:29:49.220
frost over and you find yourselves having to
huddle or build some sort of small fire to even

01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:54.036
keep a semblance of comfort to rest. You all
eventually go to sleep throughout your various

01:29:54.036 --> 01:29:59.251
times. I would like everyone to make a wisdom
saving throw. With advantage, because you're still

01:29:59.251 --> 01:30:00.739
affected by the Heroes' Feast.

01:30:00.739 --> 01:30:02.145
SAM: Until noon tomorrow, right?

01:30:02.145 --> 01:30:03.332
MARISHA: 2PM tomorrow.

01:30:03.332 --> 01:30:06.046
SAM: Yeah!

01:30:06.088 --> 01:30:07.710
TALIESIN: 12.

01:30:07.710 --> 01:30:10.208
SAM: 17.

01:30:10.208 --> 01:30:12.078
MARISHA: 25.

01:30:12.078 --> 01:30:12.965
LIAM: 20.

01:30:12.965 --> 01:30:13.848
LAURA: 23.

01:30:13.848 --> 01:30:15.170
TRAVIS: 14.

01:30:15.170 --> 01:30:24.306
MATT: Okay. All of you wake the next morning
rested as best as can be. Percy, your entire

01:30:26.225 --> 01:30:30.270
evening was wracked with nightmare after
nightmare, imagery you wish to not recall.

01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:38.027
Whispers and voices familiar, unfamiliar, seeing
yourself pulled from your physical self into the

01:30:38.027 --> 01:30:44.548
heart of this banshee, then wrest from death,
barely, cackling in the distance. I want you to go

01:30:44.548 --> 01:30:47.915
ahead and mark on your sheet one point of
corruption.

01:30:47.915 --> 01:30:49.255
LAURA: Oh.

01:30:49.255 --> 01:30:50.430
TRAVIS: What does that mean?

01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:51.763
MARISHA: Oh no!

01:30:51.763 --> 01:30:53.524
SAM: I don't even know where that is on the
sheet!

01:30:53.524 --> 01:30:55.019
LAURA: He could be evil. We could turn evil here!

01:30:55.019 --> 01:31:02.343
MATT: As you wake up, you find yourself wracked by
those nightmares, a sense of nervousness comes to

01:31:02.343 --> 01:31:07.882
you. And there's a tremor to your voice now that's
uncontrollable. At times of silence, you find

01:31:07.882 --> 01:31:13.626
yourself impulsively clearing your throat. And
with that we're going to take a

01:31:13.626 --> 01:31:14.963
five-minute break.

01:31:14.963 --> 01:31:16.351
MARISHA: What the fuck?!

01:31:16.351 --> 01:31:17.609
TALIESIN: Yay!

01:31:17.609 --> 01:31:21.023
MATT: All right guys, keep this to a stringent
five-minute break so we can get to as much as we

01:31:21.023 --> 01:31:24.631
can before the show's up tonight. So we'll see you
guys here in five minutes? All right?

01:31:24.631 --> 01:31:26.732
LIAM: See you in 17.

01:31:26.732 --> 01:40:49.702
[break]

01:40:49.779 --> 01:40:54.559
MATT: Welcome back everyone. So, a couple quick
things. One, we're roughly 30 to 25 subs away from

01:40:54.559 --> 01:40:59.337
our next milestone. The milestone, as we do with
every 100 subs, the winner in the chat room, as

01:40:59.337 --> 01:41:04.027
long as you're active in it, gets a package of one
of our signed cast photos, as well as a wonderful

01:41:04.027 --> 01:41:09.031
poster art piece from our artist, Kit Buss, signed
by the cast, and that will also be our 10k mark.

01:41:09.076 --> 01:41:10.852
TRAVIS: Damn!

01:41:10.852 --> 01:41:12.123
LIAM: Damn, damn!

01:41:12.123 --> 01:41:13.470
TRAVIS: Skittles, motherfucker!

01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:18.165
MATT: It's pretty fantastic. So, as soon as we hit
that we'll have our next giveaway and a big

01:41:18.165 --> 01:41:19.903
celebration as we hit 10k.

01:41:19.958 --> 01:41:21.434
MARISHA: Get yourself a double cheeseburger.

01:41:21.434 --> 01:41:24.404
LIAM: (singing) Look at the Sun Tree!

01:41:24.404 --> 01:41:28.231
MATT: Also, you guys just caught, as that break
ended, a quick episode of Omnibus. Omnibus is a

01:41:28.283 --> 01:41:32.957
new show that shows here every Tuesday. It's
helmed by Ian and Hector, some of our fantastic

01:41:32.957 --> 01:41:37.036
hosts here. It talks about all sorts of things.
Not just Batman things. All sorts of things in

01:41:37.036 --> 01:41:39.442
geek culture and-- what's that?

01:41:39.442 --> 01:41:41.179
TALIESIN: There's more than Batman?

01:41:41.179 --> 01:41:46.570
MATT: There's more than Batman! It's crazy! I pop
up there every now and then to answer some

01:41:46.570 --> 01:41:50.591
questions and talk about some cool things, as well
as a number of other cool personalities that pop

01:41:50.591 --> 01:41:57.924
in and out. Check it out if you're around on
Tuesday. It's a lot of fun. All righty. So let's

01:41:57.924 --> 01:42:05.752
kick back into this. So, a rough morning's rest
come to fruition. Percy seems a little worse for

01:42:05.752 --> 01:42:07.760
wear after the evening's sleep.

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:09.103
MARISHA: You feeling okay?

01:42:09.103 --> 01:42:10.605
TALIESIN: (grunts)

01:42:10.605 --> 01:42:12.169
MARISHA: It was cold. Did you catch a cold?

01:42:12.169 --> 01:42:13.119
TALIESIN: No, I'm fine.

01:42:13.119 --> 01:42:14.168
MARISHA: Is your throat ticklish?

01:42:14.168 --> 01:42:15.387
TALIESIN: A little ticklish, I'm fine.

01:42:15.387 --> 01:42:17.249
MARISHA: Do you want some Goodberries? It might
help a little bit--

01:42:17.249 --> 01:42:18.343
LAURA: Keyleth.

01:42:18.343 --> 01:42:19.336
MARISHA: What?

01:42:19.336 --> 01:42:21.546
TALIESIN: I'll take some Goodberries.

01:42:21.546 --> 01:42:24.949
MARISHA: All right. If you suck on them a little
bit they act like "logenzes."

01:42:24.949 --> 01:42:26.700
SAM: "Logenzes?"

01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:28.372
MARISHA: Well, shut up.

01:42:28.372 --> 01:42:30.828
LIAM, SAM, and MARISHA: Kenny Logenzes.

01:42:30.828 --> 01:42:33.851
MATT: It's a whole business opportunity that was
missed.

01:42:33.851 --> 01:42:36.902
LAURA: Oh wait. Seeming has ended at this point,
hasn't it?

01:42:36.902 --> 01:42:38.096
MATT: Seeming has ended, yes.

01:42:38.096 --> 01:42:39.157
LAURA: So, Trinket is a bear.

01:42:39.157 --> 01:42:40.185
MATT: Trinket is now a bear.

01:42:40.185 --> 01:42:41.117
LAURA: Okay, cool.

01:42:41.117 --> 01:42:42.728
MATT: And not a donkey.

01:42:42.728 --> 01:42:44.230
TRAVIS: And not a donkey.

01:42:44.230 --> 01:42:45.714
LIAM: But he's indoors with us, right?

01:42:45.714 --> 01:42:48.451
LAURA: Yeah. I've been laying on him all night.

01:42:48.451 --> 01:42:53.612
TRAVIS: Man, that was a good night's sleep. Who do
we get to kill today?

01:42:53.612 --> 01:42:56.943
SAM: Sir Kerrion.

01:42:56.943 --> 01:42:59.103
TRAVIS: How many mansions are there?

01:42:59.103 --> 01:43:00.325
TALIESIN: There's three.

01:43:00.325 --> 01:43:02.892
TRAVIS: Right. One, three.

01:43:02.892 --> 01:43:05.380
LIAM: Do you know which one he lives in?

01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:06.258
TALIESIN: I don't.

01:43:06.258 --> 01:43:07.202
LIAM: Shit.

01:43:07.202 --> 01:43:12.961
SAM: Only one way to find out. Burn every house
down except for those three mansions and see who

01:43:12.961 --> 01:43:13.981
runs out.

01:43:13.981 --> 01:43:15.383
TRAVIS: I like it. Seconded.

01:43:15.383 --> 01:43:21.694
TALIESIN: I also think perhaps we should find a
new place to sleep tonight. I think it might be

01:43:21.694 --> 01:43:25.734
best. To mix it up. Keep moving.

01:43:25.734 --> 01:43:28.871
TRAVIS: But I've been peeing in the corner.

01:43:28.871 --> 01:43:32.337
LAURA: That's why it smells like it does. Grog!

01:43:32.337 --> 01:43:36.164
TRAVIS: What? Look, it's like they did in the old
days, they had chamberpots. I mean, I have my

01:43:36.164 --> 01:43:44.762
corner. It's my recreation corner. Sorry. Yeah,
that's my brand.

01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:48.262
LIAM: That is ripe. We're leaving.

01:43:48.262 --> 01:43:53.968
SAM: You want to all be peasants again? Can we not
just disguise ourselves in tattered clothes?

01:43:53.968 --> 01:43:56.152
LAURA: I have a bear. Do you want to disguise the
bear?

01:43:56.152 --> 01:43:59.130
SAM: Oh, wait. We could just leave the bear
behind.

01:43:59.130 --> 01:44:00.168
LAURA: In the house.

01:44:00.168 --> 01:44:04.634
SAM: He could guard this safe house, and then we
could go find another safe house.

01:44:04.634 --> 01:44:06.128
TALIESIN: Scanlan, cast the spell.

01:44:06.128 --> 01:44:11.278
SAM: All right, fine. Seeming it is. We're all
peasants and he's a donkey. And I'm a little boy.

01:44:11.278 --> 01:44:15.534
MATT: You're a little boy. Jovial boy without a
yo-yo.

01:44:15.534 --> 01:44:20.374
TALIESIN: There's a shop that I used to frequent.
We can see if that's perhaps been abandoned.

01:44:20.374 --> 01:44:25.125
LAURA: All right. I want like a crazy eye in my
Seeming.

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:28.163
SAM: Of course you can! I'll give you two crazy
eyes.

01:44:28.163 --> 01:44:30.902
MATT: (laughs) You now have two crazy eyes.

01:44:30.902 --> 01:44:34.734
LIAM: That's an improvement. That's nice.

01:44:34.734 --> 01:44:37.051
MATT: The majesty of bardic illusion.

01:44:37.051 --> 01:44:40.141
TALIESIN: So we're going to go to Beyond the
Horizon.

01:44:40.141 --> 01:44:42.064
MATT: Going to Beyond the Horizon?

01:44:42.064 --> 01:44:42.904
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:44:42.904 --> 01:44:49.903
MATT: All righty. You guys step out into the day's
sun. Today is fairly overcast. Clouds have taken

01:44:49.903 --> 01:44:56.170
the sky, and there is a bit of a light mist that
is falling. Not quite rain, but not quite drizzle,

01:44:56.170 --> 01:45:03.662
but just a mist in the air. It's a cold day. The
ground and most of the walkways and roads are a

01:45:03.662 --> 01:45:09.141
little damp due to the moisture in the air. Not
muddy, just a little bit of a packed wetness to

01:45:09.141 --> 01:45:16.968
it. As you head over towards Beyond the Horizon,
and that lies more in the northwestern

01:45:16.968 --> 01:45:23.342
quadrant of the city. A little ways around the
street from one of the noble houses, so you keep a

01:45:23.418 --> 01:45:31.127
wide berth. You come to the row of shops that
bookended it before, and you go to the curiosity

01:45:31.177 --> 01:45:37.092
shop to find that the building itself is partially
collapsed and ruined. The door is torn off the

01:45:37.092 --> 01:45:41.722
hinges and left to the side. Part of the ceiling
is fallen in.

01:45:41.722 --> 01:45:45.080
SAM: Is there a basement?

01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:49.596
LAURA: Yeah, secret doors? Can I use a perception
check to see if there's any kind of secret

01:45:49.596 --> 01:45:53.247
entrances in the rubble at all? Something that
leads to a cellar?

01:45:53.247 --> 01:45:56.597
MATT: Do you wander into the building? You guys are
still on the outside--

01:45:56.597 --> 01:45:58.243
LIAM: How collapsed is it?

01:45:58.243 --> 01:46:02.548
MATT: The whole building is still standing. It
just looks like the front entrance is caved in and

01:46:02.548 --> 01:46:03.800
the doors were pulled off.

01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:07.523
LAURA: I'll just old lady walk into the building
and look around.

01:46:07.523 --> 01:46:08.961
MATT: Okay.

01:46:08.961 --> 01:46:11.748
LIAM: I'll go in with her.

01:46:11.748 --> 01:46:13.230
TALIESIN: Do old ladies lick the air?

01:46:13.230 --> 01:46:16.727
LAURA: Yeah, she does. This crazy-eyed old lady
does.

01:46:16.727 --> 01:46:20.118
LIAM: Yeah, the eyes, they never go in the same
direction; one's always to the left

01:46:20.118 --> 01:46:21.520
and one to the right.

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:31.358
MATT: Looking about the inside, most of the
furniture has been broken or taken. You can see a

01:46:31.358 --> 01:46:37.305
bunch of shelves set up as this was once a
curiosity shop. Empty. Anything of worth has long

01:46:37.305 --> 01:46:38.910
been taken.

01:46:38.910 --> 01:46:43.131
SAM: Oi, Grandma! Any yo-yos in there?

01:46:43.131 --> 01:46:45.050
LAURA: I'm looking, boy.

01:46:45.050 --> 01:46:54.999
MATT: A large scattering of broken glass, and a
peppering of stains. Dark, ruddy stains across the

01:46:54.999 --> 01:47:01.478
hardwood floors you can see spattered in places.
Occasional rat seems to crawl out in the distance

01:47:01.478 --> 01:47:06.432
a little (rat squeaking) sound. But there is no
other sign of life within the interior. Go ahead

01:47:06.432 --> 01:47:08.863
and make an investigation check.

01:47:08.863 --> 01:47:14.202
LAURA: Ooh, with no advantage, right?

01:47:14.202 --> 01:47:16.172
MARISHA: What time is it?

01:47:16.172 --> 01:47:17.439
SAM: Oh, until noon.

01:47:17.439 --> 01:47:19.146
MARISHA: Until 2PM, yo!

01:47:19.146 --> 01:47:20.364
MATT: Wisdom check, not saving throw.

01:47:20.364 --> 01:47:21.896
MARISHA: Oh, never mind.

01:47:21.896 --> 01:47:23.014
LIAM: 13.

01:47:23.014 --> 01:47:25.313
MATT: 13?

01:47:25.313 --> 01:47:28.198
LIAM: 13.

01:47:28.198 --> 01:47:29.809
LAURA: That would have been an eight.

01:47:29.809 --> 01:47:32.962
MATT: Eight. Okay. You take a while pushing
through some of the rubble, checking behind the

01:47:32.962 --> 01:47:42.091
main desk, if you will, as to where most purchases
would have taken place. The place is cleared out,

01:47:42.091 --> 01:47:46.777
and looks like it's covered in enough dust to have
been left here for the better part of six months

01:47:46.777 --> 01:47:47.901
to a year.

01:47:47.901 --> 01:47:51.042
LAURA: I can't see any kind of like door that
leads to a cellar?

01:47:51.042 --> 01:47:59.572
MATT: Glancing about, you find what looks to be a
small cellar door that opens up in the floor in

01:47:59.572 --> 01:48:04.015
one of the back rooms. You open it up, there's a
small ladder, not even a staircase, a ladder that

01:48:04.015 --> 01:48:09.816
leads down in there. It's a small room, about ten
foot by ten foot. That room is also entirely

01:48:09.816 --> 01:48:10.993
cleaned out.

01:48:10.993 --> 01:48:16.741
LAURA: All right. No yo-yos here, boy.

01:48:16.741 --> 01:48:18.771
SAM: Thanks, grandmama.

01:48:18.771 --> 01:48:23.399
TALIESIN: Can we use this as a base of operations
in the moment, then?

01:48:23.399 --> 01:48:26.191
LAURA: But it's half-collapsed, it would not be
very protected.

01:48:26.191 --> 01:48:27.484
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're fully exposed.

01:48:27.484 --> 01:48:30.785
SAM: Let's just take a walkabout and see if
there's anything else around the area.

01:48:30.785 --> 01:48:34.453
TRAVIS: Do you want to head in one of the
directions of the mansions?

01:48:34.453 --> 01:48:36.163
TALIESIN: Let's head to the closest mansion.

01:48:36.163 --> 01:48:41.499
MATT: Okay. So you skirt back towards the the
crossroad, the nearest crossroad that heads

01:48:41.548 --> 01:48:49.661
northward to the very, very far northwest section
of Whitestone. There you come to this noble

01:48:49.711 --> 01:48:57.935
house, which has a nice bronzed fence around the
outside of it. Probably about seven feet tall with

01:48:57.935 --> 01:49:03.601
these intricate spears affixed to the top, almost
in a fleur-de-lis type pattern, but looks sharp

01:49:03.601 --> 01:49:08.680
enough to keep anyone from trying to leap over.
The front gate is currently chained off with a

01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:13.338
lock on it. There is a lawn, but the lawn itself
appears to be frost-crusted from the evening's

01:49:13.338 --> 01:49:19.770
moisture and cold temperature. What grass is there
is very gray and dull and currently crisp with a

01:49:19.770 --> 01:49:25.831
white frost dew. Is a slight hill, and you do see
the building itself. It's a very nice building.

01:49:25.831 --> 01:49:35.047
It's a deep brown. A lot of it appears to be like
natural stained wood from the local forest

01:49:35.108 --> 01:49:42.727
surrounding Whitestone, with highlights of deep
green and black. There does not appear to be any

01:49:42.807 --> 01:49:47.125
immediate sign of life from the inside, but there
does appear to be a light coming from the inside,

01:49:47.125 --> 01:49:52.643
so even at this point in the day, it can be dark
on the interior. You can see a little bit of light

01:49:52.643 --> 01:49:54.284
coming from one of the doors.

01:49:54.284 --> 01:49:59.092
MARISHA: Is there a mailbox with a name?

01:49:59.092 --> 01:50:00.814
(laughter)

01:50:00.814 --> 01:50:02.840
SAM: Are there guards out front or anything, or is
it just a gate?

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:04.243
MATT: It's just a gate, currently.

01:50:04.243 --> 01:50:05.763
SAM: Do you want me to go in?

01:50:05.763 --> 01:50:13.669
LAURA: What if we went to the fields and we asked
other peasants how we report to what's-his-fuck.

01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:15.405
Keron. Keron?

01:50:15.405 --> 01:50:16.390
TALIESIN: Kerrion.

01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:17.373
LAURA: Kerrion?

01:50:17.373 --> 01:50:18.665
TRAVIS: Oh. That's actually a good one.

01:50:18.665 --> 01:50:24.861
TALIESIN: I will say, chances that anybody in any
of these buildings is somebody we're going to want

01:50:24.861 --> 01:50:26.763
to take care of is very high.

01:50:26.763 --> 01:50:30.354
LAURA: So, just bust on in and kill them right
now.

01:50:30.354 --> 01:50:31.975
SAM: Just, whoever's in there?

01:50:31.975 --> 01:50:35.007
MARISHA: Is that actually what you're saying?

01:50:35.007 --> 01:50:39.383
LIAM: And you went from focusing on Kerrion, to
kicking in doors?

01:50:39.383 --> 01:50:41.493
TRAVIS: Are you feeling all right?

01:50:41.493 --> 01:50:43.233
LAURA: Yeah, you look a little pale, Percy.

01:50:43.233 --> 01:50:44.586
TALIESIN: I am a little pale.

01:50:44.586 --> 01:50:46.470
MARISHA: It's kind of like the game show problem.

01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:47.756
SAM: Well, you know.

01:50:47.756 --> 01:50:52.247
LAURA: Are you sick? Does Keyleth need to cast, I
don't know, Restoration on you or something?

01:50:52.247 --> 01:50:54.089
TALIESIN: I just had a bad night's sleep, that's
all.

01:50:54.089 --> 01:50:55.559
TRAVIS: Scanlan, go knock on that door.

01:50:55.559 --> 01:50:56.813
MARISHA: Do you have a fever?

01:50:56.813 --> 01:50:59.159
SAM: I'm just a little peasant boy.

01:50:59.159 --> 01:51:00.405
MARISHA: Is he running a fever?

01:51:00.405 --> 01:51:02.201
MATT: He is not actually, he's quite cold and
clammy.

01:51:02.201 --> 01:51:03.785
MARISHA: Ew.

01:51:03.785 --> 01:51:13.685
TALIESIN: My nice jacket. We can ask around. See
if we can manage to ask somebody without

01:51:13.685 --> 01:51:14.993
arousing--

01:51:14.993 --> 01:51:16.606
SAM: Is anyone else on the street?

01:51:16.606 --> 01:51:22.558
MATT: Right now, in this particular area, there is
nobody on the street. You passed a few folks. A

01:51:22.558 --> 01:51:24.892
lot of them seem to be traveling southward.

01:51:24.892 --> 01:51:29.053
TALIESIN: How far are we from the temple? The
Alcove?

01:51:29.053 --> 01:51:37.927
MATT: The Alcove is a little further east, it's probably
about a 15-minute walk. The other temple,

01:51:37.976 --> 01:51:45.107
that one is about a ten-minute walk south of here.
It's closer to the southwestern side of the city.

01:51:45.153 --> 01:51:49.891
TALIESIN: We could take a walk to the Lady's
Chamber and see if we run into anybody there or on

01:51:49.891 --> 01:51:52.826
the way, and it's only ten minutes out of the
way.

01:51:52.826 --> 01:51:54.247
TRAVIS: The Lady's Chamber?

01:51:54.247 --> 01:51:56.870
TALIESIN: Not as exciting as it sounds.

01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:58.406
LIAM: You know someone there?

01:51:58.406 --> 01:52:01.123
TALIESIN: (sighs) It's not looking like it.

01:52:01.123 --> 01:52:05.964
SAM: I bet it's empty. I mean, it's a temple. The
other one was.

01:52:05.964 --> 01:52:09.472
TRAVIS: All right, but I thought we were killing
somebody in this house.

01:52:09.472 --> 01:52:10.711
SAM: I thought so, too.

01:52:10.711 --> 01:52:11.812
TALIESIN: We'll get to it.

01:52:11.812 --> 01:52:14.829
SAM: I can just pop in there and see who's in
there and pop out.

01:52:14.829 --> 01:52:17.760
LAURA: Be killed? Never pop back out again.

01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:19.043
TALIESIN: He doesn't know what he looks like,
anyway.

01:52:19.043 --> 01:52:21.731
SAM: I'm just a peasant boy. You wouldn't kill a
harmless peasant boy.

01:52:21.731 --> 01:52:25.694
TALIESIN: I think they would, actually. They
already have.

01:52:25.694 --> 01:52:27.036
LAURA: We saw the tree.

01:52:27.036 --> 01:52:31.016
TALIESIN: Genuine proof that they are perfectly
fine killing a small peasant boy.

01:52:31.016 --> 01:52:36.777
LIAM: What is there in the way of guards out in the
open now, and those giants strolling about?

01:52:36.851 --> 01:52:42.475
MATT: The skulking humanoids you saw last night
that were wandering the streets? None of them

01:52:42.616 --> 01:52:52.634
visible. You do take in that far down the road to
the east of you there is a large shape looming

01:52:52.634 --> 01:52:55.159
around the corner in a shadow stretching across
the road.

01:52:55.159 --> 01:52:57.595
And you hear the distant (muffled stomping noise).

01:52:57.595 --> 01:52:59.385
LIAM: Are we within eyeshot of that thing right
now?

01:52:59.385 --> 01:53:02.888
MATT: Not yet. It looks like it's coming around a
corner at the bend of the road

01:53:02.888 --> 01:53:04.388
a ways to the east.

01:53:04.388 --> 01:53:08.750
LIAM: Is there anyone our size, any humanoid
guards around?

01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:09.731
TRAVIS: No.

01:53:09.731 --> 01:53:10.502
LIAM: Nothing?

01:53:10.502 --> 01:53:11.760
MATT: Currently? No.

01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:14.711
LIAM: I'm guessing the best time to sneak into any
of these places is during the day.

01:53:14.711 --> 01:53:17.845
MARISHA: Do we want to sneak in, though? You're
the only one who knows what they look like.

01:53:17.845 --> 01:53:19.264
MATT: It's coming around the bend.

01:53:19.264 --> 01:53:21.852
MARISHA: Okay, wait. Are the gates locked?

01:53:21.852 --> 01:53:23.985
SAM: Let's get out of here. Take a walk, we're
going to take a walk.

01:53:23.985 --> 01:53:28.017
TALIESIN: We're going to take a little walk and
let it pass by. Let's go to the Lady's Chamber.

01:53:28.017 --> 01:53:29.335
LIAM: Lady's Chambers, anyone?

01:53:29.335 --> 01:53:31.006
SAM: Towards the Lady's Chamber. We're not going
in.

01:53:31.006 --> 01:53:34.328
LIAM: It's full of prostitutes, Grog. Full.

01:53:34.328 --> 01:53:37.685
TALIESIN: You'll see. It's not really that
complicated.

01:53:37.685 --> 01:53:39.983
LIAM: What did you roll?

01:53:39.983 --> 01:53:44.507
MATT: All right. You guys dart southward across
the road, ducking into the alleys of the southern

01:53:44.507 --> 01:53:49.361
portion of the road, getting out of the visual
range of the zombie giant that is making its way

01:53:49.361 --> 01:53:56.362
down the road, across your path. Heading
southward, you dart through the back alleys and

01:53:56.362 --> 01:54:02.528
keeping free of the main central visual areas of
the city, you eventually make your way to the

01:54:02.528 --> 01:54:06.134
corner that houses the Lady's Chamber. And as you
guys see it--

01:54:06.134 --> 01:54:08.356
SAM: Have we passed any people?

01:54:08.356 --> 01:54:14.185
MATT: If you're keeping an eye out for that, yes.
In some of the alleyway, you do pass a couple that

01:54:14.185 --> 01:54:20.431
are holding some, what looks like either scavenged
groceries or some sort of food they have keeping

01:54:20.431 --> 01:54:21.475
close to themselves.

01:54:21.475 --> 01:54:22.728
SAM: Can I go talk to them?

01:54:22.728 --> 01:54:23.694
MATT: You can, indeed.

01:54:23.694 --> 01:54:24.859
LAURA: I'm going to come with you.

01:54:24.859 --> 01:54:30.430
MATT: All right. As they're both walking by,
keeping the hush, they see you guys step in the

01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:34.984
same alley. They stop for a second, looking you
over, give a nod.

01:54:34.984 --> 01:54:44.179
SAM: Oi, excuse me? My papa sent me to send a
present, a gift of sorts, to a Sir Keri? Kurion?

01:54:44.179 --> 01:54:45.106
LAURA: Kerrion?

01:54:45.106 --> 01:54:46.205
SAM: Kerrion?

01:54:46.205 --> 01:54:47.482
LAURA: Kerrion?

01:54:47.482 --> 01:54:49.739
SAM: We're just looking to see where we can
deliver the gift.

01:54:49.739 --> 01:54:51.197
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:54:51.197 --> 01:54:56.016
LIAM: Scanlan's forte. Come on.

01:54:56.016 --> 01:54:57.045
SAM: 29.

01:54:57.045 --> 01:54:59.312
(laughter)

01:54:59.312 --> 01:55:07.056
MATT: You both stop and the man gives her a look
like he's trying to usher her along, pulling her

01:55:07.056 --> 01:55:14.431
arm and she goes, "No, honey, it's just a child."
Walks up and leans forward and says, "If you're

01:55:14.431 --> 01:55:22.054
"looking for Sir Kerrion, you'll find him in the
extravagant abode to the southeast of the city."

01:55:22.054 --> 01:55:24.354
SAM: The one right over there?

01:55:24.354 --> 01:55:34.356
MATT: "No." And gives you a side look for a second
and says, "You don't want to go find the Countess

01:55:34.356 --> 01:55:40.116
"there. If you're looking for Sir Kerrion, you go
to the southeast. Look for the brick building.

01:55:40.116 --> 01:55:45.357
"That's where he stays. Near the farming area south
of us. You're not from here are you?"

01:55:45.357 --> 01:55:47.568
LAURA: We're new to town.

01:55:47.568 --> 01:55:49.249
SAM: She's blind.

01:55:49.249 --> 01:55:53.578
MATT: "Well, just do what he says. Don't question.
All right?"

01:55:53.578 --> 01:56:01.507
SAM: Okay. I just need to bring him this sack of
presents, or my papa will whip me pretty bad.

01:56:01.507 --> 01:56:02.910
TALIESIN: TMI.

01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:04.742
MATT: "Then perhaps you could do that quickly."

01:56:04.742 --> 01:56:08.075
SAM: You're so pretty and clean.

01:56:08.075 --> 01:56:15.402
MATT: She blushes for a second, goes like, "You
stay safe." And brushes the hair out of your eyes

01:56:15.402 --> 01:56:20.224
for a second and pinches your cheek a little bit,
and there's a look of sadness in her eyes, almost

01:56:20.224 --> 01:56:23.768
like, what horrible fate befalls this child, if
he's not careful.

01:56:23.768 --> 01:56:28.245
LAURA: I smack him on the back of the head and
say: Let's go boy! Keep up!

01:56:28.245 --> 01:56:32.165
SAM: I'm her seeing-eye boy.

01:56:32.165 --> 01:56:34.423
(laughter)

01:56:34.423 --> 01:56:40.360
MATT: She rushes back to the side of the man with
her and, "See, it's fine. Good luck!" And they

01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:42.733
both dart off down the alley again.

01:56:42.733 --> 01:56:46.539
LIAM: Sam Riegel, ladies and gentleman, he played
Gavroche in Les Mis. Gavroche, right here,

01:56:46.539 --> 01:56:47.616
Gavroche.

01:56:47.616 --> 01:56:52.000
MATT: On Broadway. Literally.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.958
TALIESIN: He is Oliver Twist.

01:56:53.958 --> 01:56:56.674
SAM: (singing) Consider yourself! (speaking) Oh,
that's a different show.

01:56:56.674 --> 01:56:58.591
TALIESIN: I was ready! I was ready.

01:56:58.591 --> 01:57:06.479
MATT: All right, so. You make your way southward
to probably what's the second largest road

01:57:06.479 --> 01:57:13.179
intersection in this city. Away from the Sun Tree
square. You can now see the temple to Erathis

01:57:13.179 --> 01:57:18.786
here. And it is a large stone half dome
amphitheater set up where it's built outward to

01:57:18.786 --> 01:57:23.593
face the actual crossroads. And there is a
courtyard built around it, a small stone wall

01:57:23.666 --> 01:57:28.073
about three feet tall, that encapsulates this
area. There is a couple of trees, but there isn't

01:57:28.073 --> 01:57:33.038
a lot of grass, most of it's just stonework--
Erathis being the goddess of civilization. You

01:57:33.038 --> 01:57:39.539
know, it has an interesting duality and disrespect
to Melora and all unbridled nature. Things that

01:57:39.539 --> 01:57:45.798
are controlled and civilized are definitely her
realm of expertise. But as you approach, like most

01:57:45.798 --> 01:57:52.121
of the grass here, it's pretty desolate and dead.
Winter is definitely making its way to this part

01:57:52.121 --> 01:58:00.855
of the city. You do notice that surrounding it,
there is dried ivy, and just a general feeling of

01:58:00.855 --> 01:58:05.093
solemn desperation and sadness. There are a few
people scattered throughout sitting on benches,

01:58:05.093 --> 01:58:09.561
sitting in quiet contemplation. Some of them are
clutching small holy symbols and doing a prayer to

01:58:09.561 --> 01:58:15.603
themselves while rocking in the bench. You do see
within the dome, there is a group of about four

01:58:15.603 --> 01:58:20.517
people that are all sitting, looking up to a man,
an older man with a thick, white mustache and

01:58:20.517 --> 01:58:27.657
receding white hair. His gray robes he's wearing
look weathered. You recognize him. While you

01:58:27.657 --> 01:58:31.255
haven't had too much interaction, not being much
of a pious man, in any form of religion from your

01:58:31.255 --> 01:58:35.513
history, but you do know, Keeper Yennen is the
head priest of Erathis here and is currently

01:58:35.513 --> 01:58:41.002
giving the tail-end of a small sermon to those
here. Hearing him, he speaks words of comfort

01:58:41.002 --> 01:58:47.755
talking of, through these dark days, we must bind
together as a community. We have to ensure that

01:58:47.755 --> 01:58:56.498
our livelihood and our existence is kept, and we
look out for our fellow man. There is solace in

01:58:56.498 --> 01:59:03.878
the friendships and bonds we keep here. And best
not to upset those that wish to keep us down.

01:59:03.878 --> 01:59:10.542
Erathis looks over us. There will be a time in
which our salvation will come. And he goes into

01:59:10.542 --> 01:59:14.067
this very rallying speech and trying to lift the
spirits of those around.

01:59:14.067 --> 01:59:15.536
MARISHA: You said there was 40?

01:59:15.536 --> 01:59:16.457
MATT: Four.

01:59:16.457 --> 01:59:19.335
MARISHA: Four. Right.

01:59:19.335 --> 01:59:21.245
SAM: But they're allowed to assemble?

01:59:21.245 --> 01:59:26.620
MATT: Yeah. There's four around him in the
amphitheater. There are probably another ten or so

01:59:26.620 --> 01:59:30.902
scattered about the various ground surrounding it,
just doing their own private prayer.

01:59:30.902 --> 01:59:33.365
TALIESIN: Do I have an opinion on Yennen?

01:59:33.365 --> 01:59:42.134
MATT: Yennen? From your previous experience and
what you've heard is a very-- can be a bit

01:59:42.134 --> 01:59:54.751
arrogant in his worship, but not in a way that is
considered dangerous or impactful to when the de

01:59:54.751 --> 02:00:03.300
Rolo families were in rule. He does good for the
people. Kind of a tool at times. But he practices

02:00:03.300 --> 02:00:06.345
well and he keeps the people's spirits up for those
who worship.

02:00:06.345 --> 02:00:08.925
TALIESIN: We found him a bit obnoxious to our
means and ends on occasion?

02:00:08.982 --> 02:00:13.347
MATT: On occasion, but mostly just his
personality. Nothing he's done personally. He's

02:00:13.347 --> 02:00:16.239
not a bad person, by any means. He's just, you
know.

02:00:16.239 --> 02:00:17.952
TALIESIN: He's also not a lapdog.

02:00:17.952 --> 02:00:22.842
MATT: Yeah. Strong-willed in his ideas.

02:00:22.842 --> 02:00:29.660
LAURA: Can we insight check him to see if it seems
like he's changed at all, or if he's still that

02:00:29.660 --> 02:00:31.201
same douchebag or if he's--

02:00:31.201 --> 02:00:33.907
MATT: You would have no basis of comparison. You
would be the only one that has.

02:00:33.963 --> 02:00:40.651
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk up to the little
meeting. Is it wrapping up right now?

02:00:40.651 --> 02:00:46.977
MATT: It seems like it's winding down. He finishes
the discussion about the bonds of community,

02:00:46.977 --> 02:00:55.074
speaks about this city sprang up from nothing, but
has a greater destiny to itself. If not here at

02:00:55.074 --> 02:00:58.719
Whitestone, one day we will all go past these
boundaries, these borders, and create our own

02:00:58.719 --> 02:01:07.908
cities. There is hope for this. And then begins to
go into a couple of familiar prayers tailored

02:01:07.908 --> 02:01:15.313
specifically to the Erathis way of thinking, and
then finishes and everyone looks up, bows their

02:01:15.313 --> 02:01:20.304
heads for a second and begin to stand up and walk
away from the amphitheater as he turns around and

02:01:20.304 --> 02:01:23.669
begins to clear off one of the back benches for
him to sit on.

02:01:23.669 --> 02:01:27.774
TALIESIN: I'm going to just walk up and start a
conversation.

02:01:27.774 --> 02:01:32.898
MATT: Okay. You walk up to him, he sits down. "Can
I help you?"

02:01:32.898 --> 02:01:41.164
TALIESIN: Do you think there's any hope for
Whitestone? Do you think there'll be a day the

02:01:41.164 --> 02:01:46.689
people can find happiness again?

02:01:46.748 --> 02:01:53.758
MATT: "I can say this. If history has taught me
anything, our people are a resilient bunch. There

02:01:53.758 --> 02:02:00.236
"has been much death, opposition, to all the free
peoples of these lands. And yet, they persevered

02:02:00.236 --> 02:02:10.533
"and surmounted these odds. I think, though, to
some degree a prison this town may have become,

02:02:10.533 --> 02:02:19.213
"perhaps we ourselves cannot see the distant ends.
It's easy to misinterpret the means of those that

02:02:19.213 --> 02:02:26.394
"would oppress us. But we can't go too long before
the world at large can see the atrocities

02:02:26.394 --> 02:02:30.365
"committed, the terrible entities that walk these
streets."

02:02:30.365 --> 02:02:35.705
TALIESIN: Do you think there will come a day that
these people can seize freedom for themselves

02:02:35.705 --> 02:02:38.480
against their oppressors?

02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:46.854
MATT: "I look forward to a day in which there can
be a beacon of outside hope. From the inside, I

02:02:46.854 --> 02:02:59.148
"fear many wills have been torn asunder. I'm sorry.
Forgive my manners. Welcome to the Lady's Chamber.

02:02:59.148 --> 02:03:05.355
"You are unfamiliar to me." And he looks out at you
guys standing at the peripheral of the

02:03:05.355 --> 02:03:10.115
amphitheater. "Travelers?"

02:03:10.115 --> 02:03:11.279
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:03:11.279 --> 02:03:19.804
MATT: "I fear the cold winter is looming. An ill
omen takes this city, friends. You may stay to

02:03:19.804 --> 02:03:25.824
"give worship, if you will, then I recommend you
continue on your way. There is little here but

02:03:25.824 --> 02:03:27.539
"dying tradition."

02:03:27.539 --> 02:03:30.197
TALIESIN: I have a prayer to give.

02:03:30.197 --> 02:03:33.246
MATT: "Interesting."

02:03:33.246 --> 02:03:42.016
TALIESIN: I pray for a day to come when outside
forces can rally the people of Whitestone again.

02:03:42.016 --> 02:03:48.088
That strangers may come and bring with them
salvation, and that the people will seize it.

02:03:48.088 --> 02:03:56.317
MATT: "You speak in strange confidence for a
traveler."

02:03:56.317 --> 02:04:04.749
TALIESIN: Look for signs, Keeper Yennen. Look for
signs. I'm going to hand him a piece of

02:04:04.749 --> 02:04:06.053
parchment.

02:04:06.053 --> 02:04:08.627
MATT: "Signs of what, I might ask?"

02:04:08.627 --> 02:04:11.638
TALIESIN: Salvation. Good day to you, sir.

02:04:11.638 --> 02:04:14.256
LIAM: Act cool. Everybody act cool.

02:04:14.256 --> 02:04:15.910
TALIESIN: We walk south.

02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:18.091
TRAVIS: We walk south. We leave.

02:04:18.091 --> 02:04:19.959
TALIESIN: And you know what I've left him.

02:04:19.959 --> 02:04:29.425
MATT: Yeah. As you're walking away, you hear his
voice call out after. "Wait! What does this mean?"

02:04:29.425 --> 02:04:36.457
He pulls the parchment forward, revealing the
symbol of the top of the de Rolo family crest.

02:04:36.457 --> 02:04:50.580
TALIESIN: That... (sighs) What appears dead may
not necessarily be death. And that with the shadow

02:04:50.642 --> 02:04:58.621
of death over the city perhaps there is life deep
underground. Perhaps things that appeared ended

02:04:58.621 --> 02:05:05.652
and gone are perhaps continuing to this day. And
may rise again.

02:05:05.652 --> 02:05:13.639
MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion check. Give
you advantage on this.

02:05:13.639 --> 02:05:16.550
TALIESIN: 16.

02:05:16.550 --> 02:05:23.738
MATT: Nods his head slowly, looks back at the
sheet. Looks back at you with a discerning look.

02:05:23.738 --> 02:05:26.861
TALIESIN: He's definitely not going to--

02:05:26.861 --> 02:05:33.961
MATT: Oh, not at all. You look like a dirty
peasant right now. Takes it and hastily closes it

02:05:33.961 --> 02:05:41.018
and folds it and puts it in the pouch. Steps back
over and gathers some of his loose tea leaves-- he

02:05:41.018 --> 02:05:47.527
was making himself some tea-- and looks about
shiftily, calls over one of the other worshipers

02:05:47.527 --> 02:05:50.279
and begins talking with them as you guys walk
away.

02:05:50.279 --> 02:05:51.225
TALIESIN: Let's head south.

02:05:51.225 --> 02:05:52.083
TRAVIS: South it is.

02:05:52.083 --> 02:05:53.079
SAM: To the--

02:05:53.079 --> 02:05:54.031
LAURA: To the house?

02:05:54.031 --> 02:05:54.866
SAM: To the house.

02:05:54.866 --> 02:05:56.961
TALIESIN: Kerrion Stonefell's stately manor.

02:05:56.961 --> 02:05:59.146
MARISHA: So wait, which mansion were we at?

02:05:59.146 --> 02:06:00.444
SAM and LAURA: The Countess.

02:06:00.444 --> 02:06:02.255
TALIESIN: Countess Anna Ripley.

02:06:02.255 --> 02:06:04.693
MARISHA: Which mansion is that out of the three?

02:06:04.693 --> 02:06:05.773
TALIESIN: That's the northeastern one.

02:06:05.773 --> 02:06:07.022
MARISHA: That's the northeastern one?

02:06:07.022 --> 02:06:10.256
LAURA: And she was which? Who was the Countess
again?

02:06:10.256 --> 02:06:15.335
TALIESIN: I'm assuming if it is who I suspect it
is, it's Countess Anna Ripley.

02:06:15.335 --> 02:06:17.246
SAM: And who is she to you?

02:06:17.246 --> 02:06:19.412
TALIESIN: She is a terrible person.

02:06:19.412 --> 02:06:22.340
SAM: Wait, she's the one who killed a bunch of
your people, right?

02:06:22.340 --> 02:06:23.697
MARISHA: She's the doctor, right?

02:06:23.697 --> 02:06:24.732
TALIESIN: She's the doctor.

02:06:24.732 --> 02:06:25.772
LAURA: Oh, she is the one!

02:06:25.772 --> 02:06:28.242
TRAVIS: Do we get to kill her?

02:06:28.242 --> 02:06:36.577
TALIESIN: I hope so. But let's-- one at a time. If
we're lucky, maybe one a day.

02:06:36.577 --> 02:06:39.461
MARISHA: Well, okay.

02:06:39.461 --> 02:06:41.224
TRAVIS: Like a vitamin?

02:06:41.224 --> 02:06:46.700
SAM: Like a Flintstone's vitamin. Except it's
assassination.

02:06:46.700 --> 02:06:49.334
TALIESIN: (coughs)

02:06:49.334 --> 02:06:54.501
SAM: Do you need some healing? Are you okay?

02:06:54.501 --> 02:06:55.978
TALIESIN: I'm fine. I'm fine.

02:06:55.978 --> 02:06:57.379
SAM: Scanlan can make you feel good.

02:06:57.379 --> 02:06:58.603
TALIESIN: I'm fine.

02:06:58.603 --> 02:07:00.275
TRAVIS: (laughs) He can make you feel real good.

02:07:00.275 --> 02:07:07.132
LAURA: Can I go up and ask Keyleth, outside of his
earshot, to maybe cast some sort of restoration on

02:07:07.132 --> 02:07:11.870
him, without-- He's fighting it. I don't think
he's feeling well. Can you heal him?

02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:18.331
MARISHA: I'm mean, yeah. He's going to feel it
once I cast it on him, but I can try.

02:07:18.331 --> 02:07:24.377
LAURA: He looks cold and kind of slimy, and he's
coughing a lot.

02:07:24.377 --> 02:07:28.715
TRAVIS: Wow, that's harsh. Looks cold.

02:07:28.715 --> 02:07:31.316
SAM: He's probably been up tinkering all night.

02:07:31.316 --> 02:07:34.187
LIAM: Who are you to talk, Crazy Eyes?

02:07:34.187 --> 02:07:35.236
LAURA: I know.

02:07:35.236 --> 02:07:37.500
TALIESIN: I look like like a dirty peasant right
now.

02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:38.531
LAURA: No, that's true.

02:07:38.531 --> 02:07:43.399
MARISHA: I don't know if my-- I don't know if
Greater Restoration will work.

02:07:43.399 --> 02:07:45.719
LAURA: All right.

02:07:45.719 --> 02:07:53.632
TALIESIN: Should only take 20 minutes to get to
the house, shouldn't it?

02:07:53.632 --> 02:07:54.887
MATT: Yeah. Approximately.

02:07:54.887 --> 02:07:58.445
TALIESIN: We're not passing anything interesting
on the way, are we?

02:07:58.445 --> 02:08:02.013
SAM: Any other safe houses? Potential candidates?

02:08:02.013 --> 02:08:06.350
MATT: I mean, there are plenty of houses that
currently don't show signs of life.

02:08:06.350 --> 02:08:08.843
TALIESIN: I was thinking mostly of the barracks or
the Alcove.

02:08:08.843 --> 02:08:13.088
SAM: Yes, but after we kill this thing, we're
going to need to know where to go.

02:08:13.088 --> 02:08:14.599
TALIESIN: Got some thoughts.

02:08:14.599 --> 02:08:17.762
SAM: Thoughts? We need a place to retreat to
immediately.

02:08:17.762 --> 02:08:18.889
TALIESIN: The Lady's Chamber.

02:08:18.889 --> 02:08:21.198
SAM: It's an amphitheater isn't it?

02:08:21.198 --> 02:08:24.114
TALIESIN: There's quarters. They'll be able to
hide us.

02:08:24.114 --> 02:08:26.458
MARISHA: What makes you think they're going to
hide us?

02:08:26.458 --> 02:08:27.848
TALIESIN: Hunch.

02:08:27.848 --> 02:08:31.780
SAM: Shouldn't we have a backup plan, in case they
turn us out onto the street?

02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:36.292
TALIESIN: Actually, my thought was if we take care
of Stonefell, why don't we hide in his house?

02:08:36.292 --> 02:08:39.859
LAURA: Nobody will know, right? Let's do it!

02:08:39.859 --> 02:08:41.345
SAM: That's a good plan. They probably have some
good wine.

02:08:41.345 --> 02:08:42.873
TRAVIS: I always wanted to be a lord.

02:08:42.873 --> 02:08:45.654
SAM: All right. Let's go assassinate someone.

02:08:45.654 --> 02:08:53.887
MARISHA: Percy? I don't mean to beat a dead horse
or anything, but--

02:08:53.887 --> 02:08:56.209
TALIESIN: If it would make you feel better, you
can do whatever you like,

02:08:56.209 --> 02:08:57.350
but I think it's just a tickle.

02:08:57.350 --> 02:09:01.026
MARISHA: No. You're sure about all of this?

02:09:01.026 --> 02:09:12.428
TALIESIN: This has been what I've been working for
for years. I'm not going to lose-- I was surprised

02:09:12.505 --> 02:09:17.167
last time. I've had time to think about it. I'm
going to be all right. And I'm keeping it

02:09:17.167 --> 02:09:23.699
together. I'm not going to pretend that I'm great.
But I've got a hold on it.

02:09:23.699 --> 02:09:29.471
SAM: They also have technology, now. They have
weapons, guns, that they're developing. It could

02:09:29.471 --> 02:09:31.968
be a threat to many, many other people.

02:09:31.968 --> 02:09:39.192
MARISHA: Well, that I'm fine with. No, not that
I'm fine with. I mean, I'm fine helping prevent

02:09:39.192 --> 02:09:43.506
that. I'm just more worried about your sanity than
anything else.

02:09:43.506 --> 02:09:50.689
TALIESIN: I've got a hold. And I respect that if
you think that I'm slipping, you'll let me know.

02:09:50.689 --> 02:09:57.060
MARISHA: Okay. You followed me into the fiery
abyss, so--

02:09:57.060 --> 02:10:00.725
TALIESIN: If that isn't a sign that I must be
crazy, I don't know what is.

02:10:00.725 --> 02:10:06.697
MARISHA: Touché. I'll follow you, though. I'll
follow you to the end.

02:10:06.697 --> 02:10:11.728
SAM: As the oldest among us, I say that he's
fine.

02:10:11.728 --> 02:10:14.627
TALIESIN: Are you actually the oldest among us?

02:10:14.627 --> 02:10:19.629
SAM: Well, I assume so. How old are you people?

02:10:19.629 --> 02:10:20.514
LAURA: What?

02:10:20.514 --> 02:10:21.438
TRAVIS: Me?

02:10:21.438 --> 02:10:22.380
SAM: Yeah.

02:10:22.380 --> 02:10:26.536
TRAVIS: Somewhere between one and 50.

02:10:26.536 --> 02:10:30.240
LIAM: Well, I'm 27, but I don't know how old she
is.

02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:35.053
MATT: And with that, rainfall begins to hit upon
the city--

02:10:35.053 --> 02:10:36.562
LAURA: Oh no.

02:10:36.562 --> 02:10:37.490
SAM: Let's go.

02:10:37.490 --> 02:10:41.965
MATT: The ground immediately becomes thick with
mud and sludge as you begin making your way

02:10:41.965 --> 02:10:43.491
through the city to the eastern side.

02:10:43.491 --> 02:10:45.149
MARISHA: I go puddle hopping!

02:10:45.149 --> 02:10:48.772
TALIESIN: This is not a happy place.

02:10:48.772 --> 02:10:49.713
TRAVIS: Low key.

02:10:49.713 --> 02:10:50.892
LIAM: Low key.

02:10:50.892 --> 02:10:52.279
MARISHA: Oh. I look miserable.

02:10:52.279 --> 02:10:53.475
TALIESIN: Look wet.

02:10:53.475 --> 02:10:58.975
TRAVIS: I take the Dust of Tracelessness to void
out any footprints in the mud.

02:10:58.975 --> 02:11:00.553
LIAM: It's been washed away with the rain.

02:11:00.553 --> 02:11:05.901
MATT: You do it. As you walk along, you do, some
of the mud shifts behind you. It can be a little

02:11:05.901 --> 02:11:07.570
conspicuous if you're not careful.

02:11:07.570 --> 02:11:14.121
TRAVIS: Oh. Not my normal flower girl routine;
maybe it's like the old Shawshank Prison walk.

02:11:14.121 --> 02:11:16.445
(laughter)

02:11:16.445 --> 02:11:17.941
TALIESIN: The old Shawshank Prison walk.

02:11:17.941 --> 02:11:25.678
MATT: All right. The Alcove is a little ways
north. It would take some time. You're pushing at

02:11:25.678 --> 02:11:30.570
like 10:30 in the morning at this point, around
11AM. Are you going straight to the supposed

02:11:30.570 --> 02:11:32.548
homestead of Kerrion Stonefell?

02:11:32.548 --> 02:11:33.504
LAURA: Let's do it!

02:11:33.504 --> 02:11:34.557
LIAM: We're going straight there?

02:11:34.557 --> 02:11:35.397
LAURA: Yeah.

02:11:35.397 --> 02:11:36.470
TALIESIN: We're going straight there.

02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:39.649
MATT: All right. You bee-line it. You're all
getting cold from the wet rain that is now soaked

02:11:39.649 --> 02:11:50.621
through your clothes. You make your way, and this
home is a deep, red brick in construction. This

02:11:50.621 --> 02:11:54.483
house was not here when you lived here. It looks
like what house was here has been demolished and

02:11:54.483 --> 02:12:06.254
rebuilt with sturdy masonry. It's a two-story
building. There appear to be two guards currently

02:12:06.254 --> 02:12:12.540
set outside. Two regular leather-armor looking,
more thugs than guards, but they're just both

02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:18.978
keeping under the overhang at the front porch to
keep dry and grimacing at the weather. There is a

02:12:18.978 --> 02:12:26.984
gate around it. This gate is more for purpose than
visual presentation. It's a black iron, nasty,

02:12:26.984 --> 02:12:32.337
jagged, rusty-looking gate. Not too dissimilar to
the one that surrounded the graveyard. It's about

02:12:32.337 --> 02:12:40.887
a 20-foot walk from the gate entrance to the front
step of the actual building itself. How do you

02:12:40.887 --> 02:12:42.079
want to approach this?

02:12:42.079 --> 02:12:43.699
TALIESIN: Let's walk around the back, I think.

02:12:43.699 --> 02:12:52.483
LIAM: As we walk up, I'd like to trail back by
Grog in the rain. The killing's going to start

02:12:52.483 --> 02:13:03.542
soon. It's not going to stop. We're going to
protect them. All of them.

02:13:03.542 --> 02:13:06.640
(laughter)

02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:07.932
LIAM: Yeah, big guy?

02:13:07.932 --> 02:13:09.181
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:13:09.181 --> 02:13:11.611
LIAM: All right.

02:13:11.611 --> 02:13:16.147
SAM: Vax, you have your daggers back, right?

02:13:16.147 --> 02:13:17.349
LIAM: I got them all.

02:13:17.349 --> 02:13:20.683
LAURA: I put a couple arrows in the holy oil that
we have.

02:13:20.683 --> 02:13:23.778
MATT: All right. Each holy oil is essentially
three--

02:13:23.778 --> 02:13:27.332
LAURA: Oh, can I just dip one arrow in, then, 
right now?

02:13:27.405 --> 02:13:32.981
MATT: Mark that off from one of your holy oils,
you have one of three uses of that, and that that

02:13:32.981 --> 02:13:35.832
arrow does have a holy oil essence.

02:13:35.832 --> 02:13:42.181
SAM: Percival? If we get in there, what are the
chances that this gentleman, Sir Kerrion--

02:13:42.235 --> 02:13:43.494
Korean--

02:13:43.494 --> 02:13:46.709
TALIESIN: You can mispronounce his name. It's
fine.

02:13:46.709 --> 02:13:48.006
MARISHA: Sir North Korean.

02:13:48.006 --> 02:13:49.369
TALIESIN: Sir Starbucks, yes.

02:13:49.369 --> 02:13:57.258
SAM: Sir Starbucks. What are the chances that he's
going to be in a coffin? Sleeping?

02:13:57.258 --> 02:13:58.404
TALIESIN: 50-50.

02:13:58.404 --> 02:14:00.282
SAM: Okay. All right. Good to know.

02:14:00.282 --> 02:14:05.781
TRAVIS: Would it be worthwhile to maybe say that
the little boy and the old lady were caught

02:14:05.781 --> 02:14:11.843
hoarding crops and we brought them to this guy,
see if we can draw him out of his house?

02:14:11.843 --> 02:14:14.739
SAM: Ooh, that's a cool plan. I like that plan!

02:14:14.739 --> 02:14:16.100
MARISHA: It is raining.

02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:17.577
SAM: Oh, wait, but I would be bait?

02:14:17.577 --> 02:14:18.341
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:14:18.341 --> 02:14:19.308
SAM: Okay, fine.

02:14:19.308 --> 02:14:23.017
TALIESIN: Let's take a long walk around the house
to see if there's a way in through the back.

02:14:23.017 --> 02:14:23.817
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:14:23.817 --> 02:14:24.947
MARISHA: It's dark. It's raining.

02:14:24.947 --> 02:14:28.637
TALIESIN: And I can't imagine that many people
attempt to infiltrate this house.

02:14:28.637 --> 02:14:29.893
LIAM: How dark is it?

02:14:29.893 --> 02:14:35.517
MATT: I mean, it's overcast, but it's getting
closer to noon. Even though you can't see the sun,

02:14:35.517 --> 02:14:43.371
and it is dark clouds overhead, it is still a
general universal storm light. Darkened daylight.

02:14:43.371 --> 02:14:44.677
TRAVIS: Once around?

02:14:44.677 --> 02:14:46.624
MARISHA: Does it look like it's going to pass
soon?

02:14:46.624 --> 02:14:51.131
MATT: No. It looks like it's probably going to be
here for most of the day at the very least.

02:14:51.131 --> 02:14:56.819
SAM: The rain will dampen the screams from inside.
So we go around once? Once around?

02:14:56.819 --> 02:15:02.173
MATT: Okay. Perception checks all around.

02:15:02.173 --> 02:15:03.463
SAM: Perception check.

02:15:03.463 --> 02:15:08.018
LIAM: I'm looking specifically for ways in the
building other than the front door.

02:15:08.018 --> 02:15:13.125
SAM: I'm looking for clouds because I rolled a
two.

02:15:13.125 --> 02:15:14.242
TRAVIS: Four.

02:15:14.242 --> 02:15:15.200
TALIESIN: 21.

02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:16.373
LAURA: 24.

02:15:16.373 --> 02:15:17.331
LIAM: 20.

02:15:17.331 --> 02:15:18.310
MARISHA: 21.

02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:26.621
MATT: All right. I will say above 20s, you guys
notice there is a cellar door outside the building

02:15:26.621 --> 02:15:30.741
that descends beneath it. There's no indicator as
to whether or not it's attached to the house or if

02:15:30.741 --> 02:15:37.217
it's just an exterior cellar that you can enter
from the outside. You do also see there are a

02:15:37.217 --> 02:15:41.589
number of windows around the household that are
all currently closed that lead into the interior.

02:15:41.589 --> 02:15:49.162
You're uncertain if they're locked or open.
There's a little bit of light from the inside.

02:15:49.162 --> 02:15:51.534
MARISHA: Like candlelight?

02:15:51.534 --> 02:15:56.751
MATT: Like candlelight or lantern light, the
darkened exterior has made most of the sunlight

02:15:56.751 --> 02:16:01.180
that would warm a building or light it up from the
inside has been cut off by the rainstorm. So,

02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:03.833
there is a necessity for internal lighting.

02:16:03.833 --> 02:16:08.786
MARISHA: Is there any sign of windows that are
blacked out?

02:16:08.786 --> 02:16:16.386
MATT: No, but you do notice that one of the
windows to the far back side of the building where

02:16:16.386 --> 02:16:22.085
most of the light's coming from-- occasionally the
light does seem to shift or a shadow moves past

02:16:22.085 --> 02:16:26.269
it. There's movement within that room nearish that
window.

02:16:26.269 --> 02:16:27.807
SAM: They're watching TV.

02:16:27.807 --> 02:16:32.104
LAURA: Probably. I cast Pass Without a Trace on
all of us.

02:16:32.104 --> 02:16:33.272
SAM: Ooh, thank you!

02:16:33.272 --> 02:16:35.775
MARISHA: Are we going through the cellar?

02:16:35.775 --> 02:16:38.810
SAM: Is our meal still affecting us?

02:16:38.810 --> 02:16:40.188
TALIESIN: Until two.

02:16:40.188 --> 02:16:42.163
SAM: Yes! Let's go in quick!

02:16:42.163 --> 02:16:46.624
LAURA: Is it possible to see what the movement is,
who it is inside that window?

02:16:46.624 --> 02:16:51.556
MATT: Not from this 25 to 30-foot distance from
the building and you guys trying to be

02:16:51.556 --> 02:16:52.941
inconspicuous.

02:16:52.941 --> 02:16:55.763
LIAM: There's nothing between us and the
building?

02:16:55.763 --> 02:17:03.884
MATT: There is the gate. The gate, and what looks
to be a few rocks and a couple small trees that

02:17:03.884 --> 02:17:07.916
are on the actual grounds of the house surrounding
it.

02:17:07.916 --> 02:17:12.303
LAURA: Is the cellar door hidden from view of
everything or is it out in the open?

02:17:12.303 --> 02:17:13.507
MATT: Which one?

02:17:13.507 --> 02:17:14.913
LAURA: The cellar door that we saw.

02:17:14.913 --> 02:17:19.216
MATT: The cellar door is out in the open,
buttressed against the back of the house. It's up against

02:17:19.216 --> 02:17:22.940
the ground on the side. It has two doors that open
up and lead into the cellar below.

02:17:23.008 --> 02:17:25.582
LAURA: Does it look like anybody can see us?

02:17:25.582 --> 02:17:30.291
MATT: From where you're standing? No. You're going
to be hardpressed to get across without being in

02:17:30.291 --> 02:17:32.282
sight of somebody if someone were nearby.

02:17:32.282 --> 02:17:35.354
MARISHA: We're between a fence, right?

02:17:35.354 --> 02:17:36.798
MATT: You're on the outside of a fence.

02:17:36.798 --> 02:17:42.720
TRAVIS: Do we want to try to draw them out or get
to the cellar? Either way, those two thug guards

02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:43.953
are going to die.

02:17:43.953 --> 02:17:45.065
MARISHA: There are guards?

02:17:45.065 --> 02:17:46.385
LAURA and SAM: There's two guards.

02:17:46.385 --> 02:17:49.905
MATT: They're currently not in visual range of
you. They're guarding the front of the building.

02:17:49.905 --> 02:17:52.514
You guys moved around back. So you don't see the
two guards currently on the

02:17:52.514 --> 02:17:53.831
opposite side of the house.

02:17:53.831 --> 02:17:55.784
TRAVIS: What's the fence made out of? Is it the
spear-y shit?

02:17:55.784 --> 02:17:57.613
MARISHA: Is it poky up top?

02:17:57.613 --> 02:17:58.572
MATT: It is poky. yes.

02:17:58.572 --> 02:17:59.555
TRAVIS: It is poky.

02:17:59.555 --> 02:18:02.168
MATT: It's not super sharp poky, but there's iron
rods.

02:18:02.168 --> 02:18:03.749
TRAVIS: So, I could throw Scanlan over.

02:18:03.749 --> 02:18:05.216
LIAM: If you roll a two, you can get hurt.

02:18:05.216 --> 02:18:08.627
MATT: Yeah, if you rolled poorly, it's going to
deal some damage.

02:18:08.765 --> 02:18:11.197
SAM: Should we do a diversion for the guards?

02:18:11.369 --> 02:18:12.767
LAURA: They can't even see us, though!

02:18:12.767 --> 02:18:15.810
SAM: Yes, but once we go through the fence, they
might. I don't know.

02:18:15.810 --> 02:18:17.297
All right, you want to sneak in?

02:18:17.297 --> 02:18:23.173
TALIESIN: Let's try to sneak in and leave the
guards there unless they notice us and then we'll

02:18:23.173 --> 02:18:24.464
just (thwip thwip).

02:18:24.464 --> 02:18:25.553
SAM: All right, sure!

02:18:25.553 --> 02:18:27.981
TRAVIS: How do we sneak in past them?

02:18:27.981 --> 02:18:30.490
TALIESIN: You want to try to pull one of the
wrought irons off, maybe?

02:18:30.490 --> 02:18:32.122
TRAVIS: I'd be down for that.

02:18:32.122 --> 02:18:39.809
SAM: If I puffed some smoke, would it draw
attention to us?

02:18:39.809 --> 02:18:40.753
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:18:40.753 --> 02:18:42.298
SAM: Okay, then never mind.

02:18:42.298 --> 02:18:45.489
TALIESIN: It's raining. We can make a little
noise, it'll be okay.

02:18:45.489 --> 02:18:47.208
LIAM: Where are the guards in the front?

02:18:47.208 --> 02:18:49.526
MATT: They're currently on the opposite side of
the building. If you guys are looking at the back.

02:18:49.526 --> 02:18:51.642
They're in the front of the building guarding the
front door.

02:18:51.642 --> 02:18:53.915
LIAM: Inside the gate at the house?

02:18:53.915 --> 02:18:54.925
MATT: Correct.

02:18:54.925 --> 02:18:57.186
MARISHA: Want me to heat up that metal bar for
you?

02:18:57.186 --> 02:19:00.689
LIAM: We still have to go over and in.

02:19:00.689 --> 02:19:01.897
TRAVIS: Sure.

02:19:01.897 --> 02:19:05.721
LAURA: Let's just up and over the bar,
athletic it. Acrobatics it?

02:19:05.721 --> 02:19:08.537
LIAM: Grog, can you bend that shit open?

02:19:08.537 --> 02:19:10.952
MATT: Your donkey's still there beside you.

02:19:10.952 --> 02:19:12.056
LAURA: Fuck!

02:19:12.056 --> 02:19:14.767
LIAM: Yeah, well, if Grog can frigging make a hole
in there--

02:19:14.767 --> 02:19:16.744
TRAVIS: Can I try and Lou Ferrigno those bars?

02:19:16.744 --> 02:19:18.855
MATT: You're more than welcome to. Go ahead and
make a strength check.

02:19:18.915 --> 02:19:20.181
MARISHA: The bar that he's--

02:19:20.181 --> 02:19:22.261
TALIESIN: Lou Ferrigno-ing.

02:19:22.261 --> 02:19:26.929
MARISHA: -- Lou Ferrigno-ing, I'm going to cast Heat
Metal.

02:19:27.029 --> 02:19:29.155
SAM: Is that going to burn his hands?

02:19:29.155 --> 02:19:30.572
MARISHA: Put on some gloves.

02:19:30.572 --> 02:19:31.917
TRAVIS: I don't have any gloves.

02:19:31.917 --> 02:19:34.427
MARISHA: Spit in your hand a little bit. Grip and
bear it.

02:19:34.427 --> 02:19:35.702
SAM: It's raining. It'll be fine.

02:19:35.702 --> 02:19:42.372
MATT: So, you cast Heat Metal on the bars and a
certain area of this gate begins to glow with a

02:19:42.372 --> 02:19:50.301
dull orange to become a brighter orange, and
portions of it going whitish-hot in places.

02:19:50.301 --> 02:19:51.920
SAM: Why don't you just hit it with something?

02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:52.982
LAURA: Wrap your hands.

02:19:52.982 --> 02:19:54.523
MARISHA: You can use your axe.

02:19:54.523 --> 02:20:00.381
MATT: The rain, by the way, is puffing against it
and evaporating as it

02:20:00.381 --> 02:20:02.135
impacts the now-heated metal.

02:20:02.135 --> 02:20:03.244
SAM: But that'll be loud!

02:20:03.244 --> 02:20:04.644
MARISHA: You do you! You do you, Grog.

02:20:04.644 --> 02:20:05.785
TRAVIS: I rolled a 23.

02:20:05.785 --> 02:20:13.751
MATT: 23? Okay, you reach over and grab it, your
hands smoking on the-- use the pain! Use the pain

02:20:13.751 --> 02:20:21.035
and pull down the bars. You get a large portion of
the gate to actually bend downward into an arc,

02:20:21.035 --> 02:20:26.328
causing the whole gate to fold inward on that
side, making it much easier for anyone to pass

02:20:26.328 --> 02:20:33.897
through. However, you do suffer nine points of
fire damage from the burn and your hands are

02:20:33.897 --> 02:20:35.433
currently scalded.

02:20:35.433 --> 02:20:36.871
TALIESIN: Now we can get Trinket in!

02:20:36.871 --> 02:20:38.815
LIAM: That's a hangnail on his pinky toe.

02:20:38.815 --> 02:20:40.854
TRAVIS: It's all right.

02:20:40.854 --> 02:20:45.442
MARISHA: I go ahead and I cast Healing Word on his
hands.

02:20:45.442 --> 02:20:51.802
MATT: Okay. So it's 1d4 plus six. She's rolling
it.

02:20:51.802 --> 02:20:53.702
MARISHA: Ooh! 11.

02:20:53.702 --> 02:20:54.925
TRAVIS: Hey, back to full!

02:20:54.925 --> 02:21:02.123
MATT: So, the scarring stays for a bit. You do
smell the burning flesh, but there's no lasting

02:21:02.123 --> 02:21:03.402
wounds on your hands.

02:21:03.402 --> 02:21:09.591
TALIESIN: You can check to see if there's a lock
on the cellar door?

02:21:09.591 --> 02:21:10.745
LIAM: Yeah, sure.

02:21:10.745 --> 02:21:12.329
TRAVIS: We gotta make it across the lawn first.

02:21:12.329 --> 02:21:13.498
LAURA: Well, we're in the back of the house.

02:21:13.498 --> 02:21:15.040
LIAM: Well, we're all just walking very quietly.

02:21:15.040 --> 02:21:16.140
LAURA: We're stealthing.

02:21:16.140 --> 02:21:17.824
MATT: So, everyone make a stealth check.

02:21:17.824 --> 02:21:19.060
TALIESIN: We have advantage?

02:21:19.060 --> 02:21:23.352
MATT: No, everyone gets plus ten to their stealth.
You have disadvantage

02:21:23.352 --> 02:21:24.662
on the stealth check, though.

02:21:24.662 --> 02:21:25.680
SAM: Plus ten.

02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:27.551
MATT: Yes, plus ten to your stealth roll.

02:21:27.551 --> 02:21:29.782
SAM: 17.

02:21:29.782 --> 02:21:32.155
TRAVIS: 23.

02:21:32.155 --> 02:21:33.088
LIAM: 34.

02:21:33.088 --> 02:21:35.083
LAURA: 32.

02:21:35.083 --> 02:21:36.928
MARISHA: 34.

02:21:36.928 --> 02:21:38.004
TALIESIN: 26!

02:21:38.004 --> 02:21:46.648
MATT: All righty. You guys all keeping low and
quickly darting across the grass field. You make

02:21:46.648 --> 02:21:51.592
your way, pattering across the somewhat slick
grass. The rain is a little warmer than the frost

02:21:51.592 --> 02:21:57.046
that kept the grounds frozen as the morning came
to. So, it's a little slick, but you make your way

02:21:57.046 --> 02:22:01.001
to the back of the building. You're still loosely
out in the open, in a weird way, so you don't want

02:22:01.001 --> 02:22:04.489
to be out in the open for a long period of time.
This isn't a safe place. You're currently,

02:22:04.489 --> 02:22:09.151
apparently made it to this side of the building
unnoticed. But you don't want to stay here very

02:22:09.224 --> 02:22:13.675
long because you are visible to anyone who's on
either side of the gate exterior.

02:22:13.675 --> 02:22:16.352
LIAM: I'm going straight to the cellar door.

02:22:16.352 --> 02:22:18.094
LAURA: Up against the wall of the building.

02:22:18.094 --> 02:22:21.884
LIAM: I give it a little (clunk) to see what I
feel.

02:22:21.884 --> 02:22:23.936
MATT: It is locked. It does gives resistance.

02:22:23.936 --> 02:22:25.021
LIAM: I get to work.

02:22:25.021 --> 02:22:26.306
MARISHA: Do your thing.

02:22:26.306 --> 02:22:30.519
LAURA: I feel like it's been a while since you've
done this.

02:22:30.519 --> 02:22:31.507
LIAM: Did what?

02:22:31.507 --> 02:22:32.525
LAURA: Lockpicking.

02:22:32.525 --> 02:22:37.098
LIAM: I already did it earlier when you
weren't here. 14, that's 27.

02:22:37.143 --> 02:22:40.127
MATT: 27. You reach over, without even looking.
You grab the lock; you're familiar with this kind

02:22:40.127 --> 02:22:46.359
of lock. (clicking) You take the lock off the
chain. The chains fall loose against the opposite

02:22:46.359 --> 02:22:54.309
side of the, or the inside of the door. You pull
it open. It's dark inside. You can see the dry

02:22:54.309 --> 02:22:59.393
stone steps that lead down below the building as
rain starts darkening them with drops that are

02:22:59.393 --> 02:23:00.380
hitting them.

02:23:00.380 --> 02:23:03.978
LIAM: I lean my head in really fast and just see
if I can hear anything, and roll a one.

02:23:03.978 --> 02:23:10.278
LAURA: Could I stealth in a couple of steps look
around and see if there's anybody in there, or

02:23:10.278 --> 02:23:11.123
hear anything?

02:23:11.123 --> 02:23:12.580
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

02:23:12.580 --> 02:23:19.743
LIAM: No, I said it's good! It's good! Let's go!
Right? You agree. We're never wrong!

02:23:19.814 --> 02:23:21.131
LAURA: 19.

02:23:21.131 --> 02:23:26.645
MATT: 19. Listening to the inside. The smell's a
little musty, like a cellar you'd expect. But a

02:23:26.645 --> 02:23:31.924
little bit of dust and untouched earth. There's
nothing down there; no movement, no sound.

02:23:31.966 --> 02:23:36.634
LAURA: It's clear, let's go! Ish!

02:23:36.679 --> 02:23:42.502
MATT: You all drop in. Darting into-- which is
good, because you notice around the corner one of

02:23:42.502 --> 02:23:47.790
the giants is turning the corner. You all dive
inside, close the cellar doors. Bringing you to

02:23:47.838 --> 02:23:49.231
the interior.

02:23:49.231 --> 02:23:50.874
LAURA: I wonder if they're going to notice that
fence.

02:23:50.874 --> 02:23:51.911
SAM: They might.

02:23:51.911 --> 02:23:56.648
MATT: You hear the pattering of rain across the
wooden doors of the cellar. You made your way down

02:23:56.648 --> 02:24:01.947
underneath. And it is pitch black. There is no
light source down here.

02:24:02.122 --> 02:24:04.655
LIAM: I pull out my Flametongue Dagger.

02:24:04.655 --> 02:24:07.030
MATT: Okay. A little bit of flame causes enough
candlelight to see the surface.

02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:08.726
And it is a wine cellar.

02:24:08.726 --> 02:24:09.909
TRAVIS: I have Darkvision.

02:24:09.909 --> 02:24:12.587
MARISHA: I'll go ahead and use my flaming hands.

02:24:12.587 --> 02:24:18.077
MATT: Okay, so with an instant of will, all of a
sudden flames burst around--

02:24:18.077 --> 02:25:34.167
[no audio]

02:25:34.198 --> 02:25:39.020
MATT: -- is a small ladder in the corner that seems
to lead up to a latched door that leads to the

02:25:39.020 --> 02:25:40.329
interior of the house.

02:25:40.329 --> 02:25:42.217
LAURA: I got up to it and listen.

02:25:42.217 --> 02:25:43.864
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:25:43.864 --> 02:25:51.316
LAURA: I don't hear anything, you guys.
I think it's fine!

02:25:51.372 --> 02:25:54.601
LIAM: My ears are bigger than yours. Let me have a
listen. Get down.

02:25:54.601 --> 02:25:56.774
LAURA: Yeah! Your ears are huge compared to mine!

02:25:56.774 --> 02:25:58.211
LIAM: Definitely, look at them!

02:25:58.211 --> 02:26:01.642
MATT: Your sister assures you she heard--

02:26:01.642 --> 02:26:03.171
LAURA: There's nothing there!

02:26:03.171 --> 02:26:05.553
LIAM: I don't hear anything, either. I think we
should just bust in.

02:26:05.553 --> 02:26:06.469
SAM: Okay!

02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:07.456
TRAVIS: Wait.

02:26:07.456 --> 02:26:08.556
TALIESIN: (whispers) Quietly!

02:26:08.556 --> 02:26:12.238
MARISHA: Wait, hang on! Grog just said wait!

02:26:12.238 --> 02:26:15.665
LIAM: I keep forgetting the rogue skill, so really
I rolled a 20.

02:26:15.665 --> 02:26:19.559
SAM: Wait, what? You rolled a three and it becomes
a 20?!

02:26:19.559 --> 02:26:24.732
LIAM: For perception, I can no longer roll lower
than ten, unless I roll a one. But if it's a two

02:26:24.732 --> 02:26:27.843
or nine, it's actually a ten for me.

02:26:27.843 --> 02:26:29.130
LAURA: That's awesome.

02:26:29.130 --> 02:26:30.539
MATT: Rogues are pretty cool.

02:26:30.539 --> 02:26:31.540
TALIESIN: That's crazy.

02:26:31.540 --> 02:26:32.704
LAURA: Yep, rogues are awesome.

02:26:32.704 --> 02:26:33.976
TRAVIS: Rogues are whatever.

02:26:33.976 --> 02:26:38.943
MATT: So you put your ear up to it and listen
carefully. And you hear pacing footsteps creaking

02:26:38.943 --> 02:26:42.290
against wood no more than maybe four feet away
from you.

02:26:42.290 --> 02:26:43.603
LIAM: Is that one person?

02:26:43.603 --> 02:26:49.021
MATT: One person stops and then moves again, then
moves again almost like there's pacing, and you

02:26:49.021 --> 02:26:56.934
hear low voices. It's a conversation; there's two
voices. You hear one voice very muffled, but it

02:26:56.934 --> 02:27:01.525
seems to be similar to the voice of the gentleman
that came across you guys on the street that

02:27:01.525 --> 02:27:04.700
actually briefly talked to Percy the day before.

02:27:04.700 --> 02:27:06.311
LIAM: The old guy; the balding guy?

02:27:06.311 --> 02:27:08.843
MATT: The balding guy with the long stringy gray
hair.

02:27:08.843 --> 02:27:11.449
LIAM: He's just reporting in. He's his frigging
money collector.

02:27:11.449 --> 02:27:13.740
MATT: The other voice you don't recognize, and
it's too muffled for you to make out anything.

02:27:13.740 --> 02:27:21.094
About four feet from you, not over the cellar, but
off a ways to it. You're not certain where this

02:27:21.094 --> 02:27:28.228
doorway leads to, the level of muffling you can
hear through the floor leads you to believe that

02:27:28.228 --> 02:27:29.800
they're not directly above you.

02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:36.250
LIAM: Not directly above. All right. There's
nobody right above us,

02:27:36.250 --> 02:27:37.832
but there's people in the house.

02:27:37.832 --> 02:27:39.984
LAURA: They might be close.

02:27:39.984 --> 02:27:41.255
TRAVIS: Just to be clear--

02:27:41.255 --> 02:27:44.736
LIAM: No, they're on another floor or in another
room.

02:27:44.736 --> 02:27:48.467
TRAVIS: Before we start: we're killing everything,
right?

02:27:48.467 --> 02:27:49.463
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:27:49.463 --> 02:27:54.490
TRAVIS: Okay, good. Do we want to send one person
out sneaky and then have a code word like Cheeto

02:27:54.490 --> 02:27:55.868
if it all goes wrong?

02:27:55.868 --> 02:27:59.506
MARISHA: Last time we did that, it went really
well.

02:27:59.506 --> 02:28:01.033
TRAVIS: Did we do that before?

02:28:01.033 --> 02:28:03.391
LIAM: No, we didn't send anyone, I just--

02:28:03.391 --> 02:28:05.063
TALIESIN: Let's just go one room at a time.

02:28:05.063 --> 02:28:07.877
SAM: One room at a time? We have to get up 
through this latch

02:28:07.877 --> 02:28:09.532
and there's people right above us!

02:28:09.532 --> 02:28:12.948
LIAM: Scanlan, you or me? You want to go
invisible, or do you want me to creep in?

02:28:12.948 --> 02:28:19.739
SAM: I think you should have some fun, too. But
before we do anything, do you want me to send a

02:28:19.739 --> 02:28:23.014
cloud up there of gross smoke to smoke out the
area?

02:28:23.067 --> 02:28:24.459
LIAM and TALIESIN: No.

02:28:24.459 --> 02:28:26.216
TALIESIN: Let's not let them know we're here.

02:28:26.216 --> 02:28:35.077
LAURA: Wait, before we do this. Keyleth, can you
maybe make the gate outside not look like it's all

02:28:35.077 --> 02:28:36.652
bent to shit?

02:28:36.652 --> 02:28:41.242
LIAM: Zombie guards aren't going to-- giants are
stupid.

02:28:41.242 --> 02:28:42.370
SAM: It'll be fine.

02:28:42.370 --> 02:28:45.474
LIAM: They're stupid. I mean, there are the guys
out front.

02:28:45.474 --> 02:28:46.453
LAURA: Yeah.

02:28:46.453 --> 02:28:47.936
TRAVIS: It's fine!

02:28:47.936 --> 02:28:54.564
SAM: What could go wrong? This is a stealth
mission. We'll be in and out of here in six

02:28:54.564 --> 02:28:56.758
minutes if we do this right. Let's go! Go, go!

02:28:56.758 --> 02:29:00.768
MARISHA: Wait, are you going in? Are you
infiltrating?

02:29:00.768 --> 02:29:04.316
LIAM: I'll go up and see what I see. Just above
us, not far away.

02:29:04.316 --> 02:29:16.622
MARISHA: I touch Vax's shoulder and I cast Enhance
Ability and I'm going to give you dex saves-- what

02:29:16.622 --> 02:29:17.801
do you want?

02:29:17.801 --> 02:29:21.861
LIAM: I'm good on that.

02:29:21.861 --> 02:29:27.115
MARISHA: What do you want advantage on?

02:29:27.115 --> 02:29:34.287
LIAM: Not dexterity. Constitution. I'm feeling a
little weak.

02:29:34.287 --> 02:29:35.877
MARISHA: All right. Constitution.

02:29:35.877 --> 02:29:37.524
MATT: What's this for?

02:29:37.524 --> 02:29:49.630
MARISHA: Enhance Ability. So I think it's called
Bear's Constitution or something weird.

02:29:49.690 --> 02:29:53.689
MATT: Advantage on constitution checks. Those are
different from saving throws.

02:29:53.689 --> 02:29:55.858
LAURA: Oh.

02:29:55.903 --> 02:29:57.185
MARISHA: Checks.

02:29:57.185 --> 02:30:00.806
MATT: But it does give him 2d6 temporary hit
points, but those do not stack with the current

02:30:00.806 --> 02:30:04.735
temporary hit points you have. Constitution would
not be of much benefit to you.

02:30:04.735 --> 02:30:07.191
TRAVIS: We could just set a fire down here.

02:30:07.191 --> 02:30:09.978
MARISHA: Okay. Do you want dex or anything?

02:30:09.978 --> 02:30:13.341
LIAM: I'm pretty dex-y already.

02:30:13.341 --> 02:30:19.204
MARISHA: Instead, I say, good luck.

02:30:19.204 --> 02:30:24.561
SAM: Bonne chance! Vive la résistance!

02:30:24.561 --> 02:30:25.478
TRAVIS: All right.

02:30:25.478 --> 02:30:30.566
LIAM: I'm going to check and see if it gives at
all or if there's anything to it.

02:30:30.566 --> 02:30:31.911
MATT: (creak) It gives.

02:30:31.911 --> 02:30:33.765
LIAM: It gives. All right, so I'm going to go up.

02:30:33.765 --> 02:30:35.195
TRAVIS: Invisible or not?

02:30:35.195 --> 02:30:44.044
LIAM: No, stealthing up. All right. So, okay,
hold on, I get advantage. 23.

02:30:44.113 --> 02:30:48.441
LAURA: Wait, no. Plus ten because Pass Without a
Trace.

02:30:48.503 --> 02:30:49.556
LIAM: Oh, 33.

02:30:49.556 --> 02:30:56.015
MATT: 33. You move it up, without a sound, dart
up, catch yourself and lower it down carefully.

02:30:56.015 --> 02:30:59.955
Dark interior, you use your Flametongue Dagger to
look inside. You are inside of a closet of some

02:30:59.955 --> 02:31:07.777
kind, a ten by five closet. There are coats and
outfits around you. You can push them aside. This

02:31:07.777 --> 02:31:13.554
looks to be like a small storage room that has
been repurposed as a closet of some kind.

02:31:13.554 --> 02:31:18.009
LIAM: I am listening intently and feeling through
as many pockets as I can find around me.

02:31:18.009 --> 02:31:22.906
MATT: Easily enough. As you put your ear to the
door, they are talking immediately on the other

02:31:22.906 --> 02:31:27.673
side of this door. You are a room adjacent to it.
You do manage to pocket from a few of the coats

02:31:27.673 --> 02:31:32.060
about 47 gold pieces in total.

02:31:32.060 --> 02:31:35.940
MARISHA: Who leaves that much in their coat
pockets?

02:31:35.940 --> 02:31:38.657
TRAVIS: Dead people, that's who.

02:31:38.657 --> 02:31:41.744
LIAM: Can I make anything out through there?

02:31:41.744 --> 02:31:48.773
MATT: You make out conversation. It seems to be
between a voice you don't recognize and the

02:31:48.773 --> 02:31:54.860
gentleman earlier you met, basically saying,
"With everything that's going on now, it's honestly

02:31:54.921 --> 02:32:02.710
"very frustrating that these people wouldn't do
their share of the bargain. I, myself, I've been

02:32:02.710 --> 02:32:07.416
"doing my best to keep them in order, but at this
point in time, I think we need to do another show

02:32:07.416 --> 02:32:14.202
"of strength in order to keep them working as hard
as we have been." Another voice calms him down and

02:32:14.202 --> 02:32:22.230
says, "Don't worry, don't worry. Keep it under
control. At the very least, we should have to be

02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:30.730
"ready, prepared. If what Lady Briarwood says, we
should be having visitors any day now. And I would

02:32:30.800 --> 02:32:38.668
"hate to be caught flat-footed. So, we're going to
go ahead and gather our arms, going to make sure

02:32:38.668 --> 02:32:46.938
"that we outfit the place the best we can. Traps,
alarms, whatever is necessary to make sure that we

02:32:46.938 --> 02:32:48.588
"are not caught off-guard."

02:32:48.588 --> 02:32:50.776
(laughter)

02:32:50.776 --> 02:32:52.454
MARISHA: This is about to be hilarious!

02:32:52.454 --> 02:32:58.414
MATT: You guys came at just about the right time.

02:32:58.483 --> 02:33:06.477
LIAM: I'd like to-- everybody hold.

02:33:06.477 --> 02:33:07.971
SAM: Hold?

02:33:07.971 --> 02:33:08.667
LAURA: Hold.

02:33:08.667 --> 02:33:12.365
LIAM: I just want to wait for one minute and see
what progresses.

02:33:12.430 --> 02:33:22.406
MATT: Okay. The conversation continues. The older
gentleman begins talking about, "I don't like the

02:33:22.406 --> 02:33:30.117
"idea of there being any sort of conflict on our
home turf. I wish they would just meet them out,

02:33:30.197 --> 02:33:35.057
"head them off, cut them off at the head. Why did
we invite them in here? That seems to be a

02:33:35.057 --> 02:33:36.535
"dangerous circumstance."

02:33:36.535 --> 02:33:40.267
LIAM: While they're talking I say: we've got two
gentlemen up here.

02:33:40.336 --> 02:33:41.849
SAM: Two gentlemen!

02:33:41.849 --> 02:33:44.030
LAURA: Okay. I start climbing the--

02:33:44.030 --> 02:33:46.646
LIAM: I think it's time to start killing.

02:33:46.646 --> 02:33:49.507
SAM: Grog up first!

02:33:49.507 --> 02:33:51.760
MARISHA: Places everyone, places!

02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:53.316
LAURA: Grog up before me.

02:33:53.316 --> 02:33:55.756
TRAVIS: It's opening night and I'm so excited!

02:33:55.756 --> 02:33:59.145
(laughter)

02:33:59.145 --> 02:34:00.501
MATT: Stealth checks all around.

02:34:00.501 --> 02:34:02.396
LAURA: Plus ten!

02:34:02.396 --> 02:34:05.795
LIAM: Send up the goliath.

02:34:05.795 --> 02:34:07.093
MARISHA: That's good!

02:34:07.093 --> 02:34:09.987
TRAVIS: 29!

02:34:09.987 --> 02:34:14.561
SAM: 18.

02:34:14.561 --> 02:34:15.565
LAURA: Plus ten!

02:34:15.565 --> 02:34:17.013
SAM: That was plus ten.

02:34:17.013 --> 02:34:18.028
MARISHA: 32.

02:34:18.028 --> 02:34:19.083
TALIESIN: 28.

02:34:19.083 --> 02:34:20.174
LAURA: 34.

02:34:20.174 --> 02:34:24.779
MATT: All righty. You all slowly make your way up.
There's not enough room for all of you inside this

02:34:24.779 --> 02:34:28.043
room, this storage space.

02:34:28.043 --> 02:34:29.544
LAURA: Grog first.

02:34:29.544 --> 02:34:37.704
MATT: Grog, you go up, you push open the door into
the next room and it is a-- for lack of a better

02:34:37.704 --> 02:34:41.228
term, a music room. There's a few couches around,
there's a piano set up.

02:34:41.228 --> 02:34:43.376
LIAM: Oh, it went closet to music room?

02:34:43.376 --> 02:34:44.210
MATT: Yeah.

02:34:44.210 --> 02:34:45.504
MARISHA: Oh, we're opening the door?

02:34:45.504 --> 02:34:51.559
MATT: You guys are opening a door to a room next
to-- the wall you were listening to is the room

02:34:51.559 --> 02:34:56.802
next to you. This opens up into a room adjacent.

02:34:56.802 --> 02:34:59.722
MARISHA: A music room! How regal!

02:34:59.722 --> 02:35:05.120
MATT: So, as you push out into the room, it's dark
in here. The only light that's coming in is from

02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:09.934
the nearby window. A little bit of sun's coming
through from the rainstorm. You can still hear the

02:35:09.934 --> 02:35:17.316
rain pattering on the window and the second floor
above you, there is no sound from the rain hitting

02:35:17.316 --> 02:35:18.725
the roof from this distance.

02:35:18.725 --> 02:35:21.269
LIAM: Dart my eyes around. Is there anything
that's useful in here?

02:35:21.269 --> 02:35:24.122
MATT: Not particularly; it's mostly decorative.
Few vases, some books on the shelf. There is a

02:35:24.199 --> 02:35:27.310
door that is partially open that leads into
hallway. A hallway

02:35:27.310 --> 02:35:29.322
that seems to connect the two rooms.

02:35:29.322 --> 02:35:30.893
LIAM: Which way are the voices coming from?

02:35:30.893 --> 02:35:39.524
MATT: Yeah. The door is the opposite of the window
and the room that you're in is adjacent to the

02:35:39.524 --> 02:35:42.054
room that the voices are coming from. The closet
is in between the two.

02:35:42.054 --> 02:35:45.116
LIAM: Oh, between the two. So it is out, door,
hallway?

02:35:45.116 --> 02:35:50.318
MATT: Yes, out, door, hallway, and then the room
where the speaking is coming from.

02:35:50.318 --> 02:35:59.646
SAM: Do you want me to create a diversion of some
sort? No?

02:35:59.726 --> 02:36:01.363
LAURA: Just run in, surprise him.

02:36:01.363 --> 02:36:02.478
SAM: Are we going to go around?

02:36:02.478 --> 02:36:03.819
LIAM: So, we're stealthing, right?

02:36:03.819 --> 02:36:04.583
MATT: Yeah.

02:36:04.583 --> 02:36:07.211
LIAM: So I pull both of their hands and I say--

02:36:07.211 --> 02:36:08.223
SAM: Who's they?

02:36:08.223 --> 02:36:14.953
LIAM: Grog and Keyleth. I start pulling them
through-- that's all right. Out the door. Along

02:36:14.953 --> 02:36:16.984
the hallway towards the voices.

02:36:16.984 --> 02:36:18.361
MATT: All right.

02:36:18.361 --> 02:36:20.997
TALIESIN: Matt, that's a lot of maps you have down
there.

02:36:20.997 --> 02:36:27.410
LAURA: Really? Really?! I'm offended. And I'm
hurt.

02:36:27.410 --> 02:36:32.353
MARISHA: I look back at Vex and I just go--

02:36:32.353 --> 02:36:35.052
LAURA: I give you the worst evil eye I've ever
given anyone.

02:36:35.052 --> 02:36:37.820
LIAM: Too bad one's going that way and the other's
going that way.

02:36:37.820 --> 02:36:46.511
SAM: As they go, I quickly lock eyes with Grog and
I give him a quick little inspiration.

02:36:46.511 --> 02:36:53.735
(singing) Blood, glorious blood! Grog's 
about to take some. Dead dudettes and dudes,

02:36:53.866 --> 02:36:56.656
Grog's about to make some!

02:36:56.656 --> 02:36:58.694
(laughter)

02:36:58.694 --> 02:37:04.471
MATT: All right, so take a d10 inspiration die.
So, the three of you move on ahead. The rest of

02:37:04.471 --> 02:37:07.064
you-- Trinket is unable to climb.

02:37:07.064 --> 02:37:12.627
SAM: Oh! Can I? Trinket: stay.

02:37:12.627 --> 02:37:15.441
(laughter)

02:37:15.441 --> 02:37:21.432
LAURA: I smack the back of your head again. And
it's hard because I'm angry right now.

02:37:21.432 --> 02:37:26.649
TRAVIS: Do you have any of your rings on? Turn
them inside and (impact noise).

02:37:26.649 --> 02:37:30.413
MARISHA: It's the mom slap, exactly! It's the
grandma backhand.

02:37:30.413 --> 02:37:40.414
MATT: All right, the three of you stand at the
double doors. You moved around to the hallway. Is

02:37:40.414 --> 02:37:46.519
there a change to this arrangement that you would
like? You currently have Grog, Vax, and Keyleth at

02:37:46.519 --> 02:37:49.169
the front, and three of you in the back.

02:37:49.169 --> 02:37:52.120
LAURA: Yeah, I want to stealth in behind Grog
after they go into the room.

02:37:52.120 --> 02:37:58.228
MATT: All right, so there you are. I'll put you on the
side of the door there. You hear the voices from

02:37:58.288 --> 02:38:02.950
the other side of the door conversing and talking
back and forth. Scanlan, Percy.

02:38:02.950 --> 02:38:06.629
MARISHA: Oh my god. Someone say something cool!

02:38:06.629 --> 02:38:07.958
MATT: What's the plan?

02:38:07.958 --> 02:38:10.449
LIAM: I put my hand up in the air.

02:38:10.449 --> 02:38:12.496
SAM: de Rolos, roll out!

02:38:12.496 --> 02:38:16.704
LIAM: And I click my boots together. (click) Feel
that adrenaline rush.

02:38:16.704 --> 02:38:17.980
TRAVIS: I rage.

02:38:17.980 --> 02:38:23.089
LIAM: And I kick the door as hard as I can and go
right in!

02:38:23.089 --> 02:38:26.891
MARISHA, TALIESIN, and SAM: (scream and cheer)

02:38:26.891 --> 02:38:32.271
MATT: (impact noise) The door swings open, both of
them slamming into the sides of these two

02:38:32.271 --> 02:38:39.477
bookcases. Immediately, you see behind the desk
here and standing in the center.

02:38:39.477 --> 02:38:41.288
LIAM: It's Kiefer Sutherland.

02:38:41.288 --> 02:38:48.520
MATT: You see the older gentleman in these long
robes immediately spin his head and see,

02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:55.122
essentially, a troupe of armed villagers,
peasants, dirty faces come rushing in. all fucked

02:38:55.122 --> 02:39:02.760
up eyes and all. Rushing into the room. They both
turn, looking completely caught off-guard by this.

02:39:02.760 --> 02:39:07.779
You do also see in the room, there are a few
guards that are just waiting off to the side.

02:39:07.779 --> 02:39:09.442
There's a couch area, there's a fireplace.

02:39:09.442 --> 02:39:11.611
MARISHA: Of course. Damn guards.

02:39:11.611 --> 02:39:15.365
MATT: You guys get a surprise round.

02:39:15.365 --> 02:39:16.673
MARISHA: That's right!

02:39:16.673 --> 02:39:20.405
MATT: So, let's go ahead and roll initiative to
get the order of things here.

02:39:20.405 --> 02:39:25.249
TRAVIS: Advantage on initiative because I have
that thing.

02:39:25.249 --> 02:39:28.599
SAM: Are you alert? Do you have Alert? Is that
what it is?

02:39:28.599 --> 02:39:29.953
TRAVIS: I have Feral Instinct.

02:39:29.953 --> 02:39:31.090
SAM: Ooh!

02:39:31.090 --> 02:39:35.637
TRAVIS: Which I forget sometimes. That's better.

02:39:35.706 --> 02:39:45.291
SAM and LAURA: (sing with the battle music)

02:39:45.291 --> 02:39:47.381
MATT: All right, so 25 to 20?

02:39:47.439 --> 02:39:49.147
TRAVIS: 20!

02:39:49.147 --> 02:39:51.513
TALIESIN: 23.

02:39:51.513 --> 02:39:57.646
MATT: All right. 20 to 15?

02:39:57.646 --> 02:39:59.107
SAM: 16!

02:39:59.107 --> 02:40:01.550
LAURA: Whoa! Look at you, Scanlan!

02:40:01.550 --> 02:40:04.971
SAM: Better figure out what I'm going to do!

02:40:04.971 --> 02:40:14.959
MATT: So, Scanlan is 16. 15 to ten?

02:40:14.959 --> 02:40:16.036
LIAM: 13.

02:40:16.036 --> 02:40:16.975
LAURA: 13.

02:40:16.975 --> 02:40:18.149
MARISHA: 13.

02:40:18.149 --> 02:40:21.775
LIAM: Half-elves!

02:40:21.775 --> 02:40:26.982
MATT: Ten to five? Is that everyone?

02:40:26.982 --> 02:40:28.295
LAURA: That's all of us.

02:40:28.295 --> 02:40:29.476
MATT: That's everyone, yeah.

02:40:29.476 --> 02:40:30.871
MARISHA: Bitches gonna die!

02:40:30.871 --> 02:40:35.485
MATT: All righty! First, surprise round from all
of you guys, catching them off-guard.

02:40:35.485 --> 02:40:37.453
Up first is Percy.

02:40:37.453 --> 02:40:38.703
MARISHA: Percy!

02:40:38.703 --> 02:40:44.448
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull into that empty-- Oh,
I've got a button, don't I? I'm going to pull into

02:40:44.448 --> 02:40:45.713
that corner right there?

02:40:45.713 --> 02:40:46.987
MATT: Over here?

02:40:46.987 --> 02:40:52.908
TALIESIN: And I'm going to take two shots at that
soldier in the corner, that guard.

02:40:52.963 --> 02:41:03.244
MATT: Okay. The guards, you can see, are wearing
dark studded leather armor, no cloaks. Both have

02:41:03.244 --> 02:41:10.959
rapiers or stilettos, daggers on their sides. They
look at the sudden intrusion and begin going for

02:41:10.959 --> 02:41:13.337
their weapons. You caught them off guard.

02:41:13.337 --> 02:41:14.412
TALIESIN: 22.

02:41:14.412 --> 02:41:15.875
MATT: 22 does hit.

02:41:15.875 --> 02:41:28.406
TALIESIN: That's just a d10, where are my d10s?
That's nine points of damage.

02:41:28.406 --> 02:41:29.438
MATT: All righty.

02:41:29.438 --> 02:41:31.479
TALIESIN: Another shot to him.

02:41:31.479 --> 02:41:32.984
MATT: All righty.

02:41:32.984 --> 02:41:47.066
TALIESIN: That's a misfire. I'm going to do a
quick repair. And that's fine.

02:41:47.066 --> 02:41:48.778
MATT: Does the repair take an action?

02:41:48.778 --> 02:41:50.142
TALIESIN: No, it takes a--

02:41:50.142 --> 02:41:57.613
MATT: Okay, so you're fine. It does not break.
Cool. That's your turn. One shot off. The blast

02:41:57.613 --> 02:42:04.886
rings out. As you fire the pepperbox, it misfires,
and you quickly throw one of your tools in the

02:42:04.886 --> 02:42:10.617
air, catch it, and with one swift movement you
unblock the passageway, click it back up into its

02:42:10.617 --> 02:42:18.571
place. Out of the corner of your eye, you turn,
and for the first time in five years, you see,

02:42:18.571 --> 02:42:22.959
standing behind the desk, Sir Kerrion Stonefell.
Visually, nearly the same as the last day you saw,

02:42:22.959 --> 02:42:30.052
except maybe a bit of white on the sides of
the hair. Armored with a nice set of relatively

02:42:30.052 --> 02:42:38.249
ornate leather armor, blue hues and blacks. The
hair itself is this tousled brown. There's a

02:42:38.249 --> 02:42:45.306
boyish charisma to him, if he wasn't such an
asshole. And the moment you see him, there's this

02:42:45.306 --> 02:42:49.688
boiling rage from within just to have that moment
of sight.

02:42:49.688 --> 02:42:51.888
TALIESIN: If you're lucky, you die last.

02:42:51.888 --> 02:42:58.912
MATT: There's a look of complete confusion, as he
has no idea who any of you are. You look like

02:42:58.980 --> 02:43:04.291
paupers that literally burst into his office. That
ends your turn, Percy. Grog, you're up.

02:43:04.321 --> 02:43:08.607
TRAVIS: I hear him say that he has to die last,
and in my rage, I race forward to that fuck in the

02:43:08.607 --> 02:43:12.707
middle of the room and I swing my Firebrand
Warhammer at him twice!

02:43:12.707 --> 02:43:14.469
MATT: All righty!

02:43:14.469 --> 02:43:20.752
TRAVIS: I would make to make this first one a new
feat called Great Weapon Master.

02:43:20.752 --> 02:43:23.073
MATT: All righty!

02:43:23.073 --> 02:43:24.197
SAM: What does that do?

02:43:24.197 --> 02:43:25.346
MATT: Minus five to hit.

02:43:25.346 --> 02:43:29.024
TRAVIS: I'm going to use my-- no, not on that one.
That misses.

02:43:29.024 --> 02:43:30.836
MATT: What did you roll?

02:43:30.836 --> 02:43:37.223
TRAVIS: A two! So that's 11. Yeah, that misses.

02:43:37.223 --> 02:43:42.157
MATT: That definitely misses. As you swing in,
(nervous yell) just ducks out of the way, and even

02:43:42.157 --> 02:43:46.756
though he's older, he reacted pretty quickly. Your
weapon slams into the ground, splintering some of

02:43:46.756 --> 02:43:48.941
the wood. You peel back for a second attack.

02:43:48.941 --> 02:43:59.317
TRAVIS: That makes me even angrier. And now I'll
use inspiration. 18... minus five, 23!

02:43:59.317 --> 02:44:01.839
MATT: 23 does hit! Plus ten damage.

02:44:01.839 --> 02:44:10.531
TRAVIS: Okay. Plus eight is 13, 17, 27!

02:44:10.531 --> 02:44:13.384
MATT: 27 points of damage, ooh!

02:44:13.384 --> 02:44:19.816
TRAVIS: Plus four for the fire damage, but still
the 27 total.

02:44:19.816 --> 02:44:25.923
MATT: So, as he ducks out of the way, you bring up
the hammer a second time and (whack) smack him

02:44:25.923 --> 02:44:30.661
right square in the chest. (grunts) The wind
escapes him for a moment and the flames lick

02:44:30.785 --> 02:44:35.513
across the front of his chest. He catches himself
on the table between the sofa and chair behind

02:44:35.513 --> 02:44:41.227
him. Gets back on his feet. Looks to you for a
second and pulls out two short swords.

02:44:41.227 --> 02:44:45.683
TRAVIS: That's the best thing you could have ever
done.

02:44:45.838 --> 02:44:49.185
MATT: "I don't know who you are, but you're going
to regret this!"

02:44:49.185 --> 02:44:51.800
LAURA: What does Grog look like?

02:44:51.800 --> 02:44:58.508
MATT: Grog looks like an oafish butcher. Tubby on
the sides, an oldish, middle-aged looking man.

02:44:58.508 --> 02:45:04.570
Scruffy beard. Scanlan does his best on that one.
Whatever other visual you want to--

02:45:04.570 --> 02:45:05.585
SAM: Potbelly.

02:45:05.585 --> 02:45:08.531
MATT: Huge potbelly. Grog, that ends your turn?

02:45:08.531 --> 02:45:09.439
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:45:09.439 --> 02:45:18.333
MATT: All right. In theory, it is a surprise
round. So you may have had advantage on that

02:45:18.404 --> 02:45:20.434
first strike, so go ahead and roll it.

02:45:20.434 --> 02:45:27.668
TRAVIS: (screams) 26. Minus five is 21.

02:45:27.668 --> 02:45:29.871
LAURA: 23. No, you're right.

02:45:29.871 --> 02:45:31.162
TRAVIS: Yeah. 21.

02:45:31.162 --> 02:45:35.762
MATT: Roll damage again. We'll say this is an
additional third strike in reaction to him pulling

02:45:35.762 --> 02:45:40.458
his blades out.

02:45:40.525 --> 02:45:42.597
TRAVIS: 32.

02:45:42.597 --> 02:45:44.460
SAM: Jesus! God!

02:45:44.460 --> 02:45:50.338
MATT: (wham) The hammer slams him a second time
and he almost drops his weapons. The actual end

02:45:50.410 --> 02:45:55.384
table he's resting on shatters beneath him and he,
(grunts) has to get back up onto his feet. Looking

02:45:55.384 --> 02:45:58.332
genuinely fearful now. That ends your turn.

02:45:58.332 --> 02:45:59.751
TRAVIS: You dropped your toothpicks.

02:45:59.751 --> 02:46:00.983
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

02:46:00.983 --> 02:46:03.305
SAM: Okay, so he's been attacking the old guy.

02:46:03.305 --> 02:46:04.211
MATT: Correct.

02:46:04.211 --> 02:46:08.556
SAM: Those two flanking the big boss are just
guards, right?

02:46:08.556 --> 02:46:10.925
They're just standard-issue guards?

02:46:10.925 --> 02:46:16.300
MATT: Best you can tell, they're both in studded
leather armor. They don't look like guards, like

02:46:16.300 --> 02:46:19.231
armored, they look like thugs that are essentially
there to watch.

02:46:19.231 --> 02:46:21.941
SAM: All right, well, I'm going to run in the
room.

02:46:21.941 --> 02:46:24.291
MATT: About how far in?

02:46:24.291 --> 02:46:31.473
SAM: Make a left. I'm sorry, turn right, away from
the action. And then I'll look at the guard

02:46:31.473 --> 02:46:35.534
behind and to the right of the big guy.

02:46:35.578 --> 02:46:36.702
MATT: That guy there.

02:46:36.702 --> 02:46:38.363
SAM: The good guy-- the bad guy.

02:46:38.363 --> 02:46:40.415
MARISHA: You got it.

02:46:40.415 --> 02:46:42.442
MATT: That guy there?

02:46:42.442 --> 02:46:45.194
SAM: No, this guy over here. And I'll Dominate
him.

02:46:45.194 --> 02:46:48.745
MARISHA: Is that also a guard? There are three
guards?

02:46:48.826 --> 02:46:50.221
TALIESIN: There are three guards.

02:46:50.221 --> 02:46:51.823
MATT: All right, you're going to attempt to
Dominate Person.

02:46:51.823 --> 02:46:57.486
SAM: Yes. I pull up my hand cone and I say,
(singing) You're as cold as ice! Willing to

02:46:57.486 --> 02:47:02.432
sacrifice your boss! And so I tell him to kill his
boss.

02:47:02.432 --> 02:47:04.513
(laughter)

02:47:04.513 --> 02:47:05.996
MATT: What's the DC on that?

02:47:05.996 --> 02:47:07.025
SAM: 19.

02:47:07.025 --> 02:47:08.732
MATT: Wisdom. He rolled a 17. That's a fail.

02:47:08.732 --> 02:47:09.797
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:47:09.797 --> 02:47:13.177
MATT: He is currently Dominated by Scanlan.

02:47:13.177 --> 02:47:14.483
TRAVIS: (singing) Cold as ice!

02:47:14.483 --> 02:47:22.961
MATT: Good to know. So, as he pulls his heavy
crossbow out, loads it, and aims it towards you,

02:47:22.961 --> 02:47:29.553
looks over his shoulder for a second, and trains
it on his boss. Sir Kerrion looking confused by

02:47:29.553 --> 02:47:30.963
this whole circumstance.

02:47:30.963 --> 02:47:32.078
MARISHA: Cool.

02:47:32.078 --> 02:47:33.681
MATT: That ends your turn?

02:47:33.681 --> 02:47:34.757
SAM: Yeah, that's it.

02:47:34.757 --> 02:47:39.163
MATT: All right. Keyleth, Vax, and Vex, take your
surprise rounds now.

02:47:39.163 --> 02:47:43.443
LAURA: Can I go first so I don't do any damage to
you guys if you guys go in?

02:47:43.443 --> 02:47:45.353
MARISHA: I'm also probably going to do a ranged
spell.

02:47:45.353 --> 02:47:48.605
LIAM: What are you guys talking about? Kill him!

02:47:48.605 --> 02:47:55.362
LAURA: I want to go in, peek my head in and
shoot-- first, I'm going to shoot from my Longbow

02:47:55.362 --> 02:48:02.961
of Sky Sentinel. And I'm going to use-- it turns
into three arrows for one of my attacks, so it's

02:48:02.961 --> 02:48:05.154
three more attacks, potentially?

02:48:05.154 --> 02:48:09.582
MATT: Well, it's two additional attacks against
the one arrow. So you'd get four attacks in one

02:48:09.582 --> 02:48:11.113
round, essentially.

02:48:11.113 --> 02:48:12.004
SAM: Good god!

02:48:12.004 --> 02:48:17.532
LAURA: Okay! I'm going to do that! I'm going to
attack him, the guy.

02:48:17.532 --> 02:48:18.764
MATT: Which guy?

02:48:18.764 --> 02:48:20.026
LAURA: The bad guy.

02:48:20.026 --> 02:48:21.719
MATT: There's two bad guys in there.

02:48:21.719 --> 02:48:23.873
LAURA: The one that's in charge. Kerrion.

02:48:23.873 --> 02:48:25.156
MATT: Sir Kerrion? All right, go for it.

02:48:25.156 --> 02:48:28.322
LAURA: Yeah! 28.

02:48:28.322 --> 02:48:29.315
MATT: 28 hits.

02:48:29.315 --> 02:48:32.827
LAURA: Okay, so I make an attack for all three
arrows.

02:48:32.827 --> 02:48:38.443
MATT: Correct. That was one of them. You fire it,
it splits into three along the way, and you roll

02:48:38.443 --> 02:48:39.856
for each attack on each arrow.

02:48:39.856 --> 02:48:44.828
LAURA: Oh, that one doesn't hit. Well, probably
not. 13?

02:48:44.828 --> 02:48:45.905
MATT: No.

02:48:45.905 --> 02:48:48.841
LAURA: 18?

02:48:48.841 --> 02:48:51.199
MATT: 18 unfortunately does not hit, either.

02:48:51.250 --> 02:48:53.972
LAURA: Jeez Louise, what a waste of a storm
arrow.

02:48:53.972 --> 02:48:57.215
MATT: And you still get a fourth attack with your
second--

02:48:57.215 --> 02:48:58.183
LAURA: Yes.

02:48:58.183 --> 02:49:00.290
TALIESIN: Hunter's Mark?

02:49:00.290 --> 02:49:06.915
LAURA: That was the wrong thing. I can't; I'm
going to Hunter's Mark him after this first one

02:49:06.915 --> 02:49:08.853
because it's a bonus action.

02:49:08.853 --> 02:49:10.204
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

02:49:10.204 --> 02:49:20.596
LAURA: What am I doing? 14, 15, 16, and then plus
another d6, so it's

02:49:20.596 --> 02:49:24.010
basically like Hunter's Mark, right?

02:49:24.010 --> 02:49:26.337
TRAVIS: Nobody knows what you're doing.

02:49:26.337 --> 02:49:34.552
(laughter)

02:49:34.641 --> 02:49:36.417
MATT: So the first arrow does an additional
lightning damage.

02:49:36.486 --> 02:49:43.720
LAURA: 19 is the first one. And then I attack
again. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him now. Can I

02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:44.834
do that?

02:49:44.834 --> 02:49:51.305
MATT: You haven't used your bonus action, so yes
you can. Two eyes going all--

02:49:51.305 --> 02:49:52.812
LAURA: 29.

02:49:52.812 --> 02:49:54.364
MATT: 29 does hit, yes.

02:49:54.364 --> 02:49:57.164
LAURA: I'm so confused right now.

02:49:57.164 --> 02:49:58.455
LIAM: Us, too.

02:49:58.455 --> 02:50:02.416
LAURA: I know. 14 on the second one.

02:50:02.416 --> 02:50:09.691
MATT: Okay, gotcha. So your arrows split, two of
them embedding into the actual desk itself and

02:50:09.691 --> 02:50:14.193
exploding with a burst of electricity. A third one
strikes him in the chest and you can see it stick

02:50:14.193 --> 02:50:18.763
in the armor and (boof) jolt him for a second. He
backs up a little bit, catching himself on the

02:50:18.763 --> 02:50:22.353
edge of the desk as the final arrow comes and
strikes him in the shoulder. He cuts off the shaft

02:50:22.353 --> 02:50:25.952
of the arrow as it hits (grunts) out of anger and
frustration.

02:50:25.952 --> 02:50:31.600
LAURA: I totally shit the bed on that one, guys,
and I apologize. I had things I wanted to do.

02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:37.027
SAM: After she does that, I say: that was my
grandma!

02:50:37.027 --> 02:50:38.680
(laughter)

02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:40.073
LAURA: That's right, boy!

02:50:40.073 --> 02:50:41.067
MATT: This little boy.

02:50:41.067 --> 02:50:42.257
TRAVIS: Adding to the confusion.

02:50:42.257 --> 02:50:49.941
MATT: Do you want to move at all? You would've had
to move into the room to do that shot because you

02:50:49.941 --> 02:50:51.271
were outside in the hallway.

02:50:51.271 --> 02:50:52.222
LAURA: Huh?

02:50:52.222 --> 02:50:53.911
MATT: You were in the hallway when that happened,
so I'd say you'd have to be in the room to shoot

02:50:53.911 --> 02:50:55.143
them. Where would you want to be?

02:50:55.143 --> 02:50:56.505
LAURA: Oh, just right inside the door.

02:50:56.505 --> 02:50:57.610
MATT: Right there in the door?

02:50:57.610 --> 02:50:59.936
MARISHA: What kind of armor is Sir Kerrion
wearing?

02:50:59.936 --> 02:51:04.659
MATT: Best you can tell, it looks like a very high
quality studded leather.

02:51:04.659 --> 02:51:06.039
MARISHA: Studded leather?

02:51:06.039 --> 02:51:06.984
MATT: Yeah.

02:51:06.984 --> 02:51:07.888
MARISHA: Okay.

02:51:07.888 --> 02:51:12.363
LAURA: Can I say I peeked in to shoot and then
went back around the side of the door?

02:51:12.363 --> 02:51:14.806
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

02:51:14.806 --> 02:51:15.728
LAURA: Yeah.

02:51:15.728 --> 02:51:18.766
TRAVIS: Keyleth, Vax.

02:51:18.766 --> 02:51:20.171
LIAM: Is it up to us?

02:51:20.171 --> 02:51:22.268
MATT: You guys are the last ones to go.

02:51:22.268 --> 02:51:23.312
LIAM: Go.

02:51:23.312 --> 02:51:32.654
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to cast Call Lightning.
And I'm going to bring down a bolt. Here we go.

02:51:32.654 --> 02:51:40.243
This way. Right in between Sir Kerrion and this
guard so they both have to save from it.

02:51:40.243 --> 02:51:42.118
SAM: Take that, Sir Korea!

02:51:42.118 --> 02:51:43.681
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:51:43.681 --> 02:51:47.105
TALIESIN: Kerrion Stonefell.

02:51:47.105 --> 02:51:50.944
MATT: As a thing of note, a storm cloud appears in
the shape of a cylinder that is ten feet tall with

02:51:50.944 --> 02:51:55.907
a 60-foot radius centered on a point you can see
in the air.

02:51:55.907 --> 02:51:57.399
MARISHA: Oh, so it's going to--

02:51:57.399 --> 02:51:59.213
MATT: The room won't fit it, unfortunately.

02:51:59.213 --> 02:52:00.889
MARISHA: The room won't fit my storm cloud?

02:52:00.889 --> 02:52:04.317
TALIESIN: That sounds like a great song.

02:52:04.317 --> 02:52:09.092
MATT: It says if you're in a room that can't
accommodate the cloud, it can't appear.

02:52:09.092 --> 02:52:12.839
MARISHA: Pooper muffin. Okay. Well, then.

02:52:12.839 --> 02:52:14.903
MATT: If you want to consider your next move, Vax
can go.

02:52:14.903 --> 02:52:16.051
MARISHA: Yeah, go Vax.

02:52:16.051 --> 02:52:23.471
LIAM: I am running straight towards
what's-his-name, Kerrion? Is at the desk, so I

02:52:23.471 --> 02:52:28.399
just run right towards the desk, I step against
the desk, leap up in the air and go

02:52:28.399 --> 02:52:30.697
(stabbing sound) into his shoulders.

02:52:30.697 --> 02:52:31.746
MATT: Right there?

02:52:31.746 --> 02:52:36.161
LIAM: Yeah, no, I'm on the desk in front of him,
going for his chest.

02:52:36.161 --> 02:52:37.608
MATT: Go for it.

02:52:37.608 --> 02:52:47.941
LIAM: First, and I get advantage on everything is
a-- It's a 30! And this is surprise attack, so

02:52:47.941 --> 02:52:54.038
it's a critical hit plus the sneak attack damage.
This guy is going down! One plus seven is eight--

02:52:54.038 --> 02:52:55.620
what gets doubled?

02:52:55.620 --> 02:52:57.390
MATT: Just the dice.

02:52:57.390 --> 02:52:59.699
LIAM: Just the dice? But not the sneak attack
damage?

02:52:59.776 --> 02:53:03.010
MATT: No, the sneak attack damage, as well, but
just the modifiers don't get doubled.

02:53:03.010 --> 02:53:16.430
LIAM: Okay. So that was-- okay, two plus seven is
nine. Nine, ten, 11, 12, 18, 23, 29, 33, 66 for

02:53:16.430 --> 02:53:18.359
the first attack, darling.

02:53:18.359 --> 02:53:19.377
SAM: 66?!

02:53:19.377 --> 02:53:22.606
LIAM: 66! Here comes the second dagger into him at
advantage.

02:53:22.606 --> 02:53:24.053
MARISHA: 66?!

02:53:24.053 --> 02:53:25.478
MATT: Surprise rounds.

02:53:25.478 --> 02:53:35.356
LIAM: Is 28, so that obviously hits. And that is
seven. And then the third dagger comes down. Is

02:53:35.356 --> 02:53:42.919
29, and that also hits. So I've shanked his ass,
that's an eight. (stabbing noises)

02:53:42.919 --> 02:53:47.466
SAM: That's 15, is 70-- is 81.

02:53:47.466 --> 02:53:52.862
MATT: Yep. 81 points of damage in one round of
combat. As you land on the desk, your daggers

02:53:52.862 --> 02:53:58.158
bypass the armor and they find their way through
the top of the armor and sink past the clavicles

02:53:58.158 --> 02:54:03.223
into the deep portion of the chest. He (choking
noise) from the impact and you hear him choke and

02:54:03.223 --> 02:54:10.957
blood splatters up from his throat. He reaches up
and grabs your hands and lifts them off out of the

02:54:10.957 --> 02:54:15.801
wound. You see a gout of blood pour from the wound
as you reach back and stab him a third time with

02:54:15.801 --> 02:54:20.147
the dagger as you catch yourself on
the desk. He reaches up and kicks you, forcing you

02:54:20.223 --> 02:54:25.529
to get back on your feet with your daggers at
the ready. The blood's beginning to pour. It's not

02:54:25.529 --> 02:54:31.072
a mortal wound, but it's looking really bad for
him. He's not on death's door, but that definitely

02:54:31.072 --> 02:54:33.064
took him down a few pegs.

02:54:33.064 --> 02:54:35.543
LIAM: I give him a Vex wink.

02:54:35.543 --> 02:54:42.361
MATT: (laughs) He looks at you and growls. Draws
two rapiers from his side.

02:54:42.428 --> 02:54:43.488
TRAVIS: Two rapiers?

02:54:43.488 --> 02:54:44.744
MATT: Yeah.

02:54:44.744 --> 02:54:49.243
MARISHA: He draws two rapiers? Do we get any
indication by what we just saw if he might be a

02:54:49.243 --> 02:54:50.677
vampire or something?

02:54:50.677 --> 02:54:53.670
MATT: Make an insight check.

02:54:53.670 --> 02:55:01.377
MARISHA: I can make an insight check? Ooh, yeah!
27.

02:55:01.377 --> 02:55:05.797
MATT: 27. Nothing yet has given away any sort of
essence of that.

02:55:05.797 --> 02:55:07.674
He doesn't look particularly pale.

02:55:07.674 --> 02:55:11.075
TALIESIN: He's also aged. He's a bit peppered.

02:55:11.143 --> 02:55:13.174
MARISHA: Yeah, he has aged.

02:55:13.174 --> 02:55:16.514
MATT: He definitely looks wounded and unhappy.

02:55:16.514 --> 02:55:18.139
LIAM: Can I ask a technical question?

02:55:18.139 --> 02:55:19.135
MATT: Sure.

02:55:19.135 --> 02:55:23.981
LIAM: According to Assassinate, any hit I score
against a creature that is surprised is a critical

02:55:23.981 --> 02:55:27.041
hit. Any hit. So are the two subsequent attacks--

02:55:27.041 --> 02:55:28.368
MATT: After the first hit--

02:55:28.368 --> 02:55:33.755
LIAM: That's sneak attack. This says, "in
addition, any hit you score against a creature

02:55:33.755 --> 02:55:36.073
"that is surprised is a critical hit."

02:55:36.073 --> 02:55:39.524
MATT: Right. Okay.

02:55:39.524 --> 02:55:42.880
SAM: Any? He wouldn't be surprised after the first
one.

02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:46.322
MATT: I'm usually under the impression that after
the first hit, they're no longer surprised. They

02:55:46.322 --> 02:55:47.331
know you're there.

02:55:47.331 --> 02:55:49.501
LIAM: Okay. Okay. Got it.

02:55:49.501 --> 02:55:51.993
TRAVIS: (grunts) Ow! (grunts) Ow?!

02:55:51.993 --> 02:55:57.549
LIAM: Well, I thought they were like 0.3 seconds
apart, so I thought it was so fast.

02:55:57.549 --> 02:55:58.836
MATT: That's true. I'll allow it.

02:55:58.836 --> 02:55:59.889
TRAVIS: Oh!

02:55:59.889 --> 02:56:01.157
TALIESIN: What?!

02:56:01.157 --> 02:56:02.266
TRAVIS: Double what?

02:56:02.266 --> 02:56:06.307
LIAM: Double the last two attacks. Which were much
less.

02:56:06.307 --> 02:56:08.122
SAM: It was 15, so it becomes 30.

02:56:08.122 --> 02:56:18.246
MATT: Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, he's not happy. Really
not happy. Okay. All right. That ends your turn.

02:56:18.305 --> 02:56:20.301
Keyleth, what are you doing?

02:56:20.301 --> 02:56:29.361
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to do some fun shit.
So seeing Vax go up and get next to Lord Kerrion

02:56:29.361 --> 02:56:36.069
or whatever the shit his name is. I'm going to go
and turn into a dire wolf this time. Mixing it up

02:56:36.069 --> 02:56:37.345
from Minxie.

02:56:37.345 --> 02:56:38.525
TALIESIN: That's like a normal wolf.

02:56:38.525 --> 02:56:39.704
MARISHA: But slightly bigger.

02:56:39.704 --> 02:56:40.547
TALIESIN: But dire.

02:56:40.547 --> 02:56:44.587
MARISHA: But dire. It's white, a wintery wolf from
the mountains that I'm from.

02:56:44.587 --> 02:56:50.487
MATT: You are now filling up the entirety of the
double-door frame right now.

02:56:50.487 --> 02:57:00.310
MARISHA: I'm going to rush and use my pack tactics
and flank Lord Kerrion.

02:57:00.310 --> 02:57:08.117
MATT: At your size, you can't quite get to him,
unfortunately. You can try and move around this

02:57:08.117 --> 02:57:12.716
way, maybe. You will probably take an attack of
opportunity from this guy, but you can try and

02:57:12.716 --> 02:57:13.668
move around.

02:57:13.668 --> 02:57:15.611
MARISHA: Oh, from a random shithead? Yeah, let's
do it.

02:57:15.611 --> 02:57:16.684
MATT: What's your movement?

02:57:16.684 --> 02:57:18.843
MARISHA: 50 feet.

02:57:18.843 --> 02:57:23.596
MATT: Yeah, you can do that. You move around and
you get over there.

02:57:23.596 --> 02:57:25.264
MARISHA: Is that flanking?

02:57:25.264 --> 02:57:37.842
MATT: It's not flanking, no. Yeah, it's not
flanking per se. I mean, you're adjacent to him.

02:57:37.842 --> 02:57:40.255
You'd have to be on opposite sides to flank.

02:57:40.255 --> 02:57:45.401
MARISHA: I know, that's what I was trying to get.
All right. Well, then, since Vax has that guy,

02:57:45.401 --> 02:57:47.778
I'll go for this guy. Take him out.

02:57:47.778 --> 02:57:50.346
MATT: Okay. So you move into that guy there.

02:57:50.346 --> 02:57:52.379
MARISHA: Okay.

02:57:52.379 --> 02:57:56.387
SAM: That is the most peasant-looking direwolf
ever.

02:57:56.387 --> 02:57:59.549
MATT: Yeah, this little peasant girl just went
(growls).

02:57:59.549 --> 02:58:02.368
MARISHA: Ooh, that was a 19 to hit.

02:58:02.368 --> 02:58:04.266
MATT: That'll hit.

02:58:04.266 --> 02:58:15.058
MARISHA: Okay, 2d6 plus three. That's not great,
four, five, six, seven, eight piercing damage, and

02:58:15.058 --> 02:58:22.242
then do I also-- oh, and he has to make a DC 13
strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

02:58:22.242 --> 02:58:24.652
MATT: He rolled a 12.

02:58:24.652 --> 02:58:26.991
MARISHA: (cheers) So he's down.

02:58:26.991 --> 02:58:28.652
MATT: He's knocked prone. How much damage was it?

02:58:28.652 --> 02:58:30.788
MARISHA: Not a lot. What did I say, six?

02:58:30.788 --> 02:58:32.391
MATT: Six points of piercing damage?

02:58:32.391 --> 02:58:33.269
MARISHA: Yes.

02:58:33.269 --> 02:58:36.787
MATT: He's knocked prone. (impact sound) Falls on
the ground.

02:58:36.787 --> 02:58:40.343
MARISHA: Do I get my fiery stuff for that?

02:58:40.343 --> 02:58:42.371
MATT: What attack was it? Was it bite?

02:58:42.371 --> 02:58:43.167
MARISHA: Bite.

02:58:43.167 --> 02:58:43.972
MATT: No.

02:58:43.972 --> 02:58:45.467
MARISHA: Okay. Okay, he's down.

02:58:45.467 --> 02:58:46.494
MATT: All right. Is that your turn?

02:58:46.494 --> 02:58:47.364
MARISHA: Yep.

02:58:47.364 --> 02:58:52.496
MATT: All right. That ends the surprise round. Now
we're at the top again. Percy, you're up.

02:58:52.496 --> 02:59:00.833
TALIESIN: I'm going to take one step forward. I'm
going to shoot that guard once, one more time.

02:59:00.833 --> 02:59:01.949
MATT: The one over here?

02:59:01.949 --> 02:59:02.681
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:59:02.681 --> 02:59:03.604
MATT: All righty.

02:59:03.604 --> 02:59:11.682
TALIESIN: Fuck it, I'm going to try sharpshooter.
And that's 14, 15, 21 to hit?

02:59:11.682 --> 02:59:12.736
MATT: 21 hits.

02:59:12.736 --> 02:59:23.260
TALIESIN: That'll do 19 points of damage.
Actually, that's more than 19 points, because it's

02:59:23.260 --> 02:59:28.187
a fire shot, so 19 plus two, so 21 points, with
two points of fire damage in there.

02:59:28.187 --> 02:59:31.590
MATT: 21 points of damage. All right, (gunshot
sound) you fire. There's a burst of flame that

02:59:31.590 --> 02:59:35.324
gouts out the side of the pepperbox, (impact sound)
blasting into the chest of the guard off to the

02:59:35.324 --> 02:59:38.532
side. He's thrown against the wall from the sheer
force of it. Reaches down and grabs his chest and

02:59:38.532 --> 02:59:41.632
looks at it, and you can see there's this red
crimson across his hand, as you've actually blown

02:59:41.632 --> 02:59:46.011
a piece of his leather armor open and you can see
the wound in his chest. There's a little bit of

02:59:46.011 --> 02:59:49.300
blood trickling out of his mouth, and he
looks angry at you.

02:59:49.300 --> 02:59:51.611
TALIESIN: I'm shooting him again.

02:59:51.661 --> 02:59:53.493
(laughter)

02:59:53.493 --> 02:59:55.111
TALIESIN: That's 17.

02:59:55.111 --> 02:59:56.333
MATT: 17 hits.

02:59:56.333 --> 02:59:57.478
MARISHA: Nice.

02:59:57.478 --> 03:00:01.173
TALIESIN: That's 21 points of damage.

03:00:01.173 --> 03:00:06.303
MATT: 21 points of damage, nice. (gunshot) You
blast him, this time on the other side of the

03:00:06.303 --> 03:00:09.981
shoulder, you can see now this armor is now torn
open exposing the wound here and his arm's now

03:00:09.981 --> 03:00:13.697
hanging to one side. He's (grunts). He's looking
in severe pain and

03:00:13.697 --> 03:00:15.813
barely hanging on at this point.

03:00:15.813 --> 03:00:18.706
TALIESIN: Fall, damn it. Shooting him again.

03:00:18.706 --> 03:00:19.772
MARISHA: Kill him!

03:00:19.772 --> 03:00:29.540
TALIESIN: That's 20 to hit.

03:00:29.540 --> 03:00:31.487
MATT: 20 to hit. It hits.

03:00:31.487 --> 03:00:34.501
TALIESIN: Eight points of damage.

03:00:34.501 --> 03:00:40.025
MATT: Eight points of damage. All right, this is
the final one as he's looking at himself; he's

03:00:40.025 --> 03:00:42.773
like (pained noises), angrily looks at you, picks
his crossbow up and aims it at you. Before he gets

03:00:42.773 --> 03:00:46.160
a chance to, you aim your third shot, (gunshot)
firing, hitting him right in the center of the

03:00:46.213 --> 03:00:51.246
head, (impact noise) blasting out part of his
face, his body spins, and then he falls over into

03:00:51.246 --> 03:00:53.706
the plant in the corner, slumped over it there.

03:00:53.706 --> 03:00:59.645
TALIESIN: I finish walking almost into the corner
over there, right next to him, about there. Spend

03:00:59.645 --> 03:01:03.286
an action surge, taking three more shots at
Kerrion.

03:01:03.286 --> 03:01:04.152
SAM: Whoa.

03:01:04.152 --> 03:01:05.276
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:01:05.276 --> 03:01:06.212
SAM: Damn.

03:01:06.212 --> 03:01:09.298
TALIESIN: This is a sharpshooter round.

03:01:09.298 --> 03:01:10.372
MATT: Okay.

03:01:10.372 --> 03:01:14.664
TALIESIN: That's 19, 26 to hit.

03:01:14.664 --> 03:01:15.738
MATT: 26 hits.

03:01:15.738 --> 03:01:16.827
MARISHA: Do you crit on a 19?

03:01:16.827 --> 03:01:17.953
TALIESIN: I don't crit on a 19.

03:01:17.953 --> 03:01:18.938
MARISHA: Fuck!

03:01:18.938 --> 03:01:27.485
TALIESIN: Oh, that'll do. 24 points of damage plus
a point of ice damage. So, 25 points of damage.

03:01:27.485 --> 03:01:30.314
MATT: Plus an additional d6 points of damage for
that.

03:01:30.314 --> 03:01:34.747
TALIESIN: Yay! Because he's an asshole. That's six
more points of damage.

03:01:34.747 --> 03:01:41.340
MATT: So, as you go around and fire from the
barrel, the shot fires out. And as you recoil you

03:01:41.340 --> 03:01:46.772
guys, for those who are noticing off to the side,
this dark smoke's beginning to slowly pour out of

03:01:46.772 --> 03:01:53.300
Percy's body, out of his eyes and his ears and the
hand on the gun. There's black smoke beginning to

03:01:53.300 --> 03:01:56.198
emit from his body and beginning to envelop the
gun arm.

03:01:56.198 --> 03:01:58.869
SAM: What?

03:01:58.933 --> 03:02:00.778
MARISHA: We all see this?

03:02:00.778 --> 03:02:03.573
MATT: For those who are paying attention, which
right now would be pretty much just

03:02:03.573 --> 03:02:05.768
Scanlan and Vex.

03:02:05.768 --> 03:02:07.751
SAM: You're weird.

03:02:07.751 --> 03:02:11.404
TALIESIN: So you don't see shit. Shut up.

03:02:11.404 --> 03:02:13.693
MARISHA: I'm not crazy! No, and I'm at this guy's
throat.

03:02:13.693 --> 03:02:19.208
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a quick reload, and
I'm going to fire again, with Sharpshooter, and

03:02:19.208 --> 03:02:22.638
I'm going to do a head shot.

03:02:22.638 --> 03:02:24.411
MATT: Okay.

03:02:24.411 --> 03:02:32.793
TALIESIN: So, I'm going to attempt to make him
have issues doing things.

03:02:32.793 --> 03:02:34.237
Natural 20.

03:02:34.237 --> 03:02:36.145
(cheering)

03:02:36.145 --> 03:02:38.119
TRAVIS: The golden snitch strikes again!

03:02:38.119 --> 03:02:40.505
MARISHA: Yeah, it did! I can see it from here!

03:02:40.505 --> 03:02:43.106
MATT: Damn!

03:02:43.106 --> 03:02:44.301
TALIESIN: I swear it's-- yeah.

03:02:44.301 --> 03:02:45.475
MATT: With the additional d6, by the way.

03:02:45.475 --> 03:02:46.304
TALIESIN: What?

03:02:46.304 --> 03:02:47.369
MATT: With the additional d6.

03:02:47.369 --> 03:02:48.752
TALIESIN: Does the d6 double or does it not
double?

03:02:48.752 --> 03:02:52.141
MATT: All dice rolled double. Then add the
modifier.

03:02:52.141 --> 03:02:53.522
TALIESIN: This is going to be angry.

03:02:53.522 --> 03:02:54.332
MARISHA: Yeah it is!

03:02:54.332 --> 03:02:55.586
LIAM: Gunslinger warlock.

03:02:55.586 --> 03:02:58.430
TALIESIN: So.

03:02:58.430 --> 03:03:04.530
MARISHA: That's pretty "grood."

03:03:04.530 --> 03:03:17.780
TALIESIN: 42 points of damage. Of fire damage. 42
points, and that's with 5 points of fire damage.

03:03:17.780 --> 03:03:18.813
42 points.

03:03:18.813 --> 03:03:25.160
MATT: Okay. (gunshot) The first blast hits and you
can see the cloak is blown off the shoulder and

03:03:25.160 --> 03:03:29.275
set aflame and actually burns to cinders in the
corner. Sir Kerrion looks down and is like

03:03:29.275 --> 03:03:39.870
(grunts), and is looking very, very curiously. The
second shot rings out (gunshot), and at this point

03:03:39.870 --> 03:03:45.165
now the smoke is wreathing your entire arm, the
gun isn't even visible, it's just this giant column

03:03:45.165 --> 03:03:51.920
of smoke. (gunshot) The second shot rings out, this
time hitting him in the side of the neck and the

03:03:51.962 --> 03:03:56.647
shoulder, blowing a chunk off of it so part of the
bone is now sticking out it's like (noise of

03:03:56.693 --> 03:04:00.194
pain). He reaches back with his arm and is like
with the rapier up, clutching it for a second and

03:04:00.194 --> 03:04:04.952
leans over and looks back over and is (pained
panting) "Ripley."

03:04:04.952 --> 03:04:13.531
TALIESIN: Just as an action, as a bonus action,
I'm going to remove my hat, and I'm just going to

03:04:13.531 --> 03:04:16.434
say: Drop it.

03:04:16.434 --> 03:04:19.813
SAM: Will this take an action?

03:04:19.813 --> 03:04:23.592
MATT: To drop the spell? You can do it on your
turn.

03:04:23.592 --> 03:04:24.738
TALIESIN: On your turn, yeah.

03:04:24.738 --> 03:04:26.464
SAM: Okay. I think that's next.

03:04:26.464 --> 03:04:29.070
MATT: All right, so.

03:04:29.070 --> 03:04:38.759
MARISHA: He thinks it's Ripley. He thinks it's
Ripley with the gun! Ripley's building guns!

03:04:38.759 --> 03:04:40.705
LAURA: It's Ripley that's doing the guns!

03:04:40.705 --> 03:04:41.801
MARISHA: Fucking Ripley!

03:04:41.801 --> 03:04:49.337
MATT: So. That finishes Percy's turn. It is now
Sir Kerrion Stonefell's turn. Kerrion's going to

03:04:49.337 --> 03:04:51.466
use a bonus action to use Second Wind.

03:04:51.466 --> 03:04:55.189
SAM: Oh no, that's some sort of healing thing
isn't it?

03:04:55.189 --> 03:04:57.617
TALIESIN: That's healing. It's not much healing.

03:04:57.617 --> 03:04:58.856
MARISHA: Wait, who's doing what?

03:04:58.856 --> 03:05:00.468
SAM: He has 6,000 health points.

03:05:00.468 --> 03:05:05.782
MARISHA: Kerrion's healing? Is it a regeneration
thing or is he casting a spell?

03:05:05.782 --> 03:05:07.981
TALIESIN: No, it's a fighter action.

03:05:07.981 --> 03:05:14.464
MATT: And that was with the head shot, you said?

03:05:14.464 --> 03:05:21.682
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was with a head shot. So that
means he has disadvantage on

03:05:21.682 --> 03:05:24.261
attacks for one round.

03:05:24.261 --> 03:05:25.469
MATT: And deals damage, right?

03:05:25.469 --> 03:05:26.641
TALIESIN: And deals damage.

03:05:26.641 --> 03:05:27.764
MATT: Okay.

03:05:27.764 --> 03:05:29.256
TALIESIN: I'm a good boy.

03:05:29.256 --> 03:05:37.044
MATT: Sir Kerrion is going to, in the
circumstance, is going to move this way just to

03:05:37.044 --> 03:05:43.027
hide alongside Vax, and since you're on top-- his
both rapiers out, and you just jammed your daggers

03:05:43.027 --> 03:05:45.952
in, is going to do a flurry of four strikes
against you.

03:05:45.952 --> 03:05:47.131
LIAM: Okay.

03:05:47.131 --> 03:05:48.952
MATT: With disadvantage on all the attacks.

03:05:48.952 --> 03:05:51.142
TRAVIS: His clavicles sticking out of his
shoulders.

03:05:51.142 --> 03:05:52.041
MATT: Yeah.

03:05:52.041 --> 03:05:57.278
LIAM: I'll use Uncanny Dodge for the first one
that hits.

03:05:57.278 --> 03:05:59.303
MATT: 16, the first attack?

03:05:59.303 --> 03:06:00.255
LIAM: No.

03:06:00.255 --> 03:06:13.352
MATT: All right. Rolled a one on the second. That
is a 21 on the third attack. And, no, that's a 14

03:06:13.352 --> 03:06:18.082
on the fourth attack. That disadvantage just--
swinging wide, gets one hit on you.

03:06:18.137 --> 03:06:19.978
TRAVIS: Get that clavicle; be working.

03:06:19.978 --> 03:06:22.924
LIAM: Yeah, Uncanny Dodge on that attack.

03:06:22.967 --> 03:06:25.778
MATT: That is eight points of piercing damage
against you.

03:06:25.778 --> 03:06:26.767
LIAM: So, four.

03:06:26.767 --> 03:06:28.902
SAM: Ooh! That's nothing!

03:06:28.902 --> 03:06:29.973
LIAM: That's nothing.

03:06:29.973 --> 03:06:32.735
MATT: That finishes Sir Kerrion. Sir Kerrion is
now going to--

03:06:32.735 --> 03:06:35.222
SAM: Turn invisible.

03:06:35.222 --> 03:06:40.887
MATT: He's actually going to take a step back
towards the wall. You get an attack of

03:06:40.887 --> 03:06:42.187
opportunity.

03:06:42.187 --> 03:06:43.877
LIAM: All right. I throw a dagger in his face.

03:06:43.877 --> 03:06:45.262
MATT: All right.

03:06:45.262 --> 03:06:49.145
LIAM: That is a 28.

03:06:49.145 --> 03:06:50.420
MATT: That hits.

03:06:50.420 --> 03:06:55.146
LIAM: That is eight points of damage.

03:06:55.146 --> 03:07:01.420
MATT: All righty. Steps back and slams his fist
against the wall (thudding).

03:07:01.420 --> 03:07:02.691
LAURA: Oh no!

03:07:02.691 --> 03:07:03.934
SAM: Wait, who did that?

03:07:03.934 --> 03:07:05.157
LAURA and TRAVIS: Kerrion.

03:07:05.157 --> 03:07:06.874
LAURA: He's calling in backup.

03:07:06.874 --> 03:07:10.418
MARISHA: Wait, he's calling in backup? Shit.

03:07:10.418 --> 03:07:11.616
LIAM: Yeah.

03:07:11.616 --> 03:07:14.818
MATT: So, that ends Kerrion's turn. Grog, you're
up.

03:07:14.818 --> 03:07:17.740
TRAVIS: I keep smashing shithead that's in front
of me!

03:07:17.740 --> 03:07:19.270
MATT: Okay, go for it!

03:07:19.270 --> 03:07:24.145
TRAVIS: That's 24. These are just regular.

03:07:24.145 --> 03:07:25.201
MATT: Yeah, 24 hits.

03:07:25.201 --> 03:07:30.285
TRAVIS: Oh, I should roll the other one first.
Again, 24.

03:07:30.285 --> 03:07:34.045
MATT: 24 hits. Are you going into a frenzied
rage?

03:07:34.045 --> 03:07:42.682
TRAVIS: Regular rage. 23 on the first one.

03:07:42.682 --> 03:07:43.968
MATT: All righty.

03:07:43.968 --> 03:07:48.200
TRAVIS: And 12 on the second.

03:07:48.200 --> 03:07:51.327
MATT: Gotcha. (whack) Is this with the fire damage
as well from the hammer?

03:07:51.327 --> 03:07:52.250
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:07:52.250 --> 03:07:56.405
MATT: Yeah. so the hammer strikes across the back,
the broadside of his shoulders and back. (grunts)

03:07:56.405 --> 03:08:02.642
Looks up at you and looks over at Sir Kerrion
being annihilated behind the desk and is trying to

03:08:02.642 --> 03:08:10.709
nervously gauge his circumstance. Second strike
smacks him upside his body and he's like (panting)

03:08:10.709 --> 03:08:16.415
and he's trying to take in the surroundings and
figure out a plan. All right, are you going to

03:08:16.415 --> 03:08:17.155
stay where you are?

03:08:17.155 --> 03:08:18.422
TRAVIS: That's it.

03:08:18.422 --> 03:08:23.631
MATT: It is now Master Vouk's turn.

03:08:23.631 --> 03:08:24.768
SAM: Who?

03:08:24.768 --> 03:08:28.083
MATT: You have not heard his name yet, but it's
his turn.

03:08:28.083 --> 03:08:29.785
TRAVIS: The guy I've been smacking.

03:08:29.785 --> 03:08:33.061
TALIESIN: Mr. Rogaine.

03:08:33.061 --> 03:08:38.336
LAURA: I'm picturing him as what's-his-name in--

03:08:38.336 --> 03:08:39.332
TALIESIN: From Harry Potter.

03:08:39.332 --> 03:08:40.070
LAURA: Yeah!

03:08:40.070 --> 03:08:41.276
TALIESIN: Yeah. I know, me too.

03:08:41.276 --> 03:08:42.097
TRAVIS: Mr. Filch?

03:08:42.097 --> 03:08:44.796
TALIESIN: Filch. Filch on steroids.

03:08:44.796 --> 03:08:45.999
LAURA: Yeah.

03:08:45.999 --> 03:08:59.649
MATT: He's going to use a-- okay. He's going to
use a bonus action to disengage from you. He's

03:08:59.649 --> 03:09:05.085
going to back away just one step that way. Use his
action to--

03:09:05.085 --> 03:09:06.766
LAURA: He has magic?!

03:09:06.766 --> 03:09:08.557
MARISHA: Oh, he's going to Dimension Door out.

03:09:08.557 --> 03:09:13.520
LAURA: But Mr. Filch doesn't have magic.

03:09:13.520 --> 03:09:14.847
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's a squib!

03:09:14.847 --> 03:09:17.864
LAURA: He's a squib! Squibs can't do magic.

03:09:17.864 --> 03:09:22.661
TRAVIS: He knows this. He's making origami.

03:09:22.661 --> 03:09:25.611
TALIESIN: Don't you get an attack of opportunity?

03:09:25.611 --> 03:09:29.988
MATT: Actually, instead, he's not going to use
bonus action to disengage, he's going to use a

03:09:29.988 --> 03:09:37.392
bonus action to use Misty Step. Vanishes,
reappears over by the wall. Uses the action to

03:09:37.392 --> 03:09:45.408
cast a level three Invisibility on both him and
Sir Kerrion Stonefell. So they are both

03:09:45.408 --> 03:09:48.347
considered invisible at the moment.

03:09:48.400 --> 03:09:51.577
TRAVIS: With the Missy Elliot step, I don't get an
attack?

03:09:51.577 --> 03:09:54.820
MATT: Not from that, unfortunately; it's an
immediate teleport. So he just vanishes from in

03:09:54.820 --> 03:09:55.962
front of you.

03:09:55.962 --> 03:09:57.866
TRAVIS: What the fuck?!

03:09:57.866 --> 03:10:01.594
MATT: We'll say, for the purposes of this, they
are both currently invisible.

03:10:01.594 --> 03:10:05.092
And that's going to end--

03:10:05.092 --> 03:10:09.454
TALIESIN: That soldier hasn't attacked yet,
either.

03:10:09.454 --> 03:10:15.004
MATT: Correct, his turn hasn't come up yet. Now it
becomes Scanlan's turn.

03:10:15.047 --> 03:10:23.997
SAM: Oh. Well, I can't see anyone who's alive who
I haven't Dominated already, except for the guy

03:10:23.997 --> 03:10:33.755
under the dire wolf. I will remind all my fellows
to keep one alive to spread our terrorist message

03:10:33.755 --> 03:10:43.790
and I will run out to the hallway and say, Vex, get
inside. Because I know reinforcements are coming,

03:10:43.790 --> 03:10:47.425
I cast Stinking Cloud out into the hallways.

03:10:47.425 --> 03:10:51.625
MATT: Okay. Stinking Cloud appears. What's the
radius on that?

03:10:51.625 --> 03:10:55.997
SAM: (singing) Stinking Cloud!

03:10:55.997 --> 03:10:58.094
MATT: I think it's a 20-foot radius, isn't it?

03:10:58.094 --> 03:11:02.179
SAM: It says 90-feet range, let's see here.
20-foot radius.

03:11:02.179 --> 03:11:06.163
MATT: Okay, cool. So you just filled this entire
hallway.

03:11:06.163 --> 03:11:09.100
SAM: Yeah. Will it seep into the room as well?

03:11:09.100 --> 03:11:12.534
MATT: You can keep it localized to that area,
you'll just be in your own cloud.

03:11:12.534 --> 03:11:14.585
SAM: Oh. Well, can I stop just short of the door?

03:11:14.585 --> 03:11:18.346
MATT: You stop just short of the door and fill
this whole area with a Stinking Cloud.

03:11:18.346 --> 03:11:19.538
SAM: Sorry, Vex.

03:11:19.538 --> 03:11:23.377
TALIESIN: You can hold that action until she comes
into the room.

03:11:23.377 --> 03:11:26.361
SAM: Okay, I will hold that until she comes in the
room.

03:11:26.361 --> 03:11:29.840
MATT: Okay. So Stinking Cloud is not yet up.
Okay.

03:11:29.840 --> 03:11:32.768
SAM: Laura's next, I believe.

03:11:32.768 --> 03:11:39.354
MATT: So, next round. You are up next.

03:11:39.354 --> 03:11:41.395
SAM: And I will inspire her, as well.

03:11:41.395 --> 03:11:42.352
LAURA: Yay!

03:11:42.352 --> 03:11:44.225
SAM: Do you want a d10?

03:11:44.225 --> 03:11:45.363
LAURA: Yeah.

03:11:45.363 --> 03:11:56.701
SAM: Okay. (singing) Vex be nimble, Vex be quick!
Vex jump under limbo stick! Now you don't know how

03:11:56.701 --> 03:12:00.359
you're going to react because Vex has an attack!
Oi!

03:12:00.359 --> 03:12:04.247
TRAVIS: Amazing! How?! God! I don't get it!

03:12:04.247 --> 03:12:12.078
MATT: You take your d10 inspiration. Confused, but
accept the inspiration. A chuckle in the middle of

03:12:12.078 --> 03:12:14.576
a hearty battle is always worth a little
inspiration.

03:12:14.576 --> 03:12:17.178
LAURA: All right, so I go in the room.

03:12:17.178 --> 03:12:22.768
MATT: You step into the room. At that point, you
trigger your action to release the Stinking Cloud.

03:12:22.768 --> 03:12:24.957
You want to stay there? You're just outside of the
radius.

03:12:24.957 --> 03:12:28.944
LAURA: Yeah, I stay in the doorway. Actually no, I
back-- well.

03:12:28.944 --> 03:12:31.723
MATT: What are you doing, Vex?

03:12:31.723 --> 03:12:37.780
LAURA: Yeah, I'm staying right there. I can't see;
is there a soldier right there next to the

03:12:37.780 --> 03:12:40.546
invisible guys, or is it just the invisible guys?

03:12:40.546 --> 03:12:44.136
TRAVIS: On that wall, it's soldier being eaten by
Keyleth, and then invisible.

03:12:44.136 --> 03:12:53.142
SAM: There two invisibles, and then another
soldier who I have already Dominated. He still

03:12:53.142 --> 03:12:54.675
hasn't had a turn?!

03:12:54.675 --> 03:12:58.864
MATT: Surprise round, and they're lowest on the
initiative count.

03:12:58.864 --> 03:13:03.492
LAURA: Actually, I'm going to do Lightning Arrow
because that gets everything within ten feet.

03:13:03.492 --> 03:13:04.793
MATT: Okay.

03:13:04.793 --> 03:13:07.225
LAURA: I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow on the
soldier on the ground.

03:13:07.225 --> 03:13:08.645
MATT: Which one?

03:13:08.645 --> 03:13:10.103
TRAVIS: The one that Keyleth's attacking.

03:13:10.103 --> 03:13:11.269
LAURA: The one that Keyleth's attacking.

03:13:11.269 --> 03:13:15.637
MATT: I will say you don't really have visual on
him from that position.

03:13:15.637 --> 03:13:17.004
LAURA: Can I move to a place where I get it?

03:13:17.004 --> 03:13:18.426
LIAM: Do a bank shot off the ceiling.

03:13:18.426 --> 03:13:20.273
MATT: Now you can see, yeah.

03:13:20.273 --> 03:13:21.563
LAURA: Awesome. Let's do it from there.

03:13:21.563 --> 03:13:24.540
MATT: Okay, go for it. You have advantage on the
attack roll because he is prone.

03:13:24.540 --> 03:13:29.460
LAURA: Nice. 27.

03:13:29.460 --> 03:13:30.642
MATT: 27 hits.

03:13:30.642 --> 03:13:33.577
LAURA: Okay, so that is 4d8 damage to him.

03:13:33.577 --> 03:13:34.668
MATT: All righty.

03:13:34.668 --> 03:13:38.992
LAURA: And then anything within ten feet has to
make a dex save.

03:13:38.992 --> 03:13:40.253
MATT: Okay.

03:13:40.253 --> 03:13:43.589
SAM: Is that including your brother?

03:13:43.589 --> 03:13:45.647
LAURA: Yeah, that's everything within ten feet.

03:13:45.647 --> 03:13:47.212
TRAVIS: It's also including invisible guys.

03:13:47.212 --> 03:13:50.313
MATT: If it's ten feet, he's not there. It'd just
be Keyleth and Sir Kerrion.

03:13:50.313 --> 03:13:58.189
MARISHA: 22. 21!

03:13:58.189 --> 03:14:02.565
MATT: Makes it, 21, actually, exactly.

03:14:02.565 --> 03:14:06.726
LAURA: 19 to little prone soldier.

03:14:06.726 --> 03:14:13.138
MATT: Okay, 19. As it snaps and it bursts, the
electricity shockwaves out, he shakes and on the

03:14:13.138 --> 03:14:18.161
ground takes in the effect. The blast seems to--
is it half damage if they make the save?

03:14:18.161 --> 03:14:21.222
LAURA: To the little prone guy?

03:14:21.222 --> 03:14:23.297
MATT: No, it's to anybody within radius.

03:14:23.297 --> 03:14:28.258
LAURA: Anybody within radius takes 1d8 if they
make the save and then 2d8 if they fail.

03:14:28.258 --> 03:14:29.523
MATT: Okay, so roll 1d8.

03:14:29.523 --> 03:14:32.130
LAURA: One.

03:14:32.130 --> 03:14:37.947
MATT: Okay. So one damage to you, and one damage
to Sir Kerrion.

03:14:37.947 --> 03:14:39.060
LAURA: Oh.

03:14:39.060 --> 03:14:43.206
MATT: You see a spark of energy around the
invisible form as it wavers in place.

03:14:43.206 --> 03:14:46.057
TRAVIS: That's good; at least he (electricity
noise) around some.

03:14:46.057 --> 03:14:48.541
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Vax?

03:14:48.541 --> 03:14:52.913
LIAM: I saw that spark in the air and I start 
knifing right into it.

03:14:52.977 --> 03:14:55.759
MATT: All right. Was that the last thing you
wanted to do with your turn?

03:14:55.759 --> 03:15:00.044
LAURA: Yeah. Does the Hunter's Mark damage him,
the invisible guy, still, if he gets hit with

03:15:00.044 --> 03:15:01.894
anything? Or is it just if I attack him with an
arrow?

03:15:01.894 --> 03:15:05.978
MATT: I think if you attack him. That was more of
the burst in the vicinity.

03:15:05.978 --> 03:15:07.415
LAURA: Okay.

03:15:07.415 --> 03:15:10.393
LIAM: So, hearing him go (grunts) and seeing a
spark right in front of me, I start knifing at

03:15:10.393 --> 03:15:11.710
that point.

03:15:11.710 --> 03:15:13.313
MATT: All right. At disadvantage on all the
attacks.

03:15:13.370 --> 03:15:16.327
LIAM: Disadvantage? But I get advantage, so it
cancels out.

03:15:16.327 --> 03:15:17.812
MATT: Why do you get advantage?

03:15:17.812 --> 03:15:20.437
LIAM: Oh, no, I don't. I'm sorry.

03:15:20.437 --> 03:15:22.752
MATT: Disadvantage on weapon strikes because he's
invisible.

03:15:22.752 --> 03:15:30.684
LIAM: The first one misses. That was it. So, the
first two were terrible. That's terrible. That's

03:15:30.684 --> 03:15:33.601
also terrible. I whiff. I just (whooshing).

03:15:33.601 --> 03:15:38.363
MATT: Yeah, you're swinging in the area, and you
can't get blades to find any of his physical

03:15:38.363 --> 03:15:42.949
person. You're striking and arcing across the
wooden wall behind him, causing these giant

03:15:42.949 --> 03:15:45.385
gashes. All right, that ends your turn.

03:15:45.385 --> 03:15:46.534
LIAM: Still bleeding!

03:15:46.534 --> 03:15:49.288
MATT: Unless you want to stay where you are right
there?

03:15:49.288 --> 03:15:51.889
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to stay there.

03:15:51.889 --> 03:15:54.297
MATT: You probably would've had to move up there
to attack him. Oh, you're just throwing the

03:15:54.297 --> 03:15:55.357
daggers, right?

03:15:55.357 --> 03:15:58.510
LIAM: I back up. Is Keyleth on the desk?

03:15:58.510 --> 03:16:00.072
SAM: No, she's next to the desk.

03:16:00.072 --> 03:16:03.283
LIAM: And I'm on the desk? No, I'll stay where I
am.

03:16:03.283 --> 03:16:05.722
MATT: Okay, so you're just throwing the daggers
from the desk? Okay, that ends your turn.

03:16:05.722 --> 03:16:08.785
Now, Keyleth.

03:16:08.785 --> 03:16:17.937
MARISHA: Looking up and noticing that Sir Kerrion
is gone and Vax is blindly stabbing into the

03:16:17.937 --> 03:16:24.690
distance, I'm going to drop my wolf form and cast
Faerie Fire in that radius.

03:16:24.690 --> 03:16:27.488
MATT: Drop your wolf form.

03:16:27.488 --> 03:16:28.806
MARISHA: 20-foot cube.

03:16:28.806 --> 03:16:30.255
SAM: Mark that shit.

03:16:30.255 --> 03:16:33.322
MARISHA: Right here.

03:16:33.322 --> 03:16:34.656
MATT: Okay.

03:16:34.656 --> 03:16:40.340
MARISHA: Realizing my party members are clearly
stabbing at something.

03:16:40.340 --> 03:16:45.680
TALIESIN: I like it when he has to go to the book.
Makes me feel like there's, perhaps, things he

03:16:45.680 --> 03:16:46.755
doesn't know.

03:16:46.755 --> 03:16:49.640
SAM: Faerie Fire is an underused thing. It's
really cool.

03:16:49.640 --> 03:16:53.624
MATT: Yeah, so both of their forms all of a
sudden are outlined by this sparking purple halo

03:16:53.624 --> 03:16:55.631
that shows you directly where they are.

03:16:55.631 --> 03:16:56.613
SAM: Yes!

03:16:56.613 --> 03:17:00.400
MATT: All right. So that's your turn? You going to
move anywhere?

03:17:00.400 --> 03:17:03.799
MARISHA: I'll back up a tidbit.

03:17:03.799 --> 03:17:05.082
MATT: Okay.

03:17:05.082 --> 03:17:07.876
MARISHA: Just back up a smidge.

03:17:07.876 --> 03:17:13.769
MATT: Okay, as you back up an invisible form that
just got revealed swings out at you with a rapier,

03:17:13.769 --> 03:17:15.374
an attack of opportunity.

03:17:15.374 --> 03:17:16.642
MARISHA: Yeah, sure, whatever.

03:17:16.642 --> 03:17:17.746
TALIESIN: But, he's--

03:17:17.746 --> 03:17:21.723
MATT: At disadvantage on the attack. He has
advantage on her because he's-- although--

03:17:21.723 --> 03:17:23.322
MARISHA: I can see him now.

03:17:23.322 --> 03:17:24.512
MATT: You can see him, that's true.

03:17:24.512 --> 03:17:26.884
LAURA: This is confusing!

03:17:26.884 --> 03:17:29.356
MATT: Faerie Fire kind of made this weird.

03:17:29.356 --> 03:17:30.598
TRAVIS: To the books again!

03:17:30.598 --> 03:17:31.711
MATT: Indeed.

03:17:31.711 --> 03:17:33.105
MARISHA: Faerie Fire always makes it weird.

03:17:33.105 --> 03:17:38.339
TALIESIN: Ain't it the truth? Man, that Faerie
Fire.

03:17:38.339 --> 03:17:42.507
MATT: Just a minute, folks. Lot of overlapping
effects, here, because everyone has magic.

03:17:42.507 --> 03:17:46.395
SAM: Now's a good time to go to the store and
check out Critical Role t-shirt--

03:17:46.395 --> 03:17:51.418
MATT: Yeah, it doesn't benefit from Invisible.
It's at disadvantage. It has disadvantage on the

03:17:51.418 --> 03:17:54.058
attack. That is--

03:17:54.058 --> 03:17:56.365
SAM: Brand new t-shirt for sale, guys.

03:17:56.365 --> 03:17:57.877
MATT: And 15.

03:17:57.877 --> 03:17:58.713
MARISHA: Miss.

03:17:58.713 --> 03:18:08.075
MATT: Yeah, so (whoosh) as you back up. All right.
That ends your turn. Now, this guard gets up,

03:18:08.075 --> 03:18:16.542
(grunts) gets his crossbow, aims it up and,
looking around the room, aims it, this would be--

03:18:16.542 --> 03:18:29.124
seeing his friend turn on his boss briefly after
you shouted that song at him, is going to turn the

03:18:29.124 --> 03:18:30.612
crossbow on you.

03:18:30.612 --> 03:18:31.556
SAM: On me?!

03:18:31.556 --> 03:18:32.321
MATT: Yes.

03:18:32.321 --> 03:18:33.160
SAM: Jesus.

03:18:33.160 --> 03:18:36.595
MATT: That's going to be a 16 to hit?

03:18:36.595 --> 03:18:39.442
SAM: I don't even know any more. No one's attacked
me in a while.

03:18:39.442 --> 03:18:40.689
TALIESIN: It's your AC.

03:18:40.689 --> 03:18:42.607
SAM: It's 17.

03:18:42.607 --> 03:18:43.699
MATT: 17!

03:18:43.699 --> 03:18:46.073
SAM: Well, it's 15 plus two because I've got some
thing on.

03:18:46.073 --> 03:18:48.341
MARISHA: You've got the amulet on.

03:18:48.341 --> 03:18:54.552
MATT: All right. So, as it comes towards you, you just
duck out of the way and it passes and snags into

03:18:54.594 --> 03:19:00.776
the wall behind you (arrow landing sound). No hit.
The thug is then going to drop the crossbow on the

03:19:00.776 --> 03:19:06.189
ground and rushing up, pull out a mace that was
hanging from the side of its belt and engage you

03:19:06.189 --> 03:19:08.791
right there.

03:19:08.791 --> 03:19:10.124
TRAVIS: I thought he was coming for me.

03:19:10.124 --> 03:19:11.823
SAM: I thought so, too. That would have been
good!

03:19:11.823 --> 03:19:25.435
MATT: This guy is going to attempt to make two
attacks against Master Vouk Strono. Has advantage

03:19:25.435 --> 03:19:34.881
on them because Faerie Fire. That hits. And, two
attacks with a mace. That is 18. Yeah, hits with

03:19:34.881 --> 03:19:37.465
both. (whack whack) With the mace both times.

03:19:37.465 --> 03:19:40.020
MARISHA: Is that the guy who you charmed?
Awesome.

03:19:40.020 --> 03:19:41.132
TALIESIN: Nice.

03:19:41.132 --> 03:19:42.834
SAM: Wait. Who's this?

03:19:42.834 --> 03:19:44.317
LIAM: The guy you charmed.

03:19:44.317 --> 03:19:46.269
SAM: That's not my guy, Matt.

03:19:46.269 --> 03:19:47.073
MATT: That guy?

03:19:47.073 --> 03:19:49.071
SAM: Oh, that guy there is, yeah. Oh wait, he's
attacking my guy?

03:19:49.071 --> 03:19:51.342
MATT: No, he's attacking the guy that's
invisible.

03:19:51.342 --> 03:19:54.182
(laughter)

03:19:54.182 --> 03:19:59.548
MATT: Doing a total of 16 damage with his mace.
(whack whack) Bludgeoning. He's now going to try

03:19:59.548 --> 03:20:03.027
and make the saving throw to shrug it. What's the
DC on that?

03:20:03.027 --> 03:20:04.472
SAM: On my spell?

03:20:04.472 --> 03:20:05.418
MATT: Yeah.

03:20:05.418 --> 03:20:06.579
SAM: It's 19.

03:20:06.579 --> 03:20:12.577
MATT: 19. Yeah, he does not make it. Still under
control. That ends the thugs' turn. Top of the

03:20:12.577 --> 03:20:13.855
round. Percy, you're up!

03:20:13.855 --> 03:20:16.069
MARISHA: Go Percy, go Percy, go!

03:20:16.069 --> 03:20:20.863
TALIESIN: Sharpshooter against Kerrion.

03:20:20.863 --> 03:20:22.086
MATT: Sir Kerrion, okay.

03:20:22.086 --> 03:20:24.901
TALIESIN: Do I have advantage on that because of
Faerie Fire?

03:20:24.901 --> 03:20:32.062
MATT: It does not benefit from invisibility and
you have advantage. Yes, you do.

03:20:32.062 --> 03:20:35.564
Vox Machina: broken.

03:20:35.564 --> 03:20:37.613
(laughter)

03:20:37.613 --> 03:20:39.853
TALIESIN: 16.

03:20:39.853 --> 03:20:41.566
MATT: 16 to hit?

03:20:41.566 --> 03:20:42.567
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:20:42.567 --> 03:20:43.793
MATT: Misses.

03:20:43.793 --> 03:20:45.517
TALIESIN: Taking another shot.

03:20:45.517 --> 03:20:46.842
MARISHA: That was with advantage?

03:20:46.842 --> 03:20:47.804
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:20:47.804 --> 03:20:48.721
MARISHA: Pooper.

03:20:48.721 --> 03:20:51.295
TALIESIN: 20.

03:20:51.295 --> 03:20:52.676
MATT: 20 does hit.

03:20:52.676 --> 03:21:00.081
TALIESIN: 15 points of damage.

03:21:00.081 --> 03:21:05.683
MATT: 15. (gunshot) You see one blast hits the
wall and causes part of the wood to splinter

03:21:05.683 --> 03:21:11.910
outward. The second shot impacts the partially
invisible form. You can see a splash of blood

03:21:11.910 --> 03:21:17.047
across the desk in front. Partially spattering
across Vax and one of his guards.

03:21:17.047 --> 03:21:26.786
TALIESIN: Third shot with ice. No sharpshooter.
Natural 20!

03:21:26.786 --> 03:21:28.195
TRAVIS: What?!

03:21:28.195 --> 03:21:30.999
MARISHA: Percy rolls!

03:21:30.999 --> 03:21:32.783
TRAVIS: What the hell?!

03:21:32.783 --> 03:21:36.990
TALIESIN: It's making up for my gun failing four
times.

03:21:36.990 --> 03:21:38.520
TRAVIS: Whatever, you possessed Voldemort.

03:21:38.520 --> 03:21:39.590
TALIESIN: I know.

03:21:39.590 --> 03:21:43.220
TRAVIS: (laughing) Smoke arm.

03:21:43.220 --> 03:21:58.117
TALIESIN: Six, 16, 25, 31 points of damage. 31
points of damage with four points of that being

03:21:58.117 --> 03:22:01.606
ice damage.

03:22:01.606 --> 03:22:06.654
MATT: So, Percy: how do you want to do this?

03:22:06.654 --> 03:22:08.819
TRAVIS: He said that weird.

03:22:08.819 --> 03:22:10.352
MARISHA: This against Kerrion, right?

03:22:10.352 --> 03:22:11.789
MATT: This is against Sir Kerrion.

03:22:11.789 --> 03:22:15.798
SAM: Wow! How do you want to do this? That's the
logo that's on the shirt that's

03:22:15.798 --> 03:22:17.115
for sale right now.

03:22:17.115 --> 03:22:18.407
TALIESIN: Oh, stop it.

03:22:18.407 --> 03:22:20.736
TRAVIS: Is this the name on one of the barrels?

03:22:20.736 --> 03:22:21.779
MATT: Percy.

03:22:21.779 --> 03:22:22.830
TALIESIN: Don't cheapen this!

03:22:22.830 --> 03:22:23.941
SAM: Too late.

03:22:23.941 --> 03:22:29.705
MATT: Currently visible, at your disposal, Sir
Kerrion. You have enough of a shot to finish him

03:22:29.705 --> 03:22:36.328
off. The smoke is pushing you, "Vengeance.
Vengeance. Vengeance." Repeatedly echoing in the

03:22:36.328 --> 03:22:39.218
back of your mind. How do you want to do this?

03:22:39.218 --> 03:22:43.404
TALIESIN: I'm going to put on the mask, since he
still doesn't know who I am.

03:22:43.404 --> 03:22:52.679
MATT: Okay. You pull the mask down, the
bird-beaked element to the mask now wreathed in

03:22:52.679 --> 03:22:58.589
smoke, resembling, very closely, the entity that
made the original bargain with you.

03:22:58.662 --> 03:23:06.989
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk up to him. Yeah,
there's no way to drop the illusion. That's such a

03:23:06.989 --> 03:23:08.279
damn shame.

03:23:08.279 --> 03:23:09.879
SAM: Oh wait, you told me to!

03:23:09.879 --> 03:23:10.753
TALIESIN: I did.

03:23:10.753 --> 03:23:13.558
SAM: I could have; I didn't. Fuck! (laughs)

03:23:13.558 --> 03:23:17.105
MARISHA: Could you do it now, for flavor?

03:23:17.105 --> 03:23:24.105
TALIESIN: That's fine. The mask will do. I'm going
to take one last shot. I'm going to look right at

03:23:24.105 --> 03:23:33.805
him, I'm going to catch his eye. This is for the
de Rolos. And let me say: you were the one I was

03:23:33.805 --> 03:23:36.176
least looking forward to.

03:23:36.176 --> 03:23:38.130
TRAVIS: That's some cold shit!

03:23:38.130 --> 03:23:45.380
MATT: With that, the little bit of wreathed
magical energy you can barely make out an

03:23:45.380 --> 03:23:52.385
expression of horror on the face before the
resounding blast sound rocks the room. The actual

03:23:52.385 --> 03:23:59.094
bullet itself a trail of black smoke behind it as
it impacts the front of Sir Kerrion's face. The

03:23:59.094 --> 03:24:07.681
entirety of his head caving inward as the back
splatters across the scarred wooden wall behind

03:24:07.681 --> 03:24:17.251
him. The body slumps to the ground immediately.
You guys all glance over at Percy. You don't even

03:24:17.324 --> 03:24:28.481
see Percy, you just see a humanoid entity made of
black swirling smoke energy with the peaked beak

03:24:28.481 --> 03:24:30.618
of his mask poking through.

03:24:30.618 --> 03:24:34.965
MARISHA: Not 100% sure what's going on. Can I take
my Faerie Fire concentration that I still have up

03:24:34.965 --> 03:24:38.068
and move it over top of the black smoke figure?

03:24:38.068 --> 03:24:42.126
MATT: Can you move a Faerie Fire?

03:24:42.126 --> 03:24:44.072
MARISHA: I don't know; can I move a Faerie Fire?

03:24:44.072 --> 03:24:47.523
MATT: I think when you use it, it just stays where
it was. Could be wrong, but I'm

03:24:47.523 --> 03:24:48.928
pretty sure that's how it works.

03:24:48.928 --> 03:24:53.471
MARISHA: 20 feet; is he in it, perchance?

03:24:53.471 --> 03:24:59.284
MATT: From there, it's 20 foot, no. Not from where
you placed it right on him, unfortunately. That's

03:24:59.284 --> 03:25:03.510
okay. Yeah, no, it just happens once.

03:25:03.510 --> 03:25:04.830
MARISHA: Never mind.

03:25:04.830 --> 03:25:14.491
MATT: With that, you recoil from it and the voice
echoes in the back of your head, going "Yes."

03:25:14.491 --> 03:25:16.568
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop the gun.

03:25:16.568 --> 03:25:18.706
MATT: You drop it (impact sound).

03:25:18.706 --> 03:25:26.320
TALIESIN: Remove my mask. Run to find something
metal, something sharp, anywhere on the table. And

03:25:26.320 --> 03:25:30.636
just start scratching off the name on the gun. I'm
just going to go to a corner and just start

03:25:30.636 --> 03:25:33.323
scratching the name off.

03:25:33.419 --> 03:25:34.384
MATT: Okay.

03:25:34.384 --> 03:25:37.675
SAM: He's disturbed.

03:25:37.675 --> 03:25:40.955
MATT: Okay, that's your turn.

03:25:40.955 --> 03:25:42.027
TALIESIN: That's my turn.

03:25:42.027 --> 03:25:51.254
MATT: Sir Kerrion is gone. Annihilated. That
brings us to Grog.

03:25:51.254 --> 03:25:55.774
TRAVIS: Percy's having all the fun. And I start
smashing that fuck that's looking at Vax.

03:25:55.774 --> 03:26:00.090
MATT: Right there, okay. So you move up to him,
(whoosh) swinging the hammer wide.

03:26:00.090 --> 03:26:04.559
TRAVIS: Might as well make these great weapon
master strikes, just for fucking why not.

03:26:04.559 --> 03:26:08.475
That's a 15.

03:26:08.475 --> 03:26:10.520
MATT: 15 just hits.

03:26:10.520 --> 03:26:18.479
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's awesome. And the second one--
Yeah, that's pretty good. 28 minus five. 23.

03:26:18.479 --> 03:26:19.841
MATT: 23 hits.

03:26:19.841 --> 03:26:27.378
TRAVIS: Okay. 15. 20 is the first one, with the
fire damage. Oh!

03:26:27.378 --> 03:26:28.831
LAURA: Actually that's 30.

03:26:28.831 --> 03:26:37.231
TRAVIS: Yeah, 30 is the first one. Plus 10. And
13, 16, 26 for the second one.

03:26:37.231 --> 03:26:42.446
MATT: Okay. So as you rush up, you can see, it's
pulled out its mace and is swinging it in a wide

03:26:42.446 --> 03:26:47.049
arc towards Vax. As soon as you rush up, it looks
to you out of the corner of the eye, drops the

03:26:47.049 --> 03:26:52.458
mace and before the mace can hit the ground, your
hammer actually swings around, hits the mace, and

03:26:52.458 --> 03:26:57.244
then both your hammer and the mace slam into the
side of his head, pushing him down onto the desk.

03:26:57.244 --> 03:27:04.012
Stunned, blood spatters across the wood as he's
(gasping) twitching on the table, already done.

03:27:04.012 --> 03:27:10.973
And you swing the hammer, lift it up, (impact
sound), like Gallagher performance, the head just

03:27:10.973 --> 03:27:12.225
(explosion noise).

03:27:12.225 --> 03:27:14.481
(groaning)

03:27:14.481 --> 03:27:16.233
LAURA: This is disgusting.

03:27:16.233 --> 03:27:19.337
LIAM: Happy Halloween, folks.

03:27:19.337 --> 03:27:23.033
TRAVIS: Great weapon master.

03:27:23.033 --> 03:27:28.782
MATT: Vouk is currently looking very--

03:27:28.782 --> 03:27:30.216
SAM: He's Vouk-ed.

03:27:30.216 --> 03:27:44.094
MATT: Yeah, he's Vouk-ed. All right. Is going to
cast Haste on himself and is going to run,

03:27:44.121 --> 03:27:48.419
dropping invisibility, and leaping through that
window.

03:27:48.419 --> 03:27:50.374
LAURA: Doesn't the guard get a--

03:27:50.374 --> 03:27:53.133
MATT: The guard gets an attack of opportunity, and
Keyleth does.

03:27:53.133 --> 03:27:58.943
The guard has advantage. A three. No, the
guard misses, with a mace.

03:27:58.943 --> 03:28:00.343
MARISHA: Natural 20.

03:28:00.343 --> 03:28:01.844
LAURA: Yeah! With your fire hands?

03:28:01.844 --> 03:28:07.483
MARISHA: No, it's with my staff, I'm assuming,
right? Unless I wanted to deck him in the face.

03:28:07.483 --> 03:28:08.894
MATT: No, this would be with your staff.

03:28:08.894 --> 03:28:09.981
MARISHA: This is with my staff, okay.

03:28:09.981 --> 03:28:11.737
MATT: You just (whack).

03:28:11.737 --> 03:28:24.033
MARISHA: So it's five, so that's 11. I don't
attack a lot. 13 damage.

03:28:24.033 --> 03:28:25.697
MATT: 13 damage?

03:28:25.697 --> 03:28:27.075
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:28:27.075 --> 03:28:30.750
MATT: All righty. As you smack him at that
point--

03:28:30.750 --> 03:28:33.357
MARISHA: I just clothesline him. I see him
running, I'm like (grunts).

03:28:33.357 --> 03:28:35.071
MATT: It brings him exactly to zero.

03:28:35.071 --> 03:28:36.471
(cheering)

03:28:36.471 --> 03:28:42.488
MATT: You whack him right in the face, knocking
the teeth out, and he just falls to the ground.

03:28:42.488 --> 03:28:46.638
Unconscious and bleeding.

03:28:46.638 --> 03:28:48.265
SAM: Good, yes, keep him alive.

03:28:48.265 --> 03:29:01.549
MATT: All right. That ends his turn (laughs). Wow.
Man. Surprise rounds, man. You guys are nasty. All

03:29:01.549 --> 03:29:04.295
right. Scanlan, you're up.

03:29:04.295 --> 03:29:05.445
SAM: Scanlan's up?

03:29:05.445 --> 03:29:06.457
MATT: Yeah.

03:29:06.457 --> 03:29:13.319
SAM: All right. I go run up to the guard I have
dominated, and I just-- Is he still dominated, can

03:29:13.319 --> 03:29:14.780
I change the domination?

03:29:14.780 --> 03:29:17.429
MATT: I mean, you can cancel it, but otherwise
he's just--

03:29:17.429 --> 03:29:21.149
SAM: I mean, can I change it from "kill your boss"
to--

03:29:21.149 --> 03:29:22.150
TRAVIS: "Kill yourself."

03:29:22.150 --> 03:29:23.623
SAM: To "give up"?

03:29:23.623 --> 03:29:27.989
MATT: Yeah, you can tell him. You can't tell him
to attack himself.

03:29:27.989 --> 03:29:29.330
SAM: No, I will tell him--

03:29:29.330 --> 03:29:32.280
TALIESIN: You-- Oh, go ahead.

03:29:32.280 --> 03:29:33.299
SAM: No, what?

03:29:33.299 --> 03:29:36.392
TALIESIN: I was going to say, tell him to go tell
anybody else in the house everything's fine.

03:29:36.392 --> 03:29:38.257
SAM: Oh. Ooh! That's good.

03:29:38.257 --> 03:29:41.817
TRAVIS: Yeah, because we should kill the more
powerful guy.

03:29:41.817 --> 03:29:43.469
TALIESIN: Tell him that everything's fine.

03:29:43.469 --> 03:29:49.346
SAM: Okay. You there, guard! Go tell everyone that
everything's fine. Go into that Stinking Cloud out

03:29:49.346 --> 03:29:53.130
there and tell all your friends that everything's
hunky-dory.

03:29:53.130 --> 03:29:55.937
MATT: Technically, Stinking Cloud is a
concentration spell.

03:29:55.996 --> 03:29:57.202
SAM: Is it?

03:29:57.202 --> 03:30:00.146
MATT: So if you were to maintain concentration on
that, you would lose your Domination.

03:30:00.146 --> 03:30:01.157
SAM: Oh, okay.

03:30:01.157 --> 03:30:03.078
MATT: So it's your call. Which one do you want to
maintain?

03:30:03.078 --> 03:30:05.164
SAM: The domination.

03:30:05.164 --> 03:30:07.246
MATT: Okay. So the Stinking Cloud fades from the
hallway.

03:30:07.246 --> 03:30:10.555
SAM: Stinking Cloud is concentration?

03:30:10.555 --> 03:30:13.213
MATT: I believe it is. Spells like that usually
are, if it's to maintain--

03:30:13.213 --> 03:30:15.852
SAM: It is! I never wrote down a C next to it.

03:30:15.852 --> 03:30:18.569
MATT: This is where that circlet would come in
handy.

03:30:18.569 --> 03:30:22.320
TALIESIN: Can I run over to Kerrion's body?

03:30:22.320 --> 03:30:24.550
MATT: You will be able to shortly.

03:30:24.550 --> 03:30:28.333
SAM: You mean the thing that Orion took from me?
Yeah, the thing that I needed? Yeah.

03:30:28.417 --> 03:30:31.205
MATT: It's all right. He's used it pretty well a
couple of times.

03:30:31.205 --> 03:30:38.436
SAM: Yes, so I tell him to go warn his friends--
not warn his friends. Tell his friends that

03:30:38.436 --> 03:30:40.170
everything's fine. All is good.

03:30:40.170 --> 03:30:48.208
MATT: Cool. Good to know. That ends your turn. Is
anyone going to take any specific actions?

03:30:48.208 --> 03:30:50.619
LAURA: I want to loot the bodies.

03:30:50.619 --> 03:30:54.404
TALIESIN: I'm running over to Kerrion and just
going to rage loot him.

03:30:54.404 --> 03:30:56.966
SAM: I'm going to go to the desk.

03:30:56.966 --> 03:31:06.515
MATT: Okay. While you guys all do that, the guard
leaves the room. You hear a few whispers in the

03:31:06.515 --> 03:31:09.614
hallway, a conversation with a person unseen.

03:31:09.614 --> 03:31:14.858
LIAM: I walk towards the door.

03:31:14.858 --> 03:31:16.708
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

03:31:16.708 --> 03:31:20.717
SAM: A giant attacks.

03:31:20.717 --> 03:31:29.688
MATT: The conversation fades and the guard walks
back, seemingly job done. Also is going to make a

03:31:29.688 --> 03:31:32.767
wisdom saving throw. That is a 17?

03:31:32.767 --> 03:31:33.660
SAM: 19.

03:31:33.660 --> 03:31:42.573
MATT: He remains dominated. You guys now-- For the
moment, the threat seems to have subsided. At the

03:31:42.573 --> 03:31:48.277
moment. You're still in the house and there's
still, apparently, things in the house. Whether

03:31:48.277 --> 03:31:52.014
it'd be guards or other individuals in the house
that are on edge as they heard a series of

03:31:52.014 --> 03:32:01.631
gunshots ring out, screams, and other sorts of
cacophony. The fact that this is even right now

03:32:01.631 --> 03:32:06.718
being handled is a very lucky series of rolls on
his part.

03:32:06.718 --> 03:32:11.371
TRAVIS: I want it said that this one should die.
He has magic. He's too strong. They could set

03:32:11.371 --> 03:32:12.645
better traps.

03:32:12.645 --> 03:32:17.294
SAM: We can interrogate him, though. Get crucial
information. He's an officer.

03:32:17.294 --> 03:32:18.767
TALIESIN: I can't talk yet.

03:32:18.767 --> 03:32:20.294
MATT: So you're going through Sir Kerrion's body.

03:32:20.294 --> 03:32:25.430
TALIESIN: I'm taking his swords, and I'm going to
use his sword to get that deep

03:32:25.430 --> 03:32:26.921
gouge into the gun.

03:32:26.921 --> 03:32:31.179
MATT: He has two rapiers, so it's like holding a
stiletto.

03:32:31.179 --> 03:32:35.772
TALIESIN: And anything he has on his body, I'm
taking it.

03:32:35.772 --> 03:32:41.507
MATT: He has a potion of greater healing on him.
Never got round to actually using it.

03:32:41.507 --> 03:32:48.629
TALIESIN: And once there's a good gash in the
name, I'm going to sit down and breathe.

03:32:48.629 --> 03:32:54.148
MATT: Okay. As you finish gashing the name out on
the side of the metal and start breathing, you can

03:32:54.148 --> 03:33:01.333
see the name itself begin to glow with a slight
dull purple glow and burn away from the metal,

03:33:01.333 --> 03:33:14.038
leaving just the scratch marks. From his body, you
have two rapiers, regular rapiers, studded leather

03:33:14.038 --> 03:33:18.861
armor that is enchanted with a plus one bonus, and
that potion of greater healing. So you can mark

03:33:18.861 --> 03:33:19.966
those down.

03:33:19.966 --> 03:33:21.938
LAURA: I'm keeping a very strong eye on Percy
right now.

03:33:21.938 --> 03:33:22.854
MATT: Okay.

03:33:22.854 --> 03:33:25.416
SAM: Anything on the desk, papers of any sort?

03:33:25.416 --> 03:33:28.558
MATT: Going through the desk? Go ahead and make an
investigation check.

03:33:28.558 --> 03:33:32.347
SAM: It's a lot. Yeah, it's tons. It's 27.

03:33:32.347 --> 03:33:44.376
MATT: Yeah. You find wax seals, you find
parchment, you find pocket change, about six or

03:33:44.376 --> 03:33:48.776
seven gold pieces just left in there. On himself
though, on his actual person, on Sir Kerrion's

03:33:48.776 --> 03:34:02.098
body, you find about 320 gold pieces as his own
personal fund. Looking through the desk, you find

03:34:02.098 --> 03:34:09.246
mentions of the bridge plan to move between the
two continents. To go across the channel to

03:34:09.246 --> 03:34:15.780
Wildmount. Basically plans, the discussion, a lot
of what they were planning to do with Emon.

03:34:15.780 --> 03:34:18.263
MARISHA: Someone write that down.

03:34:18.263 --> 03:34:19.630
SAM: I got it.

03:34:19.630 --> 03:34:23.507
MATT: You also find a small notebook that just has
some hand notes of his.

03:34:23.507 --> 03:34:25.204
SAM: I'll take it.

03:34:25.204 --> 03:34:27.149
MATT: Okay. So mark that down.

03:34:27.149 --> 03:34:32.307
TRAVIS: I start tying up unconscious guy on the
floor.

03:34:32.307 --> 03:34:35.611
MATT: He's currently-- He's got to zero hit
points, he's bleeding out.

03:34:35.611 --> 03:34:41.333
MARISHA: What about the dominated guy? He's about
to save from it. Domination, he can save from it

03:34:41.333 --> 03:34:42.449
at any second.

03:34:42.449 --> 03:34:45.173
TRAVIS: No, I know. I thought we wanted to
interrogate--

03:34:45.173 --> 03:34:47.407
MATT: Which he does not; he's still dominated.

03:34:47.407 --> 03:34:52.034
LIAM: I take a rag out of my pocket and I roll it
up and I shove it into Kerrion's mouth while Grog

03:34:52.034 --> 03:34:53.207
is tying him up.

03:34:53.207 --> 03:34:54.444
TALIESIN: Kerrion's dead.

03:34:54.444 --> 03:34:55.623
LIAM: I thought he was out.

03:34:55.623 --> 03:34:57.029
SAM: Vouk's.

03:34:57.029 --> 03:34:58.366
TRAVIS: The balding guy.

03:34:58.366 --> 03:34:59.449
LIAM: Balding. All right.

03:34:59.449 --> 03:35:03.510
TRAVIS: We tie him up, he shoves a rag in his
mouth, I put one hand on the top of his head and

03:35:03.510 --> 03:35:06.904
the other hand under his chin. Should we bring him
back just a little so we can ask him some

03:35:06.904 --> 03:35:07.905
questions?

03:35:07.905 --> 03:35:08.824
MARISHA: Vouk?

03:35:08.824 --> 03:35:09.778
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:35:09.778 --> 03:35:13.056
MARISHA: Okay, but what are we going to do about
dominated guy? Can we tie him up, too?

03:35:13.125 --> 03:35:15.456
LAURA: Yeah, tell him to go sit in a corner,
Scanlan.

03:35:15.456 --> 03:35:18.510
MARISHA: He could save from that any second. We
need to like off him or something.

03:35:18.510 --> 03:35:19.594
TALIESIN: There'll be time for that.

03:35:19.594 --> 03:35:22.117
LIAM: I got it. Could you tell him to look in the
corner?

03:35:22.117 --> 03:35:26.822
SAM: Turn away, look in the corner, Blair Witch
style.

03:35:26.822 --> 03:35:29.622
(laughter)

03:35:29.622 --> 03:35:34.304
LAURA: Oh, this is so wrong.

03:35:34.304 --> 03:35:35.851
MATT: Doesn't make his save.

03:35:35.851 --> 03:35:36.839
LAURA: Oh, terrible.

03:35:36.839 --> 03:35:38.278
SAM: Grog, do you want to?

03:35:38.278 --> 03:35:39.893
LAURA: No, this is so wrong.

03:35:39.893 --> 03:35:46.839
TRAVIS: What? We're asking questions. We got to
bring him back, just a little bit.

03:35:46.839 --> 03:35:48.469
SAM: Are you on Vouk's right? Or
whatever-his-name?

03:35:48.469 --> 03:35:49.679
TRAVIS: We're on Vouk.

03:35:49.679 --> 03:35:53.280
LIAM: Can we put him to sleep, or anything short
of me knocking him out?

03:35:53.280 --> 03:35:55.109
SAM: I can put him to sleep.

03:35:55.109 --> 03:35:56.423
LIAM: Put him to sleep, then.

03:35:56.423 --> 03:35:58.363
SAM: But I have to drop my thing first.

03:35:58.363 --> 03:36:00.047
LAURA: Just knock him out.

03:36:00.047 --> 03:36:03.951
LIAM: I'll do it. I'm really good at knocking
people out.

03:36:03.951 --> 03:36:09.530
MARISHA: Just knock him out. Knowing what's
coming, I'm going to Druidcraft some pretty

03:36:09.530 --> 03:36:14.980
kaleidoscope-y flowers in front of his face.
Pretty image before you die.

03:36:14.980 --> 03:36:21.839
MATT: All right. He seems momentarily confused
before the blow of the-- Are you hitting him with

03:36:21.839 --> 03:36:22.883
the blade or pommel?

03:36:22.883 --> 03:36:23.908
LIAM: Oh, pommel.

03:36:23.908 --> 03:36:27.750
TRAVIS: Before we knock him out, should you make
sure that whatever he tells people is truly

03:36:27.750 --> 03:36:30.640
fearsome? But not too descript about us?

03:36:30.640 --> 03:36:33.459
SAM: Well, he already told his friends in the
hallway--

03:36:33.459 --> 03:36:34.556
TRAVIS: That everything was fine.

03:36:34.556 --> 03:36:36.813
SAM: That everything's fine. So now we're just
knocking him out.

03:36:36.813 --> 03:36:45.569
MARISHA: While all this happens, I'm going over to
baldy. Lord Vouk or Mister Vouk and pop a Cure

03:36:45.569 --> 03:36:51.620
Wounds potion into him. How far down is he? He was
just at zero. I brought him to zero.

03:36:51.620 --> 03:36:56.119
MATT: Yeah, he was unconscious and he was making
his death saving throws. I was treating him for

03:36:56.119 --> 03:36:59.025
that circumstance. When you go straight to zero
like that, you know--

03:36:59.025 --> 03:37:00.981
MARISHA: Yeah. All right, I'll pop a Cure Wounds
into him.

03:37:00.981 --> 03:37:02.015
MATT: Okay.

03:37:02.015 --> 03:37:05.928
LIAM: The guy in the corner? Scanlan, could you go
stand next to him and tell him a joke?

03:37:05.928 --> 03:37:08.797
MARISHA: I was giving him pretty flowers.

03:37:08.797 --> 03:37:10.619
LIAM: You're standing next to him?

03:37:10.619 --> 03:37:13.717
MARISHA: I gave him pretty flowers to look at.

03:37:13.717 --> 03:37:15.069
LIAM: You walked over and gave him pretty
flowers?

03:37:15.069 --> 03:37:16.528
MARISHA: I Druidcrafted from a distance.

03:37:16.528 --> 03:37:18.105
TRAVIS: Are you standing next to him?

03:37:18.105 --> 03:37:21.722
SAM: I walk next to him and sort of distract him
with a little soft shoe tap.

03:37:21.722 --> 03:37:39.092
LIAM: Thank you. That's what I needed. I got an
18. Sorry, I got a 29. And that is eight plus 14,

03:37:39.092 --> 03:37:44.750
22, six, seven, 32.

03:37:44.825 --> 03:37:53.927
MATT: 32. He is (impact noise) from barely damaged
to nothing. He goes immediately unconscious in the

03:37:53.927 --> 03:37:56.710
corner, face down, in the middle of a bookcase.

03:37:56.710 --> 03:38:02.559
MARISHA: I drop 18 points of healing into Vouk.

03:38:02.559 --> 03:38:11.311
MATT: Okay. (gasps, chokes)

03:38:11.311 --> 03:38:16.601
TRAVIS: The rag's in his throat. You are going to
listen very carefully as my friends ask you some

03:38:16.601 --> 03:38:20.799
questions. You'll shake your head yes or shake it
no.

03:38:20.799 --> 03:38:28.056
LAURA: What are we going to ask him?

03:38:28.056 --> 03:38:30.163
SAM: (laughs) Percy?

03:38:30.163 --> 03:38:33.344
TALIESIN: I'm not available right now.

03:38:33.344 --> 03:38:35.211
SAM and LIAM: All right.

03:38:35.211 --> 03:38:36.440
LIAM: Come on. Come with me.

03:38:36.440 --> 03:38:37.582
LAURA: Okay.

03:38:37.582 --> 03:38:39.022
SAM: Where are the Briarwoods?

03:38:39.022 --> 03:38:40.091
LAURA: Where are the Briarwoods?

03:38:40.091 --> 03:38:41.383
LIAM: You've got to do yes or no.

03:38:41.383 --> 03:38:42.457
LAURA: Are the Briarwoods--

03:38:42.457 --> 03:38:45.420
SAM: -- in the palace?

03:38:45.420 --> 03:38:46.784
MATT: (muffled moaning)

03:38:46.784 --> 03:38:47.866
LIAM: Yes or no.

03:38:47.866 --> 03:38:49.071
SAM: Just nod or nod.

03:38:49.071 --> 03:38:50.911
LAURA: This is really smart. I feel good about
this.

03:38:50.911 --> 03:38:52.055
TRAVIS: Should we take the rag out?

03:38:52.055 --> 03:38:53.199
LAURA: No.

03:38:53.199 --> 03:38:54.442
SAM: He can do spells.

03:38:54.442 --> 03:38:58.297
LIAM: I just want to remind you that my friend
over here can split you in

03:38:58.297 --> 03:39:00.461
half like an apple, right?

03:39:00.461 --> 03:39:03.016
TRAVIS: I nod his head yes.

03:39:03.016 --> 03:39:04.959
MATT: (muffled murmur)

03:39:04.959 --> 03:39:07.626
LIAM: Have you seen the Briarwoods this week?

03:39:07.626 --> 03:39:09.424
MATT: (affirmative grunt)

03:39:09.424 --> 03:39:12.828
LIAM: Do you like working for them?

03:39:12.828 --> 03:39:16.022
MATT: (sounds uncertain)

03:39:16.022 --> 03:39:17.853
LAURA: Do they know we're here?

03:39:17.853 --> 03:39:19.328
MATT: (affirmative grunt)

03:39:19.328 --> 03:39:21.566
LAURA: Yeah.

03:39:21.566 --> 03:39:23.442
SAM: Are they in the palace?

03:39:23.442 --> 03:39:25.396
MATT: (sounds ambiguous)

03:39:25.396 --> 03:39:26.468
SAM: Sometimes.

03:39:26.468 --> 03:39:28.460
LAURA: Do you know where they are?

03:39:28.460 --> 03:39:30.363
MATT: (negative grunt)

03:39:30.363 --> 03:39:33.639
LIAM: Do they have pointier teeth than most?

03:39:33.715 --> 03:39:36.336
MATT: (sounds ambiguous)

03:39:36.336 --> 03:39:38.288
SAM: (laughs)

03:39:38.288 --> 03:39:39.940
MATT: (sounds sad)

03:39:39.940 --> 03:39:41.259
SAM: This is mumblecore.

03:39:41.259 --> 03:39:42.445
LAURA: Yeah.

03:39:42.445 --> 03:39:46.467
LIAM: Is your life worth giving a little
information?

03:39:46.467 --> 03:39:48.905
MATT: (affirmative grunting)

03:39:48.905 --> 03:39:55.237
LIAM: We want to know how to get into the palace
without a problem. Got any advice?

03:39:55.237 --> 03:39:57.919
MATT: (eager affirmative grunting)

03:39:57.919 --> 03:40:03.506
LIAM: Now I just want to remind you. He can take
your head off, your knees off, your cock off,

03:40:03.506 --> 03:40:05.249
anything, in half a second.

03:40:05.249 --> 03:40:07.008
TRAVIS: I just give a little squeeze.

03:40:07.008 --> 03:40:10.119
LIAM: I'm going to pull the cloth out.

03:40:10.119 --> 03:40:11.985
SAM: I cast Blindness on him.

03:40:11.985 --> 03:40:13.494
MATT: Okay.

03:40:13.494 --> 03:40:20.934
SAM: Don't know if he's blind.

03:40:20.934 --> 03:40:23.380
MATT: Suddenly he goes (muffled panic noises).

03:40:23.380 --> 03:40:24.995
SAM: Oh, he's blind. He's blind.

03:40:24.995 --> 03:40:26.945
LIAM: I give him a pat on the cheek.

03:40:26.945 --> 03:40:28.341
MATT: (whimpers)

03:40:28.341 --> 03:40:29.522
LAURA: Oh, now I feel bad.

03:40:29.522 --> 03:40:33.371
LIAM: I'm a big fan of efficiency, so I'm going to
pull this rag out and you've got about 30 seconds

03:40:33.371 --> 03:40:38.141
to start talking about something useful.
Otherwise, my friend is going to make you about

03:40:38.141 --> 03:40:39.533
six inches shorter.

03:40:39.533 --> 03:40:42.014
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm going to turn your head into a
dreidel.

03:40:42.014 --> 03:40:45.483
LIAM: So we're going to start talking now, yes?

03:40:45.527 --> 03:40:47.450
MATT: (grunts in agreement)

03:40:47.450 --> 03:40:49.780
LIAM: In three, two.

03:40:49.780 --> 03:40:58.308
MATT: (gasping for breath) "Please don't kill me.
I can show you a secret entrance into the castle.

03:40:58.308 --> 03:41:00.038
"I know a way in."

03:41:00.038 --> 03:41:01.488
LAURA: It's not guarded?

03:41:01.488 --> 03:41:07.468
MATT: "I don't think so. They've closed it off. If
you can find a way through, they won't expect it."

03:41:07.468 --> 03:41:09.923
TALIESIN: Is it the one in the forest?

03:41:09.923 --> 03:41:17.475
MATT: "There is one, yes, yes, in the forest.
Look, I can bring you to their project room under

03:41:17.475 --> 03:41:21.421
"the castle, what they're working on. Please don't
kill me."

03:41:21.421 --> 03:41:23.267
LAURA: What is the project room?

03:41:23.267 --> 03:41:25.188
SAM: Are they working on explosives?

03:41:25.188 --> 03:41:34.999
MATT: "They've been-- They've been working on
something. It's hard to describe. I've only been

03:41:34.999 --> 03:41:40.110
"there once. It's beyond my interests, but it is
part of the reason they even took this place."

03:41:40.110 --> 03:41:44.230
LIAM: Lord Briarwood is a vampire.

03:41:44.230 --> 03:41:46.287
MATT: "Aye."

03:41:46.287 --> 03:41:49.151
LIAM: What the fuck is Lady Briarwood?

03:41:49.151 --> 03:41:54.846
MATT: "She's powerful, I'll give you that. She
scares me more than the two of them."

03:41:54.899 --> 03:42:01.220
LAURA: Is it hard to talk with no teeth?

03:42:01.220 --> 03:42:04.693
MATT: "It's more difficult than expected, aye."

03:42:04.693 --> 03:42:11.592
TRAVIS: I start to tilt his head and I'm like:
showing us won't work, we need a location.

03:42:11.592 --> 03:42:21.275
MATT: "It's under the castle. It's under the city.
All the caverns are there. I can show you how to

03:42:21.275 --> 03:42:23.889
"get there, I've been there. They've taken me."

03:42:23.889 --> 03:42:30.135
LAURA: Do you know what they've done to the ground
here? Do you know why nothing grows?

03:42:30.135 --> 03:42:33.058
MATT: "Stuff grows. It's how we do the farming."

03:42:33.058 --> 03:42:38.993
MARISHA: Stuff doesn't &lt;i&gt;grow,&lt;/i&gt; though. Not like it
should. What did they do to the land?

03:42:38.993 --> 03:42:42.427
MATT: "I don't know. Maybe it has something to do
with what they're doing under the castle."

03:42:42.427 --> 03:42:45.371
MARISHA: And what exactly are they doing under the
castle?

03:42:45.371 --> 03:42:51.839
MATT: "It's an excavation, or they're building
something. I don't know the details of it."

03:42:51.839 --> 03:42:54.728
LIAM: You've no idea what they want?

03:42:54.728 --> 03:43:04.284
MATT: "Comparatively, I'm just a peasant to them.
I work with-- well, I &lt;i&gt;worked&lt;/i&gt; with Kerrion."

03:43:04.284 --> 03:43:10.677
TALIESIN: How long have you worked with Sir
Stonefell?

03:43:10.677 --> 03:43:12.738
MATT: "Five years."

03:43:12.738 --> 03:43:15.347
TALIESIN: Were you here when he took the castle?

03:43:15.347 --> 03:43:18.311
MATT: "Yes, yes. I was part of the incursion."

03:43:18.311 --> 03:43:27.413
TALIESIN: Good. You're very lucky. Because you're
going to live if you show us--

03:43:27.413 --> 03:43:29.482
And I bring out a map.

03:43:29.482 --> 03:43:31.573
SAM: He can't see anything.

03:43:31.573 --> 03:43:34.520
TALIESIN: I know. Drop the Blindness.

03:43:34.520 --> 03:43:36.906
MATT: He hears the crinkling of paper.

03:43:36.906 --> 03:43:38.433
TALIESIN: Drop the Blindness.

03:43:38.433 --> 03:43:41.095
SAM: All right. I drop Blindness and I drop
Seeming.

03:43:41.095 --> 03:43:43.407
MATT: (scared, fast breathing)

03:43:43.407 --> 03:43:50.559
TALIESIN: Look at me. Look at me. You're going to
show me where on the castle is the secret

03:43:50.559 --> 03:43:53.904
entrance. Do you know who I am?

03:43:53.904 --> 03:43:55.356
MATT: "No."

03:43:55.356 --> 03:43:59.517
TALIESIN: You will. Mark it on the map.

03:43:59.517 --> 03:44:02.292
MATT: He looks down at his bound arms and legs.

03:44:02.292 --> 03:44:07.362
TRAVIS: I take his head and I shove his nose and
his face right above the map. And I say:

03:44:07.421 --> 03:44:09.153
use your nose.

03:44:09.153 --> 03:44:20.769
MATT: "It's right--" He spits and puts a little
droplet. It's loosely in the area of the western

03:44:20.769 --> 03:44:26.760
side of the mountain that the castle is built on.
Roughly around the entrance where you escaped when

03:44:26.760 --> 03:44:30.524
you and Cassandra left Whitestone, five years
before.

03:44:30.524 --> 03:44:32.497
TALIESIN: I know where that is.

03:44:32.497 --> 03:44:35.509
TRAVIS: That means we don't need you anymore.

03:44:35.509 --> 03:44:41.890
MATT: "No! I can show you-- I can show you where
their project is. The tunnels. You need me."

03:44:41.890 --> 03:44:44.885
TRAVIS: He'll set a good trap.

03:44:44.885 --> 03:44:49.982
LAURA: I just want to ask, when do the Briarwoods
come out?

03:44:49.982 --> 03:44:59.892
MATT: "Not often. They don't need to. Kerrion does
the work for them. Did the work for them."

03:44:59.892 --> 03:45:02.670
SAM: Those giants. Who controls them?

03:45:02.670 --> 03:45:05.648
MATT: "Lady Briarwood does. She's the one who made
them."

03:45:05.648 --> 03:45:07.378
TRAVIS: It's all over the room.

03:45:07.378 --> 03:45:09.188
MARISHA: She's the one who made them?

03:45:09.188 --> 03:45:10.959
TALIESIN: Can I propose something to you?

03:45:10.959 --> 03:45:13.408
MATT: "She's strong with necromancy, she is."

03:45:13.408 --> 03:45:17.281
LIAM: I shove the rag back in his mouth for a
moment.

03:45:17.356 --> 03:45:20.708
TALIESIN: Mark his face, take his tongue, let him
loose.

03:45:20.708 --> 03:45:22.332
SAM: His eyes, too?

03:45:22.332 --> 03:45:23.967
TALIESIN: No, just his tongue.

03:45:23.967 --> 03:45:25.259
TRAVIS: His tongue?

03:45:25.259 --> 03:45:26.380
TALIESIN: Mark his face.

03:45:26.380 --> 03:45:31.566
TRAVIS: I stick my two fingers inside of his nose,
crank back on his nose, reach in, and rip his

03:45:31.566 --> 03:45:32.987
tongue out of his mouth.

03:45:32.987 --> 03:45:34.297
SAM: I cover Keyleth's eyes.

03:45:34.297 --> 03:45:35.961
TALIESIN: That was a bit more than I was--

03:45:35.961 --> 03:45:39.774
TRAVIS: You said take his tongue! That's a
natural 20.

03:45:39.948 --> 03:45:41.904
MARISHA: Natural 20?!

03:45:41.904 --> 03:45:45.504
TALIESIN: Natural 20, really? I'm feeling like
such a bastard right now.

03:45:45.504 --> 03:45:50.698
MATT: There isn't even a slow scuffle. You just
reach in and (wet ripping noise, pained scream)

03:45:50.698 --> 03:45:57.404
You immediately jam the cloth back in. The cloth
begins to slowly soak with blood. You hold almost

03:45:57.404 --> 03:46:04.741
a pound of muscle: a now motionless tongue in your
hand, bloody at its base. These tears are running

03:46:04.741 --> 03:46:08.851
down his face. (muffled sobbing and coughing)

03:46:08.851 --> 03:46:12.375
TRAVIS: Is that good enough for your message?

03:46:12.375 --> 03:46:18.596
TALIESIN: I take my gun. I'm going to shoot it
very gently-- I'm going to shoot into the ground

03:46:18.596 --> 03:46:28.023
to muffle the sound. I'm going to take the heat of
it, and I'm going to cauterize it. His tongue, so

03:46:28.023 --> 03:46:29.190
he doesn't bleed out.

03:46:29.190 --> 03:46:31.825
MATT: You pull the cloth out. (pained cry and
choking sounds)

03:46:31.825 --> 03:46:36.614
TALIESIN: I'm going to mark his head with the
still-hot gun.

03:46:36.614 --> 03:46:44.460
MATT: (noises of pain) He starts screaming in pain
as you're burning what into his head, the symbol

03:46:44.460 --> 03:46:45.876
of the de Rolo family?

03:46:45.876 --> 03:46:48.327
SAM: It's a very complicated symbol. (laughs)

03:46:48.327 --> 03:46:54.504
TALIESIN: I'm going to do it. And then, I say we
let him run out the front door and we set fire to

03:46:54.504 --> 03:46:55.558
the house.

03:46:55.558 --> 03:46:56.969
TRAVIS: I'm good with that. I've got this.

03:46:56.969 --> 03:46:58.010
SAM: Where are we going after this?

03:46:58.010 --> 03:46:59.367
MARISHA: Whoa!

03:46:59.367 --> 03:47:02.835
TRAVIS: No. I like that a lot.

03:47:02.835 --> 03:47:05.072
MARISHA: You would, though. You would.

03:47:05.072 --> 03:47:07.242
SAM: Trinket's downstairs. We should leave
Trinket.

03:47:07.242 --> 03:47:12.816
TRAVIS: Have we forgotten that this entire town is
full of evil, undead vampire people?

03:47:12.816 --> 03:47:16.359
MARISHA: Have we also forgotten that this entire
town is looking for us?

03:47:16.359 --> 03:47:17.903
TALIESIN: They don't know we're here.

03:47:17.903 --> 03:47:23.122
MARISHA: They will after we set fire on the house
and send a man screaming through the street with

03:47:23.122 --> 03:47:24.424
your symbol on his forehead.

03:47:24.424 --> 03:47:26.279
SAM: They don't know where we live.

03:47:26.279 --> 03:47:30.534
MARISHA: They will! They're going to go, "Hm,
let's look at the burning smokestack of a house

03:47:30.534 --> 03:47:31.645
"and start there."

03:47:31.645 --> 03:47:33.395
TALIESIN: He's going to be missing by morning.
They're going to know.

03:47:33.395 --> 03:47:37.379
TRAVIS: We've got the guy painted all over this
room. They're going to find out one way or the

03:47:37.379 --> 03:47:39.686
other. Might as well do it with a little
showmanship.

03:47:39.686 --> 03:47:43.370
SAM: We're trying to make everyone know that we're
here.

03:47:43.370 --> 03:47:45.436
TALIESIN: We're trying to start a rebellion.

03:47:45.436 --> 03:47:47.648
MARISHA: (voice cracking) Yeah, but-- yeah.

03:47:47.648 --> 03:47:50.001
TRAVIS: Come on, be the Mockingjay, Keyleth!

03:47:50.001 --> 03:47:55.050
TALIESIN: (giggles) Don't make me laugh. This is
dark shit.

03:47:55.118 --> 03:47:56.330
TRAVIS: It is!

03:47:56.330 --> 03:47:59.405
SAM: We can stay the night before we release him
and burn it down.

03:47:59.405 --> 03:48:00.381
TALIESIN: Fair.

03:48:00.381 --> 03:48:02.363
SAM: Although there are a bunch of guards around.

03:48:02.363 --> 03:48:03.932
MARISHA and LAURA: We can't stay the night.

03:48:03.932 --> 03:48:06.320
SAM: All right, just burn it, then. Let's get out
of here.

03:48:06.320 --> 03:48:15.328
MARISHA: Hang on. Fellow half-elves, you look as
horrified as I feel. What do you guys think?

03:48:15.328 --> 03:48:21.461
LAURA: I feel like it's a little stupid, since we
have nowhere to go.

03:48:21.461 --> 03:48:27.926
SAM: We can go back to our old hideout. We have
the tavern. No one's found it.

03:48:27.926 --> 03:48:32.779
LIAM: Percival, I know what you've been through,
to an extent.

03:48:32.779 --> 03:48:37.526
TALIESIN: I don't even know what I've been
through, to a certain extent, but yes.

03:48:37.526 --> 03:48:44.801
LIAM: We came here to wipe out a scourge on this
city. Careful lest you become the scourge you've

03:48:44.801 --> 03:48:53.691
come to destroy. These people have eaten shit for
five years. I'm not saying that man was innocent,

03:48:53.691 --> 03:49:03.913
but he's had a hard road. Everyone here has had a
hard road. I am maybe willing to overlook what's

03:49:03.913 --> 03:49:09.728
just happened for all the hardship you have had,
but careful how you are walking.

03:49:09.728 --> 03:49:17.139
SAM: Hey, wait a second here, Vax. That was an
enforcer. He kept the people oppressed. He worked

03:49:17.139 --> 03:49:20.910
for the Briarwoods and punished all of these
farmers for not bringing

03:49:20.910 --> 03:49:22.911
enough taxes and enough tithes.

03:49:22.911 --> 03:49:25.113
LIAM: Are we to turn into Jack the Ripper because
of it?

03:49:25.113 --> 03:49:27.016
SAM: Well, that's what a rebellion is.

03:49:27.016 --> 03:49:28.253
TRAVIS: I do like ripping.

03:49:28.253 --> 03:49:30.170
TALIESIN: There's no pretty way to do this.

03:49:30.170 --> 03:49:37.790
LAURA: I'm fully in support with burning down a
house, I just feel like it might backfire a bit.

03:49:37.790 --> 03:49:45.832
MARISHA: Look, I agreed to start a rebellion and
let the people have their uprising, but I'm with

03:49:45.832 --> 03:49:51.691
Vax. I was trying to tell you this before we even
came here, Percy. You don't want to become the

03:49:51.691 --> 03:49:59.374
thing that you are so desperate to seek vengeance
on. How are we any different than the Briarwoods,

03:49:59.374 --> 03:50:00.859
at this point?

03:50:00.859 --> 03:50:06.136
TRAVIS: We're not fucking vampires. Look, what are
our options besides burning the house down? I'm

03:50:06.136 --> 03:50:07.908
open to other ideas.

03:50:07.908 --> 03:50:11.300
SAM: We can just leave it as a symbol of our
terror.

03:50:11.300 --> 03:50:13.253
TALIESIN: I've marked him. I'm willing to walk
away.

03:50:13.253 --> 03:50:14.591
TRAVIS: And where do we stay?

03:50:14.591 --> 03:50:15.839
SAM: Somewhere else.

03:50:15.839 --> 03:50:19.438
TRAVIS: The tavern? Do we have to find another
building?

03:50:19.438 --> 03:50:21.911
TALIESIN: I know a barracks. It's not too far
away.

03:50:21.911 --> 03:50:25.954
LIAM: I agree with you, with burning the house
down. Let's find anyone who's in here

03:50:25.954 --> 03:50:27.344
and get them out.

03:50:27.344 --> 03:50:30.762
TALIESIN: I think they'll get out when the house
catches on fire.

03:50:30.762 --> 03:50:33.641
LIAM: Your soul doesn't need to be forfeit,
Percival.

03:50:33.641 --> 03:50:38.947
TALIESIN: (sighs heavily) Things are more
complicated now.

03:50:38.947 --> 03:50:41.697
SAM: Percy, is that last barrel for you?

03:50:41.697 --> 03:50:45.829
TALIESIN: No. But, if it was, would I tell you?

03:50:45.829 --> 03:50:47.103
SAM: No.

03:50:47.103 --> 03:50:48.419
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:50:48.419 --> 03:50:54.902
MARISHA: Why are things more complicated, Percy?
Clearly, we all just witnessed what just

03:50:54.902 --> 03:50:55.961
happened.

03:50:55.961 --> 03:51:00.940
TALIESIN: That was unexpected.

03:51:00.940 --> 03:51:04.624
MARISHA: Yeah, no, I'd agree with that, yeah.

03:51:04.624 --> 03:51:10.591
TALIESIN: (sighs) That's a longer conversation.

03:51:10.591 --> 03:51:16.733
SAM: These guards aren't going to stay out for
long. We should set fire and get out of here.

03:51:16.733 --> 03:51:20.543
LIAM: We burn the house down, and we find a place
to hole up for the night.

03:51:20.543 --> 03:51:22.281
LAURA: Hey, buddy. How's it going?

03:51:22.281 --> 03:51:26.185
MATT: He looks over at the body of Sir Kerrion,
which is still slumped against the wall.

03:51:26.185 --> 03:51:32.342
LIAM: Percy, we need to have that longer
conversation soon.

03:51:32.342 --> 03:51:34.415
LAURA: Soon, but not now. Let's go.

03:51:34.415 --> 03:51:38.049
MARISHA: Let's get out of here. All right, we're
setting this damn house on fire?

03:51:38.049 --> 03:51:39.377
LAURA: Let's do it.

03:51:39.377 --> 03:51:48.506
TRAVIS: I take the tongue-less one, and I throw
him out. I keep him bound. He's bound amongst the

03:51:48.506 --> 03:51:54.353
chest and hands. And I throw him out the window.
Bye, motherfucker!

03:51:54.353 --> 03:52:03.197
MATT: He falls out into the rain, (boof) falling
on his side. (whimpers) He's being rained on, and

03:52:03.197 --> 03:52:04.575
he's trying to struggle with his bindings.

03:52:04.575 --> 03:52:13.739
TRAVIS: He'll get up. His feet are free. His legs
and feet are free. I'm picturing chest and arms.

03:52:13.739 --> 03:52:15.727
MATT: Okay, then he gets to his feet and starts
running.

03:52:15.727 --> 03:52:19.498
SAM: Grog, can you carry this unconscious guard
out on our way out?

03:52:19.498 --> 03:52:21.182
TRAVIS: Sure. Do I kill him first?

03:52:21.182 --> 03:52:22.661
MATT: Are you leaving Sir Kerrion's body?

03:52:22.661 --> 03:52:23.821
SAM: Sir Kerrion's body?

03:52:23.821 --> 03:52:25.406
MATT: Are you leaving Sir Kerrion's body to burn
with the house?

03:52:25.406 --> 03:52:26.222
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:52:26.222 --> 03:52:27.028
LAURA: Are we?

03:52:27.028 --> 03:52:28.841
TALIESIN: Let's take him, too.

03:52:28.841 --> 03:52:34.975
TRAVIS: We might as well leave him out on the
front step, or something. I'll grab Sir Kerrion--

03:52:34.975 --> 03:52:36.571
SAM: Can you carry both of those fuckers?

03:52:36.571 --> 03:52:37.739
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:52:37.739 --> 03:52:39.073
MATT: He threw one of them out.

03:52:39.073 --> 03:52:41.163
SAM: No, there's the unconscious guard and the
body.

03:52:41.163 --> 03:52:43.502
TRAVIS: I'll grab unconscious guard and the body.

03:52:43.502 --> 03:52:45.184
LIAM: He weighs like 600 pounds.

03:52:45.184 --> 03:52:50.712
MARISHA: I'm going to say: All right. Well, if
we're going to light this damn house on fire and

03:52:50.712 --> 03:52:52.103
make it a symbol--

03:52:52.103 --> 03:52:53.406
SAM: You have fire hands.

03:52:53.406 --> 03:52:57.152
MARISHA: We're at least going to make it cool and
make it the message that it's supposed to be.

03:52:57.152 --> 03:52:58.296
TRAVIS: There you go!

03:52:58.296 --> 03:53:01.610
MARISHA: I turn into an eagle and I fly to the
roof.

03:53:01.610 --> 03:53:04.275
MATT: Flying out the window that you just
shattered.

03:53:04.275 --> 03:53:07.659
MARISHA: Give me your symbol.

03:53:07.659 --> 03:53:09.423
TALIESIN: I give her one of the parchments.

03:53:09.423 --> 03:53:15.706
MATT: You fly up. The rain is coming down on you.
It's a little hard to fly. You get up to the top

03:53:15.706 --> 03:53:16.769
of the roof.

03:53:16.769 --> 03:53:20.235
MARISHA: I cast Flaming Sphere.

03:53:20.235 --> 03:53:22.015
MATT: You transform into yourself again?

03:53:22.015 --> 03:53:23.098
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:53:23.098 --> 03:53:24.388
MATT: All righty.

03:53:24.388 --> 03:53:28.348
TALIESIN: We're all going to start going out the
way we came.

03:53:28.348 --> 03:53:34.336
TRAVIS: I throw unconscious guy and Sir Dead.

03:53:34.336 --> 03:53:36.119
MARISHA: Hope you guys were ready to get out.

03:53:36.119 --> 03:53:38.436
LAURA: I open up a bottle of wine and take a giant
swig.

03:53:38.436 --> 03:53:41.950
MATT: Okay. As you guys head back down to the
cellar?

03:53:41.950 --> 03:53:43.819
LAURA: Yeah.

03:53:43.819 --> 03:53:47.070
MATT: You guys all head back down to the cellar.
You throw them both out the window, including the body

03:53:47.246 --> 03:53:50.580
of Sir Kerrion (boof) out into the yard. You head
back down into the cellar.

03:53:50.658 --> 03:53:56.980
MARISHA: I cast Flaming Sphere, and I start moving
it around on the roof and start drawing the shape

03:53:56.980 --> 03:53:59.311
of the de Rolo family crest on the roof.

03:53:59.311 --> 03:54:10.825
MATT: Okay. It will take you a few minutes. You
now see, as you're finishing the symbol, Vouk

03:54:10.825 --> 03:54:18.062
running to the front of the building, and you hear
the voices of two guards going, "Master Vouk? What

03:54:18.062 --> 03:54:24.671
"happened? Tell us. Unbind him!" "Yes, sir." And
the two guards at the front of the building are

03:54:24.671 --> 03:54:26.862
talking with him. You finish the symbol.

03:54:26.862 --> 03:54:33.007
MARISHA: And I take my Flaming Sphere, and I throw
it right at the feet of where the guards are.

03:54:33.007 --> 03:54:36.844
MATT: Okay. You're on the roof, so you don't see
them, but you know they're off to the side of the

03:54:36.844 --> 03:54:41.967
roof, so you can roll it off the roof down to
them. They both freak out and react and seem to

03:54:41.967 --> 03:54:47.525
get into a defensive position. They start arming
themselves, and you hear crossbow bolts being set

03:54:47.525 --> 03:54:48.629
into place.

03:54:48.629 --> 03:54:53.831
MARISHA: I run over to the edge where the cellar
was, and I go, (whispering) Grog. Grog!

03:54:53.831 --> 03:54:54.874
TRAVIS: What?

03:54:54.874 --> 03:54:56.498
MARISHA: (whispering) Come to the side of the
roof!

03:54:56.498 --> 03:54:59.575
MATT: You guys make your ways back down through
the cellar, where Trinket's waiting patiently.

03:54:59.575 --> 03:55:00.898
(bear grunts)

03:55:00.898 --> 03:55:02.391
LAURA: Hey, buddy. Let's go.

03:55:02.391 --> 03:55:03.898
TRAVIS: Hi, Trinket. Get out.

03:55:03.898 --> 03:55:05.440
MATT: You guys come out of the cellar now.

03:55:05.440 --> 03:55:07.247
MARISHA: (whispering) Grog! Hey!

03:55:07.247 --> 03:55:08.436
TRAVIS: What?

03:55:08.436 --> 03:55:09.409
MARISHA: (whispering) Catch me!

03:55:09.409 --> 03:55:10.582
TRAVIS: Okay!

03:55:10.582 --> 03:55:16.920
MATT: Catch Keyleth. You guys are now out in the
open, still during the day, rain pouring down.

03:55:16.920 --> 03:55:20.076
LAURA: Running toward the woods? Where are we
running?

03:55:20.076 --> 03:55:21.389
MARISHA: Get the fuck out of here.

03:55:21.389 --> 03:55:25.010
TALIESIN: Let's head back to the inn. Let's try
the barracks. We'll try the barracks.

03:55:25.010 --> 03:55:26.434
MATT: The barracks are attached to the castle.

03:55:26.434 --> 03:55:27.294
TALIESIN: Shit. Okay.

03:55:27.294 --> 03:55:28.669
SAM: Back to the tavern, then.

03:55:28.669 --> 03:55:29.830
TALIESIN: Back to the tavern for now.

03:55:29.830 --> 03:55:31.029
LAURA: They're going to notice--

03:55:31.029 --> 03:55:32.229
MATT: Stealth check real fast, guys.

03:55:32.229 --> 03:55:35.232
MARISHA: I was going to say, do you have Pass
Without a Trace, can you summon any more spells?

03:55:35.232 --> 03:55:36.817
LAURA: I don't. I mean, I can cast it right now.

03:55:36.817 --> 03:55:38.868
MATT: If you want to quickly, yeah.

03:55:38.868 --> 03:55:40.506
MARISHA: Yeah, before we move.

03:55:40.506 --> 03:55:45.423
MATT: Stealth checks?

03:55:45.423 --> 03:55:46.478
SAM: 19.

03:55:46.478 --> 03:55:47.988
LIAM: Did we get the Pass Without a Trace?

03:55:47.988 --> 03:55:48.889
LAURA: Yeah.

03:55:48.889 --> 03:55:50.394
LIAM: So, plus ten, right?

03:55:50.394 --> 03:55:51.146
MATT: Yeah.

03:55:51.146 --> 03:55:52.043
LIAM: 34.

03:55:52.043 --> 03:55:52.730
TALIESIN: 20.

03:55:52.730 --> 03:55:53.197
MARISHA: 25.

03:55:53.197 --> 03:55:54.005
TRAVIS: 21.

03:55:54.005 --> 03:55:54.900
LAURA: 24.

03:55:54.900 --> 03:55:58.930
MATT: Sure enough, both guards rush around the
corner. You guys have already leapt over the

03:55:58.930 --> 03:56:02.648
fence. However, they see the fence. "The fence is
bent!" And they go rushing toward that direction.

03:56:02.648 --> 03:56:06.795
You guys have already disappeared into the various
alleyways, making your way back towards the inn in

03:56:06.795 --> 03:56:08.006
the center of town.

03:56:08.006 --> 03:56:09.790
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace, I mean, Dust of
Tracelessness.

03:56:09.790 --> 03:56:11.997
TRAVIS: Okay, yeah, just throwing it down behind
us.

03:56:11.997 --> 03:56:16.968
MATT: Okay. They're giving chase. They're hearing
the sounds of your footsteps a little, but

03:56:16.968 --> 03:56:23.381
eventually their sounds fade. You do hear in the
distance a bell start going off.

03:56:23.437 --> 03:56:26.516
TALIESIN: We're going to go into the basement.

03:56:26.516 --> 03:56:29.860
MATT: You start seeing people emerging from their
homes, hearing the bell. And, you would know this,

03:56:29.860 --> 03:56:35.438
this would be a warning bell for whenever a fire
breaks out in the city. You see smoke beginning to

03:56:35.438 --> 03:56:43.804
rise up, even through the rainstorm. The fire is
fighting the rain. But the smoke is black and

03:56:43.871 --> 03:56:48.977
it's starting to fade. You gather the building
itself did not catch fire enough to burn into

03:56:48.977 --> 03:56:53.699
rubble due to the rain, but you've probably left a
very visible mark on the roof.

03:56:53.699 --> 03:56:55.902
TALIESIN: That'll do.

03:56:55.902 --> 03:57:00.195
MATT: People begin to gather from the outside, and
you see folks running past the alley as you make

03:57:00.195 --> 03:57:03.993
your way back to the tavern that you currently
have as your base of operations. You all make your

03:57:03.994 --> 03:57:12.198
way in safely from the rain. Take a deep breath
and come to understand that you've definitely

03:57:12.198 --> 03:57:17.873
started the motion of whatever it is you're
intending to do. We'll see how it plays out in the

03:57:17.940 --> 03:57:21.070
near future. We'll call the session there for the
night.

03:57:21.157 --> 03:57:23.315
TRAVIS: Shit got hairy.

03:57:23.315 --> 03:57:25.291
TALIESIN: That was amazing.

03:57:25.291 --> 03:57:28.499
LAURA: That was dark, you guys. Super dark.

03:57:28.499 --> 03:57:29.974
SAM: I found seven gold.

03:57:29.974 --> 03:57:31.914
TALIESIN: I have a sword, now.

03:57:31.914 --> 03:57:36.932
TRAVIS: It's October.

03:57:36.932 --> 03:57:41.089
MARISHA: Speaking of Percy and his crazy storyline--

03:57:41.089 --> 03:57:42.736
TALIESIN: So that's about to happen, yeah.

03:57:42.736 --> 03:57:47.983
MARISHA: I'm guessing by now if you go on the Geek
and Sundry website, you can find his playlist.

03:57:47.983 --> 03:57:54.177
TALIESIN: Music to burn a house to. Music to violently
murder people to.

03:57:54.177 --> 03:57:57.713
MARISHA: I was gonna say, music to murder to.
Go check it out, it's great.

03:57:57.713 --> 03:58:01.994
TALIESIN: Music for a midnight murder. There we
are. Actually, I have some art that I would

03:58:01.994 --> 03:58:03.545
love to-- can I put on the--

03:58:03.545 --> 03:58:05.140
MATT: Yeah, sure.

03:58:05.140 --> 03:58:06.925
MARISHA: Taliesin art.

03:58:06.925 --> 03:58:11.177
TALIESIN: Yeah, I drew pictures. Just in case everybody
wants to see, this is the terrible thing

03:58:11.177 --> 03:58:13.727
we keep carving into people and things.

03:58:13.727 --> 03:58:15.183
MARISHA: Or burning on rooftops.

03:58:15.183 --> 03:58:21.589
TALIESIN: And then this is actually the de Rolo family
crest. Just another fancy thing.

03:58:21.589 --> 03:58:27.308
MATT: Very, very cool, and well done, sir.

03:58:27.308 --> 03:58:33.244
TALIESIN: Thank you. I drew a picture. So that shit
happened.

03:58:33.244 --> 03:58:38.155
MARISHA: Glad I'm not the only one who thinks
you're crazy anymore.

03:58:38.155 --> 03:58:40.374
TALIESIN: I think I'm crazy now. It's gonna
be interesting.

03:58:40.374 --> 03:58:46.242
MARISHA: You're all crazy, we've all seen it.
Now we can handle it as a family.

03:58:46.242 --> 03:58:47.922
ZAC: Yeah, y'all's fucked up.

03:58:47.922 --> 03:58:50.275
TALIESIN: That got way darker than I was expecting.

03:58:50.275 --> 03:58:55.796
ZAC: Yeah. I'm sure that won't have any negative
repercussions whatsoever.

03:58:55.796 --> 03:58:57.008
MATT: No.

03:58:57.008 --> 03:58:59.221
TALIESIN: I hate you, Matt.

03:58:59.221 --> 03:59:02.410
LAURA: Hey, man. Did we hit 10k?

03:59:02.410 --> 03:59:03.292
ZAC: Yep.

03:59:03.292 --> 03:59:05.735
(cheering)

03:59:05.735 --> 03:59:11.680
ZAC: 10,060. Currently Starburns is winning.

03:59:11.680 --> 03:59:17.110
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Starburns! Do it!

03:59:17.110 --> 03:59:21.805
ZAC: Here's what they forget: Jess and Steph are
the ones doing it. If anyone's watched Jess

03:59:21.805 --> 03:59:30.167
and Steph's craft show, it will most likely end up
being just a shaved face. If you think Jess and

03:59:30.167 --> 03:59:36.767
Steph can pull off Starburns, you're lying to
yourself, and it will just end up being a clean shave.

03:59:36.767 --> 03:59:40.412
TALIESIN: I got a straight razor, we could go for
this. You trust me, I mean, you know.

03:59:40.412 --> 03:59:42.651
I can get in there.

03:59:42.651 --> 03:59:43.987
ZAC: Moving on.

03:59:43.987 --> 03:59:45.737
TALIESIN: I can Sweeney Todd that.

03:59:45.737 --> 03:59:51.754
ZAC: Okay, so. Tonight, guys, we're just gonna be
reading off the names and we're gonna

03:59:51.754 --> 03:59:53.682
knock through 'em pretty quick.

03:59:53.682 --> 04:00:01.596
MATT: We're trying to keep time down for weeknights.
All right, guys, so we have donating tonight to

04:00:01.596 --> 04:00:10.847
Extra Live, we have Connor Brown, Steven Sudeban Davis,
Ravi Persuad, Mitchell DeFow-- sorry if I ruin

04:00:10.847 --> 04:00:18.517
any of these names, guys, by the way-- Tom Revely, Caleb
Popum, Michael Holloway, George Rinn,

04:00:18.517 --> 04:00:35.515
PumpkinSpiceThisBitchTheFourth, Anonymous Donator,
we have Patrick Toro, the Lost Tigers, Rebecca Case,

04:00:35.515 --> 04:00:48.494
Lewis Letter, Emma returns, Emma Engquist, I hope
I'm not ruining that too bad, Pernil Ilfsen-- that's

04:00:48.494 --> 04:00:55.599
a cool name-- Arthur Gibbs, another wonderful anonymous
donator, Maxine Poloquin, another great anonymous

04:00:55.599 --> 04:01:06.137
donator, Christian Huntlee, James Bell, John Reap, Killer
Penguin, Monica Dahl, Kayla Ernest, Tim Pearson,

04:01:06.137 --> 04:01:10.863
another great anonymous donator, PumpkinSpiceThisBitch
twice more--

04:01:10.863 --> 04:01:13.964
ZAC: Well, one's the original and one's the second.

04:01:13.964 --> 04:01:19.174
MATT: Oh, it carried over, I see. I see. The original 
and the second. There's a third one in there, probably.

04:01:19.174 --> 04:01:24.041
Guys, thank you so much. It's really incredible, each
one of you that donated to help Extra Life.

04:01:24.041 --> 04:01:25.223
We really appreciate it.

04:01:25.223 --> 04:01:33.191
ZAC: Since this weekend is the 24-hour Nerdist Extra
Life stream, starting next week we'll go back to 826LA

04:01:33.191 --> 04:01:35.942
and get those donations rolling back in for 826--

04:01:35.942 --> 04:01:43.686
MARISHA: But in the meantime, don't forget to go to
LA2050 and vote for 826LA so they can win 100k.

04:01:43.686 --> 04:01:51.283
ZAC: I would also like to throw out there the other--
it currently looks like it's a race between Starburns,

04:01:51.283 --> 04:01:53.822
Freddie Mercury, and Fu Manchu.

04:01:53.822 --> 04:01:55.850
LAURA: Oh, I like Freddie Mercury.

04:01:55.850 --> 04:01:58.692
TALIESIN: Starburns' really kinda rocking it for me.

04:01:58.692 --> 04:02:03.153
MARISHA: I was gonna suggest-- we had the Hunger Games
reference, so what was his name? Kerrion or whatever?

04:02:03.153 --> 04:02:05.076
The Gamemaster in the first one?

04:02:05.076 --> 04:02:08.408
ZAC: There is no way Steph and Jess have the ability
to do something like that.

04:02:08.408 --> 04:02:16.736
MATT: I almost wanna see the tristache. Tristache is
when you shave the handlebar, and then a smaller

04:02:16.736 --> 04:02:18.132
handlebar, and then a smaller--

04:02:18.132 --> 04:02:20.675
(laughter)

04:02:20.675 --> 04:02:22.873
ZAC: Poll's out. The poll's out, dude.

04:02:22.873 --> 04:02:25.491
SAM: Is the Hitler on the poll at all?

04:02:25.491 --> 04:02:27.776
(groaning)

04:02:27.776 --> 04:02:31.079
TALIESIN: You're a terrible person! That is the
worst thing I've heard yet.

04:02:31.079 --> 04:02:32.746
SAM: The Charlie Chaplin.

04:02:32.746 --> 04:02:41.359
ZAC: We also have a video to show you guys from a
community member about their own D&amp;amp;D Extra

04:02:41.359 --> 04:02:45.909
Life stream they're doing this weekend, so we are
going to show that to you guys here once you

04:02:45.909 --> 04:02:47.328
guys sign off, so.

04:02:47.328 --> 04:02:48.551
MATT: Fantastic, thank you so much.

04:02:48.551 --> 04:02:51.784
ZAC: Stick around tomorrow for Jess and Steph's 
birthday, where they cut my fucking face up.

04:02:51.784 --> 04:02:53.569
(cheering)

04:02:53.569 --> 04:02:57.522
MATT: That's gonna be worth its own weight in gold.
Well, all right, guys, we'll be back next week

04:02:57.522 --> 04:03:05.044
for our special Halloween episode of Critical Role.
We'll see how the story progresses darker and

04:03:05.102 --> 04:03:12.202
darker down this hole of horror and moral conundrum.
(laughs) I'm excited. I hope you are too.

04:03:12.202 --> 04:03:17.440
Once again, guys, thank you all so much. Our love to
the Team Hooman, Critter crowd out there, and

04:03:17.440 --> 04:03:21.065
is it Thursday yet? See you guys next week.

04:03:21.065 --> 04:03:23.337
TRAVIS: Damn straight!
