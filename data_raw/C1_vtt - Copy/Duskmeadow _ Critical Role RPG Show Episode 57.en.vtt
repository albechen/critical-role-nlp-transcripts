00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.990
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode 
of Critical Role,

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.000
where a bunch of us 
nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
battle traffic from E3 
to get here

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.490
in time to roll dice 
and play Dungeons and Dragons.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.000
TRAVIS: Yeah, we do.
SAM: Video games!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.790
MARISHA: All the video games.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.650
MATT: Thank you for being patient 
and waiting for us

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.000
with a couple of tech issues

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and generally battling
living in Los Angeles and having a car.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.990
Anyway, before we kick the night off, 
real fast,

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.000
I just want to take a moment 
to acknowledge--

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.500
and I feel 
it's important to acknowledge

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.700
there's been a lot of difficulty

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.510
and a lot of terrible things 
happening in the world

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.000
and in our country in particular 
this past week or so.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.930
And us as Critical Role 
and this community around,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.210
I'm sure many of you agree,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.000
we just wanted 
to take a moment to express

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that we stand with the families

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.370
of those that are currently dealing 
with this difficulty,

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.790
who have lost those,

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.000
and stand with the community
that this was aimed at.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.960
And everybody who has come together 
as part of this,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.000
we are in full support of this whole 
wonderful gathering of people

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
in light of this darkness,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and I think it's 
not just myself when I say

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.170
that everything 
this community stands for

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.000
is to perpetually spread love,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
community, positivity, 
acceptance,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and everything in between.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.580
So we just wanted 
to bring that to you guys

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.000
and let you know that we're thinking 
about you all out there.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And we have a wonderful community
of Critters out there as well.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.650
If anyone needs any help,
assistance, or guidance,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.030
or even just a happy word
to pick them up during this rough time,

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.450
we're all there for you.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.940
So, anyway. 
(blows kiss, sighs)

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.680
Then, to kick off this evening
of announcements and such,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.370
we are kicking into the second day

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.230
of our renewed 
Loot Crate sponsorship.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.920
(cheering)

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.710
MATT: We wanted to reinforce
that their current theme is Dystopia,

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.520
which is an awesome theme box
that deals with all sorts of things

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.900
of post-apocalypse and dystopian-type
films, games, the whole thing.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.160
They have Fallout, 
RoboCop, BioShock,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.450
a whole bunch 
of really, really cool things,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.000
so if you guys want to go 
to lootcrate.com/criticalrole,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
you can go ahead and get $3 off 
your subscription

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and get a whole bunch 
of that cool stuff.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.680
We also have the Dystopia DX,
which is their big collector's box--

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.540
TRAVIS: So awesome.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.000
MATT: which we showed last week.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
LAURA: Oh, is that 
what this one was from?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
MARISHA: Yeah, your sweet shirt.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.590
ASHLEY: I love that shirt.
LAURA: Yeah, Skeletor!

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.000
MATT: (laughs) That's pretty slick.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
If you guys have a chance 
to check it out,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
go see if it's 
something you'd be interested in,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and make sure you put in

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
the criticalrole-- all one word-- code

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
to go ahead and get 
your subscription discount,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
which is fantastic.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.670
MATT: We're happy to present that
(funny accent) and are happy

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.580
that they like our show enough 
to come and sponsor,

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.000
which is awesome.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.320
(normal voice) So check that out.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.010
You have until 
the 19th at 9pm Pacific

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.000
to subscribe 
and receive the Dystopia theme,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
otherwise it switches over 
to the next theme,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
so if you're gonna get 
under the wire for that one,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
(funny accent) do it soon.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
It's like a-- yeah! We have a--

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
TRAVIS: Weâ€™re giving out crates
in a chat room thing, don't we?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
MATT: You think so?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.680
TRAVIS: Yeah.
SAM: Giving out crates?

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.000
LAURA: We are?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
TALIESIN: Are we?
MARISHA: Are we?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.350
LAURA: (gasps) That's exciting!

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.070
ASHLEY: It's going to be one at the break?
It's going to be a giveaway at the break?

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.960
MATT: Oh, snap.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.260
ASHLEY: I'm just going 
to start making stuff up.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.000
TRAVIS: Is that-- 
did you just point and--

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
ASHLEY: Point, shoot.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.680
SAM: Loot Crate has donated
two Loot Crate DX boxes

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.680
to give away to you.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.000
We will be doing this at the break

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.360
and at the end of the night, 
random in chat.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.500
You must be active!

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.050
Stay tuned for that! 
Exclamation point!

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.000
MARISHA: I'm so glad 
someone wrote that down for us!

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.570
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm so glad

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.000
they wrote out 
the exclamation point.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
TRAVIS: I'm in the chat right now.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
LAURA: (laughing) Yeah.
TRAVIS: Totally.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
SAM: Remind you, gotta stay active.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
MARISHA: You're active? Stay active.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
MATT: Stay active, Travis.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
In the game! (snaps fingers) 
Eyes up here, Grog.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
(laughter)

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
MATT: All right, 
so the next couple of things

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
we want to mention 
to you guys real fast:

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
We have, it started up today,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.490
a Critical Role t-shirt contest 
that went up.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.000
LAURA: Yeah!

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
MATT: We're doing this with Woobox.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.760
The link should be in the chat room
for you guys to check out,

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.500
but we have currently,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.000
until June 24th at midnight, 
the cut-off date,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
but if anyone wants 
to submit any designs,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
all the rules for the contest 
are there.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
When all those designs 
have been submitted,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.790
we ourselves, 
the cast of Critical Role,

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.000
are going to pore through 
and pick our favorite.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.570
LAURA: Top three.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.000
MATT: Top three?
LAURA: Yes.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
TRAVIS: Top three faves.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.700
MATT: (funny accent) And we will have 
designs incoming forward

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.700
for official Critical Role 
shirt stuffs, which is nice.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.670
TRAVIS: (similar accent) Critter.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.000
LAURA: (similar accent) Critter, 
it's a Critter shirt.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
MARISHA: Critter shirt.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.500
TRAVIS: (similar accent) Critter 
community t-shirt.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.000
SAM: Are they all going to be like
Boaty McBoatface or something?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
(laughter)

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
LAURA: What's Boaty McBoatface?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
SAM: Boaty McBoatface is 
like an online "name our boat."

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.610
(all say Boaty McBoatface)

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.510
MATT: Say Boaty McBoatface 
so we can get into this,

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.800
and I'll be happy.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.000
(laughter)

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
TRAVIS: Do your worst.
Show us your best. Yes!

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.750
MARISHA: All right, 
who did we send to Alaska?

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.050
Who was that? Was that Flo Rida?

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.000
MATT: No. Oh, Alaska? That was...
Redman. Bulldog.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
MARISHA: Bulldog!

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
TALIESIN: Pitbull.
MARISHA: Pitbull! Pitbull!

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.890
MATT: I mess up his name 
intentionally all the time.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.000
TRAVIS: Bullman?
TALIESIN: (groans)

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.300
MARISHA: (laughing) Pitbull.
ASHLEY: Bulldog. Shih tzu.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.660
MARISHA: He played in, 
like, a Wal-Mart in Anchorage.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.400
LAURA: But it was like 
a joke for publicity, right?

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.000
MATT: He went ahead and did it!

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.350
The online poll 
for his next performance,

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.050
the internet trolled him and made it
to this far Alaska performance.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.820
MARISHA: A Wal-Mart in Anchorage,
or something like that.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.790
LAURA: And he did it

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.900
MATT: And he did it! I was like,
"respect to you, man. Well done."

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.760
MARISHA: Yeah, respect.
Like 50 people showed up.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.000
LAURA: That's awesome!
MARISHA: And got a private--

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
LAURA: Concert.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
TALIESIN: You know what,
I've done a con in Anchorage.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.620
It's nice. I like it.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.820
TRAVIS: Yeah, man. Anchorage moose.
TALIESIN: They've got moose.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.740
LAURA: Can we talk about our next thing
because I'm so excited about it.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.800
SAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: What's the next thing?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.000
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Do we get to show it, or no?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
LAURA: YES.
TALIESIN: Oh, yes, that!

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
LIAM: (frustrated noises)

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.480
LAURA: Wait, okay, 
so Liam gets to say it.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.000
MATT: So, you are technically DM.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
LIAM: So some of you 
might remember us

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
talking about Joe Madureira

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.030
and his Kickstarter game, 
Darksiders Night War,

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.000
which he successfully Kickstarted.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.360
We talked about it a bunch 
on this show--

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.000
MATT: Battle War, you mean?
LIAM: Hm?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
MATT: Darksiders was--

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
LIAM: Excuse me. Battle Chasers.
LAURA: Battle Chasers.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
LIAM: Excuse me, 
I was going to be here

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.500
for a half hour and settle down

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.000
and go over my talking points.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
LIAM: Battle Chasers.
SAM: You're wearing the shirt.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
LIAM: Battle Chasers. 
I'm wearing the damn shirt.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
(laughter)

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
LIAM: Sorry. 
Hour and a half in L.A. traffic.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Anyway.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.710
He successfully Kickstarted,
they're working on it,

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.000
I just saw him at E3,
I saw him a couple of days ago.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.500
If you don't know Joe's work,

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.850
he is a comic book artist rock star.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.270
He has worked on X-men,

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.000
he's worked on Avenging Spider-Man,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Inhumans, Ultimates 3,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and his own comic, Battle Chasers,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
which I fell in love with 
when I was a teenager.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.500
He does gorgeous artwork.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.000
He's only gotten better with time.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
SAM: Pitbull Chasers.
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
LIAM: Pitbull Chasers, Flo Rida,
and Joe collaborating together.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Anyway, that game's coming out.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
You should check it out, 
this is it.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
But I bring that up because
while Joe is a busy, busy guy,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
he somehow found the time-- 
I'm so excited--

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
to create an exclusive art piece 
for Critical Role.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
ASHLEY: Can we bring it in?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
MARISHA: So gorgeous.
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
(noises of awe)

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.500
LIAM: Look at that business. 
So right now--

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.050
LAURA: It's blocking my face, 
but I want to see it.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.000
MARISHA: Well, we've seen it tiny.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
LIAM: Guys, if you go over 
to the Geek and Sundry shop

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
right now,
this is on pre-order, so--

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.500
I'm going over my script--

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.000
signed versions of this

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.630
will be available for pre-order 
for 2 weeks only.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.740
TRAVIS: Yeah, limited 2-week run, y'all.
Get it.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.970
LIAM: 2-week pre-order.
And then unsigned for 3 weeks.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.000
LAURA: 3 weeks.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.050
LIAM: So this is now or never.
ASHLEY: It's so badass!

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.000
MARISHA: Now or never
and then it goes away forever.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
LAURA: Forever!

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
LIAM: And it's too gorgeous, too. 
Oh my lord.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
MARISHA: It's so gorgeous.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
ASHLEY: I wonder if we should show
a close-up or something.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.590
LAURA: So yeah, keep in mind
when you order it on pre-order

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.000
that you have to wait
for it to be fully pre-ordered

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.466
before we can send it out.

00:07:53.466 --> 00:07:57.050
I don't know if that was on camera
because I'm above the poster.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.500
(laughter)

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.000
ASHLEY: It's so sexy.
MARISHA: You're so sexy.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.500
LIAM: It's all right. 
Vex is on the paper, so.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.000
LAURA: That's right.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
MARISHA: Pike in that 
three-point landing!

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.500
LAURA: Oh no, don't take it away.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.000
ASHLEY: (singing) Goodbye, my love!

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
TRAVIS: There's an image 
on the website, right?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.500
MARISHA: And they are 
movie-poster size.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.000
They are that size.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.230
LAURA: Yeah, they're that full-on--

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.500
LIAM: They're 24 x 36. Gorgeous.
MARISHA: 24 x 36.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.000
SAM: And there's a place to click

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.500
on the page where you are
right now watching this.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.180
MATT: Those are my eyes. 
I'm on a poster!

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.780
MARISHA: If you scroll down, 
there'll be a button.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.000
LIAM: Scroll down 
to the bottom of the page,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
there's a button for that.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
MARISHA: Scroll down, 
there's a button.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
LIAM: Thank you, Joe. 
Thank you. It's gorgeous.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.500
LAURA AND MARISHA: Thank you, Joe!
MATT: Thank you, Joe. It's amazing.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.500
ASHLEY: Thanks, Joe!
TALIESIN: That's amazing.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.000
LAURA: It's beautiful.
ASHLEY: I love it so much.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.840
MATT: It is getting framed
and becoming a centerpiece of our home.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.000
LIAM: And Battle Chasers Night War.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
You should check it out today.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
(laughter)

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
MATT: All righty.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.550
SAM: Signed, by the way, 
signed by us, not by the artist.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.000
LIAM: Us. By us.
MARISHA: Yeah, by us.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.790
TALIESIN: You could find him.
Hunt him down if you wanted to.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.800
MARISHA: Yes. (laughs)

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.000
MATT: (in a funny accent) 
Taliesin, you are going to be

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.430
somewhere this weekend, 
are you not?

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.010
TALIESIN: Oh, god, I am.
As soon as we're done here,

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.000
I go home and pack 
and get on an airplane.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I will be at Amazing Comic Con
in Vegas all weekend.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
TRAVIS: You bastard.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.500
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
Sleep is never gonna happen.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.000
LAURA, ASHLEY, AND MARISHA: No.
TALIESIN: Never.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
ASHLEY: What is that.
TRAVIS: Sleep.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
TALIESIN: You can meet me, 
slightly deranged,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
all weekend at Amazing Comic Con

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.500
with a bunch of other 
Street Fighter kids,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.000
and it's going to be a great time,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.500
and be right next to the Library Bards.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.000
Bonnie Gordon, yeah yeah.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
MATT: Yes, yes.
TALIESIN: Yeah, be hanging with them.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, Library Bards. Nice.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
MATT: Glorious.
TALIESIN: Good times.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.500
MATT: And if I recall,

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.000
there was also 
a recent announcement

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
of a cool Telltale game 
that went up this week.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.060
LAURA: Oh, man! 
Batman the Telltale series!

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.000
TRAVIS: It's sweet.
They announced the Batman cast

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and Laura is playing 
Catwoman Selina Kyle.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, man.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
TRAVIS: I play District Attorney

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.880
LAURA AND TRAVIS: Harvey Dent.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.320
ASHLEY: Ohhh.
LAURA: It's pretty exciting.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.000
TRAVIS: We're gonna 
turn Gotham around.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
LAURA: And at E3 today,
we went and checked out the demo

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and it's pretty frickin' cool.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
ASHLEY: It's so good.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I saw it yesterday and today

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
because I just couldn't not 
watch it again.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
TRAVIS: It's gonna be fun.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
MATT: All righty,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
anyone else have anything
they want to talk about?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
(southern drawl) Or shall we dive into

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
the rest of tonight's story?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
TRAVIS: Let's dive into the story.
MARISHA: Let's dive.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
MATT: (southern drawl) All righty.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Let's go ahead and bring it down

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
as we all prepare ourselves 
to begin to kick off

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
(spooky ethereal music)

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
(heavy breathing)

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
(roaring)

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:42.000
(dramatic music)

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
(gun firing)

00:10:47.000 --> 00:11:41.000
(dramatic music)

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
(crackling flames)

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
MATT: Welcome back.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.050
So, picking up 
where we last left off last week.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:56.050
Vox Machina,
the growing troop of heroic misfits,

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.950
having recently felled

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.000
their first recent member
of the Chroma Conclave,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Umbrasyl the Hope Devourer,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
as well as destroying

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
the current incursion
of the Herd of Storms

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
in the city of Westruun.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
You met with 
the remaining people of the town

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.170
and began to decide a plan 
for its continued existence

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.990
and the recovery of those
that were displaced

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.000
in these recent conflicts.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Part of this process was meeting
an individual named Kerrek,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.030
who was a blacksmith
who had been in the town for a while,

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.000
who unwittingly 
became part of this discussion--

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.270
MARISHA: My best friend.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.000
MATT: (laughs)

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.020
Grog had spoken with 
the remnants of the Herd of Storms

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.000
that had essentially 
been disbanding from the name

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.160
and moving west 
to join with the Rivermaw,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.000
which had stepped off 
from the herd not too long ago.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
You guys had a hot springs episode 
in the mansion.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
SAM: (laughs)

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.690
MATT: Scanlan, 
you had made your way back to Kymal,

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:01.980
in which you, along with the aid 
of a few of your friends,

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.710
figured out a plan in which the people 
who had been displaced

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.000
could eventually return to Westruun,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.530
and also found Kaylie 
and spoke with her,

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:15.100
had your somewhat-tearful 
reunion there.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.910
You guys began to construct
a subterranean portion of Westruun

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.000
that would be protected
from future dragon incursion,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.100
renovating and restructuring

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.240
within the sewer system 
beneath the city.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.710
After this process was complete,

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.000
you decided the next level 
of your trek,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
the next direction you would travel

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.030
would be towards the far western,
northwestern continent of Othanzia.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.020
Specifically, the city of Vasselheim
that you all know so well.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:45.880
All of you guys stepping through
a tree portal presented by Keyleth,

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.720
you immediately step out 
into the snowy exterior

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.310
of what seems like the outside
of the Quad Roads in Vasselheim.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:58.000
And now, we see what 
your next plan of action is.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.090
What do you guys want to do?

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.000
SAM: (sighs) Light a fire.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
LAURA: What time is it? (laughs)

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
MARISHA: Yeah, what time is it?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.580
MATT: It's hard to tell right now
with the cloud cover so thick in the sky,

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.580
but you envision at this point in time,

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.550
it's probably mid-afternoon or so.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.350
The general omniscient glow 
through the clouds,

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.670
kind of diffused light,

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.010
but based on the time that you--

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:25.000
where you were 
and how far you traveled,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.230
you gather it's probably 
early to mid-afternoon.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
SAM: Well, you're the one 
who brought us here, Vax.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.030
Where would you like to go?

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.630
LIAM: I need to go 
to the temple of the Raven Queen.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.000
SAM: We'll come with you.
LAURA: Let's go.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
TALIESIN: I know where that is.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.500
LIAM: I know that you all 
have a lot of errands to do.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.500
I don't need everyone to come.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.000
TRAVIS: We have a lot of errands to do?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
LIAM: I thought so. You mentioned...

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
LAURA: My only errand 
is to keep my eyes on you.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.670
TALIESIN: I have some errands,
if that makes anybody feel better.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.000
I have some errands to run.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.020
TRAVIS: Do you need any help
with your errands?

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.200
TALIESIN: Sure. Actually, yes.
I would love some help with my errands.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.000
LAURA: Don't let him shop, Percy.
Do not let him shop.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.260
TALIESIN: That shouldn't be a problem.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.030
TRAVIS: I don't know what that means,
but I'm sure I take great offense.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.000
LAURA: (laughs)

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
TALIESIN: You're getting smarter.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.550
TRAVIS: How effin' dare you.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.760
LAURA: That eagle form 
really made a difference.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.760
TRAVIS: I spit out a feather. 
(pthh)

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
MATT: So. Who's off to where?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.070
LAURA: Where is this 
Raven Queen's temple?

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.750
LIAM: (sighs) 
We've not been here many times.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.170
Are we surrounded by people?

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:33.560
Are there people walking about?

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.930
MATT: It is quite a busy time 
in the afternoon.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.610
There is actually a bit 
of hustle and bustle.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:40.080
Looking around,

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.000
just a quick glance 
at your vicinity in Vasselheim,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
you can see a lot of the bastions 
are out in force.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.590
Many of them are in process 
of helping construct

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.960
what looks like 
reinforced dragon-headed ballistae.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.040
Some of the ones you had seen
towards the outside walls of the city.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.000
There are more being installed
upon the inner walls,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and the ones in the distance

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
appear to be
under some form of construction.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.350
TALIESIN: We have rooms.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.000
Why don't we go claim our rooms

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
and I'm sure they can lead us
to everywhere we need to go.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
LIAM: That makes sense.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.500
MARISHA: Want to go check in
at the Slayer's Take?

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.000
TALIESIN: And we can meet back there
when everything is done.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
MARISHA: All right.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
LAURA: Do you need 
to check in at your temple,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.500
or should we pretend 
you're not here

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.320
so they don't try 
to make you stay?

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.000
ASHLEY: Let's just pretend 
for a little bit.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.530
ASHLEY: And then I'll check in later.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.000
There's no rush to get there.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.750
At least, that I know of right now.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:30.000
SAM: God will wait 
for a long time.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
TRAVIS: All right. 
To the Slayer's Take, then?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
LAURA: Let's do it.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
TALIESIN: To the Slayer's Take.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.040
MATT: All right. You guys continue 
further south into the Quad Roads

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.010
until eventually you find yourselves
at the Slayer's Take guildhall.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:41.280
The door is partially ajar already.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.000
It appears that somebody 
had left it open,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
but it is warm on the inside.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.500
You can see a fireplace hearth

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.000
on the far back and to the right

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
is already kind of filling the area

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
with this subtle musty smoke smell,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and the crackling of wood 
in the distance

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
is a very welcoming sensation

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
from the cold exterior 
of the city streets.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
As you enter,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.550
you do not see anybody
at the front desk at the moment,

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.732
but you do see a few other
random individuals of the guild

00:17:07.732 --> 00:17:09.175
that have taken certain tables.

00:17:09.175 --> 00:17:10.566
Some are eating, 
and some are in the process

00:17:10.566 --> 00:17:12.740
of playing cards or passing the time.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.990
It seems to be 
a relatively casual day

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:16.990
here at the Slayer's Take.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:21.900
But your rooms are still available,
best as you need.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.460
Anything you specifically require 
in this place?

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.400
LAURA: Can I grab one of the people 
that are here and ask him,

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.000
What's all 
the hustle about outside?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
I see them installing more.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.540
MATT: Okay. You go ahead and--

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.000
one of the guys closest to you,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
you've met him briefly in passing,
his name is Loran.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
He has a completely bald head

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
with a single stripe tattoo 
down the center.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
He has a very, very pointed long chin.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Human, but he's probably
been busted in the face a few times.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
You can see there's just scars

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
and what appears to be bone structure

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
that may have been reformed at times
due to blunt trauma.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
But he's just sitting there,
sharpening his weapons,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.020
just kind of doing good upon his own self,
being prepared for anything.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.500
But as you come over 
to ask him the question,

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.000
he looks up to you and goes,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
"Word's gone 
around the town recently

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
"that there's some wandering 
dragon horde

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
"tearing through Tal'Dorei,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
"so they're just upping security 
around these places, just in case."

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
LAURA: Smart.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.330
MATT: "I hope so. 
Hope they make their way here."

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.000
LAURA: Nobody's sighted the dragons, 
though, over here?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
MATT: "Not to my knowledge, but

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
"(chuckles) I'd love to get my hand 
on some of them scales."

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
(blade scrapes)

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
MARISHA: What's your name?

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.160
MATT: "Loran."

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.500
MARISHA and SAM: What?

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:47.000
MARISHA: Oran? What?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.050
MATT: "Loran."

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.000
MARISHA: Loran.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
MATT: Because... that's what I remember.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.680
LIAM: Thought so.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.200
(laughter)

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.000
LIAM: It took over 50 episodes 
for that to happen.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.000
LAURA: I'm sorry, 
what was the question?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.500
MATT: Well, when you don't take notes

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.980
when I give you 
a character's name originally,

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.860
and they come back around 
and it's weird

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.970
when you suddenly take damage
and your character starts hemorrhaging.

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.580
LAURA: Oh no. Loran.
Loran was his name.

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.670
LIAM: I was just eating an apple.
Why am I dying?

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:21.980
MATT: (laughs)

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.340
TRAVIS: Veiled threat.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.150
ASHLEY: I'm just sitting by the fire, so.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.520
LAURA: Slayer's Take.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.700
MARISHA: So we have seen 
this guy before?

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.000
MATT: Some of you 
may have seen him in passing.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.890
You haven't really 
had a conversation with him.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:34.000
He just exists within the guild.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
There's many members
that you've come across in the past.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.500
MARISHA: Sure, that exist.
TRAVIS: Probably a dragon.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.000
LAURA: Pointy chin. Got it.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
ASHLEY: Stripe on his head.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
TRAVIS: Nothing wrong with those.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.440
LIAM: How are the people doing?

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.730
Is there a sense of worry,
or do you guys feel pretty secure?

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.000
MATT: "As far as this town is concerned,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
"it takes a lot more than a couple dragons
to drop these walls.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.900
"It's the reason it's been around 
for a long time,

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.690
"and I'd like to see them try."

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:03.000
MARISHA: Have you ever
encountered a dragon personally, Loran?

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
MATT: "I mean, I've come across
a few small ilk in my days."

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Sure. Yeah. Yep.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
SAM: (laughs) Are you hazing Loran?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.910
MARISHA: Nope.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.500
LAURA: Keyleth is proud of herself

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.000
because we've just killed our third,
actually.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
MATT: "Oh, that's fantastic. 
I love to hear it.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
"You half-elves are a humble bunch."

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.430
(laughter)

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:30.120
TRAVIS: Fire! Put the flames out!

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.000
MARISHA: Yeah, Team Half-Elf. Yeah!

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
TRAVIS: Such a good burn.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
LAURA: Liam, I don't want 
to ask Matt this,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.050
but the chick 
that runs the Slayer's Take,

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:42.000
her name's Vanessa?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
ALL: Vanessa.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
SAM: Cyndrian.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
LIAM: And her husband Merkin.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
SAM: Mertin.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
MATT: (laughs)

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
LAURA: Are Vanessa 
and Merkin around?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
SAM: Mertin.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
LAURA: Mertin.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.760
SAM: Merkin is a different thing.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.480
MATT: (laughs) Yeah, 
a very different thing.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.168
I guess it depends on 
if he shaved recently.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.820
He looks toward the back room,
where her main office is, and he goes,

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.860
"You're welcome to go ahead
and knock on the door

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.570
"if you're feeling frisky."

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:09.530
LAURA: Should we try to sell Vanessa
some of our dragon bits?

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.000
TRAVIS: We should sell to a merchant?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.620
LAURA: Well, they tend to be in the--

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.000
TALIESIN: They may have a buyer.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.500
TRAVIS: Love that you 
asked me that question.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.000
LAURA: I know, right?
What was I thinking?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
TRAVIS: I don't know. (laughs)

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.500
TALIESIN: Keep a few of the scales, obviously.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.000
TRAVIS: We can tell 
what my place in the party is.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.500
LAURA: Of course. Grog, come with me.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.000
MARISHA: Oh, wait, keep the teeth.
Keep enough teeth for us.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
TALIESIN: We'll talk 
about the cold bag for now

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
and see if there's anything else
they want to talk about.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
MARISHA: I have an idea for teeth.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
LAURA: Can I go find Vanessa?

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
MATT: You go 
and knock on the door. (knocks)

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
There's a brief pause. 
Knock again. (knocks)

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.400
LAURA: (sing-song) Vanessa?
Vox Machina here-- oh, hi.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.000
MATT: The door (whoosh) swings open.
You have to duck backwards.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
It (thump) slams onto
the other side of the wall there,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
knocking a few knick-knacks
that were on a nearby shelf over.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And Vanessa swings out.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
"What? Who's calling-- ah.
It has been some time.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
"How nice of you to come and visit.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
"May I... be of service to you?"

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
LAURA: Oh, well, we were wondering
if we could be of service to you.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.410
We happen to have acquired
a great many dragon bits

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:14.000
and we thought you might be in need of

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
buying them for your sellers-- buyers.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Your people.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
SAM: Fencing them.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
LAURA: Fence-- you know.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
TALIESIN: I really thought 
you'd be better at this.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
MATT: "There is no fencing."

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.610
LAURA: No fencing, no. No, you're--

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.000
MATT: "We run a legitimate business."

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
LAURA: Legal buyers.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
MATT: "Good. 
As was I hoping to hear this.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.730
"Let me check my ledger."

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:32.000
She turns around 
and goes back to her desk.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.040
Her tail flicks behind her as she steps 
over to her table, leans over.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.000
"(muttering) Ah!"

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.290
Pulls one of the books. (blows)
Starts thumbing through it.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:45.000
(mutters) "What color dragon?"

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
LAURA: Black.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
MATT: "Chromatic."

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.290
SAM: (quietly) Ancient.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.740
LAURA: Ancient black dragon.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:58.000
MARISHA: Yeah, you might have heard 
about him. Umbrasyl... (chuckles)

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:04.000
SAM: You're super salty today.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.710
TRAVIS: Tone it down two notches.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:10.936
MATT: "There is currently
no contract for a black dragon.

00:23:10.936 --> 00:23:17.064
"I do have one up for a bronze 
or perhaps a white, but..."

00:23:17.064 --> 00:23:19.460
LAURA: Oh, white! 
Do we have any white bits left?

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.750
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.000
ASHLEY: We should have white 
from back in the day.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
LAURA: What, do you want scales or...

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
MATT: "Specifically hide.
If there is white dragonhide?"

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
TRAVIS: We have 60 pounds of--

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
LAURA: That was the dragon
we killed for you before,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.190
because we didn't bring the--

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.500
TALIESIN: No, it was before that one.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.240
LAURA: No, but we killed one with Zahra.
We killed a white dragon.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.110
MATT: "That was 
for a different contract.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:40.000
"This is for a newer one I came by."

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
LAURA: We've killed four dragons?!
Four fucking dragons. Go us.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.460
MARISHA: Yes, we have. Yes.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.720
TRAVIS: Excuse us 
while we reminisce, apparently.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.770
MATT: "(deadpan) Yes, it is amazing.

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.730
"The things you've accomplished.
I am blown away.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:57.080
"But in light of your capabilities,

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.000
"I do not require anything black dragon.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
"However, if a contract comes in,
I know who to call.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.760
"Hold onto that,
because that would save you a trip."

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.960
LAURA and MARISHA: All right.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.110
TALIESIN: We do have
some white scales left over, don't we?

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.090
LAURA: Yes, I think so.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.610
TRAVIS: Yeah, we do.
We have 60 pounds of scales.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:11.000
MATT: "Is this hide or scales?"

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
TRAVIS: Just scales. 
No hide, unfortunately.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.010
MATT: "Well, I could definitely do

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.000
"a bit of business for you there.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.420
"The hide would fetch more, but--
60 pounds, you said?"

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.000
TRAVIS: Yeah. 64, to be exact.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.020
LAURA: Of white dragon scales.
MATT: "64 of white dragon scales, okay."

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:32.230
MATT: "I would be willing to continue
at least part of this contract

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:39.000
"for this applicant for...
let's say... 4,500 gold pieces."

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
LAURA: 5,000 gold pieces, 
I think is a fair price.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
MATT: "This is not about bartering.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
"This is what the contract says, my dear.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
"This is beyond 
a situation of conversation.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
"The paperwork is already signed."

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.230
LAURA: What if we gave you 
less dragon scales?

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:59.970
Would you have said less money?

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:03.000
SAM: That's typically how it works.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.400
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (laugh)

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:12.530
MATT: "Vex'ahlia. My dear.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:18.000
"My delightful little 
dragon-hating half-elf.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
"We've been good to you.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.070
"We've done many great things for you.
You've done great things for us.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:23.380
"This is a fantastic arrangement."

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.000
(thud) She slams the book shut 
and sets it down.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.490
"But you have signed on with us,

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:32.000
"and the deal is to fulfill contracts

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.500
"as they are signed, as they are written,

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.000
"as they are agreed upon by the person.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.500
"If you wish not to accept this contract,

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.910
"we can just wait 
until somebody else picks it up

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.490
"and goes out and fulfills this need

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.000
"at the price 
at which they are requesting for this.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
"You're welcome to keep the scales."

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
LAURA: I think we'll keep them

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
and we'll sell them to other vendors, then.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.940
SAM: Haven't we had them for years?

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.760
TALIESIN: I have a thing 
I'm thinking about.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.710
MATT: "See? Then it's easy 
for you to get rid of them.

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:55.440
"If they've been a problem for you,
then I'm sure this would be easy."

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.520
SAM: Where are we going to sell these?
The world's on fire!

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.000
MARISHA: Okay, hang on. 
We know it's here.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.770
There aren't that many
white dragons walking around--

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.230
TALIESIN: Certainly not anymore.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.000
MARISHA: Certainly not anymore.
We know it's here.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Why don't we sleep on it. 
Think about it.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
If we're ever in a pinch for money,
we can come back.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
TRAVIS: Yeah. Sounds good.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
LAURA: Vanessa, you're so kind.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.720
TRAVIS: Besides, I've been working
on that dragon immunity potion.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.340
LAURA: I'm so sorry.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.660
MATT: "That is all right. Goodbye."

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.770
And she shoos you out.

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.000
MARISHA: Oh, wait, Vanessa. Wait.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
MATT: "Yes, other female half-elf?"

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.420
MARISHA: That's me.
Where's the temple of the Raven Queen?

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:37.000
MATT: "Oh, you're looking for 
the Duskmeadow. Raven's Crest."

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.330
She points loosely outward,

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:43.460
kind of southeast of the direction
of the Slayer's Take guildhall.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.000
"It's kind of hard to miss.
It's giant, black, ominous.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.890
"(chuckles) You'll see it."

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.000
And she bops your nose
a little bit with her finger.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
"Now, please. Out of my office.
I have work to get done."

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.770
LAURA: Thank you, Vanessa.
MARISHA: Okay, bye.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.000
SAM: Thank you. 
Kord's strength to you.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.220
MATT: "That does nothing for me."

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.000
(slamming) Slams the door shut.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
LAURA: They were worth a lot more

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.500
than what she was offering, 
just for the record.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.500
They are worth so much more.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.000
SAM: To whom? 
We haven't ever sold them

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
or come across anyone 
who wanted them before.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
TALIESIN: This is no reason
to get rid of something for wholesale.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.516
LAURA: Well, we've not really tried.

00:27:10.516 --> 00:27:12.000
That doesn't mean 
we should just give them away.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.660
SAM: We also are almost full

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.520
in our Bag of Holding, 
might I remind you,

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.570
and 64 pounds
would free up quite some--

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.000
LAURA: It's not 64 pounds.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.350
SAM: It's 64 pounds.
TRAVIS: It's 64.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.560
LAURA: Oh, it was 64 pounds. (groans)
MATT: (laughs)

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.000
TRAVIS: Like I just told you.
ASHLEY: 64 pounds of scales.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.500
TRAVIS: But I could 
get rid of some other stuff.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.000
LAURA: Well, they're worth 
like 20,000 gold.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.500
SAM: To whom?

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.000
LAURA: You don't care.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
TRAVIS: We also have 15 cases
of expensive-ass bottles of wine.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
TALIESIN: I'm just going 
to point out, since--

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
LIAM, LAURA, AND MARISHA: 
We should drink those.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.500
TALIESIN: We should drink those, 
first of all.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.000
That is the only thing that makes sense.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
And I feel-- and I apologize
if it seems like I say this a lot,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.850
but I do have a castle
that we can drop things at,

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:56.000
and we can leave them there,
perhaps get back to them at a later date.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
MARISHA: To be fair, Percy, 
you do a lot to remind us

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
to try not to forget that you're titled.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
SAM: To be fair, have we ever

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
gone back for something before, ever,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.500
in our entire travels?

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.000
TALIESIN: Yes.
SAM: What?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
LIAM: We needn't stay here long.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
I don't think what I'm here for
is going to take too long.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.580
I hope.
We could go to Whitestone next.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:20.300
TALIESIN: Yes, drop everything off,

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:24.000
create a little nest of what we need.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
LAURA: All right. 
Let's go find your queen.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
TRAVIS: (quietly) 
There is some gross shit in this bag.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.650
(laughter)

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.000
TALIESIN: You found the troll dick, 
didn't you?

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
LAURA: What do you have in there?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
TRAVIS: There are six basilisk eggs.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
LAURA: Are they still good?
MARISHA: Those are probably bad.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
TALIESIN: Oh, I bet those
have gone really bad.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
TRAVIS: I reach into the Bag of Holding
and think about one basilisk egg.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
LIAM: I'm sure they smell like Grog.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
MATT: You pull out a basilisk egg.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
TALIESIN: Do they just turn to stone?

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
MATT: It's roughly that size.
It's a dull grayish-blue hint.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
LIAM: Sulfuric?
TRAVIS: Can I get the smell?

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.020
MATT: It has a somewhat, very vague 
sulfurous scent on the outside of the egg.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.000
TRAVIS: I'll put it back in the bag.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
ASHLEY: Oh, Vanessa!

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
LAURA: We could make stink-bombs with it.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
MARISHA AND TALIESIN: Ooh.
LIAM: Yeah, we could.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.500
MARISHA: Good idea. I like that.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.000
TRAVIS: All right. So what's next?

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
LAURA: We go see the Raven Queen.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
You go see the Raven Queen
and we wait outside.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.500
LIAM: I didn't say anything.
LAURA: Uselessly.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.000
LIAM: I didn't say anything!

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
TALIESIN: Is it in the direction 
where I have to go?

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
MATT: Where are you heading?

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.500
TALIESIN: I need to resupply everything.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.000
MATT: That's the opposite direction.
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
MATT: You're heading 
to the Braving Grounds.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
They're heading to the Duskmeadow.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
TRAVIS: Oh! I like the sound of that. 
I'll go with you.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
TALIESIN: Yes, you will.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
SAM: I'll come with you, as well.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.220
TRAVIS: Yeah, three! Who else?

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.000
Any other takers
while Vax goes and gets a tattoo?

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
MATT: (laughs)

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.550
LIAM: Another tattoo?

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:36.000
TRAVIS: Well, I thought that--
is that not what you're doing?

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
LAURA: That's what he's doing, Grog.
LIAM: It is. I'm getting a tattoo.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.500
ASHLEY: Close. Something like that.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.000
LIAM: It will say "Phillip the Brave".

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
TRAVIS: (gasps)
LIAM: Across the small of my back.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
TRAVIS: Phillip. Full name, Phillip.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
TALIESIN: This is out of--

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
I don't know if this is going to be
any help or anything,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
by the way, Vax, but just in case.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
I'm going to reach in

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
and pull out the mask 
and hand it to Vax.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.230
Just in case.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:05.816
LIAM: (slowly) I don't know.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.000
Thank you.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.350
MARISHA: Percy?

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.680
TALIESIN: Yes?

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.000
MARISHA: Do you still have 
that raven's skull I gave you?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
TALIESIN: I do. We'll talk about that.
MARISHA: All right.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.780
TALIESIN: But I've found in moments

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.000
when I was feeling less than brave

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
that pretending to be
somebody else on occasion,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
even afterwards, can be helpful.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
LIAM: Is there anything left 
inside of this?

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.500
TALIESIN: Just some spit.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.750
LIAM: That's wonderful.
LAURA: (laughs)

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.000
TALIESIN: And something that smells nice 
in the front that will help.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.590
It helps cleanse the air.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.570
LIAM: All right, Percival.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:49.870
TALIESIN: I don't know why. 
I'm feeling... what would be the word?

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:51.510
Superstitious.

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:54.250
MARISHA: Oh, I was 
going to say "giving."

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.380
LAURA: She's ornery today.
MARISHA: Sorry. Angry.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.310
TALIESIN: You know, 
I kind of like it.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:07.000
LIAM: You know. Enough chit-chat.
Let's get this shit done.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
MATT AND TRAVIS: All right.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
MATT: So you three 
are going to the Braving Grounds.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
You four are going to the Duskmeadow.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
LAURA: We are.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
MATT: Okay. All right, so.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.750
You three are making your way
towards the Braving Grounds.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.810
Following suit after Percival,

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:25.000
you make your way up
not quite to the Trial Forge,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
which is where you had 
your last discussion

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
and brief showdown 
with Earthbreaker Groon.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.160
Still seeing the large statue of Kord

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.410
looming over the entirety of the realm.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:40.000
You can still see the large columns
of dark smoke and soot

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
coming out of the various forges,
the various mining encampments,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.320
and a lot of the folks there

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.000
that are working on different pieces 
of iron and metal.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.000
You, I assume, make your way
to a very familiar abode. (laughs)

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
TALIESIN: Of all the options of the world
that you've given me...

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000
MATT: All right.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
(laughter)

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
TALIESIN: This is really your fault 
as much as it's mine.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000
MATT: You come up to the outside 
of a familiar hovel.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.100
Previously damaged,
missing part of its roof.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.000
The roof is mostly repaired.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.660
You actually see two individuals 
are over the top of it,

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.000
hammering pieces of wood into it.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.720
Not a very fine job, 
but definitely enough patchwork

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.530
to keep the rain and snow 
from pouring in.

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:32.500
The door is partially open 
as you approach.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
TALIESIN: (sighs heavily)

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
SAM: You might be blown up 
if you go in there.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
TALIESIN: I know.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
TRAVIS: Should we wait outside?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
TALIESIN: Let's just all be ginger.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
(louder) Hello? Victor, are you home?

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
It's Percy.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
MATT: Silence.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
SAM: Want me to go in 
and investigate?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
TALIESIN: Hold on. 
(louder) Hello, you up there? Hello?

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.590
MATT: (hammering noises)

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.000
"What?"

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
TALIESIN: Where is the owner 
of this domicile?

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
MATT: "I don't know. 
I haven't seen him."

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
TALIESIN: How long has he been gone for?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
MATT: "(mutters) 
(louder) Couple of hours."

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.740
SAM: Oh, good. Not dead, then.
TRAVIS: He's dead.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:27.000
(laughter)

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
TALIESIN: Do you have any idea
where he's been off to?

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
MATT: "I haven't seen him leave."

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
(hammering noises)

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.800
TALIESIN: Well, I'm going to pop in
and check really quickly,

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:36.860
just letting you know.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.260
MATT: "Your funeral."

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:41.000
(hammering noises)

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.920
TALIESIN: I gingerly open the door.
Can I check for traps?

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.000
TRAVIS: Attaboy.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
MATT: You may. 
Make an investigation check.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're standing right here.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
TALIESIN: Oh, yay, that's not that bad.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Investigation? I never use that.
11. No, 12. 12.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.360
MATT: 12, okay.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:05.600
(creak) You move the door open
and kind of search the ground

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:11.000
and the area before it
and the actual frame of the door itself.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.060
No traps.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.170
TALIESIN: All right.

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:16.000
MATT: Glancing inside, though,
you can see a little bit of light.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.500
It looks like there's
a hooded lantern across the way

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.000
and just a little bit of light is flickering

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
and it's kind of 
going against the wall nearest to you,

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.389
to your right, as you enter.

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:28.000
The same familiar smell of fresh earth,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000
really, really, really dry dust

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:39.000
and a very familiar smell
of explosive black powder material.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
TALIESIN: Oh, dear.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
SAM: Is Victor in there?

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
TALIESIN: No, I don't see anybody in here.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
SAM: Well, should we just

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.659
purchase what you need
via the honor system

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:50.210
and leave some coin behind?

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:54.770
TALIESIN: He's not necessarily
always a believer in coin.

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:56.750
Sometimes he just wants some trade.

00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:00.000
Also, I need to talk to him 
about some personal issues.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.440
MATT: (thud) You see off to the side,

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.260
what you didn't initially notice 
as you entered,

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:09.020
what appears to be a wooden trapdoor
in the far corner that (thud).

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.030
TALIESIN: Oh, sweet gods of Pelor!

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:14.430
MATT: (repeated thuds)

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:17.000
And you notice 
that apparently something--

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
a large sack 
of some heavy material

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.560
has rolled off a nearby table

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.000
and is now currently 
holding the door down.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
MATT: You hear a muffled,
"I'm inside!"

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.500
TALIESIN: I'm going to go 
try and lift it.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.000
TALIESIN: (grunts)

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
MATT: You lift it up, 
set it off to the side. (boosh)

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.600
"(coughing) What's going on?
You trying to kill me?"

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:45.000
TALIESIN: (laughs) No! Hello, Victor.
I was just to give you money.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
You were stuck--
you had gotten stuck down--

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.280
what is down there?

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.710
MATT: "This is my mining building."

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:52.590
SAM: Your mine?

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.000
TALIESIN: His Mayan building.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.370
Can you not 
understand simple English?

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:58.478
MATT: "Don't put things 
on top of the door.

00:35:58.478 --> 00:36:00.328
"It makes it hard to get out!"

00:36:00.328 --> 00:36:02.260
SAM: (whispering) 
Something's happened to him.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.850
TALIESIN: Are you all right?

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:06.000
MATT: "I'm okay!"

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
TALIESIN: Are you sure?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
MATT: "No, I've been locked 
down here for hours!"

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
ASHLEY: Oh no.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.420
TALIESIN: Grog, Scanlan?

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:19.000
(stutters) Come on in, he's fine.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
MATT: "Help me out!"

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
MATT: He raises his hands up.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.930
You can see now,
where once was two, now is none.

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:29.000
(sounds of dismay)

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.630
MATT: (grunts)

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:33.000
LIAM: You have to build him a hand.
TALIESIN: I know.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
MATT: (grunts)
"I can't wait all day, here!"

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
SAM: Grog, can you get him out,
can you lift him up?

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
TALIESIN: Grog, can you lift the poor--
TRAVIS: All right, yeah.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.270
TRAVIS: I grab the stump
and I pick him up into the air.

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:46.000
MATT: (screams)

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.580
TRAVIS: I shake him a little bit.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.730
TALIESIN: I need him mostly intact.

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:52.930
TRAVIS: Oh. So on the ground?

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:54.800
TALIESIN: Treat him slightly better
than you would treat

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.333
a member of your own family.

00:36:56.333 --> 00:36:58.016
MATT: "Don't shake me too hard."

00:36:58.016 --> 00:37:00.000
TALIESIN: More than slightly better. 
Much better.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
LAURA: Oh, don't shake him too hard--
I'm not there.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.053
TRAVIS: Oh. Gas.

00:37:04.053 --> 00:37:05.293
MATT: "Sure."

00:37:05.293 --> 00:37:07.000
TRAVIS: I put him gently 
back on the ground.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000
MATT: "Thank you."

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.580
He pats you on the head 
with his nub.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:10.700
SAM: Ugh.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.070
MATT: Goes over. You can see 
he's kind of bandaged.

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:17.030
He goes over and then pulls the ladder up
that he didn't use, closes the--

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:21.000
TRAVIS: (laughing) The ladder 
he didn't use?

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.220
MATT: "Okay. So. What do you want?"

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.200
TALIESIN: Well, I was hoping to buy

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.650
a little bit more black powder 
from you, if possible,

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:33.000
and I'm curious if you had 
anything else for sale,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.830
and I wanted to ask you 
a couple of questions,

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:38.000
just about other customers again.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.560
MATT: "That's a lot."
TALIESIN: I know.

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.620
MATT: "I have powder."

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:43.730
TALIESIN: You do.

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:47.000
MATT: "I can sell you more powder.
Question one: yes. How much?"

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
TALIESIN: One question?

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
LIAM: First question.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
TALIESIN: First question.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Has a one-armed lady, 
a one-handed lady,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
a doctor come by to purchase--

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.405
MATT: "Not a lady. 
I am an honorable man!"

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.980
TRAVIS: Don't insult him.
TALIESIN: I know.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:10.000
TALIESIN: And I would never 
insult your honor

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
or preferences of any kind.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.188
MATT: "Are you saying I'm pretty?"

00:38:16.188 --> 00:38:19.000
TALIESIN: Victor, I think you know 
how I feel about that,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
but you're 
a very attractive man, and--

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
MATT: "Your friend's hitting on me."
TRAVIS: I know it.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.500
MATT: "I'm taken."

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.000
TRAVIS: He's taken.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
TALIESIN: Are you dating right now?

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
MATT: "No, I'm just taken."

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.394
(laughs) I can't. 
I'm sorry. I'm good.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.840
MATT: "(shouting) How much?"

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.500
TALIESIN: Well, I was going to offer,

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.000
I was originally going to offer 
some gold if you like,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.046
but if you'd like,
I could make you a tool

00:38:45.046 --> 00:38:48.000
you could use 
with your current predicament.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Some sort of simple
clawing mechanism

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
for grasping, lifting,
not getting caught in your mine.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
MATT: "Maybe. Maybe.
Maybe a trade? Maybe a claw?"

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
TALIESIN: I love trade. 
Trade is brilliant.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.325
MATT: "Build and bring.
Build and bring, and we trade."

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000
TALIESIN: I would ask one other thing,
if I am to do this for you.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.500
MATT: "Oh, so many questions!

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.000
"Does he have questions, too?
Does he have questions, too?!"

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.500
SAM: I do 
have a question, actually.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.000
TALIESIN: You have a question?
SAM: Yes, I do.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
TRAVIS: I don't, no. 
I don't have any questions. None.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
MATT: (sighs) "I like him. 
What's your question?"

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.500
SAM: I'm just looking 
for a hat shop.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.000
Is there a hat shop around here?

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000
MATT: (considering noise)

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
And he starts pulling around
from a pile of oiled rags and shit

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
and he pulls up
what looks like a small burlap sack

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
that's torn somewhat at the opening.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
"Hat."

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
SAM: Oh, god. Ugh.
All right, thank you. Thank you.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
MATT: "My pleasure. 
Happy to help." (chuckles)

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000
SAM: Okay.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
TALIESIN: That was everything
I could have hoped for, and more.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
MATT: "Don't get near the fire."

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
TALIESIN: Really, don't.
SAM: Thank you.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
TALIESIN: Has Dr. Ripley--
has a woman come by to buy black powder,

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.500
one hand, one mechanical hand,

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.000
one normal hand? Mechanical hand?

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
MATT: "Is that the one
you're saying you can make?"

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
TALIESIN: I'm going 
to make you something,

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.700
nice and useful claw piece, yes.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.000
MATT: "So you're saying 
that this woman

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
"made a better hand 
than you can make?"

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.500
TALIESIN: No, I can make 
a better hand.

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.780
MATT: "Then make me a better hand!
Why would you give me a lesser hand?!"

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:15.080
TALIESIN: You're going to need to give me
quite a bit of black powder for that.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.000
And more questions.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
TRAVIS: Ooh.
MATT: "Really?"

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
(laughter)

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.700
MATT: "I've had a bad day."

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:28.260
TALIESIN: Is that recent?
SAM: That happened today?

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:30.000
TALIESIN: It doesn't look that recent.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.500
MATT: (ripping sounds)

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.000
He starts unwrapping the wound.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
TALIESIN: Oh, that's recent.
That's wet. That's very wet.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.340
MATT: It's pretty recent.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:39.974
TALIESIN: I can work with that.
I can work with that.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.640
I'm going to go construct you something

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:48.020
that will be perfect for your needs.
I have a great idea.

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:53.000
I will need another hogshead and a half 
of black powder

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
and a little information
about another customer

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
and then I will leave you 
to your work. Is that fair?

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.500
MATT: "Fair!"

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:05.430
He turns around, rushes over,
and grabs the same phantom hogshead

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:06.650
that he has lying around his place.

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:08.000
TALIESIN: He eats a lot of pork.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.650
MATT: Before he fills it with powder,
he goes over to Scanlan and goes,

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:14.500
"(hums) Too big."

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.000
TRAVIS: Good hat.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
MATT: Fills it with black powder,
carefully brings it over,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
holding it under his arm.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.660
(grunts)

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:25.000
TALIESIN: Thank you. (grunts)

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
I will put this 
in something reasonable.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.680
I'll be back 
in just a little bit with--

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:35.730
actually, do you have a glove
that you used to wear,

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:37.940
or anything like that? 
Do you have something?

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.000
MATT: "Yes!"

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.810
He pulls out the glove 
that was on the hand,

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:44.000
(laughing) and you can see
that it's blown apart,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.360
hand burned to cinders--

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.960
TALIESIN: I can 
take measurements from that.

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.880
MATT: It's more a sleeve 
with a charcoaled edge.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.000
TALIESIN: I'm going to be busy. 
Can you cast the--

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
SAM: No, but Keyleth can,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
and I think that would save you 
a lot of time.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
MARISHA: I'm not here.
TALIESIN: She's not here.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
SAM: No, but we can go get her 
and come back.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.680
TALIESIN: To?
SAM: To just fix his hand.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.500
TALIESIN: I don't think 
she can just fix his hand.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.670
SAM: Someone can restore something.
Maybe Pike can.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:12.000
MARISHA: I can. 
Not today, but I can over time.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
TRAVIS: Want me to give it a try?

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.670
TALIESIN: While I'm tempted-- 
would you just--

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:19.333
I feel like I made a deal.

00:42:19.333 --> 00:42:21.000
I'm just going to have to see to it.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.190
SAM: I think he would prefer
a real hand than a claw hand.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:25.470
TALIESIN: Would you prefer 
a real hand or a claw hand?

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:28.000
MATT: "Depends. 
How cool is the claw hand?"

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.630
TRAVIS AND SAM: (laugh)

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.410
TALIESIN: That's what I thought.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:35.000
SAM: I would much rather 
you spend time

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
on projects for us 
than projects for him.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.500
TALIESIN: This is projects for us.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.590
TRAVIS: I vote for the claw. 
It's pretty cool.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:42.500
TALIESIN: And believe me, I would like--

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.000
MATT: "Cooler than that lady's hand?"

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.500
TALIESIN: Keeping him happy is pertinent.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.000
I can make this myself, 
it's just very difficult.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
SAM: We have party members
who can regrow his hand.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.510
TRAVIS: Hey, Percy.
TALIESIN: Yes?

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:53.170
TRAVIS: He wants the claw to be cooler 
than that lady's claw hand.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:56.000
TALIESIN: That's very easy to do.
She has no aesthetics whatsoever.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.570
TRAVIS: All right. 
Then eff the old original hand.

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:00.320
Let's give him 
a reasonable claw, yeah?

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.500
TALIESIN: Don't worry about it.
SAM: All right.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.000
TALIESIN: It'll be fine.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.500
And if you can't do the mansion,

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.000
I know where I can 
go get some work done.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.130
SAM: Oh, you want me to make--
we have the Slayer's Take.

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:11.000
They have a workshop, don't they?

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
TALIESIN: If not, I know
where I can work on something.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
I will be back.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.840
I will not leave town
before I've delivered to you something--

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.000
MATT: "(squawks)"

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.770
He takes the hogshead.

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:20.500
TALIESIN: Oh! Absolutely fair.

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.000
MATT: "Trade when you bring hand."

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.500
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:30.000
MATT: "Then I deliver with new hand.
Then all is well."

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.650
MATT: "No more questions!"

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:36.000
TALIESIN: No. That's fine.
We'll be back! It'll be good.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
MATT: "You're small."

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
SAM: I need a big hat.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.710
MATT: "Can't help you, sorry."

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:44.730
SAM: All right.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:46.630
TALIESIN: Are we going to go 
find a hat shop, then?

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:49.000
SAM: Maybe, if we pass one.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
TALIESIN: All right. 
We will be back. Stay safe.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000
MATT: "Okay. 
Don't touch the door, please!"

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.430
TALIESIN: Yes. No. Just. 
We'll be back. Bye!

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:04.060
TALIESIN: I'm going to go find
a workshop to work on something.

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:07.000
TRAVIS: I like you. 
We'll see you later.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
MATT: "(chuckles) Heâ€™s big."

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
TRAVIS: (chuckles)

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
TALIESIN: And I'm just right.
It's... a thing.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
MATT: "I'm undecided about you."

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.430
TALIESIN: You're not alone.

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:22.000
I'm going to go see
if the Slayer's Take has--

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.440
SAM: We're going to leave.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:26.930
TALIESIN: I cannot handle 
any more of that. That was brutal.

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:28.000
SAM: Too good.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.220
TRAVIS: I feel like 
youâ€™re just on a higher level.

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:33.000
ASHLEY: Right?
LAURA: So much.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.800
LAURA: I just thought you were
going to make him not there

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.500
so you didn't have to do it.

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.000
MATT: No no no.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.310
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah yeah.
He's just not home. Sorry, guys.

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:43.000
ASHLEY: Oh, I love him.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.500
MARISHA: Victor's on vacation.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.410
TALIESIN: So, I'm going to go 
see if there's--

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:48.000
if there's not a blacksmithing,

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
if there's not somewhere I can do

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
a bit of basic smithing work 
and technical work,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.560
then I'm going to go 
find that blacksmith from last time.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.940
MATT: There's basic materials to do

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:00.500
essentially weapon repairs, 
armor repairs,

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:03.000
minor armor construction
within the Slayer's Take.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.500
If you want something 
that's going to be

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.580
a little more to the level 
of what you're doing,

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:09.000
you may have to actually 
rent out a facility.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
TALIESIN: Well, I'm going to go find
that young chap from before.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
MATT: Okay. Yeah, easy enough to do.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
If you want to rent the forge 
for the day

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
to craft whatever it is 
you're looking to craft,

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.530
he's charging you 
50 gold for the day.

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:23.000
TALIESIN: 50 gold for the day?

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Can I use all of his tools
and just my own materials?

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
MATT: You have to supply 
your own material, but he'll let you rent.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
TALIESIN: I'm going to run and find Vax,
get my stuff, and go to work.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.520
MATT: Okay. You guys.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:40.650
You four make your way
over towards the Duskmeadow.

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:42.000
LAURA: Trinket's out.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
MATT: Trinket's out? (whoosh)

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.810
(bear moans)

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:47.000
LAURA: Come on, Trinket.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.650
MATT: (grunts)

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:51.700
He rolls his head against you,
licks the side of your face,

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:55.000
happy to be out 
of that stuffy little necklace.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
You make your way towards the Duskmeadow,
which you've seen before.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.240
It's a very comparatively...

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.300
glum-looking area of the town,

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.760
hence the name that accompanies it,

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:12.000
but this is the area 
of the city that contains

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000
the Raven's Crest,
the Amaranthine Oubliette.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:24.000
It also contains 
the entire town's catacombs.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.480
This is where, 
since this town's existence,

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.160
all of the dead are interred

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:34.000
perpetually deeper and deeper and deeper
beneath this part of the city.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.620
Also one of
the oldest libraries of the city

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.800
is kept here as well.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.660
As you approach the outskirts--
and you can see a very fine line

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:45.800
between this area and the Birth Heart,

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:49.000
which is the Melora section of the city.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
There is a very, very wide river divide
between the two of them

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
and it's like night and day, 
back and back.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Very, very, very directly 
between the two of them.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000
You can see on Melora's side
there's just stalks and stalks of corn

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000
and other vegetation 
that's being grown for food.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
There's almost like a lush forest
that curls around the outside of it

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000
that doesn't match 
the rest of the indigenous trees

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
you've seen in this area of Othanzia.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:23.000
The entire Birth Heart area,
where this temple to Melora is,

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000
is just this

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.790
plucked-out-of-nowhere section 
placed into it.

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:28.190
And then you move over
to the Duskmeadow

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:34.460
and it's just... like the color 
has left the vicinity.

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.000
And there you see in the center
of this part of the town,

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:43.530
this large, looming,
ominous obsidian and gold structure.

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:47.500
It's like a giant black stone aerie.

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:50.990
It has no intricacies 
from this distance that you can see.

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:57.000
It's almost like a giant square building
that is just devoid of light,

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000
with little glimmers of gold
when the light catches it at moments.

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:03.000
It's hard to miss

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.710
and definitely stands as a centerpiece 
to this section of Vasselheim.

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:08.240
LIAM: The whole walk over,

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.840
I've been talking a lot,
mostly to Trinket.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.600
You know, scratching him 
behind the ears, saying,

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:18.130
"Buddy, you've been 
trapped in there a while.

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:19.710
"It's good to see you out."

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:21.000
MATT: "(moans, snuffles)"

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.550
LIAM: Come hug your uncle. Come.
LAURA: He doesn't mind it.

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:26.000
LIAM: I'm sure he doesn't.
I'm just happy to see him.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
MATT: He presses his nose 
under yours

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.050
and lifts your chin up
and you bite your lip a little

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:32.000
from the sudden impact 
from this very large bear,

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
but it's all with love.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000
LIAM: Yeah. It's cold. You're sure 
you don't want to go back in?

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.910
Nah, you don't want to go back in. 
I know.

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:41.000
MARISHA: (whispering) Hey, Pike.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
LIAM: Just nervous talking 
the whole way there.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
MARISHA: (whispering) 
I think Vax is talking to himself.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
ASHLEY: (whispering) 
He's very nervous right now.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.710
ASHLEY: This is a big deal.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:55.000
ASHLEY: This temple is very...
it's lovely.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
MARISHA: It's gorgeous. 
It's very intimidating.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.020
Do you know anything about this?
You've lived here for a while, Pike.

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:05.000
ASHLEY: I've never been by.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
MARISHA: Never been in?
ASHLEY: I've never been in, no.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
MATT: You do know from your time here
and what little you've heard

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
that part of the purpose 
of this vicinity

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.500
is not just to inter the dead
within part of these catacombs.

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:22.000
The library here 
is kind of a loose partnership

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.500
between the people worshipers of her
and those who follow Ioun.

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:31.000
It is a center for knowledge and history
kept within the city.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.540
But you'll see throughout the town
and the landscaped outer wall

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:38.740
that surrounds this entire portion 
of Vasselheim,

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:45.020
there are repetitive glyphs
that line this entire area.

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:48.840
And from what you've heard,
at the very least, most of these glyphs,

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.000
which you see 
across the corners of roadways,

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.820
and many of which surround
the entrance to the catacombs,

00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:02.620
it is a perpetual enchantment that is 
to seal any sort of possible undeath.

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:05.380
There once was 
a terrible scourge of undeath

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:08.000
in this part of the landscape, 
long ago,

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000
that corresponded with a battle 
hundreds of years ago,

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.500
and since then, the reinforcement 
has been put in place

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.000
to prevent that 
from happening again.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
So the downside is

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.780
that the power of these glyphs 
that prevent undeath

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:23.000
also prevent any actual vegetation
from existing in this area as well.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.680
So all the ground 
that you've come across:

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:29.410
no grass, no natural vegetation.

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:33.000
It's just dirt and ash and dust.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.970
MARISHA: Can we recognize the language
in which the runes come from?

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:43.390
MATT: The magic itself 
is divine in nature,

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:46.000
but it's based in the same
very, very base Draconic glyphs

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000
that a lot of arcane magic 
is based on.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.160
It's very-- it's &lt;i&gt;old&lt;/i&gt; magic.

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:53.100
ASHLEY: (laughs) It's old.

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:58.010
MATT: Yeah. It's based 
in some sort of divine ritual.

00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:00.500
MARISHA: What did you say 
the name was

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.000
of the Raven Queen's temple, again?

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000
MATT: The temple itself 
is referred to as Raven's Crest.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.340
MARISHA: Raven's Crest?

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:07.500
MATT: Raven's Crest, yes.

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.960
MARISHA: Okay.

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.330
ASHLEY: How are you feeling, Vax?

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:13.740
LIAM: I'm all right.

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:16.880
I'm just going to talk 
to my sister for a minute.

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.000
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.000
LIAM: You know, 
I know you want to--

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000
I know you.
I know you want to be here.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
LAURA: I know you don't 
want me to come.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
LIAM: I don't. 
I really don't.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:36.000
LAURA: I know. 
And I won't, if you're sure.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.130
I put you in this place 
and I feel terrible about it

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:42.170
and I know you're extremely nervous.

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:45.070
Trinket can sense it, too.
He's very in tune with those emotions.

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:46.650
And I just--

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:48.850
LIAM: Listen to me.

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:52.620
You did not 
put me in this place.

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:55.500
No one put me in this place.

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:58.040
LIAM: And everything's going to be fine.
LAURA: Everything will be fine!

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:02.890
LIAM: And I tug her sleeves
and make them a little more orderly

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:07.580
and I move a bit of hair out of her face
and I do a button that's not done.

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.000
LAURA: (laughs)

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.730
LIAM: Everything's going to be fine.
LAURA: I wanted it unbuttoned, actually.

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:16.020
LIAM: That's all right. Just wait here
I'll be out in a bit, all right?

00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:18.000
LAURA: Yes.
LIAM: Everything's fine.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.020
LAURA: I know. Everything's fine.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:22.000
LAURA: You don't need 
to be nervous, either.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.500
LIAM: I'm not.

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:28.000
LAURA: I will be here waiting for you
when you come out.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000
LIAM: I know. I'll see you--

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000
LAURA: I love you.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000
LIAM: You know I love you, too.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
LAURA: I'm proud of you, you know.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
She's just going to love you so much.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000
And who knows,

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.500
you might have a new girlfriend 
when you come out.

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.000
(laughs nervously, sighs)

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.020
I've heard other people 
have dated gods before.

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:49.000
I've heard it's done.
That Cashew guy. Anyway.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.500
LIAM: You're going 
to wait here for me, right?

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:53.500
LAURA: I'll be right here.

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:55.000
LIAM: And then I drop the smile

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000
as I walk off towards the other two.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000
MATT: Okay.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Which, as you turn and look,

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
when you originally approached

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.000
the stairs that lead up to the entrance 
of this large structure,

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
it was just empty, doors closed.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000
There was no guard post 
on the outside.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.000
It was just these two looming,
almost dark glass-type doors

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.050
about 12 feet tall
and about 8 feet wide on each side

00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:16.120
that are just locked shut.

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.000
As soon as you turn 
to walk towards them,

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000
the doors open and you see a figure 
standing there at the door,

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.500
just looking directly at you.

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:23.750
Or at least you assume 
is looking right at you.

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:25.000
It's hard to see.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000
This individual, 
somewhat lithe in physicality,

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000
is wearing long, dark robes

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000
and their face is shrouded
in opaque black cloth,

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
like a death shroud
that just blocks the entire face.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000
You can see 
the hint of a jawline, a nose.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.000
It looks to be a person
of some background in there,

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000
but they're just standing there,
watching you.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.910
And as soon as you react 
to their appearance,

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:52.880
the hand just beckons quietly.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.110
LIAM: Were you expecting me?

00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:01.000
All right.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.440
I've brought a couple of friends.
Is that permissible here?

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:11.310
They'll keep quiet.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.550
MARISHA: I turn to Vex.

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:16.000
LAURA: Keep him safe.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.990
MARISHA: I swear to you.

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:21.840
We're all coming out of here alive.

00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.440
LAURA: I know.

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:27.000
MARISHA: But if like an hour passes 
and we don't,

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000
maybe come in?

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.500
But we're all 
coming out of here alive,

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:32.500
so don't worry about it.

00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:33.640
It's fine.

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.000
ASHLEY: And I squeeze her hand.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000
I'll make sure 
he gets out okay. I promise.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000
LAURA: All right.
ASHLEY: Okay. Please be safe.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.630
LAURA: It'll be fine.
ASHLEY: It'll be fine. Yes.

00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:45.470
LAURA: I'll just be right here.
Waiting here with Trinket.

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:46.500
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:49.030
LAURA: Just calmly leaning 
against a wall. No big deal.

00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:50.000
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.650
MARISHA: We've faced 
way more terrifying things

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:58.000
than a few albeit creepy 
men in robes.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.530
LAURA: I don't even think she's that bad.

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:01.159
She's not going to be bad.

00:55:01.159 --> 00:55:02.237
LIAM: Guys.
LAURA: Just go.

00:55:02.237 --> 00:55:04.250
ASHLEY: Okay. We'll go. 
We'll go in with you.

00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:05.570
MATT: All right.

00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:09.750
As you step up to the stairs,
the figure leads you all inside,

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:13.840
and as you step into the main center
of this initial walkway chamber,

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.800
the figure doesn't enter with you.

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.510
It just closes the door behind you.

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:18.670
(echoing thud)

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:21.000
You can feel
the hint of vibration of impact

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
as the doors close shut.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000
MARISHA: It's dark?

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.470
MATT: It's lowly-lit on the inside,
and it's interesting.

00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:28.000
From the outside, it looks like

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000
a black, solid,
impossible-to-see-through building.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
From the inside, 
you can actually look out

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.370
and the entire building

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:40.000
is made of this glass,
this somewhat-warped, dark glass.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.850
And you can see almost
the entirety of the outside

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:44.960
from your position.

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:46.830
The doors are held aloft into it.

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:48.720
It's like a one-way 
type enchantment,

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:53.300
or the construct, the material itself,
is somewhat translucent from this side.

00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:57.670
MARISHA: Like an interrogation room?
Like one-way mirror type of thing?

00:55:57.670 --> 00:56:00.190
MATT: Kind of. Or like a very,
very dark pair of sunglasses,

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:05.000
but made of naturally-formed rock, almost.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.900
LIAM: Noticing that, I turn

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:11.890
and just sort of look at my sister
for 5 or 10 more seconds.

00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:16.130
MATT: She doesn't see you
and she just stands there quietly,

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:19.000
looking around, 
inspecting the vicinity.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Pets Trinket a little.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.000
LIAM: (hesitantly) Let's do this.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.690
SAM: (chuckles)

00:56:27.690 --> 00:56:31.000
ASHLEY: Do I feel anything, 
being in here?

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.670
MATT: You just feel 
a natural tremble

00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:37.000
stepping into a place 
of powerful divine influence

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.430
that is not 
the warm comfort of Sarenrae,

00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:41.000
which has protected you before.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Now, you understand the way
many deities work in these lands,

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000
and your place in it,
and Sarenrae's place in it,

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000
and you know enough 
about the Raven Queen

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000
to know that this is not 
an unwelcome place, per se.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Go ahead and roll a religion check.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000
ASHLEY: 23.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.000
MATT: 23. 
You understand the Raven Queen

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.520
has also not always been

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:19.000
the one who holds sway

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
over the domain of death,
the domain of winter,

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000
the domain of fate.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Once mortal,
the Raven Queen ascended

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.330
as, essentially, a follower
and a partner

00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:34.210
to the previous god of death,

00:57:34.210 --> 00:57:37.000
which his name
has been erased from the books.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:44.000
This mortal ascended many,
many years ago, pre-Second Spark,

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000
and has since taken what was once

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.000
a tyrannical position of death
and afterlife and souls

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000
and took it instead
as the natural transition that it is.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000
However, 
due to a lack of respect,

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.000
or at least, a lack of, 
for lack of a better term,

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.330
belief or trust from the other gods,

00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:13.000
she only gained dominion
over the actual moment of transition,

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000
not of the actual souls 
of the afterlife.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:20.000
That influence was given to others.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.000
But the Raven Queen represents

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000
one of the most feared elements of life,

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.500
which is the end of it,

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:33.000
but you also know 
that that is a natural thing.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.000
Your personal belief is up to you.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.000
The sense you get here is that...

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.280
being an individual 
that worships life,

00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:47.000
that worships redemption,
that worships second chances,

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
you can't help
but swallow a little hard

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000
at the idea of a god that's purpose
is to make sure

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.010
that if you're destined 
to have once chance,

00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:56.510
it stays one chance.

00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:58.230
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:58:58.230 --> 00:59:00.500
MATT: As you begin 
to walk down this hall,

00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:02.000
ever so slow as it is,

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.190
each footfall deafening 
in the clack.

00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:08.000
(clicking footsteps)

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.000
The hallway leads on
for another hundred feet or so

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:16.000
before the glass,
somewhat translucent material

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
shifts into the next chamber,

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.500
into an almost

00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:23.000
deep gray and ivory ice-like interior.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
The dark,
coal-black exterior you've seen

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
now transitions into what feels like

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.180
a very finely-carved 
piece of architecture

00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:33.630
from ice and bone.

00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:38.700
MARISHA: Do I get the sense
as a druid, as an Ashari,

00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:42.000
that we've switched into another plane?

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.420
MATT: Go ahead and roll an arcana check,

00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:51.000
as this is not so much
a nature-based thing, yeah.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:55.000
MARISHA: Oh! I rolled a 19. 
(laughs) 21.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000
LIAM: Oh dear, oh my.
LAURA: Oh gosh, oh jeez.

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.720
MARISHA: Oh goodness gracious.

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.000
MATT: From your understanding

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.500
of transitional magic between planes,

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.000
there has been
no actual shift between planes,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
it's just the material itself

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.000
is different upon the interior
of this building.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.500
As soon as you enter this place,

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.000
you do see another figure
walking towards you.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Similar long, dark robes.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
However, the veil 
has been pulled back,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.230
and you see before you 
what looks to be

01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:29.000
an older elven woman with very, 
very bright silver hair

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000
that just kind of falls long,
past her shoulders,

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
down to her back about mid-waist,
or down to the bottom of her waist.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
With a smile.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:45.000
You can see as she walks towards you,
a very welcoming grin.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
As she approaches,
she pays very little mind to you three,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.500
but directly to you, says,

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.000
LAURA: (whispers) I'm not there.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
MATT: "You walk with Her sight on you.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
"You are ever welcome here."

01:00:58.590 --> 01:01:00.460
LIAM: I've come

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:07.000
to understand
my place in Her sight.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.020
MATT: "Then I think, perhaps, 
you are here for communion.

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:19.000
"Come. Our most sacred chamber.
The communion pool awaits.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.350
"Only you may have entry,
unfortunately."

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.600
LIAM: Right.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.010
LIAM: I plant a kiss on the cheek 
of each of the women.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
MARISHA: Do you need anything
before you go in?

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Any enhancement of any kind?

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
LIAM: Just cross 
your fingers for me, okay?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
MARISHA: Okay.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.750
I just kind of squeeze his hand.

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:57.000
ASHLEY: Same.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Be careful.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
MARISHA: We're right out here
on the other side of this door.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.000
If anything terrible happens,
you have the earpiece.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
No one will stop Pike and I
from getting through there

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
if something terrible goes wrong.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.500
Rules be damned.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:24.000
LIAM: I made my bed. Now I gotta lie in it.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I'll see you soon.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.590
I follow.

01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:33.060
MATT: "Come, champion. 
The Lady of Fates awaits."

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:36.000
And she turns around
and leads you 30 more feet

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
to what looks to be
an ascending staircase

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.760
that just enters
up and out of the sight of you two.

01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:47.780
ASHLEY: We'll just hang out, yeah?

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:50.000
MARISHA: I guess we'll wait, yeah.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
MATT: You ascend
a few feet behind her,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
about 40 or so feet,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
until it comes
to a single large doorway

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
of deep, deep dark oak wood

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
with what looks to be
a dark iron ring in the center.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.930
As she steps up to it, she takes it 
and (thud) knocks on it twice.

01:03:10.930 --> 01:03:17.170
(deep creak) It just shifts open
and leads into a central chamber now

01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:22.000
that looks about a hundred feet high,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.540
and it is a large steepled dome

01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:28.000
of what looks to be nothing
but stained glass.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
It's awe-inspiring.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
It's beautiful: the colors,
the light as it peeks through.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
The source of light,
diffused as it is by the clouds,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.500
is sourceless in here.

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.000
It seems like there are beams of light
coming from all directions

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.500
and all the colors
are just strewn across the floor

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:47.630
in what looks like this
perpetually-shifting kaleidoscope

01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:54.390
of dots of reds and blues and purples
and yellows and pinks and whites.

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:59.000
You can see, across the room,
there are three other figures

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.840
that are all dressed
in the same dark robes,

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.000
the veils over their heads,
of varying size.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
You can't make out
what their racial background is, per se,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.500
but they are all stationed
around the center of the room,

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.000
in which lies, from what you can see,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.000
a very, very large round pool
of some sort of deep crimson liquid.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
LIAM: I have come to pay a debt,

01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:37.580
and I do so gladly
and without question.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.910
What would you have of me?

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
MATT: "You came to speak with the Lady.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
"Well, the way is before you."

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.050
She gestures to the pool.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
LIAM: I walk slow and straight in.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.610
MATT: You step into it. (squelch)

01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:02.000
It comes up to your ankles,
to your knees.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
And what catches you first
is that the liquid is very thick.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
It is viscous in a familiar way.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
This is most definitively
a pool of blood.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000
And it is cold. It is ice-cold.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000
As you step in, you can feel that
as it begins to seep into your boots

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.600
and begins to find its way
into the crevices of your outfit

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.000
as you get down into your waist,
it's just chilling.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
You can't help but to stand up straight
as you step further in,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
not quite sure of how deep it gets.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
And it gets deeper. And deeper.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Up past your chest,
up past your shoulders,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.940
and you're not even
halfway into the center of the pool

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:43.000
before it's going past your nose.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.790
LIAM: I keep going.

01:05:44.790 --> 01:05:49.000
MATT: You take your last breath, hold it,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
and submerge yourself in the pool.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.750
Darkness around you,
the cold sensation.

01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.850
Nothing...

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:03.060
Nothing...

01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:07.590
Nothing...

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:12.150
LIAM: I open my mouth and inhale.

01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:16.590
MATT: As you do, 
you feel the blood fill your lungs

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:21.000
and immediately your lungs begin to seize
with the lack of oxygen.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
You instinctually begin
to reach up for the water and pull,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
but you can't rise.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
You can't get up.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.940
And at that point, the cold, piercing pain
of the liquid in your lungs

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:36.000
becomes warm.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
All the liquid around you
becomes warm.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.050
And in the darkness,
where you cannot see,

01:06:42.050 --> 01:06:45.790
you calm, as suddenly your breathing
is no longer difficult.

01:06:45.790 --> 01:06:48.360
It's natural. It's like air.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.420
And it's reminiscent
of being in the womb,

01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:59.640
of the moment of birth
you'd forgotten so long ago,

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:03.000
that you're just surrounded
in darkness and comfort.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.790
And piercing the center
of this darkness before you,

01:07:04.790 --> 01:07:07.470
you see
a very faint bead of white light

01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:12.000
just begin to spark
and grow, and grow,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
and as that light widens out,
it becomes a face.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
A porcelain face.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:24.000
A nose, lips, a chin,
empty dark sockets,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.690
long dark hair
that goes to crimson and surrounds you.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.690
You see a small hand
reach up behind

01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:36.000
and lift you from your legs.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.880
And for what you thought
was only a few feet of liquid,

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.000
you look around you
and it is an endless space,

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
a space you've been before,

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000
a space that you once visited
in your sleep, in your dreams.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.500
You look down below and you can see

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:54.910
the infinite skein of threads
that you were once given inspection to.

01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:59.000
As you look down, you see the very palm
of the Raven Queen

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
holding you aloft in this space

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
as the mask
pulls in close to you with a smile.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.500
The lips don't move,

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:09.000
but you hear a voice
from all directions in your head.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.210
A comforting voice.
A welcoming voice.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
"My champion.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.580
"Vax'ildan.
You've come to me at last."

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:27.410
LIAM: This was always
supposed to happen, wasn't it?

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
MATT: "There is destiny,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
"but you still guide your path
where it must go.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
"Especially you, fate-touched.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.020
"You're one of the few 
that bends threads near and around you.

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.000
"That's why you're 
so interesting to me."

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
LIAM: (haltingly)
I give myself willingly to you

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.569
for the bargain that was struck,

01:09:04.569 --> 01:09:08.000
although I question
if the bargain

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
was just the surface reason
for this to happen.

01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:19.740
MATT: "When one such as your...

01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:25.430
"unique essence walks these realms,

01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:29.000
"do not think I am
the only one to take interest.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.689
"And do not think you are
the only one, either.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
"But I was there
to seize the opportunity when it arose,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000
"and as such, you are now mine.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.000
"And I know that you hate me.
I know that you fear me.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
"Most do.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.390
"But only because they are
without understanding.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:57.000
"Without death, life has no meaning.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.590
"Finality drives change,

01:09:59.590 --> 01:10:01.840
"innovation,

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:04.030
"greatness.

01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:06.000
"It is the end that I bring

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:13.000
"that drives all of your gracious creations
of this land

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.470
"to make the world better than we did,
than those before me did."

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
LIAM: I would learn your ways.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
I will learn your purpose.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And I will serve.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.450
MATT: "Then understand
the wholeness of what it is you serve

01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:39.000
"and what you represent, champion.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
"Even after death, the soul is carried
to another purpose,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.560
"but it is that transition
where it is at its most vulnerable.

01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:55.000
"It is my charge, my gift--
your gift, now--

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.550
"to safeguard that beautiful moment.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
"There are those that find
the immortal soul

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.580
"one of the most pure
and powerful means

01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:14.950
"of energy, of sourced power,
in this world.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
"That is an abomination.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.000
"There are those
that wish to halt the process

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.590
"and live eternally
in some form of undeath or the other.

01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:30.000
"That is an abomination.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
"There is also a difference

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000
"between bending your thread 
around destiny, fate-touched,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
"and perverting the thread entirely,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
"for death is sacred.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000
"But not all deaths are destined,
in that moment.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
"Some destinies require one
to endure beyond the moment.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.000
"To meet that moment many times
before the final death is to come.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
"We must guide these moments
across this web."

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
And as she sweeps her hand out.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.270
Where she holds you in one palm,
another hand reaches out,

01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:08.000
and the entire web of threads
just glows below you

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
in this curling wave
out into infinity, into the horizons,

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
endless, to each side of you and beyond.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
"So, to bend destiny, 
to bend these fates,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
"is within our sphere of influence.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
"It's those that find a way
to cheat this destiny,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
"halt the progression,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
"corrupt their thread to the point
it sickens those around them.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
"Undeath, wayward necromancy.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
"Perversion
of the sanctity of the cycle,

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
"of our very domain, is an atrocity

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.000
"and must be stopped 
and stamped out.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000
"That is our cause.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.640
"Your cause, now.

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.160
"Do you still accept this gift?"

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.630
LIAM: (whispering) I do.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.780
MATT: "You, Vax'ildan.
I've had my eye on you for some time."

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
And the smile curls
into this much wider smile.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.000
To the point it seems 
somewhat perturbing.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:31.000
"Your dual nature:
rushing prematurely towards your end,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
"wantonly throwing your life
before the flames,

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
"only to pull away
in those last moments.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
"Instinct.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000
"You test your path constantly,
without knowing

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.850
"you've been preparing 
for this mantle your entire life.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
"My beautiful champion."

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
The smile subsides.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:05.000
The face goes stone.
Lack of expression. Blank.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
The hand pulls back
and you now can see

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
the full immensity of her size.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.770
Her body infinitely long, 
looking down

01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:15.000
before it disappears 
into darkness.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
And as you look up,

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.500
suddenly the mask
is there before you,

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:22.000
but normal, human-sized.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
You're no longer in her hand.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.870
You're standing on a floor,

01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:29.810
a floor of the same white,
ice-bone type substance

01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:35.000
that the interior of Raven's Crest
seems to be built from.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
And for a brief moment,
you see before you

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.000
the woman before the god,
the ascended mortal,

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
no larger than you.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
From the hair
that topples down the sides,

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.990
the hand reaches up
and grabs the mask and pulls it away.

01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:57.000
Beneath the mask you see

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.430
a very beautiful, 
very sad-looking woman.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.000
But her eyes 
are cold and red in the iris.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.850
Her skin flawless and smooth.
White, pale, sunless.

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:15.000
Her brows thinned and furrowed.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
She steps forward
and touches the side of your face.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.720
"There are those
who will be frightened of you.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.890
"But know what we do

01:15:31.890 --> 01:15:35.160
"is one of the most important gifts 
of all."

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
And she grabs your head, 
pulls you down,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.940
and kisses you on the forehead.

01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:46.000
At which point, suddenly your lungs 
fill once again with searing white pain.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
You find yourself scrambling about,

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.760
instinctually spilling out liquid
all around you,

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:55.500
and you finally (coughs) come out 
on top of the communion pool.

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:58.500
Your eyes open and you can see 
just red crimson pouring in your vision.

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:03.000
You rub it out
and you're in the chamber alone.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Eyes wide, swimming around,

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.000
you can see the figures on the side
come to the edges.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.610
They all bow.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.000
The figure that led you in

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
stands at the mouth of this pool
where you entered.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.500
She's smiling.
She has her hand extended.

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.000
LIAM: I take it.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.500
MATT: She lifts you out of the pool.

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:28.000
One of the other figures runs up

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.700
and takes
one of the dark robes that they have

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.200
and pulls it off around them,

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:37.000
revealing just a simple
dark blue and black outfit beneath.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Still wearing the veil,
but wraps the dark robe around you

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000
as the liquid is now
back to its freezing cold sensation.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Your teeth are chattering.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
They lead you back
to the door you entered,

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.500
down the stairs,
and into the central chamber

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.000
where both Keyleth and Pike await.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
You guys turn and see,
descending the stairs,

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.470
being flanked, essentially,

01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:05.000
by two of the members
of the Raven's Crest,

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000
both of the shoulders
with the dark robe wrapped around

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.000
a very cold and somewhat
freaked-out looking Vax'ildan,

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.620
who has smeared red across his face.

01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:21.000
His hair is thick
with viscous crimson liquid.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.370
ASHLEY: I run over.
You okay?

01:17:24.370 --> 01:17:28.030
MARISHA: I stand
at the bottom of the stairs and I watch.

01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:31.000
LIAM: (hoarsely)
I got answers in there,

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.770
but they led to more questions.

01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:37.000
What am I to do
with those questions?

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
MATT: The woman
who had led you in there

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
smiles and says,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
"That is the nature of death.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
"We can't have all the answers,
my friend.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
"It is the pursuit of those answers
that drives us.

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:54.000
"Do you trust Her?"

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.560
LIAM: I do.

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:02.000
MATT: "Then perhaps
you'll find those answers one day."

01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:08.860
LIAM: Thank you.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.300
MATT: "Thank you."

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.500
They pull the robe off

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.470
and they all head
back up into the chamber,

01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:21.000
leaving you all there
in the room alone.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.090
MARISHA: I walk over.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.270
ASHLEY: (whispering)
I'm just going to stay where he is.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.540
LIAM: I'm shell-shocked.

01:18:40.710 --> 01:18:42.710
MARISHA: You look well.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000
LIAM: It's going to be good.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.000
MARISHA: What did she say to you?
Did she speak to you at all?

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.530
LIAM: (whispering) Yeah.

01:18:59.530 --> 01:19:01.480
MARISHA: (shocked laugh)

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:03.300
LIAM: Do you speak?

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
ASHLEY: Yes?
LIAM: To her?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.750
ASHLEY: Sometimes.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.560
LIAM: Do you understand?

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000
ASHLEY: I don't think
any of us can fully understand.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000
I think, if we did,
then we would be gods.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.350
MARISHA: Do you believe?

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:50.160
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah. I do.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:56.850
I don't know what...
I don't know why, but...

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000
this was fate.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000
MARISHA: Is that what she told you,
that this was fate?

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
LIAM: No.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I know it here.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.320
MARISHA: Why?

01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:29.820
LIAM: Everything has led to it.

01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:35.990
You and I wouldn't be standing here
if my sister hadn't stolen a broom.

01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:39.850
Where's the sense in that?

01:20:39.850 --> 01:20:41.850
What else is it?

01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:53.000
I teleported into the stomach of a dragon
with a gnome

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
and I am still standing here.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
If it is not fate, what is it?

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.700
As someone
who is constantly questioning mine,

01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:15.160
I don't think
I'm the right person to ask.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
But I do know one thing--

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
and I grab his hands--

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:31.000
you were amazing
and talented and special

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
way before she found you.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000
If anything,
we can call her a god.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000
We can also call her
a great opportunist.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.420
She didn't give you
anything special.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.760
The Vax that I see before me right now

01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:01.000
is no different than the Vax
that I saw before me ten minutes ago.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.500
I'm not saying

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:15.000
that what you experienced
wasn't real and true.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.780
I believe you whole-heartedly.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
LIAM: This is real.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
This was meant to be.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000
And I am on board.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.800
MARISHA: Is it what was meant to be
or what you just really wanted?

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:42.000
And it found you?

01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:46.890
LIAM: (disbelieving laughter)

01:22:46.890 --> 01:22:49.890
It is not what I wanted.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Thank you. Thank you.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.270
I need to see my sister.

01:23:06.770 --> 01:23:09.000
And I head off towards the exit.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000
MATT: You guys make your way
to the outside of Raven's Crest.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.500
The doors open once again.

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:16.000
The figure that let you in
is waiting for you, opens the door.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.500
As you see the doors open--

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:20.000
LAURA: I jump up immediately.
I've bitten off all my fingernails.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
MATT: (laughs) Rushing down the stairs,
you see Pike, Keyleth,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
and your brother

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.410
in a little better spirits
than when he first entered,

01:23:28.410 --> 01:23:31.000
if a little damper and redder.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.500
LAURA: Is that blood?
Is that blood all over you?

01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:35.000
Did she hurt you?

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
LIAM: It was really weird, 
but it's fine.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
I told you I'd be fine, 
and I'm fine.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
LAURA: I get out a rag
and I start wiping everything off.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
(laughs) You're alive, though.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
LIAM: (laughs) Yeah,
doesn't make any sense, does it.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.500
LAURA: (laughing) Oh my god,
are you stronger now?

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.000
Are you so strong?

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
LIAM: I think I might be
a bit weaker, actually.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
LAURA: Oh, I don't believe it.
LIAM: I have the jelly-legs.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.500
LAURA: (laughs) Do you want
to ride Trinket for a while?

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.000
LIAM: Could I?
LAURA: Yes!

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000
LIAM: He's going to get sticky.
LAURA: No, he loves the taste of blood.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.360
MATT: (sad moaning)

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.500
LAURA: (laughs) Oh, Trinket.

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.000
MATT: Trinket comes over

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.860
and begrudgingly lowers himself
so you can climb on.

01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:11.500
LIAM: No, don't lick.
Don't lick.

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:14.000
LAURA: He's very light.
Scrawny, scrawny, scrawny.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
LIAM: But don't lick, Trink, please.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.390
MATT: (grunts)

01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:20.000
ASHLEY: Just one kiss?
One little lick?

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
LAURA: (laughs)

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
LIAM: Later, buddy. Later.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000
LIAM: I climb on top.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000
LAURA: Aren't you glad
you got out of the Pokeball for this?

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.990
LIAM: I give a quick look
back at my friends.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
and then I take a nap on Trinket.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.230
MATT: Okay.

01:24:44.230 --> 01:24:48.000
LAURA: So everything's good, then.
He's good? Everything's fine?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000
ASHLEY: I think so... I mean, it's--
it was very different,

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
but that doesn't mean it's wrong.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
LAURA: He talked to her?
MARISHA: He talked to her.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.500
LAURA: Were you there?
ASHLEY: No.

01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.000
MARISHA: They didn't let us 
in the room.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.140
LAURA: Oh. Well, I'll find out.

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.450
MARISHA: We stood outside.

01:25:04.450 --> 01:25:07.910
He didn't talk much about it.
Maybe you can find out more.

01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:12.000
All he said was
that he knows that this was fate.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
LAURA: Well, good.
He has a purpose.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.670
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:25:15.670 --> 01:25:18.750
MARISHA: Oh. Yeah.
Well, that's one way of looking at it.

01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:19.800
LIAM: (snores)

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:21.500
LAURA: I keep him steady
and I walk next to him.

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:22.500
MATT: Okay.

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.000
You guys eventually make your way
back to the Slayer's Take.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
The three of you guys...

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.500
what are you doing
while this is transpiring?

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.000
TRAVIS: Eating my mechanical pencil.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
(laughter)

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
TALIESIN: I've sent him
with a shopping list.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.500
MATT: Okay.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.000
What have they been sent to acquire?

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.370
TALIESIN: I'm going to need
a cheap gauntlet, some saddling straps,

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:45.000
three tankards, a pick-axe,
and two clocks.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000
MATT: All right.
How much gold do you give him?

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.220
LAURA: You've got--

01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:54.000
TALIESIN: That's right, I've got.

01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:02.000
SAM: Four gold.
TALIESIN: (snorts) I give--

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
LAURA: You've also got
a five-pound bag of gems, don't forget.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
TALIESIN: I do. I give him--

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.150
MARISHA: (giggles)

01:26:09.150 --> 01:26:11.000
TALIESIN: This is what happens.
MARISHA: Is that Riegel?

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.500
TALIESIN: That was Riegel.
MARISHA: (giggles)

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.430
TALIESIN: Don't read that.
That's not necessary.

01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:17.000
SAM: (singing) I drew a dick
on his picture.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
(laughter)

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
TALIESIN: And I need
that man's dick to finish the arm.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
MATT: That'll go over well.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
TALIESIN: Despite the dick on my page,

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I'm going to give Scanlan 100 gold
to take with Grog

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.000
to find some junk items
that they can put together.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.250
SAM: I'm going with Grog to shop?
All right, sure.

01:26:39.250 --> 01:26:40.770
TALIESIN: If you're down.

01:26:40.770 --> 01:26:43.000
SAM: Yeah. I'll do it.
Yeah, we'll go for all that stuff.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Do we find success?

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
MATT: I want you guys
to go ahead and roll--

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.650
actually, for you, just roll
a general charisma check

01:26:50.650 --> 01:26:53.000
to ask around and get people
to give you the proper information.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.500
TALIESIN: I love you.

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:56.000
SAM: What is this, just charisma?

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.500
MATT: You just add
your charisma modifier.

01:26:57.500 --> 01:26:59.000
SAM: 18.
MATT: 18?

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.790
MATT: Yeah, within a very brief period
of talking to the right people

01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:06.000
and smiling and getting folks
to listen back to you,

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
eventually you're given information

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.000
on where each piece of that list
is able to be found.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
They're not too crazy items.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
There's a lot in general stores,
general armor--

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
TALIESIN: I don't even need
an articulated gauntlet.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.500
It just needs to be a clamp.

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:24.000
MATT: Yeah, just a basic
clamp gauntlet.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
SAM: Do we also find a hat store?

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.150
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'd better.
LAURA: You want another beret?

01:27:29.150 --> 01:27:31.020
MATT: Not in the Braving Grounds,

01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:34.500
but you can definitely find one
on your journey in the Quad Roads.

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:36.000
SAM: If I can take

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.500
an extra side journey
to find a hat shop,

01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.000
that would be great.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.500
MATT: Do you go with him?

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:43.000
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
SAM: It's just hats, Grog.
We're just getting hats.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
MATT: You guys make your way
to the busy streets of the Quadroads.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.500
Eventually, asking around,

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:50.000
you find yourself 
across from what is called

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
the Sore Socket Haberdashery.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.380
SAM: The Sore Socket?
MATT: Sore Socket Haberdashery.

01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:55.630
TRAVIS: I love it.
SAM: I love it.

01:27:55.630 --> 01:27:57.580
MATT: And the picture outside

01:27:57.580 --> 01:28:01.000
has a caricature of a guy,
smiling, with a giant black eye.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
SAM: (laughs)

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
MATT: You walk inside and it's like

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:10.000
a small, localized bar--
not a tavern by any means,

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.500
but it has like
one small set-up in there

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:13.000
for just general beer,

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
and just loads and loads of hats.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Leathers, cloth,
all kinds of silly circumstances.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
You see some nice fancy hats
with big feather plumes.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.620
You see joking hats
that have multiple colors

01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:28.000
and what looks to be
bells hanging from them.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
As you step into the room,

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.040
you see two other random individuals
that are looking around, shopping,

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:34.000
and at the far end,

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.500
you see coming through
a big thing of curtains

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.000
what looks to be

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.000
a rather rotund woman
in her late 40s or so.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Big curls in her dark brown hair

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.620
and maybe a little too much makeup
on her face, who goes,

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:47.500
"Darlings, what are you looking for?

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.530
"What can I get you?
Are you looking for hats?"

01:28:49.530 --> 01:28:51.000
SAM: Oh, man.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
MATT: "I assume
you're looking for hats."

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
SAM: Wow. Yeah,
we've come to the right place.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
TRAVIS: The guys
are missing out on this one.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.500
(laughter)

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:03.730
SAM: Hi, ma'am.
My name's Scanlan. This is Grog.

01:29:03.730 --> 01:29:06.000
We're just-- I needed one hat,

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.190
but you have
such a fantastic selection,

01:29:08.190 --> 01:29:09.520
maybe we'll pick up a few.

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:13.000
SAM: How much money
do I have left over from his hundo?

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000
MATT: After all those materials,
I'd say probably,

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
asking around
and your high charisma,

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
you probably have about 60.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.500
TRAVIS: Bro, we got money.

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:24.000
SAM: Let's get some hats!

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.000
MATT: "My name is Deidre, dear,
so nice to meet you."

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
SAM: It's lovely to meet you.
MATT: "You're so adorable."

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.500
SAM: We've heard so much 
about this store.

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:34.000
MATT: "Really?"
SAM: Yes, far and wide.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.000
MATT: "Oh ho,
I can guarantee you, it's all true.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000
"And you, you're so big,
you're so strapping."

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
TRAVIS: I am.
MATT: "And that beard!"

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
MATT: She kind of tousles
the beard with her fingers.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
MATT: "(giggles)"
TRAVIS: (giggles) Oh, stop it.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.000
LAURA: Little food bits fall out.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.500
SAM: I'm here to buy
just one quick thing in particular,

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:53.000
then we'll be on our way.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
I just want a very tall hat.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Just very tall black hat 
with a point.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.760
MATT: "Tall.
Proportionally tall or regular?"

01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:03.000
SAM: Like a big triangle hat.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
MATT: "Hmm."

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:10.000
SAM: With a wide brim.
Like a wide black hat just like this.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000
MARISHA AND TRAVIS: (laugh)

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
MATT: She thinks for a second.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
"I don't carry anything like that--"

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.500
SAM: All right, well,
it was worth--

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:20.000
MATT: "But I can make you something

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.500
"if you don't mind waiting a bit."

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.620
SAM: I could come back for it
another day, perhaps.

01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:26.000
MATT: "Oh, but at least
let me measure your head, sweetie."

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
SAM: It's not for me.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000
MATT: "Do you know the size 
of who it's intended for?"

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.720
SAM: Well, her head's
a little bigger than mine.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000
MATT: "I'll make it adjustable!

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
"You have to pay
half in advance, a custom order."

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
SAM: Sure, how much?

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
MATT: "That will be 10 gold now,

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
"and an additional 10
upon retrieval."

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.500
SAM: More than worth it.
I'll take it.

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:52.000
MATT: "All right."

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.500
SAM: And also,
can you get something for him

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:55.470
that would really 
accentuate his features?

01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:57.270
TRAVIS: Me? What?
SAM: Yes, you need a hat.

01:30:57.270 --> 01:31:00.500
TRAVIS: Oh, this streamlined.
This is how the look goes.

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:02.000
SAM: But if it rains, Grog.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:06.000
TRAVIS: But that's part of it.
My muscles ripple in the moisture.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
MATT: "Nothing to block the muscles,
no, not at all,

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
"but I have to say,
with a fine, smooth head,

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
"it does need a little decoration,
if you don't mind me saying."

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.500
TRAVIS: Oh. You think so?
MATT: "(chuckles) You!"

01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:18.000
SAM: Something
in a yarmulke, perhaps?

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.500
MATT: "I was thinking--"

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:21.000
And she whips out what looks like

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
this fancy engraved leather cap
with two straps on the side

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.500
and just (shoomf) right over your head.

01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:28.410
It kind of folds everything in,

01:31:28.410 --> 01:31:30.000
the straps just go very long
and dangle there.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.500
LAURA AND ASHLEY: (laugh)
MARISHA: Yes! Yes!

01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:33.000
MATT: She takes them
and snaps them underneath

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
to where these two little danglies
are dangling from under the chin.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.500
And it just has
these really intricate flower patterns

01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:40.500
punched into the leather all around.

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.500
SAM: I love it, Grog.
I think you look great.

01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:44.000
TRAVIS: (stutters)
SAM: We don't have a mirror here?

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.500
MATT: "I think it speaks
of the seasons."

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.000
TRAVIS: Is it over my ears?

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
MARISHA: Is it like one of those
old-school leather helmets?

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.500
MATT: It looks almost
like the old football helmets.

01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:53.000
MARISHA: Oh, football!
Yeah. Okay! Cool.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.500
TRAVIS: I mean, I don't know,
does it do anything?

01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:57.380
MATT: "It looks masculine.
You wouldn't believe.

01:31:57.380 --> 01:31:58.500
"Here, let me show you!"

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:00.000
And she brings up a small mirror.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.500
TRAVIS: (screams)
(everyone else laughs)

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:03.000
MATT: "Exactly.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
"Men will fear you
walking down the road."

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.500
TRAVIS: No, please, more like--

01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:09.930
a bit more like war,
death, battlefield.

01:32:09.930 --> 01:32:12.500
More aggressive.
This is a bit more like sheep-herder.

01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:16.000
TRAVIS: Here you go.
MATT: "Well, all right."

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
MATT: "Death. Battle. Aggressive."
SAM: Maybe something with spikes?

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.000
MATT: "Spikes. Spikes...
let me see what I can do."

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
MARISHA, LAURA, AND ASHLEY: (laugh)

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
MATT: And she runs off down the way,
gets into a bag

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000
and you start hearing things going
(tink, thud) something rolls over--

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
"Ah, shit!"

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Eventually she comes out.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
"This is less of a hat
and more of a half-helmet,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.730
"but maybe it'll do."

01:32:39.730 --> 01:32:41.020
And she pulls forth

01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:43.000
what looks like
this very wide metal brim,

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
almost in a swish shape
to a point in the front.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.500
TRAVIS: (laughing) Conquistador's helmet?

01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:51.030
MATT: Yeah, it kind of looks
like a conquistador's helmet.

01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:53.000
But it's only the front,

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.500
so it's almost like
a rhinoceros horn

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:56.000
that sticks up to a point.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.500
MARISHA: Yes.
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.000
MATT: And the rest buckles
to the back of the head,

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
so it's a giant metallic groove
for the front.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.500
TRAVIS: I'll take it.
I don't even care if it fits.

01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:04.000
LIAM AND MARISHA: (laugh)

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.590
MATT: "Oh, that's what I like to hear."

01:33:06.590 --> 01:33:08.000
TRAVIS: How much is it?

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.500
MATT: "This will be 50 gold."
LAURA: (gasps)

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:12.000
TRAVIS: Is the point very sharp?

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
MATT: "Try it yourself."

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
TRAVIS: And I reach up
and I... hit it with my finger.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.500
MATT: It's all right.
It can be sharpened.

01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:20.000
It's more for decor.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
It's not meant
to slice somebody in half.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000
TRAVIS: Yeah, it could be sharpened?

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
MATT: "Well, I mean, what are you 
intending to do with this hat? (titters)"

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000
TRAVIS: Nothing, just look sharp.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
(groaning)

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000
MATT: "I can do that for you,
my big muscley man."

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.840
LIAM: That is the very ceiling
of intelligence of his.

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:43.050
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:46.000
TRAVIS: Oh, see that sweet jam 
I just dropped there.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.500
SAM: I did, that was a good line.
TRAVIS: Write that in a notebook somewhere.

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:52.000
TALIESIN: We'll be cleaning that
off the floor for ages.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
MATT: So after about five minutes or so,

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.500
she grinds down
with what materials she has

01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:58.000
to a little more--

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.540
it does mess with some of the polish
on the very tip of the metal,

01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:02.790
but it does come to a more solid point.

01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:05.000
"Be careful with that."

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.500
TRAVIS: So is it one piece
or is there a strap on the back

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:09.000
or it just goes (foonk)?

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
MATT: It goes on and then straps tight 
in the back to fit your head.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
TRAVIS: Beautiful.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.500
LAURA: It's basically like a unicorn?
MATT: Kind of.

01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:16.000
TRAVIS: Rhino.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
MATT: It's like a big old rhino horn
that curls upward to a point there.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
LIAM: Wow. Wow.
MATT: It looks a little ridiculous.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
MARISHA: I'm so excited for the art!

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000
TRAVIS: What do you think? Hold on.
What do you think?

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
SAM: Wow.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.000
I mean, your silhouette
is magnificent. Imposing.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.500
LIAM: Is this
your variant fighting costume?

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.000
ASHLEY: Oh, boy.
TRAVIS: Am I fearsome?

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.500
SAM: You are. You are.

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.000
We should go
to a silhouette artist after this

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
and get something drawn for this.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
TRAVIS: They have those?
SAM: They do, they cut it out.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.940
TRAVIS: Milady, you are
a master of your trade.

01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:44.000
ASHLEY: Oh, boy.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
MATT: "Well. So they tell me."

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000
SAM: Our mom only gave us
60 gold to spend.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Could you give us both hats for 60?
We're brothers.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.660
(laughter)

01:34:57.660 --> 01:35:01.000
SAM: Something 
went wrong with him at birth.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.710
MATT: Make a deception check
with disadvantage.

01:35:03.710 --> 01:35:04.920
SAM: With disadvantage?!

01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:08.000
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: Doesn't matter.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.580
SAM: Well, would a 1 be bad?

01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:12.000
(laughter)

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.500
MATT: Deidre goes,

01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:17.280
"(laughs) You silly, tiny man--

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:20.000
"No, seriously. We have a price 
agreed upon. Pay it."

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I got it.
I got 50 gold of my own.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.660
SAM: All right. 20 from me, 
50 from him. We'll take them both.

01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:28.000
MATT: "Ooh, all up front? All right.
It'll be ready for you shortly."

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.500
She takes the coin.

01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:31.160
"Thank you for the patronage.

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.000
"Return here in about...
ooh, an hour,

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.500
"and the hat
shall be prepared for you, sir--

01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.000
"what's your name?"

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
SAM: My name's Scanlan Shorthalt.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000
MATT: "Scanlan Shorthalt.
All right, come soon."

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
SAM: See you soon.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
TRAVIS: Can I hit my head
on the doorway on the way out?

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000
MATT: (shoomp)
LAURA AND MARISHA: (laugh)

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
MATT: (creak) You have to
kind of pull it out.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.500
Yeah. You leave a nice big groove.

01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:55.000
TRAVIS: It is nice, right?
MATT: Yeah.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.800
TRAVIS: Okay, good.

01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:00.500
MATT: (laughs) All right,
eventually you all gather again

01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:06.000
back at the hall of the Slayer's Take.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.000
You guys have just settled in

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.190
and are free to continue
any discussion you like

01:36:13.190 --> 01:36:19.000
as you see Scanlan and Grog come in.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:22.620
Say, you've since retrieved your hat

01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:26.000
with your various
wonderfully-crafted accoutrements.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.000
TRAVIS: 'Sup, bitches.
LAURA: Wow.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.500
SAM: Look at that.
ASHLEY: Whoa.

01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:32.000
TRAVIS: What happened?
SAM: Look at that.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
ASHLEY: (gasps) Ohh...
TRAVIS: I know, right? Wait for it.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
LIAM: (laughs)

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.000
LAURA: Whoa. Grog, you're so monstrous.
ASHLEY: What? Grog, that is so scary.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.500
MARISHA: That's like
another 12 inches to you.

01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:44.000
TRAVIS: I know.
MARISHA: You look so tall.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000
TRAVIS: It, like, changes
my whole battle strategy.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.450
I'm now literally
the point of the spear.

01:36:49.450 --> 01:36:54.050
ASHLEY: (gasps) You're so scary.
TALIESIN: How have we lived with this idiot?

01:36:54.050 --> 01:36:57.100
TRAVIS: (laughs) I'm a sea monster!
ASHLEY: (roars)

01:36:57.100 --> 01:37:00.160
TRAVIS: I'm like
the most wicked narwhal of all time!

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:02.600
Give me a pool! (laughs)

01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:05.000
ASHLEY: Can I try it on?
TRAVIS: Yeah, you want to?

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
TRAVIS: (laughing)
I put it on Pike's head.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.830
ASHLEY: Whoa, it's so heavy.

01:37:08.830 --> 01:37:11.790
(all but Taliesin laugh)
TALIESIN: What is the world coming to?

01:37:11.790 --> 01:37:13.220
TRAVIS: Is it as tall as she is?

01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:16.000
MATT: You can see
the bottom of her mouth.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
ASHLEY: Oh, Grog.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, look.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Wait, turn around 180 degrees
and then run as fast as you can.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, go!
Go! Go! Go, Pike! Go, go!

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
LAURA: (clapping) Go, Pike!
Go, Pike! Go, Pike!

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.310
TALIESIN: (groans)
EVERYONE ELSE: (laughs)

01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:38.000
ASHLEY: 9.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
MATT: 9. You go running
straight out of the door--

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.500
LAURA: No!

01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:43.620
MATT: You guys are like,
"Oh. No, Pike!"

01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:46.000
She's already out the door,
over the stairs

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
(repeated thuds),
outside of the hall.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.500
(sounds of dismay)

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:51.500
TRAVIS and LAURA: Oh no!

01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:53.000
ASHLEY: I'm okay!

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.500
MATT: You guys rush out to go catch her

01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:57.130
and the helmet is actually
embedded partway into the ground

01:37:57.130 --> 01:37:58.770
and she's kind of--

01:37:58.770 --> 01:38:00.000
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000
MATT: And she's just laughing.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
ASHLEY: (laughing) Grog,
get me out of this helmet.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
TRAVIS: I pick her up by the feet.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.470
TRAVIS: That was excellent. (giggles)

01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:13.850
ASHLEY: As he's holding me up like that
I try to stab him with it.

01:38:15.710 --> 01:38:19.000
TRAVIS: I yank it off of her head
and put her back on the ground.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.230
LIAM: Vax has been
laughing hysterically,

01:38:21.230 --> 01:38:24.000
giggle fits,
clutching his ribs the entire time.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000
And then is there
any of the staff here?

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Anyone that's here? Anyone else?

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000
MATT: You haven't seen Mertin.
Vanessa doesn't seem to have left.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.500
LIAM: What about underlings?

01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:36.000
MATT: I mean, there are

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.500
a few individuals here
that are part of the guildhall.

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:41.000
The hierarchy here
is more like the few that run it,

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
and then everyone else
comes and goes as they please.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.580
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, come here, you.
Do you have a tub?

01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:48.660
Do you have a bath? Look at me.
Do you have a bath? I need a bath.

01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:50.000
MATT: "You look pretty rough."

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
LIAM: Yeah?

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.500
MATT: "Yeah. We could--

01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:54.720
"we got a washroom in the back,
if you need it."

01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:58.000
LIAM: Is it hot?
I feel like I need it to be hot.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
MATT: "You get what you get. 
It's water, buddy."

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.500
LIAM: Okay.
That's perfect, thank you.

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:03.000
Grog, put that hat on again.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:08.000
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, hold on. (foomp)
LIAM: (laughs hysterically)

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.500
LIAM: All the way down the hall
to take a bath.

01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:11.000
SAM: It's crazy. Did you guys
get him drunk or something?

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.500
TALIESIN: I don't know
what you people did, but...

01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:14.000
ASHLEY: Well, he just...

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.500
TRAVIS: People respond to fear differently.

01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:17.000
SAM: I guess so.
LAURA: He's gone insane.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.500
MARISHA: He might have saw
the face of a god.

01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:21.920
SAM: Whatever.
TRAVIS: He did?

01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:23.470
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:25.500
ASHLEY: Yeah. The head of--

01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:28.000
TRAVIS: By the way,
why is he covered in bloodbath?

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
ASHLEY: I think that was part of the--

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
MARISHA: Ritual? Communion?

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
ASHLEY: Getting to know his new god.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
TRAVIS: Did he kill a lot of people?

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.500
ASHLEY: Maybe he had to. I don't know.

01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:40.000
TRAVIS: He did?
LAURA: So many, Grog.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.500
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
LAURA: Yeah. It was a giant battle.

01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:44.300
TRAVIS: Like, how many on two hands?

01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:47.140
LAURA: Like at least this many.

01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:51.000
TRAVIS: That's a legendary amount.
LAURA: That's more than six.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.200
LAURA: I know.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:55.000
LIAM: Somewhere deep in the building,
far away:

01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:00.000
LIAM: This is not hot!

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
MATT: The gruff individual chuckles.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
"Heh. It never is."

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.000
I need you to make a tinkering check.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000
I'm sitting with my tea and my tools,
trying to ignore these people.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.060
LAURA: Can I heat water up
in the fireplace?

01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:16.620
MATT: Yeah, yeah,
it'll take you a little while.

01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:19.000
TALIESIN: Please don't explode.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
SAM: When I delivered
the materials to him--

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
TALIESIN: Oh, Jesus H. Fucking Christ.
MARISHA: Oh no, Taliesin...

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
SAM: Could I have inspired him at all,
when I delivered the materials?

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.500
TALIESIN: Please.
MATT: Sure.

01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:30.000
SAM: All right.
MARISHA: Please inspire.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.320
SAM: I will inspire--
oh my god, it's not even worth it.

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:36.750
TALIESIN: (muffled) Please inspire.
Do it. Do it, you bloody gnome!

01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:38.460
SAM: Okay.
So when I delivered everything,

01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:42.000
I just sang him a little song
to inspire him. And I sang,

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:46.000
SAM: (singing) 
Percy's gun, won't you come

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.630
and kill up all the dragons?

01:40:49.630 --> 01:40:55.500
(others join in) Percy's gun,
won't you come, won't you come?

01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:57.000
ASHLEY AND LIAM: Percy's gun!

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
(laughter)

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
MATT: Oh my god.
All right, take your d10.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.500
LAURA: Ten! Ten! Ten!
LIAM: Do it! Do it!

01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:04.000
MARISHA: Oh my god, it's a 10!
TALIESIN: Better!

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.500
SAM: That was a 10.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.000
MARISHA: I get excited. Sorry.
LIAM: Pretty good song.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.500
TALIESIN: Proficiency,
tinkering, plus the--

01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:11.000
MATT: Well, your proficiency
is what you get with the roll

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
and then it's your dex bonus.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:17.000
TALIESIN: Okay, so proficiency,
dex, okay, thank you, god.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
TALIESIN: (muttering) That's 11...
LIAM: (hums Black Hole Sun)

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
TALIESIN: 23.
MATT: 23. What did you roll naturally?

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.500
SAM: A 2.
TALIESIN: 2.

01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:24.000
LIAM: (laughs)
LAURA: Whoa.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.860
SAM: Plus 10.
MATT: Ah.

01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:27.000
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: Plus 10.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
TALIESIN: Made it 12.
MATT: Wow. All righty.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
TALIESIN: It's not complicated,
but I've got a good design,

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.000
and it has two nifty things.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.500
MATT: What are the nifty things?

01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:37.000
SAM: Fingers.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.500
TALIESIN: It doesn't actually
have fingers.

01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:42.000
It's a mitt piece, strap-on,

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000
it can lock the thumb
and lock the hand

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
so you can open it, lock,
close it, lock.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
It's got little flip-locks.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000
MATT: Mm-hm.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
TALIESIN: You can detach the hand

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.690
and put a pick spike on
for mining. Like a mining punch.

01:41:54.690 --> 01:41:56.320
LIAM: Is it like Young Frankenstein?

01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:58.000
(mechanical sound effects)

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.500
TALIESIN: It's more Dustin Hoffman "Hook",
but, you know.

01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:04.000
MARISHA: Oh, sure.
LAURA: Oh, that's nice.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.500
MARISHA: I was thinking
Go-Go-Gadget Finger.

01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.000
TALIESIN: Because it's got
the click, pull, click.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000
MATT: Right.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.500
TALIESIN: I can do it
with all these things.

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:13.000
I can graph it. So.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000
MATT: (laughs)

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
TALIESIN: Reasonable.
It's not pretty.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.500
MATT: It takes you a few hours

01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:19.000
and gets you into
the early parts of the evening,

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:25.000
but you do manage
to go ahead and complete it.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000
You manage to get it finished up

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000
and you're pretty proud of your work,
actually, and you feel--

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.450
the whistle you're still doing
as you do the final bits,

01:42:33.450 --> 01:42:35.000
you realize is the song
that Scanlan sang for you,

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.500
just looping in your head.

01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:38.000
It happened to push you
through your work

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.500
and get your final piece completed.

01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:42.320
TALIESIN: I also carved
a little message inside

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:45.000
that will not matter
unless it actually becomes pertinent.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.000
MATT: Okay.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.780
TALIESIN: You don't get to know
until you ask offscreen.

01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:50.970
SAM: You don't know.
LAURA: (laughs) Ohhh.

01:42:50.970 --> 01:42:52.170
MATT: Okay. I'm excited. Okay.

01:42:52.170 --> 01:42:53.820
MARISHA: That's right, DM.
TRAVIS: That never happens.

01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:58.100
MATT: (laughs) Try me. Okay.
Do you go and deliver it?

01:42:58.100 --> 01:42:59.920
TALIESIN: I do go and deliver it.

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:03.000
MATT: Okay.
As the sun begins to set in Vasselheim,

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.910
you make your way back over
to the Braving Grounds,

01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:11.000
which as you look across, too,
as the night goes dark,

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.420
the Braving Grounds itself
has a whole different life to it.

01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:18.020
There are so many forges
and smelters going that there's--

01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:20.200
most buildings have
this bright orange glow

01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:22.190
through the ceiling
and these various openings

01:43:22.190 --> 01:43:25.000
where fumes and smoke and exhaust
are sent up

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000
from the various
production constructs and such.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000
It has this very luminescent look
in comparison to a lot of the city.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.190
It's very interesting.

01:43:33.190 --> 01:43:36.000
It reminds you of the deep,
deep portions of Kraghammer,

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:41.000
where most of
the actual fire and melted rock

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:45.000
was being smelted
and gathered and heated.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
So you make your way to the hovel.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.410
The roof workers are no longer there,
and the door is closed.

01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:58.000
TALIESIN: (knocks) Victor?
I've got your hand.

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:02.000
MATT: "(muffled) I'm sleeping."

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
TALIESIN: Do you want your hand?

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
MATT: "(muffled) You want me to sleep?"

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.270
TALIESIN: I don't see why
they're mutually exclusive.

01:44:10.270 --> 01:44:12.000
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
MATT: You hear (scraping sound)
a bunch of different locks fiddling.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
(series of clicks) (fwoosh)

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
And the door opens
and you see Victor,

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
clean-faced for the first time
you've really seen him before,

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
and he has a nightcap

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.500
which sort of (foomf)
in front of his face,

01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:25.000
with a little puffball at the end.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000
He's like,

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.010
"I told you.
I was trying-- oh! Hey.

01:44:29.010 --> 01:44:32.000
"(hesitantly) Percival?"

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.590
TALIESIN: Yes, that's quite good.
I love your hat.

01:44:34.590 --> 01:44:36.500
MATT: "Thank you.
It's comfy to sleep in."

01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:38.330
TALIESIN: It looks it.
MATT: "Did you bring my hand?"

01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:40.860
TALIESIN: I did. I grabbed your hand
and I will show you.

01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:42.190
It is very special.

01:44:42.190 --> 01:44:43.500
MATT: "Come in! Come in! (grunts)"

01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.000
And opens the door.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.500
You see he's wearing
this long nightgown

01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:48.000
that is covered in patches
and tears in it.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Most of it
has been turned black through soot,

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
but the cap is perfect.
Perfect condition.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.500
TALIESIN: I have a special
set of pajamas myself, so I understand.

01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:57.000
MATT: "They are comfortable."

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000
As he walks in,
still bandaged on the arm,

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
you can see there's

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.000
a small kettle of tea
set by the small fireplace right there.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.530
It's a tiny little table
and a tiny little stool

01:45:08.530 --> 01:45:11.000
that he's just kind of
sitting on right there.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.490
And he goes
and he reaches over for the kettle.

01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:15.370
"(groans)"

01:45:17.690 --> 01:45:19.640
Tries to pick up the cup
and just pours the tea into it.

01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:20.650
TALIESIN: (alarmed stuttering)

01:45:20.650 --> 01:45:23.900
TALIESIN: I'm going to stop
and attach and begin strapping this.

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.000
MATT: "(confused stuttering)"

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
TALIESIN: Let me show you. 
It attaches like this.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000
MATT: "Ooh."

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000
TALIESIN: Here are the two switches.
(clicking)

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000
And for your mine.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
MATT: "Eh? Oh."

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.500
TALIESIN: I grab,
hit the button, twist, pull.

01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:39.680
MATT: "Oh? Eh? I just got that!"

01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:43.000
TALIESIN: And I get the spike
and attach it.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.000
MATT: "Oh."

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
TALIESIN: Remove it,
put the hand back on.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Tea?

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.990
MATT: (chuckle, click)

01:45:52.990 --> 01:45:58.000
(excited laughter) "Tea?"

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.000
TALIESIN: Sure. Why not?
Always say yes.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.000
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.500
MATT: "Need another cup. (grunts)"

01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:07.000
He stands up and goes over,

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.500
still holding the kettle
and splashing everywhere,

01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:11.000
and he's flipping through cabinets
and knocking pieces of glass out.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
"Ah! Found it."

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Pulls out another little ceramic cup

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:22.000
and pours the tea in,
sets it down. (chink, click)

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
"(cackles)"

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000
SAM: (laughs)

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000
MATT: "To new hands!"
TALIESIN: To new hands.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
SAM: That's a great toast.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.000
MATT: It is pungent. It is bitter.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000
MATT: It has been steeped way too long.
ASHLEY: Gunpowder tea.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.000
MATT: But it definitely
cleans out the sinuses.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.290
And there is a hint of gunpowder
to the flavoring.

01:46:44.290 --> 01:46:46.500
You get the sense
that pretty much everything in this room

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:48.000
is marinated in some way,
shape, or form

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.500
to be flammable.

01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:52.000
TALIESIN: (hoarsely) Victor.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
(laughter)

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
MATT: "It can put hair on your balls."

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.000
TALIESIN: Ohhh, probably.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Has a woman been by
to buy black powder?

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:09.000
(coughs) Has a woman been by?

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.500
MATT: "Not in, uh, weeks, maybe."

01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:14.000
TALIESIN: Weeks?

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.500
MATT: "Did you make her hand, too?"

01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:20.000
TALIESIN: I did not.
Do you know where she goes?

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.470
MATT: "No. She paid well, though."

01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:24.000
TALIESIN: Did she? What did she pay?

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000
MATT: "Are you guys in a club now?
How many people want black powder?

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
"Tell me! Tell them!
Bring them more.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.500
"I could use money."

01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:36.000
(others laugh)

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:44.000
TALIESIN: How much black powder
did she buy, Victor?

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:50.000
MATT: "Uh... (mutters to himself)"
(click, click)

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
TALIESIN: Only counts to two.
I'm so sorry.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000
(laughter)

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:00.970
MATT: "Maybe... 12 hogsheads worth?"

01:48:00.970 --> 01:48:02.780
ASHLEY: Whoa.
TRAVIS AND MARISHA: Oh, shit.

01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:07.000
TALIESIN: Really?
And how often does she come by?

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
MATT: "She only come by once."

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:12.000
TALIESIN: Okay. (sighs)

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Thank you. I'm so pleased.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.310
I may stop by one last time
before I leave town,

01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:22.000
just to say goodbye. Thank you.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
MATT: "Please do! I have more tea.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:30.000
"Many different flavors.
This is, I call, dark roast."

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000
TALIESIN: It...
certainly scalded something.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Thank you. That was very lovely
and that was very charming

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
and I unfortunately have business in the--

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
MATT: "I want to try the other one
before you go."

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
TALIESIN: One more
and then I must go, thank you.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.000
MATT: "(click, creak)
Come on, need this, too."

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:52.000
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.
MATT: "(creak, click) (cackles)"

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000
TALIESIN: (uncertain laughter)

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000
MATT: (thunk) He sticks it 
into the wooden stool and the table.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Kind of breaks the wood
and snaps it.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.000
"Oh. (cackles)"

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:09.000
TALIESIN: Remember
that it's attached to bone.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.000
You can still break your arm,
so be gentle.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.500
MATT: "Yes. Thank you!"

01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:15.000
TALIESIN: Thank you. Good night!
Have a lovely evening.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.260
MATT: "Good night!"
SAM: Aah.

01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:20.500
TALIESIN: Good night.
Aah. Pleasure, as always.

01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:22.000
Thank you.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000
MATT: "(slurps)"

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.500
TALIESIN: I leave
in a little bit of a panic.

01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:27.000
MATT: You leave
and he's just sitting there

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
staring
at this long chisel point, going,

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.000
"(quiet cackling)"

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.680
SAM: His ring.
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:38.000
MATT: The door
slowly closes behind you.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.500
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LIAM: A fighter is born.

01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:41.560
MARISHA: Yes, yeah,
just give him an anime weapon.

01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:45.000
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay.
We're sticking around for a day?

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.500
SAM: I assume so. I don't know.

01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:49.000
We're going to spend the night,
at least.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000
TALIESIN: I'm going to take
a long walk before I come back

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
and I'm going to walk by
the Raven Queen temple

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:58.000
and just... peek inside.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.000
MATT: Okay.
You make your way past the Quad Roads.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.330
At this point at night
the whole clientele has shifted.

01:50:06.330 --> 01:50:09.300
Most people coming here--
you hear laughter, you hear music.

01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:15.000
The Quad Roads is the New Orleans 
of the town, comparatively.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
It's still nowhere near as rambunctious
as many places you've been,

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
but for what seems during the day

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:23.000
to be a rather dour
and serious business type city,

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
the Quad Roads
is where the celebration of humanity hits

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.500
when the evening hours hit.

01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:28.000
So you come by

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
and there's some taverns
that are open.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.000
You see, to a certain extent,

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.000
what even appears to be
an adult entertainment district.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
LAURA: (laughs sarcastically)

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.500
MATT: You make your way beyond--

01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:43.400
LIAM: (clears throat)
Ring-a-ding-ding.

01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:46.000
MATT: It's the oldest profession.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.000
You make your way all the way
to the outskirts of the Duskmeadow,

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
and there, amongst the

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:55.000
just barely peeking
through the cloudline starlight,

01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:00.000
the looming dark structure
that is Raven's Crest.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000
TALIESIN: I'm just going to
gently open the door

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.470
and peek inside
and see if anybody's inside.

01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:12.000
MATT: Okay. You go ahead
and push the door open. (creak)

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.240
Doesn't appear to be anybody there.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:24.000
TALIESIN: I walk in just for a moment
and take a look around.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.000
MATT: Okay. You walk in.
(clicking footsteps)

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:33.000
At this dark hour, looking around,
the obsidian-type walls

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
are translucent glass
on the other side,

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.500
though you can barely make out
through the material

01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:38.000
the details of the outside world,

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.290
due to the lack of light
across the cityscape.

01:51:40.290 --> 01:51:41.700
Especially here in Duskmeadow,

01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:46.000
in which the magical lantern light
that illuminates the city streets

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:49.940
are relatively sparse
on this side of Vasselheim.

01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:55.000
You take a few more steps in,
(clicking footsteps)

01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:00.000
footsteps echoing across the long,
thin, dark material of the floors.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.000
(creak, thud)

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
LAURA: (gasps)
MATT: Door closes behind you.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.000
TRAVIS: (quietly) What would--
why would you do this?

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000
LIAM: Said the T. rex.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
TALIESIN: I'm going to
gently look around

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:18.000
and slowly back up
and see if I can see anyone.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:24.000
TALIESIN: Hello? Hello?

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:28.000
MATT: (echoing) Hello...
hello... hello.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
TALIESIN: What do I have to pay
to fix this?

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.213
MATT: (echoing) This...
this... this... this.

01:52:52.453 --> 01:52:53.786
TALIESIN: I leave.

01:52:53.786 --> 01:52:55.750
MATT: (thump-crash)
You hear the sound

01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:58.000
of some sort of low,
distant hit and a rumble,

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:02.500
and you see a distant light appear
in a chamber just beyond the walkway,

01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:04.000
just faint enough to illuminate

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000
and give the presence
of some sort of life or movement

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000
about a hundred or so feet ahead of you.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
TALIESIN: I walk briskly towards it.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.500
MATT: You enter the next chamber,

01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:21.000
where you see the interior
of this structure

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:26.500
is ivory-white bone and glass,
with a blue hint,

01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:28.000
very much resembling the interior

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:34.000
of a very naturally,
beautifully-carved ice cavern.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.500
There is a stairway that ascends,

01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:37.000
as well as other hallways
that lead out

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
from the central nerve center

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:43.000
of the lower floor
of the main structure.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.000
As you walk into this central chamber,

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.000
you see, ever so faintly,
at the very top of the stairs,

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:53.000
a pair of feet (footsteps)
walk and disappear up the stairs.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
TALIESIN: I'm going to 
charge after them.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.960
MATT: Okay. You go running
up the stairway. (thud thud)

01:53:56.960 --> 01:54:00.000
You get to the top, and you can see
at the very top of the stairs

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.210
a dark wooden door
with a dark iron rim

01:54:04.210 --> 01:54:05.480
and what appears to be

01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:09.610
a large hanger or handle
or knocker bolted to it

01:54:09.610 --> 01:54:12.000
and it (thud) just closes

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.000
as you come underneath
the top of the archway and up the stairs.

01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:25.000
TALIESIN: I knock.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.000
MATT: (doosh) Once?

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
TALIESIN: Three times.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
MATT: (doosh doosh)
With each hit,

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.000
you can hear the reverberation
of the echo of the knock

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.000
through a much larger chamber beyond.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:44.000
As soon as you release
the actual door knocker,

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:50.000
the door (thump-crash, creak)

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:55.000
just creaks open ever so slightly
into a very, very dark chamber.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:59.000
You can see very, very little in here,
other than the basic outline

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.000
of what looks to be
a little bit of floor,

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.500
some sort of a smooth,
glassy surface

01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:07.000
that refracts
just a little bit of light

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
that makes it through
what looks to be

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:14.000
some sort of broken-up
glass dome-type structure above you.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:17.850
You can't make out much beyond that.
It's very dark in here.

01:55:19.890 --> 01:55:26.260
TALIESIN: Hello? Please. (sighs)

01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:30.000
Something terrible has happened.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.500
I don't understand how these games work.

01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:36.000
I need help to fix something.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Something terrible has happened!

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.500
You obviously
care little for this world.

01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:56.000
I start to back out.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.560
MATT: As you step out of the room,
you hear a whisper

01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:03.000
come from beyond the chamber,
within the darkness. It says,

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.000
"Is it yourself
you wish to fix or something more?"

01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:13.640
TALIESIN: I don't think I can be fixed.

01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:16.000
There is something broken in the world.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
MATT: "Then come. Let us talk."

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.760
TALIESIN: ...I don't understand
how these things work.

01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:33.000
I'm so sorry. 
Where do you wish me to go?

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.500
MATT: "Have faith."

01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:37.000
TALIESIN: (disbelieving laugh)

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000
MATT: "Step in. Join me."

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:47.000
TALIESIN: (sighs) ...I strip.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
TRAVIS: (gasps)

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
TALIESIN: And put it aside.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.000
SAM: Put "it" aside?

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.500
TALIESIN: Put my clothes
in the corner.

01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:55.000
SAM: Oh.
You're gonna jump her, eh?

01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:00.000
TALIESIN: You're filthy.
And I go into the pool.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
MATT: All right.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:06.500
As you step into the chamber,
freezing cold as your toes--

01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:08.000
TALIESIN: We're cold people.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.480
MATT: Your legs, your whole body
eventually finds itself

01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:18.000
stepping into this thick,
freezing liquid.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
You hear the whisper in your ears

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
just as your head
reaches the level of the blood,

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.520
that says,

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:31.760
"Come. Come to me with your questions."

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Just as your head goes
beneath the surface.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000
TALIESIN: (sighs) We're doing this.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:45.000
MATT: You're underneath
and in darkness,

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
feeling around the thick material,

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.000
kind of just
swishing your fingers around,

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.500
but amongst the liquid,

01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:55.000
you still hear the whisper again
in your ear:

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:59.000
"Come. Bring your questions."

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:04.000
TALIESIN: And I swim down
until it's uncomfortable.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:08.740
MATT: You swim downward
and you touch the bottom of the pool.

01:58:08.740 --> 01:58:13.880
You reach a somewhat concave,

01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:16.630
smooth floor to the pool.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
TALIESIN: I'm going to
head to the surface.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.500
I don't know what's...

01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:26.000
MATT: You head to the surface.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
There's no surface.
It just keeps going.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:32.000
TALIESIN: (sighs)
I do not do well with this.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.000
MATT: You do not.
You begin to panic.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.500
TALIESIN: Yes, I do.

01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:38.000
MATT: You begin to reach around

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.500
and try to swim up
and find the surface,

01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:40.500
but it just keeps going.

01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:42.000
The liquid's thick
and it's hard to pull through,

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.500
and you can't open your eyes,
and you can't see anything,

01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:45.000
and the iron-like flavor

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:48.000
is starting to find its way
to the inside of your mouth

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:52.000
as it's seeping through your nose
and your ears.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.000
You begin to panic even further
as the cold is starting to take

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
and you feel your muscles
beginning to shake and seize

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
from the onset of hypothermia.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
You begin to head
to the bottom of the pool again,

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.620
and this time,
you crack your head on the bottom

01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:06.420
in the middle of your stupor,
and you reach up and scream in pain.

01:59:06.420 --> 01:59:10.010
As you do, the blood fills your lungs
and you begin to feel yourself drown.

01:59:10.010 --> 01:59:11.500
You begin to shake and convulse

01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:13.000
as you begin to try to find a way
to force it out of your body

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
and you can't.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:16.000
And at that moment,

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.000
where all of a sudden
you realize that this is it.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.700
This is the end.

01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:24.460
This is how the tale of Percival
comes to an end.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.000
The sensation goes warm again.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:33.000
And it's like all that cold energy
goes away,

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:37.000
and you're now swimming in water,
then air,

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:42.000
and the pain subsides,
and you're breathing normally.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:46.000
But you still stand in darkness,
and you hear these distant footsteps.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:50.000
(clicking footsteps) Sourceless.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.000
No light, just shadow.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:55.500
And you look around 
over your shoulder

01:59:55.500 --> 01:59:57.000
and then right behind you,
you see immediately

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
a white porcelain face,

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:04.000
the head is just standing there
amongst the shadow.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
TALIESIN: (takes deep breaths)
Do you know what I've done?

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:12.000
MATT: "I've watched."

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.000
TALIESIN: I have questions.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
MATT: "Then ask them."

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:31.450
TALIESIN: First is, can we stop it?

02:00:31.450 --> 02:00:35.000
Can we stop what's been released?

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
Is there something I can do?

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.000
MATT: "Many things
are released in this world.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.980
"Many terrible, many wonderful.
Many things.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
"Ask the right questions."

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.550
TALIESIN: Did it choose me
because I was broken,

02:00:57.550 --> 02:00:58.980
or did it break me?

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.960
MATT: The mask, which has not shown
any expression at this point,

02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:09.000
pulls back a little bit from you
and almost seems to grow in size.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
It's strange;

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.000
the proportion seems to stay the same,
but suddenly your vision shifts

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.000
and you realize, no,

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:19.000
it's farther away from you
and is just suddenly immense,

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
like your visual focus just changes

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
and your whole perspective
suddenly causes you

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.000
to lose sense of scale and balance.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:30.000
The voice comes in,
this time louder:

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:34.000
"You were always broken, Percival.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:40.000
"And you were preyed upon,
just as it preys upon others,

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.000
"and will continue to do so
until finally destroyed."

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.000
TALIESIN: Can it be fixed?

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
MATT: "Perhaps.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:58.000
"Your deeds will guide your path
to salvation or damnation.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.000
"The choice is yours.
You skirt that line still."

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:06.000
TALIESIN: But the first deed is so...

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:12.000
there's so much,
and I don't think any of them see it.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:19.000
I want it to die
before anybody sees it.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Can you help?

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.520
MATT: "I've already helped, Percival.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
"Do not think the path
that you and your allies walk

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:31.000
"goes unseen.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.000
"There are many of those in this world
that represent the will of us,

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.000
"just as there are those
who represent the will

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.000
"of those that combat us
and always have.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:50.000
"There are a great many deeds
ahead of you.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.000
"It's your choice to take them.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:03:00.000
"Just know:
should you not watch yourself,

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.000
"you may not find yourself
on our side."

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.000
TALIESIN: I know.

02:03:11.460 --> 02:03:15.460
There is nowhere 
I can look for healing?

02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:18.840
Other than deeds?

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.560
I like to fix things.

02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:29.530
MATT: "All life is inherently 
broken from the start, Percival.

02:03:29.530 --> 02:03:32.110
"Take solace in that.

02:03:32.110 --> 02:03:35.000
"There is no perfection in life.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.290
"Otherwise, what would be 
the purpose of death?

02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:43.000
"It's to try to find ways
to better yourself before the end

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.110
"that gives us purpose.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:52.180
"You are all broken,
but also understand,"

02:03:52.180 --> 02:03:57.000
At this point, her voice 
gets very deep and very resonant.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:00.000
"Mortals can achieve great things.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:03.000
"I did."

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
And the mask pulls back
into the shadows

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.500
and suddenly (gasp, cough)

02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:10.170
you begin coughing,
finding your way to the surface,

02:04:10.170 --> 02:04:13.000
pouring blood out of your mouth
and coughing

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
and eventually you find your way over,
breathing heavily,

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:18.000
to the side of the pool and (grunt)
pull yourself onto the side.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.500
(cough) Cough the rest of it up.

02:04:19.500 --> 02:04:22.090
A little bit of moonlight peeks through,
and you can see

02:04:22.090 --> 02:04:26.000
the beams refracting through
the purples and reds and blues

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.930
and just hints of specks of light

02:04:29.930 --> 02:04:31.540
that just shimmer
across the surface

02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:33.450
of this dark,
glass-like floor.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.000
TALIESIN: I'm going to take my sword

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000
and I'm going to very carefully
scrape my body clean of the blood,

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000
as much as I can,

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.000
and I'm going to take
the back of my shirt

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.000
and clean my hair off
as much as I can.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.000
I'm going to take
a vial of the blood in the pool.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.000
One tiny bit.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.440
MATT: You do so.

02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:07.220
TALIESIN: I'm going to
put my clothes back on...

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:16.000
and I'm going to cast Hex on myself
for my walk home

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:19.000
and banish it
before I come in the door.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:25.000
MATT: Okay. All righty.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:29.000
So, as Percival finally wanders in,

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:30.000
is there anything else
anyone wants to achieve

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.000
before the evening's done?

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:32.500
SAM: I'd like to go to the Raven Queen.

02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:37.000
(laughter)

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:38.000
SAM: No.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.000
LIAM: Are we next morning,

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:40.500
or we're still evening,
at this point?

02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:42.000
MATT: We're still evening 
at the moment,

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.500
if there's anything else
you wish to achieve. Otherwise--

02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:44.500
LAURA: I've been slowly heating water

02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:46.000
and giving it to Vax
to put in his bath.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:47.140
MATT: You do manage

02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:50.220
to draw a comfortable bath
for your brother and wash him clean.

02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:52.030
LAURA: I don't wash him!

02:05:52.030 --> 02:05:54.000
I just give him the fucking water.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.500
MATT: You aid him in washing 
himself clean. So you specify.

02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:59.000
LIAM: Thanks, man.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.500
TRAVIS: Do we see Percy
when he comes in?

02:06:01.500 --> 02:06:03.000
MATT: It's going to be late.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.500
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk quiet and late

02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:06.000
and go tinker
on a little thing for a minute

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
until I pass out.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
MATT: Okay.
You do notice Percy enter.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Looks a little frazzled,
but doesn't seem to--

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:15.530
LAURA: Do I see any of the blood?
Passive perception?

02:06:15.530 --> 02:06:17.000
LIAM: You're in 
the tubby town, though.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:18.790
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:22.330
I want you to make 
a dexterity check.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
MARISHA AND TALIESIN: (groan)

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
LIAM: Sorry, Taliesin.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
SAM: You've got him.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:32.740
LIAM: Rolled high.
LAURA: 32.

02:06:32.740 --> 02:06:34.120
TALIESIN: 32?!

02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:36.730
Oh my god, what the--
I couldn't have rolled that.

02:06:36.730 --> 02:06:38.300
Like, that would've been 
a natural 20,

02:06:38.300 --> 02:06:40.000
would have been 
the only way around that.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:43.000
MATT: You see, just faintly 
behind one of his ears

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:47.000
and at the edge of his collar
on his coat,

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:54.000
just a bit of familiar crimson,
and a look of...

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
a distant stare that is familiar.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.660
MATT: All right.

02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:05.500
Do you all wish to rest
for the evening?

02:07:05.500 --> 02:07:09.000
SAM: No, I would like
to take 12 hours to read my book.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
MATT: Okay, so the first 12 hours 
are completed,

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.000
but you do not sleep?

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:13.000
SAM: No.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
LIAM: It's a page-turner.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
SAM: Lots of centerfolds.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.420
(laughter)

02:07:19.420 --> 02:07:21.500
TRAVIS: Don't be stingy,
share those with me.

02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:23.000
MATT: Written by John Cleese.
It's a wonderful piece.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:26.000
LAURA: I also spend
a lot of time that night reading,

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
but I'm reading
the book about the Raven Queen.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:29.700
MATT: Okay.

02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:32.200
LAURA: Pretty much
have it memorized at this point.

02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:35.000
MATT: Yeah, fair enough. All right.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.110
You guys all find yourself to rest,
except for Scanlan,

02:07:37.110 --> 02:07:38.500
who takes
a point of exhaustion

02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:40.000
for going through the night
without sleep.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:41.000
SAM: I don't know what that is,
but someone will tell me.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:42.000
TRAVIS: You'll find out.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
MATT: Yeah. Basically,
it means any ability checks,

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
any skill checks
until you get a full night's rest

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.410
are at disadvantage, yeah.

02:07:48.410 --> 02:07:50.870
All right, as you find yourselves to rest,
most of you

02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:53.000
the morning light comes, 
greeting you to a new day,

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000
and we're going to go ahead
and take a break.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.500
We'll be back here
in a few minutes, guys.

02:07:55.500 --> 02:07:59.000

We'll be back here in a minute, guys.

02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:09.000
MARISHA: And get your Joe Mad poster!
MATT: Joe Mad poster!

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:10.000
MARISHA: Right now, pre-order.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.000
SAM: Wait, there's a giveaway
at the break, I think.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.000
LAURA: Oh, there's
a Loot Crate giveaway.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.000
MARISHA: Oh, and giveaway!

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:16.000
MATT: For the DX boxes,
so be active in the chat.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
LIAM: And please go check out
the Joe Mad poster.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:19.000
LAURA: It's so sick.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
LIAM: Also check out
Battle Chasers Night War.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.310
It's a beautiful-looking game.
I played it today.

02:08:23.310 --> 02:08:26.000
LAURA: Also, give your friend a hug.
Love each other.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah, and a high-five.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:31.000
SAM: Bathe in blood.
We'll see you soon.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:38.120
[Critical Role resumes at 2:22:43]

02:22:43.940 --> 02:22:47.000
MATT: Welcome back, guys.
So, as we return to the game,

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:50.000
the morning comes to you all
in Vasselheim

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:53.000
as you awake
in the Slayer's Take guildhall.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:56.000
A brisk morning, but not too cold.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:59.000
The clouds are actually
a little more separate this morning.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
You get brief moments of blue;

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
it looks like the weather
is a little clearer

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
than you're used to seeing
in this vicinity.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:08.220
But the day is yours.
What do you guys wish to do?

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
LIAM: What do we need
to accomplish here in town?

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:13.500
Is there anything
we need to finish,

02:23:13.500 --> 02:23:16.560
or do we want
to pick our next destination?

02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:18.500
SAM: Do they sell 
potions and things here in town--

02:23:18.500 --> 02:23:20.960
SAM: No, they don't.
TALIESIN: No, very specifically they don't.

02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:22.540
SAM: Then let's
get the hell out of here.

02:23:22.540 --> 02:23:24.070
There's nothing for us here.

02:23:24.070 --> 02:23:26.000
TRAVIS: What about the Feywild?
SAM: Oh, yeah.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:27.500
MARISHA: We did talk
about the Feywild.

02:23:27.500 --> 02:23:29.000
TALIESIN: Let's drop off our--

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.500
LAURA: Don't tease me about the Feywild.

02:23:30.500 --> 02:23:32.000
TRAVIS: Wait, don't you have
to pick up something?

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
TALIESIN: Oh, I already picked it up.
TRAVIS: Not you, you.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
SAM: Me?
TALIESIN: Oh, you have a hat.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:37.500
SAM: I thought we waited for the hat.

02:23:37.500 --> 02:23:39.000
MATT: Yeah, he picked up the hat.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, balls, ass.
All right.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:44.000
SAM: There's the Feywild.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
There's dropping stuff off
at Whitestone.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:50.000
There's Marquet,
which something is there in Marquet?

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:51.500
LAURA: Is one of the Vestiges there?

02:23:51.500 --> 02:23:54.000
SAM: I don't know,
everyone just keeps talking about it.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
TRAVIS: Really?

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:59.000
SAM: Wait, weren't we 
going to go to--

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.000
MARISHA: One of the Vestiges
is in Marquet.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.290
LAURA: Which one?

02:24:04.290 --> 02:24:09.000
MARISHA: Hang on. Cabal's Ruin,
which is a magic-devouring cloak--

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:13.000
TRAVIS: Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Are we alone in this room?

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:17.000
MATT: You guys are right now
having breakfast in the guildhall.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:20.000
There's maybe two
other individuals in the room.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
One of them is
drunkenly asleep and snoring.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
The other appears to be
going about their business.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:25.500
TRAVIS: I'm just saying.

02:24:25.500 --> 02:24:29.000
MARISHA: (whispering)
Okay, I'll speak quietly.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:33.000
There's apparently
a magic-devouring cloak

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:39.000
who is being worn by the--

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:42.000
it's in Ank'Harel.
It's being worn by...

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
LAURA: It's a cloak
that devours magic?

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:47.000
MARISHA: A merchant warrior
with a missing eye.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
SAM: And there's one
in the bottom of the sea somewhere.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:53.170
LAURA: And there's a really beautiful 
strong bow in the Feywild.

02:24:53.170 --> 02:24:55.620
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go to the Feywild!
We at least know that place.

02:24:55.620 --> 02:25:01.000
TALIESIN: I say we drop everything--
we take a pit stop in Whitestone

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.430
and head towards the Feywild.

02:25:03.430 --> 02:25:06.050
MARISHA: So, technically,

02:25:06.050 --> 02:25:09.000
we don't even have
to head towards the Feywild.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.500
Do you guys remember

02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:16.000
how I kind of did that thing
with Grog's evil sword

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:19.000
and kind of
banished it away for forever?

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
TRAVIS: Are we bringing it back?
MARISHA: No.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:22.500
LAURA: Yeah, to the Dread Emperor's.
MARISHA: Right.

02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:25.000
LIAM: Not a good idea, Grog.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:26.500
MARISHA: No, we're not
bringing it back.

02:25:26.500 --> 02:25:30.000
I can do that with the rest of us.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
LAURA: You can banish us
to the Dread Emperor's island?

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.500
MARISHA: No, it's not like
a banishment.

02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:36.110
I can Plane Shift us
wherever we want to go,

02:25:36.110 --> 02:25:38.000
to an alternate plane.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:39.500
LAURA: To the Feywild?

02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:41.000
So we don't even
have to find an entrance?

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
MARISHA: Yeah, we just hold hands
and think about it really hard.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:44.500
TRAVIS: No way.

02:25:44.500 --> 02:25:47.000
MARISHA: Yeah.
It's druid magic. It's great.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:48.500
LIAM: And you put us

02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:51.000
in a safe spot 
somewhere in there, somehow?

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:52.500
MARISHA: I can take us

02:25:52.500 --> 02:25:57.000
to where we've been before,
to where it's familiar.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:58.500
LIAM: Have we been there before?
I don't know.

02:25:58.500 --> 02:26:00.000
MARISHA: Very briefly.
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
LAURA: Is it somewhere
that you have to have been,

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:05.000
or can it be somewhere
that we have been.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:12.000
MARISHA: It is somewhere
I am familiar with, I believe,

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:16.000
through means that I am familiar...

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
LAURA: Syngorn is in the Feywild.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:19.500
SAM: Normally?

02:26:19.500 --> 02:26:21.610
LIAM: No, not normally.

02:26:21.610 --> 02:26:23.500
LAURA: They transferred 
the entire city there.

02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:25.000
LIAM: I know, but you're saying
we've been there,

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:26.500
but they just did that recently.

02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:28.000
SAM: Grog's been to the Feywild.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:29.500
MATT: You can specify a target

02:26:29.500 --> 02:26:31.000
MARISHA: In general terms.
MATT: In general terms.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:34.200
MARISHA: Such as "City of Brass
on the Elemental Plane of Fire."

02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:35.710
SAM: Oh, is that
where we're going?

02:26:35.710 --> 02:26:36.860
MARISHA: No.

02:26:36.860 --> 02:26:40.480
SAM: Oh. Sounds like fun.
TALIESIN: It does, actually.

02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:43.000
MARISHA: If you guys want to go
to the Plane of Fire,

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
that's like,
a hike and a jump through a hole.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:46.500
TALIESIN: Ah.

02:26:46.500 --> 02:26:49.000
TRAVIS: No, no, not the Plane of Fire.
Just the Feywild.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:53.240
MARISHA: All right.
Yeah, I can get us there.

02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:54.400
SAM: To the Feywild.

02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:57.000
How big is the Feywild?
Is it like a football field?

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
MARISHA: It's very big.
LAURA: It's a whole other plane.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:00.500
SAM: Well, how do--

02:27:00.500 --> 02:27:02.180
do we know where we're going
in the Feywild?

02:27:02.180 --> 02:27:04.500
MARISHA: I imagine we'll figure it out
once we get there.

02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:06.660
TALIESIN: Do I know anything
about the Feywild?

02:27:06.660 --> 02:27:09.300
MATT: You have
no knowledge of the Feywild.

02:27:09.300 --> 02:27:11.650
ASHLEY: Would I know anything else?
MARISHA: What about me?

02:27:11.650 --> 02:27:13.780
LAURA: Would we have learned 
something about it in Syngorn?

02:27:13.780 --> 02:27:16.500
MATT: You have
a general idea of it, somewhat--

02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:18.000
MARISHA: Team Half-Elf, yeah.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:19.500
MATT: Somewhat,
just through your learning.

02:27:19.500 --> 02:27:21.000
You never actually visited there.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:24.000
The Feywild is a near plane,

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:28.210
a plane that overlaps
this Prime Material Plane.

02:27:28.210 --> 02:27:32.000
It's a version
of the world you live in right now

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
that is shifted and changed

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:41.000
in a place where time,
distance is relative and shifts.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Nature grows rampant and in cases

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:50.000
is hard to really expect its direction.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Things and entities exist there

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:58.000
that prefer to trick and lose wanderers.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:02.000
It's a very strange place
where some believe

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:06.000
elves initially come from
or craft from there, at least.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:07.500
LIAM: Do the two of us know enough

02:28:07.500 --> 02:28:10.620
that were you to jump
from the same place here,

02:28:10.620 --> 02:28:14.000
would you necessarily end up
in the same spot in the Feywild?

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:15.500
MATT: You have no idea.

02:28:15.500 --> 02:28:17.000
LIAM: We don't know. All right.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:18.500
MATT: You don't know anything
about the transition to the Feywild.

02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:21.000
You just know that certain doors open
at certain times,

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:24.000
especially with full moons
in certain locations,

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
the classic toadstool rings,

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:30.630
areas where the moonlight
in the realms

02:28:30.630 --> 02:28:33.680
can be a little thinner
and the barrier doors do open,

02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:37.700
and those are where creatures
can transition out or through.

02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:43.000
You do know it's a place of fey magic,

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:48.000
it's tricky, it's difficult to follow.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
SAM: Terrible.
LAURA: It sounds awful.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:55.650
MATT: Very, like, Oberon and Titania.
Weird. Interesting.

02:28:55.650 --> 02:29:00.000
MARISHA: Question.
MATT: Yes?

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:04.000
MARISHA: Hmm, okay.
SAM: Good question.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:08.000
MARISHA: It says
the Wrath of the Fey Warden

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:11.000
is what we're looking for, the bow,
and that it now acts

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:17.000
as the heart of a cancerous tree,
corrupting the verdant land.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Is there something I can do,
maybe try and...

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:26.000
TRAVIS: Hold on, is our stream up?
Are we offline right now?

02:29:27.660 --> 02:29:29.960
LUCAS: (muffled, from offscreen)
I'm checking. Just wait.

02:29:30.780 --> 02:29:33.000
ASHLEY: Hold, please.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.940
LUCAS: It says we're still online.
Hang on.

02:29:35.940 --> 02:29:39.000
LIAM: Loot Crate. Check out Loot Crate.
SAM: No one can see it.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
LAURA: No, it says it's offline.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:42.500
LIAM: Refresh it.
MARISHA: It says offline?

02:29:42.500 --> 02:29:44.170
LIAM: Quit the program
and go back in.

02:29:44.170 --> 02:29:46.000
TRAVIS: The chat is saying it's off.

02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:50.000
LUCAS: No, we're still online.
LAURA: Okay.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:51.810
LIAM: Tell them to quit and re-login.
SAM: It's back. It's back.

02:29:51.810 --> 02:29:53.400
LUCAS: I'm not sure what happened.

02:29:53.400 --> 02:29:55.140
I'm not sure it even 
dropped frames on my end.

02:29:55.140 --> 02:29:56.920
LIAM: Whoa, we were
in the Feywild for a second there.

02:29:56.920 --> 02:29:59.000
ASHLEY: Oh, it was crazy.
MATT: You guys missed six episodes.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
(exaggerated sounds of relief)

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
MATT: Everything turned out okay.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:06.360
LAURA: Yay! And we got the warden thing.
LIAM: Dragons are dead.

02:30:06.360 --> 02:30:09.000
MARISHA: Guys, I'm so glad
we won DND. We beat it.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.230
LAURA: Yeah, that was the best.

02:30:12.200 --> 02:30:14.200
TALIESIN: Roll the credits scroll.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:20.570
MARISHA: Can I maybe sense a sick tree?

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.030
You know what?
Let's go to Whitestone.

02:30:25.030 --> 02:30:27.110
Let's go to Whitestone
and drop some stuff off.

02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:29.000
LAURA: You know,
because the more I think about it,

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:32.000
I mean, we almost just
died many times

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:33.500
and the last time we tried
to get a Vestige

02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:35.000
it almost killed us,
and maybe we just need

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
a little bit
more preparation, maybe?

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:42.000
TALIESIN: Let's empty our bags,
let's prepare ourselves.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.540
There are certainly stories
in the woods of Whitestone

02:30:44.540 --> 02:30:45.970
of strange happenings,

02:30:45.970 --> 02:30:48.750
so I'm sure
there's probably some connection

02:30:48.750 --> 02:30:51.000
to the Feywild,
and we'll see what happens.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:52.500
LAURA: Make sure Whitestone 
is actually

02:30:52.500 --> 02:30:55.000
preparing something underground
just like Westruun.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
TALIESIN: Well, we have something.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
MARISHA: Yes, they have
something underground already.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:03.000
LAURA: Exactly, but there's
a spinning orb of death there.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:04.500
TALIESIN: Which, to be fair,

02:31:04.500 --> 02:31:06.000
is probably going
to keep a dragon away.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
LIAM: But I also think

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
we've earned more
than a single day of rest.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
LIAM: Let's go to Whitestone.
TALIESIN: Let's go to Whitestone.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
MARISHA: All right.
ASHLEY: Where's the sea?

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
SAM: The Ozmit Sea?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:22.000
MATT: The Ozmit Sea is
to the east of you, east-southeast,

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:25.000
and that is a wide gulf that separates--

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
from your perspective, looking at me,

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:33.000
there's Othanzia, Ozmit Sea,
and there's Tal'Dorei right here.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
LAURA: Oh, okay.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:36.220
LIAM: (sneezes)

02:31:36.220 --> 02:31:37.770
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: Bless you.
LAURA: Bless you.

02:31:37.770 --> 02:31:43.000
MARISHA: The Water Ashari
live in the Ozmit Sea.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
LAURA: Are they like mermaids?

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
MARISHA: No, I think they've got an island.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
ASHLEY: It's also the sea that I sailed.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:50.200
MARISHA: Really?
LAURA: (gasps)

02:31:50.200 --> 02:31:51.460
SAM: Ohhh.
TALIESIN: Really?

02:31:51.460 --> 02:31:53.500
LAURA: In your roving pirate days.

02:31:53.500 --> 02:31:55.160
ASHLEY: I know it well.

02:31:55.160 --> 02:31:57.500
MARISHA: How familiar are you 
with the sea?

02:31:57.500 --> 02:32:00.000
ASHLEY: I'm pretty familiar with it.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:01.680
TRAVIS: What if we go there?

02:32:01.680 --> 02:32:03.120
SAM: We could.

02:32:03.120 --> 02:32:05.000
LAURA: Wait, could I see 
the list of Vestiges?

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:08.000
SAM: The one in the bottom of the sea
is called Whisper, right?

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:09.610
LAURA: Whisper?

02:32:09.610 --> 02:32:15.000
MARISHA: A blade forged from metal
pulled from the Far Realm,

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
it was the center of many dark rituals.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
SAM: It now lies
at the bottom of the Ozmit Sea,

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:22.000
sunken with the lost ship,
The Shrew.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
LAURA: (sing-song) The Shrew?
ASHLEY: (deep voice) The Shrew.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:27.000
SAM: A storm three hundred years ago
near an island of glass.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
Anyone know about the island of glass?

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:30.500
LAURA: Have you heard
about an island of glass?

02:32:30.500 --> 02:32:32.300
MARISHA: Have I heard
about an island of glass?

02:32:32.300 --> 02:32:33.990
Have Pike or I heard
of an island of glass?

02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:36.320
MATT: I'll have both of you guys
make history checks.

02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:37.430
MARISHA: All right.

02:32:39.660 --> 02:32:41.390
I rolled a natural 1.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:46.000
MATT: You barely know
what glass is right now.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
MARISHA: Guys, water isn't glass,
that's stupid.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
TALIESIN: I would have
a theory as to what it was.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:51.500
TRAVIS: She rolled a 20.

02:32:51.500 --> 02:32:54.520
MARISHA: You rolled a 20? Oh, go Pike!
ASHLEY: Not a natural 20. Total.

02:32:54.520 --> 02:32:56.000
MATT: Explain.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:02.000
TALIESIN: Should I roll to figure out
that this is probably an active volcano?

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:05.700
TALIESIN: I'm down.

02:33:05.700 --> 02:33:07.390
LIAM: Come on, man.

02:33:07.390 --> 02:33:09.500
TALIESIN: No! Wow.

02:33:09.500 --> 02:33:11.420
SAM: Onesies.
MARISHA: Team ones. Whoo.

02:33:11.420 --> 02:33:13.190
MATT: Natural 1?
TALIESIN: Natural 1.

02:33:13.190 --> 02:33:14.470
LIAM: Snitch.

02:33:14.470 --> 02:33:15.950
MATT: Doesn't quite come to you,
but what it could be.

02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:18.000
The idea of a volcano
possibly comes to mind, but--

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:19.500
TALIESIN: I'm distracted.

02:33:19.500 --> 02:33:21.000
MATT: Yeah.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:24.000
You have not been there,
you haven't seen it,

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
but some of your crewmates
while you were traveling

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:32.000
aboard your ship
for that five, six-month period,

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:35.000
a couple of them did mention something
about on the sea,

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:39.000
a mirage-like island
that glistens in the distance,

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.730
but they said to avoid it,
said it was dangerous.

02:33:41.730 --> 02:33:44.060
SAM: Did they say where it was?

02:33:44.060 --> 02:33:45.500
MATT: No.
SAM: Damn it.

02:33:45.500 --> 02:33:47.500
ASHLEY: Heard many tales of The Shrew.

02:33:47.500 --> 02:33:48.950
LAURA: Yeah?
ASHLEY: Yeah, the ship lost at sea.

02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:52.000
MATT: You know of The Shrew,
you definitely know of The Shrew.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:53.500
ASHLEY: All sailors know of The Shrew.

02:33:53.500 --> 02:33:57.000
MARISHA: What's the story of The Shrew?
SAM: Come on, sailor.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:01.000
ASHLEY: There was a storm
three hundred years ago.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:04.000
LAURA: Near an island of glass?
ASHLEY: Near an island of glass.

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:05.500
MARISHA: It was really bad.

02:34:05.500 --> 02:34:07.000
ASHLEY: And The Shrew
just didn't sail on.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
SAM: It was tamed.
ASHLEY: It was tamed.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
LAURA: (laughs) I was waiting for it to--

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.500
MATT: Come around again?
Yeah, it was good.

02:34:12.500 --> 02:34:14.000
LAURA: Come around, yep.
TALIESIN: Taming of the Shrew fits, yeah.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.500
ASHLEY: Good tale,
but we'll get there one day.

02:34:16.500 --> 02:34:18.000
MATT: What's the plan?

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:19.500
LIAM: Whitestone.
SAM: Yes, Whitestone.

02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:21.860
TRAVIS: Can I make 
one other suggestion?

02:34:21.860 --> 02:34:23.360
Emon...

02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:25.360
go take Thordak right now.

02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:28.010
SAM: Good call...
TRAVIS: Yeah, one taker?

02:34:28.010 --> 02:34:30.420
MARISHA: You know what, Grog?
LAURA: It's a good plan, Grog.

02:34:30.420 --> 02:34:31.830
LIAM: It's cheeky.

02:34:31.830 --> 02:34:34.000
MARISHA: We will put that
in our back pocket

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:35.870
and we will think about it.

02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:38.010
LIAM: That helmet
is really something else.

02:34:38.010 --> 02:34:40.500
LAURA: You could really do 
something terrible to him with that thing.

02:34:40.500 --> 02:34:43.000
TRAVIS: I'm just saying,
I think we have an edge now.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
LAURA: I think you're probably right.
SAM: (chuckle) Attaboy.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:48.500
LIAM: That's technically true, yes.
TALIESIN: You do... have a point.

02:34:48.500 --> 02:34:50.700
LAURA: But let's make sure 
that Whitestone is safe

02:34:50.700 --> 02:34:52.020
before we do such a thing.

02:34:52.020 --> 02:34:54.570
SAM: Percy, we are in a place
that has an airship dock.

02:34:54.570 --> 02:34:56.000
TALIESIN: That is true.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:57.500
SAM: We could go steal an airship.

02:34:57.500 --> 02:34:59.000
TALIESIN: We could go steal an airship!

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
LAURA: We don't need an airship.
MARISHA: We don't need an airship.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:02.500
LAURA: We have an instant ability
to transport anywhere.

02:35:02.500 --> 02:35:04.460
SAM: It would be so cool, though.

02:35:04.460 --> 02:35:06.340
TALIESIN: Then we wouldn't
have to go to Whitestone.

02:35:06.340 --> 02:35:08.000
It would hold all of our things.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:09.500
LAURA AND MARISHA: 
When we kill all the dragons...

02:35:09.500 --> 02:35:11.000
TALIESIN: We could hold 
all of our things on the airship,

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:12.660
and I could have cannonades...

02:35:12.660 --> 02:35:15.000
LAURA: That will be the first thing we do
when Thordak dies

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:16.500
is we jump on an airship.

02:35:16.500 --> 02:35:17.500
ASHLEY: Party on the airship.

02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:19.320
MARISHA: We'll buy it
with all of the gold

02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:20.720
that we've stolen
from all the dragons.

02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:21.930
It'll be great.

02:35:21.930 --> 02:35:24.500
TALIESIN: We won't need the airship
if the dragons are dead.

02:35:24.500 --> 02:35:26.790
LAURA: All the fun has gone out of it.
TRAVIS: What are we doing?

02:35:26.790 --> 02:35:28.510
LAURA: We're going to Whitestone.
MARISHA: We're going to Whitestone.

02:35:28.510 --> 02:35:29.720
MARISHA: (piercing spell noise)

02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:32.000
SAM: Before we leave, do you want 
to sell these stupid white dragon scales?

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:32.920
TALIESIN: No.
SAM: All right, let's go.

02:35:32.920 --> 02:35:34.010
LIAM: Let's go to Whitestone.

02:35:34.010 --> 02:35:35.650
MARISHA: (repeats piercing spell noise) 
Through a tree!

02:35:35.650 --> 02:35:38.000
MATT: All right, as you guys walk 
outside of the Slayer's Take guildhall,

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.470
you find the nearest tree,
which you've used before to traverse.

02:35:40.470 --> 02:35:43.290
As you all step through the portal,
Percy and Scanlan

02:35:43.290 --> 02:35:46.000
look over their shoulder
at the distant skyport

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:50.000
and see the one airship docked there
and think, "One day..."

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.280
LIAM: So handsome.

02:35:52.280 --> 02:35:56.000
SAM: Someday, it will be ours.
TALIESIN: You'll make a fine sailor.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:59.000
SAM: Passenger.
LIAM: Swabby.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:03.540
MATT: You jump through
and emerge out the other side.

02:36:03.540 --> 02:36:07.000
As you step out of the portal,
you find yourself

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:10.000
jumping out of the center
of the Sun Tree.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
MARISHA: Can I do something?
SAM: Nope.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
MATT: What do you want to do?

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:18.950
MARISHA: While I'm in the tree,
can I do something?

02:36:18.950 --> 02:36:20.960
TRAVIS: Like kill us all?

02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:24.000
No no no. Say they go first.
"Go, go, go, go."

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
And I kind of start teleporting
through the tree

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:31.000
and while I'm in the Sun Tree
I just want to be like,

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:34.000
"Hey, boo."

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
LAURA: (laughs)

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
MARISHA: "I missed you.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:42.000
"Have you heard of this whole
cancerous tree situation

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:43.630
"in the Feywild?"

02:36:43.630 --> 02:36:45.500
SAM: (whispering) You're talking to a tree?

02:36:45.500 --> 02:36:47.000
MARISHA: Shh, no.
I'm in the middle of the tree.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:48.500
I'm in the tree.

02:36:48.500 --> 02:36:50.390
LAURA: You're stuck in the tree?

02:36:50.390 --> 02:36:53.000
MATT: As you finish this thought,
you hear this sound emerge

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:56.570
(vacuum sealing sound)
and realize it's the sound

02:36:56.570 --> 02:36:58.500
of the whole portal you've made
closing behind you

02:36:58.500 --> 02:37:00.000
because it only lasts for six seconds

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:01.500
and you should probably
get the hell out of the tree.

02:37:01.500 --> 02:37:03.000
MARISHA: Aww. I step out of the tree.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:04.190
ASHLEY: Good try.

02:37:04.190 --> 02:37:06.000
MATT: As you step out, a voice goes,

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:07.500
"Hey, boo, sorry.(kiss noise)"

02:37:07.500 --> 02:37:09.000
(laughter)

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:12.000
MATT: And it closes behind you.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.720
MARISHA: I'll talk to him later.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
MATT: You guys emerge.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:23.000
Due to the time differences,
you land here in Whitestone,

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:29.000
looking at where the sun is in the sky,
it's early afternoon,

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:33.000
as opposed to the morning
where you guys just stepped away from.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:36.000
There are people in the streets,
and you see a few,

02:37:37.570 --> 02:37:40.000
a little bit of life
has returned to this town square,

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
though still, by comparison--

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:45.000
there are folks now
that are bringing in actual,

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:49.000
healthy, looks to be fruits
from nearby trees.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:50.500
There's a little bit of trade going on.

02:37:50.500 --> 02:37:52.000
This is the first real chance you've had

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:56.000
to see a little bit of Whitestone
coming to life again.

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:59.000
As you emerge from the tree,
a few individuals nearby

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:04.000
stop and look and smile and wave,
recognizing you as you approach.

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
LAURA: Are there any leaves
on the Sun Tree yet?

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:10.530
MATT: Actually, no, there are not.
There are no leaves on the Sun Tree.

02:38:10.530 --> 02:38:12.470
SAM: (quietly) Because it's winter.

02:38:12.470 --> 02:38:14.060
LAURA: Whatever.

02:38:14.060 --> 02:38:16.000
TRAVIS: We should check
with the border patrol.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.500
SAM: There's a border patrol?

02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:20.000
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: A wolf.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:21.500
SAM: Oh, the wolf.

02:38:21.500 --> 02:38:24.000
TRAVIS: (whistles) I whistle
as loud as I can.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:27.040
MATT: Okay.
SAM: What's his name?

02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:30.000
MARISHA: I don't know.
Let me find it.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.130
SAM: Oh, boy. Harold?

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
LAURA: I just want to go find Zahra

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
and give her a hug and say hello
and see how she's doing

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:41.000
while he's talking.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:45.000
MATT: You whistle as loud as you can
for a little bit. Nothing.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:49.000
TRAVIS: Must be off doing something
(belches) important.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.340
TALIESIN: Quite.

02:38:50.340 --> 02:38:53.000
MATT: You head off and, asking around,

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:57.000
you find Zahra is actually
up in Castle Whitestone right now,

02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:00.000
just poring through
one of the studies of books,

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:01.500
and is just currently
reading and reading on her own.

02:39:01.500 --> 02:39:03.000
As you eventually ask around
and find your way there,

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
entering the room, you see her

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
with a small set of spectacles
at the end of her nose.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
She takes them off and,

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
"My darling Vex'ahlia!"

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:12.500
And comes up
and just gives you a big hug

02:39:12.500 --> 02:39:14.450
and picks you up and sets you down.

02:39:14.450 --> 02:39:16.640
"I'm so glad to see 
you're all right."

02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:19.140
LAURA: Dear, the dragon arrow 
you gave me? Killed him.

02:39:19.140 --> 02:39:21.500
Well, I didn't kill him,
actually, with it,

02:39:21.500 --> 02:39:23.000
but I did a lot of damage.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:26.000
MATT: "You killed a dragon?"
LAURA: Umbrasyl. Dead. One down.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:30.000
MATT: "I knew you would."

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:31.500
LAURA: Where's Cashew?

02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:34.000
MATT: "I don't know.
He's testy these days.

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:35.500
"I'm sure he's around."

02:39:35.500 --> 02:39:38.000
LAURA: I know his name 
is fucking Kashaw.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:41.000
So he's not there.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
MATT: "Probably down
in the city somewhere.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:47.000
"He's helping where he can.
You know broody types."

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
LAURA: I do know broody types.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:50.500
MATT: Yes, you do.

02:39:50.500 --> 02:39:52.000
LAURA: What are you reading?

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
MATT: "Oh, I'm just learning
about the history of Whitestone

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
"and I'm very intrigued
as to the actual properties

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:59.000
"of this stone 
the entire town is built on.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:03.000
"There's a lot of really,
really interesting things

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:06.000
"that can be done with the materials
in these mountains."

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
LAURA: I'm sure you have ideas.
MATT: "I do."

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
LAURA: I sit down next to her and ask,
just catching up,

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:14.000
and see if they've spotted any dragons.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
MATT: You guys continue your conversation,
catching up,

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
letting her know how things happened,
and vice versa.

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
You don't get any info
that any dragons have come by.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:25.000
Apparently, there have been
a few other arcane practitioners

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:30.000
that have been helping set up
some sort of barrier to help,

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:34.000
essentially,
dissuade attention towards the city.

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:37.000
The idea of keeping this place
as far off the map as possible,

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:40.000
should any prying eyes
find their way there.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:43.000
It's in the process
of being set up right now.

02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:50.000
LAURA: Zahra, how long did it take you
to make that arrow?

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:55.000
MATT: "A few weeks."

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:58.000
LAURA: If I were to give you
some more money,

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
do you think you could do it again?

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:09.000
MATT: "Probably, based on what--
(sighs) if I'm able to use

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:13.000
"some of the resources
here within the castle, maybe."

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:16.000
LAURA: I'll talk to Percy,
but I'm sure, if it's for a good cause...

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
MATT: "All right, perhaps I can."

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:19.500
LAURA: All right. 
I'll come find you, dear.

02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:21.000
MATT: "Wondrous."

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
What else are you guys 
trying to achieve here?

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.500
LIAM: I am trying to find Shaun Gilmore.

02:41:28.500 --> 02:41:30.490
LAURA: That's his first name?
SAM: Shaun Gilmore?

02:41:30.490 --> 02:41:31.920
MATT AND MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah, Shaun.

02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:34.240
LAURA: Shaun? 
How did you know that?

02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:35.500
MARISHA: He told us.

02:41:35.500 --> 02:41:37.000
MATT: He told you guys that
a long time ago.

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.500
LAURA: I fucking know, I remember.
MATT: (laughs)

02:41:39.500 --> 02:41:41.000
TALIESIN: Tattooed
at the small of his back.

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.060
MARISHA: Yeah, he's got a tramp stamp.
ASHLEY: Tramp stamp.

02:41:43.060 --> 02:41:47.400
SAM: Can I accompany Vax on this trip?
LIAM: Sure, come on.

02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:50.000
SAM: I want to see Gilmore.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
LIAM: Let's start
asking around town for him.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:55.000
MATT: You start asking around.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:42:01.000
You come across
a few folks you recognize,

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:05.000
you find a few of the guards
who helped you

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:08.000
with the initial reconstruction
of this city and such

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
and asking around.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
One of the nearby guards
takes his helmet off and is like,

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:13.500
"First off, I am so excited

02:42:13.500 --> 02:42:16.000
"that you guys are back.
I'm so glad you're all safe.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:19.000
"I heard that you were
off to do some dangerous things."

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
LIAM: You heard right.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:25.000
MATT: "Well, great,
I'm glad that you've survived.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
"Looking for Mr. Gilmore,

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:32.000
"he's actually down with the Realmseer.

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:35.000
"They're inspecting
the ziggurat underneath the city,

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:38.540
"so you could head down there
if you wanted to find him."

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
LIAM: Thank you.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:45.000
I'm not terribly familiar
with Whitestone,

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:46.500
could you point us
in the right direction?

02:42:46.500 --> 02:42:48.000
MATT: "It's under the castle."

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:49.500
LIAM: The castle.
MATT: "Yes."

02:42:49.500 --> 02:42:51.000
LIAM: Can't miss that.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:52.940
SAM: Yeah, we've been there before.
Yeah, let's go.

02:42:52.940 --> 02:42:54.110
LIAM: Let's go.

02:42:54.110 --> 02:42:55.320
MATT: He puts his helmet back on.

02:42:55.320 --> 02:42:57.400
"Thank you again 
for all that you do."

02:42:57.400 --> 02:43:01.000
He clicks his heels together
and continues walking through the city.

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
LIAM: All right, yeah.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
SAM: I guess we'll head
down to the ziggurat.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:06.500
LIAM: Let's do it.

02:43:06.500 --> 02:43:08.000
MATT: Everyone else going with?

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah, let's go.
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah.

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:11.500
LAURA: We taking a trip?
TALIESIN: Sure.

02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:13.960
MARISHA: Oh, are we all
going down to the ziggurat?

02:43:13.960 --> 02:43:15.460
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Nothing else to do.

02:43:15.460 --> 02:43:16.620
MARISHA: Sure.

02:43:16.620 --> 02:43:17.690
MATT: All right. You make your way

02:43:17.690 --> 02:43:20.080
down to the basement area
of Whitestone Castle,

02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:21.930
into the family catacombs,

02:43:21.930 --> 02:43:24.880
which have been cleaned up
and you can see

02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:30.000
Cassandra has put a little bit of care
into restoring it to what it was before.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:33.560
The tunnel that was carved in
has been given a little more support,

02:43:33.560 --> 02:43:37.000
and as you're making your way
down a familiar tunnel,

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:42.000
the same tunnel where you had
the showdown with Orthax,

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.850
you hear a few voices 
from up ahead.

02:43:44.850 --> 02:43:46.020
Two familiar voices.

02:43:46.020 --> 02:43:50.510
You hear the echo of some older,
gruff, elderly gentleman

02:43:50.510 --> 02:43:54.000
and a little more rambunctious
familiar voice.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:57.000
As they turn the corner,
you see them deep in conversation.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
It's the Realmseer himself
hunched forward

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:04.000
with his white hair
and balding top, turns around,

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:07.250
"And it's a great mystery to me

02:44:07.250 --> 02:44:11.940
"that they can put a--
Oh, look! They've returned.

02:44:11.940 --> 02:44:14.000
"Vox Machina themselves."

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:19.510
Gilmore, at this point,
opens his arms, standing and healthy.

02:44:19.510 --> 02:44:21.500
"My god, I've been waiting for you."

02:44:21.500 --> 02:44:23.000
LAURA: (laughs)
ASHLEY AND MARISHA: Aww.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:26.000
MATT: "And all of you
so graciously clean!"

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:27.500
LAURA: You look so healthy, Gilmore!
ASHLEY: Very healthy.

02:44:27.500 --> 02:44:29.000
MATT: "Well, I have you
to thank for that.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
"Still a ways to go."

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:35.000
LIAM: But in two or three weeks,
it's not bad. You're looking well.

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
MATT: "Well, you all have Kima
to thank for that.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:41.000
"She's been quite attentive
to my needs."

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
MARISHA: How is Whitestone finding you?

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.480
MATT: "Curious place, this Whitestone.

02:44:47.480 --> 02:44:50.910
"Well, the company's interesting."

02:44:50.910 --> 02:44:52.000
MARISHA: Sure.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:53.500
MATT: The Realmseer laughs. He's like,

02:44:53.500 --> 02:44:57.000
"(chuckles) So I've heard."

02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:00.000
"We've spent a little bit of time

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
"looking at this strange oddity
beneath the city,

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:05.000
"and I'm not going to lie to you,
it's really confusing.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:10.000
"I've a few theories on it,
as does the Arcanist,

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:11.500
"but we're still comparing notes

02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:14.000
"and we don't want
to jump to any conclusions,

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:18.000
"as tests have been inconclusive
and rather dangerous so far.

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:22.000
"However, before anything else
goes underway, I believe there's

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:26.000
"a very important bit of business
that we must attend to."

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
SAM: Business?
What business, Gilmore?

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:32.000
MATT: And he walks straight up to Grog
and just gives you a big hug.

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
SAM: Aww.
LAURA: Oh?

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:35.500
MATT: And pats you on the shoulder
and is like,

02:45:35.500 --> 02:45:37.000
"(chuckling) You big lug."

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
TRAVIS: You... Gilmore.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
(laughter)

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
MATT: Walks over to you, Pike,
and kneels down and gives you

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
a little pinch on the cheek
and is like,

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.670
"Looking as spry
and smiley as ever, I see."

02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:49.060
ASHLEY: Hello, Shaun.

02:45:49.060 --> 02:45:51.570
(more laughter)

02:45:51.570 --> 02:45:53.340
ASHLEY: I give him a kiss
on the cheek.

02:45:53.340 --> 02:45:57.030
MATT: "Ooh."
ASHLEY: (laughs) "Ooh."

02:45:57.030 --> 02:45:59.000
MATT: He turns to you.

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:02.000
"Vex'ahlia, look at you.
I hear, if my words say correct,

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:05.000
"that you folks are
a recent dragon-slaying bunch, hmm?"

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:08.450
LAURA: That we are.
MATT: "(chuckles) Good to know."

02:46:08.450 --> 02:46:10.400
MATT: Skips over you.

02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:12.100
LAURA: Oh.
ASHLEY: Save the best for last.

02:46:12.100 --> 02:46:15.000
MATT: And goes to Scanlan
and goes to ruffle your hair, and goes,

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:18.500
"And you, you,
my little bardish friend."

02:46:18.500 --> 02:46:20.000
SAM: Little?

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:21.500
MATT: "No, you're actually
physically little."

02:46:21.500 --> 02:46:24.000
SAM: Oh, I know.
MATT: "You are a tinier person."

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:25.500
MATT: "Embrace it!
It's what makes you different."

02:46:25.500 --> 02:46:30.000
SAM: That's true, I suppose.
I suppose. Yes, absolutely.

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:33.000
We've been spreading the good word
about you and your works.

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:37.000
MATT: "So I've heard
from all sorts of interesting folk.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:40.000
"I only hope one day
to wear clothes as fine as you."

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:44.000
SAM: Oh! That's a nice compliment.

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:45.500
MATT: "Percival."
TALIESIN: Good patron.

02:46:45.500 --> 02:46:47.000
MATT: "Thank you
for taking me into your home."

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:50.000
TALIESIN: You do nothing
but brighten these halls.

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:55.350
MATT: "I'm...
happy to keep things lit. (sighs)"

02:46:55.350 --> 02:46:58.570
At which point,
he goes to look towards you.

02:46:58.570 --> 02:47:00.500
The Realmseer's sitting there
tapping his arm; he's like,

02:47:00.500 --> 02:47:05.000
"Right, get on with it,
we've got work to be done."

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:09.000
And, "Shh. You be quiet.
These people have saved my life.

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:13.000
"Keyleth. Sweet Ashari princess."

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.490
MARISHA: Hi, Gilmore.

02:47:15.490 --> 02:47:19.000
MATT: "You've grown.
I can see it in your eyes."

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
He gives you a big hug.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:24.000
MARISHA: I give him a hug back.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:25.580
MATT: "Vax."

02:47:25.580 --> 02:47:27.510
LAURA: (giggles)

02:47:27.510 --> 02:47:34.000
MATT: "Vax'ildan.
Light of my eye. Smiling boy."

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:37.000
(laughter)

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.570
MATT: And he walks up
and puts his hands across your shoulders

02:47:39.570 --> 02:47:41.000
and kind of cups your face.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
"I've missed you most of all."

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:46.000
And pulls you in for a big hug
and lifts you up off the ground.

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:47.240
LIAM: Oh, hey, you.

02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:48.710
LAURA: You're strong enough to--
be careful of your wound, Gilmore!

02:47:48.710 --> 02:47:50.230
MATT: As he sets you down, heâ€™s like,

02:47:50.230 --> 02:47:52.400
"Ooh, I shouldn't have done that.
My apologies."

02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:54.000
LIAM: I pat him on the ribs.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
MATT: "Don't touch that.
It's still very tender."

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
LIAM: It's fantastic to see you.

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:01.470
You're a sight for sore eyes, yourself.
We're very happy to see you.

02:48:01.470 --> 02:48:05.000
MATT: "My sight is sore,
so this works out well.

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:09.000
"But please, these tunnels are dank
and not becoming of us.

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
"Dinner should be happening soon

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
"and you should join us,
now that you've returned, please."

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:17.000
MARISHA: Oh, before dinner,
I think we were all just curious

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:22.000
on the state of the... ziggurat,
as we were calling it.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
LAURA: The orb.
MATT: "Let's talk over dinner."

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:25.500
MARISHA: Spinning orb of death,
is what we call it.

02:48:25.500 --> 02:48:28.000
MATT: "Let's talk over dinner."
MARISHA: All right, yeah, sure.

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
TRAVIS: Wait, you said
you were doing tests on it, right?

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
Did you throw things at it?
Did it blow up?

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:35.000
MATT: "That is part of the test.
Nothing blew up. Things did go away."

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
TRAVIS: They went away?

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:38.500
LAURA: They get sucked in, Grog.

02:48:38.500 --> 02:48:40.000
MATT: "We'll talk over dinner.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
"I hate to have this discussion
without Allura here.

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.810
"I think this would only
behoove the conversation

02:48:44.810 --> 02:48:46.000
"if we're all present."

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:47.500
TALIESIN: An excellent argument.

02:48:47.500 --> 02:48:50.000
LAURA: We have some delicious
and very expensive wine.

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:51.500
MATT: "(chuckling) Well!"

02:48:51.500 --> 02:48:53.000
ASHLEY: Expensive-ass wine.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
LAURA: Expensive-ass wine
we could bust out with dinner.

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:59.000
MATT: "Color me intrigued."

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.030
LAURA: Oh, I haven't got to wink
in a really long time, you guys.

02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:02.180
It felt so good.

02:49:02.180 --> 02:49:04.220
MARISHA: Back to your old self.
LIAM: Hard life.

02:49:04.220 --> 02:49:06.980
MATT: "It was a good wink.
Finest in the land.

02:49:06.980 --> 02:49:09.800
"Well, come to the surface, then!
This place is dreary."

02:49:09.800 --> 02:49:11.000
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
MATT: "You, too, Eskil."

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:16.000
MATT: "Aye.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:20.750
"Too many smiles
in this area. I like it. It's jovial.

02:49:20.750 --> 02:49:23.000
"Don't see that
around these places too often.

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.730
"It's good to see all of you.
Come, now, yes, let's move!"

02:49:25.730 --> 02:49:28.000
MATT: You all eventually make your way
back to the surface, to Whitestone.

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.530
MARISHA: I go to Vex and Pike and go,

02:49:30.530 --> 02:49:33.990
"Is this a good opportunity
for us to break out our formal wear?"

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.470
ASHLEY: (gasps) Yes!
LAURA: Definitely, dear.

02:49:36.470 --> 02:49:38.500
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh, jeez.

02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:41.020
TALIESIN: I genuinely have no idea
what you're talking about.

02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:43.240
MARISHA: The ladies take, 
like, 20 minutes.

02:49:43.240 --> 02:49:46.520
TRAVIS: Let's be honest, it's 2 hours.
TALIESIN: 40 minutes.

02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:50.000
TRAVIS: Fucking 20 minutes, my ass.

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.180
On what plane are you 
right now? (laughs)

02:49:52.180 --> 02:49:54.000
LAURA: (laughs)

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:55.500
MARISHA: Not the Feywild. 
But maybe soon.

02:49:55.500 --> 02:49:57.000
ASHLEY: There's magic involved.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
TALIESIN: Same plane as the break room.
5 minutes is 15. (laughs)

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:02.000
MARISHA: (laughing) Yes, yes, yeah.

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:07.000
TRAVIS: "I'll be 20 minutes."
The next day...

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
LIAM: On the way out,
as we're all walking out,

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:10.500
I walk along with Gilmore
and I give him

02:50:10.500 --> 02:50:13.000
just a gentle shoulder.
Shoulder to shoulder. And say,

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:18.000
"It's really good
to see you on your feet.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:22.000
"It's the best smile I've had in ages."

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:26.000
MATT: "You and me both."

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:27.500
LAURA: While we're getting ready,

02:50:27.500 --> 02:50:31.000
I would like to talk to Pike

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:34.000
about a certain proposal that happened.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
None of us have addressed it.

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
ASHLEY: I know, because I just--

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
LAURA: What happened?
ASHLEY: What should I do?

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
LAURA: What did you tell him?
Did you tell him yes, did you tell him no?

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:43.500
ASHLEY: I'm just so--

02:50:43.500 --> 02:50:45.000
MARISHA: Hang on,
what exactly did he say, by the way?

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
ASHLEY: I just said we'll circle back.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
LAURA: We'll circle back?
MARISHA: Circle back.

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:50.500
LAURA: (laughing) How did he take that?

02:50:50.500 --> 02:50:54.000
ASHLEY: I think he was fine with it.
He just understands that I just--

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
MARISHA: Treat proposals
like we do our dungeons?

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
(laughs) We circle back.

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
ASHLEY: Isn't that the only way
to just treat all things?

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
I guess, I don't know.
I don't know.

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:05.000
MARISHA: (giggles)
LAURA: How do you feel about him, Pike?

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:09.000
ASHLEY: I just don't know.
I just feel so confused.

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
MARISHA: I understand that.

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:14.000
ASHLEY: He wears you down a little.

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
LIAM: (cracks up)

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:19.020
ASHLEY: And there's 
something there, for him.

02:51:19.020 --> 02:51:23.000
MARISHA: I don't know if that's
a good reason to say yes, though.

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
ASHLEY: Oh, I don't know. 
He's just very charming.

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:26.500
MARISHA AND LAURA: He is very charming.

02:51:26.500 --> 02:51:29.000
LAURA: And I noticed,
he's becoming more charming.

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
ASHLEY: Yes, I know!

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:32.500
MARISHA: Yeah, what is with that?
I didn't know that was possible.

02:51:32.500 --> 02:51:34.000
ASHLEY: How? I feel like
he goes to sleep

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:35.500
and then the next morning 
he's like--

02:51:35.500 --> 02:51:37.000
ASHLEY AND LAURA: Even more charming!

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:38.000
LAURA: I don't understand it.

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:39.500
ASHLEY: Why is that?
MARISHA: I don't know.

02:51:39.500 --> 02:51:41.000
LAURA: Like, every once in a while
I look at him and I go:

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:42.500
MARISHA: Yeah, no,
and then I feel really--

02:51:42.500 --> 02:51:43.500
LAURA: No, but he's small,

02:51:43.500 --> 02:51:44.500
but at the same time,
I'm kind of interested.

02:51:44.500 --> 02:51:46.000
MARISHA: Right! And you kind of
think about it for a second

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:47.000
and you entertain it,

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:48.740
and then you feel really gross
about yourself.

02:51:48.740 --> 02:51:50.000
LAURA: You feel like-- yeah!
ASHLEY: Yes! Yes.

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:54.000
LAURA: But if you're actually interested,
then it's not gross at all.

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.660
MARISHA: No! Of course it's not gross
if you're actually interested.

02:51:56.660 --> 02:51:59.000
ASHLEY: I know. I just. (groans)

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
I've had feelings for someone
for a long time,

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
but maybe they're slowly fading.
I don't know.

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:06.000
LAURA: Wait.
MARISHA: Wait, what?

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:10.000
ASHLEY: I have. I don't know
if I feel comfortable talking about it.

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:11.500
But it's fine.

02:52:11.500 --> 02:52:13.360
LAURA: We don't want to push you, Pike,
but you know, it's just us girls here.

02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:18.000
MARISHA: I know! And we've been through
so many uncomfortable things together.

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:19.150
ASHLEY: (groans)

02:52:19.150 --> 02:52:21.000
MARISHA: Most of life
is so uncomfortable.

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Be comfortable right now.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
ASHLEY: I just. I don't know.

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:30.000
It's still something
that I need to think about.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
LAURA: All right.
MARISHA: We understand.

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:33.500
ASHLEY: I'm just.

02:52:33.500 --> 02:52:35.000
LAURA: You pray
to your Sarenrae about it.

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
ASHLEY: Okay. (laughs)

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:40.000
You do look lovely, though,
in your dress.

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
LAURA: You look beautiful.
MARISHA: You look so cute.

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
LAURA, ASHLEY, AND MARISHA: (laugh)

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:45.500
ASHLEY: Thanks.
ASHLEY: I do a twirl.

02:52:45.500 --> 02:52:47.000
(more laughter)

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:50.000
MARISHA: I do a little air cantrip
to make the skirt poof out.

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:53.000
ASHLEY: Ooh.
LAURA: I tug up my dress.

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:57.000
MARISHA: Hey, do you guys mind
tying me up a bit?

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
LAURA: Of course!
MARISHA: Nice and tight. (grunts)

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:00.500
LAURA: Can you breathe?

02:53:00.500 --> 02:53:01.890
MARISHA: (strained)
No, but that means it's right.

02:53:01.890 --> 02:53:03.280
LAURA: All right.
MARISHA: All right, I'm good.

02:53:03.280 --> 02:53:05.160
TALIESIN: I assume there's clean clothes 
for everybody in their quarters?

02:53:05.160 --> 02:53:06.500
MATT: Yeah, it's all good.

02:53:06.500 --> 02:53:08.000
TRAVIS: I'm wearing the same shit.

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
(laughter)

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:13.390
SAM: And the big hat?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:53:13.390 --> 02:53:16.500
MATT: (laughing) To dinner. (shoonk)

02:53:16.500 --> 02:53:20.000
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yeah.
I paid money for this thing.

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:23.020
TALIESIN: And I'm going to arrange
for our stuff to be stowed in the vault.

02:53:23.020 --> 02:53:26.000
MATT: Okay. Not a worry.

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:29.000
All right, so as the sun sets,

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:33.000
you find your way down
to the proper dinner table.

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:36.700
Gilmore is there, Eskil is there,
Cassandra is there...

02:53:36.700 --> 02:53:39.000
MARISHA: We look fabulous.
MATT: You guys look fantastic.

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:42.000
SAM: They do.
MARISHA: Yes. We do.

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
MATT: Fine outfits have been provided
for the men,

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
if they wish to wear them,
as well. Some do not.

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:47.500
TALIESIN: Oh, I am dressed.
LIAM: I'm dressed, yeah.

02:53:47.500 --> 02:53:49.000
SAM: Oh, I'll dress up.
I'll dress up for dinner.

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:50.500
MATT: All righty.
As you guys sit down,

02:53:50.500 --> 02:53:52.000
pleasantries are exchanged--

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:53.500
(yawns) Pardon me.

02:53:53.500 --> 02:53:55.970
You catch up a bit with Cassandra.
Partway through--

02:53:55.970 --> 02:53:57.500
LAURA: Aw, Matt.

02:53:57.500 --> 02:53:59.000
MATT: What?

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:00.500
LIAM: E3, y'all.

02:54:00.500 --> 02:54:05.000
TALIESIN: Sit down, have a beer, 
watch our game.

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
MARISHA: (laughs) 2 pm.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
MATT: Within the next 15 minutes or so,

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
before food is brought to the table,

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:14.420
Allura finally enters
in a very, very nice dress, and says,

02:54:14.420 --> 02:54:17.140
"It is so good
to see you all are safe."

02:54:17.140 --> 02:54:18.880
MARISHA: Allura!
ASHLEY: Hello.

02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:20.120
LAURA: I give her a hug.

02:54:20.120 --> 02:54:21.940
MATT: She then gives you a big,
wonderful hug.

02:54:21.940 --> 02:54:23.500
LAURA: How's Kima?
We haven't seen her yet.

02:54:23.500 --> 02:54:24.490
MATT: "Well..."

02:54:24.490 --> 02:54:26.180
She looks over this way
and Kima walks in,

02:54:26.180 --> 02:54:27.590
for the first time you've seen her

02:54:27.590 --> 02:54:30.000
really out of armor
since you first saw her.

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:33.000
Her hair is also in similar braids
to her side

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.740
and she herself is wearing
a golden dress,

02:54:35.740 --> 02:54:38.000
though she's kind of like...

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:39.500
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know the feeling.

02:54:39.500 --> 02:54:41.000
(laughter)

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
MATT: She comes in.

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
MARISHA: Kima.
MATT: "Hello."

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:46.500
ASHLEY: Oh, you look lovely.

02:54:46.500 --> 02:54:49.000
MARISHA: Keyleth goes over
and gives her a hug.

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:50.500
MATT: She gives you a hug and goes,

02:54:50.500 --> 02:54:55.000
"It's good to see you guys.
I'm glad you're all right...

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.500
"This feels weird. Does this feel weird?
This feels weird."

02:54:57.500 --> 02:55:00.000
MARISHA: It's only for a few hours.
Don't worry about it.

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:01.500
TRAVIS: What are you wearing?

02:55:01.500 --> 02:55:03.000
MATT: "That's what I'm saying!
Do I have to wear--

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
"he's not wearing anything.
Do I have to wear--"

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:06.500
LAURA: You don't have to wear a dress, Kima.

02:55:06.500 --> 02:55:09.500
MATT: "You don't have to wear it, Kima.
It was just a suggestion."

02:55:09.500 --> 02:55:11.000
LAURA: (chuckles)

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:12.500
MATT: "I'm going to go change.
I'll be right back."

02:55:12.500 --> 02:55:13.500
TRAVIS: Yeah, go change.

02:55:13.500 --> 02:55:15.900
MATT: She darts off for a bit
and Allura smiles and facepalms a bit.

02:55:15.900 --> 02:55:17.140
SAM: You two are at the kiddie table.

02:55:17.140 --> 02:55:18.950
(laughter)

02:55:18.950 --> 02:55:22.000
LIAM: You ought to let her
try that helmet on later.

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:23.500
SAM: Show some class, man.

02:55:23.500 --> 02:55:25.000
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:26.500
MATT: You guys catch up a bit
as Allura speaks

02:55:26.500 --> 02:55:32.000
about her and Drake's escape
from Westruun.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:36.000
Kima eventually comes back,
wearing ratty clothing.

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:40.000
Shirt, pants, the general wear
she'd pick up throughout the city.

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:44.000
And is still carrying
her small maul at her side.

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:45.500
It's like her little comfort blanket.
(thud) Next to the table.

02:55:45.500 --> 02:55:48.000
TRAVIS: Yeah. That's better.

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:51.000
MATT: She scoots up next to Allura.

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
Gilmore snaps his fingers

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:57.000
and wine begins to pour
from the servants. Cassandra says,

02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:00.000
"Well, thank you all for coming.

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:04.000
"I believe there is much
to get underway here. This,"a

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:09.000
MATT: And she gestures
towards Gilmore and Allura; they nod.

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:13.000
Eskil raises his hand a moment.

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:17.000
MATT: "So, while you've been gone.

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
"Allura, you've been
doing this research for a bit."

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:23.000
"Thank you, thank you.
So, we've been trying

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:30.000
"to ascertain the nature
of the ziggurat beneath the city.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:33.000
"The ziggurat itself is built over

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:37.000
"what appears to be
an ancient temple of Ioun.

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
"The glass substance,

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:43.000
"the diluted whitestone
that has been reformed into glass,

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:47.000
"is used as a very strong arcane current.

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:50.000
"A lot of energy was being placed
in this location,

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000
"as there is an actual,
what appears to be

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:57.810
"an arcane leyline, a nexus point,

02:56:57.810 --> 02:57:02.000
"near and above Whitestone,
hence the Sun Tree's placement."

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:05.000
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:08.000
MATT: "And why it flourishes
so well in this region.

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:12.000
"But everything within
a certain vicinity of this temple,

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:19.000
"of this dark spot, if you will,
is eaten.

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:25.000
"Doesn't vanish, it's not cancelled,
it's taken. Devoured.

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:30.580
"Everything placed within
that small little globule of darkness

02:57:30.580 --> 02:57:34.000
"is taken somewhere as well.

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
"Now, at first, we thought
maybe it was just destroying,

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:39.000
"but the arcane energy we feel,

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:43.000
"the flow of it,
it's drawing it somewhere.

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:47.000
"Meaning that this is not
what I had feared to be

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:50.000
"a sphere of annihilation,
an object of complete destruction.

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.490
"Instead it feels like it's a siphon.

02:57:55.000 --> 02:58:01.000
"Now, a siphon. Siphons are very old.
Siphons were used in the First War.

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:04.000
"They were used as a means

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:07.740
"of transferring extremely powerful...

02:58:11.430 --> 02:58:14.000
"raw magical powers.

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:17.000
"They were placed strategically
throughout the world's crust

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.600
"at these various nexus points

02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:23.000
"as a means of creating
extremely powerful relics.

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:26.000
"The ones that you seek, the ones
that made the Vestiges themselves,

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:31.000
"were crafted through the use
of some of these siphons,

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:32.500
"but they have been lost and,
many thought,

02:58:32.500 --> 02:58:37.000
"destroyed for a very long time,
or at least inert.

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:40.000
"I have reason to believe
that this may be one.

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:41.500
"And it may be active.

02:58:41.500 --> 02:58:44.000
"As to where the other side lies,
I do not know.

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:47.000
"Because each siphon has two points."

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:50.000
TALIESIN: So it's fair to assume
that at the other end of this

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:55.000
is something old, something trapped,
something hungry.

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:56.500
MATT: "Perhaps."

02:58:56.500 --> 02:58:59.000
LAURA: Would it be in this plane
or another?

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:00.500
MATT: "I have no idea.

02:59:00.500 --> 02:59:02.000
"Everything we've attempted
to put through it

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:05.000
"that had any sort
of magical connection,

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:08.000
"whether it be
through inter-planal scrying,

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000
"anything that would bring us
to the other side of this,

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:14.000
"is crushed, consumed,
and transferred as part of it.

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:15.500
"None of our rituals 
or enchantments

02:59:15.500 --> 02:59:19.000
"will let us see through this
spinning marble, as you call it."

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
LAURA: You haven't
put any blood through it, though?

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:22.500
TALIESIN: Let's not.

02:59:22.500 --> 02:59:24.000
LAURA: No, I'm hoping 
that hasn't happened.

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:28.000
MARISHA: So nothing survives 
the transfer.

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:33.000
It is destroyed into its...
purest components, it sounds.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:34.530
MATT: "Seemingly, yes."

02:59:34.530 --> 02:59:36.000
LIAM: Or is it? Don't know?

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:40.000
Is it that you have no idea
what happened to things put through?

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:41.500
MATT: "We're still delving into it,

02:59:41.500 --> 02:59:43.000
"and it may be a little while
before we figure this out,

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:46.000
"but this is the best I can ascertain
with my knowledge at my disposal.

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:51.690
"And the Realmseer and Gilmore
can back up this research.

02:59:51.690 --> 02:59:53.500
"We've all worked together
these past weeks

02:59:53.500 --> 02:59:57.000
"and we're all kind of
coming to the same conclusion."

02:59:57.000 --> 03:00:01.000
She gestures to Gilmore.
Gilmore says,

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:04.000
"I've only been
on this case personally

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.990
"for a few days

03:00:06.990 --> 03:00:12.000
"of rising health standards
in my body

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:16.000
"and I've thrown everything
I can at it, honestly,

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:19.000
"and it's all just come to nothing.
Gone. (pthbbt)"

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:22.000
TALIESIN: This is disappointing.

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:26.000
MATT: "You're telling me."
TRAVIS: What about a person?

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:29.000
MATT: "(laughing) I'm not
sending a person through there."

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:33.970
MARISHA: To be fair, Grog,
I might have tried that, a little.

03:00:33.970 --> 03:00:36.000
SAM: What?
TALIESIN: Yes, that's right.

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:41.000
MARISHA: I sort of stuck my hand
in the spinning ball of death

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:45.000
and let's just say

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
I'm glad I'm still here
standing with you all.

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:48.810
LAURA: Was it sucking you in?

03:00:48.810 --> 03:00:52.040
MARISHA: It did a considerable 
amount of damage to my hand

03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:56.000
and definitely felt
like it was sucking me in

03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:59.700
and I had to resist pretty hard.

03:00:59.700 --> 03:01:01.500
But it seems like anything
that goes in that sphere

03:01:01.500 --> 03:01:06.550
doesn't come out the other end intact.

03:01:06.550 --> 03:01:09.000
LAURA: Gilmore-- any of you, Allura--

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:16.000
have you experienced
any kind of draw toward the orb?

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:20.000
Do you feel different,
having been around it for very long?

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:24.000
MATT: Gilmore cocks a curious eye
to the Realmseer.

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:25.500
The Realmseer thinks
and scratches his chin,

03:01:25.500 --> 03:01:27.000
looks to Allura.

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:30.210
Allura looks down at the table
with her arms crossed,

03:01:30.210 --> 03:01:32.000
looks to Kima.

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:35.000
Kima's finishing her big drink.

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:38.020
"I stay away from it.
It creeps the hell out of me."

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:45.000
"Not to my knowledge.
Do you think we should be worried?"

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:46.500
LAURA: Well, I don't know.

03:01:46.500 --> 03:01:51.000
I mean, it is a very strong relic
that we don't know how it works.

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000
MATT: "The difficulty
in our research

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:56.000
"is most of our means of inspection
are, well,"

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:59.000
LAURA: Up close and personal.
MATT: "Of arcane nature."

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:00.500
TALIESIN: I was hoping
that perhaps we could talk

03:02:00.500 --> 03:02:04.000
about some engineering possibilities
of finding ways

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:07.000
that science can measure what it is
where magic cannot.

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000
Something safe.

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000
SAM: (scoffs) Science, Percy?

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:15.000
TALIESIN: In this sense, as it stands.

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000
MATT: "We're open
to all possible suggestions.

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:20.000
"We're kind of at the end of our rope
for the time being.

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:25.000
"We may send a few of us
across the way to, well,

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:28.000
"a few different places
for more information.

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:30.000
"May do a bit
of traveling ourselves, it seems."

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:33.000
TALIESIN: I'll sketch something
with my copious free time.

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:36.000
MATT: "Hm. Please do."

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:39.000
SAM: No dragons
have buzzed by here in our absence?

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000
MATT: They kind of
look to themselves.

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000
"None yet,
but we've been very careful.

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:47.000
"We're in the process of installing
some semblance of,

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:51.000
"(sighs) for lack of a better term,
sort of a screen.

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:56.000
"Ways to reflect
and perhaps cloud anyone

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:59.000
"who attempts to peer too far
into the northern regions of Whitestone.

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:00.500
"The last thing we need

03:03:00.500 --> 03:03:02.000
"is any of these dragons
finding their way up north

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:04.000
"where you've kept all of us
and the refugees safe,

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:08.000
"so we're trying not
to piss any of them off,

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:11.000
"while also trying to make sure
that maybe they're

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000
"not really looking
behind this curtain of cloud."

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:16.000
TALIESIN: Any fortifications
would be helpful.

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:20.570
LAURA: Don't dragons sort of
see past those things?

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:25.000
MATT: "We're doing our best
to try and meet those standards."

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:30.000
TALIESIN: I have another request
in that direction that might help.

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:33.000
If there was a way
to spread the word in this city

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:38.000
and amongst those who travel,
to not speak of us.

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:44.000
We should probably not be hailed
in this city at all.

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000
Our names should be stricken
from any record of it.

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.000
MATT: Allura leans forward 
on the table.

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000
"No, I see. You're right.

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000
"There is merit in that,
though it will be difficult.

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:53.500
"Many here look up to you.

03:03:53.500 --> 03:03:56.000
"They see you as the salvation
of this city.

03:03:56.000 --> 03:04:00.000
"But I believe we can go about
and speak with them

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:03.840
"and help instill the idea
that it's for the better good

03:04:03.840 --> 03:04:08.000
"that you are not mentioned."

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000
TALIESIN: Best to be nameless,
at this point.

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:13.000
MARISHA: It's for their own safety.
TALIESIN: It's for everybody's.

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000
LAURA: We-who-must-not-be-named.
SAM: The Unmentionables.

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000
TALIESIN: (cracks up)
You're a terrible person.

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:18.500
LAURA: (gasps) I love it.

03:04:18.500 --> 03:04:21.000
MARISHA: Yeah. My choice is
The Unmentionables. I like it.

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:24.000
MATT: Allura says,
"I did find some research

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:27.000
"on some of these Vestiges
you are seeking."

03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000
TALIESIN: Oh!
LAURA: Yes!

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000
MATT: "From what I could bring forth

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:34.940
"from the Cobalt Reserve in Westruun,

"swallowed by a terrible tree."

03:04:39.500 --> 03:04:42.000
LAURA: Yes, the Warden.

03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:45.000
MATT: "Is that the name of it?"
LAURA: The Wrath of the Fey Warden.

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:46.500
MATT: "So you've found
some information yourself?"

03:04:46.500 --> 03:04:48.000
LAURA: Just the name.

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:51.920
SAM: And that it's
in the Feywild, but nothing more.

03:04:51.920 --> 03:04:55.100
MATT: "(sighs) This tree that holds it,
it's a tree seeded by the betrayal

03:04:55.100 --> 03:04:59.000

TRAVIS: Sounds nasty.

03:05:10.280 --> 03:05:12.000
MATT: "It doesn't sound very fun, no."

03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:14.000
SAM: The Shademark Balg?

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:17.000
MATT: "The Shademirk Bog."
SAM: Ugh, it sounds awful.

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:19.000
MATT: "It seeps from this tree.

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:22.790
"It is held at bay
by the rivers of the Gilded Run."

03:05:24.730 --> 03:05:26.500
MARISHA: The rivers are called
the Gilded Run?

03:05:26.500 --> 03:05:28.000
MATT: "Mm-hm."

03:05:29.730 --> 03:05:32.000
SAM: Okay. Well, that helps us.
Those are clues.

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:34.000
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:37.320
MARISHA: And the Shademirk Bog 
pours out of the tree?

03:05:37.320 --> 03:05:39.000
LAURA: Out of the cancerous tree.

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:41.000
MARISHA: The tree is responsible
for a swampy bog.

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.370
MATT: "From best I could ascertain
from my research, yes."

03:05:43.370 --> 03:05:47.000
LAURA: And Fen-wraths?
What's the name?

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.610
SAM: Fenthras,
Wrath of the Fey Warden.

03:05:49.610 --> 03:05:54.000
LAURA: Fenthras is inside of the tree
that is terrible.

03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:56.000
MATT: "It is very possible."

03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:57.140
TALIESIN: Oh no.
SAM: Okay.

03:05:57.140 --> 03:05:59.000
LIAM: Do you know anything
about the Vestige itself?

03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:02.010
MATT: "I don't, unfortunately.
Most of the Cobalt Reserve was destroyed

03:06:02.010 --> 03:06:07.050
"and I was under siege at the moment
from the return of the dragons. (sighs)"

03:06:07.050 --> 03:06:10.000
LAURA: Did you happen to find
in your research what, perhaps,

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:13.000
we might face in the Feywild?

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:14.500
I mean, we've learned
a little bit of it,

03:06:14.500 --> 03:06:18.420
but I know
that it's going to be rather dangerous.

03:06:18.420 --> 03:06:21.680
MATT: "I've not been there myself, 
to be honest. It creeps me out."

03:06:21.680 --> 03:06:25.500
LAURA: (laughs)
TRAVIS: (laughs) No? Sorry.

03:06:25.500 --> 03:06:28.170
MATT: "I did find also
about the Spire of Conflux.

03:06:28.170 --> 03:06:31.000
"It is a staff
that can bend the elements

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:32.500
"and was taken into The Abyss

03:06:32.500 --> 03:06:36.000
"by Joran the Sea-Speaker,
hero of the Verdant Expanse,

03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:40.000
"about four centuries back,
and was never heard from again."

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:43.000
MARISHA: Joran the what?
MATT: "Joran the Sea-Speaker."

03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:45.000
SAM: He speaks to the sea?

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:46.180
MATT: "Perhaps."

03:06:46.180 --> 03:06:48.420
TALIESIN: Or just the letter C.
LAURA: (laughs)

03:06:48.420 --> 03:06:51.430
SAM: Cookie Monster.
TRAVIS: Hero.

03:06:51.430 --> 03:06:54.000
MATT: "I do have some research
about the dragons, as well."

03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:56.000
LAURA: Oh.

03:06:56.000 --> 03:07:01.000
MATT: "I've done a bit
of looking into the personality types,

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:07.000
"the habits of some of these chromatics
you may be coming up against.

03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:10.630
"The black dragon,
you seemingly already dealt with,

03:07:10.630 --> 03:07:12.770
"if word has come to me correctly."

03:07:12.770 --> 03:07:13.720
LAURA: Yes.

03:07:13.720 --> 03:07:17.000
MATT: "Which is magnificent
and well done. Very dangerous.

03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:24.000
"Let's hope they don't decide
to strike back soon."

03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:29.000
LAURA: Good thing we didn't provoke them
in the cave at all, Percival.

03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:31.000
TALIESIN: If they came there,
they would've been provoked,

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:34.000
I figured.

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:38.000
MATT: "I did find that
the white dragons, they're more primal.

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:41.000
"They're overall less intelligent
than other chromatics."

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:42.500
And some 
of this information you know.

03:07:42.500 --> 03:07:45.000
LAURA: Yeah, why am I writing this down?
I know this shit.

03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:49.000
MATT: "But what they do is they--

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:52.000
"(sighs) well, don't let
the lack of intelligence

03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:54.000
"lull you into comfort.

03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:56.000
"They are also unpredictable and raw.

03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:57.500
"Dangerous hunters,

03:07:57.500 --> 03:08:01.000
"they stalk in ruined lands
of ice and vengeance.

"Their memory is eternal.

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:06.000
"They recall every slight defeat

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:11.000
"and have been known to hold vendettas
for centuries and centuries.

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:15.000
"They despise other dragons

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:18.000
"and this loose alignment with Thordak

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:21.000
"is stranger than the others
for the white dragon.

03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:24.400
"Though Vorugal's distance to the others
is intentional, most likely.

03:08:27.120 --> 03:08:31.000
"I mean, the entire alignment
between them is strange, anyway,

03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:33.000
"but particularly
with the white dragon.

03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:37.000
"They generally steer very clear of,
or are bent on destroying,

03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:41.000
"any other types of dragons
that may wander in their midst."

03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:42.930
LAURA: (whispering) Interesting.

03:08:42.930 --> 03:08:47.000
MATT: "Green dragons, in particular,
are manipulative.

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:52.000
"Liars, by nature, finding pleasure
in power over others.

03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:54.000
"Through deceit and promises
of wealth and glory, they corrupt.

03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:59.000
"They play subservience
to other dragons,

03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:02.000
"then plot their demise
to claim their hoards.

03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:08.280
"They're the seedy underbelly
of the chromatic world, if you will.

03:09:08.280 --> 03:09:13.000
"They amass powerful allies,
human and beyond, to their will,

03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:17.000
"bending them and using them as tools.

"Their life and their very presence

03:09:18.500 --> 03:09:21.000
"is poison to those around them,

03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:26.000
"and is the very basis 
of their danger.

03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:30.000
"They corrupt the air around them

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:34.000
"I found a bit about
this Raishan you mentioned,

"and word has spoken,
though little that exists out there,

"that she is also
a very practitioned

"weaver of the arcane arts,
so be warned."

03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:50.000
MARISHA: So much so

03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:57.000
that she could almost pass
as a druid wielding natural magic?

03:09:57.000 --> 03:10:00.000
MATT: "I can imagine
that's quite within her grasp.

03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:04.000
"I've heard rumors of her
calling the sky down upon her enemies.

03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:06.460
"Previous individuals
that hoped to raid her space

03:10:06.460 --> 03:10:10.000
"were swallowed in quaking earth
as she laughed from above."

03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:13.500
SAM: Druid-y things.

03:10:13.500 --> 03:10:17.000
MARISHA: I want to kill her so hard.
(strained) I want her to die.

03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:18.500
TALIESIN: Do we know where these--

03:10:18.500 --> 03:10:21.000
where these dragons have been
all this time,

03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:24.000
where they were banished to?

03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:25.500
MATT: "I mean, most of these dragons

03:10:25.500 --> 03:10:27.000
"lived their lives
wherever they once were before.

03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:32.000
"Raishan used to exist
in the mountains outside of Syngorn

03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:33.500
"and actually had amassed

03:10:33.500 --> 03:10:39.000
"a sizeable horde of followers,
lizard-men. Lizardfolk, all sorts."

03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:43.000
TALIESIN: Wait, then Thordak
was banished to the Fire Plane?

03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:48.000
MATT: "Thordak we had banished, yes.
Thordak, in particular.

03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:54.000
"Now, red dragons are true tyrants,
built on impulse and rage.

03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:55.500
"Arrogant to the core,

03:10:55.500 --> 03:11:01.000
"they see themselves
as rightful rulers over all.

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:05.000
"And Thordak, the king
of all other dragons, as well.

03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:07.000
"He is powerful enough
to amass networks

03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:09.000
"of spies and followers far beyond

03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:15.000
"just the dragons that we've battled,
I'm sure.

03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:16.500
"So the more time that passes,

03:11:16.500 --> 03:11:19.000
"the more powerful
that network will become."

03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:20.500
LAURA: (muffled) Oh, fuck.

03:11:20.500 --> 03:11:22.000
TALIESIN: I've had a terrible thought,

03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:25.520
and it is sort of my business
to have terrible thoughts.

03:11:25.520 --> 03:11:29.000
What else has been banished
to the Fire Plane?

03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:31.000
TRAVIS: The djinn?

03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:32.500
TALIESIN: Well, I say this

03:11:32.500 --> 03:11:36.000
because if I were to slowly
open the portal to the Fire Plane

03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:39.000
and power it and make it bigger
and bigger and bigger,

03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:42.000
eventually it would be
a hole into that dimension

03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:44.000
that's big enough
for a dragon to fit through,

03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:47.000
but still not big enough for me,

03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:49.830
so I need to keep eating,
to make it bigger.

03:11:49.830 --> 03:11:52.220
LAURA: (gasps)

03:11:52.220 --> 03:11:56.000
TALIESIN: And maybe they might
be looking for what's down there

03:11:56.000 --> 03:12:00.000
so they can feed it
and make a bigger hole.

03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:03.000
Just a thought. It may be nothing.

03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:07.020
LAURA: You think there's something
bigger than Thordak in the Fire Plane?

03:12:07.020 --> 03:12:11.000
TALIESIN: I have terrible thoughts.
It's a terrible thought.

03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:13.000
MARISHA: I mean, I'm sure there is
something bigger than Thordak,

03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:16.000
probably in the Fire Plane,

03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:20.000
but the Fire Ashari closed the portal.

03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:22.000
TALIESIN: That may
not have been the portal.

03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:25.000
MARISHA: That was the portal

03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:30.000
that Thordak came out of.
It ripped apart my entire--

03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:32.230
TALIESIN: That may just be
where he escaped.

03:12:32.230 --> 03:12:35.000
That power may still be flowing.

03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:40.440
MARISHA: Well, Allura, how did you
lock him in the Fire Plane to begin with?

03:12:40.440 --> 03:12:47.110
MATT: "Well, we had,
through clever subterfuge,

03:12:47.110 --> 03:12:51.020
"managed to have a member of our team

03:12:51.020 --> 03:12:56.000
"work as a follower of Thordak,

03:12:56.000 --> 03:13:00.000
"work into his greater trust

03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:04.000
"and convince him
that to perpetuate his wealth,

03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:07.000
"his growth, his strength,

03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:12.000
"that he needed to truly embrace
the essence of fire.

03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:16.000
"And there are crystals,

03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:20.650
"there are remnants of the First War

03:13:20.650 --> 03:13:22.990
"that exist in this world and others.

03:13:22.990 --> 03:13:26.000
"The very core
of the elemental chaos itself,

"the hearts of the titans left behind.

03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:33.450
"These heart-stones are
the very basis,

03:13:33.450 --> 03:13:36.360
"or, at least,
shadows of the basis

03:13:36.360 --> 03:13:41.000
"of what made the elements
when creation came to be.

03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:45.000
"We had found one of these
on the Fire Plane,

03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:48.000
"but the nature of these
is that they cannot be removed.

03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:51.000
"If they are brought
beyond the plane themselves,

03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:54.000
"they generally shatter,

03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:58.000
"and the few that can
be brought across temporarily,

03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:00.000
"the magics that contain them
do weaken,

03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:02.000
"and those that attempted
to harness their power

"leave it to ruin,
destroying all around them

03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:06.500
"before it whirls itself
into a frenzy

03:14:06.500 --> 03:14:12.000
"of uncontrollable arcane mass
and destroys everything nearby.

03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:13.500
"These were many of the fools

03:14:13.500 --> 03:14:17.000
"who ushered in the beginning
of the Second War.

03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:22.000
"So. Essentially,
we convinced Thordak

03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:24.000
"to find one of these in the plane

03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:26.850
"and convinced him
that he had the power to contain it.

03:14:26.850 --> 03:14:29.000
"Once there,
all of our forces gathered

03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:33.000
"and we attacked him,
pressed him down,

03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:35.000
"and the gem
that we had convinced him--

03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:36.460
"the heart-stone
that we had convinced him

03:14:36.460 --> 03:14:39.000
"to take into himself,

03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:42.000
"well, we found a way to seal it,

03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:45.040
"to banish it permanently to that plane
so that he could not escape."

03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:53.000
MARISHA: All right. So, that's all good.

03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:56.000
But he did escape.

03:14:56.000 --> 03:14:59.000
LAURA: Could he still
potentially have it inside of him?

03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:02.000
MARISHA: Exactly!
That was my question!

03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:06.260
SAM: Well, she asked it,
so, technically, it's hers.

03:15:06.260 --> 03:15:10.630
MATT: She turns and you can see Gilmore's
sitting at the table like this.

03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:16.000
"I got a very good close
at that dragon.

03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:20.960
"A very good close look,
to finish my sentence.

03:15:20.960 --> 03:15:23.000
"I've been drinking
plenty of wine tonight; don't judge me."

03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:24.500
ASHLEY: Expensive-ass wine.

03:15:24.500 --> 03:15:26.000
TALIESIN: It's the best wine.

03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:27.500
MATT: "It is very expensive,
fine wine."

03:15:27.500 --> 03:15:29.000
TRAVIS: Mattâ€™s Vineyard is the best.

03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:31.320
MATT: "Thank you, Grog,
it's wondrous."

03:15:31.320 --> 03:15:34.000
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:37.670
MATT: "But his mass,

03:15:37.670 --> 03:15:44.270
"his unforeseen size

03:15:44.270 --> 03:15:48.510

that within his torso

LAURA: All right.

03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:04.000
TALIESIN: Look how clever
food makes all of us.

03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:06.000
MATT: He looks over to Allura. 
Allura nods.

03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:08.000
"Well, if that is the case,
then it's, I think,

03:16:08.000 --> 03:16:10.000
"there's very much a chance

03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:14.000
"that he did escape
with the heart-stone intact."

03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:17.000
TRAVIS: I have a question.

03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:19.000
We've got one of the Vestiges

03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:24.000
in these Titanstone Knuckles,
made from the heart-stone.

03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:27.000
If I left the plane with these,

03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:30.120
are they gonna blow everybody up?

03:16:30.120 --> 03:16:35.000
MATT: "An intact heart-stone
is the true source of power.

03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:38.610
"Those have been carved from one,
an inert one, or, at least,

03:16:38.610 --> 03:16:40.500
"they carry but a smidgen of the power.

03:16:40.500 --> 03:16:42.000
"I think you're safe, Grog."

03:16:42.000 --> 03:16:45.000
TRAVIS: Oh, thank god.
ASHLEY: Phew.

03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:47.000
LAURA: Which one?

03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:50.500
TRAVIS: Kord.
LAURA: Oh, Kord. I got it. (chuckles)

03:16:50.500 --> 03:16:51.970
MATT: Allura leans in again.

03:16:51.970 --> 03:16:57.000
"I have been keeping an eye on Emon
from this distance, as well.

03:16:57.000 --> 03:17:00.000
"It seems that Thordak's very essence

03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:02.000
"twists the land with elemental magic."

03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:03.460
TRAVIS: (whispering) Oh, shit.

03:17:03.460 --> 03:17:05.500
MATT: "My distant views of the city

03:17:05.500 --> 03:17:09.000
"have shown the center of the town
cracked with volcanic fire

03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:13.000
"as he digs and burrows
beneath the city itself."

03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:16.000
TALIESIN: (whispering) Fuck.
LAURA: Oh, fuck.

03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:18.000
TRAVIS: Wait, why is he
digging and burrowing?

03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:21.000
LIAM: He's reshaping the land
as he sees fit.

03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:22.500
TRAVIS: Or is he looking for something?
LAURA: Because he's a dick.

03:17:22.500 --> 03:17:24.000
TRAVIS: Is he not
looking for something?

03:17:24.000 --> 03:17:26.000
TALIESIN: He might be
looking for something,

03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:27.500
or might be making--

03:17:27.500 --> 03:17:29.000
MARISHA: So these heart-stones

03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:33.310
embrace the essence 
of where they reside?

03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:39.000
MATT: "Their essence
is created where they reside."

03:17:39.000 --> 03:17:42.860
MARISHA: And he has the heart-stone
of the Fire Elemental Plane

03:17:42.860 --> 03:17:45.000
living inside of him.

03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:51.000
MATT: "A heart-stone. There are many."
MARISHA: A heart-stone. Right.

03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:52.500
LAURA: I'm confused.

03:17:52.500 --> 03:17:54.000
TRAVIS: I need more wine.

03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:55.500
Do you think he was
just making himself at home,

03:17:55.500 --> 03:17:58.000
or do you think he was
looking for something?

03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:00.500
MATT: "I don't know.
He seems pretty lax.

03:18:00.500 --> 03:18:02.000
"From what I could tell
from my investigations,

03:18:02.000 --> 03:18:04.000
"the major step
in the Conclave's plan

03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:06.000
"is already over."

03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:07.500
LAURA: Take over everything.

03:18:07.500 --> 03:18:09.650
MATT: "Now they settle
into the divided territories

03:18:09.650 --> 03:18:12.000
"and forget each other.

03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:15.810
"Now, I feel that Thordak
is far too old and covetous

03:18:15.810 --> 03:18:19.000
"to be content with just Emon.

03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:22.000
"Now, this was vengeance,
which is now complete.

03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:24.500
"Who knows what the next stage
in his terrible design is."

03:18:24.500 --> 03:18:26.000
MARISHA: So you're thinking

03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:29.000
the Chroma Conclave
was simply a temporary alliance?

03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:32.000
MATT: "There are very few

03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:35.500
"permanent alliances 
between chromatic dragons."

03:18:35.500 --> 03:18:37.550
LAURA: Well, that's good.
MARISHA: We can use this.

03:18:37.550 --> 03:18:40.000
LAURA: Maybe they won't take vengeance.

03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:42.000
ASHLEY: Maybe we can get one of them
on our side.

03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:44.000
TALIESIN: We can only be so hopeful
that they tear each other apart.

03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:49.000
LAURA: Maybe the white one will want
to help kill Thordak with us.

03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:53.000
MARISHA: Turning them against each other
is not a bad idea.

03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:56.000
TALIESIN: Our best hope, at this point,
is just to amass power.

03:18:56.000 --> 03:18:57.500
We are not strong enough.

03:18:57.500 --> 03:18:59.000
LAURA: No.

03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:01.000
TALIESIN: But we will get stronger.

03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:05.500
LAURA: Does the heart-stone make him
even stronger than he already was?

03:19:05.500 --> 03:19:07.000
MATT: "I don't know,

03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:09.500
"but he was not that large
when we sealed him."

03:19:09.500 --> 03:19:11.000
LAURA: Shit.
TRAVIS: Seize.

03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:13.000
MARISHA: So we can take-- yeah.

03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:17.000
LAURA: If we can pry it
out of his body,

03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:18.500
we could shrink him down.

03:19:18.500 --> 03:19:20.000
Perfect plan.

03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:22.000
SAM: Then we could go
inside a dragon again.

03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:23.650
LAURA: We can go in another dragon.

03:19:23.650 --> 03:19:25.210
LIAM: Every one of them,
one after the other.

03:19:25.210 --> 03:19:27.000
TRAVIS: You seen any dragons
on the outskirts of the town?

03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:30.000
Have there been any flyovers
or close calls within, say,

03:19:30.000 --> 03:19:34.500
50 to 100 miles or so?
Any reports?

03:19:34.500 --> 03:19:36.000
MATT: "Hundred miles.

03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:39.000
"There were reports
of the white dragon a week ago,

03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:41.000
"south of us. Far south of us."

03:19:41.000 --> 03:19:43.000
TRAVIS: Far south.

03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:45.000
LAURA: Doing what, just flying?

03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:48.020
MATT: "Just flying. Flying east."

03:19:48.020 --> 03:19:50.000
TALIESIN: Unless they know
what's underneath the castle,

03:19:50.000 --> 03:19:53.000
there's nothing of value here.

03:19:53.000 --> 03:19:58.500
LIAM: Do we know where Vorugal
has taken up roost? No one knows?

03:19:58.500 --> 03:20:00.000
MATT: "No. I've tried to scry,

03:20:00.000 --> 03:20:04.000
"but they're apparently
protected against that now."

03:20:04.000 --> 03:20:07.000
TRAVIS: What about
means of protection for Whitestone.

03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:10.000
Do you have a defense planned?
A warning system?

03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:12.500
MATT: "We're just getting now
to that point.

03:20:12.500 --> 03:20:16.000
"It may be a few weeks
before we're ready to go.

03:20:16.000 --> 03:20:18.000
"It's a lot to build
and it's a very big space to protect,

03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:23.000
"but me and Drake
are working on some ideas. (sighs)"

03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:25.870
MARISHA: Do you know exactly how
these heart-stones are forged?

03:20:25.870 --> 03:20:30.000
MATT: "They're not forged.
They existed.

03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:32.000
"They were the hearts
of the primordial titans

03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:35.000
"that existed on this world
before the gods even came here."

03:20:35.000 --> 03:20:37.000
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.
LAURA: Wow.

03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:40.120
MATT: "They were the true denizens
of this world, before any of us."

03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:48.000
SAM: This is an awesome dinner,
by the way. Super good.

03:20:48.000 --> 03:20:51.000
LAURA: So good.
TALIESIN: I love game meat.

03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:55.000
MATT: "I'm sorry,
it's been a very tense time."

03:20:55.000 --> 03:20:58.000
LAURA: This wine is pretty good.
ASHLEY: It's very good.

03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:01.000
MATT: "Perhaps rest is in order
for all of us.

03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:03.580
"It's been a lot. I'm so sorry.
It's good to see all of you."

03:21:03.580 --> 03:21:05.220
TRAVIS: You, as well.
LAURA: You've done so much.

03:21:05.220 --> 03:21:08.000
MATT: Allura brightens up a little bit.
You can see that she feels guilty

03:21:08.000 --> 03:21:10.000
that she just did
this information dump and is like,

03:21:10.000 --> 03:21:13.000
"(sighs) It's good
to see all of you."

03:21:13.000 --> 03:21:15.000
MARISHA: It was good to see you.

03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:17.000
MATT: "(sighs) Well,
let us rest for the evening."

03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:19.500
Drinks the last of her wine,
stands up.

03:21:19.500 --> 03:21:21.000
"We'll talk on the morrow."

03:21:21.000 --> 03:21:23.000
She gets up. "Kima?"

03:21:23.000 --> 03:21:25.000
"I'm coming, let me finish."

03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:27.000
LAURA AND MARISHA: (laugh)

03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:29.000
MATT: "No, seriously,
it's good to see you all.

03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:30.500
"I'm glad you're all right."

03:21:30.500 --> 03:21:32.150
LAURA: You should have been with us.

03:21:32.150 --> 03:21:34.590
MATT: "I should've been with you.
I didn't know you left!"

03:21:34.590 --> 03:21:36.500
LAURA: Sorry, Kima. We're dicks.

03:21:36.500 --> 03:21:38.000
MATT: "Is Westruun okay?"

03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:40.790
LAURA: It's... better.

03:21:40.790 --> 03:21:43.000
MARISHA: (whispering)
It's not great, though.

03:21:43.000 --> 03:21:46.000
LAURA: It's getting better.
TALIESIN: It lives. It lives.

03:21:46.000 --> 03:21:48.500
SAM: That's true.
MARISHA: It stands.

03:21:48.500 --> 03:21:50.420
MATT: "Does my house still stand?"

03:21:50.420 --> 03:21:53.000
(hesitant noises)

03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:56.500
SAM: What's a house, really,
but a bunch of bricks.

03:21:56.500 --> 03:21:58.000
MATT: "Oh, it's fine."

03:21:58.000 --> 03:22:00.410
MARISHA: Home is
where you make it, Kima.

03:22:00.410 --> 03:22:03.560
MATT: "Object impermanence.
(glug glug)

03:22:03.560 --> 03:22:06.500
"Next time you're going there,
you tell me."

03:22:06.500 --> 03:22:08.000
LAURA: Oh, yes. We will.

03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:10.000
TALIESIN: We will be returning.

03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:13.000
TRAVIS: On one condition.
Don't wear any more dresses.

03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:15.000
LAURA: (laughs)

03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:18.220
MATT: "You saying
I wasn't pretty, Grog?"

03:22:18.220 --> 03:22:21.090
TRAVIS: I like you
in your armor better.

03:22:21.090 --> 03:22:23.000
MATT: "That's why I missed you."

03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:25.000
She reaches out
and smacks your cheek.

03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:27.000
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:22:27.000 --> 03:22:29.000
(laughter)

03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:32.000
MATT: "All right, kiddies,
sleep it is."

03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:35.000
Kima gets up and joins Allura,
and they both leave.

03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:40.000
Gilmore stands up,
Realmseer stands up.

03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:46.000
"All right, everyone.
Rest well. See you in the morning.

03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:48.970
"And, ah, glad you're all safe."

03:22:48.970 --> 03:22:52.670
LIAM: Good night, Shaun.
MATT: "Good night, everyone."

03:22:52.670 --> 03:22:54.350
ASHLEY: Good night, Gilmore.
MATT: "Sleep well."

03:22:54.350 --> 03:22:57.000
MATT: They all leave.

03:22:57.000 --> 03:22:59.000
SAM: So we rest here
for a night or two

03:22:59.000 --> 03:23:01.000
and then, to the Feywild?

03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:02.500
TRAVIS: Yeah, Feywild.

03:23:02.500 --> 03:23:04.000
SAM: Or to the--

03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:10.500
TRAVIS: We even have a geographic--
demographic location to like--

03:23:10.500 --> 03:23:12.000
SAM: True.
MARISHA: We do.

03:23:12.000 --> 03:23:14.470
TALIESIN: I feel like 
the Feywild calls to us.

03:23:14.470 --> 03:23:17.000
LIAM: What do you say
we go get you a new bow?

03:23:17.000 --> 03:23:19.500
LAURA: We could go get me a new bow.
There's also the ocean.

03:23:19.500 --> 03:23:20.500
SAM: Yeah.

03:23:20.500 --> 03:23:23.160
LIAM: Nah. Let's get you a bow.
MARISHA: Let's go get you a bow.

03:23:23.160 --> 03:23:25.190
ASHLEY: I'm going
to pour another glass of wine.

03:23:25.190 --> 03:23:27.000
TALIESIN: Ocean next.

03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:30.000
SAM: Pike could go off
to get the ocean one herself.

03:23:30.000 --> 03:23:33.000
LAURA: No! You're crazy.
LIAM: That's a shitty idea.

03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:35.000
MATT: (laughs)

03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:37.500
TRAVIS: I think you've had
too much to drink, Scanlan.

03:23:37.500 --> 03:23:39.420
LAURA: Or the two of you together.

03:23:39.420 --> 03:23:42.490
SAM: Yeah, I like the ocean.
I don't really like the ocean.

03:23:42.490 --> 03:23:44.500
(laughter)

03:23:44.500 --> 03:23:46.000
MATT: You guys all going to rest?

03:23:46.000 --> 03:23:47.500
MARISHA: I have one thing I'd like to do.

03:23:47.500 --> 03:23:49.000
MATT: Okay, what do you want to do?

03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:51.000
MARISHA: I want to go back

03:23:51.000 --> 03:23:53.500
to our little cave that we dug out
under where the Sun Tree is.

03:23:53.500 --> 03:23:55.000
Is that still there?

03:23:55.000 --> 03:23:56.500
MATT: Yeah, it's still there.

03:23:56.500 --> 03:23:58.000
MARISHA: I want to go there,

03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:01.000
and I want to kind of sit down
and meditate for a second.

03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:07.000
And I want to cast Speak With Plants

03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:11.000
and have a little chat
with the Sun Tree.

03:24:11.000 --> 03:24:14.000
MATT: Okay. (laughs)
You cast the spell,

03:24:14.000 --> 03:24:16.000
you reach out
and touch the roots of the tree,

03:24:16.000 --> 03:24:18.230
the roots of which have more color
than they did before.

03:24:18.230 --> 03:24:22.000
The dull gray has become
more of a full brown.

03:24:22.000 --> 03:24:26.000
The earth here smells of fresh,
damp earth.

03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:28.900
The tree, while still
in the winter phase,

03:24:28.900 --> 03:24:34.000
is definitely teeming with life,
to where it once didn't.

03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:36.000
MARISHA: I reach out
and I touch the roots.

03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:41.000
Can I just kind of feel,
sense the arcane ley-lines

03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:46.000
that Allura was talking about
that the tree's in the center of?

03:24:46.000 --> 03:24:51.000
MATT: Mmm... not really.

03:24:51.000 --> 03:24:56.550
In speaking to the tree,
you can ask questions,

03:24:56.550 --> 03:25:00.000
but you're not quite--

03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:02.000
you find yourself unable
to tune into that

03:25:02.000 --> 03:25:06.000
or tap into that source of magic.

03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:08.000
At this place, at least.

03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:12.530
MARISHA: Okay. So I just reach out,
touch the tree, and say,

03:25:12.530 --> 03:25:17.780
"Hey, old friend.

03:25:17.780 --> 03:25:22.000
"How are you feeling? Doing better?"

03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:25.080
MATT: "Hey, bud. Much better."

03:25:25.080 --> 03:25:27.000
(laughter)

03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:29.000
MARISHA: You're pretty cool, Sun Tree.

03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:30.500
MATT: "Sun Tree, A-OK."

03:25:30.500 --> 03:25:37.000
(laughter)

03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:39.000
MARISHA: Hey, Sun Tree?

03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:44.000
MATT: "Yeah?"

03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:47.000
MARISHA: I was just wondering
if you knew--

03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:49.000
if you could tell me anything
about this

03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:51.000
terrible cancerous tree
in the Feywild,

03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:52.500
if you knew anything about it?

03:25:52.500 --> 03:25:54.000
He might be like
your brother or something.

03:25:54.000 --> 03:25:55.500
MATT: "Tree cancer? What?"

03:25:55.500 --> 03:25:57.000
MARISHA: No! No, okay.

03:25:57.000 --> 03:26:01.000
There's this tree in the Feywild
and it might have

03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:05.000
a man living in it
called Fenthras.

03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:06.500
TRAVIS: (quietly) The bow.

03:26:06.500 --> 03:26:08.630
MARISHA: No, sorry,
that's the name of the bow,

03:26:08.630 --> 03:26:14.000
the bow is in it, named Fenthras,
and it might be a really sick tree.

03:26:14.000 --> 03:26:17.020
Can you tell me where there's
a really sick tree, maybe in the Feywild?

03:26:17.020 --> 03:26:19.000
MATT: "That sounds sad, but no.

03:26:19.000 --> 03:26:21.000
"I don't know
a tree like that, sorry.

03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:23.000
"I've been here in Whitestone
since day one."

03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:26.000
(laughter)

03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:30.000
LIAM: Want to play hacky sack?
TALIESIN: Born and raised.

03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:32.810
MATT: So I graduated from Berkeley
and made my way to Whitestone.

03:26:32.810 --> 03:26:34.000
(laughter)

03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:35.960
TRAVIS: My twigs smoke the doob.

03:26:35.960 --> 03:26:38.000
SAM: "Barkeley."
MARISHA: "Barkeley!"

03:26:38.000 --> 03:26:39.500
ASHLEY: Put a pair of Birkenstocks
on its branches.

03:26:39.500 --> 03:26:41.000
TRAVIS: "Birkenstalks."
MATT: (groans)

03:26:41.000 --> 03:26:42.820
LAURA: "Birkenstalks?" I like it.

03:26:42.820 --> 03:26:44.380
MARISHA: Hey, Sun Tree?

03:26:44.380 --> 03:26:46.220
MATT: "Yeah?"

03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:51.000
MARISHA: You apparently kind of live

03:26:51.000 --> 03:26:55.000
in the middle of all these
arcane ley-lines of the world.

03:26:55.000 --> 03:26:57.500
MATT: "Yeah."
TALIESIN: (cracks up)

03:26:57.500 --> 03:26:59.000
MARISHA: How far do those stretch?

03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:03.000
MATT: "Long way, Kiki.

03:27:03.000 --> 03:27:07.000
"Long way."

03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:10.000
(laughter)

03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:12.500
MARISHA: Can you kind of give me
a rough idea?

03:27:12.500 --> 03:27:14.830
Do they go
to the other side of the world?

03:27:14.830 --> 03:27:18.000
Can you stretch all over the world?

03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:22.000
MATT: "Nah, just right here.
Pelor put me here for a reason."

03:27:22.000 --> 03:27:25.000
MARISHA: Who? Pelor?
MATT: "Yeah."

03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:27.000
MARISHA: Right.

03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:31.100
So you're not a natural tree,
you're a tree from the gods?

03:27:32.550 --> 03:27:33.880
MATT: "Sure."

03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:38.000
MARISHA: All right.

03:27:38.000 --> 03:27:40.740
Well, anyway,
you're really awesome, Sun Tree.

03:27:40.740 --> 03:27:42.670
MATT: "Speak for yourself, Kiki."

03:27:42.670 --> 03:27:46.000
MARISHA: Yeah, you're so cool.

03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:48.000
Okay, so it was good talking to you.

03:27:48.000 --> 03:27:49.980
MATT: "You, too."

03:27:51.170 --> 03:27:54.000
MARISHA: I'll walk through you soon.
Okay, bye.

03:27:54.000 --> 03:27:56.000
MATT: (laughs)

03:27:56.000 --> 03:27:57.500
MARISHA: And then I leave.
MATT: All right.

03:27:57.500 --> 03:28:00.830
LAURA: I want to make a once-over on Vax
and make sure that--

03:28:00.830 --> 03:28:02.800
So you did,
you got all the blood off, then?

03:28:02.800 --> 03:28:04.200
LIAM: What are you doing?
Yeah, I took a bath.

03:28:04.200 --> 03:28:05.500
LAURA: I mean,
we got all cleaned up for tonight.

03:28:05.500 --> 03:28:07.000
I just want to make sure
you didn't ruin it

03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:09.000
by keeping some of the blood
in your freaking hair.

03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:11.440
LIAM: Don't I look all right?
I'm fine! What's your problem?

03:28:11.440 --> 03:28:13.830
LAURA: Nothing! Just making sure
you're doing all right.

03:28:13.830 --> 03:28:15.000
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: All the blood's gone.

03:28:15.000 --> 03:28:17.000
LIAM: Yeah. It's all gone.
LAURA: You're great.

03:28:17.000 --> 03:28:19.000
LIAM: I'm doing much better.
LAURA: Good.

03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:22.000
LIAM: Much better.

03:28:22.000 --> 03:28:23.500
You ready for the Feywild?

03:28:23.500 --> 03:28:28.000
LAURA: Fuck, no, not ready,
but we can do it.

03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:29.420
LIAM: Oh.

03:28:32.000 --> 03:28:34.000
TALIESIN: Stupid to settle.
MARISHA: (snorts)

03:28:34.000 --> 03:28:35.500
LAURA: I walk over to Percy.

03:28:35.500 --> 03:28:37.000
TALIESIN: I was about
to walk out the door,

03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:39.000
but if you're walking--

03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:42.000
LAURA: Before you leave,
I whisper in your ear,

03:28:42.000 --> 03:28:44.000
"You still have
a little blood behind your ear."

03:28:44.000 --> 03:28:45.000
TRAVIS: (gasps)

03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:47.630
TALIESIN: Do you want 
to take a walk with me?

03:28:47.630 --> 03:28:53.000
LAURA: (sighs) Sure.

03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:55.000
TALIESIN: We take a very quiet walk
around Whitestone.

03:28:55.000 --> 03:28:56.500
I want to pass all of the temples

03:28:56.500 --> 03:29:01.000
that are either
still standing or destroyed.

03:29:01.000 --> 03:29:03.000
I just want to take a temple tour.

03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:05.980
Not stopping, not talking,
I just want to see what they look like.

03:29:05.980 --> 03:29:10.000
Pelor looks good.
The one in the cemetery?

03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:12.000
MATT: The one in the cemetery
is still under construction.

03:29:12.000 --> 03:29:14.000
That one needs a little more work.

03:29:14.000 --> 03:29:16.000
TALIESIN: While in the cemetery--

03:29:16.000 --> 03:29:19.000
I assume that it's still a mess.

03:29:19.000 --> 03:29:21.000
MATT: Most of the graves
have been refilled,

03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:23.000
the corpses have been brought back.

03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:27.000
Most of the dead that were brought forth
from the previous owners

03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:28.500
have been returned.

03:29:28.500 --> 03:29:30.000
That was one of the first
orders of business

03:29:30.000 --> 03:29:32.000
that people who live here did,

03:29:32.000 --> 03:29:34.000
was to return their families
to the earth.

03:29:34.000 --> 03:29:37.400
TALIESIN: There were
a couple of lords' crypts in there.

03:29:37.400 --> 03:29:41.000
Was there an Anders family crypt, 
at one point?

03:29:41.000 --> 03:29:43.000
MATT: There would have been, yeah.

03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:45.000
TALIESIN: Cool. All right.

03:29:45.000 --> 03:29:47.460
I'm going to walk back to the castle,

03:29:47.460 --> 03:29:50.000
with you in tow,
and I'm going to find Zahra.

03:29:50.000 --> 03:29:53.000
MATT: Okay.

03:29:53.000 --> 03:29:56.000
LAURA: Are you going to tell me
why you went and saw the Raven Queen?

03:29:56.000 --> 03:29:57.500
TALIESIN: Yes. Come.

03:29:57.500 --> 03:29:59.000
MATT: All right.

03:29:59.000 --> 03:30:02.510
You come back to the study
where you originally found Zahra.

03:30:02.510 --> 03:30:05.010
She's still there poring over books,
but is now half-asleep.

03:30:05.010 --> 03:30:07.000
She has a little candle
that's starting to flicker out

03:30:07.000 --> 03:30:10.000
and she has her feet up on the desk
and her tail's kind of curled up

03:30:10.000 --> 03:30:13.000
and she's falling asleep
into the book as you walk in.

03:30:13.000 --> 03:30:15.000
LAURA: (whispering) Dear--
MATT: "What?"

03:30:15.000 --> 03:30:18.000
LAURA: We all need sleep sometimes, hon.

03:30:18.000 --> 03:30:22.000
MATT: "Sleep's for the boring."

03:30:22.000 --> 03:30:23.500
TALIESIN: I have a task for you,

03:30:23.500 --> 03:30:30.000
if you have the time and energy
for something a bit quiet, but necessary.

03:30:30.000 --> 03:30:32.000
MATT: "What do you ask, Percy?"

03:30:32.000 --> 03:30:33.500
TALIESIN: I'm going to have
the deeds

03:30:33.500 --> 03:30:38.000
to the Anders family crypt
transferred to your name.

03:30:38.000 --> 03:30:40.000
I want you to clean it out.

03:30:40.000 --> 03:30:43.000
Throw the bodies wherever;
he has disgraced himself.

03:30:43.000 --> 03:30:46.000
Clean them.

03:30:46.000 --> 03:30:48.000
And if you can,
if you can find people who can do it,

03:30:48.000 --> 03:30:50.000
I want to very quietly,
in that crypt,

03:30:50.000 --> 03:30:55.380
create a small shrine
to the Raven Queen.

03:30:57.000 --> 03:30:58.500
This will help.

03:30:58.500 --> 03:31:02.000
And I bring out
the vial of blood from the pit.

03:31:02.000 --> 03:31:05.000
Perhaps they will know
what to do with that.

03:31:05.000 --> 03:31:06.000
MATT: "Intriguing."

03:31:06.000 --> 03:31:08.000
TALIESIN: But I would like her
to have a quiet mark in this city.

03:31:08.000 --> 03:31:09.910
LAURA: Is this for you,
or for my brother?

03:31:12.000 --> 03:31:16.000
TALIESIN: ...It's for your brother,
so that he can help us.

03:31:16.000 --> 03:31:21.000
We're apparently all in this together.

03:31:21.000 --> 03:31:23.560
LAURA: I give Percy a kiss on the cheek.

03:31:23.560 --> 03:31:29.000
TALIESIN: Oh. Thank you.
MATT: "All right."

03:31:29.000 --> 03:31:31.000
TALIESIN: We need all the help we can get.

03:31:31.000 --> 03:31:34.000
MATT: "Very well.
I'm sure it can be done.

03:31:34.000 --> 03:31:36.000
"I never owned a crypt before.
I'm excited."

03:31:36.000 --> 03:31:38.000
LAURA: It's exciting. (laughs)

03:31:38.000 --> 03:31:40.000
MATT: She takes the vial
and puts it on the table.

03:31:40.000 --> 03:31:41.480
LAURA: I think it suits you.

03:31:41.480 --> 03:31:45.000
TALIESIN: Tell anyone you'd like
where I went. It's not a secret.

03:31:45.000 --> 03:31:47.510
I just wasn't ready to...

03:31:50.000 --> 03:31:53.000
I don't think your brother--

03:31:53.000 --> 03:31:55.000
I would hate for him
to think I'm competing.

03:31:55.000 --> 03:31:57.500
I just had some questions.

03:31:57.500 --> 03:31:59.000
LAURA: I won't tell anyone, Percy.

03:31:59.000 --> 03:32:00.500
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:32:00.500 --> 03:32:02.000
LAURA: Your business is yours.

03:32:02.000 --> 03:32:04.000
And mine, because I noticed. 
(chuckles)

03:32:04.000 --> 03:32:05.000
MARISHA: (snorts)

03:32:05.000 --> 03:32:09.000
TALIESIN: Thank you for noticing,
and... I'm trying hard

03:32:09.000 --> 03:32:12.000
not to make it my business.

03:32:12.000 --> 03:32:15.000
It's hard to remember sometimes.

03:32:15.000 --> 03:32:18.000
TALIESIN: (sighs)
LAURA: (quietly) We're all family.

03:32:18.000 --> 03:32:23.000
TALIESIN: That's awful, isn't it. 
(sighs)

03:32:23.000 --> 03:32:25.000
I'm going to go to my room--

03:32:25.000 --> 03:32:27.000
LAURA: Oh! Percy!
TALIESIN: Yes?

03:32:27.000 --> 03:32:28.000
LAURA: Sorry.

03:32:28.000 --> 03:32:30.000
If Zahra wanted to make
some dragon arrows,

03:32:30.000 --> 03:32:33.000
could she use stuff here
in the castle?

03:32:33.000 --> 03:32:35.390
TALIESIN: I'll talk to my sister
on the way out.

03:32:35.390 --> 03:32:37.000
I'll write her a letter
and see if they can--

03:32:37.000 --> 03:32:39.000
they may have to delve
into our materials for it,

03:32:39.000 --> 03:32:41.000
but I think we're good.

03:32:41.000 --> 03:32:42.000
LAURA: Yes.

03:32:42.000 --> 03:32:45.000
TALIESIN: We'll talk about
using our materials for such a thing,

03:32:45.000 --> 03:32:48.000
and I will talk to her about that.

03:32:48.000 --> 03:32:50.000
LAURA: All right.

03:32:50.000 --> 03:32:52.000
TALIESIN: I'm going to do
my little thing and if it works, great,

03:32:52.000 --> 03:32:55.000
and if not,
we'll speak not of it for a while.

03:32:55.000 --> 03:32:57.490
MATT: Okay. Go ahead
and make your tinkering check.

03:33:00.000 --> 03:33:04.000
TALIESIN: Better! 30.

03:33:04.000 --> 03:33:06.000
MATT: That'll do.

03:33:06.000 --> 03:33:08.000
TALIESIN: I craft a brooch.

03:33:08.000 --> 03:33:11.000
It's not even a brooch,
it's a clasp.

03:33:11.000 --> 03:33:15.000
I had built these pieces of it
earlier on in the game.

03:33:15.000 --> 03:33:17.000
For the last three weeks
I've been working on this.

03:33:17.000 --> 03:33:20.000
I've taken the raven skull
that you gave me

03:33:20.000 --> 03:33:22.000
and made a mold

03:33:22.000 --> 03:33:25.000
and poured melted silver
into a bird skull,

03:33:25.000 --> 03:33:26.500
a silver bird skull.

03:33:26.500 --> 03:33:29.000
Taken a ruby and set it behind it,

03:33:29.000 --> 03:33:33.000
built it into a clasp
that does not reflect,

03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:38.000
and in it,
put a sachet of-- satchel...

03:33:38.000 --> 03:33:40.000
MARISHA and LAURA: Sachet.

03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:44.000
TALIESIN: Thank you. My brain? Coffee.

03:33:44.000 --> 03:33:47.310
Of myrrh and--

03:33:47.310 --> 03:33:49.000
SAM: Frankincense?

03:33:49.000 --> 03:33:55.000
TALIESIN: (snorts and laughs)
Myrrh, sandalwood, opium,

03:33:55.000 --> 03:33:58.000
and dragon's blood.

03:33:58.000 --> 03:34:01.000
Not real dragon's blood,
but dragon's blood--

03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:02.000
SAM: True blood.

03:34:02.000 --> 03:34:04.000
TALIESIN: Sap. It's a sap.
It's a tree sap.

03:34:04.000 --> 03:34:06.000
Put the whole thing together.

03:34:06.000 --> 03:34:08.000
LIAM: You've had opium
this whole time and you never...

03:34:08.000 --> 03:34:11.000
TALIESIN: It's not, it's just poppy.

03:34:11.000 --> 03:34:12.500
LAURA: What does it do?

03:34:12.500 --> 03:34:16.000
TALIESIN: You will find out
when I present it.

03:34:16.000 --> 03:34:18.000
MATT: All right.
Everyone else going to rest?

03:34:18.000 --> 03:34:21.000
TRAVIS: No.
I ran out of dinner super fast

03:34:21.000 --> 03:34:23.000
and I ran outside of Vax's room

03:34:23.000 --> 03:34:27.000
and I took the jug
and I whispered into it, "oil,"

03:34:27.000 --> 03:34:30.000
and I poured one quart of oil

03:34:30.000 --> 03:34:32.000
on the ground outside of his door.

03:34:32.000 --> 03:34:34.000
Looked around real quick.

03:34:34.000 --> 03:34:35.500
Is there anyone in the hallway?

03:34:35.500 --> 03:34:37.440
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:34:41.000 --> 03:34:42.500
TRAVIS: 10.

03:34:42.500 --> 03:34:44.500
MATT: Looks clear.

03:34:44.500 --> 03:34:45.490
TRAVIS: (giggles)

03:34:45.490 --> 03:34:46.826
And I run away.

03:34:46.826 --> 03:34:48.163
(laughter)

03:34:48.163 --> 03:34:49.270
MATT: All righty.

03:34:49.270 --> 03:34:51.500
LIAM: That was super awesome
and I can't wait to see the outcome,

03:34:51.500 --> 03:34:53.000
but before that happens,

03:34:53.000 --> 03:34:56.450
I was standing right here
when these two walked off,

03:34:56.450 --> 03:35:03.000
so I am waiting in the exact same spot
for my sister to return.

03:35:03.000 --> 03:35:04.500
MATT: A lot of time passes.
LIAM: It's fine.

03:35:04.500 --> 03:35:06.000
MATT: A few hours pass
before she returns,

03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:08.310
but she eventually does.

03:35:08.310 --> 03:35:11.000
LAURA: Are you still here?
You should go to bed.

03:35:11.000 --> 03:35:14.000
LIAM: I will.
I took a little bit of a nap.

03:35:14.000 --> 03:35:16.000
LAURA: In the dining hall?

03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:18.000
LIAM: Yeah.

03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:19.740
LAURA: What?

03:35:23.000 --> 03:35:25.960
LIAM: You're a grown-ass woman,
and you're twice as strong as I am.

03:35:25.960 --> 03:35:26.830
LAURA: I know.

03:35:26.830 --> 03:35:29.980
LIAM: So your business is your business.

03:35:29.980 --> 03:35:34.460
Just... both eyes open, yeah?

03:35:34.460 --> 03:35:40.590
LAURA: Always. (chuckles)
I'm very perceptive.

03:35:42.000 --> 03:35:44.000
LAURA: (cackles)
LIAM: Don't do that to me.

03:35:44.000 --> 03:35:45.960
TALIESIN: That's two.
Two winks! Ah hah hah.

03:35:45.960 --> 03:35:48.490
LIAM: Please don't ever
do that to me again.

03:35:48.490 --> 03:35:51.000
LAURA: I love you so much.

03:35:51.000 --> 03:35:55.020
LIAM: And if you do, you will 
never use that wink on me again.

03:35:55.020 --> 03:35:57.000
It is not for me.

03:35:57.000 --> 03:35:58.560
LAURA: All right.

03:35:58.560 --> 03:36:04.000
LIAM: Just... he's charming,
but both eyes open, please.

03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:05.500
LAURA: I don't know
what you are talking about.

03:36:05.500 --> 03:36:06.740
LIAM: Yeah, the fuck you don't.

03:36:06.740 --> 03:36:10.020
I'm going to go to my room now
and see if I splat on the floor.

03:36:10.020 --> 03:36:14.000
MATT: All right, make a perception check.

03:36:14.000 --> 03:36:16.000
TRAVIS: Come on, big money, no whammies.

03:36:16.000 --> 03:36:19.000
(laughter)

03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:22.600
LAURA: Ohhh.
LIAM: Sorry, buddy, it's a 31.

03:36:22.600 --> 03:36:25.000
MATT: As you approach the door,
you look down

03:36:25.000 --> 03:36:28.000
and see a smear of dark,
reflective oil

03:36:28.000 --> 03:36:33.000
across the walkway about two feet 
leading up to your room.

03:36:33.000 --> 03:36:36.000
You guys have a cluster of rooms
in this long hallway,

03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:38.000
and it arcs around like an L.

03:36:38.000 --> 03:36:39.500
So you guys are in this big L

03:36:39.500 --> 03:36:42.000
of all your rooms scattered throughout.

03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:44.000
LIAM: How thick is it? Is it viscous?

03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:48.000
MATT: Yeah, it's pretty slippery.
LIAM: Put my hand in it. Does that stay?

03:36:48.000 --> 03:36:51.000
MATT: The hand stays for a minute, then--
LIAM: Goes away.

03:36:51.000 --> 03:36:53.710
MATT: Yeah, it's pretty thick.
LIAM: All right.

03:36:56.000 --> 03:36:59.000
MATT: Also has a fume to it.

03:36:59.000 --> 03:37:00.000
LIAM: Okay.

03:37:00.000 --> 03:37:02.000
I'm going to scrape
a bunch of it up just into my hand,

03:37:02.000 --> 03:37:05.000
so I have a big handful of it,

03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:08.000
and I'm just going
to go to Grog's room,

03:37:08.000 --> 03:37:11.000
and I'm going to slowly,
just at the door, take time to write,

03:37:11.000 --> 03:37:16.000
Grog smells

03:37:16.000 --> 03:37:22.200
like farts and--

03:37:22.200 --> 03:37:25.000
LAURA: I walk by him
as he's doing this and say,

03:37:25.000 --> 03:37:27.000
You know he can't read, right?

03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:29.000
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:37:29.000 --> 03:37:31.000
LIAM: I picked specifically small words!

03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:33.000
(laughter)

03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:34.500
LIAM: Poo.

03:37:34.500 --> 03:37:36.000
TALIESIN: Oh, he can read that.

03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:37.000
LIAM: And I draw--

03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:41.980
No. I'll tell you what I do.
Pull down my breeches

03:37:41.980 --> 03:37:44.500
and I put the oil on my butt
and I go (squelch).

03:37:44.500 --> 03:37:46.000
(laughter)

03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:48.000
LIAM: A little signature.

03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:51.050
MATT: All right. Well done.

03:37:53.000 --> 03:37:55.000
TALIESIN: Preschoolers run amok
in my gentle abode.

03:37:55.000 --> 03:37:59.000
LIAM: Get busy living
or get busy dying. Butt-print.

03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:00.490
MATT: All right.
You guys all get into bed.

03:38:00.490 --> 03:38:02.060
Anything else you want to get done?

03:38:02.060 --> 03:38:04.600
SAM: I just told Pike
she looked real pretty tonight

03:38:04.600 --> 03:38:06.950
and I go back to my reading.

03:38:06.950 --> 03:38:08.000
MATT: Okay.

03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:12.000
You guys all find yourselves
back to your respective rooms,

03:38:12.000 --> 03:38:13.500
resting for the night.

03:38:13.500 --> 03:38:17.180
Some doors
adorned differently than others.

03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:22.000
Partway into the evening's resting,

03:38:22.000 --> 03:38:27.000
we'll say the wee hours of the morning,
post-midnight or so,

03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:31.570
your door opens slightly, Vax.

03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:38.450
You hear a little
(knocking sound) on your door.

03:38:39.440 --> 03:38:41.100
LIAM: Yes?

03:38:41.100 --> 03:38:45.440
MATT: You look over and you see Gilmore
pop his head in with a soft smile.

03:38:46.910 --> 03:38:51.600
"I'm sorry if I'm waking you up."

03:38:52.880 --> 03:38:54.210
LIAM: It's all right.

03:38:54.210 --> 03:38:55.460
MATT: "Here."

03:38:55.460 --> 03:38:58.600
And he produces what looks like
a folded pile of material

03:38:58.600 --> 03:39:01.330
and throws it
on the foot of your bed and goes,

03:39:01.330 --> 03:39:04.590
"Come, Vax, I made you a gift.

03:39:04.590 --> 03:39:08.030
"Put it on, come walk with me awhile.
We have a lot to talk about."

03:39:08.030 --> 03:39:10.000
LIAM: I open it up.

03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:15.000
MATT: It's a very well-crafted silk robe
of dark blue and black.

03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:17.890
Beaded, nice against the skin.
It's really, really nice.

03:39:17.890 --> 03:39:19.420
LIAM: (quietly) Give me a minute.

03:39:19.420 --> 03:39:21.500
(louder) There's a wooden screen
in the room.

03:39:21.500 --> 03:39:25.160
I go behind it
and wipe any oil left off my butt.

03:39:25.160 --> 03:39:27.640
(laughter)

03:39:27.640 --> 03:39:29.590
MATT: That's fantastic.

03:39:29.590 --> 03:39:33.380
LIAM: Everything looks all right.
And I put it on.

03:39:33.380 --> 03:39:37.030
MATT: All right. 
He waits for you patiently in the hallway.

03:39:39.036 --> 03:39:45.013
So he begins walking along.
Puts his arm out to you.

03:39:45.013 --> 03:39:46.220
LIAM: Take it.

03:39:46.220 --> 03:39:49.500
MATT: You take his arm.
You guys walk up along the hallway.

03:39:49.500 --> 03:39:53.350
He leads you to a staircase
that leads up further, and he goes,

03:39:56.700 --> 03:39:59.500
"I know a lot has happened
these recent months.

03:39:59.500 --> 03:40:01.680
"I've been watching from afar,

03:40:01.680 --> 03:40:06.000
"keeping tabs on your journey
best that I can.

03:40:06.000 --> 03:40:09.000
"But I still know so little."

03:40:09.000 --> 03:40:11.000
You ascend the lengthy staircase

03:40:11.000 --> 03:40:13.000
and you make your way
to the higher floor.

03:40:13.000 --> 03:40:15.000
You eventually open
an intricate door

03:40:15.000 --> 03:40:18.450
and walk out
onto a wide balcony on that tower

03:40:18.450 --> 03:40:22.000
that overlooks the grounds
and the castle before you.

03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:26.000
Beautiful moonlight, the night air.

03:40:26.000 --> 03:40:29.000
You see the moon is nearly full
and the white light illuminates

03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:33.000
the densely-forested countryside
surrounding the castle.

03:40:33.000 --> 03:40:34.500
He closes the door

03:40:34.500 --> 03:40:38.000
and walks up to you
at the edge of the balcony,

03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:41.140
looking over it all,
elbows on the edge.

03:40:43.820 --> 03:40:47.000
"Some time has passed, Vax.

03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:50.630
"And much of the world
moves on to newer, greater threats.

03:40:52.670 --> 03:40:55.430
"But true pain never really heals."

03:40:59.320 --> 03:41:02.020
He turns to you

03:41:02.020 --> 03:41:08.000
and steps up to you,
looking you close in the face.

03:41:08.000 --> 03:41:14.000
"You hurt me deeply.
And continue to hurt.

03:41:14.000 --> 03:41:20.350
"Agony, for weeks, months.

03:41:20.350 --> 03:41:24.260
"Pain I had never experienced.

03:41:24.260 --> 03:41:26.390
"(deepening to a growl)
It's all I can think about."

03:41:26.390 --> 03:41:28.000
LIAM: Can I make an insight check?

03:41:28.000 --> 03:41:31.000
MATT: You would, if you had time.

03:41:31.000 --> 03:41:34.690
MARISHA: Oh my god!
LAURA: (gasps) I knew it. I knew it.

03:41:34.690 --> 03:41:36.160
MARISHA: No!

03:41:38.710 --> 03:41:41.700
MATT: The pain hits you suddenly,
before anything else does,

03:41:41.700 --> 03:41:44.540
as you're lost in that face
and the sudden feeling,

03:41:44.540 --> 03:41:48.080
the sensation 
of terror and horror.

03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:56.050
You suffer 18 points

03:41:56.880 --> 03:41:58.930
of piercing damage,

03:42:01.000 --> 03:42:04.000
and I need you to make
a constitution saving throw.

03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:06.610
LIAM: Oh, that's my specialty.

03:42:08.650 --> 03:42:11.000
TALIESIN: (whispering) We don't know
what the hell this is.

03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:13.840
LIAM: Constitution save?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:42:13.840 --> 03:42:16.070
LIAM: 11.

03:42:16.070 --> 03:42:18.000
MATT: You feel the poison--

03:42:18.000 --> 03:42:20.640
LIAM: I'll use luck.
MATT: Roll again.

03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:24.500
LIAM: 18.

03:42:24.500 --> 03:42:28.000
MATT: You feel what should be
a pulse of poison hit your system

03:42:28.000 --> 03:42:31.340
and you manage to fight it off
as suddenly you look down

03:42:31.340 --> 03:42:36.000
and there is Gilmore
holding a blade thrust into your stomach,

03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:41.000
your robes now beginning to fill
with crimson red around the wound.

03:42:41.000 --> 03:42:46.890
It's at that moment you see him
pull you in and stare into your face

03:42:46.890 --> 03:42:49.350
with a very low growl,

03:42:49.350 --> 03:42:53.000
"It's all I think about."

03:42:53.000 --> 03:42:55.000
And you watch
as a flicker to his form happens

03:42:55.000 --> 03:42:58.000
and you see for a second
there's a flash: not skin, but fur.

03:42:58.000 --> 03:43:00.000
You see teeth, you see whiskers,

03:43:00.000 --> 03:43:03.410
and the hand holding the dagger
is facing the other direction.

03:43:05.000 --> 03:43:06.500
That's where
we're going to end tonight's session.

03:43:06.500 --> 03:43:08.500
(shocked exclamations)

03:43:08.500 --> 03:43:11.000
MARISHA: Nooo!

03:43:11.000 --> 03:43:13.000
LAURA: The rakshasa?
MARISHA: Is it a rakshasa?

03:43:13.000 --> 03:43:16.000
MATT: (laughs)
LAURA: Oh my god.

03:43:16.000 --> 03:43:18.000
TRAVIS: Ohhhh.

03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:21.000
MATT: We'll be back next week.

03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:22.500
LIAM: That fucked 
with my head, Matt.

03:43:22.500 --> 03:43:25.000
LIAM: What are you doing?
TALIESIN: Wow.

03:43:25.000 --> 03:43:26.700
MATT: What a rakshasa does.
SAM: Good job, man.

03:43:26.700 --> 03:43:28.500
LAURA: Oh my god.
MARISHA: What the fuck?!

03:43:28.500 --> 03:43:29.500
TALIESIN: Wow.

03:43:29.500 --> 03:43:31.500
MARISHA: Has he been a rakshasa 
the whole time?

03:43:31.500 --> 03:43:33.000
Wait, is it the rakshasa 
who's different?

03:43:33.000 --> 03:43:35.000
Is it not Gilmore? 
So many questions!

03:43:35.000 --> 03:43:38.000
LIAM AND MATT: (laugh)

03:43:38.000 --> 03:43:42.500
MATT: Perhaps this will be revealed
next week as we kick in

03:43:42.500 --> 03:43:44.000
at this very moment.

03:43:44.000 --> 03:43:45.500
LAURA: Oh my god.

03:43:45.500 --> 03:43:48.000
Why does it always leave off
when he's about to get killed?

03:43:48.000 --> 03:43:49.500
MARISHA: Right!
Why is it always you?

03:43:49.500 --> 03:43:51.630
SAM: Because he's always
almost about to die.

03:43:51.630 --> 03:43:53.000
LIAM: This one did die!

03:43:53.000 --> 03:43:54.500
TALIESIN: Because he runs
into all the rooms first

03:43:54.500 --> 03:43:56.000
and he makes out with everybody.

03:43:56.000 --> 03:43:58.000
LAURA: Because you do. That's the thing.
TALIESIN: That's why it happens.

03:43:58.000 --> 03:44:01.000
TALIESIN: He runs into the rooms first
and he puts his tongue exciting places.

03:44:01.000 --> 03:44:02.000
MARISHA AND LAURA: (laugh)

03:44:02.000 --> 03:44:03.500
MATT: You also happened
to lean in real close--

03:44:03.500 --> 03:44:05.000
TALIESIN: I'm not yelling at you, man.
I'm envious.

03:44:05.000 --> 03:44:06.500
MATT: And whisper in the ear
of the rakshasa

03:44:06.500 --> 03:44:08.000
as he slowly slit its throat
across the floor.

03:44:08.000 --> 03:44:10.000
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right,
you did do that.

03:44:10.000 --> 03:44:12.000
LAURA: Oh, so what did you do?
What did you do?

03:44:12.000 --> 03:44:13.500
LIAM: I slit its throat, yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

03:44:13.500 --> 03:44:15.000
LIAM: It's all right.
MARISHA: Hang on, wait.

03:44:15.000 --> 03:44:17.110
MATT: It just wants to come back
and show you the same love.

03:44:17.110 --> 03:44:18.570
MARISHA: Oh, wait,

03:44:18.570 --> 03:44:22.010
did you get the final blow
in the rakshasa in the Slayer's Take?

03:44:22.010 --> 03:44:23.500
LIAM: Yes, I did.
Yeah, I cut his throat.

03:44:23.500 --> 03:44:25.000
LAURA: And you said
something shitty to him.

03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:27.550
LIAM: He threatened my family
and I said,

03:44:27.550 --> 03:44:29.000
"Say something 
about my sister again,"

03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:30.500
and I slit his throat.

03:44:30.500 --> 03:44:32.000
LAURA: Oh, nice!
MATT: Oh, boy.

03:44:32.000 --> 03:44:33.570
TALIESIN: It's about to drop.

03:44:33.570 --> 03:44:38.060
MARISHA: But he was dead.
What the fuck is going on?!

03:44:38.060 --> 03:44:40.430
LAURA: Was he? Did you chop him up?

03:44:40.430 --> 03:44:43.620
MARISHA: No, because I'm not a psycho.

03:44:43.620 --> 03:44:45.000
SAM: This is exciting.

03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:47.000
MATT: This will be interesting
next week when we kick in.

03:44:47.000 --> 03:44:49.000
TALIESIN: There's a fine line
between psycho and practical.

03:44:49.010 --> 03:44:52.000
MARISHA: I can see
chopping someone's body up

03:44:52.000 --> 03:44:53.500
might be psycho.

03:44:53.500 --> 03:44:55.000
TALIESIN: It's not psycho

03:44:55.000 --> 03:44:57.000
if you drive a very small car
with not a lot of trunk space.

03:44:57.000 --> 03:44:58.000
TRAVIS: Nicely done, Matt.
LAURA: Nice, Matt.

03:44:58.000 --> 03:45:00.000
MATT: Guys, great game tonight.
LAURA: Thanks, guys.

03:45:00.000 --> 03:45:03.000
TRAVIS: That Raven Queen, whoo.
LIAM: Whoo.

03:45:03.000 --> 03:45:04.500
LAURA: That can be
the name of the episode:

03:45:04.500 --> 03:45:07.000
Yas Queen.

03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:09.000
(laughter)

03:45:09.000 --> 03:45:10.000
MATT: Awesome.

03:45:10.000 --> 03:45:12.000
Well, guys, we're going to go ahead
and get home and rest.

03:45:12.000 --> 03:45:13.500
Hope you enjoyed tonight's episode.

03:45:13.500 --> 03:45:16.000
TALIESIN: Is there going to be 
one more giveaway?

03:45:16.000 --> 03:45:17.000
MATT: Is there?

03:45:17.000 --> 03:45:18.500
LAURA: Are we doing another giveaway?

03:45:18.500 --> 03:45:20.520
LIAM: There were two Loot Crates, one--

03:45:20.520 --> 03:45:22.590
LUCAS: We'll do a giveaway 
afterwards.

03:45:22.590 --> 03:45:25.020
MATT: Okay, we'll do 
a giveaway afterwards. Perfect.

03:45:25.020 --> 03:45:27.620
One more DX Loot Crate box
coming your way.

03:45:27.620 --> 03:45:30.000
LAURA: Thanks, Loot Crate!

03:45:30.000 --> 03:45:32.000
LIAM: Thanks, Joe Madureira,
for the art!

03:45:32.000 --> 03:45:34.000
LAURA: Thanks, Joe!
ASHLEY: Get your posters!

03:45:34.000 --> 03:45:35.500
TALIESIN: It's so cool.

03:45:35.500 --> 03:45:38.000
LAURA: Thanks, Critters, 
for being awesome!

03:45:38.000 --> 03:45:40.000
MATT: Hope you guys got to enjoy

03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:43.000
our silly E3 couple hours
we did earlier on GameSpot.

03:45:43.000 --> 03:45:45.000
I'm sure that'll go up soon, anyway.

03:45:45.000 --> 03:45:48.000
But anyway, guys,
we'll see you next week.

03:45:48.000 --> 03:45:52.000
Until then, rest well and,
is it Thursday yet? See you then.
