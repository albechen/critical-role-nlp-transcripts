00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.625
MATT: Hello, and good evening, everyone! Welcome
to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass

00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:10.945
voice actors play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons! Or yell
curse words at me as we intro. So yes! Welcome to

00:00:10.945 --> 00:00:17.666
the show tonight! Sam Riegel is on his way, our
Scanlan will be here shortly. Such is the nature

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:23.827
of these things. But, anyway, welcome to our show,
friends new and old. Tonight, we're continuing a

00:00:23.827 --> 00:00:28.576
rather intense beginning of the next arc of
Critical Role, as Laura prepares her dice via

00:00:28.576 --> 00:00:34.714
bulk-rolling. I like the juju aspect of it. It's
nice. It gets the energy going. Just burn all

00:00:34.714 --> 00:00:36.315
those twenties out first.

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:37.761
LAURA: Oh, I've already rolled two.

00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:39.014
MATT: See? There you go.

00:00:39.014 --> 00:00:40.215
LIAM: Those are two you cannot use.

00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:41.448
LAURA: I know!

00:00:41.448 --> 00:00:47.017
MATT: So, yeah! So, tonight we have a special
guest that will be coming into the show a little

00:00:47.017 --> 00:00:52.174
later on, as part of the story arc, and after
tonight, we will be having Critmas for this month.

00:00:52.174 --> 00:00:56.084
It won't be all of us, some folks have a really
early morning tomorrow and unfortunately have to

00:00:56.084 --> 00:01:03.015
run off due to needing to exist tomorrow
professionally, but we will be doing that this

00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:05.792
evening. Let's see, as far as announcements go--

00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:09.011
MARISHA: We're winging it today. Sorry.

00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:13.361
MATT: Yeah. It's all good. So, I guess first and
foremost, reminder for those of us who are

00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:19.815
interested in going to Portland for Wizard World
Portland in a few weeks, we'll be there for that.

00:01:19.815 --> 00:01:21.648
I know, except for Liam.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:25.026
TRAVIS: February 19th to the 21st. Come say hi!
Yeah.

00:01:25.026 --> 00:01:27.590
MARISHA: It's so hard to get all of us in one
place at the same time.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.441
TRAVIS: If you're even in a neighboring state,
come see us, because we might not make it all that

00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:33.516
way again.

00:01:33.516 --> 00:01:35.797
LAURA: And bring your dice, and we'll all roll
together!

00:01:35.797 --> 00:01:38.510
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll bless them. Or he will.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.036
TALIESIN: I'll bless them, Laura will curse them,
it'll be great!

00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:49.243
MATT: Also, me and Marisha will be at Colorado
Anime Fest, the weekend before that-- actually

00:01:49.243 --> 00:01:50.324
next weekend.

00:01:50.324 --> 00:01:51.665
MARISHA: Valentine's-- next weekend!

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:53.061
MATT: Next weekend! We'll be in Denver for that
convention.

00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:54.570
MARISHA: Come spend Valentine's Day with us.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.440
TALIESIN: And I will be at Amazing Arizona Comic
Con that weekend. The Amazing Arizona Comic Con,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.852
Saturday and Sunday.

00:02:00.852 --> 00:02:03.634
LIAM: Sam's here-- can someone let Sam in?

00:02:03.634 --> 00:02:04.755
LAURA: We have a gnome!

00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:05.835
MATT: Let Sam in!

00:02:05.835 --> 00:02:07.138
TRAVIS: (yelling) I got him!

00:02:07.138 --> 00:02:18.667
MATT: Travis has this. I like this very much.
Let's see, other announcements. Oh, the next

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:23.616
episode of the GM/DM Tips goes up tomorrow on the
Geek &amp;amp; Sundry website. Check that out. Not sure

00:02:23.616 --> 00:02:26.690
what topic it is. I don't know what order they're
putting them out on, so it'll be a surprise for

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.315
both of us! But hopefully you guys will find it
helpful. I hope the previous ones have as well. If

00:02:31.315 --> 00:02:35.060
these turn out well, and people like them, and go
click on them and share them around, they'll be

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.201
more apt to do more, in which case I can do more
in-depth, advanced videos. So, let's hope that

00:02:41.201 --> 00:02:42.687
works out well.

00:02:42.687 --> 00:02:47.817
MARISHA: Even if you're not a DM, you should go
look at them. So you can keep making more!

00:02:47.817 --> 00:02:49.184
MATT: Exactly. Yes!

00:02:49.184 --> 00:02:51.271
MARISHA: Be a kind clicker.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:54.427
(Last of Us clicker noises)

00:02:54.427 --> 00:03:00.047
MATT: Yeah, that's a whole different clicker. And
then, first weekend of March, me and Marisha will

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:05.602
be in Cork, in Ireland, for Kaizoku Con. So,
that'll be a lot of fun, you guys can come out

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:10.089
there. And yes, I know that Ireland is not in the
UK, that was meant to be a joke, but the internet

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:14.172
did not take it as such, and felt the need to
correct me for a week. And you know what, I

00:03:14.172 --> 00:03:15.174
deserve that--

00:03:15.174 --> 00:03:16.472
LIAM: There are no jokes here!

00:03:16.472 --> 00:03:19.485
TALIESIN: That's crazy, the internet has the best
sense of humor about everything!

00:03:19.485 --> 00:03:21.810
MARISHA: The internet always understands sarcasm!

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.884
MATT: But as a person of some Irish lineage, I may
have accidentally also offended my ancestors, so I

00:03:26.884 --> 00:03:28.529
apologize to everyone!

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:30.597
ALL: Hey!

00:03:30.597 --> 00:03:32.519
MATT: We have a gnome!

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.222
MARISHA: Hey scarf man!

00:03:34.222 --> 00:03:37.184
SAM: I got to go get ice!

00:03:37.184 --> 00:03:39.555
MATT: Go get ice? He'll be back!

00:03:39.555 --> 00:03:42.079
LIAM: Is he cosplaying as Matthew Mercer? What's
going on?

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.521
MARISHA: Thanks to the Critter who sent us bacon
jerky.

00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:50.127
LAURA: Travis will be smelling like bacon jerky
for the rest of his life.

00:03:50.127 --> 00:03:56.807
TRAVIS: Prepare yourself! That smells extra like
dog farts!

00:03:56.807 --> 00:04:01.172
LAURA: Oh! It really does!

00:04:01.172 --> 00:04:03.377
TRAVIS: Just have a piece! One little piece!

00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:05.653
LAURA: I'm sure it's delicious!

00:04:05.653 --> 00:04:07.101
TRAVIS: I'll give you the ear.

00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:08.802
TALIESIN: Thank you!

00:04:08.802 --> 00:04:10.880
MATT: Aww, that's-- whoever sent those, thank
you.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.047
MARISHA: That was amazing!

00:04:12.047 --> 00:04:14.703
TALIESIN: That's very aerodynamic jerky.

00:04:14.703 --> 00:04:18.202
MATT: Let's see, other announcements. Liam, do you
want to mention that one thing?

00:04:18.202 --> 00:04:23.801
LIAM: Yeah, we'll do our weekly shout-out to
Wyrmwood gaming. If you go over to Wyrmwood Gaming

00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:29.093
and put in the code "CRITROLE", you'll get free
shipping, and also, over at Wyrmwood Gaming,

00:04:29.093 --> 00:04:36.596
they're doing a Valentine's Day Lottery, where
you're getting a mystery box for a lower rate? I

00:04:36.596 --> 00:04:40.411
dunno, look at the rules, I don't want to mess it
up. But your dork dollars will go farther if you

00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:43.394
go over there this week. Happy Valentine's Day!

00:04:43.394 --> 00:04:46.485
TRAVIS: Dork dollars, that's like bitcoin, right?

00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:53.001
MATT: Yeah, kind of! Let's see, other things-- for
those who didn't see it, Lootcrate put up a

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:59.492
cool video about their most recent package that's
going out this month, themed "Dead," in which they

00:04:59.492 --> 00:05:03.444
shot a ten-minute short film in the zombie
apocalypse, starring me!

00:05:03.444 --> 00:05:04.431
LAURA: I saw!

00:05:04.431 --> 00:05:09.119
MATT: Did you see it? It was fun. I got really
dirty. And Marisha has a cameo in it as my

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:10.846
deceased girlfriend.

00:05:10.846 --> 00:05:12.606
Sorry.

00:05:12.606 --> 00:05:13.974
LIAM: So sad.

00:05:13.974 --> 00:05:15.898
TRAVIS: You didn't save her?

00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:19.108
MATT: Look! You think I can save anyone in the
apocalypse?

00:05:19.108 --> 00:05:20.471
TRAVIS: I would hope so.

00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:25.640
MARISHA: Honestly, it's impressive that you were
the one that lived.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.224
TRAVIS: Would you straight-up run, or would you
throw people in front of you so that they would be

00:05:28.224 --> 00:05:29.064
trampled?

00:05:29.064 --> 00:05:32.015
MATT: Neither! I'd try and work things out, and
then get sniped in the head. We've had this

00:05:32.015 --> 00:05:32.986
conversation.

00:05:32.986 --> 00:05:35.660
MARISHA: Yeah, are you kidding me? He'd be the
first one that would be like, "Oh, rivalling--"

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.912
LAURA: "Let's save everyone!"

00:05:36.912 --> 00:05:39.169
SAM: Phone's ringing, sorry.

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:40.712
MATT: Oh. You need to get that.

00:05:40.712 --> 00:05:43.096
SAM: You know what, I'll send it to voicemail.

00:05:43.096 --> 00:05:47.061
MATT: Oh, thank you, Sam! So conscientious.
(laughs)

00:05:47.061 --> 00:05:52.610
All righty, anything else anyone needs to
mention? Or announce?

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.226
TRAVIS: Bacon jerky's fucking good!

00:05:55.226 --> 00:06:04.008
LAURA: It actually is really good. Yeah, once
you've tasted it, you don't smell the stank.

00:06:04.008 --> 00:06:06.744
TALIESIN: It's like garlic. As long as everybody's
had the garlic, everything's cool.

00:06:06.744 --> 00:06:08.511
LAURA: You wanna try it?

00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:09.834
LIAM: No, I can smell it on you now!

00:06:09.834 --> 00:06:11.013
LAURA: Right? It's disgusting!

00:06:11.013 --> 00:06:12.177
TRAVIS: You want some? You want to join the fold?

00:06:12.177 --> 00:06:13.263
LIAM: No!

00:06:13.263 --> 00:06:19.326
MARISHA: It is adding to, like, the tavern-ish
feel of this place.

00:06:19.326 --> 00:06:23.602
MATT: All righty! Announcements are over-- let's
go ahead and get into the game proper.

00:06:23.602 --> 00:06:26.611
LAURA: Oh no!

00:06:26.611 --> 00:06:32.406
MATT: So, to get us up to speed. Vox Machina, the
intrepid band of adventurers, who have been

00:06:32.406 --> 00:06:39.185
enjoying being honorary members of the council of
Tal'Dorei, returning from a harsh adventure in

00:06:39.185 --> 00:06:47.408
Whitestone, having the Winter's Crest festival,
and then going in and re-inspecting the death

00:06:47.408 --> 00:06:53.737
place of a blue dragon they once fought over a
year ago, returned just in time for a series of

00:06:53.737 --> 00:07:02.515
chromatic dragons, white, black, red, and green,
all attacking Emon at once. This union of

00:07:02.515 --> 00:07:09.428
extremely powerful dragons tore through the city,
with the red staying behind, named Thordak, the

00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:16.691
Cinder King, basically housing himself in Emon and
claiming himself essentially ruler of that area.

00:07:16.691 --> 00:07:24.723
The party fled to their keep, attempted to help a
bunch of refugees inside and then were immediately

00:07:24.723 --> 00:07:29.696
attacked by Vorugal, the white dragon. A heavy
battle commenced that was ill in favor of your

00:07:29.696 --> 00:07:35.764
victory until Thordak himself knocked Vorugal out
of the sky, claiming that there were better things

00:07:35.764 --> 00:07:43.435
to be done. So three of the four of this Chroma
Conclave have now gone east, while Thordak sits in

00:07:43.435 --> 00:07:50.429
the middle of his new nesting place. You guys
decided to try and help those who were in the keep

00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:57.166
at the time, those who survived that encounter on
the outside of Greyskull. However, Percy and Grog

00:07:57.166 --> 00:08:01.732
had a conversation about this magical skull
artifact they had acquired: this whispering in

00:08:01.732 --> 00:08:10.190
exchange for a wish if it got freed. This led to a
rather intense bit of conflict--

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.384
TRAVIS: Negotiation?

00:08:11.384 --> 00:08:19.335
MATT: Yes. (laughs) Which, thanks to the luck of
the die, seemed to avoid a unique circumstance,

00:08:19.335 --> 00:08:20.822
whatever that might have been.

00:08:20.822 --> 00:08:22.718
TRAVIS: Bullshit.

00:08:22.718 --> 00:08:30.111
MATT: (laughs) However, the party in this tense
scenario were then visited by a dwarven

00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:39.823
elementalist named Drake, along with your old-time
friend and guide Allura Vysoren, who had sensed

00:08:39.823 --> 00:08:46.255
the connection to her teleportation circles here
in Emon severed immediately. There was discussion

00:08:46.255 --> 00:08:51.577
about how this came about, who's to blame, and it
appears that this dragon has a history, 15 years

00:08:51.577 --> 00:08:56.633
before, of having conflict with Allura and her
then-party of adventurers, many of whom lost their

00:08:56.633 --> 00:09:01.471
life in the final battle. When they realized they
were unable to actually defeat Thordak, hatched a

00:09:01.471 --> 00:09:05.666
plan to seal him within the elemental plane of
fire, and had managed to keep him there for 15

00:09:05.666 --> 00:09:14.166
years until recently. We left off with Allura
suddenly sensing her connection to the Westruun

00:09:14.166 --> 00:09:17.069
sigil severed as well.

00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:18.916
LAURA: God, I forgot about that!

00:09:18.916 --> 00:09:21.385
TRAVIS: Nothing like genocide to put you in the
mood!

00:09:21.385 --> 00:09:31.378
MATT: Yeah! That is where we'll pick up. So, at
this point, after Allura senses this, her eyes go

00:09:31.378 --> 00:09:36.248
wide for a moment and she-- you, being there in
front of her still, Keyleth, after your guys'

00:09:36.248 --> 00:09:43.105
scrying ritual, grabs your shoulder, and looks
around the room. "Who is left? Where is the

00:09:43.105 --> 00:09:48.243
"council? Which allies can we draw to us, in hopes
of planning our next move?"

00:09:48.243 --> 00:09:51.179
MARISHA: We don't know.

00:09:51.179 --> 00:09:52.737
TRAVIS: We are scattered.

00:09:52.737 --> 00:09:54.600
LAURA: For all we know, the council is lost.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.076
MARISHA: We could be all that's left.

00:09:56.076 --> 00:10:05.997
MATT: (sighs) "Well, we have to try and gather
what information we can about who remains. If

00:10:05.997 --> 00:10:10.454
"anyone out there survives, any of our allies, we
need to make sure that they're brought away from

00:10:10.454 --> 00:10:19.753
"the center of this chaos. And hopefully we can
reconvene and figure out a path of hoping to free

00:10:19.753 --> 00:10:24.678
"our city, our entire land, of this scourge."

00:10:24.678 --> 00:10:30.415
LAURA: How do we even make contact with them?
Thordak is in the center of town.

00:10:30.415 --> 00:10:37.793
MATT: "Perhaps skirting the center and hoping
others have found their way towards the outskirts

00:10:37.793 --> 00:10:45.107
"of it. I don't know. This is as far as I've gotten
to the city, is your guys' keep. You have the

00:10:45.107 --> 00:10:50.848
"better position on this. Where would anyone in the
town go? Are there places to hide, are there--"

00:10:50.848 --> 00:10:57.870
LIAM: I think that they would leave the center of
the city, at least to the edges, if not try to get

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:01.264
out, though that might be foolish.

00:11:01.264 --> 00:11:03.859
TALIESIN: Check the harbor, maybe?

00:11:03.859 --> 00:11:08.730
LAURA: We know that Riskel made secret passageways
in different places.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.474
TRAVIS: Security tunnels!

00:11:10.474 --> 00:11:17.514
LAURA: Yeah. Did we ever find out if he put one in
ours? Did we have one? That leads into the town?

00:11:17.514 --> 00:11:19.021
TALIESIN: We don't know.

00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:23.070
SAM: Oh, didn't we have a tunnel made that goes
under the wall?

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.423
MATT: You did, actually.

00:11:25.423 --> 00:11:28.408
MARISHA: But does it lead out into the city?

00:11:28.408 --> 00:11:30.415
MATT: You haven't actually utilized it yet.

00:11:30.415 --> 00:11:34.914
LIAM: We've never used it, but they described it
to us when they brought us here the first day.

00:11:34.914 --> 00:11:36.803
LAURA: Maybe we can sneak in!

00:11:36.803 --> 00:11:38.039
SAM: To the city.

00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:39.055
LAURA: Well, yeah!

00:11:39.055 --> 00:11:41.206
LIAM: We need to see if Uriel is still alive.

00:11:41.206 --> 00:11:42.485
SAM: By the way, hi guys.

00:11:42.485 --> 00:11:43.581
LAURA: Hi, how's it going?

00:11:43.581 --> 00:11:46.637
TRAVIS: Wait, who was with Gilmore?

00:11:46.637 --> 00:11:48.895
LAURA: Gilmore disappeared. I didn't see where he
went.

00:11:48.895 --> 00:11:50.881
LIAM: He was alone before it all happened.

00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:53.648
TALIESIN: Well, that's another place to check.

00:11:53.648 --> 00:11:55.950
MARISHA: What, where? Gilmore's?

00:11:55.950 --> 00:12:00.751
TALIESIN: I'm thinking of where I would go if I
didn't know what to do--

00:12:00.751 --> 00:12:01.891
LIAM: That's smart.

00:12:01.891 --> 00:12:04.248
LAURA: What places are left that have a
teleportation circle?

00:12:04.248 --> 00:12:08.922
SAM: What about the thieves' guild tunnels? Would
anyone go there?

00:12:08.922 --> 00:12:13.802
MARISHA: It depends on who knows! It's a way out
of the city once again.

00:12:13.802 --> 00:12:15.369
LAURA: The smuggler's coves, all of them.

00:12:15.369 --> 00:12:16.781
TALIESIN: That's not a bad idea, either.

00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:18.380
MARISHA: That was all through the--

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.294
SAM: That bar.

00:12:19.294 --> 00:12:21.237
MARISHA: Through the bar, in the--

00:12:21.237 --> 00:12:23.201
SAM: Place. With the thing.

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:25.922
LAURA: That one!

00:12:25.922 --> 00:12:34.056
MATT: "The connections I had to this town were
within my tower, your keep, and the Lyceum, the

00:12:34.056 --> 00:12:39.507
"Alabaster Lyceum. The Lyceum has also been
severed, and though I know not of what may remain

00:12:39.507 --> 00:12:45.288
"there, that is also a place of great power, hence
why it was probably a very operative target for

00:12:45.288 --> 00:12:46.628
"their attack."

00:12:46.628 --> 00:12:47.676
MARISHA: Allura.

00:12:47.676 --> 00:12:48.537
MATT: "Yes?"

00:12:48.537 --> 00:12:54.143
MARISHA: How far does your arcane connection
reach? Can you feel when you lose connection to

00:12:54.143 --> 00:12:55.401
other cities?

00:12:55.401 --> 00:13:03.739
MATT: "If I have a connection to the sigil, yes. I
don't have much beyond the boundaries of

00:13:03.739 --> 00:13:12.086
"Tal'Dorei. Vasselheim does not allow sigils for
transportation, it's against their philosophy

00:13:12.086 --> 00:13:22.784
"against embedded arcane intrusion. If Westruun is
under attack as well, I will make my way there in

00:13:22.784 --> 00:13:25.127
"hopes of salvaging any lives that I can."

00:13:25.127 --> 00:13:27.300
MARISHA: You're leaving?

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:36.425
LAURA: If Westruun is under attack, now, and we
know Thordak is here, does that mean--?

00:13:36.425 --> 00:13:38.288
TRAVIS: His forces are divided.

00:13:38.288 --> 00:13:43.488
MARISHA: This is a takeover. For some reason
Thordak doesn't want to leave this city. Why?

00:13:43.488 --> 00:13:46.398
SAM: This is the seat of power, right?

00:13:46.398 --> 00:13:50.304
LAURA: We could potentially attack one of his
subordinates, though. One of the other dragons in

00:13:50.304 --> 00:13:52.200
Westruun, by themselves!

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.447
SAM: But then he could just come and kill us!

00:13:56.447 --> 00:13:58.501
LAURA: Well, then we teleport right back out.

00:13:58.501 --> 00:13:59.626
SAM: Okay?

00:13:59.626 --> 00:14:04.199
LAURA: Bad idea? Bad idea?

00:14:04.199 --> 00:14:05.854
SAM: How fast is he?

00:14:05.854 --> 00:14:13.154
MARISHA: Well, they just made it to Westruun,
several hundred miles away, in all of 40 minutes?

00:14:13.154 --> 00:14:14.950
TALIESIN: There's a lot of assumptions here.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:20.883
MATT: "They move rather fast, and to be honest, I
hate to inform you, but my single teleportation

00:14:20.883 --> 00:14:25.297
"ability has been utilized for the day in getting
here."

00:14:25.297 --> 00:14:26.255
LAURA: Oh.

00:14:26.255 --> 00:14:28.119
MARISHA: I'm tapped out, too.

00:14:28.119 --> 00:14:29.993
TRAVIS: Me too.

00:14:29.993 --> 00:14:34.306
LIAM: Lady Allura, what do you know of Marquet?

00:14:34.306 --> 00:14:36.647
MATT: "Marquet."

00:14:36.647 --> 00:14:40.152
LIAM: You said that they successfully repulsed
him.

00:14:40.152 --> 00:14:45.403
MATT: "400 years ago, yes, when he was younger. He
was a much smaller dragon then."

00:14:45.403 --> 00:14:46.801
LIAM: Oh.

00:14:46.801 --> 00:14:48.867
TRAVIS: 400 years ago?

00:14:48.867 --> 00:14:51.613
LAURA: Yeah, he is ancient, Grog! He is ancient!

00:14:51.613 --> 00:14:53.628
TRAVIS: Yeah, slightly.

00:14:53.628 --> 00:15:02.723
MATT: "The only thing I can think of: there are
two bastions of knowledge that hold inklings as to

00:15:02.723 --> 00:15:07.472
"what could be the undoing of dragonkind, of
powerful entities. There were battles of many such

00:15:07.472 --> 00:15:18.482
"powerful entities, long, long ago, back before the
Penance, before the historical wiping of

00:15:18.482 --> 00:15:25.238
"civilization. Some of these books remain in
Vasselheim, being the only city to have survived

00:15:25.238 --> 00:15:35.212
"those times. A few have found their way in the
Cobalt Reserve, the library of Westruun. If I

00:15:35.212 --> 00:15:40.939
"could go and hope that this library still stands,
stay out of sight, help who I can along the way,

00:15:40.939 --> 00:15:45.945
"and gather what bits of research I can and bring
them back here, perhaps we could reconvene as long

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:50.400
"as you go and find who you can of our allies that
survive within Emon."

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.252
LAURA: We can do that!

00:15:52.252 --> 00:15:53.392
TRAVIS: Within Emon.

00:15:53.392 --> 00:15:54.387
LAURA: Yes.

00:15:54.387 --> 00:15:56.131
SAM: Going to let you go on your own?

00:15:56.131 --> 00:15:58.394
LIAM: Well, she has Drake with her.

00:15:58.394 --> 00:16:04.241
MATT: Which Drake next to her says, "Damn right,
she does! And I don't mean any offence, but the

00:16:04.241 --> 00:16:06.699
"two of us is about the same as you lot!"

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:08.145
TRAVIS: Say what?

00:16:08.145 --> 00:16:14.797
MATT: "Trust me," and he gives you this dwarven
grin as both of his eyes spark for a second with

00:16:14.797 --> 00:16:15.888
electricity.

00:16:15.888 --> 00:16:17.445
TRAVIS: (quietly) Well, fuck.

00:16:17.445 --> 00:16:23.866
MATT: She pushes him aside and goes, "It's all
right, Drake. For our mission, it's going to

00:16:23.924 --> 00:16:34.190
"require more-- success is guided on being subtle.
Some of you excel at that, maybe not all. And

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:39.494
"speed. I believe we can handle this. You're better
suited in combing large bits of territory and

00:16:39.494 --> 00:16:41.296
"seeking the allies that may survive."

00:16:41.296 --> 00:16:43.833
LAURA: Will you be leaving in the morning, then?
Can you go tonight?

00:16:43.833 --> 00:16:45.131
MATT: "I should leave now."

00:16:45.131 --> 00:16:46.789
MARISHA: You're going to go on foot?

00:16:46.789 --> 00:16:49.136
MATT: "We have other means of transportation."

00:16:49.136 --> 00:16:56.115
MARISHA: Allura, if you're going to Westruun, and
what you say is true, that we have two potential

00:16:56.115 --> 00:17:03.435
options for finding out how to defeat these
dragons, should we be heading to Vasselheim? Maybe

00:17:03.435 --> 00:17:05.865
that's best where we're needed right now.

00:17:05.865 --> 00:17:13.916
MATT: "If Vasselheim still stands, I-- knowing its
history, that is one of the most fortified cities,

00:17:13.916 --> 00:17:23.269
"the most fortified city in our civilization. It's
endured two great wars, and has been the starting

00:17:23.269 --> 00:17:29.839
"point of each cycle. I doubt even with the might
that these dragons hold, they would have the gall,

00:17:29.839 --> 00:17:37.363
"the foolish intent, to attack such a place.
Especially the center of an entity such as

00:17:37.363 --> 00:17:43.519
"Bahamut, who stands against such creatures. I
think Vasselheim is going to definitely claim a

00:17:43.519 --> 00:17:49.424
"key role in this attempt to save ourselves."

00:17:49.424 --> 00:17:52.062
LAURA: Bahamut is a good guy?

00:17:52.062 --> 00:17:54.570
MARISHA: Yeah, for the most-- yeah, yeah.

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:55.713
LAURA: Cool.

00:17:55.713 --> 00:18:01.841
MARISHA: It's the city that was closest to Pyrah.

00:18:01.841 --> 00:18:03.891
MATT: "Yes."

00:18:03.891 --> 00:18:15.612
MARISHA: My people, my tribe. We could pull double
duty, we could go and I can--

00:18:15.612 --> 00:18:17.328
TRAVIS: Heh. Doody.

00:18:17.328 --> 00:18:19.215
MARISHA: Grog! Now is not the time!

00:18:19.215 --> 00:18:25.585
TALIESIN: What of Whitestone? Was there any
mention, any--?

00:18:25.585 --> 00:18:32.261
MATT: "I have no connection to Whitestone. I did
not have time arriving there to install a sigil."

00:18:32.261 --> 00:18:38.391
TALIESIN: Did you learn anything of the anomaly
beneath the castle that might be useful?

00:18:38.391 --> 00:18:50.180
MATT: She shakes herself in her current mindset
and goes, "Well, me and Drake here, we spent the

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:55.668
"better part of two days studying the structure
underneath the city. It itself appears to be at

00:18:55.668 --> 00:19:02.308
"least 600 years old, predating Whitestone's
construction. Unfortunately, both of our magics

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:08.564
"are thwarted in the proximity of this structure
and any rituals that we attempted, or would have

00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:16.095
"been able to attempt, to discern its nature, in
the classic means, would not be functional due to

00:19:16.095 --> 00:19:23.458
"its anti-magical properties. However, we've taken
a few things of note, and we're taking our

00:19:23.458 --> 00:19:27.744
"observations to reach for two research facilities
around the world, one of which I intended to be

00:19:27.744 --> 00:19:30.982
"the Cobalt Reserve before this happened."

00:19:30.982 --> 00:19:34.815
TALIESIN: Interesting, thank you.

00:19:34.815 --> 00:19:39.507
LAURA: So there was no-- you didn't move it, you
didn't do anything with it, it's still just

00:19:39.507 --> 00:19:40.577
sitting there.

00:19:40.577 --> 00:19:41.897
MARISHA: It's a hazard zone right now?

00:19:41.897 --> 00:19:46.174
MATT: "Essentially. We have locked it off and it's
under intense guard. We spent a little bit of

00:19:46.174 --> 00:19:52.732
"time experimenting with its properties, and any
object of firm matter that was introduced to this

00:19:52.732 --> 00:19:58.503
"object was then torn from our grasp, sundered
into many pieces, and then vanished."

00:19:58.503 --> 00:20:00.970
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.577
LAURA: Maybe we can get Thordak near the little
orb!

00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:03.586
SAM: Yeah, yeah! Yeah!

00:20:03.586 --> 00:20:04.870
LAURA: I like it.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.116
TALIESIN: That was definitely what I was
thinking.

00:20:06.116 --> 00:20:07.431
SAM: How do we do that?

00:20:07.431 --> 00:20:09.380
TALIESIN: Well, it's part of a plan.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:13.999
TRAVIS: Hey, big dragon, there's a snack over
here. Take a bite!

00:20:13.999 --> 00:20:19.382
SAM: We could leave a trail of gold that leads to
it, Goldilocks-style.

00:20:19.382 --> 00:20:28.195
MARISHA: That thing was also several hundred feet
below ground. How are we going to get that dragon

00:20:28.195 --> 00:20:29.238
down there?

00:20:29.238 --> 00:20:31.112
LIAM: Does Thordak have any offspring?

00:20:31.112 --> 00:20:32.275
MATT: "Not that I know of."

00:20:32.275 --> 00:20:35.370
LAURA: Not anymore.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.376
TALIESIN: The thought would be to actually remove
it from the chamber, maybe.

00:20:39.376 --> 00:20:43.138
LAURA: That could be really, really terrible.

00:20:43.138 --> 00:20:48.477
TRAVIS: Do dragons have families? Do they have,
like, wives and loved ones?

00:20:48.477 --> 00:20:49.939
LAURA: They have children.

00:20:49.939 --> 00:20:57.350
MATT "Chromatics especially, from what I
understand in my research, they do mate, but there

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:02.085
"is no family structure, there is no love between
brethren, other than the continued existence of

slaughtered and one does find out, depending on if

00:21:10.738 --> 00:21:17.950

of vengeance, depending on the color. But I know

"of no immediate children to Thordak. I have no
knowledge of the other dragons which have attacked

00:21:29.984 --> 00:21:31.496
TRAVIS: We should ask him.

00:21:31.496 --> 00:21:35.269
LAURA: (laughs) We need to do as much research as
we can.

00:21:35.269 --> 00:21:39.491
MATT "I have not seen Thordak myself in 15 years,
and I know not the state of which he is in, or

00:21:39.491 --> 00:21:46.336
"what power he has now gained. Whatever information
you can gather safely, right now, is going to

"guide us down the rest of this path in attempting
to take this terrible creature down."

00:21:51.998 --> 00:22:00.334
SAM: If we go back into the city to try to find
council members, and we succeed, what does that

00:22:00.334 --> 00:22:05.660
get us? A bunch of people who also don't know how
to defeat the dragon.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:09.300
LAURA: Right, but they're powerful people! They
could help us.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.782
SAM: Politically?

00:22:10.782 --> 00:22:12.546
TALIESIN: Both, actually.

00:22:12.546 --> 00:22:14.242
LAURA: Experience and warrior-wise.

00:22:14.242 --> 00:22:19.987
TRAVIS: What about a spy? Dragons want servitude,
right?

00:22:19.987 --> 00:22:27.715
MATT: "They, especially the reds, see themselves
as superior to all beings, and will bend, and have

00:22:27.715 --> 00:22:33.516
"in the past bent, small townships and
civilizations to their whims and worship, yes.

00:22:33.516 --> 00:22:38.253
"Which is, based on what you're telling me, is part
of what Thordak is attempting with this city now."

00:22:38.253 --> 00:22:44.278
TRAVIS: So, what if we send a shady piece of shit
to go bend the knee and walk on the inside?

00:22:44.278 --> 00:22:48.130
SAM: Listen, Jarett is good, but I don't want to
sacrifice him like that!

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:53.787
LAURA: What about you, Scanlan? You're so good at
lying, and--

00:22:53.787 --> 00:22:55.181
MARISHA: Being shady!

00:22:55.181 --> 00:22:57.842
LAURA: And sucking up, and grovelling--

00:22:57.842 --> 00:23:00.114
SAM: What about Trinket?

00:23:00.114 --> 00:23:02.074
LAURA: Trinket can't talk!

00:23:02.074 --> 00:23:03.269
SAM: Oh, that's right!

00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:04.767
MARISHA: That's not a bad idea.

00:23:04.767 --> 00:23:11.225
LIAM: And I do have this-- pulling the brooch
off-- this would mask your true nature, somewhat.

00:23:11.225 --> 00:23:14.702
TRAVIS: It's true! (gasps)

00:23:14.702 --> 00:23:17.641
SAM: (stuttering) I am not going to go--

00:23:17.641 --> 00:23:20.419
TRAVIS: Ancient, giant, red, fuck-off dragon!

00:23:20.419 --> 00:23:27.207
SAM: They have mind control powers! They have
influence! They have charisma! Beyond even mine!

00:23:27.207 --> 00:23:32.794
TRAVIS: You'll be his bitch! You'll trim his
toenails, you'll get real buddy-buddy--

00:23:32.794 --> 00:23:34.604
SAM: I'm the size of his toenails!

00:23:34.604 --> 00:23:36.571
LAURA: Slave Leia outfit, with a chain around your
neck!

00:23:36.571 --> 00:23:40.055
LIAM: No, he's the little guy next to Jabba!
(cackling laughter)

00:23:40.055 --> 00:23:43.495
MARISHA: You might be surprised. You might like
it!

00:23:43.495 --> 00:23:46.793
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean like what, dragons have to
eat right? Dragons eat?

00:23:46.793 --> 00:23:48.379
LAURA: Dragons eat.

00:23:48.379 --> 00:23:55.508
TRAVIS: Yeah! So you poison a cow, and then
you're like, Oh Lord Thioredoxin, here you go!

00:23:55.508 --> 00:23:59.501
Poison cow, you're dead, hero of the city!

00:23:59.501 --> 00:24:02.205
SAM: Something tells me I would end up his gimp.

00:24:02.205 --> 00:24:07.012
TRAVIS: (stuttering) You Dimension Door! You're
super quick! It's a no brainer!

00:24:07.012 --> 00:24:10.228
SAM: All right, that's the best plan ever.

00:24:10.228 --> 00:24:12.759
LAURA: Let's just think about it, all right,
Scanlan?

00:24:12.759 --> 00:24:18.142
LIAM: We need to find Uriel. We need to go in--
all these are the next step-- we need to see-- we

00:24:18.142 --> 00:24:22.773
have sacrificed a lot to save Uriel before, we're
not just going to leave him in the city! We need to

00:24:22.773 --> 00:24:27.587
find the tunnel under this keep, go in there, see
who's left, and get them out!

00:24:27.587 --> 00:24:35.284
MARISHA: You know, speaking of spies, does anyone
else feel like this is fairly convenient timing?

00:24:35.284 --> 00:24:46.780
Someone in that council had to have known this was
happening. Wouldn't you? All of the Cloudtop

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.831
District was in one place!

00:24:48.831 --> 00:24:50.870
LIAM: That's not a bad point.

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:56.288
MARISHA: Someone knew! It was the perfect
opportunity to strike! They took out the entire

00:24:56.288 --> 00:25:00.355
upper echelon of the city in one strike! They
waited for them all to be in one place.

00:25:00.355 --> 00:25:05.195
LAURA: General Krieg was here for a while, before
we discovered him. He had friends.

00:25:05.195 --> 00:25:07.235
TALIESIN: But he wouldn't have known this was
coming, though.

00:25:07.235 --> 00:25:09.327
LAURA: No, but he was one of them.

00:25:09.327 --> 00:25:15.944
LIAM: It's possible they might not have been working
in conjunction with each other. They could have been

00:25:15.944 --> 00:25:18.616
on their own, all of them, or all together, I
don't know.

00:25:18.616 --> 00:25:24.361
TALIESIN: It does open the door to some definite
possibilities.

00:25:24.361 --> 00:25:30.745
MARISHA: The timing was perfect. That's all I'm
saying.

00:25:30.745 --> 00:25:32.110
TALIESIN: The timing was perfect.

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:36.810
TRAVIS: You know the best way to flush out
something like that? If someone was a spy.

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:39.607
(laughter)

00:25:39.607 --> 00:25:43.234
SAM: All right, I'll do it, I'll go and--

00:25:43.234 --> 00:25:45.761
MARISHA: What if we go and find a shady
individual, like he was saying. What if we don't

00:25:45.761 --> 00:25:47.681
send in Scanlan. What if we find someone?

00:25:47.681 --> 00:25:49.285
SAM: That person will surely die.

00:25:49.285 --> 00:25:52.974
(laughter)

00:25:52.974 --> 00:25:54.549
MARISHA: You're probably right.

00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:58.373
TRAVIS: Will surely die. Which I'm all right
with.

00:25:58.373 --> 00:26:03.132
TALIESIN: Let's go find this tunnel that we paid
for.

00:26:03.132 --> 00:26:09.263
LAURA: We need to see-- get in the city and find
some people. Allura, you be safe--

00:26:09.263 --> 00:26:10.584
MATT: "I will."

00:26:10.584 --> 00:26:14.327
LAURA: -- and silent and swift, and you get back
here as quickly as possible.

00:26:14.327 --> 00:26:19.071
TALIESIN: What time is it? When was the last time
we actually took a nap?

00:26:19.071 --> 00:26:24.970
MATT: Oh, it's been quite a while, you guys have
been running since before the meeting in the

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:26.141
Cloudtop District.

00:26:26.141 --> 00:26:27.439
MARISHA: Which happened at nighttime, remember.

00:26:27.439 --> 00:26:28.658
MATT: It happened at dusk.

00:26:28.658 --> 00:26:31.438
LAURA: It's already morning the next day?

00:26:31.438 --> 00:26:34.513
MATT: No, no, it's evening now for you guys.

00:26:34.513 --> 00:26:37.883
MARISHA: What time approximately? After midnight?

00:26:37.883 --> 00:26:39.910
MATT: I'd say it's after midnight, 1AM.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:41.378
LAURA: Ah, fudge.

00:26:41.378 --> 00:26:42.989
TRAVIS: Hot fudge?

00:26:42.989 --> 00:26:48.491
MARISHA: I Druidcraft a little tulip and hand it
to Allura.

00:26:48.491 --> 00:26:53.711
MATT: She takes it, nods, places it in one of
the--

00:26:53.711 --> 00:26:57.059
MARISHA: In case we need to be in contact.

00:26:57.059 --> 00:27:00.281
LIAM: Well, if we go now, we have the benefit of
darkness in the city.

00:27:00.281 --> 00:27:02.202
SAM: Hang on, we're going to go now, without
resting?

00:27:02.202 --> 00:27:06.719
LIAM: I'm not saying that, I'm weighing our
options. If we go now, we can go under the cover

00:27:06.719 --> 00:27:09.036
of night, but we're going to be exhausted.

00:27:09.036 --> 00:27:13.499
TALIESIN: And dragons don't care about night. They
can see perfectly fine.

00:27:13.499 --> 00:27:15.386
MARISHA: Yes, we've learned that much.

00:27:15.386 --> 00:27:18.896
LIAM: Well, let's lie down and take a nap.

00:27:18.896 --> 00:27:20.045
LAURA: Take a nap.

00:27:20.045 --> 00:27:21.290
MARISHA: What time-- Wait, hang on.

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:24.351
LAURA: Sleep as little as possible that will
actually get us rested.

00:27:24.351 --> 00:27:26.237
MATT: A short rest or a long rest?

00:27:26.237 --> 00:27:27.967
LAURA: Long rest.

00:27:27.967 --> 00:27:29.493
MATT: Long rest is eight hours.

00:27:29.493 --> 00:27:31.757
LAURA: Should we sleep and get up in the
morning and hit it?

00:27:31.757 --> 00:27:37.698
TALIESIN: It'll at least give everybody time to go
to ground.

00:27:37.698 --> 00:27:45.462
LAURA: That's true. I mean, can I sense Thordak
and figure out, I mean, is he just settling in

00:27:45.462 --> 00:27:49.924
that one spot? Is there anything else around or is
it just him in the center, being a dick, and no

00:27:49.924 --> 00:27:52.112
other movement of other things?

00:27:52.112 --> 00:27:58.385
MATT: You took a while earlier to concentrate and
you focus on that point again. Thordak is this

00:27:58.385 --> 00:28:03.972
giant oppressive force of dragon kin in the center
of the city, seemingly not moving.

00:28:03.972 --> 00:28:08.025
LIAM: And last week, you said that Vex couldn't
sense the other three.

00:28:08.025 --> 00:28:09.072
MATT: Correct.

00:28:09.072 --> 00:28:11.680
LAURA: They went to hit the other cities,
obviously.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:19.036
MARISHA: I still have one 5th-level spell left. I
can Commune with Nature and try and find out if a

00:28:19.036 --> 00:28:24.741
few people are still left in the city before we go
to sleep.

00:28:24.741 --> 00:28:26.045
LIAM: Might as well.

00:28:26.045 --> 00:28:27.472
MARISHA: If we're not going out.

00:28:27.472 --> 00:28:29.669
LAURA: What?

00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:34.459
MARISHA: I can Commune with Nature and try to find
certain people.

00:28:34.459 --> 00:28:35.866
LAURA: Should we? Yeah.

00:28:35.866 --> 00:28:41.832
MARISHA: All right. I go out to Pike and the
Sarenrae temple.

00:28:41.832 --> 00:28:51.117
MATT: Okay, so as you go the temple, you can see
the surviving 25 people that are all lumped in.

00:28:51.117 --> 00:28:56.607
They're calmer right now, but you can see a lot of
them are still consoling each other and talking

00:28:56.607 --> 00:29:00.374
and as soon as you walk in they're like-- a couple
of them step up immediately like, "What's going

00:29:00.374 --> 00:29:03.626
"on, is everything all right?" "I'm sorry. Mom, I'm
sorry" They start crying and, "Shh! It's okay,

00:29:03.626 --> 00:29:09.170
"it's okay. Is everything all right? Are we safe
here? Is this okay?"

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:15.525
MARISHA: You will be all right. Everyone calm
down. We've had a rough day and it's been hard on

00:29:15.525 --> 00:29:23.247
everyone but you should be safe here for the
evening. Hopefully. Everyone--

00:29:23.247 --> 00:29:24.530
TRAVIS: Do better.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:27.924
MARISHA: Look, I'm not-- I'm trying on this whole
leadership thing, okay?

00:29:27.924 --> 00:29:30.230
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:33.892
MARISHA: Ugh.

00:29:33.892 --> 00:29:40.720
TALIESIN: Ouch, I didn't know it went that low.
I'm sorry.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.726
MARISHA: Eight.

00:29:42.726 --> 00:29:49.374
MATT: Surprisingly, I rolled a one. First roll of
the night.

00:29:49.374 --> 00:29:52.601
MARISHA: Any little bit of hope works.

00:29:52.601 --> 00:29:58.915
MATT: Yeah, apparently. So the one man who stood
up, and the younger child to him, looks around and

00:29:58.915 --> 00:30:07.643
he tells her, "Shh! Go lay down. Very well, thank
you again. We're sorry for--" Everyone else in the

00:30:07.643 --> 00:30:13.715
room nods in agreement and you see they're dirt-
and tear-stained and all just happy to not be on

00:30:13.715 --> 00:30:15.320
fire right now or frozen.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.758
TRAVIS: Are there any injuries in the room that we
haven't attended to?

00:30:17.853 --> 00:30:22.181
MATT: There have been a few injuries. However,
Pike has already taken time with Keyleth to see to

00:30:22.181 --> 00:30:23.898
them, when they first arrived.

00:30:23.898 --> 00:30:25.692
LAURA: Hey Matt, I was helping, too, mother--

00:30:25.692 --> 00:30:28.184
MATT: You were helping until you were pulled away
for the five minutes.

00:30:28.184 --> 00:30:30.089
TRAVIS: Good job, Pike. And you too, Vex.

00:30:30.089 --> 00:30:32.812
ASHLEY: Yeah, you know, got to help the group.

00:30:32.812 --> 00:30:41.076
MATT: All right, so, as you guys are having this
conversation, Allura and Drake walk their way out

00:30:41.076 --> 00:30:48.742
to the courtyard and she looks back at the rest of
you and goes, "Stay safe, and if anything happens,

00:30:48.742 --> 00:30:55.204
"find a way to let me know. I will return as soon
as I can with what I can find. Possibly who I can find."

00:30:55.204 --> 00:30:57.024
LAURA: Wait!

00:30:57.024 --> 00:31:01.313
MARISHA: Secrets!

00:31:01.313 --> 00:31:08.933
TRAVIS: Don't forget to visit Gilmore's Glorious
Goods.

00:31:08.933 --> 00:31:14.424
SAM: That's not a real place, Travis, it doesn't
exist.

00:31:14.424 --> 00:31:19.817
TRAVIS: Who's Travis? I can't just hop in 
and out of character.

00:31:19.817 --> 00:31:22.187
SAM: Grog, who are you talking to?

00:31:22.187 --> 00:31:23.934
TRAVIS: My sword.

00:31:23.934 --> 00:31:29.171
MARISHA: Your sword. You're promoting Gilmore's to
your sword.

00:31:29.171 --> 00:31:32.108
MATT: So go ahead and roll for me.

00:31:32.108 --> 00:31:33.405
LAURA: Okay.

00:31:33.405 --> 00:31:34.842
TRAVIS: What?

00:31:34.842 --> 00:31:38.799
LAURA: Whoa! 24.

00:31:38.799 --> 00:31:47.132
MATT: Okay. All right. So as you and Allura
embrace, she steps back and gives a nod and looks

00:31:47.132 --> 00:31:48.684
out to everybody.

00:31:48.684 --> 00:31:57.875
MARISHA: I reach out and I grab her hand and say,
thank you, truly, for everything.

00:31:57.875 --> 00:32:05.292
MATT: "Don't thank me yet. Most of all of this
lies on my shoulders." And you can see she's

00:32:05.292 --> 00:32:17.382
holding it together the best she can, but there is
a crippling guilt in her visual presence, based on

00:32:17.382 --> 00:32:22.410
everything that's happening here. You know that
there's a mutual understanding that, while no one

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:27.630
knows the true reason why all this is happening,
everyone seems to have a stake as to why it

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:32.241
happened and possibly may have been somewhat at
fault. And as she nods, she looks at Drake and

00:32:32.241 --> 00:32:38.243
Drake gives her a nod and begins casting a spell.
As his fingers twirl in the air, these blue sparks

00:32:38.243 --> 00:32:46.158
trail his fingertips as it draws this large spiral
of electrical energy that holds itself in place.

00:32:46.158 --> 00:32:51.562
It bursts out and encompasses both their bodies
and their forms all of a sudden shrink down and

00:32:51.562 --> 00:32:56.376
shutter into these two sparks of energy that then
arc off, and you can see these two bolts of

00:32:56.376 --> 00:33:01.513
electricity now coasting through the sky, bouncing
off roads, bouncing off rock, bouncing off a tree.

00:33:01.513 --> 00:33:04.223
They both are traveling via spark across the
countryside.

00:33:04.223 --> 00:33:06.290
LAURA: How the fuck do we get that ability?

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:07.562
MARISHA: I don't know, but I want it.

00:33:07.562 --> 00:33:10.819
LAURA: She's so fucking cool. Do you think that
was her or do you think that was Drake?

00:33:10.819 --> 00:33:12.197
MATT: Drake cast it.

00:33:12.197 --> 00:33:13.805
LAURA: Oh man, that's so cool!

00:33:13.805 --> 00:33:18.529
SAM: Should we go to sleep?

00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:22.932
MARISHA: Well, I'm doing my Commune with Nature
spell. I drop down and mediate.

00:33:22.932 --> 00:33:25.098
MATT: All righty.

00:33:25.098 --> 00:33:32.832
SAM: If only I had taken a dump in the middle of
town, I could see what's going on right now.

00:33:32.832 --> 00:33:34.917
(laughter)

00:33:34.917 --> 00:33:37.441
TRAVIS: Hindsight is ten--

00:33:37.441 --> 00:33:38.698
SAM: Other number.

00:33:38.698 --> 00:33:41.175
(laughter)

00:33:41.175 --> 00:33:45.972
MATT: Okay, three facts of your choice. As you sit
in the temple quietly and connect yourself with

00:33:45.972 --> 00:33:52.110
the land and the foliage of the surrounding area
of Emon, what are your questions?

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.211
MARISHA: Do I sense Gilmore's presence?

00:33:54.211 --> 00:33:57.951
MATT: What's the radius on this, three miles?

00:33:57.951 --> 00:33:59.816
MARISHA: A few miles.

00:33:59.816 --> 00:34:02.885
MATT: You do sense a presence.

00:34:02.885 --> 00:34:04.827
MARISHA: A presence.

00:34:04.827 --> 00:34:06.625
MATT: A very weak presence.

00:34:06.625 --> 00:34:07.956
LAURA: (gasp) Oh, no!

00:34:07.956 --> 00:34:10.311
SAM: That could mean he's far away or that he's
dead.

00:34:10.311 --> 00:34:17.686
MARISHA: Can I focus in even harder and find
where that presence is coming from more directly?

00:34:17.686 --> 00:34:24.442
MATT: The direction that best you can ascertain is
it's in the direction of Abdar's Promenade.

00:34:24.442 --> 00:34:26.867
MARISHA: His shop?

00:34:26.867 --> 00:34:28.972
MATT: That's where his shop is, yes.

00:34:28.972 --> 00:34:31.973
SAM: Good to know.

00:34:31.973 --> 00:34:39.355
MARISHA: Okay. Last question, do I sense Uriel?

00:34:39.355 --> 00:34:43.635
MATT: Within your three-mile range, you do not.

00:34:43.635 --> 00:34:45.987
LAURA: Maybe he--

00:34:45.987 --> 00:34:47.722
TRAVIS: He got to moving.

00:34:47.722 --> 00:34:49.007
SAM: Or he's dead.

00:34:49.007 --> 00:34:53.266
LAURA: Okay, when you are sensing things, does
that mean you would sense if they were alive or

00:34:53.266 --> 00:34:56.477
you wouldn't sense them at all if they were dead?

00:34:56.477 --> 00:35:01.737
MATT: The questions were: are they in the city?
Which direction are they? Those are essentially

00:35:01.737 --> 00:35:04.304
the answers that you get through the connection of
nature.

00:35:04.304 --> 00:35:06.925
LAURA: Okay, so they could be dead in the city and
you'd still sense them?

00:35:06.925 --> 00:35:09.582
MATT: That's possible.

00:35:09.582 --> 00:35:12.822
MARISHA: I don't know. It's hard to say.

00:35:12.822 --> 00:35:16.853
LIAM: He could have gone to the harbor. He could
have fled through the tunnels we don't even know

00:35:16.853 --> 00:35:17.686
about.

00:35:17.686 --> 00:35:19.165
LAURA: He could have a teleportation circle.

00:35:19.165 --> 00:35:20.917
MARISHA: We should check his shop first.

00:35:20.917 --> 00:35:23.659
TRAVIS: Yeah. If Uriel's farther away, it's--

00:35:23.659 --> 00:35:25.592
MARISHA: Uriel, I don't know.

00:35:25.592 --> 00:35:30.238
Maybe he's dead, maybe he's gone, I don't
know, I don't know.

00:35:30.238 --> 00:35:32.837
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a moo point.

00:35:32.837 --> 00:35:38.979
MARISHA: How about this, let's find Gilmore, if
he's alive or dead then that will answer a lot of

00:35:38.979 --> 00:35:40.484
questions, how's that?

00:35:40.484 --> 00:35:42.553
LIAM: I agree.

00:35:42.553 --> 00:35:43.852
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:35:43.852 --> 00:35:52.461
LIAM: And if he did not make it, we still go to
his shop.

00:35:52.461 --> 00:35:54.636
SAM: Take everything.

00:35:54.636 --> 00:36:01.154
LIAM: Use whatever's left. It's what Gilmore would
want.

00:36:01.154 --> 00:36:02.864
SAM: It's true.

00:36:02.864 --> 00:36:04.562
TRAVIS: I agree.

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:07.405
LAURA: We go then, if it hasn't been ransacked
already.

00:36:07.405 --> 00:36:08.770
TRAVIS: Let's go find that magic fucker.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:10.744
MARISHA: So we're going now? Tonight?

00:36:10.744 --> 00:36:12.128
TALIESIN: Sleep and then go.

00:36:12.128 --> 00:36:14.495
MARISHA: I don't know, maybe we should go.

00:36:14.495 --> 00:36:18.746
LAURA: Should we stealth in and see what we can
see? I don't know, I feel like we need to rest, y'all.

00:36:18.746 --> 00:36:20.522
MARISHA: How bad are we?

00:36:20.522 --> 00:36:25.604
LIAM: (laughing) I should probably rest.

00:36:25.604 --> 00:36:28.154
ASHLEY: I'm at 25.

00:36:28.154 --> 00:36:29.551
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

00:36:29.551 --> 00:36:32.087
LAURA: I'm pretty low and I'm almost out of dice.

00:36:32.087 --> 00:36:37.548
TRAVIS: I can stay guard with the rest of
everybody else, because I'm okay.

00:36:37.548 --> 00:36:43.153
LIAM: They're expecting-- Thordak is expecting to
sit on us like a bunch of eggs in a basket. We're

00:36:43.153 --> 00:36:44.911
fine for the night, we go tomorrow.

00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:48.108
LAURA: Potentially.

00:36:48.108 --> 00:36:49.876
MARISHA: Okay.

00:36:49.876 --> 00:36:51.983
MATT: All right, you guys take a long rest?

00:36:51.983 --> 00:36:54.747
TALIESIN: Quick question, where is the skull?

00:36:54.747 --> 00:36:57.337
TRAVIS: You fucking-- that was my question.

00:36:57.337 --> 00:36:59.576
LAURA: I don't know, what are you talking about?

00:36:59.576 --> 00:37:01.990
MATT: Who had the skull last?

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:06.255
TRAVIS: You expect me to remember those sort of
things?

00:37:06.255 --> 00:37:08.370
MARISHA: I remember.

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:12.606
TALIESIN: Either you have it or I have it. I don't
remember.

00:37:12.606 --> 00:37:14.983
MATT: The last person to hold it was Vex.

00:37:14.983 --> 00:37:18.972
TALIESIN: Was Vex. Okay, excellent. I have a
perfectly reasonable hiding place or, if you like,

00:37:18.972 --> 00:37:20.192
you can take it.

00:37:20.192 --> 00:37:21.807
TRAVIS: Yeah, your ass.

00:37:21.807 --> 00:37:25.923
LAURA: Yes, I think it's reasonably well-hidden at
this moment.

00:37:25.923 --> 00:37:27.475
TALIESIN: Excellent.

00:37:27.475 --> 00:37:28.720
SAM: Where is it?

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.973
LAURA: I don't know.

00:37:29.973 --> 00:37:31.334
MARISHA: Well-hidden.

00:37:31.334 --> 00:37:34.761
TALIESIN: That will do.

00:37:34.761 --> 00:37:42.938
MATT: All right. You guys find yourselves, as best
as you can, resting for the evening. It is an

00:37:42.938 --> 00:37:50.662
evening of tossing and turning for a lot of you.
Flashes of memories. Scanlan, you are plagued by

00:37:50.662 --> 00:37:54.428
the thought of your newly discovered daughter
being not far outside the city when all this went

00:37:54.428 --> 00:38:01.979
down. Percy, you have flashes of the idea of
Whitestone, recently saved and brought to freedom,

00:38:01.979 --> 00:38:09.484
being torn asunder by dragons not two weeks
afterwards. You are plagued by visions of the

00:38:09.484 --> 00:38:19.697
Pyrah, the moment that Thordak must have torn
through and the havoc that was wreaked afterward.

00:38:19.697 --> 00:38:27.607
Both of you can't help but think back to when you first
returned to Byroden and seeing the smoldering ruin

00:38:27.607 --> 00:38:35.399
that you now know to be the work of the Cinder
King 15 years before, and those words about

00:38:35.399 --> 00:38:42.753
wondering if that was the last thing your mother saw.
Grog, you want that skull.

00:38:42.753 --> 00:38:46.686
(laughter)

00:38:46.686 --> 00:38:56.028
MATT: Pike, your thoughts go back to Vasselheim
and the people there that you, out of necessity

00:38:56.028 --> 00:39:02.005
and need for friendship and to protect them, left
behind, knowing that they would be safe, and

00:39:02.005 --> 00:39:06.492
now the uncertainty as to whether or not
Vasselheim still stands and whether or not you

00:39:06.492 --> 00:39:12.262
left them to a fate you could have protected them.
That guilt rides on you as well. You guys complete

00:39:12.262 --> 00:39:22.484
your long rest, you restore full hit points and
you get back half of your max hit dice. You can

00:39:22.484 --> 00:39:29.264
only get back half, so if you spent more than half of
your hit dice, you're still at-- just so you guys

00:39:29.264 --> 00:39:30.616
are aware of that.

00:39:30.616 --> 00:39:33.053
MARISHA: Wait, what? We only restore half each
night?

00:39:33.053 --> 00:39:34.218
MATT: Yes.

00:39:34.218 --> 00:39:35.910
TALIESIN: Not half of what's missing, but--

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:37.075
MARISHA: Just half.

00:39:37.075 --> 00:39:43.373
MATT: Yeah. So if you used eight of your hit dice,
you are only going to get back, at level 12, six

00:39:43.373 --> 00:39:44.590
hit dice.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:46.961
MARISHA: Good to know. I don't think I used any.

00:39:46.961 --> 00:39:51.023
MATT: So, it is a gradual declining resource.
Hasn't come up too much beforehand, but I want to

00:39:51.023 --> 00:39:58.837
make sure you guys were aware of that. Anyway, as
you come to in the morning, you can smell-- you're

00:39:58.837 --> 00:40:03.083
used to Laina cooking a very nice breakfast. You
smell food being cooked, but it's much more basic

00:40:03.083 --> 00:40:10.578
for the masses. As you eventually groggily find
your way downstairs, pardon the pun, you can see

00:40:10.578 --> 00:40:16.505
there is essentially a gruel pot and there is a
soup line and food is being served best to their

00:40:16.505 --> 00:40:25.026
capabilities to the people that have taken refuge
in Greyskull Keep. You are welcome to do as you please.

00:40:25.026 --> 00:40:31.582
LAURA: We should head out.

00:40:31.582 --> 00:40:33.073
TALIESIN: I'm ready.

00:40:33.073 --> 00:40:35.325
SAM: We're just going to march into the city?

00:40:35.325 --> 00:40:37.216
LAURA: We're going to march under the city.

00:40:37.216 --> 00:40:38.953
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going to check out that tunnel
first.

00:40:38.953 --> 00:40:40.859
SAM: The tunnel just goes to the other side of the
wall.

00:40:40.859 --> 00:40:44.581
LIAM: We don't even know where the tunnel is. We
need to find an entrance to said tunnel.

00:40:44.581 --> 00:40:47.581
MATT: The tunnel, actually--

00:40:47.581 --> 00:40:52.313
TRAVIS: And then-- sorry, I was going to say and
then when we get to the the city, then we figure

00:40:52.313 --> 00:40:54.013
out what we do.

00:40:54.013 --> 00:40:57.306
SAM: Grog, good thinking. (laughs)

00:40:57.306 --> 00:40:59.244
TRAVIS: Leave it to me.

00:40:59.244 --> 00:41:03.468
MATT: So, the tunnel has been installed to the
back of the kitchen. There is a large pantry there

00:41:03.468 --> 00:41:09.970
and the tunnel is a trap door that is currently
set by the very, very back of the pantry.

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:18.651
Actually, not too dissimilar from the entrance to
the Clasp in the Diamond Nest Inn. However, it's

00:41:18.651 --> 00:41:25.271
much smaller and is a small single-person tunnel.
You have to go single-file and it's not very tall.

00:41:25.271 --> 00:41:29.080
Grog, you are going to have to almost crawl
through at your height and everyone else would

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.555
have to hunch down, except for you and Pike are
fine. You guys are tiny enough. It's about a

00:41:32.555 --> 00:41:33.774
gnome-sized tunnel.

00:41:33.774 --> 00:41:35.134
SAM: Nice.

00:41:35.134 --> 00:41:41.632
MATT: And as you guys go into the pantry, Laina is
like, "Oh, don't-- I'm trying-- where's everyone going?"

00:41:41.632 --> 00:41:43.896
and sees you all clown-car into the
pantry.

00:41:43.896 --> 00:41:46.541
LAURA: Before we left, I wanted to find Jarett
really fast.

00:41:46.541 --> 00:41:52.288
MATT: Okay, Jarett is currently outside of the
keep in the main courtyard area, crossbow at the

00:41:52.288 --> 00:41:55.847
ready, keeping his eyes to the sky, mostly looking
off in the direction of Emon.

00:41:55.847 --> 00:42:07.698
LAURA: I walk up and I hand him a bag of 300 gold
and I say, this is, far and away, so much more

00:42:07.698 --> 00:42:14.562
than we asked you to do when we hired you. And I
appreciate everything you're doing. Take care of

00:42:14.562 --> 00:42:19.756
the keep. Use this money to take care of the
people here.

00:42:19.756 --> 00:42:26.371
MATT: He takes it and throws it in the air and
catches it. "I appreciate that. I take great pride

00:42:26.371 --> 00:42:32.405
"in my work and I assure you, I would sooner die
than let this place fall."

00:42:32.405 --> 00:42:36.174
LAURA: Then I give him additional 100 gold.

00:42:36.174 --> 00:42:38.180
SAM: What is going on?

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:42.774
MATT: As you pass him the 100 gold, he puts his
hand up and actually pushes your hand away and

00:42:42.774 --> 00:42:47.731
says, "I appreciate the sentiment, but you've
already done too much. You hired me for a reason.

00:42:47.731 --> 00:42:51.618
"I'm doing my job, but your generosity is noted."

00:42:51.618 --> 00:42:54.337
SAM: Ah, he's so honorable!

00:42:54.337 --> 00:42:58.021
TRAVIS: Is his hair blowing in the wind as he
rejects that amount?

00:42:58.021 --> 00:42:59.768
MATT: His hair is really short.

00:42:59.768 --> 00:43:03.676
LAURA: I resist the urge to mug down with him and
I walk away.

00:43:03.676 --> 00:43:06.301
MATT: Okay.

00:43:06.301 --> 00:43:08.085
LIAM: What are you waiting for?

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:10.194
(laughter)

00:43:10.194 --> 00:43:11.292
MATT: All right.

00:43:11.292 --> 00:43:12.714
TRAVIS: Yeah, you might die. He might die.

00:43:12.714 --> 00:43:16.146
LIAM: Yeah. Look at that big pouty bottom lip. Go
get that.

00:43:16.146 --> 00:43:17.897
(laughter)

00:43:17.897 --> 00:43:19.585
MATT: Some of that Marquet--

00:43:19.585 --> 00:43:21.402
(laughter)

00:43:21.402 --> 00:43:23.209
MARISHA: Sexy, sexy exotic accent.

00:43:23.209 --> 00:43:30.028
MATT: -- and that Ank'Harel caramel skin. Jarett's
a hottie.

00:43:30.028 --> 00:43:34.363
LIAM: I just saw 100 pictures drawn in a instant.

00:43:34.363 --> 00:43:36.534
(laughter)

00:43:36.534 --> 00:43:38.525
TALIESIN: With a flair.

00:43:38.525 --> 00:43:43.387
MARISHA: Wait, you hear that? It's pens hitting
the paper. It's fanfiction right now.

00:43:43.387 --> 00:43:50.360
MATT: So, as you guys make your way through the
tunnel, and it's a long, very simple tunnel. The

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:54.046
construction is solid. You don't feel as you walk
through that any of it is in worry of collapse.

00:43:54.046 --> 00:44:00.782
There has been no sufficient seismic activity or
impact above ground to warrant that directly above

00:44:00.782 --> 00:44:07.961
the tunnel. And you continue to trudge ahead and
it's pitch black. Those of you with darkvision

00:44:07.961 --> 00:44:10.963
probably take the forefront.

00:44:10.963 --> 00:44:14.781
TRAVIS: Is there a light vision? I'm on it.

00:44:14.781 --> 00:44:18.237
MARISHA: I go ahead and light up a hand.

00:44:18.237 --> 00:44:24.311
MATT: So, you guys, all of you have low-light,
darkvision. You're fine and Percy is the only one

00:44:24.311 --> 00:44:33.737
who needs the aid in this. But as you continue
forward for a good 25, 30 minutes or so, the

00:44:33.737 --> 00:44:38.511
tunnel comes to a small stop and there's a very
simple rope ladder that leads upward.

00:44:38.511 --> 00:44:41.093
LAURA: I put my hood up.

00:44:41.093 --> 00:44:43.587
MATT: Who's going up first?

00:44:43.587 --> 00:44:45.229
TRAVIS: Is there anything past that?

00:44:45.229 --> 00:44:52.442
MATT: The ladder goes up and goes into a small
wooden slat. It's not even a door. It's almost

00:44:52.442 --> 00:44:54.695
like a wood pallet.

00:44:54.695 --> 00:44:56.593
LAURA: Get up there. See what you see.

00:44:56.593 --> 00:44:58.014
TRAVIS: You sneaky dick.

00:44:58.014 --> 00:45:03.437
LIAM: Okay, at the bottom of the ladder, because
she's right behind me. You know, you never cease

00:45:03.437 --> 00:45:05.217
to impress me.

00:45:05.217 --> 00:45:08.899
MATT: Okay, you go up. Roll a stealth check.

00:45:08.899 --> 00:45:13.793
LIAM: 25.

00:45:13.793 --> 00:45:19.467
MATT: All right, good to know. So, as you get up
to the top, you feel the wooden slats on top and

00:45:19.606 --> 00:45:23.524
as you push, there's not any weight to them. They
give way immediately, and as you push it aside,

00:45:23.524 --> 00:45:28.948
you can see you're inside a small wooden
structure. It is enclosed and a little bit of the

00:45:28.948 --> 00:45:35.723
morning light is peeking through the space between
the slats of wood. Looking about the general size

00:45:35.723 --> 00:45:40.700
and height, it appears to almost be an outhouse
structure, but there is no actual outhouse here

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:43.906
or, at least where there once was, has recently
been converted to the exit of your tunnel.

00:45:43.906 --> 00:45:45.770
LIAM: Smells like jerky.

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:47.928
(laughter)

00:45:47.928 --> 00:45:50.148
TALIESIN: Right there with you.

00:45:50.148 --> 00:45:52.671
MATT: There is a door that leads out.

00:45:52.671 --> 00:45:56.370
LIAM: Okay, I will crack it an inch and look
through.

00:45:56.370 --> 00:46:02.245
MATT: Okay. There is a chain on the outside of the
door that keeps it shut with a big, thick lock at

00:46:02.245 --> 00:46:03.474
the bottom.

00:46:03.474 --> 00:46:05.991
LIAM: Is there enough room to get my hand through
to the other side?

00:46:05.991 --> 00:46:11.263
MATT: I'd say, yes, with your experience and your
lithe form, you manage to just eke it through and

00:46:11.263 --> 00:46:13.316
you can get your wrist past, but anything
beyond--

00:46:13.316 --> 00:46:14.870
LIAM: I'm double-jointed, Matt.

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:19.785
MATT: And with that double joint you get &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;
close. So, yeah, you can reach it.

00:46:19.785 --> 00:46:21.753
LIAM: All right, so, I can feel a lock there?

00:46:21.753 --> 00:46:22.708
MATT: Yeah.

00:46:22.708 --> 00:46:24.394
LIAM: All right, I'm going to one-hand pick this
lock.

00:46:24.394 --> 00:46:29.463
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll. This is a difficult
maneuver, even with your experience. Given that

00:46:29.463 --> 00:46:32.310
you can't actually see the front of the lock,
you're having to literally feel your way through it.

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:35.055
TRAVIS: Roll high, you pointy-eared bastard.

00:46:35.055 --> 00:46:36.327
LAURA: Natural 20.

00:46:36.327 --> 00:46:37.795
MARISHA: It's like unclasping a bra.

00:46:37.795 --> 00:46:39.493
TALIESIN: How do you do that?

00:46:39.493 --> 00:46:42.446
LIAM: That's 30.

00:46:42.446 --> 00:46:48.743
MATT: (laughs) 30? With a single moment, you,
actually feeling with one thumb, you're feeling

00:46:48.743 --> 00:46:53.453
the vibration of each tumbler on the inside of the
lock and as each one progressively clicks, you

00:46:53.453 --> 00:46:57.913
eventually get to the fourth one before (tink) and
it hangs open loosely, within a matter of 40

00:46:57.913 --> 00:47:01.781
seconds. You wish other people would have seen
that happen because that was pretty, pretty cool

00:47:01.781 --> 00:47:03.899
maneuver. But you know, at least.

00:47:03.899 --> 00:47:06.172
LIAM: Come on up. It wasn't even locked.

00:47:06.172 --> 00:47:08.748
ALL: Aw.

00:47:08.748 --> 00:47:11.045
(laughter)

00:47:11.045 --> 00:47:16.447
MATT: He's so modest. Oh no, we lost Ashley! We
lost an Ashley.

00:47:16.447 --> 00:47:19.245
LIAM: I've got it. I've got it.

00:47:19.245 --> 00:47:20.761
MARISHA: Cleric down.

00:47:20.761 --> 00:47:22.613
MATT: As you all climb back up--

00:47:22.613 --> 00:47:25.930
LAURA: Stealth, stealth, stealth, everybody. I
cast Pass Without a Trace.

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:28.368
MARISHA: Oh. She's going to call back. She said we
turned into robots. She disconnected.

00:47:28.368 --> 00:47:29.813
MATT: Okay, gotcha.

00:47:29.813 --> 00:47:31.749
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on us.

00:47:31.749 --> 00:47:32.937
MATT: Okay, good. So--

00:47:32.937 --> 00:47:37.741
LAURA: Wait, wait! How's Trinket going to climb up
this rope, y'all? Polymorph?

00:47:37.741 --> 00:47:39.907
MARISHA: I do have Polymorph.

00:47:39.907 --> 00:47:41.531
SAM: Oh no.

00:47:41.531 --> 00:47:44.191
MARISHA: We need to make him tinier, anyway. What
do you want him to be?

00:47:44.191 --> 00:47:46.141
SAM: We should leave him.

00:47:46.141 --> 00:47:47.425
LAURA: Shut up!

00:47:47.425 --> 00:47:49.895
MATT: Which, for the record, Trinket going through
this tunnel looks like the cleaner in

00:47:49.895 --> 00:47:54.907
Labyrinth. It fills the entire tunnel. He's like
(bear noises) having to pull his way through.

00:47:54.907 --> 00:48:07.271
LAURA: Okay, what if we polymorph him into a very
small raccoon? But he's got hands, you know, so he

00:48:07.271 --> 00:48:08.598
can hold things?

00:48:08.598 --> 00:48:10.968
LIAM: What about a wolverine or a badger?

00:48:10.968 --> 00:48:12.183
MARISHA: I have a question.

00:48:12.183 --> 00:48:13.874
SAM: Honey badger doesn't care.

00:48:13.874 --> 00:48:16.502
LAURA: Honey badger don't give a shit. It just
takes what it wants.

00:48:16.502 --> 00:48:24.598
MARISHA: If I polymorph Trinket, can I then use
Beast Sense to be able to see through him? Would

00:48:24.598 --> 00:48:26.078
that be able to work?

00:48:26.078 --> 00:48:27.419
MATT: What does Beast Sense do?

00:48:27.419 --> 00:48:30.864
MARISHA: Beast Sense lets me see through the eyes
of a beast.

00:48:30.864 --> 00:48:33.247
MATT: You can do that with Trinket regardless.

00:48:33.247 --> 00:48:37.352
MARISHA: But does it stack with Polymorph? And if
he is like polymorphed into-- I mean, I guess he's

00:48:37.352 --> 00:48:38.674
still a beast.

00:48:38.674 --> 00:48:42.546
MATT: If beast sense is a concentration, then no.
You will lose one to do the other.

00:48:42.546 --> 00:48:43.778
MARISHA: All right.

00:48:43.778 --> 00:48:45.420
MATT: Yeah, and Beast Sense is concentration.

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:47.270
LAURA: Is Polymorph a concentration?

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:49.612
MATT: Yes, it is. So one or the other.

00:48:49.733 --> 00:48:52.841
MARISHA: It's fine. But if I turned him into a
bird, I can make him an aerial scout, is what I

00:48:52.841 --> 00:48:56.072
was thinking, like the wargs in Game of Thrones.

00:48:56.072 --> 00:49:01.901
MATT: Or you can become one yourself. What are you
doing?

00:49:01.901 --> 00:49:07.980
MARISHA: I will make him a cute little sewer rat
or like--

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:12.001
LAURA: No! He can hang on to me.

00:49:12.001 --> 00:49:13.610
TRAVIS: Oh my god, make him something!

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:15.341
LAURA: Will he still get his armor?

00:49:15.341 --> 00:49:17.568
MARISHA: Can I make him a lemur? (laughs)

00:49:17.568 --> 00:49:18.732
MATT: You can.

00:49:18.732 --> 00:49:20.888
LAURA: But lemurs are slow, dude. Raccoons are
cool.

00:49:20.888 --> 00:49:23.210
MARISHA: How about a red panda?

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:24.439
LAURA: Red panda!

00:49:24.439 --> 00:49:25.896
MARISHA: I'm going to make him a red panda!

00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:27.239
TALIESIN: Red panda. That's cool.

00:49:27.239 --> 00:49:30.004
SAM: Wait, wait, wait, can a red panda climb a
rope ladder any better than--

00:49:30.004 --> 00:49:39.781
MATT: As the rest of the party climbs their way
up, during Vex and Keyleth's bickering over what

00:49:39.781 --> 00:49:43.864
form Trinket should take, Trinket, if you've ever
seen a bear roll its eyes before, this is the

00:49:43.864 --> 00:49:49.296
moment. As it fills the entire tunnel it goes
(bear noises), with a kill-me-now expression.

00:49:49.296 --> 00:49:51.456
Eventually, you decide on a red panda.

00:49:51.456 --> 00:49:52.833
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a good breed.

00:49:52.833 --> 00:50:00.798
MATT: The mystical red panda from Wildemount. You
extend your hand and Trinket's form shrinks into

00:50:00.798 --> 00:50:04.901
this small, temporarily elevated red panda, and
falls to the ground.

00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:11.209
LAURA: Aww, I love you! He's so cute! I pick him
up and I tell him to hang on to me.

00:50:11.209 --> 00:50:18.648
MATT: He does and wraps around your neck like the
foxtail you already have there. You guys climb up

00:50:18.648 --> 00:50:24.860
and as you emerge, you see now, you're at the
very, very back of an alleyway that is buttressed

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:30.571
against the inside of the outer wall. So you're
inside the city. You're in this small, very, very

00:50:30.571 --> 00:50:37.427
well-out-of-the-way alleyway, this back alley that
ends at your outhouse, as well as a secondary one

00:50:37.427 --> 00:50:43.076
next to you that appears to be functional, based
on the smell. And there is trash and junk back

00:50:43.076 --> 00:50:46.510
here. It's definitely one of the forgotten corners
of Emon.

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:48.427
TALIESIN: You have your map.

00:50:48.427 --> 00:50:51.810
SAM: Yeah, we're right here. Where's Gilmore's
again?

00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:56.162
MATT: Abdar's Promenade, to the northeastern--

00:50:56.162 --> 00:50:58.086
LAURA: Stealth. Can we all stealth?

00:50:58.086 --> 00:51:00.640
SAM: That's up here. Wow, we have to cross the
entire city.

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.439
MARISHA: And we've got Pass Without a Trace.

00:51:02.439 --> 00:51:04.134
SAM: But we could go along the wall.

00:51:04.134 --> 00:51:05.224
LAURA: Let's do it.

00:51:05.224 --> 00:51:07.736
SAM: All the way along the outside wall.

00:51:07.736 --> 00:51:12.209
MARISHA: Do we want to go through the city or
along the outside of the city? Are we going to

00:51:12.209 --> 00:51:14.385
take the long way or the direct path?

00:51:14.385 --> 00:51:19.430
LIAM: The long way, the slow way, the careful
way.

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:21.119
SAM: Take the beltway?

00:51:21.119 --> 00:51:22.167
LIAM: Stealthy.

00:51:22.167 --> 00:51:23.864
TALIESIN: Stealthy.

00:51:23.864 --> 00:51:25.696
MATT: All right. Everyone roll stealth, please.

00:51:25.696 --> 00:51:29.023
LAURA: You add ten because--

00:51:29.023 --> 00:51:30.673
SAM: We add ten?

00:51:30.673 --> 00:51:41.318
MATT: Ashley, stealth for you as well with
disadvantage, but you add ten. Still there,

00:51:41.318 --> 00:51:42.711
Ashley?

00:51:42.711 --> 00:51:43.987
LAURA: Oh, no!

00:51:43.987 --> 00:51:45.253
TRAVIS: Ashley?

00:51:45.253 --> 00:51:49.424
LIAM: I'm hanging up on you. I still love you, but
I'm going to hang up.

00:51:49.424 --> 00:51:52.875
MATT: All right, so, call back, and you guys,
stealth checks?

00:51:52.875 --> 00:51:56.469
TALIESIN: 39.

00:51:56.469 --> 00:51:57.429
MARISHA: 19.

00:51:57.429 --> 00:51:58.631
SAM: 25.

00:51:58.631 --> 00:51:59.676
LAURA: 33.

00:51:59.676 --> 00:52:00.640
TRAVIS: 23.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.561
LIAM: 25.

00:52:01.561 --> 00:52:02.318
MATT: All right.

00:52:02.318 --> 00:52:03.277
LAURA: You added ten?

00:52:03.277 --> 00:52:04.187
LIAM: What?

00:52:04.187 --> 00:52:05.738
LAURA: Add ten to it. Pass Without a Trace.

00:52:05.738 --> 00:52:07.133
LIAM: 35, then, motherfuckers.

00:52:07.133 --> 00:52:08.449
TALIESIN: Wait, 29, sorry.

00:52:08.449 --> 00:52:10.579
MATT: Okay, there we go, and 19 with the plus
ten?

00:52:10.579 --> 00:52:12.395
MARISHA: Yeah, I rolled shitty.

00:52:12.395 --> 00:52:19.275
MATT: Okay, all right. There we go. Hi, Ashley.

00:52:19.275 --> 00:52:20.992
MARISHA: Sorry, Ashley.

00:52:20.992 --> 00:52:22.526
LAURA: Can she hear?

00:52:22.526 --> 00:52:24.633
LIAM: (robot voice) Hello, I am Pike. I am happy
to be here.

00:52:24.633 --> 00:52:27.581
TALIESIN: I forgot you can do that.

00:52:27.581 --> 00:52:29.009
LIAM: Ashley rolled a four. She texted me.

00:52:29.009 --> 00:52:30.459
LAURA: So 14.

00:52:30.459 --> 00:52:36.603
MATT: Okay, so you guys step out of this alleyway
and the first thing that catches you is the

00:52:36.603 --> 00:52:39.069
visual.

00:52:39.069 --> 00:52:40.713
LAURA: Chained back up the outhouse.

00:52:40.713 --> 00:52:44.240
MATT: Okay, so you chained it back and put the
lock back on. As you step back out into the center

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:48.297
of the first road you come across, the crossroads to
this alleyway, you look up and can see there are,

00:52:48.297 --> 00:52:55.415
even through the night, a good two dozen streams
of smoke billowing out from different parts of the

00:52:55.415 --> 00:53:02.429
city, where, throughout the entire evening, there
has been buildings burning, crumbling, or fires of

00:53:02.429 --> 00:53:10.564
indeterminate origin throughout the city that are
still spreading. There's the perpetual smell of

00:53:10.564 --> 00:53:15.786
smoke and dust in the air, and you can see every
now and then, the wind will blow a bit and a

00:53:15.786 --> 00:53:20.574
little bit of ash will be thrown up in the air and
come to rest. Much of what you see around you is

00:53:20.574 --> 00:53:24.740
intact, the buildings directly around you on this
side, everything seems intact, though there's very

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:31.248
little signs of life on this immediate corner. It
looks like either everyone is inside or this part

00:53:31.248 --> 00:53:38.660
of the city has been abandoned or people are
keeping out of the streets at this point. So, what

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.445
do you guys want to do?

00:53:40.445 --> 00:53:43.017
LAURA: Go along the wall to the other side to get
to Gilmore's?

00:53:43.017 --> 00:53:44.288
MATT: Okay.

00:53:44.288 --> 00:53:45.498
LAURA: Sneaky.

00:53:45.498 --> 00:53:52.895
MATT: All right. You guys coast along the wall, to
the very southward side, trudging up across the

00:53:52.895 --> 00:54:01.493
main gate, which as you can see now-- there's
normally a very heavy guard presence on the south

00:54:01.493 --> 00:54:06.361
gate to Emon. The gate is currently partially
opened and you can see a bunch of the guards as

00:54:06.361 --> 00:54:13.052
well as a number of individuals in the city
currently frozen in place in the midst of a sudden

00:54:13.052 --> 00:54:20.487
bit of chaos. You can see the guards with shields
and pikes at the ready, screaming and looking up

00:54:20.487 --> 00:54:26.716
into the sky, their final moment trapped now in
that frozen horrifying visage. You see people

00:54:26.716 --> 00:54:30.415
running, trying to make their way out of the gate,
and couldn't quite get past in time and the

00:54:30.415 --> 00:54:33.960
gate itself has a large sheet of ice that is
frozen against it that's slowly thawing. You can

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:38.854
see the ground around them is turning muddy with
all the moisture that's slowly melting away as the

00:54:38.854 --> 00:54:40.067
day progresses.

00:54:40.067 --> 00:54:42.662
LAURA: And they're like the people in our keep?
They're past the point of healing?

00:54:42.662 --> 00:54:45.540
MATT: You can certainly check and inquire.

00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:51.473
LIAM: They've been here for eight hours at least.
They're gone.

00:54:51.473 --> 00:54:53.744
TRAVIS: Yeah, leave it.

00:54:53.744 --> 00:54:59.571
LAURA: I want to see if Cure Wounds is-- I'm going
to just try?

00:54:59.571 --> 00:55:01.231
MARISHA: I assist.

00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:07.792
MATT: Okay. So you go up and reach out and cast
Cure Wounds on one of the frozen bodies, and your

00:55:07.792 --> 00:55:11.425
hands touch it and you can feel the ice because
it's still very cold to the touch, though it's

00:55:11.425 --> 00:55:16.530
damp and the moisture is gathering and dripping
down off certain elbows and portions of the body

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:21.883
that are the lowest. You complete the spell and
feel the warmth of the cure spell extend past your

00:55:21.883 --> 00:55:30.458
fingers with no sign of reaction or life within
the body. This poor woman, apron on, looking over

00:55:30.458 --> 00:55:35.825
her shoulder running, holding what little
belongings she had, is there, her final moment

00:55:35.825 --> 00:55:39.790
captured as she stares off in the direction of
where you assume Vorugal swooped towards the south

00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:43.920
gate, before making their way towards Greyskull
Keep the night before.

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:47.134
TRAVIS: Let's go before we're discovered,
quickly.

00:55:47.134 --> 00:55:49.012
MARISHA: Okay.

00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:53.937
MATT: As you guys tread across the main
thoroughfare, and it's the one point where you are

00:55:53.937 --> 00:55:59.444
inescapably out in the open, and as you're taking
a moment touching the corpse of this woman frozen

00:55:59.444 --> 00:56:06.122
in place, Vex, you catch out the corner of your
eye what appears to be a figure stepping towards

00:56:06.122 --> 00:56:08.100
you in the center of the street.

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:12.010
SAM: Wait, you see someone?

00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:16.905
MATT: As you notify the rest of the group, you
guys look over and you can see now, stepping from

00:56:16.905 --> 00:56:22.975
one of the alleyways, there is a humanoid figure
walking through the road, cloak draped behind in

00:56:22.975 --> 00:56:34.651
the back, hood up, wide shoulders, and is not
seemingly making any attempt to be unseen or really

00:56:34.651 --> 00:56:40.232
hiding their presence. This is someone who is
beelining for your group in this moment.

00:56:40.232 --> 00:56:41.924
MARISHA: He's heading towards us?

00:56:41.924 --> 00:56:42.888
MATT: Yes.

00:56:42.888 --> 00:56:44.302
MARISHA: Yeah, does he see us?

00:56:44.302 --> 00:56:45.779
MATT: Heading right towards you.

00:56:45.779 --> 00:56:47.637
LAURA: I take out a arrow and say, stop!

00:56:47.637 --> 00:56:49.955
MARISHA: I do flame hands.

00:56:49.955 --> 00:56:55.327
MATT: Okay. The figure stops for a moment and
pulls the hood back, and you can see now,

00:56:55.327 --> 00:57:04.028
revealed, a-- looking humanoid but the features
are more intense and thick. A very square jaw. The

00:57:04.028 --> 00:57:11.721
skin has a slight grayish-green tint to it. What
looks like one tooth underneath, and this is a

00:57:11.721 --> 00:57:19.398
half-orc individual. Wearing a black cloak and very
simple studded leather armor. If our guest would

00:57:19.398 --> 00:57:21.243
like to step on to the stage.

00:57:21.243 --> 00:57:23.064
ALL: Ooh!

00:57:23.064 --> 00:57:27.159
LIAM: Yeah! Mixing it up!

00:57:27.159 --> 00:57:30.930
MATT: So, just to let you guys know, we have a
guest joining us this evening. The illustrious and

00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:32.769
talented Jason Charles Miller, who is an--

00:57:32.769 --> 00:57:34.041
SAM: Where is he going?

00:57:34.041 --> 00:57:36.216
MATT: Between you guys right there. Yeah, there
you go.

00:57:36.216 --> 00:57:38.670
MARISHA: Come squeeze.

00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:41.171
MATT: Jason is going to join us for this evening
of gameplay.

00:57:41.171 --> 00:57:44.344
JASON: My first action will require me to get up,
so.

00:57:44.344 --> 00:57:50.335
MATT: Okay, well, get low for a moment, so I can
introduce you. So you can say hey! This is Jason.

00:57:50.335 --> 00:57:56.207
Jason is a voice actor, actually the voice of
Drizzt Do'Urden right now, if you know who--

00:57:56.207 --> 00:57:58.978
MARISHA: Oh, shut the fuck up! I didn't know
that!

00:57:58.978 --> 00:58:03.804
MATT: Yeah, so that's pretty awesome. As well as
the writer of our theme song, our Critical Role

00:58:03.804 --> 00:58:07.682
theme song, which we are working on a new intro
right now. And in the near future we will have that for

00:58:07.682 --> 00:58:08.970
you guys.

00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:11.578
MARISHA: You can download it on iTunes.

00:58:11.578 --> 00:58:14.600
MATT: Yes, you can. We will have that coming out
soon but yes, so Jason, thanks for joining us

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:15.883
tonight.

00:58:15.883 --> 00:58:17.371
JASON: Sure, thanks for having me.

00:58:17.371 --> 00:58:18.318
MARISHA: Hi, Jason.

00:58:18.318 --> 00:58:22.154
MATT: We'll give you the full, whole-- at end the
show, but nonetheless the half-orc approaches,

00:58:22.154 --> 00:58:24.781
lowers his hood.

00:58:24.781 --> 00:58:33.250
JASON: Okay, so I actually start speaking in
Thieves' Cant to Vex here, so I've got to whisper

00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:34.167
something.

00:58:34.167 --> 00:58:36.109
MATT: Okay, go for it. So as the orc lowers his
hood, he begins to--

00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:38.172
MARISHA: Why don't you make him come over here?

00:58:38.172 --> 00:58:39.068
LAURA: Who are you talking about?

00:58:39.068 --> 00:58:43.096
JASON: Vax, sorry, the-- The person that can speak
Thieves' Cant.

00:58:43.096 --> 00:58:44.906
LAURA: I can speak Thieves' Cant, too.

00:58:44.906 --> 00:58:46.119
JASON: But I'm talking to him.

00:58:46.119 --> 00:58:48.690
TALIESIN: Thieves can't speak. Ooh.

00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:50.419
MATT: And whispers to the two of them.

00:58:50.419 --> 00:58:52.268
MARISHA: These are tiny tables.

00:58:52.268 --> 00:58:55.994
MATT: So suddenly the orc begins to utter a series
of strange sounds like double talk and gibberish.

00:58:55.994 --> 00:58:59.836
LAURA: I'm reading his damn lips as he's doing
it.

00:58:59.836 --> 00:59:03.966
MATT: All right, and you, knowing Thieves' Cant,
pick up the details. So you can let her know as

00:59:03.966 --> 00:59:14.030
well. The rest of you see this orc speaking
nonsense and a very brief reaction from the twins.

00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:17.549
MARISHA: Look, he's been under a lot of stress,
all right?

00:59:17.549 --> 00:59:20.660
LIAM: He's trying to get us to join scientology,
that's all.

00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:21.949
(laughter)

00:59:21.949 --> 00:59:23.569
MARISHA: Our thetan levels are off the charts
right now.

00:59:23.569 --> 00:59:25.701
TALIESIN: My thetan level's at 16 right now.

00:59:25.701 --> 00:59:29.151
LAURA: You're a member of the Clasp, then?

00:59:29.151 --> 00:59:31.008
JASON: Yes.

00:59:31.008 --> 00:59:32.409
MARISHA: Oh.

00:59:32.409 --> 00:59:38.489
JASON: You're the first faces I recognize. I've
been hiding here since the attack.

00:59:38.489 --> 00:59:40.802
MARISHA: You recognized us, why? How?

00:59:40.802 --> 00:59:43.801
JASON: I'm a member of the Clasp.

00:59:43.801 --> 00:59:45.473
LIAM: Did you all make it?

00:59:45.473 --> 00:59:47.943
MARISHA: We were there recently.

00:59:47.943 --> 00:59:49.414
LIAM: What's left?

00:59:49.414 --> 00:59:56.949
JASON: I don't know. I was on a mission up above
ground when the attack happened. I'm trying

00:59:56.949 --> 01:00:03.125
desperately to get back to see who is left. My
name is Garthok.

01:00:03.125 --> 01:00:04.336
SAM: Garthok?

01:00:04.336 --> 01:00:05.386
JASON: Yes.

01:00:05.386 --> 01:00:12.298
SAM: We are Vox Machina. I am the de facto leader.
My name is Scanlan Shorthalt.

01:00:12.298 --> 01:00:18.528
JASON: I know who you are, and you are the first
people I've made myself visible to. You're the first

01:00:18.528 --> 01:00:22.893
people that I recognize or even know that I can
trust.

01:00:22.893 --> 01:00:26.524
MARISHA: Have you been through the city? How much
is left?

01:00:26.524 --> 01:00:36.244
JASON: It is not-- it's indescribable. There is
incredible destruction.

01:00:36.244 --> 01:00:39.267
MARISHA: Have you encountered any more survivors?

01:00:39.267 --> 01:00:43.721
MATT: Which you have. As you walked through the
city, you have noticed there are many survivors of

01:00:43.721 --> 01:00:49.602
the town. A lot of them have kept inside, but
there are a number that are actually running

01:00:49.602 --> 01:00:51.263
through and looting the town.

01:00:51.263 --> 01:00:52.413
LAURA: Ugh.

01:00:52.413 --> 01:00:54.215
LIAM: What was your name again?

01:00:54.215 --> 01:00:55.307
JASON: Garthok.

01:00:55.307 --> 01:00:58.921
LIAM: Garthok. What of the Spirelings? What of the
leaders of the Clasp?

01:00:58.921 --> 01:01:02.824
JASON: All I know is what I knew before the
attack.

01:01:02.824 --> 01:01:11.545
LIAM: We've come here looking for survivors. We
don't intend to stay long. You are welcome to come

01:01:11.545 --> 01:01:12.705
with us.

01:01:12.705 --> 01:01:20.688
LAURA: Are you one of the people looting? You said
you saw other people doing the same.

01:01:20.688 --> 01:01:30.718
JASON: I'm not a looter. I was on a classified
mission above ground, and now that's all gone to

01:01:30.718 --> 01:01:34.533
shit basically, so I'm trying to get back to our
headquarters.

01:01:34.533 --> 01:01:40.573
SAM: Garthok, are you familiar with tunnels or
secret passageways around the city at all?

01:01:40.573 --> 01:01:44.198
JASON: You could say yes. Absolutely.

01:01:44.198 --> 01:01:45.925
SAM: Are we near any?

01:01:45.925 --> 01:01:48.612
LAURA: We need to get across town and not be
seen.

01:01:48.612 --> 01:01:50.865
MARISHA: We are trying to get to the Abdar's
Promenade.

01:01:50.865 --> 01:01:53.496
LIAM: Wait, show me your brand.

01:01:53.496 --> 01:01:59.522
MATT: He reveals the back of the cloak and you do
indeed see the brand of the Clasp. The same one

01:01:59.522 --> 01:02:01.924
you carry between the shoulder blades.

01:02:01.924 --> 01:02:05.419
MARISHA: Do you know each other?

01:02:05.419 --> 01:02:09.167
(laughter)

01:02:09.167 --> 01:02:10.890
LIAM: It's a pretty big organization.

01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:16.316
MATT: There are certain tunnels that traverse
underneath Emon, specifically amongst the Clasp.

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:23.929
However, two of the locations to the south of the
city, one in the Graveyard District and one in the

01:02:23.929 --> 01:02:30.122
Temple District, which you guys are adjacent to
right now, those are the two that immediately come

01:02:30.122 --> 01:02:36.681
to mind. The Temple one that you are nearby
seeking has been completely demolished and is

01:02:36.681 --> 01:02:41.014
unusable. There's one to the Graveyard District.
There's one north of Abdar's Promenade that could

01:02:41.014 --> 01:02:48.522
possibly be of use to you. Those are the only ones
that come to mind that are nearby.

01:02:48.522 --> 01:02:55.809
TALIESIN: Well, if we're heading that way anyway.
We stop by Gilmore's and we do need to check in

01:02:55.809 --> 01:02:57.625
with the Clasp, anyway.

01:02:57.625 --> 01:02:59.219
LIAM: Maybe.

01:02:59.219 --> 01:03:01.490
TALIESIN: They're going to be helpful.

01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:02.686
LIAM: Maybe.

01:03:02.686 --> 01:03:04.068
TRAVIS: Are we out in the open right now?

01:03:04.068 --> 01:03:05.703
MATT: You are out in the open right now.

01:03:05.703 --> 01:03:11.446
TRAVIS: Can we fucking get inside, please?

01:03:11.446 --> 01:03:17.051
LIAM: We need to get to Gilmore's Glorious Goods.
Do you know where that is?

01:03:17.051 --> 01:03:18.806
JASON: Yes, I can lead you there.

01:03:18.806 --> 01:03:20.305
LIAM: Underground?

01:03:20.305 --> 01:03:23.655
JASON: I could, if the temple entrance wasn't
destroyed.

01:03:23.655 --> 01:03:25.384
MARISHA: I might be able to clear it out.

01:03:25.384 --> 01:03:28.106
TRAVIS: You want to walk towards the temple?

01:03:28.106 --> 01:03:30.277
SAM: We're near the Temple District now.

01:03:30.277 --> 01:03:32.695
MARISHA: We can take the tunnels under--

01:03:32.695 --> 01:03:37.205
SAM: But if the entrance to the tunnel was
destroyed, it's best not to risk it. Let's keep going.

01:03:37.205 --> 01:03:38.868
LAURA: And we'll make a lot of noise clearing it
out.

01:03:38.868 --> 01:03:40.073
TALIESIN: That's true.

01:03:40.073 --> 01:03:41.363
LAURA: Best to skirt.

01:03:41.363 --> 01:03:42.825
LIAM: Building to building.

01:03:42.825 --> 01:03:45.285
SAM: Are you okay with stealth?

01:03:45.285 --> 01:03:51.303
MARISHA: I might be able to tunnel us to the
closest tunnel system, from right here.

01:03:51.303 --> 01:03:56.301
LAURA: Do it then.

01:03:56.301 --> 01:04:00.413
MATT: How do you intend to do this?

01:04:00.413 --> 01:04:04.886
MARISHA: Move Earth. Sixth level.

01:04:04.886 --> 01:04:07.823
LAURA: Whoa, you're using a 6th-level spell right
now?

01:04:07.823 --> 01:04:10.436
MARISHA: Do we want to do it now?

01:04:10.436 --> 01:04:12.968
SAM: We're not near the entrance to the
tunnel right now.

01:04:12.968 --> 01:04:16.732
LAURA: No, let's just stealth it. Yeah, save
that.

01:04:16.732 --> 01:04:18.559
TALIESIN: We can save that for an emergency.

01:04:18.559 --> 01:04:19.734
MARISHA: I'll save it.

01:04:19.734 --> 01:04:24.572
MATT: Okay. It will take you, at the rate at which
it moves earth, it will take you probably a good

01:04:24.572 --> 01:04:26.190
hour to two hours to--

01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:27.398
MARISHA: To get to the tunnels?

01:04:27.398 --> 01:04:29.097
MATT: To get to any sort of system that he may be
referring to.

01:04:29.097 --> 01:04:31.064
MARISHA: All right, let's just walk. We'll walk
faster.

01:04:31.064 --> 01:04:37.147
MATT: All right, so, Garthok, I'm going to have
you roll a stealth check to move alongside the

01:04:37.147 --> 01:04:38.367
rest of the group.

01:04:38.367 --> 01:04:48.653
JASON: Great. 25.

01:04:48.653 --> 01:04:52.255
MARISHA: Does he benefit from Pass Without a
Trace?

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:57.926
MATT: No, he arrived after the spell was cast, but
as you guys move forward, he also dives into the

01:04:57.926 --> 01:05:03.810
shadows in a very similar way that you've seen Vax
do before. This orc definitely understands the

01:05:03.810 --> 01:05:06.969
resources of light and the absence of it.

01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:09.522
TALIESIN: He's played some Assassin's Creed.

01:05:09.522 --> 01:05:14.147
MATT: (laughs) He's hitting you all up in the
shoulders for change. All right, so--

01:05:14.147 --> 01:05:15.416
LIAM: Is that a dice game?

01:05:15.416 --> 01:05:18.879
TALIESIN: It's a band, they're very good.

01:05:18.879 --> 01:05:27.562
MATT: So, as you guys push forward, staying
towards the outskirts of the city, you do come

01:05:27.562 --> 01:05:33.825
across, on the outer area of the Temple District,
a humble neighborhood that has been completely

01:05:33.825 --> 01:05:40.526
reduced to cinders and ash. There is probably a
good eight to ten buildings that are piles of

01:05:40.526 --> 01:05:48.491
black, still burning wood, dust, and broken stone.
You can see on the outskirts of some of these

01:05:48.491 --> 01:05:54.663
piles of rubble, bodies lying in the street, the
skin charred black and cracked as the face and

01:05:54.663 --> 01:06:01.195
arms are curled up in the final moments of
agony. You avert your gaze and continue pressing

01:06:01.195 --> 01:06:06.973
onward and you can see now, many of these large
temples in the center of the city, you can see

01:06:06.973 --> 01:06:11.545
folks gathered to them and clustered on the
inside, you can hear people shouting and folks

01:06:11.545 --> 01:06:20.314
trying to deal with this current circumstance
befalling the town. You continue to move out of

01:06:20.314 --> 01:06:25.685
the sight of those clusters of survivors that are
going to their various deities for aid and

01:06:25.685 --> 01:06:31.144
comfort. You push further towards the center of
the Temple District. You do catch out of the left

01:06:31.144 --> 01:06:37.729
the sound of breaking glass, specifically to you,
Vex, in the distance. As you glance over and look,

01:06:37.729 --> 01:06:42.824
you can see four individuals climb out of a window
with sacks over their shoulders. They all gesture

01:06:42.824 --> 01:06:47.877
to each other and go running off northward,
deeper into the city, carrying whatever goods they

01:06:47.877 --> 01:06:54.627
managed to acquire from the interior. And as you
progress, you do notice a lot of windows have been

01:06:54.627 --> 01:06:59.948
broken. You don't know if from the inside or
outside. Some may have been from the impact of the

01:06:59.948 --> 01:07:02.922
attack, some may have been from individuals that
have been moving from building to building. It's

01:07:02.922 --> 01:07:10.293
hard to say at this point, there's such disarray
around you. As you skirt along the very far end of

01:07:10.293 --> 01:07:17.255
the Temple District, you see a portion of the
neighborhood now is in itself encased in ice, like

01:07:17.255 --> 01:07:24.907
the individuals you saw at the south gate. This is
another area where Vorugal made its way through,

01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:32.684
and you can see another array of icy coffins of
other individuals who were trying to escape but

01:07:32.684 --> 01:07:40.500
were locked in place. You can see a small group of
living Emon residents that are currently gathering

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:45.422
the dead and trying to take them out of the open
and possibly give them a proper burial, whether it be

01:07:45.422 --> 01:07:51.338
people they know or not, but there is a look on
each of their faces of desolate acceptance of what

01:07:51.338 --> 01:07:53.873
is happening and trying to process this--

01:07:53.873 --> 01:08:02.352
TRAVIS: Can I slink back to Vax? And I say: you
still think that what was inside that skull is worse

01:08:02.352 --> 01:08:07.381
than all of this?

01:08:07.381 --> 01:08:15.749
LIAM: I think it is probably equal to this. We've
been burned before, Grog. This was going to happen

01:08:15.749 --> 01:08:18.295
whether we wanted it to or not.

01:08:18.295 --> 01:08:25.200
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we could have done something
about it. I walk on.

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.513
MATT: Okay.

01:08:26.513 --> 01:08:28.853
LIAM: Big if, big man.

01:08:28.853 --> 01:08:35.146
MATT: The clouds are beginning to gather up over
the sky as you continue forward and the little bit

01:08:35.146 --> 01:08:41.761
of sunshine that came through this morning is now
covered in coming rain clouds. Which may be a boon

01:08:41.761 --> 01:08:47.322
to those buildings that still burn and possibly an
annoyance to a giant, fire-based red dragon in the

01:08:47.322 --> 01:08:53.731
center of the city but, nevertheless, the weather is quickly
shifting. As you begin pushing into Abdar's

01:08:53.731 --> 01:09:01.665
Promenade, you can see the central bazaar before
you, the memory of it, this sprawling landscape of

01:09:01.665 --> 01:09:10.560
multicolored tents and carts and what was this
bustling marketplace is all closed down and a

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:16.094
portion of it appears to have been torn through.
You can see broken bits of wood and wagon wheels

01:09:16.094 --> 01:09:20.074
tossed asunder like, apparently, one of these
dragons may have smashed into the center and let

01:09:20.074 --> 01:09:29.032
loose its fury. You can see spatters of blood
across elements of the ground, but no sign of a

01:09:29.032 --> 01:09:34.743
body, as there are a few groups going around,
trying to gather what they can, but the place is

01:09:34.743 --> 01:09:43.015
also picked clean. You notice a lot of these tents
and carts are empty of any real valuables. You are

01:09:43.015 --> 01:09:48.294
uncertain whether or not the proprietors took it
themselves or they have been picked clean by looters.

01:09:48.294 --> 01:09:50.916
LAURA: Scavengers.

01:09:50.916 --> 01:09:58.690
MATT: You begin to approach, with a very, very
nervous heart, the corner of the bazaar that leads

01:09:58.690 --> 01:10:05.998
to Gilmore's place. As you approach, the
nervousness is met with the visual of a large

01:10:05.998 --> 01:10:14.369
stack of black smoke that rises from that
direction. As you push through with increased

01:10:14.369 --> 01:10:23.216
haste towards that area of the bazaar, you see
Gilmore's Glorious Goods, as well as two other

01:10:23.216 --> 01:10:31.158
adjacent buildings, completely destroyed. Piles of
rubble and what looks to be a group of about ten

01:10:31.158 --> 01:10:35.935
individuals that are currently picking through the
rubble and gathering what they can, moving over

01:10:35.935 --> 01:10:37.787
wood and brick.

01:10:37.787 --> 01:10:41.975
LIAM: I stop stealthing and walk right into it and
start shouting, (shouting) get the fuck out of

01:10:41.975 --> 01:10:44.142
here! Get out!

01:10:44.142 --> 01:10:49.335
MATT: As you do that, all of them turn over, looks
and one says, "Hey, get your own shit, all right?"

01:10:49.335 --> 01:10:53.656
LIAM: Move on now! Now! Now!

01:10:53.656 --> 01:10:57.934
MATT: He stops and looks about the other one. The
other guys looking over their shoulders and,

01:10:57.934 --> 01:11:00.421
"Look, we're all just trying to stay alive here,
okay?"

01:11:00.421 --> 01:11:02.253
TALIESIN: I pull out my gun. You heard the man.

01:11:02.253 --> 01:11:03.728
TRAVIS: Yeah, big sword comes out, too.

01:11:03.728 --> 01:11:05.331
MARISHA: Fire hands.

01:11:05.331 --> 01:11:07.459
LAURA: Don't test us.

01:11:07.459 --> 01:11:10.416
MARISHA: We've had a really shitty day.

01:11:10.416 --> 01:11:12.954
MATT: "You've had a shitty day?"

01:11:12.954 --> 01:11:15.791
MARISHA: We've all had a shitty day

01:11:15.791 --> 01:11:19.440
MATT: "Well, let's make it all sorts more shitty,"
And he pulls a shortsword from his side and all

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:24.662
the rest of them pull their blades out and they
say, "Look, we saw this first. We're going to

01:11:24.662 --> 01:11:26.721
"bring it to him and save ourselves."

01:11:26.721 --> 01:11:28.616
LIAM: I'll fucking gut you like a fish--

01:11:28.616 --> 01:11:29.492
LAURA: Stop!

01:11:29.492 --> 01:11:30.601
LIAM: --and take your innards--

01:11:30.601 --> 01:11:31.386
LAURA: Stop!

01:11:31.386 --> 01:11:32.751
LIAM: -- out your mouth. I will not!

01:11:32.751 --> 01:11:34.626
LAURA: Stop. You will take it to him?

01:11:34.626 --> 01:11:35.700
MARISHA: Who's him?

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:36.975
LAURA: Thordak?

01:11:36.975 --> 01:11:43.410
MATT: They all, with their weapons out, tense
their shoulders and say, "There's only one way we

01:11:43.410 --> 01:11:44.876
"are going to survive this."

01:11:44.876 --> 01:11:53.859
LAURA: Listen. There's so much more available to
you, buildings up that way. Not worth your time

01:11:53.859 --> 01:11:55.089
right here.

01:11:55.089 --> 01:11:59.403
MATT: (laughs) "Honey, we've already picked plenty
clean from this pile. This is our third time back."

01:11:59.403 --> 01:12:02.237
TRAVIS: It'll be your last time back if you're not
careful.

01:12:02.237 --> 01:12:07.446
LAURA: Is it worth your death? Bringing this to
him, is it worth your death? Because you will die here.

01:12:07.446 --> 01:12:11.420
MATT: "You know what, I think I stand a better
chance against the lot of you than with that thing."

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:13.599
MARISHA: You just thought wrong.

01:12:13.599 --> 01:12:18.929
LAURA: Step on and go find loot somewhere else. At
least then you can present it to him and not die

01:12:18.929 --> 01:12:21.027
here. Don't be stupid.

01:12:21.027 --> 01:12:22.328
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:12:22.328 --> 01:12:24.044
TRAVIS: Vex, please let me off the chain.

01:12:24.044 --> 01:12:29.163
LAURA: Ugh, I rolled so poorly. Anybody want to
assist me?

01:12:29.163 --> 01:12:30.815
MATT: It's a little late for that.

01:12:30.815 --> 01:12:33.944
LAURA: (sings) How about ten?

01:12:33.944 --> 01:12:43.612
MATT: Okay. You can see as he's holding his
shortsword to the side, goes, "You know, you may

01:12:43.612 --> 01:12:49.723
"be stupid, but there are other stupid things in
this town, like walking in the middle of an

01:12:49.723 --> 01:12:51.038
"ambush, dear."

01:12:51.038 --> 01:12:54.248
At which point, a dagger comes past--

01:12:54.248 --> 01:12:55.994
LAURA: I've got passive perception!

01:12:55.994 --> 01:12:56.899
MATT: I know.

01:12:56.899 --> 01:12:58.852
LAURA: Motherfuck!

01:12:58.852 --> 01:13:04.851
MATT: You instinctually move your head out the way
as it (whoosh) past you as you see another

01:13:04.851 --> 01:13:09.427
individual that was keeping low to the rubble
flung a dagger at you, and the rest of them pull

01:13:09.427 --> 01:13:12.967
their weapons ready and are about to enter a fray.
I need everyone to roll initiative.

01:13:12.967 --> 01:13:15.053
MARISHA: Fuck these assholes!

01:13:15.053 --> 01:13:17.161
TALIESIN: This is everything I wanted.

01:13:17.161 --> 01:13:18.527
LAURA: Natural fucking 20.

01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:21.688
MARISHA: Therapeutic ass-kicking. That's pretty
good.

01:13:21.688 --> 01:13:23.181
SAM: They may win.

01:13:23.181 --> 01:13:27.259
MARISHA: Nah. Fuck that. We're way more pissed
off--

01:13:27.259 --> 01:13:28.784
SAM: They work for a dragon.

01:13:28.784 --> 01:13:32.955
LAURA: Do they? They're just looters.

01:13:32.955 --> 01:13:35.471
TALIESIN: This is going to feel really good.

01:13:35.471 --> 01:13:36.521
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:13:36.521 --> 01:13:38.292
SAM: But they're innocent.

01:13:38.292 --> 01:13:41.409
MARISHA: Yeah, we're not going to kill them. We'll
just beat their faces in.

01:13:41.409 --> 01:13:45.819
LAURA: Garthok, did you lead us here? Did you know
about this?

01:13:45.819 --> 01:13:47.174
JASON: No.

01:13:47.174 --> 01:13:48.608
SAM: I believe him.

01:13:48.608 --> 01:13:50.899
MARISHA: Insight check. Can I insight check him?

01:13:50.899 --> 01:13:55.629
TALIESIN: We literally just walked to where we
were going. He lead us precisely where we wanted

01:13:55.629 --> 01:13:58.951
to go. There's nothing clever about that trap.

01:13:58.951 --> 01:14:04.199
MATT: All right, so, placement, guys. Where would
you like to be on this one?

01:14:04.199 --> 01:14:11.612
TALIESIN: I suppose we'd be hanging back a bit.
Well, you got up in their face, so you're--

01:14:11.612 --> 01:14:13.251
MARISHA: The three of us got up in their face.

01:14:13.251 --> 01:14:14.559
TRAVIS: I was walking with Vax.

01:14:14.559 --> 01:14:16.565
TALIESIN: I was hanging back a bit.

01:14:16.565 --> 01:14:18.890
MARISHA: I think Scanlan and Pike were towards the
back.

01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:22.584
I'm next to Percy.

01:14:22.584 --> 01:14:27.134
MATT: And Vex, you're up here?

01:14:27.134 --> 01:14:28.618
LAURA: Sure, why not.

01:14:28.618 --> 01:14:30.188
MATT: You were up in their face right here.

01:14:30.188 --> 01:14:32.296
LAURA: In his face and I have Trinket on my back.

01:14:32.296 --> 01:14:34.329
SAM: Which one is Jason Charles Miller?

01:14:34.329 --> 01:14:36.926
MATT: Jason is--

01:14:36.926 --> 01:14:39.060
TALIESIN: Gart-Garthluk.

01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:40.367
JASON: Garthok.

01:14:40.367 --> 01:14:43.069
TALIESIN: Garthok, Garthok, I'm close. I'm getting
it, Garthok.

01:14:43.069 --> 01:14:48.083
MATT: Garthok, where do you want to be?

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:51.452
JASON: I'm ready to tangle.

01:14:51.452 --> 01:14:56.518
MATT: All right, we'll put you over here, in the
middle of the group being watched. The rest of

01:14:56.518 --> 01:15:00.752
these thugs are all currently sitting over in this
rubble.

01:15:00.752 --> 01:15:06.386
MARISHA: What do you think, Garthok? I don't know,
what do you think, Waynethok?

01:15:06.386 --> 01:15:10.631
JASON: (laughs) Party on, Garthok. Party on,
Waynethok.

01:15:10.631 --> 01:15:14.148
(laughter)

01:15:14.148 --> 01:15:24.529
MATT: All right. So, I would like--

01:15:24.529 --> 01:15:29.041
SAM: Should we be at all concerned about drawing
attention to ourselves?

01:15:29.041 --> 01:15:30.579
LAURA: Too late for that.

01:15:30.579 --> 01:15:33.027
SAM: No, I mean, like, giant Fireballs or
anything?

01:15:33.027 --> 01:15:35.530
LAURA: Probably stay away from huge magical
effects.

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:39.492
LIAM: Fireball straight into the sky!

01:15:39.492 --> 01:15:47.580
MATT: Yeah, there you go, that'd be perfect. All
right, so, initiatives 25 to 20 or higher?

01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:49.378
LAURA: 27. Natural 20.

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.161
SAM: Natural 27.

01:15:51.161 --> 01:15:52.979
TALIESIN: 25.

01:15:52.979 --> 01:15:57.904
MATT: Percy. 20 to 15?

01:15:57.904 --> 01:15:59.457
MARISHA: 17.

01:15:59.457 --> 01:16:07.313
MATT: Keyleth. All right, 15 to ten? What do we
got?

01:16:07.313 --> 01:16:08.334
JASON: 14.

01:16:08.334 --> 01:16:09.177
SAM: 12.

01:16:09.177 --> 01:16:09.997
LIAM: 12.

01:16:09.997 --> 01:16:10.999
TRAVIS: 14.

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:12.254
MATT: All right, so we got--

01:16:12.254 --> 01:16:13.781
TRAVIS: Two 12s and two 14s.

01:16:13.781 --> 01:16:25.565
MATT: And then 12 and 12. All righty. And is Pike
not able to--

01:16:25.565 --> 01:16:27.526
LIAM: I'll try!

01:16:27.526 --> 01:16:30.365
LAURA: Pike lost completely all connection.

01:16:30.365 --> 01:16:31.966
SAM: Pike fell down in some rubble.

01:16:31.966 --> 01:16:36.079
MATT: I'll roll for her. (laughs) Pike's going
last. I figure she probably would have rolled last

01:16:36.079 --> 01:16:37.767
anyways, so Pike is last.

01:16:37.767 --> 01:16:41.741
LAURA: Yeah, I think she said she was probably
going to have to leave until the break until we

01:16:41.741 --> 01:16:43.135
can figure out the tech.

01:16:43.135 --> 01:16:46.855
MATT: Gotcha! Okay, no worries. Top of the round.
Vex, since you are the one who got the first

01:16:46.855 --> 01:16:49.324
attack and immediately reacting to it. You're up.
What are you doing?

01:16:49.324 --> 01:16:53.777
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on
that motherfucker in front of me. And then I'm

01:16:53.777 --> 01:17:01.858
going to cast Conjure Barrage at all of them in
front of me, like a big cone effect.

01:17:01.858 --> 01:17:08.797
MATT: Okay. Okay, so, Conjure Barrage is your
action, so that's your full thing. So, at which

01:17:08.797 --> 01:17:09.888
direction are you doing it?

01:17:09.888 --> 01:17:14.502
LAURA: Just towards all the guys in front of me. I
want to get as many in the cone as I can.

01:17:14.502 --> 01:17:17.800
MATT: Okay, you probably need to move this way or
else you're going to hit your brother as well.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.013
LAURA: Oh, that's my brother.

01:17:19.013 --> 01:17:19.988
MATT: That's your brother right there.

01:17:19.988 --> 01:17:22.731
LAURA: I can see what's happening now. Yeah, I
move over then I--

01:17:22.731 --> 01:17:23.891
MATT: That's a 60 foot?

01:17:23.891 --> 01:17:25.791
LAURA: It's a 60-foot cone.

01:17:25.791 --> 01:17:31.683
MATT: Yeah, right there. So all four of them are
affected. Great.

01:17:31.683 --> 01:17:35.142
LAURA: Great. So, Trinket is still on my back.
He's a red panda.

01:17:35.142 --> 01:17:39.223
MATT: Yeah. Until she breaks concentration.

01:17:39.223 --> 01:17:47.611
LAURA: I fire it and I shoot forward and that's
it, huh? I don't have to, like--

01:17:47.611 --> 01:17:51.363
MATT: Conjure Barrage, you roll damage and they
get to save.

01:17:51.363 --> 01:17:58.506
LAURA: Okay, cool. So I'm going to cast that at--
oh, it's already at third level, okay.

01:17:58.506 --> 01:17:59.749
MATT: Yeah.

01:17:59.749 --> 01:18:09.410
LAURA: Whoa. 15? And then I add my type anything?
Or it's just 15.

01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:16.926
MATT: It's just 15, and then you add 1d6 for the
one dude for Hunter's Mark.

01:18:16.926 --> 01:18:20.215
LAURA: For my Hunter's Mark. Do I add my Bracers
of Archery, though, on that?

01:18:20.215 --> 01:18:27.379
MATT: Technically-- You know what, sure. Because
it is technically a ranged attack. I'll let it

01:18:27.379 --> 01:18:28.670
happen, sure.

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:30.686
LAURA: 17 and an additional six on--

01:18:30.686 --> 01:18:32.994
MATT: On that guy? Okay, what's your DC of your
spells?

01:18:32.994 --> 01:18:34.852
LAURA: 15.

01:18:34.852 --> 01:18:36.331
MATT: Okay.

01:18:36.331 --> 01:18:38.963
LAURA: Do I add my spell attack bonus?

01:18:38.963 --> 01:18:43.559
MATT: You don't have to roll to attack. This just
happens and they have to try and save to get out

01:18:43.559 --> 01:18:44.606
of the way.

01:18:44.606 --> 01:18:45.720
LAURA: I understand.

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:48.957
MATT: Cool. All right so, that's 17 damage to--
those two take half there.

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:50.375
LAURA: I don't understand.

01:18:50.375 --> 01:18:52.998
LIAM: It will sink in in a few episodes. It's fine.

01:18:52.998 --> 01:19:01.280
MATT: All right. Cool. All right so, as you
release this spraying torrent of arrows down the

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:07.707
way. It fires outward. All of them all of a sudden
have to put their arms up to instinctually defend

01:19:07.707 --> 01:19:12.215
themselves with arrows piercing bits of their
armor and ricochet off. It's not horribly

01:19:12.215 --> 01:19:16.346
damaging, but enough to sweep into all of them and
they all immediately look up angrily at each other,

01:19:16.346 --> 01:19:19.317
weapons at the ready to go ahead and
get vengeance.

01:19:19.317 --> 01:19:21.644
LAURA: I take the rest of my moment to back up
against a wall.

01:19:21.644 --> 01:19:26.124
MATT: Okay. Right there. All righty, Percy, you're
up next.

01:19:26.124 --> 01:19:33.930
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to Hex the one that
she Hunter's Marked.

01:19:33.930 --> 01:19:35.816
MATT: Oh man.

01:19:35.816 --> 01:19:37.577
LAURA: Fuck that guy.

01:19:37.577 --> 01:19:39.707
MATT: All righty.

01:19:39.707 --> 01:19:42.091
MARISHA: (laughs) Fuck that one guy in
particular.

01:19:42.091 --> 01:19:54.685
TALIESIN: And I'm going to-- Where am I? Oh, there
I am. I'm going to run towards that other wall to

01:19:54.685 --> 01:19:55.797
the left.

01:19:55.797 --> 01:19:56.679
MATT: This way?

01:19:56.679 --> 01:20:02.388
TALIESIN: Yep, all the while taking a few shots at
that bastard who I just hexed.

01:20:02.388 --> 01:20:05.596
MATT: As you are moving you're like (gunshots).
Okay. Go for it.

01:20:05.596 --> 01:20:14.229
TALIESIN: Oh, and Sharpshooter shots, because
that's funnier. So that's, ugh--

01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:16.166
MARISHA: But you're Percy.

01:20:16.166 --> 01:20:22.577
TALIESIN: Yeah, so that's not-- That's 14 to hit.

01:20:22.577 --> 01:20:26.186
MATT: 14 hits.

01:20:26.186 --> 01:20:27.879
TALIESIN: Should I just roll all three shots?

01:20:27.879 --> 01:20:29.787
MATT: Yeah, roll three shots.

01:20:29.787 --> 01:20:32.572
TALIESIN: That's 20. That hits.

01:20:32.572 --> 01:20:34.282
MATT: That hits.

01:20:34.282 --> 01:20:36.961
TALIESIN: And 18. That hits.

01:20:36.961 --> 01:20:44.123
MATT: Yeah, so go ahead and roll damage for all
three shots, and an additional 1d6 to each shot.

01:20:44.123 --> 01:20:57.941
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. That's ten, 26, 27 points. 26
points plus one necrotic. That's on the other end

01:20:57.941 --> 01:20:58.935
of things.

01:20:58.935 --> 01:21:01.610
MARISHA: The opposite! (laughs) The exact
opposite.

01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:05.990
TALIESIN: Irony. 17 points plus six
necrotic.

01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.997
MATT: All righty.

01:21:06.997 --> 01:21:16.641
TALIESIN: And for my final roll. 17, 18, 19, 20,
25 points plus six necrotic.

01:21:16.641 --> 01:21:18.509
MARISHA: That guy is dead, right?

01:21:18.509 --> 01:21:26.869
MATT: All right so, as you go running by
(gunshots) each shot as it impacts, the guy who's

01:21:26.869 --> 01:21:32.037
already dealing with the array of arrows in his
chest, each shot that blows across his shoulders

01:21:32.037 --> 01:21:38.348
is followed by a plume of black-purple smoke that
blasts off each impact until it leaves a hole off

01:21:38.348 --> 01:21:44.525
this shoulder. This actually blows this arm off
from the impact. And the third one just destroys

01:21:44.525 --> 01:21:47.176
the upper part of his head and he slinks back onto
the rubble.

01:21:47.176 --> 01:21:51.285
TALIESIN: I move my Hex to the next guy and point
at him as I'm running.

01:21:51.285 --> 01:21:53.971
LAURA: I move my Hunter's Mark to the next guy
because the other one went to zero.

01:21:53.971 --> 01:21:55.576
TRAVIS: That's some Hateful Eight shit right
there.

01:21:55.576 --> 01:22:02.297
MATT: (laughs) All right, you have to use a
bonus action to mark a new creature. Both you guys do.

01:22:02.297 --> 01:22:03.387
LAURA: Oh.

01:22:03.387 --> 01:22:07.428
MATT: So those will be-- Those move over when--
(gunshot impact) He is blown off the map

01:22:07.428 --> 01:22:08.699
essentially.

01:22:08.699 --> 01:22:11.795
LAURA: It said when it went down to zero, I could
move it to the next person.

01:22:11.795 --> 01:22:15.128
MATT: If the target drops to zero hit
points, you can use a bonus action on subsequent

01:22:15.128 --> 01:22:16.665
turns of yours to mark a new creature.

01:22:16.665 --> 01:22:17.790
LAURA: I understand.

01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:19.040
MATT: I know.

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.667
LIAM: There's so many rules, guys!

01:22:20.667 --> 01:22:27.440
MATT: All right, it's their turn now. So, out the
side, after that final shot, you hear a little

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:34.489
guttural grunt off to your left as you see this
dwarf with a giant hammer come rushing up. "You!

01:22:34.489 --> 01:22:40.894
"How dare you!" And comes swinging off towards your
direction there, off to the side. These guys here

01:22:40.894 --> 01:22:47.172
are going to move in. Both of these are going to
run up to Grog, being the larger there.

01:22:47.172 --> 01:22:49.594
TRAVIS: Just signed your death certificate.

01:22:49.594 --> 01:22:52.638
MATT: That guy comes up to Keyleth. These two come
rushing around.

01:22:52.638 --> 01:22:54.559
LAURA: Oh shit, there's two more?

01:22:54.559 --> 01:22:55.524
MATT: Yep.

01:22:55.524 --> 01:22:56.844
LAURA: I didn't see those guys.

01:22:56.844 --> 01:22:57.973
MATT: No, you didn't.

01:22:57.973 --> 01:23:00.272
LAURA: I saw one of them, but I didn't see all of
them.

01:23:00.272 --> 01:23:02.912
MATT: That guy can only get that far, so he's
going to go ahead and throw. All right, so--

01:23:02.912 --> 01:23:04.636
LAURA: They're going to get sneak attacks on me.

01:23:04.636 --> 01:23:09.373
MATT: Indeed. All right, so, first and foremost,
the dwarf comes up against you, Percy. That's

01:23:09.373 --> 01:23:13.142
going to be an 18 to hit.

01:23:13.142 --> 01:23:15.197
TALIESIN: My armor class is 18.

01:23:15.197 --> 01:23:20.912
MATT: So it hits, yeah. And it's going to hit you
again this time. That's going to be 15, so only--

01:23:20.912 --> 01:23:28.229
TALIESIN: I was about to say, can I take that first
18 and make it-- nah, you know what, I'll take the

01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:29.886
hit, never mind.

01:23:29.886 --> 01:23:33.242
MATT: Okay. You take eight points of bludgeoning
damage from the smack of the mace.

01:23:33.242 --> 01:23:37.834
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:23:37.834 --> 01:23:38.968
MATT: All right.

01:23:38.968 --> 01:23:40.674
LIAM: Slap-a the mace.

01:23:40.674 --> 01:23:49.379
MATT: Two guys against Grog now, their maces out
as well. Because they have pack tactics, they both

01:23:49.379 --> 01:23:55.795
have advantage on attacks against you. So with
that, that's a 19.

01:23:55.795 --> 01:23:57.198
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:59.688
MATT: Hits. And the other one, with advantage, is
a natural 20.

01:23:59.688 --> 01:24:01.118
MARISHA: Ouch.

01:24:01.118 --> 01:24:08.922
MATT: You're not raging yet, so you take full
damage. All right, ten points of bludgeoning

01:24:08.922 --> 01:24:16.997
damage on the first hit. And the second one,
that's going to be 15 points of bludgeoning

01:24:16.997 --> 01:24:21.301
damage. So a total of 25 points of bludgeoning
damage as both of them whack you with maces from

01:24:21.301 --> 01:24:26.492
each side, with the first round of attacks. Now
the second round of attacks, because they attack twice.

01:24:26.492 --> 01:24:27.911
LAURA: Ugh.

01:24:27.911 --> 01:24:30.895
MATT: With advantage. That's a 21, which hits.

01:24:30.895 --> 01:24:31.940
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:33.919
MATT: And a 15.

01:24:33.919 --> 01:24:34.828
TRAVIS: Nope.

01:24:34.828 --> 01:24:38.231
MATT: So you then take seven points of bludgeoning
damage after that.

01:24:38.231 --> 01:24:39.193
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:24:39.193 --> 01:24:45.757
MATT: Cool. So that's two. There's one against
you, Vax. He doesn't get advantage against you. He

01:24:45.757 --> 01:24:47.003
rolls a 17.

01:24:47.003 --> 01:24:53.428
LIAM: I'm going to use Uncanny Dodge-- No! It
doesn't hit because I've got both daggers out.

01:24:53.428 --> 01:24:55.801
MATT: Oh yeah, because you get bonus AC.

01:24:55.801 --> 01:24:59.427
LIAM: I have three armor classes depending on if
my boots are on or my daggers are in my hands.

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:06.453
MATT: Right. Okay, cool. Good to know. All right,
so then leading up to that, there's one against

01:25:06.453 --> 01:25:07.712
you, Keyleth.

01:25:07.712 --> 01:25:08.985
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:25:08.985 --> 01:25:19.351
MATT: That's going to be a 14 and a natural 20.
That is going to be 15 points of bludgeoning

01:25:19.351 --> 01:25:20.609
damage against you.

01:25:20.609 --> 01:25:21.639
MARISHA: All right.

01:25:21.639 --> 01:25:25.468
MATT: Whack! As the mace swings past and catches
you right across the chin, the impact causes your

01:25:25.468 --> 01:25:29.313
head to snap for a second. A very minor moment of
whiplash, as you look back and feel the blood

01:25:29.313 --> 01:25:30.665
trickling down.

01:25:30.665 --> 01:25:32.880
MARISHA: Ah!

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:40.300
MATT: Yeah, and then there's two against you, Vex.
Which both get advantage because of pack tactics.

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:55.751
13, even with advantage. The second attack is 23,
and the other one does two attacks, 22 and 17.

01:25:55.751 --> 01:25:59.418
17 doesn't hit? Okay, so that's three attacks on
you that hit.

01:25:59.418 --> 01:26:00.681
LAURA: No, two attacks hit.

01:26:00.681 --> 01:26:10.074
MATT: Oh, two attacks. You take nine points of
bludgeoning damage and six points of bludgeoning

01:26:10.074 --> 01:26:11.162
damage.

01:26:11.162 --> 01:26:12.408
LAURA: Okay!

01:26:12.408 --> 01:26:17.289
MATT: And the one that's over here, there's nobody 
immediately around for it pull its mace out. Instead,

01:26:17.289 --> 01:26:21.624
he pulls out his heavy crossbow, lines up, and
aims at you, Scanlan.

01:26:21.624 --> 01:26:23.350
SAM: Oh, what? Who, me?

01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:24.266
MATT: Yep.

01:26:24.266 --> 01:26:25.622
SAM: But I'm-- Oh.

01:26:25.622 --> 01:26:28.065
MATT: And that is 21 to hit.

01:26:28.065 --> 01:26:29.021
SAM: That hits.

01:26:29.021 --> 01:26:38.813
MATT: You then suffer ten points of piercing
damage as the heavy crossbow bolt sinks

01:26:38.813 --> 01:26:42.640
itself into your shoulder and the armor takes the
brunt of it but you can still feel the pain of it

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:44.431
piercing just about an inch through.

01:26:44.431 --> 01:26:45.611
SAM: Damn it.

01:26:45.611 --> 01:26:48.273
MATT: That ends their go. Next up, we have
Keyleth.

01:26:48.273 --> 01:26:53.520
MARISHA: All right, I'm really pissed off at this
guy who just decked me in the face. So I'm going

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:55.126
to cast Call Lightning.

01:26:55.126 --> 01:26:58.346
MATT: All righty.

01:26:58.346 --> 01:27:06.974
MARISHA: And can I reach out and, the guy who hit
me, can I reach out and grab him and call it right

01:27:06.974 --> 01:27:11.005
into him?

01:27:11.005 --> 01:27:12.830
TRAVIS: Like conductor-style.

01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:16.589
MARISHA: Yeah. Just grab his face after he just
punched me.

01:27:16.589 --> 01:27:23.313
MATT: Okay. So, the minute you do that, the
Polymorph fades and Trinket turns into a full bear.

01:27:23.313 --> 01:27:31.584
MARISHA: Dope! Even cooler! Totally meant to do
that.

01:27:31.584 --> 01:27:34.836
MATT: You can, but know wherever the bolt hits,
it's everything in a five-foot area. So you can

01:27:34.836 --> 01:27:36.289
hit the bolt behind him--

01:27:36.289 --> 01:27:37.540
MARISHA: Nah, I want to--

01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:38.525
MATT: You want to take it?

01:27:38.525 --> 01:27:39.463
MARISHA: I want to take it.

01:27:39.463 --> 01:27:40.293
MATT: All right.

01:27:40.293 --> 01:27:41.596
MARISHA: I'm pissed the &lt;i&gt;fuck&lt;/i&gt; off.

01:27:41.596 --> 01:27:44.692
MATT: So, as you put your hands up, the clouds
that are already forming from the storm--

01:27:44.692 --> 01:27:46.008
MARISHA: I was going to say, I get extra damage,
right?

01:27:46.008 --> 01:27:49.590
MATT: Yeah. They begin to grow darker and directly
above you and as you bring your hands up, your

01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:55.649
flames slowly drifting off your fingertips, you
bring your hand down, and as you do, a bolt of

01:27:55.649 --> 01:27:58.892
lightning comes streaking out of the sky, blasting
right into the guy in front of you. Go ahead and

01:27:58.892 --> 01:28:00.002
roll damage.

01:28:00.002 --> 01:28:02.762
MARISHA: Is it four? Do I get an extra d10? Is
that what I get, or--

01:28:02.762 --> 01:28:07.156
MATT: You get an additional d10, yes. 4d10
lightning damage.

01:28:07.156 --> 01:28:11.390
MARISHA: Do I get anything extra because I'm
holding on to him? Because I'm channeling it?

01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:13.557
MATT: I'll say no, that's more--

01:28:13.557 --> 01:28:14.922
TALIESIN: Fire damage?

01:28:14.922 --> 01:28:19.327
MATT: No, that would be a different attack,
unfortunately. You're holding him and the flames

01:28:19.327 --> 01:28:24.008
are licking up into his face. So it's a scary
visual.

01:28:24.008 --> 01:28:26.116
MARISHA: 25 points.

01:28:26.116 --> 01:28:30.756
MATT: 25 points of damage. He did not make the
save, I believe. Rolled a 15. What's your DC on

01:28:30.756 --> 01:28:32.114
that spell?

01:28:32.114 --> 01:28:33.160
MARISHA: 18.

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:37.945
MATT: Yeah. So the bolt comes down and I need you
to go ahead and make a save against your own spell.

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:43.241
MARISHA: Yep. Failed.

01:28:43.241 --> 01:28:45.240
MATT: Okay, so you also take that damage.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:46.429
MARISHA: Yep.

01:28:46.429 --> 01:28:48.169
MATT: But it was cool.

01:28:48.169 --> 01:28:51.465
MARISHA: I use my bonus action to go Minxie.

01:28:51.465 --> 01:28:57.326
LAURA: Whoa, I like it! We ain't seen Minxie in
a while.

01:28:57.326 --> 01:29:02.433
MARISHA: Yeah, it's been a while.

01:29:02.433 --> 01:29:03.574
LAURA: Nice!

01:29:03.574 --> 01:29:07.805
MATT: As the guy's looking, reeling from the
impact of the blast, he pulls away, smoke coming

01:29:07.805 --> 01:29:15.170
off his chest. He gets his mace ready as he looks
up and sees you change into this giant white

01:29:15.170 --> 01:29:16.616
sabretooth tiger with these claws--

01:29:16.616 --> 01:29:18.766
MARISHA: I get a little bit of foam going, you know.

01:29:18.766 --> 01:29:22.529
LAURA: I like that right before it he saw a giant
bear appear.

01:29:22.529 --> 01:29:24.222
(laughter)

01:29:24.222 --> 01:29:26.247
MATT: Yeah, it just got somehow weirder.

01:29:26.247 --> 01:29:28.160
MARISHA: This means I can finally use my gift from
Mary!

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:36.288
MATT: All right. That ends Keyleh's turn. Garthok,
you're up.

01:29:36.288 --> 01:29:42.915
JASON: Great, I move over and take that one on--

01:29:42.915 --> 01:29:44.246
MATT: Over here?

01:29:44.246 --> 01:29:52.497
JASON: Keep going straight. No, no, the other way.
No. Okay now. Sorry. Yes. No, wait, okay, I was

01:29:52.497 --> 01:29:53.639
going to go to--

01:29:53.639 --> 01:29:55.111
MATT: You have laser pointers at the table.

01:29:55.111 --> 01:29:56.281
SAM: Someone give him a laser pointer.

01:29:56.281 --> 01:29:58.760
MARISHA: Sorry, I had it and I was distracted.

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:01.653
JASON: There.

01:30:01.653 --> 01:30:04.395
MATT: Oh, right here? Got you, okay. So you rush
up to there.

01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:09.982
JASON: And I flank. Since they're engaged, can I
use my sneak attack?

01:30:09.982 --> 01:30:15.148
MATT: Yeah, if you hit, you hit with the sneak
attack. So as you rush out very quickly, you see

01:30:15.148 --> 01:30:21.649
he pulls out a spear, like a short spear, but it's
curved kris-like at the blade and it's smaller

01:30:21.649 --> 01:30:26.792
than most short spears you've seen. It's a custom
piece of work. And he slides up and attempts to

01:30:26.792 --> 01:30:28.746
jam it into the thug in front of you.

01:30:28.746 --> 01:30:31.261
LIAM and LAURA: Get it!

01:30:31.261 --> 01:30:34.094
JASON: 15.

01:30:34.094 --> 01:30:36.379
MATT: 15 hits. Go ahead and roll damage and sneak
attack damage.

01:30:36.379 --> 01:30:45.115
JASON: Hell yeah. So, let's see, I need some more
d6s. Do you want me to do the sneak attack damage

01:30:45.115 --> 01:30:48.172
first or the weapon damage first, or add it all at
the end?

01:30:48.172 --> 01:30:50.916
MATT: Just add it all together and then add your
modifier at the end.

01:30:50.916 --> 01:30:58.266
MARISHA: Grr. I'm so excited.

01:30:58.266 --> 01:30:59.976
MATT: Grog, you're on deck, so be ready.

01:30:59.976 --> 01:31:02.062
MARISHA: This is what life is about, you guys.

01:31:02.062 --> 01:31:06.592
MATT: This was the night Marisha took somebody's
eyes out.

01:31:06.592 --> 01:31:07.832
MARISHA: (laughs) I know, I know.

01:31:07.832 --> 01:31:09.523
JASON: 28.

01:31:09.523 --> 01:31:17.055
MATT: 28 points of damage. Nice! All righty. So,
as the spear easily pierces past armor and you can

01:31:17.055 --> 01:31:22.536
see the haggard-looking woman then looks over and
the spear itself is stuck in her midsection. As

01:31:22.536 --> 01:31:26.997
you withdraw it, you can see a gout of blood pour
out afterward of the wound itself, leaving behind

01:31:26.997 --> 01:31:28.444
a pretty nasty--

01:31:28.444 --> 01:31:31.854
JASON: My eyes widen in battle-lust.

01:31:31.854 --> 01:31:33.654
(laughter)

01:31:33.654 --> 01:31:37.450
MATT: Orc jaw quivers, the teeth exposed. Okay, is
that your turn?

01:31:37.450 --> 01:31:38.439
JASON: Yes.

01:31:38.439 --> 01:31:40.583
MATT: Okay, you still have a bonus action if you
wanted to disengage.

01:31:40.583 --> 01:31:44.949
JASON: Oh, yeah. So I can disengage without 
attack of opportunity?

01:31:44.949 --> 01:31:51.056
MATT: If you use disengage and then move past. You
moved three spaces. You can disengage and move

01:31:51.056 --> 01:31:56.266
back four more spaces if you want to, with your
speed. Your call. Or you can stay there and lock

01:31:56.266 --> 01:31:57.584
him in place.

01:31:57.584 --> 01:31:58.592
JASON: You know what? I'm going to stay.

01:31:58.592 --> 01:31:59.858
MATT: Okay, cool. Grog, you're up.

01:31:59.858 --> 01:32:06.015
TRAVIS: After taking a few hits from the
sacrificial lamb that stands between Vax and I, I

01:32:06.015 --> 01:32:12.044
unsheathe Craven Edge, feeling the goosebumps rush
up my skin, and I look down at him and say, please

01:32:12.044 --> 01:32:18.350
run. And I draw the blade across my hand and I go
into a frenzied rage.

01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:20.338
(laughter)

01:32:20.338 --> 01:32:26.037
MATT: All righty. At which point, the blood
touching the blade, it curves down the obsidian

01:32:26.037 --> 01:32:30.800
and then sinks into the actual weapon. It doesn't
even have a moment to drip before the blade seems

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:32.634
to absorb the blood that you put on it.

01:32:32.634 --> 01:32:41.056
TRAVIS: We're bonded. It's a match made in heaven.
I would also like to use reckless attack as I take

01:32:41.056 --> 01:32:43.397
my three attacks at this piece of shit.

01:32:43.397 --> 01:32:45.978
MATT: Well, it's a bonus action to rage, so you
get two attacks this turn.

01:32:45.978 --> 01:32:47.008
TRAVIS: Two attacks this turn.

01:32:47.008 --> 01:32:50.094
MATT: Yeah. Reckless attack it up, man.

01:32:50.094 --> 01:32:52.108
TRAVIS: That is a 19.

01:32:52.108 --> 01:32:54.701
MATT: That hits. These are Great Weapon Master?

01:32:54.701 --> 01:32:58.410
TRAVIS: Yes. And that is-- not great, that's 11.

01:32:58.410 --> 01:33:02.752
MATT: 11 still hits. These guys aren't very
well-armored.

01:33:02.752 --> 01:33:06.736
LAURA: Loser! Loser with your 11 AC!

01:33:06.736 --> 01:33:11.812
TRAVIS: That's a 22 for the first one.

01:33:11.812 --> 01:33:13.198
MATT: Okay.

01:33:13.198 --> 01:33:18.676
TRAVIS: 19 on the second one.

01:33:18.676 --> 01:33:20.059
MATT: Okay.

01:33:20.059 --> 01:33:22.907
TRAVIS: And they both have to make the DC saving
throw.

01:33:22.907 --> 01:33:24.467
MATT: Both against the same individual?

01:33:24.467 --> 01:33:25.776
TRAVIS: Yeah, same guy.

01:33:25.776 --> 01:33:32.844
MATT: Makes the first save with a 19. Fails the
second one. So the first strike streaks across.

01:33:32.844 --> 01:33:39.588
You can see it cuts a huge gash across the upper
body as the burly-looking looter glances back at

01:33:39.588 --> 01:33:45.060
you (heavy breathing). Brings up a shortsword and
is about to go in for the pierce, at which point

01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:50.319
you kick her away from you about a foot and draw
the blade around, and this time you run the blade

01:33:50.319 --> 01:33:55.977
right into her torso, piercing her through. As she
looks up at you, you can see her skin go pale as

01:33:55.977 --> 01:34:00.127
her strength is drawn into the blade. You get to
add a point to your strength.

01:34:00.127 --> 01:34:02.549
LAURA: What! How long does that last?

01:34:02.549 --> 01:34:04.437
MATT: That lasts until your next short rest.

01:34:04.437 --> 01:34:06.679
LAURA: Don't rest ever!

01:34:06.679 --> 01:34:09.670
(laughter)

01:34:09.670 --> 01:34:13.940
MATT: So yeah, your strength's now 18, so add plus
one to your attack damage going forward.

01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:15.288
TRAVIS: Plus one to damage?

01:34:15.288 --> 01:34:20.567
MATT: Yeah. To hit and damage with your attacks.
But you pull the blade out and she crumples to the ground.

01:34:20.567 --> 01:34:24.447
LAURA: So for every person you hit, it makes it
better and better and better!

01:34:24.447 --> 01:34:28.926
TRAVIS: Can I look over my shoulder to the guy on
the left and like, you're next!

01:34:28.926 --> 01:34:36.052
MATT: You very much can. You can see the
visual of this presentation seems to have

01:34:36.052 --> 01:34:39.615
shaken their resolve, though not enough to the
point where they're backing down yet. The

01:34:39.615 --> 01:34:43.105
desperation kicks in. All right, that ends your
turn, Grog? You're staying there?

01:34:43.105 --> 01:34:44.357
TRAVIS: I'll stay there.

01:34:44.357 --> 01:34:45.814
MATT: All right. Scanlan, you're up.

01:34:45.814 --> 01:34:48.230
SAM: Okay, so the guy next to Percy is the dwarf?

01:34:48.230 --> 01:34:49.340
MATT: Correct.

01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:55.501
SAM: Okay. I will hand-cone it up and I will cast
Dominate Person on him.

01:34:55.501 --> 01:34:57.214
MATT: (laughs) Okay!

01:34:57.214 --> 01:34:59.947
SAM: And I will try to bend him to my will.

01:34:59.947 --> 01:35:01.562
MATT: That is a failed save and a half.

01:35:01.562 --> 01:35:03.098
SAM: Okay, good.

01:35:03.098 --> 01:35:09.926
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of that, we'll
use the blue one. So, yeah. As a bonus action each

01:35:09.926 --> 01:35:12.006
turn, you can basically tell him what to do.

01:35:12.006 --> 01:35:18.143
SAM: Okay. I will tell him to walk over to me and
start emptying his pockets of anything he's

01:35:18.143 --> 01:35:19.910
looted. Straight-up.

01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:21.553
(laughter)

01:35:21.553 --> 01:35:26.139
MATT: The dwarf's face goes limp and drops the
mace on the ground and looks over towards you, the

01:35:26.139 --> 01:35:31.411
eyes glazed over, and goes, "Certainly, Master. It
would be my pleasure." And begins to rifle through

01:35:31.411 --> 01:35:34.101
the pockets. Okay. You want to move anywhere or
you staying where you are?

01:35:34.101 --> 01:35:36.129
SAM: No, I'll stay there to accept my treasure.

01:35:36.129 --> 01:35:38.694
(laughter)

01:35:38.694 --> 01:35:40.515
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up.

01:35:40.515 --> 01:35:45.531
LIAM: Okay, so, I'm going to take the Dagger of
Life-Stealing and I'm going to stab the person

01:35:45.531 --> 01:35:51.065
closer to you, yeah? So that's a 23.

01:35:51.065 --> 01:35:52.147
MATT: Hits.

01:35:52.147 --> 01:36:04.268
LIAM: So we'll do that first. That is 11. No,
that's ten. Ten. And then I'm going to use

01:36:04.268 --> 01:36:10.246
disengage as my bonus action and I'm going to
pivot, roll around Grog along the south side of

01:36:10.246 --> 01:36:16.224
him, and spin around and stick the Keen Dagger
into the neck of the guy behind him. I'm going to

01:36:16.224 --> 01:36:20.545
use Luck. That's better. And that is 24.

01:36:20.545 --> 01:36:22.337
MATT: All righty. That hits.

01:36:22.337 --> 01:36:27.165
LIAM: That's sneak attack. 11 plus this.

01:36:27.165 --> 01:36:30.073
MATT: So wait, this is with your-- did you click
your Boots of Haste on this?

01:36:30.073 --> 01:36:31.709
LIAM: No. So two attacks?

01:36:31.709 --> 01:36:35.179
MATT: You get two attacks, but you used your bonus
action to disengage, which would've been your

01:36:35.179 --> 01:36:36.525
second attack, so you wouldn't get--

01:36:36.525 --> 01:36:38.103
LIAM: Oh, then I'm out. All right, I'm out.

01:36:38.103 --> 01:36:39.402
MATT: Okay. So you move over there?

01:36:39.402 --> 01:36:45.037
LIAM: Yeah, I'll use disengage and I'm going to
back up against Grog.

01:36:45.037 --> 01:36:50.603
MATT: Okay, right there? All right. You're still
in combat with that person.

01:36:50.603 --> 01:36:51.994
LIAM: Back-to-back with the big man.

01:36:51.994 --> 01:36:53.461
MATT: Great, so you guys are like back-to-back
right now, looking around.

01:36:53.461 --> 01:36:55.470
LAURA: Awesome. Look at you buddies!

01:36:55.470 --> 01:36:56.603
LIAM: Uh, not really.

01:36:56.603 --> 01:36:59.146
MATT: Pike, your turn!

01:36:59.146 --> 01:37:01.845
ASHLEY: Okay, does anybody need healing?

01:37:01.845 --> 01:37:02.853
LAURA: Not yet!

01:37:02.853 --> 01:37:04.686
TRAVIS: Fuck somebody up.

01:37:04.686 --> 01:37:06.692
ASHLEY: Time for attack!

01:37:06.692 --> 01:37:08.848
(laughter)

01:37:08.848 --> 01:37:13.043
ASHLEY: Am I close to the guy with the crossbow?

01:37:13.043 --> 01:37:21.100
MATT: To which one? Crossbow, uh. You're about 20,
30 feet from him.

01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:25.591
ASHLEY: Okay, I'd like to move up a little bit,
because I'm going to Guiding Bolt him.

01:37:25.591 --> 01:37:26.745
MATT: All right.

01:37:26.745 --> 01:37:30.645
ASHLEY: And I'm going to do it at second level.

01:37:30.645 --> 01:37:32.362
MATT: 2nd-level Guiding Bolt.

01:37:32.362 --> 01:37:33.864
ASHLEY: But first I will roll for--

01:37:33.864 --> 01:37:42.997
MATT: All righty. So what'd you roll to hit? With
your spell attack modifier?

01:37:42.997 --> 01:37:44.765
ASHLEY: I rolled a 14.

01:37:44.765 --> 01:37:49.076
MATT: 14 hits. That hits, so go ahead and roll 5d6
radiant damage on him.

01:37:49.076 --> 01:37:52.884
LAURA: Fuck. Guiding Bolt's pretty sick.

01:37:52.884 --> 01:38:07.527
ASHLEY: Nice. Cool. 21.

01:38:07.527 --> 01:38:14.401
MATT: 21, nice! So as you rush forward, keeping
your mace to the side, you put the shield down and

01:38:14.401 --> 01:38:19.067
the holy symbol itself drifts off you for a moment
and you focus for a second and without having to

01:38:19.067 --> 01:38:24.086
put your hands on it, a beam of divine energy
bursts forward, slamming into the

01:38:24.086 --> 01:38:29.991
crossbow-wielding individual and seems to surround
their torso, causing them to glow like a giant

01:38:29.991 --> 01:38:37.473
beacon that says hit me! They look down at this
tiny armored gnome that knocked half their life

01:38:37.473 --> 01:38:44.720
out of their body with a bit of confusion, worry,
and respect in a weird way. Well done, gnome.

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.425
ASHLEY: Yeah!

01:38:46.425 --> 01:38:47.994
MATT: Okay, does that end your turn?

01:38:47.994 --> 01:38:53.987
ASHLEY: Can I try to intimidate him, to tell him
to drop his bow?

01:38:53.987 --> 01:38:57.736
MATT: Uh. As a bonus action, I'll let you do that,
sure.

01:38:57.736 --> 01:39:00.438
ASHLEY: All right. Drop your bow!

01:39:00.438 --> 01:39:02.215
(laughter)

01:39:02.215 --> 01:39:04.778
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll an intimidate
check.

01:39:04.778 --> 01:39:12.487
ASHLEY: Which I don't think I have any of that,
let's see. Oh, this is going to be hilarious. 11!

01:39:12.487 --> 01:39:17.785
MATT: 11. As you shout, the individual gives you a
keen look and almost chuckles to himself, going,

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:19.968
(laughs) "Silly gnome."

01:39:19.968 --> 01:39:21.809
ASHLEY: It was a joke! It was a joke.

01:39:21.809 --> 01:39:25.889
MATT: Puts the crossbow up, aiming it right
towards between the eyes.

01:39:25.889 --> 01:39:27.453
ASHLEY: Oh no!

01:39:27.453 --> 01:39:30.010
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Vex, you're
up.

01:39:30.010 --> 01:39:35.270
LAURA: Awesome. As my bonus action I'm going to
cast Hail of Thorns, so my next attack that hits

01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:36.778
turns into a poof.

01:39:36.778 --> 01:39:37.933
MATT: Burst, yes.

01:39:37.933 --> 01:39:44.238
LAURA: Okay. So I'm going to do that and then I'm
going to cast-- I'm going to shoot-- oh shit. Can

01:39:44.238 --> 01:39:50.788
I shoot through the guy in front of me or to the
guy with the bolt? Or is that too hard?

01:39:50.788 --> 01:39:56.539
MATT: You can, you could, I'd say. You're at
disadvantage already because you're in melee with

01:39:56.539 --> 01:39:59.070
two individuals, so all your attacks are at
disadvantage right now.

01:39:59.070 --> 01:40:00.168
LAURA: Balls.

01:40:00.168 --> 01:40:01.847
MATT: You can try and move away.

01:40:01.847 --> 01:40:03.428
LAURA: But they would hit me?

01:40:03.428 --> 01:40:04.447
MATT: They would attack you.

01:40:04.447 --> 01:40:06.860
LAURA: I'm going to move back five feet.

01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:08.843
MATT: Okay, so you jump back that way.

01:40:08.843 --> 01:40:09.639
LAURA: Yeah.

01:40:09.639 --> 01:40:15.546
MATT: All right, that's two of them get swings at
you. That's a natural two, so no. That is a

01:40:15.546 --> 01:40:18.839
natural eight, so 13, so misses you.

01:40:18.839 --> 01:40:27.065
LAURA: Fuck both of you, as I back up. And then I
shoot the arrow at the guy in the middle of the two.

01:40:27.065 --> 01:40:29.379
MATT: Right there? All right, go for it.

01:40:29.379 --> 01:40:38.286
LAURA: Okay. That is 22 to hit.

01:40:38.286 --> 01:40:39.550
MATT: That hits.

01:40:39.550 --> 01:40:47.934
LAURA: Okay, so. That means-- I'm casting that at
third level, so that's 3d10 of damage.

01:40:47.934 --> 01:40:49.208
MATT: Correct.

01:40:49.208 --> 01:40:51.395
LAURA: Right. And that's just my first attack.

01:40:51.395 --> 01:40:52.509
MATT: All right.

01:40:52.509 --> 01:40:54.055
LAURA: Where's my other dice?

01:40:54.055 --> 01:40:56.084
MATT: And it's 3d10 against the first one.

01:40:56.084 --> 01:41:02.468
LAURA: Come on! That's seven, eight, nine.

01:41:02.468 --> 01:41:04.530
MATT: Nine? All righty.

01:41:04.530 --> 01:41:06.997
LAURA: Then, do I do that for each person or
that's it?

01:41:06.997 --> 01:41:10.109
MATT: No, you then roll a d10 and they have to
make a dex saving throw to try and not get damage,

01:41:10.109 --> 01:41:11.378
so roll a d10.

01:41:11.378 --> 01:41:12.997
LAURA: That's a ten.

01:41:12.997 --> 01:41:17.561
MATT: They all fail, so did more damage to the
guys around him than the actual--

01:41:17.561 --> 01:41:26.942
LAURA: Nice. And then I'm going to move Trinket
around. No, he's going to move up and attack the

01:41:26.942 --> 01:41:28.383
guy in front of him.

01:41:28.383 --> 01:41:31.153
MATT: You've done a bonus and an action.

01:41:31.153 --> 01:41:33.378
LAURA: Yeah, so I get to cast--

01:41:33.378 --> 01:41:37.079
MATT: Oh, I see, so your attack second, third, and
you get your one attack as part of the attack action.

01:41:37.079 --> 01:41:41.666
LAURA: Right. So I wanted Trinket to do his
Bestial Fury.

01:41:41.666 --> 01:41:43.024
MATT: Okay, so move up now and do it to
that--

01:41:43.024 --> 01:41:45.689
LAURA: Yeah, he's doing Bestial Fury and claw that
motherfucker.

01:41:45.689 --> 01:41:48.049
MATT: Okay, this guy right there? Or that?

01:41:48.049 --> 01:41:50.024
LAURA: That. No, the other one.

01:41:50.024 --> 01:41:55.701
MATT: This one? All right. Go for it. So, as the
bear that just appeared now rears back, you fire

01:41:55.701 --> 01:42:01.291
an arrow that explodes into a burst of sharpened
wooden bits. As they all reel from the

01:42:01.291 --> 01:42:07.297
impact, the bear (roars) and Trinket rushes
forward on his giant paws, releasing a torrent of

01:42:07.297 --> 01:42:10.453
claw strikes against one of the unsuspecting
thugs.

01:42:10.453 --> 01:42:12.531
LAURA: That's 14.

01:42:12.531 --> 01:42:13.950
MATT: 14 hits.

01:42:13.950 --> 01:42:17.989
LAURA: And then 2d4 plus seven.

01:42:17.989 --> 01:42:20.554
MATT: Correct. You get two attacks with Trinket,
by the way.

01:42:20.554 --> 01:42:21.896
LAURA: Oh, sweet.

01:42:21.896 --> 01:42:24.528
MATT: Because Trinket attacks twice when he does
Bestial--

01:42:24.528 --> 01:42:26.064
LAURA: That's 11 on the first.

01:42:26.064 --> 01:42:27.453
MATT: 11 damage.

01:42:27.453 --> 01:42:30.846
LAURA: And 13 on the second.

01:42:30.846 --> 01:42:40.722
MATT: Okay. So Trinket runs forward and one claw
tears the face off, jaw unhinged. The friend at

01:42:40.722 --> 01:42:45.340
the side looks horrified as Trinket then bears
down with the secondary claw and takes the

01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:47.152
remainder of the head off the shoulders.

01:42:47.152 --> 01:42:52.169
LAURA: Very nice, very nice.

01:42:52.169 --> 01:42:54.177
SAM: Go Trinket.

01:42:54.177 --> 01:42:57.221
MATT: Power in those claws. All right. That ends
your turn?

01:42:57.221 --> 01:42:58.241
LAURA: Yeah.

01:42:58.241 --> 01:42:59.726
MATT: Percy, you're up.

01:42:59.726 --> 01:43:01.479
TALIESIN: Is that crossbow asshole still
standing?

01:43:01.479 --> 01:43:02.777
MATT: The crossbow?

01:43:02.777 --> 01:43:04.852
TALIESIN: The guy who just laughed at our little
gnome?

01:43:04.852 --> 01:43:05.841
MATT: Yeah.

01:43:05.841 --> 01:43:11.003
TALIESIN: Okay. I've just noticed that my guy was
going to hit me and then started acting weird, so

01:43:11.003 --> 01:43:16.252
taking a second to look around, I'm going to see
that little laugh with the crossbow coming up and

01:43:16.252 --> 01:43:18.710
Indiana Jones that shit.

01:43:18.710 --> 01:43:20.977
MATT: Okay. Are you putting your Hex on him?

01:43:20.977 --> 01:43:22.891
TALIESIN: I'm putting my Hex on him first.

01:43:22.891 --> 01:43:24.526
MATT: Okay, bonus action to do that.

01:43:24.526 --> 01:43:27.528
TALIESIN: Sharpshooter shot to that guy.

01:43:27.528 --> 01:43:28.438
MATT: Go for it.

01:43:28.438 --> 01:43:29.869
SAM: Don't hit Pike, don't hit Pike.

01:43:29.869 --> 01:43:30.964
TALIESIN: I'm not going to hit Pike.

01:43:30.964 --> 01:43:32.119
SAM: She's right in the middle!

01:43:32.119 --> 01:43:33.129
LIAM: Only if it's a one.

01:43:33.129 --> 01:43:34.138
ASHLEY: It's okay, it's okay.

01:43:34.138 --> 01:43:43.684
TALIESIN: Out of curiosity, I'm trying to
remember, what's my fuck-up number, my misfire

01:43:43.684 --> 01:43:45.068
number for that gun?

01:43:45.068 --> 01:43:45.947
MATT: The pistol?

01:43:45.947 --> 01:43:46.782
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:43:46.782 --> 01:43:47.708
MATT: One.

01:43:47.708 --> 01:43:49.141
TALIESIN: It's higher than one, I thought.

01:43:49.141 --> 01:43:53.115
MATT: No, the pistol's the most basic one. It's
one. But you rebuilt it, though.

01:43:53.115 --> 01:43:54.033
TALIESIN: I did.

01:43:54.033 --> 01:43:56.252
MATT: To not be that terrible. So now it's fine,
it's normal.

01:43:56.252 --> 01:43:57.326
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

01:43:57.326 --> 01:44:01.652
MATT: Yeah. Before you reconstructed it to try and
fix the mistake and remove that additional

01:44:01.652 --> 01:44:03.286
attachment, it would have been one.

01:44:03.286 --> 01:44:06.744
TALIESIN: Thank you, I was just checking, because
I could've just rolled really poorly. Ten.

01:44:06.744 --> 01:44:08.542
MATT: Ten misses, unfortunately.

01:44:08.542 --> 01:44:09.846
TALIESIN: All right, I'm taking another--

01:44:09.846 --> 01:44:15.593
MATT: Oh, there's the Guiding Bolt, right? It's
all right. Yeah, missed the Guiding Bolt, so you

01:44:15.593 --> 01:44:17.404
have advantage on that attack, I'm pretty sure.

01:44:17.404 --> 01:44:19.786
TALIESIN: Oh, so I'm going to roll it again.

01:44:19.786 --> 01:44:21.455
LIAM: Thank you, Pike.

01:44:21.455 --> 01:44:22.870
ASHLEY: You're welcome!

01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:24.825
MARISHA: Same fucking roll.

01:44:24.825 --> 01:44:26.959
TALIESIN: I don't know what happened. Okay. Ten.
So that--

01:44:26.959 --> 01:44:29.997
MATT: So that one fires and now you're out of
bullets.

01:44:29.997 --> 01:44:32.169
TALIESIN: I know, so now I'm going to reload and
fire again.

01:44:32.169 --> 01:44:34.332
MATT: Okay, so your second and third attack. Go
for it.

01:44:34.332 --> 01:44:38.810
MARISHA: Oh my god!

01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:40.619
TALIESIN: I have advantage though, right?

01:44:40.619 --> 01:44:43.335
MATT: You have advantage. I think you do, hold on,
let me see.

01:44:43.335 --> 01:44:44.931
MARISHA: There we go, that's better.

01:44:44.931 --> 01:44:52.136
MATT: Hold on, hold on. Next attack, no, it does
not have advantage. So that misses as well,

01:44:52.136 --> 01:44:53.101
probably.

01:44:53.101 --> 01:44:54.372
ASHLEY: War God's Blessing!

01:44:54.372 --> 01:44:55.759
MATT: So! War God's Blessing?

01:44:55.759 --> 01:44:59.964
ASHLEY: Yeah, it adds ten to his roll. Attack
roll.

01:44:59.964 --> 01:45:01.788
MATT: Okay, so it now becomes a 20.

01:45:01.788 --> 01:45:02.942
TALIESIN: Oh.

01:45:02.942 --> 01:45:04.332
SAM: What is War God's Blessing?

01:45:04.332 --> 01:45:07.789
MATT: So War God's Blessing is one of her cleric
abilities, since she chose the war domain after

01:45:07.789 --> 01:45:13.083
going to sea for a while. The specifics of it,
just so you guys are aware of it, and why it's so useful--

01:45:13.083 --> 01:45:14.883
ASHLEY: It's something I forget about a lot.

01:45:14.883 --> 01:45:15.805
TALIESIN: Oh, yay!

01:45:15.805 --> 01:45:20.229
MATT: She can basically, as a reaction, grant plus
ten to an attack roll.

01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:22.384
TALIESIN: Yeah, that hit, then. That hits.

01:45:22.384 --> 01:45:28.341
MATT: So go ahead and roll damage now. So, as
you're about to aim, Pike looks over and sees you

01:45:28.341 --> 01:45:31.937
about to take the shot and concentrates for a
moment and the front of your barrel begins to glow

01:45:31.937 --> 01:45:36.835
with divine light as you fire. The bullet itself
actually is white-hot as it leaves the barrel.

01:45:36.835 --> 01:45:38.492
TALIESIN: This is such a confused gun.

01:45:38.492 --> 01:45:39.475
MATT: I know.

01:45:39.475 --> 01:45:47.069
TALIESIN: Okay. That's not bad. That's 20 plus
five necrotic.

01:45:47.069 --> 01:45:56.338
MATT: Okay. The impact of the divine enchanted
bullet hits the current dark-energy-hexed

01:45:56.338 --> 01:46:03.690
individual and in the blast of light versus dark
the upper torso of the thug is incinerated. It is

01:46:03.690 --> 01:46:09.912
ash. The waist below visible as it slumps over, no
longer visible.

01:46:09.912 --> 01:46:12.121
MARISHA: That was awesome!

01:46:12.121 --> 01:46:17.572
TALIESIN: And I'm going to start walking my way
towards Keyleth's special friend. Yeah, about there.

01:46:17.572 --> 01:46:18.878
MATT: There? Okay.

01:46:18.878 --> 01:46:20.823
TALIESIN: I'm not running. I'm walking.

01:46:20.823 --> 01:46:29.864
MATT: All right. It's now their turn. The dwarf
now moves over, goes, "Of course." And begins

01:46:29.864 --> 01:46:34.830
taking all of its weapons and throws its mace down
and puts its crossbow at your feet, spends its

01:46:34.830 --> 01:46:38.638
entire turn emptying its pouch and handing you
what gold and gems and things it gathered.

01:46:38.638 --> 01:46:40.229
LAURA: This is the best thing ever!

01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:43.897
MATT: And giving you everything with a big
dwarvish smile underneath its crusty beard.

01:46:43.897 --> 01:46:46.898
SAM: Thank you. You're doing a good service.

01:46:46.898 --> 01:46:48.982
TALIESIN: Make him shave.

01:46:48.982 --> 01:46:52.408
LAURA: That is mean.

01:46:52.408 --> 01:46:53.665
TALIESIN: I know!

01:46:53.665 --> 01:47:00.369
MATT: This one's going to attack Keyleth. So, the
one attacking Keyleth. This is the one attacking

01:47:00.369 --> 01:47:01.314
you, Keyleth.

01:47:01.314 --> 01:47:02.221
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

01:47:02.221 --> 01:47:04.635
MATT: It saw you transform into Minxie. That's
going to be, what's your AC?

01:47:04.635 --> 01:47:09.207
MARISHA: As a tiger? Or no, I keep my AC, right?
Or no, I take the tiger's AC.

01:47:09.207 --> 01:47:15.680
MATT: It should be in your ability, your Wild
Shape ability. I'm pretty sure you take it as the

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:16.749
creature.

01:47:16.749 --> 01:47:17.792
MARISHA: Then 11.

01:47:17.792 --> 01:47:25.216
MATT: 11, that hits. Just making sure that's the
case right now, real fast as we go over to this point.

01:47:25.281 --> 01:47:31.261
MARISHA: I know I keep all of my brain stats, but
I lose all my physical stats.

01:47:31.261 --> 01:47:37.965
MATT: Correct. Yeah, you gain the AC of the
creature as well.

01:47:37.965 --> 01:47:39.313
MARISHA: Okay, so 11.

01:47:39.313 --> 01:47:40.708
MATT: All right, so.

01:47:40.708 --> 01:47:45.978
MARISHA: Oh no, wait, wait, wait, wait. 12.

01:47:45.978 --> 01:47:50.190
MATT: 12 is the AC? First one misses, second one
hits.

01:47:50.190 --> 01:47:52.014
MARISHA: Oh, cool! Okay, cool.

01:47:52.014 --> 01:47:58.872
MATT: It rolled 11 on the first attack. So, you do
take 11 points of bludgeoning damage as the mace

01:47:58.872 --> 01:48:02.196
swings out and smacks into the side of your
shoulder. You feel the impact, but it's nothing

01:48:02.196 --> 01:48:08.303
too harsh. There are two of them now that are
trying to go against Grog, being the angry one

01:48:08.303 --> 01:48:13.131
that just bisected their ally. They have advantage
on you because they are both pack tactics. The

01:48:13.131 --> 01:48:15.826
first attack is a 23.

01:48:15.826 --> 01:48:17.227
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:48:17.227 --> 01:48:23.693
MATT: Second one is a natural 20. Third attack,
with advantage, is 15.

01:48:23.693 --> 01:48:24.911
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:48:24.911 --> 01:48:27.935
MATT: Misses. And the fourth and final one is a
17.

01:48:27.935 --> 01:48:28.812
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:48:28.812 --> 01:48:41.042
MATT: So a hit and a natural 20. Okay, so that is
nine reduced to five against you. And then 12

01:48:41.042 --> 01:48:44.851
reduced to six, so you take 11 points of
bludgeoning damage between the two of them trying

01:48:44.851 --> 01:48:51.247
to beat on this furious angry goliath individual.
And then there's one over here that's attacking

01:48:51.247 --> 01:48:53.193
Trinket now that's right in front.

01:48:53.193 --> 01:48:58.070
LAURA: He just saw Trinket rip somebody else's
face off.

01:48:58.070 --> 01:49:02.259
MATT: Yeah, and in doing so swings out with a 13.
I'm pretty sure misses Trinket's AC.

01:49:02.259 --> 01:49:06.698
LAURA: Oh, yeah it does. He's got a better armor
class than me.

01:49:06.698 --> 01:49:11.203
MATT: He swings out, shaken by what it just saw
happen to its friend and then takes that anger and

01:49:11.203 --> 01:49:16.636
turns around, rolling a 23, which I'm pretty sure
hits. The mace slams into the side of Trinket's

01:49:16.636 --> 01:49:22.875
armor with a resounding (loud impact), the actual
echo of the metal impact audible in the immediate

01:49:22.875 --> 01:49:25.966
vicinity, dealing a total of seven points of
bludgeoning damage to Trinket.

01:49:25.966 --> 01:49:29.268
LAURA: He's resistant to bludgeoning damage
because of his armor.

01:49:29.268 --> 01:49:33.335
MATT: Yep, so that would make it four. All right,
that ends their turn. Keyleth, you're up.

01:49:33.335 --> 01:49:38.800
MARISHA: Okay. Really pissed off at this guy
still. I'm going to concentrate and bring down a

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:42.054
bolt of lightning in front of him, or behind--

01:49:42.054 --> 01:49:43.226
MATT: Right there?

01:49:43.226 --> 01:49:44.145
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:49:44.145 --> 01:49:46.003
SAM: Dragons can see bolts of lightning.

01:49:46.003 --> 01:49:47.624
MARISHA: It's also a cloudy day.

01:49:47.624 --> 01:49:48.950
SAM: All right, all right, that makes sense.

01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:55.534
MATT: Second bolt of lightning strikes the ground
behind the guy in front of you. He rolled a 20, so

01:49:55.534 --> 01:49:59.834
he did make his save I'm pretty sure against you.
Roll 4d10. He takes half-damage.

01:49:59.834 --> 01:50:12.309
MARISHA: So, okay. Six, ten, 21 points, so ten?

01:50:12.309 --> 01:50:13.945
MATT: Ten points of damage.

01:50:13.945 --> 01:50:18.058
MARISHA: And then I'm going to do an attack on
him. Grr.

01:50:18.058 --> 01:50:21.862
MATT: Uh, you have to use your action to pull the
bolt down, though?

01:50:21.862 --> 01:50:23.278
MARISHA: I thought it was bonus.

01:50:23.278 --> 01:50:27.561
MATT: It should say on the spell. I'll
double-check.

01:50:27.561 --> 01:50:32.488
MARISHA: I thought you could do that with Call
Lightning.

01:50:32.488 --> 01:50:39.800
MATT: Call Lightning, uh. On each of your turns,
you can use your action to call it down, so yeah.

01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:41.386
A bolt is what you got.

01:50:41.386 --> 01:50:42.825
MARISHA: Okay, that's fine.

01:50:42.825 --> 01:50:48.944
MATT: Okay. However, the individual now is twice
hit by lightning and is looking extremely rough

01:50:48.944 --> 01:50:53.377
and barely standing on his two feet. Is that your
turn?

01:50:53.377 --> 01:50:55.159
MARISHA: I can't do anything else, can I?

01:50:55.159 --> 01:50:56.419
MATT: Okay, Garthok, you're up.

01:50:56.419 --> 01:51:01.999
JASON: Garthok attacks the one attacking Trinket.

01:51:01.999 --> 01:51:02.983
MATT: Okay.

01:51:02.983 --> 01:51:05.778
JASON: And I can sneak attack, right?

01:51:05.778 --> 01:51:08.636
MATT: Yeah, he's currently distracted between you
and Trinket.

01:51:08.636 --> 01:51:10.373
SAM: What are you going to do, what are you going
to do?

01:51:10.373 --> 01:51:15.404
MATT: Roll to hit first.

01:51:15.404 --> 01:51:17.653
JASON: Oh yeah. I was so excited.

01:51:17.653 --> 01:51:19.356
SAM: What if you miss?

01:51:19.356 --> 01:51:21.140
LAURA: He won't miss.

01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:22.598
JASON: 13.

01:51:22.598 --> 01:51:24.401
MATT: 13 does hit.

01:51:24.401 --> 01:51:26.501
(cheering)

01:51:26.501 --> 01:51:28.058
TRAVIS: Skewer that piece of shit.

01:51:28.058 --> 01:51:31.903
MARISHA: Nice! That's hot.

01:51:31.903 --> 01:51:34.705
TRAVIS: Let the dice hit the floor.

01:51:34.705 --> 01:51:38.447
JASON: 20.

01:51:38.447 --> 01:51:46.161
MATT: 20 points. All right. So you take the spear
and jam it into the abdomen of this looter here

01:51:46.161 --> 01:51:50.903
who, the sheer force of it from the strength as
your muscles push in lifts him and slams him

01:51:50.903 --> 01:51:55.786
against the wall, you've partially pinned him
against the stonework there. He reaches over and

01:51:55.786 --> 01:51:59.578
slams down on your hand repeatedly until
eventually you withdraw and leave him back on his

01:51:59.578 --> 01:52:04.844
feet. He's looking rough, but he's definitely
still holding his own. Is that--?

01:52:04.844 --> 01:52:09.096
JASON: Can I use my cunning action with my hand
crossbow or--?

01:52:09.096 --> 01:52:13.172
MATT: Well, you can use a bonus action to fire
with your hand crossbow at him if you want to.

01:52:13.172 --> 01:52:14.129
JASON: Yeah.

01:52:14.129 --> 01:52:17.081
MATT: All right. It's at disadvantage because you
are in melee with him, so go ahead and roll twice

01:52:17.081 --> 01:52:18.712
and take the lower of the two.

01:52:18.712 --> 01:52:20.630
LAURA: This will be sick, though, if he hit it.

01:52:20.630 --> 01:52:28.632
SAM: Those are stinky dice.

01:52:28.632 --> 01:52:31.553
JASON: 11. 11.

01:52:31.553 --> 01:52:33.113
MATT: 11 just hits.

01:52:33.113 --> 01:52:35.412
(cheering)

01:52:35.412 --> 01:52:39.926
MATT: That's his AC. All right, so go ahead and
roll damage with the hand crossbow. 1d6 plus

01:52:39.926 --> 01:52:40.861
whatever.

01:52:40.861 --> 01:52:42.379
LAURA: Right in the face!

01:52:42.379 --> 01:52:43.321
JASON: Six.

01:52:43.321 --> 01:52:49.289
MATT: Six points of damage. As you pull the spear
out, you reach to your side and over-the-arm pull

01:52:49.289 --> 01:52:52.768
the hand crossbow out and fire. It goes right into
his left eye socket.

01:52:52.768 --> 01:52:56.128
(cheering)

01:52:56.128 --> 01:53:04.595
MATT: With that, you set the spear to the side and
lock in the next bolt for your hand crossbow. Are

01:53:04.595 --> 01:53:06.215
you staying there?

01:53:06.215 --> 01:53:07.157
JASON: Yeah.

01:53:07.157 --> 01:53:08.753
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Grog, you're
up.

01:53:08.753 --> 01:53:13.971
TRAVIS: The poor bastard that's closest to you to
my upper right, yeah, that little fuck's going to

01:53:13.971 --> 01:53:16.822
get Great Weapon Master relentless attacks.

01:53:16.822 --> 01:53:18.285
MATT: (laughs) Okay, all three?

01:53:18.285 --> 01:53:19.279
TRAVIS: All three.

01:53:19.279 --> 01:53:20.943
MATT: Go for it.

01:53:20.943 --> 01:53:25.813
TRAVIS: That is better. 14?

01:53:25.813 --> 01:53:26.986
MATT: Hits.

01:53:26.986 --> 01:53:30.242
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'll take that one.

01:53:30.242 --> 01:53:33.423
LAURA: You could've been a 20, though, your next
one could be a 20.

01:53:33.423 --> 01:53:35.081
MATT: Yeah, roll again. You never know.

01:53:35.081 --> 01:53:36.677
LAURA: It was a 20!

01:53:36.677 --> 01:53:38.335
MARISHA: Shut up!

01:53:38.335 --> 01:53:44.083
MATT: Which, as a note, at your level when you
crit you do two additional dice on top of it. So

01:53:44.083 --> 01:53:50.133
you roll, double it, and then do two additional
dice as one of your barbarian--

01:53:50.133 --> 01:53:52.118
TRAVIS: I had one additional damage dice.

01:53:52.118 --> 01:53:56.801
MATT: For this last level 13, you get two now.

01:53:56.801 --> 01:53:57.899
TRAVIS: Oh, jesus.

01:53:57.899 --> 01:53:59.148
SAM: This guy's going to be a puddle--

01:53:59.148 --> 01:54:00.718
LAURA: Another natural 20!

01:54:00.718 --> 01:54:02.572
SAM: Wait, does he get two more?

01:54:02.572 --> 01:54:09.158
TRAVIS: On crits or kills, it's an extra hit.

01:54:09.158 --> 01:54:15.550
MATT: Extra attack, okay. (laughs) Okay, so first,
hold on, first roll damage for the first attack

01:54:15.550 --> 01:54:16.611
against this one.

01:54:16.611 --> 01:54:17.979
TRAVIS: Me and the sword are vibing, man.

01:54:17.979 --> 01:54:19.491
MATT: Right. Roll damage on the first one.

01:54:19.491 --> 01:54:20.799
TRAVIS: Okay, yeah.

01:54:20.799 --> 01:54:22.182
LIAM: You're playing jazz, man.

01:54:22.182 --> 01:54:26.109
TRAVIS: 18, 28.

01:54:26.109 --> 01:54:31.030
MATT: 28, which fails save, you get another plus
one to your strength.

01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:32.932
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:54:32.932 --> 01:54:34.217
TRAVIS: Just the strength, right?

01:54:34.217 --> 01:54:42.302
MATT: Exactly. Second attack, which is the
critical. So, roll the dice, double that, add your

01:54:42.302 --> 01:54:44.019
modifier, and then add 2d12 to that.

01:54:44.019 --> 01:54:51.741
TRAVIS: That's a lot of math. Roll another dice.
That's a six--

01:54:51.741 --> 01:54:53.962
LAURA: 2d12.

01:54:53.962 --> 01:55:00.200
TRAVIS: 29, 40, 44?

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:01.453
SAM: What?

01:55:01.453 --> 01:55:04.854
MATT: And failed the save again. That's another
plus one to your strength.

01:55:04.854 --> 01:55:06.222
TRAVIS: That goes up two.

01:55:06.222 --> 01:55:07.253
MATT: Yeah.

01:55:07.253 --> 01:55:08.388
MARISHA: That keeps happening?

01:55:08.388 --> 01:55:15.966
MATT: So as you, the first two attacks, whoosh,
cut off the right arm of that individual, and

01:55:15.966 --> 01:55:20.273
using that momentum, you bring it around and
bisect him in the midsection. As that happens, you

01:55:20.273 --> 01:55:24.578
can see the blood turns from red to black as the
blade drinks it up and you feel your muscles pulse

01:55:24.578 --> 01:55:25.618
with energy.

01:55:25.618 --> 01:55:26.616
TRAVIS: Yes!

01:55:26.616 --> 01:55:28.607
MATT: Just falls back on the ground.

01:55:28.607 --> 01:55:30.731
LAURA: So now you can take the other guy, because
you killed him.

01:55:30.731 --> 01:55:32.327
TRAVIS: I critted on the third one.

01:55:32.327 --> 01:55:36.733
MATT: The third one, I'll say because you killed
him the third crit goes to the next guy, so go

01:55:36.733 --> 01:55:39.117
ahead and roll damage on that.

01:55:39.117 --> 01:55:47.003
TRAVIS: 22, 32.

01:55:47.003 --> 01:55:48.741
LIAM: He's gone.

01:55:48.741 --> 01:55:56.360
MATT: Okay. And now you get your additional attack
because of the Great Weapon Master.

01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:58.430
LAURA: Oh my lord.

01:55:58.430 --> 01:56:00.761
MATT: With advantage, because barbarians, man.

01:56:00.761 --> 01:56:02.129
TRAVIS: 21?

01:56:02.129 --> 01:56:09.714
MATT: Hits. When barbarians crit, man, things die.
This is why relentless attack is so good with

01:56:09.714 --> 01:56:11.621
them. They take the penalty to their AC.

01:56:11.621 --> 01:56:12.838
TRAVIS: 24 points.

01:56:12.838 --> 01:56:14.273
MATT: 24 points of damage.

01:56:14.273 --> 01:56:16.831
TRAVIS: Oh no, 34 points of damage because it's
Great Weapon Master.

01:56:16.831 --> 01:56:21.155
MATT: Failed save. All right. It made the last
one, all right.

01:56:21.155 --> 01:56:23.007
TRAVIS: Oh, plus two, 36 points.

01:56:23.007 --> 01:56:28.087
MATT: So there you go. So you get another plus one
to your strength. However, this time you take the

01:56:28.087 --> 01:56:33.138
blade and the first attack you jam it into their
abdomen like this. As they're looking at you,

01:56:33.138 --> 01:56:38.582
grasping at your shoulders, your eyes completely
covered in bloodlust, the foam at the corner of

01:56:38.582 --> 01:56:43.674
your mouth, you then put all of your strength at
the bottom of it and completely cut upward, the

01:56:43.674 --> 01:56:46.147
body splitting in half as it falls to the ground.

01:56:46.147 --> 01:56:51.709
(laughter)

01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:53.214
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

01:56:53.214 --> 01:56:55.533
TRAVIS: I've never been more happy in my life.

01:56:55.533 --> 01:57:00.107
ASHLEY: Oh man, I'm coming back as a barbarian if
I die.

01:57:00.107 --> 01:57:02.355
MATT: All right, Scanlan, you're up.

01:57:02.355 --> 01:57:03.792
SAM: Oh, there's more people?

01:57:03.792 --> 01:57:08.619
MATT: There's one guy over here by Keyleth who
currently hasn't even noticed what's going on

01:57:08.619 --> 01:57:11.967
because he got hit with lightning twice and is being
attacked by a giant tiger.

01:57:11.967 --> 01:57:22.276
SAM: All right. I guess I'll try to intimidate him
to stop, and I'll say, I'll turn to him and say,

01:57:22.276 --> 01:57:35.409
you there! Idiot! (stutters) You're not going to
win! You should not fight anymore! Because you're

01:57:35.409 --> 01:57:38.924
going to die. And that's it, that's all I got.

01:57:38.924 --> 01:57:40.789
MATT: Okay, roll intimidation check.

01:57:40.789 --> 01:57:42.952
LAURA: Worst intimidation ever.

01:57:42.952 --> 01:57:45.527
SAM: 22.

01:57:45.527 --> 01:57:51.883
MATT: And yet the conviction behind the words--
the heart behind each stuttered moment of that

01:57:51.883 --> 01:57:53.046
sentence--

01:57:53.046 --> 01:57:57.872
SAM: You know what, I'll sing to him to intimidate
him, would that help?

01:57:57.872 --> 01:57:59.315
MATT: If you want to, go for it.

01:57:59.315 --> 01:58:05.195
SAM: Sure. I will sing, (singing) Some people call
me a gnome cowboy. Some people call me the

01:58:05.195 --> 01:58:06.426
gangster of love.

01:58:06.426 --> 01:58:08.532
TALIESIN: Nobody calls him the gangster of love.

01:58:08.532 --> 01:58:14.760
SAM: (singing) Some people call me Maurice because
I'm a hitter, I'm a winner, I'm a bedroom shitter.

01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:17.256
(laughter)

01:58:17.256 --> 01:58:20.296
SAM: (singing) Playing my music on my shawm,
oooh.

01:58:20.296 --> 01:58:27.377
MATT: Which, right where the guitar would go
(high-pitched guitar), you hear the clanging of

01:58:27.377 --> 01:58:32.710
weapons to the ground as the other remaining thug
looks around and sees the mess that you've made of

01:58:32.710 --> 01:58:37.186
all of his various compadres and immediately drops
to the ground, hand over his head, going:

01:58:37.186 --> 01:58:39.200
"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!"

01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:43.508
LAURA: We shouldn't have taken him hostage. I
wanted to just kill him.

01:58:43.508 --> 01:58:44.810
TRAVIS: Oh, don't worry.

01:58:44.810 --> 01:58:46.003
JASON: We can still kill him.

01:58:46.003 --> 01:58:50.463
SAM: And as my bonus action, I tell the dwarf to
start collecting all the stuff from all the other

01:58:50.463 --> 01:58:51.561
people as well.

01:58:51.561 --> 01:58:57.290
MATT: "Certainly. Right away." See if he makes his
save. He does not. So he then walks over and

01:58:57.290 --> 01:59:01.001
starts looting the corpses of his friends for you.
(laughs)

01:59:01.001 --> 01:59:03.791
TALIESIN: That's dark. That's dark.

01:59:03.791 --> 01:59:09.653
MATT: All right, so there's the one guy who's on
the ground now, hands over his head.

01:59:09.653 --> 01:59:12.658
TRAVIS: Is he the only one left?

01:59:12.658 --> 01:59:14.599
MATT: He's the only one left.

01:59:14.599 --> 01:59:16.690
LAURA: And the dwarf who is looting things now.

01:59:16.690 --> 01:59:21.528
MARISHA: I stay in Minxie form and stay on him,
growling at him.

01:59:21.528 --> 01:59:23.069
MATT: Okay.

01:59:23.069 --> 01:59:25.708
LAURA: I, actually, you know what? Instead of
looting, I'm going to--

01:59:25.708 --> 01:59:33.402
MATT: Slowly the rain begins to hit as the storm
finally starts coming down, elevated by the druid

01:59:33.402 --> 01:59:37.162
spells that brought the moisture to gather over
this section. You walk over to him.

01:59:37.162 --> 01:59:42.422
LAURA: I'm actually going to start using
perception to look for any sign of Gilmore in the

01:59:42.422 --> 01:59:43.663
rubble or--

01:59:43.663 --> 01:59:46.003
SAM: Gilmore? Use your dragon perception, lady.

01:59:46.003 --> 01:59:49.231
MATT: This would be more of an investigation
check. As you begin to pore over the rubble

01:59:49.231 --> 01:59:50.466
yourself to gather it--

01:59:50.466 --> 01:59:55.790
LAURA: Okay. I leave him to you all.

01:59:55.790 --> 01:59:57.163
TRAVIS: Where's the meat?

01:59:57.163 --> 02:00:00.527
LIAM: It was my turn in initiative, so I want to
walk over to him.

02:00:00.527 --> 02:00:01.703
MATT: Okay.

02:00:01.703 --> 02:00:03.539
LAURA: Natural 20 on investigation.

02:00:03.539 --> 02:00:07.300
MARISHA: Oh, that's going to be good. That's
good.

02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:13.400
MATT: All righty. So you walk over, so as she's
investigating it, you go ahead and you walk over

02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:14.641
to him.

02:00:14.641 --> 02:00:21.644
LIAM: You're coming with me. I lift him up and I'm
leading him off around the corner of a building.

02:00:21.644 --> 02:00:24.297
MARISHA: I pace along as Minxie.

02:00:24.297 --> 02:00:26.564
MATT: Okay. Garthok, you doing anything?

02:00:26.564 --> 02:00:28.520
JASON: I go with them.

02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:34.376
MATT: Okay, so the half-orc saunters up next to
the tiger and you guys disappear around the corner

02:00:34.376 --> 02:00:36.208
of one of the nearby buildings.

02:00:36.208 --> 02:00:38.255
JASON: I just start cleaning my spear in front of
him.

02:00:38.255 --> 02:00:39.753
MATT: Okay.

02:00:39.753 --> 02:00:42.979
MARISHA: I pace around.

02:00:42.979 --> 02:00:44.615
MATT: All right, you lead him and you slam him up
against the wall.

02:00:44.615 --> 02:00:47.598
MATT: "Look, look, what do you want?"

02:00:47.598 --> 02:00:50.671
LIAM: Nothing.

02:00:50.671 --> 02:00:52.326
SAM: Oh, you knocking him out?

02:00:52.326 --> 02:00:55.314
MATT: Whack, you take him off the side of the head
and he crumples into a pile there in the alley.

02:00:55.314 --> 02:01:02.733
LIAM: Pick up some shit from the ground and prop
it up against him, a couple of pieces, not bury

02:01:02.733 --> 02:01:04.258
him, just hide him a bit.

02:01:04.258 --> 02:01:05.521
MATT: Okay.

02:01:05.521 --> 02:01:09.182
LIAM: And then I walk back to the group and I
start picking shit up around where my

02:01:09.182 --> 02:01:10.339
sister is.

02:01:10.339 --> 02:01:13.766
MARISHA: I go back, I guess. I was useful.

02:01:13.766 --> 02:01:15.309
JASON: I thought we were going to interrogate
him.

02:01:15.309 --> 02:01:19.765
MARISHA: Me, too. (laughs) I came along as
intimidation.

02:01:19.765 --> 02:01:21.081
LIAM: Looters?

02:01:21.081 --> 02:01:24.825
MARISHA: But he was bringing stuff back and forth
to--

02:01:24.825 --> 02:01:30.379
LAURA: Well, he's still there. And we do have a
dwarf that's mind-controlled right now. That is

02:01:30.379 --> 02:01:31.679
probably the best.

02:01:31.679 --> 02:01:34.354
MATT: Who is currently looting the bodies.

02:01:34.354 --> 02:01:38.005
LAURA: Don't touch anything. I'm investigating.

02:01:38.005 --> 02:01:44.562
MATT: As you are going through the rubble, you can
see a lot of the rubble has been moved over, and

02:01:44.562 --> 02:01:49.663
you see remnants of shattered glass cases and
shelves and a lot of the things that you had

02:01:49.663 --> 02:01:55.233
previously seen within Gilmore's Glorious Goods,
largely picked over and left behind. Many books

02:01:55.233 --> 02:02:00.447
lie tattered and burned and destroyed as part of
the attack. You get the sense here that most

02:02:00.447 --> 02:02:06.335
anything that was of use or worth has been taken
already and what the people here were gathering,

02:02:06.335 --> 02:02:09.859
they mentioned this was their third time back,
they were basically picking up what remnants they

02:02:09.859 --> 02:02:15.211
could, which were pieces of broken objects,
elements of gold that were left behind, but most

02:02:15.211 --> 02:02:19.060
of the contents of the store have been ransacked
and taken.

02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:24.132
SAM: Can I specifically look for the beaded
curtain he emerges from?

02:02:24.132 --> 02:02:29.651
MATT: Yes, actually. And as you guys go toward the
beaded curtain, it's torn apart and under a big

02:02:29.651 --> 02:02:34.428
piece of rock. You push aside and, with the help
of Grog and a few other individuals, you guys move

02:02:34.428 --> 02:02:41.531
some of the rocks out of the way to where the
bedroom is, and it's completely destroyed. There's

02:02:41.531 --> 02:02:48.059
no sign of Gilmore or anybody else here, and as
the rain's starting to come down a little heavier,

02:02:48.059 --> 02:02:56.505
you all get that sense of horror washing over you.
Vex, you notice, looking underneath where the

02:02:56.505 --> 02:03:04.911
shattered remains of the foot of his bed are,
there is a smooth piece of stone with a handle.

02:03:04.911 --> 02:03:07.767
SAM: And a barrel of lube.

02:03:07.767 --> 02:03:11.098
LAURA: I rush over to it.

02:03:11.098 --> 02:03:12.428
MATT: Okay.

02:03:12.428 --> 02:03:15.080
LAURA: Can I detect traps now?

02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:19.446
MATT: I mean, you could technically detect traps
whenever you wanted to try.

02:03:19.446 --> 02:03:20.480
LAURA: Oh.

02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:25.130
MATT: You have to have sight for it. If you want
to, go ahead and make a perception check.

02:03:25.130 --> 02:03:30.113
LAURA: 26.

02:03:30.113 --> 02:03:35.303
MATT: 26. You take a moment to inspect it. You
follow the edge, and yes, it is indeed a false

02:03:35.303 --> 02:03:42.825
door made of this stone tile that comprises the
floor of the room, and it is a hatch. It is not trapped.

02:03:42.825 --> 02:03:45.342
LAURA: I start pushing on the bed and call for
Grog and say, help me with this!

02:03:45.342 --> 02:03:48.528
TRAVIS: What? Oh! Run over. I help.

02:03:48.528 --> 02:03:49.936
LAURA: There's a door.

02:03:49.936 --> 02:03:51.786
LIAM: I hear her yelling and wander up as well.

02:03:51.786 --> 02:03:52.687
MATT: Okay.

02:03:52.687 --> 02:03:54.530
MARISHA: Still in Minxie, pace over.

02:03:54.530 --> 02:03:58.717
MATT: The dwarf comes running up with you guys as
well, still--

02:03:58.717 --> 02:04:01.797
LAURA: Did he get everything? I mean, did he loot
everything, are we--?

02:04:01.797 --> 02:04:10.167
MATT: He comes up with all the various coin purses
which, interestingly enough, are mostly empty

02:04:10.167 --> 02:04:14.214
other than a few copper. It seems like whatever
they've stolen is not on them currently.

02:04:14.214 --> 02:04:15.808
SAM: They gave it to the dragon.

02:04:15.808 --> 02:04:17.037
LAURA: Assholes.

02:04:17.037 --> 02:04:18.341
TRAVIS: They gave it to &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.

02:04:18.341 --> 02:04:19.510
LAURA: The dragon.

02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:21.527
SAM: Him. Whatever that is.

02:04:21.527 --> 02:04:22.620
TRAVIS: Did we ask?

02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:23.522
SAM: No.

02:04:23.522 --> 02:04:25.591
LIAM: You've got a happy dwarf standing--

02:04:25.591 --> 02:04:27.371
SAM: Oi, dwarf.

02:04:27.371 --> 02:04:28.598
MATT: "Aye."

02:04:28.598 --> 02:04:33.860
SAM: Who have you been collecting swag for?

02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:35.163
MATT: "The dragon."

02:04:35.163 --> 02:04:36.161
SAM: Okay.

02:04:36.161 --> 02:04:38.280
(laughter)

02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:43.935
MATT: "As long as we give him what's important and
what's worth, he'll keep us alive. Even protect us."

02:04:43.935 --> 02:04:46.275
SAM: He told you this?

02:04:46.275 --> 02:04:47.689
ASHLEY: Where are you taking it to?

02:04:47.689 --> 02:04:54.857
MATT: "To the center of town. Which I've never
been before, the Cloudtop itself. What stands is

02:04:54.857 --> 02:04:56.172
"very pretty."

02:04:56.172 --> 02:04:58.395
SAM: The gates to it are open?

02:04:58.395 --> 02:04:59.501
MATT: "Aye."

02:04:59.501 --> 02:05:07.103
SAM: And the dragon sits there in the open,
collecting his bounty?

02:05:07.103 --> 02:05:09.521
MATT: "There's lines, folks lined up bringing all
they have to him."

02:05:09.521 --> 02:05:15.217
JASON: So if this is your third trip back, the
first two, you already took it to him or did

02:05:15.217 --> 02:05:17.805
you take it somewhere else to store?

02:05:17.805 --> 02:05:20.195
MATT: "Well, we've put it all in a place so that
then we can take it to him."

02:05:20.195 --> 02:05:21.537
JASON: Take us to that place.

02:05:21.537 --> 02:05:23.673
MATT: "All right." And he turns around and starts
walking away.

02:05:23.673 --> 02:05:24.940
JASON: Sorry.

02:05:24.940 --> 02:05:26.166
SAM: No, that's fine.

02:05:26.166 --> 02:05:27.657
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, not yet!

02:05:27.657 --> 02:05:33.567
LAURA: But wait, tell us where it is, how about
that? How about you tell us where it is. Right now.

02:05:33.567 --> 02:05:35.103
MATT: "Certainly."

02:05:35.103 --> 02:05:44.042
MATT: And he explains about a 15-minute walk from
here there is a well that is in between four

02:05:44.042 --> 02:05:48.399
buildings in an alley cross-section. All of it's
been actually put into the well, which has been

02:05:48.399 --> 02:05:53.647
hollowed out, or all the water's been repressed
with dirt, and it's been filled with everything

02:05:53.647 --> 02:05:55.849
they've gathered.

02:05:55.849 --> 02:06:01.504
LAURA: He's going to save eventually. He's going
to break your mind control. Maybe we should knock

02:06:01.504 --> 02:06:02.891
him out right now.

02:06:02.891 --> 02:06:04.099
TRAVIS: Knock him out, or--?

02:06:04.099 --> 02:06:06.532
MATT: At which point, he turns around going,
"Ugh."

02:06:06.532 --> 02:06:07.864
LAURA: Knock him out!

02:06:07.864 --> 02:06:16.640
MATT: You know what, go ahead and roll an attack.
It's going to be surprise because he currently is

02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:19.007
not aware of the situation, so it's auto-crit.

02:06:19.007 --> 02:06:22.436
LIAM: Oh, advantage, all right. Well, that's
better. 22.

02:06:22.436 --> 02:06:24.315
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Go ahead and roll.

02:06:24.315 --> 02:06:41.555
LIAM: Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's a 13, 16,
that's still spinning, (counting), 26. 26 total.

02:06:41.555 --> 02:06:47.998
MATT: Did you double that from the surprise?
Because he wasn't even prepared.

02:06:47.998 --> 02:06:49.927
LIAM: No, so, uh, okay, so--

02:06:49.927 --> 02:06:52.346
MATT: It's enough, if you double it. As long as
you're over 40, he's down.

02:06:52.346 --> 02:06:53.571
LIAM: Yeah, it would be 40-something.

02:06:53.571 --> 02:06:57.427
MATT: Yeah, so. He goes out. A little dwarven
pile. He's out.

02:06:57.427 --> 02:07:01.074
LAURA: Tie him up. I don't want him waking up and
running back to the dragon.

02:07:01.074 --> 02:07:02.468
TRAVIS: You know how you solve that?

02:07:02.468 --> 02:07:06.076
LAURA: I understand that, Grog. Maybe we should
just tie him up.

02:07:06.076 --> 02:07:07.039
SAM: Tie him up.

02:07:07.039 --> 02:07:08.270
MATT: Okay.

02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:12.790
LAURA: Tie him up and tie him up to a big stone so
he can't get up and run even if he--

02:07:12.790 --> 02:07:14.733
MATT: Okay, so you guys take a moment to go ahead
and--

02:07:14.733 --> 02:07:16.950
TALIESIN: Bow. Tie him in a little bow.

02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:21.858
MATT: Little bow, little dwarven bow? Okay. You
find a large piece of broken stone that was part

02:07:21.858 --> 02:07:26.430
of the building's base floor structure and you tie
it around in multiple ways where he's going to

02:07:26.430 --> 02:07:31.014
have a hard time getting out, especially in his
current mindspace when he comes to consciousness.

02:07:31.014 --> 02:07:33.014
The rain's still pouring down. He's soaked.

02:07:33.014 --> 02:07:35.788
LAURA: Now.

02:07:35.788 --> 02:07:44.279
MATT: All right. You guys gather around the hidden
hatch in the floor of Gilmore's room, and we're

02:07:44.279 --> 02:07:45.864
going to go ahead and take a quick bathroom
break.

02:07:45.864 --> 02:07:47.128
ALL: Oh!

02:07:47.128 --> 02:07:50.960
MATT: (laughs) A quick one. We'll take a few
minutes, get right back into this because we do

02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:55.321
have Critmas tonight. We want to make sure we get
as much done before we have to leave. So let's do

02:07:55.321 --> 02:07:57.552
this. See you guys in a minute.

02:07:57.552 --> 02:19:01.022
[break]

02:19:01.022 --> 02:19:08.615
MATT: Welcome back everyone! So, as Liam here
brings up our wondrous Pike, we'll go ahead and

02:19:08.615 --> 02:19:11.661
hop back into the game in just a minute, but I did
want to say two things. One, we have this

02:19:11.661 --> 02:19:17.889
evening's winner for our giveaway, so a big
congratulations to one of my favorite recent

02:19:17.889 --> 02:19:21.071
chatroom names: congrats to JarFullOfFarts.

02:19:21.071 --> 02:19:23.609
(laughter)

02:19:23.609 --> 02:19:27.513
MATT: You are our giveaway winner. I love you,
Internet, for allowing me to say these sentences.

02:19:27.513 --> 02:19:29.112
It's a wonderful experience.

02:19:29.112 --> 02:19:30.999
TRAVIS: Jar full of farts!

02:19:30.999 --> 02:19:36.015
MATT: Also, I want to give a shout-out to a friend
of the show who's been helping stream on their end

02:19:36.015 --> 02:19:40.584
as well, hosting us on their channel, and we've
had a good back-and-forth. "Rated E with Elspeth"

02:19:40.584 --> 02:19:43.622
has been a really awesome supporter of the show.
Go check her out, give her a follow if you have

02:19:43.622 --> 02:19:49.627
the opportunity. Thank you very much, by the way,
for helping support us. So, yay! All right, so!

02:19:49.627 --> 02:19:55.176
Getting back in here. As the rain now continues to
pour down from above the open, clouded sky of

02:19:55.176 --> 02:20:06.734
Emon, you reach down and pull open the false latch
on top of this open, hidden compartment beneath

02:20:06.734 --> 02:20:15.438
the remnants of Gilmore's room. You look down into
a dark, low-lit interior, and what appears to be a

02:20:15.438 --> 02:20:22.816
figure who rushes up very, very quickly and stops.
And you hear a voice from within the darkness,

02:20:22.816 --> 02:20:29.532
just out of view from your position, that says,
"Whoever you are, leave! Run away or I swear I'll

02:20:29.532 --> 02:20:31.100
"kill you!"

02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:32.232
MARISHA: Sherri.

02:20:32.232 --> 02:20:33.405
LAURA: Sherri?

02:20:33.405 --> 02:20:39.813
MATT: You look down and it doesn't appear to be
Sherri. It's a woman, frazzled hair. You can't

02:20:39.813 --> 02:20:43.193
make out the details of her expression, but she's
holding this blade in front.

02:20:43.193 --> 02:20:44.608
LAURA: Don't attack!

02:20:44.608 --> 02:20:46.427
SAM: Sherri, it's us!

02:20:46.427 --> 02:20:49.544
LAURA: Did you work here? We're looking for
Gilmore.

02:20:49.544 --> 02:20:53.284
MATT: Looks past her shoulder. "Sherri?"

02:20:53.284 --> 02:21:00.825
MATT: And you see Sherri now approaches, her hair
frazzled. She looks like she's covered in soot,

02:21:00.825 --> 02:21:07.972
and actually has suffered some minor burns on part
of her arm and the side of her face a little bit,

02:21:07.972 --> 02:21:13.439
and she steps into the little bit of light at the
bottom of the shaft and looks up and goes, "My

02:21:13.439 --> 02:21:20.667
"god. Come in, quick. Please." And she ushers you
down into this area.

02:21:20.667 --> 02:21:22.134
MARISHA: I drop Minxie form.

02:21:22.134 --> 02:21:28.858
MATT: Okay. As you guys all head down inside, this
is a relatively small chamber, maybe 20 feet by 20

02:21:28.858 --> 02:21:36.175
feet. There's a couple of small chairs, and there
are a few metal rods that are bolted into the

02:21:36.175 --> 02:21:40.765
stonework leading down as a ladder that you can
climb down. This is obviously a hidden compartment

02:21:40.765 --> 02:21:48.433
that Gilmore uses to go up and down. You get a
better view now. It is Sherri there. Trinket,

02:21:48.433 --> 02:21:54.452
unfortunately, at this moment, cannot make his way
down into this, so looks at you (bear grunts).

02:21:54.452 --> 02:21:56.608
Looks around--

02:21:56.608 --> 02:22:00.194
LAURA: Stay and guard the unconscious fucks.

02:22:00.194 --> 02:22:03.867
MATT: (bear grunts) and sets into a defensive
position now looking out at the rest.

02:22:03.867 --> 02:22:09.309
LAURA: If they start to wake up, sit on them! Or
kill them, if necessary.

02:22:09.309 --> 02:22:12.772
MATT: Gives a nod, and stands there in the pouring
rain, soaking through Trinket. The armor

02:22:12.772 --> 02:22:18.086
ting-ting-ting-ting-ting, ting-ing off the armor.
Staying there, keeping guard. As you all climb

02:22:18.086 --> 02:22:25.859
down, you notice next to Sherri a very frazzled
and harrowed-looking-- the woman who was holding

02:22:25.859 --> 02:22:32.269
the dagger in front. Her clothing is very, very
nice, though currently torn, and filthy. This is

02:22:32.269 --> 02:22:34.256
Empress Salda Tal'Dorei.

02:22:34.256 --> 02:22:35.605
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

02:22:35.605 --> 02:22:36.963
SAM: Wait, what, who?

02:22:36.963 --> 02:22:39.032
MATT: Empress Salda Tal'Dorei, the wife of Uriel.

02:22:39.032 --> 02:22:44.098
LAURA: Empress! Is Uriel down here? Did you make
it out? The children!

02:22:44.098 --> 02:22:48.930
MATT: She puts her blade away. She looks over her
shoulder. "The children--" She puts her hand to

02:22:48.930 --> 02:22:53.565
the side and you can see in the back room, which,
now you can see, there is a teleportation circle

02:22:53.565 --> 02:22:58.161
that is slowly lit on the bottom of the floor
within this room.

02:22:58.161 --> 02:23:00.408
MARISHA: What was her first name again? Empress
what?

02:23:00.408 --> 02:23:01.366
MATT: Salda.

02:23:01.366 --> 02:23:02.845
MARISHA: Esalda? With an E?

02:23:02.845 --> 02:23:11.866
MATT: Salda. S-A-L-D-A. She looks over and you can
see her three kids, Odessa, Illya, and Gren, two

02:23:11.866 --> 02:23:18.494
daughters and son, are all sitting in the corner,
talking to each other. They look like how children

02:23:18.494 --> 02:23:22.092
deal in these type of situations. They're talking
and playing games and trying to distract

02:23:22.092 --> 02:23:27.316
themselves. But as soon as you guys all walk in,
they look over, quietly, and their faces brighten

02:23:27.316 --> 02:23:31.603
up at the arrival of somebody new, and they
recognize you as you begin to step into the low

02:23:31.603 --> 02:23:41.481
light of the chamber. Salda then puts her hand
down and says, "I don't believe my husband made

02:23:41.481 --> 02:23:47.413
"it. But we're alive."

02:23:47.413 --> 02:23:49.694
LIAM: Did you see him fall?

02:23:49.694 --> 02:23:59.177
MATT: "No." And she looks over into the far
corner. You can see, amongst the pile of rags and

02:23:59.177 --> 02:24:05.682
stuff, there is one long pile of dark, crushed
velvet blue in the corner, with a small puddle of

02:24:05.682 --> 02:24:13.767
crimson under it. "He saved us." And, glancing
over in the corner, you can now see the shape of

02:24:13.767 --> 02:24:22.110
Gilmore, slumped in the corner, arm draped over
his midsection, head down to the side, in the

02:24:22.110 --> 02:24:23.560
center of that pool.

02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:27.919
LIAM: I run over, I run over. Is he awake? Is he
alive? I've got my hand under his chin. Is he alive?

02:24:27.919 --> 02:24:40.724
MATT: You reach over and touch Gilmore's face, and
it is cold with sweat, but it's feverish sweat.

02:24:40.724 --> 02:24:45.852
There is a very, very strong fever in his body,
and there's beads of sweat down the face, and as

02:24:45.852 --> 02:24:50.671
you look down you can see where the arm is holding
there is blood soaked into the robe. You can see

02:24:50.671 --> 02:24:58.313
parts of the robe right now are currently--
elements of it are burned and charred. You can see

02:24:58.313 --> 02:25:03.248
parts of it scraped away. Gilmore's looking pretty
rough.

02:25:03.248 --> 02:25:05.633
LIAM: I pull him in. Pike, Pike, Pike! Keyleth!
Come over here!

02:25:05.633 --> 02:25:07.088
MATT: Pike, what are you doing?

02:25:07.088 --> 02:25:09.902
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to Cure Wounds.

02:25:09.902 --> 02:25:15.991
LIAM: It's going to be all right. Pike is here,
it's going to be all right, it's going to be all

02:25:15.991 --> 02:25:23.717
right. Gil? Is there any consciousness?

02:25:23.717 --> 02:25:27.141
MARISHA: I mean, I can try and assist you, Pike,
with Cure Wounds. That's all I have right now.

02:25:27.141 --> 02:25:31.177
ASHLEY: Okay. Yeah, is he conscious?

02:25:31.177 --> 02:25:36.414
MATT: No, unconscious. Unconscious, and looking--

02:25:36.414 --> 02:25:37.978
MARISHA: Fading fast?

02:25:37.978 --> 02:25:41.156
LAURA: Can you, like, Greater Restoration? I mean,
what's the best cure you can do, Pike?

02:25:41.156 --> 02:25:43.030
ASHLEY: Okay okay okay.

02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:47.111
MATT: You guys can both make medicine checks to
try and put him in a position where he would be

02:25:47.111 --> 02:25:49.587
more susceptible to healing.

02:25:49.587 --> 02:25:51.371
LAURA: 22?

02:25:51.371 --> 02:25:54.310
ASHLEY: I can use a sixth level, and Heal.

02:25:54.310 --> 02:25:56.153
MATT: Use the spell Heal?

02:25:56.153 --> 02:25:57.282
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:25:57.282 --> 02:26:00.044
MARISHA: And I did a 16 on my Medicine check, with
her 22.

02:26:00.044 --> 02:26:07.311
MATT: Okay. So you guys take a moment, you dress
the wounds best you can, and put him in a position

02:26:07.311 --> 02:26:13.533
where Pike, as you bring forward, you grab your
holy symbol, and clutching it between both your

02:26:13.533 --> 02:26:21.577
hands very tightly, you kneel down in front of the
slowly fading body of Gilmore. You can see the

02:26:21.577 --> 02:26:26.030
shiver occasionally, instinctually in his
unconsciousness, and you reach out and touch him,

02:26:26.030 --> 02:26:32.628
and as you do, the warm light of Sarenrae fills
your torso, travels through your arms, and into

02:26:32.628 --> 02:26:38.075
the body of Gilmore. His arms fall to his side,
limp, as the warmth swells up into the torso, and

02:26:38.075 --> 02:26:43.644
for a second, as the outside of the robe that you
saw torn open opens up, you can see now the

02:26:43.644 --> 02:26:51.384
hideous gash that has currently torn through his
abdomen. As the warmth spreads through the body,

02:26:51.384 --> 02:26:59.563
and the light visually shows the horrible, jagged
nature of this wound, the wound stitches itself up

02:26:59.563 --> 02:27:07.280
and you can see it close, leaving but the tiniest
of scar across. The blood itself all still caked

02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:12.086
into the material, but the wound is now closed. As
you pull your hands back, you can see Gilmore's

02:27:12.086 --> 02:27:16.355
body, which has, from the sheer power of the Heal
spell, has actually been elevated a few inches off

02:27:16.355 --> 02:27:21.513
the ground, and then clatters to the ground as the
spell finishes, and you can see he shivers for a

02:27:21.513 --> 02:27:25.872
second, he curls over. (pained grunt)

02:27:25.872 --> 02:27:28.437
LIAM: I pull him into my lap, and hold onto him.

02:27:28.437 --> 02:27:36.599
MATT: At this point, Sherri instinctively goes,
"Is he all right? Is he all right?" She pulls out

02:27:36.599 --> 02:27:38.005
her glasses, puts them on.

02:27:38.005 --> 02:27:40.849
LIAM: I think so, I think so.

02:27:40.849 --> 02:27:43.243
MATT: "Who's this one? What is he doing here?"

02:27:43.243 --> 02:27:48.985
SAM: He's a friend, he fought with us. He's not
corrupted by the dragon's influence.

02:27:48.985 --> 02:27:52.615
MATT: "I'd like to know your name, orcish sir."

02:27:52.615 --> 02:27:54.271
SAM: It's really cool.

02:27:54.271 --> 02:27:58.652
JASON: I'm Garthok. I bow. I bow.

02:27:58.652 --> 02:28:05.445
MATT: She gives you a sideways glance. "Keep your
distance. I don't trust you yet."

02:28:05.445 --> 02:28:12.271
And she turns back around towards Gilmore. As
you're holding him there, the children at this

02:28:12.271 --> 02:28:19.695
point are very quiet and sitting at his foot as
you all gather around this corner. A minute passes

02:28:19.695 --> 02:28:23.385
in silence. Another minute passes.

02:28:23.385 --> 02:28:29.987
LIAM: Smoothing his hair out. Hey. Hey.

02:28:29.987 --> 02:28:35.528
MATT: His body is-- the stillness is maintained,
but you can still feel the heartbeat, and you can

02:28:35.528 --> 02:28:40.181
feel the pulse of blood through the body from
holding the shoulders. And then, from that

02:28:40.181 --> 02:28:48.388
silence, you hear, (weak coughing). And the mouth
opens, and the eyes begin to loll open, and the

02:28:48.388 --> 02:28:58.207
irises begin to try and find some point of focus,
and Gilmore slowly lolls the head back up and

02:28:58.207 --> 02:29:02.563
looks into your face and smiles, instinctually,
little blood at the corner of his mouth, and he

02:29:02.563 --> 02:29:11.560
looks up at you. "Well. That's always what I assumed
I'd see in my last moments." (chuckles)

02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:13.490
LIAM: Bad day, huh?

02:29:13.490 --> 02:29:16.967
MATT: "Ah... strangely enough, I'm pretty sure I've
had worse."

02:29:16.967 --> 02:29:19.406
LAURA: No offense, darling, but you look like
shit.

02:29:19.406 --> 02:29:24.796
MATT: (laughs) "We can't have that, can we?"
(coughs) Lifts his hand and begins to try and cast

02:29:24.796 --> 02:29:29.682
a spell. You can see a bit of arcane
Prestidigitation begin to try and muster, and he

02:29:29.682 --> 02:29:32.783
coughs, and the magic sputters and fades.

02:29:32.783 --> 02:29:34.433
LIAM: Give it time.

02:29:34.433 --> 02:29:47.930
MATT: "So, either we're all dead or we're all
alive. I'd like an answer."

02:29:47.930 --> 02:29:49.306
LAURA: Alive.

02:29:49.306 --> 02:29:55.018
MATT: "Good, I was hoping you'd say that.
(relieved chuckle) I was so worried about you all.

02:29:55.018 --> 02:29:56.965
"I went back for you."

02:29:56.965 --> 02:29:59.092
MARISHA: What? We were so worried about you!

02:29:59.092 --> 02:30:01.437
TALIESIN: We're glad you came here.

02:30:01.437 --> 02:30:10.689
MATT: "I'm sorry. When they attacked, my instinct
was to grab the children. I got who I could, but

02:30:10.689 --> 02:30:20.814
"Uriel pushed me away. He was trying to get others
out of the fray."

02:30:20.814 --> 02:30:22.705
LAURA: Did you see him fall?

02:30:22.705 --> 02:30:27.382
MATT: "I didn't see him fall, but I went back, and
I found him fallen."

02:30:27.382 --> 02:30:31.648
SAM: His body?

02:30:31.648 --> 02:30:43.346
MATT: "What was left of it. I brought back Salda
and the children. I brought back Asum, and that

02:30:43.346 --> 02:30:49.742
"abrasive dragon girl. I don't know where they are
right now."

02:30:49.742 --> 02:30:54.289
And Salda chimes in and goes, "They both actually,
they left. They went topsoil to try and find other

02:30:54.289 --> 02:30:58.840
"survivors. I told them not to, I told them to
stay, but they're assumedly off in the city

02:30:58.840 --> 02:31:01.575
"somewhere, trying to make sense of all this."

02:31:01.575 --> 02:31:05.294
TALIESIN: We're trying to collect people at our
keep.

02:31:05.294 --> 02:31:09.378
MARISHA: We've turned it into a safe haven.

02:31:09.378 --> 02:31:17.436
MATT: "Well. That's kind of you. That's good of
you. That's probably one of the only safe places

02:31:17.436 --> 02:31:20.650
"in the city right now." (coughs)

02:31:20.650 --> 02:31:25.460
LIAM: Can you do anything?

02:31:25.460 --> 02:31:30.126
LAURA: I mean, I can cast Cure Wounds on him to
try to help out at all. Will it help? I mean, you

02:31:30.126 --> 02:31:31.508
know, more than I would.

02:31:31.508 --> 02:31:39.787
MATT: "Whatever your fine angel of Sarenrae did I
think will hold me fine for now." And he smiles

02:31:39.787 --> 02:31:45.818
and gives a very, very half-hearted wink towards
Pike. "Thank you."

02:31:45.818 --> 02:31:49.459
ASHLEY: Welcome.

02:31:49.459 --> 02:31:52.188
MATT: "Thank you dearly."

02:31:52.188 --> 02:31:55.402
LIAM: You've certainly earned your name today.

02:31:55.402 --> 02:32:03.330
MATT: "I could have saved more. I couldn't find
you, I couldn't-- I looked."

02:32:03.330 --> 02:32:05.930
MARISHA: We're so sorry.

02:32:05.930 --> 02:32:08.863
MATT: "Oh, no, I, you-- "

02:32:08.863 --> 02:32:10.518
TALIESIN: We were hard to find.

02:32:10.518 --> 02:32:15.244
MATT: "I figured you would be taking care of
yourself. I went-- (chuckles) I went to the dragon

02:32:15.244 --> 02:32:21.594
"then, just in case you had decided to be your
usual foolish selves and run into hell itself."

02:32:21.594 --> 02:32:26.619
LAURA: Perhaps sent a spy and try to trick him?
(chuckles) That would have been stupid, huh?

02:32:26.619 --> 02:32:30.703
SAM: Yes. Very.

02:32:30.703 --> 02:32:34.653
LAURA: Gilmore, we called for you. I'm sorry we
didn't wait.

02:32:34.653 --> 02:32:39.626
MATT: "No. I'm glad you didn't. You may not be
here."

02:32:39.626 --> 02:32:45.572
LIAM: Did you see any others from the Council?
Anyone else?

02:32:45.572 --> 02:32:55.215
MATT: "Well." And he leans forward, and sits up
out of your lap for a second to look at the rest

02:32:55.215 --> 02:33:15.084
of you. "There are quite a few dead,
unfortunately. Brom Goldhand didn't make it. Most

02:33:15.084 --> 02:33:25.818
"of the guards are gone. Half, if not more, of the
Cloudtop District. Killed by the poisonous fume

02:33:25.818 --> 02:33:30.278
"that took the entire area so suddenly."

02:33:30.278 --> 02:33:33.778
LAURA: Poisonous fume?

02:33:33.778 --> 02:33:44.974
MATT: "From the initial dragon attack. We've been
staying here for safety's sake. I don't know how

02:33:44.974 --> 02:33:53.167
"long I've been out. Could we perhaps make our way
towards your place as well?"

02:33:53.167 --> 02:33:55.534
LAURA: It would be smart.

02:33:55.534 --> 02:34:03.789
SAM: Is there any point to searching for more
Council members or allies before we go?

02:34:03.789 --> 02:34:11.218
LAURA: Anyone that was alive that you saw?

02:34:11.218 --> 02:34:18.725
MATT: "I mean, there were many that were alive by
the time I returned. They were all kneeling before

02:34:18.725 --> 02:34:27.058
"the beast. It's very interesting that when given
the face of death before you how quickly folks are

02:34:27.058 --> 02:34:37.638
"willing to stay alive at whatever cost of morality
and sense of society. I don't blame them. I mean,

02:34:37.638 --> 02:34:43.406
"what other alternative is there, but to stay alive
and hope that others come and save them from this

02:34:43.406 --> 02:34:50.261
"burden?" (coughs) And he coughs up a little blood
and wipes it from his chin.

02:34:50.261 --> 02:35:01.352
LAURA: Does the Cinder King have mind control
abilities, or is he just super impressive?

02:35:01.352 --> 02:35:09.685
MATT: "I think it's more that he's very persuasive
with his threat of how many did not fare this

02:35:09.685 --> 02:35:18.979
"attack. I did get a good look at him, before
he-- well."

02:35:18.979 --> 02:35:25.670
LIAM: He's ripped the heart out of this city.
Let's go.

02:35:25.816 --> 02:35:27.696
MARISHA: Everything's gone.

02:35:27.759 --> 02:35:30.205
SAM: When you saw him, did you see anything
important?

02:35:30.205 --> 02:35:43.226
MATT: "I did notice in his chest, where the scales
of a dragon usually are uniform, there was an

02:35:43.226 --> 02:35:54.905
"obfuscation of sorts, there was something
different about his armor. It was hard to make out

02:35:54.905 --> 02:36:01.922
"the details in how fast we had a duel. I've never
dueled a dragon before! I've dueled a dragon now."

02:36:01.922 --> 02:36:03.390
(laughs)

02:36:03.390 --> 02:36:05.416
LAURA: And fared quite well!

02:36:05.416 --> 02:36:09.348
MATT: "No, I did not! I survived longer than I
hoped, and got out when I could."

02:36:09.348 --> 02:36:11.507
JASON: A weak spot.

02:36:11.507 --> 02:36:14.906
SAM: Yeah, did it look like scarring? From a
previous fight?

02:36:14.906 --> 02:36:25.032
MATT: "I didn't get a very good look, but it
looked like there was a different material,

02:36:25.032 --> 02:36:30.613
"something smooth and jagged. Something that pulsed
with power."

02:36:30.613 --> 02:36:34.951
LIAM: Doesn't sound like a weak spot.

02:36:34.951 --> 02:36:36.723
LAURA: That doesn't sound super good.

02:36:36.723 --> 02:36:41.562
MATT: "I didn't get a terribly good look, nor do I
understand the nature of whatever it was, but--"

02:36:41.562 --> 02:36:48.086
TALIESIN: It's the beginning of something.
Something to start thinking about.

02:36:48.086 --> 02:36:49.424
MARISHA: What do you mean?

02:36:49.424 --> 02:36:55.732
MATT: "Does anyone have any water? I'm a bit
parched."

02:36:55.732 --> 02:36:59.794
TRAVIS: We got better than that, we got a potion.
And honestly, if we're going to be moving about on

02:36:59.794 --> 02:37:03.979
the streets, I'd like you to not fall open like a
can of baked beans, if you don't mind.

02:37:03.979 --> 02:37:16.293
MATT: (chuckles) "I'm not going to lie, I'm quite
touched by your concern, Grog. It's flattering."

02:37:16.293 --> 02:37:20.695
(grunts) And he starts trying to stand up, and as
he does, Sherri rushes forward and grabs him.

02:37:20.695 --> 02:37:22.635
LIAM: I'm under, too, I'm helping him up.

02:37:22.635 --> 02:37:27.607
MATT: You get him up, and he's propping himself
up. What little strength he has, he's keeping

02:37:27.607 --> 02:37:33.647
himself up, and keeping a smile through it all.
Even in this weakened state, still trying to

02:37:33.647 --> 02:37:38.330
present the best of himself that he can. "All
right."

02:37:38.330 --> 02:37:48.466
SAM: Gilmore, before we go, one more crazy
question: you're not a dragon, are you?

02:37:48.466 --> 02:37:59.197
MATT: (laughs) "Oh, I wish I was. That would have
made this whole endeavor a little easier on my part."

02:37:59.197 --> 02:38:02.178
SAM: All right.

02:38:02.178 --> 02:38:06.812
MATT: "But if you find a way for me to become a
dragon, that would be sexy."

02:38:06.812 --> 02:38:10.331
(laughter)

02:38:10.331 --> 02:38:14.654
ASHLEY: Oh, Gilmore.

02:38:14.654 --> 02:38:17.633
SAM: Should we teleport, or is there tunnels, or
how do we go?

02:38:17.633 --> 02:38:22.379
LAURA: Could I have just a little bit of time?
Before we--

02:38:22.379 --> 02:38:26.717
SAM: Oh, with Garthok? Or with Gilmore?

02:38:26.717 --> 02:38:29.698
LAURA: Oh, up top. You know, I'll be right back.

02:38:29.698 --> 02:38:31.208
SAM: You're going to go up there?

02:38:31.208 --> 02:38:32.774
LAURA: Just for a second.

02:38:32.774 --> 02:38:34.028
TRAVIS: All by yourself?

02:38:34.028 --> 02:38:36.817
LAURA: I mean, if you guys want to join, if
anybody wants to come with me, but I'm going to

02:38:36.817 --> 02:38:38.121
stealth like a motherfucker.

02:38:38.121 --> 02:38:41.222
MARISHA: I mean, it seemed like we were heading
out? Are we heading out?

02:38:41.222 --> 02:38:48.217
TALIESIN: I propose a plan. Let's get them back to
the secret passage. I think we should--

02:38:48.217 --> 02:38:51.850
[no audio]

02:38:51.850 --> 02:39:02.258
TALIESIN: One of the reasons why a government
allows something like the Clasp to exist in a city

02:39:02.258 --> 02:39:09.881
like this is because it is a shadow infrastructure
that will survive an attack like this. It is an

02:39:09.881 --> 02:39:18.573
infrastructure designed-- Grog, it's a bunch of
people who are really good at making money when

02:39:18.573 --> 02:39:22.399
everything's working, and when everything stops
working, they get very angry and want to make

02:39:22.399 --> 02:39:23.786
everything work again.

02:39:23.786 --> 02:39:25.395
TRAVIS: Yeah, I understand that.

02:39:25.395 --> 02:39:33.395
TALIESIN: So we have a group of people who are
well-organized, with everything to gain by this

02:39:33.395 --> 02:39:37.763
dragon leaving. They're ready, they're prepared,
they're probably more prepared than anybody else

02:39:37.763 --> 02:39:45.687
would be. And they might be willing to help us.
They have tunnels, they have men, they have spies,

02:39:45.687 --> 02:39:49.702
they have everything we need. Please tell me if
I'm wrong here.

02:39:49.702 --> 02:39:52.983
JASON: You couldn't be more right.

02:39:52.983 --> 02:39:56.431
TALIESIN: They might be the friends that we need
at this moment.

02:39:56.431 --> 02:40:00.508
MATT: "I take it you're one of these underlings?"

02:40:00.508 --> 02:40:05.515
JASON: I can't speak for the group, but I am a
member, yes.

02:40:05.515 --> 02:40:07.040
LAURA: Would they listen to you?

02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:09.562
JASON: I'm sure they would.

02:40:09.562 --> 02:40:11.351
LAURA: They don't like us very much.

02:40:11.351 --> 02:40:19.343
JASON: A lot of us didn't like Mordeth either, so
more people like you than you may know.

02:40:19.343 --> 02:40:21.415
LAURA: All right.

02:40:21.415 --> 02:40:23.838
TRAVIS: Where do you want to go?

02:40:23.838 --> 02:40:30.279
LAURA: I want to go get that fucking well full of
fucking loot. Magical items, gold, who knows what

02:40:30.279 --> 02:40:31.557
could be in there that could help us?

02:40:31.557 --> 02:40:34.713
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, you want to go steal
from Thordak?

02:40:34.713 --> 02:40:40.526
LAURA: No no no! They never gave it to him. They
gathered a bunch of shit and they hid it in a well.

02:40:40.526 --> 02:40:43.714
SAM: Because he told them to.

02:40:43.714 --> 02:40:47.879
LAURA: No, they were going to get it all together
and give it to him, but they never gave it to him.

02:40:47.879 --> 02:40:50.059
TRAVIS: They were keeping it. They were hiding it
away in one place.

02:40:50.059 --> 02:40:55.062
TALIESIN: So, a small group goes and gets the gold
and the rest of us get Gilmore and the family to

02:40:55.062 --> 02:40:56.245
the secret passage.

02:40:56.245 --> 02:41:00.020
SAM: Last time we took a dragon's gold, five of
them showed up.

02:41:00.020 --> 02:41:02.031
LAURA: The dragon doesn't know about the gold.

02:41:02.031 --> 02:41:09.377
SAM: Don't you think the dragon knows everything
that's going on right now? I'm the spy here.

02:41:09.377 --> 02:41:14.011
LAURA: If you're scared, then go with Gilmore. I'm
going to go get the gold.

02:41:14.011 --> 02:41:16.334
TALIESIN: I would agree with getting the gold.

02:41:16.334 --> 02:41:18.860
LAURA: Grog?

02:41:18.860 --> 02:41:20.419
TRAVIS: I'll go with the family.

02:41:20.419 --> 02:41:24.156
LAURA: Gimme the Bag of Holding, then. Where am I
going to put all the gold?

02:41:24.156 --> 02:41:25.747
TALIESIN: She's got a point.

02:41:25.747 --> 02:41:29.549
MARISHA: Do you all remember the last time I told
you something was a terrible idea?

02:41:29.549 --> 02:41:31.591
LAURA: I've got the Bag of Holding.

02:41:31.591 --> 02:41:32.920
MARISHA: It was a few days ago--

02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:33.919
SAM: It was every time.

02:41:33.919 --> 02:41:35.441
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's all the time, really.

02:41:35.441 --> 02:41:39.215
MARISHA: Right, right. This is probably another
one of those times.

02:41:39.215 --> 02:41:43.418
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on myself and
anybody else joining me?

02:41:43.418 --> 02:41:44.519
SAM: I'm coming too.

02:41:44.519 --> 02:41:45.471
LAURA: Scanlan.

02:41:45.471 --> 02:41:46.447
TRAVIS: Vax?

02:41:46.447 --> 02:41:48.473
TALIESIN: I'll come-- wait, no, I should probably
go.

02:41:48.473 --> 02:41:57.883
LIAM: I don't want to go, but I'm not leaving you.
And I hoist Gilmore onto Keyleth.

02:41:57.883 --> 02:42:00.056
MATT: "Ah."

02:42:00.056 --> 02:42:01.536
TALIESIN: We've got you.

02:42:01.536 --> 02:42:03.695
MATT: "Hello." (chuckles)

02:42:03.695 --> 02:42:05.084
MARISHA: Vax.

02:42:05.084 --> 02:42:06.328
LIAM: I'm not happy.

02:42:06.328 --> 02:42:09.291
LAURA: Well, then, don't be pissy about it.

02:42:09.291 --> 02:42:11.252
LIAM: I'm not leaving you.

02:42:11.252 --> 02:42:19.902
LAURA: We'll be right back. I mean, it's magic
shit! Gilmore, I'm going to get your shit back for you.

02:42:19.902 --> 02:42:24.056
MARISHA: Remember the last time we went somewhere
to go get a big pile of shit?

02:42:24.056 --> 02:42:31.807
MATT: "Good thing, because, well. I'm going to
need it to renovate this place a little." (laughs, coughs)

02:42:31.807 --> 02:42:33.028
LAURA: Right?

02:42:33.028 --> 02:42:34.222
TRAVIS: He's a fan of it.

02:42:34.222 --> 02:42:36.098
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace on the three of us.
Stealth like a motherfucker.

02:42:36.098 --> 02:42:37.228
SAM: Who's three? Us three?

02:42:37.228 --> 02:42:40.205
LAURA: Yeah. Us three. Stealth out. It's like a
15-minute walk.

02:42:40.205 --> 02:42:47.445
MARISHA: We were flanked here at Gilmore's Goods.
What makes you think that they're not going to

02:42:47.445 --> 02:42:49.920
have a ton of people sitting there watching that
well?

02:42:49.920 --> 02:42:52.012
LAURA: I'm going to look out for that shit this
time.

02:42:52.012 --> 02:42:56.052
MARISHA: Yeah, that, right. That's worked well in
the past.

02:42:56.052 --> 02:43:00.892
JASON: The area where they're going, where the
well is. Is that closer to one of the entrances to

02:43:00.892 --> 02:43:02.137
the Clasp?

02:43:02.137 --> 02:43:05.402
MATT: The one you're going towards? In the
direction. It's a little bit past where you're

02:43:05.402 --> 02:43:08.418
going so you'd have to double back to the
entrance, but it is totally a way to do it.

02:43:08.418 --> 02:43:09.492
LAURA: Look, see?

02:43:09.492 --> 02:43:10.962
SAM: Then we're all going to the same place.

02:43:10.962 --> 02:43:12.076
LAURA: See? Look at this.

02:43:12.076 --> 02:43:16.868
I'm going to stay separate from the group
so I can stealth a little bit better.

02:43:16.868 --> 02:43:18.520
TRAVIS: Twins out in front.

02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:22.582
LAURA: I'm stealthing. Pass Without a Trace on all
of us, then.

02:43:22.582 --> 02:43:26.394
MATT: Stealth checks from all those that are
heading towards the well.

02:43:26.394 --> 02:43:29.571
LAURA: Are we all heading towards the well to jump
down to the Clasp, or is anybody going back

02:43:29.571 --> 02:43:30.921
towards the Keep right now?

02:43:30.921 --> 02:43:33.190
JASON: The well's farther or the Clasp entrance is
farther?

02:43:33.190 --> 02:43:37.198
MATT: The Clasp entrance is closer, the well is
further, so you actually go past it.

02:43:37.198 --> 02:43:41.039
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on. Hang on. We're all
going to the Clasp entrance?

02:43:41.039 --> 02:43:42.492
MATT: That's up to you guys.

02:43:42.492 --> 02:43:45.318
MARISHA: Which is in the same direction as our
keep? Because we have a crippled guy on our

02:43:45.318 --> 02:43:46.767
shoulder.

02:43:46.767 --> 02:43:48.914
TALIESIN: Yeah, we wanted to get the family and
Gilmore back to the keep first.

02:43:48.914 --> 02:43:50.666
LAURA: And the kids. Get them back to the keep.

02:43:50.666 --> 02:43:53.886
SAM: Can't you tree-shoot us, tree-shoot them
there?

02:43:53.886 --> 02:43:59.010
MARISHA: I don't want to use that in case we need
to tree-shoot us to Vasselheim. Or somewhere.

02:43:59.010 --> 02:44:00.329
TALIESIN: Let's hold that off.

02:44:00.329 --> 02:44:04.797
TRAVIS: We're going to the Clasp entrance, right,
to go to the tunnels and all the network of shit

02:44:04.797 --> 02:44:08.284
that we don't understand because they'll be allies
and the people that are going to stealth ahead are

02:44:08.284 --> 02:44:09.554
going to go to the well?

02:44:09.554 --> 02:44:11.663
LAURA: I don't think we should bring three children into
the Clasp.

02:44:11.663 --> 02:44:15.161
TALIESIN: This was my thought, is we take
everybody who's down here, we get them back to the

02:44:15.161 --> 02:44:17.161
castle. In the meantime--

02:44:17.161 --> 02:44:18.462
SAM: Which castle? The keep?

02:44:18.462 --> 02:44:22.034
TALIESIN: Keep. In the meantime, you get the
treasure. Once the treasure is gotten and they're

02:44:22.034 --> 02:44:24.060
back in the keep, we get together and find the
Clasp.

02:44:24.060 --> 02:44:26.312
LAURA: Perfect plan! Let's go.

02:44:26.312 --> 02:44:34.604
MARISHA: I grab Vax's hand and pull him back as
they pace away.

02:44:34.604 --> 02:44:42.576
MATT: Okay. So, as you guys all find your way
outside of the remnants of Gilmore's facility, the

02:44:42.576 --> 02:44:46.456
three children and Salda staying very close. She
keeps the children like right at her sides with her

02:44:46.456 --> 02:44:51.504
arms around them, protectively. Sherri's at her
side as well with her blade out just in case, and

02:44:51.504 --> 02:44:57.080
they're forming this circle around the remnants of
the Tal'Dorei family. As those of you continue to

02:44:57.080 --> 02:45:02.640
push forward, before you disappear, Keyleth grabs
and pulls you.

02:45:02.640 --> 02:45:03.956
LIAM: Splitting off?

02:45:03.956 --> 02:45:04.959
MATT: Yeah.

02:45:04.959 --> 02:45:06.959
LIAM: I have to go.

02:45:06.959 --> 02:45:10.847
MARISHA: What? Don't, wait! Vax, Vax, listen to
me.

02:45:10.847 --> 02:45:13.052
LIAM: I pull away and go.

02:45:13.052 --> 02:45:17.518
MARISHA: No, Vax! God fuckin', you--

02:45:17.518 --> 02:45:26.688
MATT: As Vax quite literally disappears from your
sight after a few steps, vanishing into the shadow

02:45:26.688 --> 02:45:27.719
of the rubble.

02:45:27.719 --> 02:45:33.912
MARISHA: I go through to my earring. Vax, talk her
out of it. This is not the time to be looting for

02:45:33.912 --> 02:45:39.112
treasure. That's only ever brought us grief. Talk
her out of it.

02:45:39.112 --> 02:45:48.727
LAURA: 29, 39 on stealth for me.

02:45:48.727 --> 02:45:50.068
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

02:45:50.068 --> 02:45:51.192
SAM: 28.

02:45:51.192 --> 02:45:52.445
LAURA: Plus ten?

02:45:52.445 --> 02:45:53.898
MARISHA: Who's taking the kids home?

02:45:53.898 --> 02:45:57.149
LAURA: Trinket's going with you guys, by the way.

02:45:57.149 --> 02:45:58.465
LIAM: 42.

02:45:58.465 --> 02:46:02.718
MARISHA: You're coming with us?

02:46:02.718 --> 02:46:05.740
TRAVIS: I'm going, yeah, with the kids.

02:46:05.740 --> 02:46:12.895
MARISHA: With the kids? I'll cast Pass Without a
Trace on us. On team back-to-the-keep.

02:46:12.895 --> 02:46:20.273
MATT: Okay. I'll have you guys roll a stealth
check as well. Okay. And you're heading with them

02:46:20.273 --> 02:46:21.099
to the--

02:46:21.099 --> 02:46:23.514
JASON: So, well. In what direction is the keep,
because--

02:46:23.514 --> 02:46:26.824
MATT: The keep is southward. It's away from the
entrance to the Clasp.

02:46:26.824 --> 02:46:30.429
JASON: Garthok's dilemma is his first priority is
trying to--

02:46:30.429 --> 02:46:32.317
SAM: Garthok's Dilemma is a great book.

02:46:32.317 --> 02:46:33.957
(laughter)

02:46:33.957 --> 02:46:37.214
LAURA: Do what you got to do, Garthok.

02:46:37.214 --> 02:46:39.151
JASON: Garthok's dilemma is his--

02:46:39.151 --> 02:46:40.804
TRAVIS: Don't tell us, just do it!

02:46:40.804 --> 02:46:45.393
JASON: He's got to go towards the Clasp because
he's trying to make sure they're still alive.

02:46:45.393 --> 02:46:49.534
MATT: As you guys divide, Garthok still stands
there for a second looking back and forth,

02:46:49.534 --> 02:46:54.482
conflicted by this. Vex, you pick up on this as
you're walking away.

02:46:54.482 --> 02:46:58.013
LAURA: What're you doing?

02:46:58.013 --> 02:47:06.722
JASON: I have to go, I have to find the Clasp. It's my
number one priority. It's why I sought you guys

02:47:06.722 --> 02:47:08.801
out in the first place.

02:47:08.801 --> 02:47:10.696
MARISHA: We understand. We've got the kids.

02:47:10.696 --> 02:47:14.695
JASON: I'll meet you at the Clasp entrance.

02:47:14.695 --> 02:47:15.846
LAURA: Where do you want us to meet you?

02:47:15.846 --> 02:47:17.684
SAM: Can you tell us where the entrance is? Do we
know where the entrance is?

02:47:17.684 --> 02:47:18.929
LAURA: Which entrance?

02:47:18.929 --> 02:47:25.456
JASON: The entrance that I know exists is in the
same direction as the treasure, so I will travel

02:47:25.456 --> 02:47:29.504
with you until we get to the entrance, which
hopefully is there and not destroyed.

02:47:29.504 --> 02:47:31.757
LAURA: Better fucking stealth like a
motherfucker.

02:47:31.757 --> 02:47:35.807
JASON: Ready. 14.

02:47:35.807 --> 02:47:38.180
MATT: Plus ten. 24 for stealth.

02:47:38.180 --> 02:47:39.299
MARISHA: Are we all rolling stealth?

02:47:39.299 --> 02:47:41.131
MATT: Yeah. Everyone is. Plus ten.

02:47:41.131 --> 02:47:42.254
TRAVIS: 27.

02:47:42.254 --> 02:47:43.380
SAM: Pike!

02:47:43.380 --> 02:47:47.540
ASHLEY: Yup. I rolled a 16.

02:47:47.540 --> 02:47:49.818
LAURA: Yeah, 26 stealth, Pike!

02:47:49.818 --> 02:47:51.900
ASHLEY: That was at disadvantage, too.

02:47:51.900 --> 02:47:53.309
MATT: Nice. Well-played.

02:47:53.309 --> 02:47:54.350
MARISHA: 25.

02:47:54.350 --> 02:47:55.279
TALIESIN: 31.

02:47:55.279 --> 02:48:03.589
MATT: All right. So as you guys split off in the
rain, occasionally you hear the slam of something

02:48:03.589 --> 02:48:08.307
heavy echoing in the distance from the Cloudtop
and a guttural yell of frustration.

02:48:08.307 --> 02:48:11.603
LAURA: I'm keeping my eye out for any kind of
anything in front of us.

02:48:11.603 --> 02:48:20.153
MATT: Right. You're not sure what or why
anything's happening, but twice during your

02:48:20.153 --> 02:48:27.926
journey northward for this, you hear a low growl
or roar and there's a flash of fire from over the

02:48:27.926 --> 02:48:37.923
wall. You don't know what happened. As you guys
push, darting through the alleys, for the team

02:48:37.923 --> 02:48:42.513
that's going for the entrance to the Clasp, you
lead them into--

02:48:42.513 --> 02:48:44.213
JASON: A trap! Booyah!

02:48:44.213 --> 02:48:47.714
(laughter)

02:48:47.714 --> 02:48:49.425
LAURA: You motherfucker!

02:48:49.425 --> 02:48:50.977
MATT: That would've been amazing.

02:48:50.977 --> 02:48:54.985
JASON: I've been waiting to trap you for three
hours!

02:48:54.985 --> 02:49:04.997
MATT: You lead them into a wine cellar that is
locked over with a series of chains. You go

02:49:04.997 --> 02:49:09.977
forward and you know where there are two triggers
for two traps that are part of that entrance. You

02:49:09.977 --> 02:49:17.300
go ahead and deftly disable both traps through
hidden mechanisms. You go ahead and pull on one of

02:49:17.300 --> 02:49:22.466
the chains and it extends magically as you pull on
it, almost infinite, or at least for a period of

02:49:22.466 --> 02:49:27.420
time. You find the right link, you activate it,
keeping this all hidden to yourself, because this

02:49:27.420 --> 02:49:30.749
is what you're trained to do, and the chain
disables itself or breaks into three different

02:49:30.749 --> 02:49:35.431
pieces. You then open up the two parts of this
cellar, lead them down into a regular wine cellar.

02:49:35.431 --> 02:49:38.386
It's very dark. There's almost no light down there
other than what's pouring in through this

02:49:38.386 --> 02:49:42.418
entrance. It looks like most of the wine bottles
here have been taken out. It's empty other than a

02:49:42.418 --> 02:49:52.528
few small bottles that are set up in this vast
criss-cross of wooden racks, and you go ahead and

02:49:52.528 --> 02:49:58.353
walk over to one of the barrels and lift up the
top of a heavy, heavy whiskey barrel. Pulling off

02:49:58.353 --> 02:50:02.663
the top of the barrel, the barrel itself does not
move as he's wrestling with it. As he does, he

02:50:02.663 --> 02:50:07.101
climbs into and stops for a second, looks around,
and shows you guys that this barrel itself is

02:50:07.101 --> 02:50:09.913
actually a chute ladder that leads downward into a
subterranean base.

02:50:09.913 --> 02:50:13.658
LAURA: Got it. Now is all that shit up top
going to be open for us when we come back?

02:50:13.658 --> 02:50:18.371
JASON: I could wait for you here or maybe come
with you and get some of that treasure.

02:50:18.371 --> 02:50:21.454
LAURA: It's going to be a while, you know. We've
got to get the treasure and go back to the Keep

02:50:21.454 --> 02:50:22.480
and come back--

02:50:22.480 --> 02:50:23.879
SAM: You can come with us. You can come with us.

02:50:23.879 --> 02:50:26.663
LAURA: I mean, it's up to you. I know you need to
talk to the Clasp, so if you need to talk to them

02:50:26.663 --> 02:50:28.011
and let them know we're on our way--

02:50:28.011 --> 02:50:29.104
SAM: Enough treasure to go around.

02:50:29.104 --> 02:50:30.707
JASON: I could definitely let them know.

02:50:30.707 --> 02:50:32.429
LAURA: It's up to you.

02:50:32.429 --> 02:50:36.489
JASON: I'm relieved that it's there and not
destroyed, so.

02:50:36.489 --> 02:50:41.026
MATT: Okay. So, you guys, now knowing where the
entrance is, you make your way back out. You close

02:50:41.026 --> 02:50:46.125
the cellar and make your way towards where this
dwarf's general description of the well is. I want

02:50:46.125 --> 02:50:47.643
you to make an investigation check.

02:50:47.643 --> 02:50:48.790
SAM: All of us?

02:50:48.790 --> 02:50:49.896
MATT: All of you.

02:50:49.896 --> 02:50:53.165
SAM: 27.

02:50:53.165 --> 02:50:54.681
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

02:50:54.681 --> 02:50:56.626
LAURA: You're not with us.

02:50:56.626 --> 02:50:57.898
TRAVIS: Oh, I thought he said everybody.

02:50:57.898 --> 02:51:01.195
MATT: Sorry, everybody in that group. But
congratulations!

02:51:01.195 --> 02:51:02.589
MARISHA: Oh no!

02:51:02.589 --> 02:51:09.845
TRAVIS: I escort the kids expertly. I'm a champ at
babysitting.

02:51:09.845 --> 02:51:14.720
MATT: You've had a Percy game today. You've had a
lot of twenties.

02:51:14.720 --> 02:51:16.091
LAURA: 19.

02:51:16.091 --> 02:51:16.987
ASHLEY: 20.

02:51:16.987 --> 02:51:17.829
JASON: 14.

02:51:17.829 --> 02:51:18.767
LIAM: 11.

02:51:18.767 --> 02:51:24.294
MATT: 11. So you guys take about 20 minutes,
wandering the area unable to find really which

02:51:24.294 --> 02:51:28.640
destination this is, partially because a lot of
the sections here are partially destroyed or at

02:51:28.640 --> 02:51:33.778
least are unfamiliar to you. You've not spent a
lot of time in this northern area of Emon.

02:51:33.778 --> 02:51:40.195
Scanlan, you dart off for a second, seeing a
similar crossroads between alleys, and you find a

02:51:40.195 --> 02:51:46.540
well that very much appears to be, and you know
it's yours because there's a number of copper and

02:51:46.540 --> 02:51:49.145
gold coins that are scattered around the base of
the well.

02:51:49.145 --> 02:51:52.145
SAM: This is it. Traps?

02:51:52.145 --> 02:51:55.580
LAURA: I look around. Can I perceive anything or
any people around, anything?

02:51:55.580 --> 02:51:57.358
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:51:57.358 --> 02:52:01.129
LAURA: Natural 20.

02:52:01.129 --> 02:52:11.652
MATT: All right. You-- damn, guys. You glance
about and nobody is here. Other than the sound of

02:52:11.652 --> 02:52:16.150
the rain that is still smashing down from outside,
there doesn't appear to be any individual within

02:52:16.150 --> 02:52:18.212
visual range right now.

02:52:18.212 --> 02:52:21.074
SAM: Vex, can you scan for dragons, please?

02:52:21.074 --> 02:52:24.034
LIAM: I rolled a 22 for traps.

02:52:24.034 --> 02:52:29.783
MATT: Okay. No traps from what you can tell. As
you look over the edge of the well, you can see

02:52:29.783 --> 02:52:37.575
where the dirt has been packed in and given a
false, or a somewhat muddy bottom to the well,

02:52:37.575 --> 02:52:42.569
which once held water. And around the edges you
can see where there are a couple of discarded

02:52:42.569 --> 02:52:47.136
shovels thrown to the side, and chunks of the
earth that have been shoved in there to give it

02:52:47.136 --> 02:52:53.639
some sort of bottom. You also see there's maybe
about 20, 30 or so haphazard coins in the bottom.

02:52:53.639 --> 02:52:55.566
Empty.

02:52:55.566 --> 02:52:57.466
SAM: He got it already.

02:52:57.466 --> 02:52:59.151
LAURA: Dicks! Dicks.

02:52:59.151 --> 02:53:01.833
SAM: Talking about dragons?

02:53:01.833 --> 02:53:05.183
LAURA: No, whoever the fuck came and took all the
fucking gold.

02:53:05.183 --> 02:53:06.717
SAM: The dragons came and got it.

02:53:06.717 --> 02:53:07.954
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I think.

02:53:07.954 --> 02:53:12.190
LAURA: Can I take one of the shovels and move some
of the dirt to see if maybe it's deeper than it looks?

02:53:12.190 --> 02:53:15.709
MATT: Okay. You go ahead and move some of the
dirt, and you find a couple more coins, a total of

02:53:15.709 --> 02:53:19.417
35 gold it would be, really, that you get from
it.

02:53:19.417 --> 02:53:20.567
LAURA: What a waste.

02:53:20.567 --> 02:53:26.360
SAM: Can we see, can I see any signs of dragon
claws or dragon slobber or anything?

02:53:26.360 --> 02:53:31.310
MATT: (laughs) There are none around you, and you
gather from the sheer immensity that is the Cinder

02:53:31.310 --> 02:53:35.318
King that if he were to come down here and
retrieve this gold himself, most of the adjacent

02:53:35.318 --> 02:53:39.818
buildings and the well would be ruined.

02:53:39.818 --> 02:53:44.619
SAM: So people put a bunch of gold there then
someone else came and took it?

02:53:44.619 --> 02:53:47.313
JASON: Well, allegedly a bunch of gold. Maybe
that's all they found.

02:53:47.313 --> 02:53:49.782
SAM: It's your fucking people from the Clasp,
isn't it?

02:53:49.782 --> 02:53:51.590
JASON: No!

02:53:51.590 --> 02:53:53.861
LAURA: Can I use tracking to see if it looks like
anybody's been here?

02:53:53.861 --> 02:53:56.086
MATT: Sure. Make a wisdom survival check.

02:53:56.086 --> 02:54:00.208
LAURA: 19.

02:54:00.208 --> 02:54:04.599
MATT: 19. There are a number of footprints,
actually. Relatively recent, that all--

02:54:04.599 --> 02:54:12.033
LAURA: Is that 17 or 11? That's 11. Okay, yeah.

02:54:12.033 --> 02:54:17.364
MATT: Yeah, okay. So looking about, you see the
tracks pushing northward. There's about four fresh

02:54:17.364 --> 02:54:24.622
sets of prints, fresher than the others you see
around it. The trail of coins that follow that for

02:54:24.622 --> 02:54:31.023
about ten, 15 feet, you can tell that they were
taken in haste. You gather by the way it's set up

02:54:31.023 --> 02:54:33.960
that perhaps somebody else had found this cache
before you did.

02:54:33.960 --> 02:54:39.768
LAURA: I never thought, when we came back up out
of the fucking trap door, were the people still

02:54:39.768 --> 02:54:40.775
unconscious?

02:54:40.775 --> 02:54:42.359
MATT: Yeah, they were still unconscious.

02:54:42.359 --> 02:54:43.569
LAURA: Oh, okay.

02:54:43.569 --> 02:54:45.901
SAM: Let's follow the tracks. They're fresh.

02:54:45.901 --> 02:54:50.054
LIAM: Are we really going to scrabble about in the
mud for coin today?

02:54:50.054 --> 02:54:52.202
SAM: Well, we've come this far.

02:54:52.202 --> 02:54:56.175
LIAM: Scanlan.

02:54:56.175 --> 02:54:59.689
SAM: I'm very easily swayed.

02:54:59.689 --> 02:55:02.052
(laughter)

02:55:02.052 --> 02:55:04.004
JASON: What a great leader.

02:55:04.004 --> 02:55:06.164
LIAM: We should go back to the Keep.

02:55:06.164 --> 02:55:07.311
SAM: You're right, you're right.

02:55:07.311 --> 02:55:08.482
LIAM: This is a waste of our time.

02:55:08.482 --> 02:55:11.018
SAM: But if Vex could somehow convince us--

02:55:11.018 --> 02:55:12.695
(laughter)

02:55:12.695 --> 02:55:14.113
SAM: I'd be open to it.

02:55:14.113 --> 02:55:17.863
LAURA: Look, the reason I wanted to come get all
of this gold is because I thought there could be a

02:55:17.863 --> 02:55:24.007
lot of Gilmore's magical items that were probably
put in here. People don't realize what they have.

02:55:24.007 --> 02:55:29.628
I thought it could help us a lot.

02:55:29.628 --> 02:55:34.996
LIAM: I understand, and it was not a bad idea, but
this place has been cleared out, let's--

02:55:34.996 --> 02:55:39.020
LAURA: But what if it's just one or two people
that came and stole everything and we could

02:55:39.020 --> 02:55:40.092
totally take them.

02:55:40.092 --> 02:55:42.773
SAM: And they're like 100 yards away.

02:55:42.773 --> 02:55:47.186
LAURA: And they're like right up the alley. Like
right there. Can I stealth ahead a little bit and see?

02:55:47.186 --> 02:55:56.271
MATT: Okay. You stealth ahead, and at this point,
you follow the tracks that go to the road, and

02:55:56.271 --> 02:55:58.580
they're following the alleys as well, you can see
from the way they're--

02:55:58.580 --> 02:56:01.896
LIAM: Wait wait wait. I'm sorry, one second. You
know, you're very charming, but you're a fucking

02:56:01.896 --> 02:56:04.790
weirdo. And I climb up after my sister stealthily
and follow.

02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:06.338
MATT: Okay. All right.

02:56:06.338 --> 02:56:09.334
SAM: I just shrug. I think he was talking to you.

02:56:09.334 --> 02:56:17.973
(laughter)

02:56:17.973 --> 02:56:19.502
MATT: Okay, and what do you two do?

02:56:19.502 --> 02:56:21.108
JASON: I'm going back to my trap door.

02:56:21.108 --> 02:56:23.567
MATT: Okay. So Garthok, you step away from the
group and head back to the Clasp.

02:56:23.567 --> 02:56:24.972
JASON: Thank you for--

02:56:24.972 --> 02:56:30.758
SAM: It's been a great day killing with you. I
hope our paths cross again, perhaps in the

02:56:30.758 --> 02:56:31.683
catacombs.

02:56:31.683 --> 02:56:33.717
JASON: I will let the Clasp know that you're
coming.

02:56:33.717 --> 02:56:39.126
SAM: Tell them whenever they see Scanlan Shorthalt
to open the door.

02:56:39.126 --> 02:56:42.532
They stealthed, so I don't know where they went,
do I?

02:56:42.532 --> 02:56:44.170
MATT: Roll a perception check.

02:56:44.170 --> 02:56:47.126
LIAM: I got a natural 20 on my stealth.

02:56:47.126 --> 02:56:49.612
SAM: Got a nine on perception.

02:56:49.612 --> 02:56:51.814
MATT: You have no clue.

02:56:51.814 --> 02:56:56.407
SAM: Can I look at the tracks? I can't read
tracks.

02:56:56.407 --> 02:56:59.837
MATT: Go ahead and make a wisdom survival check,
just for the hell of it.

02:56:59.837 --> 02:57:03.614
SAM: Three.

02:57:03.614 --> 02:57:10.843
MATT: Three? Okay. You begin following a set of
tracks that you think is pretty close to theirs.

02:57:10.843 --> 02:57:16.194
Pike, you're with everyone else bringing the rest
of them back to the keep. You're with the other

02:57:16.194 --> 02:57:17.382
half of the group.

02:57:17.382 --> 02:57:18.404
TRAVIS: You're with me, Pike.

02:57:18.404 --> 02:57:19.575
MARISHA: We're babysitting.

02:57:19.575 --> 02:57:21.838
MATT: You guys are babysitting the family and
Gilmore, getting him back to the keep.

02:57:21.838 --> 02:57:24.708
ASHLEY: Oh. Wait, why did I stealth check?

02:57:24.708 --> 02:57:28.673
MATT: To stealth with them to get out of the city,
and we'll get to you guys in just a minute.

02:57:28.673 --> 02:57:30.720
ASHLEY: Oh, I thought I was going with them.

02:57:30.720 --> 02:57:32.637
SAM: Do I even know how to get home from here?

02:57:32.637 --> 02:57:39.444
MATT: Based on that check? You get really
discombobulated in the center of the rainy midday

02:57:39.444 --> 02:57:40.418
of Emon.

02:57:40.418 --> 02:57:41.950
LAURA: I said I was going to be right back,
Scanlan!

02:57:41.950 --> 02:57:47.287
LIAM: A hand shoots out of the darkness and grabs
Scanlan by the nose and tugs him off.

02:57:47.287 --> 02:57:53.610
MATT: Okay. All right. You guys continue on, and
following the tracks a little bit, they lead

02:57:53.610 --> 02:57:58.133
westward and curve down a few more alleys, heading
towards the north entrance to the Cloudtop.

02:57:58.133 --> 02:58:03.281
LAURA: Ah, shit. Fuck it. They're taking it to the
fucking dragon. Dicks.

02:58:03.281 --> 02:58:04.893
MATT: Do you continue to follow or do you head back?

02:58:04.893 --> 02:58:06.555
LAURA: No, we'll fucking go back.

02:58:06.555 --> 02:58:07.720
MATT: Okay.

02:58:07.720 --> 02:58:09.847
SAM: Will you tell me how to get back?

02:58:09.847 --> 02:58:10.998
LAURA: Hey.

02:58:10.998 --> 02:58:12.895
LIAM: Could you say that again with your nose
pinched?

02:58:12.895 --> 02:58:15.034
SAM: Will you tell me how to get back?

02:58:15.034 --> 02:58:16.293
(laughter)

02:58:16.293 --> 02:58:19.176
LAURA: We'll get back. What happened to-- where's
Gorthok?

02:58:19.176 --> 02:58:20.784
SAM: Garthok.

02:58:20.784 --> 02:58:22.112
LAURA: Garthok. Where is he?

02:58:22.112 --> 02:58:28.103
SAM: Garthok told me he was going back to his
Clasp entrance. Our paths will cross again. He

02:58:28.103 --> 02:58:30.411
also said that you were kind of weird.

02:58:30.411 --> 02:58:34.351
LAURA: Oh, well. I am. I start walking back to the
keep.

02:58:34.351 --> 02:58:42.720
MATT: Okay, you guys make your way back. The rest
of you make your way further south, retracing the

02:58:42.720 --> 02:58:48.410
path you took here since you already know what's
there. You do reach a certain point where as you

02:58:48.410 --> 02:58:53.520
push down one of the alleys, a few individuals
come out, blades at the ready and, "Hey! Drop your

02:58:53.520 --> 02:58:57.378
"stuff. Give us what you've go--" And then, at
which--

02:58:57.378 --> 02:58:58.791
MARISHA: Boof!

02:58:58.791 --> 02:59:05.030
MATT: (laughs) At which point, Keyleth socks one
in the jaw as Sherri pulls out a wand and blasts

02:59:05.030 --> 02:59:08.054
one of the nearby pieces of stone off the wall
with a bolt of lightning.

02:59:08.054 --> 02:59:09.477
MARISHA: Not today.

02:59:09.477 --> 02:59:15.520
MATT: Gilmore, who steps onto his feet and carries
his weight for a second raises his hands up, and

02:59:15.520 --> 02:59:23.746
as he does you can see arcane bolts whipping
around him in this almost molecule-like electron

02:59:23.746 --> 02:59:28.787
pattern as he goes, "Do you gentlemen seriously
wish to start this ruckus?"

02:59:28.787 --> 02:59:30.203
SAM: Yeah!

02:59:30.203 --> 02:59:36.740
MATT: They all go, "No." And they slowly back away
and then dart around the corner as fast as they

02:59:36.740 --> 02:59:39.015
can. You hear their feet spattering against the
mud.

02:59:39.015 --> 02:59:41.145
MARISHA: Keyleth goes, yeah, you better run!

02:59:41.145 --> 02:59:43.019
TRAVIS: Way to tell them, Kiki.

02:59:43.019 --> 02:59:48.362
MATT: As Gilmore lowers his hands, he begins to
fall forward.

02:59:48.362 --> 02:59:49.591
TALIESIN: And we grab him.

02:59:49.591 --> 02:59:57.855
MATT: Grab him, catch him, and he's like,
(breathing hard). "That's, that's the last of me.

02:59:57.855 --> 03:00:00.849
"That's all I've got. Take me home. Please."

03:00:00.849 --> 03:00:02.686
MARISHA: We're almost home. Almost home.

03:00:02.686 --> 03:00:04.240
MATT: Pinches your cheek, Grog.

03:00:04.240 --> 03:00:05.481
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

03:00:05.481 --> 03:00:07.724
(laughter)

03:00:07.724 --> 03:00:17.459
MATT: You guys continue to the path. As you make
your way through the groups of the dead that you

03:00:17.459 --> 03:00:21.369
passed before, a lot of them have since been taken
off the street and you can see now graves are

03:00:21.369 --> 03:00:27.692
being dug right outside of the gate as you find
the south gate. Do you want to walk through the

03:00:27.692 --> 03:00:32.013
fields or do you want to use the same path you
took into the secret path into the Keep?

03:00:32.013 --> 03:00:34.739
TRAVIS: I think the fields would be my vote.

03:00:34.739 --> 03:00:35.828
LAURA: What?

03:00:35.828 --> 03:00:37.356
MATT: You're not there.

03:00:37.356 --> 03:00:41.043
TALIESIN: No one's noticing us at this point.
There's too much going on.

03:00:41.043 --> 03:00:44.069
TRAVIS: Oh. Out of the city is I think the safest
way.

03:00:44.069 --> 03:00:51.339
MARISHA: Why wouldn't we take the secret passage?
It's here, right? No?

03:00:51.339 --> 03:00:56.096
MATT: As soon as you say secret passage, Gren, the
little boy, is like, "Did you say secret passage?"

03:00:56.096 --> 03:00:58.621
MARISHA: I did! I did!

03:00:58.621 --> 03:01:01.530
MATT: Comes up and like, "I've never seen a secret
passage before."

03:01:01.530 --> 03:01:02.980
MARISHA: Do you want to go see it?

03:01:02.980 --> 03:01:05.806
MATT: "Can we see the secret passage?" The kids
seem really excited and you can see Salda, for the

03:01:05.806 --> 03:01:08.057
first time since you've seen her, smiles a little
bit.

03:01:08.057 --> 03:01:10.191
MARISHA: We can't disappoint the children.

03:01:10.191 --> 03:01:15.116
TRAVIS: (sighs) Fine. Secret passage it is.

03:01:15.116 --> 03:01:18.103
LAURA: Trinket's with you guys, don't forget.

03:01:18.103 --> 03:01:22.557
MATT: Trinket's been keeping guard through the mud
behind you.

03:01:22.557 --> 03:01:24.044
TALIESIN: Let the kids ride Trinket.

03:01:24.044 --> 03:01:32.109
MATT: As a relatively stealthy bear would try. As
you make your way through the secret passage,

03:01:32.109 --> 03:01:39.455
successfully finding your way back to Greyskull
Keep, you climb up back into the kitchen and there

03:01:39.455 --> 03:01:47.809
you can see Laina and Erwen who are both sweaty,
their stains are soaking through their outfits.

03:01:47.809 --> 03:01:51.238
They've been working around the clock to make sure
that everyone who's currently held within the keep

03:01:51.238 --> 03:01:55.373
is being cared for and fed, and their faces
immediately light up as you all start pouring out

03:01:55.373 --> 03:02:00.491
of the pantry. "I'm so glad to see all of you. I
wasn't sure if you'd come back."

03:02:00.491 --> 03:02:03.001
SAM: Are we there now?

03:02:03.001 --> 03:02:09.098
MATT: They're getting there first, before the rest
of you. And she runs up and embraces each of you,

03:02:09.098 --> 03:02:13.059
wipes her brow. "I'll have food soon."

03:02:13.059 --> 03:02:14.819
MARISHA: It's okay, it's okay.

03:02:14.819 --> 03:02:18.335
MATT: And she goes over and sees. "And the
children, you got children with you?"

03:02:18.335 --> 03:02:21.856
TALIESIN: We don't know whose they are.

03:02:21.856 --> 03:02:27.769
MATT: The kids get really shy, seem quiet and hide
behind Salda. She goes, "It's all right. We'll

03:02:27.769 --> 03:02:33.060
"take them-- where should we take them? Where
should we go? Lead on, I've never been here before."

03:02:33.060 --> 03:02:34.735
ASHLEY: You can put them in my room.

03:02:34.735 --> 03:02:35.916
TRAVIS: Yeah, or mine.

03:02:35.916 --> 03:02:38.662
TALIESIN: Yeah, we'll put them up. I can sleep in
my workshop.

03:02:38.662 --> 03:02:40.865
MARISHA: I think we've pulled a lot of our beds
down--

03:02:40.865 --> 03:02:43.103
MATT: Yeah, most of the beds, most of your rooms
are--

03:02:43.103 --> 03:02:49.771
MARISHA: We'll find a place for you. Just get
comfortable for right now. It's a little cramped,

03:02:49.771 --> 03:02:52.416
I'm sorry. It's not Castletop.

03:02:52.416 --> 03:02:57.844
MATT: "You saw where we were. We'll take anything
at this point." Gilmore comes in and looks around.

03:02:57.844 --> 03:03:04.033
"You know, I'm not going to lie, I always wanted
to see the place. Perhaps a tour is in order.

03:03:04.033 --> 03:03:11.710
"Tomorrow." He hangs his head. You make your way
into the rest of--

03:03:11.710 --> 03:03:14.440
MARISHA: I find a bed. Where's the nearest bed?

03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:18.045
MATT: The nearest bed would be one of the beds
that you guys moved into Sarenrae's temple.

03:03:18.045 --> 03:03:19.440
MARISHA: Is there someone on it?

03:03:19.440 --> 03:03:23.165
MATT: There's someone sitting on it, but as soon
as you bring someone who looks as wrecked as he is--

03:03:23.165 --> 03:03:24.491
MARISHA: I say, hey, beat it.

03:03:24.491 --> 03:03:26.280
MATT: Yeah. They get up and leave and you lay
Gilmore down.

03:03:26.280 --> 03:03:27.580
LIAM: "But my elbow really hurts!"

03:03:27.580 --> 03:03:29.255
(laughter)

03:03:29.255 --> 03:03:36.607
MATT: After a short time of getting them
established with Greyskull Keep, the rest of Vox

03:03:36.607 --> 03:03:43.764
Machina arrives, the rain now pouring heavily
outside. Looking back, you can see some of the

03:03:43.764 --> 03:03:50.096
smoke has lessened. It's helping put out some of
the fires in the remaining piles of burning wood

03:03:50.096 --> 03:03:52.378
that were once buildings of Emon.

03:03:52.378 --> 03:04:01.095
MARISHA: Keyleth runs up to Vax and gives him a
hug. You're okay, you're okay? You did it? You

03:04:01.095 --> 03:04:02.921
talked her out of it?

03:04:02.921 --> 03:04:08.724
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah, Keyleth. He talked me out of
it. I walk past.

03:04:08.724 --> 03:04:13.005
MARISHA: Thank you. And I walk away.

03:04:13.005 --> 03:04:19.968
MATT: Okay. As you guys get everyone situated in
the Keep, your mind begins to turn to what the

03:04:19.968 --> 03:04:27.228
next step is in preparing for whatever the next
step you want to be. And we'll go ahead and finish

03:04:27.228 --> 03:04:32.839
tonight's game at that point. Pick this up again
next week, so we can go ahead and take a moment

03:04:32.839 --> 03:04:35.977
here to prepare for Critmas. I know some of you
guys have got to run, so if you've got to run, say

03:04:35.977 --> 03:04:37.312
goodbye to the folks--

03:04:37.312 --> 03:04:40.350
LAURA: Oh, you guys are all so wonderful and we
love you.

03:04:40.350 --> 03:04:41.894
TALIESIN: Sorry.

03:04:41.894 --> 03:04:50.011
MATT: We'll stay, we'll open the gifts for them.
And get those to them, so we will be surprised for them.

03:04:50.011 --> 03:04:51.128
LAURA: Yes, please.

03:04:51.128 --> 03:04:55.610
MATT: And also, guys, once again I want to give a
big thank you to Jason Charles Miller.

03:04:55.610 --> 03:04:58.292
(cheering)

03:04:58.292 --> 03:04:59.471
LAURA: Yay, Garthok!

03:04:59.471 --> 03:05:01.508
MARISHA: Yeah, Garthok! Party on, Garthok!

03:05:01.508 --> 03:05:10.284
JASON: So, also, tomorrow night, on this very
channel at 7PM Pacific, 10PM Eastern, I am playing

03:05:10.284 --> 03:05:15.320
an acoustic concert. Right here, same channel,
just one click away.

03:05:15.320 --> 03:05:17.799
TRAVIS: In character or as Jason?

03:05:17.799 --> 03:05:22.572
JASON: As Jason. Maybe I'll try to write a Garthok

cameos in my videos.

03:05:43.203 --> 03:05:47.276
MATT: Yeah, that's true, actually. So, there's
that. And, actually, Mark Holmes, who's the

03:05:47.276 --> 03:05:54.533
dungeon master for the Yogscast RPG show that just
started who are friends of ours, he makes a small

03:05:54.533 --> 03:05:58.907
cameo in one of the videos as well when he was in
America briefly, so it all ties together. Yeah, he

03:05:58.907 --> 03:06:03.144
was there for that shoot. He's in the background
with me in one of the shots. Yeah, just look for

03:06:03.144 --> 03:06:08.228
his nerdy British self. It's great. Love you,
Mark. But yeah, Jason, thank you again for

03:06:08.228 --> 03:06:13.110
