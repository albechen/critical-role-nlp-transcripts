00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:03.861
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.861 --> 00:00:08.443
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons. Glad you could join us for

00:00:08.443 --> 00:00:15.416
what is essentially the final and epilogue episode
of our five-year campaign. We're excited you guys

00:00:15.416 --> 00:00:16.653
could come join us.

00:00:16.653 --> 00:00:17.988
SAM: Not the final episode of the show!

00:00:17.988 --> 00:00:23.595
MATT: We will return. We're looking probably at
the start of the new year with a new campaign, new

00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:24.736
characters.

00:00:24.736 --> 00:00:26.651
LAURA: But we'll have one-shots and stuff in
between.

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:29.933
MATT: Yeah, we'll have fun stuff to break it up
and give us some time to let off some steam in the

00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:35.141
meantime. But before we get into tonight's game,
let's get through some quick announcements. First

00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:38.474
off, we wanted to give a shout out. If you guys
haven't seen it yet, Shadow of War just came out,

00:00:38.474 --> 00:00:42.987
the sequel to Shadow of Mordor. A bunch of us have
worked on it and if you haven't seen, we had the

00:00:42.987 --> 00:00:48.240
opportunity to do a cool thing with WB Games and
the folks at Monolith. We did a Shadow of War

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.776
one-shot that was uploaded as a two-parter.

00:00:50.776 --> 00:00:52.387
LAURA: It was so much fun!

00:00:52.387 --> 00:00:57.335
LIAM: You were so cute, all of you. It was the
cutest orc adventure that ever happened.

00:00:57.335 --> 00:00:59.481
SAM: You watched it?

00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:01.127
LIAM: Both episodes.

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:02.518
LAURA: Thanks bro!

00:01:02.518 --> 00:01:06.868
MATT: It was a lot of fun. We had Sam, Laura,
Travis, and the illustrious Darin De Paul as our

00:01:06.868 --> 00:01:13.897
four orcs and/or olog-hai, charging their way
through Mordor in hopes of victory spoils and all that.

00:01:13.897 --> 00:01:16.789
LAURA: It's &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; fun to be stupid.

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.292
TRAVIS: I don't know what you're talking about.

00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:23.251
MATT: So I recommend checking it out if you
haven't yet. Merch update, Laura?

00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:28.714
LIAM: Wait! Something I can say now. I didn't have
the green light, but I am in that game. I had to

00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:37.736
fib and say that I wasn't in that game, but I'm in
that game! I am back as Gollum! And I run around

00:01:37.736 --> 00:01:44.043
and I do this, and I do this, and I do this, and I
do this. (Gollum voice) Tasty fish!

00:01:44.043 --> 00:01:49.997
MATT: If you guys haven't seen Liam's Gollum in
the games, it's the most ridiculous--

00:01:49.997 --> 00:01:54.824
TRAVIS: Also to point out, you did the full mo-cap
for it. Not just the VO.

00:01:54.824 --> 00:02:00.809
LIAM: Broke my back, scuttled around like I was a
young buck, which I'm not. It was great!

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:06.500
LAURA: I wish I still had the video of you that
you sent me after you first started, yeah. When he

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.692
first started playing Gollum, he sent me this
video of him running around his living room,

00:02:10.692 --> 00:02:15.405
jumping up on his couch, then running over and
jumping up your entertainment system or

00:02:15.405 --> 00:02:16.423
something.

00:02:16.423 --> 00:02:20.376
LIAM: I put my laptop on the coffee table, I hit
click, and I started going--

00:02:20.376 --> 00:02:22.605
LAURA: It was so amazing.

00:02:22.605 --> 00:02:24.752
LIAM: Because I'm a nerd.

00:02:24.752 --> 00:02:29.262
MATT: Awesome. Well, thank you for the follow-up
on that, Liam. Laura?

00:02:29.262 --> 00:02:35.141
LAURA: Oh, well, technically, I have to shove this
one to Liam and Taliesin, as well.

00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:39.999
TALIESIN: I feel like we've been doing the thing
for a while now.

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:45.783
LIAM: Yeah, like when parents have a baby, you
don't see them for a while. They're with that baby

00:02:45.783 --> 00:02:48.181
every hour, every minute.

00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:55.311
(yelling)

00:02:55.311 --> 00:03:01.584
LIAM: Oh my gosh, it's the new art book! Oh my
god, it's gorgeous! I took it out of the Ark of

00:03:01.584 --> 00:03:03.178
the Covenant, and here it is!

00:03:03.178 --> 00:03:08.370
LAURA: Okay, I should qualify this, because it's
not in the store yet, you guys, so don't go to the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.611
store and freak out. It just came into the
office.

00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:16.283
LIAM: Yeah, this is just our viewing copy. There
will be more details--

00:03:16.283 --> 00:03:18.319
SAM: What does it say on the title there?

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.308
LIAM: It says The Chronicles of Exandria: The Tale
of Vox Machina. One.

00:03:23.308 --> 00:03:26.298
SAM: Volume One? Implying that there's going to be
more?

00:03:26.298 --> 00:03:28.535
TALIESIN: Implying that we'd like to.

00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:35.383
LIAM: We'd like there to be. And you guys can tune
in next week to Talks Machina, where we will have

00:03:35.383 --> 00:03:37.776
more info, more details.

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:40.454
LAURA: We'll say when they're going to go in the
store.

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:42.363
MATT: Can you give a teaser flip of any pages?

00:03:42.363 --> 00:03:51.985
LIAM: I have been told that I cannot give a teaser
flip. But wait, guys. There's more! Taliesin, if

00:03:51.985 --> 00:03:53.234
you would?

00:03:53.234 --> 00:04:00.469
TALIESIN: Well, we did two editions because we
wanted to do something a little ridiculous. And so--

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:05.357
SAM: What is this? A special edition?

00:04:05.357 --> 00:04:13.052
TALIESIN: This is a special edition. It's a little
more fancy. It's got the ribbon and leather and

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:20.604
gold foil. It's got an evil tome vibe, and it's
got lots of little wonderful details.

00:04:20.604 --> 00:04:28.392
LIAM: We have held that book and looked through
it. I cried 97 times in one minute. It is so

00:04:28.392 --> 00:04:29.949
beautiful.

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.392
MARISHA: It really looks like crying for 60
seconds.

00:04:32.392 --> 00:04:39.174
LAURA: Tune in to Talks Machina on Tuesday. We'll
give you more details about how you can purchase

00:04:39.174 --> 00:04:44.794
them. And you can always check out
geekandsundry.com/artbook for more updates.

00:04:44.794 --> 00:04:49.408
They're coming soon. They should be in the
warehouse very soon, so that's happy for the

00:04:49.408 --> 00:04:50.724
holidays.

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:53.178
LIAM: Joe Madureira art!

00:04:53.178 --> 00:04:55.671
LAURA: I'm excited!

00:04:55.671 --> 00:04:58.622
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's lots to talk about in
these books. I'm very excited!

00:04:58.622 --> 00:05:05.485
TRAVIS: And to cure any freakout, Ashley is going
to join us. She's finishing up.

00:05:05.485 --> 00:05:09.874
MATT: Finishing up shooting on Blindspot. So
she'll pop in when she can.

00:05:09.874 --> 00:05:11.684
LAURA: This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; her day job!

00:05:11.684 --> 00:05:14.540
TALIESIN: We keep trying to tell her that, don't
we?

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.234
LIAM: Wait. There's one last thing.

00:05:20.234 --> 00:05:21.878
SAM: Two more editions of the art book!

00:05:21.878 --> 00:05:31.269
LIAM: I got one last thing, for funsies. It's a
really late birthday present. It's kind of for

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:40.359
funsies, but Travis, I have something for you that
I've been wanting to give you for a while.

00:05:40.359 --> 00:05:42.182
SAM: Is that an experience?

00:05:42.182 --> 00:05:46.194
TRAVIS: Can I open it?

00:05:46.194 --> 00:05:47.750
LIAM: Yeah, go for it.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.458
TRAVIS: What the fuck is this? (gasps)

00:05:50.458 --> 00:05:53.588
SAM: Is it the Belt of Dwarvenkind?!

00:05:53.588 --> 00:05:57.854
(yelling)

00:05:57.854 --> 00:06:00.304
LAURA: Look at how big the face is!

00:06:00.304 --> 00:06:10.975
TRAVIS: Oh my god! Hug me through my wife! That's
so great! I can't get hit in the dick with this

00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:19.474
on! This is amazing! It really covers the whole
kit and kaboodle!

00:06:19.474 --> 00:06:25.073
LIAM: And your beard will double in length the
moment you put it on. I had to repay you for the

00:06:25.073 --> 00:06:27.492
raven mask you gave me, once upon a time.

00:06:27.492 --> 00:06:34.296
LAURA: Oh yeah, our drunken ren fair purchases. I
was like, "that's a cool mask! Where'd you get it?"

00:06:34.296 --> 00:06:36.764
And you said, "you got that for me."

00:06:36.764 --> 00:06:40.180
LIAM: Your husband just bought this for me!
Thanks, Laura!

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:51.624
MATT: There you go. Also immune to poison. Good
job. Perfect! So other updates. We are officially

00:06:51.624 --> 00:06:56.811
announcing the second edition of Vox Machina:
Origins, the Critical Role comic. It's going to be

00:06:56.811 --> 00:07:06.718
available October 18th, so look for that on all
your great comic book-- Comixology, the Dark Horse

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:18.957
app, and all the other places that I can't think
of right now. But yeah, so super exciting. This

00:07:18.957 --> 00:07:22.009
one starts bringing in some of the other members
of Vox Machina who didn't show up in the first

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:24.428
issue. So take a look at it, hope you guys enjoy.

00:07:24.428 --> 00:07:28.903
Let's see. Other quick announcements. Wednesday
Club, Taliesin, you have coming up?

00:07:28.903 --> 00:07:34.862
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's October, so we're doing
Halloween. We're doing Hellboy, which I don't

00:07:34.862 --> 00:07:40.715
really know much about. I couldn't think of
anybody who knew a lot about Hellboy. Do you know

00:07:40.715 --> 00:07:42.780
a lot about Hellboy?

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.235
LIAM: I know a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; about Hellboy.

00:07:44.235 --> 00:07:46.127
TALIESIN: Do you want to come on Wednesday Club?

00:07:46.127 --> 00:07:52.328
LIAM: Yes, please! Oh! I bought a Hellboy comic
&lt;i&gt;today&lt;/i&gt;! Another black compendium book to go with

00:07:52.328 --> 00:07:55.163
my other big black blades on my shelf.

00:07:55.163 --> 00:07:58.107
MATT: Liam likes things that are big and black.

00:07:58.107 --> 00:08:02.512
LAURA: I'm glad your mind went there, too.

00:08:02.512 --> 00:08:06.385
TALIESIN: It's going to be Wednesday Club on
Hellboy.

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:08.063
MATT: Then you have something on Friday, as well?

00:08:08.063 --> 00:08:12.397
TALIESIN: I do! I've decided it would be really
funny to be here really late three days in a row

00:08:12.397 --> 00:08:19.177
for the rest of my life, and so I'm-- I don't want
to quite say "taking over." Is "taking over" the word?

00:08:19.177 --> 00:08:20.562
MARISHA: That's fair.

00:08:20.562 --> 00:08:25.561
TALIESIN: I'm taking over Gather Your Party on
Friday nights now, and we're giving it a bit of a

00:08:25.561 --> 00:08:29.916
revamp. It's going to be a bit of a different
vibe. It's going to be a little shorter. It's

00:08:29.916 --> 00:08:33.190
going to be fun. Our very first episode is going
to be called Gather Your Goth, and we're going to

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.493
be giving some of our friends goth makeovers and
having a goth dance contest.

00:08:36.493 --> 00:08:39.225
LAURA: Can I get made over? When are you doing
it?

00:08:39.225 --> 00:08:41.263
TALIESIN: Tomorrow night.

00:08:41.263 --> 00:08:45.245
LAURA: Shit, I'm not going to be here! Fuck, I
really want to be made over!

00:08:45.245 --> 00:08:47.736
TALIESIN: Well I'll tell you what. You let me
know, and you can come over and have a goth

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:49.187
makeover.

00:08:49.187 --> 00:08:52.913
MATT: Next time you do it, you do whatever it's
called, and then in parentheses Laura Your Goth,

00:08:52.913 --> 00:08:54.189
or Goth Your Laura.

00:08:54.189 --> 00:09:06.267
TALIESIN: Gather Your Laura. You would goth out
very well. I think I would be excited by that.

00:09:06.267 --> 00:09:11.611
MATT: All right. To finish this up, let's see. I
forgot to mention it last week, but those of you

00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:17.887
guys who have been playing the Telltale Batman
game, the new Pact episode came out recently with

00:09:17.887 --> 00:09:26.327
Harley Quinn and Bane, and I play Mr. Freeze! It's
been a lot of fun, and I've been continuously

00:09:26.327 --> 00:09:29.747
recording on it. Hope you guys enjoy more fun to
come with that delightful character.

00:09:29.747 --> 00:09:32.004
LIAM: You do have a cold heart.

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:36.139
MATT: It's true. Then you guys had a Sagas of
Sundry announcement?

00:09:36.139 --> 00:09:43.150
MARISHA: Oh yeah! Sagas of Sundry announcement!
Cast list went out! Who's in it? We are!

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.057
LIAM: I didn't see you there at all!

00:09:46.057 --> 00:09:49.539
MARISHA: Look again! Abigail Persimmon.

00:09:49.539 --> 00:09:53.752
TALIESIN: The magic of the goth makeover strikes
again! (cackles)

00:09:53.752 --> 00:09:56.512
MARISHA: I'm not coming tomorrow because I've
already had mine.

00:09:56.512 --> 00:09:58.519
TALIESIN: No, I bought this shirt when we went
shopping.

00:09:58.519 --> 00:10:05.548
MARISHA: That's right! You did! We went on a
shopping trip, and we had so much fun.

00:10:05.548 --> 00:10:08.209
LIAM: It was fucking wild.

00:10:08.209 --> 00:10:12.229
MARISHA: Anyone who hasn't seen any of the first
season--

00:10:12.229 --> 00:10:14.045
MATT: Thanks for keeping tally.

00:10:14.045 --> 00:10:22.572
TRAVIS: He picked his cup up without drinking it
again! Picks it up. (thunk)

00:10:22.572 --> 00:10:24.682
LIAM: Like an animatronic sailor!

00:10:24.682 --> 00:10:31.522
MATT: Like a raccoon that can't find a river, I go
through the motions of washing my food. All right.

00:10:31.522 --> 00:10:39.036
Couple of other things. It is still Sub-tober,
because why not? That means if you haven't had the

00:10:39.036 --> 00:10:43.643
opportunity to subscribe to any of the Twitch
streams that you're a fan of, you can do so half

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:49.808
off until the 18th. So you can do that up until
the 18th and then get the comic the same day, I guess.

00:10:49.808 --> 00:10:54.545
And since this is the final episode of the
campaign, I wanted to give a shout out to all our

00:10:54.545 --> 00:11:01.255
fantastic crew. Wonderful people who have worked
their ass off to stay here late every Thursday. We

00:11:01.255 --> 00:11:07.365
have Maxwell James, Dani Carr, Jason Corey, Ryan
Green, Selina Ruth, Chris Wilmont, Zach Wilson,

00:11:07.365 --> 00:11:15.813
Sax Carr, Mark Donica, Anthony Videsco, Courtney
Kraft, Ian Kagihara, Chris Lockey, Holly Pearson,

00:11:15.813 --> 00:11:24.392
Ryan Porter, Denise, J. Andrew Bernard, Ed Lopez,
Rachel Romero, all of our fantastic mods who have

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:29.726
done an incredible job maintaining the chaos that
is Twitch, you guys are fantastic. We really

00:11:29.726 --> 00:11:32.663
appreciate all the hard work you guys put into it,
and many, many more. The entire community, we

00:11:32.663 --> 00:11:34.066
can't even begin to express--

00:11:34.066 --> 00:11:35.395
LAURA: Did you say Fernando?

00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:39.536
MATT: Yes, I did. Wait, Fernando. Someone didn't
put Fernando on the list!

00:11:39.536 --> 00:11:43.033
SAM: And many more whose names were omitted.

00:11:43.033 --> 00:11:48.025
MATT: Correct, thank you guys so much for all your
hard work!

00:11:48.025 --> 00:11:52.189
LIAM: Wait, let's come up with some more
announcements so we never have to start.

00:11:52.189 --> 00:11:59.110
MATT: Nope, I think we've stretched the audience's
patience enough. Let's go ahead and dive in to

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:04.089
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:12:04.089 --> 00:13:35.087
[dramatic music]

00:13:35.087 --> 00:13:37.200
LIAM: Autoerotic a-pixie-ation.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.164
MATT: You were real late on the draw, but this is
the night to do it. I guess.

00:13:42.164 --> 00:13:43.406
LIAM: Right on time.

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:51.830
MATT: It was perfect. Precisely when you mean to.
All right. Last we left off, Vox Machina, through

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:58.075
their trials and tribulations, had eventually come
to realize the machinations of Vecna, who ascended

00:13:58.075 --> 00:14:04.205
into godhood, transported his city from the
Shadowfell of Thar Amphala to the top, right above

00:14:04.205 --> 00:14:11.796
a long-dead earth primordial titan, rising it and
making its way toward Vasselheim, the Dawn City,

00:14:11.796 --> 00:14:13.718
the beginning of creation.

00:14:13.718 --> 00:14:18.745
You battled your way through its innards, up
within the arcane dome that protected it, managed

00:14:18.745 --> 00:14:25.926
to defeat one half of the long-frustrating
Briarwood coupling, fought your way to the top of

00:14:25.926 --> 00:14:34.387
the tower Entropis, did battle with Vecna, the
Ascended. Through careful planning and sacrifices,

00:14:34.387 --> 00:14:44.219
you managed to apply the trammels, complete the
sealing ritual, and send Vecna screaming across

00:14:44.219 --> 00:14:51.763
the Divine Gate, to be sealed to wherever his
divine demi-plane resides on the other side.

00:14:51.763 --> 00:14:58.065
As you all fell down upon the ruined, floating
platforms of the tower Entropis, you glanced over

00:14:58.065 --> 00:15:04.498
as your recent ally, Arkhan the Cruel, proceeded
to sever his own hand, attach the Hand of Vecna,

00:15:04.498 --> 00:15:15.944
and catching you off guard, transport himself
beyond your current reach. This beat of intensity

00:15:15.944 --> 00:15:22.682
releasing slowly, the adrenaline still wearing its
way through your veins, you sit in silence,

00:15:22.682 --> 00:15:28.079
looking about, amazed that you all still stand
after such a confrontation.

00:15:28.079 --> 00:15:35.401
It's at that moment you hear this distant
explosion. Glancing off the side of the platform

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:42.718
you're on, you can still see, while the large
titan, one of four arms raised, attempting to come

00:15:42.718 --> 00:15:49.455
and destroy all of you with one large blow, frozen
in place, there still remains the dregs of Vecna's

00:15:49.455 --> 00:15:54.624
army down below throughout the city of Vasselheim,
where battles are still raging in the streets. You

00:15:54.624 --> 00:15:59.491
can still see wyvern-riders and eagle-riders in
the sky, though it appears that the gloomstalkers

00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:05.358
that once paraded across the skies over the city
have been destroyed or scattered at the loss of

00:16:05.358 --> 00:16:14.274
the ascended god that summoned them. You also
still are aware of the body of your sister,

00:16:14.274 --> 00:16:23.847
residing on the platforms below. It's at this
point that you notice that the green tendrils of

00:16:23.847 --> 00:16:32.196
energy that hold the Tower of Entropis together
begin to flicker and subside. The platforms that

00:16:32.196 --> 00:16:36.688
were slowly drifting, listing, suddenly begin to
shift.

00:16:36.688 --> 00:16:40.836
LAURA: No! I take off on my broom, and I go down
to try to get her.

00:16:40.836 --> 00:16:44.992
MATT: Okay. You guys dart over the side. What are
the rest of you guys doing?

00:16:44.992 --> 00:16:48.948
TRAVIS: I had the immovable rod pulled out, and I
click it where I am.

00:16:48.948 --> 00:16:53.796
MATT: All right. You hold in place. You feel the
platform give beneath you. Your toes are now

00:16:53.796 --> 00:16:59.076
dangling in the middle of the air as you watch the
cracked-open right side of Entropis' peak begin to

00:16:59.076 --> 00:17:02.443
topple and fall beneath you. What are you guys
doing?

00:17:02.443 --> 00:17:05.698
MARISHA: I'm still a planetar. Do you still have
Bigby's Hand up?

00:17:05.698 --> 00:17:08.433
SAM: For maybe 30 seconds more.

00:17:08.433 --> 00:17:10.487
TALIESIN: Where's the carpet?

00:17:10.487 --> 00:17:11.627
TRAVIS: It's in my bag.

00:17:11.627 --> 00:17:17.396
MARISHA: I do a potato sack hold on Scanlan. Make
sure he's all right.

00:17:17.396 --> 00:17:20.254
MATT: You grab him. Pike still has some time. She
still has her wings.

00:17:20.254 --> 00:17:22.718
TRAVIS: I can throw it to you.

00:17:22.718 --> 00:17:24.404
TALIESIN: That would be nice. Yes, please.

00:17:24.404 --> 00:17:32.118
TRAVIS: Can I pull the carpet out of the bag of
holding? Do you want to free fall and go after it?

00:17:32.118 --> 00:17:36.449
MATT: By the way, the platform is now giving
underneath you.

00:17:36.449 --> 00:17:38.463
SAM: Why don't you fly it over?

00:17:38.463 --> 00:17:43.123
TRAVIS: I don't think I can be on it with him.
Right? I'm still enlarged.

00:17:43.123 --> 00:17:45.985
MARISHA: Here, can one of us fly over and get it?

00:17:45.985 --> 00:17:56.114
LAURA: Technically, he was on the broom with me,
so I could've dropped him off with one of you

00:17:56.114 --> 00:17:57.726
before I flew down to Velora.

00:17:57.726 --> 00:18:03.711
MATT: As you're having this conversation about the
carpet, you're dragged down over the side as the

00:18:03.711 --> 00:18:08.749
broom rockets off, Vex's mind currently focused
more on other things. So the last thing you hear

00:18:08.749 --> 00:18:13.086
from Percival is, "Could you throw--" as he darts
off to the side. The platform is beginning to give

00:18:13.241 --> 00:18:18.654
as the flickering green energy begins to fade. You
guys both dart beneath where you can see upon the

00:18:18.654 --> 00:18:24.959
rubble, where the top staircase had broken apart
from the original sundering of the top of the

00:18:24.959 --> 00:18:30.632
tower. There you see, still lying there, lifeless,
the body of Velora. You rush in there just as the

00:18:30.632 --> 00:18:36.140
platform's collapsing. I need you both to make
acrobatics checks on this to see how quickly you

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.780
can maneuver in and out.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.484
LAURA: Okay, it's 30.

00:18:41.484 --> 00:18:42.831
LIAM: 31.

00:18:42.831 --> 00:18:48.483
MATT: Both of you guys rush inward. As some of the
various chunks are beginning to fall and separate

00:18:48.483 --> 00:18:53.867
from underneath the platforms, you begin to dart
through, dodge, and you grab and lift her body.

00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:58.629
Both of you cradling her, and at a moment's notice,
deciding which one of you's going to take her.

00:18:58.629 --> 00:18:59.912
LIAM: I've got her.

00:18:59.912 --> 00:19:03.099
MATT: All right. Vax, you go ahead and dart off.
You careen back out of the way as the central,

00:19:03.099 --> 00:19:08.538
large platform crashes down with a heavy impact.
You can see it crumble, then break, and three

00:19:08.538 --> 00:19:12.079
separate pieces beginning to tumble. The tower
then gives in from underneath and begins to

00:19:12.079 --> 00:19:17.747
collapse downward, almost like a controlled
demolition. As it begins to fall and topple down

00:19:17.747 --> 00:19:22.956
below, you all gather your thoughts and consider
other allies that were recently--

00:19:22.956 --> 00:19:24.366
TRAVIS: Falling?

00:19:24.366 --> 00:19:27.144
MATT: A short time ago, yes.

00:19:27.144 --> 00:19:29.741
LAURA: Zahra and Kash?

00:19:29.741 --> 00:19:36.376
MARISHA: With Scanlan in hand, start diving down
to go see if I can find them or have any sight of

00:19:36.376 --> 00:19:37.624
them at all.

00:19:37.624 --> 00:19:39.152
MATT: What's the flying speed of your planetar?

00:19:39.152 --> 00:19:40.476
MARISHA: 150 feet.

00:19:40.476 --> 00:19:45.871
MATT: Okay. As you, holding Scanlan under your arm,
coast down at a speed to the point where now

00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:50.857
you're actually racing the crumbling of the tower.
You're watching the actual cracks as they emerge,

00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:55.168
as the energy's dissipating, beginning to subside,
as your speed overtakes the rate in which it's

00:19:55.168 --> 00:19:56.205
collapsing.

00:19:56.205 --> 00:19:57.738
MARISHA: Like Superman and Lois Lane.

00:19:57.738 --> 00:20:04.669
MATT: (laughter). The G's are intense, Scanlan.
Your eyes are watering, blown back on your face.

00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:11.477
The Ioun symbol on your forehead is flaring like a
spotlight ahead of you. As you rocket down, you

00:20:11.477 --> 00:20:16.764
glance, you can see there across the rocks at the
bottom, two wyverns that are scattered across the

00:20:16.764 --> 00:20:22.668
rubble, and you see, lying there, the bodies of
Kashaw and Zahra.

00:20:22.668 --> 00:20:26.111
SAM: They're dead. Turn around. Let's go back.
They're dead.

00:20:26.111 --> 00:20:28.560
MARISHA: Shut up, Scanlan! Are they dead?

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.110
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:34.708
TRAVIS: How high am I hanging off of this thing?

00:20:34.708 --> 00:20:36.760
MATT: Make--

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:41.321
TRAVIS: A perception check? I am a million--
eight.

00:20:41.321 --> 00:20:44.885
MATT: You're high up there. That's a long way up.

00:20:44.885 --> 00:20:46.479
MARISHA: 18.

00:20:46.479 --> 00:20:51.378
LAURA: You can use the carpet because Percy's on
the broom with me.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:55.554
MATT: Their bodies are brutalized from the impact.
They hit.

00:20:55.554 --> 00:20:57.187
MARISHA: They're splatted.

00:20:57.187 --> 00:20:58.987
MATT: Well, they're not splatted.

00:20:58.987 --> 00:21:01.360
LAURA: They're not you on the cliff.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.667
MARISHA: Sure. They didn't goldfish it.

00:21:03.667 --> 00:21:06.529
TRAVIS: But a good Revivify might help.

00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:09.728
SAM: They're unconscious?

00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:13.901
MATT: You're just now approaching. As you get
there, you can hear the rumbling of the tower

00:21:13.901 --> 00:21:16.267
getting louder. You've barely beaten it. What are
you doing?

00:21:16.267 --> 00:21:28.117
MARISHA: I've got to move them, right? Is that
what you're saying? Scanlan? You're fine, right?

00:21:28.117 --> 00:21:29.635
Handle yourself?

00:21:29.635 --> 00:21:34.247
MATT: Scanlan, she sets you on the ground as you
look over and see the tower (crashing).

00:21:34.247 --> 00:21:37.928
MARISHA: Do you want to hold onto my back?

00:21:37.928 --> 00:21:40.702
SAM: I have no spells left, so yes.

00:21:40.702 --> 00:21:43.444
(laughter)

00:21:43.444 --> 00:21:45.670
SAM: I will climb on.

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:49.740
TALIESIN: I imagine Scanlan dropping that last
potion as it's coming down.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:58.723
MATT: Okay. As you dive on, you grab both of their
limp bodies and pull them under your arms and dart.

00:21:58.723 --> 00:22:00.862
I need you to make a dexterity saving throw,
please.

00:22:00.862 --> 00:22:04.111
LAURA: Oh my god, if we thought we made it out of
this--

00:22:04.111 --> 00:22:09.423
MARISHA: Okay, 18. No, wait! Yeah, 18.

00:22:09.423 --> 00:22:19.471
MATT: 18. You manage to scoot by as one of the
large chunks of the base falls over to one side,

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:23.812
and as you dart out, wings before you, Scanlan
clutched on your back, both their bodies beneath,

00:22:23.812 --> 00:22:29.290
you can feel the gust of wind from behind as the
collapsing wall is pushing all the air in your

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:36.103
direction. As you focus down, your wings out, you
manage to careen underneath as the shadow that was

00:22:36.103 --> 00:22:41.109
beginning to fall over you pulls behind, and
behind you hear the (boom), the dust pick up, and

00:22:41.109 --> 00:22:45.167
you guys all look down and watch as the tower
finally falls to its final piece of rubble there

00:22:45.167 --> 00:22:50.881
on the ground. At which point you glance down, and
you can see both of them, their eyes roll open,

00:22:50.881 --> 00:22:57.446
lolling in their face, both Zahra and Kashaw,
seemingly conscious. If you guys want to step in?

00:22:57.446 --> 00:23:04.553
(cheering)

00:23:04.553 --> 00:23:09.310
MARISHA: I'm going to immediately burn two of my
healing touches, and you get 6d8 plus three hit

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.895
points back.

00:23:10.895 --> 00:23:27.206
MATT: Kashaw and Zahra, you've been lying there on
the ground for a moment going, "Ow," and as your

00:23:27.206 --> 00:23:33.814
vision focuses, you watch as the tower begins to
collapse downward in your direction. The shadow

00:23:33.814 --> 00:23:35.700
seems to close over you.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.629
WILL: Well, that's not good.

00:23:37.629 --> 00:23:39.768
MARISHA: 29 hit points to both of you
immediately.

00:23:39.768 --> 00:23:46.821
MATT: And with a flash, something white-feathered
and blue shoots past you, grabs you, and you are

00:23:46.821 --> 00:23:52.250
thrust into the air, carried by the angelic form
of Keyleth.

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:57.696
MARY: Kiki? How are you, darling?

00:23:57.696 --> 00:24:04.385
MARISHA: Did you recognize me because of the
antlers? That's why I keep them. They're very

00:24:04.385 --> 00:24:05.621
identifying.

00:24:05.621 --> 00:24:07.057
MARY: I think I dreamed of you.

00:24:07.057 --> 00:24:16.380
MARISHA: No, that was real and incredible, and you
all showed up.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.346
SAM: Why did you come?

00:24:18.346 --> 00:24:20.593
WILL: We had to come. She made us.

00:24:20.593 --> 00:24:23.812
(laughter)

00:24:23.812 --> 00:24:25.366
MARY: I had a vision.

00:24:25.366 --> 00:24:27.129
WILL: It's good to see you. Thank you for that.

00:24:27.129 --> 00:24:28.500
SAM: You had a vision?

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.406
MARY: I did. I had a vision of white wings, and
blue--

00:24:30.406 --> 00:24:32.786
WILL: Are you okay?

00:24:32.786 --> 00:24:37.307
MARY: I think we're all right.

00:24:37.307 --> 00:24:39.139
WILL: Both of you?

00:24:39.139 --> 00:24:40.547
MARY: Yeah.

00:24:40.547 --> 00:24:42.893
WILL: Don't piss off a pregnant tiefling.

00:24:42.893 --> 00:24:46.871
MARISHA: Yeah-- wait, what?

00:24:46.871 --> 00:24:52.559
WILL: Thank gods for that.

00:24:52.559 --> 00:24:55.358
SAM: Haven't you heard of pulling out?

00:24:55.358 --> 00:24:59.520
(laughter)

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.191
SAM: I do it all the time!

00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:04.618
WILL: I tried. Didn't work.

00:25:04.618 --> 00:25:07.232
MARY: I wouldn't let him.

00:25:07.232 --> 00:25:11.292
WILL: The tail held me in place.

00:25:11.292 --> 00:25:15.413
MARY: You always said you liked that.

00:25:15.413 --> 00:25:22.064
WILL: Can you put us down somewhere, maybe?

00:25:22.064 --> 00:25:24.698
MARY: That would be lovely, thank you.

00:25:24.698 --> 00:25:28.581
MARISHA: I drop Kash, but very lightly set down
Zahra.

00:25:28.581 --> 00:25:30.283
MATT: You tumble.

00:25:30.283 --> 00:25:31.942
MARISHA: Congratulations!

00:25:31.942 --> 00:25:33.407
MARY: Did we win?

00:25:33.407 --> 00:25:37.100
MATT: No, you're healed up; you're fine. The Death
Ward brought you guys to one hit point, and then

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.158
she healed you before she dropped you, so you're
fine.

00:25:39.158 --> 00:25:45.237
WILL: No, I deserved that. Thank you. So did we
win? What happened?

00:25:45.237 --> 00:25:47.462
SAM: We're sitting on the titan now?

00:25:47.462 --> 00:25:50.281
MATT: You're down in the street level of Thar
Amphala.

00:25:50.281 --> 00:25:52.055
SAM: But still on the Titan?

00:25:52.055 --> 00:25:53.369
MATT: Still on the top of the Titan.

00:25:53.369 --> 00:25:54.808
SAM: Is he falling?

00:25:54.808 --> 00:25:56.598
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:25:56.598 --> 00:25:59.242
SAM: Two.

00:25:59.242 --> 00:26:01.449
MATT: You have no idea.

00:26:01.449 --> 00:26:06.540
SAM: Pregnant?! What? I thought you were gay!

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:11.313
WILL: We've talked about this. It's all right.

00:26:11.313 --> 00:26:16.455
TRAVIS: Can I take out the carpet and start making
my enlarged form way down to them? By myself?

00:26:16.455 --> 00:26:18.446
LAURA: Well, Pike's with you.

00:26:18.446 --> 00:26:19.857
TRAVIS: Oh. Is she?

00:26:19.857 --> 00:26:21.371
LAURA: Yeah, Pike's still with you up there.

00:26:21.371 --> 00:26:22.735
TRAVIS: She's got wings.

00:26:22.735 --> 00:26:27.728
MATT: With a strength of 19, and your enlarged
size--

00:26:27.728 --> 00:26:29.843
TRAVIS: Can I dispel the enlarged?

00:26:29.843 --> 00:26:31.480
MATT: No.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.698
TRAVIS: Oh, it's in for ten minutes. I'm just me.

00:26:33.698 --> 00:26:37.092
(laughter)

00:26:37.092 --> 00:26:42.804
MATT: You get the sense, at this size, that carpet
cannot carry you.

00:26:42.804 --> 00:26:50.947
TRAVIS: I'm just hanging out. I grab the earring
and I say: Will someone please do me a favor? Will

00:26:50.947 --> 00:26:55.494
you look for Arkhan's hand? Find me that hand.

00:26:55.494 --> 00:26:58.960
SAM: Is it falling?

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.000
MATT: It was on one of the platforms.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.438
MARISHA: Wait, you want to find his hand on the
giant tower full of rubble?

00:27:05.438 --> 00:27:06.955
WILL: Whose hand?

00:27:06.955 --> 00:27:10.117
TRAVIS: Arkhan's.

00:27:10.117 --> 00:27:11.848
LIAM: Vex or I can find it.

00:27:11.848 --> 00:27:14.128
LAURA: In a moment.

00:27:14.128 --> 00:27:19.352
MATT: At this point, you have both come down now
to the base of the tower. At that speed, it took

00:27:19.352 --> 00:27:21.605
you a while to catch up to the rest of everybody
else.

00:27:21.605 --> 00:27:29.699
MARISHA: I look up and say: Grog, do you need a
hand? Are you all right? Damn it, the pun wasn't

00:27:29.699 --> 00:27:31.062
intended, Scanlan!

00:27:31.062 --> 00:27:33.345
(laughter)

00:27:33.345 --> 00:27:38.142
TRAVIS: I literally just said that.

00:27:38.142 --> 00:27:44.425
MARISHA: Do you need assistance getting down from
hanging from a bar? In the middle of the air, to

00:27:44.425 --> 00:27:46.009
be very literal.

00:27:46.009 --> 00:27:48.198
TRAVIS: Yeah, it would be nice.

00:27:48.198 --> 00:27:50.869
MARISHA: I fly up.

00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:53.017
MATT: So your angelic wing maneuver.

00:27:53.017 --> 00:27:54.806
MARY: I can cast Fly on him.

00:27:54.806 --> 00:27:57.459
SAM: Yeah, do that! Zahra has Fly, she can cast
Fly on him!

00:27:57.459 --> 00:27:59.317
MARY: I cast Fly on Grog.

00:27:59.317 --> 00:28:01.626
MATT: Okay. You'll have to get up a little closer
to do it, because you're out of range.

00:28:01.626 --> 00:28:06.917
MARY: Can I use my Cloak of the Bat to fly up and
then cast?

00:28:06.917 --> 00:28:08.345
MATT: Yeah.

00:28:08.345 --> 00:28:10.544
MARY: I fly up and I cast. Hello, darling!

00:28:10.544 --> 00:28:15.948
MATT: You watch as Zahra, suddenly her cloak
extends into two large, leathery bat wings and she

00:28:15.948 --> 00:28:21.473
flies her way up pretty close to where you are.
For a second there, you glance down. Roll a

00:28:21.473 --> 00:28:23.817
perception check.

00:28:23.817 --> 00:28:25.270
TRAVIS: Ten.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:27.356
MATT: You see a gloomstalker coming right at you.

00:28:27.356 --> 00:28:29.021
TRAVIS: (screams)

00:28:29.021 --> 00:28:32.867
MATT: As you hold the sword out in front, you
notice in a second, it's Zahra.

00:28:32.867 --> 00:28:35.121
TRAVIS: Oh. Not a gloomstalker.

00:28:35.121 --> 00:28:40.493
MATT: But the sword, at this point, as you hold it
out in front of you and push back, it goes, "One

00:28:40.493 --> 00:28:50.198
"part is done. Well played. But he still survives.
We'll take him. And we'll take that dragon. The

00:28:50.198 --> 00:28:54.957
"hand must be destroyed. It's still out there.
Together--"

00:28:54.957 --> 00:28:57.330
TRAVIS: Okay, yeah, I sheathe him.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:01.575
(laughter)

00:29:01.575 --> 00:29:04.049
TRAVIS: I need some Visine bad.

00:29:04.049 --> 00:29:06.780
MARY: Grog! Hello, darling.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.179
TRAVIS: Hey, Zahra.

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:10.059
MARY: Did you ever use that moonhammer I gave
you?

00:29:10.059 --> 00:29:13.004
TRAVIS: All the time. Covered in blood.

00:29:13.004 --> 00:29:14.942
MARY: Right. In the moonlight, right?

00:29:14.942 --> 00:29:16.519
TRAVIS: Yep. Need to get it cleaned.

00:29:16.519 --> 00:29:20.895
MARY: Good. Well, I look forward to hearing your
tales. Do you need some help, my darling?

00:29:20.895 --> 00:29:24.919
TRAVIS: I do, unless you just want to hang out
with me up here for a bit.

00:29:24.919 --> 00:29:31.286
MARY: Well, I could. How is your arm? You know
what, no, let's just do it. I cast Fly. Let go.

00:29:31.286 --> 00:29:34.600
MATT: And you can fly. You're gliding in the air.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.206
(laughter)

00:29:37.206 --> 00:29:39.501
MATT: He starts slowly--

00:29:39.501 --> 00:29:42.514
TALIESIN, LAURA, and MARISHA: Don't leave the
rod!

00:29:42.514 --> 00:29:44.497
TRAVIS: How do I do this?

00:29:44.497 --> 00:29:55.627
MARY: It's all right. Just focus. Focus. You'll be
fine, Grog. Just focus. Yes, think of yourself as

00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:58.142
a cow. As a flying cow. You remember?

00:29:58.142 --> 00:30:02.799
TRAVIS: Moo.

00:30:02.799 --> 00:30:04.138
LAURA: Grab the rod.

00:30:04.138 --> 00:30:09.447
TRAVIS: Oh, right. (click) Put it back in the bag
of holding. This is great! Oh my god, I would do

00:30:09.447 --> 00:30:10.790
this every day.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:13.845
MARY: Well, you could do it for at least an hour,
so that's good.

00:30:13.845 --> 00:30:17.158
TRAVIS: Can I drunkenly fly down to everybody
else?

00:30:17.158 --> 00:30:23.477
MATT: And you do, it's a slow spiral, and you
begin to gimbal backward, and she has to right you

00:30:23.477 --> 00:30:24.607
a couple times.

00:30:24.607 --> 00:30:27.027
TRAVIS: Can I fly right as I get closer, just for
dramatic effect?

00:30:27.027 --> 00:30:33.337
MARY: Focus on me. No squirrel. There's no
squirrels. Focus your mind. No. It's all right,

00:30:33.337 --> 00:30:36.809
just come down. (singing)

00:30:36.809 --> 00:30:39.639
TRAVIS: I come down!

00:30:39.639 --> 00:30:41.767
MARY: All right, you could do that, too. Look out
below!

00:30:41.767 --> 00:30:44.356
TRAVIS: Three-point landing. Super hard.

00:30:44.356 --> 00:30:46.636
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

00:30:46.636 --> 00:30:47.719
TRAVIS: Super hard.

00:30:47.719 --> 00:30:48.954
WILL: Superhero landing.

00:30:48.954 --> 00:30:50.723
TRAVIS: (high voice) Not great.

00:30:50.723 --> 00:30:51.667
TALIESIN: Yay!

00:30:51.667 --> 00:30:52.494
LAURA: Not bad.

00:30:52.494 --> 00:30:54.062
TRAVIS: Oh, not bad, yeah. Yeah. 14.

00:30:54.062 --> 00:31:09.247
MATT: 14. Okay. You were rage-hanging? You take 24
points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to 12.

00:31:09.247 --> 00:31:10.919
LAURA: And Grog is dead.

00:31:10.919 --> 00:31:17.890
MATT: And three-point landing. You watch as a
crater is left beneath where his impact is. The

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:22.512
smoke slowly subsides, and Grog's there, fist in
the ground, Thor: Ragnarok style.

00:31:22.512 --> 00:31:24.297
LAURA: And we're all on the ground now?

00:31:24.297 --> 00:31:27.547
MATT: You are all now on the ground floor of Thar
Amphala. As you glance around--

00:31:27.547 --> 00:31:31.830
LIAM: I'm flexing the wings out and around, and
I'm making a feather bed with the ends of the

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:34.181
wings on the ground and laying Velora down on it.

00:31:34.181 --> 00:31:37.042
LAURA: Kash, tell me you have Revivify. Tell me
you can bring her back.

00:31:37.042 --> 00:31:38.748
WILL: I believe I do.

00:31:38.748 --> 00:31:43.134
LIAM: I start combing her hair with my fingers,
out of her eyes.

00:31:43.134 --> 00:31:48.212
WILL: Let me check. I do. Who am I casting it on?

00:31:48.212 --> 00:31:50.270
LAURA: Our sister.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:55.709
WILL: Oh. Oh, that doesn't look good. Yeah, okay.
Let's see what we can do. I'm sorry, I'm still a

00:31:55.709 --> 00:31:56.800
little sore.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.635
LAURA: No. It's terrible. Please help her.

00:31:58.635 --> 00:32:00.327
WILL: It was a terrible fall. Give me one second.

00:32:00.327 --> 00:32:02.207
MARY: I'm so sorry.

00:32:02.207 --> 00:32:08.022
WILL: Oh. Her? This one? Yeah, all right. Let's do
that. I'm going to cast Revivify.

00:32:08.022 --> 00:32:14.424
MATT: Okay. Unfortunately, she's been dead longer
than a minute, so the spell does not take effect.

00:32:14.424 --> 00:32:20.755
You don't know how long it's been, or if perhaps
your final moments of fucking with her was just

00:32:20.755 --> 00:32:22.190
enough to push it over the edge--

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.168
(laughter)

00:32:24.168 --> 00:32:25.793
WILL: It keeps happening! Sorry.

00:32:25.793 --> 00:32:27.722
SAM: 61 seconds.

00:32:27.722 --> 00:32:30.172
WILL: I can speak to dead, if you'd like to talk
with her.

00:32:30.172 --> 00:32:32.915
LAURA: No! I don't want to fucking talk to her, I
want to have her back!

00:32:32.915 --> 00:32:34.583
(laughter)

00:32:34.583 --> 00:32:37.620
WILL: It's time for one message. Does she owe you
money? I can have her find out where it is.

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.023
LIAM: Do you have anything a little more potent
right now?

00:32:40.023 --> 00:32:42.743
MARISHA: I can raise dead.

00:32:42.743 --> 00:32:44.493
WILL: Well, there we go. See?

00:32:44.493 --> 00:32:45.754
LAURA: Is she going to come back as a zombie?

00:32:45.754 --> 00:32:46.709
MARISHA: No.

00:32:46.709 --> 00:32:47.717
LAURA: She'll be a normal--

00:32:47.717 --> 00:32:48.816
TALIESIN: Just raised.

00:32:48.816 --> 00:32:50.609
MARISHA: I might need some help. Where's Pike?

00:32:50.609 --> 00:32:52.219
WILL: I can raise the dead, too, if you need
help.

00:32:52.219 --> 00:32:54.117
MATT: Pike has been slowly flying down.

00:32:54.117 --> 00:32:56.404
MARISHA: She doesn't come back as a zombie, right?
It's raising dead.

00:32:56.404 --> 00:33:00.092
MATT: Is it the actual Raise Dead spell?

00:33:00.092 --> 00:33:01.523
WILL: Mine is.

00:33:01.523 --> 00:33:05.464
MARISHA: It says three times a day.

00:33:05.464 --> 00:33:10.990
MATT: Raise Dead. You can bring someone back to
life, yeah. It takes an hour to cast.

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:11.969
MARISHA: Yep.

00:33:11.969 --> 00:33:15.575
TRAVIS: Do they murder someone when you do that,
like a horror movie?

00:33:15.575 --> 00:33:18.013
MARISHA: If I did it with Kash, would that--

00:33:18.013 --> 00:33:24.267
WILL: I'm with Zahra now, so let's try to keep
that in mind.

00:33:24.267 --> 00:33:25.924
TALIESIN: Wow, two for two tonight.

00:33:25.924 --> 00:33:27.844
MARISHA: I don't know how to respond to that.

00:33:27.844 --> 00:33:30.506
LIAM: Your sense of humor is your best quality.

00:33:30.506 --> 00:33:31.698
WILL: Isn't it?

00:33:31.698 --> 00:33:32.562
LIAM: Best.

00:33:32.562 --> 00:33:33.910
WILL: We'll get her. She'll be fine!

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:40.543
MATT: As you guys take a moment and realize the
time, the involvement that would be here to do the

00:33:40.543 --> 00:33:45.770
spell, you glance about in the streets of Thar
Amphala, and what straggling undead and/or

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:49.498
cultists seem to have been either trying to
scramble back up to the city or hadn't made their

00:33:49.498 --> 00:33:56.747
way down through or were here as sentinels are
frantically trying to escape and being cut down

00:33:56.747 --> 00:34:02.283
and grabbed by the various eagle riders and the
rest of the army that's currently now beginning to

00:34:02.283 --> 00:34:08.312
swarm in, thanks to the complete falling of the
barrier with the sealing of Vecna. You do feel at

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:12.507
this moment that you do have some time in Thar
Amphala without any immediate danger.

00:34:12.507 --> 00:34:16.628
WILL: But if it gets to that, I can stay and raise
her, and you guys can go and take care of the city.

00:34:16.628 --> 00:34:18.419
LAURA: Thank you.

00:34:18.419 --> 00:34:23.848
MARISHA: I don't even know if I have a full hour
left on my form. That's the only problem. That's

00:34:23.848 --> 00:34:25.158
why I would need help, but--

00:34:25.158 --> 00:34:27.063
WILL: She needs to rest, anyway.

00:34:27.063 --> 00:34:29.015
MARY: I can stay. I'll stay with him.

00:34:29.015 --> 00:34:30.004
LAURA: Thank you.

00:34:30.004 --> 00:34:31.541
MARY: We'll focus on her.

00:34:31.541 --> 00:34:32.871
SAM: We'll all stay, until we don't have to.

00:34:32.871 --> 00:34:33.952
LAURA: Yeah.

00:34:33.952 --> 00:34:35.627
MARISHA: I help Kash as much as I can.

00:34:35.627 --> 00:34:36.529
MATT: Okay.

00:34:36.529 --> 00:34:37.717
LAURA: I sit down and hold her hand.

00:34:37.717 --> 00:34:38.758
MATT: All right.

00:34:38.758 --> 00:34:42.123
LIAM: Start cleaning her cheeks as well as we
can.

00:34:42.123 --> 00:34:44.508
MARISHA: And I don't take my eyes off of Vax the
whole time.

00:34:44.508 --> 00:34:46.142
SAM: Oh, yeah. Shit.

00:34:46.142 --> 00:34:50.194
WILL: I'm holding my medal. Starting the spell.

00:34:50.194 --> 00:34:56.675
MATT: As you guys form a perimeter here at the
base of Entropis, the sky now open, the clouds

00:34:56.675 --> 00:35:01.490
dispelled and scattered, and probably for the
first time in weeks, especially from your guys'

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:08.105
perspective, Vasselheim sees a sky of blue. The
sunlight rains down from above, and the warmth

00:35:08.105 --> 00:35:14.305
that comes through is very comforting as you begin
to clear the space and scrawl out the sigils and

00:35:14.305 --> 00:35:22.564
glyphs necessary for this Raise Dead ritual. As
you're going through the process and you quietly

00:35:22.564 --> 00:35:30.108
begin to focus, you can see some of the eagle
riders and straggling wyvern riders take notice

00:35:30.108 --> 00:35:36.801
and begin to come close, and then stop and keep a
distance, and recognizing the significance of this

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:39.121
moment, respectfully stay away.

00:35:39.121 --> 00:35:44.081
WILL: As he's casting the glyphs, he goes over,
he's about to write the last one, and he walks

00:35:44.081 --> 00:35:50.497
over to Vex, and he takes one tear, and he goes
back over and uses it to do the last glyph.

00:35:50.497 --> 00:35:56.462
MATT: As he draws the last glyph with the tear,
that one seems to have an additional flair, a

00:35:56.462 --> 00:36:03.360
connection, a sparkle of bloodline connectivity
between you and the deceased. As you complete the

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:09.386
spell, I need you to go ahead and bring to this
ritual what you'd like.

00:36:09.386 --> 00:36:13.483
SAM: Oh god.

00:36:13.483 --> 00:36:29.339
LAURA: Jesus, really? Oh, god. I take one of my
arrows that has the owlbear feather on it, and I

00:36:29.339 --> 00:36:32.995
put it down next to her because I know she loved
owlbears.

00:36:32.995 --> 00:36:55.017
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20 for me. Okay.
Anybody else?

00:36:55.017 --> 00:37:09.860
LIAM: I pull Simon from around my waist, and I
start to fasten it around her. This is yours.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:15.417
You're going to have to take care of him now. His
name is Simon. Most people don't think he's alive,

00:37:15.417 --> 00:37:29.734
but they're wrong. He's very much alive. Take care
of him for me. I didn't get nearly enough time

00:37:29.734 --> 00:37:38.029
with you. I'm sorry. I love you very much. I kiss
her on the forehead.

00:37:38.029 --> 00:37:40.410
MATT: Roll another d20.

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:48.102
LIAM: I rolled an 18, but I'm going to use Luck.
Good. 18 is good.

00:37:48.102 --> 00:37:49.536
MATT: Okay.

00:37:49.536 --> 00:38:02.449
MARY: I take the moonstone from my staff, and I
clasp it in my hands, and I say: Sirius, you asked

00:38:02.449 --> 00:38:14.878
me to be here and to judge them. They are worthy.
Give me this boon. Help me save this girl, for

00:38:14.878 --> 00:38:26.739
true friendship, which I never had until now. Help
me save her. Help us all save her. And I place the

00:38:26.739 --> 00:38:29.159
moonstone down next to her head.

00:38:29.159 --> 00:38:31.199
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20 for me.

00:38:31.199 --> 00:38:34.559
MARY: I'll use Luck.

00:38:34.559 --> 00:38:36.461
MATT: If you want to.

00:38:36.461 --> 00:38:38.928
MARY: 12.

00:38:38.928 --> 00:38:50.412
MATT: Okay. As you complete the ritual, all the
sigils in place lighting up, it's unique because

00:38:50.412 --> 00:38:56.308
you're used to the ritual completed by an acolyte
of Sarenrae, in which everything has a glow of

00:38:56.308 --> 00:39:01.839
warmth to it. This ritual was completed by an
acolyte of an entity named Vesh, and as each sigil

00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:08.570
flares, you watch as they darken into the deepest
shadow. It's a yin-yang dichotomy as the spell

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:13.526
begins to take effect, until eventually the whole
circle becomes pitch black, like the deepest of

00:39:13.526 --> 00:39:20.573
lightless midnight. At that moment, you watch as
Velora's form itself is also cast into shadow and

00:39:20.573 --> 00:39:33.510
disappears from view. And for a moment, you fear
she is gone, before the shadow begins to peel away

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:40.511
like a cocoon, and as it tears and rolls back, the
subtle sound of sand shifting and paper crackling,

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:48.081
you watch as her chest begins to move once more,
breathing, her eyes still closed, but life

00:39:48.153 --> 00:39:53.004
breathes into her lungs once more. With a natural
19.

00:39:53.004 --> 00:40:06.103
LAURA: I hug her. Oh, and I pop Trinket out of his
necklace, and I cast Cure Wounds on him so he can

00:40:06.103 --> 00:40:07.487
lick her face.

00:40:07.487 --> 00:40:12.763
MATT: Okay. As Trinket comes out, Trinket is
burned and battered, armor dinged up and screwed

00:40:12.763 --> 00:40:15.707
up, on his face it's askew to one side--

00:40:15.707 --> 00:40:16.933
TRAVIS: He got meteored.

00:40:16.933 --> 00:40:17.974
(laughter)

00:40:17.974 --> 00:40:19.377
MATT: Yeah, he did.

00:40:19.377 --> 00:40:20.854
TRAVIS: I didn't sign up for this shit.

00:40:20.854 --> 00:40:22.718
LAURA: I've still got a 3rd-level Cure Wounds on
him.

00:40:22.718 --> 00:40:24.137
MATT: All right.

00:40:24.137 --> 00:40:27.041
MARY: I cast Beast Speak. You all right, Trinket?

00:40:27.041 --> 00:40:33.491
MATT: "I don't care." And Trinket comes forward to
Velora and begins licking her face, and she who is

00:40:33.491 --> 00:40:40.970
breathing but unconscious, the eye begins to
slowly open. "What?" And her eyes open up a little

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:47.065
bit, and you can see her skin darkened from the
blast and the rubble and the dust that's now begun

00:40:47.065 --> 00:40:52.373
to settle around the base of Entropis, and she
looks up and first sees the lapping tongue of

00:40:52.373 --> 00:40:56.843
Trinket against her cheek, and giggles and pushes
him away a little bit. Then she sees the feather

00:40:56.843 --> 00:41:00.896
and looks at it and now looks up to see the person
that's holding her and looks and meets both of

00:41:00.896 --> 00:41:03.699
your gazes--

00:41:03.699 --> 00:41:06.125
LAURA: Hi, little monkey.

00:41:06.125 --> 00:41:08.341
MATT: "Hi."

00:41:08.341 --> 00:41:12.873
LIAM: You're an awfully long way from home.

00:41:12.873 --> 00:41:15.672
MATT: "What happened?"

00:41:15.672 --> 00:41:18.266
LAURA: You went on an adventure, that's all.

00:41:18.266 --> 00:41:28.966
MATT: She gets quiet for a second, trying to
remember, trying to recall. "I'm very tired."

00:41:28.966 --> 00:41:30.965
LAURA: Of course.

00:41:30.965 --> 00:41:35.317
MATT: And she curls up and pulls tighter around
Vex's neck.

00:41:35.317 --> 00:41:38.883
WILL: Kash steps in. You don't feel evil, do you?

00:41:38.883 --> 00:41:41.490
(laughter)

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:47.441
MATT: She pulls back and looks over at you. "Who's
this human?"

00:41:47.441 --> 00:41:51.730
LAURA: Oh, he saved your life just now, dear.

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:53.371
LIAM: He's a friend. Come here.

00:41:53.371 --> 00:41:55.311
WILL: All right.

00:41:55.311 --> 00:42:00.059
LAURA: No, but seriously, could she be evil?
Seriously.

00:42:00.059 --> 00:42:04.314
WILL: No, there's-- no. You feel okay?

00:42:04.314 --> 00:42:09.227
MATT: She arranges the situation and looks back at
you and goes, (giggles).

00:42:09.227 --> 00:42:11.965
WILL: She's fine. I'd watch her.

00:42:11.965 --> 00:42:14.149
LAURA: Yeah. She's fine.

00:42:14.149 --> 00:42:16.115
(laughter)

00:42:16.115 --> 00:42:21.191
MATT: She pulls back into you and whispers in your
ear and says, "He's pretty stupid, isn't he?"

00:42:21.191 --> 00:42:23.717
LAURA: He's really stupid.

00:42:23.717 --> 00:42:26.257
MATT: She giggles and then sighs into you.

00:42:26.257 --> 00:42:34.688
LAURA: Okay, yeah. Just rest. I'm going to sit her
on top of Trinket so she can take a little

00:42:34.688 --> 00:42:35.763
nappy-nap.

00:42:35.763 --> 00:42:40.064
MATT: Okay. And she passes right out. She is
spent. She is exhausted.

00:42:40.064 --> 00:42:46.679
WILL: The city is still burning.

00:42:46.679 --> 00:42:50.072
MARY: Yes, it is. We have work to do.

00:42:50.072 --> 00:42:52.273
WILL: We've got a lot of people down there we
know.

00:42:52.273 --> 00:43:00.252
MARY: I know. The Slayer's Take is in desperate
need. We should check on the sphinx.

00:43:00.252 --> 00:43:03.849
TRAVIS: The sphinx, right.

00:43:03.849 --> 00:43:07.203
LAURA: We can't thank you enough. Again.

00:43:07.203 --> 00:43:12.202
WILL: You guys always do throw the best parties,
that's for sure.

00:43:12.202 --> 00:43:13.228
MARY: Yes, you do.

00:43:13.228 --> 00:43:14.561
LAURA: I'm so glad you're all right.

00:43:14.561 --> 00:43:19.281
WILL: Yeah, I'm glad we could help. That's why
we're going to name our child Vax.

00:43:19.281 --> 00:43:22.168
I'm totally kidding; that's never going to happen.

00:43:22.168 --> 00:43:25.145
(laughter)

00:43:25.145 --> 00:43:37.832
MARY: Take the moonstone. Keep it with you. If you
need me-- well, I won't come, because I'll be

00:43:37.832 --> 00:43:38.912
away, but--

00:43:38.912 --> 00:43:41.138
LAURA: Yeah, you'll be a little busy with the
child and all.

00:43:41.138 --> 00:43:45.372
MARY: A little busy, yes. But come and visit if
you get a chance. Who knows? Twins runs in my

00:43:45.372 --> 00:43:47.089
family, so you never know.

00:43:47.089 --> 00:43:48.560
LAURA: Really?

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.853
MARY: Yes. Lillith told me. I need to see Lillith
again.

00:43:51.853 --> 00:43:53.305
LIAM: Oh, the joke's on you.

00:43:53.305 --> 00:43:54.781
LAURA: I give her a big hug.

00:43:54.781 --> 00:43:55.785
MARY: I love you, darling.

00:43:55.785 --> 00:43:57.116
LAURA: I love you so much. Congratulations.

00:43:57.116 --> 00:44:00.667
MARY: Thank you, dearest. Scanlan.

00:44:00.667 --> 00:44:01.845
SAM: Yes?

00:44:01.845 --> 00:44:02.943
MARY: You little bastard.

00:44:02.943 --> 00:44:06.771
SAM: Yes? That is my full name, yes.

00:44:06.771 --> 00:44:07.878
(laughter)

00:44:07.878 --> 00:44:13.474
MARY: I plant a giant, fiery kiss on him, and my
tail wraps around his head.

00:44:13.474 --> 00:44:14.730
SAM: I try to get away, but--

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:16.027
MARY: The tail.

00:44:16.027 --> 00:44:17.581
(laughter)

00:44:17.581 --> 00:44:18.579
WILL: I told you.

00:44:18.579 --> 00:44:25.105
SAM: You're right! Kinky. Ooh! What? I mean, thank
you?

00:44:25.105 --> 00:44:26.970
MARY: I miss doing your hair.

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:31.911
SAM: Well, I miss doing, well--

00:44:31.911 --> 00:44:37.251
MARY: We'll see each other, again, I hope. Grog.

00:44:37.251 --> 00:44:38.043
TRAVIS: Yeah?

00:44:38.043 --> 00:44:40.331
MARY: Use that moonhammer.

00:44:40.331 --> 00:44:41.579
TRAVIS: I will-- I mean, again.

00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:42.740
LAURA: At night. In the night.

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:43.632
MARY: Use it in the moon--

00:44:43.632 --> 00:44:44.487
TRAVIS: Yeah. Under the moon.

00:44:44.487 --> 00:44:45.357
LAURA: Yeah, obviously.

00:44:45.357 --> 00:44:47.088
TRAVIS: It's called a moonhammer. Yeah.

00:44:47.088 --> 00:44:48.745
MARY: Use it in the moonlight. I think you'll be
surprised.

00:44:48.745 --> 00:44:49.919
TRAVIS: In the nude.

00:44:49.919 --> 00:44:51.311
TALIESIN and MARY: Without pants.

00:44:51.311 --> 00:44:55.613
TRAVIS: Right. Yeah. Moon for moon, as above, so
below--

00:44:55.613 --> 00:44:56.704
MARY: Yes.

00:44:56.704 --> 00:44:58.114
TRAVIS: And that will unleash--

00:44:58.114 --> 00:44:59.808
MARY: Take your pants off, here we go.

00:44:59.808 --> 00:45:02.623
LIAM: Double damage on cows. Yeah.

00:45:02.623 --> 00:45:04.306
TRAVIS: I'm going to fuck some cows up.

00:45:04.306 --> 00:45:05.553
MARY: Yeah, you do.

00:45:05.553 --> 00:45:08.755
WILL: Oh, Grog. I love standing next to you in
battle and hate standing next to you at the

00:45:08.755 --> 00:45:09.591
urinal.

00:45:09.591 --> 00:45:11.955
(laughter)

00:45:11.955 --> 00:45:14.270
WILL: That's just the way it is, my friend. Been a
pleasure.

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:16.692
MARY: Percy.

00:45:16.692 --> 00:45:17.602
TALIESIN: Yes?

00:45:17.602 --> 00:45:21.645
MARY: Take care of our girl.

00:45:21.645 --> 00:45:22.940
TALIESIN: I'll try.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:24.672
MARY: Take care of her.

00:45:24.672 --> 00:45:26.325
TALIESIN: My regards to your family.

00:45:26.325 --> 00:45:31.481
MARY: Thank you, love. We'll be in Whitestone
again soon. I'll see you soon, dearest.

00:45:31.481 --> 00:45:38.054
SAM: Don't see us too soon. I mean, whenever
you're near us, you both almost die. So maybe just--

00:45:38.054 --> 00:45:39.104
LAURA: Give it some time.

00:45:39.104 --> 00:45:40.110
WILL: But we--

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:41.622
WILL and MARY: Almost.

00:45:41.622 --> 00:45:47.899
MARY: That's the key word is &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt;, you see.
Yes. You saved our lives. We can never repay you.

00:45:47.899 --> 00:45:50.758
TRAVIS: I believe you saved ours first by showing
up.

00:45:50.758 --> 00:45:57.510
MARISHA: We saved each other. That's kind of what
Vox Machina's all about.

00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:59.568
LIAM: This is the second time around you.

00:45:59.568 --> 00:46:05.609
MARY: That's what we do for each other.
I love you, Vax.

00:46:05.648 --> 00:46:07.877
LIAM: I love you, too, Mary.

00:46:07.877 --> 00:46:10.897
MARY: Oh, baby, don't do that.

00:46:10.897 --> 00:46:16.867
MATT: At this point, you begin to hear distant
horns echoing throughout the city streets.

00:46:16.867 --> 00:46:33.453
Distant, emanating throughout. As you glance over,
you haven't heard these horns before. But they

00:46:33.453 --> 00:46:43.430
sound less like horns of warning and more like
horns of victory. Glancing down in the streets,

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:49.358
there are still flames and columns of smoke and you
can still see scuffles beneath. The siege weaponry

00:46:49.358 --> 00:46:58.070
attacks against the titan have subsided and it has
not moved at all. It is locked in place, a large

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:05.527
statuesque-like mountain of an ancient entity now
lording over the edge of the Braving Grounds,

00:47:05.527 --> 00:47:11.360
almost creeping upon the outskirts of the Quad
Roads towards the center of the city, leaving a

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:17.786
path of destruction in its wake. Most of the
Braving Grounds is in tatters but--

00:47:17.786 --> 00:47:20.585
LAURA: I look at Percy. This would be a wonderful
place for a summer home.

00:47:20.585 --> 00:47:22.288
(chuckles)

00:47:22.288 --> 00:47:25.191
WILL and MARY: We've got to go.

00:47:25.191 --> 00:47:26.347
SAM: What? No.

00:47:26.347 --> 00:47:27.637
MARY: We have to leave.

00:47:27.637 --> 00:47:28.936
WILL: They need us back.

00:47:28.936 --> 00:47:29.864
MARY: Yeah.

00:47:29.864 --> 00:47:31.104
LIAM: Don't be strangers, though.

00:47:31.104 --> 00:47:32.274
MARY: We won't.

00:47:32.274 --> 00:47:33.249
LIAM: Look in.

00:47:33.249 --> 00:47:34.317
LAURA: Thank you, guys.

00:47:34.317 --> 00:47:35.110
MARY: We will.

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:36.322
LIAM: Look in if you can.

00:47:36.322 --> 00:47:37.427
MARY: We love you all so much.

00:47:37.427 --> 00:47:38.281
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:47:38.281 --> 00:47:39.072
TALIESIN: Thank you, as well.

00:47:39.072 --> 00:47:40.682
WILL: So this is what it's like to have a family,
huh?

00:47:40.682 --> 00:47:41.691
MARY: Yeah.

00:47:41.691 --> 00:47:42.853
WILL: I can get used to that.

00:47:42.853 --> 00:47:44.398
MARISHA: Sounds like you're going to have an
actual family soon.

00:47:44.398 --> 00:47:51.939
SAM: Well I shit more than your kid will, but
other than that, it's like this but with less shit.

00:47:51.939 --> 00:47:54.321
WILL: Then we'll be happy.

00:47:54.321 --> 00:47:55.786
MARY: Always.

00:47:55.786 --> 00:47:57.984
WILL: Call us if you need us. Anytime.

00:47:57.984 --> 00:47:58.728
LAURA: Same.

00:47:58.728 --> 00:47:59.932
MARY: We'll be here.

00:47:59.932 --> 00:48:00.925
LAURA: All right.

00:48:00.925 --> 00:48:01.863
MARY: Thank you.

00:48:01.863 --> 00:48:02.915
WILL: Luck in battle.

00:48:02.915 --> 00:48:03.693
SAM: Thank you.

00:48:03.693 --> 00:48:04.682
LAURA: Bye loves.

00:48:04.682 --> 00:48:05.905
LIAM: See you later, smart ass.

00:48:05.905 --> 00:48:06.880
MARY: Thank you.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.120
WILL: Bastard. Treat her well or I'm going to come
back.

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.665
LAURA: Hey, you've got your hands full, all
right?

00:48:10.665 --> 00:48:11.983
WILL: That's true, too.

00:48:11.983 --> 00:48:21.982
MATT: And as she completes a secondary Fly spell,
these two coast off over the edge of Thar Amphala,

00:48:21.982 --> 00:48:36.002
down into the center of Vasselheim on their own.
At which point, you notice three battle-disheveled

00:48:36.002 --> 00:48:42.570
wyvern riders that were waiting at the side begin
to approach. One of them you recognize as a

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:48.354
captain signified by these ivory horns that curl
out of the back of the helmet and grow longer than

00:48:48.354 --> 00:48:53.114
the regular wyvern riders' armor you've
encountered. Having stepped off the armored drake

00:48:53.114 --> 00:48:58.452
that currently waits, shaking its head, large
leathery wings dug into the nearby rubble, the

00:48:58.452 --> 00:49:02.939
warrior approaches, pulling the helmet off,
revealing a tumble of braided amber hair with

00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:09.672
shaved sides and a rather stern-looking woman that
you don't recognise. "Vox Machina! I am Captain

00:49:09.672 --> 00:49:17.173
"Obelin. I would ask, does this shift in tide
signify anything? Does the lich still loom about?"

00:49:17.173 --> 00:49:20.284
LAURA: He fucking dead.

00:49:20.284 --> 00:49:23.879
TALIESIN: Does not. The battle is won.

00:49:23.879 --> 00:49:26.623
LAURA: He's been sealed away.

00:49:26.623 --> 00:49:29.007
MATT: "It is done?"

00:49:29.007 --> 00:49:30.172
TRAVIS: It is.

00:49:30.172 --> 00:49:31.591
TALIESIN: "Fucking dead."

00:49:31.591 --> 00:49:34.034
(laughter)

00:49:34.034 --> 00:49:35.479
TRAVIS: Lady Vex'ahlia.

00:49:35.479 --> 00:49:36.865
TALIESIN: Lady, yes.

00:49:36.865 --> 00:49:45.778
MATT: "The gods grant their grace upon Vasselheim
still. We thank you. Well, there's little time to

00:49:45.778 --> 00:49:53.854
"celebrate. There's still much to be done, but
please bring this information to the Platinum

00:49:53.854 --> 00:49:59.941
"Sanctuary, to somewhere of significance in the
city. This information needs to go out. this will

00:49:59.941 --> 00:50:02.851
"greatly bolster the ranks, morale of those--"

00:50:02.851 --> 00:50:06.244
MARISHA: Start spreading the word yourself. You
can help us out, right?

00:50:06.244 --> 00:50:09.254
MATT: "Oh, we shall." She looks over her shoulder
at the other soldiers.

00:50:09.254 --> 00:50:12.236
TALIESIN: I've got the last flare from Whitestone
from all those years ago.

00:50:12.236 --> 00:50:16.493
LAURA: I have a purple flare too. We should all
set them off.

00:50:16.493 --> 00:50:18.583
MARISHA: I was going to say: I think I still have
a Skywrite.

00:50:18.583 --> 00:50:19.704
SAM: Let's do it.

00:50:19.704 --> 00:50:20.525
MARISHA: Yep.

00:50:20.525 --> 00:50:21.496
LAURA: I send up my purple flare, too.

00:50:21.496 --> 00:50:22.391
SAM: I pull out my gun.

00:50:22.391 --> 00:50:24.017
(laughter)

00:50:24.017 --> 00:50:25.707
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:50:25.707 --> 00:50:26.883
MARISHA: Oh my god!

00:50:26.883 --> 00:50:27.960
TRAVIS: I forgot you have one.

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:29.093
LIAM: What a callback.

00:50:29.093 --> 00:50:30.527
TALIESIN: I've been waiting for it.

00:50:30.527 --> 00:50:32.381
TRAVIS: Please misfire. Please blow your hand
off.

00:50:32.381 --> 00:50:34.390
SAM: Let's do this. (yells)

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:35.745
(laughter)

00:50:35.745 --> 00:50:37.848
MATT: Okay. Roll a d20.

00:50:37.848 --> 00:50:39.582
TRAVIS: Please.

00:50:39.582 --> 00:50:40.620
TALIESIN: No!

00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:41.777
SAM: Natural 20.

00:50:41.777 --> 00:50:42.611
TALIESIN: No!

00:50:42.611 --> 00:50:45.626
SAM: (machine gun noises)

00:50:45.626 --> 00:50:49.615
LIAM: Say hello to my even littler friend!

00:50:49.615 --> 00:50:51.932
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

00:50:51.932 --> 00:50:57.160
MATT: So as you guys send up your colored
Whitestone crest flares into the sky, what do you

00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:58.362
Skywrite?

00:50:58.362 --> 00:50:59.802
MARISHA: Vecna defeated.

00:50:59.802 --> 00:51:01.360
LAURA: That's a lot of writing.

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:02.275
TALIESIN: That's a lot of words.

00:51:02.275 --> 00:51:03.932
MATT: The wisps of cloud begin to spell across--

00:51:03.932 --> 00:51:05.179
SAM: V def.

00:51:05.179 --> 00:51:08.348
MARISHA: (laughs) I can write it out.

00:51:08.348 --> 00:51:09.642
TALIESIN: You can.

00:51:09.642 --> 00:51:15.392
MATT: Yeah. As it coasts across, you hear this
loud echoing (gunshot) as the N in the middle of

00:51:15.392 --> 00:51:20.164
Vecna seems to dissipate with a little puff as a
perfectly aimed bullet from one pistol that does

00:51:20.164 --> 00:51:23.462
not backfire, because that would have been fucking
funny.

00:51:23.462 --> 00:51:25.569
TALIESIN: It's all I wanted tonight.

00:51:25.569 --> 00:51:26.844
TRAVIS: So good.

00:51:26.844 --> 00:51:30.005
MATT: Roll a performance check.

00:51:30.005 --> 00:51:32.386
SAM: Performance? Come on. 28.

00:51:32.386 --> 00:51:38.148
MATT: 28. For a man who has only shot a pistol
once, he Revolver Ocelots that shit.

00:51:38.148 --> 00:51:40.776
LAURA: He's been practicing that shit in his
bedroom.

00:51:40.776 --> 00:51:42.461
MARISHA: Yeah. In the mirror.

00:51:42.461 --> 00:51:44.330
TRAVIS: Behind the back. Oh shit.

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:46.045
(laughter)

00:51:46.045 --> 00:51:49.979
SAM: I've been watching you.

00:51:49.979 --> 00:51:53.145
TRAVIS: Percy's like, "I don't do that shit."

00:51:53.145 --> 00:51:55.055
(laughter)

00:51:55.055 --> 00:51:56.796
TALIESIN: Yeah, no.

00:51:56.796 --> 00:52:02.439
MATT: These flares bursting and slowly descending,
coming down and bringing this-- it was a purple

00:52:02.439 --> 00:52:03.992
flare and what was the color of yours?

00:52:03.992 --> 00:52:05.682
TALIESIN: Gold, if I recall.

00:52:05.682 --> 00:52:09.921
MATT: So gold and purple begin to burn down below,
giving this strange atmospheric light to the

00:52:09.921 --> 00:52:15.614
outside of the large, still titan form as the
words across the sky, you begin to hear this low

00:52:15.614 --> 00:52:23.067
gathering of cheers. Thousands upon thousands upon
thousands of voices where you once heard screaming

00:52:23.067 --> 00:52:28.549
and yelling now join in unison. A rallying cry of
victory that crawls across the entirety of

00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:35.196
Vasselheim around you on all sides. What do you
guys want to do?

00:52:35.196 --> 00:52:41.831
TRAVIS: I &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; that hand.

00:52:41.831 --> 00:52:45.828
SAM: Do we have Locate Object or something?

00:52:45.828 --> 00:52:46.888
LIAM: I do.

00:52:46.888 --> 00:52:48.754
LAURA: I mean, yeah.

00:52:48.754 --> 00:52:51.193
SAM: Is it an object? I guess it's inanimate now.

00:52:51.193 --> 00:52:53.022
MATT: It is considered an object now.

00:52:53.022 --> 00:52:54.123
LIAM: I do.

00:52:54.123 --> 00:52:54.941
LAURA: That's good.

00:52:54.941 --> 00:52:57.115
LIAM: I got it. I've seen it. I have the spell
slot.

00:52:57.115 --> 00:53:02.326
MATT: All right. So you cast Locate Object and you
have a very strong vision of the direction and

00:53:02.326 --> 00:53:06.491
it's maybe a hundred feet to your left, and it is
under quite a bit of rubble.

00:53:06.491 --> 00:53:08.403
LIAM: Big man, come on. I'm going to need you to
dig; it's over here.

00:53:08.403 --> 00:53:09.494
TRAVIS: Not a problem.

00:53:09.494 --> 00:53:10.512
MATT: All right.

00:53:10.512 --> 00:53:11.622
SAM: Rage dig.

00:53:11.622 --> 00:53:19.976
MATT: Giving him direction. Rage-digging through,
tossing veritable small boulders with one-handed

00:53:19.976 --> 00:53:25.308
scoops. You guys are having to dodge out of the
way as they go flying by and skidding to a halt

00:53:25.308 --> 00:53:33.758
maybe 50, 60 feet behind him. Go ahead and make an
investigation check with advantage, because of his aid.

00:53:33.758 --> 00:53:39.983
TRAVIS: That's about as good as it gets, because
that's even worse. 16.

00:53:39.983 --> 00:53:41.457
MATT: 16. Okay.

00:53:41.457 --> 00:53:42.593
TRAVIS: With a minus two.

00:53:42.593 --> 00:53:45.714
MATT: It takes you a little while, but thanks to
Locate Object, you cruise through and you

00:53:45.714 --> 00:53:54.655
eventually find-- It's been smashed, but it's still
intact and there you see the completely cut off,

00:53:54.655 --> 00:53:58.964
red-scaled, clawed hand of Arkhan the Cruel.

00:53:58.964 --> 00:54:01.783
TRAVIS: He fucked us.

00:54:01.783 --> 00:54:03.812
MARISHA, SAM, and LIAM: Yeah.

00:54:03.812 --> 00:54:07.432
LAURA: He helped us. And then he fucked us. Yeah.

00:54:07.432 --> 00:54:14.098
MARISHA: I guess the help was worth the fucking,
but only a little bit.

00:54:14.098 --> 00:54:15.149
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:54:15.149 --> 00:54:21.360
MATT: The voice creeps into your head. "Take it.
Find him. He has to die."

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:26.715
TRAVIS: Feel like I should take this and try and
find him. He's got to fucking die.

00:54:26.715 --> 00:54:30.128
LAURA: Yeah, he probably does.

00:54:30.128 --> 00:54:37.717
TRAVIS: He was so cool and strong and only his
physique rivals my own, but I feel like he's got

00:54:37.717 --> 00:54:38.829
to die.

00:54:38.829 --> 00:54:40.730
LIAM: Please. He couldn't touch you, are you
kidding?

00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:42.157
MARISHA: You know, you're not having--

00:54:42.157 --> 00:54:43.406
TRAVIS: Couldn't.

00:54:43.406 --> 00:54:47.180
LAURA: You seem to like him a lot. Are you sure
you want to kill him and not just try to get--

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:48.425
MARISHA: Grog.

00:54:48.425 --> 00:54:49.855
TRAVIS: What? Hold on.

00:54:49.855 --> 00:54:56.700
MARISHA: We all think you're strong. You don't
need to have an inferiority complex.

00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:58.067
TRAVIS: A what?

00:54:58.067 --> 00:55:00.398
LAURA: Yeah, I don't think he's going to
understand.

00:55:00.398 --> 00:55:02.163
LIAM: I don't think he has those.

00:55:02.163 --> 00:55:06.532
TRAVIS: So he's a paladin of--

00:55:06.532 --> 00:55:07.565
SAM: Tiamat.

00:55:07.565 --> 00:55:09.394
TRAVIS: Right. Is that a good or a bad?

00:55:09.394 --> 00:55:11.252
SAM: Bad, I'm guessing?

00:55:11.252 --> 00:55:16.984
MATT: Make a religion check with advantage because
you still have-- well, the blessing would have

00:55:16.984 --> 00:55:18.194
worn off.

00:55:18.194 --> 00:55:21.282
LIAM: That thing could rot. Do you know what
preserves a hand?

00:55:21.282 --> 00:55:22.278
LAURA: The bag of colding.

00:55:22.278 --> 00:55:23.530
SAM: More than 20.

00:55:23.530 --> 00:55:28.093
MATT: Yeah, Tiamat's very bad. Known as the Scaled
Tyrant, she resides in the Nine Hells and is the

00:55:28.093 --> 00:55:30.809
patron deity of all chromatic dragons.

00:55:30.809 --> 00:55:35.971
SAM: Oh, yeah. She's the dragon god. She?

00:55:35.971 --> 00:55:38.669
MATT: She. The opposite of Bahamut.

00:55:38.669 --> 00:55:41.239
TRAVIS: Of good dragons, or bad?

00:55:41.239 --> 00:55:42.332
SAM: Bad dragons.

00:55:42.332 --> 00:55:49.466
TRAVIS: Okay. I feel like he had a good insight,
but the hand does bad things, right?

00:55:49.466 --> 00:55:59.482
LAURA: The hand does really bad things. You know
what you should do is bring that to Bahamut.

00:55:59.482 --> 00:56:01.047
LIAM: Yeah, after you piss on it.

00:56:01.047 --> 00:56:05.322
MARISHA: Why are you so connected to the pissing
thing?

00:56:05.322 --> 00:56:07.536
LAURA: Don't piss on it, Grog.

00:56:07.536 --> 00:56:08.961
TRAVIS: But he said preserve it.

00:56:08.961 --> 00:56:12.401
LAURA: But then maybe if they try to use the hand
to find it, it might lead them to you instead

00:56:12.401 --> 00:56:14.278
because you've already pissed on it.

00:56:14.278 --> 00:56:15.723
TRAVIS: Lead them to my junk?

00:56:15.723 --> 00:56:16.850
LAURA: Potentially.

00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:18.250
TRAVIS: People have come looking for it for less.

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:20.718
LAURA: You don't want people chopping off your
junk thinking your junk is Vecna's hand, do you?

00:56:20.718 --> 00:56:26.571
TRAVIS: It doesn't even look like a hand. Just
like one really big middle finger.

00:56:26.571 --> 00:56:27.940
(laughter)

00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:29.420
LIAM: It's like a mole, right?

00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:38.119
TRAVIS: Yeah. All right, I have it. I'm not going
to preserve it.

00:56:38.119 --> 00:56:40.623
LAURA: Put it in the bag of colding.

00:56:40.623 --> 00:56:42.531
LIAM: Such a mistake.

00:56:42.531 --> 00:56:44.494
SAM: That's on the to-do list. We'll go find him.

00:56:44.494 --> 00:56:46.169
LAURA: All right.

00:56:46.169 --> 00:56:48.563
TRAVIS: And Bahamut is the platinum--

00:56:48.563 --> 00:56:50.990
LAURA: Tiamat's the bad guy.

00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:55.178
TRAVIS: No, Bahamut is the good dragon of the
platinum variety?

00:56:55.178 --> 00:56:56.523
ALL: Yes.

00:56:56.523 --> 00:56:58.075
TRAVIS: Would you say they are at odds?

00:56:58.075 --> 00:56:59.153
TALIESIN and SAM: Yes.

00:56:59.153 --> 00:57:00.025
LIAM: Safe bet.

00:57:00.025 --> 00:57:01.381
TRAVIS: Like Godzilla and King Kong?

00:57:01.381 --> 00:57:04.025
LIAM: I don't know those references, but yeah,
they are at odds.

00:57:04.025 --> 00:57:06.857
MARISHA: What's-her-name worshipped Bahamut.

00:57:06.857 --> 00:57:08.170
LAURA: Kima.

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:12.304
MARISHA: Was it Kima? Kima! Kima worships
Bahamut.

00:57:12.304 --> 00:57:13.484
TRAVIS: She was badass.

00:57:13.484 --> 00:57:14.525
LIAM and LAURA: Yes.

00:57:14.525 --> 00:57:17.808
TRAVIS: I'll just hold on to the hand right now.

00:57:17.808 --> 00:57:19.667
LAURA: What's going on there, Grog?

00:57:19.667 --> 00:57:22.736
TRAVIS: Nothing. We just had a big fight.

00:57:22.736 --> 00:57:28.003
TALIESIN: You're making that monologue face. Like
that face someone makes when they're listening to

00:57:28.003 --> 00:57:33.422
some very complex internal monologue. You don't
make that face very often. You're making it right

00:57:33.422 --> 00:57:39.171
now. Just start speaking whatever's in your head
right now. Free-form.

00:57:39.171 --> 00:57:42.838
TRAVIS: I have to go after the hand, I must kill
Vecna, I have to do these things.

00:57:42.838 --> 00:57:49.487
TALIESIN: Okay, this is starting to paint a
picture. You feel better now?

00:57:49.487 --> 00:57:50.538
TRAVIS: Nuh-huh.

00:57:50.538 --> 00:57:51.549
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:57:51.549 --> 00:57:54.039
MARISHA: Is that going on all the time in your
head?

00:57:54.039 --> 00:57:54.965
TRAVIS: No.

00:57:54.965 --> 00:57:55.802
MARISHA: Okay.

00:57:55.802 --> 00:57:57.235
TALIESIN: Are you lying right now?

00:57:57.235 --> 00:57:58.615
SAM: He nodded when he said no.

00:57:58.615 --> 00:58:04.920
LIAM: DM, just for funsies, do I sense Vecna in
any way, shape, or form?

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.435
MATT: No.

00:58:06.435 --> 00:58:09.166
LIAM: Okay. Definitely want to piss on that hand,
Grog.

00:58:09.166 --> 00:58:15.849
LAURA: Don't piss on the hand. Number one: it's
already in the bag of colding and I don't want

00:58:15.849 --> 00:58:17.129
everything else pissed on.

00:58:17.129 --> 00:58:18.637
LIAM: Grog and I don't share much!

00:58:18.637 --> 00:58:20.010
TALIESIN: Except pissing?

00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:22.786
(laughter)

00:58:22.786 --> 00:58:26.681
TALIESIN: It was an honest question.

00:58:26.681 --> 00:58:30.390
TRAVIS: That's true.

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:31.899
LAURA: What should we do, you guys?

00:58:31.899 --> 00:58:33.634
TALIESIN: I'm so tired.

00:58:33.634 --> 00:58:36.769
MARISHA: I grab onto Vax and don't let go.

00:58:36.769 --> 00:58:39.631
SAM: We have more pressing concerns.

00:58:39.631 --> 00:58:41.713
TALIESIN: That does remind me. Scanlan?

00:58:41.713 --> 00:58:43.863
SAM: What?

00:58:43.863 --> 00:58:46.040
TALIESIN: You're going to have to give it back
now.

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.020
SAM: Give what back?

00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:49.510
TALIESIN: You know exactly what.

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:52.921
SAM: The gun?

00:58:52.921 --> 00:58:53.908
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:58:53.908 --> 00:58:55.101
TRAVIS: That was part of a trade.

00:58:55.101 --> 00:58:56.068
SAM: This is my gun.

00:58:56.068 --> 00:58:57.161
TALIESIN: I don't think it's your gun.

00:58:57.161 --> 00:58:58.207
SAM: I found it.

00:58:58.207 --> 00:58:58.984
TALIESIN: You didn't.

00:58:58.984 --> 00:59:07.169
TRAVIS: No, there was a trade of items. I got a
cloak of smashing out of it, and you got... other stuff.

00:59:07.169 --> 00:59:09.039
SAM: I found it fair and square; it's my gun.

00:59:09.039 --> 00:59:13.904
TALIESIN: There's no fair and square. And
honestly, if you were anybody else, I would find

00:59:13.904 --> 00:59:20.572
it when I was rummaging through your corpse later.
But it's you. So instead I just use my words, and

00:59:20.572 --> 00:59:27.438
I'm trying to be a better person. If you really
like it, maybe we'll have a special one made

00:59:27.438 --> 00:59:31.358
that's a little safer. But not that one. That's
one of mine.

00:59:31.358 --> 00:59:35.719
SAM: I look so cool.

00:59:35.719 --> 00:59:42.682
TALIESIN: I'll make you something fancy that's a
little less prone to explode.

00:59:42.682 --> 00:59:46.779
LIAM: Scanlan, you should know you always look
cool. Always.

00:59:46.779 --> 00:59:48.818
TALIESIN: Especially with the head thing. It's
quite nice.

00:59:48.818 --> 00:59:52.120
MARISHA: Yeah, this is awesome. Does he still have
the blessing?

00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.485
MATT: The blessing has faded by now.

00:59:53.485 --> 00:59:56.074
TALIESIN: You should get that tattooed in
permanently.

00:59:56.074 --> 00:59:57.149
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:59:57.149 --> 00:59:58.467
SAM: That's a good idea.

00:59:58.467 --> 00:59:59.673
TALIESIN: That's a really good idea.

00:59:59.673 --> 01:00:03.019
MARISHA: I can draw on you with the remaining
remnants. That way you have it there, always.

01:00:03.019 --> 01:00:04.400
SAM: I love it.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:10.779
MARISHA: Okay. I try to draw the outline of the
remaining glyph on his head.

01:00:10.779 --> 01:00:17.017
MATT: So you take some ash and charcoal from the
nearby rubble and loosely draw the symbol on his

01:00:17.017 --> 01:00:19.647
forehead. Roll a dexterity check.

01:00:19.647 --> 01:00:27.538
MARISHA: Okay. Straight dex? Don't fuck me, Gil!
14.

01:00:27.538 --> 01:00:29.374
MATT: 14. It's passable.

01:00:29.374 --> 01:00:35.125
MARISHA: Yeah, that right there. That's perfect.
Get that tattooed.

01:00:35.125 --> 01:00:40.540
SAM: All right. It's going to happen. I feel like
we should all get a tattoo to commemorate this.

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:42.176
TALIESIN: On the forehead?

01:00:42.176 --> 01:00:43.786
LAURA and MARISHA: Definitely on the forehead.

01:00:43.786 --> 01:00:47.444
LIAM: Well, maybe in different places. We don't all
need to get it in the same place. Maybe on a

01:00:47.503 --> 01:00:49.731
theme, but not the &lt;i&gt;exact&lt;/i&gt; same thing?

01:00:49.731 --> 01:00:51.752
LAURA: We already all got tattoos, didn't we?

01:00:51.752 --> 01:00:54.183
TALIESIN: Well, &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; got tattoos. That's all that
matters.

01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:55.913
TRAVIS: No, we didn't.

01:00:55.913 --> 01:00:57.836
MARISHA: I'm not sure what we're talking about
anymore.

01:00:57.836 --> 01:01:01.465
LAURA: No, I thought we got them in character.

01:01:01.465 --> 01:01:03.068
MARISHA: No, &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; got them.

01:01:03.068 --> 01:01:05.370
LIAM: I got one. And I got one.

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.448
LAURA: Oh, we got the Slayer's Take.

01:01:07.448 --> 01:01:11.881
MARISHA: Wait, we're branded, and then I've got
mine, and then he has his.

01:01:11.881 --> 01:01:18.696
LIAM: I have the burnt hand on my back. Elven. No,
it's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; mostly healed. Scanlan Shorthalt! You

01:01:18.696 --> 01:01:23.418
don't need a gun to look cool. You are the Meat
Man. You are Burt Reynolds. You are a fucking hero.

01:01:23.418 --> 01:01:27.585
SAM: I'm going to throw it away. Wrist Pocket!

01:01:27.585 --> 01:01:29.931
(laughter)

01:01:29.931 --> 01:01:33.045
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

01:01:33.045 --> 01:01:36.445
SAM: Nine. 12.

01:01:36.445 --> 01:01:38.017
MATT: 12?

01:01:38.017 --> 01:01:41.397
MARISHA: Bullshit! My passive perception is 21.

01:01:41.397 --> 01:01:45.281
MATT: Yeah, you guys totally see him. It's the
worst example--

01:01:45.281 --> 01:01:49.986
LIAM: That's the trick I do for my
eight-year-old!

01:01:49.986 --> 01:01:54.374
TALIESIN: Look at it go! Wow!

01:01:54.374 --> 01:01:59.298
(laughter)

01:01:59.298 --> 01:02:00.984
TRAVIS: You caught it?! You threw it--

01:02:00.984 --> 01:02:02.195
SAM: Around the world.

01:02:02.195 --> 01:02:03.190
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:05.422
(laughter)

01:02:05.422 --> 01:02:06.468
TRAVIS: I faint.

01:02:06.468 --> 01:02:08.107
(laughter)

01:02:08.107 --> 01:02:11.517
LAURA: Hey, while he's out, should we get this
sword off him?

01:02:11.517 --> 01:02:12.977
LIAM: Why?

01:02:12.977 --> 01:02:19.402
LAURA: Because it seems like he's a little weird
from it. Nobody else feels that way?

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:21.131
TALIESIN: I think so.

01:02:21.131 --> 01:02:32.806
TRAVIS: (gasps) You're so strong. What'd I miss?

01:02:32.806 --> 01:02:34.346
LAURA: Nothing.

01:02:34.346 --> 01:02:39.624
MARISHA: We were talking about you. I mean, we
were talking about-- sorry, I'm still working on it.

01:02:39.624 --> 01:02:43.662
LAURA: Yeah, no, it's getting better. Should we
get off of the titan, maybe?

01:02:43.662 --> 01:02:45.206
SAM: It could fall.

01:02:45.206 --> 01:02:48.338
TALIESIN: Does anyone want to start walking
towards the city to see how bad it really is?

01:02:48.338 --> 01:02:52.241
LAURA: We'll have to get through the titan, or we
can fly down. Outside of that, I don't know.

01:02:52.241 --> 01:02:54.853
SAM: How many of us can fly? Well, I guess we
could take a couple of trips on the carpet.

01:02:54.853 --> 01:02:57.275
TALIESIN: We've got a carpet. Some of us have
wings.

01:02:57.275 --> 01:02:59.413
LIAM and MARISHA: My wings are gone.

01:02:59.413 --> 01:03:02.094
MATT: Yeah, your wings are gone. Pike's wings are
gone. You guys have your broom; you have the

01:03:02.094 --> 01:03:03.186
carpet.

01:03:03.186 --> 01:03:05.607
SAM: So we can take three trips on the carpet, or
something?

01:03:05.607 --> 01:03:08.230
TALIESIN: We can ride on the broom.

01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:10.984
MARISHA: Have we taken a short rest, at this
point?

01:03:10.984 --> 01:03:13.197
MATT: Yeah, you guys would have taken a short
rest, at this point.

01:03:13.197 --> 01:03:15.014
MARISHA: My beast shape's back.

01:03:15.014 --> 01:03:19.140
MATT: I'll say for the purposes of when you were
helping with the ritual that he was casting,

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:21.243
because that's an hour long, that would have been
a short rest, easy.

01:03:21.243 --> 01:03:23.576
LIAM: What are you going to be?

01:03:23.576 --> 01:03:29.713
MARISHA: Well, what do you want to fly in on? What
do you want?

01:03:29.713 --> 01:03:32.369
LIAM: Dragon?

01:03:32.369 --> 01:03:37.142
MARISHA: I can't do that. I can do anything in the
animal kingdom.

01:03:37.142 --> 01:03:40.830
TRAVIS: Before we go down, before we leave, what
about Sylas?

01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:43.939
LAURA: (gasps) Sylas.

01:03:43.939 --> 01:03:46.823
MARISHA: He flew away.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:50.593
LAURA: Right, but he's repairing somewhere.

01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:55.053
TRAVIS: They have coffins, right?

01:03:55.053 --> 01:04:00.447
LIAM: We deduced that it doesn't take him that
long to come back together. And it's been--

01:04:00.447 --> 01:04:01.901
MATT: Not &lt;i&gt;terribly&lt;/i&gt; long.

01:04:01.901 --> 01:04:05.904
LIAM: But we're right at that cutoff point.

01:04:05.904 --> 01:04:07.634
MATT: Maybe.

01:04:07.634 --> 01:04:12.344
TALIESIN: Try to scry on him! He's probably having
a bad day. There's enough time.

01:04:12.344 --> 01:04:14.031
MARISHA: I'll scry on him.

01:04:14.031 --> 01:04:16.465
TALIESIN: There's a gold dragon that should be--

01:04:16.465 --> 01:04:18.920
MARISHA: Oh, I haven't used any of my 5th-level
spells!

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:23.336
LAURA: Do you have Daylight, still? Something with
sun? I guess sunlight would take him out, because

01:04:23.336 --> 01:04:24.657
it's during the day.

01:04:24.657 --> 01:04:35.434
MARISHA: Yeah. I still have 3rd-level spells. Yep.
I also have my 6th-level spells. I have Sunbeam

01:04:35.434 --> 01:04:36.820
learned, which is dope.

01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:38.290
LIAM: That's all you need.

01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:40.334
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to scry on him.

01:04:40.334 --> 01:04:42.387
TALIESIN: Grog, do you want to trade boots, by the
way, again?

01:04:42.387 --> 01:04:44.344
MATT: Okay, and he's used all of his resistances.

01:04:44.344 --> 01:04:46.108
TALIESIN: We don't have to, if you really like
them.

01:04:46.108 --> 01:04:48.943
MARISHA: He's used all of his legendary
resistances? Is that what that was?

01:04:48.943 --> 01:04:56.094
MATT: Yeah. That is a natural 19 plus seven wisdom
save. So that's a 26.

01:04:56.094 --> 01:04:57.381
MARISHA: Oh my god!

01:04:57.381 --> 01:04:59.258
SAM: He beat your scry?

01:04:59.258 --> 01:05:01.069
MARISHA: He rolled a natural 19?

01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:02.367
MATT: Natural 19.

01:05:02.367 --> 01:05:03.483
LAURA: You can't do it?

01:05:03.483 --> 01:05:04.912
MARISHA: I can do it again. Can I do it again?

01:05:04.912 --> 01:05:06.093
MATT: If you have another spell slot for it.

01:05:06.093 --> 01:05:08.459
MARISHA: I do it again!

01:05:08.459 --> 01:05:12.176
MATT: Natural 16 plus seven. So that's a 23.

01:05:12.176 --> 01:05:14.514
SAM: That wins.

01:05:14.514 --> 01:05:20.583
LAURA: Can I try to cast Locate Object on the
pants he was wearing?

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:23.637
LIAM: That's amazing!

01:05:23.637 --> 01:05:27.227
LAURA: They're an object.

01:05:27.227 --> 01:05:29.091
TALIESIN: She &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; seen them.

01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:30.355
LAURA: I've seen them!

01:05:30.355 --> 01:05:31.878
TALIESIN: They're very nice.

01:05:31.878 --> 01:05:34.932
MATT: Let me consult the verbiage of--

01:05:34.932 --> 01:05:40.182
LIAM: This is amazing, and I love you. That is
amazing!

01:05:40.182 --> 01:05:45.325
TALIESIN: That is the greatest thing I've ever
heard. Locate Pants. I would like to scry upon the

01:05:45.325 --> 01:05:46.892
pants. The pantalones.

01:05:46.892 --> 01:05:48.750
LIAM: On his loafers.

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:56.681
MATT: Okay. All right, cool. And you have a
2nd-level spell slot for this?

01:05:56.681 --> 01:05:58.151
LAURA: Yes.

01:05:58.151 --> 01:06:06.536
MATT: So as you complete the spell and try to
focus as hard as you can on the pants of Lord

01:06:06.536 --> 01:06:07.962
Sylas Briarwood--

01:06:07.962 --> 01:06:09.751
TALIESIN: He has pajamas he changes into.

01:06:09.751 --> 01:06:11.428
LIAM: They're Batman pajamas.

01:06:11.428 --> 01:06:12.462
MATT: Nothing.

01:06:12.462 --> 01:06:18.497
LAURA: Nothing? He's definitely recovering naked.
Fuck! Nothing.

01:06:18.497 --> 01:06:19.498
MARISHA: No pants?

01:06:19.498 --> 01:06:20.567
LAURA: No pants.

01:06:20.567 --> 01:06:23.284
LIAM: He's in the buck!

01:06:23.284 --> 01:06:25.520
MARISHA: You guys! He's shirt-cocking somewhere!

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:29.514
(laughter)

01:06:29.514 --> 01:06:34.558
MATT: He prepared! He knew! "It's the only way
they won't find me!" He pulls his tearaways off

01:06:34.558 --> 01:06:36.956
and chucks them.

01:06:36.956 --> 01:06:39.547
TRAVIS: Just goes up and says hi to people.

01:06:39.547 --> 01:06:42.022
MARISHA: Flashing innocents through all the city!

01:06:42.022 --> 01:06:44.214
MATT: It's his dominate action.

01:06:44.214 --> 01:06:46.198
TRAVIS: Yeah, right!

01:06:46.198 --> 01:06:48.672
LAURA: We're going to have to worry about him at
some point.

01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:50.064
SAM: Not now.

01:06:50.064 --> 01:06:55.713
MARISHA: I can try and scrying eye him. I also
still have one more 5th-level spell.

01:06:55.713 --> 01:06:58.715
LAURA: Yeah, but how are we going to take him out
if you use all your spells to find him?

01:06:58.715 --> 01:07:00.398
MARISHA: I have a 6th.

01:07:00.398 --> 01:07:02.137
TRAVIS: Maybe we let him go.

01:07:02.137 --> 01:07:07.122
LIAM: She's saying you got one more shot, and we
still have some sunlight.

01:07:07.122 --> 01:07:08.834
LAURA and MARISHA: One more time.

01:07:08.834 --> 01:07:17.034
MATT: Well, you used the scrying eye before you
took the long rest in the Feywild, or was it

01:07:17.034 --> 01:07:17.950
after?

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:20.725
LIAM: That was for finding the Sword of Kas,
wasn't it, before we slept?

01:07:20.725 --> 01:07:23.149
MATT: Yeah, that would have been before. Yeah,
okay. So you can use it.

01:07:23.149 --> 01:07:24.779
MARISHA: But I'm using my 5th-level spell first.

01:07:24.779 --> 01:07:25.768
MATT: Okay, you are?

01:07:25.768 --> 01:07:26.948
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm using my 3rd.

01:07:26.948 --> 01:07:28.146
MATT: That's a natural seven.

01:07:28.146 --> 01:07:29.358
SAM: That could work.

01:07:29.358 --> 01:07:40.728
MATT: As you close your eyes and focus, trying
desperately to find the location of Sylas

01:07:40.728 --> 01:07:46.655
Briarwood, your vision pulls back and is thrust
past the titan, and there's a flash of movement.

01:07:46.655 --> 01:07:59.252
You're suddenly seeing trees. You're sensing
somewhere in the thick forest of the Vasper

01:07:59.252 --> 01:08:04.291
Timberlands. And there, you focus on rapidly
flapping bat wings.

01:08:04.291 --> 01:08:06.562
MARISHA: Still trying to get back? He's still
trying to get back!

01:08:06.562 --> 01:08:11.218
MATT: You don't know. He's in the forest
somewhere. He's in a deep forest with bits of snow

01:08:11.218 --> 01:08:15.373
around him. And you're only catching glimpses of
it as he goes through the shadowed underbrush.

01:08:15.373 --> 01:08:17.182
MARISHA: No type of landmark?

01:08:17.182 --> 01:08:20.139
MATT: Just trees, endless trees.

01:08:20.139 --> 01:08:22.305
LAURA: He's running away.

01:08:22.305 --> 01:08:24.708
TALIESIN: I would run if I were him.

01:08:24.708 --> 01:08:26.125
SAM: Deal with him another day.

01:08:26.125 --> 01:08:27.100
MARISHA: He's in the Vasper forest.

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:30.076
LIAM: Well, we'll never see him again.

01:08:30.076 --> 01:08:33.064
TALIESIN: He may finally have had enough.

01:08:33.064 --> 01:08:37.004
MARISHA: Do you ever think there's a chance for
Lady Briarwood to come back?

01:08:37.004 --> 01:08:39.170
LAURA: I don't think so.

01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:40.944
TRAVIS and LIAM: Never say never.

01:08:40.944 --> 01:08:42.523
TALIESIN: Never say never, but probably not.

01:08:42.523 --> 01:08:48.636
LAURA: I mean, if &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; can bring people back, they
might be able to.

01:08:48.636 --> 01:08:50.325
TRAVIS: That's a good point.

01:08:50.325 --> 01:08:54.483
TALIESIN: He would have to work &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; hard to
make it happen.

01:08:54.483 --> 01:08:57.691
TRAVIS: We're going to live a life of paranoia,
aren't we?

01:08:57.691 --> 01:09:00.158
TALIESIN: Well, we knew that going in.

01:09:00.158 --> 01:09:04.529
SAM: We'll be okay.

01:09:04.529 --> 01:09:08.483
LAURA: So do we go see the leaders here?

01:09:08.483 --> 01:09:10.210
SAM: Yeah. Let's go.

01:09:10.210 --> 01:09:11.754
TALIESIN: Let's go see who's left.

01:09:11.754 --> 01:09:13.700
MATT: All right.

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:14.869
SAM: To the platinum temple?

01:09:14.869 --> 01:09:21.509
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
around the corner, you see there's a few of the

01:09:21.509 --> 01:09:26.173
eagle riders that are getting on their eagle back
and flying off. There is one figure that stays

01:09:26.173 --> 01:09:31.896
behind and that turns around and begins to walk
your direction. In the chaos, you hadn't noticed

01:09:31.896 --> 01:09:40.233
that when Vecna had been dispelled, the force cage
that had maintained and locked in J'mon Sa Ord had

01:09:40.233 --> 01:09:47.656
vanished. You see them turn around and look
towards you in humanoid form. They approach with

01:09:47.656 --> 01:09:55.101
the long, jet-black hair, the darkened skin, the
beautiful coal-like ember eyes. Tall, almost as

01:09:55.101 --> 01:10:05.371
tall as Grog, though lithe in form and simply
clothed. J'mon approaches. "Well, I'm certainly

01:10:05.371 --> 01:10:13.932
"impressed. I apologize to have not been as much
help as I had hoped."

01:10:13.932 --> 01:10:16.605
LAURA: That was a shitty spell he cast.

01:10:16.605 --> 01:10:28.429
MATT: "It seems to be his forte. Nonetheless, the
least I can do is offer you a way into the city."

01:10:28.429 --> 01:10:32.879
TRAVIS: That would be lovely.

01:10:32.879 --> 01:10:40.872
MATT: "I would like to speak with the council that
remains, as well. Come with me." J'mon turns

01:10:40.872 --> 01:10:46.750
around and steps about 20 feet away before the
wings sprout out of their back and stretch to each

01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:53.948
side. You see the large brass dragon form expand,
the claws (impact) onto the ground. As they turn

01:10:53.948 --> 01:10:59.934
their head back over their shoulder, the deep
voice of the dragon form: "Hop on."

01:10:59.934 --> 01:11:08.727
LAURA: I'm going to hold on to Velora. And
Trinket, I swear it's going to be the last time,

01:11:08.727 --> 01:11:12.746
buddy. I'm not going to keep making you go in this
necklace much more.

01:11:12.746 --> 01:11:20.009
MATT: (bear grunts) Licks the side of your cheek.
And closes his eyes, waiting for it.

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:22.237
LAURA: Ooh, I love him so much.

01:11:22.237 --> 01:11:24.157
MATT: Into the necklace.

01:11:24.157 --> 01:11:30.116
LIAM: And as Vax and Keyleth get situated on
J'mon's back, I whisper in her ears: I was going

01:11:30.116 --> 01:11:32.962
to say eagle. Giant eagle.

01:11:32.962 --> 01:11:36.436
MARISHA: Yeah. That's good to know.

01:11:36.436 --> 01:11:41.640
TRAVIS: I pick up Pike and put her on my
shoulders. Get on the dragon.

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:49.709
MATT: Okay. Pike climbs up, now wingless. "Thank
you." Grabs onto the belt you have across your chest.

01:11:49.709 --> 01:11:50.935
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:11:50.935 --> 01:11:55.317
MATT: All right. So do you all climb up onto
J'mon's back?

01:11:55.317 --> 01:11:56.434
SAM: Absolutely.

01:11:56.434 --> 01:12:04.321
MATT: All right. J'mon, in Devo'ssa form, then
begins to run at a fast speed towards the edge of

01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:11.588
the city. Eventually, the wings begin to flap, and
with one giant thrust of wind, ascends. And once

01:12:11.588 --> 01:12:17.512
again, you feel the wind rocket through your hair,
as was your entry towards the titan. You begin to

01:12:17.512 --> 01:12:25.242
crest over the edge of Thar Amphala, over the
titan, and down towards the center of Vasselheim,

01:12:25.242 --> 01:12:35.295
the wind roaring past your face, your cloaks
whipping behind you. You have a bird's-eye view of

01:12:35.295 --> 01:12:44.707
the city that you've essentially saved. And
really, did so through a quick jaunt to the

01:12:44.707 --> 01:12:46.347
Feywild.

01:12:46.347 --> 01:12:58.767
The Braving Grounds still, while in severe
disarray and flames still burn, most everything's

01:12:58.767 --> 01:13:05.802
under control now. Whatever remains of the remnant
cultists, warriors, and undead have either been

01:13:05.802 --> 01:13:14.259
destroyed, captured, or run out of the city. As
you pick up 40, 50 feet over the rooftops, you see

01:13:14.259 --> 01:13:22.857
as hundreds of survivors have haphazardly armed
Bastions, as civilians of Vasselheim have picked

01:13:22.857 --> 01:13:28.715
up whatever arms were available, of soldiers in
the streets, children holding the hands of their

01:13:28.715 --> 01:13:34.601
families, all glance up and point at the majestic
brass dragon that coasts not more than maybe 40,

01:13:34.601 --> 01:13:40.674
50 feet ahead, signifying once more a symbol of
hope and victory. You hear the shouts behind you.

01:13:40.674 --> 01:13:46.658
As you begin to make your way around the Heaven's
Stair mountain and then up, gliding over the steps

01:13:46.658 --> 01:13:49.044
leading up towards the platinum sanctuary.

01:13:49.044 --> 01:13:59.900
As you begin to glide up, you can see the steps
are littered with broken bone, splatters of

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:06.228
blood, broken bodies and silvered armor, and
familiar black sludge, connoting the remains of

01:14:06.228 --> 01:14:13.090
slain gloomstalkers. The immediate ground conflict
is over here and has been for some time. The

01:14:13.090 --> 01:14:19.952
stillness is now occupied with clusters of wounded
riders and platinum warriors that now rest atop

01:14:19.952 --> 01:14:26.208
the apex of the stair and the sanctuary platform
itself before you approach the entryway in the

01:14:26.208 --> 01:14:36.284
pillars. As you ascend, floating up, Devo'ssa
lands right at the top of the stair as all the

01:14:36.284 --> 01:14:42.200
soldiers and medics who are in the process of handling
the wounded, gathering the dead, all stop and look

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:48.043
at the majestic brass dragon form as they lower
themselves to allow each of you to carefully step off.

01:14:48.043 --> 01:14:55.893
As you do, you watch as the chatter, the
conversation, the quiver of worry, the intensity

01:14:55.893 --> 01:15:02.412
of the recovery, comes to stillness as each of the
soldiers, even those who have seen better days,

01:15:02.412 --> 01:15:12.319
stand up with a look of acknowledgment, greeting
you as you arrive, and all give a respectful bow

01:15:12.319 --> 01:15:21.640
of the head or kneel to you as you approach and
pass by. In the stillness, you begin to walk

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:27.837
towards the opening of the sanctuary, the doors
open already, and glance over your shoulder to see

01:15:27.837 --> 01:15:33.125
that J'mon has retaken their human form and is now
walking at your side.

01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:41.130
Entering the sanctuary, you can see folks are
rushing around a bit, and they notice your

01:15:41.130 --> 01:15:44.911
arrival, as well, but are also trying to make sure
that everything is accounted for, and there's a

01:15:44.911 --> 01:15:50.007
bit of hustle and bustle. The old Scalebearer Yon,
who greeted you first to Vasselheim, approaches

01:15:50.007 --> 01:16:02.115
quickly. "Oh, goodness me! Hello? You're well.
You've looked better, but so have we. That's fine.

01:16:02.115 --> 01:16:11.372
"I have questions to ask. But perhaps it's best
that-- come with me." And darts back towards the

01:16:11.372 --> 01:16:15.679
central meeting chambers of the Platinum
Sanctuary. You can see the circle of pillars that

01:16:15.679 --> 01:16:19.416
surround the wide marbled floors of the center
chamber where all these council meetings have

01:16:19.416 --> 01:16:24.108
previously taken place. You can see battle has
taken place here. While most of the bodies or the

01:16:24.108 --> 01:16:29.707
wounded or dead have been removed at this point,
you can see there are elements of chipped and

01:16:29.707 --> 01:16:35.827
broken stone and marble. You can see scattered
remains and blood stains at points towards the

01:16:35.827 --> 01:16:39.897
entryway. But most of it appears to have been
halted at the entryway. All of the combat has

01:16:39.897 --> 01:16:48.016
halted within the sanctuary. Glancing past, you
can see most of the council you met last is not

01:16:48.016 --> 01:16:54.495
here. They're probably handling their various
portions of the city. But you do see amongst a

01:16:54.495 --> 01:17:02.224
number of inner guardians of the sanctuary
Highbearer Vord, who himself looks like he's seen

01:17:02.224 --> 01:17:11.903
a bit of a fray, and Allura Vysoren to his side.
Both harried, but alive. As soon as you begin to

01:17:11.903 --> 01:17:16.734
approach, their conversation comes to a halt. As
Allura turns and sees you all, her face brightens

01:17:16.734 --> 01:17:26.003
and she immediately rushes up, tossing any sort of
formalities to the side, and runs up. Before she

01:17:26.003 --> 01:17:29.386
can give you a hug, she sees the child in your
arms.

01:17:29.386 --> 01:17:32.474
LAURA: She's all right.

01:17:32.474 --> 01:17:35.021
MATT: "I'm so glad."

01:17:35.021 --> 01:17:37.371
MARISHA: Yeah, group hug!

01:17:37.371 --> 01:17:44.686
MATT: She pulls you in, and you all bundle into
this big group hug, heaving breaths of relief

01:17:44.686 --> 01:17:52.238
cascade through your grouping. You hear the throat
clear behind as Vord goes, (clears throat).

01:17:52.238 --> 01:17:54.175
TRAVIS: Decorum.

01:17:54.175 --> 01:17:57.922
LAURA: How's Kima?

01:17:57.922 --> 01:18:05.553
MATT: "I assume she's well. She's been doing what
she does best, which is wander the streets,

01:18:05.553 --> 01:18:13.448
"destroying things that she doesn't like. I've been
keeping a close eye from a distance as best I can.

01:18:13.448 --> 01:18:14.743
"She seems all right."

01:18:14.743 --> 01:18:16.682
TALIESIN: Any word from Gilmore in the last hour?

01:18:16.682 --> 01:18:19.097
MATT: "No, why?"

01:18:19.097 --> 01:18:24.304
MARISHA: He was in the tower. He was a decoy; we
almost slayed him.

01:18:24.304 --> 01:18:25.963
LAURA: He'd been taken.

01:18:25.963 --> 01:18:28.244
LIAM and TALIESIN: He's all right.

01:18:28.244 --> 01:18:32.119
SAM: Do we know where he teleported off to?

01:18:32.119 --> 01:18:34.835
MARISHA: We sent him off with Cassandra.

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:36.514
TALIESIN: Into the woods.

01:18:36.514 --> 01:18:39.631
LAURA: Into the wood.

01:18:39.631 --> 01:18:43.250
SAM: Don't worry, it's a big woods. It'll be
okay.

01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:47.525
LIAM: This city still stands. You have carried out
a miracle.

01:18:47.525 --> 01:18:59.267
MATT: "I've done nothing. Word seems to--" And at
that point, she gets cut off by Highbearer Vord,

01:18:59.267 --> 01:19:08.487
who steps forward, his arms crossed. "Word seems
to have spread, and I wish not to celebrate

01:19:08.487 --> 01:19:22.188
"prematurely. I have reports that you were there,
that you did battle with this ancient beast. What

01:19:22.188 --> 01:19:26.759
"is your assurance? What is your confidence that
this is indeed over, and we're not lulled into a

01:19:26.759 --> 01:19:28.711
"false sense of security?"

01:19:28.711 --> 01:19:38.133
TRAVIS: We're pretty sure he's alive and well. You
know, he's a threat right now. (whispering) What,

01:19:38.133 --> 01:19:39.498
do we have proof?

01:19:39.498 --> 01:19:40.879
LAURA: Oh, proof.

01:19:40.879 --> 01:19:43.437
TALIESIN: I've never known a true sense of
security. I'm not entirely sure.

01:19:43.437 --> 01:19:46.329
SAM: The proof is we're here and we're alive.

01:19:46.329 --> 01:19:48.404
LAURA: And that titan has stopped moving.

01:19:48.404 --> 01:20:00.016
LIAM: I am the champion of the Raven Queen. And
she has allowed me to track his every movement for

01:20:00.016 --> 01:20:01.206
a while now.

01:20:01.206 --> 01:20:03.613
MATT: "I recall you mentioning that when we last
met."

01:20:03.613 --> 01:20:05.606
LIAM: He's gone.

01:20:05.606 --> 01:20:08.210
TRAVIS: There was a process. We had trammels.

01:20:08.210 --> 01:20:10.982
LAURA: You remembered the word.

01:20:10.982 --> 01:20:12.284
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:20:12.284 --> 01:20:15.058
MARISHA: Do I still have the remains of the broken
trammel or did it shatter?

01:20:15.058 --> 01:20:20.017
MATT: No, that shit shattered. It turned to dust.

01:20:20.017 --> 01:20:24.205
LAURA: Yeah, glitter bomb. Oh, glitter-bomb Vecna!
I like the idea that he got glitter-bombed.

01:20:24.205 --> 01:20:30.741
MATT: "That was my good eye!"

01:20:30.741 --> 01:20:33.349
(laughter)

01:20:33.349 --> 01:20:38.877
MATT: All right. You see, as you guys are
discussing, the Highbearer's eyes lock to Vax's,

01:20:38.877 --> 01:20:46.024
and you see softness return to his face. The
tension, the unknowing, begins to subside with a

01:20:46.024 --> 01:21:02.494
smile, comes across his stilted, older elvish
visage. "You all. There was a time I did not look past your

01:21:02.494 --> 01:21:12.106
"beginnings. I am ashamed at my misjudgment." He
looks around as folks begin to gather. He

01:21:12.106 --> 01:21:23.065
acknowledges J'mon, who's approached. They've
bowed, carefully. "Many heroes rose to challenge

01:21:23.065 --> 01:21:35.268
"this day. Many we've lost. And many others that
remain to remember them. Let us vow to never

01:21:35.268 --> 01:21:47.679
"forget those who gave everything so that we could
still stand here to remember. You, Vox Machina,

01:21:47.679 --> 01:21:58.116
"stand as that beacon of hope upon which we all we
hold. You may not fully understand the scope of

01:21:58.116 --> 01:22:10.408
"what you have done but I assure you, we do. And we
will. We humble of Vasselheim are eternally in

01:22:10.408 --> 01:22:22.000
"your debt. As is much of the ignorant world,
perhaps. On behalf of Silver Talon's Reach, I

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.489
"thank you for everything."

01:22:25.489 --> 01:22:33.927
The rest of the room who's begun to gather now,
you see other soldiers that were waiting outside

01:22:33.927 --> 01:22:40.656
as you first approached have begun to filter in. And
as you glance back towards the entry hallway of

01:22:40.656 --> 01:22:47.615
the Platinum Sanctuary, you see faces. People that
greeted you in. People hearing these words

01:22:47.615 --> 01:22:51.526
resounding in silence, and they all begin to bow
low.

01:22:51.526 --> 01:22:55.342
LAURA: This is weird.

01:22:55.342 --> 01:22:58.060
SAM: Should we say something?

01:22:58.060 --> 01:22:59.521
TRAVIS: Ask for money?

01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:01.946
LAURA: They haven't done our fees, right?

01:23:01.946 --> 01:23:04.960
MARISHA: I'm supremely uncomfortable.

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:08.128
SAM: You are the leader of your people. Maybe you
should say something.

01:23:08.128 --> 01:23:09.126
MARISHA: What?

01:23:09.126 --> 01:23:10.377
SAM: You're a leader!

01:23:10.377 --> 01:23:12.614
MARISHA: No! But I'm not a leader of these
people.

01:23:12.614 --> 01:23:16.613
LAURA: You've been giving us really good
inspirational speeches. Get up and say something.

01:23:16.613 --> 01:23:19.912
TALIESIN: Get up and say something.

01:23:19.912 --> 01:23:21.787
LAURA: Say something really awesome.

01:23:21.787 --> 01:23:23.991
TALIESIN: Just tell people it was brilliant and
great.

01:23:23.991 --> 01:23:28.142
MARISHA: Okay. I step forward.

01:23:28.142 --> 01:23:38.261
MATT: So as you stand here amongst this procession
of warriors, people that now look up and don't see

01:23:38.261 --> 01:23:42.316
Keyleth the druid, they see the Voice of the
Tempest. They see one of the

01:23:42.316 --> 01:23:50.570
as-to-probably-be-remembered saviors of the city
and beyond. All eyes are on you as Highbearer Vord

01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:52.043
steps away.

01:23:52.043 --> 01:23:54.306
LIAM: I'm still holding your hand.

01:23:54.306 --> 01:24:15.013
MARISHA: (chuckles, sighs) The bravery of
Vasselheim remains evident on this day, and you

01:24:15.013 --> 01:24:28.449
all should be proud that your reputation of a city
unfallen by invasion or attack remains, and that

01:24:28.449 --> 01:24:40.775
is only because of the faith and the bravery and
the strength of the citizens of this amazing city.

01:24:40.775 --> 01:24:55.997
We of Vox Machina are proud and honored to have
fought by every single one of you, and we vow to

01:24:55.997 --> 01:25:06.678
continue to stand by your side through the rest of
our days. Huzzah!

01:25:06.678 --> 01:25:08.696
ALL: Huzzah!

01:25:08.696 --> 01:25:18.856
(cheering)

01:25:18.856 --> 01:25:20.665
ASHLEY: Hey, can you hear me?

01:25:20.665 --> 01:25:27.783
MATT: With a wave of cheers that roar from within
these marbled halls that echo, boom and

01:25:27.783 --> 01:25:29.054
reverberate--

01:25:29.054 --> 01:25:36.553
MARISHA: To 1,000 years of Vasselheim! Huzzah!

01:25:36.553 --> 01:25:42.464
MATT: Cheers and cries and fists raise and Pike's
cheering--

01:25:42.464 --> 01:25:44.865
ASHLEY: Yay!

01:25:44.865 --> 01:25:48.079
(laughter)

01:25:48.079 --> 01:25:57.431
MATT: You see Velora pull away from Allura's arm,
who's come by to help you carry her, and she:

01:25:57.431 --> 01:26:10.550
(weakly) "Yay." And Allura looks to you with an
absolute look of respect and pride. Even the

01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:16.831
Highbearer seems to be taken by the words. Shit,
everyone in the room gets temporary hit points,

01:26:16.831 --> 01:26:18.103
practically.

01:26:18.103 --> 01:26:23.810
MARISHA: Yeah! 20 hit points now.

01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:30.580
MATT: The sun-glass roof, which currently has been
sitting within the shadow of the mountain, the

01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:34.976
sunlight begins to peak past and glide
its way across the marble floor as everyone's

01:26:34.976 --> 01:26:40.770
cheering and the room now, which once was in
shadow of the mountain, is now lit up with

01:26:40.770 --> 01:26:46.978
sunlight. Now you can see the glittering armor
that peeks through the dirt, the grime, the blood,

01:26:46.978 --> 01:26:53.138
shining and sparkling on each of you, across
Pike's beautiful armor, across all the warriors

01:26:53.138 --> 01:26:59.540
that stand here, across the Scalebearer's design,
across your hair. The room is filled with light

01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:07.344
and though you sense the presence of probably
Bahamut, glancing down you can't help but think

01:27:07.344 --> 01:27:17.122
that this is also the approving glance of Pelor,
perhaps a bit of the Everlight. As the cheers

01:27:17.122 --> 01:27:24.704
begin to fade, the crowd begins to pull away.
Conversations progress, thank-yous are given,

01:27:24.704 --> 01:27:30.062
people come up to you. And eventually you guys
begin to step out of the Sanctuary and there you

01:27:30.062 --> 01:27:34.202
look down across the upper platform, looking down
over the city. You can see the Birthheart, the

01:27:34.202 --> 01:27:43.000
Duskmeadow, pillars of smoke rising up as the sun
now hangs high in the sky.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:52.492
A cold sensation takes you in the chest, Vax. A
small pain.

01:27:52.492 --> 01:28:06.776
A second one. And your eyes shoot over across to
the Raven's Crest, damaged but still standing. You

01:28:06.776 --> 01:28:13.699
turn around to look at the rest of your family and
as you guys look at his face, in but a flash you

01:28:13.699 --> 01:28:24.702
can see this dark shape behind him. This looming
black cloak, this lithe dress that cascades down

01:28:24.702 --> 01:28:32.224
into a bell and drags across the ground. And there
you see the form of the Raven Queen, porcelain

01:28:32.224 --> 01:28:41.130
mask, long dark hair behind, as her hands slowly
creep over the shoulders of Vax'ildan.

01:28:41.130 --> 01:28:46.224
TALIESIN: I walk to step in between.

01:28:46.224 --> 01:28:47.791
MATT: In between the two of them?

01:28:47.791 --> 01:28:49.096
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:28:49.096 --> 01:28:56.836
MATT: While the lips do not move on this mask, the
voice in your head says, "You've done well, but do

01:28:56.836 --> 01:28:59.552
"not approach. This is not for you."

01:28:59.552 --> 01:29:01.518
MARISHA: No.

01:29:01.518 --> 01:29:04.574
TALIESIN: Do you recall what you told me once?

01:29:04.574 --> 01:29:08.197
MATT: No response. Do you continue to walk?

01:29:08.197 --> 01:29:09.627
TALIESIN: I do.

01:29:09.627 --> 01:29:11.878
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

01:29:11.878 --> 01:29:13.737
LIAM: Percy.

01:29:13.737 --> 01:29:23.454
TALIESIN: No. No, that's-- actually, you know
what? Hey, that's right. I'm going to Resolve that.

01:29:23.454 --> 01:29:25.229
LIAM: Freddie.

01:29:25.229 --> 01:29:30.524
TALIESIN: This is not about you. That's a 19, 22.

01:29:30.524 --> 01:29:32.139
MATT: That does not do it.

01:29:32.139 --> 01:29:33.493
TALIESIN: Damn it. I have a 19.

01:29:33.493 --> 01:29:42.325
MATT: I know. Muscles lock into place and you find
yourself held there on your third step. The voice,

01:29:42.325 --> 01:29:52.924
which is omnipresent in your mind, all about,
continues. Soothing. Cold, distant but still

01:29:52.924 --> 01:30:04.284
soothing. The mask slowly looks down towards you.
"You have done well, my champion. The skein of

01:30:04.284 --> 01:30:12.273
"destiny has tugged in your wake, and even this
victory culminates with the crossing of a few

01:30:12.273 --> 01:30:24.167
"fate-touched souls. By your hand, your bravery,
your sacrifice, you ensure a future for all you

01:30:24.167 --> 01:30:34.976
"love and all who will come to love you and what
you've done. You may never know the import of your

01:30:34.976 --> 01:30:43.223
"time here, but take solace in the knowledge that
you will see the ripples of your actions carry

01:30:43.223 --> 01:30:58.575
"hope for generations to come. My Vax'ildan. It is
time. Say your goodbyes, then come join my side."

01:30:58.575 --> 01:31:04.612
And the hands pull away. She stands there.

01:31:04.612 --> 01:31:14.991
SAM: Now? We don't even get a night together or
anything?

01:31:14.991 --> 01:31:19.138
MARISHA: It's not fair.

01:31:19.138 --> 01:31:28.915
LAURA: We've got a really long time to be alive.
You've got an infinite time. What's a few more years?

01:31:28.915 --> 01:31:38.793
MARISHA: He sacrificed himself in your name; you
remain the only ascended. And yet he still loses?

01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:51.714
MATT: "He does not lose. The gifts I gave, indeed
all of your patrons gave, were so that you," and

01:31:51.714 --> 01:31:59.063
you watch as her hands extend almost impossibly
long around her, "and everyone here still stands.

01:31:59.063 --> 01:32:12.756
"I understand selfishness. I understand the impulse
of mortality. But I would hope that you understand

01:32:12.756 --> 01:32:26.595
"that the actions that you've allowed Vax'ildan in
this sacrifice are far larger. But we made a deal.

01:32:26.595 --> 01:32:29.868
"With power comes a price."

01:32:29.868 --> 01:32:41.143
MARISHA: I'm not ready.

01:32:41.143 --> 01:32:47.576
LIAM: You're ready for your people.

01:32:47.576 --> 01:32:50.978
MARISHA: Not without you.

01:32:50.978 --> 01:33:13.492
LIAM: I am so very proud of you, and so grateful
for everything you gave to me. You are going to be

01:33:13.492 --> 01:33:16.276
a strong leader and a wise leader.

01:33:16.276 --> 01:33:27.725
MARISHA: I'll find you. I promise. I'll see you
again.

01:33:27.725 --> 01:33:31.976
LIAM: I'll never be that far away.

01:33:31.976 --> 01:33:38.539
MARISHA: Forever.

01:33:38.539 --> 01:33:50.264
LIAM: And ever and always.

01:33:50.264 --> 01:34:09.328
Boys. My brothers... I love you.

01:34:09.328 --> 01:34:25.103
SAM: We love you, too. Thank you for everything.
If you want us to fight her, just say jenga, and

01:34:25.103 --> 01:34:27.169
we will.

01:34:27.169 --> 01:34:32.584
LIAM: Maybe from the other side. Someday, just for
shits and giggles.

01:34:32.584 --> 01:34:41.688
TRAVIS: Can I ask, are you afraid?

01:34:41.688 --> 01:35:00.452
LIAM: I'm going to go visit my mother, and I'll
see all of you again. Freddie.

01:35:00.452 --> 01:35:04.506
TALIESIN: I do not accept this.

01:35:04.506 --> 01:35:18.974
LIAM: I know. But I charge you to take good care
of my sister and love her. And your friend

01:35:18.974 --> 01:35:28.540
Keyleth, love her, as well. She will need it. She
will need friends.

01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:31.076
TALIESIN: Of course.

01:35:31.076 --> 01:35:39.475
LIAM: Thank you for trying.

01:35:39.475 --> 01:35:43.290
SAM: I wish I could have done more.

01:35:43.290 --> 01:36:05.632
LIAM: You did everything. Pickle? Pickle, you
showed me the way. I know it doesn't look like

01:36:05.632 --> 01:36:09.441
that right now, but you absolutely did.

01:36:09.441 --> 01:36:15.183
ASHLEY: I wish I could restore you.

01:36:15.183 --> 01:36:29.359
LIAM: (chuckles) You taught me purpose, Pickle.
Purpose. And I know I will see you again.

01:36:29.359 --> 01:36:37.806
ASHLEY: Isn't there--

01:36:37.806 --> 01:36:43.233
SAM: She said is there something we can do? It's
hard to hear her.

01:36:43.233 --> 01:37:01.890
LIAM: Be there for them. You be there for them.
You're the light in all our lives.

01:37:01.890 --> 01:37:04.249
LAURA: No.

01:37:04.249 --> 01:37:13.785
LIAM: I never had a greater friend than you. And
we traveled a lot, I never had a greater friend

01:37:13.785 --> 01:37:19.289
than you.

01:37:19.289 --> 01:37:26.505
LAURA: I feel like she's taking part of me away.

01:37:26.505 --> 01:37:34.826
LIAM: I will bring it with me to remind me of
you.

01:37:34.826 --> 01:37:38.975
LAURA: I don't know how to live.

01:37:38.975 --> 01:37:47.849
LIAM: I will see you again.

01:37:47.849 --> 01:37:49.202
LAURA: I know.

01:37:49.202 --> 01:37:59.545
LIAM: I will see you again. And I will tell your
mother that you say hello.

01:37:59.545 --> 01:38:10.277
LAURA: Please. 
I love you. I don't accept this.

01:38:10.277 --> 01:38:35.388
LIAM: I know that it's hard. And I am sorry.

01:38:35.388 --> 01:38:52.345
LAURA: I'm going to find you.

01:38:52.345 --> 01:39:01.790
LIAM: I take Keyleth's face in my hands and
happily take one more kiss. I'm sorry it's so cold.

01:39:01.790 --> 01:39:17.921
MARISHA: I don't care. I don't accept this. I love
you.

01:39:17.921 --> 01:39:31.146
LIAM: I will never stop loving you.

01:39:31.146 --> 01:39:33.663
MARISHA: This isn't fair.

01:39:33.663 --> 01:39:36.078
LIAM: I know.

01:39:36.078 --> 01:39:44.911
MARISHA: I guess we have to say goodbye.

01:39:44.911 --> 01:40:01.120
LIAM: For now. I love you, Keyleth of the Air
Ashari.

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:12.018
MARISHA: I love you, Vax'ildan. I'll see you
again.

01:40:12.018 --> 01:40:33.974
LIAM: I look to the Raven Queen and as I walk
closer, since I leveled up, I use the druid

01:40:33.974 --> 01:40:48.302
cantrip Druidcraft and grow snowdrops out from
where I stand, out to all of my family. Out to

01:40:48.302 --> 01:41:02.062
where they stand. S.H.I.T.s, thank you.

01:41:02.062 --> 01:41:35.300
How lucky I have been to have had all of you. 
How lucky, indeed. Thank you.

01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:47.827
MATT: And he turns and walks towards the darkened
cloak of his matron. In the darkness of her cloak,

01:41:47.827 --> 01:42:02.189
you see a brief light, and it's brighter for you.
As you walk forward, you see reaching from the

01:42:02.189 --> 01:42:13.132
light the dark hair, the fair skin, and the wide
smile of your mother, Elaina. As she greets you,

01:42:13.132 --> 01:42:18.701
she says, "I'm so proud."

01:42:18.701 --> 01:42:23.638
The rest of you watch as her cloak begins to fade
like a slowly scattered shadow in creeping

01:42:23.638 --> 01:42:31.828
sunlight. And as the snowdrop flowers continue
with each step, you blink,

01:42:31.828 --> 01:42:45.952
and it's just feathers.

01:42:45.952 --> 01:42:54.357
We're going to take a break, we'll be back here in
a few minutes, guys. (heavy exhale) Still more of

01:42:54.357 --> 01:43:03.050
this story to tell. See you guys in a bit.

01:43:03.050 --> 02:10:08.068
[break]

02:10:08.068 --> 02:10:12.299
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. So before
we jump back in, our winner in the chat of the

02:10:12.299 --> 02:10:18.661
giveaway is Mister Milgram. Congratulations.
Danoba will reach out to you and get your contact

02:10:18.661 --> 02:10:26.046
information and get your prize sent off to you, so
well done. All right, so. Bringing us back in.

02:10:26.046 --> 02:10:28.799
TALIESIN: No.

02:10:28.799 --> 02:10:32.133
SAM: Something feels different about the table.

02:10:32.133 --> 02:10:39.908
MATT: Yeah. As the cold wind subsides and the
feathers glide through the wind off the edge of

02:10:39.908 --> 02:10:53.796
the Silver Talon's Reach, pinnacle of Platinum
Sanctuary, you gather your thoughts. Quiet creeps

02:10:53.796 --> 02:10:59.528
over.

02:10:59.528 --> 02:11:06.919
SAM: I feel like I could have taken her if I had a
gun. I'm just saying.

02:11:06.919 --> 02:11:10.221
MARISHA: Scanlan, have we ever told you you're an
asshole?

02:11:10.221 --> 02:11:12.050
SAM: All the time.

02:11:12.050 --> 02:11:14.629
TALIESIN: I use Manners on Scanlan.

02:11:14.629 --> 02:11:19.310
MATT: All right. What's the save on that?

02:11:19.310 --> 02:11:25.922
TALIESIN: Wow. Where is it?

02:11:25.922 --> 02:11:28.223
MARISHA: You got to sort through all your coffee
stains.

02:11:28.223 --> 02:11:30.546
TALIESIN: These are my coffee stains.

02:11:30.546 --> 02:11:32.366
MARISHA: He's really irritable.

02:11:32.366 --> 02:11:35.680
SAM: Jesus, you have so many things.

02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:38.640
TALIESIN: Yes, I do. It's a--

02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:44.398
LAURA: I hug Trinket.

02:11:44.398 --> 02:11:46.703
TALIESIN: Ranged attack roll with an attack bonus
equal to my dex modifier plus my proficiency

02:11:46.703 --> 02:11:48.029
bonus.

02:11:48.029 --> 02:11:52.322
MARISHA: Keyleth sits next to Vex and lays her
head on her shoulder.

02:11:52.322 --> 02:11:53.015
SAM: Against AC?

02:11:53.015 --> 02:11:54.103
TALIESIN: Against you.

02:11:54.103 --> 02:11:56.162
SAM: Oh. (laughs) I'm out.

02:11:56.162 --> 02:12:03.998
TALIESIN: Yeah. That's a six, 12, 24, I think.

02:12:03.998 --> 02:12:06.700
MATT: Okay and what's the-- or it just hits and he
has to make--

02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:09.841
TALIESIN: It just hits. You can make a strength
check against 20.

02:12:09.841 --> 02:12:15.300
MATT: To try and break out of it as an action,
right? So as you finish your statement, Percival

02:12:15.300 --> 02:12:25.123
throws an orb at you and it expands, locks you up
into this cage of metal bars and claws and chains,

02:12:25.123 --> 02:12:27.227
and you're locked in place, unable to move.

02:12:27.227 --> 02:12:28.478
SAM: Feels right.

02:12:28.478 --> 02:12:30.376
TRAVIS: Was that necessary?

02:12:30.376 --> 02:12:32.527
TALIESIN: I'll let him out when I'm feeling like
it.

02:12:32.527 --> 02:12:34.375
TRAVIS: Makes sense.

02:12:34.375 --> 02:12:39.172
MARISHA: I don't have the strength to argue with
him.

02:12:39.172 --> 02:12:42.407
LAURA: Sorry, Scanlan.

02:12:42.407 --> 02:12:45.605
SAM: (muffled) It's okay. I'm okay in here.

02:12:45.605 --> 02:12:48.036
TALIESIN: Actually, I'll unlock it so he can say
that.

02:12:48.036 --> 02:12:55.779
SAM: Oh, hi. That was a very touching ceremony.
Well, I'll just be in here, crying.

02:12:55.779 --> 02:12:57.885
MARISHA: Aw.

02:12:57.885 --> 02:13:04.879
LAURA: Percy, please let him out, I can't take it
right now.

02:13:04.879 --> 02:13:09.061
TALIESIN: I very quickly go through Scanlan's
pockets to make sure there's nothing else that I

02:13:09.061 --> 02:13:10.834
need to take back from him.

02:13:10.834 --> 02:13:12.213
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:13:12.213 --> 02:13:18.720
TALIESIN: Thank you. Nope. I let him out.
Manners.

02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:23.745
MARISHA: That might be the last natural one of
this campaign. You have to scream it from a

02:13:23.745 --> 02:13:25.443
mountaintop, man.

02:13:25.443 --> 02:13:27.797
SAM: The golden snitch!

02:13:27.797 --> 02:13:29.977
LAURA: How could you do that?

02:13:29.977 --> 02:13:31.382
MARISHA: Betrayal.

02:13:31.382 --> 02:13:33.593
MATT: It's mine now.

02:13:33.593 --> 02:13:36.378
(laughter)

02:13:36.378 --> 02:13:38.380
TRAVIS: A celestial hand reaches out of the
clouds.

02:13:38.380 --> 02:13:40.185
MATT: Hello, next campaign.

02:13:40.185 --> 02:13:41.526
LAURA: Oh shit.

02:13:41.526 --> 02:13:43.010
MARISHA: One man's trash.

02:13:43.010 --> 02:13:46.696
LAURA: Keyleth, dear.

02:13:46.696 --> 02:13:48.575
MARISHA: Yes?

02:13:48.575 --> 02:13:58.651
LAURA: I know it was never made official, but I'm
assuming you two would've spent your life

02:13:58.651 --> 02:14:04.108
together. As much of it as he had, anyway.

02:14:04.108 --> 02:14:13.441
MARISHA: He taught me how to love and I have a
hard time with interpersonal relationships.

02:14:13.441 --> 02:14:15.854
LAURA: I would've never known.

02:14:15.854 --> 02:14:22.795
MARISHA: So I would've held onto that one for as
long as I could've. And I still will.

02:14:22.795 --> 02:14:28.352
LAURA: I still count you as my sister.

02:14:28.352 --> 02:14:36.201
MARISHA: As I count you as mine. Going to have to
look out for each other now.

02:14:36.201 --> 02:14:40.635
LAURA: Yes.

02:14:40.635 --> 02:14:43.429
TALIESIN: I'm going to quietly wander outside.

02:14:43.429 --> 02:14:47.511
MATT: You're on the platform outside.

02:14:47.511 --> 02:14:50.385
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to break off for a
second.

02:14:50.385 --> 02:14:52.041
MARISHA: Also, fuck that raven bitch.

02:14:52.041 --> 02:14:53.088
LAURA: She's terrible.

02:14:53.088 --> 02:14:54.188
MARISHA: What the fuck?

02:14:54.188 --> 02:14:58.934
LAURA: You know we have a temple to her in
Whitestone. I mean, here's the thing though. I

02:14:58.934 --> 02:15:03.472
feel like I want to destroy it because I hate her
so much, but at the same time, I feel like we

02:15:03.472 --> 02:15:07.731
should leave it because maybe we can talk to him
through it. We'll try it.

02:15:07.731 --> 02:15:12.512
TRAVIS: Pike.

02:15:12.512 --> 02:15:14.966
ASHLEY: Yeah?

02:15:14.966 --> 02:15:32.532
TRAVIS: While we're here, I feel like if Bahamut
is the natural enemy of Tiamat, I don't know if I

02:15:32.532 --> 02:15:55.427
want to be bound to this sword for much longer. I
feel like my time of hunting Vecna is done. I feel like

02:15:55.427 --> 02:16:11.636
we have Arkhan's hand. Maybe if we handed it over
to the Platinum-- these people?

02:16:11.636 --> 02:16:14.906
ASHLEY: Okay. Yeah.

02:16:14.906 --> 02:16:18.092
TRAVIS: Then somebody else could take up that
hunt, right?

02:16:18.092 --> 02:16:28.061
ASHLEY: If that's what you want, Grog. I don't
think that's a bad idea.

02:16:28.061 --> 02:16:43.435
TRAVIS: Yeah. Okay. I think I want to turn over
this sword, but would you stay with me?

02:16:43.435 --> 02:16:45.770
ASHLEY: Of course I will.

02:16:45.770 --> 02:17:04.940
TRAVIS: He's very persuasive. Actually, Scanlan, 
will you come with me also?

02:17:04.940 --> 02:17:07.189
SAM: Absolutely.

02:17:07.189 --> 02:17:13.399
TRAVIS: All right. Can I make my way back towards
somebody official-looking?

02:17:13.399 --> 02:17:22.985
MATT: That would be either Highbearer Vord or
the one you met earlier.

02:17:22.985 --> 02:17:25.620
TRAVIS: Highbearer Orb sounds good.

02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:33.237
MATT: As you step back into the Platinum
Sanctuary, the voice creeps in your head. "I know

02:17:33.237 --> 02:17:40.560
"not what you're thinking, but know: together we are
more powerful than anyone who's wielded me. We

02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:46.450
"could take him down. We could destroy it all. You
cannot, you will not discard me."

02:17:46.450 --> 02:17:50.436
TRAVIS: Anyone ever? Stronger than anyone that's ever
wielded you?

02:17:50.436 --> 02:17:56.835
MATT: "Anyone who's ever wielded me. Together, we
could bring down anything that bears his title.

02:17:56.835 --> 02:17:59.964
"Anyone who pursues his power."

02:17:59.964 --> 02:18:02.610
ASHLEY: Grog?

02:18:02.610 --> 02:18:04.054
TRAVIS: Yeah?

02:18:04.054 --> 02:18:05.820
ASHLEY: What's he saying?

02:18:05.820 --> 02:18:13.690
TRAVIS: (sighs) You make a really good point.
We're really strong together and unstoppable.

02:18:13.690 --> 02:18:19.001
MATT: You feel this (pulse) in your brain, there's
a flash vision of the hand, once held in your

02:18:19.001 --> 02:18:24.118
grasp, swollen atop the actual body of
Vecna in the battle. Your vision comes back and

02:18:24.156 --> 02:18:26.844
that urge in your belly creeps up.

02:18:26.844 --> 02:18:33.070
TRAVIS: I mean, hold on, Pike. Maybe we could do a
lot of good. We could really rid the world of a

02:18:33.070 --> 02:18:35.705
lot of bad stuff.

02:18:35.705 --> 02:18:47.093
ASHLEY: Listen, we did that before you knew this
sword. We're all strong together. You were strong

02:18:47.093 --> 02:18:49.332
before it and you'll be strong after it.

02:18:49.332 --> 02:18:59.891
TRAVIS: (exhales) Okay. (strained) Highbearer Orb,
a moment, please.

02:18:59.891 --> 02:19:08.223
MATT: As you enter the chamber once more, the
Highbearer turns around. "Yes, Grog Strongjaw,

02:19:08.223 --> 02:19:10.016
"what do you require?"

02:19:10.016 --> 02:19:15.111
TRAVIS: I would like to make a deposit.

02:19:15.111 --> 02:19:18.922
MATT: "Go on."

02:19:18.922 --> 02:19:28.019
TRAVIS: I have on my person the Sword--

02:19:28.019 --> 02:19:30.267
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

02:19:30.267 --> 02:19:35.319
TRAVIS: Okay. 14.

02:19:35.319 --> 02:19:41.156
MATT: The words don't escape your mouth and you
realize this was a bad idea.

02:19:41.156 --> 02:19:59.994
TRAVIS: (sighs) I'm so sorry to waste your time. I
wanted to thank you for hosting us. Bidet. And I

02:19:59.994 --> 02:20:02.220
start to turn and walk out.

02:20:02.220 --> 02:20:05.901
ASHLEY: I grab him by the hand. So he can't go
anywhere.

02:20:05.901 --> 02:20:07.988
SAM: Are you not doing this, Grog?

02:20:07.988 --> 02:20:11.334
TRAVIS: It's a bad idea.

02:20:11.334 --> 02:20:18.847
MATT: "We could do so much together. We can destroy
anyone who's ever thought to pray to the now

02:20:18.847 --> 02:20:22.994
"Undying King sealed away. We could wipe his
presence from this planet!"

02:20:22.994 --> 02:20:27.044
TRAVIS: (strained) Together we could do so much,
we could dry eraser-board the planet.

02:20:27.044 --> 02:20:33.206
SAM: Whatever your wishes are, Grog. I'll go along
with it. If you wish to keep the sword, that's

02:20:33.268 --> 02:20:34.484
fine with me.

02:20:34.484 --> 02:20:35.970
TRAVIS: I want to keep it.

02:20:35.970 --> 02:20:36.971
SAM: Great.

02:20:36.971 --> 02:20:39.110
ASHLEY: Scanlan, I don't think this is a good
idea.

02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:42.788
SAM: Okay. Sell me on this.

02:20:42.788 --> 02:20:47.860
ASHLEY: Look at him!

02:20:47.860 --> 02:20:53.496
SAM: He's just flexing his face muscles.

02:20:53.496 --> 02:20:55.601
ASHLEY: He's getting all weird.

02:20:55.601 --> 02:20:57.351
TRAVIS: (strained) I want to keep it!

02:20:57.351 --> 02:21:00.852
SAM: No, he does this when he needs to go poo.
I've seen him do it.

02:21:00.852 --> 02:21:05.257
ASHLEY: I know. He definitely does this when he
needs to go poo. But this is so much worse!

02:21:05.257 --> 02:21:11.320
SAM: I mean, it's been a hard day. I think we all
need a really good bowel movement.

02:21:11.320 --> 02:21:13.763
TRAVIS: I start walking out of the Sanctuary.

02:21:13.763 --> 02:21:15.049
MATT: Pike, make a strength check.

02:21:15.049 --> 02:21:16.559
ASHLEY: No. Yes.

02:21:16.559 --> 02:21:22.494
MATT: So roll and add your strength modifier,
which I think is four.

02:21:22.494 --> 02:21:23.937
ASHLEY: It's five.

02:21:23.937 --> 02:21:25.584
MATT: Oh, it's five.

02:21:25.584 --> 02:21:27.043
LAURA: She's got the gauntlets on.

02:21:27.043 --> 02:21:30.684
MATT: Gauntlets bring it to 19, so it'll be a plus
four, I'm pretty sure.

02:21:30.684 --> 02:21:32.933
ASHLEY: Wait, I think I had a plus one somewhere.

02:21:32.933 --> 02:21:35.266
SAM: Did you get some boon or boost or something?

02:21:35.266 --> 02:21:39.039
ASHLEY: With a plus four, it's 17.

02:21:39.039 --> 02:21:41.108
MATT: 17. Grog, roll a strength check.

02:21:41.108 --> 02:21:43.361
LAURA: Roll a one! Roll a one!

02:21:43.361 --> 02:21:45.250
TRAVIS: 19.

02:21:45.250 --> 02:21:50.858
MATT: 19. Pike, your feet begin to scrape against
the marble as Grog's form and strength, which is

02:21:50.858 --> 02:21:54.467
just a little bit more than you. He's a little
more monster than your monster right now.

02:21:54.467 --> 02:21:57.292
ASHLEY: Can I swing my other hand up and try to
pull more?

02:21:57.292 --> 02:21:59.998
MATT: I'll allow you one more strength check with
disadvantage.

02:21:59.998 --> 02:22:02.118
SAM: Really conflicted here.

02:22:02.118 --> 02:22:09.432
TRAVIS: (strained) I want to help the planet.

02:22:09.432 --> 02:22:11.802
SAM: He seems totally normal to me.

02:22:11.802 --> 02:22:13.171
ASHLEY: 14.

02:22:13.171 --> 02:22:15.067
MATT: Grog, roll another strength check.

02:22:15.067 --> 02:22:19.724
TRAVIS: 15.

02:22:19.724 --> 02:22:26.044
MATT: Still, your metal boots are scraping across
the marble as you're pulling and trying to hold

02:22:26.044 --> 02:22:31.766
him back as he's walking out the room. The voice
says, "Yes. Together, the two of us."

02:22:31.766 --> 02:22:42.298
TRAVIS: (strained) Just the two of us. We can make
it if we try! Just the two of us, Kas and I.

02:22:42.298 --> 02:22:46.444
MATT: Highbearer Vord says, "Is everything all
right?"

02:22:46.444 --> 02:22:50.013
SAM: Pike, do you want me to try to stop him?
What's going on?

02:22:50.013 --> 02:22:57.703
ASHLEY: I think this is not a good idea. Grog,
this is something you wanted to do. You need to

02:22:57.703 --> 02:22:59.294
fight it.

02:22:59.294 --> 02:23:01.908
TRAVIS: Can I try and fight it?

02:23:01.908 --> 02:23:08.423
MATT: You already lost at the moment. So yeah,
he's currently locked into that mindset.

02:23:08.423 --> 02:23:12.385
SAM: Pike, should I do something or no?

02:23:12.385 --> 02:23:18.253
ASHLEY: Well, I think we could both do something,
but I want Grog to fight this.

02:23:18.253 --> 02:23:31.254
SAM: Why don't I help him fight it? I will cast
Suggestion on Grog, using my last level two spell.

02:23:31.254 --> 02:23:47.274
And suggest that he think long and hard about
maybe fighting back against this sword. One more time.

02:23:47.274 --> 02:23:49.640
ASHLEY: Then if it doesn't work, I have an idea.

02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:55.735
MATT: All right. So bringing up Suggestion here,
make a wisdom saving throw, Grog.

02:23:55.735 --> 02:24:01.716
TRAVIS: 11.

02:24:01.716 --> 02:24:10.084
MATT: 11. Okay. As the suggestion creeps through
your mind, the familiar voice of Scanlan through

02:24:10.084 --> 02:24:17.197
your ears gives you just enough moment of pause to
allow you an additional saving throw against the

02:24:17.197 --> 02:24:19.497
influence.

02:24:19.497 --> 02:24:26.186
TRAVIS: Maybe I'll take mine-- is it a wisdom
saving throw?

02:24:26.186 --> 02:24:27.458
MATT: Yes, it is.

02:24:27.458 --> 02:24:29.426
TRAVIS: That's a five.

02:24:29.426 --> 02:24:31.154
TALIESIN: My god, we're saved.

02:24:31.154 --> 02:24:35.093
MATT: The suggestion does not seem to take hold
and he's now dragged Pike almost back to the

02:24:35.093 --> 02:24:39.984
entryway of the Platinum Sanctuary and the
Highbearer is still looking a bit confused.

02:24:39.984 --> 02:24:42.995
SAM: He's made his choice.

02:24:42.995 --> 02:24:51.458
ASHLEY: No! Grog. Stop just one moment.

02:24:51.458 --> 02:24:53.700
TRAVIS: Okay. I stop.

02:24:53.700 --> 02:25:05.765
ASHLEY: And I look him in the eyes, I cast Greater
Restoration. Still have another slot left, will

02:25:05.765 --> 02:25:07.317
that work?

02:25:07.317 --> 02:25:12.782
MATT: I would like you to go ahead and make a
wisdom check. This is contested against the wisdom

02:25:12.782 --> 02:25:14.254
of the sword.

02:25:14.254 --> 02:25:18.900
ASHLEY: I'm casting it at 7th-level because that's
all I have left.

02:25:18.900 --> 02:25:24.057
MATT: You know what, it's not going to have much
of an effect on this really, unfortunately. But

02:25:24.057 --> 02:25:26.926
the spell's cast. So roll a d20 and add your
wisdom modifier.

02:25:26.926 --> 02:25:33.864
MARISHA: You're smarter than a sword!

02:25:33.864 --> 02:25:39.189
ASHLEY: Do I get an advantage?

02:25:39.189 --> 02:25:46.086
MATT: Unfortunately, no in the circumstance. Just
roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier, which I

02:25:46.086 --> 02:25:47.428
believe is a five?

02:25:47.428 --> 02:25:53.790
ASHLEY: I have. Yeah, it's five. So nine.

02:25:53.790 --> 02:25:57.052
MARISHA and SAM: Oh!

02:25:57.052 --> 02:26:03.725
MATT: Well, (laughs).

02:26:03.790 --> 02:26:05.180
ASHLEY: You die.

02:26:05.180 --> 02:26:08.530
MATT: Yeah, you actually die. No.
That's not worth it. It's fine.

02:26:08.530 --> 02:26:10.120
SAM: Vax comes back and kills you.

02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:17.835
MATT: Yeah. I rolled a seven and he has a wisdom
modifier of plus one.

02:26:17.835 --> 02:26:19.594
LAURA: Oh shit!

02:26:19.594 --> 02:26:22.357
MARISHA: Oh my god, you did it!

02:26:22.357 --> 02:26:28.331
MATT: Like I legitimately-- that's pretty stupid.

02:26:28.331 --> 02:26:30.371
TALIESIN: Did you use my die?

02:26:30.371 --> 02:26:40.471
MATT: No, I did not use your die. I used my purple
one. I'm saving yours for the next campaign. So as

02:26:40.471 --> 02:26:47.167
the strength of wills between the cleric and the
sword begin to combat, the warmth of Pike's

02:26:47.167 --> 02:26:52.941
friendship and the force of Sarenrae's guidance
washes through your body and the cold steel of the

02:26:52.941 --> 02:26:58.320
sword begins to warm to the touch. And for a brief
minute, it gets so warm it's hot. It burns your

02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:03.296
fingertips and you instinctively throw the blade
to the ground. It clatters and slides about 15

02:27:03.296 --> 02:27:08.821
feet from you, spiralling and sparking across the
marble floor. The Highbearer's foot catches it in

02:27:08.821 --> 02:27:14.955
place. He leans forward. "Now I'm certainly
curious."

02:27:14.955 --> 02:27:22.198
TRAVIS: (deep breath) It is the Sword of Kas.

02:27:22.198 --> 02:27:26.561
MATT: You watch as the color begins to somewhat
return to Grog's face, his eyes returning to their

02:27:26.561 --> 02:27:33.689
natural pigment. The sallow, sunken features of
his body begin to fill out once more, the

02:27:33.689 --> 02:27:37.127
influence of the blade having left his psyche and
physicality.

02:27:37.127 --> 02:27:42.680
ASHLEY: Oh. You're back to light gray again. You
look great.

02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:49.603
TRAVIS: I'm feeling so achy. What happened?
Whew!

02:27:49.603 --> 02:27:55.544
ASHLEY: You made a decision and I felt it was the
right thing to do.

02:27:55.544 --> 02:27:57.644
TRAVIS: Yeah. We kept the sword, right?

02:27:57.644 --> 02:27:59.636
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's there.

02:27:59.636 --> 02:28:02.915
SAM: They're holding it for you.

02:28:02.915 --> 02:28:07.883
TRAVIS: Oh. Okay.

02:28:07.883 --> 02:28:13.471
MATT: At this point, you can see two of the other
Scalebearer guardians have flanked the sides of

02:28:13.471 --> 02:28:18.441
the Highbearer. As he removes his foot from the
blade and steps back, they both carefully lift it

02:28:18.441 --> 02:28:26.162
with a gauntlet and present it before him and he
glances down. "So you say this blade aided you?"

02:28:26.162 --> 02:28:35.959
TRAVIS: Yes. That blade, careful with it, very
powerful. He is bent on the destruction of one thing

02:28:35.959 --> 02:28:42.085
and one thing only. Vecna.

02:28:42.085 --> 02:28:51.252
MATT: "Good to know. We'll keep this within our
vaults in case the day or time arises."

02:28:51.252 --> 02:28:55.199
TRAVIS: Wait! I have something else. Then I show
the hand of Arkhan.

02:28:55.199 --> 02:29:02.240
MATT: "Yes?" It flops limply in your grasp.

02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:11.885
TRAVIS: Oh! The person that owned this hand--
okay, stay with me. Chopped this off and took

02:29:11.885 --> 02:29:18.151
Vecna's hand and stuck it on and then this got
left over. So this is not his hand anymore and the

02:29:18.151 --> 02:29:28.456
one that he does have is Vecna's. So if you use
your noodle, you can use this to trace him.

02:29:28.456 --> 02:29:37.549
MATT: "There are limitations to the use of such
objects. It may be of some aid to us, but the

02:29:37.549 --> 02:29:43.664
"knowledge of this individual is far more
important. However, we will accept this thing."

02:29:43.664 --> 02:29:47.892
And he ushers his hand forward and another servant
comes forward and retrieves the hand from you and

02:29:47.892 --> 02:29:53.388
folds the fingers up and places it within a small
pillow. Backs away.

02:29:53.388 --> 02:29:55.598
ASHLEY: I think that was a great idea.

02:29:55.598 --> 02:29:57.037
TRAVIS: Yeah, right? It was pretty smart.

02:29:57.037 --> 02:29:58.526
ASHLEY: Yes, it was very smart.

02:29:58.526 --> 02:30:03.828
MATT: "What was the name of this? This current
wielder of the Hand of Vecna."

02:30:03.828 --> 02:30:06.889
TRAVIS: Arkin. Arkeen?

02:30:06.889 --> 02:30:08.139
SAM: Arkhan.

02:30:08.139 --> 02:30:14.975
TRAVIS: Arkhan. Arkhan the Fool. The Cruel. The--

02:30:14.975 --> 02:30:16.782
SAM: Misguided.

02:30:16.782 --> 02:30:19.776
MATT: "Arkhan the Misguided?"

02:30:19.776 --> 02:30:26.300
TRAVIS: Don't underestimate him. He's really buff
and devious.

02:30:26.300 --> 02:30:32.276
SAM: And he's got another hand that he could chop
off too. One in reserve.

02:30:32.276 --> 02:30:42.661
MATT: "Very well. So we'll begin to do research
and seek out this Arkhan the Cruel?"

02:30:42.661 --> 02:30:47.353
TRAVIS: Cool. Yeah, he was pretty cool. He was
pretty cool.

02:30:47.353 --> 02:30:50.823
SAM: I was fighting a god. I didn't really catch
his name.

02:30:50.823 --> 02:30:57.255
TRAVIS: Well see, don't hurt him. He actually
helped us defeat Vecna. He pulled a tricksy-doodle

02:30:57.255 --> 02:30:58.992
and took the hand.

02:30:58.992 --> 02:31:06.599
MATT: "I would do whatever it takes to not trust
individuals who would steal such an artifact with

02:31:06.599 --> 02:31:08.036
"their own means."

02:31:08.036 --> 02:31:10.585
TRAVIS: Sure.

02:31:10.585 --> 02:31:16.571
MATT: "We'll find this individual. Rest assured.
The will of Bahamut turned on him now, I doubt

02:31:16.571 --> 02:31:20.856
"he'll find a place to hide. Thank you very much."

02:31:20.856 --> 02:31:26.666
TRAVIS: Yep. Beep beep. All right, Pike, shall we away?

02:31:26.666 --> 02:31:30.381
ASHLEY: We shall away.

02:31:30.381 --> 02:31:33.176
TRAVIS: Scanlan, shall we away?

02:31:33.176 --> 02:31:35.046
SAM: Away we shall.

02:31:35.046 --> 02:31:36.679
TRAVIS: Away we-- oui oui?

02:31:36.679 --> 02:31:38.750
ASHLEY and SAM: Oui oui!

02:31:38.750 --> 02:31:41.251
SAM, TRAVIS, and ASHLEY: Bidet.

02:31:41.251 --> 02:31:47.530
MATT: "Bidet." As you exit the Sanctuary, you meet
up with the rest of your friends that are still

02:31:47.530 --> 02:31:53.186
taking their quiet moments of reflection on the
exterior platform on the outside of the Sanctuary

02:31:53.186 --> 02:31:56.708
overlooking the eastern side of Vasselheim.

02:31:56.708 --> 02:31:59.394
ASHLEY: How do you feel?

02:31:59.394 --> 02:32:07.876
TRAVIS: I feel good. I feel like pursuing Vecna
was something that we all did together and I feel

02:32:07.876 --> 02:32:16.050
like whatever we do now is new and I felt like I
was going to have to do that on my own and I don't

02:32:16.050 --> 02:32:18.209
want to do that.

02:32:18.209 --> 02:32:20.375
LAURA: Grog, you wouldn't have to do anything on
your own.

02:32:20.375 --> 02:32:23.965
TRAVIS: That's good to know.

02:32:23.965 --> 02:32:26.632
LAURA: Yeah. We're in this together.

02:32:26.632 --> 02:32:31.210
SAM: I've got a thing, actually, I've got to get to.

02:32:31.210 --> 02:32:38.452
LAURA: Can I walk over to Percy? Are you still over
by yourself?

02:32:38.452 --> 02:32:43.548
TALIESIN: Well, yeah. I'll take care of something.
I'm sitting in a corner and I'm staring into the

02:32:43.548 --> 02:32:54.390
reflection of my sword. And I'm gently tapping the
contract in my pocket. And I'm going to say,

02:32:54.390 --> 02:32:57.039
Ipkesh.

02:32:57.039 --> 02:32:59.523
LAURA: No. I'm going to sit down next to you.

02:32:59.523 --> 02:33:12.301
TALIESIN: You're too late. You've been doing a
thing. Could you bring him back? Would it, the

02:33:12.301 --> 02:33:16.666
thing that you gave me, bring him back?

02:33:16.666 --> 02:33:18.872
MATT: There's no answer.

02:33:18.872 --> 02:33:31.895
TALIESIN: Hmm. Nothing at all. All right.

02:33:31.895 --> 02:33:37.819
LAURA: Now I'm going to sit down next to you. How
are you?

02:33:37.819 --> 02:33:59.967
TALIESIN: I have no idea. I think I really miss my
family. I think I miss my sisters and my parents.

02:33:59.967 --> 02:34:16.444
I think I was going to be a clockmaker once. I
haven't thought about that. There was a moment. Do

02:34:16.444 --> 02:34:18.009
you remember when we met?

02:34:18.009 --> 02:34:19.622
LAURA: I do.

02:34:19.622 --> 02:34:31.732
TALIESIN: I, for a brief time, thought that I had
died within that prison and I was having a fever

02:34:31.732 --> 02:34:41.801
dream from starvation and this was what that felt
like, was my mind making stories of friends and

02:34:41.801 --> 02:34:49.486
adventures and these things I would never do
because I was a coward and fool. I miss my family

02:34:49.486 --> 02:35:04.350
so much and I've done some terrible things. I gave
Grog that sword.

02:35:04.350 --> 02:35:06.161
LAURA: You did.

02:35:06.161 --> 02:35:10.740
TALIESIN: It didn't feel real.

02:35:10.740 --> 02:35:13.872
LAURA: Now it does.

02:35:13.872 --> 02:35:22.356
TALIESIN: I don't know. This is new. I'm sorry.

02:35:22.356 --> 02:35:33.701
LAURA: What were you going to do? Are you going to
fight the Raven Queen for me?

02:35:33.701 --> 02:35:47.358
TALIESIN: Many years ago, I went to make a deal
with her and she told me that I was broken and

02:35:47.358 --> 02:35:55.623
that I had always been broken. Part of me was
going to save your brother and really, I just

02:35:55.623 --> 02:36:01.866
wanted to prove it to her. I wanted to hurt her
for hurting me.

02:36:01.866 --> 02:36:05.724
LAURA: I think we're all broken, Percy.

02:36:05.724 --> 02:36:08.334
TALIESIN: I am so tired of hurting people.

02:36:08.334 --> 02:36:14.905
LAURA: You don't have to hurt anyone anymore.

02:36:14.905 --> 02:36:16.930
TALIESIN: I love you very much.

02:36:16.930 --> 02:36:18.293
LAURA: I love you.

02:36:18.293 --> 02:36:20.131
TALIESIN: This has been a terrible day.

02:36:20.131 --> 02:36:22.352
LAURA: It's horrible!

02:36:22.352 --> 02:36:29.504
TALIESIN: Where's Kiki? Where's Scanlan? I think I
owe him an apology. Oh god, I owe Grog an apology.

02:36:29.504 --> 02:36:33.538
Maybe I'll not apologize to Grog. That sounds like
a really terrible idea.

02:36:33.538 --> 02:36:35.916
LAURA: Darling.

02:36:35.916 --> 02:36:37.126
TALIESIN: Yes?

02:36:37.126 --> 02:36:46.208
LAURA: You're a good person and you're not broken
anymore. All right? We'll filling each other's

02:36:46.208 --> 02:36:49.363
gaps. We'll be the glue.

02:36:49.363 --> 02:36:51.682
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:36:51.682 --> 02:37:06.797
LAURA: And don't do anything crazy anymore. No
deals with Raven Queens, all right? Let's not

02:37:06.797 --> 02:37:08.908
fight any more gods.

02:37:08.908 --> 02:37:13.245
TALIESIN: I was going to say let's destroy
the one in Whitestone. Maybe we could seal it up,

02:37:13.334 --> 02:37:15.228
leave it because you know, but--

02:37:15.228 --> 02:37:20.264
LAURA: I want to see if I can talk to him
through it. Is that stupid?

02:37:20.264 --> 02:37:31.163
TALIESIN: How would I know? Seems worth a shot.
I'm too tired to be angry.

02:37:31.163 --> 02:37:40.262
LAURA: We did a thing today. A pretty big thing.

02:37:40.262 --> 02:37:44.332
TALIESIN: Was that today? It legitimately feels
like a week ago at this point.

02:37:44.332 --> 02:37:50.413
(laughter)

02:37:50.413 --> 02:38:03.562
TALIESIN: It's been a long day. Yeah, we'll
rejoin. Sorry about Manners. That was rude.

02:38:03.562 --> 02:38:06.204
SAM: Are you apologizing for something?

02:38:06.204 --> 02:38:07.390
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:38:07.390 --> 02:38:08.993
SAM: That's stupid.

02:38:08.993 --> 02:38:10.274
TALIESIN: I know.

02:38:10.274 --> 02:38:12.251
SAM: I never said sorry for leaving!

02:38:12.251 --> 02:38:17.404
TALIESIN: Yeah, but you're you. You don't have to
apologize, we just assume.

02:38:17.404 --> 02:38:23.918
SAM: Well, I'm sorry. Sorry I left.

02:38:23.918 --> 02:38:27.852
TALIESIN: I will not accept it so that when you
come to your senses later, you don't feel like

02:38:27.852 --> 02:38:30.332
you've compromised. But thank you.

02:38:30.332 --> 02:38:34.959
(laughter)

02:38:34.959 --> 02:38:36.945
SAM: That's fair.

02:38:36.945 --> 02:38:41.242
TRAVIS: You handing out apologies?

02:38:41.242 --> 02:38:48.109
TALIESIN: No. Yes. Sorry about the skull.

02:38:48.109 --> 02:38:52.535
MARISHA: Oh. I'm pretty sure you just handed out
an apology after you just said you weren't going

02:38:52.535 --> 02:38:54.102
to hand out an apology.

02:38:54.102 --> 02:38:58.264
TALIESIN: I'm a human. I'm made of contradictions.
You people wouldn't understand.

02:38:58.264 --> 02:39:01.035
MARISHA: I think Percy is a walking
contradiction.

02:39:01.035 --> 02:39:06.130
TRAVIS: I will consider accepting your apology if
you tell me whatever happened to it.

02:39:06.130 --> 02:39:11.809
TALIESIN: (sighs) Oh my god. I legitimately don't
remember.

02:39:11.809 --> 02:39:14.047
MARISHA: I thought-- wait, we--

02:39:14.047 --> 02:39:21.525
MATT: At that point, two hands drape around the
side of Grog's shoulder up top and Vex as the long

02:39:21.525 --> 02:39:28.827
golden braids down the arms of Allura Vysoren
says, "My friend Grog, best not to worry about it.

02:39:28.827 --> 02:39:32.420
"Wherever it is, it's beyond our grasp now."

02:39:32.420 --> 02:39:34.932
TRAVIS: Okay, Allura.

02:39:34.932 --> 02:39:43.017
(laughter)

02:39:43.017 --> 02:39:48.281
MARISHA: Did you just sitcom mug? "Okay, Allura!"

02:39:48.281 --> 02:39:54.387
(laughter)

02:39:54.387 --> 02:39:56.696
MATT: If we could've freeze-framed and rolled credits
on that to end the campaign, I would have been

02:39:56.696 --> 02:40:07.277
happy. (laughs) Allura takes her hands back, then
reaches over and musses up the side of Pike's

02:40:07.277 --> 02:40:13.326
hair. (sighs) "We've been through quite a bit
together, haven't we?"

02:40:13.326 --> 02:40:17.865
LAURA: So much.

02:40:17.865 --> 02:40:20.734
MATT: "Lot of ups and downs."

02:40:20.734 --> 02:40:25.820
MARISHA: You were quite an inspiration, Allura. I
hope you know. You inspired me quite a lot.

02:40:25.820 --> 02:40:33.507
MATT: "I'm only doing what everybody else is doing
in this world: make it up as you go along."

02:40:33.507 --> 02:40:42.663
MARISHA: We know a lot about that. Allura, is
Vasselheim going to be looking for members to join

02:40:42.663 --> 02:40:44.630
the council?

02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:52.553
MATT: "Vasselheim? What do you mean? Vasselheim is
mostly a religious council, if you know."

02:40:52.553 --> 02:40:55.905
MARISHA: Totally.

02:40:55.905 --> 02:41:02.379
MATT: "I could put in a word, but I didn't 
consider this really your type of--"

02:41:02.379 --> 02:41:03.345
MARISHA: No, right.

02:41:03.345 --> 02:41:04.405
MATT: "Here?"

02:41:04.405 --> 02:41:06.994
SAM: She's asking for somebody else, I'm pretty
sure she wasn't asking for her.

02:41:06.994 --> 02:41:08.616
MARISHA: I actually was, actually.

02:41:08.616 --> 02:41:11.487
MATT: "Oh. I can inquire."

02:41:11.487 --> 02:41:16.062
MARISHA: I was thinking Pike, but I don't know--

02:41:16.062 --> 02:41:22.630
MATT: "If I do recall, you have a temple here. One
that you pretty much built."

02:41:22.630 --> 02:41:24.736
TALIESIN: How is that temple right now?

02:41:24.736 --> 02:41:37.502
MATT: "That's a very good question. Pike? Would
you like to go see your temple?"

02:41:37.502 --> 02:41:41.604
ASHLEY: I would like to go see my temple.

02:41:41.604 --> 02:41:46.828
MATT: "Very well." She waves her fingers a bit and
casts Fly on all of you.

02:41:46.828 --> 02:41:49.207
LAURA: Oh shit, on everybody?!

02:41:49.207 --> 02:41:51.172
MATT: On a high enough level, you can.

02:41:51.172 --> 02:41:55.255
ASHLEY: Whoa.

02:41:55.255 --> 02:42:04.840
TRAVIS: Pike! Go upside down! (wookiee growl)

02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:07.707
LAURA: That was the best wookiee noise you've ever
made, babe!

02:42:07.707 --> 02:42:09.443
TALIESIN: That was a really good wookiee noise.

02:42:09.443 --> 02:42:11.120
TRAVIS: (mediocre wookiee growl)

02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:20.092
MATT: Retracted immediately. As she was here
helping defend, she didn't waste her 8th-level

02:42:20.092 --> 02:42:25.743
slot, she is able to get you guys all flying for
the moment and you all coast. As she finishes

02:42:25.743 --> 02:42:29.993
casting the spell, you could see some of the
nearby wardens of the Platinum Sanctuary go,

02:42:29.993 --> 02:42:38.547
"Um--" "I know it's arcane, shut up. It's fine."
You all take off the steps and begin to glide down

02:42:38.547 --> 02:42:47.856
over to the city, and there you can already see
people are coming out of their homes. Exactly. So

02:42:47.856 --> 02:42:52.542
eventually, you find your way north to the
Quadroads, towards the base of the Heaven Stair

02:42:52.542 --> 02:42:58.954
Mountain, where the temple resides. The temple
looks like it's sustained a little bit of damage. It

02:42:58.954 --> 02:43:06.585
looks like a portion of the upper floor of the
three-tier tower-- Colosseum-esque, but it does

02:43:06.630 --> 02:43:13.400
taper a bit towards the top. The top part has
partially fallen in and it looks like it's seen wear

02:43:13.400 --> 02:43:21.336
and tear, but it doesn't look like it's been
destroyed or anything. As you come up to the

02:43:21.336 --> 02:43:27.179
temple, you can already see there are refugees of
homes that were destroyed from the incursion of

02:43:27.179 --> 02:43:32.053
the Braving Grounds that are being gathered in and
the temple's filled with people. On the outside,

02:43:32.053 --> 02:43:41.146
you see Gesyra, the older woman who helped you
found the temple and build it. As she

02:43:41.146 --> 02:43:44.828
approaches, she's now one of the Priests of
Rebirth and has been working with you for some

02:43:44.828 --> 02:43:50.007
time and turns and sees your face. You can see her
graying hair, which is bunned up very tightly in

02:43:50.007 --> 02:43:57.942
the back. She has her spectacles and she has the
long robes of blue and gold. She sees you. "My

02:43:57.942 --> 02:44:03.484
"Pike!" She rushes up and gives you a hug. She's
much bigger than you, being a human, but her

02:44:03.484 --> 02:44:08.082
posture puts her almost on your level. "I'm so
glad you're safe."

02:44:08.082 --> 02:44:10.566
ASHLEY: It's so wonderful to see your face.

02:44:10.566 --> 02:44:16.155
MATT: "We've housed who we can. We're a bit at
capacity at the moment."

02:44:16.155 --> 02:44:21.387
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, it looks a bit better than I
thought it would.

02:44:21.387 --> 02:44:26.552
MATT: "We did our best to defend. Is it done?"

02:44:26.552 --> 02:44:30.380
ASHLEY: It's done.

02:44:30.380 --> 02:44:39.858
MATT: You see her eyes crack at that moment and
tears begin to flow. She smiles. "I knew you could

02:44:39.858 --> 02:44:41.383
"do it."

02:44:41.383 --> 02:44:43.958
ASHLEY: Well, we all did.

02:44:43.958 --> 02:44:50.931
MATT: She looks around at the rest of you, pats
you on the head for a minute and pulls away and

02:44:50.931 --> 02:44:56.502
goes, "You get to wear the greatest outfits, don't
you?"

02:44:56.502 --> 02:44:59.276
ASHLEY: (giggles)

02:44:59.276 --> 02:45:09.523
MATT: "Well, anything you need, food, we have room
for a few more."

02:45:09.523 --> 02:45:19.088
SAM: I would suggest that we-- there's bars here,
right? In Vasselheim? They drink, don't they?

02:45:19.088 --> 02:45:22.771
MATT: Oh, yeah. There's bars here.

02:45:22.771 --> 02:45:24.897
MARISHA: Maybe they do a dry city after a certain
time.

02:45:24.897 --> 02:45:31.058
MATT: Are you kidding me? Religion and alcohol go
together perfectly. That's a time-honored

02:45:31.058 --> 02:45:32.534
tradition!

02:45:32.534 --> 02:45:41.131
SAM: Why don't we go find a tavern somewhere and
let these people pick up the pieces, and give them

02:45:41.131 --> 02:45:43.051
their space?

02:45:43.051 --> 02:45:47.178
MARISHA: Do you need any type of water, or
anything we can immediately assist you with?

02:45:47.178 --> 02:45:49.538
MATT: "Clean water would be wonderful."

02:45:49.538 --> 02:45:51.451
MARISHA: Do you have somewhere to put it?

02:45:51.451 --> 02:45:57.606
MATT: "Just a moment!" And she goes inside for a
moment and calls out, four of the other lower

02:45:57.606 --> 02:46:02.923
acolytes of Sarenrae's temple, and they all have
various buckets and reservoirs--

02:46:02.923 --> 02:46:07.891
MARISHA: I burn as many Create Water spells as it
takes to fill them up.

02:46:07.891 --> 02:46:12.767
MATT: They bring you inside, where there's the
large statue of Sarenrae, where you had your first

02:46:12.767 --> 02:46:17.947
vision that called you to come find her. And there
is a fountain as part of that and a reservoir in

02:46:17.947 --> 02:46:22.784
the bottom that has currently been mostly emptied
to facilitate everyone here who needed water or to

02:46:22.784 --> 02:46:29.897
clean wounds. You help fill that and you very,
very quickly manage to get the temple back to an

02:46:29.897 --> 02:46:32.046
easily sustainable level.

02:46:32.046 --> 02:46:33.658
TALIESIN: Pike?

02:46:33.658 --> 02:46:35.415
ASHLEY: Yes?

02:46:35.415 --> 02:46:47.458
TALIESIN: I could use your assistance. I don't
think I should have this, and I need this to be

02:46:47.458 --> 02:46:54.281
taken away from me before I do something foolish.
And I hand Pike my contract.

02:46:54.281 --> 02:47:04.082
ASHLEY: (sighs) I take it. Percy, what is this?

02:47:04.082 --> 02:47:15.558
TALIESIN: This, I thought, was proof that I was in
control of myself. But it's just a terrible thing

02:47:15.613 --> 02:47:17.921
waiting to happen.

02:47:17.921 --> 02:47:20.184
SAM: Ashley, I just texted you the contract.

02:47:20.184 --> 02:47:24.360
TALIESIN: Thank you. How do you have it on
autosave?! Do you just have it?

02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:25.834
SAM: Yeah.

02:47:25.834 --> 02:47:30.810
ASHLEY: I mean, I somewhat know what it is.

02:47:30.810 --> 02:47:35.519
TALIESIN: I don't think it can be destroyed. But
maybe it can be put far away.

02:47:35.519 --> 02:47:42.697
ASHLEY: I will keep this, at the very least, very
far from you.

02:47:42.697 --> 02:47:48.840
TALIESIN: I have every faith in you. Thank you. I
think I'm done with that.

02:47:48.840 --> 02:48:00.844
SAM: Pike, I have a porno book that I really think
I shouldn't have anymore. Can I give it to you to

02:48:00.844 --> 02:48:01.941
take it away--

02:48:01.941 --> 02:48:03.107
TALIESIN: I'll take it away!

02:48:03.107 --> 02:48:04.311
SAM: Oh, you'll take it? Okay.

02:48:04.311 --> 02:48:07.074
TRAVIS: I would like to bid on it, as well. Yeah,
I have some money still--

02:48:07.074 --> 02:48:09.724
SAM: It's not great.

02:48:09.724 --> 02:48:11.279
TALIESIN: Can you text it to us actually?

02:48:11.279 --> 02:48:14.095
ASHLEY: Could you text me the book?

02:48:14.095 --> 02:48:15.621
SAM: Sure.

02:48:15.621 --> 02:48:20.667
TALIESIN: That's a three jpeg, man. Sorry.

02:48:20.667 --> 02:48:25.039
MATT: So you guys go off to find a tavern and
drink together?

02:48:25.039 --> 02:48:26.123
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:48:26.123 --> 02:48:29.640
SAM: Yeah. We need to go have some toasts to Vax.

02:48:29.640 --> 02:48:32.559
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

02:48:32.559 --> 02:48:34.260
MATT: All right.

02:48:34.260 --> 02:48:37.899
LAURA: You said Allura took Velora?

02:48:37.899 --> 02:48:44.042
MATT: Yeah. Well, at this point, she's probably
still carrying her with you.

02:48:44.042 --> 02:48:46.709
LAURA: Oh, okay. I thought you said Allura took
her away. Okay.

02:48:46.709 --> 02:48:50.762
MATT: Yeah, because Allura took her off of you--
You know what? No, she's probably being tended to

02:48:50.762 --> 02:48:53.499
at the Platinum Sanctuary at the moment, seeing to
her wounds.

02:48:53.499 --> 02:48:55.849
LAURA: Did I just leave her? I feel weird just
leaving her.

02:48:55.849 --> 02:48:58.109
MARISHA: She'll be fine. She'll be safe.

02:48:58.109 --> 02:48:59.881
TRAVIS: She's in some pretty solid hands.

02:48:59.881 --> 02:49:03.483
LAURA: I'll run back and talk to her.

02:49:03.483 --> 02:49:08.693
MATT: Okay. So you head back into the Sanctuary
and retrieve her.

02:49:08.693 --> 02:49:14.106
LAURA: I'm going to make sure her wounds were
tended because she was pretty busted up.

02:49:14.106 --> 02:49:21.191
MATT: She was. Thankfully, there are a number of
clerics and healers available that can take a

02:49:21.191 --> 02:49:26.554
moment away from the wounded of the battle to deal
with a little girl. And when you come to her,

02:49:26.554 --> 02:49:30.595
she's still a bit battered and bruised. But she's
all right.

02:49:30.595 --> 02:49:38.668
LAURA: Is there anyone who can send me to
Syngorn?

02:49:38.668 --> 02:49:42.771
TALIESIN: Why doesn't she stay with us for a
while?

02:49:42.771 --> 02:49:47.094
MATT: You're asking this of anybody at the
temple?

02:49:47.094 --> 02:49:49.581
LAURA: Do you think we should--

02:49:49.581 --> 02:49:52.168
SAM: We can take a day.

02:49:52.168 --> 02:49:58.084
TALIESIN: I think maybe a little time spent in our
company, as opposed to your father's company,

02:49:58.084 --> 02:50:00.962
would not be the worst idea.

02:50:00.962 --> 02:50:06.273
LAURA: Maybe a message of Sending. Can anyone do
that? Pike? Do you have the message of Sending?

02:50:06.273 --> 02:50:07.962
SAM: To whom?

02:50:07.962 --> 02:50:09.247
LAURA: To my father.

02:50:09.247 --> 02:50:12.161
MARISHA: To let him know that his daughter is
still alive.

02:50:12.161 --> 02:50:15.103
ASHLEY: I don't have it with me, but I--

02:50:15.103 --> 02:50:18.161
LAURA: Okay. Allura, you've done it before.

02:50:18.161 --> 02:50:20.723
MATT: "Yes."

02:50:20.723 --> 02:50:23.224
LAURA: Could you send something to my father?

02:50:23.224 --> 02:50:26.836
MATT: "I could. I could also bring her there, if
you'd like."

02:50:26.836 --> 02:50:32.201
LAURA: No. Velora, would you want to go home right
now?

02:50:32.201 --> 02:50:43.270
MATT: Right now she's holding onto your neck a
bit. She looks at you. "I miss you."

02:50:43.270 --> 02:50:45.537
LAURA: I miss you too.

02:50:45.537 --> 02:50:46.805
MATT: "Can I stay a bit longer?"

02:50:46.805 --> 02:50:47.683
LAURA: Okay.

02:50:47.683 --> 02:50:48.580
MATT: "Okay."

02:50:48.580 --> 02:50:50.077
TALIESIN: I think that's a great idea.

02:50:50.077 --> 02:51:00.206
LAURA: I think so too. Allura, will you say that
Velora is safe, and that I'll be paying a visit

02:51:00.206 --> 02:51:03.332
very soon to return her?

02:51:03.332 --> 02:51:10.616
MATT: "I believe that," and for a moment she looks
just beyond your eyes, squints, "he's aware."

02:51:10.616 --> 02:51:12.529
LAURA: Thank you.

02:51:12.529 --> 02:51:16.738
MATT: "So to drinks?"

02:51:16.738 --> 02:51:19.510
LAURA and TALIESIN: To drinks.

02:51:19.510 --> 02:51:25.379
MATT: "I don't really drink. But after a day like
today, I think I need one."

02:51:25.379 --> 02:51:26.944
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:51:26.944 --> 02:51:28.802
LAURA: Apple juice for you, little one!

02:51:28.802 --> 02:51:33.563
MATT: She giggles in your ear. All right.

02:51:33.563 --> 02:51:36.340
LAURA: I'm bringing my sister to a bar.

02:51:36.340 --> 02:51:37.985
SAM: Your nearly dead sister.

02:51:37.985 --> 02:51:40.358
MARISHA: Yeah. She's going to have to be
introduced at some point.

02:51:40.358 --> 02:51:44.391
MATT: Yeah. Allura takes a moment and squints her
eyes for a second, apparently Sending another

02:51:44.391 --> 02:51:53.545
message, and then nodding. She leads you guys
towards the Quadroads, and finds a pub called The

02:51:53.545 --> 02:52:04.410
Quarry's End. And it's not too far from Sarenrae's
temple, which is why she chose it, and it looks to

02:52:04.410 --> 02:52:09.974
be like it was near a quarry that was built into
the mountain that either dried up or was closed

02:52:09.974 --> 02:52:15.194
down for some reason, and then a tavern was opened
instead as a means of still making money. It's

02:52:15.194 --> 02:52:25.615
super dive-y, it smells of stained wood and
spilled wine. It's musty and perfect. And as you

02:52:25.615 --> 02:52:30.566
all come in, it's mostly empty, as people are
still in the process of trying to figure things

02:52:30.566 --> 02:52:33.585
out. The few that are in there appear to be
wounded soldiers that, as opposed to getting

02:52:33.585 --> 02:52:38.168
medical help, are in the process of drinking
themselves into a numb state. But you find a

02:52:38.168 --> 02:52:49.573
table, you sit down, one of the barmaids comes up
to you, goes: "Drinking away the fray, are you?"

02:52:49.573 --> 02:52:52.879
TALIESIN: I put, like, 20 gold on the table.

02:52:52.879 --> 02:52:54.625
MATT: "Oh!"

02:52:54.625 --> 02:53:01.583
TALIESIN: We will take the cheapest, worst beer
you have, and a round for everyone in the bar.

02:53:01.583 --> 02:53:04.919
MATT: "But of course, sir! My pleasure!" Takes the
coin.

02:53:04.919 --> 02:53:06.351
TALIESIN: If everyone's all right with that.

02:53:06.351 --> 02:53:07.557
LAURA: Of course, dear.

02:53:07.557 --> 02:53:13.476
TRAVIS: Can I also start pulling out the remaining
eight expensive-ass bottles of wine from the bag

02:53:13.476 --> 02:53:14.559
of holding?

02:53:14.559 --> 02:53:18.390
MARISHA: Hell yeah! Drunk as shit! Now's the
time!

02:53:18.390 --> 02:53:26.301
MATT: Within moments, your table is covered in
terrible beer and really expensive wine!

02:53:26.301 --> 02:53:27.805
TRAVIS: Expensive-ass!

02:53:27.805 --> 02:53:29.364
LAURA: That's what you wrote down, too.

02:53:29.364 --> 02:53:31.003
TRAVIS: Expensive-ass bottles of wine.

02:53:31.003 --> 02:53:34.306
MATT: You pull two tables together and you guys
are in the process-- You're a fair bit into your

02:53:34.306 --> 02:53:42.108
cups, and then the somewhat ajar door on the
exterior slams open as the light filters in from

02:53:42.108 --> 02:53:46.548
the outside, and there you see standing the
general half-height of an armored halfling,

02:53:46.548 --> 02:53:51.168
partially bloodied, armor dented as shit.

02:53:51.168 --> 02:53:52.582
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Kima!

02:53:52.582 --> 02:53:56.946
MATT: Kima, as she walks in, sauntering in, with
her blade being sheathed in the back

02:53:56.946 --> 02:54:02.627
of her giant scabbard, her Holy Avenger. "Got your
message, honey! Not going to pass up a drink after a

02:54:02.627 --> 02:54:09.181
"day like this!" (cracking) "Ow, ow, ow!" She comes
and sits down next to Allura and puts her arm

02:54:09.181 --> 02:54:15.344
around her real fast. "This is new!" and points to
the drink in front of Allura.

02:54:15.344 --> 02:54:17.887
TALIESIN: It's a special occasion.

02:54:17.887 --> 02:54:19.524
MARISHA: We're bad influences.

02:54:19.524 --> 02:54:21.343
TRAVIS: Yeah. Desperate times and all that.

02:54:21.343 --> 02:54:23.782
MATT: "Good. I guess that's why we're friends."

02:54:23.782 --> 02:54:26.028
MARISHA: I see you're working the late shift.

02:54:26.028 --> 02:54:31.452
MATT: "Well, you know. When there's streets
crawling with skeletons, I got to be there."

02:54:31.452 --> 02:54:33.884
TALIESIN: Been having a good time, then?

02:54:33.884 --> 02:54:41.204
MATT: "Oh, it's been amazing! It's been terrible!
Terrible. But amazing!"

02:54:41.204 --> 02:54:43.285
MARISHA: Well, we frontloaded our hours.

02:54:43.285 --> 02:54:45.064
LAURA: Can we have another cup?

02:54:45.064 --> 02:54:53.061
MATT: "Yeah!" The barmaid comes by, gets another
cup, and leaves you guys all to drink and swap stories.

02:54:53.061 --> 02:54:56.709
TALIESIN: That thing that I was bugging you
about?

02:54:56.709 --> 02:55:00.139
MARISHA: Which one? You bug me about a lot of
things.

02:55:00.139 --> 02:55:06.824
TALIESIN: Well, that's fair. Now that I have a bit
of alcohol in me.

02:55:06.824 --> 02:55:10.784
MARISHA: Yeah, and you ask me after I have a bit
of alcohol in me. And I scry on Cassandra.

02:55:10.784 --> 02:55:12.686
MATT: Okay.

02:55:12.686 --> 02:55:18.095
TALIESIN: Oh god, he flipped a page. I hate that.

02:55:18.095 --> 02:55:24.579
MATT: You take a long, deep sip of your drink and
then close your eyes as you complete the scrying

02:55:24.579 --> 02:55:31.729
ritual you've half-scrawled on the dark wood wall
on the side of the tavern. Your vision goes

02:55:31.729 --> 02:55:37.231
cloudy, and you feel yourself being transitioned
rapidly through wind and cloud as the temperature

02:55:37.231 --> 02:55:41.632
of your atmosphere begins to drop, and there, you
begin to break cloud cover to look down upon

02:55:41.632 --> 02:55:43.014
Whitestone.

02:55:43.014 --> 02:55:49.944
Your vision jumps once more to the exterior of the
castle, jumps once more, and there you see, lying

02:55:49.944 --> 02:55:59.044
in bed, covers pulled up to her chest, with at
least three different servants and one medical

02:55:59.044 --> 02:56:07.289
personnel there at her side, bag open, tending to
her wounds. She's asleep, but she's breathing.

02:56:07.289 --> 02:56:14.163
MARISHA: Looks like she's been tended to like a
proper de Rolo.

02:56:14.163 --> 02:56:18.163
LAURA: Did you see Kaylie and Gilmore?

02:56:18.163 --> 02:56:19.394
MARISHA: Did I see Kaylie and Gilmore?

02:56:19.394 --> 02:56:20.574
MATT: Not in the room, no.

02:56:20.574 --> 02:56:23.188
TALIESIN: She made it back to Whitestone. One
would assume that's how she got there.

02:56:23.188 --> 02:56:30.846
MARISHA: She was not doing well. Gilmore was the
most able-bodied. I'm assuming he got her there. I hope.

02:56:30.846 --> 02:56:34.183
TALIESIN: I'm sure. I have faith.

02:56:34.183 --> 02:56:37.510
MARISHA: I'll scry on the rest of them tomorrow.

02:56:37.510 --> 02:56:40.807
TALIESIN: I'm drunk. Don't get used to it.

02:56:40.807 --> 02:56:43.601
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Faithless until the end.

02:56:43.601 --> 02:56:50.415
MARISHA: Thank you, Percy.

02:56:50.415 --> 02:56:52.487
PERCY: Thank you, Keyleth.

02:56:52.487 --> 02:57:00.132
MARISHA: You taught me just the right amount of
how to be a shithead. Just enough.

02:57:00.132 --> 02:57:07.725
SAM: We should toast to Vax'ildan, our fallen
member.

02:57:07.725 --> 02:57:12.498
MATT: At which point, Kima goes, "Yeah, where is
that asshole, anyway?"

02:57:12.498 --> 02:57:14.219
SAM: He's really stealthy.

02:57:14.219 --> 02:57:17.565
MATT: "Ain't that the truth. All right." She grabs
her cup.

02:57:17.565 --> 02:57:21.970
LAURA: Apple juice.

02:57:21.970 --> 02:57:25.501
MATT: She's holding a cup.

02:57:25.501 --> 02:57:27.852
SAM: What do you have, Ashley?

02:57:27.852 --> 02:57:35.358
ASHLEY: I have a cup, and it's a vintage cup. I
don't need to talk about this.

02:57:35.358 --> 02:57:40.172
(laughter)

02:57:40.172 --> 02:57:45.392
MATT: Glasses raised, and at this point as the
glasses are raised, you can hear whispers off to

02:57:45.392 --> 02:57:49.934
the side. You glance over, and you can see one of
the nearby tables, which is filled with four

02:57:49.934 --> 02:57:53.675
Bastions who had been drinking to the battle and
have now taken notice and seemingly recognized

02:57:53.675 --> 02:57:58.607
who's at the table across the way. They're all
staring, and they all grab their glasses and raise

02:57:58.607 --> 02:58:00.169
them, too.

02:58:00.169 --> 02:58:03.704
LAURA: To Vax'ildan. He was the best of us.

02:58:03.704 --> 02:58:06.904
MARISHA: The most selfless.

02:58:06.904 --> 02:58:10.661
SAM: The most frequently naked.

02:58:10.661 --> 02:58:14.348
MARISHA: Second to you.

02:58:14.348 --> 02:58:16.808
TRAVIS: The most frustrating.

02:58:16.808 --> 02:58:19.105
TALIESIN: The brightest and the darkest.

02:58:19.105 --> 02:58:22.965
SAM: That's true. To Vax.

02:58:22.965 --> 02:58:34.619
ALL: To Vax.

02:58:34.658 --> 02:58:39.456
MATT: "So. What comes next?"

02:58:39.456 --> 02:58:42.160
TRAVIS: What does come next?

02:58:42.160 --> 02:58:54.218
MARISHA: (sighs) It's hard to think after a day
that feels like a week, like today.

02:58:54.218 --> 02:59:01.794
LAURA: Syngorn and Whitestone, I would assume.

02:59:01.794 --> 02:59:06.923
TALIESIN: Home for a bit, at least. And of course,
&lt;i&gt;everybody&lt;/i&gt; is welcome, always.

02:59:06.923 --> 02:59:09.682
MARISHA: I've got to get back to Zephrah.

02:59:09.682 --> 02:59:12.623
SAM: Do we have to check on Greyskull Keep?

02:59:12.623 --> 02:59:14.552
LAURA: In Emon?

02:59:14.552 --> 02:59:15.747
SAM: I don't know.

02:59:15.747 --> 02:59:17.185
LAURA: Someone should stay there.

02:59:17.185 --> 02:59:21.144
TRAVIS: We left it as an outpost. I wouldn't mind
going back to Whitestone for a bit.

02:59:21.144 --> 02:59:30.480
TALIESIN: I'll also say, for those of you,
especially. Grog, you have your freedoms, and if

02:59:30.480 --> 02:59:36.563
you wanted to become lord of Greystone and have a
place of your own that you could invite us to, as

02:59:36.563 --> 02:59:38.343
opposed to wandering.

02:59:38.343 --> 02:59:39.353
MARISHA: Greyskull?

02:59:39.353 --> 02:59:40.642
TALIESIN: Greyskull.

02:59:40.642 --> 02:59:46.475
TRAVIS: (hesitant noises)

02:59:46.475 --> 02:59:48.475
LAURA: Or you could just hang in Whitestone.

02:59:48.475 --> 02:59:52.514
TRAVIS: I'll think about it. It seems like that
has responsibilities.

02:59:52.514 --> 02:59:55.440
LAURA: The Grand Poobah has a lot of
responsibilities, too.

02:59:55.440 --> 02:59:58.342
TRAVIS: I do. There is an updated tour.

02:59:58.342 --> 03:00:07.582
SAM: We'll go to Whitestone and figure it out.
That's where Kaylie is, right? We assume.

03:00:07.582 --> 03:00:09.405
LAURA: Potentially.

03:00:09.405 --> 03:00:11.675
MARISHA: I don't think I can go back to Whitestone
with you.

03:00:11.675 --> 03:00:12.880
LAURA: Why?

03:00:12.880 --> 03:00:15.643
SAM: Oh, why? You've got to go back to your
people?

03:00:15.643 --> 03:00:17.269
MARISHA: I have to go back to Zephrah.

03:00:17.269 --> 03:00:22.025
TALIESIN: Well, I think we're going to need help
getting to Whitestone, and then I think it's going

03:00:22.025 --> 03:00:27.538
to take at least a day for you to regain the power
to return to your people.

03:00:27.538 --> 03:00:30.971
MARISHA: Bad influences, all of you. Assholes.

03:00:30.971 --> 03:00:34.593
TALIESIN: We're not getting rid of you quite that
easily.

03:00:34.593 --> 03:00:39.264
MARISHA: All right. One day.

03:00:39.264 --> 03:00:41.129
TRAVIS: If you can bear it.

03:00:41.129 --> 03:00:45.910
MARISHA: And then I want to not see your faces for
a bit.

03:00:45.910 --> 03:00:49.641
SAM: Sure, that makes sense. Pikey-poo, where are
you going?

03:00:49.641 --> 03:00:57.200
ASHLEY: Well, I'd like to come with you guys for a
little bit because frankly, I don't really want to

03:00:57.200 --> 03:00:59.177
be alone for a while.

03:00:59.177 --> 03:01:00.857
TALIESIN: I don't think any of us do.

03:01:00.857 --> 03:01:02.721
TRAVIS: I pull her into the biggest hug.

03:01:02.721 --> 03:01:04.990
ASHLEY: Oh, P-- oh, Grog.

03:01:04.990 --> 03:01:12.074
TRAVIS: You almost called me your own name. It's
okay. You'll be fine.

03:01:12.074 --> 03:01:16.973
ASHLEY: I was going to call you Poobah, but then I
wanted to say your real name.

03:01:16.973 --> 03:01:26.414
MARISHA: We could go back to Whitestone whenever.
I've still got a little bit of juice left.

03:01:26.414 --> 03:01:28.669
LAURA: You've got enough juice to get us to
Whitestone right now?

03:01:28.669 --> 03:01:31.665
MARISHA: I do, believe it or fucking not.

03:01:31.665 --> 03:01:35.278
TRAVIS: I don't. You gave us the option.

03:01:35.278 --> 03:01:36.770
MARISHA: What?

03:01:36.770 --> 03:01:39.683
TRAVIS: You said believe it or fucking not. I call
nope.

03:01:39.683 --> 03:01:47.760
MARISHA: Oh, it was more of a rhetorical-- it's
like a trick or treat-- why do we still try to

03:01:47.760 --> 03:01:50.029
explain things to him? I haven't learned.

03:01:50.029 --> 03:01:51.892
ASHLEY: Because he's learning.

03:01:51.892 --> 03:01:55.287
MATT: Kima's clasping her cup and goes, "I can
watch this all day."

03:01:55.287 --> 03:01:57.168
TRAVIS: Thank you, Pike.

03:01:57.168 --> 03:02:00.105
ASHLEY: He learns something new every day.

03:02:00.105 --> 03:02:03.412
TALIESIN: How did Whitestone look?

03:02:03.412 --> 03:02:10.544
MATT: It's blurred at a distance. Aside from the
specific target of your scrying, you don't get

03:02:10.544 --> 03:02:13.426
much of a vision, just an idea of the blurry
exterior.

03:02:13.426 --> 03:02:15.508
LAURA: Should we drunkenly walk to the tree?

03:02:15.508 --> 03:02:19.069
SAM: Are we transporting tonight? Why don't we
chill for a night?

03:02:19.069 --> 03:02:21.065
LAURA: Don't you want to see your daughter?

03:02:21.065 --> 03:02:23.515
SAM: Well, of course, but I'm drunk and bloody.

03:02:23.515 --> 03:02:31.210
MARISHA: We can drunkenly walk there and take our
time and enjoy the stars and we can-- oh!

03:02:31.210 --> 03:02:32.300
Scanlan--

03:02:32.300 --> 03:02:33.498
SAM: Did you have a drink?

03:02:33.498 --> 03:02:34.526
MARISHA: Scanlan.

03:02:34.526 --> 03:02:36.133
SAM: What can we do?

03:02:36.133 --> 03:02:46.301
MARISHA: We can do little arcane cantrips when no
one's looking and break the rules a little bit. Of

03:02:46.301 --> 03:02:48.614
Vasselheim. Just cantrips, though.

03:02:48.614 --> 03:02:50.141
SAM: You're such a rebel.

03:02:50.141 --> 03:02:51.170
MARISHA: I know.

03:02:51.170 --> 03:02:53.145
TALIESIN: I forgot.

03:02:53.145 --> 03:02:54.679
MARISHA: What?

03:02:54.679 --> 03:02:55.930
TALIESIN: No, you're fine.

03:02:55.930 --> 03:02:56.838
MARISHA: What?

03:02:56.838 --> 03:02:59.585
TALIESIN: Nothing. You're fine. Love you very
much.

03:02:59.585 --> 03:03:03.435
MARISHA: I've lost the love of my life today. I'm
allowed to be belligerent.

03:03:03.435 --> 03:03:04.607
TALIESIN: You are.

03:03:04.607 --> 03:03:06.261
TRAVIS: Are we throwing caution to the wind?

03:03:06.261 --> 03:03:07.506
SAM: Sure.

03:03:07.506 --> 03:03:11.636
TRAVIS: I do have something that might up the
party a little bit.

03:03:11.636 --> 03:03:12.905
SAM: Okay, what is it?

03:03:12.905 --> 03:03:15.885
TRAVIS: I reach into the bag of holding and I pull
out a little leather pouch.

03:03:15.885 --> 03:03:17.340
MARISHA: Do you have that sandkheg shit?

03:03:17.340 --> 03:03:18.471
LAURA: No.

03:03:18.471 --> 03:03:19.498
TRAVIS: What?

03:03:19.498 --> 03:03:20.907
SAM: What is that? What have you got?

03:03:20.907 --> 03:03:27.762
TRAVIS: So I've got this little deck of cards and
every time someone pulls from it, great shit

03:03:27.762 --> 03:03:29.041
happens.

03:03:29.041 --> 03:03:31.067
ASHLEY: I'm in.

03:03:31.067 --> 03:03:36.511
TRAVIS: One. Two. Scanlan?

03:03:36.511 --> 03:03:44.286
SAM: I've seen this before, haven't I? I think I
was with you when you got the guy rich. Wasn't I?

03:03:44.286 --> 03:03:46.129
MATT: No, he was on his own.

03:03:46.129 --> 03:03:48.380
TRAVIS: He's the Lord of the Quadroads now.

03:03:48.380 --> 03:03:50.377
SAM: I was with him when he did one of them,
though.

03:03:50.377 --> 03:03:55.453
MATT: You're semi-aware that there's something
going on. Make an arcana check.

03:03:55.453 --> 03:03:58.153
TALIESIN: Oh, this could go so badly.

03:03:58.153 --> 03:04:01.277
SAM: 15.

03:04:01.277 --> 03:04:05.668
MATT: 15. Something creeping in the back of your
mind, something you've learned, something you've

03:04:05.668 --> 03:04:11.106
heard, really tells you that this is powerful and
chaotic.

03:04:11.106 --> 03:04:16.174
SAM: I'll watch for now.

03:04:16.174 --> 03:04:17.596
TRAVIS: You'll partake.

03:04:17.596 --> 03:04:18.830
SAM: Probably.

03:04:18.830 --> 03:04:22.617
TRAVIS: Three. Percy?

03:04:22.617 --> 03:04:27.980
TALIESIN: I think I've had enough for one day.

03:04:27.980 --> 03:04:31.316
SAM: If we're going to do that, we should go back
to Whitestone first.

03:04:31.316 --> 03:04:36.197
TRAVIS: Why? This place is already fucked up.
Let's get it on. Keyleth?

03:04:36.197 --> 03:04:44.699
MARISHA: I am drunk enough to where I'm not going
to stop it or argue against it, but I won't

03:04:44.699 --> 03:04:47.040
partake, so that's pretty good for me.

03:04:47.040 --> 03:04:50.488
TRAVIS: Why are you so resistant to gifts and
wonder? Magic?

03:04:50.488 --> 03:04:55.940
MARISHA: Grog, you've had two weapons speak to
you--

03:04:55.940 --> 03:04:57.658
TRAVIS: Don't be jelly.

03:04:57.658 --> 03:05:02.510
LAURA: Nothing powerful comes without a price. We
saw that. We just saw that with the Raven Queen.

03:05:02.510 --> 03:05:07.698
Power comes at a price. You think that wonderful
things are going to be pulled out of your hands

03:05:07.698 --> 03:05:09.984
here, and there's going to be no consequences?

03:05:09.984 --> 03:05:11.241
TRAVIS: Pretty much.

03:05:11.241 --> 03:05:15.552
MARISHA: Grog, haven't we been through enough shit
to know nothing's free?

03:05:15.552 --> 03:05:17.741
TRAVIS: What?

03:05:17.741 --> 03:05:19.347
MARISHA: Fuck it.

03:05:19.347 --> 03:05:23.397
TRAVIS: Here or Whitestone?

03:05:23.397 --> 03:05:25.363
TALIESIN: Oh, definitely not at Whitestone.

03:05:25.363 --> 03:05:26.999
TRAVIS: All right. Pike, you want one?

03:05:26.999 --> 03:05:31.438
(laughter)

03:05:31.438 --> 03:05:33.763
TALIESIN: I've always worried about the two of
you.

03:05:33.763 --> 03:05:44.567
ASHLEY: Well, I think you should pick a card, and
we deal with one as of right now. And then maybe

03:05:44.567 --> 03:05:46.965
I'll pick one later.

03:05:46.965 --> 03:05:51.905
TRAVIS: Well, jeez, I thought we were all having
tequila shots and going crazy and taking pictures

03:05:51.905 --> 03:05:56.931
and writing our name on the bathroom walls, but it
seems like everybody's lost their nerve. I put it

03:05:56.931 --> 03:05:59.238
back in the bag of holding.

03:05:59.238 --> 03:06:01.677
(laughter and groaning)

03:06:01.677 --> 03:06:02.977
MATT: You're such an asshole!

03:06:02.977 --> 03:06:04.830
TALIESIN: You're such a dick.

03:06:04.830 --> 03:06:08.030
LAURA: Don't do it!

03:06:08.030 --> 03:06:13.118
MARISHA: You insult our resolve and hold out on us
all at the same time?

03:06:13.118 --> 03:06:15.252
TRAVIS: The night's still young.

03:06:15.252 --> 03:06:17.417
ASHLEY: Ugh, just pick one!

03:06:17.417 --> 03:06:19.226
MATT: All right.

03:06:19.226 --> 03:06:22.718
SAM: We're traveling now? We're drunk!

03:06:22.718 --> 03:06:24.039
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:06:24.039 --> 03:06:27.038
TALIESIN: Let's drive a tree. It'll be fun.

03:06:27.038 --> 03:06:32.592
MATT: You all wander outside of the tavern, find
your way over to the nearest tree that's

03:06:32.592 --> 03:06:35.428
functional. It takes you a little bit, because a
lot of trees look thicker at a distance when

03:06:35.428 --> 03:06:37.449
you're drunk than when you approach.

03:06:37.449 --> 03:06:41.160
MARISHA: Yeah, no, this one won't work. No, this
won't work. Sorry.

03:06:41.160 --> 03:06:42.978
TALIESIN: That's more of a shrub.

03:06:42.978 --> 03:06:45.298
MARISHA: Sorry. Next one. That one looks good.

03:06:45.298 --> 03:06:46.728
TALIESIN: Yes, that looks nice.

03:06:46.728 --> 03:06:48.418
SAM: That's a young boy.

03:06:48.418 --> 03:06:52.189
TALIESIN: Oh, yes.

03:06:52.189 --> 03:06:57.261
MATT: Eventually, you find the tree that'll work,
which is interesting, because you have this

03:06:57.261 --> 03:07:03.166
combination of people that are recognizing you as
Vox Machina, as the whispered saviors of the town

03:07:03.166 --> 03:07:08.700
as you drunkenly stumble through the city streets,
naught but hours after sealing a recently ascended

03:07:08.700 --> 03:07:17.223
god. It's strangely so perfect for you. As you
approach the tree that you find that'll work,

03:07:17.223 --> 03:07:29.829
Allura has her arm over Kima. She's a lightweight.
"You go on ahead. We need to help here with the

03:07:29.829 --> 03:07:33.105
"construction effort."

03:07:33.105 --> 03:07:36.094
LAURA: You've got to get your construction on?

03:07:36.094 --> 03:07:39.370
MATT: "No, we're just--" And then Kima goes,
"Yes!"

03:07:39.370 --> 03:07:42.699
TRAVIS: (laughing) She doesn't handle that booze
very well.

03:07:42.699 --> 03:07:52.413
MATT: "We'll see you soon. Travel safe, and thank
you."

03:07:52.413 --> 03:07:55.152
SAM: Love you.

03:07:55.152 --> 03:07:57.976
MATT: "Okay."

03:07:57.976 --> 03:08:01.894
(laughter)

03:08:01.894 --> 03:08:08.345
MATT: Kima drags her hand. Kima's drank far more,
but is sober. She can hold her liquor. "All right,

03:08:08.345 --> 03:08:12.846
"thank you, guys!" And grabs her hand and pulls her
off, and they both wave bye as they step back into

03:08:12.846 --> 03:08:14.304
the city.

03:08:14.304 --> 03:08:22.586
You complete your spell, emerging from the
exterior of the Sun Tree. Back in Whitestone, the

03:08:22.586 --> 03:08:30.288
comfort is here once more. It seems to be just
past dusk at this point.

03:08:30.288 --> 03:08:45.105
MARISHA: (slurred) See? When you travel-- wait,
no. When you travel west to east, you gain time. See?

03:08:45.105 --> 03:08:47.293
SAM: Yeah, you called it.

03:08:47.293 --> 03:08:49.016
ASHLEY: Time travel.

03:08:49.016 --> 03:08:54.843
MARISHA: (slurred) Happy hour is right now in
Whitestone. Just saying.

03:08:54.843 --> 03:08:56.956
TALIESIN: Let's head home?

03:08:56.956 --> 03:08:58.415
SAM: That works.

03:08:58.415 --> 03:09:00.592
MARISHA: Okay. Heading home works.

03:09:00.592 --> 03:09:05.575
MATT: You guys make your way to the castle. Food
is presented. Everyone's happy to see you back.

03:09:05.575 --> 03:09:08.420
What do you want to do?

03:09:08.420 --> 03:09:13.667
SAM: Now or forever?

03:09:13.667 --> 03:09:15.808
MATT: Oh, we'll get to the forever bit in a
minute.

03:09:15.808 --> 03:09:19.657
MARISHA: Cry myself to sleep?

03:09:19.657 --> 03:09:24.137
SAM: I want to go see Kaylie, I guess, if she's
around. Are we hanging out together, or are we

03:09:24.137 --> 03:09:25.599
breaking off?

03:09:25.599 --> 03:09:27.379
LAURA: (quietly) Go see your daughter.

03:09:27.379 --> 03:09:28.763
SAM: All right. I'm going to go see Kaylie.

03:09:28.763 --> 03:09:33.668
MATT: Okay. Asking around a bit, it doesn't take
much to find Kaylie in your old room in

03:09:33.668 --> 03:09:41.316
Whitestone, the one where you both left when you
first exited the group for a short time. She's in

03:09:41.316 --> 03:09:49.790
there, bandaged up, and looks like she's taking a
dagger and throwing it into the wall, then walking

03:09:49.790 --> 03:09:56.405
over and pulling it back out, sitting back on the
bed and throwing it, and it bounces off. The hilt

03:09:56.405 --> 03:10:00.958
hits. She's like, "Fuck." Picks it back up and
doesn't notice you in the doorway. As she sits

03:10:00.958 --> 03:10:03.367
back down, she looks over.

03:10:03.367 --> 03:10:07.242
SAM: Hi.

03:10:07.242 --> 03:10:09.480
MATT: "Hi."

03:10:09.480 --> 03:10:13.826
SAM: You with a dagger in your hand's always a
little scary.

03:10:13.826 --> 03:10:16.596
MATT: "Why, does it frighten you?"

03:10:16.596 --> 03:10:19.622
SAM: Not any--

03:10:19.622 --> 03:10:20.630
MATT: "Boo!"

03:10:20.630 --> 03:10:23.334
SAM: (yelps) Okay, it frightens me a little.

03:10:23.334 --> 03:10:26.882
MATT: She sheathes it on the side.

03:10:26.882 --> 03:10:28.832
SAM: You okay?

03:10:28.832 --> 03:10:37.191
MATT: "I've had better days. I'm all right."

03:10:37.191 --> 03:10:38.511
SAM: Good.

03:10:38.511 --> 03:10:39.908
MATT: "You're alive."

03:10:39.908 --> 03:10:45.614
SAM: Surprisingly, yes. We won.

03:10:45.614 --> 03:10:50.686
MATT: "I figured, if you're standing here before
me. That's good. Congratulations."

03:10:50.686 --> 03:10:59.534
SAM: Thanks. I'm sorry that I had to go do that. I
had to.

03:10:59.534 --> 03:11:04.299
MATT: "I'd be disappointed if you'd've came back
with me. More important things."

03:11:04.299 --> 03:11:15.399
SAM: So what now? Do you want to go back to
Ank'Harel and keep criming?

03:11:15.399 --> 03:11:27.537
MATT: You watch for a brief second her tough
exterior break, and you can see her eyes welling

03:11:27.537 --> 03:11:40.203
up a little bit. She looks at the ground for a
minute, then looks back up at you. "I'm glad

03:11:40.203 --> 03:11:42.898
"you're safe."

03:11:42.898 --> 03:11:51.771
SAM: I'm so happy I got to see you again. I
thought for a second that when we said goodbye, it

03:11:51.771 --> 03:11:54.141
was the last time.

03:11:54.141 --> 03:12:04.747
MATT: "I didn't. I know you too well, at this
point. You're too much of a turd to die."

03:12:04.747 --> 03:12:13.435
SAM: That's true. Only good people die.

03:12:13.435 --> 03:12:25.613
MATT: "I'd like to go back to Ank'Harel. I don't
know if this whole Meat Man thing's for me

03:12:25.613 --> 03:12:26.958
"anymore."

03:12:26.958 --> 03:12:34.823
SAM: Yeah. No, I hear you. I don't know if it's
for me, either. It was fun.

03:12:34.823 --> 03:12:37.177
MATT: "It was a lot of fun!"

03:12:37.177 --> 03:12:46.137
SAM: It felt like we were killing time a little
bit. There's something else that we should do. I

03:12:46.137 --> 03:12:49.926
don't know what. Maybe your thing won't be my
thing.

03:12:49.926 --> 03:12:54.179
MATT: "Let's find someone to pass on the mantle
to, eh?"

03:12:54.179 --> 03:12:55.973
SAM: That's a good idea.

03:12:55.973 --> 03:12:59.157
MATT: "I think the Meat Man should be there, just
not us."

03:12:59.157 --> 03:13:04.371
SAM: Yeah, that's a great idea. We'll train a
replacement.

03:13:04.371 --> 03:13:09.768
MATT: "Still take a percentage. I mean, we worked
this hard!"

03:13:09.768 --> 03:13:14.852
SAM: Passive income, right? It's the dream.

03:13:14.852 --> 03:13:17.505
MATT: "It's the meat and potatoes of any good
business venture."

03:13:17.505 --> 03:13:19.629
SAM: I should have thought of that. That's
amazing.

03:13:19.629 --> 03:13:28.777
MATT: "That's why the daughter's an upgrade. After
that, I don't know. I hate to admit it, but--"

03:13:28.777 --> 03:13:31.823
SAM: Did you finish school?

03:13:31.823 --> 03:13:33.819
MATT: "No."

03:13:33.819 --> 03:13:36.250
SAM: Do you want to?

03:13:36.250 --> 03:13:43.541
MATT: "Yeah."

03:13:43.541 --> 03:13:54.370
SAM: All right. Well, let's do that, then. You go
to school.

03:13:54.370 --> 03:14:14.316
MATT: "I'm not really made for a lyceum. We can go
visit. I didn't expect you to recommend

03:14:14.316 --> 03:14:16.505
"schooling!"

03:14:16.505 --> 03:14:24.952
SAM: Listen, I've made a lot of mistakes in my
life, and I don't want you to make the same ones.

03:14:24.952 --> 03:14:36.002
I love you, and I want to support you in whatever
you want to do, at this point. My time has come,

03:14:36.002 --> 03:14:44.142
and I've done my thing, and my thing is done, and
now I want to help you do whatever it is that you

03:14:44.142 --> 03:14:55.628
want to do. If that means I can be close to you,
then great, but if it doesn't, then I'll come

03:14:55.628 --> 03:15:01.983
visit every once in a while. We made quite a bit
of money as the Meat Man.

03:15:01.983 --> 03:15:04.081
MATT: "Aye, that we did."

03:15:04.081 --> 03:15:08.700
SAM: And it's a good sum to get started.

03:15:08.700 --> 03:15:14.165
MATT: "Would it be enough to pay for a right
top-end education so I can gloat over all the

03:15:14.165 --> 03:15:21.897
"other kids that are raised by the various lords
and ladies of Emon? Become one of those privileged kids."

03:15:21.897 --> 03:15:24.716
SAM: You can have the best education.

03:15:24.716 --> 03:15:29.309
MATT: "That's what I want to do. I want to rub it
in their face."

03:15:29.309 --> 03:15:36.660
SAM: All right. Education for spite. I like that.

03:15:36.660 --> 03:15:41.292
MATT: "That sounds like a Shorthalt endeavor."

03:15:41.292 --> 03:15:44.737
SAM: Sure. Whatever you need.

03:15:44.737 --> 03:15:50.000
MATT: She stands up from the bed and walks over
and puts her hand on your shoulder in a pat, pat.

03:15:50.000 --> 03:16:02.025
She pulls you into a hug and rests her head on
your shoulder and doesn't say anything.

03:16:02.025 --> 03:16:06.218
SAM: You won't have to worry about me anymore.

03:16:06.218 --> 03:16:09.776
MATT: "I'm going to worry about you every day."

03:16:09.776 --> 03:16:18.457
SAM: Thank you. Thank you for coming into my
life.

03:16:18.457 --> 03:16:23.340
MATT: "Thank you for being enough of a shitbag to
bring me into it."

03:16:23.340 --> 03:16:33.170
SAM: I'm so happy. I made so many mistakes, but it
turns out that some of them weren't mistakes,

03:16:33.170 --> 03:16:35.337
after all.

03:16:35.337 --> 03:16:45.865
MATT: "I'm still young and unlearned. Time will
tell." She pulls you a little tighter in.

03:16:45.865 --> 03:16:51.346
SAM: I'll snuggle and fall asleep in the room at
some point.

03:16:51.346 --> 03:16:59.401
MATT: She smells the alcohol on your breath and
(groans). "Go lie there. I'm going to--" (groans)

03:16:59.401 --> 03:17:11.002
She winces as her wound in her shoulder flares up.
"I need some fresh air. You go to sleep."

03:17:11.002 --> 03:17:19.474
Exhaustion hits you, and you end up passing out at
the foot of the bed.

03:17:19.474 --> 03:17:21.351
SAM: I'm in my room now?

03:17:21.351 --> 03:17:23.814
MATT: Yeah, your old room.

03:17:23.814 --> 03:17:29.963
LAURA: I'm going to tuck Velora into bed.

03:17:29.963 --> 03:17:35.577
MATT: She's asleep by the time you get there.
Travel and everything has tuckered her out. You

03:17:35.577 --> 03:17:38.799
tuck her in, put the blanket up.

03:17:38.799 --> 03:17:46.343
LAURA: I tiptoe out of the room, and I find
Percy.

03:17:46.343 --> 03:17:48.545
TALIESIN: I'll be in Cassandra's room.

03:17:48.545 --> 03:17:52.247
LAURA: Percival?

03:17:52.247 --> 03:17:53.739
TALIESIN: Yes?

03:17:53.739 --> 03:17:56.592
LAURA: Could I talk to you for a moment?

03:17:56.592 --> 03:17:58.102
TALIESIN: Of course.

03:17:58.102 --> 03:18:10.629
LAURA: I completely understand if you want to stay
with Cassandra for the night. Would you mind not being

03:18:10.629 --> 03:18:17.472
very comfortable, though? I was thinking of
camping in the woods.

03:18:17.472 --> 03:18:29.504
TALIESIN: I think that sounds lovely, and you're
always better than comfortable. I had a thought,

03:18:29.504 --> 03:18:47.722
actually. My god, it is hard surviving, isn't it?
Perhaps Keyleth could use a friend right now, and

03:18:47.722 --> 03:18:51.666
I know that you carry one with you.

03:18:51.666 --> 03:18:54.006
LAURA: Trinket?

03:18:54.006 --> 03:19:05.640
TALIESIN: Just for a bit. I think she could use a
companion who's not going to apologize or give too

03:19:05.640 --> 03:19:07.361
much sympathy.

03:19:07.361 --> 03:19:14.721
LAURA: Of course. I send Trinket to Keyleth's
room.

03:19:14.721 --> 03:19:18.385
MATT: As Trinket ascends the stairs, he looks back
over the shoulder. (questioning noise)

03:19:18.385 --> 03:19:25.340
LAURA: She might cry a lot on you. All right,
dear?

03:19:25.340 --> 03:19:30.415
MATT: Makes it up the stairs.

03:19:30.415 --> 03:19:35.571
LAURA: It's going to be a lot harder to stay warm
out in the woods now.

03:19:35.571 --> 03:19:41.904
TALIESIN: We'll figure something out. I grew up
here. I'm used to it.

03:19:41.904 --> 03:19:51.426
LAURA: I wanted to remember how I used to camp
with Vax when we were kids.

03:19:51.426 --> 03:19:55.318
TALIESIN: I'd like to see that.

03:19:55.318 --> 03:20:04.893
LAURA: I guess we go out and set up a little
fire.

03:20:04.893 --> 03:20:10.408
MATT: You guys make your way into the woods and
set up a camp for the evening's rest together.

03:20:10.408 --> 03:20:24.526
Keyleth, are you in your room? The door (creaks)
and Trinket comes in and stares right at you.

03:20:24.526 --> 03:20:33.527
(slurps) And licks up the side of your face. Your
hair sticks up for a minute.

03:20:33.527 --> 03:20:35.330
MARISHA: Oh, buddy!

03:20:35.330 --> 03:20:42.567
MATT: (bear noises) He leans in and plops down on
the ground, a giant beanbag mound of bear fur.

03:20:42.567 --> 03:20:56.166
MARISHA: I cover Trinket with snot and tears as I
sob into his belly. First night alone, but with

03:20:56.166 --> 03:20:57.244
Trinket.

03:20:57.244 --> 03:20:58.894
TALIESIN: Best teddy bear ever.

03:20:58.894 --> 03:21:01.840
MARISHA: Aware of the gesture. I cry.

03:21:01.840 --> 03:21:07.134
MATT: Eventually the exhaustion and the alcohol
hits you, and you fall asleep, cuddled up in the

03:21:07.134 --> 03:21:12.372
warm embrace of a very fantastic, recently
meteor-struck bear.

03:21:12.372 --> 03:21:17.043
MARISHA: Drool and eyeliner and dirt.

03:21:17.043 --> 03:21:21.376
MATT: Voice of the Tempest.

03:21:21.376 --> 03:21:24.177
SAM: You were wearing eyeliner to our fight?

03:21:24.177 --> 03:21:28.765
MARISHA: Remember, I charcoal war-painted?

03:21:28.765 --> 03:21:30.669
SAM: That makes sense.

03:21:30.669 --> 03:21:33.842
TRAVIS: Has everybody gone off?

03:21:33.842 --> 03:21:37.253
MATT: Pike actually would still be around.

03:21:37.253 --> 03:21:45.126
TRAVIS: I make my way sneakily outside.

03:21:45.126 --> 03:21:47.125
MATT: Pike, what are you doing?

03:21:47.125 --> 03:21:52.913
ASHLEY: There's a couple of things.

03:21:52.913 --> 03:21:56.188
TALIESIN: There's a lovely tea rose garden in the
back.

03:21:56.188 --> 03:21:58.958
SAM: She's letting Grog go first.

03:21:58.958 --> 03:22:00.582
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

03:22:00.582 --> 03:22:05.986
ASHLEY: If you wanted to go somewhere, sneak
away.

03:22:05.986 --> 03:22:09.032
TRAVIS: Oh, you know, I was just gonna, um.

03:22:09.032 --> 03:22:17.238
MATT: Who wants to go first? Pike? Grog? Who's
going first?

03:22:17.238 --> 03:22:24.966
ASHLEY: Just for a little bit, for about an hour,
I want to go-- not deep into the woods where

03:22:24.966 --> 03:22:34.986
Percy and Vex are, but somewhere that's pretty for
about an hour, and I'll make my way back.

03:22:34.986 --> 03:22:44.804
MATT: As you're out there on your own,
contemplating quietly, ruminating on the day, a

03:22:44.804 --> 03:22:53.830
faint howl finds the air, and stepping from the
shadows, you see a large gray wolf: Galdric, the

03:22:53.830 --> 03:22:59.913
wolf that once belonged to the previous champion
of the Raven Queen, Purvan, who was given charge

03:22:59.913 --> 03:23:07.428
over the forests on the outside. Saunters up to
you. He is a large wolf. You are a tiny gnome. He

03:23:07.428 --> 03:23:15.114
steps up, sits next to you.

03:23:15.114 --> 03:23:22.643
In this little break in the trees where you can
see the moon breaking through some of the passing

03:23:22.643 --> 03:23:28.415
clouds over Whitestone. The night is so cold, you
can see your breath in the dark air through the

03:23:28.415 --> 03:23:35.566
beams of moonlight that make it through the
canopy. As the wolf looks down at you, his intense

03:23:35.566 --> 03:23:44.460
eyes making a full scan of what you are, there's a
recognition to his expression. The wolf looks back

03:23:44.460 --> 03:23:58.435
up. (howls) And gives a long, baleful howl,
seemingly in remembrance and acknowledging that

03:23:58.435 --> 03:24:05.945
one with a familiar path to his has found his way
back to the realm of the Raven Queen, as well.

03:24:05.945 --> 03:24:22.758
ASHLEY: You are a beautiful creature. This might
be strange, but I give him a hug.

03:24:22.758 --> 03:24:31.713
MATT: You hug Galdric. You're used to Trinket,
who's pretty well manicured. Galdric, not so much.

03:24:31.713 --> 03:24:36.865
There are clusters of fur that are
dirt-encrusted.

03:24:36.865 --> 03:24:38.662
TRAVIS: Shit in them.

03:24:38.662 --> 03:24:47.100
MATT: Probably. He's not a full, ruined beast. He
lives in the forest. Smells of earth, dust, and

03:24:47.100 --> 03:24:52.601
nature. Doesn't seem to react to your hug, but
allows it.

03:24:52.601 --> 03:24:57.000
ASHLEY: I sit next to him.

03:24:57.000 --> 03:25:02.644
MATT: He seems to share the space with you for the
time that you're in the forest. Not a strong

03:25:02.644 --> 03:25:07.194
connection, but an acknowledgement, mainly
focusing on the moon before it passes through the

03:25:07.194 --> 03:25:09.254
canopy and is no longer visible.

03:25:09.254 --> 03:25:18.564
ASHLEY: I came out here to build a little
something, so I'm glad to have you out here for a

03:25:18.564 --> 03:25:26.057
little bit. Thank you for staying with me.

03:25:26.057 --> 03:25:31.101
MATT: The one ear to the side perks open to listen
to your statement, but the vision doesn't meet

03:25:31.101 --> 03:25:38.514
yours, still focused in space as it fades. You get
the essence that the wolf acknowledges you.

03:25:38.514 --> 03:25:54.959
ASHLEY: (sighs) I feel like Grog would be so happy
right now to be around a wolf. I give him a

03:25:54.959 --> 03:25:56.894
scratch behind his ear.

03:25:56.894 --> 03:26:02.651
MATT: He actually seems to enjoy it and gives into
it. One of the giant hind legs of the wolf--

03:26:02.651 --> 03:26:11.797
ASHLEY: Oh, that's a good boy. I give out a little
howl.

03:26:11.797 --> 03:26:16.744
MATT: He howls along with you. (howls)

03:26:16.744 --> 03:26:21.300
ASHLEY: That was for my friend Vax.

03:26:21.300 --> 03:26:33.885
MATT: The wolf gets up, circles you once, and
makes his way into the darkness of the forest once more.

03:26:33.885 --> 03:26:44.833
ASHLEY: Goodbye. After a bit, I head back.

03:26:44.833 --> 03:26:47.623
MATT: Okay. Grog?

03:26:47.623 --> 03:26:53.697
TRAVIS: I wander outside, where I'm by myself. Do
I see anyone?

03:26:53.697 --> 03:26:56.385
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:26:56.385 --> 03:27:00.558
TRAVIS: Like it matters. Oh! 17.

03:27:00.558 --> 03:27:06.113
MATT: Glancing about, there are some of the Pale
Guard around. Nobody that you would be looking

03:27:06.113 --> 03:27:09.741
for, necessarily. You seem to be open to do as you
please.

03:27:09.741 --> 03:27:25.487
SAM: Yeah.

03:27:25.487 --> 03:27:27.309
TRAVIS: I pull a card.

03:27:27.309 --> 03:27:28.486
SAM: Yes!

03:27:28.486 --> 03:27:31.986
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you.

03:27:31.986 --> 03:27:33.992
MARISHA: Wait, where are you?

03:27:33.992 --> 03:27:35.826
LAURA: Outside of the castle.

03:27:35.826 --> 03:27:38.690
MARISHA: In the middle of fucking Whitestone?

03:27:38.690 --> 03:27:40.716
MATT: Oh my god, Grog.

03:27:40.716 --> 03:27:43.735
ASHLEY: Wait, as I'm walking back, do I see him at
all?

03:27:43.735 --> 03:27:48.259
MATT: (chuckles) Out in front of the castle, out
in the courtyard area?

03:27:48.259 --> 03:27:50.645
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's nighttime.

03:27:50.645 --> 03:27:52.314
MATT: Make a perception check, Pike.

03:27:52.314 --> 03:27:53.909
SAM: Make it good.

03:27:53.909 --> 03:27:55.948
TALIESIN: Roll a natural 20.

03:27:55.948 --> 03:27:59.915
ASHLEY: I rolled a natural 20.

03:27:59.915 --> 03:28:01.594
MARISHA: Shut your mouth!

03:28:01.594 --> 03:28:05.003
TRAVIS: I rolled a bunch of hit dice from our
short rest.

03:28:05.003 --> 03:28:12.093
MATT: As you're quietly climbing up the walkway to
the base of Castle Whitestone--

03:28:12.093 --> 03:28:13.812
ASHLEY: He's out in the open.

03:28:13.812 --> 03:28:18.352
MATT: Yeah. You do. You look up and see Grog pull
a card from the deck.

03:28:18.352 --> 03:28:21.430
ASHLEY: I stand and watch for a moment.

03:28:21.430 --> 03:28:22.962
SAM: Oh, here's the deck.

03:28:22.962 --> 03:28:27.380
LAURA: Oh my god. It is really happening. I can't
fucking believe--

03:28:27.380 --> 03:28:35.699
MARISHA: Travis, pull good! Oh, please don't bring
pit fiends on our heads.

03:28:35.699 --> 03:28:38.059
TRAVIS: I might have.

03:28:38.059 --> 03:28:40.463
SAM: Negative two to everything.

03:28:40.463 --> 03:28:47.452
MATT: Hold on. Deck of Many Things. All right, so.
Grog, what did you pull?

03:28:47.452 --> 03:28:54.096
ASHLEY: Oh shit.

03:28:54.096 --> 03:28:55.489
MATT: Void.

03:28:55.489 --> 03:28:56.951
TALIESIN: Oh no!

03:28:56.951 --> 03:28:58.688
MARISHA: That can't be good.

03:28:58.688 --> 03:29:00.299
MATT: I'm sure it's fine.

03:29:00.299 --> 03:29:02.581
LAURA: That's the worst one you could get!

03:29:02.581 --> 03:29:08.242
SAM: The crew's laughing. Something's bad.
Something's very bad.

03:29:08.242 --> 03:29:09.715
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure--

03:29:09.715 --> 03:29:12.255
LAURA: That is so bad!

03:29:12.255 --> 03:29:17.155
TALIESIN: Oh my god! (laughs)

03:29:17.155 --> 03:29:18.772
SAM: Wait, Pike saw him.

03:29:18.772 --> 03:29:19.974
MATT: Pike.

03:29:19.974 --> 03:29:21.995
SAM: You get a reaction.

03:29:21.995 --> 03:29:24.888
MARISHA: Did our internet go?

03:29:24.888 --> 03:29:30.656
(screaming and groaning)

03:29:30.656 --> 03:29:32.582
MATT: Of all moments.

03:29:32.582 --> 03:29:39.470
TALIESIN: (cackles) This is your doing!

03:29:39.470 --> 03:29:47.187
MATT: While we're here, Grog, I'm going to read
you the card. This black card spells disaster.

03:29:47.187 --> 03:29:53.298
Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in
an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or

03:29:53.298 --> 03:29:56.766
more powerful beings guard the place. While your
soul is trapped in this way, your body is

03:29:56.766 --> 03:30:01.209
incapacitated. A Wish spell can't restore your
soul, but the spell reveals the location of the

03:30:01.209 --> 03:30:03.750
object that holds it. You draw no more cards.

03:30:03.750 --> 03:30:07.645
SAM: Wait, read it again.

03:30:07.645 --> 03:30:14.961
TRAVIS: I'll tell you. My soul is drawn from my
body. My body is incapacitated. It is placed

03:30:14.961 --> 03:30:21.947
within an object that the DM chooses. A Wish spell
will tell you the location of the object, but will

03:30:21.947 --> 03:30:24.038
not reverse the action.

03:30:24.038 --> 03:30:25.833
SAM: Can anything reverse it?

03:30:25.833 --> 03:30:28.790
MATT: Finding it and retrieving the object and
restoring the soul.

03:30:28.790 --> 03:30:33.333
MARISHA: You fucking dick. You're a fucking dick!

03:30:33.333 --> 03:30:38.915
LAURA: Well, the campaign goes on for another-- I
can't believe you just fucking did that.

03:30:38.915 --> 03:30:41.534
SAM: Wait, she rolled.

03:30:41.534 --> 03:30:42.911
LAURA: Ashley?

03:30:42.911 --> 03:30:46.031
SAM: She rolled something. Oh, that was her 20
from before.

03:30:46.031 --> 03:30:51.660
MATT: Looks like we may have her back. Hopefully,
because this is going to be-- oh my god.

03:30:51.660 --> 03:30:59.582
MARISHA: It is bad!

03:30:59.582 --> 03:31:03.499
SAM: Oh my god, Travis. Why would you do that?

03:31:03.499 --> 03:31:09.326
MATT: Give me the card. Let this be a lesson to
everybody out there.

03:31:09.326 --> 03:31:11.075
LAURA: Oh my god!

03:31:11.075 --> 03:31:18.960
MARISHA: You said you weren't going to bring the Deck
of Many Things into the game, and then you did!

03:31:18.960 --> 03:31:22.059
MATT: No regrets.

03:31:22.059 --> 03:31:23.913
TALIESIN: Hashtag no regrets.

03:31:23.913 --> 03:31:26.263
MATT: No "regerts" at all.

03:31:26.263 --> 03:31:30.898
TALIESIN: Oh god, I can't even.

03:31:30.898 --> 03:31:32.922
LAURA: Is Ashley texting?

03:31:32.922 --> 03:31:35.945
TALIESIN: She's just yelling obscenities.

03:31:35.945 --> 03:31:37.391
SAM: Her internet just died.

03:31:37.391 --> 03:31:43.871
MARISHA: (mispronouncing) Worst fucking timing!
Internet has gone! Timing! Worst fucking timing!

03:31:43.871 --> 03:31:46.966
TALIESIN: It's just obscenities. That's all it
is.

03:31:46.966 --> 03:32:00.282
MATT: So Grog, as you draw the card from the deck,
your vision goes tunneled, dark, to a pinpoint: a

03:32:00.282 --> 03:32:11.461
singular pinpoint of deep, ruby red. And that's
all. Your consciousness falls into a catatonic state.

03:32:11.461 --> 03:32:13.330
SAM: Does she get a reaction or anything?

03:32:13.330 --> 03:32:14.533
MATT: No.

03:32:14.533 --> 03:32:16.187
MARISHA: She doesn't get shit? She just watches?

03:32:16.187 --> 03:32:18.188
MATT: She sees it happen.

03:32:18.188 --> 03:32:19.577
SAM: With her 20, she saw!

03:32:19.577 --> 03:32:20.960
MATT: I know. She's aware.

03:32:20.960 --> 03:32:22.685
SAM: She can't yell? She can't cast something?

03:32:22.685 --> 03:32:30.195
MATT: No, because he pulled the card. It's not a
big (grunts). It's a (flip).

03:32:30.195 --> 03:32:31.442
SAM: All right.

03:32:31.442 --> 03:32:36.836
MATT: All righty, so.

03:32:36.836 --> 03:32:41.915
MARISHA: I guess we'll add that to our to do list.

03:32:41.915 --> 03:32:45.553
TALIESIN: I'd like to think that in the next
campaign, we're going to find you in a glass

03:32:45.553 --> 03:32:47.428
coffin like Sleeping fucking Beauty.

03:32:47.428 --> 03:32:48.864
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:32:48.864 --> 03:32:50.941
TRAVIS: My body's still there.

03:32:50.941 --> 03:32:52.713
SAM: She rolled a 17.

03:32:52.713 --> 03:32:55.197
MARISHA: So Grog's body is still there--

03:32:55.197 --> 03:32:57.499
MATT: He's catatonic until the soul's returned.

03:32:57.499 --> 03:32:59.119
MARISHA: Catatonic.

03:32:59.119 --> 03:33:06.888
MATT: To be fair, you've sealed Vecna. At level 19
and 20, this is not going to be an

03:33:06.888 --> 03:33:08.868
earth-shattering experience.

03:33:08.868 --> 03:33:10.030
MARISHA: Sure, it's just an annoyance.

03:33:10.030 --> 03:33:17.717
MATT: And for the sake of the epilogue evening:
you guys, all planning to return to your various

03:33:17.717 --> 03:33:19.685
lives to relax--

03:33:19.685 --> 03:33:23.359
TRAVIS: I'm there catatonic with an open deck of
cards in my hand like this.

03:33:23.359 --> 03:33:27.738
LIAM: You dingus!

03:33:27.738 --> 03:33:30.256
MARISHA: Goddamn it!

03:33:30.256 --> 03:33:32.289
TRAVIS: Somebody's going to find me.

03:33:32.289 --> 03:33:39.166
SAM: To Grog! He was the dumbest of us all. He was
the dumb and the dumb.

03:33:39.166 --> 03:33:41.885
TALIESIN: May he rest in bed sores for all
eternity.

03:33:41.885 --> 03:33:46.457
MATT: You spend the next two weeks finding your
way through the halls of Pandemonium.

03:33:46.457 --> 03:33:48.423
LAURA: I can't fucking believe that shit.

03:33:48.423 --> 03:33:50.628
MARISHA: Wait, we spend two weeks?

03:33:50.628 --> 03:33:52.363
SAM: The halls of Pandemonium?

03:33:52.363 --> 03:33:55.213
MATT: Yes, where his soul is currently
encapsulated.

03:33:55.213 --> 03:33:56.858
SAM: God, you asshole.

03:33:56.858 --> 03:33:58.126
MARISHA: In what?

03:33:58.126 --> 03:34:02.536
TRAVIS: What are the halls of Pandemonium?

03:34:02.536 --> 03:34:09.009
MARISHA: I should be &lt;i&gt;mourning&lt;/i&gt; right now, and I'm
hunting your stupid ass down!

03:34:09.009 --> 03:34:14.122
TRAVIS: I'm keeping you occupied. I really did
this for you.

03:34:14.122 --> 03:34:19.914
MATT: Pandemonium is a plane of madness: a great
mass of rock riddled with tunnels carved by

03:34:19.914 --> 03:34:23.868
howling winds. It is cold, noisy, and dark, with
no natural light. Wind quickly extinguishes

03:34:23.868 --> 03:34:27.808
nonmagical open flames such as torches and
campfires. It also makes conversation possible

03:34:27.808 --> 03:34:33.772
only by yelling, and even then only at a maximum
distance of ten feet. Most of the plane's

03:34:33.841 --> 03:34:37.448
inhabitants are creatures that were banished to
the plane with no hope of escape, and many of them

03:34:37.448 --> 03:34:40.876
have been driven mad by the incessant winds or
forced to take shelter in places where the winds

03:34:40.876 --> 03:34:46.037
die down until they sound like distant cries of
torment. So yeah, that's a fun time. It's a fun

03:34:46.037 --> 03:34:48.363
adventure you guys go on to retrieve Grog's soul.

03:34:48.363 --> 03:34:50.148
MARISHA: Great therapy lesson.

03:34:50.148 --> 03:34:52.233
TRAVIS: We'll one-shot it later.

03:34:52.233 --> 03:34:55.443
(laughter)

03:34:55.443 --> 03:34:58.463
MARISHA: A healing trip.

03:34:58.463 --> 03:35:02.825
SAM: It's a good side quest for the future
someday.

03:35:02.825 --> 03:35:09.687
MATT: A good moment of, "Oh, we're not going to
get a rest." Hopefully, we'll get Ashley back, but

03:35:09.687 --> 03:35:18.599
in the meantime, for the purposes of this, you
come back two weeks after, extremely angry. Grog,

03:35:18.599 --> 03:35:26.743
as suddenly you're restored, and that tiny bead of
light fades back, and you're not outside anymore.

03:35:26.743 --> 03:35:33.409
You're actually sitting in a reclined, cushioned
couch or chair of some kind in Castle Whitestone,

03:35:33.409 --> 03:35:38.657
and all of your currently living friends are all
around you, looking &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; angry.

03:35:38.657 --> 03:35:40.614
TRAVIS: Oh! It got me a chair.

03:35:40.614 --> 03:35:42.157
LAURA: You fucking idiot.

03:35:42.157 --> 03:35:43.166
TRAVIS: What?

03:35:43.166 --> 03:35:44.420
LAURA: I cannot believe you did that.

03:35:44.420 --> 03:35:45.535
TRAVIS: Did what?

03:35:45.535 --> 03:35:51.607
MARISHA: Keyleth backhands him with the hand that
has the most rings on it, of power.

03:35:51.607 --> 03:35:55.254
TRAVIS: Do I lose any hit points?

03:35:55.254 --> 03:35:57.739
MARISHA: Probably not!

03:35:57.739 --> 03:36:00.067
TRAVIS: What? What happened?

03:36:00.067 --> 03:36:03.334
TALIESIN: You lost card privileges.

03:36:03.334 --> 03:36:04.800
SAM: Yep. Hand them over.

03:36:04.800 --> 03:36:08.177
TALIESIN: Oh, we already took the whole deck.

03:36:08.177 --> 03:36:09.624
TRAVIS: Wait!

03:36:09.624 --> 03:36:13.705
SAM: You may lose your belt for this, friend.

03:36:13.705 --> 03:36:17.937
LAURA: Yeah. You're lucky we didn't shave your
beard. Yeah.

03:36:17.937 --> 03:36:20.725
TRAVIS: I fucked up.

03:36:20.725 --> 03:36:22.122
LAURA: You fucked up a lot.

03:36:22.122 --> 03:36:24.380
SAM: Percy lost his arm rescuing you!

03:36:24.380 --> 03:36:28.895
TRAVIS: I'm sorry.

03:36:28.895 --> 03:36:30.140
TALIESIN: Are you?

03:36:30.140 --> 03:36:31.237
TRAVIS: No.

03:36:31.237 --> 03:36:34.269
(laughter)

03:36:34.269 --> 03:36:41.250
TRAVIS: All right. I just thought, it did
fantastic things before! I don't know why it

03:36:41.250 --> 03:36:42.833
doesn't like me so much.

03:36:42.833 --> 03:36:44.777
TALIESIN: I don't think it was personal.

03:36:44.777 --> 03:36:46.620
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

03:36:46.620 --> 03:36:50.089
SAM: You've learned a lesson that we had to pay
for.

03:36:50.089 --> 03:36:54.733
TRAVIS: All right. Sorry, guys. Sorry, Pike.

03:36:54.733 --> 03:36:56.575
ASHLEY: Hello?

03:36:56.575 --> 03:37:02.416
(laughter)

03:37:02.416 --> 03:37:06.261
MATT: Look at that timing. I don't even know,
man.

03:37:06.261 --> 03:37:08.405
SAM: Pike, can you hear us?

03:37:08.405 --> 03:37:12.735
ASHLEY: My internet crashed at the &lt;i&gt;worst&lt;/i&gt; fucking
time.

03:37:12.735 --> 03:37:21.377
MARISHA: We can't even see you right now. You're a
silhouette on the screen, but we can hear you.

03:37:21.377 --> 03:37:23.542
MATT: Pike, do you know what happened?

03:37:23.542 --> 03:37:26.756
SAM: Yeah, I texted her the gist of what
happened.

03:37:26.756 --> 03:37:28.200
ASHLEY: Okay, so you disappeared?

03:37:28.200 --> 03:37:33.242
MATT: Grog's soul was trapped somewhere on the
plane of Pandemonium, and you guys had to take two

03:37:33.242 --> 03:37:39.138
weeks and battle your way through a terrible plane
filled with wind and madness and creatures that

03:37:39.138 --> 03:37:43.577
were banished there to never escape, eventually
battling some terrible beast that was guarding the

03:37:43.577 --> 03:37:49.338
gem that contained his soul, returned, and he just
now woke up on the couch after restoring his

03:37:49.338 --> 03:37:53.558
consciousness to his body, and has been slapped in
the face by Keyleth and told that he lost card

03:37:53.558 --> 03:37:54.626
privileges.

03:37:54.626 --> 03:37:56.168
TRAVIS: (tearfully) And Percy lost his arm!

03:37:56.168 --> 03:38:00.070
ASHLEY: Oh no. Wait, what?!

03:38:00.070 --> 03:38:02.831
SAM: Well, I may have been fibbing about that
part.

03:38:02.831 --> 03:38:05.898
MARISHA: It might be a cheap joke.

03:38:05.898 --> 03:38:08.950
TALIESIN: I might have lost my arm or I might be
hiding it behind my back. I'm not sure.

03:38:08.950 --> 03:38:14.106
TRAVIS: So news flash, pro tip: the cards may be
dangerous.

03:38:14.106 --> 03:38:16.702
TALIESIN: That's good to know.

03:38:16.702 --> 03:38:19.596
ASHLEY: Okay. Maybe we leave it alone, then.

03:38:19.596 --> 03:38:26.140
LAURA: Hey! Hi! Oh my god, that was craziness.

03:38:26.140 --> 03:38:32.116
SAM: Nice. Any other things that we need to wrap
up for the evening?

03:38:32.116 --> 03:38:33.735
TALIESIN: I pull a card from the deck.

03:38:33.735 --> 03:38:37.013
SAM: No! I invoke the third contract.

03:38:37.013 --> 03:38:43.318
MATT: I'll draw the card for you. Whichever one
smashes Whitestone.

03:38:43.318 --> 03:38:45.645
TALIESIN: Suddenly, I lose everything.

03:38:45.645 --> 03:38:47.707
MATT: Exactly. Oh my god, if you pull that card?

03:38:47.707 --> 03:38:48.830
TALIESIN: Wouldn't that be amazing?

03:38:48.830 --> 03:38:50.038
MATT: Don't you even.

03:38:50.038 --> 03:38:51.122
LAURA: Penniless?

03:38:51.122 --> 03:38:53.104
MATT: Everything he owns crumbles to dust.

03:38:53.104 --> 03:38:54.173
TRAVIS: Everything.

03:38:54.173 --> 03:38:55.363
MATT: All material wealth.

03:38:55.363 --> 03:38:57.350
TALIESIN: It's why I don't pull cards!

03:38:57.350 --> 03:38:59.934
MARISHA: How fucked would that be? So fucked.

03:38:59.934 --> 03:39:01.372
SAM: Bring it in.

03:39:01.372 --> 03:39:12.273
MATT: After this unexpected side venture, you all
say your goodbyes for the time being, scatter to

03:39:12.273 --> 03:39:19.414
the various business you have to. Pike? Is there
anything else you wanted to do?

03:39:19.414 --> 03:39:21.007
ASHLEY: Are we leaving?

03:39:21.007 --> 03:39:25.070
MATT: Was there anything else this evening you
needed to situate? I was going to begin to

03:39:25.070 --> 03:39:28.031
facilitate the epilogue.

03:39:28.031 --> 03:39:29.364
SAM: What do you want to do?

03:39:29.364 --> 03:39:33.836
ASHLEY: Can I grab Keyleth and Vex real quick?

03:39:33.836 --> 03:39:37.739
MARISHA: Yeah. Girl power.

03:39:37.739 --> 03:39:43.075
ASHLEY: I'll take them to the little spot where I
was in the woods.

03:39:43.075 --> 03:39:44.668
LAURA: Two weeks ago.

03:39:44.668 --> 03:39:47.781
(laughter)

03:39:47.781 --> 03:39:49.947
TRAVIS: Sorry.

03:39:49.947 --> 03:40:20.533
ASHLEY: Okay. So hey, I put something together.
It's dumb, but I made a bench and I put Vax's name

03:40:20.533 --> 03:40:29.610
on it and I didn't want to make him a headstone
because that seems so final. Maybe he's still

03:40:29.610 --> 03:40:31.202
around somewhere.

03:40:31.202 --> 03:40:33.023
LAURA: He is.

03:40:33.023 --> 03:40:45.991
ASHLEY: I also have these. I take out two of his
feathers that I grabbed. And I thought you could put

03:40:45.991 --> 03:40:51.667
this with the feathers in your hair, Vex and
Keyleth, you could do something with this.

03:40:51.667 --> 03:40:56.499
MARISHA: I think I have the perfect place for
this. Thank you.

03:40:56.499 --> 03:40:58.932
LAURA: Thank you, Pike.

03:40:58.932 --> 03:41:00.470
MARISHA: Thank you so much.

03:41:00.470 --> 03:41:07.764
ASHLEY: I'm sure you could make it look a little
prettier than it is but--

03:41:07.764 --> 03:41:09.804
MARISHA: I think it's perfect.

03:41:09.804 --> 03:41:11.739
LAURA: It's absolutely perfect.

03:41:11.739 --> 03:41:14.008
MARISHA: Where are we going to put it?

03:41:14.008 --> 03:41:17.991
LAURA: Do you want it out in the woods?

03:41:17.991 --> 03:41:20.914
ASHLEY: Maybe we should just leave it here.

03:41:20.914 --> 03:41:22.243
LAURA: I like it.

03:41:22.243 --> 03:41:25.035
MARISHA: I think he'd like that.

03:41:25.035 --> 03:41:27.493
ASHLEY: I think he would too.

03:41:27.493 --> 03:41:31.701
MARISHA: Something you have to stumble upon. It's
a little hidden.

03:41:31.701 --> 03:41:33.692
LAURA: Yeah, it's stealthy!

03:41:33.692 --> 03:41:36.199
MARISHA: Stealthy memorial!

03:41:36.199 --> 03:41:59.335
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll let you guys stay. I just
wanted to do one more thing. Okay, I walk over to

03:41:59.335 --> 03:42:01.193
where Scanlan is.

03:42:01.193 --> 03:42:05.262
SAM: You mean two weeks ago or are we after--

03:42:05.262 --> 03:42:09.661
MATT: No, this is after the random, unexpected
Pandemonium trip.

03:42:09.661 --> 03:42:15.799
ASHLEY: Wait, is Grog on the trip or was that--

03:42:15.799 --> 03:42:19.258
MATT: Well, no. You guys had to go there to find
his soul.

03:42:19.258 --> 03:42:21.204
MARISHA: Grog was the reason for this season!

03:42:21.204 --> 03:42:24.545
TRAVIS: To be fair, nothing really happened in
that mind.

03:42:24.545 --> 03:42:26.543
MATT: That's true.

03:42:26.543 --> 03:42:32.841
ASHLEY: Hey Scanlan!

03:42:32.841 --> 03:42:34.798
SAM: Oi, Pike.

03:42:34.798 --> 03:42:37.719
ASHLEY: How are you doing?

03:42:37.719 --> 03:42:41.619
SAM: Now that Percy's arm has healed, I'm fine.

03:42:41.619 --> 03:42:45.777
ASHLEY: Now that was bad, wasn't it?

03:42:45.777 --> 03:42:49.568
SAM: Yeah. That bugbear came out of nowhere.

03:42:49.568 --> 03:42:55.109
ASHLEY: The bugbear, you said?

03:42:55.109 --> 03:42:57.407
SAM: Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

03:42:57.407 --> 03:43:05.996
ASHLEY: I thought I forgot about that, maybe.
Listen, I'm glad you're alive.

03:43:05.996 --> 03:43:11.731
SAM: Me too. Thanks for saving us all in that big
fight.

03:43:11.731 --> 03:43:25.315
ASHLEY: Thank &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; for saving us all. I don't
really have a whole lot to say, I care for you a

03:43:25.315 --> 03:43:34.570
lot and I wanted to let you know that.

03:43:34.570 --> 03:43:52.320
SAM: I care for you, Pike. I've always loved you
since the moment I met you and I'm so happy that

03:43:52.320 --> 03:43:54.557
we became friends as well.

03:43:54.557 --> 03:43:56.748
ASHLEY: Me too.

03:43:56.748 --> 03:44:05.100
SAM: Thank you for everything. Thank you for
putting up with me when I was a shit and I hope

03:44:05.100 --> 03:44:16.543
that I've become more tolerable for you. After all
that we've been through, I was wondering if I

03:44:16.543 --> 03:44:26.803
could ask you a question. I have a proposal for
you, if you don't mind. Well, now that everything

03:44:26.803 --> 03:44:40.843
is safe again and back to normal, I was wondering
if I could take you on a date. To a restaurant or

03:44:40.843 --> 03:44:47.664
something, then maybe if it goes well, we could go
on another date and that's it.

03:44:47.664 --> 03:44:56.397
ASHLEY: Well, I actually was going to ask you the
same thing!

03:44:56.397 --> 03:45:09.615
SAM: Well then. I'll let you do it! No, you do it!
I don't want to-- I take it back! I don't ask you

03:45:09.615 --> 03:45:11.108
on a date!

03:45:11.108 --> 03:45:17.768
MARISHA: Oh.

03:45:17.768 --> 03:45:20.300
ASHLEY: Oh no.

03:45:20.300 --> 03:45:24.231
SAM: Oh no! The internet! Can you hear me,
Ashley?

03:45:24.231 --> 03:45:26.837
(groaning)

03:45:26.837 --> 03:45:28.543
SAM: Denied.

03:45:28.543 --> 03:45:29.873
TALIESIN: That was amazing!

03:45:29.873 --> 03:45:32.447
LAURA, MATT, and SAM: That was a yes.

03:45:32.447 --> 03:45:39.348
MARISHA: It's 2017. When will we will have better
Skype?

03:45:39.348 --> 03:45:41.298
TALIESIN: That's the most Scanlan thing I could
have ever hoped for.

03:45:41.298 --> 03:45:51.264
MATT: Remember, we're America. We have the worst
Internet in the world. Weirdly. Net neutrality. As

03:45:51.264 --> 03:46:02.991
you guys gather, say your temporary goodbyes, knowing
that you're all still very in touch with each other,

03:46:02.991 --> 03:46:11.508
knowing you care about each other, you begin to forge
whatever life looks like outside of perpetual

03:46:11.508 --> 03:46:25.365
danger and the constant onslaught and struggle of
terrors and heroic necessity. Scanlan.

03:46:25.365 --> 03:46:30.588
SAM: Oh! Sorry, I'm having a text romance with
Ashley Johnson right now.

03:46:30.588 --> 03:46:34.186
MATT: Then I'll come back to you.

03:46:34.186 --> 03:46:39.265
SAM: No. I'm ready. I can pull myself away from
Pike for a second.

03:46:39.265 --> 03:46:47.738
MATT: What does Scanlan do in the next year? Next
five years, next ten years?

03:46:47.738 --> 03:46:57.375
SAM: (clears throat) I have one prepared. Well,
she's not here, so I don't know but I wrote down--

03:46:57.375 --> 03:46:59.021
ASHLEY: Can you hear me at all?

03:46:59.021 --> 03:47:01.196
SAM: Oh god, I love this!

03:47:01.196 --> 03:47:07.023
ASHLEY: Sorry, my Internet keeps going out.

03:47:07.023 --> 03:47:08.598
TRAVIS: It's okay.

03:47:08.598 --> 03:47:11.080
LAURA: Perfect timing, Ash.

03:47:11.080 --> 03:47:19.172
MATT: It's all right. So assuming that you guys
went on a date. I'm discussing with Scanlan his

03:47:19.172 --> 03:47:25.138
epilogue. What does he wish to do in the next
year, five and ten years?

03:47:25.138 --> 03:47:35.786
SAM: My plan, what I wrote down, was find Kaylie,
make sure she's okay. Help Pike repair Vasselheim

03:47:35.786 --> 03:47:52.081
or literally whatever she wants to do. Give all
money to Kaylie except for my platinum bracelets

03:47:52.081 --> 03:48:01.392
with sapphires worth 2,500 gold that I send
anonymously to Sybil to make sure she's taken care

03:48:01.392 --> 03:48:18.380
of. Long term, I would like to use my
Wish/Teleport to check on Kaylie every now and

03:48:18.380 --> 03:48:20.973
then, at school or wherever she ends up.

03:48:20.973 --> 03:48:24.453
MATT: She ends up at the Alabaster Lyceum in Emon,
which is one of the highest places of learning.

03:48:24.453 --> 03:48:28.772
You have connections to the council and with the
money that you've given her, she lords over many

03:48:28.772 --> 03:48:31.428
of the children of the various nobles.

03:48:31.428 --> 03:48:35.325
TALIESIN: I would have recommended my tutor, but
of course, Vax slit his throat right about the

03:48:35.325 --> 03:48:38.472
time you met him. He was a good tutor before
that.

03:48:38.472 --> 03:48:44.795
SAM: I don't know but we'll wait until we get to
Ashley to find out how things are going with our

03:48:44.795 --> 03:48:53.010
dating. Otherwise, in my free time, I would love
to use my time to write down the epic stories of

03:48:53.010 --> 03:49:00.243
Vox Machina, from our meeting to saving the world
and everything in between. It will be difficult as

03:49:00.243 --> 03:49:07.277
Scanlan is not an author, but he will rely on
guidance from Ioun herself and may even ask Sprigg

03:49:07.277 --> 03:49:17.143
to be a copy-editor of sorts. The working title is
"In the Belly of Dragons: The Legend of Scanlan

03:49:17.143 --> 03:49:20.583
"Shorthalt and Vox Machina". Working title.

03:49:20.583 --> 03:49:23.736
TRAVIS: "In the Anus of Dragons," accurately.

03:49:23.736 --> 03:49:29.894
SAM: And I hope to finish the book by the time I
turn 71.

03:49:29.894 --> 03:49:33.386
TRAVIS: How old are you, exactly?

03:49:33.386 --> 03:49:38.192
SAM: Oh, I'd be 70. When we started, I was 69.

03:49:38.192 --> 03:49:40.951
LAURA: You were &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; young?

03:49:40.951 --> 03:49:42.407
SAM: Yeah.

03:49:42.407 --> 03:49:44.366
LAURA: You motherfucker!

03:49:44.366 --> 03:49:46.171
TALIESIN: You're full of shit.

03:49:46.171 --> 03:49:48.619
LAURA: Oh my god, I can't believe you were that
young.

03:49:48.619 --> 03:49:50.392
TRAVIS: This whole time?

03:49:50.392 --> 03:49:55.349
LAURA: I thought you were 300 years old. Jesus.

03:49:55.349 --> 03:49:56.932
TALIESIN: Just full of shit.

03:49:56.932 --> 03:50:11.885
SAM: I mean, that's about it. I think every once
in a while, I would maybe try to see if I could see

03:50:11.885 --> 03:50:17.511
Vax or check in on him somehow, but I don't know
how other than to scry.

03:50:17.567 --> 03:50:22.860
MATT: Which does not succeed, but you still send
your thoughts and wishes into the ether in hopes

03:50:22.860 --> 03:50:27.027
that they find their way there. Okay.

03:50:27.027 --> 03:50:34.525
MATT: So following off that, the story of Taryon
Darrington, which I have something written for

03:50:34.525 --> 03:50:42.761
here based off what he did. Feel free to embellish
or change how you see fit. As the months pass, the

03:50:42.761 --> 03:50:48.187
Darrington family has adjusted somewhat to a more
humble lifestyle, and their work of charity

03:50:48.187 --> 03:50:54.546
within the city of Deastok and the neighboring
lands goes far to clean up the family name from

03:50:54.546 --> 03:50:57.892
where it once was. While their influence was greatly
diminished and they're essentially a political

03:50:57.892 --> 03:51:03.407
laughingstock, the message of their work still
strikes a chord in some of the more philanthropic

03:51:03.407 --> 03:51:10.007
lords to the north and an alliance is made that
protects the Darrington name and interests from

03:51:10.007 --> 03:51:19.846
the Myriad's ever wiley grasp for the time being.
Doty 3.0 now stands a shining golden color, gifted

03:51:19.846 --> 03:51:24.769
the materials by a thankful ore baron whom
Taryon's Brigade of Adventurers saved from a

03:51:24.769 --> 03:51:30.248
terrifying doppelgänger's plot. His troupe
continues to gain a small bit of notoriety in the

03:51:30.248 --> 03:51:36.759
southern lands of the Dwendalian Empire, some
good, some humorous. His mother, Mariya, ever

03:51:36.759 --> 03:51:42.995
cheering them on and making their tabards for
years before passing away peacefully, proud of her

03:51:42.995 --> 03:51:49.560
boy. Her passing brings the rest of the family
closer together than it's ever been. And the

03:51:49.560 --> 03:51:54.761
charitable efforts, surprisingly, of Howaardt now
encompass the Darrington Brigade as a

03:51:54.761 --> 03:52:03.839
non-profit adventuring league. During a gambling run
in Port Demali to follow, Taryon stumbles upon a

03:52:03.839 --> 03:52:12.180
now slightly more haggard Lawrence, now working as
a tanner. They immediately fell right back where

03:52:12.180 --> 03:52:20.488
they left off and Lawrence cashed in his life as a
leather worker to join the Brigade alongside Taryon.

03:52:20.488 --> 03:52:23.609
LAURA: Oh! That's so great!

03:52:23.609 --> 03:52:25.490
SAM: I love it!

03:52:25.490 --> 03:52:28.193
MATT: Anything you wish to add to that?

03:52:28.193 --> 03:52:38.087
SAM: No, I had written a letter, but yours is much
better. Yeah, that's great.

03:52:38.087 --> 03:52:40.672
LAURA: You wrote a letter?

03:52:40.672 --> 03:52:43.180
SAM: I didn't know how much Matt was going to
put.

03:52:43.180 --> 03:52:44.725
MATT: You could still read the letter.

03:52:44.725 --> 03:52:45.975
SAM: I can read the end of the letter.

03:52:45.975 --> 03:52:47.248
MATT: Okay.

03:52:47.248 --> 03:52:50.317
MARISHA: Oh, Sam.

03:52:50.317 --> 03:52:57.806
SAM: No, it's fine. You did good.

03:52:57.806 --> 03:53:02.684
MATT: I didn't mean to step on anything
you did.

03:53:02.684 --> 03:53:06.514
SAM: No, you did great. Much better.

03:53:06.514 --> 03:53:15.960
MATT: Pike. Wilhand spends his twilight years
helping with small tasks around the emerging House

03:53:15.960 --> 03:53:23.791
of the Everlight as it is built on the northern
edge of Westruun before age finally takes him in

03:53:23.791 --> 03:53:29.545
peace amongst friends and family. The red-brick
house you grew up in and Grog grew along with you

03:53:29.545 --> 03:53:36.276
for a while is left in your name and there you
know you have ever a homestead in Westruun in

03:53:36.276 --> 03:53:40.459
memory of Wilhand and the friendships you forged.
What else would you like to do? What else do

03:53:40.459 --> 03:53:52.783
you wish to achieve, Pike, as the years go on?
That could pertain to you and whatever

03:53:52.783 --> 03:53:55.418
relationship with Scanlan you wish to embellish
on.

03:53:55.418 --> 03:53:57.633
SAM: Should we roll for dating?

03:53:57.633 --> 03:53:59.878
(laughter)

03:53:59.878 --> 03:54:03.303
MATT: There's a chart somewhere in second
edition.

03:54:03.303 --> 03:54:14.231
ASHLEY: I don't know what Grog's plans are, but I
do know if there were any adventuring to be had,

03:54:14.231 --> 03:54:21.317
that her and Grog got to on some adventures
together.

03:54:21.317 --> 03:54:23.055
TRAVIS: Yeah!

03:54:23.055 --> 03:54:33.031
ASHLEY: And that he always has a place in my home
and I know I would love to-- I'm sure at this

03:54:33.031 --> 03:54:56.895
point, fully rebuild the temple in Vasselheim. I
think things have gone well with Scanlan. Oh man,

03:54:56.895 --> 03:54:58.386
I'm getting so emotional.

03:54:58.386 --> 03:55:01.287
SAM: Like second-base well or even better than
that?

03:55:01.287 --> 03:55:12.256
ASHLEY: Well, I think if we spend enough time
together, maybe, I don't know, can we see what

03:55:12.256 --> 03:55:16.158
else life has for us together?

03:55:16.158 --> 03:55:19.916
SAM: Absolutely.

03:55:19.916 --> 03:55:24.760
ASHLEY: That doesn't have to mean anything more. I
know your life, what you like to do and I'll give

03:55:24.760 --> 03:55:26.074
you freedom.

03:55:26.074 --> 03:55:35.264
SAM: No, I think the most free I've ever been is
with you.

03:55:35.264 --> 03:55:48.814
ASHLEY: I think there's no one I would rather
spend the rest of my days with, besides my pal Grog.

03:55:48.814 --> 03:55:51.267
I think you get a two-for-one deal!

03:55:51.267 --> 03:55:54.280
SAM: Sure. The weird family dynamic.

03:55:54.280 --> 03:55:58.532
TRAVIS: You guys keep it quiet up there, please?

03:55:58.532 --> 03:56:06.251
SAM: Weird roommates. Giant lower floor, tiny
upper floor.

03:56:06.251 --> 03:56:10.201
LIAM: The ceiling is one inch above your head.

03:56:10.201 --> 03:56:25.113
ASHLEY: I think at some point, I ask Scanlan for
his hand in marriage.

03:56:25.113 --> 03:56:32.424
SAM: I mean, I would have to ask Wilhand for his
permission.

03:56:32.424 --> 03:56:34.375
MATT: He passed away.

03:56:34.375 --> 03:56:38.101
SAM: Well then, I would go leave some flowers at
the grave.

03:56:38.101 --> 03:56:41.749
TRAVIS: You can ask me.

03:56:41.749 --> 03:56:56.761
SAM: Oh, I will ask Grog for permission. Grog, as
the father figure in our weird household, I would

03:56:56.761 --> 03:57:04.308
like to ask for your permission to wed your
not-daughter, Pike, who is much smarter and older

03:57:04.308 --> 03:57:06.229
than you.

03:57:06.229 --> 03:57:11.179
TRAVIS: You're a scoundrel. Do you have any
money?

03:57:11.179 --> 03:57:14.658
SAM: I have this little black rock that you gave
me.

03:57:14.658 --> 03:57:24.986
TRAVIS: That's worth literally nothing. How about
you give her this? And I take out the rare black

03:57:24.986 --> 03:57:29.094
sapphire and put it in your hand.

03:57:29.094 --> 03:57:31.871
SAM: That's pretty good.

03:57:31.871 --> 03:57:36.548
TRAVIS: I'm fucking watching you, you understand?

03:57:36.548 --> 03:57:40.117
SAM: I won't hurt her, I promise.

03:57:40.117 --> 03:57:41.256
TRAVIS: Don't you slip up!

03:57:41.256 --> 03:57:43.045
SAM: Nope, I know you could kill me in my sleep.

03:57:43.045 --> 03:57:47.939
TRAVIS: I know. I usually put dead people in the
bag of holding, but there's always a first! Treat

03:57:47.939 --> 03:57:48.992
her right.

03:57:48.992 --> 03:57:52.512
SAM: Would you walk me down the aisle and by walk
me down the aisle, I mean carry me down the aisle?

03:57:52.512 --> 03:57:59.998
(laughter)

03:57:59.998 --> 03:58:02.477
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Yes.

03:58:02.477 --> 03:58:05.891
SAM: All right, let's have a group weird hug.

03:58:05.891 --> 03:58:14.623
MATT: Aw. All righty. Anything else, Pike? Are you
happy with that?

03:58:14.623 --> 03:58:16.724
SAM: Do I have to convert, Pike?

03:58:16.724 --> 03:58:18.722
ASHLEY: What's that?

03:58:18.722 --> 03:58:21.249
SAM: Do I have to convert? I'm an Iounian.

03:58:21.249 --> 03:58:22.227
ASHLEY: No.

03:58:22.227 --> 03:58:23.308
SAM: Okay, I'm good.

03:58:23.308 --> 03:58:26.357
LAURA: You're Iounish?

03:58:26.357 --> 03:58:28.878
ASHLEY: Sarenrae's very accepting of other gods.

03:58:28.878 --> 03:58:31.192
SAM: Multi-faith ceremony. There you go.

03:58:31.192 --> 03:58:34.973
MARISHA: 16 rites of passage.

03:58:34.973 --> 03:58:36.793
MATT: Anything else, Pike?

03:58:36.793 --> 03:58:39.116
ASHLEY: No.

03:58:39.116 --> 03:58:50.316
MATT: Okay. All right, we'll leave it at that.
Percival. Vex'ahlia. Since your fates are rather

03:58:50.316 --> 03:58:53.427
intertwined, I ask you both what are your plans,
what are your plots?

03:58:53.427 --> 03:58:57.158
TALIESIN: I don't really think we should settle
down. That seems like a lot.

03:58:57.158 --> 03:58:59.231
LAURA: (laughs)

03:58:59.231 --> 03:59:08.440
TALIESIN: I think that I would like to start a
very complicated art project that's going to take

03:59:08.440 --> 03:59:14.461
many years. I'm not going to work on it all the
time, day and night, but I'm going to invest some

03:59:14.461 --> 03:59:16.081
time in this.

03:59:16.081 --> 03:59:17.743
LAURA: Are you going to be in your shop a lot?

03:59:17.743 --> 03:59:27.090
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to build a clocktower.
Like the one in Prague. I'm going to take many

03:59:27.132 --> 03:59:30.730
years and it's going to sit at the front of the
castle so it will be outside and there will be

03:59:30.730 --> 03:59:43.608
other people working on it. It will, as a proper
clock does, it will tell our story. Once a year,

03:59:43.608 --> 03:59:47.199
everything will play out.

03:59:47.199 --> 03:59:50.157
LAURA: Holy shit. That's good.

03:59:50.157 --> 03:59:58.481
TALIESIN: And we may start inviting tinkering
artisans every year for Whitestone to come show

03:59:58.481 --> 04:00:09.160
off things that are not necessarily useful, but to
show off fanciful inventions and things that are

04:00:09.160 --> 04:00:10.924
beautiful.

04:00:10.924 --> 04:00:12.554
LAURA: I love that idea.

04:00:12.554 --> 04:00:14.147
TALIESIN: But let's not stay here too often.

04:00:14.147 --> 04:00:15.398
(laughter)

04:00:15.398 --> 04:00:21.572
LAURA: No, although we will have to stay here for
nine months every once in a while, because I think

04:00:21.572 --> 04:00:23.901
we should rebuild the families that we've lost.

04:00:23.901 --> 04:00:26.205
TALIESIN: There's a lot of names.

04:00:26.205 --> 04:00:28.482
LAURA and TALIESIN: So many names.

04:00:28.482 --> 04:00:30.665
MATT: How many names?

04:00:30.665 --> 04:00:33.237
TALIESIN: So many ways to irritate your father.

04:00:33.237 --> 04:00:34.471
LAURA: Five names.

04:00:34.471 --> 04:00:35.857
TALIESIN: Oh, at the very least.

04:00:35.857 --> 04:00:36.960
LAURA: Five.

04:00:36.960 --> 04:00:41.240
MARISHA: That's a lot of names. Very long names.

04:00:41.240 --> 04:00:43.278
LIAM: At least three sets of twins.

04:00:43.278 --> 04:00:45.779
(laughter)

04:00:45.779 --> 04:00:47.498
TALIESIN: Jesus.

04:00:47.498 --> 04:00:53.429
LAURA: I definitely want to build a statue to
Trinket, the wonder bear.

04:00:53.429 --> 04:00:55.618
MARISHA: The wonder bear.

04:00:55.618 --> 04:00:56.956
SAM: Is he dead?

04:00:56.956 --> 04:00:58.545
LAURA: No, Trinket's around.

04:00:58.545 --> 04:00:59.787
SAM: Damn it.

04:00:59.787 --> 04:01:05.187
LAURA: So centuries of people in Whitestone will
remember their mascot, Trinket.

04:01:05.187 --> 04:01:06.868
MARISHA: He prevents forest fires.

04:01:06.868 --> 04:01:10.826
(laughter)

04:01:10.826 --> 04:01:12.125
TRAVIS: Ranger's hat.

04:01:12.125 --> 04:01:16.299
LAURA: As the years pass, we should start a
festival and bears will be everywhere.

04:01:16.299 --> 04:01:19.652
TALIESIN: There will be. Bears will be involved in
the festival. Obviously. Especially since the

04:01:19.652 --> 04:01:23.829
clock tower is part of the festival and bears
feature heavily in it.

04:01:23.829 --> 04:01:24.840
LAURA: Perfect.

04:01:24.840 --> 04:01:27.136
TRAVIS: Only you can prevent forest fires.

04:01:27.136 --> 04:01:30.148
TALIESIN: Only you can prevent the rise of Vecna.

04:01:30.148 --> 04:01:33.316
(laughter)

04:01:33.316 --> 04:01:47.060
LAURA: I was hoping to never stop attempting to
contact Vax through the temple of the Raven Queen.

04:01:47.060 --> 04:01:54.209
MATT: You do notice that the raven population of
Whitestone seems to be perpetually seeing blooms

04:01:54.209 --> 04:01:57.354
every year, far more than it used to.

04:01:57.354 --> 04:02:02.776
LAURA: I cast Speak with Animals on them and I
constantly try to communicate with him.

04:02:02.776 --> 04:02:10.893
MATT: Okay, I mean they all seem to be ravens
happy to live in this space, but it seems to be

04:02:10.893 --> 04:02:15.316
more in essence the vicinity more than a specific
raven.

04:02:15.316 --> 04:02:24.876
LAURA: Would you be all right if we increased the
Pelor temple here?

04:02:24.876 --> 04:02:36.285
TALIESIN: Yes, I trust your judgment. It
is not for me, but I'm definitely all right

04:02:36.285 --> 04:02:38.069
with anything that makes you happy.

04:02:38.069 --> 04:02:39.960
LAURA: Thank you, darling.

04:02:39.960 --> 04:02:43.048
TALIESIN: To be fair, you'd do it anyway.

04:02:43.048 --> 04:02:45.890
LAURA: Pretty much, yeah.

04:02:45.890 --> 04:02:52.644
TALIESIN: I help Cassandra as best I can. I think
at least once a year we get out and do something

04:02:52.644 --> 04:02:54.170
irresponsible.

04:02:54.170 --> 04:02:55.026
LAURA: Definitely.

04:02:55.026 --> 04:03:00.501
TALIESIN: Maybe sometimes drag these kids out for
shenanigans.

04:03:00.501 --> 04:03:10.291
MATT: Cassandra, as a note by the way. She's had a
few pretty difficult brushes with death and the

04:03:10.291 --> 04:03:15.512
experiences definitely left a mark on her.
Within the year following the battle with Vecna,

04:03:15.512 --> 04:03:25.132
she begins to remind you of yourself at a very
dark time. Recognizing that, you come to her and

04:03:25.132 --> 04:03:34.707
help pull her from a dangerous edge of lashing out
at the place she's worked so hard to build. You

04:03:34.707 --> 04:03:41.810
help her realize that this guilt she's been
holding as being a tool of manipulation the times

04:03:41.810 --> 04:03:47.892
that she has been is not her fault and used
against the ones she loves. In that determination

04:03:47.892 --> 04:03:56.832
to no longer be a tool for others to use, she asks
Vex to teach her and train her. To not just be the

04:03:56.832 --> 04:04:02.561
lady beacon of Whitestone, but also join in as one
of its protectors.

04:04:02.561 --> 04:04:06.051
LAURA: At least she had some good promise a long
time ago.

04:04:06.051 --> 04:04:15.426
MATT: "That was some time, but I've seen what you
can do and, well, I deign to think of how dangerous

04:04:15.426 --> 04:04:18.592
"the three of us would be if I could reach your
level."

04:04:18.592 --> 04:04:20.416
LAURA: We'll make you strong, darling.

04:04:20.416 --> 04:04:24.991
TALIESIN: We also insist that she leave Whitestone
at least once a year for a period of time to do

04:04:24.991 --> 04:04:26.313
fuck all.

04:04:26.313 --> 04:04:30.279
LAURA: Yeah, there's a beautiful place called
Dalen's Closet. I think you would love it.

04:04:30.279 --> 04:04:34.300
TALIESIN: Let's not, well yes, there's, well.

04:04:34.300 --> 04:04:40.807
MATT: Anything else? You guys happy with that?

04:04:40.807 --> 04:04:48.048
TALIESIN: I'm content to make a clock tower and
make art and never make another weapon. I'm good.

04:04:48.048 --> 04:04:51.764
MATT: Hmm, all right.

04:04:51.764 --> 04:04:58.081
LAURA: I have "Make Whitestone the tits," written
in my notes of things that I want to do.

04:04:58.081 --> 04:05:03.653
TALIESIN: It's got a bear. I'm imagining the bear
from Burning Man actually.

04:05:03.653 --> 04:05:05.383
MARISHA: Penny Bear.

04:05:05.383 --> 04:05:07.430
LAURA: Yeah, Penny Bear. I like it.

04:05:07.430 --> 04:05:11.277
MATT: There you go. Grog.

04:05:11.277 --> 04:05:24.161
TRAVIS: I'm so fascinated by Vasselheim. I have so
many interests that I feel it only proper to go

04:05:24.161 --> 04:05:37.393
back and turn myself in to the authorities for
punching one of the guards in the face and take

04:05:37.393 --> 04:05:40.884
whatever punishment they have for me.

04:05:40.884 --> 04:05:48.094
MATT: All right, as you head back to the district
in which these incursions happened, you are

04:05:48.094 --> 04:05:57.374
immediately recognized and much to their
completely taken aback reaction they bring you in

04:05:57.374 --> 04:06:02.478
until somebody of the higher Bastions goes, "You
fools. This is one of Vox Machina. What's wrong

04:06:02.478 --> 04:06:09.912
"with you?" "Oh I didn't--" And they all point up
at the large titan which is--

04:06:09.912 --> 04:06:12.862
TRAVIS: Yeah, up top, that's where we were.

04:06:12.862 --> 04:06:17.504
MATT: Which currently has been cleared out of any
cursed undead that they know of. It's a process

04:06:17.504 --> 04:06:22.748
that takes a while, but it becomes a monument to
that battle and it becomes converted into a symbol

04:06:22.748 --> 04:06:30.526
of hope for the city. For generations to come in
Vasselheim, that titan will stand there, lording

04:06:30.526 --> 04:06:34.078
over the city, as a reminder of what transpired,
of what could have been lost, and what was saved

04:06:34.078 --> 04:06:37.735
that day in memory of those that were lost. And as
you point up to that and they all realize, they

04:06:37.735 --> 04:06:40.857
slowly remove your shackles.

04:06:40.857 --> 04:06:44.770
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm free to go?

04:06:44.770 --> 04:06:47.533
MATT: "Yes, sir. Thank you, thank you."

04:06:47.533 --> 04:06:59.456
TRAVIS: That's unexpected. Could you point me in
the direction of a library?

04:06:59.456 --> 04:07:07.779
MATT: "Sure, come with me." As you begin to walk
out you watch as a familiar figure steps up to

04:07:07.779 --> 04:07:18.476
this portion of the Bastions' guard post, you see a
familiar merchant who rushes up and goes, "I was

04:07:18.476 --> 04:07:23.778
"being summoned. They found the-- why's he walking
free?"

04:07:23.778 --> 04:07:28.867
TRAVIS: Yes. You. You will come with me.

04:07:28.867 --> 04:07:34.662
MATT: "Gentlemen, this is the man who punched me.
This is the man who ruined my business. I can--"

04:07:34.662 --> 04:07:44.399
TRAVIS: Gentlemen, whose word are you going to
take? The savior of Vasselheim, or his new tutor?

04:07:44.399 --> 04:07:47.810
MATT: "What?"

04:07:47.810 --> 04:07:50.163
(laughter)

04:07:50.163 --> 04:07:56.952
MATT: The guards go, "Cobalt Reserve library
station is down that way to the left. Hard to miss,

04:07:56.952 --> 04:08:02.683
"big blue dome. You two work this out." And they
retract back into the guard post, leaving the two

04:08:02.683 --> 04:08:04.220
of you in the street.

04:08:04.220 --> 04:08:11.306
TRAVIS: Well, unless you have something better to
do, you could contribute to one of the greatest

04:08:11.306 --> 04:08:16.088
people to ever pass through this city and help me
learn to read a little bit more. Would that be a

04:08:16.088 --> 04:08:20.431
problem? I only have 8,000 gold to give you.

04:08:20.431 --> 04:08:22.453
MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage.

04:08:22.453 --> 04:08:24.194
SAM: 8,000 gold.

04:08:24.194 --> 04:08:25.527
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

04:08:25.527 --> 04:08:28.358
(cheering)

04:08:28.358 --> 04:08:31.948
MATT: (laughter) Didn't even need the advantage.
All right.

04:08:31.948 --> 04:08:33.823
SAM: 8,000 gold.

04:08:33.823 --> 04:08:40.961
MATT: "Well, that would certainly go far for
reparations for the damage you've caused to both

04:08:40.961 --> 04:08:43.268
"my business, my person and my psyche."

04:08:43.268 --> 04:08:47.120
(laughter)

04:08:47.120 --> 04:08:54.944
MATT: "But I'm curious to see what this change of
heart is, so sure. But you're going to pay upfront."

04:08:54.944 --> 04:08:56.986
TRAVIS: Yes, 8,000 gold.

04:08:56.986 --> 04:09:00.110
MATT: "Holy shit."

04:09:00.110 --> 04:09:01.979
TRAVIS: I could carry it if you want.

04:09:01.979 --> 04:09:04.952
MATT: "We'll just make a quick stop over by my
shop, please."

04:09:04.952 --> 04:09:06.061
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

04:09:06.061 --> 04:09:10.364
MATT: And he drags it and it leaves this big heavy
groove in the ground as he pulls it along. "Nope,

04:09:10.364 --> 04:09:15.727
"nope, it's good, I got it" (struggling noises) And
leads you to the Cobalt Reserve and for as long as

04:09:15.727 --> 04:09:18.876
you'll have him he'll begin to tutor you.

04:09:18.876 --> 04:09:24.460
TRAVIS: I'd like to learn to read a bit more. I'd
like to split some time in the temple of Kord.

04:09:24.460 --> 04:09:29.945
MATT: Which takes a while to get rebuilt and you
probably help out a bit, too, Earthbreaker Groon,

04:09:29.945 --> 04:09:33.064
who survived, though many of his--

04:09:33.064 --> 04:09:34.759
TRAVIS: Oh, he did survive.

04:09:34.759 --> 04:09:37.582
MATT: He did survive, yeah. He's made of hardier
stuff.

04:09:37.582 --> 04:09:41.997
TRAVIS: I'd also like to bring Pike out every once
in a while and we give challengers a shot in the

04:09:41.997 --> 04:09:50.525
Crucible, but mostly I'm trying to improve my mind
and looking for the next challenge.

04:09:50.525 --> 04:09:52.895
MATT: I like it.

04:09:52.895 --> 04:09:54.564
LIAM: Bring him up to eight intelligence.

04:09:54.564 --> 04:09:55.715
LAURA: Yeah.

04:09:55.715 --> 04:09:57.342
TRAVIS: Seven's a good start.

04:09:57.342 --> 04:09:59.602
(laughter)

04:09:59.602 --> 04:10:01.426
MATT: Perfect. Happy with that?

04:10:01.426 --> 04:10:02.429
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:10:02.429 --> 04:10:06.375
MATT: Okay, then. Keyleth.

04:10:06.375 --> 04:10:17.948
MARISHA: (sighs) Okay. Naturally, help Pike
rebuild Vasselheim in the most immediate of

04:10:17.948 --> 04:10:34.305
circumstances. Eventually retire to Zephra. Go be
the actual leader of my people. Continue to get in

04:10:34.305 --> 04:10:43.902
any type of frays that these people invite me on
as it reminds me of the good old days and keeps my

04:10:43.902 --> 04:10:53.408
promise to protect this realm any time this realm
needs protecting. And I find Kerrick at some

04:10:53.408 --> 04:11:01.590
point. Seek out Kerrick. Make sure he's okay.
Reconnect with him, have coffee, you know.

04:11:01.590 --> 04:11:05.442
MATT: Yeah. He's a quick jaunt from Zephra,
thankfully. Westruun's not that far. That's one of

04:11:05.442 --> 04:11:07.313
the closer large cities outside of Stillben.

04:11:07.313 --> 04:11:09.229
MARISHA: Perfect. We're weekend buddies.

04:11:09.229 --> 04:11:10.748
MATT: (laughs)

04:11:10.748 --> 04:11:23.248
MARISHA: We go to wine country. And then I work on
the propagated sprig from the Sun Tree and

04:11:23.248 --> 04:11:34.129
continue to build it out, hopefully on the ley
lines of the planet, and I take the feather that

04:11:34.129 --> 04:11:48.029
Pike gave me from Vax and I embed it into the
trunk of the tree as well as any other relics from

04:11:48.029 --> 04:11:54.827
the Raven Queen I can find. Care for ravens as
much as I can.

04:11:54.827 --> 04:12:04.301
MATT: There is an uptick of ravens in the space of
Zephra as well. Not many, but more than there would

04:12:04.301 --> 04:12:05.848
be, which is usually zero.

04:12:05.848 --> 04:12:20.085
MARISHA: And from the branch of the Sun Tree
create my own raven tree of the Ashari. Take a

04:12:20.085 --> 04:12:28.815
long, long, long, long, long time before I maybe
date again. Maybe. But eventually, hopefully,

04:12:28.815 --> 04:12:39.978
after a long, long, long, long, long time sunset
into the tree and become a part of this realm.

04:12:39.978 --> 04:12:44.588
MATT: That's a ways off for you, Ms. Archdruid.

04:12:44.588 --> 04:12:46.108
MARISHA: Ways off.

04:12:46.157 --> 04:12:48.069
MATT: But you begin those preparations.

04:12:48.069 --> 04:12:49.612
MARISHA: But that's the plan.

04:12:49.612 --> 04:12:56.976
MATT: Okay. Well you, Keyleth, who many only once
saw the naive druid girl have a level of respect

04:12:56.976 --> 04:13:02.585
now that's carried with that mantle that you hold.
And the council of Tal'Dorei occasionally calls

04:13:02.585 --> 04:13:08.015
upon your wisdom and guidance. The alliance
between the civilised and the natured world of the

04:13:08.015 --> 04:13:13.339
lands irrevocably in Tal'Dorei bound to you at
this point, between you and the earth Ashari who

04:13:13.339 --> 04:13:20.568
reside up in the Cliffkeep. Between occasional
jaunts to Emon and Whitestone, you find renewed

04:13:20.568 --> 04:13:23.324
joy in the protection of the people there.

04:13:23.324 --> 04:13:34.050
One cold Cuersaar the 13th, the tenth month of
the year, the cool summer dusk day closes and you

04:13:34.050 --> 04:13:41.270
emerge from the quarters to find that the winds
come and blow through your hair. You step out to

04:13:41.270 --> 04:13:49.103
the sound of children laughing as a dozen Ashari
kids, elf, dwarf, orc, many bloods and creeds rush

04:13:49.103 --> 04:13:56.091
past as they play. It's a familiar sound. It's a
happy sound. You glance over at this village

04:13:56.091 --> 04:14:04.880
you're protecting and the people that truly look
up to you as their leader, both not just from a

04:14:04.880 --> 04:14:14.794
might source but as a guide. And you look to them
to teach you things every day as well. Looking

04:14:14.794 --> 04:14:20.071
past as the sun begins to set, you see Korrin
standing by the cherry blossom at the edge of the

04:14:20.071 --> 04:14:28.965
cliff near the amphitheatre where you had your
ceremony. In pinks and oranges and purples, the

04:14:28.965 --> 04:14:37.302
sunset takes the sky. As you approach, he still
looks out. He's older, not too much older but older.

04:14:37.302 --> 04:14:50.031
As he notices you approach, he looks over. "In all
my years, not a day passes where awe does not

04:14:50.031 --> 04:15:01.819
"strike me at the beauty of this world." He looks
over towards the sunset. "Don't ever lose the

04:15:01.819 --> 04:15:13.014
"memory of every face whose strength helped you
keep this light from fading. Every single face."

04:15:13.014 --> 04:15:30.009
MARISHA: I don't think it's the faces that keep
this light from fading. I think it is what it is.

04:15:30.009 --> 04:15:48.241
We're lucky to experience it, a few are lucky to
think it's beautiful. You taught me that. I don't

04:15:48.241 --> 04:15:59.101
have to appreciate this. Especially not after what
I've seen. But I do.

04:15:59.101 --> 04:16:01.531
MATT: "You need to."

04:16:01.531 --> 04:16:07.314
MARISHA: Only because of what I've seen.

04:16:07.314 --> 04:16:16.318
MATT: And you see a bit of heartbreak but he nods
his head and reaches out and takes you in, holds

04:16:16.318 --> 04:16:24.481
you there on the cliff side, the winds just being
kept at bay. "I'm proud of you."

04:16:24.481 --> 04:16:46.847
MARISHA: Thank you. It's all I ever wanted. It's
weird, once you reach a life goal and then realize

04:16:46.847 --> 04:17:07.693
you have the rest of your life. I guess I just
find new goals. Sometimes it's hard being a

04:17:07.693 --> 04:17:18.431
prodigy because then you just grow up to be a
regular adult.

04:17:18.431 --> 04:17:31.212
MATT: He pulls you in tighter. "You'll always be
my girl. My little Keyleth."

04:17:31.212 --> 04:17:34.210
MARISHA: Thanks, Dad.

04:17:34.210 --> 04:17:35.708
MATT: "I love you."

04:17:35.708 --> 04:17:37.509
MARISHA: I love you.

04:17:37.509 --> 04:17:46.982
MATT: (sighs) "Anyway, I should get to seeing if
dinner preparations are being made. Looks to be a

04:17:46.982 --> 04:17:53.031
"cold night." He tugs your hand and walks back,
leaves you there on the cliff side looking out. As

04:17:53.031 --> 04:18:02.482
the sunlight slowly blinks away over the horizon,
leaving you with the purples and blues of the

04:18:02.482 --> 04:18:12.057
night sky as the stars begin to glitter up, you
can hear a raven caw catch your ear as you glance

04:18:12.057 --> 04:18:19.026
up into the branches of the cherry blossom tree.
There's just one raven.

04:18:19.026 --> 04:18:21.755
MARISHA: Blow a kiss.

04:18:21.755 --> 04:18:30.799
MATT: Flies down, lands on your shoulder. It's a
bigger raven than any you've seen before. You've

04:18:30.799 --> 04:18:33.514
not seen this raven around.

04:18:33.514 --> 04:18:35.688
MARISHA: Little scratch.

04:18:35.688 --> 04:18:39.859
MATT: It leans into it.

04:18:39.859 --> 04:18:46.648
And every day that raven comes to visit.

04:18:46.648 --> 04:18:54.569
And that's where we're going to close the campaign.

04:18:54.569 --> 04:18:58.754
SAM: What a nice story.

04:18:58.754 --> 04:19:00.670
LAURA: Wow.

04:19:00.670 --> 04:19:02.247
TRAVIS: Let's do it again.

04:19:02.247 --> 04:19:04.334
(laughter)

04:19:04.334 --> 04:19:05.843
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

04:19:05.843 --> 04:19:17.200
MATT: Oh, wow. When this chapter closes, a whole
new one, a whole new one opens very soon. (sighs)

04:19:17.200 --> 04:19:22.675
We'll be back in the new year with a new story to
tell and in the meantime we'll be playing games

04:19:22.675 --> 04:19:29.298
here and mixing it up. Being silly. A few other
faces are going to take up the storytelling mantle

04:19:29.298 --> 04:19:33.056
here. Me and Marisha have a wedding in a little
over a week.

04:19:33.056 --> 04:19:40.413
MARISHA: Oh god. I had to get past this emotional
chapter so I could get through the next one.

04:19:40.413 --> 04:19:42.540
(laughter)

04:19:42.540 --> 04:19:49.292
MATT: But here we are at the end of this
near-five-year journey for us and near-three-year

04:19:49.292 --> 04:19:55.237
journey with all of you and I just want to
appreciate having, honestly, some of the best

04:19:55.237 --> 04:20:00.516
friends and players I could ever hope for to come
along on this journey, to trust me enough to build

04:20:00.516 --> 04:20:04.364
this with you and to give back so much more than I
could have ever hoped.

04:20:04.364 --> 04:20:06.166
LIAM: Thank you, Matt.

04:20:06.166 --> 04:20:07.667
LAURA: Thank you.

04:20:07.667 --> 04:20:09.530
MARISHA: Best DM ever.

04:20:09.530 --> 04:20:14.025
MATT: You guys make it all easy and worthwhile.

04:20:14.025 --> 04:20:15.746
LAURA: Oh fuck.

04:20:15.746 --> 04:20:17.443
MATT: Love you guys.

04:20:17.443 --> 04:20:21.773
LAURA: Shit. Yay!

04:20:21.773 --> 04:20:27.539
MATT: And love you guys, each and every one of you
out there who've come with us on this journey;

04:20:27.539 --> 04:20:32.490
new, old, for just a bit, or the entire length,
some of you multiple times. Thank you for joining

04:20:32.490 --> 04:20:49.485
in on whatever this weird little magical, curious
experience has, and will continue to be. Promise

04:20:49.485 --> 04:20:52.110
me you'll be good.

04:20:52.110 --> 04:20:53.296
MARISHA: We'll be back.

04:20:53.296 --> 04:20:54.603
LAURA: Yeah, we'll be back.

04:20:54.603 --> 04:20:58.393
LIAM: We might look a little different, but we're
still going to be here.

04:20:58.393 --> 04:20:59.816
MATT: Yep!

04:20:59.816 --> 04:21:03.115
LAURA: That was a really pretty sendoff, Matt.
Thank you.

04:21:03.115 --> 04:21:04.698
MARISHA: That was beautiful.

04:21:04.698 --> 04:21:08.016
SAM: Thanks, Matt. That was really nice.

04:21:08.016 --> 04:21:11.444
MATT: Love you, guys.

04:21:11.444 --> 04:21:13.447
LAURA: Love you, Matthew.

04:21:13.447 --> 04:21:25.581
MATT: Love you, guys. Have a wonderful night. Rest
well. And is it Thursday yet?
