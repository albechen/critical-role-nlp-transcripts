00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:08.733
SAM: Hey, everybody! It's me, Sam Riegel! Welcome
to Not Critical Role! I will be your host for the

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:14.651
evening and Dungeon Master. This is the first time
I've ever done this, so treat me nicely and

00:00:14.651 --> 00:00:20.741
gently. I will be guiding our players tonight
through some sort of convoluted story that I've

00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:28.123
come up with. My guests for this evening are
ferociously handsome and attractive people.

00:00:28.123 --> 00:00:37.829
Perhaps I can introduce them to you now. Over here
is cabbage-smelling Brian Foster. Next to him is

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.030
the fabulously talented and sultry Mary Elizabeth
McGlynn. Next to her is cute-as-a-button Ashly

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:55.781
Burch. Then my wife and yours, Liam O'Brien. Next
to him, playing his first ever game of Dungeons

00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:57.338
and Dragons--

00:00:57.338 --> 00:01:01.894
ERIC: I just got off my Uber shift, and I am
terrified right now.

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:08.665
SAM: This is Eric Bauza, man of a thousand voices.
He really doesn't know how to play at all, and

00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:10.978
didn't really practice.

00:01:10.978 --> 00:01:15.177
LIAM: He knows six percent less than you!

00:01:15.177 --> 00:01:20.613
SAM: Yeah, that's right! I will be asking for a
lot of help tonight from Liam O'Brien, as will Eric.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:25.426
LIAM: And I'll turn to the right and ask Matt--
he's not here.

00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:32.220
SAM: Matt and Marisha and the rest of the Critical
Role gang are on the playa in Burning Man right

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.799
now, so they can't be here. Naked. Humping each
other. So they can't be here tonight, but we're

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:45.839
going to carry on without them and have a one-shot
deal. We have some announcements before we go,

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:47.037
right, Liam?

00:01:47.037 --> 00:01:49.026
LIAM: Yeah, I got some, you got some.

00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:56.828
SAM: I'll start. First, new merch, guys! New merch
available in the store right now. This awesome

00:01:56.828 --> 00:02:06.557
shirt that says Dalen's Closet in Shamal Bay. It's
a little throwback to that little fun beach

00:02:06.557 --> 00:02:10.229
adventure we had with pranks and stuff. Ooh, it's
so soft.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.442
LIAM: If you think that sleeves are bullshit, we
have this one, as well.

00:02:14.442 --> 00:02:16.915
SAM: Wow, that's such a beachy shirt!

00:02:16.915 --> 00:02:21.542
ERIC: You get a great tan with that shirt.

00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:27.944
SAM: Wow, I love it! And it's available in the
store already? Now? Go purchase it! Go purchase

00:02:27.944 --> 00:02:29.429
the shirts.

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.637
BRIAN: I want to see Travis wear that when he
works out.

00:02:32.637 --> 00:02:37.734
LIAM: There's more stuff, though. Well, the Dagger
Dagger Dagger shirt is back. I know that's not

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:43.188
brand new, but it's new-ish. The Scanlan shirt is
even less new-ish, but it's an amazing shirt, and

00:02:43.188 --> 00:02:46.669
it's still there. We have the aprons still, we
have pencils, we have Tarot cards. I feel like

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:54.180
going: ooh. She's in the desert; she can't touch
me right now. That's it.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:01.869
SAM: So that's our merch update. Liam and I will
be tomorrow morning flying to Sacramento to do

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:03.503
SacAnime. Are you doing it, Mary?

00:03:03.503 --> 00:03:09.560
MARY: No, I have to do a red-eye on Friday night
to Dragon Con. Yes, very exciting, to meet Mr.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.771
Steve Blum there. I haven't met, I'm looking
forward to it.

00:03:13.771 --> 00:03:23.818
SAM: So we'll be in Sacramento for the weekend, me
and Liam, doing stuff. Come see us. Come say hi if

00:03:23.818 --> 00:03:32.671
you're in the northern central California
vicinity. Sure. Any other announcements, Liam?

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:37.682
LIAM: Yeah, we've got that art book coming out. If
you want to get updates you can go over to

00:03:37.682 --> 00:03:43.105
geekandsundry.com/artbook and sign up for updates,
and you'll get the latest. And then also,

00:03:43.105 --> 00:03:48.172
Taliesin's not here; he's also naked in the
desert, but on Wednesday he'll be back for

00:03:48.172 --> 00:03:53.525
Wednesday Club. In addition to everything they're
going to be talking about, there will be a little

00:03:53.525 --> 00:04:00.098
scuttlebutt about the Critical Role comic book. We
might show you the cover of the damn thing. Other

00:04:00.098 --> 00:04:02.778
things to announce about it, so tune in if you're
curious.

00:04:02.778 --> 00:04:06.392
BRIAN: There's Talks Machina Tuesday night.

00:04:06.392 --> 00:04:08.489
SAM: Oh Jesus, Brian, come on.

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:15.549
BRIAN: It's shameless self promotion at this
point. But no, it's great, actually, to be a part

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:21.772
of the show that I have been riding the coattails
of this past year. It's great to finally be a part

00:04:21.772 --> 00:04:27.662
of the actual show. Tuesday nights, Talks Machina.
I'll talk to you guys afterward about who's going

00:04:27.662 --> 00:04:32.772
to be on, and then we'll announce. So that's it,
7:00 on these very channels.

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.002
SAM: Eric, anything to plug?

00:04:35.002 --> 00:04:41.400
ERIC: DuckTales. That's how we do our thing. We're
on DuckTales together.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.156
LIAM: Yeah, he plays many characters.

00:04:43.156 --> 00:04:49.070
ERIC: Yes, actually, I think the 23rd may be the
introduction of the many characters.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:57.485
SAM: Oh is that true? September 23rd, tune in to
DuckTales. He played 30 characters in one episode?

00:04:57.485 --> 00:04:59.257
Something like that. It's a lot.

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:05.766
ERIC: I had to sing Happy Birthday 47 times. 47
different accents.

00:05:05.766 --> 00:05:07.803
SAM: Ash-boo, anything?

00:05:07.803 --> 00:05:13.333
ASHLY: I think you're great and you're going to do
a great job. Oh, OK K.O.!, which Mary's also on,

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:17.337
is out now on Cartoon Network. Are you on it,
Bauza?

00:05:17.337 --> 00:05:18.485
ERIC: No.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:23.438
(laughter)

00:05:23.438 --> 00:05:30.838
ERIC: I'm just trying to learn how to play
tonight. This is my guy. It's almost like it's the

00:05:30.838 --> 00:05:33.247
same person.

00:05:33.247 --> 00:05:40.839
SAM: All right, so with all that out of the way,
let's dive into another episode of Critical Role!

00:05:40.839 --> 00:07:10.407
[dramatic music]

00:07:10.468 --> 00:07:13.172
SAM: Hi guys! Welcome back!

00:07:13.172 --> 00:07:15.881
BRIAN: He got in just under the wire.

00:07:15.881 --> 00:07:18.611
LIAM: Safe. Totally safe.

00:07:18.611 --> 00:07:20.517
ERIC: How many drinks do you have going there?

00:07:20.517 --> 00:07:23.137
SAM: I have two drinks, one alcoholic--

00:07:23.137 --> 00:07:24.907
BRIAN: And one if that one breaks down.

00:07:24.907 --> 00:07:31.780
SAM: Okay. So needless to say, I'm super nervous
because I've never done this before, but it's

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:37.971
going to be fun, and if it sucks then who cares,
right? So let's just dive in, right? I'm going to

00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:40.065
play music from my iPad.

00:07:40.065 --> 00:07:42.924
BRIAN: Thank you for telling us everything you're
doing as you do it.

00:07:42.924 --> 00:07:49.569
SAM: I'm now turning to my notes. All right. I'm
about to begin the show.

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:53.483
BRIAN: This is great.

00:07:53.483 --> 00:08:02.522
SAM: Here we go. Black and white, as far as the
eye can see. The black of a cold night sky, the

00:08:02.522 --> 00:08:08.822
white of ice capping every tree and dusting the
roads below. It is a frigid, monochromatic night

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:15.630
in Jorenn Village, at the foot of the Umber
Hills-- until! A flash of yellow hair, hoofbeats,

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:22.708
a fast-moving horse, a young human woman riding at
top speed through the windy night. She barrels

00:08:22.708 --> 00:08:27.762
down the street, muttering to herself, "Shit,
shit, shit, I'm late again!"

00:08:27.762 --> 00:08:37.002
Then suddenly, a thunk. The horse whinnies. Did
she just hit something or someone? Oh no. The

00:08:37.002 --> 00:08:42.729
young woman stops, dismounts, walks back, and sees
an awful sight. An old woman in a simple grey

00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:52.632
robe, cane in a mangled hand, face bloody, arm
broken. She's motionless, ashen. "Oh fuck," says

00:08:52.632 --> 00:09:03.292
the girl. "Oh my fuck. I think I-- is that a-- I
just killed someone. Oh gods, what am I going to

00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:09.175
"do? I am so dead." The young woman looks around.
No one to call for a doctor. No fire-lit homes to

00:09:09.175 --> 00:09:11.157
knock on for help.

00:09:11.157 --> 00:09:20.539
Wait. No lights. No prying eyes. No &lt;i&gt;witnesses&lt;/i&gt;.
The rider takes a breath, kicks a little snow over

00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:26.263
the body of the old woman, checks the streets one
more time, and then mounts the horse and gets the

00:09:26.263 --> 00:09:33.588
hell out of there, no one the wiser. She rides on,
feeling guilty, but also relieved. No one saw,

00:09:33.588 --> 00:09:35.247
right? Right?

00:09:35.247 --> 00:09:40.361
In a few minutes she arrives at her destination,
shivering with cold. She ties her horse to the

00:09:40.361 --> 00:09:47.557
lion statue across the street, just in time for
her shift at the second crappiest tavern in town:

00:09:47.557 --> 00:09:56.900
The Ass Sailor. The sign above the door once said
"The Crass Sailor," but months ago, vandals pried

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:08.027
off the shitty letters C-R, so now it just reads,
"The Ass Sailor." The name seems to have resonated

00:10:08.027 --> 00:10:11.200
with its low-life patrons and they seem to prefer
it.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.852
The poorly built tavern sits on the foundation of
an old chapel, and some time in the last hundred

00:10:15.852 --> 00:10:22.394
years was expanded to two stories: a pub on the
bottom and rooms above. Despite its thin walls, it

00:10:22.394 --> 00:10:27.475
has one feature that regulars love on nights like
this: it is notoriously warm.

00:10:27.475 --> 00:10:34.135
The woman pushes open the door, jogs past the Ass
Sailor's source of heat: a large hearth, blurred

00:10:34.135 --> 00:10:39.994
with red coals. It's a small fireplace, but no
matter where you sit in The Ass Sailor, you always

00:10:39.994 --> 00:10:45.810
stay weirdly warm. So toasty, in fact, that
there's a massive pile of jackets and scarves and

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:51.981
weapons to the left of the door. Everyone inside
has stripped down to the bare minimum of dress.

00:10:51.981 --> 00:10:58.952
With the lack of clothing comes an oversupply of
skin, skin of all shades and body parts. The ruddy

00:10:58.952 --> 00:11:04.964
belly of a human salesman stuffing himself on
rotten mutton. The dark blue-tinted shoulder of a

00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:11.596
tiefling whore, enticing a gray, bearded, older
man upstairs. The gray forearm of a half-orc

00:11:11.596 --> 00:11:19.562
merchant, drawing a mug of Greep from the keg on
the bar. Greep, by the way, is a homemade house

00:11:19.562 --> 00:11:26.814
liqueur. It's so potent, its nickname is "kindling"
because it is also extremely flammable. Hint,

00:11:26.814 --> 00:11:31.461
hint, hint!

00:11:31.461 --> 00:11:34.206
LIAM: Red barrels, everywhere!

00:11:34.206 --> 00:11:40.430
SAM: "You're late!" calls the bar manager, Xavier,
wiping his hands on his grubby chef's apron.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:47.814
"I hit some unexpected traffic on the road!"
replies your late-shift bartender, Valerie, as she

00:11:47.814 --> 00:11:53.583
puts on her apron and ducks behind the bar. There
are a dozen tables, most populated with drunken

00:11:53.583 --> 00:12:00.088
assholes, half-witted con artists, and infectious
laughter. Val gets right to work on a night that

00:12:00.088 --> 00:12:03.322
will prove to be unlike any other.

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:11.111
At the bar, a noble half-elf woman with fiery
eyes, dark skin, and spectacular blonde hair

00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:17.673
nervously fidgets with her necklace. She glances
about, looking for someone. In an elegant blue

00:12:17.673 --> 00:12:23.846
and white gown and golden jewelry, she is
definitely out of place among the riffraff. This,

00:12:23.903 --> 00:12:26.229
we will learn, is Gryffin.

00:12:26.229 --> 00:12:34.203
Val, the bartender, approaches. "Hi. So what can I
get you?"

00:12:34.203 --> 00:12:36.864
MARY: What is your name?

00:12:36.864 --> 00:12:38.283
SAM: "Valerie, hi."

00:12:38.283 --> 00:12:42.019
MARy: Hello. Do you have any scotch?

00:12:42.019 --> 00:12:45.743
SAM: "Well, no." I have a menu.

00:12:45.743 --> 00:12:46.896
MARY: You do?

00:12:46.896 --> 00:12:55.460
SAM: I'm over-prepared. Oh god, I've lost the
menu. Oh god, everything's gone wrong one minute

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:59.048
into the show. Oh god. "We have ale."

00:12:59.048 --> 00:13:02.476
MARY: Any Fireball?

00:13:02.476 --> 00:13:10.125
SAM: "We have Greep, which is the house liqueur. We
have some whiskey, and we have some wine. The wine

00:13:10.125 --> 00:13:11.535
"is not very good."

00:13:11.535 --> 00:13:15.745
MARY: I'll have the whiskey. Actually, you know
what? Can I have whiskey with a Greep chaser, please?

00:13:15.745 --> 00:13:18.335
SAM: "Oh, sure. That'll be seven copper."

00:13:18.335 --> 00:13:19.560
MARY: All right, here.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.583
SAM: "There you go. What brings you around here?
Haven't seen you before."

00:13:23.583 --> 00:13:31.430
MARY: Oh, well, mostly to get out of the cold.
Actually, maybe you can help me. I'm so sorry.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:39.360
I've been looking for a girl, and there was a man
who told me of this place.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.837
SAM: "Well, we have two ladies of the night over
there. One is named Zarvah; she's the tiefling,

00:13:44.837 --> 00:13:51.040
"and she's a crowd pleaser. Yes. The other is Kay,
and she's over there as well."

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:57.121
MARY: Thank you, thank you. Actually, I was
looking for someone a bit younger than both of

00:13:57.121 --> 00:14:01.751
them. She has red hair. I'm wondering if you've
seen anyone quite like that?

00:14:01.751 --> 00:14:08.614
SAM: "I'm no one to judge but whatever sort of
thing floats your boat. I don't know any young

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:10.562
"whores, if that's what you're asking for."

00:14:10.562 --> 00:14:15.659
MARY: No, just a young girl. All right. Frankfurt,
have you heard of a man named Frankfurt?

00:14:15.659 --> 00:14:23.527
SAM: "Sure, yes. Frankfurt. He's a dwarven man. He
comes in here from time to time. I think he's on a

00:14:23.527 --> 00:14:25.199
"run. I haven't seen him tonight."

00:14:25.199 --> 00:14:30.086
MARY: All right. Well, he told me to come here, so
I did. So I'll just have a drink for now, if

00:14:30.086 --> 00:14:31.140
that's all right.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.421
SAM: "All right, I'll let you know if he
arrives."

00:14:33.421 --> 00:14:35.279
MARY: Thank you so much, I do appreciate that,
Val.

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:43.033
SAM: Just then, a tall female humanoid with
rippling biceps and long whiskers takes the next

00:14:43.033 --> 00:14:55.414
stool over. She's covered with tan and orange fur,
which is unsurprising because she is tabaxi, a

00:14:55.414 --> 00:15:02.436
cat-woman. Her feline face is bandaged from recent
battles, and she snarls with an imposing posture

00:15:02.436 --> 00:15:11.573
that says, "Don't fuck with me." This is
Clothesline. Val approaches. "Oh, hey,

00:15:11.573 --> 00:15:14.221
"Clothesline. The usual, I assume?"

00:15:14.221 --> 00:15:16.943
ASHLY: Do you have the milk that I ordered?

00:15:16.943 --> 00:15:23.601
SAM: "Yes." Val takes out a saucer of warm milk
and puts it on the bar. "Oh, and here's some

00:15:23.601 --> 00:15:29.451
"spice, too." She places a box of crimson powder on
the bar. It is catnip.

00:15:29.451 --> 00:15:31.457
ASHLY: Thanks, Val.

00:15:31.457 --> 00:15:34.619
SAM: "What happened to your face?"

00:15:34.619 --> 00:15:40.154
ASHLY: Oh, you know. It's a funny story. I
clotheslined some people.

00:15:40.154 --> 00:15:41.551
SAM: "Oh, that's--"

00:15:41.551 --> 00:15:48.307
ASHLY: Yeah. And their nails were not cut.
Generally when you clothesline someone you (clicks

00:15:48.307 --> 00:15:53.739
tongue) go, but they caught on for a little bit,
went for a little bit of a ride, and then I killed

00:15:53.739 --> 00:15:57.440
them. So that's that.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:04.447
SAM: "Wow. That sounds like a lovely evening?"

00:16:04.447 --> 00:16:08.740
AHSLY: Oh yeah, it was great! I could've done
without all the cleanup after. There was a lot of

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.573
blood. It's hard to get out of the old fur.

00:16:11.573 --> 00:16:17.935
SAM: "Sure. Clothesline, this is-- What was your
name again?"

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.958
MARY: Gryffin. Gryffin Erendel.

00:16:20.147 --> 00:16:21.223
ASHLY: Hi.

00:16:21.223 --> 00:16:22.952
MARY: Hello, how are you?

00:16:22.952 --> 00:16:25.098
ASHLY: You got weird eyes. What's the deal with
her eyes?

00:16:25.098 --> 00:16:28.061
MARY: They're gold. There's nothing wrong with
them.

00:16:28.061 --> 00:16:30.586
ASHLY: They're gold, like currency gold?

00:16:30.586 --> 00:16:38.768
MARY: No, they're not karated gold, they're just
gold. I'm a sunny Eladrin half-elf, all right?

00:16:38.768 --> 00:16:41.731
ASHLY: What does that mean?

00:16:41.731 --> 00:16:43.692
SAM: "I don't know. I don't really know."

00:16:43.692 --> 00:16:46.794
MARY: It doesn't matter. Why do you have fur? Why
does anybody have anything? It's just who I am.

00:16:46.794 --> 00:16:51.345
It's who you are. So cheers to us.

00:16:51.345 --> 00:16:53.653
ASHLY: I don't cheers ladies with weird eyes.

00:16:53.653 --> 00:17:00.994
MARY: All right. You've got a little blood on you
there, dear.

00:17:00.994 --> 00:17:09.021
SAM: As they speak, over at a small table, a young
human girl sits alone, peering out of her hooded

00:17:09.021 --> 00:17:17.303
cloak. She has almost translucent skin, and snowy
wisps of white hair fall over her face. Her cool

00:17:17.303 --> 00:17:22.275
blue eyes reveal a quiet confidence, but she seems
guarded and keeping her back to the wall, not

00:17:22.275 --> 00:17:29.638
touching her glass of water. This is Jayne.
Strolling over to the table, with a wobbly gait,

00:17:29.638 --> 00:17:37.922
is a short elven man with gray skin, gray hair,
and a black leather choker. He wears a sour

00:17:37.922 --> 00:17:44.337
expression and projects abject apathy. He reeks of
booze and appears to be wearing dark red eye

00:17:44.337 --> 00:17:50.372
makeup. This is Kingston, and it looks like
Kingston is approaching Jayne.

00:17:50.372 --> 00:17:58.574
BRIAN: Evening.

00:17:58.574 --> 00:18:00.349
LIAM: Oh, hello.

00:18:00.349 --> 00:18:04.566
BRIAN: Do you come here a lot?

00:18:04.566 --> 00:18:08.676
LIAM: No. I am traveling, actually.

00:18:08.676 --> 00:18:10.778
BRIAN: Alone?

00:18:10.778 --> 00:18:13.074
LIAM: Yes.

00:18:13.074 --> 00:18:19.096
BRIAN: By what mode of transportation are you
traveling?

00:18:19.096 --> 00:18:25.447
LIAM: Well, have a seat, I'll tell you everything.
Let's start with my childhood.

00:18:25.447 --> 00:18:30.246
BRIAN: Great! Do you want a drink?

00:18:30.246 --> 00:18:39.022
LIAM: No, and that was irony. I could have
something to eat. Do you want to get us something

00:18:39.022 --> 00:18:41.486
to eat?

00:18:41.486 --> 00:18:50.532
BRIAN: Yeah. Any dietary restrictions? I don't
want to walk over and then have to come back.

00:18:50.532 --> 00:18:52.583
LIAM: Just a little something.

00:18:52.583 --> 00:18:58.663
BRIAN: Okay. I'll walk over to Val. Unless there's
table service?

00:18:58.663 --> 00:19:05.238
SAM: Hell no. "Hi, Kingston. What can I get for
you?"

00:19:05.238 --> 00:19:09.581
BRIAN: Me and the child over there need food.

00:19:09.581 --> 00:19:11.938
SAM: "The child?"

00:19:11.938 --> 00:19:16.512
BRIAN: She's a bit young for me. I like them old.

00:19:16.512 --> 00:19:19.612
SAM: "You're going to buy this person food?"

00:19:19.612 --> 00:19:21.242
BRIAN: Yes.

00:19:21.242 --> 00:19:23.483
SAM: "With what money?"

00:19:23.483 --> 00:19:29.308
BRIAN: You can put it on my fucking tab, for
starters. She looks famished. She's traveled by

00:19:29.308 --> 00:19:34.343
some unknown mode of transportation. She looks
famished. She doesn't want a drink. She wants to

00:19:34.343 --> 00:19:37.303
eat. Put it on my tab. Consider it a humanitarian
gift.

00:19:37.303 --> 00:19:40.818
SAM: "All right, I'll give you some bread. All
right?"

00:19:40.818 --> 00:19:45.178
BRIAN: And also some Greep for me.

00:19:45.178 --> 00:19:55.439
SAM: "Fine." Takes a glass of Greep for you. "And
here's two loaves of bread. On your tab. Again."

00:19:55.439 --> 00:20:04.615
BRIAN: Thank you. I walk over and hand her the
loaves. Here you go.

00:20:04.615 --> 00:20:06.092
LIAM: That's nice.

00:20:06.092 --> 00:20:09.339
BRIAN: I get stuff free around here.

00:20:09.339 --> 00:20:10.984
LIAM: You're from here?

00:20:10.984 --> 00:20:12.700
BRIAN: Yeah. Nearby.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.584
LIAM: Is it always this cold?

00:20:15.584 --> 00:20:21.580
BRIAN: Well, not in here. But outside? Yeah, it's
pretty cold.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.176
LIAM: I'm sorry, what was your name?

00:20:24.176 --> 00:20:26.211
BRIAN: Kingston LaForge.

00:20:26.211 --> 00:20:27.543
LIAM: Strong name.

00:20:27.543 --> 00:20:30.463
BRIAN: Thank you. I come from a long line of
LaForges.

00:20:30.463 --> 00:20:37.408
LIAM: Tell me about yourself. And as he goes, she
starts inspecting the room, kind of listening.

00:20:37.408 --> 00:20:44.410
SAM: All right, you see a bunch of rowdy people
all about you. No one out of the ordinary that you

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:51.861
can see so far. Let's see here, what interesting
things? You know what? Make a perception check.

00:20:51.861 --> 00:21:01.163
LIAM: It was almost good. Ten.

00:21:01.163 --> 00:21:10.600
SAM: You see lots of festive people eating lots of
food and drinking lots of wine. That's about it.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.612
LIAM: Does anybody look dangerous?

00:21:13.612 --> 00:21:23.369
SAM: Dangerous? Well, most of the people in here
are weaponless. Some do have weapons. The tabaxi

00:21:23.369 --> 00:21:34.857
over there is packing some biceps and some sharp
claws. There's a couple of guards. There's one

00:21:34.857 --> 00:21:40.657
guard over near the door who's watching people's
cloaks and whatever weapons have been checked.

00:21:40.657 --> 00:21:47.931
There's another city guard who's drinking, but
he's got his sword. He's near the wall over there.

00:21:47.931 --> 00:21:54.911
He's got his sword sheathed, and he looks like he
could do some damage, maybe. That's about it. The

00:21:54.911 --> 00:22:00.087
prostitutes look really feisty, and one of them is
having an argument, still,

00:22:00.087 --> 00:22:02.340
with this man, about payment.

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.777
LIAM: So you were going to tell me your story?

00:22:04.777 --> 00:22:08.554
BRIAN: Did you see that cat lady over there?

00:22:08.554 --> 00:22:10.855
LIAM: Yes, I did.

00:22:10.855 --> 00:22:22.765
BRIAN: She is something else. I'm not saying I
have a type, but my preferred terrain is a litter box.

00:22:22.765 --> 00:22:30.776
LIAM: You know, I'm happy to share the loaves of
bread with you, but my feelings won't be hurt if

00:22:30.776 --> 00:22:33.135
you want to change over.

00:22:33.135 --> 00:22:42.686
BRIAN: Thank you, but I'll tell you a little bit
about myself first. What would you like to know?

00:22:42.686 --> 00:22:46.015
LIAM: Oh, start from the beginning. You grew up
here? Tell me all about it.

00:22:46.015 --> 00:22:51.819
BRIAN: I was born Kingston LaForge. Still am. To a
long line of LaForges.

00:22:51.819 --> 00:22:54.489
MARY: Did you hear him say Kingston LaForge?

00:22:54.489 --> 00:22:56.329
BRIAN: My family was acrobats.

00:22:56.329 --> 00:22:58.592
ASHLY: Why is she talking to me, Val?

00:22:58.592 --> 00:23:10.818
BRIAN: Carnies. 24/7 locksmiths. I, however, was
afraid of heights, so I had to learn how to sing

00:23:10.818 --> 00:23:23.560
for my supper. However, nature took over around
the age of teen. I lost my beautiful singing

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.040
voice. It was a falsetto, a very lovely falsetto.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.526
LIAM: When you were young, you lost it? That must
have been a long time ago.

00:23:30.526 --> 00:23:46.122
BRIAN: Oh yes, over 100 years. So I left my family
and the traveling circus, and I found myself a

00:23:46.122 --> 00:23:53.830
wife, Cloris. We wed, and together, I wrote some
of the best books the land has ever seen.

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:58.546
LIAM: Jayne is quietly digging her fingernails
into her leg to stop from screaming.

00:23:58.546 --> 00:24:02.211
MARY: I quietly start pounding on the bar.

00:24:02.211 --> 00:24:08.027
BRIAN: Together, we bore a child, and it was one
of the most incredible things that ever happened

00:24:08.027 --> 00:24:10.228
to me. The child was precious.

00:24:10.228 --> 00:24:13.006
ASHLY: Oh my god, Kingston, give it a rest!

00:24:13.006 --> 00:24:15.169
BRIAN: Hi!

00:24:15.169 --> 00:24:16.403
ASHLY: Hi.

00:24:16.403 --> 00:24:18.530
BRIAN: I was just talking to this child--

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:23.307
ASHLY: Yeah, I get it. It's creepy. Could you stop
creeping us all out? You re-hash your goddamn life

00:24:23.307 --> 00:24:25.353
story every time you come in here.

00:24:25.353 --> 00:24:35.354
BRIAN: She asked! I simply brought her free food.
She asked me a question. I have an interesting story.

00:24:35.354 --> 00:24:41.269
ASHLY: You don't have an interesting-- No! Your
beautiful falsetto? No! No one cares!

00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:43.200
BRIAN: You say that because you never got to hear
it.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.963
MARY: Hello, I'm sorry, my name is Gryffin Erendel
and I'm the biggest fan. I can't begin to tell you

00:24:47.963 --> 00:24:52.294
how much I love your work. Your book of poetry,
Black and White, was one of the most amazing

00:24:52.294 --> 00:24:56.262
things I've ever read in my entire life and I
happen to have a copy with me. Would you please

00:24:56.262 --> 00:24:59.012
sign it? Do you mind? I don't want to intrude. I
would pay for it.

00:24:59.012 --> 00:25:01.615
BRIAN: Have you read some of my other books?

00:25:01.615 --> 00:25:03.448
MARY: Yes, I have!

00:25:03.448 --> 00:25:05.390
BRIAN: Two Witches, One Broom?

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.518
MARY: Yes, yes! The Wicked Grouse?

00:25:07.518 --> 00:25:11.944
BRIAN: Yes, Doors: The Idiot's Enemy?

00:25:11.944 --> 00:25:13.826
ASHLY: Val, another milk, please!

00:25:13.826 --> 00:25:16.708
BRIAN: Here you go. Here's your book.

00:25:16.708 --> 00:25:18.465
SAM: "I made it a double."

00:25:18.465 --> 00:25:19.759
ASHLY: Thank you.

00:25:19.759 --> 00:25:22.942
MARY: You have no idea. Would you read from it?

00:25:22.942 --> 00:25:32.764
BRIAN: I will, after. May I talk to you for a
minute? I know, may I just-- (sighs) I know we

00:25:32.764 --> 00:25:39.360
don't get along very often. However, I find you to
be very attractive.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.769
ASHLY: Oh, what the hell, Kingston!

00:25:41.769 --> 00:25:49.030
BRIAN: I've struggled on how to say this to you,
but--

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:54.454
ASHLY: You are this close from a claw in your
goddamn eye, Kingston. So choose the next few

00:25:54.454 --> 00:25:57.470
words carefully.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:59.518
BRIAN: Catnip and chill?

00:25:59.518 --> 00:26:01.610
ASHLY: Can I attack Kingston?

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:05.329
SAM: Sure! Whatever you want to do.

00:26:05.329 --> 00:26:08.149
MARY: I step back.

00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:10.422
ASHLY: I try to punch Kingston in the mouth.

00:26:10.422 --> 00:26:12.368
SAM: All right, roll for an attack.

00:26:12.368 --> 00:26:18.975
ASHLY: Okay, let's see. I don't want to use my
claws. I guess I'm going to clothesline him.

00:26:18.975 --> 00:26:21.716
SAM: Great. Clothesline attack.

00:26:21.716 --> 00:26:23.017
ASHLY: 1d4.

00:26:23.017 --> 00:26:26.439
SAM: Roll a d20, add, what is it, five?

00:26:26.439 --> 00:26:27.960
ASHLY: 13.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.816
SAM: Okay, what's your armor class there,
Kingston?

00:26:30.816 --> 00:26:36.462
BRIAN: My armor? 13.

00:26:36.462 --> 00:26:45.817
SAM: That's a hit, right, Liam? 13 and 13, that's
a hit? All right, roll for damage. 1d4 plus something.

00:26:45.817 --> 00:26:47.650
ASHLY: Eight!

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:53.454
SAM: Wow! Did you roll a four? Okay, so you don't
have to roll for anything.

00:26:53.454 --> 00:26:56.695
BRIAN: Hold on, I'm buried in my notes.

00:26:56.695 --> 00:27:01.557
SAM: So Clothesline has a special clothesline
attack. If she rolls a four, it's eight points of

00:27:01.557 --> 00:27:04.505
damage to you, sir, and you are knocked prone.

00:27:04.505 --> 00:27:07.030
BRIAN: Shit, that's amazing!

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:09.700
SAM: That's a big fucking hit.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:15.899
ASHLY: It is! I deliberately didn't use my claws
because I didn't want to hurt you too much!

00:27:15.899 --> 00:27:23.175
SAM: So Kingston slams down onto the floor, taking
a couple of drinks with him. He's dazed. He's

00:27:23.175 --> 00:27:25.932
woozy. He looks around. He didn't even see it
coming.

00:27:25.932 --> 00:27:27.438
BRIAN: Did my drink go with me?

00:27:27.438 --> 00:27:32.297
SAM: Sure, yeah. Greep all over the floor. All
over you. You now have a flammable alcohol all

00:27:32.297 --> 00:27:38.086
over you. It's probably stinging your eyes. You
hardly know who hit you or why.

00:27:38.086 --> 00:27:40.945
BRIAN: I'm blinded!

00:27:40.945 --> 00:27:44.975
MARY: He will write of this day, and I will know
that I was here!

00:27:44.975 --> 00:27:48.296
BRIAN: You're going to have to write this down. I
can't see!

00:27:48.296 --> 00:27:50.133
MARY: It's all in my mind!

00:27:50.133 --> 00:27:56.030
SAM: Xavier, the manager, comes over. "All right,
enough of that! No fights tonight, all right?"

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:57.297
ASHLY: Sorry, Xave, sorry.

00:27:57.297 --> 00:28:02.186
BRIAN: It was just foreplay. We have a big night
planned, and I'm sorry we started it in your

00:28:02.186 --> 00:28:03.222
establishment.

00:28:03.222 --> 00:28:05.261
ASHLY: No fights? What about a murder? One
murder?

00:28:05.261 --> 00:28:07.772
SAM: "Nothing like that tonight, please."

00:28:07.772 --> 00:28:09.819
MARY: I use Prestidigitation to cleanse him off.

00:28:09.819 --> 00:28:13.446
ASHLY: What did you just do?

00:28:13.446 --> 00:28:21.310
SAM: Some magical energy comes out of her and
magically cleans up the stains off of his shirt.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:28.429
Everyone in the bar turns to see and goes like
this to you when you do it. You are no longer

00:28:28.429 --> 00:28:29.397
flammable.

00:28:29.397 --> 00:28:38.522
ASHLY: What the hell was that? What you just did?
Creepy guy? He's no longer whatever?

00:28:38.522 --> 00:28:40.174
MARY: What, you've never heard of magic?

00:28:40.174 --> 00:28:43.104
ASHLY: I know about magic.

00:28:43.104 --> 00:28:46.271
MARY: Oh, you do? Well then, why are you asking me
such a silly question?

00:28:46.271 --> 00:28:50.366
ASHLY: Val, I'm going to move to a table.

00:28:50.366 --> 00:28:51.436
SAM: "Sure."

00:28:51.436 --> 00:28:53.196
MARY: I meant no offense.

00:28:53.196 --> 00:29:01.258
SAM: As the tabaxi glides across the room, finding
another table, let's move you over here. I just

00:29:01.258 --> 00:29:02.741
knocked over a stool.

00:29:02.741 --> 00:29:08.628
BRIAN: I'm going to walk back over to Jayne. Yeah,
because things didn't go as well as I was hoping.

00:29:08.628 --> 00:29:16.949
SAM: So you're alone by the bar now? Yes. And just
then, the wind whips into the bar again as the

00:29:16.949 --> 00:29:26.508
door opens. Valerie, the bartender, gasps, scared
it might be the dead old lady. But instead, it is

00:29:26.508 --> 00:29:34.606
not. Two stout male dwarves walk in. Behind them,
a young girl with fire-red hair and elven ears.

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:48.535
They walk in, and let's put them here for now. One dwarf
is sullen, with thick muttonchops and a stumpy

00:29:48.535 --> 00:30:00.152
axe. He says, "I tire of the road. We eat here and
rest. Frankfurt, this is your job. You pay. Obby

00:30:00.152 --> 00:30:02.010
"the Rat is done for the day."

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:06.011
ASHLY and LIAM: Yes!

00:30:06.011 --> 00:30:10.957
SAM: The other dwarf is a younger, stronger man
with a braided beard, piercing eyes, and a heavy

00:30:10.957 --> 00:30:16.546
maul in his hand. He scans the room and picks a
table. Unlike some of the patrons, these two do

00:30:16.546 --> 00:30:21.851
not check their weapons. Instead, they park them
under the table. This is Frankfurt and his friend,

00:30:21.851 --> 00:30:28.899
Obby the Rat. They pull up a chair for the young,
fair-skinned ginger girl, who joins them. Her eyes

00:30:28.899 --> 00:30:36.406
sparkle with innocence and a touch of fear. Her
name, we will learn, is Holly. "You have been to

00:30:36.406 --> 00:30:37.883
"this place before?"

00:30:37.883 --> 00:30:41.242
ERIC: Yep, many times. Known for their Greep.

00:30:41.242 --> 00:30:42.839
SAM: "What is that?"

00:30:42.839 --> 00:30:46.315
ERIC: Delicious, is what it is. You should try
some.

00:30:46.315 --> 00:30:48.728
SAM: "Obby the Rat drinks ale."

00:30:48.728 --> 00:30:56.023
ERIC: Careful, there's a cat-woman in here. You
might want to be careful of that. Val!

00:30:56.023 --> 00:30:57.660
Two Greeps, please!

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:03.133
SAM: "Yes, right away, Frankfurt! That's him."

00:31:03.133 --> 00:31:04.775
MARY: Thank you so much.

00:31:04.775 --> 00:31:06.356
SAM: "Certainly. Tips would be appreciated."

00:31:06.356 --> 00:31:10.054
MARY: Oh, of course! What was I thinking? Here. I
give her a piece of gold.

00:31:10.054 --> 00:31:12.405
SAM: "Oh, wow. Thank you very much."

00:31:12.405 --> 00:31:13.560
MARY: You're welcome.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.906
ERIC: I start taking off my clothes.

00:31:15.906 --> 00:31:17.192
SAM: "All of your clothes?"

00:31:17.192 --> 00:31:20.070
ERIC: Almost all. It's hot. It's boiling in here.

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:28.176
SAM: "It is very hot. Are you sure you want to
strip down? There are unsavory types in here."

00:31:28.176 --> 00:31:33.345
ERIC: I'm a regular. They've seen the merchandise
before.

00:31:33.345 --> 00:31:34.911
SAM: "Yes."

00:31:34.911 --> 00:31:39.795
ERIC: But don't attract too much attention to us.
We've got some cargo here that people might be

00:31:39.795 --> 00:31:41.123
interested in.

00:31:41.123 --> 00:31:45.964
SAM: "What cargo? We are not transporting any
cargo tonight."

00:31:45.964 --> 00:31:50.940
ERIC: Well, not anything in particular that anyone
would be looking for, but have

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.358
you seen Garello around?

00:31:54.358 --> 00:32:03.968
SAM: "I do not know this Garello. You have spoken
of him, but I don't know that I would recognize him."

00:32:03.968 --> 00:32:06.984
ERIC: Well, keep your eyes peeled.

00:32:06.984 --> 00:32:09.565
SAM: "Perhaps ask someone else."

00:32:09.565 --> 00:32:16.726
ERIC: Hey, Cat-Woman?

00:32:16.726 --> 00:32:18.934
ASHLY: Oh, for fuck's sake, what?

00:32:18.934 --> 00:32:21.910
ERIC: How are you?

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.815
ASHLY: How do I look?

00:32:23.815 --> 00:32:31.196
ERIC: Bloody! And your glass is half empty. Val!
More milk, please!

00:32:31.196 --> 00:32:35.898
SAM: "Right away. Whole or skim this time?"

00:32:35.898 --> 00:32:37.795
ASHLY: Give me the raw shit.

00:32:37.795 --> 00:32:39.100
SAM: "Okay."

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:43.313
ERIC: So! How's your night been?

00:32:43.313 --> 00:32:45.393
ASHLY: I've had better.

00:32:45.393 --> 00:32:49.525
ERIC: Okay. Any scraps you've been into?

00:32:49.525 --> 00:32:51.347
ASHLY: What do you want, man?

00:32:51.347 --> 00:32:57.370
ERIC: Okay, look. I'm going to get down to
business here. I've got this girl, and we're

00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:01.729
looking for a guy named Garello. Maybe you've
heard of him?

00:33:01.729 --> 00:33:03.097
ASHLY: Garello?

00:33:03.097 --> 00:33:13.724
ERIC: G-A-R-E-L-L-O. I got to make a delivery, and
I want to get it over with.

00:33:13.724 --> 00:33:19.215
ASHLY: Is this the type of thing that I can roll
to see if I have information of?

00:33:19.215 --> 00:33:23.236
SAM: Sure, yeah. Why don't you make an
intelligence check?

00:33:23.236 --> 00:33:31.398
ASHLY: That's not going to go well. What does that
stand for? That's a natural 20? Never mind. I

00:33:31.398 --> 00:33:34.596
haven't used these dice before.

00:33:34.596 --> 00:33:41.340
SAM: So you don't personally know Garello, but you
are a woman about town who hears things, hears

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:50.806
whispers, talks with unsavory sorts. You have
heard there is a man in town, not from here, named

00:33:50.806 --> 00:33:59.231
Garello, who has been poking his nose around The
Ass Sailor, waiting for something. But you haven't

00:33:59.231 --> 00:34:00.724
met him yet.

00:34:00.724 --> 00:34:02.343
ASHLY: So I don't know what he looks like or
anything like that?

00:34:02.343 --> 00:34:06.915
SAM: No, just that he's been asking around. He's
been here before.

00:34:06.915 --> 00:34:09.110
LIAM: He's way up in The Ass Sailor.

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:12.040
BRIAN: He's ass-deep in the sailor.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.976
ERIC: Well, good to know.

00:34:15.976 --> 00:34:27.941
BRIAN: Jayne? Picking up quickly where we left
off, I apologize for how that went. I had a wife,

00:34:27.941 --> 00:34:37.144
Cloris, I mentioned. A child. We named our child
Denise. She was beautiful, yet expensive.

00:34:37.144 --> 00:34:39.891
MARY: I slowly make my way over to Frankfurt.

00:34:39.891 --> 00:34:47.252
BRIAN: One day, I came home and found my wife in
bed with another man. And not even a real man, a

00:34:47.252 --> 00:34:49.114
half a man. A dwarf.

00:34:49.114 --> 00:34:52.804
ERIC: Oh! I spilled something on my pants.

00:34:52.804 --> 00:34:56.233
BRIAN: The last time I saw that dwarf, I told him
I was going to fucking kill him if I saw him

00:34:56.233 --> 00:35:02.741
again, and he just walked into the fucking bar.
That's him over there.

00:35:02.741 --> 00:35:04.278
SAM: "What is wrong with you?"

00:35:04.278 --> 00:35:05.936
ERIC: Hey, hey, hey.

00:35:05.936 --> 00:35:06.945
SAM: "What?"

00:35:06.945 --> 00:35:13.105
ERIC: Obby, there's a dude over there. He's
staring right at us. Don't make any moves.

00:35:13.105 --> 00:35:14.811
SAM: "Which dude?"

00:35:14.811 --> 00:35:16.494
ERIC: That guy, arms crossed.

00:35:16.494 --> 00:35:18.947
LIAM: So you're telling me this man has impugned
your honor.

00:35:18.947 --> 00:35:21.119
BRIAN: My family's honor.

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:27.492
ERIC: I may have fucked up. Well, not &lt;i&gt;me,&lt;/i&gt; but I
fucked someone--

00:35:27.492 --> 00:35:30.725
BRIAN: I came home and she was sitting on his
frankfurter.

00:35:30.725 --> 00:35:39.879
ERIC: Oh shit. You know, the T in my name stands
for "The." Frankfurt The Dwarf. I have to tell you

00:35:39.879 --> 00:35:41.069
a secret.

00:35:41.069 --> 00:35:42.796
SAM: "Do you have a beef with this gentleman?"

00:35:42.796 --> 00:35:44.620
BRIAN: Oh, there's beef involved, all right.

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:46.860
ERIC: Yeah, you could say that. There was beef.

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.652
BRIAN: Yeah, there was a little too much beef, if
you ask me.

00:35:49.652 --> 00:35:51.151
SAM: "Do you want me to go kill him?"

00:35:51.151 --> 00:35:56.474
ERIC: You could try? Do your old pal a favor?

00:35:56.474 --> 00:36:01.334
BRIAN: I cast Message to Gryffin.

00:36:01.334 --> 00:36:03.341
SAM: Okay, sure.

00:36:03.341 --> 00:36:08.400
BRIAN: Can I send her a secret thing? Can I tell
her a message?

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.669
SAM: Yes, Message will make a whisper appear in
her ear.

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:13.149
MARY: And I can whisper back.

00:36:13.149 --> 00:36:14.527
SAM: Once.

00:36:14.527 --> 00:36:18.438
BRIAN: Gryffin, that dwarf fucked my wife.

00:36:18.438 --> 00:36:22.016
(laughter)

00:36:22.016 --> 00:36:28.201
SAM: So Gryffin, you're sitting at the bar looking
around. You don't know who just talked to you. All

00:36:28.201 --> 00:36:35.910
of a sudden, you hear this voice in your ear that
says, "That dwarf fucked my wife." You vaguely

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:42.182
have heard the voice before, but it's loud in
here. You have no idea what the fuck just

00:36:42.182 --> 00:36:43.841
happened.

00:36:43.841 --> 00:36:45.527
BRIAN: Am I allowed to add to it?

00:36:45.527 --> 00:36:46.745
SAM: Sure.

00:36:46.745 --> 00:36:56.489
BRIAN: By the way, it's me, Kingston LaForge, from
earlier. I signed the book that I wrote.

00:36:56.489 --> 00:36:59.260
MARY: Is that the title of your new book?

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.896
SAM: And the spell fades.

00:37:00.896 --> 00:37:03.014
(laughter)

00:37:03.014 --> 00:37:06.534
SAM: Expert use of Message.

00:37:06.534 --> 00:37:12.412
MARY: So I continue to work my way slowly, slyly,
away from the bar.

00:37:12.412 --> 00:37:24.576
SAM: Okay, as you travel across the room, Liam
opens a book of some sort. As you are walking

00:37:24.576 --> 00:37:31.790
across the room, Jayne, our young girl played by
Liam O'Brien, starts eyeing Clothesline and trying

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:49.016
to get her eye contact. She raises an index finger
to her eyebrow and winks. I think? Oh. Yes. There

00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:57.911
is some sort of a wink or a nod exchanged. Yes?
Okay. At which point Clothesline looks around her,

00:37:57.911 --> 00:38:06.565
having received some sort of a signal. To her left
is one human guard. Where the fuck did you go?

00:38:06.565 --> 00:38:09.177
MARY: Is that the guy you threw away?

00:38:09.177 --> 00:38:12.612
SAM: No, where's the tabaxi? Where is the cat
lady?

00:38:12.612 --> 00:38:14.159
BRIAN: Oh, she went to a table.

00:38:14.159 --> 00:38:22.850
SAM: (laughing) Where is she? There's too many
people in here. Oh, there she is. Okay, so to her

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:33.364
left is one human guard ordering a drink. To her
right, one half-orc merchant. Behind her has

00:38:33.364 --> 00:38:37.787
wandered Zarvah the whore. And she turns.

00:38:37.787 --> 00:38:39.247
BRIAN: How old would you say she is?

00:38:39.247 --> 00:38:40.150
SAM: Who?

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:41.166
BRIAN: Zarvah the whore.

00:38:41.166 --> 00:38:46.006
SAM: Zarvah the whore is a tiefling. I don't know
how tiefling ageing works, so I'm going to say 30.

00:38:46.006 --> 00:38:48.274
(laughter)

00:38:48.274 --> 00:38:49.834
BRIAN: Do you know how old the other one is?

00:38:49.834 --> 00:38:50.692
SAM: The other whore?

00:38:50.692 --> 00:38:51.497
BRIAN: Yeah.

00:38:51.497 --> 00:38:52.654
SAM: Is older, much older.

00:38:52.654 --> 00:38:53.544
BRIAN: Like &lt;i&gt;old&lt;/i&gt;?

00:38:53.544 --> 00:38:57.651
SAM: Yeah. Her name is Kay, I think.

00:38:57.651 --> 00:39:00.004
BRIAN: Kay is the elderly one?

00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:06.080
SAM: Yes. Clothesline looks around. Human guard,
half-orc, Zarvah the whore. Would you like to do

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.841
anything, Clothesline?

00:39:07.841 --> 00:39:14.553
LIAM: Actually, quickly I whisper over to the
weird one and I pull out my holy symbol of the

00:39:14.553 --> 00:39:22.195
Lawbearer and say: there is a time and a place for
law and civilization, but your experience sounds

00:39:22.195 --> 00:39:26.678
trying, and I know what I would do. And I tuck the
medallion away.

00:39:26.678 --> 00:39:33.275
BRIAN: Look, you seem like a sweet chick, but what
the fuck were you grabbing onto? What was this?

00:39:33.275 --> 00:39:36.514
What is that? What is the necklace? What is that?

00:39:36.514 --> 00:39:38.749
LIAM: Are you not familiar with the gods?

00:39:38.749 --> 00:39:49.480
BRIAN: Fuck the gods! The gods?! Sarenrae's a
bitch! Kord couldn't lift a dead sparrow! The

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:57.118
Chained Oblivion took your mom to second base and
never called her again. Fuck the gods!

00:39:57.118 --> 00:40:02.336
SAM: Yes. Gryffin has arrived over at the table,
yes.

00:40:02.336 --> 00:40:08.854
ASHLY: Where's my movement? My speed, right?

00:40:08.854 --> 00:40:10.706
SAM: All right. You're fast, 30, I think?

00:40:10.706 --> 00:40:12.606
ASHLY: 30, yeah. Can I reach Gryffin?

00:40:12.606 --> 00:40:17.946
SAM: Yeah, sure. Let's see here. Five, ten. Yes,
sure. You're going to have to dodge around some

00:40:17.946 --> 00:40:26.315
dudes, but yeah, you can reach Gryffin. Sure.
Would you like to move there? All right. With

00:40:26.315 --> 00:40:33.035
cat-like grace, she leaps up onto the table, back
to there, back up on the bar, back down, back on

00:40:33.035 --> 00:40:36.680
the table, all the way over to Gryffin right
there.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.545
LIAM: Assassin's Creed.

00:40:38.545 --> 00:40:41.099
MARY: With Gilbert and Sullivan playing in the
background.

00:40:41.099 --> 00:40:46.290
SAM: And no one even hears you move, you're so
dexterous and awesome.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:49.395
MARY: I'm pulling out a small bag of gold.

00:40:49.395 --> 00:40:54.947
ASHLY: And to immediately ruin my stealth, I go:
Sorry, Xavier! Bar fight! And I hit Gryffin.

00:40:54.947 --> 00:40:57.609
SAM: What did you roll?

00:40:57.609 --> 00:40:58.466
ASHLY: 14.

00:40:58.466 --> 00:41:00.172
MARY: Yeah, that hits.

00:41:00.172 --> 00:41:03.454
SAM: Okay. What are you attacking with? Your
claws, or--

00:41:03.454 --> 00:41:07.337
ASHLY: Oh yeah, what should I attack with? I'll
attack with my claws.

00:41:07.337 --> 00:41:09.721
SAM: Claws. So plus, what is it? Five?

00:41:09.721 --> 00:41:10.679
ASHLY: Five. Yeah.

00:41:10.679 --> 00:41:20.206
SAM: So it's a 19, right? Okay. That hits. Okay.
This is &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;. So the words "bar fight" ring out,

00:41:20.206 --> 00:41:30.600
everyone turns, looks to the source of the action
over there at the table, and with razor-like

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:37.278
claws-- right? You did a claw attack? Digging into
the back of your head, Gryffin, you feel intense

00:41:37.278 --> 00:41:39.385
pain, and roll for damage.

00:41:39.385 --> 00:41:42.486
ASHLY: That is a five.

00:41:42.486 --> 00:41:50.684
SAM: Five. Take five hit points off there, Gryff.
You feel these claws dig into the back of your

00:41:50.684 --> 00:42:00.479
head, you feel blood trickling down your neck. It
sucks. What would you like to do, Gryffin?

00:42:00.479 --> 00:42:13.306
MARY: I turn and I cast Reduce.

00:42:13.306 --> 00:42:19.045
SAM: Reduce? Not familiar with that one. Oh,
Reduce Size!

00:42:19.045 --> 00:42:20.121
MARY: Reduce Size!

00:42:20.121 --> 00:42:26.176
SAM: Yes! I am familiar with that one. Okay, as
you do that, I need everyone to roll initiative.

00:42:26.176 --> 00:42:29.683
It is a bar fight.

00:42:29.683 --> 00:42:32.306
ASHLY: 14.

00:42:32.306 --> 00:42:35.674
MARY: Natural 20! Thanks for not fucking me, Gil!

00:42:35.674 --> 00:42:46.464
SAM: Oh god! Okay. Everyone get your numbers in
your head. I'm going to roll for about seven other

00:42:46.464 --> 00:43:06.130
people. Okay. Sure. Uh-huh. Oh yeah. Yep. Uh-huh.
Oh, not good. Not good. Uh-huh.

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:12.502
BRIAN: Guys, don't forget to get the Tal'Dorei
Campaign Guide book, available from Green Ronin

00:43:12.502 --> 00:43:14.293
Publishers, Inc.

00:43:14.293 --> 00:43:18.682
LIAM: And a special shout-out to Dwarven Forge for
sending me all this shit two days ago!

00:43:18.682 --> 00:43:21.341
BRIAN: Thank you, Dwarven Forge, for the awesome
mappage.

00:43:21.341 --> 00:43:27.134
SAM: All right. Give me your numbers. Anyone from
20 to 25?

00:43:27.134 --> 00:43:28.883
MARY: 20. Natural 20.

00:43:28.883 --> 00:43:36.913
SAM: Ooh, okay. Where are you? You're down here.
Great. Who's next? Anyone from 20 to 25, anyone

00:43:36.913 --> 00:43:38.367
from 15 to 20?

00:43:38.367 --> 00:43:39.491
LIAM: 16.

00:43:39.491 --> 00:43:47.631
SAM: 16. Okay. Good. Yes. Anyone else 15 to 20?
No? Ten to 15?

00:43:47.631 --> 00:43:49.102
ASHLY: 14. Sorry.

00:43:49.102 --> 00:43:50.189
ERIC: Go for it.

00:43:50.189 --> 00:43:51.447
ASHLY: 14, yeah.

00:43:51.447 --> 00:43:52.461
ERIC: 13.

00:43:52.461 --> 00:43:54.653
SAM: 13. Frankfurt, what do you got?

00:43:54.653 --> 00:43:57.571
BRIAN: That'd be a three. That would be a big old
three.

00:43:57.571 --> 00:43:59.246
SAM: Gnarly!

00:43:59.246 --> 00:44:07.983
BRIAN: (singing) Roll a little three in Kingston
town! Down, down, down to Kingston town.

00:44:07.983 --> 00:44:17.290
SAM: Let me do the order here. (singing) There are
so many people in this bar! Why would I do this to

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:27.983
myself? (speaking) Yep. This was a bad idea. Okay.
Nine.

00:44:27.983 --> 00:44:30.360
BRIAN: This is your Liam's beach, Sam.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:41.036
SAM: Yep! Okay, good. We got 13 people to keep
track of. Great. All right, here we go! Wait, I

00:44:41.195 --> 00:44:45.470
got some battle music playing. Is it playing?
Sure. I don't know. I don't know what any of this

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:54.353
shit is. (giggles) Okay. You cast Reduce. Your
spell DC is what?

00:44:54.353 --> 00:45:02.385
MARY: Exactly! (mumbling) But where's the spell
DC?

00:45:02.385 --> 00:45:05.422
BRIAN: Right here.

00:45:05.422 --> 00:45:06.694
MARY: 14.

00:45:06.694 --> 00:45:14.362
SAM: Okay. Oh, you have to save. Is it a
constitution save? Do you know? I can look.

00:45:14.362 --> 00:45:18.416
BRIAN: It's on the card, too. Oh yeah, you got it
here.

00:45:18.416 --> 00:45:19.801
MARY: Yeah, it's a concentration.

00:45:19.801 --> 00:45:22.750
SAM: Concentration?

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:24.024
BRIAN: Yeah, constitution saving throw.

00:45:24.024 --> 00:45:26.869
SAM: So roll 20, add your constitution save
modifier.

00:45:26.869 --> 00:45:28.194
ASHLY: 19.

00:45:28.194 --> 00:45:34.852
SAM: A blast of sorcerous energy comes out of
Gryffin's hands? What do you use to cast things?

00:45:34.852 --> 00:45:36.127
MARY: My hands!

00:45:36.127 --> 00:45:44.075
SAM: Your hands. And the magical energy passes
right through you, it's a burst of strange

00:45:44.075 --> 00:45:49.152
tingling sensation that bursts right past your
face, but you shake off the effects and nothing

00:45:49.152 --> 00:45:50.360
happens.

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:52.274
MARY: So I didn't need to roll to attack?

00:45:52.274 --> 00:46:01.562
SAM: That's a spell, yes? So you don't roll on
spells, I don't believe. Unless I'm wrong about

00:46:01.562 --> 00:46:02.704
these things?

00:46:02.704 --> 00:46:03.862
LIAM: Which is the spell?

00:46:03.862 --> 00:46:09.107
SAM: It's not a ranged attack, Reduce, right? It's
just a spell. Does it say ranged attack or

00:46:09.107 --> 00:46:10.265
anything?

00:46:10.265 --> 00:46:13.948
BRIAN: Yeah, no. It's 30 feet.

00:46:13.948 --> 00:46:18.665
SAM: I don't know how to play, and I don't know
how to DM. I would appreciate that we hold all

00:46:18.665 --> 00:46:20.478
questions to the end of the session.

00:46:20.478 --> 00:46:24.190
LIAM: Don't worry, there are people tweeting
advice right now that you can see

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:25.315
three hours later.

00:46:25.315 --> 00:46:31.513
MARY: Because I thought I always would roll for
attack, whether it's a spell or not? I don't know.

00:46:31.513 --> 00:46:34.362
SAM: Not tonight, Mary.

00:46:34.362 --> 00:46:37.668
MARY: So everything is going to be 15 all night,
with all the spells?

00:46:37.668 --> 00:46:42.511
SAM: No, that's your spell save DC, right? You
have a spell save DC, it's on page two of your thing.

00:46:42.511 --> 00:46:48.337
LIAM: The &lt;i&gt;target&lt;/i&gt; makes a constitution save for
this one.

00:46:48.337 --> 00:46:55.222
SAM: For spells like Chromatic Orb or other
things, those are ranged attacks that you roll for

00:46:55.222 --> 00:47:01.418
your attack. Reduce is just a thing that happens.
You don't have to target anyone.

00:47:01.418 --> 00:47:02.963
LIAM: Are you shrinking yourself or someone else?

00:47:02.963 --> 00:47:04.211
MARY: No, someone else.

00:47:04.211 --> 00:47:05.957
LIAM: So you have to make a constitution save.

00:47:05.957 --> 00:47:09.978
ASHLY: I did, and I cannot be shrunk! I'm
unshrinkable.

00:47:09.978 --> 00:47:22.620
SAM: Okay. So nothing happened. But it is your
round, Gryffin. That was a surprise attack. No, it

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:25.544
wasn't a surprise attack, you fucking attacked
first. So you still get a bonus action and a move

00:47:25.544 --> 00:47:26.910
if you would like.

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:34.474
MARY: Yes! But it has to be a specific bonus
action.

00:47:34.474 --> 00:47:38.252
SAM: If you have a spell that you can cast as a
bonus action.

00:47:38.252 --> 00:47:42.822
MARY: I don't think I do. And I can't do any
cantrips as a bonus action, can I?

00:47:42.822 --> 00:47:45.275
SAM: You do have one bonus action spell.

00:47:45.275 --> 00:47:46.638
MARY: Which is?

00:47:46.638 --> 00:47:48.276
SAM: Misty Step.

00:47:48.276 --> 00:47:50.126
MARY: Yes, but I don't want to use that now.

00:47:50.126 --> 00:47:56.720
LIAM: And in Matt's world and homebrew, bonus
action, you can use a cantrip on, right? Since I

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:57.855
don't do spells a lot.

00:47:57.855 --> 00:48:02.965
SAM: No. But if you really want to, I'll let you,
because I don't care.

00:48:02.965 --> 00:48:04.766
(laughter)

00:48:04.766 --> 00:48:06.566
SAM: Sure, why not.

00:48:06.566 --> 00:48:08.161
MARY: Then I cast Firebolt!

00:48:08.161 --> 00:48:09.730
SAM: Firebolt. At whom?

00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:11.393
MARY: At this lovely cat!

00:48:11.393 --> 00:48:15.938
SAM: All right. This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a ranged spell. You roll
for your attack.

00:48:15.938 --> 00:48:18.175
BRIAN: You're doing great, Sam.

00:48:18.175 --> 00:48:19.449
SAM: I am &lt;i&gt;doing&lt;/i&gt;.

00:48:19.449 --> 00:48:22.061
MARY: I'm going to use Tides of Chaos.

00:48:22.061 --> 00:48:29.087
SAM: Tides of Chaos? Yeah, I hear you. Tides of
Chaos is a sorcerer feature.

00:48:29.087 --> 00:48:31.520
MARY: Do I add anything to that?

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:34.094
SAM: Yeah, plus six. That's your spell attack
bonus.

00:48:34.094 --> 00:48:35.822
MARY: Yes. So 18.

00:48:35.822 --> 00:48:39.949
SAM: 18. This is versus an armor class, I
believe.

00:48:39.949 --> 00:48:42.199
MARY: Which is 19, so I miss &lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt;.

00:48:42.199 --> 00:48:44.508
ASHLY: Eat it, magic!

00:48:44.508 --> 00:48:47.343
MARY: But I did roll Tides of the Chaos.

00:48:47.343 --> 00:48:49.323
SAM: You did. Which gives you advantage.

00:48:49.323 --> 00:48:51.037
MARY: I did, and that was it.

00:48:51.037 --> 00:49:01.115
SAM: Fuck! This tabaxi is tough. So you take a
deep breath, Mary, Gryffin, and you say, "Oh, I'm

00:49:01.115 --> 00:49:05.778
"going to get you this time!" And you cast another
spell, which, again-- a tingling sensation passes

00:49:05.778 --> 00:49:09.571
over your face, as the tabaxi shakes it off.
Nothing happened.

00:49:09.571 --> 00:49:12.054
ASHLY: That was a nice tickle. Thanks, Gryffin!

00:49:12.054 --> 00:49:14.434
SAM: You still have movement, if you'd like to
make it.

00:49:14.434 --> 00:49:15.936
MARY: Yes, I'd like to move behind the bar.

00:49:15.936 --> 00:49:17.148
SAM: Okay.

00:49:17.148 --> 00:49:20.494
BRIAN: Did you need a tickle? Did I hear you
wanted to be tickled?

00:49:20.494 --> 00:49:22.149
ASHLY: Kingston, not now!

00:49:22.149 --> 00:49:24.476
SAM: You're going to move over here?

00:49:24.476 --> 00:49:26.260
MARY: Can I go behind the bar?

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:28.734
SAM: Oh! Sure. Oh, let's see, what's your
movement?

00:49:28.734 --> 00:49:30.018
MARY: 30.

00:49:30.018 --> 00:49:37.362
SAM: Okay, yeah. Then you can make it right there.
And as you go, Clothesline gets an attack of

00:49:37.362 --> 00:49:42.258
opportunity. Not a clothesline attack, because
that takes movement, but other things you can do.

00:49:42.258 --> 00:49:43.734
ASHLY: Okay. I can claw her again?

00:49:43.734 --> 00:49:46.248
SAM: You can claw her again. Roll for an attack.

00:49:46.248 --> 00:49:52.040
ASHLY: I forgot how to play DND. It is a nine.

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.886
BRIAN: Can I inspire her? On her attack?

00:49:54.886 --> 00:50:00.258
SAM: No, you have to do that before. Inspire, you
can't use a reaction. What did you say?

00:50:00.258 --> 00:50:03.949
ASHLY: I got a four on my d20. Don't work.

00:50:03.949 --> 00:50:09.407
SAM: Yes, no, absolutely not. Clothesline takes a
swipe and only just gets a little shock of blonde

00:50:09.407 --> 00:50:10.953
hair in her claws.

00:50:10.953 --> 00:50:12.798
MARY: Sorry, kitty-kitty-kitty!

00:50:12.798 --> 00:50:18.655
SAM: Ooh. They're already so feisty against each
other! I love it! And you get away safely. Next

00:50:18.655 --> 00:50:26.479
up, everyone in the bar turns to see that there is
some fighting going on. Many patrons of the bar

00:50:26.479 --> 00:50:32.965
who are regulars just sort of say: "Shit!" and
don't really react very much. There're some

00:50:32.965 --> 00:50:38.446
newbies in the bar who are on edge, they start
moving around; there's a hustle and bustle, they

00:50:38.446 --> 00:50:44.033
start going across the bar to get their weapons.
Let's say that this fine young cannibal over here

00:50:44.033 --> 00:50:45.880
starts moving to get her weapons.

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.629
BRIAN: Is that where they are?

00:50:47.629 --> 00:50:53.318
SAM: The weapons are over here near the front
door. And let's say that this gentleman moves over

00:50:53.318 --> 00:51:01.857
to the front door to grab his weapon. Let's see
here, that takes care of... so she's done. Who's

00:51:01.857 --> 00:51:09.986
three? No one goes third. What the fuck? There's
no three. All right, so we go straight to four.

00:51:09.986 --> 00:51:16.906
She doesn't do anything, she's just moving. Okay.
Jayne-- No, that's not true. Yes, it is! Jayne,

00:51:16.906 --> 00:51:20.069
you are up. It is your turn to act and strike.

00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:26.687
LIAM: Okay. So I cast the spell Command, which has
a range of 60 feet, on the little red-haired girl.

00:51:26.687 --> 00:51:32.118
And I will say: Approach. And she has to make a
wisdom saving throw.

00:51:32.118 --> 00:51:37.560
SAM: Oh snap! On the little girl? On Holly, the
little girl? Who hasn't said a thing or done a

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:38.760
thing to you yet?

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.077
BRIAN: That's the one that came in with you?

00:51:40.077 --> 00:51:41.165
ERIC: Damn it! Yes.

00:51:41.165 --> 00:51:42.297
SAM: Yes, the two dwarves.

00:51:42.297 --> 00:51:47.374
LIAM: She has to beat a 14. Wisdom.

00:51:47.374 --> 00:51:52.887
SAM: Let me find her. On a what save?

00:51:52.887 --> 00:51:54.285
LIAM: Wisdom.

00:51:54.285 --> 00:52:00.722
SAM: What did you say she has to beat?

00:52:00.722 --> 00:52:01.916
LIAM: 14.

00:52:01.916 --> 00:52:06.020
SAM: She does not beat 14. So what are the effects
of this spell?

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:09.929
LIAM: Approach means she has to come toward me on
her turn.

00:52:09.929 --> 00:52:11.072
SAM: On her next move?

00:52:11.072 --> 00:52:15.722
LIAM: On her every turn, until the spell gets
interrupted. And then I would like to use my

00:52:15.722 --> 00:52:18.715
movement to start moving toward the door as far as
I can get.

00:52:18.715 --> 00:52:21.308
SAM: All right. How fast can you move?

00:52:21.308 --> 00:52:27.788
LIAM: 30 feet. So five, ten. It's crowded. You
could probably slow it down a little bit.

00:52:27.788 --> 00:52:34.220
SAM: Yeah, you had to get up, you had to walk over
there. Let's say you get about this far, near the

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:38.922
dog. And the little girl is right here. She hasn't
moved yet, but on her turn she will.

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:43.054
LIAM: And before all that happened and people were
running to what? To grab their weapons to be part

00:52:43.054 --> 00:52:45.173
of this bloodbath?

00:52:45.173 --> 00:52:46.888
SAM: To defend themselves if needed.

00:52:46.888 --> 00:52:49.549
LIAM: Yes. Does anyone have a hand on a weapon
yet?

00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:53.370
SAM: Absolutely. The guard right here has drawn
his sword.

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:54.973
LIAM: Yes. What about by the door?

00:52:54.973 --> 00:53:02.435
SAM: By the door? This guy has been guarding the
weapons, and he holds a longsword, and he had it

00:53:02.435 --> 00:53:08.670
already readied before the fighting even started.
He's a paid hired hand to guard the door.

00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:14.494
LIAM: Then I'm just going to use my bonus action
to yank the belt off of me, which is actually a

00:53:14.494 --> 00:53:17.170
white whip, and crack it on the floor, and that's
the end of my turn.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:20.050
SAM: Does that do something?

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:22.499
LIAM: Just flair, baby.

00:53:22.499 --> 00:53:24.771
(laughter)

00:53:24.771 --> 00:53:34.405
SAM: Oh snap! Okay, that ends your turn, Jayne.
Okay, who is next? Okay. Valerie, the bartender,

00:53:34.405 --> 00:53:42.002
does not like this, and she does not like someone
coming behind her bar. So she is going to move

00:53:42.002 --> 00:53:52.654
over and attack Gryffin. Let's see what she's got.
She's not armed, currently, so she is going to

00:53:52.654 --> 00:54:00.574
roll a punch attack. That's an 18. Does that hit?

00:54:00.574 --> 00:54:01.675
MARY: It does.

00:54:01.675 --> 00:54:10.957
SAM: Okay. She's not a martial weapon person; I
think that's one point of damage. She smacks you

00:54:10.957 --> 00:54:14.663
in the face and says: "Don't come back here! This
is the bar!"

00:54:14.663 --> 00:54:22.181
MARY: Gryffin's eye starts to twitch a little bit
as she feels things welling up inside of her.

00:54:22.181 --> 00:54:31.120
SAM: Oh boy. It's not going great for you. Let's
see here, who is next? Five, that's six, seven.

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:38.037
Seven, who is seven? Why did I write two sixes?
Clothesline! It is your turn.

00:54:38.037 --> 00:54:39.834
ASHLY: What's up? Okay. Where am I?

00:54:39.834 --> 00:54:45.260
SAM: You're right over here. You just made a swipe
attack on Gryffin as she left. You're near

00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:54.240
Kingston, and you saw Jayne get up and walk away
after she gave you the signal.

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:57.486
ASHLY: Okay. And Frankfurt is adjacent to me as
well, right?

00:54:57.486 --> 00:55:03.380
SAM: Frankfurt is pretty close to you, yeah. He's
instinctively put his hand on his weapon, and his

00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:08.031
other hand is starting to clutch the girl's arm,
the girl Holly.

00:55:08.031 --> 00:55:09.817
ERIC: That's my cargo.

00:55:09.817 --> 00:55:11.102
BRIAN: What is his weapon?

00:55:11.102 --> 00:55:12.452
SAM: What is your weapon?

00:55:12.452 --> 00:55:13.799
ERIC: Hot dog buns.

00:55:13.799 --> 00:55:18.591
BRIAN: That could be brought down with some
water.

00:55:18.591 --> 00:55:21.363
ERIC: My buns!

00:55:21.363 --> 00:55:26.150
ASHLY: Okay. I'm going to attack this guard with
his sword drawn.

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:33.814
SAM: Okay. So you're going to move over here,
yeah? 15 feet of movement or something. And you

00:55:33.814 --> 00:55:35.216
attack with what?

00:55:35.216 --> 00:55:39.234
ASHLY: I want to clothesline him.

00:55:39.234 --> 00:55:42.136
SAM: Sure. Yeah. So you've used ten feet of
movement.

00:55:42.136 --> 00:55:47.198
ASHLY: 18. The lesson there is I should only try
to clothesline people.

00:55:47.198 --> 00:55:54.415
SAM: That is a definite hit. So the tabaxi runs,
full sprint, ten feet across, holding her arm out

00:55:54.415 --> 00:56:00.914
in a clothesline motion and makes a huge impact
with the guy's neck. Roll for damage.

00:56:00.914 --> 00:56:02.159
ASHLY: That's a five.

00:56:02.159 --> 00:56:03.953
SAM: Five damage, okay.

00:56:03.953 --> 00:56:05.340
BRIAN: Well done!

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:07.207
ASHLY: You're next, man!

00:56:07.207 --> 00:56:09.915
BRIAN: Bring it to me, hard and fast!

00:56:09.915 --> 00:56:16.878
SAM: So the guard is a regular, and he looks up at
you and says, "What the hell, Clothesline?"

00:56:16.878 --> 00:56:18.752
ASHLY: I'm sorry, man!

00:56:18.752 --> 00:56:22.545
SAM: Would you like to do anything on your bonus
action? Is there anything?

00:56:22.545 --> 00:56:31.820
ASHLY: Who else has swords drawn? This other guy,
right?

00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:39.620
SAM: Which guy? This orc guy? Yeah, this half-orc
guy, let's say he's got something. What does he

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:44.380
have? Nope, nope, he doesn't have any weapons. I
wrote it down that way, so that's how it is.

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:48.481
ASHLY: I'm going to jump on the table and go
(snarls) to make things feel crazier.

00:56:48.481 --> 00:56:57.223
SAM: Okay. So you do a catlike roar on the table.
(hisses) The four or five people near you look up

00:56:57.223 --> 00:57:05.884
at you, totally baffled at what the fuck is going
on right now. One guy, who is a regular, grabs his

00:57:05.884 --> 00:57:12.572
drink and sips it; he doesn't give a shit. Okay.
Next up. That was Clothesline. Next is Kingston's

00:57:12.572 --> 00:57:16.753
turn! Kingston. What would you like to do. Oh,
Kingston! Kingston is over here, sorry.

00:57:16.753 --> 00:57:20.650
BRIAN: Actually, he rolled higher than me. For
initiative? I'm three.

00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:27.484
SAM: Oh, I wrote down 13 for Kingston and three
for Frankfurt, but it's the opposite? So 13 for

00:57:27.484 --> 00:57:30.693
Frankfurt, three for Kingston. Sorry about that.

00:57:30.693 --> 00:57:31.898
ERIC: It's okay.

00:57:31.898 --> 00:57:34.123
LIAM: How many shows are you directing right now?
72?

00:57:34.123 --> 00:57:42.571
SAM: All of them. Okay, sorry. Sorry. I get you
guys confused because of your stupid names. So

00:57:42.571 --> 00:57:51.605
Frankfurt, it is &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; turn. There is chaos all
around you, the girl is sitting there harmlessly.

00:57:51.605 --> 00:57:55.942
She's a little frightened, but there's a lot of
action; lot of movement.

00:57:55.942 --> 00:58:05.994
ERIC: I mean, I have a feeling that Kingston knows
what I did to his wife. With his wife.

00:58:05.994 --> 00:58:08.317
SAM: On his wife.

00:58:08.317 --> 00:58:13.839
ERIC: Last summer. I feel like I might try to
start some shit with Kingston.

00:58:13.839 --> 00:58:22.138
SAM: Okay. So seeing his opportunity, Frankfurt
leaves the side of the little girl and runs across

00:58:22.138 --> 00:58:25.588
the room, using your awesome dwarf speed. How fast
can you move?

00:58:25.588 --> 00:58:26.689
ERIC: 25.

00:58:26.689 --> 00:58:28.725
SAM: 25. This is you, the gold guy, by the way,
Eric.

00:58:28.725 --> 00:58:31.983
ERIC: But is Obby still protecting her?

00:58:31.983 --> 00:58:38.281
SAM: Obby is still protecting her. I will say she
was sitting in between you two. Obby is calm. So

00:58:38.281 --> 00:58:41.992
you go over, and you attack. Are you doing a
weapon attack?

00:58:41.992 --> 00:58:44.197
ERIC: I'm going to use my maul.

00:58:44.197 --> 00:58:48.263
SAM: So roll a d20 and add your plus something to
it.

00:58:48.263 --> 00:58:55.147
ERIC: Okay. I'm rolling. 18.

00:58:55.147 --> 00:59:01.261
SAM: 18? I'm sure that hits you, right, dude?
Wait, you &lt;i&gt;rolled&lt;/i&gt; an 18?

00:59:01.261 --> 00:59:02.436
ERIC: I rolled an 18.

00:59:02.436 --> 00:59:03.755
BRIAN: Wait, is that a melee attack?

00:59:03.755 --> 00:59:08.093
SAM: Yeah, he hits you. Yeah. So roll for damage.

00:59:08.093 --> 00:59:12.634
ERIC: Oh! And that's this one?

00:59:12.634 --> 00:59:23.218
SAM: What does it say? Hold on. Your maul is 2d6
plus six! This is a big, fat weapon. Two-handed

00:59:23.218 --> 00:59:31.911
strike comes down right on the top of your head.
Full force. This guy is a bruiser. So roll 2d6. Or

00:59:31.911 --> 00:59:33.754
1d6 twice.

00:59:33.754 --> 00:59:36.793
LIAM: Is this the maul? That's six two times.

00:59:36.793 --> 00:59:38.293
ERIC: Okay. So this one?

00:59:38.293 --> 00:59:45.321
LIAM: The square. Traditional die. And one more
time. A six!

00:59:45.321 --> 00:59:47.660
SAM: Oh my god! You're fucking dead, dude.

00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:50.048
LIAM: Two, that's eight, plus six.

00:59:50.048 --> 00:59:56.535
SAM: 14 points of damage. Kingston, still reeling
from getting dissed by several ladies tonight,

00:59:56.535 --> 01:00:02.836
didn't really even look, and all of a sudden a
maul cracks down on his skull, sending him to his

01:00:02.836 --> 01:00:09.270
knees. Are you okay? Kingston is not doing great.

01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:11.446
ERIC: No hard feelings.

01:00:11.446 --> 01:00:17.370
BRIAN: Just you wait. When I get up from this
ground!

01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:26.422
SAM: Because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing:
on your knees, Kingston-- by the way, sorry. Would

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:31.919
you like to use any bonus actions, Mr. Frankfurt?
You don't have to.

01:00:31.919 --> 01:00:37.624
LIAM: Your Hunter's Mark is a bonus action, I seem
to recall.

01:00:37.624 --> 01:00:43.400
SAM: You could have used before, or you could
put it on somebody else. Also, forgive me.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:50.136
Hunter's Mark, he has something similar that is a
paladin feature, I think, that doesn't use a spell

01:00:50.136 --> 01:00:52.219
slot. Vow of Enmity, is that a thing?

01:00:52.219 --> 01:00:58.573
LIAM: That's big time. Yeah, that gives him
advantage on every attack against one target. So

01:00:58.573 --> 01:01:04.127
if you really want to fuck that guy up, do Vow of
Enmity. But I think that's an action.

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:05.672
SAM: I don't know.

01:01:05.672 --> 01:01:13.104
ERIC: It sounds a bit too complicated. I'm a
little satisfied with what I did just now.

01:01:13.104 --> 01:01:14.239
BRIAN: Yeah.

01:01:14.239 --> 01:01:15.320
SAM: You're satisfied?

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.220
ERIC: Yeah.

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.625
BRIAN: My wife wasn't satisfied!

01:01:18.625 --> 01:01:20.182
SAM: Oh shit!

01:01:20.182 --> 01:01:28.826
ERIC: I've got video. Do I stay in that area?

01:01:28.826 --> 01:01:32.989
SAM: You can move a little bit. I think you have
five or ten more feet of movement.

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:36.614
ERIC: Head back towards Holly.

01:01:36.614 --> 01:01:44.103
LIAM: Vow of Enmity, bonus action. If you want to
destroy Kingston. It gives you advantage. Vow of

01:01:44.103 --> 01:01:50.362
Enmity. One time tonight you can say, that person,
and then you can roll with burning hatred.

01:01:50.362 --> 01:01:55.707
Religious hatred. You know, the religious hatred.

01:01:55.707 --> 01:02:08.090
SAM: So keep that in your back pocket. Frankfurt
goes back towards the girl, keeping her protected

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:24.104
from badness. That was Frankfurt. At this point,
the old bald man who was arguing with the whore

01:02:24.104 --> 01:02:38.369
uses this as an opportunity to flee, and starts
running for the door. He's moving this way. Zarvah

01:02:38.369 --> 01:02:42.496
the whore sees this happening and starts bolting
to catch him.

01:02:42.496 --> 01:02:44.892
BRIAN: Don't leave!

01:02:44.892 --> 01:02:50.513
MARY: All the plants will die!

01:02:50.513 --> 01:02:52.857
BRIAN: I'm going to be done with this so soon.

01:02:52.857 --> 01:03:01.339
SAM: This guy over here, who was eating mutton
before. He's got his weapon now and he turns to

01:03:01.339 --> 01:03:07.731
anyone who's available to him, which is the
easiest target in the area, which is Jayne, a

01:03:07.731 --> 01:03:13.413
small girl. Mutton Man has--

01:03:13.413 --> 01:03:17.680
LIAM: Do you know the Mutton Man?

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:24.955
SAM: He sees you running for the door; he thinks
this is fun. This is his favorite thing, is bar

01:03:24.955 --> 01:03:38.880
room brawls. He is going to roll a 14 plus five,
19 versus strength. No, he's trying to grapple you.

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.248
LIAM: Versus strength. Oh, that does it.

01:03:42.248 --> 01:03:49.301
SAM: You are grappled by the Mutton Man. He grabs you
and says, "Not so fast, dear, we're going to have

01:03:49.301 --> 01:03:55.623
"some fun tonight." You are restrained for right
now. You cannot move.

01:03:55.623 --> 01:03:57.747
BRIAN: Do you know that Muffin Man?

01:03:57.747 --> 01:04:00.120
MARY and ASHLY: (singing) Do you know the muffin
man?

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:06.008
SAM: So you are grappled. Ooh! I have a thing! You
are grappled!

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:11.047
(cheering)

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:13.418
LIAM: It matches my albino, even!

01:04:13.418 --> 01:04:21.013
SAM: That's the Mutton Man. Now we go to Kingston.
Kingston, before your roll, you have dropped to

01:04:21.013 --> 01:04:27.345
your knees. You are feeling like shit. You open
your eyes; roll a perception check.

01:04:27.345 --> 01:04:37.497
BRIAN: Don't fuck me, Gil. I can't tell what it
is. 12?

01:04:37.497 --> 01:04:44.732
SAM: 12, okay. You see the table in front of you;
you've fallen facing the table. Under the table in

01:04:44.732 --> 01:04:47.933
front of you is a small vial of something
underneath it.

01:04:47.933 --> 01:04:49.467
BRIAN: I grab the fuck out of it.

01:04:49.467 --> 01:04:59.497
SAM: That is going to take some of your movement.
You could grab it; that's fine. You grab it. I got

01:04:59.497 --> 01:05:09.890
stuff. I got presents. Let's do this, because I'm
a kind god. (laughing) You recognize one of these;

01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:15.674
you've seen them before: it's a potion of healing.
Someone must have dropped it in the scrum, so it's

01:05:15.674 --> 01:05:18.735
there for you if you need it. What would you like
to do on your action?

01:05:18.735 --> 01:05:24.896
BRIAN: Is standing up going to take my movement?
Half my movement? Okay. I'll stand up and then

01:05:24.896 --> 01:05:27.337
where is Frankfurt?

01:05:27.337 --> 01:05:29.701
SAM: Frankfurt is pretty close to you.

01:05:29.701 --> 01:05:31.803
BRIAN: Okay, I'm going to cast Blindness on
Frankfurt.

01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:36.276
SAM: Blindness? Okay, what is your spell save DC?

01:05:36.276 --> 01:05:40.299
BRIAN: That way he thinks he's going home with
someone's wife, but he's going home with someone's

01:05:40.299 --> 01:05:45.824
mule. My spell save DC is a 14.

01:05:45.824 --> 01:05:50.265
SAM: 14. Is Blindness a constitution or wisdom
save?

01:05:50.265 --> 01:05:52.511
BRIAN: It is a constitution save.

01:05:52.511 --> 01:05:57.752
SAM: So Eric, you need to roll a d20 and add your
constitution save modifier, which Liam will point

01:05:57.752 --> 01:06:00.978
out to you right now. Constitution save.

01:06:00.978 --> 01:06:03.778
LIAM: Constitution save is right here. Plus four
to whatever you roll.

01:06:03.778 --> 01:06:05.393
SAM: So roll something.

01:06:05.393 --> 01:06:09.226
ERIC: Now hold on a minute. I love vision.

01:06:09.226 --> 01:06:12.261
LIAM: Oh yeah, 20.

01:06:12.261 --> 01:06:19.447
SAM: 20. A prickling in your neck, Frankfurt, as
you feel some sort of magical effect starting to

01:06:19.447 --> 01:06:24.665
take hold but you burp and shake it off like
nothing happened.

01:06:24.665 --> 01:06:30.279
ERIC: (burps, laughs) I've never played before.

01:06:30.279 --> 01:06:33.052
BRIAN: You're doing great.

01:06:33.052 --> 01:06:35.946
SAM: Kingston, you still have a bonus action.

01:06:35.946 --> 01:06:38.046
BRIAN: I'll take this potion as my bonus action.

01:06:38.046 --> 01:06:41.379
SAM: Okay. It's a 2d4 plus what?

01:06:41.379 --> 01:06:43.428
BRIAN: 4d4 plus four.

01:06:43.428 --> 01:06:46.044
MARY: It's a greater healing.

01:06:46.044 --> 01:06:48.973
SAM: Yeah. Well, I don't want him to die already.

01:06:48.973 --> 01:07:06.939
BRIAN: Getting pretty close there for a second.
All right. 4d4. 14. Yeah, not bad. 11 plus four so 15.

01:07:07.036 --> 01:07:21.240
SAM: All right. Lucky. All right, so that takes
care of all you guys, I think. The half-orc who

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:26.487
you did not attack sees you on the bar, sees that
it's going to be fun, and is going to try to pull

01:07:26.487 --> 01:07:39.333
you down off the bar. He will roll a 14 plus
something. I don't know what. Just a 14. I'm going

01:07:39.333 --> 01:07:45.938
to say straight 14. No, this would be a strength
check. He's pretty strong so I'm going to add four

01:07:45.938 --> 01:07:52.372
to that? 18 versus strength. Strength save. 20
plus your strength.

01:07:52.372 --> 01:07:55.164
ASHLY: (singing) Critical roll symbol, so natural
20.

01:07:55.164 --> 01:08:03.547
SAM: Holy shit! So the half-orc grabs for your
catlike ankles and you see the grab coming, and

01:08:03.547 --> 01:08:11.085
you kick your half-drunk saucer of milk right in
his face. He's distracted and gets a whiff of air;

01:08:11.085 --> 01:08:19.904
doesn't grab any fur or anything. That ends his
turn. Anybody else? Okay. There's one other person

01:08:19.904 --> 01:08:28.335
who moves, and she's picking up a weapon. That is
the top of the round-- Oh no! Obby the dwarf. Obby

01:08:28.335 --> 01:08:35.324
the Rat. Okay, Obby is going to go across to the
girl, take a couple steps closer to the girl

01:08:35.324 --> 01:08:41.072
because that's what he's being paid here for. Grab
her by the arm and hold his action until someone

01:08:41.072 --> 01:08:43.119
tries to attack the girl.

01:08:43.119 --> 01:08:44.384
ASHLY: Does Holly move?

01:08:44.384 --> 01:08:50.180
SAM: Holly can move. Shit, I never rolled for
initiative for Holly! Okay, so she should have

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:55.043
gone a while ago. Fuck! Let's just say she was so
confused she's only going now.

01:08:55.043 --> 01:08:58.409
BRIAN: Can you describe to me what she's wearing
and if she's carrying anything?

01:08:58.409 --> 01:09:06.186
SAM: Holly is wearing a simple gray raw silk tunic
with a belt around it. She is-- let me see,

01:09:06.186 --> 01:09:15.917
where's her fucking stats? She is not holding
anything at all except for, let's say for dramatic

01:09:15.917 --> 01:09:23.031
effect, she has a tiny something in her hand that
looks like a charm bracelet or something that a

01:09:23.031 --> 01:09:30.101
young girl might have, like a hair tie with some
charms dangling from it or something. That's it.

01:09:30.101 --> 01:09:37.472
And she starts to move, right? That's what happens
with this thing, right? She comes towards you and

01:09:37.472 --> 01:09:45.767
her movement is &lt;i&gt;fast&lt;/i&gt;. So she comes right over
and stops at your feet, looks up at you with puppy

01:09:45.767 --> 01:09:51.539
dog eyes as if to say: who are you and where are
we going? And that concludes her turn.

01:09:51.539 --> 01:09:54.654
LIAM: I barely notice because someone from the
Jersey Shore is lifting me into the air.

01:09:54.654 --> 01:10:01.336
SAM: That's the top of the round. Holy shit, I'm
running a game of Dungeons and Dragons!

01:10:01.336 --> 01:10:03.999
(cheering)

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:06.227
ASHLY: You're doing a hell of a job!

01:10:06.227 --> 01:10:07.651
BRIAN: You're doing great.

01:10:07.651 --> 01:10:15.676
SAM: As the fight continues, time freezes. Our
vision dims. Flashes to another time, another

01:10:15.676 --> 01:10:21.754
place. It's blurry at first. Then, coming slowly
into focus is a dimly lit room, a simple table and

01:10:21.754 --> 01:10:26.971
chair in the center. From this perspective, only
the person in the chair can be seen. There is an

01:10:26.971 --> 01:10:32.540
off-stage voice: that of a gruff man, asking
questions, but we never see him. It is, by all

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:42.478
appearances, an interrogation. In the chair sits
Gryffin. The gruff voice says: "Uh-huh. And why

01:10:42.478 --> 01:10:45.870
"were you there? At the bar?"

01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:58.261
MARY: Well, I'd come to speak to Frankfurt.
Frankfurt had told me to meet him there because he

01:10:58.261 --> 01:11:04.095
was transporting someone that I needed to speak to
very badly--

01:11:04.095 --> 01:11:06.706
SAM: "This girl that you keep talking about,
right?"

01:11:06.706 --> 01:11:09.171
MARY: Yes, Holly, the girl. I needed to speak with
her.

01:11:09.171 --> 01:11:12.945
SAM: "Why? What could a little fucking girl have
that you needed?"

01:11:12.945 --> 01:11:16.143
MARY: I'm not supposed to be here!

01:11:16.143 --> 01:11:19.562
SAM: "Well, you're not going anywhere, honey."

01:11:19.562 --> 01:11:30.526
MARY: No, I mean, not here, in this chair. I mean
&lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt;! I come from Illyria, and the solar eclipse

01:11:30.526 --> 01:11:35.510
a week and a half ago placed us in this
wherever-the-hell we are, Jorell, I'm not sure

01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:41.696
where we are, right? And my city appears during
the solar eclipse, during the period of totality.

01:11:41.696 --> 01:11:53.622
So out I come. I was pushed out of my city, and I
woke up here. My city was gone. This girl, Holly,

01:11:53.622 --> 01:11:59.688
potentially could be from Illyria. I need to find
her so that I can find the location of where

01:11:59.688 --> 01:12:06.339
Illyria will reappear next. That's why I'm here! I
certainly didn't mean to start a fight with the

01:12:06.339 --> 01:12:09.496
cat, nor did I certainly mean to declaw her!

01:12:09.496 --> 01:12:15.373
SAM: "Are you some sort of royalty or something?
You talk real funny."

01:12:15.373 --> 01:12:20.724
MARY: Well. Yes, my mother was a queen and I was a
princess, yes.

01:12:20.724 --> 01:12:22.570
SAM: "Are you shitting me?"

01:12:22.570 --> 01:12:26.913
MARY: I have Prestidigitation. If you do shit
yourself I could clean you up?

01:12:26.913 --> 01:12:28.483
SAM: "Don't even think about it, honey."

01:12:28.483 --> 01:12:35.344
MARY: I never would. But yes, my queen, my
mother-- but she's no longer alive.

01:12:35.344 --> 01:12:45.572
SAM: Time shifts again. Same room, different time.
Now in the hot seat is Kingston, looking very

01:12:45.572 --> 01:12:59.566
confused. Eyes red, hungover, woozy, dazey. "So
this guy, he slept with your wife?"

01:12:59.566 --> 01:13:03.513
BRIAN: I mean, I'm pretty sure they fucked first.

01:13:03.513 --> 01:13:08.007
(laughter)

01:13:08.007 --> 01:13:11.936
SAM: "And that's all the beef there was between
you two?"

01:13:11.936 --> 01:13:16.809
BRIAN: That's all the beef there was in my house
that night, and there wasn't any beef in there for

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:18.743
a long time after.

01:13:18.743 --> 01:13:21.104
SAM: "What were you even doing in this bar?"

01:13:21.104 --> 01:13:27.441
BRIAN: I live above the bar. I have an extensive
tab.

01:13:27.441 --> 01:13:30.456
SAM: "But they let you live there?"

01:13:30.456 --> 01:13:40.485
BRIAN: I perform certain services in exchange for
drinks and board.

01:13:40.485 --> 01:13:47.190
SAM: "What does that mean? You sweep up after the
night is over?"

01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:53.584
BRIAN: If you mean I'm a male prostitute, then
yeah. I sweep up all of the elderly women at the

01:13:53.584 --> 01:14:00.246
end of the night. I take them upstairs, and I show
them a good time, and in exchange I get all the

01:14:00.246 --> 01:14:08.023
Greep and ale I want. Even the elderly of this
great land deserve to capture the flag every once

01:14:08.023 --> 01:14:09.512
in a while.

01:14:09.512 --> 01:14:12.565
MARY: (laughing) Why did you look at me?

01:14:12.565 --> 01:14:15.768
BRIAN: I was hoping you would tell me the rest of
what I was going to say.

01:14:15.768 --> 01:14:22.797
SAM: "So &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, freaky-looking guy, are a male
prostitute?"

01:14:22.797 --> 01:14:33.076
BRIAN: Look, some of these elderly ladies, they
like their men with their make-up runny. But yes,

01:14:33.076 --> 01:14:38.564
in exchange for room and board, I will often
pleasure these women deep into the night.

01:14:38.564 --> 01:14:40.852
SAM: "I don't need the details, buddy."

01:14:40.852 --> 01:14:43.506
BRIAN: Oh, you haven't even scratched the surface
of the details.

01:14:43.506 --> 01:14:45.261
SAM: "Please, spare me."

01:14:45.261 --> 01:14:48.960
BRIAN: Okay. When the wigs come off--

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:56.185
SAM: Time shifts again. Now Clothesline, looking
surly and pissy, is in the hot seat.

01:14:56.185 --> 01:15:00.438
"What's with your face?"

01:15:00.438 --> 01:15:02.267
ASHLY: What's with yours, bastard?

01:15:02.267 --> 01:15:11.144
SAM: "Fair enough. The white-haired girl: what's
her deal? Did you know her?"

01:15:11.144 --> 01:15:12.613
ASHLY: Maybe.

01:15:12.613 --> 01:15:14.600
SAM: "Maybe what?"

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:16.848
ASHLY: What are you going to do if I don't answer
you?

01:15:16.848 --> 01:15:19.441
SAM: "Put you in jail."

01:15:19.441 --> 01:15:21.481
ASHLY: (growls) Yeah, I know her.

01:15:21.481 --> 01:15:23.163
SAM: "How?"

01:15:23.163 --> 01:15:29.253
ASHLY: She saved me once, all right? I was dying.
I don't know. I have almost died like 20 times, I

01:15:29.253 --> 01:15:35.681
don't keep track, okay? But this one time I was
almost going to &lt;i&gt;really die&lt;/i&gt;, and she saved me.

01:15:35.681 --> 01:15:38.929
She helped me. Only person that's ever really done
that.

01:15:38.929 --> 01:15:41.761
SAM: "You would do anything for her?"

01:15:41.761 --> 01:15:48.120
ASHLY: Not anything. But I'd help her out, yeah.
Someone does you a good turn, you do it back.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:50.346
SAM: "Were you helping her this night?"

01:15:50.346 --> 01:16:01.177
ASHLY: (sighs) She wanted me to make a
distraction. I don't know why, so don't ask. So I

01:16:01.177 --> 01:16:06.831
took a little skin off the creepy girl. There were
a couple creepy girls: the one with the weird eyes.

01:16:06.831 --> 01:16:11.152
SAM: "I just want to get this down: you are
admitting that you started the fight in the tavern?"

01:16:11.152 --> 01:16:12.969
ASHLY: Yeah.

01:16:12.969 --> 01:16:16.882
SAM: "All right. Thank you for your honesty."

01:16:16.882 --> 01:16:18.486
ASHLY: You're welcome.

01:16:18.486 --> 01:16:22.800
SAM: "Hey, where did you get that name, anyway?
Clothesline? Do you have another alias, anything else?"

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:30.117
ASHLY: Where I'm from, they give you a nickname
for the thing you like to do the most. I love to

01:16:30.117 --> 01:16:33.876
clothesline. There were a lot of "Porns" in the
town; it was kind of confusing.

01:16:33.876 --> 01:16:35.596
SAM: "A lot of 'Porns?'"

01:16:35.596 --> 01:16:39.455
ASHLY: Yeah. A lot of people's favorite thing is
porn. You talk to many people?

01:16:39.455 --> 01:16:44.098
SAM: "Yeah, no. That tracks. That definitely
tracks."

01:16:44.098 --> 01:16:45.957
LIAM: Etchings.

01:16:45.957 --> 01:16:53.801
MARY: Lots of etchings. Brass penis and balls with
wings pointing in certain directions.

01:16:53.801 --> 01:16:59.899
SAM: I don't know how to change music, people. I
don't know. Sorry about this. Time shifts again.

01:16:59.899 --> 01:17:08.802
Now in the hot seat we see Frankfurt, the dwarf.
"All right, this girl that you claim you were

01:17:08.802 --> 01:17:14.393
"there to deliver. Who gave her to you? Where did
you find her? Where did she come from?"

01:17:14.393 --> 01:17:23.439
ERIC: I was told I could have one courier pigeon.
I need to contact my lawyer. Why am I here?

01:17:23.439 --> 01:17:27.330
(laughter)

01:17:27.330 --> 01:17:29.527
SAM: "You'll get your courier pigeon."

01:17:29.527 --> 01:17:35.668
ERIC: Where's Obby? Obby! You've separated me from
my Obby.

01:17:35.668 --> 01:17:37.657
SAM: "Listen."

01:17:37.657 --> 01:17:38.615
ERIC: What?

01:17:38.615 --> 01:17:42.278
SAM: "We're trying to round up Obby right now.
We're aware of where he lives in town."

01:17:42.278 --> 01:17:43.789
ERIC: Where's the girl?

01:17:43.789 --> 01:17:45.711
SAM: "What do you mean, where's the girl?"

01:17:45.711 --> 01:17:51.154
ERIC: Where did you put the girl? I have one thing
to do and that's talk to Garello.

01:17:51.154 --> 01:17:55.167
SAM: "I will be asking the questions here, thank
you very much."

01:17:55.167 --> 01:17:56.590
ERIC: Ugh, I've never played.

01:17:56.590 --> 01:18:00.599
(laughter)

01:18:00.599 --> 01:18:07.783
SAM: "Fine. If you had your courier pigeon, who
would you send it to?"

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:16.035
ERIC: I would send it to (coos, wings
fluttering).

01:18:16.035 --> 01:18:22.888
SAM: "While that is extremely impressive, it
leaves way more questions than answers."

01:18:22.888 --> 01:18:26.170
ERIC: What does a dwarf got to do to get some
Greep around here?

01:18:26.170 --> 01:18:29.352
SAM: "I don't feel like you're taking this
interrogation seriously."

01:18:29.352 --> 01:18:35.405
ERIC: I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt;. Okay, look. I was only told that I
had to transport this girl, Holly.

01:18:35.405 --> 01:18:37.694
SAM: "And what would you get in exchange?"

01:18:37.694 --> 01:18:41.687
ERIC: A couple bucks. 100 gold coins.

01:18:41.687 --> 01:18:43.261
SAM: "100 gold?!"

01:18:43.261 --> 01:18:44.568
ERIC: 100 of them, yes.

01:18:44.568 --> 01:18:46.705
SAM: "For just taking a girl from point A to point
B?"

01:18:46.705 --> 01:18:52.852
ERIC: Look, I do a lot of missions and I don't ask
many questions. I was told to bring her there, and

01:18:52.852 --> 01:19:02.371
I'm told to find the guy or a girl named Garello.
That's all I know. Hey, you seem to know a lot

01:19:02.371 --> 01:19:05.338
about me. Can I ask you something?

01:19:05.338 --> 01:19:06.898
SAM: "Go ahead."

01:19:06.898 --> 01:19:09.575
ERIC: What do you know about this Chained
Oblivion?

01:19:09.575 --> 01:19:15.788
SAM: "I know absolutely nothing about this Chained
Oblivion. It's some sort of fucking religious thing."

01:19:15.788 --> 01:19:19.120
ERIC: Well, I am going to take them down!

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.966
SAM: "Oh."

01:19:20.966 --> 01:19:23.171
ERIC: So if you see anyone from them.

01:19:23.171 --> 01:19:27.792
SAM: "I don't see anyone from them. I've heard
rumors that they exist. Wait, why am I answering

01:19:27.792 --> 01:19:42.500
"any questions?" Time shifts again. Now, we have a
white-haired girl child in the hot seat. "All

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:46.845
"right, tell me your story. Why were you there?
What's a sweet, innocent little sweetheart like

01:19:46.845 --> 01:19:49.843
"you doing in a place like The Ass Sailor?"

01:19:49.843 --> 01:19:53.002
ASHLY: (laughing) I forgot it was called that.

01:19:53.002 --> 01:19:59.986
LIAM: (soft giggling)

01:19:59.986 --> 01:20:02.501
SAM: "Go on. I'm listening."

01:20:02.501 --> 01:20:07.430
LIAM: Sorry. I was just imagining you burned to a
crisp.

01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:09.827
SAM: "Excuse me?"

01:20:09.827 --> 01:20:11.263
LIAM: Am I bound?

01:20:11.263 --> 01:20:14.522
SAM: Yeah, your hands are tied behind your back.

01:20:14.522 --> 01:20:16.898
LIAM: Hands are tied behind my back. Are they
movable?

01:20:16.898 --> 01:20:18.169
SAM: They're movable.

01:20:18.169 --> 01:20:21.521
LIAM: They are? Then I cast Sacred Flame on the
guy.

01:20:21.521 --> 01:20:26.214
SAM: I don't know what that is.

01:20:26.214 --> 01:20:28.777
LIAM: Oh, it's holy fire for 1d8 damage.

01:20:28.777 --> 01:20:30.182
SAM: Do you roll something?

01:20:30.182 --> 01:20:35.344
LIAM: Yeah. The target must succeed on a dexterity
saving throw.

01:20:35.344 --> 01:20:37.174
BRIAN: Talk about fuck the police.

01:20:37.174 --> 01:20:39.365
LIAM: You make a dex save.

01:20:39.365 --> 01:20:42.420
SAM: What was the number?

01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:45.902
LIAM: 14.

01:20:45.902 --> 01:21:01.465
SAM: Okay. So as we see a burst of flame, right,
you said flames? We see from your eyes, they start

01:21:01.465 --> 01:21:08.981
to glow and burn with a holy light and fire starts
to emanate from your eyes straight towards our

01:21:08.981 --> 01:21:17.808
point of view. We hear a gruff man say: "Ugh. Hey!
What the fuck are you--" and time shifts again.

01:21:17.808 --> 01:21:23.190
(laughter)

01:21:23.190 --> 01:21:27.700
SAM: And we are back in the bar, and it's the top
of the round. Gryffin, it is your roll.

01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:34.137
MARY: I turn to Valerie and I pull out the bag of
gold that I was going to give Frankfurt and I say

01:21:34.137 --> 01:21:38.100
to her: Valerie, I have no intention of doing you
any harm whatsoever. I'm so sorry to invade your

01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:44.218
space back here, but I &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; need to get out of
this place alive. I don't need your help. All I

01:21:44.218 --> 01:21:51.401
need are four bottles of Greep. So here is a bag
of gold. May I have four bottles of Greep, please?

01:21:51.401 --> 01:21:57.165
SAM: "There's a keg right there." It's right here.
It's full of Greep.

01:21:57.165 --> 01:22:01.844
MARY: Okay. Is that something that I could
potentially carry?

01:22:01.844 --> 01:22:05.722
SAM: It's heavy, but you can pick it up. It's a
pony keg.

01:22:05.722 --> 01:22:08.642
MARY: Are there any bottles in my vicinity?

01:22:08.642 --> 01:22:16.067
SAM: There are a bunch of cups over here. Greep is
a pour thing. So you either have a big bottle of

01:22:16.067 --> 01:22:19.755
it or you can use your turn to start filling up
cups of it.

01:22:19.755 --> 01:22:21.985
(laughter)

01:22:21.985 --> 01:22:23.727
MARY: So there are no whiskey bottles or
anything?

01:22:23.727 --> 01:22:26.599
SAM: There are whiskey bottles all over the place
in the back of the bar. They're not filled with

01:22:26.599 --> 01:22:29.370
Greep, though; they've got different other
spirits: whiskey--

01:22:29.370 --> 01:22:31.435
MARY: And there are no empty bottles whatsoever?

01:22:31.435 --> 01:22:37.119
SAM: &lt;i&gt;Empty&lt;/i&gt; bottles? Sure, yeah. They've taken
the used bottles and put them sort of behind the bar.

01:22:37.119 --> 01:22:39.489
MARY: Great. I start filling bottles with Greep.

01:22:39.489 --> 01:22:45.793
SAM: Bottles with Greep? You're going to use your
action to do this? All right. So Valerie, who

01:22:45.793 --> 01:22:50.789
still doesn't really love you behind the bar is
watching you fill up bottles, but she's okay

01:22:50.789 --> 01:22:55.623
because she got a bunch of gold out of it. So
she's allowing it with a sneer. The man right

01:22:55.623 --> 01:23:03.093
behind you, Xavier, really doesn't like this, but
he is a ninny, so he's just like (grumbling).

01:23:03.093 --> 01:23:05.881
MARY: For my bonus action, I toss him ten gold, as
well.

01:23:05.881 --> 01:23:12.315
SAM: Oh, wow! Bonus action gold toss. That's nice.
While you're down there getting these bottles, why

01:23:12.315 --> 01:23:16.464
don't you roll a perception check? (whispering) I
made these and I'm going to use them, fuckers!

01:23:16.464 --> 01:23:25.980
MARY: I haven't used my Tides of Chaos this time.
Perception, though. 13.

01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:33.149
SAM: 13. Yeah, sure. So you see a small box that
has intricate gold leafing around it. Looks out of

01:23:33.149 --> 01:23:40.932
place behind there. It's small, the size of a deck
of cards or something. Oh god! You'll never see

01:23:40.932 --> 01:23:56.080
it. Okay. That's a thing that exists. Okay, next
up. One, two, okay. This whore--

01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:01.702
LIAM: Hey! You've known me for so long!

01:24:01.702 --> 01:24:08.467
SAM: She wants to help out her hooker friend and
catch the old guy who's leaving, so she runs over

01:24:08.467 --> 01:24:25.536
and attacks him. Yep, that hits. I'll roll for
damage. Great, where's he? Okay, so she lunges at

01:24:25.536 --> 01:24:31.557
him and hits him in the back of the head and grabs
onto his pants, which pull them down. He's now

01:24:31.557 --> 01:24:37.796
naked from the waist down. And slightly injured
and he says: "I'm being attacked! I'm being

01:24:37.796 --> 01:24:46.426
"attacked!" Next. Remember, there is no three,
because I never assigned that number. Four. Okay.

01:24:46.426 --> 01:24:52.606
The ranger has found her shit. This is the ranger
right here. She has found her bow and arrow,

01:24:52.606 --> 01:24:58.719
nocked an arrow and she's going to shoot, she
needs some range, so she's going to shoot at the

01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:08.396
most prominent target in the room: the cat thing
on the bar, and she rolled a one. The arrow

01:25:08.396 --> 01:25:15.314
whizzes by your head (arrow impact) right into the
thing behind you. No damage, no nothing. That's

01:25:15.314 --> 01:25:23.431
four, five, next. Jayne, your turn. You are
currently restrained. I think you can do a

01:25:23.431 --> 01:25:25.003
strength check to try to get out of it.

01:25:25.003 --> 01:25:31.162
LIAM: I can attack normally, I just can't move
anywhere. I would like to do a melee spell attack

01:25:31.162 --> 01:25:38.729
on him. So first I'm going to see if it hits then
I'll tell you what it is. That is an 18.

01:25:38.729 --> 01:25:41.551
SAM: An 18? On whom?

01:25:41.551 --> 01:25:43.313
LIAM: On the guy grappling me.

01:25:43.313 --> 01:25:49.415
SAM: Oh yes, for sure. He was the Mutton Man,
right? His AC is 12. You hit.

01:25:49.415 --> 01:25:54.505
LIAM: So I would like to cast Inflict Wounds at
level two and rot this fucking asshole from the

01:25:54.505 --> 01:25:55.876
inside out.

01:25:55.876 --> 01:25:59.096
SAM: Oh my god. I don't know what that is but it
sounds horrifying.

01:25:59.096 --> 01:26:00.573
LIAM: Yeah, it is.

01:26:00.573 --> 01:26:04.240
SAM: "Now, we're going to have some fun-- what the
fuck are you doing?"

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:11.849
LIAM: 18. Good. That is a 25 total.

01:26:11.849 --> 01:26:20.686
SAM: Okay, so with his snarling, disgusting yellow
teeth, he's smiling at you as his whole head from

01:26:20.686 --> 01:26:27.982
top to bottom disintegrates into ash and falls to
the floor in a pile of disgustingness. He's dead

01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:31.246
and gone. You are no longer restrained and can
move at will.

01:26:31.246 --> 01:26:37.288
LIAM: I would like to use my bonus action to break
the fucking Lawbearer chain off my neck and throw

01:26:37.288 --> 01:26:39.447
it over my shoulder and walk towards the door.

01:26:39.447 --> 01:26:41.315
BRIAN: Yeah, fuck that thing!

01:26:41.315 --> 01:26:48.802
SAM: Okay. No longer restrained. You're calmly
walking out like you own the place. No one takes a

01:26:48.802 --> 01:26:55.715
strike against you because you're not involved in
combat with them. Oh, this guy is gone! Splash

01:26:55.715 --> 01:27:05.572
one. Okay, that ends your turn. Let's see.
(counting) So after Frankfurt, Holly goes. Okay,

01:27:05.572 --> 01:27:17.397
that's you, Jayne. Next is the guard who failed on
his attack against you, tabaxi, the last time. So

01:27:17.397 --> 01:27:25.312
instead, he's frustrated by that, so he will
attack again. Why not? He rolls a natural 20 with

01:27:25.312 --> 01:27:37.682
his longsword. d8. This is not going to be good
for you. Eight. So 16 points of damage as you take

01:27:37.682 --> 01:27:47.487
a sword right in your left shin. Your leg buckles.
You fall to one knee and blood starts pouring out

01:27:47.487 --> 01:27:55.877
of your furry knee. And he says, "I've got you
that time!" That's his turn. We go to Clothesline,

01:27:55.877 --> 01:27:57.103
it's your turn.

01:27:57.103 --> 01:28:05.525
ASHLY: You fucking asshole! What's the worst that
I can do to him on sword, please? I'm going to

01:28:05.525 --> 01:28:06.984
slash at him with my longsword.

01:28:06.984 --> 01:28:08.627
SAM: Sure, go for it.

01:28:08.627 --> 01:28:11.095
ASHLY: So that is a ten.

01:28:11.095 --> 01:28:20.382
SAM: Ooh. Because your knee is buckled, you're
wobbly. Your sword strike goes errant and strikes

01:28:20.382 --> 01:28:26.512
the side of the bar, digging into it. He looks up
at you and laughs again. This is an epic battle

01:28:26.512 --> 01:28:29.300
between a very lowly guard and you.

01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:34.717
ASHLY: Can I still do a bonus action?

01:28:34.717 --> 01:28:41.232
SAM: Oh, yeah, you do have a bonus action! You
have, I believe, an action surge if you wanted to

01:28:41.232 --> 01:28:42.498
attack again.

01:28:42.498 --> 01:28:47.617
LIAM: You could get an extra one-time attack right
now.

01:28:47.617 --> 01:28:50.297
SAM: You can just attack again. I gave her two
because I like her.

01:28:50.297 --> 01:28:57.786
ASHLY: I'm going to try to do the same thing:
attack with my longsword. Okay. 14?

01:28:57.786 --> 01:29:00.165
SAM: That hits. He has AC 13.

01:29:00.219 --> 01:29:08.227
ASHLY: 1d8. Is this a d8? I'm so bad at this.
This, right? Okay. Eight.

01:29:08.227 --> 01:29:16.724
SAM: Okay. Yeah, he's dead. Your sword digs into
his neck, getting about halfway in. He looks

01:29:16.724 --> 01:29:21.821
surprised and he falls over, limp on the ground.
He's gone and dead.

01:29:21.821 --> 01:29:23.958
LIAM: I'll never learn the violin!

01:29:23.958 --> 01:29:26.248
SAM: End of him.

01:29:26.248 --> 01:29:28.594
BRIAN: You're getting hotter as this night goes
on.

01:29:28.594 --> 01:29:32.499
SAM: Jesus. Frankfurt, you are up.

01:29:32.499 --> 01:29:37.376
ERIC: How can I get in contact with Gryffin? Is
she gone?

01:29:37.376 --> 01:29:38.786
SAM: In contact with her?

01:29:38.786 --> 01:29:41.245
MARY: I'm fucking filling up bottles with Greep.

01:29:41.245 --> 01:29:43.953
SAM: Yeah, she's behind the bar. You can yell at
her.

01:29:43.953 --> 01:29:45.658
ERIC: Hey!

01:29:45.658 --> 01:29:48.206
MARY: Frankfurt!

01:29:48.206 --> 01:29:56.021
ERIC: Yes. Apparently, I have a thing for a
fine-looking noble blondes. That'd be you.

01:29:56.021 --> 01:29:58.917
SAM: You're flirting during this fight?

01:29:58.917 --> 01:30:00.608
ERIC: Yeah.

01:30:00.608 --> 01:30:03.028
MARY: Thirsty?

01:30:03.028 --> 01:30:05.296
ERIC: Yes. Greep, please.

01:30:05.296 --> 01:30:18.662
SAM: People are running around half-naked. Somehow
all the sound dims. They make eye contact. It's

01:30:18.662 --> 01:30:19.876
beautiful.

01:30:19.876 --> 01:30:22.117
ERIC: I've been looking all over for you.

01:30:22.117 --> 01:30:23.278
MARY: I've been looking for you, too.

01:30:23.278 --> 01:30:24.989
ERIC: I have Holly.

01:30:24.989 --> 01:30:26.406
MARY: I know. I need her.

01:30:26.406 --> 01:30:27.251
ERIC: Okay.

01:30:27.251 --> 01:30:30.679
SAM: As you talk, Holly is walking towards the
door.

01:30:30.679 --> 01:30:32.701
MARY: She's walking away from you.

01:30:32.701 --> 01:30:36.137
ERIC: How can I stop Holly?

01:30:36.137 --> 01:30:40.071
SAM: You can move. You can attack. You can grab.
You can do all sorts of things.

01:30:40.071 --> 01:30:43.663
ERIC: What has her possessed to move away?

01:30:43.663 --> 01:30:48.855
SAM: You don't know. All you saw was she stood up,
walked away from the table, and started walking

01:30:48.855 --> 01:30:59.438
towards the door. She paused briefly to look up at
Jayne, this white-haired person. Jayne kept

01:30:59.438 --> 01:31:06.549
walking to the door, and Holly's eyes followed
followed Jayne. It looks like she's watching

01:31:06.549 --> 01:31:09.462
Jayne's every move with rapt attention.

01:31:09.462 --> 01:31:11.436
LIAM: I am rather attractive.

01:31:11.436 --> 01:31:13.868
ERIC: Well, I got to do something about Jayne,
then.

01:31:13.868 --> 01:31:15.093
MARY: Get Holly.

01:31:15.093 --> 01:31:16.352
ERIC: I will get Holly.

01:31:16.352 --> 01:31:23.059
SAM: You're right here, and I forget your
movement, but you can at least move to Holly. 25.

01:31:23.059 --> 01:31:31.979
You can get to Holly if you'd like to. Okay, you
jump over this dog, you get to Holly. A courier

01:31:31.979 --> 01:31:33.643
pigeon flies by.

01:31:33.643 --> 01:31:40.605
ERIC: I got shit in my eye! Fucking pigeon! How is
there a pigeon inside of a tavern?

01:31:40.605 --> 01:31:48.349
SAM: You can grab her. You can attack someone. You
can do whatever you would like to do.

01:31:48.349 --> 01:31:50.528
ERIC: Well, I will secure her. I will grab her.

01:31:50.528 --> 01:31:53.172
SAM: Okay, so roll a strength check.

01:31:53.172 --> 01:31:58.524
BRIAN: Roll a d20, Eric, and add your strength
modifier.

01:31:58.524 --> 01:32:02.720
ERIC: Okay, d20? Ten.

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:18.428
SAM: Okay. What's your strength modifier? It's
four, for you, so 14. So she's going to roll. She

01:32:18.428 --> 01:32:21.598
rolls an eight plus zero. She is grappled!

01:32:21.598 --> 01:32:26.520
ERIC: You're not going anywhere! I've got a job to
do.

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:33.733
SAM: Still, her eyes seem distant, and pupils
dilated, but she is unable to move any further.

01:32:33.733 --> 01:32:35.622
BRIAN: Put the ring around her, Sam. You brought
it all the way here.

01:32:35.622 --> 01:32:46.366
SAM: I got multiple rings! Holly's not moving. You
have a bonus action if you want to use it. You

01:32:46.366 --> 01:32:57.287
have bonus actions if you'd like. I don't know
what spells you've chosen, but you do have a few

01:32:57.287 --> 01:33:01.517
spells that you can use as a bonus action. Or you
can do nothing, yell to Obby.

01:33:01.517 --> 01:33:05.035
LIAM: Oh! Command only lasts one round.

01:33:05.035 --> 01:33:10.570
SAM: Well, it hasn't come back to Holly yet.

01:33:10.570 --> 01:33:13.925
LIAM: Well, I'm letting you know, that it's not
going to last forever.

01:33:13.925 --> 01:33:15.196
SAM: That's good to know.

01:33:15.196 --> 01:33:19.762
BRIAN: That's bringing her towards you?

01:33:19.762 --> 01:33:21.095
LIAM: At the moment.

01:33:21.095 --> 01:33:23.374
SAM: It was your "and I walk away" that did it.

01:33:23.374 --> 01:33:25.768
ERIC: Can I Smite anyone?

01:33:25.768 --> 01:33:28.698
MARY: Does he have any more movement?

01:33:28.698 --> 01:33:34.440
SAM: It took most of his movement to get over
there. It's a cramped bar; he's dodging dogs and

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:37.406
stuff. Smite, I don't know how it works. Liam, how
does Smite work?

01:33:37.406 --> 01:33:41.955
LIAM: He attacks. If he hits, he does regular
damage and adds Smite damage.

01:33:41.955 --> 01:33:46.225
SAM: Oh, but this is Divine Smite you're talking
about. That is after a melee hit. We're looking at

01:33:46.225 --> 01:33:49.461
a bonus action. He's used his action to grapple
Holly.

01:33:49.461 --> 01:33:51.868
LIAM: Right, so he can't attack.

01:33:51.868 --> 01:33:54.875
SAM: He can't attack. If you have a bonus action
spell?

01:33:54.875 --> 01:34:00.384
LIAM: He could cast Hunter's Mark. Did you cast
that already? You could cast Hunter's Mark on

01:34:00.384 --> 01:34:02.334
Jayne, or anybody.

01:34:02.334 --> 01:34:07.542
SAM: Or you don't have to do anything. You can
hold your spells for later, whatever you want to do.

01:34:07.542 --> 01:34:09.212
ERIC: I'm happy with grappling.

01:34:09.212 --> 01:34:11.578
SAM: Okay, good. I love your voice.

01:34:11.578 --> 01:34:16.623
ERIC: What voice? I'm just being myself.

01:34:16.623 --> 01:34:21.726
SAM: The old man who was trying to flee, he's
going to attack one of the whores. He does not hit.

01:34:21.726 --> 01:34:23.908
MARY: Whores are tough.

01:34:23.908 --> 01:34:27.924
BRIAN: You leave those whores alone.

01:34:27.924 --> 01:34:33.238
SAM: It is Holly's turn. She is restrained. She
doesn't know what the fuck's going on. She's still

01:34:33.238 --> 01:34:38.302
under her spell. I guess the spell is fading off
now. So she shakes it off, doesn't know how she

01:34:38.302 --> 01:34:43.678
got over here. Now she's being held by a strong
dwarf man. She doesn't do anything to fight that.

01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:50.410
Kingston? It's your turn.

01:34:50.410 --> 01:34:54.376
BRIAN: Am I still over by that table over there?

01:34:54.376 --> 01:34:56.292
SAM: You are still over by the table.

01:34:56.292 --> 01:35:00.127
BRIAN: And where is Frankfurt, at the moment?

01:35:00.127 --> 01:35:03.197
SAM: Frankfurt's closer to the door. He's this guy
in gold right here.

01:35:03.197 --> 01:35:06.165
BRIAN: Okay, cool. I'm going to cast Hold Person
on Frankfurt.

01:35:06.165 --> 01:35:12.999
SAM: Oh, shit. Wait, you're going to hold a guy
who's holding a girl. This is amazing. Okay,

01:35:12.999 --> 01:35:28.909
Kingston, your spell DC is 14. Hold Person, I
believe, is wisdom? So roll a d20 and add your

01:35:28.909 --> 01:35:34.848
wisdom save modifier. It's in a little box that
Liam will point to you right now.

01:35:34.848 --> 01:35:41.958
LIAM: Wisdom save is this, so plus three. Natural
20!

01:35:41.958 --> 01:35:46.421
SAM: Spells are not working tonight.

01:35:46.421 --> 01:35:50.623
LIAM: Actually: thanks, Keyleth. Because those are
her dice.

01:35:50.623 --> 01:35:56.616
SAM: Kingston has been drinking a lot tonight, so
all of his spells when uttered come out a little

01:35:56.616 --> 01:36:04.531
bit slurry. And they don't seem to have as much
power. Again, there's a little prickling in the

01:36:04.531 --> 01:36:08.499
back of your neck but nothing happens. Kingston's
very frustrated. You have a bonus action and

01:36:08.499 --> 01:36:10.489
movement if you'd like it, Kingston.

01:36:10.489 --> 01:36:24.871
BRIAN: I'm going to move over where I was by the
bar at the beginning. At the end of the bar.

01:36:24.871 --> 01:36:30.995
SAM: I think you can move, what, 30 feet? No one's
engaging you, so you walk over and you get all the

01:36:30.995 --> 01:36:32.257
way there.

01:36:32.257 --> 01:36:40.499
BRIAN: Then that's probably good. I don't know
what to do for a bonus action.

01:36:40.499 --> 01:36:45.477
SAM: You don't have to do anything. You can
inspire. You can heal.

01:36:45.477 --> 01:36:48.074
BRIAN: I can't use a cantrip for a bonus action,
can I?

01:36:48.074 --> 01:36:54.403
SAM: I let Mary do it. Yeah, go for it, because
your spells have been sucking tonight.

01:36:54.403 --> 01:36:58.830
BRIAN: I was going to do Vicious Mockery on
Frankfurt.

01:36:58.830 --> 01:37:02.631
SAM: Okay, before you move, while you're still in
range of him, because I think it's 30 feet--

01:37:02.631 --> 01:37:04.289
BRIAN: 60.

01:37:04.289 --> 01:37:08.995
SAM: 60? Then by the bar, you got to yell loud
because you're across this loud bar.

01:37:08.995 --> 01:37:17.482
BRIAN: (singing) I'm so excited! And I just can't
hide it! I know, I know, I know, I know I'm going

01:37:17.482 --> 01:37:19.238
to kill you!

01:37:19.238 --> 01:37:28.956
SAM: The sung words from Kingston's somewhat-drunk
voice enter your ear and affect you in a way that

01:37:28.956 --> 01:37:36.551
you've never felt before. You feel bad about
yourself. You feel demeaned, and you feel unsure

01:37:36.551 --> 01:37:42.142
of yourself as a dwarf in general. You take actual
physical damage.

01:37:42.142 --> 01:37:46.675
BRIAN: It's 1d4 psychic damage, and you have
disadvantage on the next attack roll you make

01:37:46.675 --> 01:37:48.706
before the end of your turn.

01:37:48.706 --> 01:37:52.272
SAM: So roll a d4 and add something.

01:37:52.272 --> 01:37:55.350
BRIAN: Do I add my spell--

01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:58.483
SAM: No, just a d4. This is a damage roll we're
doing.

01:37:58.483 --> 01:37:59.664
BRIAN: That's a four.

01:37:59.664 --> 01:38:05.019
SAM: Four plus what does it say on the spell? 1d4
plus something?

01:38:05.019 --> 01:38:09.555
BRIAN: Psychic damage. Yeah, 1d4 psychic damage
and you take disadvantage on the next attack roll.

01:38:09.555 --> 01:38:17.209
SAM: So you take four points of damage, so you are
less powerful than you were before, and you can't

01:38:17.209 --> 01:38:22.268
get the song out of your head, and it will affect
your next turn. You will have to do your next turn

01:38:22.268 --> 01:38:26.620
at disadvantage, which means you will be thrown
off. So take your little number there and reduce

01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:28.545
it by some points.

01:38:28.545 --> 01:38:29.844
ERIC: So 34, right?

01:38:29.844 --> 01:38:38.231
SAM: Yep, sure. Okay, that is Kingston. The
half-orc is going to run over to Kingston and hit

01:38:38.231 --> 01:38:48.508
him. He heard your dulcet tones. He doesn't like
them. It is an unarmed strike. He does not hit

01:38:48.508 --> 01:38:56.417
you. He whiffs. The sound confuses him, and he's
too tall for you, anyway. Just goes right over

01:38:56.417 --> 01:38:57.828
your head clean.

01:38:57.828 --> 01:38:59.314
LIAM: "I have auditory issues."

01:38:59.314 --> 01:39:05.008
SAM: That's the top of the round. What do I do
next?

01:39:05.008 --> 01:39:09.538
BRIAN: This is fun, Sam. Even though the spells
aren't working.

01:39:09.538 --> 01:39:13.151
MARY: There's no magic working at all tonight.

01:39:13.151 --> 01:39:16.349
BRIAN: You guys can't see, but behind Sam, his
hair is starting to fall out.

01:39:16.349 --> 01:39:28.649
SAM: The heat of the room and the movement of
everyone around is really making the place fucking

01:39:28.649 --> 01:39:37.583
hot. So hot, in fact, that you all get the sense
that if you don't remove an article of clothing

01:39:37.583 --> 01:39:45.809
soon, you may become exhausted. So there's a brief
pause in the action where everyone says, "Oh my

01:39:45.809 --> 01:39:52.547
"god. It's fucking hot in here!" I would need you
all to either remove an article of clothing or suffer

01:39:52.547 --> 01:39:54.537
one point of exhaustion.

01:39:54.537 --> 01:39:57.637
LIAM: Oh man, the room has turned into (singing)
turn down for what!

01:39:57.637 --> 01:40:01.782
ASHLY: I'm going to rip everything clean off.

01:40:01.782 --> 01:40:07.489
SAM: Everything? Well, you're a furry. You've got
nothing on. So you're ripping your fur off?

01:40:07.489 --> 01:40:09.212
ASHLY: Wait, I don't have anything on?

01:40:09.212 --> 01:40:14.281
SAM: Where's your picture? Okay, you have armor.
You want to take off your armor? You're going to

01:40:14.281 --> 01:40:15.880
lose AC.

01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:19.808
ASHLY: Can I take off just the pants? Can I go
Donald Duck?

01:40:19.808 --> 01:40:31.362
SAM: Sure. I'm going to give you a negative one to
AC. So you're down to 18. And we can see your cat

01:40:31.362 --> 01:40:32.675
lady bits.

01:40:32.675 --> 01:40:34.081
ASHLY: Are they articulated?

01:40:34.081 --> 01:40:35.998
SAM: Yeah, they're nice.

01:40:35.998 --> 01:40:41.123
BRIAN: They are some of the best in the land.

01:40:41.123 --> 01:40:44.422
MARY: #CriticalRoleFanart.

01:40:44.422 --> 01:40:47.548
SAM: Kingston, anything?

01:40:47.548 --> 01:40:50.307
BRIAN: I'll take the point of exhaustion.

01:40:50.307 --> 01:40:53.916
SAM: Oh shit! So you have disadvantage--

01:40:53.916 --> 01:40:56.210
BRIAN: Wait, I thought it was minus one point.

01:40:56.210 --> 01:41:00.133
SAM: No, I think exhaustion is disadvantage on all
ability checks.

01:41:00.133 --> 01:41:07.872
BRIAN: Well, fuck that! I'll take off my corset.
What am I wearing? I'll take off my Spanx.

01:41:07.872 --> 01:41:11.803
SAM: You're going to take off your shirt, so you
are now shirtless.

01:41:11.803 --> 01:41:18.652
BRIAN: Yeah, behold! This is what happens when you
give up!

01:41:18.652 --> 01:41:26.770
SAM: He rips open his shirt. The buttons fly
everywhere exposing a really out of shape guy.

01:41:26.770 --> 01:41:30.732
Little man boobies, love handles.

01:41:30.732 --> 01:41:32.618
BRIAN: So I'm Dan Harmon, basically.

01:41:32.618 --> 01:41:39.401
SAM: Yeah, really lopsided, too. It's not good. A
writer's body. Gryffin, anything

01:41:39.401 --> 01:41:40.871
you'd like to remove?

01:41:40.871 --> 01:41:50.611
MARY: I'm ripping off my sleeves. I've got this
white gown underneath the light studded armor. I

01:41:50.611 --> 01:41:53.759
rip off some sleeves.

01:41:53.759 --> 01:41:58.990
SAM: All right, so you're sleeveless now. This is
strange for you, because it's an elegant gown. You

01:41:58.990 --> 01:42:04.691
rip off the sleeves and it's frayed and tattered
there. You feel a little uncomfortable. Jayne?

01:42:04.691 --> 01:42:12.790
LIAM: Yeah, I rip off the cloak that I'm wearing
to reveal the white porcelain doll dress and

01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:19.583
straps of white leather around the biceps and
around the thighs. Yeah, I look like Courtney Love

01:42:19.583 --> 01:42:21.147
a little bit.

01:42:21.147 --> 01:42:25.057
SAM: Anything else we should know about that we
see?

01:42:25.057 --> 01:42:32.313
LIAM: There are very light chain tattoos along the
collarbones, disappearing down the dress.

01:42:32.313 --> 01:42:35.676
SAM: You look so good. Frankfurt, what you got?

01:42:35.676 --> 01:42:40.605
ERIC: My chainmail shirt.

01:42:40.605 --> 01:42:42.127
SAM: You're going to take it off?

01:42:42.127 --> 01:42:43.288
LIAM: Wow.

01:42:43.288 --> 01:42:45.007
ERIC: Wait.

01:42:45.007 --> 01:42:53.824
BRIAN: That's how DND works. You take off the
stuff that's really heavy and metallic.

01:42:53.824 --> 01:42:55.580
ERIC: What if I shaved?

01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:59.023
SAM: You cannot shave.

01:42:59.023 --> 01:43:05.869
ERIC: It looks like I've got a--

01:43:05.869 --> 01:43:12.237
SAM: Some sort of a tunic thing. Your options are
pants or armor, we'll say.

01:43:12.237 --> 01:43:16.831
ASHLY and MARY: (chanting) Pants! Pants!

01:43:16.831 --> 01:43:17.954
ERIC: Pants!

01:43:17.954 --> 01:43:19.812
(laughter)

01:43:19.812 --> 01:43:21.166
ASHLY: You and me, Frankfurt!

01:43:21.166 --> 01:43:23.155
ERIC: I'm going to go with pants.

01:43:23.155 --> 01:43:32.197
SAM: Seeing Frankfurt's exposed wang drives
Kingston into a fit of rage. He knows that was the

01:43:32.197 --> 01:43:40.519
wang that was in his wife. And he wants to hit
that wang so hard. I don't know what's going on.

01:43:40.519 --> 01:43:48.213
BRIAN: Put those pants back on, you foul creature,
before I come over there and do no more damage to you!

01:43:48.213 --> 01:43:55.309
SAM: Obby the Rat, who has been saving his turn
for a while now and forgotten about, does not like

01:43:55.309 --> 01:44:01.782
where this is going. And so he strikes out at the
first person he can get to. What's his movement?

01:44:01.782 --> 01:44:06.486
Not very much. Shoot, he can't get to anybody.

01:44:06.486 --> 01:44:09.128
LIAM: "I kick the dog."

01:44:09.128 --> 01:44:15.251
SAM: Sure, he's going to kick the dog. No, why
would he kick a dog? He's going to attack

01:44:15.251 --> 01:44:16.617
someone who's in a fight.

01:44:16.617 --> 01:44:20.856
ASHLY: What about the old guy and the lady
prostitutes?

01:44:20.856 --> 01:44:28.938
SAM: Yeah, he's got to get there, though. He's
going to push past the prostitute and defend Holly

01:44:28.938 --> 01:44:37.114
and hit the first person he can, which is this
woman right here, this fighter. 15. Oh yeah, he

01:44:37.114 --> 01:44:38.635
takes her.

01:44:38.635 --> 01:44:41.355
BRIAN: Just a quick question. No one has attacked
the prostitutes yet, right?

01:44:41.355 --> 01:44:48.876
SAM: The old man has tried, but I think he failed.
Okay, she's gone, he knocks her out. She's dead.

01:44:48.876 --> 01:44:54.067
All right, top of the round? Oh my god, this is so
hard.

01:44:54.067 --> 01:44:57.155
LIAM: How does Matt do it, right? Every week.

01:44:57.155 --> 01:45:00.207
SAM: Okay. Gryffin, what would you like to do?

01:45:00.207 --> 01:45:10.307
MARY: So I take my sleeves, and I rip off a piece
and shove one into a bottle. Are there any candles

01:45:10.307 --> 01:45:12.134
lit near me?

01:45:12.134 --> 01:45:16.456
SAM: There are candles lit near you. There are
torches on the wall and a couple candles on the

01:45:16.456 --> 01:45:17.718
bar for light.

01:45:17.718 --> 01:45:24.435
MARY: So I light one of the bottles of Greep on
fire, and I throw it at the kitty-kitty-kitty.

01:45:24.435 --> 01:45:28.845
SAM: She's right next to you. You wouldn't have to
throw it far, you would just smash it on the bar.

01:45:28.845 --> 01:45:32.612
MARY: Smash it on the bar. Is that considered
movement at that point?

01:45:32.612 --> 01:45:36.702
SAM: I would say that you would want to move back
a little bit so you don't get splashed or hit.

01:45:36.702 --> 01:45:39.536
MARY: Well, I'd like to throw it at her and then
run.

01:45:39.536 --> 01:45:55.323
SAM: It's an area of effect, so I'm going to treat
this as like a very modified Fireball. What's your

01:45:55.323 --> 01:46:03.614
spell attack bonus? It's plus six. So roll a d20,
add six.

01:46:03.614 --> 01:46:07.173
ASHLY: I really want to do the Terminator thing
where I walk through the fire.

01:46:07.173 --> 01:46:13.775
MARY: 16. I'd like to use my Tides of Chaos again
but I can't.

01:46:13.775 --> 01:46:25.688
SAM: Oh, you have advantage! No, you used that the
last time. Let's see here, this would be a dex

01:46:25.688 --> 01:46:29.072
save. Do a dex save, catty.

01:46:29.072 --> 01:46:31.159
ASHLY: 18.

01:46:31.159 --> 01:46:38.078
SAM: So you still get burned, but you take half
damage. Let's see, it's a modified thing, so I'm

01:46:38.078 --> 01:46:48.682
going to roll. That's cocked. So take five points
of fire damage as the fire spreads across the bar.

01:46:48.682 --> 01:46:58.104
Let's say that it's green fire, because I have a
rubber band. That guy gets hit, too. He takes one

01:46:58.104 --> 01:47:00.929
point of damage. Kingston, you take--

01:47:00.929 --> 01:47:02.491
BRIAN: Wait, I'm at the other end.

01:47:02.491 --> 01:47:04.268
SAM: I thought you were here?

01:47:04.268 --> 01:47:11.298
BRIAN: At the start of the game I was at that end
of the bar. That's okay. I might still get hit,

01:47:11.298 --> 01:47:13.741
but that's fine. I just wanted to be on that
corner.

01:47:13.741 --> 01:47:17.431
LIAM: You created a combat scenario for yourself
with 33 enemies.

01:47:17.431 --> 01:47:24.479
SAM: I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
Okay, good. The bar's on fire. People are running

01:47:24.479 --> 01:47:32.898
away from it, "I don't know who I am! I don't have
a fully fleshed-out character!" This cat is on

01:47:32.898 --> 01:47:42.251
fire, makes your heart weep. And your fur is on
fire, as well. This is bad. That was great.

01:47:42.251 --> 01:47:43.980
Anything bonus, anything other?

01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:50.540
MARY: No. I'd love to reset that Tides of Chaos. I
have to roll on the table.

01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:53.057
SAM: You have to cast a spell for that, right?

01:47:53.057 --> 01:47:55.952
MARY: Once I do Tides of Chaos, you can do it--

01:47:55.952 --> 01:48:02.959
SAM: No, I mean you have to cast something to roll
on the table. Spells don't just come out of you,

01:48:02.959 --> 01:48:12.564
you have to try to cast a spell, right? I don't
know how your fucking wild sorcery works.

01:48:12.564 --> 01:48:16.074
MARY: So was that my action, to drop all of that?

01:48:16.074 --> 01:48:19.307
SAM: Yes, but if you have a bonus action or
something you can use?

01:48:19.307 --> 01:48:34.312
MARY: Yes, I would like to bonus action a
Firebolt at kitty-kitty-kitty.

01:48:34.312 --> 01:48:39.769
SAM: Oh my god, fire is the thing today. So you
automatically roll on the table. So get out your

01:48:39.769 --> 01:48:45.707
100-sided die. This young lady is a wild sorcerer,
she--

01:48:45.707 --> 01:48:49.254
MARY: (New Jersey accent) Hey, don't fucking tell
me what the fuck I am, motherfucker! All right?

01:48:49.254 --> 01:48:53.407
Hold on a second! How you people doing? You good?
Look at you, little girl with your white hair.

01:48:53.407 --> 01:48:58.631
Where the fuck did that come from? Ooh,
kitty-kitty-kitty, fucking pussy. How you doing?

01:48:58.631 --> 01:49:03.371
You and I need to talk later, apparently, from
what I hear. I'm not sure. You got man boobs;

01:49:03.371 --> 01:49:08.612
that's kind of hot. Okay, what did I roll? I
rolled an 80-fucking-six. How you doing? Hold on,

01:49:08.612 --> 01:49:10.416
just wait!

01:49:10.416 --> 01:49:17.752
SAM: She starts acting very strangely, talking in
a different accent. Her whole personality shifts

01:49:17.752 --> 01:49:20.651
and magic seems to overtake her body.

01:49:20.651 --> 01:49:24.683
MARY: (New Jersey accent) What the
bing-ba-da-bing-bo-boom? This is bad. I can feel

01:49:24.683 --> 01:49:29.273
it, oh! Oh! Ba-da-bing!

01:49:29.273 --> 01:49:35.607
SAM: The Diceman over there feels a sudden pain
inside her belly as part of her magic has

01:49:35.607 --> 01:49:44.723
disappeared. She tried to cast a Firebolt spell on
you, but instead of any fire coming out of her,

01:49:44.723 --> 01:49:52.140
nothing happens. Instead she feels slightly less
magical than she was a moment ago. She has lost

01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:54.578
her highest spell slot.

01:49:54.578 --> 01:50:00.400
MARY: (New Jersey accent) I got maybe one left. I
don't know. I love you people! I'll talk to you

01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:05.675
soon. Go to the Clam Broth House. They need
service over there. Ba-da-bing, love you, Jersey!

01:50:05.675 --> 01:50:07.334
That's my name, too!

01:50:07.334 --> 01:50:10.665
LIAM: (New Jersey accent) Did you just make a
Hoboken reference in the middle of our DND game?

01:50:10.665 --> 01:50:13.016
MARY: (New Jersey accent) It don't exist no more,
bitches.

01:50:13.016 --> 01:50:18.572
LIAM: (New Jersey accent) The Clam Broth House is
a huge part of my childhood, and she's right. It's

01:50:18.572 --> 01:50:20.851
not there any more. It's been gentrified.

01:50:20.851 --> 01:50:24.910
MARY: (New Jersey accent) Every fucking Mother's
Day we used to go to the-- Father's Day.

01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:27.833
BRIAN: Now it's a Momofuku or whatever it was.

01:50:27.833 --> 01:50:31.323
LIAM: (New Jersey accent) Sure, yeah. When I was a
kid, it was a place where drunks stumbled out of.

01:50:31.323 --> 01:50:34.404
MARY: (New Jersey accent) It was a place where
freaking Sinatra used to go.

01:50:34.404 --> 01:50:38.436
SAM: The guy the no pants, the old man is dead.
One of the whores just killed him with a

01:50:38.436 --> 01:50:39.952
crossbow.

01:50:39.952 --> 01:50:42.058
BRIAN: What was her name? Was it Kay?

01:50:42.058 --> 01:50:43.519
SAM: That was Kay.

01:50:43.519 --> 01:50:48.620
BRIAN: Good job, Kay. You get extra applesauce.

01:50:48.620 --> 01:50:56.309
SAM: We go to four. This other ranger now sees
that the dwarves are on the move. She shoots a

01:50:56.309 --> 01:51:02.151
shot at you, Frankfurt. What's your AC?

01:51:02.151 --> 01:51:05.798
LIAM: It is 15.

01:51:05.798 --> 01:51:13.401
SAM: She does not hit you. A crossbow bolt whizzes
by your body and hits this person behind you.

01:51:13.401 --> 01:51:20.405
"Hey, I wasn't even doing anything!" Let's see
here. Jayne, you're up.

01:51:20.405 --> 01:51:31.021
LIAM: Oh, am I? There's still a dwarf holding the
girl, right? The dwarf is holding her?

01:51:31.021 --> 01:51:34.577
SAM: The dwarf? No, Frankfurt is still holding
her. She is grappled.

01:51:34.577 --> 01:51:35.921
LIAM: Frankfurt is?

01:51:35.921 --> 01:51:38.302
SAM: Yeah, Obby is standing in front of her in a
defensive position.

01:51:38.302 --> 01:51:42.668
LIAM: I would like to hit that fucking dwarf's
bare ass with my whip, so I'm going to make an

01:51:42.668 --> 01:51:46.180
attack. Oh, that's a natural one!

01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:48.215
(groaning)

01:51:48.215 --> 01:51:56.147
SAM: The whip crack knocks a bowl of Greep off the
table. It explodes! There is fire on the floor

01:51:56.147 --> 01:52:02.206
over there. Right there. She's on fire. "I
literally haven't done anything!"

01:52:02.206 --> 01:52:12.267
LIAM: Fucking fuck a duck. As a bonus action, I
would like to cast Sanctuary on myself.

01:52:12.267 --> 01:52:17.539
SAM: Okay. An invisible shield comes up around
Jayne, who is still right next to the door, unless

01:52:17.539 --> 01:52:18.859
you want to move.

01:52:18.859 --> 01:52:23.419
LIAM: No, I have to stay right here. Next.

01:52:23.419 --> 01:52:33.750
SAM: Okay. Val, the human bartender, will pick up
her greataxe from behind the bar, and she wants

01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:42.710
you off the bar. She's going to swing. She's
trying to protect her bar. Ten. What's your AC?

01:52:42.710 --> 01:52:44.430
ASHLY: An 18.

01:52:44.430 --> 01:52:50.707
SAM: You're fine. The fire confuses her. She
swings wide. Clothesline, you're up.

01:52:50.707 --> 01:52:53.400
ASHLY: I'm going to fucking pounce on this
motherfucker. Okay.

01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:54.653
SAM: On the bartender?

01:52:54.653 --> 01:53:01.691
ASHLY: No, on this one. This cat's claws thing.
What is that? What's the deal with that? Climbing

01:53:01.691 --> 01:53:03.046
speed of 20?

01:53:03.046 --> 01:53:07.531
SAM: Oh, you can climb very well and fast. That's
all. You can also slash with them.

01:53:07.531 --> 01:53:16.381
ASHLY: As part of my movement toward her, could I
slash during my movement? Like a pounce?

01:53:16.381 --> 01:53:19.213
SAM: You mean to get two strikes out of it?

01:53:19.213 --> 01:53:20.496
ASHLY: Yeah.

01:53:20.496 --> 01:53:29.643
SAM: I would say that upon reaching her, you could
make a slash attack, but you'd have to get to her

01:53:29.643 --> 01:53:32.817
and then past her to even touch her.

01:53:32.817 --> 01:53:35.637
ASHLY: Okay, I'm just going to move toward her,
then. Hop off the bar.

01:53:35.637 --> 01:53:38.257
SAM: Okay. So you jump off the bar. You're no
longer on fire or in the fire. You get right next

01:53:38.257 --> 01:53:39.527
to her.

01:53:39.527 --> 01:53:42.571
ASHLY: And I'm going to clothesline her.

01:53:42.571 --> 01:53:44.795
SAM: Sure. That's what you do.

01:53:44.795 --> 01:53:47.996
MARY: You're so repetitive!

01:53:47.996 --> 01:53:52.743
ASHLY: Hey Gryffin, are you freshly laundered
clothing? Because you're about to get

01:53:52.743 --> 01:53:54.009
clotheslined!

01:53:54.009 --> 01:53:56.199
(laughter)

01:53:56.199 --> 01:53:57.779
ASHLY: That's a 21.

01:53:57.779 --> 01:53:59.176
SAM: Oh, that'll hit.

01:53:59.176 --> 01:54:06.539
BRIAN: Hey, guys, we do not guarantee that all the
Critical Role dice roll this well. Because before

01:54:06.539 --> 01:54:08.570
you buy them, she's rolled three 20s on it.

01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:16.383
ASHLY: Five. And then she is knocked prone,
right?

01:54:16.383 --> 01:54:20.193
SAM: Oh wait, if you rolled a four, she is knocked
prone.

01:54:20.193 --> 01:54:22.447
MARY: Can I react to any of this?

01:54:22.447 --> 01:54:26.273
SAM: Sure. Do you have a reaction? Is that a thing
that you have?

01:54:26.273 --> 01:54:28.412
LIAM: There's no reaction to getting hit in the
face.

01:54:28.412 --> 01:54:35.128
SAM: No, unless by your class, can cast a reaction
spell, but I don't think you can, so you're okay.

01:54:35.128 --> 01:54:45.025
ASHLY: Okay, so I do four damage. No, five damage
because I rolled a one. And then, for a bonus

01:54:45.025 --> 01:54:51.543
action, oh! I should probably heal. Second wind.
Regains 1d10 plus four HP.

01:54:51.543 --> 01:54:54.348
SAM: Oh, nice. Roll that d10.

01:54:54.348 --> 01:54:56.644
BRIAN: Roll that beautiful bean footage.

01:54:56.644 --> 01:55:05.437
SAM: After she clotheslines you, we see the tabaxi
take a deep breath of air and now, out of the

01:55:05.437 --> 01:55:08.964
fire, suddenly she feels better than ever before.

01:55:08.964 --> 01:55:12.555
ASHLY: It says clothesline attack takes ten feet
of movement. Could I have moved away?

01:55:12.555 --> 01:55:15.266
SAM: How fast is your movement total?

01:55:15.266 --> 01:55:16.289
ASHLY: 30.

01:55:16.289 --> 01:55:19.983
SAM: So it took you 20 feet to get there. You have
another ten feet if you'd like to go somewhere else.

01:55:19.983 --> 01:55:27.234
ASHLY: Okay. I'll move toward Jayne and Frankfurt,
that whole situation.

01:55:27.234 --> 01:55:30.054
SAM: Okay, go this way. Excuse me, pardon me,
excuse me.

01:55:30.054 --> 01:55:31.866
MARY: Do I get an attack of--

01:55:31.866 --> 01:55:35.946
SAM: No, because I think it was a part of her-- I
think that's how it works. She does not get an

01:55:35.946 --> 01:55:37.606
attack of opportunity, right?

01:55:37.606 --> 01:55:39.303
LIAM: It's if somebody is running away from you.

01:55:39.303 --> 01:55:44.013
SAM: Yeah, but this is during the move, right?
You ran by, clotheslined her, and keep running. So

01:55:44.013 --> 01:55:45.883
I don't think you get an attack of opportunity.

01:55:45.883 --> 01:55:47.282
LIAM: That's hazy; that's up to you.

01:55:47.282 --> 01:55:55.101
SAM: I'm going to say no. Because I got to keep it
moving; there's more shit to do! Who's next? That

01:55:55.101 --> 01:55:58.089
was Jayne, Clothesline. Frankfurt, you're up.

01:55:58.089 --> 01:55:59.247
ERIC: Yes.

01:55:59.247 --> 01:56:01.644
SAM: What would you like to do, Frankie?

01:56:01.644 --> 01:56:06.037
ERIC: Is it possible to move Holly?

01:56:06.037 --> 01:56:09.003
SAM: Yeah, you're holding her. You can do whatever
you want.

01:56:09.003 --> 01:56:11.796
ERIC: I want to pull her towards Gryffin.

01:56:11.796 --> 01:56:16.260
SAM: Okay. Gryffin's way across the room. Sure.
What's your movement?

01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:17.832
ERIC: 25.

01:56:17.832 --> 01:56:28.848
SAM: She is not resisting. I'll say that you get
full halfway there, right around where kitty-cat

01:56:28.848 --> 01:56:35.175
is. That's your movement. You can still act. Can
still do something, or you could have attacked

01:56:35.175 --> 01:56:37.408
before you moved. Up to you.

01:56:37.408 --> 01:56:42.881
ERIC: I just need to talk to Gryffin. That's the
point.

01:56:42.881 --> 01:56:44.425
SAM: Just talking!

01:56:44.425 --> 01:56:45.742
ERIC: How you doing?

01:56:45.742 --> 01:56:47.139
MARY: I've been better!

01:56:47.139 --> 01:56:51.203
ERIC: I'd like to heal her. Is that a
possibility?

01:56:51.203 --> 01:56:57.262
SAM: Sure, yeah! Do you have a healing spell of some
sort or a potion of some sort?

01:56:57.262 --> 01:57:00.714
ERIC: I believe so.

01:57:00.714 --> 01:57:08.327
SAM: Lay on Hands. You can use Lay on Hands. You
have a healing pool of 20 hit points you can give

01:57:08.327 --> 01:57:14.731
in any denomination to anyone. So you can give her
20, you can give her one, you can give her four.

01:57:14.731 --> 01:57:16.581
You can do whatever you want.

01:57:16.581 --> 01:57:19.929
ERIC: What's it going to take to make you feel
better? We can strike a deal. Ten.

01:57:19.929 --> 01:57:28.969
SAM: So from your 20, you now have ten left in
your reserve. Gryffin heals ten. If you want to do

01:57:28.969 --> 01:57:31.540
a bonus action, or anything else?

01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:34.787
LIAM: Hunter's Mark or nothing.

01:57:34.787 --> 01:57:36.143
ERIC: Nothing.

01:57:36.143 --> 01:57:44.373
SAM: Good. That's Frankfurt. Who's left? Holly's
not going to do anything. That guy is dead. We're

01:57:44.373 --> 01:57:46.491
going to go to Kingston.

01:57:46.491 --> 01:57:56.754
BRIAN: I am going to move closer to the action.
Can you put me on your left side of that table

01:57:56.754 --> 01:58:01.250
with the weird onion garlic clove looking nutsack
on it? Is that a candle?

01:58:01.250 --> 01:58:02.707
SAM: Yes.

01:58:02.707 --> 01:58:09.845
BRIAN: Put me there, bro. Then I'm going to cast
Sleep onto Frankfurt.

01:58:09.845 --> 01:58:20.391
SAM: Shit. You guys are turning really mean. Go
for it. Sleep is not a ranged attack; it's a spell

01:58:20.391 --> 01:58:24.917
save DC of 14 against what save?

01:58:24.917 --> 01:58:30.325
BRIAN: Can I target one person with it, or does it
get everybody? I've never used this spell.

01:58:30.325 --> 01:58:33.805
SAM: Learn your spells! I can look it up.

01:58:33.805 --> 01:58:39.835
BRIAN: Roll 5d8. The total is how many points of
creatures this spell can affect. Does that mean I

01:58:39.835 --> 01:58:41.613
get everybody with that?

01:58:41.613 --> 01:58:44.385
SAM: Roll 5d8 first.

01:58:44.385 --> 01:58:53.521
BRIAN: All eights. Just kidding.

01:58:53.521 --> 01:59:00.535
SAM: Oh, there's no save on Sleep. It just
happens.

01:59:00.535 --> 01:59:02.593
LIAM: You count it up.

01:59:02.593 --> 01:59:04.018
BRIAN: 25.

01:59:04.018 --> 01:59:08.105
SAM: 25. Okay. I don't how this works because
you've got more than 25 hit points.

01:59:08.105 --> 01:59:12.791
LIAM: The one with the lowest hit points gets hit
first within the area of effect.

01:59:12.791 --> 01:59:14.354
MARY: How many does Holly have?

01:59:14.354 --> 01:59:18.766
SAM: The lowest hit points?

01:59:18.766 --> 01:59:22.280
LIAM: Creatures within 20 feet of a point you
choose within range. Did you pick a point?

01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:23.981
SAM: He picked Frankfurt.

01:59:23.981 --> 01:59:28.165
LIAM: Are affected in ascending order of their
current hit points, starting with the creature

01:59:28.165 --> 01:59:32.933
that has the lowest current hit points. Each
creature affected by this spell falls unconscious

01:59:32.933 --> 01:59:35.255
until the spell ends.

01:59:35.255 --> 01:59:37.551
BRIAN: Fuck, Sam, this one's complicated.

01:59:37.551 --> 01:59:39.362
MARY: How many does Holly have?

01:59:39.362 --> 01:59:41.126
SAM: More than that, and so does Frankfurt.

01:59:41.126 --> 01:59:45.947
LIAM: So whoever's at their lowest gets hit first.
Hit the dog with one hit point.

01:59:45.947 --> 01:59:48.046
SAM: Yeah, so the dog's asleep.

01:59:48.046 --> 01:59:50.038
LIAM: That's the first hit point.

01:59:50.038 --> 01:59:53.245
SAM: Tabaxi, how many hit points do you have?
She's okay.

01:59:53.245 --> 01:59:56.927
MARY: What about Zarvah?

01:59:56.927 --> 02:00:00.451
BRIAN: I don't want to hit tabaxi, I want to hit
Dr. Frankfurt!

02:00:00.451 --> 02:00:04.104
LIAM: Frankfurt's in the center. Viking woman.
Barmaid?

02:00:04.104 --> 02:00:15.425
SAM: Yeah, so she's down. She's asleep on fire.
Barmaid's asleep, for sure. And then there's not

02:00:15.425 --> 02:00:28.192
enough hit points left for him. You make all these
randoms fall asleep. This guy, too. Four people

02:00:28.192 --> 02:00:32.257
pass out around Frankfurt. They are peacefully
asleep.

02:00:32.257 --> 02:00:47.910
BRIAN: All right, so then for my bonus non-action,
can I inspire my beautiful cat friend with a

02:00:47.910 --> 02:00:49.338
bardic inspiration?

02:00:49.338 --> 02:00:50.563
SAM: Of course you can.

02:00:50.563 --> 02:00:52.425
ASHLY: This relationship is so confusing!

02:00:52.425 --> 02:01:03.481
BRIAN: Not to me. I'm going to cast this on you,
and you can add 1d6 to an attack, save. Okay.

02:01:03.481 --> 02:01:14.869
(sings) Pour me some Greep, boys, and fuck my tab.
I want to go home with this sexy cat, and maybe Jayne.

02:01:14.869 --> 02:01:17.898
ASHLY: (singing) Jayne's a minor.

02:01:17.898 --> 02:01:21.178
MARY: (singing) Those rules don't apply in this
world.

02:01:21.178 --> 02:01:26.512
LIAM: She's not a minor, but she is not
interested.

02:01:26.512 --> 02:01:30.259
BRIAN: Yet. Wait until I put my shirt back on.

02:01:30.259 --> 02:01:35.110
SAM: That's an inspiration to you. Hearing his
words of compliment inspires you. What is your

02:01:35.110 --> 02:01:36.678
inspiration die?

02:01:36.678 --> 02:01:40.711
BRIAN: You know what, man? As a bard, tell me
where that is.

02:01:40.711 --> 02:01:43.373
(laughter)

02:01:43.373 --> 02:01:52.535
SAM: We'll look it up. I don't remember. It's your
charisma modifier. It's probably a d8. I'm going

02:01:52.535 --> 02:01:56.561
to say a d8, because I don't know, man. You get
one extra d8 on your next roll.

02:01:56.561 --> 02:02:01.500
BRIAN: Oh, wait, no. It says here that it's a d6.
Yeah, cast this on another creature. That player

02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:03.743
can add 1d6 to an attack, save, or skill check.

02:02:03.743 --> 02:02:06.752
LIAM: Players are in charge of knowing their shit,
except for Eric.

02:02:06.752 --> 02:02:21.371
SAM: Okay! Suddenly, without warning, without
making a sound, a new mysterious figure emerges

02:02:21.427 --> 02:02:31.045
from the back room. Pushing Xavier away, he moves
quickly and silently across the Ass Sailor with a

02:02:31.045 --> 02:02:36.587
speed none of you have ever witnessed. It's like
the figure runs without moving his body. He floats

02:02:36.587 --> 02:02:46.299
in a beautiful sprint. As he passes by you,
Gryffin, you suddenly feel even hotter than

02:02:46.299 --> 02:02:52.603
before. For an instant, he strikes fear into your
heart. Roll a perception check.

02:02:52.603 --> 02:03:04.518
MARY: (gasps) Perception. That would be a 20.

02:03:04.518 --> 02:03:14.955
SAM: Oh fuck. Okay. I could whisper, but that
takes too much time. You see first, as he glides

02:03:14.955 --> 02:03:22.251
past you, he is wearing pants. He looks like a
normal human man except his eyes are different.

02:03:22.251 --> 02:03:32.338
They seem to glow red. It's disconcerting. Also,
as you watch him run, his gait is weird. There's

02:03:32.338 --> 02:03:39.766
no this movement of his shoulder, it's just
straight like he's floating, like he has no legs.

02:03:39.766 --> 02:03:49.511
And as he whizzes by you, past these sleeping
people, you see the faintest flick of a tail. He

02:03:49.511 --> 02:03:57.274
runs across. Does not say a word. Does not make an
attack towards you, Frankfurt. Does not even

02:03:57.274 --> 02:04:03.333
regard you. But simply removes Holly from your
grasp. Roll a strength save.

02:04:03.333 --> 02:04:05.634
ERIC: With which dice?

02:04:05.634 --> 02:04:09.283
SAM: d20 plus your strength. Ability check.

02:04:09.283 --> 02:04:13.769
ERIC: Is that Garello? Excuse me!

02:04:13.769 --> 02:04:19.795
LIAM: You don't know. That's the mystery, Eric.
Plus five, that's right. 23!

02:04:19.795 --> 02:04:25.686
SAM: 23? Let me look. Oh, wait. Didn't you have
some sort of disadvantage?

02:04:25.686 --> 02:04:30.901
MARY: No, he tried to cast Sleep on him, but it
didn't work.

02:04:30.901 --> 02:04:37.346
BRIAN: No, he got Vicious Mockery. Which means he
has disadvantage on his next attack roll.

02:04:37.346 --> 02:04:44.143
SAM: We're going to put it on this. Roll again. It
was a while ago; we never did it. We're doing it here.

02:04:44.143 --> 02:04:46.524
BRIAN: That wasn't his last turn.

02:04:46.524 --> 02:04:49.043
SAM: No, I know, but we haven't incorporated it.

02:04:49.043 --> 02:04:50.791
LIAM: So why are we doing it again?

02:04:50.791 --> 02:04:52.539
SAM: Did he roll with disadvantage on his last
turn?

02:04:52.539 --> 02:04:57.275
BRIAN: I did it after his last turn because I roll
after him in the initiative.

02:04:57.275 --> 02:05:01.467
LIAM: Jesus, it was almost the same! Oh no, that's
a 12. 17.

02:05:01.467 --> 02:05:12.794
SAM: 17. Where's the Guide? Shit. 17. Nope, that's
not it. Shit, too many pages! All right, I'm going

02:05:12.794 --> 02:05:19.537
to just make something up. I'm going to say that
there's a brief tug-of-war. He does wrest Holly

02:05:19.537 --> 02:05:27.508
from your grasp, but you slow him down
considerably and he only gets five more feet away

02:05:27.508 --> 02:05:29.411
from you. He's going this way.

02:05:29.411 --> 02:05:32.450
BRIAN: He's taking Holly with him.

02:05:32.450 --> 02:05:35.447
SAM: He's taking Holly with him, and he's making a
beeline this way.

02:05:35.447 --> 02:05:39.245
BRIAN: What's that way? The door's that way.

02:05:39.245 --> 02:05:47.879
SAM: I don't know. You don't know. Gryffin, you
saw this weird thing just happen. What are you

02:05:47.879 --> 02:05:49.380
going to do?

02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:51.303
MARY: Are we back up to the top of the round?

02:05:51.303 --> 02:05:52.909
SAM: Why not? Sure.

02:05:52.909 --> 02:06:04.657
MARY: All right. Oh my god. I rush over to
Frankfurt.

02:06:04.657 --> 02:06:08.308
SAM: You rush over to Frankfurt? Sure. What are
you doing?

02:06:08.308 --> 02:06:10.480
MARY: What the fuck is going on?

02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:11.861
ERIC: I don't know.

02:06:11.861 --> 02:06:13.047
MARY: Where's the girl?

02:06:13.047 --> 02:06:14.092
ERIC: Who was that guy?

02:06:14.092 --> 02:06:15.982
MARY: I don't know. There was a tail. He had some
sort of tail.

02:06:15.982 --> 02:06:17.161
ERIC: Where are my pants?

02:06:17.161 --> 02:06:22.104
MARY: Well, it got really hot in here. And you're
fine. Do you still have the hotdog buns? Because

02:06:22.104 --> 02:06:27.498
that could help keep you-- Are you all right? No?
Okay, don't worry about it. Who's the girl? Tell

02:06:27.498 --> 02:06:28.826
me about her.

02:06:28.826 --> 02:06:32.955
ERIC: Look, I don't know. Her name is Holly. She
lost her mother.

02:06:32.955 --> 02:06:35.303
MARY: Is she from Illyria?

02:06:35.303 --> 02:06:40.031
SAM: I love how they are having conversations
through this whole fight. I love it!

02:06:40.031 --> 02:06:48.589
MARY: That's all right, we're just going. How can
I help you? Is he prone, is he anything-- Is he all right?

02:06:48.589 --> 02:06:52.971
SAM: No, he's fine. Nothing happened.

02:06:52.971 --> 02:06:55.833
LIAM: This has got to be Gilmore Girls dialogue.

02:06:55.833 --> 02:06:59.212
SAM: He is naked from the waist down.

02:06:59.212 --> 02:07:02.307
ASHLY: He's feeling ashamed.

02:07:02.307 --> 02:07:05.894
MARY: I don't know what to do.

02:07:05.894 --> 02:07:12.085
SAM: Did you move over to Frankfurt? You see this
dude carrying a girl running across the room.

02:07:12.085 --> 02:07:29.409
MARY: All right. So I am going-- viciously mocked.
Okay! I am going to cast a cantrip of Ray of Frost

02:07:29.409 --> 02:07:36.668
on him. It's a ranged attack against a target.

02:07:36.668 --> 02:07:40.008
SAM: Roll a d20 and add six.

02:07:40.008 --> 02:07:43.288
MARY: 16.

02:07:43.288 --> 02:07:46.343
SAM: That hits. Go ahead.

02:07:46.343 --> 02:07:55.531
MARY: He gets 1d8 cold damage and his speed is
reduced by ten feet until the start of my next turn.

02:07:55.531 --> 02:07:57.473
SAM: That's very useful.

02:07:57.473 --> 02:08:12.416
MARY: Yes, so 1d6. Six! 1d8, motherfucker. Five!
Five damage, and he's reduced to ten feet.

02:08:12.416 --> 02:08:19.641
SAM: The cold blast hits him in the back squarely,
and even though it's a minor spell, you see him

02:08:19.641 --> 02:08:29.370
react way worse than you thought it would be. He
cries out with an inhuman shriek (shrieks) and

02:08:29.370 --> 02:08:39.897
seems to take even more damage than that. But he
continues on, slowly now. Because his non-feet

02:08:39.897 --> 02:08:51.377
feel slower. All right, go on. He is where he is.
That is Gryffin's turn. Next is-- I don't care

02:08:51.377 --> 02:09:00.805
about them. Jayne. Oh, sorry. There is a ranger
who's going to shoot somebody. I don't care. I'm

02:09:00.805 --> 02:09:13.477
rolling to see who she fires at, and I rolled
Jayne. Sorry, I rolled randomly. It's a plus-five,

02:09:13.477 --> 02:09:15.481
so that's eight plus five, 13.

02:09:15.481 --> 02:09:21.754
LIAM: I am 13, but until the spell ends, any
creature who targets the warded creature must make

02:09:21.754 --> 02:09:26.750
a wisdom save versus 14.

02:09:26.750 --> 02:09:31.584
SAM: Okay, versus 14. She fails that. She goes to
draw her bow on you.

02:09:31.584 --> 02:09:34.976
LIAM: Choose a new target or lose the attack.

02:09:34.976 --> 02:09:42.728
SAM: She chooses a new target. She chooses
Clothesline. She fires, and it's a one. She's so

02:09:42.728 --> 02:09:47.592
discombobulated that she hasn't hit anything
today. She sucks. Okay, now it's Jayne.

02:09:47.592 --> 02:09:55.340
LIAM: Okay, so I know that I can get within ten
feet. I'm going to take my fucking white whip and

02:09:55.340 --> 02:09:57.162
whip this guy in the fucking face.

02:09:57.162 --> 02:09:59.718
BRIAN: Violence is Jayne's addiction.

02:09:59.718 --> 02:10:06.664
LIAM: Ugh, no. It's bullshit. It's eight. It's
just an eight. That does not hit.

02:10:06.664 --> 02:10:10.987
SAM: The whip makes a wonderful crack, and nothing
else happens.

02:10:10.987 --> 02:10:23.680
LIAM: Fuck it! Then, for a bonus action, I'm going
to cast Chill Touch on both whoever this person is

02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:30.495
and Clothesline because I'm a death cleric and
part of my perks is that I can cast Chill Touch on

02:10:30.495 --> 02:10:38.164
two people next to each other instead of just one.
Two ghostly spectral hands fly out and latch onto

02:10:38.164 --> 02:10:48.346
both of their fucking faces. The targets must both
succeed on a dexterity saving throw versus 14.

02:10:48.346 --> 02:10:50.582
ASHLY: 14.

02:10:50.582 --> 02:10:52.096
LIAM: Fuck you, Ashly Burch!

02:10:52.096 --> 02:10:54.523
ASHLY: Fuck you! You betrayed me, you piece of
shit!

02:10:54.523 --> 02:10:56.235
SAM: You did it on the bad guy?

02:10:56.235 --> 02:10:57.254
LIAM: Yeah, both of them.

02:10:57.254 --> 02:10:58.197
SAM: 17.

02:10:58.197 --> 02:10:59.522
LIAM: Oh, then neither worked.

02:10:59.522 --> 02:11:04.240
ASHLY: Do I notice that this motherfucker did that
to me, though?

02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:10.073
SAM: Yeah, you see a blue spectral hand reach out
towards your face. It's super freaky. There's

02:11:10.073 --> 02:11:15.114
fingernails on it, and then it suddenly (gasp)
faces away. It's super weird, and it emerges from

02:11:15.114 --> 02:11:22.694
Jayne. While she cast the spell, it seems that her
lips go to the back a little bit, then become

02:11:22.694 --> 02:11:29.285
thinner. Her eyes narrow, and she has this
skeleton look for half a second as she casts the

02:11:29.285 --> 02:11:31.554
spell and then goes back to normal.

02:11:31.554 --> 02:11:33.614
LIAM: Oh, BFFs K-I-T!

02:11:33.614 --> 02:11:37.049
BRIAN: I'm terrified.

02:11:37.049 --> 02:11:42.399
SAM: Okay, that's Jayne. Next is-- oh, you've got
more?

02:11:42.399 --> 02:11:46.343
LIAM: Well, I can move back one space. That's it.

02:11:46.343 --> 02:11:48.895
SAM: Clothesline, what you got? Clothesline, what
you got?

02:11:48.895 --> 02:11:59.035
ASHLY: Hey, idiots. You want this little girl?
Talking to you. I'm talking to you. I'll help you.

02:11:59.035 --> 02:12:07.734
Fuck you, Jayne! I'm going to attack Jayne.

02:12:07.734 --> 02:12:09.779
SAM: Okay, go.

02:12:09.779 --> 02:12:11.904
LIAM: Sanctuary is still up.

02:12:11.904 --> 02:12:14.241
ASHLY: What does that mean?

02:12:14.241 --> 02:12:15.974
LIAM: I don't know. You don't know.

02:12:15.974 --> 02:12:18.386
SAM: Just do your attack first.

02:12:18.386 --> 02:12:28.879
ASHLY: Okay. I'm going to use my longsword, even
though I'm tempted to clothesline you. So that's 18.

02:12:28.879 --> 02:12:38.013
SAM: Okay, first make a wisdom saving throw, yeah.
So roll your d20. Add wisdom save.

02:12:38.013 --> 02:12:39.968
ASHLY: Seven.

02:12:39.968 --> 02:12:45.429
SAM: That's not great. So you feel the urge to
maybe hit somebody else.

02:12:45.429 --> 02:12:47.333
ASHLY: I'll hit the guy taking Holly.

02:12:47.333 --> 02:12:49.523
SAM: Okay, go for it. Roll again for your attack.

02:12:49.523 --> 02:12:53.377
ASHLY: That's a 14.

02:12:53.377 --> 02:12:59.781
SAM: Again, you are so distracted by what just
happened that your sword knocks over a bottle of

02:12:59.781 --> 02:13:03.911
Greep, which explodes, and this dude's now on
fire.

02:13:03.911 --> 02:13:06.091
ASHLY: Okay, as long as I'm not.

02:13:06.091 --> 02:13:13.505
SAM: "I don't have a name!" Okay, that's
Clothesline. Frankfurt, you're next.

02:13:13.505 --> 02:13:20.349
ERIC: I would like to attack the guy that's taking
Holly.

02:13:20.349 --> 02:13:25.784
SAM: So you're going to move towards him? All
right. With the speed of a Frankfurt, you move

02:13:25.784 --> 02:13:28.436
towards him, and you do something.

02:13:28.436 --> 02:13:32.583
ERIC: A pantsless Frankfurt. I would like to hit
him with the maul.

02:13:32.583 --> 02:13:33.969
SAM: Go for it.

02:13:33.969 --> 02:13:35.685
ERIC: 20-sided die?

02:13:35.685 --> 02:13:37.069
SAM: Yes, please.

02:13:37.069 --> 02:13:38.884
ERIC: 18.

02:13:38.884 --> 02:13:43.824
SAM: That hits. Go ahead and roll for damage. Your
maul does 2d6 plus six.

02:13:43.824 --> 02:13:53.877
LIAM: Yep, the square. The cube. Six! Plus. Roll
it again. Six!

02:13:53.877 --> 02:13:58.443
SAM: 18 points of damage. Oh shit.

02:13:58.443 --> 02:14:01.489
ERIC: Take that.

02:14:01.489 --> 02:14:12.771
SAM: Whoa. My god. The man with the girl is super
surprised. Oh wait. Even though you hit him with

02:14:12.771 --> 02:14:23.893
this insanely hard hit-- you connected real hard--
somehow, he shrugs it off and turns to you and

02:14:23.893 --> 02:14:28.650
sneers at you. He does take some damage, but it
doesn't seem like it's as much as you thought it would be.

02:14:28.650 --> 02:14:33.743
LIAM: But you got maximum damage on that attack,
which is rare.

02:14:33.743 --> 02:14:45.671
SAM: Okay. That was Frankfurt. Kingston, you're
up. While this is all happening, Obby says, "Obby

02:14:45.671 --> 02:14:50.472
"the Rat does not like this." And he leaves.

02:14:50.472 --> 02:14:52.976
MARY: Bye, Obby!

02:14:52.976 --> 02:14:54.441
BRIAN: Obby, goddamn.

02:14:54.441 --> 02:14:55.888
ERIC: Where you going?

02:14:55.888 --> 02:14:58.579
ASHLY: Love you, Obby. Nice to see you.

02:14:58.579 --> 02:15:05.754
BRIAN: Hey, does kidnapper guy seem hostile
towards anyone else?

02:15:05.754 --> 02:15:12.521
SAM: He has not even looked at anyone else.
Singularly focused on Holly, has not uttered a

02:15:12.521 --> 02:15:16.524
word, except he did turn around to look at
Frankfurt when he hit him,

02:15:16.524 --> 02:15:18.111
just because he was pissed.

02:15:18.111 --> 02:15:20.612
BRIAN: Can I try Blindness on Frankfurt again?

02:15:20.612 --> 02:15:23.906
SAM: Glad you've got your priorities right. Go for
it.

02:15:23.906 --> 02:15:27.376
BRIAN: Well, no one's attacking me. I don't give a
shit about this kid. I don't care about the guy

02:15:27.376 --> 02:15:29.959
taking the kid, but this guy fucked my wife.

02:15:29.959 --> 02:15:31.319
MARY: You fuck my wife?

02:15:31.319 --> 02:15:33.671
BRIAN: Did you shampoo my wife? Blindness.

02:15:33.671 --> 02:15:43.534
SAM: Go ahead. So your spell DC is 14, I think.
Eric, roll a d20. What's Blindness? Constitution?

02:15:43.534 --> 02:15:45.414
Or is it wisdom?

02:15:45.414 --> 02:15:51.879
BRIAN: It's going to be (singing) blinded by the
light, wrapped up a like a-- constitution.

02:15:51.879 --> 02:15:55.356
SAM: Constitution. Roll a d20, add your
constitution saving modifier.

02:15:55.356 --> 02:16:04.880
LIAM: Constitution. You've been rolling real well
tonight, Eric. And you still are. It's a 23 total.

02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:12.291
SAM: This tickle on the back of your neck again.
Nothing happens. You are blue-balling so hard for

02:16:12.291 --> 02:16:16.132
your spells. I hope you're marking these off. You
don't get infinite spells.

02:16:16.132 --> 02:16:23.633
BRIAN: I am marking them off, Samuel. (whispering)
Which ones have I used? I'm kidding.

02:16:23.633 --> 02:16:28.538
SAM: Any bonus actions? Anything else? Any
healing? You good, Brian?

02:16:28.538 --> 02:16:38.531
BRIAN: Oh, am I still on the other side of the
garlic nutsack? I would like to move to where that

02:16:38.531 --> 02:16:41.493
torch is over by the woman that's prone.

02:16:41.493 --> 02:16:43.108
SAM: You're moving away from the action.

02:16:43.108 --> 02:16:49.540
BRIAN: I would like to move away from the action
to the torch and face back towards the crowd. And

02:16:49.540 --> 02:16:54.864
as my bonus action, can I cast a cantrip as my
bonus action? Actually, you know what? I'm good.

02:16:54.864 --> 02:17:02.846
SAM: Great. Okay. Kidnapper guy with Holly makes
his way all the way to this trapdoor--

02:17:02.846 --> 02:17:06.996
MARY: Remember, he's only ten feet. He can only
move ten feet because I Ray of Frosted him.

02:17:06.996 --> 02:17:10.090
SAM: That's if his movement is 20, which it is
not.

02:17:10.090 --> 02:17:12.584
MARY: I thought it's move to ten.

02:17:12.584 --> 02:17:14.419
SAM: I thought you said it moves in half.

02:17:14.419 --> 02:17:16.199
MARY: Oh, it's reduced &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; ten.

02:17:16.199 --> 02:17:24.651
SAM: To ten? Shit. Well, then you are correct. So
let's say five, ten, uses his action to dash,

02:17:24.651 --> 02:17:26.500
five, ten.

02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:32.581
MARY: Oh, I'm sorry. You are right. It was reduced
&lt;i&gt;by&lt;/i&gt; ten feet until the start of my next turn.

02:17:32.581 --> 02:17:37.504
SAM: Then he's fine. He makes it there in one
clean dash, uses his bonus to flip open the

02:17:37.504 --> 02:17:46.434
trapdoor. Just for good measure, he touches this
guy, who hasn't done anything wrong and he takes--

02:17:46.434 --> 02:17:53.156
he's dead. Yeah. He dies.

02:17:53.156 --> 02:17:56.109
BRIAN: By what method did he kill him?

02:17:56.109 --> 02:18:02.406
SAM: He just touched him. The trapdoor is open,
and he is gone, and that's where we'll take our break.

02:18:02.406 --> 02:18:05.306
LIAM: Fuck that guy!

02:18:05.306 --> 02:18:10.461
SAM: Thank you so much for playing so far, guys.
We'll have more when we come back.

02:18:10.461 --> 02:18:14.765
(cheering and applause)

02:18:14.765 --> 02:18:21.526
LIAM: Just for the record, when I sat in the
chair, I'd at least directed-- DMed to

02:18:21.526 --> 02:18:26.991
eight-year-olds once or twice. Sam came in blind,
hot. So hot.

02:18:26.991 --> 02:18:35.240
BRIAN: Can I just say I now fully understand the
Travis knee shaking feverishly under the table? I

02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:36.668
now get it.

02:18:36.668 --> 02:18:38.979
SAM: Okay. So we're going to (voice breaking) give
away--

02:18:38.979 --> 02:18:43.535
(laughter)

02:18:43.535 --> 02:18:50.138
SAM: We're going to give away this-- our good
friends at CritRole. Not Wyrmwood. Our good

02:18:50.138 --> 02:18:54.423
friends at Wyrmwood have this beautiful dice
thing. I don't know what it's called. It's English

02:18:54.423 --> 02:19:01.657
wych wood. It is a elm burl hero vault, and we
will be giving this away to one lucky fan in the

02:19:01.657 --> 02:19:11.369
chatroom. The code word for winning this fine
thing is meow, M-E-O-W, meow. Please enter. We'll

02:19:11.369 --> 02:19:15.092
announce the winner after the break. Let's keep it
a quick break, guys. This is fun.

02:19:15.092 --> 02:19:20.333
(cheering)

02:19:20.333 --> 02:19:22.092
BRIAN: Eric Meowza.

02:19:22.092 --> 02:19:24.214
SAM: Yes. (sighs) Oh god.

02:19:24.214 --> 02:19:26.170
(laughter)

02:19:26.170 --> 02:19:28.520
MARY: Yay, Sam!

02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:30.286
SAM: Are we out? Come on.

02:19:30.286 --> 02:37:58.530
[break]

02:37:58.530 --> 02:37:59.990
LIAM: Clit-rota.

02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:01.737
SAM: I'm pretty sure that was on.

02:38:01.737 --> 02:38:04.563
ERIC: And we're back.

02:38:04.563 --> 02:38:11.301
SAM: And we're back! Congratulations to the winner
in chat of this fantabulous Critical Role English

02:38:11.301 --> 02:38:23.474
wych elm burl hero vault from Wyrmwood Gaming.
CholieAmenthys is the winner. Danoba will contact

02:38:23.569 --> 02:38:27.680
you shortly for your shipping information.
Congratulations and meow.

02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:29.798
LIAM: CholieAmenthys?

02:38:29.798 --> 02:38:32.609
SAM: Yeah, CholieAmenthys.

02:38:32.609 --> 02:38:34.898
LIAM: Punchy. Pithy.

02:38:34.898 --> 02:38:44.793
SAM: So guys, when last we left, a mysterious
figure, who emanated heat, had grabbed Holly, the

02:38:44.793 --> 02:38:53.894
little girl, who Frankfurt and Obby-- oh, we need
music-- were transporting, tore across the bar,

02:38:53.894 --> 02:39:00.261
and went down into this trapdoor. You are all
confused, looking around; there's still fights

02:39:00.261 --> 02:39:03.680
going on. What would you like to do? Go.

02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:06.912
LIAM: I'm moving towards the door immediately, the
trapdoor.

02:39:06.912 --> 02:39:11.306
MARY: Instantly. I grab Frankfurt, and off we go.

02:39:11.306 --> 02:39:15.579
SAM: Okay, so you're all converging around the
trap door. Kingston, are you with them?

02:39:15.579 --> 02:39:16.827
BRIAN: Yes.

02:39:16.827 --> 02:39:19.600
ASHLY: If everyone else is going to fucking do it,
then yeah.

02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:24.955
LIAM: As I walk, I'm casting Shield of Faith on
myself. It just boosts my AC, that's all.

02:39:24.955 --> 02:39:27.425
MARY: And I still have three bottles of Greep.

02:39:27.425 --> 02:39:36.356
SAM: Oh shit. Okay, you get to the top of the open
trapdoor, and look down into darkness.

02:39:36.356 --> 02:39:38.100
ASHLY: I can see in darkness.

02:39:38.100 --> 02:39:41.516
SAM: Sure, yeah. Many of you have darkvision. It's
okay, guys.

02:39:41.516 --> 02:39:44.619
ASHLY: I got really excited that I had an ability
to do.

02:39:44.619 --> 02:39:47.460
BRIAN: I became Laura for a second. "Actually--"

02:39:47.460 --> 02:39:50.722
SAM: Clothesline has no pants. Both of your
genitals are exposed.

02:39:50.722 --> 02:39:52.768
ASHLY: Free and clear in the wind.

02:39:52.768 --> 02:40:00.722
SAM: So who's going first? Who's going second? Are
you going to talk to each other at all? You're

02:40:00.722 --> 02:40:05.538
just going to go? Are you going to hit each other?
What's happening? Anyone want to go in first?

02:40:05.538 --> 02:40:09.966
LIAM: I'm going to kick the bard in the ass, and
when I kick him in the ass, I'm going to cast

02:40:09.966 --> 02:40:12.601
Light on his ass as he falls down into the hole.

02:40:12.601 --> 02:40:14.591
SAM: You can cast Light on an ass?

02:40:14.591 --> 02:40:22.419
LIAM: It's anything I touch, and it's a cantrip,
so his ass lights up as he falls down the hole.

02:40:22.419 --> 02:40:25.359
SAM: All right, so yes. Kingston, you fall in
first.

02:40:25.359 --> 02:40:28.278
BRIAN: Am I like propeller guy in Titanic?

02:40:28.278 --> 02:40:33.836
SAM: Sure. Yep. In fact, roll an athletics check.

02:40:33.836 --> 02:40:36.758
BRIAN: Okay, thought that'd be great. All right,
let's use Gil.

02:40:36.758 --> 02:40:38.853
SAM: Or acrobatics, whatever's higher for you.

02:40:38.853 --> 02:40:42.476
BRIAN: Well, you made the print so goddamn small
on my character sheet.

02:40:42.476 --> 02:40:46.438
SAM: Sorry. Acrobatics is probably higher for
you.

02:40:46.438 --> 02:40:54.141
BRIAN: Don't fuck me, Gil! Oh wow. Acrobatics?
Let's go ahead and call that a 22.

02:40:54.141 --> 02:41:00.843
SAM: Whoa, shit. You're familiar with this tavern
and all of its layout because you live here, so

02:41:00.843 --> 02:41:06.562
you land like a cat in a three-point landing at
the foot of this darkened ladder/stairs.

02:41:06.562 --> 02:41:09.136
BRIAN: If you don't realize, I'm into cats.

02:41:09.136 --> 02:41:12.348
SAM: How long does Light last, by the way?

02:41:12.348 --> 02:41:14.410
LIAM: Oh, let's see how long that lasts.

02:41:14.410 --> 02:41:16.470
BRIAN: Do I feel a sensation on my bum?

02:41:16.470 --> 02:41:19.495
LIAM: One hour. So Kingston's ass is lit up.

02:41:19.495 --> 02:41:20.875
SAM: Is it concentration or anything?

02:41:20.875 --> 02:41:23.758
LIAM: No, it's a really easy spell for many of
us.

02:41:23.758 --> 02:41:34.978
BRIAN: My ass is a beam of light for one hour? A
beacon of light for one hour? Can I bend over and

02:41:34.978 --> 02:41:36.435
blind an enemy?

02:41:36.435 --> 02:41:46.646
SAM: If you shove your ass close to them, it would
probably affect them at some point. So you are a

02:41:46.646 --> 02:41:53.207
lightning bug, and your ass is illuminating this
whole space down here. Where did the figures go, Liam?

02:41:53.207 --> 02:41:57.582
LIAM: On your other side, Sam.

02:41:57.582 --> 02:42:02.586
SAM: Oh, there they are. Let's place you guys
around somewhere, haphazardly. Oh god, this

02:42:02.586 --> 02:42:04.809
thing's so far. I can't do it.

02:42:04.809 --> 02:42:09.834
LIAM: I'll help. Are they here or are they here?
What's our marching order, DM?

02:42:09.834 --> 02:42:12.137
SAM: There's no marching order; it's a room.

02:42:12.137 --> 02:42:16.219
LIAM: We shoved the bard down first. I'll go after
him.

02:42:16.219 --> 02:42:21.389
SAM: He fell down, so he's over here, you guys
can-- who wants to go next?

02:42:21.389 --> 02:42:30.283
ASHLY: Wait. I don't want this fucking thing,
whatever it is, Creepy McCreeperson over here.

02:42:30.283 --> 02:42:37.250
Excuse me! You took your little icy tentacles and
tried to put them on the back of my head! We need

02:42:37.250 --> 02:42:38.620
to restrain her. Something.

02:42:38.620 --> 02:42:44.418
BRIAN: As I'm falling, I sing, (singing) Let my ass lighten
the way.

02:42:44.418 --> 02:42:48.900
SAM and BRIAN: (singing) To your heart.

02:42:48.900 --> 02:42:54.484
SAM: Okay, is anyone going to follow Clothesline's
suggestion?

02:42:54.484 --> 02:42:57.211
ASHLY: Anybody? You want her just roaming around?

02:42:57.211 --> 02:43:00.565
MARY: My concern is for other things at the
moment.

02:43:00.565 --> 02:43:03.392
ERIC: She hasn't done anything to me.

02:43:03.392 --> 02:43:12.545
BRIAN: What happened to your necklace? Wait, I
couldn't talk to him, I'm falling down a tunnel

02:43:12.545 --> 02:43:14.466
with my ass made of light.

02:43:14.466 --> 02:43:18.341
SAM: You're at the bottom, and Jayne is coming
down the steps right behind you.

02:43:18.341 --> 02:43:20.071
MARY: What do you see down there?

02:43:20.071 --> 02:43:24.867
LIAM: We have something to do. You can ask me lots
of questions later. Let's just kill the thing and

02:43:24.867 --> 02:43:26.480
get the girl, all right?

02:43:26.480 --> 02:43:28.704
BRIAN: Do you know what this thing is?

02:43:28.704 --> 02:43:31.783
LIAM: I do not.

02:43:31.783 --> 02:43:34.616
BRIAN: Do you know who the girl is?

02:43:34.616 --> 02:43:37.370
LIAM: Sort of.

02:43:37.370 --> 02:43:42.557
BRIAN: Tell me, and I'll give you some of
Gryffin's Greep.

02:43:42.557 --> 02:43:46.882
SAM: As you talk, you all make it down there
slowly, filling the room.

02:43:46.882 --> 02:43:50.510
LIAM: I walk past the idiot and start walking down
the hallway.

02:43:50.510 --> 02:43:54.986
BRIAN: Piece of shit. I cast Talk to Me at Once!

02:43:54.986 --> 02:44:05.056
SAM: I could pull it towards me. It's going to
wreck some microphones over there. Okay. I should

02:44:05.056 --> 02:44:08.975
tell you, before you start walking, at the foot of
the stairs there's a single lantern casting a dim

02:44:08.975 --> 02:44:13.249
glow, although that doesn't matter because you've
got Light coming out of your ass. On the walls are

02:44:13.249 --> 02:44:18.450
graffiti, seemingly from patrons who've wandered
down here. One reads, "For a good time, do not

02:44:18.450 --> 02:44:24.155
"call Isabelle." Another reads, "Do you know why
they call him Obby the Rat? Because his dick is

02:44:24.155 --> 02:44:31.186
"the size of a rodent." And the other one says,
"What do you call a pile of tabaxi? A Meowntain."

02:44:31.186 --> 02:44:33.970
BRIAN: Respect.

02:44:33.970 --> 02:44:39.140
SAM: Straight on at the bottom of the steps, a
narrow corridor leading out around a slight

02:44:39.140 --> 02:44:45.158
bend, obscuring the view. To the other direction,
it's a dead wall, however there is a space

02:44:45.158 --> 02:44:51.147
underneath the back of the stairway. It is dank
and cold. Light frost covers the floor, because

02:44:51.147 --> 02:44:55.482
you are out of that hot bar, now. So you would like
to continue down this hall?

02:44:55.482 --> 02:45:03.998
LIAM: Yeah, I'm looking as carefully as I can into
the next space. I will peer for enemies or the

02:45:03.998 --> 02:45:06.126
people we're following or anything.

02:45:06.126 --> 02:45:21.140
SAM: Okay. This curves this way and leads to a
door. The corridor proceeds around to the left. As

02:45:21.140 --> 02:45:28.713
you proceed through it, Clothesline has to bend a
little to make it through. Frankfurt feels roomy.

02:45:28.713 --> 02:45:36.336
It ends with a simple wooden door and a rusty
knob. Are you still in the same marching order?

02:45:36.336 --> 02:45:38.170
Kingston first or Kingston second?

02:45:38.170 --> 02:45:42.312
LIAM: I call down over my shoulder and say: hey,
ass kicker!

02:45:42.312 --> 02:45:43.561
SAM: That's you.

02:45:43.561 --> 02:45:46.076
LIAM: No, it's not. Clothesline, get up here.

02:45:46.076 --> 02:45:47.654
BRIAN: I'm ass flicker.

02:45:47.654 --> 02:45:50.532
ASHLY: Fuck you! I don't follow your orders. You
tried to kill me!

02:45:50.532 --> 02:45:53.077
MARY: I want to investigate what's under the
stairs.

02:45:53.077 --> 02:45:55.919
ASHLY: I don't even know why I'm still here!

02:45:55.919 --> 02:46:01.551
SAM: So nobody is going with you right now, Jayne.
You're in front of a door. Gryffin, can you roll

02:46:01.551 --> 02:46:04.646
an investigation check?

02:46:04.646 --> 02:46:09.263
LIAM: And I'm going to do my best to see if
there's any kind of trap on the door I'm looking at.

02:46:09.263 --> 02:46:14.775
MARY: 18.

02:46:14.775 --> 02:46:26.123
SAM: 18. Yes. All right. There is a false wall
here that opens up into another corridor that

02:46:26.123 --> 02:46:36.840
leads this way. Let me see how I described it.
Yes. Okay. It empties out into a wider room, and

02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:40.957
I'm going to do this. All right, so what would you
like to do?

02:46:40.957 --> 02:46:44.801
MARY: Can I check to see if there's any trace of
footprints or anything?

02:46:44.801 --> 02:46:47.929
SAM: Sure, roll a perception check.

02:46:47.929 --> 02:46:56.460
MARY: (winces) I'm not going to waste that though.
Ten.

02:46:56.460 --> 02:47:03.405
SAM: Ten? That's what you needed. So there is
frost everywhere. It's super cold down here,

02:47:03.405 --> 02:47:10.297
because we're underground in a cellar area, and
it's winter. Yeah, now you're also getting cold.

02:47:10.297 --> 02:47:12.050
BRIAN: I don't have a fucking shirt on!

02:47:12.050 --> 02:47:14.543
MARY: Your nipples are rock-hard.

02:47:14.543 --> 02:47:16.330
BRIAN: Good thing they're pierced.

02:47:16.330 --> 02:47:21.253
SAM: Gryffin, you notice that there's less frost
on the floor under the stairs and through this

02:47:21.253 --> 02:47:24.614
hallway than on the rest of the downstairs area.

02:47:24.614 --> 02:47:26.689
MARY: Are there any footprints that I can see?

02:47:26.689 --> 02:47:34.078
SAM: There are no footprints. If anything it's
just a straight line. You also notice something

02:47:34.078 --> 02:47:39.057
else: two things, actually. Would you like the one
on the left or the one on the right?

02:47:39.057 --> 02:47:40.770
MARY: Left, please.

02:47:40.770 --> 02:47:43.774
SAM: Left? Read that out loud.

02:47:43.774 --> 02:47:50.319
MARY: Oh, there's a fucking snake on the left!
Oops, a fucking snake just bit me. I take one

02:47:50.319 --> 02:47:57.834
point damage and I make a constitution save
versus ten.

02:47:57.834 --> 02:48:01.889
ASHLY: It literally says "a fucking snake" by the
way.

02:48:01.995 --> 02:48:10.881
MARY: Constitution, which, okay. Ten.

02:48:10.881 --> 02:48:15.286
SAM: That saves. You're fine. Just one point of
damage.

02:48:15.286 --> 02:48:18.555
MARY: Goddamn it! And I step on the fucking
snake.

02:48:18.555 --> 02:48:21.404
SAM: It's dead. Would you like the thing on the
right?

02:48:21.404 --> 02:48:29.915
MARY: Yes. Another fucking snake. Whoa! I will
take that.

02:48:29.915 --> 02:48:35.172
SAM: Okay. Do you proceed into this room or do you
hang out?

02:48:35.172 --> 02:48:43.602
MARY: I turn around and I say: kitty-kitty, there
seems to be another room down here and it seems to

02:48:43.602 --> 02:48:48.522
me that the frost is dissipating a bit on the
floor. What do you think we should do? There's no

02:48:48.522 --> 02:48:52.157
sign of footprints, but I don't know that there
were footprints on the other way. Jayne, do you

02:48:52.157 --> 02:48:54.762
see footprints? Besides your own, of course.

02:48:54.762 --> 02:48:58.357
LIAM: I'm looking at the door in front of me and
seeing if I can see anything hinky with it.

02:48:58.357 --> 02:49:00.480
SAM: Sure. Make an investigation check.

02:49:00.480 --> 02:49:01.861
LIAM: Natural 20.

02:49:01.861 --> 02:49:05.439
SAM: The door is not locked and not trapped.

02:49:05.439 --> 02:49:07.824
LIAM: Well, I'm going to go inside.

02:49:07.824 --> 02:49:17.383
SAM: You're so freaky. It's a rather long room
with boxes everywhere. Seems to be some sort of

02:49:17.383 --> 02:49:28.706
storage area. In the middle is a table with
potions and beakers on it. A closet over here. It

02:49:28.706 --> 02:49:35.512
is not lit at all. Let's see what I said about it.
A single lantern glows near the door, casting dark

02:49:35.512 --> 02:49:42.485
shadows everywhere. Stacked boxes all around.
Weirdly, the smell of cabbage permeates the air.

02:49:42.485 --> 02:49:46.846
In the center of the room, a wooden table
resembling a crude chemistry lab. Beakers and

02:49:46.846 --> 02:49:53.675
vials are arranged. A whiff of something strange
hits you. It stings your nose like gasoline. Would

02:49:53.675 --> 02:49:56.922
you like to look around?

02:49:56.922 --> 02:50:00.260
LIAM: I would first like to cast Light again,
because it's a cantrip, I can do it as many times

02:50:00.260 --> 02:50:08.826
as I want, and that means the bard's ass goes out
and I'll say that the grip of my whip lights up

02:50:08.826 --> 02:50:10.652
and I hold it upside down.

02:50:10.652 --> 02:50:13.742
SAM: That's so cool. So you've got a white whip
that's lit up.

02:50:13.742 --> 02:50:16.664
MARY: So it's finally useful, is it?

02:50:16.664 --> 02:50:19.444
LIAM: You're not there.

02:50:19.444 --> 02:50:23.489
MARY: That was Zahra showing up for a moment.

02:50:23.489 --> 02:50:27.332
LIAM: You said there were potions on the table
that I see now.

02:50:27.332 --> 02:50:29.200
SAM: You can investigate that, yeah.

02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:31.529
ASHLY: Is it possible for me at some point to try
to grapple her?

02:50:31.529 --> 02:50:36.861
SAM: To grapple Jayne? If you want to walk down
the hall, you can try.

02:50:36.861 --> 02:50:44.161
LIAM: I've entered the room and I want to inspect
the potions you said there were on the table?

02:50:44.161 --> 02:50:45.874
SAM: Okay, roll an investigation check.

02:50:45.874 --> 02:50:48.491
ASHLY: Can I move toward the room?

02:50:48.491 --> 02:50:50.153
SAM: Sure.

02:50:50.153 --> 02:50:52.556
ASHLY: And try to grapple Jayne?

02:50:52.556 --> 02:50:54.172
LIAM: Ten.

02:50:54.172 --> 02:51:00.166
SAM: Okay, ten is what you needed. Upon further
inspection, you use your light to reveal the

02:51:00.166 --> 02:51:06.069
labels on the jugs. Someone has been mixing liquor
down here. After a minute of study, you figure out

02:51:06.069 --> 02:51:11.992
that the house alcohol, Greep, is made right here,
and the formula is remarkably basic. It is four

02:51:11.992 --> 02:51:19.113
parts standard rice wine, one part balsamic
vinegar, one part simple syrup, and one part pure

02:51:19.113 --> 02:51:25.622
kerosene. Everyone who has drank it has been
drinking kerosene the whole night.

02:51:25.622 --> 02:51:30.837
LIAM: I jot that down on a scrap of paper and put
it away, because I am a businesswoman, as well.

02:51:30.837 --> 02:51:34.990
SAM: That's it. That's all you find, currently.

02:51:34.990 --> 02:51:39.483
LIAM: Okay. I will start back and find the
catwoman in the doorway.

02:51:39.483 --> 02:51:42.384
SAM: Okay. Catwoman, what would you like to do?

02:51:42.384 --> 02:51:48.007
ASHLY: Hi, Jayne. And I would like to grapple her
by the neck and hold her aloft.

02:51:48.007 --> 02:51:49.565
MARY: Oh hi, Jayne.

02:51:49.565 --> 02:51:53.427
SAM: How's Sanctuary going? Still on?

02:51:53.427 --> 02:51:57.936
LIAM: It's up to you. If ten minutes have passed
since I cast it?

02:51:57.936 --> 02:52:04.792
SAM: It has not been ten minutes. So you'll have
to make a wisdom saving throw against 14.

02:52:04.792 --> 02:52:07.863
ASHLY: Shit. Well, she's not very smart so she
would try. Natural 20.

02:52:07.863 --> 02:52:13.104
LIAM: That's the third one for Burch!

02:52:13.104 --> 02:52:18.935
SAM: So sadly, that does not mean that you
grapple. That means that you have the fortitude to

02:52:18.935 --> 02:52:20.383
attempt to grapple.

02:52:20.383 --> 02:52:28.233
ASHLY: It'd be really sad if it fails right now. I
got a nine. Is there anything I could apply to it?

02:52:28.233 --> 02:52:31.251
SAM: Yeah, strength, and you're pretty strong.

02:52:31.251 --> 02:52:32.726
ASHLY: So it's 12.

02:52:32.726 --> 02:52:35.607
SAM: Wait, three? Your strength is three? No, it's
not.

02:52:35.607 --> 02:52:36.960
ASHLY: Plus three modifier?

02:52:36.960 --> 02:52:38.696
SAM: Really? I thought you were stronger than
that.

02:52:38.696 --> 02:52:40.507
ASHLY: Wait, or is it this one? Saving throw?

02:52:40.507 --> 02:52:41.669
SAM: No, you're right.

02:52:41.669 --> 02:52:44.472
LIAM: And I have to roll versus it. So you got a
what total?

02:52:44.472 --> 02:52:45.905
SAM: 12.

02:52:45.905 --> 02:52:49.416
LIAM: That's a big four.

02:52:49.416 --> 02:52:52.830
(laughter)

02:52:52.830 --> 02:52:58.821
BRIAN: I'm still so used to Liam rolling and then
going: 196.

02:52:58.821 --> 02:53:04.272
LIAM: The big thing tonight is I'm like: luck--
no. Phantom limb syndrome.

02:53:04.272 --> 02:53:10.108
SAM: Okay, so you are grappled and restrained. You
both can't move or anything, unless you want to

02:53:10.108 --> 02:53:12.067
try to drag her somewhere.

02:53:12.067 --> 02:53:19.950
ASHLY: I want to be like: what the fuck, man? You
brought me here. I'm doing you a favor. Why did

02:53:19.950 --> 02:53:21.838
you try to fucking kill me?

02:53:21.838 --> 02:53:25.957
LIAM: (strained) It was probably a bad idea.

02:53:25.957 --> 02:53:32.789
ASHLY: Bad idea, yeah. So? How are you going to
make it up to me?

02:53:32.789 --> 02:53:39.896
LIAM: (strained) I think you need to kill me
later. I think we need to survive this basement.

02:53:39.896 --> 02:53:44.387
ASHLY: I don't give a fuck about this girl or
anything going on with you, so if you don't want

02:53:44.387 --> 02:53:48.122
to die right now, or have me leave and fucking
feed you to these dogs--

02:53:48.122 --> 02:53:50.212
LIAM: We're talking a long time. Can I cast a
spell?

02:53:50.212 --> 02:53:51.960
SAM: Sure, yeah.

02:53:51.960 --> 02:53:59.553
LIAM: I would like to cast Inflict Wounds at
second level. Make a melee spell attack against a

02:53:59.553 --> 02:54:09.167
creature you reach. Okay. She's done. That is
a 19 plus six. That is a 25.

02:54:09.167 --> 02:54:11.133
SAM: What does this spell do?

02:54:11.133 --> 02:54:14.995
LIAM: This is Inflict Wounds. Make a melee spell
attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit,

02:54:14.995 --> 02:54:26.954
the target takes 3d10 necrotic damage. Except I'm
doing it at second level, so it's 4d10. And so my

02:54:26.954 --> 02:54:42.943
hand just grips her forearm and death filters
through it. Ten. 19. 29.

02:54:43.012 --> 02:55:05.803
ASHLY and MARY: (singing) I have three hit points,
just three hit points. I am about to die.

02:55:05.803 --> 02:55:08.884
SAM: That was beautiful. And sad.

02:55:08.884 --> 02:55:10.686
LIAM: Not even the bard.

02:55:10.686 --> 02:55:11.807
ASHLY: You know what?

02:55:11.807 --> 02:55:14.729
SAM: All right, so you are released, Jayne, from
her grapple.

02:55:14.729 --> 02:55:20.348
ASHLY: Whatever you want to do is fine. That was
fine. Everything is fine. What do you need, buddy?

02:55:20.348 --> 02:55:27.476
BRIAN: Can I do something? Since we're all in the
same area. Am I standing next to Frankfurt?

02:55:27.476 --> 02:55:33.454
ERIC: Ah, Jesus! It's freezing down here.

02:55:33.454 --> 02:55:43.688
ASHLY: I have two hit points left! I'm bad at
math. I have two hit points left. So am I knocked out?

02:55:43.688 --> 02:55:50.992
LIAM: No, you're awake, you motherfucker!

02:55:50.992 --> 02:55:53.335
SAM: You are feeling really shitty right now.

02:55:53.335 --> 02:55:56.784
BRIAN: Wait! Did she do the 1d6 to her attack for
the bardic inspiration that I gave you?

02:55:56.784 --> 02:55:58.365
MARY: She hasn't used it yet.

02:55:58.365 --> 02:56:00.948
LIAM: That's water under the bridge, Brain.

02:56:00.948 --> 02:56:03.635
BRIAN: Fuck the bridge!

02:56:03.635 --> 02:56:06.267
MARY: Use it next time for something!

02:56:06.267 --> 02:56:14.284
BRIAN: Okay. Can I force myself to throw up Greep
onto him? It says I have a candle, can I then

02:56:14.284 --> 02:56:19.818
light that candle and light Frankfurt on fire
because I threw Greep up on to him?

02:56:19.818 --> 02:56:22.737
SAM: I mean, you can certainly make an attempt.

02:56:22.737 --> 02:56:24.915
MARY: That's 3,000 actions.

02:56:24.915 --> 02:56:30.355
LIAM: Gagging your ass and then lighting a candle
seems like possibly three actions.

02:56:30.355 --> 02:56:36.039
BRIAN: Have you ever had someone with a gnome
bard-sized penis steal your wife from you?

02:56:36.039 --> 02:56:43.041
SAM: So many times. Go ahead and make a
constitution saving throw to see if you can make

02:56:43.041 --> 02:56:45.118
yourself throw up.

02:56:45.118 --> 02:56:48.445
LIAM: DND is all about negotiation.

02:56:48.445 --> 02:56:57.914
BRIAN: Constitution saving. We're going to go with
a 12-- or no, 11.

02:56:57.914 --> 02:57:04.152
SAM: You stick your fingers down your throat to
throw up, but it doesn't work. You gag and dry

02:57:04.152 --> 02:57:07.301
heave for a while, and nothing comes up,
unfortunately.

02:57:07.301 --> 02:57:09.652
BRIAN: So a typical night at the tavern.

02:57:09.652 --> 02:57:15.286
MARY: All right, you two, would you stop it for
the moment? Seriously. We have a mission here, or

02:57:15.286 --> 02:57:19.173
at least you and I have a mission and I do not
want to-- Look, Kingston, I love your work, I

02:57:19.173 --> 02:57:22.896
really do and I realize that you're a fantastic
writer and everything else, but there are other

02:57:22.896 --> 02:57:27.905
things to do right now. There is a room underneath
the stairs. Shall we check it out? It gets

02:57:27.905 --> 02:57:29.803
increasingly warmer, it seems.

02:57:29.803 --> 02:57:32.130
BRIAN: Are the elderly whores in there?

02:57:32.130 --> 02:57:35.233
MARY: Yes! They most certainly are.

02:57:35.233 --> 02:57:36.666
BRIAN: Let's go.

02:57:36.666 --> 02:57:39.745
MARY: (whispering) Frankfurt, come with me and
we'll get to her. Yes.

02:57:39.745 --> 02:57:44.779
SAM: Who's going down there? You three?

02:57:44.779 --> 02:57:46.083
ERIC: Yeah.

02:57:46.083 --> 02:57:48.632
MARY: The others split up and go rogue. Whoa!

02:57:48.632 --> 02:57:56.328
SAM: As you walk in, you see that the walls of
this part of the tunnel are rough as if they had

02:57:56.328 --> 02:58:01.377
been clawed out of the rocks. It's very cold; you
can see your breath as you enter. It's also pitch

02:58:01.377 --> 02:58:09.824
black because light is gone. Those of you with
darkvision can faintly see that this tunnel-- I'm

02:58:09.824 --> 02:58:14.679
going to skip that part, in the interest of time.
That this tunnel continues into darkness for a

02:58:14.679 --> 02:58:22.896
wide oval anteroom. It's a bit oddly shaped to be
a storage room; it's about 20 feet wide with a 15

02:58:22.896 --> 02:58:24.635
foot coved ceiling.

02:58:24.635 --> 02:58:31.425
BRIAN: My ass is an hour?

02:58:31.425 --> 02:58:33.479
SAM: When he cast Light, it went out.

02:58:33.479 --> 02:58:35.143
MARY: Oh. Can I cast Light?

02:58:35.143 --> 02:58:41.502
SAM: Sure, if you would like to? Okay. Things look
nice and bright in here. Four evenly spaced

02:58:41.502 --> 02:58:50.396
pillars are holding up the ceiling, each with
intricate, beautiful carvings. At the other side

02:58:50.396 --> 02:58:56.666
of the room is a single large door. The door seems
to be made of heavy forged iron, with carefully

02:58:56.666 --> 02:59:04.346
inlaid bronze details: images of fire and lizard
tongues. Who would like to do anything or walk

02:59:04.346 --> 02:59:07.127
around or enter? What do you want to do?

02:59:07.127 --> 02:59:10.028
LIAM: While they're thinking about it, can I
talk to the cat?

02:59:10.028 --> 02:59:13.709
SAM: Sure, go ahead.

02:59:13.709 --> 02:59:15.920
LIAM: I'm not a very nice person.

02:59:15.920 --> 02:59:17.452
ASHLY: (strained) I'm gathering that.

02:59:17.452 --> 02:59:31.576
LIAM: Yes. I am a servant of the Chained Oblivion,
and I want &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; destroyed. And I know that

02:59:31.576 --> 02:59:37.631
doesn't sync up with your motivation. That's
rough. But I could kill you now.

02:59:37.631 --> 02:59:38.962
ASHLY: Sure, yeah.

02:59:38.962 --> 02:59:44.811
LIAM: Or you could come with me and help me get
this girl. And then maybe you'll make your way out

02:59:44.811 --> 02:59:51.208
of it. Maybe you'll survive. I'm going to give you
a chance because I think you're worth more to me

02:59:51.208 --> 03:00:02.211
alive now than dead. And if you're very nice and
don't argue, I'll even make you feel a little

03:00:02.211 --> 03:00:05.482
better. What do you say?

03:00:05.482 --> 03:00:09.759
ASHLY: That sounds great. It's cool. I'm good.
We're good. Yeah.

03:00:09.759 --> 03:00:13.332
LIAM: Clothesline, I'm not a nice person.

03:00:13.332 --> 03:00:16.923
ASHLY: I get it! I got it from the time when you
almost killed me, yeah. I got it. I'm good.

03:00:16.923 --> 03:00:32.075
LIAM: I facepalm her and cast Cure Wounds. That
is-- I'll tell you. That is eight hit points back

03:00:32.075 --> 03:00:34.511
for you. Hooray, eight, hey!

03:00:34.511 --> 03:00:40.982
ASHLY: Hey, ugh. (coughs) I would say thanks, but
I'm not going to argue. What do you need?

03:00:40.982 --> 03:00:46.188
LIAM: You can try to kill me later. I want the
little red-haired girl, you understand?

03:00:46.188 --> 03:00:49.754
ASHLY: Yeah. Red-haired girl. Got it. Got it,
boss.

03:00:49.754 --> 03:00:50.934
LIAM: Come on.

03:00:50.934 --> 03:00:53.431
SAM: So you join the others?

03:00:53.431 --> 03:00:55.179
LIAM: I'll follow her.

03:00:55.179 --> 03:01:00.246
SAM: All right. So who is looking around the room,
doing something?

03:01:00.246 --> 03:01:01.866
MARY: Can we check for traps?

03:01:01.866 --> 03:01:07.346
SAM: Sure. Make an investigation check. What are
you checking for traps?

03:01:07.346 --> 03:01:09.883
MARY and SAM: The floor.

03:01:09.883 --> 03:01:16.470
BRIAN: You said there was shit written on the
pillar? Can I see if I recognize any of the

03:01:16.470 --> 03:01:17.969
symbols on the pillar?

03:01:17.969 --> 03:01:20.419
SAM: Sure. What languages do you speak?

03:01:20.419 --> 03:01:25.338
BRIAN: I speak Common, Elven, Halfling, Valley
Girl.

03:01:25.338 --> 03:01:30.600
SAM: What was your check, Mary?

03:01:30.600 --> 03:01:34.467
MARY: 18. And I speak Elvish, Abysmal and Common.

03:01:34.467 --> 03:01:44.351
SAM: Abyssal. You're looking at the floor
specifically? Okay. Brian, can you roll an

03:01:44.351 --> 03:01:52.170
investigation check? Okay, so Mary, looking on the
floor you do not see any tiles or anything. It is

03:01:52.170 --> 03:02:00.054
smooth, like poured cement. Seemingly no
traps on the floor. Glancing about the room,

03:02:00.054 --> 03:02:06.244
though, as you step in and sort of use your light
to look around-- you rolled an 18, you said? You

03:02:06.244 --> 03:02:13.496
see cobwebs and grime and dust all over the place.
It's not a very used room. But on the ceiling you

03:02:13.496 --> 03:02:21.720
do notice faint symbols covered in years of
cobwebs and grime. Brian, what did you roll?

03:02:21.720 --> 03:02:25.035
BRIAN: Was it an investigation? 18.

03:02:25.035 --> 03:02:31.986
SAM: Okay. So you cannot read any writing on
these-- you're investigating the pillars? You

03:02:31.986 --> 03:02:35.076
can't read any writing on them, but it's okay
because there's not really any.

03:02:35.076 --> 03:02:37.012
BRIAN: Do I recognize the symbols?

03:02:37.012 --> 03:02:42.709
SAM: There are symbols of serpents carved up and
down on these pillars, way nicer than they need to

03:02:42.709 --> 03:02:48.356
be, and you can see from your excellent
investigation skill that the eyes of the serpents

03:02:48.356 --> 03:02:52.300
have a faint glow of magic in them. They are
definitely trapped.

03:02:52.300 --> 03:03:03.234
BRIAN: We got some weird snake shit going on over
here, guys. I don't want to touch it, but I would

03:03:03.234 --> 03:03:04.952
like it if one of you did.

03:03:04.952 --> 03:03:09.158
MARY: I was bitten by a snake on the way in, so I
would recommend not touching any of the snakes.

03:03:09.158 --> 03:03:13.870
BRIAN: Maybe you're immune now that it bit you and
you could just go touch it and press one of the

03:03:13.870 --> 03:03:17.075
eyes and maybe it won't do anything to you. I
recommend trying all the eyes.

03:03:17.075 --> 03:03:21.505
MARY: It would make such a good story, though, in
your book if you did it, Kingston.

03:03:21.505 --> 03:03:27.890
BRIAN: Oh, I know, but if it goes bad, who will be
around to write the book? Surely a fan such as

03:03:27.890 --> 03:03:30.127
yourself would be dedicated enough to--

03:03:30.127 --> 03:03:32.338
MARY: Did you always write your books or did you
have a ghostwriter?

03:03:32.338 --> 03:03:35.972
BRIAN: Oh, I didn't have a ghostwriter. Are you
kidding me? The pain that I went through. I was

03:03:35.972 --> 03:03:38.536
able to pull from so many different places.

03:03:38.536 --> 03:03:41.880
ASHLY: Could I also do a perception check? Do I
see the symbols on the ceiling?

03:03:41.880 --> 03:03:43.690
SAM: Not yet, not until you roll.

03:03:43.690 --> 03:03:45.941
ASHLY: That is a 19.

03:03:45.941 --> 03:03:50.622
SAM: You definitely see the symbols on the
ceiling. They're all over the place, many of them.

03:03:50.622 --> 03:03:57.429
They appear to be writing in Common. They appear
to be numbers. Lots and lots of numbers. Also,

03:03:57.429 --> 03:04:04.676
glancing about the room you've entered now, behind
this pillar back here you find something. Heads or tails?

03:04:04.676 --> 03:04:07.806
ASHLY: Oh! Tails. Because I'm a cat!

03:04:07.806 --> 03:04:15.944
SAM: Here you go. All right, so that is something
you find.

03:04:15.944 --> 03:04:17.383
MARY: How high is the ceiling?

03:04:17.383 --> 03:04:26.797
SAM: The ceiling is whatever I said before: 25
foot coved ceiling. 25 feet high. And it's covered

03:04:26.797 --> 03:04:30.777
with numbers. They're all hard to make out because
it's dusty.

03:04:30.777 --> 03:04:42.743
MARY: Numbers, huh? I have a feeling we're going
to have to touch one of those.

03:04:42.743 --> 03:04:45.008
ASHLY: Is anyone good with numbers? I'm not great
with numbers.

03:04:45.008 --> 03:04:47.644
BRIAN: And I'm drunk.

03:04:47.644 --> 03:04:51.500
SAM: Okay. From the other side of the door you
hear a girl scream.

03:04:51.500 --> 03:04:52.970
MARY: At the end?

03:04:52.970 --> 03:04:53.966
SAM: Yes.

03:04:53.966 --> 03:04:55.337
MARY: Oh balls. All right.

03:04:55.337 --> 03:04:58.536
BRIAN: That end? Oh shit.

03:04:58.536 --> 03:05:02.234
ASHLY: Hey creepy girl! Are you good with
numbers?

03:05:02.234 --> 03:05:10.840
LIAM: No, but I have other skills. I would like to
cast Command on the dwarf. He has to make a wisdom

03:05:10.840 --> 03:05:19.687
saving throw. So roll the d20 plus three.

03:05:19.687 --> 03:05:23.351
ERIC: Are you allowed to do this? Is he allowed to
do this?

03:05:23.351 --> 03:05:26.122
SAM: Sure, he can do whatever he wants. You can
also hit him over the head if you want.

03:05:26.122 --> 03:05:28.730
LIAM: Not until after this spell is done.

03:05:28.730 --> 03:05:32.920
ERIC: 13!

03:05:32.920 --> 03:05:40.935
LIAM: Aw, 13? Plus three is 16. He beat it! Damn!
He beat it! Spell burned!

03:05:40.935 --> 03:05:43.424
BRIAN: Now you know how I felt all night, Liam
Oberon.

03:05:43.424 --> 03:05:52.001
ERIC: You know, Jayne, I couldn't help but
overhear. You were talking down the hall, and

03:05:52.001 --> 03:06:00.755
these caverns echo. Did I not hear you say that
you may or may not be associated with the Chained

03:06:00.755 --> 03:06:02.166
Oblivion?

03:06:02.166 --> 03:06:05.163
LIAM: Was he anywhere near me when I had that
private conversation?

03:06:05.163 --> 03:06:13.533
SAM: The caverns do carry audio. Why don't you
roll a perception check? A retroactive perception

03:06:13.533 --> 03:06:15.863
check to see if you could hear that?

03:06:15.863 --> 03:06:18.676
ERIC: A straight roll.

03:06:18.676 --> 03:06:21.548
LIAM: Roll high. Catch me out, because I'm
terrible. That's a two.

03:06:21.548 --> 03:06:23.089
ERIC: Two! Fuck!

03:06:23.089 --> 03:06:27.270
SAM: You heard him say, "Jayne's a mailman."

03:06:27.270 --> 03:06:31.931
ERIC: Got to clean my ears.

03:06:31.931 --> 03:06:41.252
SAM: But something about Jayne has been bugging
you a lot. Me too, really. If we're going to be

03:06:41.252 --> 03:06:42.634
honest.

03:06:42.634 --> 03:06:45.581
ERIC: I've got my eye on you, Jayne.

03:06:45.581 --> 03:06:56.549
SAM: So is this where you guys are standing? Where
are you?

03:06:56.549 --> 03:06:58.864
MARY: Yep! That's where you put us.

03:06:58.864 --> 03:07:01.934
BRIAN: I might be leaning against something,
because I'm a little tipsy.

03:07:01.934 --> 03:07:03.728
MARY: I would like to move towards the door.

03:07:03.728 --> 03:07:05.572
BRIAN: Yeah, I'll go with her.

03:07:05.572 --> 03:07:08.347
ASHLY: So there is a door there?

03:07:08.347 --> 03:07:09.681
SAM: That's a door.

03:07:09.681 --> 03:07:11.516
BRIAN: Then there's a girl screaming on the other
side of that door.

03:07:11.516 --> 03:07:17.785
LIAM: Jayne places her hand on Clothesline's
shoulder and says: wait. No, I didn't leave that

03:07:17.785 --> 03:07:22.336
hallway. Whenever she would have walked forward I
would have said, wait.

03:07:22.336 --> 03:07:28.535
SAM: Oh, so she's back here? But she found an
object over there. So she's definitely there?

03:07:28.535 --> 03:07:30.114
LIAM: It's up to you if you wanted to.

03:07:30.114 --> 03:07:31.479
ASHLY: I will do what you say.

03:07:31.479 --> 03:07:33.800
SAM: You can tell her to go back or you can tell
her to wait there, but she's already there.

03:07:33.800 --> 03:07:34.865
LIAM: Come.

03:07:34.865 --> 03:07:36.304
SAM: Come where?

03:07:36.304 --> 03:07:39.837
LIAM: No, I'm at that tunnel entrance. I never
entered.

03:07:39.837 --> 03:07:42.269
SAM: Okay, got it. So you're calling her back?
Great. And Frankie?

03:07:42.269 --> 03:07:44.007
ERIC: I'm going to stay right there.

03:07:44.007 --> 03:07:53.917
SAM: Great. So you take four points of poison
damage as this pillar shoots out a bit of poison.

03:07:53.917 --> 03:07:56.711
You're standing near it, unfortunately.

03:07:56.711 --> 03:08:00.446
ERIC: Look, I just want to be close to the
action.

03:08:00.446 --> 03:08:05.434
SAM: Cool. You guys kind of get the sense that the
longer you stay in here the more shit's going to

03:08:05.434 --> 03:08:09.141
start happening. Anyone want to look at the door?

03:08:09.141 --> 03:08:10.768
MARY: I would like to look at the door.

03:08:10.768 --> 03:08:12.475
SAM: Okay, make an investigation check.

03:08:12.475 --> 03:08:22.338
MARY: Oh, Tides of Chaos. That's better. Not
really. 18. 16!

03:08:22.338 --> 03:08:31.492
SAM: Great. The door is not trapped. However, it
has a lock on it. A padlock. A curiously made

03:08:31.492 --> 03:08:34.381
padlock. Where is it?

03:08:34.381 --> 03:08:36.247
MARY: Are there numbers on the padlock?

03:08:36.247 --> 03:08:41.613
SAM: There are numbers on the padlock, and you can
definitely sense that the padlock is magically

03:08:41.613 --> 03:08:45.387
enchanted. And here it is!

03:08:45.387 --> 03:08:47.641
LIAM: Oh shit!

03:08:47.641 --> 03:08:49.802
MARY: What are the numbers on the padlock?

03:08:49.802 --> 03:08:52.913
SAM: Who wants to look where?

03:08:52.913 --> 03:08:54.547
LIAM: I'm looking at the ceiling.

03:08:54.547 --> 03:08:56.077
SAM: Okay, you're looking at the ceiling.

03:08:56.077 --> 03:08:57.886
LIAM: You said there are a lot of numbers up
there?

03:08:57.886 --> 03:09:02.772
SAM: Tons of numbers. 29, seven, 65, 44, ten,
nine, four--

03:09:02.772 --> 03:09:04.753
LIAM: And there's nothing different about any of
them?

03:09:04.753 --> 03:09:10.013
SAM: Yes there are. They are all in different
colors. Some are red, some are green, some are

03:09:10.013 --> 03:09:12.553
yellow, some are gold, some are orange.

03:09:12.553 --> 03:09:18.676
MARY: Can you see if there are numbers, like four
numbers on the ceiling that are the same color?

03:09:18.676 --> 03:09:20.142
LIAM: What color is the lock?

03:09:20.142 --> 03:09:28.209
SAM: The lock is a basic gray. However, the slot
where you line up the correct numbers has a faint

03:09:28.209 --> 03:09:34.706
color on it. The first two are orange. The second
two are green.

03:09:34.706 --> 03:09:40.717
MARY: Okay, so I'm looking at the padlock. Because
you're up at the ceiling and I'm at the door,

03:09:40.717 --> 03:09:45.336
right? Two orange, two green. What do you see up
top?

03:09:45.336 --> 03:09:46.899
LIAM: An Irish flag.

03:09:46.899 --> 03:09:52.268
MARY: All right. Which numbers are orange, which
numbers are green up on the ceiling?

03:09:52.268 --> 03:09:58.144
SAM: Can you make a perception check? It's really
grimy up there.

03:09:58.144 --> 03:10:03.061
LIAM: That is a 17 for me.

03:10:03.061 --> 03:10:12.495
SAM: You definitely get a bead on the orange
numbers. Grab your pencil. There's many orange

03:10:12.495 --> 03:10:22.442
numbers. They're all across the top of the
ceiling. They are six, one, eight, seven, two,

03:10:22.442 --> 03:10:33.881
one, eight, two, four, nine, two, seven, one,
zero.

03:10:33.881 --> 03:10:35.559
LIAM: You're a terrible person.

03:10:35.559 --> 03:10:37.438
ASHLY: Can I use this item about this?

03:10:37.438 --> 03:10:49.143
SAM: What is this item? Is it the earring? It can
tell you something about a person or a creature,

03:10:49.143 --> 03:10:51.107
but not about a room.

03:10:51.107 --> 03:10:52.498
ASHLY: Okay.

03:10:52.498 --> 03:10:55.842
LIAM: Were those the orange numbers?

03:10:55.842 --> 03:10:57.846
SAM: Those were the orange numbers.

03:10:57.846 --> 03:11:00.233
MARY: What are the green numbers?

03:11:00.233 --> 03:11:02.638
SAM: Make another perception check.

03:11:02.638 --> 03:11:07.313
LIAM: I got a 14.

03:11:07.313 --> 03:11:16.335
SAM: You can make out many of them. You get the
sense that if you got closer, somehow, you could

03:11:16.335 --> 03:11:17.486
see more.

03:11:17.486 --> 03:11:19.105
LIAM: How's the bard doing?

03:11:19.105 --> 03:11:20.248
SAM: The bard?

03:11:20.248 --> 03:11:21.139
LIAM: The bard!

03:11:21.139 --> 03:11:22.540
SAM: I don't know how he's doing.

03:11:22.540 --> 03:11:26.929
LIAM: I see him staring up, as well. How are you
doing, darling?

03:11:26.929 --> 03:11:34.655
BRIAN: Fine. I'm wondering the endgame. I might go
back upstairs. But I want to see--

03:11:34.655 --> 03:11:38.498
LIAM: Can you read the numbers on the ceiling?

03:11:38.498 --> 03:11:45.686
BRIAN: Yeah, let me try. Oh wait, I did. Oh,
perception. I did investigation.

03:11:45.686 --> 03:11:48.168
ASHLY: I rolled a 16 for perception.

03:11:48.168 --> 03:11:55.391
SAM: Okay, so fine. While Kingston is fiddling
with his wingle--

03:11:55.391 --> 03:11:56.757
BRIAN: 20.

03:11:56.757 --> 03:12:03.450
SAM: 20?! You both see the green numbers very
clearly through the grime, dust, and cobwebs are

03:12:03.450 --> 03:12:14.836
one, five, four, nine, eight, one, four, one,
three, two, zero.

03:12:14.836 --> 03:12:16.286
LIAM: Keep going.

03:12:16.286 --> 03:12:18.106
SAM: Now, I wait.

03:12:18.106 --> 03:12:21.025
(laughter)

03:12:21.025 --> 03:12:25.052
MARY: There are three less green numbers than
there are orange, and we've got two and two on the

03:12:25.052 --> 03:12:34.425
padlock, two orange and two green. First two
numbers add to six and six. Motherfucker. I was

03:12:34.425 --> 03:12:35.944
promised no math.

03:12:35.944 --> 03:12:37.938
BRIAN: Promised no math.

03:12:37.938 --> 03:12:44.675
ASHLY: There's four pillars in the room, but I
assume it's not relevant.

03:12:44.675 --> 03:12:50.864
MARY: There's only three, right? Is the one pillar
still standing, or did it explode after hitting us?

03:12:50.864 --> 03:12:52.710
LIAM: There's four pillars. One of them poofed out
poison.

03:12:52.710 --> 03:12:54.821
ERIC: It was rough.

03:12:54.821 --> 03:13:07.875
SAM: Sorry, guys. On the other side of the door,
you hear a low (snarling).

03:13:07.875 --> 03:13:10.483
MARY: Oh, fuck. All right.

03:13:10.483 --> 03:13:12.526
BRIAN: Did that sound like a cat to anyone else?

03:13:12.526 --> 03:13:15.566
MARY: No, that sounded like a lizard or
something.

03:13:15.566 --> 03:13:21.384
LIAM: And the lock looks like what over there?

03:13:21.384 --> 03:13:23.129
MARY: It's like a big padlock.

03:13:23.129 --> 03:13:28.872
BRIAN: Is there anything I can see on the lock?
Tell me about the lock.

03:13:28.872 --> 03:13:30.750
SAM: Sure. Make an investigation check.

03:13:30.750 --> 03:13:37.636
BRIAN: 18.

03:13:37.636 --> 03:13:50.190
SAM: 18. That's great, yeah. It is specifically
designed in a way that-- it's a fragile thing. I

03:13:50.190 --> 03:13:58.267
wouldn't try to hit it, because it has a trigger
mechanism that could fire something if struck.

03:13:58.267 --> 03:14:00.328
It's got a pressure pad on it.

03:14:00.328 --> 03:14:02.663
ASHLY: That's what I was going to do.

03:14:02.663 --> 03:14:08.627
MARY: Can we see any of the numbers on the walls?
Is there anything else on the walls?

03:14:08.627 --> 03:14:11.842
SAM: No numbers on the walls.

03:14:11.842 --> 03:14:13.738
MARY: There's nothing on the floor.

03:14:13.738 --> 03:14:15.757
ASHLY: How many snakes are on the pillars?

03:14:15.757 --> 03:14:21.189
SAM: Let me do the math.

03:14:21.189 --> 03:14:27.857
BRIAN: There's no numbers on the pillars, correct?
Just symbols?

03:14:27.857 --> 03:14:30.895
LIAM: Sam's given us a MENSA challenge, and we all
die here.

03:14:30.895 --> 03:14:39.646
MARY: We come back four years later. All right, so
the numbers again? Six, one, eight--

03:14:39.646 --> 03:14:42.047
LIAM: Seven months without an episode break.

03:14:42.047 --> 03:14:51.005
SAM: On one pillar, there's one snake. On the
next, there's three. On the next, there's two. On

03:14:51.005 --> 03:14:52.695
the next, there's six.

03:14:52.695 --> 03:14:54.459
ERIC: Say that again.

03:14:54.459 --> 03:14:56.878
SAM: One, three, two, six.

03:14:56.878 --> 03:15:00.389
BRIAN: That's on the pillars? Both, or all four?

03:15:00.389 --> 03:15:03.990
SAM: This one has one, this one has three, this
one has two, this one has six.

03:15:03.990 --> 03:15:13.818
BRIAN: Does the padlock have four numbers to open
it?

03:15:13.818 --> 03:15:17.592
SAM: Four numbers. Two orange, two green.

03:15:17.592 --> 03:15:20.925
BRIAN: How do we try them?

03:15:20.925 --> 03:15:24.511
LIAM: The numbers on the pillars are not any
color, are they?

03:15:24.511 --> 03:15:25.881
SAM: No.

03:15:25.881 --> 03:15:28.837
ASHLY: I wonder if there's a penalty for trying
them. You could try it on this if you want to.

03:15:28.837 --> 03:15:35.487
BRIAN: Could I try it on this? Okay. I'm just
going to fucking just because I know this fucker.

03:15:35.487 --> 03:15:40.787
This is very hard to turn. It needs some WD-40,
Sam.

03:15:40.787 --> 03:15:41.988
SAM: Sorry.

03:15:41.988 --> 03:15:43.283
BRIAN: It's okay.

03:15:43.283 --> 03:15:53.696
LIAM: You're so brave, Kingston. You should try as
many combinations as possible. Even if it burns

03:15:53.696 --> 03:15:56.877
you somehow, you should keep trying.

03:15:56.877 --> 03:15:59.654
BRIAN: Is it top to bottom or bottom to top to
open this?

03:15:59.654 --> 03:16:01.128
SAM: Top to bottom.

03:16:01.128 --> 03:16:05.572
BRIAN: Shit. Fuck. Someone do something else while
I do this.

03:16:05.572 --> 03:16:14.660
ASHLY: While he's doing that, Sam, I'm going to
use this Earring of Piercing Knowledge and try to

03:16:14.660 --> 03:16:17.350
find out if there are any weaknesses that Jayne
has.

03:16:17.350 --> 03:16:24.880
SAM: She gets to know one fact about you. What she
has just used is a magical-- what is it called?

03:16:24.880 --> 03:16:26.913
ASHLY: Earring of Piercing Knowledge.

03:16:26.913 --> 03:16:31.817
SAM: You have to pierce your ear with it. Little
trickle of blood comes down, and now she knows one

03:16:31.817 --> 03:16:35.122
fact about you, and she's chosen to know your
weaknesses.

03:16:35.122 --> 03:16:39.918
LIAM: My weaknesses? I don't know what those are.
I could tell her many things.

03:16:39.918 --> 03:16:44.373
SAM: Well, how about your-- let's see here.

03:16:44.373 --> 03:16:50.679
LIAM: I will tell you lots of things in the
interest of not slowing down this episode. You

03:16:50.679 --> 03:17:00.888
learn that I'm very weak and easily hit. You learn
that I am almost out of spells. And you have

03:17:00.888 --> 03:17:08.827
learned that I am part of four generations of
women that have served the Chained Oblivion, which

03:17:08.827 --> 03:17:15.337
is a god that everyone has heard of. And the
Chained Oblivion wants to destroy everything and I

03:17:15.337 --> 03:17:21.313
am &lt;i&gt;fucking&lt;/i&gt; crazy, just like my mother.

03:17:21.313 --> 03:17:27.741
SAM: Make a perception check. Or investigation
check, whatever's higher.

03:17:27.741 --> 03:17:32.900
MARY: Investigation. 14.

03:17:32.900 --> 03:17:38.875
SAM: Upon looking at the numbers up top,
especially the orange ones, you start to realize

03:17:38.875 --> 03:18:02.314
there's spaces between them. It's six, 18, seven,
21, eight, 24, nine, 27, ten. There are spaces in

03:18:02.314 --> 03:18:04.708
between.

03:18:04.708 --> 03:18:10.289
MARY: Those are the orange numbers.

03:18:10.289 --> 03:18:12.662
SAM: Come on, guys, it's basic arithmetic.

03:18:12.662 --> 03:18:18.717
ASHLY: We all had a little bit of Greep. I can't
even remember what it's called now.

03:18:18.717 --> 03:18:20.517
MARY and ASHLY: Greep.

03:18:20.517 --> 03:18:24.059
LIAM: What's after the eight? 24?

03:18:24.059 --> 03:18:25.091
SAM: 24.

03:18:25.091 --> 03:18:28.012
LIAM: Nine. The fuck is this, Sam?

03:18:28.012 --> 03:18:29.681
ASHLY: I'm sure the chat's like, "It's this! It's
this!"

03:18:29.681 --> 03:18:31.467
SAM: Oh, they are absolutely.

03:18:31.467 --> 03:18:36.982
MARY: The chat's going, "Why can't you figure it
out?!"

03:18:36.982 --> 03:18:40.692
BRIAN: Are we in any imminent danger?

03:18:40.692 --> 03:18:51.377
SAM: As you say that, one of the pillars explodes.
These guys, Mary and Brian, you each take five

03:18:51.377 --> 03:18:53.880
points of poison damage.

03:18:53.880 --> 03:18:57.027
LIAM: I see a pattern, but I don't know what it
leads to.

03:18:57.027 --> 03:18:59.558
ASHLY: 24, nine.

03:18:59.558 --> 03:19:03.756
LIAM: Assholes.

03:19:03.756 --> 03:19:05.676
ASHLY: What?

03:19:05.676 --> 03:19:11.401
LIAM: Six is one-third of 18. Seven is one-third
of 21. Eight is one-third of 24. Nine is one-third

03:19:11.401 --> 03:19:20.557
of 27. Ten. What's the ten? Ten is different than
the rest. I don't know if that means ten is

03:19:20.557 --> 03:19:28.167
important, but it's different than the rest. Ten.

03:19:28.167 --> 03:19:29.776
SAM: Say that all again, Liam?

03:19:29.776 --> 03:19:36.805
LIAM: Six is one-third of 18. Seven is one-third
of 21. Eight is one-third of 24. Nine is one-third

03:19:36.805 --> 03:19:40.444
of 27. Ten is one-third of-- there's nothing
there.

03:19:40.444 --> 03:19:41.903
BRIAN: What is ten one-third of?

03:19:41.903 --> 03:19:43.201
LIAM: 30.

03:19:43.201 --> 03:19:48.454
BRIAN: So try-- well, there's four numbers,
though.

03:19:48.454 --> 03:19:55.374
SAM: Those numbers that you're looking at are
orange. The first two slots on the lock are

03:19:55.374 --> 03:19:56.512
orange.

03:19:56.512 --> 03:19:58.850
BRIAN: So we need to find the two numbers that are
green now.

03:19:58.850 --> 03:20:03.172
SAM: Make a perception check.

03:20:03.172 --> 03:20:05.217
BRIAN: (groans) This isn't going well for me.

03:20:05.217 --> 03:20:08.395
MARY: That's a five.

03:20:08.395 --> 03:20:11.933
BRAIN: Perception? 18.

03:20:11.933 --> 03:20:14.765
SAM: There are also spaces between these numbers.

03:20:14.765 --> 03:20:16.643
BRIAN: Nope. 13. Your writing's too small.

03:20:16.643 --> 03:20:18.012
SAM: One.

03:20:18.012 --> 03:20:20.573
BRIAN: Is that an eight or a three?

03:20:20.573 --> 03:20:23.111
LIAM: Why did you have to bring math into it, you
shit?

03:20:23.111 --> 03:20:25.521
SAM: Yeah, I know, right? Four. I can't really
write upside down.

03:20:25.521 --> 03:20:27.614
LIAM: You're doing it.

03:20:27.614 --> 03:20:29.910
MARY and SAM: Nine. Eight.

03:20:29.910 --> 03:20:31.488
MARY: 14.

03:20:31.488 --> 03:20:34.001
SAM: Correct. 14.

03:20:34.001 --> 03:20:36.234
MARY and SAM: 13, 20.

03:20:36.234 --> 03:20:41.726
LIAM: Shit, what is that?

03:20:41.726 --> 03:20:52.142
BRIAN: Well, there's even and odd numbers mixed up
in there.

03:20:52.142 --> 03:21:07.182
MARY: One plus four is five. Four plus five is
nine. Eight plus six is 14? 13 plus seven is 20.

03:21:07.182 --> 03:21:21.291
That's all I know. That's all the math I got. So
you got four, five, six, seven-- in a row. I don't

03:21:21.291 --> 03:21:23.133
know what that is, Liam.

03:21:23.133 --> 03:21:25.348
ASHLY: This is not my forte. I'm just pulling
shit--

03:21:25.348 --> 03:21:34.219
MARY: So one plus four is five. Four plus five is
nine. Eight plus six is 14 and three plus seven is

03:21:34.219 --> 03:21:36.871
20. I don't know what that means.

03:21:36.871 --> 03:21:38.292
SAM: So what's next?

03:21:38.292 --> 03:21:40.429
MARY and ASHLY: Oh!

03:21:40.429 --> 03:21:46.062
LIAM: There are so many math majors watching right
now who are so mad at us.

03:21:46.062 --> 03:21:50.944
MARY: Why are you so stupid, Rose? You're so
stupid.

03:21:50.944 --> 03:21:53.652
LIAM: But Eric can sound like Chris Rock so--

03:21:53.652 --> 03:21:55.511
SAM: Let's hear it, Eric.

03:21:55.511 --> 03:22:01.334
ERIC: What's the deal with math? It wasn't a math
quiz show.

03:22:01.334 --> 03:22:07.031
BRIAN: So 30. the first two numbers were the
last--

03:22:07.031 --> 03:22:12.664
MARY: 14, 30! 20-- Wait. Okay, so you subtract one
from five, you get four. Subtract one from nine,

03:22:12.664 --> 03:22:17.170
you get eight. Subtract one from 13, you get 20.
Subtract--

03:22:17.170 --> 03:22:24.449
BRIAN: 19! So 3-0-1-9 or 1-9-3-0? Would be the two
options.

03:22:24.449 --> 03:22:26.668
SAM: What you got, Mary?

03:22:26.668 --> 03:22:29.698
MARY: 30 was the first and 19 was the second, but
that ain't right.

03:22:29.698 --> 03:22:33.967
SAM: Look at the slot. Look at the slot on the
side. That's where the numbers go.

03:22:33.967 --> 03:22:37.289
(laughter)

03:22:37.289 --> 03:22:39.537
MARY: 30 and 19.

03:22:39.537 --> 03:22:43.817
BRIAN: Or 1-9-3-0.

03:22:43.817 --> 03:22:53.927
SAM: The lock is broken. The door is open; you are
in. This doesn't work!

03:22:53.927 --> 03:22:55.934
BRIAN: You used Sharpie!

03:22:55.934 --> 03:23:02.754
LIAM: Can we get a wet rag flown in? You are
getting beat up behind the studio tonight.

03:23:02.754 --> 03:23:06.700
SAM: I love it. I'll do it over here; it's fine.

03:23:06.700 --> 03:23:09.980
MARY: Does that work? Oh yeah. We just need a wet
rag. We need a wet rag, it's all good.

03:23:09.980 --> 03:23:11.075
BRIAN: I got it!

03:23:11.075 --> 03:23:18.370
MARY: You got it. You have no idea how difficult
math was. Math! No math, ever. Sam, you have a

03:23:18.370 --> 03:23:24.585
brain for it. We don't. We've been drinking since
Tuesday.

03:23:24.585 --> 03:23:28.374
SAM: Okay. Who's going in?

03:23:28.374 --> 03:23:35.595
MARY: I am. Because I was right there by the
fucking door and in a celebratory moment of

03:23:35.595 --> 03:23:39.735
getting the padlock open, I fall to my death.

03:23:39.735 --> 03:23:42.565
SAM: Who's going in?

03:23:42.565 --> 03:23:43.542
MARY: I'm going in.

03:23:43.542 --> 03:23:48.634
SAM: You're going in. Where'd you go? Oh, over
here. Okay. Just you, right?

03:23:48.634 --> 03:23:51.243
MARY: Well, Brian might go too because he was
right next to me.

03:23:51.243 --> 03:23:54.545
LIAM: I mean, his character's dumb as fuck. I
think he might be going in.

03:23:54.545 --> 03:23:57.816
MARY: Okay. Kingston LaForge!

03:23:57.816 --> 03:24:04.408
SAM: Mary, this is what you see. The room is
similar in size and shape to the anteroom with a

03:24:04.408 --> 03:24:09.374
coved ceiling held up by four spectacular carved
pillars. Two side pathways go to the right and

03:24:09.374 --> 03:24:12.565
left of the room. I didn't remember that part, but
whatever.

03:24:12.565 --> 03:24:23.896
On the far side of the room is a circular portal
glowing gold and emanating a low hum and even

03:24:23.896 --> 03:24:30.570
though you are far from the warmth of the tavern
this room throbs with heat, as if you were walking

03:24:30.570 --> 03:24:37.690
through a recently used oven. At the foot of the
portal, you see that man. Jesus, I lost him.

03:24:37.690 --> 03:24:39.776
MARY: Where's that man?

03:24:39.776 --> 03:24:50.327
SAM: I lost him. There he is. Boom. Holding a
struggling child. She screams in pain. There are

03:24:50.327 --> 03:24:57.595
scratch marks above her eye and a steady trickle
of blood is pouring down half her face. The man

03:24:57.595 --> 03:25:05.695
sees you enter and says, "It seems we all want
this youngling. I'm sorry, surface creatures, I

03:25:05.695 --> 03:25:13.618
"saw her first. She's needed below." And you notice
that behind him a large, glowing portal opens up,

03:25:13.618 --> 03:25:20.687
iris is open ever so slightly. It's pulsing, it's not
open enough for a person to walk in, but it's

03:25:20.687 --> 03:25:23.074
getting close. What would you like to do?

03:25:23.074 --> 03:25:31.630
MARY: I wanted to do a bonus action. I want to use
a couple of sorcery points to get another

03:25:31.630 --> 03:25:42.863
1st-level spell because I lost one because of my
wild magic. Hello, everybody, there seems to be

03:25:42.863 --> 03:25:50.137
our girl with the guy who's awful and he's-- come
here now! We need to help because otherwise he

03:25:50.137 --> 03:25:52.320
will leave. There's a portal that's opening!

03:25:52.320 --> 03:26:04.218
SAM: The man dashes to you. He gets right there
and he attacks. He rolled a one. He misses, but he

03:26:04.218 --> 03:26:11.739
gets another attack. That's a 20. That hits.

03:26:11.739 --> 03:26:13.170
MARY: Yeah.

03:26:13.170 --> 03:26:21.741
SAM: Let me roll. Ooh. It's going to be bad.

03:26:21.741 --> 03:26:30.715
ASHLY: He's still rolling!

03:26:30.715 --> 03:26:33.910
SAM: Roll a dexterity saving throw.

03:26:33.910 --> 03:26:42.087
MARY: I have good dexterity. 20.

03:26:42.087 --> 03:26:49.164
SAM: Great. As he attacks, his human form drops
away and you see a salamander standing before you.

03:26:49.164 --> 03:26:58.165
He's a large, ferocious lizard creature with a body of red
and orange scales, hard to see clearly because the

03:26:58.165 --> 03:27:02.910
intense heat they throw off blurs the air around
them. His head and neck are more humanoid, with

03:27:02.910 --> 03:27:07.865
smoke seeping out of his eyes and ears. He has a
streak of black that runs from one eye all the way

03:27:07.865 --> 03:27:13.654
up and over his scalp. He's so hot, it's as if
he's made of fire. He holds a long black iron

03:27:13.654 --> 03:27:23.210
spear in one claw and a ten-foot-long tail snaps behind
him. His slimy black tongue darts out, testing the

03:27:23.210 --> 03:27:29.128
air, smelling you. You have just been dealt 15
points of fire damage.

03:27:29.128 --> 03:27:32.373
MARY: Fire's my element. Does that mean it's
halved?

03:27:32.373 --> 03:27:36.379
SAM: I don't know, man. You know you. Are you
resistant to fire?

03:27:36.379 --> 03:27:37.724
MARY: I'm resistant to fire.

03:27:37.724 --> 03:27:48.785
SAM: Then you only take seven points of fire
damage. You are not grappled. It is your turn, Mary.

03:27:48.785 --> 03:27:53.586
MARY: The Ray of Frost seemed to work so well.

03:27:53.586 --> 03:27:55.781
BRIAN: Did we roll initiative?

03:27:55.781 --> 03:27:57.731
SAM: You're not in the fucking room.

03:27:57.731 --> 03:27:59.016
MARY: It's just me and him.

03:27:59.016 --> 03:28:01.840
BRIAN: Oh! I see. Sorry, I was getting you your Wet
Nap.

03:28:01.840 --> 03:28:04.817
SAM: You guys are letting Mary take it.

03:28:04.817 --> 03:28:11.168
MARY: It seems to be, Mr. Salamander, that you are
fire, fire, fire, so I'm going to come at you with

03:28:11.168 --> 03:28:24.136
frost, frost, frost which is the only thing I
bloody have. Oh, wait. I'm going to use Chromatic

03:28:24.136 --> 03:28:30.687
Orb of cold against salamander.

03:28:30.687 --> 03:28:34.636
SAM: Go to that table.

03:28:34.636 --> 03:28:41.884
MARY: I'm going to roll on the fucking table. (New
Jersey accent) Boom! All right, so I did just get

03:28:41.884 --> 03:28:47.042
back from the Clam Broth House. They had some
beautiful trout. They had some beautiful fucking

03:28:47.042 --> 03:28:51.654
trout that day. You know what I'm saying? They had
trout. It was gorgeous. It was beautiful.

03:28:51.654 --> 03:28:53.954
LIAM: (New Jersey accent) You know what you got to
do? You got to fucking attack.

03:28:53.954 --> 03:28:57.657
MARY: (New Jersey accent) Oh my god. What is that?
I think that's a fucking nine.

03:28:57.657 --> 03:29:00.528
SAM: Nine. Oh shit.

03:29:00.528 --> 03:29:03.128
LIAM: (New Jersey accent) I would like to use my
bonus action to drop a deuce.

03:29:03.128 --> 03:29:07.470
MARY: (New Jersey accent) Isn't this beautiful?
Hey, motherfucking salamander! How you fucking

03:29:07.470 --> 03:29:13.459
doing? You good today? You good? Your tongue
smells like shit, like a bad pastrami that I had

03:29:13.459 --> 03:29:19.991
once back at the Millburn Deli. What I'm going to
tell you right now. I rolled a fucking nine.

03:29:19.991 --> 03:29:23.177
You, 60 feet, are going to become poisoned.

03:29:23.177 --> 03:29:29.833
SAM: Yeah. He is poisoned now. I really don't know
how poison works, but I assume

03:29:29.833 --> 03:29:31.604
he takes poison damage.

03:29:31.604 --> 03:29:34.183
LIAM: Disadvantage on his shit. I love high
fantasy, by the way.

03:29:34.183 --> 03:29:39.381
MARY: (New Jersey accent) Millburn Deli, you're
going to like a sloppy joe. What you want to do is

03:29:39.424 --> 03:29:44.099
get it with a little extra mayo, you got to go
extra sloppy with this shit. It'll counteract the

03:29:44.099 --> 03:29:48.596
poison. Too bad we're not there right now. You're
going to fucking be poisoned. How you doing?

03:29:48.596 --> 03:29:50.932
Boom, bitches!

03:29:50.932 --> 03:29:55.708
SAM: He does not like that very much. He also
doesn't like the accent. He thinks it's uncouth.

03:29:55.708 --> 03:30:03.358
I'm looking for poison. Bear with me. Okay,
poisoned creature has disadvantages on attack

03:30:03.358 --> 03:30:06.984
rolls and ability checks. Holy shit! That's
amazing!

03:30:06.984 --> 03:30:08.586
MARY: And he's poisoned for--

03:30:08.586 --> 03:30:14.811
SAM: Well, it'll be more than an hour, so it's fine.
That's great. Well, he's about to attack you again--

03:30:14.811 --> 03:30:16.794
MARY: For four hours, he's poisoned.

03:30:16.794 --> 03:30:19.300
SAM: Great. Anyone else doing anything?

03:30:19.300 --> 03:30:20.910
BRIAN: I would like to come into the room.

03:30:20.910 --> 03:30:26.782
LIAM: I start pushing the cat, and start moving
towards the room.

03:30:26.782 --> 03:30:30.210
MARY: Push the cat towards the room.

03:30:30.210 --> 03:30:32.976
ASHLY: Oh great, it's a salamander now. Awesome.
Perfect.

03:30:32.976 --> 03:30:37.678
LIAM: And I would like to try to get within ten
feet of the salamander, so behind the sorcerer.

03:30:37.678 --> 03:30:41.186
SAM: All right, I'll say they flank them. You're
behind the sorcerer.

03:30:41.186 --> 03:30:45.149
LIAM: And I would like to attack, if no one else
is going to jump on it.

03:30:45.149 --> 03:30:49.255
SAM: Well, roll for initiative. Let's get an
initiative order.

03:30:49.255 --> 03:30:51.193
LIAM: Yeah.

03:30:51.193 --> 03:30:56.521
ASHLY: Eight.

03:30:56.521 --> 03:31:00.853
SAM: Okay, 20 to 25?

03:31:00.853 --> 03:31:03.288
MARY: Do you add anything to initiative?

03:31:03.288 --> 03:31:08.199
SAM: Yes, it'll say on your character sheet.
You're plus three to initiative.

03:31:08.199 --> 03:31:10.399
MARY: I am? 19.

03:31:10.399 --> 03:31:13.400
SAM: Okay. Gryf.

03:31:13.400 --> 03:31:15.558
LIAM: 17.

03:31:15.558 --> 03:31:22.608
SAM: 17 Jayne, who else, 15 to 20? Anyone 15 to
20? Ten to 15?

03:31:22.608 --> 03:31:24.085
BRIAN: 11.

03:31:24.085 --> 03:31:25.652
SAM: Who else?

03:31:25.652 --> 03:31:27.043
ERIC: Seven.

03:31:27.043 --> 03:31:28.688
ASHLY: I'm an eight.

03:31:28.688 --> 03:31:30.711
ERIC: Didn't roll high that time.

03:31:30.711 --> 03:31:32.874
SAM: Frank is eight? No--

03:31:32.874 --> 03:31:33.956
ASHLY: I'm eight.

03:31:33.956 --> 03:31:43.464
SAM: Clothesline's eight. Frank's seven. Okay.
Salamander gets to go first. I don't know how to

03:31:43.464 --> 03:31:45.029
do this for him.

03:31:45.029 --> 03:31:47.866
MARY: It's okay. Just wing it, it's the secret to
adulthood.

03:31:47.866 --> 03:31:49.818
LIAM: None of it's real.

03:31:49.818 --> 03:31:58.364
SAM: All right, he's going to use his spear to
attack the bard to his right. That is a big old

03:31:58.364 --> 03:31:59.456
22.

03:31:59.456 --> 03:32:01.183
BRIAN: That hits.

03:32:01.183 --> 03:32:03.031
SAM: Yeah, sorry, friend.

03:32:03.031 --> 03:32:24.377
15 damage. You get pierced by this super
sharp spear, and it hurts real bad. And also, when

03:32:24.377 --> 03:32:29.922
he withdraws it from your body, you suffer another
two points of fire damage, because it's

03:32:29.922 --> 03:32:39.607
super-heated; it's almost molten iron, it's so
fucking hot. 15 plus two, and he gets to attack

03:32:39.607 --> 03:32:48.293
again. He's going to go to the cat. Ooh, that's a
19 plus a lot. With his tail, he whips it around--

03:32:48.293 --> 03:32:52.038
ASHLY: This might be the end of Clothesline.

03:32:52.038 --> 03:32:56.126
SAM: That is a ten.

03:32:56.126 --> 03:32:59.251
ASHLY: That is how many hit points I have.

03:32:59.251 --> 03:33:00.916
SAM: You are unconscious.

03:33:00.916 --> 03:33:02.134
ASHLY: See ya!

03:33:02.134 --> 03:33:05.010
SAM: I don't know how all that works, but you're
unconscious.

03:33:05.010 --> 03:33:08.791
LIAM: On her next turn, she makes a death saving
throw. So she's just unconscious. She could be

03:33:08.791 --> 03:33:12.359
brought back, if anybody gives a fuck.

03:33:12.359 --> 03:33:20.065
SAM: And on its movement, it will leave. You get
an attack of opportunity on it, both of you.

03:33:20.065 --> 03:33:21.969
LIAM: Oh, it's running?

03:33:21.969 --> 03:33:23.886
SAM: Yes, it's going (hisses).

03:33:23.886 --> 03:33:27.881
LIAM: It's within ten feet of my range with the
whip, so I do, too.

03:33:27.881 --> 03:33:33.407
SAM: All right, so make three attacks against this
thing. Kingston, you go first.

03:33:33.407 --> 03:33:35.570
BRIAN: I would like to--

03:33:35.570 --> 03:33:42.166
SAM: Are you a lore bard? I think you are. I think
you get to cast a spell on retreat.

03:33:42.166 --> 03:33:46.331
BRIAN: I am, man. I will cast a--

03:33:46.331 --> 03:33:48.413
SAM: If you want. Or you can use a fucking sword
or whatever.

03:33:48.413 --> 03:33:52.325
BRIAN: I am going to have to cast Thunderwave at
this bitch.

03:33:52.325 --> 03:33:57.921
SAM: Okay, go ahead. That is just a spell, right?
It's not ranged.

03:33:57.921 --> 03:34:01.760
BRIAN: On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8
thunder damage.

03:34:01.760 --> 03:34:03.329
SAM: Sure, what is the save?

03:34:03.329 --> 03:34:05.658
BRIAN: The save is going to be a 14.

03:34:05.658 --> 03:34:13.679
SAM: 14. Oh, he makes the save, but he takes half
damage, so instead of 2d8 it's 1d8?

03:34:13.679 --> 03:34:14.978
BRIAN: Sure, man.

03:34:14.978 --> 03:34:16.805
MARY: He's still poisoned. What does that mean?

03:34:16.805 --> 03:34:18.338
LIAM: Disadvantage on everything.

03:34:18.338 --> 03:34:22.372
SAM: Oh shit! I didn't roll disadvantage on those
attacks!

03:34:22.372 --> 03:34:26.754
ASHLY: It's all right. I'm taking a cat nap; it's
fine.

03:34:26.754 --> 03:34:30.304
BRIAN: That's not going to work. That's an eight.

03:34:30.304 --> 03:34:33.854
SAM: Great. Actually, roll 2d8, and then take half
of that.

03:34:33.854 --> 03:34:36.707
BRIAN: Okay. That's also an eight.

03:34:36.707 --> 03:34:42.056
SAM: Great, so it's eight. Did he make his save?
He made his save, so he's not knocked prone, but

03:34:42.056 --> 03:34:49.300
he does take eight points of damage. Good job,
guys! That's thunder damage, yeah? Okay. Great.

03:34:49.300 --> 03:34:53.858
BRIAN: As a bonus action, can I cast a spell?

03:34:53.858 --> 03:34:58.318
SAM: No. You get that on retreat. Mary, it's your
turn.

03:34:58.318 --> 03:35:03.451
MARY: I get an attack, yeah? So I'm going to cast
a 1st-level Chromatic Orb.

03:35:03.451 --> 03:35:07.824
SAM: You don't get to cast spells, I believe. You
can only do a melee hit if someone is running away

03:35:07.824 --> 03:35:08.747
from you.

03:35:08.747 --> 03:35:21.077
MARY: All right, then I'm going to pull out my
shortbow, and I'm going to (bowstring pings).

03:35:21.077 --> 03:35:23.864
SAM: All right, roll an attack, plus whatever.

03:35:23.864 --> 03:35:30.711
MARY: That was terrible. Just a straight attack?

03:35:30.711 --> 03:35:37.435
SAM: Nope, it's d20 plus-- what is it? Is this a
finesse weapon? I don't know how bows work. Here,

03:35:37.435 --> 03:35:39.112
it says plus three. Plus three.

03:35:39.112 --> 03:35:41.642
MARY: Oh, plus three. Eight.

03:35:41.642 --> 03:35:50.143
SAM: That goes wide, and it almost hits the girl.
Whip master? What've you got?

03:35:50.143 --> 03:35:56.516
LIAM: With how things are going, and where I am
right now, I'm just going to cast Chill Touch,

03:35:56.516 --> 03:35:58.659
which has a range of 120 feet.

03:35:58.659 --> 03:36:00.758
SAM: Can you cast a spell on retreat?

03:36:00.758 --> 03:36:01.831
LIAM: Retreat?

03:36:01.831 --> 03:36:04.299
SAM: He's moving away from you; it's not your
turn.

03:36:04.299 --> 03:36:05.815
LIAM: Oh, it's not my turn?

03:36:05.815 --> 03:36:07.807
SAM: No, this is your attack of opportunity.

03:36:07.807 --> 03:36:14.145
LIAM: Oh, if he ran, no, that would be the whip,
as soon as he ran. So that's just an attack. That

03:36:14.145 --> 03:36:24.874
hits. That's an 18 plus some stuff. Okay, so
that's just 1d4 plus two, so that is a two plus

03:36:24.874 --> 03:36:35.339
two is four, and I'm going to Channel Divinity and
fill that with death. So that will be a total of

03:36:35.339 --> 03:36:40.469
more than four. One second, please.

03:36:40.469 --> 03:36:41.771
SAM: Less than three?

03:36:41.771 --> 03:36:49.765
LIAM: Hold on. That's an 18 damage, as it runs. 18
total, as it runs. It was a four from the whip,

03:36:49.765 --> 03:36:59.910
and then 14 necrotic damage because I'm fucking
insane. And the Chained Oblivion's wrath fills

03:36:59.910 --> 03:37:02.079
this fucking asshole.

03:37:02.079 --> 03:37:08.986
SAM: Ooh, nice. He does not like that. It is now
Gryffin's turn; that was just his turn in retreat.

03:37:08.986 --> 03:37:14.886
MARY: All right, I'm going to then cast Chromatic
Orb. Cold.

03:37:14.886 --> 03:37:18.336
SAM: Okay, he's hiding behind a pillar; he has
half cover.

03:37:18.336 --> 03:37:19.999
LIAM: Half cover, so at disadvantage.

03:37:19.999 --> 03:37:21.202
MARY: Half cover.

03:37:21.202 --> 03:37:23.935
SAM: You can move to see him.

03:37:23.935 --> 03:37:26.720
LIAM: So you can go on a diagonal, and then you
can see him straight on.

03:37:26.720 --> 03:37:37.178
MARY: I'm going to go on a diagonal. Diagon Alley.
And I am going to cast Chromatic Orb, with cold.

03:37:37.178 --> 03:37:42.431
SAM: All right, spell DC? Right? Or is it a
ranged?

03:37:42.431 --> 03:37:44.437
MARY: It's a hurl. I've got to hurl.

03:37:44.437 --> 03:37:48.368
SAM: Ranged attack. Okay, so roll a d20 add six?

03:37:48.368 --> 03:37:51.587
MARY: 24?

03:37:51.587 --> 03:37:56.293
SAM: Yep, that hits, for sure. So now roll 3d8.

03:37:56.293 --> 03:38:04.517
MARY: Right. 3d8, because I cast it at 1st-level.
What are d8s? Oh my god. I got you, bro. One, two,

03:38:04.517 --> 03:38:10.180
I'll just-- Five and four is nine, plus seven--
16.

03:38:10.180 --> 03:38:20.929
SAM: 16 points of damage, doubled to 32, is a big
hit. Great.

03:38:20.929 --> 03:38:28.012
MARY: Feel the chill, motherfucker! Oh, another
salamander's coming.

03:38:28.012 --> 03:38:29.658
SAM: Just then--

03:38:29.658 --> 03:38:34.250
LIAM: Elizabeth Warren runs in!

03:38:34.250 --> 03:38:35.804
MARY: What?!

03:38:35.804 --> 03:38:46.815
SAM: I don't have her. Fuck it. Just then, an old
lady runs in the room. She has a hoof print on her

03:38:46.815 --> 03:38:55.243
face. She's bloody, she is pissed off, her arm is
broken, she runs in and says, "Where's the bitch

03:38:55.243 --> 03:39:03.170
"that ran me over with a horse?" Great. Jayne, it's
your turn.

03:39:03.170 --> 03:39:06.772
(laughter)

03:39:06.772 --> 03:39:10.660
LIAM: Well, it wasn't me. Shit.

03:39:10.660 --> 03:39:13.306
MARY: So he's not bloodied, he's not nothing?

03:39:13.306 --> 03:39:19.627
SAM: Oh, he's looking rough. Oh yeah, salamander
is looking rough.

03:39:19.627 --> 03:39:29.937
LIAM: As a cantrip, I'm going to cast Chill Touch
on the salamander. Ranged spell attack. All right.

03:39:29.937 --> 03:39:37.725
I want to use this one. Oh, that's terrible!
That is an eight.

03:39:37.725 --> 03:39:40.067
SAM: Yeah, it hits the pillar in front of him.

03:39:40.067 --> 03:39:42.614
LIAM: So a ghostly hand grabs the pillar and
nothing happens.

03:39:42.614 --> 03:39:44.234
SAM: Absolutely. Ricochets off.

03:39:44.234 --> 03:39:46.954
LIAM: That was an action.

03:39:46.954 --> 03:39:55.677
SAM: Now you have to solve another lock riddle.
You can move; you can do a bonus action.

03:39:55.677 --> 03:40:02.714
LIAM: Yes, I'm going to move. I'll move myself.
Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30. I'm just going to be

03:40:02.714 --> 03:40:03.986
right there.

03:40:03.986 --> 03:40:05.352
SAM: Okay, Kingston, you're up. Do something.

03:40:05.352 --> 03:40:10.925
BRIAN: For my action, I will cast Cure Wounds on
myself, because I am so low.

03:40:10.925 --> 03:40:15.867
SAM: On yourself. There's a dead person next to
you, it's all good, but sure. Yeah, go ahead.

03:40:15.867 --> 03:40:19.149
LIAM: To the home audience: choose the Luck feat.

03:40:19.149 --> 03:40:24.969
BRIAN: You know what? Oh yeah, she is unconscious.
Where is she?

03:40:24.969 --> 03:40:27.918
SAM: Here.

03:40:27.918 --> 03:40:29.834
BRIAN: Oh yeah, okay. You know what?

03:40:29.834 --> 03:40:33.539
LIAM: Whoa, she's unconscious?

03:40:33.539 --> 03:40:38.006
SAM: Yeah, you can retroactively bonus action,
sure.

03:40:38.006 --> 03:40:45.326
LIAM: I can? Oh, good. Instead, while everyone's
focused on the salamander, I'm going to loop the

03:40:45.326 --> 03:40:49.419
whip around, and yank, and twist her neck.

03:40:49.419 --> 03:40:54.027
SAM: In an instant, you feel the life drain out of
you.

03:40:54.027 --> 03:40:56.254
LIAM: That's two death saves, is what that is.

03:40:56.254 --> 03:41:02.125
ASHLY: I only clotheslined people so I could feel
human warmth!

03:41:02.125 --> 03:41:06.172
SAM: Even though you are unconscious, you still
feel shitty.

03:41:06.172 --> 03:41:10.497
BRIAN: Wait, but he does that before I can change
my mind about healing--

03:41:10.497 --> 03:41:14.150
LIAM: And on her turn, she has to make a death
save. If she fails it, she's a goner.

03:41:14.150 --> 03:41:17.753
SAM: Sure, but now it's Brian's turn, and he gets
to decide what to do.

03:41:17.753 --> 03:41:21.860
BRIAN: All right, well now that it's my turn, and
we definitely haven't decided what I'm going to do

03:41:21.860 --> 03:41:36.715
with it yet, I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on...
Clothesline. 1d8 plus my spellcasting modifier.

03:41:36.715 --> 03:41:39.314
SAM: You're using this as a bonus action?

03:41:39.314 --> 03:41:43.404
BRIAN: No, my regular-ass action. Because I'm
fine.

03:41:43.404 --> 03:41:46.764
SAM: It is a bonus action. You can also use a real
spell.

03:41:46.764 --> 03:41:49.217
BRIAN: Wait, I just asked that earlier, and you
said no!

03:41:49.217 --> 03:41:50.872
SAM: What are you talking about?

03:41:50.872 --> 03:41:53.134
BRIAN: I asked if I could use a spell on my bonus
action, and you said no.

03:41:53.134 --> 03:41:54.334
SAM: You said if you could use a cantrip.

03:41:54.334 --> 03:41:55.913
BRIAN: I asked if I could use a cantrip?

03:41:55.913 --> 03:41:57.887
SAM: That's a level one spell.

03:41:57.887 --> 03:42:07.465
BRIAN: I don't have bonus actions as a wizard,
yet, so I'm confused. Okay, so for my action, I

03:42:07.465 --> 03:42:15.803
will-- fuck. I'm going to do Vicious Mockery at
Frank Grillo.

03:42:15.803 --> 03:42:17.373
SAM: Okay, go ahead.

03:42:17.373 --> 03:42:21.484
LIAM: At who? Frank Grillo?

03:42:21.484 --> 03:42:22.909
MARY: Who's Frank Grillo?

03:42:22.909 --> 03:42:26.707
ERIC: I'm Frank Grillo.

03:42:26.707 --> 03:42:32.475
BRIAN: That's 1d4 of psychic damage.

03:42:32.475 --> 03:42:34.830
SAM: Sure, I've got to make a save.

03:42:34.830 --> 03:42:37.706
BRIAN: Yeah, you have to make a fucking wisdom
save.

03:42:37.706 --> 03:42:39.125
SAM: Wisdom save?

03:42:39.125 --> 03:42:40.988
BRIAN: Yes, wisdom save.

03:42:40.988 --> 03:42:47.551
SAM: Okay. I do not make it. 2d8. Go ahead.

03:42:47.551 --> 03:42:49.667
BRIAN: Oh, yeah? Oh.

03:42:49.667 --> 03:42:51.731
SAM: Wait, what is this? This is Vicious Mockery.

03:42:51.731 --> 03:43:01.477
BRIAN: It's 1d4. I was gone for a minute, but I'm
back now. Sit the fuck back down. Seem like

03:43:01.477 --> 03:43:03.626
everyday nowaday Hollywood-- Three.

03:43:03.626 --> 03:43:09.413
SAM: Okay. Of psychic damage? And he has
disadvantage on his next attack, which he already

03:43:09.413 --> 03:43:10.575
had. So great.

03:43:10.575 --> 03:43:12.300
BRIAN: I'mma show these motherfuckers how to act
now.

03:43:12.300 --> 03:43:15.933
SAM: Okay, you also get your bonus action, which
you can use to heal--

03:43:15.933 --> 03:43:18.758
BRIAN: My bonus action will be to cure my
beloved.

03:43:18.758 --> 03:43:20.678
SAM: How would you like to talk to her to cure
her?

03:43:20.678 --> 03:43:23.861
BRIAN: I have to talk to her to cure her?

03:43:23.861 --> 03:43:26.491
SAM: It's Healing Word, you have to say a word of
healing.

03:43:26.491 --> 03:43:28.644
BRAIN: Oh, Cure Wounds?

03:43:28.644 --> 03:43:34.493
SAM: Cure Wounds? Okay, that is a real spell; that
takes an action. It's okay, just do Healing Word, bud.

03:43:34.493 --> 03:43:43.277
BRIAN: Oh fuck, yeah. Okay. Healing Word is--

03:43:43.277 --> 03:43:45.946
SAM: 1d4 plus something, four, maybe?

03:43:45.946 --> 03:43:57.491
BRIAN: (singing) I love Greep. I love cat people.
What the hell am I doing here? That's a two.

03:43:57.491 --> 03:44:00.306
SAM: Great, you've got two hit points; you're
alive.

03:44:00.306 --> 03:44:04.780
BRIAN: Sorry it's not more, but hopefully it's
enough to get us maybe a date, later?

03:44:04.780 --> 03:44:14.856
SAM: Kingston just saved you. Clothesline, you are
alive. It is your turn. She's prone.

03:44:14.856 --> 03:44:16.716
ASHLY: I'm prone? What can I do, then?

03:44:16.716 --> 03:44:19.139
LIAM: You can get up. It's half your movement, but
you can fuck me up, still.

03:44:19.139 --> 03:44:25.442
ASHLY: I can get up? Then I am going to
clothesline that motherfucker there.

03:44:25.442 --> 03:44:27.645
SAM: Great. Roll an attack?

03:44:27.645 --> 03:44:29.858
LIAM: I haven't lost a hit point this entire
game.

03:44:29.858 --> 03:44:31.093
ASHLY: Natural 20!

03:44:31.093 --> 03:44:33.454
(cheering)

03:44:33.454 --> 03:44:37.478
SAM: That certainly hits. Roll 1d4 plus four?

03:44:37.478 --> 03:44:42.392
ASHLY: Come on, baby. Three plus four is seven.

03:44:42.392 --> 03:44:43.925
SAM: Double it. 14.

03:44:43.925 --> 03:44:48.117
LIAM: No, the dice are doubled.

03:44:48.117 --> 03:44:53.000
SAM: It's ten. It's ten. And you're not knocked
prone.

03:44:53.000 --> 03:44:54.760
ASHLY: Did I take my second action surge?

03:44:54.760 --> 03:44:56.129
SAM: No. Do it.

03:44:56.129 --> 03:45:00.624
ASHLY: I'm going to clothesline you again! A
natural 20!

03:45:00.624 --> 03:45:02.194
(cheering)

03:45:02.194 --> 03:45:06.067
LIAM: What the fuck is that? Get out of this
building!

03:45:06.067 --> 03:45:12.478
MARY: Buy this die. You can sell this die for
millions.

03:45:12.478 --> 03:45:17.821
SAM: So Clothesline turns around, delivers a
right-armed clothesline to you. It hurts. She

03:45:17.821 --> 03:45:22.370
kisses her bicep, uses the other arm. Left-arm
clothesline on you.

03:45:22.370 --> 03:45:24.927
ASHLY: Give me a four, baby, give me a four. A
four!

03:45:24.927 --> 03:45:26.070
SAM: A four!

03:45:26.070 --> 03:45:27.589
ASHLY: And you're prone, motherfucker.

03:45:27.589 --> 03:45:33.174
LIAM: Do the Leonidas handshake with me; that was
amazing.

03:45:33.174 --> 03:45:37.477
SAM: That's 22 total points of damage, and you are
prone. The double clothesline.

03:45:37.477 --> 03:45:39.468
LIAM: In addition to the last attack?

03:45:39.468 --> 03:45:41.492
SAM: No, that's total. 22 total.

03:45:41.492 --> 03:45:46.747
MARY: So what did you say right before she rolled?
You had taken no hit points? Say it again out loud.

03:45:46.747 --> 03:45:48.809
ASHLY: Yeah, say it, please.

03:45:48.809 --> 03:45:51.090
LIAM: No hit points, to all the hit points.

03:45:51.090 --> 03:45:52.474
ASHLY: All of your hit points?

03:45:52.474 --> 03:45:53.652
LIAM: No, not all.

03:45:53.652 --> 03:45:58.745
ASHLY: Damn it. Wait, he gave me the 1d6--

03:45:58.745 --> 03:46:07.826
SAM: Oh, that wouldn't be useful here, anyway. Do
that on a save. Eric, it is your turn. What do you

03:46:07.826 --> 03:46:09.366
want to do?

03:46:09.366 --> 03:46:17.758
ERIC: I mean, my knowledge of his association with
Chain of Oblivion.

03:46:17.758 --> 03:46:26.059
SAM: Sure. When Jayne falls, you see very clearly
the symbol of the Chained Oblivion, and the

03:46:26.059 --> 03:46:33.392
tattoos under her skin, clearly exposed now that
she's lying on the floor, white skin revealed.

03:46:33.392 --> 03:46:42.110
She's definitely a servant of the Chained
Oblivion, whom you are sworn to kill.

03:46:42.110 --> 03:46:52.869
ERIC: You know, it's my first time playing. But it
clearly states that you raided my village, and I

03:46:52.869 --> 03:47:01.948
have sworn an oath to seek revenge on the cult, or
anyone associated with the cult of the Chained

03:47:01.948 --> 03:47:10.530
Oblivion, so I would like to continue the attack
on Jayne.

03:47:10.530 --> 03:47:13.227
LIAM: Only the best people are in the cult. You'd
be surprised.

03:47:13.227 --> 03:47:16.917
ERIC: And I choose to do so with my maul.

03:47:16.917 --> 03:47:21.539
SAM: Yes, please. Two-handed strike, go for it.
Roll for an attack.

03:47:21.539 --> 03:47:29.528
LIAM: Not great, but hold on. Five plus six is 11.
I'm sorry, that does not hit. I'm so sorry.

03:47:29.528 --> 03:47:32.309
ERIC: Man, I just revealed my hand.

03:47:32.309 --> 03:47:37.970
SAM: Hold on, let me just look at you, see if you
have any extra things--

03:47:37.970 --> 03:47:42.499
BRIAN: My ex-wife said you didn't know how to use
them.

03:47:42.499 --> 03:47:47.192
MARY: Apparently, he knew how to use other
things.

03:47:47.192 --> 03:47:49.665
SAM: Okay, you know what?

03:47:49.665 --> 03:47:51.400
BRIAN: His dwarven hammer, perhaps.

03:47:51.400 --> 03:47:53.631
SAM: If you wanted to--

03:47:53.631 --> 03:48:00.048
LIAM: This salamander is like, "Look at these
assholes fighting amongst themselves!"

03:48:00.048 --> 03:48:05.533
SAM: I'm just going to suggest to you that we're
late in the night; you might have used Vow of

03:48:05.533 --> 03:48:10.965
Enmity as a bonus action to give you an advantage
on this attack, so you could roll again.

03:48:10.965 --> 03:48:14.021
ERIC: I did write it down and circle it.

03:48:14.021 --> 03:48:19.442
LIAM: So you could cast it on me, which you would
do, as a paladin who hates the Chained Oblivion.

03:48:19.442 --> 03:48:21.285
So roll again; if you do better, you hit me.

03:48:21.285 --> 03:48:25.206
ERIC: I will cast my bowels of Enmity.

03:48:25.206 --> 03:48:32.605
SAM: You've shat on the floor. It's an angry
poop.

03:48:32.605 --> 03:48:40.332
ERIC: I would like to use my Imodium AD and come
right in. Five again!

03:48:40.332 --> 03:48:46.575
MARY: It was meant to be. You convinced him to use
it, is the thing.

03:48:46.575 --> 03:48:52.966
SAM: Blinded by your hatred of the Chained
Oblivion, you can't seem to make contact with your

03:48:52.966 --> 03:49:01.100
maul, and instead you swipe to the left, hitting
the old lady in the face. Killing her. Again.

03:49:01.100 --> 03:49:03.455
ERIC: Problem solved, guys.

03:49:03.455 --> 03:49:05.920
MARY: Sorry, random newcomer.

03:49:05.920 --> 03:49:13.761
SAM: That's Frank's turn. We're onto the
salamander, who is going to use half his movement

03:49:13.761 --> 03:49:19.868
to attack Gryffin. Rolls an eight plus seven. 15?

03:49:19.868 --> 03:49:21.453
MARY: Nope.

03:49:21.453 --> 03:49:35.470
SAM: Okay. Second attack. That hits, that's a
20-something. Okay. Eight plus four. 12. Oh boy.

03:49:35.470 --> 03:49:45.992
Plus seven. Okay, so it's 12 bludgeoning damage
and seven fire damage.

03:49:45.992 --> 03:49:47.960
MARY: The fire is halved.

03:49:47.960 --> 03:49:58.529
SAM: Okay, so 12 plus two then, right? 14? Roll a
dexterity saving throw to see if you're grappled.

03:49:58.529 --> 03:50:06.681
You know what, it doesn't matter; he's not going
to grapple you. He's moving. The portal is fully

03:50:06.681 --> 03:50:10.077
open. He grabs Holly, he puts one leg in. That's
as far as he can get.

03:50:10.077 --> 03:50:12.097
LIAM: He's got no legs.

03:50:12.097 --> 03:50:22.243
SAM: I'm sorry. It's one penis in. He walks on 100
penises. He's like a centipede-- he's like a

03:50:22.243 --> 03:50:30.464
centipene. It is Gryffin's turn.

03:50:30.464 --> 03:50:36.896
MARY: I take out my Wand of Entanglement, and I
whip it at motherfucking salamander.

03:50:36.896 --> 03:50:38.556
SAM: I don't know what that is. What does he do?

03:50:38.556 --> 03:50:40.418
MARY: I entangle him.

03:50:40.418 --> 03:50:41.522
SAM: Automatically?

03:50:41.522 --> 03:50:50.130
MARY: Yeah, I don't know. It's fun, isn't it?

03:50:50.130 --> 03:50:51.914
SAM: It's the Entangle spell.

03:50:51.914 --> 03:50:55.520
MARY: It's the Entangle spell, and I have a wand
that does it--

03:50:55.520 --> 03:50:58.953
SAM: I might have written this on your card. Hold
on, let me look.

03:50:58.953 --> 03:51:01.254
MARY: I hope so, because it's going to take me a
second to find it.

03:51:01.254 --> 03:51:15.312
SAM: Here it is. 20 foot square versus strength.
14 save. He makes his save.

03:51:15.312 --> 03:51:18.794
You still get a bonus action.

03:51:18.794 --> 03:51:25.133
MARY: Okay, well my bonus would be-- are you
allowing the cantrips as a bonus?

03:51:25.133 --> 03:51:26.649
SAM: Sure, man. Go for it.

03:51:26.649 --> 03:51:28.407
MARY: Ray of Frost.

03:51:28.407 --> 03:51:29.554
SAM: Yep, do it.

03:51:29.554 --> 03:51:32.907
BRIAN: Maybe a little dinner and some laser
pointer?

03:51:32.907 --> 03:51:34.358
ASHLY: Okay, don't push it.

03:51:34.358 --> 03:51:36.925
MARY: 22.

03:51:36.925 --> 03:51:42.272
SAM: He looks back at you and says, "Fuck you, you
can't catch me," and you hit him square in the

03:51:42.272 --> 03:51:45.169
face. Roll for damage.

03:51:45.169 --> 03:51:47.080
MARY: Yes, I fucking can.

03:51:47.080 --> 03:51:48.710
SAM: 1d8 cold.

03:51:48.710 --> 03:51:52.680
MARY: 1d8 cold. Five.

03:51:52.680 --> 03:52:00.157
SAM: Five. He has ten hit points left, but cold
damage is doubled. How do you want to--

03:52:00.157 --> 03:52:02.247
(cheering)

03:52:02.247 --> 03:52:07.381
SAM: How do you want to kill this?

03:52:07.381 --> 03:52:15.939
MARY: From my hand, comes a spear that hits him
square in the jaw, as he-- what did he say?

03:52:15.939 --> 03:52:20.359
SAM: "Fuck you. You can't fucking catch me!"

03:52:20.359 --> 03:52:26.806
MARY: And at that moment, it goes (impact). Well,
you figure it out.

03:52:26.806 --> 03:52:33.136
SAM: Yeah, not only does it bisect his tongue, it
splits his head open all the way back to the back

03:52:33.136 --> 03:52:39.157
of his neck, protruding out the back. When it goes
behind him, your cold spear-- it's a cold spear?

03:52:39.157 --> 03:52:46.124
Enters the portal and instantly melts, because
it's so fucking hot in there. His head splits in

03:52:46.124 --> 03:52:53.868
half, and he falls to the side, next to a frazzled
and crazed Holly, who is looking at this with open

03:52:53.868 --> 03:52:55.118
eyes; she hasn't said a word.

03:52:55.118 --> 03:52:57.020
BRIAN: Holly's going to need some therapy after
this.

03:52:57.020 --> 03:53:02.578
MARY: Holly! Holly, we're here, don't worry, it's
all right. Move towards me. Get away from that thing.

03:53:02.578 --> 03:53:11.473
LIAM: Wait, before we move forward, I know that
I'm after Gryffin. Yes. So because that is so, I

03:53:11.473 --> 03:53:18.055
would like to attack the tabaxi with my whip,
now.

03:53:18.055 --> 03:53:21.441
MARY: He's just got a thing for your love.

03:53:21.441 --> 03:53:27.243
BRIAN: She's not doing anything to her that I
think is worthy of this.

03:53:27.243 --> 03:53:30.179
LIAM: That is a 13 to hit?

03:53:30.179 --> 03:53:32.815
ASHLY: 18 armor class, my friend.

03:53:32.815 --> 03:53:44.249
LIAM: Fuck. Okay, I'm going to start to run. One,
two, three, four, five, six. Okay?

03:53:44.249 --> 03:53:50.867
SAM: Okay, good. As the defeated salamander lies
motionless on the floor, there's a brief moment of

03:53:50.867 --> 03:53:56.052
calm. You look around the room. Just moments ago,
you were strangers, but at the Ass Sailor,

03:53:56.052 --> 03:54:02.992
anything is possible. The girl, Holly, finally
speaks. She steps forward and says, "Thank you,

03:54:02.992 --> 03:54:09.079
"kind souls. I know not why you have rescued me,
but my people will be grateful, and you will be

03:54:09.079 --> 03:54:15.342
"rewarded handsomely for your goodness. I can sense
that many of you do not trust each other."

03:54:15.342 --> 03:54:17.597
ASHLY: Can I run after Liam?

03:54:17.597 --> 03:54:22.258
LIAM: Six seconds have passed. One, two, three,
four, five, six.

03:54:22.258 --> 03:54:25.797
SAM: "Please, don't leave, Clothesline. I'm not
done with my speech."

03:54:25.797 --> 03:54:32.976
MARY: Jayne's running like Tom fucking Cruise.

03:54:32.976 --> 03:54:36.137
SAM: She casts Hold Person on you.

03:54:36.137 --> 03:54:37.753
ASHLY: Goddamn it.

03:54:37.753 --> 03:54:45.654
SAM: On Clothesline. "I ask you, as one caring
creature to another, to put aside your differences

03:54:45.654 --> 03:54:55.568
"and marvel in what you have accomplished here
together, as more than strangers, as friends. I

03:54:55.568 --> 03:55:01.426
"must leave now, but you will see me again. And as
I leave you, I suggest you remember these words of

03:55:01.426 --> 03:55:09.323
"advice: snitches get stitches. If you talk to the
police, try not to tell them too much, for all our sakes."

03:55:09.323 --> 03:55:17.279
And with that, she poof, disappears. And suddenly,
in the back of the room, holding Jayne in his

03:55:17.279 --> 03:55:27.433
arms, a gruff man constable and ten armed guards
beside him enter the room and say, "Freeze! All of

03:55:27.433 --> 03:55:37.312
"you, hold it right there, you fuckwads. We caught
your little albino freak trying to run away. You

03:55:37.312 --> 03:55:42.568
"five made quite the fucking mess upstairs, you
know that? Dead hookers, burned up old ladies,

03:55:42.568 --> 03:55:49.014
"some guy talking about a fucking rat. It's going
to take days to mop this shit up, and you're going

03:55:49.014 --> 03:55:53.815
"to help me figure out what the shit happened.
That's right: you're all under arrest. Boys, bring

03:55:53.815 --> 03:55:59.164
"them down to the station; I'm going to interrogate
every single one of them until they talk, and talk

03:55:59.164 --> 03:56:00.423
"they will."

03:56:00.423 --> 03:56:04.912
As the police take you into custody, marching you
back up through the ruined bar, you notice

03:56:04.912 --> 03:56:13.232
Valerie, the bartender, frazzled, removing her
apron, letting out a big sigh, mounting her horse

03:56:13.232 --> 03:56:16.878
for the long, cold ride home. The end.

03:56:16.878 --> 03:56:21.917
(cheering)

03:56:21.917 --> 03:56:23.675
SAM: I'm spent.

03:56:23.675 --> 03:56:27.041
LIAM: Takes a lot of concentration, yeah?

03:56:27.041 --> 03:56:28.207
SAM: Oh my god.

03:56:28.207 --> 03:56:30.330
MARY: Sam, that was amazing!

03:56:30.330 --> 03:56:33.760
SAM: That's hard, dudes.

03:56:33.760 --> 03:56:37.372
MARY: I loved the interrogation mid-way through.
That was so cool.

03:56:37.372 --> 03:56:41.183
LIAM: Ashly, we all lived, so it's like we're all
winners, right?

03:56:41.183 --> 03:56:45.014
ASHLY: Is that really what it's like, Liam? Is
that what it's like?

03:56:45.014 --> 03:56:47.533
BRIAN: How many did you have left, two? I had
seven.

03:56:47.533 --> 03:56:49.505
MARY: I was 12.

03:56:49.505 --> 03:56:53.258
LIAM: I kept trying to take away those two hit
points for so long!

03:56:53.258 --> 03:56:55.683
MARY: Eric's like, "I got full strength, I got
full power."

03:56:55.683 --> 03:56:58.596
ERIC: Play neutral, that's how I play it. In any
game.

03:56:58.596 --> 03:57:04.677
SAM: What items did you find and not use? The
Snuff Box of Jump?

03:57:04.677 --> 03:57:08.209
MARY: The Snuff Box of Jump was pretty cool.

03:57:08.209 --> 03:57:15.952
SAM: Yeah, you snort coke and get Jump. You also
didn't find the super weird porno book or the jug

03:57:15.952 --> 03:57:17.505
of nasty grease.

03:57:17.505 --> 03:57:19.943
MARY: When would I have used the Scroll of Feather
Fall, though?

03:57:19.943 --> 03:57:22.205
SAM: Oh, that was something that you guys didn't
go to.

03:57:22.205 --> 03:57:27.174
LIAM: If I could have rolled a critical hit one
time, like you did three times, I could have

03:57:27.174 --> 03:57:30.029
one-hit killed any of you. Any of you.

03:57:30.029 --> 03:57:34.523
SAM: Yeah, he has this special whip that if people
get weak enough, you die.

03:57:34.523 --> 03:57:40.001
MARY: So I thought it was like a Finger of Death,
I wasn't sure; it seemed to be very Fingery of Deathy.

03:57:40.001 --> 03:57:42.250
SAM: Sort of. Oh, it was fingery all right.

03:57:42.250 --> 03:57:44.253
ERIC: Who was Garello?

03:57:44.253 --> 03:57:49.232
SAM: Oh, Garello was a.k.a. Sal the Salamander.

03:57:49.232 --> 03:57:52.743
MARY: Yes! I killed Garello!

03:57:52.743 --> 03:57:57.858
SAM: You were being paid to transport this girl
here to them, you don't know who was paying him.

03:57:57.858 --> 03:58:01.043
ERIC: So it would've been bad if I had found
Garello.

03:58:01.043 --> 03:58:05.038
SAM: Yes, it would've been bad if you'd found him.
He would've taken the girl, and taken her back to

03:58:05.038 --> 03:58:09.064
his land to do some untold badness to her.

03:58:09.064 --> 03:58:11.444
BRIAN: Man, magic did not work well tonight.

03:58:11.444 --> 03:58:14.573
MARY: Magic, it didn't work in the first half. It
worked better in the basement than it did

03:58:14.573 --> 03:58:20.001
upstairs. Once I'd figured out-- the first thing
that I hit him with was frost, and that was

03:58:20.001 --> 03:58:27.226
upstairs, and I was like oh, he totally, English
football (squeals). And I was like, oh, okay.

03:58:27.226 --> 03:58:34.276
SAM: Guys, this was so much fun. I hope it was fun
for you. A big silent hand for Brian Foster, Mary

03:58:34.276 --> 03:58:39.324
Elizabeth McGlynn, Ashly Burch, Liam O'Brien, and
Eric Bauza.

03:58:39.324 --> 03:58:41.078
ASHLY: And to Sam Riegel!

03:58:41.078 --> 03:58:48.351
SAM: Thanks, guys. I'm going to go home and sleep,
and then I'll see you in the morning.

03:58:48.351 --> 03:58:55.972
LIAM: Thank you to Matthew Mercer, who does this
week after week after week.

03:58:55.972 --> 03:58:57.901
MARY: Eric, how do you feel? First time playing.

03:58:57.901 --> 03:59:03.991
ERIC: Pretty good, I called so many of my friends
that actually do play for advice, and one of them,

03:59:03.991 --> 03:59:08.076
Graham Lunam, who I said I'd call out-- because
he's a huge fan, he's a Canadian, watching

03:59:08.076 --> 03:59:12.804
probably right now-- he's been texting me, saying
I've been doing a good job. But I would totally

03:59:12.804 --> 03:59:16.315
come back again, but thank you for having me.

03:59:16.315 --> 03:59:18.582
SAM: No, thank you for getting dressed up for the
occasion.

03:59:18.582 --> 03:59:28.886
ERIC: I kept the AC going in the Uber, but of
course I've got to cover my Olive Garden shift.

03:59:28.886 --> 03:59:32.174
BRIAN: I'd like to thank my attorney, Eric Bauza,
for coming tonight to play with us.

03:59:32.174 --> 03:59:39.358
SAM: Have a good night, everyone. Check us out on
Tuesday for Talks Machina; we'll be talking about

03:59:39.358 --> 03:59:46.924
the game and stuff. Congrats again to
CholieAmenthys for winning the thing, and-- what

03:59:46.924 --> 03:59:48.077
do I say now?

03:59:48.077 --> 03:59:49.348
MARY: Yay, you say yay, Sam.

03:59:49.348 --> 03:59:55.875
SAM: And now, is it Thursday yet? Goodnight,
everyone.

03:59:55.875 --> 04:06:48.361
