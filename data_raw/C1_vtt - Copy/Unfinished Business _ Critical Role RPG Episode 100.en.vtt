nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.503 --> 00:00:09.768

this as long as we have, and enjoying it as much

00:01:04.724 --> 00:01:10.624
as we have every step of the way. Thank you to
everyone here at Geek &amp; Sundry that brought us in,

the Extended Puppy comic series

00:05:02.267 --> 00:05:03.748

00:05:03.748 --> 00:05:08.263
SAM: We're also supposed to give a quick shoutout
to Backblaze for sponsoring the first set of

00:05:08.263 --> 00:05:09.508
episodes of...

00:05:09.508 --> 00:05:13.839
MATT: Of, if you want to go ahead and discuss
this-- who wants to pick this up? We have--

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:18.014
SAM: Did I skip? Did I skip? It says on my page!
I'm sorry!

00:05:18.014 --> 00:05:24.047
MARISHA: No, it's okay. As a lot of people already
probably know, we announced it in our press

00:05:24.047 --> 00:05:30.872
rollout, but in honor of the hundredth episode, we
now have episodes zero-- which is all of our

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:38.213
backstories-- through ten in podcast form.
Critical Role podcast. And then what's going to

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:44.134
start happening is, towards the end of the month,
we want to start rolling out one a day, on work

00:05:44.134 --> 00:05:54.332
days. Five a week. Don't kill us. All right? Every
day to catch up, 'til we get back on track.

00:05:54.332 --> 00:05:56.300
TRAVIS: (sings) It's the end of the month.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.400
TRAVIS &amp; MATT: (sings) Wake up, wake up, wake up,
It's the end of the month.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.499
TRAVIS: Bone Thugs? Thank you, Matt.

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:05.445
MARISHA: There's a podcast.

00:06:05.445 --> 00:06:11.308

it on Google.

00:06:11.308 --> 00:06:13.736

00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:24.534
LAURA: Can we talk-- can we talk about this thing
now?

00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:28.859
MATT: Yes, we can. So, getting into our merch and
part of the celebration of the hundredth episode,

00:06:28.859 --> 00:06:30.341
Laura. What have you got in store?

00:06:30.341 --> 00:06:35.183
LAURA: Oh, well, thank you for asking, Matthew.
Well, number one, we have our amazing Scanlan

00:06:35.183 --> 00:06:36.392
concert tees.

00:06:36.392 --> 00:06:37.361
MATT: Yes.

00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:44.250
LAURA: As being worn by the buff and glorious Sam
Riegel. Gorgeous. Just gorgeous, with all the tour

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:53.388
cities on the back and everything. And then, also,
a commemorative item for the hundredth episode. We

00:06:53.388 --> 00:07:01.563
worked with David Mack-- Who is, like, this
amazing artist. He's-- you know him. Tell some of

00:07:01.563 --> 00:07:02.650
his work, 'cause--

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.234
LIAM: Oh my gosh, he does covers for everything.
Daredevil--

00:07:05.234 --> 00:07:12.257
LAURA: Jessica Jones, I saw Jessica Jones work.
Kabuki. All of it. So he does this amazing

00:07:12.257 --> 00:07:17.352
watercolor work and he did an amazing art print
for us, so--

00:07:17.352 --> 00:07:18.404
LIAM: Here it is.

00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:20.527
LAURA: Without further ado.

00:07:20.527 --> 00:07:21.991
(cheering)

00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:24.000
LIAM: (sings) Look at this motherfucker.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.714
SAM: The intensity. The glamor.

00:07:26.714 --> 00:07:27.940
LIAM: The splatter.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.512
LAURA: I mean, I'm so excited about this. Number
one, just because it looks so freaking amazing.

00:07:32.512 --> 00:07:38.449
But then, he incorporated all of this amazing
stuff like quotes and everything that has to do

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:45.009
with the characters, and things that mean so much
to us as the characters. And he just worked with

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:48.018
us nonstop to try to make the most amazing thing
for you guys,

00:07:48.018 --> 00:07:50.579
and I'm so proud of it and so happy.

00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:51.902
LIAM: It's farkin' beautiful.

00:07:51.902 --> 00:07:55.678
LAURA: And we have this amazing gold emblem in the
bottom. I don't know if you can tell, but it's

00:07:55.678 --> 00:08:03.195
like extra shiny and fancy. It's a special Vex.
And the paper's really heavy, and so it's super,

00:08:03.195 --> 00:08:04.548
super special. So--

00:08:04.548 --> 00:08:09.615
ASHLEY: It feels like it was-- like it's a
one-of-a-kind watercolor. Like that's what it-- up

00:08:09.615 --> 00:08:10.907
close, it's crazy.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:12.429
LAURA: It looks like he painted it on the page.

00:08:12.429 --> 00:08:13.606
SAM: 400 thread count.

00:08:13.606 --> 00:08:14.888
(laughter)

00:08:14.888 --> 00:08:16.273
MATT: And we're only selling the one.

00:08:16.273 --> 00:08:17.480
LAURA: Venetian silk.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.168
LIAM: Also, like our shirts that you can't tell
how soft they are until you're wearing them, like

00:08:21.168 --> 00:08:25.517
the Joe Mad poster that was so beautiful but until
you saw it in person you didn't get it. This thing

00:08:25.517 --> 00:08:27.613
in person is unbelievable.

00:08:27.613 --> 00:08:33.683
LAURA: So yeah. This will be available for one
month and one month only in the Geek and Sundry

00:08:33.683 --> 00:08:39.534
store starting today. And then after that, it is
gone. And we're doing the same thing that we did

00:08:39.534 --> 00:08:44.147
last time, which is also offering a limited
edition signed version, so if you guys want to

00:08:44.147 --> 00:08:48.384
check that out, that's only available for three
weeks so we can try to get as many signatures

00:08:48.384 --> 00:08:49.841
before Ashley has to leave.

00:08:49.841 --> 00:08:51.086
ASHLEY: Sorry.

00:08:51.086 --> 00:08:52.413
TRAVIS: (sings) Sorry.

00:08:52.413 --> 00:08:56.780
LAURA: So yeah, three weeks from today you can get
the autographed. Starting today, only for three

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.668
weeks, and then it's gone forever from the store.

00:08:59.668 --> 00:09:01.160
TRAVIS: We already got copies, right?

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.274
LAURA: We already have copies, yeah.

00:09:02.274 --> 00:09:03.530
ASHLEY: I love it so much.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:08.157
LAURA: Thank you David. Thank you for being
amazing. We love you.

00:09:08.157 --> 00:09:10.058
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's so nice.

00:09:10.058 --> 00:09:15.452
MATT: Thank you, David. Really appreciate it, man.
Awesome. And what else you guys got?

00:09:15.452 --> 00:09:26.809
MARISHA: So, The Slayer's Cake-- the members of
The Slayer's Cake-- Yes, have a new product they

00:09:26.809 --> 00:09:28.116
have just released.

00:09:28.116 --> 00:09:29.585
SAM: Is it a baked good of some sort?

00:09:29.585 --> 00:09:30.575
MARISHA: Well...

00:09:30.575 --> 00:09:31.601
LAURA: We should show them.

00:09:31.601 --> 00:09:36.499
MARISHA: I think, you know, they worked so hard on
making a commercial, so we should let them--

00:09:36.499 --> 00:09:38.321
LAURA: We should let them talk about it.

00:09:38.321 --> 00:09:42.270
MARISHA: So here is a commercial from The Slayer's
Cake.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:50.287
SAM: Oh, hello there. I'm Taryon Darrington of The
Slayer's Cake. The Slayer's Cake, your pals in a

00:09:50.287 --> 00:09:56.293
pastry pinch. Go now? Okay. (clears throat)
Heading to a fancy banquet and not sure if your

00:09:56.293 --> 00:10:02.726
hosts are undead? (gasps) Slayer's Cake. Say it's
Winter's Crest, and you don't know what to get

00:10:02.726 --> 00:10:07.460
your secret Sarenrae. Possibly because you've
never given a gift before. It could happen.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:13.487
Slayer's Cake! We even have miniature cakes for
that special gnome-one in your life.

00:10:13.487 --> 00:10:15.194
LAURA: Those are cupcakes, Tary!

00:10:15.194 --> 00:10:20.187
SAM: Oh, okay, well, I mean, mm! But hey, if I
still haven't convinced you,

00:10:20.187 --> 00:10:32.883
don't take my word for it!

00:10:32.883 --> 00:10:33.959
Are we still--

00:10:33.959 --> 00:10:42.624
LAURA: Mm, delicious.

00:10:42.624 --> 00:10:50.741
ASHLEY: Wow, so light, and I would know, I'm a
cleric. Er, what?

00:10:50.819 --> 00:10:56.898
SAM: So come on down to the Slayer's Cake, located
in downtown Whitestone. Look for the big

00:10:56.898 --> 00:11:02.992
unsanitary bear. You can't miss it! And don't
forget, don't step in bear shit!

00:11:02.992 --> 00:11:09.263
MARISHA: Bumper VO. The Slayer's Cake, open till
6PM, 7 on weekends. Closed Thursdays for

00:11:09.263 --> 00:11:15.087
adventuring. Slayer's Cake aprons available now.
What? We have aprons?

00:11:15.087 --> 00:11:17.240
Tary, you didn't tell me we have aprons!

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.542
(cheering)

00:11:20.542 --> 00:11:31.591
LAURA: Wait, wait, can you see me? There it is! So
we had the aprons made, which we're so excited

00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:39.691
about. I didn't do it, Ben did it, and he's
amazing. Ben did this! He made cupcakes with the

00:11:39.691 --> 00:11:47.274
Slayer's Cake logo for us for the 100th episode.
We can eat them! So I'm passing them around.

00:11:47.274 --> 00:11:49.755
ASHLEY: What if we save them forever?

00:11:49.755 --> 00:12:00.369
LAURA: I'm just so excited about this, you guys! I
kind of just wanted to get the apron made so I

00:12:00.369 --> 00:12:02.060
could personally have it.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.195
MARISHA: I know, I know!

00:12:03.195 --> 00:12:05.027
TRAVIS: She's not lying. She wanted to have the
apron.

00:12:05.027 --> 00:12:07.951
TALIESIN: Oh! Cupcake down!

00:12:07.951 --> 00:12:10.413
MARISHA: It's fine, it's fine. Don't worry about
it. I'm taking that one.

00:12:10.413 --> 00:12:16.425
LAURA: I don't know if I want to wear this the
whole episode. I might. I'm going to hang out. Oh

00:12:16.425 --> 00:12:18.628
yeah, save a cupcake for Jon. Wait, Matthew!

00:12:18.628 --> 00:12:20.162
TALIESIN: Matt, Matt!

00:12:20.162 --> 00:12:31.308
MATT: I don't want any of your shit! Don't want
it! Brian, eat it. I don't want it. Don't! I have

00:12:31.308 --> 00:12:32.558
things to do!

00:12:32.558 --> 00:12:34.180
MARISHA: Give it to Heder, give it to Heder!

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.191
TALIESIN: Heder's got one.

00:12:35.191 --> 00:12:42.708
MATT: All righty, so, thank you very much for
those announcements, guys. Other cool things

00:12:42.708 --> 00:12:48.093
coming up. Our fine friends at Wyrmwood, we have
an awesome spot to show during the break today,

00:12:48.093 --> 00:12:52.387
showing some of their awesome craftsmanship and
their partnership, showing off their products as

00:12:52.387 --> 00:12:57.084
well. There's an amazing giveaway at the mid-break
that we'll show you guys when we get there, so

00:12:57.084 --> 00:13:01.206
stick around for the mid-break when we get to that
point to see the process of what they do and how

00:13:01.206 --> 00:13:06.276
they do it and all the awesome things they produce
there. You can find their stuff, by the way, at

00:13:06.276 --> 00:13:11.867
wyrmwoodgaming.com/criticalrole for free domestic
shipping with the promo code-- Liam?

00:13:11.867 --> 00:13:13.168
LIAM: Yes!

00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:14.707
MATT: What's the promo code?

00:13:14.707 --> 00:13:21.791
LIAM: Oh. Uh, I don't have any of the shit in
front of me! Critrole? Is it Critrole now? It's

00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:23.327
Critrole again? It's back?

00:13:23.327 --> 00:13:28.351
SAM: Wyrmwood's has always been Critrole, hasn't
it?

00:13:28.351 --> 00:13:29.666
LIAM: Critrole.

00:13:29.666 --> 00:13:32.720
LAURA: It's hard to remember because it's been
such a long time since you said it.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.604
LIAM: No one told me.

00:13:34.604 --> 00:13:40.299
MATT: That's okay. Anyway, thank you very much.
Looking forward to that at the break. Also, those

00:13:40.299 --> 00:13:44.522
asking about campaign guide information, for the
Tal'dorei campaign guide. All that is up on the

00:13:44.522 --> 00:13:48.378
Green Ronin website. You can go there, go ahead
and find out when it's coming out, how to find it,

00:13:48.378 --> 00:13:56.241
all that fun stuff, and I hope you like it. Soon,
I guess. Also, we have an awesome infographic up

00:13:56.241 --> 00:14:03.280
on social media and the website, put together from
our friends at CritRoleStats, Andrew and all you

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:09.479
awesome guys. So they're awesome, go check that
out, a lot of fun trivia elements about how

00:14:09.479 --> 00:14:14.841
long we've been running the show, and apparently
how many nonexistent characters live in my brain.

00:14:14.841 --> 00:14:16.191
We're in the 500s.

00:14:16.191 --> 00:14:17.886
LIAM: It's just the tip of the iceberg, Matt.

00:14:17.886 --> 00:14:20.154
MATT: That has to be certifiable on some level.

00:14:20.154 --> 00:14:22.070
LIAM: Campaign four, I'm waiting for it.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.012
MATT: Give it time, I'm sure.

00:14:24.012 --> 00:14:27.164
SAM: Matt, that soda pop looks like you're
drinking it out of a wine glass.

00:14:27.164 --> 00:14:30.088
MATT: We are running out of receptacles for soda
pop, Sam.

00:14:30.088 --> 00:14:31.327
SAM: Okay.

00:14:31.327 --> 00:14:46.322
MATT: Also, I'm going to be at A-Kon tomorrow. Fly
out in the morning to Texas. So, looking forward

00:14:46.322 --> 00:14:48.007
to seeing you guys in Dallas.

00:14:48.007 --> 00:14:49.661
LAURA: What were you thinking?

00:14:49.661 --> 00:14:52.330
MATT: I agreed to this a long time ago! And it
all just coordinated.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.841
LIAM: Freakin' Willy Loman, man.

00:14:54.923 --> 00:14:56.578
ASHLEY: Do you at least have a late flight?

00:14:56.578 --> 00:14:57.793
MATT: No.

00:14:57.793 --> 00:14:59.302
TRAVIS: Does it start with an 'AM'?

00:14:59.302 --> 00:15:00.497
MATT: Yes.

00:15:00.497 --> 00:15:02.666
LIAM: Take a break. Run away upstate, for the
summertime.

00:15:02.666 --> 00:15:04.385
TRAVIS: Take a break! Sing it, Liam.

00:15:04.385 --> 00:15:05.698
LIAM: Take a break!

00:15:05.698 --> 00:15:07.296
MATT: Nonstop.

00:15:07.296 --> 00:15:08.711
SAM: Halfway through announcements.

00:15:08.711 --> 00:15:12.238
LAURA: Our infographic is no longer valid!

00:15:12.238 --> 00:15:17.350
MARISHA: Completely outdated, immediately.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:20.754
MATT: That's okay, it was nice while it lasted. So
see you guys at A-Kon in Dallas, Texas. Talks

00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:27.480
Machina, always live, Tuesdays, 7PM Pacific time
on Twitch and Alpha. Talk about this crazy episode

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:32.500
next week. Hosted by the fantastic Brian Wayne
Foster. Thank you for eating my cupcake. Still,

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.044
surprisingly. All right, Signal Boost, new
episode, with?

00:15:37.044 --> 00:15:41.869
MARISHA: Jeff Lewis. Everyone knows him and loves
him from the Guild. Check it out.

00:15:41.869 --> 00:15:43.558
MATT: Or as Waluigi in "There Will Be Brawl."

00:15:43.558 --> 00:15:48.579
MARISHA: Or as Waluigi. He's been so many things.
Everyone knows who Jeff Lewis is. Go watch it.

00:15:48.579 --> 00:15:53.218
MATT: There you go. And we have some other cool
announcements coming up in the coming weeks, so

00:15:53.218 --> 00:15:57.130
keep an eye out and an ear out for each episode.
We'll have a few more fun things that we can

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:01.445
announce as the month goes on. So, that, I
believe, will bring us to --

00:16:01.445 --> 00:16:07.996
LIAM: Well, I have a little thing, I just have to
share this. Friend of the show, Kiki-- not our

00:16:07.996 --> 00:16:13.026
Kiki, the other Kiki who's made so many vestiges--
brought me a little something today.

00:16:13.026 --> 00:16:18.028
(laughing)

00:16:18.028 --> 00:16:21.222
LIAM: There it is. Got to lose those. Oh yeah.

00:16:21.222 --> 00:16:24.152
LAURA: No, no, no, maybe Vax needs glasses to see
in the dark.

00:16:24.152 --> 00:16:36.551
LIAM: Maybe he does! Maybe he does. Look at my
shoulders! I'm like Travis Willingham! Is this

00:16:36.551 --> 00:16:37.904
what it feels like, Travis?

00:16:37.904 --> 00:16:40.260
TRAVIS: Yeah, I have to put them on under each
shirt. It's a real bitch.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:47.457
LIAM: Man, I've been Crossfitting all day! That's
like stitching knitwear, right?

00:16:47.457 --> 00:16:49.086
Crossfitting all day.

00:16:49.086 --> 00:16:50.704
LAURA: Ah, you're hitting me with your shoulders.

00:16:50.704 --> 00:16:52.120
LIAM: Cacaw!

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.337
LAURA: That's amazing.

00:16:53.337 --> 00:16:55.497
LIAM: Thank you, Kiki. Thank you. Oh my god.

00:16:55.497 --> 00:16:56.806
LAURA: You're phenomenal!

00:16:56.806 --> 00:17:00.871
LIAM: This will sit in my office and scare my
children. Yeah.

00:17:00.871 --> 00:17:03.997
MATT: Appreciate it, Medhiv. All right, guys. We
ready?

00:17:03.997 --> 00:17:11.408
Let's dive in now to tonight's episode of
Critical Role.

00:17:11.408 --> 00:18:40.082
[dramatic music]

00:18:40.196 --> 00:18:48.539
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So. You all right,
Jon?

00:18:48.539 --> 00:18:50.029
TALIESIN: He's jacking in.

00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:51.608
SAM: He's jacking in.

00:18:51.608 --> 00:18:58.963
MATT: And the lava's connected. Welcome back, Jon!
Glad you could join us again.

00:18:58.963 --> 00:19:01.426
(cheering)

00:19:01.426 --> 00:19:06.200
MATT: All righty. So, picking up where we left off
last time, Vox Machina had just completed their

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:12.398
adventure in the distant countryside of Wildmount,
interfacing with the Darrington family and

00:19:12.398 --> 00:19:20.043
apparently their long-acquired debt with the
Myriad, a criminal syndicate on that side of the

00:19:20.043 --> 00:19:25.471
world. After making a deal that would salvage
elements of the Darrington family, you made your

00:19:25.471 --> 00:19:34.258
way back and encountered a half-orc bardbarian by
the way of Lionel, who was there on behest of his

00:19:34.258 --> 00:19:46.286
boss, Aes Adon, or, as you were immediately
referred to as, the Meat Man. Immediately. You

00:19:46.286 --> 00:19:50.037
were brought to a nearby tavern in Whitestone
where the vicinity had been rented out entirely

00:19:50.037 --> 00:19:57.266
and you met with a large, intimidating-looking
gentleman. Scarred, pockmarked, ready to go ahead

00:19:57.266 --> 00:20:04.413
and wheel and deal some business with you. After
some interesting conversation and some sly

00:20:04.413 --> 00:20:11.825
insights by Vex'ahlia and Keyleth, it was
discovered that the Meat Man was indeed your old

00:20:11.825 --> 00:20:17.503
compatriot Scanlan under an illusion, to attempt
to notify you that he'd discovered something quite

00:20:17.503 --> 00:20:26.487
dangerous on his side of Exandria. You discovered
that this fantastic bardbarian Lionel had been

00:20:26.487 --> 00:20:32.024
working for him under his Meat Man guise in
Ank'Harel for the better part of a year, and while

00:20:32.024 --> 00:20:37.553
set on a mission with a number of other
compatriots of his, Lionel had stumbled upon an

00:20:37.553 --> 00:20:44.695
area called the Smouldercrown, a mountain range not
terribly far from Ank'harel, what seemed to

00:20:44.695 --> 00:20:48.665
be a cavern structure that led to an underground
pyramid, similar to the ziggurat that you guys had

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:53.296
been keeping an eye on underneath Whitestone,
which also contained its own small black spherical

00:20:53.296 --> 00:20:58.792
orb in which they were feeding magical items
towards, it looked like. However, they were

00:20:58.792 --> 00:21:04.135
discovered in that tunnel and Lionel was the only
one to escape with his life. The rest fell behind

00:21:04.135 --> 00:21:09.490
and were left for dead. Upon notifying Scanlan, or
the Meat Man, of this information, he knew it

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:14.781
was pertinent to return and get this to you in
person. After which, apologies were made; some

00:21:14.781 --> 00:21:19.528
were accepted, some were not. But it was generally
decided by the team that, based on this

00:21:19.528 --> 00:21:23.944
information, you needed to make your way to
Ank'Harel post-haste and discover what exactly

00:21:23.944 --> 00:21:28.788
resides beneath the mountains of the Smouldercrown.
You gathered up the following moment, well rested,

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:34.033
all met up at the base of the Sun Tree in the
center of the square, and that's where we left

00:21:34.033 --> 00:21:38.410
off. So, as you've gathered your materials, your
weapons, your armor, what you think you may need

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:44.068
for this trek, you've all gathered around the base
of the Sun Tree. Some shade has been thrown, but

00:21:44.068 --> 00:21:49.394
you have gathered. So, what do you wish to do?

00:21:49.394 --> 00:21:52.209
SAM: We've gone through the Sun Tree or not?

00:21:52.209 --> 00:21:55.736
LAURA: No, we're right outside the Sun Tree, just
before we've left Whitestone.

00:21:55.736 --> 00:22:00.891
TALIESIN: I just want to make a point that I've
alerted everybody in the government-- everybody

00:22:00.891 --> 00:22:05.754
reasonable-- where we're going, why we're going,
and that there should be people watching the

00:22:05.754 --> 00:22:09.157
Ziggurat underneath Whitestone 24/7 while we're on
this mission.

00:22:09.157 --> 00:22:11.869
Anything happens, be prepared for anything.

00:22:11.869 --> 00:22:13.450
LAURA: You're so brilliant, darling.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:19.234
MARISHA: I don't understand. There's not a lot of
shade. It's noon.

00:22:19.234 --> 00:22:22.318
TALIESIN: We've been throwing it, it's not here.

00:22:22.382 --> 00:22:24.189
LIAM: Thrown from a distance.

00:22:24.189 --> 00:22:35.130
LAURA: I think we should probably head out.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.940
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. Where in Ank'harel?

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.894
LAURA: Where are we going, Scanlan, again? Shadowy
Mountain?

00:22:42.894 --> 00:22:46.123
MARISHA: Do I know anyplace that's near?

00:22:46.123 --> 00:22:48.463
MATT: You've been to Ank'harel, you've been around
quite a bit, and you've seen a number of trees.

00:22:48.463 --> 00:22:53.559
The city itself, within the walls, through magical
means or otherwise, there is an interior oasis

00:22:53.559 --> 00:22:59.727
within the city itself. There is the sand and dust
that blows in from the outside desert that

00:22:59.727 --> 00:23:06.017
surrounds it in Marquet, but there are a number of
ponds and rivers and large palm trees and other

00:23:06.017 --> 00:23:11.342
types of trees that are risen. There are small
clusters that form almost minute forests

00:23:11.342 --> 00:23:17.043
throughout the city, whether they be a park to
wander through or a means of harvesting whatever

00:23:17.043 --> 00:23:20.762
the trees have to offer for the people that live
there. But you've seen a number of trees and it's

00:23:20.762 --> 00:23:22.186
easy enough to make your way there.

00:23:22.186 --> 00:23:24.051
MARISHA: Okay. I'll do the oasis.

00:23:24.051 --> 00:23:31.746
MATT: Okay. As Keyleth reaches out, Lionel, you
watch as the small half-elf red-headed girl

00:23:31.746 --> 00:23:35.878
reaches out and touches the tree, and suddenly the
trunk splits open at the base, and you watch as

00:23:35.878 --> 00:23:38.739
what seems to be a glowing doorway of divine
energy appears.

00:23:38.739 --> 00:23:42.056
MARISHA: Go, go! Six seconds, go! Go, go!

00:23:42.056 --> 00:23:44.950
TALIESIN: I help shove.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:50.110
SAM: I should note that Doty is coming with us as
well.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.025
LIAM: Hey, quickly!

00:23:52.025 --> 00:23:56.553
LAURA: Sure, I'll note that Trinket is coming as
well, even though it's a fucking given.

00:23:56.553 --> 00:23:58.891
LIAM: I shove my sister through the tree.

00:23:58.891 --> 00:24:00.613
TRAVIS: Warming up.

00:24:00.613 --> 00:24:03.650
LAURA: I mean, just kidding, I love you Tary.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.516
LIAM: You're not here, I just shoved you through
the tree. I made it up, I created it, right there

00:24:06.516 --> 00:24:07.923
on the fly.

00:24:07.923 --> 00:24:12.396
TRAVIS: We all go through the tree, yeah?

00:24:12.396 --> 00:24:13.802
ALL: Yeah!

00:24:13.802 --> 00:24:21.400
MATT: After an incredibly long, well-stretched six
seconds, you all eventually make your way through

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:27.787
the doorway into the center of Ank'harel. The
temperature difference is stark, it's immediate.

00:24:27.787 --> 00:24:33.124
Whereas you had a gradual transition to Ank'harel
last time you were there, going from the

00:24:33.124 --> 00:24:37.744
Whitestone colder, more damp climate to the
immediate dry heat of the central Marquet desert

00:24:37.744 --> 00:24:44.058
is just immediate, it's uncomfortable-- it may be
comfortable for some of you-- and your mouth

00:24:44.058 --> 00:24:49.790
immediately dries out for a moment, and you have
to adjust to the new atmosphere. Looking around

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:54.478
you, you've emerged from the outside of one of the
central oases, which is kind of near the Lux Run

00:24:54.478 --> 00:25:04.105
where you originally entered the city. There, you
see the streets are bustling and busy. It's

00:25:04.105 --> 00:25:10.308
starting to get closer to later in the evening
now, on this part of Exandria. You can see the

00:25:10.308 --> 00:25:15.992
sky's starting to get a little darker. There's an
element of dusk that will probably be setting in

00:25:15.992 --> 00:25:20.022
about an hour. But here you are.

00:25:20.022 --> 00:25:21.971
LAURA: Well, Scanlan?

00:25:21.971 --> 00:25:27.244
JON: Why didn't we do this before? It's so much
faster! Why did we take a 500-day journey?

00:25:27.244 --> 00:25:30.827
SAM: It was just ten days, first of all.

00:25:30.827 --> 00:25:35.482
JON: Again, I don't get days. Why don't we just
make that tree open up?

00:25:35.482 --> 00:25:41.566
SAM: I am very powerful, but there's some things
that I can't do, all right? Ever since you found

00:25:41.566 --> 00:25:44.979
out I was short, you're much snappier and snippier
with me.

00:25:44.979 --> 00:25:49.110
JON: You're just much smaller, I mean, I didn't
realize.

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:52.749
Why don't you just go back to looking like Aes?

00:25:52.749 --> 00:25:54.177
SAM: Maybe I should.

00:25:54.177 --> 00:25:55.489
TRAVIS: Maybe you should.

00:25:55.489 --> 00:26:00.274
SAM: Yeah, because I'm known around these parts,
so that would probably be better.

00:26:00.274 --> 00:26:05.353
LAURA: Does Aes wear this stupid headband? Because
it's really fucking distracting.

00:26:05.353 --> 00:26:07.553
JON: What headband?

00:26:07.553 --> 00:26:09.501
MATT: Perfect.

00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:16.345
SAM: I'll put on the hat and become the Meat Man.

00:26:16.345 --> 00:26:23.080
MATT: So you step off to the side to a point where
you're not being noticed and take on, once again,

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:29.634
the illusory facade of the Meat Man. Stepping out
into the sunlight once more, you see the imposing

00:26:29.634 --> 00:26:32.218
figure of the Meat Man now amongst you.

00:26:32.218 --> 00:26:35.464
LAURA: You're so scary and big. Do you have a
place that you always stay?

00:26:35.464 --> 00:26:38.479
SAM: I have many places.

00:26:38.479 --> 00:26:40.286
LAURA: That's what I figured.

00:26:40.286 --> 00:26:43.025
LIAM: I try sticking my fingers through the fake
head a little bit.

00:26:43.025 --> 00:26:47.347
SAM: Get off! Get off! Stop it!

00:26:47.347 --> 00:26:52.531
JON: No wonder you said hands off!

00:26:52.531 --> 00:26:54.828
LAURA: You didn't touch him this entire year?

00:26:54.828 --> 00:26:58.229
JON: He always said hands off. No matter how many
times I tried.

00:26:58.229 --> 00:27:01.815
ASHLEY: You never went to brothels or anything
like that then, I guess.

00:27:01.815 --> 00:27:03.909
TALIESIN: Probably not together.

00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:11.019
MARISHA: Have you been hugged in a year? Has
anyone given you a hug? I give him a hug.

00:27:11.019 --> 00:27:17.682
JON: Are you trying to go through me to him?

00:27:17.682 --> 00:27:20.210
MARISHA: No, I'm just giving you a hug!

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:28.840
JON: That gives me, like, 50 extra attack points
or something, right? I feel like something cool

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.358
when someone hugs me.

00:27:30.358 --> 00:27:32.694
MARISHA: Can I use my Inspiring Leader feat?

00:27:32.694 --> 00:27:34.689
MATT: If you would like to take a moment to give
everyone hugs

00:27:34.689 --> 00:27:36.606
as part of your Inspiring Leader, sure.

00:27:36.606 --> 00:27:38.060
MARISHA: You know what, guys?

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.770
SAM: Oh, she's speeching.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:48.627
MARISHA: Human contact's important, you know? So
come on, come on, let's all group hug! Group hug!

00:27:48.627 --> 00:27:51.831
TALIESIN: No! No!

00:27:51.831 --> 00:27:53.401
JON: Can I hug everybody else?

00:27:53.401 --> 00:27:56.024
SAM: The Meat Man does not hug.

00:27:56.024 --> 00:28:02.820
TRAVIS: This is a ten-minute huddle?

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:06.356
MATT: It's a ten-minute, like, hug it out.

00:28:06.356 --> 00:28:09.000
LAURA: Ten minutes is so awkward!

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.099
MATT: I know! And not in Keyleth's bailiwick at
all!

00:28:13.099 --> 00:28:16.259
TRAVIS: Are we attracting any awkward looks?

00:28:16.259 --> 00:28:20.544
LAURA: I feel like I would have abstained from the
ten-minute group hug.

00:28:20.544 --> 00:28:23.918
TALIESIN: I would have brought you into it.

00:28:23.918 --> 00:28:27.756
MARISHA: I keep trying to grab Vex. Come on! Come
on, hug it out!

00:28:27.756 --> 00:28:30.716
MATT: So, you brought Scanlan and Tary for this.

00:28:30.716 --> 00:28:31.619
SAM: Yes.

00:28:31.619 --> 00:28:32.755
MATT: Are they both?

00:28:32.755 --> 00:28:34.273
SAM: Scanlan stepped out. Tary's in.

00:28:34.273 --> 00:28:40.233
MATT: So everyone except for Scanlan gets 17
temporary hit points.

00:28:40.233 --> 00:28:45.601
LAURA: Thanks, Kiki! No, no, no, Percy brought me
in.

00:28:45.601 --> 00:28:48.987
MARISHA: Brought her out of her comfort bubble.

00:28:48.987 --> 00:28:54.542
MATT: As you all slowly begin to realize the
slight display you've given in the center of the

00:28:54.542 --> 00:28:58.042
town, especially those of you in your darker,
heavier leathers

00:28:58.042 --> 00:29:00.219
amongst this very warm, open air.

00:29:00.219 --> 00:29:03.821
LAURA: Oh, I thought we knew we were going to
Ank'harel so we dressed for it. That's what we

00:29:03.821 --> 00:29:05.068
said the last episode.

00:29:05.068 --> 00:29:06.072
MATT: Did you?

00:29:06.072 --> 00:29:10.702
LAURA: That's what &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; said, actually. You said
"you all showed up dressed for Ank'harel."

00:29:10.702 --> 00:29:12.622
LIAM: My armor is fire set.

00:29:12.622 --> 00:29:14.488
MATT: Okay, I'll trust you on that.

00:29:14.488 --> 00:29:17.280
LAURA: I feel like you said it?

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:22.201
MATT: You would've, it's fine. But it's less the
attire. You're still wearing your armor, I assume.

00:29:22.201 --> 00:29:23.295
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:29:23.295 --> 00:29:24.645
MATT: So, you're still in heavy leathers.

00:29:24.645 --> 00:29:26.896
LIAM: Yeah, we're just doing the whole Lawrence of
Arabia.

00:29:26.896 --> 00:29:30.939
MATT: So you're still a display of people in
heavy leather hugging for ten minutes in the

00:29:30.939 --> 00:29:32.598
middle of this open thoroughfare.

00:29:32.598 --> 00:29:34.878
LIAM: Yeah, we're still very awkward. At all
times.

00:29:34.878 --> 00:29:38.472
MATT: So it's not like all of a sudden there's a
crowd gathered around you. But occasionally

00:29:38.472 --> 00:29:42.908
there's a few merchants across the way that are
like, "So, anyway, as I was saying..."

00:29:42.908 --> 00:29:44.751
LIAM: Bidet!

00:29:44.751 --> 00:29:46.114
LAURA: Be pleased!

00:29:46.114 --> 00:29:47.380
MATT: "Be pleased."

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:52.065
TRAVIS: You guys are all saying it wrong. I don't
know why. Vax can pick it up, it's not that hard.

00:29:52.065 --> 00:29:53.529
LIAM: I am very smart.

00:29:53.529 --> 00:29:54.864
LAURA: Where do we go?

00:29:54.864 --> 00:29:56.390
SAM: Come with me.

00:29:56.390 --> 00:30:02.755
MATT: You watch as the Meat Man leads you down
four or five different streets, dodging through a

00:30:02.755 --> 00:30:09.398
couple of alleyways and off onto the
southern-eastern side of Ank'harel. There is a

00:30:09.398 --> 00:30:15.924
modest-looking tobacco shop that is in a poorer
district, it's a little run-down. Run-down

00:30:15.924 --> 00:30:22.911
compared to a lot of Ank'harel, which is pretty colorful
and very well-kept. So, it's pretty decent,

00:30:22.999 --> 00:30:30.118
average fare for Emon, considered the poorer side
of Ank'harel. But you-- (laughs)

00:30:30.118 --> 00:30:35.991
SAM: Was that a fart?

00:30:35.991 --> 00:30:39.014
MATT: It's one of the various beasts of burden
that you're walking past in the streets of

00:30:39.014 --> 00:30:42.040
Ank'harel. (fart sound)

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.100
LAURA: That was awesome.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.365
MATT: To be fair, sometimes the Slayer's Cakes get
a little...

00:30:46.365 --> 00:30:48.401
LIAM: They're rich.

00:30:48.401 --> 00:30:51.235
LAURA: We're working out the ingredients.

00:30:51.235 --> 00:30:59.392
MATT: Adventurers can't get it right all the time.
So you come to this modest tobacco shop. As you

00:30:59.392 --> 00:31:07.300
lead them into the interior, one of your
employees, Doran, who is a rather scrawny-looking

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:15.015
boy maybe of 22, 23, completely shaved head,
tanned skin, a little sallow, but he's sitting

00:31:15.015 --> 00:31:23.041
there, balancing a long, thin, almost like a
railroad-spike-type metal rod. He's just kind of

00:31:23.041 --> 00:31:26.451
balancing it over the wood, and as soon as the
door opens, he fumbles.

00:31:26.451 --> 00:31:31.227
"Ah. Aes. It is a pleasure to have you back."

00:31:31.227 --> 00:31:34.374
SAM: How are things in my absence?

00:31:34.374 --> 00:31:42.637
MATT: "They have been well. You've only been gone
for a few hours, but they've been uneventful."

00:31:42.637 --> 00:31:55.330
SAM: Oh, yes, yes, that's right, yes. Any new
reports of the hooded people?

00:31:55.330 --> 00:32:00.499
MATT: "None within the town, not since last-- oh,
hi, Lionel!"

00:32:00.499 --> 00:32:01.859
JON: Hey, what's up?

00:32:01.859 --> 00:32:05.047
MATT: "It's good to see you. Anyway."

00:32:05.047 --> 00:32:08.420
(laughter)

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.053
JON: You want a hug? It makes you, like,
super-strong.

00:32:11.053 --> 00:32:13.073
MATT: "Really?"

00:32:13.073 --> 00:32:15.224
JON: Yeah. At least, that's what I--

00:32:15.224 --> 00:32:16.890
SAM: No fraternizing.

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:22.101
MATT: "But anyway." And he reaches down and pulls
a small wooden lever, and it's like you see he's

00:32:22.101 --> 00:32:26.675
having to struggle with it. And as he does so, you
hear the scraping of wood, and a chain-winch

00:32:26.675 --> 00:32:33.971
going. You watch as one of the small furrows in
the back corner slowly lifts up and reveals a

00:32:33.971 --> 00:32:38.113
narrow staircase that leads down into a
subterranean area.

00:32:38.113 --> 00:32:39.821
LIAM: This is kind of cool.

00:32:39.821 --> 00:32:43.628
JON: It's really awesome. You guys should-- we
should go. This is like our cool hideout.

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:45.916
MARISHA: What was the guy's name again?

00:32:45.916 --> 00:32:47.044
MATT: Doran.

00:32:47.044 --> 00:32:48.460
MARISHA: Doran.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.976
TRAVIS: Doran, you known Aes long?

00:32:51.976 --> 00:32:55.205
MATT: "For a number of months, yes."

00:32:55.205 --> 00:32:57.393
TRAVIS: Yeah. Good guy?

00:32:57.393 --> 00:33:05.129
MATT: "We don't converse often, but he pays well,
and the work is-- the work is very rewarding."

00:33:05.129 --> 00:33:08.650
TRAVIS: Right. Does he have a firm handshake?

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:10.868
MATT: (stammers)

00:33:10.868 --> 00:33:16.572
TRAVIS: You should find out. Yeah, no, shake his
hand. No, go ahead, right now.

00:33:16.572 --> 00:33:20.661
MATT: "I do not presume to want to-- I mean,
unless you would want to?"

00:33:20.661 --> 00:33:21.872
SAM: No.

00:33:21.872 --> 00:33:23.860
MATT: "Okay, yes, I am sorry, I do not mean to--"

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:27.699
TRAVIS: In his custom, 'no' means 'yes, I crave it
deeply'.

00:33:27.699 --> 00:33:30.273
MATT: Make a deception check.

00:33:30.273 --> 00:33:33.194
TALIESIN: Your voice got really high during that.

00:33:33.194 --> 00:33:34.642
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

00:33:34.642 --> 00:33:36.567
LAURA: What'd you roll? What'd you roll?

00:33:36.567 --> 00:33:37.896
TRAVIS: 19.

00:33:37.896 --> 00:33:50.741
MATT: 19. (laughs) "Uh. I mean, if you--"

00:33:50.741 --> 00:33:54.096
TRAVIS: Known him for years. Really.

00:33:54.096 --> 00:33:57.764
SAM: I will just walk by him and go down into the
hidey-hole.

00:33:57.764 --> 00:34:04.223
MATT: Okay. "I think you have some incorrect
intel, my friend."

00:34:04.223 --> 00:34:08.858
TRAVIS: No, I think you're probably gonna need a
new job pretty soon. That was a diss. It's all

00:34:08.858 --> 00:34:11.648
right. Just look elsewhere. That's all I'm
saying.

00:34:11.648 --> 00:34:17.566
MATT: He sits back on his stool and takes his
little rod and jams it into the wood and huffs as

00:34:17.566 --> 00:34:22.409
you guys all make your way down there. Which, both
Lionel and Grog, you guys have to cannonball up

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:26.657
real tight to make it through the corridor. You
drag your way through by pulling on the little

00:34:26.657 --> 00:34:33.175
bits of wood and earth that mark the exterior
walls of this descending staircase. The smell is

00:34:33.175 --> 00:34:42.272
musty. It's not damp, but you can sense that there
is a smell of tobacco. You thought, oh, this

00:34:42.272 --> 00:34:46.372
tobacco shop's a front. As you go down, you see
about ten feet down there is a large storage room

00:34:46.372 --> 00:34:51.773
that contains barrels of dried tobacco of all
sorts, and has a very rich, pungent, but also like

00:34:51.773 --> 00:35:01.446
a nice spice scent to it in places. Spice. Ah! You
lead them on down to the far end of the hallway.

00:35:01.446 --> 00:35:05.648
There is another door that is locked. You pull out
a set of keys, unlock it, open it. It leads down

00:35:05.648 --> 00:35:11.081
another hallway, and then eventually what looks to be
some smaller sets of barracks rooms. You see a few

00:35:11.081 --> 00:35:17.795
doors that are ajar and empty with some beds
inside. You lead down another 20 or so feet to

00:35:17.795 --> 00:35:21.571
another chamber. And as it opens up, inside, you
can see there are three tables arranged in a

00:35:21.571 --> 00:35:25.419
triangular pattern, and at the far end of the
table, there is a single-- what looks like a

00:35:25.419 --> 00:35:33.223
throne-like chair. It's very well-crafted. It's
gold-leafed in places, it has intricate scrolling

00:35:33.223 --> 00:35:40.390
on the sides and where the armrests are, and there
you see an individual with a hooded cloak and a

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:47.098
deep, bluish-purple color with what looks like a
red crimson slash design around the back, a number

00:35:47.098 --> 00:35:51.834
of jewelry, and they're facing away, speaking
towards the chair, for there on the chair sits an

00:35:51.834 --> 00:36:00.437
identical large, looming human male with long,
dark hair and mustache, pockmarked skin, and is

00:36:00.437 --> 00:36:02.043
mid-conversation.

00:36:02.043 --> 00:36:05.203
LAURA: You guys really should plan this out
better.

00:36:05.203 --> 00:36:13.566
SAM: Bit of warning. Don't use her name. All
right, so I'll just walk up to them.

00:36:13.566 --> 00:36:15.128
MATT: You walk up to the two of them?

00:36:15.128 --> 00:36:16.482
SAM: Yeah, sure.

00:36:16.482 --> 00:36:21.806
MATT: All right. The cloaked figure is in the
middle of conversation, and speaking Marquesian,

00:36:21.806 --> 00:36:30.562
which you understand, to the effect of, "We've been
looking, and apparently all the shipments have

00:36:30.562 --> 00:36:34.695
"been diverted and held off until--" And hears the
footsteps and turns over and sees you. "Oh."

00:36:34.695 --> 00:36:37.429
(confused sounds)

00:36:37.429 --> 00:36:42.676
LAURA: (clears throat) Twins. Funny.

00:36:42.676 --> 00:36:45.248
LIAM: What are the odds?

00:36:45.248 --> 00:36:49.337
MATT: Deception check.

00:36:49.337 --> 00:36:54.852
LAURA: Motherfuck. Oh, you know, like 11.

00:36:54.852 --> 00:37:06.009
MATT: "I, um." Begins to pull a small blade out to
the side. "I am under the impression that perhaps

00:37:06.009 --> 00:37:13.646
"one of you is a doppelganger, and whoever my boss
is, would you please raise your hand?"

00:37:13.646 --> 00:37:16.593
SAM: I do not raise my hand.

00:37:16.593 --> 00:37:24.680
MATT: The other one does. "Aes, what do we do?"
And puts the blade forward, and you watch as the

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:32.679
other Meat Man on the throne just says, "We do
nothing. I know this man, and we will do our

00:37:32.679 --> 00:37:43.682
"business. Tell no one what you saw here, but if
two more leave, I have been taken by its will and

00:37:43.682 --> 00:37:50.138
"you'll have to kill us both. I'm just kidding,
that's a complete joke. But no, seriously, you

00:37:50.138 --> 00:37:52.259
"really-- go, go." And the--

00:37:52.259 --> 00:37:54.215
JON: Should I go kill him?

00:37:54.215 --> 00:37:55.761
SAM: No, no.

00:37:55.761 --> 00:37:57.880
MATT: The person with the cloak kind of--

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.210
JON: It's fine, I won't kill you.

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:04.963
MATT: "Thank you. Be pleased." And darts out of
the room real fast. The other Meat Man on the

00:38:04.963 --> 00:38:10.376
throne goes, "Oh, Verath, I'm gonna work real hard
to try and convince him other of that."

00:38:10.376 --> 00:38:12.249
SAM: Sorry about that.

00:38:12.249 --> 00:38:16.009
MATT: (clears throat) "It is all right."

00:38:16.009 --> 00:38:19.598
LAURA: Good to see you again.

00:38:19.598 --> 00:38:27.481
MATT: "Good to see you as well. You all look...
spry. You look alive."

00:38:27.481 --> 00:38:31.259
SAM: Is anyone in the room, now, Matt, besides--

00:38:31.259 --> 00:38:34.081
MATT: Besides you guys? No, it's just you guys and
Lionel.

00:38:34.081 --> 00:38:38.587
SAM: All right, so. We can drop all of the
illusions. They all know what's going on now.

00:38:38.587 --> 00:38:42.492
MATT: Looks earnestly at Lionel.

00:38:42.492 --> 00:38:44.578
SAM: Even Chod.

00:38:44.578 --> 00:38:47.136
JON: Lionel.

00:38:47.136 --> 00:38:51.203
MATT: "Aye, very well." And you watch as the Meat
Man on the throne suddenly diminishes into a

00:38:51.203 --> 00:38:58.040
smaller, gnome figure as well, only female, with
short, almost buzzed sides of her dark brunette

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:08.369
hair that poofs into a curl there. You can see
she's also much tanner than you remember. She is

00:39:08.369 --> 00:39:13.312
wearing what looks to be a leather tunic that's
straining against her rather large muscles for a

00:39:13.312 --> 00:39:16.234
small gnome, it looks like she's been making sure
that nobody messes

00:39:16.234 --> 00:39:17.750
with her while she's in the city.

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:18.975
LAURA: Shit. Is she buff now?

00:39:18.975 --> 00:39:20.228
MATT: She's pretty buff.

00:39:20.228 --> 00:39:21.273
LAURA: Shit.

00:39:21.273 --> 00:39:24.152
MARISHA: You got a haircut! I love it.

00:39:24.152 --> 00:39:30.823
MATT: "You know. The hot weather around here is a
bit of a bitch this time of the year, so best to

00:39:30.823 --> 00:39:34.079
"get it taken care of. Anyway. What the fuck are
you all doing here?"

00:39:34.079 --> 00:39:41.870
SAM: I went to get them to tell them about the
thing that we found.

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:44.505
MATT: "Right, okay. Great."

00:39:44.505 --> 00:39:50.259
SAM: I was going to escort them there. Do you
think you have things handled if we go for a day?

00:39:50.259 --> 00:39:53.146
MATT: "Oh, that's fine, I've only been dealing
with this for the past two and half weeks without

00:39:53.146 --> 00:39:58.974
"you just fine, no one's noticed, until you came up
inside looking the same as me. That's great!"

00:39:58.974 --> 00:40:01.707
SAM: Sorry, I didn't know you were throning.

00:40:01.707 --> 00:40:06.942
MARISHA: 'Throning'.

00:40:06.942 --> 00:40:08.354
TRAVIS: Yeah, is that a thing?

00:40:08.354 --> 00:40:10.628
SAM: Well, when we're in command, yeah.

00:40:10.628 --> 00:40:13.110
MATT: "It's not called throning, don't listen to
him."

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.900
LAURA: How long have you been here?

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:25.373
MATT: "Been here? Ank'harel? I've lost track of
time. Better part of maybe eight months, nine months?"

00:40:25.373 --> 00:40:29.664
TRAVIS: We've heard you've risen through the ranks.
Very successful, you are.

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.969
MATT: "Not too bad, if I do say so myself."

00:40:31.969 --> 00:40:33.275
TRAVIS: Well done.

00:40:33.275 --> 00:40:35.219
MATT: "This one's almost ruined us a few times."

00:40:35.219 --> 00:40:36.774
TRAVIS: That's not surprising.

00:40:36.774 --> 00:40:38.703
LIAM: How are things with the old man?

00:40:38.703 --> 00:40:43.478
MATT: "They're fine. Talks about you lot an awful
lot."

00:40:43.478 --> 00:40:44.863
LIAM: Oh, really?

00:40:44.863 --> 00:40:46.718
SAM: Not true, not true.

00:40:46.718 --> 00:40:51.763
ASHLEY: Did you have a good year together? Sort
of, I guess. That was the last time we saw you.

00:40:51.763 --> 00:40:52.969
Have things been good?

00:40:52.969 --> 00:40:56.678
MATT: She pats the side of her coin purse, which
you can see is rather thick and makes a heavy

00:40:56.678 --> 00:41:03.869
(clinking) of clinking coin. "Not been too bad, if
I say so myself. More than I ever made playing violin."

00:41:03.869 --> 00:41:05.864
TALIESIN: Profit suits you well.

00:41:05.864 --> 00:41:10.656
MARISHA: I don't know if she was referring to
monetary wealth, but sure.

00:41:10.656 --> 00:41:13.905
TRAVIS: Well, if you can't have an earnest
relationship with someone,

00:41:13.905 --> 00:41:15.545
at least she's got money.

00:41:15.545 --> 00:41:19.759
TALIESIN: It's also very hard to put an earnest
relationship in a coin purse.

00:41:19.759 --> 00:41:26.765
MATT: "Anyway. So. What can I do for you, or have
you just come by to say hi?"

00:41:26.765 --> 00:41:31.841
SAM: No, I didn't, I came to make sure you were
all right, and is everything all right? Have we

00:41:31.841 --> 00:41:34.380
heard of any other attacks or incidents?

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.683
MATT: "None yet, before you came in and rudely
interrupted my update from Verath over there, but

00:41:37.683 --> 00:41:42.563
"it seems that there hasn't been any more activity.
All the hooded ones we've seen have all absconded

00:41:42.563 --> 00:41:44.583
"over towards the mountain range again."

00:41:44.583 --> 00:41:46.071
TALIESIN: Hooded ones?

00:41:46.071 --> 00:41:54.611
SAM: Yeah, the ones in the mountain, in the cave.
What about buyers? Have we had any new interest?

00:41:54.611 --> 00:41:59.346
MATT: "No, not too bad. Carthol's been working
around the clock. I believe he's working on a new

00:41:59.346 --> 00:42:07.711
"game set. Something ivory and Issylrian in nature.
Supposed to go for a pretty penny, if we take it

00:42:07.711 --> 00:42:11.883
"across over up on Wildmount, but it'll take a
little longer to make it. You know, one-man job.

00:42:11.883 --> 00:42:13.633
"He's good. He's not that good."

00:42:13.633 --> 00:42:18.269
SAM: Just remind him to put some imperfections in
it. He always likes to make things too beautiful.

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:19.584
MATT: "I will, I will."

00:42:19.584 --> 00:42:22.107
LAURA: Why don't you want to sell beautiful
things?

00:42:22.107 --> 00:42:27.320
SAM: We want to sell real things, not things that
look like they're brand-new. If things are really

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:30.086
old, they have dents and scuffs on them.

00:42:30.086 --> 00:42:32.750
JON: Wait, so you're lying again.

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:37.695
MATT: "Modifying the presentation."

00:42:37.695 --> 00:42:40.937
JON: I don't know who to trust anymore.

00:42:40.937 --> 00:42:43.168
SAM: You should trust me because I pay you.

00:42:43.168 --> 00:42:45.890
MATT: "I don't know. Looks like he might be
growing up."

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:49.222
(laughter)

00:42:49.222 --> 00:42:51.545
JON: I have been eating more.

00:42:51.545 --> 00:42:55.668
MATT: "Oh, I can tell that." (laughs) She sets off
the throne and comes up and leaps and smacks you

00:42:55.668 --> 00:42:59.287
on the shoulder. Pretty good hit.

00:42:59.287 --> 00:43:01.724
JON: That's awesome!

00:43:01.724 --> 00:43:05.880
MATT: "I know. Anyway."

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:10.017
SAM: All right, so we'll be gone-- we've rested
recently, right?

00:43:10.017 --> 00:43:11.721
MATT: Yeah, the night before.

00:43:11.721 --> 00:43:18.192
SAM: So we'll be going for a while, and just hold
down the fort while we're gone. Also, I know it

00:43:18.192 --> 00:43:26.453
sounds stupid, but can you look into getting a few
ducks? Just as pets?

00:43:26.453 --> 00:43:29.456
MATT: "Sure."

00:43:29.456 --> 00:43:33.661
SAM: Yeah, I know. It's just a thank-you.

00:43:33.661 --> 00:43:35.305
MATT: "Ducks."

00:43:35.305 --> 00:43:36.919
SAM: Yes.

00:43:36.919 --> 00:43:39.386
JON: They have awesome information.

00:43:39.386 --> 00:43:47.956
MATT: "Right, okay. Ducks it is. I'll get right to
it. I'll talk to my duck distributor."

00:43:47.956 --> 00:43:52.696
SAM: Just ask, just ask us and that would be fine,
too.

00:43:52.696 --> 00:43:55.450
JON: Yeah, but ducks will know things that you
don't!

00:43:55.450 --> 00:44:01.621
MATT: "I'll send some word to the Fowl District of
Ank'harel to provide the proper--"

00:44:01.621 --> 00:44:03.643
MARISHA: There's a fowl district?

00:44:03.643 --> 00:44:07.039
MATT: "No, there's not a fowl district! I'm
fucking with you."

00:44:07.039 --> 00:44:12.635
SAM: You should always assume she's fucking with
you. Every time.

00:44:12.635 --> 00:44:15.846
MATT: "You traveled with this one long enough.
Figure it out."

00:44:15.846 --> 00:44:17.881
LIAM: Wonder where she gets it from?

00:44:17.881 --> 00:44:20.625
MATT: "Don't you say a goddamn thing or I'll cut
your tongue out."

00:44:20.625 --> 00:44:22.156
LIAM: Promises, promises.

00:44:22.156 --> 00:44:30.318
MATT: "All right. Go about your business. I've got
it here. Don't die. Any of you. Especially you.

00:44:30.318 --> 00:44:33.502
"I've got ducks coming for you, don't know what to
do if you don't show up back here to pick 'em up."

00:44:33.502 --> 00:44:34.699
JON: I won't die.

00:44:34.699 --> 00:44:36.177
MATT: "Good. Don't."

00:44:36.177 --> 00:44:38.951
SAM: If he does, we'll just eat the ducks.

00:44:38.951 --> 00:44:41.974
MATT: "I don't care, then. Ducks are pretty
tasty."

00:44:41.974 --> 00:44:44.191
JON: They'll tell you where to bury me.

00:44:44.191 --> 00:44:47.128
(laughter)

00:44:47.128 --> 00:44:48.697
JON: They know all the proper spots.

00:44:48.697 --> 00:44:51.953
SAM: Sure. Okay.

00:44:51.953 --> 00:44:58.637
MATT: "All right, then, shoo. Night's about to
come. You can travel over the cool evening air."

00:44:58.637 --> 00:45:03.005
SAM: Do any of you need any supplies or anything
before we go? Are we good to travel on foot?"

00:45:03.005 --> 00:45:05.747
LAURA: What kind of potions you got available?
Healing potions?

00:45:05.747 --> 00:45:11.967
SAM: Healing potions? I can heal with my words.
Why would I need healing potions?

00:45:11.967 --> 00:45:13.624
LAURA: Just in case you run away.

00:45:13.624 --> 00:45:14.926
LIAM: Is that a no?

00:45:14.926 --> 00:45:22.672
ASHLEY: Just in case you decide to leave again,
which is probably highly probable. I don't know.

00:45:22.672 --> 00:45:23.934
Just in case.

00:45:23.934 --> 00:45:33.037
SAM: No, I don't have any of those. But it can be
arranged if you are short. I can have my second

00:45:33.037 --> 00:45:34.752
here look into it for you.

00:45:34.752 --> 00:45:42.557
LAURA: I have three regular healing potions and
that's it.

00:45:42.557 --> 00:45:44.199
TALIESIN: Cleared out.

00:45:44.199 --> 00:45:46.799
LAURA: I think we're pretty much out.

00:45:46.799 --> 00:45:49.791
SAM: Crutch, will you--

00:45:49.791 --> 00:45:51.672
JON: I have 375 grams.

00:45:51.672 --> 00:45:52.952
SAM: That's gold.

00:45:52.952 --> 00:45:55.578
LAURA: You have 375 grams?

00:45:55.578 --> 00:45:56.890
JON: Gold, I guess.

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:58.230
LAURA: Grams of gold?

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:02.990
JON: They look the same. But I can buy lots of
potions with that, right?

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:10.896
SAM: No, you cannot buy any. But the Crutch here
will look into it while we're gone. We won't have

00:46:10.896 --> 00:46:12.918
any until we get back, though.

00:46:12.918 --> 00:46:17.507
TRAVIS: He calls you the Crutch?

00:46:17.507 --> 00:46:22.266
MATT: "The Crutch is my work name. It's what the
Meat Man calls me 'cause of my height."

00:46:22.266 --> 00:46:25.941
LAURA: Oh. I see.

00:46:25.941 --> 00:46:35.523
TALIESIN: So it's a name for when he's ribbing
you. Ribbing. I'm just so excited by all the puns

00:46:35.523 --> 00:46:37.105
that are available.

00:46:37.105 --> 00:46:42.036
LAURA: So no healing, then? Let's just go?

00:46:42.036 --> 00:46:43.842
SAM: No, we have to just go.

00:46:43.842 --> 00:46:49.732
MATT: "Hold on, hold on." She walks over and
starts rummaging through a few small crates that

00:46:49.732 --> 00:46:54.563
are to the side. She's like, "These haven't been
organized properly." Grabs a little crowbar and

00:46:54.563 --> 00:46:59.634
wedges it in. Pops off the top, starts rummaging
through, tossing various things out the side like

00:46:59.634 --> 00:47:07.327
small metal cups roll across the ground, come to a
stop. Pulls out a small, looks like a leather

00:47:07.327 --> 00:47:14.537
satchel of some kind that's wrapped over the top
and the side with twine. Unwraps it. "There's a

00:47:14.537 --> 00:47:27.446
"few something for you." Sets it down. Pulls a
necklace off. "You're borrowing this, but you're

00:47:27.446 --> 00:47:29.411
"bringing it back when you're done."

00:47:29.411 --> 00:47:31.625
SAM: Of course.

00:47:31.625 --> 00:47:34.832
MATT: "All right. Now, which one of you but him
wants it?"

00:47:34.832 --> 00:47:36.209
JON: Oh, I do, I do!

00:47:36.209 --> 00:47:37.899
MATT: "Okay." Throws it to you.

00:47:37.899 --> 00:47:40.329
JON: It's really cool-looking.

00:47:40.329 --> 00:47:48.093
MATT: It's a heavy, somewhat tarnished silver
chain that smells of old ale-stained wood.

00:47:48.093 --> 00:47:50.109
JON: Oh, I don't like it, someone else take it.

00:47:50.109 --> 00:47:52.456
LAURA: No, no, no, I called it.

00:47:52.456 --> 00:47:55.753
LIAM: Give it to me, give it to me, I called it as
well! Dad, make us roll for it.

00:47:55.753 --> 00:47:57.848
JON: Why don't you guys just cut it in half?

00:47:57.848 --> 00:47:59.312
LAURA: Tickle-tickle-tickle!

00:47:59.312 --> 00:48:01.421
MATT: Both of you guys make strength checks.

00:48:01.421 --> 00:48:05.160
LAURA: But I don't wanna break it! Don't pull so
hard that you break it!

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:11.536
LIAM: Why would I do that? I have so much finesse.
That's cocked. It was cocked, you say cocked

00:48:11.536 --> 00:48:14.212
eighty thousand times, and now I'm gonna use Luck,
because I wanna beat you.

00:48:14.212 --> 00:48:15.776
LAURA: You motherfuck!

00:48:15.776 --> 00:48:17.692
LIAM: Oh, it's the same thing! So what is this,
strength?

00:48:17.692 --> 00:48:19.242
MATT: Strength, add the strength modifier.

00:48:19.242 --> 00:48:20.568
LIAM: I will.

00:48:20.568 --> 00:48:21.766
LAURA: Oh, no.

00:48:21.766 --> 00:48:23.112
LIAM: You go first.

00:48:23.112 --> 00:48:23.958
LAURA: Nine.

00:48:23.958 --> 00:48:25.062
LIAM: Oh, she beat me!

00:48:25.062 --> 00:48:26.808
(laughter)

00:48:26.808 --> 00:48:28.313
MATT: You rip the chain from his grip.

00:48:28.313 --> 00:48:32.284
LAURA: What did I get? What is it?

00:48:32.284 --> 00:48:34.450
MATT: "It's an Amulet of the Drunkard."

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:36.435
LAURA: What's that mean?

00:48:36.435 --> 00:48:40.450
MATT: "You wear that, you drink yourself some fine,
fine alcohol, might heal you a bit."

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:46.453
LAURA: Do you already wear a necklace? I already
wear a necklace, so I probably can't wear it, huh?

00:48:46.453 --> 00:48:51.731
You can get up. It's okay, you can go. You've got
30 feet!

00:48:51.731 --> 00:48:53.760
SAM: Jack off, jack off, jack off!

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.563
MATT: The umbilical! There you go.

00:48:56.563 --> 00:48:58.273
MARISHA: You're good, you're good.

00:48:58.273 --> 00:49:04.670
TALIESIN: It turns spirits into potions. That's
pretty solid.

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:10.296
TRAVIS: Beer, ale, mead, or wine will cause you to
regain 2d4 + 2 hit points.

00:49:10.296 --> 00:49:13.855
LAURA: Oh jeez, that's so cool. Do you already
wear a necklace, Grog?

00:49:13.855 --> 00:49:16.630
Do you have to attune to it?

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:21.420
MATT: It is not attuned. But there is a limit to
it, if you read it.

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:23.853
TRAVIS: Yeah, you can only once until the next
dawn.

00:49:23.853 --> 00:49:27.049
MATT: So once a day, you can just drink a pint of
some alcoholic drink, and it'll heal you like a

00:49:27.049 --> 00:49:28.461
basic healing potion.

00:49:28.461 --> 00:49:29.720
TRAVIS: Fucking awesome.

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.893
MARISHA: Who was out of healing potions?

00:49:31.893 --> 00:49:33.077
TALIESIN: I'm out.

00:49:33.077 --> 00:49:36.190
LAURA: I've got three for the party, it's not for
me. I have none for myself.

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:41.192
SAM: I know I've been rather quiet this journey,
but I could just provide us with a few more, if

00:49:41.192 --> 00:49:42.595
that would help things--

00:49:42.595 --> 00:49:44.997
TRAVIS: Tary, that is very considerate of you,
yeah.

00:49:44.997 --> 00:49:46.444
JON: Is this Taryon?

00:49:46.444 --> 00:49:54.404
SAM: Yeah, sorry, it's odd for me. I will rip off
my last remaining potion patch on the robe, which

00:49:54.404 --> 00:49:56.694
has four small healing potions.

00:49:56.694 --> 00:50:02.806
MATT: There you go, so you have-- and the satchel
that you received from the Crutch has three more

00:50:02.806 --> 00:50:04.204
additional regular healing potions.

00:50:04.204 --> 00:50:07.193
SAM: So we have seven regular healing potions.

00:50:07.193 --> 00:50:10.064
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. So everybody take one?

00:50:10.064 --> 00:50:11.644
MARISHA: I have four on me.

00:50:11.644 --> 00:50:13.484
LAURA: Oh, jeez. Everybody but Keyleth take one?

00:50:13.484 --> 00:50:17.198
MARISHA: I made a few over the break, if we want
them.

00:50:17.198 --> 00:50:20.731
TALIESIN: Well, as long as I've gone one in
there.

00:50:20.731 --> 00:50:22.541
MARISHA: I'm gonna hand another one to Percy.

00:50:22.541 --> 00:50:23.718
TALIESIN: I'll take two.

00:50:23.718 --> 00:50:26.466
LIAM: Hey, T., are you feeling sentimental, being
back in Marquet?

00:50:26.466 --> 00:50:32.279
SAM: The weather is certainly dry.

00:50:32.279 --> 00:50:33.788
LIAM: You've come full circle.

00:50:33.788 --> 00:50:41.766
SAM: Yes. I certainly have. It's good to be back,
but I'm a little nervous.

00:50:41.766 --> 00:50:43.563
I don't know why, really.

00:50:43.563 --> 00:50:45.644
LIAM: New setting.

00:50:45.644 --> 00:50:48.064
SAM: Yes. New dynamic.

00:50:48.064 --> 00:50:50.566
TRAVIS: Your hair's holding up well in the heat,
though.

00:50:50.566 --> 00:50:53.961
SAM: Only because it's under the Helm. Believe me,
it's a nightmare in there if you look underneath.

00:50:53.961 --> 00:50:56.686
ASHLEY: I'm sure you look beautiful.

00:50:56.686 --> 00:50:58.576
LIAM: Does it retain the shape of the helmet?

00:50:58.576 --> 00:51:02.298
SAM: Unfortunately, yes.

00:51:02.298 --> 00:51:04.660
(laughter)

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:12.101
LAURA: I'm just holding this necklace. I have a
necklace on, I can't wear it.

00:51:12.101 --> 00:51:14.571
JON: I thought you were giving it to him.

00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:16.467
LAURA: Can you wear it?

00:51:16.467 --> 00:51:18.460
JON: To Gog over there.

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:21.019
LIAM: No, I'm not wearing a necklace.

00:51:21.019 --> 00:51:25.085
LAURA: Well then, let me give it to you.

00:51:25.085 --> 00:51:27.255
LIAM: I didn't actually want it. I just wanted to
best you.

00:51:27.255 --> 00:51:28.541
LAURA: Well, now you have it.

00:51:28.541 --> 00:51:29.838
TALIESIN: You can actually use it, though.

00:51:29.838 --> 00:51:31.151
LIAM: Can I have the thingie?

00:51:31.151 --> 00:51:32.739
TRAVIS: You're not giving it to me?

00:51:32.739 --> 00:51:34.938
LAURA: I thought you said you already wore a
necklace!

00:51:34.938 --> 00:51:40.314
TRAVIS: No. No! I mean, I wear, like, ears and
fingers and toes around my neck, but you can

00:51:40.314 --> 00:51:46.208
always accessorize some more, fuck, shit! I'm the
only one that walks around with alcohol on me all

00:51:46.208 --> 00:51:47.559
the time, anyway.

00:51:47.559 --> 00:51:53.475
MARISHA: So wait, can he combo-use that and be
like fine wine and chug it?

00:51:53.475 --> 00:51:58.201
MATT: Any relatively alcoholic drink labeled on
the thing, he can drink a pint of.

00:51:58.201 --> 00:52:05.150
LIAM: A pint, though, Grog? A pint? You'd snort
that up your left nostril, right?

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:09.498
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's like a little traveler's bottle
of soap.

00:52:09.498 --> 00:52:12.302
LIAM: Yeah, that's like you sneezing into a
bottle.

00:52:12.302 --> 00:52:17.721
JON: Do you have an extra necklace that turns
chocolate milk into, like, healing?

00:52:17.721 --> 00:52:21.388
MATT: "I'll put the word out for you. See what we
can find."

00:52:21.388 --> 00:52:24.373
LAURA: Are we heading out immediately?

00:52:24.373 --> 00:52:26.037
SAM: There's nothing to wait for.

00:52:26.037 --> 00:52:28.599
MARISHA: I actually do have a necklace. I have an
old necklace.

00:52:28.599 --> 00:52:30.266
SAM: What are we talking about now?

00:52:30.266 --> 00:52:36.806
JON: Everybody went from no potions to, well, I've
got this, I've got this.

00:52:36.806 --> 00:52:41.803
LAURA: I don't know why I asked for potions when
we had four fucking potions.

00:52:41.803 --> 00:52:44.071
TALIESIN: It might be that thing that I got rid
of.

00:52:44.071 --> 00:52:48.751
MARISHA: I had an old card that was the necklace
that gave +1 to attack and damage while--

00:52:48.751 --> 00:52:54.467
SAM: That's an attunement item. We don't need that
shit. Let's go.

00:52:54.467 --> 00:53:01.487
MARISHA: All right. Sorry your employer overruled
me, Kord. Or Card. Or Chode.

00:53:01.487 --> 00:53:02.604
LAURA: Lionel.

00:53:02.604 --> 00:53:10.483
MATT: "All right. Please. Out of my space." And
you watch as her form shifts back to that of Aes

00:53:10.483 --> 00:53:11.841
Adan, the Meat Man.

00:53:11.841 --> 00:53:13.321
TRAVIS: That's impressive.

00:53:13.321 --> 00:53:17.149
MATT: "Thank you. Treat that well. If you lose it,
I'm making you pay for it!"

00:53:17.149 --> 00:53:18.747
TRAVIS: Oh, no, it's in good hands.

00:53:18.747 --> 00:53:22.131
MATT: "All right, then. Good luck! Don't die."

00:53:22.131 --> 00:53:24.236
LAURA: The Crutch.

00:53:24.236 --> 00:53:28.153
MATT: "I'm the Meat Man now."

00:53:28.153 --> 00:53:30.925
TRAVIS: Yeah, she changed back.

00:53:30.925 --> 00:53:33.633
LAURA: Sorry, I was looking at necklaces.

00:53:33.633 --> 00:53:35.816
SAM: All right. On we go.

00:53:35.816 --> 00:53:39.509
TRAVIS: Yeah. We head back out the cramped little
tunnel.

00:53:39.509 --> 00:53:45.005
MATT: All right. Make your way back up through the
tobacco shop to the streets of Ank'harel. You are

00:53:45.005 --> 00:53:49.919
aware that the Smouldercrown mountain range is
about 290 miles

00:53:49.919 --> 00:53:51.785
southeast of Ank'harel across the desert.

00:53:51.785 --> 00:54:01.713
JON: You guys, it's gonna be a really long hike,
so let's find another burning tree, or Sun Tree or

00:54:01.713 --> 00:54:06.138
something that we can just walk into. 'Cause that
was way easier than traveling.

00:54:06.138 --> 00:54:07.684
TALIESIN: Misty Step.

00:54:07.684 --> 00:54:11.544
LAURA: Not Misty Step. Wind Walk.

00:54:11.544 --> 00:54:14.196
TRAVIS: You can do the tree thing too?

00:54:14.196 --> 00:54:17.654
JON: No, I've never seen that. I can show you how
to get there, but it seems--

00:54:17.654 --> 00:54:19.453
TRAVIS: Have you ever tried?

00:54:19.453 --> 00:54:22.368
JON: Tried through the Sun Tree? What do I do? Do
I just--

00:54:22.368 --> 00:54:25.390
LAURA: You have to ask him.

00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:28.294
JON: I'm good at-- okay.

00:54:28.294 --> 00:54:29.954
LIAM: Absolute conviction.

00:54:29.954 --> 00:54:31.823
JON: So I go over to the nearest tree.

00:54:31.823 --> 00:54:33.975
MATT: Okay. About maybe one block up, there's--

00:54:33.975 --> 00:54:35.282
JON: About one block, guys, come on. Leading the
way.

00:54:35.282 --> 00:54:37.423
MATT: All right. Solid trunk palm.

00:54:37.423 --> 00:54:43.143
MARISHA: He likes it when you're super chill and
casual with him, so be cool.

00:54:43.143 --> 00:54:45.495
JON: He? So the trees are like dudes?

00:54:45.495 --> 00:54:47.135
LAURA: All of them?

00:54:47.135 --> 00:54:50.464
MARISHA: (mouths) Just go with it.

00:54:50.464 --> 00:54:53.544
JON: He likes it when you're what?

00:54:53.544 --> 00:54:55.235
TALIESIN: Chill and casual.

00:54:55.235 --> 00:55:07.407
JON: Oh. Okay. So I go up to the tree. Do I touch
it? You're the tree. Hey, can you open up and take

00:55:07.407 --> 00:55:17.024
us to Crown-- what was it? Smouldercrown entrance,
just 'cause. Wait, it would be way easier to just

00:55:17.024 --> 00:55:18.556
go straight to the pyramid.

00:55:18.556 --> 00:55:21.568
LIAM: Yeah, but it's more like a stroking thing.
You don't just leave your hand in place.

00:55:21.568 --> 00:55:29.288
JON: Okay, so hey, I'm chill. Can you just take
us? Be cool?

00:55:29.288 --> 00:55:34.332
TRAVIS: The bark's a little dry. Maybe it needs a
little moisture. There you go.

00:55:34.332 --> 00:55:38.173
SAM: (screams)

00:55:38.173 --> 00:55:48.000
JON: So yeah, it's cool, we're cool, if you want
to take us there. If not, we get it. Is that

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.153
pretty chill?

00:55:49.153 --> 00:55:50.841
MARISHA: That's pretty chill, yeah.

00:55:50.841 --> 00:55:53.417
LAURA: I'm surprised it's not working, honestly.
That's the most chill I've ever seen.

00:55:53.417 --> 00:55:54.957
SAM: Why am I playing the tree?

00:55:54.957 --> 00:55:56.437
JON: Are you guys--

00:55:56.437 --> 00:56:03.367
MARISHA: You know that intimate hug we had
earlier? Kinda do that.

00:56:03.367 --> 00:56:07.564
JON: Aes? Now I'm talking to Aes.

00:56:07.564 --> 00:56:09.130
SAM: Oh, okay. Yes.

00:56:09.130 --> 00:56:16.086
JON: This reminds me of times when I was a kid and
kids would-- are they making fun of me?

00:56:16.086 --> 00:56:18.340
SAM: They are definitely making fun of you.

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:19.526
JON: Oh, come on!

00:56:19.526 --> 00:56:22.193
LIAM: What're you telling him lies for?

00:56:22.193 --> 00:56:23.990
TALIESIN: We do this to everybody. It's all
right.

00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:25.182
JON: You do?

00:56:25.182 --> 00:56:27.109
MARISHA: It's part of the initiation.

00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:28.752
TALIESIN: But yes, we are making fun of you.

00:56:28.752 --> 00:56:32.158
JON: Sorry, tree. Wait, are the trees really
alive?

00:56:32.158 --> 00:56:33.338
LAURA: No, they are.

00:56:33.338 --> 00:56:36.512
JON: Okay, sorry, tree. But that was kinda fun,
stroking it.

00:56:36.512 --> 00:56:38.537
MARISHA: The tree appreciates it.

00:56:38.537 --> 00:56:42.295
JON: Anyways, why don't you guys just do the Sun
Tree thing?

00:56:42.295 --> 00:56:47.570
SAM: We can't really do that. We need to know
where the tree is

00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:49.956
that we're going to be going to.

00:56:49.956 --> 00:56:52.538
LIAM: There's a lot of tree science involved.

00:56:52.538 --> 00:56:56.184
MARISHA: If you could maybe potentially help me,
Meat Man.

00:56:56.184 --> 00:56:59.673
SAM: I haven't been there, have I?

00:56:59.673 --> 00:57:02.692
MATT: You haven't been to Smouldercrown, no.

00:57:02.692 --> 00:57:05.818
MARISHA: Why were you just talking like the Meat
Man?

00:57:05.818 --> 00:57:11.158
SAM: I have not been to the place we are going. I
do not know of any tree.

00:57:11.158 --> 00:57:13.075
MATT: Yeah, the only one who's been there is
Lionel.

00:57:13.075 --> 00:57:14.290
MARISHA: You've been there.

00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:17.179
JON: Yeah, I'm the one who saw it and told you
guys about it.

00:57:17.179 --> 00:57:18.271
MARISHA: Were there trees?

00:57:18.271 --> 00:57:22.545
JON: Yeah, there were a couple dead-looking trees,
not huge ones. How big do they have to be?

00:57:22.545 --> 00:57:23.892
MARISHA: They looked dead?

00:57:23.892 --> 00:57:25.563
JON: They looked a little dead-ish.

00:57:25.563 --> 00:57:28.024
MARISHA: They were dead? Like very dead?

00:57:28.024 --> 00:57:29.904
JON: Do they have to be alive?

00:57:29.904 --> 00:57:34.423
MARISHA: I think so? Right?

00:57:34.423 --> 00:57:36.692
JON: I really wanted to see that Sun Tree thing.

00:57:36.692 --> 00:57:38.410
TRAVIS: We'll use it to go back.

00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:40.580
MARISHA: Would you prefer to be a cloud?

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:42.433
JON: I can be a cloud?

00:57:42.433 --> 00:57:46.095
MARISHA: I could be a cloud, but I'm gonna blow a
7th-level spell for it.

00:57:46.095 --> 00:57:48.479
LAURA: Wait, but how many people can you do,
because we also have Doty.

00:57:48.479 --> 00:57:52.387
MARISHA: Ten? Let me see.

00:57:52.387 --> 00:57:58.482
LIAM: Can you turn an automaton, a robit, into
cloud? Did we do that already?

00:57:58.482 --> 00:58:00.639
SAM: Not too many. We're ten exactly.

00:58:00.639 --> 00:58:01.899
TRAVIS: Really?

00:58:01.899 --> 00:58:03.357
LAURA: Yeah, Trinket's in the necklace.

00:58:03.357 --> 00:58:05.397
TRAVIS: Doty, Taryon, Scanlan.

00:58:05.397 --> 00:58:07.047
LAURA: Oh, shit. Taryon and Scanlan.

00:58:07.047 --> 00:58:08.794
SAM: That's ten, isn't it?

00:58:08.794 --> 00:58:16.746
ASHLEY: But that's blowing a 7th-level spell. How
long does it take to hike up there?

00:58:16.746 --> 00:58:18.258
SAM: 290 miles.

00:58:18.258 --> 00:58:21.673
MATT: Wind Walk is a 6th-level spell. Not a 7th.

00:58:21.673 --> 00:58:26.689
MARISHA: But I've already used my 6th-level spell
to Transport Via Plants. That's what I'm saying.

00:58:26.689 --> 00:58:29.302
So I'm gonna have to use a 7th-level spell to do
it.

00:58:29.302 --> 00:58:30.754
MATT: This is true.

00:58:30.754 --> 00:58:32.095
TRAVIS: It's worth it.

00:58:32.095 --> 00:58:33.956
LIAM: Does that work on Doty?

00:58:33.956 --> 00:58:37.029
MATT: So you'd be able to get all of you.

00:58:37.029 --> 00:58:39.095
TALIESIN: Would it work on Doty?

00:58:39.095 --> 00:58:46.769
MATT: Willing creatures. Technically he's
considered a creature for the targeting reason of

00:58:46.769 --> 00:58:48.095
spells and effects, so yeah.

00:58:48.095 --> 00:58:49.585
LIAM: Tary.

00:58:49.585 --> 00:58:58.787
MARISHA: So we can do that, but then we might
wanna rest. Or we can do some scouting, take a

00:58:58.787 --> 00:59:01.714
look. I won't be completely tapped out.

00:59:01.714 --> 00:59:03.864
LIAM: We can camp it up if we need to.

00:59:03.864 --> 00:59:08.148
TALIESIN: It'll take more than a day to get there
anyway, so this way we'll just save some time and

00:59:08.148 --> 00:59:10.675
we'll take a day to take a look around.

00:59:10.675 --> 00:59:12.669
LAURA: Let's go!

00:59:12.669 --> 00:59:17.024
LIAM: Lionel, this is really awesome. For real,
you're going to like this.

00:59:17.024 --> 00:59:19.478
MARISHA: Ready? Ready? Everybody join hands, join
hands, join hands.

00:59:19.478 --> 00:59:20.961
LAURA: Do we have to join hands for this?

00:59:20.961 --> 00:59:22.646
SAM: We don't at all. Not at all.

00:59:22.646 --> 00:59:24.285
JON: Can we still do it?

00:59:24.285 --> 00:59:26.902
MARISHA: Poof!

00:59:26.902 --> 00:59:31.435
MATT: All right, you guys feel a warm, magical
effect go through you. As you're concentrating,

00:59:31.435 --> 00:59:36.754
consider yourself being a cloud, you are the
cloud. You open your eyes, Lionel, and you look,

00:59:36.754 --> 00:59:40.240
and you are a fucking cloud! You're like 20 feet
up!

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.896
JON: Oh, check this out! (spits)

00:59:42.896 --> 00:59:47.713
MATT: As you do that, you watch as more cloud spit
goes (fft) and just more cloud. Your body is

00:59:47.713 --> 00:59:50.575
moisture. When you try and talk, it just goes
(exhale).

00:59:50.575 --> 00:59:53.621
JON: So you can't really talk.

00:59:53.621 --> 01:00:00.627
MATT: Can't really talk. You're a cloud. So if you
wanted to, you could spend a minute to concentrate

01:00:00.627 --> 01:00:04.419
and revert back, and you can do that-- you have an
eight-hour period where

01:00:04.419 --> 01:00:05.935
you can just turn back and forth.

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:10.457
LAURA: We should probably concentrate for just a
minute. I'm gonna turn back, just so I can shout

01:00:10.457 --> 01:00:16.666
out, we should all follow-- you know how to get
there, right, Lionel?

01:00:16.666 --> 01:00:20.088
JON: (wind noises)

01:00:20.088 --> 01:00:29.619
LAURA: Bob up and down if it's a yes. Okay. We're
going to follow you, all right? And when it's

01:00:29.619 --> 01:00:36.087
ready to land, then just hover down, and we'll all
follow your lead.

01:00:36.087 --> 01:00:38.458
JON: (fart sound)

01:00:38.458 --> 01:00:41.763
(laughter)

01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:45.389
LAURA: That's totally normal. We all do it. All
right.

01:00:45.389 --> 01:00:50.905
MATT: All right. So you all go into your mist
forms and begin to follow after Lionel's lead. As

01:00:50.905 --> 01:00:56.740
you guys coast over the upper areas of Ank'harel,
it's a beautiful view looking down at this

01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:03.315
gorgeous city, just this glittering jewel of color
and architecture, one of the older cities in

01:01:03.315 --> 01:01:11.967
Exandria that portions of it seem to have survived
elements of the Age of Arcanum and the Calamity,

01:01:11.967 --> 01:01:19.340
and one of the first societies to spring up
thereafter. And it's beautiful to see this

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:23.898
history, far longer than that of Tal'Dorei, or at
least the human societies of Tal'Dorei, just

01:01:23.898 --> 01:01:30.420
standing obstinate against the dark oppression of
the surrounding desert. You continue to head in

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:33.049
that direction, with you leading. Lionel, I need
you to roll a survival check.

01:01:33.049 --> 01:01:38.619
LAURA: Survival check. We might get lost?

01:01:38.619 --> 01:01:40.769
TALIESIN: Add that to your survival.

01:01:40.769 --> 01:01:43.317
JON: 14.

01:01:43.317 --> 01:01:50.124
MATT: 14. All right. So you're traveling at an
incredible speed. Like you're used to walking

01:01:50.124 --> 01:01:56.567
speed, running speed sometimes, maybe horsey
speed. This is a very, very fast speed. You're

01:01:56.567 --> 01:02:03.502
coasting through the air right as the sun begins
to set, and the night begins to hit. You keep

01:02:03.502 --> 01:02:08.575
relatively low to the ground, so you have your
Darkvision to see the topography and get an idea

01:02:08.575 --> 01:02:12.575
of where it's going and the direction. You can
look up and see the stars above. You've traveled,

01:02:12.575 --> 01:02:15.423
and you've been amongst this desert most of your
life, so you have a good sense of how to follow

01:02:15.423 --> 01:02:19.913
that, and because of that, you're able to maintain
your directional position towards the

01:02:19.913 --> 01:02:24.295
Smouldercrown Mountains. You push on. About
halfway through the journey, you can see some

01:02:24.295 --> 01:02:28.429
little flames occasionally in the distance, what
looks to be either caravan camps or bandit camps

01:02:28.429 --> 01:02:33.036
or various nomad circles that are set up for the
night where different campfires are placed,

01:02:33.036 --> 01:02:37.927
whether it's beacons, traps, or just people to
stay warm for the evening. You know, best not to

01:02:37.927 --> 01:02:42.787
stop whenever you see a flame in the middle of the
desert. The winds are picking up and getting

01:02:42.787 --> 01:02:47.693
colder, the stark contrast between the temperature
of the day and the night here is immense, and your

01:02:47.693 --> 01:02:52.688
moisture form takes on the cold fairly quickly,
and you feel, even though you're in this form, the

01:02:52.688 --> 01:02:56.415
chill still captures you a bit as your
condensation begins to slightly crystallize in

01:02:56.415 --> 01:02:59.201
places, but you push on. Roll one more survival
check, please.

01:02:59.201 --> 01:03:02.297
LAURA: Don't get us lost!

01:03:02.297 --> 01:03:04.166
JON: 15.

01:03:04.166 --> 01:03:11.619
MATT: 15. And without an issue or any sort of a
loss of step or position, eventually you watch as

01:03:11.619 --> 01:03:17.970
the ominous spire-like jagged dagger-topped
Smouldercrown Mountains begin to break the horizon

01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:23.585
and make their way towards you. You're now, at
that speed, it hasn't been that long since you

01:03:23.585 --> 01:03:29.178
left, maybe a few hours out of Ank'harel. So
you're maybe around ten o'clock in the evening or

01:03:29.178 --> 01:03:34.088
so, 10:30. Going to go ahead and move over here to
a non--

01:03:34.088 --> 01:03:37.046
TALIESIN: I was gonna argue that since he has the
Duck Totem, that technically he would have a

01:03:37.046 --> 01:03:39.554
natural migration sense of what direction he was
gonna go.

01:03:39.554 --> 01:03:42.679
MATT: That's a good argument to make, but not
necessary, but good for holding on to that.

01:03:42.679 --> 01:03:46.161
TALIESIN: Yeah, just thought I'd put that out
there. I feel like his duck sense would be

01:03:46.161 --> 01:03:48.563
tingling. Always knows where South is.

01:03:48.563 --> 01:03:50.753
MATT: Not denying. Recognized, but unnecessary in
the moment.

01:03:50.753 --> 01:03:52.385
TALIESIN: Unnecessary, but worth noting.

01:03:52.385 --> 01:03:59.776
MATT: Worth noting, indeed. But yeah. So the
spires of the mountain are surprisingly steep.

01:03:59.776 --> 01:04:04.417
They're steeple-like, almost, in a lot of places.
They're all just jutting up like these gargantuan

01:04:04.417 --> 01:04:09.967
spikes that were pressed out of the earth from
some sort of landmass shift or some volcanic

01:04:09.967 --> 01:04:16.782
activity long, long ago. But you can see the
densely packed rock formations, and the mountain

01:04:16.782 --> 01:04:27.285
cluster is maybe, at most, I'll say three miles,
four miles across. It's not a very, very big

01:04:27.285 --> 01:04:33.141
mountain range. And it's called Smouldercrown
because the circular pattern of the oval-like

01:04:33.141 --> 01:04:38.143
pattern of the mountains that rise up and
resembles at a distance like a king's crown in the

01:04:38.143 --> 01:04:44.019
way that it circles around itself. You recall one
of three different entrances, the one that was

01:04:44.019 --> 01:04:48.896
safest that you guys took when you entered, the
central portion of the mountain range from the

01:04:48.896 --> 01:04:52.898
outside, and you guide the rest of them to the
exterior of this space. You can see it's a small

01:04:52.898 --> 01:04:57.576
valley between two of the exterior mountains that
collide together, and there is a valley path,

01:04:57.576 --> 01:05:05.292
where you see a number of dried trees. Some do
appear to be alive, Keyleth, though they're

01:05:05.292 --> 01:05:12.552
designed to weather extreme droughts. They seem to
have some sort of weird fruit that they're

01:05:12.552 --> 01:05:19.724
bearing, dripping off some of the branches, but
the leaves themselves are brown and withered and

01:05:19.724 --> 01:05:24.284
you haven't quite seen plant la-life-- plant life
like this before.

01:05:24.284 --> 01:05:25.587
LAURA: Plant la-la-la.

01:05:25.587 --> 01:05:27.142
MATT: Plant la-va-la-fl.

01:05:27.142 --> 01:05:29.673
MARISHA: Does it look like it's natural decay?

01:05:29.673 --> 01:05:33.662
MATT: If you want to go and approach it and
inspect it, you can.

01:05:33.662 --> 01:05:36.254
MARISHA: How far-- we're still clouds?

01:05:36.254 --> 01:05:40.087
MATT: You guys are maybe 100 feet up or so, and
you've just now hit the edge of the Smouldercrown

01:05:40.087 --> 01:05:41.458
mountain range.

01:05:41.458 --> 01:05:43.181
MARISHA: Starting to go into the entrance.

01:05:43.181 --> 01:05:46.975
MATT: Yes. The entrance of the mountains. You
haven't found an entrance to the actual mountain

01:05:46.975 --> 01:05:48.656
rock itself.

01:05:48.656 --> 01:05:50.366
MARISHA: Are we going to go on foot from here?

01:05:50.366 --> 01:05:51.739
MATT: That's up to you guys.

01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:53.631
TALIESIN: I think we'll get a little closer.

01:05:53.631 --> 01:06:01.028
MARISHA: I'll wait 'til we get closer. From up
here, does the mountain formation look like it's

01:06:01.028 --> 01:06:08.161
naturally formed, or like some sort of other
event? Is it seismically formed?

01:06:08.161 --> 01:06:09.503
MATT: Make a nature check.

01:06:09.503 --> 01:06:20.401
MARISHA: Oh, not good. What's my nature? Okay,
16.

01:06:20.401 --> 01:06:28.824
MATT: 16, not bad. They appear to be seismically
formed. You can see some of the rocks, the way

01:06:28.824 --> 01:06:32.413
they rise up in the smaller areas, are at an angle
where it's smooth on one side, and you can see the

01:06:32.413 --> 01:06:37.310
layers beneath where portions of the earth seem to
have been jammed, cracked, and pushed upward. But

01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:42.506
because it's so localized, it isn't like there's
tectonic plates shifting or anything, it's not a

01:06:42.506 --> 01:06:48.267
mass range. Most mountain ranges are long, driven
locations that mark where those various boundaries

01:06:48.267 --> 01:06:53.569
are. This is just a central formation, so you're
uncertain as to what the nature of this creation

01:06:53.569 --> 01:06:55.490
was, but it seems natural.

01:06:55.490 --> 01:07:00.004
LAURA: I'm picturing beautiful Bob Ross mountains.
Just lightly touch.

01:07:00.004 --> 01:07:02.349
MARISHA: Happy accidents.

01:07:02.349 --> 01:07:04.242
TALIESIN: Happy little TPK.

01:07:04.242 --> 01:07:09.885
MATT: Yeah. Percy, can I have you roll a
perception check, please?

01:07:09.885 --> 01:07:16.971
TALIESIN: Yes. I'm not gonna roll that, 'cause
you've been-- I feel like that's yours. It landed

01:07:16.971 --> 01:07:21.946
on other dice. I'm gonna let it be there, though.
Actually, yeah, it's 20.

01:07:21.946 --> 01:07:30.458
MATT: Okay. You, Mr. Human, with no actual
Darkvision, do not get lost on the path. Taryon,

01:07:30.458 --> 01:07:32.833
could I have you also roll a perception check?

01:07:32.833 --> 01:07:40.560
SAM: 15 plus something. Minus one. 14.

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:44.695
MATT: Okay, so you fall a little behind the
group.

01:07:44.695 --> 01:07:47.654
SAM: Doty has low-light vision, I think.

01:07:47.654 --> 01:07:57.521
MATT: Doty has Darkvision. We'll say that Doty
manages to get you caught up a little bit. You

01:07:57.521 --> 01:08:00.564
fall a bit behind, but you do manage to find the
rest of the team. You don't get terribly lost in

01:08:00.564 --> 01:08:05.335
the middle of the dark, desert sky of these small
wisps of cloud with no light other than starlight

01:08:05.335 --> 01:08:10.884
there to guide your path forward. They begin to
just pull ahead and vanish into the horizon. You

01:08:10.884 --> 01:08:15.819
freak out but Doty eventually finds you as a cloud
and you swear you hear the wind go, "Tary."

01:08:15.819 --> 01:08:18.071
(laughter)

01:08:18.071 --> 01:08:21.247
MATT: You continue to push forward, eventually
leading into the outside of this entrance of

01:08:21.247 --> 01:08:25.961
Smouldercrown, where the rest of them have
gathered. You guys begin to slowly push into the

01:08:25.961 --> 01:08:32.265
valley that makes its way towards the center of
Smouldercrown, following Lionel's leads. These

01:08:32.265 --> 01:08:39.652
trees that you notice, Keyleth, they're sporadic
in places, and there is scrub brush, sparse, there

01:08:39.652 --> 01:08:43.173
are areas of the ground where it's dried and
cracked. The badlands here, the sands of the

01:08:43.173 --> 01:08:47.695
deserts, the big storms largely don't make it into
the center of the valley because the mountains

01:08:47.695 --> 01:08:50.672
protect it. While there are elements of it here
and there, you can see the

01:08:50.672 --> 01:08:57.918
topography and the landscape here is very dried,
cracked, red earth. Little moisture seems to be

01:08:57.918 --> 01:09:02.453
contained here. The plant life that exists here is
designed to subsist on very, very little water.

01:09:02.453 --> 01:09:10.723
You eventually come, Lionel, to the area where you
believe you found the last entrance. Make an

01:09:10.723 --> 01:09:15.735
investigation check, if you don't mind.

01:09:15.735 --> 01:09:18.258
JON: 21.

01:09:18.258 --> 01:09:25.310
MATT: 21, okay then. You very quickly look around
and recall some of the landmarks.

01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:26.758
JON: I'm still in cloud form.

01:09:26.758 --> 01:09:31.784
MATT: You're still in cloud form. But you see some
of the landmarks that seem to triangulate where

01:09:31.784 --> 01:09:35.599
you originally found the entrance. However, to
truly search in this area, you'd have to get low

01:09:35.599 --> 01:09:43.246
and probably go to your physical form to seek it
out. All right, so. You take a minute to

01:09:43.246 --> 01:09:46.131
concentrate and you revert back into your half-orc
form.

01:09:46.131 --> 01:09:49.910
LAURA: I go down and do it, too, 'cause he did
it.

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:51.309
MATT: Okay. Everyone else joining him?

01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:52.420
ALL: Yes.

01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:55.036
MATT: All right, so the rest of the party goes,
and they take their physical form.

01:09:55.036 --> 01:09:58.796
(laughter)

01:09:58.796 --> 01:10:00.245
JON: That was awesome, guys.

01:10:00.245 --> 01:10:04.857
LAURA: Is this where it is?

01:10:04.857 --> 01:10:09.095
MATT: You're able to see in the dark for a decent
amount. You walk the perimeter of this space where

01:10:09.095 --> 01:10:18.037
the first cavern was, and you feel around, and you
gather that there was a path here, but it looks

01:10:18.037 --> 01:10:22.853
like there's been a small cave-in. A lot of the
rocks appear like they've been recently fallen in,

01:10:22.853 --> 01:10:29.126
and there's some sort of a grade to them where you
watch loose rocks have recently been tossed around

01:10:29.126 --> 01:10:35.180
that are of a deeper-set red color and haven't
been quite as weathered as the exterior of the

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:41.476
mountain appears to be. So apparently the entrance
that you originally used either has collapsed on

01:10:41.476 --> 01:10:43.843
its own, or was intentionally shut.

01:10:43.843 --> 01:10:49.329
JON: I could've sworn it was right here, you guys.
I don't know what's with all these rocks.

01:10:49.329 --> 01:10:51.531
LAURA: It looks like it was caved in, actually.

01:10:51.531 --> 01:10:53.351
LIAM: This is 100% the spot?

01:10:53.351 --> 01:10:59.084
JON: Pretty sure. I mean, I don't have the best
memory or knowledge or brains or really any

01:10:59.084 --> 01:11:02.020
skills, but I'm pretty sure this was it.

01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:03.893
LAURA: Don't be so hard on yourself, Lionel.

01:11:03.893 --> 01:11:06.700
MARISHA: Does it look deliberate, or does it look
natural?

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:08.805
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:11:08.805 --> 01:11:11.814
JON: Well, it could be. I have an idea, you guys.
Let's ask the ducks!

01:11:11.814 --> 01:11:14.736
LAURA: Are there ducks here?

01:11:14.736 --> 01:11:16.286
JON: There's no ducks here?

01:11:16.286 --> 01:11:19.128
MARISHA: Natural 19 from Gil. 22.

01:11:19.128 --> 01:11:22.039
JON: We can see if there are if we Commune With
Ducks.

01:11:22.039 --> 01:11:28.290
MATT: The cave-in is not natural. The rocks you
can see, the portion of the archway where the

01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:37.204
natural mountain rock becomes the rockslide that
seems to have filled the space, there is no damage

01:11:37.204 --> 01:11:42.758
that seems to be seismic or quaked, and you can
see what appear to be some cleft sides at the edge

01:11:42.758 --> 01:11:47.047
of this entrance where it appears like elements of
it were actually hacked or damaged until it

01:11:47.047 --> 01:11:48.675
eventually fell in.

01:11:48.675 --> 01:11:52.850
LAURA: Are there any kind of tracks around, or
footfalls that look like it was recent?

01:11:52.996 --> 01:11:56.052
MATT: Roll a-- for you, it would be a survival
check, 'cause you're a tracker.

01:11:56.052 --> 01:11:57.581
LAURA: And it's a mountain!

01:11:57.581 --> 01:12:00.761
TALIESIN: I honestly think they might have trapped
it.

01:12:00.761 --> 01:12:02.735
LAURA: I can roll that one again.

01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:04.597
LIAM: I'll wait until she has looked, and then
I'll take a look.

01:12:04.597 --> 01:12:06.738
LAURA: Yeah, that's way better! 27!

01:12:06.738 --> 01:12:11.690
MATT: As you guys are having this moment, and you
get low to the ground and begin to read the

01:12:11.690 --> 01:12:15.898
patterns of the different rocks that have tumbled
and left small grooves and a little bit of dust

01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:23.751
and sand that does reside over this dark, caked
dirt and rock, and you do notice a number of

01:12:23.751 --> 01:12:28.925
footprints. They're scattered a bit, some older,
some newer. There's been a lot of foot traffic in

01:12:28.925 --> 01:12:35.940
and out of this cavern fairly recently, like a
week or so ago. And you begin to follow the

01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:40.621
tracks. Some lead back the path you came, some
seem to circle around further into the valley

01:12:40.621 --> 01:12:42.160
around this mountain.

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:48.847
LAURA: I think I've picked something up. Should we
follow it now or should we--

01:12:48.847 --> 01:12:50.344
SAM: It's dark.

01:12:50.344 --> 01:12:52.999
LAURA: -- camp out and do it in the morning.

01:12:52.999 --> 01:12:57.235
MARISHA: Cover for me. I'm gonna drop down and do
a Commune With Nature.

01:12:57.235 --> 01:13:05.139
TRAVIS: How do we cover you?

01:13:05.139 --> 01:13:07.322
TALIESIN: She talks to non-ducks.

01:13:07.322 --> 01:13:14.751
MARISHA: Can Lionel and I commune together and do
bonuses? Can I be like, can you call your ducks?

01:13:14.751 --> 01:13:17.264
JON: That's what I was trying to do.

01:13:17.264 --> 01:13:18.501
MARISHA: All right.

01:13:18.501 --> 01:13:23.089
MATT: I'll say, as you begin to cast the spell,
you take Lionel's hands and focus, and Lionel, you

01:13:23.089 --> 01:13:26.989
close your eyes and you imagine before you the
most beautiful desert duck that could ever exist.

01:13:26.989 --> 01:13:34.974
And for a good 45 seconds, 50 seconds, 60 seconds,
nothing. And that sadness in your heart sinks a

01:13:34.974 --> 01:13:42.202
bit, that perhaps Aes, or Scanlan, as these weird
people keep calling him, said, there are no ducks

01:13:42.202 --> 01:13:54.006
here. And you hear, in the darkness, (flapping
wings, squawk, impact sound). It runs into the

01:13:54.006 --> 01:13:59.188
side of the mountain, tumbles down onto the
ground. (duck sounds)

01:13:59.188 --> 01:14:01.142
SAM: It's a miracle!

01:14:01.142 --> 01:14:03.080
TALIESIN: It certainly is.

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.660
JON: The duck!

01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:06.606
LAURA: Wait, you can call them to you?

01:14:06.606 --> 01:14:09.493
JON: I mean, I just, normally that happens.

01:14:09.493 --> 01:14:11.679
LAURA: That's a power, that's amazing.

01:14:11.679 --> 01:14:13.933
TALIESIN: Do they obey you, or is it a partnership?

01:14:13.933 --> 01:14:17.828
LAURA: Could you call multiple to you and they
pick you up and fly you through the air?

01:14:17.828 --> 01:14:20.526
JON: You guys are confusing me. Look, I just talk
to them.

01:14:20.526 --> 01:14:22.082
MARISHA: You know, it's okay.

01:14:22.082 --> 01:14:23.970
TALIESIN: Let's not question this.

01:14:23.970 --> 01:14:27.380
MATT: So which of you wants to commune with the
duck?

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:30.011
LIAM: Let the expert.

01:14:30.011 --> 01:14:33.588
JON: Okay, what do we wanna know?

01:14:33.588 --> 01:14:36.172
MARISHA: How deep is the cave-in?

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:38.562
JON: How deep is the cave-in? Okay.

01:14:38.562 --> 01:14:40.582
SAM: To the duck?

01:14:40.582 --> 01:14:42.936
TALIESIN: They knew about the others.

01:14:42.936 --> 01:14:44.389
SAM: Sure, sure.

01:14:44.389 --> 01:14:46.915
JON: I ask the duck, how deep is the cave-in?

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:53.898
MATT: Okay, the duck, "20 feet".

01:14:53.898 --> 01:14:57.012
(laughter)

01:14:57.012 --> 01:14:59.566
TRAVIS: That's a chill-as-fuck duck, y'all!

01:14:59.566 --> 01:15:02.941
JON: You couldn't understand that. I was like, you
guys, that duck was really chill.

01:15:02.941 --> 01:15:05.260
(laughter)

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:08.121
LAURA: No, I can tell, his body language is super
chill for a duck.

01:15:08.121 --> 01:15:15.702
JON: 20 feet. What else do we want? Do we wanna
ask if he recognizes who did this?

01:15:15.702 --> 01:15:17.790
MARISHA: That's a good one, that's a good one,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:28.041
JON: Hey, greenie. How-- who did this? What caused
the cave-in?

01:15:28.041 --> 01:15:30.658
MATT: "People."

01:15:30.658 --> 01:15:40.631
MARISHA: You know, I have a similar problem when I
try to talk to cows. They have face-blindness.

01:15:40.631 --> 01:15:43.565
LAURA: I'm just gonna stealthily start following
the path around.

01:15:43.565 --> 01:15:45.060
MATT: Stealth check.

01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:50.008
MARISHA: Is there another entrance into this
cavern?

01:15:50.008 --> 01:15:56.243
JON: That's good, that's good. Should we ask the
nearest? Where's the nearest entrance?

01:15:56.243 --> 01:15:58.101
LAURA: 29.

01:15:58.101 --> 01:15:59.928
JON: Or the safest entrance?

01:15:59.928 --> 01:16:01.921
MARISHA: Are there other entrances?

01:16:01.921 --> 01:16:12.168
JON: Hey, Greenie, how many other entrances are
there to this, about?

01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:13.918
MATT: "Two."

01:16:13.918 --> 01:16:17.095
JON: Two. Uh-oh, that was two questions.

01:16:17.095 --> 01:16:19.566
MARISHA: Is that two including this entrance?

01:16:19.566 --> 01:16:21.699
MATT: (flapping wings)

01:16:21.699 --> 01:16:24.029
JON: Wait, wait, wait!

01:16:24.029 --> 01:16:26.935
TRAVIS: Duck Hunt! Shoot it! Vex!

01:16:26.935 --> 01:16:31.687
JON: Meant to ask where the entrances are. Sorry,
you guys.

01:16:31.687 --> 01:16:37.929
MARISHA: Well, there is another one. It's good,
it's fine, it's good. In fact, I can double down

01:16:37.929 --> 01:16:45.014
on this. Can I now do my Commune With Nature and
see if I can map out this cavern and find the

01:16:45.014 --> 01:16:46.897
other entrances?

01:16:46.897 --> 01:16:57.229
MATT: Okay, so as you've now sat down, and you
focus, you can sense the guardian duck that was

01:16:57.229 --> 01:17:02.153
temporarily summoned is now wandering out to the
desert, probably to dehydrate and die horribly

01:17:02.153 --> 01:17:04.066
when the morning light comes.

01:17:04.066 --> 01:17:09.195
JON: I don't know about this, I don't know about
this. Aw, he's going home to his family.

01:17:09.195 --> 01:17:11.487
TALIESIN: In a way, yes.

01:17:11.487 --> 01:17:19.426
MATT: However, you connect and you can feel your
spiritual essence connect with the land here. The

01:17:19.426 --> 01:17:22.536
landscape is something you're not used to.
Elements of it remind you of Pyrah, though not as

01:17:22.536 --> 01:17:32.059
visceral and volcanic, but the general heat and
barren aspect of the landscape is familiar in some

01:17:32.059 --> 01:17:36.070
ways. So as you extend yourself, you can breathe
and you can feel the land breathe with you, and as

01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:39.237
that communion hits, you feel you could ask some
questions of the terrain.

01:17:39.237 --> 01:17:44.314
MARISHA: Where are the other two entrances to this
cavern?

01:17:44.314 --> 01:17:54.228
MATT: You get, as is the essence of answering
these questions, you sense that there is one near

01:17:54.228 --> 01:18:02.717
the top of the spire and there is one not terribly
far from where you are, kind of continuing inward

01:18:02.717 --> 01:18:07.596
towards the valley. But it doesn't specify
directly where, it doesn't put an 'x' on your map

01:18:07.596 --> 01:18:12.623
for you. You just know that one's towards the top,
and one's further around the path you're going.

01:18:12.623 --> 01:18:25.977
MARISHA: Can I-- hang on-- around the path. Okay.
How deep is the Ziggurat from here? Can I sense

01:18:25.977 --> 01:18:27.601
the other Ziggurat?

01:18:27.601 --> 01:18:35.144
MATT: You focus, and you sense that there is
almost like a cyst in the ground. You can sense

01:18:35.144 --> 01:18:47.432
some subterranean cavern. Maybe about 400, 500
feet into the heart of the mountain from where you

01:18:47.432 --> 01:18:53.545
currently sit. You can sense there this kind of
pulsing darkness, almost like a terrible,

01:18:53.545 --> 01:18:56.195
cancerous heartbeat in the center of this land.

01:18:56.195 --> 01:19:04.962
MARISHA: Okay. What else? What's the last one?
What should I do?

01:19:04.962 --> 01:19:07.376
SAM: Are there any people around?

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:09.736
TALIESIN: Has anybody been through that upper
passageway?

01:19:09.736 --> 01:19:14.863
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, can I sense any other
maraudering douchebags?

01:19:14.863 --> 01:19:19.843
MATT: Well, you can ask questions about people,
powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or

01:19:19.843 --> 01:19:22.849
undead, influence from means of other existences.

01:19:22.849 --> 01:19:25.458
MARISHA: Humanoids? What about humanoids?

01:19:25.458 --> 01:19:33.141
MATT: You want to try and sense humanoids? You ask
about it. Your attention is shifted back towards

01:19:33.141 --> 01:19:43.320
that weird cyst-Ziggurat area in the center of the
mountain, and the land seems to give you the idea

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.231
that there are a number of humanoids there right
now.

01:19:46.231 --> 01:19:48.541
MARISHA: Shit. Do they look like cultist-y
people?

01:19:48.541 --> 01:19:52.353
MATT: You don't have a visual. Your vision isn't
brought there, you just kind of sense that they're

01:19:52.353 --> 01:19:55.273
there. They're inside the mountain.

01:19:55.273 --> 01:19:56.987
MARISHA: What?

01:19:56.987 --> 01:19:59.531
JON: I could've told you there was people at the
pyramid.

01:19:59.531 --> 01:20:01.545
TALIESIN: Well, last time. Who's here now?

01:20:01.545 --> 01:20:03.780
JON: Well, why would they leave?

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:07.951
MARISHA: I don't know. I said there's all these
cool cult people.

01:20:07.951 --> 01:20:09.592
Yeah, they could leave.

01:20:09.778 --> 01:20:11.300
JON: It's good to know that they're still there.

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:16.119
TRAVIS: Were there people inside?

01:20:16.119 --> 01:20:17.974
MARISHA: A decent amount of people.

01:20:17.974 --> 01:20:19.638
MATT: So Vex is gone.

01:20:19.638 --> 01:20:21.070
TRAVIS: Where's Vex?

01:20:21.070 --> 01:20:23.182
LIAM: What did you find out?

01:20:23.182 --> 01:20:27.954
MARISHA: A lot of people. There's another entrance
nearby, I think further

01:20:27.954 --> 01:20:29.591
down this path. It's close.

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:31.315
LIAM: Well, Vex went this way. Is it in that
direction?

01:20:31.315 --> 01:20:32.910
MARISHA: What? What do you mean? She went where?

01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:35.510
MATT: You actually didn't see the direction she
went.

01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:38.686
LIAM: Do we see footprints going in a direction,
though, you described?

01:20:38.686 --> 01:20:42.220
MATT: Nobody else did. Only she was tracking.
Literally,

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:44.151
you all turn around and Vex is just gone.

01:20:44.151 --> 01:20:49.893
MARISHA: I think there's also an entrance at the
top of this spire, if we want to do a downward

01:20:49.893 --> 01:20:52.311
approach, but that seems risky.

01:20:52.311 --> 01:21:01.828
MATT: You follow the tracks, and about 200 or so
feet around the edge, and you have to follow them

01:21:01.828 --> 01:21:06.249
between a few smaller rocks that are jutting out
at the base of the mountain, and the terrain

01:21:06.249 --> 01:21:10.748
itself rolls a bit, and cracks in places. There
are small fissures from recent rains that caused

01:21:10.748 --> 01:21:16.370
the earth to well up and tear in places, and
eventually the tracks curve in towards the

01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:21.081
mountain and end, and it's just sheer mountain.
There's no sign of an entryway visually.

01:21:21.081 --> 01:21:22.735
LAURA: Can I search for one?

01:21:22.735 --> 01:21:24.941
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:21:24.941 --> 01:21:28.094
LAURA: Do I get advantage because it's a
mountain?

01:21:28.094 --> 01:21:31.482
MATT: You do, actually, yes. Favored terrain.

01:21:31.482 --> 01:21:34.293
LAURA: Fucking balls. Perception?

01:21:34.293 --> 01:21:35.703
MATT: Investigation.

01:21:35.703 --> 01:21:38.719
LAURA: No, I want perception.

01:21:38.719 --> 01:21:40.554
MATT: You're getting investigation.

01:21:40.554 --> 01:21:42.151
LAURA: 11.

01:21:42.151 --> 01:21:48.225
MATT: 11? You have no idea where the entrance is.
The tracks end in this general vicinity, and it's

01:21:48.225 --> 01:21:52.766
just rock. It doesn't even look like there's
handholds.

01:21:52.766 --> 01:21:59.970
LAURA: Weird. I wonder if it's an illusion. Can I
put my hand on the rocks

01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:01.510
and see if there's an illusion?

01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:04.586
MATT: Okay. You put your hands out to feel against
the rock, and your hand passes through.

01:22:04.586 --> 01:22:15.700
LAURA: What-what! I feel like Vex is really good
at finding illusions. Oh, shit! Okay, well, can I

01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:18.883
put the front of my face through the wall and see
what I see?

01:22:18.883 --> 01:22:24.955
MATT: Sure. You poke into the darkness, and it is
pitch-black on the inside. As you poke past the

01:22:24.955 --> 01:22:33.534
illusion, it's about two inches or so of this
rocky, heavy orange-red stone, and as you peer in

01:22:33.534 --> 01:22:40.379
you can see a cavern about ten feet wide or so and
about 12 to ten feet tall. Natural along the

01:22:40.379 --> 01:22:47.233
walls, you can see the ground itself is smoothed
over, and it's straight. It's a straight tunnel.

01:22:47.233 --> 01:22:51.166
It's not a rocky natural formation, it's like it
was pushed and carved into the rock, like

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:58.956
something heavy or something very focused drove
through. You glance over to the side, and you

01:22:58.956 --> 01:23:09.023
catch what appears to be a face in the wall, about
that big around. It's featureless, you just see

01:23:09.023 --> 01:23:18.642
two eye sockets, a mouth, and a nose. You see a
flash of green light. I need you to make a

01:23:18.642 --> 01:23:20.389
constitution saving throw.

01:23:20.389 --> 01:23:23.748
LAURA: Well, it's too late. Constitution saving
throw?

01:23:23.748 --> 01:23:27.645
TRAVIS: Can we also say that we put our earrings
back in the next day?

01:23:27.645 --> 01:23:28.855
MATT: I assumed you did.

01:23:28.855 --> 01:23:30.517
TRAVIS: Because we're professionals.

01:23:30.517 --> 01:23:36.510
LAURA: That was almost so good, but then it
wasn't. Ten.

01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:38.151
MATT: Ten. No, that does not succeed.

01:23:38.151 --> 01:23:42.761
TRAVIS: Curious little cat.

01:23:42.761 --> 01:23:45.799
LAURA: I'm a rogue now, you guys!

01:23:45.799 --> 01:23:47.466
TALIESIN: Had to poke it.

01:23:47.466 --> 01:23:56.524
MATT: You take 61 points of necrotic damage. As a
familiar sting, as the green light flash turns

01:23:56.524 --> 01:24:02.276
into a piercing beam of life-draining energy, one
that once almost brought you to the edge of death

01:24:02.276 --> 01:24:07.440
before, and as it hits you, you feel your breath
and life essence sucked out of your nose and mouth

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:13.333
and ears like a giant vacuum is pulling the
essence out of your body. The veins bulge, you

01:24:13.333 --> 01:24:18.062
can't breathe, and you pull yourself back out of
the illusory wall, and have to gasp for a moment.

01:24:18.062 --> 01:24:20.822
You guys hear the gasping as you begin to approach
that side, and you find

01:24:20.822 --> 01:24:23.146
your sister there grabbing herself.

01:24:23.146 --> 01:24:28.019
LAURA: (coughing) Jenga. Not full Jenga.

01:24:28.019 --> 01:24:29.995
ASHLEY: What happened, what happened, what
happened?

01:24:29.995 --> 01:24:34.965
LAURA: Don't go through the wall. Can I heal,
Pike?

01:24:34.965 --> 01:24:36.505
ASHLEY: Yes, yes.

01:24:36.505 --> 01:24:41.220
LAURA: There's a thing in there. There's a face,
and it sucks your life out. I found a door,

01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:42.320
though, guys!

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.030
JON: Where's the door?

01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:46.491
LAURA: Don't. I'm not even going to tell you where
the door is.

01:24:46.491 --> 01:24:48.457
I'm not going to tell him where the door is.

01:24:48.457 --> 01:24:50.688
TRAVIS: We don't see a door.

01:24:50.688 --> 01:24:52.207
JON: I don't see a door.

01:24:52.207 --> 01:24:56.290
LAURA: Nobody touch the rocks!

01:24:56.290 --> 01:24:58.296
LIAM: But there's a bad door somewhere around
here?

01:24:58.296 --> 01:25:05.037
LAURA: There's a bad door. Just listen for a
moment. Bad door. Right in front of me: fake, bad

01:25:05.037 --> 01:25:11.497
door. If you go through it, there is a very bad
face that sucks your life out.

01:25:11.497 --> 01:25:12.804
LIAM: A bad face.

01:25:12.804 --> 01:25:14.052
LAURA: Yeah.

01:25:14.052 --> 01:25:17.680
TALIESIN: There's a door you cannot see, and a bad
face sucks your life away.

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:25.181
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to take my Oracle Arrow and
crouch down.

01:25:25.181 --> 01:25:27.643
SAM: Wait, wait, wait, before you do that, are you
sure that's--

01:25:27.643 --> 01:25:29.493
LIAM: Yeah, slow down, you're doing all the shit.

01:25:29.493 --> 01:25:31.971
SAM: You're going to just shoot something in
there? What if they see it fly in?

01:25:31.971 --> 01:25:34.628
LAURA: That's why I was going to crouch down and
shoot the arrow super low to the ground.

01:25:34.628 --> 01:25:36.988
LIAM: What if they still see the arrow fly in?

01:25:36.988 --> 01:25:41.184
LAURA: Well, when I peeked my head in, before I
got my life sucked out, I didn't see anything in

01:25:41.184 --> 01:25:42.321
front of me. Did I?

01:25:42.321 --> 01:25:46.753
LIAM: I'm going to assume that before we heard her
gasping, Keyleth was filling us in.

01:25:46.753 --> 01:25:54.633
MARISHA: You know, I think it's right around that
direction. Follow the gasping. It feels like it's

01:25:54.633 --> 01:25:56.295
really close to the gasping.

01:25:56.295 --> 01:26:02.202
LIAM: I'm going to go check out the top. (mist
sound)

01:26:02.202 --> 01:26:04.831
LAURA: Give me shit, and then take off on your
own.

01:26:04.831 --> 01:26:06.773
LIAM: Well, I'm not going to stick my face in
something.

01:26:06.773 --> 01:26:15.963
MATT: All right. So you fly up. (flapping wings)
60 feet a round. It'll take you a good five

01:26:15.963 --> 01:26:20.219
minutes or so to make your way towards the top end
of the spire. As you're going, make an

01:26:20.219 --> 01:26:21.611
investigation check.

01:26:21.611 --> 01:26:23.464
LIAM: Can I stealth as cloud?

01:26:23.464 --> 01:26:27.694
MATT: Oh, you're going cloud! Sorry, I thought you
were doing your wings. As a cloud, you get there

01:26:27.694 --> 01:26:33.527
really fast. So as you make it up there, you
cannot-- I will say, for the purposes of this...

01:26:33.527 --> 01:26:36.310
LIAM: I'm wind. I'm not going high, I'm going
through the treetops.

01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:38.978
MATT: Yeah, so make a stealth check.

01:26:38.978 --> 01:26:45.550
LIAM: All right, I will. That is very good. That
is a 35.

01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:51.904
MATT: 35, okay. As far as you understand, no one
seems to see you. Make an investigation check as

01:26:51.904 --> 01:26:54.544
you make your way up the mountainside to check for
any sort of entrances.

01:26:54.544 --> 01:26:56.816
LAURA: You should mark off one of your Lucks
because you already used it for the day.

01:26:56.816 --> 01:26:58.462
LIAM: I did, it's on the plastic.

01:26:58.462 --> 01:27:00.333
SAM: Keep him honest.

01:27:00.333 --> 01:27:10.911
LIAM: Oh man. I love you so wholeheartedly, and on
a regular basis you kick me in the goolies. I

01:27:10.911 --> 01:27:12.466
don't understand it.

01:27:12.466 --> 01:27:15.000
SAM: Good old four-Luck O'Brien.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:26.889
LIAM: Seven Luck. It's not per game, it's per day,
so if we go to bed, it resets. Fart knockers. I'm

01:27:26.889 --> 01:27:32.071
doing investigation? That's 18.

01:27:32.071 --> 01:27:41.573
MATT: 18. You glide around there for a good ten,
15 minutes or so, scouring the edge. All you know

01:27:41.573 --> 01:27:44.124
is it's near the top, and you see no sign of an
entrance.

01:27:44.124 --> 01:27:47.148
LIAM: Okay. So it's not a volcanic hole or
anything, there's just a secret entrance.

01:27:47.148 --> 01:27:51.299
MATT: No. She told you there was supposedly an
entrance, but you see nothing. Sheer rock. There

01:27:51.299 --> 01:27:54.753
are a couple of indents that could be cave
entrances, but when you get close you see it's

01:27:54.753 --> 01:27:57.040
just a small alcove that ends.

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:59.991
LAURA: Maybe you should try sticking your face
against some of the sheer rock face.

01:27:59.991 --> 01:28:08.479
LIAM: I return to my loving sister, kind and good.
I land, and say, I saw another face, but I didn't

01:28:08.479 --> 01:28:10.610
stick my face in it, because that would be
stupid.

01:28:10.610 --> 01:28:14.127
MARISHA: I wonder if there's another face behind
the cave-in.

01:28:14.127 --> 01:28:18.096
LAURA: You know what, I should probably find out!
And I shoot the Oracle Arrow.

01:28:18.096 --> 01:28:20.437
MATT: Okay. You shoot the Oracle Arrow and--

01:28:20.437 --> 01:28:23.598
MARISHA: Wait, into the cave-in, or the illusory
wall?

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:26.344
MATT: How far do you fire it? Is it full strength,
is it a lob?

01:28:26.344 --> 01:28:30.149
LAURA: No, I don't want to go crazy far. I want to
get in, a little bit further to see if I can find

01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:32.337
any more traps, and see how that face works.

01:28:32.337 --> 01:28:36.207
TRAVIS: What percentage of your strength do you
shoot it at? 70? 50? 25?

01:28:36.207 --> 01:28:38.594
LAURA: 65 percent of my strength is used.

01:28:38.594 --> 01:28:46.203
MATT: Okay. (whoosh) As you release it, it's still
a good distance. It (whoosh) continues through. As

01:28:46.203 --> 01:28:51.488
you go past the face, the one that shot the green
light, you can see the front of it is darkened

01:28:51.488 --> 01:28:59.324
now, from where before it was untouched. It
cruises past. You see the formations. It looks

01:28:59.324 --> 01:29:05.080
like there's some cool designs here and there. The
arrow eventually comes to rest. You don't see

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:12.874
anything of interest as you pass by that quickly.
You do see a very, very faint glow down the hall.

01:29:12.874 --> 01:29:19.048
You can see the glimmer of light, and as you
watch, it's shifting ever so slightly, flickering

01:29:19.048 --> 01:29:20.455
like firelight.

01:29:20.455 --> 01:29:22.271
LAURA: I think there's a fire further in.

01:29:22.271 --> 01:29:24.344
TRAVIS: Was the face there?

01:29:24.344 --> 01:29:25.765
LAURA: The face is in there.

01:29:25.765 --> 01:29:27.306
TRAVIS: Was it doing the life-sucking thing?

01:29:27.306 --> 01:29:30.332
LAURA: Not to my arrow. But it was there on the
wall.

01:29:30.332 --> 01:29:31.604
TRAVIS: I'll go in.

01:29:31.604 --> 01:29:33.131
LAURA: No, no, no, Grog, don't!

01:29:33.131 --> 01:29:34.947
ASHLEY: She got hurt!

01:29:34.947 --> 01:29:36.671
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I'm stacked for days.

01:29:36.671 --> 01:29:38.214
LAURA: We should dispel it or something.

01:29:38.214 --> 01:29:40.223
JON: I got your back, Grog.

01:29:40.223 --> 01:29:43.050
TALIESIN: We've got another entrance.

01:29:43.050 --> 01:29:44.657
MARISHA: I can Dispel Magic still.

01:29:44.657 --> 01:29:47.037
LAURA: Yeah, see if you can dispel the magic!

01:29:47.037 --> 01:29:48.874
TALIESIN: Let's see if there's a second entrance.

01:29:48.874 --> 01:29:52.050
MARISHA: Well, there is a second entrance. One is
up top.

01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:56.660
TALIESIN: Well, they're going to think we're
coming in through here, because they know about

01:29:56.660 --> 01:30:00.907
this entrance. Maybe they don't know about the
other one, so we could maybe be super tricky and

01:30:00.907 --> 01:30:02.757
take an entrance they don't know about at all.

01:30:02.757 --> 01:30:07.900
MARISHA: I can clear out the cave-in. I imagine if
someone is trying to cause an intentional cave-in,

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:12.504
they're anticipating no one going through that
cave-in, and we can start there.

01:30:12.504 --> 01:30:15.436
JON: I at least know my way in, if we cleared
that.

01:30:15.436 --> 01:30:21.778
TALIESIN: If I were expecting people, I'd expect
them through the entrance I take or the cave-in,

01:30:21.778 --> 01:30:26.012
not a third entrance I don't know about, though.
Assuming they don't know about it.

01:30:26.012 --> 01:30:28.953
MARISHA: But they do know about the up. He said
there was a face.

01:30:28.953 --> 01:30:31.344
JON: No, he's talking about the third entrance,
that's lower.

01:30:31.344 --> 01:30:32.674
TALIESIN: Higher.

01:30:32.674 --> 01:30:34.237
JON: No, I thought that was the higher one.

01:30:34.237 --> 01:30:40.422
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on. There are three
entrances: the cave-in, the one where Vex just got

01:30:40.422 --> 01:30:42.562
exploded, and one through the top of the spire.

01:30:42.562 --> 01:30:44.548
LIAM: Which I could not find.

01:30:44.548 --> 01:30:47.426
TALIESIN: Should we take a group look for the top
of the spire?

01:30:47.426 --> 01:30:51.159
MARISHA: If we go through the cave-in entrance, I
can clear it out. I will clear one of my last

01:30:51.159 --> 01:30:54.556
high-level spells, but Lionel knows his way
through that way.

01:30:54.556 --> 01:30:57.762
LAURA: Yeah, but we shouldn't go in the night. We
need to rest.

01:30:57.762 --> 01:30:59.493
MARISHA: But I can clear it tonight.

01:30:59.493 --> 01:31:05.555
TALIESIN: We could just make a tiny hole in the
cave-in and become smoke and go inside. Is that

01:31:05.555 --> 01:31:08.191
not possible? He asked.

01:31:08.191 --> 01:31:10.877
MATT: That may be quite possible, actually.

01:31:10.877 --> 01:31:12.900
TALIESIN: So that they wouldn't even know that we
had cleared it.

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:15.230
It would just be relatively untouched.

01:31:15.230 --> 01:31:16.799
MARISHA: Can we camp out inside?

01:31:16.799 --> 01:31:19.288
MATT: It's a gaseous form, so yeah.

01:31:19.288 --> 01:31:22.078
LAURA: We would have to camp inside the cave-in.

01:31:22.078 --> 01:31:27.159
TALIESIN: It's either that or camp right in front
of the front door after just triggering a spell.

01:31:27.159 --> 01:31:34.993
LAURA: Oh, Scanlan! We've been so long without
you, I forgot we had it!

01:31:34.993 --> 01:31:38.775
MARISHA: Oh my god, we have the mansion!

01:31:38.775 --> 01:31:41.403
LIAM: I mean, only if you want to. I remember that
being a sore spot.

01:31:41.403 --> 01:31:48.600
SAM: I don't even know if you guys want me to come
in with you. I've taken you this far. But if you

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:50.267
need me in there, I'll come.

01:31:50.267 --> 01:31:54.051
ASHLEY: No, you'll be coming.

01:31:54.051 --> 01:31:59.542
SAM: All right. Let's make a hole and go in, and
then we can camp the night inside.

01:31:59.542 --> 01:32:05.429
JON: I think some of my dead comrades we could use
as pillows. They're probably still in there.

01:32:05.429 --> 01:32:06.978
TALIESIN: That may not be necessary.

01:32:06.978 --> 01:32:10.204
ASHLEY: Body pillow.

01:32:10.204 --> 01:32:17.346
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you! That was amazing!

01:32:17.346 --> 01:32:21.891
MATT: So what's the plan, guys?

01:32:21.891 --> 01:32:29.473
LAURA: We're going to go back to the cave-in. Oh,
wait, wait, wait! I did have a question. I feel

01:32:29.473 --> 01:32:33.459
like it might be smart to get my arrow out of
there, in case anybody

01:32:33.459 --> 01:32:35.714
comes out and sees an arrow.

01:32:35.714 --> 01:32:37.380
ASHLEY: That's a good idea.

01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:40.992
LAURA: But I don't know how to do that. Is there
an Unseen Servant or something?

01:32:40.992 --> 01:32:42.610
JON: I'll run in real fast and get it.

01:32:42.610 --> 01:32:48.200
SAM: No, do not do that. I, Scanlan Shorthalt, can
go get it, if you'd like.

01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:50.002
LAURA: No, Scanlan, that's not what I meant.

01:32:50.002 --> 01:32:51.443
SAM: I can go get it if you'd like.

01:32:51.443 --> 01:32:53.396
LAURA: No, I don't want you to go in! It fucking
sucks your life out!

01:32:53.396 --> 01:32:56.502
SAM: It's easy. I'll be there and back in two
seconds.

01:32:56.502 --> 01:32:58.244
JON: But there's a face-sucking thing.

01:32:58.244 --> 01:33:00.999
LAURA: Do I know how many feet in it went?

01:33:00.999 --> 01:33:10.004
MATT: You're not entirely certain. I'd say a
couple hundred, maybe. 150.

01:33:10.004 --> 01:33:11.822
TRAVIS: You did 65 percent of your...

01:33:11.822 --> 01:33:21.598
SAM: You're an expert marksman, you know. Within
100 feet? Yeah, how about this? Why don't you

01:33:21.598 --> 01:33:25.203
shoot an arrow right now, outside the cave, same
strength, and see how far it goes?

01:33:25.203 --> 01:33:26.475
LAURA: You got it.

01:33:26.475 --> 01:33:28.945
MATT: Okay. So what's the range on your bow?

01:33:28.945 --> 01:33:34.949
LAURA: Oh, that's a good question. Fenthras,
exalted.

01:33:34.949 --> 01:33:38.550
MATT: It's a longbow. It's just a general
longbow's range. Do you have that written down?

01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:44.037
LAURA: What? Like 120 feet? Is it that, or is it
more?

01:33:44.037 --> 01:33:48.795
MATT: 150 is your first increment, and then 600 is
your second increment.

01:33:48.795 --> 01:33:54.020
TALIESIN: 65 is like 400 feet.

01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:55.474
MATT: Approximately, yeah.

01:33:55.474 --> 01:33:58.044
TALIESIN: Or the closest wall. Did it hit a wall?

01:33:58.044 --> 01:33:59.460
MATT: It did not hit a wall.

01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:00.921
TALIESIN: 400 feet.

01:34:00.921 --> 01:34:04.004
LAURA: That's really far. No, but how would you do
it? How would you do it?

01:34:04.004 --> 01:34:06.277
SAM: I have ways.

01:34:06.277 --> 01:34:11.206
LIAM: Could you see through the mouth of this face
that you saw, when you were in there?

01:34:11.206 --> 01:34:12.757
LAURA: I saw eyes.

01:34:12.757 --> 01:34:18.272
MATT: There was no eyes. There was empty sockets,
a mouth, and a nose, and then suddenly the sockets

01:34:18.272 --> 01:34:20.449
began to glow green for a second, and then the
hit.

01:34:20.449 --> 01:34:22.541
LAURA: The sockets glowed green and then I got
hit.

01:34:22.541 --> 01:34:24.670
LIAM: So you couldn't see through the mouth, it
was just a dark maw.

01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:26.362
LAURA: Right. But the eyes glowed.

01:34:26.362 --> 01:34:28.520
ASHLEY: You're just going to go in there,
Scanlan?

01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:30.076
SAM: You want to come?

01:34:30.076 --> 01:34:34.489
ASHLEY: How are you going to do this?

01:34:34.489 --> 01:34:36.677
SAM: The way I always go. Dimension Door.

01:34:36.677 --> 01:34:39.580
LAURA: What if it can reach you that far in?

01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:41.173
SAM: It can't.

01:34:41.173 --> 01:34:43.316
ASHLEY: How do you know?

01:34:43.316 --> 01:34:45.028
SAM: I assume.

01:34:45.028 --> 01:34:51.436
ASHLEY: Well, I'm not going with you!

01:34:51.436 --> 01:34:53.115
SAM: Great.

01:34:53.115 --> 01:34:55.090
LIAM: I'll go with you.

01:34:55.090 --> 01:34:56.216
SAM: You can't.

01:34:56.216 --> 01:34:57.786
LAURA: You're too big.

01:34:57.786 --> 01:35:02.299
SAM: I'll just go. Dimension Door 400 feet
straight in.

01:35:02.299 --> 01:35:06.798
ASHLEY: Wait, I'll go with him. I'm going to go
with you. I'm keeping my eye on him.

01:35:06.798 --> 01:35:13.860
MATT: All right. (poof) You guys appear inside the
cavern. Darkness. You can see the firelight ahead,

01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:18.329
the flicker at the end of the tunnel, and you can
see the tunnel, the straight portion of it, maybe

01:35:18.329 --> 01:35:22.320
100 feet forward, begins to shift and bend a
little bit. It starts to turn into more of a

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:27.383
natural cavern as it goes. Whatever drove its way
in here has merged with a natural path on the

01:35:27.383 --> 01:35:35.321
inside of the mountain, possibly even merged with
the cave-in path. You look on the ground, and both

01:35:35.321 --> 01:35:38.103
of you guys make investigation checks, if you
don't mind.

01:35:38.103 --> 01:35:43.290
ASHLEY: Investigation, did you say?

01:35:43.290 --> 01:35:44.730
SAM: 30.

01:35:44.730 --> 01:35:50.336
ASHLEY: I'm sure he found something. 11.

01:35:50.336 --> 01:35:56.569
MATT: In the time it takes you to go, "Okay, we're
looking..." He's like, "Found it!" You find the

01:35:56.569 --> 01:36:00.866
arrow. A little dust drifts off of it, and as
you're walking you can see that there's a softness

01:36:00.866 --> 01:36:07.142
to the ground here. You get the sense that the
formation, whatever rock was pushed through here,

01:36:07.142 --> 01:36:16.390
was... There's no pile of rock outside, there's no
symbol of the earth that was carved out of this

01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:22.323
tunnel, recently it seems, placed anywhere.
There's just an absence of rock, and there's a

01:36:22.323 --> 01:36:24.533
heavy layer of dust on the ground.

01:36:24.533 --> 01:36:35.086
LAURA: Do either of you have Dust of
Tracelessness?

01:36:35.086 --> 01:36:36.384
ASHLEY: No. Well.

01:36:36.384 --> 01:36:37.412
SAM: Go back?

01:36:37.412 --> 01:36:38.683
ASHLEY: Yeah. Let's go back.

01:36:38.683 --> 01:36:40.056
SAM: Will you hold my hand?

01:36:40.056 --> 01:36:42.129
ASHLEY: No. No, don't push your luck.

01:36:42.129 --> 01:36:45.765
MATT: (poof) You guys bamf back out of the
outside. You watch as Scanlan and Pike reemerge

01:36:45.765 --> 01:36:48.362
from the outside, Scanlan holding your arrow
triumphant.

01:36:48.362 --> 01:36:53.107
LAURA: Oh, it's dusty. Was it dusty in there?

01:36:53.107 --> 01:36:55.115
SAM: It was very dusty in there.

01:36:55.115 --> 01:36:56.708
LIAM: Any footprints?

01:36:56.708 --> 01:36:59.237
ASHLEY: None that we could see.

01:36:59.237 --> 01:37:01.238
SAM: Soft un-tread earth.

01:37:01.238 --> 01:37:02.665
LIAM: Weird.

01:37:02.665 --> 01:37:03.963
LAURA: Thank you.

01:37:03.963 --> 01:37:05.425
MARISHA: Oh, no.

01:37:05.425 --> 01:37:08.245
LIAM: What is it, Kiki?

01:37:08.245 --> 01:37:15.981
MARISHA: Maybe this is the unused entrance. Maybe
the cave-in is the more recent.

01:37:15.981 --> 01:37:20.254
LAURA: No, I see tracks coming in and out of this
place. I know there's people that use this.

01:37:20.254 --> 01:37:21.885
MATT: Yeah, fairly recent tracks.

01:37:21.885 --> 01:37:24.968
LIAM: But you saw no footprints inside?

01:37:24.968 --> 01:37:29.469
ASHLEY: Did you, Scanlan? You should've seen
something. Did you look?

01:37:29.469 --> 01:37:33.604
SAM: No, I forgot. I was looking for the arrow.
That was our mission.

01:37:33.604 --> 01:37:38.326
ASHLEY: Well, I was just making sure you weren't
going to run away, so I was preoccupied.

01:37:38.326 --> 01:37:40.773
JON: So you guys both accomplished your missions!
Awesome!

01:37:40.773 --> 01:37:50.258
LAURA: Maybe we should go back into the other
side, then. Unless somebody can just fucking dispel

01:37:50.258 --> 01:37:52.907
that face, and then we can just go in this way.

01:37:52.907 --> 01:37:56.868
MARISHA: I could attempt it. I have Dispel Magic
with me right now.

01:37:56.868 --> 01:37:57.968
TRAVIS: Do it!

01:37:57.968 --> 01:37:59.776
MARISHA: All right. I'll do it.

01:37:59.776 --> 01:38:03.018
LIAM: Is the plan to camp out tonight? In the
mansion, by a fire, whichever?

01:38:03.018 --> 01:38:04.291
LAURA: In the mansion.

01:38:04.291 --> 01:38:09.200
TALIESIN: I'm going to point out, I've already
been looking for a way into the cave-in while

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:11.057
you've all been being ridiculous.

01:38:11.057 --> 01:38:13.167
LAURA: You've already gone back?

01:38:13.167 --> 01:38:17.698
TALIESIN: The minute he suggested that he get it,
I didn't want to be a part of that, so I just

01:38:17.698 --> 01:38:23.057
immediately went in to start testing to see if
there was ways we could just meld through the

01:38:23.057 --> 01:38:25.175
cave-in, or if we actually had to make a hole.

01:38:25.175 --> 01:38:28.315
MATT: So you're inspecting?

01:38:28.315 --> 01:38:32.784
TALIESIN: I misty-ed out of that the minute that
he started working on it.

01:38:32.784 --> 01:38:35.334
MATT: So you're over, currently looking for a way
through?

01:38:35.334 --> 01:38:38.253
TALIESIN: Seeing if I can find ways through.

01:38:38.253 --> 01:38:43.648
MATT: You manage to squeeze through a few crevices
between the stones and rock, but it's pretty

01:38:43.648 --> 01:38:47.920
densely packed. You get maybe five feet in before
you can't really find a way to get your whole mist

01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:48.941
form through.

01:38:48.941 --> 01:38:54.001
TALIESIN: I'm going to start, back to normal, at
the very top of the pile, looking to see if I can

01:38:54.001 --> 01:38:58.384
start scraping through using my sword to make a
crevice.

01:38:58.384 --> 01:39:00.518
MATT: Okay, so you're working on that. What are
you guys doing?

01:39:00.518 --> 01:39:07.512
SAM: Are we trying to dispel the magic or are we
going in the other way? Maybe we should just make

01:39:07.512 --> 01:39:08.936
a decision.

01:39:08.936 --> 01:39:10.507
MARISHA: I'm trying to dispel the magic.

01:39:10.507 --> 01:39:12.130
MATT: Okay. So you walk up to the illusory wall.

01:39:12.130 --> 01:39:18.531
MARISHA: I'm having Vex be like, tell me where it
is. Can I prepare it so as soon as I poke my head

01:39:18.531 --> 01:39:20.291
in, I can be like (dink)!

01:39:20.291 --> 01:39:23.542
MATT: Okay. You poke your head in, and as soon as
you glance off to the side, you can see the stone

01:39:23.542 --> 01:39:24.868
face in the wall.

01:39:24.868 --> 01:39:26.172
MARISHA: (poof)

01:39:26.172 --> 01:39:29.911
MATT: Cast Dispel Magic... Doesn't seem to have an
effect.

01:39:29.911 --> 01:39:32.053
MARISHA: Bail. Bail! Bail! Out!

01:39:32.053 --> 01:39:34.652
LAURA: Did it hit you that fast? It didn't hit
you?

01:39:34.652 --> 01:39:37.517
MATT: There was no attack from the face, either.

01:39:37.517 --> 01:39:41.131
TALIESIN: I get the distinct impression, perhaps,
that you used it up, and probably alerted them

01:39:41.131 --> 01:39:43.194
that somebody was at that entrance.

01:39:43.194 --> 01:39:45.127
LAURA: Let's maybe move away from the entrance.

01:39:45.127 --> 01:39:48.516
MARISHA: Can I peek my head back in and do a...

01:39:48.516 --> 01:39:53.516
MATT: You glance in. No trigger, nothing. The face
seems inert.

01:39:53.516 --> 01:39:56.626
LAURA: I peek my head in. Does the flickering
light in the distance seem brighter?

01:39:56.626 --> 01:39:58.509
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:39:58.509 --> 01:40:04.867
LAURA: It's too many choices. Too many dice.
Fucking shit, motherfuck!

01:40:04.867 --> 01:40:07.423
Wait, wait, it's a mountain.

01:40:07.423 --> 01:40:10.869
MATT: It is a mountain. You get to have an
advantage. That's what rangers do, man!

01:40:10.869 --> 01:40:13.180
LIAM: Was the light seen by the arrow?

01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:16.079
MATT: The light was seen by the arrow.

01:40:16.079 --> 01:40:18.103
LIAM: So you're looking at the face.

01:40:18.103 --> 01:40:20.316
LAURA: No, I'm looking in the fucking tunnel.

01:40:20.316 --> 01:40:21.990
MATT: The face is on the side of it. It's beyond.

01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:23.191
LIAM: Oh, it keeps going?

01:40:23.191 --> 01:40:26.071
MATT: Yeah. So depending on how high her
perception is, she may, now that she sees the

01:40:26.071 --> 01:40:28.827
flicker at the end, she may be able to see
something. So how high did you roll?

01:40:28.827 --> 01:40:30.093
LAURA: 31.

01:40:30.093 --> 01:40:34.578
MATT: That would be high enough to just barely
focus your half-elven eyes and glance down. You

01:40:34.578 --> 01:40:40.311
get to see the very faint bead of light at the
very tip, and it doesn't seem to change over the

01:40:40.311 --> 01:40:44.052
next 30 seconds, next minute, next two minutes
while you focus intently.

01:40:44.052 --> 01:40:46.421
You don't see any shift or change.

01:40:46.421 --> 01:40:49.478
ASHLEY: Should we just go in?

01:40:49.478 --> 01:40:50.740
LAURA: We could.

01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:53.218
JON: So you think the face is recharging?

01:40:53.218 --> 01:40:58.339
LAURA: I think I might have used up its only
charge, potentially. Or it's recharging.

01:40:58.339 --> 01:41:00.363
JON: It's like a booby trap, used once.

01:41:00.363 --> 01:41:05.593
LIAM: I will take a look at it, and look at the
area and see if there's anything left to it or

01:41:05.593 --> 01:41:07.612
other traps further down.

01:41:07.612 --> 01:41:09.780
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:12.991
SAM: Well, if he's going in, Taryon will go in and
Identify the thing.

01:41:12.991 --> 01:41:16.183
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an arcana check.

01:41:16.183 --> 01:41:17.283
LIAM: 19.

01:41:17.283 --> 01:41:21.306
MATT: 19, okay. You glance by, you check it. As
you both are looking at it, both Taryon and Vax

01:41:21.306 --> 01:41:29.121
approach the face, and the carving is rudimentary.
It looks more like it was prepared as the basis

01:41:29.121 --> 01:41:30.583
of-- what did you roll?

01:41:30.583 --> 01:41:32.276
SAM: 17, but I've got Identify.

01:41:32.276 --> 01:41:36.693
MATT: Yeah. There's no magical essence to it any
longer, but your arcana check shows that you can

01:41:36.693 --> 01:41:42.442
see that there are certain small carvings in it
that look to be some sort of sigil or glyph that

01:41:42.442 --> 01:41:47.811
is designed to hold a spell until triggered, and
then it's released. Actually, Pike, you've used

01:41:47.811 --> 01:41:55.349
this once before. It's an actual Glyph of Warding
spell that is utilized to hold a spell in and

01:41:55.349 --> 01:41:57.644
release it upon some sort of a trigger.

01:41:57.644 --> 01:42:00.057
SAM: So it's one-time use, so we're good to go in
this way if we'd like.

01:42:00.057 --> 01:42:02.927
LAURA: Does the Glyph of Warding alert you once
it's gone off?

01:42:02.927 --> 01:42:05.392
ASHLEY: I don't think so.

01:42:05.392 --> 01:42:10.231
MATT: You don't recall. You didn't know your glyph
went off until you found the destroyed body of the

01:42:10.231 --> 01:42:12.621
prisoner that you had released in Westruun long
ago.

01:42:12.621 --> 01:42:15.902
LAURA: Oh, right. The guy that was stealing all
that gold.

01:42:15.902 --> 01:42:19.598
ASHLEY: And then I think we also put one on the
top of the loot for the dragon?

01:42:19.598 --> 01:42:23.150
MATT: That's the one that got him. He tried to get
some money on the way out, and you found his body

01:42:23.150 --> 01:42:26.418
blown up and dragged about 20 feet off before he
expired.

01:42:26.418 --> 01:42:28.206
ASHLEY: Yeah, I don't think it alerts anybody.

01:42:28.206 --> 01:42:35.574
LAURA: Okay, good. Then we are probably safe going
in. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on us.

01:42:35.574 --> 01:42:44.319
I'm going to see how many people I can cast it on.
Every creature I choose within 30 feet of me! So,

01:42:44.319 --> 01:42:46.230
sweet, it's everybody.

01:42:46.230 --> 01:42:52.400
MATT: Yep. All right. You notice, Lionel, as you
guys step in, even in your Darkvision-- which, by

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:59.336
the way, for your two human companions, it is
complete darkness. You had a little bit of

01:42:59.336 --> 01:43:02.365
starlight, and your eyes had adjusted to it where
you could see the edges and rims of different

01:43:02.365 --> 01:43:06.239
shapes within the mountain range, but once you
step past the illusory barrier into the interior

01:43:06.239 --> 01:43:08.394
of the cavern, it is just darkness.

01:43:08.394 --> 01:43:09.824
LAURA: Is Percy back yet?

01:43:09.824 --> 01:43:12.549
TALIESIN: Yes, I just got back.

01:43:12.549 --> 01:43:14.853
LAURA: Percy, hold on to my waist, dear.

01:43:14.853 --> 01:43:16.521
SAM: Should we use our flashlights or no?

01:43:16.521 --> 01:43:18.008
TALIESIN: No, I don't think so.

01:43:18.008 --> 01:43:20.566
LIAM: I'm going to stay 30 feet in front of the
group and continue to check for traps.

01:43:20.566 --> 01:43:23.377
MATT: All right, so everyone roll stealth.

01:43:23.377 --> 01:43:29.922
LAURA: And add ten to it because of Pass Without a
Trace.

01:43:29.922 --> 01:43:34.899
SAM: Doty's going to click his boots of whatever.
His boots of elven...

01:43:34.899 --> 01:43:38.295
MATT: That give him the bonus on stealth checks?

01:43:38.295 --> 01:43:40.118
SAM: Yeah, elvenkind.

01:43:40.118 --> 01:43:44.039
TRAVIS: 26.

01:43:44.039 --> 01:43:51.357
ASHLEY: 30! That's never going to happen again.

01:43:51.357 --> 01:43:54.254
MATT: Vex?

01:43:54.254 --> 01:43:55.753
LAURA: 25.

01:43:55.753 --> 01:43:57.035
LIAM: 37.

01:43:57.035 --> 01:43:58.793
MATT: Pike is more stealthy than Vex right now!

01:43:58.793 --> 01:44:00.391
LAURA: It's because Percy's holding on to my
waist.

01:44:00.391 --> 01:44:01.814
MATT: I understand. Keyleth?

01:44:01.814 --> 01:44:02.812
MARISHA: 26.

01:44:02.812 --> 01:44:03.933
TALIESIN: 21.

01:44:03.933 --> 01:44:05.168
JON: 28.

01:44:05.168 --> 01:44:16.708
SAM: Scanlan got 29, Taryon got 25, and Doty got a
two, but with his boots--

01:44:16.708 --> 01:44:19.093
what do his boots do? Shit!

01:44:19.093 --> 01:44:21.084
MATT: The boots give him advantage on stealth
checks. He gets to roll again.

01:44:21.084 --> 01:44:24.677
SAM: Okay. 17! Plus ten, yeah.

01:44:24.677 --> 01:44:31.385
MATT: There you go. So you guys silently make your
way in. I would like a marching order on this,

01:44:31.385 --> 01:44:36.848
because it is about ten feet wide, this tunnel,
and you guys can only go in there two at a time,

01:44:36.848 --> 01:44:37.975
shoulder-to-shoulder.

01:44:37.975 --> 01:44:40.058
TALIESIN: Who's got the best night vision?

01:44:40.058 --> 01:44:46.093
LAURA: Actually, Doty has the best night vision.
He's got complete Darkvision? Oh, we all have

01:44:46.093 --> 01:44:47.638
Darkvision.

01:44:47.638 --> 01:44:49.645
MATT: Okay, so Vax and Pike in the front.

01:44:49.645 --> 01:44:54.955
LIAM: Check for traps, check for traps, check for
traps.

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:59.634
LAURA: We didn't take a nap.

01:44:59.634 --> 01:45:03.293
SAM: Do you want to stop and camp?

01:45:03.293 --> 01:45:04.884
LAURA: Maybe in a little bit.

01:45:04.884 --> 01:45:08.601
TALIESIN: I'm all right with the notion of getting
a little deeper in.

01:45:08.601 --> 01:45:12.334
MATT: All right, so. Pike and Vax at the front.
All right. Who's after them?

01:45:12.334 --> 01:45:14.816
LAURA: Me and Percy.

01:45:14.816 --> 01:45:18.039
ASHLEY: I tug on Vax's shirt just to let him know
I'm there.

01:45:18.039 --> 01:45:22.350
SAM: I feel like good old Chod should be near the
tip of the spear since he knows the inside of this

01:45:22.350 --> 01:45:23.789
place a bit.

01:45:23.789 --> 01:45:25.536
LAURA: That's true. What did he roll for stealth?

01:45:25.536 --> 01:45:27.182
MATT: He rolled a 28 I think.

01:45:27.182 --> 01:45:28.562
JON: Have I been in this area?

01:45:28.562 --> 01:45:31.802
MATT: You have not been in this specific tunnel.
You haven't seen anything that looks familiar. The

01:45:31.802 --> 01:45:35.420
path you went before was a natural cavern. This
one is pushed straight through.

01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:41.260
JON: Yeah. But I can see how, I'm the only one
who's been in this mountain, so there's maybe a

01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:45.173
little trust. I got this! I haven't been here, but
I got it!

01:45:45.173 --> 01:45:47.339
MATT: All right, so do you push your way towards
the front?

01:45:47.339 --> 01:45:48.448
JON: Sure.

01:45:48.448 --> 01:45:52.421
MATT: All right. So, Pike and Vax, as you guys are
moving forward, your bardbarian friend pushes

01:45:52.421 --> 01:45:56.076
aside and muscles up to become the point at the
tip of the sphere.

01:45:56.076 --> 01:45:59.029
JON: I crop-dust all of you as I go in front of
you.

01:45:59.029 --> 01:46:04.403
MATT: After that, after Percy and Vex?

01:46:04.403 --> 01:46:06.263
MARISHA: I'll go.

01:46:06.263 --> 01:46:11.256
MATT: All right. Keyleth, and we still have
Taryon, Scanlan...

01:46:11.256 --> 01:46:13.835
SAM: Taryon next, with Doty with him.

01:46:13.835 --> 01:46:20.801
MATT: Taryon with Doty behind. Doty is going to be
two people in the cavern. So who's behind Doty?

01:46:20.801 --> 01:46:22.103
TRAVIS: Me.

01:46:22.103 --> 01:46:24.088
MATT: All right, Grog. And...

01:46:24.088 --> 01:46:26.559
SAM: Scanlan will be in the rear.

01:46:26.559 --> 01:46:29.618
MATT: All right, so Scanlan is alongside Grog. I
imagine you have Trinket in your necklace?

01:46:29.618 --> 01:46:30.835
LAURA: Yes.

01:46:30.835 --> 01:46:35.081
MATT: All right. So at the very end, Grog, you're
walking, and Scanlan's there at your side, and

01:46:35.081 --> 01:46:39.213
Doty walking in front of you, lumbering,
surprisingly quiet. And you get the sense the

01:46:39.213 --> 01:46:43.921
reason you're so stealthy in here is because as
you step, it's soft. It's like stepping on a bunch

01:46:43.921 --> 01:46:49.447
of very, very fine powder. (heavy footsteps) It
helps cushion your footfalls.

01:46:49.447 --> 01:46:53.084
MARISHA: Like snow? Or ash?

01:46:53.084 --> 01:46:55.588
MATT: Like ash, almost. Like a very, very fine
dust.

01:46:55.588 --> 01:47:00.569
MARISHA: Can I dip down and grab a bit of it and
do a nature check on it? Is it ash?

01:47:00.569 --> 01:47:02.716
MATT: Sure, make a nature check.

01:47:02.716 --> 01:47:04.544
LAURA: It's cocaine!

01:47:04.544 --> 01:47:10.418
MATT: First she eats the soul, then she just does
a line in the middle of the tunnel. Keyleth's gone

01:47:10.418 --> 01:47:12.144
off the end, it's really bad.

01:47:12.144 --> 01:47:13.149
MARISHA: 15.

01:47:13.149 --> 01:47:20.328
MATT: 15's not too bad. You taste it, and you
smell it. It's not ash. It's very, very, very fine

01:47:20.328 --> 01:47:23.606
powder. It has an earthy rock taste to it.

01:47:23.606 --> 01:47:27.248
LIAM: And are there any tracks or footprints ahead
of Pike and I?

01:47:27.248 --> 01:47:29.539
MATT: Make a survival check.

01:47:29.539 --> 01:47:34.564
LIAM: Survival. Ooh, that's good. 19.

01:47:34.564 --> 01:47:38.515
MATT: 19. You do see some tracks stepping up and
down, yes.

01:47:38.515 --> 01:47:39.645
LIAM: Both ways?

01:47:39.645 --> 01:47:40.834
MATT: Both ways.

01:47:40.834 --> 01:47:42.069
LIAM: Shite.

01:47:42.069 --> 01:47:46.075
MATT: All right. So pushing forward, another 30 or
40 feet, roll another investigation check.

01:47:46.075 --> 01:47:47.994
LIAM: Not perception?

01:47:47.994 --> 01:47:51.911
MATT: Not for checking for traps, man, it's
investigation. Always been.

01:47:51.911 --> 01:47:53.181
LIAM: 21.

01:47:53.181 --> 01:47:54.800
MATT: 21, okay.

01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:58.559
SAM: Fine, if Matt wants to change the rules 100
games in, I guess so.

01:47:58.559 --> 01:48:03.212
MATT: All right, so you continue moving forward.
You do not see any traps, anything that catches

01:48:03.212 --> 01:48:04.479
your attention.

01:48:04.479 --> 01:48:09.670
MARISHA: Can I just do a little, I'm going to
scoop up a little bit and say, Percy, can I get a

01:48:09.670 --> 01:48:13.553
little bit of water added onto this? Can I do
another nature check on what this is?

01:48:13.553 --> 01:48:15.891
TRAVIS: You are fucking fascinated with the god
damn ash.

01:48:15.891 --> 01:48:19.787
MATT: I'm not going to tell you to make another
nature check. You can't keep making rolls until

01:48:19.787 --> 01:48:25.918
you get a better one. It turns into an immediate
mud. It's a very, very fine silt, almost.

01:48:25.918 --> 01:48:28.460
TALIESIN: What color is the rock?

01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:30.056
MATT: The powder, you mean?

01:48:30.056 --> 01:48:32.046
TALIESIN: I can't see anything, can I? Never
mind.

01:48:32.046 --> 01:48:35.128
MATT: You can see nothing. In fact, when you say,
"Percy, get some water on this," you're like,

01:48:35.128 --> 01:48:38.672
"What? I don't-- where?" You have to guide his
hand.

01:48:38.672 --> 01:48:41.028
LIAM: And is it dead silent in here?

01:48:41.028 --> 01:48:44.417
MATT: It's dead quiet from where you currently
are. You can make a perception check to listen in

01:48:44.417 --> 01:48:46.235
to see if you hear anything ahead.

01:48:46.235 --> 01:48:48.576
LIAM: 24.

01:48:48.576 --> 01:48:58.103
MATT: 24. You listen carefully and you hear faint
sounds of footsteps and scraping stone. In one

01:48:58.103 --> 01:49:03.867
little, sounds like a (whistle), like a brief
sucking sound, and that's it.

01:49:03.867 --> 01:49:15.604
LIAM: Over the earring, not alone. Not alone.
Something up ahead. I don't think we're camping.

01:49:15.604 --> 01:49:24.708
LAURA: If we camp, then they won't find us. They
can't see the door.

01:49:24.708 --> 01:49:31.618
LIAM: What do y'all want to do?

01:49:31.618 --> 01:49:34.035
TRAVIS: You're on point. Keep going.

01:49:34.035 --> 01:49:38.422
ASHLEY: I say we keep going. If it's an emergency,
we can all jump into the mansion, maybe.

01:49:38.422 --> 01:49:42.039
TALIESIN: I'll activate my boots.

01:49:42.039 --> 01:49:44.067
ASHLEY: Is everybody okay to keep going?

01:49:44.067 --> 01:49:50.525
MATT: Okay. You continue another 40, 50 feet down
the path. Make another investigation check.

01:49:50.525 --> 01:49:54.620
LIAM: Natural 20.

01:49:54.620 --> 01:50:03.197
MATT: You go a little further ahead and you come
upon what appears to be two more of those faces,

01:50:03.197 --> 01:50:09.224
that are facing the inside of the wall maybe 30
feet ahead. And you stop. You can see they're both

01:50:09.224 --> 01:50:12.075
facing outward, towards the center of the
hallway.

01:50:12.075 --> 01:50:22.260
LIAM: Kiki, a couple more faces. Can you shimmy
your way up here, please?

01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:27.849
MARISHA: I get down on my hands and elbows.

01:50:27.849 --> 01:50:32.562
LAURA: Percy, spread your legs! I let her crawl
through us.

01:50:32.562 --> 01:50:34.455
LIAM: Left hand green!

01:50:34.455 --> 01:50:36.825
MARISHA: Where are they?

01:50:36.825 --> 01:50:43.033
LIAM: Right over there, right up ahead, 30 feet.
Both sides.

01:50:43.033 --> 01:50:47.942
MATT: He points it out to you, and you can just
barely see the smooth walls, the almost oval,

01:50:47.942 --> 01:50:55.499
circular passageway, you can see the slight lift
of the side rock where the faces

01:50:55.499 --> 01:50:57.696
form a very faint profile.

01:50:57.696 --> 01:51:06.931
MARISHA: I scootch a few more inches and use my
last two 3rd-level spells.

01:51:06.931 --> 01:51:10.610
MATT: Okay. Roll a d20. Add your wisdom modifier,
please.

01:51:10.610 --> 01:51:12.538
MARISHA: Just my straight modifier?

01:51:12.538 --> 01:51:14.010
MATT: Yep.

01:51:14.010 --> 01:51:19.751
MARISHA: Don't fuck me Gil! Okay, that's good,
that's good. 19 on the first one.

01:51:19.751 --> 01:51:21.745
MATT: Okay, roll again on the second one.

01:51:21.745 --> 01:51:25.658
MARISHA: 18 on the second one.

01:51:25.658 --> 01:51:32.944
MATT: Okay. As you take a moment (whoosh), the
first one releases, and you watch as the face

01:51:32.944 --> 01:51:40.507
suddenly begins to glow with this dull, grayish,
black crackling energy, and then (poof). The

01:51:40.507 --> 01:51:47.651
energy seems to vanish and disperse, with the one
on the left. You turn and release Dispel Magic on

01:51:47.651 --> 01:51:51.779
the one on the right, and you watch as the same
effect happens. (poof) Disperses as well.

01:51:51.779 --> 01:51:55.316
MARISHA: Okay, we're good!

01:51:55.316 --> 01:52:04.144
LAURA: (sings) You're the best around! Okay, keep
going forward.

01:52:04.144 --> 01:52:10.703
LIAM: Grab her shoulder, move slowly past, pull
Pickle along, and continue to carefully search.

01:52:10.703 --> 01:52:16.858
MATT: Okay. As you approach and step toward the
space right between where the two faces are, you

01:52:16.858 --> 01:52:22.168
make one footfall between the two of them, and
nothing happens.

01:52:22.168 --> 01:52:23.960
You successfully dispelled the effect.

01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:25.386
ASHLEY: You sneaky.

01:52:25.386 --> 01:52:36.221
MATT: Wanted to fuck with you. You continue
pushing forward for another 50 or so feet. You're

01:52:36.221 --> 01:52:40.187
starting to get fairly close at this point to
where the arrow may have dropped.

01:52:40.187 --> 01:52:45.033
LAURA: Oh, shit, you were right by fucking other
faces when you popped in before!

01:52:45.033 --> 01:52:48.744
MATT: You moved just a little bit beyond them.
Make another investigation check. You're not there

01:52:48.744 --> 01:52:50.267
yet, but you're getting closer.

01:52:50.267 --> 01:52:53.620
LIAM: 18.

01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:59.003
MATT: 18, okay. You don't seem to notice any
strange or different elements of the topography

01:52:59.003 --> 01:53:03.367
that worry you. You push on for another 40, 50
feet or so, and you're just now on the cusp of

01:53:03.367 --> 01:53:05.999
where the arrow dropped. Make another
investigation check.

01:53:05.999 --> 01:53:08.831
LAURA: Roll super good.

01:53:08.831 --> 01:53:16.374
LIAM: That's at least an 18. Oh, it's better than
18. It is 26.

01:53:16.374 --> 01:53:23.195
MATT: Okay. You don't notice any traps or any
issues in the vicinity. You do see the footprints

01:53:23.195 --> 01:53:29.325
of Pike and Scanlan where they first arrived
earlier before, venturing into this cavern, and

01:53:29.325 --> 01:53:34.084
pushing forward about 20 or so feet, the smooth
cavern begins to turn into more of a natural,

01:53:34.084 --> 01:53:41.745
almost a volcanic tube-type physicality to it, and
you can see to the left, another tunnel merges

01:53:41.745 --> 01:53:46.638
with it. You begin to recognize this. It looks
like this carved tunnel is now dovetailing into

01:53:46.638 --> 01:53:53.586
the path that you guys found your way in, the one
that was collapsed on the exit. Now the path that

01:53:53.586 --> 01:53:56.896
you know and the path you're traversing have
finally merged into one singular path.

01:53:56.896 --> 01:54:02.224
JON: I know this place, you guys! Let's go down
the left one.

01:54:02.224 --> 01:54:03.496
LAURA: Shh!

01:54:03.496 --> 01:54:05.845
TALIESIN: Left?

01:54:05.845 --> 01:54:12.249
JON: Yeah. There's one that's-- we can either go
straight, or there's one at the...

01:54:12.249 --> 01:54:15.248
MATT: The one that's on the left will lead you
back to the entrance where you first came in, but

01:54:15.248 --> 01:54:18.236
it was collapsed, the one that you knew. If you
keep going straight, it'll lead you towards the

01:54:18.236 --> 01:54:20.522
light and where you saw these people last time you
were here.

01:54:20.522 --> 01:54:26.859
JON: If we go left, it's going to take us back the
other way, so that's safe, but we could keep going

01:54:26.859 --> 01:54:28.884
straight where the light is.

01:54:28.884 --> 01:54:32.332
LIAM: We're here for your friends, right?

01:54:32.332 --> 01:54:35.198
JON: Yeah, they might still be alive. And I call
out, hello?

01:54:35.198 --> 01:54:45.061
MATT: Okay. It echoes. "Hello?" Everyone make a
perception check.

01:54:45.061 --> 01:54:52.971
SAM: Right now I'm looking at the back of Grog's
ass. But I got a 19.

01:54:52.971 --> 01:54:54.734
MARISHA: Natural 19.

01:54:54.734 --> 01:54:56.191
TRAVIS: 10.

01:54:56.191 --> 01:54:57.925
ASHLEY: 22.

01:54:57.925 --> 01:54:59.851
LAURA: 22.

01:54:59.851 --> 01:55:01.603
JON: 21.

01:55:01.603 --> 01:55:03.810
TALIESIN: 13.

01:55:03.810 --> 01:55:05.710
MATT: 19, you got, right?

01:55:05.710 --> 01:55:08.648
MARISHA: Yeah. That's a 34 total.

01:55:08.648 --> 01:55:10.758
LIAM: 32.

01:55:10.758 --> 01:55:20.171
MATT: All right. Everyone over 20, you listen and
you can hear very faint voices (whispering), and

01:55:20.171 --> 01:55:22.946
it sounds like movement moving quicker.

01:55:22.946 --> 01:55:26.130
LAURA: Scanlan? Maybe now is the time for that
door.

01:55:26.130 --> 01:55:28.684
SAM: For the door? The mansion?

01:55:28.684 --> 01:55:29.872
LAURA: Yeah.

01:55:29.872 --> 01:55:32.935
SAM: Okay. It takes a minute to cast.

01:55:32.935 --> 01:55:35.808
LIAM: That's not going to work. We've got company
coming.

01:55:35.808 --> 01:55:37.653
LAURA: How near do the voices sound?

01:55:37.653 --> 01:55:40.922
MATT: They don't sound like they're getting
louder. Doesn't sound like they're getting closer,

01:55:40.922 --> 01:55:42.317
you just hear voices.

01:55:42.317 --> 01:55:43.614
SAM: Do you want me to?

01:55:43.614 --> 01:55:47.749
LAURA: Let's backtrack to the caved-in tunnel.

01:55:47.749 --> 01:55:49.671
JON: Maybe it's my friends. Should we go?

01:55:49.671 --> 01:55:53.769
LAURA: No. Let's backtrack to the caved-in tunnel
and set up the door.

01:55:53.769 --> 01:55:56.884
MARISHA: You guys go. I'll wait here just in
case.

01:55:56.884 --> 01:55:58.415
JON: I'll stay with you.

01:55:58.415 --> 01:56:00.152
TALIESIN: Be quiet.

01:56:00.152 --> 01:56:03.351
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way towards the
caved-in entrance.

01:56:03.351 --> 01:56:09.564
TALIESIN: I'll stay with the two of you because I
can't see shit and I'll slow you down. If things

01:56:09.564 --> 01:56:11.553
happen, they're going to light up. It'll be all
right.

01:56:11.553 --> 01:56:17.036
MATT: Okay. So you guys make your way back to the
entranceway.

01:56:17.036 --> 01:56:19.565
LIAM: I actually stay halfway between both.

01:56:19.565 --> 01:56:24.852
MATT: You stay halfway between, okay. It's roughly
about 150, 200 feet this direction. It's a

01:56:24.852 --> 01:56:30.448
shallower cavern to this area than the one you
came through. It's a longer way in, but you manage

01:56:30.448 --> 01:56:36.285
to find the other end of this cave-in. It's rocks
that have tumbled in and clustered. Keyleth, you

01:56:36.285 --> 01:56:43.206
glance over and you see shapes moving in the
light, and as you glance up ahead, about 30 feet

01:56:43.206 --> 01:56:46.506
ahead of you, you see six figures heading your
direction. Humanoid.

01:56:46.506 --> 01:56:51.881
SAM: That's 100,000 dollars, yo. Six figures,
moving your direction!

01:56:51.881 --> 01:57:05.575
MARISHA: Holy shit, a brand new Tesla is coming
this way! Okay. Hey, we have people. We have

01:57:05.575 --> 01:57:10.124
people coming this way, about six of them. Just
letting you know, probably going to be some

01:57:10.124 --> 01:57:14.686
fighting coming up, and that is your update from
the Voice of the Tempest.

01:57:14.686 --> 01:57:17.132
LIAM: I'm creeping back.

01:57:17.132 --> 01:57:20.981
MATT: All right. So you go ahead and you meet up
with Keyleth. The rest of you are back by the

01:57:20.981 --> 01:57:23.166
doorway. Scanlan, you're taking a minute to cast
this?

01:57:23.166 --> 01:57:25.018
SAM: I mean, you told me to do this, right?

01:57:25.018 --> 01:57:28.146
LAURA: I thought we were not going to fight, but
it's up to everybody else.

01:57:28.146 --> 01:57:30.818
TALIESIN: We may need a place to disappear to, so
yes.

01:57:30.818 --> 01:57:33.000
MARISHA: It's not a bad idea. We can hold them
off.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.333
SAM: Okay. I'm out of the fight, then. So I'll
start casting and singing.

01:57:37.333 --> 01:57:40.533
MATT: Okay, so Scanlan begins working on casting
the magnificent--

01:57:40.533 --> 01:57:47.174
SAM: (sings) When people keep repeating that you
need a place to sleep, when everybody starts

01:57:47.174 --> 01:57:57.495
retreating but you need a really cool keep, let
Scanlan open the door. Let Scanlan open the door!

01:57:57.495 --> 01:58:02.615
Let Scanlan open the door to your house!

01:58:02.615 --> 01:58:05.307
MATT: So as this is commencing-- Oh, I've missed
that.

01:58:05.307 --> 01:58:09.819
JON: I've never heard music. I want to stay back
with him. No, I'm kidding, I want to stay. I'm

01:58:09.819 --> 01:58:11.393
still with her.

01:58:11.393 --> 01:58:16.871
MATT: All right, so we have Lionel, Keyleth, and
eventually Vax, and the rest of you are still back

01:58:16.871 --> 01:58:17.849
at the entranceway.

01:58:17.849 --> 01:58:18.854
MARISHA: And Percy.

01:58:18.854 --> 01:58:19.869
MATT: Oh, Percy's there.

01:58:19.869 --> 01:58:21.658
LAURA: I'm going to stand at the entrance of the
tunnel and guard Scanlan.

01:58:21.658 --> 01:58:24.513
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, you keep an eye out and you
watch as they approach. They're in a sprint, a

01:58:24.513 --> 01:58:29.030
wild sprint. You notice the humanoid figures,
there's a lot of clacking sounds, and you

01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:33.794
immediately notice they're thinner than a
fleshed-out human. These are skeletal. They are

01:58:33.794 --> 01:58:39.597
skeletons in armor with shields and weapons, and
they're (snarling) scattering through the hallway

01:58:39.597 --> 01:58:41.631
towards you at a very fast pace.

01:58:41.631 --> 01:58:48.166
MARISHA: I'm just going to say, Pike? Pike, I
think we've got some undead coming our way.

01:58:48.166 --> 01:58:51.564
Probably going to need some Divine Smiting.

01:58:51.564 --> 01:58:53.206
ASHLEY: Coming right up.

01:58:53.206 --> 01:58:56.171
MATT: Pike's little legs start making her way.
It's going to take you a while to get there.

01:58:56.171 --> 01:59:02.221
MARISHA: As I call Pike, I'm going to go ahead and be
like, here we go. (boom).

01:59:02.382 --> 01:59:03.420
MATT: What do you do?

01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:04.623
MARISHA: Fireball.

01:59:04.623 --> 01:59:05.962
MATT: A Fireball!

01:59:05.962 --> 01:59:07.839
MARISHA: I can see them, right? They're close
enough?

01:59:07.839 --> 01:59:09.820
MATT: For a Fireball, most definitely.

01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:12.156
MARISHA: Okay. Out of the spire.

01:59:12.156 --> 01:59:16.084
MATT: So. Keyleth, I want you to go ahead and
roll your damage.

01:59:16.084 --> 01:59:25.746
MARISHA: Okay. Fireball is... Hang on, wait, I'm
not a sorcerer. I should've had this prepared. I

01:59:25.917 --> 01:59:39.160
admit I should've had this. It's something d8?
d10's? Fireball. 8d6 fire damage.

01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:41.618
MATT: One of them rolled a natural 20.

01:59:41.618 --> 01:59:45.615
MARISHA: One, two, three, four, five, six, give me
two more.

01:59:45.615 --> 01:59:48.468
MATT: That was a 19 and a 20.

01:59:48.468 --> 01:59:53.353
MARISHA: A 19 and a 20? That's a lot.

01:59:53.353 --> 01:59:55.197
MATT: Your spell DC is what, 21?

01:59:55.197 --> 01:59:57.306
MARISHA: 21, yeah.

01:59:57.306 --> 01:59:59.177
MATT: All right, so two of them make their save.

01:59:59.177 --> 02:00:00.974
TALIESIN: You re-roll.

02:00:00.974 --> 02:00:13.283
MARISHA: I reroll ones. (counting) 34 damage.

02:00:13.283 --> 02:00:18.959
MATT: 34 damage. All right. You watch as four of
these skeletons explode, their bones detonating

02:00:18.959 --> 02:00:25.536
and exploding all over the cavern. You watch as it
bounces around and breaks and shatters, and you

02:00:25.536 --> 02:00:29.661
hear them all clattering into the dust below. Two
more push through the flames. You can see the

02:00:29.661 --> 02:00:33.820
armor, the leather they have on is now burning
behind them and is causing this glow in the alley.

02:00:33.820 --> 02:00:34.988
You see this, Percy.

02:00:34.988 --> 02:00:36.443
TALIESIN: How loud was this Fireball?

02:00:36.443 --> 02:00:38.067
MATT: It was pretty loud. It's a Fireball.

02:00:38.067 --> 02:00:39.555
TALIESIN: I'll take two shots at the two that came
through.

02:00:39.555 --> 02:00:40.651
MATT: Okay.

02:00:40.651 --> 02:00:41.961
MARISHA: We're here.

02:00:41.961 --> 02:00:44.858
TALIESIN: I'm going to curl up to the top and
upside-down, take two shots.

02:00:44.858 --> 02:00:45.893
MATT: Okay.

02:00:45.893 --> 02:00:47.531
JON: This is with your rifle?

02:00:47.531 --> 02:00:56.059
TALIESIN: Yeah, with my big rifle. That's not bad.
A 20 and a 27 to hit.

02:00:56.059 --> 02:00:57.010
MATT: Both hit.

02:00:57.010 --> 02:00:58.761
TALIESIN: Actually, even more than that.

02:00:58.761 --> 02:01:02.567
MATT: Don't even worry about rolling damage
because even your minimum damage, with what damage

02:01:02.567 --> 02:01:06.572
they'd taken from the Fireball? Both shots, you
hit them both in the ribcage, in the sternum and

02:01:06.572 --> 02:01:11.598
the back of the spinal column and they fold into
themselves and crumple into spinning pieces of

02:01:11.598 --> 02:01:16.619
bone. You watch as the momentum of their movement
causes them to scatter across the dust. Both of

02:01:16.619 --> 02:01:18.128
them. (gunshots)

02:01:18.128 --> 02:01:22.756
MARISHA: Hey, Pike? Hold that order for that
divine smiting. We're going to need it probably in

02:01:22.756 --> 02:01:24.138
a second.

02:01:24.138 --> 02:01:26.545
ASHLEY: I'm here. Did you save any for me?

02:01:26.545 --> 02:01:28.289
TALIESIN: There will be more.

02:01:28.289 --> 02:01:30.491
MARISHA: I think there's going to be more.

02:01:30.491 --> 02:01:32.124
ASHLEY: I take out my mace and get ready.

02:01:32.124 --> 02:01:33.593
JON: I want some now.

02:01:33.593 --> 02:01:42.443
MATT: All right, as you guys are waiting there...
30 seconds passes. 30 seconds pass. Scanlan, you

02:01:42.443 --> 02:01:47.614
finish your spell. The doorway appears up. There
doesn't appear to be anything else currently

02:01:47.614 --> 02:01:49.429
coming down the hall after you.

02:01:49.429 --> 02:01:51.737
LAURA: (singing) Scanlan, open the door.

02:01:51.737 --> 02:01:54.574
MARISHA: (singing) Scanlan, open the door.

02:01:54.574 --> 02:01:57.324
TRAVIS: We going in or what?

02:01:57.324 --> 02:01:59.260
LAURA: You guys want to camp? Let's go.

02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:03.500
TALIESIN: Can we leave something here? Is there
some sort of alarm that we can set?

02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:04.819
LAURA: Like a glyph?

02:02:04.819 --> 02:02:06.889
ASHLEY: A Glyph of Warding?

02:02:06.889 --> 02:02:08.801
TALIESIN: Like a Glyph of Warding.

02:02:08.801 --> 02:02:09.548
ASHLEY: Yes, we can.

02:02:09.548 --> 02:02:12.837
JON: Can you put it on the faces that already
exist so that they think--

02:02:12.837 --> 02:02:17.316
ASHLEY: Ooh. Chod!

02:02:17.316 --> 02:02:19.797
SAM: And an idiot shall lead them.

02:02:19.797 --> 02:02:21.596
JON: What's an idiot?

02:02:21.596 --> 02:02:24.488
LIAM: Broken clock. Twice a day. Well done.

02:02:24.488 --> 02:02:26.958
TALIESIN: Let's take a long rest and see if we can
get two more.

02:02:26.958 --> 02:02:33.928
MATT: You do notice, Keyleth, that the flickering
light, the firelight, is getting brighter. The

02:02:33.928 --> 02:02:37.985
firelight is now becoming more of a white light,
and it's a flickering white light.

02:02:37.985 --> 02:02:44.841
MARISHA: How hot does a campfire normally get? Not
that hot, right?

02:02:44.841 --> 02:02:46.844
LAURA: Not that hot.

02:02:46.844 --> 02:02:55.655
MARISHA: Oh no. Something bad. Hey, Pike? Fire.
Fire is very white. White fire.

02:02:55.655 --> 02:02:57.852
ASHLEY: Huh.

02:02:57.852 --> 02:03:01.382
LAURA: Feel like coming to the campsite? Maybe?

02:03:01.382 --> 02:03:03.020
TALIESIN: Let's start backing up.

02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:04.516
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Okay.

02:03:04.516 --> 02:03:06.472
MARISHA: Back up a little bit.

02:03:06.472 --> 02:03:10.453
ASHLEY: Are we close to the faces at all, still?

02:03:10.453 --> 02:03:14.333
MATT: You're maybe about 70 to 100 feet.

02:03:14.333 --> 02:03:15.667
ASHLEY: On the way back?

02:03:15.667 --> 02:03:18.620
MATT: You're backing up through a different
tunnel, so there's no faces

02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:20.165
that you've seen on this side.

02:03:20.165 --> 02:03:26.304
TALIESIN: Let's leave it at the shift, so if they
go up our tunnel, we'll know.

02:03:26.304 --> 02:03:28.953
ASHLEY: Great. I throw up a Glyph of Warding right
there.

02:03:28.953 --> 02:03:31.114
MATT: Glyph of Warding. What's the casting time on
the glyph?

02:03:31.114 --> 02:03:33.136
ASHLEY: A gift for someone.

02:03:33.136 --> 02:03:35.569
MATT: What's the casting time on the glyph?

02:03:35.569 --> 02:03:40.105
SAM: A gif of cording.

02:03:40.105 --> 02:03:41.599
MATT: Yes, that one.

02:03:41.599 --> 02:03:43.193
LAURA: We can't find the card.

02:03:43.193 --> 02:03:46.628
ASHLEY: Give me just one second. I don't know if
it slipped underneath.

02:03:46.628 --> 02:03:48.960
SAM: Probably a minute.

02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:51.877
TALIESIN: Everything fun takes a minute.

02:03:51.877 --> 02:03:55.696
MATT: All right. Glyph of Warding is one hour
casting time.

02:03:55.696 --> 02:03:57.035
TALIESIN: Oh, never mind!

02:03:57.035 --> 02:04:04.778
ASHLEY: You know what? We don't have time, so
maybe we can just hop into the mansion.

02:04:04.778 --> 02:04:07.862
TALIESIN: Watch an episode of House of Cards, and
by then Glyph of Warding will be done?

02:04:07.862 --> 02:04:10.307
LAURA: Keep an eye. Hop in the mansion?

02:04:10.307 --> 02:04:12.208
TALIESIN: Let's hop in the mansion.

02:04:12.208 --> 02:04:16.984
MATT: All right. You guys hop into the mansion.
You all make your way into the center of Scanlan's

02:04:16.984 --> 02:04:21.214
magnificent mansion. Lionel, you step through this
weird sparkling purple doorway that wasn't there

02:04:21.214 --> 02:04:25.673
before, and as you go through, the temperature
becomes very comfortable-warm. It's well-kept

02:04:25.673 --> 02:04:32.798
inside. It's climate-controlled. There's these
beautiful marble pillars. There's this royal red

02:04:32.798 --> 02:04:38.555
and gold carpet that spreads out over this dual
staircase that winds up to a second floor. It's a

02:04:38.555 --> 02:04:43.409
gorgeous mansion. The interior's immaculately
designed, and you watch as about a dozen or so

02:04:43.409 --> 02:04:47.971
spectral people suddenly float in with their arms
crossed and give a bow

02:04:47.971 --> 02:04:50.036
and a nod to you as you arrive.

02:04:50.036 --> 02:04:54.096
LAURA: Before we go in, will you throw down the
Dust of Tracelessness?

02:04:54.096 --> 02:04:55.282
TRAVIS: No.

02:04:55.282 --> 02:04:56.197
LAURA: Grog.

02:04:56.197 --> 02:04:57.161
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:04:57.161 --> 02:04:58.218
(laughter)

02:04:58.218 --> 02:05:00.903
MATT: All right. You guys are all inside the
mansion.

02:05:00.903 --> 02:05:04.341
LAURA: Well. That was fun.

02:05:04.341 --> 02:05:07.026
MARISHA: It's been a while. You've redecorated.

02:05:07.026 --> 02:05:14.166
SAM: I put some new art pieces in here. They're
all counterfeit, but still good.

02:05:14.166 --> 02:05:15.640
LIAM: How's the menu?

02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:17.252
SAM: The menu's changed quite a bit.

02:05:17.252 --> 02:05:18.969
TALIESIN: Oh, do tell.

02:05:18.969 --> 02:05:26.557
SAM: Kaylie got sick of chicken about two weeks
in, so she's got me on this vegan thing. (sighs)

02:05:26.557 --> 02:05:32.195
She says it'll make me last longer and feel
healthier and stuff.

02:05:32.195 --> 02:05:33.511
LAURA: Last longer?

02:05:33.511 --> 02:05:40.623
SAM: Well, you know. Live longer. She said all
that meat was probably bad for me, so it's all

02:05:40.623 --> 02:05:42.545
salads now.

02:05:42.701 --> 02:05:44.168
MARISHA: Only salads?

02:05:44.168 --> 02:05:45.925
SAM: Yeah. Different kinds of salad.

02:05:45.925 --> 02:05:47.399
LAURA: That's it? That's all they make, is salad?

02:05:47.399 --> 02:05:50.233
SAM: That's what she told them to make, and that's
what they're making now.

02:05:50.233 --> 02:05:52.605
LAURA: But you run the place.

02:05:52.605 --> 02:05:58.973
SAM: Well, I don't want to cross her. She has me
on a diet, and I'm trying to stick to it. It will

02:05:58.973 --> 02:06:01.155
be all salad.

02:06:01.155 --> 02:06:02.957
TALIESIN: Is it more tasteful in here now?

02:06:02.957 --> 02:06:04.249
SAM: Tasteful?

02:06:04.249 --> 02:06:05.904
TALIESIN: Is it more tasteful in the mansion?

02:06:05.904 --> 02:06:07.917
MATT: Is it more tasteful in the mansion? No, I
didn't think so.

02:06:07.917 --> 02:06:10.362
LAURA: Is the picture still up that Pike
commissioned?

02:06:10.362 --> 02:06:13.100
SAM: Yeah, sure. It's there.

02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:15.936
TRAVIS: You didn't replace that?

02:06:15.936 --> 02:06:23.911
SAM: Maybe we should all retire to our rooms for a
while and come back for dinner.

02:06:23.911 --> 02:06:30.098
LAURA: Is Tary-- does he have his own room, as
well?

02:06:30.098 --> 02:06:33.584
SAM: Oh, that's the fancy fellow you've brought
with you.

02:06:33.584 --> 02:06:35.815
LAURA: Yeah. Tary, Scanlan. Scanlan, Tary.

02:06:35.815 --> 02:06:37.106
SAM: The new Scanlan. Yeah, right.

02:06:37.106 --> 02:06:38.446
TRAVIS: Tary, say hi.

02:06:38.446 --> 02:06:44.698
SAM: Hello! I'm Taryon Darrington. I've been quite
pleased to spend some time with your friends for

02:06:44.698 --> 02:06:51.859
the last year, and it's-- you have wonderful
friends. You should honor and cherish them. They

02:06:51.859 --> 02:06:58.474
are the best people I've ever met in my life, and
this is a lovely home you have.

02:06:58.474 --> 02:07:01.297
TRAVIS: Scanlan, don't be rude. Respond.

02:07:01.297 --> 02:07:14.100
SAM: (sighs) It's nice to meet you, too. Thank you
for looking after my friends. I guess any friend

02:07:14.100 --> 02:07:19.732
of Vox Machina is a friend of mine. You can use
the downstairs. The basement room.

02:07:19.732 --> 02:07:23.253
LAURA: Scanlan, you can add a room at a thought!

02:07:23.253 --> 02:07:25.299
TALIESIN: He can have my room.

02:07:25.299 --> 02:07:27.403
LAURA: He can have your room.

02:07:27.403 --> 02:07:30.098
TALIESIN: That will be fine.

02:07:30.098 --> 02:07:32.665
JON: Do you have any bunkbeds?

02:07:32.665 --> 02:07:36.403
SAM: No. I don't have bunkbeds.

02:07:36.403 --> 02:07:37.707
JON: Do you have a hammock?

02:07:37.707 --> 02:07:42.744
SAM: No, I don't think I do, but there might be
some spare cots and stuff downstairs.

02:07:42.744 --> 02:07:45.749
TRAVIS: Lionel, there is a war room down in the
bottom of this bitch.

02:07:45.749 --> 02:07:47.066
JON: War room?

02:07:47.066 --> 02:07:51.002
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's got all the things people like
you and me need. We're covered.

02:07:51.002 --> 02:07:52.136
JON: Sweet.

02:07:52.136 --> 02:07:54.606
TRAVIS: Sand pit, fighting dummies.

02:07:54.606 --> 02:07:57.880
JON: Dibs on the sand pit.

02:07:57.880 --> 02:07:59.079
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:07:59.079 --> 02:08:00.847
(laughter)

02:08:00.847 --> 02:08:05.501
JON: It'll make me feel like I'm at home.

02:08:05.501 --> 02:08:08.383
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

02:08:08.383 --> 02:08:11.565
ASHLEY: There's also the spa, right?

02:08:11.565 --> 02:08:17.639
SAM: Yeah. It was destroyed but rebuilt. It's
lined with iron now,

02:08:17.639 --> 02:08:19.634
in case there's an explosion.

02:08:19.634 --> 02:08:21.752
LIAM: Wise.

02:08:21.752 --> 02:08:23.633
SAM: Yeah.

02:08:23.633 --> 02:08:28.024
MATT: Do you guys all scatter to your rooms for a
moment to take a rest?

02:08:28.024 --> 02:08:29.790
LAURA: I guess so.

02:08:29.790 --> 02:08:31.428
LIAM: Do you want to play some cards or
something?

02:08:31.428 --> 02:08:33.177
SAM: Sure! That will be great.

02:08:33.177 --> 02:08:35.395
LIAM: Want to go back to, what, your room?

02:08:35.395 --> 02:08:38.464
SAM: That will be fine, yeah. Let's go.

02:08:38.464 --> 02:08:44.839
MATT: All righty. You guys head back to Scanlan's
room? We're going to take a break here. We'll

02:08:44.839 --> 02:08:49.468
return here and pick up from that exact moment
here, in just a few minutes. Real fast, we do have

02:08:49.468 --> 02:08:59.304
a Wyrmwood giveaway. It is the black walnut
complete dice tower system and tabletop dice tray

02:08:59.304 --> 02:09:01.519
with leather rolling surface.

02:09:01.519 --> 02:09:03.598
LAURA: Should we open it and see what color that
is?

02:09:03.598 --> 02:09:05.548
MATT: I'll open some of it. I'm not going to open
all of it.

02:09:05.548 --> 02:09:07.194
LAURA: Just one, because it's all black walnut.

02:09:07.194 --> 02:09:19.330
MATT: Black walnut is this really nice dark color.
The leather interior is really nice. This will be

02:09:19.330 --> 02:09:29.942
going to the person who wins in the Twitch chat.
Enter the code "hundred." The word "hundred" is

02:09:29.942 --> 02:09:33.195
the code for the evening. Put it in there. Good
luck to whoever wins, and we'll see you guys back

02:09:33.195 --> 02:09:34.472
here in a few minutes.

02:09:34.472 --> 02:09:36.078
(cheering)

02:09:36.078 --> 02:31:40.908
[break]

02:31:41.047 --> 02:31:44.412
MATT: And welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to
Critical Role. First and foremost, we have our

02:31:44.412 --> 02:31:52.011
winner in the chat: AJSparks08, congratulations,
you won the fantastic Wyrmwood package. Denovo

02:31:52.011 --> 02:31:55.162
will contact you shortly to get your address and
shipping information. Congratulations, on our

02:31:55.162 --> 02:32:00.462
100th episode Wyrmwood giveaway! Also, it's come
to our attention that the chat room and the

02:32:00.462 --> 02:32:05.186
Internet is convinced that this is not a real set
and we are apparently on a green screen, so I

02:32:05.186 --> 02:32:13.546
wanted to show you guys how incredibly real this
-- no, I'm kidding, it's actually real. It's a

02:32:13.546 --> 02:32:20.125
real set, it's actually here. It's a real set.

02:32:20.125 --> 02:32:22.967
LAURA: Don't fuck up the wrinkles, they look so
good in the light!

02:32:22.967 --> 02:32:28.968
MATT: But I do understand illusions are prominent
in magical realms, apparently.

02:32:28.968 --> 02:32:32.556
TRAVIS: Because of the beautiful spot behind you,
can you give us one Vidal Sassoon wave of your--

02:32:32.556 --> 02:32:34.114
LAURA: Yeah, because you have a backlight!

02:32:34.114 --> 02:32:34.787
MATT: No.

02:32:34.787 --> 02:32:36.571
LAURA: And a halo around you, because of the
shield!

02:32:36.571 --> 02:32:39.450
TRAVIS: It's kind of magnificent. Yeah!

02:32:39.450 --> 02:32:42.287
MATT: I hate you all so much.

02:32:42.287 --> 02:32:44.476
LAURA: Now your hair is extra fluffy because you
did it.

02:32:44.476 --> 02:32:48.404
MATT: God damn it. All right! Why do I listen to
these people?

02:32:48.532 --> 02:32:51.098
SAM: Maybe he's born with it.

02:32:51.098 --> 02:32:52.942
JON: Maybe it's--

02:32:52.942 --> 02:32:59.807
MATT: "Tary?" All right, so leaving us back where
we left off, you guys had all scattered to your

02:32:59.807 --> 02:33:04.191
various rooms in Scanlan's magnificent mansion.
Vax, you had gone off with Scanlan?

02:33:04.191 --> 02:33:06.439
LIAM: Catch up, play cards.

02:33:06.439 --> 02:33:09.366
MATT: All right, so you make your way to the
chambers.

02:33:09.366 --> 02:33:13.896
LIAM: Boy, it is more extravagant in here than I
remember.

02:33:13.896 --> 02:33:17.068
SAM: Well, to be fair, you hadn't spent a lot of
time in my room.

02:33:17.068 --> 02:33:20.329
LIAM: No, but there was just one mirror on the
ceiling, and now there are three.

02:33:20.329 --> 02:33:22.298
SAM: I need to get every angle, don't I?

02:33:22.298 --> 02:33:26.265
LIAM: Yeah, that's weird. Do you want to play
cards?

02:33:26.265 --> 02:33:29.347
SAM: Sure. Rummy gin? Gin rummy? Pinochle?

02:33:29.347 --> 02:33:30.925
LIAM: Yeah, I'll pretend to know what those are.

02:33:30.925 --> 02:33:32.335
SAM: Spades? Hearts?

02:33:32.335 --> 02:33:33.748
LIAM: Let's do hearts.

02:33:33.748 --> 02:33:36.878
SAM: Okay. I'll deal.

02:33:36.878 --> 02:33:42.233
LIAM: Okay. No idea how to play this game. But Vax
does!

02:33:42.233 --> 02:33:43.740
SAM: I will win.

02:33:43.740 --> 02:33:47.555
LIAM: All right, so catch me up, man!

02:33:47.555 --> 02:33:52.697
SAM: I mean, there's a lot to talk about in a
year. We--

02:33:52.697 --> 02:33:58.435
LIAM: What happened in the beginning? What
happened right after you left?

02:33:58.435 --> 02:34:00.102
First couple of weeks?

02:34:00.102 --> 02:34:11.330
SAM: We went on sort of a walkabout. Me and Kaylie
went off to the woods, did some camping. We found

02:34:11.330 --> 02:34:21.955
some travelers and sang to them, and told stories
like we do. Entertained some folks. Some nights

02:34:21.955 --> 02:34:27.222
were spent alone, some nights in the company of
people who wandered by. We weren't too far away

02:34:27.222 --> 02:34:28.725
from Whitestone.

02:34:28.725 --> 02:34:31.242
LIAM: So how did you get to Marquet?

02:34:31.242 --> 02:34:47.454
SAM: After about a month or two of being hobos, I
guess, she wanted to do something. You know,

02:34:47.454 --> 02:34:56.223
anything. She was getting bored, she's young. So I
told her, I don't really have anywhere to go, but

02:34:56.223 --> 02:35:03.945
I do know of two fuckfaces I have to get revenge
on. I asked her if she'd be interested in that,

02:35:03.945 --> 02:35:15.918
and she said, fuck yeah! So she came down with me.
We got a boat, went across the sea, and we went

02:35:15.918 --> 02:35:23.189
back to that casino. It was really the only piece
of unfinished business from our time together that

02:35:23.189 --> 02:35:24.505
I had to deal with.

02:35:24.505 --> 02:35:28.501
LIAM: And that somehow stumbled into all this?

02:35:28.501 --> 02:35:40.529
SAM: Well, when I got my revenge on them, I
learned a bit about what they were up to. They

02:35:40.529 --> 02:35:49.241
weren't really drug dealers. It's embarrassing,
but the drugs they sold me were not real. I know

02:35:49.241 --> 02:35:54.025
that's hard to believe, but I was swindled by
them.

02:35:54.025 --> 02:35:59.041
LIAM: That is hard to believe. I don't think it's
true.

02:35:59.041 --> 02:36:01.978
SAM: It is true. They sold me a bunch of shit.

02:36:01.978 --> 02:36:04.007
LIAM: Oh, surely not, no.

02:36:04.007 --> 02:36:17.711
SAM: But they were in this other game, of selling
counterfeit stuff. So I did the thing that I knew

02:36:17.711 --> 02:36:24.876
would hurt them most. I took away their
counterfeiter, and now he works for me. So I put

02:36:24.876 --> 02:36:36.218
them out of business, and I put me into business.
And since then I've been doing that for a while,

02:36:36.218 --> 02:36:39.482
and it turns out I'm very good at it.

02:36:39.482 --> 02:36:42.048
LIAM: That actually is not surprising.

02:36:42.048 --> 02:36:51.050
SAM: We don't try to swindle people who are
innocent. We started off by taking down-- well,

02:36:51.050 --> 02:37:01.398
not taking down, but ripping off a few guys who
were corrupt officials in the city, and built from

02:37:01.398 --> 02:37:06.715
there. It's not a big operation, if I can be
honest with you. It's just me and Kaylie

02:37:06.715 --> 02:37:08.156
and a few other people.

02:37:08.156 --> 02:37:11.206
LIAM: I mean, I'm not going to lie, I think it's
pretty cool.

02:37:11.206 --> 02:37:19.723
SAM: Thank you. It is kind of cool. I have this
persona, and people know who it is, and when I go

02:37:19.723 --> 02:37:22.618
places, they're scared of me a little bit.

02:37:22.618 --> 02:37:26.888
LIAM: I mean, you did save a fucking continent,
you are scary.

02:37:26.888 --> 02:37:28.772
SAM: That's true.

02:37:28.772 --> 02:37:30.214
LIAM: It is true.

02:37:30.214 --> 02:37:33.057
SAM: I helped, a bit.

02:37:33.057 --> 02:37:37.768
LIAM: A bit? You've had a year to clear your head,
you think it was just a bit?

02:37:37.768 --> 02:37:43.438
SAM: I don't know, maybe. We all did our part. We
all did our part!

02:37:43.438 --> 02:37:47.735
LIAM: You know there are multiple times we'd all
be dead if it weren't for you. You know that. You

02:37:47.735 --> 02:37:54.843
know that! And the same could be said for any of
us, that's true, but you take any one piece away,

02:37:54.843 --> 02:37:58.871
and the tower falls. Jenga, man.

02:37:58.871 --> 02:38:12.287
SAM: I don't know what that game is. But, I know,
I know. Listen, I did a lot of thinking over the

02:38:12.287 --> 02:38:24.328
year, and I-- Yeah. I appreciate you all much more
now than I did, and I realize that you probably

02:38:24.328 --> 02:38:33.326
appreciated me, too, but at the time I just didn't
know. I was so used to being a loner that I didn't

02:38:33.326 --> 02:38:39.797
know really how to behave in a group, that's all.
So I left.

02:38:39.797 --> 02:38:51.116
LIAM: You know, it was ugly, on all sides, when
you left, but I've always understood why you left.

02:38:51.116 --> 02:38:52.607
I admire it.

02:38:52.607 --> 02:38:54.350
SAM: Really?

02:38:54.350 --> 02:39:11.607
LIAM: I wish my dad gave half as much effort as
you have this year. Or I used to. Anyway, you

02:39:11.607 --> 02:39:14.557
know, we've missed you. Everybody has.

02:39:14.557 --> 02:39:15.880
SAM: That's not true.

02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:27.231
LIAM: It is true. And I certainly have, and if I
did anything or said anything to make you feel

02:39:27.231 --> 02:39:33.778
lonely, I'm sorry. I really am. Fucking missed
you, man.

02:39:33.778 --> 02:39:47.004
SAM: You don't have to apologize for anything. It
was me. It was me, and I don't know if we'll ever

02:39:47.004 --> 02:40:00.495
have what we had before, but I can tell you that
fighting alongside you all was the best time of my

02:40:00.495 --> 02:40:08.419
life, and not because of the glory, or the
fortune, or the fame that we got. It was just to

02:40:08.419 --> 02:40:17.645
fight alongside you, and to see the looks on your
faces when I did something really cool in battle.

02:40:17.645 --> 02:40:25.534
LIAM: Fucking every time. I know I miss that
flair.

02:40:25.534 --> 02:40:31.272
SAM: But you've got this new guy, and he seems
really-- He's very handsome.

02:40:31.272 --> 02:40:36.851
LIAM: Well, I don't know. Yeah, he's good looking.
That's true. I don't know that we have-- I mean,

02:40:36.851 --> 02:40:39.920
we've scattered a bit. I live in Zephra now.

02:40:39.920 --> 02:40:41.542
SAM: Oh, really?

02:40:41.542 --> 02:40:43.037
LIAM: I'm on holiday, yeah.

02:40:43.037 --> 02:40:44.080
SAM: Zephra Heights?

02:40:44.080 --> 02:40:49.496
LIAM: Pretty much, yeah. It's all Zephra Heights.
No, I'm very happy right now.

02:40:49.496 --> 02:40:53.483
SAM: You are happy?

02:40:53.483 --> 02:40:54.929
LIAM: Yeah.

02:40:54.929 --> 02:40:56.462
SAM: That's so weird.

02:40:56.462 --> 02:40:58.504
LIAM: I know. I was happy for a long time.

02:40:58.504 --> 02:41:01.429
SAM: But still with the black. You're not giving
that up.

02:41:01.429 --> 02:41:05.715
LIAM: I mean, this is, no! This is part of the
bargain.

02:41:05.715 --> 02:41:08.230
SAM: I mean, some turquoise could pop it up a
little bit.

02:41:08.230 --> 02:41:11.129
LIAM: Yeah, but you know I have sunshine in my
life every day, so it's all right.

02:41:11.129 --> 02:41:13.075
SAM: That's true. How's that all going?

02:41:13.075 --> 02:41:16.776
LIAM: Fucking the best, man! It's the fucking
best!

02:41:16.776 --> 02:41:18.232
SAM: Yeah?

02:41:18.232 --> 02:41:29.287
LIAM: Yeah. But, you know, all I care about is
that you're happier now than you were. You seem a

02:41:29.287 --> 02:41:31.023
little happier.

02:41:31.023 --> 02:41:39.597
SAM: I'm certainly better off than I was when I
left you all. I don't know that I'm happier, just

02:41:39.597 --> 02:41:41.699
better off.

02:41:41.699 --> 02:41:47.345
LIAM: Well, that's a step up. And Kaylie, is she
better off?

02:41:47.345 --> 02:41:48.820
SAM: Most certainly.

02:41:48.820 --> 02:41:50.394
LIAM: Well, that's great.

02:41:50.394 --> 02:41:57.401
SAM: Listen, thank you for coming up here and
stuff. I don't really know

02:41:57.401 --> 02:41:59.006
what to do with the others.

02:41:59.006 --> 02:42:14.742
LIAM: Well, again, a lot of hard shit was said on
your way out, in many directions, and the way I

02:42:14.742 --> 02:42:22.451
look at it, it's to be expected. We went through
hell together, that's going to have an effect. But

02:42:22.451 --> 02:42:32.820
even the ones who are angry at you, they did miss
you. And family doesn't break apart that easy.

02:42:32.820 --> 02:42:38.520
Don't scare away. Just be patient.

02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:41.569
SAM: I'll try.

02:42:41.569 --> 02:42:46.919
LIAM: Clap him on the back of the head.

02:42:46.919 --> 02:42:48.378
SAM: I can't reach.

02:42:48.378 --> 02:42:51.316
LIAM: I can. I love you, man.

02:42:51.316 --> 02:42:55.246
SAM: You too. I'm sorry.

02:42:55.246 --> 02:43:01.184
LIAM: It's good to see you.

02:43:01.184 --> 02:43:03.606
SAM: We're not going to play cards, are we?

02:43:03.606 --> 02:43:08.046
LIAM: I don't know how to play this game.

02:43:08.046 --> 02:43:09.536
SAM: Yeah, okay.

02:43:09.536 --> 02:43:11.621
LIAM: But thanks for the conversation.

02:43:11.621 --> 02:43:12.913
SAM: Sure.

02:43:12.913 --> 02:43:15.432
LIAM: That's been about an hour, I think.

02:43:15.432 --> 02:43:16.932
SAM: Yeah, you should just go.

02:43:16.932 --> 02:43:18.753
LIAM: Yeah.

02:43:18.753 --> 02:43:21.058
SAM: I mean, yeah.

02:43:21.058 --> 02:43:23.754
LIAM: I walk away.

02:43:23.754 --> 02:43:31.807
MATT: All righty. All right. If anyone else wants
to do anything else before dinner, or after?

02:43:31.807 --> 02:43:38.039
MARISHA: I take all the mirrors off the roof of
our bedroom while he talks with Scanlan, and then

02:43:38.039 --> 02:43:40.117
we go to sleep.

02:43:40.117 --> 02:43:42.359
MATT: There are mirrors in yours as well?

02:43:42.359 --> 02:43:43.227
MARISHA: I assume.

02:43:43.227 --> 02:43:49.308
SAM: I hadn't intended on it, but there's
definitely a mirror in there.

02:43:49.308 --> 02:43:59.130
MATT: All right. Your wonderful exposé on salad
types are presented to you by the spectral

02:43:59.130 --> 02:44:04.219
servants. A fantastic dinner of greens of all
shades--

02:44:04.219 --> 02:44:05.717
TRAVIS: Where's the meat?

02:44:05.717 --> 02:44:09.355
SAM: There's lima beans.

02:44:09.355 --> 02:44:15.088
TALIESIN: Do they serve meat for guests, or is it
just Scanlan that's barred?

02:44:15.088 --> 02:44:17.767
LIAM: Not even chicken salad in this mansion?

02:44:17.767 --> 02:44:21.624
SAM: No, the closest we have is lima beans.

02:44:21.624 --> 02:44:25.364
LAURA: They know how to make chicken, though, I
know the servants know how to make chicken!

02:44:25.364 --> 02:44:30.068
SAM: If I have them make chicken, they'll tell
her, and I'll get in trouble.

02:44:30.068 --> 02:44:31.569
TALIESIN: Tell her you didn't have any.

02:44:31.569 --> 02:44:35.786
TRAVIS: That's true. I have an idea. Bring me a
cow. No, I'm kidding.

02:44:35.786 --> 02:44:38.415
MATT: The spectral servant's like--

02:44:38.415 --> 02:44:40.231
SAM: Don't do it.

02:44:40.231 --> 02:44:42.661
TRAVIS: It worked once before.

02:44:42.661 --> 02:44:47.228
SAM: Listen. They make a great cucumber salad.
They've got an excellent endive.

02:44:47.228 --> 02:44:48.781
TRAVIS: What?

02:44:48.781 --> 02:44:50.002
LAURA: Fabulous.

02:44:50.002 --> 02:44:56.710
SAM: A couscous. And a tabbouleh.

02:44:56.710 --> 02:44:59.898
ASHLEY: So, basically, it's one of those meals
that you're still hungry when you eat it all.

02:44:59.898 --> 02:45:02.658
SAM: Yeah, it's really not filling at all. It's
terrible.

02:45:02.658 --> 02:45:05.094
MATT: And he's not lying.

02:45:05.094 --> 02:45:07.037
TALIESIN: Do we lose hit points from this meal?

02:45:07.037 --> 02:45:11.971
LAURA: Oh, shit, did we say that we have to buy
chalices before we have any more fucking feasts?

02:45:11.971 --> 02:45:12.945
MATT: Yes.

02:45:12.945 --> 02:45:14.289
LAURA: Shit balls.

02:45:14.289 --> 02:45:15.784
LIAM: Said Vex.

02:45:15.784 --> 02:45:18.541
LAURA: We're out of chalices!

02:45:18.541 --> 02:45:21.508
ASHLEY: Do we have any chalices in here?

02:45:21.508 --> 02:45:23.434
SAM: For what?

02:45:23.434 --> 02:45:31.080
MATT: They're referring to the Heroes' Feast meal,
but no. Stuff like that, you stock up on.

02:45:31.080 --> 02:45:32.897
LAURA: We've got to remember. We've got to do it.

02:45:32.897 --> 02:45:45.095
MATT: All right. So the meal is filling to varying
degrees of enjoyment, but you find rest at your

02:45:45.095 --> 02:45:48.922
disposal. Relatively early into your day, though
it is night in Ank'harel. You guys have been awake

02:45:48.922 --> 02:45:53.444
for approximately five hours. Do you go to rest?

02:45:53.444 --> 02:45:58.540
SAM: I mean, if we all rest, when we wake up,
those things are gonna be

02:45:58.540 --> 02:46:00.202
swarming outside the door, right?

02:46:00.202 --> 02:46:05.171
LAURA: Yes, potentially, or they could have given
up. What if we just peek out the door and see?

02:46:05.171 --> 02:46:06.309
SAM: We can do that.

02:46:06.309 --> 02:46:08.290
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to peek out the door.

02:46:08.290 --> 02:46:09.726
MATT: Okay.

02:46:09.726 --> 02:46:16.046
LAURA: Very stealthily open the door a little bit
and see. Yeah, I'm going to stay inside the door

02:46:16.046 --> 02:46:17.467
but just look outside the door.

02:46:17.467 --> 02:46:24.941
MATT: You peek outside the door, and right as you
glance through, you see about 13 or so skeletons

02:46:24.941 --> 02:46:28.092
that are all clustered right there at the door
going (zombie groans).

02:46:28.092 --> 02:46:30.225
LAURA: Ah, fuck. Shut it.

02:46:30.225 --> 02:46:31.952
TALIESIN: I feel like that can wait till morning.

02:46:31.952 --> 02:46:37.323
LAURA: I think it might keep getting worse, I'm
not sure.

02:46:37.323 --> 02:46:38.578
SAM: Maybe we should sleep.

02:46:38.578 --> 02:46:40.282
LIAM: We wait till morning and we throw Pike out
the door.

02:46:40.282 --> 02:46:41.778
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's fine. I'll volunteer.

02:46:41.778 --> 02:46:43.769
JON: Can they come into this magic door?

02:46:43.769 --> 02:46:45.082
SAM: No, they have to be invited.

02:46:45.082 --> 02:46:46.951
JON: They can't? Are they vampires?

02:46:46.951 --> 02:46:49.137
LIAM: They're all bones.

02:46:49.137 --> 02:46:52.376
JON: Okay. So we're okay. They can't come in.

02:46:52.376 --> 02:46:53.387
SAM: For a while.

02:46:53.387 --> 02:46:55.779
JON: Is there a back door to this place?

02:46:55.779 --> 02:46:56.959
SAM: Oh, no.

02:46:56.959 --> 02:47:01.786
JON: So if we wake up in the morning and there's
200 of them, then--

02:47:01.786 --> 02:47:03.315
SAM: We're fucked.

02:47:03.315 --> 02:47:08.986
MARISHA: We're okay. We have Pike.

02:47:08.986 --> 02:47:10.562
TALIESIN: We have options.

02:47:10.562 --> 02:47:12.164
JON: What's Pike going to do?

02:47:12.164 --> 02:47:18.519
ASHLEY: Undead is my favored terrain.

02:47:18.519 --> 02:47:21.205
JON: Are you going to talk to them?

02:47:21.205 --> 02:47:23.991
ASHLEY: I could. But what's the point?

02:47:23.991 --> 02:47:26.306
JON: Well, maybe they have secrets.

02:47:26.306 --> 02:47:28.816
Do you have Commune with Skeletons?

02:47:28.816 --> 02:47:30.670
MARISHA: Not all skeletons are like ducks.

02:47:30.670 --> 02:47:33.736
LAURA: Yeah, some of them are a lot meaner.

02:47:33.736 --> 02:47:37.526
ASHLEY: If we find your friends, I can talk to
them if they're dead.

02:47:37.526 --> 02:47:42.005
JON: Maybe they're unhappy with their employer.
Maybe we can find their good side.

02:47:42.005 --> 02:47:45.159
LAURA: We could turn some undead.

02:47:45.159 --> 02:47:47.020
ASHLEY: That's not a bad idea.

02:47:47.020 --> 02:47:50.961
JON: I'm sorry, I never talk so much. I'm just
really hungry after that stupid meal.

02:47:50.961 --> 02:47:53.981
ASHLEY: Same, it's okay. I feel starving.

02:47:53.981 --> 02:47:55.473
TALIESIN: Let's have a nightcap.

02:47:55.473 --> 02:47:57.018
SAM: They can make you a fruit smoothie.

02:47:57.018 --> 02:48:00.379
LAURA: Yes. I want that. I do want it. Yes. Bring
it.

02:48:00.379 --> 02:48:01.993
TALIESIN: That may be breakfast.

02:48:01.993 --> 02:48:03.499
TRAVIS: That'll give you the runs, you don't want
that.

02:48:03.499 --> 02:48:05.072
MARISHA: Can we put some rum in it?

02:48:05.072 --> 02:48:10.806
ASHLEY: Can you have eggs, or is that not vegan?

02:48:10.806 --> 02:48:13.876
SAM: She said vegan. No eggs.

02:48:13.876 --> 02:48:15.775
LAURA: This fucking sucks.

02:48:15.775 --> 02:48:19.737
TALIESIN: A shallow ghost of a dinner served by
shallow ghosts of people. I'm ready for a

02:48:19.737 --> 02:48:21.557
nightcap, and an end of the evening.

02:48:21.557 --> 02:48:32.254
MATT: So you pull out the various bottles you've
stored amongst Grog's Bag of Holding. Scatter a

02:48:32.254 --> 02:48:34.992
nightcap amongst those who wish to partake, and
find yourself resting

02:48:34.992 --> 02:48:36.584
for the evening within the mansion.

02:48:36.584 --> 02:48:38.168
TALIESIN: To a death in the morning.

02:48:38.168 --> 02:48:39.763
MARISHA: To a pina colada.

02:48:39.763 --> 02:48:42.540
LAURA: As we're walking towards the rooms, can I
pull Pike aside for a second?

02:48:42.540 --> 02:48:44.383
MATT: Sure. So as you guys are heading off--

02:48:44.383 --> 02:48:47.577
LAURA: How are you?

02:48:47.577 --> 02:48:59.002
ASHLEY: Well, I'm fine. I'm just finding myself a
little angry.

02:48:59.002 --> 02:49:01.183
LAURA: Well, I think it's reasonable to be angry.

02:49:01.183 --> 02:49:02.711
ASHLEY: And I'm trying not to be.

02:49:02.711 --> 02:49:04.148
LAURA: It's a different side of you.

02:49:04.148 --> 02:49:10.743
ASHLEY: I know. I don't like it. But I can't help
it. What should I do?

02:49:10.743 --> 02:49:20.872
LAURA: Well. Your emotions are justified. But you
found it in your heart to forgive your family, and

02:49:20.872 --> 02:49:30.246
they did terrible things to you. Maybe it's harder
with people that are closer. They cut deeper.

02:49:30.246 --> 02:49:42.384
ASHLEY: Yeah. I think it's just because I didn't
really know them. Maybe it was easier to just let

02:49:42.384 --> 02:49:48.092
them go, and I wasn't as angry as I am with him.

02:49:48.092 --> 02:49:50.861
LAURA: Have you talked to Sarenrae about it?

02:49:50.861 --> 02:49:59.565
ASHLEY: No. I'm just nervous. I know what she'll
say, and have me do, and I just want to be--

02:49:59.565 --> 02:50:01.325
LAURA: You don't want to do it yet.

02:50:01.325 --> 02:50:10.117
ASHLEY: I don't want to do it! I just want to be
mad for a while, I guess, but... I don't know. I

02:50:10.117 --> 02:50:18.574
guess just seeing him again. Slowly but surely,
I'm not as mad, but--

02:50:18.574 --> 02:50:20.309
LAURA: He's still charming.

02:50:20.309 --> 02:50:26.261
ASHLEY: I know, I just feel like now I'm acting
like I'm mad, almost, around him. I don't know.

02:50:26.261 --> 02:50:34.288
He's making me feel so many different kinds of
emotions. I'm confused.

02:50:34.288 --> 02:50:45.854
LAURA: I don't know what tomorrow will bring.
Probably a battle of some sort, which is usually

02:50:45.854 --> 02:50:56.844
life-endangering. Just ask yourself if you would
want to die without saying how you feel.

02:50:56.844 --> 02:51:12.549
ASHLEY: Okay. That's a good idea. I would feel
very bad if something happened to him and I didn't

02:51:12.549 --> 02:51:16.516
say anything. I mean, if I died, then I just
wouldn't know, I guess.

02:51:16.516 --> 02:51:20.816
LAURA: You'd know a few minutes later when we
tried to bring you back.

02:51:20.816 --> 02:51:23.520
I just spit on you, I'm sorry.

02:51:23.520 --> 02:51:32.391
ASHLEY: It's fine, I don't care. Okay. Well,
that's true. Thank you.

02:51:32.391 --> 02:51:34.208
LAURA: It's hard.

02:51:34.208 --> 02:51:36.206
ASHLEY: I know. It is hard.

02:51:36.206 --> 02:51:42.480
LAURA: Well, you know, if you feel like staying up
and wandering around and talking to some people--

02:51:42.480 --> 02:51:47.123
TALIESIN: I come running up. No, now. We're going.
Good night. Good night! Now! Now.

02:51:47.123 --> 02:51:48.661
No more. Good night!

02:51:48.661 --> 02:51:49.926
ASHLEY: Well, good night.

02:51:49.926 --> 02:51:51.062
TALIESIN: Good night!

02:51:51.062 --> 02:51:56.112
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, good night, you two.

02:51:56.112 --> 02:51:58.017
LAURA: We haven't been here in a while.

02:51:58.017 --> 02:52:02.833
TALIESIN: I know. I kind of want to break a few
things. You've earned it, fucker.

02:52:02.833 --> 02:52:15.462
ASHLEY: I go and I knock on Grog's door.

02:52:15.462 --> 02:52:21.873
MATT: Okay. Grog doesn't have a door, Grog is
currently staying in the war room area.

02:52:21.873 --> 02:52:23.318
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right.

02:52:23.318 --> 02:52:30.803
MATT: So as you head down, you see, curled up on
the sand pit, this half-orc snoring loudly, like a

02:52:30.803 --> 02:52:38.275
golden retriever that had rotated twice and passed
out in the sand. Grog, what are you doing?

02:52:38.275 --> 02:52:42.690
TRAVIS: I'm like the dog that's staring at the cat
that stole its fucking bed.

02:52:42.690 --> 02:52:48.108
JON: Can't argue with the dibs policy.

02:52:48.108 --> 02:52:52.791
TRAVIS: It's supreme. It's absolute. It's binding
in all planes.

02:52:52.791 --> 02:52:58.931
JON: All barbarians understand it. It's the law.

02:52:58.931 --> 02:53:04.200
ASHLEY: I stand next to him and stare at Chod--
Lionel in the sand pit.

02:53:04.200 --> 02:53:11.415
TRAVIS: This is bullshit, right? Everything I had,
everything I was, right there. Just another one.

02:53:11.415 --> 02:53:25.800
ASHLEY: Grog, I know that you probably feel
replaced, but there's

02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:28.015
no way he could fill your shoes.

02:53:28.015 --> 02:53:33.879
TRAVIS: I mean, he's big! Look at those feet! It's
like clown feet! I bet he's a great swimmer.

02:53:33.879 --> 02:53:40.833
ASHLEY: He could-- I mean, but his feet are a
little bit too big, you know.

02:53:40.833 --> 02:53:42.247
TRAVIS: Yeah, too big.

02:53:42.247 --> 02:53:43.511
ASHLEY: Your feet are just right.

02:53:43.511 --> 02:53:45.179
TRAVIS: Right. Mm-hm.

02:53:45.179 --> 02:53:53.370
ASHLEY: I have an idea. How about we go get a
bunch of blankets, the ones out of my room. We'll

02:53:53.370 --> 02:53:56.728
just make a fort by the fireplace. We'll make a
better spot.

02:53:56.728 --> 02:54:00.547
TRAVIS: A new spot. Yeah, okay.

02:54:00.547 --> 02:54:14.780
ASHLEY: I just talked to Vex, and she said that
maybe if something were to happen tomorrow, maybe

02:54:14.780 --> 02:54:20.455
it would be better to just say some things, so
that you're not, you know,

02:54:20.455 --> 02:54:22.529
thinking about it if somebody dies.

02:54:22.529 --> 02:54:24.205
TRAVIS: Is somebody dying tomorrow?

02:54:24.205 --> 02:54:26.037
ASHLEY: No.

02:54:26.037 --> 02:54:29.824
TRAVIS: Are you going to die? Pike, you mean the
world to me. Listen, I couldn't go on--

02:54:29.824 --> 02:54:33.000
ASHLEY: I'll be fine, I promise. Just, I guess,
Scanlan.

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:34.902
TRAVIS: What?

02:54:34.902 --> 02:54:37.344
ASHLEY: Maybe, do you feel like you want to talk
to him?

02:54:37.344 --> 02:54:40.419
TRAVIS: No! Yes. No!

02:54:40.419 --> 02:54:52.197
ASHLEY: I think I'm angry with him, but I can tell
you're also angry with him.

02:54:52.197 --> 02:54:53.531
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:54:53.531 --> 02:54:56.161
ASHLEY: So I'll stay mad at him as long as you
are.

02:54:56.161 --> 02:54:58.774
TRAVIS: Really?

02:54:58.774 --> 02:55:06.731
ASHLEY: But I feel like maybe he feels a little
bad.

02:55:06.731 --> 02:55:16.421
TRAVIS: Are you sure? I can't tell. He changed the
inside of the mansion. He's got a new dog sleeping

02:55:16.421 --> 02:55:22.014
in the sandpit. He called him his best man. You
heard it. I did.

02:55:22.014 --> 02:55:25.319
ASHLEY: That was weird.

02:55:25.319 --> 02:55:27.916
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's fucked up, is what it was.

02:55:27.916 --> 02:55:32.736
ASHLEY: Well, you know what we should do? We
should just tomorrow--

02:55:32.736 --> 02:55:33.839
TRAVIS: Kill him.

02:55:33.839 --> 02:55:50.841
ASHLEY: That's definitely an option, but I feel
like maybe we could just try to be better than

02:55:50.841 --> 02:55:58.278
him. Maybe you could really show off, and show him
that you are better, and that we're better, and

02:55:58.278 --> 02:56:04.919
we're better friends, and you know, that he should
come back and hang out with us.

02:56:04.919 --> 02:56:10.501
TRAVIS: Yeah! No, I like this idea. This is really
something we can roll with! Yeah! He should miss

02:56:10.501 --> 02:56:17.333
us! In fact, he should be coming to beg us to be
like, I miss you! You're so cool!

02:56:17.333 --> 02:56:18.588
ASHLEY: He should!

02:56:18.588 --> 02:56:20.163
TRAVIS: Yeah! We've got to make him remember.

02:56:20.163 --> 02:56:22.127
ASHLEY: We've got to make him remember.

02:56:22.127 --> 02:56:23.140
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:56:23.140 --> 02:56:25.793
ASHLEY: We've got to make him remember how great
we are and what he's lost.

02:56:25.793 --> 02:56:32.042
TRAVIS: Yeah. So tomorrow, all the tricks out the
bag, throw caution to the wind,

02:56:32.042 --> 02:56:35.061
you and me, it's a show.

02:56:35.061 --> 02:56:36.233
ASHLEY: All the tricks.

02:56:36.233 --> 02:56:37.184
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:56:37.184 --> 02:56:41.794
JON: I suddenly wake up. You guys, I'm used to
sleeping alone. You guys are talking so much.

02:56:41.794 --> 02:56:44.518
ASHLEY: Oh, sorry, we didn't realize you were
awake.

02:56:44.518 --> 02:56:48.474
TRAVIS: Just roll over. If you pile the sand up,
you make little earmuffs.

02:56:48.474 --> 02:56:52.166
JON: It's not working, I'm used to silence, and
you guys are like two alarms.

02:56:52.166 --> 02:56:54.490
TRAVIS: We're going to go. We go make a blanket
fort.

02:56:54.490 --> 02:56:56.090
ASHLEY: We make a blanket fort by the fireplace.

02:56:56.090 --> 02:56:57.102
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:56:57.102 --> 02:56:59.150
JON: Thank you!

02:56:59.150 --> 02:57:07.171
MATT: All right. As you guys go make a blanket
fort, curl up and sleep takes you. The next

02:57:07.171 --> 02:57:10.603
morning, you come to consciousness, are greeted
with a fantastic,

02:57:10.603 --> 02:57:13.837
spiritually brought, vegan breakfast.

02:57:13.837 --> 02:57:18.303
LAURA: Ooh, but like an acai bowl?

02:57:18.303 --> 02:57:20.804
SAM: Yeah, sure. Yeah, that's a thing.

02:57:20.804 --> 02:57:24.376
MATT: There you go, so it picks up the second day!
There you go.

02:57:24.376 --> 02:57:25.965
LAURA: Is there granola?

02:57:25.965 --> 02:57:27.541
TRAVIS: It doesn't pick up. Don't defend this
shit!

02:57:27.541 --> 02:57:28.930
MATT: Comparatively!

02:57:28.930 --> 02:57:32.686
TRAVIS: Just because it's sweet doesn't mean that
it's savory or satisfying.

02:57:32.686 --> 02:57:34.000
MATT: Fair enough.

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:35.758
JON: There's nothing sticking it together, so it's
just loose.

02:57:35.758 --> 02:57:38.183
TALIESIN: It's only the things that make granola
good that make it not vegan.

02:57:38.183 --> 02:57:39.742
JON: Exactly. It's just all loose.

02:57:39.742 --> 02:57:44.342
TRAVIS: Any proteins that used to have a
heartbeat, in any way? No? Yeah, fuck it.

02:57:44.342 --> 02:57:47.713
LIAM: This is a world of magic and delight!

02:57:47.713 --> 02:57:51.331
LAURA: It's going to catch up when you burp really
good.

02:57:51.331 --> 02:57:53.504
MARISHA: But we have a sound guy who's like--

02:57:53.504 --> 02:57:57.625
LAURA: But what if I want it to catch when I
burp?

02:57:57.625 --> 02:57:59.151
MARISHA: That's what sound guys do.

02:57:59.151 --> 02:58:02.141
MATT: That's how it works? Okay. So what's the
plan, guys?

02:58:02.141 --> 02:58:04.384
LIAM: Stay in the mansion forever.

02:58:04.384 --> 02:58:05.509
MATT: Yeah.

02:58:05.509 --> 02:58:06.765
JON: Let's take a look again.

02:58:06.765 --> 02:58:08.788
ASHLEY: Can I peek out the door?

02:58:08.788 --> 02:58:13.217
TRAVIS: Pike and I go to peek out the door,
because we're not eating shit vegan breakfast.

02:58:13.217 --> 02:58:18.923
MATT: Okay. You peek out into the hallway, and
there before you, you see about 20 or so armored

02:58:18.923 --> 02:58:24.205
skeletons that are all clustered into this
hallway, maybe five feet between a few of them,

02:58:24.205 --> 02:58:26.674
but they're scattered throughout, they're just in
this holding pattern.

02:58:26.674 --> 02:58:28.063
TRAVIS: What do you see?

02:58:28.063 --> 02:58:30.622
ASHLEY: There's just 20 or so skeletons out
there.

02:58:30.622 --> 02:58:33.360
TRAVIS: This is the perfect opportunity!

02:58:33.360 --> 02:58:35.548
ASHLEY: This is the perfect opportunity. Maybe we
take care of it ourselves?

02:58:35.548 --> 02:58:37.469
TRAVIS: I'm saying! You lead the way!

02:58:37.469 --> 02:58:39.686
ASHLEY: Let's do it.

02:58:39.686 --> 02:58:40.783
TRAVIS: Do it.

02:58:40.783 --> 02:58:41.968
SAM: Oh, shit.

02:58:41.968 --> 02:58:43.027
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.

02:58:43.027 --> 02:58:44.616
MARISHA: I approve of this so hard.

02:58:44.616 --> 02:58:45.654
SAM: Wait, we're all still eating breakfast?

02:58:45.654 --> 02:58:47.922
MATT: You guys are eating breakfast, wondering
where Pike and Grog are.

02:58:47.922 --> 02:58:56.859
TRAVIS: Before we break through the door, I should
yell something like, Pike, don't be so brave!

02:58:56.859 --> 02:59:07.091
ASHLEY: Okay, you can yell, Pike, don't be so
brave, and then I can say something like, but

02:59:07.091 --> 02:59:13.951
Grog, you're too strong! I don't know, let me
workshop it.

02:59:13.951 --> 02:59:15.115
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:59:15.115 --> 02:59:17.632
ASHLEY: Grog, you're too strong! You're too
strong, you're

02:59:17.632 --> 02:59:21.366
just going to kill them all anyway.

02:59:21.366 --> 02:59:22.699
TRAVIS: This is true.

02:59:22.699 --> 02:59:25.566
ASHLEY: Should we just wing it?

02:59:25.566 --> 02:59:27.550
TRAVIS: Yeah, just what happens.

02:59:27.550 --> 02:59:29.488
ASHLEY: Okay, ready?

02:59:29.488 --> 02:59:30.790
TRAVIS: On the count of what?

02:59:30.790 --> 02:59:33.171
ASHLEY: On the count of three.

02:59:33.171 --> 02:59:34.525
TRAVIS: I can do that.

02:59:34.525 --> 02:59:35.788
ASHLEY: I know you can!

02:59:35.788 --> 02:59:36.527
TRAVIS: All right.

02:59:36.527 --> 02:59:38.125
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to get my mace ready.

02:59:38.125 --> 02:59:39.400
MATT: Okay.

02:59:39.400 --> 02:59:40.799
TRAVIS: I have my blood axe.

02:59:40.799 --> 02:59:45.294
LIAM: Back at the breakfast table, just before
they make whatever loud sound they're doing: It's

02:59:45.294 --> 02:59:51.384
good, it's almond milk, but I like cream a little
bit (explosion).

02:59:51.384 --> 02:59:56.687
MATT: Yep, suddenly you guys hear-- What do they
hear?

02:59:56.687 --> 02:59:58.230
TRAVIS: One.

02:59:58.230 --> 03:00:01.514
ASHLEY: Two. Three.

03:00:01.514 --> 03:00:02.904
TRAVIS: Oh, that's it, yeah. Three!

03:00:02.904 --> 03:00:06.812
MATT: All right. Scanlan, because this is your
mansion, you feel the door, suddenly, you sense

03:00:06.812 --> 03:00:08.722
the breaching of the front door opening.

03:00:08.722 --> 03:00:13.147
SAM: Oh, God. The door's open.

03:00:13.147 --> 03:00:14.697
ASHLEY: Grog, you're so strong!

03:00:14.697 --> 03:00:17.307
TRAVIS: Oh, Pike, you're so brave!

03:00:17.307 --> 03:00:18.383
LAURA: Oh, shit.

03:00:18.383 --> 03:00:20.354
TRAVIS: You put yourself before others!

03:00:20.354 --> 03:00:22.505
LAURA: I take off running.

03:00:22.505 --> 03:00:23.997
ASHLEY: I'm going to start swinging my mace.

03:00:23.997 --> 03:00:26.650
MATT: You guys all of a sudden drop your meals and
start charging out. The door's already open, and

03:00:26.751 --> 03:00:32.335
it's vacant. You guys, as you charge out, all of a
sudden you watch as ten of these creatures (zombie

03:00:32.335 --> 03:00:35.846
snarling) and leap towards you. What are you
doing, Pike?

03:00:35.846 --> 03:00:40.040
ASHLEY: I start swinging my Mace of Disruption.
Can I just do this as I go through?

03:00:40.040 --> 03:00:44.089
MATT: You'll still do attacks, but they'll get
attacks on you as you go back and forth.

03:00:44.089 --> 03:00:45.127
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:00:45.127 --> 03:00:51.698
MATT: You rush forward. Go ahead and make your
attack. Is it, as a war-- do you have two attacks?

03:00:51.698 --> 03:00:54.009
As a bonus action, you can attack, right?

03:00:54.009 --> 03:00:56.974
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! I
forgot, I haven't done this in a minute with

03:00:56.974 --> 03:00:59.386
undead! Okay.

03:00:59.386 --> 03:01:01.442
LAURA: What does the Mace of Disruption do to
undead?

03:01:01.442 --> 03:01:02.709
LIAM: Area of effect, y'all.

03:01:02.709 --> 03:01:06.492
MATT: No, no, it just hits targets. It's the other
one does.

03:01:06.492 --> 03:01:09.526
ASHLEY: It says when you hit a fiend or undead
with this magic weapon, the creature takes an

03:01:09.526 --> 03:01:11.227
extra 2d6 radiant damage.

03:01:11.227 --> 03:01:12.300
MATT: Yep.

03:01:12.300 --> 03:01:24.123
ASHLEY: So. Oh, okay. So 17 and 22.

03:01:24.123 --> 03:01:28.411
MATT: 17 and 22 both hit. Go ahead and roll damage
for each, with the additional disruption damage.

03:01:28.411 --> 03:01:37.953
ASHLEY: Okay, so, I don't have all of the dice
out.

03:01:37.953 --> 03:01:41.205
LAURA: See, this is why you take the time at the
beginning to organize.

03:01:41.205 --> 03:01:43.498
MATT: I know. Grog, while this is happening,
you're also charging in with her

03:01:43.498 --> 03:01:44.591
and you're attacking?

03:01:44.591 --> 03:01:46.608
TRAVIS: Yeah, Great Weapon Master with the blood
axe.

03:01:46.608 --> 03:01:48.846
MATT: Go ahead and make your two attacks with it.

03:01:48.846 --> 03:02:00.533
ASHLEY: So with undead I also roll an additional
2d6, so am I doing four? How many?

03:02:00.533 --> 03:02:05.450
MATT: You would do additional damage as part of
your cleric's war--

03:02:05.450 --> 03:02:07.779
ASHLEY: Okay, so 1d6, plus 2d8.

03:02:07.779 --> 03:02:11.269
MATT: Is the additional disruption damage?

03:02:11.269 --> 03:02:17.430
ASHLEY: Is just one strike. Sorry, I haven't done
this in a while.

03:02:17.430 --> 03:02:28.396
MATT: All right, so as a war domain cleric, you
can make a weapon attack as a bonus action, up to

03:02:28.396 --> 03:02:34.337
your wisdom modifier per day, so that's one use
there. And you deal an additional 1d8 weapon

03:02:34.337 --> 03:02:37.643
damage on the attack, so it's-- How much damage
does your mace do?

03:02:37.643 --> 03:02:44.225
ASHLEY: 1d6 plus six and 2d8 is what I have
written down.

03:02:44.225 --> 03:02:45.426
LAURA: For Divine Strike.

03:02:45.426 --> 03:02:46.433
ASHLEY: For Divine Strike.

03:02:46.433 --> 03:02:51.310
MATT: Correct, yes. Yeah, because you reached 14th
level. So yeah, it's plus 2d8. You got it. 1d6

03:02:51.310 --> 03:02:53.570
plus 2d8 plus whatever the disruption damage is.

03:02:53.570 --> 03:03:00.071
ASHLEY: Okay, so 18.

03:03:00.071 --> 03:03:04.917
MATT: 18 damage on the first hit? You slam the
mace into the side of a skeleton, and it crushes a

03:03:04.917 --> 03:03:09.299
lot of the bone, and a lot of it just seems to
erode away as the divine flash impacts it, and you

03:03:09.299 --> 03:03:15.700
watch as the bleached white turns to gray and
black. However, it still stands, largely wrecked,

03:03:15.700 --> 03:03:19.540
but still (zombie snarling). And your second
attack, you hit the same one?

03:03:19.540 --> 03:03:20.501
ASHLEY: Yep.

03:03:20.501 --> 03:03:23.033
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage for that
one.

03:03:23.033 --> 03:03:25.030
ASHLEY: Okay. 14.

03:03:25.030 --> 03:03:28.989
MATT: All right, that one (whack) you hit the side
of the skull, and the head just turns into dust to

03:03:28.989 --> 03:03:32.566
the side. The bones collapse into a pile. You
destroyed one skeleton out of about 20 or so.

03:03:32.566 --> 03:03:34.034
Grog, what are you doing?

03:03:34.034 --> 03:03:37.277
TRAVIS: I did my first attack, it was a 26, and so
was the second one,

03:03:37.277 --> 03:03:38.561
both with Great Weapon Master.

03:03:38.561 --> 03:03:40.156
MATT: Both hit with Great Weapon Master. Go ahead
and roll damage.

03:03:40.156 --> 03:03:41.669
TRAVIS: The first one was 26 damage.

03:03:41.669 --> 03:03:45.582
MATT: You completely destroy a skeleton in one
hit. It turns into a scattering of bone (shatter)

03:03:45.582 --> 03:03:46.844
across the wall.

03:03:46.844 --> 03:03:47.909
TRAVIS: That's what up.

03:03:47.909 --> 03:03:50.044
ASHLEY: Grog, it's so crazy how strong you are!
They're all dying!

03:03:50.044 --> 03:03:52.202
TRAVIS: I know, but I only do it to protect my
friends!

03:03:52.202 --> 03:03:55.923
And the second one is 39 points of damage.

03:03:55.923 --> 03:04:00.358
MATT: And with that second hit, a second skeleton
that's leaping towards you, with a giant scimitar

03:04:00.358 --> 03:04:04.999
in the air and a buckler around the side of its
wrist, (zombie snarling), you just batter-up swing

03:04:04.999 --> 03:04:10.049
it, and it explodes across and rains down upon
you. Pike, a couple of the bones hit your armor,

03:04:10.049 --> 03:04:11.626
fall to the side.

03:04:11.626 --> 03:04:15.786
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, can I go into a rage
and go, I kill these skeletons because I would

03:04:15.786 --> 03:04:17.786
never replace a friend like you!

03:04:17.786 --> 03:04:20.512
ASHLEY: I know, Grog!

03:04:20.512 --> 03:04:24.593
MATT: All right, and so as you guys are rushing
into the doorway, the skeletons immediately turn

03:04:24.593 --> 03:04:29.372
and swarm in. That's going to be five attacks on
each of you within this range here.

03:04:29.372 --> 03:04:30.704
So, against Pike.

03:04:30.704 --> 03:04:33.247
LAURA: Quick, use your spells!

03:04:33.247 --> 03:04:40.638
MATT: All right, so it misses Pike. Misses Pike.
God, misses Pike. Misses Pike.

03:04:40.638 --> 03:04:43.722
And a 20. What's your AC?

03:04:43.722 --> 03:04:46.490
ASHLEY: My AC is 23.

03:04:46.490 --> 03:04:51.512
MATT: 23. All of them leap onto you, but they
can't get through the armor. They're all clustered

03:04:51.512 --> 03:04:55.855
up around you, they're piled up almost, like
you're just being dogpiled by skeletons, and while

03:04:55.855 --> 03:05:00.489
none of them are getting to your flesh, there are
all these skulls biting in front of your face as

03:05:00.489 --> 03:05:06.693
you're holding them back with your shield and
mace. Grog. Miss. Natural one, miss.

03:05:06.693 --> 03:05:09.741
Two, miss. 20?

03:05:09.741 --> 03:05:10.866
TRAVIS: That hits.

03:05:10.866 --> 03:05:13.113
MATT: And 21?

03:05:13.113 --> 03:05:14.280
TRAVIS: Also hits.

03:05:14.280 --> 03:05:20.489
MATT: All right. So, you take 22 points of
slashing damage, reduced to 11, from the two

03:05:20.489 --> 03:05:24.368
attacks together. As both of these skeletons just
start hacking into you with their weapons. One has

03:05:24.368 --> 03:05:28.927
a long sword, one has what looks to be some sort
of a war pick and is just, both of them, jamming

03:05:28.927 --> 03:05:33.411
into your flesh, and you just take it without an
issue. All right. You guys all rush to the door

03:05:33.411 --> 03:05:38.758
and you look out and you can see this group of
undead there, swarming your two friends. You get

03:05:38.758 --> 03:05:41.481
there just-- Well, you start preparing for the
round. They're going first.

03:05:41.481 --> 03:05:42.762
Pike, what are you doing?

03:05:42.762 --> 03:05:46.817
ASHLEY: I'm going to Guiding Bolt down the
hallway. Towards the rest of the skeletons.

03:05:46.817 --> 03:05:48.911
MATT: Guiding Bolt can only hit one target.

03:05:48.911 --> 03:05:50.201
ASHLEY: Oh shit!

03:05:50.201 --> 03:05:56.497
MATT: Yeah, the area effects that you have are
your Turn Undead or Destroy Undead, or any of the

03:05:56.497 --> 03:05:57.717
spells that you have.

03:05:57.717 --> 03:05:58.670
LAURA: Destroy Undead!

03:05:58.670 --> 03:06:00.850
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, Destroy Undead. Fuck, I forgot
about-- Sorry, it's been a minute since I've been

03:06:00.850 --> 03:06:03.262
around them. Okay, yeah, Destroy Undead.

03:06:03.262 --> 03:06:04.484
LIAM: Come on, cleric.

03:06:04.484 --> 03:06:08.135
MATT: Okay. So you are--

03:06:08.135 --> 03:06:09.241
ASHLEY: It's been a minute.

03:06:09.241 --> 03:06:13.866
MATT: Yeah. You're a 17th level cleric now? 16th
level? What level are you?

03:06:13.866 --> 03:06:15.532
ASHLEY: I think 16th level. I don't know if I've
leveled.

03:06:15.532 --> 03:06:26.687
MATT: Yeah, 16th level. So, CR 3 or lower. These
are definitely there. All right. All righty. So,

03:06:26.687 --> 03:06:32.732
you're going to affect with that, in a radial area
here, which is a radius of 30 feet. That's going

03:06:32.732 --> 03:06:34.923
to affect 15 of these undead.

03:06:34.923 --> 03:06:35.988
LAURA: Nice!

03:06:35.988 --> 03:06:37.806
MATT: Within the ones that are piled on you, that
piled on Grog, and the ones that are swarming

03:06:37.806 --> 03:06:39.732
behind. What's your spell DC?

03:06:39.732 --> 03:06:44.154
ASHLEY: 18.

03:06:44.154 --> 03:06:48.347
MATT: Okay. Rolled an 18, but it's a minus one.

03:06:48.347 --> 03:06:55.722
LAURA: Yay. Do you roll for all 15?

03:06:55.722 --> 03:06:56.774
MATT: Mm-hm.

03:06:56.774 --> 03:07:00.506
LIAM: Here he goes. Math. Still math.

03:07:00.506 --> 03:07:02.195
MATT: Oh, no, that one survived.

03:07:02.195 --> 03:07:04.664
LIAM: More math.

03:07:04.664 --> 03:07:11.120
LAURA: Don't confuse him. It's a lot to keep track
of. Hey guys, we have these amazing art prints by

03:07:11.120 --> 03:07:12.275
David Mack.

03:07:12.275 --> 03:07:14.024
MATT: Almost done.

03:07:14.024 --> 03:07:16.396
ASHLEY: Oh fuck, are they all making it?

03:07:16.396 --> 03:07:24.291
MATT: All right. So, out of the 15, two survive.
As you're held down by all of these skeletons,

03:07:24.291 --> 03:07:29.337
suddenly this beacon of divine, bright flame
begins to burst from you. And you watch as the

03:07:29.337 --> 03:07:36.306
flaming wings of Sarenrae swirl up out of her like
a phoenix. And as it does, you see above her the

03:07:36.306 --> 03:07:43.806
image of the dark skin, light flaming hair
Sarenrae embodying her like a JoJo stand, as it

03:07:43.806 --> 03:07:50.073
takes this pose. And as soon as Pike brings her
arms out and screams (yells), the image bursts out

03:07:50.073 --> 03:07:54.264
and you watch as every skeleton practically in
that radius just turns to ash and dust in the

03:07:54.264 --> 03:08:02.582
vicinity, leaving two skeletons there, that are
like (breathy groan). So there's maybe four of

03:08:02.582 --> 03:08:05.283
them left in the whole tunnel, from that one
burst.

03:08:05.283 --> 03:08:07.052
TRAVIS: Damn!

03:08:07.052 --> 03:08:08.557
LAURA: I nudge Scanlan.

03:08:08.557 --> 03:08:10.166
TRAVIS: That was amazing.

03:08:10.166 --> 03:08:11.244
ASHLEY: Do you think Scanlan saw?

03:08:11.244 --> 03:08:12.934
TRAVIS: Yeah, how could he miss it?

03:08:12.934 --> 03:08:14.086
SAM: I'm at the door.

03:08:14.086 --> 03:08:17.835
TRAVIS: (voice breaking) You and me against the
world, huh?

03:08:17.835 --> 03:08:22.218
ASHLEY: You and me, Grog. We're so loyal to each
other.

03:08:22.218 --> 03:08:24.709
TRAVIS: Yep, to the end. Best friends.

03:08:24.709 --> 03:08:26.276
ASHLEY: Best friends till the end.

03:08:26.276 --> 03:08:28.041
MATT: Grog, what are you doing?

03:08:28.041 --> 03:08:29.398
TRAVIS: I'm hitting things.

03:08:29.398 --> 03:08:31.242
MATT: All right, so you rush up to the two.

03:08:31.242 --> 03:08:34.786
LIAM: I walk back to the kitchen and start
clearing people's plates.

03:08:34.786 --> 03:08:35.755
MATT: Okay.

03:08:35.755 --> 03:08:37.228
(laughter)

03:08:37.228 --> 03:08:39.359
SAM: I'll step out into the fray just to watch.

03:08:39.359 --> 03:08:41.057
TRAVIS: A regular strike, 25.

03:08:41.057 --> 03:08:42.149
MATT: Hits.

03:08:42.149 --> 03:08:43.744
TRAVIS: Ooh, and a 17.

03:08:43.744 --> 03:08:45.353
MATT: Yeah, they all hit.

03:08:45.353 --> 03:08:47.531
TRAVIS: That's as low as I can roll.

03:08:47.531 --> 03:08:49.169
MATT: 17 is a low for you.

03:08:49.169 --> 03:08:53.510
TRAVIS: I know. 16 points of damage on the first
one.

03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:57.941
MATT: All right, first hit, it smacks into the
side and breaks part of its upper shoulder and

03:08:57.941 --> 03:09:02.376
upper arm. It cuts off one of its arms, but it's
still standing there in front of you.

03:09:02.376 --> 03:09:06.812
TRAVIS: That's embarrassing. I use the second
strike on the same skeleton

03:09:06.812 --> 03:09:08.757
and hope Scanlan didn't notice.

03:09:08.757 --> 03:09:09.859
SAM: I saw.

03:09:09.859 --> 03:09:11.739
(laughter)

03:09:11.739 --> 03:09:13.924
TRAVIS: Fuck. 15 points of damage.

03:09:13.924 --> 03:09:16.982
MATT: 15 points of damage does destroy the
skeleton, the one that's giving you a hard time.

03:09:16.982 --> 03:09:21.426
This time you just cleave through the center of
its spinal column and torso. It tumbles over and

03:09:21.426 --> 03:09:22.973
just scatters into a pile of bones.

03:09:22.973 --> 03:09:29.429
TRAVIS: Yeah. He saw it, didn't he? I fucked it
up. He saw it and my whole plan's gone to shit.

03:09:29.429 --> 03:09:31.773
ASHLEY: So much is happening at once, he can't
see, he didn't see.

03:09:31.773 --> 03:09:37.298
MATT: All right, so. Vex, you're at the door.
Scanlan, you're at the door. You're at the door,

03:09:37.298 --> 03:09:38.954
Lionel. What are you guys doing?

03:09:38.954 --> 03:09:41.490
LAURA: I sh-- I'm going to hold it.

03:09:41.490 --> 03:09:42.987
MATT: There's three skeletons still standing.

03:09:42.987 --> 03:09:46.330
LAURA: All right, I'll shoot one of the
skeletons.

03:09:46.330 --> 03:09:49.108
MATT: Go for it. Roll for attack. Lionel, what are
you doing?

03:09:49.108 --> 03:09:54.391
JON: I'm just like: it's cool. I'm just watching.
I forget, you know--

03:09:54.391 --> 03:09:55.487
MATT: Okay.

03:09:55.487 --> 03:10:07.925
JON: But then I see and I'm like: Oh, I got them.
So I think it's now time to impress Grog a little

03:10:07.925 --> 03:10:11.012
bit, because he knows-- He goes into a rage.

03:10:11.012 --> 03:10:13.653
MATT: All right, so you go into a rage. Pull your
great sword?

03:10:13.653 --> 03:10:15.931
JON: My what?

03:10:15.931 --> 03:10:17.832
(laughter)

03:10:17.832 --> 03:10:19.779
MATT: All right, so you're charging out. What did
you roll?

03:10:19.779 --> 03:10:22.815
LAURA: Oh, I just decided maybe I shouldn't hit
them, though.

03:10:22.815 --> 03:10:25.857
MATT: All right, so you go to fire and then pull
the arrow back.

03:10:25.857 --> 03:10:27.229
LAURA: Because I rolled a one.

03:10:27.229 --> 03:10:28.434
(laughter)

03:10:28.434 --> 03:10:29.422
MATT: Oh.

03:10:29.422 --> 03:10:30.600
JON: Wait a second.

03:10:30.600 --> 03:10:33.989
LAURA: Oh no, it's the chicken-Scanlan incident
all over again.

03:10:33.989 --> 03:10:36.473
MATT: So what happens is, you go and release it,
and you just mis-strung it (sound of rope

03:10:36.473 --> 03:10:38.341
snapping), and you're like: Oh, I just didn't--

03:10:38.341 --> 03:10:40.266
LAURA: You know what? I'm going to leave it. It's
for them.

03:10:40.266 --> 03:10:41.482
TRAVIS: She's got the bruise on the--

03:10:41.482 --> 03:10:45.431
MATT: Yeah. So you rush up alongside Grog at the
three skeletons that are there.

03:10:45.431 --> 03:10:48.000
LAURA: I got a blood blister on my arm.

03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:50.854
JON: I roll this?

03:10:50.854 --> 03:10:54.113
TALIESIN: Yeah, and you add the attack bonus of
your great sword, which is right in the center.

03:10:54.113 --> 03:10:55.510
JON: Plus 12.

03:10:55.575 --> 03:10:57.840
TALIESIN: Oh, natural 20!

03:10:57.840 --> 03:10:59.951
MATT: Oh, critical hit on the first hit?

03:10:59.951 --> 03:11:01.778
TRAVIS: Motherfucker.

03:11:01.778 --> 03:11:03.659
MATT: All right, so that hits. Roll the second
attack.

03:11:03.659 --> 03:11:05.085
SAM: He's so strong.

03:11:05.085 --> 03:11:06.359
LAURA: Don't say that!

03:11:06.359 --> 03:11:08.034
TALIESIN: Another?! What?! What?!

03:11:08.034 --> 03:11:09.210
JON: Another 20.

03:11:09.210 --> 03:11:10.558
MATT: Did you roll two 20s in a row?

03:11:10.558 --> 03:11:11.982
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

03:11:11.982 --> 03:11:15.656
JON: He's raging, dude, and he's had a really
great sleep in the sand.

03:11:15.656 --> 03:11:17.341
SAM: I've never seen anyone so strong and powerful
before.

03:11:17.341 --> 03:11:19.363
TALIESIN: He doesn't even understand what just
happened.

03:11:19.363 --> 03:11:20.605
JON: Are you getting turned on?

03:11:20.605 --> 03:11:21.553
SAM: Yes!

03:11:21.553 --> 03:11:24.260
MATT: You're honing Vin Diesel right now with this
crit power.

03:11:24.260 --> 03:11:29.427
JON: Well, he's finally-- He likes these guys, he
wants to finally show off and do something cool.

03:11:29.427 --> 03:11:31.314
TALIESIN: Travis just aged a year.

03:11:31.314 --> 03:11:33.299
LAURA: Oh no.

03:11:33.299 --> 03:11:38.894
MATT: So you rush forward to the first skeleton.
Roll 2d6.

03:11:38.894 --> 03:11:40.525
TALIESIN: Roll 4d6.

03:11:40.525 --> 03:11:41.945
MATT: Yeah, roll 4d6.

03:11:41.945 --> 03:11:43.530
TALIESIN: Roll four of these.

03:11:43.530 --> 03:11:44.897
JON: Which ones? Okay.

03:11:44.897 --> 03:11:46.374
TALIESIN: And I think you get to reroll.

03:11:46.374 --> 03:11:47.812
JON: I have to roll the two dice.

03:11:47.812 --> 03:11:50.147
TALIESIN: Yeah, roll those and add two more. Or
roll them twice.

03:11:50.147 --> 03:11:52.068
Yeah, there you go. Four of those.

03:11:52.068 --> 03:11:54.106
MATT: And then you get to reroll any ones or twos.

03:11:54.106 --> 03:11:56.854
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

03:11:56.854 --> 03:11:59.035
TRAVIS: What? Are they all fucking sixes?

03:11:59.035 --> 03:12:00.062
JON: Is that a six?

03:12:00.062 --> 03:12:00.937
TALIESIN: That's a six.

03:12:00.937 --> 03:12:02.188
JON: Six, six, three, three.

03:12:02.188 --> 03:12:04.014
MATT: Okay, so 12, 18 plus?

03:12:04.014 --> 03:12:05.793
TRAVIS: Percy, take your hand off of him.

03:12:05.793 --> 03:12:08.624
JON: No, he needs the help.

03:12:08.624 --> 03:12:13.529
MATT: So as you rush forward with your greatsword,
big smile on your face, next to Grog. Whack! You

03:12:13.529 --> 03:12:16.948
just shatter one skeleton with the first attack.
Roll damage for the second attack.

03:12:16.948 --> 03:12:18.006
TALIESIN: All four.

03:12:18.006 --> 03:12:19.598
MATT: All four again.

03:12:19.598 --> 03:12:25.480
SAM: Six. That one's cocked, reroll it. Six.

03:12:25.480 --> 03:12:27.596
(laughter)

03:12:27.596 --> 03:12:29.525
TRAVIS: I'm leaving. I'm going away.

03:12:29.525 --> 03:12:35.718
JON: And I'm like: Grog, look at this, this is
awesome! I think I'm channeling you.

03:12:35.718 --> 03:12:38.568
TRAVIS: (strained voice) Yep. Real impressive.

03:12:38.568 --> 03:12:42.939
MATT: You just, one skeleton, the other comes
jumping at you and you just grab it in your hand

03:12:42.939 --> 03:12:45.479
and crush its skull in your hand.

03:12:45.479 --> 03:12:46.993
TRAVIS: (strained voice) That was real cool.

03:12:46.993 --> 03:12:48.882
JON: And then I go: Look, I'm a gymnast!

03:12:48.882 --> 03:12:51.693
(laughter)

03:12:51.693 --> 03:12:53.501
JON: With all the chalk and everything.

03:12:53.501 --> 03:12:54.946
LIAM: You've got to appreciate that, Travis.

03:12:54.946 --> 03:12:59.733
TRAVIS: (strained voice) It was a good moment.
That was really impressive.

03:12:59.733 --> 03:13:02.409
MATT: Percy. You want to do anything?

03:13:02.409 --> 03:13:07.315
TALIESIN: I'm just going to sit next to Vex and I
think we're just

03:13:07.315 --> 03:13:08.856
going to stand and let this happen.

03:13:08.856 --> 03:13:12.947
MATT: So Pike, Grog, Lionel, you're right there,
there's one skeleton left that's like (breathy

03:13:12.947 --> 03:13:24.148
hiss). And it leaps at you, since you just crushed
its friend. And it hits you on your breastplate

03:13:24.148 --> 03:13:30.020
and just goes (metal ringing out sound) (breathy
hiss). That's all it does. It's a sad sight.

03:13:30.020 --> 03:13:35.485
JON: Look, it's doing the Duck Flail to me. It's
not as good, but that is what he's doing.

03:13:35.485 --> 03:13:38.667
MATT: All right, who wants to finish this poor
thing?

03:13:38.667 --> 03:13:40.879
ASHLEY: Finish him, Grog, finish it.

03:13:40.879 --> 03:13:42.912
TRAVIS: I'm broken on the inside. Did you see that
display?

03:13:42.912 --> 03:13:44.638
ASHLEY: Grog, I need your help!

03:13:44.638 --> 03:13:48.786
TRAVIS: (yells) Reckless, Great Weapon Master.

03:13:48.786 --> 03:13:50.622
(laughter)

03:13:50.622 --> 03:13:52.482
MATT: Go for it, Grog.

03:13:52.482 --> 03:13:55.103
TRAVIS: A one?!

03:13:55.103 --> 03:13:56.232
TALIESIN: Yes!

03:13:56.232 --> 03:13:57.496
TRAVIS: A one?!!

03:13:57.496 --> 03:14:01.782
(laughter and yelling)

03:14:01.782 --> 03:14:03.782
ASHLEY: Can I War God's Bless it?

03:14:03.782 --> 03:14:08.443
MATT: A natural one is an auto fail. I cannot-- I
cannot--

03:14:08.443 --> 03:14:10.482
TRAVIS: What is going on?!

03:14:10.482 --> 03:14:12.894
(laughter)

03:14:12.894 --> 03:14:20.899
MATT: As you look at the one skeleton, just
feeling this embarrassment, you swing with your

03:14:20.899 --> 03:14:26.971
axe and the skeleton (metal impact sound) stops it
with its own blade and parries the axe to the

03:14:26.971 --> 03:14:32.314
side. The one that just didn't barely dent his
armor.

03:14:32.314 --> 03:14:37.253
JON: And then I say: It's okay, Grog. Everybody
messes up sometimes, let me get this one.

03:14:37.253 --> 03:14:40.062
(laughter)

03:14:40.062 --> 03:14:43.753
JON: Can I roll?

03:14:43.753 --> 03:14:45.910
MATT: Yeah.

03:14:45.910 --> 03:14:47.717
TALIESIN: That's a nine.

03:14:47.717 --> 03:14:49.724
SAM: As he rolls, I will inspire him.

03:14:49.724 --> 03:14:55.003
JON: Nine plus 12, that's 21. 22!

03:14:55.003 --> 03:14:57.012
SAM: I'm going to sing-- Oh well, that's fine,
that's fine.

03:14:57.012 --> 03:15:02.938
MATT: So that hits. Go ahead and roll damage. Just
2d6 plus seven. Well, plus your--

03:15:02.938 --> 03:15:04.240
TALIESIN: Just two.

03:15:04.240 --> 03:15:05.774
JON: Oh, okay.

03:15:05.774 --> 03:15:07.773
SAM: Okay, that's not as good.

03:15:07.773 --> 03:15:09.901
MATT: Well, it's plus seven, plus your rage
damage. So it's plus ten.

03:15:09.901 --> 03:15:13.404
SAM: To this? 15.

03:15:13.404 --> 03:15:14.950
TALIESIN: No, plus seven also.

03:15:14.950 --> 03:15:16.895
MATT: Plus ten to whatever he rolled there.

03:15:16.895 --> 03:15:18.236
SAM: Five plus ten.

03:15:18.236 --> 03:15:23.352
MATT: All right, so 20 points. So as you hack down
this other skeleton, you cut into it and it

03:15:23.352 --> 03:15:28.114
destroys part of its torso. Its arm that's holding
its weapon is hanging to the side, but it's still

03:15:28.114 --> 03:15:29.949
standing. Its jaw is unhinged.

03:15:29.949 --> 03:15:31.788
TALIESIN: You get another shot, don't you?

03:15:31.788 --> 03:15:33.001
MATT: Yep. So you attack again.

03:15:33.001 --> 03:15:34.904
TALIESIN: Yeah, attack again.

03:15:34.904 --> 03:15:36.371
JON: Four?

03:15:36.371 --> 03:15:37.605
TALIESIN: 16?

03:15:37.605 --> 03:15:43.235
MATT: 16 still hits. It's a skeleton. That's
enough. You finish it off. You destroy the other

03:15:43.235 --> 03:15:44.629
skeleton in two hits.

03:15:44.629 --> 03:15:53.424
JON: That was kind of a tough one, I get it. It's
okay. That was a really hard skeleton. But he's

03:15:53.424 --> 03:15:55.056
dead now. Let's go--

03:15:55.056 --> 03:15:58.772
ASHLEY: We had it. We just-- We had it.

03:15:58.772 --> 03:16:03.337
JON: Can we eat these skeletons, because that
breakfast is still blowing.

03:16:03.337 --> 03:16:05.425
ASHLEY: Yes you can. Give it a bite. Give it a
bite.

03:16:05.425 --> 03:16:07.521
JON: Is there any meat left on those bones?

03:16:07.521 --> 03:16:12.476
SAM: Chod, that was amazing. You slew those
skeletons like they were nothing. Incredible.

03:16:12.476 --> 03:16:17.718
JON: Oh, I just do whatever I can for my friends.
You guys are all awesome and I'm just glad I could

03:16:17.718 --> 03:16:19.404
be of service and help.

03:16:19.404 --> 03:16:22.486
SAM: Yes. It's good to have someone like you by
our side.

03:16:22.486 --> 03:16:23.630
JON: Awesome!

03:16:23.630 --> 03:16:25.587
ASHLEY: I walk back inside of the mansion.

03:16:25.587 --> 03:16:29.064
TRAVIS: I take out the giant cask of ale and I
just...

03:16:29.064 --> 03:16:32.182
MATT: Just chug it.

03:16:32.182 --> 03:16:35.136
SAM: Are you drinking it or just pouring it all
over you?

03:16:35.136 --> 03:16:36.363
TRAVIS: Both.

03:16:36.363 --> 03:16:39.291
LIAM: I come out with fresh coffee for Percy and
Keyleth. What happened?

03:16:39.291 --> 03:16:42.949
TALIESIN: It was beautiful, terrible. I'm not
entirely sure.

03:16:42.949 --> 03:16:46.444
ASHLEY: Chod saved the day. Chod saved the day.

03:16:46.444 --> 03:16:50.534
TALIESIN: Well, really, he cleaned up after you
two finished it all off.

03:16:50.534 --> 03:16:51.932
ASHLEY: He did. He did.

03:16:51.932 --> 03:16:52.902
TALIESIN: He swept up.

03:16:52.902 --> 03:16:56.168
LAURA: That was a lot of skeletons that you
killed, Pike, with that spell.

03:16:56.168 --> 03:16:57.419
That was really good.

03:16:57.419 --> 03:16:59.831
TALIESIN: You and Grog were most of the skeletons,
easily.

03:16:59.831 --> 03:17:01.068
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:17:01.068 --> 03:17:02.461
SAM: Are we all back in the mansion?

03:17:02.461 --> 03:17:03.890
MATT: You're all back in the mansion, now.

03:17:03.890 --> 03:17:05.852
LIAM: Why is it so tense in here all of a sudden?

03:17:05.852 --> 03:17:07.784
SAM: I think I know what's going on.

03:17:07.784 --> 03:17:09.213
ASHLEY: I don't know what happened.

03:17:09.213 --> 03:17:16.107
SAM: Grog. Grog, Pike, can I say something? I feel
like there's some tension between us and we need

03:17:16.107 --> 03:17:26.882
to clear the air if we're going to go fight today.
You guys are really bad today. Well. And I think

03:17:26.882 --> 03:17:36.242
it's because I haven't made you feel at ease. So
can I please just take a moment before we go out

03:17:36.242 --> 03:17:42.992
there and just, for once and for all, say I'm
sorry to you guys for what I did and how I left

03:17:42.992 --> 03:17:50.171
things. I said things that were really cruel and
meant to hurt you, and that's wrong and I'll

03:17:50.171 --> 03:17:55.903
probably regret it for the rest of my life. But I
needed to go and I just didn't know how to express

03:17:55.903 --> 03:18:03.934
myself. And I'm so sorry that I insulted you.
Pike, I've said awful things to you for as long as

03:18:03.934 --> 03:18:08.474
we've known each other, and I can't take them
back, but I can at least try to be a better

03:18:08.474 --> 03:18:24.366
person. And can I confess something to you? During
the last year, I've-- I think I've been praying. I

03:18:24.366 --> 03:18:31.694
mean, I just talk at night and nobody hears me,
but I guess that's praying, right? And sometimes I

03:18:31.694 --> 03:18:41.045
talk to Sarenrae, because that's the only one I
know. And she seems cool. And she seems like

03:18:41.045 --> 03:18:50.076
someone who could be a good guide. And it feels
good. And I even wrote a little poem about her and

03:18:50.076 --> 03:18:55.663
about her teachings. It's very simple, but can I
tell you it?

03:18:55.663 --> 03:19:00.594
ASHLEY: Let's hear.

03:19:00.594 --> 03:19:12.154
SAM: It's really simple. It goes: "Everybody
people, everybody bleed, everybody need something.

03:19:12.154 --> 03:19:22.204
"Everybody love, everybody know, how it go." I know
it's stupid, but there's a certain Logic to it.

03:19:22.204 --> 03:19:27.474
ASHLEY: Certain Logic to it. That actually makes a
lot of sense.

03:19:27.474 --> 03:19:36.779
SAM: It makes me feel connected to you guys, even
though you're not there. So I say that to myself

03:19:36.779 --> 03:19:39.009
every night before I go to sleep.

03:19:39.009 --> 03:19:42.321
ASHLEY: It just makes you feel connected to
Everybody people.

03:19:42.321 --> 03:19:44.096
SAM: Yeah.

03:19:44.096 --> 03:19:45.412
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:19:45.412 --> 03:19:46.446
SAM: And Grog.

03:19:46.446 --> 03:19:47.645
TRAVIS: No, stop.

03:19:47.645 --> 03:19:50.866
SAM: I can't apologize to you, because words don't
work.

03:19:50.866 --> 03:19:59.254
TRAVIS: So, let me get this straight. You think
you can go away for a year, and come back, &lt;i&gt;in a&lt;/i&gt;

03:19:59.254 --> 03:20:07.114
&lt;i&gt;disguise,&lt;/i&gt; and apologize to this group, and that's
going to be good enough for me? And then when I'm

03:20:07.114 --> 03:20:12.478
still pissed, you're going to give me a combo
apology with Pike, and that's going to be good

03:20:12.478 --> 03:20:20.959
enough for me? I'm still pissed. You came back in
a costume. A costume! I'm not even really that

03:20:20.959 --> 03:20:28.094
smart, it's not hard to trick me. And I'm a big
guy, but you made me feel &lt;i&gt;small.&lt;/i&gt; I don't know if

03:20:28.094 --> 03:20:35.652
you missed us; I don't know if somebody is making
us go down into this Zigga-fuck.

03:20:35.652 --> 03:20:37.055
ASHLEY: (whispers) Ziggurat.

03:20:37.055 --> 03:20:42.796
TRAVIS: Ziggurat. I don't even know why we're
here. I thought maybe you'd come back and be like,

03:20:42.796 --> 03:20:52.067
oh my best mate, the guy that would do anything to
keep me alive, there he is, I missed him. No. You

03:20:52.067 --> 03:20:59.217
come back, you've found yourself a brand new
idiot. One that does amazing strikes, twice in a

03:20:59.217 --> 03:21:06.728
row. And talks to ducks. Has all sorts of new
tricks, brand new model, new and improved in every

03:21:06.728 --> 03:21:17.593
way. I bet you do all sorts of fun things with
him. So no. You do not get to apologize to me.

03:21:17.593 --> 03:21:28.831
SAM: I wasn't going to. I was just going to give
you a gift. Because the times we had together were

03:21:28.831 --> 03:21:40.237
the best times ever. You might be a little slow.
But you're the best friend I ever had. And our

03:21:40.237 --> 03:21:50.007
times together were great, not because of our
conversations, or our witty repartee. It was

03:21:50.007 --> 03:21:56.953
because of the fun we had together and the
experiences we had. So last night, I wrote

03:21:56.953 --> 03:22:00.534
something for you. I know you can't read, but--

03:22:00.534 --> 03:22:01.777
LAURA: He &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; read.

03:22:01.777 --> 03:22:04.862
TRAVIS: No, Vex. He doesn't know that.

03:22:04.862 --> 03:22:15.553
SAM: I just got you a gift. Because if you won't
spend time with me now, maybe you'll be able to

03:22:15.553 --> 03:22:23.547
spend time on your own. So I wrote you this. Maybe
someone else can read it for him.

03:22:23.547 --> 03:22:26.482
ASHLEY: He might be able to read it, Scanlan.

03:22:26.482 --> 03:22:28.859
LAURA: It depends on if there are long words.

03:22:28.859 --> 03:22:30.364
SAM: There's really long words.

03:22:30.364 --> 03:22:32.027
TRAVIS: It's a big word. It's a bit--

03:22:32.027 --> 03:22:34.567
ASHLEY: Well, just give it a try.

03:22:34.567 --> 03:22:38.715
TRAVIS: Aoo, ooh, shh.

03:22:38.715 --> 03:22:40.112
SAM: Nope. Nope.

03:22:40.112 --> 03:22:45.781
TRAVIS: (whispering) I'm really embarrassed. I'm
really embarrassed.

03:22:45.781 --> 03:22:47.853
ASHLEY: (whispering) I'll whisper it to you, then
you say it out loud.

03:22:47.853 --> 03:22:54.907
TRAVIS: (clears throat) Yeah, I don't feel like
showing off my powers. I can't read the dirty hand

03:22:54.907 --> 03:22:56.925
of betrayal.

03:22:56.925 --> 03:23:05.938
ASHLEY: All who read this, let it be known, by
order of Aes Adon-- it's a stupid name, Scanlan.

03:23:05.938 --> 03:23:08.138
But it's fine.

03:23:08.138 --> 03:23:09.548
SAM: It's Elvish.

03:23:09.548 --> 03:23:11.943
LIAM: It's a stupid name.

03:23:11.943 --> 03:23:26.002
ASHLEY: AKA the Meat Man, AKA Vicoul the Vicious,
AKA Reddish the Bold, AKA the Little Paws, AKA

03:23:26.002 --> 03:23:35.872
François Bertrand Jean-Luc Australia, be aware
that the bearer of this note, Grog Strongjaw,

03:23:35.872 --> 03:23:43.604
shall be entitled to any libation of his choosing
at any pub, tavern, restaurant, inn, alehouse,

03:23:43.604 --> 03:23:52.421
brewery, or house of lady favors within the city
limits of Ank'Harel. He shall be allowed to drink

03:23:52.421 --> 03:23:58.602
until drunk, and enjoy no molestation by any
employee of said establishment, unless he requests

03:23:58.602 --> 03:24:06.189
it. All charges and bills related to his drinking,
cavorting, or violent behavior resulting from

03:24:06.189 --> 03:24:12.989
drunkenness, shall be forwarded to the Meat Man
for timely payment in full. By complying with this

03:24:12.989 --> 03:24:19.553
request, you are hereby under the protection of
the Meat Man, and shall receive all the benefits

03:24:19.553 --> 03:24:30.355
and goodwill accompanying such association. The
Meat Man always remembers. Sincerely, Aes Adon.

03:24:30.355 --> 03:24:40.649
TRAVIS: Probably best to test it out. See if it's
even worth anything.

03:24:40.649 --> 03:24:53.770
SAM: Grog, I love you. I'm sorry that we won't get
to hang out, because you hate me now. But I would

03:24:53.770 --> 03:24:58.454
never replace you. And if you ask me right now--

03:24:58.454 --> 03:25:00.057
TRAVIS: You'll kill him?

03:25:00.057 --> 03:25:01.836
SAM: I will kill him.

03:25:01.836 --> 03:25:06.859
JON: Who?

03:25:06.859 --> 03:25:09.003
(hushed laughter)

03:25:09.003 --> 03:25:10.720
TALIESIN: (quietly) I wouldn't worry about it.

03:25:10.720 --> 03:25:13.122
JON: Okay. I really like this job.

03:25:13.122 --> 03:25:14.428
TRAVIS: He's all right.

03:25:14.428 --> 03:25:17.827
(hushed laughter)

03:25:17.827 --> 03:25:21.971
SAM: Will you go drinking with me some time?

03:25:21.971 --> 03:25:32.575
TRAVIS: We'll see. By the way, I want you to know:
when you died, I sang a song I would never sing

03:25:32.575 --> 03:25:36.010
for anyone else, and I'm sorry you didn't hear it,
but it was really hard.

03:25:36.010 --> 03:25:37.904
SAM: Is that true?

03:25:37.904 --> 03:25:39.607
LAURA and LIAM: Yes.

03:25:39.607 --> 03:25:41.186
SAM: He sang?

03:25:41.186 --> 03:25:42.433
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:25:42.433 --> 03:25:44.188
JON: Do a truthful check.

03:25:44.188 --> 03:25:45.729
LAURA: Do you know what he sang?

03:25:45.729 --> 03:25:51.428
SAM: A truthful check? Sure, I'll roll a truthful
check.

03:25:51.428 --> 03:25:54.528
MATT: An insight check? Okay.

03:25:54.528 --> 03:25:55.841
SAM: Natural 20.

03:25:55.841 --> 03:25:56.898
LAURA: Whoa.

03:25:56.898 --> 03:26:01.950
MATT: Honest as the day, or Grog dick is long, he
apparently sang.

03:26:01.950 --> 03:26:05.150
TRAVIS: It is, I can just lean forward.

03:26:05.150 --> 03:26:06.437
MARISHA: Happy 100th.

03:26:06.437 --> 03:26:07.575
MATT: Happy 100th.

03:26:07.575 --> 03:26:09.669
(laughter)

03:26:09.669 --> 03:26:13.431
LAURA: Grog, I didn't hear it. Maybe you should
sing it, and let him know what it was.

03:26:13.431 --> 03:26:15.756
TRAVIS: Oh, you know, it's like the face of death
in the hallway,

03:26:15.756 --> 03:26:17.653
once it uses up its power, it's done.

03:26:17.653 --> 03:26:29.676
SAM: I'm so sorry I missed it. And I hope someday
we'll sing together, in a drunken stupor together.

03:26:29.676 --> 03:26:33.107
Maybe that will remind you.

03:26:33.107 --> 03:26:35.644
TRAVIS: Maybe.

03:26:35.644 --> 03:26:43.437
SAM: I was an asshole, Grog, I'm sorry. I would
never, never replace you, ever.

03:26:43.437 --> 03:26:45.313
You're irreplaceable.

03:26:45.313 --> 03:26:47.891
ASHLEY: And he could've read this, by the way.

03:26:47.891 --> 03:26:50.311
SAM: That's incredible.

03:26:50.311 --> 03:26:52.654
TRAVIS: I would've gotten the name right.

03:26:52.654 --> 03:26:58.441
MARISHA: Wait, did you frame it like a coupon
book? That's very impressive.

03:26:58.441 --> 03:27:00.190
SAM: I had some time last night.

03:27:00.190 --> 03:27:04.136
ASHLEY: Coupons, that you can sort of pick out of
it like a--

03:27:04.136 --> 03:27:06.078
LAURA: A free massage.

03:27:06.078 --> 03:27:10.503
MARISHA: Like a couple on Valentine's Day. Who
forgot it was Valentine's Day.

03:27:10.503 --> 03:27:13.758
ASHLEY: It looks like there's a free steak.

03:27:13.758 --> 03:27:20.844
SAM: Listen, we need to go kill some things right
now, but I just want to say to all of you, I'm so

03:27:20.844 --> 03:27:26.837
sorry the way I left, it was awful of me.
Percival, I said awful things to you, I said awful

03:27:26.837 --> 03:27:33.384
things to all of you. But just know I've done and
said worse things to Kaylee, and she's forgiven

03:27:33.384 --> 03:27:40.056
me, and I've done and said worse things to myself,
and I've managed to forgive myself, and I hope

03:27:40.056 --> 03:27:48.269
that someday, you'll all be able to forgive me.
And until then, I'll just keep trying, and that's

03:27:48.269 --> 03:27:54.652
all I can do. And after this fight, if you want me
to stay, and you guys go home, that's fine. But if

03:27:54.652 --> 03:27:57.790
not, maybe we can start over.

03:27:57.790 --> 03:28:04.548
MATT: Vex, Vax, Keyleth. At this moment, you hear
what sounds like footsteps making their way up the

03:28:04.548 --> 03:28:09.972
tunnel. Not where the light was before, but the
path you previously stepped from.

03:28:09.972 --> 03:28:12.166
MARISHA: Does it sound like skeletons, or
heavier?

03:28:12.166 --> 03:28:18.061
MATT: From just your passing hearing, it just
sounds like patterned footsteps.

03:28:18.061 --> 03:28:19.786
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on everybody.

03:28:19.786 --> 03:28:20.757
MATT: Okay.

03:28:20.757 --> 03:28:22.078
LIAM: Everybody quiet down.

03:28:22.078 --> 03:28:26.392
MARISHA: We're inside a glowing door, I think they
know where we are.

03:28:26.392 --> 03:28:32.624
MATT: So, you guys all close the door to the
mansion.

03:28:32.624 --> 03:28:37.567
LAURA: Well, I don't want to close the door to the
mansion, but turn out the lights in the mansion so

03:28:37.567 --> 03:28:38.983
you can't see.

03:28:38.983 --> 03:28:43.186
MARISHA: No one's home! We're out of candy, no
trick-or-treating.

03:28:43.186 --> 03:28:52.194
MATT: Up the hall, you watch as two humanoid
figures with hoods are carrying each side of what

03:28:52.194 --> 03:28:59.925
looks like a chest or a crate that has handles.
They just pass and then continue going.

03:28:59.925 --> 03:29:05.076
SAM: (whispering) You've seen that? You've seen
that? Those are the guys?

03:29:05.076 --> 03:29:06.748
JON: (whispering) Those are the guys.

03:29:06.748 --> 03:29:09.309
SAM: (whispering) We should kill him. Let's go
kill them.

03:29:09.309 --> 03:29:11.448
LIAM: (whispering) Can I murder one first?

03:29:11.448 --> 03:29:12.530
TALIESIN: (whispering) Yes.

03:29:12.530 --> 03:29:13.602
LIAM: (whispering) Thank you.

03:29:13.602 --> 03:29:15.010
LAURA: (whispering) Wait, I shoot--

03:29:15.010 --> 03:29:16.727
MATT: You're still inside the mansion.

03:29:16.727 --> 03:29:19.078
LIAM: I thought she said the door was just barely
open.

03:29:19.078 --> 03:29:23.047
MATT: Yeah, but they're not walking by; you made
the door way back in the tunnel. You see them up

03:29:23.047 --> 03:29:27.271
toward the T-juncture. So you guys would have to
leave the mansion and get there quickly.

03:29:27.271 --> 03:29:29.156
LAURA: Shit. We sneak out. We sneak out and shoot
them from behind.

03:29:29.156 --> 03:29:31.498
MATT: All right, stealth check for those who are
moving forward.

03:29:31.498 --> 03:29:32.675
SAM: Maybe we should all go.

03:29:32.675 --> 03:29:34.042
LIAM: Now, wait a second.

03:29:34.042 --> 03:29:37.402
LAURA: If you feel like it, you can go. This is a
team.

03:29:37.402 --> 03:29:38.813
TRAVIS: You Pass-Without-a-Traced us, right?

03:29:38.813 --> 03:29:40.163
LAURA: Yeah.

03:29:40.163 --> 03:29:45.485
MATT: Those who are moving forward, stealth
check?

03:29:45.485 --> 03:29:46.794
LIAM: 43.

03:29:46.794 --> 03:29:48.218
MATT: Happy hundredth.

03:29:48.218 --> 03:29:49.450
MARISHA: 24.

03:29:49.450 --> 03:29:50.665
LAURA: 27.

03:29:50.665 --> 03:29:52.327
MATT: Anybody else moving forward with them?

03:29:52.327 --> 03:29:56.121
TALIESIN: I'm a little bit behind them. 28.

03:29:56.121 --> 03:29:58.572
SAM: Wait, are we all going?

03:29:58.572 --> 03:30:00.075
MATT: Up to you guys. Whoever's going?

03:30:00.075 --> 03:30:03.058
SAM: Did everyone else leave?

03:30:03.058 --> 03:30:04.478
JON: 20.

03:30:04.478 --> 03:30:06.118
SAM: If he's going, I'm going.

03:30:06.118 --> 03:30:07.362
TALIESIN: I'm behind you guys.

03:30:07.362 --> 03:30:08.544
SAM: Natural 20.

03:30:08.544 --> 03:30:10.274
LIAM: Twins are in the front.

03:30:10.274 --> 03:30:12.414
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're letting them go first.

03:30:12.414 --> 03:30:14.637
JON: Oh, I'm behind, but I'm going.

03:30:14.637 --> 03:30:17.384
MATT: You do have advantage on your stealth
checks because of your boots, Pike.

03:30:17.384 --> 03:30:22.386
MARISHA: Table right is hanging back behind the
twins.

03:30:22.386 --> 03:30:24.730
ASHLEY: 16.

03:30:24.730 --> 03:30:26.097
LAURA: Plus ten?

03:30:26.097 --> 03:30:28.203
ASHLEY: Oh, 26!

03:30:28.203 --> 03:30:30.924
MATT: All right, everyone got above 20.

03:30:30.924 --> 03:30:32.439
SAM: Taryon's still asleep.

03:30:32.439 --> 03:30:33.871
LAURA: No!

03:30:33.871 --> 03:30:43.260
MATT: Taryon is still asleep. Okay. All right, so.
You carefully move forward. The twins, you, at

03:30:43.260 --> 03:30:47.259
full stealthing pace, make it up to the corner,
and as you crest around the side, about 20, 25

03:30:47.259 --> 03:30:53.389
feet up, you see the two humanoid figures with
hoods that come to a underoff point that hangs to

03:30:53.389 --> 03:30:57.823
one side. Looks like a leathery or rubbery
substance from the little bit of light that's

03:30:57.823 --> 03:31:03.518
coming through, it's hard to really tell. They're
wearing long black cloth, like a tunic, and what

03:31:03.518 --> 03:31:09.618
looks to be dark leather or thick black cloth,
pants and boots.

03:31:09.618 --> 03:31:12.397
LAURA: Pants and boots and pants.

03:31:12.397 --> 03:31:16.312
MATT: Boots and pants and boots and pants. Not
gloved hands, but they're both just carrying this

03:31:16.312 --> 03:31:18.245
chest along, they're just quietly moving along.

03:31:18.245 --> 03:31:19.997
LAURA: I bramble shot one of them.

03:31:19.997 --> 03:31:21.575
LIAM: (dagger throwing noise)

03:31:21.575 --> 03:31:26.635
MATT: Okay, so, roll for your attack. On the
one that's closest to you, or further?

03:31:26.635 --> 03:31:27.995
LIAM: On the left.

03:31:27.995 --> 03:31:29.610
MATT: Well, they're both moving away from you.

03:31:29.610 --> 03:31:30.551
LAURA and LIAM: Oh.

03:31:30.551 --> 03:31:31.642
LIAM: Well, you're further.

03:31:31.642 --> 03:31:32.697
LAURA: I'll go for the further one.

03:31:32.697 --> 03:31:34.378
TRAVIS: Please both be old people.

03:31:34.378 --> 03:31:36.419
(laughter)

03:31:36.419 --> 03:31:38.732
LAURA: Should I roll two for attack?

03:31:38.732 --> 03:31:41.143
MATT: Yeah, because they do not know you're there,
so you have advantage.

03:31:41.143 --> 03:31:42.794
LAURA: Ooh.

03:31:42.794 --> 03:31:45.172
LIAM: 29.

03:31:45.172 --> 03:31:46.377
MATT: That hits.

03:31:46.377 --> 03:31:47.859
LIAM: And this is assassinate, critical hit.

03:31:47.859 --> 03:31:49.111
MATT: Yes it is, it's an auto crit.

03:31:49.111 --> 03:31:51.791
LAURA: So, Oh! I'm an assassin too!

03:31:51.791 --> 03:31:52.874
MATT: Correct.

03:31:52.874 --> 03:31:54.299
LAURA: So I get an automatic?

03:31:54.299 --> 03:31:58.084
MATT: Auto crit. If you're a level three, you do.
So both you guys auto crit.

03:31:58.084 --> 03:32:02.091
LAURA: Sweet!! Ooh, so I double all my dice?

03:32:02.091 --> 03:32:03.262
MATT: Yep, including the bramble shot.

03:32:03.262 --> 03:32:04.414
LAURA: Oh shit!

03:32:04.414 --> 03:32:12.020
TALIESIN: That's the end of both of them. It's
going to be a cadaver and a fern.

03:32:12.020 --> 03:32:20.956
MARISHA: Oh, new chest. We could put our blankets
in it.

03:32:20.956 --> 03:32:25.354
TALIESIN: I'm working on a quilt.

03:32:25.354 --> 03:32:27.547
MARISHA: I was going to say, the quilt from your
grandmother.

03:32:27.547 --> 03:32:35.834
JON: This thing must be worth them dying for.

03:32:35.834 --> 03:32:37.967
LAURA: 66 on the first hit.

03:32:37.967 --> 03:32:40.092
MATT: 66 damage?

03:32:40.092 --> 03:32:41.430
LAURA: For the arrow, yeah.

03:32:41.430 --> 03:32:43.135
LIAM: 78 on the first hit.

03:32:43.135 --> 03:32:47.237
LAURA: Oh wait, I didn't do my sneak attack
damage! (cackling)

03:32:47.237 --> 03:32:48.917
JON: They can just obliterate anything?

03:32:48.917 --> 03:32:50.811
TALIESIN: Yeah, they're monsters.

03:32:50.811 --> 03:32:54.453
LIAM: And I use a bonus action for an offhand
attack. And I got a critical on it.

03:32:54.453 --> 03:32:57.077
I rolled a 20.

03:32:57.077 --> 03:32:59.918
MATT: You rolled a 20 on the second one? Okay.
Roll damage on that.

03:32:59.918 --> 03:33:02.918
LAURA: 76 for the first hit.

03:33:02.918 --> 03:33:12.611
MATT: Okay. In an instant-- don't worry about the
second attack, critical damage. Both of them just

03:33:12.611 --> 03:33:15.845
go-- (footsteps) (thud)

03:33:15.845 --> 03:33:17.616
(laughter)

03:33:17.616 --> 03:33:24.854
ASHLEY: What's in the box?

03:33:24.854 --> 03:33:26.285
TRAVIS: What's in the box?

03:33:26.285 --> 03:33:28.532
MATT: You lift up the box--

03:33:28.532 --> 03:33:30.151
LAURA: We check it for traps.

03:33:30.151 --> 03:33:31.720
MATT: Okay, investigation check.

03:33:31.720 --> 03:33:33.979
LIAM: Let's both check.

03:33:33.979 --> 03:33:35.114
LAURA: Okay.

03:33:35.114 --> 03:33:36.297
LIAM: Natural 20.

03:33:36.297 --> 03:33:43.458
MATT: What the fuck? You guys tonight. Talk about
the hundredth episode mojo here. Unless you're

03:33:43.458 --> 03:33:44.744
Grog. Sorry, buddy.

03:33:44.744 --> 03:33:47.012
TRAVIS: Fucking leave it in the past!

03:33:47.012 --> 03:33:53.386
MATT: All righty, so. Who rolled investigation on
that one?

03:33:53.386 --> 03:33:54.574
LAURA: He did.

03:33:54.574 --> 03:33:55.557
MATT: What did you get?

03:33:55.557 --> 03:33:56.409
LIAM: 20.

03:33:56.409 --> 03:33:59.473
MATT: 20. Natural, oh that's right, (blows
raspberry) I'm stupid. Yeah, no, it is not

03:33:59.473 --> 03:34:01.506
trapped, it's not locked, it's just closed.

03:34:01.506 --> 03:34:02.584
LIAM: Spick and span.

03:34:02.584 --> 03:34:10.464
MATT: Inside you see what looks like a polished
stone of smooth jade that is affixed to a grey

03:34:10.464 --> 03:34:17.896
leather band that loops in the back. You see a
scimitar, a very well-made scimitar, that has a

03:34:17.896 --> 03:34:26.535
series of pearlescent gems across the hilt, it has
a very Marquesian flair to it. And you see what

03:34:26.535 --> 03:34:31.286
appears to be a rusty iron sphere that is about
three inches in diameter and weighs about a pound.

03:34:31.286 --> 03:34:36.725
It has a bunch of really strange shapes and
design, almost like it was made from condensed

03:34:36.725 --> 03:34:39.008
chains that were then melted down into a single
sphere.

03:34:39.008 --> 03:34:40.859
It has a really rough texture on the outside.

03:34:40.859 --> 03:34:46.332
LAURA: We need to have Tary Identify it. Can we
drag the box back to the mansion?

03:34:46.332 --> 03:34:51.959
MATT: Yeah, you drag it back (dragging noises). I
mean, the box has some food and blankets that are

03:34:51.959 --> 03:34:56.878
meant to keep it hidden, so you search through as
you find them. Those are the only things of

03:34:56.878 --> 03:34:59.277
interest in the box, the rest of it just seems to
be to fill the space.

03:34:59.277 --> 03:35:00.744
LAURA: Can we hide the bodies?

03:35:00.744 --> 03:35:02.848
MATT: Sure. You guys drag the bodies back?

03:35:02.848 --> 03:35:07.052
LAURA: Yeah. And Dust of Tracelessness to hide
where they were dragged.

03:35:07.052 --> 03:35:08.617
TALIESIN: I'm going to take their cloaks.

03:35:08.617 --> 03:35:10.181
TRAVIS: You want me to hide the bodies?

03:35:10.181 --> 03:35:11.037
LAURA: Yeah, Grog.

03:35:11.037 --> 03:35:12.593
TRAVIS: I put the bodies in the Bag of Holding.

03:35:12.593 --> 03:35:15.099
(laughter)

03:35:15.099 --> 03:35:19.571
MATT: Okay. The opening is about that big, so it
takes you a second, just like when you had to put

03:35:19.571 --> 03:35:26.692
Dork the Ox in there, it's like trying to fit a
king-sized pillow in a twin-sized pillowcase.

03:35:26.692 --> 03:35:32.167
TALIESIN: I fully support it. Whatever you need to
do to feel better, man.

03:35:32.167 --> 03:35:35.132
TRAVIS: I'm trying to get over these double ones,
man, I'm working it out.

03:35:35.132 --> 03:35:38.349
TALIESIN: I'm curious about a couple things here.

03:35:38.349 --> 03:35:41.822
LAURA: Don't touch any of it, until we get Tary to
look at it.

03:35:41.822 --> 03:35:44.725
MARISHA: While they drag the bodies back, Percy
and I take the robes.

03:35:44.725 --> 03:35:50.038
TALIESIN: We're going to strip the cult members of
their culty pants.

03:35:50.038 --> 03:35:53.386
MATT: So, Percival and Keyleth are currently
wearing--

03:35:53.386 --> 03:35:59.037
MARISHA: Can I study one of the guys' face, and
take that for Alter Self?

03:35:59.037 --> 03:36:05.034
MATT: Sure, easy enough. You also find that both
of them have what looks like a dark iron symbol

03:36:05.034 --> 03:36:12.194
hanging around their neck, hidden beneath their
robes. It resembles a four-pronged pitchfork that

03:36:12.194 --> 03:36:15.069
has a single rod beneath it that forms a loop.

03:36:15.069 --> 03:36:17.289
LAURA: Do you have a picture?

03:36:17.289 --> 03:36:18.844
MATT: I'm going to sketch it for you.

03:36:18.844 --> 03:36:20.980
SAM: Dickbutt.

03:36:20.980 --> 03:36:28.118
LAURA: I spilled coffee on my paper, and it looks
like David Mack watercolor.

03:36:28.118 --> 03:36:30.689
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, it's aged a little.

03:36:30.689 --> 03:36:32.690
LIAM: Mack spatter.

03:36:32.690 --> 03:36:36.924
SAM: Hey, in the store tonight, we've got lots
of--

03:36:36.924 --> 03:36:38.638
MATT: It looks like that.

03:36:38.638 --> 03:36:42.819
TALIESIN: Angry happy face with a goatee.

03:36:42.819 --> 03:36:48.759
MATT: Kind of, yeah. So you have the corpses both
being stuffed into the Bag of Holding, you guys

03:36:48.759 --> 03:36:51.789
find the whatever symbols are hanging, and the
robes are on you.

03:36:51.789 --> 03:36:53.456
LAURA: We go back to Tary.

03:36:53.456 --> 03:36:54.900
MATT: You go back to Tary.

03:36:54.900 --> 03:36:59.846
SAM: (as Tary) 34, 35. Other side, Doty. One.

03:36:59.846 --> 03:37:02.545
LAURA: Tary? We're in the mansion. Tary?

03:37:02.545 --> 03:37:04.751
SAM: Hello? Yes? I'm not decent yet.

03:37:04.751 --> 03:37:06.877
LAURA: Tary. I've seen you naked.

03:37:06.877 --> 03:37:09.863
SAM: Come in, come in. Hello.

03:37:09.863 --> 03:37:14.142
LIAM: Thank you. We have a box of crazy shit, will
you look at it and tell us what we're looking at?

03:37:14.142 --> 03:37:15.222
SAM: Of course.

03:37:15.222 --> 03:37:18.110
LAURA: What are you doing in here, why didn't you
come down with us?

03:37:18.110 --> 03:37:23.962
SAM: I'm doing my daily preparations. I had to
pluck my eyebrows, I had to comb my hair. My

03:37:23.962 --> 03:37:26.230
unmentionables needed to be washed and--

03:37:26.230 --> 03:37:27.553
JON: Waxed?

03:37:27.553 --> 03:37:33.077
SAM: Yes. I will identify these objects.

03:37:33.077 --> 03:37:36.869
MATT: Easy enough to do as a ritual for each. The
scimitar is a Scimitar of Speed.

03:37:36.869 --> 03:37:38.813
TALIESIN: I'm excited.

03:37:38.813 --> 03:37:40.539
SAM: Oh, oh. I'm jacked in.

03:37:40.539 --> 03:37:43.577
LAURA: You can go, you can go, you've got 30 feet
of jack.

03:37:43.577 --> 03:37:47.322
MATT: All right, don't go so far. These are the
other two items you've got.

03:37:47.322 --> 03:37:48.966
SAM: Oh my god, there's so many items.

03:37:48.966 --> 03:37:51.664
LAURA: Whoa, go us!

03:37:51.664 --> 03:37:56.632
SAM: What we have here is a Scimitar of Speed. You
gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made

03:37:56.632 --> 03:38:01.849
with this magical weapon. In addition, you can
make one attack with it as a bonus action on each

03:38:01.849 --> 03:38:02.938
of your turns.

03:38:02.938 --> 03:38:04.899
LAURA: Shut up. Is it attunable? Do you have to
attune it?

03:38:04.899 --> 03:38:06.345
TALIESIN: Yes, you do.

03:38:06.345 --> 03:38:14.047
SAM: But maybe this guy can do it. We've also
found the Third Eye of Awareness. A single

03:38:14.047 --> 03:38:19.418
polished stone of smooth jade is affixed to a grey
leather band that loops in the back. The wearer

03:38:19.418 --> 03:38:21.309
gains advantage on initiative.

03:38:21.309 --> 03:38:22.550
(gasps)

03:38:22.550 --> 03:38:24.204
SAM: Not attunable.

03:38:24.204 --> 03:38:25.656
(louder excited gasps)

03:38:25.656 --> 03:38:27.225
LAURA: We're in the room, we're in the room!

03:38:27.225 --> 03:38:29.858
LIAM: Tary, I am an assassin of the highest
caliber.

03:38:29.858 --> 03:38:32.044
LAURA: Tary. I'm your best friend.

03:38:32.044 --> 03:38:36.610
SAM: Oh. Little Elf Girl.

03:38:36.610 --> 03:38:38.470
LAURA: Oh wait, is it a necklace?

03:38:38.470 --> 03:38:42.198
SAM: No, it's a leather band.

03:38:42.198 --> 03:38:43.937
MATT: It's a headband.

03:38:43.937 --> 03:38:49.358
SAM: Of course Vex gets this. All the times we've
had together.

03:38:49.358 --> 03:38:58.005
JON: What are the other Eyes of Awareness? Have
you guys come across the others? It says that's

03:38:58.005 --> 03:38:59.410
the third one.

03:38:59.410 --> 03:39:06.458
SAM: The last item is called the Iron Bands of
Bilarro. This rusty iron sphere measures three

03:39:06.458 --> 03:39:10.039
inches in diameter, and weighs one pound. Like my
dick.

03:39:10.039 --> 03:39:11.961
(laughter)

03:39:11.961 --> 03:39:14.095
LIAM: It says that on the paper, Matt?

03:39:14.095 --> 03:39:18.725
MATT: I didn't-- no-- I didn't-- Wait-- No.

03:39:18.725 --> 03:39:20.495
MARISHA: Wait, does that require attunement?

03:39:20.495 --> 03:39:26.073
SAM: You can use an action to speak the command
word and throw the sphere at a huge or smaller

03:39:26.073 --> 03:39:32.597
creature, like my dick, that you can see within 60
feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air,

03:39:32.597 --> 03:39:38.042
it opens into a tangle of metal bands, like my
dick. Make a ranged attack roll with an attack

03:39:38.042 --> 03:39:43.534
bonus equal to your dex modifier plus your blah
blah blah, if you hit it, the target is restrained

03:39:43.534 --> 03:39:49.154
until you take a bonus action to speak a command
word and release it. Doing so, or missing, causes

03:39:49.154 --> 03:39:53.769
the bands to contract and become a sphere once
more. So it's like a trap ball. Trap ball.

03:39:53.769 --> 03:40:01.220
MATT: It's like, you know in Doctor Strange, that
prison exoskeleton it threw on him?

03:40:01.220 --> 03:40:02.418
It's like that.

03:40:02.418 --> 03:40:07.234
SAM: Once the band is used, it can't be used again
until the next dawn, like my dick.

03:40:07.234 --> 03:40:14.212
LAURA: Tary, you've never been quite so obsessed
with your dick before.

03:40:14.212 --> 03:40:20.183
SAM: It's just that gnome, he's so weird and he
rubs off on people, like my dick!

03:40:20.183 --> 03:40:21.542
Oh, I'm doing it again!

03:40:21.542 --> 03:40:24.610
LAURA: You're doing it! How are you? You've been
hiding a lot!

03:40:24.610 --> 03:40:29.781
SAM: Well, it seems like you guys are working
through a thing, and I should really be getting

03:40:29.781 --> 03:40:35.639
back home, anyway. I don't know, I don't feel
quite as needed any more.

03:40:35.639 --> 03:40:36.910
LAURA: Oh no!

03:40:36.910 --> 03:40:38.415
JON: You're not, I don't think.

03:40:38.415 --> 03:40:39.375
LAURA: You're not there!

03:40:39.419 --> 03:40:41.029
SAM: How did he get in here?

03:40:41.029 --> 03:40:43.626
MATT: You turn around and realize that Lionel has
followed you into the room.

03:40:43.626 --> 03:40:46.725
JON: What else do I have to do?

03:40:46.725 --> 03:40:55.104
SAM: After this is all done, I'll say my proper
goodbyes. But I should be going. He's your best

03:40:55.104 --> 03:40:59.091
guy, right? You need him. He's part of the team,
he always has been.

03:40:59.091 --> 03:41:01.005
LAURA: &lt;i&gt;You're&lt;/i&gt; my best guy!

03:41:01.005 --> 03:41:09.060
SAM: I love you both. I'm definitely poorer for
having known you, though.

03:41:09.060 --> 03:41:16.186
LAURA: I mean, you were poorer without knowing us,
you just didn't realize it.

03:41:16.186 --> 03:41:17.893
LIAM: I mean, poorer, but richer.

03:41:17.893 --> 03:41:19.596
SAM: That's true.

03:41:19.596 --> 03:41:22.264
TRAVIS: Your family's actually poorer because of
you.

03:41:22.264 --> 03:41:27.913
LAURA: This mansion disappears in 24 hours, so you
can't just hide in here.

03:41:27.913 --> 03:41:36.006
SAM: All right, I'll come outside. Doty, get my
armor ready. Spritz it!

03:41:36.006 --> 03:41:44.015
MATT: "Tary." Doty pulls an arm up, and you can
see one of the slight changes that they had made

03:41:44.015 --> 03:41:49.561
in his construction is a slight mister on the
other hand that goes (water spraying).

03:41:49.561 --> 03:41:52.537
TRAVIS: For your face or for your armor?

03:41:52.537 --> 03:41:54.032
SAM: His armor!

03:41:54.032 --> 03:41:54.804
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

03:41:54.804 --> 03:41:56.489
MATT: Depends how hot the day is.

03:41:56.489 --> 03:41:58.285
LIAM: Freddie! Where's Fred?

03:41:58.285 --> 03:42:04.265
LAURA: I feel like Percy would like this a lot. We
found something that you might enjoy.

03:42:04.265 --> 03:42:06.457
LIAM: What's this?

03:42:06.457 --> 03:42:08.115
TALIESIN: Scimitar of Speed.

03:42:08.115 --> 03:42:13.464
LIAM: Well, I think you might like this thing. You
could come up with

03:42:13.464 --> 03:42:15.873
very creative solutions with that.

03:42:15.873 --> 03:42:23.030
TALIESIN: This could go-- (interested noises) Yes.
Yes, I think I could do something with this.

03:42:23.030 --> 03:42:32.106
SAM: Let's go kill some shit, shall we? Come on!

03:42:32.106 --> 03:42:34.325
TALIESIN: I've even got a codeword for it!

03:42:34.325 --> 03:42:35.398
SAM: Codeword?

03:42:35.398 --> 03:42:36.468
MARISHA: There's a codeword?

03:42:36.468 --> 03:42:38.377
TALIESIN: You have to speak a word to make it
work.

03:42:38.377 --> 03:42:39.603
MATT: A command word, yeah.

03:42:39.603 --> 03:42:43.186
TALIESIN: Can I program the word? I've programmed
it. Perfect.

03:42:43.186 --> 03:42:45.794
LAURA: I put this on.

03:42:45.794 --> 03:42:51.371
MATT: Okay, you put that on. All right. Who is
going where? What are you doing?

03:42:51.371 --> 03:42:56.922
LIAM: Wait, hold on. Would you like this, either
of you? It's not my bag.

03:42:56.922 --> 03:43:02.247
ASHLEY: Gain a plus two bonus to attack... It's a
weapon.

03:43:02.247 --> 03:43:07.084
MATT: All right, so what's the plan, guys? What
are you doing?

03:43:07.084 --> 03:43:08.761
LIAM: We should go.

03:43:08.761 --> 03:43:10.263
LAURA: We should go attack things.

03:43:10.263 --> 03:43:11.288
TRAVIS: Campfire!

03:43:11.288 --> 03:43:14.351
LIAM: Well, let's go quietly, you and I, take
point.

03:43:14.351 --> 03:43:19.717
LAURA: And head deeper in, see where the people
have been.

03:43:19.717 --> 03:43:21.130
LIAM: Twins are in the lead.

03:43:21.130 --> 03:43:23.094
MATT: New stealth checks from you guys since
you've had combat.

03:43:23.094 --> 03:43:24.819
LAURA: Still have Pass Without a Trace going.

03:43:24.819 --> 03:43:27.289
TALIESIN: Everybody roll who's walking.

03:43:27.289 --> 03:43:30.625
MATT: Sam, are you bringing Scanlan?

03:43:30.625 --> 03:43:32.736
LAURA: Natural 20!

03:43:32.736 --> 03:43:38.352
MATT: So, across the board.

03:43:38.352 --> 03:43:40.170
TRAVIS: What are we rolling?

03:43:40.170 --> 03:43:41.306
MATT: Stealth.

03:43:41.306 --> 03:43:42.720
TRAVIS: Oh, I did that already. 23.

03:43:42.720 --> 03:43:45.900
ASHLEY: 35!

03:43:45.900 --> 03:43:49.619
LAURA: Natural 20.

03:43:49.619 --> 03:43:53.897
LIAM: I rolled a two, so it's a 27.

03:43:53.897 --> 03:43:56.482
MATT: Reliable Talent, man, it's awesome.

03:43:56.482 --> 03:43:57.545
MARISHA: 29.

03:43:57.545 --> 03:43:58.897
TALIESIN: 23.

03:43:58.897 --> 03:44:00.063
JON: 19.

03:44:00.063 --> 03:44:00.969
MATT: Plus ten.

03:44:00.969 --> 03:44:02.243
JON: Yeah, that was with ten.

03:44:02.243 --> 03:44:04.093
SAM: 20, 23, 23.

03:44:04.093 --> 03:44:05.731
MATT: Okay!

03:44:05.731 --> 03:44:06.776
ASHLEY: Question!

03:44:06.776 --> 03:44:12.244
SAM: Scanlan, Taryon, Doty. I tried to leave them
behind, guys!

03:44:12.244 --> 03:44:16.723
LAURA: But he's in a mansion, he'll just pop out
and then he'll be sitting in a tunnel by himself!

03:44:16.723 --> 03:44:18.599
TRAVIS: You opened this hole, man, you gotta pay
for it!

03:44:18.599 --> 03:44:20.020
LIAM: Yeah, you've got to juggle these balls.

03:44:20.176 --> 03:44:21.384
MATT: All righty.

03:44:21.443 --> 03:44:25.856
LAURA: Sorry, Matt. What do we do? He's going to
kill him! He's going to kill one of them! What

03:44:25.856 --> 03:44:29.033
should we do?

03:44:29.033 --> 03:44:30.377
SAM: Let's go!

03:44:30.377 --> 03:44:32.424
MATT: You move further into the tunnel.

03:44:32.424 --> 03:44:36.107
LIAM: Twins in the lead, point, traps. All that.

03:44:36.107 --> 03:44:37.125
MATT: All right.

03:44:37.125 --> 03:44:39.915
LAURA: Searching, keeping an eye out for any other
people as well.

03:44:39.915 --> 03:44:47.949
MATT: All right, it's only 80 feet until the
winding tunnel opens up slightly. So, make another

03:44:47.949 --> 03:44:51.087
investigation check partway up, about halfway to
that period.

03:44:51.087 --> 03:44:52.674
LAURA: God damn it.

03:44:52.674 --> 03:44:53.832
LIAM: 18.

03:44:53.832 --> 03:45:09.317
MATT: Okay. You make your way there. And you begin
to push towards the entranceway. The soft dust on

03:45:09.317 --> 03:45:16.818
the ground, which is the same color as the rest of
the stonework. Vax, you step onto one section that

03:45:16.818 --> 03:45:22.709
seems to step in a little further than the others, and you
feel a (click).

03:45:22.709 --> 03:45:25.651
LIAM: Nobody move. Don't move.

03:45:25.651 --> 03:45:30.550
MATT: I need you and Vex, and who was following
them?

03:45:30.550 --> 03:45:32.780
SAM: Everybody.

03:45:32.780 --> 03:45:36.909
MATT: I need everybody to make a constitution
saving throw.

03:45:36.909 --> 03:45:38.544
LAURA: Oh no.

03:45:38.544 --> 03:45:45.203
SAM: Saving throws are up there.

03:45:45.203 --> 03:45:48.262
LIAM: Sam. I'm using my first Luck of the new day.
Okay?

03:45:48.262 --> 03:45:50.113
SAM: Great. That's the third one, then?

03:45:50.113 --> 03:45:52.550
LIAM: The first one of the day.

03:45:52.550 --> 03:45:56.166
TALIESIN: Oh, I can reroll a saving throw.

03:45:56.166 --> 03:46:02.530
MATT: All right. Grog?

03:46:02.530 --> 03:46:03.979
TRAVIS: 17.

03:46:03.979 --> 03:46:07.067
MATT: 17. You take 36 points of necrotic damage.
Pike?

03:46:07.067 --> 03:46:08.250
ASHLEY: Five.

03:46:08.250 --> 03:46:09.783
MATT: 36 points of necrotic damage.

03:46:09.783 --> 03:46:11.466
LIAM: Constitution saving throw?

03:46:11.466 --> 03:46:12.919
MATT: Yep. Vex?

03:46:12.919 --> 03:46:14.012
LAURA: 16?

03:46:14.012 --> 03:46:15.352
MATT: 36 points of necrotic damage.

03:46:15.352 --> 03:46:20.703
LIAM: 18, but armor after those faces, is set to
necrotic damage.

03:46:20.703 --> 03:46:27.743
MATT: Right, because you never un-set it from
that. Okay. All right, I'll let you do that. All

03:46:27.743 --> 03:46:32.527
right, so instead of 36, that's 18.

03:46:32.527 --> 03:46:34.172
LIAM: I rolled an 18.

03:46:34.172 --> 03:46:38.129
MATT: You did not succeed on the saving throw, but
you halved it.

03:46:38.129 --> 03:46:40.950
MARISHA: 20 total?

03:46:40.950 --> 03:46:44.305
MATT: 20 total? You take 16 points of necrotic
damage. You make it.

03:46:44.305 --> 03:46:47.530
TALIESIN: Out of curiosity, is this a magic saving
throw?

03:46:47.530 --> 03:46:51.167
MATT: Against a spell effect? Yes.

03:46:51.167 --> 03:46:55.302
TALIESIN: Then I don't even have to use a resolve.
19.

03:46:55.302 --> 03:46:58.182
MATT: 19 does not succeed. You take 36 points of
necrotic damage.

03:46:58.182 --> 03:46:59.790
JON: 16.

03:46:59.790 --> 03:47:01.300
MATT: 36 points of necrotic damage.

03:47:01.300 --> 03:47:04.337
TALIESIN: We don't have the bonus hit points,
either, do we?

03:47:04.337 --> 03:47:05.444
MATT: Nope.

03:47:05.444 --> 03:47:06.447
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:47:06.447 --> 03:47:07.828
SAM: Scanlan, 26.

03:47:07.828 --> 03:47:09.467
MATT: Takes 16 points of necrotic damage.

03:47:09.467 --> 03:47:11.510
SAM: Is it 18 points?

03:47:11.510 --> 03:47:12.923
MATT: Yes, 18.

03:47:12.923 --> 03:47:15.420
SAM: Taryon, 26.

03:47:15.420 --> 03:47:17.681
MATT: Wow. 18 points of necrotic damage.

03:47:17.681 --> 03:47:19.294
SAM: Doty, one.

03:47:19.294 --> 03:47:26.308
MATT: Doty takes 36 points of necrotic damage. All
righty. You watch as you pull back and the sand

03:47:26.308 --> 03:47:33.271
sifts in and you see another face below, with a
burst of dark energy that echoes out in a 60-foot

03:47:33.271 --> 03:47:38.667
radius. Fills the hallway with this high-pitched
shrieking sound. As it hits all of you and the

03:47:38.667 --> 03:47:45.927
breath escapes you for a second, this circle of
death-like sphere passes all of you, and you hear

03:47:45.927 --> 03:47:48.268
the shriek echo through both sides of the
hallway.

03:47:48.268 --> 03:47:53.699
LAURA: Well, if anything's going to bring more
skeletons, it's that.

03:47:53.699 --> 03:47:55.482
LIAM: Clicking my boots.

03:47:55.482 --> 03:48:01.378
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn my quick heal. Might
as well.

03:48:01.378 --> 03:48:04.401
MATT: What are you guys doing? Pushing forward,
staying where you are?

03:48:04.401 --> 03:48:08.753
LAURA: Should you heal us before we pop into
anything more? Can you heal us?

03:48:08.753 --> 03:48:10.560
ASHLEY: Yeah. I can heal us.

03:48:10.560 --> 03:48:11.953
LAURA: That was a lot.

03:48:11.953 --> 03:48:13.366
ASHLEY: That was a lot.

03:48:13.366 --> 03:48:14.682
LIAM: I'm doing this.

03:48:14.682 --> 03:48:17.405
MATT: Perception check.

03:48:17.405 --> 03:48:20.018
ASHLEY: I'll cast Mass Cure Wounds.

03:48:20.018 --> 03:48:24.057
TRAVIS: Pike's doing this.

03:48:24.057 --> 03:48:26.358
MATT: Mass Cure Wounds. How much does that heal
everybody?

03:48:26.358 --> 03:48:28.970
ASHLEY: 3d8 plus spellcasting ability modifier.

03:48:28.970 --> 03:48:32.521
MATT: So whatever you roll plus five.

03:48:32.521 --> 03:48:34.195
LIAM: 31 perception.

03:48:34.195 --> 03:48:43.407
MATT: Okay. You listen out, and you hear what
sounds like low voices, things shifting, a slight

03:48:43.407 --> 03:48:52.856
general humming sound. The bright light that was
there before is not there at the moment. You still

03:48:52.856 --> 03:48:54.200
see the fire.

03:48:54.200 --> 03:48:56.234
LIAM: Does it sound like anything I've ever heard
before?

03:48:56.234 --> 03:49:00.819
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

03:49:00.819 --> 03:49:04.226
ASHLEY: Everybody heals an extra 18 hit points.

03:49:04.226 --> 03:49:05.780
LIAM: Natural 20.

03:49:05.780 --> 03:49:13.231
MATT: Natural 20. You do remember it. The low hum
that temporarily appears was very close to the

03:49:13.231 --> 03:49:16.906
sound whenever anybody was throwing something into
the dark sphere above the ziggurat.

03:49:16.906 --> 03:49:19.407
LIAM: I was wondering. All right.

03:49:19.407 --> 03:49:20.769
SAM: You said 18?

03:49:20.769 --> 03:49:21.910
ASHLEY: 18 points, yeah.

03:49:21.910 --> 03:49:23.068
JON: They've heard that before.

03:49:23.068 --> 03:49:25.351
MATT: Apparently. A different one.

03:49:25.351 --> 03:49:29.083
MARISHA: No one's rolled initiative. No one knows
we're here yet.

03:49:29.083 --> 03:49:34.106
MATT: Not yet. You haven't thrown into combat yet.
You guys just hit a trap and heard things ahead.

03:49:34.106 --> 03:49:39.368
MARISHA: If you can wait 60 seconds, I can make us
an elemental.

03:49:39.368 --> 03:49:44.264
TALIESIN: Will the magic fade if we get too close
to the ziggurat, though?

03:49:44.264 --> 03:49:49.120
LAURA: Maybe we'll have to fight things outside of
the ziggurat.

03:49:49.120 --> 03:49:55.329
MARISHA: That's a good question. I have a mild
confession, and maybe I should have said this a

03:49:55.329 --> 03:50:04.127
little earlier, but I'm going to say it now. One
night, I might have sneaked down into the middle

03:50:04.127 --> 03:50:07.398
of the ziggurat, and I stuck my hand in it.

03:50:07.398 --> 03:50:09.118
LAURA: What the fuck?

03:50:09.118 --> 03:50:10.767
SAM: Why would you do that, and what happened?

03:50:10.767 --> 03:50:17.546
MARISHA: Well, I wanted to find out what would
happen, and I found out it's real bad. It's really

03:50:17.546 --> 03:50:23.785
bad, is what I found out, and it nearly crushed my
hand to a point of oblivion and I think I got

03:50:23.785 --> 03:50:31.904
really lucky, so I think it just crushes anything
that it tries to suck in.

03:50:31.904 --> 03:50:34.847
LAURA: But it's a doorway. I shot an arrow through
it.

03:50:34.847 --> 03:50:40.128
MARISHA: It is. I think your arrow happened to be
tiny and fast.

03:50:40.128 --> 03:50:42.036
TALIESIN: Well.

03:50:42.036 --> 03:50:44.582
LIAM: Those 60 seconds have passed.

03:50:44.582 --> 03:50:45.746
TALIESIN: Let's go.

03:50:45.746 --> 03:50:51.326
MATT: You were talking instead of casting a spell.
Do you want to take

03:50:51.326 --> 03:50:53.211
another minute to cast a spell?

03:50:53.211 --> 03:50:55.333
TRAVIS: Thanks for the confession, though.

03:50:55.333 --> 03:50:57.490
MATT: All right, so what are you guys doing?

03:50:57.490 --> 03:51:00.291
LAURA: Moving forward. Keeping an eye out for
those--

03:51:00.291 --> 03:51:04.250
MARISHA: That's all I mean. Don't jump in.

03:51:04.250 --> 03:51:05.700
LIAM: Do you want to go elemental?

03:51:05.700 --> 03:51:06.880
LAURA: No, she wanted to summon an elemental.

03:51:06.880 --> 03:51:08.418
MARISHA: I wanted to summon an elemental.

03:51:08.418 --> 03:51:14.168
MATT: You guys rush forward, and a hot wind is
picking up through the tunnel. You're not quite

03:51:14.168 --> 03:51:19.334
sure directionally where it's coming from. But as
you move forward and through the winding passage,

03:51:19.334 --> 03:51:25.634
maybe 60 feet ahead as it opens up, you see it
splits into two different pathways of natural

03:51:25.634 --> 03:51:31.808
interior rock formations, and you can see a larger
chamber beyond that. You have the right and left.

03:51:31.808 --> 03:51:33.484
LAURA: I pop Trinket out.

03:51:33.484 --> 03:51:38.092
MATT: Okay. Trinket pops out of your necklace.
What are you guys doing?

03:51:38.092 --> 03:51:44.994
LAURA: Can I hear the noise of the ziggurat coming
from either side more?

03:51:44.994 --> 03:51:47.405
MATT: You hear it coming from both sides.

03:51:47.405 --> 03:51:50.656
TRAVIS: Let's split up.

03:51:50.656 --> 03:51:53.223
LAURA: What about wind or anything?

03:51:53.223 --> 03:51:57.496
MATT: There's the general wind in the room, but
it's (whoosh) whipping around you, picking up sand

03:51:57.496 --> 03:51:58.974
and dust from the ground.

03:51:58.974 --> 03:52:03.382
LAURA: Do we see faces on either side?

03:52:03.382 --> 03:52:05.313
MATT: Perception check.

03:52:05.313 --> 03:52:08.731
LIAM: I'll have a look, as well.

03:52:08.731 --> 03:52:12.262
LAURA: 28.

03:52:12.262 --> 03:52:13.272
LIAM: 24.

03:52:13.272 --> 03:52:16.860
MATT: Okay. You do not see any faces immediately
within the two paths that are ahead of you.

03:52:16.860 --> 03:52:22.857
However, as you glance past one of the edges,
within the chamber, you can see the sources of

03:52:22.857 --> 03:52:29.849
some of that flickering firelight. You see two
clay bowls, large clay bowls that are set in the

03:52:29.849 --> 03:52:35.930
ground that have burning materials inside. Wood,
cloth. Who knows what, but they're burning this

03:52:35.930 --> 03:52:42.913
bright orange-red flame. Not a natural yellow
flame. A deep orange-red flame. It's causing this

03:52:42.913 --> 03:52:46.124
glow to emanate around the room, and you see the
flames flickering and moving with the wind that's

03:52:46.124 --> 03:52:47.261
blowing about.

03:52:47.261 --> 03:52:51.303
TRAVIS: Safe to assume this goes to the same room,
yeah? Just two different entrances?

03:52:51.303 --> 03:52:52.687
LAURA: Maybe.

03:52:52.687 --> 03:52:54.027
TRAVIS: So let's flank.

03:52:54.027 --> 03:52:55.449
LAURA: I feel like there's traps.

03:52:55.449 --> 03:52:59.411
MARISHA: I go with Percy, since we have the robes
over top of us.

03:52:59.411 --> 03:53:03.351
MATT: All right. Who's going left and right?

03:53:03.351 --> 03:53:04.502
TRAVIS: I'm going right.

03:53:04.502 --> 03:53:05.933
JON: I'll go left.

03:53:05.933 --> 03:53:07.022
ASHLEY: I'm going right.

03:53:07.022 --> 03:53:08.730
MATT: Left?

03:53:08.730 --> 03:53:10.542
LIAM: I'll roll with Percy and Keyleth.

03:53:10.542 --> 03:53:15.239
MATT: Percy and Keyleth with Vax. Grog on the
right. Who else is on the right?

03:53:15.239 --> 03:53:16.518
LAURA: I'll go right.

03:53:16.518 --> 03:53:21.104
MATT: Vex is right. Pike? Right or left?

03:53:21.104 --> 03:53:22.395
ASHLEY: Yeah, right.

03:53:22.395 --> 03:53:23.874
MATT: Trinket's with you.

03:53:23.874 --> 03:53:26.600
SAM: All my people to the right.

03:53:26.600 --> 03:53:37.067
MATT: All righty. Indeed, what looked like two
different hallways was one entrance to the chamber

03:53:37.067 --> 03:53:41.521
that was divided by a singular column in the
center. You both flank around as it opens up

03:53:41.521 --> 03:53:50.353
inside. You see a 50-foot-tall, 70-foot-wide
natural cavern chamber that rounds out over the

03:53:50.353 --> 03:53:58.024
top, and you see it end on the opposite side.
There are two pillars nearer to your end that both

03:53:58.024 --> 03:54:05.249
hold defaced statues of a woman on each. Defaced
statues of a woman. Partially destroyed and

03:54:05.249 --> 03:54:11.780
collapsed. There are elements of it broken on the
ground. The heads removed. In the center of the

03:54:11.780 --> 03:54:18.192
chamber, you see before you a massive
stone-stepped pyramid, similar to the ziggurat

03:54:18.192 --> 03:54:22.475
you've found. The design is a little different,
and you get the sense that a lot of it is still

03:54:22.475 --> 03:54:28.001
buried and it's just the top that has been
uncovered and repurposed for whatever this may be.

03:54:28.001 --> 03:54:39.059
You do see, there are a number of cloaked figures
scattered across these steps, and some of them are

03:54:39.059 --> 03:54:44.291
out looking in your direction as soon as you come
around the side. They're all wearing the same

03:54:44.291 --> 03:54:47.594
black outfits, the cloaks. Some of them have the
hoods back; some of them have the hoods on.

03:54:47.594 --> 03:54:58.066
Roughly, you have what looks to be six or seven
from what you can view. There are two of them at

03:54:58.066 --> 03:55:04.079
the very top that currently have what looks like
another crate that has been opened, and there

03:55:04.079 --> 03:55:13.972
above them, you can see the black orb, exactly
like the one you have underneath Whitestone, and

03:55:13.972 --> 03:55:18.561
they're in the process of taking objects out and
throwing them up into the sphere, and you watch as

03:55:18.561 --> 03:55:24.372
they flash and vanish into the darkness. You see
one cloaked figure that's currently shouting out

03:55:24.372 --> 03:55:26.038
and giving commands right now.

03:55:26.038 --> 03:55:27.455
LAURA: Do they see us?

03:55:27.455 --> 03:55:33.250
MATT: With all of your stealth? You got a 19,
correct? One of them shouts out,

03:55:33.250 --> 03:55:36.614
"We have visitors!"

03:55:36.614 --> 03:55:43.720
LAURA: Do they only see that side? Do they see us
come around the other side of the pillar? They see

03:55:43.720 --> 03:55:44.934
all of us.

03:55:44.934 --> 03:55:51.424
MATT: As soon as they all glance over, you guys
are out in the open of a hallway. Once they see

03:55:51.424 --> 03:56:00.862
him, they see the spread of you. As this happens,
you watch as a number of skeletons walk out from

03:56:00.862 --> 03:56:06.943
the halls on the sides, and one seems to suddenly
shake and rise up from the ground: a large

03:56:06.943 --> 03:56:11.203
skeleton with what looks like giant horns that
curve out of the head, standing about 12 feet

03:56:11.203 --> 03:56:16.148
tall. Looks to be some sort of minotaur-like
beast, but bone and anger.

03:56:16.148 --> 03:56:20.002
LAURA: How far away is the ziggurat?

03:56:20.002 --> 03:56:23.222
MATT: The ziggurat from you guys? Let's pull out a
map.

03:56:23.222 --> 03:56:29.031
(cheering)

03:56:29.031 --> 03:56:30.181
ASHLEY: Do you need help?

03:56:30.181 --> 03:56:33.672
MATT: I may be able to get this here.

03:56:33.672 --> 03:56:35.313
LAURA: It's such a big map.

03:56:35.313 --> 03:56:40.438
MATT: It's a big one. Actually, Travis, do you
want to help me with this real fast?

03:56:40.438 --> 03:56:42.174
JON: This time, it's big.

03:56:42.174 --> 03:56:45.014
MATT: We're working out the kinks here, guys.
Thank you very much.

03:56:45.014 --> 03:56:49.931
SAM: Guys. So many great things available in the
store tonight. Those posters?

03:56:49.931 --> 03:56:54.606
The Scanlan thing. Oh shit.

03:56:54.606 --> 03:56:57.455
LIAM: Combat. Here we go! This is the real deal.

03:56:57.455 --> 03:56:59.133
LAURA: Wait, we didn't do this last time, did we?

03:56:59.133 --> 03:57:01.300
JON: If I hadn't sneezed, you guys, we never would
have seen this.

03:57:01.300 --> 03:57:07.761
TALIESIN: They would all be dead right now. We
would have taken them all out in one clean kill.

03:57:07.761 --> 03:57:10.950
JON: We would have quietly (blow gun sounds).

03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:14.889
SAM: An overhead cam? An out-of-focus overhead
cam?

03:57:14.889 --> 03:57:19.935
JON: This is the place, guys.

03:57:19.935 --> 03:57:21.818
LAURA: Wait, so it's reversed?

03:57:21.818 --> 03:57:25.934
SAM: Matt only has to manage 22 individual
characters right now.

03:57:25.934 --> 03:57:27.933
MATT: No, it's great, guys. I love it; it's
wonderful.

03:57:27.933 --> 03:57:32.184
LAURA: So when we tell you which direction we want
to go, Matt, it's from your perspective.

03:57:32.184 --> 03:57:35.546
MATT: Well, do the best you can to see.

03:57:35.546 --> 03:57:37.782
TRAVIS: The map's right.

03:57:37.782 --> 03:57:41.823
TALIESIN: Towards and away from the ziggurat, and
the ziggurat's 12:00 and we're 6:00.

03:57:41.823 --> 03:57:45.274
SAM: We'll just say leeward and windward.
Starboard.

03:57:45.274 --> 03:57:54.490
MATT: Okay, so. There is a singular figure
standing up here that seems to be giving orders

03:57:54.490 --> 03:57:59.620
and shouting it out to the side. Female voice
rings out across the center of the chamber and

03:57:59.620 --> 03:58:05.776
says, "Remnants, slay the intruders and grant
their bodies to the cause!"

03:58:05.776 --> 03:58:08.316
LAURA: Can I see whose voice that was?

03:58:08.316 --> 03:58:10.638
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:58:10.638 --> 03:58:16.511
LAURA: That was crazy. 27.

03:58:16.511 --> 03:58:23.094
MATT: 27. It's hard to see. She's in the dark
right there and the sphere doesn't give a lot of

03:58:23.094 --> 03:58:25.454
light, but the voice sounds familiar.

03:58:25.454 --> 03:58:29.471
SAM and LAURA: Familiar?

03:58:29.471 --> 03:58:37.531
MATT: All right, so at this point the woman pulls
an amulet. The woman pulls an amulet out from

03:58:37.531 --> 03:58:46.345
beneath the robe, and as she clutches it in her
hand, the orb shifts from black to white, to a

03:58:46.345 --> 03:58:53.749
white-gray color, and you watch as the wind
(whoosh) gets whipped up even heavier and lights

03:58:53.749 --> 03:59:02.083
up the area around the space. You watch as the
cloaked hood flows back, and for a brief moment,

03:59:02.083 --> 03:59:07.991
before the grin crawls across her face, you see
the face of

03:59:07.991 --> 03:59:09.515
Delilah Briarwood.

03:59:09.515 --> 03:59:10.624
(gasps)

03:59:10.624 --> 03:59:12.329
SAM: We killed her! She's dead!

03:59:12.329 --> 03:59:13.781
LAURA: No!

03:59:13.781 --> 03:59:15.424
TRAVIS: Look at Percy.

03:59:15.424 --> 03:59:17.366
SAM: She's dead. She died. We killed her!

03:59:17.366 --> 03:59:18.945
ASHLEY: Oh no.

03:59:18.945 --> 03:59:20.770
MATT: Yet there she is at the top of the
ziggurat.

03:59:20.770 --> 03:59:21.879
LAURA: How?!

03:59:21.879 --> 03:59:23.498
SAM: This is like a soap opera!

03:59:23.498 --> 03:59:25.589
LAURA: Dun dun dun!

03:59:25.589 --> 03:59:28.053
TRAVIS: I broke the world for you returns!

03:59:28.053 --> 03:59:30.095
MATT: I would like you all to roll initiative.

03:59:30.095 --> 03:59:33.657
TRAVIS: (laughs) What?

03:59:33.657 --> 03:59:35.862
LAURA: I know.

03:59:35.862 --> 03:59:39.267
ASHLEY: This looks like a crazy fight.

03:59:39.267 --> 03:59:43.167
MARISHA: Natural 20.

03:59:43.167 --> 03:59:44.497
MATT: Nice.

03:59:44.497 --> 03:59:49.655
MARISHA: If only it was for something a little
more important, but it's fine.

03:59:49.655 --> 03:59:51.397
TALIESIN: You get to go first.

03:59:51.397 --> 03:59:54.248
MATT: So 25 to 20?

03:59:54.248 --> 03:59:55.891
TALIESIN: 20.

03:59:55.891 --> 03:59:58.096
SAM: 20 for Scanlan.

03:59:58.096 --> 03:59:59.316
MATT: What was it?

03:59:59.316 --> 04:00:00.595
MARISHA: 22, tied with Scanlan.

04:00:00.595 --> 04:00:02.803
SAM: No, mine's just 20.

04:00:02.803 --> 04:00:04.374
MATT: All right, so Percy.

04:00:04.374 --> 04:00:06.034
TALIESIN: Percy and Scanlan are tied.

04:00:06.034 --> 04:00:09.805
MATT: Scanlan. Okay. All right.

04:00:09.805 --> 04:00:16.192
SAM: Wait, does Doty roll? I forget. No, he just
goes when Taryon does.

04:00:16.192 --> 04:00:19.641
MATT: Yeah, I'm letting him go with Taryon. It's
easier to check that. All right, 20 to 15?

04:00:19.641 --> 04:00:21.115
TRAVIS: 17.

04:00:21.115 --> 04:00:22.706
SAM: Taryon's 16.

04:00:22.706 --> 04:00:23.668
LIAM: 15.

04:00:23.668 --> 04:00:30.032
MATT: All right, so we have Grog. You got, what
did you say? 17? Vax, what did you say?

04:00:30.032 --> 04:00:31.247
TRAVIS: 15.

04:00:31.247 --> 04:00:32.941
MATT: Oh, 15 and you said 17 for Taryon?

04:00:32.941 --> 04:00:34.507
SAM: 16 for Taryon.

04:00:34.507 --> 04:00:35.640
MATT: All right.

04:00:35.640 --> 04:00:38.981
LAURA: 14.

04:00:38.981 --> 04:00:40.183
MATT: 14.

04:00:40.183 --> 04:00:41.683
SAM: What did you get?

04:00:41.683 --> 04:00:43.017
JON: 17.

04:00:43.017 --> 04:00:44.155
SAM: He got 17. Did he tell you?

04:00:44.155 --> 04:00:47.444
MATT: Oh, he didn't tell me that. Sorry about
that.

04:00:47.444 --> 04:00:55.138
ASHLEY: Okay. So many things on the board. I
wonder if those statues

04:00:55.138 --> 04:00:56.668
are going to come to life.

04:00:56.668 --> 04:01:04.875
MATT: All righty. So who else is left. Pike?

04:01:04.875 --> 04:01:10.505
ASHLEY: Seven! She's so good at initiative
rolling.

04:01:10.505 --> 04:01:16.838
MATT: All right, so at the beginning of this
initiation, with the orb now flaring this pale

04:01:16.838 --> 04:01:23.361
gray-white and Delilah Briarwood standing there at
the top of the ziggurat, staring down and focusing

04:01:23.361 --> 04:01:26.111
on the group of intruders that have just rushed
in. Keyleth, it's your turn.

04:01:26.111 --> 04:01:37.223
MARISHA: Oh god. Okay. I am going to, under the
cult hood that I have, transform my face with

04:01:37.223 --> 04:01:39.846
Alter Self into Sylas Briarwood.

04:01:39.846 --> 04:01:42.234
MATT: Okay.

04:01:42.234 --> 04:01:50.570
MARISHA: Her husband. Her dead husband. I'm going
to have his face, and I'm going to walk forward

04:01:50.570 --> 04:01:58.091
and say, Delilah. Don't. It is me.

04:01:58.091 --> 04:02:03.044
MATT: Make a deception check.

04:02:03.044 --> 04:02:06.485
MARISHA: Deception?

04:02:06.485 --> 04:02:09.192
MATT: So as you step forward into the chamber.

04:02:09.192 --> 04:02:13.644
MARISHA: This is not good.

04:02:13.644 --> 04:02:16.394
LIAM: Sunshine, roll high.

04:02:16.394 --> 04:02:30.650
MARISHA: I'm not good at this shit. Oh, that's not
bad! 14? That's it. 14. That's all I got. 14 is

04:02:30.650 --> 04:02:32.001
good for me.

04:02:32.001 --> 04:02:33.276
TALIESIN: It's dark.

04:02:33.276 --> 04:02:39.123
MATT: Okay, so that's your action. As you say this
to Delilah, her eyes flash over to you,

04:02:39.123 --> 04:02:43.986
and her face goes--

04:02:43.986 --> 04:02:45.531
SAM: She's mad.

04:02:45.531 --> 04:02:47.004
LAURA: So pissed!

04:02:47.004 --> 04:02:49.616
MATT: You have your movement and your bonus,
still.

04:02:49.616 --> 04:02:54.118
MARISHA: Movement and a bonus? (sighs)

04:02:54.118 --> 04:02:57.197
LIAM: Feeblemind on the dragon.

04:02:57.197 --> 04:03:10.303
MARISHA: I am going to take my bonus to ignite my
form into a fire elemental and rush towards the

04:03:10.303 --> 04:03:12.008
closest thing to me.

04:03:12.008 --> 04:03:13.901
MATT: Okay, there are two skeletons to your
right and left.

04:03:13.901 --> 04:03:15.645
You're turning into a fire elemental.

04:03:15.645 --> 04:03:22.761
MARISHA: Yeah. I don't know. Where are we?

04:03:22.761 --> 04:03:26.730
MATT: There you go, Keyleth.

04:03:26.730 --> 04:03:32.968
MARISHA: Okay, I have a 50-foot movement. I want
to hit as many skeletons as I can by running

04:03:32.968 --> 04:03:35.276
through them and catching them on fire.

04:03:35.276 --> 04:03:46.200
MATT: Okay, so with that, you can do (counting).
You can probably get this whole cluster here. All

04:03:46.200 --> 04:03:53.097
righty. They all catch fire as you rush through.
You do get attacks of opportunity on you as you

04:03:53.097 --> 04:03:58.091
rush by. That is 15?

04:03:58.091 --> 04:04:05.763
MARISHA: What am I against?

04:04:05.763 --> 04:04:09.263
MATT: What's your AC for your fire elemental?

04:04:09.263 --> 04:04:10.441
MARISHA: Hit.

04:04:10.441 --> 04:04:14.050
MATT: All right, so that's 11 points of slashing
damage, reduced to half because you take half

04:04:14.050 --> 04:04:15.189
damage, right?

04:04:15.189 --> 04:04:17.622
MARISHA: Yep. So five.

04:04:17.622 --> 04:04:20.773
MATT: That's a 13?

04:04:20.773 --> 04:04:25.013
MARISHA: Miss. No, hit. Armor class is 13.

04:04:25.013 --> 04:04:30.033
MATT: Another five points of slashing damage.
Ten?

04:04:30.033 --> 04:04:32.963
MARISHA: Miss.

04:04:32.963 --> 04:04:34.945
MATT: Eight.

04:04:34.945 --> 04:04:36.505
MARISHA: Miss.

04:04:36.505 --> 04:04:52.026
MATT: Okay. That one and that one. That is a 15
from the minotaur skeleton.

04:04:52.026 --> 04:04:53.390
MARISHA: Hit.

04:04:53.390 --> 04:04:59.588
MATT: You take 17 points of slashing damage,
reduced to eight. And the last one is a natural

04:04:59.588 --> 04:05:07.834
20, so you take 22 points of slashing damage,
reduced to 11. And they are all set aflame. All of

04:05:07.834 --> 04:05:10.662
them take, I believe, fire damage from impacting
you?

04:05:10.662 --> 04:05:12.251
MARISHA: Yep.

04:05:12.251 --> 04:05:19.519
MATT: So we'll say eight damage across the board
for all of them. All of them get hit with fire as

04:05:19.519 --> 04:05:24.297
they swipe out at you, including the giant
minotaur that swings over you with this large

04:05:24.297 --> 04:05:29.756
greataxe in its hands and bursts into flames as it
does so. Awesome. All right, that ends your turn,

04:05:29.756 --> 04:05:37.370
Keyleth. Delilah, who's currently glaring at
Keyleth and the rest of you, looks out and goes,

04:05:37.370 --> 04:05:48.186
"Of course it would be you, wouldn't it?" She
takes a step back. Without breaking eye contact,

04:05:48.186 --> 04:05:56.309
goes, "Finish your work." (foreign words) And
slams her hand down on the ground, and you watch

04:05:56.309 --> 04:06:08.127
as this sphere of rainbow color completely
encompasses around the top of the ziggurat. You

04:06:08.127 --> 04:06:15.302
now see this large orb, this dome of multicolored
rainbows that flickers for a second, and then

04:06:15.302 --> 04:06:18.649
briefly becomes a singular color.

04:06:18.649 --> 04:06:21.077
LAURA: It's a giant--

04:06:21.077 --> 04:06:30.497
MATT: You see it is a giant Prismatic Sphere
around. The color you see now as it flickers for a

04:06:30.497 --> 04:06:34.556
minute becomes stark red, just deep ruby red.

04:06:34.556 --> 04:06:38.014
JON: It's so pretty. Look at it, you guys.

04:06:38.014 --> 04:06:40.237
LIAM: Taste the rainbow.

04:06:40.237 --> 04:06:42.338
TRAVIS: These people kill ducks, Lionel.

04:06:42.338 --> 04:06:44.148
JON: (gasps) Kill them all!

04:06:44.148 --> 04:06:46.983
MATT: Percival, Scanlan. What are you guys doing?

04:06:46.983 --> 04:06:52.726
TALIESIN: Scanlan, you first. My plan just went up
the rainbow.

04:06:52.726 --> 04:07:00.885
SAM: All right. I'll step forward and I will-- is
Vax or Vex near me? Vex is near me, right?

04:07:00.885 --> 04:07:02.062
MATT: Vex is near you, yeah.

04:07:02.062 --> 04:07:10.419
SAM: I will inspire Vex. I will sing to her. I
will sing, (singing) you don't need anybody else.

04:07:10.419 --> 04:07:15.148
When I stand beside you, I touch you, elf. Whoa.

04:07:15.148 --> 04:07:17.976
(laughter)

04:07:17.976 --> 04:07:20.404
SAM: Something creepy.

04:07:20.404 --> 04:07:21.889
LAURA: Working your way back up.

04:07:21.889 --> 04:07:33.064
SAM: And then I'll cast Reverse Gravity on
everybody. Everybody in there. All their shit.

04:07:33.064 --> 04:07:43.735
MATT: All righty! What's the radius on that? My
templates are still back on the shelf. Can someone

04:07:43.735 --> 04:07:45.477
grab my templates real fast? That would be
awesome.

04:07:45.477 --> 04:07:46.643
SAM: 50 feet.

04:07:46.643 --> 04:07:47.736
MATT: 50-foot radius?

04:07:47.736 --> 04:07:48.692
SAM: 50 feet radius.

04:07:48.692 --> 04:07:52.734
MATT: Oh, that's going to get everybody in there,
including probably Keyleth.

04:07:52.734 --> 04:07:55.563
MARISHA: I can take it. I'm into this.

04:07:55.563 --> 04:07:56.863
MATT: You can fly, though, right?

04:07:56.863 --> 04:07:59.451
MARISHA: I can fire hover?

04:07:59.451 --> 04:08:02.850
TALIESIN: I have sticky feet right now, so I ain't
going nowhere.

04:08:02.850 --> 04:08:08.419
MATT: Reverse Gravity, perfect. Dexterity save
across the board.

04:08:08.419 --> 04:08:10.296
What's the spell DC with the hand cone?

04:08:10.296 --> 04:08:11.653
SAM: 22.

04:08:11.653 --> 04:08:13.395
TALIESIN: Fuck their shit up!

04:08:13.395 --> 04:08:16.408
SAM: Does it affect people in the dome?

04:08:16.408 --> 04:08:18.045
MATT: You don't know.

04:08:18.045 --> 04:08:19.795
TALIESIN: We'll hear a thunk, won't we?

04:08:19.795 --> 04:08:29.203
MATT: You see over here, a number of other robed
figures and one that looks like it's

04:08:29.203 --> 04:08:36.487
heavily armored in the front, as well. A couple of
small other cultists down on the sides, but they

04:08:36.487 --> 04:08:44.956
all-- apparently. Okay, the armored one actually
manages to grab the stonework and hold on.

04:08:44.956 --> 04:08:51.899
SAM: Oh boy, Matt's hating this.

04:08:51.899 --> 04:08:59.480
MATT: Everyone else, except for that one armored
guard, rises up and (wham) slams into the ceiling

04:08:59.480 --> 04:09:08.257
50 feet up. That is 5d10 points of damage. 5d6,
sorry. Thank you very much. Perfect.

04:09:08.257 --> 04:09:10.433
MARISHA: Is that including me, or no?

04:09:10.433 --> 04:09:11.876
MATT: That would be including you.

04:09:11.876 --> 04:09:12.925
MARISHA: Okay.

04:09:12.925 --> 04:09:16.676
LIAM: Let me just reiterate, we always appreciated
Scanlan.

04:09:16.676 --> 04:09:20.054
SAM: I just need to hear it more, guys.

04:09:20.054 --> 04:09:29.184
MATT: 20 points of bludgeoning damage, which
completely destroys these skeletons that were

04:09:29.184 --> 04:09:31.062
damaged earlier from the fire.

04:09:31.062 --> 04:09:32.765
LIAM: So long, pawns.

04:09:32.765 --> 04:09:37.379
MATT: All right. Are you maintaining it, or
letting them fall?

04:09:37.379 --> 04:09:39.004
SAM: Maintain!

04:09:39.004 --> 04:09:45.148
MATT: All righty, so everyone else is held in the
air right now against the ceiling.

04:09:45.148 --> 04:09:47.451
SAM: The people inside the dome? No.

04:09:47.451 --> 04:09:48.844
MATT: Seem to be unaffected.

04:09:48.844 --> 04:09:50.344
SAM: Oh, that ziggurat.

04:09:50.344 --> 04:09:51.843
LAURA: Anti-magic dome.

04:09:51.843 --> 04:09:56.806
SAM: I'll move a little closer in.

04:09:56.806 --> 04:10:00.194
MATT: So over here next to Pike?

04:10:00.194 --> 04:10:02.775
SAM: Done. Percival.

04:10:02.775 --> 04:10:05.927
MATT: That ends Scanlan's turn. Percy, what are
you doing?

04:10:05.927 --> 04:10:11.928
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull out Bad News.
Actually, let's pull out Animus. This will be

04:10:11.928 --> 04:10:16.226
funnier if I'm walking around that way, which is
always a fun thing to say. There's that one guy

04:10:16.226 --> 04:10:17.644
holding on, right?

04:10:17.644 --> 04:10:19.591
MATT: There's one guy holding on, yeah.

04:10:19.591 --> 04:10:22.519
TALIESIN: There's one guy holding on. I'm going to
use my gun to make him drop an object of my

04:10:22.519 --> 04:10:31.131
choosing. And that object is going to be the
pyramid. So just remembering how to do this.

04:10:31.131 --> 04:10:34.090
MATT: Roll for an attack.

04:10:34.090 --> 04:10:39.155
TALIESIN: Roll for an attack. That's 29?

04:10:39.155 --> 04:10:41.814
MATT: That will hit. All right, he has to make a
strength saving throw?

04:10:41.814 --> 04:10:43.726
TALIESIN: Strength saving throw against 20.

04:10:43.726 --> 04:10:50.503
MATT: Nope, five plus five. That is a no, so he
goes (whoosh) and slams into the ceiling, as well,

04:10:50.503 --> 04:10:56.932
taking-- ooh, that is 22 points of bludgeoning
damage.

04:10:56.932 --> 04:11:00.515
MARISHA: Can Keyleth clothesline him on the way up
as a fire elemental?

04:11:00.515 --> 04:11:10.263
MATT: Sure. Close enough. You swoosh over there;
it's fine. More of a flavor element. So all the

04:11:10.263 --> 04:11:13.842
visible creatures you can see right now are held
against the ceiling.

04:11:13.842 --> 04:11:19.426
TALIESIN: Okay, is he still alive? I don't suppose
I have advantage to hit anything that's pinned to

04:11:19.426 --> 04:11:21.347
the ceiling.

04:11:21.347 --> 04:11:25.823
MATT: I'm going to say for the purposes of falling
up, a lot of them are prone, so you would actually

04:11:25.823 --> 04:11:27.331
have disadvantage.

04:11:27.331 --> 04:11:43.983
TALIESIN: So weird. I'll take it. I hit the wrong
thing. There we are. I'll burn another point for

04:11:43.983 --> 04:11:56.854
advantage and shoot him again. Just with a
straight roll. That's 19.

04:11:56.854 --> 04:12:02.715
MATT: That hits. Same armored guy?

04:12:02.715 --> 04:12:12.775
TALIESIN: Same guy. That's nine points of damage,
plus three points of psychic damage.

04:12:12.775 --> 04:12:19.675
MATT: Okay. All right?

04:12:19.675 --> 04:12:28.790
TALIESIN: And I'll hit him again. Same thing. Hit
him again. This time I'm going to take a bonus for

04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:35.983
a Hex on him, too, for extra fun. That's 27.

04:12:35.983 --> 04:12:37.906
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

04:12:37.906 --> 04:12:48.219
TALIESIN: So that's not bad. That's 17 points of
damage, plus three points of psychic damage and

04:12:48.219 --> 04:12:50.059
five points of necrotic damage.

04:12:50.059 --> 04:12:55.696
MATT: Nice! You're just firing up at this figure.
The one shot sends it flying up into the ceiling,

04:12:55.696 --> 04:13:00.962
and I'd say even before it impacts, as it's still
floating up in the air, you shoot it once while

04:13:00.962 --> 04:13:05.340
it's still falling upward, and then it slams into
the ceiling and you get one final shot to hit it

04:13:05.340 --> 04:13:10.145
while it's there. (grunts) Across the top. It's
hard to see if it's really that hurt, but it's

04:13:10.145 --> 04:13:13.287
currently a little wounded.

04:13:13.287 --> 04:13:18.773
TALIESIN: Yeah, and he's got disadvantage on
dexterity checks for now, because that's funny.

04:13:18.773 --> 04:13:21.671
MATT: Are you going to move, Percival, or are you
going to stay where you are?

04:13:21.671 --> 04:13:25.422
TALIESIN: I'm slowly going to make my way towards
the ziggurat, so I'm going to be actually walking

04:13:25.422 --> 04:13:31.470
up on the wall. So you can put me up on the little
creases. Yeah, I'm walking sideways, as gravity's

04:13:31.470 --> 04:13:37.668
reversed right now. I'll make my way, as far as I
can get, towards the sphere.

04:13:37.668 --> 04:13:42.829
MATT: Okay, and that radius, by the way, is
maintained as long as you concentrate on that. So

04:13:42.829 --> 04:13:49.185
anybody who walks into that radius will have to
make a dex save or be flung up into that. So! That

04:13:49.185 --> 04:13:55.285
being the case, ending Scanlan's turn and Percy's
turn, the cultists that are currently flung to the

04:13:55.285 --> 04:14:01.494
ceiling are going to get up and run this way, so
they're technically up on the ceiling right now.

04:14:01.494 --> 04:14:12.121
Those two are going to continue their work. You
don't see what's in there. Grog, you're up.

04:14:12.121 --> 04:14:14.491
TRAVIS: Is it me and Chad?

04:14:14.491 --> 04:14:23.476
MATT: Let's see here. Actually, no. I disagree.
They actually can take an action this turn from

04:14:23.476 --> 04:14:31.995
that distance. So I need Grog and Pike to both
make wisdom saving throws.

04:14:31.995 --> 04:14:36.327
LAURA: Are you both wise?

04:14:36.327 --> 04:14:42.100
ASHLEY: I have gnome cunning, so I have advantage
on wisdom.

04:14:42.100 --> 04:14:43.565
TRAVIS: 14.

04:14:43.565 --> 04:14:45.101
MATT: 14.

04:14:45.101 --> 04:14:47.528
ASHLEY: What did you say it was, wisdom? 20?

04:14:47.528 --> 04:14:49.915
LAURA: Roll your advantage. You get advantage.

04:14:49.915 --> 04:14:51.555
ASHLEY: Maybe I don't need it?

04:14:51.555 --> 04:14:53.974
LAURA: Try it. Maybe you'll roll a natural 20.

04:14:53.974 --> 04:14:56.359
MATT: Advantage for which one?

04:14:56.359 --> 04:15:02.711
ASHLEY: I have gnome cunning. I have advantage on
wisdom, intelligence, charisma saving throws.

04:15:02.711 --> 04:15:04.810
MATT: Just in general?

04:15:04.810 --> 04:15:06.758
ASHLEY: I guess so.

04:15:06.758 --> 04:15:18.248
MATT: Against magic, I think it was? So yeah, both
of you guys shrug off the effect. You feel the

04:15:18.248 --> 04:15:24.934
magic try to take hold over the inside of your
brain and your muscles seize up and you manage to

04:15:24.934 --> 04:15:31.163
shrug it off. It's a familiar feeling. It is one
that you're familiar with, as well, Pike. It is a

04:15:31.163 --> 04:15:33.144
Hold Person attempt on both of you.

04:15:33.144 --> 04:15:35.978
ASHLEY: I know what you did. I know what you were
trying to do!

04:15:35.978 --> 04:15:40.781
MATT: All right, that ends their turn. Grog,
you're up.

04:15:40.781 --> 04:15:44.191
TRAVIS: Okay, where does that sphere of vertical
influence start?

04:15:44.191 --> 04:15:45.678
MATT: You're not entirely certain, Grog.

04:15:45.678 --> 04:15:51.463
TRAVIS: Awesome. I'm going to go into a rage and
haul ass along this wall.

04:15:51.463 --> 04:15:56.278
MATT: Okay, as you rush into this wall here, I
need you to make a dexterity saving throw.

04:15:56.278 --> 04:16:02.840
TRAVIS: I have advantage on those. 14.

04:16:02.840 --> 04:16:09.373
MATT: Grog, you start running and then (yelps) go
flying up into the ceiling.

04:16:09.373 --> 04:16:12.966
SAM: Oh shit, it affects the area?

04:16:12.966 --> 04:16:17.935
TRAVIS: (screams)

04:16:17.935 --> 04:16:21.229
MATT: You take 17 points of bludgeoning.

04:16:21.229 --> 04:16:23.547
TRAVIS: I raged at the beginning.

04:16:23.547 --> 04:16:30.050
MATT: So half that. You're now locked on the
ceiling, as well. However, that does put you in

04:16:30.050 --> 04:16:34.349
melee range, and prone, with one of the cultists
on the ceiling.

04:16:34.349 --> 04:16:37.085
TRAVIS: Totally meant to do that. I'll attack.

04:16:37.085 --> 04:16:40.602
MATT: You're upside-down on the ceiling. The guy
who cast a spell and it didn't work on you watched

04:16:40.602 --> 04:16:43.373
you tumble up, land, get up, and stare him down in
his face.

04:16:43.373 --> 04:16:44.519
TRAVIS: Hi.

04:16:44.519 --> 04:16:49.164
MATT: His hood falls off. You see a guy who's
staring at you now with

04:16:49.164 --> 04:16:51.138
one eye plucked out of its socket.

04:16:51.138 --> 04:16:56.719
TRAVIS: Might as well make a matching one.
Reckless! Natural 20.

04:16:56.719 --> 04:16:58.514
(cheering)

04:16:58.514 --> 04:17:00.070
MATT: Roll some damage.

04:17:00.070 --> 04:17:21.189
TRAVIS: So I rolled a ten. Two more of these,
seven. 31, 11, 42.

04:17:21.189 --> 04:17:33.613
MATT: Okay. You smile at him, bring the axe back,
and you completely-- we're talking tree trunk. He

04:17:33.613 --> 04:17:38.632
slides over and his body attaches to the ceiling
and collapses against that, blood splattering out

04:17:38.632 --> 04:17:46.064
from his midsection. It seems really gross, in a
sense. You still have at half movement, about 20

04:17:46.064 --> 04:17:47.927
feet to run across.

04:17:47.927 --> 04:17:50.164
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll keep trying to come to this wall.

04:17:50.164 --> 04:17:58.203
MATT: This wall? Okay. That's about as far as you
get, but you don't have range with your axe.

04:17:58.282 --> 04:17:59.724
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

04:17:59.724 --> 04:18:05.689
MATT: Okay. Finishes Grog's turn. Lionel. You're
over here, currently.

04:18:05.689 --> 04:18:15.416
JON: I move forward and I jump into the radius so
I can float up, too. And as I'm flying, I say,

04:18:15.416 --> 04:18:17.036
I'll save you, Grog!

04:18:17.036 --> 04:18:21.321
TRAVIS: Come on, buddy!

04:18:21.321 --> 04:18:28.062
MATT: Do you go into a rage first? It will reduce
your impact damage as you land.

04:18:28.062 --> 04:18:31.236
JON: Wait, what?

04:18:31.236 --> 04:18:32.704
TALIESIN: You take less damage.

04:18:32.704 --> 04:18:34.531
MATT: If you want to be raging first, you'll take
less damage from the impact.

04:18:34.531 --> 04:18:36.129
JON: Yeah, you know what? Let's rage.

04:18:36.129 --> 04:18:39.593
MATT: Okay. You joyfully leap into the sky.

04:18:39.593 --> 04:18:40.995
JON: It's the duck rage.

04:18:40.995 --> 04:18:46.130
MATT: You take 16, reduced to half, so you take
eight points of bludgeoning damage as you slam

04:18:46.130 --> 04:18:52.109
into the ground at the top, and you stand up and
there's about five feet between you and Grog, and

04:18:52.109 --> 04:18:55.575
one of the cultists is there right in front of
you, who's like, "Shit!"

04:18:55.575 --> 04:18:58.690
JON: I rage.

04:18:58.690 --> 04:19:03.477
MATT: Do you want to attack him? Go for it.

04:19:03.477 --> 04:19:14.137
JON: I think the anti-gravity is screwing me up.
Three, plus 12.

04:19:14.137 --> 04:19:16.915
MATT: Three plus 12 still hits, actually.

04:19:16.915 --> 04:19:19.130
JON: He does it clumsily.

04:19:19.130 --> 04:19:23.115
MATT: Your first strike is 2d6 plus ten damage.

04:19:23.115 --> 04:19:31.791
JON: Seven. 17.

04:19:31.791 --> 04:19:36.272
MATT: 17 points of slashing damage as you pull
your greataxe up and rake past. You see his chest

04:19:36.272 --> 04:19:42.386
split open and he (grunts) pulls back. He's still
alive, and as he looks up at you from under the hood, he is

04:19:42.386 --> 04:19:44.907
also missing one of his eyes. (pants)

04:19:44.907 --> 04:19:50.071
JON: Second attack? Rage, bonus action...

04:19:50.071 --> 04:19:55.433
MATT: You have an extra attack as a barbarian, so
you get a second attack.

04:19:55.433 --> 04:19:56.794
JON: Okay.

04:19:56.794 --> 04:19:58.495
TALIESIN: d20.

04:19:58.495 --> 04:20:00.500
JON: Do the same thing.

04:20:00.500 --> 04:20:05.684
TALIESIN: Natural 20! Now roll 4d6.

04:20:05.684 --> 04:20:06.855
MATT: Roll 4d6.

04:20:06.855 --> 04:20:07.901
TRAVIS: Stop touching him!

04:20:07.901 --> 04:20:15.688
TALIESIN: He's so plush, though. It's really nice.
Whoa! Does he get to reroll ones?

04:20:15.688 --> 04:20:17.995
SAM: Oh, that's a one.

04:20:17.995 --> 04:20:19.460
TALIESIN: Does he get to reroll a one?

04:20:19.460 --> 04:20:22.601
MATT: He does, because of his great weapon
fighting, yeah.

04:20:22.601 --> 04:20:24.207
TALIESIN: Reroll it. Better.

04:20:24.207 --> 04:20:30.549
JON: So it's 17. Plus ten. 27.

04:20:30.549 --> 04:20:36.467
MATT: Okay. The first strike cuts him across the
chest. (pants) Rears back. Oh, that wasn't enough,

04:20:36.467 --> 04:20:46.785
and with a second half-assed swipe, he goes down
and spills out all across the ceiling. That

04:20:46.785 --> 04:20:53.447
cultist is done. All righty, that finishes your
turn. Taryon.

04:20:53.447 --> 04:21:00.200
SAM: Doty, stay here. I'll jump on the broom. I
cast Fly on-- no, I don't have to cast Fly.

04:21:00.200 --> 04:21:01.253
I'm on a broom!

04:21:01.253 --> 04:21:04.879
LAURA: It's hard to keep track of three
characters.

04:21:04.879 --> 04:21:08.129
SAM: Well, Matt does it all the time.

04:21:08.129 --> 04:21:14.450
TALIESIN: The walls are tall enough that you can
put that above people and it won't be a problem.

04:21:14.450 --> 04:21:17.161
MATT: Possibly. We'll find out. Where are you
going, Tary?

04:21:17.161 --> 04:21:20.944
SAM: I'm going to fly straight in to the steps.

04:21:20.944 --> 04:21:24.610
MATT: All right, so you're doing a dash? Or just
your movement?

04:21:24.610 --> 04:21:27.994
SAM: Can I get there in one fly?

04:21:27.994 --> 04:21:29.583
MATT: What's the speed of the broom?

04:21:29.583 --> 04:21:31.049
SAM: It's 40, right?

04:21:31.049 --> 04:21:33.820
MATT: You can get there. That's as close as you
can get with one movement.

04:21:33.820 --> 04:21:37.084
TALIESIN: You're close, though. You can throw
something at it.

04:21:37.084 --> 04:21:51.507
SAM: I can't get all the way there, so I'll cast
something. Shit. It's a prismatic thing, right?

04:21:51.507 --> 04:21:58.936
MATT: Right now you have this ruby, bright-red
dome that's glowing with light right now.

04:21:58.936 --> 04:22:04.410
SAM: Would a Prismatic Spray beat a Prismatic
Spray? Probably not, right?

04:22:04.410 --> 04:22:06.380
MATT: I don't know. What do you think?

04:22:06.380 --> 04:22:11.595
SAM: Shit. I'm not going to risk it. I'm going to
point straight up.

04:22:11.595 --> 04:22:15.543
Is there anyone right above me?

04:22:15.543 --> 04:22:19.950
MATT: Yes, actually. These guys here are 
on the ceiling right now. Anything you see there

04:22:19.950 --> 04:22:22.549
are on the ceiling, currently.

04:22:22.549 --> 04:22:33.232
SAM: And I'm up a bit, so I could throw something
at them? I guess drop it. I'll drop a thing

04:22:33.232 --> 04:22:39.277
of fire up there. Alchemic fire. A little pot.

04:22:39.277 --> 04:22:40.897
MATT: At which one?

04:22:40.897 --> 04:22:44.717
SAM: Can I get two of them? It has a five-foot
radius.

04:22:44.717 --> 04:22:46.412
MATT: Yes, you can hit these two.

04:22:46.412 --> 04:22:47.903
SAM: Great. I'll go for both of them.

04:22:47.903 --> 04:22:55.979
MATT: All right, so the skeleton and guy get to make...
what's the DC?

04:22:55.979 --> 04:22:57.309
SAM: 17.

04:22:57.309 --> 04:23:03.754
MATT: 17? Unfortunately, the cultist makes it.
Skeleton does not. So the cultist dodges out of

04:23:03.754 --> 04:23:08.171
the way on the ceiling. It smashes on the ground
by the skeleton and bursts into flames. How much

04:23:08.171 --> 04:23:09.920
damage does it deal to the skeleton?

04:23:09.920 --> 04:23:12.776
SAM: I'm 15th level or 16th level?

04:23:12.831 --> 04:23:13.723
MATT: 15th.

04:23:13.723 --> 04:23:15.240
SAM: Okay. 5d6.

04:23:15.240 --> 04:23:17.076
MATT: 5d6 fire damage to the skeleton.

04:23:17.076 --> 04:23:23.201
SAM: 16.

04:23:23.201 --> 04:23:28.643
MATT: 16 points of fire damage? That skeleton,
fire consumes it. It's still currently standing,

04:23:28.643 --> 04:23:31.902
and now the flames are licking through its
ribcage. That ends your turn?

04:23:31.902 --> 04:23:39.038
SAM: I will, as a bonus action, cast Sanctuary. Am
I within 30 feet of any of my friends?

04:23:39.038 --> 04:23:43.373
MATT: Right now? Nope.

04:23:43.373 --> 04:23:44.737
SAM: On myself.

04:23:44.737 --> 04:23:46.755
MATT: All righty. Vax, you're up.

04:23:46.755 --> 04:23:57.149
LIAM: Boots on, poof go the wings. I have two
actions left. It's really hard to see. How far am

04:23:57.149 --> 04:23:59.594
I from skeletal minotaur?

04:23:59.594 --> 04:24:03.059
MATT: Right there? You're approximately 40 feet.
45.

04:24:03.059 --> 04:24:10.256
LIAM: And nowhere on the board are any of my
allies within melee combat range of any enemy.

04:24:10.256 --> 04:24:12.868
MATT: Nope! Anyone that was killed whatever they
were fighting.

04:24:12.868 --> 04:24:19.430
LIAM: That's what I figured. Okay, so I'm going to
use my two remaining actions to throw daggers at

04:24:19.430 --> 04:24:21.294
minotaur skeleton.

04:24:21.294 --> 04:24:25.099
MATT: From where you are? From where you're
standing?

04:24:25.099 --> 04:24:27.994
LIAM: I'm 40 feet away. I'm in range.

04:24:27.994 --> 04:24:29.979
MATT: Yeah, and you have sharpshooter.

04:24:29.979 --> 04:24:32.320
LIAM: I didn't say it on the first.

04:24:32.320 --> 04:24:35.872
MATT: You have sharpshooter, right? Sharpshooter feat.

04:24:35.872 --> 04:24:38.765
LIAM: I have it if I choose it, but I don't want
to choose it.

04:24:38.765 --> 04:24:41.210
MATT: Right, I'm asking because that ignores
cover.

04:24:41.210 --> 04:24:44.501
LIAM: I have sharpshooter. Right, so I ignore
three-quarters cover. So the first one is a 19?

04:24:44.501 --> 04:24:45.531
MATT: Hits.

04:24:45.531 --> 04:24:55.377
LIAM: Good, and the second one-- oh, that hits,
for sure. That's a 16... 28. Okay, so for the

04:24:55.377 --> 04:25:02.467
first one, I'm going to unload some Smite into
this motherfucker because I know he's undead. That

04:25:02.467 --> 04:25:13.959
is three, plus eight is 11, plus psychic damage is
17, plus 3d8 because he's undead. So 17 plus eight

04:25:13.959 --> 04:25:20.820
is 25, 29, 36 for the first attack.

04:25:20.820 --> 04:25:26.868
MATT: 36 damage. As you fling the dagger out, it
seems to skid across the stone of the pillar in

04:25:26.868 --> 04:25:30.987
front of it, leaving these bright white sparks as
it hits. Comes through and strikes through the

04:25:30.987 --> 04:25:35.299
chest. As it does, a burst of divine energy. You
watch as some of the ribs shatter and scatter

04:25:35.299 --> 04:25:40.312
across the stonework. (roars)

04:25:40.312 --> 04:25:49.919
LIAM: Fucking feathers, buddy. And then the second
one is four, plus the Smite, and I get four plus

04:25:49.919 --> 04:25:54.937
eight is 12, 15, 22.

04:25:54.937 --> 04:25:56.482
MATT: 22.

04:25:56.482 --> 04:25:59.151
LIAM: Wait, I can only smite once per round?

04:25:59.151 --> 04:26:05.624
MATT: You can smite. I believe so. I think it's
whenever you expend a spell slot, so I don't think

04:26:05.624 --> 04:26:10.103
there's a limitation per round. That's part of
what makes paladins so crazy at the higher levels,

04:26:10.103 --> 04:26:16.943
actually. But just to make sure of that or the
internet's going to hate me. No, there's no

04:26:16.943 --> 04:26:19.436
limitation on that. So 22?

04:26:19.436 --> 04:26:27.114
LIAM: I'm also going to use my movement. Is there
enough room to fly safely over big skeleton?

04:26:27.114 --> 04:26:33.007
MATT: Yeah, it's about 12 feet tall, so as long as
you get 20 feet over it, you can.

04:26:33.007 --> 04:26:40.872
LIAM: Then I want to get into the back corner
closest to Liam, on the map.

04:26:40.872 --> 04:26:42.315
MATT: Over here?

04:26:42.315 --> 04:26:44.182
LIAM: Yeah. 120 feet of movement.

04:26:44.182 --> 04:26:45.820
MATT: Over here, you mean.

04:26:45.820 --> 04:26:46.863
LIAM: Yeah.

04:26:46.863 --> 04:26:50.821
MATT: All right, you're over here in this area.

04:26:50.821 --> 04:26:55.623
LIAM: As far back from the enemies as I can be.
That's good. Done.

04:26:55.623 --> 04:26:58.222
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Vex.

04:26:58.222 --> 04:27:01.605
LAURA: Has anybody tried shooting anything through
the orb?

04:27:01.684 --> 04:27:02.948
MATT: Not yet, no.

04:27:02.948 --> 04:27:08.150
LAURA: Okay. Well, I'm going to try Hunter's
Marking Delilah.

04:27:08.150 --> 04:27:09.887
MATT: You have no sight on her.

04:27:09.887 --> 04:27:11.188
LAURA: I don't?

04:27:11.188 --> 04:27:18.666
MATT: No. All you see is a sphere of red. It
blocks everything. All sight is obscured with

04:27:18.666 --> 04:27:23.322
light. It's very bright; the whole room is lit up.
You almost have to squint a little,

04:27:23.322 --> 04:27:24.846
looking at it.

04:27:24.846 --> 04:27:29.218
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to try to shoot an arrow,
then, at where I remember her being.

04:27:29.218 --> 04:27:31.536
MATT: Okay, go for it. Roll an attack.

04:27:31.536 --> 04:27:37.464
LAURA: Because it's red. Natural 20!

04:27:37.464 --> 04:27:40.690
MATT: Awesome. The arrow shatters. No effect.

04:27:40.690 --> 04:27:50.824
LAURA: Oh, what a waste. Because it was red.
Motherfuck. Okay, then I'm going to Hunter's Mark

04:27:50.824 --> 04:27:59.650
that big guy and I'm going to shoot him with a
flaming bowstring.

04:27:59.650 --> 04:28:03.019
LIAM: Y'all motherfuckers need Sarenrae.

04:28:03.019 --> 04:28:05.511
LAURA: Are you fucking kidding me?

04:28:05.511 --> 04:28:08.168
LIAM: Well, you got a 20 on the last one.

04:28:08.168 --> 04:28:10.055
LAURA: Yeah, when it didn't fucking count!

04:28:10.055 --> 04:28:15.091
LIAM: Well, we've all got to eat a little humble
pie every once in a while. Even you.

04:28:15.091 --> 04:28:19.401
LAURA: You motherfuck. Don't rub it in my face
when I just rolled a one.

04:28:19.401 --> 04:28:22.339
MATT: Anything you want to do with Trinket?
Movement?

04:28:22.339 --> 04:28:29.439
LAURA: No, he has to wait because he's going to
get hit. He's going to get bludgeoned.

04:28:29.439 --> 04:28:34.052
MATT: Okay, ends Vex's turn. Skeletons are now
going to go.

04:28:34.052 --> 04:28:37.527
LAURA: I am going to move back into the little
corner that's next to me.

04:28:37.527 --> 04:28:38.978
MATT: Right here.

04:28:38.978 --> 04:28:41.229
LAURA: Yeah, and Trinket will follow me in there.

04:28:41.229 --> 04:28:50.827
MATT: Perfect. The skeletons get up and start
rushing in towards the nearest things. This one's

04:28:50.827 --> 04:28:54.369
going to rush towards Grog. This one's going to
rush towards Keyleth there. This one's also going

04:28:54.369 --> 04:29:00.872
to rush towards Keyleth. The minotaur, who got
impacted angrily, sees you dart past. Turns

04:29:00.872 --> 04:29:11.044
around. You're not within range, so it's going to
move up towards (heavy footsteps). This knight is

04:29:11.044 --> 04:29:16.801
also going to move in towards Keyleth. These guys
up at the top are going to focus in that

04:29:16.801 --> 04:29:25.950
way. All right, first, the minotaur swings with
its axe. Makes a giant swing towards you, Lionel.

04:29:25.950 --> 04:29:35.648
Actually, no. What it's going to do is it's going
to rush up, instead, put its head down, and charge

04:29:35.648 --> 04:29:48.172
forward towards you with its horns in front. It's
attempting to strike you with its horns. That's 18 to

04:29:48.172 --> 04:29:50.737
hit. What's your armor class?

04:29:50.737 --> 04:29:52.202
JON: It is 18.

04:29:52.202 --> 04:30:02.572
MATT: 18, okay, so that just barely hits. You
suffer 13 plus nine. You take 21 points of

04:30:02.572 --> 04:30:07.564
piercing damage, reduced to half, so it's ten,
because you're raging. I need you to make a

04:30:07.564 --> 04:30:09.528
strength saving throw.

04:30:09.528 --> 04:30:16.945
JON: So mine's plus ten. That's with this dice,
right?

04:30:16.945 --> 04:30:20.747
MATT: Yes. Roll that, plus ten.

04:30:20.747 --> 04:30:22.946
JON: 23.

04:30:22.946 --> 04:30:27.671
MATT: 23, yeah. You're not pushed. You get the
impact and the horns come to your chest and you're

04:30:27.671 --> 04:30:31.903
like, "ooh, that hurt," but this giant creature's
stopped in its tracks. Its hooves are scraping

04:30:31.903 --> 04:30:39.430
into the ground, and you're immovable. That's the
end of its turn. Skeleton attacks on Keyleth.

04:30:39.430 --> 04:30:42.346
That's 18?

04:30:42.346 --> 04:30:43.689
MARISHA: Hits.

04:30:43.689 --> 04:30:44.970
MATT: 13?

04:30:44.970 --> 04:30:47.754
MARISHA: Hits. 13 is my armor class.

04:30:47.754 --> 04:30:53.528
MATT: All right, you take 22 points of slashing
damage, reduced to 11, from the two attacks.

04:30:53.528 --> 04:30:56.742
MARISHA: 11, so I'm at 52.

04:30:56.742 --> 04:31:01.689
MATT: And all right.

04:31:01.689 --> 04:31:07.446
TALIESIN: Dungeons and Dragons. Yeah.

04:31:07.446 --> 04:31:14.895
MATT: The blackguard is going to make three
attacks with this giant glaive that it has. Now

04:31:14.895 --> 04:31:20.405
you've got up close, you can see this jagged black
armor. He's going to rush up with his glaive and

04:31:20.405 --> 04:31:45.180
spins. All three attacks on you. That is 23? 18?
And 16. All righty, so you take nine, plus

04:31:45.180 --> 04:31:56.164
Thunderous Smite damage. That's going to be 21
points of damage. Sorry, it's going to be nine

04:31:56.164 --> 04:32:01.363
points of slashing, which is reduced to four, and
then you take an additional

04:32:01.363 --> 04:32:05.893
15 points of thunder damage.

04:32:05.893 --> 04:32:08.121
MARISHA: So 19 points total?

04:32:08.121 --> 04:32:09.953
MATT: Correct. Mark that off.

04:32:09.953 --> 04:32:14.886
TALIESIN: No, it's the big motherfucker. The
minotaur.

04:32:14.886 --> 04:32:17.351
LIAM: Wait, smite?

04:32:17.351 --> 04:32:27.675
MATT: The second strike is going to hit you again.
He's going to burn another slot for another smite.

04:32:27.675 --> 04:32:38.548
On the second one, you take another four points of
slashing damage, plus 13 points of radiant damage

04:32:38.548 --> 04:32:41.996
to you. This would be necrotic damage.

04:32:41.996 --> 04:32:43.994
TRAVIS: From the skeleton minotaur?

04:32:43.994 --> 04:32:45.583
MATT: No, this is from the armored guy.

04:32:45.583 --> 04:32:50.779
TRAVIS: Gotcha. Okay. We've got to get you out of
there.

04:32:50.779 --> 04:33:00.110
MATT: And the third strike hits you for four
points of slashing and a third dark smite. Another

04:33:00.110 --> 04:33:01.941
13 points of necrotic damage.

04:33:01.941 --> 04:33:05.354
MARISHA: That brings me exactly to zero.

04:33:05.354 --> 04:33:07.398
MATT: You drop your form.

04:33:07.398 --> 04:33:16.233
MARISHA: I drop form. Just form. I tanked that
motherfucking fight, y'all.

04:33:16.233 --> 04:33:21.316
MATT: So at that point, all of a sudden your form
drops in place.

04:33:21.316 --> 04:33:24.309
MARISHA: I'm still on the ceiling, right?

04:33:24.309 --> 04:33:35.412
MATT: Yes, you are. The war priest across the way
is going to look outward and begin to focus and

04:33:35.412 --> 04:33:40.544
chant under his breath, and the little bit of
light begins to show, once again, the missing eye

04:33:40.544 --> 04:33:44.950
on most of these individuals. Delilah is not
missing an eye, it seems, but the rest of them

04:33:44.950 --> 04:33:50.742
seem to have this appearance amongst them. As it
releases this form of energy, you watch as a

04:33:50.742 --> 04:33:58.359
familiar, darker-burning flame begins to spill
across the ceiling as a Flame Strike makes its

04:33:58.359 --> 04:34:04.527
way-- not a Fire Storm, Flame Strike. Sorry, so
it's a column.

04:34:04.527 --> 04:34:08.773
SAM: Am I close to him?

04:34:08.773 --> 04:34:14.128
MATT: Scanlan is-- it's a 60-foot range, is what
you're asking? Yes, it is.

04:34:14.128 --> 04:34:15.862
SAM: I'll Counterspell that.

04:34:15.862 --> 04:34:17.120
MATT: Counterspell the Flame Strike?

04:34:17.120 --> 04:34:18.479
SAM: Sure.

04:34:18.479 --> 04:34:20.627
MARISHA: Scanlan!

04:34:20.627 --> 04:34:22.931
LIAM: I missed you.

04:34:22.931 --> 04:34:25.203
TALIESIN: It's so nice that this is not a problem.

04:34:25.203 --> 04:34:28.514
MATT: I need you to roll a d20. Add your charisma
modifier.

04:34:28.514 --> 04:34:41.681
SAM: It's just a plus two? Oh, wait. Wrong guy!
Ooh, 19.

04:34:41.681 --> 04:34:49.997
MATT: 19 will do it. With that, as the flames
begin to well out in this column of fire and dark

04:34:49.997 --> 04:34:58.227
divine energy, you just reach out and snap your
fingers and the spell vanishes on the spot.

04:34:58.227 --> 04:35:00.045
LIAM: Shorthalt.

04:35:00.045 --> 04:35:01.277
ASHLEY: Shorthalt.

04:35:01.277 --> 04:35:02.667
LAURA: Shorthalt!

04:35:02.667 --> 04:35:09.621
SAM: I don't feel the love! I need to go away for
another year.

04:35:09.621 --> 04:35:11.910
TRAVIS: It's a start.

04:35:11.910 --> 04:35:23.490
MATT: That necromancer, however, is going to
impact in the center of the chamber a burst of

04:35:23.490 --> 04:35:27.112
necrotic energy that billows out from the center
in a 60-foot radius.

04:35:27.112 --> 04:35:29.296
It's going to affect all of you guys.

04:35:29.296 --> 04:35:34.731
LIAM: Me up in the corner?

04:35:34.731 --> 04:35:39.224
MATT: Everyone but you because you're away. Mr.
Way Out of the Way Guy.

04:35:39.224 --> 04:35:41.130
LIAM: It's what I do.

04:35:41.130 --> 04:35:42.551
MARISHA: Ceiling and floor?

04:35:42.551 --> 04:35:48.227
MATT: Ceiling and floor, because it's a large
enough radius where it affects the entire space. I

04:35:48.227 --> 04:35:50.922
need you guys to roll a constitution saving throw
for me, please.

04:35:50.922 --> 04:35:52.084
LAURA: Who?

04:35:52.084 --> 04:35:58.006
MATT: Everybody but Vax. No, it will still affect
Doty.

04:35:58.006 --> 04:36:01.406
TALIESIN: I have advantage because of Cabal.

04:36:01.406 --> 04:36:06.052
LAURA: I suck tonight!

04:36:06.052 --> 04:36:08.014
MARISHA: Yeah!

04:36:08.014 --> 04:36:10.798
LAURA: I can't help it!

04:36:10.798 --> 04:36:20.943
LIAM: Mother bitch!

04:36:20.943 --> 04:36:23.241
SAM: Laura, did you roll?

04:36:23.241 --> 04:36:30.203
LAURA: Oh, I can add inspiration! Okay. No,
that's not going to save me.

04:36:30.203 --> 04:36:32.842
MATT: So over here. Grog?

04:36:32.842 --> 04:36:34.030
TRAVIS: 26.

04:36:34.030 --> 04:36:38.413
MATT: 26. You take 15 points of necrotic damage.
Pike.

04:36:38.413 --> 04:36:39.771
ASHLEY: 15.

04:36:39.771 --> 04:36:42.196
MATT: 15? You take 15 points of necrotic damage.

04:36:42.196 --> 04:36:43.504
LAURA: Ten.

04:36:43.504 --> 04:36:45.520
MATT: You take 30 points of necrotic damage.

04:36:45.520 --> 04:36:47.254
MARISHA: 23.

04:36:47.254 --> 04:36:48.998
MATT: You take 15 points of necrotic damage.

04:36:48.998 --> 04:36:50.035
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

04:36:50.035 --> 04:36:51.637
MATT: 15 points of necrotic damage.

04:36:51.637 --> 04:36:52.526
JON: Ten.

04:36:52.526 --> 04:36:55.308
MATT: 30 points of necrotic damage. Scanlan?

04:36:55.308 --> 04:36:57.483
SAM: 24.

04:36:57.483 --> 04:37:01.200
MATT: 24? You take 15 points of necrotic damage,
and make a concentration check, please.

04:37:01.200 --> 04:37:04.905
Constitution saving throw, with advantage because
you have war caster.

04:37:04.905 --> 04:37:06.086
SAM: Plus anything?

04:37:06.086 --> 04:37:08.479
MATT: Plus your constitution saving throw bonus.

04:37:08.479 --> 04:37:13.451
SAM: Constitution saving throw. It's a lot. 22 on
the first one.

04:37:13.451 --> 04:37:16.595
MATT: You have advantage, but yeah. You maintain
concentration. You're fine.

04:37:16.595 --> 04:37:19.881
All righty, and I need Taryon.

04:37:19.881 --> 04:37:23.057
SAM: 13 plus seven. 20.

04:37:23.057 --> 04:37:29.765
MATT: All right. 15 points of necrotic damage to
Taryon. As the wave fades off, you hear the

04:37:29.765 --> 04:37:37.326
chuckle of the two cultists, and they step
backward into the red sphere.

04:37:37.326 --> 04:37:39.222
TALIESIN: Weren't they on the ceiling?

04:37:39.222 --> 04:37:45.050
MATT: Oh, you're right. Sorry. They were on the
ceiling. Thank you for the reminder!

04:37:45.050 --> 04:37:47.638
TALIESIN: They were my least favorite.

04:37:47.638 --> 04:37:49.084
MATT: I know. Fair enough.

04:37:49.084 --> 04:37:51.553
SAM: Does Doty get hit?

04:37:51.553 --> 04:37:52.849
MATT: Doty does get hit, yes.

04:37:52.849 --> 04:37:53.753
SAM: He's out.

04:37:53.753 --> 04:37:58.527
MATT: Doty is (creak, impact) on the ground. Thank
you for the reminder. Sorry.

04:37:58.527 --> 04:38:00.200
SAM: Wait, how many points?

04:38:00.200 --> 04:38:01.932
MATT: 30. 30 necrotic.

04:38:01.932 --> 04:38:03.208
LAURA: Trinket.

04:38:03.208 --> 04:38:06.706
MATT: Did Trinket roll? Roll for Trinket.

04:38:06.706 --> 04:38:08.203
LAURA: No.

04:38:08.203 --> 04:38:20.944
MATT: 30 points of necrotic for Trinket. All
righty. That ends their go there. Pike?

04:38:20.944 --> 04:38:31.095
ASHLEY: Okay, so I am going to hold my turn until
after Scanlan goes.

04:38:31.095 --> 04:38:36.446
MATT: All you can hold is an action. What action
are you going to hold?

04:38:36.446 --> 04:38:38.654
ASHLEY: I have to tell you what I'm going to do?

04:38:38.654 --> 04:38:43.357
MATT: Essentially, yeah. As opposed to moving your
initiative around in the order, you can still move

04:38:43.357 --> 04:38:47.066
on your turn, and then if you're going to cast or
attack, you start it and then wait for something

04:38:47.066 --> 04:38:49.076
to trigger it and then release it when that
happens.

04:38:49.076 --> 04:38:58.133
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt, but I'm
going to hold it until after Scanlan's turn.

04:38:58.133 --> 04:39:00.825
LIAM: He's at the bottom?

04:39:00.825 --> 04:39:02.817
LAURA: She's at the bottom.

04:39:02.817 --> 04:39:08.192
MATT: Scanlan's close to the top. Okay, so you
begin casting Guiding Bolt. What's the trigger?

04:39:08.192 --> 04:39:09.431
For Scanlan to go?

04:39:09.431 --> 04:39:10.543
ASHLEY: For Scanlan to go.

04:39:10.543 --> 04:39:13.594
MATT: Okay. You begin concentrating on the spell.
End of your turn?

04:39:13.594 --> 04:39:15.960
ASHLEY: Yes.

04:39:15.960 --> 04:39:17.450
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

04:39:17.450 --> 04:39:21.542
MARISHA: Okay. How many people are still on the
ceiling with me?

04:39:21.542 --> 04:39:35.916
MATT: Grog, Lionel, and a number of skeletons. The
blackguard, the two other casters over there, the

04:39:35.916 --> 04:39:37.225
minotaur skeleton...

04:39:37.225 --> 04:39:44.829
MARISHA: Okay. I drop form. I'm going to look
around and go, (nervous laughter) and drop my

04:39:44.829 --> 04:39:54.667
staff and do Fire Storm radiating out from me, and
I want to try and avoid Lionel and Grog, but

04:39:54.667 --> 04:39:58.271
basically radiating out, fire floods the ceiling.

04:39:58.271 --> 04:40:15.361
MATT: Okay. You can hit him. (counting) You can
get everyone but these two skeletons, if you want

04:40:15.361 --> 04:40:16.978
to do a swath through that.

04:40:16.978 --> 04:40:18.822
MARISHA: Everyone but the two skeletons?

04:40:18.822 --> 04:40:33.777
MATT: Actually, if you started it here, you could
go... (counting) You can either avoid the two

04:40:33.777 --> 04:40:36.413
skeletons or avoid one of those casters. Your
call.

04:40:36.413 --> 04:40:37.921
MARISHA: No, fuck the casters.

04:40:37.921 --> 04:40:41.884
MATT: So those two skeletons next to you:
untouched. Everything else in there has to make a

04:40:41.884 --> 04:40:47.502
dexterity saving throw against a DC 21. Natural 20
on that first skeleton.

04:40:47.502 --> 04:40:49.108
MARISHA: What a dick!

04:40:49.108 --> 04:41:01.174
MATT: Minotaur does not make it. Let's see.
Blackguard does not make it. Natural 20 on that

04:41:01.174 --> 04:41:09.331
caster there, and a 13 on that one. So this one
fails, that caster succeeds, blackguard fails,

04:41:09.396 --> 04:41:13.417
minotaur fails, skeleton succeeds. Roll damage on
that.

04:41:13.417 --> 04:41:37.481
MARISHA: I get to reroll ones. (counting) 26. Roll
two more. 12 more damage. What did I just say?

04:41:37.481 --> 04:41:38.925
TALIESIN: 26.

04:41:38.925 --> 04:41:43.643
MARISHA: 26, plus 12 more. 38 damage.

04:41:43.643 --> 04:41:56.101
MATT: 38 points of damage. This skeleton is burned
into ash and destroyed. The minotaur skeleton, even though

04:41:56.101 --> 04:42:00.518
it made the save with a 20, it had taken damage
from the fall earlier and it was enough to wipe it

04:42:00.518 --> 04:42:14.844
out. Minotaur skeleton, with that last bit, also
burns up. The flames burn around the blackguard,

04:42:14.844 --> 04:42:20.891
but it stands there, defiant. It seems to almost
be relishing the pain as it burns and tears

04:42:20.891 --> 04:42:27.624
through its armor. You don't see a face. All you
see is black armor, jagged at the tips, long cloak

04:42:27.624 --> 04:42:31.199
that is burned to the back, big glaive that spins
in his arm.

04:42:31.199 --> 04:42:32.520
TRAVIS: Where is he?

04:42:32.520 --> 04:42:36.094
MATT: Right there. He takes half the damage.

04:42:36.094 --> 04:42:40.117
TALIESIN: Is he on fire, too?

04:42:40.117 --> 04:42:48.725
MATT: It doesn't set them on fire. All righty.
Keyleth, that's your action. What else are you

04:42:48.725 --> 04:42:49.740
going to do?

04:42:49.740 --> 04:42:53.599
MARISHA: Can I move any? Can I back out of
wherever I am? Where am I?

04:42:53.599 --> 04:42:56.639
MATT: You're right there. Two skeletons get
attacks of opportunity on you if you move.

04:42:56.639 --> 04:42:59.622
It's up to you.

04:42:59.622 --> 04:43:06.828
MARISHA: I'll stay. Let me back out of it.

04:43:06.828 --> 04:43:12.216
MATT: Okay. Two attacks of opportunity on you.
That is a 24?

04:43:12.216 --> 04:43:13.432
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:43:13.432 --> 04:43:15.510
MATT: And a 17.

04:43:15.510 --> 04:43:16.980
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:43:16.980 --> 04:43:19.519
MATT: All right. You take 22 points of slashing
damage.

04:43:19.519 --> 04:43:21.020
LIAM: Sorry, honey.

04:43:21.020 --> 04:43:22.421
MARISHA: It's okay.

04:43:22.421 --> 04:43:27.366
LIAM: You're fine. Oh, you're dead.

04:43:27.366 --> 04:43:28.680
MARISHA: I'm fine.

04:43:28.680 --> 04:43:42.967
MATT: Okay. Delilah.

04:43:42.967 --> 04:43:46.874
SAM: Wait, she goes through the thing?!

04:43:46.874 --> 04:43:48.828
MATT: Yeah. She walks through.

04:43:48.828 --> 04:43:50.512
LIAM: She can go wherever the fuck she wants.

04:43:50.512 --> 04:44:04.843
MATT: She's going to make a dexterity check to
hold on right there, and she rolls a 23. No, a 22.

04:44:04.843 --> 04:44:16.137
Your DC is 22 for Scanlan? She just steps out of
it and holds onto the edge. Actually, she wouldn't

04:44:16.137 --> 04:44:21.096
have had to do that. She steps to the edge. She
succeeded, but she basically just looks out of the

04:44:21.096 --> 04:44:26.335
sphere. You watch her face appear out, and her hand.
She begins to look around for her next target.

04:44:26.335 --> 04:44:30.487
LIAM: Matt Mercer in drag, shitting all over us.

04:44:30.487 --> 04:44:34.304
SAM: All it ever has been.

04:44:34.304 --> 04:44:47.241
MATT: She looks over at you, Pike, and goes, "Not
this time, my dear." I need you-- Delilah's got the

04:44:47.241 --> 04:44:53.828
Player's Handbook-- I need you to make an
intelligence saving throw, please.

04:44:53.828 --> 04:44:59.822
ASHLEY: Intelligence saving throw? Okay, I get
advantages. Okay.

04:44:59.822 --> 04:45:04.368
LAURA: Don't jinx this.

04:45:04.368 --> 04:45:08.805
TRAVIS: The same fucking thing.

04:45:08.805 --> 04:45:10.677
LIAM: Two eights. Holy fuck.

04:45:10.677 --> 04:45:11.931
ASHLEY: Nine.

04:45:11.931 --> 04:45:26.660
MATT: Nine. As her finger reaches out to you, your
brain goes a little numb and a little fuzzy, and

04:45:26.660 --> 04:45:35.602
the spell that you were preparing dissipates, and
conscious thought becomes difficult as the

04:45:35.602 --> 04:45:37.268
Feeblemind spell takes effect.

04:45:37.268 --> 04:45:39.129
MARISHA: No! Bitch!

04:45:39.129 --> 04:45:42.030
LAURA: What works on Feeblemind?

04:45:42.030 --> 04:45:43.530
MARISHA: This is my karma!

04:45:43.530 --> 04:45:49.148
MATT: Your intelligence and charisma become one.
You can't cast spells, you cannot understand

04:45:49.148 --> 04:45:51.427
language or communicate in any intelligible way.

04:45:51.427 --> 04:45:55.249
MARISHA: I might be able to do a Greater
Restoration on you, but I don't know

04:45:55.249 --> 04:45:58.261
if I can help you there.

04:45:58.261 --> 04:46:02.187
LAURA: Tiberius had it one time. How did we heal
him?

04:46:02.187 --> 04:46:03.960
MARISHA: It was a restoration spell.

04:46:03.960 --> 04:46:08.462
MATT: She steps, laughing, back into the orb.

04:46:08.462 --> 04:46:12.621
LIAM: Back into the Skittle? Fuck you, Delilah.
Holy shit!

04:46:12.621 --> 04:46:14.914
MATT: Percy, you're up.

04:46:14.914 --> 04:46:18.011
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it.

04:46:18.011 --> 04:46:21.821
TRAVIS: Can you point to where Pike is on the map?
Okay.

04:46:21.821 --> 04:46:29.267
TALIESIN: I'm going to continue further down the
wall towards the evil orb of death.

04:46:29.267 --> 04:46:30.548
MATT: Okay.

04:46:30.548 --> 04:46:36.242
TALIESIN: Is that as far as I can get?

04:46:36.242 --> 04:46:38.554
MATT: That's as far as you can get in a 30-foot
movement, yeah.

04:46:38.554 --> 04:46:42.640
TALIESIN: Okay. And the cultist closest to me on
the ceiling?

04:46:42.640 --> 04:46:46.457
MATT: That's going to be that one right there.

04:46:46.457 --> 04:46:52.130
TALIESIN: That one right there? Let's do some
damage with Animus, and let's add a sharpshooter

04:46:52.130 --> 04:46:53.583
for it, just for fun.

04:46:53.583 --> 04:46:54.978
MATT: Okay.

04:46:54.978 --> 04:46:56.961
TALIESIN: That's 16 to hit.

04:46:56.961 --> 04:47:00.268
MATT: 16 to hit does not hit.

04:47:00.268 --> 04:47:03.978
TALIESIN: Hold on, I may have done that wrong. 17
to hit.

04:47:03.978 --> 04:47:10.917
MATT: Still does not hit. As soon as you fire, it
hits but it sparks off what looks like big plate

04:47:10.917 --> 04:47:15.753
armor on this caster that the robes were
obscuring. As it hits, it tears through the cloth

04:47:15.753 --> 04:47:18.014
and you see the reflection of armor beneath.

04:47:18.014 --> 04:47:28.222
TALIESIN: That's irritating. All right, forget
sharpshooter. One more. That's better. 24 to hit.

04:47:28.222 --> 04:47:29.854
MATT: 24 hits, yeah.

04:47:29.854 --> 04:47:40.735
TALIESIN: This is not the one I have the Hex on,
right? Okay, that's fine. I should have done that

04:47:40.735 --> 04:47:44.080
differently. 12 points of damage and one point of
psychic damage.

04:47:44.080 --> 04:47:50.342
MATT: All righty. This does hit. (gunshot) Doesn't
seem to affect him much.

04:47:50.342 --> 04:47:54.973
TALIESIN: He's still fine, isn't he? That's fine.
I'm going to hit him again.

04:47:54.973 --> 04:47:57.837
MATT: Go for it. Scanlan, you're up next.

04:47:57.837 --> 04:48:09.871
TALIESIN: That's like 35 to hit. Jesus Christ, I
rolled a 19. And that's 17 points of damage and

04:48:09.871 --> 04:48:11.796
one point of psychic damage.

04:48:11.796 --> 04:48:20.047
MATT: All righty. Still standing. Not showing any
wear and tear. Taking damage, but does not appear

04:48:20.047 --> 04:48:22.776
to be wounded significantly.

04:48:22.776 --> 04:48:40.137
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus to heal myself
a little bit because goddamn it. Oh, Jesus.

04:48:40.137 --> 04:48:44.056
JON: You're attacking who?

04:48:44.056 --> 04:48:47.939
TALIESIN: I'm attacking one of the cultists. I'm
up to 120 hit points now.

04:48:47.939 --> 04:48:51.228
MATT: This isn't the one in the fully dark armor.
This is the one that has armor under a cloak. It

04:48:51.228 --> 04:48:57.295
looks like an older man's face. Has this staff at
the side and a mace hanging from the belt and is

04:48:57.295 --> 04:49:00.222
currently casting spells from the ceiling right
now.

04:49:00.222 --> 04:49:04.322
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. I wanted to throw some
electricity on it and I blanked because my brain

04:49:04.322 --> 04:49:06.568
is made of Swiss cheese. Is it too late?

04:49:06.568 --> 04:49:07.707
MATT: I'll let you throw it on.

04:49:07.707 --> 04:49:16.843
TALIESIN: I'm going to add-- on that last shot,
I'm going to add 5d6 worth of electricity damage.

04:49:16.843 --> 04:49:18.475
MATT: Go for it.

04:49:18.475 --> 04:49:25.386
TALIESIN: (counting) 16 points of lightning
damage.

04:49:25.386 --> 04:49:27.555
MATT: 16 points of lightning damage.

04:49:27.555 --> 04:49:37.063
TALIESIN: That's five Cabal's. (blast) Five
Cabal's.

04:49:37.063 --> 04:49:41.197
MATT: All righty. That ends your turn, Percival?

04:49:41.197 --> 04:49:42.776
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:49:42.776 --> 04:49:44.400
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

04:49:44.400 --> 04:49:46.322
SAM: I don't have much.

04:49:46.322 --> 04:49:48.245
TALIESIN: Really?

04:49:48.245 --> 04:49:51.677
MARISHA: You've always ever said that.

04:49:51.677 --> 04:49:53.768
TALIESIN: You always say that. That doesn't mean
anything.

04:49:53.768 --> 04:49:57.333
TRAVIS: The minotaur's down, right?

04:49:57.333 --> 04:50:00.068
MATT: The minotaur fell, yeah. It was incinerated
by the Fire Storm.

04:50:00.068 --> 04:50:01.923
LAURA: It's cultists and Delilah left?

04:50:01.923 --> 04:50:03.413
MATT: And some skeletons.

04:50:03.413 --> 04:50:05.179
TRAVIS: And a dark paladin's still up there.

04:50:05.179 --> 04:50:06.956
MARISHA: The blackguard, yeah.

04:50:06.956 --> 04:50:10.963
JON: The one who's got all that black. The really
powerful one.

04:50:10.963 --> 04:50:12.133
LAURA: Okay.

04:50:12.133 --> 04:50:13.786
TALIESIN: It's possible we can run straight into
the ball.

04:50:13.786 --> 04:50:16.521
SAM: Who's with me? Who's near me? Nobody, right?

04:50:16.521 --> 04:50:22.522
MATT: Right now? Nobody is near you. Right, Pike
is right next to you.

04:50:22.522 --> 04:50:37.824
SAM: I can't do anything to Pike or with Pike.
(fake sobs) All right. I'll inspire myself. The

04:50:37.824 --> 04:50:48.517
saddest inspiration. (singing) It's raining
gnomes. Hallelujah, it's raining gnomes.

04:50:48.517 --> 04:51:00.721
Everywhere we go. Short, stout, tough, and mean.
The handsomest I've ever seen.

04:51:00.721 --> 04:51:03.345
MATT: What are you doing?

04:51:03.345 --> 04:51:09.458
SAM: I'm going to Dimension Door into the orb,
into the whatever this thing is.

04:51:09.458 --> 04:51:11.013
The prismatic ball.

04:51:11.013 --> 04:51:12.951
MATT: Okay.

04:51:12.951 --> 04:51:19.093
LAURA: If it's doable to pass through a magic
barrier.

04:51:19.093 --> 04:51:22.006
TALIESIN: It might be concentration-based, and if
he can knock it out...

04:51:22.006 --> 04:51:26.412
ASHLEY: Clever gnome.

04:51:26.412 --> 04:51:29.901
LIAM: Come on, baby.

04:51:29.901 --> 04:51:32.837
MATT: I'm going to check one thing. This is
important,

04:51:32.837 --> 04:51:35.191
because this will make a big difference.

04:51:35.191 --> 04:51:39.699
LAURA: Is it an action to drop anti-gravity?

04:51:39.699 --> 04:51:42.044
SAM: I can do it at will.

04:51:42.044 --> 04:51:44.532
LAURA: They'll all get bludgeoning damage from the
fall.

04:51:44.532 --> 04:51:45.806
SAM: So will you.

04:51:45.806 --> 04:51:47.246
LAURA: I'm not on the ceiling.

04:51:47.246 --> 04:51:48.385
MATT: All right.

04:51:48.385 --> 04:51:56.436
SAM: Not into the orb of death.

04:51:56.436 --> 04:52:09.496
MATT: But inside the sphere. I understand. I will
say, as is the nature of the spell versus a

04:52:09.496 --> 04:52:18.915
Dimension Door, I need you, as you begin to pass
through, your form folds through the magic, the

04:52:18.915 --> 04:52:29.260
very powerful magic and intent of this sphere. The
dome of red hits you immediately. I need you to

04:52:29.260 --> 04:52:34.015
make a dexterity saving throw, please.

04:52:34.015 --> 04:52:37.951
SAM: Two.

04:52:37.951 --> 04:52:39.343
MATT: Two.

04:52:39.343 --> 04:52:45.891
SAM: Oh, wait. Plus six. That's eight. Plus, I'm
inspired.

04:52:45.891 --> 04:52:48.894
MATT: You can inspire and roll on top of that, if
you want.

04:52:48.894 --> 04:52:52.171
SAM: Ten. So 18.

04:52:52.171 --> 04:52:55.983
MATT: 18. Not enough. All right.

04:52:55.983 --> 04:53:02.106
TALIESIN: Oh god, there's a lot of d6 I hear
rolling.

04:53:02.106 --> 04:53:09.113
MATT: You take 28 points of fire damage for the
red. As soon as you flash through, and there's

04:53:09.113 --> 04:53:11.436
orange behind it. I need you to make another
dexterity saving throw.

04:53:11.436 --> 04:53:14.727
LAURA: Oh no, it's a whole rainbow!

04:53:14.727 --> 04:53:16.829
JON: Rainbow, ending with indigo!

04:53:16.829 --> 04:53:21.101
SAM: 18.

04:53:21.101 --> 04:53:22.499
MATT: 18.

04:53:22.499 --> 04:53:24.802
TALIESIN: Oh no.

04:53:24.802 --> 04:53:32.505
LIAM: And if you make it in, you're in a death
box.

04:53:32.505 --> 04:53:43.880
MATT: You take 34 points of force damage. Sorry,
lightning damage on this. Acid damage. I'm reading

04:53:43.880 --> 04:53:45.009
the wrong one.

04:53:45.009 --> 04:53:46.263
SAM: Acid, I get halved.

04:53:46.263 --> 04:53:48.954
MATT: All right, so you take 17 points of acid
damage.

04:53:48.954 --> 04:53:50.161
TALIESIN: Oh god.

04:53:50.161 --> 04:53:56.652
MATT: You pass through that into yellow. Make
another dexterity saving throw.

04:53:56.652 --> 04:54:00.455
SAM: I thought Dimension Door, I disappear to
another plane and reappear.

04:54:00.455 --> 04:54:08.724
MATT: The essence of this 9th-level spell is to
not let anything pass through it.

04:54:08.724 --> 04:54:10.352
SAM: All right. Keep it coming.

04:54:10.352 --> 04:54:12.001
MATT: Make a dexterity saving throw.

04:54:12.001 --> 04:54:14.482
SAM: 16.

04:54:14.482 --> 04:54:16.337
MATT: All right.

04:54:16.337 --> 04:54:25.871
TALIESIN: Can he bounce off at some point and stop
pulling through this fucking rainbow of death?

04:54:25.871 --> 04:54:36.746
MATT: This is the first time that I've used this,
so I'm making sure that I can...

04:54:36.746 --> 04:54:43.541
LIAM: Scanlan Shorthalt, killed by ROYGBIV.

04:54:43.541 --> 04:54:45.906
MARISHA: What fucking spell is this?

04:54:45.906 --> 04:54:51.530
MATT: You know what?

04:54:51.530 --> 04:54:54.008
SAM: No, keep it coming. I got this.

04:54:54.008 --> 04:55:00.443
MATT: No, based on how it's written, it's passing
through the sphere.

04:55:00.443 --> 04:55:02.132
SAM: What do you mean, passing through?

04:55:02.194 --> 04:55:07.857
MATT: Physically passing through the sphere, so I
will say, looking at the rules now and really

04:55:07.857 --> 04:55:10.063
thinking about how it's worded. It doesn't say
otherwise.

04:55:10.063 --> 04:55:13.435
I'll say you can teleport into the sphere.

04:55:13.435 --> 04:55:16.134
LAURA: Oh my god. You're going to another plane!

04:55:16.134 --> 04:55:17.668
TRAVIS: It's not a gimme.

04:55:17.668 --> 04:55:19.419
MATT: I'm going to take that damage back.

04:55:19.419 --> 04:55:23.943
SAM: I can take it, Matt. Bring it!

04:55:23.943 --> 04:55:29.607
MATT: No. You've made a valid point, and the spell
does specify "pass through it." You do not pass

04:55:29.607 --> 04:55:33.447
through it. You appear on the other side. So
what's the range on that?

04:55:33.447 --> 04:55:35.361
SAM: 500 feet.

04:55:35.361 --> 04:55:44.491
MATT: You appear inside. You appear within, and
you're now on the inside. You can see, the bright

04:55:44.491 --> 04:55:53.068
colors are there, blinding you from the interior.
Make a constitution saving throw.

04:55:53.068 --> 04:55:56.355
LIAM: Congratulations. You're in a prison cell
with Charles Manson.

04:55:56.355 --> 04:55:57.670
SAM: 15.

04:55:57.670 --> 04:55:58.694
MATT: 15.

04:55:58.694 --> 04:56:00.320
SAM: I still have my inspiration.

04:56:00.320 --> 04:56:01.521
MATT: You do.

04:56:01.521 --> 04:56:03.631
SAM: 18.

04:56:03.631 --> 04:56:09.135
MATT: Okay. The good news is, you didn't take any
of that damage as you bamf inside the sphere. Bad

04:56:09.135 --> 04:56:10.591
news is, you're blinded for a minute.

04:56:10.591 --> 04:56:11.926
SAM: Great.

04:56:11.926 --> 04:56:19.595
MATT: The colors are so bright in there, your eyes
immediately go stark, flashing white. You cannot

04:56:19.595 --> 04:56:20.887
see anything in there.

04:56:20.887 --> 04:56:22.434
SAM: Great.

04:56:22.434 --> 04:56:25.725
LIAM: Hi, my name's Jeffrey Dahmer. Welcome to my
Prismatic Sphere.

04:56:25.725 --> 04:56:29.558
TALIESIN: You know, I would watch Jeffrey Dahmer's
Prismatic Sphere.

04:56:29.558 --> 04:56:32.197
MATT: Scanlan, that's your action.

04:56:32.197 --> 04:56:34.392
SAM: And my bonus.

04:56:34.392 --> 04:56:35.682
MATT: Is that your turn?

04:56:35.682 --> 04:56:42.821
SAM: Yeah, that's it. That's all I've got. I can't
see the danger I'm in.

04:56:42.821 --> 04:56:46.841
MATT: That's true. However, you didn't take any
damage, so you didn't lose your concentration on

04:56:46.841 --> 04:56:58.810
the spell. You're just blinded. All right, so now
those cultists have all been slain. I forgot to do

04:56:58.810 --> 04:57:02.802
the skeletons last time, so I'll have them move
in. These two skeletons are going to rush in. This

04:57:02.802 --> 04:57:17.708
one's going to go ahead and... 25. That's four
skeletons on you, Keyleth.

04:57:17.708 --> 04:57:20.180
MARISHA: Four skeletons on me?

04:57:20.180 --> 04:57:27.417
MATT: Yeah. Eight misses you. 13 misses you, I'm
pretty sure. Eight again.

04:57:27.417 --> 04:57:28.900
MARISHA: Miss!

04:57:28.900 --> 04:57:34.313
MATT: And a 24. You take 11 points of slashing
damage. Three of them are swinging at you and

04:57:34.313 --> 04:57:36.755
you're dodging out of the way, and then one of
them catches you across the shoulder and you're

04:57:36.755 --> 04:57:41.409
like, (grunts). All right, that ends their go.
Grog.

04:57:41.409 --> 04:57:46.454
TRAVIS: I'm going to charge in towards the
pedestal. What's the first thing that I reach?

04:57:46.454 --> 04:57:50.518
MATT: The first thing that you reach over here is
a skeleton.

04:57:50.518 --> 04:57:53.480
TRAVIS: Yeah. Reckless, great weapon master.

04:57:53.480 --> 04:57:55.003
MATT: Go for it.

04:57:55.003 --> 04:58:01.462
TRAVIS: 27?

04:58:01.462 --> 04:58:08.665
MATT: That hits. Minimum damage, you destroy it,
because of the great weapon master. You walk up,

04:58:08.665 --> 04:58:12.823
smash. There's one also adjacent to you there.

04:58:12.823 --> 04:58:14.258
TRAVIS: Yep. Him, too.

04:58:14.258 --> 04:58:15.690
MATT: Go for it.

04:58:15.690 --> 04:58:23.797
TRAVIS: Reckless again. 20, even.

04:58:23.797 --> 04:58:29.693
MATT: 20 hits. Minimum damage shatters that
skeleton. You can move five feet in and get a

04:58:29.693 --> 04:58:32.089
third one, if you'd like.

04:58:32.089 --> 04:58:37.501
TRAVIS: Actually, I would like to smash the
Titanstone Knuckles

04:58:37.501 --> 04:58:39.281
together and cast Enlarge on myself.

04:58:39.281 --> 04:58:54.199
MATT: Okay. So instead, you go into full,
large-size Grog mode here. (impact sound) There

04:58:54.199 --> 04:58:55.365
you have it.

04:58:55.365 --> 04:58:57.256
TRAVIS: Fee fie foe, you're fucked.

04:58:57.256 --> 04:59:00.620
MATT: That's your turn, Grog? Lionel.

04:59:00.620 --> 04:59:03.404
JON: Okay. Who's the closest to me?

04:59:03.404 --> 04:59:07.287
MATT: Closest to you are the skeletons here, or if
you wanted to rush around and get the guy with the

04:59:07.287 --> 04:59:08.606
big heavy armor.

04:59:08.606 --> 04:59:10.619
JON: That's the old guy?

04:59:10.619 --> 04:59:16.459
MATT: There's an old one with a staff, there's a
black knight in all the armor with the halberd, or

04:59:16.459 --> 04:59:17.726
there's some skeletons.

04:59:17.726 --> 04:59:19.618
JON: Can I make it over to the black knight?

04:59:19.618 --> 04:59:21.080
MATT: Yeah, you can make it over to him.

04:59:21.080 --> 04:59:22.111
JON: Yeah.

04:59:22.111 --> 04:59:25.251
MATT: You get up to him right there.

04:59:25.251 --> 04:59:41.463
JON: Is there any of my teammates? I want to give
bardic inspiration to someone. Are you close? You

04:59:41.463 --> 04:59:47.064
need it? I'm going to give you--

04:59:47.064 --> 04:59:52.393
MARISHA: We're upside-down on the ceiling.

04:59:52.393 --> 04:59:55.163
JON: L-E-T-S-G-O. Let's go, let's go.

04:59:55.163 --> 04:59:57.412
(laughter)

04:59:57.412 --> 04:59:59.683
MARISHA: I'm like, you know how to spell, Lionel!

04:59:59.683 --> 05:00:01.338
JON: That's the only thing I learned.

05:00:01.338 --> 05:00:03.158
MARISHA: I'm so impressed.

05:00:03.158 --> 05:00:04.769
JON: It's the only song I know, but it works.

05:00:04.769 --> 05:00:06.390
MARISHA: How much do I get?

05:00:06.390 --> 05:00:08.414
MATT: You take a d8, I think?

05:00:08.414 --> 05:00:11.237
JON: 1d8 times three per short rest.

05:00:11.237 --> 05:00:13.898
MATT: Yeah, you can use it three times. You get a
d8 inspiration die, Keyleth.

05:00:13.898 --> 05:00:17.325
LIAM and MARISHA: Be aggressive.

05:00:17.325 --> 05:00:25.480
JON: I'm going to do a Hold Person. I want to hold
that guy.

05:00:25.480 --> 05:00:29.187
MATT: All right. He's going to make a wisdom
saving throw. What's your spell DC?

05:00:29.187 --> 05:00:34.935
JON: 16.

05:00:34.935 --> 05:00:37.121
MATT: 16. Natural 20.

05:00:37.121 --> 05:00:39.808
JON: So it doesn't work.

05:00:39.808 --> 05:00:43.747
MATT: No. As you begin to cast the spell on him
and you reach out for his mind to clench it, he

05:00:43.747 --> 05:00:48.412
(chuckles) and readies his halberd. No effect.

05:00:48.412 --> 05:00:54.398
JON: Okay. Don't I have another attack? Is raging
done with now?

05:00:54.398 --> 05:00:58.235
MATT: You're still raging. You can maintain your
rage as long as you're attacking things. You used

05:00:58.235 --> 05:01:01.686
your action to cast the spell instead of
attacking.

05:01:01.686 --> 05:01:03.834
JON: So my turn is done.

05:01:03.834 --> 05:01:08.050
MATT: That's your turn, yeah. Unfortunately.
Sorry, man. All righty, Taryon.

05:01:08.050 --> 05:01:16.806
SAM: I don't think I can get through that thing,
can I? I'll fly up closer to the orb.

05:01:16.806 --> 05:01:19.802
TALIESIN: We still have two cultists full of
magic.

05:01:19.802 --> 05:01:21.150
SAM: Oh. Where are they?

05:01:21.150 --> 05:01:22.666
TALIESIN: They're above you.

05:01:22.666 --> 05:01:23.910
SAM: They're right above me?

05:01:23.910 --> 05:01:25.062
TALIESIN: On the roof.

05:01:25.062 --> 05:01:36.994
SAM: Oh. Well, then I'll attack them, I guess. How
wide is my Prismatic Spray cone?

05:01:36.994 --> 05:01:41.883
MATT: How wide is your Prismatic Spray cone?
What's the cone size on it that it says?

05:01:41.883 --> 05:01:45.264
SAM: It's just the standard Prismatic Spray
spell.

05:01:45.264 --> 05:01:50.358
TALIESIN: It's your everyday Prismatic Spray. It
sprays in a cone.

05:01:50.358 --> 05:01:53.360
It's a sugar cone, not a waffle cone.

05:01:53.360 --> 05:02:04.257
MATT: Prismatic Spray I'm pretty sure is a 60-foot
cone. So it is this big old fun guy.

05:02:04.257 --> 05:02:06.306
What are you doing?

05:02:06.306 --> 05:02:13.168
SAM: Will it hit the protective thing, as well as
the people on the ceiling?

05:02:13.168 --> 05:02:20.832
MATT: You can try and spray them, as it is a cone.
You can aim it up probably to catch the edge of it.

05:02:20.832 --> 05:02:25.153
SAM: I'm mainly aiming at the two dudes above.

05:02:25.153 --> 05:02:33.774
MATT: All right, so you can hit those guys and the
blackguard, if you want to. All righty, so roll a d8.

05:02:33.774 --> 05:02:38.353
SAM: A d8? Just 1d8?

05:02:38.353 --> 05:02:40.449
MATT: For that guy there.

05:02:40.449 --> 05:02:44.152
SAM: Oh, that's right, to pick the color. Four.

05:02:44.152 --> 05:02:48.572
MATT: All righty, that's green, so poison for him.
For the sphere?

05:02:48.572 --> 05:02:50.413
SAM: Seven.

05:02:50.413 --> 05:02:57.099
MATT: Seven for the sphere. That is violet. No
effect. Okay, that guy there?

05:02:57.099 --> 05:02:59.047
SAM: Two.

05:02:59.047 --> 05:03:04.010
MATT: Two. Orange. Acid. And the guard.

05:03:04.010 --> 05:03:07.010
SAM: Five.

05:03:07.010 --> 05:03:18.041
MATT: Five. Cold. All right, so roll 10d6. Failure
for him. Failure for the blackguard, who rolled a

05:03:18.041 --> 05:03:21.209
four. All three of them fail.

05:03:21.209 --> 05:03:38.595
SAM: Okay. (counting) 39.

05:03:38.595 --> 05:03:57.885
MATT: 39. All righty... This war priest over here,
the one on the far end, as you strike. That was

05:03:57.885 --> 05:04:07.969
with the acid ray. The green ray strikes him and
he goes (death rattle) and slowly dissolves into a

05:04:07.969 --> 05:04:17.709
pile of purplish-red mush that begins to smear
across the roof. The other two are impacted by it,

05:04:17.709 --> 05:04:21.640
and they're reeling from the pain. They're
starting to show some real wear and tear now.

05:04:21.719 --> 05:04:24.769
That's going to end yours?

05:04:24.769 --> 05:04:29.128
SAM: Yeah, pretty much. Oh, and I'll fly closer to
the sphere. I said that already.

05:04:29.128 --> 05:04:30.582
MATT: Yeah. Vax.

05:04:30.582 --> 05:04:39.503
LIAM: Oh, I'm up? Lionel is right on that dark
paladin, right?

05:04:39.503 --> 05:04:40.668
MATT: That is correct.

05:04:40.668 --> 05:04:44.510
LIAM: All right. I would like to use my movement
to fly. It's probably not all of it, but 120 feet

05:04:44.510 --> 05:04:47.506
to get to his backside and stab him in the back.

05:04:47.506 --> 05:04:48.870
MATT: You can get there.

05:04:48.870 --> 05:04:50.236
LIAM: We'll start with that.

05:04:50.236 --> 05:04:53.057
MATT: You rush in.

05:04:53.057 --> 05:04:55.990
LIAM: That is a 19.

05:04:55.990 --> 05:04:58.429
MATT: 19 will hit, yes.

05:04:58.429 --> 05:05:08.331
LIAM: All right, so that is sneak attack damage.
He gets three plus eight is 11, plus... where the

05:05:08.331 --> 05:05:32.309
hell did my d8 go? Okay, 16 plus sneak attack
damage. (counting) 45.

05:05:32.309 --> 05:05:33.955
So that guy took 45 in the back.

05:05:33.955 --> 05:05:39.173
MATT: Yes, and as you rush down with the speed of
an elven bullet, you drive the blade right into

05:05:39.173 --> 05:05:43.070
the center of the armor plates, and you watch as
he's chuckling with his glaive out, glaring at

05:05:43.070 --> 05:05:51.180
Lionel. (chuckles, death rattle, thud) And falls
dead to the ground.

05:05:51.180 --> 05:05:56.611
LIAM: Perfect. So that's movement, action, and
what I have left is hasted action and bonus

05:05:56.611 --> 05:06:02.069
action, so I would like to use my bonus action to
zip over to Pike, 120 feet.

05:06:02.069 --> 05:06:04.082
MATT: As a dash. Okay.

05:06:04.082 --> 05:06:11.086
LIAM: Yeah, and use my hasted action to carry her
out of here, out where there's nobody. Towards the

05:06:11.086 --> 05:06:12.582
end of your map.

05:06:12.582 --> 05:06:15.594
MATT: Okay, grabbing her, you can move at half
movement to try and pull her along.

05:06:15.594 --> 05:06:16.830
LIAM: That's 60 feet.

05:06:16.830 --> 05:06:20.710
MATT: Correct. You get her about over here.

05:06:20.710 --> 05:06:22.001
LIAM: That's great.

05:06:22.001 --> 05:06:24.555
MATT: That ends your turn.

05:06:24.555 --> 05:06:29.686
LIAM: I give her a bonus-bonus action to tousle
her hair. Next.

05:06:29.686 --> 05:06:32.514
MATT: Easy enough with the wind blowing around.
Vex.

05:06:32.514 --> 05:06:40.018
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to take aim at the other
cultist. I'm going to Hunter's Mark them. That's

05:06:40.018 --> 05:06:41.701
the old one with the staff?

05:06:41.701 --> 05:06:49.023
MATT: There are two of them that appear to be
staff wielders. The older one has been destroyed with

05:06:49.023 --> 05:06:51.683
acid. The other one you haven't really gotten
close enough to see the face of.

05:06:51.683 --> 05:06:53.194
LAURA: But they're holding a staff?

05:06:53.194 --> 05:06:54.190
MATT: Yeah.

05:06:54.190 --> 05:07:00.787
LAURA: I'm going to bramble shot that one. No.
Yeah, I'm going to bramble shot the one that I

05:07:00.787 --> 05:07:03.552
haven't seen his face yet.

05:07:03.552 --> 05:07:05.116
MATT: Okay, so roll to attack.

05:07:05.116 --> 05:07:10.878
LAURA: That was a 33.

05:07:10.878 --> 05:07:13.189
MATT: Yeah, that will hit. Roll damage.

05:07:13.189 --> 05:07:27.501
LAURA: Okay. (counting) Nobody's standing next to
him, right?

05:07:27.501 --> 05:07:28.861
MATT: Nope.

05:07:28.861 --> 05:07:46.347
LAURA: (counting) 27. So 27 damage, and then DC of
17. Strength DC of 17.

05:07:46.347 --> 05:07:48.507
LIAM: You're a fucking beast.

05:07:48.507 --> 05:07:53.818
MATT: Does not succeed. He is restrained. (grunts)
As you slam with the arrow from the other side,

05:07:53.818 --> 05:07:59.165
(grunts) the vines curl up and wrap around,
constraining him. He's still holding the staff

05:07:59.165 --> 05:08:01.751
through part of it, but he's completely unable to
move and is restrained.

05:08:01.751 --> 05:08:03.478
LAURA: But he's holding the staff, still?

05:08:03.478 --> 05:08:04.522
MATT: Yeah.

05:08:04.522 --> 05:08:07.501
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to hit him again.

05:08:07.501 --> 05:08:08.701
MATT: Go for it.

05:08:08.701 --> 05:08:11.001
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Get him!

05:08:11.001 --> 05:08:15.886
LAURA: I can't fucking add! 22?

05:08:15.886 --> 05:08:19.459
MATT: 22 does hit. Roll damage.

05:08:19.459 --> 05:08:22.953
LAURA: I know.

05:08:22.953 --> 05:08:26.052
MATT: 100th episode, guys.

05:08:26.052 --> 05:08:28.020
TRAVIS: It's extravagant.

05:08:28.020 --> 05:08:30.137
SAM: We're onto our bonus material.

05:08:30.137 --> 05:08:34.065
MATT: I know. I want to finish this to a narrative
beat. Sorry. Thanks for coming along, guys.

05:08:34.065 --> 05:08:36.490
LAURA: Do I get sneak attack because he's
restrained?

05:08:36.490 --> 05:08:37.856
MATT: You do.

05:08:37.856 --> 05:08:39.882
LIAM: Advantage, yeah. Yeah, motherfucker.

05:08:39.882 --> 05:08:50.859
LAURA: That was the shittiest additional four. Oh
no. I don't have any idea

05:08:50.859 --> 05:08:52.701
what I rolled before that.

05:08:52.701 --> 05:08:54.703
MATT: Then roll again.

05:08:54.703 --> 05:09:09.199
LAURA: Oh god. I'm so sorry! (counting) This is so
much better than the first roll. 23, and then.

05:09:09.199 --> 05:09:11.436
33.

05:09:11.436 --> 05:09:19.411
MATT: 33. Got it. All right, so (arrow impact) the
other arrow hits. Blood pours out of the mouth as

05:09:19.411 --> 05:09:23.230
they're being held there. They're trying to break
away, but they're not very strong. End of your

05:09:23.230 --> 05:09:25.709
turn? Trinket?

05:09:25.709 --> 05:09:27.185
LAURA: I'm going to get on my broom.

05:09:27.185 --> 05:09:29.536
MATT: Okay, you get on your broom. You going to
move anywhere?

05:09:29.536 --> 05:09:31.124
LAURA: No, but I'm going to be ready to.

05:09:31.124 --> 05:09:33.625
LIAM: (motorcycle revving)

05:09:33.625 --> 05:09:39.941
MATT: All righty, so the necromancer that you just
hit--

05:09:39.941 --> 05:09:44.796
LAURA: I Hunter's Marked him, too, didn't I? I
didn't add my Hunter's Mark on either of those

05:09:44.796 --> 05:09:48.428
attacks. An additional seven for Hunter's Mark.

05:09:48.428 --> 05:10:04.734
MATT: Okay. All righty. He angrily, from beneath
the vines, gets his staff forward and begins

05:10:04.734 --> 05:10:14.163
chanting something under his breath. Rears back
and exhales, and you watch as a cloud of green,

05:10:14.163 --> 05:10:22.980
billowing, poisonous smoke spills out in this
area. That's going to get all of you guys. I want

05:10:22.980 --> 05:10:30.914
Keyleth, Grog, Lionel, and Percy to all make a
constitution saving throw, please.

05:10:30.914 --> 05:10:32.223
TALIESIN: Is it magical?

05:10:32.223 --> 05:10:34.058
MATT: It is magical. It is a Cloudkill spell.

05:10:34.058 --> 05:10:35.843
TRAVIS: It's not poison, though, right?

05:10:35.843 --> 05:10:37.111
MATT: It is poison.

05:10:37.111 --> 05:10:44.604
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. Ooh, that's not
great. I'm going to go ahead and roll my

05:10:44.604 --> 05:10:48.192
inspiration. That's better.

05:10:48.192 --> 05:10:59.786
MATT: Okay, so you take--

05:10:59.786 --> 05:11:03.486
TRAVIS: I have resistance against poison because
of the Belt of Dwarvenkind.

05:11:03.486 --> 05:11:07.163
MATT: 15 points of poison damage, reduced to
seven.

05:11:07.163 --> 05:11:08.295
TRAVIS: Okay.

05:11:08.295 --> 05:11:09.383
MATT: All right.

05:11:09.383 --> 05:11:11.097
MARISHA: 12.

05:11:11.097 --> 05:11:13.095
MATT: 12. You suffer 30 points of poison damage.

05:11:13.095 --> 05:11:15.309
MARISHA: I'm okay. I'm all right.

05:11:15.309 --> 05:11:16.436
MATT: Lionel?

05:11:16.436 --> 05:11:19.050
MARISHA: How much? 31?

05:11:19.050 --> 05:11:20.294
MATT: 30 points of poison damage.

05:11:20.294 --> 05:11:23.426
JON: 18, but how does off a duck's back work,
again?

05:11:23.426 --> 05:11:26.396
MATT: You use your reaction to reduce the damage
by half.

05:11:26.396 --> 05:11:30.229
JON: Do I have a reaction? Can I do that now?

05:11:30.229 --> 05:11:34.999
MATT: Yes, and you succeed on that, so you
actually reduce it to a quarter, so instead it is

05:11:34.999 --> 05:11:37.262
seven points of poison damage. Percival?

05:11:37.262 --> 05:11:38.609
TALIESIN: I rolled 27.

05:11:38.609 --> 05:11:40.600
MATT: 15 points of poison damage.

05:11:40.600 --> 05:11:43.547
SAM: Off a duck's back? Oh mallard.

05:11:43.547 --> 05:11:49.629
MATT: The cloud remains in this area, so this
whole area is a billowing cloud of bad news.

05:11:49.629 --> 05:11:52.602
LAURA: I assume we didn't hear that terrible pun
from inside the orb of death?

05:11:52.602 --> 05:11:55.266
JON: What was it?

05:11:55.266 --> 05:11:58.650
SAM: I said, oh mal-lard. Oh mallard.

05:11:58.650 --> 05:12:04.444
MATT: Yes, I understand it happens at the start of
their turn, but we're trying to get through this

05:12:04.444 --> 05:12:14.482
quickly, guys. Don't worry. Calming down the
internet. It's fine. Yep. Two skeletons already

05:12:14.482 --> 05:12:16.834
went. That brings us to Pike.

05:12:16.834 --> 05:12:18.845
ASHLEY: Can I do anything?

05:12:18.845 --> 05:12:21.988
MATT: You can move and attack. No spells.

05:12:21.988 --> 05:12:25.254
LAURA: She can attack. Oh, she can't attack.

05:12:25.254 --> 05:12:28.032
LIAM: But we're way in the back.

05:12:28.032 --> 05:12:29.754
SAM: You can't do anything?

05:12:29.754 --> 05:12:33.604
MATT: Not much you can do from this angle,
unfortunately. What do you want to do?

05:12:33.604 --> 05:12:35.372
ASHLEY: There's no rolling against it or
anything?

05:12:35.372 --> 05:12:38.540
MATT: Nope. You get to roll against it in 30
days.

05:12:38.540 --> 05:12:41.750
ASHLEY: Oh, cool. I'll be back in New York.

05:12:41.750 --> 05:12:45.571
TRAVIS: We'll time-jump.

05:12:45.571 --> 05:12:50.233
MARISHA: I can fix it. Just give me a hot second.

05:12:50.233 --> 05:12:51.792
LAURA: What if you die?

05:12:51.792 --> 05:12:53.235
ASHLEY: Yeah, what if you die?

05:12:53.235 --> 05:12:57.045
LIAM: We'll have several problems if Keyleth
dies.

05:12:57.045 --> 05:13:05.057
ASHLEY: Just wander off? I'll start walking back
towards that way.

05:13:05.057 --> 05:13:06.308
MATT: This way?

05:13:06.308 --> 05:13:11.035
ASHLEY: Just start wandering. Yeah.

05:13:11.035 --> 05:13:12.426
MATT: You can dash again.

05:13:12.426 --> 05:13:14.923
ASHLEY: I don't need to dash.

05:13:14.923 --> 05:13:20.162
MATT: Okay. You'll stay back there? We'll say you
get that far. That ends Pike's turn.

05:13:20.162 --> 05:13:21.346
Keyleth, you're up.

05:13:21.346 --> 05:13:23.543
MARISHA: Who's left on the ceiling with me?

05:13:23.543 --> 05:13:27.637
MATT: It's you and Grog and Lionel on the ceiling
with two skeletons.

05:13:27.637 --> 05:13:29.722
MARISHA: Two skeletons? That's it?

05:13:29.722 --> 05:13:31.543
MATT: And one cultist.

05:13:31.543 --> 05:13:33.417
MARISHA: And one fucking cultist?

05:13:33.417 --> 05:13:36.891
JON: He's been pretty hard to kill.

05:13:36.891 --> 05:13:40.241
TALIESIN: I can't help.

05:13:40.241 --> 05:13:55.146
MARISHA: Oh my god. A lot of things have changed
in a hot second. Okay. What's going on right now?

05:13:55.146 --> 05:13:57.283
TALIESIN: I can't help. I'm not allowed to help.

05:13:57.283 --> 05:14:01.069
MARISHA: Where's Delilah?

05:14:01.069 --> 05:14:03.877
LAURA: She's hiding in the ball. We can't get to
her.

05:14:03.877 --> 05:14:06.730
TRAVIS: Smoke everybody outside that bitch.

05:14:06.730 --> 05:14:20.037
MARISHA: I mean, why not? Go big or go home. I'm
going to burn my 9th-level Shapechange and go...

05:14:20.037 --> 05:14:25.507
I'm going to go red dragon?

05:14:25.507 --> 05:14:27.454
MATT: Okay.

05:14:27.454 --> 05:14:30.764
MARISHA: And that's all I can do, right?

05:14:30.764 --> 05:14:32.307
MATT: Yep. That is your action.

05:14:32.307 --> 05:14:36.023
MARISHA: I'm a dragon on the ceiling.

05:14:36.023 --> 05:14:40.989
MATT: You can still move if you want to, but you
are a dragon on the ceiling.

05:14:40.989 --> 05:14:42.969
JON: Cool.

05:14:42.969 --> 05:14:47.506
LIAM: Do you have a giant crate of the things she
can turn into?

05:14:47.506 --> 05:14:53.170
MARISHA: He does. He had to pack a lot of stuff
because of me. I feel mildly guilty.

05:14:53.170 --> 05:14:54.893
MATT: That's fine. What are you doing, Keyleth?

05:14:54.893 --> 05:15:02.811
MARISHA: Can I move, (impacts) giant dragon
walking on the ceiling, and then look down at

05:15:02.811 --> 05:15:07.279
Delilah backwards and upside down and say, hello!

05:15:07.279 --> 05:15:16.768
MATT: You get two attacks of opportunity from the
two skeletons as you step over. 18 and 21.

05:15:16.768 --> 05:15:18.777
MARISHA: No, yes.

05:15:18.777 --> 05:15:25.905
MATT: Take 11 points of slashing damage. Do you
have damage resistance in your dragon form?

05:15:25.905 --> 05:15:27.754
MARISHA: Yeah, I do.

05:15:27.754 --> 05:15:32.600
MATT: You move over and you look down. It's an
orb, it's not a cylinder, so you just see the

05:15:32.600 --> 05:15:37.077
giant red dome. You can't see her because it's a
dome.

05:15:37.077 --> 05:15:38.942
MARISHA: I can't see her.

05:15:38.942 --> 05:15:43.703
MATT: Nope. So, you get up and you glance down.
For the purposes of this, you are currently right

05:15:43.703 --> 05:15:54.934
there and it's just a big red dome. There, it's
fine. Reverse Gravity makes this battlefield so

05:15:54.934 --> 05:15:56.623
easy to keep track of.

05:15:56.623 --> 05:15:58.068
LIAM: Sorry, Matt!

05:15:58.068 --> 05:16:06.440
MATT: It's fine. All right, Keyleth, is that your
go? It was an action to cast it and your move.

05:16:06.440 --> 05:16:11.287
MARISHA: I have Frightful Presence for anyone who
might be terrified of me. That's it.

05:16:11.287 --> 05:16:19.629
MATT: Nobody sees you right now through the
sphere. That ends your turn. All right. Delilah,

05:16:19.629 --> 05:16:29.828
within the sphere, the cultists next to her end up
throwing the last object up and they-- well, no,

05:16:29.828 --> 05:16:34.020
sorry, they have not been throwing it in there
because when the sphere turned, they'd been

05:16:34.030 --> 05:16:42.311
holding in there waiting for a moment. Delilah
glances out and sees the dragon up there, she gets

05:16:42.378 --> 05:16:46.997
to make her save against your Frightful Presence.
That is a 21 wisdom.

05:16:47.067 --> 05:16:48.493
MARISHA: What's that against?

05:16:48.493 --> 05:16:51.076
MATT: The DC of whatever your Frightful Presence
is.

05:16:51.076 --> 05:16:55.518
MARISHA: 19. Versus wisdom save.

05:16:55.518 --> 05:17:01.493
MATT: Wisdom saves, yeah, she makes it. She looks
out, seeing everyone falling apart out there,

05:17:01.493 --> 05:17:12.439
pulls back in, looks at Scanlan and goes, "There's
more important things to do." She grabs her amulet

05:17:12.439 --> 05:17:19.769
that she has around her neck and as she holds it
again, you watch as the white orb that was glowing

05:17:19.769 --> 05:17:37.644
turns to black once again. In that instant, Grog,
you revert back to your regular size, Keyleth, you

05:17:37.644 --> 05:17:48.768
return to your form, Percy, you fall off the side
of the wall and land on your feet barely. The

05:17:48.768 --> 05:17:58.156
skeletons just collapse into piles of bones. Tary,
you fall and land on the ground there. This

05:17:58.156 --> 05:18:01.141
Prismatic Wall vanishes.

05:18:01.141 --> 05:18:06.471
SAM: Does Feeblemind end?

05:18:06.471 --> 05:18:15.789
MATT: Feeblemind, currently, right now, is not
affecting you. Meaning, Feeblemind, whatever the

05:18:15.789 --> 05:18:20.724
spell is right now, doesn't seem to be having an
effect. All of a sudden, your consciousness comes

05:18:20.724 --> 05:18:22.138
back to you.

05:18:22.138 --> 05:18:23.907
ASHLEY: Really?!

05:18:23.907 --> 05:18:25.289
MATT: Uh-huh.

05:18:25.289 --> 05:18:27.211
ASHLEY: Oh, fucking hell!

05:18:27.211 --> 05:18:34.385
MATT: She, clutching the amulet, gives a nod to
the two other cultists and all three of them step

05:18:34.385 --> 05:18:40.830
into the black orb. You watch as their forms
(whooshing noises) and vanish.

05:18:40.830 --> 05:18:42.473
TRAVIS: They disapparated.

05:18:42.473 --> 05:18:45.903
ASHLEY: They stepped into the circle?

05:18:45.903 --> 05:18:47.088
MATT: Yep!

05:18:47.088 --> 05:18:50.569
LAURA: The orb, they went into the orb!

05:18:50.569 --> 05:18:56.361
TRAVIS: They're moving freely and it looked like
pretty familiarly--

05:18:56.361 --> 05:18:58.050
MATT: Through the sphere.

05:18:58.050 --> 05:19:05.034
MARISHA: They went into the thing! They're gone
forever!

05:19:05.034 --> 05:19:06.296
TALIESIN: No!

05:19:06.296 --> 05:19:08.035
TRAVIS: And they've done it before.

05:19:08.035 --> 05:19:10.232
LAURA: That's how they got over here!

05:19:10.232 --> 05:19:12.239
MATT: Scanlan, I want you to roll a perception
check.

05:19:12.239 --> 05:19:20.089
SAM: Not great. Five.

05:19:20.089 --> 05:19:21.640
MATT: Okay. Never mind.

05:19:21.640 --> 05:19:27.821
MARISHA: If she went in the tiny thing.

05:19:27.821 --> 05:19:29.157
MATT: Yep!

05:19:29.157 --> 05:19:35.420
MARISHA: I still have Shapechange for another
hour.

05:19:35.420 --> 05:19:37.183
SAM: No, it's gone, you're done.

05:19:37.183 --> 05:19:42.430
MARISHA: Wait, did she cancel my spell, or is it
just the orb that's done?

05:19:42.430 --> 05:19:46.329
MATT: You sense the concentration is still there,
but the spell has no effect where you currently

05:19:46.329 --> 05:19:55.209
are. By the way, Lionel and Grog, you both
(falling sounds) slamming into the ground.

05:19:55.209 --> 05:19:56.486
TRAVIS: Dexterity?

05:19:56.486 --> 05:20:05.521
MATT: Nope! You guys suffer 15 points of
bludgeoning damage. So, reduced to half for both

05:20:05.521 --> 05:20:08.413
of you because you're raging, so seven bludgeoning
damage each.

05:20:08.501 --> 05:20:10.407
LIAM: And are the wings schlorped back in?

05:20:10.407 --> 05:20:11.938
MATT: Yes. Your wings (retracting sound).

05:20:11.938 --> 05:20:14.947
JON: Mine says "while raging, resist bludgeoning
damage."

05:20:14.947 --> 05:20:16.499
MATT: That's what I'm saying, you're taking half
damage from this.

05:20:16.499 --> 05:20:17.930
You take seven, as opposed to 15.

05:20:17.930 --> 05:20:20.551
SAM: Am I still there?

05:20:20.551 --> 05:20:22.521
MATT: You're still there, right next to the orb.

05:20:22.521 --> 05:20:31.290
TALIESIN: I am going to unload a couple shots into
the orb and see what happens.

05:20:31.290 --> 05:20:35.509
MATT: Okay, go ahead and take a shot.

05:20:35.509 --> 05:20:45.129
TALIESIN: Animus freezes up, I throw it. Pull Bad
News. Bad News freezes up.

05:20:45.129 --> 05:20:48.178
I pull Retort. That hits.

05:20:48.178 --> 05:20:59.607
MATT: Technically, fire, discard, quick draw,
right? Quick draw means you can do it as a free

05:20:59.607 --> 05:21:00.838
action as a part of it?

05:21:00.838 --> 05:21:03.878
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll burn an action surge for
this.

05:21:03.878 --> 05:21:08.822
MATT: We'll say because you only used your bonus
action to-- oh, not to reload. As a quick draw,

05:21:08.822 --> 05:21:13.008
you can pull it as an attack, you're fine. So, you
do three attacks, the third one fires. You fire

05:21:13.008 --> 05:21:15.263
(bullet) and it vanishes into the orb.

05:21:15.263 --> 05:21:20.115
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit and fix my guns.

05:21:20.115 --> 05:21:22.160
TRAVIS: Are there any enemies left on the map?

05:21:22.160 --> 05:21:26.197
MATT: Currently, there's the one right there who's
being held by the brambles. The brambles have

05:21:26.197 --> 05:21:33.071
vanished, and he's currently still conscious, and
it's not his turn yet. So, Percy took all the

05:21:33.071 --> 05:21:36.218
shots into the orb. It is now Scanlan's turn.

05:21:36.218 --> 05:21:46.709
SAM: I will draw my blade and scream and hit that
thing with my sword. No, the guy!

05:21:46.709 --> 05:21:48.351
The guy, not the orb.

05:21:48.351 --> 05:21:54.754
MATT: You rush towards the guy as the brambles
wither away and fall to the ground. He turns

05:21:54.754 --> 05:22:00.572
around to rush towards the orb just as you rush
towards him. Your bardic battle cry just "Argh!"

05:22:00.572 --> 05:22:03.053
with Mythcarver. Go ahead and make your attack.

05:22:03.053 --> 05:22:08.764
SAM: Jon's dice. 11 plus I think it's ten.
Somewhere.

05:22:08.764 --> 05:22:11.565
MATT: That'll hit. His armor class isn't very
high; it's just a mage armor of 15.

05:22:11.565 --> 05:22:13.109
LAURA: Yay!

05:22:13.109 --> 05:22:19.512
SAM: It's just a sword; it's not even magical now.
Shit, I can't find anything,

05:22:19.512 --> 05:22:21.105
I think it's 1d8 plus two.

05:22:21.105 --> 05:22:22.512
MATT: It's 1d8 plus your strength.

05:22:22.512 --> 05:22:24.875
SAM: 1d8 plus three. Right?

05:22:24.875 --> 05:22:29.546
MATT: Well, it doesn't have a magical bonus right
now. So just 1d8 plus your strength modifier.

05:22:29.546 --> 05:22:30.916
What's your strength modifier?

05:22:30.916 --> 05:22:36.438
SAM: I can't even find it. I think it's one, but
this is an old sheet.

05:22:36.438 --> 05:22:38.266
MATT: So, 1d8 plus one, your strength hasn't gone
up.

05:22:38.266 --> 05:22:43.699
SAM: Thank you. Seven.

05:22:43.699 --> 05:22:45.278
MATT: Seven damage.

05:22:45.278 --> 05:22:46.967
SAM: Plus one. So eight damage.

05:22:46.967 --> 05:22:49.315
MATT: Eight damage. How do you want to do this,
Scanlan?

05:22:49.315 --> 05:22:52.938
LAURA: The most lackluster how do you want to do
this!

05:22:52.938 --> 05:22:55.333
MATT: He had, like, three hit points left. How do
you want to do this?

05:22:55.333 --> 05:23:06.269
SAM: I'll just stab him in his toes over and over
and I'll say, this is what you get for separating

05:23:06.269 --> 05:23:12.147
me from my friends! Who I want to be around
forever because I love them! Is this what we're

05:23:12.147 --> 05:23:13.759
supposed to do now, is this the thing?

05:23:13.759 --> 05:23:14.913
TRAVIS: Don't question it.

05:23:14.913 --> 05:23:16.480
SAM: Okay. Yeah, my friends!

05:23:16.480 --> 05:23:20.751
MATT: As you repeatedly stab it in the feet, he's
like, "Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!" and it's like trying

05:23:20.751 --> 05:23:25.595
to pull away from you down the side of the pyramid
ziggurat. "What are you doing?!" as you keep

05:23:25.595 --> 05:23:31.815
stabbing it over and over again into the feet
until it falls unconscious. Bleeding out through

05:23:31.815 --> 05:23:34.852
his ankles. How very Scanlan.

05:23:34.852 --> 05:23:38.518
TRAVIS: Through his ankles.

05:23:38.518 --> 05:23:40.781
LAURA: (laughing) That is the stupidest death!

05:23:40.781 --> 05:23:43.734
TRAVIS: All right, we're going in the little
sphere. Here we go.

05:23:43.734 --> 05:23:44.766
LAURA: No!

05:23:44.766 --> 05:23:47.991
MARISHA: So, what? What?

05:23:47.991 --> 05:23:49.782
TRAVIS: No, no, no.

05:23:49.782 --> 05:23:56.248
MARISHA: So it's only a dark magical, anti-magical
field because she &lt;i&gt;wants&lt;/i&gt; it to be?!

05:23:56.248 --> 05:23:57.683
TRAVIS: She manipulated it.

05:23:57.683 --> 05:23:59.114
LAURA: She turned it into that.

05:23:59.114 --> 05:24:00.103
MARISHA: Which means--

05:24:00.103 --> 05:24:03.000
LAURA: She succeeded on the previous one. This a
pathway into some other world now.

05:24:03.000 --> 05:24:04.807
MARISHA: She can change it!

05:24:04.807 --> 05:24:11.031
JON: She did something. It was black before, then
she turned it white, and I don't know if that

05:24:11.031 --> 05:24:15.898
allowed magic. But when she turned it black
again, all magic stops, so.

05:24:15.898 --> 05:24:17.979
TRAVIS: Which is like the one that we've been
around.

05:24:17.979 --> 05:24:19.886
LIAM: I mean, she knows what she's doing.

05:24:19.886 --> 05:24:23.165
TRAVIS: Who has Speak with Dead?

05:24:23.165 --> 05:24:25.718
LAURA: We can't do anything in here.

05:24:25.718 --> 05:24:29.397
TALIESIN: We're going to drag this cadaver
outside.

05:24:29.397 --> 05:24:31.090
LAURA: Okay, let's take the cadaver outside.

05:24:31.090 --> 05:24:36.313
MARISHA: So, it's just very strong magic which
makes her change what it is?

05:24:36.313 --> 05:24:41.815
LIAM: She knows how it works. We don't know why
she's here, but she

05:24:41.815 --> 05:24:43.758
figured shit out the last time.

05:24:43.758 --> 05:24:49.030
LAURA: We fucking killed her. How did we kill her
before? How did she die?

05:24:49.030 --> 05:24:53.743
MATT: You killed her in the hallway as she was
trying to escape back to Castle Whitestone when you

05:24:53.743 --> 05:24:55.029
were fighting Orthax.

05:24:55.029 --> 05:24:56.498
LAURA: Like, she fully fucking died.

05:24:56.498 --> 05:24:58.364
MATT: You killed her and threw her body in the
acid pit.

05:24:58.364 --> 05:25:00.545
LAURA: Holy shit.

05:25:00.545 --> 05:25:01.658
TALIESIN: Yeah.

05:25:01.658 --> 05:25:03.603
TRAVIS: Not a lot of remains to be, you know.

05:25:03.603 --> 05:25:05.110
TALIESIN: Resurrected.

05:25:05.182 --> 05:25:07.157
MARISHA: All of their magic was necromantic.

05:25:07.157 --> 05:25:11.488
SAM: What if it's just her soul or something?

05:25:11.488 --> 05:25:13.463
LAURA: What if it's not really her?

05:25:13.463 --> 05:25:16.915
TRAVIS: Well, listen, we're not going in the orb,
right?

05:25:16.915 --> 05:25:17.861
TALIESIN: No.

05:25:17.861 --> 05:25:21.314
TRAVIS: Yeah, so let's drag one of these
smart-looking fucks outside and have Pike do

05:25:21.314 --> 05:25:22.515
Twenty Questions.

05:25:22.515 --> 05:25:26.101
SAM: I'm a little worried that once we walk
outside, Pike becomes dumb again.

05:25:26.101 --> 05:25:31.453
LAURA: Well, she can Greater Restoration her as
soon as we walk outside.

05:25:31.453 --> 05:25:32.694
MARISHA: I can.

05:25:32.694 --> 05:25:37.337
TALIESIN: Let's take this outside. Just take it
outside. Nothing good happens here.

05:25:37.337 --> 05:25:46.880
MARISHA: Wait, before we go. Pike, does Sarenrae
know anything about this? Anything?

05:25:46.880 --> 05:25:50.364
ASHLEY: I can check.

05:25:50.364 --> 05:25:51.944
TRAVIS: Sam, I think you're right.

05:25:51.944 --> 05:25:54.107
TALIESIN: You're just going to waste your attempt
in here.

05:25:54.107 --> 05:25:56.310
JON: There might be some ducks.

05:25:56.310 --> 05:26:00.313
MATT: Are you going to try to have a brief
communion with Sarenrae in the temple?

05:26:00.313 --> 05:26:02.244
LAURA: I mean, you could try.

05:26:02.244 --> 05:26:05.906
LIAM: If you lose your brain, you can't do it, so
why not?

05:26:05.906 --> 05:26:07.268
ASHLEY: I'll try.

05:26:07.268 --> 05:26:14.250
MATT: You drop to your knees for a moment and
concentrate, hoping for her wisdom. Go ahead and

05:26:14.250 --> 05:26:17.888
make a general wisdom check. Roll a d20 and add
your wisdom modifier. Plus five.

05:26:17.888 --> 05:26:19.106
ASHLEY: Wisdom modifier?

05:26:19.106 --> 05:26:21.288
MATT: Yeah, I believe it's plus five.

05:26:21.288 --> 05:26:26.059
ASHLEY: Okay. 22.

05:26:26.059 --> 05:26:32.805
MATT: 22. As you concentrate, you feel the warmth
of Sarenrae's embrace descend from the darkness of

05:26:32.805 --> 05:26:39.999
the inside of your eyelids. You see the angelic
form of her flaming aura come down and her hands

05:26:39.999 --> 05:26:47.455
touch the sides of your cheek. She turns your head
around towards the orb. And, where previously you

05:26:47.455 --> 05:26:57.252
saw the little black dot, instead, you see a large
oval doorway. Around it, it is flickering madly

05:26:57.252 --> 05:27:03.757
like a hundred spinning razors around the edges,
but just beyond it you can see what appears to be

05:27:03.757 --> 05:27:12.450
a desolate, gray landscape, what looks to be a
scattering of city buildings across this broken,

05:27:12.450 --> 05:27:20.650
black shadowland, and in the center a singular
black obsidian tower that rises up to where you

05:27:20.650 --> 05:27:26.631
can't quite see the top from your current angle.
And she gets down really close to the side of your

05:27:26.631 --> 05:27:35.151
ear. You feel the warmth of her divine breath
against your face. She says, "This is the destiny.

05:27:35.151 --> 05:27:42.781
"This needs to stop. Only terror will come through
this."

05:27:42.781 --> 05:27:48.385
ASHLEY: We have to go there?

05:27:48.385 --> 05:27:54.558
MATT: "Whatever way you can. Our reach cannot go
beyond the Divine Gate."

05:27:54.558 --> 05:28:01.344
ASHLEY: If I go there, will you not be able to go
with me?

05:28:01.344 --> 05:28:05.430
MATT: "I will be diminished, if at all able to."

05:28:05.430 --> 05:28:14.800
ASHLEY: Okay. Thank you.

05:28:14.800 --> 05:28:20.040
MATT: And her finger touches your head and she
kisses the top of your forehead and you feel the

05:28:20.040 --> 05:28:27.229
warm presence again, and she withdraws. As she
withdraws, the cold is even harder with her

05:28:27.229 --> 05:28:33.734
absence because now the proximity of that shadow,
of this room, just this general sense of negative

05:28:33.734 --> 05:28:39.241
energy and death that emanates from this direction
behind you. As soon as you watch her light vanish

05:28:39.241 --> 05:28:42.411
and you open your eyes again, you're chilled to
the bone.

05:28:42.411 --> 05:29:02.299
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, it's a doorway, and we have to
go there. It's the only way to stop this.

05:29:02.299 --> 05:29:04.281
LAURA: Stop what?

05:29:04.281 --> 05:29:08.482
ASHLEY: I don't know.

05:29:08.482 --> 05:29:14.838
LAURA: Well, we can't go through now.

05:29:14.838 --> 05:29:19.546
TALIESIN: Can't we?

05:29:19.546 --> 05:29:28.709
MARISHA: Is it just like this now? Like the
ziggurat in Whitestone?

05:29:28.709 --> 05:29:34.269
TALIESIN: I don't know. Can't we?

05:29:34.269 --> 05:29:36.280
TRAVIS: Yeah, we can.

05:29:36.280 --> 05:29:42.423
LAURA: Oh, fuck. But, we're not even healed. They
just went through. We're going to go through and

05:29:42.423 --> 05:29:44.127
just die immediately.

05:29:44.127 --> 05:29:49.342
SAM: We have to go at least find out if the spells
are still affecting us.

05:29:49.342 --> 05:29:51.940
If we go through and Pike's dumb--

05:29:51.940 --> 05:29:53.718
ASHLEY: Maybe we should back out.

05:29:53.718 --> 05:30:02.664
MARISHA: The last time I put my hand in the sphere
when it was black it nearly tore me apart. We

05:30:02.664 --> 05:30:04.212
could try again.

05:30:04.212 --> 05:30:06.107
LAURA: It was just a doorway?

05:30:06.107 --> 05:30:13.673
ASHLEY: It was a doorway, and it opened into a
city of sorts and in the middle

05:30:13.673 --> 05:30:16.179
was an obsidian tower.

05:30:16.179 --> 05:30:17.995
LAURA: That's what I saw through the other one!

05:30:17.995 --> 05:30:19.338
ASHLEY: Okay.

05:30:19.338 --> 05:30:22.036
LIAM: Do I feel anything? Sense anything?

05:30:22.036 --> 05:30:24.519
MATT: In what way?

05:30:24.519 --> 05:30:26.665
LIAM: From my patron.

05:30:26.665 --> 05:30:28.600
MATT: Do you wish to try to concentrate there?

05:30:28.600 --> 05:30:29.725
LIAM: Yeah.

05:30:29.725 --> 05:30:33.702
MATT: Make a wisdom check. d20, add your wisdom
modifier.

05:30:33.702 --> 05:30:45.625
LIAM: Use my last Luck of the day. Same thing.
It's shit. Seven.

05:30:45.625 --> 05:30:53.709
MATT: Seven? You concentrate and you get the sense
that the proximity of this orb and something about

05:30:53.709 --> 05:31:06.603
the nature of this whole occurrence is interfering
with your connection with your deity temporarily.

05:31:06.603 --> 05:31:09.857
You try and reach out to her, but nothing is
returning your call.

05:31:09.857 --> 05:31:17.545
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's step out of the range, see
what happens.

05:31:17.545 --> 05:31:23.525
LAURA: Can we back out and see how far the range
goes? Is it the same distance as our ziggurat?

05:31:23.525 --> 05:31:26.566
MATT: So, you drag a body, you said?

05:31:26.566 --> 05:31:28.535
LAURA: Yeah, one of the bodies.

05:31:28.535 --> 05:31:29.983
TRAVIS: Which one, the dark paladin?

05:31:29.983 --> 05:31:31.826
LIAM: Yeah, that asshole.

05:31:31.826 --> 05:31:41.269
MATT: So, you take the black guard, drag it behind
you. The rest of you all continue down the

05:31:41.269 --> 05:31:50.271
pathway. You get to about where that
T-intersection was and Pike,

05:31:50.271 --> 05:31:51.988
your brain goes numb once more.

05:31:51.988 --> 05:31:54.122
ASHLEY: (laughing) No!

05:31:54.122 --> 05:32:01.256
MARISHA: Keyleth goes over to Pike and puts her
palm on her head and casts Greater Restoration.

05:32:01.256 --> 05:32:08.009
MATT: The spell immediately loses its hold and you
regain control of your facilities.

05:32:08.009 --> 05:32:16.639
ASHLEY: Disaster averted, Keyleth. I throw my arms
around her and I kiss her on the forehead,

05:32:16.639 --> 05:32:17.768
on the cheek.

05:32:17.768 --> 05:32:19.634
LAURA: Just full on her lips.

05:32:19.634 --> 05:32:21.420
ASHLEY: Sorry, I'm just so intense.

05:32:21.420 --> 05:32:25.369
MARISHA: The amount you've saved us. It's nothing.
I've learned it from you.

05:32:25.369 --> 05:32:29.051
ASHLEY: Okay, do we need to talk to this dead
person?

05:32:29.051 --> 05:32:30.118
TRAVIS: Yeah.

05:32:30.118 --> 05:32:31.284
MARISHA: No.

05:32:31.284 --> 05:32:33.782
TRAVIS: What? We don't need to talk to this dead
person?

05:32:33.782 --> 05:32:36.607
MARISHA: Sorry, I was answering a different
question. Continue.

05:32:36.607 --> 05:32:37.918
TRAVIS: Do it.

05:32:37.918 --> 05:32:40.454
ASHLEY: I'll cast Speak with Dead.

05:32:40.454 --> 05:32:46.217
MATT: Speak with Dead. You watch the plate armor
rouse ever so slightly as the fresh corpse begins

05:32:46.217 --> 05:32:53.124
to clink and tense against the metal plates. You
hear the creaking sound of breath trying to escape

05:32:53.124 --> 05:32:57.856
from the reedy thin slit where, apparently, part
of the dagger blow that you had shoved in the back

05:32:57.856 --> 05:33:00.518
of its neck went through and cut part of the vocal
cards.

05:33:00.518 --> 05:33:02.324
LAURA: Eww! Fucking gross!

05:33:02.324 --> 05:33:05.283
MATT: You have its attention.

05:33:05.283 --> 05:33:10.822
ASHLEY: Is this one of the ones where his eye is
missing, is he one of those guys?

05:33:10.822 --> 05:33:15.039
MATT: As you glance closer to the black guard,
because the helmet's still on, you'd have to pull

05:33:15.039 --> 05:33:16.362
the helmet off.

05:33:16.362 --> 05:33:19.866
ASHLEY: He's the guy with the-- yeah. Pull it off
for sure.

05:33:19.866 --> 05:33:21.949
MATT: Pull the helmet off-- it's missing its eye.

05:33:21.949 --> 05:33:26.051
SAM: By the way, while this is going on, I'm
dragging Doty out.

05:33:26.051 --> 05:33:28.020
MATT: Okay. (creaking)

05:33:28.020 --> 05:33:31.960
LAURA: I help. Trinket helps, too, because he's
stronger.

05:33:31.960 --> 05:33:35.521
ASHLEY: Okay, what do we want to know?

05:33:35.521 --> 05:33:38.665
MATT: Five questions.

05:33:38.665 --> 05:33:40.209
ASHLEY: Why an eye is missing?

05:33:40.209 --> 05:33:42.773
TRAVIS: How they access the gate.

05:33:42.773 --> 05:33:44.458
TALIESIN: What is it?

05:33:44.458 --> 05:33:48.051
LIAM: You've got five?

05:33:48.051 --> 05:33:49.190
ASHLEY: Five.

05:33:49.190 --> 05:33:51.851
LIAM: Is the gate safe for us to travel?

05:33:51.851 --> 05:34:17.835
ASHLEY: Who do you work for? Okay. Is it safe for
any of us to get through the gate?

05:34:17.835 --> 05:34:29.331
MATT: You can see the lips are curled back against
the teeth and the skin is stretched tight against

05:34:29.331 --> 05:34:37.663
the skull. While once living, this had some sort
of necrotic twisting to its flesh, whether it be

05:34:37.663 --> 05:34:43.702
by proximity or practice. But the jaws open.
(gasping) Through the jaw doesn't move, you hear

05:34:43.702 --> 05:34:58.415
the escaping thin air forming words that say, "You
need one of the crafted stones to pass unharmed."

05:34:58.415 --> 05:35:02.172
LAURA: Or the blade, the sphere!

05:35:02.172 --> 05:35:12.450
MATT: (gasping) "Or be hearty enough to survive
its ravishing doorway."

05:35:12.450 --> 05:35:22.010
ASHLEY: Who do you serve?

05:35:22.010 --> 05:35:33.819
MATT: "We are the Remnants. Small parts of the
whole, given purpose to come together and remake

05:35:33.819 --> 05:35:36.568
"the vessel of the Undying King."

05:35:36.568 --> 05:35:45.490
ASHLEY: Why do you have one eye missing?

05:35:45.490 --> 05:35:55.018
MATT: "To bequeath ourselves of the highest
Remnant order to the Whispered One is to gift our

05:35:55.018 --> 05:36:01.428
"sight like he did. Be granted knowledge he
keeps."

05:36:01.428 --> 05:36:04.920
LAURA: There's only two more questions left.

05:36:04.920 --> 05:36:10.765
LIAM: Suggestion. How did Ripley return--

05:36:10.765 --> 05:36:12.141
LAURA: Not Ripley. Delilah.

05:36:12.141 --> 05:36:13.723
LIAM: That's what I meant to say. Delilah.

05:36:13.723 --> 05:36:14.676
ASHLEY: Was that Delilah?

05:36:14.676 --> 05:36:15.865
LAURA and LIAM: Yeah.

05:36:15.865 --> 05:36:18.161
LIAM: How did Delilah return?

05:36:18.161 --> 05:36:23.159
ASHLEY: I have one job!

05:36:23.159 --> 05:36:25.043
LAURA: It's stupid!

05:36:25.043 --> 05:36:27.164
ASHLEY: How did Delilah return?

05:36:27.164 --> 05:36:38.186
MATT: "I know not the means. But she is a powerful
necromancer, and with the right preparation, even

05:36:38.186 --> 05:36:40.689
"death can be averted."

05:36:40.689 --> 05:36:46.128
ASHLEY: What did you say?

05:36:46.128 --> 05:37:02.843
LAURA: Or, do they have plans to attack through
the orbs? Or how many orbs are there on this plane?

05:37:02.843 --> 05:37:10.106
LIAM: He didn't know the answer to the last one.
So he might not know the answer.

05:37:10.106 --> 05:37:16.752
LAURA: Yeah, are there plans to come through the
orbs?

05:37:16.752 --> 05:37:20.513
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's a great one.

05:37:20.513 --> 05:37:24.534
LIAM: Is there anything that Delilah is afraid
of?

05:37:24.534 --> 05:37:26.836
LAURA: Nah, he wouldn't know that.

05:37:26.836 --> 05:37:35.725
ASHLEY: What are your plans? What are The
Remnants' plans?

05:37:35.725 --> 05:37:47.204
MATT: The whisper becomes a slight chuckle.
(chuckling) "His return is nigh. The Whispered One

05:37:47.204 --> 05:37:58.031
"will come. His acolytes will help him complete his
destiny through the Ritual of Seeding. From within

05:37:58.031 --> 05:38:08.343
"the gate he will rise, the solitary tyrant and
lord of Exandria. And with the sole crown of

05:38:08.343 --> 05:38:19.046
"creation guarded upon his head, we who were his
body will be rewarded with life eternal at his side."

05:38:19.046 --> 05:38:23.312
(gasping) And the spell fades.

05:38:23.312 --> 05:38:26.153
TALIESIN: Did he not have one more?

05:38:26.153 --> 05:38:27.743
MATT: That was five questions.

05:38:27.743 --> 05:38:30.973
LAURA: Great.

05:38:30.973 --> 05:38:38.927
MATT: As you sit here in the cavern, contemplating
what these words mean, what the next step of your

05:38:38.927 --> 05:38:46.994
accelerated involvement in this plot, we're going
to end tonight's episode. Ran a little over, guys;

05:38:46.994 --> 05:38:49.247
hundredth episode, that's a record.

05:38:49.247 --> 05:38:54.068
MARISHA: What time is it? 12:41! Oh my god!

05:38:54.068 --> 05:38:56.175
LIAM: 12:41?!

05:38:56.175 --> 05:38:58.022
LAURA: Is that the longest we've ever gone?

05:38:58.022 --> 05:39:04.029
MATT: Holy shit. For those who are still here,
hanging out, thank you for staying! For those who

05:39:04.029 --> 05:39:05.735
aren't, enjoy your two-parter!

05:39:05.735 --> 05:39:10.755
MARISHA: A lot to unpack, there.

05:39:10.755 --> 05:39:12.672
TALIESIN: Tune in next week for a shopping
episode.

05:39:12.672 --> 05:39:14.423
LAURA: Yeah, for sure.

05:39:14.423 --> 05:39:16.252
TALIESIN: Critical Role goes to the beach.

05:39:16.252 --> 05:39:18.803
LIAM: Scanlan, Taryon. Wow.

05:39:18.803 --> 05:39:20.102
TALIESIN: Doty.

05:39:20.102 --> 05:39:22.612
MARISHA: The eight characters on this side of the
table.

05:39:22.612 --> 05:39:26.679
MATT: Yeah, seriously. Dude, thank you again, Jon,
for joining us!

05:39:26.679 --> 05:39:30.777
(cheering)

05:39:30.777 --> 05:39:33.961
MATT: Thank you guys so much for watching. Thank
you for being part of our hundredth episode.

05:39:33.961 --> 05:39:36.799
LAURA: Thank you, Marvel Puzzle Quest!

05:39:36.799 --> 05:39:40.930
MATT: Thank you, Marvel Puzzle Quest for being our
amazing sponsor. Thank you, Critters, for being

05:39:40.930 --> 05:39:45.804
amazing. I'm going to get my, like, four hours of
sleep before getting on a plane to a convention.

05:39:45.804 --> 05:39:48.689
So I'll see you guys in Texas!

05:39:48.689 --> 05:39:51.246
LIAM: Real soon.

05:39:51.246 --> 05:39:58.898
MATT: Yep. Anyway, love you all. Have a wonderful
night, and is it Thursday yet? Good night!

05:39:58.898 --> 05:46:36.360
