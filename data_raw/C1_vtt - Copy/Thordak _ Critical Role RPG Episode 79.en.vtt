00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:04.638
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:13.461
nerdy-ass voi-- (gibberish) voice actors. It's
been a long year, a lot of us voice actors-- Look,

00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:17.822
there's very high nerves in the studio right now
'cause tonight's going to be crazy. A bunch of us

00:00:17.822 --> 00:00:21.226
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. Tonight's going to be an

00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:26.339
intense episode but before we get to that, let's
go ahead and get through our announcements for the

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:32.031
evening. First and foremost, we have an amazing
sponsor tonight. We have Backblaze.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:34.870
(cheering)

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.665
LAURA: We love you, Yev!

00:00:36.665 --> 00:00:40.225
MATT: Our final episode of the year. So Sam, you
have a few words on that?

00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:44.911
SAM: Yeah well, you know Backblaze is unlimited
cloud backup for Macs and PCs for just $5 a month.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:52.675
You can go to backblaze.com/criticalrole for a
full 15-day free trial, and I was going through my

00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:55.516
library. You know I have a whole library?

00:00:55.516 --> 00:00:57.303
MATT: It's pretty impressive, actually.

00:00:57.303 --> 00:01:03.965
SAM: Yeah and I dug up an old poetry book and
buried inside there was a very curious poem by a

00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:06.459
young Dr. Seuss.

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:08.043
TRAVIS: Oh really?

00:01:08.043 --> 00:01:09.617
SAM: Yeah.

00:01:09.617 --> 00:01:10.929
MATT: That's worth a lot of money.

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:13.253
SAM: I know, I know. I thought I would read it for
you all today.

00:01:13.253 --> 00:01:15.014
TRAVIS: Doesn't even look yellowed or anything.

00:01:15.014 --> 00:01:17.176
SAM: He printed it on his laser printer.

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:18.168
TRAVIS: Oh good.

00:01:18.168 --> 00:01:19.657
(laughter)

00:01:19.657 --> 00:01:25.838
SAM: But it happens to concern Backblaze. The
drive did not spin. It just clacked and it

00:01:25.838 --> 00:01:31.891
clicked. I rebooted and prayed and gave it a swift
kick. But my data was gone, poof, every byte and

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:37.959
bit. And I cried, "How I wish I had backed up my
shit!" But who should appear in a car that he

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:45.205
revved? A zingity zangity furry red Yev. The Yev
jumped through my window, he pounced on my mouse

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:50.417
and said, "You must have wished Backblaze to your
house." But I looked at him cross, shouting, "What

00:01:50.417 --> 00:01:55.783
"do you mean? My files are corrupt. This is one
dead machine." He just laughed and said, "You daft

00:01:55.783 --> 00:02:02.779
"binkle blot, Backblaze works whether you remember
or not. Your pics of your kids and the food that they

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:09.255
"eated, all stored on the cloud. Nothing's ever
deleted. Your docs, Firefox, alarm clocks, and

00:02:09.255 --> 00:02:14.849
"your socks will all be restored from our miracle
box." The Yev yelled, "Don't worry from midnight

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:23.064
"to morn, we save all your stuff, your taxes and
porn. Your music and apps are safe on Backblaze."

00:02:23.064 --> 00:02:28.635
And with that, the Yev tipped his hat, "Good day."
So remember, go visit backblaze.com and find the

00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:34.019
red Yev sing-singing his song. Let them take care
of you heart and soul and tell him you're sent

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.203
there by Critical Role.

00:02:36.203 --> 00:02:41.356
TRAVIS: Damn! Man, I don't know if that was Dr.
Seuss or Lin-Manuel but that was great.

00:02:41.356 --> 00:02:50.788
LIAM: It was sweet and offensive. By the way, Sam,
that's a very handsome hoodie you're wearing. I

00:02:50.788 --> 00:02:53.318
can't wait to open you up like an advent calendar
later.

00:02:53.318 --> 00:03:02.280
SAM: Oh! There's nothing offensive to Matt Mercer
under this shirt. It's just another shirt

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.261
progression to inspire us. This one goes four
deep.

00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:10.509
(yelling)

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.303
LAURA: It looks like your tiny little weenus is--

00:03:13.303 --> 00:03:16.451
TRAVIS: You're shirt-cocking your own mouth!

00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:20.338
MATT: I am so happy!

00:03:20.338 --> 00:03:32.160
SAM: It's to inspire us in our final fights. It
might be the last time I'm ever on this show, so I

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.460
wanted it to be five of me.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.435
MATT: For the power of five Sams. Thank you, Sam,
and thank you, Backblaze, for being our awesome

00:03:40.435 --> 00:03:44.296
sponsor for our episode tonight. You guys are
awesome. We have a great video for you to watch

00:03:44.296 --> 00:03:45.823
from them at the break.

00:03:45.823 --> 00:03:51.257
LAURA: Wait. Can I say, Yev, about the stuff? All
the little pictures you see in the different

00:03:51.257 --> 00:04:00.059
videos, he's giving some of those away tonight?
Giving some away! If you sign up for Backblaze or

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:04.553
if you have signed up for Backblaze already,
you're entered into the competition. And then you

00:04:04.553 --> 00:04:09.345
can win them, and we've signed them, and it's
wonderful. Did I say it right?

00:04:09.345 --> 00:04:10.476
SAM: Yep, you did great.

00:04:10.476 --> 00:04:11.532
LAURA: Okay. Cool.

00:04:11.532 --> 00:04:18.063
MATT: It was pretty bad. As a quick addendum,
while they're not officially sponsoring the show

00:04:18.063 --> 00:04:21.965
tonight, our friends at Loot Crate, who sponsored
us for a large portion of the year as well, wanted

00:04:21.965 --> 00:04:26.140
us to give you a heads up about their current Halo
Legendary crate. It's filled with a bunch of

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.033
exclusive Halo figures, collectibles and in-game
items. If you're a Halo fan, this has some

00:04:32.033 --> 00:04:35.709
exclusive stuff that comes through Loot Crate in
that specific crate. You can go to

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:40.789
lootcrate.com/LDNHalo to check it out. You can use
the code "LDNHalo," all one word, for a

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:46.374
discount to that. The cutoff for orders is
tonight, so if you plan to do that, you might want

00:04:46.374 --> 00:04:51.830
to check it out in the next couple of hours. Now's
your chance to do it, go. Do it, it's awesome.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:05:01.253
Right. That's our sponsorship. Couple of other
things to mention. We will be returning January

00:05:01.253 --> 00:05:08.175
5th, will be our returning episode in 2017. The
new year. We'll pick up wherever tonight leaves off.

00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:10.360
LIAM: Those characters are going to be awesome.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:18.079
MATT: You have so much faith in yourselves! It's
very possible. No. So yeah, we'll be back January

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:22.917
5th. We wish you guys a very very merry holiday,
in all your celebrations, and your families, and

00:05:22.917 --> 00:05:25.920
your New Year's, and all that crazy stuff. We'll
have more of that at the end of the episode, but

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.694
we'll see you back then. We have a merch
shout-out, actually. Laura, if you want to talk

00:05:31.694 --> 00:05:33.629
about what we have up on the store for them?

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:41.252
LAURA: That's a good question. I have no idea
what's in the store tonight. I have no sheet in

00:05:41.252 --> 00:05:45.257
front of me, and I have no idea what's there. I
think there's some hats left, I know there are

00:05:45.257 --> 00:05:46.355
some hats--

00:05:46.355 --> 00:05:47.743
TRAVIS: The dice got restocked.

00:05:47.743 --> 00:05:51.298
LAURA: No, they did not. No, the dice did not get
restocked, the dice are coming back in, like,

00:05:51.298 --> 00:05:56.995
January, so there's a lot more coming in January,
so that's good. I have no idea what else is in the

00:05:56.995 --> 00:05:59.144
store though. A hat? There's a hat.

00:05:59.144 --> 00:06:01.038
MATT: There you go.

00:06:01.038 --> 00:06:02.677
LAURA: Shit, I got nothing.

00:06:02.677 --> 00:06:04.340
SAM: You are the best.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:11.542
LAURA: You guys, I'm focused on spells, and I'm
focused on arrows, and hit points and-- (gasps)

00:06:11.542 --> 00:06:17.032
And the patches! And our mugs!

00:06:17.032 --> 00:06:21.908
MATT: If you go to the Geek and Sundry store under
Critical Role, you'll see merch! That's our

00:06:21.908 --> 00:06:25.021
announcement for the evening!

00:06:25.021 --> 00:06:33.654
LAURA: There's still patches left, you guys!
That's pretty cool! Yeah, the hats are still

00:06:33.654 --> 00:06:37.422
there. There's only a few left, though! There's
only a few hats left, I know that for sure.

00:06:37.422 --> 00:06:38.844
MARISHA: Only a few hats left.

00:06:38.844 --> 00:06:41.545
MARISHA and TALIESIN: And they're gone.

00:06:41.545 --> 00:06:43.871
LAURA: Sorry. I'm stressed!

00:06:43.871 --> 00:06:49.347
MARISHA: Yes, tomorrow we have a last-minute
special edition Signal Boost episode that is a

00:06:49.347 --> 00:06:55.095
stocking stuffer edition. Yeah, coming out
tomorrow, and it's got, like, coupons in it, so

00:06:55.095 --> 00:06:59.651
you should watch it. And also: everyone likes
coupons!

00:06:59.651 --> 00:07:01.510
TALIESIN: That's true.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:07.961
MARISHA: End of statement. Also, there was a
playlist that we put out that is a collection of

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:10.915
all of the artists that we have boosted over the
year.

00:07:10.915 --> 00:07:12.346
TALIESIN: Except one.

00:07:12.346 --> 00:07:17.196
MARISHA: Except for one because they're not on
Spotify and it's not my fault. But yeah, go check

00:07:17.196 --> 00:07:21.562
it out and I also wrote a little thing giving some
insight into the background of the show.

00:07:21.562 --> 00:07:24.357
MATT: It's a great write-up, I recommend you guys
check it out. Even if you haven't watched Signal

00:07:24.357 --> 00:07:27.555
Boost, it's a great write-up. I recommend it.
Thank you, Marisha.

00:07:27.555 --> 00:07:35.011
MARISHA: You're welcome. I'll be here all week.
Yeah, not really, it's Christmas time.

00:07:35.011 --> 00:07:41.537
MATT: This is a pretty cool announcement. After a
back and forth for the past year, we just got

00:07:41.537 --> 00:07:47.347
approval from Blizzard Entertainment to
incorporate their music from their game projects

00:07:47.347 --> 00:07:48.920
into our Critical Role soundtrack.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.212
SAM: For the final fight?

00:07:50.212 --> 00:07:54.003
MATT: I've incorporated a few tracks for tonight's
battle, as well as a couple of community-made

00:07:54.003 --> 00:07:59.246
tracks that have been submitted over time, so
we'll have some fresh tracks for the evening. But,

00:07:59.246 --> 00:08:02.935
Blizzard, thank you so much, thank you to Woody
Day, and a bunch of the guys who have helped out

00:08:02.935 --> 00:08:06.639
over there to make this happen. We're excited to
include those amazing soundtracks into our

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:09.954
atmospheric background tracks in future episodes.

00:08:09.954 --> 00:08:16.290
LIAM: I was not prepared. Oh! I'm fired, aren't
I?

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.392
MATT: Yeah, you are. Anything else anyone wants to
mention real fast?

00:08:20.392 --> 00:08:21.830
BRIAN: (distantly) Critmas!

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.783
MATT: Oh yes. (laughing) Thank you, disembodied
voice of Brian Wayne Foster, ghost of Christmas

00:08:26.783 --> 00:08:33.634
Tuesday. Next Tuesday we have a special Critmas
episode of Talks Machina. A bunch of us are

00:08:33.634 --> 00:08:38.233
opening your awesome Critmas presents, and we'll
be showing the videos the community submitted

00:08:38.233 --> 00:08:43.101
about what Critical Role means to them, to you,
and to us! So check it out next Tuesday in the

00:08:43.101 --> 00:08:54.078
usual spot. I think that's it. All right, cool!
Then let us go ahead and bring the tension up as

00:08:54.078 --> 00:09:01.990
you guys wander into the flaming core of Emon to
show down with Thordak, the Cinder King, on

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.491
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:09:05.491 --> 00:10:37.391
[dramatic music]

00:10:37.391 --> 00:10:46.456
MATT: Welcome back. So! Last we left off, Vox
Machina, after spending the better part of a

00:10:46.456 --> 00:10:51.721
number of months traversing the Prime Material
Plane and planes beyond in search of ancient

00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:57.382
relics known as the Vestiges of Divergence, they
finally increased their abilities, they've made

00:10:57.382 --> 00:11:04.377
allies, and they've begun their trek to tear down
the collection of evil chromatic dragons known as

00:11:04.377 --> 00:11:09.603
the Chroma Conclave that destroyed your city of
Emon and took over most of the continent of

00:11:09.603 --> 00:11:17.855
Tal'Dorei and beyond. You've defeated and you've
slain three members of the Conclave, allied with a

00:11:17.855 --> 00:11:23.673
fourth, and you've made your way, along with an
army combined with the powers of Fort Daxio and

00:11:23.673 --> 00:11:31.476
Syngorn, to the central city of Emon. Utilizing
aid from the Ashari people to cover the skies as

00:11:31.476 --> 00:11:42.265
the armies began to assault the outer walls, you,
along with Zahra, Kashaw, Jarett, Gilmore, the

00:11:42.265 --> 00:11:44.360
whole party, everyone's there, Kima--

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.814
TRAVIS: Britney Spears, NSYNC--

00:11:45.814 --> 00:11:47.277
SAM: My other brother.

00:11:47.277 --> 00:11:54.232
MATT: Drake's staying back with the army to help
them with the assault. You guys made your way

00:11:54.232 --> 00:11:59.908
underneath through the sewer system, made a brief
alliance with some wayward Clasp who led you to

00:11:59.908 --> 00:12:05.702
the center of town where the volcanic essence of
Thordak's mutated draconic form has been pulling

00:12:05.702 --> 00:12:11.563
volcanic activity up beneath the city. You climbed
out on top and there, at the walled gates to the

00:12:11.563 --> 00:12:16.392
central Cloudtop District, which Thordak now calls
his home and his lair, you saw two fire giants

00:12:16.392 --> 00:12:23.716
guarding the entrance. Kashaw and Zahra, in a
heroic display, bound the giants to place and

00:12:23.716 --> 00:12:28.548
decided to take care of them while you rushed into
the fray, bursting through the door due to the

00:12:28.548 --> 00:12:38.588
strength of your Titanstone Gauntlets. You rushed
into the cloud, smoke, and ember-filled Cloudtop

00:12:38.588 --> 00:12:46.672
District ruins, jumping from ruined building to
wreck of rubble and stone. The air itself is dense

00:12:46.672 --> 00:12:52.276
and black with dark fume and it's hard to see
anything. You all carefully, gingerly, stealthily

00:12:52.276 --> 00:12:58.569
made your way into the alcove of one ruined
building, where across the way, you see a giant

00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:08.542
raised central cavern, a hole, a burrow, if you
will, that is close to 40 feet across. Apparently,

00:13:08.542 --> 00:13:15.213
your approach was somewhat sensed by the red
dragon himself, as you watch Thordak emerge from

00:13:15.213 --> 00:13:21.214
this burrow and climb out saying to itself, "It
appears we have visitors."

00:13:21.214 --> 00:13:23.823
(sound of liquid pouring)

00:13:23.823 --> 00:13:25.374
SAM: I'm really nervous.

00:13:25.374 --> 00:13:30.008
(laughter)

00:13:30.008 --> 00:13:36.707
MATT: So, as Ashley unfortunately can not be with
us, Pike's control and duty will be taken care of

00:13:36.707 --> 00:13:40.739
by the twins for the evening. You guys will be
dual cleric-ing tonight.

00:13:40.739 --> 00:13:42.060
LAURA: We're Jaegering.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:50.351
MATT: Indeed. At this point in time, you guys are
all keeping as still and as quiet as you can while

00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:58.815
figuring out your circumstances. You can hear the
low growling voice of Thordak as he begins to scan

00:13:58.815 --> 00:14:01.959
the vicinity. (growling)

00:14:01.959 --> 00:14:03.739
MARISHA: Potions! Potions!

00:14:03.739 --> 00:14:05.360
SAM: Oh, good idea, good idea.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.218
LAURA: I take fire resistance.

00:14:07.218 --> 00:14:09.914
MATT: Fire resistance? Fire resistance, fire
resistance--

00:14:09.914 --> 00:14:15.033
LIAM: Am I able to make a jello shot of
invulnerability and haste at the same time?

00:14:15.033 --> 00:14:25.317
LAURA: But you know they only last for one minute
each. Just wait for like a second. Just wait. Fire

00:14:25.317 --> 00:14:28.747
resistance lasts for a while, I passed them out,
so if you've got them, take them.

00:14:28.747 --> 00:14:38.534
MATT: Okay, so we have Scanlan, Keyleth, Vex,
Grog, all with fire resistance? And Percy? All

00:14:38.534 --> 00:14:42.876
right. That's pretty much everyone but you, I
believe, right?

00:14:42.876 --> 00:14:44.364
LAURA: Oh, but he's got the armor--

00:14:44.364 --> 00:14:50.464
MATT: So yeah, the entire party, thank god, is set
to resist fire. That may help your chances here.

00:14:50.464 --> 00:14:55.856
As you all guys quietly begin to drink and figure
out your circumstances--

00:14:55.856 --> 00:15:00.976
TRAVIS: Why are you laughing? Why'd you laugh?

00:15:00.976 --> 00:15:05.962
MATT: Because I was rolling Thordak's perception
check to see if he noticed any of your presences

00:15:05.962 --> 00:15:08.566
as you were drinking the potions. I got a natural
one.

00:15:08.566 --> 00:15:12.535
LAURA: Wow, just drinking a potion would make him
notice us?

00:15:12.535 --> 00:15:15.042
LIAM: "I guess I'll go back to sleep now."

00:15:15.042 --> 00:15:27.356
MATT: He's still scanning, and he's still like, "We
can sense you here. Where are you?" And you hear

00:15:27.356 --> 00:15:30.449
(heavy footsteps).

00:15:30.449 --> 00:15:32.268
SAM: Should I cause a distraction?

00:15:32.268 --> 00:15:34.506
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.

00:15:34.506 --> 00:15:40.575
MATT: Okay. What are the components of that spell?
Let's take a look here.

00:15:40.575 --> 00:15:49.761
LAURA: It can't be vocal because it's Pass Without
a Trace-- oh no, it's verbal.

00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:50.876
MATT: Yep!

00:15:50.876 --> 00:15:54.113
LAURA: No, I don't do that! I don't know what
those things mean!

00:15:54.113 --> 00:15:57.019
TRAVIS: You better get your shit in gear.

00:15:57.019 --> 00:16:02.760
LAURA: It's a whisper. Tell me it's a one! Tell me
it's a one!

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.366
MATT: That was not a one.

00:16:04.366 --> 00:16:12.013
TRAVIS: I mean, let's be clear, what are we really
going to hide from? Look where his fucking head

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:17.999
is. He's like the sun. We ain't hiding from that
shit.

00:16:17.999 --> 00:16:20.726
LAURA: He may have heard us, but now we've got
plus ten stealth.

00:16:20.726 --> 00:16:32.501
MATT: So, as you guys are all quietly huddled over
in this broken space there, Vex'ahlia begins to do

00:16:32.501 --> 00:16:37.811
her incantation beneath her breath and as you feel
the shadows cling to you, you hear in the

00:16:37.811 --> 00:16:43.624
distance, "Ah. There you are."

00:16:43.624 --> 00:16:45.772
TRAVIS: I just want to pee on myself and run.

00:16:45.772 --> 00:16:53.567
MATT: He has currently moved out to this area, and
began to asses the scenery. I need all of you to

00:16:53.567 --> 00:16:55.675
roll initiative.

00:16:55.675 --> 00:16:58.489
(screaming)

00:16:58.489 --> 00:17:01.250
LAURA: Already!? Take your potions!

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.826
LIAM: I can't, we're into initiative, right? It's
too late for potions.

00:17:03.826 --> 00:17:10.502
MATT: You took your fire resistance potions.
That's all you had time to do.

00:17:10.502 --> 00:17:12.172
MARISHA: That's not too bad, not too bad.

00:17:12.172 --> 00:17:13.768
TALIESIN: That will do.

00:17:13.768 --> 00:17:16.628
LAURA: Who's rolling for Pike?

00:17:16.628 --> 00:17:21.109
LIAM: I'll do it. I got 11, plus what?

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:22.639
LAURA: I don't think she has anything, so--

00:17:22.639 --> 00:17:24.913
MATT: Pike has no bonus.

00:17:24.913 --> 00:17:29.575
TRAVIS: 14. Oh wait, you ask them, in order.

00:17:29.575 --> 00:17:34.411
LAURA: I'm freaking out, shit, I'm sorry, I
thought I was helping.

00:17:34.411 --> 00:17:38.419
MATT: Vex, what did you get?

00:17:38.419 --> 00:17:39.537
LAURA: 13.

00:17:39.537 --> 00:17:42.269
MATT: 13 for you? All right.

00:17:42.269 --> 00:17:46.071
LIAM: 12, and Pike got 11.

00:17:46.071 --> 00:17:48.582
TALIESIN: Pretty good for Pike.

00:17:48.582 --> 00:17:50.881
LAURA and MARISHA: That is pretty good for Pike.

00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:53.526
MATT: Keyleth?

00:17:53.526 --> 00:17:54.711
MARISHA: 17.

00:17:54.711 --> 00:17:56.222
LAURA: Good.

00:17:56.222 --> 00:17:58.581
MARISHA: Yeah, it's pretty good for Keyleth. Oh
god.

00:17:58.581 --> 00:17:59.396
MATT: Percy?

00:17:59.396 --> 00:18:03.670
TALIESIN: 25. Fast, fast.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:12.308
SAM: Eight. I'll be bringing up the rear. That's
how I like it anyway.

00:18:12.308 --> 00:18:17.632
LIAM: While we're cowering here, Pike says, "Guys,
I think I could really help you out if you wait a

00:18:17.632 --> 00:18:20.400
"second. Okay?"

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.504
LAURA: Oh, Pike didn't even get a chance to--

00:18:24.504 --> 00:18:29.192
TRAVIS: Were we supposed to have a Heroes' Feast?

00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:31.572
LAURA: We did, we did have a Heroes' Feast.

00:18:31.572 --> 00:18:33.640
TRAVIS: I'm so glad, I was totally here last
week.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.126
LAURA: We're all immune to fear and poison still,
we all have advantage on wisdom.

00:18:37.126 --> 00:18:39.288
MATT: You do indeed.

00:18:39.288 --> 00:18:41.879
TALIESIN: And extra hit points.

00:18:41.879 --> 00:18:51.958
MATT: All righty. So! With that, beginning of the
round, at the very top: Percival. You glance around the

00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:57.378
corner and you see sifting through the large
columns of smoke that are billowing off each one

00:18:57.378 --> 00:19:05.959
of these destroyed, burning buildings, you see the
gargantuan form of Thordak (heavy footsteps) and

00:19:05.959 --> 00:19:09.684
looks right over. You see all of a sudden as his
eyes pass in your direction, almost like a cat

00:19:09.684 --> 00:19:15.402
caught in a light beam, as his eyes flare up with
bright white light as it sees your presence.

00:19:15.402 --> 00:19:17.667
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:19:17.667 --> 00:19:19.327
TRAVIS: What do you see?

00:19:19.327 --> 00:19:25.454
TALIESIN: It's coming. Is there room, can I get
even vaguely a shot in that room?

00:19:25.454 --> 00:19:31.861
MATT: From here, at his size, you could get a shot
if you moved a little bit.

00:19:31.861 --> 00:19:33.163
TALIESIN: I'll move a little bit.

00:19:33.163 --> 00:19:35.631
MATT: Jump between these folks there.

00:19:35.631 --> 00:19:39.772
TALIESIN: I have Spider Climb on right now, so
actually I'll climb up on the wall and then climb

00:19:39.772 --> 00:19:41.351
back down when I'm done.

00:19:41.351 --> 00:19:42.352
MATT: Okay.

00:19:42.352 --> 00:19:52.018
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- Ignore that, I've been
drinking. First of all, I'm going to cast Hex on

00:19:52.018 --> 00:19:55.162
him. Because that's really going to make a
difference.

00:19:55.162 --> 00:19:56.862
TRAVIS: No, it is! Stay positive!

00:19:56.862 --> 00:20:01.623
TALIESIN: What kind of checks should I-- I'm going
to down him for--

00:20:01.623 --> 00:20:04.462
MARISHA: I feel like he's real good at
everything.

00:20:04.462 --> 00:20:06.366
LAURA: Like, wisdom, or something.

00:20:06.366 --> 00:20:19.226
TALIESIN: I'm going to give him a disadvantage on
dexterity checks. Because fuck it. All right, I'm

00:20:19.226 --> 00:20:24.028
going to take out Bad News, and I'm going to take
two shots, which is my way, with Hex and Bad News,

00:20:24.028 --> 00:20:36.147
and hopefully everything's going to go just fine. I'm
going to use Sharpshooter, and I'm going to use

00:20:36.147 --> 00:20:44.567
Deadeye on the first one. I'm going to drop a
point on Deadeye. So, Deadeye roll-- That should

00:20:44.567 --> 00:21:01.845
have counted, damn it, I shouldn't have picked it
up. Oh, thank god. That's-- sorry, I'm blanking.

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:05.154
26 to hit.

00:21:05.154 --> 00:21:06.503
MATT: That hits.

00:21:06.503 --> 00:21:08.051
TRAVIS: That's a good sign.

00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:16.623
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's not start saying that now.
And that's-- wow, I'm nervous!

00:21:16.623 --> 00:21:20.311
SAM: Wow!

00:21:20.311 --> 00:21:35.148
TALIESIN: That's actually really good. First shot
is 21, 37 points of damage plus five points of

00:21:35.148 --> 00:21:38.077
necrotic damage.

00:21:38.077 --> 00:21:40.454
MATT: In addition to 37? That's nice.

00:21:40.454 --> 00:21:43.632
TALIESIN: That's really nice. I rolled really
high, and I have Sharpshooter running.

00:21:43.632 --> 00:21:44.820
MATT: Good opening shot.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:58.912
TALIESIN: Next one, I'm going to shoot
Sharpshooter, but no Deadshot. Is an 18 to hit?

00:21:58.912 --> 00:21:59.674
MATT: Nope.

00:21:59.674 --> 00:22:04.578
TALIESIN: Okay, second one misses. I'm going to
crawl back and hide again and get a little bit

00:22:04.578 --> 00:22:08.057
of-- yeah, I got up on top, took two shots, and
crawled back down to hide.

00:22:08.057 --> 00:22:12.809
MATT: All right, as you climb up to the top, you
slam Bad News over the top of the stonework, and

00:22:12.809 --> 00:22:16.504
as soon as the barrel catches a little bit of the
light through the smoke, you watch as Thordak's

00:22:16.504 --> 00:22:21.854
face whips over in your direction. (gunshot) The
first shot smashes across the crest on the front

00:22:21.854 --> 00:22:27.905
of the dragon's face. You see sparks fly, and bits
of flame, red crystal get shattered in the

00:22:27.905 --> 00:22:32.103
distance. The head spins back towards you, and
immediately you start shaking, and you fire the

00:22:32.103 --> 00:22:38.208
second shot and it ricochets off of its angry,
thick hide. You immediately duck back behind the wall.

00:22:38.208 --> 00:22:49.191
TALIESIN: I'm regretting so many things right now!
Not you! Oh god! I shouldn't avoid my family. It

00:22:49.191 --> 00:22:50.665
leads to dragons.

00:22:50.665 --> 00:22:56.252
MATT: In all of your focus, and all of your
attention into the arrival, and the crawl into

00:22:56.252 --> 00:23:00.752
this, and Thordak, none of you noticed that Larkin
is not with you.

00:23:00.752 --> 00:23:03.032
LAURA: No surprise there.

00:23:03.032 --> 00:23:04.255
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

00:23:04.255 --> 00:23:05.356
LAURA: Piece of shit.

00:23:05.356 --> 00:23:14.136
MARISHA: Piece of shit. Okay, I don't know what to
do here? What are we trying to do? Do we have a

00:23:14.136 --> 00:23:17.243
plan? Should I try and burn a big spell?

00:23:17.243 --> 00:23:23.142
SAM: Do whatever you do! We've been practicing for
this our whole lives.

00:23:23.142 --> 00:23:32.738
MARISHA: Okay, before I do something crazy, based
off of Percy saying that, I turn to Vex and I go,

00:23:32.738 --> 00:23:36.940
by the way, I've been meaning to ask you about
that, if he ever followed through, so stay alive,

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:44.947
we can talk later! Okay! And I pop over the corner
and I'm going to cast Tsunami?

00:23:44.947 --> 00:23:47.656
SAM: I've never heard you say those words.

00:23:47.656 --> 00:23:49.653
LIAM: No, it's not.

00:23:49.653 --> 00:23:52.088
MATT: So you're casting Tsunami.

00:23:52.088 --> 00:23:54.446
LIAM: She did this once and wrecked our enemies.

00:23:54.446 --> 00:24:00.775
MARISHA: That was Tidal Wave, this is like a big
daddy version of that.

00:24:00.775 --> 00:24:02.319
LIAM: It's worse than that?

00:24:02.319 --> 00:24:12.831
MARISHA: This is my 8th-level spell. So I create a
wall 300 feet high, 300 feet long, and 50 feet

00:24:12.831 --> 00:24:14.478
thick of water.

00:24:14.478 --> 00:24:23.008
MATT: You watch as the smoke is instantly replaced
with steam in the vicinity, completely filling the

00:24:23.008 --> 00:24:29.223
area with fog, as this giant wall of water is
conjured out of the broken, cracked, dry earth and

00:24:29.223 --> 00:24:40.212
begins curling over towards Thordak's front side.
All right, so, strength saving throw-- Wait, any

00:24:40.212 --> 00:24:41.696
Huge or smaller creature.

00:24:41.696 --> 00:24:45.994
LAURA: Is he bigger than Huge?

00:24:45.994 --> 00:24:48.485
MATT: He is bigger than Huge.

00:24:48.485 --> 00:24:53.536
LAURA: So it doesn't have any effect on him? Is he
bigger than 300 feet?

00:24:53.536 --> 00:24:55.716
MARISHA: Yeah, he's not bigger than 300 feet, is
he?

00:24:55.716 --> 00:25:03.907
MATT: It's big, but the sheer mass size-- You
watch as the tidal wave smashes into Thordak and

00:25:03.907 --> 00:25:07.654
splits and falls around him, no effect. His form
is too big--

00:25:07.654 --> 00:25:08.861
MARISHA: None at all?

00:25:08.861 --> 00:25:13.193
MATT: The water crashes against him, he's too big
for it to actually have an impact on him.

00:25:13.193 --> 00:25:16.013
LIAM: Are there any fires left burning in the
vicinity?

00:25:16.013 --> 00:25:25.416
MATT: Actually, this fire is out now, this fire
goes out, and water spills down into the tunnel

00:25:25.416 --> 00:25:28.676
and you watch a bunch of steam (whoosh) rise out
of it.

00:25:28.676 --> 00:25:33.268
MARISHA: Well, it's also a six-round spell, and
he's supposed to get stuck in it. Nothing? No.

00:25:33.268 --> 00:25:34.329
MATT: He's too big.

00:25:34.329 --> 00:25:35.996
LAURA: He doesn't even get damaged at all,
though?

00:25:35.996 --> 00:25:39.770
TRAVIS: Does he question his choices in life?

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:42.009
MARISHA: Because I'm questioning mine.

00:25:42.009 --> 00:25:46.676
MATT: It says any Huge or smaller creature inside
the wall has to make a saving throw or take

00:25:46.676 --> 00:25:53.205
damage, creature caught in the wall can move, but
yeah, it only seems to have an effect on--

00:25:53.205 --> 00:25:57.036
SAM: Well, that was a valiant effort.

00:25:57.036 --> 00:26:00.605
MATT: I was with you. But, hey, 8th-level spell!

00:26:00.605 --> 00:26:03.335
SAM: You got tons of 8th-level spells, you'll be
fine.

00:26:03.335 --> 00:26:07.325
MARISHA: "But, hey, 8th-level spell?" Did you just
say that to me?

00:26:07.325 --> 00:26:09.940
MATT: Sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.872
MARISHA: Holy fuck.

00:26:13.872 --> 00:26:16.746
SAM: No problem.

00:26:16.746 --> 00:26:19.065
TALIESIN: I would get back behind the wall if I
were you.

00:26:19.065 --> 00:26:22.664
MATT: So Keyleth, do you want to use the rest of
your movement?

00:26:22.664 --> 00:26:25.199
SAM: Don't get back behind the fucking wall, don't
get back behind the wall, we're all bunched up. Go

00:26:25.199 --> 00:26:26.487
somewhere else.

00:26:26.487 --> 00:26:27.816
TRAVIS: Scatter.

00:26:27.816 --> 00:26:31.707
LAURA: I know how painful this is right now,
Keyleth, but it looked really cool. Just run.

00:26:31.707 --> 00:26:35.817
LIAM: Our pores are cleared-- the steam--

00:26:35.817 --> 00:26:41.080
TALIESIN: The wall will at least take some damage
at this point, most things he's going to do are

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.086
going to be a giant area effect anyway that you're
not going to be able to outrun, you might as well

00:26:44.086 --> 00:26:45.040
have cover--

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.312
MATT: Oh, wait, hold on--

00:26:46.312 --> 00:26:48.890
SAM: Judges weighing in.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:53.753
MATT: Sorry, I scrolled past that part there--
Each creature has to make a saving throw, so it

00:26:53.753 --> 00:26:56.598
does affect him the first round. It does.

00:26:56.598 --> 00:26:58.447
MARISHA: Just on the first round, though?

00:26:58.447 --> 00:27:00.586
LAURA: Still, that's something!

00:27:00.586 --> 00:27:03.903
MATT: Each turn after that-- so, yeah, basically
as it gets smaller it affects less and less

00:27:03.903 --> 00:27:05.954
creatures. Sorry, I scrolled past that one.

00:27:05.954 --> 00:27:08.964
MARISHA: So it just doesn't keep him restrained?

00:27:08.964 --> 00:27:16.914
MATT: That is a 21.

00:27:16.914 --> 00:27:19.979
SAM: What's your spell DC?

00:27:19.979 --> 00:27:21.365
MARISHA: 20.

00:27:21.365 --> 00:27:26.580
MATT: So it takes half-- so roll 6d10 and it takes
half damage.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:27.848
SAM: Oh, that's something!

00:27:27.848 --> 00:27:30.087
LAURA: That's better than zero!

00:27:30.087 --> 00:27:36.685
MARISHA: It's better than-- yay, 8th-level spell,
to quote Matt Mercer.

00:27:36.685 --> 00:27:42.491
TALIESIN: That will be our next t-shirt, "Yay,
8th-level spell."

00:27:42.491 --> 00:27:50.348
MATT: It's fine. keep digging. This is my battle
against you guys.

00:27:50.348 --> 00:27:51.770
MARISHA: I'm not digging!

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:54.181
LAURA: No, no, not at all! We're very happy with
that!

00:27:54.181 --> 00:28:02.506
MARISHA: 26, 35, halved.

00:28:02.506 --> 00:28:04.950
MATT: Okay, half of the 35--

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.491
MARISHA: But it's not going to do anything to him
on subsequent rounds?

00:28:07.491 --> 00:28:09.990
SAM: 17 points, that's something!

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.536
LAURA: Is there water all over the ground,
though?

00:28:12.536 --> 00:28:15.059
MATT: It says here that at the start of each of
your turns after the wall appears, the wall along

00:28:15.059 --> 00:28:20.616
with any creatures in it move 50 feet away from
you. So it will move him 50 feet back, unless he

00:28:20.616 --> 00:28:21.952
gets out of it.

00:28:21.952 --> 00:28:28.052
MARISHA: Yeah, it says any Huge or smaller
creatures must make a strength saving throw in

00:28:28.052 --> 00:28:29.625
order to move.

00:28:29.625 --> 00:28:33.210
MATT: Correct. He can move through it fine, he's
too big now, he doesn't take the additional damage

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:34.696
in following rounds.

00:28:34.696 --> 00:28:39.153
MARISHA: So he gets to move out of it no problem?
Is that essentially the deal?

00:28:39.153 --> 00:28:41.219
TALIESIN: But he is picked up for 50 feet, though.

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:43.082
MARISHA: Yeah, but is he moved back?

00:28:43.082 --> 00:28:49.513
MATT: It still has to try and make an athletics
check against your spell DC to move at all, but it

00:28:49.513 --> 00:28:51.504
doesn't take any additional damage.

00:28:51.504 --> 00:28:53.106
MARISHA: All right, I'll take that.

00:28:53.106 --> 00:28:57.156
MATT: It's her first time using this spell, guys,
so be patient, we're figuring this out as we go.

00:28:57.156 --> 00:29:05.545
TALIESIN: I would say also just because Pike was
going to do a thing, so come back for Pike's thing

00:29:05.545 --> 00:29:07.007
that she was going to do.

00:29:07.007 --> 00:29:08.580
MARISHA: Pike's going to do a thing?

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.037
LIAM: So is he.

00:29:10.037 --> 00:29:14.156
LAURA: I feel like, run, Marisha, 'cause the thing that
Pike's going to do is--

00:29:14.156 --> 00:29:17.197
MARISHA: Is that an AOE thing that she's going to
do?

00:29:17.197 --> 00:29:18.474
LAURA: Yeah, but just go.

00:29:18.474 --> 00:29:24.817
MARISHA: All right, here's what I'm going to do,
I'm going to move in this area over here. Kind of

00:29:24.817 --> 00:29:26.930
poke into this building?

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:31.748
MATT: That's as far as you can get with your full
movement.

00:29:31.748 --> 00:29:37.057
MARISHA: No, no, I don't want to go that way, I
want to go behind-- sorry, this isn't very--

00:29:37.057 --> 00:29:38.286
MATT: Over here?

00:29:38.286 --> 00:29:44.598
MARISHA: Yes, that way. Thank you.

00:29:44.598 --> 00:29:47.417
MATT: That right there is as far as you can get with your
full movement.

00:29:47.417 --> 00:29:49.532
MARISHA: Yeah, sure. Yeah.

00:29:49.532 --> 00:29:51.189
SAM: It's going to be great.

00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:54.081
MARISHA: It's going to be so great, it's going to
be great.

00:29:54.081 --> 00:30:05.568
MATT: All right, that ends Keyleth's turn. Jarett
is going to go ahead and rush around here. Pulling

00:30:05.568 --> 00:30:10.115
out his heavy crossbow, he's going to go ahead, as
he runs past, releasing a bolt towards Thordak--

00:30:10.115 --> 00:30:18.567
two bolts, actually, that is a-- nope, that
misses. That also misses. Well, they both hit, but

00:30:18.567 --> 00:30:22.366
they both splinter across his hide. All right,
Jarett's going to make the full move behind this

00:30:22.366 --> 00:30:28.683
wall and begin loading another bolt. "It's all
right, we got this!"

00:30:28.683 --> 00:30:30.890
SAM: He's dead.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.676
MATT: It is now Gilmore's turn.

00:30:33.676 --> 00:30:36.375
SAM: Shaun Gilmore!

00:30:36.375 --> 00:30:45.125
LAURA: I'm sorry. I don't know how I just stole two
pencils.

00:30:45.125 --> 00:30:46.436
LIAM: I do.

00:30:46.436 --> 00:30:56.221
MATT: Gilmore is going to-- As he watches Jarett
rush off and Keyleth rush back around the wall,

00:30:56.221 --> 00:31:02.645
watching the wall of water crash past the dragon,
goes, "All right. It's been a while since I've had

00:31:02.645 --> 00:31:09.427
"to do this." And he points his finger up towards
the dragon's head, and you watch as this green

00:31:09.427 --> 00:31:16.311
spark shoots this single green beam in the
direction of the dragon's face.

00:31:16.311 --> 00:31:18.580
TRAVIS: Please hit his face. Please hit his face.
Please hit his face.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.223
LAURA: Hit him, Gilmore!

00:31:20.223 --> 00:31:44.239
MATT: Let's see if it makes its dexterity saving
throw. That is-- yeah, he succeeds. Against the

00:31:44.239 --> 00:31:58.292
spell DC, yeah, he succeeds with a 19. He goes and
fires and you watch as Thordak sees the beam

00:31:58.292 --> 00:32:04.248
glimmer out of the fingers and he ducks down and
it fires past, dodging between the side of the

00:32:04.248 --> 00:32:07.035
head and the beam goes casting out that way, no
effect.

00:32:07.035 --> 00:32:08.453
TRAVIS: Shit hammer.

00:32:08.453 --> 00:32:10.928
LAURA: What level spell was that, Gilmore?

00:32:10.928 --> 00:32:12.699
MATT: "6th."

00:32:12.699 --> 00:32:16.877
MARISHA: I look at him and I go, yeah, 8th, I feel
you, man.

00:32:16.877 --> 00:32:20.224
MATT: "It's okay, we've got this."

00:32:20.224 --> 00:32:22.429
MARISHA: Fucking sucks, bro, all right, let's do
this.

00:32:22.429 --> 00:32:24.129
MATT: And he's going to go ahead and--

00:32:24.129 --> 00:32:26.891
LIAM: I don't understand all this arcane
terminology.

00:32:26.891 --> 00:32:34.203
MATT: "Scatter, right?" He pushes past and goes
running this way. All right, that's going to end

00:32:34.203 --> 00:32:36.339
his turn. Grog!

00:32:36.339 --> 00:32:41.882
TRAVIS: Yeah, I see Gilmore take off running, and
being there's a giant T-Rex on the map, I'm going

00:32:41.882 --> 00:32:47.339
to go, "Must go faster, must go faster--" And I
would like to run as fast as balls this way

00:32:47.339 --> 00:32:49.924
towards this cover as far as I can for 50 feet.

00:32:49.924 --> 00:32:54.058
MATT: Okay. You get right about there, as Thordak
has the same initiative as you.

00:32:54.058 --> 00:32:55.384
TRAVIS: Oh!

00:32:55.384 --> 00:33:01.433
MATT: Thordak, who has dodged the beam, and is
seeing the ants begin to scatter in front, goes,

00:33:01.433 --> 00:33:04.616
"Moving targets--"

00:33:04.616 --> 00:33:05.996
TRAVIS: Glad I joined Gilmore!

00:33:05.996 --> 00:33:09.418
MATT: "We love moving targets." And he's going to
step forward--

00:33:09.418 --> 00:33:11.732
LAURA: No! Don't move!

00:33:11.732 --> 00:33:24.849
MATT: --and is going to rear back and (inhales)
(whoosh) and unleash Flame Breath.

00:33:24.849 --> 00:33:28.517
SAM: Oh, Kiki, you're okay!

00:33:28.517 --> 00:33:30.425
LAURA: You made it!

00:33:30.425 --> 00:33:41.515
MATT: I need Vex, Percy, Vax, Pike, Scanlan,
Trinket, Grog, and Gilmore to all make dexterity

00:33:41.515 --> 00:33:44.612
saving throws. Hold on to that number.

00:33:44.612 --> 00:33:47.025
TALIESIN: Does partial cover help at all?

00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:49.898
MATT: No. The flame is like napalm.

00:33:49.898 --> 00:33:53.290
TALIESIN: I'm rerolling that.

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:58.594
MATT: Kima fails. Gilmore rolls a one! Are you
serious?

00:33:58.594 --> 00:34:01.127
LAURA: Did you roll for Pike?

00:34:01.127 --> 00:34:06.794
TALIESIN: That's a little better.

00:34:06.794 --> 00:34:10.619
SAM: Can I Cutting Words to do anything?

00:34:10.619 --> 00:34:12.337
TRAVIS: The Ancient Dragon?

00:34:12.337 --> 00:34:14.643
MATT: Cutting Words actually can reduce the
damage.

00:34:14.643 --> 00:34:17.576
SAM: Just the damage, not his attack?

00:34:17.576 --> 00:34:19.975
TRAVIS: We'll take the damage reduction.

00:34:19.975 --> 00:34:22.961
SAM: Will it reduce the damage for everybody?

00:34:22.961 --> 00:34:25.053
MATT: I'm double-checking that. I'm pretty sure it
does.

00:34:25.053 --> 00:34:27.019
SAM: If so, I will do that.

00:34:27.019 --> 00:34:29.424
TALIESIN: I just had to use a Resolve.

00:34:29.424 --> 00:34:32.359
LAURA: What did you roll?

00:34:32.359 --> 00:34:36.479
TALIESIN: A one. So I had to burn a Resolve, which
I have done.

00:34:36.479 --> 00:34:39.083
MATT: Yeah, so you can reduce the damage by a
certain amount for everybody.

00:34:39.083 --> 00:34:40.696
SAM: It won't be much, but I'll do it.

00:34:40.696 --> 00:34:42.182
TALIESIN: It'll help.

00:34:42.182 --> 00:34:47.410
LAURA: And then he's got disadvantage on something
next, doesn't he? After you use Cutting Words?

00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:48.969
MATT and SAM: Yes.

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:50.925
MATT: All right, so--

00:34:50.925 --> 00:35:00.835
SAM: So as he goes, I will yell at him, oi! What
sexual position makes the ugliest children? I

00:35:00.835 --> 00:35:02.566
don't know, ask your mama!

00:35:02.566 --> 00:35:07.384
(laughter)

00:35:07.384 --> 00:35:14.127
MATT: Wow. That's a thing.

00:35:14.127 --> 00:35:18.160
LIAM: I like to think of all of Vox Machina
nervously laughing.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:30.438
MATT: She has advantage on her saving throw-- Kima
does make her saving throw! All right, so! Go

00:35:30.438 --> 00:35:32.925
ahead and roll your d12 and it will reduce the
damage.

00:35:32.925 --> 00:35:35.125
SAM: Guys, you can reduce that damage by five.

00:35:35.125 --> 00:35:36.466
LAURA: Sweet.

00:35:36.466 --> 00:35:38.582
SAM: So instead of 150, it's 145.

00:35:38.582 --> 00:35:41.635
MATT: No, instead of 99 points of fire damage, it
is 94.

00:35:41.635 --> 00:35:43.329
SAM: 94!

00:35:43.329 --> 00:35:46.718
MATT: 94 points of fire damage.

00:35:46.718 --> 00:35:49.725
LAURA: 9d4?

00:35:49.725 --> 00:35:51.288
MATT: It was 99, now it's 94.

00:35:51.288 --> 00:35:55.019
TALIESIN: Does the five get subtracted before we
halve it, or after?

00:35:55.019 --> 00:35:57.874
MATT: It reduces the damage of the attack.

00:35:57.874 --> 00:36:02.356
LAURA: And then if we have fire resistance, then
it-- But what if we rolled 28, did we make our save?

00:36:02.356 --> 00:36:04.665
MATT: Grog, what was your--?

00:36:04.665 --> 00:36:05.897
TRAVIS: 17.

00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:06.902
MATT: Nope.

00:36:06.902 --> 00:36:07.713
LAURA: 28?

00:36:07.713 --> 00:36:08.509
MATT: Yes.

00:36:08.509 --> 00:36:09.308
LIAM: 24.

00:36:09.308 --> 00:36:10.764
MATT: 24--

00:36:10.764 --> 00:36:13.095
SAM: Oh shit. He has to look?

00:36:13.095 --> 00:36:14.336
MATT: You just make it.

00:36:14.336 --> 00:36:17.351
TALIESIN: 24 is a "just made it?"

00:36:17.351 --> 00:36:19.210
LIAM: So I take zero, because I'm using Evasion.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:20.670
MATT: Yes you do.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:22.714
MARISHA: I didn't have to roll.

00:36:22.714 --> 00:36:24.198
TALIESIN: 18.

00:36:24.198 --> 00:36:25.409
MATT: 18, nope.

00:36:25.409 --> 00:36:26.361
SAM: 21.

00:36:26.361 --> 00:36:27.417
MATT: 21, nope.

00:36:27.417 --> 00:36:29.302
LAURA: And Trinket and Pike both fail as well.

00:36:29.302 --> 00:36:37.363
MATT: Okay. Thankfully, that's half damage. So
that would be, at half of 94, 37-- I'm sorry, no,

00:36:37.363 --> 00:36:48.337
47. 47 points of fire damage to Grog, to Percy, to
Scanlan--

00:36:48.337 --> 00:36:50.107
LAURA: Pike and Trinket.

00:36:50.107 --> 00:36:51.828
MATT: Well, Trinket does not take half.

00:36:51.828 --> 00:36:54.907
SAM: Wait, I thought you said I didn't save.

00:36:54.907 --> 00:36:59.075
LAURA: Takes the full 90-- Trinket is in my
necklace. Again, already.

00:36:59.075 --> 00:37:01.513
MATT: Trinket goes right into your necklace.

00:37:01.513 --> 00:37:05.960
SAM: Wait, wait, so I get 94 or 47?

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:12.043
MATT: You didn't succeed, so you would take 94,
but because you have fire resistance, you take 47.

00:37:12.043 --> 00:37:14.189
SAM: Oh, okay! That's not bad!

00:37:14.189 --> 00:37:18.911
MATT: You take half of 47, because you have fire
resistance and you made the save.

00:37:18.911 --> 00:37:21.345
LAURA: So 23. 24.

00:37:21.345 --> 00:37:25.043
TRAVIS: Tell me he has only one of those per day.

00:37:25.043 --> 00:37:26.881
MATT: Nope, that regenerates.

00:37:26.881 --> 00:37:28.091
LAURA: 23 or 24?

00:37:28.091 --> 00:37:29.058
MATT: It would be 23.

00:37:29.058 --> 00:37:35.401
SAM: And Matthew DM, do our temporary hit points
go away first? Or last?

00:37:35.401 --> 00:37:39.659
TALIESIN: They're technically not temporary, it's
actually your max increases, so they can come back.

00:37:39.659 --> 00:37:41.302
MATT: Correct, they can come back, yeah.

00:37:41.302 --> 00:37:42.893
TALIESIN: You can heal into them.

00:37:42.893 --> 00:37:44.496
TRAVIS: Did somebody get temporary hit points?

00:37:44.496 --> 00:37:45.863
SAM: We all did.

00:37:45.863 --> 00:37:47.581
17, from our feast.

00:37:47.581 --> 00:37:51.026
LAURA: Oh, that's right, Pike has-- I need to--

00:37:51.026 --> 00:37:54.114
TALIESIN: You're 17 up. You can go 17 up even if
you lose them.

00:37:54.114 --> 00:37:57.064
TRAVIS: Right, well I'm going to add them now.

00:37:57.064 --> 00:37:59.183
TALIESIN: Your max is now much higher.

00:37:59.183 --> 00:38:03.972
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you, that's much better.

00:38:03.972 --> 00:38:10.850
MATT: Okay. Kima's doing okay, but Gilmore is
looking rough. As the flames burn through, hyper

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:17.465
white, red, orange, blazing fire, you haven't felt
heat like this before. You instinctively close

00:38:17.465 --> 00:38:21.835
your eyes, but it doesn't seem to help. As the
flames pass by you, Keyleth, you can even feel the

00:38:21.835 --> 00:38:26.194
impact from here, singeing your eyebrows, and you
have to cover your face for fear of being

00:38:26.194 --> 00:38:32.453
disfigured by the proximity. As the fire
eventually burns away, Gilmore is like stumbling

00:38:32.453 --> 00:38:37.805
right now, burned all around. The rest of the
party is already smoking, bits of your outfits and

00:38:37.805 --> 00:38:47.017
edges of clothing are now actually curling up and
burning. That was bad. So that ends Thordak's go. Grog?

00:38:47.017 --> 00:38:52.714
TRAVIS: Well, being that my run was so rudely
interrupted by shit-chest over there, can I change

00:38:52.714 --> 00:38:57.604
course seeing that he's going to barf fire at all
of us and run straight at him in a rage?

00:38:57.604 --> 00:38:59.389
MATT: Yes, you may.

00:38:59.389 --> 00:39:05.604
TRAVIS: Yeah, can we go ahead and see how we do
here, and I will go Reckless Attack, Great Weapon Master.

00:39:05.604 --> 00:39:07.058
MATT: Sure.

00:39:07.058 --> 00:39:09.024
LAURA: Doesn't that mean he gets advantage on his
attacks against you?

00:39:09.024 --> 00:39:13.642
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, let's buy the ticket and
take the train, right? Who fucking knows. One!

00:39:13.642 --> 00:39:17.213
Better. 19.

00:39:17.213 --> 00:39:18.671
MATT: 19 misses.

00:39:18.671 --> 00:39:22.555
TRAVIS: Shit. Roll better. That's better.

00:39:22.555 --> 00:39:24.138
LAURA: He's so big, though!

00:39:24.138 --> 00:39:25.691
MATT: But his armor is hard.

00:39:25.691 --> 00:39:28.595
TRAVIS: That is a 25.

00:39:28.595 --> 00:39:31.608
MATT: 25 hits. So the second attack hits. Are you
doing--?

00:39:31.608 --> 00:39:33.556
TRAVIS: Reckless and Great Weapon.

00:39:33.556 --> 00:39:38.103
MATT: Right, but I mean are you doing your frenzy
for the third attack? Or are you going regular?

00:39:38.103 --> 00:39:40.212
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going frenzied!

00:39:40.212 --> 00:39:41.721
MATT: All right.

00:39:41.721 --> 00:39:46.794
TRAVIS: 21.

00:39:46.794 --> 00:39:49.712
MATT: 21 misses. But you did get a hit in.

00:39:49.712 --> 00:39:50.952
TRAVIS: I do.

00:39:50.952 --> 00:39:54.097
LAURA: Oh my god. What was the second attack?

00:39:54.097 --> 00:40:11.842
TRAVIS: 25. So somewhere between 21 and 25. Which
one is the d12? This one. 11. Two points of

00:40:11.842 --> 00:40:16.172
necrotic and 36 total.

00:40:16.172 --> 00:40:24.016
MATT: 36, nice! As the flames subside from the
dragon breath, the flames part and you see,

00:40:24.016 --> 00:40:30.810
rushing out, flames curling off the edges of the
fur, this angry raging goliath (yells) runs and

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:36.790
takes one swing. It skids across the scales of the
front of Thordak's chest, gleaning past the giant

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:45.752
scar in the center. No damage. Thordak (laughs).
You look up into the beaming star-like eyes and

00:40:45.752 --> 00:40:53.769
angrily (yells). This time, the axe sinks in and
the laughter stops. You see the slight twinge of

00:40:53.769 --> 00:40:59.417
pain in the right eye of the dragon as you pull
back for a third one, brings its claw up and

00:40:59.417 --> 00:41:04.923
swings down to try and crush you. As you swing for
your attack, you instinctually realize it's

00:41:04.923 --> 00:41:10.505
probably best to let this go and you duck out of
the way in time as the claw (slam) into the ground

00:41:10.505 --> 00:41:11.946
in front of you.

00:41:11.946 --> 00:41:21.219
TRAVIS: Yeah! Yeah! Fuck. That ends my turn.

00:41:21.219 --> 00:41:23.479
MATT: Vex! Your turn!

00:41:23.479 --> 00:41:29.360
LAURA: Cool! I click my Boots of Haste!

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:36.450
MATT: You feel, for the first time, the adrenaline
surge through you and you suddenly go, "My

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:41.338
"brother's been hoarding this this whole time?!"
Everything slows down around you ever so slightly,

00:41:41.338 --> 00:41:45.142
and for a second, your mind's racing faster than
it normally does.

00:41:45.142 --> 00:41:50.559
LAURA: With my full movement, can I get behind the
wall up where Keyleth was headed?

00:41:50.559 --> 00:41:52.352
MATT: You can move 60 feet.

00:41:52.352 --> 00:41:57.607
LAURA: I want to stop in a place where I can
attack before I finish my move.

00:41:57.607 --> 00:42:01.117
MATT: You'll go over there and as you're rushing
past, Keyleth--

00:42:01.117 --> 00:42:05.559
LIAM: As she rushes past, she hears: (slowly)
Those are just a loaner!

00:42:05.675 --> 00:42:23.093
LAURA: (slowly) Go fuck yourself! Okay. All right.
I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark. Then, for my

00:42:23.093 --> 00:42:26.314
first attack, I'm going to try a Bramble Shot.

00:42:26.314 --> 00:42:30.991
MATT: Percy, by the way, I need you to make a
concentration check. It's a constitution saving throw.

00:42:30.991 --> 00:42:33.681
LAURA: Yes! 30 on the first.

00:42:33.681 --> 00:42:35.156
MATT: That hits.

00:42:35.156 --> 00:42:36.994
TALIESIN: Ten.

00:42:36.994 --> 00:42:38.731
MATT: Your Hex fades.

00:42:38.731 --> 00:43:03.646
LAURA: I took the bracers off, right? Yes, I did.
Okay. 15 plus two lightning damage plus two sneak

00:43:03.646 --> 00:43:14.783
attack and a Hunter's Mark. Ooh! 12 plus 4d8 for
the Bramble Shot.

00:43:14.783 --> 00:43:19.746
MATT: Nice! So already at 29 damage plus--?

00:43:19.746 --> 00:43:29.634
LAURA: 15. No. 13. 17.

00:43:29.634 --> 00:43:41.337
MATT: Plus 17. All right! 46 points of damage on
the first strike! What's the DC on the strength

00:43:41.337 --> 00:43:42.599
saving throw?

00:43:42.599 --> 00:43:44.266
LAURA: Oh. 16.

00:43:44.266 --> 00:43:46.249
MATT: Yeah. He makes it.

00:43:46.249 --> 00:43:48.270
LAURA: That would have been amazing.

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:53.044
MATT: Ten plus 12. That would have been amazing.
As you run past and fire the first arrow, it sinks

00:43:53.044 --> 00:44:01.189
in and jams into the side of where the plates of
the chest armor meet the scar. As it hits, you

00:44:01.189 --> 00:44:05.428
watch it cause a spurt of dragon blood, knowing
exactly where the weak points of the armor are,

00:44:05.428 --> 00:44:07.201
being a person that studied dragons.

00:44:07.201 --> 00:44:12.574
LAURA: Oh! That's right! And an additional d6
because he's a dragon, right? 2d6?

00:44:12.574 --> 00:44:17.405
MATT: You should have the additional damage, I
think it was plus two damage against creatures

00:44:17.405 --> 00:44:18.455
that are--

00:44:18.455 --> 00:44:20.510
LAURA: Oh, just plus two.

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:24.370
TRAVIS: 2d20 of damage.

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:26.970
LAURA: I thought it was a d6. Sorry. You're right,
I think.

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:30.722
MATT: Do you want to go look it up?

00:44:30.722 --> 00:44:35.683
LAURA: No, it's fine. I'll look it up between. My
next attack, I want to try one of my poisoned

00:44:35.683 --> 00:44:36.729
arrows.

00:44:36.729 --> 00:44:42.061
MATT: You see the brambles extend out from the arrow
and the dragon leans forward, already focused on

00:44:42.132 --> 00:44:46.363
Grog as you're slamming him in the side. As his
body flexes, the brambles shatter.

00:44:46.363 --> 00:44:47.467
LAURA: 27!

00:44:47.467 --> 00:44:48.759
MATT: 27 hits.

00:44:48.759 --> 00:45:09.068
LAURA: Okay! 14 plus four lightning damage. Plus
Hunter's Mark is another four. What is the poison?

00:45:09.068 --> 00:45:10.913
Do I do anything for the poison?

00:45:10.913 --> 00:45:15.469
MATT I am going to go ahead and roll a
constitution saving throw for him. Which succeeds.

00:45:15.469 --> 00:45:21.522
So, yeah, he just resists the poison effects of
the arrows.

00:45:21.522 --> 00:45:25.850
LAURA: Okay, and then I'm going to do a third
attack, right? Because I am hasted.

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:27.491
MATT: Yep.

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:31.822
LAURA: And that hits too! That's 31!

00:45:31.822 --> 00:45:34.268
TRAVIS: Damn, girl.

00:45:34.268 --> 00:45:45.258
LAURA: 16 plus another four lightning damage! Plus
Hunter's Mark, plus two plus two, because he is a

00:45:45.258 --> 00:45:47.814
dragon. But I didn't do plus two on the second one
because I--

00:45:47.814 --> 00:45:51.682
MATT: So 24 damage that final strike. Nice! You
did almost 100 points of damage in a single round.

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:54.847
(cheering)

00:45:54.847 --> 00:46:00.982
LAURA: And then I finish my round of movement and I
keep running behind the building. Yeah. Right

00:46:00.982 --> 00:46:02.414
there. I know.

00:46:02.414 --> 00:46:08.941
MATT: As you rush past, looking up into the face
of the creature that you know for certain, seeing

00:46:08.941 --> 00:46:12.820
it there, that this is the creature that brought
your mother to her end and half the city of

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:17.433
Byroden to the south. And as that anger swells
into you and mixes with the surge of adrenaline in

00:46:17.433 --> 00:46:22.139
your body and you don't even feel the momentum,
your hands instinctively go through all training,

00:46:22.139 --> 00:46:26.823
all the years that have gone by, as each arrow
gets loosed, there is just kind of this fuzz, this

00:46:26.823 --> 00:46:33.591
kind of numbness, around as your hatred is focused
so clear on this dragon's head. And then the air

00:46:33.591 --> 00:46:39.626
rushes back into your lungs and you slam your back
into the wall, preparing for your next round. All

00:46:39.626 --> 00:46:43.626
right, that finishes Vex's go. Vax and Lady Kima
go at the same time. What do you want to do?

00:46:43.626 --> 00:46:46.308
LIAM: I am going to down the potion of healing
with a bonus action.

00:46:46.308 --> 00:46:47.903
MATT: Okay.

00:46:47.903 --> 00:46:50.467
LIAM: And then now I have two actions because of
the potion--

00:46:50.467 --> 00:46:51.970
MATT: The potion of healing?

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:58.596
LIAM: No, no. Haste. So that's bonus action, now I
have two actions? Because of the potion.

00:46:58.596 --> 00:46:59.919
MATT: Correct.

00:46:59.919 --> 00:47:02.432
LIAM: Second action's used to pump out the wings.

00:47:02.432 --> 00:47:05.357
MATT: Okay. Wings are up.

00:47:05.357 --> 00:47:14.952
LIAM: Then I am going to fly directly towards
Thordak's face to-- you don't need that-- to ten

00:47:14.952 --> 00:47:20.459
feet away from him to his face. you can just hold
it for a second, and cast Vow of Enmity at him.

00:47:20.459 --> 00:47:22.045
MATT: All righty.

00:47:22.045 --> 00:47:28.681
LIAM: And then I am going to barrel roll back,
fly, and land hard right down next to my sister

00:47:28.681 --> 00:47:30.109
where she's hiding.

00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:34.354
MATT: Okay. At a non-hasted fly speed.

00:47:34.354 --> 00:47:35.677
LIAM: 120, hasted.

00:47:35.677 --> 00:47:40.705
MATT: Oh, because you are hasted with the potion.
So yeah, not a problem. Land right next to your

00:47:40.705 --> 00:47:42.033
sister.

00:47:42.033 --> 00:47:46.720
SAM: So you prayed at him? Good job!

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:53.600
MATT: You swoop up, right in front, you cast the
Vow of Enmity.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.696
LIAM: He could have taken a swipe at me. I'm just
glad he didn't.

00:47:55.696 --> 00:48:01.255
MATT: Oh, but we are going to get there. As you
swoop up within ten feet of his face and cast the

00:48:01.255 --> 00:48:13.414
Vow, focusing on him, the dragon grins, and as you
pull out of his attack space, because he has a

00:48:13.414 --> 00:48:19.231
reach of 15 feet with his bite, he is going to take
a bite attack at you. That is a 32 to hit.

00:48:19.231 --> 00:48:21.283
LIAM: Can I Uncanny Dodge this?

00:48:21.283 --> 00:48:22.427
MATT: You can.

00:48:22.427 --> 00:48:24.008
LIAM: Yeah. I have to.

00:48:24.008 --> 00:48:26.261
TRAVIS: 32 to hit?

00:48:26.261 --> 00:48:27.948
LAURA: We're fucked.

00:48:27.948 --> 00:48:32.431
MATT: That's actually a bad roll. 17 points of
piercing damage plus--

00:48:32.431 --> 00:48:38.974
LIAM: I knew it was going to happen.

00:48:38.974 --> 00:48:43.346
MATT: Plus 16 points of fire damage reduced to
half.

00:48:43.346 --> 00:48:46.817
LIAM: No, 17 plus 16 total.

00:48:46.817 --> 00:48:49.311
MATT: Well, because you have fire resistance that
is reduced.

00:48:49.311 --> 00:48:53.244
LIAM: Okay. So eight and 17. 25.

00:48:53.244 --> 00:48:54.949
MATT: Yes, 25 points of damage to you.

00:48:54.949 --> 00:48:56.782
LIAM: Gives me advantage on every attack.

00:48:56.782 --> 00:48:58.230
LAURA: Oh, that's great.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:01.348
LIAM: I will get sneak attack on every attack
whether there's someone next to him or not.

00:49:01.348 --> 00:49:02.415
LAURA: That's good.

00:49:02.415 --> 00:49:04.334
TALIESIN: Good! That's really good.

00:49:04.334 --> 00:49:13.679
MATT: Kima is going to--

00:49:13.679 --> 00:49:19.063
SAM: Who that? Who that? Is that Kima?

00:49:19.063 --> 00:49:31.123
MATT: That's Kima. Kima can't do too much at this
distance, unfortunately. She is going to cast Aura

00:49:31.123 --> 00:49:33.115
of Vitality on herself.

00:49:33.115 --> 00:49:36.121
SAM: On herself?

00:49:36.121 --> 00:49:44.041
MATT: Correct. What that does is allows her to
heal people as a bonus action for as long as it

00:49:44.041 --> 00:49:54.678
lasts. Which is pretty damn helpful, right now.
Let me pull it up real fast. Let's see, Aura of

00:49:54.678 --> 00:50:02.994
Vitality. She can use a bonus action to cause a
creature in the aura, including herself, to regain

00:50:02.994 --> 00:50:07.423
hit points. She's doing okay. She looks over at
Gilmore, who's hurt on the ground, staggering over

00:50:07.423 --> 00:50:12.978
in flames. As she rushes up, casts the spell on
herself, holding her holy symbol of Bahamut to her

00:50:12.978 --> 00:50:19.758
chest, she looks up at the dragon. "Remember me?"
Without even losing her vision, she puts her hand

00:50:19.758 --> 00:50:24.432
out like this, and you watch as a beam of divine
energy streaks out, slams into Gilmore's side. He

00:50:24.432 --> 00:50:27.514
almost doubles over as it swirls around his body
and heals his wounds for 2d6.

00:50:27.514 --> 00:50:29.381
SAM: Okay.

00:50:29.381 --> 00:50:30.794
MATT: So he heals four hit points.

00:50:30.794 --> 00:50:35.668
SAM: He's looking better.

00:50:35.668 --> 00:50:40.196
MATT: All right, that is going to end Kima's turn.
Pike's turn.

00:50:40.196 --> 00:50:44.149
SAM: By committee.

00:50:44.149 --> 00:50:50.631
LAURA: Okay, we're going to move to the corner of
the building that she's standing in.

00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:55.722
LIAM: Inside. Squished into the corner.

00:50:55.722 --> 00:50:59.791
MATT: Okay. Ten feet of movement to get there.

00:50:59.791 --> 00:51:08.118
LAURA: Yes. She's going to, as a bonus action,
cast Spiritual Weapon. At fifth level.

00:51:08.167 --> 00:51:09.943
LIAM: Okay. I'll mark that off.

00:51:09.992 --> 00:51:11.359
TALIESIN: Go nuts with it, yeah.

00:51:11.359 --> 00:51:12.658
MATT: What else is she doing this round?

00:51:12.658 --> 00:51:15.945
LAURA: And then she's also going to cast Beacon of
Hope.

00:51:15.945 --> 00:51:19.698
MATT: Beacon of Hope is a 3rd-level spell. If you
are casting a 3rd-level or higher spell as an

00:51:19.698 --> 00:51:23.782
action, you can only do a 2nd-level spell as a
bonus action. So you can either do Beacon of Hope

00:51:23.782 --> 00:51:25.509
and then a 2nd-level Spiritual Weapon or--

00:51:25.509 --> 00:51:30.629
LAURA: So we should do Beacon of Hope and not do
Spiritual Weapon because we want to do a higher

00:51:30.629 --> 00:51:32.205
Spiritual Weapon later?

00:51:32.205 --> 00:51:37.157
LIAM: So anyone within 30 feet of her is getting
some nice things.

00:51:37.157 --> 00:51:41.870
LAURA: So anybody within 30 feet gets advantage on
wisdom, which you already have, but you get

00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:43.824
advantage on death saving throws as well.

00:51:43.824 --> 00:51:45.589
LIAM: And the best part--

00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:50.029
LAURA: --is any time you're healed, you're
automatically healed to the max possible amount.

00:51:50.029 --> 00:51:51.684
SAM: What do you mean any time you're healed?

00:51:51.684 --> 00:51:56.598
LIAM: When someone heals you, you don't roll. You
calculate the maximum amount you could possibly roll.

00:51:56.598 --> 00:51:58.068
LAURA: And that's what you're healed for.

00:51:58.068 --> 00:52:01.945
TALIESIN: So, if it's 3d4, you just get 12. That's
amazing!

00:52:01.945 --> 00:52:04.258
SAM: Do we get any healing from this as well?

00:52:04.258 --> 00:52:09.296
LAURA: No, this is a prep spell. This is something
that probably we should have done before Thordak

00:52:09.296 --> 00:52:10.635
started attacking us.

00:52:10.635 --> 00:52:12.391
SAM: Yeah, well, you're not Pike. You don't know.

00:52:12.391 --> 00:52:16.237
LIAM: So, DM. Who all gets that? Looks like Grog
is just out of reach of it?

00:52:16.237 --> 00:52:22.486
MATT: Within 30 feet of her? Grog is just out of
the radius. Gilmore, Kima.

00:52:22.486 --> 00:52:26.334
LAURA: Should we have run around the corner? If we
had run around the corner, would Grog get?

00:52:26.334 --> 00:52:34.434
MATT: If you run to there? Okay, yeah. That would
get Grog, Gilmore, Scanlan, Percy, Keyleth. It

00:52:34.434 --> 00:52:36.041
does not get either of you.

00:52:36.041 --> 00:52:39.562
LAURA: Well, that's fine.

00:52:39.562 --> 00:52:42.744
MARISHA: This looks bad, but I feel okay about
this.

00:52:42.744 --> 00:52:44.407
MATT: So that's your action?

00:52:44.407 --> 00:52:47.316
LAURA: And that gets Pike in that as well.

00:52:47.316 --> 00:52:49.213
SAM: You get a bonus action.

00:52:49.213 --> 00:52:50.715
LAURA: Bonus action?

00:52:50.715 --> 00:52:53.531
SAM: You can do a Healing Word.

00:52:53.531 --> 00:52:55.968
LAURA: Oh, that's right, Healing Word!

00:52:55.968 --> 00:52:57.338
MATT: You can do up to a level two.

00:52:57.338 --> 00:53:04.545
LAURA: Okay, so she should do a Healing Word. Is
Healing Word a level two?

00:53:04.545 --> 00:53:06.941
TALIESIN: You can do it at any level you like.

00:53:06.941 --> 00:53:10.212
LIAM: Percy needs it? Grog needs it?

00:53:10.212 --> 00:53:11.858
LAURA: Grog needs it?

00:53:11.858 --> 00:53:17.638
TRAVIS: Yeah. I took like 40 points of damage.

00:53:17.638 --> 00:53:21.876
LAURA: I feel like he's okay still, so Percy?

00:53:21.876 --> 00:53:23.793
TALIESIN: One of the two of us, I would say.

00:53:23.793 --> 00:53:25.151
MARISHA: I didn't get hit. I'm good.

00:53:25.151 --> 00:53:27.713
TALIESIN: Oh, I'll take it. How much do I get
back?

00:53:27.713 --> 00:53:29.686
LAURA: At a level two, that's 2d4.

00:53:29.686 --> 00:53:31.069
MATT: 2d4 plus five.

00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:32.509
TALIESIN: 13.

00:53:32.509 --> 00:53:38.917
MARISHA: Is that for everybody or just for her?

00:53:38.917 --> 00:53:40.544
LAURA: Everybody.

00:53:40.544 --> 00:53:46.126
MATT: Anyone who is affected by the spell, all
healing is maximum. For as long as it lasts, and

00:53:46.126 --> 00:53:52.147
it's concentration. Okay, that ends Pike's turn.
Pike can technically move five more feet from

00:53:52.147 --> 00:53:53.238
where she is.

00:53:53.238 --> 00:53:54.727
LAURA: But she can't hide, though.

00:53:54.727 --> 00:53:58.292
MATT: No. She's out in the open right now.
Scanlan, you're up.

00:53:58.292 --> 00:54:07.072
SAM: I'll move ten feet towards that way, still
ducking behind that stone there. I will inspire

00:54:07.072 --> 00:54:15.720
Percy. Wait, should I heal or inspire? I'll
inspire Percy. I'll sing him a lovely Christmas

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:26.164
song, (singing) You know Raishan and Vorugal, the
Frigid Doom, Brimscythe and Umbrasyl, we killed in

00:54:26.164 --> 00:54:36.220
his room. But do you recall the most fucked-up
dragon of all? Thordak the Cinder King had a

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:44.890
very shiny gem. And if you ever saw it, run the
fuck away from him.

00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:50.051
MATT: Take your d12 inspiration die.

00:54:50.051 --> 00:54:52.136
TALIESIN: All right. d12 is awesome.

00:54:52.136 --> 00:54:54.228
MATT: Bards are great. All right, that's your
bonus action.

00:54:54.228 --> 00:55:02.456
SAM: And for the move, I guess I'll attack him? I
don't do that very well. I'll do Bigby's Hand.

00:55:02.456 --> 00:55:05.881
(sings) Bigby's Hand! At level seven.

00:55:05.881 --> 00:55:08.785
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

00:55:08.785 --> 00:55:10.355
MATT: 7th-level Bigby's Hand!

00:55:10.355 --> 00:55:17.321
TALIESIN: We're just going to spray-paint Matt's
hand purple and he's going to sit there, punch things.

00:55:17.321 --> 00:55:19.362
LIAM: Check out the big hand on Scan.

00:55:19.362 --> 00:55:25.706
MATT: Where do you want Bigby's Hand to appear?
Within 120 feet.

00:55:25.706 --> 00:55:34.365
SAM: I guess keep it low. Just go for the ball
shot, yeah.

00:55:34.365 --> 00:55:37.062
MATT: All right, so what are you having the hand
do?

00:55:37.062 --> 00:55:40.419
SAM: Punch. Just punch.

00:55:40.419 --> 00:55:51.349
MATT: So Clenched Fist, and that is with plus 2d6
for each. Sorry, plus 2d8 for each slot above

00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:55.746
fifth. That is an additional 4d8. That is 8d8. If
it hits. Go ahead and roll your spell attack.

00:55:55.746 --> 00:56:01.869
SAM: 18.

00:56:01.869 --> 00:56:14.852
MATT: 18, no. The fist gleans off of Thordak's
chin. The dragon just kind of grins (growls). "Is

00:56:14.852 --> 00:56:17.444
"this all you've got?"

00:56:17.444 --> 00:56:21.406
SAM: Actually, yes. That is my biggest thing, so
yes.

00:56:21.406 --> 00:56:33.552
MATT: "Good." All right. That brings us back to
the top of the order. Now at the top of this

00:56:33.552 --> 00:56:36.202
round, we're going to start doing lair actions.

00:56:36.202 --> 00:56:37.940
LAURA: No!

00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:39.958
TALIESIN: Lair actions are the worst.

00:56:39.958 --> 00:56:42.347
MATT: It happens after Percy's turn, though.

00:56:42.347 --> 00:56:44.057
TALIESIN: Oh, good.

00:56:44.057 --> 00:56:45.768
MATT: So, Percy, your go.

00:56:45.768 --> 00:56:49.429
TALIESIN: Fine.

00:56:49.429 --> 00:56:54.143
LAURA: Make sure he dies before he gets anything
else.

00:56:54.143 --> 00:56:56.057
LIAM: Pull out your dragon gun.

00:56:56.057 --> 00:56:57.349
TALIESIN: My dragon gun?

00:56:57.349 --> 00:57:00.322
MARISHA: We're going to be real disappointed if
you can't take this all on your own.

00:57:00.322 --> 00:57:05.807
SAM: Wait a second, Matt! Doesn't he get a disadvantage
on his save because of my Cutting Words?

00:57:05.807 --> 00:57:07.704
MATT: That wasn't a save, that was your attack.

00:57:07.704 --> 00:57:09.902
SAM: Yeah. That's what I meant.

00:57:09.902 --> 00:57:12.139
MATT: On the next saving throw he has to make, he
has a disadvantage. Yes.

00:57:12.139 --> 00:57:17.175
SAM: Making sure you guys know how spells work.

00:57:17.175 --> 00:57:19.273
TRAVIS: Yep, thank you. I was confused.

00:57:19.273 --> 00:57:23.318
SAM: Jesus, Sam #3, why didn't you tell me that?!

00:57:23.318 --> 00:57:26.860
MATT: Percy, what are you doing?

00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:36.526
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a deep breath and
shoot directly north, or I suppose to you it would

00:57:36.526 --> 00:57:41.329
be south, down the map towards that building on
the far corner. I'm just going to run in that

00:57:41.329 --> 00:57:42.867
direction.

00:57:42.867 --> 00:57:46.486
MATT: As far as you can get with your full move?

00:57:46.486 --> 00:57:49.452
TALIESIN: That's as far as I can get with my full
movement? And he has to recharge his fire probably

00:57:49.452 --> 00:57:50.820
before he can do that again?

00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:53.165
MATT: Yeah, when it comes back to his turn I have
to roll to see if he gets it that round.

00:57:53.165 --> 00:57:58.906
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine. I'm going to take two
shots while I'm running. I'm going to, just

00:57:58.906 --> 00:58:06.581
because I'm not feeling lucky right now, I'm going
to burn another Deadeye on my first run, so let's

00:58:06.581 --> 00:58:07.696
do that.

00:58:07.696 --> 00:58:08.995
MARISHA: Are you feeling lucky?

00:58:08.995 --> 00:58:15.536
TALIESIN: No, no, I am really not. So less so that
I'm not even going to do sharpshooter. That's

00:58:15.536 --> 00:58:17.381
awesome! I take that back.

00:58:17.381 --> 00:58:19.178
MARISHA: Percy! You should have done it.

00:58:19.178 --> 00:58:24.045
TALIESIN: It's okay. Actually, that doesn't affect
the crit at all. Sharpshooter isn't affected by a

00:58:24.045 --> 00:58:29.802
crit. I critted, by the way. Sorry. That's nice.
So, hey! I get that Deadeye back. That's cool.

00:58:29.802 --> 00:58:32.987
TRAVIS: You should have said that first and we'd
all go, yay!

00:58:32.987 --> 00:58:38.223
TALIESIN: This is like bad college theater. No one
knows when to applaud. Excellent. That's-- oh my

00:58:38.223 --> 00:58:44.455
god, that's kind of nice. 1d12, 2d12, 3d12, 4d12.

00:58:44.455 --> 00:58:49.261
LIAM: Nice. Actually not bad. Pretty good. This
makes me happy. This is going to be funny.

00:58:49.261 --> 00:59:06.530
TALIESIN: Pretty good. That's not great, but it'll
do. 24 points of damage. And I'm going to take

00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:12.648
another shot. You know what? Screw it. Let's put a
sharpshooter on this. Actually, no. Never mind.

00:59:12.648 --> 00:59:19.819
Yes! I'm going to put a sharpshooter on this. I am
so nervous. I'm putting a sharpshooter on it. Which

00:59:19.819 --> 00:59:22.496
is good because I rolled--

00:59:22.496 --> 00:59:24.428
SAM: You have an inspiration.

00:59:24.428 --> 00:59:27.753
TALIESIN: 17, 18, 19, 26.

00:59:27.753 --> 00:59:28.887
MATT: 26 hits.

00:59:28.887 --> 00:59:44.933
TALIESIN: Yay. And that's 2d12. Yay. Boo, but
that's okay. 30 points of damage.

00:59:44.933 --> 00:59:51.675
MATT: Nice. So both shots as you are running
past, you watch as it slams into the sides,

00:59:51.675 --> 00:59:57.122
causing a little (explosion) out of the side of
Thordak's armor, the scales slip for a second. The

00:59:57.122 --> 01:00:00.912
second shot smashes a small hole in one of the
wings, but you watch as the leather seems to be

01:00:00.912 --> 01:00:05.920
largely unaffected by the impact. It's already
tattered at the bottom anyway, but well done.

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.535
TALIESIN: (high-pitched noises) Okay.

01:00:07.535 --> 01:00:13.504
MATT: So, there you are. At the end of your turn,
Thordak's going to go ahead and use one of his

01:00:13.504 --> 01:00:23.765
legendary actions to do a tail attack against Grog
right now, because you're within range.

01:00:23.765 --> 01:00:26.548
TRAVIS: Yeah, test your might. Oh no, please
don't! (sobs)

01:00:26.548 --> 01:00:29.569
MATT: That's going to be a 25 to hit.

01:00:29.569 --> 01:00:31.033
TRAVIS: It hits.

01:00:31.033 --> 01:00:37.651
MATT: Yep. You take 22 points of bludgeoning
damage, reduced to half, so 11 points of

01:00:37.651 --> 01:00:39.386
bludgeoning damage to you, Grog.

01:00:39.386 --> 01:00:40.695
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's good.

01:00:40.695 --> 01:00:49.385
MATT: All right. That ends that. At this point
now, you watch as through the clouds this winged

01:00:49.385 --> 01:00:57.359
figure comes and (crashing) lands on this distant
building, the flames flickering out.

01:00:57.359 --> 01:00:59.193
LAURA: Moment of truth. Moment of truth.

01:00:59.193 --> 01:01:10.293
MATT: As the impact happens, you watch as Thordak
turns and grins. "There you are. Oh, you're going

01:01:10.293 --> 01:01:19.462
"to taste so good." Raishan grins from the side.
"Not to worry, my king."

01:01:19.462 --> 01:01:22.432
SAM: Oh shit. That doesn't sound good.

01:01:22.432 --> 01:01:24.864
LAURA: I can't tell what she's going to do.

01:01:24.864 --> 01:01:27.504
SAM: Is she lying? She's a deceitful one.

01:01:27.504 --> 01:01:37.147
MATT: At this point, she will-- let me pull it up.
Oh there you go, there's the spell sheet. She's

01:01:37.147 --> 01:01:47.121
going to go ahead and move right there. Gets right
up onto the building that you guys are hiding

01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:50.530
behind as you feel the rubble and rock tumble
around you, you look up and you can see the giant

01:01:50.530 --> 01:01:59.284
green leathery wings unfurl. She inhales, her
chest expanding.

01:01:59.284 --> 01:02:01.619
(cheering)

01:02:01.619 --> 01:02:10.066
MATT: Releasing a giant cloud of poisonous gas in
the direction of Thordak. Into his face. Suprise,

01:02:10.066 --> 01:02:11.788
motherfucker!

01:02:11.788 --> 01:02:19.293
SAM: We have the best friends.

01:02:19.293 --> 01:02:29.887
MATT: Does not make his-- wait, this is a poison,
oh, it's constitution. He &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; make that. He

01:02:29.887 --> 01:02:34.278
takes 38 points of poison.

01:02:34.278 --> 01:02:35.947
TRAVIS: 38?

01:02:35.947 --> 01:02:49.880
MATT: 38 points of poison damage on that one. As
Thordak rears from the attack. "Oh, you'll die

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.586
"especially painfully."

01:02:52.586 --> 01:02:59.516
LIAM: Is Thordy La Forge poisoned there?

01:02:59.516 --> 01:03:01.820
MATT: No, he just takes poison damage.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:04.972
LIAM: No disadvantage. I really just wanted to say
Thordy La Forge.

01:03:04.972 --> 01:03:07.276
TALIESIN: Of course you did.

01:03:07.276 --> 01:03:16.485
MATT: All righty. So, that ends Raishan's turn.
Raishan's like, "Now, get in, circle and finish this!"

01:03:16.485 --> 01:03:18.258
MARISHA: Wait, Raishan said that?

01:03:18.258 --> 01:03:19.396
MATT: Yes.

01:03:19.396 --> 01:03:21.472
TRAVIS: No, that was Lady Kima's voice.

01:03:21.472 --> 01:03:24.074
(laughter)

01:03:24.074 --> 01:03:27.466
LIAM: Clarota, is that you? On a flying steed.

01:03:27.466 --> 01:03:31.371
MARISHA: I turn to Raishan and say, I don't take
orders from you, I'm only doing this because it's

01:03:31.371 --> 01:03:40.712
a good plan. And then I run in. If I run my full
movement, can I get into touch range with him?

01:03:40.712 --> 01:03:44.275
MATT: You can, yes.

01:03:44.275 --> 01:03:50.522
MARISHA: Okay, angry at what happened before and
realizing that not a lot is probably going to work

01:03:50.522 --> 01:03:59.979
unless I get ballsy, I run in guns blazing, and I
am going to do Contagion on him.

01:03:59.979 --> 01:04:01.754
MATT: Okay.

01:04:01.754 --> 01:04:04.520
MARISHA: I'm going to attempt Slimy Doom.

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.490
ALL: Ooh.

01:04:06.490 --> 01:04:11.995
MARISHA: In honor of Zahra! And her teaching us
about hentai!

01:04:11.995 --> 01:04:17.118
TRAVIS: Yup. I saw that hentai.

01:04:17.118 --> 01:04:20.066
SAM: We hear Zahra in the distance, "I'm still
alive!"

01:04:20.066 --> 01:04:27.962
MATT: Okay. So make a melee spell attack against
him. So roll a d20, add your spell attack bonus.

01:04:27.962 --> 01:04:30.322
MARISHA: I know, I'm picking the right one.

01:04:30.322 --> 01:04:34.357
LAURA: It should probably be like a black or a
green or something that's like slimy.

01:04:34.357 --> 01:04:36.017
MARISHA: I'll do a green one. Green's good.

01:04:36.017 --> 01:04:37.437
TRAVIS: Or just any dice.

01:04:37.437 --> 01:04:42.800
MARISHA: Shut up, Travis. Ooh, that's not too bad.
That's not too bad, plus 12? So that's 28!

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.561
MATT: 28 hits.

01:04:44.561 --> 01:04:47.911
MARISHA: (laughs) Redemption!

01:04:47.911 --> 01:04:50.422
LIAM: Keyleth is on The Price is Right.

01:04:50.422 --> 01:04:55.790
MATT: Contagion, we'll put that blue there. So at
the end of each of the target's turns it has to

01:04:55.790 --> 01:04:59.649
make a constitution saving throw. After failing
three, the disease takes effect.

01:04:59.649 --> 01:05:02.524
SAM: After failing three?

01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:03.761
MARISHA: He has to fail three.

01:05:03.761 --> 01:05:10.096
MATT: So as you're rushing up, running past the
tumbling rocks and boulders of the barely standing

01:05:10.096 --> 01:05:14.718
ceiling that Raishan's stepping on, you rush
towards Thordak, and getting closer you see the

01:05:14.718 --> 01:05:19.512
immense size towering above you. And getting this
close, there is a heated presence around him, like

01:05:19.512 --> 01:05:23.452
an aura of superheated air that burns you as you
get close enough to touch him. You reach out and

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:28.064
grab as you cast the spell under your breath. And
as you touch the edge of his scales, it's like

01:05:28.064 --> 01:05:33.065
touching a hot iron (sizzles). Your fingers singe
upon contact, but you feel the burst of druidic

01:05:33.065 --> 01:05:40.766
energy pierce through the scales and you watch as a
little bit of black power seeps into the body and

01:05:40.766 --> 01:05:42.954
curls in between the scales and has taken root.

01:05:42.954 --> 01:05:44.764
TRAVIS: (whispered) Yes.

01:05:44.764 --> 01:05:53.288
MARISHA: That's all I got, right? I'm going to
turn. Grog, you're still down, right?

01:05:53.288 --> 01:05:54.428
TRAVIS: (weakly) Yeah.

01:05:54.428 --> 01:06:00.923
MARISHA: I'm going to do a bonus Healing Word on
Grog. I'm going to go ahead and do it at third--

01:06:00.923 --> 01:06:03.110
MATT: Can't do third level because you cast a
5th-level spell.

01:06:03.110 --> 01:06:04.530
MARISHA: Second level.

01:06:04.530 --> 01:06:07.296
MATT: All right. So 2d4 plus six.

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:10.595
MARISHA: But it's max. Eight plus six.

01:06:10.595 --> 01:06:13.948
MATT: 14. You heal 14.

01:06:13.948 --> 01:06:16.564
TRAVIS: Woohoo! 14 points. 194.

01:06:16.564 --> 01:06:22.090
MATT: All right. At the end of your turn,
Thordak's going to go ahead and use his next two

01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:29.928
legendary actions to use his wing attack. Thordak,
now being surrounded by everything, goes (wing

01:06:29.928 --> 01:06:35.559
flapping). He begins beating his wings. You watch
as the flames on the ground begin to curl up into

01:06:35.559 --> 01:06:40.983
these small tornadoes in the presence from the
sheer vacuum of wind up under the wings. I need

01:06:40.983 --> 01:06:46.904
Grog and Keyleth and Raishan to make dexterity
saving throws.

01:06:46.904 --> 01:06:51.653
TRAVIS: I think I have advantage on those,
(singing) because I got Danger Sense!

01:06:51.653 --> 01:06:56.815
MARISHA: 12.

01:06:56.815 --> 01:06:59.686
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

01:06:59.686 --> 01:07:01.183
ALL: Ooh.

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:17.150
MATT: So you stay put, hunkering down for this.
Keyleth, you suffer 13 points of bludgeoning

01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:21.592
damage. 13 points of bludgeoning damage and six
points of fire damage.

01:07:21.592 --> 01:07:24.526
MARISHA: To three, so 16 total.

01:07:24.526 --> 01:07:34.291
MATT: Yes, and you are knocked prone as the wind
blows you to the ground. And the dragon can move

01:07:34.291 --> 01:07:43.613
up to half its movement speed. So it's going to
pull back to there.

01:07:43.613 --> 01:07:48.435
SAM: Do you get an attack, Grog?

01:07:48.435 --> 01:07:52.257
MATT: You do. As you get hit by that, by the way,
you can do retaliation or you can do your attack

01:07:52.257 --> 01:07:53.969
of opportunity, either works right now.

01:07:53.969 --> 01:07:56.809
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. Reckless and Great Weapon
Master.

01:07:56.809 --> 01:08:01.610
MATT: Go for it.

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:04.804
TRAVIS: Eight and that's a natural 20.

01:08:04.804 --> 01:08:08.058
MATT: Go ahead and roll your brutal damage there.

01:08:08.058 --> 01:08:11.650
SAM: Wow. That's a hit.

01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:23.024
TRAVIS: 19, 20, plus ten is 30 points of damage,
including the one point of necrotic, and then I

01:08:23.024 --> 01:08:23.961
double that?

01:08:23.961 --> 01:08:25.311
LIAM: Double all the dice.

01:08:25.311 --> 01:08:27.308
TRAVIS: Double all the dice. Right so, 60.

01:08:27.308 --> 01:08:30.386
LAURA: No. Double the dice.

01:08:30.386 --> 01:08:40.096
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry. Okay. 12, so 25, 35, 37.

01:08:40.096 --> 01:08:41.613
MATT: 37, nice.

01:08:41.613 --> 01:08:43.325
TRAVIS: Thanks. Two points necrotic.

01:08:43.325 --> 01:08:46.898
MATT: Yes. Okay. So, as the wind beats up and the
dragon begins to back up--

01:08:46.898 --> 01:08:49.244
LAURA: Did you add your plus ten, because it was
Reckless?

01:08:49.244 --> 01:08:50.556
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:08:50.556 --> 01:08:53.867
MATT: --hovering off the ground, you strike out
with the-- technically, yeah, it was Reckless, you

01:08:53.867 --> 01:08:58.392
cannot do Great Weapon Master on the-- well, I
guess you can on any attack you make. I'll double

01:08:58.392 --> 01:09:01.240
check on that real fast. So we'll say that's right
there.

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.315
TRAVIS: Yeah, if it's a reaction I'm not quite
sure.

01:09:03.315 --> 01:09:05.368
MATT: I'm going to double check just to make
sure.

01:09:05.368 --> 01:09:08.093
TRAVIS: That could have been better.

01:09:08.093 --> 01:09:10.115
LAURA: That's okay, that was a six.

01:09:10.115 --> 01:09:13.487
MATT: On your turn, so no, you cannot do that, so
26, yes.

01:09:13.487 --> 01:09:17.458
SAM: That's great! That's extra! That's just
bonus.

01:09:17.458 --> 01:09:24.460
MATT: You reach out with the axe amongst the heat
and the wind blowing in your face (wind blows) and

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:28.170
strike across the front of Thordak's chest as he
begins to swing back with his wings beating out.

01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:33.904
All right, at the end of that turn, as Thordak
does that, at the end of that turn, Raishan's

01:09:33.904 --> 01:09:37.463
going to use two legendary actions to cast Blight
on Thordak.

01:09:37.463 --> 01:09:39.529
TRAVIS: There's some shit going down on this map.

01:09:39.529 --> 01:09:46.008
LAURA: Oh my God, Matt. I'm impressed and
terrified of you for having to keep track of this.

01:09:46.008 --> 01:09:49.075
LIAM: They should really just do it already.

01:09:49.075 --> 01:09:52.673
LAURA: I honestly had no idea what my hands were
going to do.

01:09:52.673 --> 01:09:57.146
MATT: Constitution saving throw from Thordak.

01:09:57.146 --> 01:09:59.819
SAM: At disadvantage!

01:09:59.819 --> 01:10:04.555
MATT: At disadvantage. That's a natural one. He is
going to use one of his legendary resistances.

01:10:04.555 --> 01:10:06.317
LAURA: Get rid of them.

01:10:06.317 --> 01:10:10.019
MARISHA: Burn it, burn it! Burn that shit.

01:10:10.019 --> 01:10:13.081
SAM: He might have five of those.

01:10:13.081 --> 01:10:14.487
TALIESIN: Yeah and now he's got four.

01:10:14.487 --> 01:10:15.970
MARISHA: He has three, right?

01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:18.103
LAURA: He's probably got more than three. He's
Thordak.

01:10:18.103 --> 01:10:20.745
TALIESIN: Thordak, he's got like 12.

01:10:20.745 --> 01:10:31.017
MATT: He takes 18 points of necrotic damage. All
right. And because I initially forgot it, lair

01:10:31.017 --> 01:10:32.247
action!

01:10:32.247 --> 01:10:36.043
SAM: Oh shit. Lair action.

01:10:36.043 --> 01:10:37.378
MATT: Lair action, indeed.

01:10:37.378 --> 01:10:41.707
LAURA: Isn't that like if you forget to move or
something, you don't get to do it later, if you

01:10:41.707 --> 01:10:43.500
forgot about it?

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.604
SAM: Everyone with knees dies.

01:10:45.604 --> 01:10:49.763
MATT: For that, we're going to choose--

01:10:49.763 --> 01:10:52.531
LAURA: No no no no, I was just joshing you!

01:10:52.531 --> 01:10:57.126
TALIESIN: Don't make him look things up, it's
always going to be worse.

01:10:57.126 --> 01:11:08.335
MATT: The two twins that have currently ducked
around the way, you feel the ground nearby begin

01:11:08.335 --> 01:11:14.042
to shake, and down below you the earth cracks open
and a giant column of magma (explosion) shoots out

01:11:14.042 --> 01:11:15.380
and sprays in the vicinity.

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:16.531
LIAM: Evasion!

01:11:16.531 --> 01:11:17.804
MATT: You've already used Evasion.

01:11:17.804 --> 01:11:21.431
LIAM: On this round? It's once a round. This is a
whole new round.

01:11:21.431 --> 01:11:26.368
MATT: Actually, you're right, you're right. You
haven't gone since then. All right. Dexterity

01:11:26.368 --> 01:11:28.502
saving throw from both of you.

01:11:28.502 --> 01:11:31.168
LIAM: Okay. At advantage, because of those boots,
man!

01:11:31.168 --> 01:11:36.045
LAURA: That's good. (whispers) Okay, that's good,
that's good.

01:11:36.045 --> 01:11:37.601
LIAM: 23.

01:11:37.601 --> 01:11:39.844
LAURA: 27.

01:11:39.844 --> 01:11:43.325
MATT: Okay. You both take--

01:11:43.325 --> 01:11:47.271
LIAM: Did we fail the save?

01:11:47.271 --> 01:11:49.405
MATT: You succeeded on the save.

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:50.838
LIAM: So I take zero.

01:11:50.838 --> 01:11:57.468
MATT: So you take zero. You, however, take what
would be 12 points of fire damage reduced to half,

01:11:57.468 --> 01:11:58.747
so six.

01:11:58.747 --> 01:12:00.839
SAM: (scoffs) You call this a lair?

01:12:00.839 --> 01:12:10.789
MATT: All right. That ends Keyleth's go, it's now
Jarett. Jarett, who's loaded up his crossbow, is

01:12:10.789 --> 01:12:19.730
going to go ahead and spin around, take two shots
at Thordak. That's a cocked die. That's good. 18

01:12:19.730 --> 01:12:33.156
plus seven hits, and the second one just barely
hits, actually. There's two hits on him. Five

01:12:33.156 --> 01:12:35.574
points. Two ones in a row for damage, are you
serious? Okay.

01:12:35.574 --> 01:12:37.132
MARISHA: Goddamn it, Jarett.

01:12:37.132 --> 01:12:38.924
LAURA: It's okay, I'm happy that he's here.

01:12:38.924 --> 01:12:40.548
LIAM: Happens to everybody.

01:12:40.548 --> 01:12:46.578
MATT: And then he is going to try and move back
this way to keep everyone scattered and use the

01:12:46.578 --> 01:12:50.045
space to his advantage. That's going to end
Jarett's turn.

01:12:50.045 --> 01:12:54.711
TALIESIN: Is there a little hole in the ground
where the magma came out or no?

01:12:54.711 --> 01:13:03.473
MATT: No, it burst and then it cooled and covered
the space. All righty. That brings us to Gilmore's

01:13:03.473 --> 01:13:07.966
turn. Gilmore, who's in a bad place, is going to
go ahead and take his superior healing potion.

01:13:07.966 --> 01:13:11.011
TALIESIN: Gets max healing, because he was in the
spell.

01:13:11.011 --> 01:13:20.448
MATT: That's true. Yeah, so he takes 16, 20, 24
plus eight is 32. Nice.

01:13:20.448 --> 01:13:22.755
MARISHA: That's awesome! Good spell!

01:13:22.755 --> 01:13:26.602
LIAM: Thanks Pike. We're so glad you're here.

01:13:26.602 --> 01:13:36.065
MATT: Gilmore, who currently drinks the potion.
"This is already not the best start to this, but

01:13:36.065 --> 01:13:38.693
"let's see what else I can do here."

01:13:38.693 --> 01:13:49.054
LIAM: Come on, Shaun.

01:13:49.054 --> 01:14:00.265
MATT: He's going to try a Hold Monster. From where
he is right there. That's a wisdom saving throw

01:14:00.265 --> 01:14:10.937
for Thordak. Yeah, that succeeds. That's a nine
plus-- but he tried.

01:14:10.937 --> 01:14:12.812
SAM: And looked good doing it.

01:14:12.812 --> 01:14:15.536
LAURA: That's right. Those robes are fabulous,
Gilmore!

01:14:15.536 --> 01:14:30.082
MATT: "Thank you!" He goes darting behind the
other building off the opposite side. Yeah, that

01:14:30.082 --> 01:14:33.988
actually doesn't help in this
circumstance. That ends his turn. Grog.

01:14:33.988 --> 01:14:35.064
TRAVIS: Yes?

01:14:35.064 --> 01:14:36.810
MATT: It's you and the dragon's go.

01:14:36.810 --> 01:14:39.070
TRAVIS: (giggles) Now, who's going first this
time?

01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:40.908
MATT: You both are going at the same time, so what
are you going to do?

01:14:40.908 --> 01:14:45.955
TRAVIS: Ah, you want to know what I'm going to do,
do you? Intimidated by my presence, eh? Whack the

01:14:45.955 --> 01:14:47.542
Titanstone Knuckles!

01:14:47.542 --> 01:14:53.050
SAM: You're now 1/16 his size.

01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:57.768
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. I now come up to his ankle
bone. Life is a thrill.

01:14:57.768 --> 01:14:59.342
MATT: Basically.

01:14:59.342 --> 01:15:05.457
TRAVIS: Can I use my full-- oh, he's far away.
Shit.

01:15:05.457 --> 01:15:06.998
MATT: Yeah, he moved away from you.

01:15:06.998 --> 01:15:15.396
TRAVIS: Balls and ass. I would like to run
straight forward and then veer off to this side,

01:15:15.396 --> 01:15:17.623
I'm flanking him.

01:15:17.623 --> 01:15:18.855
MATT: This side over here?

01:15:18.855 --> 01:15:19.725
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:15:19.725 --> 01:15:21.116
MATT: Yeah. You can get over to there.

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:22.770
TRAVIS: Great. Am I now within striking range?

01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:23.921
MATT: You are.

01:15:23.921 --> 01:15:25.893
TRAVIS: I would like to make all three attack
Great Weapon Master, Reckless!

01:15:25.893 --> 01:15:27.657
MATT: Go for it.

01:15:27.657 --> 01:15:38.728
TRAVIS: 12, oh, so close. Damn it, covering up the
wrong page. That's, damn it, 19.

01:15:38.728 --> 01:15:42.463
MATT: 19. The first strike, you slam the axe as
your form grows, rushing up next to the dragon,

01:15:42.463 --> 01:15:48.583
grinning, feeling the foam gathering at the corner
of your mouth. You swing with the axe and carves a

01:15:48.583 --> 01:15:51.083
small line, but doesn't actually penetrate the
armor of Thordak.

01:15:51.083 --> 01:15:56.654
TRAVIS: (Scottish accent) Great. That's better.
That is a 26.

01:15:56.654 --> 01:15:58.001
MATT: That hits.

01:15:58.001 --> 01:15:59.754
TRAVIS: Good.

01:15:59.754 --> 01:16:02.227
TALIESIN: You beat the Scottish into him.

01:16:02.227 --> 01:16:04.250
TRAVIS: 27 minus five is 22.

01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:06.244
MATT: 22 misses.

01:16:06.244 --> 01:16:09.199
TALIESIN: Good to know. We're learning. 22
misses.

01:16:09.199 --> 01:16:10.903
MATT: Roll damage on that strike.

01:16:10.903 --> 01:16:13.096
TRAVIS: I got to get rid of that fucking Great
Weapon Master, that thing's killing me.

01:16:13.096 --> 01:16:14.686
LAURA: Oh yeah.

01:16:14.686 --> 01:16:20.063
LIAM: His AC is high, so ditch the handicap.

01:16:20.063 --> 01:16:24.944
TRAVIS: Hey, that's a six! Six points of necrotic
for a total of 36 points of damage.

01:16:24.944 --> 01:16:30.678
MATT: 36 points of damage. Nice. So, as two blows
are deflected from the armor, one does sink in

01:16:30.678 --> 01:16:37.789
pretty hard, carving a piece of dragon flesh
that's dangling off now in the torso region.

01:16:37.789 --> 01:16:39.943
Thordak's like (snarls).

01:16:39.943 --> 01:16:41.968
TRAVIS: 'Ello, poppet.

01:16:41.968 --> 01:16:43.895
MATT: "Insect."

01:16:43.895 --> 01:16:45.765
TRAVIS: Sect?

01:16:45.765 --> 01:16:47.397
MATT: Is that your turn?

01:16:47.397 --> 01:16:49.630
TRAVIS: Oh, insect. Yeah, that's my turn.

01:16:49.630 --> 01:17:00.912
MATT: Yeah, okay. Thordak begins laughing, (deep
laugh).

01:17:00.912 --> 01:17:05.668
LAURA: Oh no, this is the laughter we heard about.
It drives you crazy. I cover my ears!

01:17:05.668 --> 01:17:08.799
MATT: The fire breath does not come back, it's a
two.

01:17:08.799 --> 01:17:11.931
SAM: Oh, whew.

01:17:11.931 --> 01:17:13.469
TRAVIS: The fire breath does not recharge?

01:17:13.469 --> 01:17:14.500
MATT: Nope.

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:17.222
MARISHA: That's good, that's good.

01:17:17.222 --> 01:17:21.575
MATT: However, he does make a full multiattack and
that's four attacks against you.

01:17:21.575 --> 01:17:27.160
TRAVIS: On me? I'm trying to keep him warm! Like,
I'm trying to give him a little touch, little

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:29.002
feel, let him know that we love him.

01:17:29.002 --> 01:17:33.687
MATT: And it's with advantage against you?

01:17:33.687 --> 01:17:35.212
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's right.

01:17:35.212 --> 01:17:37.917
MATT: Okay, that's a 34.

01:17:37.917 --> 01:17:39.473
TRAVIS: I think that'll hit.

01:17:39.473 --> 01:17:45.797
MATT: Natural one and a 15, that is a 32. Natural
20.

01:17:45.797 --> 01:17:48.447
SAM: On the last one, I'm going to Cutting Words.

01:17:48.447 --> 01:17:50.468
TRAVIS: There's three. There's one more.

01:17:50.468 --> 01:17:52.381
SAM: Then on the last one.

01:17:52.381 --> 01:17:55.157
MATT: Okay. Natural 20! (laughs)

01:17:55.157 --> 01:17:57.619
SAM: Well then, maybe that won't help.

01:17:57.619 --> 01:18:00.610
TRAVIS: (singing) Happy trails to... shit.

01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:06.969
MATT: Okay, so a bite, two claw attacks, and a
tail attack against you, as its tail swings down

01:18:06.969 --> 01:18:19.708
and whips towards you. So, first, the bite attack.
You suffer 16 plus a 12. 28 points of piercing

01:18:19.708 --> 01:18:22.802
damage reduced to 14 as well as--

01:18:22.802 --> 01:18:30.869
MARISHA: Come on, this is what you're built for.
This is why we trained you.

01:18:30.869 --> 01:18:35.414
MATT: 19 points of fire damage, reduced that to
nine.

01:18:35.414 --> 01:18:37.301
TRAVIS: Cool.

01:18:37.301 --> 01:18:44.987
MATT: So that's the first, that's the bite attack.
The two claw attacks against you. That is 18

01:18:44.987 --> 01:18:50.650
points of slashing damage reduced to nine. And
then the critical on the claw attack. That is--

01:18:50.650 --> 01:18:52.558
TRAVIS: Was there no fire damage on the second
one?

01:18:52.558 --> 01:19:04.032
MATT: No, that's just the bite attack. That is 32
points of slashing damage, reduced to 16. And the

01:19:04.032 --> 01:19:12.402
tail attack, that is also a crit. 24. 36 points of
bludgeoning damage.

01:19:12.402 --> 01:19:14.418
SAM: Can I Cutting Words that?

01:19:14.418 --> 01:19:15.993
MATT: You can, yes.

01:19:15.993 --> 01:19:22.515
SAM: So I yell at him, "You're so ugly, you scared
the shit out of an outhouse!"

01:19:22.515 --> 01:19:29.783
MATT: Go ahead and roll your d12. 36.

01:19:29.783 --> 01:19:32.105
SAM: Make that a 33.

01:19:32.105 --> 01:19:45.589
MATT: So 16 points of bludgeoning damage. And as
part of his multiattack, he also uses his

01:19:45.589 --> 01:19:54.090
Frightful Presence, so everyone, as you see it
clawing at Grog, it's like (roars), the tail whips

01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:58.231
down and slams the ground. The entire ground
quakes and you feel all the flames grow brighter

01:19:58.231 --> 01:20:05.309
in the vicinity. While Thordak is large in this
moment, it's like staring at a fire god. I need

01:20:05.309 --> 01:20:06.575
everybody--

01:20:06.575 --> 01:20:08.453
TALIESIN: Who is not immune to fear?

01:20:08.453 --> 01:20:10.327
LAURA: We're all immune to fear.

01:20:10.327 --> 01:20:12.034
MATT: Everyone, yeah, all of you are immune to
fear.

01:20:12.034 --> 01:20:14.315
LAURA: Yeah. Except for Jarett.

01:20:14.315 --> 01:20:21.579
MATT: Except for Jarett. Jarett does not succeed!
Jarett is pissing himself right now behind. He

01:20:21.579 --> 01:20:24.831
almost ran into the wall and is like, "Oh, this is
not good!" (yells)

01:20:24.831 --> 01:20:29.410
LIAM: Hey, Thordy, eat a dick.

01:20:29.410 --> 01:20:33.189
MATT: Raishan does make her save.

01:20:33.189 --> 01:20:34.397
SAM: Does not?

01:20:34.397 --> 01:20:35.312
MATT: Does.

01:20:35.312 --> 01:20:36.727
LAURA: Oh, good.

01:20:36.727 --> 01:20:44.737
TRAVIS: Legendary? Did he do his legendary thingy?
Or he just made it?

01:20:44.737 --> 01:20:48.736
MARISHA: Yeah, he also has to save against my
Contagion.

01:20:48.736 --> 01:20:55.197
MATT: His turn's not done yet. Raishan uses her
legendary resistance to resist the-- Oh sorry, she

01:20:55.197 --> 01:21:01.765
doesn't have to because she made it. From the
shaking and the quaking you watch as the flames

01:21:01.765 --> 01:21:09.233
that brighten up leap out of the sides in the form
of two fire elementals.

01:21:09.233 --> 01:21:10.601
LAURA: Damn it!

01:21:10.601 --> 01:21:13.091
MATT: That leap out of the sides of the cavern.

01:21:13.091 --> 01:21:14.583
LAURA: Can they fly?

01:21:14.583 --> 01:21:16.991
TRAVIS: Can we bring all the alcohol on set right
now?

01:21:16.991 --> 01:21:22.434
TALIESIN: There's a lot of alcohol on the set
right now. A lot of it's hiding.

01:21:22.434 --> 01:21:24.249
LIAM: How about acknowledge it?

01:21:24.249 --> 01:21:26.699
TALIESIN: There's a mini fridge built into
Trinket.

01:21:26.699 --> 01:21:32.722
LIAM: Ancient dragon wasn't enough, huh, Matt?

01:21:32.722 --> 01:21:37.637
MATT: Thordak is going to move around Grog to this
side.

01:21:37.637 --> 01:21:42.511
TRAVIS: Yeah, move around me, bitch. I'm going to
get my insults in while I'm still breathing.

01:21:42.511 --> 01:21:45.224
MARISHA: He accidentally stepped on one of his
elemental friends.

01:21:45.224 --> 01:21:51.180
MATT: He moved around it. It's fine. The
elementals are now going the same turn as Thordak.

01:21:51.180 --> 01:22:15.980
50 feet. Ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50. This
elemental. 35, 40, 45, 50. Right there. They're

01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:20.997
going to rush up and get into base to base with
you guys, and up to Keyleth, who's currently on

01:22:20.997 --> 01:22:26.108
the ground prone as the elemental (roar) and comes
up against you. You hear the familiar sound of the

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:29.095
flickering flame of its elemental form rush up
towards you.

01:22:29.095 --> 01:22:33.485
MARISHA: I feel like I saw you, in like the fire
plane! 'Sup, man?

01:22:33.485 --> 01:22:49.968
MATT: All righty. At this time, you also hear a
distant sound in the sky. A (sharp whooshes), but

01:22:49.968 --> 01:22:53.374
you make no visual. Everyone roll a perception
check.

01:22:53.374 --> 01:22:57.602
SAM: 21.

01:22:57.602 --> 01:22:59.168
MARISHA: 24.

01:22:59.168 --> 01:23:00.469
TALIESIN: 12.

01:23:00.469 --> 01:23:02.476
LAURA: Do I get advantage because it's
dragon-related?

01:23:02.476 --> 01:23:03.854
MATT: This is not dragon-related.

01:23:03.854 --> 01:23:04.968
LIAM: 25.

01:23:04.968 --> 01:23:06.301
TRAVIS: Six.

01:23:06.301 --> 01:23:07.791
LAURA: 16.

01:23:07.791 --> 01:23:11.196
MATT: All right. Scanlan, you rolled a 21, you
said?

01:23:11.196 --> 01:23:12.204
SAM: 21.

01:23:12.204 --> 01:23:16.923
MATT: So, Scanlan, Keyleth, and Vax. You guys see
a shape in the darkness of clouds and the smoke

01:23:16.923 --> 01:23:23.122
ahead. In between the sounds of thunder and
lightning in the distance, you see the bow of the

01:23:23.122 --> 01:23:24.677
skyship Deera.

01:23:24.677 --> 01:23:26.332
LAURA: Yes, the skyship!

01:23:26.332 --> 01:23:29.968
TALIESIN: Fucking Teddy Ruxpin.

01:23:29.968 --> 01:23:32.805
MATT: (laughs) Vex, it's your turn.

01:23:32.805 --> 01:23:38.975
LAURA: Me? Okay. Where can I go to where I can hit
him?

01:23:38.975 --> 01:23:40.234
TRAVIS: Pretty much anywhere.

01:23:40.234 --> 01:23:46.152
MATT: With your bow, you have quite a few options.
So you'd have to move around this way or this way.

01:23:46.152 --> 01:23:47.783
LAURA: Is the fire elemental right next to me?

01:23:47.783 --> 01:23:50.026
MATT: It is. It'll get a swipe at you if you try
to move away from it.

01:23:50.026 --> 01:23:56.158
LAURA: Asshole. If I'm a third level rogue, do I
get disengage?

01:23:56.158 --> 01:23:58.906
MATT: As a bonus action, yeah.

01:23:58.906 --> 01:24:04.965
LAURA: Okay, so for my bonus action I'll
disengage. And then I'll move so I can hit

01:24:04.965 --> 01:24:12.591
Thordak. So can I move towards-- back towards the
very back building? Can I get all the way there?

01:24:12.591 --> 01:24:14.640
MATT: With Haste, yes, you can.

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:20.039
LAURA: Okay. So then I'm going to shoot him!
Before I duck in around a corner or whatever. And

01:24:20.039 --> 01:24:28.534
I want to-- oh, that's 18.

01:24:28.534 --> 01:24:33.537
MATT: 18 does not hit. So you rush past,
disengaging. You hit up against the edge of the

01:24:33.537 --> 01:24:36.652
wall with your arrow out (arrow whoosh). It arcs
past and misses.

01:24:36.652 --> 01:24:45.151
LAURA: Yeah, it's pretty far. Okay. This next one.
I'm going to use another poison arrow. Oh my

01:24:45.151 --> 01:24:47.809
God, I miss him again. Dice jail!

01:24:47.809 --> 01:24:51.625
MATT: That one hits the hide but ricochets off.

01:24:51.625 --> 01:24:59.882
LAURA: Okay okay. Third attack. 25.

01:24:59.882 --> 01:25:01.278
MATT: 25 hits.

01:25:01.278 --> 01:25:26.539
LAURA: Yay! One, that's one lightning, at 17 plus,
Grog is standing next to him? Yeah, it's good.

01:25:26.539 --> 01:25:29.397
That's nine, 13. Plus 13.

01:25:29.397 --> 01:25:31.442
SAM: Hey, that's many points.

01:25:31.442 --> 01:25:33.385
MATT: So a total of--?

01:25:33.385 --> 01:25:39.960
LAURA: 14, 15, 16, 17 plus 13.

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:48.388
MATT: So 30. Nice. All righty. So the final arrow
releases and (whoosh) gets stuck up under one of

01:25:48.388 --> 01:25:52.936
the scales on the side of where its shoulder and
body hits and the dragon, Thordak, turns and

01:25:52.936 --> 01:25:56.494
(roars and laughs).

01:25:56.494 --> 01:25:58.375
LAURA: Oh no, I hide behind that building.

01:25:58.375 --> 01:26:00.198
SAM: Oh, God. What was that?

01:26:00.198 --> 01:26:01.703
TRAVIS: Those faces are-- wow!

01:26:01.703 --> 01:26:03.515
TALIESIN: Yeah, way too many emotions happening
there.

01:26:03.515 --> 01:26:12.115
MATT: You hear the voice ring out, "Don't worry,
we'll take them down. All of them. Each and every one."

01:26:12.115 --> 01:26:13.937
LAURA: He's crazy as fuck.

01:26:13.937 --> 01:26:15.849
SAM: He's straight-up crazy.

01:26:15.849 --> 01:26:18.278
TALIESIN: No, he's not.

01:26:18.278 --> 01:26:19.890
MATT: That ends your turn, Vex?

01:26:19.890 --> 01:26:22.577
LAURA: I guess so, I mean, I don't know what else
I can do.

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:24.447
MATT: All right. Vax and Kima.

01:26:24.447 --> 01:26:26.622
SAM: When I was younger, I had an imaginary
friend, too.

01:26:26.622 --> 01:26:28.305
LIAM: Should I go, or should Kima go?

01:26:28.305 --> 01:26:34.662
MATT: (chuckles) Kima, frustratingly so, being a
short-ranged lady that she is, is first off going

01:26:34.662 --> 01:26:38.894
to glance over and see Keyleth on the ground. How
are you doing, Keyleth?

01:26:38.894 --> 01:26:48.734
MARISHA: I'm okay. I'm on the ground, but I'm not
super low. I'm still full on hit points. Well.

01:26:48.734 --> 01:26:52.001
MATT: Yeah, she's going to go full double move on
this one. She wants to get into the fray and is so

01:26:52.001 --> 01:26:57.819
frustrated that she's too far out of the way. Kima
is going to go ahead and rush out and do a 2d6

01:26:57.819 --> 01:27:01.515
heal to Gilmore again. So that's seven to
Gilmore.

01:27:01.515 --> 01:27:03.205
SAM: No, well he gets full healing.

01:27:03.205 --> 01:27:05.561
MATT: Oh that's right. 2d6, so it's a full 12.

01:27:05.561 --> 01:27:11.046
TALIESIN: That's so clutch. We should do that
every time from now on.

01:27:11.046 --> 01:27:24.467
MATT: Kima is now taking a full 50 foot move. 50.
Okay, she's charging in. "We've done this before

01:27:24.467 --> 01:27:29.503
"and we can do it again!" as she has her Holy
Avenger arcing over her shoulder, running

01:27:29.503 --> 01:27:34.727
screaming. (yells) Vax, what are you doing?

01:27:34.727 --> 01:27:37.453
LIAM: Bonus action, I'm taking the potion of
invulnerability.

01:27:37.453 --> 01:27:38.840
SAM: Oh, shit.

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:42.044
TRAVIS: Time to get crunk.

01:27:42.044 --> 01:27:44.805
LIAM: Next action, I cast Hunter's Mark on
Thordak.

01:27:44.805 --> 01:27:46.057
LAURA: Yeah!

01:27:46.057 --> 01:27:47.487
MATT: Okay.

01:27:47.487 --> 01:27:48.989
SAM: You can do that?

01:27:48.989 --> 01:27:54.571
LIAM: Then I fly at Thordak's face and strike at
him with the dragon-slayer sword.

01:27:54.571 --> 01:27:56.600
(cheering)

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:57.759
LIAM: Face. Face.

01:27:57.759 --> 01:27:59.278
MATT: Right, so you're up in the air now.

01:27:59.278 --> 01:28:07.489
LIAM: At advantage. Good. 26 hits.

01:28:07.489 --> 01:28:09.216
MATT: Yes, it does.

01:28:09.216 --> 01:28:16.170
LIAM: So this is dragon-slayer sword plus Sneak
Attack, I'm going to Smite and Hunter's Mark.

01:28:16.170 --> 01:28:18.770
SAM: That's all the attacks.

01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:20.736
LIAM: Yes, all the attacks.

01:28:20.736 --> 01:28:22.356
TALIESIN: Every die.

01:28:22.356 --> 01:28:47.639
LIAM: Okay, nine plus six is 17, plus-- 18, 19, 21,
balls. 21, okay plus the Sneak Attack. 27, 29, 33,

01:28:47.639 --> 01:28:58.226
39, 40, 42, 44, plus the Hunter's Mark, 45 total.

01:28:58.226 --> 01:29:00.331
MATT: That includes the Smite damage as well?

01:29:00.331 --> 01:29:02.106
LIAM: No, no.

01:29:02.106 --> 01:29:04.974
MATT: It's 2d8.

01:29:04.974 --> 01:29:07.347
LIAM: Now we're at 50.

01:29:07.347 --> 01:29:09.912
SAM: What about the dragon sword? Did you do
that?

01:29:09.912 --> 01:29:14.387
LIAM: That's done. So I don't know exactly how far
it was to his face and I know I'm all out of moves

01:29:14.387 --> 01:29:20.535
and I'm open to getting bitten again, but I want
to fly away from his face as far as I can and land

01:29:20.535 --> 01:29:24.847
opposite everybody. Maybe near the lip. No, behind
the building behind him.

01:29:24.847 --> 01:29:29.535
MATT: I'm currently working out how much movement
you've done, because you're crazy.

01:29:29.535 --> 01:29:38.719
LIAM: 120 feet of movement.

01:29:38.719 --> 01:29:40.863
MATT: It's about 65 to get up to his face.

01:29:40.863 --> 01:29:42.443
LAURA: Oh, sweet.

01:29:42.443 --> 01:29:44.557
MATT: All right, and you're going to pull back
from him?

01:29:44.557 --> 01:29:50.441
LIAM: Curve over his, oh, no-- sword's in his
head? My friends are going to fucking kill you

01:29:50.441 --> 01:29:54.271
today, you fuck! Arc over his head.

01:29:54.271 --> 01:29:58.561
MATT: The blade, which has jammed itself right in
the cheekbone under the eye of the dragon, as you

01:29:58.561 --> 01:30:08.306
draw it out, there's a streak of dragon blood
(roar, unhinged laughter). You arc over. As you

01:30:08.306 --> 01:30:19.464
do, he reaches up with his face, his jaws (snarl)
reach out to try and bite you. That is a 21 to hit.

01:30:19.464 --> 01:30:20.681
LIAM: No.

01:30:20.681 --> 01:30:25.812
MATT: The jaws snap in the air, just as you coast
through with your wings.

01:30:25.812 --> 01:30:31.456
LIAM: I'll slam down, if I can, behind the
building behind his big fat ass.

01:30:31.456 --> 01:30:32.943
MATT: Sure.

01:30:32.943 --> 01:30:36.740
LAURA: I whisper on the earring, that was my
brother! That was my brother.

01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:42.226
MATT: You are going to have an attack of
opportunity from-- oh, no, you disengaged from the--

01:30:42.226 --> 01:30:43.457
LIAM: I didn't disengage.

01:30:43.457 --> 01:30:45.221
MATT: Oh, sorry, so the Fire Elemental actually
would have gotten an attack of opportunity on you

01:30:45.221 --> 01:30:46.988
as you ran past.

01:30:46.988 --> 01:30:50.690
LAURA: Before all that, he knocks you
unconscious.

01:30:50.690 --> 01:30:55.598
MATT: That's a 20-- yeah, misses.

01:30:55.598 --> 01:31:02.172
TALIESIN: Vax, it might be worth taking a peek in
that crater when you get a second.

01:31:02.172 --> 01:31:04.248
LIAM: Working on it, working on it.

01:31:04.248 --> 01:31:12.127
MATT: All righty, that ends your turn, Kima's
turn. Pike's up. However! At the end of Vax's

01:31:12.127 --> 01:31:18.478
turn, Thordak is going to go ahead and use a tail
attack against Grog.

01:31:18.478 --> 01:31:20.726
MARISHA: Did he ever make that save, by the way?

01:31:20.726 --> 01:31:22.323
SAM: Not yet.

01:31:22.323 --> 01:31:31.995
MATT: Disadvantage, which is good because it was a
natural 20. And a six, plus 16, 22. Makes it.

01:31:31.995 --> 01:31:38.463
LAURA: 22. He's got to roll under a four or lower
to get--

01:31:38.463 --> 01:31:40.355
SAM: There's no way, it's not going to happen.

01:31:40.355 --> 01:31:41.909
LAURA: It's possible! It's possible!

01:31:41.909 --> 01:31:43.379
MARISHA: It keeps going. It still goes.

01:31:43.379 --> 01:31:45.538
MATT: It keeps going. It lasts for seven days.

01:31:45.538 --> 01:31:47.719
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a seven-day thing.

01:31:47.719 --> 01:31:51.820
TRAVIS: After we're all dead, he'll get very sick.

01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:55.049
TALIESIN: If we die today, he's going to get the
flu later in his life.

01:31:55.049 --> 01:31:59.326
TRAVIS: Let's reason with him! You can die now,
wait for later--

01:31:59.326 --> 01:32:01.190
LIAM: "That doesn't look normal."

01:32:01.190 --> 01:32:05.188
TRAVIS: "Why does it burn when I pee?"

01:32:05.188 --> 01:32:13.554
MATT: However, it lasts for seven days, but
remember, that's if the spell succeeds. If he

01:32:13.554 --> 01:32:15.832
succeeds three saving throws, it goes away.

01:32:15.832 --> 01:32:17.742
MARISHA: If he succeeds three?

01:32:17.742 --> 01:32:18.822
MATT: Yeah.

01:32:18.822 --> 01:32:20.133
MARISHA: I thought he just had to fail.

01:32:20.133 --> 01:32:23.905
MATT: Fail three to take effect, succeed three to
just get rid of the disease.

01:32:23.905 --> 01:32:26.125
LIAM: Just dish out damage.

01:32:26.125 --> 01:32:28.068
LAURA: These damn spells.

01:32:28.068 --> 01:32:29.774
TALIESIN: He has disadvantage.

01:32:29.774 --> 01:32:36.713
MATT: So, anyway, that brings us to Pike. Oh, he
was doing the tail attack to you. So, using one of

01:32:36.713 --> 01:32:39.474
the Legendary Actions to make a tail strike
against--

01:32:39.474 --> 01:32:42.172
LIAM: So Legendaries can fall whenever they want?

01:32:42.172 --> 01:32:44.217
MATT: At the end of someone else's turn.

01:32:44.217 --> 01:32:45.687
TRAVIS: This is against me.

01:32:45.687 --> 01:32:59.656
MATT: Yeah, because you're right there. With
advantage. That would be 31. So yeah, that hits you.

01:32:59.656 --> 01:33:03.658
TALIESIN: I pray for a single-digit number.

01:33:03.658 --> 01:33:05.759
TRAVIS: Almost double my AC.

01:33:05.759 --> 01:33:08.778
MATT: 20 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to
ten.

01:33:08.778 --> 01:33:11.407
TALIESIN: Man, you are a tank.

01:33:11.407 --> 01:33:13.087
TRAVIS: Not much longer.

01:33:13.087 --> 01:33:14.613
TALIESIN: We're working on it.

01:33:14.613 --> 01:33:16.941
MATT: All righty. So, Pike, what's Pike doing?

01:33:16.941 --> 01:33:19.911
LAURA: Okay, Pike is going to run forward--

01:33:19.911 --> 01:33:21.394
LIAM: "Oh, Grog!"

01:33:21.394 --> 01:33:24.524
LAURA: "Oh, Grog!" And she runs as far forward as
she can.

01:33:24.524 --> 01:33:26.656
MATT: That's as far as she can get.

01:33:26.656 --> 01:33:31.233
LAURA: We're trying to get a little diagonal, she
wants to be 60 feet away from him.

01:33:31.233 --> 01:33:33.003
MATT: He's within 60 feet.

01:33:33.003 --> 01:33:37.338
LAURA: Okay. Can she be at a diagonal so she's not
lined up with Keyleth and Bigby?

01:33:37.338 --> 01:33:41.924
MATT: I mean, that's as far as she can get.

01:33:41.924 --> 01:33:47.637
LAURA: Okay. Then she casts Heal on Grog, which
gives him 70 hit points, automatically healed.

01:33:47.637 --> 01:33:49.335
TRAVIS: That's amazing!

01:33:49.335 --> 01:33:51.278
MATT: Yeah. So you're up 70 hit points, Grog.

01:33:51.278 --> 01:33:55.040
LAURA: And that's a 6th-level spell, so she's
going to cast Spiritual Weapon as a 5th-level

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.501
spell as her bonus action.

01:33:56.501 --> 01:33:58.885
MATT: She can't, because she already cast a
6th-level spell. If you do a spell that's higher

01:33:58.885 --> 01:34:01.549
than 2nd-level, you can only do a 2nd-level spell
as your bonus action.

01:34:01.549 --> 01:34:05.188
LAURA: Oh, &lt;i&gt;that's&lt;/i&gt; how it works. I thought it
just had to be lower than--

01:34:05.188 --> 01:34:08.797
MATT: Technically, rules as written, you can't do
that, but as we've been playing, for the sake of

01:34:08.797 --> 01:34:12.200
having so many players, I allow bonus action
spells as long as they're level two or lower.

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:13.633
LAURA: Should we just do it?

01:34:13.633 --> 01:34:14.674
TALIESIN: No, no.

01:34:14.674 --> 01:34:16.798
LAURA: If she does it at a 2nd-level, then--

01:34:16.798 --> 01:34:18.370
LIAM: And it'll keep going.

01:34:18.370 --> 01:34:19.551
LAURA: Yeah.

01:34:19.551 --> 01:34:21.453
TALIESIN: But what happens if you do it at a
higher level?

01:34:21.453 --> 01:34:22.755
MARISHA: More damage.

01:34:22.755 --> 01:34:25.933
LAURA: Well yeah, but she's always going to be at
a higher level than 2nd-level spells, so it

01:34:25.933 --> 01:34:27.072
doesn't matter.

01:34:27.072 --> 01:34:30.331
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, like, next round though,
if she does that at a 5th-level, just the damage

01:34:30.331 --> 01:34:33.392
it'll add will be more than double the damage
it'll do now.

01:34:33.392 --> 01:34:36.476
LIAM: I say wait, because she's doing her job.
She's keeping Grog alive.

01:34:36.476 --> 01:34:39.660
MARISHA: So you might want to do that at a lower
spell level, and keep the higher levels for

01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:41.020
healing.

01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:51.668
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. Wait-- okay, she can also
do Mass Healing Word as a bonus action at-- never

01:34:51.668 --> 01:34:53.262
mind, that's a 3rd-level spell, so fuck it.

01:34:53.262 --> 01:34:54.454
MATT: Yeah, sorry.

01:34:54.454 --> 01:34:57.287
LAURA: She can do Healing Word, though! At second
level.

01:34:57.287 --> 01:34:58.601
MATT: She can.

01:34:58.601 --> 01:35:01.398
LAURA: Should we do that? Who needs healing?

01:35:01.398 --> 01:35:02.998
SAM: I mean, everybody.

01:35:02.998 --> 01:35:05.108
LAURA: She's going to do Healing Word on Grog
again.

01:35:05.108 --> 01:35:06.817
LIAM: At max.

01:35:06.817 --> 01:35:12.913
MATT: Okay. So at second level, that means that's
2d4 plus five. So 13, you heal 13 hit points.

01:35:12.913 --> 01:35:14.091
TRAVIS: Nice!

01:35:14.091 --> 01:35:17.511
TALIESIN: Which is like another attack you absorb.
That's great. It's like one more attack to

01:35:17.511 --> 01:35:18.827
absorb.

01:35:18.827 --> 01:35:22.935
MATT: All right, that ends Pike's turn, then.
Scanlan, you're up.

01:35:22.935 --> 01:35:24.269
SAM: I'm up?

01:35:24.269 --> 01:35:25.279
MATT: Yes.

01:35:25.279 --> 01:35:35.785
SAM: For my attack, I will punch the fire
elemental currently menacing Kiki with my fist of

01:35:35.785 --> 01:35:37.062
fury.

01:35:37.062 --> 01:35:39.316
MATT: All righty, go ahead and roll a spell
attack.

01:35:39.316 --> 01:35:41.146
SAM: Okay, 24.

01:35:41.146 --> 01:35:42.433
MATT: That hits.

01:35:42.433 --> 01:35:43.736
LIAM: It would have hit the fucking dragon.

01:35:43.736 --> 01:35:46.744
MATT: It would've. So 8d8 points of damage to the
fire elemental.

01:35:46.744 --> 01:35:49.187
SAM: 8d8. I need all the d8s.

01:35:49.187 --> 01:35:51.252
TRAVIS: All the d8s.

01:35:51.252 --> 01:35:55.689
MARISHA: Here, I've got d8s, how many do you
need?

01:35:55.689 --> 01:35:58.888
LAURA: Hey, Scanlan. (mimes playing a flute)

01:35:58.888 --> 01:36:00.670
TALIESIN: That's seven.

01:36:00.670 --> 01:36:11.255
SAM: Four... I need one more. That's a d12.
(laughs) Oh man, these are all good, though.

01:36:11.255 --> 01:36:12.835
TALIESIN: So you want one more, though.

01:36:12.835 --> 01:36:21.734
SAM: I do. Oh my God! Okay. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
30, 41.

01:36:21.734 --> 01:36:27.850
MATT: 41 points of damage, nice! It slams into his
form and you watch as his body kind of tears open

01:36:27.850 --> 01:36:31.474
for a second, the flames dissipating and then form
back in, but they're starting to flicker.

01:36:31.474 --> 01:36:32.921
SAM: He's not dead?

01:36:32.921 --> 01:36:33.888
MATT: No.

01:36:33.888 --> 01:36:35.888
SAM: As my bonus action, I'll punch him again.

01:36:35.888 --> 01:36:37.090
MATT: No bonus.

01:36:37.090 --> 01:36:40.776
SAM: That was my action, as a bonus action, I can
do something else with Bigby, no?

01:36:40.776 --> 01:36:42.935
MATT: Let me double check.

01:36:42.935 --> 01:36:48.833
SAM: Every subsequent action I can do something as
a bonus action, does that also negate the action?

01:36:48.833 --> 01:36:53.798
MATT: When you cast a spell as a bonus action, it
says here you can move the hand and cause the

01:36:53.798 --> 01:37:01.935
effects. It's your bonus action to move the spell.
So your action is there, I'll say-- it says

01:37:01.935 --> 01:37:03.681
specifically bonus action.

01:37:03.681 --> 01:37:05.681
SAM: So I can't do it as my action?

01:37:05.681 --> 01:37:07.537
LAURA: So you can do something else!

01:37:07.537 --> 01:37:09.112
SAM: So that was my bonus action, then.

01:37:09.112 --> 01:37:10.342
MATT: Correct, to do that is your bonus.

01:37:10.342 --> 01:37:11.514
SAM: So I can do something else, then?

01:37:11.514 --> 01:37:13.658
MATT: I'll let you do it again if you want to.

01:37:13.658 --> 01:37:21.164
SAM: No, no, no, I'll do something else. Oh! By
the way, I can't use my movement to drink a

01:37:21.164 --> 01:37:22.385
potion, right?

01:37:22.385 --> 01:37:23.280
MATT: No.

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:24.480
SAM: Okay (laughs).

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:26.085
TRAVIS: (laughing) I'd like to drink a potion.

01:37:26.085 --> 01:37:31.043
SAM: Can I lean over the wall there? And I'll
Lightning Bolt the same guy.

01:37:31.043 --> 01:37:41.501
MATT: Okay. So it would be over the edge of that
wall there and (blasting noise). All right, go for

01:37:41.501 --> 01:37:52.936
it. So that's a no. That is a 12 for its dexterity
saving throw, so it takes full damage.

01:37:52.936 --> 01:37:55.386
SAM: All right, so.

01:37:55.386 --> 01:37:58.255
TALIESIN and SAM: Oh!

01:37:58.255 --> 01:38:01.548
SAM: Four ones in a row so far, so--

01:38:01.548 --> 01:38:04.105
(laughter)

01:38:04.105 --> 01:38:12.328
SAM: So I made up for some of them. 15.

01:38:12.328 --> 01:38:19.051
MATT: 15 points of lightning damage against the
fire elemental. Okay, the bolt hits it and the

01:38:19.051 --> 01:38:24.634
fire elemental goes (sizzling), not terribly
damaged by the impact.

01:38:24.634 --> 01:38:26.719
TRAVIS: At least it didn't point and laugh at you.

01:38:26.719 --> 01:38:28.560
MATT: Okay, do you want to stay where you are?

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:30.273
SAM: Yeah, absolutely.

01:38:30.273 --> 01:38:34.465
MATT: Okay, that ends Scanlan's turn. Up to the
top: Percival.

01:38:34.465 --> 01:38:37.861
TRAVIS: He used your full first name.

01:38:37.861 --> 01:38:39.903
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay, that's fine.

01:38:39.903 --> 01:38:41.363
MARISHA: It's like when you're in trouble.

01:38:41.363 --> 01:38:45.175
TALIESIN: I am in trouble. I have a whole bunch of
your d8s over here, by the way. Feel free to pull

01:38:45.175 --> 01:38:52.666
them out whenever you like. I'm going to try a
couple things. I'm going to do a piercing shot on

01:38:52.666 --> 01:38:59.074
the fire elemental, which I think I can do. I'm
going to start moving in a northerly direction, so

01:38:59.074 --> 01:39:07.200
I guess I'll take like one or two steps southwest,
I suppose it would be to you. Yeah, there you go.

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:08.452
MATT: There?

01:39:08.452 --> 01:39:26.860
TALIESIN: Yeah, that'll do it. And I'm going to do
a piercing shot. That burns a grit, okay. That'll

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:33.700
do! That's 25 to hit the elemental.

01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:35.623
MATT: 25 hits.

01:39:35.623 --> 01:39:37.678
TALIESIN: And now I have to roll again for
Thordak?

01:39:37.678 --> 01:39:43.154
MATT: Well, you have to decide whether your-- if
it's a piercing shot affecting also Kima or Grog.

01:39:43.154 --> 01:39:46.599
Because it's a straight line, and it hits--
depending on how you angle it, you're either

01:39:46.599 --> 01:39:48.252
hitting Kima or you're hitting Grog.

01:39:48.252 --> 01:39:49.409
SAM: Oh shit.

01:39:49.409 --> 01:39:50.435
TALIESIN: Really?

01:39:50.435 --> 01:39:51.610
MATT: Yep.

01:39:51.610 --> 01:39:57.150
TRAVIS: I'm saying Kima's not actually attached to
a human being, just saying.

01:39:57.150 --> 01:39:59.283
TALIESIN: Kima's not short enough that it'll go
right over her head?

01:39:59.283 --> 01:40:06.147
MATT: Nope. As per the rules as designed, no.

01:40:06.147 --> 01:40:09.977
TRAVIS: I totally love Kima, I got nothing against
her. Just looking out for myself right now.

01:40:09.977 --> 01:40:15.208
MATT: She's parkouring off of the damaged wall,
trying to get into the fray with the dragon, and

01:40:15.208 --> 01:40:17.522
happens to catch where the bullet would be going.

01:40:17.522 --> 01:40:19.753
TALIESIN: Okay, that's happening, apparently.

01:40:19.753 --> 01:40:21.034
MARISHA: Are you shooting Kima?

01:40:21.034 --> 01:40:23.689
TALIESIN: It's either Kima or Grog. Although Grog
takes half damage.

01:40:23.689 --> 01:40:25.177
MATT: This is true.

01:40:25.177 --> 01:40:27.003
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay, come on.

01:40:27.003 --> 01:40:28.250
TALIESIN: You take half damage.

01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:29.738
TRAVIS: All right. I'll remember this later.

01:40:29.738 --> 01:40:31.742
MATT: So Grog it is? Roll for attack against
Grog.

01:40:31.742 --> 01:40:34.655
LAURA: I know, his head is so high. How are you
hitting Grog?

01:40:34.655 --> 01:40:36.782
TRAVIS: It's in the rules.

01:40:36.782 --> 01:40:37.951
TALIESIN: It's in the rules.

01:40:37.951 --> 01:40:43.641
MATT: In theory, from this angle, in to hit
the fire elemental and Thordak, he has to aim up.

01:40:43.641 --> 01:40:44.511
TALIESIN: 20.

01:40:44.511 --> 01:40:46.857
MATT: 20? Against Grog hits?

01:40:46.857 --> 01:40:48.011
TRAVIS: Yeah, it hits.

01:40:48.011 --> 01:40:49.606
MATT: And roll against Thordak.

01:40:49.606 --> 01:40:57.109
TALIESIN: And, no. I can't have a misfire once
I've already hit the first?

01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:58.597
MATT: Correct, only the additional attack can
misfire.

01:40:58.597 --> 01:41:00.124
TALIESIN: Okay. That's 15, that doesn't hit.

01:41:00.124 --> 01:41:01.085
SAM: So you only hit Grog.

01:41:01.085 --> 01:41:03.992
TALIESIN: I only hit Grog. No, I also hit the fire
elemental.

01:41:03.992 --> 01:41:05.508
MATT: Roll damage once.

01:41:05.508 --> 01:41:07.534
TALIESIN: Yeah, I hit the fire elemental, though.

01:41:07.534 --> 01:41:08.937
MARISHA: Maybe you'll kill it.

01:41:08.937 --> 01:41:13.284
TALIESIN: Maybe I will. Maybe it's Maybelline.
Where are my d12s, they seem to have all

01:41:13.284 --> 01:41:14.689
vanished.

01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:23.102
MARISHA: Kill it! Oh, jeez. Come on, man.

01:41:23.102 --> 01:41:25.531
TALIESIN: That's awful. 13 points of damage.

01:41:25.531 --> 01:41:33.082
MATT: Okay. Grog, you take 13 points of piercing
damage, halved to six. Round it down. Six.

01:41:33.082 --> 01:41:35.472
TALIESIN: Sorry! And the bullet gets lodged in
you.

01:41:35.472 --> 01:41:37.064
MATT: Yeah, basically.

01:41:37.064 --> 01:41:38.923
LIAM: It's there for 50 years.

01:41:38.923 --> 01:41:41.832
TALIESIN: Sorry! And then, is the fire elemental
still standing?

01:41:41.832 --> 01:41:43.127
MATT: Yes, it is.

01:41:43.127 --> 01:41:48.086
TALIESIN: I'm irritated. I'm burning another grit,
and I'm going to do a pushback on the elemental.

01:41:48.086 --> 01:42:00.814
That's actually no save, that's just a pushback. I
just have to hit. And that hits, I should have

01:42:00.814 --> 01:42:04.692
done a-- that's a 29, 32 to hit.

01:42:04.692 --> 01:42:09.415
MATT: 32 to hit. That'll hit, go ahead and roll
damage. And it just gets pushed back ten feet?

01:42:09.415 --> 01:42:11.144
TALIESIN: No, I'm saving you.

01:42:11.144 --> 01:42:14.539
MARISHA: I mean, I could have handled it.

01:42:14.539 --> 01:42:19.639
TALIESIN: 14. I want you to be able to get up
without that thing on you. 20 points of damage.

01:42:19.639 --> 01:42:27.073
And it gets pushed back ten feet. Thank you.

01:42:27.073 --> 01:42:31.141
MATT: Its form gets knocked back, coalesces again
as a flickering flame creature. It's looking hurt,

01:42:31.141 --> 01:42:34.448
it's barely keeping its form together at this
point, it's still standing.

01:42:34.448 --> 01:42:46.998
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus action for a
healing surge to add 22 points to my hit points.

01:42:46.998 --> 01:42:52.680
Then I'm going to keep running, use spider to run
over that wall into that little house beneath the

01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:54.025
green dragon.

01:42:54.025 --> 01:42:55.140
MATT: All right.

01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:56.886
LIAM: Spider-climb is cool.

01:42:56.886 --> 01:42:59.868
SAM: Little house on the prairie, with the dragon
on it.

01:42:59.868 --> 01:43:01.145
TALIESIN: There we go.

01:43:01.145 --> 01:43:06.933
MATT: All right. That finishes your turn, Percy.
Now you watch as the skyship Deera pushes through

01:43:06.933 --> 01:43:11.911
some of the clouds, and you can now see a series
of small shapes as it looks like a half-dozen

01:43:11.911 --> 01:43:17.684
wyverns are currently harrying it from the sky,
attacking it. You can see some sort of combat

01:43:17.684 --> 01:43:22.387
going on on the bow of the ship, but you also
watch as two of its arballists are set up, and

01:43:22.387 --> 01:43:32.596
fire towards Thordak. That actually hits. That's
cocked. And, yeah. A 16 and a 15. With bonus, it

01:43:32.596 --> 01:43:33.791
hits both.

01:43:33.791 --> 01:43:35.687
LAURA: That's Captain Damon, right? To the
rescue!

01:43:35.687 --> 01:43:40.643
MATT: So, they're both super-heated, they are
flaming arballists, fire doesn't have an effect,

01:43:40.643 --> 01:43:50.135
but they still do piercing damage, for a total of
22 points of piercing damage. You watch these two

01:43:50.135 --> 01:43:57.730
large, thick heavy metallic piercing bolts come
arcing through, slamming into Thordak's hide. The

01:43:57.730 --> 01:44:01.304
flames flicker on the edge where it impacted,
though it has little effect, and Thordak is

01:44:01.304 --> 01:44:03.966
(insane growling).

01:44:03.966 --> 01:44:05.240
TRAVIS: Crazy motherfucker.

01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:06.725
LAURA: He's so fucking crazy.

01:44:06.725 --> 01:44:10.469
MATT: (insane growling) (maniacal laughter)

01:44:10.469 --> 01:44:11.848
SAM: Oh, god.

01:44:11.848 --> 01:44:16.142
MATT: Two of the wyverns apparently, noticing the
fray, and peel off, beginning to make their way

01:44:16.142 --> 01:44:20.876
down to where this struggle is happening.

01:44:20.876 --> 01:44:23.532
SAM: No problem. (whispered) Big problem!

01:44:23.532 --> 01:44:26.006
LIAM: This is a busy battlefield.

01:44:26.006 --> 01:44:29.311
MATT: At this point in time, I'm going to do--

01:44:29.311 --> 01:44:32.226
TALIESIN: You're having way too much fun.

01:44:32.226 --> 01:44:33.788
MATT: Yeah. Okay.

01:44:33.788 --> 01:44:36.156
SAM: Matt has been waiting a year for this.

01:44:36.156 --> 01:44:38.407
LIAM: Don't worry, sir, we didn't see you playing
with your dolls.

01:44:38.407 --> 01:44:49.430
MATT: (laughs) Grog and Kima. Suddenly the ground
quakes beneath you, and it splits open, and a very

01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:56.800
thick, yellowish-green sulfurous gas just spills
out in the vicinity, immediately filling your

01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:01.298
lungs and causing your chest to seize just from
breathing the air in. I need both you and her to

01:45:01.298 --> 01:45:13.859
make a... The area is now heavily obscured, so now
there is a heavy smoke all in this area right now.

01:45:13.859 --> 01:45:16.278
LAURA: Does his head peek up above that?

01:45:16.278 --> 01:45:17.863
MATT: Yes, it does.

01:45:17.863 --> 01:45:19.607
LAURA: He's so tall.

01:45:19.607 --> 01:45:24.515
MATT: You don't do anything yet.

01:45:24.515 --> 01:45:26.128
TRAVIS: Nothing yet?

01:45:26.128 --> 01:45:27.542
MATT: You don't do anything yet.

01:45:27.542 --> 01:45:28.713
TRAVIS: On my turn.

01:45:28.713 --> 01:45:29.792
MATT: On your turn, you'll do it.

01:45:29.792 --> 01:45:31.642
SAM: Does that affect the fire elemental, too?

01:45:31.642 --> 01:45:32.821
MATT: It may.

01:45:32.821 --> 01:45:34.775
LAURA: You don't know.

01:45:34.775 --> 01:45:41.455
SAM: I don't. Sam Five has his theories, though.

01:45:41.455 --> 01:45:49.834
MATT: For Raishan's turn, as smoke has filled the
area, (coughing) you're having a hard time--

01:45:49.834 --> 01:45:55.743
Raishan sees this, picks up off the ground as the
wyvern begins to strike. First I'm going to see if

01:45:55.743 --> 01:46:03.129
her breath comes back. It does not. Seeing the new
creatures in the fray, is going to rush up and

01:46:03.129 --> 01:46:09.161
interfere with this one immediately, and just do a
full round of attacks against the wyvern.

01:46:09.161 --> 01:46:13.245
TRAVIS: (singing) Eat the little pterodactyl.

01:46:13.245 --> 01:46:34.004
MATT: That'll hit. That'll hit. That'll hit. Bite
and two claws. Yep. That wyvern is looking really

01:46:34.004 --> 01:46:38.000
hurt, as you watch as Raishan reaches up and just
tears into its side, and claws into its belly,

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.732
they're both wrestling in the air, almost in a
momentary freefall, then catch themselves again.

01:46:41.732 --> 01:46:45.782
Raishan just clings on. The wyvern is already in a
really, really bad place.

01:46:45.782 --> 01:46:47.285
SAM: Oh, that's great.

01:46:47.285 --> 01:46:58.639
MATT: That ends Raishan's turn. At the end of
Raishan's turn, Thordak is going to do another

01:46:58.639 --> 01:47:00.339
wing attack.

01:47:00.339 --> 01:47:05.395
LIAM: Man, Groggy. 17 displacer beasts just
appear.

01:47:05.395 --> 01:47:09.782
LAURA: Like, why would he add wyverns? For his own
sake!

01:47:09.782 --> 01:47:17.105
MATT: He's going to do another wing attack, at the
cost of two of its actions. Picking up the wind

01:47:17.105 --> 01:47:25.535
around it once more, I need Grog... Kima's just
out of the range, thankfully. Grog, I need you to

01:47:25.535 --> 01:47:27.471
make a dexterity saving throw.

01:47:27.471 --> 01:47:29.267
TRAVIS: I have advantage because of--

01:47:29.267 --> 01:47:30.536
MATT: You do.

01:47:30.536 --> 01:47:32.880
LAURA: Would the wings disperse the gas on the
ground?

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.401
MATT: Nope! But it does push it.

01:47:34.401 --> 01:47:36.042
LAURA: Damn it.

01:47:36.042 --> 01:47:37.326
MARISHA: Oh, boy.

01:47:37.326 --> 01:47:39.376
TRAVIS: 17.

01:47:39.376 --> 01:47:41.773
MATT: 17, nope. You take--

01:47:41.773 --> 01:47:43.130
LAURA: Oh, no!

01:47:43.130 --> 01:47:46.801
MATT: 16 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to
eight.

01:47:46.801 --> 01:47:47.973
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:47:47.973 --> 01:47:53.864
MATT: And you take eight points of fire damage,
reduced to four, from the impact, and you are

01:47:53.864 --> 01:48:04.625
knocked prone. So you are now prone on the ground.
And this gets pushed ever-so-slightly this way.

01:48:04.625 --> 01:48:06.168
TRAVIS: Off of me?

01:48:06.168 --> 01:48:14.971
MATT: Off of you, onto Keyleth, Pike, Kima,
currently. The dragon does shift.

01:48:14.971 --> 01:48:21.947
TALIESIN: Oh! No, Grog's down, so there's no
attack of opportunity.

01:48:21.947 --> 01:48:31.707
MATT: Keyleth, you're up. Initially, I need you to
make a constitution saving throw.

01:48:31.707 --> 01:48:39.446
MARISHA: Yeah, all right. Not that one, not that
one. Gil! Don't fuck me, Gil. All right, that's

01:48:39.446 --> 01:48:42.362
not too bad. 19.

01:48:42.362 --> 01:48:46.968
MATT: 19, you succeed. You manage to just hold
your breath, and the poison doesn't makes its way

01:48:46.968 --> 01:48:48.735
and fit into your lungs.

01:48:48.735 --> 01:48:51.738
MARISHA: So, I still have this asshole in front of
me, right?

01:48:51.738 --> 01:48:53.608
MATT: Yes, you do.

01:48:53.608 --> 01:48:55.125
MARISHA: But he's been pushed back?

01:48:55.125 --> 01:48:57.371
MATT: It's pushed back, yeah, so it's not in
contact with you.

01:48:57.371 --> 01:48:59.707
TALIESIN: Yeah, you got to see if you can get up
and walk away.

01:48:59.707 --> 01:49:03.010
MARISHA: Yeah, that's cool. I will stand up.

01:49:03.010 --> 01:49:04.499
MATT: Okay.

01:49:04.499 --> 01:49:18.372
MARISHA: Rise up! This guy in front of me is
almost dead, right?

01:49:18.372 --> 01:49:20.494
MATT: He's looking pretty rough, yeah.

01:49:20.494 --> 01:49:23.402
SAM: Focus on the dragon.

01:49:23.402 --> 01:49:25.986
TRAVIS: What was that?

01:49:25.986 --> 01:49:27.392
SAM: "Focus on the dragon."

01:49:27.392 --> 01:49:28.896
TRAVIS: "Focus on the dragon."

01:49:28.896 --> 01:49:32.898
MARISHA: How far away is Thordak from me?

01:49:32.898 --> 01:49:38.965
MATT: Quite a ways away. I'd say close to 65, 70
feet from you.

01:49:38.965 --> 01:49:56.687
MARISHA: Okay. I am going to-- Can I move up one
square closer to Thordak, but not get near the--

01:49:56.687 --> 01:49:58.718
MATT: Yeah, right there, you can.

01:49:58.718 --> 01:50:02.667
MARISHA: But I'm in this cloud, too! Shit.

01:50:02.667 --> 01:50:05.007
SAM: You have resistance to poison clouds,
remember?

01:50:05.007 --> 01:50:10.067
MARISHA: I don't, but that's nice. And now I'm
going to--

01:50:10.067 --> 01:50:12.126
MATT: You are immune to poison, just so you're
aware.

01:50:12.126 --> 01:50:13.192
MARISHA: Am I?

01:50:13.192 --> 01:50:14.612
MATT: Because of the Heroes' Feast.

01:50:14.612 --> 01:50:16.559
MARISHA: Oh, because of the Heroes' Feast! Oh,
that's right. Oh, well, fine.

01:50:16.559 --> 01:50:17.767
MATT: Thordak doesn't know that.

01:50:17.767 --> 01:50:22.688
MARISHA: Right. And then I'm going to cast Blight
on Thordak.

01:50:22.688 --> 01:50:28.590
MATT: Okay. Thordak's going to make a saving
throw. This is constitution?

01:50:28.590 --> 01:50:31.077
MARISHA: I think so?

01:50:31.077 --> 01:50:33.573
MATT: Success. So half damage.

01:50:33.573 --> 01:50:37.140
SAM: Success. Half damage. Hey, you caused damage!
That's great!

01:50:37.140 --> 01:51:01.843
MARISHA: I did! I did a thing! Not too bad. 11,
17, 21, 23, 25, 31, 35. 35, halved.

01:51:01.843 --> 01:51:10.011
MATT: Half of 35, all right. As the Blight spell
takes hold, you watch as the tendrils of black

01:51:10.011 --> 01:51:17.316
necrotic energy begin to carve between the scales
of Thordak's body. You watch as portions of the

01:51:17.316 --> 01:51:23.566
scar in the chest split, almost like a fresh
wound. A little bit of pus begins to pour forth.

01:51:23.566 --> 01:51:24.952
It's nasty.

01:51:24.952 --> 01:51:29.901
MARISHA: I take a few steps back. Can I tuck into
that little broken building, a little bit? Just

01:51:29.901 --> 01:51:32.377
inside the doorway?

01:51:32.377 --> 01:51:35.724
MATT: Sure. You are just inside the doorway right
now with Percy.

01:51:35.724 --> 01:51:36.952
MARISHA: Perfect.

01:51:36.952 --> 01:51:40.793
MATT: Actually, you can't quite get that far
because you were knocked prone, so you're just

01:51:40.793 --> 01:51:46.989
barely... No, you can just get in there, so you're
good.

01:51:46.989 --> 01:51:49.588
MARISHA: How are you doing?

01:51:49.588 --> 01:51:53.289
TALIESIN: I am just-- I am regretting so many
things right now.

01:51:53.289 --> 01:51:54.693
MARISHA: I don't know how we got here.

01:51:54.693 --> 01:51:59.214
TALIESIN: Neither do I. I should have saved him--

01:51:59.214 --> 01:52:01.956
MATT: Well, it is a 30-foot range.

01:52:01.956 --> 01:52:03.331
MARISHA: What?

01:52:03.331 --> 01:52:05.048
MATT: Blight has a 30-foot range.

01:52:05.048 --> 01:52:07.224
MARISHA: Oh. Hm. Yeah.

01:52:07.224 --> 01:52:11.014
MATT: So we're going to take that damage off.

01:52:11.014 --> 01:52:12.634
MARISHA: Okay. Well...

01:52:12.634 --> 01:52:14.973
SAM: Can we say that she walked 30 feet closer
to--

01:52:14.973 --> 01:52:17.489
MATT: No, because she was prone at the start of
her round, she can only move 15 feet.

01:52:17.489 --> 01:52:26.598
MARISHA: Okay. Well, then instead, (reverse
words), take me back. I can only do 15 feet. All

01:52:26.598 --> 01:52:31.177
right. How many feet am I from the elemental?

01:52:31.177 --> 01:52:34.786
MATT: He is 15 feet from you. Ten feet.

01:52:34.786 --> 01:52:36.645
SAM: You could have cast it on the--

01:52:36.645 --> 01:52:40.833
MARISHA: No, I'm not going to blow a 4th-level
spell on his ass. I'm going to do a 1st-level

01:52:40.833 --> 01:52:42.897
spell, though, and do a Thunderwave.

01:52:42.897 --> 01:52:48.960
MATT: Okay. So in that right there. What level,
you're going to do first level?

01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:50.354
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:52:50.354 --> 01:52:54.778
MATT: Okay. That is a, what save? Constitution?

01:52:54.778 --> 01:52:56.616
MARISHA: Yes.

01:52:56.616 --> 01:53:03.166
MATT: That is a 17, so it does not succeed, I
don't think.

01:53:03.166 --> 01:53:08.587
MARISHA: It does not. It takes 2d8. Ooh, that's
good! Ten damage! Please kill it, please kill it!

01:53:08.587 --> 01:53:11.597
SAM: Does my hand need to make a save, as well?

01:53:11.597 --> 01:53:15.028
MATT: No, because she aimed the-- It's a cone,
right?

01:53:15.028 --> 01:53:16.726
MARISHA: It's a radius.

01:53:16.726 --> 01:53:18.635
MATT: Radius? So yeah, your hand would have to--

01:53:18.635 --> 01:53:22.968
MARISHA: Oh, no, sorry. It's a cube. It's a cube,
15-foot cube.

01:53:22.968 --> 01:53:30.496
MATT: Yeah, so you can just go right there. You're
fine. As you get up off the ground, the smoke, you

01:53:30.496 --> 01:53:34.941
slam your staff into the ground. The smoke around
you dissipates momentarily as the shockwave hits

01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:39.713
the fire elemental. It just turns into ash, and
vanishes.

01:53:39.713 --> 01:53:44.045
MARISHA: Got rid of that fucking asshole. All
right. And that's all I can do.

01:53:44.045 --> 01:53:46.875
MATT: You have 15 feet you can move.

01:53:46.875 --> 01:53:50.098
MARISHA: Okay, now I'll tuck into there.

01:53:50.098 --> 01:53:53.736
MATT: Now you can tuck in, yeah. Since you did
move that time. There you go.

01:53:53.736 --> 01:53:56.232
TRAVIS, MARISHA: There you go!

01:53:56.232 --> 01:54:08.170
MATT: At the end of Keyleth's turn, Raishan's
going to use a legendary action to make another

01:54:08.170 --> 01:54:15.834
attack against the wyvern. That will hit. And that
will do it. With that, the wyvern gets its head

01:54:15.834 --> 01:54:20.753
ripped off by Raishan. The body plummets, the
lizardman that was riding it ends up falling off.

01:54:20.753 --> 01:54:26.354
Slams into the ground.

01:54:26.354 --> 01:54:27.693
TRAVIS: Wilhelm scream!

01:54:27.693 --> 01:54:29.789
MARISHA, TALIESIN: (half-hearted Wilhelm scream)

01:54:29.789 --> 01:54:34.764
TALIESIN: I've got shit to do in the morning, I'm
not going to do it for real.

01:54:34.764 --> 01:54:35.933
TRAVIS: All right, fair enough.

01:54:35.933 --> 01:54:41.727
MATT: Nine points of bludgeoning damage, as it
hits the ground. It's still alive, but it's

01:54:41.727 --> 01:54:49.615
looking up at this green dragon. That ends
Keyleth's turn. Jarett is currently afraid as shit.

01:54:49.615 --> 01:54:54.161
TRAVIS: (laughs) Because he rolled not very good.

01:54:54.161 --> 01:54:59.222
MATT: He's going to reload, and look over. He has
to roll with disadvantage against Thordak from

01:54:59.222 --> 01:55:05.757
that distance, can't get closer. Even with
disadvantage, hits, on the first attack. With 16

01:55:05.757 --> 01:55:08.007
and 18. Misses with the second one.

01:55:08.007 --> 01:55:09.376
TRAVIS: Crossbow?

01:55:09.376 --> 01:55:14.339
MATT: Yeah, with the crossbow. Still manages to do
13 points of piercing damage. To Thordak, which is

01:55:14.339 --> 01:55:22.690
nice. Jarett is then going to finish moving out of
visual sight of this, like, "Nope, nope, nope!"

01:55:22.690 --> 01:55:29.077
Behind the wall, (panting) "This is, uh. This is a
terrible idea. They're not paying me enough for this."

01:55:29.077 --> 01:55:33.619
TALIESIN: He's not going to take a shot at the
elemental while he's running away?

01:55:33.619 --> 01:55:40.530
MATT: No, he was focused on Thordak. He was just
like, (yells). That ends Jarett's turn. Gilmore's

01:55:40.530 --> 01:55:48.904
turn. Gilmore is dodging out of the outside of the
cloud, and goes, "All right. Let's see if we can

01:55:48.904 --> 01:55:52.747
"try this again." He's going to go ahead and move
up into the building just outside of the radius.

01:55:52.747 --> 01:55:54.251
TRAVIS: Come on, buddy.

01:55:54.251 --> 01:55:58.523
MATT: Looking behind where the window is busted
open, he's going to blow his one 7th-level spell

01:55:58.523 --> 01:56:04.078
as a lower-level spell of Disintegrate once more
up towards the chest, where it's kind of cracked

01:56:04.078 --> 01:56:15.314
open. That is a 24, 13 plus 11, that hits.

01:56:15.314 --> 01:56:18.359
TRAVIS: Boom! Nobody else is excited about this?

01:56:18.359 --> 01:56:20.577
LAURA: I am. I am very excited.

01:56:20.577 --> 01:56:24.793
TALIESIN: Once I hear a number, I'll be excited.
I'm not saying anything until I hear a number.

01:56:24.793 --> 01:56:29.383
It's going to be, like, 11 points of
damage.

01:56:29.383 --> 01:56:31.748
TRAVIS: 7th-level Disintegrate.

01:56:31.748 --> 01:56:39.401
MATT: That's an additional 3d6 to that. That's
13d6

01:56:39.401 --> 01:56:40.895
ALL: Oh!

01:56:40.895 --> 01:56:43.217
MATT: Plus 40 points of force damage.

01:56:43.217 --> 01:56:44.535
ALL: Whoa!

01:56:44.535 --> 01:56:47.610
LAURA: 13d6.

01:56:47.610 --> 01:56:48.814
TRAVIS: Now y'all are excited!

01:56:48.814 --> 01:56:50.566
TALIESIN: Now we're on board.

01:56:50.566 --> 01:56:52.433
TRAVIS: I'm with you, Gilmore, I'm a true fan,
OG!

01:56:52.433 --> 01:56:54.486
MATT: So it deals 88 points of damage to Thordak.

01:56:54.486 --> 01:56:56.582
(cheering)

01:56:56.582 --> 01:57:04.379
MATT: You watch as the beam slams right into the
side of Thordak's shoulder and torso area, the

01:57:04.379 --> 01:57:12.593
beam firing out from behind the broken wall. The
wings extend as he's bearing down on Vax, and as

01:57:12.593 --> 01:57:18.751
it hits, the flesh kind of peels away and turns to
dust in the vicinity. (pained roar) You can see

01:57:18.751 --> 01:57:25.089
he's just reeling from the pain, the mouth opens
wide, the eyes go wide, as it begins to curl

01:57:25.089 --> 01:57:30.048
across. As it does, you see it. There's a bit of
bone exposed there where the flesh once was. You

01:57:30.048 --> 01:57:37.311
can see scar removed and pulled back. You can see
on the inside of the ribcage, just barely exposed,

01:57:37.311 --> 01:57:41.641
the outside of a glistening red crystal that is
embedded in Thordak's chest.

01:57:41.641 --> 01:57:43.112
SAM: He does have it.

01:57:43.112 --> 01:57:44.505
LAURA: It was just covered.

01:57:44.505 --> 01:57:45.956
TRAVIS: The skin's grown over it.

01:57:45.956 --> 01:57:49.485
LAURA: And it's being absorbed, so I'm not going
to get it.

01:57:49.485 --> 01:57:57.092
MATT: That is the end of Gilmore's turn. That
brings us to Grog and Thordak.

01:57:57.092 --> 01:57:59.106
TRAVIS: Would you like to go first?

01:57:59.106 --> 01:58:07.102
MATT: First let me see-- This roll is going to--
Yes. I would like to go first.

01:58:07.102 --> 01:58:08.389
LAURA, SAM: Oh, no.

01:58:08.389 --> 01:58:12.019
LAURA: He just got his fire breath back.

01:58:12.019 --> 01:58:18.972
MATT: After getting disintegrated, Thordak, who
was focused on you, his attention keeps shifting

01:58:18.972 --> 01:58:26.631
from place to place. He's not focused in his
current mental state. (enraged roar) And you watch

01:58:26.631 --> 01:58:34.350
as he heaves, you see the flames flickering
brighter and brighter across him. (fwoosh)

01:58:34.350 --> 01:58:37.392
SAM: Oh, god. No.

01:58:37.392 --> 01:58:38.863
MATT: Or actually, he'd be right there.

01:58:38.863 --> 01:58:40.458
LAURA, SAM, TALIESIN: No!

01:58:40.458 --> 01:58:43.886
MATT: You do get an attack of opportunity against
him.

01:58:43.886 --> 01:58:45.390
LIAM: Yeah. Sneak attack, on top of that.

01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:47.555
MATT: Yeah, because you have advantage, if you
hit. So go ahead and roll twice.

01:58:47.555 --> 01:58:54.067
LIAM: Got him, got him. That's 26 plus... is 27.

01:58:54.067 --> 01:58:56.337
MATT: 27 hits. Go ahead and roll damage with the
sneak attack.

01:58:56.337 --> 01:58:57.770
TALIESIN: Are you using the sword?

01:58:57.770 --> 01:58:59.389
LIAM: Yep. Yes, I am using the sword.

01:58:59.389 --> 01:59:00.986
TALIESIN: Yes, you are. Love it.

01:59:00.986 --> 01:59:16.473
LIAM: Yes, where is my ten-sided die? Ten plus six
is 16. Plus all of this shit. 16, 17, 23, 29, 33,

01:59:16.473 --> 01:59:26.706
34, 38, 42, plus Hunter's Mark. 43.

01:59:26.706 --> 01:59:28.620
LAURA: Plus 3d6 for your dragon.

01:59:28.620 --> 01:59:29.798
LIAM: I already did that.

01:59:29.798 --> 01:59:31.047
LAURA: No, you didn't.

01:59:31.047 --> 01:59:38.533
LIAM: Correct. 43, thank you. 49. 50. 51.

01:59:38.533 --> 01:59:46.368
MATT: 51 points of damage as Thordak rushes away
from you. (pained roar) As you cleave across his

01:59:46.368 --> 01:59:53.020
underside, you watch as the blood just spills out.
(wings flapping, hard landing) Actually, no, he's

01:59:53.020 --> 01:59:54.757
not going to land, he's staying up in the air.

01:59:54.757 --> 02:00:00.596
LAURA: There's no plastic big enough to support
him!

02:00:00.596 --> 02:00:04.077
TRAVIS: Yeah, he ate too much, he can't get up in
the air!

02:00:04.077 --> 02:00:05.506
LAURA: He's too fat to fly!

02:00:05.506 --> 02:00:07.664
LIAM: Too many Krispy Kremes.

02:00:07.664 --> 02:00:09.857
MATT: Thordak is currently up--

02:00:09.857 --> 02:00:11.226
LAURA: Oh shit, he's high.

02:00:11.226 --> 02:00:12.520
TRAVIS: You just hit Grog.

02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:14.059
MATT: I did, yeah. Hold on a sec.

02:00:14.059 --> 02:00:17.195
TRAVIS: He does not appreciate that.

02:00:17.195 --> 02:00:18.985
MATT: Grog will calm down.

02:00:18.985 --> 02:00:23.029
LIAM: Here's Jenga, right here, that dragon's
coming down. Holy cow.

02:00:23.029 --> 02:00:25.227
LAURA: Oh, my. There's rocks, it's on the rocks.

02:00:25.227 --> 02:00:26.936
LIAM: It's like Mousetrap. Holy cow.

02:00:26.936 --> 02:00:31.058
LAURA: Oh my god. Grog!

02:00:31.058 --> 02:00:32.867
LIAM: Oh my gosh!

02:00:32.867 --> 02:00:34.831
LAURA: He's too big to fly, we told you!

02:00:34.831 --> 02:00:36.925
LIAM: We'll use the theater of the mind, Matt!

02:00:36.925 --> 02:00:44.451
TRAVIS: One little bump of that table, and it's
falling down.

02:00:44.451 --> 02:00:51.348
LAURA: It's all coming down. It's like he's going
to knock over everything when comes down.

02:00:51.348 --> 02:00:58.652
MATT: He's going to fire breath. That's going to
be Grog, Kima, Pike, and Gilmore.

02:00:58.652 --> 02:01:01.468
SAM: And the hand.

02:01:01.468 --> 02:01:03.304
MATT: And the hand.

02:01:03.304 --> 02:01:06.460
TRAVIS: I really don't want that to fall. It's
going to break.

02:01:06.460 --> 02:01:12.793
MATT: So I need Grog and Pike to roll a dexterity
saving throw.

02:01:12.793 --> 02:01:21.863
TRAVIS: All right. Come on, come on, Gil. Yes.
Even better! 21.

02:01:21.863 --> 02:01:23.531
MATT: That's still not enough.

02:01:23.531 --> 02:01:25.075
LAURA: Pike rolled a ten.

02:01:25.075 --> 02:01:26.861
TRAVIS: That was a 19.

02:01:26.861 --> 02:01:34.996
SAM: The hand rolled a nine.

02:01:34.996 --> 02:01:41.615
LAURA: Oh, wait, does she get-- Wait. No.

02:01:41.615 --> 02:01:52.175
MATT: That's 102 points of fire damage. Halved,
for both of you, so 51 points of fire damage. No,

02:01:52.175 --> 02:01:58.169
no, to both of you! So 51 points of fire damage to
Grog, and Pike. Pike needs to make a constitution

02:01:58.169 --> 02:02:01.909
saving throw to try and maintain concentration.

02:02:01.909 --> 02:02:03.310
LIAM: 19.

02:02:03.310 --> 02:02:05.326
MATT: What's her constitution save?

02:02:05.326 --> 02:02:08.577
LIAM: Her modifier, so, a total of 20.

02:02:08.577 --> 02:02:16.014
MATT: Not enough. So-- It's half the damage you
take. She had to roll a natural 20. She probably

02:02:16.014 --> 02:02:23.720
couldn't have made it, yeah. So Beacon of Hope is
gone. Beacon of Hope is gone. You took 51 points.

02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:25.436
TRAVIS: I took the 51.

02:02:25.436 --> 02:02:28.119
LAURA: Right when she needs it the most! (shriek)

02:02:28.119 --> 02:02:34.510
MATT: Kima rolls a natural 20 on her save, so she
takes half damage, at least, so Kima's still up!

02:02:34.510 --> 02:02:37.531
LAURA: If we hadn't had that Heroes' Feast, Pike
would be unconscious.

02:02:37.531 --> 02:02:40.984
MATT: Kima does not maintain her spell,
unfortunately.

02:02:40.984 --> 02:02:42.827
LAURA: Pike is way low.

02:02:42.827 --> 02:02:44.793
LIAM: Pike is going to be looking out for Pike on
her next turn.

02:02:44.793 --> 02:02:46.511
TALIESIN: That's cool.

02:02:46.511 --> 02:02:49.853
LIAM: Got to have that ray of sunshine, man.

02:02:49.853 --> 02:02:55.007
MATT: Gilmore rolls a natural 20 on his reflex
save.

02:02:55.007 --> 02:02:56.374
EVERYONE: Yes!

02:02:56.374 --> 02:03:07.858
MATT: That's awesome. And thank god, so he's still
unconscious. Gilmore is down and in flames right now.

02:03:07.858 --> 02:03:09.433
SAM: Oh, god.

02:03:09.433 --> 02:03:11.256
TRAVIS: Wait, Gilmore is down, and is
unconscious?

02:03:11.256 --> 02:03:12.671
MATT: Unconscious.

02:03:12.671 --> 02:03:14.736
SAM: Oh shit. I got him.

02:03:14.736 --> 02:03:20.563
TRAVIS: How high is Thordak in the air?

02:03:20.563 --> 02:03:24.490
MATT: Thordak is 50 feet up.

02:03:24.490 --> 02:03:33.253
TRAVIS: Sam. What are you going to do?

02:03:33.253 --> 02:03:37.601
SAM: I'm going to not let him die?

02:03:37.601 --> 02:03:43.068
TRAVIS: Okay. Is somebody planning to go into the
fucking tunnel, on the earring?

02:03:43.068 --> 02:03:45.670
LAURA: Wha-- why?

02:03:45.670 --> 02:03:47.832
TRAVIS: Because I can't hit him. He's too high.

02:03:47.832 --> 02:03:50.433
LAURA: But he's-- There's crystals in his belly.

02:03:50.433 --> 02:03:56.153
TRAVIS: But wasn't there a tunnel that we wanted?
I attach the Bloodaxe to the Chain of Returning

02:03:56.153 --> 02:03:57.783
and I throw it at his feet.

02:03:57.783 --> 02:04:00.726
MATT: Okay. So you stand up.

02:04:00.726 --> 02:04:09.561
TRAVIS: Let me move 20 feet to his right rear,
over here. Just in case he decides to do the Cone

02:04:09.561 --> 02:04:11.444
of Fuck Everything again.

02:04:11.444 --> 02:04:13.480
(laughter)

02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:15.292
TRAVIS: Then I'll throw the axe.

02:04:15.292 --> 02:04:16.893
MATT: Okay.

02:04:16.893 --> 02:04:24.985
TRAVIS: Reckless! 29.

02:04:24.985 --> 02:04:26.802
MATT: 29 hits.

02:04:26.802 --> 02:04:40.201
TRAVIS: Hey, that's a 12, that's great. Sorry, I'm
blanking out. 25, 27, plus the 1d4 because I'm

02:04:40.201 --> 02:04:43.941
enlarged, which I didn't do last time. That's 30.

02:04:43.941 --> 02:04:49.531
MATT: 30 points of damage. Good.

02:04:49.531 --> 02:04:58.933
TRAVIS: And I need to roll a DC of 14 to bring it
back in, but it's strength.

02:04:58.933 --> 02:05:00.819
MATT: Go ahead and roll.

02:05:00.819 --> 02:05:06.964
TRAVIS: That's too wild. That's off the wall.
That's a 12. That's off the wall. God, nipples on

02:05:06.964 --> 02:05:09.592
a horse! Wait, do I have advantage?

02:05:09.592 --> 02:05:14.420
MATT: While you're raging, you have advantage on
strength rolls. Was it athletics or strength?

02:05:14.420 --> 02:05:17.119
TRAVIS: Strength. Advantage on strength checks,
strength saves.

02:05:17.119 --> 02:05:18.625
MATT: So, roll again.

02:05:18.625 --> 02:05:20.032
TRAVIS: 19.

02:05:20.032 --> 02:05:26.314
MATT: You yank the axe back down, catch it in your
hands. You did the extra 1d4 damage from being

02:05:26.314 --> 02:05:27.447
enlarged, right?

02:05:27.447 --> 02:05:29.344
TRAVIS: I did. It's that little tiny one.

02:05:29.344 --> 02:05:40.920
MATT: That is going to end Thordak's turn. Now it
is the elemental over here. It's going to

02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:43.999
(flame crackling) over next to Percy.

02:05:43.999 --> 02:05:52.421
TRAVIS: Ooh! Is the Second Wind a bonus action?
Second Wind, the fighter thing?

02:05:52.421 --> 02:05:54.592
MATT: That's a bonus action.

02:05:54.592 --> 02:05:55.772
TRAVIS: Can I do that?

02:05:55.772 --> 02:05:57.284
MATT: Yeah. Go for it.

02:05:57.284 --> 02:05:58.912
TRAVIS: 1d10 plus fighter level, which is one.

02:05:58.912 --> 02:06:00.577
MATT: 1d10 plus one.

02:06:00.577 --> 02:06:03.905
TRAVIS: Nine. Ten! Ten hit points.

02:06:03.905 --> 02:06:17.848
MATT: Ten hit points, all right. All righty. Let's
see. Vex, you're up.

02:06:17.848 --> 02:06:33.114
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to shoot him. I'm going to
reach back and I'm going to get a poison arrow.

02:06:33.114 --> 02:06:35.840
MATT: It's your third and final poison arrow?

02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:39.041
LAURA: No, I've got six poison arrows. That one
missed.

02:06:39.041 --> 02:06:44.907
MATT: It just barely misses Raishan on the way.

02:06:44.907 --> 02:06:53.920
LAURA: Sorry! Poison arrow. No, it's okay, it's
good. That is a 27.

02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:55.713
MATT: That hits.

02:06:55.713 --> 02:07:16.025
LAURA: 15 plus four lightning. Does he have
anybody near him? Does he see me? Am I sneak

02:07:16.025 --> 02:07:17.159
attacking?

02:07:17.159 --> 02:07:19.140
TRAVIS: He's in the middle of the motherfucking
sky.

02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:21.324
MATT: You're not sneak attacking because nobody
nearby can hit him.

02:07:21.324 --> 02:07:30.388
LAURA: Plus four because that's two for being a
dragon. Okay, so you know. And then the poison

02:07:30.388 --> 02:07:31.682
arrow thing.

02:07:31.682 --> 02:07:33.442
MATT: Right. He makes his save.

02:07:33.442 --> 02:07:43.618
LAURA: My last attack. I'm going to try using my
last dragon-slaying arrow that I have.

02:07:43.618 --> 02:07:51.798
MATT: Okay! This is the one you've had. This is
the one you've kept this whole time, right?

02:07:51.798 --> 02:07:55.216
LAURA: It's got Thordak's name on it.

02:07:55.216 --> 02:07:57.912
MATT: You reach back and you pull and there's
two.

02:07:57.912 --> 02:07:59.454
LAURA: There's two?

02:07:59.454 --> 02:08:01.077
MATT: There's two in there.

02:08:01.077 --> 02:08:02.678
LIAM: Do it.

02:08:02.678 --> 02:08:05.620
LAURA: Why do I have two?

02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:10.759
MATT: You pull one out, look, and there's a small
piece of paper attached to it.

02:08:10.759 --> 02:08:25.142
LAURA: Ooh! I rip it off and tuck it in my shirt.
Pull. 21? No!

02:08:25.142 --> 02:08:29.555
MATT: It arcs into the darkness, past the clouds
and out of the Cloudtop.

02:08:29.555 --> 02:08:34.061
LAURA: Goddamn it.

02:08:34.061 --> 02:08:37.153
TRAVIS: It's okay!

02:08:37.153 --> 02:08:40.138
MATT: You still have movement if you want to do
something else.

02:08:40.138 --> 02:08:42.660
LAURA: Is the building on fire?

02:08:42.660 --> 02:08:47.529
MATT: There's small flames here and there, but
there is a wyvern up above the wall now that seems

02:08:47.529 --> 02:08:50.213
to have noticed you as you went around the corner
and fired a few arrows.

02:08:50.213 --> 02:08:57.091
LAURA: Can I use my bonus to hide? From him?

02:08:57.091 --> 02:09:02.634
MATT: You don't have anything to hide behind. It
notices you over the side. You can move, if you

02:09:02.634 --> 02:09:04.424
want to, and try to do that.

02:09:04.424 --> 02:09:09.259
LAURA: The building is on fire? Can I move and try
to duck into the building? I see a hole that's not

02:09:09.259 --> 02:09:10.363
on fire.

02:09:10.363 --> 02:09:12.950
MATT: You could move around here and duck inside
there.

02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:17.660
LAURA: Yeah. I'll try to hide in the building
because wyverns, he's so dumb.

02:09:17.660 --> 02:09:21.626
MATT: Go ahead and roll stealth.

02:09:21.626 --> 02:09:25.529
LAURA: How about that? That is a 14.

02:09:25.529 --> 02:09:32.950
MATT: That's a 14? All righty. I forgot to do the
fire elemental attacks against you, Percival,

02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:34.185
from earlier.

02:09:34.185 --> 02:09:35.919
TALIESIN: I had an environmental attack?

02:09:35.919 --> 02:09:39.527
MATT: Fire elemental attack that came over there
and attacked you. It was during Thordak's turn; I

02:09:39.527 --> 02:09:45.168
forgot to do that. It gets two touch attacks
against you. That is 13.

02:09:45.168 --> 02:09:46.929
TALIESIN: That does not hit.

02:09:46.929 --> 02:09:49.605
MATT: That's cocked. Natural 20.

02:09:49.605 --> 02:09:51.122
TALIESIN: That hits.

02:09:51.122 --> 02:09:53.917
TRAVIS: Yes! Oh. Not your natural 20.

02:09:53.917 --> 02:09:57.694
TALIESIN: Yeah, not mine.

02:09:57.694 --> 02:10:04.062
MATT: 17 points of fire damage, halved to eight,
and you are on fire.

02:10:04.062 --> 02:10:06.890
TALIESIN: Yeah, oh.

02:10:06.890 --> 02:10:09.167
TRAVIS: And you are on fire.

02:10:09.167 --> 02:10:10.939
TALIESIN: Does stop, drop and roll work in--

02:10:10.939 --> 02:10:16.603
MATT: You have to use an action to get rid of it.
So yes. And every turn, you'll take 1d10 fire

02:10:16.603 --> 02:10:24.512
damage until you get rid of it. All right, so,
finishing Vex's turn, it is now Vax and Kima's.

02:10:24.512 --> 02:10:29.538
Kima's going to make a constitution saving throw.
Kima makes it and is unaffected. Well, she's

02:10:29.538 --> 02:10:31.666
unaffected by the poison anyway because she was
part of the Heroes' Feast.

02:10:31.666 --> 02:10:35.383
LAURA: Oh, right, that's poison. So she's immune.

02:10:35.383 --> 02:10:42.571
MATT: Yeah, Kima is angrily going to rush over to
Gilmore.

02:10:42.571 --> 02:10:44.351
SAM: (pouring drink)

02:10:44.351 --> 02:10:46.455
MARISHA: It's never not weird.

02:10:46.455 --> 02:10:48.532
SAM: (contented sigh)

02:10:48.532 --> 02:10:53.294
LIAM: It's really on Matt for there being no pee
break.

02:10:53.294 --> 02:11:00.957
MATT: It's true. It's true. Kima is going to go ahead
and Lay Hands on Gilmore.

02:11:00.957 --> 02:11:02.838
MARISHA: Oh yeah, Kima.

02:11:02.838 --> 02:11:16.975
MATT: She's going to heal him for 35. All righty,
so as Kima rushes over, still staring at Thordak

02:11:16.975 --> 02:11:24.118
up in the air, (wing flapping) she hand vaults
over the destroyed wall, runs over to Gilmore's

02:11:24.118 --> 02:11:29.391
unconscious burning form and, moving her hand out
of the way to put the flames out, pats him down

02:11:29.391 --> 02:11:34.040
and as her hand glows and she slams onto his chest
and you watch (gasping) the breath come to him.

02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:39.634
As his eyes flicker open, she goes, "It's not your
time yet, buddy." Picks up her sword and angrily

02:11:39.634 --> 02:11:45.125
looks over towards Thordak again. She can move
five more feet that way, that's as much as she can

02:11:45.125 --> 02:11:50.773
get this turn. But that's her action. Pike's
turn.

02:11:50.773 --> 02:11:52.204
LIAM: Vax's turn.

02:11:52.204 --> 02:11:53.665
MATT: Sorry, Vax's turn.

02:11:53.665 --> 02:12:02.311
LIAM: I'm going to fly straight at Thordak's
flank. You can put me, well, don't actually put me

02:12:02.311 --> 02:12:03.699
there, because he'll topple.

02:12:03.699 --> 02:12:05.172
MATT: Yeah, but you're up there.

02:12:05.172 --> 02:12:08.368
LIAM: But I'm going to attack twice, once with the
dragonslayer sword, once with Whisper, so here's

02:12:08.368 --> 02:12:10.360
the dragonslayer sword. Natural 20!

02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:12.395
(cheering)

02:12:12.395 --> 02:12:13.902
LIAM: Sneak attack damage!

02:12:13.902 --> 02:12:20.739
MATT: Okay. So you have the sword and Whisper
both attuned?

02:12:20.739 --> 02:12:22.310
LIAM: Yeah. But this is the sword.

02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:23.897
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

02:12:23.897 --> 02:12:29.213
LAURA: He's going to use a legendary. I can see it
on his damn face.

02:12:29.213 --> 02:12:30.826
LIAM: He can't against damage, can he?

02:12:30.826 --> 02:12:32.980
LIAM: All right, well, here we go.

02:12:32.980 --> 02:12:34.649
MATT: Can't legendary resist against damage.

02:12:34.649 --> 02:12:35.704
LAURA: You can't?

02:12:35.704 --> 02:12:37.379
MATT: No, it's only against saving throws.

02:12:37.379 --> 02:12:43.002
LIAM: Yeah. So seven. I'll save the bonus for
later. Seven plus the three.

02:12:43.002 --> 02:12:44.841
SAM: Roll high. Roll strong.

02:12:44.841 --> 02:12:59.458
LIAM: Seven, eight, 14, 18, 18 plus all of this.
And I'm smiting, by the way. 18, 21, 24, 26, 30,

02:12:59.458 --> 02:13:16.823
32, 35, 39 plus Hunter's Mark is 42, plus Divine
Smite-- 46. 48 times two is 96.

02:13:16.823 --> 02:13:18.349
MATT: Without the bonus.

02:13:18.349 --> 02:13:21.430
LIAM: Without the bonus, so a hundred and...
two.

02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:24.238
MATT: 102 points of damage against Thordak.

02:13:24.238 --> 02:13:26.124
LAURA: On your first attack!

02:13:26.124 --> 02:13:37.042
LIAM: For the second attack-- good, this is, yeah,
it hits, 16 plus, 20, 20, 25. This is Whisper, so

02:13:37.042 --> 02:13:41.642
that is one plus-- is nine plus psychic damage...

02:13:41.642 --> 02:13:44.404
LAURA: Can't you just attack twice with the dragon
sword?

02:13:44.404 --> 02:13:45.515
LIAM: No.

02:13:45.515 --> 02:13:46.621
LAURA: Why not?

02:13:46.621 --> 02:13:47.817
LIAM: Hand, hand.

02:13:47.817 --> 02:13:48.702
LAURA: Oh.

02:13:48.702 --> 02:13:50.095
LIAM: 16 for Whisper.

02:13:50.095 --> 02:13:51.135
MATT: All righty.

02:13:51.135 --> 02:13:56.487
LIAM: And I will use my last action, so that was
action, bonus action-- last action to disengage

02:13:56.487 --> 02:14:05.808
and fly down and land by Kima and Gilmore, this
side of the building. Closest to me.

02:14:05.808 --> 02:14:07.312
MATT: Right here?

02:14:07.312 --> 02:14:13.016
LIAM: On the ground, even, if I can, yeah. Behind
the column in the corner by Gilmore's head, I think.

02:14:13.016 --> 02:14:23.534
MATT: Okay. So as you rush up, sword at the side,
jam it to the hilt to the side of Thordak's

02:14:23.534 --> 02:14:30.667
haunch and upper torso area, using the momentum
behind you, you continue to push forward and yank

02:14:30.667 --> 02:14:39.238
the blade around like a can opener. Just cutting
through the scales and hide. (pained yelling) And

02:14:39.238 --> 02:14:45.272
as you tear through, the blade, it comes out the
other side, cutting through the flesh as you spin

02:14:45.272 --> 02:14:51.436
around with your wings still out in front, you
spin with Whisper and slam it into the open wound

02:14:51.436 --> 02:14:57.221
with the exposed crystal, hitting the crystal with
the Vestige. (shattering) There's a flash of

02:14:57.221 --> 02:15:02.270
light, and you continue downward, landing off to
that side. As you turn around and look up, you

02:15:02.270 --> 02:15:04.810
watch as the crystal begins to crack.
(shattering)

02:15:04.810 --> 02:15:06.113
(gasping)

02:15:06.113 --> 02:15:07.743
SAM: It's got a weak spot. Weak spot.

02:15:07.743 --> 02:15:08.795
MARISHA: Oh shit.

02:15:08.795 --> 02:15:10.174
LIAM: Pretty sure I just had an orgasm.

02:15:10.174 --> 02:15:11.495
(laughter)

02:15:11.495 --> 02:15:14.478
SAM: In game, or right here?

02:15:14.478 --> 02:15:16.468
TALIESIN: Could be both now, actually.

02:15:16.468 --> 02:15:18.182
(laughter)

02:15:18.182 --> 02:15:22.854
MATT: All right. That's your turn.

02:15:22.854 --> 02:15:24.434
SAM: You've done your thing.

02:15:24.434 --> 02:15:29.677
LIAM: Take it, take it. Pike cheat sheet, here we
are.

02:15:29.677 --> 02:15:31.089
LAURA: Pike cheat sheet.

02:15:31.089 --> 02:15:37.711
MATT: All righty, that brings us to Pike's turn.

02:15:37.711 --> 02:15:39.746
LAURA: Pike.

02:15:39.746 --> 02:15:42.784
MATT: Pike has to make-- nothing because of the
poison.

02:15:42.784 --> 02:15:43.969
LAURA: Heroes' Feast?

02:15:43.969 --> 02:15:45.345
MATT: Yeah, so, what's Pike doing?

02:15:45.345 --> 02:15:50.478
LAURA: Pike is going to cast Heal on herself at
seventh level. So she's going to heal herself for

02:15:50.478 --> 02:15:51.509
80 points.

02:15:51.509 --> 02:15:52.565
MATT: Okay.

02:15:52.565 --> 02:15:57.512
LAURA: So she's got 84 points now.

02:15:57.512 --> 02:15:59.732
LIAM: She was low.

02:15:59.732 --> 02:16:01.512
LAURA: She was super low.

02:16:01.512 --> 02:16:06.352
TALIESIN: She can take a death, remember. She can
actually take a death. But yeah.

02:16:06.352 --> 02:16:11.964
LAURA: Okay, but then she can't heal people. And
then is anybody injured around her?

02:16:11.964 --> 02:16:14.437
SAM: Everybody's injured around her.

02:16:14.437 --> 02:16:15.947
LAURA: Gilmore's still pretty low, right?

02:16:15.947 --> 02:16:17.484
MATT: Gilmore's not too great.

02:16:17.484 --> 02:16:26.908
LAURA: Okay, then she's going to run, she's going
to cast Healing Word on Gilmore.

02:16:26.908 --> 02:16:28.689
MATT: Okay, he's within range.

02:16:28.689 --> 02:16:30.870
LAURA: At second level that she can do it at?

02:16:30.870 --> 02:16:33.048
MATT: Right, so that's 2d4 plus five.

02:16:33.048 --> 02:16:34.852
LAURA: So that's, oh, right, because now shit's
gone.

02:16:34.852 --> 02:16:36.259
MATT: Yeah, Beacon of Hope is gone.

02:16:36.259 --> 02:16:41.462
LAURA: Ten.

02:16:41.462 --> 02:16:44.295
MATT: All right.

02:16:44.295 --> 02:16:49.261
LAURA: And she's going to use her movement to run
back into the building with Scanlan.

02:16:49.261 --> 02:16:56.452
MATT: That's as far as she can get, right there.
Okay, that ends Pike's turn. Scanlan, you're up.

02:16:56.452 --> 02:17:02.813
SAM: Oh. I'll, through the earring, say, Grog, you
want to go for a ride, or no?

02:17:02.813 --> 02:17:05.270
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:14.952
SAM: Okay, action, I will arc around and Lightning
Bolt the dragon real quick. With the hand cone, I

02:17:14.952 --> 02:17:18.265
don't know if that makes any difference. No, it
doesn't. It might.

02:17:18.265 --> 02:17:20.771
MARISHA: It can't hurt. It's got to save against
that shit.

02:17:20.771 --> 02:17:24.379
MATT: Yeah, you can see it from there. It's high
enough in the sky. You don't have to arc around,

02:17:24.379 --> 02:17:28.537
you can go (magic shooting noise). Okay, makes his
save.

02:17:28.537 --> 02:17:32.267
SAM: Yeah, great, so what, I still roll damage and
he takes half?

02:17:32.267 --> 02:17:33.542
MATT: Yeah. He takes half.

02:17:33.542 --> 02:17:49.290
SAM: Okay. That's fine. 23. So, 12, 11, something
like that.

02:17:49.290 --> 02:17:50.488
MATT: Okay.

02:17:50.488 --> 02:17:52.421
SAM: Great.

02:17:52.421 --> 02:17:54.209
MATT: 11 points of lightning damage.

02:17:54.209 --> 02:17:59.828
MARISHA: Good job, buddy. Man, good thing we gave
you that flute.

02:17:59.828 --> 02:18:03.149
LAURA: I know, right, fucking A, Scanlan!

02:18:03.149 --> 02:18:05.313
SAM: We're doing great, guys, nobody's dead yet.

02:18:05.313 --> 02:18:08.667
TALIESIN: It's so great that you did that 11
points.

02:18:08.667 --> 02:18:11.750
MARISHA: Yeah, wait until we're-- he's on the
other side of the continent. It could like--

02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:19.061
SAM: And as the bonus action-- The Hand, who is
still alive. He took 102 points of damage, but is

02:18:19.061 --> 02:18:20.808
still alive.

02:18:20.808 --> 02:18:22.005
TRAVIS: Bigby's Hand is?

02:18:22.005 --> 02:18:30.027
SAM: Yes, because he has my hit points. So he'll
go over and lift up Grog by the scruff of his neck

02:18:30.027 --> 02:18:35.781
and go as high and mighty as he can. He can move
like 120 feet, I think.

02:18:35.781 --> 02:18:39.448
TRAVIS: Like a fucking puppy.

02:18:39.448 --> 02:18:42.907
MATT: You can move him up to 60 feet per turn.

02:18:42.907 --> 02:18:45.274
SAM: What? 120! Wait.

02:18:45.274 --> 02:18:49.449
MATT: No, the spell's range is 120. Per turn, as a
bonus action, it can move at 60 feet.

02:18:49.449 --> 02:18:51.892
(laughter)

02:18:51.892 --> 02:18:58.909
SAM: Well, knowing that, I'll just punch the
dragon.

02:18:58.909 --> 02:19:07.200
MATT: Okay. So the hand (whoosh) goes up. Punch
him. Roll a spell attack.

02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:08.629
SAM: Nope.

02:19:08.629 --> 02:19:11.336
MATT: Whiffs.

02:19:11.336 --> 02:19:17.657
LAURA: Wait, you're close to Pike. She uses War
God's Blessing to increase your attack by-- can

02:19:17.657 --> 02:19:21.114
she do that? Is it technically an attack that she
could add?

02:19:21.114 --> 02:19:26.963
MATT: Let me check real fast. Let me see here.

02:19:26.963 --> 02:19:30.980
LAURA: Was it really low?

02:19:30.980 --> 02:19:32.673
SAM: I mean, you don't know.

02:19:32.673 --> 02:19:36.524
MATT: Makes an attack roll.

02:19:36.524 --> 02:19:41.456
LAURA: So yeah? So, do I roll the ten, or is it
just a plus ten bonus?

02:19:41.456 --> 02:19:42.666
MATT: Plus ten bonus.

02:19:42.666 --> 02:19:44.709
SAM: Yeah, 23.

02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:47.075
MATT: 23 just hits.

02:19:47.075 --> 02:19:49.144
(cheering)

02:19:49.144 --> 02:19:52.610
SAM: It does hit! 6d8.

02:19:52.610 --> 02:19:54.433
MATT: 8d8.

02:19:54.433 --> 02:19:57.263
SAM: No, it's usually 4d8, I think.

02:19:57.263 --> 02:19:59.679
MATT: 4d8, and you cast it, it's usually fifth
level, you cast it as a seventh level.

02:19:59.679 --> 02:20:02.258
SAM: So it's 4d8, so now it's 6d8.

02:20:02.258 --> 02:20:04.019
MATT: It goes up by 2d8 every level higher.

02:20:04.019 --> 02:20:05.075
SAM: Oh, shit!

02:20:05.075 --> 02:20:06.170
LAURA: Oh my god. 4d8?

02:20:06.170 --> 02:20:07.319
SAM: No, 8d8.

02:20:07.319 --> 02:20:08.386
LAURA: 8d8?!

02:20:08.386 --> 02:20:12.641
MATT: Yes. Just punched the dragon in the face
with Bigby's Hand.

02:20:12.641 --> 02:20:16.655
SAM: Pike happened. Oh my god, Ashley is the MVP
tonight.

02:20:16.655 --> 02:20:20.348
(laughter)

02:20:20.348 --> 02:20:32.852
SAM: Okay. Not huge, but okay. It's okay. 36.

02:20:32.852 --> 02:20:34.858
LAURA, TRAVIS: That's great!

02:20:34.858 --> 02:20:37.025
MARISHA: That's better than 11.

02:20:37.025 --> 02:20:45.500
SAM: Yeah. Hey, I just dealt 47 points of damage!
That's respectable!

02:20:45.500 --> 02:20:49.338
(approving murmurs)

02:20:49.338 --> 02:20:51.883
TRAVIS: How's that Vestige treating you?

02:20:51.883 --> 02:21:06.201
MATT: Top of the next round, Percy. First you
take... You take ten, five points of fire damage.

02:21:06.201 --> 02:21:09.440
SAM: (whispering) Laura.

02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:13.248
MATT: That is terrifying. Oh my god.

02:21:13.248 --> 02:21:15.576
LAURA: Thanks for getting my attention for that.

02:21:15.576 --> 02:21:18.510
(laughter)

02:21:18.510 --> 02:21:20.002
MATT: Goddamn it.

02:21:20.002 --> 02:21:21.598
SAM: That will inspire you.

02:21:21.598 --> 02:21:23.247
LIAM: Somebody gets an inspiration die.

02:21:23.247 --> 02:21:24.768
(laughter)

02:21:24.768 --> 02:21:28.621
TALIESIN: I'm going to spider-climb-- I'm going to
stay within striking distance, I'm not going to

02:21:28.621 --> 02:21:33.534
disengage from the jerk, but I'm going to climb up
on the wall above him, if that's okay.

02:21:33.534 --> 02:21:39.586
MATT: I'd say yeah, you can do that. The wall next
to him, there's nothing above him.

02:21:39.586 --> 02:21:43.076
TALIESIN: Like, oh, I'm shooting at the
television. Here.

02:21:43.076 --> 02:21:47.978
MATT: Here? So you can move around and get on the
wall.

02:21:47.978 --> 02:21:51.946
TALIESIN: Yeah, like climb up there and be
sideways. I'm going to pull out Bad News, I'm

02:21:51.946 --> 02:21:55.344
going to try something new. I'm seeing that big
spike, there's a big metal spike stuck in his

02:21:55.344 --> 02:21:56.576
chest right now?

02:21:56.576 --> 02:22:01.175
MATT: No, there's no spike. There's a crack in the
crystal that's exposed.

02:22:01.175 --> 02:22:03.331
TALIESIN: Is there still not a metal pole?

02:22:03.331 --> 02:22:04.659
MATT: There's no metal pole.

02:22:04.659 --> 02:22:06.049
TALIESIN: I thought he got hit by a thing.

02:22:06.049 --> 02:22:07.634
MATT: No, he got hit by a Vax.

02:22:07.634 --> 02:22:11.693
TALIESIN: Okay, I thought he also got hit by a
thing. But that's okay. I'm going to try something

02:22:11.693 --> 02:22:17.066
weird. I'm going to spend a grit for advantage on
this shot, because--

02:22:17.066 --> 02:22:19.464
SAM: "Constructing a pole vault."

02:22:19.464 --> 02:22:21.923
TALIESIN: I'm going to add two points of Cabal's
Ruin to this.

02:22:21.923 --> 02:22:23.232
MATT: Okay.

02:22:23.232 --> 02:22:25.381
SAM: What does that do? What? You have a thing?

02:22:25.381 --> 02:22:27.615
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend two points of Cabal's
Ruin. I have a thing.

02:22:27.615 --> 02:22:29.245
MATT: You can spend them once you roll to hit.

02:22:29.245 --> 02:22:30.811
TALIESIN: Oh, I can wait until after?

02:22:30.811 --> 02:22:32.648
MATT: Wait until you see you hit it, then you can
spend the points.

02:22:32.648 --> 02:22:39.735
TALIESIN: Well, that's even better. So first shot
is a 27 to hit.

02:22:39.735 --> 02:22:41.318
MATT: That hits.

02:22:41.318 --> 02:22:46.210
TALIESIN: So I'm going to drop two-- I've got the
little thing running through my glove, I've got

02:22:46.210 --> 02:22:51.215
the wire. I'm just going to let go of the little
grounding wire and see what happens. I'll hold

02:22:51.289 --> 02:22:56.257
onto the barrel and pray. Let's add 2d6 to that.
Is that right? Yeah.

02:22:56.535 --> 02:22:57.372
LIAM: I really like this spider-climb guy.

02:22:57.372 --> 02:23:05.535
TALIESIN: I know, I'm digging this-- augh, it's
okay. Yeah, this is okay. 22 points of damage plus

02:23:05.535 --> 02:23:07.457
two points of electrical damage.

02:23:07.457 --> 02:23:08.797
MATT: Okay.

02:23:08.797 --> 02:23:10.642
SAM: Did you roll your Cabal's Ruin thing?

02:23:10.642 --> 02:23:15.502
TALIESIN: I did, yeah, I did, I'm going to do that
again.

02:23:15.502 --> 02:23:16.486
MATT: Okay.

02:23:16.486 --> 02:23:17.889
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn two more points--
Well, I'm going to wait. That's really cool, that

02:23:17.889 --> 02:23:19.193
I can wait.

02:23:19.193 --> 02:23:23.110
LAURA: That was the softest little roll.

02:23:23.110 --> 02:23:25.528
TALIESIN: I hate it when that happens. I know,
that was the worst roll I've ever done. That's

02:23:25.528 --> 02:23:28.740
okay. It's 22. Just hits?

02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:29.877
MATT: 22 misses.

02:23:29.877 --> 02:23:36.237
TALIESIN: 22 misses?! That's fine. I'm not going
to burn any Cabal. So that's fine.

02:23:36.237 --> 02:23:47.649
MATT: The first blast fires off... It impacts the
side of Thordak. You watch the little charge of

02:23:47.649 --> 02:23:52.951
energy shoot through. Second shot, however, goes a
little wide, as you feel the fire still burning up

02:23:52.951 --> 02:23:56.347
the front of your torso. It's enough to distract
you from your actual aiming.

02:23:56.347 --> 02:23:58.276
TALIESIN: That was very cool, though.

02:23:58.276 --> 02:24:00.105
MARISHA: You can do that.

02:24:00.105 --> 02:24:04.529
TALIESIN: Once I set it up, I can arc a charge to
the bullet.

02:24:04.529 --> 02:24:08.187
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn, Percy?

02:24:08.187 --> 02:24:13.466
TALIESIN: That ends my turn. I may drop back
behind-- No, I'm good, I'm good.

02:24:13.466 --> 02:24:26.507
MATT: At this point, the ground quakes beneath--

02:24:26.507 --> 02:24:34.374
TALIESIN: That was a terrible roll. Terrible
roll.

02:24:34.374 --> 02:24:35.892
MARISHA: Yes, it was.

02:24:35.892 --> 02:24:37.539
TALIESIN: Snake eyes was not cool.

02:24:37.539 --> 02:24:45.296
MATT: No, he can't do the same twice in a row, so
it's going to do another magma erupt. (laughs)

02:24:45.296 --> 02:24:53.425
Beneath where Gilmore is, the ground splits
open--

02:24:53.425 --> 02:24:54.954
(groans)

02:24:54.954 --> 02:25:00.086
MATT: --and another burst of magma billows out
from underneath. Going against Kima, Vax, that's

02:25:00.086 --> 02:25:04.043
where most of them are clustered. Kima, Vax, and
Gilmore. I need you to roll a dexterity saving throw.

02:25:04.043 --> 02:25:05.629
LIAM: Yeah, evasion for me.

02:25:05.629 --> 02:25:07.588
TALIESIN: Walls hate NPCs.

02:25:07.588 --> 02:25:13.608
LIAM: With advantage. 18 for me.

02:25:13.608 --> 02:25:21.496
MATT: 18 for you. All right, that's okay. Gilmore
rolls a--

02:25:21.496 --> 02:25:23.093
LAURA: Natural 20?

02:25:23.093 --> 02:25:27.584
MATT: 15, which is enough. Kima rolls a natural
20--

02:25:27.584 --> 02:25:29.205
(cheering)

02:25:29.205 --> 02:25:33.521
MATT: So half as much damage to each of you guys.
You take none.

02:25:33.521 --> 02:25:37.737
LIAM: I'm sitting pretty. I mean, I'm really
rough.

02:25:37.737 --> 02:25:39.711
LAURA: Don't say that out loud.

02:25:39.711 --> 02:25:41.615
SAM: Have you taken any damage?

02:25:41.615 --> 02:25:44.376
MATT: That's 21, that's ten points of fire damage
to both Kima and Gilmore.

02:25:44.376 --> 02:25:46.432
TALIESIN: Halved?

02:25:46.432 --> 02:25:48.797
MATT: That was halved.

02:25:48.797 --> 02:25:51.313
LIAM: I am Borishnakoffing all over this
battlefield.

02:25:51.313 --> 02:25:54.544
TALIESIN: Somebody's going to dive into that
hole.

02:25:54.544 --> 02:26:05.735
MATT: As that bursts off, you also watch as the
airship Deera coasts around this way and takes

02:26:05.735 --> 02:26:06.961
three shots.

02:26:06.961 --> 02:26:09.572
(cheering)

02:26:09.572 --> 02:26:20.158
MATT: Misses. Hits! And misses. So three of them
shoot past. The third one impacts for seven points

02:26:20.158 --> 02:26:27.391
of piercing damage to Thordak. You watch as two
other wyverns get cut down from the edges of the

02:26:27.391 --> 02:26:35.473
ship, slamming into the ground near you. Their
arms curl up, and the wings fall limply to the

02:26:35.473 --> 02:26:45.047
side. You also hear a slamming sound as from a
nearby wall, you watch as a fire giant that has

02:26:45.047 --> 02:26:47.742
climbed over the edge of the wall.

02:26:47.742 --> 02:26:51.349
LAURA: Why would you bring more things onto the
battlefield?!

02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:53.100
MATT: It charges into the fray, this way.

02:26:53.100 --> 02:26:54.880
MARISHA: Wait, over what wall, over what wall?

02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:56.664
MATT: On the outside of the side of the Cloudtop.

02:26:56.664 --> 02:26:58.505
SAM: Is this one of the fire giants we've seen?

02:26:58.505 --> 02:27:01.938
MARISHA: Yeah, is this one that Zahra and Kash
were guarding?

02:27:01.938 --> 02:27:04.276
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:27:04.276 --> 02:27:06.638
MARISHA: Can I do it?

02:27:06.638 --> 02:27:09.491
MATT: You barely have a view of it, so yes, you
can.

02:27:09.491 --> 02:27:10.833
LAURA: Do I have a view of it?

02:27:10.833 --> 02:27:12.439
MATT: No, you're inside the room.

02:27:12.439 --> 02:27:13.888
MARISHA: Ooh, yeah, 25.

02:27:13.888 --> 02:27:17.920
MATT: You see it, this one does not appear to be
coming from the direction they were.

02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:20.604
LAURA: That's good, that's good. That's not a damn
it, that's a good.

02:27:20.604 --> 02:27:22.951
MARISHA: Means they're still alive. Hopefully?

02:27:22.951 --> 02:27:30.595
MATT: With that, it is Raishan's turn. Raishan
gets her breath back.

02:27:30.595 --> 02:27:33.736
TRAVIS: (singing) Girl, get your breath back.

02:27:33.736 --> 02:27:37.909
MATT: Raishan rears back, (hissing roar) releases
the same poisonous torrent toward Thordak.

02:27:37.909 --> 02:27:41.785
TRAVIS: Halitosis is a bitch.

02:27:41.785 --> 02:27:45.689
SAM: We have exactly one ally dragon in this fight
right now.

02:27:45.689 --> 02:27:50.740
TRAVIS: I will fucking-- I will pop all your
knuckles.

02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:52.252
SAM: We do! She's great.

02:27:52.252 --> 02:27:56.376
LIAM: The last thing we'll do in this fight is
all turn on you.

02:27:56.376 --> 02:28:01.891
MARISHA: The last thing we do is die as we see a
bronze dragon show up.

02:28:01.891 --> 02:28:05.688
LAURA: Yeah, we're all dead on the ground, and
Scanlan's like, yay!

02:28:05.688 --> 02:28:11.228
MATT: He takes half damage as the poison cloud
billows up, (cough, sinister growl).

02:28:11.228 --> 02:28:12.967
SAM: Aw, he's still crazy.

02:28:12.967 --> 02:28:24.917
MATT: "You're still around us? That's okay.
There's still time... to eat." Raishan is going to

02:28:24.917 --> 02:28:31.934
fly past and land on the top of the roof, which
nearly crumbles. Nearly crumbles above you,

02:28:31.934 --> 02:28:36.526
Keyleth, you feel stones (crash) around you, and
you see Raishan landing on the ceiling of this

02:28:36.526 --> 02:28:38.714
damaged building as parts of it begin to
collapse.

02:28:38.714 --> 02:28:41.257
LAURA: Look how little she is.

02:28:41.257 --> 02:28:44.539
MATT: That ends Raishan's turn. Keyleth, you're
up.

02:28:44.539 --> 02:28:45.968
LIAM: Go, girl.

02:28:45.968 --> 02:28:57.938
MARISHA: So she's on top of me, more or less? I'm
going to turn around and Tidal Wave this elemental

02:28:57.938 --> 02:28:59.385
behind me.

02:28:59.385 --> 02:29:00.763
MATT: Okay.

02:29:00.763 --> 02:29:06.731
TALIESIN: I was going to say, if I'm caught in the
corner of this, will this extinguish me?

02:29:06.731 --> 02:29:10.155
MARISHA: Extinguishes all flames.

02:29:10.155 --> 02:29:14.477
MATT: It does. Wait, so what spell are you doing?
You're doing--

02:29:14.477 --> 02:29:15.957
TRAVIS: Tidal Wave.

02:29:15.957 --> 02:29:18.658
LAURA: Is that one, like, still up or something?
Is it like a concentration that just lasts?

02:29:18.658 --> 02:29:25.681
MARISHA: No, the other one was Tsunami. That one
is like the big daddy version of this one. Yeah.

02:29:25.681 --> 02:29:28.149
MATT: So, Percy, I need you to make a dexterity
saving throw.

02:29:28.149 --> 02:29:31.732
TALIESIN: Can I autofail if I just want to be--
Oh, that's right, for half damage.

02:29:31.732 --> 02:29:33.063
MATT: Yes.

02:29:33.063 --> 02:29:39.170
TALIESIN: All right. Dex saving throw. That's an
11.

02:29:39.170 --> 02:29:48.343
MATT: So roll 4d8 bludgeoning damage. Percy takes,
and Percy is knocked prone, but is no longer on fire.

02:29:48.343 --> 02:29:53.015
TALIESIN: I just fall on the ground, I assume.

02:29:53.015 --> 02:29:56.266
MARISHA: Sorry, Percy. I'm saving your life, man!

02:29:56.266 --> 02:30:06.245
MATT: However, the unscathed fire elemental is
turned to mist. Water pushing past and doing way

02:30:06.245 --> 02:30:07.784
too much damage for him to--

02:30:07.784 --> 02:30:14.386
MARISHA: Is this damage for Percy? 21.

02:30:14.386 --> 02:30:15.927
TRAVIS: Thanks, Keyleth.

02:30:15.927 --> 02:30:20.933
(laughter)

02:30:20.933 --> 02:30:22.732
LIAM: Legitimately though!

02:30:22.732 --> 02:30:29.219
MATT: But a full health fire elemental is turned
to mist and is immediately destroyed. Actually,

02:30:29.219 --> 02:30:33.979
the force of it blows out the rocks from this side
of the wall. And the wall, the wall here actually

02:30:33.979 --> 02:30:42.033
gets knocked open to that side as the tidal wave
pushes out. Keyleth, do you want to move or stay

02:30:42.033 --> 02:30:43.504
where you are?

02:30:43.504 --> 02:30:53.860
MARISHA: I'll pop myself out of the door a little
bit.

02:30:53.860 --> 02:30:55.230
MATT: Okay.

02:30:55.230 --> 02:31:01.068
SAM: What's that other thing that you've been
doing to him? That he has to save on every once in

02:31:01.068 --> 02:31:02.131
a while?

02:31:02.131 --> 02:31:03.387
LAURA: Oh, Contagion?

02:31:03.387 --> 02:31:06.358
MARISHA: Contagion, he has to do that at the end
of his turn. Did he do it at the last...?

02:31:06.358 --> 02:31:08.586
MATT: He did, yes. It was a 13 plus...

02:31:08.586 --> 02:31:12.372
MARISHA: So he's saved against two or one?

02:31:12.372 --> 02:31:14.985
MATT: He's only done two, so far, since you cast
it.

02:31:14.985 --> 02:31:19.265
MARISHA: He's only done-- I know about one.

02:31:19.265 --> 02:31:23.459
MATT: No, because you didn't do it your first
turn, you did it your second turn, so yeah, twice.

02:31:23.459 --> 02:31:25.145
LAURA: Yeah, he's definitely done it twice.

02:31:25.145 --> 02:31:26.983
MARISHA: And he's saved against both? Are you
sure?

02:31:26.983 --> 02:31:28.071
MATT: Yes.

02:31:28.071 --> 02:31:29.085
MARISHA: All right.

02:31:29.085 --> 02:31:30.782
SAM: But are you &lt;i&gt;sure&lt;/i&gt;?

02:31:30.782 --> 02:31:31.702
MATT: Yes.

02:31:31.702 --> 02:31:33.401
(laughter)

02:31:33.401 --> 02:31:35.117
MATT: Is that the end of your turn?

02:31:35.117 --> 02:31:37.584
MARISHA: Do I see Gilmore?

02:31:37.584 --> 02:31:40.703
MATT: You, from your current perspective, you do
not.

02:31:40.703 --> 02:31:42.188
MARISHA: Then, yeah.

02:31:42.188 --> 02:31:45.789
MATT: Okay. Jarett, who is currently scared out of
his wits.

02:31:45.789 --> 02:31:48.086
TRAVIS: Get your shit together, man.

02:31:48.086 --> 02:31:50.089
SAM: Jarett, do you need some suude?

02:31:50.089 --> 02:31:51.334
TRAVIS: Spice?

02:31:51.334 --> 02:31:55.532
MATT: Ha, He's like, "What? No, why would you..."

02:31:55.532 --> 02:31:57.309
SAM: Well, you look crazy right now.

02:31:57.309 --> 02:32:00.024
MATT: "Look at that!"

02:32:00.024 --> 02:32:02.776
SAM: It's like a Thursday.

02:32:02.776 --> 02:32:09.763
MATT: And he goes and takes two more shots, with
disadvantage against. That's a miss. Second shot,

02:32:09.763 --> 02:32:15.130
disadvantage. Is a miss. Both shots firing off.

02:32:15.130 --> 02:32:18.781
TRAVIS: We'll remember this. Your annual review's coming
up.

02:32:18.781 --> 02:32:21.689
SAM: Needs improvement.

02:32:21.689 --> 02:32:38.857
MATT: Gilmore, who's now conscious, doesn't have a
whole lot else as far as attack spells go, is

02:32:38.857 --> 02:32:44.396
going to attempt to stand up. "All right, that
was--"

02:32:44.396 --> 02:32:47.013
(groaning)

02:32:47.013 --> 02:32:48.742
LIAM: Matt, why would you!

02:32:48.742 --> 02:32:50.105
SAM: He flew 30 feet.

02:32:50.105 --> 02:32:52.582
MATT: I can count that.

02:32:52.582 --> 02:32:54.766
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: No!

02:32:54.766 --> 02:32:56.616
MATT: Then stop giving me shit.

02:32:56.616 --> 02:32:59.200
LIAM: Why would you!

02:32:59.200 --> 02:33:05.594
MATT: As he gets up, he leans back and backs out of
the rubble, takes in his surroundings, sees the

02:33:05.594 --> 02:33:12.357
magma receding from the crack in the ground. "This
is... You guys bring me to the greatest places.

02:33:12.357 --> 02:33:18.265
"Oh, he's not looking too good." And releases a
Lightning Bolt.

02:33:18.265 --> 02:33:20.224
MARISHA: He's not looking too good?

02:33:20.224 --> 02:33:25.545
MATT: He's not looking too good. And he's going to
release a Lightning Bolt at fifth level. A

02:33:25.545 --> 02:33:34.449
5th-level Lightning Bolt. A 5th-level Lightning
Bolt. Thordak makes his save. And that will be,

02:33:34.449 --> 02:33:53.534
come on, dice. 49. Half that will be 24 points of
lightning damage against Thordak. That ends

02:33:53.534 --> 02:33:56.852
Gilmore's turn. Grog and Thordak.

02:33:56.852 --> 02:33:58.851
TRAVIS: Oh God. I'm going first.

02:33:58.851 --> 02:34:00.206
MATT: All right, what are you doing?

02:34:00.206 --> 02:34:05.145
TRAVIS: Because it's so insignificant. I'm going
to attach the Bloodaxe to the Chain of Returning

02:34:05.145 --> 02:34:06.846
and throw it at his foot.

02:34:06.846 --> 02:34:08.958
TALIESIN: You could go in the hole, just saying.

02:34:08.958 --> 02:34:10.645
TRAVIS: I thought we didn't care about the hole?

02:34:10.645 --> 02:34:11.722
TALIESIN: I care about the hole.

02:34:11.722 --> 02:34:13.020
TRAVIS: Grog &lt;i&gt;loves&lt;/i&gt; going in holes.

02:34:13.020 --> 02:34:15.455
LAURA: Just do what you're going to do.

02:34:15.455 --> 02:34:17.013
TRAVIS: All right, I throw the Bloodaxe.

02:34:17.013 --> 02:34:21.359
SAM: You can also hold your attack until he's
closer or something?

02:34:21.359 --> 02:34:29.778
TRAVIS: Reckless! Yeah, that's not going to
happen. 31.

02:34:29.778 --> 02:34:31.869
MATT: 31.

02:34:31.869 --> 02:34:43.086
TRAVIS: It's not Great Weapon Master. That's a 12.
That's good. Two points of necrotic for 27 and I'm

02:34:43.086 --> 02:34:45.359
enlarged! And that's another one.

02:34:45.359 --> 02:34:47.169
SAM: Hey, 28 is great!

02:34:47.169 --> 02:34:49.218
TRAVIS: Hey, matzoh ball in your face.

02:34:49.218 --> 02:34:50.589
MATT: That's awesome.

02:34:50.589 --> 02:34:52.228
TRAVIS: And then I've got to pull it back.

02:34:52.228 --> 02:34:54.270
TALIESIN: With advantage.

02:34:54.270 --> 02:34:56.405
TRAVIS: Seven plus 14, woo! Got it.

02:34:56.405 --> 02:34:57.993
MATT: Yeah. You pull the axe back.

02:34:57.993 --> 02:35:03.253
SAM: You got a bonus action or something?

02:35:03.253 --> 02:35:04.847
LAURA: You could attack again?

02:35:04.847 --> 02:35:07.049
TRAVIS: No I can't, I can only throw it once.

02:35:07.049 --> 02:35:08.891
MATT: Thordak is going to swoop in.

02:35:08.891 --> 02:35:11.018
SAM: You could heal or something? You've got
potions and shit, don't you?

02:35:11.018 --> 02:35:15.825
LAURA: Can't you hold your other attack until he
moves?

02:35:15.825 --> 02:35:17.519
TRAVIS: I don't have another attack.

02:35:17.519 --> 02:35:19.143
MATT: Let's see here.

02:35:19.143 --> 02:35:20.770
LIAM: He's hesitating.

02:35:20.770 --> 02:35:25.580
TRAVIS: It takes my whole action. I get two
attacks in an action.

02:35:25.580 --> 02:35:39.690
SAM: He's hovering. God, he's going to his other
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons game!

02:35:39.690 --> 02:35:41.041
(laughter)

02:35:41.041 --> 02:35:43.065
LAURA: He's like, welp, I'm over this.

02:35:43.065 --> 02:35:46.388
SAM: Oh God! That's dangerously close.

02:35:46.388 --> 02:35:49.237
MATT: I know.

02:35:49.237 --> 02:35:50.446
LAURA: Oh god.

02:35:50.446 --> 02:35:52.374
MATT: Right there, Gilmore just behind.

02:35:52.374 --> 02:35:53.861
LAURA: Gilmore is up his butt.

02:35:53.861 --> 02:35:56.869
MATT: Raishan right there. Lands right up next to
Pike.

02:35:56.869 --> 02:35:58.053
LAURA: No!

02:35:58.053 --> 02:35:59.836
MATT: Everyone else in that vicinity.

02:35:59.836 --> 02:36:01.843
LAURA: Oh no, that's Pike and Scanlan isn't it?

02:36:01.843 --> 02:36:02.847
SAM: Oh boy.

02:36:02.847 --> 02:36:08.260
MATT: Yup. And (inhales).

02:36:08.260 --> 02:36:11.850
LAURA: What? Why would you do that to Pike?!

02:36:11.850 --> 02:36:17.676
MATT: Rolled a five on that. Because Pike keeps
healing everybody. That'll be towards Jarett,

02:36:17.676 --> 02:36:20.088
Scanlan and Pike. I need you guys to make dex
saves.

02:36:20.088 --> 02:36:21.509
SAM: I'll Cutting Words this.

02:36:21.509 --> 02:36:24.080
MATT: How many more bardic inspiration dice do you
have by the way?

02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:27.000
SAM: I have used only three. That means I have
three left.

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.407
MATT: You've inspired one and you've Cutting Words
twice? Correct, all right, cool. This is your fourth?

02:36:29.407 --> 02:36:35.230
SAM: Yep. So I will Cutting Words that up with a
poem I will make up on the spot. Roses are red,

02:36:35.230 --> 02:36:41.665
Violets are blue, I'm a gnome, and you're an
asshole.

02:36:41.665 --> 02:36:44.345
(laughter)

02:36:44.345 --> 02:36:48.875
MATT: Roll a d12. What was Pike's dexterity save
again?

02:36:48.875 --> 02:36:50.688
LIAM: Oh no, it's this die.

02:36:50.688 --> 02:36:53.658
SAM: Oh, you can reduce that by one point, Matt
Mercer.

02:36:53.658 --> 02:36:59.015
MATT: (laughing) Oh no. What did you get? Nah,
roll your dexterity saving throw.

02:36:59.015 --> 02:37:03.475
SAM: My dexterity saving throw. Terrible, 15.

02:37:03.475 --> 02:37:05.553
MATT: Jarett does not make it either.

02:37:05.553 --> 02:37:07.790
LIAM: Big eight, big eight.

02:37:07.790 --> 02:37:09.460
MATT: All right, well.

02:37:09.460 --> 02:37:13.442
LAURA: One of our Jaeger controllers did worse
than our other--

02:37:13.442 --> 02:37:16.759
LIAM: You shut your pie hole! Hear me, half-elf?

02:37:16.759 --> 02:37:20.558
MATT: Well, with the damage reduction from Scanlan
that's only 100 points of fire damage.

02:37:20.558 --> 02:37:22.309
TALIESIN: Cut in half.

02:37:22.309 --> 02:37:31.065
MATT: Cut in half, so that's 50 to each of you.
Jarett is practically immolated. His unconscious

02:37:31.065 --> 02:37:39.265
body hits the ground, crisp, smoking. He's
currently going into shock and is in a really bad

02:37:39.265 --> 02:37:40.848
place right now.

02:37:40.848 --> 02:37:42.747
SAM: Where's Pike? What's Pike doing?

02:37:42.747 --> 02:37:48.143
LAURA: Pike is-- Wait, minus 50. She's at 50
minus--she's at 34 points right now.

02:37:48.143 --> 02:37:54.394
TALIESIN: In combat range of a dragon.

02:37:54.394 --> 02:37:59.385
TRAVIS: I never finished my turn, so can I use my
movement now? Since we're on the same, can I chase

02:37:59.385 --> 02:38:03.356
him back to where he landed? 50 feet and how far
does that get me?

02:38:03.356 --> 02:38:05.155
MATT: Yeah, you can get right up behind him right
there.

02:38:05.155 --> 02:38:06.708
LAURA: Can you attack him now?

02:38:06.708 --> 02:38:13.048
TRAVIS: Nah. Nah. Actually, my bonus action is
still there and I am frenzied.

02:38:13.048 --> 02:38:14.851
MATT: Yes, you are.

02:38:14.851 --> 02:38:15.944
TRAVIS: Can I attack?

02:38:15.944 --> 02:38:16.992
MATT: Sure.

02:38:16.992 --> 02:38:18.167
TRAVIS: I'll do it Reckless.

02:38:18.167 --> 02:38:19.916
MATT: I'll let you do it. It all happened at
once.

02:38:19.916 --> 02:38:23.142
TRAVIS: 29?

02:38:23.142 --> 02:38:24.988
MATT: 29 hits.

02:38:24.988 --> 02:38:37.675
TRAVIS: Yeah, not Great Weapon Master. Nine plus
two, 26, 29. 29.

02:38:37.675 --> 02:38:45.238
MATT: 29? All righty. That ends your turn.

02:38:45.238 --> 02:38:46.390
TRAVIS: That does.

02:38:46.390 --> 02:38:52.316
SAM: Matt, in the interest of honor, should I roll
a concentration saving throw?

02:38:52.316 --> 02:38:54.023
MATT: Oh yes, you should. Sorry, thank you.

02:38:54.023 --> 02:38:56.087
SAM: I rolled a-- what do I add to it?

02:38:56.087 --> 02:39:00.317
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw, so you add
your constitution save.

02:39:00.317 --> 02:39:03.504
SAM: Constitution? So 18.

02:39:03.504 --> 02:39:10.845
MATT: With that, Bigby's Hand fades, the spell
knocked asunder. Thank you for reminding me of

02:39:10.845 --> 02:39:15.148
that. So that comes to end that turn.

02:39:15.148 --> 02:39:17.398
MARISHA: He has to roll a save.

02:39:17.398 --> 02:39:22.208
MATT: Yes, he does. And that is a seven plus 16.

02:39:22.208 --> 02:39:24.170
MARISHA: Does he still have disadvantage on
these?

02:39:24.170 --> 02:39:28.534
MATT: No, he doesn't have disadvantage on every
save, just the one. He was Cutting Words'd, you're right.

02:39:28.534 --> 02:39:33.436
MARISHA: Yeah. He has to roll under a five.

02:39:33.436 --> 02:39:35.702
MATT: Same thing. So with that, the third save is
made, Contagion.

02:39:35.702 --> 02:39:40.562
SAM: At least it won't eat up my Cutting Words any
more.

02:39:40.562 --> 02:39:48.060
MARISHA: It's resting in peace with my 8th-level
spell and her dragon-slaying arrow. They're in a

02:39:48.060 --> 02:39:49.315
puddle somewhere.

02:39:49.315 --> 02:39:50.889
MATT: It's a rough couple rounds.

02:39:50.889 --> 02:39:56.030
LAURA: Did I see where that dragon-slaying arrow
sailed off to?

02:39:56.030 --> 02:40:04.209
MATT: With the sheer amount of clouds of ash and
blackness in the air, you have no idea where it

02:40:04.209 --> 02:40:12.981
went, I'm afraid. At the end of Thordak's turn,
the wyvern that had seen you, it did spot you.

02:40:12.981 --> 02:40:18.291
Your stealth was not very good. It leaps down into
the back of the building and (growls) coming

02:40:18.291 --> 02:40:28.076
towards you. The wyvern's going to make a
multi-attack. The first is a bite attack against

02:40:28.076 --> 02:40:36.610
you. That's a natural one. Does not hit you. The
stinger, however, is a natural 20. Wow! So that is

02:40:36.610 --> 02:40:44.088
for 12 points of piercing damage to you and I need
you to make a constitution saving throw.

02:40:44.088 --> 02:40:46.119
LIAM and TALIESIN: Poison immunity.

02:40:46.119 --> 02:40:47.876
MATT: That's right. So no effect.

02:40:47.876 --> 02:40:49.106
LAURA: 12 points of damage.

02:40:49.106 --> 02:41:01.687
MATT: The rider is going to swing at you with a
heavy club and then a javelin. That is a 16.

02:41:01.687 --> 02:41:03.495
What's your AC?

02:41:03.495 --> 02:41:04.690
LAURA: 21.

02:41:04.690 --> 02:41:15.886
MATT: Nope. And no. Misses you with both. You're
just too quick for him. The giant sees Percy lying

02:41:15.886 --> 02:41:25.396
on the ground and goes (yells). With its giant
two-handed sword, it's going to make two attacks

02:41:25.396 --> 02:41:33.066
against Percy with advantage. 19, so that's 30 for
the first one.

02:41:33.066 --> 02:41:34.967
TALIESIN: Oh, that just hits.

02:41:34.967 --> 02:41:38.189
MATT: And a 22 with the second.

02:41:38.189 --> 02:41:39.657
TALIESIN: That also just hits.

02:41:39.657 --> 02:41:44.210
MATT: All right. So you take 28 points of slashing
damage from each hit.

02:41:44.210 --> 02:41:48.022
TALIESIN: So that's 28 times two.

02:41:48.022 --> 02:41:49.822
LAURA: 56.

02:41:49.822 --> 02:41:55.250
TALIESIN: 56. All right, that's fine. I blame you
for all of this.

02:41:55.250 --> 02:41:57.195
SAM: We're getting in flute range soon.

02:41:57.195 --> 02:42:03.053
TALIESIN: I'll be hearing about it from the
kitchen. It'll be great. I'll be working on my new

02:42:03.053 --> 02:42:04.482
character.

02:42:04.482 --> 02:42:09.843
MATT: All right. That brings us to--

02:42:09.843 --> 02:42:11.283
SAM: Raishan?

02:42:11.283 --> 02:42:16.688
MATT: No. That brings us to Vex's turn.

02:42:16.688 --> 02:42:19.068
LAURA: I can't see anything about where I am.

02:42:19.068 --> 02:42:20.223
MATT: You're back here right now.

02:42:20.223 --> 02:42:21.906
LAURA: Yeah, I can't see that on the screen, so I
don't know.

02:42:21.906 --> 02:42:27.468
LIAM: Other side of that building.

02:42:27.468 --> 02:42:31.988
LAURA: Can I use disengage to get away from the
wyvern?

02:42:31.988 --> 02:42:33.554
MATT: Yeah.

02:42:33.554 --> 02:42:41.198
LAURA: I'm going to do that and I'll run out
somewhere. Where's the laser pointer?

02:42:41.198 --> 02:42:44.975
LIAM: I can't see where Vex is at all.

02:42:44.975 --> 02:42:47.029
LAURA: I just have no clue where I am.

02:42:47.029 --> 02:42:49.434
MATT: Well, I have you right here because you
actually fell and your base came off and I glued

02:42:49.434 --> 02:42:51.813
it together when you were talking.

02:42:51.813 --> 02:42:54.862
LAURA: No way! Oh, I thought you said the face.

02:42:54.862 --> 02:42:57.373
SAM: He has crazy glue on his person?

02:42:57.373 --> 02:43:00.910
MATT: Like any good dungeon master should. So
you're inside this building right now.

02:43:00.910 --> 02:43:11.809
LAURA: If I'm hasted, does that affect my broom?

02:43:11.809 --> 02:43:13.132
MATT: No.

02:43:13.132 --> 02:43:15.320
LAURA: So I just run out.

02:43:15.320 --> 02:43:20.553
MATT: So you just run out this way. You have a lot
of movement speed, so you're still out here at

02:43:20.553 --> 02:43:22.471
half movement.

02:43:22.471 --> 02:43:28.751
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to run through the
building and under Raishan and shoot up at Thordak

02:43:28.751 --> 02:43:30.391
from through the building.

02:43:30.391 --> 02:43:33.611
LIAM: Ditch the broom.

02:43:33.611 --> 02:43:36.121
MATT: Go for it. Make your shots.

02:43:36.121 --> 02:43:51.321
LAURA: Okay. Oh no, that one doesn't hit. Okay,
second one. Okay, that hits. That's 29.

02:43:51.321 --> 02:43:53.644
MATT: 29. All right.

02:43:53.644 --> 02:43:56.063
LAURA: Can I do that with a poison arrow? I should
have said that before.

02:43:56.063 --> 02:43:57.567
MATT: You should have said that before.

02:43:57.567 --> 02:44:22.520
LAURA: Never mind. 18, that's with four lightning.
I do get sneak attack right now. 15 more.

02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:29.865
MATT: Okay. That was the first roll. Second
attack?

02:44:29.865 --> 02:44:35.280
LAURA: Yeah. Should I do the second dragon attack? I'm
so scared to use the dragon arrow.

02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:42.913
TRAVIS: There is no tomorrow. There's a giant
fucking dragon and a fire giant.

02:44:42.913 --> 02:44:46.087
LIAM: Pop his head off in one shot. Go.

02:44:46.087 --> 02:44:56.109
LAURA: I'm going to use my dragon arrow. My
last one. Oh, good! That was so close but it

02:44:56.109 --> 02:44:57.681
definitely hit.

02:44:57.681 --> 02:44:59.042
MATT: Okay.

02:44:59.042 --> 02:45:08.672
LAURA: Oh God. Okay. 17 with one lightning.

02:45:08.672 --> 02:45:11.462
MATT: One lightning damage. All right.

02:45:11.462 --> 02:45:23.873
LAURA: So three more. And how many do I add
for the dragon arrow?

02:45:23.873 --> 02:45:25.372
MATT: I'm looking it up right now, actually.

02:45:25.372 --> 02:45:26.672
SAM: Ooh!

02:45:26.672 --> 02:45:28.717
LAURA: I think it's 10d6. I think.

02:45:28.717 --> 02:45:30.191
SAM: Is it really?

02:45:30.191 --> 02:45:32.815
LAURA: Or 6d10. It's one of those two.

02:45:32.815 --> 02:45:34.243
SAM: 10d20.

02:45:34.243 --> 02:45:38.110
LAURA: 10d20. 12d12.

02:45:38.110 --> 02:45:43.540
TRAVIS: 100d100s. And the universe implodes.

02:45:43.540 --> 02:45:45.651
MATT: DC 17 constitution saving throw.

02:45:45.651 --> 02:45:47.813
LAURA: He gets to save?

02:45:47.813 --> 02:45:52.463
MATT: Yes, he does. Which he makes. So he takes
half damage. So it's 6d10.

02:45:52.463 --> 02:46:00.605
LAURA: Oh! Whoa. That's okay, I'll just roll this,
'cause this is easier.

02:46:00.605 --> 02:46:12.087
LIAM: 6d10.

02:46:12.087 --> 02:46:15.101
LAURA: Oh, that was just 6d10. 32 halved.

02:46:15.101 --> 02:46:17.111
MATT: 32 halved. All right.

02:46:17.111 --> 02:46:18.374
SAM: Worth it.

02:46:18.374 --> 02:46:26.048
MATT: You release the first arrow, which goes and
strikes Thordak in the upper shoulder wing area.

02:46:26.048 --> 02:46:31.911
(growls) He turns around and goes to face you, the
arms and wings open angrily. As you release the

02:46:31.911 --> 02:46:36.692
dragon-slaying arrow, it goes and hits the side
where the chest is currently disintegrated and

02:46:36.692 --> 02:46:40.656
exposed. As the arrow, using the power of Fenthras
behind it, slams into the crystal, the crystal

02:46:40.656 --> 02:46:56.498
shatters. As it breaks, you watch as Thordak goes
(crazed laughter) and the form begins to slowly shrink.

02:46:56.498 --> 02:46:59.002
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

02:46:59.002 --> 02:47:07.273
MATT: (growling) He seems to be grinning and
laughing through the pain as the swollen,

02:47:07.273 --> 02:47:15.268
primordial dragon form of Thordak begins to slowly
wither and wither.

02:47:15.268 --> 02:47:17.407
SAM: You have another model?

02:47:17.407 --> 02:47:19.092
LAURA: What?!

02:47:19.092 --> 02:47:21.202
SAM: And it's even bigger.

02:47:21.202 --> 02:47:25.656
LAURA: Look at the puny little fuck.

02:47:25.656 --> 02:47:28.066
SAM: He's a little puny baby.

02:47:28.066 --> 02:47:31.993
MATT: That's still a pretty fucking huge dragon.

02:47:31.993 --> 02:47:36.821
(laughter)

02:47:36.821 --> 02:47:38.741
SAM: He's so sad.

02:47:38.741 --> 02:47:48.035
MATT: Now there are hanging folds of dragon hide
skin. The form shrunk, but portions still are

02:47:48.035 --> 02:47:49.629
sagging off of it.

02:47:49.629 --> 02:48:02.827
LAURA: Can I duck around the side so I'm in the
building? So I'm not in the opening. Yeah.

02:48:02.827 --> 02:48:09.010
MARISHA: Are we going to try and take Raishan out
as well?

02:48:09.010 --> 02:48:21.925
MATT: At the end of your turn, he's going to use
two legendary actions to wing attack. Trying to

02:48:21.925 --> 02:48:34.513
whip the wings much faster now due to the somewhat
dire circumstances. I need Pike, and currently

02:48:34.513 --> 02:48:38.986
just Pike, to make a dexterity saving throw.

02:48:38.986 --> 02:48:42.524
SAM: Come on, Pike. For all the marbles.

02:48:42.524 --> 02:48:44.317
LAURA: 17.

02:48:44.317 --> 02:49:02.537
MATT: Nope. Pike takes 20 points of bludgeoning
damage and eight points of fire damage reduced to four.

02:49:02.537 --> 02:49:07.041
LAURA: So she's got ten points left.

02:49:07.041 --> 02:49:10.351
SAM: She's a perfect ten. Always was.

02:49:10.351 --> 02:49:19.040
MATT: He's going to fly up--

02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:21.816
SAM: Does Pike get an attack of opportunity?

02:49:21.816 --> 02:49:23.032
TRAVIS: I do!

02:49:23.032 --> 02:49:24.259
LAURA: And Pike does!

02:49:24.259 --> 02:49:26.704
MATT: There we go. You both do.

02:49:26.704 --> 02:49:33.874
TRAVIS: Has his AC changed with his different
size? You don't know? Reckless, Great Weapon

02:49:33.874 --> 02:49:40.446
Master. Natural 20.

02:49:40.446 --> 02:49:41.659
MATT: Really?

02:49:41.659 --> 02:49:43.199
TRAVIS: Yeah, on the first roll.

02:49:43.199 --> 02:49:47.285
LAURA: And Pike rolled a 32.

02:49:47.285 --> 02:49:48.823
SAM: Jesus. What is she attacking with?

02:49:48.823 --> 02:49:49.973
LAURA: Her Mace of Disruption.

02:49:49.973 --> 02:49:51.080
SAM: Yes, she is.

02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:52.996
MATT: So go ahead and roll damage for both of
them.

02:49:52.996 --> 02:49:58.921
TRAVIS: I also have brutal critical which at
thirteenth level, you roll two additional damage dice.

02:49:58.921 --> 02:50:00.269
MATT: Yes, you do.

02:50:00.269 --> 02:50:01.755
TALIESIN: Which you then double, don't you?

02:50:01.755 --> 02:50:06.742
MATT: No. You add those two. So roll the damage
first, and then double the dice.

02:50:06.742 --> 02:50:10.627
LAURA: And then she gets Divine Strike, right? On
her attack.

02:50:10.627 --> 02:50:11.730
MATT: Correct.

02:50:11.730 --> 02:50:14.662
TRAVIS: 28. So I double that?

02:50:14.662 --> 02:50:22.846
MATT: You double the dice. Including the d4 and d6
from your weapon and your enlarged status.

02:50:22.846 --> 02:50:40.235
TRAVIS: Right. So that's 16 doubled, 32. So then,
that's an 11. So 47.

02:50:40.276 --> 02:50:41.945
MATT: Nice, and Pike's?

02:50:41.945 --> 02:50:54.378
LAURA: Pike rolled-- fuck. 18. 19! It was 19.

02:50:54.378 --> 02:51:03.794
MATT: Okay. Perfect. You both strike, as the
now-diminished form of Thordak begins to pull

02:51:03.794 --> 02:51:08.965
backward, eyes looking around. The piercing
star-like white light of the eyes seems to have

02:51:08.965 --> 02:51:16.256
slowly recoiled into a glowing reddish-orange. And
you can now see where the crystal once was in the

02:51:16.256 --> 02:51:23.681
chest, there is just a gaping hole where bits
of flesh and dragon muscle are hanging out,

02:51:23.681 --> 02:51:30.012
occasionally slopping out of the wound. He's
pulling back. All right.

02:51:30.012 --> 02:51:31.256
LIAM: I'm up.

02:51:31.256 --> 02:51:32.455
MATT: Yep.

02:51:32.455 --> 02:51:38.128
LIAM: I'm going to arc up and land on his head.
I'm just going to unload all three: action,

02:51:38.128 --> 02:51:39.853
action, bonus action, into his head.

02:51:39.853 --> 02:51:41.121
MATT: Okay.

02:51:41.121 --> 02:51:50.443
LIAM: First attack probably misses, that's 17?

02:51:50.443 --> 02:51:51.841
MATT: Misses.

02:51:51.841 --> 02:51:54.175
LIAM: Second attack hits. That's 24.

02:51:54.175 --> 02:51:55.180
MATT: Hits.

02:51:55.180 --> 02:51:58.449
LIAM: Third attack with the dragon sword is a 22.

02:51:58.449 --> 02:52:00.004
MATT: 22 hits.

02:52:00.004 --> 02:52:49.442
LIAM: So, with Whisper. (counting) That's 45 with
Whisper. And then with the dragonslayer sword.

02:52:49.442 --> 02:53:09.688
Eight plus six plus 3d6. So 21. What did I say
before that?

02:53:09.688 --> 02:53:11.374
LAURA and TRAVIS: 45.

02:53:11.374 --> 02:53:14.744
LIAM: So 21 plus 45 is-- So 66.

02:53:14.744 --> 02:53:21.182
LAURA: It's 45 for the first attack, 21
for the second.

02:53:21.182 --> 02:53:23.972
MATT: Yeah. Okay.

02:53:23.972 --> 02:53:25.368
LIAM: And I will stay there.

02:53:25.368 --> 02:53:30.272
MATT: You're going to stay there? All right. So
you are currently up here, in Thordak's face.

02:53:30.272 --> 02:53:36.043
LAURA: This is going to be bad if 
we have to take Raishan out.

02:53:36.043 --> 02:53:41.221
MATT: Cool, so that ends Vax's turn. Kima--

02:53:41.221 --> 02:53:46.672
SAM: Oh yeah, the wyvern.

02:53:46.672 --> 02:53:51.333
MATT: That wyvern just can't seem to keep itself
standing.

02:53:51.333 --> 02:54:01.197
SAM: That was really good handwork, I didn't catch
any of it. That I got.

02:54:01.197 --> 02:54:09.193
MATT: She's just going to move towards Raishan.
She's going to move over to this wall.

02:54:09.245 --> 02:54:12.981
LIAM: Sorry. Also, four for Hunter's Mark on the
second attack as well.

02:54:12.981 --> 02:54:25.293
MATT: Okay. That's ends Kima's turn, going over
there. Pike's turn. Pike is knocked prone from the spell earlier.

02:54:25.293 --> 02:54:29.886
LAURA: She's still alive. She gets up.

02:54:29.886 --> 02:54:32.290
LIAM: Girl.

02:54:32.290 --> 02:54:41.609
LAURA: (singing) She's going to Guiding Bolt up
the butt! At what level do we have left?

02:54:41.609 --> 02:54:46.141
LIAM: So many levels. All the levels. Pike cheat
sheet. Five!

02:54:46.141 --> 02:54:47.870
LAURA: She's going to cast it at a five.

02:54:47.870 --> 02:54:55.170
LIAM: Plus 1d6 every level above second level. So
3d6.

02:54:55.170 --> 02:55:01.891
LAURA: 4d6. Plus 4d6. So 8d6. She has to roll the
attack first, or just straight-up?

02:55:01.891 --> 02:55:06.224
MATT: Well, she has to roll to attack with her
spell bonus, her spell attack bonus.

02:55:06.224 --> 02:55:09.096
LAURA: 24.

02:55:09.096 --> 02:55:10.528
MATT: 24 hits.

02:55:10.528 --> 02:55:14.488
LAURA: All right. So 8d6.

02:55:14.488 --> 02:55:22.533
LIAM: You can do it, Pike. All the way from New
York City.

02:55:22.533 --> 02:55:35.600
LAURA: Five. Seven. Eight. Ten. 16. 18. Another
two. 26.

02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:40.660
MATT: 26? Nice. As the guiding bolt slams into the
side of Thordak's side, you can see this

02:55:40.660 --> 02:55:44.567
glimmering beacon of light. The next attack
against Thordak has advantage.

02:55:44.567 --> 02:55:55.360
LAURA: Oh good. And then she's going to Healing
Word again? Yeah, she's pretty fucked, so she'll

02:55:55.360 --> 02:55:59.164
Healing Word at second level, that's her last
2nd-level...

02:55:59.164 --> 02:56:03.597
MATT: So 2d4 plus five. To herself?

02:56:03.597 --> 02:56:09.636
LAURA: And that's just to one person? Yeah, so
she'll... so she's going to do that to Jarett.

02:56:09.636 --> 02:56:11.226
MATT: Okay.

02:56:11.226 --> 02:56:13.457
SAM: She would heal Jarett over herself?

02:56:13.457 --> 02:56:18.374
LAURA: It's Pike. I'm being honest, she would heal
Jarett.

02:56:18.374 --> 02:56:20.612
TRAVIS: I don't know why we're wasting that on
Jarett.

02:56:20.612 --> 02:56:25.032
MATT: Jarett went and got you illicit drugs,
Scanlan!

02:56:25.032 --> 02:56:30.765
TRAVIS: I mean, he had a great accent, but fuck.
You remember the cryptkeeper? Jarett's going to

02:56:30.765 --> 02:56:32.877
those auditions tomorrow.

02:56:32.877 --> 02:56:34.829
LAURA: So that's eight.

02:56:34.829 --> 02:56:38.652
MATT: Eight? Okay, so Jarett is healed up eight
points.

02:56:38.652 --> 02:56:41.607
LIAM: He is Groot.

02:56:41.607 --> 02:56:43.018
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:56:43.018 --> 02:56:48.366
MATT: Where the terrible burns are, most of them
seem to heal, or at least scar to a point where he

02:56:48.366 --> 02:56:51.789
comes to consciousness. He's like, "What
happened?"

02:56:51.789 --> 02:56:55.771
LAURA: "Jarett, you need to get up and fight."

02:56:55.771 --> 02:57:08.429
MATT: "Right." Grabs the crossbow to the side,
leans up. So was that Pike's turn?

02:57:08.429 --> 02:57:09.642
LAURA: Yeah.

02:57:09.642 --> 02:57:11.982
MATT: All right, was that Pike's turn? Scanlan,
you're up.

02:57:11.982 --> 02:57:14.600
TALIESIN: Like slap the charred skin off his face.
Get back in there!

02:57:14.600 --> 02:57:17.302
LIAM: The whole face comes off.

02:57:17.302 --> 02:57:32.004
SAM: Shit. I will use my action to pour my
superior healing potion into Pike's mouth.

02:57:32.004 --> 02:57:34.438
LIAM: That's love.

02:57:34.438 --> 02:57:37.735
LAURA: "Scanlan, I can do that myself."

02:57:37.735 --> 02:57:46.342
SAM: Oh wait. First, I aerate it.

02:57:46.342 --> 02:57:51.239
(laughter)

02:57:51.239 --> 02:57:57.335
LAURA: So that's 8d4?

02:57:57.335 --> 02:57:59.722
SAM: I don't know. What is it?

02:57:59.722 --> 02:58:03.185
LAURA: That is 8d4. Do you do that or do I?

02:58:03.185 --> 02:58:04.761
SAM: Do I roll it, or does she?

02:58:04.761 --> 02:58:07.649
MATT: You roll it, that's fine.

02:58:07.649 --> 02:58:26.447
SAM: It's just a bunch of d4s? 8d4s? Oh my god.
This is so many. Six. 13. 16. 20, plus something.

02:58:26.447 --> 02:58:27.892
Plus six, 26.

02:58:27.973 --> 02:58:29.475
LAURA: Okay, that's good.

02:58:29.475 --> 02:58:36.327
SAM: Who else can I see? Nobody. Jarett's alive,
right?

02:58:36.327 --> 02:58:40.400
MATT: Correct.

02:58:40.400 --> 02:58:43.914
SAM: Now as my bonus action...

02:58:43.914 --> 02:58:46.334
TRAVIS: Whether he wants to be when he sees a
mirror...

02:58:46.334 --> 02:58:50.479
SAM: Well shit, I have an action, I can do
anything. I can do anything!

02:58:50.479 --> 02:58:55.539
TRAVIS: Yeah, you could play the fucking flute.

02:58:55.539 --> 02:58:57.993
SAM: What? What flute?

02:58:57.993 --> 02:58:59.911
LIAM: What are you saving it for?

02:58:59.911 --> 02:59:02.859
SAM: I play a shawm.

02:59:02.859 --> 02:59:06.206
LAURA: We're going to have to fight Raishan in a
second.

02:59:06.206 --> 02:59:08.592
MARISHA: This is far from over.

02:59:08.592 --> 02:59:12.780
TALIESIN: And whatever's in that pit. And
whatever's in that pit.

02:59:12.780 --> 02:59:14.654
SAM: What? How's she doing? Is she okay?

02:59:14.654 --> 02:59:15.945
LAURA: She's at 36.

02:59:15.945 --> 02:59:23.923
SAM: It's not great. All right, I will attack the
dragon. Bigby's Hand at level six. Why not?

02:59:23.923 --> 02:59:25.365
MATT: So you recast Bigby's Hand?

02:59:25.365 --> 02:59:26.700
MATT: All righty.

02:59:26.700 --> 02:59:28.882
LIAM: Give the people what they want.

02:59:28.882 --> 02:59:31.723
SAM: That is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; what they want.

02:59:31.723 --> 02:59:34.044
LAURA: Hey, he's got a hole in the middle of his
chest.

02:59:34.044 --> 02:59:36.405
SAM: I'll poke it.

02:59:36.405 --> 02:59:38.092
MATT: Go ahead and roll a spell attack.

02:59:38.092 --> 02:59:44.042
SAM: Nope. Did Pike help me out?

02:59:44.042 --> 02:59:49.710
LAURA: Yes! She casts her last War God's Blessing.
Add a ten to that.

02:59:49.710 --> 02:59:51.243
MATT: So plus ten to that.

02:59:51.243 --> 02:59:52.237
SAM: 23.

02:59:52.237 --> 02:59:55.405
MATT: 23 hits. So that would be?

02:59:55.405 --> 02:59:58.361
SAM: 6d8. Gimme.

02:59:58.361 --> 03:00:01.481
LIAM: Here comes the gnome.

03:00:01.481 --> 03:00:05.787
TALIESIN: Here's 4d8. 5d8. 6d8.

03:00:05.787 --> 03:00:12.354
SAM: 27.

03:00:12.354 --> 03:00:14.374
MATT: 27? Nice.

03:00:14.374 --> 03:00:17.649
LAURA: Every time!

03:00:17.649 --> 03:00:21.444
MATT: All right. Percival. Unless you want to
move, Scanlan.

03:00:21.444 --> 03:00:30.288
SAM: I moved to Pike to pour stuff in her. That's
all. I did not mean that in any weird way.

03:00:30.288 --> 03:00:31.902
MATT: Percival. Your turn.

03:00:31.902 --> 03:00:38.320
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to, for my bonus action,
I'm going to down a greater, which is 4d4, I

03:00:38.320 --> 03:00:39.477
believe?

03:00:39.477 --> 03:00:42.771
MATT: 4d4 plus four, yeah.

03:00:42.771 --> 03:00:51.183
LAURA: Did you add four to your 26 when you healed
her? Or did you just roll--

03:00:51.183 --> 03:01:01.002
TALIESIN: I'm dying less. I'm going to stand up.
I'm technically engaged with this bloody thing,

03:01:01.002 --> 03:01:02.100
aren't I?

03:01:02.100 --> 03:01:03.193
MATT: Correct.

03:01:03.193 --> 03:01:08.402
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm just going to-- There's little
I can do other than just say, please, somebody fix

03:01:08.402 --> 03:01:20.434
this, and I'm going to take two shots at the red
dragon. First shot with Bad News. 23?

03:01:20.434 --> 03:01:21.948
MATT: 23 hits.

03:01:21.948 --> 03:01:30.156
TALIESIN: I'm going to just throw-- forget it,
I'll throw four charges of Cabal's Ruin there.

03:01:30.156 --> 03:01:32.097
Let's just do it.

03:01:32.097 --> 03:01:34.367
MATT: That's an additional 4d6 damage.

03:01:34.367 --> 03:01:36.155
LIAM: Am I electrified, sitting on his head?

03:01:36.155 --> 03:01:42.741
TALIESIN: Technically speaking, no, the way that
this works-- it's like a Tesla arc, so it wouldn't

03:01:42.741 --> 03:01:45.521
technically-- you'll feel tingly.

03:01:45.521 --> 03:01:49.391
MATT: Your hair sticks up a little bit. Your
nipples get a little pointy.

03:01:49.391 --> 03:01:51.158
(laughter)

03:01:51.158 --> 03:01:53.427
MATT: Start shaking in the leather armor.

03:01:53.427 --> 03:01:55.041
LIAM: Do it again, Percy.

03:01:55.041 --> 03:01:57.009
(laughter)

03:01:57.009 --> 03:02:06.446
TALIESIN: Bloody fanart. Okay. And let's see what
kind of damage we do with this. Eh. That sucks.

03:02:06.446 --> 03:02:19.317
Stop it! Stop it! I can't count when-- that's
(counting) 21 points of damage. Stop saying that,

03:02:19.317 --> 03:02:21.842
it's 21! You don't know, it's 21.

03:02:21.842 --> 03:02:23.507
MATT: Okay.

03:02:23.507 --> 03:02:36.637
TALIESIN: Second shot. Can I reroll that, 'cause
he? Yeah, it misses. And now I'm going to die.

03:02:36.637 --> 03:02:41.805
You're like everything I hate about Overwatch.

03:02:41.805 --> 03:02:43.919
SAM: You're not going to die.

03:02:43.919 --> 03:02:50.765
MATT: One of the fingered claws of Thordak gets
blasted off from the impact from Bad News, the

03:02:50.765 --> 03:02:58.454
energy arcing through the rest of his arm from
Cabal's Ruin. The second shot, however, having to aim,

03:02:58.454 --> 03:03:04.206
manages to just barely miss Vax. He gets in the
way of the shot, and you have to shoot wide and it

03:03:04.206 --> 03:03:07.699
misses entirely. Is that your turn?

03:03:07.699 --> 03:03:11.805
TALIESIN: Yeah. That's my turn.

03:03:11.805 --> 03:03:23.221
MATT: At the end of Percy's turn, Thordak's going
to go ahead and use his third legendary action.

03:03:23.221 --> 03:03:25.156
SAM: To do what?

03:03:25.156 --> 03:03:34.010
MATT: To do a tail attack against Vax. That is a
22 to hit?

03:03:34.010 --> 03:03:40.015
LIAM: No. Nope. Nope. Hasted, 23, fuck you. Not
you.

03:03:40.015 --> 03:03:46.047
SAM: 23? Jesus! Where'd you go?

03:03:46.047 --> 03:04:00.206
MATT: All right. So that brings us to-- we're
going to say this will be... all right. The

03:04:00.206 --> 03:04:03.587
ground shakes.

03:04:03.587 --> 03:04:06.864
SAM: Oh, shit, I forgot about that. Lair actions.

03:04:06.864 --> 03:04:11.670
MATT: A 60-foot radius around the dragon, as just
the presence of Thordak, the ground just begins

03:04:11.670 --> 03:04:17.176
quaking beneath. You watch as fissures of small
volcanic energy begin to break from underneath.

03:04:17.176 --> 03:04:19.774
Pretty much everybody--

03:04:19.774 --> 03:04:21.236
SAM: Is Jarett in there?

03:04:21.236 --> 03:04:25.719
MATT: Yep. Except for you, who's in the air. Need
to make a dexterity saving throw.

03:04:25.719 --> 03:04:29.992
TALIESIN: Nope, rerolling that.

03:04:29.992 --> 03:04:33.063
SAM: Natural 20, 25.

03:04:33.063 --> 03:04:40.672
TALIESIN: I'm rerolling, because that was awful. Oh,
never mind.

03:04:40.672 --> 03:04:43.019
SAM: Yeah, if he doesn't like it, he gets to
reroll.

03:04:43.019 --> 03:04:44.758
MATT: It's a fighter ability.

03:04:44.758 --> 03:04:46.799
TALIESIN: Nine.

03:04:46.799 --> 03:04:50.466
LAURA: 30 for me.

03:04:50.466 --> 03:04:51.882
MATT: Pike?

03:04:51.882 --> 03:04:55.776
LAURA: Eight for Pike.

03:04:55.776 --> 03:04:57.084
TRAVIS: 11.

03:04:57.084 --> 03:04:59.029
LIAM: Not like this.

03:04:59.029 --> 03:05:11.248
MATT: Grog, Keyleth, Percy, Pike, Gilmore, all get
knocked prone from the ground quaking as you all

03:05:11.248 --> 03:05:16.502
fall on your back. You manage to brace yourself
against the wall real fast, Vex.

03:05:16.502 --> 03:05:18.527
SAM: Does Jarett get knocked to his feet?

03:05:18.527 --> 03:05:22.043
MATT: (laughs) No. He just gets shaken on the
ground.

03:05:22.043 --> 03:05:25.469
MARISHA: Popcorn on a trampoline.

03:05:25.469 --> 03:05:35.937
MATT: Raishan does not get her breath back. She
is, however, going to utilize Chain Lightning.

03:05:35.937 --> 03:05:38.689
MARISHA: Yeah, I want to see how this works.

03:05:38.689 --> 03:05:43.846
LAURA: She's going to hit us. No, she decides
where it hits.

03:05:43.846 --> 03:05:46.375
SAM: She's still on our side, right?

03:05:46.375 --> 03:05:48.079
TALIESIN: For another round or two.

03:05:48.079 --> 03:06:08.944
MATT: All right. Chain Lightning. Dexterity saving
throw. That's a success for Thordak. Sorry, I'm

03:06:08.944 --> 03:06:21.319
trying to get through this. Okay, so that is
halved. Halved, that is 18 points of lightning

03:06:21.319 --> 03:06:25.404
damage. Vax, make a dexterity saving throw.

03:06:25.404 --> 03:06:34.999
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck. Yeah. Good time to
use Luck. 26.

03:06:34.999 --> 03:06:42.410
MATT: 26, okay. You suffer 18 points of lightning
damage as the bolt of energy that strikes Thordak

03:06:42.410 --> 03:06:44.661
then arcs into you because you're right next to
it.

03:06:44.661 --> 03:06:49.192
LIAM: Would this be a new round for me to use
Evasion? I've lost track.

03:06:49.192 --> 03:06:54.100
LAURA: No, 'cause Thordak's already gone.

03:06:54.100 --> 03:07:07.287
MATT: No, you've already used it. So yeah. That
ends that. Going to take off and land right there

03:07:07.287 --> 03:07:09.125
next to that guy.

03:07:09.125 --> 03:07:11.481
LAURA: Who is that guy?

03:07:11.481 --> 03:07:16.697
MATT: That's the lizardman that fell from the
wyvern. Keyleth, you're up.

03:07:16.697 --> 03:07:20.201
LAURA: Dragon just landed on him, basically.

03:07:20.201 --> 03:07:21.881
SAM: I think he's got a shot.

03:07:21.881 --> 03:07:23.390
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

03:07:23.390 --> 03:07:31.735
MARISHA: Oh boy. Okay. I'm going to stand up.
Question. Is Thordak within 30 feet of fire giant dude?

03:07:31.735 --> 03:07:33.249
MATT: No.

03:07:33.249 --> 03:07:43.532
MARISHA: Okay. That answers my question, then. I'm going
to reach up and do Blight on Thordak, 'cause I

03:07:43.532 --> 03:07:45.057
think I can, this time.

03:07:45.057 --> 03:07:46.766
MATT: What's the range on Blight?

03:07:46.766 --> 03:07:49.094
MARISHA: 30 feet.

03:07:49.094 --> 03:07:51.370
MATT: Nope. Thordak is 50 feet in the air.

03:07:51.370 --> 03:07:58.061
MARISHA: Fucking shit fuck balls. Okay. Then--

03:07:58.061 --> 03:08:01.311
LAURA: Maybe you can jump and then cast it.

03:08:01.311 --> 03:08:03.302
MATT: You could climb up and cast it, if you
wanted to try that.

03:08:03.302 --> 03:08:09.396
MARISHA: No. I'm in a skirt situation. It's not
good.

03:08:09.396 --> 03:08:12.239
SAM: I'm not even paying attention, so if that's
your concern.

03:08:12.239 --> 03:08:23.882
MARISHA: No, it's just clumsy. Okay, I'm going to
do-- everything's not ideal right now!

03:08:23.882 --> 03:08:27.913
LAURA: Climb it, climb it, Keyleth! Just do it!

03:08:27.913 --> 03:08:29.683
LIAM: It's fucking end of the world!

03:08:29.683 --> 03:08:31.111
TALIESIN: They don't know.

03:08:31.111 --> 03:08:38.796
MARISHA: You don't know! I'm not good at that. I'm
bad at that thing. So I'm not a dextrous person,

03:08:38.796 --> 03:08:44.303
so instead I'm going to use my Spire of Conflux.

03:08:44.303 --> 03:08:46.478
SAM: Oh yeah, that Vestige thing!

03:08:46.478 --> 03:08:49.344
MARISHA: Look, I haven't forgotten about it, all
right?

03:08:49.344 --> 03:08:55.220
TRAVIS: Who are you talking to right now?

03:08:55.220 --> 03:08:59.839
MARISHA: My ancestors. And I'm going to do Chain
Lightning on Thordak.

03:08:59.839 --> 03:09:01.502
SAM: Oh! Another chain.

03:09:01.502 --> 03:09:09.281
MATT: All righty. Thordak's save is 19.

03:09:09.281 --> 03:09:12.032
MARISHA: Fail, motherfucker!

03:09:12.032 --> 03:09:17.594
MATT: Thordak's going to use his second legendary
resistance to make it. So go ahead and roll

03:09:17.594 --> 03:09:18.786
damage.

03:09:18.786 --> 03:09:23.181
MARISHA: Fine, that's fine. It's how many damage?
Like 8d10?

03:09:23.181 --> 03:09:24.519
MATT: 8d10.

03:09:24.519 --> 03:09:26.024
TALIESIN: Want some d10s?

03:09:26.024 --> 03:09:27.681
MARISHA: Yeah, I do.

03:09:27.681 --> 03:09:32.973
TALIESIN: Here's three more. How many are you at?

03:09:32.973 --> 03:09:42.332
MARISHA: I need one more. Oh, and I get to reroll
ones, right? That's actually really--

03:09:42.332 --> 03:09:46.176
TALIESIN: Whoa! Holy fuck.

03:09:46.176 --> 03:09:48.858
SAM: Is that a one?

03:09:48.858 --> 03:10:08.589
MARISHA: No, that's a seven. So that's 29, 34,
plus-- that's a seven. And then 34 plus 14 is 48.

03:10:08.589 --> 03:10:11.939
MATT: So half that is 24 points of lightning
damage.

03:10:11.939 --> 03:10:16.326
MARISHA: And there's no one else within 30 feet of
him, other than Raishan?

03:10:16.326 --> 03:10:19.306
MATT: Raishan's not even in that range.

03:10:19.306 --> 03:10:29.307
MARISHA: No one else? Well. Okay. I do that, and
then I turn around and I'm going to cast a

03:10:29.307 --> 03:10:31.166
Grasping Vine as a bonus action.

03:10:31.166 --> 03:10:32.428
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you.

03:10:32.428 --> 03:10:38.586
MARISHA: Right next to me. And then I'm going to
use it to whip around and grab Percy and--

03:10:38.586 --> 03:10:41.175
MATT: You do not have visual range on Percy right
now.

03:10:41.175 --> 03:10:46.270
MARISHA: I haven't used any movement. Can I shift
into that house a little bit?

03:10:46.270 --> 03:10:47.604
MATT: Sure, you move into the house?

03:10:47.604 --> 03:10:51.681
MARISHA: Uh-huh. And once again cast Grasping Vine
from out of that corner and drag Percy to me.

03:10:51.681 --> 03:10:52.730
MATT: Okay.

03:10:52.730 --> 03:10:55.096
MARISHA: Around the ankles.

03:10:55.096 --> 03:10:57.925
MATT: Still prone, but better.

03:10:57.925 --> 03:10:59.763
MARISHA: Hi.

03:10:59.763 --> 03:11:03.112
TALIESIN: Hi. That was really good. Ow.

03:11:03.112 --> 03:11:11.326
MATT: That end your turn? All right. Jarett's
turn. Jarett gets up. Jarett still only has a view

03:11:11.326 --> 03:11:21.539
of the dragon and is like, "What happened to--
that's weird." Missed the whole exchange. But gets

03:11:21.539 --> 03:11:30.700
the gist of it. Disadvantage. Misses. Natural 20,
disadvantage. 15, still hits. Not a critical,

03:11:30.700 --> 03:11:34.232
unfortunately. But a ten on damage, that's 13
piercing damage.

03:11:34.232 --> 03:11:37.043
LAURA: It didn't drop fear when he died?

03:11:37.043 --> 03:11:40.167
MATT: No, I think that would instill more fear.

03:11:40.167 --> 03:11:41.120
LAURA: Okay, just checking.

03:11:41.120 --> 03:11:43.289
(laughter)

03:11:43.289 --> 03:11:44.671
LAURA: Just checking.

03:11:44.671 --> 03:11:46.075
MATT: Logistically.

03:11:46.075 --> 03:11:48.163
LAURA: I didn't know if it was a reset when you
wake up.

03:11:48.163 --> 03:11:52.230
MATT: Right. Gilmore gets up from the ground.

03:11:52.230 --> 03:12:01.727
TALIESIN: I'm so distracted right now. There's too
much happening.

03:12:01.727 --> 03:12:18.359
MATT: So he's going to cast another 4th-level
Lightning Bolt. Thordak fails his save. Is going

03:12:18.359 --> 03:12:23.291
to use his last resistance to get that, 'cause
he's doing real rough.

03:12:23.291 --> 03:12:28.372
LAURA: You've got big-level spells, don't you,
still?

03:12:28.372 --> 03:12:30.082
SAM: Yeah, one.

03:12:30.082 --> 03:12:47.519
MATT: He's rolling shit tonight. 14 points of
lightning damage. No, 16. Okay. All righty. That's

03:12:47.519 --> 03:12:50.846
Gilmore's turn. It's Grog and Thordak's turn.

03:12:50.846 --> 03:12:53.137
TRAVIS: Oh, yes? I would like to stand up.

03:12:53.137 --> 03:12:54.601
MATT: Okay.

03:12:54.601 --> 03:12:57.838
TRAVIS: How high is Thordak?

03:12:57.838 --> 03:13:00.123
MATT: Thordak is 40 feet up.

03:13:00.123 --> 03:13:05.460
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch on a stick. Could I just
attach the bloodaxe and throw it at his much

03:13:05.460 --> 03:13:07.238
smaller foot, now?

03:13:07.238 --> 03:13:08.569
MATT: Sure.

03:13:08.569 --> 03:13:11.643
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I can only jump 20 feet in the
air. 15 feet in the air.

03:13:11.643 --> 03:13:13.312
LIAM: That'll do it, won't it?

03:13:13.312 --> 03:13:14.970
TRAVIS: He's 40 feet in the air.

03:13:14.970 --> 03:13:19.227
SAM: You don't know numbers. Maybe it'll work.

03:13:19.227 --> 03:13:25.122
TRAVIS: These hieroglyphs seem to indicate that
he's too high. Yeah, 'cause I'm only like 14 feet

03:13:25.122 --> 03:13:26.479
high, right?

03:13:26.479 --> 03:13:28.379
MATT: Right now? Yeah.

03:13:28.379 --> 03:13:38.443
TRAVIS: I'm reckless throwing the bushwhacker.

03:13:38.443 --> 03:13:42.168
LAURA: (gasps) He got another natural 20!

03:13:42.168 --> 03:13:43.360
SAM: Holy shit!

03:13:43.360 --> 03:13:45.251
MATT: You have advantage. Roll again.

03:13:45.251 --> 03:13:46.310
TRAVIS: Ten.

03:13:46.310 --> 03:13:51.696
LAURA: That's a really pretty die that he's got,
too. Sparkly.

03:13:51.696 --> 03:13:54.128
MARISHA: She's getting ideas.

03:13:54.128 --> 03:14:12.943
TRAVIS: (counting) 34, 37, 38. 38 points of
damage.

03:14:12.943 --> 03:14:18.096
MATT: 38 points of damage.

03:14:18.096 --> 03:14:22.845
TALIESIN: That with your bonus? I just said that
randomly, I don't actually know any of your

03:14:22.845 --> 03:14:25.005
bonuses, I just thought maybe it would jog
something.

03:14:25.005 --> 03:14:32.174
TRAVIS: With my movement, can I run nuts towards
where the fire giant is?

03:14:32.174 --> 03:14:38.379
MATT: Sure. You can get right there.

03:14:38.379 --> 03:14:42.224
TRAVIS: That'll work. I need a new plaything
that'll actually stay.

03:14:42.224 --> 03:14:50.022
MATT: Thordak, who is physically falling apart at
this point, sections just sloughing off, and just

03:14:50.022 --> 03:14:59.585
the whole experience has been sending his
physical-- his whole physical form is wrecked

03:14:59.585 --> 03:15:05.637
right now. The word escapes me that I was looking
for. He's going to go ahead and turn and go into a

03:15:05.637 --> 03:15:07.023
full flight.

03:15:07.023 --> 03:15:08.684
LIAM: I'm riding him.

03:15:08.684 --> 03:15:09.827
MATT: You're riding him?

03:15:09.827 --> 03:15:11.640
LIAM: Yeah. Shit yeah, I'm riding him.

03:15:11.640 --> 03:15:14.378
MARISHA: Oh, no. No, Vax, no.

03:15:14.378 --> 03:15:15.900
TALIESIN: Vax is good.

03:15:15.900 --> 03:15:18.229
LAURA: No!

03:15:18.229 --> 03:15:21.202
MATT: Dash into the dark hole within.

03:15:21.202 --> 03:15:22.541
TALIESIN: This is good.

03:15:22.541 --> 03:15:24.150
LAURA: Why is this good?

03:15:24.150 --> 03:15:25.542
SAM: A dark hole?

03:15:25.542 --> 03:15:29.171
LAURA: Vax, be careful!

03:15:29.171 --> 03:15:31.169
TRAVIS: We don't care about the tunnel, huh?

03:15:31.169 --> 03:15:33.283
(laughter)

03:15:33.283 --> 03:15:39.367
MATT: You need to go ahead and roll a strength
saving throw to try and maintain grip as the

03:15:39.367 --> 03:15:41.756
dragon goes into a full dive.

03:15:41.756 --> 03:15:47.828
LIAM: I'll use my last Luck. So it's a 15.

03:15:47.828 --> 03:15:56.436
MATT: 15. You do manage to make it inside the
tunnel, but you lose your grip and then go into a

03:15:56.436 --> 03:16:03.247
full tumble, hitting the ground. It's a decline,
it's a 45-degree angle downward.

03:16:03.247 --> 03:16:04.792
LIAM: So I'm in there with him.

03:16:04.792 --> 03:16:08.732
MATT: Yes. Roll an acrobatics check to stop
yourself.

03:16:08.732 --> 03:16:10.436
LIAM: That is a 25.

03:16:10.436 --> 03:16:14.518
MATT: 25, okay. So you do tumble and come to a
stop. You don't take any damage from the fall, and

03:16:14.518 --> 03:16:19.970
you stop yourself from doing a tumble, but it is
still a decline into darkness below, and you just

03:16:19.970 --> 03:16:25.517
watch as the back end of Thordak's barely flying
form slams into the side of the tunnel and

03:16:25.517 --> 03:16:27.357
continues swooping away.

03:16:27.357 --> 03:16:29.377
LIAM: Do I still see him with darkvision at this
point?

03:16:29.377 --> 03:16:32.590
MATT: He just begins to leave outside of your
darkvision.

03:16:32.590 --> 03:16:37.202
LIAM: Are we still in the same chain of
initiative?

03:16:37.202 --> 03:16:48.556
MATT: As of right now, we are, yes. So. Finishing,
that is Thordak's go. Vex, you're up.

03:16:48.556 --> 03:17:01.240
LAURA: Okay. I run after him and dive after him,
because I saw that. And at the edge of my

03:17:01.240 --> 03:17:08.732
movement, I want to hop out on my broom and get
ready to fly down the hole after.

03:17:08.732 --> 03:17:13.782
MATT: Okay. So you are hasted, so you get down and
you basically have just enough movement to catch

03:17:13.782 --> 03:17:19.035
up to your brother. And you get the broom out.
You're both down there in the darkness by

03:17:19.035 --> 03:17:23.477
yourselves. You guys watch as the rest of them
dive into the hole. Vax, you're up.

03:17:23.477 --> 03:17:25.677
LIAM: How far away from me is he?

03:17:25.677 --> 03:17:27.360
MATT: How far does your darkvision go for?

03:17:27.360 --> 03:17:28.576
LIAM: 60 feet.

03:17:28.576 --> 03:17:29.880
MATT: He's outside of your darkvision.

03:17:29.880 --> 03:17:34.128
LIAM: Then I am going to use my movement and go
120 feet, or until I see him.

03:17:34.128 --> 03:17:38.191
LAURA: Can I cast-- 'cause I didn't do an attack,
right?

03:17:38.191 --> 03:17:43.468
MATT: This is happening after your turn. So you
begin to dart forward?

03:17:43.468 --> 03:17:46.427
LIAM: This is just my movement. 120 feet or until
I'm on him.

03:17:46.427 --> 03:17:50.263
MATT: Well, your movement is not 120 feet. You're
still flying through there?

03:17:50.263 --> 03:17:51.708
LIAM: Yes, I'm flying.

03:17:51.708 --> 03:17:56.791
MATT: Right, so your wings are still out there.
Okay. Okay. So yeah, you begin to come in, you see

03:17:56.791 --> 03:17:59.264
him just begin to come into your visual range.

03:17:59.264 --> 03:18:00.992
LIAM: Still away from me?

03:18:00.992 --> 03:18:02.068
MATT: Still away from you.

03:18:02.068 --> 03:18:05.066
LIAM: Then I'm going to use a bonus action to dash
and hit his back, and land on his back.

03:18:05.066 --> 03:18:07.755
MATT: Okay. You land on his back.

03:18:07.755 --> 03:18:16.638
LIAM: Attack, attack. First attack is a--
scheisse. 24.

03:18:16.638 --> 03:18:21.863
MATT: I would say you have disadvantage on these
strikes, as you're currently gripping onto a

03:18:21.863 --> 03:18:25.831
flying dragon underneath a cavern ripping through.
You have advantage on them automatically, which

03:18:25.831 --> 03:18:29.421
means you don't have disadvantage on these
strikes, but you do not get the automatic sneak

03:18:29.421 --> 03:18:30.809
attack.

03:18:30.809 --> 03:18:32.651
LIAM: I don't remember-- oh, I don't get the
automatic sneak attack?

03:18:32.651 --> 03:18:33.538
MATT: No.

03:18:33.538 --> 03:18:34.613
LIAM: But I got advantage?

03:18:34.613 --> 03:18:38.623
MATT: No. Essentially, you would have advantage,
and then trying to grip onto him and through the

03:18:38.623 --> 03:18:41.087
middle of this tunnel and slamming into him, you
would have disadvantage, and so they both cancel

03:18:41.087 --> 03:18:42.522
to just a regular attack.

03:18:42.522 --> 03:18:43.836
LIAM: All right, so 24 for the first.

03:18:43.836 --> 03:18:44.859
MATT: What was the first one?

03:18:44.859 --> 03:18:45.686
LIAM: 24.

03:18:45.686 --> 03:18:46.604
MATT: 24 hits.

03:18:46.604 --> 03:18:47.843
LIAM: Second one is a natural 20.

03:18:47.843 --> 03:18:49.977
MATT: Second one was a natural 20? All right.

03:18:49.977 --> 03:19:10.230
LIAM: So the first one's the dragon-slaying.
Three, eight, 14, 19, plus Hunter's Mark. So

03:19:10.230 --> 03:19:11.865
there's no sneak attack on this, right, you said?

03:19:11.865 --> 03:19:13.335
MATT: Correct.

03:19:13.335 --> 03:19:16.428
LIAM: 21 with the dragon-slayer.

03:19:16.428 --> 03:19:18.154
MATT: 21, nice.

03:19:18.154 --> 03:19:35.961
LIAM: And then Whisper, which is a natural 20, is
one plus that is nine, plus the-- six is 15, plus

03:19:35.961 --> 03:19:39.538
Hunter's Mark. 17.

03:19:39.538 --> 03:19:41.083
LAURA: Times two?

03:19:41.083 --> 03:19:42.985
LIAM: Oh. 15 times two is 30.

03:19:42.985 --> 03:19:46.592
LAURA: It's all times two, 'cause that's all--
well, 15 times two is 30.

03:19:46.592 --> 03:19:50.981
LIAM: 30 plus eight. 38.

03:19:50.981 --> 03:19:51.790
MATT: Okay.

03:19:51.790 --> 03:19:52.984
How do you want to do this?

03:19:52.984 --> 03:19:54.578
(yelling)

03:19:54.578 --> 03:19:55.695
LAURA: In the dark. Alone.

03:19:55.695 --> 03:19:57.105
SAM: In a dark pit.

03:19:57.105 --> 03:20:05.981
LIAM: With Whisper, I'm going to shove it in so
that my hand disappears from view, so I'm up to my

03:20:05.981 --> 03:20:12.691
forearm, and stab as far in as I can reach.

03:20:12.691 --> 03:20:21.301
I hear the voice of my mother in the morning. Fuck
you.

03:20:21.301 --> 03:20:29.918
MATT: As the blade plunges into Thordak's
now-sloughing and soft flesh, exposed through a

03:20:29.918 --> 03:20:33.964
series of wounds and gashes left behind by your
allies, and his form just slowly shriveling into

03:20:33.964 --> 03:20:42.344
its diminutive space, the dagger cuts cleanly
through, and with that force you go all the way up

03:20:42.344 --> 03:20:51.031
to the shoulder as you reach inside. As you finish
saying your phrase, your eyes narrow and you

03:20:51.031 --> 03:20:59.979
clench your teeth, and as you pull back and yank,
there's this strange series of low whispers that

03:20:59.979 --> 03:21:08.252
come into your ears, and as you pull back, you
watch as these bits of greyish energy begin to

03:21:08.252 --> 03:21:15.384
pour out of the air, coalescing around the blade,
fitting into the body where you're currently

03:21:15.384 --> 03:21:22.179
plunged within. As you yank outward, you watch as
the blade almost has an extended edge about ten,

03:21:22.179 --> 03:21:27.834
15 feet beyond Whisper's actual-- and this blade
edge just leaves a giant wound on the side of

03:21:27.834 --> 03:21:39.266
Thordak's body. You don't even hear an exclamation
of pain as Thordak just slowly slams into the

03:21:39.266 --> 03:21:52.686
ground of this low, barely glowing tunnel. Roll an
acrobatics check with disadvantage.

03:21:52.686 --> 03:21:53.910
LIAM: 25.

03:21:53.910 --> 03:21:54.868
MATT: 25.

03:21:54.868 --> 03:21:56.281
SAM: Jesus.

03:21:56.281 --> 03:22:01.087
MATT: So with the speed and impact of tumbling,
you manage to reduce the damage by half, so you--

03:22:01.087 --> 03:22:03.754
LIAM: Which is also halved by the potion.

03:22:03.754 --> 03:22:06.566
MATT: Right. That is 17 points of bludgeoning
damage.

03:22:06.566 --> 03:22:09.296
LIAM: Is that the quarter?

03:22:09.296 --> 03:22:18.174
MATT: No, that's halved. So that would bring it to
8. As you watch Thordak's form sputter, roll, and

03:22:18.174 --> 03:22:23.884
then tumble, grinding to a halt, gathering a bunch
of stone, broken rock, and part of the cavern

03:22:23.884 --> 03:22:29.513
that's on the verge of collapsing from the impact
of Thordak's body, now lifeless, still in the

03:22:29.513 --> 03:22:32.115
darkness, subterranean tunnel.

03:22:32.115 --> 03:22:34.117
And we're going to take a break.

03:22:34.117 --> 03:22:38.857
(yelling)

03:22:38.857 --> 03:22:52.976
TRAVIS: We don't even know it's happened, though,
yet! It's all underground!

03:22:52.976 --> 03:22:55.736
TALIESIN: She would know.

03:22:55.798 --> 03:22:59.535
LAURA: I do know. Can I fly forward before we take
the break?

03:22:59.535 --> 03:23:01.143
MATT: You want to?

03:23:01.143 --> 03:23:07.619
LAURA: I just want to fly forward and hug my
brother as he's just covered in dragon guts.

03:23:07.619 --> 03:23:12.273
TALIESIN: He's way down in there. That's a long
flight.

03:23:12.273 --> 03:23:23.764
MATT: And now we'll take a break. So we'll be back
here in a few minutes.

03:23:23.764 --> 03:23:31.533
SAM: Don't forget, Backblaze is hosting a Critical
Role giveaway. Anyone who signs up for a free

03:23:31.533 --> 03:23:37.034
trial with Backblaze at backblaze.com/criticalrole
through January 8th will be eligible to win items

03:23:37.034 --> 03:23:40.503
signed by the Critical Role team that killed a
dragon.

03:23:40.503 --> 03:23:44.493
MATT: Check out the video here during the break,
and we'll be back in a few minutes, guys.

03:23:44.493 --> 03:37:21.343
[break]

03:37:21.343 --> 03:37:26.325
MATT: Welcome back, everybody. First and foremost,
we have our winner in the chat for the Wyrmwood

03:37:26.325 --> 03:37:29.174
dice tray. It is DetectiveKane!

03:37:29.174 --> 03:37:32.128
(cheering)

03:37:32.128 --> 03:37:37.509
MATT: You'll receive this awesome dice tray signed
by us. Half of us at the break, and the other half

03:37:37.509 --> 03:37:41.048
will sign before the night is out. But it's coming
your way real soon. Congratulations,

03:37:41.048 --> 03:37:44.243
DetectiveKane! Get this out of my fucking face!

03:37:44.243 --> 03:37:45.754
LAURA: Nobody's there.

03:37:45.754 --> 03:37:47.575
MATT: Somebody take it from me!

03:37:47.575 --> 03:37:50.188
SAM: I don't even know that guy!

03:37:50.188 --> 03:37:55.461
TALIESIN: I think I see half a dozen people on
their phones behind us.

03:37:55.461 --> 03:38:01.004
MATT: It feels so good to be able to do that, but
it feels better when it's immediate. Otherwise, it

03:38:01.004 --> 03:38:10.745
feels, like, kinda good. All right, so. Picking up
where we left off. The rest of you watch as

03:38:10.745 --> 03:38:18.295
Thordak swooped into the hole that he emerged
from, quickly followed by Vex and Vax. There is

03:38:18.295 --> 03:38:24.898
still on the field-- Raishan just tore into this
lizard man. We have a fire giant that is unscathed

03:38:24.898 --> 03:38:30.460
currently, bearing down on the rest of the party,
and a wyvern rider back around this wall section

03:38:30.460 --> 03:38:46.230
here. That being the case, they end that turn
there. First up is Lady Kima. Who is pissed that

03:38:46.230 --> 03:38:49.785
she hasn't had a chance to really do anything
tonight against flying dragons.

03:38:49.785 --> 03:38:51.580
TRAVIS: There's a big fire giant.

03:38:51.580 --> 03:38:53.495
MATT: That's what she's going to do.

03:38:53.495 --> 03:39:01.005
Paladins that don't fly and have haste have
a hard time getting around. Just so you know.

03:39:01.005 --> 03:39:04.629
LAURA: Vestige!

03:39:04.629 --> 03:39:13.345
MATT: Watching this giant whale upon Percy pisses
her off, and she cracks her neck. "You're first."

03:39:13.345 --> 03:39:15.144
And she leaps down.

03:39:15.144 --> 03:39:17.643
TRAVIS: Open him up!

03:39:17.643 --> 03:39:32.726
MATT: And she's going to multi-attack against him.
That is-- that hits. And the other also hits. Even

03:39:32.726 --> 03:39:40.372
with a minus five on each for her Great Weapon
Master. She's also going to Divine Smite on that

03:39:40.372 --> 03:39:41.702
at a level three.

03:39:41.702 --> 03:39:43.269
TRAVIS: Yeah, get it!

03:39:43.269 --> 03:40:04.099
MATT: First strike is a 14, plus ten, 24. Plus 11,
35. 42 points of damage on her first strike

03:40:04.099 --> 03:40:05.270
against the giant.

03:40:05.270 --> 03:40:06.785
TRAVIS: Boom!

03:40:06.785 --> 03:40:22.870
MATT: And the second strike is 24 points of
damage. So that fire giant's already had a big

03:40:22.870 --> 03:40:29.841
chunk taken out of its-- Kima rushes up and double
strikes with her Holy Avenger, one cleaving off a

03:40:29.841 --> 03:40:34.691
piece of its armor, the second one cuts through,
leaving a giant flash of divine energy as it

03:40:34.691 --> 03:40:44.359
bursts out the side. She looks up in the eyes and
says, "Bahamut says hi." That ends Kima's turn.

03:40:44.359 --> 03:40:46.808
Pike is up now.

03:40:46.808 --> 03:40:49.076
SAM: Oh, how's Pike doing?

03:40:49.076 --> 03:40:52.905
LAURA: Pike-- oh, Pike's turn! Jesus.

03:40:52.905 --> 03:40:54.390
LIAM: She's doing great.

03:40:54.390 --> 03:40:55.706
TRAVIS: Head out of ass.

03:40:55.706 --> 03:40:57.085
LAURA: I'm sorry! Okay.

03:40:57.085 --> 03:40:58.494
LIAM: She's in Manhattan.

03:40:58.494 --> 03:40:59.654
LAURA: She stands up.

03:40:59.654 --> 03:41:13.239
MATT: Technically-- I was going to say, the giant
was going on Thordak's turn order. So I

03:41:13.239 --> 03:41:18.100
technically skipped the giant's turn. That's fine.
I'll do the giant's turn now.

03:41:18.100 --> 03:41:19.446
LAURA: Okay.

03:41:19.446 --> 03:41:26.673
MATT: The giant, who has watched Percy get pulled away,
steps in to get into melee range with both Kima

03:41:26.673 --> 03:41:27.681
and Grog.

03:41:27.681 --> 03:41:29.271
TRAVIS: That's such a mistake.

03:41:29.271 --> 03:41:38.576
MATT: And is going to take a strike on each. Takes
an attack on Kima and rolls-- that's a 20, that

03:41:38.576 --> 03:41:44.401
hits. And then roll Grog-- that is a 29.

03:41:44.401 --> 03:41:45.743
TRAVIS: That hits.

03:41:45.743 --> 03:42:05.606
MATT: That's 28 points of damage to Kima and--
it's fun to roll against the players. 33 points of

03:42:05.606 --> 03:42:08.633
slashing damage against you, Grog.

03:42:08.633 --> 03:42:10.258
TRAVIS: So halved to, math?

03:42:10.258 --> 03:42:11.235
MATT: 16.

03:42:11.235 --> 03:42:24.233
TRAVIS: Thank you. I will use my Retaliation. The
old chin turned back. Reckless. Great Weapon

03:42:24.233 --> 03:42:32.709
Master. That's better. 21.

03:42:32.709 --> 03:42:34.787
MATT: 21. That hits.

03:42:34.787 --> 03:42:45.921
TRAVIS: Nice. 21, that was crap. And 22. Both
ones. 22 plus ten is 32.

03:42:45.921 --> 03:42:52.848
MATT: 32 points of damage, nice. The giant already
in that round of attacks and your retaliation is--

03:42:52.848 --> 03:43:00.844
it has its giant greatsword on the ground, it's
rearing up for its next round of arcing attacks.

03:43:00.844 --> 03:43:04.513
That brings us to Pike. What's Pike doing now?

03:43:04.513 --> 03:43:18.337
LAURA: Okay, Pike stands up. She's going to run
forward and say, "You can't have all the fun,

03:43:18.337 --> 03:43:29.493
"Grog!" And she's going to Guiding Bolt, level
four, at the fire giant.

03:43:29.493 --> 03:43:32.188
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll a melee spell
attack.

03:43:32.188 --> 03:43:40.794
LAURA: Okay, okay. Okay, that's 18.

03:43:40.794 --> 03:43:42.265
MATT: 18 just hits.

03:43:42.265 --> 03:43:46.600
LAURA: Okay. Oh, wait. 17.

03:43:46.600 --> 03:43:48.012
MATT: Nope.

03:43:48.012 --> 03:43:49.760
LIAM: 17 sounds like 18.

03:43:49.760 --> 03:43:54.515
MATT: It does, but it's not the same. The giant
sees the flash of light as the bolt comes towards

03:43:54.515 --> 03:44:00.470
it, out the corner of its eye. As it has its blade
down, it instead ducks underneath, using Grog for

03:44:00.470 --> 03:44:06.263
cover briefly as it arcs past its shoulder and
shoots off through the cloud, out of sight.

03:44:06.263 --> 03:44:12.550
MARISHA: What if it was 17.99? That's basically
like 18.

03:44:12.550 --> 03:44:13.796
MATT: It's not.

03:44:13.796 --> 03:44:15.215
LIAM: Crazy Eddie prices?

03:44:15.215 --> 03:44:17.629
TRAVIS: Taco Bell logic right there.

03:44:17.629 --> 03:44:27.201
LAURA: She says, "So, sorry! I guess you do have
all the fun. How are you on hit points, Grog? You okay?"

03:44:27.201 --> 03:44:28.513
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:44:28.513 --> 03:44:31.718
LAURA: Okay, then she's going to Healing Word
herself at first level.

03:44:31.718 --> 03:44:34.702
MATT: Okay. d4 plus five.

03:44:34.702 --> 03:44:38.324
LAURA: Okay, that's six points.

03:44:38.324 --> 03:44:41.341
MATT: There you go. Six points to Pike. Scanlan,
you're up.

03:44:41.341 --> 03:44:44.155
SAM: We're fighting this fucking giant thing?

03:44:44.155 --> 03:44:45.436
LIAM: Yeah, man.

03:44:45.436 --> 03:44:58.340
SAM: Jesus. I'm going to move out from my hidey
hole. Oh god, there's a giant there. I think my

03:44:58.340 --> 03:45:04.315
Bigby's is still on the field, yeah. So I'll
Bigby's Punch. Bigby Punch!

03:45:04.315 --> 03:45:08.726
MATT: Yeah, Bigby could just get into range melee
there for it.

03:45:08.726 --> 03:45:13.723
SAM: A 24?

03:45:13.723 --> 03:45:16.044
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll your 6d8.

03:45:16.044 --> 03:45:21.012
SAM: 6d8, oh man. I only have one d8. I'll roll it
six times.

03:45:21.012 --> 03:45:22.429
MARISHA: Do you want some d8s?

03:45:22.429 --> 03:45:23.862
SAM: I'll roll it six times.

03:45:23.862 --> 03:45:26.408
MARISHA: No, that's-- oh, he's already committed.

03:45:26.408 --> 03:45:31.839
TRAVIS: Mad d8's. Oh, he's stroking out.

03:45:31.839 --> 03:45:34.103
MARISHA: Should we do what he does to us? 15!

03:45:34.103 --> 03:45:35.506
SAM: That was four.

03:45:35.506 --> 03:45:38.398
TRAVIS: Flirted with the edge.

03:45:38.398 --> 03:45:40.439
LAURA: 15. 15.

03:45:40.439 --> 03:45:41.549
TALIESIN: 23.

03:45:41.549 --> 03:45:42.648
MARISHA: 15.

03:45:42.648 --> 03:45:44.075
SAM: You fuckers!

03:45:44.075 --> 03:45:45.948
TALIESIN: This doesn't feel good on the other end,
does it?

03:45:45.948 --> 03:45:53.038
SAM: Oh, shit, that was a lot! It's either 33 or
34, they fucked me up. But it was a lot! It was

03:45:53.038 --> 03:45:54.706
mostly sevens and eights!

03:45:54.706 --> 03:46:00.537
MATT: We'll go with 34 on that. Cool. So, as the
giant ducks out of the way of the Guiding Bolt

03:46:00.537 --> 03:46:05.755
streaking past, it snickers and grins, says
something in Giant which you hear, which is--

03:46:05.755 --> 03:46:07.171
TRAVIS: (gasps)

03:46:07.171 --> 03:46:09.707
MATT: You didn't even hear what he said yet!

03:46:09.707 --> 03:46:14.431
TRAVIS: Oh. I will hold my reaction.

03:46:14.431 --> 03:46:19.293
MATT: "Insolents, bow to your king!"

03:46:19.293 --> 03:46:21.642
TRAVIS: No.

03:46:21.642 --> 03:46:26.827
MATT: And then, as it brings the sword up, while
it saw the glimmer of the Guiding Bolt, it didn't

03:46:26.827 --> 03:46:31.360
see the purple glimmer of the shining fist as it
comes up and whack right across the jaw,

03:46:31.360 --> 03:46:37.463
dislocating it briefly as the fist comes back up
and is ready for another round. Still standing,

03:46:37.463 --> 03:46:40.781
but looking pretty rough. That brings us to--

03:46:40.781 --> 03:46:45.890
SAM: That was my bonus action. As my action, I
will swig a Greater Healing Potion.

03:46:45.890 --> 03:46:47.369
MATT: Okay.

03:46:47.369 --> 03:46:48.733
SAM: What is that, four?

03:46:48.733 --> 03:46:51.327
MATT: Greater Healing Potion is 4d4 plus four,
yeah.

03:46:51.327 --> 03:46:53.604
TALIESIN: Oh, 4d4 plus six!

03:46:53.604 --> 03:47:04.378
SAM: Yeah, the potion doesn't do that for me, does
it? Plus four? Four, three, two, one is ten, right?

03:47:04.378 --> 03:47:07.861
MATT: Yes. So 14 hit points you heal.

03:47:07.861 --> 03:47:15.150
LAURA: When you were healing Pike with the
superior, did you add--

03:47:15.150 --> 03:47:17.236
SAM: You're right, it's two less than I thought.

03:47:17.236 --> 03:47:20.729
LAURA: Oh, okay. So she's at 40 healed points now,
not 42.

03:47:20.729 --> 03:47:27.466
SAM: I get a plus six when I cast it, because of
my awesomeness.

03:47:27.466 --> 03:47:28.563
MATT: Correct.

03:47:28.563 --> 03:47:29.801
SAM: But not when I use a potion.

03:47:29.801 --> 03:47:30.691
MATT: Correct.

03:47:30.691 --> 03:47:31.789
SAM: Got it.

03:47:31.789 --> 03:47:36.716
MATT: All righty. Scanlan, that finish your turn?

03:47:36.716 --> 03:47:38.391
SAM: Yeah, I think I'm done.

03:47:38.391 --> 03:47:39.524
MATT: Percival.

03:47:39.524 --> 03:47:46.838
TALIESIN: I'm going to put Bad News away, pull out
Animus and take three shots at this asshole.

03:47:46.838 --> 03:47:48.435
MATT: Okay. So are you getting up?

03:47:48.435 --> 03:47:54.017
TALIESIN: I'm getting up. Pulling out the gun,
putting three sharpshooter shots in this guy.

03:47:54.017 --> 03:47:55.523
MATT: Go for it.

03:47:55.523 --> 03:48:06.186
TALIESIN: That's a 26. That hits. I'm going to
roll that one until he drops, so that I can-- 1d8

03:48:06.186 --> 03:48:14.905
plus 1d6. 1d10 plus 1d6. That's 18, 19, 20, 21. 21
points of damage plus four points of psychic

03:48:14.905 --> 03:48:17.014
damage, so 25 points of damage.

03:48:17.014 --> 03:48:18.820
MATT: All righty.

03:48:18.820 --> 03:48:26.905
TALIESIN: Second shot. That's 21 to hit.

03:48:26.905 --> 03:48:28.133
MATT: Hits.

03:48:28.133 --> 03:48:32.505
SAM: Right? Plus three plus two plus one...

03:48:32.505 --> 03:48:42.143
TALIESIN: That's... Not right now, you bastard! I
hate you! That's 27 plus... 27 points of damage

03:48:42.143 --> 03:48:46.443
plus one point of psychic damage to me because I
can't think!

03:48:46.443 --> 03:48:49.051
MARISHA: He needs horse blinders! Horse blinders!

03:48:49.051 --> 03:48:54.174
TALIESIN: So 27 points of damage plus one... I'm
so sorry.

03:48:54.174 --> 03:48:56.466
SAM: What goes around comes around!

03:48:56.466 --> 03:49:03.834
MATT: So as the fist clocks him across the face,
dislocating the jaw, it stands up and grabs the

03:49:03.834 --> 03:49:11.098
jaw and snaps it back into place. Looks up just in
time for you to come up out of the shadow and

03:49:11.098 --> 03:49:16.845
(gunshots), turning the barrels, you fire, and the
first shot hits in the side of the throat and

03:49:16.845 --> 03:49:21.995
blows open the neck. And you see as the blood
begins to gout out, reaches up with a hand and it

03:49:21.995 --> 03:49:26.918
(gasps) but it's to no use as the other shot takes
out the right eye, blowing out the back of the

03:49:26.918 --> 03:49:28.747
giant's head as it falls backward.

03:49:28.747 --> 03:49:33.486
SAM: Violence, violence! Who would've thought a
fire giant would be so easy?

03:49:33.486 --> 03:49:36.724
TALIESIN: I am now going to start making my way to
the-- I'm going to start running my way to the

03:49:36.724 --> 03:49:40.328
pit. With what little movement I have because I
got up.

03:49:40.328 --> 03:49:47.029
MATT: Okay. All right, that ends Percy's turn. Top
of the round, the lair actions do not function.

03:49:47.029 --> 03:49:53.834
However, you watch as the skyship Deera, still
rotating around, there's still wyverns attacking.

03:49:53.834 --> 03:49:59.254
You hear the distant sounds of lightning cracks as
well. And you hear very, very distantly what

03:49:59.254 --> 03:50:11.713
sounds like a-- sorry, internet-- a cacophony of
voices. Because there's no other word to describe

03:50:11.713 --> 03:50:19.931
it. Hundreds and hundreds of voices, all shouting
combat war cries simultaneously. You have no idea

03:50:19.931 --> 03:50:25.683
how far away it is, it's very, very faint, you
just pick it up. You hear the sound of impacts, of

03:50:25.683 --> 03:50:30.908
crumbling stone in the distance. There is a battle
happening all throughout the city that is slowly

03:50:30.908 --> 03:50:40.011
making its way towards your current location.
Deera's turned around and is going to take two

03:50:40.011 --> 03:50:45.785
shots at Raishan, because it's going to fire at
whatever dragons are there. Damon was not notified

03:50:45.785 --> 03:50:47.232
of anything otherwise.

03:50:47.232 --> 03:50:49.634
LAURA: You know what, if Raishan gets hit, she
gets hit.

03:50:49.634 --> 03:50:54.731
MATT: Rolled an eight, and an eight. No, it does
not hit. Oh, she gets three attacks, because the--

03:50:54.731 --> 03:50:58.018
TRAVIS: What?

03:50:58.018 --> 03:51:05.233
MATT: Three eights in a row. That's ridiculous.
Yeah! That's not a three, that's an eight. Absurd.

03:51:05.233 --> 03:51:12.380
So yeah, (boom, boom, boom) all on the ground, and
Raishan spins in place (growls), "Call off your

03:51:12.380 --> 03:51:14.669
"dogs! We still have a deal!"

03:51:14.669 --> 03:51:17.623
TRAVIS: We literally have no power over them.

03:51:17.623 --> 03:51:20.630
TALIESIN: I'll respond. To the pit! Now!

03:51:20.630 --> 03:51:26.485
MATT: Which, Raishan at this point is now leaping
(whoosh) and disappears into the portal-- or down

03:51:26.485 --> 03:51:28.196
into the hole in the ground.

03:51:28.196 --> 03:51:31.284
TALIESIN: She was already going that way, she
doesn't get into shit with that.

03:51:31.284 --> 03:51:33.093
LAURA: I want her to get hit.

03:51:33.093 --> 03:51:35.511
TALIESIN: She's not going to get-- She's going in
the tunnel.

03:51:35.511 --> 03:51:49.008
MATT: All right. At this point, full speed, that
is-- 60 feet, yeah. You guys, as you're having

03:51:49.008 --> 03:51:50.929
this moment hugging each other--

03:51:50.929 --> 03:51:52.797
LAURA: Hugs!

03:51:52.797 --> 03:52:00.736
MATT: You hear (wings flapping) (smash) The ground
shakes nearby as you turn and see, you watch as

03:52:00.736 --> 03:52:08.070
Raishan skids to a halt right next to you and the
currently smashed corpse of Thordak within the

03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:09.464
tunnel.

03:52:09.464 --> 03:52:17.017
MARISHA: Can I say over like a headpiece thing--
Be like, twins, if you're still alive, I think

03:52:17.017 --> 03:52:19.250
Raishan's coming in your direction.

03:52:19.250 --> 03:52:21.536
LIAM: Thanks for that.

03:52:21.536 --> 03:52:29.225
MATT: Raishan is watching both of you as she
begins to walk towards Thordak's corpse and goes,

03:52:29.225 --> 03:52:32.737
"You've done well."

03:52:32.737 --> 03:52:35.478
LIAM: Yeah, what now?

03:52:35.478 --> 03:52:37.503
TALIESIN: Every six seconds, we get to move.

03:52:37.503 --> 03:52:40.994
MARISHA: Yeah, we're heading ass-- Hauling ass
that way!

03:52:40.994 --> 03:52:42.727
TALIESIN: Booking with my spider walk.

03:52:42.727 --> 03:52:44.381
LAURA: I'm heading ass-wherever!

03:52:44.381 --> 03:52:47.124
TALIESIN: Running down the ceiling upside-down.

03:52:47.124 --> 03:52:50.950
TRAVIS: Not me, I'm putting out that last fire on
the map.

03:52:50.950 --> 03:52:55.369
LAURA: Stomp, stomp, stomp!

03:52:55.369 --> 03:52:56.973
SAM: He's volunteer fire department, yeah.

03:52:56.973 --> 03:52:59.744
MATT: 80 foot flying, this wyvern swoops in.

03:52:59.744 --> 03:53:01.611
SAM: Ah, there's a fucking wyvern?

03:53:01.611 --> 03:53:03.445
LIAM: Keyleth.

03:53:03.445 --> 03:53:06.489
MATT: The one that was left earlier, that was
after you, is going to swoop in and attempt to

03:53:06.489 --> 03:53:13.629
make two strikes at Kima. Miss. And a three. Miss.
And the rider's going to go ahead and make two

03:53:13.629 --> 03:53:21.450
strikes at her as well. Miss with a 17. And a two!
Kima's like deflecting, getting against the wall

03:53:21.450 --> 03:53:26.160
as the spear shoots by and as the blade comes down
from the rider, she strikes it with the sword and

03:53:26.160 --> 03:53:32.358
stops it mid-air, and she starts laughing in his
face. That ends its go.

03:53:32.358 --> 03:53:33.953
TRAVIS: Trinity.

03:53:33.953 --> 03:53:36.309
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

03:53:36.309 --> 03:53:42.558
SAM: Keyleth! There's a wyvern on the field. Or
you can ignore and go into the hole.

03:53:42.558 --> 03:53:49.310
MARISHA: Fuck that wyvern. I say, everyone in the
hole! And I head towards the hole.

03:53:49.310 --> 03:53:51.478
TALIESIN: We're going to need light down here.

03:53:51.478 --> 03:53:53.345
SAM: (singing) Head to the hole!

03:53:53.345 --> 03:53:55.043
MATT: Are you doing a double move?

03:53:55.043 --> 03:53:56.768
MARISHA: (singing) Black as your soul! What?

03:53:56.768 --> 03:53:58.610
MATT: Double move? Are you doing a dash action?

03:53:58.610 --> 03:54:01.918
SAM: You've got nothing else to do.

03:54:01.918 --> 03:54:05.068
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll dash.

03:54:05.068 --> 03:54:16.419
MATT: Okay. So you begin to make it into the hole.
That brings us to Jarett's turn. Jarett is going

03:54:16.419 --> 03:54:23.345
to turn the corner, he's like, "So it's gone?
Okay, good." Loads the crossbow, sees the wyvern,

03:54:23.345 --> 03:54:31.131
and goes, "Are you-- no, are you-- seriously?" and
takes his shots. Nice, 19. Yeah, two shots against

03:54:31.131 --> 03:54:32.416
the wyvern.

03:54:32.416 --> 03:54:36.352
LAURA: Nice. This is his level, this is what
Jarett needs at a time.

03:54:36.352 --> 03:54:37.731
LIAM: This is the Jarett we know.

03:54:37.731 --> 03:54:42.152
MATT: 14 points of damage. He's not the heroic
individual you guys are necessarily.

03:54:42.152 --> 03:54:43.743
MARISHA: Look, he's a great security guard.

03:54:43.743 --> 03:54:48.673
LAURA: He is bad-ass.

03:54:48.673 --> 03:54:51.256
MATT: He is, in his own field.

03:54:51.256 --> 03:54:54.283
LIAM: He caught my sister's attention, anyone that
does that has got to have a lot of spunk.

03:54:54.283 --> 03:54:58.294
MATT: All righty. So that ends his turn there,
those two shots. Both sink into the wyvern, both

03:54:58.294 --> 03:55:07.051
bolt stuns (snarling). That will end his go.
Gilmore, recognizing the circumstance here and

03:55:07.051 --> 03:55:15.452
everyone's rushing in there, he's going to go
ahead and... okay, he'll go, "Actually, me first."

03:55:15.452 --> 03:55:24.879
And he Dimension Doors to the edge, and begins to
charge in after you guys. That brings us to Grog.

03:55:24.879 --> 03:55:27.534
TRAVIS: I want to kill all the things that are
alive.

03:55:27.534 --> 03:55:33.493
MATT: Okay. So you move into melee with the wyvern
and the rider.

03:55:33.493 --> 03:55:42.775
TRAVIS: Yeah. Great Weapon Master, Reckless.
Eight, 15, 19.

03:55:42.775 --> 03:55:44.086
MATT: Hits.

03:55:44.086 --> 03:55:45.998
MARISHA: Kill it real hard.

03:55:45.998 --> 03:55:55.631
TRAVIS: 16. 22. Ooh! 26. 36. For the first hit.

03:55:55.631 --> 03:56:01.109
MATT: We'll say for the sake of brevity, you're
going to wipe out the wyvern.

03:56:01.109 --> 03:56:02.218
TRAVIS: Yay!

03:56:02.218 --> 03:56:04.386
MATT: Because you're giant Grog.

03:56:04.386 --> 03:56:05.801
TRAVIS: Is the lizard man left?

03:56:05.801 --> 03:56:07.194
MATT: The lizard man is left, yes.

03:56:07.194 --> 03:56:08.658
TRAVIS: Can I give him the option to run?

03:56:08.658 --> 03:56:09.763
MATT: If you want to.

03:56:09.763 --> 03:56:11.297
TRAVIS: Nah, fuck that. I kill him, too.

03:56:11.297 --> 03:56:15.503
MATT: Well, all three of your attacks would be
what it would take to take out the wyvern.

03:56:15.503 --> 03:56:16.760
TRAVIS: Hey! Oh, cool.

03:56:16.760 --> 03:56:20.700
MATT: So as you finish cleaving the wyvern down,
it falls over and the lizard man's like (snarls).

03:56:20.700 --> 03:56:23.713
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do this.

03:56:23.713 --> 03:56:29.574
MATT: (reptilian whimper) It looks conflicted.

03:56:29.574 --> 03:56:34.146
TRAVIS: You're at a crossroads, bro. Crossroads.

03:56:34.146 --> 03:56:39.056
MATT: Vex. It's your go.

03:56:39.056 --> 03:56:40.503
LAURA: Okay.

03:56:40.503 --> 03:56:46.709
MATT: You have Raishan like (booming footsteps)
stepping over to Thordak's body, watching you

03:56:46.709 --> 03:56:47.992
closely.

03:56:47.992 --> 03:56:49.798
LAURA: What are you doing?

03:56:49.798 --> 03:56:54.400
MATT: "Exactly what we talked about. Learning his
secret."

03:56:54.400 --> 03:57:04.856
LAURA: I'm going to keep my hand ready to attack
and hold my action until anything gets aggressive

03:57:04.856 --> 03:57:06.464
with Raishan.

03:57:06.464 --> 03:57:07.763
MATT: Okay.

03:57:07.763 --> 03:57:11.968
TALIESIN: What do you see down there? What's
happening, what's in the room?

03:57:11.968 --> 03:57:13.903
LAURA: Thordak is dead.

03:57:13.903 --> 03:57:15.344
TALIESIN: What's in the room?

03:57:15.344 --> 03:57:17.192
LAURA: Oh, what do I see around me?

03:57:17.192 --> 03:57:22.992
MATT: The tunnel that you're in, it's been a
steady decline. It's rounded off a little bit and

03:57:22.992 --> 03:57:29.524
it begins to open up maybe 70 feet ahead of you.
Actually, with your darkvision, you would just

03:57:29.524 --> 03:57:34.149
barely start to see it begin to open, it looks
like there's an actual chamber ahead of all of you

03:57:34.149 --> 03:57:35.933
guys, but you haven't reached it yet.

03:57:35.933 --> 03:57:38.889
TRAVIS: The shitter.

03:57:38.889 --> 03:57:50.795
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to use my movement to back
away from Raishan towards the chamber. But I'm

03:57:50.795 --> 03:57:54.896
going to hold my attack until I think it's
aggressive.

03:57:54.896 --> 03:58:00.446
MATT: Okay. So as you move in, you can see there's
a very, very faint glow of orange and red in the

03:58:00.446 --> 03:58:10.513
room, and the whole tunnel here has a very, very,
very concentrated natural burning chemical smell

03:58:10.513 --> 03:58:24.404
to it. A lot of sulfur-type, very putrid, pungent
smells. And the glow you can now see, there is a

03:58:24.404 --> 03:58:30.119
lava flow that is coalescing in the center of this
room, or at least is pouring through, and it looks

03:58:30.119 --> 03:58:35.953
like it's bisecting this room. You don't make out
much more detail than that at this distance, but

03:58:35.953 --> 03:58:39.511
you do see this chamber does have an actual flow
of liquid rock.

03:58:39.511 --> 03:58:41.019
LAURA: Okay.

03:58:41.019 --> 03:58:42.769
MATT: Vax.

03:58:42.769 --> 03:58:44.706
LIAM: Keyleth? You tell me.

03:58:44.706 --> 03:58:52.272
MARISHA: What's going on? Whatcha doing?

03:58:52.272 --> 03:58:53.875
LIAM: You tell me.

03:58:53.875 --> 03:58:57.468
MARISHA: Just describe the scene.

03:58:57.468 --> 03:58:59.051
LIAM: Hit or wait?

03:58:59.051 --> 03:59:02.016
MARISHA: Wait till I'm there! Wait till I'm
there!

03:59:02.016 --> 03:59:03.211
LIAM: What?

03:59:03.211 --> 03:59:04.889
MARISHA: Wait till I'm there!

03:59:04.889 --> 03:59:08.254
LIAM: I'm going to hold my turn until Keyleth
acts.

03:59:08.254 --> 03:59:14.420
MATT: Okay. Pike, Scanlan, you guys all follow
suit?

03:59:14.420 --> 03:59:15.543
SAM: Yeah.

03:59:15.543 --> 03:59:20.754
MATT: Okay, at a full run you guys can get, at
your tiny feet you can get up towards the edge

03:59:20.754 --> 03:59:21.761
there.

03:59:21.761 --> 03:59:25.022
TALIESIN: I'm at a full run on the roof.

03:59:25.022 --> 03:59:34.307
MATT: Right, Percival. Yeah, you do, you get up
there and inside. Raishan comes up to the body of

03:59:34.307 --> 03:59:44.946
Thordak and you see that she reaches up under one
of her scales and pulls out a small leather case.

03:59:44.946 --> 03:59:46.802
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

03:59:46.802 --> 03:59:48.542
MATT: Pops open the case.

03:59:48.542 --> 03:59:50.782
MARISHA: Don't let her touch him.

03:59:50.782 --> 03:59:59.160
MATT: And sits back and pulls open a somewhat
weathered scroll. And starts reading off of it.

03:59:59.160 --> 04:00:02.257
(magical language)

04:00:02.257 --> 04:00:03.988
LAURA: Oh, no, what is this?

04:00:03.988 --> 04:00:06.395
MARISHA: No no no! Don't go, don't go--

04:00:06.395 --> 04:00:10.855
LIAM: Attack. I'm attacking her. She acted, she
said don't touch, I said I'll base it off of

04:00:10.855 --> 04:00:13.675
Keyleth, so I'm attacking. I'm going to interrupt
that.

04:00:13.675 --> 04:00:16.499
TRAVIS: Don't you want to see what happens?

04:00:16.499 --> 04:00:17.863
LIAM: No.

04:00:17.863 --> 04:00:21.975
MATT: Okay. Hold on. You say attack based on--
Because you don't see this yet.

04:00:21.975 --> 04:00:25.494
MARISHA: I said don't let her touch him.

04:00:25.494 --> 04:00:27.250
TRAVIS: She's reading that scroll, man.

04:00:27.250 --> 04:00:29.735
MATT: She hasn't touched him yet. But you're
attacking on your own instinct.

04:00:29.735 --> 04:00:33.713
LIAM: If I've heard don't let her touch him, and
she's doing that, those two things mean the same

04:00:33.713 --> 04:00:36.949
thing to me. She's doing something. Yes.

04:00:36.949 --> 04:00:41.012
MATT: All right. I will say, for this, go ahead
and make a dexterity check.

04:00:41.012 --> 04:00:47.627
LIAM: Dexterity check? All right. And I'll use my
last Luck of the day.

04:00:47.627 --> 04:00:49.628
SAM: I thought you did that already.

04:00:49.628 --> 04:00:52.867
LIAM: I had two. So that's a 28.

04:00:52.867 --> 04:00:59.286
MATT: 28, okay. So you can make your attack. This
with the dagger?

04:00:59.286 --> 04:01:02.242
LIAM: This is everything. How far away is she from
me?

04:01:02.242 --> 04:01:04.756
MATT: She's maybe like 20 feet, so you can--

04:01:04.756 --> 04:01:06.110
LIAM: All three attacks.

04:01:06.110 --> 04:01:09.177
MATT: Well, you held your action, which means you
can only take your action, you can't move as well.

04:01:09.177 --> 04:01:12.216
LIAM: Okay. Move? I don't need to move. How far
away is she, you said--

04:01:12.216 --> 04:01:13.193
MATT: 20 feet.

04:01:13.193 --> 04:01:15.444
LIAM: 20 feet. So I can throw daggers at her,
right?

04:01:15.444 --> 04:01:17.064
LAURA: Yeah, but you can't throw your sword

04:01:17.064 --> 04:01:22.488
LIAM: No, but I have lots of daggers. I still have
the Flametongue Dagger, which is not attuned, it's

04:01:22.488 --> 04:01:23.760
just a lame old dagger.

04:01:23.760 --> 04:01:25.761
MATT: That's true, you can do that, yeah. So yeah,
you can do that.

04:01:25.761 --> 04:01:27.491
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

04:01:27.491 --> 04:01:31.096
LIAM: First one is a 23.

04:01:31.096 --> 04:01:32.726
MATT: A 23?

04:01:32.726 --> 04:01:36.072
LIAM: Second one is a 19.

04:01:36.072 --> 04:01:40.764
Third one is a 29.

04:01:40.764 --> 04:01:47.160
MATT: Okay. So it was-- 29 hits. The first one...

04:01:47.160 --> 04:01:50.011
LIAM: God. I don't remember.

04:01:50.011 --> 04:01:51.353
LAURA: A 23.

04:01:51.353 --> 04:01:52.999
LIAM: 23 sounds familiar.

04:01:52.999 --> 04:01:57.719
MATT: Right. The 19 was the one that didn't hit.

04:01:57.719 --> 04:02:02.318
LIAM: So two of the three hit? So it was
hit-miss-hit, right? I think so. All right, so the

04:02:02.318 --> 04:02:13.807
first one is Whisper. Four plus eight is 12, plus
psychic damage is 15, but there's no sneak attack,

04:02:13.807 --> 04:02:18.671
because there's nobody near her, and the Hunter's
Mark-- Oh! Can I move Hunter's Mark to her at this

04:02:18.671 --> 04:02:20.383
point? I have no idea.

04:02:20.383 --> 04:02:22.348
MATT: No, because you've used all your attacks.

04:02:22.348 --> 04:02:28.211
LIAM: It's a bonus? Okay. Got it. Okay. So 15 for
the first and the second one. Oh, I don't need

04:02:28.211 --> 04:02:32.869
that. Is nine.

04:02:32.869 --> 04:02:35.158
MATT: Okay, so what was the first attack? It
was--

04:02:35.158 --> 04:02:36.631
LIAM: 15 plus nine.

04:02:36.631 --> 04:02:42.943
MATT: 15? 15 plus nine. So the first attack was
15. Okay, maintains concentration. Maintains

04:02:42.943 --> 04:02:44.008
concentration.

04:02:44.008 --> 04:02:46.902
LIAM: And I'll use my movement to move between my
sister and Raishan.

04:02:46.902 --> 04:02:48.847
LAURA: You can't do movement, because you were
holding your action.

04:02:48.847 --> 04:02:50.107
LIAM: Okay.

04:02:50.107 --> 04:02:57.241
MATT: Okay. So as both daggers come, you watch as
it's muttering from the scroll, not both of her

04:02:57.241 --> 04:03:02.026
eyes, but one of the eyes turns to face you.

04:03:02.026 --> 04:03:03.501
LAURA: Like a chameleon.

04:03:03.501 --> 04:03:12.682
MATT: Yeah. And narrows. The scroll finishes and
(poof) turns to ash. And similar to something

04:03:12.682 --> 04:03:21.002
you've seen before, you watch as Thordak's corpse,
which is currently buried into the rock with the

04:03:21.002 --> 04:03:33.058
face to the side, the breath filters into the
mouth. The body still motionless, you recognize

04:03:33.058 --> 04:03:36.668
this similar or adjacent magic to the Speak With
Dead--

04:03:36.668 --> 04:03:38.014
LIAM: We've seen Pike do it.

04:03:38.014 --> 04:03:39.299
MATT: Yes.

04:03:39.299 --> 04:03:43.563
SAM: She's just trying to ask a question, Vax. I
mean, Jesus.

04:03:43.563 --> 04:03:46.947
LIAM: You're not here.

04:03:46.947 --> 04:03:55.947
MATT: So as soon as that finishes, Raishan-- the
other eye flickers over. Now both eyes are on you.

04:03:55.947 --> 04:04:01.254
And says, "Know what you're doing."

04:04:01.254 --> 04:04:13.685
LIAM: You're not walking away from this field.
You're going to die. Maybe I will too, but you are

04:04:13.685 --> 04:04:15.951
going to die.

04:04:15.951 --> 04:04:24.997
MATT: (chuckles) Okay.

04:04:24.997 --> 04:04:34.003
SAM: We're men of our word. We're men of honor.

04:04:34.003 --> 04:04:38.907
MATT: Raishan is going to...

04:04:38.907 --> 04:04:41.300
LAURA: She did attack our home.

04:04:41.300 --> 04:04:44.322
SAM: I'm not saying she's great.

04:04:44.322 --> 04:04:53.001
MATT: Hmm. Let me check one thing real fast.

04:04:53.001 --> 04:04:57.203
SAM: Hmm. Oh boy. You stumped the chump.

04:04:57.203 --> 04:05:02.431
MATT: Well, I'm trying to see what her reaction's
going to be. Oh, okay. She feels comfortable with

04:05:02.431 --> 04:05:15.757
that. She goes, "Well, then. Come claim me!" And
just steps away from Thordak. And with one big

04:05:15.757 --> 04:05:20.412
push of the wings, turns around and coasts into
the chamber beyond you.

04:05:20.412 --> 04:05:22.051
LIAM: Out of sight?

04:05:22.051 --> 04:05:26.901
MATT: Beyond, you can see her form disappear into
the darkness. There's a little bit of an orange

04:05:26.901 --> 04:05:34.656
glow in there, but given that circumstance, yeah,
she disappears into the shadows of the room.

04:05:34.656 --> 04:05:37.388
LAURA: Should I have taken my shots when things
got aggressive?

04:05:37.388 --> 04:05:38.888
MARISHA: So she's coming towards us.

04:05:38.888 --> 04:05:40.448
MATT: No, she's going the opposite direction.

04:05:40.448 --> 04:05:47.408
LAURA: I mean, did that look aggressive?

04:05:47.408 --> 04:05:53.366
MATT: She flew away from your brother. But your
brother did throw three daggers into her, and then

04:05:53.366 --> 04:05:55.512
said she was going to die.

04:05:55.512 --> 04:05:57.495
TRAVIS: Did she ask her questions of Thordak?

04:05:57.495 --> 04:06:02.351
LAURA: It might not have been the same fucking
spell. It could have been something like it.

04:06:02.351 --> 04:06:03.896
TRAVIS: He said it looked very similar.

04:06:03.896 --> 04:06:05.252
LAURA: Yeah, adjacent.

04:06:05.252 --> 04:06:08.822
LIAM: I'm sure she was just going to ask about
cooking recipes. It's fine.

04:06:08.822 --> 04:06:13.761
MATT: So what are you going to do, attack or not?
You watched your brother throw three daggers into

04:06:13.761 --> 04:06:20.939
Raishan, and tell her that she's going to die, and
then Raishan basically abandoned Thordak's body

04:06:20.939 --> 04:06:22.397
and fled.

04:06:22.397 --> 04:06:24.261
LAURA: Said, "Come and claim me," and flew toward
me?

04:06:24.261 --> 04:06:28.694
MATT: Flew over you, and past, into the chamber.

04:06:28.694 --> 04:06:31.936
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to attack.

04:06:31.936 --> 04:06:34.943
MATT: Go for it. Roll your attacks!

04:06:34.943 --> 04:06:39.352
LAURA: Oh no.

04:06:39.352 --> 04:06:41.606
TRAVIS: Do it, Tiny Toon!

04:06:41.606 --> 04:06:43.062
LIAM: Go for it.

04:06:43.062 --> 04:06:44.447
SAM: You got this, Bailes.

04:06:44.447 --> 04:06:48.237
MARISHA: I mean, she kind of released Thordak.
She's totally Little Finger.

04:06:48.237 --> 04:06:49.799
LAURA: This isn't about vengeance, though, you
guys.

04:06:49.799 --> 04:06:51.441
SAM: What is it about?

04:06:51.441 --> 04:06:57.718
MATT: Roll your attacks.

04:06:57.718 --> 04:07:01.189
LIAM: Five, four, three, two...

04:07:01.189 --> 04:07:07.088
LAURA: I don't know. (sad noise) That one doesn't
hit. Probably. 18.

04:07:07.088 --> 04:07:08.450
MATT: Nope.

04:07:08.450 --> 04:07:11.599
LAURA: That one probably hits. 27?

04:07:11.599 --> 04:07:12.811
MATT: Yeah.

04:07:12.811 --> 04:07:14.491
(laughter)

04:07:14.491 --> 04:07:16.909
SAM: Saddest attack ever.

04:07:16.909 --> 04:07:20.544
LAURA: And a natural fucking one. Fenthras can
sense my trepidation.

04:07:20.544 --> 04:07:26.086
MATT: Hah, apparently! So roll damage on one arrow
strike. And it is, your hand's shaking at this

04:07:26.086 --> 04:07:31.405
moment, you're trying to figure out what to do. When
she flies overhead, you release one arrow, pull

04:07:31.405 --> 04:07:35.495
back and pull another, and the second one is right
as she's over and above, sinks in. And the third one,

04:07:35.495 --> 04:07:37.544
you fire after, and it hits the rock ceiling.

04:07:37.544 --> 04:07:39.157
LAURA: Just 15 damage.

04:07:39.157 --> 04:07:51.675
MATT: 15 points of damage. All righty. Raishan
just swoops into the darkness of the chamber

04:07:51.675 --> 04:08:00.250
beyond. Keyleth. You just manage to catch up at
this point now, at a full run, this will be your

04:08:00.250 --> 04:08:08.541
full turn, catching up to Vex and Vax. Or Vax
specifically, Vex is a little beyond, aggressive

04:08:08.541 --> 04:08:12.428
stance, Raishan nowhere to be seen, Thordak's
corpse ground into the dirt.

04:08:12.428 --> 04:08:14.525
MARISHA: Where is she?

04:08:14.525 --> 04:08:16.044
LIAM: Forward.

04:08:16.044 --> 04:08:20.307
MARISHA: Are we going after her? I mean--

04:08:20.307 --> 04:08:21.793
TALIESIN: I'm not there.

04:08:21.793 --> 04:08:23.779
LIAM: Yes.

04:08:23.779 --> 04:08:26.306
MARISHA: I run deeper into the hole.

04:08:26.306 --> 04:08:33.161
MATT: Okay. Jarett and Gilmore, at this point,
manage to catch up to you guys, as well. It'll

04:08:33.161 --> 04:08:39.283
take a while for Grog and Kima to catch up to you
guys.

04:08:39.283 --> 04:08:41.311
TRAVIS: Oh, I didn't say I was leaving.

04:08:41.311 --> 04:08:43.436
SAM: Looting the giant's body?

04:08:43.436 --> 04:08:44.988
TRAVIS: No, there's a lizardfolk right there.

04:08:44.988 --> 04:08:46.269
MATT: It's true, actually, yeah.

04:08:46.269 --> 04:08:49.075
TRAVIS: I want to see how many licks it takes to
get to the center of a Tootsie Roll Pop.

04:08:49.075 --> 04:08:51.863
SAM: One. It takes one lick.

04:08:51.863 --> 04:08:54.904
MATT: Well, Grog, it's staring at you, going like
(growl).

04:08:54.904 --> 04:08:56.434
TRAVIS: I reach out and go like (head crushing
sound).

04:08:56.434 --> 04:08:59.795
MATT: Make a strength check.

04:08:59.795 --> 04:09:01.858
TRAVIS: I have advantage on those.

04:09:01.858 --> 04:09:03.948
(laughter)

04:09:03.948 --> 04:09:09.523
TRAVIS: 18. 18 plus seven. 25.

04:09:09.523 --> 04:09:19.004
MATT: 25? There's this moment where you're
grabbing its head, and it reaches up and (frantic snarl).

04:09:19.004 --> 04:09:22.995
TRAVIS: Can't hear you, can't hear you.

04:09:22.995 --> 04:09:24.540
(laughter)

04:09:24.540 --> 04:09:31.598
MATT: A very Riki-oh type moment. The head just
pops outward in a smear of purple gore.

04:09:31.598 --> 04:09:40.576
TRAVIS: Oh, no. That's the show, folks. All right.
Well. Anybody see that? Who's here?

04:09:40.576 --> 04:09:42.085
SAM: My hand is near you.

04:09:42.085 --> 04:09:43.529
TRAVIS: Kima's there, right?

04:09:43.529 --> 04:09:48.385
MATT: (chuckles) Bigby's Hand claps the wall,
applause.

04:09:48.385 --> 04:09:50.603
(laughter)

04:09:50.603 --> 04:09:52.521
TRAVIS: Ha, fuck Bigby's Hand.

04:09:52.521 --> 04:09:59.460
MATT: You look over at Kima, and Kima's kind of
spattered with it, and she goes, "Well done!"

04:09:59.460 --> 04:10:01.903
TRAVIS: Smooth, right? Let's join everybody
else.

04:10:01.913 --> 04:10:09.494
MATT: "All right, all right." You're going your
movement, about there, full speed. Kima's a little

04:10:09.494 --> 04:10:18.725
slower behind. She'll catch up at a full
double-dash speed, there. Jarett and everybody

04:10:18.725 --> 04:10:20.644
else has kind of moved in. We'll say at this
point, the rest of you--

04:10:20.644 --> 04:10:22.331
LAURA: (laughs) Jarett is just like--

04:10:22.331 --> 04:10:23.787
MATT: He can't do anything, he's having a bad day,
man.

04:10:23.787 --> 04:10:27.997
MARISHA: Poor Jarett.

04:10:27.997 --> 04:10:31.670
MATT: So you guys all charge in after?

04:10:31.670 --> 04:10:35.174
TALIESIN: I'm doing the best I can, I can't see a
damn thing.

04:10:35.174 --> 04:10:37.808
MATT: No, you guys are far behind. So it's
currently you three in the lead.

04:10:37.808 --> 04:10:44.779
TRAVIS: Should anybody stay out here in case she
wants to come back out? You want me to stay out?

04:10:44.779 --> 04:10:47.722
MATT: Do you want to move Bigby's Hand?

04:10:47.722 --> 04:10:53.995
SAM: Yeah, for the rest of the one minute 
it works for. Which is not very long?

04:10:53.995 --> 04:10:55.040
MATT: Nah.

04:10:55.040 --> 04:10:59.331
TALIESIN: If she makes her way out, that means
we're all dead. Come on in. It'll be fun. Let's

04:10:59.331 --> 04:11:02.006
all die together.

04:11:02.006 --> 04:11:04.932
MARISHA: We'll go to the spa afterwards.

04:11:04.932 --> 04:11:14.027
MATT: So you guys kind of rush into this chamber
now, and the heat in here is more immense than

04:11:14.027 --> 04:11:21.478
anything you felt on the surface. This is kind of
the core of the volcanic surge that Thordak's

04:11:21.478 --> 04:11:27.024
presence was pulling upward. You see within,
there's this flow of lava. I want the three of you

04:11:27.024 --> 04:11:29.389
to roll perception checks, if you can.

04:11:29.389 --> 04:11:33.728
SAM: Who's the three, Vax, Vex, and--

04:11:33.728 --> 04:11:37.014
LIAM: 31. 31.

04:11:37.014 --> 04:11:40.068
LAURA: This is at advantage because it's a
dragon-related thing?

04:11:40.068 --> 04:11:46.047
MATT: Well, are you looking for Raishan, or are
you inspecting the room for details?

04:11:46.047 --> 04:11:48.181
LAURA: I don't know, what am I rolling for?

04:11:48.181 --> 04:11:51.304
MATT: I was rolling to see just the general
vicinity of the room.

04:11:51.304 --> 04:11:52.836
LAURA: Okay, 27.

04:11:52.836 --> 04:11:54.629
LIAM: 31.

04:11:54.629 --> 04:11:55.741
MARISHA: 25.

04:11:55.741 --> 04:12:04.835
MATT: You guys, the first thing you notice as you
glance around, is there are some kind of alcoves

04:12:04.835 --> 04:12:14.766
inside this chamber where the rock formations pull
inward. You see kind of set into the stone and

04:12:14.766 --> 04:12:23.110
various bits of fallen rock and earth, a handful,
somewhat spread out throughout the room, a handful

04:12:23.110 --> 04:12:34.145
of large nine-foot-tall dark, deep crimson red
with crystalline elements to the outside, ovoid

04:12:34.145 --> 04:12:53.190
structures. These are what appear to be larger
than normal, elementally altered dragon eggs. Five

04:12:53.190 --> 04:12:55.187
of them in the chamber.

04:12:55.187 --> 04:12:57.222
LAURA: Five bebes?!

04:12:57.222 --> 04:13:02.446
SAM: (singing) Muppet Babies...

04:13:02.446 --> 04:13:14.474
LAURA: Can I look back at Thordak? What does it
look like-- I know Raishan, like, (gasps) made him

04:13:14.474 --> 04:13:17.825
do that. Does it look like there's anything around
him, or is he just dead-dead still?

04:13:17.825 --> 04:13:24.229
MATT: He's a ways back. If you want to try and
move back to him, you can. But, with your high

04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:30.438
perception, you glance up and see in the ceiling
portion of this chamber where there are a number

04:13:30.438 --> 04:13:35.984
of these small caverns that are pressed up to the
side, you see out of the top just the slight

04:13:35.984 --> 04:13:44.840
peeking of Raishan's face, kind of looking down
into the chamber above you. And you watch as the

04:13:44.840 --> 04:13:51.615
teeth, something muttering in the mouth, the teeth
grin as the ceiling of the room, you watch

04:13:51.615 --> 04:13:58.993
distortion in the air above you. Almost like these
small portals kind of (multiple fwooshes) open,

04:13:58.993 --> 04:14:13.030
and coming flying out of them, you see four large,
flaming rocks. Rocks. These are massive, fiery,

04:14:13.030 --> 04:14:20.023
meteorite-like boulders, that come firing out of
the ceiling of the room (crashing sounds).

04:14:20.023 --> 04:14:25.027
Slamming into the ground around you, exploding in
a massive explosions, rocking you. All you see is

04:14:25.027 --> 04:14:29.833
white, and ringing in your ears as your bodies are
thrown from explosion to explosion. I need the

04:14:29.833 --> 04:14:32.284
three of you to make dexterity saving throws.

04:14:32.284 --> 04:14:39.521
LIAM: 25.

04:14:39.521 --> 04:14:44.284
MARISHA: I rolled a natural 19, so 22.

04:14:44.284 --> 04:14:47.450
LAURA: 29.

04:14:47.450 --> 04:14:51.163
SAM: Wow, guys! That's really good rolling!

04:14:51.163 --> 04:15:01.288
MATT: You guys take half damage. Well, here, let's
do the first part. So, there's the fire damage.

04:15:01.288 --> 04:15:03.847
Which is 20d6.

04:15:03.847 --> 04:15:05.315
LIAM: What did we have to beat?

04:15:05.315 --> 04:15:08.697
MATT: You had to beat 22.

04:15:08.697 --> 04:15:11.083
LIAM: Zero.

04:15:11.083 --> 04:15:18.942
MATT: Right, so you take zero damage from this.
Both of you take 63 points of fire damage. Halved,

04:15:18.942 --> 04:15:25.885
to 31. And then you each take 70 points of
bludgeoning damage.

04:15:25.885 --> 04:15:29.827
MARISHA: 70?

04:15:29.827 --> 04:15:32.187
TRAVIS: That's 130-something total points.

04:15:32.187 --> 04:15:42.366
MATT: As these flaming arcane meteors crash into
the ground, detonating and destroying a portion of

04:15:42.366 --> 04:15:50.739
the cavern floor, lava spatters everywhere, and
you watch as you duck out of the way as, Keyleth,

04:15:50.739 --> 04:15:52.536
what are your hit points at?

04:15:52.536 --> 04:16:00.250
MARISHA: I'm actually still up at-- What's 101
minus 119? 18 points.

04:16:00.250 --> 04:16:06.238
MATT: 18 points. Set your hit points to that. You
watch as your sister is thrown, her body

04:16:06.238 --> 04:16:13.080
unconscious, flung in the air like a ragdoll as it
scatters to one end of the cavern. You can see the

04:16:13.080 --> 04:16:18.351
volcanic activity billowing up from the recent
shaking of the room, as bits of the molten rock

04:16:18.351 --> 04:16:27.395
are flung across, as the green dragon face kind of
withdraws in the cave. And I think that's where

04:16:27.395 --> 04:16:28.946
we're going to pick up next year.

04:16:28.946 --> 04:16:30.951
(yelling)

04:16:30.951 --> 04:16:33.188
MATT: It's 11:22, guys! We gotta get home!

04:16:33.188 --> 04:16:36.088
SAM: Next year?! We have to wait a year?!

04:16:36.088 --> 04:16:40.217
LAURA: I have to find out if I'm for sure dead.

04:16:40.217 --> 04:16:42.201
LIAM: I got you, I got you.

04:16:42.201 --> 04:16:43.951
LAURA: I'm across the fucking room.

04:16:43.951 --> 04:16:47.808
LIAM: Doesn't matter, I can fly 500 feet, I got
you.

04:16:47.808 --> 04:16:50.976
TALIESIN: You're going to get the conclusion of
this before the next season of Westworld.

04:16:50.976 --> 04:16:52.746
LIAM: Lay on Hands, dude.

04:16:52.746 --> 04:16:55.856
SAM: No, she's dead.

04:16:55.856 --> 04:16:58.451
LIAM: No, shut up. I will kill you in the parking
lot.

04:16:58.451 --> 04:17:00.757
MATT: We will pick this up in January.

04:17:00.757 --> 04:17:05.315
TRAVIS: What was that called, those four flaming
rocks?

04:17:05.315 --> 04:17:07.959
MATT: That's called Meteor Swarm. That's a
9th-level spell.

04:17:07.959 --> 04:17:12.525
TRAVIS: Is that a spell? What level is that?

04:17:12.525 --> 04:17:14.048
ALL: 9th-level.

04:17:14.048 --> 04:17:18.697
LIAM: She just blew her wad, she's done, we got a
dragon and a flute.

04:17:18.697 --> 04:17:20.134
LAURA: She's not done.

04:17:20.134 --> 04:17:26.182
MATT: You're right. She has nothing else up her
sleeve. So. On that note.

04:17:26.182 --> 04:17:27.884
SAM: Matt Mercer.

04:17:27.884 --> 04:17:33.716
MATT: This could possibly be a whole different
encounter, I don't want to keep you guys here

04:17:33.716 --> 04:17:36.727
until 1 AM. I know Laura has to record in the
morning.

04:17:36.727 --> 04:17:39.144
LAURA: I do, I have to film all day.

04:17:39.144 --> 04:17:41.504

04:17:41.504 --> 04:17:49.186
MATT: Well. Guys. This will be interesting.

04:17:49.186 --> 04:17:51.095
(groaning)

04:17:51.095 --> 04:17:54.001
MATT: Yeah, it's going to take a few rounds for
the rest of the party to get here.

04:17:54.001 --> 04:17:55.594
TRAVIS: She didn't get to ask any of the
questions?

04:17:55.594 --> 04:17:58.511
LAURA: She might not have even needed to ask
questions.

04:17:58.511 --> 04:18:01.539
SAM: Of course she did, she cast a big spell to do
it!

04:18:01.539 --> 04:18:03.504
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe she was doing it
telepathically.

04:18:03.504 --> 04:18:05.452
SAM: What are you talking about? She read a
scroll!

04:18:05.452 --> 04:18:09.199
LAURA: Maybe it was just taking his soul into
herself.

04:18:09.199 --> 04:18:10.872
SAM: Information!

04:18:10.872 --> 04:18:17.546
MATT: Regardless. (laugh) We are out for the
evening, thank you all for sticking with us for

04:18:17.546 --> 04:18:19.256
this longer episode.

04:18:19.256 --> 04:18:24.096
LIAM: We should have just let her do what she
wants, summon the most powerful thing in the

04:18:24.096 --> 04:18:25.060
universe.

04:18:25.060 --> 04:18:26.226
TRAVIS: I like that idea.

04:18:26.226 --> 04:18:29.049
MARISHA: Team Rowdy Half-Elves, what's up!

04:18:29.049 --> 04:18:33.041
MATT: Yeah, the half-elves are down here in this
chamber, with the Thordak eggs.

04:18:33.041 --> 04:18:37.187
MARISHA: Half-elves, running in, recklessly, yeah!
Like we do!

04:18:37.187 --> 04:18:41.608
TALIESIN: I've got nothin'. Yeah.

04:18:41.608 --> 04:18:45.794
MATT: (laughs) Anyway, guys. Thank you so much for
watching, thank you guys for kicking ass in that

04:18:45.794 --> 04:18:46.880
battle.

04:18:46.880 --> 04:18:48.705

New Year to all of you guys, very happy holidays

04:19:06.473 --> 04:19:12.281
