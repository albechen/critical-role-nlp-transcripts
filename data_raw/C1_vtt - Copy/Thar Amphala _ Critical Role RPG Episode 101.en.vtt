00:00:00.067 --> 00:00:03.247
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.247 --> 00:00:08.385
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons at the same table. Thank you

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:12.918
so much for your patience. As mentioned last week,
we're adjusting and changing and updating things

00:00:12.918 --> 00:00:17.621
and taking your feedback and our feedback, and
everyone's been working really hard to make this

00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:20.857
set progressively better and better to make it a
better experience. This is our first time all at

00:00:20.857 --> 00:00:23.670
the same table since the home game.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.083
(cheering)

00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:32.203
MATT: But no, seriously, don't do that. That's
okay.

00:00:32.203 --> 00:00:34.069
MARISHA: Still in front of a green screen.

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:37.749
MATT: Still in front of a green screen. Totally.
Thank you guys so much for being patient. We are

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:42.562
up now, and let's dive into the announcements for
the evening. We don't have a whole lot this week,

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:46.805
but we have, let's see. Any updates as far as the
merch is concerned?

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:51.686
LAURA: The merchandises? Well, you know, we do
have that amazing David Mack poster.

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:56.578
SAM: But I thought that was only a limited-release
item, Laura.

00:00:56.578 --> 00:01:01.832
LAURA: It is, actually, but it's available for
three more weeks. The signed version is available

00:01:01.832 --> 00:01:08.068
for two more weeks. And since it is a limited-time
release thing, if you know anybody that watches

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:12.894
the show but is maybe way behind and they're not
watching live, it would probably be nice to let

00:01:12.894 --> 00:01:17.501
them know about it, because I still get some
messages about the Joe Mad poster that people

00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:23.153
can't get anymore. So it will be gone after this,
so it's nice if they can get it, too. And we have

00:01:23.153 --> 00:01:27.482
the Scanlan tee, and we have our amazing Slayer's
Take aprons. Slayer's Cake aprons.

00:01:27.482 --> 00:01:29.988
SAM: Let's talk about the Scanlan t-shirt a little
more.

00:01:29.988 --> 00:01:32.822
LAURA: We have the amazing Scanlan concert tee.

00:01:32.822 --> 00:01:35.959
TRAVIS: That asshole? No, we're good.

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:39.450
LAURA: And, you know, a bunch of other t-shirts as
well, and a whole bunch of other things. Go check

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.117
out the shop on geekandsundry.com and you'll see
all of the merchandise that's available.

00:01:44.117 --> 00:01:58.097
MATT: All right, cool. Also, a reminder, guys, the
Tal'Dorei campaign guide's coming out at GenCon in

00:01:58.097 --> 00:02:03.691
August. Pre-orders go up, I believe, mid-July, and
I think if you pre-order it, I think it's like

00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:07.400
five extra bucks or something like that, you get
the PDF download immediately. All the information

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.036
is on Green Ronin's website, so go check it out if
you have any questions there, because they can

00:02:12.036 --> 00:02:17.311
answer them better than I can. I'm steeped in art
approvals and everything right now.

00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:20.221
MARISHA: The art is looking so good!

00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:25.472
MATT: It's looking awesome. We've pulled in some--
we've got a lot of community artists that we

00:02:25.472 --> 00:02:29.349
pushed over towards Green Ronin, so they've been
pulling people from the community, which makes me

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.250
happy, because I want to get as many of you guys
involved as possible in this.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.448
LAURA: As many of us as possible?

00:02:34.448 --> 00:02:36.067
LIAM: I can't draw for shit.

00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:37.358
SAM: I can do some art.

00:02:37.358 --> 00:02:39.170
MATT: I was referring to the community, not you
guys.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.807
TRAVIS: Sam's art is really rare.

00:02:40.807 --> 00:02:47.027
MATT: Yeah, I've seen it, and it's pretty... yeah.
They all wind up looking like genitals. It's

00:02:47.027 --> 00:02:49.934
crazy. We have the podcast, which is now up.

00:02:49.934 --> 00:02:52.010
(cheering)

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.160
MATT: Audio podcast, for people who want to save
their data and listen on long drives.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.139
LAURA: Who don't want to look at our faces.

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:58.723
MATT: I don't blame you.

00:02:58.723 --> 00:03:01.761
TRAVIS: For no other reason than for those Sam
Riegel advertisements at the beginning.

00:03:01.761 --> 00:03:11.343
MATT: So we got that. And we have Wednesday Club.

00:03:11.343 --> 00:03:14.791
TALIESIN: Yeah, Wednesday Club next week. I don't
actually know what we're doing, because I haven't

00:03:14.791 --> 00:03:19.741
looked at the 30-plus messages in that text
thread, because I've been working on a thing that

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:22.521
I can't talk about yet that's going to be really,
really great.

00:03:22.521 --> 00:03:29.017
SAM: Taliesin, I feel like most of the time you
don't know what you're going to be talking about.

00:03:29.017 --> 00:03:30.299
TALIESIN: That's true.

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.504
SAM: So maybe you should just have a go-to. Like,
it's going to be Daredevil again. Or something.

00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:34.631
Just something.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:39.204
TALIESIN: What are we going to-- yeah, we need a
go-to. What was going to be our blanket go-to?

00:03:39.204 --> 00:03:40.450
I'm not sure.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.363
TRAVIS: Punisher.

00:03:41.363 --> 00:03:42.660
MARISHA: Great Lakes Avengers

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.169
TALIESIN: Great Lakes Avengers is actually pretty
spectacular. It's hard to say it.

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:46.475
Great Lakes Avengers.

00:03:46.475 --> 00:03:49.588
MATT: Make a big effort to bring back the What
the--?! comics.

00:03:49.588 --> 00:03:53.114
LIAM: What about the scientology graphic novels?

00:03:53.114 --> 00:03:55.251
TALIESIN: I haven't read those. Do they have
those?

00:03:55.251 --> 00:03:56.868
LIAM: Well, I'm up to level six.

00:03:56.868 --> 00:03:58.725
(laughter)

00:03:58.725 --> 00:04:01.065
TALIESIN: Do you want to be a guest on the show?

00:04:01.065 --> 00:04:07.001
MATT: You've almost learned invisibility! Anyway.
Apologies to all our scientology fans.

00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:08.871
SAM: Yeah, we just lost half the audience.

00:04:08.871 --> 00:04:12.813
MATT: All right, so.

00:04:12.813 --> 00:04:16.978
LIAM: Sea Org uniforms, watching a giant-screen TV
of Critical Role.

00:04:16.978 --> 00:04:22.090
(laughter)

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.228
MATT: Exactly. And Signal Boost?

00:04:25.228 --> 00:04:30.034
MARISHA: Jeff Lewis. We announced it on Tuesday on
Talks. Yeah, Jeff Lewis, still Jeff.

00:04:30.034 --> 00:04:34.946
MATT: All right, cool. Then, unless we have
anything else to announce, let's get into

00:04:34.946 --> 00:04:39.537
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:04:39.537 --> 00:06:09.122
[dramatic music]

00:06:09.182 --> 00:06:16.182
MATT: Welcome back. So, getting us up to speed as
to what happened last time. Vox Machina had

00:06:16.182 --> 00:06:21.849
recently been visited by an old ally, Scanlan
Shorthalt, who had spent the past year or so--

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:23.266
LAURA: An old ally.

00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:35.059
MATT: Yeah. Hey. Building a reputation and a
criminal ring in Ank'harel as a forging master in

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:45.829
various types of furniture and accoutrements. And
upon realizing through the aid of one his hired help,

00:06:45.829 --> 00:06:54.519
Lionel, or Chud. Chad? Chod. Whatever the various
pronunciations were that came through. Discovered

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:59.932
that there was a second sphere, apparently on some
sort of pyramid-like ziggurat structure not far

00:06:59.932 --> 00:07:05.504
from Ank'harel. Upon you returning as Scanlan to
notify the party, you all made your way to

00:07:05.504 --> 00:07:11.762
Ank'harel, briefly met with Kaylie, and saw a
little bit of the setup that they've been building

00:07:11.762 --> 00:07:16.764
for the past year or so, and then made your way
towards the Smouldercrown Mountains to the

00:07:16.764 --> 00:07:23.054
southeast of Ank'harel, where apparently this
structure resides and this cult, that is apparently

00:07:23.054 --> 00:07:29.881
sacrificing objects of magical power towards this
black sphere. So you made your way to the

00:07:29.881 --> 00:07:33.295
outskirts of this mountain, discovered that the
entrance that was previously there had been

00:07:33.295 --> 00:07:40.722
collapsed, and discovered a new, carved entrance
into the mountain, were beset by a few traps, made

00:07:40.722 --> 00:07:46.627
your way into a far corner, set up a mansion, and
after dealing rather briskly with a cluster of

00:07:46.627 --> 00:07:52.051
undead that had built up on the outside of your
entryway to your magnificent mansion, you made

00:07:52.051 --> 00:07:57.451
your way to the final chamber where the structure
was residing. A number of cultists there were in

00:07:57.451 --> 00:08:01.874
the process of quickly, hastily throwing these
objects to the top and then noticed that you had

00:08:01.874 --> 00:08:09.525
come as interlopers into this space. At which
point you realized the head of cult, at least this

00:08:09.525 --> 00:08:16.802
group here at the top of the pyramid, was none
other, seemingly, than Lady Delilah Briarwood.

00:08:16.802 --> 00:08:20.023
ALL: No, no, no!

00:08:20.023 --> 00:08:27.278
MATT: Who then protected herself and two of her
cult members beneath the veil of a Prismatic Wall

00:08:27.278 --> 00:08:32.653
in the shape of a sphere, and you did battle with
a number of undead and other cultists and

00:08:32.653 --> 00:08:36.922
followers of the Whispered One that involved
largely just throwing a bunch of them into the

00:08:36.922 --> 00:08:43.616
ceiling, including yourselves, thanks to a
well-placed Reverse Gravity. Scanlan had darted

00:08:43.616 --> 00:08:48.378
past the Prismatic Wall with a clever use of
Dimension Door.

00:08:48.378 --> 00:08:49.531
SAM: Should've died.

00:08:49.531 --> 00:08:54.712
MATT: Actually, no. Looking at the rules, too. It
was a good call to bring it back, in my opinion.

00:08:54.712 --> 00:09:03.484
But nevertheless, they escaped seemingly into the
sphere, Delilah and two of these cultists, after

00:09:03.484 --> 00:09:09.803
turning it from this glowing white back into its
black magic-absorbing self, leaving you all there.

00:09:09.803 --> 00:09:17.081
Managed to cleanse Pike of her Feeblemind spell,
and after acquiring a few of these magical

00:09:17.081 --> 00:09:22.897
artifacts that were left unbroken, and some cult
robes, and apparently symbols of this cult of the

00:09:22.897 --> 00:09:27.706
Whispered One, you now stand in the middle of this
cavern on the outside of where this second

00:09:27.706 --> 00:09:32.642
Ziggurat exists, deciding what to do next, and
what the next step of this journey means for you.

00:09:32.642 --> 00:09:35.709
So, Vox Machina, what would you like to do?

00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:39.384
LAURA: What should we do next? What does the next
step on this journey mean for us?

00:09:39.384 --> 00:09:42.262
LIAM: I'm getting wicked deja-vu, brah.

00:09:42.262 --> 00:09:47.250
MARISHA: That was so existential of you, Vex.
Wow.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:52.156
LAURA: No, but really. What should we fucking do?
Should we go through it?

00:09:52.156 --> 00:09:55.748
MARISHA: That was a really meaty spell she had.
I've never seen that before.

00:09:55.748 --> 00:09:58.763
ASHLEY: Thank you, Keyleth, for bringing me back.

00:09:58.763 --> 00:10:01.498
SAM: I don't know how much time has passed since
the fight, but

00:10:01.498 --> 00:10:04.753
can Taryon cast Revivify on Doty still?

00:10:04.753 --> 00:10:07.862
MATT: No, that much time has passed,
unfortunately.

00:10:07.862 --> 00:10:09.222
LAURA: Doty's gone again?

00:10:09.222 --> 00:10:10.887
TRAVIS: Did you lose a second one?

00:10:10.887 --> 00:10:13.620
SAM: I came back to get him!

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.951
TRAVIS: He's like iPhones, they just come out
every so often.

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:23.722
TALIESIN: The Doty 6 is going to have a much
better camera. It's going to have better voice

00:10:23.722 --> 00:10:25.973
recognition. You're really going to be happy with
it.

00:10:25.973 --> 00:10:32.797
MATT: You could use the same funds to bring that
Doty back, it would just take you the week in

00:10:32.797 --> 00:10:36.864
reconstruction anyway. But you're not losing that
Doty. The other one, you unfortunately lost in the

00:10:36.864 --> 00:10:41.575
City of Dis, but this can be brought back at the
same cost of a new one. So you're not having to

00:10:41.575 --> 00:10:43.318
reconstruct an entirely new Doty.

00:10:43.318 --> 00:10:44.653
MARISHA: Recycling.

00:10:44.653 --> 00:10:45.797
MATT: Yeah.

00:10:45.797 --> 00:10:48.153
SAM: But I have to get his body somewhere.

00:10:48.153 --> 00:10:49.295
MATT: Yes, you do.

00:10:49.295 --> 00:10:50.507
SAM: Great.

00:10:50.507 --> 00:10:52.672
TALIESIN: I kind of want to collapse this cave.

00:10:52.672 --> 00:10:54.488
TRAVIS: With us in it?

00:10:54.488 --> 00:11:02.518
TALIESIN: No, not with us in it. I don't think we
can destroy the ziggurat, but I think we can at

00:11:02.518 --> 00:11:07.362
least make it extremely difficult to find and get
to, and make it very uncomfortable for anything

00:11:07.362 --> 00:11:09.142
that tries to come through.

00:11:09.142 --> 00:11:11.113
LAURA: That's true. That would be smart.

00:11:11.113 --> 00:11:13.638
SAM: But then we can't come through.

00:11:13.638 --> 00:11:16.886
LAURA: We have another entrance. We have the one
in Whitestone.

00:11:16.886 --> 00:11:22.783
LIAM: Also, though, this is an exit. Do you want
the only exit to be in your basement? The only

00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:26.464
one? Or are there more of these places?

00:11:26.464 --> 00:11:31.423
SAM: Also, does each portal go to the same place,
or do they go to different parts?

00:11:31.423 --> 00:11:34.355
TALIESIN: We saw the spire in both images,
correct?

00:11:34.355 --> 00:11:41.728
MATT: With the brief glance through the-- Well,
the arrow was in the one beneath Whitestone.

00:11:41.728 --> 00:11:48.120
Through your connecting with Sarenrae, the vision
that you received through that portal seemed to be

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.473
very similar to what Vex described seeing through
her arrow.

00:11:52.473 --> 00:11:57.833
LAURA: It could be the same portal or they could
both be within view of the tower.

00:11:57.833 --> 00:12:00.287
TALIESIN: I'm imagining a circle of spheres.

00:12:00.287 --> 00:12:03.333
MARISHA: And both seem to suck magic in, correct?

00:12:03.333 --> 00:12:05.175
LAURA: Yeah, they do the same thing.

00:12:05.175 --> 00:12:11.125
TALIESIN: I think we'll have an easier time
keeping track of what is coming in and out if we

00:12:11.125 --> 00:12:14.091
just have one to deal with as opposed to two.

00:12:14.091 --> 00:12:16.105
LAURA: That's assuming there's only two.

00:12:16.105 --> 00:12:21.988
TRAVIS: Is it a stupid idea to shoot another
Oracle Arrow through this one

00:12:21.988 --> 00:12:23.575
and see if it looks the same?

00:12:23.575 --> 00:12:25.480
TALIESIN: I don't know if we have the option.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:31.986
LAURA: I can try, but in Whitestone, there was at
least a visual path toward the ball, but I don't

00:12:31.986 --> 00:12:33.906
think there is one here, is there?

00:12:33.906 --> 00:12:35.266
MATT: Not within the radius.

00:12:35.266 --> 00:12:36.864
LAURA: Not within the magic orb.

00:12:36.864 --> 00:12:38.115
MARISHA: It's too tight a room?

00:12:38.115 --> 00:12:44.139
LIAM: I think I like your idea, but I worry that
we're upping the odds of-- Listen, we just found

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:49.498
out that she's alive, or something. She's going to
unleash some sort of fresh hell somewhere. We're

00:12:49.498 --> 00:12:52.295
upping the odds of it happening under your living
room.

00:12:52.295 --> 00:13:00.044
TALIESIN: I know. It's just, what if it happens in
both places at once?

00:13:00.044 --> 00:13:02.686
LAURA: What if we collapse the one in Whitestone?

00:13:02.686 --> 00:13:08.675
TALIESIN: It's directly under the castle. We would
have to maybe fill it with, I don't know. Submerge

00:13:08.675 --> 00:13:10.046
it or some such.

00:13:10.046 --> 00:13:13.426
LAURA: At least try to block off the entrance to
where they can't get out.

00:13:13.426 --> 00:13:21.072
MARISHA: Is there an underground water source near
Whitestone?

00:13:21.072 --> 00:13:22.771
TALIESIN: There's acid pits.

00:13:22.771 --> 00:13:25.028
MARISHA: We could try and flood it with acid.

00:13:25.028 --> 00:13:30.129
ASHLEY: What if we blocked off that entrance when
we go inside?

00:13:30.129 --> 00:13:35.437
TALIESIN: Let's at least make sure this cave is
collapsed. We'll leave the chamber standing, but

00:13:35.437 --> 00:13:39.914
every entrance to this cave should be collapsed.
We know there's three of them.

00:13:39.914 --> 00:13:44.135
LAURA: What if we block this one, and then we
block the one in Whitestone, and then we just--

00:13:44.135 --> 00:13:45.418
SAM: Game over!

00:13:45.418 --> 00:13:48.568
LAURA: I think we win, then, right?

00:13:48.568 --> 00:13:52.105
TALIESIN: We'll be able to get back in if we need
to, we just want to make sure that no one can

00:13:52.105 --> 00:13:55.065
wander in and out of here without making a bit of
a ruckus.

00:13:55.065 --> 00:13:57.656
LAURA: So there are three entrances that we know
of, and we need to block all of them.

00:13:57.656 --> 00:13:58.934
TALIESIN: One's already blocked.

00:13:58.934 --> 00:14:02.666
SAM: And one, do we know where it is?

00:14:02.666 --> 00:14:04.472
LAURA: There's one up top that we heard about.

00:14:04.472 --> 00:14:10.341
LIAM: How much time do I have left on my wings? A
lot, probably, like a half hour or 40 minutes? It

00:14:10.341 --> 00:14:11.894
wasn't that long.

00:14:11.894 --> 00:14:17.406
MATT: Well, no, actually, because when you used
your wings outside, you guys came inside. Did you

00:14:17.406 --> 00:14:18.983
use your wings during the battle?

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:20.090
LIAM: Yeah, I did.

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:23.494
MATT: Did you guys take a long rest?

00:14:23.494 --> 00:14:25.335
TALIESIN: We did, because we had the mansion.

00:14:25.335 --> 00:14:30.110
MATT: You did. So by this conversation happening,
the rummaging through the bodies, inspecting the

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.058
vicinity, I'd say you maybe have 20 more minutes
on your wings.

00:14:33.058 --> 00:14:37.020
LAURA: Oh yeah, did we rummage through the bodies?
Let's rummage through those bodies.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.688
MATT: You did, that's how you found the objects.

00:14:39.688 --> 00:14:45.730
MARISHA: While they rummage, Keyleth wants to test
the radius.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.565
SAM: No, we found the objects on that cart.

00:14:47.565 --> 00:14:50.110
MATT: That's right, you found them on the cart.
You did not actually rummage through the bodies.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.347
LAURA: Is there anything on the bodies?

00:14:52.347 --> 00:14:56.819
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:14:56.819 --> 00:15:01.414
LAURA: Whoa, that was high. 23.

00:15:01.414 --> 00:15:08.720
MATT: 23, okay. Over the next 15 or so minutes, as
you go through and begin to gather the corpses,

00:15:08.776 --> 00:15:15.441
most of the skeletons out here that have armor on,
it's old, rusted, destroyed, broken armor, and the

00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:21.043
weapons either fell apart in the battle against
you or are just barely usable or functional at

00:15:21.043 --> 00:15:26.985
this point in time. Of the various cultists'
bodies, the armor on the black guard that you were

00:15:26.985 --> 00:15:40.327
battling is a pretty nice-looking set of full
plate. You also find similar symbols, these dark

00:15:40.327 --> 00:15:44.413
iron necklaces that you found on the previous
cultists.

00:15:44.413 --> 00:15:47.800
LAURA: We'll take those. We can take the plate
armor if there's room for it in the bag, and then

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.544
see if it's actually magical outside of the
field.

00:15:49.544 --> 00:15:52.929
TALIESIN: How many of those necklaces have we
found?

00:15:52.929 --> 00:15:54.594
MATT: Six.

00:15:54.594 --> 00:15:55.810
TALIESIN: Six necklaces.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:59.120
LAURA: All right, and we already had two, so now
all of us have one.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.571
TRAVIS: I can make room in the Bag of Holding for
the armor, but I have to get rid of one of these

00:16:02.571 --> 00:16:07.295
two bodies. Does anybody object if I throw one of
the bodies at the little black marble?

00:16:07.295 --> 00:16:09.051
LIAM: I would kind of like to see that.

00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:14.552
TALIESIN: Actually, I think that's a pretty good
idea, but you have to remove it from the bag

00:16:14.552 --> 00:16:16.049
before you walk over to the marble.

00:16:16.049 --> 00:16:17.056
TRAVIS: I have to what?

00:16:17.056 --> 00:16:19.013
TALIESIN: You have to remove the body from the bag
before you walk over.

00:16:19.013 --> 00:16:23.687
TRAVIS: Oh right, okay. So can I walk back to the
fork?

00:16:23.687 --> 00:16:25.484
TALIESIN: Remove them both.

00:16:25.538 --> 00:16:27.953
TRAVIS: Back to the fork. I pull out-- both? We
only need one.

00:16:27.953 --> 00:16:29.041
TALIESIN: All right.

00:16:29.041 --> 00:16:30.856
TRAVIS: I pull one body out.

00:16:30.856 --> 00:16:32.291
LAURA: He likes to save his bodies for later.

00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:34.777
TRAVIS: Listen, I'll run my store the way I run my
store. I pull one body out.

00:16:34.777 --> 00:16:38.996
MATT: Which, just as a note, the visual of Grog
pulling this body out of the Bag of Holding is

00:16:38.996 --> 00:16:47.503
much like trying to pull a Slim Jim out of the
wrapper. It pulls weird and you have to yank.

00:16:47.503 --> 00:16:50.487
TRAVIS: What an analogy. The sausage without the
casing.

00:16:50.487 --> 00:16:55.876
MATT: Yeah, it's like by sections, and you watch
him strain as you pull some out and it folds over.

00:16:55.876 --> 00:17:05.069
It's just really awkward and awful. But yeah, you
manage to get the body out.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:08.953
TRAVIS: Close the Bag of Holding and I just drag
him back over.

00:17:08.953 --> 00:17:10.722
MATT: (impacts) Up each step.

00:17:10.722 --> 00:17:16.293
TRAVIS: Everybody ready? And a one, and a two, and
a (whoosh).

00:17:16.293 --> 00:17:22.062
MATT: As you throw it, it impacts, and you watch
as the body stops in mid-air from the gravity,

00:17:22.062 --> 00:17:27.000
stopping where it stands. Its legs fold over, and
like a broken physics engine, you watch as the

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.106
body (crackling) twists, cracks, and gets sucked
in.

00:17:31.106 --> 00:17:35.538
LAURA: Let's not do that. Let's not go through
that hole.

00:17:35.538 --> 00:17:37.727
TRAVIS: It really doesn't seem that bad.

00:17:37.727 --> 00:17:42.841
TALIESIN: I kind of want to experiment. Would you
mind losing one of the necklaces, or no?

00:17:42.841 --> 00:17:45.906
LAURA: We can try.

00:17:45.906 --> 00:17:48.820
TALIESIN: Let's put a necklace on the other
cadaver and then throw it through.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:52.804
TRAVIS: I literally just walked all the way over
there and now you want me to go back?

00:17:52.804 --> 00:17:57.231
TALIESIN: You need the cardio, let's not pretend
you don't. We're going to put one of the necklaces

00:17:57.231 --> 00:18:03.133
on the body and throw it through. It'll still be
fun to watch.

00:18:03.133 --> 00:18:08.189
TRAVIS: I walk back out of the realm of the thing,
pinching my belly fat because apparently Percy

00:18:08.189 --> 00:18:10.089
thinks I'm a couple pounds heavy.

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:12.489
LAURA: It's all that ale, Grog.

00:18:12.489 --> 00:18:18.845
TALIESIN: I can only mock you on graph paper. I
take what I can fucking get, man.

00:18:18.845 --> 00:18:21.053
TRAVIS: I'll pull the other Slim Jim out of the
bag.

00:18:21.053 --> 00:18:29.869
MATT: (suction sound) You place one of the various
symbols around its neck and then Babe Ruth-style

00:18:29.869 --> 00:18:37.178
lob it, and you watch as it gets within a certain
proximity, the orb seems to shimmer and shift open

00:18:37.178 --> 00:18:43.051
ever so slightly. It's similar to what you saw, it
opened to a mouthed gateway when Delilah and the

00:18:43.051 --> 00:18:48.105
other cultists walked through. The body still
rattles, and you watch it twist a bit, but it's a

00:18:48.105 --> 00:18:50.600
far less impactful transition.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:58.624
LAURA: All right, so now we have seven of those
things, and we have to get eight of us through.

00:18:58.624 --> 00:19:06.536
TALIESIN: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, yes. Somebody will have to stay behind, but

00:19:06.536 --> 00:19:09.600
we'll figure that out if we go that direction.
There's other options.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.227
SAM: Who's the eighth?

00:19:11.227 --> 00:19:12.460
TALIESIN: You.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:15.109
LAURA: You and you, bitch.

00:19:15.109 --> 00:19:19.482
SAM: I live in Ank'harel and I'm a crime boss.

00:19:19.482 --> 00:19:23.094
LAURA: Yeah, and you're here with us now.

00:19:23.094 --> 00:19:26.524
ASHLEY: You're not planning on going with us?

00:19:26.524 --> 00:19:28.788
SAM: I hadn't been invited.

00:19:28.788 --> 00:19:29.940
LAURA: Scanlan.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:38.542
TRAVIS: That was pretty-- I mean, from a third
party, non-influenced or partial perspective,

00:19:38.542 --> 00:19:41.865
flipping gravity was pretty cool.

00:19:41.865 --> 00:19:47.321
LIAM: Plus, he's got a lot of big words now. You
want to be around to see them in action.

00:19:47.321 --> 00:19:52.040
MARISHA: Technically, I can flip gravity. I don't
know. I felt like I should put it on the table.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.161
SAM: Oh, okay, see, you don't really need me after
all.

00:19:54.161 --> 00:19:57.746
MARISHA: No, that's not what I meant. I just
wanted to be honest.

00:19:57.746 --> 00:19:59.248
LAURA: I haven't seen you do it.

00:19:59.248 --> 00:20:00.945
MARISHA: Well, it hasn't been relevant yet.

00:20:00.945 --> 00:20:06.651
LIAM: You're also really clever. Forget your
spells. And funny, and it's good to have you

00:20:06.651 --> 00:20:10.491
around, so yeah, do you want to go someplace
really horrible with your family, or what?

00:20:10.491 --> 00:20:20.252
SAM: All right. Are you all offering?

00:20:20.252 --> 00:20:24.436
TRAVIS: I don't know, Pike. Can he earn his way
back in in this manner?

00:20:24.436 --> 00:20:29.703
ASHLEY: Well, I do think we could use the help.

00:20:29.703 --> 00:20:41.047
SAM: The help. Okay, that's good enough for me.
I'm in. Will fancy boy be joining us?

00:20:41.047 --> 00:20:43.002
ASHLEY: Are you jealous of him?

00:20:43.002 --> 00:20:45.713
SAM: No. He's part of the team.

00:20:45.713 --> 00:20:48.123
ASHLEY: He is part of the team.

00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:50.097
LAURA: Tary, what do you think?

00:20:50.097 --> 00:20:51.877
SAM: Shit! This again!

00:20:51.877 --> 00:20:57.879
LIAM: Tary, it's up to you, but you were talking
about going back.

00:20:57.879 --> 00:21:01.815
SAM: I'm sorry, I was busy caring for my deceased
robot.

00:21:01.815 --> 00:21:04.232
LAURA: Is Doty...

00:21:04.232 --> 00:21:09.640
SAM: No, he's fine. He'll be fine. I just have to
rebuild him. It'll take some time and money, which

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.891
I don't have.

00:21:10.891 --> 00:21:13.396
ASHLEY: I wish I could help, Tary, but I think
that's out of my...

00:21:13.396 --> 00:21:15.331
TALIESIN: We can get him back to Whitestone, he'll
be perfectly fine.

00:21:15.331 --> 00:21:16.881
We have everything we need there.

00:21:16.881 --> 00:21:19.411
SAM: All right. I need him for the brigade!

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:20.650
TALIESIN: Of course.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.064
LAURA: The brigade, right.

00:21:22.064 --> 00:21:27.856
SAM: Yes. But I can't carry him. Grog, would you
be able to...

00:21:27.856 --> 00:21:40.682
MATT: "I can carry him!" And you look over and
Chod goes over and grabs Doty. (grunt) "Should I

00:21:40.682 --> 00:21:42.646
"put him somewhere?"

00:21:42.646 --> 00:21:46.318
SAM: Not yet, Chod. Wait until we get somewhere
where I can work on it.

00:21:46.318 --> 00:21:48.035
MATT: "Okay."

00:21:48.035 --> 00:21:55.135
TALIESIN: I say we head back to Whitestone. We
gather resources, we figure out how we're getting

00:21:55.135 --> 00:21:56.680
where we're going to get.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.650
MARISHA: We could theoretically forge more of
these, right? Or do you think they're blessed?

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:04.450
TALIESIN: Let's find out. We now know they work.

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:10.427
LIAM: I wonder if we could take them to Allura or
to Shaun.

00:22:10.427 --> 00:22:13.431
LAURA: Well, have Tary Identify them. Maybe it's
something specific.

00:22:13.431 --> 00:22:16.501
MARISHA: Yeah, are they magical, Tary? Are these
magical?

00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:17.617
SAM: Let me look.

00:22:17.617 --> 00:22:18.938
LAURA: Outside of the field.

00:22:18.938 --> 00:22:20.608
MARISHA: Outside of the field.

00:22:20.608 --> 00:22:30.098
MATT: They are magical. It's a mild enchantment.
It's not extremely strong, but it is very

00:22:30.098 --> 00:22:38.054
specific, and it is more of an attunement to a
specific plane. It has something to do with

00:22:38.054 --> 00:22:49.295
whoever's bearing it, or whatever's wearing it, is
already partially crossed to a certain extent, so

00:22:49.295 --> 00:22:54.077
it limits the impact of the transition.

00:22:54.077 --> 00:22:57.523
SAM: Okay. I don't understand any of that. But
there you have it.

00:22:57.523 --> 00:22:59.602
LAURA: Do you have any more Identify left?

00:22:59.602 --> 00:23:00.790
SAM: Sure.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:07.071
LAURA: Can we have you Identify the plate armor
that the big guy was wearing, so we can see if

00:23:07.071 --> 00:23:08.292
it's magical?

00:23:08.292 --> 00:23:09.615
SAM: I do that.

00:23:09.615 --> 00:23:20.605
MATT: Very well. So this is Plate Armor of
Resistance to radiant.

00:23:20.605 --> 00:23:27.326
LAURA: So it's immune to Pike.

00:23:27.326 --> 00:23:29.749
TALIESIN: It's anti-Pike armor.

00:23:29.749 --> 00:23:34.619
MARISHA: Well, that kind of clues us in on a lot,
actually.

00:23:34.619 --> 00:23:39.841
SAM: Chod can't use that, can he?

00:23:39.841 --> 00:23:44.041
MATT: Do you ask this question of him?

00:23:44.041 --> 00:23:45.636
SAM: Chod, can you use this?

00:23:45.636 --> 00:23:48.299
MATT: "Can I have it?"

00:23:48.299 --> 00:23:50.634
SAM: I mean, do we need it?

00:23:50.634 --> 00:23:51.754
ASHLEY: Well...

00:23:51.754 --> 00:23:53.938
SAM: Do we need it?

00:23:53.938 --> 00:23:55.604
TALIESIN: Yes, let's not...

00:23:55.604 --> 00:23:56.929
SAM: Do we need it?

00:23:56.929 --> 00:23:57.942
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:23:57.942 --> 00:24:01.159
TRAVIS: Radiant means all gods or just good gods?

00:24:01.159 --> 00:24:04.763
LAURA: Just good gods I think.

00:24:04.763 --> 00:24:07.580
TALIESIN: I would like to put somebody in this
armor in Whitestone so that whoever comes through

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.033
the portal, the first thing they see is something
that they feel comfortable and familiar with.

00:24:11.033 --> 00:24:14.286
MATT: "Those boots are better than my boots. Can I
have the boots?"

00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:16.500
TALIESIN: Yes. Well, what kind of boots are they?

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.997
MATT: It's full armor plate. They're still part of
the armor set.

00:24:20.997 --> 00:24:27.641
TALIESIN: We can get you something else nice. I
have a plan for this armor!

00:24:27.641 --> 00:24:40.222
LAURA: I have so many things. Wait, hold on, Chod.
There's-- Oh, Chod! Do you want a jewelry box that

00:24:40.222 --> 00:24:41.553
makes music?

00:24:41.553 --> 00:24:43.563
ASHLEY: No, you can't give him that jewelry box!

00:24:43.563 --> 00:24:46.792
MATT: He leans over to Scanlan. "Hey, boss. Do I
want a jewelry box?"

00:24:46.792 --> 00:24:49.030
SAM: Yes. Just say yes.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.839
MATT: "Yes, I would love a jewelry box. Thank
you."

00:24:50.839 --> 00:24:52.801
LAURA: Do you? It makes music. You like music.

00:24:52.801 --> 00:24:54.066
MATT: "It makes music, do I want it?"

00:24:54.066 --> 00:24:55.870
SAM: When a girl offers you something, you just
say yes.

00:24:55.870 --> 00:25:00.653
MATT: "Yes, please. Take all of it." Now he's
carrying the music box and Doty.

00:25:00.653 --> 00:25:02.058
(laughter)

00:25:02.058 --> 00:25:03.595
LAURA: I'll mark that off.

00:25:03.595 --> 00:25:07.965
LIAM: Lionel, I have the perfect thing for you.
And I pull out the metal skullcap.

00:25:07.965 --> 00:25:13.352
MATT: "That's loud."

00:25:13.352 --> 00:25:15.458
LAURA: Wait. Wait. Is that the Clarota one?

00:25:15.458 --> 00:25:20.440
LIAM: No, that's the Lionel Gayheart one. People
will have a harder time

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.956
fucking with you, in general.

00:25:21.956 --> 00:25:26.416
LAURA: That is the Clarota one, wasn't it? You're
giving the Clarota thing,

00:25:26.416 --> 00:25:28.609
the resistance-to-mind stuff?

00:25:28.609 --> 00:25:30.217
LIAM: Yes, I am.

00:25:30.217 --> 00:25:31.952
LAURA: Because we could maybe use that.

00:25:31.952 --> 00:25:33.721
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's still an idiot in this
group.

00:25:33.721 --> 00:25:36.039
LAURA: Yeah, there's maybe a Grog in the group
that could totally use it!

00:25:36.039 --> 00:25:39.092
LIAM: I've had this hat for years.

00:25:39.092 --> 00:25:42.652
LAURA: I know! So maybe you should remember that
you have it and give it to fucking Grog!

00:25:42.652 --> 00:25:47.415
LIAM: I've known that I've had it, and I've talked to him
about it. No one's ever asked about it, you've

00:25:47.415 --> 00:25:48.510
never asked about it.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.789
LAURA: I didn't know you had it!

00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:51.902
LIAM: You are a hoarder. You are many good
things--

00:25:51.902 --> 00:25:57.893
LAURA: No! I'm just saying, if Grog has resistance
to mind control, then that would be really good

00:25:57.893 --> 00:26:00.306
for us in a fight with somebody that's really
powerfully--

00:26:00.306 --> 00:26:04.679
LIAM: Grog. This skullcap that Lionel is wearing
requires attunement. Would you like to give up one

00:26:04.679 --> 00:26:06.863
of your really lethal weapons--

00:26:06.863 --> 00:26:09.461
TRAVIS: No. Didn't we talk about this?

00:26:09.461 --> 00:26:12.697
LAURA: I didn't know it required attunement.

00:26:12.697 --> 00:26:14.215
TALIESIN: Sense of dignity, perhaps?

00:26:14.215 --> 00:26:19.741
TRAVIS: Ooh, hey! Is he heavy? Don't you have your
own Bag of Holding?

00:26:19.741 --> 00:26:21.858
MATT: "No."

00:26:21.858 --> 00:26:23.126
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:26:23.126 --> 00:26:26.632
LAURA: Not everybody has a Bag of Holding, Grog.

00:26:26.632 --> 00:26:29.268
TRAVIS: I'll just give him mine.

00:26:29.268 --> 00:26:32.981
(laughter)

00:26:32.981 --> 00:26:36.298
LAURA: We just give him everything.

00:26:36.298 --> 00:26:39.807
TALIESIN: We would turn on you so fast. Let's get
back to Whitestone.

00:26:39.807 --> 00:26:43.091
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. How do we collapse these
tunnels--

00:26:43.091 --> 00:26:44.862
MATT: "You guys can keep putting things on me.
That's fine."

00:26:44.862 --> 00:26:47.823
TALIESIN: Well, we have, thankfully, a
professional tunnel collapser.

00:26:47.823 --> 00:26:49.237
LAURA: Well, that's true!

00:26:49.237 --> 00:26:50.984
TRAVIS: Yep. Oh, me?

00:26:50.984 --> 00:26:54.493
TALIESIN: So let's find the upstairs entrance and
get rid of that--

00:26:54.493 --> 00:26:56.606
LAURA: I'll do that from outside.

00:26:56.606 --> 00:27:03.145
MARISHA: I was trying to test the radius of this
sphere, too. Am I still doing that?

00:27:03.145 --> 00:27:04.571
Is that still relevant?

00:27:04.571 --> 00:27:07.177
TALIESIN: Well, it's worth noting just in case we
cannot find the opening.

00:27:07.177 --> 00:27:12.319
MATT: It comes to about 180 feet from the actual
sphere.

00:27:12.319 --> 00:27:16.788
MARISHA: Wow! That's a long way. It's the same as
the other one?

00:27:16.788 --> 00:27:23.898
MATT: It's similar from when you originally tested
it. It was about the width of the whole chamber

00:27:23.898 --> 00:27:28.900
underneath Whitestone. And that chamber was more
cleared out, more of the actual structure was

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:33.280
visible. This one is still partially buried and
you're only seeing the upper half of it.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.714
MARISHA: Okay.

00:27:34.714 --> 00:27:38.976
LIAM: Do I even have the ability to fly in here?
Is there an outer edge where the magic is not--

00:27:38.976 --> 00:27:40.356
MATT: In that chamber, you cannot fly.

00:27:40.356 --> 00:27:41.329
LIAM: Cannot. Okay.

00:27:41.329 --> 00:27:45.444
LAURA: And I feel like we're going to run into
traps if we try to find it from this way. Maybe

00:27:45.444 --> 00:27:47.347
find it from the outside and just collapse it.

00:27:47.347 --> 00:27:48.369
TALIESIN: All right.

00:27:48.369 --> 00:27:50.864
LAURA: That way we don't have to go through a
series of shit.

00:27:50.864 --> 00:27:56.723
TALIESIN: Let's double-reinforce, just pile-drive
the one that's already a little collapsed and make

00:27:56.723 --> 00:27:59.844
it really collapsed. And then we'll collapse the
others while we're leaving.

00:27:59.844 --> 00:28:00.942
LAURA: Yeah.

00:28:00.942 --> 00:28:04.295
TRAVIS: (happy grunts) Is that permission?

00:28:04.295 --> 00:28:08.747
TALIESIN: That is more than permission. That is
permission and an audience. We're very excited.

00:28:08.747 --> 00:28:13.316
TRAVIS: That's amazing. I'll go for it, and I'll
whack on a wall. Do I just hit a wall anywhere?

00:28:13.316 --> 00:28:15.224
LAURA: Just in the tunnels, maybe?

00:28:15.224 --> 00:28:18.005
SAM: Wait. You're an engineer, aren't you?

00:28:18.005 --> 00:28:21.005
TALIESIN: Yes. No, we're going to be pointing at
the things that need to collapse.

00:28:21.005 --> 00:28:22.606
TRAVIS: Okay, I'm ready any time.

00:28:22.606 --> 00:28:26.750
LAURA: Do you want to go up and see if we can find
the thing up top?

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.055
MARISHA: Yeah! Sure! You guys have fun
collapsing.

00:28:29.055 --> 00:28:31.422
LAURA: It's daytime now, right? Outside?

00:28:31.422 --> 00:28:33.975
MATT: At this time, it would be. Yes.

00:28:33.975 --> 00:28:36.611
LAURA: So can me and Keyleth go try to find the
entrance up top so

00:28:36.611 --> 00:28:38.268
we can do something to that one?

00:28:38.268 --> 00:28:39.353
Matt: Sure, okay.

00:28:39.353 --> 00:28:41.258
TRAVIS: Or should we wait 'til we collapse the
tunnels?

00:28:41.258 --> 00:28:44.136
TALIESIN: Well, they can find theirs while we get
our tunnels collapsed.

00:28:44.136 --> 00:28:46.048
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm sure it won't fall on me. No big
deal.

00:28:46.048 --> 00:28:49.495
ASHLEY: I'm going to help! I'm going to help you.

00:28:49.495 --> 00:28:50.469
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:28:50.469 --> 00:28:51.372
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:28:51.372 --> 00:28:54.137
MARISHA: If it falls on you, we can fish you out.
Just survive a little bit.

00:28:54.137 --> 00:28:59.721
ASHLEY: Keyleth's got our back. She'll burrow in
and pull us out.

00:28:59.721 --> 00:29:02.524
LAURA: Just earring us if something happens.

00:29:02.524 --> 00:29:07.116
MARISHA: Badger. Badgers burrow, right? Do badgers
burrow?

00:29:07.116 --> 00:29:08.129
LIAM: They do burrow.

00:29:08.129 --> 00:29:10.814
TRAVIS: That's why I said stay, but that's all
right!

00:29:10.814 --> 00:29:16.596
MATT: (laughs) All righty. So you guys all make
your way back to the second entrance, the hidden,

00:29:16.596 --> 00:29:21.009
illusory one. You all back out of it, leaving just
Pike and Grog on the inside.

00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:25.293
TALIESIN: And we're helping them figure out where
to punch to make everything--

00:29:25.293 --> 00:29:28.562
MATT: Okay, cool. So I need you to go ahead and make
an investigation check.

00:29:28.562 --> 00:29:29.794
TALIESIN: All right.

00:29:29.794 --> 00:29:31.913
MATT: And you can assist him, which gives him
advantage.

00:29:31.913 --> 00:29:33.724
SAM: Ah. I will assist you.

00:29:33.724 --> 00:29:39.106
TALIESIN: Thank you. Oh, yes. That's excellent.
It's a 19.

00:29:39.106 --> 00:29:40.483
(laughter)

00:29:40.483 --> 00:29:46.754
MATT: Total of 19? Okay. Halfway through the
hallway, you find the place where the initial

00:29:46.754 --> 00:29:51.477
collapse was started. Or you start looking to see
what they used to destroy the first entrance that

00:29:51.477 --> 00:29:56.950
you were supposed to come through. You can see the
way it's carved, designed, especially the smooth

00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:02.721
entrance. Which, now that you get a better look at
it, that soft, spongy ground, that dust you were

00:30:02.721 --> 00:30:11.758
finding: you begin to recognize the pattern of
what carved its way in. You saw it used at the top

00:30:11.758 --> 00:30:18.740
of the Emberhold when you were fighting the queen
there. It was a series of Disintegration rays used

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:23.023
to carve away into this mountain. That's what that
dust is that's on the ground. And why it's such a

00:30:23.023 --> 00:30:25.145
smooth entrance on this side.

00:30:25.145 --> 00:30:28.493
MARISHA: But I rolled so shitty on that nature
check before, right?

00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:34.985
MATT: Mm-hm. However, because it was just a series
of magic Disintegrations pushed through to create

00:30:34.985 --> 00:30:42.348
this second opening, it's a little harder to find
points in the structure where the weakness is. So

00:30:42.348 --> 00:30:48.327
you begin to cut away at some areas, you get like
a small axe or one of the various objects that

00:30:48.327 --> 00:30:50.862
you've-- pointed objects that you've acquired over
the--

00:30:50.862 --> 00:30:52.565
TRAVIS: I do have just a regular pickaxe.

00:30:52.565 --> 00:30:57.754
MATT: Yeah. And you just hit at some areas, and
you do find one section where you would think it

00:30:57.754 --> 00:31:02.253
would be a relatively weak point of impact between
the various rocks and stones that hold this up.

00:31:02.253 --> 00:31:06.643
TALIESIN: Hit this and stand on this side of it,
and that should do some intense damage.

00:31:06.643 --> 00:31:08.592
MATT: You would recommend hitting it and then
running.

00:31:08.592 --> 00:31:10.113
TALIESIN: And run in this direction.

00:31:10.113 --> 00:31:11.763
(laughter)

00:31:11.763 --> 00:31:12.895
TRAVIS: Okay, Pike.

00:31:12.895 --> 00:31:13.668
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:31:13.668 --> 00:31:17.921
TRAVIS: I want you to warm up this spot for me,
and then you're going to jump on my back and then

00:31:17.921 --> 00:31:19.263
I'm going to hit it.

00:31:19.263 --> 00:31:22.491
ASHLEY: Okay. I jump on your back now?

00:31:22.491 --> 00:31:24.171
TRAVIS: No, no, you hit it.

00:31:24.171 --> 00:31:25.325
ASHLEY: Like a backpack?

00:31:25.325 --> 00:31:27.138
TRAVIS: Yeah, and then you can come up on my
back.

00:31:27.138 --> 00:31:28.319
ASHLEY: Oh, I hit it.

00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:32.447
LIAM: Do we jump on three, or is it one, two,
three, go?

00:31:32.447 --> 00:31:39.439
MATT: Pike. Go ahead and make a strength check, as
Grog throws you up to the ceiling to where the one

00:31:39.439 --> 00:31:42.490
place in the rock structure is.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:43.966
ASHLEY: Yeah boi.

00:31:43.966 --> 00:31:46.826
TRAVIS: Ready to run, just in case she just goes
beast mode.

00:31:46.826 --> 00:31:50.726
MARISHA: We should make little Pike backpacks.

00:31:50.726 --> 00:31:54.639
LAURA: Oh my gosh, how cute would that be?

00:31:54.639 --> 00:31:57.380
SAM: With, like, Ashley's face right here.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.170
(laughter)

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:01.248
ASHLEY: No, guys, that doesn't need to be
anywhere.

00:32:01.248 --> 00:32:03.859
LIAM: We'll just repurpose those Yoda bags.

00:32:03.859 --> 00:32:04.958
ASHLEY: 13.

00:32:04.958 --> 00:32:09.358
MATT: 13? Okay, so you take her and you alley-oop
and you (impact) hit it and you watch it

00:32:09.358 --> 00:32:14.835
(cracking) and some dust falls and settles. A
couple of small pebbles (falling pebbles). And you

00:32:14.835 --> 00:32:17.671
grab her like, oh! Okay, seems okay for now.

00:32:17.671 --> 00:32:19.598
TRAVIS: All right. Get on, Yoda.

00:32:19.598 --> 00:32:24.354
ASHLEY: I try to wrap my legs around, but they
don't go.

00:32:24.354 --> 00:32:25.676
TRAVIS: I rage first.

00:32:25.676 --> 00:32:31.883
MARISHA: Just her but with, like, a jockey on a
horse. (straining)

00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:35.241
MATT: Okay, so it just happens naturally. So go
ahead and roll a strength check with advantage.

00:32:35.241 --> 00:32:37.198
MARISHA: Those gnomish thighs.

00:32:37.198 --> 00:32:39.285
TRAVIS: 23.

00:32:39.285 --> 00:32:46.741
MATT: 23. So for the height of the cavern here,
you get yourself a nice-- you crouch low and full

00:32:46.741 --> 00:32:53.925
shoryuken-style, like (impact) punch into the roof
and as you hit it, impact and go clean through and

00:32:53.925 --> 00:32:57.702
bring it to the ground. Land, and you hear the
(crumbling).

00:32:57.702 --> 00:32:59.205
TALIESIN: All right, run.

00:32:59.205 --> 00:33:04.093
MATT: You guys start bolting through, and as
you're rushing, Pike, you're looking over and you

00:33:04.093 --> 00:33:11.607
can see the walls (impacts). You guys are bolting
out as well. Both of you guys go ahead and make

00:33:11.607 --> 00:33:13.322
dexterity saving throws, please.

00:33:13.322 --> 00:33:14.942
TRAVIS: I forgot we had to roll for this part.

00:33:14.942 --> 00:33:15.877
ASHLEY: Me too.

00:33:15.877 --> 00:33:17.002
TRAVIS: I got advantage.

00:33:17.002 --> 00:33:18.809
LAURA: Oh god, don't drop Pikeys.

00:33:18.809 --> 00:33:20.045
TRAVIS: Oh, that's good.

00:33:20.045 --> 00:33:21.888
ASHLEY: Okay okay, 16.

00:33:21.888 --> 00:33:25.350
TRAVIS: 20. No-- 18.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:30.920
MATT: Okay, so as you guys are bolting, you're
holding onto Grog, and you manage to look behind

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.942
just fast enough to see one of the walls is
about to full-on collapse at the side, and you go

00:33:34.942 --> 00:33:39.093
ahead and grab the side of Grog's ear and yank his
vision that way.

00:33:39.139 --> 00:33:40.462
TRAVIS: (groan)

00:33:40.462 --> 00:33:42.390
ASHLEY: Just going to start kicking him in the
side.

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:46.036
MATT: He starts turning off to that side, and you
manage to just avoid that side of the wall as it

00:33:46.036 --> 00:33:46.960
(impact).

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.211
SAM: Gif it! Gif it!

00:33:48.211 --> 00:33:51.089
(laughter)

00:33:51.089 --> 00:33:54.876
MATT: So you start steering him from behind like a
prized racehorse, and making your way through this

00:33:54.876 --> 00:33:59.898
cavern until eventually the back half of the
cavern collapses and comes to a rest. The front

00:33:59.898 --> 00:34:04.965
half is not collapsing, but you do-- you have a
large portion of the path leading to the ziggurat

00:34:04.965 --> 00:34:06.585
is now just rubble and rocks.

00:34:06.585 --> 00:34:09.177
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay! Good job!

00:34:09.177 --> 00:34:10.455
TRAVIS: Nice job!

00:34:10.455 --> 00:34:11.589
TALIESIN: Well done, well done.

00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:17.305
ASHLEY: We're getting somewhere. But we still
need-- there's still more to do?

00:34:17.305 --> 00:34:23.259
LAURA: Yeah, there's that whole other path. There's
that whole-- there's that whole other path and

00:34:23.259 --> 00:34:24.746
then the one up top.

00:34:24.746 --> 00:34:25.655
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:34:25.655 --> 00:34:28.136
LAURA: But I could hear a rumble so I know you
guys did good on one of those paths already.

00:34:28.136 --> 00:34:29.572
ASHLEY: Thanks! We did pretty good.

00:34:29.572 --> 00:34:35.491
MATT: Okay. The rest of it is fairly easy to do
because you find the closer you get to the

00:34:35.491 --> 00:34:40.996
entrance, based on the previous collapsing,
elements of it have started to show cracks, like

00:34:40.996 --> 00:34:45.248
the actual weight, because it was just a smooth
transition there. There was no load-bearing

00:34:45.248 --> 00:34:51.952
platforms or any sort of general structure to the
interior of this cavern. So you guys manage to

00:34:51.952 --> 00:34:56.305
pummel your way out, a large spinning punch on
this side and this side as you're rushing out, and

00:34:56.305 --> 00:34:59.687
as you do (impacts) you hear it slamming and
hitting the ground behind you until you guys

00:34:59.687 --> 00:35:02.690
emerge through. It looks like you're running
straight at a wall because the illusory wall is

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:09.314
still there, but you both just out the other side.
Immediate hot daylight hits you, the blaring sun

00:35:09.314 --> 00:35:17.864
of the Marquet sky. Clear blue sky, no clouds.
You're now surrounded by a series of browned and

00:35:17.864 --> 00:35:21.832
leafless trees with these large canopies that have
the same pear-like

00:35:21.832 --> 00:35:23.997
fruit hanging from the branches.

00:35:23.997 --> 00:35:25.766
TRAVIS: Fruit? Fruit?

00:35:25.766 --> 00:35:27.272
MATT: Looks like fruit.

00:35:27.272 --> 00:35:28.517
TRAVIS: Are you hungry?

00:35:28.517 --> 00:35:29.464
ASHLEY: I'm hungry!

00:35:29.464 --> 00:35:32.076
TRAVIS: Hold on. I hold up Pike to go grab some
fruit.

00:35:32.076 --> 00:35:33.910
ASHLEY: We'll check it!

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:35.513
TRAVIS: Don't worry, it's just fruit.

00:35:35.513 --> 00:35:37.046
MATT: Make a nature check.

00:35:37.046 --> 00:35:38.490
LIAM: She can cure us of poison.

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:42.651
TALIESIN: Not if she's busy dying from both ends.

00:35:42.651 --> 00:35:46.447
LAURA: (retching) The spins.

00:35:46.447 --> 00:35:48.504
ASHLEY: Six.

00:35:48.504 --> 00:35:51.453
MATT: It's hard to tell, but it looks really
tasty.

00:35:51.453 --> 00:35:59.242
TRAVIS: Yeah, I got great nature skills! Five.

00:35:59.242 --> 00:36:02.915
MATT: So. Looks tasty.

00:36:02.915 --> 00:36:04.783
ASHLEY: You know what, Grog?

00:36:04.783 --> 00:36:05.674
TRAVIS: What?

00:36:05.674 --> 00:36:10.288
ASHLEY: As hungry as I am, I think we should wait
to have Keyleth look at this fruit.

00:36:10.288 --> 00:36:11.808
TRAVIS: Why? It's just fruit!

00:36:11.808 --> 00:36:18.080
ASHLEY: Because it's outside of this cave, and
what if it's a distraction like, "Oh, lookit!"

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.520
and you eat it and you just die?

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:25.786
TRAVIS: You know, I've found if fruit, when it
goes bad, falls from the tree, and it's still on

00:36:25.786 --> 00:36:27.286
it! Therefore!

00:36:27.286 --> 00:36:30.093
ASHLEY: And when fruit goes bad, it turns into
wine!

00:36:30.093 --> 00:36:31.917
TRAVIS: You get crunk drunk!

00:36:31.917 --> 00:36:36.202
ASHLEY: I think I'm going to wait for Keyleth.

00:36:36.202 --> 00:36:37.933
TRAVIS: I'm going to have a bite.

00:36:37.933 --> 00:36:48.842
MATT: Okay. You take a bite and it's got a fairly
moist center. You can see now, like a cactus, the

00:36:48.842 --> 00:36:55.472
fruits here, most of the moisture is retained
within these fruit elements. The flavor, it's not

00:36:55.472 --> 00:37:03.941
sweet, it's quite pungent, actually. It has a
bitterness to it. It's like putting your tongue in

00:37:03.941 --> 00:37:05.561
a bunch of lye.

00:37:05.561 --> 00:37:09.730
ASHLEY: Does it taste good?

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:14.147
TRAVIS: (disgusted noises)

00:37:14.147 --> 00:37:19.336
ASHLEY: Maybe make some mayonnaise or something?
Want some mayonnaise to cleanse your palate?

00:37:19.336 --> 00:37:26.523
TRAVIS: I take out the jug and I go: honey! Hey!

00:37:26.523 --> 00:37:29.441
ASHLEY: Oh, all right!

00:37:29.441 --> 00:37:33.742
LAURA: Just a couple of sticky warriors.

00:37:33.742 --> 00:37:35.267
ASHLEY: No, Grog!

00:37:35.267 --> 00:37:44.954
MATT: Just as a breeze blows a bit of a dust cloud
through, which coats your sticky hands with heavy

00:37:44.954 --> 00:37:51.118
desert sand. You chew for a minute and feel the
crunch of granules inside your mouth where you

00:37:51.118 --> 00:37:53.217
inhaled. (crunching)

00:37:53.217 --> 00:37:55.181
TRAVIS: Jug goes away.

00:37:55.181 --> 00:37:58.188
MATT: Back to you guys. You were looking for the
other entrance?

00:37:58.188 --> 00:37:59.305
LAURA: Yeah, up top.

00:37:59.305 --> 00:38:00.290
MATT: Investigation check.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:05.030
LAURA: Both of us are looking for it. We're flying
up. Can you fly? So, we can fly up. I was going to

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:09.037
help you look for it because I figure you have a
better ability to collapse it than I do.

00:38:09.094 --> 00:38:10.779
LIAM: What form are you going to take?

00:38:10.779 --> 00:38:12.354
LAURA: A goldfish!

00:38:12.354 --> 00:38:23.585
MARISHA: You could hold me in your hands. I've got
about 30 seconds. Just to fly up? Can I ride

00:38:23.585 --> 00:38:25.513
side-saddle with you?

00:38:25.513 --> 00:38:29.607
LAURA: Of course you can, yes! Put your arms
around me, Keyleth.

00:38:29.607 --> 00:38:33.823
MARISHA: Okay! Your abs are nice, Vex!

00:38:33.823 --> 00:38:35.330
LAURA: I know, I work out a lot.

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:37.641
MARISHA: Have you been working out over the past
year? Wow.

00:38:37.641 --> 00:38:41.990
MATT: So, who's helming the investigation of this?
And you're aiding her, so go ahead and take it

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:43.713
with advantage.

00:38:43.713 --> 00:38:49.116
LAURA: Same thing. 21.

00:38:49.116 --> 00:38:56.399
MATT: All righty. I left on my collapsing music.

00:38:56.399 --> 00:38:59.542
TRAVIS: They die.

00:38:59.542 --> 00:39:04.748
MATT: So, as you glance around and do a pass over
the next 20 minutes or so. It's as fast as you

00:39:04.748 --> 00:39:09.146
can, but it takes you a while to scan and get a
feel for it. You do see what looks to be, because

00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:15.930
you felt the wind was coming through from the
interior, you see a small well-like crevasse where

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:23.189
the rocks have collapsed inward. You can see,
glancing over the top, the dark, five,

00:39:23.189 --> 00:39:26.334
six-foot-wide hole that leads deeper into the
mountain.

00:39:26.334 --> 00:39:28.920
LAURA: I hover down near it, but don't get off the
broom.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:35.890
MARISHA: I lean over, I Druidcraft a pebble, toss
it in the hole.

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:41.228
MATT: Don't hear it.

00:39:41.228 --> 00:39:43.802
LAURA: Oracle arrow down the hole.

00:39:43.802 --> 00:39:47.238
MATT: Okay! Your vision watches as it--

00:39:47.238 --> 00:39:50.436
LAURA: Oh, wait! Can she set the end of it on
fire?

00:39:50.436 --> 00:39:51.514
MARISHA: Yeah!

00:39:51.514 --> 00:39:58.011
MATT: Okay, the arrow now, burning, it leads you
into this dark space. It lights up the interior.

00:39:58.011 --> 00:40:02.646
The arrow gets about maybe 60 feet before it hits
a rock and shatters.

00:40:02.646 --> 00:40:03.968
LAURA: Aww.

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:08.516
MATT: It's not straight down. It has a series of
platforms, and it looks like it was designed to be

00:40:08.516 --> 00:40:14.927
climbed down, so it's a bit zig-zaggy. It maybe
went 50, 60 feet and it hits a platform and

00:40:14.927 --> 00:40:20.394
shatters. You lose your vision. But it does appear
to be a sizable tunnel used for entry.

00:40:20.394 --> 00:40:22.595
LAURA: Let's just fucking collapse it.

00:40:22.595 --> 00:40:23.510
MARISHA: All right!

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:28.077
LAURA: Well, just you fucking collapse because I
can't do shit to this thing.

00:40:28.077 --> 00:40:34.943
MARISHA: Can I be like, all right! I want to see
if I can do this, like, cool maneuver. I'm going

00:40:34.943 --> 00:40:41.708
to try to balance on the broom, and then jump off
the broom and go Keyteor and go into the--

00:40:41.708 --> 00:40:44.432
LAURA: Into it, &lt;i&gt;into&lt;/i&gt; it?! Or just around it so
you collapse the--

00:40:44.432 --> 00:40:45.595
MARISHA: Nah!

00:40:45.595 --> 00:40:48.702
LAURA: Oh, god, Keyleth!

00:40:48.702 --> 00:40:55.459
MATT: You watch as she leaps and-- cloud of dust.
There is no sign she impacted, she's just gone.

00:40:55.459 --> 00:40:57.026
You just see the side of the mountain.

00:40:57.026 --> 00:41:02.332
LAURA: Fuck! Fuck! I get out the rope of
entanglement and hover close to the surface and

00:41:02.332 --> 00:41:04.301
start hanging the rope down.

00:41:04.301 --> 00:41:09.317
MATT: You glance in the inside with what little
bit of daylight is ricocheting off of the stone

00:41:09.317 --> 00:41:16.393
interior. You can see the edges of Keyleth's
elemental form swimming through the rock. Because

00:41:16.393 --> 00:41:17.710
she can do that.

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:20.129
LAURA: That's fucking crazy.

00:41:20.129 --> 00:41:21.498
MARISHA: It's like Whac-A-Mole!

00:41:21.498 --> 00:41:24.336
LAURA: Careful of traps, though, Keyleth, because
I'm sure there's something in there.

00:41:24.336 --> 00:41:25.327
MARISHA: All right.

00:41:25.327 --> 00:41:27.803
TALIESIN: How's it going down there? Have you
found it yet?

00:41:27.803 --> 00:41:29.178
LAURA: Up here?

00:41:29.178 --> 00:41:30.133
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:41:30.133 --> 00:41:32.935
LAURA: Fabulous. Our friend, Keyleth, is amazing.

00:41:32.935 --> 00:41:34.210
TALIESIN: She jumped in, didn't she?

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:35.260
LAURA: Yes, she did.

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:41.630
MARISHA: I'm going to Earth Glide to the bottom
and then peek my earthy face out of the top, see

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:42.932
if I can see down.

00:41:42.932 --> 00:41:45.484
MATT: Are you following the actual path?

00:41:45.484 --> 00:41:51.358
MARISHA: Yeah. I'll try to be conscious to make
sure I don't hit anything that looks precarious.

00:41:51.358 --> 00:41:54.690
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:57.843
LAURA: Don't hit any traps!

00:41:57.843 --> 00:42:05.633
MARISHA: All right! Looking for traps! That's
okay, 15.

00:42:05.633 --> 00:42:12.137
MATT: 15. Okay. You get about a third of the way
down, and you realize that one of the platforms

00:42:12.137 --> 00:42:19.713
that you can land on has, uncharacteristically, a
softer cushion to it. Everything else is just

00:42:19.713 --> 00:42:21.583
stone slabs. This one has almost--

00:42:21.583 --> 00:42:23.062
SAM: Waterbed.

00:42:23.062 --> 00:42:33.913
MATT: Yeah! (laughs) Like a spring air mattress,
it's crazy. No, it's like a woven, dried palm

00:42:33.913 --> 00:42:36.393
frond-like cloth that's rested over it.

00:42:36.393 --> 00:42:43.032
SAM: I'm sure it's nothing. Probably nothing. Just
leave it.

00:42:43.032 --> 00:42:49.980
MARISHA: Just a drop-through? Can I, like-- fuck.

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:53.442
LAURA: Don't fuck with anything, Keyleth. Just
collapse it!

00:42:53.442 --> 00:42:56.526
MARISHA: I found, like a, it might be a roof or--

00:42:56.526 --> 00:42:58.479
TRAVIS: Yeah, I bet Clarota's in there.

00:42:58.479 --> 00:43:04.916
MARISHA: What? Piranhas? I don't know if piranhas
are in rocks, but there might be something else in

00:43:04.916 --> 00:43:08.739
there. There might be piranhas. Oh, I'll avoid
it.

00:43:08.739 --> 00:43:16.824
MATT: Okay. You continue southward, scooting. You
can sense the very exterior of the wall that leads

00:43:16.824 --> 00:43:21.431
to this path, so you're staying away from it as
you glide through the rock and earth. Eventually,

00:43:21.431 --> 00:43:27.504
you come close to the very top, breaching the dome
that leads down into the chamber where you had

00:43:27.504 --> 00:43:32.207
your battle naught but an hour ago. As you poke
your face through, you're looking down, you can

00:43:32.207 --> 00:43:39.330
see the dark sphere there, hovering. You can see
the large pyramid structure below it, probably

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:47.127
about 60 feet below you. You can see the entrance
to the tunnel that leads into here. There is a

00:43:47.127 --> 00:43:54.425
small ladder up along the wall that previously you
didn't notice because of the lack of light and

00:43:54.425 --> 00:43:58.158
attention to the ceiling portion. But people were
either climbing up into or climbing down from.

00:43:58.158 --> 00:43:59.715
LAURA: What do you see, Keyleth?

00:43:59.715 --> 00:44:03.418
MARISHA: There's a ladder, man, there's some very
innovative people.

00:44:03.418 --> 00:44:05.702
Yeah, these are very innovative cultists.

00:44:05.702 --> 00:44:10.289
LAURA: Wait, you're looking down at the ziggurat?

00:44:10.289 --> 00:44:13.685
MARISHA: Yeah! Hey, Pike and Grog, you guys did an
excellent job.

00:44:13.685 --> 00:44:15.125
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: Oh thanks!

00:44:15.125 --> 00:44:16.519
TRAVIS: It really means a lot.

00:44:16.519 --> 00:44:17.909
LAURA: Get the fuck away from it, Keyleth!

00:44:17.909 --> 00:44:19.044
MARISHA: Okay! Good idea!

00:44:19.044 --> 00:44:23.094
MATT: By the way, it's fantastic. You all hear
through it (earth elemental grumbling).

00:44:23.094 --> 00:44:24.326
TRAVIS: Oh, right, yeah!

00:44:24.326 --> 00:44:27.650
MATT: The grumbling, low voice of an earth
elemental speaking to you through the earring.

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:29.668
LAURA: We still don't know how far that field
goes.

00:44:29.668 --> 00:44:31.914
If you turn into Keyleth again, you're fucked!

00:44:31.914 --> 00:44:33.460
MARISHA: (unintelligible grumbling)

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:34.871
LAURA: Get the fuck out!

00:44:34.871 --> 00:44:38.952
MARISHA: I try and say, like, well, I know it's
about 180 feet because I tested before, so I'm

00:44:38.952 --> 00:44:43.784
trying to be conscious of it. And then I back up a
little bit, and I go over to where that tunnel

00:44:43.784 --> 00:44:50.652
was, and I start collapsing it down. As I work my
way up, I'm going (impacts).

00:44:50.652 --> 00:44:57.496
MATT: Easily enough. You go by and you start
kicking through the tunnel as you go. You can

00:44:57.496 --> 00:45:04.384
sense near proximity where any of the various weak
points are in the stone. Systematically go through

00:45:04.384 --> 00:45:08.850
it, collapse it, piece by piece, until eventually
most of the tunnel is useless and unusable.

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:10.343
MARISHA: It's like a platformer.

00:45:10.343 --> 00:45:14.363
MATT: How long can you maintain your wild shape?

00:45:14.363 --> 00:45:18.965
MARISHA: Half of my level, or something like
that?

00:45:18.965 --> 00:45:20.244
MATT: Oh, you're fine, then.

00:45:20.244 --> 00:45:24.646
MARISHA: Or it's a third of my level? Still
several hours.

00:45:24.646 --> 00:45:29.861
MATT: You emerge a little over an hour or so of
doing this. You emerge from the top. You watch as

00:45:29.861 --> 00:45:34.128
Keyleth (rock impacts), looking like a large
version of Fantastic Four's Thing.

00:45:34.128 --> 00:45:37.641
LAURA: I'm holding my rope for her. You don't--
okay.

00:45:37.641 --> 00:45:46.401
MATT: It appears to be taken care of. All of the
entrances have been collapsed. There's no way that

00:45:46.401 --> 00:45:50.426
you can imagine any average person can find their
way into this.

00:45:50.426 --> 00:45:56.411
LAURA: Good job. Are you going to stay that way,
or are you turning back into you so that I can get

00:45:56.411 --> 00:45:58.247
you on the broom?

00:45:58.247 --> 00:45:59.903
MARISHA: (guttural noise of agreement)

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:02.785
(laughter)

00:46:02.785 --> 00:46:05.338
LAURA: You can still talk, right? You just sound
low.

00:46:05.338 --> 00:46:06.543
TRAVIS: No.

00:46:06.543 --> 00:46:12.316
MARISHA: (guttural gibberish) I speak a different
language that I still don't think anyone has--

00:46:12.316 --> 00:46:19.033
MATT: You can-- you maintain your mental acuity
and statistics when you're in there.

00:46:19.033 --> 00:46:22.252
MARISHA: I don't know. We've gone back and forth
on it!

00:46:22.252 --> 00:46:26.622
TALIESIN: It never occurred to you to speak
Common. Why would I do that?

00:46:26.622 --> 00:46:36.075
MATT: The texture and timbre of your voice. You
can hear words, but it's almost like words being

00:46:36.075 --> 00:46:38.120
made by slamming rocks together.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.216
LAURA: Crazy.

00:46:39.216 --> 00:46:40.958
MARISHA: Not that different from my normal
speech.

00:46:40.958 --> 00:46:48.330
LIAM: I won't bore you with the details, but while
all that was going on, while they were searching

00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:53.556
and they were destroying things, Vax wandered a
hundred feet out and sat down and did a little

00:46:53.556 --> 00:46:58.532
talking to the mother of ravens, and basically
said, not expecting an answer:

00:46:58.532 --> 00:47:01.534
This is it, isn't it?

00:47:01.534 --> 00:47:05.522
MATT: Make a wisdom check.

00:47:05.522 --> 00:47:12.766
ALL: Ooh.

00:47:12.766 --> 00:47:14.631
LIAM: Not good. 13.

00:47:14.631 --> 00:47:21.407
MATT: 13? That's enough. As you sit there in
silence with your eyes closed, beseeching the

00:47:21.407 --> 00:47:29.162
attention of your patron, which seemingly wasn't
present when you attempted to in the proximity of

00:47:29.162 --> 00:47:43.039
this doorway. The familiar soft, omnipresent voice
creeps into your psyche as she tells you, "It

00:47:43.039 --> 00:47:58.102
"seems that the bender of fate is feeling the tug
of destiny. It's almost as if you're coming

00:47:58.102 --> 00:48:09.930
"towards me. If you sense this path is the right
one, follow your instincts.

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:14.378
"Perhaps we'll meet soon enough."

00:48:14.378 --> 00:48:19.152
LIAM: I will see you soon.

00:48:19.152 --> 00:48:29.875
MATT: All right. So you guys reconvene.

00:48:29.875 --> 00:48:34.918
LAURA: Hey, guys. How's it going?

00:48:34.918 --> 00:48:37.411
LIAM: Hey, guys!

00:48:37.411 --> 00:48:40.195
LAURA: What should we do?

00:48:40.195 --> 00:48:42.724
TRAVIS: You should try the local fruit. It's
delicious.

00:48:42.724 --> 00:48:44.351
ASHLEY: Yeah, you guys should try it.

00:48:44.351 --> 00:48:47.411
TALIESIN: I pick up a piece of the local fruit and
smell it.

00:48:47.411 --> 00:49:07.326
MATT: How do I describe the smell? It's
reminiscent of discovering old lemon juice that

00:49:07.326 --> 00:49:15.034
has grown sticky on a surface, like a dark
mahogany wood surface. Kind of like a bar floor.

00:49:15.034 --> 00:49:17.320
We'll go with that.

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.749
TALIESIN: No, I don't think I will.

00:49:19.749 --> 00:49:21.855
TRAVIS: It belies its true flavor.

00:49:21.855 --> 00:49:23.656
TALIESIN: I don't think it does.

00:49:23.656 --> 00:49:29.555
MARISHA: This looks like it's rotten from the
landscape. It looks like it's all gone bad.

00:49:29.555 --> 00:49:30.917
Has it gone bad?

00:49:30.917 --> 00:49:32.912
MATT: Make a nature check.

00:49:32.912 --> 00:49:34.761
TRAVIS: Oh, great.

00:49:34.761 --> 00:49:38.709
MARISHA: 25.

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:45.328
MATT: No. There are elements that have gone bad on
the ground and have been covered by sand

00:49:45.328 --> 00:49:47.422
as winds blow through.

00:49:47.422 --> 00:49:49.288
TALIESIN: Naturally awful.

00:49:49.288 --> 00:49:56.895
MATT: It's like desert noni. It's extremely
healthy and has a lot of practical medicinal use.

00:49:56.895 --> 00:50:04.408
In fact, it's traded specifically for its use in
various herb pouches.

00:50:04.408 --> 00:50:08.214
MARISHA: Does it have a name?

00:50:08.214 --> 00:50:10.106
MATT: Yes.

00:50:10.106 --> 00:50:13.945
LIAM: Like that giant, stinking flower. Grog took
a bite of the giant, stinking flower.

00:50:13.945 --> 00:50:16.370
MATT: A vafall fruit.

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:20.853
MARISHA: A what?

00:50:20.853 --> 00:50:23.436
TALIESIN: Did it alter Grog's stats on any level?

00:50:23.436 --> 00:50:24.470
MATT: No.

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:26.888
TALIESIN: Then it's not that healthy, is it? It's
like agave.

00:50:26.888 --> 00:50:28.995
MARISHA: Vafall?

00:50:28.995 --> 00:50:31.150
MATT: Listen to Sam. He's got the pronunciation.

00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:33.236
LIAM: I will eat you with a lovely chianti and
some vafall.

00:50:33.236 --> 00:50:35.778
ALL: Vafall.

00:50:35.778 --> 00:50:37.269
ASHLEY: Should we take some, then?

00:50:37.269 --> 00:50:39.800
LAURA: Make some medicine?

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.852
TALIESIN: You could try to bake with it. Maybe
it's bakeable.

00:50:42.852 --> 00:50:47.224
MARISHA: It makes a really good salve. It's good
for sunburns.

00:50:47.224 --> 00:50:49.144
LIAM: Or shoving in somebody's bed.

00:50:49.144 --> 00:50:52.479
TRAVIS: How do we get back to Whitestone?

00:50:52.479 --> 00:50:56.885
TALIESIN: Is there a tree that this fruit was
coming off of?

00:50:56.885 --> 00:50:57.843
MATT: Yes.

00:50:57.843 --> 00:51:00.167
TALIESIN: I point at the tree.

00:51:00.167 --> 00:51:06.406
MATT: The ones on the outskirts of the mountain
range are small, but the deeper into the valleys

00:51:06.406 --> 00:51:10.431
and ravines between the large spire-like
mountains, you do find a few that are probably

00:51:10.431 --> 00:51:12.301
large enough to utilize through your spell.

00:51:12.301 --> 00:51:13.486
MARISHA: Yeah, I can do that.

00:51:13.486 --> 00:51:15.015
LAURA: Tary, are you coming back to Whitestone?

00:51:15.015 --> 00:51:21.942
SAM: I have to, yes. I have to repair Doty, and
also find some new recruits. I think there are

00:51:21.942 --> 00:51:23.366
some in Whitestone, right?

00:51:23.366 --> 00:51:24.854
TALIESIN: You're really going through with this?

00:51:24.854 --> 00:51:30.547
SAM: Of course. It's my destiny. I met you all to
become an adventurer, and now I'm bringing my

00:51:30.547 --> 00:51:34.833
knowledge back to my people. It's like it was
written in a book.

00:51:34.833 --> 00:51:37.982
LAURA: A very good book.

00:51:37.982 --> 00:51:39.387
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're writing a book!

00:51:39.387 --> 00:51:41.524
SAM: I am.

00:51:41.524 --> 00:51:46.107
ASHLEY: And not only that, you're going to be the
leader of a band of adventurers.

00:51:46.107 --> 00:51:48.861
TRAVIS: Are you a colonel, a general, a private?

00:51:48.861 --> 00:51:54.782
SAM: I hadn't thought of that. You know what?
There's no leader of Vox Machina, so maybe there

00:51:54.782 --> 00:52:00.517
won't be in the Darrington Brigade. Well, besides
you. You're unofficially--

00:52:00.517 --> 00:52:02.488
you're definitely the treasurer.

00:52:02.488 --> 00:52:06.209
LIAM: I'm behind her doing this.

00:52:06.209 --> 00:52:07.889
TRAVIS: Yeah, rolling eyes.

00:52:07.889 --> 00:52:10.658
LAURA: Lionel?

00:52:10.658 --> 00:52:13.697
MATT: His mouth is filled with fruit.

00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:17.391
(laughter)

00:52:17.391 --> 00:52:19.252
LAURA: Is it good? How are you doing?

00:52:19.252 --> 00:52:23.077
MATT: "It's getting really heavy. This is really
heavy."

00:52:23.077 --> 00:52:31.113
LAURA: Yeah. Are you coming back to Whitestone, as
well? Scanlan, I mean Aes-- is he coming back?

00:52:31.113 --> 00:52:33.647
SAM: I suppose we'll need him for now, yes.

00:52:33.647 --> 00:52:34.808
LAURA: Okay.

00:52:34.808 --> 00:52:39.936
TALIESIN: I still like the idea of perhaps the two
of you working together. You could talk to Scanlan

00:52:39.936 --> 00:52:42.035
about it and see if he'd be all right--

00:52:42.035 --> 00:52:43.875
(laughter)

00:52:43.875 --> 00:52:46.213
TALIESIN: I'm never going to get bored of this.
I'm never going to get bored of this!

00:52:46.213 --> 00:52:48.190
LIAM: Scanlan, what do you think?

00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:53.920
TRAVIS: That was a fucking awesome
physical reaction.

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.646
LIAM: At least in the short term.

00:52:55.646 --> 00:53:04.077
SAM: You're suggesting that I, Scanlan Shorthalt,
bequeath my employee Chod to this gentleman here?

00:53:04.077 --> 00:53:10.697
You mean me, Taryon Darrington? You mean Chod
could join my brigade?

00:53:10.697 --> 00:53:13.067
Well, yes. I guess that's what they're talking
about.

00:53:13.067 --> 00:53:16.157
Well, I don't see why not. He's very capable and
strong.

00:53:16.157 --> 00:53:20.729
Yes, and I won't have much use for him for a
while, so if you'd like to take him with your

00:53:20.729 --> 00:53:21.930
brigade, you can.

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:27.944
Well, I'm not going to say no to a fellow member
of Vox Machina now, am I?

00:53:27.944 --> 00:53:29.076
No, you're not.

00:53:29.076 --> 00:53:30.576
No, I'm not.

00:53:30.576 --> 00:53:31.938
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:53:31.938 --> 00:53:38.397
MATT: "I don't see any similarities."

00:53:38.397 --> 00:53:40.592
(laughter)

00:53:40.592 --> 00:53:44.771
TALIESIN: That's everything I wanted. I'm good.

00:53:44.771 --> 00:53:45.898
LAURA: Through the tree, then?

00:53:45.898 --> 00:53:46.860
MARISHA: Through the tree.

00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:54.926
MATT: All right, so as you finish concentrating on
the outside of one of these large, 15 to

00:53:54.926 --> 00:53:59.773
20-foot-tall, leafless, fruit-bearing trees in the
center of the Smoldercrown Forest, the doorway

00:53:59.773 --> 00:54:06.293
shifts open, revealing on the opposite side the
dark, sunless night of Whitestone.

00:54:06.293 --> 00:54:11.245
MARISHA: I pick a blossom from the tree on the way
out.

00:54:11.245 --> 00:54:12.682
LIAM: I pull two of the fruits.

00:54:12.682 --> 00:54:26.063
MATT: Okay. You guys arrive. It's early evening.
You can see the windows of nearby homes, shops,

00:54:26.063 --> 00:54:31.950
and various structures near the square are
beginning to glow from the interior light of small

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:37.661
lanterns and candles. In the distance, you can see
the perimeter beacons being put along the castle

00:54:37.661 --> 00:54:43.601
walls on the exterior of Castle Whitestone. You're
back home.

00:54:43.601 --> 00:54:46.293
LAURA: Let's gather our troops.

00:54:46.293 --> 00:54:47.734
TALIESIN: Make thy way to the castle.

00:54:47.734 --> 00:54:49.054
LAURA: Find out what they've learned.

00:54:49.054 --> 00:54:56.087
MATT: All right. At which point, Lionel keeps
asking,

00:54:56.087 --> 00:54:59.774
"Can I put him down yet? Can I put him down?"

00:54:59.774 --> 00:55:01.069
SAM: Not quite yet.

00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:02.641
TALIESIN: We're going to take him to the castle.

00:55:02.641 --> 00:55:04.909
SAM: Change arms.

00:55:04.909 --> 00:55:15.959
MATT: "Ooh! That helps a lot." You make your way
to the castle.

00:55:15.959 --> 00:55:21.409
Doty's delivered to the workshop. Taryon?

00:55:21.409 --> 00:55:22.794
SAM: Stays there.

00:55:22.794 --> 00:55:23.756
MATT: Okay.

00:55:23.756 --> 00:55:26.350
(laughter)

00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:29.448
TALIESIN: We'll keep you informed.

00:55:29.448 --> 00:55:30.989
SAM: Thank you.

00:55:30.989 --> 00:55:36.358
MATT: All right, so you guys now have the run of
the castle. What do you wish to do?

00:55:36.358 --> 00:55:42.512
LAURA: We asked Cassandra to gather people to
study the Shadowfell as soon as we did the oracle

00:55:42.512 --> 00:55:46.262
arrow last time, so it would probably be smart to
find out what

00:55:46.262 --> 00:55:48.819
they've learned before we make our plans.

00:55:48.819 --> 00:55:56.701
MATT: Okay. As you approach Cassandra, at this
hour, she currently has a recently steeped,

00:55:56.701 --> 00:56:03.296
still-steaming cup of tea resting on the table,
towards the window side, the front window side, of

00:56:03.296 --> 00:56:09.804
the general dining hall area of the castle where
you usually eat your supper. She's facing away

00:56:09.804 --> 00:56:13.842
from the table and has a thick robe over her and
has the tea and is in the process of reading

00:56:13.842 --> 00:56:18.306
through books. Her hair's pulled up tightly, and
some of it's a mess in front of her face. She's

00:56:18.306 --> 00:56:22.858
very much in work mode. She's poring through
books, and as soon as you enter, she reaches over

00:56:22.858 --> 00:56:35.752
for her cup of tea. "Oh. Hello, everyone." She
gets herself a little more presentable. "I've got

00:56:35.752 --> 00:56:43.295
"the assistance of Eskil Ryndarien. Everyone else
seems to be a bit busy at the moment, but Allura

00:56:43.295 --> 00:56:45.629
"is doing the best she can research on her end, as
well."

00:56:45.629 --> 00:56:49.033
TALIESIN: We're going to need everybody. It's
worse than we could have imagined.

00:56:49.033 --> 00:56:52.137
LAURA: And we have far less time than we would
have imagined.

00:56:52.137 --> 00:56:54.219
MATT: "How much time do we have?"

00:56:54.219 --> 00:56:57.695
TALIESIN: This has to be taken care of
immediately.

00:56:57.695 --> 00:56:59.541
LIAM: Things are happening now.

00:56:59.541 --> 00:57:05.763
MATT: "Well, you have far better means of
acquiring these people than I do. I can merely

00:57:05.763 --> 00:57:07.381
"send missives and requests."

00:57:07.381 --> 00:57:13.850
TALIESIN: We're going to send word out. I'm going
to take out my flask and put it on the table. Sit

00:57:13.850 --> 00:57:15.524
down for a moment.

00:57:15.524 --> 00:57:17.772
MATT: She takes it and adds it to her tea.

00:57:17.772 --> 00:57:19.393
LAURA: Is Ryndarien here?

00:57:19.393 --> 00:57:26.078
MATT: "He is. He's currently inspecting the
ziggurat again. He's setting his notes up where he

00:57:26.078 --> 00:57:31.286
"previously set up research quarters during the
incursion of the Conclave."

00:57:31.286 --> 00:57:33.158
LAURA: We need to get everyone away from it.

00:57:33.158 --> 00:57:34.619
MARISHA: Where's Allura?

00:57:34.619 --> 00:57:37.440
MATT: "She's in Emon. She's still part of the
council there."

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.492
TALIESIN: We have to get her here immediately.

00:57:39.492 --> 00:57:41.395
LIAM: Is Gilmore still in town?

00:57:41.395 --> 00:57:43.272
MATT: "No, he's back in Emon."

00:57:43.272 --> 00:57:44.508
LIAM: He left for good?

00:57:44.508 --> 00:57:49.041
LAURA: I'm going to run down to the ziggurat and
try to get Eskil Ryndarien away from it and warn

00:57:49.041 --> 00:57:51.060
everyone to stay away from it.

00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:52.024
MATT: Okay.

00:57:52.024 --> 00:57:58.546
TALIESIN: Let's double-check that armor for any
weird influences it may have, to make sure it is what

00:57:58.546 --> 00:58:04.450
it seems to be, which is ornamental, with a bit of
magic. Let's make sure that the captain of

00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:09.758
whatever guard is on shift down by the ziggurat is
wearing it, and is aware that he's there to

00:58:09.758 --> 00:58:11.487
befuddle the enemy.

00:58:11.487 --> 00:58:16.197
MATT: Okay. You make your way down there, and you
can see it's still fairly dark in that chamber.

00:58:16.197 --> 00:58:20.347
Most of the lights have been snuffed except for a
few torches that are set around the central

00:58:20.347 --> 00:58:24.863
platform that was built about mid-height on the
ziggurat, where you guys had the council meeting

00:58:24.863 --> 00:58:28.618
with Raishan that one time, and where most of the
research is being done there. Up top, you see a

00:58:28.618 --> 00:58:34.084
number of guards, the Pale Guard are assigned to
keep watch. You see Jecht, the manservant of the

00:58:34.084 --> 00:58:43.142
Realmseer Eskil there, as well. Currently, you see
Eskil Ryndarien is spreading out his thick scrolls

00:58:43.142 --> 00:58:47.954
and books, and they're all across the big central
wooden table, and he has his thick spectacles on,

00:58:47.954 --> 00:58:53.670
and he has a number of candles already set up, and
he's deep into getting his space prepped and

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:57.926
acquiring whatever information he'd put away since
the investigation was put on hold.

00:58:57.926 --> 00:58:59.080
LAURA: Eskil?

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:06.398
MATT: "Yes? Oh, it has been some time, Lady
Vex'ahlia.

00:59:06.398 --> 00:59:09.153
"I've heard you've come up in the world."

00:59:09.153 --> 00:59:11.526
LAURA: Oh, yes. I'm a lady now.

00:59:11.526 --> 00:59:15.459
MATT: "Wondrous. Yes. What do I have the honor?"

00:59:15.459 --> 00:59:19.554
LAURA: Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but I'm afraid

00:59:19.554 --> 00:59:22.909
being down here isn't safe anymore.

00:59:22.909 --> 00:59:25.896
MATT: "Right, so you brought me all the way out
here, and now I can't do my work? That's great.

00:59:25.896 --> 00:59:29.226
"No, that's par for the course. It's basically most
of my life."

00:59:29.226 --> 00:59:37.264
LAURA: Plenty of work up top, away from this orb
of death. It's very dangerous.

00:59:37.264 --> 00:59:41.401
MATT: "Oh! You're right. I didn't know that. I've
only spent six months with the thing!"

00:59:41.401 --> 00:59:47.352
LAURA: We've discovered it's a gateway, and things
can come through it, and there might be armies

00:59:47.352 --> 00:59:51.475
coming through because we just fought somebody on
the other side of another ziggurat.

00:59:51.475 --> 00:59:56.514
MATT: "That's preposterous. Siphons only work one
way, my dear. Nothing's coming through there."

00:59:56.514 --> 01:00:00.296
LAURA: She changed it. Did you know that siphons
can be changed?

01:00:00.296 --> 01:00:02.772
It changed from one color to another.

01:00:02.772 --> 01:00:04.233
MATT: "You know this how?"

01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:06.092
LAURA: Because I was there to witness it.

01:00:06.092 --> 01:00:07.997
MATT: "What, here?"

01:00:07.997 --> 01:00:13.271
LAURA: In Ank'harel. And it looks the exact same
as this one.

01:00:13.271 --> 01:00:27.941
MATT: He looks you over really intensely. "If what
you believe you saw is indeed another one of these

01:00:27.941 --> 01:00:35.347
"siphons, then perhaps we should take a little more
care."

01:00:35.347 --> 01:00:37.476
LAURA: I agree.

01:00:37.476 --> 01:00:42.634
MATT: "Jecht, please continue. Gather everything.
We're taking this outside."

01:00:42.634 --> 01:00:48.415
LAURA: Fabulous. You're so agreeable. I do love
talking to you.

01:00:48.415 --> 01:00:56.740
MATT: "Wonderful. Good to know. Goodbye." They
gather up the materials. The Pale Guard escorts

01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:00.910
them back into the hallway, and he's now talking
to Jecht off on the side. He goes, "Well, then we

01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:06.970
"can go ahead and stage ourselves in the grand
guestroom with the nice big bed. Yes?"

01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:09.057
LAURA: The big ornate bed.

01:01:09.057 --> 01:01:14.234
MATT: He looks over his shoulder as you say this.
"Oh, you're eavesdropping now, as well.

01:01:14.234 --> 01:01:15.425
"That's wondrous."

01:01:15.425 --> 01:01:16.735
LAURA: I have wonderful hearing.

01:01:16.735 --> 01:01:21.062
MATT: "So I can tell. Yes, the big bed. The one
that helps with my back."

01:01:21.062 --> 01:01:26.689
LAURA: Yes, that's terrible. Can you look at this
armor really fast and make sure that it's not

01:01:26.689 --> 01:01:28.772
actually cursed or anything?

01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:31.592
MATT: "Looks fine to me!" Keeps walking.

01:01:31.592 --> 01:01:36.897
LAURA: Was it cursed, or anything, when you looked
at it?

01:01:36.897 --> 01:01:38.230
SAM: I don't know.

01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:40.331
MATT: Did not appear to be cursed from your glance
at it.

01:01:40.331 --> 01:01:48.052
LAURA: Would he have known from the Identify spell
if it was cursed? Great. Well.

01:01:48.052 --> 01:01:50.305
MARISHA: Can Keyleth go talk to Percy?

01:01:50.305 --> 01:01:52.572
TALIESIN: I'm in Cassandra's room, still.

01:01:52.572 --> 01:02:00.179
MARISHA: Keyleth waits for Percy. Hang on. I can
go talk with Cassandra, as well.

01:02:00.179 --> 01:02:03.282
MATT: Unless you're having a closed conversation.

01:02:03.282 --> 01:02:11.636
TALIESIN: Just ten seconds of it. We'll see how
this goes. Have a bit of that flask.

01:02:11.636 --> 01:02:15.810
MATT: She's already poured some into her tea.

01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:24.616
TALIESIN: We've found a second ziggurat. We found
a cult that is moving things through it. The cult

01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:33.968
was being led by Delilah Briarwood.

01:02:33.968 --> 01:02:45.517
MATT: The silence, the stark absence of sound, is
completely sundered by the sound of shattering

01:02:45.517 --> 01:02:56.271
porcelainware. The tea that she had recently
barely sipped on is now shattered and spilled

01:02:56.271 --> 01:03:03.801
across the ground. She stands there, her hand open
as it slowly curls back. She stares off into the

01:03:03.801 --> 01:03:06.777
distance, clenching her fist very tightly.

01:03:06.777 --> 01:03:12.438
TALIESIN: She escaped into the ziggurat, so she's
no longer on this plane of existence, but some

01:03:12.438 --> 01:03:18.869
form of her, whether it's undead or otherwise,
we're going to need to put it down again.

01:03:18.869 --> 01:03:21.950
MATT: "Yes, we do."

01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:28.037
TALIESIN: I wanted you to hear it from me. There
will be no running this time.

01:03:28.037 --> 01:03:30.055
MATT: "No running."

01:03:30.055 --> 01:03:31.686
TALIESIN: Not from me.

01:03:31.686 --> 01:03:35.645
MATT: "But you'll take care of her?"

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:40.373
TALIESIN: This is the end of her. I will be there
to see it.

01:03:40.373 --> 01:03:46.052
MATT: "She's escaped death once already. Who knows
how many times she has before.

01:03:46.052 --> 01:03:48.773
"You have to end it."

01:03:48.773 --> 01:03:53.337
TALIESIN: We will discover what she did.

01:03:53.337 --> 01:03:59.230
MATT: "Don't destroy her body. Destroy everything
she is."

01:03:59.230 --> 01:04:03.346
TALIESIN: If we can't kill her, we will entrap her
forever.

01:04:03.346 --> 01:04:09.188
MATT: "Shatter the soul. Whatever it takes. End
her, brother."

01:04:09.188 --> 01:04:12.593
TALIESIN: I know. I shall.

01:04:12.593 --> 01:04:18.215
MATT: She takes the flask.

01:04:18.215 --> 01:04:26.887
TALIESIN: I wanted you to hear it from me so you
could compose yourself when

01:04:26.887 --> 01:04:29.153
other people begin to tell you.

01:04:29.153 --> 01:04:35.728
MATT: "I need a moment alone, please."

01:04:35.728 --> 01:04:43.169
TALIESIN: They're going to need us to be the
strongest. I have faith in you. I'll leave you to

01:04:43.169 --> 01:04:44.771
it. I'm so sorry.

01:04:44.771 --> 01:04:46.488
MATT: "I'm going to be sick."

01:04:46.488 --> 01:04:50.091
TALIESIN: Yes. I'm going to leave her to her room
and shut the door.

01:04:50.091 --> 01:04:52.964
MATT: You close the door and there in the hallway,
waiting opposite the door, is Keyleth.

01:04:52.964 --> 01:04:54.865
TALIESIN: Hi.

01:04:54.865 --> 01:04:57.352
MARISHA: How did that go?

01:04:57.352 --> 01:05:00.384
TALIESIN: Honestly, better than I expected.

01:05:00.384 --> 01:05:01.399
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:05:01.399 --> 01:05:06.223
MATT: At which point, you hear behind the door, a
muffled (retching).

01:05:06.223 --> 01:05:13.083
TALIESIN: More sick and less things breaking. I'd
rather her be sick than angry.

01:05:13.083 --> 01:05:20.143
MARISHA: You think? I hate being sick. Anger at
least drives you towards something.

01:05:20.143 --> 01:05:23.037
TALIESIN: It does not drive de Rolos towards
anything good.

01:05:23.037 --> 01:05:31.814
MARISHA: Fair point. I have a crazy thought, and I
needed to run by you. Sorry, didn't mean to hit

01:05:31.814 --> 01:05:41.200
you. Okay. I'm excited. All right. We watched the
orb change. She changed the magic in the orb,

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:50.306
right? We just spent a year making magical orbs
that change in some way, that are all linked to

01:05:50.306 --> 01:05:56.197
our city. Clearly, not as powerful as what this
is.

01:05:56.197 --> 01:05:58.243
TALIESIN: No, not at all.

01:05:58.243 --> 01:06:07.200
MARISHA: But what if-- I don't know. What if she
corrupted something that was already there that

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:18.216
wasn't supposed to be corrupted? What if she can
corrupt more things, like our crisis orbs? I had

01:06:18.216 --> 01:06:22.179
this immediate fear that what if I built something
that was supposed to help--

01:06:22.179 --> 01:06:26.793
TALIESIN: I'm so glad you thought of me when this
came up.

01:06:26.793 --> 01:06:31.949
MARISHA: Well, you helped me build it. Am I crazy
for thinking it? Am I totally off base?

01:06:31.949 --> 01:06:36.245
TALIESIN: I think we're going to be walking a very
fine line of paranoia for the next

01:06:36.245 --> 01:06:38.999
however long.

01:06:38.999 --> 01:06:45.089
MARISHA: Maybe there's something in our own
technology, in our own magic, that can help inform

01:06:45.089 --> 01:06:47.060
us. I don't know.

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:49.034
TALIESIN: When they get here, we're going to look
at everything.

01:06:49.034 --> 01:06:50.700
MARISHA: All right. We'll sleep on it.

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:55.337
TALIESIN: I think we're going to be fine, but you
did give me some ideas that

01:06:55.337 --> 01:06:56.771
I'm going to think about.

01:06:56.771 --> 01:07:05.712
MARISHA: And those symbols. The necklaces. Druids,
we use similar things

01:07:05.712 --> 01:07:09.458
when we plane shift to other worlds.

01:07:09.458 --> 01:07:15.505
TALIESIN: I'm going to take one to the library and
inspect it. I'm going to also see what any of our

01:07:15.505 --> 01:07:19.011
other arcanists think of it. If it's from a cult
that anybody has heard of before.

01:07:19.011 --> 01:07:22.540
MARISHA: I think I can plane shift us there with
it if we don't want to go through the orb.

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:23.726
TALIESIN: Really?

01:07:23.726 --> 01:07:28.762
MARISHA: I think. It seems like very similar
technology. Magic.

01:07:28.762 --> 01:07:30.979
TALIESIN: I'm rubbing off on you.

01:07:30.979 --> 01:07:38.571
MARISHA: Yeah. I don't know. Sleep on it. I'm
going to go think.

01:07:38.571 --> 01:07:47.475
TALIESIN: I have no idea what just happened. Yeah.
I'm going to double-check the orb room just for a

01:07:47.475 --> 01:07:49.314
moment, for my own paranoia.

01:07:49.314 --> 01:07:51.865
MARISHA: The crisis orb room? Actually, I'll go
with him.

01:07:51.865 --> 01:07:57.206
TALIESIN: Just to look, and then I'm going to
start researching that symbol. I'm going to go to

01:07:57.206 --> 01:08:00.327
the library and I'm showing the council
everything.

01:08:00.327 --> 01:08:10.338
MATT: Okay. You speak with the rest of the
standing chamber. You begin to do your research.

01:08:10.338 --> 01:08:13.646
Make a history check.

01:08:13.646 --> 01:08:20.741
MARISHA: Oh, that's good! Take it.

01:08:20.741 --> 01:08:22.270
TALIESIN: 22.

01:08:22.270 --> 01:08:30.693
MATT: 22. You've read through most of the books
here, between you and JB, who's spent some time

01:08:30.693 --> 01:08:38.893
also reading quite a bit. There's no mention of
the symbol itself, and there's very little

01:08:38.893 --> 01:08:46.126
information on the Whispered One, on Vecna. It's
interesting: there's almost a gap in history.

01:08:46.126 --> 01:08:55.683
There are subtle mentions of this figure, this
once-powerful mage that had begun to look into the

01:08:55.683 --> 01:09:06.409
secrets of life, prolonging it. The fabric of
reality. And then it's just missing from history.

01:09:06.409 --> 01:09:19.522
And you recall... all the books that would cover
that time period, you remember hearing stories

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:26.624
from Allura regarding the Whispered One,
originally. There's no mention.

01:09:26.624 --> 01:09:35.039
TALIESIN: Is it a physical omission from the
books, or is it even that the books that would

01:09:35.039 --> 01:09:41.124
cover it are not here? Books that should cover it
that don't?

01:09:41.124 --> 01:09:49.214
MATT: Books that you feel like should cover it.
Historical recalling of Wildmount, which if you

01:09:49.214 --> 01:09:54.290
recall, based on some of Allura's discussion on
the Whispered One's previous existence as a

01:09:54.290 --> 01:10:02.494
mortal, largely, Vecna's work was done over on the
Wildmount side of Exandria.

01:10:02.494 --> 01:10:04.352
TALIESIN: And there's no--

01:10:04.352 --> 01:10:09.792
MARISHA: Bitch! Sorry. Go on.

01:10:09.792 --> 01:10:11.665
TALIESIN: I don't know what's happening over
here.

01:10:11.665 --> 01:10:12.898
MATT: I don't, either.

01:10:12.898 --> 01:10:18.126
TALIESIN: There's nothing that's simple. Like, the
more I'm looking, I'm looking for

01:10:18.126 --> 01:10:19.617
mention of the symbols--

01:10:19.617 --> 01:10:20.746
MATT: No.

01:10:20.746 --> 01:10:26.175
TALIESIN: Keyleth, you know damn well where I am
right now, I'm sitting in the library reading

01:10:26.175 --> 01:10:29.684
books, so if you have something to say. Oh, wow,
you're going way back.

01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:36.334
MARISHA: I'm looking. I'll meet you in the
library.

01:10:36.334 --> 01:10:38.293
SAM: How to Play Pathfinder.

01:10:38.293 --> 01:10:42.524
(laughter)

01:10:42.524 --> 01:10:44.447
TALIESIN: Is that Hercules Mulligan?

01:10:44.447 --> 01:10:46.681
MARISHA: This is a tiny Hercules Mulligan. I was
looking for him!

01:10:46.681 --> 01:10:51.148
He's been in here the whole time.

01:10:51.148 --> 01:10:54.145
LIAM: Delilah gets knocked out, she gets the fuck
back up again!

01:10:54.145 --> 01:10:56.285
TALIESIN: Four set of corsets.

01:10:56.285 --> 01:11:03.676
MATT: He's a barbarian, I think it is. We have to
work out the 5e classes for the Hamilton

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:05.806
characters. Get on it, Critters.

01:11:05.806 --> 01:11:08.801
TALIESIN: I'll let everyone know where I am, too.
I'm in the library reading if anybody needs me.

01:11:08.801 --> 01:11:11.635
MATT: Anyone else wishing to accomplish anything
else?

01:11:11.635 --> 01:11:19.589
TRAVIS: I'm in the kitchen. I want to see if they
can make a salad with meat in it.

01:11:19.589 --> 01:11:23.608
TALIESIN: If they figure out how, bring some up to
the library.

01:11:23.608 --> 01:11:25.112
TRAVIS: Okay, I'm not very up to--

01:11:25.112 --> 01:11:29.049
TALIESIN: Deposit it up.

01:11:29.049 --> 01:11:35.387
MATT: Grand Poobah, if this is indeed your
request, they will do their very best to do so.

01:11:35.387 --> 01:11:42.010
Within an hour or so, you are presented with a
bowl of various textures of shredded, cured, and

01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:45.260
prepared meats to loosely resemble a salad, I
guess.

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:46.320
TALIESIN: A malad!

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.877
MATT: It's like a giant poke bowl.

01:11:47.877 --> 01:11:50.797
SAM: It's not a salad with meat on it, it's a
salad made of meat?

01:11:50.797 --> 01:11:52.423
LIAM: Thin slices.

01:11:52.423 --> 01:11:55.584
TRAVIS: This is far greater than anything I could
have hoped for.

01:11:55.584 --> 01:11:57.509
TALIESIN: Previously, on Hannibal.

01:11:57.509 --> 01:12:00.646
TRAVIS: Did you invent this just now?

01:12:00.646 --> 01:12:07.330
MATT: You look at the wait staff and they,
"Actually, sir, it was Chef Varon." You look over

01:12:07.330 --> 01:12:11.299
and you see this one, and you've seen a couple of
the chefs here, you haven't interfaced with them

01:12:11.299 --> 01:12:15.073
too much. You're not a social figure necessarily,
more of a demanding figure when it comes to the

01:12:15.073 --> 01:12:23.956
food and the meal. But you see this gentleman with
this thin John Waters pencil mustache, this

01:12:23.956 --> 01:12:31.848
thinning hair that's short, but slick, with a bit
of pattern baldness going on. He's a bit thick

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:35.008
around the waist and he's sitting there with a
big, beaming grin of pride.

01:12:35.008 --> 01:12:43.337
TRAVIS: Chef, this is going to put you on the map.
We need to name it.

01:12:43.337 --> 01:12:51.586
MATT: "Oh, well, Grand Poobah, I image that would
be your honor to give. I am but humbled to present

01:12:51.586 --> 01:12:54.691
"you with such a meal, so the choice is yours."

01:12:54.691 --> 01:12:59.824
TRAVIS: What fine tender meats are in this dish?

01:12:59.824 --> 01:13:06.400
MATT: "Oh, well, we've got quite a variety. I
wanted to provide an extravagant walk through the

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:13.201
"various creatures that we prepare here in
Whitestone. Would you like me to continue?"

01:13:13.201 --> 01:13:15.858
TRAVIS: Please, yes! I'm talking to myself.

01:13:15.858 --> 01:13:24.163
MATT: "We have two-week salted goat meat. On top
of that we have hickory-kept long angle-smoked

01:13:24.163 --> 01:13:35.269
"fish guts mixed in there with a wondrous mix of
minced steaks, we've spared no possible expense on

01:13:35.269 --> 01:13:42.080
"the various pieces of the cow. We've, from that
point forward, presented a sprinkling of pork

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:48.603
"belly that's been ground up and salt-cured as well
over the period of about two months usually kept

01:13:48.603 --> 01:13:51.447
"to our various steam meals, but I thought this was
a special occasion."

01:13:51.447 --> 01:13:55.020
TRAVIS: I'm just free-dripping saliva in and on
the plate.

01:13:55.020 --> 01:14:03.293
MATT: "So, it has a very sedimentary layers of the
planet-type feel to it where each reveal occurs

01:14:03.293 --> 01:14:07.613
"it's a whole different genus of animal. You're
eating nature in a bowl!"

01:14:07.613 --> 01:14:12.821
TRAVIS: I mean, did you even, like, salt it or
nothing? It's just all these beautiful animals in

01:14:12.821 --> 01:14:14.755
my own private ark of a bowl?

01:14:14.755 --> 01:14:16.971
MATT: "They &lt;i&gt;came&lt;/i&gt; salted."

01:14:16.971 --> 01:14:23.148
TRAVIS: Well, because it's got goat, fish, beef,
and pork in it I'm going to call it the GoFiBePo.

01:14:23.148 --> 01:14:27.148
MATT: "GoFiBePo it is."

01:14:27.148 --> 01:14:33.422
TRAVIS: But, like, you seem to have an accent, so
let's put a little flair on it when you say it.

01:14:33.422 --> 01:14:37.877
The bowl of GoFiBePo.

01:14:37.877 --> 01:14:40.089
MATT: "GoFiBePo."

01:14:40.089 --> 01:14:41.420
TRAVIS: I like it.

01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:43.697
MATT: "Of course, Grand Poobah."

01:14:43.697 --> 01:14:49.428
TRAVIS: And I must decree there will be no
utensils used when you dine of this sublime dish.

01:14:49.428 --> 01:14:56.008
MATT: He begins writing these things down. "All
right, all right. You would need approval from

01:14:56.008 --> 01:15:01.186
"Lady Cassandra, of course, to put this in the
familial--"

01:15:01.186 --> 01:15:02.275
TRAVIS: Approval?

01:15:02.275 --> 01:15:07.155
MATT: "Well, if you were to make this the official
meal of Whitestone, that is entirely within--"

01:15:07.155 --> 01:15:17.362
TRAVIS: This just gets better and better. Submit
whatever paperwork is necessary.

01:15:17.362 --> 01:15:19.024
See that it's done.

01:15:19.024 --> 01:15:22.423
(laughter)

01:15:22.423 --> 01:15:25.485
MATT: "You heard him, folks! Grand Poobah has
spoken."

01:15:25.485 --> 01:15:27.268
TRAVIS: GoFiBePo.

01:15:27.268 --> 01:15:30.006
MATT: GoFiBePo.

01:15:30.006 --> 01:15:35.284
TRAVIS: Even better. And I'll just start
hand-smashing into my face this

01:15:35.284 --> 01:15:38.829
delicious salted meat collection.

01:15:38.829 --> 01:15:40.886
LAURA: I'm hungry now.

01:15:40.886 --> 01:15:43.575
MATT: Yeah. Oh, it is delightful. It is
delicious.

01:15:43.575 --> 01:15:47.877
TRAVIS: You should not be able to make up food
that delicious just on the fly like that. I

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:52.595
literally felt like I was at a fucking restaurant.
That was absurd.

01:15:52.595 --> 01:15:53.891
LAURA: I want to eat it!

01:15:53.891 --> 01:15:56.523
TALIESIN: As I was saying 'Grand Poobah', I knew
it was going to bite me in the ass.

01:15:56.523 --> 01:15:58.037
I don't know how.

01:15:58.037 --> 01:15:59.903
TRAVIS: Meat salad. You're welcome.

01:15:59.903 --> 01:16:04.250
TALIESIN: It actually sounds really good. Cured
goat meat.

01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:06.581
MATT: And it's currently being submitted to the
senate of Whitestone for approval

01:16:06.581 --> 01:16:08.532
to become the official dish.

01:16:08.532 --> 01:16:12.615
TRAVIS: Yeah! After every battle, we'll get all
the protein we need and we'll just fart our happy

01:16:12.615 --> 01:16:14.223
asses off, all night long.

01:16:14.223 --> 01:16:16.110
LIAM: It's all shabu-shabu from here on out.

01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:22.041
MATT: Yeah. With a constitution check it might
improve your speed. All right. So. What else do

01:16:22.041 --> 01:16:25.801
you wish to do, as it is now getting close to the
midnight hour here at Whitestone?

01:16:25.801 --> 01:16:28.913
ASHLEY: I've been an extra set of eyes in the
library.

01:16:28.913 --> 01:16:31.696
MARISHA: Yeah, and I call Vex there as well.

01:16:31.696 --> 01:16:39.728
LAURA: Be there in just a moment, dear. I just
want to find Vax. Can I find Vax?

01:16:39.728 --> 01:16:41.980
LIAM: You can certainly try.

01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:50.574
LAURA: I'm going to go look-- I'll look in his
room and then I'll look in the temple to the Raven

01:16:50.574 --> 01:16:51.957
Queen that we have.

01:16:51.957 --> 01:16:53.255
LIAM: I'm in my room.

01:16:53.255 --> 01:16:54.499
LAURA: Hey!

01:16:54.499 --> 01:16:56.621
LIAM: Kiki, is that-- Oh.

01:16:56.621 --> 01:17:01.159
LAURA: Oh. Well. No. Hi. That's gross.

01:17:01.159 --> 01:17:02.830
LIAM: Is it, though? Is it?

01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:10.621
LAURA: Is it? Hey. One quick thing that I was
thinking about, and I know that you keep bringing

01:17:10.621 --> 01:17:12.519
it up and I keep dodging this, right?

01:17:12.519 --> 01:17:13.532
LIAM: Right.

01:17:13.532 --> 01:17:17.109
LAURA: But-- So, when I was researching the Raven
Queen--

01:17:17.109 --> 01:17:18.162
LIAM: Yes.

01:17:18.162 --> 01:17:21.062
LAURA: -- she hates undead.

01:17:21.062 --> 01:17:23.313
LIAM: That's kind of her thing, yeah.

01:17:23.313 --> 01:17:31.588
LAURA: So the fact that Delilah Briarwood is back
again and the person that we're going after, it

01:17:31.588 --> 01:17:32.964
seems perfect.

01:17:32.964 --> 01:17:36.772
LIAM: Almost like fate, isn't it?

01:17:36.772 --> 01:17:37.771
LAURA: Hey.

01:17:37.771 --> 01:17:38.687
LIAM: Hey.

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:44.394
LAURA: Do you think your queen lady is going to
chime in there and help us out? Maybe end this

01:17:44.394 --> 01:17:48.063
cycle of whatever the fuck it is she's doing.

01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:49.631
LIAM: She will be there.

01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:51.489
LAURA: In the Shadowfell?

01:17:51.489 --> 01:17:56.745
LIAM: She will be with us when we reach the end.

01:17:56.745 --> 01:17:59.824
LAURA: That's so cryptic.

01:17:59.824 --> 01:18:01.913
LIAM: Well, it is religion.

01:18:01.913 --> 01:18:03.106
LAURA: Right.

01:18:03.106 --> 01:18:04.115
LIAM: Right.

01:18:04.115 --> 01:18:05.221
LAURA: Okay.

01:18:05.221 --> 01:18:12.072
LIAM: I mean, like Pike has always said, I don't
have all the answers at all.

01:18:12.072 --> 01:18:17.598
LAURA: No. I mean, do you talk to her, though?
Because, you know, Pike talks to Sarenrae.

01:18:17.598 --> 01:18:18.832
LIAM: I do.

01:18:18.832 --> 01:18:23.504
LAURA: Right! So have you asked her if she's going
to help us kill Delilah Briarwood?

01:18:23.504 --> 01:18:29.816
LIAM: You know, she's not very big on specifics.
It's more of a vibe kind of thing.

01:18:29.816 --> 01:18:31.213
LAURA: Okay.

01:18:31.213 --> 01:18:41.207
LIAM: But the vibe I get, I'm not going to call it
good. This is it. This is what you and I have been

01:18:41.207 --> 01:18:42.829
doing our homework for.

01:18:42.829 --> 01:18:44.895
LAURA: All right.

01:18:44.895 --> 01:18:48.020
LIAM: And it's not going to slow down, it's only
going to speed up.

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:50.482
LAURA: Well.

01:18:50.482 --> 01:18:56.861
LIAM: I don't think I'm going back to Zephra
anytime soon.

01:18:56.861 --> 01:19:06.165
LAURA: Not necessarily. Don't talk like that. I'm
serious. You have to keep a positive outlook.

01:19:06.165 --> 01:19:07.817
Otherwise you're doomed.

01:19:07.817 --> 01:19:10.852
LIAM: This is the best year of my life. I'm very
happy.

01:19:10.852 --> 01:19:12.105
LAURA: That's good.

01:19:12.105 --> 01:19:13.118
LIAM: Life is good.

01:19:13.118 --> 01:19:14.387
LAURA: Life is good.

01:19:14.387 --> 01:19:16.511
LIAM: We're going to ensure that it stays that
way.

01:19:16.511 --> 01:19:21.495
LAURA: Yeah. All right.

01:19:21.495 --> 01:19:25.048
LIAM: Sorry I didn't have more for you.

01:19:25.048 --> 01:19:27.779
LAURA: No no no! It's about what I expected.

01:19:27.779 --> 01:19:33.439
LIAM: Hmm. If you see my druid, would you send her
to bed?

01:19:33.439 --> 01:19:35.138
LAURA: Yes.

01:19:35.138 --> 01:19:36.541
LIAM: Thank you.

01:19:36.541 --> 01:19:38.586
LAURA: Good night.

01:19:38.586 --> 01:19:39.874
LIAM: Good night.

01:19:39.874 --> 01:19:41.742
LAURA: And I go to the library.

01:19:41.742 --> 01:19:42.815
MATT: Okay.

01:19:42.815 --> 01:19:44.165
TRAVIS: Boring.

01:19:44.165 --> 01:19:48.915
MATT: Now, Percival, Keyleth. Pike, I believe
you're helping out in the library as well?

01:19:48.915 --> 01:19:51.237
TALIESIN: We're literally reading through old
notes right now.

01:19:51.237 --> 01:19:52.816
MARISHA: A fuckton of old notes.

01:19:52.816 --> 01:19:57.928
MATT: Well, Vex arrives to meet up with you guys
in the library of Whitestone. Whatever you're

01:19:57.928 --> 01:19:59.295
doing, Scanlan, I don't know.

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:00.132
MARISHA: Vex.

01:20:00.132 --> 01:20:01.068
LAURA: What?

01:20:01.068 --> 01:20:06.270
MARISHA: Okay. Oh my gosh. Oh. Okay. Oh, praise
Sarenrae, there's so much going on. Okay. Remember

01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:12.077
how Whitestone used to be all dead and awful? Very
similar to how the other Ziggurat was dead?

01:20:12.077 --> 01:20:13.239
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

01:20:13.239 --> 01:20:17.762
MARISHA: And then they called the ziggurat the
seat of Pelor, right? So what if it was already

01:20:17.762 --> 01:20:23.826
there? What if she's taking doorways and
dimensions and corrupting them

01:20:23.826 --> 01:20:26.523
and bastardizing them and--

01:20:26.523 --> 01:20:35.090
LAURA: If she's done that, if she did that to the
Sun Tree, how old is Delilah Briarwood?

01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:38.746
TALIESIN: Well, we don't--

01:20:38.746 --> 01:20:41.165
MATT: The Sun Tree has been around since before--

01:20:41.165 --> 01:20:47.583
TALIESIN: The Sun Tree was here before the castle
was here, but-- And things have always happened

01:20:47.583 --> 01:20:54.652
here. The city has a history of strange
occurrences. I'm inclined to believe there was

01:20:54.652 --> 01:20:59.041
something-- Well, there was obviously something
beneath the castle before she got here, or else

01:20:59.041 --> 01:21:00.699
she wouldn't have come here to begin with.

01:21:00.699 --> 01:21:02.514
LAURA: It was a temple to Ioun.

01:21:02.514 --> 01:21:09.782
MATT: The history, you know, is back in the Age of
Arcanum, this valley housed a temple to Ioun,

01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:15.790
which was corrupted, and in the Calamity, the
battle between the gods and mortals that changed

01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:22.628
the epoch, the Knowing Mistress suffered a
grievous wound from Tharizdun, the Chained

01:21:22.628 --> 01:21:30.218
Oblivion. And in that battle, Pelor, the Dawn
Father, delivered enough of a blow to the Chained

01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:37.528
Oblivion to defeat it and aid in locking it away.
With the temple still lost beneath this valley,

01:21:37.528 --> 01:21:43.307
that was when the Sun Tree seed was planted by
Pelor to be guardian over this space.

01:21:43.307 --> 01:21:44.846
MARISHA: What was he locking away?

01:21:44.846 --> 01:21:47.614
MATT: A god called the Chained Oblivion.

01:21:47.614 --> 01:21:50.715
MARISHA: The Chain Oblivion?

01:21:50.715 --> 01:21:55.689
MATT: The Chained Oblivion. Tharizdun. Yeah. A mad
god of chaos and destruction.

01:21:55.689 --> 01:21:57.398
LIAM: Totally awesome metal band.

01:21:57.398 --> 01:21:59.077
TRAVIS: Yeah, great name.

01:21:59.077 --> 01:22:02.145
MARISHA: Okay, well, that's a big deal.

01:22:02.145 --> 01:22:10.319
TALIESIN: And, I mean, I think it's safe to assume
that that's what's down there and that's what they

01:22:10.319 --> 01:22:12.582
were looking for when they came here in the first
place.

01:22:12.582 --> 01:22:13.769
LAURA: Right.

01:22:13.769 --> 01:22:19.551
MARISHA: And Delilah came from Wildmount?

01:22:19.551 --> 01:22:23.707
TALIESIN: Yes. She was also, I mean--

01:22:23.707 --> 01:22:28.191
MARISHA: You did a bunch of research on Vecna. He
used to be a man, right?

01:22:28.191 --> 01:22:30.632
TALIESIN AND LAURA: Yes.

01:22:30.632 --> 01:22:34.693
LAURA: He wanted to become the Prince of the
Undead, right? Am I saying that right? No no no.

01:22:34.693 --> 01:22:42.195
MATT: From what you've come to understand and the
research you've done since the name has come up--

01:22:42.195 --> 01:22:44.434
TALIESIN: I'm pulling out my notes.

01:22:44.434 --> 01:22:46.379
LIAM: We spent a year reading books.

01:22:46.379 --> 01:22:49.435
MATT: Right. Now mind you, the information is
still very hard to find.

01:22:49.435 --> 01:22:51.100
LAURA: Because he's the god of secrets?

01:22:51.100 --> 01:23:03.133
MATT: He's not a god. Wants to be, or at least
wants to, and there is some obsession with the

01:23:03.133 --> 01:23:12.923
ascension of a mortal to a beyond-mortal state.
Which has only been achieved by one being before.

01:23:12.923 --> 01:23:16.865
MARISHA: I mean, it sounds a lot like what Delilah
is going for.

01:23:16.865 --> 01:23:19.639
LAURA: What if she &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; Vecna?

01:23:19.639 --> 01:23:21.946
MARISHA: What if she &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; Vecna?

01:23:21.946 --> 01:23:24.948
TALIESIN: Well, or she wants to become the next
Vecna.

01:23:24.948 --> 01:23:39.528
MARISHA: Yeah. Dread Pirate Roberts of the Vecna.
She came from Wildmount, where Vecna originated.

01:23:39.528 --> 01:23:41.584
She came here for research.

01:23:41.584 --> 01:23:44.368
LAURA: She's just finishing what he started.

01:23:44.368 --> 01:23:49.054
MARISHA: Maybe she's just finishing what he
started. And wasn't she doing a bunch of research

01:23:49.054 --> 01:23:54.360
for runes and tomes? Do we have the research that
the Briarwoods--

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:56.397
Didn't we seize a bunch of their research?

01:23:56.397 --> 01:23:59.392
TALIESIN: We got some of it, but they burned a
lot.

01:23:59.392 --> 01:24:04.875
MATT: You got some of it and a lot of it dealt
with ley energies. There are certain lines that

01:24:04.875 --> 01:24:09.938
stretch across, invisible lines that stretch
across Exandria, where the magical powers that

01:24:09.938 --> 01:24:13.790
hold together the planes and protect it through
the Divine Gate and other elements--

01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:18.272
MARISHA: Do any of those ley lines go through
where we were in Marquet?

01:24:18.272 --> 01:24:24.617
MATT: You don't know that. But you do know that
Whitestone resides right beneath a nexus. These

01:24:24.617 --> 01:24:31.926
ley lines were shifted during the Calamity. And
now one of these nexuses is right over Whitestone,

01:24:31.926 --> 01:24:37.395
which is why this location was chosen for the
ritual that the Briarwoods were assembling.

01:24:37.395 --> 01:24:40.623
MARISHA: I wonder if each ziggurat is over a
nexus.

01:24:40.623 --> 01:24:46.956
TALIESIN: It could be. We know that she's not 
ancient, because we have a bit of a paper

01:24:46.956 --> 01:24:55.065
trail. We do know that she was ruling in Wildmount
for a while. We do know that she studied at the

01:24:55.065 --> 01:24:59.827
Alabaster Lyceum briefly. And there's some
paperwork for that.

01:24:59.827 --> 01:25:09.419
MATT: In looking up the background history, you
would know that King Bertrand Dwendal of the

01:25:09.419 --> 01:25:19.679
Dwendalian Empire was given information in regards
to the Briarwoods, who were essentially accused of

01:25:19.679 --> 01:25:27.211
forbidden necromancy. And were to be arrested and
put on trial, and that's when they fled westward

01:25:27.211 --> 01:25:31.879
towards Tal'Dorei and then encountered your
family.

01:25:31.879 --> 01:25:32.958
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:25:32.958 --> 01:25:34.409
LAURA: So they got run out of Wildmount?

01:25:34.409 --> 01:25:35.380
MATT: Seemingly.

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:40.776
TALIESIN: From what we understand and again,
there's not much that survived that. They tend to

01:25:40.776 --> 01:25:42.171
cover their tracks.

01:25:42.171 --> 01:25:45.772
MARISHA: They were also trying to build that whole
bridge situation? Remember the bridge?

01:25:45.772 --> 01:25:46.916
That was weird.

01:25:46.916 --> 01:25:48.452
TALIESIN: They wanted to move. Well--

01:25:48.452 --> 01:25:51.127
MARISHA: They wanted to move an army. Right?

01:25:51.127 --> 01:25:56.413
MATT: The bridge, from what you can tell, there
was no way, plans or means of even building a

01:25:56.413 --> 01:25:59.951
bridge. And a bridge has been attempted in the
past over the Shearing Channel and it's just too--

01:25:59.951 --> 01:26:07.389
The cliffs are too steep and too windy and the
water beneath is too strong. Which is why the

01:26:07.389 --> 01:26:14.280
prospect to the previous sovereign was such a
possible good thing to make a deal with the

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:18.049
Briarwoods at the time. But there are no plans.
Nothing in their notes spoke of actually making a

01:26:18.049 --> 01:26:22.352
bridge. It was more a means to get into the graces
of the royal family.

01:26:22.352 --> 01:26:24.592
TALIESIN: And probably collect assets as well.

01:26:24.592 --> 01:26:26.882
MARISHA: Okay. If you were run out of somewhere--

01:26:26.882 --> 01:26:29.119
TALIESIN: Which I have been.

01:26:29.119 --> 01:26:32.126
MARISHA: Which you have been. After a lot of
research--

01:26:32.126 --> 01:26:33.281
TALIESIN: Which I've done.

01:26:33.281 --> 01:26:35.175
MARISHA: -- and you were trying to do something--

01:26:35.175 --> 01:26:36.581
TALIESIN: Which I do.

01:26:36.581 --> 01:26:44.516
MARISHA: -- what would be your second place of
choosing to go?

01:26:44.516 --> 01:26:47.513
TALIESIN: Anywhere that they serve some sort of
meat salad, I imagine.

01:26:47.513 --> 01:26:51.000
(laughter)

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.968
MARISHA: I'm just saying, if you're run out of one
place for doing something, I imagine--

01:26:53.968 --> 01:26:56.108
TALIESIN: You're thinking maybe they have another
portal in Wildmount.

01:26:56.108 --> 01:26:57.319
MARISHA: Yes, I do.

01:26:57.319 --> 01:26:58.657
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:26:58.657 --> 01:27:00.199
LAURA: Another ziggurat?

01:27:00.199 --> 01:27:01.978
TALIESIN: Could be several of them.

01:27:01.978 --> 01:27:06.617
MARISHA: If they are run out of one place for
something, my first thing would be try to find the

01:27:06.617 --> 01:27:08.245
next place to keep it going.

01:27:08.245 --> 01:27:10.842
LAURA: Right. And then she got run out of here, so
she went to Ank'harel.

01:27:10.842 --> 01:27:17.366
MARISHA: Correct. What if she's already been
killed in Wildmount? So many theories, you guys.

01:27:17.366 --> 01:27:19.897
So many theories! It's kind of exciting.

01:27:19.897 --> 01:27:21.528
TALIESIN: Let's not get overly speculative here.

01:27:21.528 --> 01:27:23.246
TRAVIS: Are ziggurats always pyramids?

01:27:23.246 --> 01:27:28.233
LIAM: That's what a ziggurat is. It's like an
Aztec bip-bip-bip.

01:27:28.233 --> 01:27:33.018
MARISHA: We know the Briarwoods also did dealings
with the Stormwinds in Wildmount.

01:27:33.018 --> 01:27:35.186
LAURA: What other pyramids have we seen, though?
Have we seen any other--

01:27:35.186 --> 01:27:39.434
TRAVIS: The thing we fought the beholder in.

01:27:39.434 --> 01:27:42.212
LAURA: The mindflayer place. That was a ziggurat.

01:27:42.212 --> 01:27:47.397
MARISHA: Son of a bitch!

01:27:47.397 --> 01:27:50.431
LAURA: Under Kraghammer! Oh my god! Is there a
ziggurat in Kraghammer?

01:27:50.431 --> 01:27:52.754
LIAM: Hell yeah there is a ziggurat. Yeah, it was
a ziggurat.

01:27:52.754 --> 01:27:55.510
MATT: You've seen a few, actually.

01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:59.062
LIAM: I'm speaking in my voice because I'm not
there, but he said-- Yeah, oh, he's poker-facing

01:27:59.062 --> 01:28:02.214
it. We said ziggurat many times when we were down
there.

01:28:02.214 --> 01:28:06.865
MARISHA: Did we see a pyramid when we were in
Wildmount? When we went there?

01:28:06.865 --> 01:28:08.659
TALIESIN: We were barely there, though.

01:28:08.659 --> 01:28:14.704
LAURA: But it would've been underground. I mean,
who knows where the fuck it was? Wait, wait, wait!

01:28:14.704 --> 01:28:19.488
What about the temple where we saw the other
sphinx? Was that another ziggurat there?

01:28:19.488 --> 01:28:24.577
MARISHA: And that was up in Vasselheim! Thank you.

01:28:24.577 --> 01:28:26.408
LAURA: Ah! Is there a ziggurat--

01:28:26.408 --> 01:28:30.514
MARISHA: There's a ziggurat on every continent!
(singing) Every continent has a ziggurat.

01:28:30.514 --> 01:28:32.616
LAURA: They can come out everywhere.

01:28:32.616 --> 01:28:35.463
TRAVIS: So collapsing the tunnels didn't really do
that much.

01:28:35.463 --> 01:28:41.024
TALIESIN: No, because it shut one potential vein
of a dozen.

01:28:41.024 --> 01:28:45.044
MARISHA: It's these damn ley lines. I knew there's
been something up with these ley lines and I tried

01:28:45.044 --> 01:28:47.137
to talk to the Sun Tree about it and he didn't
know.

01:28:47.137 --> 01:28:48.190
LAURA: Well, he's a tree.

01:28:48.190 --> 01:28:49.402
MARISHA: He's a tree.

01:28:49.402 --> 01:28:51.205
TALIESIN: Be nice to the Sun Tree.

01:28:51.205 --> 01:28:52.439
MARISHA: No, he's very cool.

01:28:52.439 --> 01:28:55.998
TRAVIS: So all the bodies that were hanging under
Whitestone, right, they were all stapled to the

01:28:55.998 --> 01:29:00.057
walls? Was that the army? Was she trying to fill
them with necromantic energy?

01:29:00.057 --> 01:29:02.828
TALIESIN: Oh my god, they would've come alive if
there had been a giant blast of necrotic energy.

01:29:02.828 --> 01:29:05.313
TRAVIS: Yeah. The bodies weren't feeding the
thing. She was trying to imbue them with--

01:29:05.313 --> 01:29:07.033
TALIESIN: She was preparing to create an army.

01:29:07.033 --> 01:29:08.445
LIAM: Yeah. And they were missing arms?

01:29:08.445 --> 01:29:12.220
LAURA: We didn't look in the ziggurat in
Ank'harel. There could've been bodies there, too.

01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:13.828
TALIESIN: I don't think they had gotten that far
yet.

01:29:13.828 --> 01:29:16.590
MARISHA: And one of the things I have written
down.

01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:20.493
TRAVIS: Why were they throwing magical things into
it, though? It was magical items into--

01:29:20.493 --> 01:29:23.731
TALIESIN: Offerings? Because they would've become
magical once they got to the other side of the

01:29:23.731 --> 01:29:25.628
portal. I mean, they would've been great gifts.

01:29:25.628 --> 01:29:28.062
LIAM: What do you think, Taryon Darrington? Or
Scanlan.

01:29:28.062 --> 01:29:31.082
MATT: Tary is fixing Doty.

01:29:31.082 --> 01:29:33.789
SAM: I'm just giving him CPR.

01:29:33.789 --> 01:29:35.587
(laughter)

01:29:35.587 --> 01:29:37.405
SAM: You've never given up on anything in your
life. Now live!

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:39.669
(laughter)

01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:45.399
LIAM: Ed Harris in The Abyss. You've never given
up a day in your life, you bitch.

01:29:45.399 --> 01:29:48.109
ASHLEY: Scanlan?

01:29:48.109 --> 01:29:50.631
SAM: I'm in my room, praying.

01:29:50.631 --> 01:29:51.966
LAURA: You're not here?

01:29:51.966 --> 01:29:53.585
MARISHA: In your room, praying?

01:29:53.585 --> 01:29:54.889
LAURA: Praying to Sarenrae?

01:29:54.889 --> 01:29:56.706
SAM: Mm-hm. Or Logic.

01:29:56.706 --> 01:29:59.954
(laughter)

01:29:59.954 --> 01:30:02.029
TALIESIN: Logic is a fickle god.

01:30:02.029 --> 01:30:08.087
MARISHA: Yeah. Desmond (mumbles). Briarwood's
carriage driver.

01:30:08.087 --> 01:30:10.583
Lady Briarwood is immune to daylight.

01:30:10.583 --> 01:30:12.716
TALIESIN: It's like watching your game in
fast-forward.

01:30:12.716 --> 01:30:18.001
MARISHA: Briarwoods have an army. I have it in
giant, big letters,

01:30:18.001 --> 01:30:19.677
but I don't know what that means.

01:30:19.677 --> 01:30:24.949
LAURA: Obviously, it would take a very long time
to go to every ziggurat that we've seen and see if

01:30:24.949 --> 01:30:29.835
there's an army inside of it. If they've been
preparing things there over this past year that we

01:30:29.835 --> 01:30:31.350
haven't been doing anything!

01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:34.706
TRAVIS: We don't know that any of this is right.
We should just go through.

01:30:34.706 --> 01:30:37.628
LAURA: We should go to the Shadowfell and fucking
end this before

01:30:37.628 --> 01:30:39.559
she sets out her armies everywhere.

01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:43.814
TRAVIS: We did let her regroup a little bit, but
we didn't know what we were doing.

01:30:43.814 --> 01:30:46.022
TALIESIN: There was nothing we could have done.

01:30:46.022 --> 01:30:53.125
TRAVIS: Do you want to mess with the stones? Try
and duplicate them? We have seven, right?

01:30:53.125 --> 01:30:55.210
LAURA: We have seven. We could go through.

01:30:55.210 --> 01:30:56.639
TALIESIN: Seven of us could go through.

01:30:56.639 --> 01:30:58.509
SAM: (whispering) We're only seven people.

01:30:58.509 --> 01:30:59.966
LAURA: There's only seven of us.

01:30:59.966 --> 01:31:02.374
TALIESIN: There's eight. One of us would have to
stay behind.

01:31:02.374 --> 01:31:04.136
SAM: Who's the eighth? Count the table, friend.

01:31:04.136 --> 01:31:05.552
TRAVIS: Tary's staying.

01:31:05.552 --> 01:31:08.454
TALIESIN: Tary's the eighth. Are we going to go
through with Tary?

01:31:08.454 --> 01:31:10.442
I'm being such an asshole right now.

01:31:10.442 --> 01:31:11.909
MATT: You're terrible.

01:31:11.909 --> 01:31:15.477
MARISHA: I could also maybe Plane Shift us there
with one of these?

01:31:15.477 --> 01:31:23.157
TRAVIS: If we take damage going through the portal
with the stone, does that mean we might take

01:31:23.157 --> 01:31:25.147
damage if you Plane Shift us there?

01:31:25.147 --> 01:31:26.974
LAURA: Who knows? It's the Shadowfell.

01:31:26.974 --> 01:31:32.259
TALIESIN: I say we speak with Allura, and if this
looks--

01:31:32.259 --> 01:31:39.625
LAURA: We need to talk to Eskil Ryndarien and see
what he knows about the Shadowfell, right? He's

01:31:39.625 --> 01:31:41.243
been studying the Shadowfell, too.

01:31:41.243 --> 01:31:42.424
MATT: Since he arrived, yeah.

01:31:42.424 --> 01:31:45.139
TALIESIN: I think the plan is we take the fight to
them.

01:31:45.139 --> 01:31:46.594
LAURA and TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:31:46.594 --> 01:31:52.000
MARISHA: Is it worth going back to any of the
other ziggurats, or no?

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.405
LAURA: I don't think so, at this point.

01:31:53.405 --> 01:31:58.351
TALIESIN: I think that it's not time to check the
doors. It's time to go out and chase the monsters.

01:31:58.351 --> 01:32:02.217
If we take care of them, it doesn't matter how
many ziggurats there are.

01:32:02.217 --> 01:32:03.489
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:32:03.489 --> 01:32:05.841
LAURA: We just have to--

01:32:05.841 --> 01:32:08.708
TALIESIN: Hope we don't miss one. Travel the
world.

01:32:08.708 --> 01:32:12.370
LAURA: Hey, at least Vecna's not a god. Bonus
there.

01:32:12.370 --> 01:32:13.818
MARISHA: That's true.

01:32:13.818 --> 01:32:19.291
TALIESIN: Let's have an evening, and then
tomorrow, we'll--

01:32:19.291 --> 01:32:21.292
TRAVIS: Tally-ho?

01:32:21.292 --> 01:32:27.494
TALIESIN: Collect what we've learned, and if we're
prepared, jump into a sphere of death.

01:32:27.494 --> 01:32:29.227
LAURA: We can't waste time.

01:32:29.227 --> 01:32:33.753
MARISHA: If we jump through the sphere of death,
they might be expecting us on the other side of

01:32:33.753 --> 01:32:39.472
the sphere of death. If we Plane Shift, we might
be able to come up with a

01:32:39.472 --> 01:32:42.086
flanky, secret, other tactic.

01:32:42.086 --> 01:32:45.493
TALIESIN: If you can figure out a way to use one
of these to create a Plane Shift that you'll feel

01:32:45.493 --> 01:32:50.398
comfortable with, then I'm all right with that.

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:53.408
MARISHA: I'll talk it over with other magic-users,
first.

01:32:53.408 --> 01:32:55.038
TRAVIS: Which ones?

01:32:55.038 --> 01:32:58.271
MARISHA: I don't know. I'll find one.

01:32:58.271 --> 01:33:01.321
LIAM: We can go visit one of them. I'm not there.

01:33:01.321 --> 01:33:02.721
MATT: You're not there.

01:33:02.721 --> 01:33:04.546
TRAVIS: Make the call.

01:33:04.546 --> 01:33:06.780
MARISHA: Eskil knows stuff like that.

01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:10.664
TALIESIN: Let's all get some sleep, and in the
morning, we're going to take care of this. One way

01:33:10.664 --> 01:33:12.328
or the other, we'll take this fight to them.

01:33:12.328 --> 01:33:15.103
LAURA: You'll talk to Eskil, because I hate that
motherfucker.

01:33:15.103 --> 01:33:18.819
TALIESIN: He likes you. Well, he doesn't dislike
you any more than he dislikes anybody else.

01:33:18.819 --> 01:33:22.488
MARISHA: He dislikes you even less. He just hates
everyone.

01:33:22.488 --> 01:33:24.771
TALIESIN: He's terrible, isn't he?

01:33:24.771 --> 01:33:26.386
LAURA: Crotchety old fuck.

01:33:26.386 --> 01:33:30.312
MATT: All right, so you're all going to go in for
the evening,

01:33:30.312 --> 01:33:32.179
and we'll come back to this in the morning.

01:33:32.179 --> 01:33:33.665
LIAM: Wait. One second.

01:33:33.665 --> 01:33:35.043
MATT: Sorry, go ahead.

01:33:35.043 --> 01:33:36.503
LIAM: Did you guys--

01:33:36.503 --> 01:33:39.056
MARISHA: Oh my gosh. We figured out so much
stuff.

01:33:39.056 --> 01:33:40.849
LIAM: Give me the download.

01:33:40.849 --> 01:33:45.030
MARISHA: Delilah might be Vecna, and all this,
there are ziggurats everywhere, and we're so dumb

01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:48.995
because we've probably seen several ziggurats, and
they're all on these massive ley lines, and I give

01:33:48.995 --> 01:33:50.069
him a whole dialogue.

01:33:50.069 --> 01:33:51.147
MATT: Okay.

01:33:51.147 --> 01:34:00.202
LIAM: Holy moly. Do you need to get word back
home? Because I don't think we're going home.

01:34:00.202 --> 01:34:02.076
MARISHA: What do you mean?

01:34:02.076 --> 01:34:08.129
LIAM: I mean, the dreams I've been having all year
and telling you about. They felt like this. This

01:34:08.129 --> 01:34:10.500
is the moment.

01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:15.359
MARISHA: You think if we go in, we're never coming
back?

01:34:15.359 --> 01:34:17.974
LIAM: I'm not saying that.

01:34:17.974 --> 01:34:25.421
MARISHA: You think if we go in, &lt;i&gt;you're&lt;/i&gt; never
coming back?

01:34:25.421 --> 01:34:31.427
LIAM: Well, I didn't say that, either. We were
going to go back in a day or two, and I don't

01:34:31.427 --> 01:34:38.213
think that's happening. Do you think everyone at
home, they're good?

01:34:38.213 --> 01:34:42.599
MARISHA: I'll have someone send a message.

01:34:42.599 --> 01:34:44.522
LIAM: Okay.

01:34:44.522 --> 01:34:52.468
MARISHA: You can't resign to this. You can't give
up on me.

01:34:52.468 --> 01:34:58.619
LIAM: Kiki, I'm not giving up. I will never give
up on you.

01:34:58.619 --> 01:35:02.221
MARISHA: I can see it in your eyes. You think this
is it.

01:35:02.221 --> 01:35:18.867
LIAM: I'm so glad that we're together for this,
whatever it is. And no, I'm not resigned. I would

01:35:18.867 --> 01:35:26.514
love to see you off to a very long life in Zephra.
No, with you. With you, until I'm not with you.

01:35:26.514 --> 01:35:34.476
Your dad's probably worrying. I worry about him
worrying about you, that's all.

01:35:34.476 --> 01:35:40.717
MARISHA: Really? Everything going on right now,
and you're worried about my dad? Typical

01:35:40.717 --> 01:35:42.799
boyfriend, I guess. That's fair.

01:35:42.799 --> 01:35:49.872
LIAM: You know, I am so anxious right now, and the
only thing that is going to distract me is all

01:35:49.872 --> 01:35:57.165
your fucking freckles, so come to bed, all right?
Come on.

01:35:57.165 --> 01:36:02.050
MARISHA: Promise me you'll come back with me, no
matter what.

01:36:02.050 --> 01:36:07.392
LIAM: I promise.

01:36:07.392 --> 01:36:10.847
MARISHA: Even if it doesn't happen, just promise.

01:36:10.847 --> 01:36:15.314
LIAM: Well, that's an easy promise to make. I
promise.

01:36:15.314 --> 01:36:18.134
MARISHA: I just need you to believe it.

01:36:18.134 --> 01:36:24.722
LIAM: I believe. Get the fuck in this bed.

01:36:24.722 --> 01:36:26.118
MARISHA: Sure.

01:36:26.118 --> 01:36:31.665
MATT: Okay, so you all find your evening's rest,
preparing for the next morning in whatever means

01:36:31.665 --> 01:36:37.527
you wish to prepare for. We're going to take a
break. We'll be back here in a few minutes to pick

01:36:37.527 --> 01:36:43.574
up this next length of the journey and see where
it takes us. We're giving away on the break a

01:36:43.574 --> 01:36:47.161
Purpleheart dice box from Wyrmwood.

01:36:47.161 --> 01:36:49.596
LIAM: That's the most beautiful one.

01:36:49.596 --> 01:36:51.343
LAURA and ASHLEY: The Scanlan wood!

01:36:51.343 --> 01:36:55.232
MATT: Get that Scanlan wood!

01:36:55.232 --> 01:36:58.266
LIAM: I mean, the Gabon ebony is really nice, but
the Purpleheart--

01:36:58.266 --> 01:36:59.660
SAM: Did you say gay-bone?

01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:01.096
LIAM: It's the Gabon. Gabon?

01:37:01.096 --> 01:37:08.571
MATT: Yes, so for that contest you need to come
over to Twitch chat, and I've actually forgotten

01:37:08.571 --> 01:37:11.388
what word we chose for today.

01:37:11.388 --> 01:37:12.646
SAM: Scorsese.

01:37:12.702 --> 01:37:21.495
MATT: (laughs) What was the word? Thank you.
Whisper. The word is whisper. So go ahead and when

01:37:21.495 --> 01:37:25.208
prompted, enter "whisper" into the chat room to
enter, and we'll come back after the break to

01:37:25.208 --> 01:37:28.300
announce who the lucky winner is. We'll see you
guys in a few minutes.

01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:29.613
(cheering)

01:37:29.613 --> 01:59:14.174
[break]

01:59:14.174 --> 01:59:21.084
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to
Critical Role. Oh god, they're closer now. I'm

01:59:21.084 --> 01:59:23.669
starting to rethink this scenario.

01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:25.597
LIAM: Life comes at you fast, Matt.

01:59:25.597 --> 01:59:28.369
MATT: That it does, apparently. Anyway, welcome
back.

01:59:28.369 --> 01:59:30.018
LAURA: I think that was the best one I've ever
heard, though, Ashley.

01:59:30.018 --> 01:59:31.189
That was a really good one.

01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:33.424
MATT: You may fight one later.

01:59:33.424 --> 01:59:36.642
(laughter)

01:59:36.642 --> 01:59:46.216
MATT: So as you guys rested for the evening and
found yourself the following morning, presenting

01:59:46.216 --> 01:59:52.731
the possibility of making your way into the
Shadowfell and what waits for you there. You come

01:59:52.731 --> 01:59:57.011
to consciousness, you have your morning meal, you
begin to plot and plan. What do you wish to do?

01:59:57.011 --> 02:00:00.999
MARISHA: Go find Eskil.

02:00:00.999 --> 02:00:04.617
LAURA: Go find Eskil. Somebody else is going to go
find out from him, right?

02:00:04.617 --> 02:00:11.040
MATT: He's actually eating out in the garden. He
has one of the little tables set out there. It's a

02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:16.060
nice morning out in Whitestone right now. It's
chilly, but the clouds have broken a bit. You can

02:00:16.060 --> 02:00:19.572
see some blue skies; a little bit of sun's
breaking through. He's out there with Jecht, his

02:00:19.572 --> 02:00:27.404
associate, who's in the process of cutting his
food for him while Eskil's sitting there, still

02:00:27.404 --> 02:00:32.525
looking through books and occasionally reaching
over and plucking things from his plate to eat. As

02:00:32.525 --> 02:00:36.599
you approach him, he doesn't even look up. He
goes, "Yes? What do you require?"

02:00:36.599 --> 02:00:39.231
MARISHA: Good morning.

02:00:39.231 --> 02:00:42.058
MATT: "Good morning to you, as well, I suppose."

02:00:42.058 --> 02:00:45.135
MARISHA: Lovely weather today, isn't it?

02:00:45.135 --> 02:00:47.230
MATT: "It is weather, yes."

02:00:47.230 --> 02:00:52.045
MARISHA: So! How's the research on the Shadowfell
going?

02:00:52.045 --> 02:00:55.990
MATT: "It's done. I've researched it. I don't know
what you require."

02:00:55.990 --> 02:00:59.691
MARISHA: All of it. All of the research?

02:00:59.691 --> 02:01:04.027
MATT: "As much as is in the tomes I have at my
disposal, yes."

02:01:04.089 --> 02:01:13.029
MARISHA: Anything we should know? Anything
important? Fill us in a little bit? Spark Notes?

02:01:13.029 --> 02:01:23.513
MATT: "It's a plane of negative energy, and
elements of it are used to funnel the transition

02:01:23.513 --> 02:01:32.521
"of souls from life to death or back. A number of
it is scourged by undeath and those that skirt

02:01:32.521 --> 02:01:40.011
"that process. It exists as a mirror plane, much
like the Feywild. There are elements that resemble

02:01:40.011 --> 02:01:50.377
"Exandria, but twisted, shifted. It is a very
barren, very broken, dust-filled, dark-- not a

02:01:50.377 --> 02:01:52.037
"very pleasant place, really."

02:01:52.037 --> 02:01:53.638
LIAM: And chock-full of undead, you said?

02:01:53.638 --> 02:01:55.713
MATT: "Elements of it, yes."

02:01:55.713 --> 02:02:01.451
MARISHA: Used to transport souls? Give me a
second.

02:02:01.451 --> 02:02:07.096
LIAM: Sorry, she carries this book around. She's
very precise with her notes.

02:02:07.096 --> 02:02:10.016
MATT: "Good. You should be. Precision is
recommended."

02:02:10.016 --> 02:02:18.842
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to show him the necklace
that we found. This seems to have a slight magical

02:02:18.842 --> 02:02:23.595
attunement to the Shadowfell. Do you think I could
use this as a plane-shifting device?

02:02:23.595 --> 02:02:33.287
MATT: "It would need some alteration. It's
possible. Very careful alteration. You need it to

02:02:33.287 --> 02:02:41.368
"be a very narrow fork in order to properly channel
the spell, and this does not quite match the

02:02:41.368 --> 02:02:47.781
"proper division of magical energies. It could be
physically altered to do so, but too much and you

02:02:47.781 --> 02:02:50.290
"ruin the minor enchantment and attunement."

02:02:50.290 --> 02:02:52.019
MARISHA: All right. That's very good to know.

02:02:52.019 --> 02:02:53.269
LIAM: But doable?

02:02:53.269 --> 02:02:55.308
MARISHA: With how much time?

02:02:55.308 --> 02:03:00.094
MATT: "I don't know. I'm no metalworker. I imagine
not too much."

02:03:00.094 --> 02:03:07.797
MARISHA: Okay. Are you able to send messages? You
have Sending, yeah?

02:03:07.797 --> 02:03:17.681
MATT: He leans back, looking slightly offended. "I
have means to communicate with individuals of

02:03:17.681 --> 02:03:19.393
"importance, yes."

02:03:19.393 --> 02:03:26.726
MARISHA: Just wondering if you could tell my dad
that I might be gone for a long time?

02:03:26.726 --> 02:03:30.526
MATT: "I have absolutely no interest in any of
what you just said."

02:03:30.526 --> 02:03:37.953
MARISHA: I'd really owe you one, Eskil. Just a
quick message?

02:03:37.953 --> 02:03:42.481
MATT: "I'm not a messenger service for
individuals' parental units."

02:03:42.481 --> 02:03:49.339
LIAM: Well, we are potentially going to throw
ourselves at the greatest evil that this world has

02:03:49.339 --> 02:03:54.109
ever known, in the hopes that the entire world can
survive, so that's a big favor. That's a big gimme

02:03:54.109 --> 02:03:59.205
for you. So maybe in exchange for that, you could
send a little message.

02:03:59.205 --> 02:04:03.396
MARISHA: Just to my dad to let him know that I
might die attempting to--

02:04:03.396 --> 02:04:05.566
MATT: "Who's your father?"

02:04:05.566 --> 02:04:12.044
MARISHA: Korren of the Ashari, who is one of the
headmasters.

02:04:12.044 --> 02:04:16.756
MATT: "Right, of the wind people. Whatever. Right,
okay."

02:04:16.756 --> 02:04:20.192
LIAM: Who is your daddy, and what does he do?

02:04:20.192 --> 02:04:22.833
(laughter)

02:04:22.833 --> 02:04:27.207
MATT: He thinks for a second. Begins to run his
finger in the air, and you watch as there's a

02:04:27.207 --> 02:04:37.226
faint scrolling of soft bluish-white light. (poof)
Turns to smoke and vanishes. "All right, he knows

02:04:37.226 --> 02:04:40.356
"you're going to be off doing stuff in the
Shadowfell and probably won't be back for a while."

02:04:40.356 --> 02:04:42.191
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:04:42.191 --> 02:04:43.628
MATT: "You're welcome."

02:04:43.628 --> 02:04:53.354
MARISHA: Can we maybe borrow your research notes
on the Shadowfell? Is that a thing? No? (sighs)

02:04:53.354 --> 02:04:56.593
MATT: (thud)

02:04:56.593 --> 02:04:57.792
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:04:57.792 --> 02:04:59.607
LIAM: Seriously, thank you.

02:04:59.607 --> 02:05:01.060
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:03.854
MATT: "You're welcome. I will call into this favor
later."

02:05:03.854 --> 02:05:09.249
MARISHA: Sure. You know where to find us. What?

02:05:09.249 --> 02:05:10.304
LIAM: Nothing.

02:05:10.304 --> 02:05:13.268
MARISHA: All right. Enjoy your tea and biscuits.

02:05:13.268 --> 02:05:16.810
MATT: "I will."

02:05:16.810 --> 02:05:18.797
MARISHA: Thanks, Eskil.

02:05:18.797 --> 02:05:20.520
LIAM: Are they sweet or savory?

02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:21.830
MATT: "They're delicious."

02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:22.873
LIAM: I grab one.

02:05:22.873 --> 02:05:24.394
MATT: (frustrated noise)

02:05:24.394 --> 02:05:35.268
LAURA: While that was going on, is that caravan
still in town that was coming through? We've only

02:05:35.268 --> 02:05:36.514
been gone a day.

02:05:36.514 --> 02:05:37.872
MATT: It's still in town.

02:05:37.872 --> 02:05:44.644
LAURA: Are there any fancy fucking chalices that I
could fucking buy for a Heroes' Feast?

02:05:44.644 --> 02:05:46.829
MATT: (laughs)

02:05:46.829 --> 02:05:49.306
LIAM: Whitestone is made of fancy chalices, isn't
it, Percy?

02:05:49.306 --> 02:05:51.468
TALIESIN: We have a chalice room.

02:05:51.468 --> 02:05:57.371
MATT: I will say, if you're spending a good
portion of the morning going around, asking. Being

02:05:57.371 --> 02:06:04.320
your charismatic self and well-versed in gathering
information in a marketplace, you do find two

02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:08.639
chalices for sale that would match the
specifications required to cast a Heroes' Feast.

02:06:08.639 --> 02:06:10.982
TALIESIN: Hey. Do you want to buy a chalice?

02:06:10.982 --> 02:06:12.622
LAURA: Fabulous!

02:06:12.622 --> 02:06:15.838
MATT: "The finest chalices this side of Wildemount.
It's crazy."

02:06:15.838 --> 02:06:18.095
TALIESIN: Sipping cups. What do you need?

02:06:18.095 --> 02:06:19.996
LIAM: One of them is super gauche.

02:06:19.996 --> 02:06:26.820
MATT: "This one has an anti-dribble chinnage. For
all those nights you're drinking too hard and you

02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:29.218
"don't want to spill all over your front pouch?"

02:06:29.218 --> 02:06:31.138
LAURA: Do you have a sippy cup lid, though?

02:06:31.138 --> 02:06:34.307
MATT: "That will cost you extra."

02:06:34.307 --> 02:06:35.925
LAURA: How much?

02:06:35.925 --> 02:06:40.173
MATT: "Five gold, for the sippy cup."

02:06:40.173 --> 02:06:43.835
SAM: Is this fancy enough for a Heroes' Feast?

02:06:43.835 --> 02:06:45.650
LAURA: How much for the cup?

02:06:45.650 --> 02:06:51.592
MATT: "Each cup, because these traveled quite a
bit. They'll bring you about 1,200 gold pieces."

02:06:51.592 --> 02:06:53.723
LAURA: 1,200 gold pieces.

02:06:53.723 --> 02:06:54.887
MARISHA: Apiece, or total?

02:06:54.887 --> 02:06:56.387
MATT: "Apiece."

02:06:56.387 --> 02:07:01.595
LIAM: Why is the school crossing guard from my
hometown in New Jersey in Whitestone right now?

02:07:01.595 --> 02:07:04.466
MATT: "Hey, you think I haven't been busy after
you left school?"

02:07:04.466 --> 02:07:07.676
(laughter)

02:07:07.676 --> 02:07:09.653
LIAM: Everybody in Weehawken is like, what
happened to Larry?

02:07:09.653 --> 02:07:13.073
MATT: "Found a new occupation: chalice
collector."

02:07:13.073 --> 02:07:16.570
TALIESIN: What am I going to do with all these
chalices?

02:07:16.570 --> 02:07:18.560
MATT: "Actually..."

02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:27.617
LAURA: Well, Larry. You know that these chalices
are probably going to be used to save the world.

02:07:27.617 --> 02:07:30.822
MATT: "That sounds like a perfect reason to buy
them."

02:07:30.822 --> 02:07:35.926
LAURA: It does, doesn't it? And just think how
wonderful it will be when you can tell everyone

02:07:35.926 --> 02:07:41.249
that you sell to that you sold the things that
saved the world to Vox Machina.

02:07:41.249 --> 02:07:45.429
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:07:45.429 --> 02:07:50.560
LAURA: It wasn't a one. Persuasion, 19.

02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:58.894
MATT: "Vox Machina, you say? You know these
folks?"

02:07:58.894 --> 02:08:01.777
LAURA: Lady Vex'ahlia, at your service.

02:08:01.777 --> 02:08:11.954
MATT: His eye widens on one side. "Well, I've not
really seen or know much about you folks, but I've

02:08:11.954 --> 02:08:15.135
"heard tales of you."

02:08:15.135 --> 02:08:18.794
LAURA: I turn and show him the scales from the
Chroma Conclave.

02:08:18.794 --> 02:08:30.073
MATT: "That real dragon? No shit. Well, I mean,
tell you what." He pulls out a piece of paper and

02:08:30.073 --> 02:08:34.925
starts scrawling on it. He pulls out his inkwell
and starts dipping it. "If you would do the honor

02:08:34.925 --> 02:08:39.859
"of signing this official document that says that
these were sold to none other than Lady Vex'ahlia

02:08:39.859 --> 02:08:45.199
"of Vox Machina that I can use as proof of this
transaction for my own promotional purposes, I'll

02:08:45.199 --> 02:08:47.885
"be happy to give you both of these--"

02:08:47.885 --> 02:08:51.387
LAURA: This is my favorite shop on the Citadel.

02:08:51.387 --> 02:08:54.504
TALIESIN: This is the equivalent of the head shot
on the wall.

02:08:54.504 --> 02:09:00.521
MATT: Yeah, basically. "I will happily give you
both of these at a discount of 1,000 gold pieces apiece."

02:09:00.521 --> 02:09:05.365
LAURA: I like your style. Can I insight and make
sure this isn't some sort of

02:09:05.365 --> 02:09:07.020
enchanted piece of fucking--

02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:09.529
MATT: Sure, go for it.

02:09:09.529 --> 02:09:12.659
LAURA: What would I add to that?

02:09:12.659 --> 02:09:14.187
MATT: Your insight.

02:09:14.187 --> 02:09:17.877
LAURA: Okay, see if he's full of shit. 14?

02:09:17.877 --> 02:09:19.707
MATT: 14? Hard to read.

02:09:19.707 --> 02:09:23.031
(laughter)

02:09:23.031 --> 02:09:25.608
LAURA: You know what? Fuck it. We're probably
going to die, anyway.

02:09:25.608 --> 02:09:37.993
MATT: "A pleasure doing business with you,
milady." Hands you the two chalices. They're

02:09:37.993 --> 02:09:44.060
beautiful. One's more reddish gem-encrusted. The
other has a platinum spiral that runs around the

02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:46.420
base of it. They're both beautiful and intricate.

02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:49.217
LAURA: And you just threw the sippy cup lid as a
little--

02:09:49.217 --> 02:09:50.872
MATT: "Yeah, okay."

02:09:50.872 --> 02:09:54.757
TALIESIN: For the chalice on the go.

02:09:54.757 --> 02:09:59.011
LIAM: Now stay in school, Liam. Stay in school.

02:09:59.011 --> 02:10:06.815
MATT: "Wait, that guy looks familiar." I forgot to
also say we have a winner, by the way. Kiajade.

02:10:06.815 --> 02:10:11.704
Congratulations. I should have mentioned that. I
got caught up in the story. Thank god that's never

02:10:11.704 --> 02:10:17.178
happened before. But congratulations. All right.
You've acquired your chalices. What other business

02:10:17.178 --> 02:10:18.762
do you guys want to take care of?

02:10:18.762 --> 02:10:25.118
TALIESIN: I'm going to make sure I have enough
powder and shot for a bit of a jaunt, so I'm going

02:10:25.118 --> 02:10:31.507
into the stores of what we make here and
reloading. I'm also going to try and make some

02:10:31.507 --> 02:10:33.508
silver shot. I've never tried it before.

02:10:33.508 --> 02:10:35.612
MATT: Okay.

02:10:35.612 --> 02:10:40.329
TALIESIN: Not a ton. I want to try and make 12. I
want to see if I can make 12.

02:10:40.329 --> 02:10:45.247
MATT: Make a tinkering check. Dexterity. Well, no.
This would be intelligence.

02:10:45.247 --> 02:10:46.683
TALIESIN: It's intelligence?

02:10:46.683 --> 02:10:49.283
MATT: It's a new concept you're trying.

02:10:49.283 --> 02:10:54.142
TALIESIN: Intelligence check.

02:10:54.142 --> 02:10:56.391
MATT: Plus your proficiency.

02:10:56.391 --> 02:11:01.516
TALIESIN: Plus my proficiency. That's 19.

02:11:01.516 --> 02:11:11.324
MATT: 19? Sure. You manage to make about 12 pieces
of silver shot. You know, for the most part,

02:11:11.324 --> 02:11:14.959
because it's not as hard as other forms, it's
going to be...

02:11:14.959 --> 02:11:18.373
but it is susceptible to enchantment.

02:11:18.373 --> 02:11:24.780
TALIESIN: Which is why I was going to then take
those to Pike. I don't entirely understand how

02:11:24.780 --> 02:11:32.052
this works, but I had an idea. And I show her the
12 silver bearings, basically. Would you know how

02:11:32.052 --> 02:11:34.677
to bless something like this?

02:11:34.677 --> 02:11:37.075
ASHLEY: I could certainly try.

02:11:37.075 --> 02:11:44.268
TALIESIN: I think this might come in handy. It's a
wild idea. I don't know. I'm trying to think of

02:11:44.268 --> 02:11:48.179
surprising her with something.

02:11:48.179 --> 02:11:51.753
ASHLEY: I think that's actually a fantastic idea.

02:11:51.753 --> 02:11:58.944
TALIESIN: They're a bit hard to make, and they may
just not be useful at all, but I thought... I

02:11:58.944 --> 02:12:01.463
don't know how any of this works.

02:12:01.463 --> 02:12:07.819
ASHLEY: I'll see what I can do. Yeah. I'll see
what I can do.

02:12:07.819 --> 02:12:09.764
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:12:09.764 --> 02:12:14.279
MATT: Okay. You take the silver shot. Anyone want
to try anything else?

02:12:14.279 --> 02:12:19.261
LAURA: Yeah. I want to buy some holy oil, or get
some holy oil from the church, or something.

02:12:19.261 --> 02:12:21.547
(laughter) Where do I get holy oil?

02:12:21.547 --> 02:12:23.229
SAM: From the church.

02:12:23.229 --> 02:12:27.084
LAURA: We've gotten holy oil before. I just can't
remember from where.

02:12:27.084 --> 02:12:29.314
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:12:29.314 --> 02:12:34.126
LAURA: 21.

02:12:34.126 --> 02:12:40.361
MATT: 21. "You look like you're looking for
something to buy."

02:12:40.361 --> 02:12:45.314
LAURA: Oh, really? Larry, do you have any holy
oil?

02:12:45.314 --> 02:12:56.543
MATT: "My lady. Do I? I happen to have one vial of
holy oil, good for two applications."

02:12:56.543 --> 02:12:58.672
LAURA: All right. That's it? Just one?

02:12:58.672 --> 02:13:03.182
MATT: "Traveled a long way, and you're a little
late in the shopping day. I was all full on them,

02:13:03.182 --> 02:13:05.685
"but they've been flying off the shelf. My
apologies."

02:13:05.685 --> 02:13:06.967
LAURA: Skeletons everywhere.

02:13:06.967 --> 02:13:09.789
ASHLEY: Vex, I have some holy oil?

02:13:09.789 --> 02:13:11.334
LAURA: How much?

02:13:11.334 --> 02:13:16.607
ASHLEY: I don't know. I just have a vial of it. I
don't know how much that is.

02:13:16.607 --> 02:13:19.429
LAURA: That's good for two applications, I think.

02:13:19.429 --> 02:13:21.048
ASHLEY: Probably good for two applications.

02:13:21.048 --> 02:13:23.199
MATT: Three applications with the vial that you
have.

02:13:23.199 --> 02:13:27.255
LAURA: Oh, this one has a little bit missing? How
much? Because this is less than it normally is.

02:13:27.255 --> 02:13:32.193
MATT: "Look, you've already done some good
business with me. I'll give it to you for 150."

02:13:32.193 --> 02:13:34.927
SAM: But you have to sign this poster.

02:13:34.927 --> 02:13:37.693
(laughter)

02:13:37.693 --> 02:13:40.147
ASHLEY: For my Hawaiian poke bowl mascot.

02:13:40.147 --> 02:13:42.583
(laughter)

02:13:42.622 --> 02:13:46.115
TRAVIS: I would eat there all the time.

02:13:46.115 --> 02:14:01.795
LAURA: 150 gold. Sure. Only because Percy gave me
a look. You know what-- yeah, okay.

02:14:01.795 --> 02:14:03.182
MATT: All right.

02:14:03.182 --> 02:14:05.449
TALIESIN: She's going to keep trying to listen to
one word.

02:14:05.449 --> 02:14:07.235
MARISHA: A lot to unpack here.

02:14:07.235 --> 02:14:13.024
MATT: I'm not hearing music. We'll check that in a
second. Anybody else want to prepare anything?

02:14:13.024 --> 02:14:17.492
LIAM: Yeah. I want to track down Kynan for a
minute.

02:14:17.492 --> 02:14:24.561
MATT: Okay. You find him. It's early morning.
They've finished their early round of training for

02:14:24.561 --> 02:14:29.772
the morning, and some of the early Pale Guard
recruits are in the process of rushing off and

02:14:29.772 --> 02:14:35.975
taking a small lunch break. He's currently taking
a lot of the equipment from the training grounds

02:14:35.975 --> 02:14:43.160
and setting it aside in the various weapon racks,
and generally cleaning up the space as you

02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:47.317
approach. He looks over his shoulder as he sets
some of the practice blades along the edge.

02:14:47.317 --> 02:14:50.115
LIAM: Hey, brother man. How's all?

02:14:50.115 --> 02:15:00.396
MATT: "Good. All's well. Just keeping things
going. Got a lot of good up-and-coming folks."

02:15:00.396 --> 02:15:03.145
LIAM: You got all these ladies and gentlemen in
shape?

02:15:03.145 --> 02:15:05.016
MATT: "Working on it. It's a process."

02:15:05.016 --> 02:15:08.921
LIAM: I don't want to take up a lot of your time.
We just got in, and we're heading out again.

02:15:08.921 --> 02:15:18.137
Anyway, I'm glad that I have Simon back, but I
feel bad because I gave it to you and I took it

02:15:18.137 --> 02:15:25.691
away. But we're leaving, and I want to travel
light, so I wanted to make it up to you. I have

02:15:25.691 --> 02:15:34.924
this. I'm going to give you this dagger. It's the
Keen Dagger. Take this. It's too much; I can't use

02:15:34.924 --> 02:15:47.569
it. I've got this thing. Anyway. Just hold onto
it. That's it.

02:15:47.569 --> 02:15:55.974
MATT: "Thank you very much. I'll keep it at my
side." He takes the basic dagger out of his sheath

02:15:55.974 --> 02:15:58.243
and chucks it into the corner.

02:15:58.243 --> 02:16:07.087
LIAM: Yeah. That one's better. And thanks, and I
think Percy's thankful, too. I think. You're doing

02:16:07.087 --> 02:16:09.056
really good work here.

02:16:09.056 --> 02:16:11.234
MATT: "Thank you. Thank you very much."

02:16:11.234 --> 02:16:14.241
LIAM: Long, twisted road, but look where we are.
Look where you are.

02:16:14.241 --> 02:16:18.655
MATT: "There's still a ways to go."

02:16:18.655 --> 02:16:20.111
LIAM: Pat, pat.

02:16:20.111 --> 02:16:21.277
LAURA: Pat, pat where?

02:16:21.277 --> 02:16:22.730
LIAM: On his dick, obviously.

02:16:22.730 --> 02:16:24.623
(laughter)

02:16:24.623 --> 02:16:28.538
TRAVIS: The open palm?

02:16:28.538 --> 02:16:38.078
LIAM: On his cheek. That's it. Anyway, you're
busy. We'll see you soon.

02:16:38.078 --> 02:16:42.299
MATT: "I look forward to it. Stay safe."

02:16:42.299 --> 02:16:45.735
LIAM: I will. Keep up the good work. (whoosh)

02:16:45.735 --> 02:16:47.505
MATT: All right.

02:16:47.505 --> 02:16:58.799
SAM: I guess Taryon will go find Vex. Stumble up
and say, I have to stay here and keep working on

02:16:58.799 --> 02:17:01.230
Doty. I understand you're leaving today.

02:17:01.230 --> 02:17:02.715
LAURA: You're not going to come with us?

02:17:02.715 --> 02:17:09.773
SAM: I cannot. I have to stay and fix Doty and get
back to my home. I'm sorry. It's been a pleasure.

02:17:09.773 --> 02:17:11.925
LAURA: Don't say it's been a pleasure!

02:17:11.925 --> 02:17:18.938
SAM: It's been an honor to have your acquaintance,
and I'm afraid I have to return, but perhaps we'll

02:17:18.938 --> 02:17:21.080
meet again sometime.

02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:30.807
LAURA: I give him a big old hug. And I give
him...

02:17:30.807 --> 02:17:32.791
LIAM: Three copper.

02:17:32.791 --> 02:17:37.757
LAURA: I give him-- I don't have any feathers
left, I don't think.

02:17:37.757 --> 02:17:39.446
SAM: Do you have any money?

02:17:39.446 --> 02:17:41.915
(laughter)

02:17:41.915 --> 02:17:43.834
LAURA: I have no money, Tary.

02:17:43.834 --> 02:17:45.085
SAM: I need money.

02:17:45.085 --> 02:17:48.055
TALIESIN: Technically speaking, you've been on
salary.

02:17:48.055 --> 02:17:57.790
SAM: How about this? I wrote you a check. Can you
rip it up? I don't think I can pay it, ever.

02:17:57.790 --> 02:18:01.746
(laughter)

02:18:01.746 --> 02:18:05.322
LAURA: Tary, I ripped it up about two weeks after
you moved in.

02:18:05.322 --> 02:18:10.250
SAM: Thank you. And you have no other money on
you?

02:18:10.250 --> 02:18:16.531
LAURA: I open up my pouch, and I've got zero
personal gold. Just party funds.

02:18:16.531 --> 02:18:23.144
SAM: Well, I feel like I should leave you with all
of my belongings, and all of my magical items, but

02:18:23.144 --> 02:18:32.890
I need them for my brigade. I'll leave you with
the seashell crown that who gave me? Grog?

02:18:32.890 --> 02:18:33.991
LAURA: Percy.

02:18:33.991 --> 02:18:35.591
SAM: Percy gave me.

02:18:35.591 --> 02:18:37.823
LAURA: I think he'd want you to have that.

02:18:37.823 --> 02:18:45.421
SAM: Do you want the half of a geode rock with 30
living souls inside of it?

02:18:45.421 --> 02:18:49.188
LAURA: Yeah, give it to me. Thanks, friend.

02:18:49.188 --> 02:18:51.537
SAM: I can't use it.

02:18:51.537 --> 02:18:54.438
LAURA: 30-soul rock. Got it.

02:18:54.438 --> 02:18:57.862
MARISHA: 30 Rock Soul? (giggles)

02:18:57.862 --> 02:19:02.484
TRAVIS: 30 souls just sitting in a rock. You think
my shit's weird?

02:19:02.484 --> 02:19:05.170
SAM: Maybe I should have shown that to Pike
sometime in the last year?

02:19:05.170 --> 02:19:07.222
LAURA: I will show it to her.

02:19:07.222 --> 02:19:09.889
TALIESIN: That's just been sitting on your
bedside, hasn't it?

02:19:09.889 --> 02:19:11.956
Slowly making the sound of crying.

02:19:11.956 --> 02:19:17.061
MATT: If you get really close at night, you hear
this faint (screams).

02:19:17.061 --> 02:19:19.002
LAURA: Help me!

02:19:19.002 --> 02:19:21.247
MATT: He puts another pillow over it.

02:19:21.247 --> 02:19:22.734
LAURA: What is that?

02:19:22.734 --> 02:19:24.601
TALIESIN: Anything else?

02:19:24.601 --> 02:19:28.556
SAM: Do you think you'll see Percy anytime soon?

02:19:28.556 --> 02:19:30.027
LAURA: I think I might.

02:19:30.027 --> 02:19:37.472
SAM: When you do, (pink) can you give him this
little gem for his flashlight? I can't spare many,

02:19:37.472 --> 02:19:40.601
but that will give him one flashlight.

02:19:40.601 --> 02:19:42.044
LAURA: Definitely.

02:19:42.044 --> 02:19:46.103
TALIESIN: He'll have to come back, anyway, because
he doesn't know how to make the ammo for his gun.

02:19:46.103 --> 02:19:48.534
LAURA: How are you going to get Doty home?

02:19:48.534 --> 02:19:53.067
SAM: Well, after he's fixed, me and Chod--

02:19:53.067 --> 02:19:56.573
LAURA: Right. Lionel. I think he likes to be
called Lionel.

02:19:56.573 --> 02:20:03.257
SAM: I prefer Chod. I think we'll set off the
old-fashioned way.

02:20:03.257 --> 02:20:07.821
LAURA: See who you pick up along the way?

02:20:07.821 --> 02:20:11.013
SAM: Ooh! That could be chapter one of the new
book.

02:20:11.013 --> 02:20:12.151
LAURA: Exactly.

02:20:12.151 --> 02:20:16.887
SAM: Yes. A New Hope. Something like that.

02:20:16.887 --> 02:20:19.538
LAURA: I like it. It's epic. Catchy.

02:20:19.538 --> 02:20:26.925
SAM: Yes. Well, I'm not going to say have fun,
because you're going to a terrible place.

02:20:26.925 --> 02:20:30.415
LAURA: We might not make it out alive. If you talk
to my brother, that's what he says.

02:20:30.415 --> 02:20:31.866
He says it every time.

02:20:31.866 --> 02:20:33.732
LIAM: I never said that.

02:20:33.732 --> 02:20:42.323
SAM: If you die, I will be very upset. Hey, if I
die, your thing will glow, so that will be good.

02:20:42.323 --> 02:20:44.092
LAURA: Same. So we'll know.

02:20:44.092 --> 02:20:47.112
SAM: I'll see you sometime in Wildemount?

02:20:47.112 --> 02:20:49.083
LAURA: Of course we'll come visit you.

02:20:49.083 --> 02:20:50.215
SAM: All right.

02:20:50.215 --> 02:20:51.551
LAURA: I love you so much.

02:20:51.551 --> 02:20:56.685
SAM: You, too. Take care of your hair. You know,
you shouldn't wash it as often as you do. It just

02:20:56.685 --> 02:20:58.155
makes it dry and flaky.

02:20:58.155 --> 02:21:01.392
LAURA: The oil is helpful. Thank you.

02:21:01.392 --> 02:21:04.061
SAM: Get it trimmed every two weeks.

02:21:04.061 --> 02:21:05.495
LAURA: Right.

02:21:05.495 --> 02:21:07.217
SAM: And have someone comb it.

02:21:07.217 --> 02:21:10.700
LAURA: Yeah, I probably should do that, huh?

02:21:10.700 --> 02:21:12.398
SAM: It's really disgusting sometimes.

02:21:12.398 --> 02:21:17.291
LAURA: Okay. I'll brush it a hundred brush strokes
every night, just like you.

02:21:17.291 --> 02:21:23.344
SAM: Thank you. All right. Goodbye. I'll see you
soon, Little Elf Girl.

02:21:23.344 --> 02:21:29.881
LAURA: Bye, Goldie. (fake-cries)

02:21:29.881 --> 02:21:35.218
MATT: All right, so what do you wish to do, guys?

02:21:35.218 --> 02:21:43.605
ASHLEY: Is there a way that I can bless these
bullets?

02:21:43.605 --> 02:21:48.959
TALIESIN: They're musket balls, technically.
They're not bullets.

02:21:48.959 --> 02:21:55.886
MATT: It will take you a while to do so. You could
temporarily bless them with the Bless spell, but

02:21:55.886 --> 02:22:01.293
to infuse them with the blessing would be the
equivalent of a small enchantment, so it would

02:22:01.293 --> 02:22:05.207
take you a couple of days or something.

02:22:05.207 --> 02:22:18.408
ASHLEY: Well, I could start it, depending on when
we leave, I guess. I have Bless. I was looking at

02:22:18.408 --> 02:22:21.524
that, but I didn't know I could use that on actual
objects, other than people.

02:22:21.524 --> 02:22:26.410
TALIESIN: We also have to modify one of the
necklaces.

02:22:26.410 --> 02:22:30.351
LAURA: Yeah. That needs to go to a blacksmith, or
something?

02:22:30.351 --> 02:22:36.171
MARISHA: Unless we want to go through the
old-fashioned way like the cultists did.

02:22:36.171 --> 02:22:38.155
LIAM: The old-fashioned way?

02:22:38.155 --> 02:22:40.609
LAURA: We can't Plane Shift unless we alter the
necklace.

02:22:40.609 --> 02:22:43.537
TALIESIN: But we have enough necklaces that we
could just jump through.

02:22:43.537 --> 02:22:44.880
TRAVIS: That one.

02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:47.630
MARISHA: We might take a little bit of damage on
the way through.

02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:48.981
TRAVIS: I'm game.

02:22:48.981 --> 02:22:51.318
LAURA: You have a bajillion health points.

02:22:51.318 --> 02:22:55.588
TRAVIS: I also thought of something overnight. All
right? It hurt, because it's kind of brilliant.

02:22:55.588 --> 02:23:02.710
Can you hold your breath for-- (whispering) what's
higher than ten?

02:23:02.710 --> 02:23:04.325
ASHLEY: (whispering) 11.

02:23:04.325 --> 02:23:06.196
TRAVIS: 11 seconds.

02:23:06.196 --> 02:23:07.216
SAM: Sure.

02:23:07.216 --> 02:23:08.301
LAURA: Why?

02:23:08.301 --> 02:23:13.287
TRAVIS: Why don't all you bitches just hop in the
Bag of Holding, I jump through, take all the

02:23:13.287 --> 02:23:16.638
damage for us, and then you just (popping sounds)
pop right back out?

02:23:16.638 --> 02:23:20.762
TALIESIN: I can think of many reasons why that's
probably not a good idea.

02:23:20.762 --> 02:23:23.055
TRAVIS: What could it possibly be?

02:23:23.055 --> 02:23:30.445
TALIESIN: The Bag of Holding is a negative space.
It's not designed to sustain life.

02:23:30.445 --> 02:23:32.031
TRAVIS: Have you ever been in one?

02:23:32.031 --> 02:23:35.942
TALIESIN: Very specifically not, because things
die in there.

02:23:35.942 --> 02:23:41.572
LIAM: Grog, think of all the things you've pulled
out of there that look like sloppy joes, when they

02:23:41.572 --> 02:23:43.227
didn't look like that going in.

02:23:43.227 --> 02:23:46.729
LAURA: Let's put something living inside of there
and wait ten seconds and then take it out and see

02:23:46.729 --> 02:23:48.094
if it's still alive.

02:23:48.094 --> 02:23:50.752
TRAVIS: But it has to be able to hold its breath.
If we throw a dog in there--

02:23:50.752 --> 02:23:53.422
ASHLEY: So if it breathes, it will die.

02:23:53.422 --> 02:23:55.999
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's no air, I don't think.

02:23:55.999 --> 02:24:02.612
LAURA: If it's ten seconds and it's not knowing to
hold its breath, it will come out alive, still.

02:24:02.612 --> 02:24:04.966
TRAVIS: If you want to do CPR, whatever.

02:24:04.966 --> 02:24:09.814
TALIESIN: What if the things inside take the
damage even if they are in the Bag of Holding?

02:24:09.814 --> 02:24:11.596
TRAVIS: We should find out. Are you going in?

02:24:11.596 --> 02:24:12.801
TALIESIN: No.

02:24:12.801 --> 02:24:13.732
TRAVIS: I'll go in.

02:24:13.732 --> 02:24:18.408
ASHLEY: You stick your hand in there all the time.
No?

02:24:18.408 --> 02:24:22.043
TALIESIN: This is not a magic you want to be
messing around with.

02:24:22.043 --> 02:24:24.809
TRAVIS: All right. I just wanted to put it out
there. We can all take the stones and go through.

02:24:24.809 --> 02:24:27.460
I bet it's not going to be that bad of a deal.

02:24:27.460 --> 02:24:31.648
TALIESIN: No, this is the fantasy equivalent of locking
yourself in a refrigerator.

02:24:31.648 --> 02:24:37.618
TRAVIS: Just wanted to put it out there if you
wanted to live on the edge of life, but no, we'll

02:24:37.618 --> 02:24:39.392
just do it the boring way.

02:24:39.392 --> 02:24:43.323
TALIESIN: I feel comfortable with the level of
risk-taking of jumping into a giant sphere that

02:24:43.323 --> 02:24:44.778
crushes anything it touches.

02:24:44.778 --> 02:24:47.513
MARISHA: It's definitely a large amount of
risk-taking already.

02:24:47.513 --> 02:24:54.668
LAURA: Can anybody tell if this plate is cursed?
Can you tell if something's cursed, bro?

02:24:54.668 --> 02:24:55.816
SAM: Oh, the armor?

02:24:55.816 --> 02:24:56.987
LIAM: No.

02:24:56.987 --> 02:24:58.951
LAURA: Can you tell if something is cursed, Pike?

02:24:58.951 --> 02:25:07.131
ASHLEY: I could try. Can I check it out and see if
it's cursed?

02:25:07.131 --> 02:25:16.553
TRAVIS: That is a face that says, I'm giving you
nothing. (groans) Garlic chicken.

02:25:16.553 --> 02:25:21.072
LAURA: Gross. Were you the one burping earlier,
too?

02:25:21.072 --> 02:25:22.527
TRAVIS: I blew it that way, though.

02:25:22.527 --> 02:25:25.982
LAURA: Yeah, but somebody burped in the first half
of the game, and it was foul.

02:25:25.982 --> 02:25:27.449
TRAVIS: It's probably me.

02:25:27.449 --> 02:25:32.283
TALIESIN: Careful where you aim that. You might
break a camera.

02:25:32.283 --> 02:25:35.255
SAM: Let's go. Let's move!

02:25:35.255 --> 02:25:38.477
LAURA: I'm trying to figure out if this plate mail
is cursed or not.

02:25:38.477 --> 02:25:40.567
SAM: Who the fuck cares? We're going to a cursed
place.

02:25:40.567 --> 02:25:42.762
LAURA: No, but it's so we can put it on somebody
here.

02:25:42.762 --> 02:25:46.315
TALIESIN: Let's grab a bit of funds. Do we have
the group funds, as well?

02:25:46.315 --> 02:25:47.866
We have access to the group funds.

02:25:47.866 --> 02:25:49.518
SAM: You think one plate armor's going to do
anything?

02:25:49.518 --> 02:25:53.096
MARISHA: Scanlan's back.

02:25:53.096 --> 02:25:55.123
TRAVIS: Let's go.

02:25:55.123 --> 02:25:56.540
LIAM: Guess who's back?

02:25:56.540 --> 02:25:58.653
MARISHA: Hang on. Do we want to do a Heroes'
Feast?

02:25:58.653 --> 02:25:59.839
TALIESIN: Not yet.

02:25:59.839 --> 02:26:03.112
LAURA: Yeah, 'cause what if something's waiting for
us on the other side?

02:26:03.112 --> 02:26:04.501
TALIESIN: What if nothing's waiting for us on the
other side?

02:26:04.501 --> 02:26:05.919
Because now we're down one Heroes' Feast.

02:26:05.919 --> 02:26:07.236
LAURA: Yeah, but what if there is?

02:26:07.236 --> 02:26:08.403
TRAVIS: We've got a mansion.

02:26:08.403 --> 02:26:09.888
TALIESIN: Then we dive into the mansion and we
have a Heroes' Feast.

02:26:09.888 --> 02:26:12.473
LAURA: We've got to waste a fucking minute. We've
got to protect Scanlan for a minute.

02:26:12.473 --> 02:26:13.919
TALIESIN: I think we're going to be okay.

02:26:13.919 --> 02:26:15.222
LIAM: I'm with your beau.

02:26:15.222 --> 02:26:23.071
TALIESIN: I think over-cautious. Even when jumping
into the depths of the undead, there's such a

02:26:23.071 --> 02:26:24.500
thing as over-cautious.

02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:27.347
TRAVIS: Let's go down to the ziggurat.

02:26:27.347 --> 02:26:31.132
TALIESIN: I'm putting the-- as I hit the
microphone. Do not touch your microphone when you

02:26:31.179 --> 02:26:33.332
put on your necklace. I'm putting on my necklace.

02:26:33.332 --> 02:26:35.598
LAURA: Okay, I'll put on my necklace.

02:26:35.598 --> 02:26:37.481
MATT: Each of you don one of the symbols?

02:26:37.481 --> 02:26:38.501
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:26:38.501 --> 02:26:40.315
MARISHA: Do we need to put on the robes, too, that
we found?

02:26:40.315 --> 02:26:41.870
LAURA: Fuck the robes.

02:26:41.870 --> 02:26:44.270
TALIESIN: I want them to see me coming.

02:26:44.270 --> 02:26:49.410
MARISHA: All right. Do you want the robes?

02:26:49.410 --> 02:26:51.416
LIAM: I don't feel strongly about it.

02:26:51.416 --> 02:26:53.962
TRAVIS: If we put on the robes, we've got to pull
out an eyeball each, too.

02:26:53.962 --> 02:26:57.552
ASHLEY: We're already there? We're standing at the
ball?

02:26:57.552 --> 02:27:00.438
LAURA: Are we going down? Sure.

02:27:00.438 --> 02:27:04.655
TRAVIS: We're going down to the ziggurat.

02:27:04.655 --> 02:27:11.127
MATT: All right. You find your way down into the
subterranean tunnels beneath Whitestone, winding

02:27:11.127 --> 02:27:16.610
through the caverns until you enter the chamber
that contains the ziggurat where you initially

02:27:16.610 --> 02:27:23.307
faced off with the Briarwoods. As you climb to the
top, there before you, you see standing in all of

02:27:23.307 --> 02:27:31.010
its glory, the black, as you've called it,
spinning orb of death. Approximately that large

02:27:31.010 --> 02:27:39.597
now, and it's this dark void, that as you get
close, it has this weird vibration to it. And

02:27:39.597 --> 02:27:45.190
there it is, suspended about four feet off the
ground at the top of this ziggurat.

02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:49.276
LAURA: Can I get close to it and put the necklace
near it without touching it?

02:27:49.276 --> 02:27:55.784
MATT: Yeah. You put the necklace near it, and you
watch as the sphere, this weird grayish aura

02:27:55.784 --> 02:28:03.093
around it begins to emanate faintly, almost like
the closer it gets, the brighter this weird gray

02:28:03.093 --> 02:28:05.635
aura tends to get and the wider it grows.

02:28:05.635 --> 02:28:07.094
LAURA: That seems promising.

02:28:07.094 --> 02:28:08.672
LIAM: I'm right behind you.

02:28:08.672 --> 02:28:10.258
TALIESIN: Who first?

02:28:10.258 --> 02:28:11.963
LIAM: Me. (whoosh)

02:28:11.963 --> 02:28:13.199
SAM: (screams)

02:28:13.199 --> 02:28:14.011
MATT: All right.

02:28:14.011 --> 02:28:15.213
TALIESIN: Well, that happened.

02:28:15.213 --> 02:28:16.976
MATT: I would like you to make a constitution
saving throw.

02:28:16.976 --> 02:28:21.054
MARISHA: Keyleth reaches for Vax right as he goes
in. Oh shit.

02:28:21.054 --> 02:28:25.807
LIAM: I'll use my first Luck of the day. Wasn't
that bad, but it's an important roll. That's

02:28:25.807 --> 02:28:27.856
better. 20.

02:28:27.856 --> 02:28:30.547
MATT: 20. Okay.

02:28:30.547 --> 02:28:33.966
TRAVIS: That's a lot of dice.

02:28:33.966 --> 02:28:35.750
MARISHA: Oh Jesus, that's so many dice.

02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:41.102
ASHLEY: (whispering) I thought we bamfed into it.

02:28:41.102 --> 02:28:43.783
MARISHA: He twitched again.

02:28:43.783 --> 02:28:53.791
MATT: You take 11 points of necrotic damage.
Anybody else?

02:28:53.791 --> 02:28:55.400
MARISHA: Just that? That's it?

02:28:55.400 --> 02:28:57.436
MATT: You don't know that. You just saw him
vanish.

02:28:57.436 --> 02:29:01.289
TRAVIS: I'm game. I'll go.

02:29:01.289 --> 02:29:05.375
MARISHA: All right.

02:29:05.375 --> 02:29:08.841
MATT: Everybody going in?

02:29:08.841 --> 02:29:10.114
MARISHA: Yeah, in.

02:29:10.114 --> 02:29:12.770
MATT: All right. Everyone, make a constitution
saving throw, please.

02:29:12.770 --> 02:29:19.249
SAM: Nine. No, 17.

02:29:19.249 --> 02:29:20.839
MATT: 17.

02:29:20.839 --> 02:29:22.569
TALIESIN: 23.

02:29:22.569 --> 02:29:28.480
MATT: 22 points of necrotic damage. 11 points of
necrotic damage.

02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:30.330
TRAVIS: Nine.

02:29:30.330 --> 02:29:33.934
MATT: 22 points of necrotic damage. 22 points of
necrotic damage.

02:29:33.934 --> 02:29:34.950
ASHLEY: Six.

02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:36.604
MATT: 22 points of necrotic damage.

02:29:36.604 --> 02:29:37.469
MARISHA: 16.

02:29:37.469 --> 02:29:47.461
MATT: 22 points of necrotic damage. So as you leap
into the sphere, you feel as if the gravity that

02:29:47.461 --> 02:29:52.895
holds you to the ground, or sometimes the ceiling,
bends around you and your limbs are wrenched

02:29:52.895 --> 02:29:57.761
forward, like someone has you in a full Nelson
that doesn't end. Your body is about to be

02:29:57.761 --> 02:30:04.609
condensed and crushed, when you feel the symbol
pulse, and the gravity lessens somewhat. It's

02:30:04.609 --> 02:30:09.658
still tearing into you, and you feel this coldness
and this numbness come over your body, as you feel

02:30:09.658 --> 02:30:15.463
like you're a square peg being pushed through a
round hole, physically pushed through against your

02:30:15.463 --> 02:30:22.436
will. You begin to yell out in pain instinctually
before it comes to a stop and you all land to your

02:30:22.436 --> 02:30:27.742
feet, out of breath. The numbness begins to fade
to immediate pins and needles, just pain across

02:30:27.742 --> 02:30:33.385
your entire body. You feel like someone just raked
a number of tacks across every surface of your

02:30:33.385 --> 02:30:40.174
skin and as the pain begins to throb, you can feel
the blood pulsing throughout your body as it all

02:30:40.174 --> 02:30:47.020
shoots to the surface. You still sense that you,
thanks to your symbols around your neck, you

02:30:47.020 --> 02:31:03.755
managed to withstand a much more dangerous
arrival. As your eyes focus, you already feel the

02:31:03.755 --> 02:31:11.895
chilled air that surrounds you, like a cold, cold
winter morning. The sky above is sunless and gray,

02:31:11.895 --> 02:31:19.637
like an overcast horizon without clouds to texture
it, breached by distant mountain ranges like so

02:31:19.637 --> 02:31:31.605
much broken glass. You see behind you immediately
the other corresponding siphon, floating, bright

02:31:31.605 --> 02:31:40.179
gray-white in color and glowing, the same color
that you saw briefly shifted to in the ziggurat

02:31:40.179 --> 02:31:48.898
near Ank'harel. Beneath it, you find shards of
ruined objects, piles of long-dead bodies, flesh

02:31:48.898 --> 02:31:53.667
and bone rended and twisted like they'd been put
through some rapid tornado on different sides of

02:31:53.667 --> 02:31:59.153
their body. And you see a lot of these shattered
pieces of wood and metal were all a number of

02:31:59.153 --> 02:32:02.757
objects that were thrown in here during the
experimental phase when you guys first uncovered

02:32:02.757 --> 02:32:10.862
this. You look around and notice that you stand
atop a rectangular platform of dark, smooth stone,

02:32:10.862 --> 02:32:17.287
about 15 feet on each side. Beneath the edges,
about 20 feet down, 'til it comes to the ground.

02:32:17.287 --> 02:32:23.454
So you're on an elevated stone platform that the
siphon is affixed to above, floating about four

02:32:23.454 --> 02:32:29.684
feet above the top of the surface. And you look
down to the ground immediately around you and you

02:32:29.684 --> 02:32:36.197
see just dry, cracked badlands. It seems to spread
out, making up the majority of the Shadowfell

02:32:36.197 --> 02:32:45.764
around you. Surrounding your location, your sight
clarifies to see what appears to be hundreds of

02:32:45.764 --> 02:32:54.721
buildings and structures that form this shade of
an ancient city, like a town, a sprawling village.

02:32:54.721 --> 02:33:01.423
Half the structures toppled and destroyed, piles
of rubble and rock. The ground itself seems to jut

02:33:01.423 --> 02:33:08.394
up in places, these tiny, shooting spires of black
and gray earth that the city has either been built

02:33:08.394 --> 02:33:18.917
around or seemed to have grown through. As you
look past that, you see movement throughout the

02:33:18.917 --> 02:33:24.356
streets in the distance, but before you can focus
on that, your vision immediately sticks towards,

02:33:24.356 --> 02:33:37.501
in the center of this circular-like city, the
standing, ominous, commanding, massive spire of

02:33:37.501 --> 02:33:43.960
obsidian black, familiar to both of you through
two different types of vision you've experienced.

02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:51.511
A jagged monolith that exudes ancient hatred,
encircled by dozens of dark, winged beasts that

02:33:51.511 --> 02:34:02.087
watch over the dreary skies. Who here is
proficient in history?

02:34:02.087 --> 02:34:06.508
LAURA: &lt;i&gt;Nobody&lt;/i&gt; is proficient in history?!

02:34:06.508 --> 02:34:08.430
SAM: We're doomed to repeat it.

02:34:08.430 --> 02:34:11.382
TRAVIS: Really, Percy?

02:34:11.382 --> 02:34:18.422
TALIESIN: No, I have other qualities, history was
not my forefront. I know Whitestone.

02:34:18.422 --> 02:34:22.602
SAM: Somewhere, Taryon is reading a history book.

02:34:22.602 --> 02:34:30.033
MATT: Exactly. The two of you make history checks
with disadvantage because you lack proficiency.

02:34:30.033 --> 02:34:34.805
Yes, you being a bard, you pick up information in
passing. With disadvantage, each of you.

02:34:34.805 --> 02:34:38.267
TALIESIN: Nine.

02:34:38.267 --> 02:34:39.813
SAM: 11.

02:34:39.813 --> 02:34:40.893
LAURA: Oh god.

02:34:40.893 --> 02:34:42.223
SAM: That's a bad sign.

02:34:42.223 --> 02:34:48.517
MATT: You have no inclination of where you stand
or what's before you. All you know is you stand

02:34:48.517 --> 02:34:53.164
now on the cold plane of the Shadowfell, the echo
of the Prime Material.

02:34:53.164 --> 02:34:56.838
LAURA: Our notes on the Shadowfell.

02:34:56.838 --> 02:34:58.685
MATT: You do.

02:34:58.685 --> 02:35:04.423
TALIESIN: Can we consult the Rand McNally?

02:35:04.423 --> 02:35:07.359
TRAVIS: The Rand McNally guide, yeah.

02:35:07.359 --> 02:35:10.017
MATT: You're welcome to. Just so you guys know,
you are all standing out in the middle of the

02:35:10.017 --> 02:35:14.233
open, on this large stone platform looking down in
the center of this giant city--

02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:18.283
LAURA: There are things that are moving below. I
see them.

02:35:18.354 --> 02:35:20.185
MARISHA: And the ziggurat is above us?

02:35:20.185 --> 02:35:24.520
MATT: There is no ziggurat. There is a large,
black spire, but that's in the center of the city

02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:27.323
maybe two miles off.

02:35:27.323 --> 02:35:29.973
LAURA: As we hop down, I cast Pass Without a Trace
on all of us.

02:35:29.973 --> 02:35:34.213
LIAM: There are buildings around, so are we in the
middle of a field, a plain, badlands?

02:35:34.213 --> 02:35:43.282
MATT: There are buildings. You see two structures
maybe 50 or 60 feet from you on each side, and

02:35:43.282 --> 02:35:48.457
then going forward, from your current position, it
leads right into the city. So this structure is on

02:35:48.457 --> 02:35:50.890
the outskirts. It's right on the perimeter.

02:35:50.890 --> 02:35:53.480
LAURA: Do we see any other orbs around?

02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:56.999
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:35:56.999 --> 02:35:59.711
LAURA: 25.

02:35:59.711 --> 02:36:09.705
MATT: You glance and, in the faint gray sky above
you, around the glowing white-gray orb this side

02:36:09.705 --> 02:36:20.607
of the siphon, you see a very, very faint aura of
bluish-purple that is weaving into a thread, a

02:36:20.607 --> 02:36:28.172
rope almost, various strands that knot and twist
to form a cord, a very barely visible cord that

02:36:28.172 --> 02:36:33.881
just drifts up towards the very top of that tower
for miles. And there at the top of the tower, you

02:36:33.881 --> 02:36:41.521
see a vibrant, sparking, pulsing, purple glow. And
from there, you can see two other distant strands

02:36:41.521 --> 02:36:49.109
that arc off into the very faint other edges
across, triangulating around the other sides of

02:36:49.109 --> 02:36:56.971
the outskirts of this ancient city. You see the
faint, glowing white-gray pulse of two other

02:36:56.971 --> 02:37:03.054
siphons affixed to two other platforms, all these
strands converging at the top of the tower.

02:37:03.054 --> 02:37:15.109
ASHLEY: Before we get to it, can I cast Bless on
his bullets so I can give them back to him?

02:37:15.109 --> 02:37:16.979
MATT: How long does it last?

02:37:16.979 --> 02:37:20.931
ASHLEY: Not very long.

02:37:20.931 --> 02:37:25.853
MATT: You can. There's a difference between
casting a spell and enchanting something. It's a

02:37:25.853 --> 02:37:28.972
loose enchantment to Bless the ammunition. That
takes a while to focus on.

02:37:28.972 --> 02:37:31.917
TALIESIN: I imagine it'll take a few days when
it's done.

02:37:31.917 --> 02:37:33.438
ASHLEY: When it's done.

02:37:33.438 --> 02:37:37.070
TALIESIN: I don't expect us to be in and out of
here, I think this is going to take some time.

02:37:37.070 --> 02:37:41.073
ASHLEY: I'd rather enchant them.

02:37:41.073 --> 02:37:47.169
TRAVIS: The structures to our left and our right,
are they solid, do they have focus?

02:37:47.169 --> 02:37:55.490
MATT: They're solid, they're stone buildings,
they're homes, though plain and cracked. There are

02:37:55.490 --> 02:38:05.732
sections of wall missing in places. As you look
about the grounds here, and you know this because

02:38:05.732 --> 02:38:14.701
you've ransacked and been responsible for the
ransacking... or the rubble of Westruun. But this

02:38:14.701 --> 02:38:23.764
city appears to have been, some time long ago,
under siege. You see signs of battle, you see

02:38:23.764 --> 02:38:34.490
impact, you see roofs that were burned and now lie as
just black husks. This area has seen warfare long

02:38:34.490 --> 02:38:41.146
ago and the signs of it are old and it looks like
the signs of life that exist in this space, the

02:38:41.146 --> 02:38:44.331
movement you see of figures in the distance
wandering through the streets, there's no

02:38:44.331 --> 02:38:51.322
immediate threat to this city, but you get the
sense just looking out that something big happened

02:38:51.322 --> 02:38:52.949
here a long time ago.

02:38:52.949 --> 02:38:56.042
TRAVIS: Any of you with the eyes, can you see what
that is up in the air?

02:38:56.042 --> 02:39:00.589
LAURA: Yeah, I also want to look and see what the
fuck kind of creatures it is that are moving

02:39:00.589 --> 02:39:04.591
around in the city. But I want to see what kind of
creatures are flying around as well.

02:39:04.591 --> 02:39:07.156
MATT: Okay, so you guys have moved down from the
platform, and you cast Pass Without a Trace, so

02:39:07.156 --> 02:39:15.864
I'd like everyone to make a stealth check, please.
Adding plus ten to your roll.

02:39:15.864 --> 02:39:16.949
SAM: 26.

02:39:16.949 --> 02:39:18.109
TALIESIN: 22.

02:39:18.109 --> 02:39:20.200
MARISHA: 27.

02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:22.268
LIAM: 40.

02:39:22.268 --> 02:39:26.699
LAURA: 23.

02:39:26.699 --> 02:39:28.888
ASHLEY: 21.

02:39:28.888 --> 02:39:30.188
TRAVIS: 18.

02:39:30.188 --> 02:39:32.171
LAURA: Ooh shit, you rolled bad, yo!

02:39:32.171 --> 02:39:40.246
MATT: Okay! So, to stay stealthed, you have to
find some place to be stealthy. You're not

02:39:40.246 --> 02:39:44.084
stealthing out in the middle of nowhere. Where are
you going to find--

02:39:44.084 --> 02:39:45.488
TALIESIN: Towards the city.

02:39:45.488 --> 02:39:46.856
LAURA: Those buildings.

02:39:46.856 --> 02:39:50.608
LIAM: Are we temporarily staying put and talking
shit out or are we going?

02:39:50.608 --> 02:39:52.378
TALIESIN: The building on the left, I'd say.

02:39:52.378 --> 02:39:54.097
LAURA: Yeah, like hide behind something.

02:39:54.097 --> 02:39:59.738
MATT: Okay, you guys dart off to the left. It
appears to have once been a two-story structure,

02:39:59.738 --> 02:40:08.124
but the upper level has since collapsed and part
of it is falling into the bottom floor. As you

02:40:08.124 --> 02:40:14.973
begin to approach the doorway on the inside,
Vex'ahlia, you hear what sounds like a faint

02:40:14.973 --> 02:40:17.115
crunching sound on the inside.

02:40:17.115 --> 02:40:22.834
TRAVIS: (nervous laughter) What the fuck? Oh my
god.

02:40:22.834 --> 02:40:24.788
LIAM: (whispering) What's the matter?

02:40:24.788 --> 02:40:30.860
LAURA: (whispering) There's something in this
building. (louder) Are there windows on the

02:40:30.860 --> 02:40:32.272
building, at all?

02:40:32.272 --> 02:40:36.231
MATT: There are. There is one window on your side,
and the doorway around the corner.

02:40:36.231 --> 02:40:38.149
LAURA: Peek in.

02:40:38.149 --> 02:40:42.503
LIAM: I'll look in the window with my 40 stealth.

02:40:42.503 --> 02:40:49.510
MATT: You glance inside, and as you peek over the
top, in the brief bits of light coming through the

02:40:49.510 --> 02:40:56.448
shadow in here, you can see the collapsed piles of
broken stone and wood planks that used to hold the

02:40:56.448 --> 02:41:01.965
structure of the upper level together. You can see
what looks like furniture that's been destroyed.

02:41:01.965 --> 02:41:07.187
Simple, basic. This is not an
extravagantly decorated space. Built for function,

02:41:07.187 --> 02:41:12.323
more than anything. But moving amidst the shadow,
you see what appears to be a humanoid creature of

02:41:12.323 --> 02:41:21.484
pale gray skin, elongated limbs, long, clawed
fingers. Bald head, pointed, hooked ears, and what

02:41:21.484 --> 02:41:26.708
looks to be slightly broken, jagged, yellow,
elongated teeth in this jaw, as it's currently

02:41:26.708 --> 02:41:31.844
munching on what looks to be a small furred rodent
of some kind. (crunching)

02:41:31.844 --> 02:41:35.898
LIAM: This is probably redundant, but I will
Divine Sense undead.

02:41:35.898 --> 02:41:38.951
MATT: It is very undead.

02:41:38.951 --> 02:41:44.522
LIAM: Do I sense, see, hear anything besides this
one?

02:41:44.522 --> 02:41:46.023
MATT: What's the radius?

02:41:46.023 --> 02:41:47.857
LIAM: 60 feet.

02:41:47.857 --> 02:41:58.295
MATT: Nothing else catches your attention, no. You
watch as it finishes and walks toward the doorway.

02:41:58.295 --> 02:42:06.184
Vex'ahlia, as you're off to the side, you watch as
this creature leans forward and goes into a

02:42:06.184 --> 02:42:13.996
sprint, and then leaps up onto a distant rooftop.
(leaping noises) Just leaping from rooftop to

02:42:13.996 --> 02:42:19.866
rooftop. As you're watching that leap, another
movement catches your eye, and you see another one

02:42:19.866 --> 02:42:30.038
about three blocks down. You can see, there are at
least a handful of these creatures stalking

02:42:30.038 --> 02:42:33.731
through the ruins, leaping from building to
building, from floor to floor.

02:42:33.731 --> 02:42:35.483
ASHLEY: What was it eating?

02:42:35.483 --> 02:42:41.093
MATT: A small, furred creature. You didn't get a good
look at it. You got a fair look at it.

02:42:41.125 --> 02:42:45.947
TRAVIS: It was an otter. I love otters.

02:42:45.947 --> 02:42:48.364
MATT: Apparently, so does the creature.

02:42:48.364 --> 02:42:51.218
LAURA: Why would there be otters in the
Shadowfell?

02:42:51.218 --> 02:42:53.627
MATT: There's something you didn't know about
otters, Laura.

02:42:53.627 --> 02:42:56.682
MARISHA: They love holding hands?

02:42:56.682 --> 02:43:07.479
LAURA: Does it look like any of those scary
creatures are around each other, or are they

02:43:07.479 --> 02:43:08.868
avoiding each other?

02:43:08.868 --> 02:43:12.515
MATT: It's hard to tell at this distance. You're
so far out of the city. You've only been able to

02:43:12.515 --> 02:43:16.556
notice a few shapes from this distance. You'd
probably have to get in a little closer and spend

02:43:16.556 --> 02:43:18.972
some time watching their behavior to pick that
up.

02:43:18.972 --> 02:43:30.115
LIAM: I'm going to crouch down by this dead
rodent. Do I sense the Queen, more or less, here?

02:43:30.115 --> 02:43:32.227
MATT: Make a wisdom check.

02:43:32.227 --> 02:43:37.371
LIAM: 18.

02:43:37.371 --> 02:43:44.322
MATT: You close your eyes for a second. No. None.

02:43:44.322 --> 02:43:51.516
TRAVIS: Can I pop my head back out the door, and
looking at the ground, is there any semblance of a

02:43:51.516 --> 02:43:55.236
sewer system or a runoff grate or anything?

02:43:55.236 --> 02:43:58.206
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:43:58.206 --> 02:44:03.643
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus. Yeah, bitch. Seven.

02:44:03.643 --> 02:44:09.811
MATT: No. Not at all.

02:44:09.811 --> 02:44:11.883
LAURA: Grog! Get your head back inside.

02:44:11.883 --> 02:44:13.051
TRAVIS: What?

02:44:13.051 --> 02:44:14.631
LAURA: There's things flying around out there.

02:44:14.631 --> 02:44:16.006
TRAVIS: I'm keeping a lookout.

02:44:16.006 --> 02:44:18.390
TALIESIN: I'm going to crawl up the wall to the
second floor to see what's up there.

02:44:18.390 --> 02:44:27.074
MATT: As you go up the side and step over onto the
rubble, you see a large, broken, what was once the

02:44:27.074 --> 02:44:34.728
floor of the top floor that slid into this giant
decline, this slide of rubble, if you will. At the

02:44:34.728 --> 02:44:44.754
top, you can see what looks to be a broken weapon
rack that is empty. No weapons on it, but you get

02:44:44.754 --> 02:44:49.983
the sense that this small structure was a
perimeter tower outpost.

02:44:49.983 --> 02:44:52.174
TALIESIN: It's been cleaned out.

02:44:52.174 --> 02:44:53.484
MATT: Apparently.

02:44:53.484 --> 02:44:57.357
TALIESIN: There's no sign of anybody who used to
be here? Nothing of value, nothing of interest?

02:44:57.357 --> 02:44:58.958
MATT: Not in the structure, no.

02:44:58.958 --> 02:45:02.082
TALIESIN: I think we're going to have to move
deeper in.

02:45:02.082 --> 02:45:04.161
SAM: Should I make us all ghoulie?

02:45:04.161 --> 02:45:08.407
TRAVIS: Do we notice anything strange about the
little necklaces that we're wearing now that we're

02:45:08.407 --> 02:45:09.861
in this place?

02:45:09.861 --> 02:45:13.085
MATT: Nothing at the moment, no.

02:45:13.085 --> 02:45:16.634
LIAM: Hey, you feeling good about your decision to
come with us?

02:45:16.634 --> 02:45:28.115
SAM: This is terrible. I haven't had this much fun
in a long time. Let's go do it. I'll cast Seeming

02:45:28.115 --> 02:45:39.191
on us and make us all gray, pointy-eared, little
Nosferatu-vampirey things, I suppose. Did I see

02:45:39.191 --> 02:45:41.188
the thing that skittered out?

02:45:41.188 --> 02:45:42.389
MATT: Very briefly.

02:45:42.389 --> 02:45:44.729
SAM: I've seen other undead things.

02:45:44.729 --> 02:45:47.973
MATT: Yeah. You can make something that looks
undead-adjacent.

02:45:47.973 --> 02:45:56.356
SAM: Yeah. My guy will look more like the Meat Man
in undead form, but otherwise, everyone's normal.

02:45:56.356 --> 02:46:04.355
LAURA: I want straggly, but still a braid. Really
nasty, straggly hair.

02:46:04.355 --> 02:46:06.483
SAM: Your ear's half off.

02:46:06.483 --> 02:46:11.484
TRAVIS: I definitely want an eyeball hanging out.

02:46:11.484 --> 02:46:12.481
SAM: Sure.

02:46:12.481 --> 02:46:16.821
TALIESIN: Straight hole right through the head. No
jaw.

02:46:16.821 --> 02:46:18.272
SAM: Okay.

02:46:18.272 --> 02:46:22.744
MATT: All right. What do you guys do?

02:46:22.744 --> 02:46:28.260
LAURA: I think we should probably try to observe
the things that are flying around the tower.

02:46:28.260 --> 02:46:31.348
TALIESIN: Slowly make our way to the town.

02:46:31.348 --> 02:46:37.523
LAURA: Observe. Still try to avoid any of those
scary creatures, but see if they avoid each other

02:46:37.523 --> 02:46:39.291
as we look at them.

02:46:39.291 --> 02:46:41.240
LIAM: Super slow, super careful.

02:46:41.240 --> 02:46:44.045
SAM: Maybe we should stagger.

02:46:44.045 --> 02:46:47.950
LAURA: No, those things were speedy. Be normal.

02:46:47.950 --> 02:46:49.934
SAM: We'll walk like this.

02:46:49.934 --> 02:46:53.349
TALIESIN: Left, right, left, step, step, step.

02:46:53.349 --> 02:46:57.138
(laughter)

02:46:57.138 --> 02:47:06.681
MATT: Make a performance check. No.

02:47:06.681 --> 02:47:13.996
MARISHA: While they were looking at weapons racks
and doing stuff like that--

02:47:13.996 --> 02:47:16.757
TALIESIN: You make it sound so tawdry. Carry on.

02:47:16.757 --> 02:47:27.231
MARISHA: While they were doing that, I pull Vax
aside. I grab him--

02:47:27.231 --> 02:47:29.378
SAM: Let's get married.

02:47:29.378 --> 02:47:32.935
LAURA: Let's just do it.

02:47:32.935 --> 02:47:43.526
MARISHA: Goddamn it. Scanlan's back. Listen, you
can't die, and I don't know what's going on in

02:47:43.526 --> 02:47:47.182
your head, or what you're thinking, but I feel
like it's not good.

02:47:47.182 --> 02:47:53.800
LIAM: I'm the best I've ever been. Don't worry
about me. Worry about us.

02:47:53.800 --> 02:47:56.205
MARISHA: Has the Raven Queen spoken to you at
all?

02:47:56.205 --> 02:47:58.422
LIAM: Yes.

02:47:58.422 --> 02:48:01.690
MARISHA: Recently? Down here?

02:48:01.690 --> 02:48:04.941
LIAM: Not since we got here, no, but recently.

02:48:04.941 --> 02:48:19.754
MARISHA: I need you with us. Not with her. I need
you with us, and with me. So let me do this. And

02:48:19.754 --> 02:48:27.638
I'm going to burn my 9th-level spell and cast
Foresight on Vax.

02:48:27.638 --> 02:48:29.418
SAM: Ooh, Foresight!

02:48:29.418 --> 02:48:30.887
LAURA: What is that?

02:48:30.887 --> 02:48:34.152
SAM: Shit. It's real good.

02:48:34.152 --> 02:48:36.694
(laughter)

02:48:36.694 --> 02:48:38.934
LIAM: This one goes to nine.

02:48:38.934 --> 02:48:40.245
LAURA: What is Foresight?

02:48:40.245 --> 02:48:44.982
MARISHA: Don't fuck it up, man. It's my 9th-level
spell.

02:48:44.982 --> 02:48:51.365
MATT: For the next eight hours, not concentration,
you can't be surprised. You have advantage on all

02:48:51.365 --> 02:48:55.557
attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws,
and other creatures have disadvantage on attack

02:48:55.557 --> 02:48:56.743
rolls against you.

02:48:56.743 --> 02:48:58.072
LAURA: Holy shit.

02:48:58.072 --> 02:49:04.248
SAM: You can see just in the future. Three
seconds.

02:49:04.248 --> 02:49:06.000
LAURA: That's amazing!

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:09.251
LIAM: You guys, let's go shopping!

02:49:09.251 --> 02:49:12.482
(laughter)

02:49:12.482 --> 02:49:15.687
TRAVIS: I raise my blood axe...

02:49:15.687 --> 02:49:20.246
MATT: All right.

02:49:20.246 --> 02:49:25.364
SAM: Am I going to die in three seconds?
Am I going to die in three seconds?

02:49:25.364 --> 02:49:30.821
(laughter)

02:49:30.821 --> 02:49:34.238
TALIESIN: Let's make our way into town. Quietly.

02:49:34.238 --> 02:49:36.055
LIAM: Within the next eight hours.

02:49:36.055 --> 02:49:38.541
SAM: I feel like Vax should lead the party.

02:49:38.541 --> 02:49:43.196
MATT: All right, so are you stealthing through?

02:49:43.196 --> 02:49:44.448
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:49:44.448 --> 02:49:46.493
LAURA: Still being stealthy, but yeah.

02:49:46.493 --> 02:49:48.816
LIAM: Looking cool, but stealthing.

02:49:48.816 --> 02:49:50.821
MARISHA: We look so cool.

02:49:50.821 --> 02:49:52.720
TALIESIN: We're not doing--

02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:55.054
LAURA: Matt's like, I will kill you all.

02:49:55.054 --> 02:50:02.561
MATT: You guys scatter just enough to dart between
alleys and find shaded bits and leap from base of

02:50:02.603 --> 02:50:13.551
building to alley, keeping a cohesive unit as best
you can. The first thing you notice, the further

02:50:13.551 --> 02:50:21.887
in you get, even within just the first couple of
blocks of the city, you see broken swords, you see

02:50:21.887 --> 02:50:33.986
pieces of armor, and you see figures walking
through the street ahead of you. You see hundreds

02:50:33.986 --> 02:50:49.477
of scattered skeletons, decomposing bodies
shambling through, but they all walk in patterns.

02:50:49.477 --> 02:50:58.541
They're not scattered, mindless. There is some
will or direction to their movements. You see them

02:50:58.541 --> 02:51:06.995
wearing ornate armor with designs and symbols on
them that look old and tarnished and scratched.

02:51:06.995 --> 02:51:12.352
LIAM: Are they moving like troops or is each
individual following its own...?

02:51:12.352 --> 02:51:17.740
MATT: Some are moving as troops, and occasionally
you see an individual wander off, but they're just

02:51:17.740 --> 02:51:28.914
sort of walking around and scanning. I'm going to
have Scanlan, you roll a history check, and Pike,

02:51:28.914 --> 02:51:30.583
roll a religion check.

02:51:30.583 --> 02:51:45.913
SAM: 17. Oh! You know what, seems important, I
will inspire myself. Can I do that? I haven't done

02:51:45.913 --> 02:51:47.416
this in so long.

02:51:47.416 --> 02:51:50.077
MATT: Yeah, add a d12 to it.

02:51:50.077 --> 02:51:52.470
SAM: 18.

02:51:52.470 --> 02:51:56.188
MATT: Got to get the dust off, man.

02:51:56.188 --> 02:51:58.056
ASHLEY: 23.

02:51:58.056 --> 02:52:11.099
MATT: Okay. You, looking over there, a lot of the
armor that these skeletons are wearing, it doesn't

02:52:11.099 --> 02:52:26.013
fit with the Shadowfell. The silvers, the golds,
the tattered blue cloaks, there's something regal

02:52:26.013 --> 02:52:32.320
about some of these armor sets, as old and ancient
as they may be. It doesn't seem to match the sense

02:52:32.320 --> 02:52:37.069
and feel of the Shadowfell. While you're having
this thought, Pike, you glance over and look at

02:52:37.069 --> 02:52:43.736
one of these pieces of armor and you recognize the
symbol, it's like a stained-glass circle with a

02:52:43.736 --> 02:52:56.605
gold star in the center. It's the symbol of Pelor.
Many of these bodies, these undead wandering the

02:52:56.605 --> 02:53:04.555
city, seem to have been soldiers that fell in
whatever battle that once besieged this city, and

02:53:04.555 --> 02:53:06.681
many bear the mark of Pelor.

02:53:06.681 --> 02:53:09.858
TALIESIN: I mean, the Chained--

02:53:09.858 --> 02:53:12.764
LAURA: The Chained Oblivion.

02:53:12.764 --> 02:53:16.046
TALIESIN: The Chained Oblivion, there was a fight
between.

02:53:16.046 --> 02:53:22.516
MATT: That was, but that was on the Prime
Material, and that was in the vicinity of the

02:53:22.516 --> 02:53:24.140
Alabaster Sierras.

02:53:24.140 --> 02:53:28.274
TALIESIN: That mark couldn't have ended up--

02:53:28.274 --> 02:53:30.605
LAURA: Was the Shadowfell always the Shadowfell?

02:53:30.605 --> 02:53:32.169
TALIESIN: I don't know.

02:53:32.169 --> 02:53:37.599
SAM: Maybe this city was taken somewhere else or
something. Transported here.

02:53:37.599 --> 02:53:40.597
MARISHA: Does this city look like Whitestone?

02:53:40.597 --> 02:53:46.469
MATT: No. None of the buildings, the structures,
resemble Whitestone.

02:53:46.469 --> 02:53:53.282
SAM: Is there any architecture that I, or anyone,
notices, like from a region of where we've been?

02:53:53.282 --> 02:54:02.367
MATT: No. Not really.

02:54:02.367 --> 02:54:04.349
SAM: Mid-century modern, mostly?

02:54:04.349 --> 02:54:16.954
MATT: Yeah, yeah, lot of Ikea. No, but you do get
the sense-- some of the architecture here does

02:54:16.954 --> 02:54:26.272
resemble elements of some architecture designs
that remind you of Wildemount.

02:54:26.272 --> 02:54:28.864
SAM: Man, we should have brought Tary.

02:54:28.864 --> 02:54:46.382
MATT: But, like, old Wildemount. Like, no modern
structures, definitely from centuries back. As you

02:54:46.382 --> 02:54:50.280
continue to wander and keep your eyes out, you
occasionally hear the distant (creature

02:54:50.280 --> 02:55:00.561
shrieking). You watch as the (wings flapping)
winged, dark beasts are circling overhead.

02:55:00.561 --> 02:55:01.999
SAM: Do we recognize them?

02:55:01.999 --> 02:55:03.390
MATT: No, not yet.

02:55:03.390 --> 02:55:04.825
LAURA: Never seen anything like it?

02:55:04.825 --> 02:55:10.163
MATT: You have not seen anything like these
before. Black as night against the gray sky. From

02:55:10.163 --> 02:55:16.200
this distance, you make out no details in their
bodies. It's almost like a moving shadow above

02:55:16.200 --> 02:55:25.685
you. Wherever light would hit to give you some
sense of structure, it's just absence, void. It's

02:55:25.685 --> 02:55:27.741
just a flying shadow.

02:55:27.741 --> 02:55:33.115
TALIESIN: Are there any buildings that have enough
structure to them where it feels like there might

02:55:33.115 --> 02:55:36.701
be things inside that have been relatively
unmolested at this point?

02:55:36.701 --> 02:55:40.708
MATT: Possibly. Make a perception check.

02:55:40.708 --> 02:55:48.427
TALIESIN: 12.

02:55:48.427 --> 02:55:53.109
MATT: 12. I mean, there are some buildings that
look like they have some structure, and the

02:55:53.109 --> 02:55:58.482
further into the city you get, the more you see
that this becomes a little less destroyed. But you

02:55:58.482 --> 02:56:03.318
begin to see some figures moving that are not
armored undead, not zombies, and not any of these

02:56:03.318 --> 02:56:09.710
quick-moving creatures. You see three figures
walking back towards the orb where you guys came

02:56:09.710 --> 02:56:18.317
from in the same black cult robes, hoods off. They
would appear to be human.

02:56:18.317 --> 02:56:19.999
TALIESIN: But they're cultists.

02:56:19.999 --> 02:56:21.556
MATT: But they're cultists.

02:56:21.556 --> 02:56:24.337
LAURA: They don't look like they're afraid of
walking around?

02:56:24.337 --> 02:56:25.777
LIAM: Yeah, what's their demeanor?

02:56:25.777 --> 02:56:27.746
MATT: They're just walking through.

02:56:27.746 --> 02:56:29.291
LIAM: How far are they from us?

02:56:29.291 --> 02:56:33.925
MATT: They're about 100 feet up. A little further
than that.

02:56:33.925 --> 02:56:35.317
LIAM: Coming our way?

02:56:35.317 --> 02:56:38.603
MATT: Coming your way towards the sphere where you
guys were.

02:56:38.603 --> 02:56:40.455
ASHLEY: Maybe that's what we need to look like.

02:56:40.455 --> 02:56:41.766
TRAVIS: Cover and ambush?

02:56:41.766 --> 02:56:44.726
LIAM: Or watch, see what they're doing.

02:56:44.726 --> 02:56:46.761
TALIESIN: Kill two, keep one to question?

02:56:46.761 --> 02:56:48.865
MARISHA: How many are there, three?

02:56:48.865 --> 02:56:49.909
MATT: Three of them.

02:56:49.909 --> 02:56:51.985
TALIESIN: God, can we even kill people here? Will
they die?

02:56:51.985 --> 02:56:56.801
LIAM: Yes. But do we watch, see what they do with
the sphere first?

02:56:56.801 --> 02:56:58.484
TALIESIN: Let's cut them off.

02:56:58.484 --> 02:57:05.092
SAM: I could be bait. Then you could come ambush
them.

02:57:05.092 --> 02:57:08.311
LIAM: Let's watch for a moment longer.

02:57:08.311 --> 02:57:10.080
TRAVIS: Find cover.

02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:14.250
MATT: Okay. So what do you guys do?

02:57:14.250 --> 02:57:15.762
TRAVIS: I'm going into the building.

02:57:15.762 --> 02:57:18.559
LAURA: I'm following them, just subtly.

02:57:18.559 --> 02:57:20.290
MARISHA: Yeah, let the twins go ahead first.

02:57:20.290 --> 02:57:22.966
MATT: Okay, so the two twins follow and the rest
of you duck into a building off to the side? Okay.

02:57:22.966 --> 02:57:26.747
You guys, I need you both individually to roll
stealth as you tail behind them.

02:57:26.747 --> 02:57:35.413
LAURA: And we still have Pass Without a Trace on.
34.

02:57:35.413 --> 02:57:37.643
LIAM: 45.

02:57:37.643 --> 02:57:41.992
SAM: Wait, we're staying put and they're walking
off somewhere else? How are we going to see what's

02:57:41.992 --> 02:57:42.991
going to happen?

02:57:42.991 --> 02:57:44.356
TRAVIS: They were walking towards us.

02:57:44.356 --> 02:57:48.635
MATT: The cultists are basically walking past you
guys, going the opposite direction of where you

02:57:48.635 --> 02:57:56.701
were traveling, and both the twins just vanish
from sight. You're like, "Well what if-- Gone

02:57:56.701 --> 02:58:03.757
again." You guys pace behind them, jumping from
alley to alley. Occasionally they'll stop and do a

02:58:03.757 --> 02:58:10.449
walk over. There's not a sense of paranoia, but
they're very watchful. Their attire, while still

02:58:10.449 --> 02:58:15.380
cult robes, is a little more intricately adorned,
and you see the one in the front is carrying a

02:58:15.380 --> 02:58:19.303
hanging lantern that gives off this weird smoke
behind it, like a censer.

02:58:19.303 --> 02:58:21.777
TRAVIS: A censer?

02:58:21.777 --> 02:58:24.394
LIAM: Yeah, like a Catholic.

02:58:24.394 --> 02:58:33.219
MATT: Yeah. But it gives off this faint glow, and
they walk and make their way slowly outside of the

02:58:33.219 --> 02:58:42.689
city towards the pillar where the orb is. And they
just look around it, walk over to the few

02:58:42.689 --> 02:58:48.443
buildings to the side, divide a little bit to a
perimeter, reconvene at the base of the orb, and

02:58:48.443 --> 02:58:51.051
begin making their way back to the center of the
city.

02:58:51.051 --> 02:58:53.803
LAURA: Is there anything else around? Should we
kill them?

02:58:53.803 --> 02:58:59.841
LIAM: All three? Take one? Kill two, leave one?

02:58:59.841 --> 02:59:02.189
SAM: We can ambush them.

02:59:02.189 --> 02:59:04.333
LAURA: Get ready for an ambush.

02:59:04.333 --> 02:59:06.413
TALIESIN: When they walk by the house, push them.

02:59:06.413 --> 02:59:09.065
LAURA: When they walk past you guys, we'll
attack.

02:59:09.065 --> 02:59:14.516
SAM: Should I put someone out there to confuse
them?

02:59:14.516 --> 02:59:16.716
LIAM: No. When we go, follow suit.

02:59:16.716 --> 02:59:19.727
MARISHA: I can Grasping Vine one into the
building, right into Grog's hands.

02:59:19.727 --> 02:59:23.924
LAURA: Wait until we attack them first.

02:59:23.924 --> 02:59:31.769
MATT: All right. The three of them walk back,
leaving a small censer trail behind. The smoke,

02:59:31.769 --> 02:59:39.568
the almost incense-like smoke, burns off within a
few feet after. They eventually cross right next

02:59:39.568 --> 02:59:45.130
to the doorway and window to where the rest of you
are waiting. Both of you guys roll for an attack.

02:59:45.130 --> 02:59:47.378
Are you aiming at two different ones? Same one?

02:59:47.378 --> 02:59:52.121
LAURA: Two different ones. And it's an
automatic...

02:59:52.121 --> 02:59:56.236
MATT: It's an automatic crit if you hit, and you
have advantage on the hit

02:59:56.236 --> 02:59:57.891
because they don't see you.

02:59:57.891 --> 03:00:04.912
LAURA: Natural 20. Not that it matters, because I
already got a crit.

03:00:04.912 --> 03:00:06.480
MATT: But still, it's nice.

03:00:06.480 --> 03:00:11.055
LIAM: 26.

03:00:11.055 --> 03:00:17.536
MATT: 26. Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage, both
of you, doubling your weapon die damage and your

03:00:17.536 --> 03:00:18.639
sneak attack.

03:00:18.639 --> 03:00:20.212
LAURA: Bramble shot.

03:00:20.212 --> 03:00:21.812
SAM: There's three of them, right?

03:00:21.812 --> 03:00:38.038
MATT: Three of them, yes... You also double the
bramble shot damage because it's a crit.

03:00:38.038 --> 03:00:44.645
SAM: Hey, look, we're killing things! Well,
maybe.

03:00:44.645 --> 03:00:47.527
TALIESIN: Incapacitating, at the very least.

03:00:47.527 --> 03:00:48.549
LIAM: 85.

03:00:48.549 --> 03:00:49.951
LAURA: Oh, shit, dude.

03:00:49.951 --> 03:00:51.444
SAM: 85?

03:00:51.444 --> 03:00:55.472
MATT: 85 damage. Rogues, man. It's what they do.

03:00:55.472 --> 03:00:58.287
TALIESIN: The head is cleaved from the body.

03:00:58.287 --> 03:01:00.760
LAURA: 56 for me.

03:01:00.760 --> 03:01:05.778
SAM: It was Kima and Allura on a mission. They're
dead.

03:01:05.778 --> 03:01:12.283
MATT: As the three of them walk, the two on the
outside both, at the same time, (impacts),

03:01:12.283 --> 03:01:19.670
crumple. No noise, just fall to their knees, face
down on the ground, unmoving. The one in the

03:01:19.670 --> 03:01:24.361
center that's holding the censer turns and looks
back and sees--

03:01:24.361 --> 03:01:28.849
MARISHA: And I go (whoosh) and Grasping Vine him,
and throw him right into Grog's hands.

03:01:28.893 --> 03:01:30.132
LAURA: Don't kill him!

03:01:30.132 --> 03:01:35.018
TRAVIS: And if he's successfully thrown, I just
cover his mouth and

03:01:35.018 --> 03:01:37.018
grab the back of his head and squeeze.

03:01:37.018 --> 03:01:38.808
SAM: Which mouth?

03:01:38.808 --> 03:01:42.161
TRAVIS: Ew, God.

03:01:42.161 --> 03:01:44.258
MATT: That is a 16.

03:01:44.258 --> 03:01:45.312
MARISHA: Fail.

03:01:45.312 --> 03:01:50.818
MATT: Fail. That's right, because 21. So as soon
as he turns around, out of one of the cracks in

03:01:50.818 --> 03:01:55.673
the stonework nearby, you can see some dry,
grass-like gray brush. There is what appears to be

03:01:55.673 --> 03:02:04.154
some faint hints of local plant life, but it all
looks like gray, dry grass. Or, you know after a

03:02:04.154 --> 03:02:10.551
morning freeze, when you see elements of a field
that have that weird, textured, almost water plant

03:02:10.551 --> 03:02:16.924
look to it? It's clusters of that, but curled. And
one of those whips out with this one, long,

03:02:16.924 --> 03:02:22.880
grayish, almost fleshy-looking vine that wraps
around it and yanks it inside the house. (grunt)

03:02:22.880 --> 03:02:25.845
Gets yanked in. Grog, you catch him.

03:02:25.886 --> 03:02:27.255
TRAVIS: Cover his mouth.

03:02:27.255 --> 03:02:28.840
LIAM: Like clockwork.

03:02:28.840 --> 03:02:33.962
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check, Grog.

03:02:33.962 --> 03:02:38.497
TRAVIS: Oh, that's a million. 26.

03:02:38.497 --> 03:02:46.204
MATT: He struggles against your grasp, and it's
nothing. It's like holding a baby in your arms.

03:02:46.204 --> 03:02:50.088
TRAVIS: Percy, will you give him a reminder not to
move?

03:02:50.088 --> 03:02:57.400
TALIESIN: Oh, yes, this will be fun. I take out a
small, three-inch steel ball. I look him right in

03:02:57.400 --> 03:03:06.813
the eye, and go, Manners. And I toss the steel
ball at our friend. The iron bands.

03:03:06.813 --> 03:03:09.912
MATT: Okay. What does he have to save on that?

03:03:09.912 --> 03:03:13.436
TALIESIN: I actually make a ranged attack roll.

03:03:13.436 --> 03:03:18.881
MATT: Okay, make a ranged attack roll. d20 plus
your dexterity. You have advantage because he's

03:03:18.881 --> 03:03:20.153
currently restrained by Grog.

03:03:20.153 --> 03:03:26.944
TALIESIN: Makes me feel better. Thank God. That's
still fine. 23.

03:03:26.944 --> 03:03:31.695
MATT: Okay, so as you chuck it the three feet, it
impacts, and you watch as the orb swells and

03:03:31.695 --> 03:03:38.419
expands, and all of these chain-like plates of
dark, reddish iron metal wrap around him,

03:03:38.419 --> 03:03:42.302
constraining his hands, his legs, and locking him
into place around his jaw

03:03:42.302 --> 03:03:43.798
and his head and his mouth.

03:03:43.798 --> 03:03:47.243
TALIESIN: Excellent.

03:03:47.243 --> 03:03:48.529
LAURA: Can he still talk?

03:03:48.529 --> 03:03:50.417
TRAVIS: Yeah, when I take my hand off his mouth.

03:03:50.417 --> 03:03:54.303
TALIESIN: This thing will allow him to talk. I
believe this thing has a...

03:03:54.303 --> 03:03:57.469
MATT: It has a little slit that you can remove to
the side.

03:03:57.469 --> 03:03:59.667
LIAM: It's got a gimp hole?

03:03:59.667 --> 03:04:07.110
MATT: All good magical items do, Liam. That's what
you call an artifact.

03:04:07.110 --> 03:04:12.127
TALIESIN: I give him a second to sit and I wait
until we're all inside.

03:04:12.127 --> 03:04:14.708
MATT: Okay. You guys both attacked.

03:04:14.708 --> 03:04:16.403
LAURA: Pull the bodies inside.

03:04:16.403 --> 03:04:20.462
MATT: First make a stealth check, because you both
exposed yourselves with the attack, and there are

03:04:20.462 --> 03:04:22.097
creatures overhead shrieking.

03:04:22.097 --> 03:04:26.347
TALIESIN: With advantage. He has advantage.

03:04:26.347 --> 03:04:28.688
LIAM: Plus Pass Without Trace.

03:04:28.688 --> 03:04:29.890
LAURA: 35.

03:04:29.890 --> 03:04:32.294
LIAM: 37, that's kind of low for me.

03:04:32.294 --> 03:04:38.833
MATT: Okay. You watch as one swoops nearby, and
you hear the (shrieking), and you guys dart by.

03:04:38.833 --> 03:04:44.105
Doesn't seem to take notice. You drop back into
the building, and there you see your quarry now

03:04:44.105 --> 03:04:47.590
bolted to himself through a series of dark iron
metal plates.

03:04:47.590 --> 03:04:50.470
TRAVIS: Our quarry, does he have two eyes?

03:04:50.470 --> 03:04:59.146
MATT: He does not have both eyes. Left eye is
missing. You see him now. This is a man in his

03:04:59.146 --> 03:05:05.957
mid-40s, salt and pepper hair, seems to be an
unkempt beard around his chin. Hair is maybe about

03:05:05.957 --> 03:05:14.586
ear-length, a little tattered now since he's been
roughed up and manhandled a bit. His skin's a bit

03:05:14.586 --> 03:05:20.879
yellowed, a little jaundiced. You get the sense
he's probably been living here for quite some

03:05:20.879 --> 03:05:24.605
time, and he doesn't look healthy.

03:05:24.605 --> 03:05:29.050
LAURA: I grab the thing that was making the smoke
and bring it.

03:05:29.087 --> 03:05:42.122
MATT: The smell is awful. It's hard to
differentiate from the general smell of decay and

03:05:42.122 --> 03:05:49.219
dust that this entire realm seems to be suffused
with, but the smoke that billows off of this is

03:05:49.219 --> 03:05:58.087
like fresh putrescence, mixed with a very, very
strong charcoal.

03:05:58.087 --> 03:06:01.235
TALIESIN: This may be how they move freely.

03:06:01.235 --> 03:06:05.292
LAURA: That's what I'm thinking. We hide the
bodies. We'll bring the bodies inside, too, so

03:06:05.292 --> 03:06:07.046
that nobody sees them.

03:06:07.046 --> 03:06:08.848
LIAM: Press him.

03:06:08.848 --> 03:06:23.046
TALIESIN: I'm going to let you speak, and we're
going to have a conversation. Given where you are,

03:06:23.046 --> 03:06:30.571
the circumstances that we find you in, I'm going
to let you know that there is a curse upon my

03:06:30.571 --> 03:06:40.242
weapon, and the souls that are killed with this
weapon are claimed by a demon named Orthax. Now, I

03:06:40.242 --> 03:06:45.442
haven't experimented as to what happens when
somebody's soul is claimed by more than one

03:06:45.442 --> 03:06:52.938
creature, but I'm excited to find out. So wouldn't
it be interesting if everything you've been

03:06:52.938 --> 03:07:02.528
promised here is suddenly null and void? So, yes,
we may threaten your life, but I want you to know

03:07:02.528 --> 03:07:11.378
that what's really at stake here is just precisely
what's left of your soul, so answer with caution.

03:07:11.378 --> 03:07:13.871
And I unlock.

03:07:13.871 --> 03:07:16.228
MATT: Roll an intimidation check.

03:07:16.228 --> 03:07:22.777
TRAVIS: That was nasty, it was real good.

03:07:22.777 --> 03:07:35.971
TALIESIN: Fucking dice. No love on that one.
Terrible. Eight.

03:07:35.971 --> 03:07:47.473
MATT: You unlock, and he just goes (laughs) "I
don't have to tell you anything."

03:07:47.473 --> 03:07:57.308
LIAM: I punch him in the temple.

03:07:57.308 --> 03:08:05.720
MATT: "This pain is meager. I've felt far worse.
I've given myself far worse.

03:08:05.720 --> 03:08:08.569
"Pry and poke all you want."

03:08:08.569 --> 03:08:10.290
LIAM: I punch him in the mouth.

03:08:10.290 --> 03:08:15.547
TALIESIN: This sort of thing isn't going to get us
anywhere. Pike.

03:08:15.547 --> 03:08:17.873
Think you can give him back his eye?

03:08:17.873 --> 03:08:22.462
LAURA: Oh, that's a good idea.

03:08:22.462 --> 03:08:26.253
SAM: You're going to use a carrot?

03:08:26.253 --> 03:08:29.128
LIAM: No, that's the stick.

03:08:29.128 --> 03:08:31.155
MARISHA: Do you have Regenerate with you?

03:08:31.155 --> 03:08:32.931
ASHLEY: I do.

03:08:32.931 --> 03:08:35.216
LAURA: Separate him from his god.

03:08:35.216 --> 03:08:37.721
ASHLEY: I put my hand over his eye.

03:08:37.721 --> 03:08:39.925
MATT: He doesn't flinch.

03:08:39.925 --> 03:08:44.250
LAURA: Do it.

03:08:44.250 --> 03:08:47.962
ASHLEY: Are you ready to have your eye back?

03:08:47.962 --> 03:08:50.538
MATT: "I'll just pluck it right back out."

03:08:50.538 --> 03:08:56.650
ASHLEY: Well, you can't. Because you're just going
to stay in these binds forever.

03:08:56.650 --> 03:08:59.693
LIAM: Or Grog will pull your arms off.

03:08:59.693 --> 03:09:01.571
MATT: "Do your worst."

03:09:01.571 --> 03:09:03.490
LAURA: No, he's not scared of pain.

03:09:03.490 --> 03:09:12.662
TRAVIS: Just ask him some questions before the fun
begins. Let's see what he answers with.

03:09:12.662 --> 03:09:15.821
LAURA: Do you know Delilah Briarwood?

03:09:15.821 --> 03:09:29.834
MATT: "Maybe. The fact that you're already here
means that you have no way out, so I fear not.

03:09:29.834 --> 03:09:38.365
"Even if I perish, I die with the comfort of
knowing that you'll perish soon after. That is the

03:09:38.365 --> 03:09:41.438
"comfort in the Whispered One."

03:09:41.438 --> 03:09:43.010
LAURA: Vecna.

03:09:43.010 --> 03:09:50.357
MATT: "So you knowingly came here. You are both
foolish and simple."

03:09:50.357 --> 03:09:52.183
TRAVIS: No, that's just me.

03:09:52.183 --> 03:10:00.600
MATT: "So you said you have questions."

03:10:00.600 --> 03:10:04.981
TRAVIS: What's flying around in the sky?

03:10:04.981 --> 03:10:09.165
MATT: "The sentinels."

03:10:09.165 --> 03:10:11.177
TRAVIS: Sentinels.

03:10:11.177 --> 03:10:21.083
MATT: "That is what they are for us, but they are
known more formally as Gloom Stalkers."

03:10:21.083 --> 03:10:28.662
TRAVIS: Gloom Stalkers. That is a great name.

03:10:28.662 --> 03:10:32.280
MATT: "They are hungry. Ever hungry."

03:10:32.280 --> 03:10:37.025
TRAVIS: They also look fearsome. Do people cower
before them in their presence?

03:10:37.025 --> 03:10:38.443
MATT: "You will."

03:10:38.443 --> 03:10:41.672
TRAVIS: I'll bet. I am easily startled.

03:10:41.672 --> 03:10:45.574
TALIESIN: Where are you from?

03:10:45.574 --> 03:10:49.534
MATT: "It does not matter. The past means nothing
when you give up your secrets."

03:10:49.534 --> 03:11:01.380
TALIESIN: The ziggurats, there's three of them.
You've come through the Wildemount one?

03:11:01.380 --> 03:11:08.044
MATT: He shakes his head. "You will get no
information from me."

03:11:08.044 --> 03:11:16.274
SAM: All right. Can I have a try? You've got one
eye, right? Ugh.

03:11:16.274 --> 03:11:23.960
MATT: You see the gaping socket, and as he goes to
blink one eye, you can see the marking on the

03:11:23.960 --> 03:11:29.066
inside, it looks like it was burned out, so you
watch the outer edge of the flesh and muscle

03:11:29.066 --> 03:11:30.630
twitch whenever he blinks.

03:11:30.630 --> 03:11:39.147
SAM: Gross ocular muscles. I just want to make you
feel good, man, so I'll just sing to you. I'll

03:11:39.147 --> 03:11:47.548
hold up my cone, and I'll sing, (singing) Just the
two of us. You can't quit me if you tried. Just

03:11:47.548 --> 03:11:54.102
the two of us. Me and your eye. So I'll Dominate
Person.

03:11:54.102 --> 03:11:57.462
TRAVIS: He's back.

03:11:57.462 --> 03:12:08.316
MATT: That is... That's an 11. All right. His grin
glazes over and he goes...

03:12:08.316 --> 03:12:16.871
SAM: Will you please tell us everything you know
when we ask you?

03:12:16.871 --> 03:12:18.308
MATT: "But of course."

03:12:18.308 --> 03:12:23.658
SAM: Where are you from?

03:12:23.658 --> 03:12:34.993
MATT: "I am from the outskirts of a far eastern
Wildemount village named Zuvan. It was built on the

03:12:34.993 --> 03:12:41.364
"ruins of Orthanus. I was a poor man, but I found
purpose."

03:12:41.364 --> 03:12:49.852
SAM: Did you come through a ziggurat in Wildemount?
And if so, where?

03:12:49.852 --> 03:12:55.892
MATT: "I don't know. I was taken with many others
who had given themselves to the secrets of the

03:12:55.892 --> 03:13:04.199
"Undying King. I awoke here, mauled but living, and
was inducted, and that was when he took my eye."

03:13:04.199 --> 03:13:05.654
SAM: He?

03:13:05.654 --> 03:13:07.537
MATT: "He. One of the acolytes."

03:13:07.537 --> 03:13:13.857
SAM: The flying things. Well, we know what they
are now.

03:13:13.857 --> 03:13:15.970
TRAVIS: What do they do?

03:13:15.970 --> 03:13:17.850
SAM: Do the flying things have magical powers?

03:13:17.850 --> 03:13:25.354
MATT: "I do not know. They shriek, they eat, they
watch. I do not mess with such terrible and

03:13:25.354 --> 03:13:26.967
"wonderful instruments."

03:13:26.967 --> 03:13:29.096
ASHLEY: How does he get through all the dead?

03:13:29.096 --> 03:13:34.335
SAM: The smoke-making thing that you were
carrying. What is it and how does it work?

03:13:34.335 --> 03:13:41.497
MATT: "It protects those of us who are not as
esteemed in the arts of necromancy to not be

03:13:41.497 --> 03:13:47.168
"bothered by the roving, long-dead soldiers of the
last war on Thar Amphala."

03:13:47.168 --> 03:13:49.705
SAM: The last war on Thar Amphala! What does that
mean?

03:13:49.705 --> 03:13:50.951
LAURA: I don't know!

03:13:50.951 --> 03:13:52.389
SAM: What does that mean?

03:13:52.389 --> 03:13:54.220
MARISHA: The last war on what?

03:13:54.220 --> 03:14:04.313
MATT: Thar Amphala. Thar Amphala, the city built
for the Whispered One, long ago.

03:14:04.313 --> 03:14:06.168
SAM: Oh, that's where we are.

03:14:06.168 --> 03:14:12.423
LAURA: Who lives in the tower, Vecna? Is that
where he is?

03:14:12.423 --> 03:14:15.460
MATT: He just looks at you strangely.

03:14:15.460 --> 03:14:17.545
LIAM: It's got to come from him.

03:14:17.545 --> 03:14:19.215
LAURA: I'm a really good friend of his.

03:14:19.215 --> 03:14:23.134
SAM: She really is, that's being rude. But who
lives in the tower?

03:14:23.134 --> 03:14:27.255
Is it Vecna or Mistress Delilah?

03:14:27.255 --> 03:14:35.242
MATT: "It's where his essence has slowly reclaimed
the space. He will live soon."

03:14:35.242 --> 03:14:37.195
LAURA: Oh, but he's not back yet!

03:14:37.195 --> 03:14:40.547
SAM: The Mistress Delilah. Where is she right
now?

03:14:40.547 --> 03:14:49.738
MATT: "I have not seen her, but if she is not out,
then perhaps the ritual is soon. She is probably

03:14:49.738 --> 03:14:53.453
"at the top of Entropis."

03:14:53.453 --> 03:14:55.759
SAM: Entropis is the tower?

03:14:55.759 --> 03:14:56.878
MATT: "Yes."

03:14:56.878 --> 03:14:58.058
MARISHA: That tower?

03:14:58.058 --> 03:15:01.761
SAM: The only tower.

03:15:01.761 --> 03:15:07.850
TRAVIS: What other alarms are there in the city
that would detect outsiders?

03:15:07.850 --> 03:15:10.555
SAM: What protections do you have on the tower?

03:15:10.555 --> 03:15:17.495
MATT: "I do not know the specifics. I am but a
watcher on the outside of Thar Amphala."

03:15:17.495 --> 03:15:18.995
SAM: You don't go in?

03:15:18.995 --> 03:15:21.694
MATT: "I have not gone in since I gave my eye."

03:15:21.694 --> 03:15:28.032
SAM: And what are your people called? Your group,
your cult?

03:15:28.032 --> 03:15:29.781
MATT: "We are the Remnants."

03:15:29.781 --> 03:15:31.401
ASHLEY: What's his purpose?

03:15:31.401 --> 03:15:33.458
SAM: What's your job with the Remnants?

03:15:33.458 --> 03:15:42.143
MATT: "I am to watch the outskirts of the city. I
am to escort those who would bring various things

03:15:42.143 --> 03:15:44.137
"in preparation for the ritual."

03:15:44.137 --> 03:15:46.550
LAURA: What ritual? What is the ritual going to
do?

03:15:46.550 --> 03:15:48.523
SAM: What will the ritual do?

03:15:48.523 --> 03:16:00.143
MATT: "The ritual is to restore him. To bring him,
so that he can complete the main purpose. The

03:16:00.143 --> 03:16:02.200
"ritual of seeding."

03:16:02.200 --> 03:16:05.645
SAM: He's just a farmer, guys.

03:16:05.645 --> 03:16:13.094
LIAM: How does Delilah factor into it? What does
she get out of it? What does she do?

03:16:13.094 --> 03:16:15.062
SAM: I don't think he knows all of the
intricacies.

03:16:15.062 --> 03:16:17.249
LIAM: I know, but he's probably promised them all
something.

03:16:17.249 --> 03:16:21.454
SAM: What has Delilah promised you? What do you
gain out of this?

03:16:21.454 --> 03:16:33.044
MATT: "When he, the Undying King, returns to this
world, and we bring what we have gained, what we

03:16:33.044 --> 03:16:40.329
"have brought from the other plane, that seed will
be taken to the ritual of the space."

03:16:40.329 --> 03:16:41.786
LAURA: What have they brought?

03:16:41.786 --> 03:16:45.472
SAM: Did you bring something through the portal?
What was it?

03:16:45.472 --> 03:16:58.660
MATT: "I do not understand the details, but for
many months now, these siphons, they have been

03:16:58.660 --> 03:17:07.088
"building the seed. They have been preparing for
his return. And from there, he will complete what

03:17:07.088 --> 03:17:09.057
"he started so long ago."

03:17:09.057 --> 03:17:10.909
LAURA: And that shit's happening soon?

03:17:10.909 --> 03:17:12.877
SAM: When does the ritual begin?

03:17:12.877 --> 03:17:16.676
MATT: "Soon. Things accelerate."

03:17:16.676 --> 03:17:22.780
SAM: I know we look different now, but if you had
to pick one of us, which is the most handsome?

03:17:22.780 --> 03:17:25.486
MATT: "That would be you, my friend."

03:17:25.486 --> 03:17:26.887
SAM: I thought so.

03:17:26.887 --> 03:17:29.118
TRAVIS: Can he take us safely to the tower?

03:17:29.118 --> 03:17:33.727
SAM: Can you escort us to the tower? Dominate
Person has got to be wearing off.

03:17:33.727 --> 03:17:36.165
MATT: I'm checking the spell just to be sure.

03:17:36.165 --> 03:17:38.543
LAURA: We have a thing. We can at least get
through town.

03:17:38.543 --> 03:17:41.569
SAM: One minute. It's probably over.

03:17:41.569 --> 03:17:49.120
MATT: Yeah. So by about now, after these questions
have come through, his one eye blinks, and he

03:17:49.120 --> 03:17:58.581
goes, (grunt), "It matters not. He already knows
you're here."

03:17:58.581 --> 03:18:00.298
LIAM: I punch him in the temple again.

03:18:00.298 --> 03:18:04.470
LAURA: He likes it. Stop giving him pleasure.

03:18:04.470 --> 03:18:06.652
TRAVIS: I poke him in his remaining eyeball.

03:18:06.652 --> 03:18:10.887
MATT: Do you? Roll a strength check.

03:18:10.887 --> 03:18:14.030
LIAM: A strength check? For some Jello?

03:18:14.030 --> 03:18:16.147
TRAVIS: Oh God. 25.

03:18:16.147 --> 03:18:19.211
MATT: (shriek of pain)

03:18:19.211 --> 03:18:21.484
TALIESIN: I close the mouth.

03:18:21.484 --> 03:18:27.220
MATT: There is a smear of crimson down his face as
the other eye has just been turned to paste.

03:18:27.220 --> 03:18:29.248
LAURA: Wow, we're terrible people.

03:18:29.248 --> 03:18:33.228
TRAVIS: Oh, what was that? It matters not? Oh, are
you going to be rewarded? Yeah. How many middle

03:18:33.228 --> 03:18:35.041
fingers am I holding up?

03:18:35.041 --> 03:18:37.315
LAURA: We should put him out of his misery.

03:18:37.315 --> 03:18:38.849
TRAVIS: Why? I like misery.

03:18:38.849 --> 03:18:44.088
SAM: Well, if we just release him into the city
without his censer...

03:18:44.088 --> 03:18:47.574
LIAM: He's going to stumble out like a maniac.
Squish the bug, Grog.

03:18:47.574 --> 03:18:55.245
SAM: No, no. If we send him away from us, maybe
one of those things will find him and we'll have a

03:18:55.245 --> 03:18:56.624
clearer path.

03:18:56.624 --> 03:18:58.947
TRAVIS: He's yelling. He'll make all sorts of
sound.

03:18:58.947 --> 03:19:04.037
SAM: Yeah, if we send him away from us and then we
go the other way. He's a human distraction!

03:19:04.037 --> 03:19:07.338
TALIESIN: We don't need a distraction, we need
quiet at this point.

03:19:07.338 --> 03:19:10.993
LIAM: And those things, we don't know if they
could alert back if they saw something fishy like that.

03:19:10.993 --> 03:19:19.236
TALIESIN: I'll release him and you do your
business, all right? Manners.

03:19:19.236 --> 03:19:23.252
MATT: (mechanical clicking) It all unfolds and
returns into the sphere.

03:19:23.252 --> 03:19:24.571
TRAVIS: Great word.

03:19:24.571 --> 03:19:26.975
TALIESIN: Thank you. It's programmable.

03:19:26.975 --> 03:19:32.795
TRAVIS: Should we let you back out so you can find
your way back?

03:19:32.795 --> 03:19:37.511
MATT: "Do your worst."

03:19:37.511 --> 03:19:39.284
TRAVIS: (crack)

03:19:39.284 --> 03:19:44.739
MATT: With a sickening snap, you can hear as the
spinal column is severed at the base of the neck,

03:19:44.739 --> 03:19:47.623
and he goes limp in Grog's grasp.

03:19:47.623 --> 03:19:52.612
ASHLEY: Grab his necklace in case we need another
one for some reason.

03:19:52.612 --> 03:19:54.627
LAURA: Should we grab any cloaks?

03:19:54.627 --> 03:19:58.555
TALIESIN: Grab the necklaces and the cloaks and
the censer. All three of them.

03:19:58.555 --> 03:20:03.187
MATT: Actually, he has almost nothing on him but
the censer.

03:20:03.187 --> 03:20:05.119
MARISHA: No necklace?

03:20:05.119 --> 03:20:10.027
MATT: He has-- Actually, no, he would not have one
of the necklaces. Because he does not...

03:20:10.027 --> 03:20:11.435
MARISHA: Travel through?

03:20:11.435 --> 03:20:15.874
MATT: He has a symbol, a similar symbol, but it's
much smaller, more just a basic holy symbol of

03:20:15.874 --> 03:20:21.524
some kind. Same shape, but it doesn't have the
same thick iron presentation as the ones that you

03:20:21.524 --> 03:20:22.707
guys encountered.

03:20:22.707 --> 03:20:29.634
LAURA: I have a holy symbol to Vecna that we took
off of somebody in the original ziggurat.

03:20:29.634 --> 03:20:31.662
MATT: Yes, and that is the same symbol.

03:20:31.662 --> 03:20:32.965
LAURA: It is, okay.

03:20:32.965 --> 03:20:37.623
LIAM: We're in an ancient city. Are there the
remains of furniture in here?

03:20:37.623 --> 03:20:42.329
LAURA: I just want to take a nap or a cozy
sit-down.

03:20:42.329 --> 03:20:44.670
LIAM: No, I want to shove him in a closet or wrap
him up in something.

03:20:44.670 --> 03:20:46.851
TRAVIS: I'm putting him in the Bag of Holding as
you're talking.

03:20:46.851 --> 03:20:53.031
TALIESIN: We can't keep everything.

03:20:53.031 --> 03:20:56.902
LIAM: Does anybody see any-- Never mind.

03:20:56.902 --> 03:21:01.237
TALIESIN: Is there anything of interest in this
building, since we have a moment?

03:21:01.237 --> 03:21:02.895
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:21:02.895 --> 03:21:07.354
LIAM: I'm going to investigate, too, because I was
looking for furniture.

03:21:07.354 --> 03:21:08.695
TALIESIN: 15.

03:21:08.695 --> 03:21:15.741
LIAM: And I have advantage, hold on.
Investigation... 22.

03:21:15.741 --> 03:21:22.998
MATT: Okay. You do find some furniture. Most of
it's very basic, tables, maybe a couple chairs, a

03:21:22.998 --> 03:21:31.631
couple of cots that are mainly wood boards with a
thin cushion on it. The existence here was not to

03:21:31.631 --> 03:21:36.674
be-- It's a very plain city of worship. You can
see everything was built here to gather

03:21:36.674 --> 03:21:43.056
worshipers, to gather the Remnants, or whatever
they were called before, the last time that Vecna

03:21:43.056 --> 03:21:45.440
fell and the city was assaulted.

03:21:45.440 --> 03:21:49.623
LIAM: Right, so this is all worse than Fallout
Three at this point.

03:21:49.623 --> 03:21:50.924
MATT: It's on par with.

03:21:50.924 --> 03:21:55.863
LIAM: PlayStation Three graphics.

03:21:55.863 --> 03:22:01.800
TALIESIN: I say we make our way towards the
spire.

03:22:01.800 --> 03:22:12.464
MATT: So now, still under the guise of various
undead, holding a wandering burning censer

03:22:12.464 --> 03:22:23.679
procured from the now-dead, eye-popped corpse of a
wandering cultist, you slowly make your way deeper

03:22:23.679 --> 03:22:29.705
into the city of Thar Amphala, towards the tower
of Entropis, where seemingly the cult of the

03:22:29.705 --> 03:22:36.251
Remnant are attempting to bring Vecna back to
physical form for an even greater ritual

03:22:36.251 --> 03:22:43.627
thereafter. And that's where we'll finish
tonight's episode. We'll return next week to pick

03:22:43.627 --> 03:22:45.193
up from there, guys.

03:22:45.193 --> 03:22:47.713
LAURA: This is amazing!

03:22:47.713 --> 03:22:50.471
TRAVIS: This is the best setup ever!

03:22:50.471 --> 03:22:59.962
MATT: So happy. I know! I get to touch people's
hands!

03:22:59.962 --> 03:23:01.306
LIAM: Dorks!

03:23:01.306 --> 03:23:10.094
MATT: I know, we're such huge nerds. This feels so
much like the home game, it makes me happy.

03:23:10.094 --> 03:23:11.974
LIAM: Serious deja vu.

03:23:11.974 --> 03:23:13.958
TALIESIN: All it needs is honey and brie.

03:23:13.958 --> 03:23:17.776
LAURA: We could put food out in front of us!

03:23:17.776 --> 03:23:25.022
MATT: Next week, pajamas and mimosas. What better
way to celebrate a Vecna arc in the Shadowfell?

03:23:25.022 --> 03:23:27.232
LIAM: Bring your dog to work day!

03:23:27.232 --> 03:23:31.347
TALIESIN: PJ's, mimosas, and very old puppies?

03:23:31.347 --> 03:23:34.168
LIAM: And Charlie? Can Charlie come?

03:23:34.168 --> 03:23:35.846
LAURA: I think it's necessary.

03:23:35.846 --> 03:23:39.556
TALIESIN: Charlie can run Trinket.

03:23:39.556 --> 03:23:46.093
MATT: So guys, thank you so much. We're back next
week. I want to give another big thank you to the

03:23:46.093 --> 03:23:50.647
amazing crew and people here at Legendary/Geek and
Sundry that have been working almost around the

03:23:50.647 --> 03:23:55.918
clock to make this set work, to make this table
work, to make the equipment work, the lighting,

03:23:55.918 --> 03:24:00.889
the audio. We've taken all of your suggestions,
we've reached out to the community, to try and make

03:24:00.889 --> 03:24:06.909
this as best and as comfortable as possible for us
and you guys. I know it's a work in progress, and

03:24:06.909 --> 03:24:09.895
you'll watch things improve as we go, as we learn
and figure things out, so thank you for your

03:24:09.895 --> 03:24:14.345
patience. But seriously, if you get the
opportunity, show some appreciation for the people

03:24:14.345 --> 03:24:18.149
who've been working really hard to try and improve
this experience for everyone involved. Thank you

03:24:18.200 --> 03:24:19.789
guys, you're all so amazing.

03:24:19.789 --> 03:24:23.396
(cheers)

03:24:23.396 --> 03:24:32.348
MATT: In the meantime, I want to tell you all, I
love you very much. Happy 101st episode. And is it

03:24:32.348 --> 03:24:35.937
Thursday yet? Good night, guys!

03:24:35.937 --> 03:31:25.391
