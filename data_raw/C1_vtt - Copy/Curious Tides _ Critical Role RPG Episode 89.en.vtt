00:00:02.345 --> 00:00:05.974
MATT: And welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:05.974 --> 00:00:12.649
sit around and play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. Tonight's
gonna be a fun one. But before we jump into it--

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:15.761
LIAM: What does that mean? What does that mean?

00:00:15.805 --> 00:00:17.379
MATT: I don't know. We ended on an interesting
note.

00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:18.873
MARISHA: I think I just peed a little.

00:00:18.873 --> 00:00:19.855
MATT: Yeah.

00:00:19.855 --> 00:00:21.079
TRAVIS: Do y'all hear that heartbeat in your
ears?

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:22.069
MATT: It's weird.

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:22.736
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:00:22.736 --> 00:00:25.020
MATT: (heartbeat noise) But before we get to that,
let's go ahead and get to our opening

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.395
announcements. First and foremost, our glorious
returning sponsor for the evening,

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:31.229
our friends at Loot Crate!

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:33.072
ALL: Loot Crate!

00:00:33.072 --> 00:00:35.887
MATT: Fantastic, awesome people. Sam, is there
something you want to talk about?

00:00:35.887 --> 00:00:42.289
SAM: Yeah. You know, a lot of my Loot Crate plugs
have been comedic, or cute.

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:43.651
Some would say clever.

00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:44.834
TALIESIN: Debatable.

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:46.056
TRAVIS: I don't know if I'd go that far.

00:00:46.056 --> 00:00:50.020
SAM: But one thing that has been lacking is a
sense of spectacle. Of human achievement. Of

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.384
record breaking. So tonight I'm going to attempt
something that's never been attempted before. I'm

00:00:55.384 --> 00:01:00.251
going to do the Loot Crate copy read here. While
drinking an entire Coca-Cola.

00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:01.608
LIAM: Oh no.

00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:08.245
SAM: And a bite-sized 100 Grand bar, Snickers bar,
Milky Way, Twix, another bite-sized Snickers bar,

00:01:08.295 --> 00:01:12.297
a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, and a packet of Big
League Chew.

00:01:12.297 --> 00:01:13.150
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.817
LIAM: Oh no.

00:01:13.817 --> 00:01:14.741
LAURA: What? You're going to vomit.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:15.609
SAM: In two minutes.

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:16.604
LAURA: You're going to vomit, Sam.

00:01:16.604 --> 00:01:20.523
SAM: Also, all this stuff melted in my car.

00:01:20.523 --> 00:01:22.022
LIAM: Notice he's got a towel down.

00:01:22.022 --> 00:01:23.397
MARISHA: That's actually really gross-looking.

00:01:23.397 --> 00:01:24.711
LAURA: Oh god! He does have a towel down.

00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:25.791
TALIESIN: This looks unhappy.

00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:26.692
SAM: All right. Travis?

00:01:26.692 --> 00:01:27.306
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah.

00:01:27.306 --> 00:01:28.249
SAM: You got the clock ready?

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.738
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:33.286
SAM: Two minutes, can it be done? The answer is
no. (laughs) Ready?

00:01:33.286 --> 00:01:35.294
TRAVIS: Three, two, one.

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:40.883
SAM: Loot Crate is a curated collection of awesome
items from the best pop culture franchises

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:52.868
LAURA: Oh no.

00:01:52.868 --> 00:01:53.928
TRAVIS: You're doing good. You're doing good.

00:01:53.928 --> 00:01:54.773
LIAM: My god.

00:01:54.773 --> 00:01:55.607
LAURA: He's going to spew.

00:01:55.607 --> 00:01:56.346
MARISHA: At least it's a Mexico--

00:01:56.346 --> 00:01:57.749
TRAVIS: No, no, don't help him.

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:58.874
TALIESIN: Let it happen! Let it happen!

00:01:58.874 --> 00:01:59.943
SAM: Don't help me!

00:01:59.943 --> 00:02:01.018
MARISHA: No, we're good. It's better. It's
better.

00:02:01.018 --> 00:02:05.489
SAM: This week's crate theme is Primal. Featuring
awesome swag from X-Men, Overwatch and Predator.

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:06.731
TRAVIS: 30 seconds.

00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:15.712
SAM: Give yourself every month or give the gift of
geeking out to a friend or loved one. And if you

00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:24.743
LAURA: Don't do it!

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:26.387
TALIESIN: Big League Chew! No god!

00:02:26.387 --> 00:02:36.427
SAM: From collectibles [inaudible]. It's like
Comic-Con in a box!

00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:38.949
TRAVIS: One minute.

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:51.421
SAM: Oh boy! How do I separate the gum from the
other stuff? Loot Crate, Loot Crate DX, Loot

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:56.634
Gaming, and Loot Anime. How do you want to do
this?

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:59.243
LAURA: Did you do it? Did he just do it?

00:02:59.243 --> 00:03:00.191
TALIESIN: No, no, no.

00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:01.537
MATT: He's still got more Coke.

00:03:01.537 --> 00:03:02.345
TRAVIS: The Coke's gotta go.

00:03:02.408 --> 00:03:03.544
TALIESIN: Gotta go!

00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:04.762
SAM: It can't get in.

00:03:04.944 --> 00:03:12.766
TRAVIS: 30 seconds left! 30 seconds left! Work it.
Work! Relax the throat.

00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:15.666
SAM: Hold on. Not good.

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:17.271
LAURA: He's going to kill himself.

00:03:17.271 --> 00:03:18.713
MARISHA: Don't choke.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.071
SAM: Half left?!

00:03:20.071 --> 00:03:21.093
TRAVIS: 15 seconds.

00:03:21.093 --> 00:03:22.439
LAURA: Sam, get that shit out of your mouth. I'm
going to throw up.

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.635
SAM: I can't do it! I can't do it!

00:03:23.635 --> 00:03:24.381
TALIESIN: Don't look!

00:03:24.381 --> 00:03:25.309
MATT: 11!

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:32.710
TRAVIS: Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Don't
stop fighting for it!

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.400
TALIESIN: No matter what, we're going to think
less of you, it doesn't matter anymore.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.728
TRAVIS: Three! Two! One!

00:03:35.728 --> 00:03:36.708
LIAM: Happy new year!

00:03:36.708 --> 00:03:40.759
TRAVIS: That's it! That's it! That's it! Oh my
god, that's it.

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.950
TALIESIN: You get a participation ribbon. Well
done.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:51.357
LAURA: That was so fucking gross. Samuel!

00:03:55.315 --> 00:03:59.276
TRAVIS: Do we have an ambulance on standby?

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:02.793
TALIESIN: Five years from now, your children will
be able to Google this.

00:04:02.793 --> 00:04:05.283
I'm just going to remind you.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.803
MATT: If there was ever a moment in our show that
will be giffed and show up on GIPHY, that's it

00:04:11.803 --> 00:04:22.135
right there. Thank you, Sam. And thank you, Loot
Crate, for your fantastic sponsorship.

00:04:22.135 --> 00:04:24.793
LIAM: I feel like we just passed into performance
art, there.

00:04:24.793 --> 00:04:25.845
MATT: Yeah.

00:04:25.845 --> 00:04:31.959
SAM: Don't forget to use the code 'criticalrole'
for 10% off your Loot Crate monthly geek crate.

00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:34.715
TRAVIS: That entire tooth is brown.

00:04:34.715 --> 00:04:35.883
LAURA: I'm just going to throw up.

00:04:35.883 --> 00:04:38.493
TRAVIS: Your teeth are all brown!

00:04:38.493 --> 00:04:39.326
LAURA: It's so gross.

00:04:39.326 --> 00:04:42.320
MATT: I feel like that's an opening act to Gaga's
next tour.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.875
LIAM: Listen, real art makes you uncomfortable and
challenges you.

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:49.395
TRAVIS: The Super Bowl was missing that.

00:04:49.395 --> 00:04:51.247
MATT: Consider us challenged and uncomfortable.

00:04:51.247 --> 00:04:53.382
MARISHA: That made my eyes water and not in a good
way.

00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:55.683
TRAVIS: There's a part of the back of my head
that's cramped.

00:04:55.683 --> 00:04:56.732
MATT: Thank you Sam.

00:04:56.732 --> 00:04:58.481
TALIESIN: I'm no longer thinking about the game.
Well done. Yeah,

00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:00.523
not even thinking a little bit about the game.

00:05:00.523 --> 00:05:02.225
MATT: All right.

00:05:02.225 --> 00:05:04.130
SAM: I'll take care of this.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.499
TALIESIN: Just roll it up and burn it.

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:06.858
MARISHA: Do you wanna handle that?

00:05:06.858 --> 00:05:07.942
TALIESIN: You gonna finish that Coke?

00:05:07.942 --> 00:05:11.583
SAM: Oh, yeah.

00:05:11.583 --> 00:05:15.073
MATT: It's the only way to be sure. All right, so
last week we mentioned this, I wanna tell you guys

00:05:15.073 --> 00:05:19.281

more of our community winning everything, which is

00:05:46.172 --> 00:05:48.237
kind of our long-term plan, so.

00:05:48.237 --> 00:05:48.906
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:05:48.906 --> 00:05:49.758
MATT: Check it out.

00:05:49.758 --> 00:05:50.932
TRAVIS: Take over the world!

00:05:52.016 --> 00:05:56.090
MATT: Next up. Merch. Laura, do we have any
updates on that?

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.073
LAURA: (muffled) Aw man, I put food in my mouth!

00:05:58.073 --> 00:05:59.322
TRAVIS: What the fuck are you thinking? What're
you thinking?

00:05:59.322 --> 00:06:01.934
MATT: Quick, drink the Coke! Ten, nine, eight,
seven--

00:06:01.934 --> 00:06:05.195
MARISHA: I have one while she swallows.

00:06:05.195 --> 00:06:06.321
SAM: (belches)

00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:09.038
MATT: Oh, god!

00:06:09.038 --> 00:06:11.051
TRAVIS: The distance on that was incredible.

00:06:11.051 --> 00:06:12.565
MATT: My hair went (whoosh).

00:06:12.565 --> 00:06:14.577
LIAM: Hold on, Marisha. Are you okay?

00:06:14.577 --> 00:06:15.463
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm concerned.

00:06:15.463 --> 00:06:16.643
LIAM: Are you okay?

00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:17.574
SAM: I'm fine.

00:06:17.574 --> 00:06:18.633
TALIESIN: Why are we not talking about this?

00:06:18.633 --> 00:06:22.085
MARISHA: That sounded like something that happens
when you're diseased.

00:06:22.085 --> 00:06:24.484
TRAVIS: Yeah, I could feel your glycogen spike
from over here.

00:06:25.561 --> 00:06:28.238
MATT: Marisha, you were saying?

00:06:29.971 --> 00:06:36.419
MARISHA: This Saturday, it's the two-year
anniversary of the twitch stream.

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.158
(all cheer)

00:06:38.158 --> 00:06:39.774
TALIESIN: My, how time flies.

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:45.330
MARISHA: Yes, isn't that nice? And pleasant? And
not disgusting-looking? It's a 24-hour twitch

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:51.789
stream. There's gonna be a lot going on. There's
gonna be Gather Your Party, AXYB special, there's

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:54.705
gonna be Game the Game, and we're going to--

00:06:54.705 --> 00:06:56.185
TALIESIN: Breaded Men?

00:06:56.185 --> 00:06:57.655
MARISHA: Bearded Men, not Breaded Men.

00:06:57.655 --> 00:06:59.240
TALIESIN: Oh, I saw Breaded Men, I was very
excited.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:07.018
MARISHA: No, Bearded Men. And we are going to be
playing Mansions of Madness, some of us, here.

00:07:07.018 --> 00:07:09.715
Like around one o'clock.

00:07:09.715 --> 00:07:13.526
MATT: And the charity stream is benefiting 826LA.

00:07:13.526 --> 00:07:18.469
MARISHA: Yeah. Yes. And the whole thing is gonna
be charity-related, it's all gonna go to 826LA.

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:19.749
MATT: Our friends there since the beginning.

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:20.797
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:07:20.797 --> 00:07:22.528
MATT: So looking forward to that.

00:07:22.528 --> 00:07:26.317
MARISHA: Yeah, so donate, we're gonna be taking
donations, it's gonna be great.

00:07:26.317 --> 00:07:31.822
MATT: Exactly. And tomorrow at noon Pacific Time,
me and Darren De Paul are gonna be guesting on

00:07:31.822 --> 00:07:38.612
Eric's TBD RPG, the Doctor Who RPG, from noon to
3PM tomorrow Pacific, and then--

00:07:38.612 --> 00:07:39.817
OFF-SCREEN: High noon?

00:07:39.817 --> 00:07:42.980
(all groan)

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:43.977
MATT: And.

00:07:43.977 --> 00:07:46.446
(all laugh)

00:07:46.446 --> 00:07:47.839
LIAM: Put him in the game so you can kill him.

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:52.000
MATT: Okay, that's a good call. And it looks like
we'll also be continuing that game on Saturday

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.927
before the Mansions of Madness stream, from 11-1.
So I'll be here for five hours. Again. On

00:07:57.927 --> 00:08:03.428
Saturday. But it's gonna be a lot of fun, looking
forward to it, I'm excited to go guest on there

00:08:03.428 --> 00:08:07.740
and play for a little bit, so hopefully see you
guys tomorrow and Saturday.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.248
Let's see. Laura, now that you're--

00:08:09.248 --> 00:08:10.204
LAURA: Oh, hey!

00:08:10.204 --> 00:08:11.180
MATT: Hi.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.092
LAURA: How's it going, guys?

00:08:12.092 --> 00:08:12.939
MATT: Good, how're you doing?

00:08:12.939 --> 00:08:20.269
LAURA: We have a-- don't you touch my donuts. We
have all of the normal, wonderful stuff still

00:08:20.269 --> 00:08:24.622
available in the store. The stuff that's out of
stock, actually, has been removed so that you

00:08:24.622 --> 00:08:30.108
don't get confused when you're looking for things.
So we have our Gilmore shirt, we got our Strongjaw

00:08:30.108 --> 00:08:37.675
shirt, we got a 'How do you want to do this'
shirt, with the hoodie. We got baseball caps, we

00:08:37.675 --> 00:08:43.839
got patches, we got vinyl stickers, which I am
still a really big fan of. They go on windshields,

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:45.912
Macbooks, whatever you want.

00:08:45.912 --> 00:08:46.801
TRAVIS: Pets.

00:08:46.801 --> 00:08:48.550
LAURA: Pets! Not recommended.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.624
TRAVIS: Really?

00:08:49.624 --> 00:08:54.256
LAURA: So yeah, check it out if you wanna wear
your Critical Role goodies.

00:08:54.256 --> 00:08:56.598
LIAM: You're like an Italian grandmother in
Hoboken, New Jersey right now.

00:08:56.598 --> 00:08:57.514
LAURA: Ey!

00:08:57.514 --> 00:08:59.846
TRAVIS: Bada-bing!

00:08:59.846 --> 00:09:01.463
LAURA: Bada-bing, bada-boom, there you go.

00:09:01.463 --> 00:09:05.440
MATT: Moving on. The new Signal Boost came out,
with Jason Charles Miller as the host, our friend

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.901
who played Garthok for his temporary run during
the initial Conclave attack.

00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:11.230
TRAVIS: He is part of the Clasp.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.386
MATT: Yes. And he is--

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:13.568
MARISHA: And he did our theme music.

00:09:13.568 --> 00:09:17.540
MATT: He did our theme music for the show, here,
he's a very talented musician. And a good friend

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:25.362
of the show. And you can see his new run on Signal
Boost this week. New GM Tips is out today. My

00:09:25.362 --> 00:09:29.675
second-to-last on the run at this time. This
episode is more for the players, and deals with

00:09:29.675 --> 00:09:33.705
creating and running characters that are against
the normal tropes and the type that people

00:09:33.705 --> 00:09:37.750
generally fall into when creating a new character
in an RPG. So go check it out,

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:41.042
see if any of it seems to resonate.

00:09:41.042 --> 00:09:45.923
TALIESIN: This is how he criticizes us now, is he
makes a little web video and sends it to all of us

00:09:45.923 --> 00:09:47.555
instead of talking to us.

00:09:47.555 --> 00:09:48.869
MARISHA: Yeah, it's very passive aggressive.

00:09:48.869 --> 00:09:53.087
MATT: Took you a while to figure it out, Taliesin.
But I'm glad you finally did.

00:09:53.227 --> 00:09:55.167
TALIESIN: I'm feeling it.

00:09:55.167 --> 00:09:57.444
MATT: Also, Wednesday Club, Taliesin?

00:09:57.444 --> 00:10:02.660
TALIESIN: Yes, it turns out I have to record voice
over on occasion, so Wednesday Club is not going

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:08.585
to be me this week and I'll be talking to comic
books to the engineer who will be mildly irritated

00:10:08.585 --> 00:10:14.618
with me. But instead, you guys, Matt Key is going
to be hosting and he is going to talk about

00:10:14.618 --> 00:10:16.647
his favorite thing in the world.

00:10:16.706 --> 00:10:17.611
MATT: Doctor Strange.

00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:18.308
MARISHA: Doctor Strange.

00:10:18.308 --> 00:10:19.776
TALIESIN: -- his wife, and Doctor Strange, but
that's cool, too. Because him and his wife.

00:10:19.776 --> 00:10:21.067
MARISHA: Oh yeah, oh yeah, and his wife. And
Doctor Strange.

00:10:21.067 --> 00:10:22.502
TALIESIN: And Doctor Strange, his work wife.

00:10:22.502 --> 00:10:23.446
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:10:23.446 --> 00:10:25.211
TALIESIN: It's great and fun.

00:10:25.211 --> 00:10:27.681
MATT: Also, don't forget we have Talks Machina
live on Tuesday nights.

00:10:27.681 --> 00:10:28.830
(all cheer)

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:35.221
MATT: 7PM here on Twitch and Alpha, hosted by our
fantastic Brian Foster. So check us out next week

00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:40.360
to discuss this episode when it comes up. Last two
things: one, we mentioned it on Talks Machina, but

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.506
one of our fantastic crew members, Amandine, who's
currently trying to legally find a way to stay in

00:10:45.506 --> 00:10:51.704
this country, currently put up a Fundly, the fun
folks here, part of the cast and community put

00:10:51.704 --> 00:11:00.912
together a Fundly, fundly.com/we-love-amandine/ to
raise money to help with her legal costs and try

00:11:00.912 --> 00:11:06.481
keep her here and working with us. The community
has already been incredible. If you have any

00:11:06.481 --> 00:11:10.025
interest in help and support that, I recommend go
check it out and give what little that you can

00:11:10.025 --> 00:11:19.149
because it all helps. And last but not least we
got a gift today in the mail from a fantastic

00:11:19.149 --> 00:11:29.183
critter named Chris Capola who as part of an
anniversary present for me and Marisha built a

00:11:29.242 --> 00:11:36.616
treasure chest. Like from scratch, like cut down
the tree, trimmed, lathed...

00:11:36.616 --> 00:11:39.118
built a treasure chest.

00:11:39.289 --> 00:11:40.581
LAURA: It's amazing.

00:11:40.581 --> 00:11:41.984
TRAVIS: That's man-made wood right there.

00:11:41.984 --> 00:11:45.740
LAURA: We thought it was for all of us but then we
realized it was just for Matt and Marisha.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.631
LIAM: It's physically beautiful but just the
process we saw outlined is--

00:11:50.631 --> 00:11:52.236
LAURA: Phenomenal.

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:53.856
LIAM: Beautiful, beautiful gift.

00:11:53.856 --> 00:11:58.160
MATT: So Chris, thank you, tremendously, from all
of us, but mostly me and Marisha.

00:11:58.216 --> 00:12:01.724
(all laugh)

00:12:01.724 --> 00:12:04.650
LIAM: I'm going to take a dump in that box, at
your house, the first opportunity I get.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:05.779
(all laugh)

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:07.575
LAURA: No!

00:12:10.071 --> 00:12:16.505
MATT: That is absolutely brilliant, and undeserved
and very happy to find a very wonderful place in

00:12:16.585 --> 00:12:22.106
our home to fill it with awesome nerdy shit. Thank you
guys. All right, I think that's the end of our

00:12:22.253 --> 00:12:24.045
announcements. That being the case.

00:12:24.045 --> 00:12:25.769
ALL: No, no, no, no!

00:12:25.769 --> 00:12:26.480
MATT: Let's jump in--

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.159
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

00:12:27.159 --> 00:12:28.174
MATT: -- to tonight's episode--

00:12:28.174 --> 00:12:29.115
ALL: No, no, no, no!

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:30.175
MATT: -- of Critical Role.

00:12:30.175 --> 00:12:31.393
(all cheer)

00:12:31.393 --> 00:14:02.812
[opening credits]

00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:10.576
MATT: And welcome back. So, picking up where we
left off this last episode, Vox Machina had

00:14:10.643 --> 00:14:16.557
made their way west into the Ozmit Sea, to the
islands of Anamn and to the city of Vesrah, the

00:14:16.602 --> 00:14:23.078
final stop in Keyleth's long-running Aramente. To
prove herself leader of her people of Zephra. Here

00:14:23.078 --> 00:14:28.957
they were given a task, as part of the Aramente,
where they had to retrieve three lodestones within the

00:14:28.957 --> 00:14:35.138
rift of the water elemental plane, which as of
late had been taken up residence by a kraken, an

00:14:35.185 --> 00:14:43.606
ancient pet of the Titans, now freed and left to
wander, to feed, grow, and apparently loom across

00:14:43.606 --> 00:14:53.833
that boundary. The party went in and, due to an
unfortunate vomiting episode underwater, drew the

00:14:53.833 --> 00:14:56.760
attention of the kraken.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.407
LAURA: Did you plan that?

00:14:58.407 --> 00:14:59.365
SAM: What?

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:02.049
LAURA: That you were almost vomiting today, and
you vomited and ruined our lives?

00:15:02.049 --> 00:15:06.754
SAM: I just plan to vomit every week. At least
once.

00:15:06.754 --> 00:15:11.041
MATT: It's for the best, I think. However, drew
the attention of the kraken, and a very, very

00:15:11.041 --> 00:15:17.974
intense battle ensued, in which most of you
managed to escape by the skin of your teeth,

00:15:17.974 --> 00:15:27.231
however, in the battle, Vax did fall, his body
left cold and lifeless beneath the waters. In a

00:15:27.231 --> 00:15:32.890
last-minute urge of leadership, Keyleth reached
out, grabbed the twins, and Planeshifted back into

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:42.444
the prime material plane, with Percival, Taryon,
and Grog looking to escape. You managed to be

00:15:42.444 --> 00:15:47.037
vomited up with, apparently, almost no hit points
left, and jumped through the portal while flicking

00:15:47.037 --> 00:15:49.034
off the kraken as--

00:15:49.034 --> 00:15:49.904
TRAVIS: Double-birds.

00:15:49.904 --> 00:15:50.688
LIAM: Badass.

00:15:50.688 --> 00:15:55.424
MATT: And that was where we left off. So. Before
we get into this--

00:15:55.424 --> 00:15:59.688
SAM: Wait, what? There's a before?

00:15:59.688 --> 00:16:00.560
MATT: Vax.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.515
MARISHA: Oh, no.

00:16:01.515 --> 00:16:02.764
LAURA: You!

00:16:02.764 --> 00:16:04.273
SAM: Bastard.

00:16:04.273 --> 00:16:11.888
MATT: As you feel the cold waters rush around you,
and your vision go dark, even as the

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:20.500
unconsciousness takes you, your vision narrows and
tunnels until it's just nothing. And while you

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:29.588
were floating before, the cold temperature begins
to become warm. It's a familiar warmth. And as

00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:34.006
opposed to being in water, there is no resistance,
you are just in a dark space. You can look down,

00:16:34.006 --> 00:16:40.402
and you can now see your hands. And you recall,
and you remember this. You've been here before.

00:16:40.402 --> 00:16:48.259
This is very reminiscent of your first journey
into the blood pool, your first true communion

00:16:48.259 --> 00:16:53.458
with the Raven Queen. And the moment you make that
realization, as you're looking at your hands, you

00:16:53.458 --> 00:16:57.777
watch as something dull and white arises from the
darkness below you, and you look down and see the

00:16:57.777 --> 00:17:04.951
massive porcelain mask of the Raven Queen emerge
from the shadows, tendrils of darkness spilling

00:17:04.951 --> 00:17:14.355
off the edges and the corners. As you watch the
stone face of the Raven Queen rise up to meet

00:17:14.355 --> 00:17:21.160
yours, what seemed immense suddenly seems small.
And as the shadow pulls away, you can see the

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:27.367
tumbles of jet-black hair falling past the
shoulders, the long, raven-feather-woven--

00:17:27.367 --> 00:17:30.702
[no audio]

00:17:30.702 --> 00:17:37.249
MATT: -- gathers and then vanishes into the
impossible darkness behind her. The hands reach

00:17:37.249 --> 00:17:43.760
out and take you by the sides of the head, and you
hear the voice once again emanating, sourceless,

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:55.651
ringing from all around you. It says, "My
champion. It seems you've stepped to return to me.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.505
"But what is your destined thread to be?"

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:03.998
Grog, as you come jumping through 
the portal and turn to

00:18:03.998 --> 00:18:08.687
flick off the kraken, you watch as one of its
tendrils begins to-- one of its final tentacles

00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:12.136
that's still there pulls through and begins to try
and grab one of the sides of

00:18:12.136 --> 00:18:15.451
the rock lodestone pillars.

00:18:15.451 --> 00:18:16.505
TRAVIS: Oh no!

00:18:16.505 --> 00:18:20.809
MATT: The other guardians, half merfolk, half
various individuals, rush forward and begin

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:27.530
stabbing at it, as it begins to get its beak
snapping right at the interior of this portal. You

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:31.970
see it starting to flex and the energy beginning
to pulse, it's almost trying and force its way

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:37.144
through a much smaller opening. Percival, Grog,
Taryon, what are you guys doing?

00:18:37.144 --> 00:18:38.997
SAM: Oh, shit. We have to do stuff?

00:18:38.997 --> 00:18:40.249
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

00:18:40.249 --> 00:18:43.849
TALIESIN: I'm still underwater, aren't I?

00:18:43.849 --> 00:18:45.852
MATT: You all are still underwater, yes.

00:18:45.852 --> 00:18:49.017
TRAVIS: Does this happen a lot?

00:18:49.017 --> 00:18:52.654
MATT: The guardians right now are just shouting
and screaming and stabbing at the tentacle.

00:18:52.654 --> 00:18:55.588
TRAVIS: (yells) A lot of that? There's a lot of
just open-mouthed (yells)?

00:18:55.588 --> 00:18:59.803
MATT: Yeah, the guard's like, "Argh! Quick! Push
it back!" They're all stabbing it. The one

00:18:59.803 --> 00:19:02.812
tentacle finally snaps and withdraws inside.

00:19:02.812 --> 00:19:05.713
TRAVIS: We could just go, we could just leave,
it's just fine. It's good.

00:19:05.713 --> 00:19:09.786
MATT: The mouth pulls back, and now the whole body
shifts over, and you see the one giant eye from

00:19:09.786 --> 00:19:11.274
one side of the kraken come peering through--

00:19:11.274 --> 00:19:12.573
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck that noise.

00:19:12.573 --> 00:19:18.628
TALIESIN: I am dragging Taryon-- and you, if I can
drag you as well-- we're walking away.

00:19:18.628 --> 00:19:23.949
TRAVIS: The eyeball's soft, let me throw one more
time at the eyeball. Yeah, I throw the hammer at

00:19:23.949 --> 00:19:24.998
the eyeball.

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:26.486
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an attack.

00:19:26.486 --> 00:19:28.148
TRAVIS: Okay. Reckless!

00:19:28.148 --> 00:19:31.627
MATT: Reckless. Okay, so you had disadvantage
underwater, so it's just one roll.

00:19:31.627 --> 00:19:34.834
TRAVIS: Ah, balls. 23.

00:19:34.834 --> 00:19:35.841
MATT: That'll hit.

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:36.963
TRAVIS: Nice!

00:19:36.963 --> 00:19:40.057
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

00:19:40.057 --> 00:19:42.148
TRAVIS: I meant two-handed. Oh no, I'm throwing
it.

00:19:42.148 --> 00:19:43.434
MATT: You're throwing it.

00:19:43.434 --> 00:19:45.704
(music flares up)

00:19:45.704 --> 00:19:47.742
LAURA: There it is.

00:19:47.742 --> 00:19:49.089
MATT: This connector's a little wonky.

00:19:49.089 --> 00:19:53.840
TRAVIS: 21 points of damage. I'm still enlarged,
right?

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.169
MATT: You are, yes.

00:19:56.169 --> 00:19:58.202
TRAVIS: 25 points of damage.

00:19:58.202 --> 00:20:04.484
MATT: 25. Whack! As you release the hammer, it
goes Thor-style just head-first, piercing through

00:20:04.484 --> 00:20:09.908
the water, and (impact sound) into the open eye of
the kraken as it slams shut. You hear the (groan)

00:20:09.908 --> 00:20:15.669
as it reels back and the voice pierces through the
rift towards you and most of the people in the

00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:23.597
vicinity one more time, saying, "I'm coming soon
enough." And as it pulls back, the remainder of

00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:27.047
the guardians go ahead and reach over, each
putting hands on the lodestones, and shift them

00:20:27.047 --> 00:20:32.038
slightly in place, and you watch as the rift
crackles and then doesn't slam entirely shut, but

00:20:32.038 --> 00:20:36.816
the image you had of the water elemental plane
suddenly grows a little more opaque and difficult

00:20:36.873 --> 00:20:38.473
to make out the discerning details.

00:20:38.473 --> 00:20:40.301
TRAVIS: Did I manage to (thump sound)?

00:20:40.301 --> 00:20:41.245
MATT: Yeah, your hammer does return.

00:20:41.245 --> 00:20:47.987
TRAVIS: Oh, thank god. Well, we all give something
every once in awhile.

00:20:47.987 --> 00:20:53.959
MATT: So, as you're carrying the-- which you
were--

00:20:53.959 --> 00:20:55.563
SAM: He resuscitated me, I believe?

00:20:55.563 --> 00:20:56.262
MATT: Yes.

00:20:56.262 --> 00:20:57.137
SAM: I have six points.

00:20:57.137 --> 00:21:02.892
MATT: Yes. So, conscious, horribly beaten. It
seems that the kraken has been beaten back, and

00:21:02.892 --> 00:21:07.356
currently the lode-stones are utilized to keep the
rift in check. You're uncertain as to whether or

00:21:07.356 --> 00:21:12.261
not the threat of the kraken was an idle threat or
whatever else it has planned, but regardless,

00:21:12.261 --> 00:21:13.409
that's the least of your worries.

00:21:13.409 --> 00:21:14.582
TALIESIN: Did we all hear it?

00:21:14.582 --> 00:21:16.004
SAM: Hear what?

00:21:16.004 --> 00:21:17.143
TALIESIN: The kraken.

00:21:17.143 --> 00:21:18.498
TRAVIS: 'Cause he mind-speaks, right?

00:21:18.498 --> 00:21:19.320
MATT: It would've been--

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.251
TRAVIS: It brain-talks.

00:21:20.251 --> 00:21:22.251
MATT: It would've been primarily to you, Grog, and
some of the other guardians nearby.

00:21:22.251 --> 00:21:23.606
TALIESIN: Okay. That's good.

00:21:23.606 --> 00:21:30.608
TRAVIS: Well, he was not happy in the end, there.
But he recognized true power

00:21:30.608 --> 00:21:35.424
and he was sorry to see us go.

00:21:35.424 --> 00:21:43.979
MATT: As soon as you've had this conversation, you
turn and look to the left and you see Durent there

00:21:43.979 --> 00:21:50.055
who is waiting and goes, "Where is the rest of
them? Where's the rest? Where's Keyleth?"

00:21:50.055 --> 00:21:55.359
TALIESIN: They-- they--

00:21:55.359 --> 00:21:57.001
TRAVIS: They distappeared.

00:21:57.001 --> 00:21:58.068
TALIESIN: They went away.

00:21:58.068 --> 00:22:00.314
LAURA: (laughs) Distappeared.

00:22:00.314 --> 00:22:04.924
MATT: "Well, let's hope that they know where
they're going, at the very least.

00:22:04.924 --> 00:22:07.350
"Any idea where they went?"

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:10.449
TALIESIN: Can we breathe some air? Please?

00:22:10.449 --> 00:22:17.730
MATT: "Aye, aye, all right, follow me, follow me."
And he starts leading the swimming cavalcade of

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:22.495
individuals that are leading you up to the top of
Vesrah. Back up through the Aerie of Torrent,

00:22:22.495 --> 00:22:29.467
through the various tubes and tunnels of the reef
that leads towards the surface of the Ozmit Sea.

00:22:29.467 --> 00:22:38.921
Simultaneously, Keyleth, Vex, and the lifeless
body of Vax, you apparate roughly ten feet above

00:22:38.921 --> 00:22:44.063
the surface of the water on the outskirts of
Vesrah. Tumble a bit, and splash into the

00:22:44.063 --> 00:22:51.663
foot-and-a-half shallow waters on the outskirts.
As you all get up for a minute and think about

00:22:51.663 --> 00:22:59.465
your circumstance. Vex, you look down and you see
your brother, face-down in the water, floating.

00:22:59.465 --> 00:23:04.374
LAURA: I flip him over and look at him. Vax! Vax,
wake up!

00:23:04.374 --> 00:23:07.347
MARISHA: Come on. Come on. We have to get him out
of this environment. Come on.

00:23:07.347 --> 00:23:08.646
LAURA: Is there a cleric on the island?

00:23:08.646 --> 00:23:14.960
MARISHA: Yes. Before I do anything, I am going to
throw up a Sky Write above the city.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.797
LAURA: I start dragging his body.

00:23:16.797 --> 00:23:26.612
MARISHA: And it says, "Help. Cleric." That works.
They'll get the idea. Hold on to him. Get on. I am

00:23:26.612 --> 00:23:32.853
going to turn into my giant raven form again.

00:23:32.853 --> 00:23:34.245
LAURA: How big is that?

00:23:34.245 --> 00:23:37.534
MARISHA: It's like the giant eagle form. I just
kind of modify it for style.

00:23:37.534 --> 00:23:38.465
LAURA: That's tight.

00:23:38.465 --> 00:23:43.128
MATT: Okay, so using the stats of a giant eagle
but you're going into a raven-type form.

00:23:43.128 --> 00:23:44.241
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:44.241 --> 00:23:45.263
MATT: Okay.

00:23:45.263 --> 00:23:46.189
MARISHA: Black feathers.

00:23:46.189 --> 00:23:46.957
TRAVIS: Good.

00:23:46.957 --> 00:23:48.013
MARISHA: All that coolness. Yeah.

00:23:48.013 --> 00:23:48.858
TRAVIS: It's all about branding.

00:23:48.858 --> 00:23:49.879
MARISHA: Yeah. A hundred percent.

00:23:49.879 --> 00:23:50.728
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:23:50.728 --> 00:23:52.566
MATT: Okay. And what're you doing?

00:23:52.566 --> 00:23:53.448
MARISHA: Gotta be on-message.

00:23:53.448 --> 00:23:56.345
LAURA: Where are we going?

00:23:56.345 --> 00:24:01.104
MARISHA: I fly off towards the center of the city,
towards where the entrance of the portal was,

00:24:01.104 --> 00:24:04.534
'cause I'm assuming there would be sages and
clerics waiting there.

00:24:04.534 --> 00:24:06.150
MATT: Well, the portal is beneath the city.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:07.610
MARISHA: I know but there is like a--

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:12.347
MATT: There is the central chamber in the middle
of the city, which is where it seemed the base of

00:24:12.347 --> 00:24:19.402
where the social gatherings seemed to occur. And
the centerpiece was where Uvenda and many of the

00:24:19.402 --> 00:24:22.622
other keepers of the city seemed to frequent.

00:24:22.622 --> 00:24:23.585
MARISHA: I'll head there.

00:24:23.585 --> 00:24:27.147
MATT: Okay. So you watch as the giant raven takes
off.

00:24:27.147 --> 00:24:28.832
LAURA: Oh no, I'm holding onto her, right?

00:24:28.832 --> 00:24:29.672
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:29.672 --> 00:24:30.463
MATT: Okay, so you're holding onto her.

00:24:30.463 --> 00:24:32.571
MARISHA: She's holding onto him and we're riding
there.

00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:35.661
MATT: Okay, I see. I got you. Okay so you climb
onto the back of the giant raven, clutching your

00:24:35.661 --> 00:24:43.806
brother in one arm, and as the wings pick up, you
use all the might that you have to just hold on.

00:24:43.806 --> 00:24:48.631
You're used to flying under your own power
usually, not somebody else's. But as the wings

00:24:48.631 --> 00:24:55.391
take off, the sea breeze, thankfully, is not too
heavy that day. And as you coast in, coming down,

00:24:55.391 --> 00:25:01.198
dodging between the various buildings heading
towards the central risen chamber. You watch as

00:25:01.198 --> 00:25:08.773
the upper, third-tier level of this, there's a
single chamber that is open and the outside wall

00:25:08.773 --> 00:25:12.719
is a series of pillars that makes up the
structure. On the inside, you can see it dips down

00:25:12.719 --> 00:25:19.705
into three different sunken platforms, and in the
center there are a handful of small statues,

00:25:19.705 --> 00:25:27.361
there's incense being burned, and what looks to be
a small altar of some kind. There are four figures

00:25:27.361 --> 00:25:34.397
there inside, all dressed in similar blues and
greens, aquas and whites, most of them are just

00:25:34.397 --> 00:25:42.666
long robes with dangling shell-based jewelry, and
various smoothed-off stones that have been found

00:25:42.666 --> 00:25:49.045
tossed and rounded by the elements through the
years. And in the center of the chamber, in the

00:25:49.045 --> 00:25:54.545
process of lighting a few of these, you're not
quite sure of the material, but they appear to be

00:25:54.545 --> 00:26:00.499
candles, as you see they're being lit like
candles. You see Uvenda is walking with her staff,

00:26:00.499 --> 00:26:07.734
taking this long burning tube, and is currently
setting them alight as you approach. As the wings

00:26:07.734 --> 00:26:13.510
of the raven begin to prepare for landing, the
wind kicks up in front and you see some of the

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:18.196
other guardians put their arm up and look up
curiously. Some of them reaching back and

00:26:18.196 --> 00:26:23.671
preparing for whatever may be there. Uvenda's
voice however rings out across the center of this

00:26:23.671 --> 00:26:30.869
chamber and says, "Stop! Stop. I know this one who
approaches." And as they all slowly back up,

00:26:30.869 --> 00:26:38.817
Uvenda stumbles upward, sets aside her small
hand-based wick to one of the servants and

00:26:38.817 --> 00:26:44.017
approaches the raven as you begin to slink off the
side of the bird.

00:26:44.017 --> 00:26:47.720
LAURA: Please! Are there any clerics here?

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:55.007
MATT: "We do have some here of a healing-based
nature. Yes. Has he been hurt?"

00:26:55.007 --> 00:26:59.406
LAURA: He's-- He's dead.

00:26:59.406 --> 00:27:05.672
MATT: She slowly approaches and reaches over and
puts her hand on the forehead of Vax's corpse.

00:27:05.672 --> 00:27:15.508
Runs her thumb along the cold skin. "Indeed. The
kraken claims another."

00:27:15.579 --> 00:27:21.817
LAURA: No. No, he won't claim him. What can we
do?

00:27:24.967 --> 00:27:32.342
MATT: "The power that is at our disposal could
perhaps bring him back, though his form may be

00:27:32.497 --> 00:27:34.950
"different than you recall."

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:37.641
MARISHA: I drop my form.

00:27:37.641 --> 00:27:44.303
MATT: All right. The feathers scatter off as
Keyleth is now returned to her half-elf image.

00:27:44.303 --> 00:27:53.461
MARISHA: Do you have means of traveling quickly?
We have a friend who is a cleric. Can you get us

00:27:53.608 --> 00:28:01.327
to her there and back quickly? Or someone who can
Tree Stride me there and bring her back? I'm

00:28:01.327 --> 00:28:10.413
exhausted or else I would do it myself. Please?
Please?

00:28:10.413 --> 00:28:17.537
MATT: "I have not a means of travel, but we could
reach out to someone."

00:28:17.537 --> 00:28:19.586
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. Any--

00:28:19.586 --> 00:28:22.386
MATT: "All right." And she walks back to the
altar, and you can see where there are a series of

00:28:22.386 --> 00:28:26.666
these statues. There's four of them in the center
and there's one large statue in the center. And

00:28:26.666 --> 00:28:34.430
the center statue, it looks almost like 
long-petrified reef. It's white, it's porous, it looks

00:28:34.487 --> 00:28:41.828
like the long-dead reef. But it seems to swirl
into a tree-like shape. It's this weird merging of

00:28:41.828 --> 00:28:47.568
sea and forest-based imagery, and as each various
portion of the tree outstretches, you see various

00:28:47.568 --> 00:28:55.940
baubles are hanging from it. You see stones,
necklaces, notes. Uvenda sets her staff to the

00:28:55.940 --> 00:29:04.124
side and her small, slightly arched form begins to
slowly crawl up the side of the tree, and it looks

00:29:04.124 --> 00:29:08.369
a bit physically arduous for her but nobody offers
to help. You see that this is something that she's

00:29:08.369 --> 00:29:12.396
done often and is part of her job as the guardian
here in Vesrah.

00:29:12.396 --> 00:29:18.870
MARISHA: While she does this, I come over the
earpiece and I say, Grog, Percy, quick, get back up

00:29:18.917 --> 00:29:20.852
to the central tower. Quick.

00:29:20.852 --> 00:29:23.964
LAURA: How do we even know they're alive?

00:29:23.964 --> 00:29:26.827
MARISHA: I am trusting that they are.

00:29:26.827 --> 00:29:30.180
MATT: With the distance of the earpiece, you can
hear them. Yes.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.890
TALIESIN: We're on our way.

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:35.797
MARISHA: Oh thank god. Thank god. Is everyone
still alive down there?

00:29:35.797 --> 00:29:38.454
TALIESIN: Barely. Yes, for the moment.

00:29:38.454 --> 00:29:44.597
MARISHA: Vax is down. So hurry.

00:29:44.597 --> 00:29:48.255
TALIESIN: We're on our way.

00:29:48.255 --> 00:29:53.748
MATT: As you're finishing the statement, you watch
as Uvenda is climbing down with one hand and has

00:29:53.748 --> 00:29:59.763
something cradled in her left arm as she's like
(grunts), almost slips for a minute and sets

00:29:59.763 --> 00:30:06.905
herself down back on both her feet and rubs her
lower back. "You'll get there one day."

00:30:06.951 --> 00:30:09.474
LAURA: Please hurry.

00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:12.701
MATT: And she unfurls her arm, and you can see
there's a conch shell. A small conch shell, but a

00:30:12.701 --> 00:30:15.751
conch shell. And she goes,

00:30:15.751 --> 00:30:21.233
"Whoever you're wishing to speak to, think of 
them and whisper it into the shell."

00:30:25.463 --> 00:30:33.728
MARISHA: Pike. Pike, if you can hear me, we need
you, now, in Vesrah. Please, it's Vax.

00:30:37.358 --> 00:30:38.700
LAURA: How do we know if it worked?

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:42.441
MARISHA: Yeah? I second that statement.

00:30:42.441 --> 00:30:51.896
MATT: "She'll hear you. It's up to her whether or
not she can act." And she hands the conch over to

00:30:51.896 --> 00:31:00.945
one of the assistants, takes her staff back up.
"Now, we offer the service still, should you not

00:31:00.945 --> 00:31:08.545
"hear anything. We are more than willing to try and
restore him to whatever form we can."

00:31:08.545 --> 00:31:15.523
LAURA: How much time does-- How long is too long?

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:20.938
MARISHA: I don't want to wait too long. Let's just
wait a little while longer and see if we hear

00:31:20.938 --> 00:31:29.409
anything from Pike. She's very smart. She'll hear
us.

00:31:30.579 --> 00:31:33.261
LAURA: I start brushing his hair off of his face.

00:31:33.261 --> 00:31:37.177
MARISHA: While she does that, I start gathering
the feathers and start laying them out as a bed

00:31:37.177 --> 00:31:40.285
around Vax, and preparing the station.

00:31:40.285 --> 00:31:45.183
MATT: Okay, so the scattered remnants of your
transformation, the raven feathers that were

00:31:45.183 --> 00:31:51.744
shunted from your form, you begin to form into a
bed-like place to set his body on. Okay. While you

00:31:51.744 --> 00:31:57.247
guys are doing that, Durent finally breaks the
surface of the water, where you were originally

00:31:57.247 --> 00:32:03.035
brought down into the Aerie of Torrent. And after
you've all hit the surface and breathed out, the

00:32:03.035 --> 00:32:11.073
bright midday sun is coming down, the smell of sea
air hits you. You hear the distant cawing of

00:32:11.073 --> 00:32:16.773
various ocean shore birds. It's a welcome change
of pace from the murky depths of the water

00:32:16.959 --> 00:32:24.517
elemental plane you've been facing for the past
few moments. As soon as you emerge, Durent steps

00:32:24.517 --> 00:32:32.404
up onto the sand, turns around, shakes and brushes
his hair off. "All right. Well, that's the end of

00:32:32.404 --> 00:32:35.129
"my watch. I don't know what to do."

00:32:35.129 --> 00:32:39.338
TRAVIS: Could you point us in the direction of
where your healers would be?

00:32:39.338 --> 00:32:45.280
MATT: "Healers?" And he points over to the large
ascending central structure in Vesrah. The one

00:32:45.479 --> 00:32:50.936
above where you guys had dinner the night before.
"That's your best bet there. That's where Uvenda

00:32:50.936 --> 00:32:53.695
"is, at least. She can help you more than I do. I
spend most of my time on the outskirts,

00:32:53.695 --> 00:32:57.318
"or down below."

00:32:57.318 --> 00:33:01.117
TRAVIS: Right. Thank you for watching our backs in
there, that was real hairy, but we have to be

00:33:01.117 --> 00:33:03.018
leaving you now.

00:33:03.018 --> 00:33:04.170
MATT: "Oh, understood."

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:06.134
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:33:06.134 --> 00:33:11.376
MATT: "Hope everything's okay." And he gives you a
nod and steps over to the side and watches as you

00:33:11.376 --> 00:33:23.106
guys go, as he retrieves one of his Waverunner
sailing boards, and watches with a look of

00:33:23.106 --> 00:33:29.663
intensity and worry on his brow, as his dark
dwarven complexion vanishes in the distance. You

00:33:29.663 --> 00:33:34.702
guys approaching, rushing in towards the center of
the city. As you begin to approach, you watch as

00:33:34.702 --> 00:33:40.703
Doty, who's been waiting patiently off to the
side, comes up to you and is holding the book out,

00:33:40.703 --> 00:33:43.435
and starts thumbing through page after page after
page.

00:33:43.435 --> 00:33:49.848
SAM: Ah, yes, Doty, thank you. I'll review this
all later. How many pages did you fill?

00:33:49.848 --> 00:33:54.856
MATT: He goes past about 25 different pages, in
very very tiny script, that goes into detail about

00:33:54.856 --> 00:34:03.512
the tides going in, each person that went in and
out of the water, anything he saw in the further

00:34:03.512 --> 00:34:10.482
distance, various birds from the sky. He does have
a few spatterings of white bird excrement across

00:34:10.482 --> 00:34:11.547
the top of his armor.

00:34:11.547 --> 00:34:14.558
SAM: Sure he does.

00:34:14.558 --> 00:34:17.564
MATT: He seems as proud as an automaton could.

00:34:17.564 --> 00:34:23.580
SAM: Very well done, Doty, thank you. We'll have
much more to write tonight, so save some energy

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:30.322
for that. Will you-- Will you carry me?

00:34:30.833 --> 00:34:40.291
MATT: He sweeps you up in a full-on princess
carry, and begins running after Percival and Grog,

00:34:40.291 --> 00:34:48.127
towards the center of Vesrah. You guys reach the
base of this. There are all the open stone

00:34:48.127 --> 00:34:52.640
pavilions, the central gathering areas, where you
now see people starting to look up curiously,

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:56.578
coming out of their various homes and places,
noticing all this commotion happening on the top

00:34:56.578 --> 00:35:05.891
of the temple. You watch as there is a spattering
of dark feathers up the top. And you guys begin to

00:35:05.891 --> 00:35:11.292
ascend one of the two spiral staircases that
ascends to the upper level of the temple.

00:35:11.292 --> 00:35:15.046
Eventually you guys come to the surface, you're
immediately greeted by one of the guards who is on

00:35:15.046 --> 00:35:19.298
guard currently with one of their spears. And upon
recognizing you, he kind of steps aside and lets

00:35:19.298 --> 00:35:26.008
you in, and that's where you guys watch as Keyleth
and Vex are laying Vax down onto a kind of

00:35:26.008 --> 00:35:28.443
makeshift bed of black feathers.

00:35:34.662 --> 00:35:36.902
SAM: What? Am I there?

00:35:36.902 --> 00:35:38.897
MATT: You're there. You're still in Doty's arms.

00:35:38.897 --> 00:35:49.024
SAM: Doty, down. What happened? What's going on?
Is he dead?

00:35:49.024 --> 00:35:52.842
TRAVIS: Yeah. This is what happens when you
adventure.

00:35:52.842 --> 00:35:54.106
TALIESIN: Keyleth, what--

00:35:54.106 --> 00:35:55.791
SAM: Oh god.

00:35:55.791 --> 00:35:59.230
MARISHA: She'll come. She'll come.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:00.222
TRAVIS: Who?

00:36:00.222 --> 00:36:01.517
TALIESIN: Are there other options?

00:36:01.517 --> 00:36:03.135
MARISHA: I'm waiting for Pike. She'll come.

00:36:03.135 --> 00:36:04.563
TALIESIN: Are there other options?

00:36:04.563 --> 00:36:05.616
MARISHA: Pike will come.

00:36:05.616 --> 00:36:07.287
LAURA: There are other options.

00:36:07.287 --> 00:36:10.103
MARISHA: But they're not good enough. Pike will
come.

00:36:10.103 --> 00:36:14.805
LAURA: I don't care what he looks like. I just
want him back.

00:36:14.805 --> 00:36:21.266
MARISHA: Pike will come. I don't want to do this
without Pike. She'll come.

00:36:21.266 --> 00:36:24.795
MATT: Uvenda at this point is starting to gather
some of the servants and they're starting to take

00:36:24.795 --> 00:36:32.813
down certain baubles and trinkets from the tree
branches and setting them in a vicinity around,

00:36:32.813 --> 00:36:39.282
and as she does so she's like, "These represent
protection of the waves." They take some small

00:36:39.282 --> 00:36:42.584
salts and kind of scatter them around. They're
doing the best they can from a ceremonial

00:36:42.584 --> 00:36:53.974
standpoint to at least prepare a space. About 15
tense moments pass, as you all look out to the

00:36:53.974 --> 00:37:04.190
horizon, the sun now moving past its zenith and
pushing into the afternoon portion of the day. The

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:09.849
air is growing a little more hot. You find both
the nerves, the stress, and the temperature of the

00:37:09.849 --> 00:37:16.305
room, all the light from the sun being reflected
off the white stone, causing this kind of heated

00:37:16.305 --> 00:37:19.532
element of the interior and you instinctually
begin to sweat and it's getting slightly

00:37:19.532 --> 00:37:27.107
uncomfortable. There is what sounds like a distant
rumble of thunder.

00:37:32.804 --> 00:37:34.700
MARISHA: Where is it coming from?

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:38.136
MATT: You're not sure. It just sort of seemed
directionless.

00:37:38.136 --> 00:37:41.521
TALIESIN: Is anybody else startled by it?

00:37:41.521 --> 00:37:45.760
MATT: You guys all notice each other reacting to
the sound and suddenly it happens again, but this

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.277
time much closer.

00:37:48.645 --> 00:37:50.936
MARISHA: Is this normal? What's happening?

00:37:50.936 --> 00:37:59.499
MATT: Uvenda's looking a bit awkwardly in the--
"Normal? No. But let us be cautious." As she takes

00:37:59.499 --> 00:38:02.632
her staff, her little elderly gnomish form kind of
clutching it

00:38:02.632 --> 00:38:04.592
in front of her in a defensive standpoint.

00:38:04.592 --> 00:38:05.802
TRAVIS: Oh, great.

00:38:05.802 --> 00:38:07.186
LAURA: Don't let anything harm him.

00:38:07.186 --> 00:38:08.292
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:38:08.292 --> 00:38:12.085
TALIESIN: I'm going to run to my room and get my
things. Have we had-- we have not had anything

00:38:12.085 --> 00:38:14.516
vaguely resembling a short rest at this point.

00:38:14.516 --> 00:38:18.837
MATT: No. It all happened very rapidly. The rest
has been the 15 minutes of kind of waiting to hear

00:38:18.837 --> 00:38:24.604
if anything happened. As soon as you start darting
to leave, Percival, that rolling thunder sound

00:38:24.604 --> 00:38:30.437
hits with a small thunder crack. Right in the room
there's a flash of light, there's a spiral burst

00:38:30.437 --> 00:38:35.613
of what looks like a white-orange flame. And there
you see, dropped from about ten feet in the air,

00:38:35.613 --> 00:38:41.664
the golden astral form of Pike with her extended
Sarenrae wings that slowly retract and vanish from

00:38:41.664 --> 00:38:49.318
the form. As your gnomish friend kind of looks up,
her mostly corporeal form. Eyes wide, glancing up

00:38:49.318 --> 00:38:51.236
at the rest of you. Ashley, if you want to come
in.

00:38:51.236 --> 00:39:00.465
(all cheer)

00:39:00.465 --> 00:39:03.145
SAM: As Pike, Ashley Johnson.

00:39:03.849 --> 00:39:10.839
ASHLEY: Hello everybody. I wish it were better
circumstances. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:39:11.099 --> 00:39:16.185
MATT: So Pike, the message came to you and you
immediately went into a frenzy. You were in the

00:39:16.185 --> 00:39:22.468
process of carrying a bunch of food along with
other volunteers within Emon, getting it to some

00:39:22.468 --> 00:39:27.752
of the folks that lost their homes. And when the
voice of Keyleth hit your ears, you immediately

00:39:27.752 --> 00:39:31.600
dropped what you were holding. You found somebody
to help to continue to lead this effort, and

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:36.285
immediately rushed off to find the nearest temple
of Sarenrae in Emon. Which still stands, slightly

00:39:36.285 --> 00:39:41.377
damaged, but it's still one of the buildings of
the temple district that's fine. There, you sat in

00:39:41.377 --> 00:39:46.375
quiet prayer for a number of minutes just
imploring to Sarenrae to offer you some sort of

00:39:46.375 --> 00:39:52.706
guidance or way. And you felt something around you
shift, like a push, someone just kind of pushed

00:39:52.706 --> 00:39:59.456
you in the shoulders. And as your eyes opened, you
weren't in the temple anymore. You were above a

00:39:59.456 --> 00:40:05.605
floor in a brighter, sunlit, unfamiliar place. And
as you land and caught yourself, you can see-- You

00:40:05.605 --> 00:40:11.658
are in your astral form, much like in the
Whitestone experience. And you turn around and

00:40:11.658 --> 00:40:19.061
see, surrounding you in the center of this
open-air chamber in the center of this expansive

00:40:19.061 --> 00:40:27.358
ocean, your friends, their eyes locking to you
with a look of sudden joy and despair mingled.

00:40:29.381 --> 00:40:36.040
MARISHA: Oh, thank Sarenrae. You heard. And I just
run up and-- I was going to give her a hug, and

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:43.497
then pat her astral form. I hug her.

00:40:43.987 --> 00:40:46.261
TRAVIS: Pike, we need your help.

00:40:46.261 --> 00:40:49.068
ASHLEY: Okay. What's happening?

00:40:51.647 --> 00:40:53.945
LAURA: (tearfully) It's Vax.

00:40:54.139 --> 00:40:55.995
MARISHA: Can you still do some sort of
resurrection?

00:40:55.995 --> 00:40:56.963
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:40:56.963 --> 00:40:58.490
MARISHA: From here?

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:03.087
ASHLEY: I think I can. I think I can, I will try.

00:41:04.847 --> 00:41:11.613
MARISHA: How is this going to work with him and
the Raven Queen? What do you know?

00:41:11.613 --> 00:41:13.664
Vex, do you know anything?

00:41:13.664 --> 00:41:16.395
LAURA: I know nothing.

00:41:16.395 --> 00:41:19.353
MARISHA: Do you know anything, Pike?

00:41:20.214 --> 00:41:29.168
ASHLEY: I don't know. I've never done anything
quite like this before. I mean, most of the time

00:41:29.168 --> 00:41:39.319
you guys have been there for resurrections, I
don't know. I don't know. We just have to try.

00:41:40.244 --> 00:41:41.444
MARISHA: Okay.

00:41:41.444 --> 00:41:46.775
TRAVIS: Is there anything on his armor? Like,
something we should be looking for? Like, a tab or

00:41:46.775 --> 00:41:50.240
a button or-- No?

00:41:50.975 --> 00:41:55.349
LAURA: I look. For any sort of message from the
Raven Queen on his armor.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:58.272
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:42:03.133 --> 00:42:04.451
ASHLEY: That's good.

00:42:05.855 --> 00:42:09.537
LAURA: 20. What's five plus seven?

00:42:09.537 --> 00:42:10.836
LIAM: 32.

00:42:10.836 --> 00:42:12.107
LAURA: No! 22.

00:42:12.107 --> 00:42:14.019
LIAM: Oh, I thought you said 25.

00:42:14.019 --> 00:42:15.414
MATT: 22.

00:42:15.414 --> 00:42:16.225
LAURA: 22.

00:42:16.225 --> 00:42:23.444
MATT: I mean, most of the runic symbols and
designs on here aren't formulated in a sentence

00:42:23.444 --> 00:42:29.130
structure or language. You do see the roots of
them. Some of them are Draconic in root, but

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:36.265
they've been changed as part of the enchantment of
the armor. However, you do find a small, crumpled

00:42:36.265 --> 00:42:38.363
note on the inside of the armor.

00:42:39.709 --> 00:42:40.992
LAURA: Can I pull it out?

00:42:40.992 --> 00:42:43.857
MATT: Yeah.

00:42:43.857 --> 00:42:46.104
LAURA: What is it?

00:42:47.048 --> 00:42:48.900
MATT: It's up to you.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.067
LAURA: I'm going to open it.

00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:54.358
MATT: Okay. Do you want to tell her what's on it?

00:42:54.358 --> 00:42:58.928
LIAM: Oh, you want me to tell her? It just says
your name on it.

00:42:58.928 --> 00:43:00.612
LAURA: My-- Fuck.

00:43:00.612 --> 00:43:03.939
LIAM: And it says, "Take these wings and fly."

00:43:03.939 --> 00:43:11.404
LAURA: Oh no. No. I just put it back in the
armor.

00:43:11.404 --> 00:43:13.356
MATT: Okay.

00:43:13.855 --> 00:43:16.791
LAURA: There's nothing.

00:43:21.008 --> 00:43:22.520
TRAVIS: Let's go get him.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.627
MARISHA: Okay.

00:43:23.627 --> 00:43:26.108
LAURA: Can we start? He's been here for a while.
I'm sorry to

00:43:26.108 --> 00:43:29.025
bring you into this so quickly, Pike.

00:43:29.025 --> 00:43:31.939
ASHLEY: No, no, no. It's okay. I would rather be
here, and I'm glad that you guys called me.

00:43:31.939 --> 00:43:33.777
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:43:34.798 --> 00:43:37.876
MATT: Because you're in your astral form, you
don't have the reagents with you. However,

00:43:37.876 --> 00:43:43.401
reagents can be provided by the party. You rummage
through, and you require a diamond of at least 500

00:43:43.401 --> 00:43:47.342
gold piece worth, which you have at your disposal,
so mark that off in the bag of holding.

00:43:47.342 --> 00:43:49.276
LAURA: I'll mark it off.

00:43:50.984 --> 00:43:55.137
MATT: Uvenda has already done a very good job of
preparing the space for a ritual not quite like

00:43:55.137 --> 00:44:01.215
the one you're used to, but a similar variation,
hers being druid-based magic. But you work with

00:44:01.215 --> 00:44:06.822
them over the next hour or so to take elements
they've already prepared and alter it to fit the

00:44:06.822 --> 00:44:14.278
ritual style that you're used to, formulating and
casting. As you finish preparation and your focus,

00:44:14.278 --> 00:44:20.282
clutching onto your holy symbol around your chest,
you feel the warmth of Sarenrae that brought you

00:44:20.282 --> 00:44:26.635
here begin to swell around you. And you guys watch
as the ritual continues, Pike's form begins to

00:44:26.635 --> 00:44:32.473
just emit more and more light. The interior of
this temple, which is largely shaded by the roof

00:44:32.473 --> 00:44:39.234
of the temple, other than the sunlight coming in
from the open walls of it, the whole interior just

00:44:39.234 --> 00:44:47.900
begins to grow brighter from Pike's presence. As
the incantation begins to slowly drift from your

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:54.757
lips and the magic begins to flare, the circle
that was drawn around the body, the three parts of

00:44:54.816 --> 00:45:04.190
it-- The tricorner section of this glyph awaits.
Who wants to bring the first offering to the

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:11.520
ritual? The first attempt to bring.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:26.999
LAURA: I'll do it. I kneel down next to him, and I
take the feathers from behind my ear, and I start

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:38.806
braiding them into his hair, and I say, you were
always better at this than I was, but you gave me

00:45:38.806 --> 00:45:44.997
these feathers in one of my darkest hours to
remind me of the beauty in the world, so I'm

00:45:44.997 --> 00:45:56.705
giving them to you now, because you take the
beauty with you. I've done this so many times.

00:45:56.705 --> 00:46:03.082
We've brought so many of us back, but this feels
different, right? I feel as if I'm not speaking to

00:46:03.144 --> 00:46:05.918
Vax, I feel as though I'm speaking directly to
Her.

00:46:05.918 --> 00:46:08.134
MARISHA: Speak to him.

00:46:08.482 --> 00:46:14.546
LAURA: No. No, he's at her side, but it's being
filtered through the Raven Queen. So these are my

00:46:14.546 --> 00:46:24.801
words to her. I'm here today because of a bargain
my brother made with you, so I know you like to

00:46:24.801 --> 00:46:42.200
make deals as much as I do. He traded his life. He
became your champion, and you spared mine, and

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:52.881
what a striking champion he is. Long dark hair and
a strong lithe figure soaring over the land in

00:46:52.881 --> 00:47:09.148
raven feathers and a dark vestige. He set pyres in
your honor. Sent soul after soul to you. It would

00:47:09.148 --> 00:47:27.252
be a shame to give that up, especially now. And I
remember the book that I read. Especially now as

00:47:27.252 --> 00:47:38.697
Orcus builds his forces against you. The demon
prince of the undead seeks to claim your throne.

00:47:38.697 --> 00:47:46.595
You know this as well as I. We just recently
killed one of his loyal servants in the Underdark,

00:47:46.595 --> 00:47:56.541
before my brother ever came into your service.
Imagine what he could do now. So this is the deal

00:47:56.541 --> 00:48:09.215
I make with you: you send him back, allow my
brother to come home, and we will seek out Orcus.

00:48:09.215 --> 00:48:17.076
I will track him down, I will hunt him in whatever
pit he resides, and we will destroy your enemy

00:48:17.076 --> 00:48:22.962
once and for all. What say you?

00:48:28.051 --> 00:48:29.785
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:48:44.806 --> 00:48:46.712
LAURA: 25.

00:48:46.712 --> 00:48:51.663
MATT: Okay. The minute the words, what say you,
leave your lips, one third of the glyph

00:48:51.663 --> 00:49:01.287
(charging noise) vibrates to life. Where the golden
light of Sarenrae's power that the glyph initially

00:49:01.336 --> 00:49:11.469
emanates, the light, as it brightens, becomes a
purplish-blue hue. So.

00:49:12.626 --> 00:49:14.676
Who wishes to be the next offering?

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:34.371
MARISHA: I'll go. I go up to him, and I prop up
his back and set him up against my chest and

00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:57.738
whisper into his ear and say, I know you can hear
me. I know you're still in there, and I'm sure she

00:49:57.738 --> 00:50:11.537
can hear me too, but your sister is right. You've
held up to your promise, to her, and you've made a

00:50:11.537 --> 00:50:21.648
promise to me. We have to settle down and live
happily together, remember? You promised me.

00:50:21.648 --> 00:50:45.912
Vesrah. So I want to give you a little bit of
light to follow in the darkness. And I find the

00:50:45.912 --> 00:50:57.579
scar on his back of my handprint. And I find it
and I cast Daylight into his back, into the hand

00:50:57.579 --> 00:51:14.982
print and say, and besides... You know I'm in love
with you, right? (quietly) That's it.

00:51:16.845 --> 00:51:19.316
MATT: Roll a d20 and add your wisdom.

00:51:19.623 --> 00:51:33.019
MARISHA: God damn it (sniffles) Which dice? Okay.

00:51:37.272 --> 00:51:38.891
20 total.

00:51:38.938 --> 00:51:40.315
MATT: 20 total.

00:51:40.315 --> 00:51:46.268
MARISHA: Yeah. (whispering) Come on, come on, come
on.

00:51:46.268 --> 00:51:51.280
MATT: As the Daylight spell brightens, your
instinct is to close your eyes, but you push

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:56.532
against it, and you know this will temporarily
burn to your retinas but you still,

00:51:56.532 --> 00:51:57.960
holding that still--

00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.418
MARISHA: I don't care.

00:51:59.418 --> 00:52:02.716
MATT: --whispering into him. You can feel, not
just the tears of your emotion but the instinctual

00:52:02.716 --> 00:52:08.336
pain of the blinding light piercing the inside of
your eyes, but you hold strong as you whisper to

00:52:08.336 --> 00:52:18.444
him and as the final word leaves your lips, the
second portion of the glyph grows alight and then

00:52:18.444 --> 00:52:26.950
transitions to that same purple-blue color. At
which point, the Daylight spell diminishes in a

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:33.034
way that you weren't expecting. As opposed to
being this bright, glowing, blasting beacon, it

00:52:33.034 --> 00:52:41.467
shrinks down to a small condensed gentle glow, and
you're afraid to move your hand.

00:52:41.467 --> 00:52:42.796
MARISHA: And I don't.

00:52:42.796 --> 00:52:46.544
MATT: Okay. There's the last offering.

00:52:49.117 --> 00:52:51.605
SAM: Do you think I should?

00:52:51.605 --> 00:52:52.840
TRAVIS: Shut the fuck up.

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:53.846
SAM: Oh, no?

00:52:53.846 --> 00:52:54.650
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:55.724
(all laugh)

00:52:55.724 --> 00:52:56.822
SAM: All right.

00:52:56.822 --> 00:52:58.178
TALIESIN: You in?

00:52:58.178 --> 00:52:59.435
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:52:59.435 --> 00:53:01.424
TALIESIN: All right.

00:53:02.193 --> 00:53:10.087
TRAVIS: I'll go, then. I go over to Vax. Is he on
a raised platform?

00:53:10.087 --> 00:53:16.007
MATT: No, actually, he's on the ground in a bed of
black feathers and currently is propped up against

00:53:16.007 --> 00:53:20.018
Keyleth's chest. She's sitting behind him so he's
leaning back against her,

00:53:20.018 --> 00:53:22.343
she has her hand against his back.

00:53:22.343 --> 00:53:37.978
TRAVIS: I'll stand over him. I told you before. No
one kills you but me. And I think back to being in

00:53:38.125 --> 00:53:50.383
Percy's workshop at Greyskull Keep and I say, I
love you too. And I reach back

00:53:50.383 --> 00:53:57.661
and I slap the ever-loving fucking shit 
out of his dead face.

00:53:57.661 --> 00:54:00.499
(all laugh)

00:54:01.418 --> 00:54:02.695
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

00:54:02.695 --> 00:54:06.095
(all laugh)

00:54:07.344 --> 00:54:09.094
MATT: Adding your strength.

00:54:09.094 --> 00:54:10.232
LIAM: Oh, jesus.

00:54:10.232 --> 00:54:11.221
TRAVIS: 22.

00:54:11.221 --> 00:54:21.730
MATT: 22, okay. (echoing cracks) Keyleth, it
knocks him out of your grasp,

00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:24.047
the impact is so hard.

00:54:24.047 --> 00:54:27.272
MARISHA: I just keep my hand-- come on, you have
to be that hard?

00:54:27.272 --> 00:54:29.104
MATT: The body just kinda (boof) onto the side--

00:54:29.104 --> 00:54:30.048
LAURA: Oh!

00:54:30.048 --> 00:54:31.064
MATT: --you're like, oh god. You pick him back
up.

00:54:31.064 --> 00:54:32.148
TRAVIS: Love hurts, Keyleth.

00:54:32.148 --> 00:54:33.042
MARISHA: I was-- oh shit.

00:54:33.042 --> 00:54:34.613
SAM: I just let out a (yelps).

00:54:34.613 --> 00:54:38.022
(all laugh)

00:54:38.085 --> 00:54:46.044
MATT: The third and final portion of the circular
glyph alights, and then transitions to that

00:54:46.044 --> 00:54:54.858
purplish-blue glow, the entire circle complete.
Oh, I want another dice.

00:54:55.302 --> 00:54:56.286
LAURA: Oh god, oh god.

00:54:56.286 --> 00:55:00.809
MARISHA: Oh jesus.

00:55:00.928 --> 00:55:02.182
MARISHA: Why is he taking a picture again?

00:55:02.182 --> 00:55:03.195
LAURA: He always does that.

00:55:03.195 --> 00:55:04.949
SAM: He always takes a picture, he always takes a
picture. It's a thing.

00:55:04.949 --> 00:55:20.461
MARISHA: Oh, fucking hell. Oh jesus, come on.

00:55:21.917 --> 00:55:30.767
MATT: The glyphs go dark and so does the light of
the outside. The entire central chamber goes dark,

00:55:30.767 --> 00:55:42.943
the light being crushed and squeezed from the
vicinity. You watch as the air gets cold and a

00:55:42.943 --> 00:55:54.779
slight breeze picks up and in the darkness around
you, surrounding the lifeless body of Vax, all you

00:55:54.779 --> 00:56:04.490
see is your family and darkness and there is a
glowing little thread, a bead, in the sternum of

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:14.256
Vax's lifeless corpse and you watch as a hand
suddenly appears from out of the darkness and

00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:20.876
reaches down and grasps the thread, and emerging
from the darkness, you all see for the first time

00:56:21.024 --> 00:56:31.257
the white, porcelain masked face of the Raven
Queen. As she tugs on the small bead, you watch as

00:56:31.257 --> 00:56:40.307
a bright, white thread begins to be drawn from the
center of his chest and as it does he lifts up

00:56:40.307 --> 00:56:44.962
like a puppet, just limply dangling from it. He's
lifted out of your grasp and Keyleth, you

00:56:44.962 --> 00:56:51.864
instinctually try and reach for him but this
spectacle is-- you find yourself unable to move,

00:56:51.864 --> 00:56:58.422
whether it be by some other power or just the
sheer awe of some sort of a presence here. As he's

00:56:58.422 --> 00:57:09.478
dangled up on this thread, she stops and holds him
there. The mask looks past all of you and without

00:57:09.478 --> 00:57:27.004
the mouth moving a voice fills your minds. "My
champion has learned much and has done great deeds

00:57:27.067 --> 00:57:30.219
"in the service of fate."

00:57:34.016 --> 00:57:42.315
"But there is still much to
be done before my charge is complete in him."

00:57:42.315 --> 00:57:48.688
She releases the thread and he drifts down onto his
feet, arms and head still limp. It slowly

00:57:48.688 --> 00:58:02.525
withdraws into his chest. "We shall meet again.
Come find me when the time is right and I call to

00:58:02.525 --> 00:58:10.076
"you to meet me beyond the divine gate." And as the
mask withdraws into shadow and her form vanishes

00:58:10.076 --> 00:58:16.660
into darkness, suddenly the light comes back in.
You all kinda close your eyes and blink it and the

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:21.915
visions gone and you see all the servants around,
still standing in the places they were just

00:58:21.915 --> 00:58:29.170
looking intently at Vax, their eyes still wide
open and you watch as the limp, standing form

00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:39.580
there before you, the wings of black feathers
slowly stretch out from his shoulders (crackling)

00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:44.121
and as they reach out and stretch and open, his
head pulls back and

00:58:44.121 --> 00:58:51.049
(heavy breath) takes a breath of living air into 
his lungs and his eyes blink open.

00:59:07.997 --> 00:59:09.739
TRAVIS: How do you feel?

00:59:11.958 --> 00:59:23.543
LIAM: Where are we? I just loop my sister's head
and then I loop Keyleth and I just pull them in.

00:59:23.543 --> 00:59:26.503
(gasps) Where are we?

00:59:26.714 --> 00:59:42.675
LAURA: Vesrah. You're alive. (laughs) Hey, that
queen, she's pretty scary looking, huh?

00:59:44.124 --> 00:59:52.928
MARISHA: Yeah, you're not kidding, that's pretty
intense.

00:59:54.777 --> 00:59:56.399
ASHLEY: Hi Vax.

00:59:56.399 --> 00:59:58.662
LIAM: Welcome to my last four months.

00:59:58.662 --> 01:00:00.137
LAURA: (laughs) Hey, Pike.

01:00:00.182 --> 01:00:01.741
ASHLEY: Hi, it's Pickle.

01:00:01.854 --> 01:00:02.856
LAURA: Pike's here.

01:00:02.916 --> 01:00:04.255
(shaky laughter)

01:00:04.317 --> 01:00:05.550
LIAM: Pike.

01:00:05.550 --> 01:00:06.528
MARISHA: She did it again.

01:00:06.528 --> 01:00:07.608
LAURA: She fixed you.

01:00:07.608 --> 01:00:09.304
ASHLEY: No, I didn't.

01:00:09.563 --> 01:00:11.713
LIAM: Can I feel you?

01:00:13.214 --> 01:00:22.497
MATT: There is some physicality to her divine
form. Pike feels like she's there, like she can be

01:00:22.497 --> 01:00:29.778
held and touched, but it's like touching a warm,
soft Jello.

01:00:30.531 --> 01:00:35.354
ASHLEY: I go and I give him a big 'ol hug. A
Jello-y hug. Gloop!

01:00:35.752 --> 01:00:41.177
MATT: Or like a big piece of cotton. It's softer
and gives a bit.

01:00:41.389 --> 01:00:42.784
MARISHA: Cotton candy Pike.

01:00:42.784 --> 01:00:44.206
MATT: Kinda, yeah. Kinda.

01:00:44.206 --> 01:00:54.099
LIAM: I take hold of the Jello head and press my
head into it and say, thank you, sister.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.059
ASHLEY: Of course, Vax.

01:00:57.059 --> 01:00:58.279
LIAM: Thank you.

01:00:58.279 --> 01:01:02.893
ASHLEY: I give him a cotton candy kiss on his
forehead.

01:01:02.955 --> 01:01:04.734
TRAVIS: Aw, man.

01:01:04.734 --> 01:01:09.459
MATT: As she does so, and she releases your head,
Vax, you look at her face and you look up and just

01:01:09.459 --> 01:01:16.399
behind her, you see the mask there, and the voice
comes to your head. None of you see this, just

01:01:16.399 --> 01:01:27.202
Vax. And says, "Soon. I'll call for your purpose.
In time." And it just fades and you can now see

01:01:27.202 --> 01:01:30.964
the sea beyond the midday of Vesrah now
surrounding you.

01:01:36.048 --> 01:01:38.154
LIAM: Whoa. Hey, I feel like shit.

01:01:38.154 --> 01:01:39.801
LAURA: Hey welcome to the club.

01:01:39.801 --> 01:01:41.325
TRAVIS: Yeah, you punched your card.

01:01:41.325 --> 01:01:42.696
LAURA: Yeah, all that's left now is Keyleth.

01:01:42.696 --> 01:01:47.100
MATT: Which, by the way, your jaw is sore and
you're pretty sure you're missing a tooth.

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:49.136
LAURA: Oh!

01:01:50.559 --> 01:01:52.434
TRAVIS: Can't grow that back, bitch.

01:01:52.434 --> 01:01:56.137
MATT: Okay, yeah.

01:01:56.137 --> 01:02:05.298
LIAM: (spits) I walk over to Grog, and I try to
reach my arms around him and fail.

01:02:05.298 --> 01:02:08.502
You fucking fucker, come here.

01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:11.317
TRAVIS: Yeah, welcome back. Don't be weird.

01:02:11.317 --> 01:02:14.747
LIAM: Ah, you've met me, right?

01:02:14.747 --> 01:02:15.744
TRAVIS: That's true.

01:02:15.744 --> 01:02:16.938
LIAM: Yeah.

01:02:24.135 --> 01:02:32.423
MARISHA: Glad you're not dead. Really glad you're
not dead.

01:02:33.102 --> 01:02:35.568
LIAM: Me too.

01:02:35.830 --> 01:02:39.342
LAURA: Do you need to rest? Do you need to go lay
down?

01:02:39.342 --> 01:02:40.371
LIAM: Don't we all?

01:02:40.371 --> 01:02:41.787
MARISHA: I feel like we all need to rest.

01:02:41.787 --> 01:02:42.487
LAURA: Well yes, but--

01:02:42.487 --> 01:02:44.026
TRAVIS: I'm good.

01:02:44.026 --> 01:02:45.476
MARISHA: I turn to Uvenda.

01:02:45.476 --> 01:02:49.831
MATT: Okay. She's still kind of like, "Well. I'm
glad to see that this was a success. That your

01:02:49.831 --> 01:02:52.321
"friend could come in aid as well."

01:02:54.275 --> 01:02:56.412
MARISHA: Grog. Tary.

01:02:56.644 --> 01:02:57.491
SAM: Yes?

01:02:57.491 --> 01:02:58.741
MARISHA: The lodestones.

01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:01.326
LAURA: Oh. I pull mine out as well.

01:03:01.679 --> 01:03:10.827
SAM: Oh. Oh, yes. I hereby present to you a
lodestone that I got at the bottom of the sea.

01:03:11.772 --> 01:03:14.003
MARISHA: Yeah. Good job, good job. Good work.

01:03:14.421 --> 01:03:16.672
MATT: She kind of points over and the servants
come up and collect the three of them and she

01:03:16.672 --> 01:03:26.467
goes, "Well, this is fine news. I was worried that
we had a loss, and perhaps this endeavor was

01:03:26.467 --> 01:03:38.698
"incomplete. However, it appears that you've both
survived the encounter with the current scourge to

01:03:38.698 --> 01:03:50.006
"Vesrah's rift, and you've completed your
Aramente, young Keyleth. There will be a

01:03:50.081 --> 01:03:53.283
"celebration tonight before we send you back to
Zephra,

01:03:53.283 --> 01:03:58.054
"where you will be formally crowned by your 
father, Korren."

01:04:00.041 --> 01:04:04.761
MARISHA: Oh, that's happening tonight? Oh wow,
this stuff moves fast, yeah

01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:14.408
MATT: "We'll celebrate this evening. You'll return
at your leisure, but--" And she kind of walks up

01:04:14.408 --> 01:04:23.355
to you, and she can see the tears, and she kind of
reaches up with her wrinkled, sun-wrecked, elderly

01:04:23.355 --> 01:04:31.822
gnome skin. And reaches up and rubs the tears from
your face and goes, "It's all right. You've done

01:04:31.822 --> 01:04:35.412
"well. And I'm sorry."

01:04:37.332 --> 01:04:38.912
MARISHA: For what?

01:04:40.494 --> 01:04:52.770
MATT: "For a lot of things. The Aramente didn't
used to be this dangerous. It's tradition, but our

01:04:52.770 --> 01:05:06.120
"trial has changed, and while we grew confident in
your confidence upon arrival, we should've been

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:10.263
"more attentive. This might not have happened."

01:05:13.036 --> 01:05:20.139
MARISHA: No. It was my negligence in proper
planning that added to this.

01:05:20.862 --> 01:05:25.184
MATT: "That may be the lesson learned at this
trial. But I think we have learned a lesson as

01:05:25.184 --> 01:05:32.939
"well. And perhaps we need to adjust our trial,
given the dangers

01:05:32.939 --> 01:05:37.579
"of our recent elemental guardian."

01:05:38.321 --> 01:05:43.311
MARISHA: I think the landscape of the world has
changed a lot recently, and I think the Aramente

01:05:43.311 --> 01:05:50.398
should reflect that. So I would be honored to
provide any insight to help.

01:05:53.299 --> 01:05:59.860
MATT: "Well, come back. Come back once you've
returned to your people and become the Voice of

01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:13.783
"the Tempest. Then we may alter however you see
fit. Anyway, glad you're awake!"

01:06:13.783 --> 01:06:15.447
Taps you on the head with the staff.

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:17.660
TRAVIS: Unconscious.

01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:18.686
(all laugh)

01:06:18.686 --> 01:06:19.813
MATT: "Shit!"

01:06:21.082 --> 01:06:24.833
LAURA: How many people lose their lives on their
Aramente? How many people complete it?

01:06:26.588 --> 01:06:32.987
MATT: "Well, the Aramente is generally not a
lethal experience. The kraken only arrived this

01:06:32.987 --> 01:06:41.192
"recent generation, and honestly, the only two
who's had to take it with the kraken's presence

01:06:41.192 --> 01:06:43.727
"were Keyleth and her mother."

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:46.246
MARISHA: What?

01:06:48.919 --> 01:06:51.877
TALIESIN: I'd been hoping to run a perception
check through pretty much this entire

01:06:51.877 --> 01:06:55.501
conversation, to make sure she's being completely
honest about everything.

01:06:55.501 --> 01:06:56.796
MATT: Insight check, you mean?

01:06:56.796 --> 01:07:03.063
TALIESIN: Yeah, an insight check. Meh, 13.

01:07:03.063 --> 01:07:05.142
MATT: 13. Hard to read.

01:07:05.142 --> 01:07:06.002
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:07:06.002 --> 01:07:08.730
MATT: She seems to be upfront.

01:07:09.415 --> 01:07:16.438
MARISHA: What do you mean? Why were we the only
ones with the tools?

01:07:17.288 --> 01:07:22.432
MATT: "Well, before the kraken came to the rift,
it was simply an excursion to gather the

01:07:22.432 --> 01:07:30.340
"lodestones amongst errant elementals and other
mild dangers within the plane. The kraken had only

01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:31.765
"been drawn to the rift--"

01:07:32.321 --> 01:07:33.389
MARISHA: Recently.

01:07:33.389 --> 01:07:38.560
MATT: "-- recently. And unfortunately, Vilya was
the first to take the trial

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:44.063
"with it residing just beyond our door."

01:07:44.063 --> 01:07:46.533
LAURA: How many people did she have with her?

01:07:46.533 --> 01:07:48.639
MATT: "She went in with five."

01:07:48.639 --> 01:07:51.079
MARISHA: And none returned?

01:07:51.079 --> 01:07:56.170
MATT: "None. Two of which were our own."

01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:58.098
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

01:07:58.098 --> 01:08:06.664
MATT: "That's the danger we face in these times.
To exist among such ravaging elemental forces is

01:08:06.664 --> 01:08:14.678
"a danger unto itself. But that is the call of the
Ashari by nature, is it not?"

01:08:14.739 --> 01:08:16.498
MARISHA: Yes, it is.

01:08:16.498 --> 01:08:25.349
MATT: "To safeguard the rest of civilization from
these terrors. Anyway, enough dourness. It got

01:08:25.349 --> 01:08:30.826
"rather cold here and I think we could use some
warming heat of the sun, some food and perhaps

01:08:30.826 --> 01:08:32.908
"some rest for you." Hits you again on the
forehead.

01:08:34.797 --> 01:08:36.711
LIAM: I'm alive.

01:08:37.206 --> 01:08:42.930
MARISHA: Do you mind if we take a brief respite
amongst ourselves, before we catch up with you and

01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:45.422
join in the festivities?

01:08:45.422 --> 01:08:51.386
MATT: "But of course! It's--" And she looks at the
sun. "It's about time for my sailing, so I'll see

01:08:51.386 --> 01:08:56.458
"you here in the next hour or two." And she goes,
and two of her servants start

01:08:56.458 --> 01:08:59.616
flanking her down the stairway.

01:08:59.951 --> 01:09:01.987
MARISHA: Kaitiaki, Uvenda.

01:09:01.987 --> 01:09:12.199
MATT: She stops and turns, looking back at all of
you, and gives a deep bow. "Kaitiaki." Continues

01:09:12.199 --> 01:09:14.168
to make her way down the stairs.

01:09:17.711 --> 01:09:18.886
ASHLEY: Keyleth.

01:09:18.886 --> 01:09:22.151
MARISHA: Group hug, guys, group hug!

01:09:22.151 --> 01:09:23.958
TRAVIS: You did it.

01:09:23.958 --> 01:09:25.408
MARISHA: Come here, Tary, you too.

01:09:25.408 --> 01:09:31.738
SAM: Oh, me too? All right, okay. Sure, sure. This
is natural, this is right.

01:09:31.738 --> 01:09:33.438
LIAM: Who is that?

01:09:33.438 --> 01:09:34.957
LAURA: What are you talking about, 'who is that'?

01:09:34.957 --> 01:09:37.471
LIAM: That guy, who is that guy?

01:09:37.471 --> 01:09:39.884
LAURA: What are you talking about, that is Taryon.

01:09:39.884 --> 01:09:46.437
SAM: Oh, come now. You recognize me. Taryon
Darrington! The brave, the bold. We both fell in

01:09:46.437 --> 01:09:48.860
battle, so I know exactly how you feel right now.

01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:50.899
LIAM: Oh, I've read your book!

01:09:50.899 --> 01:09:51.601
SAM: Well.

01:09:51.601 --> 01:09:53.090
LIAM: I know you.

01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:54.555
LAURA: I didn't think it was published yet.

01:09:54.555 --> 01:09:59.587
SAM: Not quite yet, but I'm sure people are
already talking about it.

01:09:59.587 --> 01:10:01.319
LIAM: How did you do, Tary?

01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:02.999
SAM: Well--

01:10:02.999 --> 01:10:04.421
TRAVIS: Yeah, how did you do, Tary?

01:10:04.421 --> 01:10:05.676
TALIESIN: Well, he did well.

01:10:05.676 --> 01:10:06.789
SAM: Doty, take this down.

01:10:06.789 --> 01:10:10.107
MATT: Which, as you look over, Doty has been faced
away from the entire ritual and had been recording

01:10:10.107 --> 01:10:15.425
the various weather elements and surroundings.

01:10:15.425 --> 01:10:21.261
SAM: Doty, no! We just witnessed an amazing
ritual. Did you not get any of that?

01:10:21.261 --> 01:10:25.100
MATT: Turns the book around and you can see it
talks about cloud structures, it talks about a few

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:29.689
children that were playing in the water below.

01:10:29.689 --> 01:10:39.413
SAM: Well, you are consistent. I'll fill you in on
the details of that later, but now take this down.

01:10:39.413 --> 01:10:48.717
'Plagued by an incompetent plan and ambushed by a
surprise from a kraken, we nevertheless stayed

01:10:48.778 --> 01:10:57.192
'true to ourselves and to our bravery, found the
lodestones and, despite nearly dying, came back to

01:10:57.192 --> 01:11:04.343
'tell the tale, proving ourselves as heroes of
Vesrah and to each other. I was aided by young

01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:12.350
'Percival in my fight. Abandoned by the Antlers and
the Elves. And by the end of the fight, it was

01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:19.385
'just me and the big guy, duking it out. I blacked
out for a moment, but before I did, I'm sure he

01:11:19.385 --> 01:11:26.384
'saw my bravery and was impressed. That's why he
dragged me to safety and presented me to Percival

01:11:26.384 --> 01:11:29.080
'for healing.' That's enough for now.

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:32.486
LAURA: You forgot to mention the part where you
vomited and blew our cover.

01:11:32.486 --> 01:11:34.140
MARISHA: Oh, that's right, you did do that.

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:35.052
LAURA: Thank you.

01:11:35.052 --> 01:11:40.240
SAM: It's not-- This is the abridged-- I don't
want to bore the readers with too much detail.

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:45.563
TRAVIS: It's so weird. I totally remember walking
past you and trying to leave.

01:11:45.563 --> 01:11:51.880
SAM: Somehow, I got to the rift door and I didn't
get there on my own, so thank you. Thank you, Big

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:55.239
Guy, for dragging me there. I appreciate it.

01:11:55.902 --> 01:11:57.959
LAURA: Um, Pike.

01:11:57.959 --> 01:11:59.078
SAM: Oh!

01:11:59.078 --> 01:12:05.755
ASHLEY: Have I met-- I don't know-- My memory is
not-- Who are you?

01:12:05.755 --> 01:12:10.622
SAM: Taryon Darrington. We passed briefly in
Whitestone.

01:12:10.622 --> 01:12:11.957
MATT: Briefly, yes.

01:12:11.957 --> 01:12:20.999
ASHLEY: Yes, I didn't realize you were still with
my family.

01:12:20.999 --> 01:12:23.790
SAM: I'll switch to Gnome.

01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:24.977
ASHLEY: Oh, it's fine, I can--

01:12:24.977 --> 01:12:28.903
SAM: And I'll say, oh, you're friendly with these
people as well?

01:12:28.903 --> 01:12:30.132
ASHLEY: Ah, yes.

01:12:30.132 --> 01:12:35.163
SAM: They've taken me in and they're showing me
the ropes of adventure, and we've already done

01:12:35.163 --> 01:12:38.785
quite a lot. We were on a boat that was attacked.

01:12:38.785 --> 01:12:40.153
ASHLEY: Oh wow.

01:12:40.153 --> 01:12:45.804
SAM: And we almost died, but I destroyed the beast
that was attacking us with a bit of magic.

01:12:45.804 --> 01:12:48.118
ASHLEY: How did you destroy it? Do tell me.

01:12:48.118 --> 01:12:54.667
SAM: I have a lot of tricks. Magical things that I
think you might even understand, because it seems

01:12:54.667 --> 01:12:57.929
that you are a magic user yourself.

01:12:57.929 --> 01:13:01.148
ASHLEY: I dabble.

01:13:01.148 --> 01:13:05.907
SAM: The resurrection thing that you just did was
amazing. I've never seen anything like it, and it

01:13:05.907 --> 01:13:12.910
was quite astounding for somehow who's not really
here. Hello?

01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:15.565
MATT: Your hand (impact sounds) does actually hit
the side of her face.

01:13:15.565 --> 01:13:17.462
SAM: Oh! Sorry, sorry.

01:13:17.462 --> 01:13:19.058
LAURA: And they're speaking this whole time in
Gnome?

01:13:19.058 --> 01:13:22.516
MATT: Yeah. This whole time, you've been hearing
(talks Gnome).

01:13:22.516 --> 01:13:29.843
SAM: By the way, how is my accent? I haven't had a
chance to practice Gnome on an actual gnome in a

01:13:29.843 --> 01:13:32.203
long, long time, since I was a boy.

01:13:32.203 --> 01:13:33.205
ASHLEY: It's terrible.

01:13:33.205 --> 01:13:34.199
SAM: Oh.

01:13:34.199 --> 01:13:37.842
ASHLEY: But it's nice to be able to speak it.

01:13:37.842 --> 01:13:44.049
SAM: I apologize profusely for butchering your
language. I learned it by books, and, as I've

01:13:44.049 --> 01:13:50.088
said, I've only had a chance to speak it once
before to a gnome who visited

01:13:50.088 --> 01:13:53.715
my family's estate a long time ago.

01:13:53.715 --> 01:13:59.341
ASHLEY: Oh? All gnomes know each other, so who was
it?

01:14:00.572 --> 01:14:03.467
SAM: I didn't catch the fellow's name.

01:14:04.427 --> 01:14:06.483
ASHLEY: It was a fellow, that narrows it down.

01:14:06.483 --> 01:14:14.089
SAM: He was part of a performing troupe that my
father hired to entertain us on New Year's Eve.

01:14:14.089 --> 01:14:22.394
And they came in, stayed a few days. I remember
quite vividly though that they left in a hurry.

01:14:22.394 --> 01:14:29.408
Something went on with one of the members of the
troupe and my father's handmaiden, and he was very

01:14:29.408 --> 01:14:34.474
upset with it and he chased them all off in the
morning. I didn't get to continue practicing with

01:14:34.474 --> 01:14:40.286
him. All I know is, my father was so upset.
Something happened in his room, he had to burn his

01:14:40.286 --> 01:14:49.371
bedsheets, and I think he got a new bed. I don't
know quite what happened, but it was quite a

01:14:49.371 --> 01:14:54.351
dramatic thing. I was only about 12 or 13 at the
time.

01:14:54.351 --> 01:15:03.100
ASHLEY: That sounds like somebody that I would
love tremendously.

01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:10.005
SAM: Well, he had a sharp wit to him, and-- not
very attractive young man, but--

01:15:10.005 --> 01:15:13.956
ASHLEY: He sounds very familiar. Like I said, us
gnomes do know each other.

01:15:13.956 --> 01:15:15.093
SAM: That's amazing.

01:15:15.093 --> 01:15:16.025
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:15:16.025 --> 01:15:19.599
SAM: Really? And is it true that you live hundreds
of years, and--

01:15:19.599 --> 01:15:21.550
ASHLEY: Thousands, even.

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:22.660
SAM: Is-- Oh! I--

01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:23.745
ASHLEY: Thousands.

01:15:23.745 --> 01:15:24.899
SAM: I was misinformed.

01:15:24.899 --> 01:15:27.099
ASHLEY: It's something you should know. Yes, I
should-- if you need to know anything, you should

01:15:27.099 --> 01:15:28.059
always ask me.

01:15:28.059 --> 01:15:28.899
SAM: I will. I--

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:30.675
ASHLEY: I will tell you all the truths.

01:15:30.675 --> 01:15:35.637
SAM: I will-- I was planning on doing at least one
chapter in my book about the smaller races, and

01:15:35.637 --> 01:15:37.492
that would be an excellent--

01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:38.653
MARISHA: Oh boy.

01:15:38.653 --> 01:15:40.624
SAM: -- an excellent fitting, uh, addendum.

01:15:40.624 --> 01:15:43.246
ASHLEY: (laughs) Well.

01:15:43.246 --> 01:15:45.910
TALIESIN: Yeah. Yeah.

01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:47.729
ASHLEY: You are just delightful.

01:15:47.803 --> 01:15:50.061
(all laugh)

01:15:50.061 --> 01:15:54.485
SAM: Well you-- you are, too. Pleasure to meet--
make your acquaintance.

01:15:54.485 --> 01:15:56.850
ASHLEY: (laughs) Okay.

01:15:57.178 --> 01:15:59.864
TRAVIS: You can feel free to smoke this fool, it's
fine.

01:15:59.864 --> 01:16:01.837
ASHLEY: No, that's fine. He's a little bit of a
twat, isn't he?

01:16:01.837 --> 01:16:04.045
TRAVIS: A little bit.

01:16:04.045 --> 01:16:08.252
ASHLEY: I don't mind him, though. All right.

01:16:08.252 --> 01:16:19.239
MATT: All right. So. As you guys take a little bit
of time to go ahead and rest, recover, converse,

01:16:19.384 --> 01:16:21.722
and bask in--

01:16:21.722 --> 01:16:23.062
MARISHA: Heal up a bit?

01:16:23.062 --> 01:16:28.139
MATT: Heal up a bit, take a short rest, use your
hit dice, get your abilities back that do come

01:16:28.139 --> 01:16:35.080
back from a short rest, we're gonna go ahead and
take a quick break. Be back here in a few minutes.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.365
Hold onto that back-up character!

01:16:37.365 --> 01:16:38.222
SAM: Oh!

01:16:38.222 --> 01:16:39.123
MATT: 'Til later.

01:16:39.123 --> 01:16:40.407
LAURA: Oh, until later, okay, okay.

01:16:40.407 --> 01:16:41.299
MARISHA: In case.

01:16:41.299 --> 01:16:43.993
LIAM: I'm 98% relieved and 2% bummed that I--

01:16:43.993 --> 01:16:44.791
MATT: I know!

01:16:44.791 --> 01:16:46.233
TALIESIN: No, I know the feeling, man.

01:16:46.233 --> 01:16:47.973
MATT: I know. Who knows, it may still come up.

01:16:47.973 --> 01:16:48.601
LIAM: Yeah.

01:16:48.601 --> 01:16:50.035
MATT: (laughs)

01:16:50.035 --> 01:16:52.438
TRAVIS: What does that mean?! We don't know what
that means! You can't say that shit!

01:16:52.438 --> 01:16:53.418
MATT: What?

01:16:53.418 --> 01:16:56.218
LIAM: Raven Queen. Just kidding! (weird caw
noise)

01:16:56.218 --> 01:16:58.548
TRAVIS: Raven King! Wooloolooloo!

01:16:58.548 --> 01:17:01.967
MATT: It's almost like future challenges in the
story might involve more death, I don't know.

01:17:01.967 --> 01:17:02.756
LAURA: Uh-huh.

01:17:02.756 --> 01:17:04.350
ASHLEY: I'm eating my feelings.

01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:07.165
(all laugh)

01:17:07.165 --> 01:17:08.915
MATT: Yeah, a little disappointed, but this works
well.

01:17:08.915 --> 01:17:10.304
LAURA: So we'll heal up now.

01:17:10.304 --> 01:17:14.180
MATT: Yeah, heal up now, we're gonna take a break,
we'll be here in a few minutes, guys. Much love.

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:17.309
We have another giveaway from our friends at
Wyrmwood tonight! I don't know what we're giving

01:17:17.309 --> 01:17:18.909
away, 'cause I was to give--

01:17:18.909 --> 01:17:20.360
CREW: Dice tower. Dice tower!

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:27.850
MATT: A dice tower! Oh, snap. You guys are getting
a full-scale dice tower. What is it? It is wood.

01:17:27.850 --> 01:17:29.973
It is made of wood and it is a dice tower.

01:17:29.973 --> 01:17:31.303
CREW: We're running it up to you!

01:17:31.303 --> 01:17:35.985
MATT: And it's gonna be free to the winner! So,
come on over to the Twitch chat, and get involved

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:40.019
over the break. The word is raven, R-A-V-E-N.

01:17:40.019 --> 01:17:41.233
TRAVIS: 69 hit points.

01:17:41.233 --> 01:17:47.032
MATT: Go ahead and-- Yeah you are, Grog. Oh. Oh
snap! That is not a dice tower--

01:17:47.032 --> 01:17:48.269
CREW: Not a dice tower.

01:17:48.269 --> 01:17:49.601
MATT: -- it's a deck box.

01:17:49.601 --> 01:17:50.607
CREW: Sentinel box.

01:17:50.607 --> 01:17:56.983
MATT: Sentinel box! Which is still rad. They told
me it was a-- but however-- oh, that's cool! It

01:17:56.983 --> 01:18:01.230
has like a small magnetic-- must be for minis
and-- or dice, if you want to. So that's pretty

01:18:01.230 --> 01:18:05.720
rad, actually. So anyway, this 'Bird's Eye Maple
Sentinel Deck Box' is gonna go

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.183
to whoever the winner is.

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:08.284
TRAVIS: Oh, that's pretty.

01:18:08.284 --> 01:18:10.946
MATT: Type 'Raven' into the chat room of Twitch to
win. We'll have an announcement when we come back.

01:18:10.946 --> 01:18:12.512
See you guys in a few minutes.

01:18:12.512 --> 01:18:14.137
(all cheer)

01:18:14.137 --> 01:36:04.906
[break]

01:36:04.976 --> 01:36:06.755
MATT: Welcome back, everyone, to Critical Role.

01:36:06.755 --> 01:36:08.204
(background laughter)

01:36:08.204 --> 01:36:16.207
MATT: Damn it. First and foremost, I wanna mention
that our fantastic fundly to Amandine is

01:36:16.207 --> 01:36:18.193
apparently already really close to its goal!

01:36:18.193 --> 01:36:20.789
(cheers)

01:36:20.789 --> 01:36:31.065
MATT: So if you guys want to check it out, it's
fundly.com/we-love-amandine A-M-A-N-D-I-N-E. If

01:36:31.065 --> 01:36:33.407
you can give anything, we're almost at the goal,
which is awesome.

01:36:33.407 --> 01:36:34.457
TRAVIS: That's amazing.

01:36:34.457 --> 01:36:35.418
MATT: Also, we have the winner in chat!

01:36:35.418 --> 01:36:36.582
SAM: (loud burp)

01:36:36.582 --> 01:36:37.501
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

01:36:37.501 --> 01:36:38.236
TALIESIN: Whoa.

01:36:38.236 --> 01:36:39.162
SAM: Sorry. Still reeling.

01:36:39.162 --> 01:36:40.085
TALIESIN: How you feeling, buddy?

01:36:40.085 --> 01:36:41.518
SAM: Still reeling.

01:36:41.518 --> 01:36:48.212
MATT: We have the winner in chat of our fantastic
deck box from our friends at Wyrmwood, it is

01:36:48.369 --> 01:36:52.082
@stevetharia! @stevetharia, you are the winner,
we're gonna go ahead and sign that box and get it

01:36:52.082 --> 01:36:56.816
sent to you, that Sentinel box. Congratulations.
We'll have more giveaways in future episodes, so

01:36:56.816 --> 01:37:02.106
if you didn't get it tonight, come back again, and
have another chance, which is awesome! All right.

01:37:02.106 --> 01:37:11.960
So. Bringing us back in. You guys have had some
time to recover, gather your thoughts, gather your

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:22.248
wits, and reflect on the recent near-permanent
loss of your Champion of the Raven Queen,

01:37:22.248 --> 01:37:29.057
Vax'ildan. You now currently sit wherever you'd
like within the city of Vesrah in preparation for

01:37:29.057 --> 01:37:34.684
an evening celebration. Is there anything you guys
wish to do in the meantime?

01:37:34.684 --> 01:37:39.264
LIAM: How much time has passed since I got brought
back up there?

01:37:39.264 --> 01:37:39.918
MATT: About an hour.

01:37:39.918 --> 01:37:40.592
LIAM: About an hour?

01:37:40.592 --> 01:37:41.242
MATT: Yeah.

01:37:41.242 --> 01:37:42.001
LIAM: A little over an hour?

01:37:42.001 --> 01:37:42.846
MATT: A little over an hour, I'd say.

01:37:42.846 --> 01:37:43.803
LIAM: A little over an hour?

01:37:43.803 --> 01:37:44.881
MATT: Just from resting, yeah.

01:37:44.881 --> 01:37:47.631
LIAM: Just out of curiosity, do my wings 'shloop'
back in?

01:37:47.631 --> 01:37:48.717
MATT: Yes, they have retracted.

01:37:48.717 --> 01:37:50.058
LIAM: They did.

01:37:50.058 --> 01:37:51.729
TALIESIN: Where is everybody?

01:37:51.729 --> 01:37:52.806
MARISHA: Yeah, are we all together?

01:37:52.806 --> 01:37:54.455
MATT: You guys are all together, if you wanna be,
yeah.

01:37:54.455 --> 01:37:55.781
LAURA: Can we be on the beach?

01:37:55.781 --> 01:37:56.579
MARISHA: Ooh, yeah.

01:37:56.579 --> 01:37:57.259
MATT: Sure!

01:37:57.259 --> 01:37:57.919
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:37:57.919 --> 01:37:58.867
SAM: Is there a beach?

01:37:58.867 --> 01:38:02.920
MATT: Well, there are portions where the sand kind
of breaks the surface-- a lot of it is, you know,

01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:06.167
maybe a foot, foot and a half, below the water
before you start hitting the reef and the, you

01:38:06.167 --> 01:38:11.334
know, the beach shelf drop off, but there are
places where the sand rises above, and there are

01:38:11.334 --> 01:38:17.150
patches where you see a lot of the kids kind of
play around and leap off of, and there are beach

01:38:17.150 --> 01:38:23.162
elements closer to the islands on the outskirts of
the city, between the actual islands themselves.

01:38:23.162 --> 01:38:25.247
So yeah, there are beaches.

01:38:25.247 --> 01:38:29.898
TALIESIN: I'm going to be crafting little seashell
necklaces or hair bits for everybody-- I've been

01:38:29.898 --> 01:38:32.324
working on a hair bit.

01:38:32.324 --> 01:38:33.398
LAURA: I like it.

01:38:33.398 --> 01:38:34.569
TALIESIN: Mm. Little--

01:38:34.569 --> 01:38:37.803
LAURA: Like a hair bit, or like a hair bit that
goes like this?

01:38:37.803 --> 01:38:38.625
ASHLEY: Ooh.

01:38:38.625 --> 01:38:39.456
TALIESIN: Yeah, and like the--

01:38:39.456 --> 01:38:40.207
MARISHA: Oh, yeah yeah, yeah!

01:38:40.207 --> 01:38:41.050
TALIESIN: -- with the little, yeah.

01:38:41.050 --> 01:38:41.988
LAURA: Ooh! Yeah!

01:38:41.988 --> 01:38:43.064
MARISHA: With a-- mm.

01:38:43.064 --> 01:38:43.951
TALIESIN: You know what it-- yeah--

01:38:43.951 --> 01:38:44.757
LAURA: I like it.

01:38:44.757 --> 01:38:45.624
MATT: Yeah.

01:38:45.624 --> 01:38:46.525
TALIESIN: It's like we've had this conversation.

01:38:46.525 --> 01:38:47.618
LAURA: (laughs)

01:38:47.618 --> 01:38:48.915
TALIESIN: Making little bits for everybody.

01:38:48.915 --> 01:38:51.549
MATT: There you go. As you're working on that,
Vax, you do notice in this time that you see one

01:38:51.549 --> 01:38:54.755
of your sister's feathers that's kind of carefully
braided into your hair.

01:38:54.755 --> 01:38:57.530
LAURA: All of. I've only got two of 'em and
they're both in his hair.

01:38:57.530 --> 01:39:02.309
MATT: There you go. Both of your sister's feathers
are braided into your hair.

01:39:04.664 --> 01:39:09.542
MARISHA: I have something for you all. I have
presents.

01:39:09.542 --> 01:39:11.616
TRAVIS: Presents?

01:39:11.616 --> 01:39:12.777
MARISHA: Mm-hm.

01:39:12.777 --> 01:39:14.159
LAURA: What for?

01:39:14.159 --> 01:39:22.024
MARISHA: Well, I had Gilmore help me out with a
little something for if and when I completed the

01:39:22.024 --> 01:39:30.785
Aramente, as a thank you, so I got them from him
before we left-- granted, in hindsight, I'm never

01:39:30.785 --> 01:39:37.960
holding onto presents ever again, 'cause we could
all just die any day. But!

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:38.927
LIAM: Like we do.

01:39:38.927 --> 01:39:39.667
MARISHA: At least--

01:39:39.667 --> 01:39:41.156
LAURA: Like you do.

01:39:41.156 --> 01:39:50.355
MARISHA: Yeah, like you do. But this time it
worked out okay. And I pull out all the necklaces.

01:39:50.663 --> 01:39:57.822
These are from the dragons we've collected.
They're dragon-tooth necklaces.

01:39:57.822 --> 01:39:59.218
ALL: Ooh!

01:39:59.218 --> 01:40:07.295
MARISHA: And I had Gilmore enchant a very simple
enchantment to each of them, so it won't-- you

01:40:07.295 --> 01:40:09.526
won't have to focus or attune to it--

01:40:09.526 --> 01:40:10.754
LAURA: Oh!

01:40:10.754 --> 01:40:13.867
MARISHA: -- if any one of us goes unconscience--
unconscious.

01:40:13.867 --> 01:40:15.286
LIAM: We're with you.

01:40:15.286 --> 01:40:17.228
MARISHA: If any one of us goes unconscious--

01:40:17.228 --> 01:40:18.357
LIAM: Don't sweat the details.

01:40:18.357 --> 01:40:26.453
MARISHA: Thank you. The rest of them will start
beating a little heartbeat. That way, we know if

01:40:26.453 --> 01:40:33.104
any one of us goes down, even if we can't see each
other. So. Grog!

01:40:33.104 --> 01:40:34.530
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:40:34.530 --> 01:40:35.533
MARISHA: Pike!

01:40:35.533 --> 01:40:36.786
ASHLEY: Thanks!

01:40:36.786 --> 01:40:37.699
MARISHA: And Vex!

01:40:37.699 --> 01:40:40.243
LAURA: It's wonderful, it's a little morbid and
wonderful at the same time.

01:40:40.243 --> 01:40:41.202
ASHLEY: I love it.

01:40:41.202 --> 01:40:42.048
MARISHA: Yeah. I know--

01:40:42.048 --> 01:40:43.447
LIAM: Nah, it's fucking badass.

01:40:43.447 --> 01:40:44.411
LAURA: That's so wonderful, Keyleth.

01:40:44.411 --> 01:40:45.452
TRAVIS: It's nails.

01:40:45.452 --> 01:40:47.231
MARISHA: Figure we all go unconscious so often--

01:40:47.231 --> 01:40:48.194
LAURA: That's so thoughtful.

01:40:48.194 --> 01:40:52.207
TRAVIS: Well, most of us do.

01:40:52.207 --> 01:40:53.262
ASHLEY: Is that for--

01:40:53.262 --> 01:40:55.511
MARISHA: Mm. Totally had this one made for
Scanlan.

01:40:55.511 --> 01:40:56.573
TRAVIS: Mm. Just hold onto it.

01:40:56.573 --> 01:40:57.525
TALIESIN: I say--

01:40:57.525 --> 01:40:59.473
SAM: I understand, and that's fine. I--

01:40:59.473 --> 01:41:02.655
MARISHA: Think I should hold onto it?

01:41:02.655 --> 01:41:03.678
TRAVIS: Yeah, just hold onto it.

01:41:03.678 --> 01:41:04.502
LIAM: Yeah.

01:41:04.502 --> 01:41:05.453
TRAVIS: Don't give it to him.

01:41:05.453 --> 01:41:06.504
LIAM: I mean, this is a--

01:41:06.504 --> 01:41:08.632
MARISHA: But here's a flower! And I Druidcraft him
a flower.

01:41:08.632 --> 01:41:09.571
SAM: Oh!

01:41:09.571 --> 01:41:14.000
LAURA: What a bummer! Oh, I feel like somebody
that just got party invitations,

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.699
it's like oh, I ran out!

01:41:15.699 --> 01:41:19.692
TALIESIN: I make sure Tary gets a little seashell
crown. So.

01:41:19.692 --> 01:41:20.434
MATT: Okay.

01:41:20.434 --> 01:41:21.626
SAM: Thank you. This flower--

01:41:21.626 --> 01:41:24.305
MARISHA: I mean, you can-- do you wanna wear it
for now?

01:41:24.305 --> 01:41:25.624
TALIESIN: We do have to get him an earpiece.

01:41:25.624 --> 01:41:29.836
MATT: As you're staring at the flower and
contemplating the awkwardness, you feel Percival

01:41:29.836 --> 01:41:33.347
slowly come up behind you and just put a little
seashell crown on your head.

01:41:33.347 --> 01:41:34.742
TALIESIN: Long may he reign.

01:41:34.742 --> 01:41:37.284
(all laugh)

01:41:37.338 --> 01:41:40.912
TRAVIS: Oh. My. God. Oh my god.

01:41:41.289 --> 01:41:43.026
TALIESIN: Is there anyone else around, by the
way?

01:41:43.026 --> 01:41:44.279
TRAVIS: Science bro vomit.

01:41:44.279 --> 01:41:46.205
TALIESIN: I wanna check, are we being listened to?
Is there anyone within earshot? Is there

01:41:46.205 --> 01:41:47.032
anything--

01:41:47.032 --> 01:41:48.274
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:41:48.274 --> 01:41:50.376
MARISHA: You know, maybe I should go ahead and
just give this to Tary, I can always have Gilmore

01:41:50.376 --> 01:41:51.453
make another one.

01:41:51.453 --> 01:41:52.293
TALIESIN: 16?

01:41:52.293 --> 01:41:54.857
LAURA: You could always get it back from him if he
decides to leave our presence.

01:41:54.857 --> 01:41:56.954
MATT: I mean, there are folks wandering around,
and there are some people that are kind of just

01:41:56.954 --> 01:41:58.182
younger folk--

01:41:58.182 --> 01:41:59.282
LAURA: It could be safe, if he's---

01:41:59.282 --> 01:42:00.294
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:42:00.294 --> 01:42:02.783
MATT: -- or people that are general denizens of
Vesrah that are just excited that all of a sudden

01:42:02.783 --> 01:42:07.013
these people came in and apparently battled a
kraken and word has gotten around already--

01:42:07.075 --> 01:42:08.493
LAURA: Just let him know it's to hold it.

01:42:08.493 --> 01:42:09.536
MARISHA: Here, Tary.

01:42:09.536 --> 01:42:10.506
SAM: What?

01:42:10.506 --> 01:42:13.393
MARISHA: Just... you did good.

01:42:13.393 --> 01:42:14.567
SAM: You're giving this to me?

01:42:14.567 --> 01:42:16.337
MARISHA: You did good here today.

01:42:16.337 --> 01:42:18.596
SAM: You're giving this to me.

01:42:18.596 --> 01:42:20.687
MARISHA: At least for now. I can probably have
another made--

01:42:20.687 --> 01:42:23.853
SAM: I drop to my knees. My lady,

01:42:23.853 --> 01:42:24.741
TALIESIN: Oh.

01:42:24.741 --> 01:42:25.798
MARISHA: Oh, jeez. Oh.

01:42:25.798 --> 01:42:28.542
SAM: I cannot express to you what this means, to
be accepted as a full-fledged

01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:30.055
member of this team, and--

01:42:30.055 --> 01:42:33.303
(sounds of protest)

01:42:33.303 --> 01:42:35.680
SAM: I knew this day would come, I didn't think so
soon, but--

01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:37.149
TALIESIN: It has not come.

01:42:37.149 --> 01:42:42.705
SAM: -- I suppose, finding that lodestone and
helping you on your 'acapakay'--

01:42:42.705 --> 01:42:43.622
TALIESIN: Ooh.

01:42:43.622 --> 01:42:46.190
LIAM: I lay down on the sand and just close my
eyes.

01:42:46.190 --> 01:42:51.942
SAM: -- was enough to win over your good graces.
I've watched you in these last few battles, and

01:42:51.995 --> 01:42:53.773
you have been powerful--

01:42:53.773 --> 01:42:56.722
MARISHA: Okay-- thank you-- thank you.

01:42:56.722 --> 01:42:57.951
SAM: I wasn't done.

01:42:57.951 --> 01:42:59.519
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:42:59.519 --> 01:43:11.617
SAM: Powerful, confident, and enthralling, and I
vow to use this to the betterment of our entire

01:43:11.617 --> 01:43:19.134
team, to make sure that none of us fall in battle,
not me, not Percy, not you, not either of the

01:43:19.198 --> 01:43:22.180
elves, not short stuff or the big guy.

01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:26.268
ASHLEY: Ooh (laughs). Oh, you're so great.

01:43:26.268 --> 01:43:27.518
MARISHA: Thank you.

01:43:27.518 --> 01:43:28.594
LAURA: He doesn't know our names.

01:43:28.594 --> 01:43:29.761
SAM: Thank you, so much.

01:43:29.761 --> 01:43:30.919
ASHLEY: He doesn't know your names.

01:43:30.919 --> 01:43:32.238
MARISHA: Thank you, thank you. That's--

01:43:32.238 --> 01:43:33.214
TRAVIS: Look what you did.

01:43:33.214 --> 01:43:34.444
SAM: I will cherish it always.

01:43:34.444 --> 01:43:36.054
MARISHA: Yeah, all right, thank-- you're welcome.
Thank you.

01:43:36.054 --> 01:43:39.327
LIAM: Keyleth, you have just passed the final
challenge of your Aramente.

01:43:39.327 --> 01:43:40.609
MARISHA: I think you're right.

01:43:40.609 --> 01:43:42.949
TALIESIN: I wonder--

01:43:42.949 --> 01:43:44.689
MARISHA: I can't take it back from him now. Or
ever.

01:43:44.689 --> 01:43:46.545
MATT: As you put it on, Doty's hand goes--

01:43:46.545 --> 01:43:47.784
SAM: Oh.

01:43:47.784 --> 01:43:48.950
LIAM: Grog will take it back.

01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:50.009
SAM: Oh, he's sketching me?

01:43:50.009 --> 01:43:51.102
MATT: Doty begins sketching you.

01:43:51.102 --> 01:43:52.577
(all laugh)

01:43:52.577 --> 01:43:56.995
SAM: No-- wait 'til I find the light, find the
light, find the light--

01:43:56.995 --> 01:43:59.852
LAURA: Trinket goes up and pees on Doty's leg.

01:43:59.852 --> 01:44:01.996
MATT: (lumbering bear noises)

01:44:01.996 --> 01:44:04.758
LIAM: I'm imagining a really simple etch-a-sketch
drawing.

01:44:04.758 --> 01:44:07.152
MATT: (sniffs, then pee sounds)

01:44:07.152 --> 01:44:09.569
SAM: I don't want to move, I'll break the pose.

01:44:09.569 --> 01:44:10.625
MATT: It's warm.

01:44:10.625 --> 01:44:12.601
LAURA: Oh, Trinket, that's not a tree. That's a
robot.

01:44:12.601 --> 01:44:13.654
MATT: (bear sounds)

01:44:13.654 --> 01:44:14.606
LAURA: Yeah.

01:44:14.606 --> 01:44:15.465
TALIESIN: Oh, dear.

01:44:15.465 --> 01:44:16.486
LAURA: It'll come off. Don't worry.

01:44:16.486 --> 01:44:20.745
MATT: Doty does not seem the least perturbed by
it.

01:44:20.745 --> 01:44:30.825
TALIESIN: Uh.. Keyleth, I've been thinking. What
do you think the Aramente is supposed to teach?

01:44:30.825 --> 01:44:33.393
MARISHA: I've been thinking about that a lot
myself.

01:44:33.393 --> 01:44:39.710
TALIESIN: I'm regretting that I hadn't been
thinking about it until today.

01:44:39.710 --> 01:44:46.152
MARISHA: Well, they don't really tell you much.
Just tell you to go back-- go out into the world

01:44:46.152 --> 01:44:53.402
and prove yourself a leader, with no real
definition on what they think a leader should be.

01:44:53.402 --> 01:44:58.084
TALIESIN: Well, they tell you to go out and gather
a group of friends, and then thrust yourself into

01:44:58.084 --> 01:45:03.159
a death-defying situation that is likely to get
people killed.

01:45:03.159 --> 01:45:08.302
MARISHA: That is one way you could phrase it,
yes.

01:45:08.302 --> 01:45:18.478
TALIESIN: I'm-- and I don't mean to worry you--
just be cautious, I don't-- I have that nagging

01:45:18.478 --> 01:45:25.958
feeling, and I'm hoping it's wrong, but I think it
is possible that they feel you did not lose-- you

01:45:25.958 --> 01:45:29.221
did not learn the lesson of the Aramente.

01:45:29.221 --> 01:45:32.849
MARISHA: Well, that'll be a discussion that I have
with Korren, with my father.

01:45:32.849 --> 01:45:37.797
TALIESIN: What if the lesson is loss? What if
you're supposed to go down there and watch people

01:45:37.797 --> 01:45:39.711
that you love die?

01:45:39.711 --> 01:45:47.042
MARISHA: We're not barbaric! We're not-- no one
wants to lose anyone on an Aramente.

01:45:47.042 --> 01:45:59.610
TALIESIN: The thing that defines the worst leader
a people could have is a lack of empathy.

01:45:59.610 --> 01:46:01.500
MARISHA: Do you think I'm not empathetic?

01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:05.429
TALIESIN: I think that they make sure their
leaders might-- I think it's possible, I don't--

01:46:05.429 --> 01:46:09.893
I'm nervous. I think it's possible that they make
sure their leaders are empathetic by making sure

01:46:09.893 --> 01:46:11.539
they know pain.

01:46:11.539 --> 01:46:17.405
MARISHA: Percy, do you not think that we have
experienced ample amount of pain and loss over the

01:46:17.405 --> 01:46:18.692
course of this?

01:46:18.692 --> 01:46:23.810
TALIESIN: I do, I just hope that it was enough-- I
just-- you know me.

01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:33.220
MARISHA: It's not a blood sacrifice, it's a
tradition, it's meant to show us the world, and

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:36.981
yes it's flawed and I want to fix that.

01:46:36.981 --> 01:46:43.393
TALIESIN: This is beautiful here, and I-- I look
forward to leaving.

01:46:43.393 --> 01:46:45.511
MARISHA: Ha.

01:46:45.511 --> 01:46:53.799
TALIESIN: And I'm very proud of you, but I will be
on my guard, just in case.

01:46:53.799 --> 01:47:00.281
MARISHA: I don't think my traditions really vary
that much from yours, which could still be

01:47:00.281 --> 01:47:05.134
perceived as old-fashioned, if you will?

01:47:05.134 --> 01:47:14.652
TALIESIN: Every farm boy in Whitestone, once he's
old enough to talk and work, names an animal,

01:47:14.652 --> 01:47:18.431
raises it, and butchers it.

01:47:18.431 --> 01:47:26.310
MARISHA: You know, it's interesting, Percy, I've
always looked at you and I as that

01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:34.757
opposites-attract conundrum. As my best friend, I
feel like you are always the natural born leader

01:47:34.757 --> 01:47:44.226
who has been running away from it ever since I met
you, and I'm the one who's not as naturally

01:47:44.226 --> 01:47:47.005
gifted, but is racing towards it faster than--

01:47:47.005 --> 01:47:58.018
TALIESIN: I think I'm too cruel to lead. (sighs)
Regardless, speaking of which, oh boy. Grog.

01:47:58.018 --> 01:47:59.487
TRAVIS: Yes?

01:47:59.487 --> 01:48:12.020
TALIESIN: I have something to say. In a moment of
panic, I may have influenced your decision to save

01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:17.539
Taryon from the kraken. I instantly regretted it--
not because of you, Taryon, I do apologise for

01:48:17.539 --> 01:48:26.723
that-- I instantly regretted it. It was a poor
decision. I fully apologize, and if you wish to

01:48:26.723 --> 01:48:34.651
keep my glasses, I totally understand, and at the
very least, if I have a swift punch in the face

01:48:34.651 --> 01:48:40.291
coming, I completely understand. I'm so sorry. And
I wish I could say I would never do it again, but

01:48:40.291 --> 01:48:44.411
I honestly don't trust myself that much. But I am
really, really sorry, and if anything had happened

01:48:44.411 --> 01:48:48.635
I would have run in to save you as best I could.

01:48:48.635 --> 01:48:51.847
TRAVIS: You look so, like, constipated right now.

01:48:51.847 --> 01:48:53.585
TALIESIN: I think you're gonna punch me.

01:48:53.585 --> 01:48:56.905
(all laugh)

01:48:56.905 --> 01:48:59.612
TRAVIS: How did you influence my decision?

01:48:59.612 --> 01:49:09.547
TALIESIN: It's-- I don't know, sometimes I can
just be unnaturally convincing.

01:49:09.547 --> 01:49:12.476
TRAVIS: Is that a bad thing?

01:49:12.476 --> 01:49:17.738
TALIESIN: In the wrong hands, which are my hands
on occasion. I felt bad. I feel bad. I feel like I

01:49:17.738 --> 01:49:25.234
did-- I was not a good-- I feel like I made a poor
decision, and put you in peril, and subverted your

01:49:25.234 --> 01:49:27.827
free will. Does that make-- Uh, no.

01:49:27.827 --> 01:49:29.167
LAURA: (laughs)

01:49:29.167 --> 01:49:30.758
TALIESIN: Small words.

01:49:30.758 --> 01:49:34.234
MATT: You do, Grog, recall as you guys were
swimming up to Vesrah, and you were kind of

01:49:34.234 --> 01:49:39.516
following up to the path, you thought, why did I
save Taryon?

01:49:39.516 --> 01:49:41.604
TRAVIS: Yeah, why did I save Taryon?

01:49:41.604 --> 01:49:45.172
TALIESIN: Because I'm a jerk. That's why you saved
Taryon, 'cause I'm--

01:49:45.172 --> 01:49:47.876
because I can be a bad friend.

01:49:47.876 --> 01:49:51.183
TRAVIS: Mm. What does that have to do with me?

01:49:51.183 --> 01:49:57.236
TALIESIN: I just am trying to be honest with you,
because I respect you, and I would hate for you to

01:49:57.236 --> 01:49:59.853
think that-- I-- (sighs) Terrible at this.

01:49:59.853 --> 01:50:00.983
MARISHA: Are you all right, Percy?

01:50:00.983 --> 01:50:04.961
TALIESIN: No, I'm not all right. I've made some
bad decisions today and I've terrible thoughts

01:50:04.961 --> 01:50:07.347
and-- Ugh, I'm so tired.

01:50:07.347 --> 01:50:08.561
TRAVIS: Tary?

01:50:08.561 --> 01:50:10.266
SAM: Yes, sir?

01:50:10.266 --> 01:50:12.270
TRAVIS: Are you glad you're alive?

01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:14.313
SAM: Extremely.

01:50:14.313 --> 01:50:16.891
TRAVIS: Well, there you go.

01:50:16.891 --> 01:50:19.893
TALIESIN: How about we just say I owe you one?

01:50:19.893 --> 01:50:20.951
TRAVIS: I owe you one?

01:50:20.951 --> 01:50:22.014
TALIESIN: I owe you one.

01:50:22.014 --> 01:50:23.369
TRAVIS: I thought you said I say I owe you one.

01:50:23.369 --> 01:50:23.970
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:50:23.970 --> 01:50:27.619
TALIESIN: No, well, you can say that, too, but
just know that-- that I owe you one.

01:50:27.619 --> 01:50:28.635
I owe you-- what-- It's--

01:50:28.635 --> 01:50:29.684
TRAVIS: How would that even work?

01:50:29.684 --> 01:50:30.401
TALIESIN: That would work--

01:50:30.401 --> 01:50:32.230
TRAVIS: We'd just be owing each other forever.

01:50:32.230 --> 01:50:36.135
TALIESIN: I just-- Have some seashells... And a
skipping rock.

01:50:36.135 --> 01:50:38.089
TRAVIS: Ooh!

01:50:38.089 --> 01:50:40.006
(all laugh)

01:50:40.006 --> 01:50:41.189
TALIESIN: I feel better. That's all I needed.

01:50:41.189 --> 01:50:42.184
TRAVIS: I leave.

01:50:42.184 --> 01:50:43.433
TALIESIN: That's all I needed, I feel better.

01:50:43.433 --> 01:50:44.266
LAURA: Don't worry, Percy, he makes it--

01:50:44.266 --> 01:50:46.270
MATT: (laughs) As Grog walks away with a skipping
rock--

01:50:46.270 --> 01:50:47.497
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:50:47.497 --> 01:50:51.498
LIAM: Somewhere in the middle of all that serious
talk, I've pulled my sister off to the side and--

01:50:51.498 --> 01:50:52.486
TRAVIS: (laughs) So good.

01:50:52.486 --> 01:50:56.901
LIAM: -- have cajoled her into playing Airship.
You know, when, so-- we used to do this as kids--

01:50:56.901 --> 01:50:57.995
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:50:57.995 --> 01:50:58.945
LIAM: -- I lay on my back--

01:50:58.945 --> 01:50:59.746
LAURA: (gasps)

01:50:59.746 --> 01:51:00.551
LIAM: -- and I lift her up in the air--

01:51:00.551 --> 01:51:01.511
LAURA: Yeeeah!

01:51:01.511 --> 01:51:02.369
LIAM: -- with my feet holding her up--

01:51:02.369 --> 01:51:03.387
LAURA: I love this game!

01:51:03.387 --> 01:51:04.446
LIAM: -- and I'm kind of in pain but I can kinda
do it.

01:51:04.446 --> 01:51:05.370
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:51:05.370 --> 01:51:06.490
LAURA: How do you even have strength for this
right now?

01:51:06.490 --> 01:51:09.197
LIAM: (groans) I am ropy as fuck.

01:51:09.197 --> 01:51:10.147
LAURA: (laughs)

01:51:10.147 --> 01:51:12.735
LIAM: We are almost even now--

01:51:12.735 --> 01:51:13.712
LAURA: In what?

01:51:13.712 --> 01:51:15.662
LIAM: Well, we're twins, so, you've died, I've
died.

01:51:15.662 --> 01:51:16.493
(all laugh)

01:51:16.493 --> 01:51:18.358
LAURA: Oh, right! I thought you meant in size.

01:51:18.358 --> 01:51:19.615
LIAM: No, no, no.

01:51:19.615 --> 01:51:20.508
ASHLEY: (laughs)

01:51:20.508 --> 01:51:22.094
LIAM: But you've died twice. So--

01:51:22.094 --> 01:51:23.442
LAURA: Yes, I have.

01:51:23.442 --> 01:51:25.332
LIAM: You are more ambitious than I am.

01:51:25.332 --> 01:51:27.727
LAURA: (laughs) We've always known that.

01:51:27.727 --> 01:51:31.403
LIAM: (laughs) Yeah. You know, we really need a
break.

01:51:31.403 --> 01:51:33.347
LAURA: Yes, we do.

01:51:33.347 --> 01:51:37.300
LIAM: I think we're going to hell soon,
literally-- But maybe after that, maybe we could

01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:38.715
take a break.

01:51:38.715 --> 01:51:46.304
LAURA: I don't know if that's going to happen,
dear. I sort of made a promise to your queen.

01:51:46.304 --> 01:51:50.496
Could you hear it on the other side?

01:51:51.143 --> 01:51:56.279
LIAM: I don't remember anything.

01:51:56.279 --> 01:52:03.386
LAURA: When we were trying to bring you back, I
kind of sort of-- And I come down off of his feet

01:52:03.386 --> 01:52:04.459
(laughs) and stand up--

01:52:04.459 --> 01:52:05.436
LIAM: (painful groaning)

01:52:05.436 --> 01:52:10.546
LAURA: I kind of, sort of promised her we would
hunt down Orcus.

01:52:10.546 --> 01:52:14.655
MATT: You do recall hearing those-- As she says
this, you remember now the various things that

01:52:14.655 --> 01:52:20.965
were said, as the ritual's kinda coming to
clarity. And you realize the immensity of the

01:52:20.965 --> 01:52:23.786
offer that was given.

01:52:23.786 --> 01:52:29.247
LAURA: I mean, I was trying to get you back. I
know that is really hard and we probably are going

01:52:29.247 --> 01:52:34.981
to have a very hard time finding Orcus and killing
him since he's like, you know, a god, I think--

01:52:34.981 --> 01:52:36.189
TRAVIS: Ooh, ooh!

01:52:36.189 --> 01:52:37.402
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:52:37.402 --> 01:52:41.318
LAURA: Hey, you're here now! (snaps fingers) I'm
sorry.

01:52:41.318 --> 01:52:44.312
LIAM: Hey, man, no judgment, it means you're just
like me.

01:52:44.312 --> 01:52:49.403
LAURA: Yeah, right? Stupid decisions to bring the
people you love back to your side. Very stupid.

01:52:49.403 --> 01:52:50.823
LIAM: What the fuck else are you gonna do?

01:52:50.823 --> 01:52:54.403
LAURA: Stupid to be a champion, stupid to kill
Orcus, stupid all around.

01:52:54.403 --> 01:52:55.764
LIAM: Did you give a timeline?

01:52:55.764 --> 01:53:01.225
LAURA: No, no, no! I just kind of said we'd go and
do it. So, it could be, you know. Ah, I just said

01:53:01.225 --> 01:53:02.770
we would do it.

01:53:02.770 --> 01:53:14.119
LIAM: No, you know, in all seriousness, I have
been waiting for something. I don't know what. But

01:53:14.119 --> 01:53:16.115
I'm not running towards it.

01:53:16.115 --> 01:53:17.214
LAURA: (laughs)

01:53:17.214 --> 01:53:18.568
LIAM: I think we'll get there.

01:53:18.568 --> 01:53:25.085
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. I have a feeling she pulls our
fate strings anyway.

01:53:25.085 --> 01:53:26.894
She'll make sure we get there.

01:53:26.894 --> 01:53:28.432
LIAM: (sighs)

01:53:28.432 --> 01:53:35.520
LAURA: Mine's connected to yours. Wherever you go,
I go. Unless it's, you know--

01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:36.741
LIAM: I start to cry a little bit.

01:53:36.741 --> 01:53:44.090
LAURA: (laughs) Aw! I'm glad you're back.

01:53:44.090 --> 01:53:48.945
LIAM: I don't say anything.

01:53:48.945 --> 01:53:51.930
MATT: You hear what sounds like a whip crack of
thunder.

01:53:51.930 --> 01:53:53.001
SAM: (gasps)

01:53:53.001 --> 01:53:55.839
MATT: As you glance over your shoulder and watch
as Grog with the Titanstone Knuckles

01:53:55.839 --> 01:53:58.183
skips a stone so hard--

01:53:58.183 --> 01:53:59.151
(all laugh)

01:53:59.151 --> 01:54:03.552
MATT: -- that it shatters into multiple pieces upon
making contact with the water.

01:54:03.552 --> 01:54:05.336
ASHLEY: (claps) Grog!

01:54:05.336 --> 01:54:06.565
LAURA: (claps) Grog!

01:54:06.565 --> 01:54:08.200
TALIESIN: (slow claps) I can die happy now that I
saw that.

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:08.972
LAURA: That was amazing!

01:54:08.972 --> 01:54:09.746
ASHLEY: That was cool!

01:54:09.746 --> 01:54:10.809
MARISHA: That was awesome!

01:54:10.809 --> 01:54:11.926
TRAVIS: Is that a record?

01:54:11.926 --> 01:54:12.823
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:54:12.823 --> 01:54:13.670
TALIESIN: It may be.

01:54:13.670 --> 01:54:14.421
ASHLEY: Probably.

01:54:14.421 --> 01:54:15.138
TRAVIS: Wow.

01:54:15.138 --> 01:54:16.425
LAURA: I write ten on a sheet of paper and hold it
up.

01:54:16.425 --> 01:54:17.339
(all laugh)

01:54:17.339 --> 01:54:18.335
TRAVIS: Where'd you get that paper from?

01:54:18.335 --> 01:54:19.185
LAURA: I have it in my bag.

01:54:19.185 --> 01:54:20.002
ASHLEY: (laughs)

01:54:20.002 --> 01:54:20.656
TARVIS: That's amazing.

01:54:20.656 --> 01:54:21.303
LAURA: I know.

01:54:21.303 --> 01:54:22.386
LIAM: I think you just hit Whitestone.

01:54:22.386 --> 01:54:23.303
(all laugh)

01:54:23.303 --> 01:54:26.447
TALIESIN: I'm showing Pike the jewelry I'm
bringing back. So, since I can't give it to you

01:54:26.447 --> 01:54:27.894
now, I'm just modeling it.

01:54:27.894 --> 01:54:28.653
ASHLEY: Oh, it's--

01:54:28.653 --> 01:54:30.539
TALIESIN: It's a little hand thing, it's got some
tie things.

01:54:30.539 --> 01:54:34.743
ASHLEY: (gasps) Percy, it's beautiful! I want it
now.

01:54:34.743 --> 01:54:37.048
TALIESIN: I don't know if that will go well.

01:54:37.048 --> 01:54:38.086
LAURA: It will fall off of your form.

01:54:38.086 --> 01:54:39.089
TALIESIN: Patience!

01:54:39.089 --> 01:54:41.214
LIAM: Does it sink through-- slowly through the
Jello?

01:54:41.214 --> 01:54:42.115
TALIESIN: I'll clean it off.

01:54:42.115 --> 01:54:43.563
(all laugh)

01:54:43.563 --> 01:54:51.315
MATT: As the afternoon comes to a close and the
sun slowly sets on the distant ocean horizon,

01:54:51.360 --> 01:55:00.989
the lights begin to brighten anew to usher in the
eveningscape of Vesrah. A similar gathering of

01:55:00.989 --> 01:55:06.724
the people of Vesrah that you celebrated with the
evening before comes to life, even more vibrant

01:55:06.876 --> 01:55:16.421
and excited at the tale of an Aramente completed.
As this is transpiring, you guys are brought in,

01:55:16.421 --> 01:55:18.376
food is prepared--

01:55:18.376 --> 01:55:20.185
MARISHA: I'm in my fancy clothes, by the way.

01:55:20.185 --> 01:55:25.199
MATT: Okay, yeah, fair enough. You guys-- wherever
you can, as you guys--

01:55:25.199 --> 01:55:26.960
LAURA: Ooh, seashell bras.

01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:28.109
LIAM: I'm in the Deathwalker's Ward.

01:55:28.109 --> 01:55:30.803
(all laugh)

01:55:30.803 --> 01:55:32.101
LAURA: With salt crusted on it.

01:55:32.101 --> 01:55:35.334
MARISHA: Yeah, it's still a little soggy and
damp.

01:55:35.334 --> 01:55:40.230
MATT: As you guys are getting ready and brought
into this, and people are beginning to come up and

01:55:40.230 --> 01:55:47.396
congratulate you, bringing their kids up to shake
the hands of the future Voice of the Tempest, you

01:55:47.396 --> 01:55:52.532
watch as a group of figures appears on the
outskirts of the light in this central meeting

01:55:52.532 --> 01:55:57.209
area. You glance over and watch as all of a sudden
the nervousness kicks in, and everyone turns and

01:55:57.209 --> 01:56:03.566
looks, as there, dipping into the light, you see
Captain Adella and the crew going, "Okay, so we've

01:56:03.566 --> 01:56:07.965
"been waiting for quite a while and it looks like
you're having a party without us.

01:56:07.965 --> 01:56:11.245
"So. Mind if we join in?"

01:56:11.245 --> 01:56:13.455
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on!

01:56:13.455 --> 01:56:14.428
MATT: "Told you!"

01:56:14.428 --> 01:56:15.172
TALIESIN: Pour.

01:56:15.172 --> 01:56:16.110
MARISHA: Toss a drink, yeah.

01:56:16.110 --> 01:56:19.471
MATT: And the rest of the crew comes in, of the
Drensala Vis.

01:56:19.471 --> 01:56:22.811
LAURA: What about the prisoner? Is he still on
board?

01:56:22.811 --> 01:56:26.358
MATT: "Oh yeah, no, we're leaving that fucker on
the ship. We're not taking him here."

01:56:26.358 --> 01:56:29.365
LAURA: All right.

01:56:29.365 --> 01:56:33.317
MATT: "So. Everything went fine, I suppose?"

01:56:33.317 --> 01:56:34.416
LIAM: Peachy-peachy.

01:56:34.416 --> 01:56:35.396
MATT: "Great."

01:56:35.396 --> 01:56:36.235
MARISHA: Right as rain.

01:56:36.235 --> 01:56:37.572
MATT: "Fantastic. Going back soon, then, huh?

01:56:37.572 --> 01:56:40.384
ALL: Yes.

01:56:40.384 --> 01:56:43.208
MATT: "Great, first light of the morning, let's
get back."

01:56:43.208 --> 01:56:44.900
TRAVIS: Are you in a rush?

01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:51.496
MATT: "No, but the longer we're here, the more
time we spend out wandering amongst the reef with

01:56:51.496 --> 01:57:04.708
"these people." And she glances around, and as you
look around, you do see a very comparably bohemian

01:57:04.708 --> 01:57:07.916
lifestyle of the water ashari.

01:57:07.916 --> 01:57:09.525
LIAM: Eyes Wide Shut?

01:57:09.525 --> 01:57:11.098
MATT: Not quite that level.

01:57:11.098 --> 01:57:13.578
MARISHA: What's your definition of bohemian?

01:57:13.578 --> 01:57:14.570
MATT: Yeah!

01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:15.348
LIAM: Eyes Wide Shut.

01:57:15.348 --> 01:57:17.676
(all laugh)

01:57:17.676 --> 01:57:19.577
MATT: I'm so glad you don't live in Los Villas.

01:57:19.577 --> 01:57:22.397
SAM: Like Venice people? Like beachy hippies.

01:57:22.397 --> 01:57:25.072
MATT: Yeah, it's very Venice Beach.

01:57:25.072 --> 01:57:29.766
TALIESIN: Like Labyrinth muppets, maybe. Like the
creepy head Labyrinth muppets.

01:57:29.766 --> 01:57:31.155
LIAM: Everybody looks like the Raven Queen.

01:57:31.155 --> 01:57:33.322
(all laugh)

01:57:33.322 --> 01:57:45.083
MATT: But yeah. Drinks are had, the party
celebrates, and then eventually Uvenda begins to

01:57:45.083 --> 01:57:49.562
approach, and everyone gets quiet, and she walks
up towards you, Keyleth, and reaches out to take

01:57:49.562 --> 01:58:02.065
your hand, both of your hands in hers. "In
completing the trial of the water ashari, I impart

01:58:02.065 --> 01:58:14.265
"unto you now a gift. Something I, as far as I
understand, have only been around long enough to

01:58:14.265 --> 01:58:20.706
"learn. But seeing the strength that you hold,
perhaps you can wield this as well."

01:58:21.561 --> 01:58:22.620
MARISHA: Okay?

01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:27.055
MATT: As she takes your hands, she folds them over
each other, and she encloses them in her tiny

01:58:27.055 --> 01:58:38.243
gnomish grasp. "Close your eyes." As you close
your eyes, and you can hear the hush of people

01:58:38.243 --> 01:58:50.832
silencing each other around. "Now, the form of one
who protects the elements is malleable. You can

01:58:50.832 --> 01:59:02.263
"transcend this particular form and become the
beasts of nature. You can become the creatures of

01:59:02.308 --> 01:59:12.177
"the elements that we safeguard. However, those
who've mastered the journey that you have? They

01:59:12.177 --> 01:59:19.646
"can become so much more. Now walk with me." And
she tugs on your hand. "Keep your eyes closed, but

01:59:19.646 --> 01:59:25.947
"walk with me." And you guys watch as she backs up
and leads Keyleth out of the pavilion, out into

01:59:25.947 --> 01:59:34.073
the darkness in the center of the main
thoroughfare of Vesrah. The crowd wanders along,

01:59:34.073 --> 01:59:40.401
if you guys want to shuffle with. She leads
Keyleth out, eyes still closed, and as soon as

01:59:40.401 --> 01:59:44.131
people start crowding in, she goes, (huff of
breath), and the guards hold people back and leave a

01:59:44.131 --> 01:59:54.897
wide berth around. "Now. Keyleth. You've
encountered many beasts, many dangerous and

01:59:54.957 --> 02:00:03.042
"powerful creatures from all walks of the planes.
Pick one."

02:00:03.042 --> 02:00:05.513
SAM: (gasps)

02:00:06.114 --> 02:00:08.472
MATT: "What do you see in your mind?"

02:00:10.911 --> 02:00:14.306
MARISHA: I think of the goristro, Yenk.

02:00:15.530 --> 02:00:25.164
MATT: "Imagine what it's like to be filled with
strength, to be filled with the power. Envision

02:00:25.164 --> 02:00:33.252
"the horns, the snarl, the barrel-like fists." And
you guys watch as Keyleth's form suddenly begins

02:00:33.252 --> 02:00:40.204
to shift and grow and where once was a half-elf
Keyleth, you now see, towering above this tiny

02:00:40.204 --> 02:00:44.025
gnome, eyes still closed, a massive goristro.

02:00:44.025 --> 02:00:46.034
TRAVIS: No fucking way.

02:00:46.034 --> 02:00:47.730
TALIESIN: Oh, well, that's disconcerting.

02:00:47.730 --> 02:00:55.362
MATT: Everyone goes (gasps) and as her hands leave
yours, you feel something shift and change and you

02:00:55.423 --> 02:01:02.002
hear the slightly more distant voice of Uvenda
say, "Now open your eyes." And you look down--

02:01:02.002 --> 02:01:03.271
MARISHA: (screams)

02:01:03.271 --> 02:01:04.785
MATT: (laughs)

02:01:04.785 --> 02:01:06.276
TALIESIN: That's less disconcerting.

02:01:06.276 --> 02:01:07.832
LAURA: Is she stuck like that?

02:01:07.832 --> 02:01:10.210
MATT: "No, no, she's fine. This is under her
control."

02:01:10.210 --> 02:01:11.720
LAURA: Okay.

02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:13.113
LIAM: She's fine.

02:01:13.113 --> 02:01:21.817
MATT: "This incantation is yours now. Be what you
wish. Use these creatures."

02:01:21.817 --> 02:01:23.690
MARISHA: I turn into a beholder.

02:01:23.690 --> 02:01:24.819
MATT: (swoosh) You watch as all her body--

02:01:24.819 --> 02:01:26.029
TRAVIS: Shut the fuck up.

02:01:26.029 --> 02:01:26.957
MATT: -- shifts and becomes--

02:01:26.957 --> 02:01:28.092
TRAVIS: Shut up.

02:01:28.092 --> 02:01:31.282
MATT: -- a meaty mass with a singular eye and many
eyestalks and you watch as everyone takes two

02:01:31.333 --> 02:01:33.099
steps back (gasps)--

02:01:33.099 --> 02:01:34.499
TRAVIS: You can not do that now!

02:01:34.499 --> 02:01:35.991
LAURA: What is this?! What is this?!

02:01:35.991 --> 02:01:37.202
What the fuck?!

02:01:37.202 --> 02:01:39.788
TRAVIS: Are you serious?!

02:01:39.858 --> 02:01:40.820
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:01:40.820 --> 02:01:41.781
LAURA: What is this?!

02:01:41.781 --> 02:01:42.803
MARISHA: I am a golden god!

02:01:42.803 --> 02:01:44.180
(all laugh)

02:01:44.180 --> 02:01:46.124
MATT: "Your shape is yours to change, Keyleth."

02:01:46.124 --> 02:01:55.055
MARISHA: I change into-- adult bronze dragon.

02:01:55.055 --> 02:01:58.789
MATT: You watch as the beholder that's looking
around excitedly suddenly shifts and grows two

02:01:58.789 --> 02:02:01.073
large bronze wings--

02:02:01.073 --> 02:02:02.068
ASHLEY: (laughs)

02:02:02.068 --> 02:02:04.461
MATT: -- claws emerge and the head extends.

02:02:04.461 --> 02:02:05.927
TALIESIN: Oh dear.

02:02:05.927 --> 02:02:08.082
LIAM: That is really hot.

02:02:08.082 --> 02:02:10.158
LAURA: But like, that's really big. How?

02:02:10.158 --> 02:02:11.740
MARISHA: I do a victory lap (whoosh).

02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:12.758
MATT: (whoosh whoosh)

02:02:12.758 --> 02:02:15.090
LAURA: How is this possible?

02:02:15.090 --> 02:02:16.222
TRAVIS: Can she do the stuff they do?

02:02:16.222 --> 02:02:20.020
LAURA: Is she like a dragon for real? Does
anybody--?

02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:22.968
MATT: Uvenda turns to you as you're shouting this,
everyone's kinda watching her fly over, you can

02:02:22.968 --> 02:02:27.829
see the little bit of light that glows from the
city occasionally reflect off the metallic

02:02:27.829 --> 02:02:34.133
underbody of the dragon as it circles overhead in
the dark night sky. Uvenda turns to you and goes,

02:02:34.133 --> 02:02:39.470
"Ah yes. Don't worry. These forms are hers to
control."

02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:43.644
MARISHA: I turn and-- brass dragons have fire
breath, right? Do they have fire breath?

02:02:43.644 --> 02:02:45.000
MATT: I'm pretty sure.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:45.805
LAURA: No.

02:02:45.805 --> 02:02:46.902
TALIESIN: Very frightening.

02:02:46.902 --> 02:02:49.297
MARISHA: I do-- into the air, I just go (kwoosh)

02:02:49.297 --> 02:02:51.462
MATT: I'm gonna look this up real fast so the
internet doesn't hate me.

02:02:51.462 --> 02:02:52.498
MARISHA: See what happens.

02:02:52.498 --> 02:02:53.737
TRAVIS: You kill everyone on the ground.

02:02:53.737 --> 02:02:56.324
(all laugh)

02:02:56.324 --> 02:03:07.043
MATT: Yeah, it is fire breath. So you watch as she
flies off, she shoots forth this burning hot,

02:03:07.043 --> 02:03:16.103
bright jet of singular focused fire, not a
napalm-level red dragon cone breath, but a

02:03:16.103 --> 02:03:22.691
singular focused beam of burning fire that just
lights up all of Vesrah around. You see the

02:03:22.691 --> 02:03:29.246
hundreds of the denizens around go, "Oh!" as their
faces glow against the dark sky around you.

02:03:29.523 --> 02:03:32.967
LAURA: I feel far less nervous about this Orcus
thing now.

02:03:32.967 --> 02:03:33.965
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:03:33.965 --> 02:03:35.019
LIAM: What was that?

02:03:35.019 --> 02:03:36.268
LAURA: Ha. (laughs)

02:03:36.268 --> 02:03:37.525
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Wow.

02:03:37.525 --> 02:03:39.683
LAURA: That's insane.

02:03:40.087 --> 02:03:43.356
MATT: Uvenda's just looking up and smiling,
clasping her hands together.

02:03:43.404 --> 02:03:45.792
TRAVIS: Who needs a fucking magic carpet now?

02:03:45.792 --> 02:03:47.198
MARISHA: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!

02:03:47.198 --> 02:03:48.427
TRAVIS: We got a jumbo jet.

02:03:48.427 --> 02:03:50.869
MARISHA: I come back down and I come down and I'm
like (animal noises).

02:03:50.869 --> 02:03:52.809
LAURA: Can't you talk as a dragon? Can't dragons
talk?

02:03:52.809 --> 02:03:53.673
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.

02:03:53.673 --> 02:03:54.709
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:55.790
MARISHA: I'm so used to Beast Shape!

02:03:55.790 --> 02:03:56.695
(all laugh)

02:03:56.695 --> 02:03:57.800
MARISHA: I'm so used to not being able to fucking
talk!

02:03:57.800 --> 02:03:59.205
LIAM: She's gesturing and I'm already climbing on.

02:03:59.205 --> 02:04:02.659
TRAVIS: (animal noises) Oh she can change into a
dragon but she's-- yeah.

02:04:02.659 --> 02:04:05.742
ASHLEY: If I touch her, does she feel like a
dragon?

02:04:05.742 --> 02:04:09.644
MATT: Yeah. You feel the hard scales across her
hide.

02:04:09.644 --> 02:04:10.702
MARISHA: So I can talk?

02:04:10.702 --> 02:04:11.493
MATT: Yeah.

02:04:11.493 --> 02:04:14.076
MARISHA: Hey guys! Guys, check it out! Ah, Ah.

02:04:14.076 --> 02:04:16.883
LAURA: I like the idea that it's just like your
regular-ass voice coming out of--

02:04:16.883 --> 02:04:19.458
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm like, ah guys! Got little
antlers.

02:04:19.458 --> 02:04:25.414
TALIESIN: This went so FernGully so quickly.

02:04:25.414 --> 02:04:30.186
MATT: Yeah. It's Keyleth's voice but it's deeper,
it's resonating, it quakes the sand on the ground

02:04:30.186 --> 02:04:31.969
near her when she speaks.

02:04:31.969 --> 02:04:34.690
TRAVIS: (deep voice) Hey guys.

02:04:34.690 --> 02:04:35.639
LAURA: What the fuck. What is this?

02:04:35.639 --> 02:04:36.892
TRAVIS: (deep voice) It's me, Keyleth.

02:04:36.892 --> 02:04:37.700
LAURA: Like, this is amazing, Keyleth.

02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:39.358
MARISHA: This is-- I don't know.

02:04:39.358 --> 02:04:40.519
SAM: (whispering) She's amazing.

02:04:40.519 --> 02:04:42.336
LAURA: We should have completed your Aramente a
lot sooner.

02:04:42.336 --> 02:04:43.614
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:04:43.614 --> 02:04:46.739
MARISHA: You wanna go for a ride?

02:04:46.739 --> 02:04:48.819
TRAVIS: (deep voice) I'm so happy right now.

02:04:48.819 --> 02:04:49.623
LAURA: Yes!

02:04:49.623 --> 02:04:50.319
ASHLEY: Yeah!

02:04:50.319 --> 02:04:51.622
MARISHA: Okay, all right. I pick up the
half-elves.

02:04:51.622 --> 02:04:52.381
LAURA: And Pike!

02:04:52.381 --> 02:04:53.111
TRAVIS: Hey, hey!

02:04:53.111 --> 02:04:53.875
LAURA: Pike wanted to go too.

02:04:53.875 --> 02:04:54.545
MARISHA: And Pike!

02:04:54.545 --> 02:04:55.251
ASHLEY: I did want to go. I want to go.

02:04:55.251 --> 02:04:56.138
LIAM: Don't let the jello fall apart.

02:04:56.138 --> 02:04:56.952
TALIESIN: There's always room for jello.

02:04:56.952 --> 02:04:58.111
ASHLEY: It's fine if I fall apart. It happens.

02:04:58.111 --> 02:05:03.469
MATT: Okay, as the tinier folks step onto the back
of Keyleth-dragon, they take off into the sky. You

02:05:03.469 --> 02:05:06.349
watch as a bunch of the children now begin to try
and line up now.

02:05:06.349 --> 02:05:07.303
ALL: Aw.

02:05:07.303 --> 02:05:09.514
MATT: And the parents are like, mm-hm.

02:05:09.514 --> 02:05:10.782
MARISHA: Yes.

02:05:10.782 --> 02:05:12.741
TRAVIS: I am clearly moving ahead of them to the
front of the fucking line.

02:05:12.741 --> 02:05:13.659
(all laugh)

02:05:13.659 --> 02:05:15.117
MATT: As Grog forces himself to the front of the
line--

02:05:15.117 --> 02:05:16.290
ASHLEY: I was here first.

02:05:16.290 --> 02:05:20.049
MATT: -- like palms a child and just pushes it
back, like Old School, just (pff) out of the way.

02:05:20.049 --> 02:05:20.921
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:05:20.921 --> 02:05:24.491
MARISHA: And I totally spend the next hour giving
joy-rides to anyone who wants to.

02:05:24.491 --> 02:05:27.992
MATT: And yeah, most of the folks of Vesrah begin
to start giving in to it--

02:05:27.992 --> 02:05:28.853
MARISHA: Dragon rides.

02:05:28.853 --> 02:05:29.747
LAURA: Wow.

02:05:29.747 --> 02:05:32.070
MATT: -- taking dragon rides from Keyleth over the
night sky (laughs).

02:05:32.070 --> 02:05:33.951
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Wow.

02:05:33.951 --> 02:05:37.267
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

02:05:37.267 --> 02:05:38.351
MARISHA: I leveled up.

02:05:38.351 --> 02:05:39.357
LAURA: That's pretty fucking sick.

02:05:39.357 --> 02:05:41.503
MATT: Yeah, and in fact, I'll go look at the
logistics of this, but after that kraken battle,

02:05:41.503 --> 02:05:43.356
most everybody leveled up on that.

02:05:43.356 --> 02:05:44.737
LAURA: Yeah!

02:05:44.737 --> 02:05:46.892
MATT: I'll send that out tonight via email to you
guys.

02:05:46.892 --> 02:05:47.685
TALIESIN: Oh god.

02:05:47.685 --> 02:05:48.528
LAURA: Sweet!

02:05:48.528 --> 02:05:49.522
MARISHA: So that's Shapechange, right?

02:05:49.522 --> 02:05:52.363
MATT: You have Shapechange as one of a possible
9th-level spell.

02:05:52.363 --> 02:05:53.763
SAM: What is Shapechange?

02:05:53.763 --> 02:05:54.541
LIAM: That!

02:05:54.541 --> 02:05:55.333
SAM: You can just become anything?

02:05:55.333 --> 02:05:56.465
LAURA: It's a ninth-level spell.

02:05:56.465 --> 02:06:00.211
MARISHA: I can change into anything that's a
challenge rating of my level or lower.

02:06:00.211 --> 02:06:01.139
SAM: Once?

02:06:01.139 --> 02:06:01.840
LAURA: Wait.

02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:02.704
SAM: Or constantly?

02:06:02.704 --> 02:06:03.491
MARISHA: For an hour.

02:06:03.491 --> 02:06:04.657
LAURA: Dragons are your level?

02:06:04.657 --> 02:06:05.739
MARISHA: Adult dragons are.

02:06:05.739 --> 02:06:06.775
MATT: An adult one. Not an ancient.

02:06:06.775 --> 02:06:07.675
LAURA: Okay.

02:06:07.675 --> 02:06:08.377
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:06:08.377 --> 02:06:09.110
SAM: Wow.

02:06:09.110 --> 02:06:11.757
LAURA: Wow, still, adult dragon is like, right on
par.

02:06:11.757 --> 02:06:12.597
MATT: It's not bad.

02:06:12.597 --> 02:06:14.288
LIAM: Guys, we've been playing this campaign for a
while.

02:06:14.288 --> 02:06:16.238
(all laugh)

02:06:16.238 --> 02:06:17.338
TRAVIS: This is amazing.

02:06:17.338 --> 02:06:19.089
MARISHA: (sighs) I wasn't sure if I was ever gonna
get here.

02:06:19.089 --> 02:06:20.219
TRAVIS: Fucking amazing.

02:06:20.219 --> 02:06:25.725
MARISHA: (heavy sigh) Yeah I can. It's for an hour
and I can keep shapechanging into different things

02:06:25.725 --> 02:06:26.519
for an hour.

02:06:26.519 --> 02:06:28.150
TRAVIS: You can whip those beholder eyes at
people?

02:06:28.150 --> 02:06:29.007
MARISHA: Yes, I can.

02:06:29.007 --> 02:06:29.966
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:06:29.966 --> 02:06:30.878
LIAM: Holy shit.

02:06:30.878 --> 02:06:31.823
SAM: Wow.

02:06:31.823 --> 02:06:33.119
LAURA: And you can do all the things that they can
do?

02:06:33.119 --> 02:06:34.780
TRAVIS: Is it at will or is it a random roll for
which eye does what?

02:06:34.780 --> 02:06:39.916
MARISHA: It's like Beast Shape, so I keep my
intellect, my wisdom, and my charisma, but I take

02:06:39.916 --> 02:06:41.456
on their physical stats--

02:06:41.456 --> 02:06:42.170
LAURA: Ah!

02:06:42.170 --> 02:06:43.393
MARISHA: -- and their abilities.

02:06:43.393 --> 02:06:44.431
ASHLEY: You're a beast.

02:06:44.431 --> 02:06:47.221
TRAVIS: And same thing, like you drop the shape's
hit points and then it reverts back to you.

02:06:47.221 --> 02:06:47.979
MARISHA: Yep.

02:06:47.979 --> 02:06:48.935
MATT: You don't get legendary actions--

02:06:48.935 --> 02:06:49.799
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:06:49.799 --> 02:06:50.646
MARISHA: I know!

02:06:50.646 --> 02:06:51.715
MATT: -- or lair actions but you get all the rest
of the abilities

02:06:51.715 --> 02:06:53.219
and physical attributes of the creature.

02:06:53.219 --> 02:06:54.080
SAM: Wow.

02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:55.057
LAURA: I'd say that's pretty fucking sick.

02:06:55.057 --> 02:06:55.945
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

02:06:55.945 --> 02:06:57.858
LIAM: Forget about strawberry, how about
raw-berry!

02:06:57.858 --> 02:07:00.644
(all laugh)

02:07:00.644 --> 02:07:01.963
LAURA: Ah man.

02:07:01.963 --> 02:07:03.504
TALIESIN: Juice Springsteen.

02:07:03.504 --> 02:07:04.386
ASHLEY: Holy cow.

02:07:04.386 --> 02:07:08.878
MATT: So eventually, as you feel the spell begin
to dissipate, the shapechange coming to an end,

02:07:08.878 --> 02:07:13.478
you bring the last cluster of children and Grog,
who has ridden now seven times.

02:07:13.478 --> 02:07:15.889
(all laugh)

02:07:15.889 --> 02:07:17.517
LIAM: (deep voice) Whee!

02:07:17.517 --> 02:07:18.999
TRAVIS: Ah!

02:07:18.999 --> 02:07:23.155
MATT: As the night draws to a close--

02:07:23.155 --> 02:07:28.612
MARISHA: As the spell fades, I just give Grog a
big hug and just kinda cry tears of joy into his

02:07:28.612 --> 02:07:29.752
chest for a little bit.

02:07:29.752 --> 02:07:31.120
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:35.747
MATT: And yeah, reverting back to your form, the
party comes to an end. Uvenda comes up to you as

02:07:35.747 --> 02:07:40.002
you come back to your form and says, "I'm proud of
you."

02:07:40.002 --> 02:07:41.911
MARISHA: Thank you. Truly.

02:07:41.911 --> 02:07:47.163
MATT: "Now, return to your people victorious. You
achieved what your mother could not and her memory

02:07:47.163 --> 02:07:49.674
"lives on in you."

02:07:50.970 --> 02:07:52.264
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:07:52.851 --> 02:07:53.654
MATT: And she turns--

02:07:53.654 --> 02:07:58.871
MARISHA: I will keep her-- Thanks. That's all.

02:07:58.871 --> 02:08:05.259
MATT: "Good night." And she begins to walk off
with her staff. You guys are able to rest for the

02:08:05.259 --> 02:08:10.141
evening, prepare yourselves for the following
day's journey, however you wish that to be. So you

02:08:10.141 --> 02:08:20.664
get benefits of a long rest back. So you get half
of your hit dice back, you are healed to full, you

02:08:20.664 --> 02:08:24.126
get your spells, you're good.

02:08:31.567 --> 02:08:33.272
TRAVIS: That was such a great party.

02:08:33.666 --> 02:08:35.612
(all laugh)

02:08:35.612 --> 02:08:36.859
MARISHA: That was a good party.

02:08:36.859 --> 02:08:38.258
ASHLEY: Did you have so much fun, Grog?

02:08:38.258 --> 02:08:40.542
TRAVIS: Yeah, I rode the dragon all night.

02:08:40.542 --> 02:08:43.917
(all laugh)

02:08:43.917 --> 02:08:46.448
TRAVIS: It was great.

02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:55.666
MARISHA: That's true. I see Percy really quick.
Are you still concerned?

02:08:55.666 --> 02:08:57.641
TALIESIN: Yeah, well, yes.

02:08:57.641 --> 02:08:59.153
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:08:59.153 --> 02:09:00.272
TALIESIN: Congratulations.

02:09:00.272 --> 02:09:01.302
MARISHA: Wouldn't be you--

02:09:01.302 --> 02:09:02.076
TALIESIN: No.

02:09:02.076 --> 02:09:03.584
MARISHA: I--if you weren't concerned.

02:09:03.584 --> 02:09:10.338
TALIESIN: No, and thank you for not being--
somebody has to be all right. I mean, I'm fine,

02:09:10.398 --> 02:09:12.358
I'm fine.

02:09:12.358 --> 02:09:16.430
MARISHA: Wouldn't be here without you, or the
others. You know that, right?

02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:17.590
TALIESIN: I do.

02:09:17.590 --> 02:09:26.897
MARISHA: I can't do this alone and I-- To answer
your question from yesterday, I think the problem

02:09:26.897 --> 02:09:34.512
of this Aramente is that it shows you the
components of what you need to be a leader, but

02:09:34.512 --> 02:09:47.317
being a leader could take a lifetime to master. If
you even can master such a thing. So lots still to

02:09:47.317 --> 02:09:49.196
go, this isn't the end.

02:09:49.196 --> 02:09:50.090
TALIESIN: I know.

02:09:50.090 --> 02:09:51.159
MARISHA: And I hope you stay with me.

02:09:51.159 --> 02:09:53.011
TALIESIN: I will, to the end.

02:09:53.011 --> 02:09:54.062
MARISHA: I need you.

02:09:56.432 --> 02:09:59.275
TALIESIN: I need you, too.

02:09:59.339 --> 02:10:01.668
But we're not all going to make it.

02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:08.977
MARISHA: Well, let's at least go home for now. Is
that okay? Is that enough for now?

02:10:08.977 --> 02:10:17.471
TALIESIN: It certainly is. I am happy to try. But
things are only going to get more complicated.

02:10:18.619 --> 02:10:21.009
Congratulations. That's very impressive.

02:10:21.009 --> 02:10:26.455
MARISHA: I feel like once you can turn into a
dragon, things only get more complicated.

02:10:26.455 --> 02:10:28.602
TALIESIN: (laughs)

02:10:28.602 --> 02:10:29.639
MARISHA: That's, yeah.

02:10:29.639 --> 02:10:32.456
TALIESIN: I will thankfully never know.

02:10:32.456 --> 02:10:34.269
MARISHA: All right, let's go.

02:10:34.651 --> 02:10:43.168
LIAM: After she left our room to go find him, I
start to suit up, and I'm looking in a full-length

02:10:43.168 --> 02:10:52.957
mirror at the new fucking kraken beak gouges down
the front of me. And I notice that my two notes

02:10:53.005 --> 02:11:01.673
are out of place. So I'm going to shove them back
into the folds that they're supposed to be in. And

02:11:01.673 --> 02:11:05.767
spend a couple minutes to button all the way up
and leave the room.

02:11:05.767 --> 02:11:07.804
MATT: Okay.

02:11:11.373 --> 02:11:14.059
TRAVIS: Can I find Tary?

02:11:14.059 --> 02:11:15.896
MATT: Yeah.

02:11:15.896 --> 02:11:17.978
SAM: Oh, good morning.

02:11:17.978 --> 02:11:20.918
TRAVIS: No, it's like real late, right?

02:11:20.918 --> 02:11:22.124
SAM: I don't know. Is it?

02:11:22.124 --> 02:11:23.040
MATT: You haven't quite gone to bed yet.

02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:23.730
SAM: Oh!

02:11:23.730 --> 02:11:24.472
MATT: It's late evening.

02:11:24.472 --> 02:11:25.315
SAM: Good evening!

02:11:25.315 --> 02:11:27.147
TRAVIS: Jesus, that fight knocked you goofy,
didn't it?

02:11:27.147 --> 02:11:34.687
SAM: I have not been that close to death ever
before. But I feel like in a way I learned

02:11:34.687 --> 02:11:37.417
something from the experience.

02:11:37.417 --> 02:11:38.642
TRAVIS: What?

02:11:40.597 --> 02:11:52.744
(all laugh)

02:11:52.744 --> 02:11:54.515
SAM: That's fair.

02:11:54.568 --> 02:11:59.816
(all laugh)

02:11:59.816 --> 02:12:01.882
SAM: Tell me, I saw you up there fighting.

02:12:01.882 --> 02:12:02.790
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:05.160
SAM: You were brave and strong.

02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:07.731
TRAVIS: Yep. Yep.

02:12:07.731 --> 02:12:16.021
SAM: We were duking it out, you and me, 'til the
very end of that fight and well, as one seasoned

02:12:16.021 --> 02:12:17.231
warrior to another--

02:12:17.231 --> 02:12:18.780
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

02:12:18.780 --> 02:12:24.943
SAM: Do you have any tips? Any notes for me? Any
thoughts to improve my warfare skills? Should I

02:12:24.943 --> 02:12:31.833
move more? Should I think of cool one-liners to
yell out as I hit my enemies?

02:12:31.833 --> 02:12:36.632
TRAVIS: Ooh, yeah. That always helps. Right?
Someone like you, I would probably stay on the

02:12:36.632 --> 02:12:41.630
outside. You got a little in the crunch zone,
right? You seem to have

02:12:41.630 --> 02:12:43.791
a good range on your weapons.

02:12:43.791 --> 02:12:48.001
SAM: Well, yes, but my rod is best at close-up
action.

02:12:48.001 --> 02:12:53.577
TRAVIS: Most rods are good close-up but, you know,
if you could stay on the outside with it, maybe

02:12:53.577 --> 02:12:56.676
you'll have better success? But, I wanted to give
you something.

02:12:56.676 --> 02:12:57.579
SAM: Oh!

02:12:57.579 --> 02:13:02.479
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's like a last resort, right?
Cause you went like eee! And it was not good.

02:13:02.479 --> 02:13:03.477
SAM: No.

02:13:03.477 --> 02:13:09.124
TRAVIS:So I want to give you a magic egg. And I
reach into the bag of holding and I take out a

02:13:09.124 --> 02:13:14.353
basilisk egg that I have no fucking idea how old
it is. But, it's in there. There are six of them.

02:13:14.396 --> 02:13:15.869
MATT: It's old.

02:13:15.869 --> 02:13:21.010
TRAVIS: This egg is very, very special.

02:13:21.010 --> 02:13:22.361
SAM: Oh my god.

02:13:22.361 --> 02:13:31.017
MATT: It's about this big and the outside of it
has this very layered stone look to it. Almost

02:13:31.017 --> 02:13:37.169
like when plates shift and you watch old sediment
stone stick out. And you can see the different

02:13:37.169 --> 02:13:41.603
types of stone layers, geologically. It's that
kind of a texture down the side of it and it's

02:13:41.603 --> 02:13:44.928
like a dark gray, almost blue color.

02:13:44.928 --> 02:13:52.475
TRAVIS: This egg comes from a very ancient magical
beast. If you find yourself in a dire need. Like

02:13:52.475 --> 02:13:53.626
in that last fight.

02:13:53.626 --> 02:13:54.493
SAM: Yes. Yes.

02:13:54.493 --> 02:14:03.900
TRAVIS: If you break it and consume its contents,
you will be granted immense power.

02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:05.148
SAM: Really?

02:14:05.148 --> 02:14:11.933
TRAVIS: Indeed. But only in times of great need. I
trust I don't have to emphasize

02:14:11.933 --> 02:14:14.058
how important that is.

02:14:14.058 --> 02:14:15.718
MATT: Grog, make a deception check.

02:14:15.718 --> 02:14:19.055
TRAVIS: Shit! Come on big whammy.

02:14:19.055 --> 02:14:20.901
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you, Travis. However
this goes, I'm so proud of you.

02:14:20.901 --> 02:14:23.073
TRAVIS: Yes! 15.

02:14:23.073 --> 02:14:27.967
MATT: Make an insight check, Taryon.

02:14:27.967 --> 02:14:29.172
LIAM: You're not Scanlan.

02:14:29.172 --> 02:14:30.167
SAM: Eight.

02:14:30.167 --> 02:14:34.016
(all laugh)

02:14:34.016 --> 02:14:36.774
TRAVIS: I out-rolled somebody!

02:14:36.774 --> 02:14:38.922
LIAM: With your mind!

02:14:38.922 --> 02:14:40.427
TALIESIN: You used your mind.

02:14:40.427 --> 02:14:42.824
MATT: This is a mighty gift.

02:14:42.824 --> 02:14:48.843
SAM: Adding it to my list. Basilisk-- wait, I
don't know what it is. It's just an egg.

02:14:48.843 --> 02:14:49.958
A magical egg.

02:14:49.958 --> 02:14:53.003
MATT: A magical egg of power. To be consumed.

02:14:53.003 --> 02:14:54.270
MARISHA: It's like a Kinder Egg. There's a toy
inside.

02:14:54.270 --> 02:14:55.434
MATT: Kind of. Yeah.

02:14:55.434 --> 02:14:57.572
LIAM: Except it's full of sulfurous shit.

02:14:57.572 --> 02:15:00.686
TRAVIS: That shit is rank.

02:15:00.686 --> 02:15:04.266
LAURA: I imagine that I've been introducing Pike
to the whole crew.

02:15:04.266 --> 02:15:06.361
Since you like to sail so much.

02:15:06.361 --> 02:15:07.851
ASHLEY: Yeah. Hey, crew.

02:15:07.851 --> 02:15:09.422
SAM: Thank you.

02:15:09.422 --> 02:15:11.179
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

02:15:11.179 --> 02:15:12.301
MATT: Okay.

02:15:12.301 --> 02:15:15.674
ASHLEY: Is Doty, Dottie, his robot around?

02:15:15.674 --> 02:15:16.996
LAURA: Doodie.

02:15:16.996 --> 02:15:21.027
MATT: The robot stays with him when he is told
otherwise not to. So, it's hanging with him. When

02:15:21.027 --> 02:15:28.485
you're introduced to the crew, they're all your
ilk. They're all salty, sarcastic folk. Captain

02:15:28.485 --> 02:15:36.455
Adella and you could-- they're all taken aback by
your strangely-not-really-physically-there form.

02:15:36.455 --> 02:15:43.209
But, after a bit of trading some tales about a few
interesting at-sea endeavors, you guys get along

02:15:43.209 --> 02:15:49.816
swimmingly and it's a fast friendship between you
and Captain Adella.

02:15:49.816 --> 02:15:50.748
ASHLEY: Fantastic.

02:15:50.748 --> 02:15:51.759
LAURA: She's fucking cool.

02:15:51.759 --> 02:15:52.966
ASHLEY: She seems rad.

02:15:52.966 --> 02:15:53.863
LAURA: Yeah.

02:15:53.863 --> 02:15:55.472
MATT: So, what're you doing?

02:15:55.472 --> 02:16:00.630
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to go over to Tary.

02:16:00.630 --> 02:16:05.274
MATT: Okay. Taryon, after you're granted this
majestic egg, as you're walking back to your

02:16:05.274 --> 02:16:08.934
homestead, the glowing gnome approaches you.

02:16:08.934 --> 02:16:09.868
SAM: Oh! Hello.

02:16:09.868 --> 02:16:21.474
ASHLEY: Hello again. I have a request of your
robot. Your Doty. Am I saying this right?

02:16:21.474 --> 02:16:23.584
SAM: My personal manservant.

02:16:23.584 --> 02:16:25.110
ASHLEY: Your personal manservant.

02:16:25.110 --> 02:16:26.175
SAM: Yes.

02:16:26.175 --> 02:16:30.575
ASHLEY: Could he draw some things for me?

02:16:30.575 --> 02:16:38.364
SAM: In Gnome, I say, absolutely m'lady. Whatever
you would request.

02:16:39.165 --> 02:16:40.359
MATT: You are a m'lady.

02:16:40.359 --> 02:16:43.610
MARISHA: We totally called it.

02:16:45.083 --> 02:16:47.003
MATT: Continue.

02:16:47.003 --> 02:16:54.428
ASHLEY: And in Common, I say back, thank you so
much. Doty,

02:16:54.492 --> 02:17:02.899
would you mind drawing portraits for me?

02:17:04.071 --> 02:17:06.589
MATT: Looks back to you, Taryon.

02:17:06.589 --> 02:17:11.280
SAM: Do whatever the young lady asks.

02:17:11.683 --> 02:17:13.344
MATT: Pulls the book out.

02:17:13.344 --> 02:17:23.482
ASHLEY: Could you draw some portraits of this
group? Of Grog. Of Vax and Vex.

02:17:23.482 --> 02:17:25.764
Keyleth and Percy.

02:17:25.764 --> 02:17:30.514
SAM: Just a little bit of a note, here. He doesn't
know who any of those people are.

02:17:30.514 --> 02:17:35.842
ASHLEY: Okay. So the people that I point to. Could
you just draw each of them please?

02:17:35.842 --> 02:17:38.993
MATT: Everyone's kind of scattered to the four
winds right now.

02:17:38.993 --> 02:17:40.199
ASHLEY: Shit.

02:17:40.199 --> 02:17:41.209
LAURA: I'm there.

02:17:41.209 --> 02:17:42.484
SAM: I'll help you point them out to Doty.

02:17:42.484 --> 02:17:43.644
MATT: Yeah, Vex is there.

02:17:43.644 --> 02:17:44.465
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:17:44.465 --> 02:17:46.020
MATT: Yeah, you point out to where they're all
staying and--

02:17:46.020 --> 02:17:47.949
MARISHA: We're gathering up anyway. We're walking
over.

02:17:47.949 --> 02:17:54.658
ASHLEY: When you're all done, just bring them to
me. Thank you so much.

02:17:54.658 --> 02:17:57.496
SAM: Is there any particular style you'd like them
to be drawn in?

02:17:57.496 --> 02:17:59.256
ASHLEY: Just as realistic as possible.

02:17:59.256 --> 02:18:00.515
SAM: Realism. All right.

02:18:00.515 --> 02:18:01.497
ASHLEY: Realism.

02:18:01.497 --> 02:18:05.725
MATT: All right.

02:18:05.725 --> 02:18:10.634
ASHLEY: And I say, thank you, in Gnomish. In
Gnome.

02:18:10.634 --> 02:18:12.833
SAM: I say, you're warcome in Gnome.

02:18:12.833 --> 02:18:19.480
(all laugh)

02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:21.097
TALIESIN: I've been waiting for it.

02:18:21.097 --> 02:18:22.561
ASHLEY: Okay. That's all.

02:18:22.561 --> 02:18:33.742
MATT: All right. So as you all go to rest for the
evening, Pike, the granted presence here through

02:18:33.742 --> 02:18:40.369
Sarenrae's will begins to withdraw. Her strength
through the divine gate to keep you in this,

02:18:40.369 --> 02:18:45.785
seemingly drained. You sense that you'll be
returning back to Emon until you're retrieved by

02:18:45.785 --> 02:18:48.107
your allies here.

02:18:48.265 --> 02:18:49.574
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:18:49.574 --> 02:18:56.398
MATT: So, you'll only have a short time. As the
rest of you guys go to rest for the evening and

02:18:56.398 --> 02:19:04.361
you all go to sleep, Percy, Keyleth, Vax, Vex, and
Grog, I need you guys to roll perception checks.

02:19:06.725 --> 02:19:07.870
TRAVIS: I got this.

02:19:07.870 --> 02:19:09.522
SAM: I'm just doing this all night.

02:19:09.522 --> 02:19:10.768
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil.

02:19:10.768 --> 02:19:12.892
TRAVIS: Are we going Gil? Yeah. Don't fuck me,
Gil.

02:19:12.892 --> 02:19:14.160
MARISHA: That's not bad.

02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:15.651
SAM: You got to try Gil.

02:19:15.651 --> 02:19:16.876
TALIESIN: No! I'm going with that one.

02:19:16.876 --> 02:19:17.965
SAM: I'm negating that. Roll Gil.

02:19:17.965 --> 02:19:18.884
TALIESIN: You don't get to negate that one.

02:19:18.884 --> 02:19:20.030
SAM: I'm negating it. Roll Gil.

02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.858
TRAVIS: 19.

02:19:20.858 --> 02:19:21.571
MATT: Oh!

02:19:21.571 --> 02:19:22.381
TRAVIS: A natural 19.

02:19:22.381 --> 02:19:23.238
LAURA: 29.

02:19:23.238 --> 02:19:24.222
TALIESIN: No I'm going with my first one. You
don't get to negate my roll.

02:19:24.222 --> 02:19:25.273
LIAM: 22.

02:19:25.273 --> 02:19:26.232
SAM: He rolled a three.

02:19:26.232 --> 02:19:26.985
MARISHA: 23.

02:19:26.985 --> 02:19:27.742
TALIESIN: I did not roll--

02:19:27.742 --> 02:19:28.450
MATT: Wow!

02:19:28.450 --> 02:19:29.703
TALIESIN: I'm going with my first roll because
he's a jerk.

02:19:29.703 --> 02:19:31.425
MATT: All right. What was the first one?

02:19:31.425 --> 02:19:34.379
TALIESIN: 27. Jerk.

02:19:34.379 --> 02:19:36.264
MATT: Okay.

02:19:36.264 --> 02:19:38.528
SAM: Your friends all rolled with Gil.

02:19:38.528 --> 02:19:40.249
MATT: Throughout the evening--

02:19:40.249 --> 02:19:41.953
MARISHA: Rolling with Gil.

02:19:41.953 --> 02:19:48.896
MATT: At some point in the night, each of you
individually wakes up in the wee hours as a sound

02:19:48.896 --> 02:19:54.210
rouses you from your slumber as you glance over in
one of the nearby open windowed walls. You see a

02:19:54.210 --> 02:20:00.277
large, metallic man-shape appear. And just start
feverishly sketching while staring at you.

02:20:00.277 --> 02:20:03.032
(all laugh)

02:20:03.032 --> 02:20:06.650
MATT: One, by one, by one, by one.

02:20:06.650 --> 02:20:08.781
LAURA: As our faces are like--

02:20:08.781 --> 02:20:11.592
SAM: He likes to watch.

02:20:11.592 --> 02:20:14.939
LIAM: That was Tary's fucking automaton.

02:20:14.939 --> 02:20:17.034
MARISHA: I'm not dreaming. I'm not dreaming.

02:20:17.034 --> 02:20:18.270
TALIESIN: Okay, yeah.

02:20:18.270 --> 02:20:19.766
TRAVIS: Does anyone try to talk to the automaton?

02:20:19.766 --> 02:20:20.976
MARISHA: Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez.

02:20:20.976 --> 02:20:22.750
TALIESIN: I think we'd just stay perfectly still?

02:20:22.750 --> 02:20:23.508
LAURA: Yeah.

02:20:23.508 --> 02:20:24.646
(all laugh)

02:20:24.646 --> 02:20:27.119
TALIESIN: And try and lift our chin and push
forward.

02:20:27.119 --> 02:20:30.473
LAURA: 'Til it looks like a good angle, at least.

02:20:30.473 --> 02:20:32.877
LIAM: I slowly pull the sheet up--

02:20:32.877 --> 02:20:34.865
MARISHA: Yeah, higher, yeah.

02:20:34.865 --> 02:20:37.187
TRAVIS: I pull the sheet a little lower.

02:20:37.187 --> 02:20:44.771
(all laugh)

02:20:44.771 --> 02:20:49.895
MATT: And Doty continues sketching, adjusting to
the new positions.

02:20:49.895 --> 02:20:53.646
LIAM: Moves an adjacent piece of paper next to it
and keeps going.

02:20:53.646 --> 02:20:58.880
MATT: Keeps taping them on. All right.

02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:00.643
ASHLEY: Is he done?

02:21:00.643 --> 02:21:03.402
MATT: I will say--

02:21:03.402 --> 02:21:06.226
ASHLEY: I'm just afraid I'm gonna (whoosh).

02:21:06.226 --> 02:21:09.750
MATT: I will say, for the sake of narrative of
this, the energy will carry

02:21:09.750 --> 02:21:11.291
you through to the morning.

02:21:11.291 --> 02:21:11.922
SAM: Yes.

02:21:11.922 --> 02:21:12.846
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:21:12.846 --> 02:21:18.199
MATT: So, upon everyone waking, and gathering
again before heading however way you wish, the

02:21:18.199 --> 02:21:27.522
crew is by their boats to return to the ship,
Uvenda is waiting to see you off, and, as you all

02:21:27.522 --> 02:21:32.645
begin to gather, you watch Pike as she approaches,
her form flickering in the familiar visual of a

02:21:32.645 --> 02:21:37.080
temporary time before she has to return--

02:21:37.080 --> 02:21:37.921
LAURA: Oh no!

02:21:37.921 --> 02:21:38.906
ASHLEY: It's okay.

02:21:38.906 --> 02:21:43.976
MATT: As you approach to speak to everybody,
suddenly (grinding robot movement) from the side,

02:21:43.976 --> 02:21:46.248
Doty seems to just slam into view, like some weird
hype man.

02:21:46.248 --> 02:21:50.518
TRAVIS: A hype man! Yeah yeah!

02:21:50.518 --> 02:21:56.948
MATT: And immediately just hands you a metallic
fist filled with pages torn out of the tome.

02:21:57.994 --> 02:22:02.796
ASHLEY: Thank you so much.

02:22:02.796 --> 02:22:06.045
MATT: And then runs off towards Taryon.

02:22:07.004 --> 02:22:11.461
ASHLEY: Tary. Come here.

02:22:11.461 --> 02:22:12.526
SAM: Who, me?

02:22:12.526 --> 02:22:13.558
ASHLEY: Yes, you.

02:22:13.558 --> 02:22:14.789
TALIESIN: Couldn't be.

02:22:14.789 --> 02:22:16.358
SAM: Hello.

02:22:16.358 --> 02:22:26.366
ASHLEY: Hello. So, I figured you would have a
little bit of an easier time if you know the names

02:22:26.366 --> 02:22:35.887
of the people that you're spending time with. I
had him make you some, I don't know, maybe some

02:22:35.887 --> 02:22:44.736
flash cards. So, I take out a quill. I hold up a
photo. Who is this?

02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:54.001
MATT: What you see before you, is a very
beautifully realistically drawn image of a female

02:22:54.061 --> 02:23:01.281
half-elven druid, and a male half-elven rogue
paladin, both clutching bed-sheets, going--

02:23:01.281 --> 02:23:12.675
(all laugh)

02:23:12.675 --> 02:23:16.029
SAM: That's amazing. In the same drawing?

02:23:16.029 --> 02:23:18.233
MATT: Yeah.

02:23:18.233 --> 02:23:30.667
SAM: Oh! But how did-- I mean, they would have had
to have been--

02:23:30.667 --> 02:23:37.466
ASHLEY: I didn't realize he was going to draw them
in their sleep. So, let's just--

02:23:37.466 --> 02:23:42.174
LIAM: Please, go through every picture, please!

02:23:42.174 --> 02:23:47.470
SAM: Oh. I-- so many more questions than answers.

02:23:47.470 --> 02:23:53.658
(all laugh)

02:23:53.658 --> 02:23:56.288
MARISHA: It hurts!

02:23:56.288 --> 02:24:05.959
SAM: One of those two was dead yesterday, and yet
they still found time to-- well. The one on the

02:24:05.959 --> 02:24:13.361
left, I lovingly refer to her as Antlers. She is
the most powerful and leader of the group.

02:24:14.674 --> 02:24:23.327
ASHLEY: All those things are true, but take this
quill. Now, next to her picture,

02:24:23.327 --> 02:24:26.062
please write 'Keyleth'.

02:24:26.062 --> 02:24:27.488
SAM: Doty? You heard her.

02:24:27.488 --> 02:24:30.976
ASHLEY: No! No. No, no. No.

02:24:30.976 --> 02:24:33.813
MATT: Doty stops when she says no.

02:24:33.813 --> 02:24:36.108
ASHLEY: You are going to write it down.

02:24:36.108 --> 02:24:37.005
TRAVIS: Mama Pike!

02:24:37.005 --> 02:24:37.915
ASHLEY: Do you know how to write?

02:24:37.915 --> 02:24:38.813
MARISHA: Mama Pike.

02:24:38.813 --> 02:24:40.434
SAM: Of course I know how to write. I'm an
educated man.

02:24:40.434 --> 02:24:41.696
ASHLEY: Okay, I would--

02:24:41.696 --> 02:24:43.068
TRAVIS: Oh god, how does he know how to write?

02:24:43.068 --> 02:24:43.798
LAURA: (gasps)

02:24:43.798 --> 02:24:45.622
SAM: In what language?

02:24:45.622 --> 02:24:48.756
ASHLEY: What language do you prefer?

02:24:48.756 --> 02:24:51.540
SAM: I prefer Gnome when I'm with you.

02:24:51.540 --> 02:24:52.677
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:24:52.677 --> 02:24:54.086
LIAM: Old habits die hard.

02:24:54.086 --> 02:24:55.540
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah!

02:24:55.540 --> 02:24:58.563
SAM: It's good practice.

02:24:58.563 --> 02:24:59.927
TRAVIS: Little bleed-through.

02:24:59.927 --> 02:25:05.419
ASHLEY: Okay. So write down 'Keyleth.'

02:25:05.419 --> 02:25:13.775
SAM: Odd vowel sounds in your weird language.
Okay! Key-leth.

02:25:13.775 --> 02:25:16.160
ASHLEY: The man laying next to her--

02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:17.339
SAM: Mm-hm?

02:25:17.339 --> 02:25:19.441
ASHLEY: Do you know his name?

02:25:19.441 --> 02:25:22.436
SAM: Little Elf Boy.

02:25:22.436 --> 02:25:30.140
ASHLEY: I would never say that again. His name is
Vax.

02:25:30.140 --> 02:25:32.252
SAM: With a 'B'? Like Bax?

02:25:32.252 --> 02:25:36.661
ASHLEY: With a 'V', as in--

02:25:36.661 --> 02:25:37.650
SAM: Vagina?

02:25:37.650 --> 02:25:38.599
ASHLEY: Vagina.

02:25:38.599 --> 02:25:41.496
(all laugh)

02:25:41.496 --> 02:25:44.336
TALIESIN: Manna from heaven. Manna from heaven.

02:25:44.336 --> 02:25:45.438
SAM: Got it.

02:25:45.438 --> 02:25:47.037
LAURA: Oh god.

02:25:47.037 --> 02:25:49.184
SAM: 'X'. All right.

02:25:49.184 --> 02:25:50.072
ASHLEY: Next up.

02:25:50.072 --> 02:25:53.465
SAM: You know what, that one sounds familiar, I
feel like he's introduced himself to me.

02:25:53.465 --> 02:25:55.547
ASHLEY: Okay. Next up, who's this?

02:25:55.547 --> 02:26:01.120
MATT: This is another pair. (laughs) This one--

02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:02.378
TRAVIS: I'm so happy.

02:26:02.378 --> 02:26:12.017
MATT: --less shy. It appears to be a human male,
looking confused, with glasses pressed up above

02:26:12.017 --> 02:26:18.475
the top of the forehead, and a half-elven,
dark-haired, female, on top--

02:26:18.475 --> 02:26:19.872
LAURA: (laughs)

02:26:19.872 --> 02:26:23.516
MATT: -- glancing back with a 'don't you fucking
dare' expression.

02:26:23.516 --> 02:26:24.497
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:26:24.497 --> 02:26:26.222
(all laugh)

02:26:26.222 --> 02:26:30.106
SAM: Oh! Oh, well. I--

02:26:30.106 --> 02:26:32.193
ASHLEY: Yes, I know, you're learning so much.

02:26:32.193 --> 02:26:33.584
SAM: May I, for a moment?

02:26:33.584 --> 02:26:36.226
ASHLEY: Sure!

02:26:36.226 --> 02:26:40.992
SAM: Do you think this is up? Or--

02:26:40.992 --> 02:26:43.267
ASHLEY: You could have it any way you like it.

02:26:43.267 --> 02:26:45.476
(all laugh)

02:26:45.476 --> 02:26:46.656
LIAM: Oh my god.

02:26:46.656 --> 02:26:52.228
SAM: I've read about that. All right.

02:26:52.228 --> 02:26:56.930
ASHLEY: Just looking at the faces, then, who do
you think they are?

02:26:56.930 --> 02:27:00.421
SAM: The happy one is Little Elf Girl--

02:27:00.421 --> 02:27:04.750
ASHLEY: Ooh. I would definitely not ever say that
to her.

02:27:04.750 --> 02:27:10.058
SAM: All right. All right. What's her real name?

02:27:10.058 --> 02:27:13.329
ASHLEY: Her name is Vex.

02:27:13.329 --> 02:27:14.604
SAM: All right. Vex.

02:27:14.604 --> 02:27:18.815
ASHLEY: And you know that her and Vax are twin
brother and sister?

02:27:18.815 --> 02:27:20.233
SAM: I could tell by the bone structure--

02:27:20.233 --> 02:27:20.818
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:27:20.818 --> 02:27:21.983
SAM: -- and the contempt.

02:27:21.983 --> 02:27:26.223
(all laugh)

02:27:26.223 --> 02:27:28.770
TALIESIN: Oh! Oh.

02:27:28.770 --> 02:27:37.084
ASHLEY: Now. (laughs) The man laying next to her,
what is his name?

02:27:37.084 --> 02:27:40.443
SAM: Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Korrolo de
Rolo the third.

02:27:40.443 --> 02:27:42.546
(all laugh)

02:27:42.546 --> 02:27:43.271
TALIESIN: Well done!

02:27:43.271 --> 02:27:44.295
SAM: Almost! Almost!

02:27:44.295 --> 02:27:45.242
TRAVIS: Oh man!

02:27:45.242 --> 02:27:47.438
SAM: Almost! Almost! Klossowski de Rolo the
third!

02:27:47.438 --> 02:27:48.245
TALIESIN: Close enough!

02:27:48.245 --> 02:27:48.938
SAM: Percival--

02:27:48.938 --> 02:27:49.638
TALIESIN: Close enough!

02:27:49.638 --> 02:27:51.031
SAM: --Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel--

02:27:51.031 --> 02:27:52.766
TALIESIN: Muselix.

02:27:52.766 --> 02:27:53.917
MARISHA: (laughs) Von Muselix.

02:27:53.917 --> 02:27:55.348
SAM: Argh, so close!

02:27:55.348 --> 02:27:57.547
LIAM: You know what? The Klossowski, Klossowski--

02:27:57.547 --> 02:27:58.612
SAM: Klossowski de Rolo the third!

02:27:58.612 --> 02:27:59.482
TALIESIN: It's a little--

02:27:59.482 --> 02:28:00.295
LAURA: Gets ya every time.

02:28:00.295 --> 02:28:01.335
LIAM: That was bullshit. That was bullshit.

02:28:01.335 --> 02:28:02.490
TALIESIN: That all depends on how much whiskey.
That's fair.

02:28:02.490 --> 02:28:03.813
ASHLEY: Please write it down.

02:28:03.813 --> 02:28:06.133
TALIESIN: That's a whiskey-based pronunciation.

02:28:06.133 --> 02:28:07.762
SAM: That one I'm going to do in Common.

02:28:07.762 --> 02:28:13.434
(all laugh)

02:28:13.434 --> 02:28:16.234
SAM: And you know what? I'll just abbreviate the
middle part.

02:28:16.234 --> 02:28:17.399
TALIESIN: That's okay.

02:28:17.399 --> 02:28:20.433
SAM: P... de Rolo.

02:28:20.433 --> 02:28:21.676
LIAM: What's Percy's rapper name?

02:28:21.676 --> 02:28:25.985
ASHLEY: Great. Two more to go. Who's this?

02:28:25.985 --> 02:28:42.811
MATT: Well see, all right. This one is Pike, in
her gnomish form, still wearing her armor in her

02:28:42.811 --> 02:28:51.021
astral form, looking like she realized she didn't
phrase it properly when she made the request. And

02:28:51.021 --> 02:28:55.511
being the last one sketched, and that moment her
expression says, 'Oh no.'

02:28:55.511 --> 02:28:57.871
(all laugh)

02:28:57.871 --> 02:29:01.057
TRAVIS: Oh no.

02:29:01.057 --> 02:29:07.860
SAM: Before I answer, uh, (accented) answer--

02:29:07.860 --> 02:29:09.016
MARISHA: An-swer.

02:29:09.016 --> 02:29:12.000
SAM: -- just a quick process question, here.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:12.881
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:29:12.881 --> 02:29:22.282
SAM: In the other images, there was some revelry,
some intercourse happening. Is that-- now that I'm

02:29:22.282 --> 02:29:24.144
a full-fledged member, do I--

02:29:24.144 --> 02:29:26.706
(all laugh)

02:29:26.706 --> 02:29:32.191
SAM: Do I get to partake? Is this how it works
with everyone? Or is it just certain members--

02:29:32.191 --> 02:29:33.244
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

02:29:33.244 --> 02:29:35.900
SAM: Is it a hierarchy? Is it some sort of a--

02:29:35.900 --> 02:29:37.344
TRAVIS: Oh god.

02:29:37.344 --> 02:29:38.287
SAM: -- a cultish--

02:29:38.287 --> 02:29:39.393
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

02:29:39.393 --> 02:29:45.621
SAM: -- thing, where you have to prove yourself
sexually and in battle, or-- how does that work?

02:29:45.621 --> 02:29:46.950
TRAVIS: I can't even handle this.

02:29:46.950 --> 02:29:49.159
SAM: Or is it-- am I misreading this?

02:29:49.159 --> 02:29:58.614
ASHLEY: You know, I think you should just continue
to try to explore that.

02:29:58.614 --> 02:30:00.549
(all laugh)

02:30:00.549 --> 02:30:01.346
ASHLEY: Because--

02:30:01.346 --> 02:30:02.134
TRAVIS: Wow.

02:30:02.134 --> 02:30:04.584
ASHLEY: It would just be great just to see what
happens. You never know,

02:30:04.584 --> 02:30:07.386
Tary, you just never know.

02:30:07.386 --> 02:30:09.113
SAM: All right.

02:30:09.113 --> 02:30:10.861
ASHLEY: I would never tell you no.

02:30:10.861 --> 02:30:11.845
LAURA: (gasps)

02:30:11.845 --> 02:30:13.094
ASHLEY: No! Not me--

02:30:13.094 --> 02:30:15.760
(all laugh)

02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:23.488
ASHLEY: Let me rephrase. I would never tell you no
to not trying with the people of the group.

02:30:23.488 --> 02:30:26.676
SAM: So you're saying that membership has its
privileges?

02:30:26.676 --> 02:30:28.431
ASHLEY: Mayhaps.

02:30:28.431 --> 02:30:30.705
LAURA: Oh god.

02:30:30.705 --> 02:30:32.789
ASHLEY: Do you know my name?

02:30:32.789 --> 02:30:34.841
SAM: Daughter of Sarenrae, I'm guessing.

02:30:34.841 --> 02:30:36.979
ASHLEY: No. It's Pike.

02:30:36.979 --> 02:30:40.632
SAM: Hm. Pike.

02:30:40.632 --> 02:30:42.336
ASHLEY: And last, but certainly not least--

02:30:42.336 --> 02:30:43.921
MATT: Whoa.

02:30:43.921 --> 02:30:44.928
SAM: Oh boy.

02:30:44.928 --> 02:30:46.906
(all laugh)

02:30:46.906 --> 02:30:47.653
LIAM: Narrate it, Matt.

02:30:47.653 --> 02:30:49.374
SAM: Doty, she said realism.

02:30:49.374 --> 02:30:51.662
MATT: (creaks)

02:30:51.662 --> 02:30:52.655
SAM: Really?

02:30:52.655 --> 02:30:56.439
(all laugh)

02:30:56.439 --> 02:31:03.801
MATT: And there, in a classic Michelangelo-style
pose, one knee cocked to the side, the beard

02:31:03.801 --> 02:31:12.871
fluffed, the rippling scarred muscles, and the
obvious half-giant side of Grog Strongjaw before

02:31:12.934 --> 02:31:14.320
you on the page.

02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:17.089
LIAM: That is not a picture of a goliath and a
halfling, by the way.

02:31:18.195 --> 02:31:21.930
SAM: I mean, how does he walk?

02:31:21.984 --> 02:31:24.796
TALIESIN: With confidence and pride.

02:31:24.796 --> 02:31:25.945
TRAVIS: Pick a leg.

02:31:25.945 --> 02:31:26.862
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:31:26.862 --> 02:31:31.785
SAM: Wow. Wow.

02:31:31.785 --> 02:31:33.327
ASHLEY: I know.

02:31:33.327 --> 02:31:37.110
SAM: That is just-- that is primal.

02:31:37.110 --> 02:31:40.515
ASHLEY: He took some artistic liberties with this
one.

02:31:40.515 --> 02:31:41.485
SAM: Huh.

02:31:41.485 --> 02:31:42.193
LAURA: Ho ho ho!

02:31:42.193 --> 02:31:43.363
LIAM: Made it smaller.

02:31:43.363 --> 02:31:47.353
SAM: All right. I've been taking to calling him
Jumbo, or the Big Guy.

02:31:47.353 --> 02:31:48.433
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:31:48.433 --> 02:31:50.465
SAM: And it seems that I was correct.

02:31:50.465 --> 02:31:54.567
(all laugh)

02:31:54.567 --> 02:31:55.329
ASHLEY: Well, this--

02:31:55.329 --> 02:31:56.419
MATT: This joke went too far.

02:31:56.419 --> 02:31:57.546
ASHLEY: -- this is Grog.

02:31:57.546 --> 02:31:59.813
SAM: Say that again?

02:31:59.813 --> 02:32:00.883
ASHLEY: Grog.

02:32:00.883 --> 02:32:02.500
SAM: Grog. Okay.

02:32:02.500 --> 02:32:06.503
ASHLEY: And that is my very best friend.

02:32:06.503 --> 02:32:11.472
SAM: You know, I have learned that he is a
confident ally, and a friend to me as well. And I

02:32:11.472 --> 02:32:15.487
will do my best to protect him in battle in your
absence.

02:32:15.487 --> 02:32:25.591
ASHLEY: Well (laughs) thank you. That is very,
very kind of you. So, before I leave, my request

02:32:25.591 --> 02:32:33.835
is that you look at these every night before bed
until you learn them.

02:32:33.835 --> 02:32:34.830
TRAVIS: I love it so much.

02:32:34.830 --> 02:32:36.028
LIAM: Love Mama Pike.

02:32:36.028 --> 02:32:41.100
SAM: Can you-- in this form, can you see me all
the time?

02:32:43.881 --> 02:32:45.070
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:32:47.454 --> 02:32:48.606
SAM: I will.

02:32:48.606 --> 02:32:53.211
ASHLEY: So I will know if you're not looking at
your flashcards every night.

02:32:53.211 --> 02:32:58.234
(all laugh)

02:32:58.234 --> 02:32:59.894
ASHLEY: This is so stupid.

02:32:59.894 --> 02:33:01.296
LIAM: This is Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, man!

02:33:01.296 --> 02:33:02.360
TALIESIN: This is amazing.

02:33:02.360 --> 02:33:06.343
LIAM: This is Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons!

02:33:06.343 --> 02:33:12.710
SAM: Milady, I swear it by my name, I will do so
as you request. Thank you for saving one of my

02:33:12.710 --> 02:33:19.610
allies today, and wherever you are in the world,
know that we are fighting the good fight, and I

02:33:19.610 --> 02:33:25.689
will keep your friends safe. Your friends, Greg--

02:33:25.689 --> 02:33:26.805
ASHLEY: Nope.

02:33:26.805 --> 02:33:30.759
SAM: -- Vox, Vox, Kiko--

02:33:30.759 --> 02:33:32.708
TALIESIN: Kiko works.

02:33:32.708 --> 02:33:37.391
SAM: -- and Percival Frederickstein Von Musel--

02:33:37.391 --> 02:33:38.019
TALIESIN: Let it roll.

02:33:38.019 --> 02:33:40.480
SAM: -- Klossowski De Rolo the third.

02:33:40.534 --> 02:33:41.446
TALIESIN: That's pretty good.

02:33:41.446 --> 02:33:42.607
(all cheer)

02:33:42.607 --> 02:33:43.383
SAM: Ah.

02:33:43.383 --> 02:33:45.985
ASHLEY: I realise that was off of memory, so I'm
gonna let it slide, but yes.

02:33:45.985 --> 02:33:47.615
SAM: I have a few more nights of studying to do.

02:33:47.615 --> 02:33:54.408
ASHLEY: You do. Okay. It was wonderful to spend
time with you. I'm gonna just--

02:33:54.408 --> 02:33:57.311
I'm gonna go back over here.

02:33:57.311 --> 02:33:58.233
SAM: All right.

02:33:58.233 --> 02:33:58.977
ASHLEY: Goodbye.

02:33:58.977 --> 02:34:00.202
SAM: Serf trervles.

02:34:00.202 --> 02:34:01.796
(all laugh)

02:34:01.796 --> 02:34:02.948
MARISHA and TALIESIN: (laugh) Serf trervles.

02:34:02.948 --> 02:34:03.885
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

02:34:03.885 --> 02:34:06.451
MATT: I did not expect it to go that far.

02:34:06.451 --> 02:34:07.507
SAM: (laughs)

02:34:07.507 --> 02:34:08.261
TRAVIS: My fucking--

02:34:08.261 --> 02:34:08.833
TALIESIN: Wow.

02:34:08.833 --> 02:34:09.714
TRAVIS: -- my ears hurt.

02:34:09.714 --> 02:34:12.627
LIAM: I have a fresh new set of six-pack abs after
the last ten minutes.

02:34:12.627 --> 02:34:14.258
MATT: Seriously.

02:34:14.258 --> 02:34:16.360
SAM: We gotta get Ashley back. We gotta bring her
back.

02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:17.595
MATT: All right, so as you guys get over--

02:34:17.595 --> 02:34:19.943
SAM: We gotta get Ashley back.

02:34:19.943 --> 02:34:21.767
ASHLEY: Sorry, that went a little bit longer than
I thought.

02:34:21.767 --> 02:34:22.572
MATT: No! No!

02:34:22.572 --> 02:34:24.089
TALIESIN: It was so good!

02:34:24.089 --> 02:34:25.250
MATT: You know--

02:34:25.250 --> 02:34:26.258
LAURA: That was awesome.

02:34:26.258 --> 02:34:34.923
MATT: In Doty being literal, it lead to all of
that joy. Holy shit. So. As you guys all gather on

02:34:34.988 --> 02:34:40.974
the beaches in the late morning of Vesrah, Adella
and her crew are waiting at the boats to return to

02:34:40.974 --> 02:34:47.934
the ship. And Uvenda and a few other folks there,
you see Durent, you see Yulan, the little boy that

02:34:47.934 --> 02:34:51.319
met you when you first got here, and a few of the
other folks that you met that evening, all

02:34:51.319 --> 02:35:00.795
waiting, and as you approach, Uvenda nods, and,
"It has been an absolute pleasure to have you, Vox

02:35:00.795 --> 02:35:08.398
"Machina, at the sides of Keyleth, to come and
spend time with our people, to celebrate the

02:35:08.398 --> 02:35:17.882
"completion of a difficult journey. I would request
before you leave, to please return the goggles and

02:35:17.882 --> 02:35:20.145
"neck pieces that we lent you."

02:35:20.145 --> 02:35:21.286
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:35:21.286 --> 02:35:22.979
LIAM: It's like an IMAX theater.

02:35:22.979 --> 02:35:29.582
MATT: Kind of. They go and collect the pieces from
you as you go on. "And best of luck in your future

02:35:29.634 --> 02:35:38.573
"journeys. If we, the Ashari of Vesrah, can be of
aid to you in the future, please let us know."

02:35:38.596 --> 02:35:43.459
MARISHA: Thank you for everything. I'm sure we'll
be in contact soon.

02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:44.997
MATT: Kaitiyaki.

02:35:44.997 --> 02:35:47.181
MARISHA: Kaitiyaki.

02:35:47.181 --> 02:35:51.881
MATT: And they turn around and start walking their
way back to the center of Vesrah. Some of the kids

02:35:51.881 --> 02:35:55.376
looking over their shoulders, kind of waiting to
see what you're going to do. Adella is waiting

02:35:55.376 --> 02:35:57.269
there at the ship,

02:35:57.269 --> 02:36:02.095
"All right, so, what's the plan?"

02:36:02.095 --> 02:36:07.890
MARISHA: I mean, I totally could Tree Stride us
anywhere, but I kind of want to take the boat

02:36:07.890 --> 02:36:08.983
again.

02:36:08.983 --> 02:36:10.972
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're getting all our
money's worth out of the boat.

02:36:10.972 --> 02:36:12.662
MARISHA: Yeah, we paid a lot, yeah.

02:36:12.662 --> 02:36:15.030
TRAVIS: What are we gonna do?

02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:16.089
MARISHA: To Emon for now?

02:36:16.089 --> 02:36:23.097
LIAM: Well, Hotis is going to come for Pickle and
I at some point, but we need to do a little more

02:36:23.097 --> 02:36:25.428
homework this time.

02:36:25.428 --> 02:36:30.279
LAURA: Where can we study? The Cobalt Reserve? Is
it still standing at all in Emon?

02:36:30.279 --> 02:36:31.524
Are there any books left?

02:36:31.524 --> 02:36:32.518
MARISHA: We can go see.

02:36:32.518 --> 02:36:33.473
LIAM: Gotta go to the liberry.

02:36:33.473 --> 02:36:34.335
LAURA: Yeah.

02:36:34.335 --> 02:36:38.270
MARISHA: We also haven't looked at any of the
findings from Raishan's cave.

02:36:38.270 --> 02:36:38.979
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

02:36:38.979 --> 02:36:39.855
TALIESIN: No, not yet.

02:36:39.855 --> 02:36:42.706
TRAVIS: Lots of books to read, real exciting.

02:36:42.706 --> 02:36:47.217
MARISHA: Well, let's at least get back to Emon,
that's the main port town.

02:36:47.217 --> 02:36:49.085
LAURA: Yeah.

02:36:49.085 --> 02:36:50.281
LIAM: It's a starting point.

02:36:50.281 --> 02:36:51.788
MARISHA: It's a starting point.

02:36:51.788 --> 02:36:56.171
TALIESIN: We can also have them start looking at
the books while we're away, telling us if they

02:36:56.171 --> 02:36:58.209
find anything of value.

02:36:58.209 --> 02:37:03.514
LAURA: That's true. Probably need to start
studying Orcus as well.

02:37:03.514 --> 02:37:05.235
TRAVIS: What?

02:37:05.235 --> 02:37:09.706
LIAM: Orcas, orcas, after all of that under-sea--

02:37:09.706 --> 02:37:10.996
LAURA: All those killer whales.

02:37:10.996 --> 02:37:13.843
LIAM: -- struggle we need to be up to par.

02:37:13.843 --> 02:37:15.869
TRAVIS: Ah, know our allies?

02:37:15.869 --> 02:37:23.602
TALIESIN: There'll be time on the ship. Let's take
our time, before the Orcas.

02:37:25.297 --> 02:37:30.483
MATT: All right. At this point Pike begins to
flicker.

02:37:30.483 --> 02:37:31.755
LAURA: No!

02:37:31.755 --> 02:37:33.560
ASHLEY: It's okay, I'll see you guys very soon.

02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:34.819
LIAM: Jello shot, where you going?

02:37:34.819 --> 02:37:35.630
LAURA: Back home?

02:37:35.630 --> 02:37:37.427
ASHLEY: Yeah, back home. Jello shot? (laughs)

02:37:37.427 --> 02:37:38.949
MARISHA: We're heading to Emon so we'll see you
there, okay?

02:37:38.949 --> 02:37:40.539
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll see you soon--

02:37:40.539 --> 02:37:41.525
TRAVIS: Wait, quick squeeze!

02:37:41.525 --> 02:37:43.231
ASHLEY: Quick squeeze!

02:37:43.231 --> 02:37:45.365
MATT: And she vanishes in your grasp.

02:37:45.365 --> 02:37:49.169
TRAVIS: Ah, no! Ahh!

02:37:49.169 --> 02:37:52.709
MARISHA: No, no, no, she's okay.

02:37:52.709 --> 02:37:53.645
SAM: No, no, no.

02:37:53.645 --> 02:37:54.809
LAURA: No, no, she's okay, she's fine.

02:37:54.809 --> 02:37:58.029
LIAM: Twin on each arm pulling.

02:37:58.029 --> 02:37:59.126
MATT: It's not enough.

02:37:59.126 --> 02:38:00.770
TALIESIN: It'll be fine, he's just going to make
himself pass out, it'll be just fine.

02:38:00.770 --> 02:38:01.732
MARISHA: True.

02:38:01.732 --> 02:38:03.524
LIAM: Percy, get over here and pull!

02:38:03.524 --> 02:38:05.606
TALIESIN: I want to see, let him sleep it off.

02:38:05.606 --> 02:38:07.223
MARISHA: Just let him sleep, let him sleep it
off.

02:38:07.223 --> 02:38:12.051
TRAVIS: (wails)

02:38:12.051 --> 02:38:16.215
MATT: You guys make your way onto the ship with
Captain Adella at the helm, the boat turns around,

02:38:16.215 --> 02:38:26.458
navigates the thin pathway between these exterior
reefs, and eventually to the open seas of Ozmit.

02:38:26.511 --> 02:38:32.534
MARISHA: I-- if you're interested, Adella, because
I'm feeling pretty spiffy after--

02:38:32.534 --> 02:38:37.882
MATT: She's holding onto the wheel like, "You
worry me already."

02:38:37.882 --> 02:38:45.485
MARISHA: Okay, all right, I can control the winds
and give us forwards-facing winds for a solid hour

02:38:45.485 --> 02:38:50.840
if you want. You want it? You want a little, turn
this into a speed boat? You know? See how fast it

02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:54.721
goes? I don't know what this means, I've just seen
other sailors do it so.

02:38:54.721 --> 02:39:00.672
TRAVIS: In a lot of countries it means one thing,
especially when sailors do it.

02:39:00.672 --> 02:39:04.234
MATT: "Be my guest."

02:39:04.234 --> 02:39:11.897
MARISHA: Okay, I cast fifth-level Control Winds.
I'm going to do just a solid gust behind us for a

02:39:11.897 --> 02:39:13.081
good hour.

02:39:13.081 --> 02:39:17.241
MATT: Okay, and with this consistently used, you
guys can cut about

02:39:17.241 --> 02:39:18.819
half of the travel time back to Emon.

02:39:18.819 --> 02:39:20.012
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:39:20.012 --> 02:39:23.589
MATT: So what would normally be, depending on
weather, like five, six, seven days,

02:39:23.589 --> 02:39:24.872
you get there in three.

02:39:24.872 --> 02:39:26.302
LAURA: Nice.

02:39:26.302 --> 02:39:29.910
MATT: Through the use of that, your general
Control Weather abilities and stuff-- it's pretty

02:39:29.910 --> 02:39:36.795
fantastic. Thinking in the back of your head as
you travel that while you've completed your

02:39:36.795 --> 02:39:42.821
Aramente, it is not done, you still have to return
to complete your Aramente. You guys eventually

02:39:42.821 --> 02:39:49.617
find your way, coming into the docks on the
western side of Emon, the city still in the throes

02:39:49.617 --> 02:39:56.369
of rebuilding, restructuring, it's busy, people
are returning, flocking to the streets. It's very

02:39:56.369 --> 02:40:05.463
warm and welcoming to come back to a city that is
coming to life again. Where the grim reality

02:40:05.463 --> 02:40:12.912
post-Thordak's fall has now been replaced with, it
seems to be a vibrant, buzzing energy of recovery

02:40:12.912 --> 02:40:20.028
and moving forward. This still is the central city
of Tal'Dorei, and the people who have returned to

02:40:20.028 --> 02:40:26.656
this are bringing it back as soon as they can to
the splendor it once held, being the jewel city of

02:40:26.656 --> 02:40:33.706
this continent. You guys, after docking Adella and
the crew, which I can't recall,

02:40:33.706 --> 02:40:35.314
did you pay them in advance?

02:40:35.314 --> 02:40:36.145
LAURA: Mm-hm.

02:40:36.145 --> 02:40:37.955
MATT: Great.

02:40:37.955 --> 02:40:41.265
LAURA: No, I'm sure I did, marked it down, so.

02:40:41.466 --> 02:40:42.524
MATT: I'm pretty sure you did.

02:40:42.524 --> 02:40:50.846
LAURA: Oh no, I didn't, because we had decided on
150 gold per day. So, we went back quicker than we

02:40:50.846 --> 02:40:54.703
thought so three days back, five days there?

02:40:54.703 --> 02:40:55.697
MATT: Mm-hm.

02:40:55.697 --> 02:40:57.385
LAURA: And then how many days were we in--

02:40:57.385 --> 02:40:59.375
MATT: Technically, two.

02:40:59.375 --> 02:41:00.311
TALIESIN: Two.

02:41:00.311 --> 02:41:01.630
MATT: One, two nights in Vesrah.

02:41:01.630 --> 02:41:06.950
LAURA: So ten? So just over 1,000 gold, that's
good.

02:41:06.950 --> 02:41:09.903
SAM: I'll take care of it.

02:41:09.903 --> 02:41:11.863
LAURA: Are you going to write her an IOU?

02:41:11.863 --> 02:41:15.349
SAM: No, I'll pay her in gold.

02:41:15.349 --> 02:41:17.154
LAURA: Taryon, really?

02:41:17.154 --> 02:41:21.664
SAM: I hired you all, it's only the right thing,
Vex.

02:41:21.664 --> 02:41:27.824
LAURA: Wow. Thank you, Taryon.

02:41:27.824 --> 02:41:30.162
SAM: I'm a man of my word.

02:41:30.162 --> 02:41:34.219
LAURA: I'm going to stand by your side as you pay
her.

02:41:34.219 --> 02:41:39.019
MATT: Captain Adella's there with her crew behind
her. "It's been an absolute pleasure. Should you

02:41:39.019 --> 02:41:42.170
"require our assistance again, you know where to
find us, and if not, we're busy making money

02:41:42.170 --> 02:41:44.479
"elsewhere, fuck off."

02:41:46.234 --> 02:41:48.121
SAM: 1,500?

02:41:49.871 --> 02:41:53.381
MATT: She takes the coin purse from you.

02:41:53.381 --> 02:41:55.601
SAM: Plus 150 tip.

02:41:55.601 --> 02:41:59.262
MATT: Takes that, hands it to one of her-- her
first mate--

02:41:59.262 --> 02:42:02.460
SAM: Plus 200 for any damages to your ship.

02:42:03.590 --> 02:42:09.341
MATT: "It was quite damaged." Passes it off to her
first mate again and you can see the first mate is

02:42:09.341 --> 02:42:13.019
kind of the sheepish mousy gentleman who is
currently in process of counting all the coins as

02:42:13.019 --> 02:42:20.574
they come in, he's, like, the on-board accountant
and he's just-- "We're good." "Wonderful. Thank

02:42:20.574 --> 02:42:28.752
"you so much for your patronage. Wish you all a
fond farewell. Now shoo."

02:42:29.835 --> 02:42:34.822
LAURA: Taryon, thank you.

02:42:34.822 --> 02:42:39.872
SAM: It's a pleasure doing business with you.

02:42:40.341 --> 02:42:42.312
LAURA: All right.

02:42:42.312 --> 02:42:47.024
MATT: You guys head into the city, and with each
street corner there's another building with a roof

02:42:47.024 --> 02:42:53.315
that's being re-roofed. You can see walls being
re-stoned and structured. You can see carts being

02:42:53.315 --> 02:42:59.175
brought in from the docks as trade has now begun
anew within the city, and there is a semblance of

02:42:59.175 --> 02:43:06.273
culture, life and society continuing to still
re-emerge and spread with each visit to the city,

02:43:06.273 --> 02:43:12.646
and it's very heartwarming and harkening to the
good that you've done through the struggles and

02:43:12.646 --> 02:43:15.353
challenges leading up to this time.

02:43:15.944 --> 02:43:21.422
LIAM: I'm sorry, old man, who's in charge here
these days?

02:43:21.422 --> 02:43:23.627
MATT: "In charge of what?"

02:43:23.627 --> 02:43:26.332
LIAM: The city? Who's running things?

02:43:26.332 --> 02:43:28.430
MATT: "Oh, the Council."

02:43:28.430 --> 02:43:30.273
LIAM: They're doing all right?

02:43:30.273 --> 02:43:31.710
MATT: "I think so?"

02:43:31.710 --> 02:43:35.190
LIAM: Okay, everything steady as she goes?

02:43:35.190 --> 02:43:39.183
MATT: "I mean, my house is in ruins and I haven't
seen my grandchildren but--"

02:43:39.183 --> 02:43:40.524
LAURA: Wow.

02:43:40.524 --> 02:43:42.529
SAM: (laughs) Jesus.

02:43:42.529 --> 02:43:45.143
TALIESIN: Well, that was English, well done.

02:43:49.834 --> 02:43:52.119
MATT: "Could I?"

02:43:52.170 --> 02:43:53.664
TALIESIN: That was the most English thing I've
ever seen in my life.

02:43:53.664 --> 02:43:56.535
LIAM: Sure thing, Grandfather.

02:43:56.535 --> 02:44:00.647
MATT: "Good day to you." Then he just wanders
off.

02:44:00.647 --> 02:44:11.533
LAURA: Can I just pull Keyleth aside as we come on
land? And just say, I was very impressed with you.

02:44:12.384 --> 02:44:24.518
For a long time, I've harbored a bit of doubt, I'm
sorry to say, and when you brought us away from

02:44:24.518 --> 02:44:40.445
the kraken, I was very angry and very fearful. But
you've proven yourself, so much,

02:44:40.445 --> 02:44:45.331
and I want to say I'm sorry.

02:44:49.240 --> 02:44:55.958
MARISHA: There's no need for an apology. Just, you
being there means everything.

02:44:55.958 --> 02:45:00.125
LAURA: I believe in you.

02:45:00.125 --> 02:45:09.525
MARISHA: That means a lot, coming from you,
because I think you're just the coolest. I'm sorry

02:45:09.525 --> 02:45:16.803
if I ever put you or your brother in harm's way.
Or anyone else.

02:45:16.803 --> 02:45:22.322
LAURA: We all did it willingly. He especially.

02:45:22.322 --> 02:45:34.132
MARISHA: Well. Thank you. What now?

02:45:34.132 --> 02:45:40.704
LAURA: Well, we still have some things to take
care of. We have a crown to get on your head. I

02:45:40.704 --> 02:45:43.531
can't believe you're going to be royalty.
Royalty-royalty.

02:45:43.531 --> 02:45:45.112
MARISHA: Royalty's a strong word.

02:45:45.112 --> 02:45:46.989
LAURA: Rule royalty. That's pretty fucking cool,
Keyleth.

02:45:46.989 --> 02:45:51.380
MARISHA: Well, you're pretty cool yourself.

02:45:51.380 --> 02:45:53.732
LAURA: Ah, well.

02:45:53.732 --> 02:45:58.912
MARISHA: All Grand Mistress Nightwatch. What's it
called? Whatever.

02:45:58.912 --> 02:46:00.183
TALIESIN: I'm not helping.

02:46:00.183 --> 02:46:02.631
(all laugh)

02:46:02.631 --> 02:46:12.018
LAURA: Keyleth. I'm glad my brother found you. I'm
glad we all found you.

02:46:12.018 --> 02:46:15.570
MARISHA: I'm glad I found you guys.

02:46:15.570 --> 02:46:17.995
LAURA: Love-love.

02:46:17.995 --> 02:46:24.238
MARISHA: Learned a lot from you, so thank you. She
winked at me again.

02:46:25.884 --> 02:46:33.250
MATT: As you guys make your way through the city
towards the temple district of Emon, you find your

02:46:33.250 --> 02:46:38.522
way to the temple of Sarenrae, and as you begin to
step on the outside, the door's already open, and

02:46:38.522 --> 02:46:42.303
knowingly awaiting, Pike steps out with a smile to
greet you.

02:46:42.379 --> 02:46:47.515
(all cheer)

02:46:47.515 --> 02:46:56.276
ASHLEY: It's okay! I just disappeared 'cause I was
in the shimmery. I was the cotton candy. You

02:46:56.276 --> 02:46:57.608
didn't hurt me at all.

02:46:57.608 --> 02:46:59.344
TRAVIS: I like cotton candy.

02:46:59.344 --> 02:47:00.426
ASHLEY: Yeah, but--

02:47:00.426 --> 02:47:02.563
(all laugh)

02:47:02.563 --> 02:47:08.645
ASHLEY: I shouldn't say-- I wasn't like that,
then.

02:47:08.645 --> 02:47:12.254
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. I'm sorry if I hurt you.

02:47:12.254 --> 02:47:13.745
ASHLEY: No, you didn't at all!

02:47:13.745 --> 02:47:15.364
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:47:15.364 --> 02:47:17.183
ASHLEY: I didn't even feel it.

02:47:17.183 --> 02:47:18.990
TRAVIS: Wow, you are really getting strong.

02:47:18.990 --> 02:47:19.970
ASHLEY: I just disappeared.

02:47:19.970 --> 02:47:21.837
TRAVIS: Yeah. You distappeared.

02:47:21.837 --> 02:47:24.863
(all laugh)

02:47:24.863 --> 02:47:26.679
ASHLEY: Hi, everybody!

02:47:26.679 --> 02:47:28.690
TALIESIN: Hand over a big pile of seashell
jewelry.

02:47:28.690 --> 02:47:30.000
ASHLEY: What is this?

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:31.634
TALIESIN: Now, there we are.

02:47:31.634 --> 02:47:32.589
MARISHA: Now you can wear it.

02:47:32.589 --> 02:47:37.335
ASHLEY: Oh, yes! Ooh.

02:47:37.386 --> 02:47:39.397
TALIESIN: It fits, good. I was a little worried.

02:47:39.449 --> 02:47:45.189
MARISHA: He spent the entire time on the boat
braiding macrame, it was crazy.

02:47:45.189 --> 02:47:47.932
TALIESIN: I've only got the medium glasses right
now, so--

02:47:47.932 --> 02:47:50.503
MARISHA: He's getting into beading, it's odd.

02:47:50.503 --> 02:47:54.259
(all laugh)

02:47:54.259 --> 02:47:55.813
ASHLEY: I give him a big hug.

02:47:55.813 --> 02:47:57.985
TALIESIN: Everybody needs a hobby.

02:47:57.985 --> 02:47:58.869
MARISHA: No, it's great.

02:47:58.869 --> 02:48:00.041
TALIESIN: Macrame might be mine.

02:48:00.041 --> 02:48:02.042
MATT: Pike runs up and gives you a big hug.

02:48:02.042 --> 02:48:03.005
LIAM: Stress relief.

02:48:03.005 --> 02:48:06.210
ASHLEY: I give him a big hug.

02:48:06.210 --> 02:48:08.149
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:48:08.149 --> 02:48:09.749
ASHLEY: Hello, Tary.

02:48:09.749 --> 02:48:17.797
SAM: Hello, Pike. In the flesh, this time. I hope
that you've seen that I've been

02:48:17.797 --> 02:48:20.977
doing as you asked every night.

02:48:22.892 --> 02:48:25.235
ASHLEY: Can I insight check him?

02:48:25.235 --> 02:48:26.821
MATT: Go for it.

02:48:26.821 --> 02:48:28.765
TALIESIN: Did we hear him say that?

02:48:28.765 --> 02:48:30.083
MATT: Under his breath, yeah.

02:48:30.083 --> 02:48:31.005
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:48:31.005 --> 02:48:32.818
LAURA: I know, right?

02:48:34.002 --> 02:48:36.164
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

02:48:36.164 --> 02:48:37.504
SAM: Absolutely.

02:48:37.504 --> 02:48:41.848
MATT: Yeah, telling the truth, straight up. There
is a look of genuine awe and fear in his eyes when

02:48:41.848 --> 02:48:44.296
he looks at you.

02:48:44.792 --> 02:48:50.005
ASHLEY: I'm very proud of you. You need to
continue until you know it by heart.

02:48:50.005 --> 02:48:54.223
SAM: I think I've learned their first names at
least.

02:48:54.223 --> 02:48:55.550
ASHLEY: I know.

02:48:55.550 --> 02:48:57.268
(all laugh)

02:48:57.268 --> 02:48:58.230
ASHLEY: You have.

02:48:58.230 --> 02:48:59.484
TRAVIS: (deep voice) I know.

02:48:59.484 --> 02:49:03.764
(all laugh)

02:49:03.764 --> 02:49:08.311
SAM: Well. What do we do now, fellows?

02:49:08.311 --> 02:49:09.797
MARISHA: To the keep?

02:49:09.797 --> 02:49:10.981
LIAM: Yeah, you wanna see where we live?

02:49:10.981 --> 02:49:12.738
LAURA: To the keep, we need to stop by the
library.

02:49:12.738 --> 02:49:14.104
SAM: Sure, yes, absolutely.

02:49:14.104 --> 02:49:15.594
LAURA: Yeah, let's go to Greyskull.

02:49:15.594 --> 02:49:17.673
TALIESIN: Give you a place to put down your things
for a bit.

02:49:17.673 --> 02:49:22.343
MARISHA: Do you have the papers with you that you
pulled from Raishan? Are those with us?

02:49:22.343 --> 02:49:24.394
MATT: They're in the bag of holding.

02:49:24.394 --> 02:49:25.544
MARISHA: I'll help you research those.

02:49:25.544 --> 02:49:27.060
TALIESIN: Yeah, we'll do a bit of that.

02:49:27.060 --> 02:49:28.238
MARISHA: All right.

02:49:28.238 --> 02:49:29.691
MATT: So you guys make your way back to Greyskull
Keep--

02:49:29.691 --> 02:49:32.068
TALIESIN: I'll show you the other workshop.

02:49:32.141 --> 02:49:34.114
SAM: (gasps) Ooh, there's something I need to
tinker.

02:49:34.114 --> 02:49:36.179
TALIESIN: Oh, good. I actually need to talk to you
about that.

02:49:36.179 --> 02:49:40.102
MATT: Much to your joy, some of your original
servants have returned from Whitestone.

02:49:40.102 --> 02:49:42.231
(all cheer)

02:49:42.231 --> 02:49:44.266
LAURA: Yay! Who all came back?

02:49:44.266 --> 02:49:47.521
MATT: You do see within there, Laina and Erwin--

02:49:47.521 --> 02:49:48.353
LIAM: Holy shit!

02:49:48.353 --> 02:49:51.254
LAURA: I was so worried about them!

02:49:51.254 --> 02:49:55.716
MATT: Laina greets you as you come up, she's like,
"Oh goodness me, it's been so long, all of you.

02:49:55.716 --> 02:50:00.218
"Well, come in, it's so good to see you. Well, as
you were wandering about, we were all just keeping

02:50:00.218 --> 02:50:06.491
"it down over there in Whitestone, but it's so nice
to be back. This place, it needs some work. Please

02:50:06.491 --> 02:50:10.380
"don't be judging, I'm trying to clean as best I
can!" And the place looks pretty good, based on

02:50:10.380 --> 02:50:13.562
the last time you saw it, but there's still dust
gathered around. She looks genuinely nervous, her

02:50:13.562 --> 02:50:15.392
hair's kind of wracked.

02:50:15.392 --> 02:50:17.136
LAURA: You're doing a great job.

02:50:17.136 --> 02:50:19.866
LIAM: We're all a bit of a work in progress, it's
fine, dear.

02:50:19.866 --> 02:50:20.837
LAURA: Yeah.

02:50:20.837 --> 02:50:22.492
TALIESIN: That's very fair.

02:50:22.492 --> 02:50:28.258
MATT: She turns and Erwen comes up, you see him,
you know, the very very old halfling male with his

02:50:28.258 --> 02:50:35.821
long gray ponytail. "And it is great to see all of
you once more."

02:50:35.821 --> 02:50:36.595
MARISHA: Erwen!

02:50:36.595 --> 02:50:38.959
LIAM: Erwen.

02:50:39.373 --> 02:50:40.946
MARISHA: You're still alive!

02:50:40.946 --> 02:50:42.901
TALIESIN: Yeah, how did you manage?

02:50:42.901 --> 02:50:44.756
LIAM: We thought natural causes might, you know.

02:50:44.756 --> 02:50:45.588
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:50:45.588 --> 02:50:47.666
MATT: "Which was very possible, yes."

02:50:47.718 --> 02:50:48.986
TRAVIS: Can I insight check him?

02:50:48.986 --> 02:50:53.191
MATT: Yes, you may.

02:50:53.191 --> 02:50:56.823
TRAVIS: 19. No, is that a natural 20? It's a
natural 20.

02:50:56.823 --> 02:50:58.051
ASHLEY: That's a natural 20.

02:50:58.051 --> 02:50:59.419
MARISHA: Yeah, Gil!

02:50:59.419 --> 02:51:01.680
LAURA: Oh! He's coming over-- whispers about
Erwen.

02:51:01.680 --> 02:51:02.968
SAM: He is dead. He is a dead man.

02:51:02.968 --> 02:51:03.974
MARISHA: He's Hotis!

02:51:03.974 --> 02:51:07.079
LIAM: He has consumption.

02:51:07.511 --> 02:51:13.788
SAM: Guys, use the code 'lootcrate' to get 10% off
your monthly loot crate.

02:51:14.903 --> 02:51:23.228
TRAVIS: Well, I reach and I grab the dwarven
thrower. Welcome back, you son of a bitch.

02:51:23.228 --> 02:51:25.603
(all laugh)

02:51:25.603 --> 02:51:27.841
LIAM: (Grog voice) And I crush him into jam.

02:51:28.802 --> 02:51:37.388
MATT: "I must say, I greatly appreciate you all
being so quick in getting us out of that whole

02:51:37.388 --> 02:51:45.361
"dragon mess. I was rightfully frightened for my
life. Anyway, I need to continue making your

02:51:45.481 --> 02:51:49.589
"beds." And he slowly begins shuffling off towards
the stairway.

02:51:49.589 --> 02:51:51.659
TALIESIN: Well.

02:51:51.659 --> 02:51:52.706
MARISHA: Aw.

02:51:52.706 --> 02:51:54.367
ASHLEY: I love him.

02:51:54.367 --> 02:51:56.314
MARISHA: He's too good for us.

02:51:56.314 --> 02:51:57.320
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:51:57.320 --> 02:51:58.531
TALIESIN: That is unexpected.

02:51:58.531 --> 02:52:01.435
MARISHA: Yes, he's still alive.

02:52:01.826 --> 02:52:04.927
SAM: So, this is your house?

02:52:04.927 --> 02:52:06.307
LIAM: This is our keep, man.

02:52:06.307 --> 02:52:08.285
MARISHA: Yes! This is where we would have dinner.

02:52:08.285 --> 02:52:09.268
TALIESIN: It's more of a summer home.

02:52:09.268 --> 02:52:13.763
MARISHA: Oh! And that's a giant portrait of one of
our members who you haven't met, he made it riding

02:52:13.763 --> 02:52:20.817
on a unicorn. It's great. You should show him the
basement.

02:52:20.817 --> 02:52:23.363
TALIESIN: Oh no, we're going to get there, but I
figure we give him the full tour.

02:52:23.363 --> 02:52:25.493
TRAVIS: Are we gonna tell him the fucking name or
what?

02:52:25.493 --> 02:52:27.595
LAURA: Yeah, it's Greyskull Keep.

02:52:27.595 --> 02:52:28.657
LIAM: Fool.

02:52:28.657 --> 02:52:29.918
SAM: That's a really cool name.

02:52:29.918 --> 02:52:31.667
LAURA: I know, right?

02:52:31.667 --> 02:52:34.526
SAM: Wow. That's excellent!

02:52:34.526 --> 02:52:36.453
TALIESIN: I've been thinking about redecorating.

02:52:36.453 --> 02:52:38.933
SAM: Have you lived here very long, because
there's--

02:52:38.933 --> 02:52:40.766
TRAVIS: It's on and off.

02:52:40.766 --> 02:52:42.515
TALIESIN: Well, summer home really.

02:52:42.515 --> 02:52:43.792
LAURA: Unfortunately, not too long.

02:52:43.792 --> 02:52:46.420
LIAM: We've been vacationing from it for a while.

02:52:46.420 --> 02:52:53.966
SAM: You might want to consider different keepers
of this place. It seems a bit--

02:52:55.600 --> 02:52:57.664
LAURA: There were fucking dragons, Tary!

02:52:57.664 --> 02:52:58.144
SAM: All right.

02:52:58.144 --> 02:52:59.074
LAURA: Dragons!

02:52:59.074 --> 02:53:00.555
SAM: You're right, it's just, I'm just not used
to-

02:53:00.555 --> 02:53:04.863
TALIESIN: No, but if you have any input on decor
or otherwise, we would be interested.

02:53:04.863 --> 02:53:07.276
SAM: Lots of murals, lots of tapestries.

02:53:07.276 --> 02:53:08.674
TALIESIN: Oh, I would assume.

02:53:08.674 --> 02:53:13.026
TRAVIS: Most of the murals are of one of our
friends, but yeah.

02:53:13.026 --> 02:53:14.687
TALIESIN: We'll vary it up a bit.

02:53:14.687 --> 02:53:18.934
LIAM: I don't know how long we're staying here,
but you can have my old room. You got a room.

02:53:18.934 --> 02:53:20.386
SAM: Where will you sleep?

02:53:20.386 --> 02:53:21.471
LAURA: (laughs)

02:53:21.471 --> 02:53:22.757
TALIESIN: In my old room.

02:53:22.757 --> 02:53:28.907
(all laugh)

02:53:33.565 --> 02:53:37.857
SAM: All right, sure.

02:53:37.857 --> 02:53:39.946
LAURA: This is ridiculous.

02:53:39.946 --> 02:53:42.782
TALIESIN: It's good coffee today.

02:53:42.782 --> 02:53:49.866
MATT: This is the second time Polymachina has come
up in our campaign? Taryon and the two guards in

02:53:49.866 --> 02:53:56.085
Syngorn-- really confused. All right.

02:53:56.259 --> 02:53:59.622
TALIESIN: And I'll definitely show him the
downstairs, and anytime you want to use the

02:53:59.622 --> 02:54:03.727
workshop downstairs-- it's a bit thin at the
moment.

02:54:03.727 --> 02:54:05.577
MATT: Yeah, most of the tools have been stolen.

02:54:05.577 --> 02:54:08.486
SAM: Well, we'll have to go in town and buy some
replacements for you.

02:54:08.486 --> 02:54:09.360
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:54:09.360 --> 02:54:11.362
LIAM: You can make shit, though, what can you
make?

02:54:11.362 --> 02:54:14.011
SAM: Anything I set my mind to, if I have enough
raw materials.

02:54:14.011 --> 02:54:16.749
LIAM: Hats?

02:54:16.749 --> 02:54:19.142
SAM: Sure. You need a hat?

02:54:19.142 --> 02:54:20.682
TALIESIN: Invisibility?

02:54:20.682 --> 02:54:24.931
SAM: Sure, I've done that before. I've given you
invisibility coins.

02:54:24.931 --> 02:54:28.132
LIAM: Do you have a specialty? Do you do clothing,
or--

02:54:28.132 --> 02:54:29.691
SAM: Anything alchemic.

02:54:29.691 --> 02:54:31.702
TALIESIN: Teleportation?

02:54:31.702 --> 02:54:36.624
SAM: I don't think I can do that, but anything
that combines a little bit of magic with a little

02:54:36.624 --> 02:54:40.947
bit of engineering I can probably manage.

02:54:40.947 --> 02:54:43.201
LIAM: What about a beard trimmer?

02:54:43.201 --> 02:54:44.740
SAM: A beard trimmer?

02:54:44.740 --> 02:54:45.535
LIAM: Yes.

02:54:45.535 --> 02:54:46.296
TRAVIS: What?

02:54:46.296 --> 02:54:47.299
LIAM: He's looking a little shaggy.

02:54:47.299 --> 02:54:48.317
TALIESIN: Death has changed you.

02:54:48.317 --> 02:54:54.378
SAM: Sure, that seems like an easy thing to do.
You seem pretty clean-shaven, though.

02:54:54.378 --> 02:55:00.536
LIAM: Yeah, I don't grow thick. It's pretty
sparse, actually.

02:55:00.536 --> 02:55:01.470
LAURA: What?

02:55:01.470 --> 02:55:02.519
ASHLEY: Whoopsie.

02:55:02.519 --> 02:55:03.341
LAURA: Uh.

02:55:03.341 --> 02:55:04.528
TALIESIN: Oh.

02:55:04.528 --> 02:55:05.966
LIAM: Dirty birds.

02:55:05.966 --> 02:55:09.331
LAURA: I go to the library.

02:55:09.331 --> 02:55:13.319
LIAM: Wait! Where're you going? I want to go to
the library. Yeah, beard trimmer.

02:55:13.319 --> 02:55:14.288
SAM: I'm on it.

02:55:14.288 --> 02:55:15.315
LIAM: I need a beard trimmer.

02:55:15.315 --> 02:55:17.527
SAM: I'm on it, Vax.

02:55:17.527 --> 02:55:21.349
TALIESIN: Feel free to restock whatever's missing.
Keyleth and I, I think at the very least, and

02:55:21.349 --> 02:55:26.234
maybe anybody else who wants to go upstairs and
start poring through the wonderful private nooks

02:55:26.234 --> 02:55:28.312
and crannies of the library, please.

02:55:28.312 --> 02:55:30.648
TRAVIS: How are you going to do that, by the way?

02:55:30.648 --> 02:55:31.530
TALIESIN: Nooks and crannies?

02:55:31.530 --> 02:55:33.658
TRAVIS: Yeah, like, doesn't that require reading?

02:55:33.658 --> 02:55:37.273
TALIESIN: I've got-- well, they're not very good,
are they?

02:55:37.273 --> 02:55:39.345
TRAVIS: No, they're not, are they?

02:55:39.345 --> 02:55:42.231
TALIESIN: Do I have any spare-- I don't have any
spare glasses, do I?

02:55:42.231 --> 02:55:44.018
TRAVIS: What do you need?

02:55:44.018 --> 02:55:45.586
TALIESIN: I think I need the glasses.

02:55:45.586 --> 02:55:47.043
TRAVIS: What do you got?

02:55:47.043 --> 02:55:56.177
TALIESIN: Hm.

02:55:56.177 --> 02:55:58.632
LAURA: You already got his ascot, don't you?

02:55:58.632 --> 02:56:00.907
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:56:00.907 --> 02:56:03.663
TALIESIN: Let me think about that for a moment.
Carry on.

02:56:03.663 --> 02:56:07.274
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:56:07.274 --> 02:56:08.220
MATT: All right.

02:56:08.220 --> 02:56:09.983
ASHLEY: Grog, did you steal Percy's glasses?

02:56:09.983 --> 02:56:11.566
TRAVIS: No, he actually gave them to me.

02:56:11.566 --> 02:56:12.554
ASHLEY: Oh!

02:56:12.554 --> 02:56:18.752
TRAVIS: Yep. But I found out from Vex, that when
you trade, you get something in return and last

02:56:18.752 --> 02:56:22.907
time, I got a title. Yep.

02:56:22.907 --> 02:56:23.949
ASHLEY: You did?

02:56:23.949 --> 02:56:26.865
TRAVIS: Yeah I'm the Grand Doopa Babink of All
Didedah.

02:56:26.865 --> 02:56:29.944
(all laugh)

02:56:29.944 --> 02:56:32.771
ASHLEY: That sounds fun.

02:56:32.771 --> 02:56:39.780
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's a top secret title and it comes
with all the land and money,

02:56:39.780 --> 02:56:40.949
and a bunch of short names.

02:56:40.949 --> 02:56:42.428
TALIESIN: I'm very quickly going to craft
something super simple.

02:56:42.428 --> 02:56:43.483
MATT: What're you crafting?

02:56:43.483 --> 02:56:44.515
ASHLEY: Lands and money where?

02:56:44.515 --> 02:56:45.817
TALIESIN: I want to make a little foil pinwheel
out of tin.

02:56:45.817 --> 02:56:46.882
TRAVIS: I don't know. Probably everywhere.

02:56:46.882 --> 02:56:47.940
MATT: Yeah. Make a tinkering check.

02:56:47.940 --> 02:56:49.087
ASHLEY: I always knew you were royalty.

02:56:49.087 --> 02:56:50.236
LAURA: (laughs)

02:56:50.236 --> 02:56:51.532
TALIESIN: It's proficiency plus dex?

02:56:51.532 --> 02:56:52.703
MATT: Yeah.

02:56:52.703 --> 02:56:56.955
TALIESIN: I can never remember. Well, you know,
that's probably good enough. Let's see. 18?

02:56:56.955 --> 02:56:58.910
MATT: You just didn't roll a one.

02:56:58.910 --> 02:56:59.954
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:56:59.954 --> 02:57:04.381
MATT: You're fine. Yeah, you produce a-- with what
little materials you have there-- raw materials

02:57:04.381 --> 02:57:06.148
left, you happily do so.

02:57:06.148 --> 02:57:12.260
TALIESIN: I have made a tiny pinwheel. It spins.
And it's made of metal.

02:57:12.260 --> 02:57:14.424
MARISHA: I do a little gust cantrip to blow it.

02:57:14.424 --> 02:57:17.854
TALIESIN: And I put it on your lapel or your
little strap that counts as a--

02:57:17.854 --> 02:57:20.688
I just put it in a belt loop.

02:57:20.688 --> 02:57:22.009
ASHLEY: That's the cutest thing.

02:57:22.009 --> 02:57:24.227
TRAVIS: Am I a fucking child?

02:57:24.227 --> 02:57:29.514
TALIESIN: Now you know if there's wind blowing.
This is what I had I'm really like-- I'll give the

02:57:29.514 --> 02:57:32.470
glasses back when I'm done with them. This is a
rental charge.

02:57:32.470 --> 02:57:38.368
TRAVIS: Because of my high office, I will forgive
this offense. Come back when you're serious. Cloak

02:57:38.368 --> 02:57:43.096
of smashing, title, whatever. I'm sure you're very
smart. You'll think of something.

02:57:43.258 --> 02:57:45.320
MARISHA: You want another title?

02:57:45.490 --> 02:57:47.246
TRAVIS: I'll keep this as a deposit though.

02:57:47.246 --> 02:57:51.811
(all laugh)

02:57:51.811 --> 02:57:55.251
TALIESIN: Shit.

02:57:55.251 --> 02:57:58.239
MARISHA: Just give him another title.

02:57:58.239 --> 02:58:00.964
TALIESIN: Oh dear.

02:58:03.863 --> 02:58:07.444
MATT: All right, so you guys go to the library.
What're you looking for specifically?

02:58:08.240 --> 02:58:11.093
LAURA: What're we doing? Researching something.
Hotis? And like the Nine Hells.

02:58:11.093 --> 02:58:11.991
LIAM: Hell.

02:58:11.991 --> 02:58:13.298
MATT: Investigation check.

02:58:13.298 --> 02:58:14.943
LIAM: Orcus?

02:58:14.943 --> 02:58:20.541
LAURA: All of it. Ooh! 26!

02:58:20.541 --> 02:58:21.570
LIAM: Which one are we doing?

02:58:21.570 --> 02:58:22.388
LAURA: Investigation.

02:58:22.388 --> 02:58:23.374
LIAM: Investigation?

02:58:23.374 --> 02:58:25.330
TALIESIN: I'm just going to help with the spines
of books at this point.

02:58:25.330 --> 02:58:26.084
LIAM: 23.

02:58:26.084 --> 02:58:26.828
MATT: Okay.

02:58:26.828 --> 02:58:27.505
LIAM: Damn it!

02:58:27.505 --> 02:58:29.185
MARISHA: Yeah I'll do the reading for Percy until
he gets his glasses back.

02:58:29.185 --> 02:58:36.598
MATT: There you go. You're hard-pressed to find
anything in your library that gets very specific.

02:58:36.598 --> 02:58:44.094
There are mythological mentions of the Nine Hells,
of multiple layers, of demon princes. But the

02:58:44.094 --> 02:58:49.416
books that you have at your disposal largely speak
about them like a fairy tale. Or talk about

02:58:49.416 --> 02:58:55.907
historical mentions of them through the history of
Exandria, of the betrayer gods, and the old age of

02:58:55.907 --> 02:59:00.612
arcanum days. But nothing specifically about the
hells. So even with the research, you just don't

02:59:00.612 --> 02:59:03.483
have those books in the keep.

02:59:03.853 --> 02:59:06.237
LAURA: We got to go somewhere better.

02:59:06.237 --> 02:59:10.036
LIAM: Vasselheim. Isn't there a library there?

02:59:10.036 --> 02:59:13.107
LAURA: There's a library here. The Cobalt Reserve.
It was just kind of smashed, but I wonder if

02:59:13.107 --> 02:59:14.346
there's still books there.

02:59:14.346 --> 02:59:15.390
LIAM: Is it blown to shit?

02:59:15.390 --> 02:59:16.521
MATT: The Cobalt Reserve is in Westruun.

02:59:16.521 --> 02:59:17.963
LAURA: Just kidding. It's in Westruun.

02:59:17.963 --> 02:59:22.941
MATT: But it is essentially the largest collection
of the most dense and

02:59:22.941 --> 02:59:24.312
sacred books on the continent.

02:59:24.312 --> 02:59:25.698
LIAM: Hey, that's a good idea you just had.

02:59:25.698 --> 02:59:26.498
LAURA: Hey!

02:59:26.498 --> 02:59:27.361
LIAM: In Westruun.

02:59:27.361 --> 02:59:29.668
LAURA: I was just wrong about, yeah, the city.
That's it.

02:59:29.668 --> 02:59:31.254
LIAM: Well shit, all right.

02:59:31.254 --> 02:59:32.491
LAURA: What do you think?

02:59:32.491 --> 02:59:37.251
LIAM: Well, I don't think we should go charging
into the Nine Hells like we did the ocean.

02:59:37.251 --> 02:59:39.712
LAURA: No. (laughs)

02:59:39.712 --> 02:59:42.247
TALIESIN: When you put it like that.

02:59:42.247 --> 02:59:46.039
LIAM: Yeah, let's try to prepare better.

02:59:46.039 --> 02:59:47.043
LAURA: Shall we go to Westruun?

02:59:47.043 --> 02:59:48.287
LIAM: Yeah. Maybe not today.

02:59:48.287 --> 02:59:49.015
LAURA: No.

02:59:49.015 --> 02:59:50.629
LIAM: We just got here. But yeah.

02:59:50.629 --> 02:59:51.834
LAURA: That's where we'll go to?

02:59:51.834 --> 02:59:53.024
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:59:53.024 --> 02:59:54.720
LAURA: Yeah? Tight? Tight?

02:59:54.720 --> 02:59:58.087
TALIESIN: A'ight.

02:59:58.087 --> 03:00:01.208
MARISHA: We're reading papers from Raishan's.

03:00:01.269 --> 03:00:02.513
TALIESIN: Also, yeah.

03:00:02.513 --> 03:00:07.124
MATT: So you're pulling some of the notes you had
gathered-- what languages do you guys speak?

03:00:07.365 --> 03:00:09.101
MARISHA: I speak Primordial.

03:00:09.101 --> 03:00:10.120
MATT: Speak or read.

03:00:10.120 --> 03:00:11.828
MARISHA: And, well.

03:00:11.828 --> 03:00:14.867
TALIESIN: High-school Spanish.

03:00:14.867 --> 03:00:17.670
MARISHA: Primordial, Druidic, Sylvan, Elven.

03:00:17.670 --> 03:00:19.397
TALIESIN: Common, Celestial, Elven.

03:00:19.397 --> 03:00:20.292
MATT: Right.

03:00:20.292 --> 03:00:22.000
LAURA: Draconic, Abyssal.

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:26.525
MATT: Most of these notes you cannot read. The
language you've-- Percival, you recognize the

03:00:26.525 --> 03:00:28.842
script. A lot of them are written in Abyssal.

03:00:28.842 --> 03:00:29.925
TALIESIN: All right.

03:00:29.925 --> 03:00:31.011
LAURA: I can read Abyssal.

03:00:31.011 --> 03:00:33.996
LIAM: We read Abyssal, we studied it in school.

03:00:33.996 --> 03:00:35.945
MATT: Right, so do you go and call their help?

03:00:35.945 --> 03:00:40.211
TALIESIN: Who reads Abyssal? I can't-- who reads
at all. This is all out of focus.

03:00:40.211 --> 03:00:41.361
LAURA: I read Abyssal.

03:00:41.361 --> 03:00:43.137
LIAM: Oh, do you need help reading a book,
Percival?

03:00:43.137 --> 03:00:46.196
LAURA: Do you need help because we both speak
Abyssal?

03:00:46.196 --> 03:00:49.161
MARISHA: Grog stole his glasses, go easy on him.

03:00:49.161 --> 03:00:50.308
SAM: That's cool.

03:00:50.308 --> 03:00:51.717
TRAVIS: I did not steal. They were a gift.

03:00:51.717 --> 03:00:55.827
LIAM: Excuse, me but this is a once-in-a-lifetime
moment for me.

03:00:55.827 --> 03:00:57.190
TALIESIN: Are you enjoying yourself?

03:00:57.190 --> 03:00:58.206
LIAM: Do you-- immensely.

03:00:58.206 --> 03:01:02.143
TALIESIN: This is my gift to you. Happy
Rebirthday.

03:01:02.143 --> 03:01:06.051
LIAM: Thank you, Freddie. Have a seat, let me
translate for you.

03:01:06.051 --> 03:01:09.546
And a very merry Unbirthday to you.

03:01:09.546 --> 03:01:13.607
TALIESIN: I'm glad I let Grog hit you 'cause I
know it hurt more.

03:01:13.607 --> 03:01:21.538
MATT: All right, so you glance through some of the
notes that were gathered. A lot of them appear to

03:01:21.538 --> 03:01:33.139
be almost gibberish in the order of words. They
don't make sense. Or at least--

03:01:33.139 --> 03:01:38.089
LIAM: In Abyssal, the verb goes at the end of the
sentence, which is different than in Common. You

03:01:38.089 --> 03:01:41.146
might not have known that.

03:01:41.146 --> 03:01:50.861
MATT: You do make up some of them are historical
discussions on the roots of powerful magic.

03:01:50.861 --> 03:02:00.479
Elements during the founding, they're mentioned a
few times. They speak of the original Titans, it's

03:02:00.479 --> 03:02:09.276
a lot of very similarly and type-dense scattered
notes. Some of the books that you pull are

03:02:09.330 --> 03:02:15.333
specifically arcane spellbooks, but they're also
written in Abyssal. And as neither of you are

03:02:15.394 --> 03:02:20.129
practitioners of arcane magic, you have no idea
what they say, you just recognize them to be sort

03:02:20.129 --> 03:02:21.842
of spell markings.

03:02:21.842 --> 03:02:23.363
LIAM: That's some bullshit.

03:02:23.363 --> 03:02:25.036
MARISHA: Don't say those things out loud.

03:02:25.036 --> 03:02:28.487
MATT: There is the one large dark leather tome
that is still locked on the side, and that was

03:02:28.487 --> 03:02:29.697
what was on the--

03:02:29.697 --> 03:02:33.316
LAURA: Right. That one feels, is like super
scary-looking, though, right?

03:02:33.316 --> 03:02:40.058
MATT: Of all the books, it looks like probably the
premium book of Opash's collection.

03:02:40.058 --> 03:02:44.419
LAURA: Does it have writing on the cover?

03:02:44.419 --> 03:02:53.477
MATT: It has no writing on the cover. It is just a
dark black, leather-bound tome roughly that big

03:02:53.477 --> 03:02:59.195
that looks like it's weathered, scratched in
places. It has kind of like a deep, metallic

03:02:59.195 --> 03:03:01.181
cornered trimmed bits to it.

03:03:01.181 --> 03:03:05.322
LAURA: But Gilmore looked at that. I had Gilmore
look at it and he said it was scary.

03:03:05.322 --> 03:03:12.249
MATT: He said whoever decides to read it should be
strong of will. That was his warning.

03:03:12.249 --> 03:03:13.860
LAURA: Right.

03:03:13.860 --> 03:03:20.428
TALIESIN: Yeah, a lock on a book is one of those
universal titles that make sense in any language.

03:03:20.428 --> 03:03:21.426
LAURA: Question.

03:03:21.426 --> 03:03:22.161
MATT: Yes?

03:03:22.161 --> 03:03:25.373
LAURA: DM? What would will-- is that wisdom?

03:03:25.373 --> 03:03:26.394
MATT: That's like wisdom modifier.

03:03:26.394 --> 03:03:27.207
LAURA: Okay.

03:03:27.207 --> 03:03:29.276
MATT: Generally, like wisdom saving throw. That's
generally the kind of

03:03:29.276 --> 03:03:30.956
willpower tests elements of it.

03:03:30.956 --> 03:03:34.523
LIAM: Did Shaun say to read it or to open it, do
we remember?

03:03:34.523 --> 03:03:36.432
LAURA: He said whoever read it had to be careful.

03:03:36.432 --> 03:03:37.431
MATT: Read it.

03:03:37.431 --> 03:03:40.527
LIAM: Okay. Do I see any kind of trap to the
lock?

03:03:40.527 --> 03:03:42.701
MATT: Investigation check.

03:03:42.701 --> 03:03:44.576
TALIESIN: Are we going there?

03:03:44.576 --> 03:03:45.766
LIAM: No, I'm just checking, I'm not opening it.

03:03:45.766 --> 03:03:46.953
LAURA: Whoa! Pike should read it.

03:03:46.953 --> 03:03:47.731
MATT: If you wish to.

03:03:47.731 --> 03:03:48.587
LIAM: That's fine.

03:03:48.587 --> 03:03:49.362
TRAVIS: Pike should read it.

03:03:49.362 --> 03:03:50.748
LIAM: Perception you said? 22.

03:03:50.748 --> 03:03:53.125
LAURA: Pike's got crazy wisdom, we should make her
look at it.

03:03:53.125 --> 03:03:56.806
MATT: 22? It does not appear to be trapped, it is
locked though.

03:03:56.806 --> 03:04:01.897
LIAM: Okay. I will-- do we want to crack this shit
open now?

03:04:01.897 --> 03:04:03.131
TRAVIS: Yes! Absolutely.

03:04:03.131 --> 03:04:04.636
LAURA: I mean, maybe Pike should look at it.

03:04:04.636 --> 03:04:07.655
LIAM: Yeah, I'm not gonna fucking read it, I'm
just gonna open it for Pike.

03:04:07.655 --> 03:04:09.769
MARISHA: Did you detect any traps?

03:04:09.769 --> 03:04:11.424
LIAM: I didn't. Seems all right.

03:04:11.424 --> 03:04:12.943
MARISHA: Can I do Detect Magic on it? Sorry.

03:04:12.943 --> 03:04:14.532
SAM: Can I-- no, it's fine.

03:04:14.532 --> 03:04:16.376
MATT: You've already been told that it's magical
from Gilmore earlier.

03:04:16.376 --> 03:04:17.326
LAURA: Gilmore looked at it.

03:04:17.326 --> 03:04:19.275
SAM: Can I cast Identify on the lock or
something?

03:04:19.275 --> 03:04:20.381
LAURA: On the book?

03:04:20.381 --> 03:04:21.832
LIAM: Or on the book.

03:04:21.832 --> 03:04:31.704
MATT: That's essentially what Gilmore did. It's
not a magical item with abilities or powers. It

03:04:31.704 --> 03:04:34.866
just has a magical essence to it and it's
ancient.

03:04:35.495 --> 03:04:36.942
LAURA: We should have Pike look at this.

03:04:36.942 --> 03:04:37.644
TRAVIS: Yup.

03:04:37.644 --> 03:04:39.413
LAURA: Pike! Look at this.

03:04:39.413 --> 03:04:40.528
LIAM: I'm gonna try to unlock it.

03:04:40.528 --> 03:04:42.618
LAURA: Wait, wait, I just wanted to-- oh god.

03:04:42.618 --> 03:04:43.961
MATT: All right, make a lock-picking check.

03:04:43.961 --> 03:04:45.812
LIAM: Well no, is there anything you want to do,
Pike, before I open it?

03:04:45.812 --> 03:04:48.997
LAURA: It's just a dark book, we found it in
Raishan, well in--

03:04:48.997 --> 03:04:51.902
MATT: Opash's slash Thordak's lair.

03:04:51.902 --> 03:04:53.132
LAURA: Opash's lair.

03:04:53.132 --> 03:04:54.297
MARISHA: Slash Raishan's.

03:04:54.297 --> 03:04:57.282
TALIESIN: It's a locked book of unspeakable evil.

03:04:57.282 --> 03:04:59.710
LAURA: Gilmore said to be careful of it.

03:04:59.710 --> 03:05:01.330
TRAVIS: It's made from, like, flesh?

03:05:01.330 --> 03:05:03.755
SAM: Do you fellows think that it will explode, or
something bad, when we open it?

03:05:03.755 --> 03:05:05.030
TALIESIN: Oh, god, if that's all--

03:05:05.030 --> 03:05:07.003
LAURA: We're just sort of afraid it will take over
someone's mind or something.

03:05:07.003 --> 03:05:07.859
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:05:07.859 --> 03:05:09.167
SAM: Why don't we have Doty open it?

03:05:09.167 --> 03:05:11.178
MARISHA: What's your will, Pike? Your wisdom?

03:05:11.178 --> 03:05:13.338
TALIESIN: What's Doty's willpower?

03:05:13.393 --> 03:05:15.201
SAM: I dunno, it doesn't matter. If he breaks,
I'll fix him.

03:05:15.201 --> 03:05:17.970
ASHLEY: It would be considered saving-- you would
add your saving throw wisdom?

03:05:17.970 --> 03:05:19.084
MATT: We'll find out.

03:05:19.084 --> 03:05:20.343
LAURA: Ohh.

03:05:20.343 --> 03:05:24.418
MARISHA: Can I assist Pike in some way since we're
both wise as fuck?

03:05:24.418 --> 03:05:26.298
MATT: You guys could both attempt to read it
together and

03:05:26.298 --> 03:05:28.923
you'd both have to possibly be tested.

03:05:28.923 --> 03:05:29.969
ASHLEY: Tested?

03:05:29.969 --> 03:05:30.968
MATT: That's your call.

03:05:30.968 --> 03:05:31.824
SAM: Wow.

03:05:31.824 --> 03:05:33.082
MARISHA: My saving throw modifier is plus 11.

03:05:33.082 --> 03:05:34.131
LAURA: Pike is really, really wise.

03:05:34.131 --> 03:05:34.810
SAM: Wow.

03:05:34.810 --> 03:05:35.577
LIAM: All right, so, hold on a minute.

03:05:35.577 --> 03:05:36.509
ASHLEY: Oh, shit.

03:05:36.509 --> 03:05:37.451
MARISHA: -- and my regular modifier is plus six.

03:05:37.451 --> 03:05:38.243
MATT: What are we doing?

03:05:38.243 --> 03:05:41.082
LIAM: Hold on a minute. I'm gonna unlock it. I'm
not even gonna open it. I'm just gonna unlock it.

03:05:41.082 --> 03:05:42.545
So I get between everybody and the book.

03:05:42.545 --> 03:05:43.329
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:05:43.329 --> 03:05:44.269
LAURA: Close your eyes as soon as you unlock it.

03:05:44.269 --> 03:05:45.663
LIAM: Okay.

03:05:45.663 --> 03:05:47.515
LAURA: (laughs)

03:05:47.515 --> 03:05:53.753
LIAM: That is a-- That's fine. That's a 26.

03:05:53.753 --> 03:05:56.625
MATT: It opens.

03:05:56.625 --> 03:05:57.893
LIAM: Okay, hold on.

03:05:57.893 --> 03:05:58.880
LAURA: I back away.

03:05:58.880 --> 03:05:59.408
SAM: Ooh.

03:05:59.408 --> 03:06:00.295
LIAM: Hold on.

03:06:00.295 --> 03:06:01.039
MATT: The latch opens, not the book.

03:06:01.039 --> 03:06:02.832
LIAM: Hold on. Keyleth, Pike, Vex, c'mere.

03:06:02.832 --> 03:06:04.388
LAURA: I'm in the doorway, man.

03:06:04.388 --> 03:06:05.540
TALIESIN: I can't read it anyway.

03:06:05.540 --> 03:06:06.536
ASHLEY: We can do it.

03:06:06.536 --> 03:06:07.591
MARISHA: I go up. I go up.

03:06:07.591 --> 03:06:08.250
ASHLEY: We can do it together.

03:06:08.250 --> 03:06:09.344
TRAVIS: Yeah, just you two.

03:06:09.344 --> 03:06:10.094
MARISHA: I don't know, I don't know.

03:06:10.094 --> 03:06:16.810
LIAM: I cast Bless on Pickle, on Keyleth, and my
twin's far away, so I guess on myself.

03:06:16.810 --> 03:06:17.700
ASHLEY: What do we get?

03:06:17.700 --> 03:06:19.123
LIAM: And then I step behind the girls--

03:06:19.123 --> 03:06:20.371
LAURA: (laughs)

03:06:20.371 --> 03:06:21.328
MATT: Okay.

03:06:21.328 --> 03:06:22.356
LIAM: -- and watch.

03:06:22.356 --> 03:06:24.851
MATT: All right. Who's doing what?

03:06:24.851 --> 03:06:28.386
TRAVIS: Oh no, look at that face. Holy shit,
look--

03:06:28.386 --> 03:06:30.242
LAURA: Oh no, what's that face? What's that face?

03:06:30.242 --> 03:06:32.044
TRAVIS: Look at that forehead. That's like an F5
tornado rolling in.

03:06:32.044 --> 03:06:34.215
SAM: Three people reading a book.

03:06:34.215 --> 03:06:34.971
ASHLEY: Should we have Doty open it?

03:06:34.971 --> 03:06:36.615
SAM: It doesn't get any more intense.

03:06:36.615 --> 03:06:38.464
(all laugh)

03:06:38.464 --> 03:06:39.501
MARISHA: This is what you tuned in for.

03:06:39.501 --> 03:06:41.987
TRAVIS: Let's not turn this into burying the
shoebox. It's just a book, let's just read it.

03:06:41.987 --> 03:06:46.162
ASHLEY: Should we have Doty look at it? We
wouldn't be able to tell.

03:06:46.162 --> 03:06:47.181
TALIESIN: That didn't work out.

03:06:47.181 --> 03:06:48.824
SAM: You seem much more powerful than Doty ever
will be.

03:06:48.824 --> 03:06:49.899
TRAVIS: He's also not alive.

03:06:49.899 --> 03:06:51.444
LAURA: Yeah, do it. Do it!

03:06:51.444 --> 03:06:52.414
LIAM: All right, then.

03:06:52.414 --> 03:06:53.927
LAURA: I mean, do it if you want to. I'm standing
in the doorway.

03:06:53.927 --> 03:07:00.369
MARISHA: Okay, all right, all right, if you wanna
read it, I will go over your shoulder and be on

03:07:00.369 --> 03:07:02.619
the ready in case anything bad happens.

03:07:02.619 --> 03:07:06.874
SAM: In a way, the cover of a book is kind of like
a door.

03:07:06.874 --> 03:07:07.823
LAURA: A little bit.

03:07:07.823 --> 03:07:08.918
MARISHA: It's true.

03:07:08.918 --> 03:07:09.697
MATT: (laughs)

03:07:09.697 --> 03:07:10.509
SAM: So we're facing another door.

03:07:10.509 --> 03:07:11.078
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:07:11.078 --> 03:07:11.801
MATT: All right, what?

03:07:11.801 --> 03:07:12.333
ASHLEY: I'm going to--

03:07:12.333 --> 03:07:13.562
LIAM: Trying to earn points with us, or what?

03:07:13.562 --> 03:07:14.963
SAM: (laughs)

03:07:14.963 --> 03:07:17.428
ASHLEY: -- take my quill.

03:07:17.428 --> 03:07:18.319
LAURA: (gasps)

03:07:18.319 --> 03:07:19.195
MATT: Okay.

03:07:19.195 --> 03:07:23.563
ASHLEY: And I'm just gonna peek it open, just a
little bit.

03:07:23.563 --> 03:07:25.024
MATT: Okay. You peek it open.

03:07:25.024 --> 03:07:26.579
SAM: (slamming noise)

03:07:26.579 --> 03:07:27.443
ASHLEY: Anything happens?

03:07:27.443 --> 03:07:30.060
MATT: Nah, just the top creaks open.

03:07:30.060 --> 03:07:32.156
SAM: Bikini islands.

03:07:32.156 --> 03:07:33.203
TALIESIN: This'll be like the end of the second
act--

03:07:33.203 --> 03:07:34.071
ASHLEY: Flip it open.

03:07:34.071 --> 03:07:35.097
TALIESIN: -- the second act of Ghostbusters.

03:07:35.097 --> 03:07:38.250
MATT: The top of the tome flips open. Couple pages
go like (fwoosh) kinda stuck to it, and then fall

03:07:38.250 --> 03:07:39.534
back into place.

03:07:39.534 --> 03:07:40.779
LIAM: Do a jump scare.

03:07:40.779 --> 03:07:41.532
ASHLEY: (spooky groaning noise)

03:07:41.532 --> 03:07:42.372
MARISHA: Fall back into place? Why? What?

03:07:42.372 --> 03:07:43.292
LAURA: Well, it's just open, it's just an open
book.

03:07:43.292 --> 03:07:45.723
MATT: The pages kinda like curl back in, almost
like they were stuck to the--

03:07:45.723 --> 03:07:46.645
MARISHA: Okay. Nothing weird.

03:07:46.645 --> 03:07:47.713
MATT: Nothing weird.

03:07:47.713 --> 03:07:48.689
LAURA: Just air.

03:07:48.689 --> 03:07:49.849
MARISHA: Just air, yeah, just a draft.

03:07:49.849 --> 03:07:55.821
MATT: A little bit of dust kinda like (swoosh)
off the bottom of it. The pages are old. You see a

03:07:55.821 --> 03:07:57.395
little bit of text drawn on it.

03:07:57.395 --> 03:07:58.978
LAURA: What does it say? What is it? What does it
look like?

03:07:58.978 --> 03:08:00.144
MATT: What languages do you know, Pike?

03:08:00.144 --> 03:08:01.913
LIAM: Shush.

03:08:03.629 --> 03:08:08.153
ASHLEY: Gnomish, Common, Underdark, Undercommon,
Dwarvish.

03:08:08.153 --> 03:08:09.180
LIAM: Ooh.

03:08:09.180 --> 03:08:10.742
MATT: You do not recognize the text.

03:08:10.742 --> 03:08:11.526
ASHLEY: I can't read it.

03:08:11.526 --> 03:08:12.314
LIAM: Is it Abyssal?

03:08:12.314 --> 03:08:12.879
LAURA: Shit.

03:08:12.879 --> 03:08:13.634
MATT: It is Abyssal.

03:08:13.634 --> 03:08:14.802
LAURA: Aw, fuck.

03:08:14.802 --> 03:08:16.800
MARISHA: You are the only ones who can speak
Abyssal.

03:08:16.800 --> 03:08:18.162
SAM: (laughs) That reaction.

03:08:18.162 --> 03:08:18.976
LAURA: Oh, no.

03:08:18.976 --> 03:08:19.875
TRAVIS: Time to die.

03:08:19.875 --> 03:08:21.375
LIAM: I'll do it.

03:08:21.375 --> 03:08:23.689
LAURA: What? Lemme see-- how much-- how wise are
you?

03:08:23.689 --> 03:08:24.439
MARISHA: Okay, all right--

03:08:24.439 --> 03:08:25.583
TRAVIS: I approve of this decision-making.

03:08:25.583 --> 03:08:26.286
MARISHA: -- hang on, hang on.

03:08:26.286 --> 03:08:27.106
ASHLEY: Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

03:08:27.106 --> 03:08:28.204
LAURA: You're not even as wise as I am.

03:08:28.204 --> 03:08:29.249
MARISHA: Who wants to read it? I can--

03:08:29.249 --> 03:08:30.444
LIAM: That's very subjective!

03:08:30.444 --> 03:08:31.591
LAURA: (laughs)

03:08:31.591 --> 03:08:32.687
MARISHA: I'll enhance your ability.

03:08:32.687 --> 03:08:33.586
TALIESIN: Do you act--

03:08:33.586 --> 03:08:35.860
MATT: Enhance does not really help with saving
throws. Just so you know.

03:08:35.860 --> 03:08:36.751
ASHLEY: I'll cast Bless--

03:08:36.751 --> 03:08:37.625
LIAM: I already did that.

03:08:37.625 --> 03:08:38.887
MATT: Just ability checks. If it's an ability
check, it'll help.

03:08:38.887 --> 03:08:39.980
LIAM: I Blessed myself.

03:08:39.980 --> 03:08:41.503
MATT: But just so you know.

03:08:41.503 --> 03:08:42.740
MARISHA: Can I do anything--

03:08:42.740 --> 03:08:43.984
MATT: That's up to you.

03:08:43.984 --> 03:08:44.987
SAM: Turn into a dragon.

03:08:44.987 --> 03:08:46.865
(all laugh)

03:08:46.865 --> 03:08:47.796
LAURA: I'm gonna step up.

03:08:47.796 --> 03:08:48.805
MARISHA: I just eat the book!

03:08:48.805 --> 03:08:49.509
MATT: (laughs)

03:08:49.509 --> 03:08:50.329
TALIESIN: (burps)

03:08:50.329 --> 03:08:51.196
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:08:51.196 --> 03:08:52.047
LAURA: I'm gonna go up and try to look at it.

03:08:52.047 --> 03:08:52.687
MATT: Okay.

03:08:52.687 --> 03:08:53.693
ASHLEY: I'm gonna cast Bless on her.

03:08:53.693 --> 03:08:54.303
MARISHA: Who's reading?

03:08:54.303 --> 03:08:54.757
MATT: Okay.

03:08:54.757 --> 03:08:55.574
MARISHA: Are you reading?

03:08:55.574 --> 03:08:56.208
LAURA: Yeah.

03:08:56.208 --> 03:08:56.786
MATT: So.

03:08:56.786 --> 03:08:59.902
MARISHA: I cast Enhance Ability on her and give
her, I think it's Owl's Wisdom.

03:08:59.902 --> 03:09:00.940
MATT: Sure, all right.

03:09:00.940 --> 03:09:01.832
LAURA/LIAM: Ooh!

03:09:01.832 --> 03:09:06.692
TALIESIN: I run over, I give you a quick kiss. I
say, if you turn evil, it's still cool. Just so

03:09:06.692 --> 03:09:07.864
you know.

03:09:07.864 --> 03:09:08.824
(all laugh)

03:09:08.824 --> 03:09:09.969
MATT: All right. So, Vex.

03:09:09.969 --> 03:09:10.771
LAURA: Yeah?

03:09:10.771 --> 03:09:16.970
MATT: You begin to glance through the pages and
the words form around you, and you get a ways into

03:09:16.970 --> 03:09:24.087
it, and it's interesting. This is a personal
notebook. It's a tome, but this is written by

03:09:24.087 --> 03:09:25.312
Opash, this is--

03:09:25.312 --> 03:09:26.527
LAURA: This is a gir-nal.

03:09:26.527 --> 03:09:28.490
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

03:09:28.490 --> 03:09:29.350
SAM: (blows raspberry)

03:09:29.350 --> 03:09:30.223
TALIESIN: Whoa.

03:09:30.223 --> 03:09:31.098
SAM: (laughs)

03:09:31.098 --> 03:09:32.260
LIAM: Well done. Well done.

03:09:32.260 --> 03:09:38.461
MATT: This goes into Opash's history on Marquet
during the Age of Arcanum, a lot of the terrible

03:09:38.461 --> 03:09:43.347
experiments that he was currently working on that
dealt with rending and capturing the soul.

03:09:43.347 --> 03:09:44.314
LAURA: (gasps)

03:09:44.314 --> 03:09:50.146
MATT: Capturing the servants and people that
wandered the desert and would just-- had a series

03:09:50.146 --> 03:09:52.431
of caverns across the continent that were--

03:09:52.431 --> 03:09:53.189
MARISHA: (sneezes)

03:09:53.189 --> 03:09:53.913
TALIESIN: Bless you.

03:09:53.913 --> 03:09:57.364
MATT: -- his to use, where he kept these
individuals trapped in gems or glass

03:09:57.364 --> 03:10:04.866
menagerie-type structures where he would come back
at his whim and just destroy souls, shatter them,

03:10:04.866 --> 03:10:11.797
corrupt them, forge them into things, feed on
them. He was fascinated with the never-ending

03:10:11.797 --> 03:10:17.756
essence of existence and how to manipulate it and
make it his own. It goes into that. It goes into

03:10:17.756 --> 03:10:20.878
people that didn't understand him in Marquet; how
he was driven out, the trials that were put

03:10:20.878 --> 03:10:26.621
against him, his banishment to the island. And
then in learning about the facet of this island

03:10:26.621 --> 03:10:32.600
that there's something about the metal here,
something very ancient about this island that

03:10:32.600 --> 03:10:38.428
becomes this black hole of arcane projection.
Astral Projection is not possible from the island,

03:10:38.428 --> 03:10:45.868
he discovered as he attempted that. And travel
magics that go to or from the island have a very

03:10:45.868 --> 03:10:51.048
difficult ability to escape it, if not get very
messed up in the process.

03:10:51.048 --> 03:10:52.099
MARISHA: We learned that.

03:10:52.099 --> 03:10:53.118
TALIESIN: Yep.

03:10:53.118 --> 03:10:57.099
MATT: However, it talks about how, when he was
banished there, he discovered the indigenous

03:10:57.099 --> 03:11:03.041
people and those that lived on nearby islands that
would take small ships from island to island, and

03:11:03.041 --> 03:11:11.175
there was a trade route there. He convinced and
corrupted them to come and work for him, and such,

03:11:11.175 --> 03:11:15.329
he brought the entire civilization from these
multiple islands to come live on this island under

03:11:15.329 --> 03:11:20.559
him. And then he reaved them all to become his
experiments to continue here on this island. And

03:11:20.559 --> 03:11:25.776
you get a sense, reading through, that the masses
of people you saw within that giant chasm that

03:11:25.776 --> 03:11:29.095
were clawing at you as you passed, those were all
the people that used to live on these islands.

03:11:29.095 --> 03:11:32.329
LAURA and ASHLEY: Oh my gosh!

03:11:32.329 --> 03:11:42.646
MATT: You then also discover a few different
chapters. One that mentions finding a near-dead

03:11:42.646 --> 03:11:50.858
dragon that washes on shore, a red dragon on the
cusp of death. And what a great gift it is, to

03:11:50.858 --> 03:11:57.173
discover, to toy with the soul of an ancient
entity like this. And it speaks of years of

03:11:57.173 --> 03:12:05.491
enslaving this red dragon and torturing and
extracting information and manipulating and making

03:12:05.491 --> 03:12:13.145
it his own toy. And then, began to pull together
research he had read elsewhere on the continuation

03:12:13.145 --> 03:12:19.175
of a dragon's soul, of being able to take the
spirit of a dragon and make it indestructible and

03:12:19.175 --> 03:12:27.630
to live from body to body. And if he could find a
way to correct this to work for himself it

03:12:27.630 --> 03:12:33.785
wouldn't be-- his power would continue without the
binds of lichdom that a lot of other type magics

03:12:33.785 --> 03:12:41.012
would eventually be bound to-- the phylactery
element, through a dragon transition would be a

03:12:41.012 --> 03:12:50.912
lot easier to maintain, and his hope for doing so.
It beings to speak of a ritual, one that involved

03:12:50.912 --> 03:12:58.333
this ancient, ancient entity dragon called Guuthal
the Ever-Fed. A mighty black dragon that was

03:12:58.333 --> 03:13:02.552
instilled with necromantic power that terrorized
the world during the Age of Arcanum in its first

03:13:02.552 --> 03:13:09.600
millennia. Guuthal had used ritualistic aid,
forbidden rites, and sacrifice of its own

03:13:09.600 --> 03:13:22.889
lifeforce to be born again as this never-dying new
form of unlife referred to as a dracolich.

03:13:22.889 --> 03:13:32.931
However, the last few notes in Opash's hand end
abruptly and

03:13:32.931 --> 03:13:36.495
a new handwriting in Draconic begins.

03:13:36.495 --> 03:13:37.594
LAURA: Which I also read.

03:13:37.594 --> 03:13:45.713
MATT: Which you also read. These notes are less
poetic and speaking to itself in the way Opash was

03:13:45.766 --> 03:13:51.773
by himself and needed somebody to converse with,
and he chose his words. This is a much more

03:13:51.773 --> 03:14:02.216
direct, trying to piece together parts of an
equation. And you start seeing references to J'mon

03:14:02.216 --> 03:14:11.669
Sa Ord, you see references to being the king that
rises from the ashes. You begin to realize that

03:14:11.669 --> 03:14:17.245
these are the words of Thordak. This was the
moment when Thordak overtook Opash, destroyed him,

03:14:17.245 --> 03:14:26.625
and made the lair his own. This history then goes
into Thordak's interest in trying to find power to

03:14:26.625 --> 03:14:34.656
take this ritual unto himself and thus become an
undying entity. The notes finish with the intent

03:14:34.656 --> 03:14:42.152
of Thordak going north to seek out mages, to seek
out power, things he could bind to his will and

03:14:42.152 --> 03:14:49.758
bring them back to make this ritual happen. That's
the last passage you see. You begin to realize

03:14:49.758 --> 03:14:57.488
that the knowledge that Thordak had, and was
holding from Raishan, was the knowledge of this

03:14:57.488 --> 03:15:05.391
ritual that would probably be what would enable
her to bypass the curse that she had.

03:15:05.391 --> 03:15:07.297
LAURA: Oh my gosh. But we killed her.

03:15:07.297 --> 03:15:09.037
MATT: But you killed her.

03:15:09.037 --> 03:15:11.290
LAURA: This could have been so much worse.

03:15:11.290 --> 03:15:13.151
MARISHA: Yes, it could've.

03:15:13.151 --> 03:15:15.838
MATT: I also need you to make a wisdom saving
throw.

03:15:15.838 --> 03:15:18.009
SAM: Ooh, shnikies!

03:15:18.009 --> 03:15:18.855
ASHLEY: Can I--

03:15:18.855 --> 03:15:20.063
LIAM: Bless, bless, bless.

03:15:20.063 --> 03:15:20.781
TRAVIS: Can I--

03:15:20.781 --> 03:15:21.891
LAURA: What does Bless do?

03:15:21.891 --> 03:15:24.609
ASHLEY: Can I also cast Beacon of Hope on her?

03:15:24.609 --> 03:15:25.777
SAM: It's like inspiration.

03:15:25.777 --> 03:15:26.964
LAURA: Don't fuck me, Gil!

03:15:26.964 --> 03:15:28.114
MATT: What's Beacon of Hope do?

03:15:28.114 --> 03:15:30.364
ASHLEY: Beacon of Hope gives you advantage on
wisdom saving throws.

03:15:30.364 --> 03:15:31.595
MATT: Okay.

03:15:31.595 --> 03:15:32.968
LAURA: Oh, tight.

03:15:32.968 --> 03:15:34.442
MATT: So, Beacon of Hope is cast.

03:15:34.442 --> 03:15:35.762
LIAM: It's already good.

03:15:35.762 --> 03:15:38.764
LAURA: Okay, 16.

03:15:38.764 --> 03:15:40.105
LIAM: Roll a d4 and add it.

03:15:40.105 --> 03:15:42.939
LAURA: It's just saving throw?

03:15:42.939 --> 03:15:45.279
MATT: Saving throw, yes.

03:15:45.279 --> 03:15:49.877
LAURA: 18 + 3 is 21, plus two.

03:15:49.877 --> 03:15:50.902
LIAM: What does that Owl's Wisdom do?

03:15:50.902 --> 03:15:51.812
LAURA: 23.

03:15:51.812 --> 03:15:52.610
MARISHA: Huh?

03:15:52.610 --> 03:15:53.514
LIAM: What does Owl's Wisdom do?

03:15:53.514 --> 03:15:56.493
MARISHA: It gives you advantage on wisdom checks.

03:15:56.493 --> 03:15:57.266
LAURA: Oh, okay.

03:15:57.266 --> 03:15:58.239
MARISHA: Not saving throws.

03:15:58.239 --> 03:16:03.458
MATT: Not saving throws. So, as you're reading
through this, you guys watch as Vex's attention--

03:16:03.458 --> 03:16:09.082
LAURA: Oh wait, (whispers) 18, 19, 20, 23 (louder)
25.

03:16:09.082 --> 03:16:11.157
MATT: 25, okay.

03:16:11.157 --> 03:16:14.602
LAURA: Oh no, that's a 16, I'm sorry! I was right,
it was 23. I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

03:16:14.602 --> 03:16:16.212
I'm sorry, I'm a dick!

03:16:16.212 --> 03:16:20.509
MATT: As you are reading through this, and you go
through, you watch as she turns the pages faster

03:16:20.509 --> 03:16:28.253
and faster and her eyes unblinkingly are just
scanning the pages with rapid pace. And, Vex, you

03:16:28.253 --> 03:16:34.648
feel this cold essence begin to curl through your
shoulders and into the back of the neck and right

03:16:34.648 --> 03:16:40.033
as you finish the last bit of notes before
Thordak, you feel something try to reach for the

03:16:40.033 --> 03:16:45.880
back of your mind. Cold fingers, ten, 20, an
endless supply of grasping fingers reach for the

03:16:45.880 --> 03:16:51.620
back of your mind. And you shrug it off and pull
yourself away from the book and the cold fades.

03:16:51.620 --> 03:16:54.406
LAURA: I shut the book.

03:16:55.589 --> 03:16:57.926
MARISHA: You all right?

03:16:57.926 --> 03:16:59.817
LAURA: Great.

03:16:59.817 --> 03:17:01.552
TRAVIS: Bad story?

03:17:01.552 --> 03:17:03.449
LAURA: I tell them everything I read.

03:17:03.449 --> 03:17:04.820
MATT: Yeah.

03:17:04.820 --> 03:17:07.358
LAURA: Super fast 'cause I'm, like, a speed reader
it's no big deal.

03:17:07.358 --> 03:17:10.159
LIAM: You were reading for like 25 minutes.

03:17:10.159 --> 03:17:11.721
LAURA: Oh shit! Well, it was a big journal.

03:17:11.721 --> 03:17:12.722
LIAM: Yeah.

03:17:12.722 --> 03:17:18.990
SAM: It's amazing. Anastasia Steele fell in love
with Christian Grey just like that? Amazing!

03:17:18.990 --> 03:17:20.594
(all laugh)

03:17:20.594 --> 03:17:21.742
TRAVIS: Jesus Christ.

03:17:21.742 --> 03:17:22.705
TALIESIN: It's a knockout.

03:17:22.705 --> 03:17:23.498
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

03:17:23.498 --> 03:17:25.048
TALIESIN: Wow, now I can feel the fingers in the
back of my head.

03:17:25.048 --> 03:17:27.145
(all laugh)

03:17:27.145 --> 03:17:28.859
MATT: All the rest of us making a wisdom saving
throw!

03:17:28.859 --> 03:17:30.075
TALIESIN: Damn it.

03:17:30.075 --> 03:17:34.542
SAM: I know Laura read that.

03:17:34.542 --> 03:17:40.780
LAURA: I read most of it and then I just threw the
book away.

03:17:40.780 --> 03:17:45.017
TALIESIN: Pike, can we destroy this thing?

03:17:45.017 --> 03:17:45.828
ASHLEY: That was--

03:17:45.828 --> 03:17:46.666
LAURA: Well--

03:17:46.666 --> 03:17:48.344
ASHELY: -- what I was going to see if we--

03:17:48.344 --> 03:17:51.776
LAURA: Should we destroy this thing? I feel like
maybe, I mean--

03:17:51.776 --> 03:17:53.591
TALIESIN: The knowledge exists now.

03:17:53.591 --> 03:17:54.492
LAURA: It's true.

03:17:54.492 --> 03:17:58.374
TALIESIN: It's outside the book, and if the book
was-- there's something in there.

03:17:58.374 --> 03:18:01.489
MARISHA: Can we have Doty copy down everything
that you just said?

03:18:01.489 --> 03:18:03.222
TALIESIN: Oh! Oh!

03:18:03.222 --> 03:18:04.595
LIAM: She said.

03:18:04.595 --> 03:18:08.275
MARISHA: Not actually exact transcriptions, just
so we keep the knowledge.

03:18:08.275 --> 03:18:11.096
TALIESIN: Transcription of the story.

03:18:11.096 --> 03:18:17.499
SAM: I mean, sure, he can record what her report
is if you like, sure, yes.

03:18:17.499 --> 03:18:18.428
TALIESIN: It would be invaluable.

03:18:18.428 --> 03:18:19.546
LAURA: All right.

03:18:19.546 --> 03:18:23.535
MATT: Doty walks over to one of the nearby shelves
and finds one of the books that is only partially

03:18:23.535 --> 03:18:25.071
written in, tears out all the pages--

03:18:25.071 --> 03:18:25.964
LAURA: Okay, no, okay.

03:18:25.964 --> 03:18:26.766
TALIESIN: That was--

03:18:26.766 --> 03:18:27.750
LAURA: That's something.

03:18:27.750 --> 03:18:30.371
MATT: -- and just begins transcribing from memory
what you just said.

03:18:30.371 --> 03:18:31.523
MARISHA: High school notes?

03:18:31.523 --> 03:18:36.603
TALIESIN: No, that was a sea captain's journal.
It's okay, it doesn't matter, it's not--

03:18:36.603 --> 03:18:39.229
SAM: He didn't burn them, we could just--

03:18:39.297 --> 03:18:40.972
TRAVIS: Are we doing that now? I mean, I can help
him, just--

03:18:40.972 --> 03:18:41.744
LAURA: No, Grog!

03:18:41.744 --> 03:18:42.725
TALIESIN: No no no no no!

03:18:42.725 --> 03:18:43.664
GROG: And I just rip--

03:18:43.664 --> 03:18:48.855
LAURA: Should we destroy-destroy this?

03:18:48.855 --> 03:18:51.963
TALIESIN: I think so.

03:18:51.963 --> 03:18:53.955
SAM: It's magical of some sort?

03:18:53.955 --> 03:18:59.310
LAURA: It certainly felt like something was trying
to reach through.

03:18:59.310 --> 03:19:01.759
MARISHA: That doesn't sit well with me.

03:19:01.759 --> 03:19:10.767
LAURA: And what good does it do the world to know
how to bring back souls as the undead? It seems

03:19:10.767 --> 03:19:11.811
kind of dark.

03:19:11.811 --> 03:19:15.154
SAM: Do you lot have some sort of a vault here or
something?

03:19:15.154 --> 03:19:16.895
TRAVIS: Do we?

03:19:16.895 --> 03:19:18.364
MATT: You didn't have one made.

03:19:18.364 --> 03:19:19.760
MARISHA: We don't here; we do in Whitestone.

03:19:19.760 --> 03:19:24.614
TALIESIN: Even if there is a vault, all the vault
is is a-- it's the one place in any city where

03:19:24.614 --> 03:19:28.754
everyone knows something valuable's kept.

03:19:28.754 --> 03:19:32.537
SAM: A magical vault somewhere you could send this
thing to be far away?

03:19:32.615 --> 03:19:34.047
LAURA: Well, we have a bag of holding.

03:19:34.047 --> 03:19:37.045
TRAVIS: Ooh! You know what? We could like send it
into the plane where Craven Edge is and we'll take

03:19:37.045 --> 03:19:39.014
the sword out and put the book in in its place.

03:19:39.014 --> 03:19:41.317
TALIESIN: You know, I feel like there's someone
collecting terrible things.

03:19:41.525 --> 03:19:42.524
LAURA: All terrible things.

03:19:42.524 --> 03:19:45.197
LIAM: We could throw it in the black spinny thing
under Whitestone, or--

03:19:45.197 --> 03:19:46.257
LAURA: Oh no!

03:19:46.257 --> 03:19:48.598
LIAM: -- we could just give it to Allura.

03:19:48.598 --> 03:19:53.034
MARISHA: We were also going to go the Cobalt
Reserve anyway, we could see, I'm sure they have

03:19:53.034 --> 03:19:58.230
some sort of a library special secret book vault.

03:19:58.230 --> 03:19:59.852
TALIESIN: I would feel all right with that.

03:19:59.852 --> 03:20:01.991
LAURA: Let's keep it in the bag of holding for the
time being.

03:20:02.040 --> 03:20:02.732
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:20:02.732 --> 03:20:03.698
TALIESIN: Let's re-lock it.

03:20:03.698 --> 03:20:04.395
LIAM: Big responsibility.

03:20:04.395 --> 03:20:05.061
LAURA: Definitely.

03:20:05.061 --> 03:20:05.709
MARISHA: Re-lock it.

03:20:05.709 --> 03:20:06.480
LAURA: Re-lock it. Re-lock it.

03:20:06.480 --> 03:20:07.865
MARISHA: I vote we take it to the Cobalt Reserve.

03:20:07.865 --> 03:20:08.876
TALIESIN: I concur.

03:20:08.876 --> 03:20:10.090
MATT: Okay.

03:20:10.090 --> 03:20:10.956
LIAM: Do you concur? I concur.

03:20:10.956 --> 03:20:11.764
LAURA: I concur.

03:20:11.764 --> 03:20:12.561
TALIESIN: You concur?

03:20:12.561 --> 03:20:16.816
MARISHA: Either that, or Vasselheim. One of the
two will have options, I'm sure.

03:20:16.816 --> 03:20:19.714
TALIESIN: I feel that the Cobalt Reserve will
probably have some sort of

03:20:19.714 --> 03:20:21.705
situation for books like this.

03:20:21.705 --> 03:20:22.498
MARISHA: Okay.

03:20:22.498 --> 03:20:24.159
TALIESIN: That seems reasonable.

03:20:24.159 --> 03:20:26.067
MATT: So, what's the next step?

03:20:26.067 --> 03:20:28.660
LAURA: We're going to go to Westruun. Right?

03:20:28.660 --> 03:20:32.770
MARISHA: Did we go through all of the papers that
Raishan and everything had, for the most part?

03:20:32.770 --> 03:20:37.792
MATT: All those notes seemed to pertain to that
book, and once you had the information from Vex,

03:20:37.792 --> 03:20:42.606
it kind of connected all the dots. A lot of these
were notes regarding this ritual. Trying to find

03:20:42.606 --> 03:20:50.881
ways to break the chain of the life/death cycle
and obsession with the alteration and harvesting

03:20:50.881 --> 03:20:56.329
of souls and spiritual energy for the use of
powering arcane experimentation.

03:20:56.329 --> 03:20:58.464
So, not good stuff.

03:20:58.464 --> 03:21:04.655
MARISHA: He mentioned going north and looking for
other powerful entities and objects to bind with.

03:21:04.655 --> 03:21:10.986
And then Raishan thought it would be a good idea
to settle down in Whitestone.

03:21:12.276 --> 03:21:13.742
TRAVIS: Before we killed Raishan, didn't she say--

03:21:13.742 --> 03:21:17.440
LAURA: Well, Wildmount is far north. Raishan said
she was from Wildmount.

03:21:17.440 --> 03:21:20.183
TRAVIS: Right. And she said she had found what she
needed.

03:21:20.183 --> 03:21:23.229
MATT: No, Raishan actually was from--

03:21:23.229 --> 03:21:24.179
TALIESIN: South.

03:21:24.179 --> 03:21:25.576
MATT: -- she was south of Tal'Dorei.

03:21:25.576 --> 03:21:26.178
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:21:26.178 --> 03:21:26.827
LAURA: She was?

03:21:26.827 --> 03:21:27.388
MATT: Yeah.

03:21:27.388 --> 03:21:28.015
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:21:28.015 --> 03:21:34.194
MARISHA: She had an interest in Whitestone, which
makes me wonder what the spinning black orb of

03:21:34.194 --> 03:21:38.446
death has to do with all of this. Because I'm
still not convinced that it doesn't have some sort

03:21:38.446 --> 03:21:40.335
of play in everything.

03:21:40.335 --> 03:21:43.172
TALIESIN: It's just a spinning black orb of death
sitting underneath my family home.

03:21:43.172 --> 03:21:44.234
LAURA: Dedicated to Vecna.

03:21:44.234 --> 03:21:48.621
TALIESIN: No. There's nothing-- I'm well aware
that it's terrible. I don't know why you're

03:21:48.621 --> 03:21:51.417
staring at me like that. Yes, I think about it a
lot. I'm--

03:21:51.417 --> 03:21:53.458
MARISHA: I'm just, you know--

03:21:53.458 --> 03:21:56.563
TALIESIN: I just don't know what to do about it.

03:21:56.563 --> 03:22:02.502
LIAM: Well, we can, well, not me, but smart people
can devote more attention now that there's not

03:22:02.502 --> 03:22:05.005
five great dragons trying to tear the world
apart.

03:22:05.005 --> 03:22:06.131
TALIESIN: We'll help.

03:22:06.131 --> 03:22:07.525
MARISHA: What time is it?

03:22:07.525 --> 03:22:11.030
MATT: At this time, with you guys travelling
through the city, getting here, with the research,

03:22:11.030 --> 03:22:17.755
I'd say it's getting pretty close to dusk. You
probably have like an hour or so

03:22:17.755 --> 03:22:20.369
before the sun sets.

03:22:21.976 --> 03:22:24.983
MARISHA: You all want to rest? Take the night off,
head to Westruun in the morning?

03:22:24.983 --> 03:22:25.930
LAURA: Sure.

03:22:25.930 --> 03:22:27.524
LIAM: Yeah. Back to the keep.

03:22:27.524 --> 03:22:29.433
TALIESIN: Back to the keep. We are in the keep.

03:22:29.433 --> 03:22:30.254
MARISHA: We are in the keep.

03:22:30.254 --> 03:22:31.156
MATT: You are in the keep.

03:22:31.156 --> 03:22:32.918
LIAM: We stay in the keep.

03:22:32.918 --> 03:22:39.191
SAM: Has Emon come back enough to have shops open
for business or anything?

03:22:39.191 --> 03:22:43.249
MATT: Yeah, I mean, not everything was destroyed.
There are shops that are open and there are people

03:22:43.249 --> 03:22:47.059
running business here. I mean, a number of the
districts got damaged and some buildings are

03:22:47.059 --> 03:22:55.542
having to be rebuilt, but it is still a functional
city. Though to a lesser degree right now.

03:22:55.873 --> 03:22:56.954
MARISHA: You know, before we--

03:22:56.954 --> 03:22:58.593
TALIESIN: Did you want to shop now or later?

03:22:58.593 --> 03:23:03.236
SAM: I don't want to waste time. Everything I do,
I have to buy.

03:23:03.236 --> 03:23:04.640
LAURA: Oh.

03:23:04.640 --> 03:23:07.561
TALIESIN: Well, we can shop in the morning, on the
way out.

03:23:07.561 --> 03:23:08.296
LAURA: Yeah.

03:23:08.296 --> 03:23:09.849
SAM: Sure. Yep.

03:23:09.849 --> 03:23:10.877
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's fair.

03:23:10.877 --> 03:23:13.582
LAURA: Not in a huge rush. Yeah.

03:23:13.582 --> 03:23:15.536
SAM: I'm at your disposal.

03:23:15.536 --> 03:23:19.686
LAURA: We'll shop in Emon in the morning and then
head out to Westruun. They'll have shops there,

03:23:19.686 --> 03:23:21.240
too. Just not as many.

03:23:21.240 --> 03:23:22.389
TALIESIN: Brunch.

03:23:22.389 --> 03:23:23.384
MARISHA: Brunch.

03:23:23.384 --> 03:23:24.423
SAM: At dawn, we brunch.

03:23:24.423 --> 03:23:25.429
TALIESIN: At dawn, we brunch.

03:23:25.429 --> 03:23:27.163
LIAM: Please. Please.

03:23:27.163 --> 03:23:29.471
TALIESIN: No chicken.

03:23:29.471 --> 03:23:35.037
MATT: As the sun sets across the Tal'Dorei sky,
you all settle in for the evening to rest,

03:23:35.037 --> 03:23:40.714
contemplate the return of your ally. Your next
venture in researching the path before you as Vox

03:23:40.714 --> 03:23:48.100
Machina. You to return soon to finish your
Aramente to your people and see what lies ahead of

03:23:48.100 --> 03:23:54.291
you by the threads of fate wielded by the Raven
Queen. At dawn, you brunch. And until then we'll

03:23:54.291 --> 03:23:56.692
return next week, with the next episode of
Critical Role.

03:23:56.692 --> 03:24:00.541
(all cheer)

03:24:00.541 --> 03:24:03.490
LAURA: (sings) Everybody's still alive for the
time being.

03:24:03.490 --> 03:24:04.581
LIAM: I really want brunch right now.

03:24:04.581 --> 03:24:05.769
TALIESIN: I just want brunch so badly.

03:24:05.769 --> 03:24:07.302
MATT: I know.

03:24:07.302 --> 03:24:08.578
TALIESIN: I miss brunch.

03:24:08.578 --> 03:24:12.038
LAURA: Those donuts were pretty fucking great.

03:24:12.038 --> 03:24:16.243
MATT: Well, guys, thank you for watching.
Congratulations to our winner earlier. Thank you

03:24:16.243 --> 03:24:17.579
again, Loot Crate, for being our awesome sponsor.

03:24:17.579 --> 03:24:19.539
ALL: Loot Crate!

03:24:19.539 --> 03:24:20.491
MATT: What's that?

03:24:20.491 --> 03:24:21.591
CREW: We did make it for Amandine.

03:24:21.591 --> 03:24:22.436
MATT: We made it for Amandine!

03:24:22.436 --> 03:24:25.178
(cheers)

03:24:25.178 --> 03:24:34.422
MATT: You guys are amazing. So we're going to go
ahead and get her all the best legal work that we

03:24:34.422 --> 03:24:39.059
can to try and keep her in our midst. So thank you
guys so much for being generous and helping out

03:24:39.059 --> 03:24:44.764
with that tremendously. Tremendously. It means a
lot. Both to her and all of us here at Geek &amp;amp;

03:24:44.764 --> 03:24:53.426
Sundry so thank you. Thank you. Some of us-- I'll
be returning tomorrow at noon for Eric's TBD RPG.

03:24:53.426 --> 03:24:55.869
Doctor Who. Which will be fun.

03:24:55.869 --> 03:24:56.666
TALIESIN: Doctor Whom.

03:24:56.666 --> 03:25:00.088
MATT: With Darin De Paul. Doctor Whom. I'm sorry.
You're right. And then all of us will be here on

03:25:00.088 --> 03:25:02.275
Saturday for the 24-hour two-year anniversary
stream!

03:25:02.275 --> 03:25:03.295
LAURA: I don't know if all of us--

03:25:03.295 --> 03:25:04.241
TALIESIN: Many of us--

03:25:04.241 --> 03:25:06.243
MATT: Many of us, many of us will be here on
Saturday.

03:25:06.243 --> 03:25:09.889
MARISHA: Definitely Matt, Taliesin, and I, and
maybe others?

03:25:09.889 --> 03:25:12.925
TALIESIN: Hey, you don't have to DM the Mansions
for once!

03:25:12.925 --> 03:25:14.510
MATT: That's true, 'cause the new edition.

03:25:14.510 --> 03:25:15.745
TALIESIN: Now Apple will do it for you.

03:25:15.745 --> 03:25:21.282
MATT: It's wonderful. I was the Keeper almost
every time for years. Big surprise, right?

03:25:21.282 --> 03:25:25.184
MARISHA: Yeah, I've been the Keeper a couple of
times.

03:25:25.184 --> 03:25:27.291
MATT: You did! Which is why I said "most".

03:25:27.291 --> 03:25:28.333
MARISHA: A few, though.

03:25:28.333 --> 03:25:29.500
MATT: You were great. It was fun.

03:25:29.500 --> 03:25:31.961
TALIESIN: If we bring the expansion, you can still
be Ashcan Pete, too.

03:25:31.961 --> 03:25:33.883
MARISHA: (rough voice) Oh, hell, yeah. Who can?
Ashcan.

03:25:33.883 --> 03:25:34.797
TALIESIN: Ashcan Pete!

03:25:34.797 --> 03:25:35.882
MATT: Ashcan Pete. He's the best.

03:25:35.882 --> 03:25:37.134
TALIESIN: Your Ashcan Pete makes me happy.

03:25:37.134 --> 03:25:39.068
MATT: Anyway, guys, awesome work. Ashley, we love
having you.

03:25:39.068 --> 03:25:40.539
TRAVIS: Yeah, Ashley!

03:25:40.539 --> 03:25:42.930
MATT: Don't go back.

03:25:42.930 --> 03:25:44.048
ASHLEY: I know! I don't want to!

03:25:44.048 --> 03:25:45.185
TRAVIS: Stay!

03:25:45.185 --> 03:25:46.262
ASHLEY: I'm so close.

03:25:46.262 --> 03:25:47.303
MATT: Yeah, we get you back soon.

03:25:47.303 --> 03:25:51.136
ASHLEY: I have about three and a half to four
weeks. And then I'll be home for a long time.

03:25:51.136 --> 03:25:52.748
LAURA: Yay!

03:25:52.748 --> 03:25:56.258
MARISHA: Can you do the Skype-y things with us
next week? Do you know?

03:25:56.258 --> 03:25:57.344
SAM: Don't pressure her.

03:25:57.344 --> 03:25:58.439
TALIESIN: No, no pressure!

03:25:58.439 --> 03:26:00.788
MARISHA: I'm allowed. Because I care.

03:26:00.788 --> 03:26:05.554
ASHLEY: I don't know. I always hope so, but
sometimes that's proven to be a little bit more

03:26:05.554 --> 03:26:08.358
difficult for some reason this season.

03:26:08.358 --> 03:26:11.009
LAURA: It's because they made your part so big
this season.

03:26:11.009 --> 03:26:11.718
MARISHA: I know!

03:26:11.718 --> 03:26:12.786
ASHLEY: Well, doh doh doh.

03:26:12.786 --> 03:26:14.124
LAURA: You're so talented and amazing.

03:26:14.124 --> 03:26:15.274
TRAVIS: You're the best!

03:26:15.274 --> 03:26:16.615
LIAM: Stupid innate ability.

03:26:16.615 --> 03:26:21.439
ASHLEY: It's just-- No! It's just time change and
things.

03:26:21.439 --> 03:26:23.879
(all laugh)

03:26:23.879 --> 03:26:24.643
MATT: I know.

03:26:24.643 --> 03:26:25.640
ASHLEY: I love being here, though.

03:26:25.640 --> 03:26:26.527
MATT: I know. We miss you.

03:26:26.527 --> 03:26:27.424
ASHLEY: Soon! So soon!

03:26:27.424 --> 03:26:30.333
MATT: Soon. You'll be back soon. All right,
guys--

03:26:30.333 --> 03:26:33.386
LIAM: Do we have an EMT and a stomach pump on hand
for Sam? For after the show?

03:26:33.386 --> 03:26:34.509
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

03:26:34.509 --> 03:26:35.565
ASHLEY: How's your tummy?

03:26:35.565 --> 03:26:40.241
SAM: I ate a lot of sugar and caffeine at the
beginning of this show. I feel very strange.

03:26:40.241 --> 03:26:41.882
TALIESIN: There's Big League Chew on the floor.

03:26:41.882 --> 03:26:43.407
SAM: There is Big League Chew on the floor.

03:26:43.407 --> 03:26:44.525
TALIESIN: There's a little bit of Big League
Chew.

03:26:44.525 --> 03:26:46.105
LAURA: Ugh, gross!

03:26:46.105 --> 03:26:46.996
MATT: That is disgusting.

03:26:46.996 --> 03:26:48.106
SAM: And probably in my lower intestine.

03:26:48.106 --> 03:26:49.205
TALIESIN: Wait, wait. Wait.

03:26:49.205 --> 03:26:50.853
LAURA: Do not touch that, Taliesin.

03:26:50.853 --> 03:26:52.161
MARISHA: No, no, Taliesin! Oh!

03:26:52.161 --> 03:26:53.679
MATT: (laughs)

03:26:53.679 --> 03:26:58.752
MARISHA: I'm never eating Big League Chew again.

03:26:58.752 --> 03:27:01.202
TALIESIN: Good, then something positive has come
out of this.

03:27:01.202 --> 03:27:02.322
SAM: It was purple flavor.

03:27:02.322 --> 03:27:03.198
LAURA: Ew.

03:27:03.198 --> 03:27:04.277
MATT: Purple flavor?

03:27:04.277 --> 03:27:05.990
TALIESIN: That's not supposed to be purple.

03:27:05.990 --> 03:27:10.459
MATT: Guys, thank you so much. We'll see you next
week. Love to you all and is it Thursday yet?

03:27:10.459 --> 03:27:11.531
Good night, guys.
