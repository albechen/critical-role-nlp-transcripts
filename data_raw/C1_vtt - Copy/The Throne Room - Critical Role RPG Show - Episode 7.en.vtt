MATT: Hello, and welcome to this evening's episode
of Critical Role! We'll be with you in just a

00:00:04.494 --> 00:00:08.374
second. Unfortunately we're down a Travis
Willingham tonight, but in Grog's stead we have

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:13.673
the rest of the party venturing forth into the Emberhold after
just recently discovering Lady Kima. We shall see

00:00:13.673 --> 00:00:16.712
what happens very shortly, but in the meantime,
let's go ahead and

00:00:16.712 --> 00:00:19.613
give you guys some character backstory.

00:00:19.613 --> 00:01:28.077
[dramatic music]

00:01:28.077 --> 00:01:32.935
ASHLEY: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town,
near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family

00:01:32.935 --> 00:01:38.692
of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable
reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery

00:01:38.692 --> 00:01:44.684
left them with the curse of the last name
Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and

00:01:44.684 --> 00:01:49.754
redemption, had other plans for Pike's
great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his

00:01:49.754 --> 00:01:55.741
family at a young age after a dream, a dream that
changed the course of the Trickfoot family.

00:01:55.741 --> 00:02:01.526
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae, and pledged
from then on that him and his family would live a

00:02:01.526 --> 00:02:08.860
life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike
seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.314
animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had
a purpose in making things whole that had once

00:02:15.314 --> 00:02:21.350
been broken. She studied and learned the ways to
heal through divine magic. She lived a peaceful

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.826
life, quiet and simple, until one day Wilhand was
captured and almost killed by a group of goliath

00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:33.634
barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand
against the murder of the innocent gnome, and he

00:02:33.634 --> 00:02:40.600
himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead,
abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.730
help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best
she could, bringing him back to life. When he

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.610
awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw.
After that, they were the best of friends, a

00:02:55.679 --> 00:03:02.244
rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in
a few years' time Grog would soon return the favor

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:09.977
and bring her back from the clutches of death.
(roaring, crunch) After being killed in battle,

00:03:09.977 --> 00:03:16.349
Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that
it would never happen again. She spent four months

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.439
at sea, training with the men and women aboard a
ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:29.758
symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the
other, this time, Pike is ready.

00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:38.917
TRAVIS: Right, listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:46.625
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:57.624
combat, women, and ale. Wait... Easily the brains
of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast

00:03:57.624 --> 00:04:06.366
knowledge of shapes, colors, and shiny things.
Also ale. In his early years, armed with his

00:04:06.366 --> 00:04:12.101
two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving
his might amongst the ranks of his family's

00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:18.638
wandering herd. But after coming upon an
unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he

00:04:18.638 --> 00:04:26.543
objected to the killing of such an innocent life.
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for

00:04:26.543 --> 00:04:36.637
this terrified little thing. His disobedience cost
him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd

00:04:36.637 --> 00:04:44.941
leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and
left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then

00:04:44.941 --> 00:04:52.572
that the relative of the very gnome he fought to
save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome

00:04:52.572 --> 00:04:59.683
cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him
back from death's edge. And they have remained

00:04:59.683 --> 00:05:07.182
close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be
found challenging entire taverns to wrestling

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:17.292
matches! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest
house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale.

00:05:17.292 --> 00:05:22.507
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave
you with little information on the half-elven

00:05:22.507 --> 00:05:27.819
druid. You might even think that her social
awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is

00:05:27.876 --> 00:05:34.599
kind of sweet. Of course, it would be unwise to
underestimate her based on first impressions.

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:41.040
Under that unintimidating petite frame is a
vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.112
natural powers have made even the fiercest of
champions pee their pants. Literally. (laughs)

00:05:47.112 --> 00:05:53.294
Born to the Air tribe of the Ashari people,
Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and

00:05:53.294 --> 00:05:59.164
the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent
duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei,

00:05:59.164 --> 00:06:05.306
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed
with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she

00:06:05.306 --> 00:06:10.806
had quite a knack for air manipulation and
beast-shaping abilities. Well, if you consider

00:06:10.806 --> 00:06:18.127
kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts.
Which, I do. Anyways, it wasn't long before the

00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:23.952
headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren,
realized her true prodigious abilities and she was

00:06:23.952 --> 00:06:30.783
inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster.
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped

00:06:30.783 --> 00:06:36.099
and replaced with endless spell memorization,
teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:42.113
high expectations. Every druid leader to be must
embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes

00:06:42.113 --> 00:06:48.184
in order to introduce and establish respect
amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the

00:06:48.184 --> 00:06:54.600
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt
she was ready, he set her on the path to truly

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:01.202
discovering herself, not knowing when, or if she
will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain

00:07:01.202 --> 00:07:07.478
towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead.
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong

00:07:07.478 --> 00:07:14.417
warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and
compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one

00:07:14.417 --> 00:07:21.213
thought plays in repeat in her mind: is she even
worthy?

00:07:21.213 --> 00:07:26.771
TALIESIN: Percy was the third of seven
children, born to a noble family who lived far to

00:07:26.771 --> 00:07:32.073
the north, in the ancient castle of Whitestone.
With so many siblings to share the burdens of

00:07:32.073 --> 00:07:39.101
lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the
sciences, engineering and naturalism. One day, a

00:07:39.101 --> 00:07:44.819
mysterious couple, named Lord and Lady Briarwood,
came to court. During a feast held in their honor,

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:50.066
the Briarwoods violently took control of the
castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would

00:07:50.066 --> 00:07:56.253
stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the
dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister.

00:07:56.253 --> 00:08:03.421
Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men.
As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to

00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:09.267
the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually
jumping into a freezing river and floating

00:08:09.267 --> 00:08:15.220
unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking
up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:21.920
next two years, as he slowly made his way as far
south as possible. Then, one night, Percy had a

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:28.271
dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him
vengeance against those who destroyed his family.

00:08:28.271 --> 00:08:35.652
When he awoke, Percy began to design his first
gun. (gunshot)

00:08:35.652 --> 00:08:41.330
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:47.222
eye on you. A talented musician, master of
disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind,

00:08:47.222 --> 00:08:55.138
Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his
own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his

00:08:55.138 --> 00:09:00.812
endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for
coin and support his single mother. One day he was

00:09:00.812 --> 00:09:07.121
discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr.
Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe where he

00:09:07.121 --> 00:09:13.379
learned the ways of the world, and honed his
skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of

00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:17.843
his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms
with the violent death of his mother at the hands

00:09:17.843 --> 00:09:23.933
of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road
provided many, shall we say, educational

00:09:23.933 --> 00:09:30.064
experiences with the opposite sex, deep down
Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known:

00:09:30.064 --> 00:09:37.937
the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan
considers himself a lover first, performer second,

00:09:37.937 --> 00:09:44.180
and fighter distant third. On the battlefield,
he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:50.962
unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count
on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song,

00:09:50.962 --> 00:09:57.221
and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and
makes the females swoon.

00:09:57.221 --> 00:10:04.743
ORION: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius
Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

00:10:04.743 --> 00:10:10.907
located in the heart of Draconia, born from a
politically respected family. At the age of 15, I

00:10:10.907 --> 00:10:16.105
succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing
prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and

00:10:16.105 --> 00:10:20.653
the Draconian High Council were amazed at how
powerful my spells were for how long I had been

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:25.357
training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest
appointed member of the Magic Guild in Draconian

00:10:25.357 --> 00:10:31.518
history. For the next few years, I almost went mad
from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's

00:10:31.518 --> 00:10:38.134
rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a
chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room

00:10:38.134 --> 00:10:43.294
were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding
cities and areas around the known world. For

00:10:43.294 --> 00:10:48.467
months I would frequent the chamber, and learned
of artifacts from legend. After a long period of

00:10:48.467 --> 00:10:52.949
research, I made a list of artifacts that caught
my eye. I brought these findings to the high

00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:57.714
council and was told that all of the information
in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either

00:10:57.714 --> 00:11:03.580
believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries,
and hence were lost forever. I found those answers

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:09.370
to be unacceptable. A year later I devised a ruse
and managed to convince the city council to lend

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:14.597
support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of
peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms,

00:11:14.597 --> 00:11:19.584
going from town to town and making friends and
allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a

00:11:19.653 --> 00:11:25.581
red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands
in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed,

00:11:25.581 --> 00:11:31.505
so I could explore the world and find these
artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some

00:11:31.505 --> 00:11:37.321
may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock
to all that. I am much sharper than most give me

00:11:37.321 --> 00:11:42.866
credit for. I just don't pay attention to things
sometimes. I've also been known to be rather

00:11:42.866 --> 00:11:50.300
cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well,
dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:56.550
every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:01.830
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:08.241
skip past formality, preferring instead to invite
himself in your door. Along with twin sister

00:12:08.241 --> 00:12:15.460
Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter
between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.838
by their mother in their early years, the twins
were eventually sent off to their father in the

00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:25.833
elven capital of Syngorn, but their cool reception
among the elves there never warmed, and their time

00:12:25.833 --> 00:12:31.393
in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole
away one autumn night and set out on the open

00:12:31.393 --> 00:12:37.421
road. After a few years of wandering, they
eventually decided to return to their mother, and

00:12:37.421 --> 00:12:43.059
journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But
instead of finding their childhood home, they

00:12:43.059 --> 00:12:49.817
returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was
gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the

00:12:49.817 --> 00:12:59.217
townspeople for answers, they learned of the day
the dragon came. With their ties all severed,

00:12:59.217 --> 00:13:06.111
Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their
fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since

00:13:06.111 --> 00:13:12.601
birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's
challenges in his own particular way, often by

00:13:12.601 --> 00:13:20.562
sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for
circumventing adversity isn't enough, the way of

00:13:20.562 --> 00:13:25.880
blades the elves schooled him in more than makes
up the difference.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.747
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has
spent most of her life suffering the cool

00:13:30.747 --> 00:13:37.981
reception of a people who don't fully accept her.
Born of a human mother and an elven father who

00:13:37.981 --> 00:13:43.271
only later in life took an interest in their
existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother

00:13:43.271 --> 00:13:50.943
Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they
could truly rely on in this world were each other.

00:13:50.943 --> 00:13:56.230
It was at the age of ten when the two were taken
from their mother, and brought to live in Syngorn,

00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:03.110
the isolated elven city for which their father was
an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:09.753
kept an icy distance, and after too many years of
disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his

00:14:09.753 --> 00:14:17.760
indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax
took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:25.716
learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to
the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the

00:14:25.716 --> 00:14:32.874
keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track,
to spy and to shoot. And through a series of

00:14:32.874 --> 00:14:40.765
fateful events, earned herself a companion in the
form of a bear, her own stolen Trinket, to fight

00:14:40.765 --> 00:14:50.186
alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he
is adorable, and gives expert massages.

00:14:50.186 --> 00:15:57.413
[dramatic music]

00:15:57.474 --> 00:16:02.208
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back to the next
episode of Critical Role. We unfortunately are

00:16:02.208 --> 00:16:04.152
down one Grog this evening, as I mentioned
before.

00:16:04.152 --> 00:16:06.026
ALL: (distressed noises)

00:16:06.026 --> 00:16:11.999
MATT: We are missing him terribly. We'll see what
terrors will transpire in his absence. However,

00:16:11.999 --> 00:16:15.356
though! We do have some fun things to announce
real fast: first off, we're still giving away

00:16:15.356 --> 00:16:21.178
promo kits for every 50 subscribers we get, so
we'll be having those randomly drawn from everyone

00:16:21.178 --> 00:16:26.501
in the chat room every time 50 subscribers are
joined to the channel, I guess you would say.

00:16:26.501 --> 00:16:31.004
Also, every ten subscribers we're giving away
Steam keys for different games, so also cool

00:16:31.004 --> 00:16:38.135
giveaways, which is kind of fun. I want to take a
moment also to mention our... charity, there,

00:16:38.135 --> 00:16:40.186
that's the word I was looking for, it's been a
long day.

00:16:40.186 --> 00:16:41.301
(laughter)

00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:45.408
MATT: Our charity, 826LA, which we're putting up
links in the chat room for you guys if you're

00:16:45.408 --> 00:16:51.202
able to donate. It's a fantastic program that
tutors children, helps with creative writing and

00:16:51.202 --> 00:16:56.408
general literacy skills. It's a wonderful program,
you can look it up at 826LA, you should Google it,

00:16:56.408 --> 00:16:59.938
find the website, it has all the information you
need. It's a really great charity and we're still

00:16:59.938 --> 00:17:03.693
pushing that through our show every week, so thank
you for all who have donated, and if you have the

00:17:03.693 --> 00:17:10.749
opportunity to, I highly recommend it. Also! I
wanted to let you guys know we have-- Marisha

00:17:10.749 --> 00:17:15.157
wants to mention a cool sponsor tonight or at
least a promotional push we're pushing.

00:17:15.157 --> 00:17:20.439
MARISHA: Yes! Yes! Friends of the show, Espionage
Cosmetics, hooked us all up with some awesome

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:31.578
nerdy manicures. We'll tweet pictures of our
nails, so yes, we're all wearing awesome nails and

00:17:31.578 --> 00:17:37.811
we're going to be doing a giveaway from Espionage.
Their tabletop bath bombs,

00:17:37.811 --> 00:17:41.246
which are awesome d20s--

00:17:41.246 --> 00:17:42.888
MATT: d10s, technically.

00:17:42.888 --> 00:17:47.358
MARISHA: Oh, d10s-- No, there's a d20! There's a
d10 and there's a percentile die!

00:17:47.358 --> 00:17:50.570
MATT: No, you're right! I saw the wrong side of
it, my apologies. Forget I said anything.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:54.743
MARISHA: So yes, and we'll probably also go ahead
and throw in a Critical Role signed picture as

00:17:54.743 --> 00:18:00.622
well with this. What you have to do is tweet
@EspionageMakeup, is their twitter,

00:18:00.622 --> 00:18:07.669
@EspionageMakeup and #CriticalRole, and tell them
what your favorite character is from Critical Role

00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:13.840
and who your favorite nail wraps are today and then
we'll pick at half-time a winner.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.396
MATT: Indeed. So fantastic. I may have some more
stuff down the road we'll be able to talk about

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:21.682
but in the meantime, let's go ahead and get
everyone caught up to speed with what has transpired

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:28.313
recently on Critical Role. So the party, to give
you a quick overview for those who have just

00:18:28.313 --> 00:18:34.748
joined us, they were given a mission to seek out a
female halfling paladin named Lady Kima of Vord,

00:18:34.748 --> 00:18:39.666
who had been missing, going on a vision quest,
apparently seeking some deep, dark evil that had

00:18:39.666 --> 00:18:47.617
begun to simmer and grow beneath the dwarven city
of Kraghammer. The party managed to make their way

00:18:47.617 --> 00:18:53.025
to the city, delve deep within its caverns to
discover an entire series of caves, and what

00:18:53.025 --> 00:18:58.786
eventually led to the Underdark itself. A
subterranean landscape of terror and darkness.

00:18:58.786 --> 00:19:04.504
After a series of battles with some duergar, which
are kinda ashy-skinned evil dwarven offshoot

00:19:04.504 --> 00:19:11.721
people, characters, and a few brushes with some
illithids or mind flayer creatures, they managed

00:19:11.721 --> 00:19:17.589
to befriend one, or I should say, ally with one
named Clarota. Who has been traveling with them,

00:19:17.589 --> 00:19:22.898
who has apparently been kicked away from his
society and wishes reentry to save them from the

00:19:22.898 --> 00:19:34.082
kind of ominous presence of this unseen, barely
spoken entity called K'vorn. K'varn.

00:19:34.082 --> 00:19:35.223
(laughter)

00:19:35.223 --> 00:19:41.090
MATT: Long day. Long day. So upon traveling deep
into the recesses--

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.117
SAM: Don't worry Matt, you just have to talk
for three straight hours.

00:19:43.283 --> 00:19:44.506
MATT: (laughs) I know. I know.

00:19:44.506 --> 00:19:46.417
(laughter)

00:19:46.417 --> 00:19:48.105
MARISHA: Your day is just getting started.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.526
MATT: I know. But yes, so they have now, after a
series of battles, found their way into the

00:19:52.526 --> 00:20:00.372
magma-covered, kind of obsidian jagged caverns
where the Emberhold, the duergar fortress

00:20:00.372 --> 00:20:05.464
currently resides, where they believe Lady Kima
was. Upon finding a way in, unfortunately

00:20:05.464 --> 00:20:09.666
announcing their presence to the fortress itself,
they managed to find Lady Kima in a torture

00:20:09.666 --> 00:20:16.058
chamber beneath Emberhold, save her, slay her
oppressor, and now they have, after a tenuous

00:20:16.058 --> 00:20:20.680
alliance was made-- as Lady Kima and their
mind-flayer friend Clarota are very much at odds--

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.908
a very tenuous alliance was forged. And they now
journey back up to the main basement floor, or

00:20:25.908 --> 00:20:31.997
main base floor of the Emberhold proper. And
that's where we left off last time. So, hope you

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:34.264
can absorb all that, guys. (laughs)

00:20:34.264 --> 00:20:37.284
SAM: We are inside this fortress.

00:20:37.284 --> 00:20:38.487
MATT: Correct.

00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:41.491
SAM: We are moving towards the armory. We're
trying to find the armory or something,

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:42.636
is that right?

00:20:42.636 --> 00:20:47.789
MATT: You're trying to find, essentially-- Lady
Kima has mentioned she wants to find the rest of

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:53.953
her equipment that she says is either in an
armory, or she mentioned a vault. And also she

00:20:53.953 --> 00:21:02.576
knows-- she mentioned something about vengeance to
those who run the keep. So she stormed up.

00:21:02.576 --> 00:21:03.962
LAURA: We're following her, right?

00:21:03.962 --> 00:21:06.855
MATT: You've followed her back into the base floor
of the Emberhold itself. You all currently are now

00:21:06.855 --> 00:21:11.078
back kinda where you started after you snuck into
the side passage of the Emberhold.

00:21:11.078 --> 00:21:13.738
LAURA: And she said she would lead the way to the
vault?

00:21:13.738 --> 00:21:22.988
SAM: Can we be quiet for a second and see if
there's any footsteps around us or guards marching

00:21:22.988 --> 00:21:26.338
around? Are we in immediate peril or do we have a
second?

00:21:26.338 --> 00:21:28.486
MATT: Certainly. Everyone go ahead and make an
immediate perception roll.

00:21:28.486 --> 00:21:29.864
SAM: Okay.

00:21:29.864 --> 00:21:31.910
LAURA: So fast!

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:36.217
MARISHA: Website went live, if you want to
announce that now or later.

00:21:36.217 --> 00:21:39.722
MATT: Later. Two?

00:21:39.722 --> 00:21:40.963
LAURA: No, 22! (laughs)

00:21:40.963 --> 00:21:42.407
LIAM: 28.

00:21:42.407 --> 00:21:43.268
ASHLEY: 13.

00:21:43.268 --> 00:21:44.208
TALIESIN: 24.

00:21:44.208 --> 00:21:45.190
ORION: Fail.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:46.324
SAM: Ten. (laughs)

00:21:46.324 --> 00:21:50.464
MATT: That's a fail! All right, so-- You've got to
be ready!

00:21:50.527 --> 00:21:53.865
MARISHA: 27!

00:21:53.865 --> 00:21:54.968
MATT: Okay.

00:21:54.968 --> 00:21:56.689
(laughter)

00:21:56.689 --> 00:21:58.264
SAM: I'm sure he'll give you half of that.

00:21:58.264 --> 00:22:06.198
MATT: Nearly at the ready. All right, so as you
all take a moment and kind of steel yourselves,

00:22:06.198 --> 00:22:12.498
your ears perk up and you can hear what sounds
like echoes of distant footsteps down hallways,

00:22:12.498 --> 00:22:17.503
far out of sight. You hear some movement across
the stone ceiling above you that eventually comes

00:22:17.503 --> 00:22:23.525
to a stop. And you wait for about a minute, and
the entire place is now in a very eerie silence.

00:22:23.525 --> 00:22:27.221
LIAM: They know we're here, still.

00:22:27.221 --> 00:22:28.905
LAURA: But they don't know where we are.

00:22:28.905 --> 00:22:30.421
LIAM: No.

00:22:30.421 --> 00:22:32.525
ORION: Maybe they went to sleep?

00:22:32.525 --> 00:22:35.713
TALIESIN: Lady Kima, do you remember where the
vault is?

00:22:35.713 --> 00:22:38.531
Do you remember how we can get back there?

00:22:38.531 --> 00:22:42.270
MATT: Kima turns to you, her eyes still peering
back, and she's creeping towards the edge of the

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:47.260
hallway. She looks back at you, briefly, and says,
"I've only seen half of this stronghold before

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:53.230
"they captured me. As far as I know, probably
somewhere on the second floor."

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.441
LAURA: What floor are we on now?

00:22:55.441 --> 00:22:57.773
MATT: "The ground floor."

00:22:57.773 --> 00:22:59.177
LIAM: The ground floor.

00:22:59.177 --> 00:23:00.337
LAURA: Right, cool.

00:23:00.337 --> 00:23:01.806
ASHLEY: So it's just one up?

00:23:01.806 --> 00:23:03.021
(laughter)

00:23:03.021 --> 00:23:04.209
MATT: "Apparently."

00:23:04.209 --> 00:23:09.888
LIAM: Were there stairs-- When we went down that
set of stairs there, was there also stairs going

00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:12.203
up right there, or stairs going up?

00:23:12.203 --> 00:23:13.917
MATT: There were stairs-- Right there? No. There
were stairs going up

00:23:13.917 --> 00:23:15.411
in the first room you entered.

00:23:15.411 --> 00:23:17.337
LAURA: Oh, right! So we could go back in the
little storage room.

00:23:17.337 --> 00:23:18.640
LIAM: We could.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.871
LAURA: And go up.

00:23:19.871 --> 00:23:22.245
LIAM: We should just spend the next three hours in
the storage room.

00:23:22.245 --> 00:23:24.115
LAURA: Let's go in the storage room and go up.

00:23:24.115 --> 00:23:32.032
LIAM: Lady Kima, allow me to take a peek around
the corner, see what's going on.

00:23:32.032 --> 00:23:33.313
So I'm gonna go stealth.

00:23:33.313 --> 00:23:34.499
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll stealth.

00:23:34.499 --> 00:23:38.090
LIAM: And inch past her. That's good. 29.

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:45.443
MATT: 29? All right. She begrudgingly steps back.
You can see there's that eagerness to get in some

00:23:45.443 --> 00:23:50.278
sort of a fray or to feel somebody else bash along
the side of this greatsword that she borrowed from

00:23:50.278 --> 00:23:59.826
you guys. She lets you pass. You creep up along
the edge. As you do, you see-- back here there is,

00:23:59.826 --> 00:24:06.146
in the middle of this hallway, a series of
doorways, and what looks to be a large room in the

00:24:06.146 --> 00:24:09.939
center of the chamber where two duergar currently
stand.

00:24:09.939 --> 00:24:20.408
LIAM: I turn back to the group.

00:24:20.408 --> 00:24:23.408
TALIESIN: (whispers) How
about the other way?

00:24:23.408 --> 00:24:25.183
SAM: Why don't we just kill them?

00:24:25.249 --> 00:24:27.280
LIAM: Isn't that a corner-- a dead-on corner right
there?

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.666
MATT: This is another hallway.

00:24:28.666 --> 00:24:30.172
LIAM: Another hallway.

00:24:30.172 --> 00:24:34.995
SAM: Let's go kill the duergar.

00:24:34.995 --> 00:24:37.118
LAURA: How dark is it in here? Is it like--

00:24:37.118 --> 00:24:41.468
MATT: No. It's pretty dark in here. Like, with low
light vision, you're able to see maybe a good 30

00:24:41.468 --> 00:24:46.853
to 40 feet ahead of you. There are a few of those
red crystal clusters that give off a little bit of

00:24:46.853 --> 00:24:52.526
light, incrementally, but duergar themselves,
you've gotten to the point where you see they like

00:24:52.526 --> 00:24:56.669
it very, very dark. They actually aren't needing
light. This is more of a courtesy to guests they

00:24:56.669 --> 00:24:57.645
may have.

00:24:57.645 --> 00:25:01.455
LAURA: So potentially, brother, we could take them
both out if you throw your knife

00:25:01.455 --> 00:25:03.025
and I do an arrow.

00:25:03.025 --> 00:25:06.582
ORION: Wait, didn't we see further past that,
'cause that's where Grog did the--

00:25:06.637 --> 00:25:07.737
(crushing noise)

00:25:07.737 --> 00:25:09.163
SAM: No, this is the area that we haven't been in
yet.

00:25:09.163 --> 00:25:16.504
LIAM: I just put up a hand, and then slip around
this direction and slip down this second hallway

00:25:16.504 --> 00:25:17.987
that you revealed.

00:25:17.987 --> 00:25:23.551
MATT: All right. As you step past, you do see,
this room here is a little ajar; the inside looks

00:25:23.551 --> 00:25:27.612
to be a storage room. There's just a series of
boxes, barrels, and various--

00:25:27.612 --> 00:25:30.730
LAURA: (gasps) Maybe you can put yourself in a box
and walk around.

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.645
MARISHA: (gasps) Yes! Metal Gear Solid it!

00:25:33.645 --> 00:25:37.996
LIAM: I continue to creep away from my sister,
specifically.

00:25:37.996 --> 00:25:44.184
MATT: All right, you glare down the side of this
hallway. It leads to two other smaller rooms down

00:25:44.184 --> 00:25:48.768
the way, with a split towards the back end. There
does not appear to be anybody

00:25:48.768 --> 00:25:50.413
visible in that hall.

00:25:50.413 --> 00:25:51.915
LIAM: All right, I got this, I'm going to keep
going.

00:25:51.915 --> 00:25:53.165
SAM: Wait, what about us!?

00:25:53.165 --> 00:25:54.573
LAURA: Why are you doing this?

00:25:54.573 --> 00:25:58.005
MATT: All right, so you go past this way.

00:25:58.005 --> 00:26:07.438
SAM: Jesus. Two duergar, we can take them out in a
second!

00:26:07.438 --> 00:26:10.476
MATT: Now this hallway, there appears to be an
opening to this room, no doorway.

00:26:10.476 --> 00:26:12.825
LAURA: Everybody wait while my brother goes on a
field trip.

00:26:12.825 --> 00:26:15.249
MATT: And this additional room, you do not
currently see an entrance.

00:26:15.249 --> 00:26:16.818
LIAM: An opening that's not a doorway? Or--

00:26:16.818 --> 00:26:18.760
MATT: I mean, there isn't a door in the way, it's
just an opening.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:23.038
LIAM: The door is open. All right, so I'm going to
press against the wall, up to the edge, wait for

00:26:23.038 --> 00:26:27.853
five seconds, see if I can hear anything, and then
if not, curve around and peek in.

00:26:28.009 --> 00:26:31.407
MATT: Perception roll.

00:26:31.407 --> 00:26:35.096
LIAM: 20.

00:26:35.096 --> 00:26:41.953
MATT: 20. You take a moment and listen. You hear
what sounds like a light crackling of some sort of

00:26:41.953 --> 00:26:50.095
a fire? And the occasional dull ring of metal
being hit against metal.

00:26:50.095 --> 00:26:53.785
SAM: What was it? Metal against metal?

00:26:53.785 --> 00:27:00.548
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to get low to the ground,
and peek in the door.

00:27:00.548 --> 00:27:09.702
MATT: All right. Peeking through, you do see,
indeed, it is some sort of a smithy, with two

00:27:09.702 --> 00:27:15.265
kilns, or two anvils, set up, a work table in the
center, and there is one lone duergar that,

00:27:15.265 --> 00:27:19.619
apparently, in the middle of his work, has not
been paying attention to any of the ruckus going

00:27:19.619 --> 00:27:24.162
on around, and is just in the middle of hitting
some sort of long, thick piece of black iron, and

00:27:24.162 --> 00:27:28.503
it's just, (ting ting), sweat dripping down the
front of his brow, the room itself is-- even

00:27:28.503 --> 00:27:32.309
against the corner of the doorway, you can tell
the temperature is a lot warmer on the inside.

00:27:32.309 --> 00:27:33.988
LIAM: And his back is to me, currently?

00:27:33.988 --> 00:27:37.908
MATT: It's kinda to the side to you. He's
currently looking-- working out

00:27:37.908 --> 00:27:39.357
the anvil, banging down.

00:27:39.357 --> 00:27:40.345
LIAM: So this way?

00:27:40.345 --> 00:27:41.223
MATT: Yes.

00:27:41.223 --> 00:27:46.222
LIAM: Oh, but I see the door on the other side, so
I take the earring--

00:27:46.222 --> 00:27:48.045
SAM: Oh, why don't you just keep going forever?

00:27:48.045 --> 00:27:51.512
LIAM: -- take the earring and I whisper to my
sister, (whispers) follow along.

00:27:51.512 --> 00:27:54.820
LAURA: Oh. I've been invited on the field trip,
guys!

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:55.688
SAM: Just you?

00:27:55.688 --> 00:27:56.725
LAURA: Just me!

00:27:56.725 --> 00:27:57.779
SAM: Come on!

00:27:57.779 --> 00:27:59.055
LAURA: Who else can stealth?

00:27:59.055 --> 00:28:01.467
MARISHA: I'm a stealthy panther right now.

00:28:01.467 --> 00:28:08.848
LAURA: Do you wanna be something and pop in my
pocket? (laughs) That sounded wrong.

00:28:08.848 --> 00:28:11.138
MATT: You haven't had a short rest yet, and you
do--

00:28:11.138 --> 00:28:14.856
MARISHA: (clears throat) I was gonna say, I'm
still a cat form. But I can accompany you.

00:28:14.856 --> 00:28:18.676
LAURA: I should not go with you, I can't stealth
for shit right now.

00:28:18.676 --> 00:28:20.569
(laughter)

00:28:20.569 --> 00:28:22.641
LAURA: I rolled a seven.

00:28:22.641 --> 00:28:25.589
LIAM: (whispers) Send Scanlan up.

00:28:25.589 --> 00:28:26.960
LAURA: (whispers) Scanlan.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.012
SAM: Huh, what?

00:28:28.012 --> 00:28:29.507
LAURA: My brother's calling for you.

00:28:29.507 --> 00:28:33.334
MATT: You feel the oppressive force of Clarota's
voice in your heads simultaneously say,

00:28:33.334 --> 00:28:36.187
"I can also accompany."

00:28:36.187 --> 00:28:39.247
ASHLEY: Good plan. Good plan, Clarota.

00:28:39.247 --> 00:28:44.683
SAM: All right. I'll step ahead and go invisible.

00:28:44.683 --> 00:28:50.171
MATT: All right, so mark off your next
Invisibility spell. As you vanish, Clarota also

00:28:50.171 --> 00:28:55.004
kind of waves his hand for a moment, and his image
disappears the same way Scanlan's did.

00:28:55.004 --> 00:28:56.572
SAM: Ooh! He does that too?

00:28:56.572 --> 00:28:57.795
MATT: Apparently.

00:28:57.795 --> 00:28:58.771
LAURA: What did he do?

00:28:58.771 --> 00:29:08.794
SAM: He went invisible! (sings) We're walking down
a hall, nobody's watching us.

00:29:08.794 --> 00:29:10.443
(laughter)

00:29:10.443 --> 00:29:12.085
MATT: As you're humming to yourself--

00:29:12.085 --> 00:29:13.673
SAM: Oh no!

00:29:13.673 --> 00:29:19.952
MATT: You make your way down and eventually
towards the back of where

00:29:19.952 --> 00:29:22.567
Vax is pressed against the--

00:29:22.567 --> 00:29:25.246
LIAM: I can feel Scanlan's flute pressing into my
buttocks.

00:29:25.246 --> 00:29:26.860
SAM: That's not my flute!

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.571
(laughter)

00:29:28.571 --> 00:29:33.687
LIAM: So I turn to them, and then I start-- I pass
the door.

00:29:33.687 --> 00:29:35.073
MATT: Okay.

00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:37.663
LIAM: I'm gonna go around the corner to that other
door.

00:29:37.663 --> 00:29:38.816
MATT: All right.

00:29:38.816 --> 00:29:41.681
LIAM: And now I'm going to stab the duergar in the
neck.

00:29:41.681 --> 00:29:45.808
MATT: All right! Go ahead and roll for an attack!

00:29:45.808 --> 00:29:47.330
LIAM: Natural 20, natural 20!

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:48.757
(cheering)

00:29:48.757 --> 00:29:50.156
MATT: That's how you start the game.

00:29:50.156 --> 00:29:55.184
MARISHA: It's a good day! I feel like it's gonna
be a good day.

00:29:55.184 --> 00:30:01.645
MATT: All righty. So go ahead and roll damage.
This is a sneak attack, as he didn't-- it was not

00:30:01.645 --> 00:30:02.907
aware you were there.

00:30:02.907 --> 00:30:08.891
LIAM: I'll use my keen dagger, I think. Four plus
seven is-- This is a pencil, right? Okay, 11.

00:30:08.891 --> 00:30:11.064
Where-- how do you make it work? 11.

00:30:11.064 --> 00:30:12.163
MATT: All right.

00:30:12.163 --> 00:30:15.977
LIAM: Eight, 13--

00:30:15.977 --> 00:30:18.260
SAM: Get him in the neck so he can't yell.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.907
LIAM: Ooh. 66.

00:30:21.907 --> 00:30:25.696
MATT: You don't multiply the modifier. The
modifier goes on at the end. So it's the dice roll

00:30:25.749 --> 00:30:30.982
plus your sneak attack, multiplied by two, and
then the dex modifier at the end.

00:30:30.982 --> 00:30:34.281
MARISHA: That's a lot!

00:30:34.281 --> 00:30:35.405
LIAM: Okay.

00:30:35.405 --> 00:30:36.727
MATT: Plus seven, I think, right at the end.

00:30:36.727 --> 00:30:37.940
LIAM: Yeah, that's right.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.834
So it's the damage plus the sneak attack,
double that--

00:30:40.877 --> 00:30:42.501
MATT: And then add the plus seven at the end.

00:30:42.501 --> 00:30:45.499
LAURA: That's 28 times two plus seven.

00:30:45.499 --> 00:30:46.715
LIAM: 26.

00:30:46.715 --> 00:30:50.656
MATT: Splitting hairs here! That's enough. So.

00:30:50.656 --> 00:30:52.126
LIAM: One plus two plus two plus one.

00:30:52.126 --> 00:30:59.122
MATT: So you hear this, 'Tink! Tink! Tink!'
(pause) That's it. Without even a guttural noise,

00:30:59.122 --> 00:31:03.119
the dagger buries itself in the base of his skull.
You see him just (grunts)

00:31:03.119 --> 00:31:04.788
and slump down to the ground.

00:31:04.788 --> 00:31:11.263
LIAM: I catch the hammer and I start going 'Tink!
Tink! Tink!' And wave the two invisible beings

00:31:11.263 --> 00:31:12.390
into the room.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:13.737
ASHLEY: Hey! What happened in there?

00:31:13.737 --> 00:31:16.944
SAM: We're here! We're ready to fight. What do you
need us to do?

00:31:16.944 --> 00:31:23.700
MATT: Kima at this point-- You can see her hand
kind of tensing around the sword as she looks back

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:32.547
at Grog, whose hands are also wringing his
greataxe. "I want to kill something!" She kind of

00:31:32.547 --> 00:31:35.314
backs off to the side and sees the other duergar
that are there.

00:31:35.314 --> 00:31:36.777
ASHLEY: (Grog voice) I want to rage!

00:31:36.777 --> 00:31:39.303
MATT: And she's going to go ahead and run around.

00:31:39.303 --> 00:31:42.518
LIAM: Don't waste my natural 20, Kima. Come on!

00:31:42.518 --> 00:31:44.764
LAURA: Man, you can't control Kima!

00:31:44.764 --> 00:31:48.963
MARISHA: This is why we don't have AI in the
party, guys. You can't control the AI.

00:31:48.963 --> 00:31:56.320
MATT: You know you guys are telling a very, very
angry woman right now to be patient. Doesn't seem

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.664
to make a ruckus.

00:31:57.664 --> 00:32:03.292
LAURA: Can I sneak up to the corner at least, so I
can be ready to attack those two bastards?

00:32:03.292 --> 00:32:06.620
MATT: Over to here? All righty. Trinket, who
hasn't seen you in a while,

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.122
is sticking to your back.

00:32:08.122 --> 00:32:10.390
LAURA: I sit there and I kind of pet him as I look
around the corner.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:15.307
MATT: Okay. Trinket is enjoying the petting. All
right, so that duergar's down, the current armory

00:32:15.307 --> 00:32:21.160
section appears to be completely open and at your
disposal. There are a series of partially made

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:28.199
weapons kind of scattered in a pile. There are
some ingots, and even some raw iron material in

00:32:28.199 --> 00:32:32.660
the far corner. Other than that, it just looks
like your general smithing workshop.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.705
SAM: Is Kima with us now?

00:32:34.705 --> 00:32:38.378
MATT: Kima is currently looking around this
section with you guys.

00:32:38.378 --> 00:32:43.028
SAM: Kima, do you see any of your equipment here
that you wanted?

00:32:43.028 --> 00:32:48.525
MATT: She glances around, goes and move some of the
piles by, turning over the room as quietly as she

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:53.688
can-- not as quietly as you'd like-- but quiet
enough. "No. Nothing's here."

00:32:53.688 --> 00:32:57.731
SAM: Can't you just take one of these things and
call it a day?

00:32:57.731 --> 00:33:00.279
(laughter)

00:33:00.279 --> 00:33:02.672
MATT: She glares in the direction of your voice.

00:33:02.672 --> 00:33:03.854
SAM: I'm invisible, I--

00:33:03.854 --> 00:33:07.302
MATT: "This will do me just fine for now!"

00:33:07.302 --> 00:33:08.443
SAM: Oh!

00:33:08.443 --> 00:33:16.203
MATT: "Right. Let's keep looking." She leaves the
room. She starts heading down this way--

00:33:16.203 --> 00:33:18.704
LIAM: All right, I'm following after her,
tiptoeing after her.

00:33:18.704 --> 00:33:23.116
LAURA: We should go after her. 'Cause we're all
gonna split up.

00:33:23.116 --> 00:33:26.256
LIAM: Yeah, I speak into my earring and say zubba
zubba zubba zubba.

00:33:26.256 --> 00:33:30.380
LAURA: Let's all go in that back way and see if we
can stealth around.

00:33:30.422 --> 00:33:32.990
MATT: Okay. For everyone else, stealth
check.

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:34.050
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

00:33:34.092 --> 00:33:35.285
ASHLEY: Here we go!

00:33:35.285 --> 00:33:37.362
ORION: Yes! Natural 20!

00:33:37.362 --> 00:33:40.307
MATT: Disadvantage on you, Pike, because of your
heavy armor.

00:33:40.307 --> 00:33:42.010
ASHLEY: So that means I roll twice?

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:43.171
MATT: Roll twice, take the lower.

00:33:43.171 --> 00:33:44.407
ASHLEY: I take the lower one.

00:33:44.407 --> 00:33:51.488
ORION: Now as that happens, I want to cast Mage
Hand and I want to cast Light on it, and I want to

00:33:51.488 --> 00:33:53.755
slowly have it drift down there.

00:33:53.755 --> 00:33:56.895
MATT: They're both concentration spells. You can
have one or the other.

00:33:56.895 --> 00:33:58.430
ORION: Dagnabbit.

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:00.731
MATT: Mage Hand isn't an actual object,
unfortunately.

00:34:00.731 --> 00:34:10.599
ORION: Dagnabbit. Okay, fine. Instead I cast
Prestidigitation and I make a little glowy orb,

00:34:10.599 --> 00:34:15.465
and it's a little flickery, and I cast-- I think I
can maybe try, what, 15 feet?

00:34:15.465 --> 00:34:18.017
MATT: Okay. And where are you casting it? Just in
the middle of this hallway here?

00:34:18.017 --> 00:34:19.466
ORION: No. To my left.

00:34:19.466 --> 00:34:20.442
MATT: Here?

00:34:20.442 --> 00:34:21.754
SAM: He wants to see in the dark place.

00:34:21.754 --> 00:34:23.001
ORION: I wanna see in the dark place.

00:34:23.001 --> 00:34:29.064
MATT: There is no entrance to this room
currently from what you can see. It's just a wall.

00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:31.717
There is a door on the opposite side.

00:34:31.717 --> 00:34:33.724
SAM: Now it's a well-lit wall.

00:34:33.724 --> 00:34:37.339
ORION: Hm. All right, well, I follow after the
bear.

00:34:37.339 --> 00:34:38.661
(laughter)

00:34:38.661 --> 00:34:41.463
MATT: All right, so what was your stealth roll?

00:34:41.463 --> 00:34:42.516
LAURA: Oh, it was 17.

00:34:42.516 --> 00:34:44.847
MATT: 17. Roll for Trinket.

00:34:44.847 --> 00:34:46.047
LAURA: Oh gosh.

00:34:46.047 --> 00:34:47.476
SAM: (bear noises)

00:34:47.533 --> 00:34:49.677
LAURA: I thought he just got what I got. Crap.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.998
SAM: Not good.

00:34:51.998 --> 00:34:53.498
LAURA: What do I add to it?

00:34:53.498 --> 00:34:54.464
SAM: Nothing.

00:34:54.464 --> 00:34:55.952
MATT: Add his dex modifier. Trinket's dex
modifier.

00:34:55.952 --> 00:34:59.905
LAURA: Okay, hold on. Hold on. Oh, good.

00:34:59.905 --> 00:35:01.392
LIAM and LAURA: 11.

00:35:01.392 --> 00:35:08.886
MATT: All right, as you guys are making your way
down the hallway, slowly--

00:35:08.886 --> 00:35:12.411
LAURA: I kinda clamp my hand over his mouth and
tell him to shush.

00:35:12.411 --> 00:35:17.266
MATT: You guys make your way down here. One of the
duergar glances over--

00:35:17.266 --> 00:35:18.575
SAM: Oh boy.

00:35:18.575 --> 00:35:20.953
MATT: -- utters something to the friend at his
side and he goes--

00:35:21.034 --> 00:35:23.804
LIAM: I heard the bear and I start sliding my back
down along the wall.

00:35:23.804 --> 00:35:27.316
LAURA: Oh crap. I turn around and notch my arrow
for them.

00:35:27.316 --> 00:35:30.007
MATT: Okay, Trinket moves past

00:35:30.007 --> 00:35:33.005
TALIESIN: I walk up to the very, very edge of the
hallway.

00:35:33.005 --> 00:35:38.935
LIAM: And I'm stabbing! Stabbing, stabbing!
Stabbing.

00:35:38.999 --> 00:35:42.173
ORION: Matthew, behind the bear.

00:35:42.218 --> 00:35:44.071
MATT: You move behind the bear?

00:35:44.071 --> 00:35:45.024
ORION: Yes.

00:35:45.024 --> 00:35:46.975
MATT: You are right there and they both see you

00:35:46.975 --> 00:35:49.657
ORION: No, no, the other bear. I mean, the other
side of the bear.

00:35:49.657 --> 00:35:58.277
MATT: As you're walking behind Trinket, all this
transpires simultaneously. Right. And they saw the

00:35:58.438 --> 00:36:02.719
bear and then saw something move behind it. Their
attention was got. They see you and they start

00:36:02.719 --> 00:36:03.657
walking towards--

00:36:03.657 --> 00:36:05.008
LIAM: Stabbing duergars, stabbing duergars.

00:36:05.008 --> 00:36:08.269
MATT: However, as they pass there, you get one shot
at this guy as he passes past you. Go ahead and

00:36:08.314 --> 00:36:09.310
make your attack.

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:10.432
ORION: I wave at them.

00:36:10.432 --> 00:36:12.436
MATT: Okay. (laughs) Tiberius waves at them.

00:36:12.436 --> 00:36:14.120
MARISHA: I go ahead and move up next to Percy.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.670
ORION: Hello. I don't think they're our friends.

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:20.185
MATT: Unfortunately, the space is a little limited
for your size. You have to wait for the rest of

00:36:20.185 --> 00:36:21.421
them to let you by.

00:36:21.421 --> 00:36:27.409
MARISHA: Oh, but Grog's behind me. He's not here,
right? Where's Grog?

00:36:27.409 --> 00:36:29.735
MATT: You're a big cat right now.

00:36:29.735 --> 00:36:30.911
MARISHA: I'm a big kitty.

00:36:30.911 --> 00:36:32.143
LIAM: I rolled a 15.

00:36:32.143 --> 00:36:35.168
MATT: 15? 15 does barely hit.

00:36:35.168 --> 00:36:40.956
LIAM: Okay, so same keen dagger.

00:36:40.956 --> 00:36:44.067
MATT: As you go ahead, move around the corner and
fire. Two arrows?

00:36:44.067 --> 00:36:45.225
LAURA: 17.

00:36:45.225 --> 00:36:48.838
MATT: All right. Second one? Same guy or different
targets?

00:36:48.838 --> 00:36:54.446
LAURA: Same target. He's right in front. That one
hits too, that's 19.

00:36:54.446 --> 00:36:57.219
MATT: Both hit, go ahead and roll damage on both.

00:36:57.219 --> 00:36:58.491
LIAM: 32 for me.

00:36:58.491 --> 00:37:06.319
MATT: Okay. So as you watch them both walk past
you, one of them continues past with his hammer

00:37:06.319 --> 00:37:09.830
out, rushing towards whatever he sees moving at
the end of the hallway, probably Tiberius after

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:14.358
Trinket. The next one that comes past you, you
reach around and just take your dagger and swing

00:37:14.358 --> 00:37:19.089
it across the back of his neck area. You manage to
sever the base of the spine and he just crumples

00:37:19.089 --> 00:37:22.857
into a pile in front of you. The other one--
Damage?

00:37:22.857 --> 00:37:25.868
LAURA: 22 with the two arrows. Nine and 13.

00:37:25.868 --> 00:37:31.887
MATT: Both arrows impact his chest. The duergar
steps back for a second, surprised by the moment,

00:37:31.887 --> 00:37:36.376
looks really furious and begins to step forward,
his size enlarging.

00:37:36.376 --> 00:37:39.672
TALIESIN: I knock him right in the face with the
butt of my gun as he rounds the corner.

00:37:39.672 --> 00:37:44.827
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a stealth check
to see whether or not he sees you.

00:37:44.827 --> 00:37:46.688
TALIESIN: I can't use my previous stealth roll?

00:37:46.688 --> 00:37:49.673
MATT: Not for this point. This is an active
combat.

00:37:49.673 --> 00:37:51.869
TALIESIN: Damn it. Eight.

00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:56.845
MATT: Okay. So you still get the attack, but you
don't have advantage, 'cause he's aware you're

00:37:56.904 --> 00:38:00.519
there. As he's running past you, he glances and
sees you in the corner of his eye and is preparing

00:38:00.519 --> 00:38:02.868
for the blows. Go ahead and roll your attack.

00:38:02.868 --> 00:38:05.535
TALIESIN: What do I add to this, by the way? I've
never done a physical attack.

00:38:05.535 --> 00:38:10.440
MATT: You're hitting it with the blunt. Go ahead
and roll a d20 and

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.160
add your strength modifier and four.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:17.164
TALIESIN: All right. Natural 20!

00:38:17.164 --> 00:38:18.934
(cheering)

00:38:18.934 --> 00:38:20.288
MARISHA: Look, it's flashing!

00:38:20.288 --> 00:38:22.557
TALIESIN: It flashes if I hit a natural 20.

00:38:22.557 --> 00:38:28.902
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll damage. It
is a 1d4 plus your strength modifier.

00:38:28.902 --> 00:38:33.209
TALIESIN: So that would be 2d4 plus my strength
modifier, because it's a natural 20.

00:38:33.209 --> 00:38:34.796
MATT: Correct, yes.

00:38:34.796 --> 00:38:38.801
TALIESIN: That's six points of damage.

00:38:38.801 --> 00:38:41.038
MATT: Well, it's five on there, right?

00:38:41.038 --> 00:38:42.874
TALIESIN: My strength modifier is one.

00:38:42.874 --> 00:38:45.806
MATT: Okay, so that's five times two is ten plus
one. 11 points of damage.

00:38:45.806 --> 00:38:47.105
TALIESIN: 11 points of damage.

00:38:47.105 --> 00:38:50.951
MATT: Which will do it. As the duergar sees you,
is rushing past with his hammer, about to fall

00:38:51.138 --> 00:38:57.057
back and swing at you, you rush out from behind
the corner with the blunt end of your weapon and

00:38:57.057 --> 00:38:59.817
just whack him in the side of the temple.

00:38:59.817 --> 00:39:01.233
SAM: Girly scream.

00:39:01.233 --> 00:39:03.345
ORION: What was that?

00:39:03.345 --> 00:39:05.115
TALIESIN: (whispers) We're good, we're good.

00:39:05.115 --> 00:39:08.057
MATT: Unconscious on the ground. Alive but
unconscious.

00:39:08.057 --> 00:39:11.420
ASHLEY: He's not dead? Can I-- so he's at a
disadvantage, basically?

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.061
MATT: He's incapacitated.

00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:16.115
ASHLEY: So can I go up to him and slit his throat
with my mace of disruption?

00:39:16.115 --> 00:39:18.258
To make sure he's dead?

00:39:18.258 --> 00:39:19.222
MATT: If you'd like to?

00:39:19.252 --> 00:39:20.207
ASHLEY: Yes, I want to.

00:39:20.207 --> 00:39:21.397
MATT: Okay.

00:39:21.397 --> 00:39:23.245
ASHLEY: Is that really bad, though?

00:39:23.245 --> 00:39:26.783
MATT: Pike walks up and grabs the back of the
duergar's hair, holds it back and using the jagged

00:39:26.783 --> 00:39:32.258
edge of her mace of disruption, tears open the
throat of the duergar, which then spills all this

00:39:32.258 --> 00:39:33.924
blackish ichor across the ground.

00:39:33.995 --> 00:39:36.267
LIAM: She went renegade, folks. She's gone
renegade.

00:39:36.267 --> 00:39:38.714
ASHLEY: I just wanted to make sure he didn't come
after us.

00:39:38.714 --> 00:39:46.379
MATT: Grog looks impressed but also slightly
worried as the man who grew up alongside you. All

00:39:46.379 --> 00:39:48.851
right, so that happened.

00:39:48.851 --> 00:39:54.831
LIAM: And then she says, okay, I'm gonna dismember
the body. Hold on.

00:39:54.831 --> 00:39:56.667
(laughter)

00:39:56.667 --> 00:39:58.030
LAURA: Torture weapons.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:03.474
SAM: Because I'm invisible in the thing with Lady
Kima, I get up on a stool to see if I can catch

00:40:03.474 --> 00:40:04.911
some cleavage.

00:40:04.911 --> 00:40:06.311
(laughter)

00:40:06.311 --> 00:40:08.440
SAM: Just peek over, peek in.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:14.897
MATT: The leather armor that she wore is a full
torso-covering leather armor piece, I apologize.

00:40:14.897 --> 00:40:16.781
SAM: (sighs) I give up.

00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:27.869
MATT: Sorry, Scanlan. She is-- Yeah, which by the
way, I mean, it's not just so much the fact that

00:40:27.869 --> 00:40:33.224
Pike did it, it's the fact that Pike did it by
running a jagged, blade-edged mace across

00:40:33.224 --> 00:40:35.620
someone's throat. It was less of a slice and more of
a--

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.433
ASHLEY: Is Sarenrae gonna get really mad at me?

00:40:37.538 --> 00:40:38.406
MATT: We'll see.

00:40:38.406 --> 00:40:42.070
ASHLEY: They're really bad! If they're really bad
guys, they were super bad. The duergar are so bad.

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:43.385
She'd probably be happy--

00:40:43.385 --> 00:40:45.468
ORION: Right, Pike, but man, that was rough.

00:40:45.541 --> 00:40:46.533
MATT: We'll find out.

00:40:46.533 --> 00:40:48.598
TALIESIN: He had a little duergar back at home.

00:40:48.598 --> 00:40:53.040
MATT: So, given this case, now the rest of the
party is able to move forward. This hallway now,

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:58.423
you can only see about that far down with the
current light source. You can see Kima is now

00:40:58.423 --> 00:40:59.491
moving across--

00:40:59.491 --> 00:41:00.625
SAM: Aw, she's just going?

00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:02.280
LAURA: Go listen-- aw, she's still going that
direction?

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.082
LIAM: All right. I'm tiptoe-jogging behind Kima.

00:41:04.082 --> 00:41:07.834
MARISHA: Can we do something to slow her down?

00:41:07.834 --> 00:41:09.533
SAM: I can stop her if you want?

00:41:09.533 --> 00:41:11.529
MARISHA: Well, I mean, can we-- I mean, we don't
wanna stop her

00:41:11.529 --> 00:41:13.781
I just wanna be like, hey, slow, girl.

00:41:13.781 --> 00:41:16.285
LAURA: She's-- you know what? I bet she's pretty
noisy too!

00:41:16.285 --> 00:41:18.986
MATT: She's wearing leather armor, she's not very
noisy right now.

00:41:18.986 --> 00:41:24.672
LIAM: I carefully place a hand on Kima's shoulder,
and do a little, sort of, curtsy motion.

00:41:24.672 --> 00:41:26.783
Allow me, I can--

00:41:26.783 --> 00:41:31.537
MATT: Okay, as you do so she kinda stops and looks
back over her shoulder and gives a begrudging nod.

00:41:31.537 --> 00:41:35.836
But you can see she's-- there's shaking, her hand
holding the greatsword

00:41:35.836 --> 00:41:37.389
is currently shaking with rage.

00:41:37.389 --> 00:41:42.314
LIAM: I say-- (silent) Two words, three
syllables.

00:41:42.314 --> 00:41:43.812
(laughter)

00:41:43.812 --> 00:41:51.048
MATT: All right, so. Coasting down this hallway.
It leads down to an open doorway and a closed

00:41:51.048 --> 00:41:57.187
doorway immediately to your right. And then the
room to-- actually, the doorway's to your left,

00:41:57.187 --> 00:42:00.327
and to the right you see another wall to another
room that you don't have

00:42:00.327 --> 00:42:01.734
a doorway currently available.

00:42:01.734 --> 00:42:03.333
LIAM: There's a door to my left and a door
straight ahead, right?

00:42:03.333 --> 00:42:04.451
MATT: Correct.

00:42:04.451 --> 00:42:09.792
LIAM: Okay, I inch up to the closed door on the
left and place my ear to the door and listen.

00:42:09.792 --> 00:42:13.471
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a perception check.

00:42:13.471 --> 00:42:14.958
LIAM: Yeah, natural 20.

00:42:14.958 --> 00:42:16.186
MARISHA: What?!

00:42:16.186 --> 00:42:17.604
ASHLEY: Come on!

00:42:17.604 --> 00:42:19.112
SAM: Yeah. It's gonna be one of those nights.

00:42:19.112 --> 00:42:20.628
LAURA: I need that one! Oh my goodness.

00:42:20.628 --> 00:42:22.017
TALIESIN: Don't. Jinx it.

00:42:22.017 --> 00:42:25.667
MATT: I'm gon' kill all you.

00:42:25.667 --> 00:42:27.158
LAURA: No!

00:42:27.158 --> 00:42:28.672
(laughter)

00:42:28.672 --> 00:42:35.941
MATT: You put your ear to the side, and you hear
nothing.

00:42:35.941 --> 00:42:41.955
LIAM: Okay. Do I sense any kind of-- I'm checking
for traps on the door.

00:42:41.955 --> 00:42:44.179
MATT: Okay. Yup.

00:42:44.179 --> 00:42:49.460
LIAM: Trap's perception, right? 26.

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:55.769
MATT: So the door itself does not appear to be
trapped. It does appear to be locked, though.

00:42:55.769 --> 00:43:02.113
LIAM: All right, well, I pull out my picks. And I
get a three on that, so--

00:43:02.113 --> 00:43:04.432
MATT: That's okay. It's a really, really, really
crappy lock.

00:43:04.432 --> 00:43:05.459
LAURA: Oh!

00:43:05.459 --> 00:43:10.354
MATT: You notice that the door itself, it has a
locking mechanism on it. It was kinda half-locked,

00:43:10.416 --> 00:43:14.356
and as you push, it opens up, into a commode.

00:43:14.356 --> 00:43:16.289
LIAM: Aw, yes!

00:43:16.289 --> 00:43:22.594
MATT: There's nobody in there. It is a room with
what looks almost like a bench, with a series of

00:43:22.594 --> 00:43:24.621
holes cut into the bench. It's a communal--

00:43:24.621 --> 00:43:28.116
LIAM: Well, I'm tempted to close the door for a
moment, but I will press on instead.

00:43:28.116 --> 00:43:30.135
SAM: Check for loot!

00:43:30.135 --> 00:43:31.438
(laughter)

00:43:31.438 --> 00:43:32.973
LAURA: Gross!

00:43:32.973 --> 00:43:38.132
LIAM: All right, so I'm going to inch towards that
open door ahead of me, see what's around the

00:43:38.132 --> 00:43:39.115
corner.

00:43:39.115 --> 00:43:42.796
SAM: I'm gonna follow-- I'm gonna inch up behind
him as well. I'm still invisible, right? How long

00:43:42.796 --> 00:43:43.888
does that last?

00:43:43.888 --> 00:43:46.276
MATT: Okay. It's concentration for quite some
time, I believe.

00:43:46.276 --> 00:43:47.471
MARISHA: Actually--

00:43:47.471 --> 00:43:50.108
TALIESIN: Really quickly-- Oh, do you want to go
first?

00:43:50.108 --> 00:43:51.274
MARISHA: No, you go.

00:43:51.274 --> 00:43:54.240
TALIESIN: Does anyone want to hide these bodies
that we've just scattered about--

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.573
LAURA: Yeah, that would be good!

00:43:55.573 --> 00:43:57.278
MARISHA: Inside the loo.

00:43:57.278 --> 00:43:59.099
TALIESIN: It's a perfect place for them to be
interred.

00:43:59.099 --> 00:44:02.664
LIAM: So, Pike, hold still, please.

00:44:02.664 --> 00:44:04.076
ASHLEY: I'm not moving!

00:44:04.076 --> 00:44:05.894
SAM: Pike, eviscerate the bodies!

00:44:05.894 --> 00:44:12.120
MARISHA: Here, I'm gonna-- I'll walk over, in
tiger form, and I just grab one by the scruff and

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.111
start dragging it.

00:44:14.111 --> 00:44:18.812
MATT: Grog helps out. You guys move the two bodies
slowly over into the restroom area.

00:44:18.812 --> 00:44:23.235
MARISHA: Wait, we kinda prop them up to kinda like
Weekend at Bernie's them, yeah, make them just

00:44:23.235 --> 00:44:25.295
look like they're, you know, passed out.

00:44:25.295 --> 00:44:30.799
MATT: Okay, as they're both generally laying back,
like they just got really drunk and barely found

00:44:30.799 --> 00:44:31.866
their way to the toilet.

00:44:31.866 --> 00:44:33.069
SAM: And throats slit.

00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:34.471
(laughter)

00:44:34.471 --> 00:44:36.416
MATT: It's really rough blockage.

00:44:36.416 --> 00:44:40.614
MARISHA: We take that one and kind of like lean him
forward so you can't tell immediately.

00:44:40.614 --> 00:44:44.020
MATT: Okay. All right, that's not a worry. You
bring that up to that little area there.

00:44:44.094 --> 00:44:45.199
All right.

00:44:45.199 --> 00:44:47.035
LIAM: Well done, there.

00:44:47.035 --> 00:44:48.801
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you.

00:44:48.801 --> 00:44:52.463
MATT: You guys move forward to that. Grog has come
over here to be able to help. Now, looking down

00:44:52.463 --> 00:44:54.236
this hallway, here you can see--

00:44:54.236 --> 00:44:58.222
SAM: Who we got, who we got?

00:44:58.222 --> 00:45:00.970
MATT: This side opens up--

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:03.807
LAURA: All I want to do is find the damn treasure
room.

00:45:03.807 --> 00:45:11.577
MATT: Looking into this room, it appears to be a
barracks. A room that is just filled with

00:45:11.577 --> 00:45:13.620
different beds, all apparently empty.

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:15.949
LAURA: Oh, they're up and looking for us.

00:45:15.949 --> 00:45:17.648
MARISHA: &lt;i&gt;Apparently&lt;/i&gt; empty?

00:45:17.648 --> 00:45:19.171
MATT: From what you can see.

00:45:19.171 --> 00:45:26.323
MARISHA: Can I use my keen smell to see if I smell
any duergar in there?

00:45:26.323 --> 00:45:32.706
MATT: Sure. So you slowly approach the door using
your keen senses, which opens up this

00:45:32.706 --> 00:45:40.576
hallway a little bit visibly to you. You can see
it goes back quite a bit. Sniffing this room, you

00:45:40.576 --> 00:45:45.225
can tell that there were duergar there recently.
Apparently, at the moment, though, there is no

00:45:45.225 --> 00:45:51.687
immediate scent that matches a duergar. So the
room, for the most part, has been completely

00:45:51.687 --> 00:45:52.799
evacuated.

00:45:52.799 --> 00:45:58.689
MARISHA: Okay, I kinda-- even though I'm not a
dog, I'm a cat, I still kinda point. I go into

00:45:58.689 --> 00:46:02.322
pointer face. You know? Like--

00:46:02.322 --> 00:46:03.618
ORION: Pointer face?

00:46:03.618 --> 00:46:05.234
MARISHA: You know, like a pointer.

00:46:05.234 --> 00:46:06.932
LIAM: Yeah, angling your nose forward, all right.

00:46:06.932 --> 00:46:08.476
SAM: I think Keyleth has to pee.

00:46:08.476 --> 00:46:10.880
(laughter)

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.735
SAM: I never had a cat.

00:46:12.735 --> 00:46:17.200
LIAM: All right, I'm gonna start sliding down that
hall there, ignoring this other passage, and get

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:21.479
up to the door and again place my ear to it. Oh
look, there's the front entrance.

00:46:21.479 --> 00:46:26.743
MATT: As you look to your right, this is a large
foyer-type area with two red carpets that are

00:46:26.743 --> 00:46:31.345
rolled on the sides of it that lead to the front
of the main double-sided, large ten-foot-tall

00:46:31.345 --> 00:46:38.628
stone doors of the front of the fortress. To your
left, there is a double wooden door, about eight

00:46:38.628 --> 00:46:42.787
feet tall each side, about five feet wide, that
are currently closed, leading into whatever this

00:46:42.787 --> 00:46:44.986
large chamber is immediately to your left.

00:46:44.986 --> 00:46:47.563
SAM: Can I hang a right and go down that other
hall?

00:46:47.563 --> 00:46:49.283
TALIESIN: We should check out what's in that other
hall.

00:46:49.283 --> 00:46:50.442
SAM: Is there a door over there?

00:46:50.442 --> 00:46:52.096
MATT: There are two doors, actually.

00:46:52.096 --> 00:46:53.082
SAM: Closed?

00:46:53.082 --> 00:46:53.889
MATT: Both closed.

00:46:53.889 --> 00:46:55.488
SAM: I'm going to listen into those doors.

00:46:55.488 --> 00:46:56.974
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:46:56.974 --> 00:46:58.603
SAM: Natural 17.

00:46:58.603 --> 00:47:01.070
(cheering)

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:03.076
MARISHA: Gotta love that nat 17.

00:47:03.076 --> 00:47:08.374
MATT: Listening in, you don't hear any noise.

00:47:08.374 --> 00:47:10.685
SAM: That could mean nothing.

00:47:10.685 --> 00:47:12.039
LIAM: Are you at the double doors with me?

00:47:12.039 --> 00:47:13.765
SAM: I'm to the right. I went the other way.

00:47:13.765 --> 00:47:19.023
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to listen at the big
wooden doors, and I rolled, oh,

00:47:19.023 --> 00:47:21.467
not that great. 17.

00:47:21.467 --> 00:47:23.529
MATT: All right. Listening in--

00:47:23.529 --> 00:47:28.342
ORION: I scootch up ahead of Grog like, excuse me,
excuse me.

00:47:28.342 --> 00:47:37.133
MATT: As you listen back, there is no noise
internally, except for the slight squeak as you

00:47:37.133 --> 00:47:42.612
put yourself against the door. It shifts a little bit,
making no noticeable noise, but it appears the

00:47:42.612 --> 00:47:45.156
doors are unlocked, or there is no lock.

00:47:45.156 --> 00:47:46.791
LAURA: Oh no.

00:47:46.791 --> 00:47:50.040
MATT: You're not hearing anything from inside that
one door you're at.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:51.932
SAM: Wait, I just heard a noise?

00:47:51.932 --> 00:47:53.368
MATT: No, you hear no noise coming from that
room.

00:47:53.368 --> 00:47:59.279
SAM: Oh, okay. Stinking Cloud, can I go through
doors, or do I have to see what

00:47:59.279 --> 00:48:00.358
I'm casting it at?

00:48:00.358 --> 00:48:02.864
MATT: You have to have sight, unfortunately. I
mean, you could peek very low.

00:48:02.864 --> 00:48:05.535
SAM: I'm going to open the door and look.

00:48:05.535 --> 00:48:06.593
MATT: Okay.

00:48:06.593 --> 00:48:08.095
SAM: 'Cause why not?

00:48:08.095 --> 00:48:14.145
MATT: You open the door. It appears to be some
sort of a guest bedroom. It's a singular bed

00:48:14.145 --> 00:48:20.289
that's in much better condition than the barracks,
it's empty, it's well-made. It's more lit than the

00:48:20.352 --> 00:48:28.393
other rooms. It seems to be a room that's designed
for either non-duergar riff-raff or general

00:48:28.393 --> 00:48:34.026
soldiers or guests or people that would come to
the fortress to stay, so.

00:48:34.026 --> 00:48:35.442
SAM: Okay.

00:48:35.442 --> 00:48:41.996
LIAM: I'm going to try to peer into the door, and
I haven't talked about this before, but I'm wearing

00:48:41.996 --> 00:48:47.608
a cloak of elvenkind, which means I have advantage
on stealth, and enemies have disadvantage on

00:48:47.667 --> 00:48:50.278
spotting me, so I'm going to lean my head in.

00:48:50.278 --> 00:48:51.529
MATT: All right.

00:48:51.529 --> 00:48:53.215
LIAM: Do I need to roll for stealth or am I
already stealthed?

00:48:53.215 --> 00:48:56.963
MATT: For this, you're already stealthed. So as
you glance inside the room, you see what appears

00:48:56.963 --> 00:49:03.597
to be a great hall of some kind. There are large
wooden tables, there is a fire pit in the center

00:49:03.597 --> 00:49:08.181
that has a number of mostly burned wood that is
mainly just small darkened embers with a little

00:49:08.181 --> 00:49:13.990
bit of glowing yellow and red to it. There are
stools scattered about the room, you can see there

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:19.416
are remnants of some of a meal that hasn't been
fully cleaned up yet on some of the tables. But

00:49:19.416 --> 00:49:26.445
the room appears to be empty. You do see a slight
glimmer across the way on one of the tables.

00:49:26.445 --> 00:49:28.695
LIAM: Oh, I'm going to go check it out.

00:49:28.695 --> 00:49:30.229
LAURA: (whispers) Get the sparkly thing.

00:49:30.229 --> 00:49:33.199
MATT: All right. Everyone else, what are you
doing?

00:49:33.199 --> 00:49:37.799
SAM: Can I look around the guest bedroom? Just
kinda snoop around up in things?

00:49:37.799 --> 00:49:42.516
LAURA: Can I ask him, I'm asking you what you see
in there. What do you see in there?

00:49:42.516 --> 00:49:44.204
LIAM: I don't know yet, hold on

00:49:44.204 --> 00:49:45.384
LAURA: Is it sparkly?

00:49:45.384 --> 00:49:47.490
LIAM: I'm going to try to sense for traps in this
room.

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:48.483
MATT: Okay.

00:49:48.483 --> 00:49:50.348
MARISHA: I'm going to snoop in the barracks.

00:49:50.348 --> 00:49:51.860
MATT: Snoop in the barracks.

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:53.093
LIAM: 14.

00:49:53.093 --> 00:49:58.951
ORION: I'm going to make my way around all this
riff-raff, uh, no, uh, yes.

00:49:58.951 --> 00:50:03.306
MATT: You push your way through. "Excuse me,
excuse me, pardon me." Pushing through everybody.

00:50:03.306 --> 00:50:10.703
ORION: I'm going to go past where Vax is in the
room down that hallway, then I'm going to do my

00:50:10.703 --> 00:50:15.780
Mage Hand thingy again. Oh, my Prestidigitation.

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:16.995
MATT: Down this hallway?

00:50:16.995 --> 00:50:17.931
ORION: Mm-hm.

00:50:17.931 --> 00:50:18.748
MATT: Okay.

00:50:18.748 --> 00:50:20.734
ORION: Slowly, five feet by five feet.

00:50:20.734 --> 00:50:27.094
MATT: All right. You see slowly, as you move down
this hallway to check it out, a secondary set of

00:50:27.094 --> 00:50:29.029
barracks that are also apparently empty.

00:50:29.029 --> 00:50:34.696
LAURA: Where are they? The stairs are up in the storage
room, man. That's where we just were.

00:50:34.857 --> 00:50:40.514
MATT: You see a secondary commode that is open. And
as you glance around the corner as the light

00:50:40.534 --> 00:50:44.616
passes by you see there are two duergar currently
coming down the hallway this direction.

00:50:44.616 --> 00:50:45.616
MARISHA: Oh shit!

00:50:45.616 --> 00:50:48.175
ORION: I just stop! And I creep back.

00:50:48.175 --> 00:50:54.711
MATT: Okay. As you creep back, you hear footsteps
coming your way quickly.

00:50:54.711 --> 00:50:59.083
LIAM: I'm going to the door, then, I can hear
that. Inside the door, inside the door.

00:50:59.083 --> 00:51:00.481
MATT: Oh, inside the door there?

00:51:00.481 --> 00:51:04.075
MARISHA: I'm going to stay actually right there,
just right at the threshold.

00:51:04.075 --> 00:51:05.669
MATT: Okay. The rest of you guys?

00:51:05.669 --> 00:51:10.361
LAURA: I mean, I'm so far away. I can try to get
up there but--

00:51:10.361 --> 00:51:14.673
MATT: You can glance, there's still a hallway
around that way if you wanted to go around.

00:51:14.673 --> 00:51:16.277
LAURA: Okay. I'll go around the back way then.

00:51:16.277 --> 00:51:17.323
MATT: Okay, so you move around--

00:51:17.323 --> 00:51:18.518
LAURA: With Trinket!

00:51:18.518 --> 00:51:22.825
MATT: Trinket follows up behind. Makes your way up
there. Scanlan, you staying in that room?

00:51:22.825 --> 00:51:25.367
SAM: I'm taking a dump on the guest bed.

00:51:25.367 --> 00:51:28.974
(laughter)

00:51:28.974 --> 00:51:30.577
ORION: They don't see me, right?

00:51:30.577 --> 00:51:34.076
LAURA: I like walk by the door and see that
happening

00:51:34.076 --> 00:51:35.871
(laughter)

00:51:35.871 --> 00:51:38.396
SAM: But also just covering it up with a blanket
afterwards.

00:51:38.396 --> 00:51:41.424
MATT: Okay, well, you're in mid-process, this is
all happening very quickly.

00:51:41.662 --> 00:51:42.877
SAM: Oh. (grunts)

00:51:42.877 --> 00:51:47.792
ASHLEY: I'll go around back behind where Trinket
and Vex just went.

00:51:47.792 --> 00:51:51.741
MATT: Okay. Because of your little legs you get
about that far. Your little legs carry you.

00:51:51.741 --> 00:51:53.681
SAM: I'm invisible. It's poop.

00:51:53.681 --> 00:51:55.597
(laughter)

00:51:55.597 --> 00:51:56.949
MATT: (sighs)

00:51:56.949 --> 00:52:00.342
(grunting and laughter)

00:52:00.342 --> 00:52:02.283
MARISHA: It's apparating poo.

00:52:02.283 --> 00:52:05.834
TALIESIN: I'm staying in the hallway,

00:52:06.003 --> 00:52:08.461
SAM: Scanlan's just like, I hate this mission.

00:52:08.461 --> 00:52:13.409
MATT: Okay, so. Tiberius, as you're backing up,
both the duergar turn around immediately, seeing

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:18.852
you, and rear back with javelins, throwing them
directly at you.

00:52:18.852 --> 00:52:22.819
ORION: Oh! I'll cast Blur instead.

00:52:22.819 --> 00:52:25.884
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll initiative real fast
to see who gets off first what.

00:52:25.884 --> 00:52:30.103
ORION: I'm not going to count that. Oh, I'll count
that. 19.

00:52:30.165 --> 00:52:32.622
(laughter)

00:52:32.674 --> 00:52:34.277
MATT: What, why didn't you count it?

00:52:34.277 --> 00:52:36.346
ORION: Because it flew out of my hand, I didn't
roll it.

00:52:36.346 --> 00:52:37.591
MATT: Okay. All right.

00:52:37.591 --> 00:52:38.675
ORION: Yeah.

00:52:38.675 --> 00:52:40.363
(laughter)

00:52:40.522 --> 00:52:42.231
ORION: It's on camera, tell them to play back.

00:52:42.231 --> 00:52:45.422
MATT: So you go ahead and cast Blur. You guys see
as Tiberius comes running back, (startled sounds).

00:52:45.422 --> 00:52:48.578
He manages to cast a spell really fast as two
javelins come flying towards him. His visible

00:52:48.578 --> 00:52:54.098
image begins to actually blur; the outline looks
almost like there's two mirror images of Tiberius

00:52:54.098 --> 00:52:57.234
in the same place that are both shimmering and
preventing them from actually telling where he's

00:52:57.234 --> 00:53:03.960
actually standing. The first javelin comes in at a
14.

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.376
ORION: Nope.

00:53:05.376 --> 00:53:06.961
MATT: Second one comes in at a 17.

00:53:06.961 --> 00:53:09.303
ORION: 17. Yes.

00:53:09.303 --> 00:53:13.945
MATT: Oh sorry, no, it's a four, 'cause it has
disadvantage. So both javelins just whish past.

00:53:13.945 --> 00:53:17.702
Looks like they pierced part of that kinda
shimmering blurring form, but both just ricochet

00:53:17.702 --> 00:53:22.977
off the walls of stone and come clattering to the
ground. Kinda near back where Kima and Grog are.

00:53:22.977 --> 00:53:24.852
They both step out of the way as they land.

00:53:24.852 --> 00:53:25.815
MARISHA: Ha-ha.

00:53:25.815 --> 00:53:29.454
MATT: All right, so that brings us to-- that was
your action. Who else wants

00:53:29.454 --> 00:53:30.923
to take the next action?

00:53:30.923 --> 00:53:32.187
LIAM: I'm gonna hold.

00:53:32.187 --> 00:53:34.784
LAURA: I can't see anything, can I, from where I
am?

00:53:34.784 --> 00:53:36.528
MATT: It's kinda dark, and you can see movement in
the distance.

00:53:36.528 --> 00:53:38.772
LAURA: Can I hop on Trinket's back and see if I
can see higher?

00:53:38.772 --> 00:53:43.117
MATT: You can try. All right. So you hop on the
back of Trinket, (laughs) looking over the top,

00:53:43.117 --> 00:53:46.376
and you know Grog is kinda blocking part of your
view, but you can see, with your low-light vision,

00:53:46.376 --> 00:53:52.995
what looks to be Tiberius' form shimmering and two
duergar-height individuals that are partially

00:53:52.995 --> 00:53:58.024
blocked by him. So they do have partial cover, or
three-quarters cover. Do you have the feat that

00:53:58.024 --> 00:53:59.118
ignores that?

00:53:59.118 --> 00:54:02.253
LAURA: I don't know? I don't know.

00:54:02.253 --> 00:54:06.335
MATT: (laughs) Because you don't know I'm going to
say no.

00:54:06.335 --> 00:54:07.791
TALIESIN: It would be called Sharpshooter.

00:54:07.791 --> 00:54:09.183
MATT: Yeah it would be called Sharpshooter, is the
feat.

00:54:09.183 --> 00:54:10.378
LAURA: No, I don't have that.

00:54:10.378 --> 00:54:16.834
MATT: Okay, yeah. So go ahead and roll for attack
on one or both duergar, up to you.

00:54:16.834 --> 00:54:21.293
LAURA: 21.

00:54:21.293 --> 00:54:22.457
MATT: Okay.

00:54:22.457 --> 00:54:24.980
LAURA: And 23.

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:31.159
MATT: Okay. The 21 misses, the 23 hits. Because
they have cover and because it's so dark it's

00:54:31.159 --> 00:54:33.850
difficult to make out their form, but you do
manage to hit one with the arrow.

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:35.469
LAURA: Okay. I Hunter's Mark him.

00:54:35.469 --> 00:54:40.343
MATT: Okay. Next time, make sure you do that
before you attack. Otherwise it won't count for

00:54:40.343 --> 00:54:41.564
the attack.

00:54:41.564 --> 00:54:52.595
LAURA: Okay. Okay. 13, uh, 12! (laughs) Math! Stay
in school.

00:54:52.595 --> 00:54:56.665
MATT: (laughs) All right. There you go. 12, then
add your Hunter's Mark bonus to that as well.

00:54:56.665 --> 00:54:57.931
LAURA: Oh, good, one.

00:54:57.931 --> 00:55:01.560
MATT: All right, gotcha. So one arrow sinks in the
shoulder, but doesn't appear to be stopping his

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:07.702
angry advance towards Tiberius. Let's see. You're
staying where you are?

00:55:07.702 --> 00:55:08.812
LIAM: Waiting.

00:55:08.812 --> 00:55:12.405
MATT: All right. You guys are actually kind of
like pinched off in the hallway right here, so as

00:55:12.478 --> 00:55:13.816
you guys are all kind of--

00:55:13.816 --> 00:55:15.704
SAM: (strained) Don't say 'pinched off' to me.

00:55:15.704 --> 00:55:17.158
(laughter)

00:55:17.158 --> 00:55:20.860
MATT: -- as you're doing this, Tiberius, you're
right there. The two duergar catch up to you and

00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:24.040
both, now that their javelins are out of their
hands, pull out their hammers with their bonus

00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.792
actions and come down at you with an attack each.

00:55:26.792 --> 00:55:29.699
MARISHA: Run, Tiberius!

00:55:29.699 --> 00:55:31.344
MATT: That's gonna be a six.

00:55:31.344 --> 00:55:32.412
ORION: No.

00:55:32.412 --> 00:55:34.024
MATT: And a 17.

00:55:34.024 --> 00:55:35.567
ORION: 17 hits.

00:55:35.567 --> 00:55:40.576
MATT: Okay, yeah, that Blur is saving you, man.
All right, so as the one-- both the duergar are

00:55:40.576 --> 00:55:43.641
kinda like swelling with frustration, anger. It's
an ability, you've now gotten to the point where

00:55:43.641 --> 00:55:47.117
you can see, these duergar can actually
temporarily increase their form for stronger blows

00:55:47.117 --> 00:55:53.678
and attacks. Comes and strikes you for 12 points
of bludgeoning damage as the hammer comes cracking

00:55:53.678 --> 00:55:58.248
down, finding purchase on your torso, and it kinda
pushes you back a few inches. That's gonna bruise

00:55:58.248 --> 00:55:59.439
tomorrow morning.

00:55:59.439 --> 00:56:05.824
MARISHA: Can I do a combo move with Grog, assuming
that he would agree with me that it's gonna be

00:56:05.824 --> 00:56:06.903
super cool?

00:56:06.903 --> 00:56:08.727
MATT: He'd probably agree with you, what do you
wanna do?

00:56:08.727 --> 00:56:17.616
MARISHA: Okay. (laughs) Thanks, Grog! So since
Grog's kind of there-- Can we arrange like a

00:56:17.616 --> 00:56:26.872
fastball special, almost? So have him like kind of
go up and crouch and I'm gonna bust out--

00:56:26.872 --> 00:56:29.492
MATT: How are you going to communicate this to
Grog?

00:56:29.492 --> 00:56:31.357
MARISHA: He-- with--

00:56:31.357 --> 00:56:32.436
LIAM: (meows)

00:56:32.436 --> 00:56:35.033
(laughter)

00:56:35.054 --> 00:56:38.053
MATT: I'm gonna have to say, unfortunately, that's
not gonna work out for this moment. Grog's

00:56:38.053 --> 00:56:40.939
attention is on the duergar and you are a giant
cat.

00:56:40.939 --> 00:56:43.296
LIAM: Hey, I'm gonna sneak behind Tiberius and
stab that guy.

00:56:43.296 --> 00:56:45.249
LAURA: It would've been so cool, though.

00:56:45.249 --> 00:56:46.826
ASHLEY: That would've been really cool.

00:56:46.826 --> 00:56:53.251
LIAM: And since Tiberius is there, I can get sneak
attack damage, 'cause one of my allies is there--

00:56:53.251 --> 00:56:56.210
MATT: All right, just a second there, you're still
holding, let's finish Keyleth. So Keyleth, what

00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:57.373
are you doing?

00:56:57.373 --> 00:56:59.961
MARISHA: Well, is Grog in my way?

00:56:59.961 --> 00:57:02.575
MATT: Grog is there. You can attempt to leap over
Grog.

00:57:02.575 --> 00:57:06.734
MARISHA: I was wanting to vault off Grog's back,
is what I was wanting to do.

00:57:06.734 --> 00:57:08.214
MATT: You can do that without asking him.

00:57:08.214 --> 00:57:09.470
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I was going to do.

00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:11.347
MATT: No, you were saying you wanted to tell Grog
you were going to do that. But yes, you can still

00:57:11.347 --> 00:57:13.042
do it. So go ahead and roll an acrobatics check.

00:57:13.042 --> 00:57:14.945
MARISHA: No, you asked how I was communicating
it.

00:57:14.945 --> 00:57:16.804
LAURA: Just do it, Keyleth!

00:57:16.804 --> 00:57:23.131
MARISHA: So I'm gonna come out and I'm gonna vault
off his back and try and do a pounce over top of

00:57:23.131 --> 00:57:28.316
Tiberius for that duergar that's closest to you.
What am I rolling?

00:57:28.316 --> 00:57:29.187
TALIESIN: Acrobatics.

00:57:29.187 --> 00:57:30.722
MARISHA: Acrobatics? Is this an acrobatics thing?

00:57:30.722 --> 00:57:34.499
MATT: Yes. From around the corner, you pull back,
leap up, jump onto Grog's back and attempt to

00:57:34.499 --> 00:57:35.931
spring off of it.

00:57:35.931 --> 00:57:37.135
MARISHA: 11.

00:57:37.135 --> 00:57:47.474
MATT: 11, okay. (laughs) All right. So you jump
off of Grog's back. Grog, not expecting it,

00:57:47.474 --> 00:57:52.638
instinctively ducks down and the force you push
off, as he's not aware there's going to be a giant

00:57:52.638 --> 00:57:53.560
cat there--

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:54.927
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

00:57:54.973 --> 00:57:57.748
MATT: -- in doing so, it doesn't give you the
momentum you need. You are able to jump over him

00:57:57.748 --> 00:58:01.485
and get kind of into center of the fray. But you
do not have the pounce attack, unfortunately.

00:58:01.485 --> 00:58:02.948
MARISHA: Okay. That's fine.

00:58:02.948 --> 00:58:04.464
MATT: But it gets you there, at least.

00:58:04.464 --> 00:58:06.103
MARISHA: Oh, can I not attack?

00:58:06.103 --> 00:58:07.368
MATT: You can attack, yeah.

00:58:07.368 --> 00:58:11.494
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. I'm gonna go ahead and
do my bite attack.

00:58:11.494 --> 00:58:12.522
MATT: Go for it.

00:58:12.522 --> 00:58:15.611
MARISHA: I'm gonna go right for his throat. Still
with the same intention that I had in mind.

00:58:15.611 --> 00:58:17.921
MATT: Okay, this is the one that took the arrow
from Laura.

00:58:17.921 --> 00:58:19.267
MARISHA: Okay, 17.

00:58:19.267 --> 00:58:21.859
MATT: 17? That hits. Go ahead and roll for damage.

00:58:21.859 --> 00:58:28.968
MARISHA: 1d10 plus five. Where's my d10s? Ten
damage. Piercing damage.

00:58:28.968 --> 00:58:33.740
MATT: Ten piercing damage, all right. So, as you
rush forward, you bite at him. You see he pulls

00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:37.427
back, but you get a big, meaty chunk of his
forearm and clamp down, and you feel a snap, some

00:58:37.427 --> 00:58:41.111
sort of bone in the middle of his arm and he gives
out a horrible-- (yells) sound, as he takes the

00:58:41.111 --> 00:58:45.212
butt of his hammer and hits you on the snout.
Doesn't do any damage, but it's enough to get you

00:58:45.212 --> 00:58:49.663
to kind of let go of your grip a little bit, and
he rips his arm out of your jaws. Leaving that

00:58:49.663 --> 00:58:53.616
kind of nasty, irony taste of duergar blood, that
you've now become accustomed to, unfortunately.

00:58:53.616 --> 00:58:58.632
That ends the round. Now you have Tiberius and a
cat in your way.

00:58:58.632 --> 00:58:59.985
MARISHA: (meows)

00:58:59.985 --> 00:59:01.730
LIAM: Do the doors go in or out, that I'm by?

00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:02.738
MATT: The doors go in.

00:59:02.738 --> 00:59:05.837
LIAM: In. So I'm just gonna go like this (hinges
creak) and throw a dagger and say peek-a-boo at

00:59:05.837 --> 00:59:07.004
the same time.

00:59:07.004 --> 00:59:08.086
(laughter)

00:59:08.086 --> 00:59:09.870
MATT: Okay. As you step out (fwip).

00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:12.176
LIAM: That is a 29 to hit.

00:59:12.176 --> 00:59:13.258
MATT: That does hit.

00:59:13.258 --> 00:59:14.188
LIAM: Okay.

00:59:14.188 --> 00:59:16.280
MATT: You do not get sneak attack bonus,
unfortunately.

00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:20.565
LIAM: Even though my ally is five feet away from
him? I thought I remembered that rule.

00:59:20.565 --> 00:59:22.254
MATT: You do if you are in melee with them.

00:59:22.254 --> 00:59:23.676
LAURA: Oh, right.

00:59:23.676 --> 00:59:25.975
MATT: You get the bonus if you're both like
flanking them, or you're like harrying them in

00:59:25.975 --> 00:59:27.953
combat. Because you're at a distance, you don't
get the bonus.

00:59:27.953 --> 00:59:32.482
LIAM: Okay, so that is a nine. And then I'm going
to follow-- the nine of damage.

00:59:32.482 --> 00:59:33.486
MATT: All right.

00:59:33.486 --> 00:59:35.777
LIAM: And immediately follow up with my other
dagger, which also hits.

00:59:35.777 --> 00:59:39.572
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage on the
second dagger. Which is 1d4 plus what?

00:59:39.572 --> 00:59:41.836
LIAM: Six. That's a nine.

00:59:41.836 --> 00:59:50.048
MATT: Nine, okay. So, after the guy rips his arm
out of Keyleth's face, essentially, a dagger comes

00:59:50.212 --> 00:59:53.387
swinging out from behind the doorway, stabs him in
the other shoulder. You see he looks down at it

00:59:53.387 --> 00:59:57.520
confused for a second, and as that dagger vanishes
in a puff of dark smoke, returning to your-- the

00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:01.309
side of your hilt, he looks up just in time to see
the second dagger catch him right in the middle of

01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:05.844
the forehead, and he just falls onto his back at
that point, unmoving. That duergar is stripped.

01:00:05.904 --> 01:00:07.106
LAURA: What-what!

01:00:07.106 --> 01:00:12.223
MATT: Who's up next? Who wants to do anything? Who
hasn't done anything yet this action?

01:00:12.288 --> 01:00:15.017
SAM: Is there is a door next to me for another
room?

01:00:15.079 --> 01:00:16.154
MATT: You're just finishing.

01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:17.309
SAM: Oh, I'm just finishing, okay.

01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:19.775
MATT: Sorry. So, Pike, have you done anything
yet?

01:00:19.775 --> 01:00:22.538
ASHLEY: Can I-- Is there a door there? Somewhere,
right there?

01:00:22.538 --> 01:00:24.817
MATT: You move around here, there is a door over here,
yes.

01:00:24.878 --> 01:00:28.956
ASHLEY: I can't really do anything. Check it out,
check it out.

01:00:28.956 --> 01:00:30.682
LIAM: Yeah, bust in. You can't stealth.

01:00:30.682 --> 01:00:32.597
MATT: The door is a secondary guest room.

01:00:32.597 --> 01:00:34.613
LIAM: And now, poop on this bed.

01:00:34.613 --> 01:00:36.081
ASHLEY: All right.

01:00:36.081 --> 01:00:39.291
(laughter)

01:00:39.291 --> 01:00:42.370
TALIESIN: I can't do anything that could make
noise anyway.

01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:49.398
MATT: It is a guest room of equal design and
dressing as the one that Scanlan, you are unaware,

01:00:49.398 --> 01:00:50.698
is currently fouling.

01:00:50.698 --> 01:00:52.904
(laughter)

01:00:52.904 --> 01:00:59.259
ASHLEY: Maybe I get a sudden urge for some reason
to just poo on the bed.

01:00:59.259 --> 01:01:02.048
(laughter)

01:01:02.048 --> 01:01:08.582
MATT: You can do what you want. Be aware, Pike as
a character has her intent, the more you stray

01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:11.557
from that, the more it will have ramifications for
her in the end.

01:01:11.557 --> 01:01:14.606
ASHLEY: Yes, I know, I'm just kidding, That's not
what, that's not what I want to do. I was just,

01:01:14.606 --> 01:01:17.014
had this feeling that Scanlan was doing something
and I felt that--

01:01:17.014 --> 01:01:21.008
SAM: She could probably hear, muffled from behind
the door, (grunts).

01:01:21.008 --> 01:01:29.171
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'll just-- I guess I can't do
anything while I'm in there, so? Can I just--

01:01:29.171 --> 01:01:33.244
MATT: That's about as far as you're able to move.
You can still use your action if you wanted to do

01:01:33.244 --> 01:01:37.541
anything, but right now your vision is currently
fairly well-blocked by a woman and a bear, and a

01:01:37.541 --> 01:01:38.956
man the size of a bear.

01:01:38.956 --> 01:01:41.334
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay, so I'll just hang out there.

01:01:41.334 --> 01:01:48.646
MATT: Okay, so that brings us back to Kima, who
currently doesn't have any sort of way of getting

01:01:48.646 --> 01:01:51.854
over there, kind of frustrating, trying 
to find a way over.

01:01:51.854 --> 01:01:53.975
MARISHA: It's a narrow hallway.

01:01:54.136 --> 01:01:57.172
MATT: Clarota, who is still invisible, is just gonna
hold on that point.

01:01:57.216 --> 01:02:01.167
ORION: As everybody is doing this, I'm going to--
why are you blocking me, I'm not supposed to be

01:02:01.167 --> 01:02:04.089
this close to this thing! Keep going.

01:02:04.089 --> 01:02:08.464
MATT: Okay, Percy! Stand there? All right, Tiberius,
you're up.

01:02:08.464 --> 01:02:15.080
ORION: Oh, like I was saying. Well, shit.

01:02:15.127 --> 01:02:26.371
SAM: Aren't you right next to the guy? Kill him.

01:02:26.533 --> 01:02:29.677
MATT: Do it quick, or we are gonna move for the
next turn.

01:02:29.677 --> 01:02:35.125
ORION: Okay, I'll just lift up my hand and go,
Firebolt.

01:02:35.125 --> 01:02:39.123
MATT: Okay, point-blank Firebolt. Go ahead and
roll your spell attack.

01:02:39.123 --> 01:02:45.681
ORION: Okay, okay, 20.

01:02:45.681 --> 01:02:52.316
MATT: 20, all right. That'll hit, go ahead and roll for
damage for the Firebolt.

01:02:52.316 --> 01:02:59.832
ORION: Okay, ten, 18, 20, 21, 23.

01:02:59.832 --> 01:03:05.528
MATT: 23 damage? All right. So as you
instinctively pull back, you release the blast of

01:03:05.528 --> 01:03:10.297
Firebolt energy, the duergar who is currently
harrying you with this warhammer takes the brunt

01:03:10.374 --> 01:03:16.308
of it right to the bottom of his face and his
torso. The studded leather armor that he's wearing

01:03:16.356 --> 01:03:20.983
tears open with a sheer flaming burst of the
impact of it, and you see most of his skin is

01:03:20.983 --> 01:03:26.295
charred and burned at that point. He reels back for a
second, looking very, very hurt but not quite put

01:03:26.356 --> 01:03:27.482
down yet.

01:03:27.482 --> 01:03:35.294
ORION: As my bonus action, I'm gonna spend two
sorcery points and do it again. So I roll for

01:03:35.294 --> 01:03:38.682
that. It's a 22.

01:03:38.682 --> 01:03:44.445
MATT: All right, the second blast, as he reaches
back, before he can get a chance to get back to

01:03:44.477 --> 01:03:48.399
his feet, the second blast hits. This time, it sends
him off his feet, flying about five to ten feet

01:03:48.448 --> 01:03:50.042
back, skidding across the ground.

01:03:50.042 --> 01:03:51.200
ORION: 15 damage.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:58.096
MATT: Yes, and that puts him, still on the floor,
laid out with a burning, kind of crippling, crispy

01:03:58.096 --> 01:04:02.769
scent in the air of what was once a standing
duergar, now dead and burning on the ground.

01:04:02.769 --> 01:04:10.101
MARISHA: So once again I grab him by the scruff,
take him, and put him in the bathroom.

01:04:10.171 --> 01:04:14.297
LIAM: I give a couple of pats on Tiberius's
shoulder and start to inch down the hall.

01:04:14.347 --> 01:04:18.690
MATT: All right, as you guys are doing this,
Scanlan steps out of the guest room, getting his

01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:20.165
pantaloons back on.

01:04:20.165 --> 01:04:21.862
SAM: My invisible pantaloons.

01:04:21.862 --> 01:04:26.453
MATT: Yes. You hear the footprints of Scanlan,
you being still invisible, you essentially just--

01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:34.349
SAM: I phantom pooped. Did I find anything in
there, by the way?

01:04:34.367 --> 01:04:36.116
LIAM: Just relief.

01:04:36.116 --> 01:04:39.753
MATT: You found a fun way to prank duergar.

01:04:39.753 --> 01:04:41.784
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, did I find anything in the
barracks?

01:04:41.784 --> 01:04:43.621
MATT: Over there? No.

01:04:43.621 --> 01:04:49.484
TALIESIN: Did Liam-- Did Vax find anything shiny
in the room? The shiny thing.

01:04:49.484 --> 01:04:54.257
LIAM: No, I got interrupted. That's a good idea,
thanks for the reminder, Percy.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.706
TALIESIN: You're welcome, yes.

01:04:55.706 --> 01:04:59.371
LIAM: Checking for-- I checked for traps
before, but I can't remember what I rolled. I'm

01:04:59.539 --> 01:05:00.933
sure it was successful.

01:05:00.933 --> 01:05:02.222
MATT: Go ahead and roll again.

01:05:02.222 --> 01:05:03.749
(laughter)

01:05:03.749 --> 01:05:04.768
LIAM: 17.

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:09.621
MATT: Okay, as you push the door open and get a
glance inside of the main hall, you don't see any

01:05:09.621 --> 01:05:10.928
traps across the floor.

01:05:10.928 --> 01:05:12.658
LIAM: Okay, I'm gonna go check out the shiny
thing.

01:05:12.658 --> 01:05:14.864
MATT: Okay. Everyone else staying out in the
hallway?

01:05:14.864 --> 01:05:16.126
SAM: I'm coming with him.

01:05:16.126 --> 01:05:16.812
MATT: Okay.

01:05:16.872 --> 01:05:18.266
SAM: If I can get there.

01:05:18.266 --> 01:05:21.635
MATT: You manage to scoot through, dancing around
folks, people kind of let you get by.

01:05:21.635 --> 01:05:22.825
Anyone else?

01:05:22.825 --> 01:05:25.510
LAURA: Yeah, sure, I like shiny things.

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:31.336
MARISHA: I'm burying my shame, again. Burying the
duergar.

01:05:31.336 --> 01:05:34.261
MATT: So, you're dragging the duergar over in
the--

01:05:34.261 --> 01:05:35.534
TALIESIN: I'll go in, too.

01:05:35.534 --> 01:05:37.752
ASHLEY: I'll follow, I'll follow.

01:05:37.752 --> 01:05:40.192
LAURA: We're all going. It's a big, happy room.

01:05:40.192 --> 01:05:42.410
LIAM: So say we all.

01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:44.572
MARISHA: Well, I guess I'll go after I bury
duergar.

01:05:44.572 --> 01:05:49.759
MATT: Yes, as you guys step in here, move up
towards the back corner, where there's the shiny

01:05:49.759 --> 01:05:52.172
glint. Tiberius, you stay inside or outside?

01:05:52.172 --> 01:05:55.381
ORION: I'm going to wait for everybody to go inside.

01:05:55.381 --> 01:05:58.043
MARISHA: We will be Team Outside Posse.

01:05:58.043 --> 01:06:04.432
MATT: Kima walks in, Grog goes to start making his
way in. As he does, you go over towards the

01:06:04.432 --> 01:06:09.577
glimmer. The glimmer on the table, you look, it's
just formless and kind of this weird spark of

01:06:09.577 --> 01:06:13.352
light. It then vanishes, and the doors that you
guys entered--

01:06:13.421 --> 01:06:14.982
LAURA: (singsong) It's a trap.

01:06:14.982 --> 01:06:20.342
MATT: -- slam behind you, with Tiberius, Grog and
Keyleth all kept outside of the room.

01:06:20.342 --> 01:06:21.488
ASHLEY: No!

01:06:21.488 --> 01:06:26.556
MATT: The rest of you guys, the flames go to
darkness and the entire room goes pitch-black.

01:06:26.556 --> 01:06:27.863
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

01:06:27.863 --> 01:06:29.146
LAURA: Oh, no, we don't have light.

01:06:29.146 --> 01:06:31.568
LIAM: In the darkness, I say, fuck!

01:06:31.568 --> 01:06:33.942
(laughter)

01:06:33.942 --> 01:06:35.397
LAURA: Stupid, stupid, stupid!

01:06:35.397 --> 01:06:38.627
ORION: I motion to Grog and I'm like, you know
what to do, damn it.

01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:44.830
MATT: Grog's gonna go for the door, however, at
this point in time, I'm going to ask for--

01:06:44.894 --> 01:06:47.922
LAURA: Can we stealth? I mean, I guess we're all
kind of--

01:06:47.922 --> 01:06:49.385
SAM: Ask for?

01:06:49.385 --> 01:06:52.608
LIAM: Roll for Deus ex Machina.

01:06:52.608 --> 01:06:55.333
SAM: Oh, You're gonna ask the chat room
something?

01:06:55.333 --> 01:06:58.986
MATT: No, no, no. I'm not. I'm working
out what's actually gonna happen here. All right,

01:06:59.059 --> 01:07:13.589
so, suddenly there is a cacophonous bit of pain
streaking through Pike, Vex, and Clarota. Guys, go

01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:16.851
ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.

01:07:16.851 --> 01:07:18.320
SAM: Intelligence?

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.370
LAURA: All of us?

01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:20.715
SAM: Some sort of a mind thing.

01:07:20.715 --> 01:07:21.958
LAURA: Oh, crud.

01:07:21.958 --> 01:07:25.061
MARISHA: Intelligence.

01:07:25.061 --> 01:07:29.056
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh! Oh, no, I don't get any
advantage in this.

01:07:29.056 --> 01:07:30.539
LIAM: 13.

01:07:30.539 --> 01:07:34.175
MATT: Not you, just you two. So what's the--

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:35.873
TALIESIN: Never mind, that was such a good roll.

01:07:35.873 --> 01:07:38.478
ASHLEY: What was that? That's a one. (laughs)

01:07:38.478 --> 01:07:39.614
MATT: Okay.

01:07:39.614 --> 01:07:40.955
ASHLEY: I rolled a one!

01:07:40.955 --> 01:07:46.648
MATT: So in the darkness, suddenly there is this
searing pain, like some sort of screaming sound is

01:07:46.648 --> 01:07:52.077
blasting you from the inside of your very mind.
You two are both currently stunned.

01:07:52.077 --> 01:07:53.313
LAURA: Oh, crud.

01:07:53.313 --> 01:07:54.701
SAM: Who's you two?

01:07:54.701 --> 01:07:56.100
LAURA: Me and Pike.

01:07:56.100 --> 01:08:03.035
ASHLEY: I did bad things, I did bad things. I
shouldn't have killed a man while he was down.

01:08:03.035 --> 01:08:08.398
Wait, so what does that-- That means we just can't
do anything, right?

01:08:08.398 --> 01:08:11.907
MATT: On every turn, you get to try and break
that, but right now neither of you can--

01:08:11.907 --> 01:08:15.098
MARISHA: Every turn they have to try and break out
of it? It keeps going?

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.959
It's like a keep-going thing?

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:20.520
MATT: You both just sit there, grasping your
heads, just screaming in pain as your body is

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:25.970
unable to function or listen to any thought
process. Clarota also unfortunately falls victim

01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:29.607
to this and is also unable to make any actions.

01:08:29.607 --> 01:08:30.761
SAM: Oh boy!

01:08:30.761 --> 01:08:35.715
LIAM: I'm pulling out my flametongue dagger to try
to get a little bit of light in here.

01:08:35.715 --> 01:08:42.591
MATT: All right, however-- You, as you are
currently pulling out your flametongue dagger, you

01:08:42.591 --> 01:08:47.983
feel a presence nearby, and with a little bit of
embers around the fire, you see, out of nothing, a

01:08:47.983 --> 01:08:53.748
figure step into view that apparently was not
visible but a moment before. A tall, lithe figure,

01:08:53.748 --> 01:08:59.057
with long limbs, fingers and a wrapping of facial
tentacles coming towards your face.

01:08:59.057 --> 01:09:00.648
SAM: It was invisible.

01:09:00.648 --> 01:09:02.907
LIAM: I see him, I'm gonna stab, I'm just gonna stab.

01:09:02.907 --> 01:09:05.609
MATT: Before you get the chance to stab, you get a
surprise attack from this guy.

01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:07.809
LAURA: Oh, no, what if he sucks our brains out?

01:09:07.809 --> 01:09:14.105
MATT: All right, that comes to an 18 versus armor
class.

01:09:14.105 --> 01:09:15.673
LIAM: Yeah, he got me.

01:09:15.673 --> 01:09:20.352
MATT: So, as you go back for your blade to pull it
out, he grabs you by the shoulders and pulls you,

01:09:20.352 --> 01:09:24.267
and the tentacles wrap around your face and pull
you into this horrible toothy maw. You feel this

01:09:24.273 --> 01:09:28.071
tearing pain sensation as its teeth begin to dig
into your face.

01:09:28.071 --> 01:09:29.561
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no.

01:09:29.731 --> 01:09:32.860
LAURA: Oh my god, he's gonna die.

01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:35.357
LIAM: That hurts. A lot.

01:09:35.357 --> 01:09:43.496
MATT: You take 17 points of psychic damage as the
actual presence of the tentacles pulling on your

01:09:43.496 --> 01:09:47.399
face, you feel it's kind of grabbing your brain
and trying to hold it in place. You are currently

01:09:47.399 --> 01:09:48.803
considered grappled.

01:09:48.803 --> 01:09:50.118
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

01:09:50.118 --> 01:09:57.176
MATT: Now, guys, everyone roll initiative. That
was a surprise round.

01:09:57.176 --> 01:09:59.141
MARISHA: Surprise round.

01:09:59.141 --> 01:10:00.268
MATT: Yes.

01:10:00.268 --> 01:10:02.360
MARISHA: 'Cause they got the drop on us

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.948
TALIESIN: That'll do.

01:10:04.948 --> 01:10:08.740
ORION: What's going on in there? I hear lots of
ruckus.

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:10.524
SAM: We'll be out in a minute.

01:10:10.524 --> 01:10:17.732
ORION: Don't give me that, Scanlan. Oh. Scanlan,
you can hear me. What's going on in there?

01:10:17.732 --> 01:10:19.522
SAM: We're all dying.

01:10:19.522 --> 01:10:22.769
ORION: I turn to Grog. They're all dying.

01:10:22.769 --> 01:10:27.082
MATT: (laughs) All right, so 25 to 20?

01:10:27.082 --> 01:10:28.879
SAM: No one.

01:10:28.879 --> 01:10:35.415
MATT: All right, 25 to 20, no one-- almost forgot,
go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.

01:10:35.459 --> 01:10:42.213
LIAM: 23.

01:10:42.213 --> 01:10:46.717
MATT: 23, all right, you feel the presence of its
mind pressing into your brain and you manage to,

01:10:46.717 --> 01:10:51.366
through the pain of its tentacles pulling you
towards its mouth, shrug off its current attempt

01:10:51.366 --> 01:10:53.023
to push into your mind.

01:10:53.023 --> 01:10:54.672
LIAM: I'm thinking of the middle finger.

01:10:54.672 --> 01:11:00.577
MATT: That's a good thing. Okay. So you're still
grappled but you're not stunned.

01:11:00.577 --> 01:11:02.566
SAM: Is he a piece on the board yet?

01:11:02.566 --> 01:11:06.076
MATT: Both of them are now visible right there.
All right, so, 25 to 20?

01:11:06.076 --> 01:11:07.303
LAURA: Nobody.

01:11:07.303 --> 01:11:08.696
MATT: 20 to 15?

01:11:08.696 --> 01:11:09.809
LIAM: 17.

01:11:09.809 --> 01:11:10.790
TALIESIN: 16.

01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:11.764
ORION: 17.

01:11:11.764 --> 01:11:28.632
MATT: 17 and 16, all right. So actually, Grog is
going first. All right, and Percy. 15 to ten? Ten

01:11:28.632 --> 01:11:29.595
to five?

01:11:29.595 --> 01:11:31.144
MARISHA: Oh, oh, wait, 13.

01:11:31.144 --> 01:11:32.805
(laughter)

01:11:32.805 --> 01:11:34.344
MARISHA: Sorry, I was thinking about shit.

01:11:34.344 --> 01:11:36.105
MATT: That's okay. Ten to five?

01:11:36.105 --> 01:11:37.268
LAURA: Nine.

01:11:37.268 --> 01:11:39.232
TALIESIN: Thinking about shit.

01:11:39.232 --> 01:11:42.948
MARISHA: Thinking about life and death. (laughs)

01:11:42.948 --> 01:11:44.361
TALIESIN: Word.

01:11:44.361 --> 01:11:46.000
MATT: All right.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:46.775
SAM: Two.

01:11:46.775 --> 01:11:48.882
ASHLEY: Oh, so did I. Best friends.

01:11:48.882 --> 01:11:51.183
SAM: Besties. Twinsies.

01:11:51.183 --> 01:11:53.249
ASHLEY: Gnomesies.

01:11:53.249 --> 01:11:55.663
(laughter)

01:11:55.663 --> 01:12:06.272
SAM: We're still-- Mr. Dungeon Master, sir, this
is all the same day.

01:12:06.272 --> 01:12:08.292
I don't get any of my spells back?

01:12:08.292 --> 01:12:13.768
MATT: No, you guys have not rested. All right, so
first, the top actually-- Kima is at the top of

01:12:13.768 --> 01:12:15.368
the initiative order.

01:12:15.368 --> 01:12:20.449
MARISHA: Kima, get it girl, get it, get it girl.

01:12:20.449 --> 01:12:25.354
MATT: Kima angrily leaps on top of the table and
goes running down with an angry yell, and leaps

01:12:25.354 --> 01:12:30.106
down toward the one that's currently grabbing onto
you with its grapple. As she's running a little

01:12:30.106 --> 01:12:34.020
bit of light bursts, as you can see this divine
energy begin to burst and glow off the edge of the

01:12:34.226 --> 01:12:37.937
greatsword that she's holding. She leaps down,
and with a giant arc through the air that lights

01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:44.421
up that portion of the room with a brief sweep,
the blade comes down towards-- oh, that'll hit.

01:12:44.421 --> 01:12:47.227
Second attack also hits.

01:12:47.227 --> 01:12:48.414
ASHLEY: Yes, go Kima.

01:12:48.414 --> 01:13:02.076
MATT: So that comes to-- okay, using her Divine
Smite ability on top of that, she manages to deal

01:13:02.076 --> 01:13:04.273
37 points of damage to it.

01:13:04.273 --> 01:13:05.694
TALIESIN: Damn.

01:13:05.694 --> 01:13:14.689
MATT: As she finishes both of her strikes
simultaneously. The mindflayer, however, does not

01:13:14.689 --> 01:13:20.106
release its grasp on you. You are still considered
grappled. That ends her turn. Grog now is gonna

01:13:20.106 --> 01:13:24.578
angrily attempt to bash into this door, is gonna
make an-- actually no, no athletics check, he's

01:13:24.578 --> 01:13:28.446
going to go into a rage and hitting away at the
door.

01:13:28.446 --> 01:13:31.964
(growling)

01:13:31.964 --> 01:13:36.873
LIAM and LAURA: (Grog voice) I would like to
rage.

01:13:36.873 --> 01:13:39.383
(laughter)

01:13:39.383 --> 01:13:46.085
MATT: All right, that puts a total of 32 points of
damage, that's enough. So Grog just takes two big

01:13:46.085 --> 01:13:50.423
swings. The first one comes through, cracks the
door in half, splitting it down the center. Rears

01:13:50.423 --> 01:13:53.994
back a second time, cleaves through the door
entirely. What little bit is left on the hinges,

01:13:53.994 --> 01:13:59.534
he kicks out with his foot, leaving now this side
completely open to the interior. He then moves in

01:13:59.534 --> 01:14:07.752
around Clarota. That's as far as he can get in
this current turn. That brings us to Vax.

01:14:07.752 --> 01:14:10.488
LIAM: What can I do while grappled, nothing until
I'm ungrappled?

01:14:10.488 --> 01:14:13.400
MATT: Well, no, you can try and make an acrobatics
or athletics roll against them

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.896
to try and break free.

01:14:14.896 --> 01:14:17.623
LIAM: Okay, but then do I have an action once
that's done or that's the action?

01:14:17.623 --> 01:14:19.469
MATT: I'll let you use that as your move.

01:14:19.469 --> 01:14:23.277
LIAM: All right, so I'm gonna try to use, I guess
athletics is what I would do.

01:14:23.277 --> 01:14:25.019
MATT: Or acrobatics, up to you, whichever's
higher.

01:14:25.019 --> 01:14:27.373
LIAM: Well, that would be acrobatics.

01:14:27.373 --> 01:14:28.866
MATT: Acrobatics, then.

01:14:28.866 --> 01:14:29.958
LIAM: 27.

01:14:29.958 --> 01:14:30.957
MATT: 27?

01:14:30.957 --> 01:14:31.941
LIAM: Yeah.

01:14:31.941 --> 01:14:34.224
MATT: That'll do it.

01:14:34.224 --> 01:14:35.164
LIAM: Okay.

01:14:35.164 --> 01:14:38.657
MATT: You manage to, just in that moment of it
being struck with the two blade strikes from Lady

01:14:38.657 --> 01:14:43.650
Kima, you manage to pull your head free from its
grasp. And just manage to right yourself now, the

01:14:43.650 --> 01:14:46.545
throbbing pain in your head of what you just
narrowly avoided still there.

01:14:46.545 --> 01:14:52.663
LIAM: Okay. Poison dagger in hand, I roll an 18.
Does that hit?

01:14:52.663 --> 01:14:57.317
MATT: Okay. 18. Currently that does hit, yes.

01:14:57.317 --> 01:14:59.983
LIAM: I wanna grab him by the calamari and stab
him in the eye.

01:14:59.983 --> 01:15:01.322
(laughter)

01:15:01.322 --> 01:15:02.767
MATT: Okay, go for it.

01:15:02.767 --> 01:15:07.693
LIAM: That's what I did, so-- and then if I'm five
feet-- if Kima's there, I can sneak attack

01:15:07.693 --> 01:15:09.326
according to the rules?

01:15:09.326 --> 01:15:10.293
MATT: Correct.

01:15:10.293 --> 01:15:19.624
LIAM: All right, so I'm gonna stab him in the eye.
One. Plus the sneak attack damage is two, four,

01:15:19.624 --> 01:15:27.690
ten, 13, 19, 38, plus seven-- 45.

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:32.672
MATT: 45. All right. So, as you--

01:15:32.672 --> 01:15:33.895
LIAM: With the poison dagger.

01:15:33.895 --> 01:15:37.067
MATT: Right, the poison dagger. I think you've
already used the daily poison ability on this.

01:15:37.067 --> 01:15:38.592
LIAM: I don't remember, so it's just a stab.

01:15:38.592 --> 01:15:42.547
MATT: Okay. So the 45 points of damage. You pull
back and you jam it into the side of its eye. You

01:15:42.547 --> 01:15:49.640
can see as it rears back, a spray of dark-colored
liquid kind of warms the side of your face. As you

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:54.033
pull the blade back out it rears back and
(growls). You can hear its voice piercing into

01:15:54.033 --> 01:15:58.253
your head going, "I will eat you one way or
another!"

01:15:58.253 --> 01:15:59.853
ASHLEY: No, you won't!

01:15:59.853 --> 01:16:03.025
LAURA: Did it distract him enough that we lost our
thingy?

01:16:03.025 --> 01:16:05.740
MATT: That's your main attack?

01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:09.897
LIAM: I mean, I would imagine between ungrappling
and stabbing, is that it for me? Or do I get my

01:16:09.897 --> 01:16:10.974
second attack, I don't know?

01:16:10.974 --> 01:16:12.188
MATT: You can get your second attack, I'm sorry.

01:16:12.188 --> 01:16:19.058
LIAM: Okay, well I think, go fuck yourself, and
stab again. Nine plus-- 19.

01:16:19.058 --> 01:16:21.642
MATT: 19? Yeah, that hits.

01:16:21.642 --> 01:16:26.558
LIAM: Other eye, other eye. No sneak attack. Two
plus-- eight.

01:16:26.558 --> 01:16:33.202
MATT: Eight. Okay. As it rears back and you hear
it saying that, you pull back and you grab with

01:16:33.202 --> 01:16:38.407
your off hand the cluster of tentacles in the
front of its face and pull it down. As you do, the

01:16:38.407 --> 01:16:43.664
inertia-- you jam the blade into the other eye. As
you do, you hear this blast burst of angry scream

01:16:43.664 --> 01:16:49.068
inside your head, before it goes dead cold,
silent, and the mind flayer falls to the ground.

01:16:49.068 --> 01:16:51.343
LIAM: I fucking hate these things!

01:16:51.343 --> 01:17:02.312
MATT: All right. That brings us to Clarota, who's
currently stunned and fails save, Clarota's still

01:17:02.312 --> 01:17:03.968
stunned. Tiberius.

01:17:03.968 --> 01:17:06.582
ORION: I look through the door.

01:17:06.582 --> 01:17:08.558
MATT: Look through the door.

01:17:08.558 --> 01:17:12.819
ORION: What's going on in here? Are there any
enemies I can see?

01:17:12.819 --> 01:17:17.145
MATT: You can see over here, barely. It's very
dark in the far corner, you can see just the shape

01:17:17.145 --> 01:17:18.653
of some humanoid there.

01:17:18.653 --> 01:17:25.808
ORION: Oh. Okay, is he-- (laughs)

01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:27.562
MATT: What are you doing, Tiberius?

01:17:27.562 --> 01:17:29.465
ORION: (laughs) How tall is the thing?

01:17:29.465 --> 01:17:34.256
MATT: From what you can see, it's maybe roughly
six, seven feet. Grog's blocking most of it.

01:17:34.256 --> 01:17:36.395
ORION: No, like, we're in a bunker, right?

01:17:36.395 --> 01:17:39.697
MATT: Right now, you're in this giant great hall
with giant tables and stools everywhere.

01:17:39.697 --> 01:17:41.053
ORION: And the ceiling is--

01:17:41.053 --> 01:17:42.830
MATT: You can't see the ceiling right now, there's
no light.

01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:44.009
ORION: Oh.

01:17:44.009 --> 01:17:47.766
MATT: The room is near pitch-black, like there's
just very little light in there currently.

01:17:47.766 --> 01:17:51.160
ORION: I will waltz in behind Grog.

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:52.258
MATT: All right.

01:17:52.258 --> 01:17:57.408
ORION: I cast Light.

01:17:57.408 --> 01:18:03.781
MATT: Okay. The room all of a sudden bursts into
view, you can now see the walls, the ceiling--

01:18:03.781 --> 01:18:10.959
it's a smooth stone room. There is a large
chandelier currently hanging from the top of the

01:18:10.959 --> 01:18:16.067
ceiling. It's about 25 feet up to the ceiling in
this current room.

01:18:16.067 --> 01:18:18.141
MARISHA: (gasps) There's a big chandelier. That's
fun.

01:18:18.141 --> 01:18:25.583
ORION: And now do I see that guy better?

01:18:25.583 --> 01:18:28.695
MATT: You do, yes. You see now there is a mind
flayer currently ducking behind one of the tables

01:18:28.695 --> 01:18:31.534
right now. You can see a number of your friends in
the party are currently clutching their heads,

01:18:31.534 --> 01:18:33.870
silently screaming to themselves, unmoving.

01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:38.193
ORION: Ah, right. There's another one of those
guys over there!

01:18:38.193 --> 01:18:40.348
MARISHA: Wait, there's another one?

01:18:40.348 --> 01:18:41.385
ORION: Yes!

01:18:41.385 --> 01:18:42.310
MARISHA: There's two?

01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:43.352
MATT: There's two.

01:18:43.352 --> 01:18:46.517
ORION: I spend three sorcerer points.

01:18:46.517 --> 01:18:48.917
MATT: How many sorcerer points do you have left?
You spent a lot over the past couple games.

01:18:48.917 --> 01:18:54.758
ORION: No, I have not, because I didn't do
anything last game, because I was all recharged.

01:18:54.758 --> 01:18:58.702
MATT: That's true, actually. Okay. Just keep track
of that. So how many do you have left?

01:18:58.702 --> 01:19:01.589
ORION: I have eight right now. Now I'll spend it
to go down to--

01:19:01.589 --> 01:19:02.465
LAURA: Five.

01:19:02.465 --> 01:19:03.878
ORION: Five. 'Cause math.

01:19:03.878 --> 01:19:06.278
MATT: Okay, got you. Cool, good on you.

01:19:06.278 --> 01:19:10.219
MARISHA: Fantasy math. Once again, 826LA,
after-school tutoring. Good charity.

01:19:10.219 --> 01:19:16.863
ORION: I could have used it. I cast my pillars, or
Grand Columns, as I like to call it, and (piston

01:19:16.863 --> 01:19:19.570
sound) all the way up and smash that little
bastard.

01:19:19.570 --> 01:19:20.670
MATT: All right.

01:19:20.670 --> 01:19:22.009
MARISHA: Smashy smashy.

01:19:22.009 --> 01:19:23.089
MATT: So what's the save you get past that for the
spell?

01:19:23.089 --> 01:19:31.164
ORION: He does a dex save, and he takes 6d6
damage, and the dex save is to see if he's pinned

01:19:31.164 --> 01:19:32.529
or not.

01:19:32.529 --> 01:19:35.368
MATT: Right. It does make its save, I believe,
it's 21?

01:19:35.368 --> 01:19:38.527
ORION: Oh, my, what?

01:19:38.527 --> 01:19:45.351
MATT: Rolled a 21 versus your DC of your spell,
which I believe is not higher than 21.

01:19:45.351 --> 01:19:46.273
ORION: No.

01:19:46.273 --> 01:19:48.676
MATT: So yeah, so he still takes the damage, but
is not pinned.

01:19:48.676 --> 01:19:54.924
ORION: Which is 15, 18 points of damage.

01:19:54.924 --> 01:19:59.078
MATT: Okay, 18 points of damage, and manages to
pull out of the way just in time as it slams into

01:19:59.078 --> 01:20:02.694
him, he darts off and catches himself on the
ground, kind of slowly levitating above the ground

01:20:02.694 --> 01:20:08.721
as he comes to a stop. The pillar then slams into
the roof, this section here. Actually splinters

01:20:08.721 --> 01:20:18.016
part of the table, which is now kind of lifted
off-kilter at an angle. Yup. It--

01:20:18.016 --> 01:20:23.601
ORION: Oh, so that-- does that mean he's in the
air for a whole round? 'Cause how it works is,

01:20:23.601 --> 01:20:28.375
he's all the way up to that height, but he gets to
come, or fall, back down if he makes the save.

01:20:28.375 --> 01:20:33.352
That's how-- so he has to travel that distance, so
does he cast Levitate as he's coming down?

01:20:33.352 --> 01:20:36.890
MATT: How I'm playing it is, the impact of the
pillar suddenly slamming in from underneath is

01:20:36.890 --> 01:20:40.903
what does the initial damage, and he manages to
roll off before it slams into the ceiling. He

01:20:40.903 --> 01:20:46.196
kinda-- So. However, that ends your turn. The mind
flayer, now looking around and seeing the room lit

01:20:46.196 --> 01:20:51.788
up, seeing the entire group now in this room,
looks around at everyone, puts its hands together

01:20:51.788 --> 01:20:55.493
and concentrates-- and as it does you see its form
(sucking noise) vanish.

01:20:55.493 --> 01:20:59.157
MARISHA: Damn it!

01:20:59.157 --> 01:21:06.779
MATT: A few seconds pass, you guys manage to shrug
your stun, and Clarota as well.

01:21:06.779 --> 01:21:08.471
ASHLEY: Whoa, what happened?

01:21:08.471 --> 01:21:09.738
MARISHA: That's not good.

01:21:09.738 --> 01:21:10.779
LAURA: What happened?

01:21:10.779 --> 01:21:12.583
MARISHA: They really know we're here.

01:21:12.583 --> 01:21:14.864
LAURA: We need to get out of this room, then.

01:21:14.864 --> 01:21:18.940
TALIESIN: Let's just search the rest of this floor
as quickly as possible.

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.355
MARISHA: As quickly as possible.

01:21:20.355 --> 01:21:27.499
LAURA: Grog, can you always put down the dust of
tracelessness?

01:21:27.499 --> 01:21:33.982
MATT: "All right, I will." He's doing his
flower-girl moment. Passes behind you guys. All

01:21:33.994 --> 01:21:36.271
right, so, what is the current mode of action for
you guys?

01:21:36.271 --> 01:21:39.401
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and dart down this
hall that we know is for sure empty.

01:21:39.401 --> 01:21:40.832
MATT: Okay.

01:21:40.832 --> 01:21:43.229
LIAM: Exit the other side of the great hall that
we're in.

01:21:43.229 --> 01:21:44.236
MATT: All right.

01:21:44.236 --> 01:21:47.652
LAURA: And I think we should all go back-- we
should go to the second floor.

01:21:47.652 --> 01:21:49.741
MATT: Through here.

01:21:49.741 --> 01:21:51.346
LIAM: Walking in that door.

01:21:51.346 --> 01:21:57.438
MATT: You look through here and see what appears
to be some sort of a kitchen. You can see shelf

01:21:57.438 --> 01:22:01.392
units, you can see what looks like a few tables, you
can see some kitchen elements.

01:22:01.485 --> 01:22:03.677
LIAM: I'm gonna walk all the way in, all the way
in.

01:22:03.677 --> 01:22:06.188
MATT: All right, you walk all the way in. There's
a door towards the back--

01:22:06.188 --> 01:22:08.225
LIAM: The right, what do I see?

01:22:08.225 --> 01:22:11.314
MATT: The right, you see what looks to be a
doorway that's partially open that leads to a

01:22:11.314 --> 01:22:12.354
staircase.

01:22:12.354 --> 01:22:13.461
LIAM: Up or down?

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:14.981
MATT: Looks like it's going up.

01:22:14.981 --> 01:22:16.946
MARISHA: And what's in this room? I'm looking over
here.

01:22:16.946 --> 01:22:19.691
MATT: Okay, you look over here. It's a double door
that is currently closed.

01:22:19.691 --> 01:22:22.673
TALIESIN: I will head in your direction as well.

01:22:22.673 --> 01:22:24.776
ORION: Eight, two of my d6s to heal up.

01:22:24.776 --> 01:22:30.948
MATT: You haven't taken a short rest yet. You have
to-- you guys have to stop and take ten minutes,

01:22:30.948 --> 01:22:33.148
15 minutes to rest to do that, so--

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:38.846
SAM: I'm gonna look all over the great hall and
see if there's any cool stuff in there.

01:22:38.846 --> 01:22:41.078
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:22:41.078 --> 01:22:43.524
LAURA: I think what we should do-- Everyone, I
think what we should do is make our way back to

01:22:43.524 --> 01:22:48.553
the initial storage room we were in and go up that
stairway, because that one's hidden. It's by a

01:22:48.553 --> 01:22:53.276
hidden entrance, people aren't gonna think about
that one as much as main stairways.

01:22:53.276 --> 01:22:56.880
TALIESIN: I agree, I think we should-- I agree
with that, I just think we should check the rest

01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:01.443
of the floor as well. Just double-check
everything, make sure we didn't miss the--

01:23:01.443 --> 01:23:03.251
LIAM: Vax is heading back to the group.

01:23:03.251 --> 01:23:04.534
MATT: Okay.

01:23:04.534 --> 01:23:08.865
MARISHA: Percy and I are checking this room with
the double doors. Do you have any trap checks to

01:23:08.865 --> 01:23:10.096
see if it's locked?

01:23:10.096 --> 01:23:11.364
LIAM: I do!

01:23:11.364 --> 01:23:15.909
MATT: Okay, so Percy and both you guys open this
doorway. It opens up into what looks to be another

01:23:15.909 --> 01:23:21.542
smaller eating hall. This one's nicer, this one
has one long table. This is probably where the

01:23:21.542 --> 01:23:25.821
more socially risen--

01:23:25.821 --> 01:23:27.563
TALIESIN: Take a quick look around.

01:23:27.563 --> 01:23:29.183
MARISHA: Yeah, anything in there?

01:23:29.183 --> 01:23:31.849
MATT: Looks like it hasn't been used for a day or
two.

01:23:31.849 --> 01:23:32.807
TALIESIN: All right.

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:34.053
MARISHA: No cool goodies?

01:23:34.053 --> 01:23:35.628
MATT: No current goodies in this area, no.

01:23:35.628 --> 01:23:39.878
TALIESIN: So we'll go-- just keep going down and
check the rest of that hallway.

01:23:39.878 --> 01:23:41.217
MATT: Okay.

01:23:41.217 --> 01:23:47.280
LAURA: There's a lot more, you guys. I think we
should go find the vault on the second floor.

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:56.752
MATT: All right, you guys press down here. There
apparently are now-- you can see there's another

01:23:56.752 --> 01:23:58.184
set of double doors--

01:23:58.184 --> 01:23:59.556
LIAM: Vax is following.

01:23:59.556 --> 01:24:00.631
MATT: All right.

01:24:00.631 --> 01:24:05.509
LAURA: I think I should gather the group and try
to make it back to the other storage room. Just to

01:24:05.509 --> 01:24:07.456
get us out of this area specifically.

01:24:07.456 --> 01:24:08.999
MATT: So you guys are all moving back with--

01:24:08.999 --> 01:24:09.865
LAURA: Is that cool?

01:24:09.865 --> 01:24:11.464
MATT: -- Vex to return to the previous storage
room?

01:24:11.464 --> 01:24:13.090
MARISHA: We can do that. Yeah, go for it.

01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:17.902
TALIESIN: And you'll hear us if anything goes
wrong. Yeah, we'll power through it.

01:24:17.902 --> 01:24:19.279
LAURA: Use your earring.

01:24:19.279 --> 01:24:20.406
MATT: All right.

01:24:20.406 --> 01:24:26.634
MARISHA: I'll go ahead and very-- I'm just gonna
kinda use my keen sense-- or sorry, my keen smell

01:24:26.634 --> 01:24:29.232
again to see if I can smell any duergar in the
area.

01:24:29.232 --> 01:24:32.842
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check
with advantage.

01:24:32.842 --> 01:24:38.797
MARISHA: That's pretty good. Oh yeah, I'll take
that first roll, which was seven-- 27.

01:24:38.797 --> 01:24:47.007
MATT: 27. You smell that on this floor, there
doesn't appear to be any duergar in your immediate

01:24:47.007 --> 01:24:51.483
vicinity. There is a strong, lingering scent of
them coming from the doorway

01:24:51.483 --> 01:24:52.944
that you're currently at.

01:24:52.944 --> 01:24:55.299
MARISHA: A strong, lingering scent?

01:24:55.299 --> 01:24:59.265
MATT: Correct, like it-- you can kind of tell
there was a recent moving of a large number of

01:24:59.265 --> 01:25:00.148
duergar.

01:25:00.148 --> 01:25:01.579
MARISHA: But probably not present.

01:25:01.579 --> 01:25:02.837
MATT: You don't know.

01:25:02.837 --> 01:25:04.732
MARISHA: Whatever. I guess we'll see what's in
here.

01:25:04.732 --> 01:25:06.223
MATT: All righty.

01:25:06.223 --> 01:25:07.403
MARISHA: Peeky, peeky.

01:25:07.403 --> 01:25:09.391
LIAM: I kind of parkour past Percy.

01:25:09.391 --> 01:25:10.421
MATT: Okay.

01:25:10.421 --> 01:25:11.914
ORION: Parkour past Percy!

01:25:11.914 --> 01:25:13.191
MARISHA: Parkour, parkour!

01:25:13.191 --> 01:25:19.795
MATT: You open the doors into what appears to be a
large temple chamber, a place of worship. What you

01:25:19.795 --> 01:25:24.654
see are a series of long, wooden benches that are
arranged to look towards the center. There is an

01:25:24.654 --> 01:25:30.779
altar to the right that is a risen kind of stone
dais, and in the center there is a stone table, an

01:25:30.779 --> 01:25:34.953
altar which has a piece of black cloth wrapped
over it and something on top of it you can't see

01:25:34.953 --> 01:25:38.996
from this distance. In the center of the room
there is a 12-foot-tall statue of what looks like

01:25:38.996 --> 01:25:43.900
an extremely strong armored duergar clutching a
giant warhammer and a shield.

01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:46.949
MARISHA: Hm. I'm gonna-- oh wait, I'm a tiger.

01:25:46.949 --> 01:25:48.341
MATT: Yup.

01:25:48.341 --> 01:25:52.274
LIAM: I'm gonna perception check the room. Which
is high. 27.

01:25:52.274 --> 01:25:55.211
MATT: 27? There does not appear to be anybody
inside this room.

01:25:55.211 --> 01:25:56.332
LIAM: Screw this room.

01:25:56.332 --> 01:25:57.526
MATT: However, do you have a religion--

01:25:57.526 --> 01:25:59.172
TALIESIN: I would like to do a religion roll.

01:25:59.172 --> 01:26:01.141
MATT: Roll religion, guys.

01:26:01.141 --> 01:26:02.309
TALIESIN: Nine.

01:26:02.309 --> 01:26:03.796
LIAM: Nine.

01:26:03.796 --> 01:26:05.667
ASHLEY: Could I do a religion roll from where I
am?

01:26:05.667 --> 01:26:06.998
MATT: You are not over there, unfortunately.

01:26:06.998 --> 01:26:10.591
MARISHA: That's what I was gonna do, is tell
somebody to get Pike over here real quick.

01:26:10.591 --> 01:26:11.996
LAURA: Do you guys have earrings?

01:26:11.996 --> 01:26:14.991
ASHLEY: I can put on my sprinter's boots.

01:26:14.991 --> 01:26:19.291
LIAM: Yeah, Pike, Pike? There's some sort of
religious artifacts over here. Could use your

01:26:19.291 --> 01:26:20.270
expertise.

01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:22.938
MATT: Pike, you make your way through, eventually
coming down this hallway--

01:26:23.064 --> 01:26:26.955
(clanking)

01:26:27.012 --> 01:26:29.410
MARISHA: She's coming! I can hear her coming.

01:26:29.468 --> 01:26:32.014
ASHLEY: Hey guys, I'm here! Did you know I was
coming?

01:26:32.014 --> 01:26:33.342
(laughter)

01:26:33.342 --> 01:26:34.632
MATT: Go ahead and make a religion check.

01:26:34.632 --> 01:26:36.054
LIAM: Don't stab anything.

01:26:36.054 --> 01:26:39.698
ORION: I'm gonna follow suit, but slowly.

01:26:39.698 --> 01:26:40.805
ASHLEY: 17.

01:26:40.805 --> 01:26:50.341
MATT: All right. As you're heading that direction
slowly, best that you can tell right now, this

01:26:50.341 --> 01:26:55.966
room is definitely a small temple built to-- and
the name kind of escapes you, the words trying to

01:26:55.966 --> 01:26:59.709
form in your head for a second, and then
eventually you come to realize this is a chapel to

01:26:59.709 --> 01:27:05.383
Laduguer. Laduguer is the deity of the duergar.
It's the god that basically freed them from their

01:27:05.383 --> 01:27:10.516
original enslavement from the illithids, and they
worship as a pinnacle of power,

01:27:10.516 --> 01:27:12.125
strength, and conquest.

01:27:12.125 --> 01:27:17.212
ORION: I make it up to where those guys are.

01:27:17.212 --> 01:27:18.217
MATT: All right.

01:27:18.217 --> 01:27:19.543
TALIESIN: Let's keep searching.

01:27:19.543 --> 01:27:26.982
SAM: Hey, what's the darkness right next to me? Is
there a door there? What is that?

01:27:26.982 --> 01:27:29.064
MATT: There is a door right over here.

01:27:29.064 --> 01:27:30.672
SAM: Oh. I'm gonna open it.

01:27:30.672 --> 01:27:36.409
MATT: Okay. All right. So you go ahead and open
the door. It opens up into what you can

01:27:36.409 --> 01:27:45.351
immediately see is a chamber that is some kind of
magical laboratory. You see in the far corner,

01:27:45.351 --> 01:27:54.552
hunched, a robed duergar, and as you open the
door, there's a slight sound, a click sound, and a

01:27:54.552 --> 01:28:00.241
jet of greenish fume begins to spray up into your
face. Make a constitution save.

01:28:00.241 --> 01:28:06.167
SAM: Oh, god. I don't even know what that is!
(laughs) 15.

01:28:06.167 --> 01:28:08.915
MATT: 15? All right.

01:28:08.915 --> 01:28:17.726
So you take 11 points of poison damage.
However, you can feel the poison forcing its way

01:28:17.726 --> 01:28:21.096
into your lungs. You manage to back out of the
cloud in time and cough it up and your general

01:28:21.096 --> 01:28:25.318
physical well-being-- you resist most of the
effects of the poison. However, this poison fume

01:28:25.318 --> 01:28:30.804
trap did appear to go off and as the smoke slowly
dissipates, you hear a chuckle

01:28:30.804 --> 01:28:32.310
across the other side.

01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:34.414
ORION: As I hear the noise, I--

01:28:34.414 --> 01:28:36.900
MATT: You don't hear the noise, you're too far
away.

01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:38.272
ORION: Oh, shit.

01:28:38.272 --> 01:28:40.107
MATT: You guys do hear it, though.

01:28:40.107 --> 01:28:42.851
LAURA: Okay, I come over there and see what the--
what just happened.

01:28:42.851 --> 01:28:48.439
MATT: Okay, as you rush over, Scanlan's backed up
away and you can see there's this chamber here.

01:28:48.439 --> 01:28:50.374
LAURA: Is the poison still in the air, or is it--

01:28:50.374 --> 01:28:52.947
MATT: It's dissipated at this point. It's thin
enough. You still can smell it, and it smells

01:28:52.947 --> 01:28:56.301
awful, like a very, very heavy, electrical
fire-type smell.

01:28:56.301 --> 01:28:57.580
LAURA: So I can see that guy?

01:28:57.580 --> 01:28:58.666
MATT: Yeah.

01:28:58.666 --> 01:29:02.544
LAURA: So should I notch an arrow and try to hit
him?

01:29:02.544 --> 01:29:03.892
MATT: It's up to you. What're you going to do?

01:29:03.892 --> 01:29:05.073
LAURA: All right, I attack him, then!

01:29:05.073 --> 01:29:06.254
MATT: All right, go for it then.

01:29:06.254 --> 01:29:07.903
ASHLEY: Attack him! Get him!

01:29:07.903 --> 01:29:13.337
LAURA: Shabang! Oh, dang it, I didn't do it. I
meant to Hunter's Mark him and transfer it over,

01:29:13.337 --> 01:29:14.720
but that's okay, I didn't say it.

01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:15.972
MATT: You didn't say it this time.

01:29:15.972 --> 01:29:18.145
LAURA: That's 30. For the first.

01:29:18.145 --> 01:29:19.466
LIAM: You did say shabang.

01:29:19.466 --> 01:29:21.119
LAURA: I did say shabang, and 16 for the second.

01:29:21.119 --> 01:29:24.003
MATT: Okay, both hit. Go ahead and roll damage on
each.

01:29:24.003 --> 01:29:25.779
ASHLEY: Hit it.

01:29:25.779 --> 01:29:28.199
(music flares up)

01:29:28.199 --> 01:29:31.300
LAURA: Well, sort of. 15 and eight.

01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:33.443
MATT: 15 and eight. All right.

01:29:33.443 --> 01:29:35.799
LIAM: The music is on.

01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:40.843
MATT: All right. So both arrows you've been firing
over the top. He's kind of hard to see with the

01:29:40.843 --> 01:29:43.905
table and from being crouched in the corner, but
both arrows still manage to barely make their

01:29:43.905 --> 01:29:48.557
mark. One kind of pins him against the wall, and
he looks at his shoulder briefly, looks back at

01:29:48.557 --> 01:29:51.993
you, raises his hand, as he begins muttering
something under his breath. As he does, your arrow

01:29:51.993 --> 01:29:56.941
(shnk) through his hand and he tries to shake it,
and now he's pinned to the wall with an arrow in

01:29:57.001 --> 01:29:58.190
the middle of his hand.

01:29:58.190 --> 01:29:59.386
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah!

01:29:59.386 --> 01:30:00.988
LAURA: Trinket! Oh no, I used two attacks.

01:30:00.988 --> 01:30:01.868
MATT: Yeah.

01:30:01.868 --> 01:30:02.887
LAURA: Dang it.

01:30:02.887 --> 01:30:08.436
MATT: You can still tell Trinket to move. What are
you gonna do?

01:30:08.512 --> 01:30:12.498
LAURA: No, no no, I'm gonna hold him there, 'cause
he's already in the room.

01:30:12.498 --> 01:30:16.440
MATT: Okay, got you. All right, so what are you
guys doing over in the temple?

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.458
LIAM: Exiting.

01:30:18.458 --> 01:30:19.638
MATT: All right.

01:30:19.638 --> 01:30:23.009
MARISHA: No! Look and see if there's anything
cool, first. What was that thing that's covered up

01:30:23.009 --> 01:30:24.872
by the blanket on the altar?

01:30:24.872 --> 01:30:26.774
MATT: You keep walking towards it?

01:30:26.774 --> 01:30:28.916
MARISHA: Yeah. What's up with that?

01:30:28.916 --> 01:30:31.884
MATT: You make your way, you look at the top of
the dais where the altar is, and on top you can

01:30:31.884 --> 01:30:37.888
see the black cloth that is wrapped over it. The
scent gets to you before the actual visual. It's

01:30:37.888 --> 01:30:45.950
freshly rotting flesh of some kind, and as you
glance over, you can see there is a heart that has

01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:49.886
been cut from a body and it's at the point where
the blood has coagulated and begin to become

01:30:49.886 --> 01:30:53.000
thick. It's roughly dwarven size.

01:30:53.206 --> 01:30:58.856
MARISHA: I get up and I grab it in my mouth.

01:30:58.856 --> 01:31:00.697
MATT: Okay. It tastes disgusting.

01:31:00.697 --> 01:31:07.133
MARISHA: And then I walk over to Vax and I lay it
at his feet. I kind of nudge it with my nose.

01:31:07.133 --> 01:31:09.434
MATT: She got you a heart.

01:31:09.434 --> 01:31:15.249
LIAM: I scritch Keyleth behind the ear, but nudge
it aside with my toe and exit the room.

01:31:15.249 --> 01:31:16.618
MATT: Okay.

01:31:16.618 --> 01:31:22.559
LIAM: I did scritch her ears, but I'm going to
continue down to the end of the hall.

01:31:22.559 --> 01:31:25.490
MATT: This way?

01:31:25.490 --> 01:31:26.701
LIAM: Yeah.

01:31:26.701 --> 01:31:30.452
MATT: Okay, you make your way into what looks like
a giant foyer, into a secondary entrance in the

01:31:30.452 --> 01:31:32.090
side of the fortress.

01:31:32.090 --> 01:31:33.909
LIAM: I just walk all the way over to the corner,
stealthing.

01:31:33.909 --> 01:31:35.406
MATT: Make a stealth check.

01:31:35.406 --> 01:31:37.640
LIAM: It's high, it's 28.

01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:42.949
MATT: 28, got it, okay. So, as you make your way
through, you eventually careen to this corner. You

01:31:42.949 --> 01:31:46.982
can see another hallway, what appears to be
another room of some kind. You also glance back

01:31:46.982 --> 01:31:49.824
and see there are two sets of stairways that go up
and down.

01:31:49.824 --> 01:31:51.094
LIAM: What's behind me?

01:31:51.094 --> 01:31:53.487
MATT: This is a giant foyer that leads outside of
the fortress.

01:31:53.487 --> 01:31:54.893
LIAM: And the edge of the map this way?

01:31:54.893 --> 01:32:00.940
MATT: This way here? This way? This comes to an
abrupt end at that point, a rocky wall into the

01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:03.292
mountain itself that it's buttressed up against.

01:32:03.292 --> 01:32:05.961
LIAM: Okay, I'm gonna keep coming this way,
stealthing.

01:32:05.961 --> 01:32:08.995
MATT: All right. As you move through--

01:32:08.995 --> 01:32:13.249
LAURA: What's happening with that dude I-- are you
doing all this while I just pin down--

01:32:13.249 --> 01:32:15.441
LIAM: Yeah. I don't know what's going on back
there. I'm just walking around.

01:32:15.441 --> 01:32:21.769
MATT: So, you glance in this room. There's an open
walkway and what appears to be another barrack

01:32:21.769 --> 01:32:23.513
section, also completely empty.

01:32:23.513 --> 01:32:27.996
LIAM: Screw that. Do I see a door for this room
that's still darkened out? Then I'm gonna

01:32:27.996 --> 01:32:29.528
keep sliding along the wall.

01:32:29.528 --> 01:32:35.220
MATT: Okay, as you slide along here, to make your
way around to a door there.

01:32:35.282 --> 01:32:38.608
LIAM: Okay. Pressing my hand, just to see if I can
check any for traps.

01:32:38.608 --> 01:32:39.874
MATT: Okay.

01:32:39.874 --> 01:32:43.005
LIAM: 26.

01:32:43.005 --> 01:32:46.054
MATT: 26, all right. The door does not appear to
be trapped.

01:32:46.054 --> 01:32:48.041
TALIESIN: I'm gonna be heading in that direction
anyway.

01:32:48.041 --> 01:32:49.343
MARISHA: Agreed. Same here.

01:32:49.343 --> 01:32:50.257
MATT: Okay.

01:32:50.257 --> 01:32:52.289
LIAM: I would like to stealth through the door.

01:32:52.289 --> 01:32:57.074
ORION: Before I leave, I carefully examine that
statue.

01:32:57.074 --> 01:33:00.774
MATT: Okay, what are you examining?

01:33:00.774 --> 01:33:05.592
ORION: The facial features of the god, the deity,
right? Is that what he is?

01:33:05.592 --> 01:33:10.093
MATT: Yeah. Okay, so you look at the face of
Laduguer. You can see it's very, very old, it's

01:33:10.093 --> 01:33:15.145
very well-crafted. You can see a lot of very
meticulous craftsmanship went into its creation.

01:33:15.145 --> 01:33:23.479
It almost glistens with a perfection that is out
of place in an area that is so covered in soot and

01:33:23.479 --> 01:33:27.417
various other volcanic activity-based mineral
deposits.

01:33:27.417 --> 01:33:33.968
ORION: I'm gonna do a quick arcana check, just to
see if there's any kind of mystical thing around

01:33:33.968 --> 01:33:36.507
it or anything like that. And it's 19.

01:33:36.507 --> 01:33:42.429
MATT: Okay. There is some sort of a hum to the air
that has an arcane element to it, but you are

01:33:42.429 --> 01:33:45.555
unable to pinpoint what it necessarily means or
what the source is.

01:33:45.555 --> 01:33:49.997
ORION: Interesting. Knowing that, I kind of gather
my thoughts and I head towards where the rest of

01:33:49.997 --> 01:33:51.041
the group is.

01:33:51.041 --> 01:33:56.483
MATT: Okay, so, while you're opening the door, the
mage in the far corner kind of looks about

01:33:56.483 --> 01:34:04.143
sporadically and looks down at the arrow in its
hand and its shoulder and just kind of fearfully,

01:34:04.143 --> 01:34:10.643
"Wait wait wait! Wait. Stop. Don't attack. Let's
have a conversation."

01:34:10.643 --> 01:34:13.705
LAURA: Speak fast. Before I kill you.

01:34:13.705 --> 01:34:18.989
MATT: He leans forward, kind of pulling the arrow
out of the doorway. (groans in pain) Starts

01:34:18.989 --> 01:34:20.487
hobbling towards you a little bit.

01:34:20.487 --> 01:34:23.333
LAURA: Can we all-- we go in the room and Trinket
goes up next to him and, like,

01:34:23.333 --> 01:34:24.833
gets all up in his face?

01:34:24.833 --> 01:34:31.057
MATT: Okay. As you both enter, both of you make
constitution saving throws. As two more plumes of

01:34:31.057 --> 01:34:34.137
poison (pff) out of the ground as both you and
Trinket walk in.

01:34:34.137 --> 01:34:36.114
LIAM: Good.

01:34:36.114 --> 01:34:37.717
LAURA: 15?

01:34:37.717 --> 01:34:39.534
MATT: 15, okay. And for Trinket as well.

01:34:39.534 --> 01:34:46.055
LAURA: Oh, I should've been so smart, but I
wasn't.

01:34:46.055 --> 01:34:50.397
(laughter)

01:34:50.397 --> 01:34:53.326
LAURA: 14 for Trinket.

01:34:53.326 --> 01:34:55.883
MATT: Okay. You take seven points of poison
damage.

01:34:55.883 --> 01:34:57.153
LAURA: Okay.

01:34:57.153 --> 01:35:00.210
MATT: Trinket, however, takes 14 points of poison
damage.

01:35:00.210 --> 01:35:01.935
LAURA: Oh man. What did I get, seven?

01:35:01.935 --> 01:35:04.882
MATT: Seven. And Trinket is currently considered
poisoned.

01:35:04.882 --> 01:35:06.182
LAURA: Oh no!

01:35:06.182 --> 01:35:07.634
SAM: What does that mean?

01:35:07.634 --> 01:35:11.193
MATT: It means disadvantage on attack rolls,
disadvantage on ability checks.

01:35:11.193 --> 01:35:12.591
LAURA: That's okay.

01:35:12.591 --> 01:35:17.644
MATT: And now there's a bear coughing and kind of
thrashing about the room. The table it bumps into

01:35:17.644 --> 01:35:19.181
and it kind of topples over.

01:35:19.181 --> 01:35:21.995
LAURA: Is this like a turn thing or can I do
something?

01:35:21.995 --> 01:35:25.887
MATT: Well, this is just a reactionary moment of
you guys coughing and trying to get out of this

01:35:25.887 --> 01:35:26.889
poisonous fume.

01:35:26.889 --> 01:35:29.851
LAURA: I mean, can I quickly cast Protection from
Poison on Trinket?

01:35:29.851 --> 01:35:30.807
MATT: You can, yes.

01:35:30.807 --> 01:35:31.886
LAURA: Okay. I do that.

01:35:31.886 --> 01:35:32.880
MATT: Okay.

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:34.164
LAURA: And that cures it.

01:35:34.164 --> 01:35:35.862
MATT: That completely removes the poison?

01:35:35.862 --> 01:35:36.963
LAURA: Yes it does.

01:35:36.963 --> 01:35:37.721
MATT: Okay.

01:35:37.721 --> 01:35:38.676
LAURA: Yay Trinket!

01:35:38.676 --> 01:35:42.423
MATT: Well done. So that's your action. You now,
as you are checking the door and you open it up,

01:35:42.423 --> 01:35:46.576
you hear all this commotion going off to the side
now. Scanlan, you're over there as well, watching

01:35:46.576 --> 01:35:49.723
as more plumes of these poisonous smoke bits.

01:35:49.723 --> 01:35:53.012
SAM: If I get close to the door without going
through it, can I see the guy?

01:35:53.012 --> 01:35:59.632
MATT: You can move over and look, you can just
barely make out his form. It is a dark room that

01:35:59.632 --> 01:36:03.582
is currently filled with a slowly dissipating
green cloud so it's hard to make him out.

01:36:03.582 --> 01:36:12.096
SAM: Okay, well then I will just-- fuck (laughs).
Well, if I can't see him

01:36:12.096 --> 01:36:14.083
then I will just yell at him.

01:36:14.083 --> 01:36:15.023
MATT: All right.

01:36:15.023 --> 01:36:20.434
SAM: I'll yell with Vicious Mockery. I don't like
you very much for poisoning me and my friends,

01:36:20.434 --> 01:36:22.341
you're a poopy head!

01:36:22.341 --> 01:36:24.093
(laughter)

01:36:24.093 --> 01:36:25.067
MARISHA: So vicious.

01:36:25.067 --> 01:36:26.330
LAURA: That is threatening.

01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:29.240
MARISHA: Damn.

01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:33.003
SAM: Ooh. That does seven points of damage.

01:36:33.003 --> 01:36:37.674
MATT: Seven points from Vicious Mockery? All
right!

01:36:37.674 --> 01:36:40.012
(laughter)

01:36:40.012 --> 01:36:41.743
MATT: I don't know how that works.

01:36:41.743 --> 01:36:43.640
SAM: It's Vicious Mockery. It's an attack.

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:44.802
MATT: That's crazy.

01:36:44.802 --> 01:36:47.675
LIAM: That's, like, 80 points of damage!

01:36:47.675 --> 01:36:51.717
MARISHA: And who said that words couldn't hurt
people?

01:36:51.717 --> 01:36:54.105
TALIESIN: And bonus damage to his mother, wherever
she may be.

01:36:54.105 --> 01:36:58.257
MARISHA: Sticks and stones can break my bones, but
words can hurt.

01:36:58.257 --> 01:37:02.091
MATT: Okay. So it has to make a will saving throw,
against your DC. It rolls a three. It does not.

01:37:02.091 --> 01:37:08.629
So, as you shout out into this room, the currently
fearful duergar mage kind of glances, eyes slide

01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:12.960
about, hears these words and you see him wrack his
head for a second with a sudden sense of

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.566
self-loathing and disappointment.

01:37:15.566 --> 01:37:18.571
(laughter)

01:37:18.571 --> 01:37:23.465
MATT: His hands drop and it looks like for a
minute his intent to begin muttering some sort of

01:37:23.465 --> 01:37:25.758
incantation is momentarily distracted.

01:37:25.758 --> 01:37:27.148
ORION: Nice!

01:37:27.148 --> 01:37:29.283
MATT: All right, awesome.

01:37:29.283 --> 01:37:30.465
ASHLEY: Can I start moving back?

01:37:30.465 --> 01:37:32.924
MATT: Yeah, you can start moving back this way.

01:37:32.924 --> 01:37:36.483
LIAM: I hear that, but I'm still going to poke my
head stealthily through the door and see what I

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:38.547
see. Do I need a new stealth check or?

01:37:38.547 --> 01:37:39.756
MATT: Yes you do.

01:37:39.756 --> 01:37:47.270
LIAM: Okay, great. So that is a 32.

01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:51.630
MATT: All right, you glance inside at what looks
to be some sort of a training room. There are--

01:37:51.630 --> 01:37:55.928
most of the floor itself is stone, and in the far
corner there is a large section that is mainly

01:37:55.928 --> 01:38:01.216
just sand and dirt and there are a number of
wooden training structures. You know, various

01:38:01.216 --> 01:38:06.239
shields and wooden bars that are used as a means
of training for weaponry. There's what looks like

01:38:06.239 --> 01:38:08.721
a giant rack of weapons, full of arms and stuff.

01:38:08.721 --> 01:38:10.634
LIAM: Anything good-looking?

01:38:10.634 --> 01:38:14.119
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:15.284
LIAM: One.

01:38:15.284 --> 01:38:18.299
MATT: Most of the materials in this room look like
the basic duergar fare.

01:38:18.299 --> 01:38:19.924
LIAM: These don't look very good.

01:38:19.924 --> 01:38:22.337
TALIESIN: I was going to run in and take a look
around anyway so--

01:38:22.337 --> 01:38:31.114
MATT: (laughs) Okay. As you run in, go ahead and
make a dexterity saving throw.

01:38:31.114 --> 01:38:33.500
TALIESIN: God damn it. Okay.

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:36.360
SAM: (sings) Traps, traps, traps-traps-traps.

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:37.631
TALIESIN: 24.

01:38:37.631 --> 01:38:46.184
MATT: All right, so. You take ten points of
lightning damage as you feel a tile on the ground

01:38:46.184 --> 01:38:52.266
trigger and then spring up, and as it does, you
hear this sudden high-pitched whine as blue energy

01:38:52.266 --> 01:38:57.477
streaks up from the floor, runs through your body.
Thankfully, you manage to dive out of the way and

01:38:57.477 --> 01:39:03.145
touch the ground to ground the energy, minimizing
the damage. But yeah, you triggered (laughs)

01:39:03.145 --> 01:39:08.222
triggered a trap plate. You're beginning to get
the sense that a lot of this tactic of this

01:39:08.222 --> 01:39:12.099
fortress now has been to lead you guys through
a--

01:39:12.099 --> 01:39:14.050
MARISHA: Maze?

01:39:14.050 --> 01:39:15.524
MATT: A maze of traps.

01:39:15.524 --> 01:39:16.864
SAM: A labyrinth.

01:39:16.864 --> 01:39:19.828
LIAM: Before we hurt ourselves any longer, we
should--

01:39:19.828 --> 01:39:24.643
LAURA: We've got to kill this guy. Or talk to him
at least.

01:39:24.643 --> 01:39:27.171
LIAM: We need to get to the main event here.

01:39:27.171 --> 01:39:35.455
MATT: All right. At this point, Kima is now-- As
Kima hears you shouting all these curses into the

01:39:35.455 --> 01:39:41.029
room, Kima pushes past you, and pushes past you.
You can see Kima coming into the room behind you

01:39:41.029 --> 01:39:47.518
guys. Steps over the broken table, down in front
of the circle, and grabs the mage by the front of

01:39:47.518 --> 01:39:52.455
his robe, pulling him into her face. The mage at
this point is still kind of reeling from the fact

01:39:52.455 --> 01:39:55.112
that you managed to strike him so deeply in the
heart of his hearts.

01:39:55.112 --> 01:39:57.003
SAM: He's just not a nice man.

01:39:57.003 --> 01:40:02.430
MATT: However, Kima, with a look of absolute death
in her face, grabs him and pulls him forward and

01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:07.425
says, "Listen, where is the rest of your fucking
army?"

01:40:07.484 --> 01:40:09.994
She's going to make an intimidation check.

01:40:10.036 --> 01:40:11.648
TALIESIN: Yeah! Damn.

01:40:11.648 --> 01:40:14.901
MATT: He does not succeed in resisting that.

01:40:14.901 --> 01:40:15.959
LAURA: Yes!

01:40:15.959 --> 01:40:19.225
MATT: The duergar is pressed against the wall now,
and she's slamming him against the back of a

01:40:19.225 --> 01:40:26.998
bookshelf. "Look, all right, they're
waiting for you up there, all right? You're not

01:40:27.043 --> 01:40:31.041
"going to survive this. At this point, the entire
city's probably waiting for you in the outside of

01:40:31.041 --> 01:40:36.208
"the fortress and those that are upstairs are
well-prepared. Okay? Your best chance of survival

01:40:36.208 --> 01:40:42.800
"is laying down your arms and surrendering. I'm
looking out for your best interests here."

01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:44.192
LIAM: Kill this asshole.

01:40:44.192 --> 01:40:45.489
MARISHA: Kill him.

01:40:45.489 --> 01:40:49.562
MATT: Kima, who is still holding him against
there, you can see her hand releases the scruff

01:40:49.562 --> 01:40:54.964
and he takes a deep breath for a second. But
before he can finish exhaling, she goes in,

01:40:54.964 --> 01:40:59.168
immediately grabbing his throat and squeezing it
extremely tight. As she does, you see his tongue,

01:40:59.176 --> 01:41:02.691
dangling out the side of his mouth (strangling
noises) as she's cutting off his entire air

01:41:02.691 --> 01:41:09.235
supply. She pulls forward and takes the greatsword
and begins to slowly push it into his abdomen. As

01:41:09.235 --> 01:41:13.347
she does, he starts screaming in terrible pain.
You can see her just slowly pushing the blade

01:41:13.347 --> 01:41:19.840
through his body into the bookcase behind. As she
does, she goes, "You're gonna tell me, right now,

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:25.883
"who they have waiting for us upstairs." As she
begins to push all the way to the hilt now, he's

01:41:25.883 --> 01:41:30.878
pinned up against the bookcase and probably a
portion of the stonework behind him. He's now got

01:41:30.878 --> 01:41:36.237
blood pouring out the sides of his face and
outside the front of his nose. The duergar being held

01:41:36.283 --> 01:41:43.093
up against the wall says, "Whatever you haven't
killed. The army's probably up with the king

01:41:43.093 --> 01:41:52.434
"himself. They're all waiting for you and I hope
they piss on your body when they're done!" At

01:41:52.434 --> 01:41:59.274
which point she takes the blade and twists it. As
she does, he gives this guttural yelp and his eyes

01:41:59.274 --> 01:42:03.739
just go blank. Blanker than the duergar eyes
normally are.

01:42:03.739 --> 01:42:06.488
ORION: I make it to the doorway and go, what is
going on in here?

01:42:06.488 --> 01:42:11.397
LAURA: Are there any-- taking that in-- any
healing potions or anything in

01:42:11.397 --> 01:42:13.373
here that we could use?

01:42:13.373 --> 01:42:15.529
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

01:42:15.529 --> 01:42:21.906
SAM: Can I look at the door and see if the trap
will go off again if we step through it again?

01:42:21.906 --> 01:42:23.297
MATT: Perception check.

01:42:23.297 --> 01:42:26.194
SAM: 20.

01:42:26.194 --> 01:42:31.364
MATT: Looks like, from glancing about the room and
getting a feel for it, there were three traps that

01:42:31.364 --> 01:42:35.131
were all placed directly at the front of the door,
basically to give him a point of defense, they've

01:42:35.131 --> 01:42:37.784
all been triggered, so you don't have to worry
about any more in this room.

01:42:37.784 --> 01:42:39.350
LAURA: Is this still considered the Underdark?

01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:40.396
MATT: This is, yes.

01:42:40.396 --> 01:42:41.416
LAURA: Oh, cool!

01:42:41.416 --> 01:42:42.737
SAM: I'm going to go in and look around some
more.

01:42:42.737 --> 01:42:44.554
MATT: You're looking around as well?

01:42:44.554 --> 01:42:46.500
SAM: Look around for potions and stuff.

01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:51.132
LAURA: Oh, that's considered the-- aw, I could have
been rolling twice for all these damn things!

01:42:51.202 --> 01:42:52.974
MATT: (sings) Remember your abilities.

01:42:52.974 --> 01:42:54.340
LAURA: (sings) 25.

01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:55.400
MATT: Okay.

01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:57.637
SAM: Who's the singer here, people?

01:42:57.637 --> 01:43:04.298
MATT: Sorry, Scanlan. So, as Kima pulls the blade
from its body, kicking it off the greatsword and

01:43:04.298 --> 01:43:07.880
wiping it across the leather on the side-- the
leather that you gave to her! And a little part of

01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:09.407
you is like, (sadly) hmm.

01:43:09.407 --> 01:43:11.386
LIAM: That's all right. Worth it. This halfling's
hot.

01:43:11.386 --> 01:43:17.251
MATT: So you guys made your way back, Clarota's
there, against the corner, and Grog rushes over,

01:43:17.251 --> 01:43:20.242
just feeling like he was ready for action. "What's
going on?"

01:43:20.242 --> 01:43:22.336
ASHLEY: You're too late.

01:43:22.336 --> 01:43:26.042
MARISHA: This might be a good time to stop for a
moment.

01:43:26.042 --> 01:43:29.445
MATT: That's up to you guys, as I say, do you guys
want to take a short rest?

01:43:29.445 --> 01:43:31.145
LAURA: Did I find any potions? Did I find
anything?

01:43:31.145 --> 01:43:39.388
MATT: Yes. Glancing around the room, you manage to
find two potions of healing, one potion of

01:43:39.388 --> 01:43:40.722
superior healing.

01:43:40.722 --> 01:43:41.823
ALL: Ooh.

01:43:41.823 --> 01:43:44.596
LAURA: What is that? That's major.

01:43:44.596 --> 01:43:45.903
MARISHA: That's cool.

01:43:45.903 --> 01:43:49.411
MATT: You also find one vial of some sort of
weird, viscous yellow liquid

01:43:49.411 --> 01:43:50.953
that you cannot identify.

01:43:50.953 --> 01:43:56.814
MARISHA: Oh, don't open that. Who knows how long
those guards had to be staked out here?

01:43:56.814 --> 01:43:58.299
Don't open that.

01:43:58.299 --> 01:44:01.300
SAM: Can I do a-- can I investigate it or arcana
it?

01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:05.774
MATT: Sure, you can give it a go.

01:44:05.774 --> 01:44:07.569
SAM: Yeah. That's a one.

01:44:07.569 --> 01:44:08.432
LAURA: Oh good.

01:44:08.432 --> 01:44:11.703
SAM: Oh wait, no, that's a seven. These dice are
horrible. Anyway, it doesn't matter. It's bad.

01:44:11.703 --> 01:44:17.935
MATT: It looks delicious. No, actually, you can't
make out, it has some changing color as you kind

01:44:17.935 --> 01:44:24.003
of swirl the bottle and watch the texture inside
shift and change with the centrifugal force. You

01:44:24.003 --> 01:44:27.548
can't make out anything about its intent, but it
does feel like it's a potion

01:44:27.548 --> 01:44:28.634
created with some effect.

01:44:28.634 --> 01:44:29.982
SAM: Tiberius, do you want to drink this?

01:44:29.982 --> 01:44:37.112
ORION: No! What is it? I check it for 18.

01:44:37.112 --> 01:44:38.229
SAM: For what?

01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:40.325
ORION: For whatever you're trying to hand to me.

01:44:40.325 --> 01:44:47.430
MATT: 18 arcana? Okay. You take a look at it. It
definitely is magical, you don't have a lot of

01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:54.074
experience with alchemy but you gather that the
effect that it would have upon imbibement would be

01:44:54.074 --> 01:44:58.065
to alter your physical form in some way, you just
don't know the specific effects.

01:44:58.065 --> 01:45:01.364
ORION: Absolutely, Scanlan, I'll take that for
now. And I put it in my pouch.

01:45:01.364 --> 01:45:04.027
TALIESIN: Let's take a short rest.

01:45:04.027 --> 01:45:09.641
MATT: So, as you guys all kind of enter this room,
this brief safe zone to take a short rest, if you

01:45:09.641 --> 01:45:12.810
feel you want to heal yourself up and regain any
short rest-based abilities, do so.

01:45:12.810 --> 01:45:15.090
MARISHA: Can we talk about what this duergar just
told us?

01:45:15.090 --> 01:45:16.999
LAURA: Can we go to the bathroom before we do
that?

01:45:16.999 --> 01:45:22.167
MATT: That's what I was going to say. We can
return-- So we're going to take a quick bathroom

01:45:22.167 --> 01:45:25.760
break, we're going to play the videos again, we'll
return here in just a second, as the next element

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:28.614
of the attack on Emberhold continues.

01:45:28.614 --> 01:45:32.785
MARISHA: Oh, and this is your last chance because
after the break we'll pick a winner for the

01:45:32.785 --> 01:45:40.810
Espionage giveaway. So, last chance if you want to
tweet @EspionageMakeup and #CriticalRole and look

01:45:40.810 --> 01:45:45.001
at our sweet nails! They're awesome. They're
cool.

01:45:45.001 --> 01:45:47.534
MATT: (whispers) Galaxies! All right, see you guys
in a second.

01:45:47.534 --> 01:45:50.295
ORION: I have text and whatnot.

01:45:50.295 --> 02:01:27.903
[break]

02:01:27.903 --> 02:01:32.712
MATT: Welcome back, guys! All right, so we've had
ourselves sufficiently rested.

02:01:32.712 --> 02:01:40.566
ZAC: Indeed we have. We have a Tabletop Promo Day
kit to give away, because you guys got the 50 subs

02:01:40.566 --> 02:01:42.002
since we started today.

02:01:42.002 --> 02:01:43.142
MATT: Which is awesome.

02:01:43.142 --> 02:01:48.069
ZAC: And we'll give away another one with another
signed poster at the end of the night if you get

02:01:48.123 --> 02:01:55.023
another 50. So we're about to give this away, but
I just want to remind you guys to donate to 826LA.

02:01:55.023 --> 02:02:00.864
That's the group that Critical Role is supporting,
and these guys are here out of the graces of their

02:02:00.864 --> 02:02:05.457
heart, and it would be very helpful for you guys
to donate to them and show your love for Critical

02:02:05.457 --> 02:02:10.142
Role by donating to the charity. We'll post the
link in the chat. Get those donations rolling!

02:02:10.142 --> 02:02:11.344
MATT: Awesome.

02:02:11.344 --> 02:02:12.288
ZAC: Zac out!

02:02:12.288 --> 02:02:15.473
MATT: All right, thank you, Zac! Couple of quick
things. You wanted to announce the Espionage--

02:02:15.473 --> 02:02:22.649
MARISHA: Yes! Our winner for the Espionage Bath
Bombs Tabletop from @espionagemakeup goes to

02:02:22.649 --> 02:02:30.599
(drumroll) Danny Carr. Who is @Eleine35. So,
Danny, I'm pretty sure you follow me on Twitter,

02:02:30.599 --> 02:02:35.328
just PM me your address and I'll get these out to
you. And thank you!

02:02:35.328 --> 02:02:38.173
MATT: Yeah, did you follow him? Because you have
to follow him--

02:02:38.173 --> 02:02:41.525
MARISHA: Oh, I have to follow-- Oh, well then I'll
follow Danny right now.

02:02:41.525 --> 02:02:47.730
MATT: Awesome! Also, as a heads-up, guys, we've
had some people perpetually asking us about the

02:02:47.730 --> 02:02:49.446
shirts that we made.

02:02:49.446 --> 02:02:52.417
ORION: You mean these shirts?

02:02:52.417 --> 02:03:01.481
MATT: That shirt right there. So, we have a-- it's
a temporary-- it's very basic, but we have up, if

02:03:01.481 --> 02:03:05.542
you guys ever want to go to critrole.com, we have
a limited run of those shirts currently available

02:03:05.542 --> 02:03:06.606
for purchase.

02:03:06.606 --> 02:03:09.479
MARISHA: Very limited, like once they're gone,
they're gone.

02:03:09.479 --> 02:03:14.076
LAURA: It's less than-- probably less than 15 of
each size, less than that, probably. It was a

02:03:14.076 --> 02:03:15.178
small amount.

02:03:15.178 --> 02:03:18.618
LIAM: I was wearing mine earlier today and I only
rolled 20s. Only.

02:03:18.618 --> 02:03:28.902
MARISHA: It's true. So, it's www.critrole.com,
and, yeah, and the site is still under

02:03:28.902 --> 02:03:35.006
construction, so. But we managed to rush it out,
and I wanna give a huge shout-out to Michael

02:03:35.006 --> 02:03:38.023
Whitesman, who's a big friend of ours, for helping
us make the website

02:03:38.023 --> 02:03:39.590
ORION: Thanks, Whitey!

02:03:39.590 --> 02:03:43.959
MARISHA: @whitesly, if you want to bug him, and,
yeah, so, if you buy--

02:03:43.959 --> 02:03:46.101
ORION: That's his nickname! It's not like a--

02:03:46.101 --> 02:03:48.754
MARISHA: Whitesly! His last name is Whitesly.

02:03:48.754 --> 02:03:52.538
ORION: I know. But I said, "What's up Whitey,"
like, to him personally, and then they look at me

02:03:52.538 --> 02:03:54.885
like, "Oh my lord, that's so racist."

02:03:54.885 --> 02:03:56.201
(laughter)

02:03:56.201 --> 02:03:57.924
ORION: And I'm like, no, no, it's his nickname.
It's okay.

02:03:57.924 --> 02:03:59.338
MATT: That is actually his nickname.

02:03:59.338 --> 02:04:01.421
LIAM: I'm just sad that you don't call me Whitey.

02:04:01.421 --> 02:04:03.260
ORION: I mean, I can.

02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:05.509
LIAM: Okay. Let's start. After this game.

02:04:05.509 --> 02:04:12.610
MARISHA: Anyways. Anyways, you can go buy t-shirts
now, which was the whole point of that. At

02:04:12.610 --> 02:04:16.649
critrole.com. And there's a limited run. Once
they're gone, they're gone.

02:04:16.649 --> 02:04:21.739
MATT: The cost includes shipping. We'll get--
we're packaging them ourselves. We'll have,

02:04:21.739 --> 02:04:24.943
hopefully, more in the future, but this is the
first attempt at trying to do something like this

02:04:24.943 --> 02:04:26.013
for you guys, so--

02:04:26.013 --> 02:04:29.739
MARISHA: Yeah. We're doing this all ourselves just
to, just 'cause-- See how this works. You guys--

02:04:29.739 --> 02:04:32.491
LAURA: And that includes the shipping, that's why
the price is--

02:04:32.491 --> 02:04:36.445
ASHLEY: So future t-shirts-- Were you guys saying
something, like it would be artwork from--

02:04:36.445 --> 02:04:43.705
MARISHA: Yes, this was, we got this from
@rusegafdi. He wore this at Tabletop Day, so--

02:04:43.705 --> 02:04:45.792
LAURA: A very similar design, so yeah.

02:04:45.792 --> 02:04:50.489
MARISHA: Yeah, so we're-- we decided we're going
to do, like, fan-designed t-shirts. So, once every

02:04:50.489 --> 02:04:55.811
so often, we'll do a fan-designed t-shirt, and
yes. And then--

02:04:55.811 --> 02:04:57.866
but they'll all be limited, so yeah!

02:04:57.866 --> 02:05:01.400
MATT: Yeah. Shipping, shipping is included with
the price, guys, don't worry. But yeah. So,

02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:04.698
anyway, check that out! Thank you guys so much,
and let's go ahead

02:05:04.698 --> 02:05:06.415
and get back to the game proper.

02:05:06.415 --> 02:05:10.307
CREW: Hey, the t-shirts are sold out already.
They're now sold out. They bought all of them.

02:05:10.307 --> 02:05:12.525
MARISHA: T-shirts are sold out!

02:05:12.525 --> 02:05:13.666
ORION: Wait, what?

02:05:13.666 --> 02:05:16.085
TALIESIN: We didn't even finish telling you
people!

02:05:16.085 --> 02:05:17.963
LAURA: No they're not.

02:05:17.963 --> 02:05:19.394
TALIESIN: Let us finish our sentence first!

02:05:19.394 --> 02:05:23.693
MATT: Okay, so, so, so the limited run was very
limited--

02:05:23.693 --> 02:05:27.317
MARISHA: Holy shit!

02:05:27.317 --> 02:05:29.084
MATT: I guess we'll have to order some more,
then.

02:05:29.084 --> 02:05:32.551
SAM: Uh, mental note: make more t-shirts.

02:05:32.551 --> 02:05:34.545
MARISHA: We didn't know! We didn't know!

02:05:34.545 --> 02:05:38.416
MATT: We were gauging interest. I guess there's
interest.

02:05:38.416 --> 02:05:46.428
MARISHA: I'm sorry! Now I almost feel guilty.
Congratulations to the 100 people who got 'em.

02:05:46.428 --> 02:05:52.513
ORION: Hold on. Tiberius is gonna work some magic,
and then try to conjure up a few more. He was

02:05:52.513 --> 02:05:56.517
unaware there was a shortage of, of those-- okay.

02:05:56.517 --> 02:06:00.630
MATT: Sorry, guys, all right, well, we'll-- thank
you guys very much,

02:06:00.630 --> 02:06:02.518
we'll get more to you very soon.

02:06:02.518 --> 02:06:07.876
MARISHA: I don't know what to say! Oh god, I'm
like, going to cry.

02:06:07.876 --> 02:06:12.152
LAURA: Second run, yeah! Just hashtag them
critical role and we'll-- oh, but if you're

02:06:12.152 --> 02:06:14.500
selling them already, there's
somebody that's making really cool t-shirts on

02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:18.510
Redbubble, but if you're making them there, like,
we can't print them too, so, like, just submit

02:06:18.510 --> 02:06:19.977
them to us, and then we can--

02:06:19.977 --> 02:06:25.525
MATT: Yeah, we'll figure it out! Anyway, guys,
thank you so much! Let's get to the game!

02:06:25.525 --> 02:06:27.777
TALIESIN: Thank you! Cool!

02:06:27.777 --> 02:06:32.660
SAM: Guys, guys, the chatroom just solved the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict!

02:06:32.660 --> 02:06:34.386
(laughter)

02:06:34.386 --> 02:06:37.374
MATT: Thank you so much, chat! Nice.

02:06:37.374 --> 02:06:41.592
TALIESIN: We've got a box of stuff coming right
for you right now. Thank you.

02:06:41.592 --> 02:06:48.213
MARISHA: Oh my god, I'm like, shaking.

02:06:48.213 --> 02:06:53.710
MATT: All right, so. For all who didn't get 'em,
we'll have more soon, I promise.

02:06:53.710 --> 02:06:59.671
LIAM: Do you guys like &amp;? What is that?

02:06:59.671 --> 02:07:02.266
MARISHA: (laughs) We didn't know if people liked
our show or not!

02:07:02.266 --> 02:07:07.571
MATT: So. So. So, you've housed yourselves into this
enchanting room, this magical laboratory, and

02:07:07.571 --> 02:07:12.108
taken about a 15-minute rest. You're able to use
any of your unused hit dice to heal yourself up if

02:07:12.188 --> 02:07:13.850
need be. Any--

02:07:13.850 --> 02:07:17.678
ASHLEY: Oh, well, where's everybody at? 'Cause
maybe I can just do a-- some healing up.

02:07:17.678 --> 02:07:19.225
TALIESIN: I just spent a healing surge, so.

02:07:19.225 --> 02:07:20.981
LAURA: Well, he's, well, as far as health goes--

02:07:20.981 --> 02:07:22.563
LIAM: I'm low, yeah, I'm pretty low.

02:07:22.563 --> 02:07:23.710
ASHLEY: Yeah, what are you at?

02:07:23.710 --> 02:07:25.024
MATT: How many hit dice do you have left?

02:07:25.024 --> 02:07:29.431
LIAM: I know, I have, I don't have that many left.
I'm at, like-- I accidentally erased it, but I

02:07:29.431 --> 02:07:31.113
believe I'm at 30?

02:07:31.113 --> 02:07:36.413
ASHLEY: Ooh, yeah, you-- I need to, I'll get on
that. Anybody else? What's everybody at?

02:07:36.413 --> 02:07:39.703
SAM: I can sing to you and give you an extra
little roll.

02:07:39.703 --> 02:07:43.262
LIAM: I'd like you to sing to me, either in the
game or on another day.

02:07:43.262 --> 02:07:45.400
SAM: Are you Vex or Vax? (laughs)

02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:46.724
LIAM: I'm Vix.

02:07:46.724 --> 02:07:50.333
SAM: All right, I'll sing to you and-- are you
gonna use a dice?

02:07:50.333 --> 02:07:55.956
LIAM: Thank you. Ah, let me see how beautiful your
song is

02:07:55.956 --> 02:08:01.483
SAM: (sings) Heal the Vax, make him a better elf.

02:08:01.483 --> 02:08:07.479
SAM and ASHLEY: (sings) For you and for me and the
entire adventuring band.

02:08:07.479 --> 02:08:16.812
SAM: (sings) There are duergar dying, if you cared
enough for the adventurers, you'd bring Vax back

02:08:16.812 --> 02:08:21.578
to help us with the stabby-stab. Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

02:08:21.578 --> 02:08:23.639
LIAM: And please, vaccinate your kids.

02:08:23.639 --> 02:08:27.835
(laughter)

02:08:27.835 --> 02:08:29.820
LIAM: I mean, don't Vax-inate them.

02:08:29.820 --> 02:08:33.085
MATT: Yeah, there's the difference. All right, so.

02:08:33.085 --> 02:08:35.362
SAM: You get a 1d6 for that.

02:08:35.362 --> 02:08:37.463
MATT: So, an extra 1d6 healing to anyone.

02:08:37.463 --> 02:08:39.410
LIAM: Who needs more than one? Three, okay.

02:08:39.410 --> 02:08:44.934
ASHLEY: I healed you, 18, which was actually low,
but I rolled really high for each roll.

02:08:44.934 --> 02:08:46.005
That's my--

02:08:46.005 --> 02:08:50.307
LIAM: Oh, thanks. That's very good. Okay, great, I
am almost tip-top condition, thank you.

02:08:50.307 --> 02:08:51.818
I have a blister.

02:08:51.818 --> 02:08:56.226
MATT: So, as you guys manage to pull yourself out
of your rest mode, you now glance out, and the

02:08:56.226 --> 02:09:01.346
hallway's still quiet, you can hear the movement
of footsteps up above you. What is your intent?

02:09:01.346 --> 02:09:04.618
SAM: To win!

02:09:04.618 --> 02:09:09.971
MARISHA: Okay. Wait, what are we gonna do, 'cause
here's-- there's an army waiting upstairs for us?

02:09:09.971 --> 02:09:14.058
LIAM: They know we're up there, but Kima needs her
stuff, and we need to kind of

02:09:14.058 --> 02:09:15.598
put an end to this problem.

02:09:15.598 --> 02:09:18.332
MARISHA: I'm gonna hop out of tiger form, by the
way, since we rested and stuff.

02:09:18.332 --> 02:09:19.787
SAM: Wait, they're above us?

02:09:19.787 --> 02:09:26.704
LIAM: Yeah, they're all upstairs, including the
mind flayer who vanished from the room we're in,

02:09:26.704 --> 02:09:32.097
so I'm sure he told everyone what's going on. But
they don't know we've found the secret entrance,

02:09:32.097 --> 02:09:36.019
so I think we should go-- Vex'ahlia's correct, we
should use the stairwell

02:09:36.019 --> 02:09:37.381
near the secret entrance.

02:09:37.381 --> 02:09:40.619
ORION: Are we sure there's no other way out of
here, through this particular floor?

02:09:40.619 --> 02:09:42.178
Is that the only exit?

02:09:42.178 --> 02:09:45.864
LAURA: There's-- I mean, there's the front
entrance, there's that door over there, there's

02:09:45.864 --> 02:09:50.097
like two other stairways, but we should use this
back one, by the back entrance.

02:09:50.097 --> 02:09:56.933
LIAM: Also, Lady Kima, our purpose here was to
find you, but your purpose is somewhat greater

02:09:56.933 --> 02:10:01.516
than our own. What do you suggest we do in this
moment?

02:10:01.516 --> 02:10:07.929
MATT: As she stands up, and she holds the
greatsword and swings it a bit. "What I'm seeking

02:10:07.929 --> 02:10:16.514
"lies deeper into this cavern. Whatever is at the
heart of this illithid scourge." And she glances

02:10:16.514 --> 02:10:21.466
over at Clarota-- who's in the back corner, hands
folded-- and there's a slight mental hiss sound in

02:10:21.466 --> 02:10:31.588
her direction. "There's something far darker at
the heart of this temple. I've seen it. But I have

02:10:31.588 --> 02:10:38.959
"my thoughts and my ideas, but I need confirmation
before I speak of any doom-saying. However, the

02:10:38.959 --> 02:10:45.698
"link between those foul creatures and the assault
that's currently mounting against Kraghammer lie

02:10:45.698 --> 02:10:48.439
"upstairs at the center of this duergar people."

02:10:48.439 --> 02:10:53.976
SAM: Oh, here? Here at-- where we are now? Yes,
here?

02:10:53.976 --> 02:10:56.674
MATT: "The link between this K'varn character--"

02:10:56.674 --> 02:11:06.211
LIAM: And let me ask you this. We can be on the
same page, we can go up and fuck shit up. However,

02:11:06.211 --> 02:11:12.712
your weapons and armor-- would they be a great
help? Should they be our short-term purpose, or

02:11:12.712 --> 02:11:15.537
should we just go up and try to end this problem?

02:11:15.537 --> 02:11:20.598
MATT: "To be honest, we've entirely lost the
element of surprise. I would not wish to sacrifice

02:11:20.643 --> 02:11:27.061
"as foolishly for a few additional trinkets of my
own when I feel that this should do well enough,

02:11:27.061 --> 02:11:30.615
"as long as we manage to work together and be smart
about this."

02:11:30.615 --> 02:11:36.432
LAURA: So we should potentially just leave this
castle for now and go find K'varn, rest up--

02:11:36.432 --> 02:11:37.720
SAM: No, no, no.

02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:39.750
LIAM: No, Kima is saying this is the main event.

02:11:39.750 --> 02:11:46.724
SAM: She just said there's a link upstairs. The
link from-- to K'varn that we need to--

02:11:46.724 --> 02:11:48.735
LAURA: I get it! Okay. Yeah.

02:11:48.735 --> 02:11:51.888
MATT: "How do you think K'varn is able to send
these armies up again and again towards the back

02:11:51.888 --> 02:11:53.268
"door of Kraghammer?"

02:11:53.268 --> 02:11:54.486
LAURA: Right.

02:11:54.486 --> 02:11:58.127
MATT: "Besides, if we go on and leave them as they
are, who's to say they wouldn't come up behind us,

02:11:58.127 --> 02:12:00.601
"and then we're fighting a two-sided front once we
get there?"

02:12:00.601 --> 02:12:03.190
LAURA: Then let's-- We gotta go upstairs.

02:12:03.190 --> 02:12:07.844
LIAM: Vox Machina, our years are short. Let's make
good use of them.

02:12:07.844 --> 02:12:10.106
SAM: Let's leave this decision up to Grog.

02:12:10.106 --> 02:12:12.372
ORION: Absolutely not!

02:12:12.372 --> 02:12:13.523
(laughter)

02:12:13.523 --> 02:12:18.542
MATT: Grog's standing there clutching his
greataxe. "I say, I haven't been able to kill much

02:12:18.542 --> 02:12:22.355
"since we got here. Let's kill something!"

02:12:22.355 --> 02:12:24.543
ORION: That's a terrible idea.

02:12:24.543 --> 02:12:26.613
LAURA: Have some ale before we go out, Grog.

02:12:26.613 --> 02:12:30.920
MATT: "Oh, yeah, of course." And he goes into his
bag of holding, and pulls out his now half-empty

02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:36.264
cask, and you see him frown as he hears it clink
around. He pours everyone a small drink, to what

02:12:36.264 --> 02:12:37.848
is now an empty cask.

02:12:37.848 --> 02:12:40.673
LAURA: This could potentially kill us all.

02:12:40.673 --> 02:12:42.329
TRAVIS: Vox Machina.

02:12:42.329 --> 02:12:44.555
ALL: Vox Machina!

02:12:44.555 --> 02:12:47.115
LAURA: Scanlan had a great idea, though. Should we
talk about what Scanlan wants to do?

02:12:47.115 --> 02:12:50.946
SAM: Ah, yes, I have an idea. But also, are there
two stairs up to the top floor?

02:12:50.946 --> 02:12:53.129
LIAM: There's multiple.

02:12:53.129 --> 02:13:00.824
SAM: Perhaps we should use more than one. One,
half of our band go up, create a diversion. The

02:13:00.824 --> 02:13:05.813
other half sneak up and kill, kill, kill. That's
one option. The other option--

02:13:05.813 --> 02:13:07.521
LIAM: Pike leads the diversion group.

02:13:07.521 --> 02:13:09.719
ASHLEY: Definitely the stealthy ones with me.

02:13:09.719 --> 02:13:11.792
(laughter)

02:13:11.792 --> 02:13:19.778
SAM: Ah, I do have an idea about gaining the upper
hand on our first meeting with this army that's

02:13:19.778 --> 02:13:22.462
upstairs. An intimidation technique of some sort.

02:13:22.462 --> 02:13:25.063
MARISHA: You're not going to kill another pony,
are you?

02:13:25.063 --> 02:13:26.456
SAM: I can't anymore.

02:13:26.456 --> 02:13:27.942
MARISHA: Good.

02:13:27.942 --> 02:13:34.656
SAM: Much as I would love to. No, but we've heard
over our eavesdropping that some of these duergar

02:13:34.656 --> 02:13:44.411
bastards are scared of that strange chimera sort
of hodgepodge, human centipede thing? We could be

02:13:44.411 --> 02:13:49.594
one of those with a little bit of deception, and
all of us sort of piling on each other. We could

02:13:49.594 --> 02:13:52.725
act like a big scary monster and go up and freak
the fuck out of them.

02:13:52.725 --> 02:13:55.812
MARISHA: Ah! That's actually a really good idea.

02:13:55.812 --> 02:14:00.697
LAURA: -- all of us piled on Grog and Trinket and
you as the bases, and we become this--

02:14:00.697 --> 02:14:06.391
SAM: They would probably be, at least for the
moment, intimidated a bit, and we could get a few

02:14:06.391 --> 02:14:10.388
licks in before they realized we're just a pile of
idiots running at them.

02:14:10.388 --> 02:14:11.834
(laughter)

02:14:11.834 --> 02:14:13.406
LAURA: I like it.

02:14:13.406 --> 02:14:19.178
MARISHA: So we're basically gonna be like three
kids Little Rascals-style on each other's

02:14:19.178 --> 02:14:21.661
shoulders with a giant coat?

02:14:21.661 --> 02:14:24.614
SAM: But that could be the diversion, at least.

02:14:24.614 --> 02:14:28.037
MARISHA: Okay, well then, why don't-- I actually
like this idea. Why don't we have a few of our

02:14:28.037 --> 02:14:32.684
stealthy members, why don't we have the twins be
in the shadows, and picking people off while--

02:14:32.684 --> 02:14:34.668
LAURA: That's true, 'cause I've got range, so that
makes sense.

02:14:34.668 --> 02:14:37.831
MARISHA: Right, why don't we have some of our
ranged people-- I'll transform. I can transform

02:14:37.831 --> 02:14:41.450
into-- how about a giant scorpion? That sounds
fun.

02:14:41.450 --> 02:14:42.811
SAM: Can you transform into anything?

02:14:42.811 --> 02:14:45.824
MARISHA: I can transform into beasts. They have to
be beasts.

02:14:45.824 --> 02:14:50.770
SAM: How about the type of beast that we know
would scare them, like that big triceratops thing

02:14:50.770 --> 02:14:52.848
that we saw with the big metal thing on it.

02:14:52.848 --> 02:15:00.691
MARISHA: I can be a rhinoceros-- I can be, like--
Can I do dinosaurs? I can be a dinosaur, right?

02:15:00.691 --> 02:15:02.429
That's a new thing I can be, right?

02:15:02.429 --> 02:15:03.894
MATT: Up to a certain point.

02:15:03.894 --> 02:15:11.799
LIAM: What if you were a scorpion, with a
dragonborn tail sliding around and a gnome on your

02:15:11.799 --> 02:15:12.980
front leg and a--

02:15:12.980 --> 02:15:20.945
MARISHA: Well here's, oh wait wait, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay, okay, hang on, hang on, hang on,

02:15:20.945 --> 02:15:26.831
this might be crazy-- wonder what would
happen if I drank that weird yellowish potion?

02:15:26.831 --> 02:15:29.727
While I'm a monster?

02:15:29.727 --> 02:15:32.471
LAURA: No, It could be poison, though.

02:15:32.471 --> 02:15:36.177
MARISHA: But I'm wondering if you can, like, if I
can transform into a monster and then you with

02:15:36.177 --> 02:15:38.234
Polymorph can maybe just transform.

02:15:38.234 --> 02:15:40.434
ORION: Stop talking, stop talking! Hold on.

02:15:40.434 --> 02:15:42.144
(laughter)

02:15:42.144 --> 02:15:43.644
MARISHA: You don't have to snap at me.

02:15:43.644 --> 02:15:46.222
ORION: No, no, no, you're brilliant, your
highness.

02:15:46.222 --> 02:15:49.971
MARISHA: Oh, thank you. I mean.

02:15:49.971 --> 02:15:54.295
ORION: I have an idea, I have an idea.

02:15:54.295 --> 02:15:56.915
LIAM: We're off the rails, here.

02:15:56.915 --> 02:15:59.331
LAURA: Tell it to us, Tiberius, what's the idea?

02:15:59.331 --> 02:16:01.720
SAM: Does it involve shitting on a bed?

02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:03.267
(laughter)

02:16:03.267 --> 02:16:05.235
ORION: Eventually, actually, yes.

02:16:05.235 --> 02:16:06.878
TALIESIN: Aren't you empty yet?

02:16:06.878 --> 02:16:15.418
ORION: This is what's going to happen. As far as
we know, they're all duergar up there, correct?

02:16:15.418 --> 02:16:21.981
LAURA: Mostly, except for the mind flayers. And
another big monster probably, they might have--

02:16:21.981 --> 02:16:25.776
ASHLEY: Which I saw in a vision. I think that's
what's controlling them

02:16:25.776 --> 02:16:30.511
LAURA: Oh no, that's K'varn. No, no, no, he's at
the other one.

02:16:30.511 --> 02:16:34.494
ASHLEY: Sorry, read it wrong.

02:16:34.494 --> 02:16:40.915
ORION: This is what will happen. Those who can go
stealth, we will creep up there. I will go

02:16:40.915 --> 02:16:46.892
invisible myself. I will be in front. You closely
behind me.

02:16:46.892 --> 02:16:48.620
SAM: He has a name.

02:16:48.620 --> 02:17:02.019
ORION: Vax. There we go. You closely behind me,
and whoever else can stealth follows suit. I will

02:17:02.019 --> 02:17:04.901
cast Alter Self and turn myself into their god.

02:17:04.901 --> 02:17:06.398
SAM: Their god?

02:17:06.398 --> 02:17:07.624
ALL: K'varn?

02:17:07.624 --> 02:17:10.156
MARISHA: But you don't know what he looks like.

02:17:10.156 --> 02:17:11.828
LAURA: Oh, or into that other thingie.

02:17:11.828 --> 02:17:13.362
ORION: I absolutely know what he looks like.

02:17:13.362 --> 02:17:15.480
MATT: You mean Laduguer?

02:17:15.638 --> 02:17:17.480
ORION: We just saw his statue.

02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:19.194
MARISHA: Well. that's not K'varn though.

02:17:19.194 --> 02:17:27.913
ORION: But that's who they worship. As I give my,
whatever the hell I come up with to say at that

02:17:27.913 --> 02:17:29.511
particular time--

02:17:29.511 --> 02:17:32.027
SAM: Maybe you should think it first, think it
through first.

02:17:32.027 --> 02:17:42.848
ORION: As soon as the mind flayers catch on, and I
turn to Clarota, and I turn to Kima, that's when

02:17:42.848 --> 02:17:50.347
all of you will strike at them first. The rest of
you will wait 'til I shoot off a couple of

02:17:50.347 --> 02:17:56.107
Fireballs at the duergar once they figure out
we're full of crap. 'Cause I'm sure that might

02:17:56.107 --> 02:18:01.930
happen unless I'm super convincing, which I hope
that's the case-- But I think that's our best bet

02:18:01.930 --> 02:18:04.812
to keep a certain element of surprise.

02:18:04.812 --> 02:18:09.213
MARISHA: So wait, so wait, are you going to be
their god, and I'm still going to also be a crazy

02:18:09.213 --> 02:18:12.985
monster, as like your pet crazy monster, with our
stealthy team, or just--

02:18:12.985 --> 02:18:15.659
TALIESIN: I think the only thing better than their
god would be their god on top of a giant

02:18:15.659 --> 02:18:16.900
scorpion.

02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:19.003
LAURA and MARISHA: Ooh!

02:18:19.003 --> 02:18:20.824
LIAM: I have faith in you, Tiberius.

02:18:20.824 --> 02:18:23.097
MARISHA: You'll be like Xerxes.

02:18:23.097 --> 02:18:33.574
ASHLEY: Can I cast, 'cause I've been wanting to
use Thaumaturgy. Which can make your voice three

02:18:33.574 --> 02:18:35.242
times as louder.

02:18:35.242 --> 02:18:38.397
MATT: At the moment he would be speaking, yeah.

02:18:38.397 --> 02:18:40.725
ASHLEY: At the moment he'd be speaking, okay, so
let's do that.

02:18:40.725 --> 02:18:42.730
LAURA: Oh, that's going to be so cool.

02:18:42.730 --> 02:18:43.961
MARISHA: Some theatrics.

02:18:43.961 --> 02:18:50.823
LIAM: I love it when a good plan comes together.

02:18:50.823 --> 02:18:56.727
SAM: So some of us are stealthing, you're being a
big god who talks loud and is riding a scorpion.

02:18:56.727 --> 02:19:02.583
ASHLEY: So maybe I'll tuck behind him, on top of
you the scorpion, and then when you're getting

02:19:02.583 --> 02:19:06.915
ready to talk I'll just (whoosh) and then you'll--
your voice will be, you know, you'll have--

02:19:06.915 --> 02:19:08.281
LIAM: Yeah, that's good, that's good.

02:19:08.281 --> 02:19:12.089
SAM: How about this-- so, just to clarify, are we
all going up the same staircase, or are we going

02:19:12.175 --> 02:19:14.550
up two separate staircases, Vex and Vax--

02:19:14.550 --> 02:19:18.404
LAURA: I think we should just go up the same
staircase. There's too many of them. If we split

02:19:18.404 --> 02:19:19.931
up we could just all die.

02:19:19.931 --> 02:19:22.756
SAM: You don't know what-- there could be a
million rooms up there.

02:19:22.756 --> 02:19:27.337
LIAM: We have no idea what's up there, but
Tiberius has got a plan, I like it.

02:19:27.337 --> 02:19:29.762
LAURA: If he's the god, we just go in behind him
as the god.

02:19:29.762 --> 02:19:33.977
ASHLEY: What if we did like your Dimension Door?
Is it too not very god-like if he's coming up the

02:19:33.977 --> 02:19:35.927
staircase like, hey?

02:19:35.927 --> 02:19:37.769
SAM: The Dimension Door's off the table.

02:19:37.769 --> 02:19:44.809
LIAM: Tiberius, Tiberius. Tibs.

02:19:44.809 --> 02:19:48.625
SAM: But don't use the god thing. But don't use
the god thing until we get to the big group. The

02:19:48.625 --> 02:19:53.743
big thing, if you see a guard, don't turn into a
god, you gotta see like more than five people

02:19:53.743 --> 02:19:55.569
before you turn into a god.

02:19:55.569 --> 02:19:56.687
LIAM: Tiberius.

02:19:56.687 --> 02:19:57.651
ORION: Yes, Vax?

02:19:57.651 --> 02:20:01.439
LIAM: Do you intend to go up one of the other
stairways? I believe this one by the entrance, the

02:20:01.439 --> 02:20:06.543
secret entrance we came in, will afford us the
element of surprise. Do you think you want to go

02:20:06.543 --> 02:20:08.186
up one of the others?

02:20:08.186 --> 02:20:09.582
ORION: No, let's go up that one.

02:20:09.582 --> 02:20:11.538
LIAM: And make a distraction, right? Your plan is
to make a distraction.

02:20:11.538 --> 02:20:12.872
ORION: Yes, of course.

02:20:12.872 --> 02:20:14.234
LIAM: You're a brave dragonborn.

02:20:14.234 --> 02:20:19.519
MARISHA: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on
the party. Everyone stay close.

02:20:19.519 --> 02:20:22.719
LIAM: Who's the stealth party, not you, you and
me, you.

02:20:22.719 --> 02:20:25.577
MARISHA: Well, all of us, all of us I guess, until
we get upstairs.

02:20:25.577 --> 02:20:28.542
LAURA: Potentially all of us will be stealthed
except for Tiberius, and you who is a scorpion,

02:20:28.542 --> 02:20:30.141
and you who's riding behind Tiberius.

02:20:30.141 --> 02:20:33.600
ASHLEY: I'm riding on her, so I probably won't be
rolling for stealth.

02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:35.385
MATT: Uh.

02:20:35.385 --> 02:20:36.688
ASHLEY: Just kidding.

02:20:36.688 --> 02:20:37.561
MATT: You'll be rolling.

02:20:37.561 --> 02:20:39.961
ASHLEY: I probably won't roll well, just putting
it out there.

02:20:39.961 --> 02:20:50.747
MATT: You hear in the back of your mind this
subtle, soft, echoing chuckle. "You're all crazy.

02:20:50.747 --> 02:20:52.972
"I like it."

02:20:52.972 --> 02:20:54.445
(laughter)

02:20:54.445 --> 02:20:59.855
MATT: At which point, Kima, who's listening to all
this with a look of kind of awe and curiosity

02:20:59.855 --> 02:21:03.164
says, "You know, for once? I actually agree with
the thing."

02:21:03.164 --> 02:21:04.866
(laughter)

02:21:04.866 --> 02:21:08.966
MATT: "All right." Takes her greatsword in her
hands. "Lead the way."

02:21:08.966 --> 02:21:15.356
ASHLEY: So you guys are stealthing up first?

02:21:15.356 --> 02:21:20.103
MARISHA: We all have Pass Without a Trace as long
as you stand close enough.

02:21:20.103 --> 02:21:23.398
LIAM: Wait, wait for the inspiration.

02:21:23.398 --> 02:21:27.146
SAM: I have some inspiration dice to give out,
that I can give out as bonus actions. Can I give

02:21:27.146 --> 02:21:29.158
it out before we go into battle?

02:21:29.158 --> 02:21:32.315
MATT: I would say like momentarily, right
beforehand.

02:21:32.315 --> 02:21:36.915
SAM: Okay, good to know. But I can't mass give it
out, just have to give it to one person.

02:21:36.915 --> 02:21:39.735
MATT: It's one of those things where it has to be
in the moment when the adrenaline's pumping, I

02:21:39.735 --> 02:21:42.042
think, for it to last into the combat.

02:21:42.042 --> 02:21:47.459
SAM: Okay, and do we want to send Clarota and Kima
off through a different staircase so we have at

02:21:47.459 --> 02:21:49.663
least a backup plan?

02:21:49.737 --> 02:21:53.192
LAURA: No, no, no stick together. Too big of a
group of an army upstairs to split us up.

02:21:53.192 --> 02:21:54.728
LIAM: Don't split the party.

02:21:54.728 --> 02:22:01.192
SAM: In those action movies, when there's one guy
who goes away for a while, he comes back at the

02:22:01.192 --> 02:22:03.027
end and saves the day. If we did that--

02:22:03.027 --> 02:22:05.294
LAURA: That's not going to be us!

02:22:05.294 --> 02:22:08.105
LIAM: We few, we happy few.

02:22:08.105 --> 02:22:10.457
(laughter)

02:22:10.457 --> 02:22:13.235
LIAM: About to go and do something very stupid.
Let's do it.

02:22:13.235 --> 02:22:16.638
MATT: So you are venturing up which stairway?

02:22:16.638 --> 02:22:18.648
LAURA: The secret one, the one by-- in the storage
room.

02:22:18.648 --> 02:22:22.215
MATT: All right. So. You guys--

02:22:22.215 --> 02:22:26.778
MARISHA: We got this. We got this.

02:22:26.778 --> 02:22:31.578
LAURA: Oh no, Grog fell over. Oh my gosh.

02:22:31.578 --> 02:22:45.369
MARISHA: It's been a good day. What are you going
to say? Are you thinking about this?

02:22:45.369 --> 02:22:46.854
Think about something.

02:22:46.854 --> 02:22:47.992
ORION: Okay.

02:22:47.992 --> 02:22:49.932
MARISHA: Start thinking about this now.

02:22:49.932 --> 02:22:52.280
LIAM: There are rooms up there.

02:22:52.280 --> 02:22:57.024
TALIESIN: What's the name of the god again?

02:22:57.024 --> 02:23:01.346
MARISHA: Laduguer.

02:23:01.346 --> 02:23:07.028
ASHLEY: Can I take off my armor right now?

02:23:07.028 --> 02:23:18.823
MATT: You'd become a soft target. All right, you
guys all make your way up, and you're all

02:23:18.823 --> 02:23:24.847
squeezing into this tiny, tiny room. You're all
shoulder-to-shoulder, essentially. You come up to

02:23:24.847 --> 02:23:29.561
the top area, there's a small box, and there is
just a single stone door.

02:23:29.561 --> 02:23:32.308
LAURA: Check for traps.

02:23:32.308 --> 02:23:37.782
LIAM: Excuse me, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, excuse me Kima, sorry,

02:23:37.782 --> 02:23:43.187
sorry, All right, my hands are on the door. I'm
going to check for traps on this door.

02:23:43.187 --> 02:23:47.482
I get a 21.

02:23:47.482 --> 02:23:53.705
MATT: Okay, you take a moment and you place your
hand along this stone surface. You find that

02:23:53.705 --> 02:23:56.102
there's a low hum to it.

02:23:56.102 --> 02:23:57.735
LIAM: Careful, careful, careful.

02:23:57.735 --> 02:24:04.482
MATT: And you can tell that there's a small,
almost like a thin whisper of string laid across

02:24:04.482 --> 02:24:07.061
the very top of the stone, where the wall meets
it.

02:24:07.061 --> 02:24:14.249
LIAM: Of course I can, of course I can. I'm going
to take care of this, hold on. Yeah, this is

02:24:14.249 --> 02:24:16.272
thieves' tools, correct? 26.

02:24:16.272 --> 02:24:24.048
MATT: 26, okay. You come up and you find that this
is a very, very fine hair trigger. This is

02:24:24.048 --> 02:24:29.667
actually a partial enchantment as part of a
magical trap. You know that with the slightest

02:24:29.667 --> 02:24:36.214
hint of false vibration to it, the door shifting
or hitting it in the wrong place will trigger

02:24:36.214 --> 02:24:41.805
whatever this trap is. And so you bring your tools
up, you manage to place one at the base of each

02:24:41.805 --> 02:24:48.570
point at where this arcane silver thread lies
across. Simultaneously, you take your daggers and

02:24:48.570 --> 02:24:52.994
place them underneath the thread at each ends and
sever them both at the same time. The thin whisper

02:24:52.994 --> 02:24:57.585
of a string just slowly glides down and vanishes
into a small sparkle of light.

02:24:57.585 --> 02:25:01.000
SAM: Cut the red wire.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:10.508
LIAM: I'm just going to lay my ear on the door and
see what I can hear. That is 21.

02:25:10.508 --> 02:25:14.479
MATT: Hearing it, you hear what sounds like a low
mutter of somewhere in the neighbourhood of ten to

02:25:14.479 --> 02:25:20.016
15 low voices, and the slow, small shuffling of
many, many, many, many footsteps.

02:25:20.016 --> 02:25:25.030
LIAM: Shuffling, you said? And if I listen for a
moment, do I-- does it continue?

02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:30.316
MATT: It, kind of, couple of footsteps, some
talking, soft footprints. You can hear the

02:25:30.316 --> 02:25:31.541
scraping of metal--

02:25:31.541 --> 02:25:36.466
LIAM: And it's the only way we can go is through
this door, right?

02:25:36.466 --> 02:25:37.913
We're all smooshed into this hallway--

02:25:37.913 --> 02:25:39.537
MATT: There is a hallway this way.

02:25:39.537 --> 02:25:44.361
LAURA: Oh, so we stealth down the other hall, we
try.

02:25:44.361 --> 02:25:51.199
LIAM: So I mooshed everyone away from this hall.

02:25:51.199 --> 02:25:55.513
MATT: The whispers and voices aren't directly on
the other side of this wall, they're just in that

02:25:55.513 --> 02:26:02.367
room echoing through, but you do hear a lot of
people there. All right, so, what are you doing?

02:26:02.367 --> 02:26:07.339
LAURA: Well, well, stealthing down that hallway.
Can we check for traps, check for traps, I look,

02:26:07.339 --> 02:26:08.656
I'm perceiving.

02:26:08.656 --> 02:26:10.947
MATT: (laughs) Roll for perceiving

02:26:10.947 --> 02:26:13.799
(laughter)

02:26:13.799 --> 02:26:16.632
LIAM: 23 for Vax.

02:26:16.632 --> 02:26:20.963
LAURA: Oh, I get twice that, good. Oh, good, that
was way better.

02:26:20.963 --> 02:26:22.722
MATT: (laughs)

02:26:22.722 --> 02:26:25.127
LAURA: Ten.

02:26:25.127 --> 02:26:26.873
MATT: Okay, no traps.

02:26:26.873 --> 02:26:27.972
LAURA: Yay!

02:26:27.972 --> 02:26:35.370
MATT: You both glide your way up and peek around
the corner. What you see immediately are six

02:26:35.370 --> 02:26:42.595
duergar all stationed in this hallway guarding
what looks like two large doors and entrance to

02:26:42.595 --> 02:26:46.741
this main chamber. And they're all just standing
there, weapons ready, looking around.

02:26:46.741 --> 02:26:49.460
SAM: Wait, which is the main chamber that you
just--

02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:51.288
MATT: This big chamber here that you--

02:26:51.288 --> 02:26:53.026
SAM: Oh, that we were listening to at the door.

02:26:53.026 --> 02:26:59.456
LIAM: Vax sneaks back to the group and motions
Tiberius over, and Keyleth over.

02:26:59.456 --> 02:27:01.553
SAM: We're doing this?

02:27:01.553 --> 02:27:07.118
LIAM: One moment, one moment. Lightning,
Lightning, who knows Lightning?

02:27:07.118 --> 02:27:12.735
MARISHA: Are you gonna try to Lightning Bolt an
entire line?

02:27:12.735 --> 02:27:15.826
LIAM: Do you know the magic of lightning? I've
seen you do it before, I've seen you.

02:27:15.826 --> 02:27:19.320
MARISHA: I do know it right now.

02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:24.276
LIAM: You know it? Anyone who knows Lightning,
I've seen it done on the battlefield with us,

02:27:24.276 --> 02:27:26.117
person to person to person.

02:27:26.117 --> 02:27:28.009
SAM: I can do it.

02:27:28.009 --> 02:27:31.398
MATT: Who is up once again, clearing his throat in
your presence.

02:27:31.398 --> 02:27:35.145
SAM: Hi! Scanlan here.

02:27:35.145 --> 02:27:38.494
LIAM: Scanlan, you know how to harness the power
of electricity.

02:27:38.494 --> 02:27:44.965
SAM: I don't wanna brag, but I'm a regular Ben
Franklin over here. He's a guy, he's a gnome I

02:27:44.965 --> 02:27:46.097
knew once.

02:27:46.097 --> 02:27:51.603
MARISHA: Scanlan, can you and I focus our Call
Lightning spells together? To Lightning these--

02:27:51.603 --> 02:27:54.657
SAM: I mean, mine's so fricking powerful.

02:27:54.657 --> 02:27:58.944
LIAM: If Scanlan and one of the others does
Lightning at the same time and it goes through

02:27:58.944 --> 02:28:02.273
that line, we could drop them all at once.

02:28:02.273 --> 02:28:04.475
LAURA: But that's noisy, they'll come out.

02:28:04.475 --> 02:28:07.798
LIAM: It's not that noisy, it's not like armor
banging around.

02:28:07.798 --> 02:28:09.756
LAURA: I think it's gonna be noisy, it's not a
stealthy attack.

02:28:09.756 --> 02:28:11.936
TALIESIN: It's a quick way to get rid of six
people, though.

02:28:11.936 --> 02:28:14.463
ORION: Oh, is that what we need to do?

02:28:14.463 --> 02:28:21.004
LIAM: There's a row of duergar around the corner,
they're all in a line like Radio City, we just--

02:28:21.004 --> 02:28:25.766
if I can get-- Scanlan, if you-- what about you,
Keyleth? Do I remember light-- or do you bring it

02:28:25.766 --> 02:28:29.006
down from above? Tiberius.

02:28:29.006 --> 02:28:30.624
ORION: What, what?

02:28:30.624 --> 02:28:34.842
SAM: Do you want me to shock 'em?

02:28:34.842 --> 02:28:39.182
ORION: Oh, I have an idea. Okay, I'll peek
around.

02:28:39.182 --> 02:28:41.747
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

02:28:41.747 --> 02:28:44.241
ORION: Sweet.

02:28:44.241 --> 02:28:46.408
MARISHA: You have plus ten because of my Pass
Without a Trace.

02:28:46.408 --> 02:28:49.075
LIAM: You've got six duergar in a row. Is there
anything you can do that's--

02:28:49.075 --> 02:28:50.188
ORION: 27.

02:28:50.188 --> 02:28:55.534
MATT: That's when you see this long row of duergar
that are all kind of armored and ready, guarding

02:28:55.534 --> 02:28:57.356
the front of this chamber.

02:28:57.356 --> 02:29:03.771
ORION: I cast Watery Sphere at the end of the last
guy and create a giant ball.

02:29:03.771 --> 02:29:06.571
LIAM: Wait, you're doing it now?

02:29:06.571 --> 02:29:08.952
ORION: What does it look like, Vax?

02:29:08.952 --> 02:29:12.512
MATT: Okay, so this giant water sphere appears. At
which side of the wall?

02:29:12.512 --> 02:29:18.254
ORION: On the last guy. Yeah, and I draw it
towards us.

02:29:18.254 --> 02:29:21.405
LIAM: Vax is grabbing the gnome and tossing him
out to the right,

02:29:21.405 --> 02:29:23.149
out here at the front of the group.

02:29:23.149 --> 02:29:25.506
ORION: And I stop at the last guy.

02:29:25.506 --> 02:29:31.308
MATT: Okay, as the water sphere begins to pull in.
Saving throws, what's your DC?

02:29:31.308 --> 02:29:33.956
ORION: My spell DC, 17.

02:29:33.956 --> 02:29:37.971
MATT: This is a dexterity save? All right.

02:29:37.971 --> 02:29:43.710
SAM: One at a time.

02:29:43.710 --> 02:29:45.869
MATT: All of them fail!

02:29:45.869 --> 02:29:48.213
(cheering)

02:29:48.213 --> 02:29:52.830
MARISHA: This is gonna be cool, this is gonna be
cool. It's gonna put them all in one spot.

02:29:52.830 --> 02:29:54.925
SAM: They were already in a line.

02:29:54.925 --> 02:29:59.224
MARISHA: No, now we can electrocute them and
they're wet!

02:29:59.293 --> 02:30:06.534
MATT: There is now an entire clustered sphere of
water that is containing a mishmash of duergar.

02:30:06.534 --> 02:30:10.899
MARISHA: Lightning Bolt!

02:30:10.899 --> 02:30:16.496
MATT: Call Lightning. All right, so, as Keyleth,
you step forward, out in the hallway, you bring

02:30:16.496 --> 02:30:21.056
your arm up and there's this small cluster of dark
clouds beginning to form and swirl up on the top

02:30:21.056 --> 02:30:26.603
of the 20-foot hallway. As it swirls, you bring
your arm downward, and there's a sudden crack of

02:30:26.603 --> 02:30:31.891
thunder, a loud blasting sound that echoes through
the hallway. As the lightning strikes the center

02:30:31.891 --> 02:30:39.352
of the sphere, the water itself bursts as the
actual cacophonous blast of the lightning loosely

02:30:39.352 --> 02:30:43.108
shakes the aquatic sphere. However, go ahead and
roll damage.

02:30:43.108 --> 02:30:45.285
MARISHA: Do I get any more damage because of
the--

02:30:45.285 --> 02:30:48.320
MATT: You get an additional two dice of damage to
each one of the duergar because they are contained

02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:49.427
in the water.

02:30:49.427 --> 02:30:50.503
ORION: Yeah!

02:30:50.503 --> 02:30:52.290
MARISHA: So 5d10?

02:30:52.290 --> 02:30:53.505
MATT: Correct.

02:30:53.505 --> 02:30:55.021
MARISHA: Do I roll for each one?

02:30:55.021 --> 02:30:59.739
MATT: You just roll once, and that's across the
board for all of them, and they are at a

02:30:59.739 --> 02:31:02.097
disadvantage because they are in the sphere.

02:31:02.097 --> 02:31:03.699
MARISHA: Oh, and they're at a disadvantage?

02:31:03.699 --> 02:31:06.035
ORION: Yeah, yeah, because I'm like holding them
up.

02:31:06.035 --> 02:31:07.882
MARISHA: All right.

02:31:07.882 --> 02:31:10.521
MATT: It's really funny, because two of them
rolled 20s in a row, but they're at a

02:31:10.521 --> 02:31:11.771
disadvantage.

02:31:11.771 --> 02:31:23.569
MARISHA: Nice. Not too shabby. So we have ten, 19
plus 18, bringing it to 28 plus three, 31 plus

02:31:23.569 --> 02:31:25.026
one. 32.

02:31:25.026 --> 02:31:30.645
MATT: Okay. So the sphere explodes, the actual
stone on the ground you can feel shake and shudder

02:31:30.645 --> 02:31:36.245
with the impact of the lightning storm. All but
one of the duergar are blown apart and scattered

02:31:36.245 --> 02:31:44.001
across the wall Akira-style, just (splat) against
the walls. One of them is still in the center of

02:31:44.001 --> 02:31:48.640
the sphere, now looking charred and burnt, and
eyes wide open with anger and frustration.

02:31:48.640 --> 02:31:52.304
MARISHA: Scanlan, go!

02:31:52.304 --> 02:32:02.105
SAM: I say, (chants) you ugly, you ugly, yo mama
says you ugly! And I cast Vicious Mockery.

02:32:02.105 --> 02:32:05.949
(laughter)

02:32:05.949 --> 02:32:09.794
MATT: He rolled a 14 vs the DC which I think is--

02:32:09.794 --> 02:32:10.962
SAM: 19.

02:32:10.962 --> 02:32:12.536
MATT: All right, how much total did you do?

02:32:12.536 --> 02:32:14.641
SAM: Just a five.

02:32:14.641 --> 02:32:16.465
MATT: How much did you do, total?

02:32:16.465 --> 02:32:18.654
MARISHA: 32, total.

02:32:18.654 --> 02:32:27.862
MATT: Hold on. So as the duergar is currently held
aloft in this aquatic sphere, half-charred and

02:32:27.862 --> 02:32:31.629
burnt with pieces of his friends floating in the
water around him, he hears through this kind of

02:32:31.629 --> 02:32:36.822
warbling sound, "You ugly, you ugly," and he sees
everyone kind of step in the hallway clapping with

02:32:36.822 --> 02:32:40.919
you, and he kind of looks around at himself, looks
at his situation... and eventually just gives up

02:32:40.919 --> 02:32:44.497
and takes a big old gulp of water and drowns
inside the aquatic sphere.

02:32:44.497 --> 02:32:45.475
(laughter)

02:32:45.475 --> 02:32:47.497
SAM: Yes! I shamed him to death

02:32:47.497 --> 02:32:49.311
ASHLEY: Amazing.

02:32:49.311 --> 02:32:51.813
MARISHA: (laughs) What a terrible way to die.

02:32:51.813 --> 02:32:57.023
MATT: Good news is, you guys royally screwed over
six duergar, one of which

02:32:57.023 --> 02:32:58.588
you shamed him to death.

02:32:58.588 --> 02:33:00.002
(laughter)

02:33:00.002 --> 02:33:03.766
MATT: You have definitely, however, announced your
presence at the chamber.

02:33:03.766 --> 02:33:13.384
LIAM: Vax spanks Tiberius on the tail and says,
get ready to deity! Going stealth.

02:33:13.384 --> 02:33:16.851
MARISHA: I say-- I go, get on my back, get on my
back, and I piggyback him.

02:33:16.851 --> 02:33:18.714
MATT: You transform?

02:33:18.714 --> 02:33:20.258
ORION: I do.

02:33:20.258 --> 02:33:22.268
MATT: No, Marisha, did you transform?

02:33:22.268 --> 02:33:26.262
MARISHA: Well I'm piggybacking him, just now. I'm
literally just piggybacking Tiberius waiting.

02:33:26.262 --> 02:33:27.878
MATT: Okay, so Tiberius, you leap onto her back.

02:33:27.878 --> 02:33:31.366
ORION: Mm-hm, and I cast Alter Self, and I turn
to--

02:33:31.366 --> 02:33:33.143
LIAM: Scanlan, Vex.

02:33:33.143 --> 02:33:39.303
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast the thing on him.

02:33:39.303 --> 02:33:48.319
MATT: Okay, so you cast Thaumaturgy on him to give
him a vocal emphasis, a roaring, booming voice. Do

02:33:48.319 --> 02:33:50.405
you stay with him or do you move back with the
rest of the group?

02:33:50.405 --> 02:33:55.929
MARISHA: Oh, oh, Pike Pike Pike Pike Pike. What
kind of animal would this god use? Would you know

02:33:55.929 --> 02:34:01.274
what kind of animal the duergar would worship? Do
you know?

02:34:01.274 --> 02:34:02.450
ORION: It's a religion check.

02:34:02.450 --> 02:34:04.206
MATT: Religion check.

02:34:04.206 --> 02:34:10.544
MARISHA: What kind of animals he might like? You
know, check out-- you know, animals.

02:34:10.544 --> 02:34:14.996
ASHLEY: 14.

02:34:14.996 --> 02:34:21.538
MATT: You have no idea. You know the deity exists,
you don't know of any sort of animal, beast or

02:34:21.538 --> 02:34:24.712
creature symbolism that would befit a duergar
god.

02:34:24.712 --> 02:34:26.162
ASHLEY: I have no idea.

02:34:26.162 --> 02:34:33.072
MARISHA: I guess a scorpion, a scorpion sounds
good? Scorpion. Giant Scorpion.

02:34:33.141 --> 02:34:40.248
MATT: Keyleth's form shifts. As you see a bunch of
arachnid-like legs sprawl out the side of her

02:34:40.248 --> 02:34:45.682
torso, her form condenses into a dark, chitinous shell
as two giant claws form out the side of her body,

02:34:45.755 --> 02:34:50.436
and a giant poison stinger curls up from behind.
Tiberius kind of holds on during the

02:34:50.436 --> 02:34:51.608
transformation--

02:34:51.608 --> 02:34:54.508
ASHLEY: I'm going to go back, because if they see
me, then they'll know something's fishy.

02:34:54.508 --> 02:35:00.920
MATT: All right, the rest of you are here. So. You
feel this kind of divine energy cascade around

02:35:00.920 --> 02:35:04.946
your throat. You can feel your vocal cords
themselves are temporarily infused with some sort

02:35:04.946 --> 02:35:10.612
of divine presence. You've transformed yourself
now into the visage of this duergar deity.

02:35:10.612 --> 02:35:13.760
Standing at probably a good-- what height are you
going at?

02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:17.003
ORION: How tall are the--

02:35:17.003 --> 02:35:22.091
MATT: The duergar are about four-and-a-half feet
tall.

02:35:22.091 --> 02:35:23.619
ORION: So let's make him six feet tall.

02:35:23.619 --> 02:35:25.893
MATT: All right, six-foot-tall duergar standing
there.

02:35:25.893 --> 02:35:32.208
LAURA: The two of us get back by the other twin
door, and get ready to bust into that entrance.

02:35:32.208 --> 02:35:34.765
SAM: I'm with them. We're the stealth party.

02:35:34.765 --> 02:35:45.747
LIAM: I'm in fact nudging Grog away from this door
towards the front towards Tiberius. I don't know,

02:35:45.747 --> 02:35:47.029
they're not that strong.

02:35:47.029 --> 02:35:48.941
MATT: What are you doing? Grog says, "Which way,
which way do I go?"

02:35:48.941 --> 02:35:52.199
LIAM: Vax kicks Grog in the butt and sends him
forward. Go help Tiberius!

02:35:52.199 --> 02:35:54.654
MATT: "I'm walking back for you."

02:35:54.654 --> 02:35:59.603
LAURA: Grog, don't do that. Not that far. Grog,
come back, because if they see him--

02:35:59.603 --> 02:36:04.881
ORION: No, stay in the corner, Grog. Wait 'til I
say help me, and then come kill everything.

02:36:04.881 --> 02:36:08.377
MATT: He looks like he's listening. Mostly.

02:36:08.377 --> 02:36:09.589
(laughter)

02:36:09.589 --> 02:36:11.887
MARISHA: Back him up. Back him up.

02:36:11.887 --> 02:36:20.771
MATT: You hear shifting in the doorway from the
front where you guys are. What's the plan? What's

02:36:20.771 --> 02:36:21.663
doing what?

02:36:21.663 --> 02:36:23.033
SAM: Who's going in first?

02:36:23.033 --> 02:36:27.462
ORION: Is this going to be the entrance where
we're going in?

02:36:27.462 --> 02:36:29.267
LAURA: Yeah you bust in and be a god.

02:36:29.267 --> 02:36:31.057
MARISHA: Oh, are we busting in?

02:36:31.057 --> 02:36:36.072
LAURA: When you give it, we'll go in the other
way.

02:36:36.072 --> 02:36:37.453
MARISHA: Fuck if I know.

02:36:37.453 --> 02:36:39.505
ORION: That's your job. Bust the door open.

02:36:39.505 --> 02:36:42.886
MATT: All right, go ahead and make an athletics
check.

02:36:42.886 --> 02:36:49.215
LIAM: I'm simultaneously checking our door for--
no, I already did. It's unlocked, and untrapped.

02:36:49.215 --> 02:36:50.612
Never mind.

02:36:50.612 --> 02:36:56.451
MARISHA: Giant scorpion. Athletics. Plus my dex,
I'm assuming?

02:36:56.451 --> 02:36:58.469
MATT: No, plus your strength.

02:36:58.469 --> 02:37:01.320
MARISHA: Strength, that's pretty cool, though.
22.

02:37:01.320 --> 02:37:02.511
MATT: A 22.

02:37:02.511 --> 02:37:03.631
MARISHA: I rolled a 19.

02:37:03.631 --> 02:37:07.909
MATT: All right, the doors splinter open. The
doors are actually broken off the hinges.

02:37:07.909 --> 02:37:13.724
ORION: As that happens, I cast Light and I cast
Prestidigitation.

02:37:13.724 --> 02:37:20.936
SAM: Concentrate. Don't cast too much shit.

02:37:20.936 --> 02:37:26.568
ORION: I can't hear what's going on. I hear some
annoyances in the background as I cast

02:37:26.568 --> 02:37:29.681
Prestidigitation to make my voice louder.

02:37:29.681 --> 02:37:34.368
LAURA: No, she already did it. It's three times
louder than it normally would be.

02:37:34.368 --> 02:37:36.413
ORION: Oh, shit.

02:37:36.413 --> 02:37:38.924
MARISHA: So just keep focusing on your Light.

02:37:38.924 --> 02:37:41.435
MATT: As you guys come bursting in--

02:37:41.435 --> 02:37:42.466
LIAM: Holy shit.

02:37:42.466 --> 02:37:44.175
LAURA: Yeah, there's a lot of them.

02:37:44.175 --> 02:37:46.472
MARISHA: Maybe do some Prestidigitation where you
move shit around.

02:37:46.472 --> 02:37:48.974
ASHLEY: Oh ho ho. What!

02:37:48.974 --> 02:37:52.429
MARISHA: Oh! Hello, everybody.

02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:55.862
LIAM and LAURA: (Grog voice) I would like to
rage.

02:37:55.862 --> 02:37:59.029
LAURA: Oh, no. Basilisks!

02:37:59.029 --> 02:38:00.484
LIAM: What?

02:38:00.484 --> 02:38:01.928
LAURA: Those thingies!

02:38:01.928 --> 02:38:05.851
MARISHA: Oh, that's right, they have those pet
basilisks. Remember?

02:38:05.851 --> 02:38:12.782
MATT: So the doors burst open and you guys come
through. All of the duergar stand there with their

02:38:12.811 --> 02:38:17.475
weapons at the ready. You can see in the back, on
this raised platform, where the cloth stops, there

02:38:17.475 --> 02:38:22.827
is two thrones, at the top two duergar sitting on
the thrones at the ready. You can see two kind of

02:38:22.827 --> 02:38:27.586
lizard-like creatures in the back on chained
leashes. However, all of the duergar that are

02:38:27.586 --> 02:38:31.778
ready to strike as you burst through, take a step
back, looking extremely confused about what's

02:38:31.778 --> 02:38:32.561
going on.

02:38:32.561 --> 02:38:35.670
ORION: (shouts) Silence! All of you, silence!

02:38:35.670 --> 02:38:37.398
SAM: We weren't talking.

02:38:37.398 --> 02:38:41.410
ORION: Who knows who I am?

02:38:41.410 --> 02:38:43.888
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:38:43.888 --> 02:38:46.156
MARISHA: Get it. Get it. Get it.

02:38:46.156 --> 02:38:50.055
LIAM: Yep. Yep yep yep yep. Vax is quietly moving
along the back wall.

02:38:50.055 --> 02:38:51.977
SAM: Our door is open?

02:38:51.977 --> 02:38:53.475
LIAM: It is now.

02:38:53.475 --> 02:38:55.499
LAURA: Yeah we're going to try to stealth in and
sneak attack them.

02:38:55.499 --> 02:38:56.741
ORION: 16.

02:38:56.741 --> 02:39:01.152
LAURA: Oh god. Oh god.

02:39:01.152 --> 02:39:13.239
MATT: Okay. The duergar in the front take another
step back, looking both frightened and awed. The

02:39:13.239 --> 02:39:16.928
one nearest to you takes his hammer and throws it to
the ground, and takes a knee.

02:39:16.928 --> 02:39:25.462
ORION: Well, it looks like there's one saved soul
at this point in time.

02:39:25.462 --> 02:39:30.223
MATT: At which point two of the other ones nearby
kind of look at each other and look back at the

02:39:30.223 --> 02:39:35.390
one who's on on the ground. They put their hammers
down, and they kneel as well. At which point, in

02:39:35.436 --> 02:39:41.109
the back, you see the two throned figures stand up.
One of which you can barely see in the dim light

02:39:41.109 --> 02:39:46.308
outside of your Light spell that's currently
gleaming above you. This long,

02:39:46.308 --> 02:39:53.623
almost-touching-the-floor black, braided beard
that drags right over this heavy-set plate of

02:39:53.623 --> 02:40:02.275
jagged black iron metal. A giant sword in his hand.
"You're kneeling below this false idol."

02:40:02.275 --> 02:40:05.169
ORION: Silence!

02:40:05.169 --> 02:40:06.574
MATT: "This imposter!"

02:40:06.574 --> 02:40:10.596
ORION: As I cast-- As I say silence, I blow a big
plume of fire out of my mouth,

02:40:10.596 --> 02:40:12.211
and I cast Control Flames.

02:40:12.211 --> 02:40:16.171
MATT: So the light (pff).

02:40:16.171 --> 02:40:20.440
ORION: I don't cast Control Flames. I just do the
Fireball for effect. I don't do Control Flames,

02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:22.470
because that's a concentration spell.

02:40:22.470 --> 02:40:25.326
MATT: All right, so you do Fireball. Where are you
casting Fireball? Or just doing it to do it?

02:40:25.326 --> 02:40:26.710
ORION: Just (fwoosh).

02:40:26.710 --> 02:40:29.600
MATT: Plume of flame. Roll an intimidation check.

02:40:29.652 --> 02:40:32.242
TALIESIN: You guys, what are you doing right now?

02:40:32.242 --> 02:40:36.792
LIAM: I'm moving along the back wall. I want that
illithid.

02:40:36.792 --> 02:40:38.102
ORION: 18.

02:40:38.102 --> 02:40:41.230
MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check. Who else is
going in there with him?

02:40:41.230 --> 02:40:45.041
LAURA: I go in and stand at the walls next to the
door.

02:40:45.041 --> 02:40:47.132
LIAM: 32.

02:40:47.132 --> 02:40:49.358
MATT: Okay, your stealth roll?

02:40:49.358 --> 02:40:55.706
ASHLEY: I'm so stressed.

02:40:55.706 --> 02:40:58.649
MARISHA: I know! I feel like I'm going to have a
heart attack.

02:40:58.649 --> 02:41:00.523
MATT: So you rolled a--

02:41:00.523 --> 02:41:01.599
ORION: 18.

02:41:01.599 --> 02:41:05.187
MATT: Okay, you can see this figure-- which you
are gathering at this point is probably King

02:41:05.187 --> 02:41:10.956
Murghol-- still holding his sword aloft, looks
back towards his wife who's sitting in the throne

02:41:10.956 --> 02:41:14.512
next to him, who is just standing up kind of
confused.

02:41:14.512 --> 02:41:22.855
ORION: That's right, boy. I am Laduguer! You know,
and you know your deeds as

02:41:22.855 --> 02:41:27.524
of late might upset my rest.

02:41:27.524 --> 02:41:31.842
MATT: All of the duergar are now looking over
their shoulders back towards the king and watching

02:41:31.842 --> 02:41:33.621
this transpire between the two of you.

02:41:33.621 --> 02:41:36.396
ORION: (shouts) All of you, lay down your arms!

02:41:36.396 --> 02:41:37.755
LAURA: 32.

02:41:37.755 --> 02:41:40.734
MATT: 32. You're moving in, everyone else staying
in the hallway?

02:41:40.734 --> 02:41:46.656
ASHLEY: I'm not moving. I'm like this!

02:41:46.656 --> 02:41:53.501
MATT: As you guys push in further and further, the
group that are kneeling move back in sheer fear

02:41:53.501 --> 02:42:00.191
and horror. At which point the king takes a step
down off of the throne area onto the next

02:42:00.191 --> 02:42:09.132
platform, weapons still at his side and says,
"Men, I've trained you. I've raised you. I've fed

02:42:09.132 --> 02:42:11.248
"you and I've kept you alive."

02:42:11.248 --> 02:42:17.427
ORION: And I don't care for you to finish that
sentence! I cast Fireball. Right fucking-- Right

02:42:17.427 --> 02:42:18.595
on him.

02:42:18.595 --> 02:42:21.663
SAM: That's an attack right there.

02:42:21.663 --> 02:42:23.192
ORION: Of course it is!

02:42:23.192 --> 02:42:34.764
MATT: So the blast hits him and a 20-foot radius
that will grab everything in that radius.

02:42:34.764 --> 02:42:40.721
Including you. So go ahead and roll damage. 8d6.

02:42:40.721 --> 02:42:42.201
LIAM: It's all right.

02:42:42.201 --> 02:42:43.624
MARISHA: 8d6.

02:42:43.624 --> 02:42:49.524
LIAM: Heal me, Pike, heal me. Heal me in three
minutes, heal me. This is gonna hurt. This is

02:42:49.524 --> 02:42:50.996
gonna sting.

02:42:50.996 --> 02:42:57.741
MARISHA: Oh, god damn. Come on, you got this.
You got this, Vax.

02:42:57.741 --> 02:42:59.827
SAM: You want it to be a lot, but not too much.

02:42:59.827 --> 02:43:01.794
(laughter)

02:43:01.794 --> 02:43:03.913
LIAM: A little less than 55.

02:43:03.913 --> 02:43:05.326
ORION: Uh, 25.

02:43:05.326 --> 02:43:06.749
MATT: 25, okay.

02:43:06.749 --> 02:43:08.262
ORION: Oh, I'm sorry, 30.

02:43:08.262 --> 02:43:13.365
MATT: Okay, good. So it explodes around them. You
see all of them kind of shield themselves from the

02:43:13.365 --> 02:43:15.438
blast of flame. As it spreads out--

02:43:15.438 --> 02:43:18.591
LIAM: Wait, I'm doing the rogue thing that I can't
remember the name for.

02:43:18.591 --> 02:43:20.059
LAURA and MARISHA: Uncanny Dodge?

02:43:20.059 --> 02:43:21.535
LIAM: No, it's something else.

02:43:21.535 --> 02:43:22.838
ORION: Quickly. Quickly.

02:43:22.838 --> 02:43:28.079
MATT: So while you're looking that up-- The
duergar brace themselves and they have an innate

02:43:28.079 --> 02:43:31.056
natural resistance against things magical in
nature.

02:43:31.056 --> 02:43:32.632
LIAM: Evasion!

02:43:32.632 --> 02:43:36.773
MATT: So they all take the brunt of the damage,
however, it does not do as much as you hoped to

02:43:36.773 --> 02:43:42.841
the group. All of them look hurt, but definitely
not taken out of the fight. The two lizard

02:43:42.841 --> 02:43:47.019
creatures you now have a better look at, you do
see it's familiar. They have numerous sets of

02:43:47.019 --> 02:43:53.377
legs, and though the chains hold them at bay, both
of them glance up instinctually. I want you,

02:43:53.423 --> 02:43:59.540
Tiberius, to make two constitution saving throws.

02:43:59.540 --> 02:44:00.681
SAM: Traps.

02:44:00.681 --> 02:44:01.781
ORION: Yes.

02:44:01.781 --> 02:44:10.968
LIAM: DM. Evasion, if I make a success I get
half-damage, if I fail I get-- If I fail, I get

02:44:10.968 --> 02:44:15.116
half-damage, if I succeed I get no damage. I think
I failed. I got a nine.

02:44:15.116 --> 02:44:20.955
MATT: Yeah you take half-damage. So you take the--
What was the total damage on your Fireball? So you

02:44:20.955 --> 02:44:27.447
take 15 points of fire damage. So as you glance
about the room now, you look over and both of

02:44:27.447 --> 02:44:30.939
these lizard creatures kind of look towards you.
You kind of look back and forth-- there's a

02:44:30.939 --> 02:44:40.567
slight gleam in their eye. Suddenly you feel your
form begin to tighten up, instant. You are

02:44:40.567 --> 02:44:46.621
considered restrained, which means you are at
disadvantage to all your attack rolls and ability

02:44:46.621 --> 02:44:48.048
checks for right now.

02:44:48.048 --> 02:44:52.277
ORION: Hold on, I still have a bonus attack I can
do before that happens, correct?

02:44:52.277 --> 02:44:55.002
MATT: No, this is as it's happening. Your turn is
still happening.

02:44:55.002 --> 02:44:56.014
ORION: I got it.

02:44:56.014 --> 02:44:59.322
MATT: This is all kind of a fluid moment. Things
happen as they happen until initiative is being

02:44:59.386 --> 02:45:03.528
rolled, which is now. So everyone roll
initiative.

02:45:03.528 --> 02:45:05.344
MARISHA: Sneaky sneaky.

02:45:05.344 --> 02:45:10.597
LAURA: Oh, great.

02:45:10.597 --> 02:45:23.547
MATT: All right, so, 25 to 20?

02:45:23.547 --> 02:45:25.427
SAM: Natural 20.

02:45:25.427 --> 02:45:26.717
MATT: Plus your--

02:45:26.717 --> 02:45:27.679
SAM: Nothing.

02:45:27.679 --> 02:45:28.980
MATT: Plus nothing for dex. Okay.

02:45:28.980 --> 02:45:31.499
SAM: Oh, for dex. Plus nothing.

02:45:31.499 --> 02:45:33.468
MATT: Okay, so 25 to 20?

02:45:33.468 --> 02:45:34.355
TALIESIN: 23.

02:45:34.355 --> 02:45:35.549
LIAM: 21.

02:45:35.549 --> 02:45:37.020
MATT: 21, all right, all right.

02:45:37.020 --> 02:45:40.118
TALIESIN: Yeah. Sneak attack.

02:45:40.118 --> 02:45:49.349
MATT: All righty, 20 to 15?

02:45:49.349 --> 02:45:51.066
LAURA: 19.

02:45:51.066 --> 02:45:52.820
ORION: 17.

02:46:00.620 --> 02:46:05.471
MATT: All right, 15 to ten?

02:46:05.471 --> 02:46:08.061
MARISHA: I'm nine.

02:46:08.061 --> 02:46:13.701
ASHLEY: Five. Not to brag.

02:46:13.701 --> 02:46:18.957
MARISHA: (laughs) Big number five.

02:46:18.957 --> 02:46:22.102
MATT: All right.

02:46:27.892 --> 02:46:33.215
MARISHA: I just noticed your shirt. It's really
great.

02:46:36.406 --> 02:46:40.563
SAM: Guys, tune in every week for this kind of
intense action.

02:46:40.563 --> 02:46:43.933
LAURA: Unless we're all dead next week. In which
case--

02:46:43.933 --> 02:46:47.437
LIAM: -- Mama put the coins on my eyes.

02:46:47.437 --> 02:46:52.666
MATT: All right, that brings us to top of the
round. Percy, you're up.

02:46:52.666 --> 02:46:58.386
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold off until-- I'm
actually going to delay my turn until post-Pike.

02:46:58.386 --> 02:47:03.771
ORION: Can I still yell out shit while this is
happening? Even though it isn't my turn?

02:47:03.771 --> 02:47:06.766
MATT: I mean, you can yell like one thing.

02:47:06.766 --> 02:47:09.953
TALIESIN: I'm loud and I've got range, so I'm
going to let the room fill,

02:47:09.953 --> 02:47:14.290
and then I'm going to come in and get some.

02:47:14.290 --> 02:47:19.620
ORION: As this is all going down, I'm going to
yell, those who want to live, throw down your

02:47:19.620 --> 02:47:22.098
arms. That's what I do.

02:47:22.098 --> 02:47:27.097
MATT: Okay. That brings us back to the top. Vax,
you're up.

02:47:27.097 --> 02:47:33.109
LIAM: Okay, I use my bonus action to click my
boots of haste together. And I tap-dance over to

02:47:33.109 --> 02:47:37.932
the illithid, and I'm going to use two daggers to
stab him in his eyeballs.

02:47:37.932 --> 02:47:39.439
MATT: Okay.

02:47:39.439 --> 02:47:41.428
LIAM: First one hits, it's 18.

02:47:41.428 --> 02:47:44.348
MATT: It is a critical because it does not see you
and has not acted yet this combat.

02:47:44.348 --> 02:47:55.088
LIAM: Yeah it is. So I just take my keen dagger
and I shove it in his eyeball. 1d4 is two, plus--

02:47:55.088 --> 02:47:58.570
MARISHA: Feel like I'm going to have a heart
attack.

02:47:58.570 --> 02:48:01.729
TALIESIN: We're going to be fine. It's nothing we
can't handle.

02:48:01.729 --> 02:48:05.011
MARISHA: Nothing we can't handle.

02:48:05.011 --> 02:48:13.727
LIAM: 19, 28, plus 36 is the first dagger into his
eyeball.

02:48:13.727 --> 02:48:14.889
MATT: Okay.

02:48:14.889 --> 02:48:21.727
LIAM: Second dagger also hits for a little less,
for seven points of fire

02:48:21.727 --> 02:48:23.814
damage in his other eyeball.

02:48:23.814 --> 02:48:29.706
MATT: All right. Gotcha. So the first one actually
jams into one of its eyes. It didn't even see you,

02:48:29.706 --> 02:48:34.310
it recoils back, slapping your hand back out of
the way. The other dagger strikes and just gleans

02:48:34.310 --> 02:48:37.515
off its shoulder. However, it turns around with
its other eye and

02:48:37.515 --> 02:48:39.643
it definitely knows you're there.

02:48:39.643 --> 02:48:43.373
LIAM: I'd like to circulate my hands to kind of
carve out the eyeball area.

02:48:43.373 --> 02:48:44.949
(laughter)

02:48:44.949 --> 02:48:46.590
MATT: No, it pushed you off.

02:48:46.590 --> 02:48:48.719
LIAM: Yeah, okay, okay, it's all right.

02:48:48.719 --> 02:48:52.769
MATT: All right. That brings us to Grog.

02:48:52.769 --> 02:48:55.860
SAM: (Grog voice) I would like to rage.

02:48:55.860 --> 02:48:59.393
LIAM: (Grog voice) I would like to go to a whore
house.

02:48:59.393 --> 02:49:04.435
MATT: He goes into a rage. And Grog is going to go
ahead and take his axe with the chain on it and

02:49:04.435 --> 02:49:11.572
throw it toward the first duergar he sees, which
is right here. Throws it. All right, that is a--

02:49:11.572 --> 02:49:16.556
That's going to miss. He rolled a four. Swings
past. He's going to make an athletics check to see

02:49:16.556 --> 02:49:19.941
if he can bring it back. That he succeeds. So he
throws the axe. It swings past the duergar, clangs

02:49:19.941 --> 02:49:24.616
to the ground, uses his chain, he yanks it back,
catches it in his hand. His turn is spent,

02:49:24.616 --> 02:49:26.828
however. Next up is Scanlan.

02:49:26.828 --> 02:49:34.088
SAM: I step into the room, lining myself up with
those two pig, creature, beast things. In a line.

02:49:34.088 --> 02:49:37.036
Yeah. Can I also catch the king or no?

02:49:37.036 --> 02:49:39.903
MATT: No, it has to be a line. It has to go
straight.

02:49:39.903 --> 02:49:44.026
SAM: Going for the guys. I don't want to scald
you. You're already hurting. I'm going to go

02:49:44.026 --> 02:49:48.881
straight across the piggies and make them squeal
with Lightning.

02:49:48.881 --> 02:49:52.436
MATT: All right. At the start of your turn--

02:49:52.436 --> 02:49:54.422
SAM: Oh shit, there's a trap.

02:49:54.422 --> 02:49:58.038
MATT: No, at the start of your turn you come up
and the creature looks over and you guys make eye

02:49:58.038 --> 02:50:01.932
contact. You weren't averting your gaze. Go ahead
and make a constitution save.

02:50:01.932 --> 02:50:09.017
LIAM: Saving throw, saving throw. Come on,
Scanlan, you lucky motherfucker! Roll high.

02:50:09.017 --> 02:50:11.419
SAM: 17, plus what?

02:50:11.419 --> 02:50:12.806
MATT: Plus your constitution modifier.

02:50:12.806 --> 02:50:13.746
SAM: 19.

02:50:13.746 --> 02:50:16.587
MATT: All right, so, as it glances over at you,
there's a shine in its eye, and you feel all of a

02:50:16.587 --> 02:50:20.593
sudden your form, for a second, tense, and you
shrug off the effect, untouched by it. Now, go

02:50:20.593 --> 02:50:22.758
ahead and take your turn.

02:50:22.758 --> 02:50:28.552
SAM: I cast Lightning on the two beasts. 
In a straight line.

02:50:28.552 --> 02:50:30.914
MATT: Okay, so you pull back and you unleash a
lightning bolt.

02:50:30.914 --> 02:50:32.673
It goes streaking across the room.

02:50:32.673 --> 02:50:34.971
SAM: If I can get the king, I'll try.

02:50:34.971 --> 02:50:37.062
MATT: Unfortunately, he's just out of the line
array, but it does streak across and blast both of

02:50:37.062 --> 02:50:41.403
these now visibly basilisks in front of you.

02:50:41.403 --> 02:50:43.662
You hit automatically. Just go ahead and
roll damage.

02:50:43.662 --> 02:50:44.953
(laughter)

02:50:44.953 --> 02:50:47.629
MARISHA: Oh sweet, sweet dice rolls.

02:50:47.629 --> 02:50:49.061
LIAM: Let it rain!

02:50:49.061 --> 02:50:51.352
MARISHA: Let it rain d6s from the sky!

02:50:51.352 --> 02:50:55.005
SAM: 29.

02:50:55.005 --> 02:51:03.010
MATT: 29. One fails its saving throw, one makes
it. So 29 damage to one, and 14 to the other.

02:51:03.010 --> 02:51:07.819
SAM: And then, for bonus action, I inspire Vax
with a little ditty.

02:51:09.585 --> 02:51:11.127
MATT: All right.

02:51:11.127 --> 02:51:18.259
SAM: (sings) I want to sing a song of inspiration,
of inspiration!

02:51:18.259 --> 02:51:20.103
(laughter)

02:51:20.103 --> 02:51:26.503
MATT: All righty, that's it. That ends Scanlan's
turn. King Murghol's turn, now. King Murghol is

02:51:26.503 --> 02:51:33.319
going to-- It sees this blast of lightning streak
past now, as it blasts, just barely passing in

02:51:33.319 --> 02:51:38.507
front of it, hitting both of his pet basilisks.
Now seeing that there's, like, a full army between

02:51:38.507 --> 02:51:44.658
himself and the current intruders, one of which is
visibly stiffening, he glances over at this tiny

02:51:44.658 --> 02:51:50.586
gnome individual, who now gave loose to this bolt
of energy. Grabs his blade with both hands and

02:51:50.586 --> 02:51:55.484
goes running towards you with an angry-- but he
uses a bonus action, quickly, to pull out a vial,

02:51:55.484 --> 02:52:00.314
pop a cork, chug it, shatter the glass on the
ground. As he does, you can see his arms actually

02:52:00.314 --> 02:52:04.374
billow and grow extremely strong and thick with
muscle.

02:52:04.374 --> 02:52:06.169
MARISHA and LAURA: What color was the vial?

02:52:06.169 --> 02:52:08.331
MATT: This was purplish in color.

02:52:08.331 --> 02:52:18.780
He then runs forward. And is going to take
his turn, swinging at Scanlan.

02:52:18.780 --> 02:52:26.035
SAM: As he does, I sing (sings) Dodge that sexy
attack-oh white boy.

02:52:26.035 --> 02:52:28.329
(laughter)

02:52:28.329 --> 02:52:34.189
SAM: I sing my-- what is it called?
Counter-- Cutting Word-- no, yes, what? Cutting

02:52:34.189 --> 02:52:40.305
Words! And I try to distract him as he's attacking
me. What is that, a d8?

02:52:40.305 --> 02:52:41.929
MATT: A d8 off of his first attack.

02:52:41.929 --> 02:52:44.449
SAM: Five.

02:52:44.449 --> 02:52:48.947
MATT: Five. Okay, well, he rolled a 20, which
brings it down, oh, a total of 20, which brings it

02:52:48.947 --> 02:52:50.481
down to 15. What's your armor class?

02:52:50.481 --> 02:52:51.841
SAM: 14.

02:52:51.841 --> 02:53:00.586
MATT: Oh. Second strike is a 13. Third strike is a
12. Wow, he just can't hit at all this turn. But,

02:53:00.586 --> 02:53:05.753
however, the one strike he does get on you, the
sword comes down, streaks across the front of you,

02:53:05.753 --> 02:53:13.095
and as you're finishing your last, final note of
that song, you take 18 points of slashing damage.

02:53:13.095 --> 02:53:15.179
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

02:53:15.179 --> 02:53:16.809
ASHLEY: Where you at?

02:53:16.809 --> 02:53:17.801
SAM: I'm fine.

02:53:17.801 --> 02:53:18.755
ASHLEY: Where are you at?

02:53:18.755 --> 02:53:20.334
SAM: I'm fine. I've got more than him.

02:53:20.334 --> 02:53:24.152
MATT: That ends his turn. This brings us back to
Vex!

02:53:24.152 --> 02:53:30.257
LAURA: That's me! I cast Hunter's Mark! Actually,
I just transfer it, because the other one died.

02:53:30.257 --> 02:53:32.689
I transfer it to the king.

02:53:32.689 --> 02:53:39.430
And then I cast-- First I want to move
Trinket over and-- oh no, I can only move

02:53:39.430 --> 02:53:46.446
Trinket. Okay, first I'm gonna cast Conjure
Barrage. It's a 60-foot cone.

02:53:46.446 --> 02:53:49.449
So I want to see how many of them I can get.

02:53:49.449 --> 02:53:55.243
MATT: You can, you can get-- let's see. 
That'll get everybody.

02:53:55.243 --> 02:53:59.271
LAURA: Can I angle it so I don't hit my buddies?

02:53:59.271 --> 02:54:02.544
MATT: You can angle it in a way that will-- well,
if you wanna get the king in it, you're going to

02:54:02.544 --> 02:54:06.232
hit these two here. And Grog.

02:54:06.232 --> 02:54:07.977
LAURA: All right, I'll hit them.

02:54:07.977 --> 02:54:11.141
MATT: Okay, so, you will be able to hit everything
in that row. So go for it.

02:54:11.218 --> 02:54:12.947
How does the effect on that work?

02:54:13.367 --> 02:54:17.885
LAURA: I roll 3d8.

02:54:17.885 --> 02:54:19.773
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll 3d8.

02:54:19.773 --> 02:54:30.197
LAURA: That was on a corner. Oh good! 17.

02:54:30.197 --> 02:54:33.175
MATT: 17, okay. And what's the effect on the
spell, like what do they roll against?

02:54:33.175 --> 02:54:35.402
LAURA: They roll a dexterity saving throw.

02:54:35.402 --> 02:54:41.510
MATT: Dexterity saving throw. King makes his, with
a 20. So he takes half-damage for it,

02:54:41.510 --> 02:54:42.677
or no damage?

02:54:42.677 --> 02:54:45.041
LAURA: Half as much, yeah.

02:54:45.041 --> 02:54:51.116
MATT: Okay, so what was the total again? It was--
What was the total originally? It was-- what was

02:54:51.116 --> 02:54:51.849
the total?

02:54:51.849 --> 02:54:53.440
LAURA: The total? Was 17.

02:54:53.440 --> 02:54:56.655
MATT: 17. Okay, so that is eight damage to the
king.

02:54:56.655 --> 02:54:57.974
LAURA: Plus a Hunter's Mark.

02:54:57.974 --> 02:55:00.675
MATT: Right, so roll the additional one on that.

02:55:00.675 --> 02:55:02.493
LAURA: Four.

02:55:02.493 --> 02:55:09.193
MATT: Four, gotcha. All right. The basilisk also
does not make its save. What's the DC on this?

02:55:09.193 --> 02:55:12.235
LAURA: DC. What do you mean?

02:55:12.235 --> 02:55:13.773
MATT: Your spell DC. At the top of your spell
page.

02:55:13.773 --> 02:55:15.599
LAURA: Yes. It's 14.

02:55:15.599 --> 02:55:16.331
MATT: 14.

02:55:16.331 --> 02:55:18.012
LAURA: Oh, I did get a-- I didn't add my spell
attack bonus! Should I have done that?

02:55:18.012 --> 02:55:20.692
MATT: No, that's just to hit something with a
spell.

02:55:20.692 --> 02:55:21.958
LAURA: Okay, cool.

02:55:21.958 --> 02:55:30.165
MATT: All right, so basilisk in front makes it, so
it takes the eight damage. Okay, the rest of the

02:55:30.165 --> 02:55:41.758
duergar, they do make their saves, they take half
damage. However, with the spray of arrows that

02:55:41.758 --> 02:55:52.411
comes flying out of the front of your bow, you
manage to take out five duergar in one swipe. The

02:55:52.411 --> 02:55:57.910
others ones remain, damaged but still standing.
Also, now dexterity saving throw for you,

02:55:57.910 --> 02:56:02.408
Tiberius, and Grog.

02:56:02.408 --> 02:56:03.792
MARISHA: Natural 20.

02:56:03.792 --> 02:56:05.714
ORION: 19.

02:56:05.714 --> 02:56:08.916
MATT: Nice. So both you guys take eight damage.
Grog fails, Grog takes 17.

02:56:08.916 --> 02:56:10.766
LAURA: I'm sorry, Grog.

02:56:10.766 --> 02:56:15.788
MATT: "It's all right." All right, Vex, is that
the end of your turn?

02:56:15.788 --> 02:56:24.294
LAURA: Oh, I move Trinket in, and I want to-- If I
can get him to illithid, I want to get Trinket

02:56:24.294 --> 02:56:31.046
close, like kind of behind the queen. No, no, I
want to get him near. That way he can flank.

02:56:31.046 --> 02:56:38.355
MATT: Okay, all right. That ends your turn. 
It is now Lady Kima's turn.

02:56:38.355 --> 02:56:39.998
SAM: Ooh, I forgot about her.

02:56:39.998 --> 02:56:45.748
MATT: Kima rushes in angrily. She has to make a
saving throw. Succeeds against the basilisk, as it

02:56:45.748 --> 02:56:54.020
glances past. Rushes forward, in combat with both
King Murghol and the basilisk. However, as she

02:56:54.020 --> 02:56:58.541
goes in for King Murghol, screaming, the blade of
the greatsword arcing across the air with a divine

02:56:58.541 --> 02:57:05.222
glowing energy, you see it aiming for the king,
but then looks to her side and sees this dangerous

02:57:05.222 --> 02:57:09.198
lizard creature, recognizing it in a moment, she
changes her trajectory and swings next to the

02:57:09.198 --> 02:57:21.355
lizard with her first strike. That is a-- that
hits. And that strike does just enough damage. She

02:57:21.355 --> 02:57:27.225
cleaves that basilisk in two with her first
strike. With her first strike, using the inertia,

02:57:27.225 --> 02:57:30.515
she turns around and strikes at King Murghol.

02:57:31.190 --> 02:57:35.658
However, King Murghol, seeing her come
forward, takes his sword up and manages to parry

02:57:35.658 --> 02:57:39.587
hers to the side. Both of them lock for a second
as he steps into her and kind of glares into her

02:57:39.587 --> 02:57:44.967
face. "Oh, you're supposed to be downstairs for
playtime." Pushes her off with his blade..

02:57:44.967 --> 02:57:52.565
MARISHA: Playtime? I don't-- (laughs) I know, all
the ladies are like 'ew'.

02:57:52.565 --> 02:57:59.575
MATT: That brings us to Queen Ulara's turn. Queen
Ulara is now standing over there with Trinket

02:57:59.575 --> 02:58:05.741
towards her back. As she instinctually does this,
she goes ahead and reaches up, places her hand on

02:58:05.741 --> 02:58:09.643
the front of her robes. You can see this duergar
woman with kind of long, reddish hair that she's

02:58:09.643 --> 02:58:14.026
let flow to the back, to the small of her back.
She stands up out of the throne. As she puts her

02:58:14.026 --> 02:58:20.290
hand on her chest, her form shimmers, much like
you saw earlier on Tiberius, in your earlier

02:58:20.290 --> 02:58:26.577
battle. She moves back to there.

02:58:26.577 --> 02:58:30.200
ORION: As she does that, I try to Counterspell
it.

02:58:30.200 --> 02:58:32.002
MATT: That's a reaction?

02:58:32.002 --> 02:58:33.004
ORION: Yep.

02:58:33.004 --> 02:58:35.900
MATT: Okay. So let's go ahead and do the contested
roll.

02:58:35.900 --> 02:58:37.901
ORION: Contested roll.

02:58:37.901 --> 02:58:45.231
SAM: That was almost the name of this show. Not as
catchy.

02:58:45.231 --> 02:58:49.566
ORION: DC equals ten plus the spell's level.

02:58:49.566 --> 02:58:55.758
MATT: Okay. So the DC is 12. Go ahead and you roll
that.

02:58:55.758 --> 02:59:01.520
ORION: DC is 13. It's a third-level spell. Right?

02:59:01.520 --> 02:59:03.078
MATT: Blur is second-level.

02:59:03.078 --> 02:59:06.128
ORION: Oh, I thought Counter-- Okay, I see.

02:59:06.128 --> 02:59:16.022
MATT: Yes. So, Counterspell. Go ahead and-- Oh--
interrupt a creature in process of casting a

02:59:16.022 --> 02:59:22.198
spell. If the creature is casting a spell-- third
level or lower, it fails and has no effect. So,

02:59:22.198 --> 02:59:31.924
yeah, it just counters it entirely. So, the-- her
form begins to shimmer for a second. All of a

02:59:31.924 --> 02:59:39.091
sudden, Tiberius, your attempt to go ahead and
counter the spell, that burst of energy you're

02:59:39.091 --> 02:59:41.734
trying to put through the Blur vanishes. She looks
back at you.

02:59:41.734 --> 02:59:44.354
ORION: What do you think you're doing, lass?

02:59:44.354 --> 02:59:46.868
SAM: You still trying to be a god?

02:59:46.868 --> 02:59:48.862
ORION: I'm in that form still.

02:59:48.862 --> 02:59:50.114
(laughter)

02:59:50.114 --> 02:59:54.581
MATT: Yeah. So with her sorcery points expended on
that quick cast, she turns around for her main

02:59:54.581 --> 03:00:00.550
action, puts out her fingers, and you see these
blasts of blue energy begin to rocket out from her

03:00:00.550 --> 03:00:05.017
fingertips, across the room, in what is a Chain
Lightning.

03:00:05.017 --> 03:00:08.569
LIAM: Shit. He's got the iPhone out.

03:00:08.569 --> 03:00:19.650
MATT: So, this'll be towards-- actually, this'd be
towards you, Vex, Kima, and Scanlan.

03:00:19.650 --> 03:00:21.047
LAURA: All right.

03:00:21.047 --> 03:00:22.345
LIAM: Did you say Vex or Vax?

03:00:22.345 --> 03:00:26.212
MATT: Yeah, Vex and Vax, both of you.

03:00:26.212 --> 03:00:28.525
LAURA: Wait, you're all the way over there.

03:00:28.525 --> 03:00:30.734
SAM: Yeah, you're all the way over somewhere else,
right?

03:00:30.734 --> 03:00:41.325
MATT: Over there, yeah. Chain Lightning, man. It's
a bitch. All right. All right, so. Vax, go ahead

03:00:41.325 --> 03:00:43.485
and make a dexterity saving throw.

03:00:43.485 --> 03:00:49.774
LIAM: Not good. Seven.

03:00:49.774 --> 03:00:52.032
MATT: Seven, all right.

03:00:52.032 --> 03:00:56.560
LIAM: Can I use Evasion, or-- Uncanny Dodge or
Evasion?

03:00:56.560 --> 03:00:56.810
SAM: I gave you some dice. I gave you, I gave you
some dice.

03:00:56.810 --> 03:00:58.227
LIAM: You did give me some dice.

03:00:58.227 --> 03:01:00.006
SAM: It's not going to be enough, though.

03:01:00.006 --> 03:01:04.257
LIAM: So now I'm at 13, but can I use Evasion or
Uncanny Dodge? Evasion is for area effects,

03:01:04.257 --> 03:01:05.231
Uncanny Dodge is--

03:01:05.231 --> 03:01:09.466
MATT: Well, you've already used one for the area
effect, the other one reduces the damage by half.

03:01:09.466 --> 03:01:10.193
LIAM: All right, Uncanny Dodge.

03:01:10.193 --> 03:01:11.769
MATT: Okay, so you're reducing the damage by
half?

03:01:11.769 --> 03:01:12.590
LIAM: Yeah.

03:01:12.590 --> 03:01:19.579
MATT: Okay, so instead, you take 18 points of
lightning damage. However, both Vex and Scanlan

03:01:19.579 --> 03:01:26.243
and Kima all have to make dexterity saving throws
as well. She makes hers.

03:01:26.243 --> 03:01:33.091
SAM: Not great. 14. I have no dexterity.

03:01:33.091 --> 03:01:34.515
LAURA: 16.

03:01:34.515 --> 03:01:40.576
MATT: 16, okay. So you took, was it 18 lightning
damage, I said?

03:01:40.576 --> 03:01:44.294
LIAM: Oh, I didn't add any dexterity. I add a 9 to
what I got, which means I'm at 22.

03:01:44.294 --> 03:01:50.556
MATT: Just, you mean, your dexterity modifier? 22?
Okay, then you would've taken half damage, make it

03:01:50.556 --> 03:01:55.384
quarter damage, so you take half of that even. So
keep that in mind when you make your dexterity

03:01:55.384 --> 03:02:01.868
saving throw. So, that would give you total how
much damage? So, it was 18 you took, right?

03:02:01.868 --> 03:02:06.485
LIAM: Yeah, and we halved it to nine. Five?

03:02:06.485 --> 03:02:15.842
MATT: So, 36 damage to Scanlan and to Kima, and to
you, Vex. 36 points of lightning damage. That ends

03:02:15.842 --> 03:02:24.994
her turn. Tiberius, you're up. So you, it's your
turn now, as you're now

03:02:24.994 --> 03:02:26.364
on top of the scorpion still.

03:02:26.364 --> 03:02:27.280
ASHLEY: It's okay.

03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:31.962
MARISHA: You're on top of me. I'm holding you!

03:02:31.962 --> 03:02:35.612
ASHLEY: I got you.

03:02:35.612 --> 03:02:40.915
ORION: Cool. This is-- there's still on the altar
that's raised above-- and all that.

03:02:40.915 --> 03:02:44.306
TALIESIN: You've got a problem down there, to be
fair.

03:02:44.306 --> 03:02:46.447
ORION: Where we're at?

03:02:46.447 --> 03:02:48.942
TALIESIN: You've got the witch problem to deal
with.

03:02:48.942 --> 03:02:50.938
MATT: What do you got, Tiberius? Quick, before you
miss your turn.

03:02:50.938 --> 03:02:55.888
ORION: I shall miss nothing. I'm going to stay
right where I'm at.

03:02:55.888 --> 03:02:56.860
MATT: All right.

03:02:56.860 --> 03:03:13.077
ORION: I'm going to snicker, and I will (laughs)
hand out, put out my hand, and give my little ring

03:03:13.077 --> 03:03:14.649
a rub, and let out a Fireball from it, right where
no one else but these buttholes will get hurt.

03:03:14.649 --> 03:03:18.605
MATT: All right, so (laughs), I'd say probably a
20-foot radius around would put it about there.

03:03:18.605 --> 03:03:20.943
LIAM: (Tiberius voice) What is the Common word for
it?

03:03:21.140 --> 03:03:22.784
ALL: (Tiberius voice) Butthole.

03:03:22.784 --> 03:03:26.731
MATT: So, as you polish off the ring and release
it, the bead of red energy streaks across,

03:03:26.731 --> 03:03:32.286
blasting the floor, the secondary explosion, giant
Fireball just bursts into the room, go ahead and

03:03:32.286 --> 03:03:34.101
roll damage on that.

03:03:34.101 --> 03:03:53.081
ORION: Six, I have enough, there's a four, this is
terrible, help me count, eight.

03:03:53.081 --> 03:03:59.043
MARISHA: Okay, well, we have all these twos. Let's
put the twos side by side. That's fun. Uh-huh.

03:03:59.043 --> 03:04:01.500
LAURA: Your turns are taking so long!

03:04:01.500 --> 03:04:03.386
ORION: 18. 23!

03:04:03.386 --> 03:04:13.114
MATT: 23. Okay. The rest of these duergar
detonate, blasted away out of play. Just, their

03:04:13.114 --> 03:04:16.358
bodies go thrown against the walls and the various
pillars in the room. There's two pillars over

03:04:16.358 --> 03:04:21.957
there, they're kind of holding the ceiling up. The
rest of them just go thrown about the room. The

03:04:21.957 --> 03:04:26.255
queen takes a bit of the damage, but seems to
shrug off most of it.

03:04:26.255 --> 03:04:33.391
ORION: I'm going to spend two sorcerer points. And
I'm going to reach out my hand, and I'm going to

03:04:33.391 --> 03:04:40.448
form an ice knife and-- where is the queen,
actually?

03:04:40.448 --> 03:04:41.767
MATT: Right there.

03:04:41.767 --> 03:04:48.810
ORION: Oh, very good. I'm going to throw the ice
knife right there.

03:04:48.810 --> 03:04:53.665
MATT: Okay. Right there? All right.

03:04:53.665 --> 03:04:56.264
ORION: And I cast it at level two.

03:04:56.264 --> 03:05:00.919
MATT: All right. So you get to throw at a target,
though, right? Or are you just throwing

03:05:00.919 --> 03:05:04.603
on the ground to do the radial? Okay, so you
take-- you form the ice knife, you throw it, it

03:05:04.603 --> 03:05:08.804
streaks across, slams into the stone floor and
explodes, sending shards of ice out. Go ahead and

03:05:08.804 --> 03:05:09.873
roll damage.

03:05:09.873 --> 03:05:12.059
ORION: Which is 3d6, because it's at level two
now.

03:05:12.059 --> 03:05:15.307
MATT: Correct. Saving throw, which it succeeds.

03:05:15.307 --> 03:05:20.191
ORION: Much better. 14 points of damage.

03:05:20.191 --> 03:05:26.766
MATT: Okay. Both succeed for half damage. So seven
points of damage to each. All right, got it, cool.

03:05:26.766 --> 03:05:29.251
That ends your turn, Tiberius. Clarota, now--

03:05:29.251 --> 03:05:32.626
ORION: How do you like them apples?!

03:05:32.626 --> 03:05:40.361
MATT: Clarota steps forward-- Seeing the other
mind flayer there, steps past and decides to go

03:05:40.361 --> 03:05:42.806
into a contest of wills against it.

03:05:42.806 --> 03:05:46.331
MARISHA: Contest of wills, staring contest,
staring contest!

03:05:46.331 --> 03:05:54.347
MATT: All right, this is intense. All right.
Clarota is going to step forward and begin to

03:05:54.535 --> 03:05:59.495
intensely stare at-- you can see the air itself
seems to shimmer and push, like a strange bubble

03:05:59.495 --> 03:06:03.815
shifting between the two of them at this
connection point. Mind flayer, now one-eyed and

03:06:03.815 --> 03:06:10.246
seeping liquid from the side of its face, glares
back at him. Fails his saving throw.

03:06:10.246 --> 03:06:11.893
MARISHA: That's right, he does.

03:06:11.893 --> 03:06:18.254
MATT: This mind flayer suddenly diverts its
attention away from Clarota and towards the queen.

03:06:18.254 --> 03:06:21.603
(cheering)

03:06:21.603 --> 03:06:23.955
SAM: The old Dominate.

03:06:23.955 --> 03:06:26.000
ASHLEY: Tight, tight, tight.

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:27.443
(laughter)

03:06:27.443 --> 03:06:34.081
MATT: That ends Clarota's turn. All right. The
duergar would go if they weren't all blasted to

03:06:34.081 --> 03:06:38.088
hell. That brings us to Keyleth.

03:06:38.088 --> 03:06:46.601
MARISHA: All right. I'm going to go right for the
king. You're coming for a ride, Tiberius. I'm

03:06:46.601 --> 03:06:49.768
gonna make a straight line. I have a 40-foot
movement, pretty straight movement.

03:06:49.768 --> 03:06:51.650
ORION: All right! Let's get 'em!

03:06:51.650 --> 03:06:53.712
LAURA: Oh no, Tiberius fell off.

03:06:53.712 --> 03:06:57.211
MATT: There you go.

03:06:57.211 --> 03:07:01.880
MARISHA: Okay, I'm in melee, yeah?

03:07:01.880 --> 03:07:02.877
MATT: Yes, you are.

03:07:02.877 --> 03:07:05.272
MARISHA: All right, I'm gonna do my full three
multi-attack.

03:07:05.272 --> 03:07:08.022
ORION: I'm maniacally laughing.

03:07:08.022 --> 03:07:13.111
MATT: You are going to have a disadvantage on the
tail attack, because you have Tiberius on your

03:07:13.111 --> 03:07:15.488
back and you're trying to make sure you don't hit
him with your tail.

03:07:15.488 --> 03:07:16.348
MARISHA: Okay.

03:07:16.348 --> 03:07:17.995
MATT: So, first two claw strikes.

03:07:17.995 --> 03:07:21.943
MARISHA: Okay, first one, probably not gonna hit.
12?

03:07:21.943 --> 03:07:24.677
MATT: No, that does not hit.

03:07:24.677 --> 03:07:27.324
MARISHA: Second one. 16?

03:07:27.324 --> 03:07:33.188
MATT: Does not hit. Clink, clink! Off the armor.
Tail strike.

03:07:33.188 --> 03:07:37.029
MARISHA: Tail strike. Two. Ten. Nothing.

03:07:37.029 --> 03:07:41.118
MATT: Yeah, unfortunately just his thick suit of
armor-- you're just hitting at him with the giant

03:07:41.118 --> 03:07:43.620
scorpion claws, but nothing seems to be getting
through.

03:07:43.620 --> 03:07:47.097
MARISHA: God, you're so heavy, Tiberius, god!

03:07:47.097 --> 03:07:49.937
MATT: You hear this clacking scorpion angrily
(scorpion sounds).

03:07:49.937 --> 03:07:52.687
MARISHA: My balance is wonky.

03:07:52.687 --> 03:07:53.930
MATT: Pike, you're up!

03:07:53.930 --> 03:08:00.034
ASHLEY: All right, time for some healing. So pull
me in there. I'm gonna do a-- I'm gonna do a Mass

03:08:00.034 --> 03:08:11.539
Cure Wounds. At level five gives, which I thinks
gives-- thinks? Which methinks gives me 4d8? Plus

03:08:11.539 --> 03:08:14.796
my spell ability modifier. Okay, so--

03:08:14.796 --> 03:08:17.739
MARISHA: Get your heal on.

03:08:17.739 --> 03:08:20.459
LIAM: (Yoda voice) 4d8 you would give.

03:08:20.459 --> 03:08:30.023
ASHLEY: Oh, so, 20. 20 points of healing for
whoever would like it.

03:08:30.023 --> 03:08:34.782
MATT: For everyone who's in the radius. Everyone
but Grog, essentially, gets healed for 20 points.

03:08:34.782 --> 03:08:37.936
Grog's too far away from you, unfortunately.

03:08:37.936 --> 03:08:40.723
SAM: Thank you, my love.

03:08:40.723 --> 03:08:43.321
MATT: All right, Percy, you're up.

03:08:43.321 --> 03:08:51.548
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to just get-- just
step into the doorway to take a look. I'm just

03:08:51.548 --> 03:08:58.081
stepping one step. And now I'm just going to
shoot-- can I-- I'm just gonna try and-- The

03:08:58.081 --> 03:09:03.316
minute I recognize what a basilisk is, since I've
faced them before, I'm going to do my best not to

03:09:03.316 --> 03:09:04.852
look and take a shot.

03:09:04.852 --> 03:09:09.251
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and fire with a
disadvantage against the basilisk on the far end

03:09:09.251 --> 03:09:10.498
of the room.

03:09:10.498 --> 03:09:11.893
SAM: Don't you shoot me.

03:09:11.893 --> 03:09:13.992
MARISHA: Oh, that was a pretty one.

03:09:13.992 --> 03:09:17.211
TALIESIN: I get 16 at my disadvantage.

03:09:17.211 --> 03:09:19.779
MATT: 16 at disadvantage? That does hit. Go ahead
and roll damage.

03:09:19.779 --> 03:09:22.292
TALIESIN: Nice! I'll be taking another shot, too.

03:09:22.292 --> 03:09:25.137
MATT: Also, Tiberius, make another constitution
saving throw.

03:09:25.137 --> 03:09:26.716
TALIESIN: Six points of damage.

03:09:26.716 --> 03:09:30.353
MATT: Six points of damage to the basilisk, got
it.

03:09:30.353 --> 03:09:36.719
TALIESIN: I'm going to take another shot, though.
16 again.

03:09:36.719 --> 03:09:39.833
ORION: Ten.

03:09:39.833 --> 03:09:45.756
TALIESIN: 16 hits. This time I do 12 points of
damage.

03:09:45.756 --> 03:09:48.819
MARISHA: 12 points?

03:09:48.819 --> 03:09:56.180
TALIESIN: 12 points. And then I'm gonna duck back
around the corner again.

03:09:56.180 --> 03:10:01.018
MATT: Okay. Cool. As you duck around the corner,
you've gotten these strikes in, and as you're

03:10:01.018 --> 03:10:09.257
trying to-- as you finish your blows on the
duergar king, Murghol, in front of you, you hear

03:10:09.257 --> 03:10:15.493
this clanking sound as Tiberius's now fully stone
form falls off of the scorpion onto the ground,

03:10:15.493 --> 03:10:16.969
beside you.

03:10:16.969 --> 03:10:18.955
SAM: Oh no! He's stoned!

03:10:18.955 --> 03:10:22.906
ASHLEY: You turned to stone?

03:10:22.906 --> 03:10:24.553
LAURA: 'Cause of the basilisk.

03:10:24.553 --> 03:10:25.931
LIAM: We've dealt with this before.

03:10:25.931 --> 03:10:27.940
LAURA: Basilisk blood, we can fix it.

03:10:27.940 --> 03:10:31.046
SAM: I think you pee on the body and it cures
them.

03:10:31.046 --> 03:10:33.597
ASHLEY: Can I-- I can't, I have to go--

03:10:33.597 --> 03:10:37.755
SAM: Let's try it and find out.

03:10:37.755 --> 03:10:41.862
MATT: The basilisk now takes its turn.

03:10:41.862 --> 03:10:44.423
LIAM: (stone Tiberius voice) Please, no!

03:10:44.423 --> 03:10:51.874
MATT: Steps forward onto the edge. It's going to
go ahead and-- it's gonna be for Lady Kima. It's

03:10:51.874 --> 03:10:55.074
going to attempt to make its stare at her. Lady
Kima--

03:10:55.074 --> 03:10:56.591
ASHLEY: Close your eyes!

03:10:56.591 --> 03:10:59.160
LAURA: She's smart, she's closing her eyes.

03:10:59.160 --> 03:11:03.524
MATT: Lady Kima, who's currently in this blood
frenzy against the king, unfortunately is not

03:11:03.524 --> 03:11:06.530
paying attention. Off to the side, the basilisk
gets a glance out, which she looks at from the

03:11:06.530 --> 03:11:10.585
corner of her eye, she sees the movement over and
has a hard time pushing through the stiffness as

03:11:10.585 --> 03:11:13.622
the gaze begins to take a clenching effect on her
body.

03:11:13.622 --> 03:11:14.720
LAURA: Oh no.

03:11:14.720 --> 03:11:22.043
COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: All set, let's go.

03:11:22.043 --> 03:11:29.195
MATT: Yes, thank you. Let's do that. Oh, Waze.
Why's my phone on? All right, so, that brings us

03:11:29.195 --> 03:11:33.530
to the-- Oof, okay.

03:11:33.530 --> 03:11:36.657
LIAM: (computer voice) I'm sorry, I can't help you
with that, Vex'ahlia.

03:11:36.657 --> 03:11:45.002
MATT: This mind flayer, who's currently Dominated,
steps forward and is going to attempt to make a

03:11:45.002 --> 03:11:51.982
tentacle grab against the queen. Queen Ulara
manages to dodge out of the way, seeing this

03:11:51.982 --> 03:11:56.571
coming, and just backhands it, while taking a step
back. Unfortunately does not cling with the

03:11:56.571 --> 03:12:05.596
tentacle. That ends its action. Yeah,
unfortunately that didn't hit. All right, next, at

03:12:05.596 --> 03:12:07.290
the top, that brings us to Vax.

03:12:07.290 --> 03:12:13.374
LIAM: I'm hasted. I'm gonna try to go stealth
again from where I am. So I'm stealth, 17-- 30.

03:12:13.575 --> 03:12:19.750
Okay. I'm going to scuttle along the floor and
leap on the back of the basilisk and try to stab

03:12:19.750 --> 03:12:22.466
it in the eye while looking at the ceiling.

03:12:22.466 --> 03:12:27.348
MATT: Well, at the start of your turn, it's within
30 feet of you and you can see it.

03:12:27.348 --> 03:12:29.153
Are you going to--

03:12:29.153 --> 03:12:30.784
LIAM: Not look at it, no, no.

03:12:30.784 --> 03:12:37.312
MATT: Okay, so you're taking disadvantage on this
attack. So you move behind, you're hidden.

03:12:37.312 --> 03:12:40.743
LIAM: 15 for my first attack.

03:12:40.743 --> 03:12:44.423
MATT: Your first attack, that will not hit,
unfortunately.

03:12:44.423 --> 03:12:49.995
LIAM: And second time, 19 for the second attack.

03:12:49.995 --> 03:12:51.337
MATT: That does hit, yes.

03:12:51.337 --> 03:12:59.116
LIAM: Okay. Feel for the eyes, stab it with keen
dagger-- Four. 11.

03:12:59.116 --> 03:13:07.718
MATT: Okay. As you rush over, you take your first
strike at the basilisk, you see it reel back and

03:13:07.718 --> 03:13:11.261
slap around its tail. You barely just get out of
the way, and as you see its head turning around to

03:13:11.261 --> 03:13:15.786
attempt to glare at you, you instinctively take
your offhand dagger and place it directly into the

03:13:15.786 --> 03:13:20.389
eye socket of the basilisk. It sinks past your
fingers and you feel that warm rush of blood and

03:13:20.389 --> 03:13:24.622
gore against your hand. As you pull back, it just
slumps to the ground.

03:13:24.622 --> 03:13:27.138
(cheering)

03:13:27.138 --> 03:13:35.596
ASHLEY: We'll get you some of that-- we'll get you
some of that blood. Blood! Basilisk blood!

03:13:35.596 --> 03:13:44.300
LIAM: I only moved ten feet. So who's stone right
now? Tiberius and-- wasn't-- aren't two people?

03:13:44.300 --> 03:13:48.401
MATT: Lady Kima is mid-effect and Tiberius is
solid stone.

03:13:48.401 --> 03:13:55.310
LIAM: I've got Haste on-- If I've got Haste on,
can I get to Kima? 'Cause I've got haste boots.

03:13:55.310 --> 03:13:57.610
MATT: I would say, yeah, you could spend the rest
of your movement doing that, yeah.

03:13:57.610 --> 03:14:02.591
LIAM: Okay, and I use my thumb to slide some of
its blood off the blade

03:14:02.591 --> 03:14:04.270
and drip it onto her eyes.

03:14:04.270 --> 03:14:11.410
MATT: Okay. All right. That ends your turn. That
brings us to Grog. Grog turns and is going to go

03:14:11.410 --> 03:14:24.800
ahead and go raging, frenzied, against the queen.
And a critical hit.

03:14:24.800 --> 03:14:26.644
(cheering)

03:14:26.644 --> 03:14:29.272
MARISHA: He crit?

03:14:29.272 --> 03:14:30.548
ORION: Yeah.

03:14:30.548 --> 03:14:34.730
MATT: The first hit, she's gonna go ahead and use
her reaction to do Shield, it's going to up her

03:14:34.730 --> 03:14:40.021
defense. First attack misses, so two attacks miss
now and the last attack is a critical hit, which

03:14:40.021 --> 03:14:42.020
is nice. So that's a--

03:14:42.020 --> 03:14:45.386
MARISHA: No crits for you! Crit happens, whether
you're here or not.

03:14:45.386 --> 03:14:52.469
MATT: All right, so that's 31 points of damage.
Oof, that's a hefty chunk. All right, that ends

03:14:52.469 --> 03:14:54.945
Grog's turn. That brings us to Scanlan!

03:14:54.945 --> 03:14:59.211
SAM: I'm next to the king, right? I'm near the
king? Over there.

03:14:59.211 --> 03:15:00.840
MATT: Yep. You're right next to him.

03:15:00.840 --> 03:15:08.805
SAM: Okay. I just make eye contact with him and I
mentally tell him that he really has the urge to

03:15:08.945 --> 03:15:16.915
try to do a headstand. Lay down his weapon and he
really just wants to see if he can do it.

03:15:16.915 --> 03:15:18.612
(laughter)

03:15:18.612 --> 03:15:20.387
MATT: Okay.

03:15:20.387 --> 03:15:21.570
SAM: Suggestion.

03:15:21.570 --> 03:15:24.381
MATT: Okay. (laughs) What's your DC?

03:15:24.381 --> 03:15:25.451
SAM: 19.

03:15:25.451 --> 03:15:27.016
MATT: All right. This is through the hand cone?

03:15:27.016 --> 03:15:29.097
SAM: Through the hand cone, through the hand
cone.

03:15:29.097 --> 03:15:37.494
MATT: Okay. That will be a 20, unfortunately.
Makes his saving throw. He glances back towards

03:15:37.494 --> 03:15:42.258
you with a look of confusion for a second. Looks
at his feet and like begins to reach forward and

03:15:42.258 --> 03:15:46.827
then steels his mind and looks up at you angrily.
All right.

03:15:46.827 --> 03:15:51.568
SAM: Can I also, as my bonus action-- Who's around
me? Who needs inspiration? Who needs inspiring?

03:15:51.568 --> 03:15:59.121
Who's-- yeah, oh, shit. I'll give Pike some
inspiration, 'cause she's my awesome sweetheart.

03:15:59.121 --> 03:16:00.377
ASHLEY: What do I get?

03:16:00.377 --> 03:16:01.492
LAURA: You get 1d8.

03:16:01.492 --> 03:16:02.980
ASHLEY: Hey, thanks, man.

03:16:02.980 --> 03:16:07.213
MATT: Next up is King Murghol, who's furious now.
Both of his beasts have been slain and most of his

03:16:07.213 --> 03:16:14.648
men have been completely torn asunder by
multitudes of arrows and fireball spells. He, now

03:16:14.648 --> 03:16:20.313
growing in physical form, on top of already the
musculature he acquired from that potion, is going

03:16:20.313 --> 03:16:27.251
to make his three attacks against whatever is
nearby. That's actually going to be-- actually,

03:16:27.251 --> 03:16:30.290
that's gonna be two strikes against you, Scanlan,
since you just now tried to make him stand on his

03:16:30.290 --> 03:16:32.260
head, and one against Kima.

03:16:32.260 --> 03:16:33.699
(laughter)

03:16:33.699 --> 03:16:35.602
MATT: That is a 15--

03:16:35.602 --> 03:16:37.190
SAM: Hit.

03:16:37.190 --> 03:16:38.719
MATT: -- a 24--

03:16:38.719 --> 03:16:40.485
SAM: (higher voice) Hit.

03:16:40.485 --> 03:16:42.728
MATT: -- and against Kima is a 20, that also hits.
So all three hit.

03:16:42.728 --> 03:16:44.591
LIAM: Nobody puts baby in the corner.

03:16:44.591 --> 03:16:46.057
(laughter)

03:16:46.057 --> 03:16:58.210
MATT: Oof, all right. So the first strike hits you
for 21 points of slashing damage.

03:16:58.210 --> 03:16:59.616
SAM: Still alive.

03:16:59.616 --> 03:17:02.553
MATT: The next one hits you for 23 points of
slashing damage.

03:17:02.553 --> 03:17:04.559
SAM: No longer alive (laughs).

03:17:04.559 --> 03:17:06.230
ASHLEY: You're no longer alive?

03:17:06.230 --> 03:17:07.994
LAURA: Are you unconscious?!

03:17:07.994 --> 03:17:12.072
MATT: Scanlan falls unconscious on the ground from
the two strikes of the king. The third strike back

03:17:12.072 --> 03:17:16.848
towards Kima, who's currently seizing from the
effect of the spell. She's restrained, so he has

03:17:16.848 --> 03:17:17.786
advantage.

03:17:17.786 --> 03:17:20.011
LIAM: But she's got the basilisk blood in her
eyes.

03:17:20.011 --> 03:17:31.470
MATT: There's a process to undoing a creature into
stone. To your knowledge, it does not seem to be

03:17:31.470 --> 03:17:41.156
having an effect. However, Lady Kima takes 22
points of damage. All righty. That brings us to--

03:17:41.156 --> 03:17:44.470
Vex, you're up.

03:17:44.470 --> 03:17:47.662
LAURA: Oh, that's me. Every time!

03:17:47.662 --> 03:17:49.062
LIAM: I'm Vex.

03:17:49.062 --> 03:18:01.803
LAURA: No, you're not. Okay, I'm gonna hail, I'm
gonna-- hail of arr-- no, yeah, Hail of Thorns? At

03:18:01.803 --> 03:18:04.247
level three.

03:18:04.247 --> 03:18:05.715
MATT: Okay, at who?

03:18:05.715 --> 03:18:17.488
LAURA: At the queen and the illithid. So, I
should've transferred my bonus action over to--

03:18:17.488 --> 03:18:23.802
but I didn't, that's okay. That gives me-- I
should've done this before,

03:18:23.802 --> 03:18:25.402
I'm an asshole, I'm sorry.

03:18:25.402 --> 03:18:27.305
LIAM: But what about in the game?

03:18:27.305 --> 03:18:34.106
LAURA: That gives me 2d10.

03:18:34.106 --> 03:18:36.283
MATT: Additional damage to the arrow.

03:18:36.283 --> 03:18:37.726
LAURA: Yes.

03:18:37.726 --> 03:18:42.395
MATT: So it explodes around, right? All right, so,
fire the arrow. So, as your bonus action, you go

03:18:42.395 --> 03:18:45.337
and you grab one of the arrows out from the back,
and as you pull it back you can see a bunch of

03:18:45.337 --> 03:18:50.471
these little thorns begin to grow and sprout from
the actual shaft of the arrow. You release it and

03:18:50.471 --> 03:18:51.907
as it arcs across--

03:18:51.907 --> 03:18:53.324
LAURA: Yes! Natural 20!

03:18:53.324 --> 03:18:55.216
(cheering)

03:18:55.216 --> 03:19:02.007
MATT: Against the queen. All right, go ahead and
roll the damage for the arrow and the damage for

03:19:02.007 --> 03:19:04.363
the spell. And all that doubles.

03:19:04.363 --> 03:19:05.942
LAURA: Oh, awesome.

03:19:05.942 --> 03:19:10.043
MARISHA: (sings) All that doubles is gold.

03:19:10.043 --> 03:19:13.499
TALIESIN: (sings) Only shooting arrows.

03:19:13.499 --> 03:19:17.271
ORION: (sings) In a butthole.

03:19:17.271 --> 03:19:19.811
LAURA: Yeah, all of it doubles.

03:19:19.811 --> 03:19:22.593
MATT: The bonus at the end doesn't double, just
the dice.

03:19:22.593 --> 03:19:24.373
LAURA: Oh, so, 36--

03:19:24.373 --> 03:19:32.681
MATT: 36 points of damage. Yeah, plus the seven.
And then it does-- it explodes? In a radius. And

03:19:32.681 --> 03:19:35.386
it does the dice damage, the 2d10, to--

03:19:35.386 --> 03:19:38.734
LAURA: To everything within five feet.

03:19:38.734 --> 03:19:40.743
MATT: All right, so the mind flayer and Grog.

03:19:40.743 --> 03:19:45.324
LAURA: Oh, right, yeah, I should've hit the mind
flayer with that arrow. No, it would've still hit

03:19:45.324 --> 03:19:46.687
Grog. Okay.

03:19:46.687 --> 03:19:48.726
LIAM: Grog is a tank.

03:19:48.726 --> 03:19:50.800
LAURA: They have to make a dexterity saving
throw.

03:19:50.800 --> 03:19:54.869
MATT: All righty. Grog does not make it and the
mind flayer does not make it.

03:19:54.869 --> 03:19:56.230
LAURA: Yes!

03:19:56.230 --> 03:20:00.064
MATT: All right, cool. All right, second arrow you
can fire now if you want to.

03:20:00.064 --> 03:20:04.718
LAURA: Second arrow. I'm gonna fire from my
flaming bow. I've got one shot on that left. At

03:20:04.718 --> 03:20:06.282
her again.

03:20:06.282 --> 03:20:07.789
MATT: All right.

03:20:07.789 --> 03:20:09.555
LAURA: And that's a 28.

03:20:09.555 --> 03:20:10.661
MATT: That hits.

03:20:10.661 --> 03:20:22.518
LAURA: And that's nine plus a ten, where's my ten?
There they are. That's plus two. 11.

03:20:22.518 --> 03:20:28.684
MATT: All right. You see flames begin to burn up
along the side of her robe and she's looking

03:20:28.684 --> 03:20:36.836
really flustered and frustrated at this point. All
right, that brings us to Kima's turn. No. She's

03:20:36.836 --> 03:20:42.480
made of hardy stuff. Kima currently is fighting
this, is going to go ahead and release an entire--

03:20:42.480 --> 03:20:45.668
all of her attacks against the king Murghol as
he's right in front of her. She has disadvantage

03:20:45.668 --> 03:20:49.370
on that, unfortunately, because she is restrained.
She's gonna make two attacks against him using

03:20:49.370 --> 03:20:56.432
Divine Smite, expending a 3rd-level spell. So
that's 3d8 extra damage to each strike. So the

03:20:56.432 --> 03:21:03.146
first one hits. Both hit. All right. She's going
to do it twice.

03:21:03.146 --> 03:21:05.930
That's gonna be 6d8 additional damage.

03:21:05.930 --> 03:21:08.424
MARISHA: Ooh! That's hot.

03:21:08.424 --> 03:21:22.047
MATT: Oof. Okay. So, as Kima rears back, her first
strike comes down and hits overhead, into King

03:21:22.047 --> 03:21:26.229
Murghol's armor, and as it does, it hits. The
blade only goes about a few inches in, but then

03:21:26.229 --> 03:21:30.191
all of a sudden the blade heats up white-hot and
actually buries itself an additional six inches

03:21:30.191 --> 03:21:34.746
into his shoulder. He screams out in pain, reaches
up and grabs the blade and as he does, his hand

03:21:34.746 --> 03:21:40.663
actually burns in the process. She pulls the blade
out, around and swings it down again, sinking

03:21:40.663 --> 03:21:44.260
another eight inches into the side of his torso.
This time with a giant arc of white divine light

03:21:44.260 --> 03:21:48.992
into the side. He looks like he's starting to
bleed out from the two of the wounds really

03:21:48.992 --> 03:21:54.061
heavily. The king is looking a little rough. That
ends Kima's turn. Kima's going to try and make a

03:21:54.061 --> 03:22:03.329
saving throw. Kima pulls the blade out, and turns
to stone herself.

03:22:03.329 --> 03:22:08.754
LAURA: Oh shit. Shit, shit, shit. He's still at
like really high health, too. The king.

03:22:08.754 --> 03:22:10.387
SAM: What, he is?

03:22:10.387 --> 03:22:11.990
MATT: The king is looking a little rough.

03:22:11.990 --> 03:22:19.240
SAM: You never know. He might just start doing a
headstand.

03:22:19.240 --> 03:22:21.503
(laughter)

03:22:21.503 --> 03:22:23.287
MATT: The queen's turn.

03:22:23.287 --> 03:22:24.471
LAURA: Oh no.

03:22:24.471 --> 03:22:33.792
MATT: The queen looks over at Grog in front of
her, kinda frustratedly, uses a bulk of sorcery

03:22:33.792 --> 03:22:40.518
points, puts her hand up towards him as he's
pulling his axe back angrily. He fails his save.

03:22:40.518 --> 03:22:44.683
And he puts his axe back down and looks towards
the rest of the group.

03:22:44.683 --> 03:22:46.954
MARISHA: Oh no! Not again!

03:22:46.954 --> 03:22:49.214
MATT: Eye color glazed over.

03:22:49.214 --> 03:22:51.891
SAM: He's so easily influenced.

03:22:51.891 --> 03:22:53.714
LAURA: No, he's under her control.

03:22:53.714 --> 03:23:01.689
MATT: So that was her sorcery points, her quick
action. She then says, "We're not gonna die this

03:23:01.689 --> 03:23:10.685
"day alone and I won't die. My love, I'm sorry, but
there's much more work to be done." And she raises

03:23:10.685 --> 03:23:14.579
her hand up and you see this buildup of green
arcane energy at her hand. She turns it towards

03:23:14.579 --> 03:23:20.373
the rest of the group, faces it up towards the
ceiling and releases this pulse of arcane, green,

03:23:20.373 --> 03:23:25.291
ill-looking energy that blasts into the stone
ceiling. As it does, the stone itself

03:23:25.291 --> 03:23:31.571
disintegrates in a large chunk, and a glowing
mass of seeping, hot, molten magma begins to pour

03:23:31.571 --> 03:23:33.937
into the room.

03:23:33.937 --> 03:23:35.430
MARISHA: Oh shit!

03:23:35.430 --> 03:23:38.447
ORION: Where's it coming from?

03:23:38.447 --> 03:23:40.737
MATT: It's now coming from right here.

03:23:40.737 --> 03:23:42.058
LAURA: Oh my god.

03:23:42.058 --> 03:23:44.859
LIAM: (sings) TPK. TPK.

03:23:44.859 --> 03:23:50.404
MATT: So now, magma is pouring onto the throne
room from above. The giant fall that is on top of

03:23:50.404 --> 03:23:52.389
the fortress is now peering into the room.

03:23:52.389 --> 03:23:54.311
SAM: (high-pitched) Someone grab me and leave.

03:23:54.311 --> 03:24:03.833
MATT: That brings us to Tiberius, who is stone.
Clarota currently looks around and--

03:24:03.833 --> 03:24:07.132
ORION: Hold on. Am I conscious in stone form?

03:24:07.132 --> 03:24:11.224
MATT: No. You are a slate. You are a blue screen.
You are Grog after the intellect devourer.

03:24:11.224 --> 03:24:14.565
ASHLEY: Oh god, this is bad.

03:24:14.565 --> 03:24:16.076
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

03:24:16.076 --> 03:24:17.946
SAM: Pike, it's all on you, dude.

03:24:17.946 --> 03:24:20.597
MARISHA: Do you have water?

03:24:20.597 --> 03:24:23.835
ASHLEY: I can create it.

03:24:23.835 --> 03:24:33.027
MATT: Clarota steps back and grabs Lady Kima and
begins dragging her back through the doorway.

03:24:33.027 --> 03:24:35.276
LAURA: Oh god, we've got to get out. That's a
retreat.

03:24:35.276 --> 03:24:42.326
MATT: Pulling her down towards the stairway. That
brings us to Keyleth.

03:24:42.326 --> 03:24:47.672
SAM: Keyleth. Keyleth. Get us out of here.

03:24:47.672 --> 03:24:56.125
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. I come out of the form.
Yes, thank you.

03:24:56.125 --> 03:24:58.224
MATT: It's a free action.

03:24:58.224 --> 03:25:01.620
ORION: Isn't there a dead basilisk right in front
of us right now?

03:25:01.620 --> 03:25:04.410
MATT: There is a body of a dead basilisk on the
ground, yes.

03:25:04.410 --> 03:25:13.100
MARISHA: I'm going to take Wind Wall. I'm gonna
cast Wind Wall and try and wrap it around the lava

03:25:13.100 --> 03:25:17.885
column and try and contain it within the Wind
Wall, cooling it down. Essentially making a

03:25:17.885 --> 03:25:20.098
tornado-like vortex around the lava.

03:25:20.098 --> 03:25:24.925
MATT: Okay. For the purposes of this, I want you
to go ahead and make a basic religion check.

03:25:24.925 --> 03:25:27.387
MARISHA: Okay.

03:25:27.387 --> 03:25:30.717
MATT: Wait no, not religion. For you it'd be
nature. Just for the purposes of my thought, I

03:25:30.717 --> 03:25:33.735
think a nature check would be an interesting way
to see how this plays out.

03:25:33.735 --> 03:25:34.982
MARISHA: 18.

03:25:34.982 --> 03:25:42.210
MATT: 18? Okay. So, as you bring this gust of cold
wind, swirling around, the column of magma begins

03:25:42.210 --> 03:25:46.611
to cool and darken as Trinket is like backing up
against the wall and the magma is starting to

03:25:46.611 --> 03:25:55.388
singe the edge of Trinket's nails. It cools to a
dark, black, kind of rockish color. And the magma

03:25:55.388 --> 03:26:04.181
fall ceases, but you can see parts of it breaking
and beginning to break past that shell exterior.

03:26:04.181 --> 03:26:05.410
So you've slowed it.

03:26:05.410 --> 03:26:11.069
MARISHA: This isn't gonna hold for long! Somebody
rub some blood on Tiberius, quick, and let's get

03:26:11.069 --> 03:26:13.962
the hell out of here! I'm just holding this.

03:26:13.962 --> 03:26:19.095
MATT: Holding it there? Okay. That brings us to
Pike.

03:26:19.095 --> 03:26:23.968
ASHLEY: There's so much to do. I don't know if I
should heal you, if I should rub blood on you or

03:26:23.968 --> 03:26:26.285
if I should go try to remove the curse from Grog.

03:26:26.285 --> 03:26:29.426
LAURA: See if you can get the curse out of Grog.
Because if we've got to retreat, then--

03:26:29.426 --> 03:26:32.780
ASHLEY: Can Remove Curse remove the thing off of
him?

03:26:32.780 --> 03:26:35.692
MATT: From your knowledge, no, it's an arcane
effect, not a curse.

03:26:35.692 --> 03:26:41.065
ASHLEY: That's an arcane effect. Okay, so, Grog
might be on his own for a little bit. Okay. So can

03:26:41.065 --> 03:26:47.284
I heal Scanlan and then also rub some basilisk
blood on Tiberius?

03:26:47.284 --> 03:26:52.367
MATT: From your previous experience, it's not the
blood directly. The blood itself has to be

03:26:52.367 --> 03:26:58.208
distilled into a specific alchemical form to
reverse the effect.

03:26:58.208 --> 03:27:02.416
ORION: We just drank the blood last time.

03:27:02.416 --> 03:27:06.641
MATT: No, it wasn't drinking. After the battle,
you guys took the blood, prepared it, and then

03:27:06.641 --> 03:27:08.606
used it as part of the recovery.

03:27:08.606 --> 03:27:12.415
MARISHA: Will someone collect some blood?

03:27:12.415 --> 03:27:16.969
MATT: Okay, so you heal Scanlan. How much does he
heal?

03:27:16.969 --> 03:27:21.634
ORION: The king's almost dead.

03:27:21.634 --> 03:27:26.041
MARISHA: Do we want to kill the king? Do we need
somebody alive to help us?

03:27:26.041 --> 03:27:27.547
ASHLEY: Oh, 19, 19!

03:27:27.547 --> 03:27:32.243
MATT: So you're healed 19. You're on the ground,
prone, but you're conscious now.

03:27:32.243 --> 03:27:33.478
SAM: Hi!

03:27:33.478 --> 03:27:37.432
MATT: You look up at Pike and smile and you look
over and see this large column of magma that's now

03:27:37.432 --> 03:27:40.522
cracking through stone and pouring into the throne
room again.

03:27:40.522 --> 03:27:43.653
ASHLEY: Is there anything else we can do? Is there
anything else I can do at this moment?

03:27:43.653 --> 03:27:48.931
MATT: No, this has been a heal, this has been--
no, okay, you can move, that's about it.

03:27:48.931 --> 03:27:52.351
ASHLEY: I can move? Can I take anyone with me
while I move?

03:27:52.351 --> 03:27:54.818
MATT: I will say you can drag him. You'll be at
half speed.

03:27:54.818 --> 03:27:57.488
ASHLEY: Can I try to drag Tiberius away from the
magma?

03:27:57.488 --> 03:27:59.794
MATT: You can try. Make a strength check.

03:27:59.794 --> 03:28:03.233
SAM: You're two feet tall. He's a dragon.

03:28:03.233 --> 03:28:04.918
MATT: Let's say athletics, do athletics.

03:28:04.918 --> 03:28:09.351
ASHLEY: Athletics? 19.

03:28:09.351 --> 03:28:16.686
MATT: Okay. So, you grab onto Tiberius, you rush
over after healing him, grab and start dragging

03:28:16.686 --> 03:28:20.814
him towards the entrance. At half-speed you manage
to get him three squares, that's as far as you

03:28:20.814 --> 03:28:26.325
got. As you're pulling back, the king, as a
reaction, gets one strike on you with his sword.

03:28:26.325 --> 03:28:30.263
That's gonna be a 19.

03:28:30.263 --> 03:28:31.956
ASHLEY: Get outta here.

03:28:31.956 --> 03:28:33.069
(laughter)

03:28:33.069 --> 03:28:34.370
MATT: Your AC is 20?

03:28:34.370 --> 03:28:35.302
ASHLEY: It's 20.

03:28:35.302 --> 03:28:36.586
MATT: So the blade hits you--

03:28:36.586 --> 03:28:37.821
ASHLEY: I just flip him off.

03:28:37.821 --> 03:28:38.918
(laughter)

03:28:38.918 --> 03:28:41.916
MATT: The blade comes down towards you, but with a
flash of divine energy in your shoulder armor, it

03:28:41.916 --> 03:28:45.792
just gets deflected off the side and you glare at
him out of the side of your face. And continue to

03:28:45.792 --> 03:28:47.600
drag Tiberius out of the room.

03:28:47.600 --> 03:28:49.351
LIAM: Now go home and get your shine box.

03:28:49.351 --> 03:28:50.506
(laughter)

03:28:50.506 --> 03:28:51.755
MATT: All right. Percy, you're up.

03:28:51.755 --> 03:28:55.992
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to step into the
room, to give some cover. Right about, probably

03:28:55.992 --> 03:28:58.927
just slightly on the other end of this.

03:28:58.927 --> 03:29:01.024
MATT: Where, over here?

03:29:01.024 --> 03:29:04.008
TALIESIN: No, like, next to Keyleth, like near
Keyleth.

03:29:04.008 --> 03:29:08.468
MATT: Oh, you're gonna have to go around here,
then. This is a really harrowing place.

03:29:08.468 --> 03:29:16.947
TALIESIN: Okay, the first thing I'm going to do,
is I'm going to-- I've got my ice shot loaded. I'm

03:29:16.947 --> 03:29:20.759
going to take a shot at the break in the ceiling
and I'm gonna try and ice it over.

03:29:20.759 --> 03:29:24.949
MATT: Okay, all right. So as you pull over, you go
ahead and aim up with your ice shot ready. Go

03:29:24.949 --> 03:29:26.386
ahead and fire.

03:29:26.386 --> 03:29:27.897
TALIESIN: That's 20.

03:29:27.897 --> 03:29:31.672
MATT: 20 definitively hits. It's not hard to do.
Go ahead and roll damage and that will signify how

03:29:31.672 --> 03:29:36.355
long and how much it will stop. So just the ice
damage. Not the actual bullet, it won't do

03:29:36.355 --> 03:29:37.720
anything. So just--

03:29:37.720 --> 03:29:38.968
TALIESIN: Oh. So just the ice damage

03:29:38.968 --> 03:29:40.200
MATT: Just the ice damage.

03:29:40.200 --> 03:29:40.980
TALIESIN: Two.

03:29:40.980 --> 03:29:43.874
MATT: Two. Okay. So as you blast up, you can see,
as the magma's beginning to pour down again, you

03:29:43.874 --> 03:29:48.215
blast it and it immediately-- a spot cools into a
rock and begins to slip again. You've maybe given

03:29:48.215 --> 03:29:52.755
yourself a couple more seconds. That may be what
you need, you don't know. But that's all you got

03:29:52.755 --> 03:29:53.725
on that one.

03:29:53.725 --> 03:29:55.801
TALIESIN: Okay, my next shot, I'm just gonna turn
to the king and just shoot.

03:29:55.801 --> 03:29:57.134
MATT: Okay, go for it.

03:29:57.244 --> 03:30:02.084
TALIESIN: I'm also gonna spend a point for
additional damage. And I'm also taking

03:30:02.245 --> 03:30:04.847
Sharpshooter for additional damage.

03:30:04.847 --> 03:30:06.031
MATT: Okay.

03:30:06.031 --> 03:30:09.409
TALIESIN: That's 16.

03:30:09.409 --> 03:30:11.953
MATT: 16 versus armor class will not hit,
unfortunately.

03:30:11.953 --> 03:30:16.466
TALIESIN: Oh! Wait, okay, no, I just, I don't get
the-- oh god, it's not Pathfinder, gah!

03:30:16.466 --> 03:30:18.147
MATT: Yeah.

03:30:18.147 --> 03:30:21.326
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine. I'm gonna spend my
bonus action to take another shot.

03:30:21.326 --> 03:30:23.548
MATT: Okay, so you're using your Action Surge?

03:30:23.548 --> 03:30:24.403
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:30:24.403 --> 03:30:27.328
MATT: Okay. So Action Surge. You now have two more
attacks. Go for it.

03:30:27.328 --> 03:30:29.992
TALIESIN: 23, eff you.

03:30:29.992 --> 03:30:31.236
MATT: That hits.

03:30:31.236 --> 03:30:32.724
(laughter)

03:30:32.724 --> 03:30:35.909
TALIESIN: That's nine points of damage.

03:30:35.909 --> 03:30:38.144
MATT: Nine points of damage, got it.

03:30:38.144 --> 03:30:39.948
TALIESIN: Taking another shot.

03:30:39.948 --> 03:30:41.014
MATT: All right.

03:30:41.014 --> 03:30:47.407
TALIESIN: This shot's fire, fire bonus damage. And
I'm also gonna spend another grit point to maybe

03:30:47.407 --> 03:30:51.896
do a little more damage. 28 to hit.

03:30:51.896 --> 03:30:55.711
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. With
the extra grit point you do two dice, right?

03:30:55.711 --> 03:31:05.767
TALIESIN: Yeah. I get a bonus die, I just have to
find one. Oh, that'll do. That's 17 points of

03:31:05.767 --> 03:31:07.424
damage plus one point of fire damage.

03:31:07.424 --> 03:31:15.498
MATT: Nice. Okay, so, the next-- the first shot
fires, just ricochets off his armor and streaks

03:31:15.498 --> 03:31:18.992
across the room. You get his attention, though,
and he looks back at you with this kind of wild

03:31:18.992 --> 03:31:22.691
look in his eyes, the muscles tensing. You can see
the armor actually bending and twisting against

03:31:22.691 --> 03:31:28.235
his physical form underneath. However, the next
shot blasts off side of his jaw, there's actually

03:31:28.235 --> 03:31:31.658
a giant gap now in his flesh as he looks back at
you and you can see his teeth. And as he grits

03:31:31.658 --> 03:31:36.395
down towards you, now definitely intent on getting
vengeance on that, the second shot (impact sound)

03:31:36.395 --> 03:31:40.629
takes off a chunk of his head. You can see the
skull exposed on where you've now taken a piece of

03:31:40.629 --> 03:31:44.410
flesh off the top of his scalp. He's looking
pretty rough.

03:31:44.410 --> 03:31:49.430
TALIESIN: Let's move it, people. And I'm gonna
take like a step back towards the door. Just with

03:31:49.430 --> 03:31:52.146
what's remaining of my movement.

03:31:52.146 --> 03:31:57.801
MATT: Okay. You can get back to there. All right.
That brings us to--

03:31:57.801 --> 03:32:02.569
TALIESIN: Oh, I killed him, didn't I? No, he's not
dead, damn it.

03:32:02.569 --> 03:32:04.876
MATT: He's not dead yet. Not dead yet.

03:32:04.876 --> 03:32:06.749
TALIESIN: I know, that would've been so cool.

03:32:06.749 --> 03:32:15.500
MATT: All right. The mind flayer, who is no longer
dominated as Clarota took his attention off of

03:32:15.500 --> 03:32:21.566
that for the time being, looks around at everyone,
sees the circumstance, the magma flowing down, and

03:32:21.566 --> 03:32:25.559
just grabs his chest and you can see his form
blink out and vanish.

03:32:25.559 --> 03:32:28.122
ORION: (groans) He peaced out.

03:32:28.122 --> 03:32:35.196
MATT: That brings us to the top. Vax. At this
round, by the way, is broken and has begun to

03:32:35.196 --> 03:32:39.719
spread, the magma has now filled this much of the
room. And it's quickening.

03:32:39.719 --> 03:32:48.782
LIAM: My boots of haste are on, so I run-- I just
dart right around Grog, around that column, up to

03:32:48.782 --> 03:32:55.478
the queen, while pulling out my keen dagger, I
speak my mother's name, kiss the blade and shove

03:32:55.478 --> 03:32:58.836
it in, right into her collarbone.

03:32:58.836 --> 03:33:00.585
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for the attack.

03:33:00.585 --> 03:33:05.092
LIAM: So that's a two, but I'm gonna use Luck. I
get ad-- 20.

03:33:05.092 --> 03:33:06.170
MATT: 20 does hit.

03:33:06.170 --> 03:33:09.459
LIAM: Because of it, and because Grog's there,
this--

03:33:09.459 --> 03:33:11.578
MATT: Grog is not an ally, currently. You do not
get Sneak Attack.

03:33:11.578 --> 03:33:17.007
LIAM: Don't get Sneak Attack, all right. Three,
ten, then. That's the first attack. And the second

03:33:17.007 --> 03:33:20.736
one also hits, that's a 29.

03:33:20.736 --> 03:33:22.165
MATT: All right.

03:33:22.165 --> 03:33:23.564
LIAM: Is ten.

03:33:23.564 --> 03:33:30.033
MATT: Ten, nice. So the first blade plunges into
her clavicle, she maneuvers out of the way to the

03:33:30.033 --> 03:33:34.075
point where it misses any vital points, but still
sinks in. She looks at you angrily and you can see

03:33:34.075 --> 03:33:40.372
her dull white, ashy, duergar eyes flash with an
intense arcane rage. As you pull the blade out,

03:33:40.372 --> 03:33:46.050
her eyes dart around with some sort of a plan, a
thought process going through her head, as the

03:33:46.050 --> 03:33:50.254
other blade sinks into the side of her torso she
spits out blood that actually spatters across your

03:33:50.254 --> 03:33:56.480
face. She pushes the blade out and you see her
preparing herself for something. That ends your

03:33:56.480 --> 03:34:02.261
turn. Grog currently moves forward towards you.

03:34:02.261 --> 03:34:06.373
LIAM: (Grog voice) Wrong direction!

03:34:06.373 --> 03:34:10.153
MATT: That is a 25 versus armor class.

03:34:10.153 --> 03:34:12.122
LIAM: Yeah, but Uncanny Dodge!

03:34:12.122 --> 03:34:19.538
MATT: How many times can you-- you've already used
that. It's once per encounter. Once per encounter

03:34:19.538 --> 03:34:23.542
you can use that. Next one is a 21 versus armor
class?

03:34:23.542 --> 03:34:25.534
LIAM: Once a round.

03:34:25.534 --> 03:34:29.982
MATT: Once a round you can do it? Okay, well never
mind. So take half on that first attack. All

03:34:29.982 --> 03:34:37.747
right, so. First strike comes at you with a-- oof,
that'll be 19 points of damage. Reduced to nine.

03:34:37.747 --> 03:34:39.027
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

03:34:39.027 --> 03:34:46.306
MATT: Second strike hits you for a total of 15
points of damage. So 24 total.

03:34:46.306 --> 03:34:49.323
MARISHA: Could be worse.

03:34:49.323 --> 03:34:53.696
MATT: And that's Grog's go. That brings us to
Scanlan.

03:34:53.696 --> 03:34:55.202
LIAM: That really hurts, Grog.

03:34:55.202 --> 03:35:01.929
SAM: With my knowledge of the arcane arts, do I
have any knowledge that using my Dispel Magic

03:35:01.929 --> 03:35:05.745
spell would work on Grog? Or do I just have to try
it?

03:35:05.745 --> 03:35:11.949
MATT: It's a possibility. You know the spell
that's been cast on him-- you use it. There is a

03:35:11.949 --> 03:35:14.470
chance, but it has to be a contested roll.

03:35:14.470 --> 03:35:15.598
LIAM: You could roll a 20.

03:35:15.598 --> 03:35:17.355
MARISHA: You could roll a 20.

03:35:17.355 --> 03:35:20.706
SAM: Does it take my move to just stand up?

03:35:20.706 --> 03:35:24.809
MATT: Yes, it does, unfortunately. So it's your
call.

03:35:24.809 --> 03:35:28.286
SAM: But I don't have to be standing to cast a
spell--

03:35:28.286 --> 03:35:33.366
MATT: No, but I would say it's going to be
difficult, it's going to give--

03:35:33.366 --> 03:35:34.864
SAM: All right, I'll stand up.

03:35:34.864 --> 03:35:41.948
MATT: All right. You get back up. What are you
doing?

03:35:41.948 --> 03:35:48.406
SAM: And I will-- Jesus, is it better for me to
get out of there or get the king?

03:35:48.406 --> 03:35:50.708
LAURA: Yeah, get the king. You may be able to kill
him. He's on his last legs, probably.

03:35:50.708 --> 03:35:52.083
MATT: He's looking pretty rough.

03:35:52.083 --> 03:35:54.002
SAM: Yeah, but Keyleth is right behind him.

03:35:54.002 --> 03:35:55.612
LIAM: Do it. Stab him.

03:35:55.612 --> 03:35:57.019
LAURA: You can attack him with your sword.

03:35:57.019 --> 03:36:00.188
SAM: I am a tiny, tiny boy. I can only do--

03:36:00.188 --> 03:36:04.130
LAURA: Do it anyway. He's at his last legs. It
would be epic, Scanlan.

03:36:04.130 --> 03:36:07.269
MATT: What do you got? Go ahead, quick. Magma's
pouring through.

03:36:07.269 --> 03:36:16.186
SAM: Okay, I swing my Singing Dawnblade at him.
(laughs) I have a dawn blade. It's just so lame

03:36:16.186 --> 03:36:17.631
though! It's so weak!

03:36:17.631 --> 03:36:21.078
MATT: Okay, so. Go ahead and roll for an attack,
d20.

03:36:21.078 --> 03:36:23.247
SAM: A natural 20.

03:36:23.247 --> 03:36:25.775
(cheering)

03:36:25.775 --> 03:36:31.003
MARISHA: We said he could roll a 20! We called it!
Who called it? We called it.

03:36:31.003 --> 03:36:32.716
MATT: So, roll the dice.

03:36:32.716 --> 03:36:35.909
SAM: So that's eight.

03:36:35.909 --> 03:36:40.941
MATT: You rolled an eight. Times two, that's 16,
plus whatever the bonus damage is for the sword.

03:36:40.941 --> 03:36:47.666
SAM: Plus seven. Plus the dawn blade gets another
bonus attack at disadvantage.

03:36:47.666 --> 03:36:53.072
MATT: It does. So, you strike with a critical hit,
doing-- let's see, that's eight, 16, plus seven,

03:36:53.072 --> 03:36:55.800
23 points of damage, go ahead and roll for a
second attack.

03:36:55.800 --> 03:36:59.062
SAM: I've never hit anyone with a sword before!
Five.

03:36:59.062 --> 03:37:01.537
ASHLEY: Can I give him a War God's Blessing and
give him a plus ten?

03:37:01.537 --> 03:37:02.852
MATT: You can.

03:37:02.852 --> 03:37:04.400
ASHLEY: All right, plus ten, so fifteen.

03:37:04.400 --> 03:37:06.715
MATT: So what's your total? You rolled a five,
plus--

03:37:06.715 --> 03:37:10.103
SAM: Five plus-- ten-- I don't know, what am I
adding? I've never used a sword before!

03:37:10.103 --> 03:37:14.122
MATT: Add your proficiency modifier, which is
four, plus your strength modifier, so that's five

03:37:14.122 --> 03:37:17.760
to that, which is ten, makes it 20, which hits!
Roll damage on the attack.

03:37:17.760 --> 03:37:19.128
(cheering)

03:37:19.128 --> 03:37:20.806
MARISHA: Kill him, kill him!

03:37:20.806 --> 03:37:21.907
SAM: Six!

03:37:21.907 --> 03:37:26.292
MATT: Six points of damage. All right, six on that
plus your strength, which is one. Seven. Plus the

03:37:26.292 --> 03:37:32.391
dawn blade, which is-- that's eight. So that's
eight damage on top of the 23.

03:37:32.391 --> 03:37:33.759
How do you want to do this?

03:37:33.759 --> 03:37:35.326
(cheering)

03:37:35.326 --> 03:37:40.924
SAM: I-- as I draw back the blade, I say, oh! You
should've stood on your head! And I lop it off.

03:37:40.924 --> 03:37:50.083
MATT: So. As you say that, you-- the blade
vibrates to the sound of your voice, like the

03:37:50.083 --> 03:37:55.772
echoing of a song of Scanlan behind yours in
almost a chorus out of nowhere. The blade streaks

03:37:55.772 --> 03:38:01.462
through the air, coming down, slitting across the
back of his Achilles' tendon. He instinctually

03:38:01.462 --> 03:38:04.419
falls to one knee, which is kind of the height
level for you. As you do, you bring the blade

03:38:04.419 --> 03:38:10.385
around with a flourish and take Murghol's head off
his shoulders. It spins, tumbles to the ground,

03:38:10.385 --> 03:38:18.140
and rolls across the floor into the magma.
Blackened beard curling back as the rest of his

03:38:18.140 --> 03:38:23.391
face is melted away by the lava, which is now
pouring pretty heavily into this room.

03:38:23.391 --> 03:38:25.838
SAM: (sings) Scanlan make you feel good!

03:38:25.838 --> 03:38:30.796
MATT: All right. So that's your action. And your
movement. And your bonus action. No, you did your

03:38:30.796 --> 03:38:32.044
bonus action to do the extra attack.

03:38:32.044 --> 03:38:33.905
SAM: Oh! Great, great. I don't know how to use
swords!

03:38:33.905 --> 03:38:41.894
MATT: All right, so. That's the end of your turn.
Wow! You used a sword! And got a kill! On a boss!

03:38:41.894 --> 03:38:42.980
SAM: Yay!

03:38:42.980 --> 03:38:44.615
ASHLEY: Good job, Scanlan!

03:38:44.615 --> 03:38:49.859
MATT: All right, King Murghol's turn would be now,
but he's on the ground. Vex?

03:38:49.859 --> 03:38:57.435
LAURA: I call Trinket back. Get him away from that
lava. I run past, 'cause I can't-- can I see? Do I

03:38:57.435 --> 03:39:00.012
have an angle or is it being blocked by molten
tornado?

03:39:00.012 --> 03:39:02.106
MATT: You-- it's completely blocked right now.

03:39:02.106 --> 03:39:04.006
LAURA: Can I run across behind it?

03:39:04.006 --> 03:39:05.593
MATT: Through here?

03:39:05.593 --> 03:39:08.491
LAURA: Yeah. Is that magmous right now?

03:39:08.491 --> 03:39:12.772
MATT: Yeah, it is. It's still pouring! She slowed
it down, but it's still breaking through and

03:39:12.772 --> 03:39:16.407
pouring out slower. It would be even bigger if
they hadn't slowed it.

03:39:16.407 --> 03:39:19.580
LAURA: Okay, then well, maybe I won't run in that
direction. I run in the other direction and down--

03:39:19.580 --> 03:39:21.840
yeah. So I can see.

03:39:21.840 --> 03:39:23.255
MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack.

03:39:23.255 --> 03:39:24.365
LAURA: Okay.

03:39:24.365 --> 03:39:25.510
MATT: First attack.

03:39:25.510 --> 03:39:31.559
LAURA: First attack is (sings) 20. No. 19.

03:39:31.559 --> 03:39:32.500
MATT: Hits.

03:39:32.500 --> 03:39:36.931
LAURA: Yes! Okay. 14.

03:39:36.931 --> 03:39:38.794
MATT: 14 points of damage.

03:39:38.794 --> 03:39:47.440
LAURA: Second attack is-- Second attack is (sings)
21!

03:39:47.440 --> 03:39:49.307
MATT: Hits. Roll damage on that.

03:39:49.307 --> 03:39:52.292
LAURA: What's that? 12?

03:39:52.292 --> 03:39:53.919
MATT: 12 to hit?

03:39:53.919 --> 03:39:54.692
LAURA: Yeah.

03:39:54.692 --> 03:39:55.814
MATT: Or 12 damage?

03:39:55.814 --> 03:39:56.793
LAURA: 12 damage.

03:39:56.793 --> 03:39:58.012
MATT: All right, 12 damage.

03:39:58.012 --> 03:40:00.843
LAURA: Oh, um. Hunter's Mark. Damn it.

03:40:00.843 --> 03:40:02.295
Bonus action!

03:40:02.295 --> 03:40:05.057
MATT: Yep. All right, so both arrows (impact
sounds). One clips her in the leg, and the other

03:40:05.057 --> 03:40:10.209
embeds itself in her abdomen. You see she grabs
for it. She's looking really rough. Next is Kima.

03:40:10.209 --> 03:40:16.784
Kima's stone. It's now the queen's turn. She looks
over at you who's stabbed her, the arrows in her

03:40:16.784 --> 03:40:22.280
abdomen, and she looks up at Grog and says,
(sighs) "We've got business elsewhere." And she

03:40:22.280 --> 03:40:25.738
reaches out and touches Grog. Both of them blink
out, Dimension Door.

03:40:25.738 --> 03:40:27.321
SAM: We've lost Grog again!

03:40:27.321 --> 03:40:32.413
MATT: A very familiar purplish color as you've
seen you cast it, they Dimension Door out of the

03:40:32.413 --> 03:40:34.020
entire vicinity.

03:40:34.020 --> 03:40:36.134
SAM: Son of a--

03:40:36.134 --> 03:40:39.443
MARISHA: This is the second time we've lost Grog.

03:40:39.443 --> 03:40:43.712
MATT: At which point, the stone rocks crack on the
column and the magma now goes into full pour.

03:40:43.712 --> 03:40:45.425
LAURA: We've got to get out!

03:40:45.425 --> 03:40:47.936
MATT: You guys have to get out of that tunnel.
What do you do now, what's the process?

03:40:47.936 --> 03:40:49.038
ASHLEY: We run!

03:40:49.038 --> 03:40:51.041
SAM: Wait, we gotta get our stone friends out.

03:40:51.041 --> 03:40:54.518
MATT: So, this is going into a skill challenge
now.

03:40:54.518 --> 03:40:58.486
LAURA: Yeah, we all run out that--

03:40:58.486 --> 03:41:02.939
SAM: No, we don't all run out, they're stone, we
have to drag them out, yeah.

03:41:02.939 --> 03:41:06.448
LIAM: Who all's stone, it's Tiberius
and Kima? Okay.

03:41:06.719 --> 03:41:09.655
MARISHA: Can we-- where's the magic carpet? Throw
their asses on the magic carpet!

03:41:09.655 --> 03:41:17.059
LAURA: Grog has the magic carpet. Grog had
everything.

03:41:17.179 --> 03:41:20.834
SAM: Wait, Feather Fall, do you have Feather
Fall?

03:41:20.834 --> 03:41:24.327
ASHLEY: Before, before we leave, can I take some
of the basilisk's blood and put it in a vial?

03:41:24.327 --> 03:41:28.452
MATT: Okay, this will be the first skill
challenge. Go ahead and make a dexterity check.

03:41:28.452 --> 03:41:29.512
ASHLEY: Dexterity check?

03:41:29.512 --> 03:41:35.726
MARISHA: Oh, can we get the magic carpet now?

03:41:35.726 --> 03:41:39.577
MATT: No, the magic carpet is in the bag of
holding. That thing is huge. You carry that with

03:41:39.577 --> 03:41:41.795
you, you would be at disadvantage for everything
you've been doing.

03:41:41.795 --> 03:41:43.183
ORION: Oh, I see.

03:41:43.183 --> 03:41:44.398
ASHLEY: 18!

03:41:44.398 --> 03:41:49.465
MATT: 18, okay, so. I mean, you go over to it, and
you manage to gather up into your wine skin a

03:41:49.465 --> 03:41:55.014
little bit of basilisk's blood, best you can. The
magma pulls close to you and you manage to just

03:41:55.014 --> 03:42:00.829
take six points of fire damage from just the
general heat of the magma now pouring into the

03:42:00.829 --> 03:42:04.696
room. It's spilling out and now just continuing to
fill the rest of this chamber.

03:42:04.696 --> 03:42:06.687
LIAM: I shout to Percy, come, Tiberius, now!

03:42:06.687 --> 03:42:07.818
TALIESIN: We pick him up.

03:42:07.818 --> 03:42:11.314
MATT: Both of you guys make an athletics check.

03:42:11.314 --> 03:42:13.477
SAM: Oh, it's not a strength check?

03:42:13.477 --> 03:42:15.699
MATT: For this, this is just an athletics to pull
them all off.

03:42:15.699 --> 03:42:16.832
LIAM: 19.

03:42:16.832 --> 03:42:18.547
TALIESIN: 17.

03:42:18.547 --> 03:42:23.304
MATT: Okay. You guys grab and pull Tiberius out of
the room. It takes the two of you to heft him

03:42:23.304 --> 03:42:28.898
over. You manage to pull him out of the way, that
works out well. Down the stairway, all right. We

03:42:28.898 --> 03:42:31.891
don't need the video for this, we're just going to
do this visually. So, you guys manage to bring

03:42:31.891 --> 03:42:34.599
Tiberius down the stairway. What are you doing,
Scanlan?

03:42:34.599 --> 03:42:40.457
SAM: I'm unfurling my Bull's Strength scroll and
reading it so I get a plus five to strength? Is

03:42:40.457 --> 03:42:41.473
that a thing?

03:42:41.473 --> 03:42:44.874
MATT: All right, so that's Enhance Ability. So you
go ahead and give yourself Enhance Ability. Your

03:42:44.874 --> 03:42:47.282
strength is now-- you have advantage on all of
your strength checks.

03:42:47.282 --> 03:42:52.474
SAM: Okay, and I start to help, who was pushing
Kima? I'm gonna help push Kima out.

03:42:52.474 --> 03:42:56.091
LAURA: Oh wait, no! Wait, didn't Clarota take
Kima?

03:42:56.091 --> 03:42:57.668
MATT: No, Clarota pulled Kima out of the room.

03:42:57.668 --> 03:42:59.444
LAURA: Oh, so we're all fucking fine, let's just
get out.

03:42:59.444 --> 03:43:00.550
MATT: So you guys are fine.

03:43:00.550 --> 03:43:04.801
MARISHA: I go ahead and on our way out I cast
Create Water, and I kinda just use my air ability

03:43:04.801 --> 03:43:09.112
and make a mist to try and like mist the lava
that's coming towards us.

03:43:09.112 --> 03:43:13.502
MATT: Okay. You do, but the magma's so intense and
this has filled so much of the room now that you

03:43:13.502 --> 03:43:17.466
get a localized area. The rest of it just kinda
flows around and continues to fill the space. All

03:43:17.466 --> 03:43:21.772
right, so. All of you guys make a dexterity check
to try to get down quickly. Go for it.

03:43:21.772 --> 03:43:22.738
ASHLEY: Can I make another one?

03:43:22.738 --> 03:43:24.114
MATT: Yes, everyone makes one.

03:43:24.114 --> 03:43:25.468
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

03:43:25.468 --> 03:43:27.236
LIAM: Natural 20.

03:43:27.236 --> 03:43:30.396
ORION: (hoarsely) I rolled a 19!

03:43:30.396 --> 03:43:31.749
MARISHA: 20.

03:43:31.749 --> 03:43:33.431
SAM: (sings) Seven!

03:43:33.431 --> 03:43:34.620
ASHLEY: Four!

03:43:34.620 --> 03:43:37.185
LAURA: Do I get to roll twice 'cause of terrain?

03:43:37.185 --> 03:43:39.287
MATT: Because of-- yes you do.

03:43:39.287 --> 03:43:41.092
SAM: Do I get my Enhance Ability?

03:43:41.092 --> 03:43:42.380
MATT: Not for this one.

03:43:42.380 --> 03:43:45.188
ORION: I would like to note that I am frozen like
this.

03:43:45.188 --> 03:43:46.572
MATT: Okay, Tiberius is.

03:43:46.572 --> 03:43:47.656
LAURA: 29.

03:43:47.656 --> 03:43:52.230
MATT: Okay, gotcha. So, Pike and Scanlan, both of
you guys are, unfortunately 'cause you're smaller

03:43:52.230 --> 03:43:56.119
and your legs are moving, you guys rush down the
stairway and curl around. As the rest of you make

03:43:56.119 --> 03:44:01.161
your way to the door, which is currently closed,
you are all kinda gathered at the exterior of

03:44:01.161 --> 03:44:06.771
that hidden doorway. It's currently dark and held
shut on where you guys entered. However, you two,

03:44:07.015 --> 03:44:10.877
the magma's now reached the stairway. It's
beginning to pour down off the top, and it manages

03:44:10.877 --> 03:44:17.019
to catch the two of you. You guys each take five
points of heat damage from the magma's proximity.

03:44:17.019 --> 03:44:18.594
LIAM: To the two ladies?

03:44:18.594 --> 03:44:23.213
MATT: No, Pike and Scanlan. You guys make it to
the bottom floor. The doorway is currently closed

03:44:23.213 --> 03:44:25.429
for the secret exit of the fortress.

03:44:25.429 --> 03:44:32.800
LIAM: Vax drops Tiberius' stone ass to the ground
and starts feeling to get the mechanism of the

03:44:32.800 --> 03:44:33.982
door open.

03:44:33.982 --> 03:44:37.358
SAM: Are we at the foot of the stairs yet, me and
Pike?

03:44:37.358 --> 03:44:39.114
MATT: You guys just make it to the foot of the
stairs. You guys are now--

03:44:39.114 --> 03:44:40.435
MARISHA: It's a big stone door?

03:44:40.435 --> 03:44:42.329
MATT: Yeah, it's the one you guys, the one you
guys-- it opens up, outward.

03:44:42.329 --> 03:44:46.209
MARISHA: I just cast Stone Shape and make a hole.

03:44:46.209 --> 03:44:50.595
MATT: Okay, as you're feeling around for the
mechanism, Keyleth steps forward and basically the

03:44:50.595 --> 03:44:53.416
stone turns into almost a clay, and she just pulls
it apart.

03:44:53.416 --> 03:44:57.385
MARISHA: Sorry, Vax. I didn't mean to, like,
overstep there.

03:44:57.385 --> 03:45:00.692
MATT: A giant glob of magma pours down and
splashes down onto the ground, hitting everyone in

03:45:00.692 --> 03:45:06.038
the vicinity. Everyone down here takes 12 points
of heat damage.

03:45:06.038 --> 03:45:08.630
LIAM: Ah, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot!

03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:10.268
LAURA: Hot hot hot hot hot.

03:45:10.268 --> 03:45:14.098
LIAM: All right, I'm picking up Tiberius' stone
butt and continuing--

03:45:14.098 --> 03:45:19.321
MATT: Okay, you guys push through the open hole
that Keyleth pushed in, sweat dripping down your

03:45:19.321 --> 03:45:24.919
faces as the heat proximity to you is
nigh-intolerable. You make your way out of the

03:45:24.919 --> 03:45:27.539
gate and now you have that giant magma flow.

03:45:27.539 --> 03:45:29.859
LAURA: Oh, right! Is the thing not-- wasn't
there--

03:45:29.859 --> 03:45:34.593
MATT: No no-- as you guys go and step out, the
doorway that opened up, previously? Is what parted

03:45:34.593 --> 03:45:38.060
the magma flow. You pulled it open, so now it's
just a wall of magma in front of you.

03:45:38.060 --> 03:45:39.939
LAURA: She also had created a wall barrier.

03:45:39.939 --> 03:45:41.306
MARISHA: I did create a wall over top.

03:45:41.306 --> 03:45:42.655
MATT: You did. It's not there anymore.

03:45:42.655 --> 03:45:43.750
MARISHA: It was permanent!

03:45:43.750 --> 03:45:47.806
MATT: It was permanent, but a perpetual flow of
magma on it for a period of a few hours will

03:45:47.806 --> 03:45:49.407
eventually eat through a stone wall.

03:45:49.407 --> 03:45:50.654
LAURA: Can you cast it again?

03:45:50.654 --> 03:45:53.780
MARISHA: I can. Yeah. Do it again. Bam.

03:45:53.780 --> 03:45:57.624
MATT: Okay. It's probably the last of that. You
create a stone wall that juts out, once again

03:45:57.624 --> 03:46:03.985
blocking off the magma flow. You guys all step out
of the room just as the main force of magma begins

03:46:03.985 --> 03:46:07.910
to fill the room behind you. Everyone make one
more dexterity check to get out in time, as it's a

03:46:07.910 --> 03:46:09.660
small space and you're pushing out.

03:46:09.660 --> 03:46:11.264
SAM: Natural 20.

03:46:11.264 --> 03:46:13.602
ORION: 16.

03:46:13.602 --> 03:46:14.917
MATT: You made nothing.

03:46:14.917 --> 03:46:17.142
MARISHA: "You made nothing." Seven.

03:46:17.142 --> 03:46:18.381
TALIESIN: Ten.

03:46:18.381 --> 03:46:20.377
ASHLEY: Two.

03:46:20.377 --> 03:46:21.544
LAURA: Oh no. 29.

03:46:21.544 --> 03:46:22.691
LIAM: 12.

03:46:22.691 --> 03:46:31.857
MATT: Okay. Everyone under 15: you, you, Percy, I
believe, and Keyleth. The magma now, as you're

03:46:31.857 --> 03:46:36.236
helping getting your friends out, you're pushing
out, you push Vex out-- Vex darts out, Scanlan

03:46:36.236 --> 03:46:42.292
manages to get out. As you guys are pulling
Tiberius through, the hefty force of magma comes

03:46:42.292 --> 03:46:45.511
funneling down into the room and splashes across
the floor.

03:46:45.511 --> 03:46:51.054
TALIESIN: Oh, that's a lot of dice.

03:46:51.054 --> 03:46:55.755
MATT: That is 18 points of heat damage.

03:46:55.755 --> 03:46:57.084
LIAM: Vax is unconscious.

03:46:57.084 --> 03:46:58.760
MARISHA: 18 points?

03:46:58.760 --> 03:47:03.289
MATT: As you're pushing through, Vax, you fall
unconscious as the magma is currently lapping at

03:47:03.289 --> 03:47:07.514
the back of your leg. The rest of you begin
pushing out as you begin to realize that your

03:47:07.514 --> 03:47:10.493
half-elf friend is currently melting in a pool of
magma.

03:47:10.493 --> 03:47:12.389
ASHLEY: Can I grab him? Can I grab him out?

03:47:12.389 --> 03:47:17.085
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength check. This is
strength at this point, this is pure adrenaline

03:47:17.085 --> 03:47:18.771
pushing through.

03:47:18.771 --> 03:47:21.464
ASHLEY: 12!

03:47:21.464 --> 03:47:25.230
MATT: 12. You manage to start pulling him up
through the hole that Keyleth made.

03:47:25.230 --> 03:47:30.043
TALIESIN: I'm going to assist, I'm pulling out--
I'm doing another ice shot to try and cool off the

03:47:30.043 --> 03:47:30.940
magma around him.

03:47:30.940 --> 03:47:32.356
LAURA: I send Trinket up, to like, pull him.

03:47:32.356 --> 03:47:34.678
MATT: Before you get to that point, as you're
readying for it, 'cause it's a small space-- as

03:47:34.678 --> 03:47:42.992
you're pulling it, giant bear claws come over and
latch onto the back of Vax's armor. The grizzly

03:47:42.992 --> 03:47:49.605
bear begins to tense, pulling back. Makes a
strength check. That'll do it. Both of you manage

03:47:49.605 --> 03:47:55.604
to pull you out. You take an additional bit of
heat damage. You are now at two failed saving

03:47:55.604 --> 03:47:57.943
throws. Two failed death saving throws.

03:47:57.943 --> 03:47:59.865
LIAM: I am a centimeter away from real death.

03:47:59.865 --> 03:48:04.665
MATT: As he pulls it out, you can see most of his
foot is melted. And his right leg.

03:48:04.665 --> 03:48:06.372
SAM: Aw, that's his best leg.

03:48:06.372 --> 03:48:09.348
TALIESIN: I pull a level two healing potion, just
get it in his mouth.

03:48:09.348 --> 03:48:12.086
MATT: Okay, you pull it out. At this point, the
magma's beginning to fill up the room,

03:48:12.086 --> 03:48:13.088
by the way.

03:48:13.088 --> 03:48:16.550
MARISHA: Okay, wait wait wait, can I take my stone
wall and like, close it off?

03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:17.704
We're all out, right?

03:48:17.704 --> 03:48:19.418
MATT: You're outside of it. How long does Stone
Shape last?

03:48:19.418 --> 03:48:21.128
MARISHA: Stone Shape?

03:48:21.128 --> 03:48:22.304
MATT: What you used on the wall.

03:48:22.304 --> 03:48:24.696
MARISHA: I'm just-- I'm just taking it away.

03:48:24.696 --> 03:48:25.788
MATT: Closing the wall?

03:48:25.788 --> 03:48:27.519
MARISHA: I'm closing it. I can do it again, I
still have two more spell slots.

03:48:27.519 --> 03:48:29.092
MATT: Okay, how many spells do you have at that
level?

03:48:29.092 --> 03:48:30.598
MARISHA: Three.

03:48:30.598 --> 03:48:31.926
MATT: Three. So you spent--

03:48:31.926 --> 03:48:33.308
MARISHA: One, so far.

03:48:33.308 --> 03:48:36.004
MATT: One going out, coming-- no, wait, it's the
same-- you haven't had a chance to do a full

03:48:36.004 --> 03:48:37.258
night's rest.

03:48:37.258 --> 03:48:41.309
MARISHA: I know. I was an animal all week-- all
last game. I didn't use any last game.

03:48:41.309 --> 03:48:43.278
MATT: That's true, so you used the stone form,
used Stone Wall.

03:48:43.278 --> 03:48:46.509
MARISHA: I used one Stone Wall last week and I
have two level five spells now.

03:48:46.509 --> 03:48:49.854
MATT: That's true, that's true, you do, that's
good. All right, I just wanted to make sure. Okay,

03:48:49.854 --> 03:48:52.977
so as you do that, you send up another Stone Wall.
It blocks off the magma just as it begins to pour

03:48:52.977 --> 03:48:58.162
over and spill out into this vicinity. It'll last
a short time, but it'll last enough for what you

03:48:58.162 --> 03:48:59.614
guys need. You guys drag--

03:48:59.614 --> 03:49:00.634
ASHLEY: Can I heal him?

03:49:00.634 --> 03:49:03.802
MATT: You can attempt to, yeah, go for it.

03:49:03.802 --> 03:49:09.691
LAURA: Anticipation.

03:49:09.691 --> 03:49:12.185
MARISHA: I know. C'mon, Pike!

03:49:12.185 --> 03:49:13.440
ASHLEY: 24.

03:49:13.440 --> 03:49:15.503
MATT: All right. Heals you.

03:49:15.503 --> 03:49:17.289
LAURA: Oh my god.

03:49:17.289 --> 03:49:20.247
MATT: Comes to consciousness. You guys are about
ten feet away from the base of the stronghold.

03:49:20.247 --> 03:49:26.121
Your foot heals up, but it's still burned.

03:49:26.121 --> 03:49:27.745
LAURA: Ew, get that away from me.

03:49:27.745 --> 03:49:35.205
MATT: For the time being, until you can take some
serious physical rest, your movement is reduced by

03:49:35.205 --> 03:49:40.569
five. And your stealth rolls are currently at
disadvantage.

03:49:40.569 --> 03:49:43.201
ASHLEY: Can that ever be healed?

03:49:43.201 --> 03:49:48.696
MATT: Over time with some rest it can be, but
right now-- like, you're healed up, but that foot

03:49:48.696 --> 03:49:54.935
is scarred. It probably spent a good six seconds
completely submerged in molten lava.

03:49:54.935 --> 03:49:57.763
LIAM: Are you telling me I'll never compete in the
roller derby again?

03:49:57.763 --> 03:49:58.836
(laughter)

03:49:58.836 --> 03:50:04.249
MATT: Quite possibly. You all are just on the
outskirts of the stronghold. You can see now

03:50:04.249 --> 03:50:11.423
elements of the windows of the top floor are
beginning to glow with internal light, as the

03:50:11.423 --> 03:50:15.448
entire stronghold is currently filling up entirely
with molten rock.

03:50:15.448 --> 03:50:17.927
SAM: Oh, I left my keys in there!

03:50:17.927 --> 03:50:19.301
(laughter)

03:50:19.301 --> 03:50:24.737
MATT: You're all resting for a moment, off to the
side. Grog is missing. And you all take a

03:50:24.737 --> 03:50:28.854
moment to realize that somehow you all managed to
survive this, mostly.

03:50:28.854 --> 03:50:30.076
MARISHA: Sort of.

03:50:30.076 --> 03:50:35.764
MATT: However, you didn't find the vault, didn't
find Kima's stuff, and a number of escaped

03:50:35.764 --> 03:50:43.107
individuals from this are out and at large. We'll
end today's game on that note.

03:50:43.107 --> 03:50:46.217
LIAM: Percy, I need Bad News to be my other foot
now.

03:50:46.217 --> 03:50:50.914
MARISHA: Yeah, you should have-- you need, like, a
sweet pimp swagger now.

03:50:50.914 --> 03:50:54.697
MATT: So that went a little long, guys. Thank you
for your-- for hanging out, but that was an

03:50:54.697 --> 03:50:58.186
intense session. Some climactic moments there.

03:50:58.186 --> 03:51:01.932
LIAM: Are you sure you guys don't want to send in
a bulette, right now?

03:51:01.932 --> 03:51:05.649
MARISHA: Yeah, or maybe, like, you know, a black
ooze. You wanna do that?

03:51:05.649 --> 03:51:07.259
SAM: Wow, guys.

03:51:07.259 --> 03:51:09.193
ZAC: That was fucking intense.

03:51:09.193 --> 03:51:10.569
MATT: That was crazy!

03:51:10.569 --> 03:51:16.229
ZAC: Guys. Riveting. And exhausting. Are you guys
tired?

03:51:16.229 --> 03:51:17.550
ALL: Yes.

03:51:17.550 --> 03:51:20.036
ZAC: No dancing tonight, guys, get over it.

03:51:20.036 --> 03:51:21.546
ASHLEY: Sorry it went late.

03:51:21.546 --> 03:51:23.547
LAURA: That went so long, I'm sorry guys.

03:51:23.547 --> 03:51:28.868
ZAC: No, they are happy that you went late. They
want you to stay forever.

03:51:28.868 --> 03:51:30.449
MATT: That was nuts.

03:51:30.449 --> 03:51:36.918
ZAC: So I wanted to make a couple announcements of
people that helped out tonight. Not just donators,

03:51:36.918 --> 03:51:41.171
oh so-- I'm gonna read off a couple of people who
helped out first and then we're gonna start off

03:51:41.171 --> 03:51:47.467
reading off people who donated to the charity. If
you want us to read off who you are and your

03:51:47.467 --> 03:51:51.220
message to the Critical Role crew, you still have
time to donate, 'cause I'll start at the bottom

03:51:51.220 --> 03:51:57.507
and work my way up. So if the mods could post the
link to, you know, the command for Critical Role

03:51:57.507 --> 03:52:03.593
and you guys'll see there's a link there to
donate. Donate to 826LA. Every little bit helps

03:52:03.593 --> 03:52:10.904
these guys a lot and it would be really helpful to
the stream and the show. These guys have been

03:52:10.904 --> 03:52:16.179
working really hard and Matt puts in a ton of time
and to show your support, go donate to the charity

03:52:16.179 --> 03:52:19.523
and we'll get to your messages.

03:52:19.641 --> 03:52:22.893
Okay, so first off, I'm gonna thank
the_Duganator8--

03:52:22.893 --> 03:52:24.998
MARISHA: Yes! Was it the Duganator's birthday?

03:52:24.998 --> 03:52:26.086
ZAC: Yes!

03:52:26.086 --> 03:52:29.206
ALL: Happy birthday, Duganator!

03:52:29.206 --> 03:52:32.914
MARISHA: (sings) Happy happy birthday, from all of
us to you. We wish it was our birthdays, so...

03:52:32.914 --> 03:52:35.839
we're partying. Yay, woohoo!

03:52:35.839 --> 03:52:37.557
ZAC: Way to not use the copywritten one.

03:52:37.557 --> 03:52:40.498
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah, way to not use the
copywritten one, yeah.

03:52:40.498 --> 03:52:46.130
ZAC: Arislan and Alduin and JakeBoudreaux and
Negihama and Duganator8 were all the ones that

03:52:46.130 --> 03:52:48.118
pitched in to buy dinner for you guys.

03:52:48.118 --> 03:52:53.837
MARISHA: Thank you guys, we love it, cupcakes!
Happy birthday.

03:52:53.837 --> 03:53:02.573
ZAC: And then as a quick update for what's
happening tomorrow, we have three performances

03:53:02.573 --> 03:53:06.761
tomorrow night. So tomorrow is Gather Your Party
and it's kinda like our bring your friends, have a

03:53:06.761 --> 03:53:10.617
good time with board games and music and
everything. So Indiecade's coming by tomorrow

03:53:10.617 --> 03:53:16.187
night to show off some new board games. And then
we have two bands playing, Sonja Midtune and

03:53:16.187 --> 03:53:21.351
Bearwolf. And then we have the musical improv
group that was here during the charity drive is

03:53:21.351 --> 03:53:25.819

and The Accidental Party, and that's tomorrow

03:53:25.819 --> 03:53:31.164
night, it'll be a lot of fun. So I'm just gonna
pull up these donations and messages, if you

03:53:31.164 --> 03:53:37.348
wanted to see and start going through 'em. And
we'll probably have more as we get to the top. So

03:53:37.348 --> 03:53:44.205
starting at Fifthdreamtoday said, "I love Critical
role, kudos for giving to a great cause."

03:53:44.205 --> 03:53:45.828
MATT: Oh thank you, Fifthdreamertoday.
