00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.224
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.224 --> 00:00:06.394
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.394 --> 00:00:13.868
LIAM: It's been a while! So long since Matthew
Mercer ran Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:15.866
MATT: It's been a nice break.

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.992
TRAVIS: That chair has been violated by more than
a few people.

00:00:17.992 --> 00:00:19.506
MATT: I can smell it.

00:00:19.506 --> 00:00:20.882
TRAVIS: They told me to wear pants.

00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:28.177
MATT: The very onion musk you got from that end of
the table. I miss it; I do! I'm excited for the

00:00:28.177 --> 00:00:32.641
new campaign and the new year. I've been working
really hard on that world. I hope you guys are

00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:36.540
excited, too. We'll have information about that
first game soon. But tonight, we're excited

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.205
because we get to have the fantastic Jennifer Hale
join us!

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:46.810
JENNIFER: I am honored and terrified. I am a
virgin.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.484
TRAVIS: A quote, right above your head, "Honored
and terrified."

00:00:49.484 --> 00:00:51.308
JENNIFER: Call me HT.

00:00:51.308 --> 00:00:57.157
MATT: There you go. Hashtag. We're happy to have
you. Excited for you to play. Once again, don't

00:00:57.157 --> 00:01:00.396
feel stressed. Ask questions if you need them.
People are here to help you. You'll be good.

00:01:00.396 --> 00:01:03.074
LAURA: Be stressed. Very, very stressed.

00:01:03.074 --> 00:01:10.031
MATT: Laura, we talked about this. Tonight, on top
of that, we have a very special one-shot. The

00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:15.762
fantastic folks at Blizzard have come together and
asked us to do a Hearthstone one-shot in

00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:22.034
celebration of the upcoming expansion, Kobolds &amp;
Catacombs. Super excited about that. For those who

00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:26.486
aren't aware of it, it's an upcoming expansion for
the card game, Hearthstone, that brings the

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:31.219
classic fantasy dungeon crawl element to the
awesome, existing card game. It incorporates a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.298
bunch of cool, mysterious magical items, nine new
legendary weapons, some of which you'll recognize

00:01:36.298 --> 00:01:40.805
if you've played World of Warcraft in the recent
expansions. There's unidentified magical items

00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:45.129
that you can find in the game, so this has
definitely more of a D&amp;D, classic-dungeon-crawl

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:49.291
feel. There's spell stones you have to power as
you go through. It's got a lot of really cool new

00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:53.489
mechanics that add to the game. They have a
single-player dungeon run mode now, where you're

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:58.123
actually doing a dungeon delve with your Hearthstone
deck, playing through a storyline, making choices.

00:01:58.123 --> 00:02:03.622
It brings a whole new kind of tabletop element to
the game. I've seen a bunch of it. They even had

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:06.836
me come and sing in the trailer, so I've been tied
to this--

00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:08.819
LAURA: It was so fabulous, Matt!

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.673
MATT: Possibly other elements of the expansion.
But it's been really fun and we're excited for you

00:02:14.673 --> 00:02:18.644
guys to check it out. For those who've been
playing the game, there's a new mechanic called

00:02:18.644 --> 00:02:22.280
recruit, which allows you to recruit members to
your party, basically minions from your deck, to

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.450
help you out. So there's a whole bunch of new
mechanics that work out for the new dungeon-run

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.384
mode and other elements of the game, so definitely
look forward to checking that out. It is coming

00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:41.842
out December 7th, so right around the corner. Keep
an eye out for that. Go to bit.ly/crhearth to stay

00:02:41.842 --> 00:02:47.878
up to date and learn more. Also, to celebrate the
release of Hearthstone, the people at Blizzard

00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:54.401
have created a custom kobold escape room, based on
one of the lairs in the world. They'll be

00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:59.110
live-streaming players and personalities from the
Hearthstone community going through that escape

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.613
room on December 5th, at 4:30pm Pacific time, at
twitch.tv/playhearthstone, or

00:03:06.613 --> 00:03:12.215
youtube.com/hearthstone. Check it out to get to
vote on items to try and make their way through

00:03:12.215 --> 00:03:16.143
it. It's actually a community-interactive event.
Looks to be pretty cool, so definitely go check

00:03:16.143 --> 00:03:19.408
that out on December 5th. And then the expansion
on December 7th!

00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:23.664
TALIESIN: This is why I feel bad in not reading
the announcements, now. That sounds like fun!

00:03:23.664 --> 00:03:30.379
LAURA: It's all a surprise for us. Oh, I have an
announcement! Wait, but I don't think I have it

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:31.541
with me!

00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:33.339
TALIESIN: Wait, is it this?

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:36.807
LAURA: It is that! Okay. I'm ready.

00:03:36.807 --> 00:03:38.286
MATT: All right, go for it.

00:03:38.286 --> 00:03:46.611
LAURA: Okay, it's my turn? Da da-da da! We have
new merch in the store now! We've been waiting on

00:03:46.611 --> 00:03:54.320
these ones for so long, and they're finally here!
It's so beautiful. This is the artwork that's on

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.773
my save screen on my phone. It's been that way for
a long-- me and Ashley both. We're in love with

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:06.381
this art. It's got pages so you can take all your
personal D&amp;D notes in here. That's why we did it.

00:04:06.381 --> 00:04:12.730
And it goes with our pencil set, so you can have,
you know. You can have one, Jen, if you want!

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.694
TALIESIN: You can make your own art book.

00:04:14.694 --> 00:04:19.289
LAURA: So yeah, go check it out! It's in the store
now!

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:28.007
MATT: Awesome. Thank you, Laura. Also, cool note.
The third issue of Critical Role - Vox Machina:

00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:35.331
Origins comic is available. It's getting more and
more intense as each issue goes along. Check it

00:04:35.331 --> 00:04:40.597
out if you haven't had a chance. It's on
Comixology, digital.darkhorse.com, and wherever

00:04:40.597 --> 00:04:46.268
else you can find digital comics online. It's
pretty radical. Me and Liam, who have read the

00:04:46.268 --> 00:04:51.033
scripts and given notes on the scripts for future
issues, this is getting better and better as it

00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:52.620
goes.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.271
TRAVIS: Kings of the kingdom! We don't even know,
but you do!

00:04:56.271 --> 00:05:01.174
LIAM: Three just came out. I just read five, and
it is so baller. Oh my god.

00:05:01.174 --> 00:05:09.080
MATT: Be patient with the rest of them, Taliesin.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:21.391
LIAM: Also, to rewind, that beautiful art on that
book is by @NatRoze. Roze with a Z. Made that ages

00:05:21.391 --> 00:05:23.744
ago, and Laura's been in love with it for ages.

00:05:23.744 --> 00:05:28.223
LAURA: Yes, and so we had to put it on a notebook.
And doesn't it look so perfect? It's so perfect.

00:05:28.223 --> 00:05:30.589
And by the way, it's the Feywild!

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:37.585
TALIESIN: I'm very excited. I was not aware this
was coming down the pipe.

00:05:37.585 --> 00:05:40.388
LAURA: Yeah, and it's shiny. I don't know if you
can see it, but there's a little shimmer.

00:05:40.388 --> 00:05:45.982
TALIESIN: Thanks to the art book, I know what this
is called. It's called spot gloss. Thanks to the

00:05:45.982 --> 00:05:48.420
art book, I know it's got a spot gloss cover.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.771
LIAM: That is one shiny bear ass.

00:05:50.771 --> 00:05:54.568
TALIESIN: You can rub it for luck.

00:05:54.568 --> 00:05:57.186
LAURA: If you're so inclined.

00:05:57.186 --> 00:06:02.439
MATT: So you are all here tonight to witness
somebody in a very, completely honest way, shout

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:11.846
excitedly, "And it's in the Feywild!" And I love
that that is a thing that happened. Couple other

00:06:11.846 --> 00:06:18.551
quick announcements so we can get into the game. I
will be at Paradise City Comic Con in Miami,

00:06:18.551 --> 00:06:23.399
January 12th to 14th. All of you folks out there,
east coast Florida. I'm visiting my old stomping

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:30.277
grounds where I originally grew up. Check me out
there. Also, later in 2018, I'll be at Otafest in

00:06:30.277 --> 00:06:35.283
Calgary, May 18th to 20th, and A-Kon in Texas,
June 7th through the 10th. Early announcement for

00:06:35.283 --> 00:06:38.958
those dates, but that way if you want to come and
say hi, you can mark it in your calendar.

00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:46.230
TRAVIS: We're at SacAnime, January 5th or 6th or
something. It's the first week of January. We

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.744
hated missing when Sam and Liam went.

00:06:48.744 --> 00:06:51.147
LAURA: We love SacAnime. It's great.

00:06:51.147 --> 00:06:56.883
JENNIFER: I got to hang with you guys at SacAnime
a few years ago. We did an interview. It was so

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:58.344
fun!

00:06:58.344 --> 00:07:04.319
LIAM: We tried to get you to talk about killing
your friends and you would not do it. Why won't

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.177
you kill your friends? What's the matter with
you?

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:12.420
JENNIFER: Tonight I will.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.418
MATT: No, you're supposed to collaborate, but
we'll see how it goes. Did a new episode of

00:07:17.418 --> 00:07:19.098
Madness go up?

00:07:19.098 --> 00:07:27.596
LIAM: New episode of Madness came out! We have
this guy to show. Oh! This is the shirt for Sagas

00:07:27.596 --> 00:07:33.514
of Sundry: Madness. I am a Jenga pro! If you want
to learn how to play Jenga, you must watch Sagas

00:07:33.514 --> 00:07:37.920
of Sundry: Madness. This eye glows in the fucking
dark.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.569
JENNIFER: Let me see!

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:44.190
MATT: I like the idea that the Jenga catchphrase
from Critical Role was preparation for you to

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.551
actually be a Jenga master.

00:07:45.551 --> 00:07:47.584
LIAM: I surprise myself, let me tell you!

00:07:47.584 --> 00:07:50.352
TALIESIN: We loved our Dread shirts and were like,
it's a shame they don't glow! And they were like,

00:07:50.352 --> 00:07:52.067
next time. And we're like, man!

00:07:52.067 --> 00:07:55.339
LIAM: I think this is Ivan van Norman's eye. I
hope it's his eye.

00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:56.586
MATT: It looks about right.

00:07:56.586 --> 00:07:59.914
TALIESIN: It's the door of the house, right?

00:07:59.914 --> 00:08:14.582
MATT: Some eldritch horrors are more horrible than
others. All right, guys. Happy to be back. We

00:08:14.582 --> 00:08:19.862
missed you. Sorry for the chaos. Bringing it down,
we finished our announcements. That means tonight,

00:08:19.862 --> 00:08:27.097
we step into the world of Azeroth as we prepare
for tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:08:27.097 --> 00:09:59.389
[dramatic music]

00:09:59.389 --> 00:10:08.939
MATT: And welcome back. So, as we bring ourselves
into this story-- I missed you guys.

00:10:08.939 --> 00:10:11.399
JENNIFER: It's their fault!

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:28.581
MATT: It's okay. The Burning Legion has returned.
The world-conquering armies of the corrupt titan,

00:10:28.581 --> 00:10:36.956
Sargeras, have assaulted Azeroth. The greatest
heroes of both the Alliance and the Horde have

00:10:36.956 --> 00:10:42.711
gathered their resources to combat this
apocalyptic scourge. Traveling off to the Broken

00:10:42.711 --> 00:10:49.684
Isles and to Argus beyond to fight for the
salvation of Azeroth, these heroes will be the

00:10:49.684 --> 00:10:55.192
stuff of legend. While they're away, things are a
little slow down here in the Eastern Kingdoms for

00:10:55.192 --> 00:11:06.347
you guys, as a band of friends seeking to make a
name for yourselves. The streets of Ironforge grow

00:11:06.347 --> 00:11:12.010
dull with fetch quests and baking runs. Gilneas'
biggest torment is a terrible flea infestation.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:17.323
After Stormwind holds a pet-racing contest, which
you each individually lose, you gather your

00:11:17.323 --> 00:11:23.701
frustration and head east in search of real
adventure, trudging through a mire of

00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:29.161
uninteresting quests and aid to local farm-hands
and wandering merchants. You've all amassed some

00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:34.688
equipment to aid you for the new challenges ahead.
Although the patchwork sources leave your gear

00:11:34.688 --> 00:11:40.862
somewhat mismatched in color and make. Bundle, you
in particular seem to take pride in your

00:11:40.862 --> 00:11:44.583
lime-green robes that you were assured carried a
powerful enchantment.

00:11:44.583 --> 00:11:49.161
TALIESIN: It's from a boutique!

00:11:49.161 --> 00:11:55.082
MATT: Your troupe has now found your way to the
valley of the Red Ridge Mountains seeking solid

00:11:55.082 --> 00:12:00.943
work, only to find the work boards empty and the
wild beasts that roam the surrounding landscape

00:12:00.943 --> 00:12:06.304
well in the hands of the local guard. You all sit
within the Lakeshire Inn, within the village of

00:12:06.304 --> 00:12:12.899
Lakeshire, two cups into your woes as you lament
your life choices and clashing attire. The warm

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:17.526
interior is rather vacant outside of your band,
the hearth empty with naught but a smoldering log

00:12:17.526 --> 00:12:24.057
to combat the chill morning air. That's right,
you're two cups in &lt;i&gt;for breakfast&lt;/i&gt;. The innkeeper,

00:12:24.057 --> 00:12:29.564
Brianna, yawns and leaves as the bartender, of
fiery-orange, shoulder-length hair and mustache,

00:12:29.564 --> 00:12:33.464
walks over to deliver your next round of breakfast
drinks.

00:12:33.464 --> 00:12:48.770
LAURA: Sure is chilly in this place, huh? Woo!
Maybe you can add another log, there?

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.550
MATT: "Over here, in the fireplace?"

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.425
LAURA: Yeah, in that hearth.

00:12:53.425 --> 00:12:54.721
MATT: "I'll throw one on. Okay."

00:12:54.721 --> 00:12:55.916
LAURA: Thanks!

00:12:55.916 --> 00:12:58.143
MATT: "Let me know if you want another round."

00:12:58.143 --> 00:13:03.005
LIAM: This is a little weak. Do you have anything
stronger than this?

00:13:03.005 --> 00:13:06.000
MATT: "I can go look, but I got to do the log
thing first."

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.217
LIAM: All right. Log, then grog, yes?

00:13:09.217 --> 00:13:14.549
TALIESIN: If you have a menu of breakfast beers,
that would be most gracious.

00:13:14.549 --> 00:13:21.988
MATT: "All right." He looks a bit scattered but
goes off to put the log in the hearth. So, as we

00:13:21.988 --> 00:13:26.004
go around the table, if you wouldn't mind taking a
moment to describe your character as you appear at

00:13:26.004 --> 00:13:27.484
the table.

00:13:27.484 --> 00:13:36.070
TRAVIS: Yes! I am Lohkor Windfallow, paladin.
Keeper of virtues and righteousness. I am

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:43.723
devilishly handsome, and I don't play well with
others because of that devilish handsomeness. But

00:13:43.723 --> 00:13:50.298
my skills are always for sale and my fellows seem
to appreciate my roguish good looks.

00:13:50.298 --> 00:14:04.695
LAURA: You are quite handsome. Oh, hi! My name is
Greldamine Clypsol. I'm a gnome mage. I am short,

00:14:04.695 --> 00:14:13.247
even for a gnome; I know. That's fine. I wear my
hair in a high bun. It's brown. I'm just the

00:14:13.247 --> 00:14:19.888
biggest fan of Jaina Proudmore. I think she's just
the most amazing mage I've ever seen, you know. I

00:14:19.888 --> 00:14:24.289
hear good things about her. She's so powerful
and beautiful. Sounds amazing, I hear. I don't

00:14:24.289 --> 00:14:27.228
know, I haven't met her in person.

00:14:27.228 --> 00:14:40.486
TALIESIN: I have to catch my breath. Okay. My name
is Bundle. I'm a dwarf. I've got a very, very nice

00:14:40.486 --> 00:14:42.311
lime green robe.

00:14:42.311 --> 00:14:43.489
LAURA: It's beautiful.

00:14:43.489 --> 00:14:48.206
TALIESIN: Thank you, I'm very proud. I'm a priest
and I've been studying for quite some time.

00:14:48.206 --> 00:14:54.339
Learning my trade, perfecting it. I'm a bit
behind. I mean, I've got some younger brothers

00:14:54.339 --> 00:14:58.087
that are doing much better than I am, and
certainly they're succeeding more and going

00:14:58.087 --> 00:15:07.095
further, and that's fine. I'm doing my best. I'm
taking my own pace. Going a bit bald and I'm

00:15:07.095 --> 00:15:13.338
trying to do my best to bring it over, and it's
going into a-- it's not a great beard, but I use

00:15:13.338 --> 00:15:16.488
the ham hocks to liven it up a bit.

00:15:16.488 --> 00:15:18.646
TRAVIS: It's good. No, it frames your face very
well.

00:15:18.646 --> 00:15:27.493
TALIESIN: And I feel like I'm making my way at my
own pace very well. More beer.

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:35.114
JENNIFER: I'm Aerwin Whiteclaw. It's been quite a
long time since I've been in this much company.

00:15:35.114 --> 00:15:41.196
It's rather overwhelming. I am a night elf of the
rogue persuasion. I come from a long line of

00:15:41.196 --> 00:15:47.058
rogues. I attempted to be rather more of a
businessperson and healer, but was quickly dragged

00:15:47.058 --> 00:15:53.229
into the family business. I spend large amounts of
time alone, in the dark, by myself. I dress in

00:15:53.229 --> 00:15:54.889
black. I prefer it that way.

00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:57.312
(laughter)

00:15:57.312 --> 00:15:59.746
TRAVIS: No reason to spend all that time by
yourself.

00:15:59.746 --> 00:16:01.251
JENNIFER: Ready for another drink.

00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:03.541
(laughter)

00:16:03.541 --> 00:16:08.498
LIAM: Yes, my name is Quazirat Toluus.

00:16:08.498 --> 00:16:10.932
LAURA: Quazirat &lt;i&gt;Toes&lt;/i&gt;?

00:16:10.932 --> 00:16:13.343
LIAM: Quazirat &lt;i&gt;Toluus&lt;/i&gt;.

00:16:13.343 --> 00:16:14.855
TALIESIN: All ten of them?

00:16:14.855 --> 00:16:23.693
LIAM: All ten, yes. I am Draenei, wear all white
at all times, top and bottom, underneath and

00:16:23.693 --> 00:16:34.491
front. Whole nine yards. I am simple man. I like
to test myself in battle for the glory of Argus.

00:16:34.491 --> 00:16:43.939
Every day of my life for the glory of Argus. I
also like to sample the fine spirits of the realm,

00:16:43.939 --> 00:16:53.962
and I am a big player of MMORPGs. I like to unwind
at night when I am done killing the Burning

00:16:53.962 --> 00:16:55.459
Legion.

00:16:55.459 --> 00:16:57.314
LAURA: What's your handle?

00:16:57.314 --> 00:17:03.122
LIAM: It is LRJenkins1234.

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:07.286
LAURA: Creative. I like it.

00:17:07.286 --> 00:17:16.637
MATT: At this point, the bartender comes by this
time with the next round of drinks. The one log he

00:17:16.637 --> 00:17:20.202
placed in there is starting to catch a little bit,
but it's cold enough in the morning where it's

00:17:20.202 --> 00:17:24.902
taken a little while. The smoke's billowing up,
bit of it dribbling past the top of the fireplace

00:17:24.902 --> 00:17:30.821
and hitting, what you can see, is a casual stain
of gray that reaches the roof of the interior of

00:17:30.821 --> 00:17:37.153
the tavern above it. As he sets it down, he goes,
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop. But based

00:17:37.153 --> 00:17:44.146
"on your conversation and attire, I can see that
you seem to be aspiring problem solvers. Is that

00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:45.540
"right?"

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.992
TRAVIS: I guess so, that &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; describe us,
doesn't it?

00:17:46.992 --> 00:17:48.750
JENNIFER: I suppose.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:56.062
MATT: "Wonderful. Well, I'm the bartender here.
And my name is Wental. I happen to have a problem

00:17:56.062 --> 00:18:03.467
"that's in need of saving, friends, and solving.
You see this inn, it's been in my family for

00:18:03.467 --> 00:18:11.182
"generations, left to me by my late father. And
while it does keep me busy," and he looks around

00:18:11.182 --> 00:18:19.882
to a very empty tavern around you, "extremely busy,
my passions lie elsewhere. My hobby, my greatest

00:18:19.882 --> 00:18:23.541
"of loves, is being a smear monger."

00:18:23.541 --> 00:18:25.587
TRAVIS: A what?

00:18:25.587 --> 00:18:29.301
MATT: "A smear monger."

00:18:29.301 --> 00:18:31.111
LAURA: That sounds great.

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:33.064
MATT: "A smear monger, a chandler, crafter of
light."

00:18:33.064 --> 00:18:34.436
LAURA: Of course!

00:18:34.436 --> 00:18:36.057
MATT: "A candlemaker!"

00:18:36.057 --> 00:18:37.619
TRAVIS, LAURA, TALIESIN: Oh!

00:18:37.619 --> 00:18:40.451
LAURA: What kind of candles?

00:18:40.451 --> 00:18:44.951
MATT: "Oh, all kinds of candles: scented,
colorful, sizes, long wicks, short wicks."

00:18:44.951 --> 00:18:47.438
TRAVIS: Explosive?

00:18:47.438 --> 00:18:49.736
MATT: "No, but I haven't dabbled, either."

00:18:49.736 --> 00:18:50.999
JENNIFER: Any black ones?

00:18:50.999 --> 00:18:57.530
MATT: "Ah, that'll bring us to the crux of our
conversation. There &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt;. I've been hoarding all

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:02.615
"of the oils and fats from the kitchen since I was
a boy, slowly learning to build a stock and keep

00:19:02.615 --> 00:19:07.859
"it beneath my bed, and eventually moving it to a
shed offsite. Reading what books I can in secret.

00:19:07.859 --> 00:19:14.329
"If my father knew my interests in candle making...
anyway." And you can see his eyes begin to well up

00:19:14.329 --> 00:19:22.502
a bit and his hands are shaking. "I went to go to
my storage shed after buying a small homestead in

00:19:22.502 --> 00:19:30.282
"Goldshire and hoping to open a shop at some point
in the future. It's all gone. All of it! Just

00:19:30.282 --> 00:19:36.775
"gone! Every. Single. Candle I've made! Gone!"

00:19:36.775 --> 00:19:40.753
LAURA: Even your fat stores?

00:19:40.753 --> 00:19:47.198
MATT: "Well the fat stores are normally stored in
there, but they've gone bad since. I asked for it

00:19:47.198 --> 00:19:50.897
"to be investigated, but the guard laughed at me.
They have no appreciation for fine candlework."

00:19:50.897 --> 00:19:56.553
You notice, across the room, one of the other
women who are in there who's the local voyeur

00:19:56.553 --> 00:20:01.931
chuckles under her breath and she eats her cold
toast and stays at the table. Wental shoots her an

00:20:01.931 --> 00:20:09.200
icy dagger glance and back to you. "I ask, if you
would help retrieve my life's work, I would

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:18.190
"greatly make it worth your while. I have my
savings, which isn't much, about 520 gold pieces.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:23.397
"And I could probably muster some armor that
matches."

00:20:23.397 --> 00:20:24.976
LAURA: That'd be great!

00:20:24.976 --> 00:20:26.498
MATT: "What do you say?"

00:20:26.498 --> 00:20:27.764
LAURA: Do you have robes?

00:20:27.764 --> 00:20:29.175
MATT: "That could be arranged."

00:20:29.175 --> 00:20:30.588
TALIESIN: Doesn't have to match.

00:20:30.588 --> 00:20:35.845
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we should present a united
front, though. I mean, people should be able to

00:20:35.845 --> 00:20:37.440
see that we are a group.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.206
JENNIFER: As long as it's black.

00:20:39.206 --> 00:20:40.763
LIAM: As long as it's white.

00:20:40.763 --> 00:20:43.459
TALIESIN: As long as it's lime green.

00:20:43.459 --> 00:20:45.206
LAURA: I'm partial to purple.

00:20:45.206 --> 00:20:51.201
MATT: "I'll see what I can do about dye colors.
I'll have to send away, possibly to Westfall. They

00:20:51.201 --> 00:20:57.473
"have some good dyers there. But if you agree to
this, then the sooner we can get off the better!"

00:20:57.473 --> 00:21:03.075
And he twirls his mustache with both of his
fingers, a nervous tick or an exclamation of

00:21:03.075 --> 00:21:05.328
physicality. "Shall we?"

00:21:05.328 --> 00:21:07.561
JENNIFER: I'll agree as long as you never do that
again.

00:21:07.561 --> 00:21:09.672
MATT: "Very well."

00:21:09.672 --> 00:21:12.858
TALIESIN: There was a fisherman who did like 25 of
those little red plants, but this sounds better.

00:21:12.858 --> 00:21:19.004
LAURA: This sounds fun! Wental, you can count on
us! I jump on top of the table and raise my fist

00:21:19.004 --> 00:21:20.819
into the air.

00:21:20.819 --> 00:21:22.459
JENNIFER: I shrink into my chair.

00:21:22.459 --> 00:21:25.096
MATT: He awkwardly reaches out and side fistbumps,
not sure what to do.

00:21:25.096 --> 00:21:26.839
LAURA: Candles!

00:21:26.839 --> 00:21:28.698
MATT: "I like her!"

00:21:28.698 --> 00:21:33.376
TRAVIS: I'm sure this morning's fare will be also
a part of our arrangement?

00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:35.384
MATT: "Sure."

00:21:35.384 --> 00:21:39.675
LIAM: And I was going to ask for a couple bottles
of your best vintage to be added to the agreed

00:21:39.675 --> 00:21:41.133
upon price.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:43.620
TRAVIS and JENNIFER: Yes.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:48.517
MATT: "Very well. I'll be happy to place it upon
your tab that will be wiped clean upon the

00:21:48.517 --> 00:21:50.356
"retrieval of my candles."

00:21:50.356 --> 00:21:52.912
JENNIFER: A steed or two. I saw something out back
that looked rather suitable.

00:21:52.912 --> 00:22:01.803
MATT: "I'll see what I can do. I only have so much
I can do in the town, but let me try. Anyway." And

00:22:01.803 --> 00:22:07.274
he rushes off. He comes back and he brings you two
bottles of wine, not the greatest. You don't get a

00:22:07.274 --> 00:22:12.305
lot of decent import over here on Lakeshore,
unfortunately. It's a little out of the way.

00:22:12.305 --> 00:22:13.973
LIAM: Will it mess me up?

00:22:13.973 --> 00:22:16.822
MATT: "If you were to chug it now, most likely!"

00:22:16.822 --> 00:22:18.638
LIAM: That's a deal.

00:22:18.638 --> 00:22:22.567
MATT: "All righty. Follow me. I'll take you to the
shed. See if you can learn anything."

00:22:22.567 --> 00:22:24.214
LAURA: Great.

00:22:24.214 --> 00:22:33.856
MATT: So Wental guides you outside the Lakeshore
Inn, around the back and up past some bushes.

00:22:33.856 --> 00:22:37.809
There's a number of trees that crest right against
the base of the Red Ridge Mountains, just above

00:22:37.809 --> 00:22:42.637
the location of the inn. As he comes around, you
can see there's the one stable off to the side. He

00:22:42.637 --> 00:22:49.741
goes, "I'll talk to them and see what I can do.
But to be honest, the stable master and me don't

00:22:49.741 --> 00:22:51.510
"really get along."

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:54.270
JENNIFER: Just show me where he is. I'm sure we
can work something out.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:23:01.436
MATT: "Very well. Should I take you to the shed
first, or do you need your steed now?"

00:23:01.436 --> 00:23:03.599
LAURA: Maybe to the shed since it's close.

00:23:03.599 --> 00:23:07.641
JENNIFER: We can go to the shed. I don't want to
make the small one run.

00:23:07.641 --> 00:23:11.475
LAURA: Thank you.

00:23:11.475 --> 00:23:14.500
MATT: "I don't mind. All right." And you see he
seems to have confidence around the gnome. And

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.279
then he gets really sheepish in the gaze of the
night elf who stares down and probably stands a

00:23:18.279 --> 00:23:26.289
good six inches taller than him. So he leads you
up past this section to the base of the mountains

00:23:26.289 --> 00:23:31.605
and you can see there's a really nice-looking shed
that's settled between the edge of the mountains

00:23:31.605 --> 00:23:36.416
and a tree over there. It's closed, it's locked
up, there's chains. But as you walk up, you can

00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:40.147
see that the actual lock has been broken and the
chains dangle off to the sides of the two doors

00:23:40.147 --> 00:23:42.333
that open up into it.

00:23:42.333 --> 00:23:45.385
TALIESIN: There's your trouble. You left it
unlocked.

00:23:45.385 --> 00:23:48.498
TRAVIS: I think someone broke the lock.

00:23:48.498 --> 00:23:54.626
TALIESIN: You're making assumptions, I feel.
That's a lot to just assume, just taking your

00:23:54.626 --> 00:23:56.096
first look.

00:23:56.096 --> 00:23:59.870
MATT: (squeak) He opens the front doors to the
shed and upon looking inside, you can see there

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:06.697
are shelves arranged. There are small crates that
have been pried open. Across the entirety of the

00:24:06.697 --> 00:24:12.729
floor you see scraps of wax scattered here and
there, large spaces where apparently clusters of

00:24:12.729 --> 00:24:18.499
it were set and have since been pulled. And it is
entirely empty and scraped of any possible

00:24:18.499 --> 00:24:24.746
remainder of wax. And there's a sudden smell that
comes out, too. It could be a combination of

00:24:24.746 --> 00:24:32.949
either rotting animal bits and/or some element of
fecal matter. It's hard to really pick out. But

00:24:32.949 --> 00:24:34.522
it's not a pleasant interior.

00:24:34.522 --> 00:24:41.016
LIAM: Are there any markings, footprints,
different toe patterns, any kind of clues?

00:24:41.016 --> 00:24:45.989
MATT: "I looked everywhere and saw nothing. I'm
also a bartender and that's why I asked you guys.

00:24:45.989 --> 00:24:48.189
"So if you want to have a look, please!"

00:24:48.189 --> 00:24:51.517
LIAM: Yeah. I was actually asking the DM.

00:24:51.517 --> 00:24:54.869
MATT: Oh, okay.

00:24:54.869 --> 00:24:59.915
LIAM: Do I see, with my Draenei eyes, as I stroke
my chin tentacles--

00:24:59.915 --> 00:25:05.164
LAURA: You have tentacles?! You have tentacles on
your chin?

00:25:05.164 --> 00:25:08.235
LIAM: On my chin. I don't like to draw attention
to them.

00:25:08.235 --> 00:25:12.199
TRAVIS: You don't need to. They're just there.

00:25:12.199 --> 00:25:17.868
MATT: So are you getting to the ground?

00:25:17.868 --> 00:25:19.235
LIAM: That's right.

00:25:19.235 --> 00:25:20.843
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:25:20.843 --> 00:25:28.912
LIAM: Yes. I'm making an investigation check. I'm
rolling a d20. That's not very good. That is, hold

00:25:28.912 --> 00:25:32.009
on! I've just solved the entire game. That's a
two.

00:25:32.009 --> 00:25:36.444
MATT: You get close to the ground and there's a
lot of small bits of wax. And you start pulling

00:25:36.444 --> 00:25:40.623
them together and piecing them, and you figure if
you spend the next couple hours, you can maybe put

00:25:40.623 --> 00:25:42.674
together a very small candle.

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:44.470
LIAM: There were candles here.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.246
MATT: You are correct.

00:25:46.246 --> 00:25:50.533
TRAVIS: Quazi, you are astute, as always. Bundle,
would you mind checking the lock to see if

00:25:50.533 --> 00:25:51.950
there's--?

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.399
TALIESIN: I take a look at the lock.

00:25:54.399 --> 00:25:55.944
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:25:55.944 --> 00:25:58.602
TALIESIN: Oh, boy. Oh, wow.

00:25:58.602 --> 00:26:01.996
TRAVIS: Oh, no. It's cold in here.

00:26:01.996 --> 00:26:05.755
LAURA: Warm it up, guys!

00:26:05.755 --> 00:26:07.119
TALIESIN: Seven?

00:26:07.119 --> 00:26:12.435
MATT: Seven? The lock appears to have been broken
through blunt force, but you have no other

00:26:12.435 --> 00:26:14.518
information you can draw from it.

00:26:14.518 --> 00:26:18.961
TALIESIN: Lock appears to have been broken by
blunt force. I don't know.

00:26:18.961 --> 00:26:20.870
JENNIFER: Let me have a look.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.012
MATT: All right, if you want to go ahead and make
an investigation check as well.

00:26:23.012 --> 00:26:33.073
LIAM: That's a good idea. Okay, that's better than
us. So you go from there to there, and add that.

00:26:33.073 --> 00:26:35.479
JENNIFER: So it's 13.

00:26:35.479 --> 00:26:41.647
MATT: 13? So as you start glancing around, first
things first. When you get closer to the ground

00:26:41.647 --> 00:26:48.390
and elements of the doorway, you can smell in the
air, it's almost like a wet fur scent in the air.

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:53.371
And as you glance towards the edge of the shed's
opening in the mud and dirt that surrounds the

00:26:53.371 --> 00:26:59.911
exterior, you can see faint foot tracks smattering
in different directions. Many of them. There's

00:26:59.911 --> 00:27:06.745
multiple sets. Soled shoes, or boots of some kind.
But it looks almost like there's also a toe or two

00:27:06.745 --> 00:27:15.470
protruding from the front. Smaller than a man's
feet. They lead away from the shed and then

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:19.349
further up the mountain range to the westward
direction.

00:27:19.349 --> 00:27:28.193
JENNIFER: I've seen these before. It's been a long
time. It was very far from here. I hesitate to

00:27:28.193 --> 00:27:34.206
name it. I'll leave that to the Dungeon Master.
It's my first game!

00:27:34.206 --> 00:27:41.979
LIAM: You can also tell there were candles here,
yes?

00:27:41.979 --> 00:27:45.141
JENNIFER: Yes. I can smell there were candles
here.

00:27:45.141 --> 00:27:51.537
MATT: So, go ahead and roll a d20 and add your
intelligence modifier to this one. So, look at

00:27:51.537 --> 00:27:54.623
your intelligence. Liam, want to help her with the
intelligence modifier?

00:27:54.623 --> 00:27:57.089
LIAM: Intelligence modifier is up here, yeah? Five
plus--

00:27:57.089 --> 00:27:58.305
JENNIFER: So, 13.

00:27:58.305 --> 00:27:59.960
MATT: That's a saving throw.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.448
LIAM: Oh, so intelligence check, you say?
Intelligence check? Well, then it's just that

00:28:04.448 --> 00:28:08.569
plus-- where the hell is it? There it is.

00:28:08.569 --> 00:28:09.997
JENNIFER: Ten!

00:28:09.997 --> 00:28:16.193
MATT: Ten? Okay. You recall seeing tracks like
this before but the name is on the tip of your

00:28:16.193 --> 00:28:18.026
tongue. You're not entirely certain what it could
be.

00:28:18.026 --> 00:28:20.665
JENNIFER: The name's on the tip of my tongue and I
can't quite grab it. Can someone else grab it for

00:28:20.665 --> 00:28:21.441
me?

00:28:21.441 --> 00:28:23.765
TRAVIS: Yes. Let me see if I recognize these
tracks.

00:28:23.765 --> 00:28:30.479
LAURA: Does anyone know that you make candles?
Other than your father?

00:28:30.479 --> 00:28:34.421
MATT: "Well, he doesn't know yet. I was going to
open the store first and have him come take a look

00:28:34.421 --> 00:28:35.647
"at it."

00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:37.736
LAURA: Oh, okay. So you don't have any candle
enemies?

00:28:37.736 --> 00:28:42.195
MATT: "I don't believe so. Not in this town. There
isn't a candlemaker, not anymore."

00:28:42.195 --> 00:28:46.071
LAURA: And are your candles scented?

00:28:46.071 --> 00:28:47.602
MATT: "Some of them were."

00:28:47.602 --> 00:28:50.279
LAURA: Do most of them smell like animal fat?

00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:57.145
MATT: "Yes, they do, by their very nature. But I
try best to add lavender to the batch and

00:28:57.145 --> 00:28:58.910
"occasionally--"

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:00.320
JENNIFER: Lavender, you say?

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.457
MATT: "Yes, lavender."

00:29:01.457 --> 00:29:03.352
LIAM: What about paht-pourri?

00:29:03.352 --> 00:29:07.477
TRAVIS: We've discussed this. It's &lt;i&gt;potpourri&lt;/i&gt;.

00:29:07.477 --> 00:29:09.115
LIAM: You're dropping off the T.

00:29:09.115 --> 00:29:11.847
TRAVIS: Well, it's just potpourri.

00:29:11.847 --> 00:29:13.310
LIAM: You're fucking with me.

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.008
TRAVIS: No, for the fourth time.

00:29:15.008 --> 00:29:17.514
LAURA: Were you going to track them?

00:29:17.514 --> 00:29:19.624
TRAVIS: I'd like to try.

00:29:19.624 --> 00:29:21.795
MATT: Make a survival check.

00:29:21.795 --> 00:29:23.520
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.627
LAURA: Is that with your Grog dice?

00:29:25.627 --> 00:29:27.351
TRAVIS: With my die!

00:29:27.351 --> 00:29:36.697
MATT: You watch as the armored human paladin gets
low. His eyes suddenly spark! As he looks to the

00:29:36.697 --> 00:29:40.798
left, looks to the right, looks down to the
ground, and, almost like a hound dog, begins

00:29:40.798 --> 00:29:46.876
trailing this track curving around the shed into
the west as you guys slowly follow suit.

00:29:46.876 --> 00:29:51.117
TALIESIN: This is why we pay him big gold bucks
right there.

00:29:51.117 --> 00:29:55.009
TRAVIS: And because I'm handsome.

00:29:55.009 --> 00:29:59.278
MATT: As you guys follow, Wental stays a few steps
behind. He seems excited, but also not sure what

00:29:59.278 --> 00:30:03.056
you guys are going to discover and you can see the
tension rising in him. His shoulders are slowly

00:30:03.056 --> 00:30:05.355
creeping up across the sides of his head.

00:30:05.355 --> 00:30:10.050
LAURA: Yes, we're clearly much more experienced
fighters than you are.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:19.168
MATT: "I completely agree. I hope." At this point
you catch up to your human paladin friend over

00:30:19.168 --> 00:30:25.901
there and you find the tracks lead up to a large
cluster of bushes that are embedded right in the

00:30:25.901 --> 00:30:36.758
base of the mountain range. They're thorny.
They're dry. It's a small bramble cluster. It's

00:30:36.758 --> 00:30:40.960
about five or so feet up. It's a wide chunk and
you can see bits and pieces of it scattered across

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:46.797
the edge of the mountain range here. As you get
closer you can see some of the jagged edges of the

00:30:46.797 --> 00:30:50.970
boosh have a faint-- A boosh. The boosh.

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:54.165
TRAVIS: Are you amused by the boosh?

00:30:54.165 --> 00:31:09.389
MATT: You find the boosh rather amusing. On the
jagged edges of the bush you see faint elements of

00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:13.149
a waxy residue that have been scraped onto some of
the thorns of the brambles.

00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:15.341
LIAM: Probably unrelated.

00:31:15.341 --> 00:31:21.537
MATT: Just beyond you can barely see a dark
recess, about four feet tall and about four feet

00:31:21.537 --> 00:31:24.514
wide, behind the bush, that presses into the
mountain range.

00:31:24.514 --> 00:31:31.676
TRAVIS: The tracks lead to this bush. If you see
just beyond there's a recess in the mountains.

00:31:31.676 --> 00:31:33.517
LAURA: How big is the recess?

00:31:33.517 --> 00:31:36.676
TRAVIS: It's like four-- what is it? How far
about?

00:31:36.676 --> 00:31:40.712
MATT: Four foot wide and four foot tall.

00:31:40.712 --> 00:31:44.248
LAURA: Oh. That's small for a human.

00:31:44.248 --> 00:31:46.106
TRAVIS: Indeed it is.

00:31:46.106 --> 00:31:50.728
LAURA: So I wonder if these creatures who stole
the candles are smaller than humans.

00:31:50.728 --> 00:31:55.023
TRAVIS: My hypothesis exactly.

00:31:55.023 --> 00:31:57.783
TALIESIN: Or they're prone to crawling.

00:31:57.783 --> 00:31:59.087
LAURA: Oh, or that.

00:31:59.087 --> 00:32:02.939
TALIESIN: They could be crawlers. That's some mean
crawlers.

00:32:02.939 --> 00:32:08.357
JENNIFER: Gren-- Grel-- Greldamin?

00:32:08.357 --> 00:32:14.759
LAURA: Greldamine. It's okay, it's a hard name.
Especially for elves.

00:32:14.759 --> 00:32:21.255
(laughter)

00:32:21.255 --> 00:32:23.878
JENNIFER: It looks like you could stand upright in
that hole.

00:32:23.878 --> 00:32:26.135
LAURA: I could.

00:32:26.135 --> 00:32:31.448
JENNIFER: Yes. It's another element we should
factor into our search.

00:32:31.448 --> 00:32:35.472
LAURA: Should I go in? Should we all go in?

00:32:35.472 --> 00:32:37.016
LIAM: You first, little one.

00:32:37.016 --> 00:32:40.653
LAURA: Gladly. Can we move these thorny bushes out
of the way though?

00:32:40.653 --> 00:32:44.459
TRAVIS: Absolutely. I start ripping the dried
brush out of the--

00:32:44.459 --> 00:32:48.183
MATT: The brush is actually not attached to the
ground. It comes and pulls out of the way really

00:32:48.183 --> 00:32:49.445
easily.

00:32:49.445 --> 00:32:51.320
JENNIFER: Does he fall on his butt when he pulls
on it that hard?

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.449
MATT: He almost does. He teeters on one foot as
his sheer show of strength to tear them out

00:32:55.449 --> 00:33:00.559
overcompensates and his armored self, being top
heavy as he is, he stands there and awkwardly

00:33:00.559 --> 00:33:08.808
wobbles in place. And for a moment you see as the
bartender, Wental, swallows deeply out of the

00:33:08.808 --> 00:33:11.040
choice of companions that he's hired for this.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.352
LAURA: Wental, are you coming with us?

00:33:12.352 --> 00:33:14.033
MATT: "Oh goodness no!"

00:33:14.033 --> 00:33:16.284
TRAVIS: Are you sure? We have extra daggers and
all sorts of things.

00:33:16.284 --> 00:33:23.014
MATT: "I have a job. It's busy. Lot of people in
there. I need to make drinks and breakfast. I

00:33:23.014 --> 00:33:26.205
"hired you to do this for me. Please do this for
me."

00:33:26.205 --> 00:33:27.731
LAURA: Of course, yes, don't worry.

00:33:27.731 --> 00:33:30.588
TRAVIS: We will take care of this and be back
expediently. You can count on us!

00:33:30.588 --> 00:33:31.952
MATT: "Wonderful, thank you."

00:33:31.952 --> 00:33:33.284
JENNIFER: Please have dinner ready.

00:33:33.284 --> 00:33:40.548
MATT: "Yes ma'am." You can't tell if he's crushing
or legitimately super frightened but, "Good

00:33:40.548 --> 00:33:42.036
"luck!"

00:33:42.036 --> 00:33:43.576
JENNIFER: One and the same.

00:33:43.576 --> 00:33:49.397
MATT: So pulling the brush out of the way, you can
see this has been a deliberately-dug cavern that

00:33:49.397 --> 00:33:51.973
recedes into the mountain and into darkness.

00:33:51.973 --> 00:33:54.914
LAURA: Hello!

00:33:54.914 --> 00:33:59.197
MATT: (imitates echo) It does echo a bit.

00:33:59.197 --> 00:34:01.058
TRAVIS: Can you see in the dark?

00:34:01.058 --> 00:34:10.491
LAURA: Yes, but I also have Light! And I send
Light down the tunnel. Can I do that? Can I send

00:34:10.491 --> 00:34:12.956
Light down the tunnel or does it light up around
me?

00:34:12.956 --> 00:34:14.960
MATT: Well, you choose an object to then light up
like it was a torch.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.909
LAURA: Oh, what do we have on us?

00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:19.763
TRAVIS: I have a torch. I have ten of them.

00:34:19.763 --> 00:34:22.086
LAURA: Oh. Well we should probably just use a
torch then.

00:34:22.086 --> 00:34:24.068
LIAM: There's also rocks on the ground.

00:34:24.068 --> 00:34:29.382
LAURA: Oh! I'll pick up a rock and cast Light on
the rock! That was a good idea,

00:34:29.382 --> 00:34:31.073
Whatever-Your-Toes!

00:34:31.073 --> 00:34:38.106
LIAM: Yes. Is there room for our World of Warcraft
pauldrons to go into this space?

00:34:38.106 --> 00:34:44.113
MATT: Four foot wide? At your size? Barely. It
scrapes the edges as you push inward, digging two

00:34:44.113 --> 00:34:45.963
small grooves along the cavern.

00:34:45.963 --> 00:34:50.778
JENNIFER: Let's send him first. Someone push him
from behind.

00:34:50.778 --> 00:34:55.772
TALIESIN: Grease it up and he'll squeeze right in
there.

00:34:55.772 --> 00:34:57.241
JENNIFER: There's candle wax around.

00:34:57.241 --> 00:35:00.098
TALIESIN: Wax the corners and push him through.

00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:05.759
LIAM: Either the small magic one or the sneaky one
should be going first, I think, yes?

00:35:05.759 --> 00:35:08.268
JENNIFER: Well she can stand upright.

00:35:08.268 --> 00:35:09.530
LAURA: I'll go first.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.905
LIAM: All right little stinker, let's see what you
can do.

00:35:12.905 --> 00:35:15.957
MATT: All right, so Greldamine, as you light up
the rock in your hand and it's giving off this

00:35:15.957 --> 00:35:21.943
bright torch light, you hold it in front of you
and you walk right into it. As soon as you begin

00:35:21.943 --> 00:35:27.162
to step into the chamber you can already feel
there's a faint cold breeze blowing from the open

00:35:27.162 --> 00:35:33.762
world behind you into the chamber. You're drawn
deeper and deeper into the darkness within as it

00:35:33.762 --> 00:35:40.293
begins to faintly grade into a descent. What's the
order in which you guys are traveling behind her?

00:35:40.293 --> 00:35:42.624
LAURA: Oh jeez, this is so dumb that I'm in the
front.

00:35:42.624 --> 00:35:44.895
MATT and LAURA: What do you mean?

00:35:44.895 --> 00:35:48.256
LAURA: With my 37 hit points.

00:35:48.256 --> 00:35:50.654
TRAVIS: You're so squishy!

00:35:50.654 --> 00:35:52.134
TALIESIN: We're all a little squishy.

00:35:52.134 --> 00:35:54.136
TRAVIS: To make you feel better I will be second.

00:35:54.136 --> 00:35:55.139
LAURA: Okay.

00:35:55.139 --> 00:35:57.369
TALIESIN: I'll go right in the middle.

00:35:57.369 --> 00:36:01.516
JENNIFER: If you'd like a wall behind us, I'll go
after him.

00:36:01.516 --> 00:36:05.440
LIAM: All right. Dramamine, lead the way.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:14.985
MATT: As you continue delving deeper down this
cavern, the smell of damp earth seems to be ever

00:36:14.985 --> 00:36:19.294
present as a recent rainfall has left a lot of
this path, the early portion of it, rather muddy.

00:36:19.294 --> 00:36:25.148
Your feet slip and slick against the soft floor as
you occasionally have to right yourself against

00:36:25.148 --> 00:36:30.799
the walls of the cavern, being careful as you push
deeper into this. Now after some time the path

00:36:30.799 --> 00:36:36.571
comes to an abrupt halt where the floor seems to
drop down about five feet into a tunnel that opens

00:36:36.571 --> 00:36:40.224
larger and wider, 15 feet below you, deeper still
into the mountain.

00:36:40.224 --> 00:36:44.680
LAURA: Shh! Can I hear anything?

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:49.335
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:36:49.335 --> 00:36:54.899
LAURA: Ooh! 23.

00:36:54.899 --> 00:36:56.011
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:36:56.011 --> 00:37:03.334
MATT: What little bit of wind is passing through
down into the cavern, you can hear what sounds

00:37:03.334 --> 00:37:15.635
like a faint rock falling. Some scraping sounds
and a door slam, distant, below you, and distant.

00:37:15.635 --> 00:37:21.559
JENNIFER: Might this be a good time for some
shadow melding?

00:37:21.559 --> 00:37:23.247
LAURA: What is that?

00:37:23.247 --> 00:37:26.949
MATT: It's up to you. You can only use it once per
short rest so keep that in mind. If there's

00:37:26.949 --> 00:37:30.760
nothing currently around you can still stealth
whenever you want to.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.523
JENNIFER: I'm inclined to stealth.

00:37:32.523 --> 00:37:33.762
LAURA: Oh yeah, you can stealth.

00:37:33.762 --> 00:37:35.242
JENNIFER: I'm inclined to stealth.

00:37:35.242 --> 00:37:37.017
MATT: Okay, so yeah, go ahead and roll a stealth
check.

00:37:37.017 --> 00:37:38.639
JENNIFER: I'll be the stealth person. All right
so--

00:37:38.639 --> 00:37:40.317
LAURA: We can all try to stealth right now if you
want to.

00:37:40.317 --> 00:37:42.876
LIAM: It would be better because here's the thing,
even if you are supremely sneaky which you are,

00:37:42.876 --> 00:37:46.856
I'm fucking bullshit with sneaking so we all have
to, you know, pull our weight.

00:37:46.856 --> 00:37:50.771
LAURA: Maybe you'll roll a 20.

00:37:50.771 --> 00:37:56.091
LIAM: We'll see how I do. Three!

00:37:56.091 --> 00:37:59.830
JENNIFER: 28.

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:09.677
MATT: Your darker night elf complexion vanishes
into the shadows-- there you go. I love it.

00:38:09.677 --> 00:38:11.569
TALIESIN: 15.

00:38:11.569 --> 00:38:13.189
LAURA: 13.

00:38:13.189 --> 00:38:14.328
TRAVIS: 13 as well.

00:38:14.328 --> 00:38:15.997
LIAM: And I lied. Five.

00:38:15.997 --> 00:38:21.891
MATT: That makes a difference. All right so, as
you guys all quietly look down into this small

00:38:21.891 --> 00:38:26.048
cavern it drops down, you're looking over the
edge--

00:38:26.048 --> 00:38:27.326
LAURA: Like five feet?

00:38:27.326 --> 00:38:30.258
MATT: Like five, six feet down below you jump down
if you want to.

00:38:30.258 --> 00:38:31.832
LAURA: Should we jump down?

00:38:31.832 --> 00:38:33.074
LIAM: Yeah! They'll never see us coming!

00:38:33.074 --> 00:38:34.704
(shushing)

00:38:34.704 --> 00:38:40.743
JENNIFER: Put a sock in it. So I suppose I should
go ahead. I'm going to sneak ahead because I'm the

00:38:40.743 --> 00:38:42.879
sneaky one in this one. All right, I'm sneaking
ahead.

00:38:42.879 --> 00:38:45.973
MATT: As you guys all leap down into the tunnel
below you--

00:38:45.973 --> 00:38:49.595
JENNIFER: Oh, oh! (grunt)

00:38:49.595 --> 00:38:57.823
MATT: Okay. Said that, you all leap in afterward.
You go ahead and begin to sneak ahead a bit and it

00:38:57.823 --> 00:39:03.767
switches back a bit and goes into a much more
steady decline in the direction of where you came

00:39:03.767 --> 00:39:04.771
from below.

00:39:04.771 --> 00:39:06.168
JENNIFER: Is it slippery?

00:39:06.168 --> 00:39:07.864
MATT: It's actually much drier now. You're further
away from the cavern entrance, it looks like the

00:39:07.864 --> 00:39:09.090
water--

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:12.516
JENNIFER: It's much drier here. I'm going ahead. I
smell something. It's very familiar, but my

00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:17.853
intelligence is not as high as I'd like so I can't
remember what it is.

00:39:17.853 --> 00:39:20.408
TALIESIN: Lavender.

00:39:20.408 --> 00:39:21.546
LAURA: Ooh.

00:39:21.546 --> 00:39:23.317
JENNIFER: It smells like lavender. It does, good
reminder.

00:39:23.317 --> 00:39:24.418
LAURA: Does it?

00:39:24.418 --> 00:39:25.721
MATT: You don't smell lavender as well--

00:39:25.721 --> 00:39:27.870
TALIESIN: No? Never mind, that's just me being a
nuisance.

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:29.284
JENNIFER: I don't smell lavender, I take that
back.

00:39:29.284 --> 00:39:30.321
MATT: But you--

00:39:30.321 --> 00:39:32.144
JENNIFER: Stop it, I'm new.

00:39:32.144 --> 00:39:37.532
MATT: You do begin to hear as you begin your
approach what sounds like faint rushing water.

00:39:37.532 --> 00:39:39.827
JENNIFER: I hear rushing water.

00:39:39.827 --> 00:39:43.577
MATT: And you see ahead as you're pushing
forward-- are you guys following behind her?

00:39:43.577 --> 00:39:46.821
LAURA: Yeah, no, we're following, we're following.

00:39:46.821 --> 00:39:48.557
MATT: So like, hanging about 20 feet or so back?

00:39:48.557 --> 00:39:49.805
LAURA: Yeah.

00:39:49.805 --> 00:39:53.406
MATT: Eventually the path begins to curve to the
left and you can see a faint source of light that

00:39:53.406 --> 00:39:56.638
begins to emerge around the corner as you begin to
curve around.

00:39:56.638 --> 00:39:59.240
LAURA: (whispering) What does it look like?

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:06.907
JENNIFER: (whispering) It looks like a long thin
ray of light. Vertical, I think. I've been waiting

00:40:06.907 --> 00:40:08.509
to find out if I'm right.

00:40:08.509 --> 00:40:10.126
TRAVIS: Are you making this up?

00:40:10.126 --> 00:40:12.919
JENNIFER: I am, totally. Am I allowed? Am I
allowed to do that?

00:40:12.919 --> 00:40:14.078
LAURA: No!

00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:15.895
JENNIFER: Oh, I'll stop now. I don't know this
game yet.

00:40:15.895 --> 00:40:19.387
LIAM: What happens is he will create the
environment and the things around you and you

00:40:19.387 --> 00:40:22.088
interact with them and you roll dice occasionally.

00:40:22.088 --> 00:40:23.891
JENNIFER: I'm going to go under here for a
minute.

00:40:23.891 --> 00:40:29.494
LIAM: You're in control of your personality and
the actions you do in this world. He's the world.

00:40:29.494 --> 00:40:31.948
JENNIFER: I don't know, do I see any light?

00:40:31.948 --> 00:40:35.127
MATT: So as you coast around the corner go ahead
and make a perception check.

00:40:35.127 --> 00:40:36.595
JENNIFER: Okay.

00:40:36.595 --> 00:40:43.208
LIAM: There it is. Oh that's shnazzy. Yeah. What
is that?

00:40:43.208 --> 00:40:44.999
JENNIFER: (counting) 18.

00:40:44.999 --> 00:40:48.377
MATT: All right, so as you coast around the
corner, placing your hand along the edge of the

00:40:48.377 --> 00:40:55.310
cavern you glance over and you can see the hallway
opens up into a much larger chamber of natural

00:40:55.310 --> 00:41:03.536
stone formations and stalactites litter the roof
above you, the cavern top. There's about 20 feet

00:41:03.536 --> 00:41:07.822
beyond this entrance, an underground river that is
stretching across from one side to the other

00:41:07.822 --> 00:41:14.692
before diving in and vanishing beneath the rock
wall on the far right side. Crossing this small

00:41:14.692 --> 00:41:20.991
recess where the water seems to be rushing, you
can see the occasional mist and spray from wayward

00:41:20.991 --> 00:41:27.385
rocks that are breaking up the flow of the river.
Two rickety wood plank bridges that cross past it

00:41:27.385 --> 00:41:35.341
are attached and nailed into portions of the rock,
and then right across, you can see the source of

00:41:35.341 --> 00:41:40.786
light. There's a number of sources of light that
are slightly shifting on the opposite end of the

00:41:40.786 --> 00:41:47.486
chamber. There's another platform on the other end
of the river where you can see roughly nine nasty

00:41:47.486 --> 00:41:54.403
looking humanoid creatures that are clustered with
patches of fur on portions of their body. They

00:41:54.403 --> 00:42:01.581
carry satchels and packs. A single, melting lit
candle rests atop each of their heads as their

00:42:01.581 --> 00:42:04.563
light source in these dark tunnels.

00:42:04.563 --> 00:42:06.051
LAURA: That's really cute.

00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:09.644
MATT: You now recognize what was on the tip of
your tongue. These are definitely kobolds and they

00:42:09.644 --> 00:42:13.233
appear to have been coming through a door that is
now closed and being locked on the opposite side

00:42:13.233 --> 00:42:18.251
by one of them that is larger. They're carrying
these large sacks and they're all talking amongst

00:42:18.251 --> 00:42:22.968
each other. You can see their features are
somewhat rat-like and their protruded snouts,

00:42:22.968 --> 00:42:27.597
whiskers that shoot off to each side. They haven't
noticed your presence yet.

00:42:27.597 --> 00:42:29.991
LAURA: How tall are they?

00:42:29.991 --> 00:42:32.191
MATT: About three and a half, four feet?

00:42:32.191 --> 00:42:33.853
LAURA: So they're taller than I am.

00:42:33.853 --> 00:42:35.144
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:42:35.144 --> 00:42:36.719
LAURA: I put my rock out.

00:42:36.719 --> 00:42:39.677
MATT: Okay, so your light source vanishes.

00:42:39.677 --> 00:42:40.723
LAURA: Yeah.

00:42:40.723 --> 00:42:45.129
LIAM: And we've been trailing the elf, so--

00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:49.188
JENNIFER: Now we're in the clear, so I'm going to
step back.

00:42:49.188 --> 00:42:55.428
LAURA: What should we do? How many of them are
there?

00:42:55.428 --> 00:42:59.649
TALIESIN and JENNIFER: (counting) One, two, three,
four.

00:42:59.649 --> 00:43:01.412
TRAVIS: Nine.

00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:06.750
LAURA: Nine? There's about nine of them. Okay. Do
you think we could take nine of them?

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:08.202
JENNIFER: Yeah.

00:43:08.202 --> 00:43:09.613
TRAVIS: Of course.

00:43:09.613 --> 00:43:11.478
LAURA: Has anybody tried talking to kobolds
before?

00:43:11.478 --> 00:43:13.268
TRAVIS: I haven't.

00:43:13.268 --> 00:43:14.923
TALIESIN: I've never talked to one before.

00:43:14.923 --> 00:43:18.374
JENNIFER: If our mission is to bring the candles
home, what would happen to the candles if we took

00:43:18.374 --> 00:43:21.741
them out in a violent manner? Would they be
damaged, would that--

00:43:21.741 --> 00:43:24.219
TRAVIS: Did we ask how many candles were missing?
Boxes of them.

00:43:24.219 --> 00:43:26.027
LAURA: An entire shed's worth!

00:43:26.027 --> 00:43:34.894
LIAM: I think it was more than nine so like ten
candles. Eleven, probably. We'll find out if we

00:43:34.894 --> 00:43:35.831
kill them.

00:43:35.831 --> 00:43:39.671
LAURA: I wonder if these are actual candles or if
these are old candles and they stole his candles

00:43:39.671 --> 00:43:44.247
for new candles because the candles on their head
are wearing down, do you know what I mean?

00:43:44.247 --> 00:43:46.579
LIAM: You just said candles a lot of times.

00:43:46.579 --> 00:43:50.027
TRAVIS: Who's feeling particularly sneaky right
now?

00:43:50.027 --> 00:43:51.637
LAURA: I can be invisible.

00:43:51.637 --> 00:43:59.508
TRAVIS: That's right. Feel like journeying in a
little bit? Seeing what else you can see?

00:43:59.508 --> 00:44:05.611
LAURA: Sure. Sure! I cast Invisibility on myself.

00:44:05.611 --> 00:44:16.537
MATT: Okay. You watch as the outside of your
gnomish companion shimmers and then vanishes. You

00:44:16.537 --> 00:44:19.234
find yourself invisible and you step carefully.

00:44:19.234 --> 00:44:21.399
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to walk across the bridge
now.

00:44:21.399 --> 00:44:23.083
JENNIFER: We can still hear you.

00:44:23.083 --> 00:44:26.869
LAURA: Yeah. I'll be quiet once I get &lt;i&gt;towards&lt;/i&gt;
the bridge.

00:44:26.869 --> 00:44:30.404
TRAVIS: See if you can see any of the other
candles.

00:44:30.404 --> 00:44:35.742
LAURA: I walk towards one of the rickety bridges.

00:44:35.742 --> 00:44:39.907
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a stealth check with
advantage because you're invisible.

00:44:39.907 --> 00:44:47.475
LAURA: Ooh. Yeah. 22.

00:44:47.475 --> 00:44:52.743
MATT: Okay. As you carefully make your way over
towards the edge of the bridge you can see the

00:44:52.743 --> 00:44:58.573
water is about a foot and a half, two feet below
where the bridge is and it's not rushing super

00:44:58.573 --> 00:45:03.269
fast but enough where it's breaking the water a
bit, you're seeing a bit of spray and mist and you

00:45:03.269 --> 00:45:10.206
see these nine kobold creatures across the way. It
looks like the one that was locking the door is

00:45:10.206 --> 00:45:14.213
currently talking and giving instructions to the
others as you see the larger one is standing there

00:45:14.213 --> 00:45:20.887
with this massive pack on his back that's filled
to the brim. All of them are carrying pickaxes to

00:45:20.887 --> 00:45:27.435
the side, but he has the wicked, more strongly
built one. As he's pointing to them he's talking.

00:45:27.435 --> 00:45:31.187
Make a perception check.

00:45:31.187 --> 00:45:33.187
LAURA: Oh, natural 20! Ha!

00:45:33.187 --> 00:45:34.529
MATT: Nice.

00:45:34.529 --> 00:45:38.947
So you can hear faintly what he's
instructing is, "Stop complaining. We've gots to

00:45:38.947 --> 00:45:45.940
"get these tunnels boom-booming before more cursed
people come. Now you, place there, you place

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:53.210
"there, me, I place everywhere else." And they all
begin to scatter a bit and make their way towards

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:55.497
the two bridges to begin to cross over in the
direction of you.

00:45:55.497 --> 00:46:03.594
LAURA: Oh no! Oh god, and I start backing up
towards my companions. I run towards them and say

00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:07.868
They're on their way over here! They're going to
blow things up! I think the big one has the bag of

00:46:07.868 --> 00:46:09.318
candles on his back!

00:46:09.318 --> 00:46:11.317
TRAVIS: You sure you heard &lt;i&gt;blow&lt;/i&gt; things up?

00:46:11.317 --> 00:46:13.301
LAURA: Yeah, he said something about blowing
things up!

00:46:13.301 --> 00:46:14.763
LIAM: Where are you?

00:46:14.763 --> 00:46:21.705
LAURA: I'm right here! I punch him in the knee. I
could've punched something else.

00:46:21.705 --> 00:46:24.079
TRAVIS: We've got to stop them. There's nine of
them.

00:46:24.079 --> 00:46:25.357
LAURA: We can do it!

00:46:25.357 --> 00:46:26.688
TRAVIS: There's five of us.

00:46:26.688 --> 00:46:29.966
LAURA: What if we take out one of the bridges
while they're on the bridge?! Cut the rope and

00:46:29.966 --> 00:46:32.294
then some of them that are on the bridge will
fall!

00:46:32.294 --> 00:46:36.419
MATT: While you're having this conversation two of
them have just now finished traversing the bridge.

00:46:36.419 --> 00:46:38.245
LAURA and TRAVIS: Shit.

00:46:38.245 --> 00:46:40.480
LAURA: Quick! Go cut the bridge!

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.973
TRAVIS: Go cut the bridge?

00:46:41.973 --> 00:46:43.616
LAURA: Cut the rope on the bridge!

00:46:43.616 --> 00:46:45.727
JENNIFER: Can I take them out while--

00:46:45.727 --> 00:46:47.566
MATT: If you'd like to.

00:46:47.566 --> 00:46:48.828
LIAM: This is the time.

00:46:48.828 --> 00:46:50.239
JENNIFER: This is the time to take them out.

00:46:50.239 --> 00:46:52.221
MATT: All right, so as they're having this
conversation you pull around the corner with your

00:46:52.221 --> 00:46:56.576
hand crossbow and make a shot at the closest one
to you. You see one of the kobolds lumbering up,

00:46:56.576 --> 00:47:01.157
he's reaching into his satchel and he's pulling
out a small rod of some kind. Go ahead and roll an

00:47:01.157 --> 00:47:01.981
attack.

00:47:01.981 --> 00:47:04.424
LIAM: All right. And it's at advantage because
she's hiding, yeah?

00:47:04.424 --> 00:47:05.453
MATT: Exactly.

00:47:05.453 --> 00:47:09.903
LIAM: Yeah, so roll it twice and take the higher
one. So it's a 17 plus your attack from the

00:47:09.903 --> 00:47:12.877
crossbow is a 25.

00:47:12.877 --> 00:47:15.248
JENNIFER: 26. 17 plus nine.

00:47:15.248 --> 00:47:16.872
MATT: Oh that most definitely hits.

00:47:16.872 --> 00:47:17.950
LIAM: Plus eight.

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:19.573
JENNIFER: Oh sorry, plus eight, sorry, yes, right.
25.

00:47:19.573 --> 00:47:21.770
MATT: That most definitely hits. So go ahead and
roll damage on that with sneak attack damage.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:25.257
LIAM: So the damage is a 1d6, so you roll one of
those cubes.

00:47:25.257 --> 00:47:27.140
JENNIFER: One?

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:32.358
LIAM: Okay, three plus your sneak attack damage
which is at your level--

00:47:32.358 --> 00:47:34.933
LAURA: Probably 1d6. 2d6 maybe?

00:47:34.933 --> 00:47:38.197
MATT: It's 4d6. It's under the attack.

00:47:38.197 --> 00:47:39.574
JENNIFER: There it is. 4d6.

00:47:39.574 --> 00:47:40.916
LAURA: 4d6?! What level are we?!

00:47:40.916 --> 00:47:42.406
MATT: Level seven.

00:47:42.406 --> 00:47:43.814
LAURA: Oh shit.

00:47:43.814 --> 00:47:45.605
JENNIFER: So I add ten. 17.

00:47:45.605 --> 00:47:47.066
LIAM: Plus the five.

00:47:47.066 --> 00:47:48.267
JENNIFER: So 22.

00:47:48.267 --> 00:47:53.011
MATT: 22 points of damage. So, as that one crosses
the way it pulls out its rod and (grunting)

00:47:53.011 --> 00:48:02.285
(arrow whooshing) (cry of pain) and goes straight down,
limp, drunk ET style, on the ground, slams face

00:48:02.285 --> 00:48:04.429
first and is done.

00:48:04.429 --> 00:48:06.327
JENNIFER: We need to get the other one now don't
we?

00:48:06.327 --> 00:48:10.622
MATT: At this point, the one that just finished
crossing the bridge on the other side goes "Cera!

00:48:10.622 --> 00:48:18.126
"Get up!" Walks over and kicks him. Then looks over
and sees you holding the hand crossbow and goes

00:48:18.126 --> 00:48:19.542
(screaming).

00:48:19.542 --> 00:48:23.018
TALIESIN: Do I have time to get one attack in?

00:48:23.018 --> 00:48:24.997
MATT: I need you all to roll initiative.

00:48:24.997 --> 00:48:26.065
(groaning)

00:48:26.065 --> 00:48:27.326
JENNIFER: What's initiative?

00:48:27.326 --> 00:48:29.871
LIAM: So we're seeing what the order is so roll 20
again and add this. And then keep that number in

00:48:29.871 --> 00:48:34.286
your head. For a moment. You changed it, roll it
again.

00:48:34.286 --> 00:48:35.910
JENNIFER: I saw what it was but--

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:37.360
LIAM: Well if you know what it was then keep it.

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.608
JENNIFER: I do know what--

00:48:38.608 --> 00:48:43.865
LIAM: I can't read your die Jen! Yes, that's good,
that's 23. Okay.

00:48:43.865 --> 00:48:45.315
MATT: 23?

00:48:45.315 --> 00:48:47.691
LIAM: Just remember that. Why can't I roll well?
Okay.

00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:49.546
TRAVIS: What did you roll?

00:48:49.546 --> 00:48:50.773
LIAM: 11.

00:48:50.773 --> 00:48:55.792
MATT: All right so we have 23, we have-- how do
you spell your character's name again?

00:48:55.792 --> 00:48:59.368
JENNIFER: A-E-R-W-Y-N but it's I-N, either one.

00:48:59.368 --> 00:49:00.625
MATT: Aerwin? Okay cool.

00:49:00.625 --> 00:49:02.340
LIAM: J-E-L-L-O.

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:05.175
MATT: There you go. Perfect.

00:49:05.175 --> 00:49:06.940
TALIESIN: 14.

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:10.001
MATT: So it's 20 to 15? Anybody?

00:49:10.001 --> 00:49:10.876
LAURA: Oh.

00:49:10.876 --> 00:49:11.932
TRAVIS: She had 23 right?

00:49:11.932 --> 00:49:13.033
MATT and JENNIFER: Yeah.

00:49:13.033 --> 00:49:14.252
TRAVIS: Oh, what was it?

00:49:14.252 --> 00:49:15.317
MATT: 20 to 15.

00:49:15.317 --> 00:49:16.404
TRAVIS: I'm 15.

00:49:16.404 --> 00:49:18.392
MATT: All righty. And spell your name for me real
fast.

00:49:18.392 --> 00:49:20.053
TRAVIS: L-O-H-K-O-R.

00:49:20.053 --> 00:49:21.645
LAURA: Lohkor.

00:49:21.645 --> 00:49:29.124
MATT: 15 to ten.

00:49:29.124 --> 00:49:30.787
TALIESIN: 14.

00:49:30.787 --> 00:49:31.882
LAURA: 13.

00:49:31.882 --> 00:49:33.476
LIAM: 11.

00:49:33.476 --> 00:49:38.256
LAURA: Lies. 12.

00:49:38.256 --> 00:49:45.888
MATT: All righty and then--?

00:49:45.888 --> 00:49:48.284
LIAM: 11. Quazirat.

00:49:48.284 --> 00:49:49.645
TRAVIS: Quasimodo.

00:49:49.645 --> 00:49:53.234
LIAM: Q-U-A-Z-I.

00:49:53.234 --> 00:49:57.184
LAURA: I'm naming you Toes, because that's all I
can remember.

00:49:57.184 --> 00:50:01.228
MATT: All right, cool. So top of the round as all
the kobolds now notice you guys clustered right

00:50:01.228 --> 00:50:07.418
there at the entrance of the cavern, start rushing
over the bridge, their pickaxes out and the larger

00:50:07.418 --> 00:50:11.982
one on the opposite side, seeing this, seems to be
preparing for something. What are you doing?

00:50:12.107 --> 00:50:13.883
JENNIFER: I'm loading up the crossbow.

00:50:13.883 --> 00:50:17.091
MATT: Okay, so you pull out another bolt, load it
up and staying there, and you're going to fire at

00:50:17.091 --> 00:50:18.385
which one?

00:50:18.385 --> 00:50:20.933
JENNIFER: They're all behind the one in the
front?

00:50:20.933 --> 00:50:25.754
MATT: There's the one that just kicked the guy you
killed and there's two sets that are running

00:50:25.754 --> 00:50:27.795
across the bridges currently over the water.

00:50:27.795 --> 00:50:29.432
JENNIFER: I'm going for their leader.

00:50:29.432 --> 00:50:32.553
MATT: Okay cool, so you might have to get a little
closer, you're about 40 feet away from him or you

00:50:32.553 --> 00:50:35.153
can fire from now but you'll have disadvantage on
the attack. But up to you.

00:50:35.153 --> 00:50:38.744
JENNIFER: I can move a little closer. I'll move,
hit and then move, right?

00:50:38.744 --> 00:50:39.565
MATT: Okay.

00:50:39.565 --> 00:50:40.953
JENNIFER: I can do that can't I?

00:50:40.953 --> 00:50:43.268
MATT: You can do that, yeah. So you go ahead and
move forward your 30 feet, that'll get you into

00:50:43.268 --> 00:50:48.533
a 30 foot range. You'll be almost in melee range
with one of the kobolds. Go ahead and take a shot

00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:51.171
at the leader.

00:50:51.171 --> 00:50:53.362
JENNIFER: And that's these? No.

00:50:53.362 --> 00:50:58.343
LIAM: To hit you roll d20. So roll the roundy and
add your attack bonus for crossbow.

00:50:58.343 --> 00:50:59.601
JENNIFER: 16.

00:50:59.601 --> 00:51:03.509
MATT: 16 just hits. So you roll damage, it's not
sneak attack because you're not hidden.

00:51:03.509 --> 00:51:06.068
LIAM: Yeah, so now you're just rolling d6, a cube.

00:51:06.068 --> 00:51:10.540
JENNIFER: d6 cube. Which one's the d6? It's this
one! Okay, there we go.

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:12.268
LIAM: And add a five.

00:51:12.268 --> 00:51:13.381
JENNIFER: Seven.

00:51:13.381 --> 00:51:16.993
MATT: There we go, seven points of damage,
(grunting). They seem angry as it begins to reach

00:51:16.993 --> 00:51:22.209
and fiddle with the back of his pack on his back.
You can use your bonus action to dash backward if

00:51:22.209 --> 00:51:23.237
you'd like to back into the cavern entrance.

00:51:23.237 --> 00:51:25.968
JENNIFER: Yes, I think that's most useful.

00:51:25.968 --> 00:51:29.510
MATT: Okay so, after firing the kobolds are
rushing in and you back up, getting behind your

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:33.076
allies to protect you. All right, that brings it
to Lohkor.

00:51:33.076 --> 00:51:36.429
TRAVIS: I don't know why we always try and do this
stealthily. I get the warhammer out and I'll reach

00:51:36.429 --> 00:51:39.328
forward to the one and take a big swing right in
his face.

00:51:39.328 --> 00:51:42.677
MATT: Go for it. This is the one who kicked his
friend trying to wake him up.

00:51:42.677 --> 00:51:44.320
TRAVIS: 18.

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.375
MATT: 18 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

00:51:45.375 --> 00:51:51.708
TRAVIS: That's 1d8. 13 points of bludgeoning
damage.

00:51:51.708 --> 00:51:55.002
MATT: 13 points of bludgeoning damage. All right.

00:51:55.002 --> 00:51:57.253
TRAVIS: I have another one because of extra
attack?

00:51:57.253 --> 00:51:58.501
MATT: You do.

00:51:58.501 --> 00:52:01.441
TRAVIS: Nice! 15.

00:52:01.441 --> 00:52:02.854
MATT: 15 hits.

00:52:02.854 --> 00:52:06.099
TRAVIS: Nice. And that is seven points of
bludgeoning damage.

00:52:06.099 --> 00:52:10.517
MATT: All right. As you rush forward the first hit
hits him upside the chin. You see a spatter of

00:52:10.517 --> 00:52:15.711
blood across the rock behind you. He gets back and
pulls out his pickaxe, his angry whiskered face,

00:52:15.888 --> 00:52:20.006
you see fury in his eyes and you sink the hammer
into his face. He's like (cry of pain) (gurgle)

00:52:20.006 --> 00:52:22.203
and he falls to the ground, dead.

00:52:22.203 --> 00:52:27.319
TRAVIS: Yes! I turn to the rest of them and I say:
Let them have it! And I take off running into the

00:52:27.319 --> 00:52:28.594
fray.

00:52:28.594 --> 00:52:33.904
MATT: All right, great. As that's happening, you
running, the larger leader in the back who

00:52:33.904 --> 00:52:41.336
finishes fiddling with his pack pulls a small rod,
holds it up to the top of the candle on his head

00:52:41.336 --> 00:52:50.978
and you watch it spark, and lobs it in an arc over
to where you are. The kobolds stop running and

00:52:50.978 --> 00:52:56.011
watch it going as it arcs over, except for two of
them that weren't paying attention and are

00:52:56.011 --> 00:53:01.729
charging towards you as it (thudding) between your
legs, rolls a little behind you, and there's that

00:53:01.729 --> 00:53:08.387
brief moment where everything slows down for but
an instance before it explodes in a cacophonous

00:53:08.387 --> 00:53:13.021
explosion of flame and force. I need all of you to
make a dexterity saving throw.

00:53:13.021 --> 00:53:15.398
JENNIFER: So that's the d20?

00:53:15.398 --> 00:53:24.716
LIAM: So yeah, roll d20. Dexterity save. So what
you get on that? Ten plus that is here. Nine.

00:53:24.716 --> 00:53:28.284
MATT: All right so, what did you get?

00:53:28.284 --> 00:53:29.485
JENNIFER: 18.

00:53:29.485 --> 00:53:30.611
MATT: Okay, that succeeds.

00:53:30.611 --> 00:53:31.464
TALIESIN: Eight.

00:53:31.464 --> 00:53:32.304
MATT: Nope.

00:53:32.304 --> 00:53:33.142
LAURA: 18.

00:53:33.142 --> 00:53:34.082
MATT: Succeeds.

00:53:34.082 --> 00:53:35.073
TRAVIS: 16.

00:53:35.073 --> 00:53:36.184
MATT: Just barely succeeds.

00:53:36.184 --> 00:53:38.753
LIAM: And this is a save, not ability skill,
correct?

00:53:38.753 --> 00:53:39.670
MATT: Right.

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:41.107
LIAM: Oh, that's big 11.

00:53:41.107 --> 00:53:42.129
MATT: That's a failure.

00:53:42.129 --> 00:53:45.599
LIAM: No. I don't think so.

00:53:45.599 --> 00:53:49.562
MATT: All right so, Bundle and Quazirat, you guys
both suffer 18 points of fire damage.

00:53:49.562 --> 00:53:50.820
LIAM: Seems fake.

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:57.026
MATT: The rest of you suffer nine points of fire
damage. And the two nearest kobolds who are

00:53:57.026 --> 00:54:02.969
rushing in to go after Lohkor also explode into
pieces and are thrown behind you. You see them

00:54:02.969 --> 00:54:12.912
running like (screaming) (explosion) and are
destroyed by their own dynamite. And you hear this

00:54:12.912 --> 00:54:19.559
laughter at the back of the cavern. "Firework!" He
seems to be rather excited and given this bit of

00:54:19.559 --> 00:54:25.768
fury inspirational boost from the carnage he's
caused. All right, that's going to end his turn.

00:54:25.768 --> 00:54:29.673
He's going to stay right there at the edge.
Bundle, your turn.

00:54:29.673 --> 00:54:42.529
TALIESIN: Everything hurts, one second. I'm
finding a thing--

00:54:42.529 --> 00:54:47.216
TRAVIS: New class abilities. We're all like,
flexing in the thing that we've never played

00:54:47.216 --> 00:54:48.439
before.

00:54:48.439 --> 00:54:49.941
TALIESIN: I know, this is so difficult.

00:54:49.941 --> 00:54:51.512
JENNIFER: At least I'm not the only one.

00:54:51.512 --> 00:54:59.853
TALIESIN: I'm going to quickly cast Mass Healing
Word on everybody while I, not even get up, I'm

00:54:59.853 --> 00:55:02.396
going to sit up and cast Mass Healing Word on the
group.

00:55:02.396 --> 00:55:05.862
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll that. That's a d4
plus your--

00:55:05.862 --> 00:55:14.095
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right it's auto. So, d4 plus
wisdom modifier. That's six.

00:55:14.095 --> 00:55:16.260
MATT: All right, so everyone heals six hit
points.

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:24.257
TALIESIN: And I'm going to use my bonus action to
create a Spiritual Weapon.

00:55:24.257 --> 00:55:27.644
MATT: Okay. What kind of weapon is it taking the
form of?

00:55:27.644 --> 00:55:37.079
TALIESIN: A giant hammer that looks a little bit
like an anvil that's bigger than his hammer. It's

00:55:37.079 --> 00:55:44.499
going to manifest right above the main kobold's
head ten feet up.

00:55:44.499 --> 00:55:50.415
MATT: All right, so as it begins to apparate in
the sky, Lohkor, you look across and you can see

00:55:50.415 --> 00:55:52.180
the hammer, slightly larger than your hammer,
apparate.

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:53.679
TRAVIS: Son of a Bundle!

00:55:53.679 --> 00:55:59.604
MATT: It does take a swing at the leader, so go
for it. I believe when you summon, it gets to take

00:55:59.604 --> 00:56:00.682
one hit.

00:56:00.682 --> 00:56:01.979
TALIESIN: Does it get to take one hit?

00:56:01.979 --> 00:56:03.395
MATT: Double-check.

00:56:03.395 --> 00:56:04.666
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll go for it.

00:56:04.666 --> 00:56:06.927
MATT: Spiritual Weapon. Yep!

00:56:06.927 --> 00:56:08.937
TALIESIN: That's 15?

00:56:08.937 --> 00:56:14.413
MATT: 15 unfortunately misses. It swings, and you
can see the kobold look up as it sees your eyes

00:56:14.413 --> 00:56:19.119
trace up and he goes, (growl). Sees it, (growl).
Leaps backward as it slams into the ground,

00:56:19.119 --> 00:56:22.269
cracking the stone beneath and he dodges out of
the way. (laughs)

00:56:22.269 --> 00:56:24.986
TRAVIS: Still with the performance issues, eh,
Bundle?

00:56:24.986 --> 00:56:29.567
TALIESIN: I'm getting up! And I use my movement to
stand up and shake off.

00:56:29.567 --> 00:56:33.336
MATT: All right, cool. Ending Bundle's turn,
that'll bring us to Grendlemine.

00:56:33.336 --> 00:56:36.407
LAURA: Okay, it's Greldamine.

00:56:36.407 --> 00:56:40.093
MATT: Greldamine, sorry! Reading my own
handwriting's a problem.

00:56:40.093 --> 00:56:46.376
LAURA: Are any of them in a line? Are they on the
bridge still?

00:56:46.376 --> 00:56:49.584
MATT: On the bridge there's three on each bridge
that are in a line.

00:56:49.584 --> 00:56:51.821
LAURA: And then the big one?

00:56:51.821 --> 00:56:57.192
MATT: Actually, no, at this point, there's two,
because two of them got blown away. There's two on

00:56:57.192 --> 00:56:58.548
each bridge right now.

00:56:58.548 --> 00:57:02.861
LAURA: Okay, and the big one, is he lined up with
a bridge, or is he between the bridges?

00:57:02.861 --> 00:57:04.319
MATT: No, he's in between the two.

00:57:04.319 --> 00:57:05.425
LAURA: Okay.

00:57:05.425 --> 00:57:06.505
LIAM: On other side.

00:57:06.505 --> 00:57:08.030
JENNIFER: Is Greldamine still invisible?

00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:09.374
MATT: She is currently.

00:57:09.374 --> 00:57:12.993
LIAM: What's the length of those bridge,
guesstimation-wise?

00:57:12.993 --> 00:57:16.962
MATT: The bridges are about 20 feet across, 15 to
20. They're not super long bridges; it's not a

00:57:16.962 --> 00:57:18.165
huge chamber.

00:57:18.165 --> 00:57:20.389
JENNIFER: How many of them are left now? We were
down to eight.

00:57:20.389 --> 00:57:23.998
LIAM: Five total: two on each bridge, big guy
other side. Big is relative term.

00:57:23.998 --> 00:57:31.861
LAURA: Okay. For fear of damaging the perhaps bag
of candles on the big one's back, that would be

00:57:31.861 --> 00:57:48.092
bad, I'm going to cast Burning Hands towards one
of the bridges with two of the things on it.

00:57:48.092 --> 00:57:53.092
MATT: Okay! So you rush forward as two of the
surviving kobolds-- on the right or the left

00:57:53.092 --> 00:57:53.933
bridge?

00:57:53.933 --> 00:57:55.205
LAURA: The left!

00:57:55.205 --> 00:57:58.693
MATT: Okay, so you run over to the left bridge
and, as the kobolds are rushing across with their

00:57:58.693 --> 00:58:00.714
pickaxes out (heavy breathing), you--

00:58:00.714 --> 00:58:02.285
LAURA: (screams)

00:58:02.285 --> 00:58:07.894
MATT: You watch as her invisible form suddenly
appears, apparating as the illusion that has been

00:58:07.894 --> 00:58:14.076
hiding her vanishes. As a flamethrower gout of
fire burns out from in front, engulfing both of

00:58:14.076 --> 00:58:20.226
the kobolds. What's the saving throw on that?
What's your DC? Your spell DC?

00:58:20.226 --> 00:58:22.132
LAURA: My DC is 16.

00:58:22.132 --> 00:58:28.789
MATT: 16! No! Yes! One of them succeeds, one of
them fails.

00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:29.785
LAURA: Okay.

00:58:29.785 --> 00:58:30.947
MATT: So, what's the damage on that?

00:58:30.947 --> 00:58:31.984
LAURA: 3d6 fire damage.

00:58:31.984 --> 00:58:33.435
MATT: So go ahead and roll 3d6.

00:58:33.435 --> 00:58:34.967
LAURA: And it sets things on fire.

00:58:34.967 --> 00:58:37.631
MATT: Yes. The bridge is definitely on fire.

00:58:37.631 --> 00:58:41.147
LAURA: Nine damage.

00:58:41.147 --> 00:58:47.869
MATT: All right, nine damage. Then one of them
takes four damage. Okay, so they're like, "Ugh!"

00:58:47.869 --> 00:58:51.813
They pull back a bit, and you can see the edge of
their whiskers are curling in and burned. The

00:58:51.813 --> 00:58:55.902
fur's seared at the edges. Some of them actually
have caught fire and a little bit of smoke is

00:58:55.902 --> 00:58:58.891
pouring off. But the edge of the bridge that
they're standing on, that you're right in front

00:58:58.891 --> 00:59:03.505
of, has definitely caught fire. And you can see
the two kobolds are now trying to figure out what

00:59:03.505 --> 00:59:05.697
to do as they're stuck in the middle right now.

00:59:05.697 --> 00:59:10.548
LAURA: I'm going to run away from the bridge and
hide behind Lohkor's legs.

00:59:10.548 --> 00:59:14.147
MATT: You used your movement to approach the
bridge to cast Burning Hands.

00:59:14.147 --> 00:59:16.022
LAURA: Oh, I did? Great! Can I move at all?

00:59:16.022 --> 00:59:17.536
MATT: I'll give you five feet.

00:59:17.536 --> 00:59:18.672
LAURA: I'll back up five feet.

00:59:18.672 --> 00:59:22.279
MATT: (small steps). Their eyes are trained on
&lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt;

00:59:22.279 --> 00:59:23.459
LAURA: Shit!

00:59:23.459 --> 00:59:26.794
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. That brings
it to their turn. So, as far as kobolds go, the

00:59:26.794 --> 00:59:30.509
two that are on the bridge start rushing towards
you. I'm going to go ahead and see if the bridge

00:59:30.509 --> 00:59:37.789
maintains its coherence for both of them. For the
first one it's fine. The second one it is not. So

00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:44.193
the first kobold runs forward and it's going to
swing at you with its pickaxe. Because you were

00:59:44.193 --> 00:59:47.760
damaged by another kobold, it gets a bonus to
damage.

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.334
LAURA: I was? Oh, I was.

00:59:49.334 --> 00:59:54.046
MATT: From the explosion earlier. So, that is
going to be a 20 to hit?

00:59:54.046 --> 00:59:55.081
LAURA: Oh.

00:59:55.081 --> 00:59:56.573
MATT: I believe that hits, right?

00:59:56.573 --> 00:59:57.972
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:59:57.972 --> 01:00:02.582
MATT: All right, and you suffer ten points of
piercing damage as the pickaxe hacks into your

01:00:02.582 --> 01:00:08.027
shoulder as it rushes past. The other one, as it's
running towards you, you see it pulling back its

01:00:08.027 --> 01:00:13.487
pickaxe to follow through and try and attack with
its friend as the final ropes release. And you

01:00:13.487 --> 01:00:19.289
watch him go (yells) and vanish into the water
below. You hear him (gurgles) as he gets carried

01:00:19.289 --> 01:00:23.360
by the water current further down the river and
he's trying to swim upstream. He's currently stuck

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:28.282
in the middle of trying to figure out what to do
there. The other two rush across the other side of

01:00:28.282 --> 01:00:34.238
the chamber, finish traversing that bridge, and go
straight towards you, Lohkor, because you're the

01:00:34.238 --> 01:00:40.263
closest to them at this point. That's going to be
a 17 to hit.

01:00:40.263 --> 01:00:41.322
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:00:41.322 --> 01:00:46.713
MATT: You reach out and you parry off to the side.
The other one's going to go ahead and instead he's

01:00:46.713 --> 01:00:50.823
going to-- That's a 22 to hit.

01:00:50.823 --> 01:00:51.829
TRAVIS: That does hit.

01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:58.875
MATT: So you go ahead and suffer six points of
piercing damage. The first one you deflect, the

01:00:58.875 --> 01:01:02.307
second one hits you, jamming into one of the
plates, bending the armor, and hitting you in the

01:01:02.307 --> 01:01:06.172
side. You feel your body tense from the severe
pain. But it's nothing, you've had worse.

01:01:06.172 --> 01:01:08.228
TRAVIS: Yeah. Just not the face.

01:01:08.228 --> 01:01:12.735
MATT: Quazirat, you're up.

01:01:12.735 --> 01:01:18.424
LIAM: Is there a clear path between where I'm
standing and either bridge?

01:01:18.424 --> 01:01:24.137
MATT: Well, one bridge is currently collapsed. The
one on the right you could run through, but you

01:01:24.137 --> 01:01:29.743
would probably be getting attacked from both the
kobolds that ran across and are blocking the path.

01:01:29.743 --> 01:01:32.288
You'd have to take an attack of opportunity from
both of them.

01:01:32.288 --> 01:01:37.985
LIAM: Yeah, that sounds fun. I'm going to run for
edge of bridge on this side. How far is that for

01:01:37.985 --> 01:01:39.257
me where I'm starting?

01:01:39.257 --> 01:01:42.289
MATT: I'd say it's about 15 feet from you now.

01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:44.801
LIAM: That's good. I like it. 15 feet is good. I
run towards edge.

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:50.488
MATT: Okay, so you run to the edge. You go past
the two kobolds. Are you just running past them?

01:01:50.488 --> 01:01:51.715
LIAM: Yes.

01:01:51.715 --> 01:01:55.728
MATT: All right, they both get attacks of
opportunity on you. The first one is-- Wow, the

01:01:55.728 --> 01:01:59.968
golden snitch is working for me now. That is 21 to
hit.

01:01:59.968 --> 01:02:01.742
LIAM: Sure, that hits.

01:02:01.742 --> 01:02:07.016
MATT: That is seven points of piercing damage as
the pickaxe swings and snags you in the back of

01:02:07.016 --> 01:02:11.129
the shoulder blade. The other one is a 17 to hit.

01:02:11.129 --> 01:02:12.529
LIAM: No, eat shit.

01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:17.620
MATT: That one scrapes across the back of your
armor and makes no effective impact. You continue

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:19.238
rushing across the bridge--

01:02:19.238 --> 01:02:24.602
LIAM: No. I used 15 feet to get here. I'm going to
do my running long jump for 25 feet over 20 foot bridge

01:02:24.602 --> 01:02:30.461
you describe to me and land on other side. And
move up to this asshole on other side.

01:02:30.461 --> 01:02:40.746
MATT: Okay. You cannot jump further than your
movement speed, technically. So you run, you jump,

01:02:40.746 --> 01:02:46.630
and you're getting right towards the edge there. I
would like you to go ahead and make an acrobatics

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:47.354
check.

01:02:47.354 --> 01:02:50.777
LIAM: Oh, you think I would understand this
mechanic before this moment in my life at level

01:02:50.777 --> 01:02:52.525
seven. What kind of check?

01:02:52.525 --> 01:02:53.997
MATT: This would be an acrobatics check.

01:02:53.997 --> 01:03:08.719
LIAM: Okay. Oh, not great at all. But I get to add
two because of Remarkable Athlete, so hopefully

01:03:08.719 --> 01:03:11.238
that's enough. 14.

01:03:11.238 --> 01:03:18.743
MATT: 14. You were prepared. You make your way
through the air, barely catch the edge of where

01:03:18.743 --> 01:03:23.569
the other platform begins, and you roll over the
shoulder into it. And as you come to stand, you're

01:03:23.569 --> 01:03:28.267
right there before the leader kobold who's there
with his giant pack there ready as he has another

01:03:28.267 --> 01:03:31.798
one of these sticks that he's currently trying to
pull up to the candle on his head. What are you

01:03:31.798 --> 01:03:32.676
going to do?

01:03:32.676 --> 01:03:37.476
LIAM: I'm how far from him?

01:03:37.476 --> 01:03:38.701
MATT: You're right up against him.

01:03:38.701 --> 01:03:47.217
LIAM: Oh, well I'm going to take his head off. I
had a pet rat but I don't care. Here we go. Oh,

01:03:47.217 --> 01:04:00.705
that's a one! But I have an extra attack, so I
will go again. Oh, that's so bad! That's a 12.

01:04:00.705 --> 01:04:08.066
MATT: As you confidently grin, your massive
draenei body looking down upon this kobold, who

01:04:08.066 --> 01:04:13.547
looks like he got caught with his hand in the
cookie jar, you swing wide with-- What weapon are

01:04:13.547 --> 01:04:14.842
you using?

01:04:14.842 --> 01:04:15.895
LIAM: I'm using greatsword.

01:04:15.895 --> 01:04:20.477
MATT: This giant two-handed cleaver that swings,
and the kobold goes (hums).

01:04:20.477 --> 01:04:24.057
LIAM: I'm going to attempt to embarrass myself
further and use action surge.

01:04:24.057 --> 01:04:28.132
MATT: Okay, make two more attacks. He dodges both
of your swings.

01:04:28.132 --> 01:04:31.040
LIAM: Colville, don't fuck me, Colville!

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.337
MATT: It's now laughing.

01:04:33.337 --> 01:04:36.304
LIAM: 15 for the one.

01:04:36.304 --> 01:04:38.168
MATT: 15 just misses.

01:04:38.168 --> 01:04:40.808
LIAM: But this last one is okay! 17.

01:04:40.808 --> 01:04:42.102
MATT: 17 does hit.

01:04:42.102 --> 01:04:43.173
LIAM: Yes, finally!

01:04:43.173 --> 01:04:46.185
MATT: He dodges the third one and goes, "You have
problem? Can't hit?"

01:04:46.185 --> 01:04:57.126
LIAM: Oh Fievel, your troubles are just beginning.
That is ten slashing damage.

01:04:57.126 --> 01:05:03.472
MATT: Ten slashing damage. You take a chunk out of
his shoulder. "This favorite shoulder!"

01:05:03.472 --> 01:05:09.130
LIAM: Kiss my sword. The hilt says Leeron Jenkins.
Let's get this shit started!

01:05:09.130 --> 01:05:17.526
MATT: Perfect. Ending your turn. To the top. It is
your turn, Aerwin. So there are now currently four

01:05:17.526 --> 01:05:25.216
living kobolds. Well, one of them has fallen into
the river, who is currently beneath the water,

01:05:25.216 --> 01:05:29.030
struggling against the current. There is one that
is partially damaged that is currently up against

01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:32.568
and fighting him. Actually, no, two of them that
are up against fighting you and one that's up

01:05:32.568 --> 01:05:33.736
against you.

01:05:33.736 --> 01:05:36.559
JENNIFER: But this one also--

01:05:36.559 --> 01:05:39.558
MATT: Yes, there's the main leader across the way
that he's currently up against.

01:05:39.558 --> 01:05:44.574
LIAM: So, you attack this guy, you get sneak
attack damage because I am right up against him.

01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:46.201
JENNIFER: Yes, I want to do that.

01:05:46.201 --> 01:05:47.809
MATT: All right, so you're taking another shot
with your crossbow?

01:05:47.809 --> 01:05:48.853
JENNIFER: Yes.

01:05:48.853 --> 01:05:54.776
MATT: All right, so you load up another bolt. And
then aiming across the way. Making your way up

01:05:54.776 --> 01:05:59.227
close to where the bridge is, you'll end up being
in the melee range of the one that's fighting her,

01:05:59.227 --> 01:06:00.671
but you can still make the strike.

01:06:00.671 --> 01:06:02.447
LIAM: Acceptable risk.

01:06:02.447 --> 01:06:05.751
JENNIFER: All right, so I roll a d20?

01:06:05.751 --> 01:06:07.455
MATT: Go ahead and roll your attack.

01:06:07.455 --> 01:06:10.474
LIAM: What'd you get? Plus your crossbow--

01:06:10.474 --> 01:06:12.998
JENNIFER: 19.

01:06:12.998 --> 01:06:15.196
MATT: 19 hits, go ahead and roll damage plus sneak
attack damage.

01:06:15.196 --> 01:06:21.439
LIAM: So, 1d6 to start, then you add the other
cubes. Okay, that's good.

01:06:21.439 --> 01:06:27.588
JENNIFER: And then I add these guys? Okay. 18.

01:06:27.588 --> 01:06:28.823
LIAM: Plus?

01:06:28.823 --> 01:06:29.849
JENNIFER: 23.

01:06:29.849 --> 01:06:37.167
MATT: As the kobold's still laughing after the
blows of your warrior friend swinging wide, It's

01:06:37.167 --> 01:06:43.929
like, "It's fun, I take you with me! It's--" You
watch as a crossbow bolt slinks right into where

01:06:43.929 --> 01:06:50.678
the top of the clavicle in the kobold's neck is.
It's reaching up to try and pull it out. Its

01:06:50.678 --> 01:06:56.659
fingers look like it's going numb and it looks
hurt. It's holding on but it's hurt. That's a

01:06:56.659 --> 01:07:00.109
nice, slick shot. So, you've made your movement.
You have a bonus action if you wanted to do

01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:01.098
anything.

01:07:01.098 --> 01:07:05.046
JENNIFER: Well, I'm right next to the one that's
attacking her, correct? I think I'll turn around

01:07:05.046 --> 01:07:06.263
with the short sword--

01:07:06.263 --> 01:07:12.856
LIAM: Nope, you cannot do that with bonus. But is
she up against any kobolds at the moment?

01:07:12.856 --> 01:07:14.979
MATT: She's right next to one that's been fighting
her.

01:07:14.979 --> 01:07:20.766
LIAM: Well, the best you could do with a bonus is
maybe to disengage. Which means get away from them

01:07:20.766 --> 01:07:24.297
so they cannot hurt you. But you cannot hit again
with--

01:07:24.297 --> 01:07:26.264
JENNIFER: Okay, I'll disengage.

01:07:26.264 --> 01:07:29.403
LAURA: Yeah, leave me alone next to it, thank you.
Thank you for the good advice.

01:07:29.403 --> 01:07:31.650
LIAM: That's good advice. Just dance back a little
bit.

01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:34.494
MATT: So with the five feet of your movement left,
you go ahead and step away, using your bonus

01:07:34.494 --> 01:07:39.739
action to disengage, carefully stepping from the
kobold as it's going feral right now, feeling

01:07:39.739 --> 01:07:41.968
surrounded. That ends your turn. You're up,
Lohkor.

01:07:41.968 --> 01:07:50.174
TRAVIS: Yeah, I am &lt;i&gt;over&lt;/i&gt; these guys right next to
me. Warhammer! That is a 22.

01:07:50.174 --> 01:07:52.693
MATT: 22 will definitely hit.

01:07:52.693 --> 01:07:56.926
TRAVIS: That is 12 points of bludgeoning damage.

01:07:56.926 --> 01:08:00.448
MATT: 12 points of bludgeoning damage. As it comes
down, the hammer slams into the chest area of one

01:08:00.448 --> 01:08:06.370
of the kobolds that's harassing you. It hits him
and you hear this little squeak sound as the chest

01:08:06.370 --> 01:08:11.379
cavity takes a very heavy blow. Still standing,
but it's hurt.

01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:17.350
TRAVIS: Still standing, eh? Round two! That is a
25.

01:08:17.350 --> 01:08:19.874
MATT: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll
damage.

01:08:19.874 --> 01:08:22.733
TRAVIS: Another 12 points of bludgeoning damage.

01:08:22.733 --> 01:08:27.079
MATT: And with that you use the momentum of
pulling away to swing upward and from the

01:08:27.079 --> 01:08:31.841
underhand to hit. It snaps against the bottom of
the kobold's jaw and you hear its neck (cracks)

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:37.979
from the impact and it falls onto its back as its
legs curl back into its torso. And it's done.

01:08:37.979 --> 01:08:42.508
TRAVIS: With my bonus action I turn and point to
the last standing one: My eye sees you.

01:08:42.508 --> 01:08:50.693
MATT: You swear you see a slight tinkle dribble
down its leg. All right, that ends your turn. At

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:59.351
this point, the leader over there who's glaring at
you goes, "No, Ham has to finish his work!" And

01:08:59.351 --> 01:09:05.679
he's going to go ahead and grab one of the-- Yeah,
it regenerates. Rolled a five. He pulls another

01:09:05.679 --> 01:09:09.373
what you recognize now to be sticks of dynamite.
And looking at his pack you can see his pack is

01:09:09.373 --> 01:09:16.579
filled. It wasn't candles in that pack. It is
jam-filled with explosives. And he goes rushing

01:09:16.579 --> 01:09:18.712
past you. You get an attack of opportunity on him.

01:09:18.712 --> 01:09:24.278
LIAM: Oh good, yes. He's got lots of candles!
Yeah, that's good. That's 24.

01:09:24.278 --> 01:09:25.343
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:09:25.343 --> 01:09:27.187
LAURA: Chop his head off!

01:09:27.187 --> 01:09:31.572
LIAM: I'm trying! It's a ten.

01:09:31.572 --> 01:09:38.393
MATT: Ten points of damage. (yells) Takes a heavy
hit but continues rushing past the bridge area.

01:09:38.393 --> 01:09:44.767
Then, as he's rushing, he lights it from the top
of his head and chucks it in your guys' direction.

01:09:44.767 --> 01:09:58.274
As it lands, it detonates, taking out-- let's see
here. Damage-wise, everybody but you needs to go

01:09:58.274 --> 01:10:00.857
ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw please.

01:10:00.857 --> 01:10:03.351
LAURA: Oh no, this is bad.

01:10:03.351 --> 01:10:08.870
LIAM: Okay, so you did quite good with 22, yeah.

01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:10.684
TRAVIS: That's a one.

01:10:10.684 --> 01:10:12.298
MATT: 21 points of fire damage.

01:10:12.298 --> 01:10:13.612
LAURA: 15.

01:10:13.612 --> 01:10:18.220
MATT: 15 just barely succeeds, so you take 12
points of fire damage.

01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:19.716
TALIESIN: Yeah, no.

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:26.688
MATT: I said 21, right? Sorry, so it's ten points
of fire damage. 21 points of fire damage.

01:10:26.688 --> 01:10:28.509
JENNIFER: 22.

01:10:28.509 --> 01:10:30.355
MATT: Ten points of fire damage.

01:10:30.355 --> 01:10:31.801
LIAM: Does she have evasion?

01:10:31.801 --> 01:10:33.405
MATT: You do, so you take nothing.

01:10:33.405 --> 01:10:36.247
LIAM: Zero! Because rogue is best class.

01:10:36.247 --> 01:10:43.584
MATT: So you, seeing this coming, you jump
backwards, grab the kobold that's in front, and

01:10:43.584 --> 01:10:49.184
use him to shield you from the blast. And he goes
(screams) and scatters into ash as it manages to

01:10:49.184 --> 01:10:55.060
detonate and explode the remaining kobolds in the
area. So all the kobolds that were with him have

01:10:55.060 --> 01:11:00.508
all fallen to the ground now, turned to ash, or
detonated in some way. And you can see as the

01:11:00.508 --> 01:11:10.227
leader of them is catching his breath across the
bridge, he goes, "Oh no." And he glances past with

01:11:10.227 --> 01:11:13.832
his long gaze, and you can look over at the other
kobolds that had their own small caches of

01:11:13.832 --> 01:11:18.268
dynamite sticks, some of which have been lit by
the recent explosion, that are rolling towards the

01:11:18.268 --> 01:11:20.182
rock wall where you guys entered.

01:11:20.182 --> 01:11:24.634
TRAVIS: We've got to go! Double dash, all the way
out!

01:11:24.634 --> 01:11:30.341
MATT: So you guys all start rushing towards where?
Off the bridge?

01:11:30.341 --> 01:11:32.365
LAURA: Across the bridge, right?

01:11:32.365 --> 01:11:39.353
MATT: All right. So, I need all of you guys to--
Let's have everyone roll an initiative check right

01:11:39.353 --> 01:11:43.516
now since technically the combat here is finished.
We're going to do this as to see who can manage to

01:11:43.516 --> 01:11:45.185
make it across before the explosion.

01:11:45.185 --> 01:11:46.786
TRAVIS: It's going to be an early night.

01:11:46.786 --> 01:11:48.837
TALIESIN: What's the check again?

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:53.787
MATT: Just roll initiative.

01:11:53.787 --> 01:11:55.183
LAURA: 19.

01:11:55.183 --> 01:11:56.375
TRAVIS: Four.

01:11:56.375 --> 01:11:59.464
TALIESIN: God, why am I rolling so bad? Ten.

01:11:59.464 --> 01:12:01.789
JENNIFER: 16.

01:12:01.789 --> 01:12:02.810
LIAM: 14.

01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:08.050
MATT: Okay. You were pretty much mostly fine
across the bridge. All of you go rushing past as

01:12:08.050 --> 01:12:15.365
you see Lohkor going (huffing and explosion). You
see the whole room behind him light up. You can

01:12:15.365 --> 01:12:23.637
see a silhouette. It's full-on movie style
explosion as you see it burn past him. You only

01:12:23.637 --> 01:12:28.890
catch the edge of it, which is good, because you
then only suffer eight points of fire damage. But

01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:35.096
you watch as the entrance you guys came through
falls and collapses, a series of boulders and

01:12:35.096 --> 01:12:39.121
rocks, the opposite end of the chamber falling in
on itself. Part of the river, you can see the

01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:44.565
kobold that's barely clawing its way out of the
water, (panting) "Huh?" (thud). A rock hits and

01:12:44.565 --> 01:12:51.264
smashes him across the bank. Part of the river
fills in and you can see now the bank splashing

01:12:51.264 --> 01:12:54.309
over and starting to try to make its way back. But
you guys are now on the opposite side of the

01:12:54.309 --> 01:12:58.995
chamber. It's quiet. You all take a minute to
breathe, look at your wounds. You're a bit singed

01:12:58.995 --> 01:13:00.048
around the way--

01:13:00.048 --> 01:13:04.648
TRAVIS: I'm putting out the fire in my hair. I use
Lay on Hands to put out the fire.

01:13:04.648 --> 01:13:08.619
LAURA: Oh, I forgot to do this. And I cast Mage
Armor on myself.

01:13:08.619 --> 01:13:12.974
TRAVIS: Before. Much better than after.

01:13:12.974 --> 01:13:16.331
TALIESIN: I'm going to maybe do a Prayer of
Healing. Also, technically speaking, I have

01:13:16.331 --> 01:13:20.588
Disciple of Light, which means-- Would everyone
have gained an extra five points?

01:13:20.588 --> 01:13:24.864
MATT: They would've, yes. Keep that in mind. Next
time. We'll say for now, you guys all would've

01:13:24.864 --> 01:13:28.682
healed an additional five points of damage because
he is really good at healing as a priest.

01:13:28.682 --> 01:13:35.787
LIAM: You want to take like five, or maybe even 20
minutes here before we go forward?

01:13:35.787 --> 01:13:37.199
TRAVIS: I mean we're hot on the trail.

01:13:37.199 --> 01:13:38.808
LAURA: Why do we need to do that?

01:13:38.808 --> 01:13:43.885
LIAM: I don't know. You know, conserving energy,
that kind of thing. Let's go! You want to kick

01:13:43.885 --> 01:13:46.231
ass, I can tell. Little one, let's go.

01:13:46.231 --> 01:13:53.573
JENNIFER: I'm with her. I will now call her Small
and Brave. I'm with Small and Brave. SB for short.

01:13:53.573 --> 01:14:00.471
TALIESIN: I can't do Prayer of Healing while we're
walking though, can I? It's just verbal.

01:14:00.471 --> 01:14:04.271
MATT: Is it the ten minute one? You have to sit
still for ten minutes to do it.

01:14:04.271 --> 01:14:15.582
TALIESIN: Ten minutes to heal everybody up a bit.
So that's 2d8 plus my spellcasting ability

01:14:15.582 --> 01:14:17.034
modifier?

01:14:17.034 --> 01:14:19.491
TRAVIS: That's not long enough for hit dice and
stuff though?

01:14:19.491 --> 01:14:21.458
MATT: So roll 2d8 plus your wisdom modifier.

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:22.694
TALIESIN: Oh my god, really?

01:14:22.694 --> 01:14:24.611
MATT: Double ones?

01:14:24.611 --> 01:14:25.711
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:31.170
TRAVIS: You gave the golden snitch away, Taliesin.
This is the beginning of the end.

01:14:31.170 --> 01:14:32.206
LAURA: Did he really?

01:14:32.206 --> 01:14:33.725
LIAM: He tossed it at the DM.

01:14:33.725 --> 01:14:39.236
TALIESIN: So that's nine points of healing to
everybody.

01:14:39.236 --> 01:14:41.463
MATT: Still good. All of you guys heal nine
points. That's not bad.

01:14:41.463 --> 01:14:48.057
JENNIFER: Okay, so we already added the five, but
we don't get the five?

01:14:48.057 --> 01:14:51.158
MATT: Nine on top of that.

01:14:51.158 --> 01:14:53.266
JENNIFER: Nine more on top of the five? Okay.

01:14:53.266 --> 01:15:01.028
MATT: As Bundle finishes the Prayer of Healing and
you all feel your wounds begin to close and stitch

01:15:01.028 --> 01:15:04.988
themselves together, you see a little bit of
movement at the edge of the banks. Between the

01:15:04.988 --> 01:15:12.903
rock that had plummeted into it, you watch as a
tiny hand-- Climbing out of the water you see a

01:15:12.903 --> 01:15:16.730
very bloodied, smashed, one eye swollen kobold.

01:15:16.730 --> 01:15:20.009
LAURA: Can I use Firebolt at it?

01:15:20.009 --> 01:15:25.391
TRAVIS: No! Don't you want to ask maybe what they
were doing down here, or what their plans might

01:15:25.391 --> 01:15:26.490
be?

01:15:26.490 --> 01:15:28.733
LAURA: Oh, I mean sure, if that sounds good to
you!

01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:30.576
TRAVIS: I think it might be wise.

01:15:30.576 --> 01:15:32.771
LAURA: I'm a rage monster. I just like to kill
things!

01:15:32.771 --> 01:15:34.319
TRAVIS: I know that about you.

01:15:34.319 --> 01:15:36.260
JENNIFER: That's why she's my new best friend.

01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:37.727
LAURA: Go for it.

01:15:37.727 --> 01:15:42.420
TRAVIS: Can I go over and pick it up by the back
of the neck?

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:43.661
MATT: (squeals)

01:15:43.661 --> 01:15:48.168
TRAVIS: Hello, friend. Before I let one of these
fine people--

01:15:48.168 --> 01:15:52.266
MATT: As he's scrambling right now, looking up at
the candle which is currently out because of the

01:15:52.266 --> 01:15:55.674
waterlogged, it's like (whimpers).

01:15:55.674 --> 01:16:02.741
TRAVIS: I know, a very sad face. Before one of
these fine people sends you to your maker, what

01:16:02.741 --> 01:16:04.031
were you doing in here?

01:16:04.031 --> 01:16:10.378
MATT: "Okay. Just, you friend, right? I work,
help!"

01:16:10.378 --> 01:16:14.266
TRAVIS: Yes, friend. Much more work for you,
friend.

01:16:14.266 --> 01:16:15.661
MATT: "Reeksus."

01:16:15.661 --> 01:16:17.498
TRAVIS: Wicksis.

01:16:17.498 --> 01:16:19.073
MATT: "Reeksus."

01:16:19.073 --> 01:16:20.325
TRAVIS: Reeksus.

01:16:20.325 --> 01:16:23.633
LAURA: You understand what he's saying? Because I
can't tell at all.

01:16:23.633 --> 01:16:36.200
MATT: "We sent by great King Togwaggle. Togwaggle
send us to make bigger booms! Make better tunnels

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.207
"to people town!"

01:16:38.207 --> 01:16:42.352
TRAVIS: Yes, I am aware of people town.

01:16:42.352 --> 01:16:46.437
MATT: "King Togwaggle greatest, best of all
kobolds!"

01:16:46.437 --> 01:16:52.101
LIAM: How are those tunnels coming? You've made
them, or making them?

01:16:52.101 --> 01:16:59.009
MATT: "We made and make more, by the glory of
Rakanishu and King Togwaggle."

01:16:59.009 --> 01:17:02.708
TRAVIS: King Togwaggle, is he here with you now,
close by?

01:17:02.708 --> 01:17:06.421
MATT: He looks back towards the closed door.

01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:09.677
TRAVIS: Back that way?

01:17:09.677 --> 01:17:12.612
LAURA: Does the king have all of our candles?

01:17:12.612 --> 01:17:14.159
MATT: "Lots of candles."

01:17:14.159 --> 01:17:17.179
LAURA: Lots of candles. We should talk to him.

01:17:17.179 --> 01:17:20.020
JENNIFER: How many people are with the king?

01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:24.876
MATT: "People? No people."

01:17:24.876 --> 01:17:28.020
JENNIFER: Sorry, how many of your kind are with
the king?

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:31.959
MATT: "King is not very kind either, but is good
king!"

01:17:31.959 --> 01:17:35.331
JENNIFER: Are there many kobolds with the king?

01:17:35.331 --> 01:17:36.871
MATT: "There is a few."

01:17:36.871 --> 01:17:40.047
JENNIFER: More than there were here?

01:17:40.047 --> 01:17:43.064
MATT: "Depends on the time of day."

01:17:43.064 --> 01:17:45.216
LAURA: What about now?

01:17:45.216 --> 01:17:47.507
MATT: "I don't know, we've been away for a
while."

01:17:47.507 --> 01:17:55.520
JENNIFER: When do you eat? When do the kobold
eat?

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.302
MATT: "When there is food."

01:17:57.302 --> 01:17:59.227
LAURA: I like him. Can we keep him?

01:17:59.227 --> 01:18:01.726
TRAVIS: And what would we do with him?

01:18:01.726 --> 01:18:03.135
MATT: "Do you have food to eat?"

01:18:03.135 --> 01:18:08.304
JENNIFER: Do all the kobold eat together?

01:18:08.304 --> 01:18:10.536
LAURA: I pull out some beef jerky and hand it to
him.

01:18:10.536 --> 01:18:11.915
MATT: (messy chewing)

01:18:11.915 --> 01:18:22.773
JENNIFER: There's more where that came from if you
answer the question. Are there more than those of

01:18:22.773 --> 01:18:26.242
us you see here of the kobold?

01:18:26.242 --> 01:18:33.045
MATT: "There are, but scattered. Dangerous
tunnels, find dangerous things. Wander. Avoid

01:18:33.045 --> 01:18:34.674
"them! We do."

01:18:34.674 --> 01:18:40.877
TRAVIS: Quazi, do you think maybe you could
convince him to show us safe passage?

01:18:40.877 --> 01:18:46.809
LIAM: Safe passage, convince him? Oh, yes. Bring
closer.

01:18:46.809 --> 01:18:50.296
MATT: (squeals) And you catch him as he throws
him.

01:18:50.296 --> 01:18:54.793
LIAM: Your hands, what I like about them is
they're so little (bones snapping).

01:18:54.793 --> 01:19:00.731
MATT: (yelps) Make an intimidation check. With
advantage for breaking his hands.

01:19:00.731 --> 01:19:08.153
LIAM: That's a 17.

01:19:08.153 --> 01:19:11.449
MATT: (screams and sobs)

01:19:11.449 --> 01:19:14.942
LIAM: Okay, I can do this to you five more times.

01:19:14.942 --> 01:19:16.761
MATT: "No, I only have two hands!"

01:19:16.761 --> 01:19:28.123
LIAM: I can play this game all night long, little
man. So we need to get inside. We need to be, you

01:19:28.123 --> 01:19:34.413
know, alive and not getting killed, so we would
like to keep you. She has lots of beef jerky, we

01:19:34.413 --> 01:19:38.087
could feed you. But we can't have any, what did
you call these?

01:19:38.087 --> 01:19:44.536
MATT: "Boom booms. Okay, I show you. I show you!
Don't break! No more arms left to break."

01:19:44.536 --> 01:19:47.510
LAURA: Aw, heal him, please? His poor hands!

01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:53.155
LIAM: Well let him earn it first, you know? Maybe,
20 minutes we're still alive, you have healed hand

01:19:53.155 --> 01:19:54.490
and more meat.

01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:56.941
MATT: "Okay. Put me down?"

01:19:56.941 --> 01:19:58.418
LIAM: I'm not holding you.

01:19:58.418 --> 01:19:59.585
TRAVIS: Yes, you are.

01:19:59.585 --> 01:20:05.509
LIAM: You gave him to me? I like this guy. Pat pat
pat.

01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:10.246
MATT: In the rush of combat, you didn't realize
that you were clutching him the whole time.

01:20:10.246 --> 01:20:15.191
LIAM: Well, I went like this. I thought you were
holding him. You know, Dungeons &amp; Dragons is funny

01:20:15.191 --> 01:20:22.270
thing. Your mind's different from my mind. Who
knows what we're seeing? I drop his ass on

01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:23.457
ground.

01:20:23.457 --> 01:20:25.717
MATT: "We need to go through door."

01:20:25.717 --> 01:20:28.193
JENNIFER: Should we secure him?

01:20:28.193 --> 01:20:30.207
LAURA: If you want.

01:20:30.207 --> 01:20:31.299
TALIESIN: We've got rope.

01:20:31.299 --> 01:20:36.745
TRAVIS: Just so we make sure you don't break your
other hand, she's going to make sure that you're

01:20:36.745 --> 01:20:38.284
secure.

01:20:38.284 --> 01:20:40.264
MATT: "Okay."

01:20:40.264 --> 01:20:42.501
JENNIFER: Do I need to roll something for that?

01:20:42.501 --> 01:20:45.759
MATT: No, easy enough. He waits for you-- You have
rope on you?

01:20:45.759 --> 01:20:47.004
JENNIFER: I do, I have rope.

01:20:47.004 --> 01:20:49.881
MATT: Okay, so you go ahead and you bind him up
and you have a little leash that you're holding

01:20:49.881 --> 01:20:52.518
him by. And he's like, "Okay. To the door."

01:20:52.518 --> 01:20:55.473
JENNIFER: Can I pass her the leash since he's her
pet?

01:20:55.473 --> 01:21:02.574
MATT: "Oh. Pet?" Greldamine.

01:21:02.574 --> 01:21:03.926
LAURA: What?

01:21:03.926 --> 01:21:06.565
MATT: You're having a kobold's leash handed to
you.

01:21:06.565 --> 01:21:08.510
JENNIFER: Can I pass him your leash? Would you
like to have him as a pet?

01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:10.760
LAURA: Oh, well, all right.

01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:14.665
MATT: Broken, jagged teeth, spittle drooling
down.

01:21:14.665 --> 01:21:19.133
LAURA: I don't think he's much of a pet. He's more
of a companion.

01:21:19.133 --> 01:21:22.183
MATT: "Could you light the candle?"

01:21:22.183 --> 01:21:24.280
LAURA: I will in a little bit.

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:26.754
MATT: (whines)

01:21:26.754 --> 01:21:29.283
JENNIFER: Hearts next to it.

01:21:29.283 --> 01:21:31.196
LAURA: What's your name?

01:21:31.196 --> 01:21:33.451
MATT: "Reeksus."

01:21:33.451 --> 01:21:36.083
LAURA: Reeksus. You got it.

01:21:36.083 --> 01:21:40.260
MATT: "Open door!"

01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:41.520
TRAVIS: Through the door then.

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:46.493
LIAM: And I kick him really hard in the ass. Lead
the way.

01:21:46.493 --> 01:21:49.211
MATT: The door is closed.

01:21:49.211 --> 01:21:50.278
LIAM: Lead the way.

01:21:50.278 --> 01:21:52.642
MATT: "I'm bound! You made me put rope on it!"

01:21:52.642 --> 01:21:54.977
TRAVIS: Is there a latch, a door knob?

01:21:54.977 --> 01:21:58.396
MATT: There is a handle latch and it looks like
there is a lock mechanism to it.

01:21:58.396 --> 01:22:00.780
TRAVIS: Hmm, a lock.

01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.430
JENNIFER: Whose purview is this?

01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:05.618
LIAM: That's you. You take look. Make sure it does
not explode on you.

01:22:05.618 --> 01:22:08.786
JENNIFER: I don't see any wicks. I don't see
anything explosive.

01:22:08.786 --> 01:22:12.054
MATT: Make an investigation check if you want to
check for traps.

01:22:12.054 --> 01:22:19.123
JENNIFER: Oh! 25.

01:22:19.123 --> 01:22:22.339
TALIESIN: What did you roll? Well, she rolled a
20.

01:22:22.339 --> 01:22:25.404
LAURA: That's important.

01:22:25.404 --> 01:22:30.708
MATT: Very nice. It's a lock mechanism. A
relatively simple lock. It is not trapped. So, you

01:22:30.708 --> 01:22:34.551
could easily undo this with your thieves' tools.

01:22:34.551 --> 01:22:37.126
JENNIFER: So I do something so I can do that?

01:22:37.126 --> 01:22:41.841
MATT: Yep, so you roll another d20, and then add
your proficiency modifier and your dexterity

01:22:41.841 --> 01:22:43.154
modifier.

01:22:43.154 --> 01:22:46.845
LIAM: This plus this, so plus eight to what you
roll.

01:22:46.845 --> 01:22:49.002
JENNIFER: So that is 14.

01:22:49.002 --> 01:22:57.576
MATT: Easy enough. The door unlocks, opens a bit,
and beyond that is a tunnel of darkness. An

01:22:57.576 --> 01:23:01.708
interesting smell hits you as you open it though.
Whereas inside here you have that damp,

01:23:01.708 --> 01:23:06.781
hard-water, Pirates of the Caribbean ride smell
that's in the water chamber, beyond that as the

01:23:06.781 --> 01:23:16.752
door opens this musty, almost mildewed smell hits
you. It's earthy, it's fresh, it's natural, but

01:23:16.752 --> 01:23:20.544
it's definitely an underground, familiar smell.

01:23:20.544 --> 01:23:23.729
JENNIFER: Why can we never encounter a field of
flowers?

01:23:23.729 --> 01:23:29.993
LAURA: Should I light up a rock again?

01:23:29.993 --> 01:23:37.594
TALIESIN: Oh, I can do it. So I pick up a rock and
light it up, and toss it in front of us. Just keep

01:23:37.594 --> 01:23:40.637
kicking it down.

01:23:40.637 --> 01:23:44.885
MATT: It lights up the chamber as it goes, and you
continue to walk and kick it as you push forward.

01:23:44.885 --> 01:23:52.894
The walls begin to slowly glow the further in you
go. You begin to notice that, aside from a few

01:23:52.894 --> 01:23:57.939
small crystalline areas, there are heavy bits of
fungus that are beginning to appear along these

01:23:57.939 --> 01:24:04.011
chambers. Glowing green, orange, blue mushrooms
and clusters of fungal matter that are beginning

01:24:04.011 --> 01:24:09.084
to give this faint luminescence to the interior of
the chamber. And you now very much understand

01:24:09.084 --> 01:24:17.020
where the smell was coming from. As you begin to
curve around the right side of it, the tunnel

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:22.400
widens a little broader to about 15 feet wide. The
mushrooms begin to get larger and larger, some of

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:27.423
them four feet tall or bigger. You can see large
pillar stalactites and stalagmites are meeting in

01:24:27.423 --> 01:24:31.043
the center where they give their own little
offshoots of fungus. But some of these are getting

01:24:31.043 --> 01:24:37.377
very big and the pathways are getting a little
narrow to move past until, as you turn around one

01:24:37.377 --> 01:24:42.508
of the right bends, the fungus is pushed around to
the point where it's a very narrow passage to push

01:24:42.508 --> 01:24:44.241
through these fungal forests.

01:24:44.241 --> 01:24:46.611
LIAM: I don't like mushrooms.

01:24:46.611 --> 01:24:48.601
LAURA: They're quite tasty, actually.

01:24:48.601 --> 01:24:51.629
TALIESIN: Could make a glowing salad of some
kind.

01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:53.470
LAURA: Ooh, yeah. Hey, Reeksus.

01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:55.419
MATT: "Yeah?"

01:24:55.419 --> 01:25:00.642
LAURA: I give him a little bit of beef jerky.
Okay. Do you want to go in front of us and lead

01:25:00.642 --> 01:25:02.468
the way to your king?

01:25:02.468 --> 01:25:12.756
MATT: "Okay." And he carefully turns to his side
and thins up and slowly-- with disadvantage

01:25:12.756 --> 01:25:19.213
because he's bound-- still effectively manages to
squiggle his way between the small path. And you

01:25:19.213 --> 01:25:25.477
can see he knows it pretty well, through the small
cluster of dense tall fungus safely to the other

01:25:25.477 --> 01:25:26.698
side.

01:25:26.698 --> 01:25:28.275
LAURA: Is it bad to touch it?

01:25:28.275 --> 01:25:30.511
MATT: "I would not recommend it."

01:25:30.511 --> 01:25:35.720
LIAM: And the rope is still trailing from him?

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:40.137
MATT: Yeah, it's 30 feet of slack rope. It's on
the ground over there.

01:25:40.137 --> 01:25:41.696
TRAVIS: If only we had some fire.

01:25:41.696 --> 01:25:51.790
LAURA: Oh. Do you want me to set these on fire?
Because I have some. I mean, is it safe to burn?

01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:59.418
What if it sets off a poison when they're on fire?
I've heard that burning mushrooms could get you,

01:25:59.418 --> 01:26:01.949
you know--

01:26:01.949 --> 01:26:03.830
TRAVIS: &lt;i&gt;Eating&lt;/i&gt; mushrooms.

01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:05.236
LAURA: Oh, it's not fumes?

01:26:05.236 --> 01:26:06.734
TALIESIN, LIAM and TRAVIS: No.

01:26:06.734 --> 01:26:16.388
LAURA: Oh! I wouldn't know. They don't allow that
kind of stuff at mage school. Okay! I'm going to

01:26:16.388 --> 01:26:20.866
go through! Wait, am I going to burn it? I'm going
to get to the other side and then I'm going to try

01:26:20.866 --> 01:26:26.720
to burn it. I don't want to burn Reeks. Okay. I go
to the other side.

01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:30.683
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a straight dexterity
check, please.

01:26:30.683 --> 01:26:41.949
LAURA: All right. Woo-hoo! What is that, 18 or 19?
18 plus dexterity. 21.

01:26:41.949 --> 01:26:45.992
MATT: Following suit, you deftly follow the same
pattern and come out the other side, not even

01:26:45.992 --> 01:26:54.902
touching any of the fungus with either side of your
armored shoulder pauldrons. Your mantle, I guess

01:26:54.902 --> 01:26:56.292
it would be.

01:26:56.292 --> 01:27:00.013
LAURA: Should I try to burn them now? What do you
guys think?

01:27:00.013 --> 01:27:04.705
LIAM: Depends on what we think biggest threat is.
Touching mushroom, breathing mushroom?

01:27:04.705 --> 01:27:12.634
JENNIFER: Should we test it first? Touch it to
test it to see if it affects us?

01:27:12.634 --> 01:27:16.934
TRAVIS: I'm afraid they might release spores and
then become airborne which is why I only recommend

01:27:16.934 --> 01:27:18.356
trying to burn it first.

01:27:18.356 --> 01:27:21.931
JENNIFER: That would release a lot of spores.

01:27:21.931 --> 01:27:25.372
LIAM: How far away can you cast that shit from?

01:27:25.372 --> 01:27:31.828
LAURA: It's ranged about eight. I don't know what
that means.

01:27:31.828 --> 01:27:34.011
MATT: Is this Burning Hands?

01:27:34.011 --> 01:27:35.758
LAURA: No, Fire Bolt.

01:27:35.758 --> 01:27:39.714
MATT: Oh, Fire Bolt? Oh, it's a pretty decent
range. Just a single hit, yeah.

01:27:39.714 --> 01:27:44.522
LIAM: What if we all back up to our different
sides, yeah? Get back as far as you can and we'll

01:27:44.522 --> 01:27:47.777
get way the fuck back. See what happens.

01:27:47.777 --> 01:27:50.806
LAURA: And then I'll hit it because I can do
cantrips a lot, right?

01:27:50.806 --> 01:27:52.552
MATT: Cantrips you can do as many times as you
want.

01:27:52.552 --> 01:27:54.394
LAURA: Fuck-- I mean heck yeah! I'm going to do--

01:27:54.394 --> 01:27:57.452
TRAVIS: They don't let cursing happen in mage
school either?

01:27:57.452 --> 01:27:59.998
LAURA: They don't curse in mage school. I'm sorry
about that.

01:27:59.998 --> 01:28:01.948
MATT: Yeah, they're real tough on that in
Dalaran.

01:28:01.948 --> 01:28:03.756
LAURA: They smack your hands. I'll tell you that
much.

01:28:03.756 --> 01:28:09.295
MATT: They wouldn't tell you but Madame had a
potty mouth.

01:28:09.295 --> 01:28:17.448
LAURA: I'm going to cast Fire Bolt at the
mushrooms. That gives me 2d10 fire damage.

01:28:17.448 --> 01:28:22.864
MATT: Yes, even with a singular bolt, the
mushroom's pretty big and it's not moving. It's

01:28:22.864 --> 01:28:27.578
pretty easy to hit. You hit the first one a while
away and as it impacts you watch as the flames

01:28:27.578 --> 01:28:35.300
burn up. Immediately the strange, subtle squeaking
sound releases as it shakes and shimmies. And you

01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:41.388
watch as spores filter out and then ignite from
the nearby flames that immediately destroy the

01:28:41.388 --> 01:28:45.857
cloud before it can emerge. And the fungus slowly
withers and crumples over.

01:28:45.857 --> 01:28:49.634
LAURA: Okay, good! I do the same thing on all of
the mushrooms that are along the path.

01:28:49.634 --> 01:28:58.323
MATT: Okay. One by one you create this pathway,
destroying the fungus on the opposite side. Are

01:28:58.323 --> 01:28:59.978
you still holding the rope?

01:28:59.978 --> 01:29:01.219
LAURA: Yes.

01:29:01.219 --> 01:29:03.431
MATT: Okay. As the flames begin--

01:29:03.431 --> 01:29:06.363
LAURA: But I went through, remember? I went
through and I'm holding the rope on my side.

01:29:06.363 --> 01:29:10.309
MATT: Right. So as you're destroying these the
rope pulls a little taut to your side as you begin

01:29:10.309 --> 01:29:14.412
clearing the path. And you look over and you can
see your friend is peeking around a rock. You can

01:29:14.412 --> 01:29:18.723
see this glow on the other side of a boulder
around the bend where he's looking over and looks

01:29:18.723 --> 01:29:20.652
back at you and is like--

01:29:20.652 --> 01:29:21.892
LAURA: What?

01:29:21.892 --> 01:29:23.182
MATT: (mutters)

01:29:23.182 --> 01:29:24.249
LAURA: Hold on.

01:29:24.249 --> 01:29:28.916
MATT: "Okay." The rest of you guys, there is a
path wide enough to follow through.

01:29:28.916 --> 01:29:30.601
TRAVIS: We join.

01:29:30.601 --> 01:29:32.532
LAURA: They're coming? Okay, I go over to Reek.

01:29:32.532 --> 01:29:39.168
MATT: As you guys approach you can see the small
flickering of light shift suddenly and a dark

01:29:39.168 --> 01:29:46.737
shape of a figure whips around from behind the
rock. You see a flash of cloth that floats open

01:29:46.737 --> 01:29:52.472
and then drifts down to the side as an arm
uncurls. You can see immediately wide-shouldered,

01:29:52.472 --> 01:29:59.133
a broad long trench coat that swings open to one
side, a clawed, familiar, slightly furred hand

01:29:59.133 --> 01:30:06.094
holding it open as a brownish hat, wide-brimmed,
appears with its candle placed on top of the brim.

01:30:06.094 --> 01:30:10.913
You see another kobold standing there looking at
your tied-up friend and the rest of you. And he

01:30:10.913 --> 01:30:20.585
goes, "Hey! Hey! Want to buy a fungus?" As you
look on the inside of the cloak you can see these

01:30:20.585 --> 01:30:28.478
little patchwork pouches of different gathered
mushrooms, orange, green and blue. "I sell, good

01:30:28.478 --> 01:30:30.263
"price. Come. Buy."

01:30:30.263 --> 01:30:32.201
TALIESIN: Well--

01:30:32.201 --> 01:30:34.148
LAURA: Well, what do they do?

01:30:34.148 --> 01:30:38.750
MATT: "Taste good! Ugh. Bad. Good bad. Fun!"

01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:41.129
LAURA: I don't understand what he just told me.

01:30:41.129 --> 01:30:45.162
LIAM: I mean, to begin with you're not alarmed by
us being here in the first place?

01:30:45.162 --> 01:30:47.431
MATT: "I need to make money."

01:30:47.431 --> 01:30:54.314
TALIESIN: Let's not look a gift horse in the
mouth. A gift rat. Orange?

01:30:54.314 --> 01:31:01.579
MATT: "Orange fungus. Slight citrus-y taste. Weird
fuzzy sensation. 40 gold."

01:31:01.579 --> 01:31:05.332
TALIESIN: And the other two were--

01:31:05.332 --> 01:31:06.762
TRAVIS: What about blue?

01:31:06.762 --> 01:31:11.190
MATT: "Blue fungus. 30 gold. Make for good
digestion tract."

01:31:11.190 --> 01:31:13.485
TRAVIS: I'll take the blue one.

01:31:13.485 --> 01:31:15.111
LAURA: You have that much gold?

01:31:15.111 --> 01:31:16.458
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:31:16.458 --> 01:31:18.549
MATT: You now have a helping of blue fungus.

01:31:18.549 --> 01:31:20.599
TALIESIN: What's the third?

01:31:20.599 --> 01:31:28.318
MATT: "Green fungus! 25 gold. More of the onion of
fungus family."

01:31:28.318 --> 01:31:30.160
LAURA: That's a good topping.

01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:31.636
MATT: "Yeah!"

01:31:31.636 --> 01:31:37.233
LIAM: I grab rope that is holding Reekcheeks and
bring him over. "You know this one?"

01:31:37.233 --> 01:31:44.203
MATT: "He is strange one. Don't like him. I
don't-- kobolds stay away."

01:31:44.203 --> 01:31:45.533
LIAM: Is he problem?

01:31:45.533 --> 01:31:48.399
MATT: (whispering) "I don't know."

01:31:48.399 --> 01:31:50.105
LAURA: You be nice to him!

01:31:50.105 --> 01:31:53.383
TRAVIS: It's the-- they're real--

01:31:53.383 --> 01:31:54.513
LIAM: I punch him in the eye.

01:31:54.513 --> 01:31:55.777
MATT: (cry of pain)

01:31:55.777 --> 01:31:57.505
TALIESIN: You only live once. Orange.

01:31:57.505 --> 01:31:59.268
LIAM: You've got to keep them in line with tough
love.

01:31:59.268 --> 01:32:01.252
TALIESIN: I take the orange.

01:32:01.252 --> 01:32:02.265
MATT: All righty.

01:32:02.265 --> 01:32:04.462
TRAVIS: Do I know anything about this blue fungus?

01:32:04.462 --> 01:32:05.835
MATT: Make a medicine check.

01:32:05.835 --> 01:32:08.200
LAURA: It's good for digestion I hear.

01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:09.305
TRAVIS: 16.

01:32:09.305 --> 01:32:10.517
MATT: 16, okay.

01:32:10.517 --> 01:32:13.221
TALIESIN: Oh, 20.

01:32:13.221 --> 01:32:24.971
MATT: Okay. So eating this fungus has a chance of
poisoning you, but also has the opportunity to

01:32:24.971 --> 01:32:29.869
heighten your senses and perceptive capabilities
for a short time.

01:32:29.869 --> 01:32:31.912
LAURA: Ooh, it's a gamble.

01:32:31.912 --> 01:32:34.168
TALIESIN: How about mine?

01:32:34.168 --> 01:32:36.193
MATT: So that's the orange one, you got the--

01:32:36.193 --> 01:32:37.429
TALIESIN: I have the orange.

01:32:37.429 --> 01:32:38.418
MATT: You've got the orange.

01:32:38.418 --> 01:32:39.306
LAURA: Yeah, he got the blue.

01:32:39.306 --> 01:32:43.101
MATT: He got the blue, sorry, yeah. So the blue
one has a faint possibility of poisoning you.

01:32:43.101 --> 01:32:48.699
Sorry, you're the blue. The orange one is the one
you got. So you get the heightened senses, yours

01:32:48.699 --> 01:32:52.698
has a chance of poisoning you as well and or has
the possibility of healing some hit points.

01:32:52.698 --> 01:32:55.661
TALIESIN: Down the hatch.

01:32:55.661 --> 01:32:58.811
MATT: All right, both of you make constitution
saving throws.

01:32:58.811 --> 01:33:00.538
LIAM: Give it to Mikey, he'll try anything.

01:33:00.538 --> 01:33:05.294
TRAVIS: Now, because you're next to me I have Aura
of Protection which is plus two to saves?

01:33:05.294 --> 01:33:06.517
MATT: Yeah, it would.

01:33:06.517 --> 01:33:09.946
TALIESIN: Oh, that helps because my constitution's
really low.

01:33:09.946 --> 01:33:13.812
TRAVIS: Yes! 21.

01:33:13.812 --> 01:33:15.133
TALIESIN: Eight.

01:33:15.133 --> 01:33:18.043
MATT: Okay, so you're poisoned for the next hour.

01:33:18.043 --> 01:33:26.016
The poisoned status means all of your
attacks are at disadvantage and your ability

01:33:26.016 --> 01:33:34.463
checks are at disadvantage as well. So you have
advantage on all perception and investigation

01:33:34.463 --> 01:33:36.452
checks for the next hour.

01:33:36.452 --> 01:33:38.391
LIAM: Everything is crystal clear.

01:33:38.391 --> 01:33:42.648
MATT: Yeah, your eyes dilate suddenly and I know
kung-fu.

01:33:42.648 --> 01:33:44.362
TRAVIS: Yeah! Show me.

01:33:44.362 --> 01:33:48.206
MATT: Bundle, you heal six hit points.

01:33:48.206 --> 01:33:50.946
TALIESIN: I heal six?

01:33:50.946 --> 01:33:52.544
LAURA: Ooh, at least it healed you while it
poisoned you.

01:33:52.544 --> 01:33:57.174
TALIESIN: I'm also going to cast Lesser
Restoration and make the poison go away.

01:33:57.174 --> 01:34:04.941
MATT: Okay. So the poison vanishes from your
system at which point the kobold, "Mushhuckster

01:34:04.941 --> 01:34:10.988
"Max thanks you. Now off to find new ventures!"
Pulls the cloak in front of his head and darts

01:34:10.988 --> 01:34:15.391
away on little ninja feet. Back through the
mushrooms and vanishes into darkness.

01:34:15.391 --> 01:34:19.706
TALIESIN: It's weird he's selling mushrooms to
random people in caverns like that.

01:34:19.706 --> 01:34:21.811
TRAVIS: I highly recommend the blue fungus.

01:34:21.811 --> 01:34:28.035
LIAM: In another life, I would have hit that guy
before he said a single word. I would have dropped

01:34:28.035 --> 01:34:30.294
his ass.

01:34:30.294 --> 01:34:32.139
TRAVIS: Somehow I know that to be true about you.

01:34:32.139 --> 01:34:38.494
MATT: At this point you hear a strange guttural
growl from the path that you were traveling near a

01:34:38.494 --> 01:34:43.254
pillar of stone encased in mushrooms as from
around one back of it you see a shape of a large,

01:34:43.254 --> 01:34:51.729
hunched, bestial dwarf ape-like creature standing
at about six and a half feet tall as its long arms

01:34:51.729 --> 01:34:57.637
drag on the ground. It's drooling down its own
chest. You've experienced, most of you in particular,

01:34:57.637 --> 01:35:05.302
this is a trogg, a large subterranean creature,
but this trogg is acting strange. It's giggling to

01:35:05.302 --> 01:35:11.370
itself. (deep laughter) Holds the pillar and grabs
some mushroom and scarfs it.

01:35:11.370 --> 01:35:12.121
LAURA: Oh no.

01:35:12.121 --> 01:35:13.487
JENNIFER: Here we go.

01:35:13.487 --> 01:35:23.320
MATT: (grunts) And he starts walking around the
edge, looks around the edge right to you, "It's

01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:25.144
"real?"

01:35:25.144 --> 01:35:28.594
TALIESIN, JENNIFER, and LAURA: No!

01:35:28.594 --> 01:35:30.831
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:35:30.831 --> 01:35:41.841
TALIESIN: Come on! Natural 20! About fucking time!
There we are! No!

01:35:41.841 --> 01:35:52.449
MATT: "Too weird! I see things!" You see two other
large troggs come from behind going. They're

01:35:52.449 --> 01:36:01.975
tripping balls. One of them is currently clutching
a long staff of purple and gold inlay and is

01:36:01.975 --> 01:36:06.311
gnawing on it like a large lollipop. You can't see
the top because it's jammed in his mouth. They're

01:36:06.311 --> 01:36:09.485
all looking at you going (laughing).

01:36:09.485 --> 01:36:14.162
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Thaumaturgy to make us
all look really fuzzy, in and out, if I can do

01:36:14.162 --> 01:36:15.142
that.

01:36:15.142 --> 01:36:16.251
MATT: You may.

01:36:16.251 --> 01:36:17.865
TALIESIN: Ooh!

01:36:17.865 --> 01:36:35.199
MATT: No. Okay! They all stand there and watch.
(groaning) One of them picks his nose slowly.

01:36:35.199 --> 01:36:38.221
TALIESIN: I hadn't thought this through.

01:36:38.221 --> 01:36:42.245
LAURA: I use Prestidigitation and create light
flares around him.

01:36:42.245 --> 01:36:47.200
MATT: One elbows one in the chin, the guy who was
holding the staff, he elbows him the chest.

01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:55.553
(gagging) Pulls it out. You can see on the top of
the staff, it has these awesome, pointed purple

01:36:55.553 --> 01:37:02.829
stones, three of them in a triangular pattern that
float, locked into place. (licking) Jams it back

01:37:02.829 --> 01:37:04.918
in his mouth and begins chewing on it again.

01:37:04.918 --> 01:37:12.282
TALIESIN: Can I make the staff look like it's made
of snakes or something? Can I Thaumaturgy?

01:37:12.282 --> 01:37:15.870
MATT: Unfortunately, that's an illusion spell.
Thaumaturgy is very simple. It's a very faint

01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:19.917
effect that wouldn't have an effect if they
weren't already tripping balls.

01:37:19.917 --> 01:37:22.049
LAURA: If they're already tripping can we say:
Whoa, why are you holding that snake in your

01:37:22.049 --> 01:37:23.540
hand?

01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:26.873
MATT: Make a persuasion check!

01:37:26.873 --> 01:37:35.010
LAURA: Please! Oh no, 11.

01:37:35.010 --> 01:37:41.488
MATT: 11. He goes (gags). Pulls it out, looks at
it, "Hey, a snake!" and begins trying to bite

01:37:41.488 --> 01:37:44.136
through. You watch as his teeth are breaking on
the metal.

01:37:44.136 --> 01:37:50.740
TRAVIS: I'll cast Command on him and say: drop
that wicked snake!

01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:56.758
MATT: Okay! What's your spell DC?

01:37:56.758 --> 01:37:58.098
TRAVIS: 13.

01:37:58.098 --> 01:38:08.848
MATT: He rolled a 13 minus one. This trogg is not
very wise. Drops it. You see he's putting his

01:38:08.848 --> 01:38:12.734
tongue through his mouth and bits of teeth are
falling out of his lips and bouncing off of his

01:38:12.734 --> 01:38:21.246
belly. (grunts) They're all currently entranced by
the movement and the lights that you've created.

01:38:21.246 --> 01:38:26.578
JENNIFER: I'd love to collect the thing.

01:38:26.578 --> 01:38:30.759
MATT: Make a stealth check to see if you can not
gather their gaze as they're currently entranced

01:38:30.759 --> 01:38:31.837
by this.

01:38:31.837 --> 01:38:34.587
TRAVIS: We're doing our best outside inflatable
people.

01:38:34.587 --> 01:38:35.946
JENNIFER: 21.

01:38:35.946 --> 01:38:43.582
MATT: 21. You slowly, subtly go beneath their
eyeline, slip out, and pull the staff away as

01:38:43.582 --> 01:38:50.710
they're all still (gasping). One of them begins
picking his ear, pulls something out, and eats

01:38:50.710 --> 01:38:51.710
it.

01:38:51.710 --> 01:38:53.341
(groaning)

01:38:53.341 --> 01:38:55.208
LAURA: We should back away slowly.

01:38:55.208 --> 01:38:56.959
MATT: (farts)

01:38:56.959 --> 01:39:00.595
TALIESIN: Oh, slowly. Okay!

01:39:00.595 --> 01:39:04.825
LAURA: Reeks, if we leave them, will you keep
guiding the way?

01:39:04.825 --> 01:39:12.235
MATT: "Behind them? The way is where they came
from."

01:39:12.235 --> 01:39:18.973
TRAVIS: Quazi? Feel like introducing yourself?

01:39:18.973 --> 01:39:32.566
LIAM: Good news, my brothers. We come from both
the future and the past.

01:39:32.566 --> 01:39:35.695
MATT: All three of them (grunt).

01:39:35.695 --> 01:39:40.942
LIAM: Let me tell you. Your fathers are proud of
you.

01:39:40.942 --> 01:39:50.739
MATT: The two on the sides look in to the one in
the center who goes, "You know father?"

01:39:50.739 --> 01:40:02.839
LIAM: I've been this fucked up before. Your
mothers love you and are proud of you!

01:40:02.839 --> 01:40:05.717
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:40:05.717 --> 01:40:15.302
LIAM: Persuasion, you said. That's 18.

01:40:15.302 --> 01:40:22.577
MATT: 18? His giant, meaty, fur-covered hands clap
onto your shoulders of your armor and pulls you in

01:40:22.577 --> 01:40:28.212
close. You can smell the horrible trogg breath
billow out across your face. Almost thickens the

01:40:28.212 --> 01:40:33.969
air around you. It smells of rotting meat and a
multitude of terrible memories.

01:40:33.969 --> 01:40:41.580
LIAM: And the deep secret is: You know that I am
you.

01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:52.257
MATT: He releases you and takes a step back and
goes. (sobbing) And starts sobbing openly. The two

01:40:52.257 --> 01:40:56.493
other troggs clap the side of his shoulders and
start sobbing, too. The three of them sit in place

01:40:56.493 --> 01:41:02.566
and start having the most basic of existential
crises you could watch.

01:41:02.566 --> 01:41:05.638
TALIESIN: Slowly making our way around the
existential crisis.

01:41:05.638 --> 01:41:08.923
MATT: The rest of you make a stealth check. You
already made one. The rest of you make a stealth

01:41:08.923 --> 01:41:10.041
check.

01:41:10.041 --> 01:41:18.550
LIAM: Doing inches this way like an arc. And Papa
and Mama don't want you to hurt you! You have to

01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:21.739
love you!

01:41:21.739 --> 01:41:27.980
MATT: You get the sense they're picking up every
third word due to the limits of their language

01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:41.128
comprehension. They're like, (grunting) "Love!
(grunting) Ove! (sobbing) Guh!" They're just

01:41:41.128 --> 01:41:42.867
making guttural noises at this point.

01:41:42.867 --> 01:41:44.117
LIAM: Give into it.

01:41:44.117 --> 01:41:45.557
MATT: Make a stealth check, please.

01:41:45.557 --> 01:41:49.427
LIAM: Oh, that's a 20!

01:41:49.427 --> 01:42:00.793
MATT: As you guys slowly curve around the three
sobbing troggs, staff in hand, you exit through

01:42:00.793 --> 01:42:06.328
the tunnel they had passed through. The fungus
begins to give way as the heat begins to rise

01:42:06.328 --> 01:42:10.902
steadily once you traverse further into this
tunnel. You're holding the staff. As you're

01:42:10.902 --> 01:42:23.529
walking, looking over it, a slow voice beings to
peek in seemingly from nowhere. It says, "Oh,

01:42:23.529 --> 01:42:31.084
"wondrous. Another unworthy soul. I command you to
throw me into a river and be done with it."

01:42:31.084 --> 01:42:37.646
JENNIFER: Hmm. First, you must tell us your
secrets.

01:42:37.646 --> 01:42:42.866
MATT: "I require a wielder who walks the path of
power, fool."

01:42:42.866 --> 01:42:44.695
LAURA: What's it saying?

01:42:44.695 --> 01:42:49.017
JENNIFER: It requires a wielder who walks the path
of power, fool.

01:42:49.017 --> 01:42:50.037
LAURA: Magic?

01:42:50.037 --> 01:42:52.507
JENNIFER: I'm not calling you a fool, it's calling
you a fool. Magic.

01:42:52.507 --> 01:42:55.267
LAURA: I do magic!

01:42:55.267 --> 01:42:57.242
JENNIFER: Take him.

01:42:57.242 --> 01:43:04.985
MATT: As you take the staff, it warms to your
touch. For a moment, there's an awkward silence

01:43:04.985 --> 01:43:08.544
of: did she actually hear anything, or has your
friend been crazy the whole time you've been

01:43:08.544 --> 01:43:09.703
traveling?

01:43:09.703 --> 01:43:11.192
JENNIFER: Both.

01:43:11.192 --> 01:43:23.025
MATT: A voice slowly echoes in, "Ah, you! You have
potential. A withered seed that could blossom into

01:43:23.025 --> 01:43:25.026
"a tyrant of the arcane."

01:43:25.026 --> 01:43:27.786
LAURA: Well, I'm pretty blossomed already, but
okay.

01:43:27.786 --> 01:43:37.501
MATT: "Yes. You will do. I am Aluneth and
together, we will do great things." And that's

01:43:37.501 --> 01:43:39.200
where we're going to take a break.

01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:44.110
TRAVIS: Ooh! You've got sentient weapons in this
thing! The little gems are floating in a

01:43:44.110 --> 01:43:44.860
triangle?

01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:47.481
MATT: They're held aloft by some mystical power.

01:43:47.481 --> 01:43:49.063
LAURA: Fancy!

01:43:49.063 --> 01:43:50.347
MATT: I'll show you pictures of it.

01:43:50.347 --> 01:43:53.900
TRAVIS: Nicely done! Your baptism is going well!

01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:56.785
JENNIFER: Sorry about trying the narrative thing!
I was like: Oh shit!

01:43:56.785 --> 01:44:00.333
MATT: No, it's all good! First time in, you just
figure it out. You're doing great.

01:44:00.333 --> 01:44:03.611
JENNIFER: Oh, there's a wall there!

01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:07.208
MATT: Thank you guys so much. We're going to to go
break. We'll be back in a few minutes. Rest, get

01:44:07.208 --> 01:44:13.675
drinks. We have some fun stuff at the break for
you to watch. You get to check out, if you haven't

01:44:13.675 --> 01:44:18.640
seen it, the song I sing for this expansion.
Pretty sure it's coming up.

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:21.691
LAURA: Notebooks in the store!

01:44:21.691 --> 01:44:22.802
MATT: Yep!

01:44:22.802 --> 01:44:23.838
JENNIFER: Where's the notebook?

01:44:23.838 --> 01:44:25.338
LIAM: Show the Feywild!

01:44:25.338 --> 01:44:28.587
TALIESIN: Now I want to do Russian now.

01:44:28.587 --> 01:44:30.970
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes. We'll
see you then.

01:44:30.970 --> 01:52:00.228
[break]

01:52:00.228 --> 01:52:07.988
MATT: Welcome back, everybody. Before we dive in,
the winner of the Wyrmwood giveaway is

01:52:07.988 --> 01:52:15.411
flashfletch33. So congratulations, flashfletch33.
Danoba will get your contact info and we'll get

01:52:15.411 --> 01:52:26.270
that off to you ASAP. Also, I was just notified
that the chat had discovered: back when vanilla

01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:29.434
launch happened, I was one of the people waiting
at the midnight launch of World of Warcraft

01:52:29.434 --> 01:52:36.829
outside of a cold Best Buy in Irvine many years
ago, and started my long trek on the RP server

01:52:36.829 --> 01:52:43.458
Silverhand at launch. I discovered today via
fatalcake23 in the chat that there is both a Vox

01:52:43.458 --> 01:52:50.506
Machina and a Slayer's Take guild on the server I
started on, which is so weird and full circle.

01:52:50.506 --> 01:52:52.432
Yeah, we used to play on that server.

01:52:52.432 --> 01:52:54.080
TALIESIN: Yeah, you dragged me onto Silverhand!

01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:57.321
MATT: Yeah, so that's kind of cool. So hi,
everybody on Silverhand and those guilds and

01:52:57.321 --> 01:52:58.603
beyond.

01:52:58.603 --> 01:53:01.104
TALIESIN and MATT: It's been a while.

01:53:01.104 --> 01:53:04.979
LIAM: We are such fake nerds.

01:53:04.979 --> 01:53:06.942
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Totes fake.

01:53:06.942 --> 01:53:08.665
TRAVIS: I just want to go deadlift right now.

01:53:08.665 --> 01:53:09.973
JENNIFER: I aspire to nerd.

01:53:09.973 --> 01:53:11.410
MATT: You aspire what?

01:53:11.410 --> 01:53:12.621
JENNIFER: I aspire to nerd.

01:53:12.621 --> 01:53:15.993
MATT: All right. So as we come back in, you have
acquired--

01:53:15.993 --> 01:53:21.556
LAURA: Yay! Should I read it out loud?

01:53:21.556 --> 01:53:22.696
MATT: If you'd like to.

01:53:22.696 --> 01:53:28.741
LAURA: I have acquired Aluneth. "This ancient,
extremely powerful staff was once owned by

01:53:28.741 --> 01:53:32.555
"Aegwynn." Egwin. Agewin.

01:53:32.555 --> 01:53:33.845
MATT: Sure.

01:53:33.845 --> 01:53:39.915
LAURA: "The only female guardian of Tirisfal. This
staff carries a mind far more ancient than most

01:53:39.915 --> 01:53:46.613
"things in Azeroth." My spell attack rolls gain a
+3 to hit. Whenever I deal damage, I deal two

01:53:46.613 --> 01:53:51.570
additional hit points of force damage. That's
amazing.

01:53:51.570 --> 01:53:58.601
MATT: As you're clutching the staff, as it speaks
to you in your mind: "Together, we will do great

01:53:58.601 --> 01:54:07.059
"things. But you must survive. So: be smart. Stay
alive. And perhaps ditch these unnecessary

01:54:07.059 --> 01:54:08.476
"dregs."

01:54:08.476 --> 01:54:11.413
LAURA: They're pretty cool, actually. Well, some
of them.

01:54:11.413 --> 01:54:12.577
TRAVIS: Who's cool?

01:54:12.577 --> 01:54:13.750
LAURA: What?

01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:15.062
TALIESIN: Well, I'm cool.

01:54:15.062 --> 01:54:15.999
LAURA: What are you talking about?

01:54:15.999 --> 01:54:17.656
LIAM: What are you doing? Did you eat mushrooms?

01:54:17.656 --> 01:54:19.065
TRAVIS: You said "They're pretty cool."

01:54:19.065 --> 01:54:21.303
LIAM: You were talking out loud to no one.

01:54:21.303 --> 01:54:24.596
LAURA: Oh, no! It's the staff! It has a voice!

01:54:24.596 --> 01:54:27.039
JENNIFER: What did it say? I heard it.

01:54:27.039 --> 01:54:33.210
LAURA: It said that I'm really amazing and that
I'm going to do good things. I think that it's

01:54:33.210 --> 01:54:39.206
like a really powerful weapon. It's like the kind
of thing you take with you for several levels at

01:54:39.206 --> 01:54:40.229
least.

01:54:40.229 --> 01:54:42.189
TALIESIN: How did we agree that you get the epic
loot drop?

01:54:42.189 --> 01:54:43.488
TRAVIS: Staff of flirting.

01:54:43.488 --> 01:54:46.682
JENNIFER: He wouldn't speak to me. I'm too tall.

01:54:46.682 --> 01:54:48.620
LAURA: That's probably what it is.

01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:52.063
LIAM: I think it's your own positive nature,
speaking to you from yourself.

01:54:52.063 --> 01:54:57.069
LAURA: That's possible. My mama and papa are very
proud of me.

01:54:57.069 --> 01:55:00.450
LIAM: I mean, that's up to you and them. I don't
know shit about that.

01:55:00.450 --> 01:55:02.284
JENNIFER: Is he you?

01:55:02.284 --> 01:55:04.514
LAURA: Is it a he? I don't know.

01:55:04.514 --> 01:55:06.868
JENNIFER: Is &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; you?

01:55:06.868 --> 01:55:09.566
LAURA: Oh, him? Not staff. I'm confused.

01:55:09.566 --> 01:55:15.000
MATT: Your perceptive Night Elf sense picks out
the air becoming more sulfurous as you progress.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:21.711
You all begin to feel a bit uncomfortable in your
armor as the temperature gets warmer and warmer.

01:55:21.711 --> 01:55:30.530
As this tunnel descends slightly and then comes to
an abrupt leveling point, you can see a faint

01:55:30.530 --> 01:55:36.778
orange glow begin to fill the chamber before you
as the pathway opens up to a large, cavernous

01:55:36.778 --> 01:55:44.867
dome. The floor of this new chamber is cracked,
with dark soot, and brittle, black rock. The room

01:55:44.867 --> 01:55:51.017
seems to maintain its own atmospheric,
reddish-orange glow across the entirety of the

01:55:51.017 --> 01:55:58.674
roof. Roughly 30 feet into this chamber, you get a
glance at the source of light as the rocky floor

01:55:58.674 --> 01:56:04.934
suddenly drops off into a river of roiling, molten
magma. The heat at this point is extremely

01:56:04.934 --> 01:56:10.349
intense, causing you to squint as you back away
from the edge. There's a series of pillars that

01:56:10.349 --> 01:56:18.458
rise from the lava into platforms. In fact, it
looks like at one point, two wide stone bridges

01:56:18.458 --> 01:56:24.841
that were perpendicular, meeting in the center,
once reached across this lava field, both from

01:56:24.841 --> 01:56:29.894
where you stand and then one on two opposite ends
of this cavern, where you can see openings on the

01:56:29.894 --> 01:56:34.992
opposite end to the right of where you are, and
then to the left, it appears a portion of it has

01:56:34.992 --> 01:56:39.876
collapsed and closed it off. These bridges,
however, through time and erosion, have fallen in

01:56:39.876 --> 01:56:45.029
parts. And to give you a visual perspective of
what you're glancing at, you entered from this

01:56:45.029 --> 01:56:51.221
chamber. These are the existing platforms still.
The shaded elements represent ones that are down

01:56:51.221 --> 01:56:56.913
in the lava, and resting there. There's a slight
alcove over here, there's a number of dotted bits

01:56:56.913 --> 01:57:02.348
here and here, this appears to have collapsed, and
there's an opening here and an opening here.

01:57:02.348 --> 01:57:04.538
You're currently on this platform.

01:57:04.538 --> 01:57:12.569
TALIESIN: See, this would have been an appropriate
place to build bridges that are kind of iffy. Two

01:57:12.569 --> 01:57:14.118
of them, even.

01:57:14.118 --> 01:57:17.318
LAURA: Yeah. Hey, Reeks?

01:57:17.318 --> 01:57:18.841
MATT: "What?"

01:57:18.841 --> 01:57:20.887
LAURA: Which direction is your king?

01:57:20.887 --> 01:57:27.967
MATT: "Uh--" And he bends forward and tries to get
one hand up, and the finger goes like--

01:57:27.967 --> 01:57:33.771
LAURA: Hey, look! Your hands are working again!

01:57:33.771 --> 01:57:36.765
MATT: "Ow!"

01:57:36.765 --> 01:57:44.119
(laughter)

01:57:44.119 --> 01:57:46.026
LIAM: Mind over matter.

01:57:46.026 --> 01:57:50.648
MATT: "They mostly just let me through."

01:57:50.648 --> 01:57:54.039
LAURA: Oh, Okay, well, we'll figure it out.

01:57:54.039 --> 01:57:57.028
TRAVIS: Now, now, you know King Tagwaggle will be
very disappointed--

01:57:57.028 --> 01:57:58.331
MATT: "&lt;i&gt;Togwaggle!&lt;/i&gt;"

01:57:58.331 --> 01:58:03.012
TRAVIS: Togwaggle will be very disappointed if we
are not brought before him.

01:58:03.012 --> 01:58:14.051
MATT: "Wait. Across." And the finger, the broken
hand, tries to lift up. "Across. I remember! That

01:58:14.051 --> 01:58:16.042
"way. That way to Togwaggle."

01:58:16.042 --> 01:58:17.850
LAURA: Straight across?

01:58:17.850 --> 01:58:18.715
MATT: "Yes."

01:58:18.715 --> 01:58:26.022
TALIESIN: I want to take a quick insight check and
give him an eye. I don't trust this one. That's

01:58:26.022 --> 01:58:28.398
not bad. That's a 16.

01:58:28.398 --> 01:58:42.334
MATT: 16? Kind of hard to read. You get the sense
that something doesn't sit right with the way he's

01:58:42.334 --> 01:58:43.739
saying it.

01:58:43.739 --> 01:58:53.484
LIAM: Aerwin, do you see anything hinky in this
room? Anything off? Bad?

01:58:53.484 --> 01:58:55.447
MATT: You can make a perception check if you
like.

01:58:55.447 --> 01:58:56.910
JENNIFER: I'd like to make a perception check.

01:58:56.910 --> 01:58:59.298
TRAVIS: Can I join her with my heightened senses
from my blue fungi?

01:58:59.298 --> 01:59:01.374
MATT: You may. With advantage.

01:59:01.374 --> 01:59:07.209
LIAM: What's that? Okay, that's 16, plus
perception.

01:59:07.209 --> 01:59:09.256
JENNIFER: So, 23.

01:59:09.256 --> 01:59:10.569
TRAVIS: 18.

01:59:10.569 --> 01:59:17.142
MATT: All right. So as you both glance over, you
notice the part that's collapsed and taken down

01:59:17.142 --> 01:59:22.005
that portion of the bridge, there is no way
through. It is completely sealed off. You both

01:59:22.005 --> 01:59:27.458
notice simultaneously, on the central cross
platform in the center of the chamber, where you

01:59:27.458 --> 01:59:32.451
see across the broken center there's a bunch of
scraps of metal. Empty shells of armor

01:59:32.451 --> 01:59:38.906
plates that have been left there and have long
been covered in dust and soot. &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; notice with

01:59:38.906 --> 01:59:45.359
your fair vision that the small alcove on the far
end of the upper corner that's down near the

01:59:45.359 --> 01:59:53.592
surface of the lava, it appears to be two figures
lying down in the shadows there. You can't make

01:59:53.592 --> 01:59:58.745
out much more detail than that, but there appears
to be two humanoid entities that are currently

01:59:58.745 --> 02:00:01.341
resting on that platform.

02:00:01.341 --> 02:00:05.798
LAURA: They're laying a trap. I'll bet you
anything.

02:00:05.798 --> 02:00:07.475
JENNIFER: We need to get closer.

02:00:07.475 --> 02:00:09.302
TALIESIN: With darkvision, could I see them?

02:00:09.302 --> 02:00:12.317
MATT: At this distance, no. You'll probably have
to get closer to the central platform to get a

02:00:12.317 --> 02:00:13.324
better view.

02:00:13.324 --> 02:00:19.626
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to try and go for
the central platform.

02:00:19.626 --> 02:00:27.702
LAURA: Wait! But you just said there's a big pile
of metal in the middle, and two creatures hiding!

02:00:27.702 --> 02:00:31.173
What if they're waiting to explode the middle?

02:00:31.173 --> 02:00:33.970
LIAM: And we're standing here talking in this
chamber.

02:00:33.970 --> 02:00:39.433
JENNIFER: Could I take some of my ball bearings
and go across? I have my ball bearings in my

02:00:39.433 --> 02:00:43.080
pocket to trip them, and go across and try to get
closer.

02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:45.859
MATT: You could throw them out in front of you to
try and see if it hits them.

02:00:45.859 --> 02:00:49.373
JENNIFER: No, I'll have them with me in case I
need them as a defense. Can I sneak across to see

02:00:49.373 --> 02:00:50.471
them?

02:00:50.471 --> 02:00:53.903
MATT: Okay. So you pull out your small pouch of
ball bearings, hold them in your hand. Go and make

02:00:53.903 --> 02:00:55.455
a stealth check.

02:00:55.455 --> 02:00:59.540
LIAM: That's good. You're going to be good.

02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:00.990
JENNIFER: 23.

02:01:00.990 --> 02:01:06.138
MATT: That's not bad. You have to leap across to
get to the smaller platform that's going up,

02:01:06.138 --> 02:01:12.799
because there are the breaks in it. What's your
strength? Ten?

02:01:12.799 --> 02:01:14.196
JENNIFER: Zero.

02:01:14.196 --> 02:01:18.440
MATT: Right, so maximum ten. So you get about a
10-foot jump across that way. It's about a 10-foot

02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:25.003
jump to get to that smaller platform. You, keeping
low, using the balls of your feet, make a leap for

02:01:25.003 --> 02:01:30.216
it, just catching the edge ever so carefully. If
you can make an acrobatics check to use your

02:01:30.216 --> 02:01:32.166
momentum to tumble onto it.

02:01:32.166 --> 02:01:37.594
LIAM: Acrobatics, you say?

02:01:37.594 --> 02:01:39.265
JENNIFER: 12 total.

02:01:39.265 --> 02:01:46.008
MATT: 12! Okay. You barely use your momentum to
not tumble backward towards the molten rock below.

02:01:46.008 --> 02:01:50.964
Using your shoulder, you roll, and using your
momentum you come to the other side of that and

02:01:50.964 --> 02:01:58.164
leap a second time towards that other side of that
platform. I need you to make one more check for

02:01:58.164 --> 02:01:59.323
me.

02:01:59.323 --> 02:02:03.837
JENNIFER: 13.

02:02:03.837 --> 02:02:10.616
MATT: 13. All right. So you leap, tumble, and you
make your way across the platform. As you stand

02:02:10.616 --> 02:02:18.235
there, looking around, you get a quick glance down
into that little alcove below as you take in the

02:02:18.235 --> 02:02:23.880
circumstance. You see there, there are two
figures. They are armored, they are lying down,

02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:31.180
and they are skeletal. They are long burned away.
The flesh is gone. They long died there. Either

02:02:31.180 --> 02:02:38.062
they were trapped and couldn't find a way out and
slowly starved or dehydrated, but there's nothing

02:02:38.062 --> 02:02:45.752
but a pile of their equipment, their weapons,
their armor, and bone. At this point, the floor

02:02:45.752 --> 02:02:53.107
below you gently rumbles a bit, and you watch as
some of the metal scraps scrape across the ground

02:02:53.107 --> 02:03:01.802
on their own. They leap up into the air and form
bracers, some sort of large, thick pieces of

02:03:01.802 --> 02:03:08.779
armor, separate, as molten rock shoots up and
flame ignites, filling the center of the empty

02:03:08.779 --> 02:03:15.180
armor into a large, elemental-like enemy made of
fire and magma within the armor. You watch as this

02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:21.155
magma rager, appearing, giving this flexing roar,
goes charging towards you. What are you doing?

02:03:21.155 --> 02:03:23.958
JENNIFER: Am I doing this?

02:03:23.958 --> 02:03:27.457
MATT: Well, you're definitely not hidden from it
yet. You have to hide first.

02:03:27.457 --> 02:03:32.388
JENNIFER: Okay. Strength is not my thing. I think
I'm going to run.

02:03:32.388 --> 02:03:39.924
MATT: Okay. So you run back the opposite
direction, leap, head across the way. Go ahead and

02:03:39.924 --> 02:03:41.358
make an acrobatics check.

02:03:41.358 --> 02:03:43.704
JENNIFER: 22.

02:03:43.704 --> 02:03:47.450
MATT: Fine. You spin, roll off your shoulder,
leap, a second time on the other side, and make

02:03:47.450 --> 02:03:48.899
one more acrobatics check.

02:03:48.899 --> 02:03:52.183
JENNIFER: 16.

02:03:52.183 --> 02:03:55.753
MATT: Not a problem. You make it across to the
other side and you watch as this large, raging

02:03:55.753 --> 02:04:02.984
elemental stops at the edge, scoots back, and
stands there, waiting, on the center platform.

02:04:02.984 --> 02:04:06.259
JENNIFER: Well, at least now we know.

02:04:06.259 --> 02:04:11.110
LAURA: That's intimidating. What about the two
things laying in wait? Were they setting a trap?

02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:14.075
JENNIFER: They were skeletons. They were done.
They were dead.

02:04:14.075 --> 02:04:15.209
LAURA: They were undead?

02:04:15.209 --> 02:04:16.220
JENNIFER: They're dead.

02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:17.094
LAURA: Just dead.

02:04:17.094 --> 02:04:18.270
JENNIFER: They were regular dead.

02:04:18.270 --> 02:04:23.283
LIAM: Well, that's iffy. You know. But also
tempting. Because what did they have when they

02:04:23.283 --> 02:04:24.543
died?

02:04:24.543 --> 02:04:25.950
LAURA: We should definitely check it out.

02:04:25.950 --> 02:04:27.316
LIAM: I can chuck you over.

02:04:27.316 --> 02:04:30.106
LAURA: But there's a giant flame monster.

02:04:30.106 --> 02:04:32.050
LIAM: Well, yeah. First one thing, then the
other.

02:04:32.050 --> 02:04:34.001
LAURA: How are we going to beat him?

02:04:34.001 --> 02:04:35.479
TRAVIS: I could stun him.

02:04:35.479 --> 02:04:37.402
LAURA: You think that would work?

02:04:37.402 --> 02:04:40.020
TRAVIS: Might. We'd have to be fast. And no one
could fall.

02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:44.651
LIAM: I'm not going to fall.

02:04:44.651 --> 02:04:46.187
TRAVIS: Why did you think I was saying that you
would fall?

02:04:46.187 --> 02:04:47.239
LIAM: You were staring straight at me.

02:04:47.239 --> 02:04:48.150
TRAVIS: Was I?

02:04:48.150 --> 02:04:49.018
LIAM: Oh, yes.

02:04:49.018 --> 02:04:50.201
TRAVIS: One of us could fall.

02:04:50.201 --> 02:04:51.775
LIAM: Now you seem sarcastic, because you're
rolling your eyes.

02:04:51.775 --> 02:04:58.821
LAURA: I'm not very good at jumping, but I can
cast Fly on myself.

02:04:58.821 --> 02:05:02.863
JENNIFER: (gasps) She is invisible. She has
invisibility.

02:05:02.863 --> 02:05:08.864
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think we have to get to-- did you
trust Skeever?

02:05:08.864 --> 02:05:10.654
LAURA: Reeks?

02:05:10.654 --> 02:05:11.688
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:05:11.688 --> 02:05:16.311
LAURA: Well... Hey, that's a good point. Reeks?

02:05:16.311 --> 02:05:17.748
MATT: "Yes?"

02:05:17.748 --> 02:05:20.601
LAURA: Why didn't you warn us about the giant
monster in the middle there?

02:05:20.601 --> 02:05:22.972
MATT: "Sorry, I forgot."

02:05:22.972 --> 02:05:24.263
LAURA: Did you?

02:05:24.263 --> 02:05:25.162
MATT: "Yes."

02:05:25.162 --> 02:05:26.750
LAURA: What happened to your voice?

02:05:26.750 --> 02:05:28.084
MATT: "What?"

02:05:28.084 --> 02:05:38.319
JENNIFER: Did they die from the monster in the
middle because they are on the far side? Or did

02:05:38.319 --> 02:05:41.782
they die trying to get out that entrance because
it is not really an entrance?

02:05:41.782 --> 02:05:50.840
LAURA: That's deep. Maybe they just fell, and they
couldn't climb back up.

02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:56.715
TRAVIS: They had to have gotten there for a
reason, right?

02:05:56.715 --> 02:05:59.421
LIAM: There are these big bruisers floating there,
staring at us.

02:05:59.421 --> 02:06:00.853
MATT: Just staring at you, yeah.

02:06:00.853 --> 02:06:02.043
LIAM: You can fly.

02:06:02.043 --> 02:06:02.962
LAURA: Yeah!

02:06:02.962 --> 02:06:07.395
LIAM: I have seen you do it so many times. Can't
you skirt the edge of this room and go over there?

02:06:07.395 --> 02:06:08.686
You don't need to go through this guy.

02:06:08.686 --> 02:06:10.112
LAURA: Over to the alcove?

02:06:10.112 --> 02:06:14.442
LIAM: Sure, see if there is anything worth, you
know. This is what we live for.

02:06:14.442 --> 02:06:16.043
LAURA: I can try.

02:06:16.043 --> 02:06:19.335
TRAVIS: Fly fly away. Fly far away.

02:06:19.335 --> 02:06:23.257
LIAM: I am not going, too much hassle.

02:06:23.257 --> 02:06:29.913
MATT: "Be careful. It's dangerous. Big fire
thing."

02:06:29.913 --> 02:06:33.306
LAURA: Okay. What did you say?

02:06:33.306 --> 02:06:34.960
MATT: "Big fire thing."

02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:37.266
LAURA: Yeah, how do you make him go back to
sleep?

02:06:37.266 --> 02:06:39.596
MATT: "Don't let him know you came."

02:06:39.596 --> 02:06:46.041
LAURA: Okay. Tell you what, Lohkor. Will you hold
his leash, please?

02:06:46.041 --> 02:06:47.572
TRAVIS: Sure!

02:06:47.572 --> 02:06:53.830
LAURA: I'm going to fly! I know exactly how to do
it.

02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:57.732
MATT: You cast it on yourself. It's a
concentration for I believe up to an hour?

02:06:57.732 --> 02:06:59.048
LAURA: Ten minutes!

02:06:59.048 --> 02:07:00.468
MATT: Ten minutes. Even better.

02:07:00.468 --> 02:07:04.083
LAURA: Sure, yeah, I'm going to fly. And I'm going
to try to go over to that little alcove and see

02:07:04.083 --> 02:07:05.235
what happens.

02:07:05.235 --> 02:07:08.461
MATT: All right. So you watch as the tiny gnome
suddenly takes off and begins gliding across the

02:07:08.461 --> 02:07:11.874
roof of this magma area.

02:07:11.874 --> 02:07:14.191
LAURA: And I'm giving the creature a wide berth.

02:07:14.191 --> 02:07:15.945
LIAM: Look, Laura, you're finally doing it.

02:07:15.945 --> 02:07:24.192
MATT: As you're doing it, you watch as the magma
rager stares and tracks her as she goes. And as

02:07:24.192 --> 02:07:29.949
you head across the way, it shifts to the very
edge of the platform, almost tensing at the border

02:07:29.949 --> 02:07:35.285
and watches as you slowly descend towards this
platform. As you come down, make a perception

02:07:35.285 --> 02:07:36.834
check.

02:07:36.834 --> 02:07:41.790
LAURA: 17.

02:07:41.790 --> 02:07:47.387
MATT: Glancing, you look down. Yeah, they are
charred and long dead. The armor appears to be

02:07:47.387 --> 02:07:51.121
burned away. There are a few pieces of equipment
that have lasted okay, although covered in black

02:07:51.121 --> 02:07:55.736
soot. There's a couple of small satchels that are
left there and looks like they were back to back.

02:07:55.736 --> 02:07:59.494
Just hoping for help or trying to find a way off,
and eventually, they expired.

02:07:59.494 --> 02:08:04.871
LAURA: I'm sorry you had a tragic ending. I'm
going to keep flying around them. I don't want to

02:08:04.871 --> 02:08:09.289
touch my feet to the ground, in case something
comes out of the ground. But I'm going to dig

02:08:09.289 --> 02:08:11.508
through all of their shit and see what I can find.

02:08:11.508 --> 02:08:13.198
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:08:13.198 --> 02:08:17.119
TRAVIS: Wow. One.

02:08:17.119 --> 02:08:23.731
LAURA: Goodbye.

02:08:23.731 --> 02:08:33.938
MATT: Okay. Glancing through, most of it falls
apart as you grasp it. The armor crumples and

02:08:33.938 --> 02:08:39.493
falls apart as you touch the armor. The only thing
that catches your attention because it is the one

02:08:39.493 --> 02:08:44.111
piece of equipment that is shining amongst the
rest, is in one of the sheaths. There is a blade,

02:08:44.111 --> 02:08:49.172
that as you pull it out, it's got this beautifully
wicked metal that curves into a point at the end,

02:08:49.172 --> 02:08:54.659
like a forked point. It's got a bit of an energy
pulse gem in the center of where the hilt is. And

02:08:54.659 --> 02:09:00.719
as you reach over to look at it, it looks pristine
untouched by time. (burps) Pardon me! A little

02:09:00.719 --> 02:09:05.018
effervescent tonight, apparently! The soot wipes
off of it cleanly.

02:09:05.018 --> 02:09:16.488
LAURA: I hold it aloft. I found a weapon. I'll
bring it back over to you guys.

02:09:16.488 --> 02:09:18.030
LIAM: I also talk to you.

02:09:18.030 --> 02:09:24.467
MATT: At this point, Aluneth does whisper and say
"You've already found a weapon. This is of no use

02:09:24.467 --> 02:09:25.419
"to you."

02:09:25.419 --> 02:09:27.589
LAURA: I'm not going to keep it. I'm going to give
it away.

02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:33.829
MATT: "Good. The sooner, the better." Goes silent.
You watch as, coasting over, blade forth, the magma

02:09:33.829 --> 02:09:38.380
rager still tensing against the edge as she flies
overhead.

02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:41.839
LAURA: I wave it towards the creature as I fly by,
but I don't get close enough to really do

02:09:41.839 --> 02:09:43.014
anything.

02:09:43.014 --> 02:09:45.958
MATT: Greldamine finally lands on the ground,
presenting the blade.

02:09:45.958 --> 02:09:47.643
LIAM: What kind of blade? How big is this thing?

02:09:47.643 --> 02:09:50.890
MATT: It's a longsword. It's big for a longsword,
but it does technically act as a longsword.

02:09:50.890 --> 02:09:56.368
LAURA: Which one of you would like this beautiful
blade?

02:09:56.368 --> 02:10:00.594
TRAVIS: I would like to see it.

02:10:00.594 --> 02:10:02.862
LIAM: I would also, but I would do roshambo with
you.

02:10:02.862 --> 02:10:03.750
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:05.992
LIAM: Okay. Best out of three, or just one time?

02:10:05.992 --> 02:10:07.162
TRAVIS: One time. Throw on four.

02:10:07.162 --> 02:10:10.556
LIAM: On four?! I have intelligence of eight.

02:10:10.556 --> 02:10:12.093
TRAVIS: Throw on three.

02:10:12.093 --> 02:10:13.217
LIAM: Throw on three?

02:10:13.217 --> 02:10:14.317
TRAVIS: Throw on one.

02:10:14.317 --> 02:10:22.362
LIAM: Why are you changing it on me? Let's do it
on two. We go one, two, shoot. Okay? All right.

02:10:22.362 --> 02:10:31.952
One, two, shoot! Oh shit, two papers. We go again.
One, two, shoot! Give me that shit.

02:10:31.952 --> 02:10:36.358
MATT: It's a very fine blade.

02:10:36.358 --> 02:10:39.096
JENNIFER: What's the name of her sword again?

02:10:39.096 --> 02:10:40.362
MATT: Aluneth.

02:10:40.362 --> 02:10:41.768
LAURA: It's a staff.

02:10:41.768 --> 02:10:44.617
JENNIFER: Sorry. Does Aluneth have anything to say
about where we are?

02:10:44.617 --> 02:10:51.343
LAURA: Oh mighty Aluneth, do you have anything to
say about where we are?

02:10:51.343 --> 02:10:53.271
LIAM: You seem very crazy right now.

02:10:53.271 --> 02:10:54.804
LAURA: It talks, I swear.

02:10:54.804 --> 02:11:03.958
MATT: The voice comes back in from the aether. "I
do despise these subterranean regions. I don't

02:11:03.958 --> 02:11:09.426
"recognize where we are. This world has changed
quite a bit since I last walked its surface."

02:11:09.426 --> 02:11:11.732
LAURA: Yes.

02:11:11.732 --> 02:11:14.582
JENNIFER: How long since you walked its surface?

02:11:14.582 --> 02:11:18.462
LAURA: How long since you walked its surface? I
mean, I know, I've heard about Aluneth before.

02:11:18.462 --> 02:11:19.938
It's very ancient.

02:11:19.938 --> 02:11:26.600
MATT: "Of course you have. I don't know,
generations."

02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:28.525
LAURA: Long time.

02:11:28.525 --> 02:11:31.187
TALIESIN: Could you fly over to the--

02:11:31.187 --> 02:11:34.318
MATT: Do you wish to attune to the weapon?

02:11:34.318 --> 02:11:38.021
LIAM: Hell yeah. I am attuned to nothing, so I
will attune to this.

02:11:38.021 --> 02:11:41.166
LAURA: You want me to go over to the collapse?

02:11:41.166 --> 02:11:45.071
TALIESIN: Yeah, lead the creature over to that
section.

02:11:45.071 --> 02:11:51.003
LAURA: Oh, okay! I'm going to fly over to the
collapsed area, because I've still got a little

02:11:51.003 --> 02:11:52.203
time left, right?

02:11:52.203 --> 02:11:54.111
MATT: Okay, so you coast over to the collapsed
area.

02:11:54.111 --> 02:11:57.734
LAURA: And I land. Now what do you want me to do?

02:11:57.734 --> 02:12:00.509
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and cast Hold Person on
the creature.

02:12:00.509 --> 02:12:03.952
LAURA: Wait, I'll wave my arms so he walks toward
me.

02:12:03.952 --> 02:12:05.988
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

02:12:05.988 --> 02:12:08.210
TALIESIN: God, it won't work on him, will it?

02:12:08.210 --> 02:12:11.763
MATT: Yeah, so the creature heads over and it's
focused on you. What'd you get?

02:12:11.763 --> 02:12:13.787
TALIESIN: I got 20.

02:12:13.787 --> 02:12:18.876
MATT: 20. You get the sense that Hold Person
mainly affects small humanoid creatures. A large

02:12:18.876 --> 02:12:20.813
elemental like this would not be held by a spell.

02:12:20.813 --> 02:12:22.581
LAURA: Is an elemental considered a monster?

02:12:22.581 --> 02:12:24.169
MATT: It's considered a monster.

02:12:24.169 --> 02:12:25.445
TRAVIS: Creature, though.

02:12:25.445 --> 02:12:29.088
MATT: So you discovered your weapon.

02:12:29.088 --> 02:12:35.998
LIAM: Yes. This was made for me. Should I be
describing this to the table? Yes, this is called

02:12:35.998 --> 02:12:42.284
Adventurefury, Blessed Blade of the Thrillseeker.
This weirdly pristine longsword is encased in

02:12:42.284 --> 02:12:47.172
meticulous, almost gaudy, gold scrolling and
rune-like carvings that spell out phrases like,

02:12:47.172 --> 02:12:53.831
"Carpe Diem", like your shirt with donut, and "You
only live once." You gain plus two to all attacks

02:12:53.831 --> 02:12:58.267
and damage rolls made with this weapon. You are
immune to fear and, if you ever attempt to flee

02:12:58.267 --> 02:13:04.859
from danger, you must make a wisdom saving throw,
DC 12. On a failure, you instead rush toward the

02:13:04.859 --> 02:13:07.435
challenge in hopes of glory. YOLO!

02:13:07.435 --> 02:13:10.067
TRAVIS: Yes! That's a great item!

02:13:10.067 --> 02:13:12.272
MATT: It's Adventurefury, Blessed Blade of the
Thrillseeker.

02:13:12.272 --> 02:13:14.871
TRAVIS: Oh my god! Damn!

02:13:14.871 --> 02:13:16.601
LAURA: Is that an actual blade in the game?

02:13:16.601 --> 02:13:17.781
MATT: (chuckling) No.

02:13:17.781 --> 02:13:20.309
LAURA: Please make it an actual weapon in the
game.

02:13:20.309 --> 02:13:23.079
MATT: It's an inside joke.

02:13:23.079 --> 02:13:27.238
LIAM: For Argus and for LRJenkins1234.

02:13:27.238 --> 02:13:35.404
TRAVIS: I could try to stun him if we all wanted
to make a break for one side or the other. I'm not

02:13:35.404 --> 02:13:39.257
sure if it would work, so, any other ideas?

02:13:39.257 --> 02:13:41.862
JENNIFER: Which side?

02:13:41.862 --> 02:13:47.093
LAURA: Straight through, I think! I mean, that's
what Reek said.

02:13:47.093 --> 02:13:48.593
TRAVIS: Wasn't Reek lying?

02:13:48.593 --> 02:13:51.085
LAURA: No! He's very trustworthy.

02:13:51.085 --> 02:13:55.247
JENNIFER: I think there's something on the other
side that we don't know. We need to know.

02:13:55.247 --> 02:13:57.438
TRAVIS: I cast Zone of Truth.

02:13:57.438 --> 02:14:04.687
MATT: Okay. What's your spell DC? Oh, 13, right?
Nope.

02:14:04.687 --> 02:14:05.996
LAURA: Yay!

02:14:05.996 --> 02:14:13.565
TRAVIS: Cheeker-- what's his name? Oh, right,
Reek.

02:14:13.565 --> 02:14:16.081
MATT: "Reeksus."

02:14:16.081 --> 02:14:21.007
TRAVIS: Do you really know the way back to
Tagwaggle?

02:14:21.007 --> 02:14:22.823
MATT: "I do, yes!"

02:14:22.823 --> 02:14:24.478
TRAVIS: Which direction is it?

02:14:24.478 --> 02:14:29.072
MATT: "That would be (straining) right!"

02:14:29.072 --> 02:14:34.660
LAURA: He lied to me!

02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:38.175
TRAVIS: He did. I'm sure it's nothing personal,
though!

02:14:38.175 --> 02:14:39.954
MATT: "I'm bad with directions!"

02:14:39.954 --> 02:14:49.900
LAURA: He's telling the truth! Do you like us?
Aww. Do you like me?

02:14:49.900 --> 02:14:52.495
TRAVIS: No, he has to answer.

02:14:52.495 --> 02:14:56.157
MATT: "I endure you!"

02:14:56.157 --> 02:14:58.637
LAURA: I'll take it!

02:14:58.637 --> 02:15:00.783
MATT: I endure you.

02:15:00.783 --> 02:15:03.596
LIAM: Hey, Shakira, do you fear me?

02:15:03.596 --> 02:15:05.624
MATT: (panicked wimper)

02:15:05.624 --> 02:15:08.082
LIAM: Good, that's all that matters. Let's go.

02:15:08.082 --> 02:15:09.489
LAURA: I think I'm running out of my ten minutes.

02:15:09.489 --> 02:15:11.277
MATT: You're getting down to the last couple of
minutes.

02:15:11.277 --> 02:15:14.137
LAURA: I need to stand up and I need to fly away
from this place, or else I'm going to be stranded

02:15:14.137 --> 02:15:15.316
on this side!

02:15:15.316 --> 02:15:16.919
TALIESIN: You can land wherever we need to be.

02:15:16.919 --> 02:15:19.867
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I'm going to do, but I want to
fly around to the other side.

02:15:19.867 --> 02:15:24.710
MATT: Okay, so you coast around to this platform
over here and land on the opposite side of the

02:15:24.710 --> 02:15:28.759
bridge. The magma rager spins and is flexing in
the direction of where you are.

02:15:28.759 --> 02:15:32.704
TRAVIS: While the Zone of Truth is still active,
Bundle, what are you the most afraid of?

02:15:32.704 --> 02:15:36.451
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

02:15:36.451 --> 02:15:48.324
TALIESIN: Oh! That's a 24.

02:15:48.324 --> 02:15:49.844
MATT: Answer as you feel.

02:15:49.844 --> 02:15:58.076
TALIESIN: Not you. Not even a little. You're so
soft and squishy.

02:15:58.076 --> 02:16:01.530
TRAVIS: No, see, if it was a spider, then I could
take care of it for you. I don't want to leave you

02:16:01.530 --> 02:16:03.133
in an awkward situation.

02:16:03.133 --> 02:16:04.646
JENNIFER: Should we leave you two alone?

02:16:04.646 --> 02:16:05.839
TALIESIN: No.

02:16:05.839 --> 02:16:07.534
MATT: "Yes!"

02:16:07.534 --> 02:16:11.848
TALIESIN: Well, you only live once.

02:16:11.848 --> 02:16:14.118
LAURA: What are you going to do?

02:16:14.118 --> 02:16:16.216
TRAVIS: Do it.

02:16:16.216 --> 02:16:18.323
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a run for it. Fuck
it.

02:16:18.323 --> 02:16:19.704
MATT: What's your strength?

02:16:19.704 --> 02:16:24.024
TALIESIN: My strength is 16.

02:16:24.024 --> 02:16:31.665
MATT: 16? That's easy enough for you. You run and
leap, big dwarven strong legs. You leap across. You

02:16:31.665 --> 02:16:38.969
land on the center platform, at which point the
magma rager turns to face you. What are you

02:16:38.969 --> 02:16:40.606
doing?

02:16:40.606 --> 02:16:44.919
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Sacred Flame, which I
know will do very little on him, but it might

02:16:44.919 --> 02:16:50.049
temporarily irritate him. I'm going to run the
opposite direction.

02:16:50.049 --> 02:16:54.992
MATT: Okay, Sacred Flame. So he makes a dexterity
saving throw. No, it's an action to do that.

02:16:54.992 --> 02:16:58.137
TALIESIN: Oh, it's an action to do that? Should I
burn my action running?

02:16:58.137 --> 02:17:04.216
MATT: To dash? You can, if you want to. Okay, you
go running as it goes charging toward you. It's

02:17:04.216 --> 02:17:14.751
going to go ahead and attempt to make a
charge-slam attack. That is going to be a 23 to

02:17:14.751 --> 02:17:16.433
hit.

02:17:16.433 --> 02:17:18.266
TALIESIN: Oh my god, yeah, that hits.

02:17:18.266 --> 02:17:21.090
MATT: Double ones on the attack, so only six
points of bludgeoning damage.

02:17:21.090 --> 02:17:22.391
TALIESIN: I can live with that.

02:17:22.391 --> 02:17:23.822
MATT: Six points of fire damage.

02:17:23.822 --> 02:17:25.240
TALIESIN: I can live with that too.

02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:30.734
MATT: As it slams into you, you immediately get
pushed 15 feet back into the air. You arc

02:17:30.734 --> 02:17:36.532
backwards. As you're falling back, you can look,
you're edging toward where the central platform

02:17:36.532 --> 02:17:40.356
where you were before you go to the middle one,
and off to the side where the lava is. Go ahead

02:17:40.356 --> 02:17:41.985
and make an acrobatics check.

02:17:41.985 --> 02:17:48.143
TALIESIN: God, if I have to do an action, I hope I
can get an action before this happens. Acrobatics

02:17:48.143 --> 02:17:49.438
check, oh god.

02:17:49.438 --> 02:17:51.181
TRAVIS: Why'd you give the Snitch back?!

02:17:51.181 --> 02:17:52.876
TALIESIN: Because I'm an idiot! 20.

02:17:52.876 --> 02:17:58.757
MATT: 20? You barely manage to catch yourself on
the edge and roll back up (straining) onto the

02:17:58.757 --> 02:18:05.076
platform. The magma rager is right there staring
at you, its burning coal magma eyes angrily

02:18:05.076 --> 02:18:06.865
staring at your dwarven form.

02:18:06.865 --> 02:18:08.653
TALIESIN: So where am I now?

02:18:08.653 --> 02:18:11.729
MATT: You are now currently right here in the
center, yeah.

02:18:11.729 --> 02:18:13.649
LAURA: Oh, he ran backwards?

02:18:13.649 --> 02:18:16.982
MATT: He slammed into him as he ran toward him and
pushed him back onto the middle platform. At least

02:18:16.982 --> 02:18:18.684
he didn't fall in.

02:18:18.684 --> 02:18:25.209
LAURA: Okay, I have an idea. Is he considered
fighting us right now, or is he just staring?

02:18:25.209 --> 02:18:30.800
MATT: I mean, in theory, it can't seemingly do
anything at you from range, so he's waiting for

02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:35.502
somebody to come to his platform. If you decide to
then assault him on the middle platform, there'd

02:18:35.502 --> 02:18:38.327
be an initiative roll. But right now it doesn't
seem to have any means of attacking at range.

02:18:38.327 --> 02:18:42.997
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to cast Charm Monster
on the creature.

02:18:42.997 --> 02:18:45.223
MATT: Okay. So this is your 4th-level?

02:18:45.223 --> 02:18:46.501
LAURA: It is.

02:18:46.501 --> 02:18:48.572
MATT: It rolled a four, so it does not succeed.

02:18:48.572 --> 02:18:54.862
LAURA: Woo! You love us! We're really great! Let
us pass!

02:18:54.862 --> 02:19:03.274
MATT: You watch as its intense expression toward
the dwarf slackens and it flexes its shoulders and

02:19:03.274 --> 02:19:08.214
then roils back to the center platform and then
looks over toward you with a nod.

02:19:08.214 --> 02:19:15.729
LAURA: Your mama loves you very much. Your papa's
very proud of you. Come on, you guys.

02:19:15.729 --> 02:19:17.998
TRAVIS: Doesn't seem so scary! Across.

02:19:17.998 --> 02:19:20.947
MATT: All right, so your strength, your strength.
What's your strength?

02:19:20.947 --> 02:19:24.069
JENNIFER: Ah, zero. Or ten, sorry, ten.

02:19:24.069 --> 02:19:26.691
LAURA: Nobody attack him, guys. If anybody touches
him, this is going to break.

02:19:26.691 --> 02:19:31.157
MATT: Yeah, so the three of you make it across
fine without any issue. Go ahead and make an

02:19:31.157 --> 02:19:32.996
acrobatics check for me.

02:19:32.996 --> 02:19:35.108
LIAM: 20. Natural 20.

02:19:35.108 --> 02:19:39.941
MATT: I'll let that go for all of them. With a
natural 20, seeing this happen and watching them

02:19:39.941 --> 02:19:45.754
all dart across, you begin to do hand-over-feet,
full-on handspring-style leaping over the

02:19:45.754 --> 02:19:50.624
platforms past the rager. You all make it over to
the side platform, meeting up with your mage

02:19:50.624 --> 02:19:54.055
friend as the magma rager's still sitting there,
resting in the center, looking toward you for some

02:19:54.055 --> 02:19:55.625
sort of an order.

02:19:55.625 --> 02:19:56.744
TRAVIS: I did have Reeksus with me.

02:19:56.744 --> 02:20:05.231
MATT: (screeching) (impact) He's being dragged and
slammed like some horrible, slow-motion yo-yo.

02:20:05.231 --> 02:20:08.608
TALIESIN: I did a quick Cure Wounds back to 41.

02:20:08.608 --> 02:20:10.974
LAURA: Can you talk, magma monster?

02:20:10.974 --> 02:20:19.395
MATT: You hear it emitting some sort of sound, but
it sounds like a heavy bonfire and rocks banging

02:20:19.395 --> 02:20:20.835
together.

02:20:20.835 --> 02:20:28.078
LAURA: You know what friends do? They dance.
Friends dance with each other. We should dance.

02:20:28.078 --> 02:20:33.176
MATT: So as you step up to the edge of the
platform, begin to gnome-dance, the rager--

02:20:33.176 --> 02:20:37.180
LIAM: Is it the Warcraft dancing animation?

02:20:37.180 --> 02:20:38.863
LAURA: Yeah.

02:20:38.863 --> 02:20:48.483
MATT: There's this large elemental covered in
armor that's pseudo-getting down with this tiny

02:20:48.483 --> 02:20:53.214
mage gnome on the edge of the platform as the lava
glows from underneath, uplighting him.

02:20:53.214 --> 02:20:57.905
LAURA: I guess we can go, you guys. See you
later.

02:20:57.905 --> 02:21:02.267
MATT: As you walk away, it slowly stops dancing
and goes back to rest in the center of the

02:21:02.267 --> 02:21:07.306
platform. All righty, that was a unique solution.

02:21:07.306 --> 02:21:12.590
TRAVIS: Reeksus, now that your lies are through,
lead the way. Quietly!

02:21:12.590 --> 02:21:14.546
LIAM: We are problem solvers!

02:21:14.546 --> 02:21:19.553
MATT: "Quietly is the key here! Shh!"

02:21:19.553 --> 02:21:24.221
LIAM: Aw, I don't feel bad. Why is that?

02:21:24.221 --> 02:21:29.815
MATT: "Big thing lives ahead!"

02:21:29.815 --> 02:21:33.235
LIAM: Not Toddlewaddle? Something else?

02:21:33.235 --> 02:21:37.533
MATT: "Togwaggle beyond. This is big dragon!"

02:21:37.533 --> 02:21:41.684
LIAM: What did you say?

02:21:41.853 --> 02:21:42.973
MATT: "Dragon!"

02:21:42.973 --> 02:21:53.664
TRAVIS: I have actually not gone up against a
dragon. I just want to put that out there.

02:21:53.664 --> 02:21:56.250
TALIESIN: They're not bad. Well, I mean, I hear
they're not bad.

02:21:56.250 --> 02:21:57.994
LAURA: Have you ever seen a dragon in person?

02:21:57.994 --> 02:22:01.021
TALIESIN: No, no. I mean, well, no. Well, no.

02:22:01.021 --> 02:22:03.365
TRAVIS: Reeksus, one dragon? Just one?

02:22:03.365 --> 02:22:05.842
MATT: "One dragon. Not too bad for you, right?"

02:22:05.842 --> 02:22:09.310
LAURA: Have you ever seen a dragon?

02:22:09.310 --> 02:22:13.864
JENNIFER: Yes. Well, my grandfather, he told me
tales of them, yes.

02:22:13.864 --> 02:22:16.396
LAURA: Okay.

02:22:16.396 --> 02:22:19.953
JENNIFER: We choose the shadows in the presence of
dragons.

02:22:19.953 --> 02:22:22.706
TRAVIS: Yes, let's stealth for a minute.

02:22:22.706 --> 02:22:32.335
MATT: As you guys press down through the darkened
grade, the heat subsides slightly. You feel the

02:22:32.335 --> 02:22:41.399
breeze now, this pulsing breeze through the
tunnel, rhythmic almost, as you turn into an open

02:22:41.399 --> 02:22:48.953
cavern, a magnificent natural pocket of geodes and
crystals, beautiful blue and green crystals

02:22:48.953 --> 02:22:55.239
refracting patches of luminous fungus into these
faint kaleidoscopes that permeate the entirety of

02:22:55.239 --> 02:23:02.582
this entryway. There's a visible exit across the
chamber and slightly to the left, where you can

02:23:02.582 --> 02:23:13.906
see in the middle is a glittering mass, piles upon
piles of gold coins, punctuated by gems of all

02:23:13.906 --> 02:23:19.307
colors peeking through this hoard. As you enter
and look about, it is more money than any of you

02:23:19.307 --> 02:23:29.342
have ever seen. There atop this mound, you see
lying the gargantuan, curled form of a sleeping

02:23:29.342 --> 02:23:35.056
red dragon, arms crossed, head resting there,
(snoring).

02:23:35.056 --> 02:23:40.652
JENNIFER: Creature hasn't acted in combat yet?

02:23:40.652 --> 02:23:52.317
LIAM: Yeah, but I have to share. Speaking in
accent, but out of game. As a former rogue,

02:23:52.317 --> 02:24:01.050
boo-hoo, this one is asking me if assassinate is
good in this moment to get a special surprise

02:24:01.050 --> 02:24:04.800
attack on gargantuan-sized dragon. Yes.

02:24:04.800 --> 02:24:06.237
JENNIFER: He doesn't know I'm here.

02:24:06.237 --> 02:24:07.441
MATT: It's true.

02:24:07.441 --> 02:24:10.029
TRAVIS: Is she asking Quazi, or is she asking
Vax?

02:24:10.029 --> 02:24:16.452
LIAM: You would almost definitely hit dragon, but
it would be like taking donut and hitting side of

02:24:16.452 --> 02:24:25.768
Empire State Building. Absolutely you will hit,
absolutely. You will take off half of one scale of

02:24:25.768 --> 02:24:32.676
dragon. I mean, you can do it. This is Dungeons &amp;
Dragons. Do whatever you like, but I'm just

02:24:32.676 --> 02:24:35.504
saying, the game will end in two minutes.

02:24:35.504 --> 02:24:37.546
MATT: Technically, it's Kobolds &amp; Catacombs.

02:24:37.546 --> 02:24:43.082
JENNIFER: Point made.

02:24:43.082 --> 02:24:45.612
LIAM: I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; curious to see.

02:24:45.612 --> 02:24:52.037
TRAVIS: It's still sleeping. What else do we see
in this--?

02:24:52.037 --> 02:24:54.290
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:24:54.290 --> 02:24:57.008
TRAVIS: Okay. With advantage still? Blue fungus
still?

02:24:57.008 --> 02:24:58.420
MATT: You do, yeah.

02:24:58.420 --> 02:24:59.991
TALIESIN: You're a fun guy.

02:24:59.991 --> 02:25:01.544
TRAVIS: Thank you, Taliesin. 19.

02:25:01.544 --> 02:25:06.379
MATT: 19. Glancing about, you can see that the
crystals across the room appear to have been

02:25:06.379 --> 02:25:12.183
either naturally grown, or some have been placed
with some sort of faint, magical light behind them

02:25:12.183 --> 02:25:16.914
that, when it refracts, it actually acts as a
light source within the chamber, almost

02:25:16.914 --> 02:25:23.463
intentionally so to make the place prettier.
Looking throughout this large cluster of coins on

02:25:23.463 --> 02:25:30.354
the floor, you can see broken bits of furniture
and decor, things that have been jammed into there

02:25:30.354 --> 02:25:37.800
and bent slightly, like vases and sculptures.
Various pieces of art that are scattered in this

02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:45.210
horde. What does catch your eye is there is a
beautiful, jagged-looking dagger with a series of

02:25:45.210 --> 02:25:52.868
red gems across the blade, a chain affixed to its
pommel that is currently resting partially jammed

02:25:52.868 --> 02:25:55.814
underneath one of the hands of the sleeping
dragon.

02:25:55.814 --> 02:25:59.095
LIAM: Tempting, tempting.

02:25:59.095 --> 02:26:03.034
TRAVIS: I bet he's a heavy sleeper.

02:26:03.034 --> 02:26:08.105
LIAM: Yes. If anyone's going to fuck with that
shit, it's going to be you, but it's still a big

02:26:08.105 --> 02:26:09.409
if.

02:26:09.409 --> 02:26:10.534
JENNIFER: I'm in.

02:26:10.534 --> 02:26:11.659
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:26:11.659 --> 02:26:19.754
LIAM: I also have a question about this item that
I'm attuned to. Let's say that this one's not

02:26:19.754 --> 02:26:26.823
crazy enough to grab dagger and we just want to go
by. This says that, if you ever attempt to flee

02:26:26.823 --> 02:26:29.755
from danger, you make wisdom save. Does sneaking
by--?

02:26:29.755 --> 02:26:31.601
MATT: Avoiding is different than fleeing.

02:26:31.601 --> 02:26:36.528
LIAM: I just wanted to triple check. Part of me
thinks it would be hilarious to see me rush in,

02:26:36.528 --> 02:26:37.823
but--

02:26:37.823 --> 02:26:41.646
MATT: Oh, believe me, part of me thinks it'd be
hilarious, too. But distinctive; fleeing is

02:26:41.646 --> 02:26:47.137
different. If the dragon were to be awakened and
engage you, it might be a different deal, but

02:26:47.137 --> 02:26:49.286
slaying a sleeping creature is no glory.

02:26:49.286 --> 02:26:50.992
LIAM and MATT: YOLO.

02:26:50.992 --> 02:26:54.110
TRAVIS: Are there any other exits out of this
room?

02:26:54.110 --> 02:26:58.015
MATT: Currently, from what you view, no. The rest
of the chamber appears to be the home to where

02:26:58.015 --> 02:27:01.807
this dragon is. You do not see an exit and it
seems strange that a dragon of this size would

02:27:01.807 --> 02:27:03.260
find its way in or out.

02:27:03.260 --> 02:27:08.734
TRAVIS: Not to be a stickler for our contract, but
do we see any candles?

02:27:08.734 --> 02:27:14.484
MATT: Looking around with your perception bit, you
glance around, and you can see there is a trail of

02:27:14.484 --> 02:27:20.831
flecks of wax that lead across the left side of
the chamber into the exit where it goes. So it

02:27:20.831 --> 02:27:24.054
looks like whatever has been transporting the mass
of candles went that direction.

02:27:24.054 --> 02:27:25.854
LAURA: Great, there's the exit.

02:27:25.854 --> 02:27:29.515
TALIESIN: I'm going to start making my way that
direction no matter what.

02:27:29.515 --> 02:27:32.482
LAURA: Sneaking, sneaking. As stealthy as
possible.

02:27:32.482 --> 02:27:34.043
MATT: Who's sneaking first?

02:27:34.043 --> 02:27:35.621
TALIESIN: Sure.

02:27:35.621 --> 02:27:36.957
MATT: Make a stealth check, please.

02:27:36.957 --> 02:27:43.274
TALIESIN: That's all right. 19.

02:27:43.274 --> 02:27:51.126
MATT: As you make your way slowly around the edge
of the chamber, carefully stepping gingerly on

02:27:51.126 --> 02:28:01.735
your dwarven toes, with a sudden snort, it shifts
slightly. As it blows hot air from its nostrils, a

02:28:01.735 --> 02:28:11.947
few coins glitter and come to rest. Stillness.
Your breath is held. Slowly you exhale as it does

02:28:11.947 --> 02:28:15.852
not appear to have disturbed the dragon. You
slowly make your way the rest of the way across

02:28:15.852 --> 02:28:20.252
the chamber and you're now standing at the archway
for the tunnel that extends beyond to the next area.

02:28:20.252 --> 02:28:21.798
Who's next?

02:28:21.798 --> 02:28:28.133
LIAM: I elbow the gnome and lip sync, and I say,
&lt;i&gt;chain&lt;/i&gt;.

02:28:28.133 --> 02:28:29.459
LAURA: No, no.

02:28:29.459 --> 02:28:30.542
LIAM: I know.

02:28:30.542 --> 02:28:38.053
LAURA: Don't do it! Okay. Are you going? Okay, I'm
going to try to go.

02:28:38.053 --> 02:28:41.458
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

02:28:41.458 --> 02:28:44.545
LIAM: You all need to go through because, you
know, I'm so big and heavy.

02:28:44.545 --> 02:28:47.424
LAURA: Once you're through, and then she's got to
go last because she's going to try and steal that

02:28:47.424 --> 02:28:48.813
dagger.

02:28:48.813 --> 02:28:52.070
MATT: What'd you roll?

02:28:52.070 --> 02:28:53.465
LAURA: 13.

02:28:53.465 --> 02:29:03.400
MATT: 13, okay. As you slowly make your way
through, there's a slight shift to the dragon's

02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:12.328
neck position as it turns (snorting). One eye
slightly opens and you watch as the interior

02:29:12.328 --> 02:29:23.467
secondary lid flicks a little bit and a voice,
(grunting). And it instinctually lobs out a jet of

02:29:23.467 --> 02:29:28.656
flame in your direction. I need you to make a
dexterity saving throw, please.

02:29:28.656 --> 02:29:38.365
LAURA: Ten!

02:29:38.365 --> 02:29:40.846
TRAVIS: That's a lot of dice.

02:29:40.846 --> 02:29:44.537
MATT: You take 38 points of fire damage.

02:29:44.537 --> 02:29:58.552
LAURA: Well, I'm unconscious! Oh wait, no. Okay,
wait, let me do my math because I have my Mage

02:29:58.552 --> 02:30:04.830
Armor up, which means that my Arcane Ward is
active, which means I have 19 hit points on my

02:30:04.830 --> 02:30:06.141
ward.

02:30:06.141 --> 02:30:07.517
MATT: Which it takes those off first. Yes.

02:30:07.517 --> 02:30:14.930
LAURA: Yes, so that means there's, how many? 38
minus 19. So 19 left. So I'm still alive!

02:30:14.930 --> 02:30:21.892
MATT: So the dragon, after snorting haphazardly in
a brief moment of being roused from its slumber,

02:30:21.892 --> 02:30:27.293
its dream, it goes back to sleep as the jet of
flame subsides. You look over and see this, what

02:30:27.293 --> 02:30:35.091
once was a tightly- and well-placed-together bun,
is now a singed mat of scraggled gnome hair as the

02:30:35.091 --> 02:30:40.066
mage stands there, covered in soot, little bits of
fire burning off the edge of the cloak-robe.

02:30:40.066 --> 02:30:45.987
TALIESIN: I'm going to throw a Cure Wounds at that
to help with that.

02:30:45.987 --> 02:30:48.314
LAURA: I'm going to stealthily run toward him.

02:30:48.314 --> 02:30:51.802
MATT: You catch up with Bundle as he goes ahead
and heals. Go ahead and roll for that.

02:30:51.802 --> 02:30:55.472
TALIESIN: You get 11 points back to help.

02:30:55.472 --> 02:30:58.277
MATT: All right, who's next?

02:30:58.277 --> 02:31:01.691
TRAVIS: I'll go.

02:31:01.691 --> 02:31:05.916
MATT: Make a stealth check.

02:31:05.916 --> 02:31:08.359
TRAVIS: That's a five.

02:31:08.359 --> 02:31:15.885
MATT: All right. As you follow suit behind your
gnomish friend, &lt;i&gt;clank clank&lt;/i&gt;, a couple of

02:31:15.885 --> 02:31:25.578
footfalls hit and you hear how loud it is. You
stop. (snorting) Heck yeah, it's totally sleeping.

02:31:25.578 --> 02:31:35.001
Two more steps. &lt;i&gt;Clang, clang, clang!&lt;/i&gt; (snorting)
You hold still. Okay, it's fine. Two more steps.

02:31:35.001 --> 02:31:39.971
Clang, shink! Your foot hits a small pot on the
ground, which breaks and shatters at the impact of

02:31:39.971 --> 02:31:44.964
your armored foot. (grunting and whooshing) Make a
dexterity saving throw.

02:31:44.964 --> 02:31:50.439
TRAVIS: Nope! Five again!

02:31:50.439 --> 02:31:53.749
MATT: Okay.

02:31:53.749 --> 02:31:57.158
TRAVIS: Let the dice hit the floor.

02:31:57.158 --> 02:31:59.977
MATT: 35 points of fire damage.

02:31:59.977 --> 02:32:02.894
LARUA: Oh jeez! Are you alive?

02:32:02.894 --> 02:32:10.237
MATT: As this gout of fire slams into and burns
all of your flesh, it takes all personal strength

02:32:10.237 --> 02:32:13.963
to not scream out in pain as the flames subside.
You're like, (gasping).

02:32:13.963 --> 02:32:16.778
TRAVIS: Yeah, can I--

02:32:16.778 --> 02:32:19.505
MATT: Are you still holding the rope that
connects?

02:32:19.505 --> 02:32:23.564
TRAVIS: Oh, I was, wasn't I? I still had Reek.

02:32:23.564 --> 02:32:28.177
MATT: Yeah, the rope is burned off now. Reeks,
while still bound, doesn't have a tether.

02:32:28.177 --> 02:32:30.277
TRAVIS: Did he get smoked by the fire too?

02:32:30.277 --> 02:32:36.047
MATt: No, because he was a number of feet behind
you. He's like, (gasping). But you can make the

02:32:36.047 --> 02:32:37.499
rest of the way if you would like to.

02:32:37.499 --> 02:32:41.383
TRAVIS: Yeah, I would like to. And can I Lay on
Hands, dump the rest of my hit point pool into--?

02:32:41.383 --> 02:32:42.613
Okay.

02:32:42.613 --> 02:32:45.913
MATT: And so the three of you are across now. It's
just the two of you and Reeksus.

02:32:45.913 --> 02:32:50.523
LIAM: Okay. So you want to try to tangle with the
devil and try to take this blade?

02:32:50.523 --> 02:32:52.219
JENNIFER: I do, I do.

02:32:52.219 --> 02:33:00.704
LIAM: Hm. And what is the landscape like from
where they are to where we are, here?

02:33:00.704 --> 02:33:07.524
MATT: It looks like most of it is either a small,
maybe eight- to ten-foot-wide walkway with bits of

02:33:07.524 --> 02:33:12.350
furniture and gold that are pressed over there,
and a few small pillars that have nothing resting

02:33:12.350 --> 02:33:16.807
on them at the moment, and along the curved wall
where everyone has been stealthing around. The

02:33:16.807 --> 02:33:20.186
rest of the chamber is filled by hoard pile and
the dragon.

02:33:20.186 --> 02:33:27.839
LIAM: Here's what I think. If I fucking move, big
noise, jig is blown. You need me to stay still. So

02:33:27.839 --> 02:33:35.430
you do your thing and if it goes well, you go and
then I go. If things go bad, we all die together.

02:33:35.430 --> 02:33:40.018
JENNIFER: Things go bad, can you run while I
distract him with my things going bad?

02:33:40.018 --> 02:33:43.254
LIAM: You know, no promises. We'll see what
happens. Good luck.

02:33:43.254 --> 02:33:49.249
JENNIFER: Here goes nothing.

02:33:49.249 --> 02:33:51.744
MATT: Stealth check.

02:33:51.882 --> 02:34:03.024
LIAM: Stealth, oh. It's a one. Does she have--?
She does not. Does she have what I had?

02:34:03.024 --> 02:34:06.031
MATT: Are you talking about Reliable Talent?
That's a much higher level skill, unfortunately.

02:34:06.031 --> 02:34:07.910
LIAM: Oh, too bad, so sad.

02:34:07.910 --> 02:34:21.261
MATT: So as you approach and grab the base of the
dagger, you slowly climb up the coins and get your

02:34:21.261 --> 02:34:32.159
hand around the hilt. As you tug, it's caught on
something. You're like, no, I don't know if this

02:34:32.159 --> 02:34:40.058
is worth it. You pull again. It's caught on
something. Eventually, it comes free. Whew. You

02:34:40.058 --> 02:34:47.039
glance up and watch as this large, yellow eye is
looking right down at you as a deep voice begins

02:34:47.039 --> 02:34:56.906
to vibrate the ground. The coins jangle at the
sheer bass of its intensity. "Might I ask what

02:34:56.906 --> 02:34:58.632
"you're doing?"

02:34:58.632 --> 02:35:03.207
JENNIFER: I thought it was stuck in your hand. I
thought I would help.

02:35:03.207 --> 02:35:12.211
MATT: "Well, allow me to help you." The arms
suddenly reach out and grab as it lifts its torso

02:35:12.211 --> 02:35:15.145
back. Its head retracts as it inhales.

02:35:15.145 --> 02:35:17.786
TALIESIN: Power Word Shield.

02:35:17.786 --> 02:35:22.314
MATT: Okay, so you're using Power Word Shield on
her? Go ahead and roll up for that. You guys are

02:35:22.314 --> 02:35:24.253
over there. What are you doing?

02:35:24.253 --> 02:35:31.091
LIAM: LRJenkins1234!

02:35:31.091 --> 02:35:36.278
MATT: What are you guys doing? This large dragon
is now rearing back. What are you doing?

02:35:36.278 --> 02:35:37.830
LIAM: Running forward.

02:35:37.830 --> 02:35:39.901
MATT: I need everyone to roll initiative.

02:35:39.901 --> 02:35:43.498
JENNIFER: 16 temporary hit points? What does that
mean?

02:35:43.498 --> 02:35:47.188
TALIESIN: It means add 16 that you're about to
probably lose.

02:35:47.188 --> 02:35:48.628
LIAM: So you're there.

02:35:48.628 --> 02:35:49.919
JENNIFER: 56, 62, 72.

02:35:49.919 --> 02:35:52.433
LIAM: But this is where you're at isn't it? Or is
that where you're at?

02:35:52.433 --> 02:35:53.819
JENNIFER: No, I'm right here, that's where I'm at.

02:35:53.819 --> 02:35:57.004
LIAM: You shouldn't be there because you can't go
higher than that so now you add 16 &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; that and

02:35:57.004 --> 02:35:59.504
that's where you are. So 45 add 16.

02:35:59.504 --> 02:36:00.661
JENNIFER: 61.

02:36:00.661 --> 02:36:01.703
LIAM: Yeah.

02:36:01.703 --> 02:36:04.475
MATT: All right so, initiative everyone. 25 to 20?

02:36:04.475 --> 02:36:05.629
LAURA: 20.

02:36:05.629 --> 02:36:08.832
LIAM: 24. Oh shit, that was Vax's voice.

02:36:08.832 --> 02:36:11.066
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was!

02:36:11.066 --> 02:36:12.993
TALIESIN: Seven.

02:36:12.993 --> 02:36:14.709
TRAVIS: 19.

02:36:14.709 --> 02:36:17.572
JENNIFER: Do I roll for that?

02:36:17.572 --> 02:36:19.659
MATT: Yeah, you do. Roll initiative.

02:36:19.659 --> 02:36:24.423
JENNIFER: Oh god, four. You're done.

02:36:24.423 --> 02:36:26.666
MATT: Four plus--? What's your initiative modifier
there?

02:36:26.666 --> 02:36:27.962
JENNIFER: Initiative, my initiative is--

02:36:27.962 --> 02:36:29.391
LIAM: Five plus whatever you roll.

02:36:29.391 --> 02:36:33.858
JENNIFER: Nine. It's not going very well is it?

02:36:33.858 --> 02:36:35.797
LAURA: This is going to go very badly.

02:36:35.797 --> 02:36:39.130
MATT: What did you get Bundle?

02:36:39.130 --> 02:36:40.450
TALIESIN: Seven.

02:36:40.450 --> 02:36:42.177
MATT: Ooh.

02:36:42.177 --> 02:36:46.979
JENNIFER: YOLO?

02:36:46.979 --> 02:36:50.961
LAURA: We have candles to get!

02:36:50.961 --> 02:36:57.963
MATT: So, top of the round is you. Quazirat. Are
you running to meet up with the rest of the party?

02:36:57.963 --> 02:37:05.837
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Party?&lt;/i&gt; I'm running at dragon. Yes. I'm not
running from dragon. Couldn't if I tried now.

02:37:05.837 --> 02:37:08.597
Well, maybe I could.

02:37:08.597 --> 02:37:12.948
MATT: It's a small tunnel that everyone else is
standing at.

02:37:12.948 --> 02:37:16.938
LIAM: Nah, I'm going to dragon. Yeah. First one is
17.

02:37:16.938 --> 02:37:18.271
MATT: Nope!

02:37:18.271 --> 02:37:22.125
LIAM: Of course not. Second one is 25.

02:37:22.125 --> 02:37:23.950
MATT: 25 hits.

02:37:23.950 --> 02:37:31.794
LIAM: Yes, it does. Okay so that is big damage,
16!

02:37:31.794 --> 02:37:37.503
MATT: 16 points of damage as you strike, arching
your Adventurefury Blessed Blade of the Thrill

02:37:37.503 --> 02:37:42.589
Seeker across the chest of the red dragon. It
scrapes through and you see a little trickle of

02:37:42.589 --> 02:37:47.742
blood begin to spill from the little bit of scales
that you carved through. It's still inhaling and

02:37:47.742 --> 02:37:49.653
seems to not even notice your presence.

02:37:49.653 --> 02:37:53.036
LIAM: Oh buddy. Let's go!

02:37:53.036 --> 02:37:56.161
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Greldamine.

02:37:56.161 --> 02:38:00.193
LAURA: I'm going to hide and not fight a dragon.

02:38:00.193 --> 02:38:03.782
MATT: Okay, so you're retreating into the hallway
and hiding?

02:38:03.782 --> 02:38:04.751
LAURA: Yeah!

02:38:04.751 --> 02:38:08.349
MATT: You run deeper into the hallway. Are you
trying to make a hide action?

02:38:08.349 --> 02:38:09.576
LAURA: Sure.

02:38:09.576 --> 02:38:14.661
MATT: Make a stealth check. So you disappear into
the (screaming), into the cavern.

02:38:14.661 --> 02:38:17.346
LAURA: Oh, I didn't stealth very well. Seven.

02:38:17.346 --> 02:38:21.334
MATT: Okay, you feel like you're pretty stealthed.
All right, Lohkor.

02:38:21.334 --> 02:38:27.854
TRAVIS: I run forward with my warhammer and I'm
going to take two attacks and I'm going to dump

02:38:27.854 --> 02:38:30.311
Divine Smite into both of them.

02:38:30.311 --> 02:38:31.408
MATT: Go for it.

02:38:31.408 --> 02:38:35.488
TRAVIS: Smite. 22 for the first one.

02:38:35.488 --> 02:38:36.964
MATT: That hits.

02:38:36.964 --> 02:38:40.264
TRAVIS: And 16 for the second one.

02:38:40.264 --> 02:38:44.150
MATT: Does not hit. So you don't dump the second
one, once you hit you Divine Smite. So you didn't

02:38:44.150 --> 02:38:46.097
lose any spells.

02:38:46.097 --> 02:39:02.412
TRAVIS: Okay. 13 plus-- what's Divine Smite? There
it is. 2d8. 25 points of radiant damage.

02:39:02.412 --> 02:39:09.659
MATT: Nice. So as you run forward &lt;i&gt;slam&lt;/i&gt;! Your
hammer hits right near the wound that was left by

02:39:09.659 --> 02:39:14.012
your Draenei friend. As it impacts, there's a
flash of radiant energy and you watch as the wound

02:39:14.012 --> 02:39:20.723
opens up ever so slightly more. The dragon's still
(inhales). Your second strike, you go to swing at

02:39:20.723 --> 02:39:27.824
it and it hits the scales and the impact causes
your entire body to shake from the sheer force of

02:39:27.824 --> 02:39:31.383
its armor against your impact. No effect. That
ends your turn?

02:39:31.383 --> 02:39:32.762
TRAVIS: Yes, it does.

02:39:32.762 --> 02:39:43.635
MATT: All right. The dragon rears back and
releases an entire burst of fire breath towards

02:39:43.635 --> 02:39:48.542
all of you except for you. You're just out of
range because you ran. Everyone else, make a

02:39:48.542 --> 02:39:50.510
dexterity saving throw, please.

02:39:50.510 --> 02:39:55.377
TRAVIS: You have plus two because you're near me.

02:39:55.377 --> 02:39:56.933
LIAM: What did you get, what is that?

02:39:56.933 --> 02:39:58.488
JENNIFER: One.

02:39:58.488 --> 02:40:01.368
LIAM: That's seven plus your dex but it's still
not great.

02:40:01.368 --> 02:40:03.353
TRAVIS: Ten.

02:40:03.353 --> 02:40:06.274
LAURA: Everybody rolled shit.

02:40:06.274 --> 02:40:07.506
LIAM: Not me.

02:40:07.506 --> 02:40:09.099
TRAVIS: You get a plus two, Liam.

02:40:09.099 --> 02:40:13.047
LIAM: That's not bad.

02:40:13.047 --> 02:40:15.326
TRAVIS: What did you roll?

02:40:15.326 --> 02:40:17.192
LIAM: 22 total.

02:40:17.192 --> 02:40:22.683
MATT: Okay. You take 24 points of fire damage.

02:40:22.683 --> 02:40:24.832
LIAM: Ain't no thing but the chicken wing.

02:40:24.832 --> 02:40:30.478
MATT: You failed on the save, but you still take
half because of your evasion so you also take 24

02:40:30.478 --> 02:40:32.407
points of fire damage.

02:40:32.407 --> 02:40:33.370
JENNIFER: Okay.

02:40:33.370 --> 02:40:37.932
TALIESIN: Thank you for that cold resistance by
the way, that's really cool of you to put on this

02:40:37.932 --> 02:40:38.885
character.

02:40:38.885 --> 02:40:40.178
MATT: Dude, dwarves have frost resistance in
Warcraft, I'm sorry.

02:40:40.178 --> 02:40:41.721
TALIESIN: I know, bring it.

02:40:41.721 --> 02:40:42.931
MATT: What did you roll on your--

02:40:42.931 --> 02:40:43.723
TALIESIN: Ten.

02:40:43.723 --> 02:40:45.070
TRAVIS: Ten here as well.

02:40:45.070 --> 02:40:46.707
MATT: Okay. So you take 48 points of fire damage.

02:40:46.707 --> 02:40:47.714
TALIESIN: I'm out.

02:40:47.714 --> 02:40:48.812
TRAVIS: Me too.

02:40:48.812 --> 02:40:50.160
LAURA: Oh no!

02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:59.224
MATT: You watch as both of them fall to the ground
unconscious--

02:40:59.224 --> 02:41:00.769
LAURA: Oh, they're the only two that can bring our
people back!

02:41:00.769 --> 02:41:02.225
TALIESIN: I've got a healing potion.

02:41:02.225 --> 02:41:03.337
LAURA: I do.

02:41:03.337 --> 02:41:05.351
JENNIFER: We still have to kill this beast.

02:41:05.351 --> 02:41:10.018
(laughter and yelling)

02:41:10.018 --> 02:41:16.135
MATT: With your time traveling, as minor as it may
be, when you're facing death in the face here and

02:41:16.135 --> 02:41:18.669
you don't see much of a chance of victory at this
point--

02:41:18.669 --> 02:41:21.020
LIAM: So these two are down?

02:41:21.020 --> 02:41:21.998
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:41:21.998 --> 02:41:25.346
MATT: That ends the dragon's turn. Aerwin, it's
your turn.

02:41:25.346 --> 02:41:28.352
LIAM: Get the hell out of dodge.

02:41:28.352 --> 02:41:30.844
JENNIFER: We have to get them out, we have to get
everyone out.

02:41:30.844 --> 02:41:32.936
LAURA: Tell them you're sorry.

02:41:32.936 --> 02:41:34.443
JENNIFER: Sorry.

02:41:34.443 --> 02:41:39.072
MATT: (laughs) You have two allies currently on
the ground. One that's right next to you which is

02:41:39.072 --> 02:41:41.085
your big friend and--

02:41:41.085 --> 02:41:43.301
JENNIFER: I need to help him. What do I have that
can help them?

02:41:43.301 --> 02:41:45.094
MATT: You can try to grab and drag them if you
want to.

02:41:45.094 --> 02:41:46.872
JENNIFER: I'm going to grab and drag them.

02:41:46.872 --> 02:41:51.058
MATT: Okay. You grab them by the scruff of the
neck and begin pulling them across the way towards

02:41:51.058 --> 02:41:59.662
the direction of where they are. The flames as
they pour through barely miss and begin to catch

02:41:59.662 --> 02:42:09.024
fire. You're now inside an old mine shaft and the
archways have wooden supports in the mine shaft

02:42:09.024 --> 02:42:13.141
that are starting to catch fire. So you're
dragging him through. You get him right to the

02:42:13.141 --> 02:42:18.833
edge of the cavern using your movement and action
pulling him over there. The dragon's going to take

02:42:18.833 --> 02:42:26.017
one swipe at you as an attack of opportunity. Oh
that is a 13. What's your armor class?

02:42:26.017 --> 02:42:27.014
JENNIFER: 17.

02:42:27.014 --> 02:42:35.307
MATT: One big swipe barely misses you overhead and
you hear the wind over top as you barely duck

02:42:35.307 --> 02:42:39.013
below, drag him through the coin and get him to
the edge of the cavern. That's the end of your

02:42:39.013 --> 02:42:43.318
turn. That's going to bring us to Bundle! Make a
death saving throw please.

02:42:43.318 --> 02:42:45.382
TALIESIN: I'm cool.

02:42:45.382 --> 02:42:47.139
MATT: All right, cool. You're up.

02:42:47.139 --> 02:42:55.562
LIAM: Okay, this is bad. I'm stupid, but not that
stupid so I'm going to run towards these two, to

02:42:55.562 --> 02:43:01.649
dwarf, yes? And use action to cram potion healing
into his mouth. Wake him up.

02:43:01.649 --> 02:43:04.720
MATT: Okay. So you rush out, the dragon's going to
take a swipe at you as an attack of opportunity.

02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:06.467
LIAM: Okay.

02:43:06.467 --> 02:43:12.314
MATT: Actually, he already used a reaction on her,
yeah, so he cannot. So you go running, you get up

02:43:12.314 --> 02:43:15.344
to Bundle's body, drag him the rest of the way so
now you have both their bodies at the edge of the

02:43:15.344 --> 02:43:21.374
cavern entrance, the flames starting to curl in
this area. You put a healing potion-- What healing

02:43:21.374 --> 02:43:23.449
potion is it?

02:43:23.449 --> 02:43:26.641
LIAM: This is a potion of healing greater. 4d4
plus four.

02:43:26.641 --> 02:43:28.504
MATT: Okay. 4d4 plus four you heal.

02:43:28.504 --> 02:43:30.509
TALIESIN: 4d4 plus four (coughs).

02:43:30.509 --> 02:43:32.373
TRAVIS: Just you, right?

02:43:32.373 --> 02:43:33.567
LAURA: Yeah.

02:43:33.567 --> 02:43:35.149
MATT: Quazirat, that's the end of your turn.

02:43:35.149 --> 02:43:36.841
LIAM: That's the end of turn, yes.

02:43:36.841 --> 02:43:43.471
MATT: All right. That brings us to-- unless
there's anything else you want to do.

02:43:43.471 --> 02:43:52.036
LIAM: That was action. Wait, hold on. I will use
bonus action to do Second Wind on myself.

02:43:52.036 --> 02:43:54.221
MATT: Okay, sorry, didn't mean to cut you off
there, sorry.

02:43:54.221 --> 02:43:56.310
LIAM: No, that's fine. That's three, yes.

02:43:56.310 --> 02:44:02.901
MATT: All right, that brings us to Greldamine?
It's your turn. The rest of your allies come in,

02:44:02.901 --> 02:44:06.977
two of them being dragged in, burned and
unconscious. One of them slowly comes to

02:44:06.977 --> 02:44:10.735
consciousness as the potion is applied and the
dragon is in the room behind roaring now. The

02:44:10.735 --> 02:44:17.737
whole chamber shakes and quakes and you watch as
bits of rock begin to fall in the mine shaft that

02:44:17.737 --> 02:44:19.579
you're in. What are you doing?

02:44:19.579 --> 02:44:21.427
LAURA: Who else is still in the room?

02:44:21.427 --> 02:44:26.459
MATT: All of your allies haven't quite caught up
to you, they're about ten feet away from you, but

02:44:26.459 --> 02:44:28.793
they're coming into the tunnel that you're in.

02:44:28.793 --> 02:44:30.847
LAURA: Ten feet away? He is?

02:44:30.847 --> 02:44:31.794
MATT: Yes.

02:44:31.794 --> 02:44:35.164
LAURA: I'm going to run towards him because he's
still unconscious, he's being dragged, right?

02:44:35.164 --> 02:44:36.125
MATT: Correct.

02:44:36.125 --> 02:44:42.451
LAURA: I'm going to run towards him, ten feet,
give him a greater healing potion, 4d4 plus four.

02:44:42.451 --> 02:44:44.351
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, you roll that.

02:44:44.351 --> 02:44:46.129
LAURA: No, you roll it.

02:44:46.129 --> 02:44:48.739
MATT: Whichever, as long as somebody rolls, it's
fine.

02:44:48.739 --> 02:44:57.007
TRAVIS: Oh my god, I can't grab it. Stop it.
This is the slipperiest dice ever. Damn.

02:44:57.007 --> 02:44:59.237
12.

02:44:59.237 --> 02:45:03.455
LAURA: Plus four. 16. And then I'm going to use
the remainder of my movement to run back into the

02:45:03.455 --> 02:45:04.535
tunnel.

02:45:04.535 --> 02:45:08.767
MATT: You go rushing back down the tunnel.
(yelling)

02:45:08.767 --> 02:45:09.927
LAURA: (yelling)

02:45:09.927 --> 02:45:16.573
MATT: That brings us to your turn, Lohkor. You
come to consciousness coughing from the vial of

02:45:16.573 --> 02:45:18.096
healing potion.

02:45:18.096 --> 02:45:21.095
TRAVIS: (yelling) Double dash!

02:45:21.095 --> 02:45:27.315
MATT: Half of your movement to get up. Then you do
the rest of your movement and then dash. You go

02:45:27.315 --> 02:45:34.190
screaming past your gnome friend. You haven't seen
a person in plate move so quickly. That ends your

02:45:34.190 --> 02:45:40.866
turn. It is now the dragon's turn. To your luck,
the breath weapon does not regenerate. The dragon

02:45:40.866 --> 02:45:45.228
is going to take swipes at each of you. That's a
24 versus you.

02:45:45.228 --> 02:45:51.630
LIAM: Only hits a little bit, though.

02:45:51.630 --> 02:45:58.656
MATT: Okay. And then against you. That's a 15.

02:45:58.656 --> 02:45:59.812
JENNIFER: 17.

02:45:59.812 --> 02:46:06.683
MATT: As both claws strike out to slam into both
of you down on the ground, you manage to dive out

02:46:06.683 --> 02:46:11.525
of the way. You feel the impact behind you. You
almost don't get to your feet as you catch. You

02:46:11.525 --> 02:46:14.617
turn around, though, and you see the arms and legs
splayed underneath the dragon claws of your

02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:17.409
Draenei friend, Quazirat.

02:46:17.409 --> 02:46:20.550
LIAM: Everything's going to be fi--

02:46:20.550 --> 02:46:25.173
MATT: That is 15 points of slashing damage.

02:46:25.173 --> 02:46:26.687
LIAM: Yes, okay.

02:46:26.687 --> 02:46:29.250
LAURA: Are you still alive?

02:46:29.250 --> 02:46:31.857
LIAM: Yeah, you know, always living.

02:46:31.857 --> 02:46:34.741
MATT: There's no room in here to do a tail attack,
unfortunately. So it can't make that. That ends

02:46:34.741 --> 02:46:36.517
the dragon's turn. Your turn, Jennifer.

02:46:36.517 --> 02:46:39.454
JENNIFER: Okay. So I decide what we're going to
do?

02:46:39.454 --> 02:46:43.490
MATT: All your friends are running out that way.
The dragon seemingly can't get into this size of

02:46:43.490 --> 02:46:44.337
the chamber.

02:46:44.337 --> 02:46:45.442
JENNIFER: I'm running.

02:46:45.442 --> 02:46:46.934
MATT: You go bolting out there.

02:46:46.934 --> 02:46:48.371
LAURA: Good thing you got that dagger, though!

02:46:48.371 --> 02:46:49.521
JENNIFER: Yes!

02:46:49.521 --> 02:46:52.717
MATT: You're holding the dagger like, "Yay!"
(yelling) You go running and you catch up to the

02:46:52.717 --> 02:46:59.528
rest of them. You're bolting past the mage. Full
on double dash. You go past your paladin friend.

02:46:59.528 --> 02:47:03.537
That ends your turn. That brings us to Bundle.

02:47:03.537 --> 02:47:06.285
TALIESIN: I'm running. No, I'm out!

02:47:06.285 --> 02:47:11.772
MATT: You go bolting, dwarven legs catching up to
the rest of them. That brings us to the top.

02:47:11.772 --> 02:47:13.025
Quazirat?

02:47:13.025 --> 02:47:17.079
LIAM: I'm going to flee from the dragon.

02:47:17.079 --> 02:47:18.827
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

02:47:18.827 --> 02:47:20.804
LIAM: We'll see how we do!

02:47:20.804 --> 02:47:22.163
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

02:47:22.163 --> 02:47:23.468
TALIESIN: I'm so excited!

02:47:23.468 --> 02:47:26.004
LIAM: It's a big 13!

02:47:26.004 --> 02:47:28.323
MATT: Exactly? What's the DC on the sword?

02:47:28.323 --> 02:47:29.692
LIAM: 12.

02:47:29.692 --> 02:47:31.595
MATT: So you succeed!

02:47:31.595 --> 02:47:32.929
LIAM: Let's get the hell out of here, you guys!

02:47:32.929 --> 02:47:39.717
MATT: You resist the magical influence of the YOLO
that's thrown upon you by Adventure--

02:47:39.717 --> 02:47:44.021
LIAM: Blessed Blade of the Thrill Seeker.

02:47:44.021 --> 02:47:46.197
MATT: Adventurefury. Blessed Blade of the Thrill
Seeker.

02:47:46.197 --> 02:47:48.393
LIAM: Eh, too much hassle! Go!

02:47:48.393 --> 02:47:56.685
MATT: I believe he's wielding an adventure sword.
As you guys are bolting behind, rushing as fast as

02:47:56.685 --> 02:48:03.420
you can, you hear the rumbling and the roar of the
dragon and the heavy inhale once more. As the head

02:48:03.420 --> 02:48:10.496
begins to push its way into the cavern behind you,
the impact, the cavern shaking, you two who are

02:48:10.496 --> 02:48:16.760
running the fastest notice before anyone else
does, the ground gives out beneath you. You both

02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:22.207
go into a freefall as the strength of the ground
dissipates beneath your form. The rest of you see

02:48:22.207 --> 02:48:26.307
this happen just as you reach the edge and you
watch as the tunnel is falling and collapsing

02:48:26.307 --> 02:48:32.477
beneath you as you all begin to tumble down into
darkness. Right as that gout of fire is released,

02:48:32.477 --> 02:48:38.612
you watch above you as you spin into shadow, the
flames completely engulf the cavern where you once

02:48:38.612 --> 02:48:45.802
were. Strangely, the collapse saved you! As you
plummet down, whack! I need everyone to make an

02:48:45.802 --> 02:48:49.526
acrobatics check to see if you can manage to
lessen the impact of the fall.

02:48:49.526 --> 02:48:54.820
LAURA: Natural 20!

02:48:54.820 --> 02:48:56.767
TALIESIN: Not a natural 20, but 20.

02:48:56.767 --> 02:48:58.690
MATT: You take four points of bludgeoning damage.

02:48:58.690 --> 02:49:00.253
TRAVIS: 14.

02:49:00.253 --> 02:49:01.903
MATT: Four points of bludgeoning damage.

02:49:01.903 --> 02:49:02.847
TALIESIN: 20.

02:49:02.847 --> 02:49:04.223
MATT: Four points of bludgeoning damage.

02:49:04.223 --> 02:49:05.370
JENNIFER: 19.

02:49:05.370 --> 02:49:06.608
MATT: Four points of bludgeoning damage.

02:49:06.608 --> 02:49:07.927
LIAM: 24.

02:49:07.927 --> 02:49:10.206
MATT: Four points of bludgeoning damage. You guys
all managed to lessen the impact of the fall.

02:49:10.206 --> 02:49:11.803
LAURA: What happened to Reeksus?

02:49:11.803 --> 02:49:18.816
MATT: He is nowhere to be seen. Who knows what his
fate was. Probably very toasty.

02:49:18.816 --> 02:49:22.783
TRAVIS: Can I Cure Wounds on myself?

02:49:22.783 --> 02:49:23.805
MATT: Yeah!

02:49:23.805 --> 02:49:25.321
TRAVIS: Cure Wounds!

02:49:25.321 --> 02:49:33.195
MATT: Go for it. By the way, you now have that.

02:49:33.195 --> 02:49:37.159
LIAM: See what you got. Ooh!

02:49:37.159 --> 02:49:39.130
LAURA: Read it out loud!

02:49:39.130 --> 02:49:43.439
JENNIFER: Kingslayer. Dagger. Artifact. Requires
attunement slot. One-handed weapon. Once

02:49:43.439 --> 02:49:47.812
commissioned by the orc warlock Gul'dan for his
assassin Garona, this blade has seen many a death

02:49:47.812 --> 02:49:52.473
at its hands. One of a pair, the other has been
lost to time. You gain +3 to all attack and damage

02:49:52.473 --> 02:49:57.695
rolls made with this weapon. When you hit an
enemy, they suffer an extra 1d8 poison damage and

02:49:57.695 --> 02:50:03.181
make constitution save (DC 14) or become poisoned
until the end of your next turn.

02:50:03.181 --> 02:50:04.677
TALIESIN: That's mean!

02:50:04.677 --> 02:50:06.308
LAURA: Attune to that shit!

02:50:06.308 --> 02:50:07.864
JENNIFER: It was hard to get.

02:50:07.864 --> 02:50:09.642
TALIESIN: Worth it!

02:50:09.642 --> 02:50:13.689
LIAM: She needs 20 minutes with that. So we should
probably, you know.

02:50:13.689 --> 02:50:15.079
LAURA: We could rest up.

02:50:15.079 --> 02:50:17.905
TALIESIN: I'll do a Mass Healing Word.

02:50:17.905 --> 02:50:22.547
LAURA: Do you want to? Or we could use our hit
dice. If we take a short rest while she attunes.

02:50:22.547 --> 02:50:25.608
TALIESIN: We could use our hit dice, or I could
do, yeah.

02:50:25.608 --> 02:50:27.826
LAURA: We might need that later.

02:50:27.826 --> 02:50:29.488
TRAVIS: Yeah, do the hit dice.

02:50:29.488 --> 02:50:31.718
MATT: You guys glance around the space you're in.

02:50:31.718 --> 02:50:33.633
LAURA: Oh, yeah. We need to actually do that.

02:50:33.633 --> 02:50:39.619
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
you look around. What faint bit of light you carry

02:50:39.619 --> 02:50:42.973
with your torch light or the Light spell to look
around at the space around. You seem to have

02:50:42.973 --> 02:50:49.870
slipped down into a small crevasse that is
partially broken open. You're hidden in this

02:50:49.870 --> 02:50:54.853
small, collapsed portion where a lot of it is
filled with the loose rock. Beyond it, you can see

02:50:54.853 --> 02:51:00.195
a flickering, orange glow. As you approach and
glance up the side, make a perception check,

02:51:00.195 --> 02:51:01.885
whoever is at the front of that.

02:51:01.885 --> 02:51:14.628
TRAVIS: I've got it. Advantage. Blue fungus! That
was crap all around. Nine. Ten.

02:51:14.628 --> 02:51:16.806
LAURA: That's terrible.

02:51:16.806 --> 02:51:26.877
MATT: As you come inside, you see a circular
chamber. More hexagonal, I guess. Stone-built,

02:51:26.877 --> 02:51:31.257
constructed. Most everything else here has been
natural. This has some cavernous feel, but has

02:51:31.257 --> 02:51:39.493
some structure to it. This entire chamber is
filled with knickknacks, gold pieces, random

02:51:39.493 --> 02:51:49.463
boxes, collected odds and ends, and mounds of wax
ending in numerous lit candles. The entire

02:51:49.463 --> 02:51:55.606
chamber: hundreds of lit candles. The most
romantic of chambers you've seen. Large, small.

02:51:55.606 --> 02:52:03.630
This is the mass of where candle storage is for
this subterranean cavern network. That's all

02:52:03.630 --> 02:52:05.403
you're able to make out from this point.

02:52:05.403 --> 02:52:10.114
TRAVIS: Well, there's a shitload of wax ahead.

02:52:10.114 --> 02:52:13.494
LAURA: Should we sit down and heal ourselves?

02:52:13.494 --> 02:52:16.878
TRAVIS: Yeah. I think the coast is clear.

02:52:16.878 --> 02:52:20.602
LAURA: Okay.

02:52:20.602 --> 02:52:31.731
TALIESIN: Actually, I can do a thing that might
help. Where's the thing where I can make it so we

02:52:31.731 --> 02:52:36.611
all get max healing no matter what?

02:52:36.611 --> 02:52:40.146
MATT: That's a 3rd-level spell. That is--

02:52:40.146 --> 02:52:45.013
TALIESIN: Beacon of Hope?

02:52:45.013 --> 02:52:47.504
LAURA: No, I don't think you have it.

02:52:47.504 --> 02:52:58.419
TALIESIN: It's Beacon of Hope. So I'm going to
cast Beacon of Hope on everybody so for the next

02:52:58.419 --> 02:53:04.514
minute, I suppose it's just-- will this work for
hit dice?

02:53:04.514 --> 02:53:06.031
MATT: Not on hit dice, no.

02:53:06.031 --> 02:53:07.050
TALIESIN: Never mind.

02:53:07.050 --> 02:53:10.437
MATT: Beacon of Hope is for spells and effects
that heal you. The hit dice is resting for an

02:53:10.437 --> 02:53:12.742
extended period of time.

02:53:12.742 --> 02:53:16.249
TALIESIN: We'll just do the hit dice. It's been so
long!

02:53:16.249 --> 02:53:19.196
LIAM: Where are you at?

02:53:19.196 --> 02:53:30.561
LAURA: All right!

02:53:30.561 --> 02:53:39.357
TALIESIN: Wow, that was awful.

02:53:39.357 --> 02:53:42.469
LAURA: I'm back, baby!

02:53:42.469 --> 02:53:43.913
TALIESIN: Boy, I'm not.

02:53:43.913 --> 02:53:51.001
MATT: As you guys are completing your short rest,
a new sound perks your ears as you're resting. You

02:53:51.001 --> 02:53:59.845
all stop for a moment and listen. It's the sound
of a soft violin. Echoey. In the direction of

02:53:59.845 --> 02:54:02.189
where the candles are being stored.

02:54:02.189 --> 02:54:03.759
LAURA: Can I peek through the little thing?

02:54:03.759 --> 02:54:06.469
MATT: (violin playing) Make a perception check.

02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:10.165
LIAM: I don't like that music.

02:54:10.165 --> 02:54:11.381
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:54:11.381 --> 02:54:12.738
LIAM: I don't like it.

02:54:12.738 --> 02:54:15.936
LAURA: 17 plus five is 22.

02:54:15.936 --> 02:54:23.187
MATT: As you come to the edge and you glance past the
first few rows of wax and candle mounds, you can

02:54:23.187 --> 02:54:32.612
see in the distance a number of piles of collected
unlit candles that line the walls. To the back of

02:54:32.612 --> 02:54:40.523
this 30-foot diameter chamber, a large lump wax
throne stands, crowned with a dozen wide candles

02:54:40.523 --> 02:54:48.168
all flickering as they wreathe a sitting, larger,
more rotund than average kobold, wearing leather

02:54:48.168 --> 02:54:52.735
armor that cannot seem to contain his bulging
belly, now freed from the bursting leather plates

02:54:52.735 --> 02:54:59.035
around his torso. A white, wild chinstrap beard
marks his chin line, as a large metallic crown of

02:54:59.035 --> 02:55:06.138
cobbled golds, silvers, and iron adorn his head,
fused with a tall window lantern that shines

02:55:06.138 --> 02:55:12.622
brighter than a lantern should. You see shifting
movement from within the lantern, like the light

02:55:12.622 --> 02:55:20.818
source seems to be moving of its own accord,
almost alive. A smaller, elderly kobold stands

02:55:20.818 --> 02:55:28.812
next to this wax throne with a tiny violin, and
he's playing music as the kobold king sitting on

02:55:28.812 --> 02:55:34.936
the throne has his eyes partially closed,
listening. You see, through the shadows of the

02:55:34.936 --> 02:55:39.996
flickering candlelight, amongst the various piles
beyond your vision, apparently other kobolds are

02:55:39.996 --> 02:55:47.864
also in the chamber rummaging around, moving,
organizing, placing goods they've received. That's

02:55:47.864 --> 02:55:50.071
what you see.

02:55:50.071 --> 02:55:52.007
LAURA: How far away is the throne?

02:55:52.007 --> 02:55:54.354
MATT: It's about 25 feet from you.

02:55:54.354 --> 02:56:02.582
LAURA: (whispering) You guys, the king is right
there! Lots of other dudes in there too.

02:56:02.582 --> 02:56:06.936
TRAVIS: Does the staff have any suggestions?

02:56:06.936 --> 02:56:13.015
LAURA: Hey, Aluneth! Should we attack?

02:56:13.015 --> 02:56:22.383
MATT: "If you feel confident in your power, then
destroy them and siphon their magic. Feed on what

02:56:22.383 --> 02:56:24.132
"power they've got."

02:56:24.132 --> 02:56:25.637
LAURA: Can I do that with you?

02:56:25.637 --> 02:56:27.847
MATT: "Of course, my darling."

02:56:27.847 --> 02:56:30.641
JENNIFER: What's he saying?

02:56:30.641 --> 02:56:34.409
LAURA: Aluneth is saying: destroy them!

02:56:34.409 --> 02:56:36.335
JENNIFER: Can you do that?

02:56:36.335 --> 02:56:37.521
LAURA: I don't know.

02:56:37.521 --> 02:56:39.372
MATT: "Can you do that?"

02:56:39.372 --> 02:56:40.541
LAURA: Yeah!

02:56:40.541 --> 02:56:43.487
MATT: "Then prove that you're worthy of my
gifts."

02:56:43.487 --> 02:56:52.044
LAURA: Yeah! Should I do a Fireball at the king?

02:56:52.044 --> 02:56:54.780
TRAVIS: Who's playing the violin?

02:56:54.780 --> 02:56:57.624
LAURA: An old kobold next to him.

02:56:57.624 --> 02:56:59.811
TRAVIS: I thought it was a little gnome?

02:56:59.811 --> 02:57:04.851
MATT: It's a tiny, elderly kobold who's like
(squeaky violin music)

02:57:04.851 --> 02:57:14.246
LIAM: I've seen you two in action. What if she
fires and you follow with fire?

02:57:14.246 --> 02:57:18.400
LAURA: I'll let her do the first attack, because
you get assassinate, and then I'm going to

02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:20.692
Fireball immediately after that.

02:57:20.692 --> 02:57:23.045
TALIESIN: And I'll Sacred Flame as well.

02:57:23.045 --> 02:57:32.146
JENNIFER: Am I assassinating the king? Should we
assess first the power of these other kobold

02:57:32.146 --> 02:57:33.476
around him?

02:57:33.476 --> 02:57:34.249
LAURA: Fuck it!

02:57:34.249 --> 02:57:39.554
JENNIFER: All right, let's do it. Eyes on the
prize. Crossbow's ready.

02:57:39.554 --> 02:57:45.190
MATT: Make a stealth check as you approach the
edge and begin to get to a place where you can--

02:57:45.190 --> 02:57:47.552
JENNIFER: 19.

02:57:47.552 --> 02:57:52.887
LIAM: No, it's not, it's much higher. 30.

02:57:52.887 --> 02:58:00.740
MATT: You feel comfortable enough stepping from
the crack in the wall, and then diving below the

02:58:00.740 --> 02:58:07.736
first row of large, heavy, wax mounds. You ready
your crossbow across your forearm, aiming it for

02:58:07.736 --> 02:58:15.477
the king's soft under throat. As you prepare
yourself, the music comes to a halt from the

02:58:15.477 --> 02:58:29.813
violinist, and the king turns to him. "Thank you.
This earthquake has made me ever so nervous." Do

02:58:29.813 --> 02:58:33.390
you take your shot? You have advantage on your
attack, so you get to roll twice.

02:58:33.390 --> 02:58:40.845
LIAM: That's cocked. So what's the higher one?

02:58:40.845 --> 02:58:44.708
JENNIFER: 27.

02:58:44.708 --> 02:58:48.044
MATT: That definitely hits, go ahead and roll
damage.

02:58:48.044 --> 02:58:49.911
JENNIFER: That's this one?

02:58:49.911 --> 02:59:01.867
LIAM: You're doing crossbow? 1d6. Roll a cube.
Three plus your sneak attack damage. And we're

02:59:01.867 --> 02:59:06.199
going to double this when you're done, because
you're an assassin hitting in the dark.

02:59:06.199 --> 02:59:08.748
MATT: It is considered a critical hit because he
is unaware.

02:59:08.748 --> 02:59:21.388
LIAM: (counting) 37, because you're an assassin.

02:59:21.388 --> 02:59:23.808
LAURA: Fireball!

02:59:23.808 --> 02:59:32.772
MATT: (choking) It reaches up and turns as you
release the Fireball into the room. The violinist

02:59:32.772 --> 02:59:42.917
starts playing again, looks back and barely pulls
the bow away and goes, "Oh no!" as the entire room

02:59:42.917 --> 02:59:46.435
bursts into flame. Go ahead and roll your 8d6
damage.

02:59:46.435 --> 02:59:48.576
LIAM: Every kobold is the best in this game.

02:59:48.576 --> 03:00:08.173
LAURA: How many? 8d6? Oh jeez. 24.

03:00:08.173 --> 03:00:11.110
MATT: Okay, so 24.

03:00:11.110 --> 03:00:16.687
LAURA: Oh! Plus two! 26, because I'm attacking
with Aluneth.

03:00:16.687 --> 03:00:32.433
MATT: Four of the ten kobolds in the room are
destroyed as the explosion hits. You hear a bunch

03:00:32.433 --> 03:00:37.539
of screams in the corner as a number of them are
annihilated. As you can see, the throne itself is

03:00:37.539 --> 03:00:47.742
melting in the wake of it. King Togwaggle. A three
does not make it. So that's 26 fire damage to him.

03:00:47.742 --> 03:01:01.367
And the violinist is ashes. As the flames subside,
you watch as there's a kobold shaped skeleton

03:01:01.367 --> 03:01:10.572
clutching a now burning violin that tumbles into a
pile on the ground. At which point, the other

03:01:10.572 --> 03:01:15.490
kobolds jump out, damaged and burning looking to
King Togwaggle as he's sitting there, the edges of

03:01:15.490 --> 03:01:22.236
his chin beard burning and curled up. He has this
giant shovel that he has resting at his side. And

03:01:22.236 --> 03:01:34.548
he glances up at his crown and goes "Rakanishu, it
looks like company we has. And You! No! Take!

03:01:34.548 --> 03:01:40.266
"Candle!" Slams the shovel onto the ground and
stands up. Everyone roll initiative.

03:01:40.266 --> 03:01:46.442
TRAVIS: Oh my god. What the hell? What's
Rakanishu?

03:01:46.442 --> 03:02:00.434
MATT: All righty. Wow, okay. So, 25 to 20,
anybody?

03:02:00.434 --> 03:02:01.609
LAURA: 22.

03:02:01.609 --> 03:02:02.753
TALIESIN: 21!

03:02:02.753 --> 03:02:03.900
MATT: Oh wow, look at that!

03:02:03.900 --> 03:02:05.059
TALIESIN: It finally happened.

03:02:05.059 --> 03:02:06.508
TRAVIS: "Finally happened."

03:02:06.508 --> 03:02:15.335
MATT: All righty. Then 20 to 15?

03:02:15.335 --> 03:02:16.631
TRAVIS: 18.

03:02:16.631 --> 03:02:21.156
MATT: 15 to ten?

03:02:21.156 --> 03:02:22.630
JENNIFER: 13.

03:02:22.630 --> 03:02:24.412
LIAM: Big ten, my man.

03:02:24.412 --> 03:02:35.544
MATT: All right. Greldamine, you're up first. You
finished shooting the fireball, they're all now

03:02:35.544 --> 03:02:39.705
pulling out pickaxes and going (yelling) and
they're all turning. They can see you and they can

03:02:39.705 --> 03:02:44.991
see you and the rest of you, currently now
stuck in this hole in the wall right now. You're

03:02:44.991 --> 03:02:47.149
all locked in this pincered position.

03:02:47.149 --> 03:02:48.596
LIAM: Let's go, wee one.

03:02:48.596 --> 03:02:52.791
LAURA: Okay, ooh. How close are they all to each
other?

03:02:52.791 --> 03:02:55.982
MATT: They're all about 15 feet from each other.

03:02:55.982 --> 03:02:57.966
LAURA: Fireball!

03:02:57.966 --> 03:03:17.334
MATT: All right! Roll the damage. Togwaggle does
make his save this time.

03:03:17.334 --> 03:03:22.735
LAURA: 34.

03:03:22.735 --> 03:03:30.855
MATT: 34, all right. So that's 17 points of fire
damage to Togwaggle. And the rest of the kobolds

03:03:30.855 --> 03:03:34.809
(explosion) (screaming). Annihilated.

03:03:34.809 --> 03:03:36.773
TRAVIS: The one syllable protest!

03:03:36.773 --> 03:03:45.605
MATT: Their pickaxes tumble off and some are stuck
into the stonework. Surrounding, beginning to melt

03:03:45.605 --> 03:03:50.293
wax elements have now melted even further and are
now beginning to coat the ground with soft molten

03:03:50.293 --> 03:03:55.215
wax. The entire chamber is now becoming a sticky
wax base.

03:03:55.215 --> 03:03:58.658
LAURA: Oh. I may have melted all of our loot that
we were supposed to take back.

03:03:58.658 --> 03:04:01.288
LIAM: It'll form back together though.

03:04:01.288 --> 03:04:07.979
LAURA: Yeah, he's getting his wax back, that's the
important part! I am going to back away from the

03:04:07.979 --> 03:04:11.403
little crack in the wall and hide against the
wall.

03:04:11.403 --> 03:04:13.424
MATT: So you're now moving out of the crack of the
wall and moving into the chamber?

03:04:13.424 --> 03:04:14.451
LAURA: No.

03:04:14.451 --> 03:04:18.933
MATT: There's a giant, hexagonal, circular
chamber, and the small crack in the wall where you

03:04:18.933 --> 03:04:20.294
guys were hiding.

03:04:20.294 --> 03:04:21.658
LAURA: All of us in this teeny crack?

03:04:21.658 --> 03:04:24.438
MATT: Yes. Except for you, you're actually outside
of it and by one of the mounds that is slowly

03:04:24.438 --> 03:04:25.526
melting in front of you.

03:04:25.526 --> 03:04:31.995
LAURA: Okay, I guess I will step outside of the
crack and try to hide behind a mound of

03:04:31.995 --> 03:04:32.896
something.

03:04:32.896 --> 03:04:35.931
MATT: Okay, so you dart off to one of the mounds.
You don't have any action to do a hide check,

03:04:35.931 --> 03:04:40.254
unfortunately. Using it for cover, hopefully. That
ends your turn. Bundle, you're up.

03:04:40.254 --> 03:04:41.990
LIAM: Everybody say crack as much as you can.

03:04:41.990 --> 03:04:43.715
ALL: Crack!

03:04:43.715 --> 03:04:53.287
TALIESIN: Just for fun, let's do-- where is it? I
keep losing everything I'm doing. I'm going to do a

03:04:53.287 --> 03:05:05.448
very standard Guiding Bolt. And a Sacred Flame
attack. I'm going to go for a two-fer on the big

03:05:05.448 --> 03:05:07.013
kahuna.

03:05:07.013 --> 03:05:08.309
MATT: Those are technically both actions.

03:05:08.309 --> 03:05:19.427
TALIESIN: Oh they're both actions? I thought it
was a bonus, never mind. This is so hard to do,

03:05:19.427 --> 03:05:21.017
it's been so long since I've done this.

03:05:21.017 --> 03:05:23.203
MATT: It's okay. Guiding Bolt?

03:05:23.203 --> 03:05:25.569
LAURA: (singing) Guiding Bolt up the butt!

03:05:25.569 --> 03:05:30.554
TALIESIN: I'll do a standard Guiding Bolt at this
guy, and see what happens.

03:05:30.554 --> 03:05:33.033
MATT: Okay. Make a ranged spell attack against
King Togwaggle.

03:05:33.033 --> 03:05:37.867
TALIESIN: Here we go, Guiding Bolt. That's a 19.

03:05:37.867 --> 03:05:39.194
MATT: Plus?

03:05:39.194 --> 03:05:41.510
TALIESIN: Guiding Bolt is a 25.

03:05:41.510 --> 03:05:43.056
MATT: That'll hit, go ahead and roll damage.

03:05:43.056 --> 03:05:55.391
TALIESIN: That's 4d6 radiant. Ooh! 16 points of
radiant damage.

03:05:55.391 --> 03:06:01.544
MATT: Okay, and the next hit against him has
advantage.

03:06:01.544 --> 03:06:08.028
TALIESIN: Yeah, the next hit against him has
advantage, and yeah, I'm going to give myself a

03:06:08.028 --> 03:06:10.982
quick Healing Word as a bonus action because I'm
really low.

03:06:10.982 --> 03:06:18.569
MATT: Okay. As a reaction, King Togwaggle's going
to go ahead and use Vengeance of Rakanishu. After

03:06:18.569 --> 03:06:24.607
the Guiding Bolt slams into King Togwaggle, he
lifts up his giant shovel in his hand and you

03:06:24.607 --> 03:06:30.862
watch as the interior of the lantern crown that he
has begins to brighten and suddenly your chest

03:06:30.862 --> 03:06:42.550
bursts into flame. You suffer 14 points of fire
damage and you are considered on fire. Until you

03:06:42.550 --> 03:06:45.536
spend an action to put it out, you're going to
take 1d6 fire damage every turn.

03:06:45.536 --> 03:06:51.245
TALIESIN: All right. I am at 29 points of health,
that's okay.

03:06:51.245 --> 03:06:52.519
MATT: All righty, so that ends your turn?

03:06:52.519 --> 03:06:53.547
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:06:53.547 --> 03:06:57.554
MATT: All right, suddenly you watch across the
chamber which you hadn't noticed before, there is

03:06:57.554 --> 03:07:02.281
a door that slams open and from the inside, from
what little of bit you can see it looks like some

03:07:02.281 --> 03:07:13.712
sort of a latrine or like an open piss pot room.
Four kobolds start rushing out into the center of

03:07:13.712 --> 03:07:16.711
the chamber, their feet getting stuck in the wax,
so they'll only be able to move at half their

03:07:16.711 --> 03:07:21.302
speed so they can't get up to anybody. They take
their pickaxes and throw them! So they're going to

03:07:21.302 --> 03:07:29.175
throw three at you and three at you. Technically
you guys would both have a little bit of cover

03:07:29.175 --> 03:07:33.385
because you're behind those, so I'd give a plus
two to your AC for each of you. So the first three

03:07:33.385 --> 03:07:38.722
against you. That is going to be a 16, what's your
armor class?

03:07:38.722 --> 03:07:41.059
LAURA: I did Mage Armor, so I've got 16.

03:07:41.059 --> 03:07:46.941
MATT: Correct, so with the plus two, it does not
hit. The first one is deflected off the armor. Oh,

03:07:46.941 --> 03:07:53.477
that's going to be a natural 19, so that hits you.
You suffer nine points of piercing damage as one

03:07:53.477 --> 03:07:58.233
pickaxe hits you in the chest, clavicle area,
you're like (grunt). The third one's going to

03:07:58.233 --> 03:08:00.518
throw and that is a 19.

03:08:00.518 --> 03:08:05.189
LAURA: That hits.

03:08:05.189 --> 03:08:09.927
MATT: So you take seven points piercing damage
from a second pickaxe that jams you in like the

03:08:09.927 --> 03:08:17.567
hip area, it falls out, but the wound's open. The
three against you. That's going to be a 15 plus

03:08:17.567 --> 03:08:19.034
four, that's 19?

03:08:19.034 --> 03:08:21.148
JENNIFER: I'm 17, I don't have any pluses, right?

03:08:21.148 --> 03:08:22.479
LAURA: Plus two!

03:08:22.479 --> 03:08:23.841
JENNIFER: Okay, so 19.

03:08:23.841 --> 03:08:27.745
MATT: Plus two, so 19, so it hits you exactly. So
you take six points of piercing damage as one

03:08:27.745 --> 03:08:33.374
pickaxe grazes you across the neck and shoulder.
It hurts, you can feel the welt picking up. Second

03:08:33.374 --> 03:08:40.201
one is going to go ahead and strike you, that is
going to be an 11. So, no. That one you dodge out

03:08:40.201 --> 03:08:45.411
of the way, and a third and final one is going to
come for you. That is a natural 20! As you dodge

03:08:45.411 --> 03:08:51.875
out of the way and come around, there is one that
takes both hands (grunt) (whooshing) and as you

03:08:51.875 --> 03:08:59.642
spin around to hear the scream it hits you right
in the forehead. That's a six, that's 12, plus

03:08:59.642 --> 03:09:05.193
three. You take 15 points of piercing damage as
your head is ringing from the impact of the

03:09:05.193 --> 03:09:09.328
pickaxe. Your vision blurs and doubles for a
second as you right yourself and clutch onto the

03:09:09.328 --> 03:09:16.052
soft wax. You fall into a little bit, and pull
yourself out. That's going to end the kobolds'

03:09:16.052 --> 03:09:32.050
turn, now it's King Togwaggle's turn. King
Togwaggle is going to rush forward, currently it's

03:09:32.050 --> 03:09:35.206
only the three of you visible because nobody's
come out of the chamber yet. So he's going to rush

03:09:35.206 --> 03:09:41.536
forward and get between the two of you and make a
shovel strike on each of you. So the first one

03:09:41.536 --> 03:09:43.938
against you, that's a 27.

03:09:43.938 --> 03:09:45.475
LAURA: Oh god!

03:09:45.475 --> 03:09:48.032
MATT: I rolled a natural 19. You take--

03:09:48.032 --> 03:09:54.028
LAURA: He's at disadvantage though, because I'm a
gnome. I'm very small.

03:09:54.028 --> 03:10:03.845
MATT: No. That is 15 points of damage, as the
shovel hits you upside your head, and then

03:10:03.845 --> 03:10:11.651
attacking you. That is a 16 plus eight, that's 24.
That hits you. That's an eight plus six, that's 14

03:10:11.651 --> 03:10:13.453
points of bludgeoning damage.

03:10:13.453 --> 03:10:14.776
TALIESIN: (groans)

03:10:14.776 --> 03:10:19.153
MATT: Ending their turn, it now comes to you.

03:10:19.153 --> 03:10:23.483
TRAVIS: Can I push out of the crevice and run at
King Togwaggle?

03:10:23.483 --> 03:10:27.288
MATT: You push out and he's right there. You guys
are all clustered right on the outside so he's

03:10:27.288 --> 03:10:28.631
easily within range.

03:10:28.631 --> 03:10:29.647
TRAVIS: I can get right on him?

03:10:29.647 --> 03:10:30.613
MATT: Yeah.

03:10:30.613 --> 03:10:33.614
TRAVIS: Can I use my Hammer of Justice, "Target a
creature within 15 feet of you to make a

03:10:33.614 --> 03:10:37.611
"constitution saving throw against your spell save
DC or become stunned until the next round" on my

03:10:37.611 --> 03:10:39.019
next turn?

03:10:39.019 --> 03:10:43.554
MATT: Yes you can. All right, so. That is an 11.
What's your--

03:10:43.554 --> 03:10:44.766
TRAVIS: 13! Yes!

03:10:44.766 --> 03:10:51.859
MATT: So as you step out of the crevice, you
summon the radiant energy granted to you from the

03:10:51.859 --> 03:10:57.762
divine, and you watch as this giant radiant
hammer, summoned from the sky, slams down and

03:10:57.762 --> 03:11:04.412
strikes the top of King Togwaggle's head. The
crown goes off to the side for a second and he's

03:11:04.412 --> 03:11:10.908
like (grunting). He can't make words, his bell is
rung. So he's stunned until the end of your next

03:11:10.908 --> 03:11:11.919
turn.

03:11:11.919 --> 03:11:12.985
TRAVIS: Yeah!

03:11:12.985 --> 03:11:16.776
MATT: All right, that's your action. You're there
and you're up engaged with him. That finishes your

03:11:16.776 --> 03:11:20.511
turn. All right, you're up, Aerwin.

03:11:20.511 --> 03:11:23.485
LAURA: With stunned, if you hit him does it break
the stun? Or he's--

03:11:23.485 --> 03:11:28.201
MATT: No, he's stunned, and attacks against him
have advantage and melee attacks against him I'll

03:11:28.201 --> 03:11:30.466
double check, I'm pretty sure auto-crit.

03:11:30.466 --> 03:11:32.798
TRAVIS: Do I get a bonus action with that crazy
move or is that it?

03:11:32.798 --> 03:11:34.032
MATT: You do, if you want to use a bonus action.

03:11:34.032 --> 03:11:36.836
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want to pour some Searing Smite
into it as well.

03:11:36.836 --> 03:11:42.868
MATT: I'll let you do that, sure. Well, it's not
a melee weapon attack, I think, unfortunately.

03:11:42.868 --> 03:11:45.737
TRAVIS: Oh that's right, never mind. That's what
it is, your call.

03:11:45.737 --> 03:11:48.431
MATT: Stunned, incapacitated. Yep, so as an
incapacitated creature, yeah.

03:11:48.431 --> 03:11:50.749
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:11:50.749 --> 03:11:55.774
LAURA: So you guys, melee attacks are auto-crits on
him right now.

03:11:55.774 --> 03:12:00.466
LIAM: Okay, and your buddy is there so--

03:12:00.466 --> 03:12:03.438
LAURA: Dagger, dagger, dagger!

03:12:03.438 --> 03:12:06.212
LIAM: Not hidden, can't do that, but you're still
going to get sneak attack.

03:12:06.212 --> 03:12:08.587
JENNIFER: Dagger, I want to do the dagger.

03:12:08.587 --> 03:12:15.206
LIAM: Yeah, you're going for an attack. Is she at
advantage because he's stunned and weird?

03:12:15.206 --> 03:12:16.406
MATT: Yes.

03:12:16.406 --> 03:12:18.172
LAURA: It's an auto-crit!

03:12:18.172 --> 03:12:20.333
LIAM: So roll twice. Oh auto-crit, so you don't
even have to roll.

03:12:20.333 --> 03:12:22.014
LAURA: Yeah you do, you have to roll to see if it
hits.

03:12:22.014 --> 03:12:24.282
LIAM: Well, yeah you hit, 16 plus eight, so 24.

03:12:24.282 --> 03:12:28.209
MATT: 24 definitely hits. I'm checking to make
sure I do this right.

03:12:28.209 --> 03:12:30.236
LIAM: So you roll--

03:12:30.236 --> 03:12:32.760
JENNIFER: 1d4?

03:12:32.760 --> 03:12:38.133
LIAM: 1d4, which is the triangle, the pyramid.
Roll that. Okay, now you roll your-- four, good.

03:12:38.133 --> 03:12:41.218
Roll these guys. Okay, roll those.

03:12:41.218 --> 03:12:44.521
JENNIFER: Okay, all right.

03:12:44.521 --> 03:12:47.266
LIAM: Holy shit, that's a good sneak attack.

03:12:47.266 --> 03:12:48.981
JENNIFER: 22.

03:12:48.981 --> 03:12:57.514
LIAM: 22, wait, you double it, because it's an
auto-crit, so 22, 44 plus the three, is 47.

03:12:57.514 --> 03:12:59.682
LAURA: Plus the poison damage?

03:12:59.682 --> 03:13:03.838
MATT: Plus a d8, which is doubled because it's an
auto-crit, so roll a d8.

03:13:03.838 --> 03:13:05.502
LIAM: Oh, you have smoked this guy.

03:13:05.502 --> 03:13:07.616
LAURA: Yeah, that one, that one.

03:13:07.616 --> 03:13:09.406
JENNIFER: Five.

03:13:09.406 --> 03:13:10.734
LIAM: Ten.

03:13:10.734 --> 03:13:13.443
57.

03:13:13.647 --> 03:13:17.539
TRAVIS: Jesus, 57 points?

03:13:17.539 --> 03:13:23.832
MATT: So using the dagger you mustered from
beneath the dragon, you jam it right up into the

03:13:23.832 --> 03:13:29.834
abdomen of King Togwaggle and while stunned he
goes (choking) and you watch as some of his brackish

03:13:29.834 --> 03:13:35.157
blood (splattering) out of his mouth. He looks
hurt, but is very angry. While still stunned in

03:13:35.157 --> 03:13:39.107
place, his eyes have locked in on you. You can see
the bloodshot look behind the whites. He goes,

03:13:39.107 --> 03:13:48.005
"No. Take. Candle." Is that your turn?

03:13:48.005 --> 03:13:52.611
JENNIFER: Is that the end of my turn? That's the
end of my turn.

03:13:52.611 --> 03:13:55.813
LIAM: Yes, you can disengage as bonus action and
get away from him so he can't hurt you.

03:13:55.813 --> 03:13:57.429
JENNIFER: I'll do that.

03:13:57.429 --> 03:13:58.175
LIAM: Dance back.

03:13:58.175 --> 03:13:59.472
JENNIFER: I'll dance back.

03:13:59.472 --> 03:14:02.457
MATT: He's stunned, he can't even attack her. So
you move away from him. All right, so you pull

03:14:02.457 --> 03:14:07.080
away, pulling the blade out from the wound which
now is like (dripping sound). Ending your turn,

03:14:07.080 --> 03:14:08.192
you're up.

03:14:08.192 --> 03:14:10.641
LIAM: How far away are other little guys from this
one?

03:14:10.641 --> 03:14:13.576
MATT: They're about ten feet behind him, in the
center.

03:14:13.576 --> 03:14:18.785
LIAM: Ten feet behind him? Then I will use my
whirlwind warrior class ability, and I will start

03:14:18.785 --> 03:14:21.421
with the big man and move to his little buddies.

03:14:21.421 --> 03:14:22.417
MATT: Okay.

03:14:22.417 --> 03:14:23.789
LIAM: Okay? So here we go.

03:14:23.789 --> 03:14:28.131
MATT: So as an action you can make an attack
against each creature that you come adjacent to.

03:14:28.131 --> 03:14:36.065
LIAM: So I'll start with him, yeah? So I get two
attacks because of who I am, that is 16? Not

03:14:36.065 --> 03:14:36.823
great.

03:14:36.823 --> 03:14:40.301
MATT: You don't get two attacks of part of this,
you get one attack against each thing you go

03:14:40.301 --> 03:14:41.696
across.

03:14:41.696 --> 03:14:42.632
LIAM: Okay.

03:14:42.632 --> 03:14:44.035
MATT: So you get one attack on him.

03:14:44.035 --> 03:14:45.216
LIAM: So am I at advantage because he's fucked
up?

03:14:45.216 --> 03:14:46.360
MATT: Yes.

03:14:46.360 --> 03:14:50.311
LIAM: Okay good. That's better, that's 24 to hit,
that hits.

03:14:50.311 --> 03:14:51.868
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

03:14:51.868 --> 03:14:53.241
LIAM: Okay, here we go again.

03:14:53.241 --> 03:14:56.015
MATT: And I'll say with your movement, moving
through you can hit four of the six kobolds.

03:14:56.015 --> 03:15:03.896
LIAM: Okay great. 14 on this guy. Keep going?

03:15:03.896 --> 03:15:08.838
MATT: So you're shifting on and you watch as
Quazirat suddenly grabs his blade and begins

03:15:08.838 --> 03:15:14.849
spinning in a circle. You guys have to duck out of
the way as he carves into King Togwaggle, carves

03:15:14.849 --> 03:15:18.969
through a bunch of the wax and begins burning into
the center of the chamber and cleaves through,

03:15:18.969 --> 03:15:20.482
hopefully, four of these kobolds.

03:15:20.482 --> 03:15:26.314
LIAM: Ever hear of Baryshnikov? Amateur. Do I roll
for attack on each one?

03:15:26.314 --> 03:15:27.432
MATT: Yes, you do.

03:15:27.432 --> 03:15:32.356
LIAM: Okay, here we go. First one, we get 18.

03:15:32.356 --> 03:15:33.548
MATT: Hits.

03:15:33.548 --> 03:15:38.304
LIAM: Second one, we get natural 20. Third one we
get one.

03:15:38.304 --> 03:15:39.482
MATT: Nope.

03:15:39.482 --> 03:15:43.620
LIAM: Fourth one we get 28.

03:15:43.620 --> 03:15:45.844
MATT: Three of them hit, one of them is a
critical.

03:15:45.844 --> 03:15:51.327
LIAM: Okay, so first one we get 18.

03:15:51.327 --> 03:15:52.514
MATT: 18 damage?

03:15:52.514 --> 03:15:53.720
LIAM: Yeah.

03:15:53.720 --> 03:15:56.516
MATT: The first one you cleave the head off.
(squeal)

03:15:56.516 --> 03:16:02.473
LIAM: Okay, so second one critical so eight, 16,
18, 24.

03:16:02.473 --> 03:16:08.339
MATT: That one, the blade bisects him from hip to
chest and he stumbles forward to the ground in two

03:16:08.339 --> 03:16:09.242
pieces.

03:16:09.242 --> 03:16:11.394
LIAM: Oh buddy. And the last one, 14.

03:16:11.394 --> 03:16:19.607
MATT: 14. That one the blade stops in his body and
he's like (choking) "Why?"

03:16:19.607 --> 03:16:22.631
LIAM: Life comes at you fast.

03:16:22.631 --> 03:16:30.583
MATT: (growling) All right. That ends your turn.

03:16:30.583 --> 03:16:31.983
LIAM: Sure does.

03:16:31.983 --> 03:16:35.390
MATT: All right. Greldamine, your turn.

03:16:35.390 --> 03:16:40.632
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to try and take his crown
off his head since he's stunned.

03:16:40.632 --> 03:16:45.163
MATT: Okay, what are you going to do, are you
going to grab and pull it off?

03:16:45.163 --> 03:16:45.887
LAURA: Yeah!

03:16:45.887 --> 03:16:47.069
MATT: Okay.

03:16:47.069 --> 03:16:51.783
LAURA: Oh wait, no! Can I use Mage Hand to do it?
Is that what Mage Hand does?

03:16:51.783 --> 03:16:56.215
MATT: If you want to do that roll an athletics
check. Sorry, not an athletics, an arcana check to

03:16:56.215 --> 03:16:57.970
see if you can manage to pull it off.

03:16:57.970 --> 03:17:04.028
LAURA: 15?

03:17:04.028 --> 03:17:10.480
MATT: 15. You watch as the crown comes off and is
now floating there as you're holding it with the

03:17:10.480 --> 03:17:11.853
Mage Hand.

03:17:11.853 --> 03:17:19.070
LAURA: I got his crown! I'm going to run across
the room with the Mage Hand following behind me

03:17:19.070 --> 03:17:24.307
and start trying to bury it in wax on the other
side of the room.

03:17:24.307 --> 03:17:27.676
MATT: Okay. So you're holding it in the air and
trying to dig a hole in the soft wax?

03:17:27.676 --> 03:17:28.627
LAURA: Yeah.

03:17:28.627 --> 03:17:30.830
MATT: That will end your turn, Bundle, you're up.

03:17:30.830 --> 03:17:33.974
TALIESIN: It's going to take an action to put
myself out, I assume.

03:17:33.974 --> 03:17:35.575
MATT: If you want to put yourself out.

03:17:35.575 --> 03:17:36.899
TALIESIN: I would like to put myself out.

03:17:36.899 --> 03:17:39.693
MATT: At top of the round, you do take three
points of fire damage.

03:17:39.693 --> 03:17:41.456
LIAM: Stop, drop and roll.

03:17:41.456 --> 03:17:42.269
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:17:42.269 --> 03:17:44.380
MATT: You spend the round (yelping), putting the
fire out on you.

03:17:44.380 --> 03:17:45.701
TALIESIN: Do I get a bonus action?

03:17:45.701 --> 03:17:46.848
MATT: You do.

03:17:46.848 --> 03:17:50.955
TALIESIN: So for a bonus action I'm going to cast
Spiritual Weapon at 4th-level, because I think

03:17:50.955 --> 03:17:52.830
that gives me an extra d8 for spiritual weapon.

03:17:52.830 --> 03:17:54.027
MATT: It does, yes.

03:17:54.027 --> 03:17:55.582
TALIESIN: All right, so I'm going to cast
Spiritual Weapon.

03:17:55.582 --> 03:17:56.775
MATT: And what are you summoning?

03:17:56.775 --> 03:18:02.831
TALIESIN: I basically want to summon what is
basically a big chomping mouse trap.

03:18:02.831 --> 03:18:05.961
MATT: (laughing) All right.

03:18:05.961 --> 03:18:08.117
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a whack at the king's
head with a giant--

03:18:08.117 --> 03:18:13.731
MATT: A divine mouse trap. It's beautifully
carved, from ivory it looks like. The silver

03:18:13.731 --> 03:18:20.372
snapping mechanism, it looks like it was of elven
make. It has filigree on it. As it appears you

03:18:20.372 --> 03:18:25.321
hear this chorus go (angelic singing) as it
prepares itself.

03:18:25.321 --> 03:18:28.374
TALIESIN: I'm going to smack it right into him.
Does it auto-crit, if it hits?

03:18:28.374 --> 03:18:31.815
MATT: It's advantage on the attack and I think
it'll be an auto-crit.

03:18:31.815 --> 03:18:35.945
TALIESIN: Oh, it's also advantage on the attack. I
rolled a 17 plus--

03:18:35.945 --> 03:18:37.833
LAURA: Well you could get a 20.

03:18:37.833 --> 03:18:42.815
TALIESIN: Yeah, 23, but it's an auto-crit anyway.

03:18:42.815 --> 03:18:45.189
LAURA: Isn't it? It's an auto-crit?

03:18:45.189 --> 03:19:00.184
TALIESIN: He's still stunned. So that's 26 points
of damage. (snapping)

03:19:00.184 --> 03:19:10.253
MATT: You watch as it snaps down and more blood
spills out. And you hear the snapping of a bone

03:19:10.253 --> 03:19:17.278
and one eye closes in pain. He's still standing
there and is furiously awaiting his return.

03:19:17.278 --> 03:19:22.047
TALIESIN: I'm going to back up a bit, with my
movement. And get a little bit of cover.

03:19:22.047 --> 03:19:33.791
MATT: The four kobolds see you running by with the
crown gliding. They go "No! Rakanishu! Save it!"

03:19:33.791 --> 03:19:49.456
and they all throw all their pickaxes at you. That
is 12? Misses you. First one hits soft wax. Second

03:19:49.456 --> 03:19:51.787
one is a 24.

03:19:51.787 --> 03:19:53.175
LAURA: Oh no!

03:19:53.175 --> 03:19:58.764
MATT: So you take five points of piercing damage.
Make a concentration check.

03:19:58.764 --> 03:20:03.168
LAURA: Oh, what a concentration check for the Mage
Hand? Okay!

03:20:03.168 --> 03:20:11.393
MATT: I'm pretty sure Mage Hand is concentration.
We'll find out real fast here. No, it's not

03:20:11.393 --> 03:20:13.094
concentration, it lasts for a minute.

03:20:13.094 --> 03:20:14.438
LAURA: Okay good!

03:20:14.438 --> 03:20:23.852
MATT: Just lasts for a minute. So that one you
took the damage. Third one, that's going to be a

03:20:23.852 --> 03:20:25.700
17 plus four, that's a 21.

03:20:25.700 --> 03:20:26.886
LAURA: Oh no.

03:20:26.886 --> 03:20:31.666
MATT: So you take another four plus three damage.
That's seven points of piercing damage.

03:20:31.666 --> 03:20:34.956
LAURA: I turn and look at it right as it hits me
in the face and knocks me out cold.

03:20:34.956 --> 03:20:36.440
TRAVIS: Oh it does?

03:20:36.440 --> 03:20:38.470
LAURA: (screams)

03:20:38.470 --> 03:20:43.277
MATT: You fall to the ground and the axe
(pinging). There's a little trickle of blood down

03:20:43.277 --> 03:20:45.609
your forehead as you hit the soft wax, which does
soften your blow.

03:20:45.609 --> 03:20:47.208
LAURA: Oh, it cracks my glasses.

03:20:47.208 --> 03:20:53.838
MATT: It does, one side is now shattered in a
spiderweb, as the crown clatters to the ground. As

03:20:53.838 --> 03:21:02.368
it does the glass of the lantern breaks. All
right, that's the end of the kobolds' turn. Your

03:21:02.368 --> 03:21:03.337
turn.

03:21:03.337 --> 03:21:04.840
TRAVIS: My turn?

03:21:04.840 --> 03:21:05.951
MATT: Yes.

03:21:05.951 --> 03:21:10.952
TRAVIS: Hold real still for me (whoosh). Two big
attacks with the warhammer. I'm going to dump

03:21:10.952 --> 03:21:12.935
Searing Smite into the second one.

03:21:12.935 --> 03:21:16.555
LAURA: Advantage.

03:21:16.555 --> 03:21:19.956
TRAVIS: Oh advantage, that's right. I mean they're
crits, aren't they?

03:21:19.956 --> 03:21:21.516
LAURA: Yeah.

03:21:21.516 --> 03:21:29.643
TRAVIS: So 18 to hit. 12 points of damage on the
first one.

03:21:29.643 --> 03:21:31.011
MATT: All right.

03:21:31.011 --> 03:21:33.162
LAURA: No, it's a crit. Double it.

03:21:33.162 --> 03:21:34.169
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 24.

03:21:34.169 --> 03:21:36.431
MATT: Whatever the dice was you double.

03:21:36.431 --> 03:21:41.040
TRAVIS: Yeah, oh I'm sorry, right. So 14 plus
five. 19.

03:21:41.040 --> 03:21:42.039
MATT: 19, all right.

03:21:42.039 --> 03:21:52.699
TRAVIS: 21. 21 again, and I'm dumping Searing
Smite into it. He does a constitution--

03:21:52.699 --> 03:21:53.659
LAURA: 19.

03:21:53.659 --> 03:21:55.446
TRAVIS: Yeah, sorry, what'd I say?

03:21:55.446 --> 03:21:57.347
LAURA: 19 again, you said 21.

03:21:57.347 --> 03:21:58.696
TRAVIS: Oh damn it. (laughing) Sorry.

03:21:58.696 --> 03:22:00.053
MATT: How do you want to do this?

03:22:00.053 --> 03:22:02.017
(cheering)

03:22:02.017 --> 03:22:08.841
TRAVIS: Stunned, I walk up with the warhammer,
spin it in my hand, and do one, two, with the

03:22:08.841 --> 03:22:13.880
second one arcing up with all that radiant damage.
Coming under his chin, trying to change the way

03:22:13.880 --> 03:22:15.385
his pretty face looks.

03:22:15.385 --> 03:22:20.021
MATT: And as you do, frozen in place you see the
neck muscles tensing against the magic, trying

03:22:20.021 --> 03:22:27.083
desperately to fight his way back and as the
hammer swings up, the first hit clanks across the

03:22:27.083 --> 03:22:33.143
jaw, which you see (crunch) break and go slack.
The second strike, as you hit the jaw slams

03:22:33.143 --> 03:22:38.871
upward. You see teeth shatter from the sheer force
of the impact. As the jaw slowly falls slack, both

03:22:38.871 --> 03:22:44.665
eyes are cross eyed, the forehead is pushed
inward, and he gurgles before falling onto his

03:22:44.665 --> 03:22:53.298
back, onto the ground. Unconscious. And bleeding
horribly. All right, that end your turn?

03:22:53.298 --> 03:22:54.680
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:22:54.680 --> 03:22:58.346
MATT: All right, at the end of your turn you
glance over and you notice the mage is down and

03:22:58.346 --> 03:23:07.128
you watch the shattered lantern-- suddenly flames
are beginning to emerge and swirl. You see all the

03:23:07.128 --> 03:23:11.899
nearby candle wicks that have been slowly burning
away from the heat of the room, the flames are

03:23:11.899 --> 03:23:17.784
almost being drawn from the candles towards this
lantern and this flame that is growing in the

03:23:17.784 --> 03:23:25.553
center. And you see all the kobolds are now going,
"Rakanishu, Rakanishu, Rakanishu." That ends your

03:23:25.553 --> 03:23:27.581
turn. Aerwin, you're up.

03:23:27.581 --> 03:23:33.289
JENNIFER: We need to get to safety for a minute,
and get everybody healed I think.

03:23:33.289 --> 03:23:37.728
MATT: You have two outs here, there latrine room,
and there is the crack where you were in.

03:23:37.728 --> 03:23:39.568
JENNIFER: Latrine room.

03:23:39.568 --> 03:23:41.275
MATT: You go darting for the latrine room?

03:23:41.275 --> 03:23:42.294
JENNIFER: Yep.

03:23:42.294 --> 03:23:46.896
MATT: Okay, so you double dash around, leaping
over the body of King Togwaggle, leaping off of

03:23:46.896 --> 03:23:54.110
the soft wax mound, out of the range of the
kobolds that can get a swipe at you. Dart into the

03:23:54.110 --> 03:24:03.361
open latrine room, and as you dart inside, you see
a makeshift royal restroom, complete with a

03:24:03.361 --> 03:24:09.366
terrible smell you'd expect from a kobold latrine.
There is a rickety wooden commode series, three of

03:24:09.366 --> 03:24:16.456
these nasty looking, supposed to look nice but
aren't really nice at all kobold toilets. Even

03:24:16.456 --> 03:24:21.681
dangerous to sit in, they look like they have
shards of wood and nails, jagged up. There is a

03:24:21.681 --> 03:24:25.045
rushing underground river that vanishes through a
far wall. It looks like it's set up with the bars

03:24:25.045 --> 03:24:27.365
to be almost like a bathing apparatus.

03:24:27.365 --> 03:24:33.367
JENNIFER: (sighs) Man. Rushing river, bathing
apparatus. Can I duck in there to hide?

03:24:33.367 --> 03:24:35.381
MATT: You could certainly try.

03:24:35.381 --> 03:24:37.710
JENNIFER: I'm going to duck in there and hide for
a minute to get out of danger.

03:24:37.710 --> 03:24:41.768
MATT: Okay, so you get into the water and you get
down into the rushing water. It's a pretty strong

03:24:41.768 --> 03:24:42.715
current.

03:24:42.715 --> 03:24:43.893
JENNIFER: All right.

03:24:43.893 --> 03:24:49.009
MATT: So you can hold onto one of the rails
there, that can hold you in place. Okay, so you're

03:24:49.009 --> 03:24:50.596
there, keeping low in the water.

03:24:50.596 --> 03:24:53.596
JENNIFER: Do I have any more rope left? No I used
it. I could tie myself up to rest for a minute?

03:24:53.596 --> 03:24:55.076
No, I'll just sit.

03:24:55.076 --> 03:24:57.088
LIAM: You've got six seconds, that's what your
turn is.

03:24:57.088 --> 03:25:00.472
MATT: All right, that brings us then to Quazirat.

03:25:00.472 --> 03:25:05.980
LIAM: Right I see the little one go down, so I
start hoofing it in that direction and I plant my

03:25:05.980 --> 03:25:15.050
hand right down on her little forehead and I use
Gift of the Naaru. And you get seven hit points of

03:25:15.050 --> 03:25:16.360
life.

03:25:16.360 --> 03:25:17.531
LAURA: Yay, I'm alive!

03:25:17.531 --> 03:25:19.328
LIAM: But then I keep running past her as far as I
can go.

03:25:19.328 --> 03:25:24.501
MATT: Okay. So you do that, you rush past, go to
heal her. Two of the kobolds that you struck last

03:25:24.501 --> 03:25:29.053
turn that are in melee range with you swing out
with their reactions to take an attack of

03:25:29.053 --> 03:25:30.370
opportunity.

03:25:30.370 --> 03:25:31.505
LIAM: That's fine.

03:25:31.505 --> 03:25:32.207
MATT: 20?

03:25:32.207 --> 03:25:33.323
LIAM: Sure, that hits.

03:25:33.323 --> 03:25:37.855
MATT: You take five points of piercing damage.
Other one. Oh that's a natural one. He swings

03:25:37.855 --> 03:25:43.506
wide. You rush forward, between the two other
kobolds, intending to get to her, heal her, and

03:25:43.506 --> 03:25:45.324
then continue to run. Which direction?

03:25:45.324 --> 03:25:47.109
LIAM: Towards the latrine.

03:25:47.109 --> 03:25:48.634
MATT: Okay, you go darting towards the latrine.

03:25:48.634 --> 03:25:51.090
LIAM: Which is technically fleeing, so do I need
to make saving throw with sword?

03:25:51.090 --> 03:25:52.109
MATT: You would.

03:25:52.109 --> 03:26:00.659
LIAM: Okay good. No. That's not good. That's a
four. YOLO.

03:26:00.659 --> 03:26:08.375
MATT: Adventurefury: Blessed Blade of the Thrill
Seeker calls to you. And this day, glory must be

03:26:08.375 --> 03:26:11.811
found! YOLO, motherfucker.

03:26:11.811 --> 03:26:13.314
LIAM: Bozhe moi!

03:26:13.314 --> 03:26:14.945
MATT: All righty.

03:26:14.945 --> 03:26:17.040
LIAM: But am I out of movement and I'm stuck where
I am?

03:26:17.040 --> 03:26:20.097
MATT: You've healed her and then you spin around,
blade ready, and you're going to fight these

03:26:20.097 --> 03:26:22.535
kobolds and whatever that fire thing is that's
growing.

03:26:22.535 --> 03:26:24.147
LIAM: Yes, I am.

03:26:24.147 --> 03:26:26.150
TRAVIS: Electric guitar in the background. (guitar
solo)

03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:27.991
LIAM: I take the sword. (guitar solo)

03:26:27.991 --> 03:26:36.173
MATT: All right, Greldamine. You come to
consciousness and watch as your friend spins

03:26:36.173 --> 03:26:40.725
around with his giant blade and start laughing in
this face of this-- now you notice, swelling

03:26:40.725 --> 03:26:45.631
elemental entity that is drawing fire from all of
the candles in the room and is growing by the

03:26:45.631 --> 03:26:46.760
moment.

03:26:46.760 --> 03:27:01.889
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to use Frost Nova and try
to target the fire element and the other little

03:27:01.889 --> 03:27:03.671
things that are in the room.

03:27:03.671 --> 03:27:10.463
MATT: Okay, all right. So that's a 20-foot radius.
You can hit all the kobolds. All right, so roll

03:27:10.463 --> 03:27:12.510
3d6 cold damage.

03:27:12.510 --> 03:27:18.279
LAURA: Ooh. 15.

03:27:18.279 --> 03:27:19.877
MATT: 15.

03:27:19.877 --> 03:27:21.997
TRAVIS: Constitution saving throw.

03:27:21.997 --> 03:27:27.635
MATT: Sorry about that, microphone. And they have
to make a constitution?

03:27:27.635 --> 03:27:29.021
LAURA: Constitution.

03:27:29.021 --> 03:27:36.178
MATT: For the kobolds, what is the DC on that one?
Your spell DC?

03:27:36.178 --> 03:27:40.385
LAURA: My spell DC is 16. Oh, did it go up? No.

03:27:40.385 --> 03:27:46.655
MATT: No, 16, so that's a failure on the first
one. One kobold freezes to death, locked in place

03:27:46.655 --> 03:27:55.453
as they're frozen solid. That one does succeed.
Next one fails with a one and this Rakanishu fails

03:27:55.453 --> 03:28:03.101
with a six plus-- yeah because it's constitution
he doesn't have-- it's a plus four, so that's ten.

03:28:03.101 --> 03:28:10.654
So you watch, first off, Rakanishu takes double
damage for that. Takes 30 points of cold

03:28:10.654 --> 03:28:16.572
damage being vulnerable to the cold. You watch as
the fire entity (freezing sounds). The flames

03:28:16.572 --> 03:28:20.193
slightly flicker and pull in there, and the ice
that's encased around it seems to create this orb

03:28:20.193 --> 03:28:25.042
or sphere that's holding it in place. The source
of the fire that's drawing towards it seems to be

03:28:25.042 --> 03:28:30.180
temporarily cut off and all but one kobold are all
locked by ice. One seems to break forth (growling

03:28:30.180 --> 03:28:38.533
and snorting) "My candles now!" All right, does
that end your turn or do you-- you can still

03:28:38.533 --> 03:28:39.414
move.

03:28:39.414 --> 03:28:42.140
LAURA: I'm going to move, I'm going to run towards
the latrine.

03:28:42.140 --> 03:28:45.380
MATT: Okay. Half your movement to get up from
prone because you were unconscious. So you can get

03:28:45.380 --> 03:28:50.993
about ten to 12 feet. You rush over, you're about
maybe ten feet away from it. But you're making

03:28:50.993 --> 03:28:52.328
your way as best you can!

03:28:52.328 --> 03:28:53.509
LAURA: Are there any candles around?

03:28:53.509 --> 03:28:55.092
MATT: There are dozens of candles.

03:28:55.092 --> 03:28:55.509
LAURA: Still?

03:28:55.509 --> 03:28:58.452
MATT: Yeah, I mean they seem softer and you can
see clusters of them, but yeah.

03:28:58.452 --> 03:28:59.605
LAURA: Okay.

03:28:59.605 --> 03:29:03.024
MATT: All right, that ends your turn? That brings
us to Bundle.

03:29:03.024 --> 03:29:07.859
TALIESIN: I'm going to Channel Divinity and
quickly throw seven points of healing at

03:29:07.859 --> 03:29:21.384
everybody, and myself. Every little bit helps. I'm
going to, just for fun, take a swing with the

03:29:21.384 --> 03:29:26.785
mousetrap at the giant flame beast to see what
happens.

03:29:26.785 --> 03:29:30.308
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll an attack on that.

03:29:30.308 --> 03:29:33.926
TALIESIN: That's a 14?

03:29:33.926 --> 03:29:37.661
MATT: 14? Unfortunately, as it goes to snap, it
hits the ice that's encased around it and can't

03:29:37.661 --> 03:29:39.441
seem to break past. No effect.

03:29:39.441 --> 03:29:44.224
TALIESIN: I'm going to turn and run to the
latrine. &lt;i&gt;Aye!&lt;/i&gt; Then I'm going to turn around and

03:29:44.224 --> 03:29:45.368
run.

03:29:45.368 --> 03:29:48.252
MATT: Okay. So you go and run. You can get into
the doorway of the latrine to avoid the kobolds

03:29:48.252 --> 03:29:51.870
that are still in place from getting an attack of
opportunity. All right cool, so you get there,

03:29:51.870 --> 03:29:55.724
that's the end of your turn. The kobolds now are
there, only one of them can move. He's going to go

03:29:55.724 --> 03:29:59.895
ahead and charge after you, who got back up and
swing at you. It's going to rush up to you, and

03:29:59.895 --> 03:30:01.474
swing with its pickaxe.

03:30:01.474 --> 03:30:10.410
That's going to be a 17 plus four. That's
going to be a 21. You take five points of piercing

03:30:10.410 --> 03:30:12.967
damage. Are you still up?

03:30:12.967 --> 03:30:13.880
LAURA: Yeah.

03:30:13.880 --> 03:30:20.359
MATT: The other two are going to begin throwing
their pickaxes. They have a whole cluster of them

03:30:20.359 --> 03:30:23.795
in their bag, and they're throwing them as best as
they can. One of them's going throw at you, and

03:30:23.795 --> 03:30:34.695
then one more, because one of them died, is going
to throw at you. So against you, that's going to

03:30:34.695 --> 03:30:36.031
be a 14.

03:30:36.031 --> 03:30:37.388
TRAVIS: Misses! Sorry.

03:30:37.388 --> 03:30:43.740
MATT: Against you, that's going to be a 12. You
guys are deflecting the pickaxes in the middle of

03:30:43.740 --> 03:30:47.705
the air. Ending their turn, it is now Rakanishu's
turn.

03:30:47.705 --> 03:30:51.422
LAURA: At least he can't move, you guys.

03:30:51.422 --> 03:31:00.813
MATT: All right, so. Beginning of the round, the
ice breaks. His movement's still zero, so

03:31:00.813 --> 03:31:03.862
Rakanishu cannot move, but you're watching as he
begins to gather the flames again from the nearby

03:31:03.862 --> 03:31:11.042
candles. This is a burning fire elemental entity
made of pure rage and flame, and this flickering

03:31:11.042 --> 03:31:24.170
voice goes, "Free! That foolish kobold knew not
what he had. I will be the new firelord!" And his

03:31:24.170 --> 03:31:29.336
mouth opens, and you watch as all the flames begin
to pull out. All of the candles in the room are

03:31:29.336 --> 03:31:36.723
snuffed as the flames are consumed, and the
elemental begins to grow bigger and bigger. As it

03:31:36.723 --> 03:31:44.996
does so, everyone who's still in the room-- which
is you, you, and you're at the door, and you-- all

03:31:44.996 --> 03:31:48.604
suffer one point of fire damage.

03:31:48.604 --> 03:32:00.814
And then as part of his attack, he's going to use
his explode. (roars) And detonates in the chamber,

03:32:00.814 --> 03:32:05.141
40-foot radius, so that's all of you.

03:32:05.141 --> 03:32:05.945
LIAM: Is that a dex save?

03:32:05.945 --> 03:32:13.757
MATT: Nope. All of you ignite. No immediate
damage, but you're all on fire. At the top of your

03:32:13.757 --> 03:32:18.562
round, you take 1d6 fire damage until you take an
action or something to put the fire out. All

03:32:18.562 --> 03:32:22.795
right, so that's the end of Rakanishu's turn. It's
your turn.

03:32:22.795 --> 03:32:26.238
TRAVIS: (pained noises) I run forward.

03:32:26.238 --> 03:32:29.555
MATT: Top of your turn, you take six points of
fire damage.

03:32:29.555 --> 03:32:41.434
TRAVIS: I run forward with two attacks from my
warhammer against Rakanishu. That is 16?

03:32:41.434 --> 03:32:46.450
MATT: Misses. You swing, and the flames seem to
dodge out of it. You hit air, as it seems to be

03:32:46.450 --> 03:32:51.183
reforming its body to avoid the blows and then
going back into its semi-solid fire form.

03:32:51.183 --> 03:32:52.709
TRAVIS: 23?

03:32:52.709 --> 03:32:53.507
MATT: 23 hits.

03:32:53.507 --> 03:33:11.071
TRAVIS: Ten and I will use my bonus action to dump
Searing Smite into this one. So that's an extra

03:33:11.071 --> 03:33:18.380
five points of what kind of damage? I'm not sure.
I think it's fire.

03:33:18.380 --> 03:33:23.458
MATT: Searing Smite? Yeah, that's fire damage.
That does nothing against a fire elemental.

03:33:23.458 --> 03:33:25.030
TRAVIS: That was so smart!

03:33:25.030 --> 03:33:31.842
MATT: So as the flames consume your hammer and it
hits, it devours the fire from the hammer.

03:33:31.842 --> 03:33:35.013
TRAVIS: Well, cool. Good deal. All right, next!

03:33:35.013 --> 03:33:41.186
MATT: (laughter) You still do weapon damage on top
of it, so roll that.

03:33:41.186 --> 03:33:42.963
TRAVIS: It was ten points.

03:33:42.963 --> 03:33:48.854
MATT: All right. Ten damage there. That ends your
turn. That brings us to you, Aerwin.

03:33:48.854 --> 03:33:53.044
JENNIFER: I'm going to go after it with the
kingslayer. Try to take it out.

03:33:53.044 --> 03:33:56.843
MATT: At the top of your round, because you're on
fire-- technically, you were low in the water.

03:33:56.843 --> 03:34:01.554
Because you were low in the water, the flames,
when they begin to take form on you and begin to

03:34:01.554 --> 03:34:06.430
engulf, you duck low and you would have probably
been unaffected. Water puts out the flames. All

03:34:06.430 --> 03:34:10.980
right, so you let go of the pole, you rush back
into the chamber. You cannot get quite close

03:34:10.980 --> 03:34:15.282
enough to hit him with a melee. You could throw
the dagger, if you want to, or shoot it.

03:34:15.282 --> 03:34:19.505
JENNIFER: Oh, with the crossbow? Yes, I'm going to
do the crossbow.

03:34:19.505 --> 03:34:24.473
MATT: Okay, so bolt in. Release it. Fire with the
crossbow.

03:34:24.473 --> 03:34:26.689
LIAM: Is Lohkor adjacent?

03:34:26.689 --> 03:34:28.599
MATT: He is, yes, so you get sneak attack.

03:34:28.599 --> 03:34:32.271
JENNIFER: I'm going to add, because it's the
dagger--

03:34:32.271 --> 03:34:35.030
LIAM: No, you're doing the crossbow, you said. You
can do the dagger.

03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:37.061
JENNIFER: It's the dagger in the crossbow.

03:34:37.061 --> 03:34:41.723
LIAM: You cannot fire it. You can throw the
dagger, or you can fire the crossbow.

03:34:41.723 --> 03:34:47.444
JENNIFER: Throwing the dagger, so 30.

03:34:47.444 --> 03:34:49.229
MATT: 30? That'll hit. Roll damage.

03:34:49.229 --> 03:34:58.443
LIAM: So 1d4. Roll the pyramid, then roll your
four cubes. Add that all up.

03:34:58.443 --> 03:35:07.607
JENNIFER: Eight, 11, 13. 16. Plus poison.

03:35:07.607 --> 03:35:14.894
MATT: No poison damage. The elemental is immune to
poison, unfortunately. It's made of fire; there

03:35:14.894 --> 03:35:20.048
are no veins for the poison to affect. The dagger
slams into the fiery torso, and you see a moment

03:35:20.048 --> 03:35:25.291
of resistance as the blade carves into the flames,
then falls and clatters to the ground below it. It

03:35:25.291 --> 03:35:30.652
seems like it did some damage. But it doesn't seem
to be reacting to the impact.

03:35:30.652 --> 03:35:38.039
JENNIFER: So now, I daggered him. Can I shortsword
him?

03:35:38.039 --> 03:35:40.234
LIAM: No, you can't do another attack. You can use
a bonus action--

03:35:40.234 --> 03:35:41.806
JENNIFER: I'm going to back up.

03:35:41.806 --> 03:35:46.150
MATT: You can dash back into the water, if you
want to. So you go back to the water. Holding on

03:35:46.150 --> 03:35:50.899
there; the water's rushing below you. You can see
the water as it's rushing in, it's disappearing

03:35:50.899 --> 03:35:56.056
into a small opening where the rest of the river
is disappearing towards. That ends your turn. That

03:35:56.056 --> 03:35:57.414
brings us to Bundle.

03:35:57.414 --> 03:36:04.667
TALIESIN: First thing I'm going to do is attack
with the Spiritual Weapon, as my bonus action, so

03:36:04.667 --> 03:36:09.874
that's-- oh, that probably hit. 23.

03:36:09.874 --> 03:36:16.637
MATT: Wait, no. I got the order wrong. Quazirat.
Hold onto that roll.

03:36:16.637 --> 03:36:26.104
LIAM: Okay, so I'm on fire? Fuck it. I run, and I
attack. I shout: For Argus! And I run forward to

03:36:26.104 --> 03:36:31.139
him, and I would like to attack-attack for my
attack, but then also use my recovered action

03:36:31.139 --> 03:36:43.428
surge, so I'll hit this fucker three times. First
one is good. Don't distract me! Is 29.

03:36:43.428 --> 03:36:47.207
MATT: That hits. You take four points of fire
damage.

03:36:47.207 --> 03:36:49.426
LIAM: Fine. Is 17 for the next?

03:36:49.426 --> 03:36:51.066
MATT: That misses.

03:36:51.066 --> 03:36:55.251
LIAM: Okay. And last one-- oh, balls-- is 20.

03:36:55.251 --> 03:37:01.825
MATT: 20 hits, and you suffer ten fire damage from
hitting him. You now see at the size that it's

03:37:01.825 --> 03:37:06.597
gotten, hitting it with a melee attack does fire
damage to you by proximity.

03:37:06.597 --> 03:37:14.361
LIAM: That's good shit, so here we go. First
attack-- oh, that's terrible!-- for ten? Second

03:37:14.361 --> 03:37:20.897
attack that hits is 18, so a total of 28, all
told.

03:37:20.897 --> 03:37:25.316
MATT: 28, all told. Gotcha. Okay, so as you're
slamming into it, the flames are burning your

03:37:25.316 --> 03:37:30.888
skin, and you're wincing, swinging as hard as you
can, a few make purchase into its body, and you

03:37:30.888 --> 03:37:35.880
can see it carving away. It reacts a bit from the
hits, but the giant jack-o-lantern fire grin

03:37:35.880 --> 03:37:38.438
continues to swell and grow with its physical
size.

03:37:38.438 --> 03:37:40.851
LIAM: It's all right. I hold my ground and block
my friends.

03:37:40.851 --> 03:37:47.272
MATT: Okay, ending that, now it comes to top of
the round. Your turn.

03:37:47.272 --> 03:37:48.827
LAURA: Are there any more kobolds alive?

03:37:48.827 --> 03:37:58.878
MATT: There are three of them. Actually, yes.
There are three of them, but they're on fire. It

03:37:58.878 --> 03:38:04.542
didn't distinguish. Everything caught fire in the
room, and there are three kobolds going, (pained

03:38:04.542 --> 03:38:08.927
noises) as they're burning up. Rakanishu don't
give a shit.

03:38:08.927 --> 03:38:22.994
LAURA: Okay, well, I'm going to cast Sleep at
2nd-level, so that gives me 7d8 worth of hit dice

03:38:22.994 --> 03:38:24.182
to knock people out.

03:38:24.182 --> 03:38:25.519
MATT: Okay, roll that.

03:38:25.519 --> 03:38:29.140
TRAVIS: Whoa. Sleep.

03:38:29.140 --> 03:38:43.754
LAURA: I'm thinking they're d6, but they're not.
(counting)

03:38:43.754 --> 03:38:48.495
LIAM: Don't act surprised, Travis. We know you're
going to be a Sleep magician in the next

03:38:48.495 --> 03:38:49.833
campaign.

03:38:49.833 --> 03:38:51.995
LAURA: 34.

03:38:51.995 --> 03:39:03.630
MATT: 34? Okay. You watch as the three screaming
kobolds (screaming, snoring). Smoldering as they

03:39:03.630 --> 03:39:07.813
sleep on the ground. On fire. Really tired.

03:39:07.813 --> 03:39:12.641
LAURA: For my movement, I'm going to run towards
the latrine.

03:39:12.641 --> 03:39:14.277
MATT: You're still on fire, right?

03:39:14.277 --> 03:39:15.458
LAURA: Yeah, and jump in the water.

03:39:15.458 --> 03:39:17.290
MATT: You took four fire damage at the top of the
round.

03:39:17.290 --> 03:39:20.044
LAURA: Okay, and I'm going to jump in the water to
put myself out.

03:39:20.044 --> 03:39:22.616
MATT: The flames go out as you dive into the
water.

03:39:22.616 --> 03:39:26.362
LIAM: They look so innocent when they're asleep
and on fire.

03:39:26.362 --> 03:39:30.354
MATT: Bundle, now it's your turn. Sorry. You can
still take that attack if you want to.

03:39:30.354 --> 03:39:33.138
TALIESIN: 23 with the Spiritual Weapon to hit.

03:39:33.138 --> 03:39:37.565
MATT: Top of the turn, you still take six points
of fire damage, as you're burning.

03:39:37.565 --> 03:39:47.847
TALIESIN: All right, that's fine. Let's hit this
thing with the mousetrap again. Plus my spell

03:39:47.847 --> 03:39:50.320
attack bonus, so it's 16 points of damage.

03:39:50.320 --> 03:39:56.130
MATT: 16 points of damage. As the giant divine
trap snaps on, you watch as it snaps through one

03:39:56.130 --> 03:40:01.329
of the arms. The fire arm vanishes, as it seems to
sever it at the shoulder, then it reforms

03:40:01.329 --> 03:40:02.912
afterward.

03:40:02.912 --> 03:40:14.006
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to use my second Channel
Divinity: Preserve Life and put 30 points of

03:40:14.006 --> 03:40:21.279
health into you to keep you awake, and I'm going
to take five for myself, then I'm going to run

03:40:21.279 --> 03:40:23.054
into the latrine, as well.

03:40:23.054 --> 03:40:27.705
MATT: Okay, so you dart into the latrine. You go
into the water. You manage to put the flames out

03:40:27.705 --> 03:40:31.098
on you, and now you have three of you sitting in
there. There's enough room for maybe four of you

03:40:31.098 --> 03:40:36.593
into this rushing-water area. All right, so you've
mostly clustered there. That ends your turn. The

03:40:36.593 --> 03:40:47.005
kobolds that are sleeping, it's their turn.
(laughs) They all quietly expire as they smolder

03:40:47.005 --> 03:40:48.535
in their sleep.

03:40:48.535 --> 03:40:52.981
TALIESIN: Live by the candle, die by the candle.

03:40:52.981 --> 03:41:02.890
MATT: And they are. They are their own candle.
Okay, so that finishes their turn. There are no

03:41:02.890 --> 03:41:08.545
more kobolds in this chamber. Rakanishu is now
going to--

03:41:08.545 --> 03:41:11.684
LIAM: I'm in his grill.

03:41:11.684 --> 03:41:21.317
MATT: Both of you are. He's going to focus on you.
He's going to take two fire rakes at you. That is

03:41:21.317 --> 03:41:24.105
26 to hit and 25 to hit.

03:41:24.105 --> 03:41:26.108
LIAM: That almost doesn't hit, but it does.

03:41:26.108 --> 03:41:31.838
MATT: You take 18 points of fire damage from the
first hit.

03:41:31.838 --> 03:41:33.182
LIAM: Totally cool.

03:41:33.182 --> 03:41:36.705
MATT: That's 21 points of fire damage from the
second hit.

03:41:36.705 --> 03:41:51.457
LIAM: So 18 and 21? Cool. Let's find out what that
does. I'm not down, but-- okay, cool. I'm up.

03:41:51.457 --> 03:41:58.898
MATT: Actually, technically? Sorry, those should
be an additional d6, because every round that he

03:41:58.898 --> 03:42:04.709
consumes fire, he increases the damage he deals,
so an additional seven points of fire damage. All

03:42:04.709 --> 03:42:09.130
right, cool. That brings us to the end of
Rakanishu's turn, who is going to begin shifting,

03:42:09.130 --> 03:42:13.856
using the movement, which gives you guys both an
attack of opportunity. Is now moving towards the

03:42:13.856 --> 03:42:17.362
latrine, where everyone's rushing towards. Both of
you guys get attacks of opportunity.

03:42:17.362 --> 03:42:22.261
LIAM: 15.

03:42:22.261 --> 03:42:24.299
TRAVIS: Jesus! Nope.

03:42:24.299 --> 03:42:28.040
MATT: Both of you guys-- he's too fast, and both
of you swing your weapons and actually hit in the

03:42:28.040 --> 03:42:35.518
middle of the air, and there's a spark, and you
both "Damn it!" at each other. Up to the top. That

03:42:35.518 --> 03:42:41.440
brings us to Lohkor. Your turn.

03:42:41.440 --> 03:42:42.882
LAURA: Lohkor.

03:42:42.882 --> 03:42:45.272
TRAVIS: Oh, me! I run up behind and I hit it!

03:42:45.272 --> 03:42:47.159
MATT: Go for it.

03:42:47.159 --> 03:42:50.511
TRAVIS: 20!

03:42:50.511 --> 03:42:53.421
MATT: Hits. You take three points of fire damage.

03:42:53.421 --> 03:43:08.192
TRAVIS: Yay. I rolled the wrong thing. Six points
of damage. Second one. 16.

03:43:08.192 --> 03:43:10.919
MATT: 16 misses. It goes wide.

03:43:10.919 --> 03:43:14.359
TRAVIS: There you go. Cool. That's it.

03:43:14.359 --> 03:43:18.549
MATT: All right, so you rush up and you're behind,
swinging. One hits, one misses. The heat is

03:43:18.549 --> 03:43:22.960
intense now, and whatever facial hair you had is
now gone. Your hairline is beginning to burn away.

03:43:22.960 --> 03:43:27.781
The hairs on your head are being singed off by
being this close to the beast. All right, that's

03:43:27.781 --> 03:43:30.713
going to bring us to Aerwin, your turn.

03:43:30.713 --> 03:43:33.019
JENNIFER: I need to get my dagger back. I'm going
to get my dagger back.

03:43:33.019 --> 03:43:36.372
LIAM: Oh, you're picking it up instead of
attacking? That's your call.

03:43:36.372 --> 03:43:40.923
JENNIFER: No, I want to attack. I want to attack!
I'm going to use the crossbow, because that's what

03:43:40.923 --> 03:43:42.203
I have.

03:43:42.203 --> 03:43:43.392
MATT: All right, roll for an attack.

03:43:43.392 --> 03:43:48.022
LIAM: Plus, what is it, seven?

03:43:48.022 --> 03:43:50.442
JENNIFER: Seven. 15.

03:43:50.442 --> 03:43:54.883
MATT: 15? You go to strike, and it barely misses
it by a couple of inches and fires off into the

03:43:54.883 --> 03:43:56.460
distant room, unfortunately.

03:43:56.460 --> 03:43:59.777
JENNIFER: He's coming toward the latrine?

03:43:59.777 --> 03:44:01.232
MATT: He's coming in that direction, yeah.

03:44:01.232 --> 03:44:03.817
JENNIFER: I'm going to go around him to the other
side to prepare to come after him again.

03:44:03.817 --> 03:44:05.942
MATT: Still inside the latrine?

03:44:05.942 --> 03:44:09.735
JENNIFER: I'm not in the latrine. I came out of
the latrine to attack him.

03:44:09.735 --> 03:44:11.507
MATT: I thought you backed back into it, into the
water.

03:44:11.507 --> 03:44:15.119
JENNIFER: End of the last turn, I went back in,
right?

03:44:15.119 --> 03:44:16.829
MATT: You threw it, then went back in.

03:44:16.829 --> 03:44:20.095
JENNIFER: I didn't have to come out to crossbow
him, did I?

03:44:20.095 --> 03:44:21.263
MATT: Not necessarily.

03:44:21.263 --> 03:44:24.747
JENNIFER: I came out to crossbow him, and then can
I run across the chamber?

03:44:24.747 --> 03:44:29.218
MATT: Sure, I'll let you do that. As you move past
him, he does get an attack of opportunity on you.

03:44:29.218 --> 03:44:40.056
That's going to be a 23 to hit. That is 15 points
of fire damage to you as you run past.

03:44:40.056 --> 03:44:44.415
LAURA: Oh no, unconscious?

03:44:44.415 --> 03:44:46.484
LIAM: No, she's up.

03:44:46.484 --> 03:44:49.836
MATT: That ends your turn. Quazirat, you're up.

03:44:49.836 --> 03:44:57.350
LIAM: I think of my father, Leeron Jenkins, and I
run.

03:44:57.350 --> 03:45:01.316
MATT: I like Leeron Jenkins. Offshoot bloodline.

03:45:01.316 --> 03:45:10.443
LIAM: I run at him, and I attack again. Yeah,
okay. First attack is okay. It's 22.

03:45:10.443 --> 03:45:11.842
MATT: That hits.

03:45:11.842 --> 03:45:16.656
LIAM: Second attack is a 21.

03:45:16.656 --> 03:45:17.618
MATT: Both hit.

03:45:17.618 --> 03:45:25.961
LIAM: Okay, first time, we get 18. Next one, 16.

03:45:25.961 --> 03:45:31.663
MATT: Okay, 18 and 16. All right. You also suffer
nine points of fire damage from the two strikes,

03:45:31.663 --> 03:45:34.867
the flames beating into your face each time you
hit him.

03:45:34.867 --> 03:45:36.615
LIAM: That is so cool.

03:45:36.615 --> 03:45:40.260
MATT: All right, is that the end of your turn?

03:45:40.260 --> 03:45:43.449
LIAM: Yes, it is. Still up.

03:45:43.449 --> 03:45:50.911
MATT: Nice. Yeah, it looks like it's taken a
beating, but it's not looking super rough.

03:45:50.911 --> 03:45:53.541
LIAM: Next round, for sure.

03:45:53.541 --> 03:45:56.354
MATT: Now, your turn. Greldamine.

03:45:56.354 --> 03:45:59.201
LAURA: With my magic wand of missiles--

03:45:59.201 --> 03:46:04.002
LIAM: Sorry! I have a bonus action. I'm going to
use my Second Wind. Thank you. Go.

03:46:04.002 --> 03:46:05.395
MATT: How many times can you use Second Wind?

03:46:05.395 --> 03:46:09.375
LIAM: I recovered it. I used it once before, we
took a short rest, and this is the last time.

03:46:09.375 --> 03:46:12.775
LAURA: With my magic wand of missiles, can I use
all my charges?

03:46:12.775 --> 03:46:14.291
MATT: Sure.

03:46:14.291 --> 03:46:24.656
LAURA: I'm going to use all seven charges in the
magic wand of missiles, and I'm going to try to

03:46:24.656 --> 03:46:25.788
hit it.

03:46:25.788 --> 03:46:30.074
MATT: All right, so that would technically be a
7th-level Magic Missile, which means you'd shoot

03:46:30.074 --> 03:46:34.250
nine darts, so 9d4 plus nine.

03:46:34.250 --> 03:46:36.767
TRAVIS: 9d4?

03:46:36.767 --> 03:46:56.459
LAURA: (counting) 20.

03:46:56.459 --> 03:46:57.808
TRAVIS: Uno mas.

03:46:57.808 --> 03:47:01.436
LAURA: One more? 21 plus--

03:47:01.436 --> 03:47:01.936
MATT: Nine.

03:47:01.936 --> 03:47:03.398
LAURA: Plus nine?

03:47:03.398 --> 03:47:10.128
MATT: 30 points of force damage. As you hold the
wand out in front of you, full-on anime missile

03:47:10.128 --> 03:47:18.326
style, nine magic arcane missiles slam into
Rakanishu. As the impacts hit, Aluneth, in the

03:47:18.326 --> 03:47:25.276
back of your mind, goes, "Yes, that's what I'm
talking about!" Awesome. And you're going to stay

03:47:25.276 --> 03:47:26.470
in the water?

03:47:26.470 --> 03:47:27.442
LAURA: Heck yeah!

03:47:27.442 --> 03:47:30.444
MATT: All right. That's going to end your turn.
Bundle, you're up.

03:47:30.444 --> 03:47:33.918
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Spirit Guardians at
level three.

03:47:33.918 --> 03:47:36.260
MATT: Spirit Guardians is still up, isn't it,
though?

03:47:36.260 --> 03:47:40.570
TALIESIN: Spirit Guardians is different. You're
thinking of Spiritual Weapon. This is Spirit

03:47:40.570 --> 03:47:46.931
Guardians, so if he's within 15 feet of me, that's
going to be a thing on his turn, if he's within 15

03:47:46.931 --> 03:47:53.018
feet. Also, he's slowed by half. But I'm also
going to hit him with my Spiritual Weapon.

03:47:53.018 --> 03:48:00.195
Mousetrap! Goddamn it. I miss. Can I have my die
back?

03:48:00.195 --> 03:48:06.337
MATT: Nope. It's mine now. All right, that ends
your turn. It is now Rakanishu's turn. The flames

03:48:06.337 --> 03:48:15.327
continue to swell even larger, and now there is a
flaming radius. Fire is now around him. You see

03:48:15.327 --> 03:48:21.048
all the wax around him is beginning to burn and
bubble in the immediate vicinity. He's going to

03:48:21.048 --> 03:48:29.260
make two fire rake attacks: one against you, and
one against you. Against you, that is an 18.

03:48:29.260 --> 03:48:31.032
LIAM: Oh, I'm an 18 AC.

03:48:31.032 --> 03:48:38.694
MATT: That hits you, just barely. And against you,
that is a 16.

03:48:38.694 --> 03:48:40.120
TRAVIS: That misses.

03:48:40.120 --> 03:48:49.351
MATT: All right, it misses you. You, however,
suffer 19 points of fire damage.

03:48:49.351 --> 03:48:51.118
LIAM: Do svidaniya.

03:48:51.118 --> 03:48:52.680
(groaning)

03:48:52.680 --> 03:48:58.036
MATT: (impact) Falls to the ground, burning in
cinders. Still conscious, but hurting.

03:48:58.036 --> 03:49:00.398
LIAM: Still conscious?

03:49:00.398 --> 03:49:02.959
MATT: Not conscious, sorry. Still &lt;i&gt;alive&lt;/i&gt;.

03:49:02.959 --> 03:49:04.304
LIAM: Still alive.

03:49:04.304 --> 03:49:13.244
MATT: All right, and with that, you watch as
Rakanishu begins to move into the chamber, and the

03:49:13.244 --> 03:49:21.265
presence begins to light the commodes on fire. The
wood's beginning to burn. The entire area is now

03:49:21.265 --> 03:49:22.531
in flames.

03:49:22.531 --> 03:49:25.929
LIAM: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Pots.

03:49:25.929 --> 03:49:28.484
MATT: You do get an attack of opportunity as he
moves away from you.

03:49:28.484 --> 03:49:31.514
TRAVIS: That's a 24.

03:49:31.514 --> 03:49:34.353
MATT: That hits. You suffer five points of fire
damage.

03:49:34.353 --> 03:49:45.150
TRAVIS: That's nine points of bludgeoning damage,
and I'll put some Branding Smite into it, as well,

03:49:45.150 --> 03:49:48.490
as a bonus action. Do I get a bonus action as a
reaction?

03:49:48.490 --> 03:49:52.940
MATT: On a reaction, you don't, so you can't do
that. Nine points of bludgeoning. All right--

03:49:52.940 --> 03:49:58.938
TALIESIN: Is he within 15 feet of me now? He has
to do a wisdom saving throw.

03:49:58.938 --> 03:50:00.845
MATT: Okay. Natural 20.

03:50:00.845 --> 03:50:02.556
(groaning)

03:50:02.556 --> 03:50:05.323
MATT: Still takes damage, but it's halved, I
believe.

03:50:05.323 --> 03:50:11.608
TALIESIN: That's 3d8. 12, so six points of radiant
damage.

03:50:11.608 --> 03:50:15.068
MATT: Six points of radiant damage onto Rakanishu.
All right, end of the turn, top of your turn,

03:50:15.068 --> 03:50:22.386
Lohkor, you suffer three points of fire damage
from the proximity of the fire aura. All right,

03:50:22.386 --> 03:50:24.041
your turn.

03:50:24.041 --> 03:50:31.715
TRAVIS: My turn. Two attacks against him. That's a
23, should hit, and the second one is-- no, that's

03:50:31.715 --> 03:50:33.136
not a hit.

03:50:33.136 --> 03:50:35.531
MATT: Okay, so four points of fire damage from the
first hit.

03:50:35.531 --> 03:50:47.101
TRAVIS: Nine points of bludgeoning damage, and as
a bonus action, I'm going to put Branding Smite

03:50:47.101 --> 03:50:54.017
into it, which is 2d6 radiant damage, and the
enemy glows bright.

03:50:54.017 --> 03:50:56.828
MATT: I think he's pretty bright as it is.

03:50:56.828 --> 03:50:58.565
TRAVIS: Four points of radiant damage.

03:50:58.565 --> 03:51:03.720
MATT: All righty, got it. That ends your turn? All
right, so you rush up to him. All of you are

03:51:03.720 --> 03:51:08.803
clustered in the commode, which is now in flames
all around. Aerwin, your turn.

03:51:08.803 --> 03:51:10.580
JENNIFER: I'm going to shoot him with the
crossbow--

03:51:10.580 --> 03:51:14.260
MATT: You're now on the other side of the chamber,
crossbow out. Go for it.

03:51:14.260 --> 03:51:20.333
JENNIFER: 18. 26.

03:51:20.333 --> 03:51:21.828
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

03:51:21.828 --> 03:51:23.389
LIAM: Is Lohkor adjacent? Okay.

03:51:23.389 --> 03:51:25.111
JENNIFER: 1d6?

03:51:25.111 --> 03:51:31.305
LIAM: Yeah, you hit, so a cube, plus sneak attack
damage. Four, plus these guys.

03:51:31.305 --> 03:51:39.126
JENNIFER: 16. 21.

03:51:39.126 --> 03:51:48.918
MATT: 21 points of damage. Okay, so it sticks in
the back, and you watch the flames, while growing,

03:51:48.918 --> 03:51:54.730
it's starting to grow thin. The flames are growing
more disparate, and the connectivity of all this

03:51:54.730 --> 03:51:59.325
fire is beginning to look like the mass is
lessening. The damage is starting to take a toll

03:51:59.325 --> 03:52:02.511
on it. Are you going to stay where you are?

03:52:02.511 --> 03:52:05.373
JENNIFER: I'll back up.

03:52:05.373 --> 03:52:09.985
MATT: So you're even further away on the opposite
side? Gotcha. All right, cool. That brings us to--

03:52:09.985 --> 03:52:12.544
make a death saving throw.

03:52:12.544 --> 03:52:15.358
LIAM: Yo. I'm good.

03:52:15.358 --> 03:52:19.345
MATT: All right. Greldemeyer, you're up.

03:52:19.345 --> 03:52:20.924
LAURA: Greldamine.

03:52:20.924 --> 03:52:22.051
MATT: Greldamine, sorry.

03:52:22.051 --> 03:52:24.130
LAURA: It's fine. It's a hard name.

03:52:24.130 --> 03:52:25.639
TRAVIS: Grundlemeyer.

03:52:25.639 --> 03:52:26.518
MATT: Gwendelmere.

03:52:26.518 --> 03:52:37.699
LAURA: I'm going to cast-- Grandlefarts!-- Sleep
again, at 2nd-level.

03:52:37.699 --> 03:52:39.735
MATT: All right, go for it. Roll the dice.

03:52:39.735 --> 03:52:41.702
LIAM: On the thing?

03:52:41.702 --> 03:52:44.928
LAURA: Yeah. That's how many? 7d8?

03:52:44.928 --> 03:52:46.751
MATT: 7d8.

03:52:46.751 --> 03:53:08.967
LAURA: (counting) 25.

03:53:08.967 --> 03:53:18.539
MATT: You watch as the flame begins to flicker a
bit, then die down to this tiniest little candle

03:53:18.539 --> 03:53:24.890
flicker on the ground. And there, you see this
tiny flame that's wavering lazily. Room is still

03:53:24.890 --> 03:53:29.912
on fire, and everything around it is awful, but
apparently, it was at a point where the Sleep

03:53:29.912 --> 03:53:31.164
could take effect.

03:53:31.164 --> 03:53:36.279
LAURA: Oh my gosh! You guys, grab as many candles
as you can, and let's get the hell out of here!

03:53:36.279 --> 03:53:38.014
TRAVIS: Snuff that flame?

03:53:38.014 --> 03:53:42.100
LAURA: I don't know! If you damage it, it wakes
back up. I'm not exactly sure how this thing

03:53:42.100 --> 03:53:43.234
works.

03:53:43.234 --> 03:53:53.622
JENNIFER: I have a waterskin. If it's that size
and sleeping, would that much water take it out?

03:53:53.622 --> 03:53:58.879
LAURA: Let's grab all the candles we can. They
might all be completely melted.

03:53:58.879 --> 03:54:00.324
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:54:00.324 --> 03:54:02.126
LIAM: About 20 seconds have passed. Should I make
another death save?

03:54:02.126 --> 03:54:03.471
MATT: Yes, you should.

03:54:03.471 --> 03:54:09.522
LAURA: Can somebody else please make an
investigation check? We're searching for candles.

03:54:09.522 --> 03:54:11.262
TRAVIS: 16.

03:54:11.262 --> 03:54:12.714
TALIESIN: Take 2d4 plus two.

03:54:12.714 --> 03:54:19.190
MATT: You manage to find an armful of soft
candles. They're pushed together and mush now.

03:54:19.190 --> 03:54:22.874
LAURA: Is there a bag I can shove some wax into?

03:54:22.874 --> 03:54:28.188
MATT: You've got sacks. You quickly start filling
sacks. How long does the spell last for Sleep?

03:54:28.188 --> 03:54:31.104
LAURA: It doesn't say. Oh, a minute.

03:54:31.104 --> 03:54:34.149
MATT: Okay. You've got to hurry.

03:54:34.149 --> 03:54:35.804
LAURA: Really quickly!

03:54:35.804 --> 03:54:37.318
LIAM: What happened?

03:54:37.318 --> 03:54:38.604
TALIESIN: Good things. We're running!

03:54:38.604 --> 03:54:39.745
LIAM: Did I get him?

03:54:39.745 --> 03:54:40.721
TALIESIN: Yes. We're running.

03:54:40.721 --> 03:54:41.485
LIAM: What are we doing?

03:54:41.485 --> 03:54:44.174
LAURA: Right as we're running out, pour the water
on him, and we'll jump in the latrine.

03:54:44.174 --> 03:54:46.740
JENNIFER: Got it. It's done!

03:54:46.740 --> 03:54:50.339
MATT: So you guys all rush into the latrine room,
and what are you doing?

03:54:50.339 --> 03:54:54.859
JENNIFER: I have the waterskin. I'm going to pour
some water on this tiny flame and try to kill it.

03:54:54.859 --> 03:54:59.183
MATT: All right, so you uncork it and pour the
water onto the flame. You watch the flame

03:54:59.183 --> 03:55:06.911
(whoosh). It restores into the full Rakanishu
elemental. The room immediately, all the flames

03:55:06.911 --> 03:55:09.899
brighten once more. What are you guys doing?

03:55:09.899 --> 03:55:11.268
LAURA: Jumping into the latrine!

03:55:11.268 --> 03:55:15.231
TRAVIS: Yeah, jump into the latrine, and maybe let
the raging current take us wherever.

03:55:15.231 --> 03:55:16.529
JENNIFER: It goes somewhere.

03:55:16.529 --> 03:55:21.838
MATT: The rushing river, you mean? Okay.

03:55:21.838 --> 03:55:29.304
LIAM: Right, so we make a run, and I make a wisdom
save, and I fail, so I turn around and go back. I

03:55:29.304 --> 03:55:30.500
drop my candles.

03:55:30.500 --> 03:55:34.598
MATT: All of you guys dive into the water, letting
the water take you like a water slide, one after

03:55:34.598 --> 03:55:43.538
the other, and you watch as Quazirat turns around
with Adventurefury, the Blessed Blade of the

03:55:43.538 --> 03:55:51.821
Thrill-Seeker in his hand, and knows, "No, this is
your fate. This is your glory." And the last thing

03:55:51.821 --> 03:55:55.915
you see before you all vanish into the water is
him scream and run towards the reformed

03:55:55.915 --> 03:55:58.255
Rakanishu's elemental form.

03:55:58.255 --> 03:56:02.524
LIAM: LRJenkins1234!

03:56:02.524 --> 03:56:05.294
JENNIFER: Your father's proud of you!

03:56:05.294 --> 03:56:12.070
MATT: So at this point, darkness takes over.
You're being rushed around the current. It's

03:56:12.070 --> 03:56:15.472
battering you around at a rapid speed. Even those
of you with darkvision, things are coming by so

03:56:15.472 --> 03:56:23.025
fast that you're only seeing things quick enough
before it impacts you. I need all of you to make a

03:56:23.025 --> 03:56:25.364
perception check. If you have darkvision, you make
it with advantage.

03:56:25.364 --> 03:56:32.426
TALIESIN: 19.

03:56:32.426 --> 03:56:33.911
MATT: Success.

03:56:33.911 --> 03:56:35.177
LAURA: 23.

03:56:35.177 --> 03:56:36.301
TRAVIS: 16.

03:56:36.301 --> 03:56:38.025
JENNIFER: 17.

03:56:38.025 --> 03:56:43.150
MATT: 17? Okay, you all succeed, so you only
suffer three points of bludgeoning damage as you

03:56:43.150 --> 03:56:45.911
guys are being battered around-- oh, you go limp
and unconscious.

03:56:45.911 --> 03:56:47.608
TRAVIS: Oh, you do?!

03:56:47.608 --> 03:56:49.302
JENNIFER: I only had two left.

03:56:49.302 --> 03:56:53.705
MATT: All right, as you're being thrust around
inside, the river's carrying you, and you're

03:56:53.705 --> 03:56:58.762
trying to hold your breath. The air escapes your
lungs. You guys all try your best to hold

03:56:58.762 --> 03:57:04.112
together. You hit another sequence of rock. Using
your perception from before, you still only suffer

03:57:04.112 --> 03:57:12.393
another seven points of bludgeoning amongst you,
so seven, seven-- actually, it would be half, so

03:57:12.393 --> 03:57:21.116
three to each of you. Eventually, after a minute
or so, your lungs begin to burn from holding in

03:57:21.116 --> 03:57:23.304
the air. What's your constitution?

03:57:23.304 --> 03:57:25.558
TRAVIS: 16.

03:57:25.558 --> 03:57:26.568
MATT: What about you?

03:57:26.568 --> 03:57:28.695
LAURA: 13.

03:57:28.695 --> 03:57:29.837
TALIESIN: 14.

03:57:29.837 --> 03:57:34.945
MATT: Okay, so your air begins to escape your
lungs. You can't hold it anymore and you begin to

03:57:34.945 --> 03:57:39.638
drown just as a light comes to you. All of a
sudden, the thrusting of water stops, and you're

03:57:39.638 --> 03:57:46.491
all free-floating in water, and you all begin to
scavenge around for any sense of what's up, what's

03:57:46.491 --> 03:57:51.797
down. The light is below you, the glow, and you
begin to right yourself and realize that that is

03:57:51.797 --> 03:57:56.578
actually above. You look up, and it looks to be
there's a surface of water. You all begin to swim

03:57:56.578 --> 03:58:01.298
up-- at least, those of you that are conscious.
You're struggling and drowning, and you limply

03:58:01.298 --> 03:58:03.529
begin to float to the surface.

03:58:03.529 --> 03:58:06.721
TALIESIN: Is she floating to the surface? I'm
going to follow her up, then.

03:58:06.721 --> 03:58:12.796
MATT: Okay. Make a constitution saving throw.

03:58:12.796 --> 03:58:15.500
TRAVIS: Is my plate mail a problem?

03:58:15.500 --> 03:58:18.966
MATT: You have a high constitution, so you're able
to hold your breath longer.

03:58:18.966 --> 03:58:22.210
(laughter)

03:58:22.210 --> 03:58:24.491
LAURA: Ten?

03:58:24.491 --> 03:58:29.772
MATT: Ten? You go unconscious and begin drowning.

03:58:29.772 --> 03:58:31.872
LAURA: Does that mean I start floating?

03:58:31.872 --> 03:58:36.075
MATT: You're scrambling under the water and go
limp and begin to slowly rise up, as well. Two of

03:58:36.075 --> 03:58:37.923
them begin to rise up in the water.

03:58:37.923 --> 03:58:39.301
LIAM: Rise up.

03:58:39.301 --> 03:58:46.845
MATT: All right, as you guys break the surface,
(gasping) you glance around, gasping in the cold

03:58:46.845 --> 03:58:52.596
air. The blue sky above you is nearly cloudless: a
welcome sight as you recognize the nearby docks

03:58:52.596 --> 03:58:58.371
and humble buildings of Lakeshore, where you once
left. You apparently were jettisoned to the bottom

03:58:58.371 --> 03:59:01.887
of Lake Everstill, and you're just around the
corner from where you started this venture.

03:59:01.887 --> 03:59:07.369
TALIESIN: Healing Word, level two; Healing Word,
level three.

03:59:07.369 --> 03:59:14.142
MATT: Okay, you come to consciousness. She's a
little worse for wear.

03:59:14.142 --> 03:59:18.131
LAURA: Oh no. Do you have Revivify?

03:59:18.131 --> 03:59:23.728
TALIESIN: If I use my Healing Word not knowing
that she was dead-- did I use my Healing Word not

03:59:23.728 --> 03:59:30.584
knowing she was dead? Because I'm out of magic, at
that point, if I've used two Healing Words.

03:59:30.584 --> 03:59:32.884
MATT: Make a medicine check.

03:59:32.884 --> 03:59:34.455
TALIESIN: All right, that'll do.

03:59:34.455 --> 03:59:36.798
LIAM: Also, did his spell reach three miles back?

03:59:36.798 --> 03:59:38.154
MATT: No.

03:59:38.154 --> 03:59:40.192
TALIESIN: Oh! 24.

03:59:40.192 --> 03:59:45.010
MATT: 24? Glancing over as you begin to cast the
spell, you recognize the signs that she is not--

03:59:45.010 --> 03:59:48.455
TALIESIN: Revivify on this one, Healing Word at
level two on this one.

03:59:48.455 --> 03:59:53.283
MATT: Okay, I'll allow that. For the purposes of
this, you reach over, and from the cold shackles

03:59:53.283 --> 04:00:02.431
of death, the spirit of Aerwin, who went on to
greet the goddess Elune, is pulled back into her

04:00:02.431 --> 04:00:05.768
form as she gasps for breath back at the surface
and begins to paddle.

04:00:05.768 --> 04:00:08.523
TALIESIN: Big dwarven punch in the face. Wake up!

04:00:08.523 --> 04:00:15.199
MATT: The four of you slowly scramble and make
your way towards the shores of Lake Everstill.

04:00:15.199 --> 04:00:27.219
Waterlogged and down one ally, you make your way,
beaten and bruised. So you have two satchels of

04:00:27.219 --> 04:00:34.952
no-longer-soft candles, and you make your way
inside Lakeshore Inn, which has another patron

04:00:34.952 --> 04:00:39.844
now, so business is booming. You see as Wental
turns around as you enter and goes, "My goodness,

04:00:39.844 --> 04:00:47.910
"friends! You've returned! Oh, and a little worse
for wear, but where's your friend with the

04:00:47.910 --> 04:00:49.025
"beard?"

04:00:49.025 --> 04:00:50.116
TRAVIS: He died.

04:00:50.116 --> 04:00:52.030
LAURA: He died getting your candles.

04:00:52.030 --> 04:00:53.539
TALIESIN: You owe us lunch.

04:00:53.539 --> 04:00:59.524
MATT: "I'm terribly sorry, but food can be
prepared. That's a shame. But did you get my

04:00:59.524 --> 04:01:00.867
"candles?"

04:01:00.867 --> 04:01:02.065
TRAVIS: Show him the bag.

04:01:02.065 --> 04:01:11.058
MATT: As you dump out a solid rock of wax onto the
wooden table, he glances down.

04:01:11.058 --> 04:01:19.945
LAURA: Those creatures, they had melted all of
your candles already. We saved as much wax as we

04:01:19.945 --> 04:01:21.501
could for you.

04:01:21.501 --> 04:01:30.400
MATT: "Let me go make some breakfast." As he
shell-shockedly makes his way towards the kitchen,

04:01:30.400 --> 04:01:37.082
you all sit down, pull the wooden chairs out, slap
down on the table, water still dripping from your

04:01:37.082 --> 04:01:45.107
armor and clothes. You sit there, grab whatever
half-drunk tankards you left as you exited, finish

04:01:45.107 --> 04:01:53.577
them off, make eye contact, and think, "Man, can
it really be worse up on Argus right about now?"

04:01:53.577 --> 04:01:56.349
And that's where we'll close today's game.

04:01:56.349 --> 04:01:59.710
(cheering)

04:01:59.710 --> 04:02:01.829
LAURA: Oh no, poor Toes!

04:02:01.829 --> 04:02:04.231
LIAM: Will one of you please look after my WoW
account?

04:02:04.231 --> 04:02:09.364
JENNIFER: Absolutely.

04:02:09.364 --> 04:02:11.620
MATT: Thank you guys so much for playing. Thank
you, Jen, for coming and joining us.

04:02:11.620 --> 04:02:16.304
JENNIFER: Thank you! This was so fun. Thank you.
Amazing.

04:02:16.304 --> 04:02:20.319
MATT: Thank you guys for coming and joining us.
Thank you very much to Blizzard for working with

04:02:20.319 --> 04:02:26.699
us and putting this together and letting us play
in Azeroth for a bit. Once again, please check out

04:02:26.699 --> 04:02:32.309
the Kobolds &amp; Catacombs expansion for Hearthstone
releasing on December 7th, and they're streaming

04:02:32.309 --> 04:02:38.134
on the official Blizzard Twitch and YouTube on the
5th for their awesome Kobolds &amp; Catacombs escape

04:02:38.134 --> 04:02:43.633
room. Thank you guys, again. Have a wonderful
night, and is it Thursday yet?

04:02:43.633 --> 04:02:46.875
(cheering)
