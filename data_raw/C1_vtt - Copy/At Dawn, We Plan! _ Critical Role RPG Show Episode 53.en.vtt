00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.781
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:10.299
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around, roll dice, and
play Dungeons and Dragons. We had quite an

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:16.464
interesting episode last week, and leading into
more interesting possibilities this week depending

00:00:16.464 --> 00:00:21.321
on what happens. So, that being the case, let's go
ahead and try and get through these announcements

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:26.222
real fast so we can get to the game. First and
foremost, this is our second week of our fantastic

00:00:26.222 --> 00:00:29.824
Loot Crate sponsorship. Those of you who aren't
familiar with Loot Crate, they're an awesome

00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:43.159
have been members for years, and it's actually
really, really cool stuff and they've been awesome

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:48.203

00:01:09.977 --> 00:01:11.493
TRAVIS: Yeah, mobilize.

00:01:11.493 --> 00:01:19.991
MATT: You also have until the 19th of this month
at 9:00pm to subscribe to receive the next month's

00:01:19.991 --> 00:01:24.879
Loot Crate in time, otherwise the cutoff happens,
and the next one looks pretty cool. So you guys

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:32.802
should definitely try and get into that window if
you can. Let me see. There is a-- oh! Our first

00:01:32.802 --> 00:01:39.023
"Dear Vox Machina" article went up last week,
answered by our fantastic Scanlan Shorthalt over there.

00:01:39.023 --> 00:01:41.029
MARISHA: So funny!

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:43.866
MATT: You can find that on the Geek and Sundry
website. If you haven't had a chance to check it

00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:46.809
out, you can check it out on geekandsundry.com. We
have a new one coming out tomorrow--

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:48.538
SAM: Featuring? Featuring?

00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:53.727
MATT: --featuring, do we know who it's featuring?
Do we know? Vax is helming that one next week, so

00:01:53.727 --> 00:01:59.564
that'll be fun. Check it out at geekandsundry.com
for Vax's answering questions sent to him by

00:01:59.564 --> 00:02:03.491
various people who live all about Tal'Dorei and
beyond.

00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:04.841
LIAM: Let's have a heart-to-heart.

00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:06.627
MATT: Yeah, what could possibly go wrong?

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:07.898
TRAVIS: He walks away.

00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:10.161
MATT: Or hits them in the head with a--

00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:12.623
LIAM: I didn't answer any of them, I just left it
and took a walk.

00:02:12.623 --> 00:02:21.238
MATT: Perfect. I will be a guest at the end of
this month, the last weekend in May, at Momocon in

00:02:21.238 --> 00:02:25.974
Atlanta, as a reminder for all you southern
East-coast folks. Looking forward to coming there

00:02:25.974 --> 00:02:30.265
and doing some panels and such. And then the
weekend after that, the first weekend of June, I

00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:35.002
will be at Akon in Dallas, Texas. So for all you
Texas folk they just finally announced that.

00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:36.642
LAURA: Woo, Dallas.

00:02:36.642 --> 00:02:40.322
MATT: I'm going to these folks' old neck of the
woods. So if you're in that area, come say hi at

00:02:40.322 --> 00:02:44.676
Akon, be a lot of fun. Oh and Travis, you're going
to a convention next weekend.

00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:52.023
TRAVIS: Yeah, Laura and I will be at Puerto Rico
Comic Con next weekend. The 21st and the 22nd, or

00:02:52.023 --> 00:02:57.128
the 20th and the 21st, whatever Saturday and
Sunday is. We'll be there! Come squeeze us, we'll

00:02:57.128 --> 00:02:58.468
sign your books--

00:02:58.468 --> 00:02:59.541
LAURA: Squeeze us?

00:02:59.541 --> 00:03:06.233
TRAVIS: Yeah, come squeeze us. Ahh, sushi burp.
Here we go, it'll be hitting you real soon.

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:12.723
MATT: Everything shrivels. And Taliesin, you will
be at another convention as well.

00:03:12.723 --> 00:03:17.468
TALIESIN: I will, I will be at Amazing Comic Con
in Hawaii next weekend. Actually, I will be

00:03:17.468 --> 00:03:23.997
missing the game because I will be working on my
pale, in the moonlit shores of Hawaii.

00:03:23.997 --> 00:03:26.351
LAURA: I love how well your shirt and your hoodie
match your hair.

00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:27.989
MARISHA: I know, it looks so pretty.

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.639
MATT: That is pretty slick, actually.

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.711
TALIESIN: Thank you. This is as fresh as I can
get. Because I've been sleeping in the studio.

00:03:33.711 --> 00:03:35.587
LAURA: It's pretty fresh. So fresh and so clean.

00:03:35.587 --> 00:03:38.326
MARISHA: You look like a Wicked and Divine
character. It's pretty great.

00:03:38.326 --> 00:03:40.732
LIAM: What color will you be next week?

00:03:40.732 --> 00:03:44.319
TALIESIN: You know, I think I'm going to stick
with the lavender for a while. I think I'm slowly

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.251
going to move it towards amethyst.

00:03:46.251 --> 00:03:49.848
MATT: Hey, I like it.

00:03:49.848 --> 00:03:51.502
TALIESIN: Little green, little blue.

00:03:51.502 --> 00:03:59.444
MATT: Also, as a note, Taliesin is the new host of
Signal Boost. The next run on the show that

00:03:59.444 --> 00:04:03.665
Marisha is the creator and co-producer on, writer,
all that other fun stuff.

00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:08.471
MARISHA: Along with Shaun Becker and Eric
Campbell. Couldn't do it without those guys.

00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:13.022
MATT: You had a fun promo go up this week as a
teaser for it. That was rather fun.

00:04:13.022 --> 00:04:15.998
MARISHA: Check it out. It's very good.

00:04:15.998 --> 00:04:22.610
MATT: Indeed. And I want to say, though it's only
been a couple days past, happy birthday to

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.593
Marisha. Happy birthday this past Tuesday to
Marisha.

00:04:27.593 --> 00:04:30.034
MARISHA: That was added after I sent out the
announcements.

00:04:30.034 --> 00:04:36.687
MATT: That was added right now because I'm your
boyfriend. But yeah, happy birthday.

00:04:36.687 --> 00:04:38.027
MARISHA: Aw, thanks, babe.

00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:39.366
ASHLEY: We love our druid!

00:04:39.366 --> 00:04:40.424
MARISHA: Aw, thanks, guys.

00:04:40.424 --> 00:04:42.711
ALL: Huzzah!

00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:45.883
MATT: Speaking of birthdays, I believe there is a
gift to be given?

00:04:45.883 --> 00:04:49.535
LIAM: Yeah, I don't have an announcement, but I
have a bit of a surprise. This is a little bit

00:04:49.535 --> 00:04:55.348
early, because my sister and I share a birthday on
the 28th. However!

00:04:55.348 --> 00:04:56.534
MARISHA: May birthdays!

00:04:56.534 --> 00:05:01.535
LIAM: It's a big month for birthdays, I'm a little
worried about the next episode or two, if we're

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:07.625
going to survive or not, so the gift that I have I
want to make sure you have it now, just in case.

00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:10.637
It's very timely. Ryan, if you please.

00:05:10.637 --> 00:05:14.174
LAURA: What? What is this thing? Is it a baby bear
cub? Is it a real bear cub?

00:05:14.174 --> 00:05:16.182
MARISHA: Oh, yeah!

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:18.127
LAURA: (gasps)

00:05:18.127 --> 00:05:19.739
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:21.873
MATT: That is fantastic.

00:05:21.873 --> 00:05:27.343
LAURA: Oh. My. Gosh. Shut your face!

00:05:27.343 --> 00:05:28.891
ASHLEY: Lookit! Look at what it says.

00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:30.872
LAURA: Happy birthday twinnie, fly high.

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:35.316
Thanks brother!

00:05:35.316 --> 00:05:38.428
MATT: All the barf. That's so cute!

00:05:38.428 --> 00:05:40.611
LAURA: Oh my god, I want to ride it around right
now.

00:05:40.611 --> 00:05:42.594
SAM: It's got a little bend in it for your butt!

00:05:42.594 --> 00:05:44.814
LAURA: Does it really fly though, that's the
thing.

00:05:44.814 --> 00:05:50.326
LIAM: I don't know, maybe have some padding or
mattresses out the first time you use it.

00:05:50.326 --> 00:05:52.228
LAURA: (squeals) Oh, this is so cool!

00:05:52.228 --> 00:05:54.086
LIAM: I also thought it would look nice in the
house.

00:05:54.086 --> 00:05:58.852
LAURA: It'll look so good in the house! It's so
perfect. It's going to go on the mantle.

00:05:58.852 --> 00:06:01.402
SAM: Hold it up a little higher so the people can
see.

00:06:01.402 --> 00:06:04.804
LAURA: (sings) That was Ariel, singing Little
Mermaid.

00:06:04.804 --> 00:06:06.358
ASHLEY: (sings)

00:06:06.358 --> 00:06:07.838
LAURA: Keep singing!

00:06:07.838 --> 00:06:12.425
LIAM: I'm a big fan of all your decisions, keep
making them.

00:06:12.425 --> 00:06:18.616
LAURA: Thanks, brother. Thank you so much. I don't
have your gift for you here.

00:06:18.616 --> 00:06:20.469
LIAM: Whatevs.

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:24.490
SAM: She dropped it in a portapotty.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.170
LAURA: Make him hold it!

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:31.987
MATT: Make Trinket hold a broom. This is going to
go perfectly. It does actually work!

00:06:31.987 --> 00:06:33.955
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah no, that's rockin'!

00:06:33.955 --> 00:06:35.611
MARISHA: That's perfect!

00:06:35.611 --> 00:06:37.740
ASHLEY: I love it so much.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.469
LAURA: Thank you, that's so wonderful.

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:42.034
LIAM: You're welcome.

00:06:42.034 --> 00:06:45.102
LAURA: Don't steal it, Trinket! You won't fit on
it.

00:06:45.102 --> 00:06:50.063
MATT: Anything else anyone wants to say or shall
we jump into it?

00:06:50.063 --> 00:06:52.567
MARISHA: I guess we should also say thank you,
Hardwick--

00:06:52.567 --> 00:07:02.459
MATT: Thank you Chris Hardwick for letting your
broom be stolen. "Letting." He still messages

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:08.843
occasionally, "Where's my broom?!" It's pretty
great. Anyway. That being the case, let's go ahead

00:07:08.843 --> 00:07:14.759
and jump into tonight's chaos for this episode of
Critical Role.

00:07:14.759 --> 00:08:45.782
[dramatic music]

00:08:45.823 --> 00:08:54.207
MATT: Hello everyone. So, from last week's
episode. Vox Machina, our band of adventurers who

00:08:54.207 --> 00:09:00.172
have found their way into a struggle against a
group called the Chroma Conclave, a collection of

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:05.942
ancient chromatic dragons that have torn across
the landscape of Tal'Dorei and beyond, setting

00:09:05.942 --> 00:09:12.299
ruin to a number of major cityscapes and then
claiming areas as their own after the fact. In

00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:18.728
order to combat this, eventually hopefully their
leader Thordak the Cinder King, a great and

00:09:18.728 --> 00:09:28.092
powerful red dragon, they've been in search of
ways to improve their prowess as heroes in search

00:09:28.092 --> 00:09:32.770
of these artifacts known as the Vestiges of
Divergence, lost from wars long past. After

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:38.449
finding information about these, it was also
discovered that one of their original homesteads,

00:09:38.449 --> 00:09:45.094
Westruun, the actual place where Pike and Grog,
for a large portion of his life, grew up, after

00:09:45.094 --> 00:09:53.374
being sieged by the dragons, had been overtaken by
the Herd of the Storm, of which Grog previously

00:09:53.374 --> 00:10:00.025
ran with for most of his life, and was helmed by
Kevdak, his uncle, a rather cruel and ruthless

00:10:00.025 --> 00:10:06.145
leader, after they had absorbed the River Maw
years beforehand that had swollen to a great size.

00:10:06.145 --> 00:10:11.935
Battled the dragon, and amongst their losses came
to an accord in which they would leave riches for

00:10:11.935 --> 00:10:18.672
the dragon and it would let them be for the time
being. Upon making their way into the town,

00:10:18.672 --> 00:10:28.342
thinning some of the ranks of this ravenous herd,
Travis as Grog threatened Kevdak to a battle

00:10:28.342 --> 00:10:34.939
one-on-one for supremacy of the herd, and quickly
may have gotten in a little over his head. In the

00:10:34.939 --> 00:10:38.684
center of the town square, a great battle
commenced, where after calling to his side his

00:10:38.684 --> 00:10:46.284
friends Vox Machina, a bloody fray that nearly
felled a few of you, through some ingenuity, some

00:10:46.284 --> 00:10:52.120
decent planning, and some trickery of magical item
use, you managed to survive and have Grog deal the

00:10:52.120 --> 00:11:01.012
death blow to Kevdak, amongst all of the watching
herd. After some barely scraping by diplomacy,

00:11:01.012 --> 00:11:08.225
managed to bring it all to a ceasefire for the
time being, freed Kevdak's son, your cousin

00:11:08.225 --> 00:11:16.944
Zanror, who from his bindings seemed to be of a
different mentality, emotional mindset than his

00:11:16.944 --> 00:11:23.595
father was, and is now wishing to-- with the two
of you, being Vox Machina and the remainder of the

00:11:23.595 --> 00:11:28.620
Herd-- bring this fight to the black dragon
itself, pulling themselves from under the thumb of

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:36.832
its rule, thus saving Westruun and your own lives
in the process. You all have brought to life one

00:11:36.832 --> 00:11:43.509
child who was lost in this fray, and are currently
escorting this boy northward towards the temple

00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:54.877
district of Westruun, and that was where we left
off last time. So. As you guys recovered somewhat,

00:11:54.877 --> 00:12:02.349
some of your wounds, taken a breather, begin
walking through the now slowly unrolling streets

00:12:02.349 --> 00:12:07.846
of Westruun, some folks are coming out, some are
still staying in, because there are still various

00:12:07.846 --> 00:12:15.195
druids, warriors of a very aggressive nature
wandering the streets, though sparser than before,

00:12:15.195 --> 00:12:21.040
seeing you guys walk through, as many people do
recognize you through your previous exploits,

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:28.499
building a little sense of security they have not
had for the better part of a week. Making your way

00:12:28.499 --> 00:12:33.045
northward with this little boy, you eventually
find your way into the outskirts of the temple

00:12:33.045 --> 00:12:39.719
district, the very familiar half-toppled stone
wall that in a circular way encompasses this

00:12:39.719 --> 00:12:45.033
portion of the northwestern side of Westruun. What
would you like to do?

00:12:45.033 --> 00:12:51.918
ASHLEY: Well, I would like to make a proposition,
if everybody would like to take a rest, I know I'm

00:12:51.918 --> 00:12:58.418
pretty rough right now and maybe we could go see
if my great-great grandfather is okay.

00:12:58.418 --> 00:13:00.206
LAURA: Of course.

00:13:00.206 --> 00:13:02.183
MARISHA: We were in the process of--

00:13:02.183 --> 00:13:05.202
SAM: Escorting this boy to his home.

00:13:05.202 --> 00:13:06.717
MARISHA: It was the three ladies, right?

00:13:06.717 --> 00:13:09.370
LAURA: But we'll bring him home, then we'll find
your grandfather.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.537
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:13:10.537 --> 00:13:13.263
LAURA: Or we can take him home and meet you.

00:13:13.263 --> 00:13:18.030
ASHLEY: Who-- how-- where is--

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.934
SAM: Little dead boy?

00:13:21.934 --> 00:13:23.375
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:13:23.375 --> 00:13:29.188
MATT: The little boy is still clutching on to
Trinket's fur, riding him behind you, he's got a

00:13:29.188 --> 00:13:33.624
little smile on his face, the dried blood still
covering half of his smile.

00:13:33.624 --> 00:13:38.349
LAURA: Does any of this look familiar to you,
darling?

00:13:38.349 --> 00:13:47.099
MATT: "Yeah. Mom should be up that way." And he
points further down the thoroughfare.

00:13:47.099 --> 00:13:49.215
ASHLEY: It's close.

00:13:49.215 --> 00:13:52.355
LAURA: Yeah. And your grandfather lives in this
area as well.

00:13:52.355 --> 00:13:53.237
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:13:53.237 --> 00:13:55.176
TALIESIN: Don't see why we can't do both.

00:13:55.176 --> 00:13:57.388
SAM: Swing by his house, yeah.

00:13:57.388 --> 00:14:02.038
MATT: "Giddy-up!" And he kicks the side, and
Trinket like, (grunts), lumbers forward.

00:14:02.038 --> 00:14:05.651
LAURA: I pat Trinket's butt. It's okay.

00:14:05.706 --> 00:14:11.669
MATT: Licks your hand begrudgingly and continues
forward, plodding on the cobblestone. For a while,

00:14:11.669 --> 00:14:16.918
eventually the boy, looking for familiar sights,
some of the buildings have taken some damage in

00:14:16.918 --> 00:14:22.851
the initial black dragon onslaught, he does
suddenly point his finger forward and goes,

00:14:22.851 --> 00:14:30.084
"That's it! That's it!" And you go past a couple
of humble buildings, and then you start getting

00:14:30.084 --> 00:14:35.451
into the slum section. I say slum, it's where the
poor people in the temple district live when

00:14:35.451 --> 00:14:43.071
they're not tending to temples or businesses that
are surrounded by this district. You can see it's

00:14:43.071 --> 00:14:50.618
a functional, it's a standing hovel, but it's
mainly a scrap wood roof, bits of thatch to help

00:14:50.618 --> 00:15:00.894
maintain any protection against rainfall. The wood
looks old, some of it may have been rotted, but

00:15:00.894 --> 00:15:06.209
treated since. It's functional. But the boy jumps
off Trinket.

00:15:06.209 --> 00:15:07.644
LAURA: Oh, be careful!

00:15:07.644 --> 00:15:12.010
MATT: Doesn't even pay attention to you, runs up
to the door and hits the door and it's solid. He

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:18.073
goes and pulls on it and it seems to be closed, so
he goes, "Mommy? Mommy?" He seems genuinely

00:15:18.073 --> 00:15:20.501
excited, but also trying to get in the front
door.

00:15:20.501 --> 00:15:22.016
LAURA: I walk up behind.

00:15:22.016 --> 00:15:27.521
MARISHA: I whisper to Pike and be like, mm, we
didn't think about this potential outcome, did we?

00:15:27.521 --> 00:15:35.594
LAURA: Hello? Is anyone home? It's relatively
safe--er. Than it was.

00:15:35.594 --> 00:15:38.532
MATT: Time passes. What are you doing?

00:15:38.532 --> 00:15:40.357
ASHLEY: Can I check the door, if it's locked?

00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:46.828
MATT: The door itself doesn't have a knob per se,
it has a small dark iron handle that's bolted to

00:15:46.828 --> 00:15:50.485
it, but you pull it and something's holding it
back, like there's something actually barring it

00:15:50.485 --> 00:15:52.096
from the other side.

00:15:52.096 --> 00:15:53.861
ASHLEY: That's a good thing.

00:15:53.861 --> 00:15:57.115
MATT: A few moments pass. Silence.

00:15:57.115 --> 00:16:01.295
MARISHA: Child, how long has it been since you've
been away from your home?

00:16:01.295 --> 00:16:09.017
MATT: "They just pulled me out today." Then you
hear a voice come from the other side of the

00:16:09.017 --> 00:16:15.490
wooden door, peeking through the space. "Hello?"

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:18.251
LAURA: Knock-knock, we have your son, safe and
sound.

00:16:18.251 --> 00:16:19.851
MARISHA: Delivery.

00:16:19.851 --> 00:16:23.101
LAURA: Special delivery for child's mum.

00:16:23.101 --> 00:16:30.302
MATT: "Theodore?" And the boy goes, "Yes? Mom?
Please please please! There's nice people out here."

00:16:30.302 --> 00:16:36.533
And you hear the shifting of wood onto the
side, the door opens ever so slightly and on the

00:16:36.533 --> 00:16:46.478
inside you can see a pale and scared-looking
woman, clean, simple clothing, has some sort of

00:16:46.478 --> 00:16:55.923
half-torn apron on that's wrapped around a simple
peasant blouse. She has her hair up in this small

00:16:55.923 --> 00:17:03.164
cloth cap and she pushes through. "Theodore!"
Opens the door and picks him up and wraps him in

00:17:03.164 --> 00:17:08.395
her arms and holds him for a second, not even
paying attention to any of you, and there's this

00:17:08.395 --> 00:17:14.302
moment where you can see the fear that has been
stuck in her mind since he was pulled from the

00:17:14.302 --> 00:17:19.826
inside of their abode slowly abated with the
return. Eventually she stops and her eyes come up

00:17:19.826 --> 00:17:27.755
over his shoulder to the rest of you. "I'm sorry,
pardon my manners, I'm Yulia. Thank you."

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:33.447
LAURA: Of course. Well.

00:17:33.447 --> 00:17:46.807
MATT: Puts Theodore down. "Hold on, let me--" She
goes and steps inside of her home. Eventually a

00:17:46.807 --> 00:17:51.088
few moments later she comes back and she has a
small handful of coins.

00:17:51.088 --> 00:17:52.927
LAURA: No, darling, put that away.

00:17:52.927 --> 00:17:55.145
MATT: "I-- it's the least I can do."

00:17:55.145 --> 00:17:56.557
TRAVIS: Is that it?

00:17:56.557 --> 00:18:00.005
LAURA: Truly, put that away.

00:18:00.005 --> 00:18:03.140
MARISHA: It's not what we did this for. It's fine.
We're just glad he's home safe.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.849
LAURA: And not even slightly dead!

00:18:05.849 --> 00:18:07.524
MARISHA: Nope! Not a scratch!

00:18:07.524 --> 00:18:09.409
ASHLEY: He's fine, just nothing even happened.

00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:14.446
MARISHA: If he has weird dreams-- don't worry
about it. Children, you know.

00:18:14.446 --> 00:18:18.728
MATT: Her eyes are partially trained on Grog as
she now notices you, she steps further out of the

00:18:18.728 --> 00:18:21.806
house, she's like, "Is everything okay now?"

00:18:21.806 --> 00:18:23.298
LAURA: Oh yeah, he killed the bad guy.

00:18:23.298 --> 00:18:29.302
TRAVIS: We're under new management now, going to
be a lot of changes around here. For the better.

00:18:29.302 --> 00:18:37.665
MATT: "Okay. Thank you." She cups the coins back
into her hand, reaches down and rubs Theodore's

00:18:37.665 --> 00:18:42.229
hair, looks at the blood that's still there and
looks a little worried for a second.

00:18:42.229 --> 00:18:45.543
LAURA: I think it's paint, I think it might be
paint, they were painting.

00:18:45.543 --> 00:18:47.300
MATT: "Is he going to be all right?"

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.875
MARISHA: Oh yeah, he's great.

00:18:48.875 --> 00:18:51.992
SAM: We had spaghetti for lunch.

00:18:51.992 --> 00:18:54.264
LAURA: Quite an adventure.

00:18:54.264 --> 00:18:56.249
MATT: "Thank you."

00:18:56.249 --> 00:18:59.632
MARISHA: Give him a little hot cocoa, warm
blanket, he'll be fine.

00:18:59.632 --> 00:19:03.486
MATT: "Better go clean you up. Go clean you up."
And he's like, "Okay!" And he runs in behind her

00:19:03.486 --> 00:19:06.103
as she turns again and takes the door and pauses
for a moment looking out at you and says once

00:19:06.103 --> 00:19:09.718
again, very quietly under her breath, "Thank
you."

00:19:09.718 --> 00:19:17.822
LAURA: Have you-- sorry. Have you seen a small
elderly-- an older gnome?

00:19:17.822 --> 00:19:21.769
MATT: "Wilhand?"

00:19:21.769 --> 00:19:24.249
LAURA: Yes, have you seen him, is he all right?

00:19:24.249 --> 00:19:28.080
MATT: "We've been staying inside since the
incursion came."

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.399
LAURA: All right.

00:19:30.399 --> 00:19:37.050
MATT: "The few that I have seen were not under
good circumstances. But the fact that I haven't

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:38.582
"seen him might be a good thing."

00:19:38.582 --> 00:19:39.618
LAURA: Yes.

00:19:39.618 --> 00:19:44.587
SAM: Do you know if they were hiding anywhere? If
anyone else went anywhere specifically to hide?

00:19:44.587 --> 00:19:52.265
MATT: "Not a lot of places to hide. Only certain
areas in the sewers are safe, and our homes are

00:19:52.265 --> 00:19:57.947
"the best places, if we knew our way around our own
homes. We had a hiding spot, but Theodore got away

00:19:57.947 --> 00:20:03.539
"from us, hearing all the noise, and they managed to
take him away."

00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:05.321
TRAVIS: Where did you hide?

00:20:05.321 --> 00:20:13.821
MATT: She brings you guys inside and it's very,
very plain in the interior, it's very cold, you

00:20:13.821 --> 00:20:21.074
can see there is a small firepit with a cauldron
over it that's used for making simple soups and

00:20:21.074 --> 00:20:25.053
whatever food they prepare in here. There is a
portion of the roof that is open to allow any sort

00:20:25.053 --> 00:20:31.458
of smoke to pass through, but it does have some
runoff to let any sort of water fall off outside

00:20:31.458 --> 00:20:37.907
the window. She heads back behind where the cold
cauldron is, and where the stones are set up to

00:20:37.907 --> 00:20:43.862
guard the back from catching any of the wood
behind it, she goes and pulls on one of the pieces

00:20:43.862 --> 00:20:50.599
of stone, and as she pulls it back it's a false
front of stone that pulls open. There's a small

00:20:50.599 --> 00:20:58.310
cabinet there that you see there used to be a--
religion check, for those who are trained in it.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.739
Or who are skilled in it.

00:21:00.739 --> 00:21:02.372
LAURA: Trained in it.

00:21:02.372 --> 00:21:04.097
ASHLEY: You can try.

00:21:04.097 --> 00:21:05.984
MATT: Have a proficiency.

00:21:05.984 --> 00:21:09.753
ASHLEY: 20.

00:21:09.753 --> 00:21:16.972
MATT: Okay. You see, even a quick glance, there's
a small broken statue that lies to the ground, and

00:21:16.972 --> 00:21:24.456
you can see the semblance of a destroyed shrine.
This back room was a shrine to Melora, and has

00:21:24.456 --> 00:21:31.870
since been seemingly tossed aside in the hurried
state of trying to protect one's family.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.559
MARISHA: Can I reach down and pick up the statue?

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:41.838
MATT: It's in three pieces. As you pick it up, she
goes, "Oh, I'm so sorry, we--" She goes for your

00:21:41.838 --> 00:21:46.063
hand and goes, "I didn't-- hopefully she'll
forgive us, I know she will."

00:21:46.063 --> 00:21:48.435
MARISHA: Tell me about this deity.

00:21:48.435 --> 00:21:50.166
MATT: "Melora?"

00:21:50.166 --> 00:21:51.623
MARISHA: Melora.

00:21:51.623 --> 00:21:56.327
MATT: And you've heard Melora, it's a whole
section of Vasselheim that is based around her

00:21:56.327 --> 00:22:03.401
sphere of influence, and she is actually where
most of the food in Vasselheim is grown in such a

00:22:03.401 --> 00:22:09.649
cold environment, her blessing is what allows the
land there to be fertile for crops from many

00:22:09.649 --> 00:22:10.853
different places.

00:22:10.853 --> 00:22:12.048
TRAVIS: Sweet.

00:22:12.048 --> 00:22:17.550
MATT: But she tells you, and you can see the
symbols too, the symbols that are carved in the

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:27.527
side of the stone are these swirls, almost like a
slow cascading spiral. She says, "Melora watches

00:22:27.527 --> 00:22:33.084
"over nature, she watches to make sure we have a
good harvest, she makes sure we don't get washed

00:22:33.084 --> 00:22:39.392
"away in the storms, she makes sure that the ships
to the far west make their passage across the

00:22:39.392 --> 00:22:51.395
"ocean, she looks out for us smaller folk and
brings vengeance upon those who attempt to destroy

00:22:51.395 --> 00:22:59.546
"our life." As she looks distantly out the open
door behind you into the city itself. "But anyway,

00:22:59.546 --> 00:23:02.774
"I'll repair that."

00:23:02.774 --> 00:23:13.621
MARISHA: I might be able to help. Can I attempt--
hang on-- can I attempt a Mending spell on it?

00:23:13.621 --> 00:23:21.264
MATT: Yes, you can. You take a moment, close your
hands around it, close your eyes, and you can see

00:23:21.264 --> 00:23:28.112
what little bit of dried grass or moss that's
gathered at the edges of the stone all of a sudden

00:23:28.112 --> 00:23:33.188
spreads and encompasses all the pieces of stone as
you're holding it together. She takes a step back,

00:23:33.188 --> 00:23:40.101
her eyes full of wonder, as the moss then turns
dark brown, like a shell of soft vegetation, and

00:23:40.101 --> 00:23:44.403
then cracks and falls away, leaving behind the
stone statue in one piece.

00:23:44.403 --> 00:23:45.850
LAURA: That's sick!

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:47.312
TRAVIS: Sweet!

00:23:47.312 --> 00:23:56.798
MARISHA: I hand it over, and I tell her, I'm a
druid of the Ashari people and I know several

00:23:56.798 --> 00:24:04.836
worshippers of Melora, but wasn't necessarily a
believer of her powers.

00:24:04.836 --> 00:24:07.067
MATT: "She protects you, too."

00:24:07.067 --> 00:24:10.049
MARISHA: And you're sure of this?

00:24:10.049 --> 00:24:15.317
MATT: She looks over to her child, who's now
sitting on the side, pulled a couple of these

00:24:15.317 --> 00:24:18.650
wooden toys out from the side and is gathering
them in his arms and is grabbing all the things

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:26.388
that he missed while he was taken away, and she
says, "She brought you to me. She brought you to him."

00:24:26.388 --> 00:24:33.779
MARISHA: Why should I believe?

00:24:33.779 --> 00:24:41.795
MATT: "She'll show you. In her own way."

00:24:41.795 --> 00:24:46.021
MARISHA: Thank you, my lady.

00:24:46.021 --> 00:24:51.676
MATT: She takes the statue and, "Well, if there's
anything else I can do for you."

00:24:51.676 --> 00:25:00.761
TRAVIS: Yes, actually. You should leave. I don't
mean that in the way that it sounded, sorry, back

00:25:00.761 --> 00:25:11.746
up. So, come tomorrow, there might be danger in
Westruun. You and your kin should go. In fact,

00:25:11.746 --> 00:25:16.837
anyone that you see, take them with you, there's a
little encampment not far from here.

00:25:16.837 --> 00:25:20.020
SAM: There is?

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.399
TRAVIS: Yeah, all the shanty area of people--

00:25:23.399 --> 00:25:24.795
SAM: Oh, oh, the refugees.

00:25:24.795 --> 00:25:28.704
MATT: They were south of here by Foromir Basin.

00:25:28.704 --> 00:25:30.394
SAM: South, north, northwest. South.

00:25:30.394 --> 00:25:38.429
TRAVIS: It's over by Foromir Basin. Head for that
if you can.

00:25:38.429 --> 00:25:40.342
SAM: Look for no trees.

00:25:40.342 --> 00:25:47.959
MATT: She takes a mental note. "No trees. All
right. I haven't been that far south. Should we

00:25:47.959 --> 00:25:51.982
"get the others, should we tell others to come with
us? If there is danger here--"

00:25:51.982 --> 00:25:56.689
SAM: We're going to fight here? I thought we were
going to do this out of town.

00:25:56.689 --> 00:26:05.231
TRAVIS: There's a fight coming here. You don't
want to be here. Don't be too obvious about it, on

00:26:05.231 --> 00:26:11.965
the sly, if you can, but try and make your way out
of here before dawn tomorrow.

00:26:11.965 --> 00:26:21.642
MATT: "Okay, we will. Theodore? Start gathering
your things, we're taking a little trip."

00:26:21.642 --> 00:26:23.293
LAURA: A fun trip.

00:26:23.293 --> 00:26:27.364
MATT: He goes, "A trip! Yay!" And starts gathering
more of his things, he gets a pillow case and

00:26:27.364 --> 00:26:31.859
starts putting stuff into it. "We haven't done a
trip-- we haven't done a trip!"

00:26:31.859 --> 00:26:34.691
"I know. Thank you."

00:26:34.691 --> 00:26:43.858
TRAVIS: On second thought, should we ask them to
leave on the sly, like, through the sewers? Just

00:26:43.858 --> 00:26:44.998
in case.

00:26:44.998 --> 00:26:46.529
MARISHA: I wouldn't make a show of it.

00:26:46.529 --> 00:26:48.802
TRAVIS: So maybe underground if they can.

00:26:48.802 --> 00:26:49.954
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:26:49.954 --> 00:26:52.426
TALIESIN: I think we're going to have-- are we
here? I can't remember.

00:26:52.426 --> 00:26:54.015
MATT: Yeah, you're all together.

00:26:54.015 --> 00:26:58.150
MARISHA: I thought we weren't either, I thought it
was just the girls but then everyone started talking.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:03.403
LIAM: And then Grog was here. Reality is very
malleable.

00:27:03.403 --> 00:27:10.882
TALIESIN: I think we're going to have to have a
larger conversation about where everybody ends up

00:27:10.882 --> 00:27:20.104
in the very near future, and while two people in
and out of town is definitely agreeable, I think

00:27:20.104 --> 00:27:22.341
there's a larger discussion to be had.

00:27:22.341 --> 00:27:25.063
LIAM: I have an odd question for you.

00:27:25.063 --> 00:27:26.249
MATT: "Yes?"

00:27:26.249 --> 00:27:32.274
LIAM: Do you know of anyone still in the city who
would know their way about the sewers?

00:27:32.274 --> 00:27:42.439
MATT: "I mean-- usually the guards would go
through and make sure that the things that were

00:27:42.439 --> 00:27:48.484
"living down there weren't living anymore, but-- I
don't know anyone in particular that worked down

00:27:48.484 --> 00:27:50.523
"there. Sorry."

00:27:50.523 --> 00:27:52.318
LIAM: It's fine.

00:27:52.318 --> 00:27:53.691
SAM: I know someone.

00:27:53.691 --> 00:27:54.891
TALIESIN: You do?

00:27:54.891 --> 00:27:56.217
SAM: Yeah.

00:27:56.217 --> 00:28:00.063
MARISHA: Why don't we let this woman return to the
rest of her day?

00:28:00.063 --> 00:28:04.171
TALIESIN: We have more appointments as well. Much
to do today.

00:28:04.171 --> 00:28:06.473
LAURA: (whispering) One last question, this is it,
I swear.

00:28:06.473 --> 00:28:07.579
MATT: "Okay?"

00:28:07.579 --> 00:28:11.069
LAURA: Are you familiar with anyone in the farming
area just outside of town?

00:28:11.069 --> 00:28:15.342
MATT: "I've seen some folks come and go."

00:28:15.342 --> 00:28:20.065
LAURA: We're looking for a woman who was a
daughter of one of the gentlemen that worked in

00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:24.170
the fields, and we really have no idea how to go
about finding her.

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:25.567
TRAVIS: (whispering) Reginald.

00:28:25.567 --> 00:28:27.274
LAURA: Reginald's daughter, yes.

00:28:27.274 --> 00:28:30.524
MATT: "Reginald's daughter. I'll ask."

00:28:30.524 --> 00:28:33.786
LAURA: All right. You know where to find us, we'll
be about.

00:28:33.786 --> 00:28:35.079
MATT: "All right."

00:28:35.079 --> 00:28:37.056
TALIESIN: I think I know who to have that
discussion with as well.

00:28:37.056 --> 00:28:40.929
SAM: Good day. Oh?

00:28:40.929 --> 00:28:46.030
ASHLEY: I go over to Theodore and-- I don't think
I have to bend down.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:50.110
MATT: No, no, he's maybe half an inch shorter than
you.

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:56.466
ASHLEY: I had a little wooden doll, and so I'm
going to pass it to him and say, in case we never

00:28:56.466 --> 00:29:03.437
see you again, you can always think of us when you
play with this. That's for you. And you can name

00:29:03.437 --> 00:29:05.296
him whatever you want.

00:29:05.296 --> 00:29:07.152
MATT: "What's your name?"

00:29:07.152 --> 00:29:08.228
ASHLEY: Pike.

00:29:08.228 --> 00:29:14.137
MATT: "I will name you Pike." Throws it in the
pillowcase. Says, "Thank you!" Gives you a quick

00:29:14.137 --> 00:29:15.937
little kiss on the forehead.

00:29:15.937 --> 00:29:18.028
MATT: Pulling more things in the pillowcase.

00:29:18.028 --> 00:29:19.157
ASHLEY: Theodore!

00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:21.222
LIAM: So much better alive than dead.

00:29:21.222 --> 00:29:23.519
LAURA: I know! I mean, good thing he never died.

00:29:23.519 --> 00:29:28.290
LIAM: Hey, a rare ray of sunshine from the DM
today.

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.935
SAM: Let's continue on.

00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:32.499
TRAVIS: Don't poke him.

00:29:32.499 --> 00:29:38.563
MATT: You guys say your goodbyes, she lets you go
and she locks the door behind and you gather

00:29:38.563 --> 00:29:44.529
they're making their necessary preparations. Where
to next?

00:29:44.529 --> 00:29:46.067
TALIESIN: Pike.

00:29:46.067 --> 00:29:47.895
SAM: To Wilhand's.

00:29:47.895 --> 00:29:49.291
ASHLEY: Follow me, please.

00:29:49.291 --> 00:29:58.429
MATT: All right. Not too far away, actually, you
come to the red brick homestead where Pike, Grog,

00:29:58.429 --> 00:30:07.063
and Wilhand live. Mostly intact. The second floor,
which you guys are definitely familiar with--

00:30:07.063 --> 00:30:10.155
LIAM: Hey, I remember this place! Wow.

00:30:10.155 --> 00:30:14.661
MATT: --part of it has fallen in, doesn't look
like it's been set fire or any serious damage in

00:30:14.661 --> 00:30:18.430
that regard, some sort of nearby rubble or some
sort of impact caused part of the roof to collapse

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:29.265
from the outside. You come up to the front door.
It's currently locked.

00:30:29.265 --> 00:30:32.521
ASHLEY: That's a good sign. I think that's a good
sign.

00:30:32.521 --> 00:30:34.296
TRAVIS: Do you want to knock?

00:30:34.296 --> 00:30:35.525
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:30:35.525 --> 00:30:39.945
MATT: No answer.

00:30:39.945 --> 00:30:41.659
LAURA: You have a secret knock you maybe used?

00:30:41.659 --> 00:30:44.850
TRAVIS: Maybe you should say who's knocking, just
in case. You do knock so strong.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:52.067
ASHLEY: Pop-Pop Wilhand? It's Pike!

00:30:52.067 --> 00:30:53.781
TALIESIN: Well, I heard that.

00:30:53.781 --> 00:30:58.137
MATT: Nothing.

00:30:58.137 --> 00:31:01.232
LAURA: He might have very soft footfalls.

00:31:01.232 --> 00:31:02.717
TALIESIN: He might not be home.

00:31:02.717 --> 00:31:04.717
MARISHA: Is he old and hard of hearing?

00:31:04.717 --> 00:31:11.962
ASHLEY: A little, he could-- a little. Vax? Would
you mind? Maybe you'll get some luck with this door.

00:31:11.962 --> 00:31:17.663
MATT: Technically, Pike, you do have the keys to
the home.

00:31:17.663 --> 00:31:19.301
LIAM: I mean, I can do it if you want to.

00:31:19.301 --> 00:31:21.961
ASHLEY: Wait, hold on, I forgot that somewhere in
this armor--

00:31:21.961 --> 00:31:24.661
TALIESIN: No, he needs this, he needs this, it's
all right, absolutely needs this.

00:31:24.661 --> 00:31:26.332
SAM: I'll explode the door!

00:31:26.332 --> 00:31:33.304
ASHLEY: All that clanking is actually this key
moving about my armor. All right.

00:31:33.304 --> 00:31:35.534
MATT: Unlocks the door.

00:31:35.534 --> 00:31:37.429
LIAM: That key has seen a lot of miles.

00:31:37.429 --> 00:31:39.742
MARISHA: Been around the world.

00:31:39.742 --> 00:31:41.564
MATT: You push and the door hits something.

00:31:41.564 --> 00:31:42.762
SAM: Damn it. Doors.

00:31:42.762 --> 00:31:44.994
MATT: It like budges maybe a quarter-inch.

00:31:44.994 --> 00:31:46.890
LAURA: He's barricaded the door, that's a good
thing, that's a really good thing.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:53.092
ASHLEY: I go to the crack. Pop-Pop Wilhand! It's
Pike!

00:31:53.092 --> 00:31:55.577
LAURA: I go and look through the window, is there
a window?

00:31:55.577 --> 00:32:00.843
MATT: There is a window, there is cloth shuttered
around it, you cannot see in the inside.

00:32:00.843 --> 00:32:05.248
LIAM: And the hole in the roof. Could I get up
it?

00:32:05.248 --> 00:32:10.328
MATT: You could probably get up there if you
wanted. Go ahead and make a-- make an athletics check.

00:32:10.328 --> 00:32:11.588
LIAM: All right.

00:32:11.588 --> 00:32:13.356
TALIESIN: Bugger all, I say we give it a shove.

00:32:13.356 --> 00:32:17.231
LIAM: Eh, 14.

00:32:17.231 --> 00:32:23.378
MATT: It takes you a few minutes, but you
eventually climb your way up, looking down into

00:32:23.378 --> 00:32:30.294
the second floor. Part of the roof is fully pushed
in, it looks like there's a piece of wayward stone

00:32:30.294 --> 00:32:34.296
that was ejected from an impact not too far from
here, possibly from one of the nearby temples,

00:32:34.296 --> 00:32:38.198
that ended up slamming through the roof. It's
partially embedded in the ground, the wood's

00:32:38.198 --> 00:32:43.386
splintered up around it, but it didn't hit the
bottom floor, it lodged itself in the floor of the second.

00:32:43.386 --> 00:32:45.920
LIAM: Hear anything, see anything inside?

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.931
LAURA: What do you see? Oh. Well.

00:32:48.931 --> 00:32:56.953
MATT: Are you at the bottom floor? Bottom floor,
all, there is some furniture that's busted, but a

00:32:56.953 --> 00:33:02.032
lot of the furniture's all been pushed right to
the front door. There's a giant barricade of

00:33:02.032 --> 00:33:07.146
mishmashed furniture that is jammed impossibly
into this front area.

00:33:07.146 --> 00:33:08.527
ASHLEY: He's very strong.

00:33:08.527 --> 00:33:10.312
TALIESIN: We're going to give a push to the front
door.

00:33:10.312 --> 00:33:14.234
MATT: More amusing when you consider that there's
a glass window right next to it that is not

00:33:14.234 --> 00:33:15.849
blocked at all, shuttered so carefully.

00:33:15.849 --> 00:33:20.277
LIAM: There's a window, there's nothing in front
of it, you want to come in the window?

00:33:20.277 --> 00:33:22.121
TALIESIN: We give a shove.

00:33:22.121 --> 00:33:23.467
MARISHA: We give a big shove.

00:33:23.467 --> 00:33:30.401
MATT: Make a strength check, with advantage we'll
say as you-- well, him, having advantage you're helping.

00:33:30.401 --> 00:33:32.290
MARISHA: Oh, him having advantage because I'm
helping.

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:35.302
TALIESIN: Oh. 18. Is my strength.

00:33:35.302 --> 00:33:40.112
MATT: 18. You guys have to slam it a few times,
and the impact lodges a few things loose. Come

00:33:40.112 --> 00:33:45.201
cascading down, causing a bit of a racket, but
eventually you manage to get it pushed open enough

00:33:45.201 --> 00:33:46.878
where you guys can squeeze through.

00:33:46.878 --> 00:33:49.854
LIAM: You just broke a chaise lounge, but come
in.

00:33:49.854 --> 00:33:52.802
LAURA: Pike, after you.

00:33:52.802 --> 00:34:00.026
ASHLEY: Okay. I step in and start looking around.

00:34:00.026 --> 00:34:05.921
MATT: Looking across the way, you see the
fireplace mantle has been ruined where the

00:34:05.921 --> 00:34:11.172
original small shrine to Sarenrae used to be,
looks like it's been knocked over and then put

00:34:11.172 --> 00:34:17.198
back together on top haphazardly, like it was
shattered and then was put up there and is

00:34:17.198 --> 00:34:24.230
delicately keeping its form by how it was laid.
The rest of the room is cold. It's quiet other

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:25.888
than your footfalls.

00:34:25.888 --> 00:34:28.928
ASHLEY: Can I check the bedroom?

00:34:28.928 --> 00:34:36.155
MATT: Okay. You go up to the bedroom area. As you
go up the stairs, you can see the giant piece of

00:34:36.155 --> 00:34:41.490
stone that's smashed in there, where the bed would
be in part of the bedroom area.

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:44.973
LAURA: Pike, did he have any hiding places, like
that other house?

00:34:44.973 --> 00:34:46.366
TRAVIS: I go with her.

00:34:46.366 --> 00:34:49.466
TALIESIN: I'm going to look around for personal
effects, papers.

00:34:49.466 --> 00:34:51.254
MATT: Make an investigation check, both of you
guys.

00:34:51.254 --> 00:34:53.778
LIAM: Is there a basement here, Pike?

00:34:53.778 --> 00:34:57.585
LAURA: 18.

00:34:57.585 --> 00:34:59.723
TALIESIN: 15.

00:34:59.723 --> 00:35:01.129
MATT: What were you going to say?

00:35:01.129 --> 00:35:02.701
ASHLEY: There are hiding places.

00:35:02.701 --> 00:35:11.168
MATT: You guys go through the kitchen area, and as
you are looking about, moving stuff, in the pantry

00:35:11.168 --> 00:35:18.354
area there is a small wooden slat that is
partially moved across that leaves a small opening

00:35:18.354 --> 00:35:20.322
in the floorboards.

00:35:20.322 --> 00:35:22.663
LAURA: Percy! Wilhand?

00:35:22.663 --> 00:35:24.069
TALIESIN: Hello?

00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:27.796
MATT: "Shh! I'm not here!"

00:35:27.796 --> 00:35:31.015
TALIESIN: Pike, I've got good news, he says he's
not here!

00:35:31.015 --> 00:35:32.574
ASHLEY: Okay, I go running down.

00:35:32.574 --> 00:35:37.172
MATT: Okay, you run and you push stuff out of the
way. There's the one board that's slid open, all

00:35:37.172 --> 00:35:41.697
the rest of the boards are still loose and placed
over it. Do you just take the boards and toss 'em up?

00:35:41.697 --> 00:35:42.838
ASHLEY: I just pull them off.

00:35:42.838 --> 00:35:45.761
MATT: As you pull the boards off, what little bit
of light has made its way from the window on the

00:35:45.761 --> 00:35:49.994
far end of the kitchen, you can see a bit of
glimmer off a set of glasses that immediately

00:35:49.994 --> 00:35:51.655
recoil in the shadow and go, "Oh!"

00:35:51.655 --> 00:35:53.773
ASHLEY: Pop-Pop Wilhand!

00:35:53.773 --> 00:36:00.742
MATT: "Pike? Oh my goodness." And his hand reaches
out and grabs yours and you pull him up and he's

00:36:00.742 --> 00:36:06.898
covered in dust and dirt and he's probably been
down there-- the smell, probably been down there

00:36:06.898 --> 00:36:08.121
for a few days.

00:36:08.121 --> 00:36:10.424
ASHLEY: I give him a big hug.

00:36:10.424 --> 00:36:16.794
MATT: You give him a big hug, he has long, ratty,
silver hair that's bald on the top, bowled on the

00:36:16.794 --> 00:36:24.789
sides, curled up and matted on the edges of his
shoulders. His normally nice light blue, sky blue

00:36:24.789 --> 00:36:30.920
shirt is torn in places and covered in dirt. He
has been living under the house for quite a while.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:35.968
There's a little bit of dried food crusted on the
side of his chin. But he's there with a big ol'

00:36:35.968 --> 00:36:39.668
hug. "Pike, I missed you so much."

00:36:39.668 --> 00:36:42.083
ASHLEY: I missed you so much, I'm so glad you're
okay.

00:36:42.083 --> 00:36:47.737
MATT: "Look at you, look at you. Where'd you get
this scar? Oh."

00:36:47.737 --> 00:36:49.344
ASHLEY: Long story, we'll get there.

00:36:49.344 --> 00:36:52.076
MATT: "I want to hear this story-- and it's
Grog!"

00:36:52.076 --> 00:36:53.636
TRAVIS: Hello Wilhand!

00:36:53.636 --> 00:36:57.753
MATT: Runs up, goes to give you a hug and goes,
"Oh! Come down, come down."

00:36:57.753 --> 00:37:00.165
TRAVIS: Oh, no-- yes. Take it easy.

00:37:00.165 --> 00:37:11.952
MATT: "You big guy." And his eyes go from really
warm to suddenly very cold, and he goes, "They

00:37:11.952 --> 00:37:16.065
"came back for me. They came back for me. I saw 'em
in the street."

00:37:16.065 --> 00:37:20.866
TRAVIS: I know, it's all right. It's all right,
Wilhand. It's all been taken care of.

00:37:20.866 --> 00:37:22.384
MATT: "They didn't find me though, they didn't
find me."

00:37:22.384 --> 00:37:23.319
TRAVIS: You hid.

00:37:23.319 --> 00:37:26.028
MATT: "I did, and they didn't find me at all.
There was no way they could find me. I know where

00:37:26.028 --> 00:37:27.331
"the secret places are."

00:37:27.331 --> 00:37:29.284
TRAVIS: I see where Pike gets her smarts from.

00:37:29.284 --> 00:37:30.635
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:37:30.635 --> 00:37:34.471
MATT: "So. It's been a while! All of you!"

00:37:34.471 --> 00:37:39.202
MATT: And he starts going around and giving each
of you-- you guys got the hugs, he's giving you

00:37:39.202 --> 00:37:40.670
the formal like, "Oh, yes."

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:43.015
TRAVIS: This is Vex, this is Vax.

00:37:43.015 --> 00:37:44.868
LAURA: He knows us, Grog.

00:37:44.868 --> 00:37:46.334
MATT: "Yes, I remember."

00:37:46.334 --> 00:37:47.358
MARISHA: Keyleth, hello.

00:37:47.358 --> 00:37:48.437
MATT: "Been a while."

00:37:48.437 --> 00:37:50.238
TALIESIN: I don't actually think we've met before,
hello.

00:37:50.238 --> 00:37:52.825
MATT: "No, you're unfamiliar to me. Nice to see
you again."

00:37:52.825 --> 00:37:53.880
SAM: Scanlan, Scanlan.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:58.333
MATT: "Always nice to see a fellow gnome in these
parts. You are?"

00:37:58.333 --> 00:38:02.513
TALIESIN: Ah, Percival Frederickstein Von Musel
Klossowski de Rolo III, it's a pleasure to meet

00:38:02.513 --> 00:38:05.030
you. Hello. Hi.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:06.772
MATT: "Right!" And he pats your shoulder.

00:38:06.772 --> 00:38:10.316
TALIESIN: That took some doing, well done. I'll
lean down for that.

00:38:10.316 --> 00:38:15.865
MATT: "So. You need to hide too?"

00:38:15.865 --> 00:38:20.467
ASHLEY: There was a very big battle. And Grog beat
Kevdak.

00:38:20.467 --> 00:38:21.721
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:38:21.721 --> 00:38:26.760
ASHLEY: Chopped him in half! Straight down the
middle. Filleted him.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.673
MATT: "I knew you would! You've always been the
strong one."

00:38:30.673 --> 00:38:33.296
ASHLEY: So everything's a little bit more
under control, hopefully.

00:38:33.296 --> 00:38:34.813
MARISHA: A little.

00:38:34.813 --> 00:38:36.351
ASHLEY: Mm. Ish.

00:38:36.351 --> 00:38:38.074
MARISHA: Wilhand.

00:38:38.074 --> 00:38:39.235
MATT: "Yes?"

00:38:39.235 --> 00:38:43.386
MARISHA: Did they want something in particular
with you? Why did they want you?

00:38:43.386 --> 00:38:51.319
MATT: "Well, they went after me years ago, nearly
had me."

00:38:51.319 --> 00:38:54.316
MARISHA: I've heard the story, yes.

00:38:54.316 --> 00:38:55.667
MATT: "But I escaped."

00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:56.733
MARISHA: I've heard.

00:38:56.733 --> 00:38:58.572
MATT: "I managed to flee, and took one of their
own with me."

00:38:58.572 --> 00:38:59.741
MARISHA: I know.

00:38:59.741 --> 00:39:01.275
MATT: "Nursed this one back to health, we did."

00:39:01.275 --> 00:39:02.488
TRAVIS: Thank goodness.

00:39:02.488 --> 00:39:08.147
MATT: "And I think I made 'em angry, so they came
to Westruun trying to get revenge on old Wilhand,

00:39:08.147 --> 00:39:11.775
"but no, too keen for that, these eyes have seen
the world!"

00:39:11.775 --> 00:39:13.863
MARISHA: You think the goliaths--

00:39:13.863 --> 00:39:15.334
LAURA: Yes, well of course they did!

00:39:15.334 --> 00:39:17.440
TRAVIS: Yep, that's the only reason they came
here.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.296
LAURA: Who hasn't heard the legend of Wilhand?

00:39:20.296 --> 00:39:22.908
MATT: "Not many actually, I don't get out very
often."

00:39:22.908 --> 00:39:24.946
TALIESIN: They cry your name across the--

00:39:24.946 --> 00:39:27.626
LAURA: The seven seas?

00:39:27.626 --> 00:39:30.659
MATT: "No no no no. Don't give me a big head about
it, it's fine."

00:39:30.659 --> 00:39:32.566
SAM: I've written many a song about you, it's
true.

00:39:32.566 --> 00:39:39.940
MATT: "Well, if they're all dead, let's have a
meal!"

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:46.510
TRAVIS: Little misunderstanding, they're not all
dead. We unseated Kevdak.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.049
MATT: "Okay."

00:39:48.049 --> 00:39:54.796
TRAVIS: He's dead. And so was the horrible bastard
who was pouring poison in his ear. But listen, I

00:39:54.796 --> 00:39:59.270
gave power up to the Herd, to Zanror, his son.

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:00.505
MATT: "Okay."

00:40:00.505 --> 00:40:04.006
TRAVIS: So it's in slightly better hands. Little
problem--

00:40:04.006 --> 00:40:05.088
MATT: "Right."

00:40:05.088 --> 00:40:10.045
TRAVIS: They want to stay and fight the dragon
that's going to come back.

00:40:10.045 --> 00:40:11.151
MATT: "Okay."

00:40:11.151 --> 00:40:16.866
TRAVIS: So we need everyone in here to leave.

00:40:16.866 --> 00:40:18.095
MATT: "Perfect."

00:40:18.095 --> 00:40:19.128
LAURA: Perfect?

00:40:19.128 --> 00:40:20.020
MATT: "Yes."

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.306
LAURA: Perfect in what way, leaving or fighting
the dragon?

00:40:22.306 --> 00:40:25.510
MATT: "Dragon? What?!"

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:26.805
TRAVIS: Sorry, yes.

00:40:26.805 --> 00:40:28.619
MARISHA: You were aware, right?

00:40:28.619 --> 00:40:31.098
MATT: (terrified noise)

00:40:31.098 --> 00:40:34.102
MARISHA: Okay. Yes. Yes, that one.

00:40:34.102 --> 00:40:37.362
MATT: And he starts walking back towards the
hole.

00:40:37.362 --> 00:40:40.172
ALL: No, no no no!

00:40:40.172 --> 00:40:45.551
TRAVIS: I grab the back of his britches and I pull
him back. Nope, nope, Wilhand.

00:40:45.551 --> 00:40:52.417
ASHLEY: Hey, guess what though? We've fought many
dragons already. And guess what, I killed one!

00:40:52.417 --> 00:40:53.894
MARISHA: Two, three-ish?

00:40:53.894 --> 00:40:55.335
ASHLEY: Two or three.

00:40:55.335 --> 00:41:06.076
MATT: "That's my Pike! Then this is nothing! The
dragonslayer, Pike Trickfoot,

00:41:06.076 --> 00:41:07.847
"come again to kill another!"

00:41:07.847 --> 00:41:08.955
TRAVIS: That's how she's known.

00:41:08.955 --> 00:41:10.926
MATT: "Great. Wondrous."

00:41:10.926 --> 00:41:11.978
TRAVIS: Ruthless.

00:41:11.978 --> 00:41:13.620
MATT: "Let me know when it's dead."

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.544
ALL: No, no no no.

00:41:15.544 --> 00:41:20.478
ASHLEY: It's okay right now.

00:41:20.478 --> 00:41:26.835
TRAVIS: We're glad you're safe. We want to make
sure you're out of here before any real damage

00:41:26.835 --> 00:41:28.451
comes to town.

00:41:28.451 --> 00:41:33.760
MARISHA: We're also going to need any and all
recruits that you may know of, or any favors you

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.049
can call in. If we are in fact going to fight this
dragon?

00:41:38.049 --> 00:41:40.321
TRAVIS: We haven't quite talked about--

00:41:40.321 --> 00:41:42.375
LAURA: We really should have a conversation about
that.

00:41:42.375 --> 00:41:44.979
TRAVIS: But what is known is that there's going to
be a fight tomorrow.

00:41:44.979 --> 00:41:46.996
TALIESIN: There's probably going to be a fight
tomorrow.

00:41:46.996 --> 00:41:51.360
TRAVIS: And unless you want to throw down, and I
know you're a mighty warrior, not saying you

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:56.251
shouldn't, but if you don't want to, now might be
the time to hop-skip out of here.

00:41:56.251 --> 00:41:58.103
TALIESIN: There's no shame in prudence.

00:41:58.103 --> 00:42:00.926
TRAVIS: No, no, not in the hole!

00:42:00.926 --> 00:42:06.866
MATT: He swats your hand away and goes, "Heh."
Goes back down into the hole, you can hear him

00:42:06.866 --> 00:42:12.141
rummaging a little bit, something falls and
shatters. (incoherent grumbling) Eventually he

00:42:12.141 --> 00:42:19.978
comes back out clutching a dark brown glass bottle
with a cork in it, and he goes, "I'm going to need

00:42:19.978 --> 00:42:23.548
"some of this. Ugh."

00:42:23.548 --> 00:42:25.468
TRAVIS: Well, don't be stingy.

00:42:25.468 --> 00:42:29.655
MATT: "This is the Trickfoot Special. Been
distilling while you were away."

00:42:29.655 --> 00:42:32.510
LIAM: How much you got of that, old man?

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:34.956
MATT: "Ah, about two casks."

00:42:34.956 --> 00:42:37.899
ASHLEY: All right. I drink the whole rest of the
bottle.

00:42:37.899 --> 00:42:44.770
MATT: It is awful. It is like potato moonshine in
its most basic form. It is--

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:46.388
LAURA: Pike's going to be so fucked up.

00:42:46.388 --> 00:42:55.109
MATT: You probably singed your eyebrows just
putting the bottle near your face, which you don't

00:42:55.109 --> 00:43:00.491
realize, halfway through the bottle as you drink it,
you pick up, oh, it burns. This burns.

00:43:00.491 --> 00:43:03.083
TRAVIS: Welcome to Ren Faire.

00:43:03.083 --> 00:43:05.202
TALIESIN: Original recipe Windex. My favorite.

00:43:05.202 --> 00:43:07.333
ASHLEY: It's a little stronger than I remember
it.

00:43:07.333 --> 00:43:09.602
LIAM: Hey, Pike's at disadvantage for the rest of
the day.

00:43:09.602 --> 00:43:21.536
ASHLEY: Oh no. Would you all-- there's plenty
more, would you all like to join me and have a sip?

00:43:21.536 --> 00:43:23.769
SAM: I'm okay, I'm okay for now.

00:43:23.769 --> 00:43:25.303
TRAVIS: Yeah, hook it up, homie.

00:43:25.303 --> 00:43:27.873
TALIESIN: It's been a day. I will.

00:43:27.873 --> 00:43:32.603
MATT: "Let me get the cups." And he goes and opens
the cabinet and there's shattered glass. "Okay, no cups."

00:43:32.603 --> 00:43:34.617
MARISHA: It's fine.

00:43:34.617 --> 00:43:35.868
MATT: "Bottle it is."

00:43:35.868 --> 00:43:37.163
SAM: Pass the bottle.

00:43:37.163 --> 00:43:40.518
MATT: You guys pass the bottle around, finish off
the bottle, it's--

00:43:40.518 --> 00:43:41.848
LAURA: Finish the bottle?

00:43:41.848 --> 00:43:43.672
MATT: Well, she took most of it.

00:43:43.672 --> 00:43:52.523
ASHLEY: I think we should make a meal. He's a very
good cook.

00:43:52.523 --> 00:43:55.246
SAM: Is the kitchen even functional here?

00:43:55.246 --> 00:43:56.569
LIAM: Is there food?

00:43:56.569 --> 00:43:58.181
LAURA: You know what we should do?

00:43:58.181 --> 00:44:00.472
MARISHA: Eat food and talk about a plan?

00:44:00.472 --> 00:44:03.506
LAURA: Bring him into the mansion.

00:44:03.506 --> 00:44:05.112
TALIESIN: We could bring him into the mansion.

00:44:05.112 --> 00:44:06.635
SAM: We do need time to rest and plan.

00:44:06.635 --> 00:44:09.005
TALIESIN: We still have one more stop before the
evening's done.

00:44:09.005 --> 00:44:13.800
LAURA: You can show his people that work at the
mansion how to cook, 'cause they are terrible, I

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.293
can tell you that much.

00:44:15.293 --> 00:44:16.605
SAM: They're great at one dish.

00:44:16.605 --> 00:44:17.723
MATT: "You have a mansion?"

00:44:17.723 --> 00:44:21.603
SAM: I do! I'm quite successful as gnomes go, in
fact, before we--

00:44:21.603 --> 00:44:24.227
MATT: "Pike. He has a mansion."

00:44:24.227 --> 00:44:28.097
ASHLEY: He does. He does have a mansion. It's a
magic mansion.

00:44:28.097 --> 00:44:29.905
TRAVIS: Is Wilhand drunk right now?

00:44:29.905 --> 00:44:34.199
MATT: He looks like he's coping with the past
week's events.

00:44:34.199 --> 00:44:36.232
TRAVIS: Insight check his soberness.

00:44:36.232 --> 00:44:38.623
LAURA: He's been drunk the whole time.

00:44:38.623 --> 00:44:44.564
SAM: Should we make the mansion, get Wilhand a
room, and then go to our last destination of this

00:44:44.564 --> 00:44:47.182
night before we turn in?

00:44:47.182 --> 00:44:48.663
TRAVIS: Yeah, we could do that.

00:44:48.663 --> 00:44:54.364
LIAM: Yeah Grog, how long do you reckon we have
before your cousin wants to either talk or get busy?

00:44:54.364 --> 00:44:57.924
TRAVIS: I don't know.

00:44:57.924 --> 00:45:01.191
SAM: Are we supposed to meet up with him later
tonight?

00:45:01.191 --> 00:45:07.334
TRAVIS: He said, at dawn, we-- Wait, at dawn we
fight, or at dawn we plan?

00:45:07.334 --> 00:45:13.331
MARISHA: I don't think I've ever heard anyone say "at
dawn, we plan." So I'm going to assume--

00:45:13.331 --> 00:45:14.672
ASHLEY: At dawn, we plan!

00:45:14.672 --> 00:45:16.687
SAM: At dawn, we rise and make a plan!

00:45:16.687 --> 00:45:17.928
TALIESIN: At dawn, we quorum!

00:45:17.928 --> 00:45:20.745
MARISHA: At dawn, we Microsoft Excel!

00:45:20.745 --> 00:45:30.216
MATT: You get the sense he meant at dawn, to make
an aggressive action.

00:45:30.216 --> 00:45:32.408
TALIESIN: So we have two stops before the evening's
done then.

00:45:32.408 --> 00:45:36.068
LAURA: Wait, where are we going?

00:45:36.068 --> 00:45:37.862
SAM: There's a house we're supposed to plunder.

00:45:37.862 --> 00:45:39.866
TALIESIN: There's a house we're supposed to
plunder, and we should plunder it.

00:45:39.866 --> 00:45:41.224
TRAVIS: Aw, really, do we give a shit about it?

00:45:41.224 --> 00:45:42.153
TALIESIN: Yes, we do.

00:45:42.153 --> 00:45:43.209
TRAVIS: No, you're right, we do.

00:45:43.209 --> 00:45:45.455
LAURA: Oh right, Master Quall.

00:45:45.455 --> 00:45:49.911
TALIESIN: Master Quall, and I will admit, I'm
vaguely indifferent about whether or not he gets

00:45:49.911 --> 00:45:55.775
his property back, but I am very keen to find out
what that property is, and what else he left if he

00:45:55.775 --> 00:45:57.042
left that.

00:45:57.042 --> 00:46:02.266
TRAVIS: Why don't we set up the mansion in
Wilhand's house, we'll go and run our errand, and

00:46:02.266 --> 00:46:05.367
we'll come back and he'll have gotten the kitchen
all up to spec.

00:46:05.367 --> 00:46:10.835
LIAM: Yeah, seeing as we might be tangling with a
black dragon tomorrow, an old one, I think maybe

00:46:10.835 --> 00:46:13.142
that stuff off you're talking about--

00:46:13.142 --> 00:46:14.369
TALIESIN: --god forbid.

00:46:14.369 --> 00:46:18.529
LIAM: No, I don't think it's a good idea, but if
it should happen-- if we get, I wanted to say

00:46:18.529 --> 00:46:24.917
railroaded into it, but I don't know what that is.
We'll probably need every bit of edge we can get,

00:46:24.917 --> 00:46:29.046
so I actually agree with you for the moment,
Percival, we should stop by this house.

00:46:29.046 --> 00:46:31.367
TALIESIN: This is terrifying and this is proof
that we should do it, then.

00:46:31.367 --> 00:46:42.616
MARISHA: Can we get an early, 12 Angry Men raise
of hands on who if they want to fight the dragon

00:46:42.616 --> 00:46:44.654
or not? Do we want to do this?

00:46:44.654 --> 00:46:47.437
TALIESIN: Who wants to fight the dragon tomorrow?

00:46:47.437 --> 00:46:58.010
SAM: Yeah, I'm down. We've got 40 goliaths with
us, this is the best time to attack. No? I'm alone here?

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:01.311
LAURA: It's true, it's true, I mean, it could be
one of the best times to attack.

00:47:01.311 --> 00:47:05.811
TALIESIN: I would like to do three more days of
research and planning--

00:47:05.811 --> 00:47:08.355
TRAVIS: So can we make the door? Wilhand's
starting to turn green.

00:47:08.355 --> 00:47:10.702
LIAM: I mean, it's a big conversation that we
should have.

00:47:10.702 --> 00:47:11.884
SAM: Let's table it.

00:47:11.884 --> 00:47:13.725
LIAM: The where-when-how is pretty huge.

00:47:13.725 --> 00:47:16.702
TRAVIS: Wilhand, just give me the bottle, take it
easy.

00:47:16.702 --> 00:47:19.198
TALIESIN: I feel that that's not something we do
spur of the moment.

00:47:19.198 --> 00:47:24.515
SAM: All right. Let's get this man to safety and
then we'll finish up our errands for the day, yes?

00:47:24.515 --> 00:47:26.531
LAURA: Is there anything you want to bring with
you?

00:47:26.531 --> 00:47:43.296
MATT: "Uh--" He starts walking over to the shrine,
and he takes it off with his hand. "That's all I

00:47:43.296 --> 00:47:46.170
"need." As the head rolls off.

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:51.246
TRAVIS: Never saw anything.

00:47:51.246 --> 00:47:52.533
ASHLEY: We'll fix it.

00:47:52.533 --> 00:47:59.651
MATT: "It's fine. They took ol' Davin, too."

00:47:59.651 --> 00:48:01.596
SAM: What, who?

00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:04.197
MATT: Davin was your neighbor.

00:48:04.197 --> 00:48:06.805
ASHLEY: Davin was my neighbor.

00:48:06.805 --> 00:48:09.160
SAM: Is he gone, is he dead?

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.648
MARISHA: Didn't we meet Davin?

00:48:10.648 --> 00:48:12.340
MATT: You didn't meet Davin, no.

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:25.393
MATT: "They dragged a bunch to the iron stocks. I
could only hide. Your uncle's a coward, Pike. I'm

00:48:25.393 --> 00:48:31.665
"sorry. I should've helped." You get the sense now
the alcohol's kicked in and he's started to go

00:48:31.665 --> 00:48:33.837
through his emotional process now.

00:48:33.837 --> 00:48:36.839
LAURA: He's your uncle? I thought he was your
grandfather.

00:48:36.839 --> 00:48:39.148
ASHLEY: He's my great-grandfather.

00:48:39.148 --> 00:48:40.318
SAM: And uncle?

00:48:40.318 --> 00:48:41.357
LIAM: He's drunk.

00:48:41.357 --> 00:48:42.381
MATT: Very drunk.

00:48:42.381 --> 00:48:46.948
TALIESIN: Come on, no more of that talk.

00:48:46.948 --> 00:48:51.900
LIAM: Grandfather. Let me carry that for you,
before you drop it. I'll keep it safe. I'll keep

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:56.099
it safe for you. You don't want the head to fall
off it.

00:48:56.099 --> 00:49:01.245
MATT: "No, its head's fine. Okay." Passes it
over.

00:49:01.245 --> 00:49:03.617
LIAM: I subtly pick up the head from the ground.

00:49:03.617 --> 00:49:09.395
ASHLEY: So we can put him in the mansion?

00:49:09.395 --> 00:49:10.911
SAM: All right, yes, I'll make the mansion.

00:49:10.911 --> 00:49:16.597
ASHLEY: All right. I kiss him on his forehead and
say: it's going to be okay. Go in there, take a

00:49:16.597 --> 00:49:18.595
nap, and show them how to cook.

00:49:18.595 --> 00:49:24.075
MATT: "I will. You come back soon, my dumpling."
And he squeezes your cheek a little bit.

00:49:24.075 --> 00:49:27.683
(whispers) "He has a mansion."

00:49:27.683 --> 00:49:28.911
ASHLEY: (whispers) What?

00:49:28.911 --> 00:49:30.349
MATT: (whispers) "A mansion!"

00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:32.546
LAURA: (whispers) And he's super interested in
her.

00:49:32.546 --> 00:49:35.463
MATT: "You're of marrying age, young Pike."

00:49:35.463 --> 00:49:38.262
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

00:49:38.262 --> 00:49:42.748
ASHLEY: We'll talk about it later.

00:49:42.748 --> 00:49:44.311
MATT: "I'll tell you how it is."

00:49:44.311 --> 00:49:45.323
ASHLEY: What?

00:49:45.323 --> 00:49:47.048
MATT: "Mansion. I'll tell you how it is."

00:49:47.048 --> 00:49:49.359
ASHLEY: Oh, I've been there! You can go stay--

00:49:49.359 --> 00:49:50.928
MATT: "You've been to his mansion?"

00:49:50.928 --> 00:49:55.030
ASHLEY: I have my own room. You can go stay in my
room.

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:57.204
MATT: "I don't know if I want to--"

00:49:57.204 --> 00:49:58.875
ASHLEY: Hey Scanlan, how will he know which room
is my room?

00:49:58.875 --> 00:50:00.968
SAM: Your room is the one covered in rose petals.

00:50:00.968 --> 00:50:06.654
MATT: "Show me the mansion."

00:50:06.654 --> 00:50:17.866
SAM: So I will cast the spell, I'll sit down and
start humming. (singing) My house is a very, very,

00:50:17.866 --> 00:50:23.823
very fine house. With chickens everywhere. It used
to be so fair--

00:50:23.823 --> 00:50:31.065
MATT: As the shimmering doorway is conjured in the
center of the room.

00:50:31.065 --> 00:50:33.395
SAM: I take him in, I show him to his room.

00:50:33.395 --> 00:50:40.700
MATT: The door opens and he looks inside. "Whoa."
Turns around to you, looking at you through the

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.947
doorway. "It's big."

00:50:42.947 --> 00:50:44.458
ASHLEY: It's very big.

00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:50.773
SAM: Here, come with me. I take him upstairs, take
him to his room. And before I bid him adieu I say:

00:50:50.773 --> 00:50:56.790
later tonight we can discuss more, but I would
like to ask for your granddaughter's hand in

00:50:56.790 --> 00:51:01.415
marriage. But I'll need your permission first.

00:51:01.415 --> 00:51:10.926
MATT: I need you to roll a hell of a persuasion
check on this one.

00:51:10.926 --> 00:51:12.400
LIAM: Roll for initiative, Sam.

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.223
ASHLEY: Roll for initiative.

00:51:14.223 --> 00:51:16.191
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

00:51:16.191 --> 00:51:22.176
SAM: Well, it's a 20.

00:51:22.176 --> 00:51:23.535
MARISHA: Shut up!

00:51:23.535 --> 00:51:24.873
SAM: But that's low for me.

00:51:24.873 --> 00:51:26.250
TALIESIN: No, it is.

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:34.107
MATT: He goes: "I'll think about it. I'd like to
see more of your fine abode."

00:51:34.107 --> 00:51:41.601
SAM: I call for five servants, and I instruct them
to take him wherever he'd like to go and give him

00:51:41.601 --> 00:51:42.943
whatever he needs.

00:51:42.943 --> 00:51:45.187
LIAM: (Wilhand voice) "Wine cellar!"

00:51:45.187 --> 00:51:47.848
MATT: They begin taking him on a tour of the grand
estate.

00:51:47.848 --> 00:51:49.449
SAM: Don't be cheap with the chicken!

00:51:49.449 --> 00:51:56.683
All right, so I scoot out back to rejoin our
friends.

00:51:56.683 --> 00:51:57.629
MATT: Okay.

00:51:57.629 --> 00:51:59.664
TALIESIN: I assume at some point we're taking a
short rest, by the way.

00:51:59.664 --> 00:52:02.741
MATT: You guys took a short rest the end of the
last session.

00:52:02.741 --> 00:52:03.978
TALIESIN: Oh lordy, thank you.

00:52:03.978 --> 00:52:07.703
MATT: So if you wanted to use any hit dice to heal
yourself at that time.

00:52:07.703 --> 00:52:14.034
ASHLEY: I would like to go check my room out and
see how it is. See if it's okay, any damage.

00:52:14.034 --> 00:52:22.355
MATT: Your room is intact. It's a little dirty and
some of the crumbled stone and roof part pushed

00:52:22.355 --> 00:52:27.002
its way into the room across the floor, but for
the most part your room is intact. Wilhand's room,

00:52:27.002 --> 00:52:30.930
which was the main room on the upper floor, was
the one that got destroyed by the fallen rubble.

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:34.527
ASHLEY: Right.

00:52:34.527 --> 00:52:37.432
MATT: All right. What's the plan?

00:52:37.432 --> 00:52:44.573
SAM: Should we split the party and send a few
people to pillage this house that we were

00:52:44.573 --> 00:52:45.951
instructed to pillage?

00:52:45.951 --> 00:52:47.654
TALIESIN: We can all do it. Let's do it together.

00:52:47.654 --> 00:52:50.022
MARISHA: Yes, I feel like this would be a group
outing.

00:52:50.022 --> 00:52:56.018
ASHLEY: I wanted to grab something under the bed.
I'm going to take it and I'm going to hide it.

00:52:56.018 --> 00:52:57.563
MATT: Okay.

00:52:57.563 --> 00:53:03.170
SAM: But there was some talk of needing someone to
take us through the sewers, and I can go fetch

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:05.002
someone who knows the sewers.

00:53:05.002 --> 00:53:09.077
LIAM: I think we need to maybe have a talk about
what we're doing.

00:53:09.077 --> 00:53:10.600
TALIESIN: Talk before that happens.

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:14.311
LIAM: Before finding your friend.

00:53:14.311 --> 00:53:15.900
MARISHA: Time is of the essence.

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:18.981
LIAM: You're talking about Mr. D, I know, yeah.

00:53:18.981 --> 00:53:21.359
SAM: Well, or someone with him, yes.

00:53:21.359 --> 00:53:24.600
LIAM: Right. It's a good idea, but I think we need
to figure out what we're doing first.

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.958
SAM: Sure. What are we doing?

00:53:26.958 --> 00:53:28.907
LIAM: I have no fucking clue.

00:53:28.907 --> 00:53:30.467
MARISHA: What are we doing, actually?

00:53:30.467 --> 00:53:32.011
TALIESIN: First, we're robbing an old man.

00:53:32.011 --> 00:53:34.004
TRAVIS: Can we walk and talk?

00:53:34.004 --> 00:53:35.829
LAURA: Yeah, we walk and talk.

00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:38.240
SAM: Where's Master Quall's--

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.102
LAURA: It's at the fountain crossroads--

00:53:41.102 --> 00:53:43.046
SAM: --brick two-story house near the fountain?

00:53:43.046 --> 00:53:47.004
MARISHA: Before we walk and talk, do we get the
general idea that it's safe to walk through the

00:53:47.004 --> 00:53:53.925
city right now without being murdered? Considering
we just put on the most epic Avengers-style display.

00:53:53.925 --> 00:53:57.346
MATT: Right, and some people are coming to the
streets, though moving quickly from destination to

00:53:57.346 --> 00:54:04.024
destination. Word has gotten around and there's
been a general sense of release throughout the

00:54:04.024 --> 00:54:11.884
city. You do pass a few of the Herd members, some
of which are gathering their supplies, gathering

00:54:11.884 --> 00:54:16.124
their arms, some of them are dragging the bodies
of friends that had died in previous frays or just

00:54:16.124 --> 00:54:23.325
haven't been tended to. And all of them keep a
very intense eye on you. Nothing aggressive, but

00:54:23.325 --> 00:54:25.842
not friendly either.

00:54:25.842 --> 00:54:31.838
TALIESIN: I think we have to convince Kevdak to
abandon this plan to attack the dragon--

00:54:31.838 --> 00:54:33.618
LIAM: He's dead, he's not going to do it.

00:54:33.618 --> 00:54:37.030
TALIESIN: Oh, no, Kevdak, wrong one, I'm sorry.
You all look vaguely the same to me, I'm sorry.

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:39.639
LAURA: Percival!

00:54:39.639 --> 00:54:40.799
LIAM: Except for this one.

00:54:40.799 --> 00:54:44.500
TALIESIN: No, he's got the beard. And the ability
to kill me in my sleep.

00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:46.669
TRAVIS: I'm a unique little snowflake, I take no
offense.

00:54:46.669 --> 00:54:48.924
TALIESIN: I find you charming.

00:54:48.924 --> 00:54:50.012
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:54:50.012 --> 00:54:53.924
TALIESIN: But no, we have to convince them not to
do this tomorrow.

00:54:53.924 --> 00:54:55.145
TRAVIS: Really?

00:54:55.145 --> 00:55:00.117
LAURA: Well, honestly, isn't the dragon going to
come pick up its loot in the next couple days?

00:55:00.117 --> 00:55:01.653
It's happening tomorrow?

00:55:01.653 --> 00:55:08.292
TALIESIN: I think that perhaps if it's possible to
convince them to at least wait one more cycle to

00:55:08.292 --> 00:55:09.908
heal and prepare for the battle--

00:55:09.908 --> 00:55:16.237
TRAVIS: I don't know if we'll be alive in the
morning. I don't know if it's occurred to any of

00:55:16.237 --> 00:55:22.985
you, but I don't particularly feel safe. I'm glad
we got out of there--

00:55:22.985 --> 00:55:24.695
LAURA: I'm glad we have a mansion to hide in.

00:55:24.695 --> 00:55:30.044
TRAVIS: I'm glad we have a mansion, I'm glad we
have a Vestige because of it, but look, I got

00:55:30.044 --> 00:55:34.424
abandoned once. Think anything's changed since
then?

00:55:34.424 --> 00:55:39.773
LAURA: They're not good people. They killed a lot
of innocents.

00:55:39.773 --> 00:55:42.513
TALIESIN: I genuinely don't understand the place
you come from.

00:55:42.513 --> 00:55:47.110
TRAVIS: No, neither do I. But I don't really
understand much things.

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:51.728
TALIESIN: I feel much better about any decision to
just leave then, although we would have to do

00:55:51.728 --> 00:55:53.746
something about the city and everyone who's in
it.

00:55:53.746 --> 00:55:57.856
LIAM: Yeah, there's a lot to think about, there
are a lot of people still here, and I personally

00:55:57.856 --> 00:56:04.023
don't think attacking that dragon in the next few
days is a wise decision. But if we do leave, what

00:56:04.023 --> 00:56:08.337
do we do with these people? They're going to be
run over by these people.

00:56:08.337 --> 00:56:15.975
LAURA: It's possible we can wait for all of the
goliaths and other barbarians to attack the

00:56:15.975 --> 00:56:22.197
dragon, and when they all leave the city, we bar
them out, take the city back.

00:56:22.197 --> 00:56:25.274
SAM: And hold it against a dragon?

00:56:25.274 --> 00:56:31.231
LAURA: Well. The dragon could be content fighting
them. We take the time and get everyone else out

00:56:31.231 --> 00:56:32.660
of the city.

00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:37.980
TALIESIN: Are they clever enough to attack the
dragon at the point at which the drop is made, or

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:43.370
are they going to not make the drop and wait for
the dragon to attack the city?

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:47.097
TRAVIS: Look, if it was the day before yesterday I
would have said they're all fools and they're

00:56:47.097 --> 00:56:52.694
going to do it the stupid way, but I think I
underestimated 'em a bit, so yeah. I think they

00:56:52.694 --> 00:56:54.238
might be a bit clever.

00:56:54.238 --> 00:56:59.360
MARISHA: We also have your cousin Zanror now at
the head, which seems a little bit more clever

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.808
than Kevdak ever was.

00:57:00.808 --> 00:57:02.063
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:57:02.063 --> 00:57:07.072
TALIESIN: We also have to empty out the prisons if
we get that chance of any of the citizens they may

00:57:07.072 --> 00:57:08.428
be holding.

00:57:08.428 --> 00:57:15.045
MARISHA: Well, look, it's not a bad call, the
dragons seem to be interested in the power that

00:57:15.045 --> 00:57:19.789
they hold over the people. There's no people, no
power.

00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:23.420
TALIESIN: Will your cousin understand that we have
a bigger battle to fight?

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:25.632
TRAVIS: No.

00:57:25.632 --> 00:57:27.914
LAURA: On the other hand--

00:57:27.914 --> 00:57:30.510
SAM: This is our battle, we're trying to kill
these dragons!

00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:33.989
LAURA: --when are we going to have a better
opportunity to kill a fucking dragon than with 40

00:57:33.989 --> 00:57:37.043
giant strapping--

00:57:37.043 --> 00:57:41.486
SAM: Two Vestiges, an army of 40 barbarians.

00:57:41.486 --> 00:57:44.123
LIAM: Are we going to have this discussion right
here, in the street?

00:57:44.123 --> 00:57:46.459
TALIESIN: Well, we're walking while we're having
it.

00:57:46.459 --> 00:57:52.650
LIAM: How are we going to deal with one of the
largest dragons we've ever seen in the air? What

00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:58.271
are 40 goliaths going to do with something 500
feet above us, spitting bile from above?

00:57:58.271 --> 00:58:00.500
MARISHA: He has to land to get his treasure.

00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:03.327
SAM: We're going to have to make that plan at some
point.

00:58:03.327 --> 00:58:06.196
TALIESIN: If I had time, if I had a few days--

00:58:06.196 --> 00:58:08.091
LIAM: You've got a day and a half, maximum.

00:58:08.091 --> 00:58:12.225
MARISHA: If we had a little bit of time or if
we're really, really smart, we could theoretically

00:58:12.225 --> 00:58:16.450
rig the most epic dragon trap ever.

00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:18.048
TALIESIN: We could.

00:58:18.048 --> 00:58:23.903
LIAM: Do you think your cousin would hold for a
couple more days? Could he see the sense of

00:58:23.903 --> 00:58:25.294
planning that longer?

00:58:25.294 --> 00:58:28.238
LAURA: We can't leave the people in this city
under the rule of any more of these monsters.

00:58:28.238 --> 00:58:30.503
TALIESIN: Which is why we should get them to
flee.

00:58:30.503 --> 00:58:32.435
LAURA: We have to get people out.

00:58:32.435 --> 00:58:39.699
MARISHA: Right, because even if we somehow by some
insane chance defeat the dragon, cool, we've

00:58:39.699 --> 00:58:43.624
defeated the dragon and now the city is still
under control by the Herd.

00:58:43.624 --> 00:58:46.029
TALIESIN: Well, the Herd will leave, I think.

00:58:46.029 --> 00:58:49.139
LAURA: Will they? After they ransack everything
again?

00:58:49.139 --> 00:58:51.040
LIAM: Well, that's what Grog pitched to them.

00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:55.735
TRAVIS: Here's my vote, so I can have it said. I
would rather get everyone that doesn't want to die

00:58:55.735 --> 00:59:02.179
in this town out to that encampment. If we take
this meeting with Zanror, we will no longer be

00:59:02.179 --> 00:59:09.858
able to walk away. There could be a total chance
that they all turn on us right then. In the throne

00:59:09.858 --> 00:59:16.179
room, in the yard, wherever we are. We could leave
now.

00:59:16.179 --> 00:59:19.783
LAURA: How do we get everyone out?

00:59:19.783 --> 00:59:23.046
MARISHA: You and Zanror seemed to have a mutual
respect.

00:59:23.046 --> 00:59:28.790
TRAVIS: Yeah, because I just saved his life. For a
second. I also beat his ass when he was little,

00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:32.698
and let me tell you a thing about grudges: they
don't go away.

00:59:32.698 --> 00:59:36.503
MARISHA: So you don't think he would hesitate in a
second to turn on us?

00:59:36.503 --> 00:59:41.860
TRAVIS: No, he's a little man, and little men have
Napoleon complexes. He's this horrible elf from

00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:42.866
the West.

00:59:42.866 --> 00:59:44.566
SAM: I do have a Napoleon complex.

00:59:44.566 --> 00:59:46.220
TALIESIN: I've seen it, it's huge.

00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:55.106
ASHLEY: But if everybody is out of the town, and
it's empty, then won't the dragon know?

00:59:55.106 --> 00:59:57.215
TALIESIN: Yes. It'll be furious.

00:59:57.215 --> 00:59:58.792
ASHLEY: And then won't he leave?

00:59:58.792 --> 01:00:00.534
LAURA: And he'll come find us.

01:00:00.534 --> 01:00:07.176
LIAM: Anything we do here, anything we do to that
dragon, anything we do in the city is likely to be

01:00:07.176 --> 01:00:09.855
known by the other wyrms.

01:00:09.855 --> 01:00:11.131
MARISHA: Sure.

01:00:11.131 --> 01:00:12.464
TALIESIN: Eventually, yes.

01:00:12.464 --> 01:00:16.782
LIAM: So if we kill that dragon, what do the other
dragons do in that moment, and are we ready to

01:00:16.782 --> 01:00:18.283
take on Thordak right now?

01:00:18.283 --> 01:00:20.183
SAM: No! We kill it and run.

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:24.088
LAURA: But we can't kill all of them at the same
time. It's got to be a one-by-one process.

01:00:24.088 --> 01:00:29.205
LIAM: Absolutely, but are we going to try to kill
the black and then go on a hunt for all these--

01:00:29.205 --> 01:00:32.592
MARISHA: There are going to be consequences to
this no matter what.

01:00:32.592 --> 01:00:34.293
TALIESIN: How big is the black dragon?

01:00:34.293 --> 01:00:39.446
MATT: From what you saw? Oh man.

01:00:39.446 --> 01:00:43.310
TRAVIS: Bigger than the blue, bigger than the
white?

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:46.492
MATT: It was bigger than the blue, about equal
size to the white.

01:00:46.492 --> 01:00:49.236
LAURA: The white one that we killed, or the white
one that we also saw?

01:00:49.236 --> 01:00:52.557
MATT: The one that you fought at the Keep--

01:00:52.557 --> 01:00:54.541
LAURA: Yeah, that one was real bad.

01:00:54.541 --> 01:00:56.453
TRAVIS: Where I rolled a 21 and it missed.

01:00:56.453 --> 01:01:09.785
MATT: Yeah, it was, I'd say from height size of
standing on its legs, probably, I dunno, 30 to 40

01:01:09.785 --> 01:01:11.556
feet tall?

01:01:11.556 --> 01:01:17.144
MARISHA: We've never fought like a full realized
dragon, correct?

01:01:17.144 --> 01:01:18.719
MATT: You've fought them.

01:01:18.719 --> 01:01:21.485
LIAM: We've run from them.

01:01:21.485 --> 01:01:27.036
TRAVIS: Yeah, remember 21 missed. I can't believe
I'm saying this--

01:01:27.036 --> 01:01:31.738
LAURA: Yeah, but all those guys, they were, I
mean. They had strong attacks.

01:01:31.738 --> 01:01:36.444
TRAVIS: Right, but there might be some that can
hit him when he's in the air, but not all of them.

01:01:36.444 --> 01:01:42.250
TALIESIN: If I-- if I had time I could build a
machine that might be able to trap him on the

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:44.316
ground for at least a little while.

01:01:44.316 --> 01:01:49.142
TRAVIS: Yeah, if you had time. Why are we being in
such a rush about this?

01:01:49.142 --> 01:01:54.800
SAM: Because we know where the dragon is, we have
an army, we have an opportunity, this is it. We're

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.398
never going to have an army.

01:01:56.398 --> 01:02:00.779
TALIESIN: I think-- I disagree with that, I think
we'll absolutely have opportunities to have an

01:02:00.779 --> 01:02:07.434
army. And I think that if we call upon the Herd
later for something like this, maybe we can get

01:02:07.434 --> 01:02:09.991
them-- I don't know.

01:02:09.991 --> 01:02:11.867
ASHLEY: How much time are you thinking?

01:02:11.867 --> 01:02:13.978
TALIESIN: As much time as it takes.

01:02:13.978 --> 01:02:17.179
MARISHA: You can't build a machine like that in
under, what, a few weeks?

01:02:17.179 --> 01:02:21.631
SAM: And what if the machine fails? We need a plan
that doesn't rely on technology, I'm sorry.

01:02:21.631 --> 01:02:26.839
LAURA: What if we put out the loot, let him come
down and get it, and then we throw big ropes up

01:02:26.839 --> 01:02:28.517
and over him or something?

01:02:28.517 --> 01:02:34.041
MARISHA: I feel like between Pike and Scanlan and
I-- Well, look, I feel like between Pike, Scanlan,

01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:39.652
and I and Percy with his mechanical genius, we can
figure something amongst the spells that we know

01:02:39.652 --> 01:02:42.060
to make a viable trap.

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:46.422
SAM: If we have 40 goliaths throw 40 chains
attached to--

01:02:46.422 --> 01:02:47.966
TRAVIS: They're not all goliaths.

01:02:47.966 --> 01:02:55.737
SAM: Fine. 30 goliaths would throw 30 chains with
30 spikes on them at this dragon, I bet a few would hit.

01:02:55.737 --> 01:02:59.423
ASHLEY: I could throw up a Blade Barrier on top of
him.

01:02:59.423 --> 01:03:04.124
SAM: Yes, we are super powerful. They're strong,
we're smart, let's do this.

01:03:04.124 --> 01:03:10.474
LIAM: If we kill it now, we're going to have to
be-- if we kill it now, all the others are going

01:03:10.474 --> 01:03:15.919
to punish the people they're sitting upon, and
we're not ready to go dragon to dragon to dragon

01:03:15.919 --> 01:03:17.026
like that.

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:21.169
LAURA: Will they? Dragons are vain, how do you
know they won't just find that dragon weak and

01:03:21.169 --> 01:03:23.268
think that he's not worthy of them--

01:03:23.268 --> 01:03:26.525
LIAM: They're going to know that something
challenged his power and there are going to be

01:03:26.525 --> 01:03:30.200
consequences for it, they'll make a display of
their strength.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:34.031
MARISHA: I have a feeling they were very upset
when we killed the blue one.

01:03:34.031 --> 01:03:36.952
SAM: So what, we're never going to kill any of the
dragons, then? Because that will happen at some point.

01:03:36.952 --> 01:03:38.873
LIAM: We will. We will. It's--

01:03:38.873 --> 01:03:44.783
SAM: And they won't react then? It's-- this is our
mission, to kill these dragons.

01:03:44.783 --> 01:03:48.173
MARISHA: Once again, there's going to be
consequences no matter what we do.

01:03:48.173 --> 01:03:54.074
MATT: At this point, you guys have, as you hit the
end of your sentence, Percy, you all look up and

01:03:54.074 --> 01:03:59.683
you all see the two-story building with a dark red
brick contrasting against Wilhand's home, it's a

01:03:59.683 --> 01:04:08.878
deep-set heavy brick with dark wood siding to it,
and it looks like dark marble finishes certain

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:12.571
elements of the base of it, it matches the
description that was given to you by Quall.

01:04:12.571 --> 01:04:14.460
LAURA: Does it look like it's been ransacked at
all?

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:18.220
MATT: It looks like the door is partially ajar.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.964
MARISHA: Partially ajar?

01:04:19.964 --> 01:04:23.566
TALIESIN: Why don't we see how our favor holds?
Let's take a moment.

01:04:23.566 --> 01:04:27.148
SAM: All right. If we find something cool, we kill
the dragon.

01:04:27.148 --> 01:04:31.042
MARISHA: Oh, we're leaving this up to a coin flip,
now?

01:04:31.042 --> 01:04:34.415
TRAVIS: 20 or a one, seems to work well for us.

01:04:34.415 --> 01:04:35.907
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:04:35.907 --> 01:04:38.700
TALIESIN: I'm curious what the fates would say.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:43.424
MARISHA: (sighs) I don't give a shit what the
fates have to say.

01:04:43.424 --> 01:04:46.085
LAURA: I do have a coin with a 20 and a one on
it.

01:04:46.085 --> 01:04:51.016
MATT: All right. So what's the plan?

01:04:51.016 --> 01:04:57.619
LAURA: Are we going-- Silently, quietly walking up
to the front door?

01:04:57.619 --> 01:05:00.324
TALIESIN: Vax, if you would be so kind?

01:05:00.324 --> 01:05:01.736
LAURA: It's already partially ajar.

01:05:01.736 --> 01:05:03.535
ASHLEY: Should we check it for traps first?

01:05:03.535 --> 01:05:04.686
TALIESIN: Check for traps.

01:05:04.686 --> 01:05:06.739
MATT: All right, if you want to make an
investigation check.

01:05:06.739 --> 01:05:14.117
LIAM: Investigation, or is it-- perception is
normally what I've done for traps, isn't it?

01:05:14.117 --> 01:05:17.323
MATT: Investigation's for traps, perception is to
notice how to disarm it.

01:05:17.323 --> 01:05:20.597
LIAM: All right. 27.

01:05:20.597 --> 01:05:26.357
MATT: 27. You approach the front door, doesn't
appear to be trapped, you open partly the door and

01:05:26.357 --> 01:05:32.546
the interior, fireplace is still going, and you
see the crackle in the distance, fine furniture

01:05:32.546 --> 01:05:38.415
set up. There is the body of a goliath face-down
on the ground about five feet from the front door,

01:05:38.415 --> 01:05:41.868
head splattered across the ground.

01:05:41.868 --> 01:05:43.326
LIAM: Oh, he's dead.

01:05:43.326 --> 01:05:50.011
MATT: You also look around the circumstances, and
you glance upward to where his head would be, and

01:05:50.011 --> 01:05:54.825
amongst all these stone tiles in the ceiling,
there's one that's set slightly lower than the

01:05:54.825 --> 01:05:56.870
rest, right above where that splatter occurred.

01:05:56.870 --> 01:06:00.972
ALL: (whispers) Traps!

01:06:00.972 --> 01:06:03.129
TRAVIS: A warm fire! And I run-- no.

01:06:03.129 --> 01:06:06.169
(laughter)

01:06:06.169 --> 01:06:08.966
LIAM: (Grog voice) It's a little brave, running
around.

01:06:08.966 --> 01:06:11.680
TALIESIN: Well, this is exactly what I was hoping
for.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:16.984
LIAM: I need a minute, everybody. Everybody hang
back, just for a second.

01:06:16.984 --> 01:06:18.621
TRAVIS: Yeah, do you want me to hang outside?

01:06:18.621 --> 01:06:20.563
LIAM: Yeah, Vex'ahlia, could you come here?

01:06:20.563 --> 01:06:22.023
LAURA: Of course, brother.

01:06:22.023 --> 01:06:27.756
LIAM: Yeah. This is a death box, this room is a
death box. And I have a keen eye, but I wouldn't

01:06:27.756 --> 01:06:29.616
mind another set.

01:06:29.616 --> 01:06:31.130
LAURA: D'you want me to look around?

01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:32.645
LIAM: I'd like us both to look around.

01:06:32.645 --> 01:06:33.777
LAURA: From out here?

01:06:33.777 --> 01:06:35.167
LIAM: No, I said come inside.

01:06:35.167 --> 01:06:36.320
LAURA: I can actually walk in?

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.128
LIAM: Yeah.

01:06:37.128 --> 01:06:41.671
LAURA: All right. I stand exactly in front of the
door and don't take any more steps.

01:06:41.671 --> 01:06:46.215
LIAM: Come in. Aww, you're my bestie. All right,
I'm going to start looking around for traps.

01:06:46.215 --> 01:06:47.779
LAURA: I look for traps visually.

01:06:47.779 --> 01:06:51.463
MATT: Both of you guys make investigation checks
as you slowly move forward at a slow pace.

01:06:51.463 --> 01:06:53.698
SAM: Can I assist you guys?

01:06:53.698 --> 01:06:58.615
LIAM: Well, you know, your music does calm and
soothe me--

01:06:58.615 --> 01:07:04.026
SAM: Not with music, I'll send an invisible guy in
there to start pressing on the floor and walls.

01:07:04.026 --> 01:07:08.011
LAURA: Oh, well, give us just a moment. Yeah, but
that's a good idea. 24.

01:07:08.011 --> 01:07:09.222
LIAM: 24.

01:07:09.222 --> 01:07:12.637
MATT: Okay. The two of you guys scoot forward, and
you find there are four different pillars in the

01:07:12.637 --> 01:07:21.426
ceiling that are arranged in a similar way. They
are triggered by a little bit of pressure, and you

01:07:21.426 --> 01:07:25.549
see there's a rug that oversets it, you can see
the slight variations in the texture of the ground

01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:29.802
where the actual trigger plates are. You get the
sensation that this house was going to be

01:07:29.802 --> 01:07:34.415
ransacked, and then the troop that came in, one of
them went (crushing noise) and they went nooope

01:07:34.415 --> 01:07:35.753
and backed out of the house.

01:07:35.753 --> 01:07:37.347
(laughter)

01:07:37.347 --> 01:07:42.829
MATT: You eventually find your way across this
area, marking quietly with an arrow or scraping

01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:47.225
the carpet where each one of these places are, but
you make your way across the room to a staircase

01:07:47.225 --> 01:07:48.932
that leads up, staircase that leads down.

01:07:48.932 --> 01:07:58.056
LIAM: Bullshit, bullshit, lotta bullshit. All
right, guys, I think it's safe to come into the

01:07:58.056 --> 01:08:04.275
first room. So you said, because I was being a
jackass and saying bullshit, what was the

01:08:04.275 --> 01:08:05.826
description you just gave?

01:08:05.826 --> 01:08:07.202
LAURA: There's stairs, we're at the bottom of the
stairs.

01:08:07.202 --> 01:08:10.205
MATT: Yeah, there's the main living area that has
the fireplace, and then stairs that go up and

01:08:10.205 --> 01:08:11.558
stairs that go down.

01:08:11.558 --> 01:08:13.719
LAURA: Are there doors in this main-- it's like a
foyer?

01:08:13.719 --> 01:08:17.130
MATT: It's like a giant foyer area, there's an
area that passes behind the stairs, something that

01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:19.365
would go into a kitchen area, like a dining room
kitchen.

01:08:19.365 --> 01:08:21.327
LIAM: Let's not split up, let's do this together.

01:08:21.327 --> 01:08:25.433
TALIESIN: He's rich and paranoid, so if anything
is of value it'll be downstairs, so I say we do

01:08:25.433 --> 01:08:26.633
upstairs first.

01:08:26.633 --> 01:08:27.710
LAURA: All right.

01:08:27.710 --> 01:08:29.932
MATT: Does Trinket wait outside, or is Trinket
following you?

01:08:29.932 --> 01:08:38.730
LAURA: Ohh. Trinket, dear? Come on, come on, d'you
want to go in the locket? You do? If you don't,

01:08:38.730 --> 01:08:41.868
you can wait out here but it's probably safer in
the locket.

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:44.361
MATT: (disgruntled bear noises) Lumbers forward,
gives you a look like--

01:08:44.361 --> 01:08:47.427
LAURA: Don't be sad about it, if you don't want
to, I'm not going to make you.

01:08:47.427 --> 01:08:52.251
MATT: Trinket's pulled into the amulet.

01:08:52.251 --> 01:08:55.080
LAURA: Ooh, I love him so much.

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.614
MATT: Amulet which you've now been in.

01:08:57.614 --> 01:08:59.565
LAURA: What was it like, Grog?

01:08:59.565 --> 01:09:05.818
TRAVIS: I left a little something in there for
him. Time doesn't pass, right? Does time pass in

01:09:05.818 --> 01:09:06.973
the locket?

01:09:06.973 --> 01:09:08.482
MATT: You don't know.

01:09:08.482 --> 01:09:10.317
TRAVIS: Well, I farted right before I hopped out.

01:09:10.317 --> 01:09:12.736
(laughter)

01:09:12.736 --> 01:09:14.790
LIAM: Like a nintendo cartridge.

01:09:14.790 --> 01:09:17.967
ASHLEY: (fart noise) Raaaah! Goosh.

01:09:17.967 --> 01:09:20.566
TRAVIS: I might not live past this. (fart noise)

01:09:20.566 --> 01:09:22.742
(laughter)

01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:24.384
MATT: Got to leave your mark.

01:09:24.384 --> 01:09:29.755
LAURA: Can we check out the stairs and make sure
nothing's wrong with the stairs?

01:09:29.755 --> 01:09:31.947
MATT: Yeah. Go ahead and make an investigation
check.

01:09:31.947 --> 01:09:34.921
LAURA: Oh, I did not see anything.

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:36.567
LIAM: I'm fine. I got a 20.

01:09:36.567 --> 01:09:48.135
MATT: Okay. The stairs-- As you begin to inspect,
you reach out and take the railing and take the

01:09:48.135 --> 01:09:50.767
first step and your foot passes through the
stair.

01:09:50.767 --> 01:09:55.520
LIAM: Ooh, that's not solid. At all. Look, put
your foot through that.

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.873
LAURA: I'm going to stand here and watch you do
it, actually.

01:09:57.873 --> 01:10:04.134
LIAM: I'm going to get down on my knees and stick
my head through the stairs--

01:10:04.134 --> 01:10:06.225
LAURA: Oh, what? Are you fucking kidding me right
now?

01:10:06.225 --> 01:10:10.784
MATT: You go to try and stop him as he pushes his
head through the step.

01:10:10.784 --> 01:10:12.101
LAURA: You're a moron!

01:10:12.101 --> 01:10:13.369
LIAM: I know!

01:10:13.369 --> 01:10:16.922
MATT: You pass through this illusory staircase,
and you look up and you can see the bottom half of

01:10:16.922 --> 01:10:25.095
the staircase. This area is a slide that descends
into darkness. You having your darkvision can see

01:10:25.095 --> 01:10:30.224
that the slide descends into a now-cold furnace.

01:10:30.224 --> 01:10:34.560
LAURA: D'you want to get your whole body in
there?

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.567
LIAM: But can I see-- I pull my head up, what can
I see at the top of the stairs, is there a landing?

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:45.061
MATT: No, you look up and if you, from where the
illusion is the illusory stairs stop at a ceiling,

01:10:45.061 --> 01:10:49.677
a stone ceiling that leads down, you can't look
past it, looking up you can see a landing and a

01:10:49.677 --> 01:10:50.977
secondary floor.

01:10:50.977 --> 01:10:54.049
LIAM: Okay. Is there any stray furniture around?

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:58.366
MATT: Yeah, there's precariously placed--

01:10:58.366 --> 01:11:00.222
LIAM: Are there any shitty pillows or anything?

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:02.472
MATT: Yeah, there's like a couple throw pillows on
the couch that are by the--

01:11:02.472 --> 01:11:03.879
LAURA: What are shitty pillows?

01:11:03.879 --> 01:11:09.364
LIAM: I totally ignore my sister, which is what
I've done half my entire life, and I stick my head

01:11:09.364 --> 01:11:11.308
down and I let it go and watch it go down the
slide.

01:11:11.308 --> 01:11:14.870
LAURA: Was that fun? Was that fu--

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:19.744
MATT: (roar-of-fire sound) You guys watch as a jet
of flame jettisons out from the staircase.

01:11:19.744 --> 01:11:21.340
(laughter)

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:27.577
MATT: Singes the top of the roof area, where
there's a bunch of wood, but the wood is not

01:11:27.577 --> 01:11:30.042
burned or charred and the flames die down again.

01:11:30.042 --> 01:11:35.269
LIAM: Hey, y'know, it wasn't fun, but it was
educational, shithead. And I walk over and stop at

01:11:35.269 --> 01:11:37.745
the edge of the stairs going down, you said there
were stairs going down?

01:11:37.745 --> 01:11:39.424
MARISHA: Who the fuck is this guy?

01:11:39.424 --> 01:11:40.827
TALIESIN: I don't know, I certainly like him.

01:11:40.827 --> 01:11:43.162
LIAM: Same thing, I want to see-- could you help
me over here?

01:11:43.162 --> 01:11:45.123
LAURA: I'm looking, I'm checking out those stairs
too.

01:11:45.123 --> 01:11:46.414
LIAM: Wise-arse.

01:11:46.414 --> 01:11:50.919
LAURA: I wouldn't have slid down the fucking
slide, I would assume that leads to death. I don't

01:11:50.919 --> 01:11:54.167
need to throw a pillow down the slide to know--

01:11:54.167 --> 01:11:59.171
LIAM: You are very smart and wise. You know, we
could be dead tomorrow, do you want to keep

01:11:59.171 --> 01:12:00.951
arguing with me like this?

01:12:00.951 --> 01:12:04.063
LAURA: No. 21.

01:12:04.063 --> 01:12:06.635
LIAM: Yeah, I got higher than that. 26.

01:12:06.635 --> 01:12:07.974
LAURA: Dick.

01:12:07.974 --> 01:12:10.112
(laughter)

01:12:10.112 --> 01:12:11.868
TALIESIN: I could watch this all day.

01:12:11.868 --> 01:12:18.471
MATT: The staircase descends, solid stairs.
Partway down, you do see a slight carving in the

01:12:18.471 --> 01:12:25.080
stone, a glyph of some kind that is faintly hidden
with dust and dirt placed to fill the gap. There

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:29.729
is some sort of a symbol ever-so-faintly hidden in
the stone halfway down.

01:12:29.729 --> 01:12:31.076
LAURA: Can we read it? Do we understand it?

01:12:31.076 --> 01:12:37.828
LIAM: D'you know, the last time I saw something
like that, the carpet was fucked. Do you think

01:12:37.828 --> 01:12:39.871
Wilhand would have any idea--?

01:12:39.871 --> 01:12:41.267
LAURA: &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; carpet?

01:12:41.267 --> 01:12:43.006
LIAM: Yeah, the-- no, the other carpet.

01:12:43.006 --> 01:12:48.411
LAURA: Maybe Scanlan has an idea what it is.
Scanlan!

01:12:48.411 --> 01:12:49.462
SAM: Oi!

01:12:49.462 --> 01:12:51.065
LAURA: You know this rune over here?

01:12:51.065 --> 01:12:53.520
SAM: This-- what? I don't even see what you're
talking about.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:56.368
LAURA: This little glowy rune right here. Look
closely.

01:12:56.368 --> 01:12:59.569
SAM: Oh! I would've totally missed that.

01:12:59.569 --> 01:13:01.223
(laughter)

01:13:01.223 --> 01:13:06.282
SAM: I think that I have not seen anything like
this before, but have I?

01:13:06.282 --> 01:13:08.317
MATT: Make an arcana check.

01:13:08.317 --> 01:13:11.218
SAM: 13.

01:13:11.218 --> 01:13:19.741
MATT: It appears to be magical in nature. The
symbols elude you, their construct, the arcane

01:13:19.741 --> 01:13:25.259
equation that is based around this, you can't tell
if it's still functional or not, but it is magical

01:13:25.259 --> 01:13:26.623
in its construction.

01:13:26.623 --> 01:13:29.085
SAM: Want to throw a pillow down there?

01:13:29.085 --> 01:13:31.318
LIAM: What an interesting idea.

01:13:31.318 --> 01:13:33.228
LAURA: I go get a pillow and I throw it at the
rune.

01:13:33.228 --> 01:13:34.666
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

01:13:34.666 --> 01:13:36.690
LAURA: How'd it work, does that, is that how
you're supposed to do it?

01:13:36.690 --> 01:13:39.126
MATT: The pillow-- (impact) down the stairs.

01:13:39.126 --> 01:13:40.782
LIAM: Yeah, you did it wrong, see, nothing
happened.

01:13:40.782 --> 01:13:42.343
(laughter)

01:13:42.343 --> 01:13:44.100
SAM: Well, go get the pillow, try again.

01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:48.413
MARISHA: Try a lumbar. Maybe a different result.

01:13:48.413 --> 01:13:54.155
LAURA: So wait wait wait, the last time you saw
runes like this, you lost the carpet. How did you

01:13:54.155 --> 01:13:55.518
lose the carpet?

01:13:55.518 --> 01:14:04.599
LIAM: Well, so, did we never talk about that?
Yeah. A bunch of us were riding it-- Ah, it was

01:14:04.599 --> 01:14:08.885
the dwarf, I swear it was the dwarf. We were on
the carpet and there were runes on the walls and

01:14:08.885 --> 01:14:12.977
as soon as we got near the runes the carpet went
(raspberry noise) and fell down.

01:14:12.977 --> 01:14:15.649
LAURA: So it might disenchant whatever we have on
us.

01:14:15.649 --> 01:14:20.104
LIAM: Well, it could do that, it could also-- I
don't know anything about magic, but I assume it

01:14:20.104 --> 01:14:21.342
could burn us.

01:14:21.342 --> 01:14:23.672
LAURA: Well, how do we make it not burn us?

01:14:23.672 --> 01:14:28.673
LIAM: Well. (sighs) I mean. Hey, Shorty, you're
our best bet here, I don't know anything about

01:14:28.673 --> 01:14:29.617
this shit.

01:14:29.617 --> 01:14:30.877
LAURA: Who can undo magical thingies?

01:14:30.877 --> 01:14:32.225
SAM: Not me, Pikey! Pike?

01:14:32.225 --> 01:14:34.954
Pike, you got any undo magicky things?

01:14:34.954 --> 01:14:36.763
MATT: This would be a Dispel Magic spell, for the
record.

01:14:36.763 --> 01:14:38.608
ASHLEY: Yeah, I have Dispel Magic.

01:14:38.608 --> 01:14:39.722
MATT: You have it prepared?

01:14:39.722 --> 01:14:40.752
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:14:40.752 --> 01:14:42.317
MATT: Then yeah, you could give it a shot.

01:14:42.317 --> 01:14:43.795
SAM: You're my girl!

01:14:43.795 --> 01:14:45.603
TALIESIN: I could try my Dispel Magic ability.

01:14:45.603 --> 01:14:47.303
LIAM: What's that one?

01:14:47.303 --> 01:14:51.301
TALIESIN: It's called a bullet. I'll shoot it
until it doesn't work anymore.

01:14:51.301 --> 01:15:00.278
MATT: All righty. So. Pike. So as you step
forward, they point out this glyph on the wall.

01:15:00.278 --> 01:15:06.626
You're going to cast Dispel Magic on it, I need
you to go ahead and roll a d20 and add your

01:15:06.626 --> 01:15:08.953
spellcasting ability modifier, which--

01:15:08.953 --> 01:15:11.105
LAURA: Whoa! Oh, what is it, what was it?

01:15:11.105 --> 01:15:12.719
LIAM: It's a 20 on the floor!

01:15:12.719 --> 01:15:14.407
LAURA: If it was bad it doesn't count, but if it's
good it does.

01:15:14.407 --> 01:15:16.685
MATT: That doesn't count. Roll it intentionally.

01:15:16.685 --> 01:15:18.016
LIAM: Good, because it's not that good.

01:15:18.016 --> 01:15:25.287
MATT: So, your wisdom modifier is actually a five,
because she forgot to add her level 12 bonus we

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:30.149
discovered recently. So it's now a 20, plus five
on the roll. So go ahead and roll a d20, add five.

01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:34.135
ASHLEY: All right. 18.

01:15:34.135 --> 01:15:40.641
MATT: 18. As you reach up and grab your symbol of
Sarenrae, you focus for a second and there is a

01:15:40.641 --> 01:15:47.244
flash, like a flashbulb. As it flashes, the glyph
glows for a second, and then you hear what sounds

01:15:47.244 --> 01:15:54.353
like a cracking sound. And this glowing energy
seems to shatter, almost like glass made of

01:15:54.353 --> 01:15:59.300
energy. As the energy fades and falls out of the
glyph, it hits the ground and it dissipates into a

01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:01.089
light mist that then vanishes.

01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:03.140
LAURA: Good job, Pike!

01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:04.600
ASHLEY: I think it's dispelled?

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:05.953
SAM: I think so.

01:16:05.953 --> 01:16:07.150
LIAM: Good job, Pike.

01:16:07.150 --> 01:16:10.250
ASHLEY: Thanks, Vax.

01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:12.960
MARISHA: We're going up, right? Up or down?

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.345
TALIESIN: There were stairs, there was no up.

01:16:14.345 --> 01:16:18.215
LIAM: You don't want to go up, there's no up. Up
is ouchie.

01:16:18.215 --> 01:16:21.801
LAURA: I thought we could skip over that one step
and then there was up.

01:16:21.801 --> 01:16:29.830
MATT: The stairs from underneath go all the way up
to underneath the point, you haven't attempted to

01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:31.547
go over if you wanted to, it's up to you.

01:16:31.547 --> 01:16:33.726
LAURA: Yeah! Yeah, we can jump over that little
gap.

01:16:33.726 --> 01:16:35.277
LIAM: Oh, I thought you said it went to the
ceiling.

01:16:35.277 --> 01:16:40.862
MATT: I mean, the stair illusion is the entire
staircase. But you haven't-- you don't see what's

01:16:40.862 --> 01:16:41.996
on the actual landing.

01:16:41.996 --> 01:16:43.396
MARISHA: You've got the fancy broom.

01:16:43.396 --> 01:16:44.876
LIAM: You got the fancy broom, exactly.

01:16:44.876 --> 01:16:49.901
LAURA: Hmm, all right, I get on the broom and I
float on up to that landing and I look and see if

01:16:49.901 --> 01:16:52.019
there's any traps on the ground. Without setting
foot on it!

01:16:52.019 --> 01:16:57.108
LIAM: I've seen you take other people, can I hang
off the bottom of that thing? Can you carry me up?

01:16:57.108 --> 01:17:00.123
LAURA: I don't know, you're pretty heavy. You
might fit--

01:17:00.123 --> 01:17:01.613
LIAM: I'm lighter than you!

01:17:01.613 --> 01:17:05.950
LAURA: (gasps) It's nothing to brag about,
scrawny.

01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:08.540
LIAM: Look at my constitution, it's very low.

01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:12.063
LAURA: Minus two! I am equally scrawny.

01:17:12.063 --> 01:17:14.200
(laughter)

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:16.457
TALIESIN: We're learning so much tonight! God!

01:17:16.457 --> 01:17:18.893
LAURA: Dangle well onto the bottom, you can hang
off the bottom of it.

01:17:18.893 --> 01:17:21.014
MARISHA: You guys were born at the same time,
you're both scrawny.

01:17:21.014 --> 01:17:27.715
SAM: If you're going to do this, I insist that we
visually see it with the actual broom.

01:17:27.715 --> 01:17:30.364
(laughter)

01:17:30.364 --> 01:17:32.861
MARISHA: Yes. I second this.

01:17:32.861 --> 01:17:39.920
MATT: So. You get onto the broom, bring yourself
to rise up, speaking the keyword, which is--

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.539
LAURA: (spitting sound)

01:17:41.539 --> 01:17:42.858
MATT: There you go.

01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:44.760
(laughter)

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:47.409
MATT: As you begin to drift up, Vax, you go ahead
and grab onto it.

01:17:47.409 --> 01:17:49.164
LIAM: This is stupid!

01:17:49.164 --> 01:17:54.107
MATT: As your weight is lifted by the broom, your
feet actually fall through the illusion itself.

01:17:54.107 --> 01:17:56.673
LAURA: Don't. Fucking. Let go.

01:17:56.673 --> 01:17:59.874
MATT: So you guys watch as the lower half of his
body vanishes against the stairs as he passes

01:17:59.874 --> 01:18:01.192
through it.

01:18:01.192 --> 01:18:03.561
LIAM: (grunts) I'm checking for traps!

01:18:03.561 --> 01:18:05.449
MARISHA: Why is Vax holding on?

01:18:05.449 --> 01:18:07.427
TALIESIN: They're working things out, just let it
happen.

01:18:07.427 --> 01:18:11.650
LIAM: This is a family thing, please keep out!

01:18:11.650 --> 01:18:13.759
(laughter)

01:18:13.759 --> 01:18:19.477
MATT: You make your way up to the secondary floor.
Dark up here, you see there are two rooms. Both

01:18:19.477 --> 01:18:27.759
doors are open. The one to the right appears to be
some sort of a desk, study, bookshelves, but all

01:18:27.759 --> 01:18:34.124
the books are gone. The desk appears to be cleaned
out. Actually, all the drawers are open and there

01:18:34.124 --> 01:18:39.660
are a couple of haphazard writing utensils that
have dropped on the floor, but it looks like Quall

01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:44.058
was trying to leave in a hurry, grabbed most of
what was important to him. Except for one thing,

01:18:44.058 --> 01:18:46.310
which is what he sent you here to get.

01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:51.805
MARISHA: I was going to be like: look for the
circlet!

01:18:51.805 --> 01:18:53.097
LAURA: Obviously!

01:18:53.097 --> 01:18:55.336
MARISHA: Just a reminder.

01:18:55.336 --> 01:18:56.478
LIAM: Thank you.

01:18:56.478 --> 01:19:03.647
MATT: The other one appears to be a bedroom, there
appears to be a garish canopy bed with like spiral

01:19:03.647 --> 01:19:06.239
edges, with like little gold-leaf imprints into
it--

01:19:06.239 --> 01:19:15.492
LAURA: Ooh, Master Quall was a little freaky I
think. Can we look under the bed?

01:19:15.492 --> 01:19:18.211
LAURA: Traps, traps, under the bed. I want to look
under the bed.

01:19:18.211 --> 01:19:20.421
LIAM: Under the bed, in the bed, around the bed.

01:19:20.421 --> 01:19:23.535
LAURA: 17?

01:19:23.535 --> 01:19:26.193
LIAM: 23.

01:19:26.193 --> 01:19:29.284
MATT: Okay. This room does not appear to be
trapped.

01:19:29.284 --> 01:19:30.979
LAURA: Can I look under the bed?

01:19:30.979 --> 01:19:36.514
MATT: You look under the bed. Under the bed there
is a small chest that is pushed to the very back,

01:19:36.514 --> 01:19:37.837
you pull it out, shhk.

01:19:37.837 --> 01:19:39.486
LAURA: I check for traps on the chest.

01:19:39.486 --> 01:19:41.327
LIAM: I take three steps back away from my
sister.

01:19:41.327 --> 01:19:42.703
TRAVIS: You've made her very cautious.

01:19:42.703 --> 01:19:46.242
MATT: I, as it tends to. Go ahead and make an
investigation check now.

01:19:46.242 --> 01:19:51.870
LAURA: 26.

01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:54.379
MATT: 26. The chest does not appear to be
trapped.

01:19:54.379 --> 01:19:55.526
SAM: Ooh, good!

01:19:55.526 --> 01:19:56.717
LAURA: I try to open it.

01:19:56.717 --> 01:19:57.682
MATT: It is locked.

01:19:57.682 --> 01:19:59.922
LAURA: It's locked, it's locked, open it. Open
it.

01:19:59.922 --> 01:20:02.217
LIAM: You're so good at all my tricks, are you
sure?

01:20:02.217 --> 01:20:04.658
LAURA: Do you want me to try to pick this lock?

01:20:04.658 --> 01:20:07.315
Because I am very talented as a rogue.

01:20:07.315 --> 01:20:10.858
LIAM: You are extremely talented and you're going
to get better and better every day.

01:20:10.858 --> 01:20:12.268
LAURA: Well then fine, I'll try to unlock it.

01:20:12.268 --> 01:20:14.522
LIAM: All right. I take five more steps backward.

01:20:14.522 --> 01:20:17.079
(laughter)

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:20.505
MATT: Okay. So you go ahead and take out your
lockpick.

01:20:20.505 --> 01:20:22.552
LAURA: Is this how you hold it? This is how you
hold it, then?

01:20:22.552 --> 01:20:24.403
LIAM: Hey man, I don't want to harsh your mellow.

01:20:24.403 --> 01:20:34.019
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d20, add your dex and
your proficiency bonus, you're proficient in the tools.

01:20:34.019 --> 01:20:41.936
LAURA: 24. 24. Is that saving throws or regular?
Okay, yeah, 24.

01:20:41.936 --> 01:20:45.033
MATT: (click) The lock is open.

01:20:45.033 --> 01:20:46.390
LAURA: Hey, look at that!

01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:47.843
LIAM: Good job, that's a good job.

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:50.120
LAURA: Thank you. All the gold, all the gold.

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:59.591
MATT: Open it. There's a handful of copper. Looks
like the other thing that was within this chest

01:20:59.591 --> 01:21:01.667
was also taken by Quall on his way out.

01:21:01.667 --> 01:21:04.560
LAURA: Ugh. Why would he take the shit out and
then lock it and put it back under the bed?

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:05.934
What a douche.

01:21:05.934 --> 01:21:11.318
LIAM: And aside from traps, is there any like,
paintings with eyeholes cut in it for peeking or

01:21:11.318 --> 01:21:13.951
little holes in the wall?

01:21:13.951 --> 01:21:15.572
TALIESIN: Check the chest.

01:21:15.572 --> 01:21:18.158
LIAM: What, Percy?

01:21:18.158 --> 01:21:19.569
TALIESIN: Check the chest.

01:21:19.569 --> 01:21:22.627
LIAM: Does it have a false bottom? The chest.

01:21:22.627 --> 01:21:24.759
MATT: It does.

01:21:24.759 --> 01:21:27.611
(cheering)

01:21:27.611 --> 01:21:30.553
LIAM: C'mon, don't leave me hanging, what the
hell!

01:21:30.553 --> 01:21:33.794
MATT: You move some of the copper out of the way,
and you feel for it, as you push on one corner,

01:21:33.794 --> 01:21:39.699
the floor of the actual chest shifts a little bit.
You lift it up and--

01:21:39.699 --> 01:21:44.209
LIAM: You've always got to check it for a false
bottom.

01:21:44.209 --> 01:21:45.464
LAURA: I did, I did, I checked!

01:21:45.464 --> 01:21:46.456
LIAM: You didn't say shit!

01:21:46.456 --> 01:21:49.076
LAURA: I was saying it, I said I'm checking all
around the fucking chest, that's what I said!

01:21:49.076 --> 01:21:51.438
LIAM: Hmmm, I didn't hear the words 'false bottom'
out loud.

01:21:51.438 --> 01:21:52.980
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:58.618
MATT: At the bottom of this you see a key. A
single brass-colored key.

01:21:58.618 --> 01:21:59.717
LAURA: It's a key.

01:21:59.717 --> 01:22:01.401
LIAM: That's right, you're smart.

01:22:01.401 --> 01:22:06.860
LAURA: You know what? We're going to get
downstairs and this key is going to unlock the

01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:08.893
thing that has the circlet, I know it.

01:22:08.893 --> 01:22:10.712
LIAM: I think you're right. You know what else?

01:22:10.712 --> 01:22:11.749
LAURA: What?

01:22:11.749 --> 01:22:13.306
LIAM: We don't need to argue like this.

01:22:13.306 --> 01:22:16.995
LAURA: I love you.

01:22:16.995 --> 01:22:18.092
LIAM: Yeah?

01:22:18.092 --> 01:22:19.137
LAURA: Yeah.

01:22:19.137 --> 01:22:21.029
LIAM: Why're you always busting my balls, then?

01:22:21.029 --> 01:22:22.273
LAURA: Because it's fun.

01:22:22.273 --> 01:22:24.556
LIAM: I'm sure it is, but y'know, getting hit in
the nuts hurts.

01:22:24.556 --> 01:22:29.579
TALIESIN: Double-check the bedroom for safes or
things behind paintings or maybe

01:22:29.579 --> 01:22:30.489
some sort of carpet--

01:22:30.489 --> 01:22:32.018
LAURA: I'm sorry, who's talking, who is this?

01:22:32.018 --> 01:22:34.254
TALIESIN: It's the voice of reason, coming from
downstairs.

01:22:34.254 --> 01:22:35.672
(laughter)

01:22:35.672 --> 01:22:37.416
LIAM: Is it, though? Is it really?

01:22:37.416 --> 01:22:40.648
TALIESIN: I know, I'm just as depressed that it is
as you are.

01:22:40.648 --> 01:22:44.375
LAURA: I double-check the room for-- What would
you like me to look for again?

01:22:44.375 --> 01:22:52.414
TALIESIN: Check paintings, behind the paintings,
check the bed for any odd slidey bits.

01:22:52.414 --> 01:22:55.697
MARISHA: Percy is a paranoid rich person, so he
knows things about them.

01:22:55.697 --> 01:22:57.702
TALIESIN: Trust paranoid rich people to know.

01:22:57.702 --> 01:23:01.552
MATT: Make a general investigation check
throughout the room as you search for any nooks

01:23:01.552 --> 01:23:03.497
and crannies, hidden spaces.

01:23:03.497 --> 01:23:04.830
LAURA: I rolled a one.

01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:07.727
LIAM: Well, investigation again? 20.

01:23:07.727 --> 01:23:12.672
MATT: Okay. You come to the conclusion that there
is nothing else to find in this room.

01:23:12.672 --> 01:23:14.797
LAURA: Nothing else to find, I found the key,
dammit.

01:23:14.797 --> 01:23:22.200
MATT: You look behind one of the paintings, and--
it's a wall behind it.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.158
(laughter)

01:23:24.158 --> 01:23:28.421
MATT: The room appears to be for the most part
cleaned out from your discovery here.

01:23:28.421 --> 01:23:31.269
LIAM: There was more than one room though, right?
You said--

01:23:31.269 --> 01:23:34.339
LAURA: Yeah, we checked all the rooms. We checked
the other room already.

01:23:34.339 --> 01:23:39.347
MATT: You checked the bedroom, now you looked
within the office study with a desk and all the

01:23:39.347 --> 01:23:42.645
drawers were left open and things have already
been taken from the room.

01:23:42.645 --> 01:23:45.563
LIAM: Okay, let's take that key downstairs. As you
said.

01:23:45.563 --> 01:23:47.160
LAURA: Hop on the broom.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:52.885
LIAM: I don't want to sit behind you, I'll hang
from it again. It's gross.

01:23:52.885 --> 01:23:55.797
LAURA: You can sit sidesaddle.

01:23:55.797 --> 01:23:59.697
MATT: You glide your way down, back to the main
floor. You guys are now at the top of the stairs

01:23:59.697 --> 01:24:01.745
leading into the basement, what're you going to
do?

01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:03.102
SAM: Let's go down to the basement!

01:24:03.102 --> 01:24:04.415
LAURA: Hey, I like this plan.

01:24:04.415 --> 01:24:06.284
LIAM: Oh, yeah. I'll go a little ways ahead.

01:24:06.284 --> 01:24:08.180
LAURA: (whispers) Look, Percy, I found a key!

01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:10.845
LIAM: Checking for traps. Past-- I'll go up to the
sigil.

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:14.503
MATT: So roll a dexterity saving throw.

01:24:14.503 --> 01:24:16.511
LIAM: Oh, shite.

01:24:16.511 --> 01:24:18.414
LAURA: What did you just do?

01:24:18.414 --> 01:24:22.342
LIAM: I don't know but I will have a high-- 23.

01:24:22.342 --> 01:24:27.025
MATT: Okay. As you step past the glyph, the wood
beneath your foot creaks and you instinctually

01:24:27.025 --> 01:24:29.711
leap forward, landing on your feet. Nothing
happens.

01:24:29.711 --> 01:24:31.266
(laughter)

01:24:31.266 --> 01:24:34.253
LIAM: I love you, Matt, so much.

01:24:34.253 --> 01:24:35.610
(laughter)

01:24:35.610 --> 01:24:42.031
LIAM: You just always have to be alert, you never
know, sometimes you think you know but you don't

01:24:42.031 --> 01:24:43.406
actually know!

01:24:43.406 --> 01:24:45.681
SAM: There was nothing there, Vax.

01:24:45.681 --> 01:24:47.065
LIAM: Now I know.

01:24:47.065 --> 01:24:50.342
MARISHA: The PTSD is really starting to sink in.

01:24:50.342 --> 01:24:51.899
LIAM: Three-point landing! Okay, we're fine!

01:24:51.899 --> 01:24:55.966
MARISHA: While they were up there dicking around,
we were looking around at the middle floor,

01:24:55.966 --> 01:24:57.285
anything good?

01:24:57.285 --> 01:25:00.809
SAM: No, we were not going anywhere near the
pressure points, by the way.

01:25:00.809 --> 01:25:03.964
MARISHA: Well, that is without being said.

01:25:03.964 --> 01:25:09.809
MATT: I mean, other than the rooms you guys went
into, there was the dining room area and the

01:25:09.809 --> 01:25:11.140
kitchen area.

01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:12.619
MARISHA: Anything good that looks--

01:25:12.619 --> 01:25:14.322
MATT: Investigation checks from both you guys.

01:25:14.322 --> 01:25:17.258
TALIESIN: I hate investigation checks.

01:25:17.258 --> 01:25:21.599
TALIESIN: 13.

01:25:21.599 --> 01:25:24.092
MARISHA: 19.

01:25:24.092 --> 01:25:28.929
MATT: Okay. Are you letting them wander and you're
staying where you are?

01:25:28.929 --> 01:25:33.303
SAM: I'm not going with them. No way, there are
terrible bombs and stuff there.

01:25:33.303 --> 01:25:39.157
MATT: All right. So, Keyleth, you wander through
the dining area towards the kitchen--

01:25:39.157 --> 01:25:40.775
MARISHA: Being very gentle.

01:25:40.775 --> 01:25:44.307
MATT: Percy, you scope around the other side,
checking around elements--

01:25:44.307 --> 01:25:46.045
TALIESIN: Not touching anything, just looking.

01:25:46.045 --> 01:25:52.482
MATT: Right. Nothing catches your attention
specifically. You get to the kitchen, the kitchen

01:25:52.482 --> 01:26:00.071
is cold, layer of dust. Doesn't appear to be
anything of particular interest in there.

01:26:00.071 --> 01:26:02.550
TALIESIN: Hm. All right.

01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:03.939
MARISHA: Okay.

01:26:03.939 --> 01:26:05.266
TALIESIN: Downstairs it is.

01:26:05.266 --> 01:26:07.863
LIAM: You know what, appreciate your rogues is all
I'm saying, am I right or am I right?

01:26:07.863 --> 01:26:13.993
MATT: So. You guys who wish to head down into the
basement--

01:26:13.993 --> 01:26:15.298
SAM: I'm going downstairs.

01:26:15.298 --> 01:26:17.678
MATT: Grog, you're still staying outside?

01:26:17.678 --> 01:26:21.059
TRAVIS: Yeah, actually, can Trinket and I walk to
the other side of the street?

01:26:21.059 --> 01:26:22.506
LAURA: Trinket's in my locket.

01:26:22.506 --> 01:26:24.110
TRAVIS: Can I walk to the other side of the
street?

01:26:24.110 --> 01:26:25.461
LAURA: But do you want Trinket with you?

01:26:25.461 --> 01:26:26.748
TRAVIS: No.

01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:28.849
MATT: Okay, so you walk to the other side of the
street on your own.

01:26:28.849 --> 01:26:31.304
TRAVIS: Yeah, and I watch the house from across
the street.

01:26:31.304 --> 01:26:33.117
LIAM: Stakeout.

01:26:33.117 --> 01:26:37.553
TRAVIS: Yeah, since this is taking a bit, it's not
a short rest is it, if I'm chilling?

01:26:37.553 --> 01:26:42.961
MATT: I mean, if you sit for like up to half an
hour or an hour rest, then yeah.

01:26:42.961 --> 01:26:44.379
TRAVIS: Nah, I'm just watching.

01:26:44.379 --> 01:26:49.805
MATT: Okay. All right, you guys make it down to
the basement area. This is a very, very small

01:26:49.805 --> 01:26:57.994
room, 20 by 20 feet, and there is a door, a big
heavy-ass metallic door that has--

01:26:57.994 --> 01:27:00.760
LIAM: --a keyhole?

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.824
MATT: A very specific keyhole, yes.

01:27:02.824 --> 01:27:07.244
LIAM: Wait wait wait wait-- Yes, yes we will, but
hold on, can I have a look at it? Can you have a

01:27:07.244 --> 01:27:09.246
look at it? We'll just take a look. And then you
do it.

01:27:09.246 --> 01:27:11.549
MARISHA: Aw, look, they're doing it together.

01:27:11.549 --> 01:27:12.979
TALIESIN: It's adorable, isn't it?

01:27:12.979 --> 01:27:15.410
LIAM: Shut up back there! It's easy to make
mistakes!

01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:20.273
LAURA: 25.

01:27:20.273 --> 01:27:22.004
LIAM: 20.

01:27:22.004 --> 01:27:31.618
MATT: There is some sort of an enchantment on the
door, and the keyhole area itself. You can't

01:27:31.618 --> 01:27:37.904
ascertain the nature of it, but as you approach
you can see that the metallic sheen shimmers

01:27:37.904 --> 01:27:42.130
without the light changing. There is something
about it that is unnatural.

01:27:42.130 --> 01:27:43.436
LIAM: Shit.

01:27:43.436 --> 01:27:49.067
LAURA: (whispers) Hey, Pike. Do you think you can
try dispelling magic again? Because there's some

01:27:49.067 --> 01:27:51.592
shimmery sort of shit on this door and I don't
trust it.

01:27:51.592 --> 01:27:54.200
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's really pretty, but lemme give
it a try.

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:56.327
MARISHA: It's iridescent!

01:27:56.327 --> 01:27:57.824
ASHLEY: Let's leave it, it's so pretty!

01:27:57.824 --> 01:28:00.558
SAM: Wait wait wait. Before you dispel the
magic--

01:28:00.558 --> 01:28:01.681
LAURA: What?

01:28:01.681 --> 01:28:05.931
SAM: Maybe it's good, maybe that's how the key
works? If you dispel the magic, maybe the key

01:28:05.931 --> 01:28:07.518
won't work anymore, I don't know.

01:28:07.518 --> 01:28:09.560
ASHLEY: I mean, that key was hidden for a reason.

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.726
SAM: Is there magic on the key?

01:28:11.726 --> 01:28:17.723
LAURA: If I stick it in and I turn it and it
explodes and I die, oh, I don't know, that's never

01:28:17.723 --> 01:28:18.965
happened before--

01:28:18.965 --> 01:28:21.081
SAM: Okay, dispel the magic, yeah, no that's
good.

01:28:21.081 --> 01:28:26.117
ASHLEY: I might need some extra help because I
only got a ten.

01:28:26.117 --> 01:28:31.622
SAM: Can I inspire her retroactively?

01:28:31.622 --> 01:28:32.961
MATT: Nope.

01:28:32.961 --> 01:28:39.771
As you mark off your second third-level
spell, releasing the Dispel Magic, the shimmer

01:28:39.771 --> 01:28:44.718
intensifies for a moment on the door and then
returns to its natural state.

01:28:44.718 --> 01:28:45.778
LAURA: Shit.

01:28:45.778 --> 01:28:47.308
SAM: I think it worked.

01:28:47.308 --> 01:28:50.999
TALIESIN: Do we have anybody who has Telekinesis?
Telekinesis of any kind?

01:28:50.999 --> 01:28:52.949
MARISHA: Telekinesis? No.

01:28:52.949 --> 01:28:57.918
SAM: Wait, I can have, I can have someone--

01:28:57.918 --> 01:28:59.335
LAURA: Oh, your invisible servant!

01:28:59.335 --> 01:29:01.720
SAM: I can have someone turn the key, if that's
what we're talking about.

01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:02.980
LAURA: Yeah, go do that!

01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:04.796
TALIESIN: Make someone expendable, it's a
brilliant idea.

01:29:04.796 --> 01:29:10.212
LAURA: Let's all step back, step way back. Back it
up, back it up.

01:29:10.212 --> 01:29:11.385
MARISHA: Wait wait wait.

01:29:11.385 --> 01:29:12.582
LAURA: What?

01:29:12.582 --> 01:29:16.000
MARISHA: What if it explodes the lock and then
we're not able to get in at all?

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.804
SAM: Then waah, we go kill a dragon instead.

01:29:17.804 --> 01:29:20.640
LIAM: Well. Sort of, yeah yeah yeah.

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:23.922
TALIESIN: Then at dawn, we talk about things.

01:29:23.922 --> 01:29:27.282
SAM: At dawn, we discuss!

01:29:27.282 --> 01:29:28.888
MARISHA: We plan!

01:29:28.888 --> 01:29:30.008
SAM: At dawn!

01:29:30.008 --> 01:29:33.132
TRAVIS: I already had my great moment, all right?

01:29:33.132 --> 01:29:36.883
MATT: So what're you doing, Scanlan?

01:29:36.883 --> 01:29:41.923
SAM: Can Unseen Servant carry a key, or is it more
Mage Hand-y?

01:29:41.923 --> 01:29:45.372
MATT: Yeah, I mean, a key's not-- Mage Hand can
even do five pounds on its own.

01:29:45.372 --> 01:29:50.219
SAM: I'll do Unseen Servant, named Mort.

01:29:50.219 --> 01:29:51.367
ALL: Mort.

01:29:51.367 --> 01:29:55.834
MATT: There's a slight shift of wind. And while
you guys see nothing after the wind fades, you

01:29:55.834 --> 01:29:57.342
know Mort is with you.

01:29:57.342 --> 01:30:01.379
LAURA: I'm holding the key up to Mort. I don't
know where he is.

01:30:01.379 --> 01:30:04.748
SAM: He's right in front of you! Don't be rude to
Mort!

01:30:04.748 --> 01:30:06.652
MATT: Nothing happens.

01:30:06.652 --> 01:30:09.801
SAM: Oh. Mort. Take the key.

01:30:09.801 --> 01:30:11.298
MATT: The key lifts out of your hand.

01:30:11.298 --> 01:30:14.017
TALIESIN: That's very unsettling.

01:30:14.017 --> 01:30:15.832
MATT: It's now in the middle of the air.

01:30:15.832 --> 01:30:17.731
TALIESIN: Okay, let's everyone back up.

01:30:17.731 --> 01:30:22.035
SAM: I have to wait six seconds. All right.

01:30:22.035 --> 01:30:31.096
MARISHA: I want to throw up a Gust cantrip in
front of us to help shield us if anything happens.

01:30:31.156 --> 01:30:36.695
MATT: A light breeze shimmers before you. What're
you going to do?

01:30:36.695 --> 01:30:40.584
SAM: Mort. Open the door with the key.

01:30:40.584 --> 01:30:48.018
MATT: The key drifts over, finds, turns, enters
the keyhole. Turns to the side. The metal around

01:30:48.018 --> 01:30:53.365
the keyhole begins to glow brighter and brighter
and brighter for a second. The outer rim of the

01:30:53.365 --> 01:30:57.901
door itself begins to glow accordingly, like the
actual frame of the metal door begins to go from

01:30:57.901 --> 01:31:07.820
this dull, dull old iron look to this almost red to
orange to white-hot vision and then fades to

01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:10.114
darkness, and the door (creaking).

01:31:10.114 --> 01:31:11.825
SAM: Would've burned us!

01:31:11.825 --> 01:31:13.712
LAURA: Hey, maybe?

01:31:13.712 --> 01:31:16.475
LIAM: Not us, not us.

01:31:16.475 --> 01:31:17.546
LAURA: Yeah.

01:31:17.546 --> 01:31:20.444
MARISHA: Is your unseen servant okay?

01:31:20.444 --> 01:31:23.503
SAM: Ah, he's fine, yeah? He's fine.

01:31:23.503 --> 01:31:26.166
LAURA: I walk through the gust of wind and get my
hair tousled.

01:31:26.166 --> 01:31:30.723
MATT: You go through. Your hair gets tousled. You
unintentionally shoulder-check Mort.

01:31:30.723 --> 01:31:32.696
LAURA: Sorry, Mort.

01:31:32.696 --> 01:31:37.771
LIAM: I'm going to see if I can see any traps
inside the room.

01:31:37.771 --> 01:31:39.771
MATT: Sure. Investigation check.

01:31:39.771 --> 01:31:44.506
LIAM: Yeah. Doesn't matter. 20.

01:31:44.506 --> 01:31:52.975
MATT: Stepping into the room, you do see that this
is a chamber familiar to you. You actually had a

01:31:52.975 --> 01:32:00.394
room similar to this in your keep. This is,
specifically, an arcane sanctuary. This is used

01:32:00.394 --> 01:32:07.141
for the construction and the enchantment and the
development of various arcane items. Similar to--

01:32:07.141 --> 01:32:13.283
you've seen the chamber before at Gilmore's,
although on smaller scale. This has seen various

01:32:13.283 --> 01:32:17.114
types of use. There's an alchemical setup in one
corner, untouched.

01:32:17.114 --> 01:32:21.771
LIAM: Wait, Scanlan.

01:32:21.771 --> 01:32:22.852
SAM: Oi!

01:32:22.852 --> 01:32:27.015
LIAM: Would you and your light-footed friend like
to join me in here?

01:32:27.015 --> 01:32:28.430
SAM: Sure, I'll come.

01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:29.376
LIAM: Yeah?

01:32:29.376 --> 01:32:31.659
SAM: Yes. Mort. Join me.

01:32:31.659 --> 01:32:33.691
MATT: Mort has joined you.

01:32:33.691 --> 01:32:34.653
SAM: Okay.

01:32:34.653 --> 01:32:39.192
LIAM: I don't want to touch anything in here. I
don't see any traps--

01:32:39.192 --> 01:32:41.413
TALIESIN: I want to touch everything in here.

01:32:41.413 --> 01:32:42.579
MARISHA: I do too.

01:32:42.579 --> 01:32:45.251
LIAM: Have at it. And I back up.

01:32:45.251 --> 01:32:48.101
SAM: All right, let's go pillage! I'll start
looking around and looting.

01:32:48.101 --> 01:32:49.528
MATT: Perception check.

01:32:49.528 --> 01:32:52.991
TALIESIN: I'm going to gingerly start looking to
see if anything is useful, because I have

01:32:52.991 --> 01:32:54.141
a lot of plans.

01:32:54.141 --> 01:32:55.802
MATT: Okay.

01:32:55.802 --> 01:32:56.952
SAM: Five.

01:32:56.952 --> 01:33:01.508
MATT: The architecture catches your attention.

01:33:01.508 --> 01:33:02.943
SAM: Ahh, it's beautiful.

01:33:02.943 --> 01:33:04.127
TALIESIN: 14.

01:33:04.127 --> 01:33:06.437
MATT: Okay. And what did you say you were going to
do?

01:33:06.437 --> 01:33:08.881
MARISHA: I wanted to head towards the alchemical
stuff to see if there's--

01:33:08.881 --> 01:33:10.652
MATT: Setup, okay, there's various glass
beakers--

01:33:10.652 --> 01:33:11.938
MARISHA: Supplies.

01:33:11.938 --> 01:33:16.703
MATT: I mean, there are supplies. You can see
there are. There is a small rack that has many

01:33:16.703 --> 01:33:23.684
glass vials that contain ground materials,
liquids, various metals, they're all labeled--

01:33:23.684 --> 01:33:25.990
what languages do you know?

01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:30.890
MARISHA: Primordial, Druidic, Sylvan. Elven.

01:33:30.890 --> 01:33:35.411
MATT: Oh, Elven? You're not able to read the
actual label.

01:33:35.411 --> 01:33:39.430
TALIESIN: Celestial. Can I read any of it?

01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:40.941
MATT: What other languages do you know?

01:33:40.941 --> 01:33:42.696
TALIESIN: Common, Celestial, Elven.

01:33:42.696 --> 01:33:44.004
MATT: Also can't read it.

01:33:44.004 --> 01:33:49.526
TALIESIN: Would I recognize any of the alchemical
symbols?

01:33:49.526 --> 01:33:57.371
MATT: From what you can tell, there's symbols for,
you know, mercurial liquid metals. There are many

01:33:57.371 --> 01:34:04.967
different herbal elements that are in here. There
are a few that the design on the label shows

01:34:04.967 --> 01:34:13.403
toxicity. You see there are iron filings, all
these things that are used in various-- You have

01:34:13.403 --> 01:34:15.253
the brew potion ability, correct?

01:34:15.253 --> 01:34:16.231
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:34:16.231 --> 01:34:21.133
MATT: So you also recognize some of these are used
in the process of preparing liquids with an

01:34:21.133 --> 01:34:25.303
easy-to-accept presentation when you're enchanting
and brewing a potion.

01:34:25.303 --> 01:34:28.360
MARISHA: I start clearing out the materials and
throw them in my bag.

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:29.455
MATT: Okay.

01:34:29.455 --> 01:34:31.822
LAURA: Can I look around for a fucking circlet?

01:34:31.822 --> 01:34:32.892
MATT: Go for it.

01:34:32.892 --> 01:34:34.892
MARISHA: What were you saying, Scanlan?

01:34:34.892 --> 01:34:39.077
SAM: Don't you have some ability that you can find
magical objects?

01:34:39.077 --> 01:34:40.899
LAURA: 16.

01:34:40.899 --> 01:34:49.256
MATT: 16? You look around the room. You don't see
a circlet, but what you do notice in the far end

01:34:49.256 --> 01:35:01.018
of the room is a 12-foot-tall humanoid structure
built of solid stone that stands there looming

01:35:01.018 --> 01:35:08.857
across the way. Giant piston-like stone arms, tree
trunk-like legs. You've encountered something like

01:35:08.857 --> 01:35:10.055
this before--

01:35:10.055 --> 01:35:12.106
LAURA: Yes. That looks very similar.

01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:14.447
LIAM: With Grog's dead dad.

01:35:14.447 --> 01:35:18.202
MATT: Well, no, this was in the druid barrows--

01:35:18.202 --> 01:35:27.706
LAURA: A golem that was up in the wall. How about
we tie its legs up? Just like we did before. Just

01:35:27.706 --> 01:35:30.526
in case he comes alive, then he can trip and
fall.

01:35:30.526 --> 01:35:35.610
MARISHA: Well, I'm assuming it's there in case
someone breaks in, like would trigger a trap.

01:35:35.610 --> 01:35:37.525
LAURA: I don't care, I start tying a rope around
his legs.

01:35:37.525 --> 01:35:41.360
LIAM: Yeah, don't we have that neverending rope?
Let's do it like 200 times around.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:46.460
MATT: All right. As you approach the giant stone
entity, pulling the rope out, you can see,

01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:53.455
embedded in the chest, there's a little slit, a
very, very tiny slit in its stone chest. You see a

01:35:53.455 --> 01:35:59.968
faint blue sparking glow, the very same color of
the cortex that you had recovered from the druid

01:35:59.968 --> 01:36:06.003
barrows when you were originally hired by Drez
Vina to recover it. As you see this and you

01:36:06.003 --> 01:36:08.816
approach, it doesn't seem to react.

01:36:08.816 --> 01:36:16.075
MARISHA: Right. Wait. And Drez sent us out through
Quall.

01:36:16.075 --> 01:36:17.646
LAURA: Yeah.

01:36:17.646 --> 01:36:19.116
MATT: The Master's who hired you.

01:36:19.116 --> 01:36:23.226
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah. So we fought this other
thing because of Quall.

01:36:23.226 --> 01:36:27.892
MARISHA: So why are these things showing up
wherever we go for Quall?

01:36:27.892 --> 01:36:30.092
LAURA: Well, because that's what he does.

01:36:30.092 --> 01:36:35.690
MATT: Well, the first one you encountered was
built for the barrow from whoever was in charge--

01:36:35.690 --> 01:36:38.962
LAURA: He wanted the orb to bring this thing to
life.

01:36:38.962 --> 01:36:44.796
MARISHA: Oh, that's right, and now he made-- now
we see the fruits of our labor. I see.

01:36:44.796 --> 01:36:45.891
SAM: We made this thing?

01:36:45.891 --> 01:36:51.910
MARISHA: We brought back the crystal so he could
make this thing.

01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:53.298
SAM: Wow.

01:36:53.298 --> 01:36:57.731
TALIESIN: I have no idea what you're talking
about.

01:36:57.731 --> 01:37:00.810
LAURA: If I take a step forward, does he look like
it has any kind of reaction?

01:37:00.810 --> 01:37:04.073
MATT: You take a step forward. No reaction.

01:37:04.073 --> 01:37:08.626
LAURA: I'm going to keep trying to tie around his
legs.

01:37:08.626 --> 01:37:11.871
LIAM: I'll help her out, and we'll go back and
back and all around.

01:37:11.871 --> 01:37:14.503
MATT: Okay. You guys bring the rope around and you
tie it pretty taut around the legs, which are

01:37:14.503 --> 01:37:19.345
pretty close together. They're not like in a wide
aggressive stance. It's standing there inert. You

01:37:19.345 --> 01:37:22.525
wrap the rope around it multiple times, give it
the best knots that you have.

01:37:22.525 --> 01:37:26.520
LAURA: All right, well. I feel safer.

01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:34.248
LIAM: I grab-- in my bag I have the charcoal that
I once painted half a beard on Grog with, and I

01:37:34.248 --> 01:37:38.412
use it to draw a little curly mustache on it.

01:37:38.412 --> 01:37:39.908
LAURA: Really?

01:37:39.908 --> 01:37:44.062
MATT: Okay, so as you climb to the top and you get
up there and smear this big ol' Pringles can-style

01:37:44.062 --> 01:37:49.032
mustache out of charcoal on the front of this
stone golem's featureless face.

01:37:49.032 --> 01:37:51.121
Now it has personality.

01:37:51.121 --> 01:37:56.028
LAURA: Can you try to look at its chest? It has a
little blue glimmer in it. Climb down and look and

01:37:56.028 --> 01:37:57.078
see if you can--

01:37:57.078 --> 01:38:02.562
LIAM: Yeah, I'm more comfortable drawing mustaches
on it than I am dickering with its power source.

01:38:02.562 --> 01:38:04.160
LAURA: Just look and see what it is.

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:08.307
LIAM: I look at the crystal, admire it, go
dink-dink with a knuckle.

01:38:08.307 --> 01:38:11.994
MATT: You glance through this little slit and it's
about that wide, like you can barely see the

01:38:11.994 --> 01:38:17.204
flicker, and the stone is about a good foot and a
half, two feet deep before you even see the source

01:38:17.204 --> 01:38:22.942
of the light. It's a very, very thin slit to it,
and from what little bit you can see, you see the

01:38:22.942 --> 01:38:28.572
gem is embedded in there with multiple metallic
and stone things keeping it suspended there.

01:38:28.572 --> 01:38:33.053
LIAM: Can I inspect the chest of this creature
like it's a trap?

01:38:33.053 --> 01:38:34.997
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:38:34.997 --> 01:38:37.519
LAURA: Can I see if the golem's wearing a
circlet?

01:38:37.519 --> 01:38:39.297
LIAM: 20.

01:38:39.297 --> 01:38:44.220
MATT: 20. Ah, well, he was up against its head,
there was no circlet on the golem. Looking at it,

01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:48.560
I mean, there's no trap per se, it's part of the
construct of this construct.

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.656
LIAM: What's it made of. Is it metal or stone?

01:38:50.656 --> 01:38:51.691
MATT: Stone.

01:38:51.691 --> 01:38:53.731
LIAM: Is there any way to open it? From the
front?

01:38:53.731 --> 01:38:55.238
MATT: Not from what you can see, no.

01:38:55.238 --> 01:38:56.771
LIAM: Okay.

01:38:56.771 --> 01:38:59.397
SAM: Should I go upstairs and get Grog, just in
case things get ugly?

01:38:59.397 --> 01:39:02.933
LIAM: I add a little pointy beard on the bottom of
his chin.

01:39:02.933 --> 01:39:04.145
MATT: Okay.

01:39:04.145 --> 01:39:06.313
LAURA: We should keep looking. Anybody else want
to look around the room for the circlet?

01:39:06.313 --> 01:39:09.881
TALIESIN: I feel like this is not the only room.
This is not enough. I feel like there's--

01:39:09.881 --> 01:39:12.400
MARISHA: Yeah, I start looking around to see if
there's hidden chambers,

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:14.646
loose stones in the wall--

01:39:14.646 --> 01:39:20.868
SAM: Keyleth, don't you have something that he
gave us?

01:39:20.868 --> 01:39:29.571
MARISHA: Oh, that's true, the Hunk of Quall. I
pull out the Hunk of Quall.

01:39:29.571 --> 01:39:39.519
MATT: Okay. Pull it out, hold it aloft, it begins
to glow a little bit and react. The golem's chest

01:39:39.519 --> 01:39:50.321
glows a little bit and reacts. In a far distant
corner, underneath the alchemical table, in a pile

01:39:50.321 --> 01:39:55.564
of some pieces of wood and crumpled stone, there's
a slight dull glow.

01:39:55.564 --> 01:39:59.753
MARISHA: I walk over and I start brushing it
away.

01:39:59.753 --> 01:40:06.256
MATT: Okay, you pull it away. You find an almost
full loop of metal.

01:40:06.256 --> 01:40:09.923
MARISHA: Would it be a dark iron cobalt band?

01:40:09.923 --> 01:40:11.476
MATT: Yeah, it is, actually.

01:40:11.476 --> 01:40:14.358
TRAVIS: Thank god for that lump of Quall.

01:40:14.358 --> 01:40:21.318
SAM: Oi, did she pick it up already?

01:40:21.318 --> 01:40:22.119
MATT: Yeah.

01:40:22.119 --> 01:40:23.184
SAM: Didn't kill us?

01:40:23.184 --> 01:40:24.227
MATT: No.

01:40:24.227 --> 01:40:27.296
SAM: Well, that's good. Did it wake up the beast?

01:40:27.296 --> 01:40:34.311
MATT: No, the circlet's glow has faded. You have
it in your hand.

01:40:34.311 --> 01:40:36.432
LAURA: Well. We have the thing.

01:40:36.432 --> 01:40:42.626
TALIESIN: I'm going to quickly take a look at the
papers that were buried in--

01:40:42.626 --> 01:40:55.227
MATT: A series of notes scribbled on the paper.
You can see a number of sketches of the construct

01:40:55.227 --> 01:41:03.281
of the actual golem itself, pieces of its body and
its form, but some of it's been torn and crumpled

01:41:03.281 --> 01:41:05.326
up, tossed aside, failed attempts.

01:41:05.326 --> 01:41:07.601
TALIESIN: Failed attempts? Does he write his name
anywhere?

01:41:07.601 --> 01:41:08.716
MATT: No.

01:41:08.716 --> 01:41:09.954
TALIESIN: Damn.

01:41:09.954 --> 01:41:17.251
MARISHA: I take off my very prized circlet that I
love oh so much.

01:41:17.251 --> 01:41:18.560
MATT: Okay.

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:20.761
MARISHA: Why'd you make that face?

01:41:20.761 --> 01:41:24.689
MATT: No, nothing. What're you doing?

01:41:24.689 --> 01:41:27.608
MARISHA: And I put the serpent circlet on.

01:41:27.608 --> 01:41:28.762
MATT: Okay.

01:41:28.762 --> 01:41:30.819
MARISHA: And I concentrate to see what it feels
like.

01:41:30.819 --> 01:41:32.014
MATT: Okay.

01:41:32.014 --> 01:41:35.629
MARISHA: And I hand my circlet to-- Don't break
it!

01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:37.005
SAM: Of course I'm not going to break it!

01:41:37.005 --> 01:41:38.126
MARISHA: It's a family heirloom.

01:41:38.126 --> 01:41:39.911
SAM: I'll have Mort hold it. Mort!

01:41:39.911 --> 01:41:47.027
MATT: So the circlet floats in the air, just out
of reach. Concentrate, as soon as you place it on

01:41:47.027 --> 01:41:52.440
your head, it locks to the sides of your head and
you feel this cold probing into your mind

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:53.759
for a moment.

01:41:53.759 --> 01:41:56.639
TALIESIN: It's installing Windows.

01:41:56.639 --> 01:41:59.334
MARISHA: Not Windows 10, not Windows 10, god damn
it!

01:41:59.334 --> 01:42:04.997
(laughter)

01:42:04.997 --> 01:42:07.926
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry.

01:42:07.926 --> 01:42:14.577
LIAM: Into the corner. Face the corner for a
minute.

01:42:14.577 --> 01:42:20.974
MATT: It's funny because it's relevant. All right.
So, you feel there is a connection trying to be

01:42:20.974 --> 01:42:28.926
made, but you would need time to attune to this,
should you want to take the time to do so. 30

01:42:28.926 --> 01:42:30.709
minutes to an hour, depending.

01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:34.564
TALIESIN: Let's take all of this out of the house,
maybe.

01:42:34.564 --> 01:42:36.450
LAURA: Including the golem?

01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:43.018
MARISHA: I want to stay here and see. You guys
continue looking around. I'm going to meditate for

01:42:43.018 --> 01:42:44.130
a second.

01:42:44.130 --> 01:42:47.908
MATT: Grog, much time goes by. 20, 30 minutes. Not
a peep. Silence.

01:42:47.908 --> 01:42:54.901
TRAVIS: Can I, since I'm bored-- I look up and
down the street. Anything suspicious?

01:42:54.901 --> 01:43:04.472
MATT: I mean, a few folks wander by, looking
nervous around you. Make a perception check.

01:43:04.472 --> 01:43:15.550
TRAVIS: Hey! Minus, no, plus one. No. (laughs)
Eightee-- wait.

01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:17.965
(laughter)

01:43:17.965 --> 01:43:19.322
TRAVIS: Zero. 19!

01:43:19.322 --> 01:43:27.043
MATT: Okay. You do notice on the far end of the
street there does appear to be a pair of

01:43:27.043 --> 01:43:29.784
individuals that are leaned against a building,
looking right at you.

01:43:29.784 --> 01:43:33.400
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:37.533
MATT: They're about a block and a half down the
direction you came.

01:43:37.533 --> 01:43:45.169
TRAVIS: I don't look at them. Can I try to attune
with my new bloodaxe while I'm waiting?

01:43:45.169 --> 01:43:47.109
MATT: You can. Just the bloodaxe?

01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:52.787
TRAVIS: Both.

01:43:52.787 --> 01:43:58.193
MATT: Okay. So you sit down, your hands still
inside the gauntlets, and take a moment to find

01:43:58.193 --> 01:44:04.830
the connection. You feel this rush of adrenaline
hit your body as your hands seem to go numb for a

01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:11.730
moment, and in a flash your eyes see the chaos of
the elements, of the creation of planets slamming

01:44:11.730 --> 01:44:19.356
into flames and earth, this instant vision of
the very force of creation, a time before

01:44:19.356 --> 01:44:24.896
civilization, and you feel that fiery wrath all of
a sudden burn through your fingertips. The vision

01:44:24.896 --> 01:44:28.589
ends and you look down, and as you curl your
fingers, strength pulses through your body that

01:44:28.589 --> 01:44:35.296
you haven't understood in a while. As you're
coming over that moment, the bloodaxe solidifies

01:44:35.296 --> 01:44:43.704
in your grip, and you can see where this rush
could definitely send Kevdak's head to get a

01:44:43.704 --> 01:44:45.235
little big.

01:44:45.235 --> 01:44:46.583
TRAVIS: Sweet.

01:44:46.583 --> 01:44:49.353
TALIESIN: The power of Neil deGrasse Tyson is with
you.

01:44:49.353 --> 01:44:53.077
(laughter)

01:44:53.077 --> 01:44:56.252
LIAM: But you know, let's go kill the dragon
before we get the rest of these things, because

01:44:56.252 --> 01:44:57.063
that's a good idea.

01:44:57.063 --> 01:44:58.969
TALIESIN: Because that's going to be great. God.

01:44:58.969 --> 01:45:02.603
MATT: So, you take the time and eventually the
connection finds its way and there's a clarity,

01:45:02.603 --> 01:45:09.079
and you, as it hits you at the end of this restful
period in the basement, you open your eyes and you

01:45:09.079 --> 01:45:18.071
feel-- it's hard to describe, a bit of coldness in
your head that's off to the right side of your

01:45:18.071 --> 01:45:21.398
head. It's this slight tickle of cold.

01:45:21.398 --> 01:45:23.707
LIAM: That's no fun.

01:45:23.707 --> 01:45:27.727
MARISHA: Slight tickle of cold?

01:45:27.727 --> 01:45:31.135
MATT: Right there, almost like inside your skull.

01:45:31.135 --> 01:45:34.830
MARISHA: I concentrate on it.

01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:36.489
MATT: Okay.

01:45:36.489 --> 01:45:39.440
MARISHA: And I see if I can manifest the cold?

01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:46.007
MATT: Okay. You look down at your hands and try to
manifest the cold. Nothing happens.

01:45:46.007 --> 01:45:48.931
MARISHA: I focus on the golem.

01:45:48.931 --> 01:45:53.457
MATT: You turn to the golem, and as you turn, the
cold shifts to the front, in the direction

01:45:53.457 --> 01:45:54.723
of the golem.

01:45:54.723 --> 01:45:57.664
LAURA: Oh! Yeah yeah yeah.

01:45:57.664 --> 01:46:10.476
MARISHA: I look at the golem, and I say, step
forward.

01:46:10.476 --> 01:46:17.976
MATT: Suddenly, the eyes, which were dark, flare
with bright blue light, matching his chest--

01:46:17.976 --> 01:46:20.190
LAURA: Oh shit, oh wait, his legs are tied up--

01:46:20.190 --> 01:46:25.877
MATT: --and as he does, fwoomp, boom! Face-down
onto the ground, the rope coming taut, it slams

01:46:25.877 --> 01:46:32.794
into the floor. You hear this loud impact beneath
the ground.

01:46:32.794 --> 01:46:34.736
SAM: We're okay, we're okay.

01:46:34.736 --> 01:46:40.960
LIAM: I swivel out a dagger and cut right below
the knot.

01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:43.477
LAURA: He looked like a moron. That was amazing.

01:46:43.477 --> 01:46:45.193
MARISHA: And I go, sorry! Sorry!

01:46:45.193 --> 01:46:47.466
MATT: No response. It's still face-down on the
ground.

01:46:47.466 --> 01:46:49.077
LAURA: I'm on the ground laughing.

01:46:49.077 --> 01:46:53.907
MARISHA: And I go, rise.

01:46:53.907 --> 01:46:59.278
LIAM: Wait wait, one second, one second! We tied
it around a lot of times. Hold on!

01:46:59.278 --> 01:47:04.831
MATT: As you're trying to cut the rope free, it
starts standing up. You finally pull away as its

01:47:04.831 --> 01:47:12.494
foot backs up and almost crushes you. As it rights
itself and stands before you.

01:47:12.494 --> 01:47:14.205
LIAM: Look at that mustache.

01:47:14.205 --> 01:47:23.798
MATT: It has a majestic, black mustache across its
face, its glowing arcane-driven eye sockets and

01:47:23.798 --> 01:47:29.187
its pulsing blue energy source in its chest,
stands looking down at you intently.

01:47:29.187 --> 01:47:33.311
TALIESIN: I'm going to go diving to see if there's
an instruction manual somewhere in this room. I'm

01:47:33.311 --> 01:47:35.228
on my hands and knees going through the papers.

01:47:35.228 --> 01:47:40.814
MARISHA: I look at the rest of them and I go, holy
shit.

01:47:40.814 --> 01:47:43.516
ASHLEY: Make him wave!

01:47:43.516 --> 01:47:51.244
MARISHA: And I say, your manners. Wave to Pike.

01:47:51.244 --> 01:47:57.532
ASHLEY: Keyleth, that's awesome!

01:47:57.532 --> 01:48:05.301
MARISHA: And then I say, and a curtsey for Vex.

01:48:05.301 --> 01:48:08.477
SAM: Oh, come on, don't demean him.

01:48:08.477 --> 01:48:13.122
MARISHA: This is the coolest!

01:48:13.122 --> 01:48:16.227
LIAM: Can it do a double-bird?

01:48:16.227 --> 01:48:23.894
MARISHA: And I say, what do we say to those who we
have just vanquished?

01:48:23.894 --> 01:48:34.336
MATT: Turns to Vax. Big ol' stony middle fingers
about that wide around.

01:48:34.336 --> 01:48:39.926
MARISHA: And I look at him and I say, never forget
that.

01:48:39.926 --> 01:48:42.471
SAM: He doesn't have a mind.

01:48:42.471 --> 01:48:44.598
MARISHA: He has my mind.

01:48:44.598 --> 01:48:47.835
LAURA: 21. What I rolled.

01:48:47.835 --> 01:48:54.034
MATT: As you guys are scanning around the floor,
no sign of any sort of instruction manual, the way

01:48:54.034 --> 01:48:57.733
that things have been pulled out of here, and the
way the circlet was found, you get the feeling as

01:48:57.733 --> 01:49:04.615
you look about this place that in the escape,
Quall was grabbing and Drez Vina were grabbing

01:49:04.615 --> 01:49:09.190
everything they could, and didn't realize until they
had left that the circlet had fallen from their

01:49:09.190 --> 01:49:14.184
grasp and been left behind. Anything else they
probably have that is pertaining to this

01:49:14.184 --> 01:49:15.340
experiment.

01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:16.906
SAM: Well, we have a killing machine now.

01:49:16.906 --> 01:49:19.392
LAURA: How do we get him out?

01:49:19.392 --> 01:49:21.047
MARISHA: That's what I was just thinking.

01:49:21.047 --> 01:49:24.895
SAM: Can only creatures go in your locket thing?

01:49:24.895 --> 01:49:26.537
LAURA: I don't know.

01:49:26.537 --> 01:49:29.292
SAM: Well, probably only creatures.

01:49:29.292 --> 01:49:30.622
TALIESIN: There's only one way to find out.

01:49:30.622 --> 01:49:44.388
LAURA: Okay, yeah, I pop Trinket out. It says a
creature no more than large in size.

01:49:44.388 --> 01:49:47.997
MATT: He's a construct.

01:49:47.997 --> 01:49:49.393
LAURA: So no?

01:49:49.393 --> 01:49:51.207
MATT: Well, I mean, you'd have to try to find
out.

01:49:51.207 --> 01:49:53.556
LAURA: I walk up. He's not going to hit me, is he,
Keyleth?

01:49:53.556 --> 01:50:06.371
MARISHA: I'll tell him not to. I tell him, hey!
(whispers) What should I? Should I say his name?

01:50:06.371 --> 01:50:07.837
Does he have a name?

01:50:07.837 --> 01:50:09.010
LAURA: Spike!

01:50:09.010 --> 01:50:13.539
MARISHA: I like it. Spike! Is he spikey at all?
He's bludgeony.

01:50:13.539 --> 01:50:16.021
LAURA: I don't know, I just liked the name.

01:50:16.021 --> 01:50:20.129
MARISHA: Okay, I ask him, are you called
something?

01:50:20.129 --> 01:50:21.535
SAM: He doesn't have a mind.

01:50:21.535 --> 01:50:22.726
LAURA: Can he talk?

01:50:22.726 --> 01:50:24.341
MATT: There's no response.

01:50:24.341 --> 01:50:27.400
SAM: Fassbender.

01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:31.298
MARISHA: (laughs) Fassbender? No.

01:50:31.298 --> 01:50:32.830
LAURA: Why?

01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:34.320
SAM: Too hunky?

01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:39.017
LAURA: Can he put his finger down, and I hold the
locket up. Hey, Fassbender.

01:50:39.017 --> 01:50:43.878
MARISHA: Enter the locket, Fassbender.

01:50:43.878 --> 01:50:48.631
MATT: Puts the finger out. Touches the locket.

01:50:48.631 --> 01:50:50.738
SAM: Ahh, dammit.

01:50:50.738 --> 01:50:55.248
LAURA: Nope. No luck.

01:50:55.248 --> 01:50:58.714
MARISHA: Good work, Fassbender. I guess we walk
him out of here.

01:50:58.714 --> 01:51:02.258
TALIESIN: Or cast a spell.

01:51:02.258 --> 01:51:04.448
SAM: Oh, if only I had any.

01:51:04.448 --> 01:51:07.683
TALIESIN: If only he had any spells.

01:51:07.683 --> 01:51:11.586
MARISHA: What kind of a spell?

01:51:11.586 --> 01:51:15.031
TRAVIS: What are you guys doing down there that is
so loud?

01:51:15.031 --> 01:51:20.011
SAM: Sorry, we met somebody who's even stronger
and awesomer than you. But we still love you and

01:51:20.011 --> 01:51:21.810
we'll bring him out to meet you soon.

01:51:21.810 --> 01:51:26.912
TALIESIN: Keyleth has a pet giant robot. I don't
know what to make of this.

01:51:26.912 --> 01:51:28.606
LIAM: A what?

01:51:28.606 --> 01:51:31.769
TALIESIN: It's a thing I've been working on, but
apparently someone else has done it first, so

01:51:31.769 --> 01:51:32.809
never mind.

01:51:32.809 --> 01:51:34.171
MARISHA: It's a thing you've been working on?

01:51:34.171 --> 01:51:35.893
TALIESIN: Never mind! I'm not working on it
anymore!

01:51:35.893 --> 01:51:38.234
(laughter)

01:51:38.234 --> 01:51:39.936
SAM: You can do a pocket fisherman instead.

01:51:39.936 --> 01:51:41.607
TALIESIN: It's passé and stupid. I don't want to
hear about it.

01:51:41.607 --> 01:51:48.541
MATT: So what's the plan?

01:51:48.541 --> 01:51:50.770
MARISHA: I walk him out.

01:51:50.770 --> 01:51:53.449
SAM: Wait! Oh no, he's not a creature. I can't
make him invisible.

01:51:53.449 --> 01:51:57.891
MATT: I mean, he is a creature. Just the
particular enchantment based on this, you get the

01:51:57.891 --> 01:52:02.652
sense that as part of the realm of the Raven Queen
is the living and the dead, and this is not

01:52:02.652 --> 01:52:07.253
necessarily a living creature, it's a construct
and the magic does not have an effect on it.

01:52:07.253 --> 01:52:08.727
SAM: Oh. Any magic.

01:52:08.727 --> 01:52:10.095
MATT: That magic.

01:52:10.095 --> 01:52:13.150
SAM: I could try to make him invisible.

01:52:13.150 --> 01:52:15.008
LAURA: Oh, that's good!

01:52:15.008 --> 01:52:17.493
SAM: It says creature.

01:52:17.493 --> 01:52:25.455
MARISHA: Scanlan, do you have a circlet right now?
You had the Ioun stones. Do you have anything on

01:52:25.455 --> 01:52:26.459
your head?

01:52:26.459 --> 01:52:27.670
SAM: I am fully attuned.

01:52:27.670 --> 01:52:29.113
MATT: Yeah, this requires attunement to wear.

01:52:29.113 --> 01:52:34.532
LIAM: Keyleth, is this something you're going to
want to do in the long term?

01:52:34.532 --> 01:52:46.152
MARISHA: Well, my circlet, I'm a bit attached to
it and it's very nice and has a lot of benefits to it.

01:52:46.152 --> 01:52:49.449
LIAM: So if we're going to go to the trouble of
taking this thing out of here, one of us has to

01:52:49.449 --> 01:52:52.646
use it. What about your Pom-pom, or-- what did you
call him?

01:52:52.646 --> 01:52:57.879
ASHLEY: Pop-Pop? Pop-Pop could do it, but I don't
know if he would be very--

01:52:57.879 --> 01:53:07.014
MARISHA: I can wield. I can use him. Honestly,
Fassbender might be something that we use

01:53:07.014 --> 01:53:10.133
sometimes and not all the time anyway. Maybe?

01:53:10.133 --> 01:53:13.542
TALIESIN: Could we get him into the Bag of
Holding?

01:53:13.542 --> 01:53:14.787
LIAM: I doubt it.

01:53:14.787 --> 01:53:16.344
MATT: Has to fit through the opening.

01:53:16.344 --> 01:53:18.214
TALIESIN: Yeah. We don't have a big enough Bag of
Holding.

01:53:18.214 --> 01:53:32.124
LIAM: Ooh, I have an invention idea. Could you
build a little gnome chair for either Scanlan or

01:53:32.124 --> 01:53:35.190
Pike or Wilhand on the back of it?

01:53:35.190 --> 01:53:36.931
LAURA: But I think he moves rather slow.

01:53:36.931 --> 01:53:39.206
TALIESIN: Yes, it would be so Mad Max. It would be
beyond Thunderdome.

01:53:39.206 --> 01:53:42.652
LIAM: I don't get that reference, but I think you
feel me.

01:53:42.652 --> 01:53:45.598
LAURA: How fast can he run?

01:53:45.598 --> 01:53:49.018
MARISHA: Well, let's try it, I guess.

01:53:49.018 --> 01:53:53.464
TALIESIN: Perhaps let's try this somewhere that is
not a basement filled with chemicals.

01:53:53.464 --> 01:53:56.879
SAM: We can try this in the mansion. If we can get
him through the door.

01:53:56.879 --> 01:53:59.516
MARISHA: Let's make him invisible and get him to
the mansion.

01:53:59.516 --> 01:54:01.918
SAM: I'll try to turn him invisible. I don't think
it'll work, though, but--

01:54:01.918 --> 01:54:07.812
MATT: You cast the spell for a second, using your
bardic flair you wink and reach out and touch the

01:54:07.812 --> 01:54:11.099
golem, and the golem's form vanishes.

01:54:11.099 --> 01:54:16.932
SAM: Hey, that's great, all right, let's get outta
here then.

01:54:16.932 --> 01:54:21.488
MATT: You tell it to follow?

01:54:21.488 --> 01:54:24.483
MARISH: Let's see how this works. Follow.

01:54:24.483 --> 01:54:26.394
MATT: (stomping)

01:54:26.394 --> 01:54:27.586
LAURA: Well, he's rather loud.

01:54:27.586 --> 01:54:31.027
MATT: As you guys come to the doorway and begin
stepping through, you watch as the doorframe goes

01:54:31.027 --> 01:54:36.811
(breaking metal), and it's bent outward like
something bursting out of a tuna can.

01:54:36.811 --> 01:54:39.306
(laughter)

01:54:39.306 --> 01:54:45.717
MARISHA: Shit. Hey, Vex? Do you have a Pass
Without a Trace handy?

01:54:45.717 --> 01:54:53.262
LAURA: Let me see how many spells I have left. I
think I do. Yeah, I can do Pass Without a Trace, I

01:54:53.262 --> 01:54:54.498
have a couple left.

01:54:54.498 --> 01:54:58.303
ASHLEY: I couldn't possibly use my Glove of
Storing, could I? To hold his hand?

01:54:58.303 --> 01:55:05.322
MATT: You can try. You know from your experience
that the Glove of Storing is usually

01:55:05.322 --> 01:55:06.990
for handheld objects.

01:55:06.990 --> 01:55:08.793
ASHLEY: All right.

01:55:08.793 --> 01:55:13.861
LAURA: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on
all of us, including the golem.

01:55:13.861 --> 01:55:14.711
MATT: Okay.

01:55:14.711 --> 01:55:21.092
MARISHA: And I'm going to tell the golem to walk
quietly and stealth. Or attempt to, as best as he can.

01:55:21.092 --> 01:55:28.541
MATT: (stomping) You guys make your way up the
stairs. As you make it up towards the top of the

01:55:28.541 --> 01:55:32.838
stair landing, you hear the crashing of wood
behind you as the golem begins making its way up

01:55:32.838 --> 01:55:34.498
the staircase, destroying it in the process.

01:55:34.498 --> 01:55:36.929
MARISHA: (stammering) What? Why is it? No!

01:55:36.929 --> 01:55:38.203
SAM: He's wider than the stairs.

01:55:38.203 --> 01:55:39.413
MARISHA: Why is it going up the staircase?

01:55:39.413 --> 01:55:40.500
SAM: Because we're going up the staircase!

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:43.803
MARISHA: Oh, we're going, oh. I thought we were
outside the front door.

01:55:43.803 --> 01:55:49.608
MATT: No, this is all down in the basement. You
guys make your way up, as it tears through the

01:55:49.608 --> 01:55:58.441
stairs. There is a stonework incline the stairs
are built on, so it just destroys the wood, but it

01:55:58.441 --> 01:56:03.496
still manages to make its way up into the house
itself, breaking through the banister. You don't

01:56:03.496 --> 01:56:09.835
even see it, you just see parts of the house (sounds of
destruction). It steps forward into the center of

01:56:09.835 --> 01:56:14.608
the room on one of the plates that you had marked.
The thing goes (impact). And stops in the middle

01:56:14.608 --> 01:56:18.277
of the air, before a couple smoke sparks go
(sparks).

01:56:18.277 --> 01:56:19.842
LAURA: This thing is awesome.

01:56:19.842 --> 01:56:23.139
MATT: Another one. (impacts)

01:56:23.139 --> 01:56:26.814
LIAM: I feel like Quall didn't really think this
through.

01:56:26.814 --> 01:56:36.003
SAM: Are you still unclear about whether we should
kill this dragon or not? We have a killing machine now!

01:56:36.003 --> 01:56:37.250
LIAM: Does it fly?

01:56:37.250 --> 01:56:40.148
SAM: It doesn't matter. He can catch it with his
hand!

01:56:40.148 --> 01:56:43.315
LAURA: That's true. He actually might be able to
hold onto it. At least for a little bit.

01:56:43.315 --> 01:56:50.563
MATT: The golem's about 12 feet tall, ten to 12.
The dragon's like 30 to 40.

01:56:50.563 --> 01:56:51.722
SAM: Yeah, yeah!

01:56:51.722 --> 01:56:53.996
LAURA: So the dragon could probably like fly away
with it.

01:56:53.996 --> 01:56:58.590
TALIESIN: The dragon would find him a very
uncomfortable horse pill to swallow.

01:56:58.590 --> 01:57:02.199
SAM: However, him plus a bunch of other people
could probably hold the dragon.

01:57:02.199 --> 01:57:04.468
MARISHA: Let's get back to the mansion.

01:57:04.468 --> 01:57:09.364
LAURA: Wait, can he get through the mansion door?

01:57:09.364 --> 01:57:13.093
TALIESIN: We will tell him delicately to kneel and
crawl.

01:57:13.093 --> 01:57:17.025
MARISHA: I mean, it's a magic door. Scanlan, can
you just make the door a little bigger to fit him?

01:57:17.025 --> 01:57:20.314
SAM: Why don't we have him smash through it? Who
cares? We don't live here.

01:57:20.314 --> 01:57:24.401
LIAM: We're talking about your mansion door.

01:57:24.401 --> 01:57:31.261
MATT: You guys all look at Grog across the street,
sitting, clutching the bloodaxe, almost in a lotus

01:57:31.261 --> 01:57:33.805
position, looking at it.

01:57:33.805 --> 01:57:35.241
LIAM: Hey buddy, whatcha doing over there?

01:57:35.241 --> 01:57:40.539
MATT: You guys glance up and see Grog smiling, as
suddenly behind them, (crashing), the doorway

01:57:40.539 --> 01:57:47.802
blows out and wood gets thrown out in the middle
of the roadway, splintered ruin. There's a giant

01:57:47.802 --> 01:57:52.248
dome shape of the front of the house where brick
and wood has been blown out.

01:57:52.248 --> 01:57:58.228
TRAVIS: You guys, the door is exploding! Move!
This way! I race across the street to them with

01:57:58.228 --> 01:57:59.536
the bloodaxe in my hands.

01:57:59.536 --> 01:58:03.940
MATT: Okay, you get halfway across, pass them
before &lt;i&gt;whack&lt;/i&gt;! Something hits you really hard in

01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:07.609
the face, and you can already feel the blood
running in the back of your sinuses.

01:58:07.609 --> 01:58:10.808
MARISHA: And I say, Grog, meet Fassbender.
Fassbender, Grog.

01:58:10.808 --> 01:58:13.430
TRAVIS: I don't understand what you're telling me
right now.

01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:18.527
MARISHA: He's invisible, but he's a giant stone
golem!

01:58:18.527 --> 01:58:22.422
TRAVIS: Can I reach out with my hand and try and
touch whatever it was that smashed me in the face?

01:58:22.422 --> 01:58:26.558
MATT: You reach out and there's a very solid
surface in front of you.

01:58:26.558 --> 01:58:30.164
MARISHA: And I say, Fassbender, shake Grog's hand.
Remember, manners!

01:58:30.164 --> 01:58:37.629
MATT: You reach up, as you're feeling out, all of
a sudden, a giant form grasps you from behind and

01:58:37.629 --> 01:58:39.339
shakes your hand. Roll a strength check.

01:58:39.339 --> 01:58:40.437
MARISHA: Ooh.

01:58:40.437 --> 01:58:42.967
SAM: Your arm gets torn off.

01:58:42.967 --> 01:58:44.185
LAURA: Oh god.

01:58:44.185 --> 01:58:48.469
LIAM: Also, I lost a hitpoint when he flicked me
in the nuts. Nothing? Nothing.

01:58:48.469 --> 01:58:51.237
TRAVIS: A new strength check, right? 19.

01:58:51.237 --> 01:58:59.113
MATT: 19. As this invisible hand meets, the
strength is overwhelming, and then as you focus,

01:58:59.113 --> 01:59:03.024
you take over the handshake and force it to move
your way.

01:59:03.024 --> 01:59:05.483
SAM: Ooh, you're stronger than the thing!

01:59:05.483 --> 01:59:07.127
MATT: You are stronger than it.

01:59:07.127 --> 01:59:10.808
TRAVIS: What the fuck is grabbing my hand?

01:59:10.808 --> 01:59:13.538
MARISHA: Fassbender. Scanlan named him.

01:59:13.538 --> 01:59:15.942
TRAVIS: Yeah, you keep saying that word. I don't
know what it means.

01:59:15.942 --> 01:59:20.211
LAURA: We'll show you what he looks like in the
mansion. I see you're wearing the gauntlets, Grog.

01:59:20.211 --> 01:59:22.201
TRAVIS: Yeah, I've been wearing them.

01:59:22.201 --> 01:59:26.012
ASHLEY: You've attuned to them.

01:59:26.012 --> 01:59:28.306
TRAVIS: I did.

01:59:28.306 --> 01:59:30.471
MARISHA: You have a nice glow about you.

01:59:30.471 --> 01:59:34.769
SAM: You don't have hair up there.

01:59:34.769 --> 01:59:49.962
MATT: As you guys make your way back towards the
classic Trickfoot estate with the somewhat muted

01:59:49.962 --> 02:00:00.107
(stomping) behind you. The sun is just now
starting to hit the sunset period of the day. The

02:00:00.107 --> 02:00:07.402
sky's going from a blue to a lighter white to an
orange color, dusk is upon you shortly. And with

02:00:07.402 --> 02:00:08.751
that, we're going to take a bathroom break.

02:00:08.751 --> 02:00:09.749
LAURA: Yay!

02:00:09.749 --> 02:00:10.607
MARISHA: Bathroom break.

02:00:10.607 --> 02:00:14.465
MATT: We'll be back here shortly, guys, once again
I want to say give some love to our Loot Crate

02:00:14.465 --> 02:00:17.904
sponsors if you can, at the very least go check it
out and see what they got, go to

02:00:17.904 --> 02:00:22.872
www.lootcrate.com/criticalrole. Even if you're not
interested in subscribing right now, go click on

02:00:22.872 --> 02:00:27.126
the link and let them know that Critters have some
eyes and want to show them some love.

02:00:27.126 --> 02:00:29.618
MARISHA: That Critters have power.

02:00:29.618 --> 02:00:33.076
MATT: But yeah, guys, we'll see you back here in a
few minutes.

02:00:33.076 --> 02:00:35.039
ALL: Woo!

02:00:35.039 --> 02:13:23.303
[break]

02:13:23.303 --> 02:13:30.666
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So! Back from break,
Vox Machina made their way back to Wilhand's

02:13:30.666 --> 02:13:41.818
estate, the Trickfoots. For the sake of brevity,
you did manage to get the Fassbender golem in

02:13:41.818 --> 02:13:48.190
through the ten-foot-tall door, five-foot-wide
that leads into it. So it was able to barely

02:13:48.190 --> 02:13:50.547
squeeze in if you wanted to leave it there for the
time being.

02:13:50.547 --> 02:13:51.867
SAM: Absolutely.

02:13:51.867 --> 02:13:54.413
MATT: Okay. There it fits into it.

02:13:54.413 --> 02:13:56.899
MARISHA: I want to try some stuff.

02:13:56.899 --> 02:13:57.985
MATT: What do you want to try?

02:13:57.985 --> 02:14:02.398
MARISHA: Hang on, I'm tweeting out a link for Loot
Crate.

02:14:02.398 --> 02:14:07.605
TRAVIS: I would like to go down to the training
area where I normally sleep. Pike! Would you come

02:14:07.605 --> 02:14:08.711
with me?

02:14:08.711 --> 02:14:13.861
ASHLEY: Yup. I want to train, too. Sit-ups.

02:14:13.861 --> 02:14:17.556
MARISHA: How big is the training area, can we all
be in the training area practicing our skills?

02:14:17.556 --> 02:14:19.536
MATT: Yeah, I mean, it's as big as he wants it to
be.

02:14:19.536 --> 02:14:23.545
MARISHA: Yeah? Let's do that. Let's go practice.
Let's have a group training session, you guys!

02:14:23.545 --> 02:14:25.393
ASHLEY: Are we learning skills? Group workout?

02:14:25.393 --> 02:14:27.837
SAM: Wait, wait, before we go.

02:14:27.837 --> 02:14:29.065
LAURA: What?

02:14:29.065 --> 02:14:36.652
SAM: I want to go find my daughter. I've got to
leave. Sorry. Bye. Bye!

02:14:36.652 --> 02:14:38.190
MARISHA: You're just leaving?

02:14:38.190 --> 02:14:39.777
SAM: Yeah, I got to go. Sorry.

02:14:39.777 --> 02:14:41.653
MARISHA: Just like that? We got to talk.

02:14:41.653 --> 02:14:42.984
LAURA: Do you want help?

02:14:42.984 --> 02:14:45.755
SAM: Yeah. I do. I'd like Vax to come.

02:14:45.755 --> 02:14:50.213
LIAM: Sure, buddy, sure. Sure, yes, yeah. I'll see
you guys later.

02:14:50.213 --> 02:14:51.925
TRAVIS: We'll wait for you here.

02:14:51.925 --> 02:14:53.975
SAM: Talk, you can start the talk without me,
it'll be fast.

02:14:53.975 --> 02:14:55.533
TRAVIS: Okay, you'll be right back.

02:14:55.533 --> 02:14:58.980
LIAM: I'd like to throw in and say that I don't
want to fight the dragon tomorrow, all right,

02:14:58.980 --> 02:14:59.928
let's go.

02:14:59.928 --> 02:15:01.432
SAM: I do want to, and bye.

02:15:01.432 --> 02:15:02.415
TRAVIS: Copy that.

02:15:02.415 --> 02:15:03.631
MARISHA: We'll train while you guys go!

02:15:03.631 --> 02:15:05.830
MATT: So where are you heading?

02:15:05.830 --> 02:15:11.706
LIAM: Wait, wait. I run back to the door really
quick. Kiki, c'mere c'mere c'mere.

02:15:11.706 --> 02:15:13.357
MARISHA: What what what?

02:15:13.357 --> 02:15:22.713
LIAM: Can you do that mend-y thing still? This is
her, Pom-pom? Pop-Pop, I dunno. Glue the head back on.

02:15:22.713 --> 02:15:24.325
MARISHA: Pop-Pop's? Okay okay okay.

02:15:24.325 --> 02:15:27.228
LIAM: Yeah, glue the head back on. And then I
chase after Scanlan.

02:15:27.228 --> 02:15:30.870
MARISHA: I do the mending on the Sarenrae statue.

02:15:30.870 --> 02:15:39.518
MATT: And in doing so, you reaffirm the
single-piece form that was the small shrine setup

02:15:39.518 --> 02:15:42.657
for the Sarenrae shrine in the home.

02:15:42.657 --> 02:15:47.369
MARISHA: And I want to try a few tricks with the
golem, but throwing that out there. Go ahead.

02:15:47.369 --> 02:15:49.393
MATT: We'll get to that in a moment. Where are you
going?

02:15:49.393 --> 02:15:52.648
SAM: I'm going to where I dropped her off at the
sewers. And I'm hoping that he

02:15:52.648 --> 02:15:54.437
can track or something?

02:15:54.437 --> 02:15:58.172
LAURA: Probably should've brought a ranger with
you, I'm really good at tracking.

02:15:58.172 --> 02:16:00.362
SAM: Fuck! I don't know what you people can do!

02:16:00.362 --> 02:16:03.800
(laughter)

02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:05.330
TRAVIS: Outstanding!

02:16:05.330 --> 02:16:10.431
MATT: So, now as the sun is disappearing right
behind the mountains and nighttime is coming, you

02:16:10.431 --> 02:16:22.937
lead Vax southward through Westruun, dodging
around a few patrolling goliath Herd members, and

02:16:22.937 --> 02:16:27.850
eventually find your way to the alley where the
entrance to the sewer, the protruding entrance

02:16:27.850 --> 02:16:32.740
existed where you left Dr. Dranzel and Kaylie and
a number of survivors that were in the ruined

02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:34.257
Temple of Arathis.

02:16:34.257 --> 02:16:39.081
SAM: Okay, Vax. I know that you are an expert
tracker. Right?

02:16:39.081 --> 02:16:41.644
LIAM: I'm pretty good, I've watched my sister do
it.

02:16:41.644 --> 02:16:43.327
SAM: Wait, you're not the one?

02:16:43.327 --> 02:16:45.065
LIAM: You know that my name is Vax, right?

02:16:45.065 --> 02:16:46.778
SAM: Yeah, I know, aren't you the tracker guy?

02:16:46.778 --> 02:16:48.436
LIAM: Sort of?

02:16:48.436 --> 02:16:51.021
SAM: I don't know, don't you move in the night and
do things?

02:16:51.021 --> 02:16:53.342
LIAM: I do have really good eyes, do you want me
to have a look?

02:16:53.342 --> 02:16:56.451
SAM: Can we go in the sewer and see if we can
figure out where they went?

02:16:56.451 --> 02:16:57.602
LIAM: Let's have a look.

02:16:57.602 --> 02:17:00.942
SAM: They went down here and they went towards the
city wall, that's all I know.

02:17:00.942 --> 02:17:02.071
LIAM: Let's go.

02:17:02.071 --> 02:17:02.941
SAM: Okay.

02:17:02.941 --> 02:17:07.809
MATT: All right. Dranzel closed it behind him, you
go ahead and grab it. Make a strength check.

02:17:07.809 --> 02:17:10.023
SAM: Well, I can't lift anything.

02:17:10.023 --> 02:17:11.598
LIAM: Could we do it together, could I help him,
give him advantage?

02:17:11.598 --> 02:17:12.748
SAM: Whoop! Natural 20.

02:17:12.748 --> 02:17:14.431
(cheering)

02:17:14.431 --> 02:17:17.763
MATT: We'll say between the two of you pulling,
Scanlan most of the weight, you manage to

02:17:17.763 --> 02:17:19.587
(strained sounds).

02:17:19.587 --> 02:17:21.144
SAM: C'mon, pull your weight, man!

02:17:21.144 --> 02:17:25.327
MATT: Pull the grate, it scrapes, and you manage
to haul it off to the side. It's still a difficult

02:17:25.327 --> 02:17:29.586
process but you do manage enough strength in the
two of you to pull it off.

02:17:29.586 --> 02:17:31.753
LIAM: Your forearms are like Popeye,
motherfucker.

02:17:31.753 --> 02:17:35.095
SAM: Yes they are. Years of use.

02:17:35.095 --> 02:17:40.139
MATT: The stench of the sewer immediately hits
your nose, there is a metal ladder that leads down

02:17:40.139 --> 02:17:41.995
into the subterranean area.

02:17:41.995 --> 02:17:45.799
SAM: All right. Where do we go?

02:17:45.799 --> 02:17:51.390
LIAM: I-- well, let's see if she left any-- my
sister looks for tracks. You really should've

02:17:51.390 --> 02:17:53.288
brought my sister. I'm going to check for tracks.

02:17:53.288 --> 02:17:54.581
MATT: Okay, make a survival check.

02:17:54.581 --> 02:17:55.900
LIAM: Survival check, okay, well.

02:17:55.900 --> 02:17:57.390
MATT: Oh wait no, is this for checking for traps
or tracking?

02:17:57.390 --> 02:17:59.537
LIAM: Tracks. Footprints.

02:17:59.537 --> 02:18:00.759
LAURA: Is that what you said?

02:18:00.759 --> 02:18:04.039
LIAM: I said tracks, I'm not looking for traps,
we're in the sewer. Tracks.

02:18:04.039 --> 02:18:05.300
MATT: Yes. Survival.

02:18:05.300 --> 02:18:08.182
SAM: D'you need an article of her clothing for a
scent?

02:18:08.182 --> 02:18:10.736
LIAM: 17. I'm concentrating on the mud.

02:18:10.736 --> 02:18:18.501
MATT: As you're down inside the sewer, there is a
recess in the center of the floor where most of

02:18:18.501 --> 02:18:27.418
the various sludge runs through. There are bits of
runoff from when the rain does pour through, and

02:18:27.418 --> 02:18:34.298
it rains fairly often here in this part of
Tal'Dorei, where bits of mud and compost that get

02:18:34.298 --> 02:18:41.991
caught on the sides are. You do manage to find a
few spots that appear like footsteps, you don't

02:18:41.991 --> 02:18:45.409
know who from, it appears some sort of humanoid's
footsteps, over an area that heads southward.

02:18:45.409 --> 02:18:48.699
LIAM: I hold my foot over one, is it smaller than
mine or is it about the same size?

02:18:48.699 --> 02:18:50.347
MATT: The one you see is about the same size.

02:18:50.347 --> 02:18:54.485
SAM: There were some humanoids, humans with us. We
were traveling with a bunch of people.

02:18:54.485 --> 02:18:59.819
LIAM: Yeah? Okay. Well, I mean, they would've
washed away if they were old, so probably pretty

02:18:59.819 --> 02:19:01.897
new. Let's follow them.

02:19:01.897 --> 02:19:03.468
SAM: You are the expert.

02:19:03.468 --> 02:19:04.865
LIAM: I clearly am.

02:19:04.865 --> 02:19:06.018
(laughter)

02:19:06.018 --> 02:19:07.197
LIAM: Let's go.

02:19:07.197 --> 02:19:08.258
SAM: Shit.

02:19:08.258 --> 02:19:11.346
LIAM: Yeah, I'll lead the way.

02:19:11.346 --> 02:19:15.086
MATT: Okay. You continue, both of you guys make
stealth checks.

02:19:15.086 --> 02:19:16.390
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

02:19:16.390 --> 02:19:21.909
SAM: Seven. I'm just excited!

02:19:21.909 --> 02:19:25.587
TRAVIS: Going to see my daughter!

02:19:25.587 --> 02:19:26.863
LIAM: 33.

02:19:26.863 --> 02:19:35.837
MATT: Okay. You guys continue finding your way,
weaving through the southern area, following the

02:19:35.837 --> 02:19:39.600
tracks they vanish and you'll see a couple
footprints here, and then you guys will lose the

02:19:39.600 --> 02:19:45.665
trail. The scent is terrifying and getting worse
the further south you progress. You do head into

02:19:45.665 --> 02:19:48.741
one central chamber and both of you guys make
perception checks.

02:19:48.741 --> 02:19:51.984
SAM: Huh! 19!

02:19:51.984 --> 02:19:55.341
LIAM: 30.

02:19:55.341 --> 02:19:56.800
SAM: Okay.

02:19:56.800 --> 02:20:03.598
MATT: You both stop in as you immediately see in
the center of this room a large bulbous form that

02:20:03.598 --> 02:20:07.588
is massed in the center. You both stop.

02:20:07.588 --> 02:20:09.793
LIAM: Qu-iet. Quiet.

02:20:09.793 --> 02:20:10.961
SAM: I'm always quiet!

02:20:10.961 --> 02:20:12.395
MATT: It is not moving.

02:20:12.395 --> 02:20:13.499
SAM: Oh. Okay.

02:20:13.499 --> 02:20:19.942
LAURA: Oh my god, did you send your daughter down
to get attacked by a giant bulbous shit?

02:20:19.942 --> 02:20:21.933
SAM: Can we go around it?

02:20:21.933 --> 02:20:25.592
MARISHA: It's true, there were like a bunch of
slimes and stuff down there.

02:20:25.592 --> 02:20:27.884
LIAM: So we're in a larger chamber and it's in the
middle?

02:20:27.884 --> 02:20:33.032
MATT: Yeah, it's like a four-way, four different
platforms or passages merge in the center here,

02:20:33.032 --> 02:20:35.204
where one of the drains leads down into--

02:20:35.204 --> 02:20:38.749
LIAM: And are there any of the footprints left
anywhere?

02:20:38.749 --> 02:20:42.939
MATT: I mean, you do see bits of sludge around,
and there are a number of footprints that are all

02:20:42.939 --> 02:20:46.181
scattered around, some smeared, some skidding.

02:20:46.181 --> 02:20:56.432
LIAM: I reach down and I scoop Scanlan up in
football pose again. Which way do you want to go?

02:20:56.432 --> 02:21:02.728
I can't tell which way. Your daughter. Reach deep,
man.

02:21:02.728 --> 02:21:11.148
SAM: Can I sense which direction the wall of city
is, like do I have any sort of--

02:21:11.148 --> 02:21:12.694
MATT: Make a survival check.

02:21:12.694 --> 02:21:16.054
SAM: Survival, I've never done this before! 13.

02:21:16.054 --> 02:21:24.285
MATT: 13. Keeping track of where you were and the
direction, you gather it's probably that way.

02:21:24.285 --> 02:21:26.107
SAM: Oh! I-- let's go that way!

02:21:26.107 --> 02:21:26.929
LIAM: Shh!

02:21:26.929 --> 02:21:28.400
SAM: (whispering) Sorry, let's go that way.

02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:30.660
LIAM: Don't. Move.

02:21:30.660 --> 02:21:32.312
SAM: All right.

02:21:32.312 --> 02:21:42.897
MATT: As you carefully move past, you look and you
see-- you did encounter one of these entities

02:21:42.897 --> 02:21:51.759
before, when you were tracking down the rakshasa.
It's a terrible swollen creature with tendrils, a

02:21:51.759 --> 02:22:01.178
mouth, it feeds on refuse and rot. This was a
rather swollen and dangerous-looking one. However,

02:22:01.178 --> 02:22:07.247
as you pass by and look, you see a series of
wounds across its body and its lifeblood dripping

02:22:07.247 --> 02:22:09.124
out. This one has been slain.

02:22:09.124 --> 02:22:16.414
LIAM: I'm going to set you down, all right? I
think your daughter done killed a--

02:22:16.414 --> 02:22:17.486
oogedyboogedy.

02:22:17.486 --> 02:22:19.047
SAM: What? How do you know that?

02:22:19.047 --> 02:22:20.455
LIAM: Sit down. It's dead.

02:22:20.455 --> 02:22:21.802
SAM: Oh. Oh, good!

02:22:21.802 --> 02:22:26.169
MATT: Survival check again. You followed the
tracks.

02:22:26.169 --> 02:22:27.783
TRAVIS: Are there any track marks?

02:22:27.783 --> 02:22:30.320
LIAM: 12. I already asked that.

02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:36.581
MATT: The tracks vanish, you're not sure how to
follow a direction.

02:22:36.581 --> 02:22:39.848
LIAM: Is there any blood or ooze walking away, I
mean dripping away from there?

02:22:39.848 --> 02:22:44.808
MATT: I mean, it all congeals in this general
area, most of the central room, the middle area is

02:22:44.808 --> 02:22:49.633
very clustered with slime and goop. There's no
natural flow and there hasn't been a very recent

02:22:49.633 --> 02:22:53.397
rainfall so there isn't a fresh flow of water
through here either.

02:22:53.397 --> 02:22:56.211
LIAM: And where were they going, where did you
tell them to go?

02:22:56.211 --> 02:22:57.886
SAM: Out of town, get out of town.

02:22:57.886 --> 02:23:01.048
LIAM: Do I know where that is, which direction
that is down here?

02:23:01.048 --> 02:23:03.921
MATT: I mean, based on where you're going, you
guys can follow that path. And we'll say for the

02:23:03.921 --> 02:23:11.759
sake of brevity you eventually find your way to a
portion of the sewer, dodging a few shady-looking

02:23:11.759 --> 02:23:17.985
areas to where a final grate leads out into the
night. Because it is night at this point in time.

02:23:17.985 --> 02:23:27.700
It's a large ten-foot-tall circular grate. If you
look, the bars are actually bent open and it leads

02:23:27.700 --> 02:23:33.233
outward, the liquid from the sewage now spills out
into this small ravine in the very southern

02:23:33.233 --> 02:23:36.209
portion of Westruun. And leads out into--

02:23:36.209 --> 02:23:38.513
LIAM: Sort of like this? Or is it?

02:23:38.513 --> 02:23:39.911
MATT: No, it's up like this, it's vertical.

02:23:39.911 --> 02:23:42.863
LIAM: Vertical. And what do we see past the bars?

02:23:42.863 --> 02:23:45.396
MATT: You see the open plains south of Westruun.

02:23:45.396 --> 02:23:49.927
SAM: No sign of tracks, anyone huddled for
safety?

02:23:49.927 --> 02:23:55.264
MATT: I mean, looking around you can see a few
footprints, scattered footprints, you can make a

02:23:55.264 --> 02:23:58.157
survival check.

02:23:58.157 --> 02:23:59.776
SAM: Pff. Ten.

02:23:59.776 --> 02:24:00.782
LIAM: 12.

02:24:00.782 --> 02:24:02.668
MATT: Ten? Nothing that specifically catches your
attention.

02:24:02.668 --> 02:24:04.731
LIAM: I think she got outta here, pal.

02:24:04.731 --> 02:24:06.492
SAM: Balls.

02:24:06.492 --> 02:24:08.566
LIAM: But she's not here.

02:24:08.566 --> 02:24:10.812
SAM: That's true.

02:24:10.812 --> 02:24:11.980
LIAM: She's better off.

02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:18.347
SAM: All right. All right. Sorry, wild goose
chase.

02:24:18.347 --> 02:24:22.369
LIAM: No, no, don't worry about it. You want to
talk about it?

02:24:22.369 --> 02:24:34.298
SAM: No, no. I just don't know when I'll see her
again, so. I'll find her again. That's all. It'll

02:24:34.298 --> 02:24:35.526
be good.

02:24:35.526 --> 02:24:37.005
LIAM: I believe that, too.

02:24:37.005 --> 02:24:50.009
SAM: Yeah. Oh, and hey. Thank you. Back at the
sphinx. Your sister was unconscious, and you dove

02:24:50.009 --> 02:24:56.821
in to save me. That was very nice.

02:24:56.821 --> 02:25:04.057
LIAM: I knew she would be taken care of, and I
wasn't sure about you.

02:25:04.057 --> 02:25:08.018
SAM: Because you love me?

02:25:08.018 --> 02:25:15.214
LIAM: You're very entertaining and I would be sad
to see you go.

02:25:15.214 --> 02:25:26.216
SAM: Well, I owe you one. Forever. And I hate to
say it, but I feel terrible about it, but I think

02:25:26.216 --> 02:25:32.728
I might've killed a couple of civilians because I
feel like I owe you some, some help.

02:25:32.728 --> 02:25:36.220
LIAM: What do you mean?

02:25:36.220 --> 02:25:44.961
SAM: Well, I was in the big fight back there, I
could've hurt you or the civilians, but I decided

02:25:44.961 --> 02:25:51.497
to hurt the civilians, because I've got to protect
you, because you protected me.

02:25:51.497 --> 02:26:02.793
LIAM: Well-- there's no right or wrong, but next
time, I'll be all right. You help people more in

02:26:02.793 --> 02:26:04.770
need than me, and I'll be all right.

02:26:04.770 --> 02:26:06.904
SAM: All right. Next time.

02:26:06.904 --> 02:26:11.852
LIAM: I don't know any of your fancy, you know,
fluh-duh-duh. But--

02:26:11.852 --> 02:26:13.611
SAM: Well, I'm no ranger like you.

02:26:13.611 --> 02:26:14.812
(laughter)

02:26:14.812 --> 02:26:21.924
LIAM: There is no ranger like me. This is stupid,
we should go back.

02:26:21.924 --> 02:26:23.753
SAM: Through the sewers again?

02:26:23.753 --> 02:26:31.001
LIAM: Yeah. I mean, we don't have Big Man with us
and I don't want to run into any of his third

02:26:31.001 --> 02:26:32.789
cousins or whatever, so yeah.

02:26:32.789 --> 02:26:35.643
SAM: All right. I'll lead the way.

02:26:35.643 --> 02:26:37.155
LIAM: Might as well.

02:26:37.155 --> 02:26:39.812
MATT: Eventually you guys make your way back.

02:26:39.812 --> 02:26:41.643
TALIESIN: Not going to make them roll survival to
get back?

02:26:41.643 --> 02:26:43.910
LAURA: You guys are lost forever in the sewers.

02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:47.545
MATT: Little roundabout, but they get there
eventually, they return to the mansion--

02:26:47.545 --> 02:26:50.607
MARISHA: Status gained: fall into a pile of shit.
Never to get out.

02:26:50.607 --> 02:26:59.184
MATT: Smelling awful. All right, so. You wanted to go
ahead and do some exercises with Fassbender.

02:26:59.184 --> 02:27:01.760
MARISHA: I do want to do some exercises with
Fassbender.

02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:03.343
LAURA: (laughs) Who doesn't?

02:27:03.343 --> 02:27:07.726
MARISHA: Who doesn't want to do exercises with
Fassbender? Abs of stone, that Fassbender.

02:27:07.726 --> 02:27:09.363
LIAM: P90X with Fassbender?

02:27:09.363 --> 02:27:11.219
(laughter)

02:27:11.219 --> 02:27:15.893
MARISHA: Okay, he's not invisible anymore, right?
You dropped that, I'm assuming he dropped-- sure.

02:27:15.893 --> 02:27:17.371
MATT: That's faded by now, yeah.

02:27:17.371 --> 02:27:29.959
TRAVIS: Ohh. I get it. Makes so much sense. Shit.
He is huge. Fuck. Now I get it, all right, he's

02:27:29.959 --> 02:27:31.221
with us. Got it.

02:27:31.221 --> 02:27:32.423
MARISHA: He is with us, yeah.

02:27:32.423 --> 02:27:33.432
TRAVIS: Understand.

02:27:33.432 --> 02:27:37.179
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, oh, sorry. Grog, Fassbender.
Fassbender, Grog.

02:27:37.179 --> 02:27:38.697
TRAVIS: His name is Fassbender?

02:27:38.697 --> 02:27:40.023
ASHLEY: I call him Fluffy.

02:27:40.023 --> 02:27:41.846
TRAVIS: Fluffy it is!

02:27:41.846 --> 02:27:46.778
MARISHA: I'm terrible at naming things, I just go
with whatever the first person shouts out.

02:27:46.778 --> 02:27:48.742
LAURA: That's a lie because I said Spike.

02:27:48.742 --> 02:27:53.228
MARISHA: Oh, you did say Spike. We overruled it
with Fassbender.

02:27:53.228 --> 02:27:54.969
(laughter)

02:27:54.969 --> 02:27:57.232
TALIESIN: She goes with the second thing that
everybody shouts out.

02:27:57.232 --> 02:28:01.320
MATT: Too late now. It's in stone.

02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:03.319
TALIESIN: Literally.

02:28:03.319 --> 02:28:06.615
LIAM: It's like an improv show. "Salty
McFucknuts!"

02:28:06.615 --> 02:28:08.763
(laughter)

02:28:08.763 --> 02:28:10.555
MARISHA: Spike, ehhh, not that one.

02:28:10.555 --> 02:28:13.372
MATT: It basically is, yeah.

02:28:13.372 --> 02:28:28.186
MARISHA: Okay, so first I say, Fassbender, run!
And I want to see how fast he can go.

02:28:28.186 --> 02:28:34.205
MATT: And he runs about the same speed you do, I
mean as far as its bigger steps, but it gets about

02:28:34.205 --> 02:28:35.474
the same distance.

02:28:35.474 --> 02:28:43.018
MARISHA: Okay, and I say, Fassbender, punch Grog!
He's used to this, Grog's fine with it.

02:28:43.018 --> 02:28:44.228
MATT: Do you do anything?

02:28:44.228 --> 02:28:45.801
TRAVIS: No, yeah, I totally take it.

02:28:45.801 --> 02:28:48.252
MARISHA: This is how we train with Grog. It's
fine.

02:28:48.252 --> 02:28:50.447
LAURA: You're healed, you're healed up?

02:28:50.447 --> 02:28:51.883
TRAVIS: Enough.

02:28:51.883 --> 02:28:57.856
MATT: The golem pulls back, whoosh, swings at you
with a giant fist. That is a 19.

02:28:57.856 --> 02:29:06.682
TRAVIS: Yeah, that-- wait. Well, I took off--
yeah, I did take off my Bracers of Defense, so

02:29:06.682 --> 02:29:08.985
that hits.

02:29:08.985 --> 02:29:21.460
MATT: All right. Whack. Right square to the side
of the face and jaw, you take, from the impact of

02:29:21.460 --> 02:29:30.421
its giant battering-ram-like arm, 24 points of
bludgeoning damage.

02:29:30.421 --> 02:29:32.166
ALL: Oh!

02:29:32.166 --> 02:29:33.915
MATT: You're not raging, so it's not halved.

02:29:33.915 --> 02:29:38.759
TRAVIS: Okay. Tit for tat, bitch. And I swing back
with the Titanstone Knuckles and punch Fassbender

02:29:38.759 --> 02:29:39.899
in the face.

02:29:39.899 --> 02:29:41.193
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.

02:29:41.193 --> 02:29:44.407
LAURA: Do we know if we can heal him once we
damage him?

02:29:44.407 --> 02:29:45.548
MARISHA: We'll find out.

02:29:45.548 --> 02:29:47.559
TRAVIS: 28.

02:29:47.559 --> 02:29:56.778
MATT: That hits. So you do one plus the plus seven
strength damage to it. So eight points of--

02:29:56.778 --> 02:29:59.864
TRAVIS: Of the four or the six, because it's my
fist?

02:29:59.864 --> 02:30:03.873
MATT: Huh? Well, it's not a save, your fists for
this because you're not a tavern brawler and we're

02:30:03.941 --> 02:30:08.409
saying because you're not like on even ground with
the other guy. You're doing boom, one point of

02:30:08.409 --> 02:30:14.852
damage from the punch plus seven for the strength.
So eight points of damage from the crack as the

02:30:14.852 --> 02:30:21.075
fist hits. It does cause like a crack where the
impact hits, a little bit.

02:30:21.075 --> 02:30:24.406
MARISHA: I say, okay, all right, enough hitting
each other, enough of that.

02:30:24.406 --> 02:30:28.971
TRAVIS: Well, hold on, we were just getting warmed
up, I mean, this is where the game starts, you

02:30:28.971 --> 02:30:32.119
know, it's like, P-I-N-G and then you really start
playing.

02:30:32.119 --> 02:30:33.964
LAURA: Ping? You can--

02:30:33.964 --> 02:30:35.698
TRAVIS: It's a song.

02:30:35.698 --> 02:30:45.497
MARISHA: There's some other questions first, other
questions first. I cast Call Lightning.

02:30:45.581 --> 02:30:47.080
MATT: Okay.

02:30:47.080 --> 02:30:50.521
TALIESIN: I'm going to get in the way of this,
just for fun.

02:30:50.521 --> 02:30:52.286
SAM: Indoors, by the way.

02:30:52.286 --> 02:30:56.717
MARISHA: And I just, it's fine, I bring down a
bolt of lightning on a dummy, and then see if I

02:30:56.717 --> 02:31:03.341
can also command Fassbender to punch a dummy.

02:31:03.341 --> 02:31:10.002
MATT: Okay. Bolt of lightning hits a dummy, the
dummy is shattered. As you command Fassbender,

02:31:10.002 --> 02:31:14.635
Fassbender leaps forward at another dummy, whoosh,
giant haymaker and causes the dummy to explode

02:31:14.635 --> 02:31:17.245
into a bunch of fluff and cloth.

02:31:17.245 --> 02:31:20.064
MARISHA: So would we say that would be like a
bonus action, what I just did?

02:31:20.064 --> 02:31:21.436
MATT: No.

02:31:21.436 --> 02:31:24.090
MARISHA: No? It was an action for each?

02:31:24.090 --> 02:31:30.366
MATT: I mean, you have to focus on it, yeah. I
mean, you can give it-- you have an action to

02:31:30.366 --> 02:31:32.616
give it a command, and it'll continue the command
as it goes.

02:31:32.616 --> 02:31:36.890
TALIESIN: So once it's set in that motion, it'll
continue to kill that thing.

02:31:36.890 --> 02:31:44.511
MARISHA: Okay. So then theoretically I can have a
concentration spell up and be like, kill that

02:31:44.511 --> 02:31:46.471
thing, and they won't overlap?

02:31:46.471 --> 02:31:48.074
MATT: Hmm, let's see.

02:31:48.074 --> 02:31:51.446
LIAM: Y'know, while he looks that up, let me point
out that when I punched Percy in the face, there

02:31:51.446 --> 02:31:53.175
were zero points of hitpoint damage.

02:31:53.175 --> 02:31:55.579
(laughter)

02:31:55.579 --> 02:31:57.739
SAM: Hey now. Rangers aren't very strong.

02:31:57.739 --> 02:32:00.243
LIAM: Yes, yes, I did punch him.

02:32:00.243 --> 02:32:05.305
TALIESIN: I want to check by the way, Liam, are
you imagining the eighties-era X-Men danger room

02:32:05.305 --> 02:32:07.438
right now too, with like the hoops and the bars.

02:32:07.438 --> 02:32:09.228
ALL: Ohh!

02:32:09.228 --> 02:32:12.728
LIAM: Yeah, metal rods, and Nightcrawler going--

02:32:12.728 --> 02:32:17.562
MATT: It takes an action to focus and give it a
new command.

02:32:17.562 --> 02:32:18.981
MARISHA: A new command.

02:32:18.981 --> 02:32:23.250
MATT: Yes. Once it is commanded, it will continue
to do it until told otherwise or it completes

02:32:23.250 --> 02:32:25.297
whatever task it was given.

02:32:25.297 --> 02:32:30.675
MARISHA: It's not a concentration to keep up that
command. So, like-- keep fighting the dragon until

02:32:30.675 --> 02:32:34.714
it hits the ground would theoretically be one
command that would keep going?

02:32:34.714 --> 02:32:37.132
MATT: Based on your experience with it so far,
theoretically it should work.

02:32:37.132 --> 02:32:38.424
MARISHA: Okay.

02:32:38.424 --> 02:32:40.665
LIAM: (robotic voice) Whatever Keyleth wants,
Keyleth gets.

02:32:40.665 --> 02:32:46.740
MARISHA: Thank you, Speak and Spell. We found out
if it can talk?

02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:48.374
TALIESIN: Ask a question.

02:32:48.374 --> 02:32:49.659
MARISHA: Fassbender.

02:32:49.659 --> 02:32:52.555
(laughter)

02:32:52.555 --> 02:33:02.031
MARISHA: Fassbender. How many years old are you?
Hold up-- hold on, how old are you?

02:33:02.031 --> 02:33:05.025
MATT: No response.

02:33:05.025 --> 02:33:06.977
TALIESIN: All right, this is good, we're finding
out its intelligence level.

02:33:06.977 --> 02:33:15.392
MARISHA: Can you gesture to me with your fingers
and tell me how many years old you are?

02:33:15.392 --> 02:33:17.008
(whispers) I don't think he's listening.

02:33:17.008 --> 02:33:18.666
TALIESIN: It may not be smart enough to know
that.

02:33:18.666 --> 02:33:19.717
MARISHA: He's distracted.

02:33:19.717 --> 02:33:24.615
MATT: Yeah, there, it's-- no response.

02:33:24.615 --> 02:33:30.660
TALIESIN: So it doesn't know anything, that's
good. Let's find out if it can, does it have any

02:33:30.660 --> 02:33:36.910
magical properties beyond punching, can it, tell
it to use magic.

02:33:36.910 --> 02:33:46.244
MARISHA: Okay. Hey, Fassbender. Cast a spell on
Percy.

02:33:46.244 --> 02:33:50.395
(laughter)

02:33:50.395 --> 02:33:52.074
SAM: Death's eye.

02:33:52.074 --> 02:33:53.782
TALIESIN: And then I die.

02:33:53.782 --> 02:33:56.059
LIAM: Disintegrate beam, straight on.

02:33:56.059 --> 02:33:58.618
TALIESIN: And then you dye a blue streak in your
hair and everything goes fine.

02:33:58.618 --> 02:34:04.939
MATT: It turns over, brings its hands up like
this-- make a wisdom saving throw.

02:34:04.939 --> 02:34:06.583
SAM: Oh my god.

02:34:06.583 --> 02:34:09.984
MARISHA: Well look, I wanted a live test subject.

02:34:09.984 --> 02:34:11.727
TALIESIN: No, no, I'm with you, I'm with you.

02:34:11.727 --> 02:34:13.989
TRAVIS: That's my designation.

02:34:13.989 --> 02:34:16.234
TALIESIN: Natural. One.

02:34:16.234 --> 02:34:17.853
LAURA: Oh no!

02:34:17.853 --> 02:34:20.174
MATT: (laughs) You feel like--

02:34:20.174 --> 02:34:21.648
MARISHA: Hey! To Percy!

02:34:21.648 --> 02:34:23.062
TALIESIN: No no no, it's happening.

02:34:23.062 --> 02:34:26.655
MATT: You've been near explosions before, not like
super close but big enough where you feel like the

02:34:26.655 --> 02:34:32.680
concussive wave from a distance, not enough to
harm you, but enough to like, send you off your

02:34:32.680 --> 02:34:37.279
balance for a moment. You feel that impact, and as
you fall onto your back foot, time around you

02:34:37.279 --> 02:34:43.174
seems to be moving faster that you'd expect, and
(slow-mo voice) you find your motion sluggish.

02:34:43.174 --> 02:34:44.939
SAM: Oh. That's Slow.

02:34:44.939 --> 02:34:49.145
MATT: (slow-mo voice) And you really have a hard
time really moving--

02:34:49.145 --> 02:34:50.889
MARISHA: That's awesome!

02:34:50.889 --> 02:34:54.161
TALIESIN: (slow-mo voice) This-- put--

02:34:54.161 --> 02:34:55.574
ASHLEY: It's-- you're in slow-mo!

02:34:55.574 --> 02:34:57.404
TALIESIN: (slow-mo voice) --the candle--

02:34:57.404 --> 02:34:59.141
MARISHA: Percy, you're in slow-mo! You're slow-mo,
Percy!

02:34:59.141 --> 02:35:00.392
TALIESIN: (slow-mo voice) --back.

02:35:00.392 --> 02:35:01.575
MARISHA: It's amazing!

02:35:01.575 --> 02:35:02.669
LAURA: How do we fix him?

02:35:02.669 --> 02:35:03.935
MARISHA: It'll wear off.

02:35:03.935 --> 02:35:06.340
MATT: Make another wisdom saving throw.

02:35:06.340 --> 02:35:09.610
LIAM: How will he do zingers now?

02:35:09.610 --> 02:35:15.351
TALIESIN: Wisdom, where are we-- 16.

02:35:15.351 --> 02:35:17.042
LIAM: (slow-mo voice) We're slow.

02:35:17.042 --> 02:35:19.335
MATT: (slow-mo voice) Not really changing.

02:35:19.335 --> 02:35:20.777
LAURA: Oh no.

02:35:20.777 --> 02:35:23.243
MARISHA: All right, Fassbender, can you drop
this?

02:35:23.243 --> 02:35:25.192
LIAM: Bet he can't.

02:35:25.192 --> 02:35:28.710
TALIESIN: You asked him a question as opposed to
telling him to do it.

02:35:28.710 --> 02:35:30.691
MARISHA: Fassbender, drop the spell.

02:35:30.691 --> 02:35:38.143
MATT: (slow-mo voice) No apparent change in Percy.
(normal voice) He stands there.

02:35:38.143 --> 02:35:39.894
LAURA: Oh no.

02:35:39.894 --> 02:35:47.765
MARISHA: It'll wear off. Okay. Fassbender, do you
know any other spells, and if so, cast them at the

02:35:47.765 --> 02:35:49.577
dummy this time.

02:35:49.577 --> 02:35:52.917
MATT: Looks at the dummy, looks back at you.

02:35:52.917 --> 02:36:02.150
MARISHA: I go up to Fassbender and I cast Stone
Shape on his chest and see if I can repair that crack.

02:36:02.150 --> 02:36:12.027
Actually, before I do that, can I do a
level one Cure Wounds to see if I can heal him

02:36:12.027 --> 02:36:13.889
first? Okay.

02:36:13.889 --> 02:36:16.298
MATT: Go ahead and roll for that.

02:36:16.298 --> 02:36:18.527
MARISHA: Do I roll a d20 for it?

02:36:18.527 --> 02:36:22.286
SAM: He's talking to a whale right now somewhere.

02:36:22.286 --> 02:36:23.799
MARISHA: Eight points.

02:36:23.799 --> 02:36:27.282
TALIESIN: (slow-mo) hate-- you--

02:36:27.282 --> 02:36:29.289
(laughter)

02:36:29.289 --> 02:36:30.955
LIAM: Tell us all about the nature of politics.

02:36:30.955 --> 02:36:34.480
LAURA: Just think, the fun thing is, I think
you're aging much slower than the rest of us.

02:36:34.480 --> 02:36:38.040
MATT: Okay. This is, this, hmm.

02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:41.656
TALIESIN: (laughs) This is the most torturous
thing ever.

02:36:41.656 --> 02:36:49.375
MATT: So you go ahead and reach out and touch it,
and the healing magic seeps up into the crack that

02:36:49.375 --> 02:36:52.146
Grog left behind, and the crack fuses shut.

02:36:52.146 --> 02:36:55.314
LAURA: That's cool, that's cool.

02:36:55.314 --> 02:36:56.654
MATT: For how much was the total?

02:36:56.654 --> 02:36:57.567
MARISHA: Eight points.

02:36:57.567 --> 02:36:59.463
MATT: Yeah, fuses shut entirely, it's like there
was no crack.

02:36:59.463 --> 02:37:02.270
MARISHA: So he gets healed by a heal--

02:37:02.270 --> 02:37:06.059
MATT: About a minute passes, and then you come
back to your normal pace.

02:37:06.059 --> 02:37:07.656
TALIESIN: No, it's-- no, it's good.

02:37:07.656 --> 02:37:10.109
MARISHA: How was that, how did that feel? Was it
frustrating?

02:37:10.109 --> 02:37:10.903
TALIESIN: Yes!

02:37:10.903 --> 02:37:12.149
MARISHA: Good, good.

02:37:12.149 --> 02:37:14.183
(laughter)

02:37:14.183 --> 02:37:15.381
TALIESIN: Can it--

02:37:15.381 --> 02:37:16.698
MARISHA: Thank you, that's all I need.

02:37:16.698 --> 02:37:18.101
TALIESIN: Can it fly?

02:37:18.101 --> 02:37:20.441
MARISHA: Ooh. Fassbender, can you-- I don't think
he can fly.

02:37:20.441 --> 02:37:21.451
TALIESIN: Just try it.

02:37:21.451 --> 02:37:22.813
MARISHA: Fassbender, can you fly?

02:37:22.813 --> 02:37:23.656
LIAM: Tell it.

02:37:23.656 --> 02:37:27.791
MARISHA: Fly, Fassbender, fly.

02:37:27.791 --> 02:37:30.499
TALIESIN: How high did it jump?

02:37:30.499 --> 02:37:32.799
MARISHA: How high is it jumping?

02:37:32.799 --> 02:37:38.890
MATT: It's getting six feet off the ground
vertically. And then landing with a heavy impact

02:37:38.890 --> 02:37:42.810
each time, causing these divots to
continuously push into the ground.

02:37:42.810 --> 02:37:44.897
LAURA: Ooh, I wonder if it can like earthquake.

02:37:44.897 --> 02:37:51.128
MARISHA: Okay, I Stone Shape, I take a chunk of
the wall and I Stone Shape a boulder. And I hand

02:37:51.128 --> 02:37:53.872
it to him. And I say, throw it at that target.

02:37:53.872 --> 02:37:55.450
MATT: Tiny little boulder.

02:37:55.450 --> 02:37:56.779
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:37:56.779 --> 02:38:01.694
MATT: It hits the target, the stone shatters
across it.

02:38:01.694 --> 02:38:03.179
MARISHA: So his aim's pretty good.

02:38:03.179 --> 02:38:04.095
TALIESIN: All right.

02:38:04.095 --> 02:38:05.228
LAURA: Nice.

02:38:05.228 --> 02:38:09.184
MARISHA: And then I go, Fassbender, high-five.

02:38:09.184 --> 02:38:12.157
Yeah.

02:38:12.157 --> 02:38:14.632
MATT: You take two points of bludgeoning damage.

02:38:14.632 --> 02:38:15.646
MARISHA: Ahh.

02:38:15.646 --> 02:38:17.085
MATT: Unable to control its force.

02:38:17.085 --> 02:38:20.426
MARISHA: Mm. Yeah. You're my buddy, Fassbender.

02:38:20.426 --> 02:38:25.085
TALIESIN: Out of idle curiosity, two last
important things that I would recommend.

02:38:25.085 --> 02:38:26.141
MARISHA: Okay.

02:38:26.141 --> 02:38:33.105
TALIESIN: Perhaps, Fassbender, go into recharge
mode? Or sleep mode? Perhaps? So that maybe it can

02:38:33.105 --> 02:38:40.866
regain some of its magic ability, which it might
burn through? And two, and I'm surprised that I'm

02:38:40.866 --> 02:38:45.123
the one to mention this, but we should
double-check to make sure that that thing isn't

02:38:45.123 --> 02:38:47.443
doing anything strange to your head.

02:38:47.443 --> 02:38:52.179
MATT: For the record, while this has happened,
Mort, who's been following you guys around because

02:38:52.179 --> 02:38:55.612
it's not concentration, the circlet that he was
carrying, the one that you previously had, hit the

02:38:55.612 --> 02:38:58.069
ground. And is lying there on the ground.

02:38:58.069 --> 02:38:59.616
TALIESIN: I'm going to pick that up.

02:38:59.616 --> 02:39:00.709
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:39:00.709 --> 02:39:02.409
TALIESIN: All right. It's very nice.

02:39:02.409 --> 02:39:12.421
MARISHA: Thank you. It's very old. Okay,
Fassbender. Rest.

02:39:12.421 --> 02:39:20.339
MATT: The eyes go to a very, very dull glow, its
form tends to slightly hunch forward in the

02:39:20.339 --> 02:39:24.043
position it was at rest when you found it in the
basement, seems to have gone into some sort of a rest state.

02:39:24.043 --> 02:39:26.153
MARISHA: Okay.

02:39:26.153 --> 02:39:29.008
TALIESIN: Take that off for a bit? Maybe?

02:39:29.008 --> 02:39:30.889
MARISHA: But I like it--

02:39:30.889 --> 02:39:32.814
LAURA: Try taking it off, Kiki.

02:39:32.814 --> 02:39:34.325
MARISHA: It's my friend.

02:39:34.325 --> 02:39:35.984
TALIESIN: It'll be your friend in the morning.

02:39:35.984 --> 02:39:38.094
MARISHA: Okay. I take it off.

02:39:38.094 --> 02:39:42.891
MATT: As you reach up, you go to pull it off your
head--

02:39:42.891 --> 02:39:44.466
and it slides off without a problem.

02:39:44.466 --> 02:39:45.921
(shouting)

02:39:45.921 --> 02:39:47.570
LAURA: I am going to throw something at you!

02:39:47.570 --> 02:39:49.605
TRAVIS: That's like the fifth time today and it's
so good!

02:39:49.605 --> 02:39:51.279
ASHLEY: You sneaky-sneaky.

02:39:51.279 --> 02:39:53.384
TRAVIS: No, like a good horror movie. Fakeouts.

02:39:53.384 --> 02:39:54.894
ASHLEY: As you take it off your head--

02:39:54.894 --> 02:39:57.592
SAM: --your eyes start to bleed.

02:39:57.592 --> 02:39:59.019
MARISHA: I take it off.

02:39:59.019 --> 02:40:03.611
TALIESIN: Seems all right.

02:40:03.611 --> 02:40:06.481
MARISHA: Do I look funny?

02:40:06.481 --> 02:40:09.676
TALIESIN: More than normal? Oh, no, you don't look
different.

02:40:09.676 --> 02:40:11.493
MARISHA: You're a dick.

02:40:11.493 --> 02:40:15.493
TALIESIN: I know. Well, you made a robot cast a
spell on me. An automaton, I suppose.

02:40:15.493 --> 02:40:17.422
MARISHA: Mm, you earned it.

02:40:17.422 --> 02:40:19.048
TALIESIN: That's fair.

02:40:19.048 --> 02:40:24.191
MATT: So, while this is happening-- you guys.

02:40:24.191 --> 02:40:28.734
TRAVIS: Can I turn to Pike and say like, look at
what I got!

02:40:28.734 --> 02:40:30.460
ASHLEY: These are cool!

02:40:30.460 --> 02:40:34.948
TRAVIS: Yeah, right? I don't even feel it. It's
like nothing.

02:40:34.948 --> 02:40:35.911
ASHLEY: You don't?

02:40:35.911 --> 02:40:36.828
TRAVIS: Nope.

02:40:36.828 --> 02:40:37.798
ASHLEY: You don't even feel that?

02:40:37.798 --> 02:40:38.852
TRAVIS: No, nothing.

02:40:38.852 --> 02:40:39.888
ASHLEY: Wow!

02:40:39.888 --> 02:40:45.931
TRAVIS: Well, look. The bloodaxe, right, I've
known this weapon for many, many years, and I

02:40:45.931 --> 02:40:50.492
wanted you to be here when I did this. (whispers)
Can you hear me?

02:40:50.492 --> 02:40:53.535
ASHLEY: Did it say anything to you?

02:40:53.535 --> 02:40:55.427
MATT: No response.

02:40:55.427 --> 02:40:58.534
TRAVIS: No. Which is cool, right?

02:40:58.534 --> 02:41:02.157
ASHLEY: Okay, this is good, this is good, this is
an improvement from your last weapon.

02:41:02.157 --> 02:41:07.887
TRAVIS: Yep, better. Can you tell if it's evil?

02:41:07.887 --> 02:41:09.619
ASHLEY: Bad? Yeah.

02:41:09.619 --> 02:41:12.285
TALIESIN: How awful a person am I?

02:41:12.285 --> 02:41:16.796
MARISHA: You're pretty awful, from what I'm slowly
beginning to learn about you, Percy.

02:41:16.796 --> 02:41:22.638
MATT: What are you doing? There's, the level, what
spell do you have prepared that'll help with this,

02:41:22.638 --> 02:41:24.126
if any?

02:41:24.126 --> 02:41:27.534
That you have prepared.

02:41:27.534 --> 02:41:32.153
ASHLEY: Where'd it go, where'd it go, it was
right-- Can I--

02:41:32.153 --> 02:41:39.293
MATT: There's a level one spell, Detect Good and
Evil, if you have that prepared, that would detect

02:41:39.293 --> 02:41:40.482
for an evil entity.

02:41:40.482 --> 02:41:42.195
LAURA: Do you have Identify?

02:41:42.195 --> 02:41:43.488
TRAVIS: No.

02:41:43.488 --> 02:41:48.698
MATT: Identify is more of an arcane-based.

02:41:48.698 --> 02:41:50.341
TRAVIS: What do you think?

02:41:50.341 --> 02:41:53.831
MATT: That would be like Scanlan or any other
arcane casters you would know.

02:41:53.831 --> 02:41:55.672
ASHLEY: Can I perception check it?

02:41:55.672 --> 02:41:57.586
LAURA: Do you have Identify?

02:41:57.586 --> 02:41:59.165
SAM: I'm not there.

02:41:59.165 --> 02:42:01.399
LAURA: I'm asking you, not you.

02:42:01.399 --> 02:42:03.459
ASHLEY: Insight check it, can I--

02:42:03.459 --> 02:42:04.935
SAM: You'll have to butter me up first.

02:42:04.935 --> 02:42:09.423
MATT: I mean, it's hard to insight check something
that's not living from what you can tell. There's

02:42:09.423 --> 02:42:11.632
no communication, there's nothing, it just looks
like an axe.

02:42:11.632 --> 02:42:15.318
ASHLEY: I'll learn that spell and I'll check it
later.

02:42:15.318 --> 02:42:17.038
TRAVIS: Oh, you can't tell anything?

02:42:17.038 --> 02:42:23.139
ASHLEY: I can't tell anything right now. It looks
pretty normal. And it's a good sign that it's not

02:42:23.139 --> 02:42:24.470
talking to you.

02:42:24.470 --> 02:42:28.365
TRAVIS: Right. So we're already in a better place
than we were before.

02:42:28.365 --> 02:42:31.438
ASHLEY: Yeah. And they look really cool.

02:42:31.438 --> 02:42:41.364
TRAVIS: They do. Hey, wait, keep holding it for a
second. Can I walk over to the wall? Can I punch

02:42:41.364 --> 02:42:42.566
the wall?

02:42:42.566 --> 02:42:43.701
MATT: Sure.

02:42:43.701 --> 02:42:45.228
TRAVIS: I'd like to punch the wall.

02:42:45.228 --> 02:42:46.903
LIAM: It's like our first game ever.

02:42:46.903 --> 02:42:48.716
MARISHA: (Grog voice) I'd like to punch the wall.

02:42:48.716 --> 02:42:57.308
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.

02:42:57.308 --> 02:42:58.866
TRAVIS: Wait-- 50.

02:42:58.866 --> 02:43:00.453
LAURA: Wait, that's damage.

02:43:00.453 --> 02:43:01.928
MATT: Wait, no, just damage is doubled.

02:43:01.928 --> 02:43:04.263
TRAVIS: Oh, just damage. 25. 25.

02:43:04.263 --> 02:43:10.510
MATT: That was pretty funny. All right. So. As you
rear back, your fist slams into the stonework here

02:43:10.510 --> 02:43:16.475
of your magnificent mansion, the stonework
shatters, eight, up to 16 points of damage from the

02:43:16.475 --> 02:43:22.178
sheer punch against the wall, the stone sends a
crack through that actually pierces to the top of

02:43:22.178 --> 02:43:26.426
the rather large 25-foot ceiling here in the
training area that has been crafted by Scanlan.

02:43:26.426 --> 02:43:33.383
Stones tumble and hit the ground, a bunch of it,
plaster and pieces fall and hit the area around

02:43:33.383 --> 02:43:37.171
you, causing a small pile of wreckage. Pretty
solid punch.

02:43:37.171 --> 02:43:39.365
ASHLEY: Whoa!

02:43:39.365 --> 02:43:42.991
TRAVIS: I remember being little and Kevdak went
and punched a boulder and it went like

02:43:42.991 --> 02:43:44.815
(stone shattering) and split in half.

02:43:44.815 --> 02:43:46.494
ASHLEY: Whoa, and you just did it with the hands.

02:43:46.494 --> 02:43:48.666
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going to be busting balls big
time.

02:43:48.666 --> 02:43:49.653
ASHLEY: Can I swing the axe?

02:43:49.653 --> 02:43:51.511
TRAVIS: Yeah, at me?

02:43:51.511 --> 02:43:55.531
ASHLEY: No! At the dummy. I'm going to try it. I'm
going to try swinging the axe at the dummy.

02:43:55.531 --> 02:43:58.383
MATT: It sticks into it.

02:43:58.383 --> 02:44:01.406
TRAVIS: Good swing!

02:44:01.406 --> 02:44:03.099
(laughter)

02:44:03.099 --> 02:44:04.993
MATT: You're not as strong as him per se,
you're--

02:44:04.993 --> 02:44:06.496
TRAVIS: Vicious, vicious. Oh wait--

02:44:06.496 --> 02:44:07.705
MATT: Your strength is 13, right?

02:44:07.705 --> 02:44:08.694
ASHLEY: What's that?

02:44:08.694 --> 02:44:09.751
MATT: Your strength is 13, right?

02:44:09.751 --> 02:44:12.664
ASHLEY: My strength?

02:44:12.664 --> 02:44:13.721
MATT: Strength is 13, right?

02:44:13.721 --> 02:44:15.377
ASHLEY: 19.

02:44:15.377 --> 02:44:17.135
MATT: It's not, because you haven't put the
gauntlets on.

02:44:17.135 --> 02:44:19.198
ASHLEY: I didn't, I don't think I erased that.

02:44:19.198 --> 02:44:26.241
TRAVIS: Well hold on, I had to take the Gauntlets
of Ogre Power off, do you want them back? Now, I

02:44:26.241 --> 02:44:32.713
think you have to give 'em up for the boots, but
it's your pick, it's a kite-- or you can be a monstah!

02:44:32.713 --> 02:44:34.938
ASHLEY: I want to be a monstah!

02:44:34.938 --> 02:44:37.247
(laughter)

02:44:37.247 --> 02:44:38.517
ASHLEY: All right!

02:44:38.517 --> 02:44:42.973
MATT: All righty. So your strength is back up to
19 with the Gauntlets of Ogre Power. Beefy Pike is back.

02:44:42.973 --> 02:44:44.202
ASHLEY: Yeah!

02:44:44.202 --> 02:44:50.772
TRAVIS: I also have-- wait, is Scanlan back?
(sniffs) Do I smell poo?

02:44:50.772 --> 02:44:53.669
MATT: As this time has passed, you guys do return
to the mansion, yeah.

02:44:53.669 --> 02:44:56.684
SAM: Ahh. I'll go down and check on things
downstairs.

02:44:56.684 --> 02:45:00.764
LIAM: Just a minor thing, on the walk back in the
sewer I would like to slowly, just in case some of

02:45:00.764 --> 02:45:07.333
these assholes want to fight a dragon tomorrow, I
slowly start attuning to acidic damage instead of fire.

02:45:07.333 --> 02:45:10.240
MATT: Not a problem. You are currently resistant
to acid damage.

02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:11.506
LIAM: Okay.

02:45:11.506 --> 02:45:16.003
TRAVIS: Didn't I get these Bracers of Defense from
you?

02:45:16.003 --> 02:45:21.292
SAM: Maybe? I don't really remember things like
that.

02:45:21.292 --> 02:45:23.390
TRAVIS: Oh. Do you want 'em back?

02:45:23.390 --> 02:45:24.919
SAM: Bracers of Defense, what do they do?

02:45:24.919 --> 02:45:29.940
TRAVIS: It gives you a plus two to your AC if you
wear no armor and are using no shield.

02:45:29.940 --> 02:45:36.027
SAM: I wear armor, so I could trade them for
something cool?

02:45:36.027 --> 02:45:37.824
TALIESIN: You wear armor?

02:45:37.824 --> 02:45:39.987
SAM: I wear Cold Snap Leather Armor.

02:45:39.987 --> 02:45:42.850
TRAVIS: Does anybody not wear any armor?

02:45:42.850 --> 02:45:45.231
MARISHA: The only one who doesn't wear armor is
you.

02:45:45.231 --> 02:45:51.580
TRAVIS: Yeah! Cool. Well, they're worth like six
thousand gold, so I guess--

02:45:51.580 --> 02:45:54.382
LAURA: Well, fucking hand 'em over, we'll sell 'em
for stuff.

02:45:54.382 --> 02:45:56.004
TRAVIS: I'll hold onto them, thanks.

02:45:56.004 --> 02:45:59.544
LAURA: Grog, I don't trust your haggling skills, I
promise.

02:45:59.544 --> 02:46:04.303
LIAM: If we can ever find a store open in a city
that's not destroyed, we can sell this stuff.

02:46:04.303 --> 02:46:06.497
MARISHA: Not much of an economy right now.

02:46:06.497 --> 02:46:08.483
TRAVIS: For 50! No.

02:46:08.483 --> 02:46:10.062
MATT: You'll have to make your way to another
city.

02:46:10.062 --> 02:46:11.340
LIAM: Back to the Clasp.

02:46:11.340 --> 02:46:12.447
MATT: Yeah.

02:46:12.447 --> 02:46:15.971
TRAVIS: So it's night, it's nighttime.

02:46:15.971 --> 02:46:19.916
LAURA: We should probably figure out if we're
going to fight a fucking dragon in the morning.

02:46:19.916 --> 02:46:22.778
TRAVIS: We owe Zanror a talk one way or the
other.

02:46:22.778 --> 02:46:27.398
LAURA: Oh, gods. We're going to go talk to him
tonight? We need to sleep!

02:46:27.398 --> 02:46:29.232
TRAVIS: Yeah, we need to heal up, big time.

02:46:29.232 --> 02:46:30.817
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm pretty tapped out.

02:46:30.817 --> 02:46:35.493
LIAM: Big Man, what are we going to do in the
morning when we get up?

02:46:35.493 --> 02:46:37.249
SAM: At dawn, we chit-chat!

02:46:37.249 --> 02:46:39.386
ASHLEY: At dawn, we plan.

02:46:39.386 --> 02:46:43.933
TRAVIS: You guys are the biggest fucking dicks
ever. Great conversations have been had at dawn,

02:46:43.933 --> 02:46:49.907
I'll have you know. We're not the only one.
Treaties have been signed, and-- stuff.

02:46:49.907 --> 02:46:53.394
TALIESIN: I'll also, weren't we at some point
supposed to check the library for clues of the

02:46:53.394 --> 02:46:55.155
location of the next Vestige?

02:46:55.155 --> 02:46:59.294
LAURA: What library? Here, the Cobalt Reserve?

02:46:59.294 --> 02:47:00.489
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:47:00.489 --> 02:47:02.454
LAURA: Yes, and we still haven't found Reginald's
daughter.

02:47:02.454 --> 02:47:05.085
TALIESIN: That is a thing.

02:47:05.085 --> 02:47:12.397
SAM: We'll send a carefully worded letter. We
can't roam the city for days trying-- looking for

02:47:12.397 --> 02:47:14.268
some dead guy's daughter, come on.

02:47:14.268 --> 02:47:17.198
TALIESIN: Well, we don't have to, we know where
she is. She's in the prison.

02:47:17.198 --> 02:47:19.185
LAURA: Oh, she's in prison!

02:47:19.185 --> 02:47:20.703
SAM: Well then we should go bust her out!

02:47:20.703 --> 02:47:23.115
TALIESIN: We may just be able to get them to
release her.

02:47:23.115 --> 02:47:25.494
TRAVIS: We might be able to do that.

02:47:25.494 --> 02:47:28.038
MARISHA: It sounds like there were a lot of people
in prison, last we heard.

02:47:28.038 --> 02:47:29.970
LIAM: If we can talk to them, but we have to talk to
them.

02:47:29.970 --> 02:47:32.178
TALIESIN: Grog has to talk to them.

02:47:32.178 --> 02:47:34.306
SAM: Should we sleep first? And go at dawn?

02:47:34.306 --> 02:47:36.713
MARISHA: I don't know if this can wait.

02:47:36.713 --> 02:47:37.899
SAM: What time is it?

02:47:37.899 --> 02:47:40.727
MATT: It's past dusk at this time, the hours you
guys were traveling, I'd say it's probably close

02:47:40.727 --> 02:47:47.215
to 9PM. For you guys to get a full rest, you got
to sleep soon if you're trying to get up pre-dawn.

02:47:47.215 --> 02:47:48.886
It's up to you.

02:47:48.886 --> 02:47:50.202
TRAVIS: How long is a long rest?

02:47:50.202 --> 02:47:51.877
MATT: A long rest is six to eight hours.

02:47:51.877 --> 02:47:57.565
TRAVIS: Six to eight. So on the short end, we
could get up at three and walk over.

02:47:57.565 --> 02:47:59.497
SAM: Wake his ass up.

02:47:59.497 --> 02:48:00.758
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:48:00.758 --> 02:48:08.409
LAURA: Let's go sleep now, wake up, go let the
prisoners free, and then talk to Kev-- Zanror.

02:48:08.409 --> 02:48:11.259
MARISHA: All right, well, when are we going to
talk amongst ourselves?

02:48:11.259 --> 02:48:14.119
TRAVIS: We should do that now.

02:48:14.119 --> 02:48:16.035
LAURA: Short, short talk.

02:48:16.035 --> 02:48:23.215
TALIESIN: I don't feel comfortable fighting a
dragon on 24 hours' notice after almost getting my

02:48:23.215 --> 02:48:24.599
arse handed to me.

02:48:24.599 --> 02:48:27.335
TRAVIS: All right, that's Percy's vote. Keyleth,
what do you say?

02:48:27.335 --> 02:48:31.909
MARISHA: Can I pass and wait to hear other
people's thoughts?

02:48:31.909 --> 02:48:33.755
TRAVIS: Sure, Vax, what do you say?

02:48:33.755 --> 02:48:38.526
LIAM: Much to my own chagrin, I'm in perfect
agreement with Frederick von Whatsitface de Rolo

02:48:38.526 --> 02:48:39.852
de Whatsit.

02:48:39.852 --> 02:48:41.126
TRAVIS: Vex?

02:48:41.126 --> 02:48:50.754
LAURA: I am-- I stand by what I said before, I
think we should let them go out and fight a

02:48:50.754 --> 02:48:56.768
dragon, and we try to rescue the city while they
are distracted.

02:48:56.768 --> 02:49:00.428
TRAVIS: Badass Hand-Smasher the First?

02:49:00.428 --> 02:49:02.514
SAM: That's you, Pike.

02:49:02.514 --> 02:49:14.487
ASHLEY: That's me. I'm having trouble. What are
you thinking?

02:49:14.487 --> 02:49:26.821
TRAVIS: I wouldn't care if we left now. I don't
think we're ready. I think it would be foolish. I

02:49:26.821 --> 02:49:36.847
learned a lesson yesterday. And I'm anxious to
die, don't get me wrong, but I'd rather win, if we

02:49:36.847 --> 02:49:40.960
planned a little better, than lose.

02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:44.267
LAURA: Are there any big trees in the city?

02:49:44.267 --> 02:49:50.083
TALIESIN: That's not a lot of people. We need to
move a lot of people. How many people are in

02:49:50.083 --> 02:49:52.083
theory still left in the city?

02:49:52.083 --> 02:49:53.474
MATT: You have no idea.

02:49:53.474 --> 02:49:54.842
LAURA: An entire fucking city.

02:49:54.842 --> 02:49:56.141
MARISHA: I think a lot.

02:49:56.141 --> 02:49:59.472
MATT: I mean, a lot of people have left and gone
to Kymal, a lot have left and gone to the Foramere

02:49:59.472 --> 02:50:04.150
Basin, which you already saw. And a lot of people
are still within the city, and currently being

02:50:04.150 --> 02:50:11.075
lorded over and run--or were-- by the Herd, you
don't know quite how many still remain. You've

02:50:11.075 --> 02:50:15.923
seen many jump between homes, and a few that've
waited for this whole thing to blow over.

02:50:15.923 --> 02:50:18.129
TALIESIN: Based on the size of the city and the
number of people I've seen, what would be my

02:50:18.129 --> 02:50:22.273
extrapolation? I'm a reasonable human being.
Triple digits, four digits?

02:50:22.273 --> 02:50:26.747
MATT: I mean, you're looking at maybe four digits,
low four digits.

02:50:26.747 --> 02:50:28.102
TALIESIN: Low four digits, that'll do.

02:50:28.102 --> 02:50:34.832
SAM: Listen, we have this Herd. They will be our
allies for exactly one day.

02:50:34.832 --> 02:50:35.956
TRAVIS: In theory.

02:50:35.956 --> 02:50:44.430
SAM: In theory. So if we do not use them to attack
dragons, can we at least use them to do something?

02:50:44.430 --> 02:50:52.434
Because they will no longer ever be our allies
again after today. We could use them to go try to

02:50:52.434 --> 02:50:59.109
kill the dragon on their own, we could use them to
try to kill something or someone else for us, we

02:50:59.109 --> 02:51:04.628
could use them to try to help clear the city, if
we convinced them that it was in their best

02:51:04.628 --> 02:51:05.739
interest to--

02:51:05.739 --> 02:51:11.189
TRAVIS: I'll amend my proposition to this. I'm not
sure what that word means.

02:51:11.189 --> 02:51:12.838
SAM: 'This'?

02:51:12.838 --> 02:51:20.490
TRAVIS: Yes. If we go and speak to Zanror, and we
can't change his mind about fighting this dragon,

02:51:20.490 --> 02:51:26.938
which I'm not entirely comfortable asking him to
do, we at least get the innocents, prisoners, and

02:51:26.938 --> 02:51:35.342
hostages out of the city. We pretend that we're
going to fight the dragon with him, and when shit

02:51:35.342 --> 02:51:38.189
goes down, we wait.

02:51:38.189 --> 02:51:41.056
MARISHA: That's actually what I was thinking.

02:51:41.056 --> 02:51:43.399
TALIESIN: This is not a bad plan.

02:51:43.399 --> 02:51:49.683
MARISHA: We have the means to bail us out very
quickly if things go wrong.

02:51:49.683 --> 02:52:00.860
TRAVIS: And if I may, in case any of your
consciences are in conflict, the Herd is full of

02:52:00.860 --> 02:52:10.428
murderers and pillagers and rapists and child
killers. The worst of the lot. And only when I was

02:52:10.428 --> 02:52:15.932
younger did I not know the difference between
right and wrong. Still working on that definition.

02:52:15.932 --> 02:52:26.446
But I can tell you, this group ain't the best lot
in the world, and they mean nothing to me compared

02:52:26.446 --> 02:52:28.401
to the people in this room.

02:52:28.401 --> 02:52:35.852
MARISHA: Conversely, you were a part of that lot
once. And you came out of it.

02:52:35.852 --> 02:52:43.443
TRAVIS: Once. But are we trying to save a herd? Or
are we trying to save a town?

02:52:43.443 --> 02:52:48.699
MARISHA: I think we're trying to save the world at
this point.

02:52:48.699 --> 02:52:50.672
TRAVIS: That's bigger than a town, right?

02:52:50.672 --> 02:52:51.903
LIAM: By a bit.

02:52:51.903 --> 02:52:53.026
LAURA: A little.

02:52:53.026 --> 02:52:55.184
TALIESIN: Today we can save a town.

02:52:55.184 --> 02:53:02.581
SAM: You know, we're all gathered here together,
so I'd like to take this opportunity with

02:53:02.581 --> 02:53:10.712
Wilhand's blessing to propose marriage to you,
Pike Trickfoot. Will you make me the happiest

02:53:10.712 --> 02:53:17.752
gnome ever? I'm sorry, I couldn't contain myself
any longer.

02:53:17.752 --> 02:53:21.137
ASHLEY: That was so sudden!

02:53:21.137 --> 02:53:25.943
SAM: I know, I'm sorry, I've been thinking about
it all night tonight, I went looking for Kaylie,

02:53:25.943 --> 02:53:31.432
she wasn't there, and then-- I'm sorry, I blurted
it out, it's just, we're all together, we're never

02:53:31.432 --> 02:53:33.386
all together like this, so.

02:53:33.386 --> 02:53:35.590
LIAM: Can I roll stealth and hide right now?

02:53:35.590 --> 02:53:36.802
(laughter)

02:53:36.802 --> 02:53:37.920
MATT: Go ahead.

02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:39.390
ASHLEY: Can I roll stealth and hide right now?

02:53:39.390 --> 02:53:41.095
MATT: You can try to if you want to.

02:53:41.095 --> 02:53:42.337
LIAM: 28, I'm gone.

02:53:42.337 --> 02:53:46.945
TALIESIN: Scanlan, at least this could wait until
after the danger's over.

02:53:46.945 --> 02:53:50.519
SAM: I know, I know, but we may die later tonight
when we go see Zanror.

02:53:50.519 --> 02:53:52.102
TALIESIN: Only if we follow your example.

02:53:52.102 --> 02:53:54.532
MARISHA: That was the most impressive segue I've
ever encountered.

02:53:54.532 --> 02:53:56.435
TALIESIN: I was trying really hard here.

02:53:56.435 --> 02:53:58.386
ASHLEY: That was a segue if I've ever heard one.

02:53:58.386 --> 02:54:06.026
SAM: You know what, don't answer now, don't answer
now. I know that you want to say yes, but please,

02:54:06.026 --> 02:54:10.891
don't answer yet. Just think about it and we'll
talk about it some other time.

02:54:10.891 --> 02:54:17.562
ASHLEY: I will definitely have to think about it.
Because that's a lot--

02:54:17.562 --> 02:54:20.218
TALIESIN: We can work on some sort of concoction
if you need help sleeping after that information,

02:54:20.218 --> 02:54:22.890
at this point. That would keep me up for hours.
That's-- yeah.

02:54:22.890 --> 02:54:25.239
LIAM: Do we have any alore root?

02:54:25.239 --> 02:54:29.451
(laughter)

02:54:29.451 --> 02:54:33.806
MARISHA: You ever want a vision quest, just let me
know.

02:54:33.806 --> 02:54:45.188
ASHLEY: You know what, I will think on it, and I
will give you an answer after some dragons are

02:54:45.188 --> 02:54:52.048
killed and-- let me think on it, Scanlan. Let me
think on it.

02:54:52.048 --> 02:54:54.187
SAM: All right.

02:54:54.187 --> 02:54:56.488
LAURA: (whispers) I think that went well.

02:54:56.488 --> 02:54:58.052
TRAVIS: Do you mean, like, permanent marriage?

02:54:58.052 --> 02:54:59.591
ASHLEY: I think I was really start-- yeah.

02:54:59.591 --> 02:55:04.408
SAM: No no no, I'm sorry, that didn't, I didn't do
that the way I had planned it in my head, I'm sorry.

02:55:04.408 --> 02:55:05.601
ASHLEY: It's okay.

02:55:05.601 --> 02:55:10.593
SAM: I was overcome with a lot of stress, you
know? We're fighting dragons and bonding with

02:55:10.593 --> 02:55:16.159
goliaths here and you're in my house, and it's a
very very stressful night for me, I'm sorry.

02:55:16.159 --> 02:55:18.809
MARISHA: That was the weirdest coping mechanism
I've ever heard of.

02:55:18.809 --> 02:55:20.532
SAM: Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry.

02:55:20.532 --> 02:55:25.423
ASHLEY: It's okay, maybe you just feel that way because
we could all die, so.

02:55:25.423 --> 02:55:26.559
SAM: For sure.

02:55:26.559 --> 02:55:29.788
ASHLEY: You feel like you maybe-- I don't know.

02:55:29.788 --> 02:55:31.418
SAM: You know what, we'll table it. We'll table
it.

02:55:31.418 --> 02:55:32.385
ASHLEY: We'll table it.

02:55:32.385 --> 02:55:33.380
SAM: We'll table it.

02:55:33.380 --> 02:55:37.173
ASHLEY: Okay. Where is Wilhand?

02:55:37.173 --> 02:55:39.087
SAM: I think he's in the kitchen.

02:55:39.087 --> 02:55:41.467
ASHLEY: He's probably made a delicious meal.

02:55:41.467 --> 02:55:44.071
LAURA: We should eat and then sleep.

02:55:44.071 --> 02:55:48.748
MATT: You guys make your way to the kitchen?

02:55:48.748 --> 02:55:51.364
MARISHA: Well, let's finish this conversation over
food.

02:55:51.364 --> 02:55:53.081
MATT: There is a-- what did you have in mind?

02:55:53.081 --> 02:55:56.320
LIAM: I'm going back to my room, I'm not eating.
Yeah.

02:55:56.320 --> 02:55:58.210
MARISHA: Wait, we need to finish this
conversation.

02:55:58.210 --> 02:56:06.229
MATT: He's already gone, you don't know where he
is. Vax disappeared in the confusion. You head

02:56:06.229 --> 02:56:11.580
back to the main dining area. There is a full meal
prepared of very creative uses of chicken.

02:56:11.580 --> 02:56:15.591
(laughter)

02:56:15.591 --> 02:56:18.687
ASHLEY: It's all-- if he had more stuff, he could
really do well.

02:56:18.687 --> 02:56:22.238
TALIESIN: I don't-- I don't think you're supposed
to eat-- that's creative.

02:56:22.238 --> 02:56:24.055
MARISHA: Every chicken dish ever.

02:56:24.055 --> 02:56:25.471
TALIESIN: I'll have the soup.

02:56:25.471 --> 02:56:30.998
MATT: Wilhand is slumped in the corner on a stool
with a bottle of wine that is mostly empty.

02:56:30.998 --> 02:56:33.461
LIAM: (old-man voice) Try the chicken sorbet!

02:56:33.461 --> 02:56:35.882
MATT: A bit of drool dribbling down his neck.

02:56:35.882 --> 02:56:43.422
TRAVIS: I take the bottle. He pulled it back! I
let him have it.

02:56:43.422 --> 02:56:47.779
LAURA: I go and whisper to Scanlan, are you all
right?

02:56:47.779 --> 02:56:52.398
SAM: Yeah, I'm fine. She didn't say no?

02:56:52.398 --> 02:56:55.852
LAURA: She didn't. I sort of meant about Kaylie as
well, though.

02:56:55.852 --> 02:57:04.912
SAM: Oh, yes. I just don't know where she is, so it's a
bit stressful. That's all. She's safe though,

02:57:04.912 --> 02:57:09.783
right? Just say yes.

02:57:09.783 --> 02:57:12.173
LAURA: Yes. Of course she is.

02:57:12.173 --> 02:57:13.669
SAM: Yeah, I thought so.

02:57:13.669 --> 02:57:17.256
TRAVIS: I go and grab a shitload of chicken and
start shoving it in my mouth.

02:57:17.256 --> 02:57:18.967
MARISHA: Is Wilhand here?

02:57:18.967 --> 02:57:20.380
TRAVIS: He's passed out.

02:57:20.380 --> 02:57:22.542
MATT: He's passed out in a corner with a bottle of
white wine that's half-empty.

02:57:22.542 --> 02:57:24.807
ASHLEY: I go get a blanket and cover him.

02:57:24.807 --> 02:57:28.911
MARISHA: I walk over and I slide the bottle of ale
out of his hand.

02:57:28.911 --> 02:57:31.907
MATT: (laughs) Death grip on the bottle.

02:57:31.907 --> 02:57:39.508
MARISHA: All right. I leave the bottle of ale and
I take the statue of Sarenrae and I put it in his

02:57:39.508 --> 02:57:41.530
other hand, tuck him up.

02:57:41.530 --> 02:57:45.369
MATT: Cuddles it up with the blanket around it,
he's like this little bundle of old gnomish

02:57:45.369 --> 02:57:47.443
sleeping joy right now.

02:57:47.443 --> 02:57:48.999
ASHLEY: Oh, buddy.

02:57:48.999 --> 02:57:50.274
TRAVIS: Is Vax here?

02:57:50.274 --> 02:57:51.562
MATT: No.

02:57:51.562 --> 02:57:55.382
TRAVIS: Shit. I wanted to put like shaving cream
in his hand and tickle his nose with a feather.

02:57:55.382 --> 02:58:00.018
MARISHA: Although I feel like we still need to
finish this conversation.

02:58:00.018 --> 02:58:01.467
Shouldn't we all be present?

02:58:01.467 --> 02:58:03.743
TRAVIS: What's left to finish?

02:58:03.743 --> 02:58:06.783
TALIESIN: Other than take a rest.

02:58:06.783 --> 02:58:10.660
SAM: We're going to try to convince them to delay.
If they won't delay, then we say, all right,

02:58:10.660 --> 02:58:12.864
let's go fight, and we send them into battle.

02:58:12.864 --> 02:58:15.216
LAURA: And then we don't really fight.

02:58:15.216 --> 02:58:16.294
MARISHA: Huh?

02:58:16.294 --> 02:58:19.867
LAURA: Well, we see how they do, and we try to
rescue people.

02:58:19.867 --> 02:58:24.505
MARISHA: Maybe it's time to split up. Maybe some
of us help fight the dragons while

02:58:24.505 --> 02:58:25.949
others help evacuate.

02:58:25.949 --> 02:58:32.946
LAURA: No. I'm not separating from you when we go
fight a giant fucking dragon.

02:58:32.946 --> 02:58:39.793
TALIESIN: I may run to try and quietly by myself
grab a few things from the library that we may

02:58:39.793 --> 02:58:41.663
need for the next Vestiges.

02:58:41.663 --> 02:58:43.262
MARISHA: You're going tonight?

02:58:43.262 --> 02:58:45.467
TALIESIN: Ah. Possibly in the morning.

02:58:45.467 --> 02:58:47.620
MARISHA: I'll go with you.

02:58:47.620 --> 02:58:50.400
MATT: You do recall based on your previous scrying
spell--

02:58:50.400 --> 02:58:53.006
MARISHA: It was ruined and most of it had been
picked clean.

02:58:53.006 --> 02:58:58.644
MATT: --it was ruined, a lot of it picked over,
Allura was escaping with a couple of tomes under

02:58:58.644 --> 02:59:01.152
her arms before escaping via spark.

02:59:01.152 --> 02:59:02.715
TALIESIN: Oh, all right then.

02:59:02.715 --> 02:59:05.909
MARISHA: I mean, it doesn't mean that there's not
something still potentially there, but I'm sure

02:59:05.909 --> 02:59:09.905
Allura got most of the good stuff. She's not
stupid.

02:59:09.905 --> 02:59:11.433
TALIESIN: No, that's fair.

02:59:11.433 --> 02:59:14.529
MARISHA: We can still check it out.

02:59:14.529 --> 02:59:18.129
MATT: So what's the plan?

02:59:18.129 --> 02:59:20.396
TRAVIS: We go to sleep--

02:59:20.396 --> 02:59:27.287
LIAM: I don't have a plan, but while they're all
dicking about, after about an hour of staring at

02:59:27.287 --> 02:59:43.761
the wall, I start talking to the air, and say: you
know, I've never put much stock in faith. And for

02:59:43.761 --> 02:59:54.835
the life of me, I question so much why my sister
took that broom and I can't figure out another

02:59:54.835 --> 03:00:00.286
reason for her to have done it, other than fate,
for I would not be standing here, nor would anyone

03:00:00.286 --> 03:00:23.731
else in my family. So. You weren't my first
choice, but I'm over that. And I'm ready. I will

03:00:23.731 --> 03:00:36.340
come to you as soon as I am able. I don't know how
any of this works. I'm coming. Whatever we need to

03:00:36.340 --> 03:00:47.041
do. I don't know what I believe, but I made a
promise and I'm sticking to it and I'm coming to

03:00:47.041 --> 03:00:49.839
you. So just hang on.

03:00:49.839 --> 03:01:00.336
MATT: Minutes of silence pass. No response.
Nothing.

03:01:00.336 --> 03:01:04.814
LIAM: I go to bed.

03:01:04.814 --> 03:01:08.431
MATT: Okay. As you get to your bed, you look down
and a single black feather is currently set on the

03:01:08.431 --> 03:01:09.992
pillow before you.

03:01:09.992 --> 03:01:13.603
LIAM: I tuck it behind my ear.

03:01:13.603 --> 03:01:19.634
MATT: All right. The rest of you going to sleep
for the evening?

03:01:19.634 --> 03:01:21.039
ALL: Yes.

03:01:21.039 --> 03:01:30.042
ASHLEY: As we're walking to sleep, I grab Scanlan
real quick. I grabbed Scanlan real quick once

03:01:30.042 --> 03:01:31.336
everybody's--

03:01:31.336 --> 03:01:32.532
MATT: Okay.

03:01:32.532 --> 03:01:35.341
ASHLEY: So, I have to tell you something.

03:01:35.341 --> 03:01:37.994
SAM: You don't have to answer now.

03:01:37.994 --> 03:01:39.331
ASHLEY: It's not an answer for that.

03:01:39.331 --> 03:01:46.433
SAM: No, it's fine, I was, it was, I was impetuous
and silly and I don't know sometimes, I get

03:01:46.500 --> 03:01:51.222
hamhanded around you-- I'm very smooth with
everybody else, I don't know what it is.

03:01:51.222 --> 03:02:04.254
ASHLEY: It's just that-- it's fine. It's okay. I
have to confess something to you. When you gave me

03:02:04.254 --> 03:02:05.412
that letter--

03:02:05.412 --> 03:02:06.605
SAM: Yes?

03:02:06.605 --> 03:02:09.576
ASHLEY: When you told me not to read it until you
died--

03:02:09.576 --> 03:02:11.098
SAM: Yes?

03:02:11.098 --> 03:02:19.070
ASHLEY: I read it immediately after you left.
Because curiosity gets the best of me sometimes, I

03:02:19.070 --> 03:02:20.559
can't-- it's not--

03:02:20.559 --> 03:02:22.599
SAM: But you can't, you're like a priest or
something, you can't lie!

03:02:22.599 --> 03:02:24.646
ASHLEY: I know, but that-- what does that even
mean?

03:02:24.646 --> 03:02:26.126
SAM: I don't know, I--

03:02:26.126 --> 03:02:28.811
ASHLEY: I go back and forth with it.

03:02:28.811 --> 03:02:30.399
SAM: There was personal stuff in there!

03:02:30.399 --> 03:02:39.672
ASHLEY: I know, but what-- I know, it was very
personal, and I just wanted to tell you that

03:02:39.672 --> 03:02:43.408
everything you said in that letter, I promise to
you.

03:02:43.408 --> 03:02:45.695
SAM: You do?

03:02:45.695 --> 03:02:53.915
ASHLEY: That I give you my word that everything
you said in that letter I promise to you I will do.

03:02:53.915 --> 03:02:56.350
SAM: Really.

03:02:56.350 --> 03:02:58.912
ASHLEY: If you die.

03:02:58.912 --> 03:03:01.987
(laughter)

03:03:01.987 --> 03:03:04.367
ASHLEY: Which I am hoping that you never do.

03:03:04.367 --> 03:03:07.223
SAM: Well, we've almost died a few times very
recently.

03:03:07.223 --> 03:03:13.683
ASHLEY: I know, and we've had so many close calls
and I feel like I just needed to tell you so you

03:03:13.683 --> 03:03:20.045
had some comfort in your person, in your body,
that you knew that if--

03:03:20.045 --> 03:03:25.669
SAM: My body? What are you t-- you sound like me,
you're stammering and babbling like I was!

03:03:25.669 --> 03:03:29.043
ASHLEY: I know, you do make me a little nervous
and I'm not really sure why, and I need to

03:03:29.043 --> 03:03:30.164
reconcile these feelings.

03:03:30.164 --> 03:03:31.788
SAM: We should just marry then!

03:03:31.788 --> 03:03:32.791
ASHLEY: Well, I don't know!

03:03:32.791 --> 03:03:35.694
SAM: I don't know either! It's a very strange
relationship.

03:03:35.694 --> 03:03:39.671
ASHLEY: I'm so confused. Maybe we should just
sleep together and see what happens.

03:03:39.671 --> 03:03:43.236
SAM: Okay, fine. No, you said it! You said it!

03:03:43.236 --> 03:03:46.852
ASHLEY: I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding, it was
just a joke.

03:03:46.852 --> 03:03:48.678
SAM: You can't joke about that stuff with me!

03:03:48.678 --> 03:03:56.721
ASHLEY: I know. I'm being careless, I think that
drink that Wilhand gave me is settling, and it's--

03:03:56.721 --> 03:04:03.170
moving about. Making me say things.

03:04:03.170 --> 03:04:04.797
SAM: I don't even know what's going on right now!

03:04:04.797 --> 03:04:07.502
ASHLEY: I'm just kidding. I don't actually think
we should sleep together. I just need to tell you

03:04:07.502 --> 03:04:08.582
that I--

03:04:08.582 --> 03:04:10.796
SAM: Thank you for clarifying?!

03:04:10.796 --> 03:04:14.822
(laughter)

03:04:14.822 --> 03:04:17.984
ASHLEY: Anyway, Scanlan, I love you.

03:04:17.984 --> 03:04:26.673
SAM: This is not how I thought tonight was going
to go! I feel betrayed, I feel let down, I feel so

03:04:26.673 --> 03:04:28.122
horny right now!

03:04:28.122 --> 03:04:35.041
ASHLEY: Well, you've grown those forearms for a
reason, so just go take care of business.

03:04:35.041 --> 03:04:37.119
SAM: Oh, come on, Pike!

03:04:37.119 --> 03:04:39.969
LIAM: That's some reincorporation right here.

03:04:39.969 --> 03:04:42.946
MARISHA: Callback!

03:04:42.946 --> 03:04:52.666
SAM: Listen. Everything I said in that letter I
meant. And regardless of whether or not you

03:04:52.666 --> 03:05:01.323
totally betrayed me by reading it, I'm glad that
you at least understood the sentiment, I hope?

03:05:01.323 --> 03:05:02.967
ASHLEY: I did.

03:05:02.967 --> 03:05:13.642
SAM: And appreciated my honesty and the fact that
you are taking that vow? If I die.

03:05:13.642 --> 03:05:16.596
ASHLEY: Yes, I am taking &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; vow.

03:05:16.596 --> 03:05:24.115
SAM: Yes, I understand. Well then, that's fine.
That's all I need.

03:05:24.115 --> 03:05:27.121
ASHLEY: Okay. And I was trying to be funny and I
didn't mean to be careless with your feelings.

03:05:27.121 --> 03:05:29.821
SAM: No, I know, I didn't know why I proposed,
that's stupid.

03:05:29.821 --> 03:05:32.339
ASHLEY: I do love you so much.

03:05:32.339 --> 03:05:33.309
SAM: I love you!

03:05:33.309 --> 03:05:40.101
ASHLEY: And a part of my heart does-- I do love
somebody else very much.

03:05:40.101 --> 03:05:41.404
SAM: I'm sorry?

03:05:41.404 --> 03:05:48.354
ASHLEY: But my feelings are growing for you a
little bit in a weird way and I'm not sure what it

03:05:48.354 --> 03:05:53.560
is, but we'll figure it out. I'm confused.

03:05:53.560 --> 03:06:04.673
SAM: I think we both are? Anyway. Thank you for
telling me the truth after you sort of lied to me, so--

03:06:04.673 --> 03:06:07.380
ASHLEY: But I never told you I did not read it!

03:06:07.380 --> 03:06:13.689
SAM: --oh, I know, but all right. Anyway. Thank
you for this-- sort of. I guess I have to go to my

03:06:13.689 --> 03:06:18.250
room and think about this while I stare at my
picture in the mirror above my bed.

03:06:18.250 --> 03:06:20.897
ASHLEY: Which is-- what's your picture?

03:06:20.897 --> 03:06:22.101
SAM: It's just a mirror.

03:06:22.101 --> 03:06:23.520
(laughter)

03:06:23.520 --> 03:06:33.646
SAM: But, listen. I do love you, I will always
love you, even in death, and thank you for telling

03:06:33.646 --> 03:06:39.687
me that and-- I hope it doesn't come to that, but
if it does, that makes me feel a little bit better

03:06:39.687 --> 03:06:41.385
about things.

03:06:41.385 --> 03:06:43.564
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, I love you.

03:06:43.564 --> 03:06:45.177
SAM: Sleep tight.

03:06:45.177 --> 03:06:47.144
ASHLEY: I give him a hug and a kiss on his cheek.

03:06:47.144 --> 03:06:48.726
MATT: Okay.

03:06:48.726 --> 03:06:58.723
SAM: I kick the dirt a little bit and then I walk
away and I click my heels. Little jump-and-click.

03:06:58.723 --> 03:07:11.403
MATT: And-- anything else, before the evening's
rest comes? All right. Sleep finds you all, some

03:07:11.403 --> 03:07:16.816
easier than others, until a measured period of
time, I believe?

03:07:16.816 --> 03:07:17.847
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:07:17.847 --> 03:07:26.774
MATT: Grog sprung awake, gathered the folks in the
pre-dawn hour of the following morning. You gather

03:07:26.774 --> 03:07:34.203
your stuff, exit the mansion, and start making
your way towards the Margrave's house.

03:07:34.203 --> 03:07:38.791
TRAVIS: Is there anyone on the street?

03:07:38.791 --> 03:07:41.484
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:07:41.484 --> 03:07:49.744
TRAVIS: 19. Plus zero.

03:07:49.744 --> 03:08:01.272
MATT: You guys exit Wilhand's place and there is a
cross-street that Wilhand's home is nearby, that's

03:08:01.272 --> 03:08:05.058
like a building sandwiching it on each side, and
the one just south of it is on the corner of that

03:08:05.058 --> 03:08:10.777
cross street. Across the way as you guys exit the
room, or exit the front of the building, you see

03:08:10.777 --> 03:08:15.290
two figures stand up, arms crossed. The same
individuals you saw earlier.

03:08:15.290 --> 03:08:16.659
MARISHA: Of Wilhand's place?

03:08:16.659 --> 03:08:23.997
TRAVIS: Same people I saw outside of the house
earlier. All right, fuck this shit. I turn and I

03:08:23.997 --> 03:08:25.911
walk towards those two people.

03:08:25.911 --> 03:08:30.583
MATT: Okay. You approach, you recognize them.
They're the same two people that were watching you

03:08:30.583 --> 03:08:34.478
while you guys were resting directly after the battle
with Kevdak in the center of the square, the two

03:08:34.478 --> 03:08:37.018
that were assigned to keep an eye on you.

03:08:37.018 --> 03:08:39.834
TRAVIS: Hello. What're your two names?

03:08:39.834 --> 03:08:46.295
MATT: They look at each other. "Veskin. Mortar.
What do you want?"

03:08:46.295 --> 03:08:55.031
TRAVIS: Funny, I feel like I've seen you about in
the last few hours, watching us.

03:08:55.031 --> 03:08:57.699
MATT: "Keeping an eye out."

03:08:57.699 --> 03:08:59.800
TRAVIS: Huh. Why?

03:08:59.800 --> 03:09:07.410
MATT: "Because you killed our leader. Takes a
while to see what strength is a man who's killed

03:09:07.410 --> 03:09:13.859
"your leader. If he's a murderer. If he's an
honor-bound man. Or if he's a piece of shit that

03:09:13.859 --> 03:09:15.827
"you should wipe off your heels."

03:09:15.827 --> 03:09:16.945
TRAVIS: Hm.

03:09:16.945 --> 03:09:19.781
MATT: "Takes a bit of watching to get that. Jury's
still out."

03:09:19.781 --> 03:09:23.266
TRAVIS: Don't you have a new leader now?

03:09:23.266 --> 03:09:29.474
MATT: They look at each other. "Maybe."

03:09:29.474 --> 03:09:36.506
TRAVIS: Would you like to walk with us? We're
going for a little morning stroll.

03:09:36.506 --> 03:09:39.995
MATT: "Nothing else to do."

03:09:39.995 --> 03:09:45.995
And they wipe a little bit of sleep from one
of the corner of the eye. "Lead on."

03:09:45.995 --> 03:09:50.129
TRAVIS: And we head to the Margrave's house.

03:09:50.129 --> 03:09:51.760
MATT: Okay.

03:09:51.760 --> 03:09:58.533
MARISHA: I put my old-school circlet back on, by
the way, but I have the other circlet with me.

03:09:58.533 --> 03:10:02.762
MATT: Okay. So you've re-attuned to the original
circlet. You guys, walking through the town as you

03:10:02.762 --> 03:10:10.779
do, there is a bit of business, there are, some of
the street lanterns have been lit, where

03:10:10.779 --> 03:10:15.770
previously at this hour they would be greatly
diminished, there is movement, you see some of

03:10:15.770 --> 03:10:22.814
the Herd that are now wandering forth,
armoring up, gathering weapons, you know this.

03:10:22.814 --> 03:10:29.896
This is the morning before a siege. This is the
pre-dawn meditation before the Herd takes its

03:10:29.896 --> 03:10:38.302
next-- yeah. Warpaint being applied, breakfasts
being enjoyed, people preparing themselves for the

03:10:38.302 --> 03:10:46.231
frenzy of battle, this is the pre-war ritual of
the Herd of Storms. As you make your way

03:10:46.231 --> 03:10:53.072
southward, across the once-battlefield,
returned-town-square outside the Margrave's home,

03:10:53.072 --> 03:11:01.441
to the front doors, the door is open and you see
there are two individuals sitting at the front.

03:11:01.441 --> 03:11:13.912
One of which is a goliath keeping watch, to the
right of him on the other side is a gruff-looking

03:11:13.912 --> 03:11:19.625
female human, humanoid, sitting there, arms
crossed, watching as you guys approach.

03:11:19.625 --> 03:11:27.167
TRAVIS: I make eye contact with both of them. I
seek an audience with Zanror.

03:11:27.167 --> 03:11:29.932
MATT: "He's expecting you, get in."

03:11:29.932 --> 03:11:33.058
TRAVIS: We go in.

03:11:33.058 --> 03:11:38.000
MATT: So you guys walk into the house, you see the
interior of the Margrave's abode. Across the way

03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:49.498
there is a haphazard throne that's been built from
lumber and carts and things that were pulled from

03:11:49.498 --> 03:11:54.909
resources within the town. You can see this
is probably where Kevdak sat once they had taken

03:11:54.909 --> 03:11:56.521
the home, the estate.

03:11:56.521 --> 03:12:00.130
TRAVIS: I grab my earpiece and very lightly say,
Vax, keep your eyes about you.

03:12:00.130 --> 03:12:01.545
MATT: Are you all entering with Grog?

03:12:01.545 --> 03:12:03.685
ALL: Yeah, sure.

03:12:03.685 --> 03:12:06.557
SAM: Should we leave a couple outside or anything
or no?

03:12:06.557 --> 03:12:08.024
TRAVIS: Nope, stay together.

03:12:08.024 --> 03:12:12.108
MATT: Okay. You guys all enter into the foyer
area. The throne is across the way, there's a long

03:12:12.108 --> 03:12:17.397
hallway that leads to the back of the estate, and
at the very back you can see the throne. There are

03:12:17.397 --> 03:12:23.535
some low sconces in the walls that give the
flicker of light, in the center there is a round

03:12:23.535 --> 03:12:30.230
table which is currently set. There are some
weapons and daggers, a few javelins tossed onto

03:12:30.230 --> 03:12:38.487
it, looks like some fruit that's partially eaten,
and there on the table you see Zanror, already

03:12:38.487 --> 03:12:43.586
armored up, arms splayed across the side, looking
down at the table, looking down at the weapons

03:12:43.586 --> 03:12:53.711
before him. Behind him, you see his wife, the
lady, the other pregnant goliath that is currently

03:12:53.711 --> 03:12:58.158
behind rubbing his shoulders and talking to him
into his ear. They both look up and see as you

03:12:58.158 --> 03:13:01.616
approach, at which point Zanror whispers to her
for a second.

03:13:01.616 --> 03:13:03.307
LAURA: What does he say?

03:13:03.307 --> 03:13:13.115
MATT: He says, "We have company." They both sit
back as he goes upright as you approach. "Glad to

03:13:13.115 --> 03:13:20.248
"see you had the sense to take my summons. So.
Now's the day where we prepare."

03:13:20.248 --> 03:13:23.636
TRAVIS: Aye, wouldn't miss it for the world.

03:13:23.636 --> 03:13:35.913
MATT: (sighs) "First and foremost, Grog, take that
shit off. It's really freaking out most of our people."

03:13:35.913 --> 03:13:39.614
TRAVIS: It is pretty sweet, though, isn't it?

03:13:39.614 --> 03:13:43.088
MATT: "It's confusing, to say the least, aye?"

03:13:43.088 --> 03:13:48.670
TRAVIS: We all have our preparations to make
before battle. Don't worry about mine.

03:13:48.670 --> 03:13:55.892
MATT: "To each their own, I suppose. Heh. You've
fallen in some strange paths since we last met."

03:13:55.892 --> 03:13:58.301
TRAVIS: You have no idea.

03:13:58.301 --> 03:14:04.934
MATT: "Rest of you, can we expect your attendance
in this glorious fight?"

03:14:04.934 --> 03:14:09.243
LIAM: Wherever Grog goes, we go as well.

03:14:09.243 --> 03:14:12.320
MATT: "Good. Good."

03:14:12.320 --> 03:14:19.237
MARISHA: I suppose we could ask the same of your
Herd, Leader Zanror.

03:14:19.237 --> 03:14:28.717
MATT: "We're prepared now. And we've met around
with the remaining Herd, we've spread the tale of

03:14:28.717 --> 03:14:38.909
"Kevdak's fall. Demanded solidarity under my arms
and yours. And our plan to show our strength and

03:14:38.909 --> 03:14:47.897
"independence from his reign by cutting down the
black dragon of Gatshadow. Many are easily swayed

03:14:47.897 --> 03:14:56.128
"by words of bloodshed and glory. Others, the
hesitation in their eyes worries me. Now

03:14:56.128 --> 03:15:04.735
"Greenbeard had set us down a path of ruin,
coming here. We conquer and move as a people. This

03:15:04.735 --> 03:15:12.215
"life without roaming, lording over a broken city,
living under the thumb of a drake? This is not our

03:15:12.215 --> 03:15:22.160
"life. Since Greenbeard's age and selfishness had
caught up to him, Kevdak's lust for the fear of

03:15:22.160 --> 03:15:30.582
"others swayed his judgment into more
self-indulgent territory. And while we all quelled

03:15:30.582 --> 03:15:38.307
"rebellion, gathered gold and goods, while I
parlayed with that beast, my uncle stayed in

03:15:38.307 --> 03:15:44.963
"here." Points back at the throne behind him.
"Taking his drink and his women, breaking those

03:15:44.963 --> 03:15:54.393
"who could not defend themselves out of idle
boredom. I could see it. Regret. He'd listened to

03:15:54.393 --> 03:16:01.608
"the old man and led us into ruin, but the only
thing stronger than Kevdak's might was his pride.

03:16:01.608 --> 03:16:14.123
"So we stayed. He could not admit he was wrong. He
abandoned reason and foresight. And I questioned

03:16:14.123 --> 03:16:26.982
"him, our actions here in the city. Our future. He
beat me and threw me into chains. So learning from

03:16:26.982 --> 03:16:35.582
"the mistakes, here. When this dragon is done, we
leave. We have no place in this city."

03:16:35.582 --> 03:16:44.535
LAURA: You speak of pride, of listening to reason.
Might be smart to listen to reason in this

03:16:44.535 --> 03:16:54.123
instance as well. That dragon is ancient and very
large. It's quite possible he'll wipe out all of

03:16:54.123 --> 03:17:08.243
us, the town included. It might be smart to
swallow our pride for the day and prepare. Come

03:17:08.243 --> 03:17:13.290
back when we have preparations made and we can
take the dragon down.

03:17:13.290 --> 03:17:26.655
MATT: "Please understand, the dragon has claimed
quite the tithe from our people. We've provided

03:17:26.655 --> 03:17:33.223
"what we can, what we could scavenge, but even then
the coffers of this town that we could acquire are

03:17:33.223 --> 03:17:42.533
"growing thin. The reason that we were preparing
for this attack even before you arrived is because

03:17:42.533 --> 03:17:48.719
"we were at the end of our rope. Many of the people
made away from this town with their goods before

03:17:48.719 --> 03:17:54.780
"we came, and many still have escaped our grasp
when we took over. So the paltry sums that we

03:17:54.780 --> 03:17:59.985
"could gather in the time that we did hold reign
over Westruun-- the dragon is not going to be

03:17:59.985 --> 03:18:07.997
"happy that each package dwindles with each passing
couple of days. Either we take this element of

03:18:07.997 --> 03:18:18.502
"surprise and fight it on our own terms, or we wait
for it to come to us angry, on its. And if we

03:18:18.502 --> 03:18:26.558
"leave now, the Herd may survive. But I haven't
heard of a dragon that when crossed lets that

03:18:26.558 --> 03:18:37.732
"vengeance fly. And I'll be honest with you, we
leave a trail behind us, as you know."

03:18:37.732 --> 03:18:41.828
TRAVIS: That I do. It is a wide wake, my friend.

03:18:41.828 --> 03:18:49.211
MATT: At this point, the door slams open behind
you guys. You see a muscular man walks in, skin

03:18:49.211 --> 03:18:55.248
sun-scarred and calloused, his long, black hair
clustered in wild, unkempt clumps. A wild elf,

03:18:55.248 --> 03:19:01.638
Tress, who accompanied you to the square naught
but earlier the day before walks in behind him.

03:19:01.638 --> 03:19:10.986
"Ivon, your timing is good. We speak on." At which
point this man steps forward to the table, pushing

03:19:10.986 --> 03:19:20.527
you guys aside and looking directly at Zanror. "We
do not recognize you, Zanror. Kevdak was the

03:19:20.527 --> 03:19:27.645
"Thunderlord who conquered the River Maw, and now
he's dead. You take his title unearned and intend

03:19:27.645 --> 03:19:35.796
"to lead us into suicide against a dragon that even
Kevdak feared. We will not stand for this. The

"River Maw are picking up and leaving. Now. We
return to our fens, to lead our people. You can

03:19:45.265 --> 03:19:55.890
"all die for your own reasons." Zanror leans
forward, very serious, a grave look on his face.

03:19:55.890 --> 03:20:03.155
"Are you saying you're abandoning the Herd?" At
which point you can see there's tension in his

03:20:03.155 --> 03:20:10.163
muscles, and you can see Tress currently reaching
back for a weapon and Ivon, not breaking a sweat,

03:20:10.163 --> 03:20:20.444
leans into his face, square chiseled jaw going,
"Yeah. I guess that's what I'm saying. Herd of

03:20:20.444 --> 03:20:26.514
"Storms is no more if you're going to lead us into
death. We'd rather live on. Back to the lives we

03:20:26.514 --> 03:20:42.310
"had before you came in and mucked it up." "Close
the doors!" Zanror says, and the door shuts behind.

03:20:42.310 --> 03:20:44.053
SAM: Shit.

03:20:44.053 --> 03:20:57.385
MATT: Zanror looks to you. "What do you say, Grog
Strongjaw, slayer of Kevdak, he who raises might

03:20:57.385 --> 03:21:00.447
"against the dragon?"

03:21:00.447 --> 03:21:08.559
TRAVIS: Thunderlord, we back your play.

03:21:08.559 --> 03:21:21.634
MATT: "The rest of you, those who travel this
world afar, outside of our people, where does your

03:21:21.634 --> 03:21:24.632
"allegiance lie?"

03:21:24.632 --> 03:21:30.447
SAM: Well, certainly not with the cowards who're
abandoning you in the face of a tough fight.

03:21:30.447 --> 03:21:37.423
MATT: Ivon turns to you now, eyes red with fury.
"Who're you calling a coward, little man?"

03:21:37.423 --> 03:21:43.507
TRAVIS: Watch where you turn your gaze. It may be
the last movement your head makes attached

03:21:43.507 --> 03:21:44.942
to your body.

03:21:44.942 --> 03:21:46.950
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

03:21:46.950 --> 03:21:52.726
TRAVIS: Oh, that's not good. Ten.

03:21:52.726 --> 03:21:53.865
MATT: Ten.

03:21:53.865 --> 03:21:55.638
SAM: I'm dead.

03:21:55.638 --> 03:22:01.886
MATT: He's still staring at Scanlan. (spits) Spits
right in your face.

03:22:01.886 --> 03:22:04.382
SAM: That's not very nice.

03:22:04.382 --> 03:22:10.294
MATT: "No. It's not. Neither is calling me a
coward."

03:22:10.294 --> 03:22:22.630
SAM: Well, I'm just a guest here, so I don't want
to spill anyone's blood in someone else's throne

03:22:22.630 --> 03:22:26.151
room, so I'll be the bigger man and take a step
back.

03:22:26.151 --> 03:22:35.021
MATT: As you take a step back, he stands back up,
turns to Zanror. "Zanror. Open the door. Let us go

03:22:35.021 --> 03:22:42.152
"live our lives and you can run into whatever
fires you want. The last thing we need is a civil

03:22:42.152 --> 03:22:48.091
"war this morning." What do you say?

03:22:48.091 --> 03:22:50.646
LAURA: How many people do you have with you?

03:22:50.646 --> 03:22:54.130
MATT: Turns to you. "And you are?"

03:22:54.130 --> 03:22:57.052
LAURA: Vex'ahlia.

03:22:57.052 --> 03:23:16.694
MATT: "We take 18 with us, west of the Fens. Let
us be. It's not fair to drag them into this chaos."

03:23:16.694 --> 03:23:37.529
ASHLEY: May I say something? I realize you want to
go and protect your people, but even if you run,

03:23:37.529 --> 03:23:48.785
you guys will eventually come across a dragon that
will kill all of your people. So what if we fight

03:23:48.785 --> 03:23:53.023
together? Because there's strength in numbers.

03:23:53.023 --> 03:23:58.021
SAM: Maybe we should just let them leave.

03:23:58.021 --> 03:24:01.927
MATT: Make a persuasion check. With disadvantage.

03:24:01.927 --> 03:24:03.256
LAURA: Why?

03:24:03.256 --> 03:24:07.413
MATT: Because you're a tiny gnome talking up to a
very burly man who's--

03:24:07.413 --> 03:24:11.407
ASHLEY: Yeah, but I have Gnome Cunning--
charisma--

03:24:11.407 --> 03:24:13.694
MATT: Right. Go ahead and make your roll.

03:24:13.694 --> 03:24:16.243
ASHLEY: So I have advantage on charismas.

03:24:16.243 --> 03:24:18.833
MATT: On charismas?

03:24:18.833 --> 03:24:22.840
(laughter)

03:24:22.840 --> 03:24:24.440
TRAVIS: Pike.

03:24:24.440 --> 03:24:27.005
ASHLEY: I do! Gnome Cunning-- Advantage on all
intelligence, wisdom, and charisma.

03:24:27.005 --> 03:24:28.765
SAM: Saves.

03:24:28.765 --> 03:24:30.427
LAURA: Saving throws.

03:24:30.427 --> 03:24:33.449
ASHLEY: Oh yes, I didn't read the rest of it.

03:24:33.449 --> 03:24:35.836
MATT: Yeah. That's not really going to help with
that, unfortunately.

03:24:35.836 --> 03:24:36.987
ASHLEY: All right, so persuasion?

03:24:36.987 --> 03:24:38.345
MATT: This is persuasion.

03:24:38.345 --> 03:24:49.817
ASHLEY: Little persuashe? All right, that's a 20.
Fuck. Nine? Hah, he laughs.

03:24:49.817 --> 03:24:58.451
MATT: "It's interesting, Zanror, I walk into here
and suddenly all the tiny people are talking for

03:24:58.451 --> 03:25:02.426
"you. Tress, let's go."

03:25:02.426 --> 03:25:05.973
LIAM: I'm a head taller. Talk to me.

03:25:05.973 --> 03:25:09.398
MATT: "I ain't got time for this shit anymore."

03:25:09.398 --> 03:25:19.061
LIAM: Make time. Blade out. Those dragons are
going to find you and me and everyone in this

03:25:19.061 --> 03:25:25.383
room, whether we fight them now or later. The only
stupid thing we can do is separate ourselves from

03:25:25.383 --> 03:25:33.588
each other-- yeah, keep twitching, twitchy. I
don't want to fight this dragon today either, but

03:25:33.588 --> 03:25:40.885
stupider than that is splitting this group of
powerful motherfuckers apart. I'd rather walk away

03:25:40.885 --> 03:25:44.923
from here, I'd rather take everyone out of this
city and build our strength and come back and

03:25:44.923 --> 03:25:52.284
hobble this beast, but the stupidest thing you
could do right now is separate yourself from the

03:25:52.284 --> 03:25:57.806
Herd. You make yourself weaker, you don't have
them to protect you while you're in the fields

03:25:57.806 --> 03:26:06.113
alone while that dragon belches shit on you from
above. You're strong. These fucking guys are

03:26:06.113 --> 03:26:13.629
strong. We need to be smart. Your strength is shit
compared to that dragon. Shit.

03:26:13.629 --> 03:26:18.201
MATT: "And your tiny people are going to do
better?"

03:26:18.201 --> 03:26:21.916
LAURA: Our tiny people are pretty fucking
powerful.

03:26:21.916 --> 03:26:23.751
ASHLEY: We've already killed dragons.

03:26:23.751 --> 03:26:28.240
SAM: I'm getting pretty sick and tired of being
called tiny. Listen, I don't want to--

03:26:28.240 --> 03:26:29.733
MATT: "Killed dragons?"

03:26:29.733 --> 03:26:34.154
ASHLEY: I pull out my necklace with the tooth on
it.

03:26:34.154 --> 03:26:42.516
MATT: "Lemme see that." He pulls it forward and
looks it over. "Can buy that in any caravan that

03:26:42.516 --> 03:26:43.784
"passes through."

03:26:43.784 --> 03:26:45.349
LAURA: We killed a white dragon, motherfucker.

03:26:45.349 --> 03:26:48.297
ASHLEY: I spit at his feet.

03:26:48.297 --> 03:26:53.642
SAM: Oi! Forget it, guys, why are we trying-- Why
are we trying to convince this asshole to fight

03:26:53.642 --> 03:26:56.390
with us? Let's just let him leave, he's a coward.

03:26:56.390 --> 03:27:01.706
MARISHA: Zanror, if he doesn't have your
allegiance in this room, he will not have your

03:27:01.706 --> 03:27:12.810
allegiance on the battlefield, let them go. Only
big men talk big words that only fail on the

03:27:12.810 --> 03:27:21.821
battlefield. He has nothing to represent any of
his claims. Let him go.

03:27:21.821 --> 03:27:26.300
LIAM: The only difference between you and us is
that we want to actually kill this thing. You want

03:27:26.300 --> 03:27:27.612
to be a prick.

03:27:27.612 --> 03:27:35.584
MARISHA: Zanror-- Zanror, it's not worth losing
any of your men before we fight this dragon, just

03:27:35.584 --> 03:27:39.778
let them go. You're already losing 18.

03:27:39.778 --> 03:27:49.924
MATT: "Open the door." The door slowly opens
behind them. "All right, Ivon, you want to leave?

03:27:49.924 --> 03:27:59.012
"Go. Take your people. But you better go now.
Because when we're done cutting that dragon down

03:27:59.012 --> 03:28:11.416
"we're going to come after you. Deserters. Or you
can come to this fight with us. Yes, these

03:28:11.416 --> 03:28:22.887
"dragon-slayers, he who fell from the sky and cut
the uncuttable down-- we will gloriously bathe in

03:28:22.887 --> 03:28:30.978
"the blood of that beast, take back the spoils that
we fed it. You can do what you please. I have no

03:28:30.978 --> 03:28:43.924
"interest in lording over you." Looks about the
rest of you. "I've got your arms at my back for

03:28:43.924 --> 03:28:47.322
"this. Aye?"

03:28:47.322 --> 03:28:50.139
TRAVIS, ASHLEY, and LAURA: Aye.

03:28:50.139 --> 03:29:02.846
MATT: Tress puts her hand to the side. Ivon looks
at her.

03:29:02.846 --> 03:29:11.666
"We'll take our chances with the wild." Turns
around and exits the room.

03:29:11.666 --> 03:29:17.957
ASHLEY: As Ivon starts going out, I want to trip
him. Stick my foot out.

03:29:17.957 --> 03:29:19.651
MARISHA: Oh my god.

03:29:19.651 --> 03:29:21.500
MATT: All right. Okay.

03:29:21.500 --> 03:29:23.769
TRAVIS: Wars have been started over less.

03:29:23.769 --> 03:29:25.846
ASHLEY: It'll probably fail.

03:29:25.846 --> 03:29:31.374
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength check. Plus
four to your roll, is what it'd be.

03:29:31.374 --> 03:29:38.663
ASHLEY: 12.

03:29:38.663 --> 03:29:44.391
MATT: (stumbling) Catches himself. Shoots you a
look.

03:29:44.391 --> 03:29:47.148
ASHLEY: Sorry, I'm so small. You probably just
didn't see me.

03:29:47.148 --> 03:29:51.761
(laughter)

03:29:51.761 --> 03:29:53.621
MATT: They both exit out the door.

03:29:53.621 --> 03:29:56.484
LIAM: Have fun melting in (trails off) acid-- and
they're gone.

03:29:56.484 --> 03:29:57.849
MATT: Door closes.

03:29:57.849 --> 03:29:59.065
ASHLEY: Dick.

03:29:59.065 --> 03:30:04.833
MATT: "Sorry about that. So."

03:30:04.833 --> 03:30:07.347
LAURA: How many do you have left? After they
left.

03:30:07.347 --> 03:30:14.972
MATT: "18... you're looking at about 25 strong.
We have more wounded, but they're not going to be

03:30:14.972 --> 03:30:16.396
"of use in this battle."

03:30:16.396 --> 03:30:17.910
LAURA: 25.

03:30:17.910 --> 03:30:19.799
MATT: "25 strong people."

03:30:19.799 --> 03:30:24.333
SAM: Does that include your wife?

03:30:24.333 --> 03:30:30.143
MATT:: "No, she's not--" And she turns around and
goes, "I will fight in this. You are not going to

03:30:30.143 --> 03:30:45.791
"keep me from glory." He goes, "She will fight with
us."

03:30:45.791 --> 03:30:54.794
TRAVIS: Aye, she will. 25 strong we have. Injured
are no good to us. Neither are the prisoners or

03:30:54.794 --> 03:31:01.443
hostages that were kept by this herd. You said you
have made preparations. What sort of preparations

03:31:01.443 --> 03:31:03.938
do you have in mind?

03:31:03.938 --> 03:31:15.888
MATT: "Well, the creature sleeps at the top of
Gatshadow. We've acquired an ally in this city

03:31:15.888 --> 03:31:22.744
"that seems to know a secret byway to get to the
side of that cavern. I figure that way we can go

03:31:22.744 --> 03:31:26.879
"ahead and take the fight to it where it sleeps,
when it's not ready."

03:31:26.879 --> 03:31:30.017
TRAVIS: Interesting.

03:31:30.017 --> 03:31:33.791
MATT: "Can't fly if it's stuck in a cave."

03:31:33.791 --> 03:31:37.350
TRAVIS: Very true. Have you seen this cave?

03:31:37.350 --> 03:31:43.039
MATT: "Only from afar, but we have some scouts
that are making their way there right now."

03:31:43.039 --> 03:31:47.276
TRAVIS: Might report back with how-- the size of
the cave.

03:31:47.276 --> 03:31:49.680
MATT: "Should know soon."

03:31:49.680 --> 03:31:55.925
MARISHA: If I'm not mistaken, I recall hearing
that no scouts that have been sent thus far have

03:31:55.925 --> 03:31:57.824
returned, is that correct?

03:31:57.824 --> 03:31:59.287
MATT: "That is correct."

03:31:59.287 --> 03:32:02.570
MARISHA: And you have faith that these that you
sent will?

03:32:02.570 --> 03:32:04.979
MATT: "It's better than not."

03:32:04.979 --> 03:32:12.875
TRAVIS: Do you have any interest in a tactical
ambush?

03:32:12.875 --> 03:32:17.952
MATT: "I'm all ears. What have you got?"

03:32:17.952 --> 03:32:21.323
MARISHA: When's it due for its next pickup?

03:32:21.323 --> 03:32:26.321
MATT: "Tomorrow morning, just after dawn."

03:32:26.321 --> 03:32:36.389
MARISHA: Wait 24 hours, Pike and I can take time,
and Scanlan, to heal some of your wounded, gain a

03:32:36.389 --> 03:32:40.266
couple more to the fight. We set a trap in the
morning.

03:32:40.266 --> 03:32:42.210
MATT: "What kind of trap?"

03:32:42.210 --> 03:32:44.410
LAURA: Something that explodes it?

03:32:44.410 --> 03:32:45.773
MARISHA: Something big.

03:32:45.773 --> 03:32:47.125
LAURA: Something that traps it?

03:32:47.125 --> 03:32:48.401
MARISHA: Something heavy.

03:32:48.401 --> 03:32:56.340
TALIESIN: Something, even in theory, that we could
convince it to take back to its lair. If we still

03:32:56.340 --> 03:33:02.691
wanted to go with that, we could load the next
parcel with something--

03:33:02.691 --> 03:33:04.441
SAM: Or someone.

03:33:04.441 --> 03:33:06.584
LIAM: Would three days be better than one, Percival?

03:33:06.584 --> 03:33:10.922
TALIESIN: A month would be better than a week--

03:33:10.922 --> 03:33:12.933
TRAVIS: Don't have that. One thing dragons--

03:33:12.933 --> 03:33:14.333
TALIESIN: Yes, three days would always be better
than one.

03:33:14.333 --> 03:33:21.556
TRAVIS: Dragons and Kevdak shared one common
trait: arrogance. In your previous dealings with

03:33:21.556 --> 03:33:26.143
this dragon, did it ever speak down to you?

03:33:26.143 --> 03:33:36.478
MATT: "Huh. That's the only way it knows how to
speak. Fucking cold-minded beast."

03:33:36.478 --> 03:33:38.083
TRAVIS: Aye.

03:33:38.083 --> 03:33:40.449
MATT: "Can't wait to sever its head from its
neck."

03:33:40.449 --> 03:33:47.952
TRAVIS: Perhaps if we tame your lust for blood for
a day, we can control all the variables that we

03:33:47.952 --> 03:33:56.203
have by setting this trap. If we go to that cave,
aye, we will find war sooner, but we know less,

03:33:56.203 --> 03:34:02.444
and the reason you're the Thunderlord now is there
is a better brain in that skull than there ever

03:34:02.444 --> 03:34:06.859
was in your father's. Let's use that to our
advantage.

03:34:06.859 --> 03:34:12.845
MATT: Make a persuasion check. Does anyone want to
aid?

03:34:12.845 --> 03:34:14.516
TRAVIS: Don't need it.

03:34:14.516 --> 03:34:16.513
LAURA: (sings) He doesn't need it.

03:34:16.513 --> 03:34:18.696
TRAVIS: 19.

03:34:18.696 --> 03:34:22.251
SAM: He might need it.

03:34:22.251 --> 03:34:36.101
MATT: Takes a moment. "We'll take your day. Set
what you need. We'll go ahead and call the troops

03:34:36.101 --> 03:34:46.562
"off for the day. Heal our wounded. Let's make this
such a majestic death for this terrible creature."

03:34:46.562 --> 03:34:55.768
MARISHA: Zanror-- I think Percy just had an idea,
but Vex'ahlia knows a lot about dragons. She might

03:34:55.768 --> 03:35:01.669
be good to educate the troops. Also, as Grog
mentioned, we have people who could be very

03:35:01.669 --> 03:35:06.063
valuable allies that your people have imprisoned.
It would behoove you to release them so that they

03:35:06.063 --> 03:35:13.502
can join our side. Conversely, any other type of
magical enhancements that you can use to arm

03:35:13.502 --> 03:35:15.387
against acid?

03:35:15.387 --> 03:35:16.472
LAURA: Acid.

03:35:16.472 --> 03:35:22.205
MARISHA: For any and all of your troops, it's
definitely suggested.

03:35:22.205 --> 03:35:27.401
MATT: "I'll talk to our Speakers. They should be
able to mount what they can. Acid, you say?"

03:35:27.401 --> 03:35:28.524
LAURA: Yes.

03:35:28.524 --> 03:35:30.509
MATT: "Okay. We'll do that."

03:35:30.509 --> 03:35:31.764
LAURA: You'll release the prisoners?

03:35:31.764 --> 03:35:40.315
MATT: "Would like one of you to at least go with
them, but aye, we can do that. All right. Let's

03:35:40.315 --> 03:35:44.565
"begin our planning, for tomorrow we kill a
dragon."

03:35:44.565 --> 03:35:46.326
LAURA: We totally planned at dawn!

03:35:46.326 --> 03:35:48.903

03:36:00.969 --> 03:36:02.061
ASHLEY: At dawn, we plan.

next week, but-- it's okay, I'll be, I'll try--

03:36:06.517 --> 03:36:08.725
LIAM: Where're you going, brainiac?

03:36:08.725 --> 03:36:10.869
TALIESIN: To Hawaii.

03:36:10.869 --> 03:36:12.051
MATT: We can Skype you in.

03:36:12.051 --> 03:36:17.784
TALIESIN: I can Skype in. I'll try and Skype in.
