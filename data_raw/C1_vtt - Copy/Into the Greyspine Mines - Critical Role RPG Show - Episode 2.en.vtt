00:00:00.451 --> 00:00:02.467
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome
to the second episode

00:00:02.467 --> 00:00:04.638
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:06.500
crazy voice actor, nerdy types sit here

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.650
and play Dungeons and Dragons.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.681
We'll be continuing from
last week's adventure,

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:11.388
so in the meantime, let's
go ahead and show you some

00:00:11.388 --> 00:00:13.593
of the character backstory.

00:00:13.593 --> 00:00:15.229
TRAVIS: Right, listen up.

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:19.396
If you have ale, then you have
a friend in Grog Strongjaw.

00:00:20.912 --> 00:00:24.440
A goliath of towering height and size,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.411
this barbarian has an appetite
for the two great loves

00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:31.411
in his life: combat, women, and ale.

00:00:33.578 --> 00:00:34.864
(record scratching)

00:00:34.864 --> 00:00:35.697
Wait.

00:00:35.697 --> 00:00:38.939
Easily the brains of
the group, Grog is often

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:42.780
consulted for his vast
knowledge of shapes, colors,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.197
and shiny things.

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:46.274
Also ale.

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:51.530
In his early years, armed
with his two-handed greataxe,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.276
Grog oft enjoyed proving
his might amongst the ranks

00:00:54.276 --> 00:00:57.024
of his family's wandering herd,

00:00:57.024 --> 00:01:00.091
but after coming upon an
unsuspecting elderly gnome

00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:02.794
in the woods, he objected to the killing

00:01:02.794 --> 00:01:05.610
of such an innocent life.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.060
A creature of impulse, Grog
felt only pity for this,

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.953
(chuckles) this terrified little thing.

00:01:13.953 --> 00:01:17.028
His disobedience cost him dearly.

00:01:17.028 --> 00:01:20.519
Beaten bloody and banished
by the herd leader,

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:24.686
his uncle Kevdak, Grog was
abandoned and left to die.

00:01:25.622 --> 00:01:29.062
Exiled from his herd, it
was then that the relative

00:01:29.062 --> 00:01:32.979
of the very gnome he
fought to save, saved him.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.751
It was the kindness of a
gnome cleric named Pike

00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:41.837
that healed Grog, bringing
him back from death's edge.

00:01:41.837 --> 00:01:45.502
And they have remained
close friends ever since.

00:01:45.502 --> 00:01:49.341
Most nights, Grog can be found
challenging entire taverns

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:51.505
to wrestling matches, ha!

00:01:51.505 --> 00:01:54.224
Or accompanying Scanlan
to the nearest house

00:01:54.224 --> 00:01:57.141
where you pay for lady favors, huh.

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:59.562
Also ale.

00:02:01.331 --> 00:02:02.792
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth

00:02:02.792 --> 00:02:04.511
would leave you with little information

00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:06.326
on the half-elven druid.

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.625
You might even think that
her social awkwardness

00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:11.962
due to her sheltered
upbringing is kind of sweet.

00:02:11.962 --> 00:02:15.591
Of course, it would be
unwise to underestimate her

00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:16.961
based on first impressions.

00:02:16.961 --> 00:02:18.657
(lightning roaring)

00:02:18.657 --> 00:02:21.114
Under that unintimidating, petite frame

00:02:21.114 --> 00:02:23.749
is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:25.957
whose natural powers have
made even the fiercest

00:02:25.957 --> 00:02:30.653
of champions pee their
pants, literally. (giggles)

00:02:30.653 --> 00:02:33.450
Born to the air tribe
of the Ashari people,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.019
Keyleth was raised with
a deep love of nature

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.065
and the elemental magics.

00:02:38.065 --> 00:02:39.748
It is her people's inherent duty

00:02:39.748 --> 00:02:42.542
to protect the delicate
areas in Tal'Dorei,

00:02:42.542 --> 00:02:44.918
where the four elemental
planes begins to bleed

00:02:44.918 --> 00:02:46.708
with this realm.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.907
Since she was a little
girl, she had quite a knack

00:02:48.907 --> 00:02:52.455
for air manipulation and
beastshaping abilities.

00:02:52.455 --> 00:02:55.259
Well, if you consider
kittens and flying squirrels

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:57.209
to be little beasts,

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.371
which I do.

00:02:58.371 --> 00:02:59.204
(clears throat)

00:02:59.204 --> 00:03:02.522
Anyways, it wasn't long before
the headmaster of the tribe,

00:03:02.522 --> 00:03:06.185
her father, Kohren, realized
her true prodigious abilities

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:08.354
and she was inveterated to succeed him

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:10.895
as the next headmaster.

00:03:10.895 --> 00:03:13.652
Just like that, her jovial
childhood was stripped

00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:16.450
and replaced with endless
spell memorization,

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.177
teachings from ancient traditions,

00:03:18.177 --> 00:03:20.970
and exceedingly high expectations.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.531
Every druid leader-to-be
must embark on a journey

00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.269
to seek out the sister
tribes in order to introduce

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.835
and establish respect amongst
the fellow headmasters.

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:34.142
They call this the
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey.

00:03:34.142 --> 00:03:36.816
When her father felt she was
ready, he set her on the path

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:39.078
to truly discovering herself.

00:03:39.078 --> 00:03:42.725
Not knowing when, or if,
she will ever return.

00:03:42.725 --> 00:03:45.319
As she hikes down the
mountain towards Stillben,

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.837
she meditated on the task ahead.

00:03:47.837 --> 00:03:51.283
Part of the Aramente is proving
yourself a strong warrior,

00:03:51.283 --> 00:03:55.771
a valiant protector, and a
wise and compassionate leader.

00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:58.666
With this knowledge, one
thought plays in repeat

00:03:58.666 --> 00:03:59.666
in her mind:

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:02.958
Is she even worthy?

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.323
TALIESIN: Percy was the third child

00:04:06.323 --> 00:04:08.806
of seven children, born to a noble family

00:04:08.806 --> 00:04:10.251
who lived far to the north

00:04:10.251 --> 00:04:12.944
in the ancient castle of Whitestone.

00:04:12.944 --> 00:04:15.734
With so many siblings to
share the burdens of lordship,

00:04:15.734 --> 00:04:16.774
Percy turned his attention

00:04:16.774 --> 00:04:20.346
to the sciences,
engineering, and naturalism.

00:04:20.346 --> 00:04:24.539
One day, a mysterious couple
named Lord and Lady Briarwood

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.119
came to court.

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:28.614
During a feast held in
their honour, the Briarwoods

00:04:28.614 --> 00:04:31.309
violently took control
of the castle, killing

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:35.109
or imprisoning everyone who
would stand in their way.

00:04:35.109 --> 00:04:37.819
Percy awoke chained in the
dungeon, only to be freed

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.005
by his younger sister.

00:04:40.005 --> 00:04:43.322
Together they fled, chased
by the Briarwoods' men.

00:04:43.322 --> 00:04:45.873
As they ran, Percy's
sister took several arrows

00:04:45.873 --> 00:04:48.472
to the chest and fell.

00:04:48.472 --> 00:04:51.427
Percy kept running, eventually
jumping into a freezing river

00:04:51.427 --> 00:04:54.346
and floating unconscious to freedom.

00:04:54.346 --> 00:04:56.947
He did not remember waking
up on a fishing boat.

00:04:56.947 --> 00:04:59.285
He barely remembered the next two years,

00:04:59.285 --> 00:05:03.289
as he slowly made his way
as far south as possible.

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.992
Then one night, Percy had a dream.

00:05:05.992 --> 00:05:08.924
A roaring cloud of smoke
offered him vengeance

00:05:08.924 --> 00:05:11.755
against those who destroyed his family.

00:05:11.755 --> 00:05:16.010
When he awoke, Percy began
to design his first gun.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.843
(gun clicking)

00:05:16.843 --> 00:05:19.135
(explosion roaring)

00:05:19.135 --> 00:05:20.219
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:22.200
of Scanlan Shorthalt?

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.770
Well, gird your loins, ladies,

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.971
because he has his eye on you.

00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:27.893
A talented musician, master of disguise,

00:05:27.893 --> 00:05:30.329
and dashingly handsome in his own mind,

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:32.634
Scanlan sings songs almost as much

00:05:32.634 --> 00:05:34.987
as he sings his own praises.

00:05:34.987 --> 00:05:38.284
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan
used his endless charm

00:05:38.284 --> 00:05:40.976
and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin

00:05:40.976 --> 00:05:42.912
and support his single mother.

00:05:42.912 --> 00:05:45.681
One day he was discovered
by a half-orc promoter,

00:05:45.681 --> 00:05:49.439
and joined Dr. Dranzel's
Spectacular Traveling Troupe,

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:51.270
where he learned the ways of the world,

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.799
and honed his skills as
a bard extraordinaire.

00:05:55.799 --> 00:05:58.189
A loner much of his life,
Scanlan has never quite

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:00.356
come to terms with the
violent death of his mother

00:06:00.356 --> 00:06:02.719
at the hands of a goblin invasion.

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:06.001
While his years on the road
provided many, shall we say,

00:06:06.001 --> 00:06:09.449
educational experiences
with the opposite sex,

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.051
deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing

00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:16.783
he's never known, the true
love of a fellow gnome.

00:06:16.783 --> 00:06:19.994
Still, Scanlan considers
himself a lover first,

00:06:19.994 --> 00:06:23.599
performer second, and
fighter distant third.

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.838
On the battlefield,
he'll support his allies,

00:06:25.838 --> 00:06:28.160
but rarely draws blood unless it's

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.771
to protect fellow gnome, Pike.

00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:34.074
Count on Scanlan for a hearty
laugh, a rollicking song,

00:06:34.074 --> 00:06:36.544
and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

00:06:36.544 --> 00:06:38.877
and makes the females swoon.

00:06:40.536 --> 00:06:43.456
ORION: Greetings and salutations.

00:06:43.456 --> 00:06:46.010
I am Tiberius Stormwind.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.201
I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:50.336
located in the heart of Draconia,

00:06:50.336 --> 00:06:52.495
from a politically respected family.

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:54.278
At the age of 15, I succeeded

00:06:54.278 --> 00:06:56.104
in passing the Sorcerer's Rite,

00:06:56.104 --> 00:06:58.131
showing prodigy-like control of my magic.

00:06:58.131 --> 00:07:00.828
The judges and the Draconian
high council were amazed

00:07:00.828 --> 00:07:02.617
at how powerful my spells were

00:07:02.617 --> 00:07:04.491
for how long I had been training.

00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:06.990
At 20 years old, I was the
youngest appointed member

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.808
of the magic guild in Draconian history.

00:07:09.808 --> 00:07:11.447
For the next few years, I almost went mad

00:07:11.447 --> 00:07:13.679
from the malaise of being a guild member,

00:07:13.679 --> 00:07:16.176
as it's rather boring.

00:07:16.176 --> 00:07:18.656
However, one day I
happened upon a chamber,

00:07:18.656 --> 00:07:20.666
unused for quite some time.

00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:22.710
In the room were stacks of books and maps

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.554
of the surrounding cities and
areas around the known world.

00:07:25.554 --> 00:07:28.037
For months I would frequent the chamber,

00:07:28.037 --> 00:07:30.257
and learned of artifacts from legend.

00:07:30.257 --> 00:07:33.112
After a long period of research,
I made a list of artifacts

00:07:33.112 --> 00:07:34.771
that caught my eye.

00:07:34.771 --> 00:07:36.646
I brought these findings
to the high council

00:07:36.646 --> 00:07:39.102
and was told that all of the
information in the chamber

00:07:39.102 --> 00:07:41.707
I stumbled upon was either
believed to be fiction,

00:07:41.707 --> 00:07:45.929
or unsolvable mysteries,
and hence were lost forever.

00:07:45.929 --> 00:07:48.829
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

00:07:48.829 --> 00:07:51.093
A year later I devised a ruse and managed

00:07:51.093 --> 00:07:52.761
to convince the city
council to lend support

00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:55.969
in me leaving Draconia on a
mission of peace and diplomacy

00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:57.699
for the surrounding kingdoms.

00:07:57.699 --> 00:08:00.018
Going from town to town and
making friends and allies,

00:08:00.018 --> 00:08:01.828
in and for the name of Draconia.

00:08:01.828 --> 00:08:05.871
Being a red dragonborn, I had
quite the task on my hands

00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:08.690
in that respect, but it
was exactly what I needed,

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.556
so I could explore the world
and find these artifacts,

00:08:11.556 --> 00:08:14.255
as I felt the truth was out there.

00:08:14.255 --> 00:08:16.671
Some may describe me as buffoonish,

00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:19.022
but I say poppycock to all that. (mutters)

00:08:19.022 --> 00:08:21.420
I am much sharper than
most give me credit for.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.463
I just don't pay attention
to things sometimes.

00:08:24.463 --> 00:08:27.222
I've also been known to
be rather cunning, loyal,

00:08:27.222 --> 00:08:30.222
happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous.

00:08:31.489 --> 00:08:34.596
I can't help but show my true
scales every now and then.

00:08:34.596 --> 00:08:38.763
But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn.

00:08:39.674 --> 00:08:41.224
LIAM: Never entirely
welcome in the company

00:08:41.224 --> 00:08:44.530
of elves or men, Vax'ildan
learned at a young age

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.614
to skip past formality, preferring instead

00:08:47.614 --> 00:08:50.275
to invite himself in your door.

00:08:50.275 --> 00:08:53.091
Along with twin sister
Vex'ahlia, Vax was born

00:08:53.091 --> 00:08:55.786
by a chance encounter
between elven royalty

00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:57.836
and human peasantry.

00:08:57.836 --> 00:09:00.408
Raised by their mother
in their early years,

00:09:00.408 --> 00:09:02.548
the twins were eventually
sent off to their father

00:09:02.548 --> 00:09:04.849
in the elven capital of Syngorn.

00:09:04.849 --> 00:09:08.036
But their cool reception among
the elves there never warmed,

00:09:08.036 --> 00:09:10.986
and their time in the capital didn't last.

00:09:10.986 --> 00:09:13.094
The siblings stole away one autumn night

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:15.986
and set out on the open road.

00:09:15.986 --> 00:09:18.638
After a few years of wandering,
they eventually decided

00:09:18.638 --> 00:09:21.021
to return to their
mother, and journeyed back

00:09:21.021 --> 00:09:23.100
to the lands of their youth.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.792
But instead of finding
their childhood home,

00:09:25.792 --> 00:09:28.620
they returned to a pile of rubble.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.298
Their mother was gone,
their home burned to ash.

00:09:32.298 --> 00:09:34.785
Pressing the townspeople for answers,

00:09:34.785 --> 00:09:37.108
they learned of the day the dragon came.

00:09:37.108 --> 00:09:39.691
(loud roaring)

00:09:40.942 --> 00:09:44.198
With their ties all severed,
Vax'ildan and his sister

00:09:44.198 --> 00:09:48.160
set out to find their fortune
together in Tal'Dorei.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.026
An outsider since birth,
Vax quickly learned

00:09:51.026 --> 00:09:55.228
to solve life's challenges
in his own particular way,

00:09:55.228 --> 00:09:57.988
often by sidestepping them entirely.

00:09:57.988 --> 00:10:01.680
And when his knack for circumventing
adversity isn't enough,

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.404
(sword slicing)

00:10:03.404 --> 00:10:05.813
the way of blades the
elves schooled him in

00:10:05.813 --> 00:10:08.843
more than makes up the difference.

00:10:08.843 --> 00:10:11.416
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia

00:10:11.416 --> 00:10:14.555
has spent most of her life
suffering the cool reception

00:10:14.555 --> 00:10:18.021
of a people who don't fully accept her.

00:10:18.021 --> 00:10:21.017
Born of a human mother
and an elven father,

00:10:21.017 --> 00:10:24.084
who only later in life took an
interest in their existence,

00:10:24.084 --> 00:10:27.120
Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.299
quickly realized the only
people they could truly rely on

00:10:31.299 --> 00:10:34.440
in this world were each other.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.741
It was at the age of ten
when the two were taken

00:10:36.741 --> 00:10:39.947
from their mother, and
brought to live in Syngorn,

00:10:39.947 --> 00:10:42.252
the isolated elven city
for which their father

00:10:42.252 --> 00:10:43.994
was an ambassador.

00:10:43.994 --> 00:10:47.974
He quietly took them in, but
always kept an icy distance,

00:10:47.974 --> 00:10:50.889
and after too many years
of disdainful looks,

00:10:50.889 --> 00:10:54.320
the pair decided to leave
his indifference behind,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.877
and set out on their own.

00:10:56.877 --> 00:11:00.308
Vax took to the cities,
stealing small trinkets

00:11:00.308 --> 00:11:02.900
and learning the ways of the thief,

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.528
while Vex kept to the woods.

00:11:05.528 --> 00:11:07.980
She preferred the isolation.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.344
Always the keen observer, she
learned to hunt and to track,

00:11:12.344 --> 00:11:14.768
to spy and to shoot.

00:11:14.768 --> 00:11:17.282
And through a series of fateful events,

00:11:17.282 --> 00:11:20.819
earned herself a companion
in the form of a bear,

00:11:20.819 --> 00:11:23.204
her own stolen trinket,

00:11:23.204 --> 00:11:24.037
(bear growling)

00:11:24.037 --> 00:11:25.013
to fight alongside her

00:11:25.013 --> 00:11:27.450
and protect her fiercely.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:31.367
Also, he is adorable and
gives expert massages.

00:11:32.752 --> 00:11:33.894
Welcome back everyone.

00:11:33.894 --> 00:11:35.221
So, know that you're a
little more affiliated

00:11:35.221 --> 00:11:38.431
with the characters, let's
get this party started.

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:40.474
So as a head's up, I wanna let you know,

00:11:40.474 --> 00:11:42.271
once again, we're waiting
for the charity elements

00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:44.379
of this stream to open up
again, since the big charity

00:11:44.379 --> 00:11:45.495
that happened a couple weeks ago.

00:11:45.495 --> 00:11:48.381
Once we do, we're gonna
be taking donations,

00:11:48.381 --> 00:11:49.649
half to go to help run the channel,

00:11:49.649 --> 00:11:52.593
the other to donate to 826.

00:11:52.593 --> 00:11:55.569
Marisha will explain that
here in just a second.

00:11:55.569 --> 00:11:59.277
As a head's up, Ashley,
who plays our cleric, Pike,

00:11:59.277 --> 00:12:01.555
unfortunately couldn't
make it again this week,

00:12:01.555 --> 00:12:03.643
because she's busy filming amazing stuff

00:12:03.643 --> 00:12:04.921
with her career being amazing.

00:12:04.921 --> 00:12:07.520
But she says she's sad she can't be here.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.353
She loves you guys,

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:09.289
and as soon as Pike can
re-enter the campaign,

00:12:09.289 --> 00:12:10.888
hopefully in a couple weeks,

00:12:10.888 --> 00:12:13.772
all awesome gnomeness shall double.

00:12:13.772 --> 00:12:16.234
So also tonight, there was a goal to try

00:12:16.234 --> 00:12:18.497
and hit 1000 subscribers on the channel.

00:12:18.497 --> 00:12:20.433
So what we're gonna do is,
we only have 130 people

00:12:20.433 --> 00:12:21.712
to subscribe tonight.

00:12:21.712 --> 00:12:23.988
If we can get all 130 before
the show ends this evening,

00:12:23.988 --> 00:12:25.822
we're gonna do a random selection

00:12:25.822 --> 00:12:28.264
of a person within those
thousand subscribers

00:12:28.264 --> 00:12:31.416
to win a copy of the Player's
Handbook signed by all of us,

00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:32.936
as well as a really, really cool image

00:12:32.936 --> 00:12:34.678
that was tweeted out earlier
by Geek &amp;amp; Sundry,

00:12:34.678 --> 00:12:36.411
also signed by all of us.

00:12:36.411 --> 00:12:37.953
So, go ahead and pull your friends,

00:12:37.953 --> 00:12:39.191
see if we can get some more subscribers

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:40.954
before the show's out tonight, so

00:12:40.954 --> 00:12:42.760
hopefully that'll be fun.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.618
So, Marisha, if you wanna go
ahead and explain a little bit

00:12:45.618 --> 00:12:48.990
about the charity 826 we'll be
plugging in the near future.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.268
Yes, 826 LA is a non-profit
charity organization

00:12:52.268 --> 00:12:55.353
that helps kids though
the age of six to 18

00:12:55.353 --> 00:12:59.340
with their creative and
structural writing skills,

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.423
and they also help teachers and yeah.

00:13:03.412 --> 00:13:05.396
Good artsy creative things.

00:13:05.396 --> 00:13:07.750
So donate, and definitely
visit the Time Travel Mart.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:08.583
SAM: Wait, can we donate?

00:13:08.583 --> 00:13:10.060
MATT: Tonight we can't donate here.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.179
MARISHA: We can't donate tonight yet?

00:13:11.179 --> 00:13:12.428
MATT: It's not available yet.

00:13:12.428 --> 00:13:13.261
Start saving your money.

00:13:13.261 --> 00:13:14.094
SAM: Not yet.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.222
MARISHA: But you can still go to the
Time Travel Mart in Echo Park

00:13:17.222 --> 00:13:20.347
and you can also go to
their website, 826LA,

00:13:20.347 --> 00:13:21.818
and I'm sure you can donate through there

00:13:21.818 --> 00:13:22.651
if you want to do that.

00:13:22.651 --> 00:13:24.674
MATT: Yes, but we'll be getting
that going in the near future.

00:13:25.507 --> 00:13:26.340
So, anyway.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.173
Let's go ahead and do a little recap

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:28.006
of what happened last week.

00:13:28.006 --> 00:13:30.139
So the party has been
hired by their friend,

00:13:30.139 --> 00:13:33.286
Arcanist Allura Vysoren,
in the city of Emon

00:13:33.286 --> 00:13:36.154
to head towards the
dwarven town of Kraghammer,

00:13:36.154 --> 00:13:37.662
as a good friend of hers,
and one of the members

00:13:37.662 --> 00:13:40.560
of the Council of
Tal'Dorei, has gone missing.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.979
This, being a halfling paladin,
named Lady Kima of Vord,

00:13:44.979 --> 00:13:46.992
who was on a vision quest
as part of a pilgrimage

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:49.425
and was drawn towards some dark evil

00:13:49.425 --> 00:13:52.138
she said was manifesting
somewhere deep beneath Kraghammer

00:13:52.138 --> 00:13:54.111
and hadn't been heard from since.

00:13:54.111 --> 00:13:56.874
So the party was sent there
to go ahead and seek her.

00:13:56.874 --> 00:13:59.737
Upon arriving in Kraghammer,
shenanigans ensued.

00:13:59.737 --> 00:14:02.222
They made some friends, made some enemies,

00:14:02.222 --> 00:14:03.055
wandered the town.

00:14:03.055 --> 00:14:05.505
Brother, sisters, walked
around as if they were married.

00:14:05.505 --> 00:14:06.338
LAURA: No!

00:14:06.338 --> 00:14:08.109
(group laughs)

00:14:08.109 --> 00:14:10.630
MATT: Bears almost got into fights in rings.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.196
And eventually the party made their way

00:14:13.196 --> 00:14:15.999
towards the bottom ring
of Kraghammer proper,

00:14:15.999 --> 00:14:18.655
talking to Lord Nostoc Greyspine, who is--

00:14:18.655 --> 00:14:20.884
ORION: That's right, Greyspine.

00:14:20.884 --> 00:14:22.264
MATT: Yes, Greyspine indeed.

00:14:22.264 --> 00:14:26.172
Who is the head of the Greyspine Mines

00:14:26.172 --> 00:14:27.245
at the bottom of Kraghammer,

00:14:27.245 --> 00:14:30.096
where supposedly this
paladin disappeared to.

00:14:30.096 --> 00:14:31.720
After having a conversation with him,

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.616
a bunch of goblins and ogres
began to spring from the mines

00:14:34.616 --> 00:14:36.244
and attacking the workers.

00:14:36.244 --> 00:14:39.082
The party swooped down to
aid, realized that the goblins

00:14:39.082 --> 00:14:41.024
and ogre's weren't
attacking, they were fleeing

00:14:41.024 --> 00:14:42.480
from something else,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.829
of which emerging from
within the mines proper

00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:48.246
some strange naga-based
hydra-ish abomination.

00:14:48.246 --> 00:14:49.968
The party then proceeded to slaughter it,

00:14:49.968 --> 00:14:52.281
final blow dealt by
Scanlan via lightning bolt.

00:14:52.281 --> 00:14:53.716
SAM: Hi, Scanlan here, hi.

00:14:53.716 --> 00:14:54.734
MATT: Our resident gnome bard.

00:14:54.734 --> 00:14:55.596
TRAVIS: Yeah, you did!

00:14:55.596 --> 00:14:57.583
MATT: And that's where we pick up.

00:14:57.583 --> 00:14:59.663
So, as all of you are
still riding the adrenaline

00:14:59.663 --> 00:15:02.499
of the battle, Scanlan feeling
the tingling in his fingers

00:15:02.499 --> 00:15:03.500
as the little bolts of
arcane energy kind of

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.034
(imitates electricity
crackling) spark throughout,

00:15:06.034 --> 00:15:08.039
the rest of the nearby workers and miners

00:15:08.039 --> 00:15:09.936
slowly converge in and begin to

00:15:09.936 --> 00:15:11.627
walk up to the party.

00:15:11.627 --> 00:15:14.130
And someone starts, "That was
great, that was well done!

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.286
"Fantastic!

00:15:15.286 --> 00:15:16.276
"Where'd you learn that?"

00:15:16.276 --> 00:15:17.405
One of them comes up there,
"Ah, I could've done

00:15:17.405 --> 00:15:18.330
"better than that."

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:19.505
And they start just
shouting off at each other

00:15:19.505 --> 00:15:20.963
and pat each other on the back.

00:15:20.963 --> 00:15:23.680
A few moments of this progresses before,

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.400
all of a sudden, there's a
hush comes about the crowd,

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.797
and you see about five or six Carvers

00:15:27.797 --> 00:15:29.155
pull their way through,

00:15:29.155 --> 00:15:31.014
Carvers being the guards of Kraghammer,

00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:35.101
with Lord Nostoc Greyspine
himself stepping through.

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:36.798
He looks at the rest
of the group and goes,

00:15:37.631 --> 00:15:40.624
"All right, so you've certainly
proven yourselves in battle."

00:15:40.624 --> 00:15:42.589
ORION: Well, of course we have.

00:15:43.468 --> 00:15:45.056
I'm sorry.

00:15:45.056 --> 00:15:47.220
MATT: "I would like to continue this conversation

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.943
that we had back in my
office if you don't mind."

00:15:50.943 --> 00:15:52.444
He turns around and begins to walk back.

00:15:52.444 --> 00:15:54.336
MARISHA: Oh wait, Nostoc.

00:15:54.336 --> 00:15:55.614
He's not even listening,
he's just walking off.

00:15:55.614 --> 00:15:56.447
(group laughs)

00:15:56.447 --> 00:15:58.086
Yeah, mmm.

00:15:58.086 --> 00:15:58.919
Ooh, shall we turn and follow?

00:15:58.919 --> 00:15:59.752
LAURA: Are you still an eagle?

00:15:59.752 --> 00:16:00.602
Can you even talk to him?

00:16:00.602 --> 00:16:01.435
TALIESIN: Shouldn't you just go caw?

00:16:01.435 --> 00:16:03.983
MARISHA: Well I'm not an eagle.

00:16:03.983 --> 00:16:05.309
But I am still poisoned.

00:16:06.214 --> 00:16:08.374
LAURA: Oh, I can help you.

00:16:08.374 --> 00:16:09.658
MARISHA: Oh, that'd be great.

00:16:09.658 --> 00:16:10.525
LAURA: Yeah!

00:16:11.433 --> 00:16:13.744
LAURA: Hold on, I'm gonna go
up, and I'm gonna cast--

00:16:13.744 --> 00:16:14.740
SAM: Cast?

00:16:14.903 --> 00:16:15.736
Yeah, I can cast spells.

00:16:16.369 --> 00:16:17.342
SAM: You can cast?

00:16:17.342 --> 00:16:19.060
LAURA: I can.
I've got plenty o' spells.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.371
LIAM: You can kill?

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.007
SAM: All right, fair enough.

00:16:23.007 --> 00:16:26.135
LAURA: I'm gonna cast Protection
from Poison on Keyleth.

00:16:26.135 --> 00:16:26.968
MATT: Okay.

00:16:26.968 --> 00:16:31.818
Essentially go ahead and make
a saving throw with advantage.

00:16:31.818 --> 00:16:34.208
This'll be Constitution.

00:16:34.208 --> 00:16:35.638
MARISHA: I made the second one.

00:16:35.638 --> 00:16:36.471
MATT: What'd you roll?

00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:37.310
MARISHA: A 10.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.890
Plus my constitution which
is two, three, thirteen.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:42.723
MATT: So thirteen?

00:16:42.723 --> 00:16:43.556
MARISHA: Yes.

00:16:43.556 --> 00:16:44.389
MATT: That'd be enough.

00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:45.222
So, after you finish casting the spell,

00:16:45.222 --> 00:16:47.643
you feel the poison leave
the rest of your body.

00:16:47.643 --> 00:16:49.794
You can kind of take a breath to yourself.

00:16:49.794 --> 00:16:51.471
The rest of the miners
kind of look about and

00:16:52.304 --> 00:16:54.506
Awkwardly staring back at
Nostoc as he walks off,

00:16:54.506 --> 00:16:56.187
kind of looking back like, what

00:16:56.187 --> 00:16:57.073
"Are you gonna go?

00:16:57.073 --> 00:16:57.906
"Talk to him?"

00:16:57.906 --> 00:16:59.024
SAM: Yeah, I guess we should go follow him.

00:16:59.024 --> 00:17:00.304
TALIESIN: We have two very important questions.

00:17:00.304 --> 00:17:01.423
GROG: Can't we look in the
hole a little bit more.

00:17:01.423 --> 00:17:02.868
ORION: No Grog, we need to go do this.

00:17:02.868 --> 00:17:04.729
LAURA: We're gonna go in the hole
in just a minute, Grog.

00:17:04.729 --> 00:17:05.561
ORION: Then you can smash, you'll be fine.

00:17:05.561 --> 00:17:06.395
TRAVIS: You promise?

00:17:06.395 --> 00:17:07.457
LIAM: You did that last night.

00:17:07.457 --> 00:17:09.553
We need to take care of business.

00:17:09.553 --> 00:17:10.460
Let's go talk to the man.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.029
I'm sure it's going to
lead back to the mines.

00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.862
MARISHA: To the hole.

00:17:13.862 --> 00:17:14.694
LIAM: Yes, to the hole.

00:17:14.694 --> 00:17:15.546
Everything's back to the hole.

00:17:15.546 --> 00:17:16.771
SAM: Percy, do you have something
to say before we go?

00:17:16.771 --> 00:17:18.073
TALIESIN: Well, this is good.

00:17:18.073 --> 00:17:19.324
We have to find out what that was,

00:17:19.324 --> 00:17:20.621
and we have to see if
he'll finally give us

00:17:20.621 --> 00:17:21.733
some of that ale,

00:17:21.733 --> 00:17:23.453
I think are the two most important things.

00:17:23.453 --> 00:17:24.566
LAURA: It was wine, I believe.

00:17:24.566 --> 00:17:26.121
SAM: No, it was bloody, bloody beer.

00:17:26.121 --> 00:17:27.457
LAURA: Bloodline.
Bloody wine, blood wine.

00:17:27.457 --> 00:17:29.027
TRAVIS: Bloodier, ale.
Beerwine.

00:17:29.027 --> 00:17:30.290
MATT: It was delicious is what it was.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.486
TRAVIS: It was really good.

00:17:31.486 --> 00:17:32.807
LAURA: Let's go talk to Nostoc.

00:17:32.807 --> 00:17:33.640
SAM: Let's follow him, let's follow him.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.349
TALIESIN: Okay, this is what's important.

00:17:35.349 --> 00:17:37.231
MATT: All right, so as you head back
to the ramp that heads up

00:17:37.231 --> 00:17:41.572
from the mine enclosure itself
to the top of the realm,

00:17:41.572 --> 00:17:45.843
which is where the Greyspine
Industries mining facility is,

00:17:45.843 --> 00:17:47.125
you are brought into the building again,

00:17:47.125 --> 00:17:49.047
brought back to Nostoc's office,

00:17:49.047 --> 00:17:49.880
in which he's not sitting,

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.075
he's kind of pacing behind his desk,

00:17:52.075 --> 00:17:53.413
waiting for you as you approach.

00:17:53.413 --> 00:17:55.191
As you enter the room, he
stops pacing, turns around,

00:17:55.191 --> 00:17:57.351
puts his hand on the desk, and says,

00:17:57.351 --> 00:18:00.073
Please, enter and close
the doors behind you.

00:18:00.073 --> 00:18:01.971
(loud thud)

00:18:01.971 --> 00:18:03.861
ORION: Sorry, I didn't mean to
slam the door like that.

00:18:03.861 --> 00:18:06.838
(group laughs)

00:18:06.838 --> 00:18:08.307
MATT: "A flatulent dragonborn, eh?"

00:18:08.307 --> 00:18:09.716
(group laughs)

00:18:09.716 --> 00:18:10.549
MATT: "All right."

00:18:13.518 --> 00:18:16.873
So as you close the -
(laughs)

00:18:16.873 --> 00:18:18.472
Tiberius.

00:18:18.472 --> 00:18:20.464
(Orion clears throat comically)

00:18:20.464 --> 00:18:22.414
SAM: Sir Greyspine.

00:18:22.414 --> 00:18:23.597
Lord Greyspine?

00:18:23.597 --> 00:18:24.430
Mr. Greyspine?

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:25.793
MATT: "Lord Greyspine is fine."

00:18:25.793 --> 00:18:26.800
SAM: Lord Greyspine, yes.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.885
Why have you summoned us here?

00:18:27.885 --> 00:18:30.807
Is it to tell us information
about what just came out

00:18:30.807 --> 00:18:32.297
of your mine, I hope.

00:18:32.297 --> 00:18:33.868
MATT: "Well let's be clear."

00:18:33.868 --> 00:18:36.399
"We dwarves don't need help from outsiders.

00:18:36.399 --> 00:18:37.858
"We can handle our own business just fine."

00:18:37.858 --> 00:18:38.691
LAURA: Of course.

00:18:40.068 --> 00:18:41.893
MARISHA: Speaking of outsiders, you wouldn't happen

00:18:41.893 --> 00:18:44.726
to have seen a Lady Kima, would you?

00:18:44.726 --> 00:18:47.698
MATT: "As what the discussion
was based on previously,

00:18:47.698 --> 00:18:49.137
"you're searching for
her, and last we saw her,

00:18:49.137 --> 00:18:49.970
She went down into the mine."

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.163
LAURA: We already talked about that, Keyleth.

00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:52.286
TRAVIS: Yep, we did.

00:18:52.286 --> 00:18:54.681
LIAM: They don't like her,
she was a troublemaker

00:18:54.681 --> 00:18:56.318
and she went in.

00:18:56.318 --> 00:18:57.436
TRAVIS: You're an eagle.

00:18:57.436 --> 00:18:59.318
LAURA: She's in the mine.

00:18:59.318 --> 00:19:00.703
We'll go in and find her.

00:19:00.703 --> 00:19:01.536
Right?

00:19:01.536 --> 00:19:02.901
Lord Greyspine?

00:19:02.901 --> 00:19:03.734
MATT: "You're welcome to.

00:19:03.734 --> 00:19:05.054
"As far as I know, she's
down there somewhere.

00:19:05.054 --> 00:19:06.404
"Hopefully still in one piece."

00:19:06.404 --> 00:19:07.780
LAURA: While we're there, would
you like us to take care

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.547
of any other problems?

00:19:09.547 --> 00:19:11.276
MATT: "Getting to that.

00:19:11.276 --> 00:19:14.132
"You see these small
intrusions have been bad

00:19:14.132 --> 00:19:16.808
"for meeting our quotas with the
Bronzegrip metal warehouse

00:19:16.808 --> 00:19:19.138
"and export shipments.

00:19:19.138 --> 00:19:20.639
"Employees have been forced to

00:19:20.639 --> 00:19:23.598
"collapse a non-negotiable
portion of our tunnels

00:19:23.598 --> 00:19:25.624
"to prevent incursions like this.

00:19:25.624 --> 00:19:27.674
"Without my approval.

00:19:27.674 --> 00:19:31.236
"And this is a pattern
I wish to stop at once.

00:19:31.236 --> 00:19:34.153
"Thus, I have a proposition for you.

00:19:37.025 --> 00:19:40.241
"Now, I will give you
free reign to our mines.

00:19:40.241 --> 00:19:42.571
"I shall get the proper approvals
to make sure no Carvers

00:19:42.571 --> 00:19:46.488
"bother you as you wander
the city's lower ring.

00:19:47.351 --> 00:19:49.565
"And I will contract you
to delve past our tunnels

00:19:49.565 --> 00:19:52.959
"and investigate the
source of these creatures,

00:19:52.959 --> 00:19:55.903
"where they come from, where they live,

00:19:55.903 --> 00:19:57.692
"and if there is some sort of a leader

00:19:57.692 --> 00:20:00.944
"who gives them their commands.

00:20:00.944 --> 00:20:02.194
"Eliminate them.

00:20:03.196 --> 00:20:07.262
"For this, I will reward
you with not a trifle sum.

00:20:07.262 --> 00:20:08.845
"25,000 gold pieces.

00:20:09.748 --> 00:20:13.546
"Plus 250 gold per beast scalp
you provide upon returning."

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:15.269
LAURA: Ooh, I like this.

00:20:15.269 --> 00:20:17.793
ORION: Grog, this seems like a
wonderful job, doesn't it?

00:20:17.793 --> 00:20:19.518
SAM: Money is wonderful.

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:20.577
We like money.

00:20:22.394 --> 00:20:25.356
But we've been charged to find Lady Kima.

00:20:25.356 --> 00:20:28.208
We need assurances that we will find her

00:20:28.208 --> 00:20:30.514
or at least some evidence
of her in the mines.

00:20:30.514 --> 00:20:32.419
MATT: "The brazen halfling bitch went in there

00:20:32.419 --> 00:20:34.208
"without my approval and
wandered into the mines,

00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:35.658
"not to be seen.

00:20:36.491 --> 00:20:38.932
"So if she is down there,
I hope she's in one piece.

00:20:38.932 --> 00:20:40.692
"I can't guarantee it.

00:20:40.692 --> 00:20:42.851
"But if there's any place to
find her, that's probably it."

00:20:42.851 --> 00:20:45.119
LIAM: We're the group of adventurers for you.

00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:46.431
I don't know if you've heard

00:20:46.431 --> 00:20:49.085
of the heroes Emon, who just recently-

00:20:49.085 --> 00:20:50.673
I'm sure you've heard something.

00:20:50.673 --> 00:20:52.318
Word travels fast.

00:20:52.318 --> 00:20:53.553
MATT: "Not beneath this mountain, it doesn't,

00:20:53.553 --> 00:20:55.046
of human closers."

00:20:55.046 --> 00:20:58.386
LIAM: We've just done a lot of
good to the ruler of Emon.

00:20:58.386 --> 00:20:59.219
MATT: "Great.

00:20:59.219 --> 00:21:00.960
How does that help us dwarves?"

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.367
ORION: We're saying we
are going to help you, too.

00:21:04.261 --> 00:21:06.274
And everything will be fine,
and we'll all be happy.

00:21:06.274 --> 00:21:09.403
LAURA: Well, we've discovered, in
our past adventures, however,

00:21:09.403 --> 00:21:10.986
is that every realm

00:21:13.362 --> 00:21:16.441
seems to be having trouble with
the same sort of creatures,

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:19.382
coming up from the Underdark perhaps?

00:21:19.382 --> 00:21:21.578
LIAM: All we're saying is,
help us help you.

00:21:21.578 --> 00:21:24.387
What exactly have
you seen before this day?

00:21:24.387 --> 00:21:26.218
More of the same? Or other creatures?

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:28.021
MATT: He sits back for a second.

00:21:28.031 --> 00:21:30.256
"The types of creatures, I do not know.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.832
"I mostly deal with the business

00:21:32.832 --> 00:21:35.102
"and just know that there's
some bullshite going on

00:21:35.102 --> 00:21:36.988
"down in the mines.

00:21:36.988 --> 00:21:39.063
"You could ask our foreman, Hieris.

00:21:39.063 --> 00:21:40.536
"He's dealt with the cleanup each time

00:21:40.536 --> 00:21:41.829
"we've had an incursion like this,

"so if anyone has information
on what these creatures are,

"he'd be the one to talk to."

00:21:47.163 --> 00:21:48.439
LIAM: Sorry, what was his name again?

00:21:48.439 --> 00:21:49.662
MATT, SAM, LAURA: Hieris.

00:21:50.278 --> 00:21:51.945
MATT: "He's a foreman at the mine proper."

00:21:51.945 --> 00:21:52.778
LAURA: All right.

00:21:52.778 --> 00:21:56.377
TALIESIN: I think this seems like the
sort of job we'd want to take.

00:21:56.377 --> 00:21:57.450
LAURA, ORION: Yes.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.059
TRAVIS: Will we get paid for the
monsters and creatures

00:22:00.059 --> 00:22:01.991
we've already slayed?

00:22:01.991 --> 00:22:05.026
MATT: "This deal was not sewn in yet, so no."

00:22:05.026 --> 00:22:05.859
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:22:05.859 --> 00:22:07.528
MATT: "But we thank you for your aid."

00:22:07.528 --> 00:22:10.645
PERCY: It is customary in our
culture to seal a deal

00:22:10.645 --> 00:22:12.432
with a drink.

00:22:12.432 --> 00:22:14.430
TALIESIN: As I think you are all aware.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.212
LAURA: Truly, truly.

00:22:16.212 --> 00:22:18.652
LIAM: See, I wasn't just fucking
with you last week.

00:22:18.652 --> 00:22:19.967
(group laughs)

00:22:19.967 --> 00:22:21.242
That's a thing we do.

00:22:21.741 --> 00:22:24.046
TALIESIN: And since we are about to risk our lives...

00:22:24.046 --> 00:22:25.677
TRAVIS: I forgot you did that.

00:22:25.677 --> 00:22:27.070
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.703
TALIESIN: Yes! Happily.

00:22:29.092 --> 00:22:31.099
TRAVIS: Roll good, it's the first one.

00:22:34.749 --> 00:22:35.742
LIAM: Come on, Percy!

00:22:35.742 --> 00:22:36.575
TALIESIN: 14.

00:22:36.575 --> 00:22:37.408
LAURA: Oh.

00:22:37.408 --> 00:22:38.241
SAM: It's pretty good.

00:22:38.241 --> 00:22:39.241
Not great.

00:22:40.164 --> 00:22:43.854
MATT: You can see this long,
distant, angry, dwarven,

00:22:43.854 --> 00:22:45.354
mistrusting stare.

00:22:46.338 --> 00:22:51.013
Rubs his chin, his well-kept,
blackened beard and goes,

00:22:51.013 --> 00:22:53.751
"Huh, but a sip, as it was a gift."

00:22:53.751 --> 00:22:54.584
LAURA: Yes!

00:22:57.091 --> 00:22:58.191
SAM: (laughs) We'll take it.

00:22:58.191 --> 00:23:01.176
He pulls the ale barrel
which you guys provided,

00:23:01.176 --> 00:23:04.176
sets it on the side of his
desk with the same spigot

00:23:04.176 --> 00:23:06.241
that you had placed in when
you presented it earlier

00:23:06.241 --> 00:23:07.691
and says, "Take a bit."

00:23:08.531 --> 00:23:10.153
"A bit."

00:23:10.153 --> 00:23:12.218
LAURA: (whispering) Put some in a bottle.

00:23:12.456 --> 00:23:14.310
ORION: We have to save some for those guards.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.451
LIAM: Let me take care of it.

00:23:15.451 --> 00:23:16.481
I'll pour everyone a glass.

00:23:16.481 --> 00:23:17.990
LIAM: Oh, thank you, brother.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.924
I take my empty water flask
that I emptied out before,

00:23:22.924 --> 00:23:26.453
and am smiling and pouring glasses

00:23:26.453 --> 00:23:29.754
and also squirting a little
bit here and there as I want.

00:23:29.754 --> 00:23:32.012
I start to just play a
little ditty on the flute.

00:23:32.012 --> 00:23:34.590
I thought we could accompany
our sip with a little bit

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.317
of music, not to distract you, just to--

00:23:37.317 --> 00:23:39.052
(group laughs)

00:23:39.052 --> 00:23:41.481
just to sort of accompany us.

00:23:41.481 --> 00:23:44.203
MATT: His nose squints at the sound.

00:23:44.203 --> 00:23:47.037
(SAM imitates a jaunty flute)

00:23:47.037 --> 00:23:50.150
MATT: "Gnomish tunes aren't
to my ears and liking."

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.209
However, you do get an inspiration dice.

00:23:51.209 --> 00:23:52.042
LAURA: Yay.

00:23:53.296 --> 00:23:56.667
MATT: All right, so go ahead and
make a - (laughs)

00:23:56.667 --> 00:23:58.534
Make a sleight of hand check on this.

00:23:58.534 --> 00:23:59.940
LIAM: Okay.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:00.773
That's what we do, right?

00:24:00.773 --> 00:24:01.606
LAURA: Roll well.

00:24:02.439 --> 00:24:03.944
Here we go.

00:24:03.944 --> 00:24:05.177
LAURA AND LIAM: Oh, no.

00:24:05.177 --> 00:24:06.837
SAM: You have inspiration dice.

00:24:06.837 --> 00:24:08.518
TALIESIN: Inspiration dice are d8?

00:24:08.518 --> 00:24:10.410
MATT: Yep, you add a d8 to it as well.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:12.241
LIAM: Okay, and I can add a d8 to this?

00:24:12.241 --> 00:24:12.956
MATT: Correct.

00:24:12.956 --> 00:24:15.181
TALIESIN: The ale is that good.

00:24:15.181 --> 00:24:16.014
LIAM: Oh good.

00:24:16.014 --> 00:24:16.960
Now I'm at 19.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.793
(Travis groans in relief)

00:24:17.793 --> 00:24:18.707
Hey.

00:24:18.707 --> 00:24:20.071
MATT: As he's listening to the gnomish music

00:24:20.071 --> 00:24:21.704
and kind of pushing it
away with his hands, like,

00:24:21.704 --> 00:24:23.911
"Stop, I don't- no.

00:24:24.567 --> 00:24:26.217
"I appreciate it, but I don't."

00:24:26.217 --> 00:24:28.510
SAM: All right, there's not accounting for taste.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.596
MATT: As you do that, your
wineskin goes to full.

00:24:31.596 --> 00:24:32.429
(imitates liquid sloshing)

00:24:32.429 --> 00:24:34.326
Swollen to its brim.

00:24:34.479 --> 00:24:35.898
You switch over to one of the cups,

00:24:35.898 --> 00:24:37.032
you pass around the drinks.

00:24:37.032 --> 00:24:40.282
All of you manage to get
your drinks passed around.

00:24:40.282 --> 00:24:41.115
LAURA: Huzzah!

00:24:41.115 --> 00:24:42.173
MATT: "To a contract!"

00:24:42.173 --> 00:24:43.166
TRAVIS: Aye! Huzzah!

00:24:43.166 --> 00:24:44.329
TALIESIN: To a contract.

00:24:44.329 --> 00:24:45.255
MARISHA: Contracts.

00:24:45.255 --> 00:24:46.498
SAM: L'chaim!

00:24:46.961 --> 00:24:48.436
MARISHA: Love contracts.

00:24:48.436 --> 00:24:49.560
LIAM: Is that Draconian?

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.744
SAM: It's Gnomish.

00:24:50.744 --> 00:24:52.628
TALIESIN: To risking our lives. For money.

00:24:52.628 --> 00:24:54.399
LAURA: How old is Nostoc?

00:24:54.399 --> 00:24:55.562
Just out of curiosity.

00:24:56.018 --> 00:24:57.461
MATT: It's hard to tell.

00:24:57.461 --> 00:24:59.197
Dwarves live quite a long time.

00:24:59.197 --> 00:25:00.761
He would be equivalent
to like a human forties.

00:25:00.761 --> 00:25:03.384
Dwarven time, somewhere
in his mid-hundreds.

00:25:03.384 --> 00:25:05.447
MARISHA: Smells like its been in the
barrel for a hundred years.

00:25:05.447 --> 00:25:06.840
ORION: It has been.

00:25:07.336 --> 00:25:08.799
LAURA: This is excellent.

00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:10.404
LIAM: Tastes like two buck Chuck.

00:25:10.404 --> 00:25:11.724
(group laughs)

00:25:11.724 --> 00:25:14.449
ORION: Oh, I know him from Quimdendale.

00:25:14.449 --> 00:25:18.532
TRAVIS: What do you know of a
Ballsac up in the tavern?

00:25:19.872 --> 00:25:21.483
MATT: "I'm sorry, what?"

00:25:21.483 --> 00:25:22.544
TRAVIS: Do I have that right?

00:25:22.544 --> 00:25:23.645
LAURA: Ball, ball -

00:25:23.645 --> 00:25:24.478
MARISHA: Balgus.

00:25:24.478 --> 00:25:25.356
GROUP: Balgus.

00:25:25.356 --> 00:25:28.177
MATT: "Ah, Balgus, that's the brand
of what you brought me."

00:25:28.177 --> 00:25:31.008
SAM: You know what, I think we
asked about him last time.

00:25:31.008 --> 00:25:32.117
LAURA: I think we did.

00:25:32.117 --> 00:25:33.910
ORION: Also, may we take a short rest

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.628
before we leave this facility?

00:25:35.628 --> 00:25:37.541
MARISHA: Yes, could we do that?

00:25:37.987 --> 00:25:39.670
Is this considered a short rest?

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:41.628
LAURA: Oh yeah, that actually would be good.

00:25:41.628 --> 00:25:43.357
MATT: If you'd like to do that,

00:25:43.357 --> 00:25:45.244
that would just be taking
a short rest outside,

00:25:45.244 --> 00:25:46.638
probably not in the office proper.

00:25:46.638 --> 00:25:48.000
LAURA: Understandable.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.961
MATT: You can leave and just sit down

00:25:49.961 --> 00:25:51.274
and get some rest.

00:25:51.274 --> 00:25:53.501
LAURA: When we take a rest, can
I look for Hieris?

00:25:53.501 --> 00:25:54.334
MATT: You can as well.

00:25:54.334 --> 00:25:55.989
So, while you guys are
taking a short rest,

00:25:55.989 --> 00:25:57.545
you're able to use any of your hit dice

00:25:57.545 --> 00:25:58.656
to heal up naturally.

00:25:58.656 --> 00:26:00.565
TRAVIS: We don't naturally heal up?

00:26:00.565 --> 00:26:02.242
MATT: That is your natural healing.

00:26:03.311 --> 00:26:04.805
Not to full.

00:26:04.805 --> 00:26:06.172
It's a continuation, Grog.

00:26:06.172 --> 00:26:08.338
SAM: I will sing a song of rest.

00:26:08.338 --> 00:26:10.932
And it goes a little something like,

00:26:10.932 --> 00:26:13.895
♫ Scanlan make you feel good ♫

00:26:13.895 --> 00:26:17.456
♫ Scanlan make you feel real good ♫

00:26:17.456 --> 00:26:19.023
ORION: Oh, I feel so good.

00:26:19.023 --> 00:26:21.513
SAM: No wait, you get an extra d6
on all your heals.

00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:23.912
TRAVIS: I appreciate the slow jam.

00:26:23.912 --> 00:26:26.619
MATT: Yeah, on every hit dice,
you get an extra d6.

00:26:28.169 --> 00:26:29.737
TRAVIS: R. Kelly would agree.

00:26:29.737 --> 00:26:31.898
(Matt laughs)

00:26:35.097 --> 00:26:37.189
LAURA: I didn't take any hit points.

00:26:37.189 --> 00:26:38.766
I'm at full health.

00:26:38.766 --> 00:26:41.915
MATT: So you got a slow jam just
for the sake of the slow jam.

00:26:41.915 --> 00:26:43.723
LAURA: That's right.
And it was great.

00:26:43.723 --> 00:26:46.084
MATT: All right, roll an investigate check.

00:26:46.084 --> 00:26:47.825
ORION: It feels good.
Real good.

00:26:47.825 --> 00:26:48.662
LAURA: Okay.

00:26:48.662 --> 00:26:50.275
Oh, 25.

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:52.434
MATT: A brief discussion with a few

00:26:52.434 --> 00:26:54.675
of the other wandering
dwarf miners that are

00:26:54.675 --> 00:26:57.405
in the outskirts of the
buildings' facilities.

00:26:57.405 --> 00:26:59.477
Eventually it leads you
over to what is a small,

00:26:59.477 --> 00:27:03.148
secondary building
maybe 200 yards off

00:27:03.148 --> 00:27:04.915
from the main property.

00:27:04.915 --> 00:27:07.175
That apparently is where Hieris resides

00:27:07.175 --> 00:27:10.296
and keeps watch over the
entire establishment.

00:27:10.296 --> 00:27:11.510
LIAM: I've tagged along.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:12.883
LAURA: Knock knock knock.

00:27:12.883 --> 00:27:15.497
MATT: All right, the rest of you going with her?

00:27:15.497 --> 00:27:17.027
SAM: Yeah, we'll go with her.

00:27:17.027 --> 00:27:19.635
MATT: Why not! Why split the party?

00:27:19.635 --> 00:27:21.793
So the the group makes their way over

00:27:21.793 --> 00:27:24.085
to the outskirts of the building.

00:27:24.085 --> 00:27:26.927
Opens up and a very nice, 
portly looking dwarf

00:27:26.927 --> 00:27:30.092
with a big tuft of a chinstrap beard.

00:27:30.554 --> 00:27:32.636
Big reddish, ruddy nose.

00:27:32.636 --> 00:27:33.999
Leather apron on.

00:27:33.999 --> 00:27:35.801
And he opens the door.

00:27:35.801 --> 00:27:36.971
"Aye, hello!

00:27:36.971 --> 00:27:37.807
Nice to meet you.

00:27:37.807 --> 00:27:39.043
What can I do for ye?"

00:27:39.043 --> 00:27:40.466
LAURA: Hi. You must be Hieris?

00:27:40.466 --> 00:27:41.450
MATT: "I am, I am.

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:42.914
Foreman of this here fine mine."

00:27:42.914 --> 00:27:44.325
LAURA: Wonderful to meet you.

00:27:44.325 --> 00:27:46.188
I've heard wonderful things about you.

00:27:46.188 --> 00:27:47.981
MATT: "Oh, have you! From who?"

00:27:47.981 --> 00:27:50.294
LAURA: Uh, from Lord Greyspine himself.

00:27:50.294 --> 00:27:52.157
MATT: "Really? Oh. All right.

00:27:52.157 --> 00:27:54.689
"Well, how can I be of service?"

00:27:54.689 --> 00:27:56.833
LAURA: We were curious.

00:27:56.833 --> 00:27:59.476
I'm sure you witnessed all
of those wonderful goblins

00:27:59.476 --> 00:28:02.056
and trolls and other nonsense
coming out of the mine.

00:28:02.056 --> 00:28:04.014
MATT: "Aye. Nasty lot. 
It always makes my weeks

00:28:04.014 --> 00:28:05.553
"that much more interesting."

00:28:05.553 --> 00:28:08.046
LAURA: Weeks? So this has been
happening for quite a while?

00:28:08.046 --> 00:28:09.932
MATT: "Unfortunately, at least five or six."

00:28:09.932 --> 00:28:12.883
LAURA: And what kind of monsters
have you been dealing with?

00:28:12.883 --> 00:28:14.333
MATT: "Terrible kinds."

00:28:14.333 --> 00:28:16.718
He starts rubbing his
chin for a little and goes,

00:28:16.718 --> 00:28:19.148
"We generally deal with
the occasional goblin den

00:28:19.148 --> 00:28:21.411
"we stumble across when
opening new tunnels.

00:28:21.411 --> 00:28:23.340
"That's part of the norm.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.749
"Other nasty underground beasties.

00:28:25.749 --> 00:28:27.754
"However, over this past few weeks,

00:28:27.754 --> 00:28:30.120
"we've seen some real
nightmarish things slither

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.693
"out of the shadows.

00:28:31.693 --> 00:28:34.755
"Many goblins stitched together,

00:28:34.755 --> 00:28:37.124
"like some kind of ball
of screaming green lint.

00:28:37.124 --> 00:28:37.957
SAM: Ooh, god.

00:28:37.957 --> 00:28:39.809
MATT: "Slimes and oozes that would mutate

00:28:39.809 --> 00:28:42.338
"and change color rapidly
before seeming to dissolve

00:28:42.338 --> 00:28:43.282
"on their own.

00:28:43.282 --> 00:28:45.701
"Unstable-looking really, in their form."

00:28:45.701 --> 00:28:47.533
SAM: Like a goblin centipede?

00:28:47.533 --> 00:28:48.836
(Laura, Liam, Travis laugh)

00:28:48.836 --> 00:28:50.352
MATT: "If you will, aye aye."

00:28:50.352 --> 00:28:53.108
ORION: Sounds more like some
type of necromancy magic.

00:28:53.108 --> 00:28:55.441
MATT: "Perhaps, but they're not undead, per se.

00:28:55.441 --> 00:28:56.680
"They're still alive.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.803
"At least from what we can tell.

00:28:58.803 --> 00:29:01.475
"Whatever agony face them
in their physical form.

00:29:01.475 --> 00:29:02.943
ORION: Oh, that's even worse.

00:29:02.943 --> 00:29:05.481
MATT: "We even had one brief
run-in with what looked

00:29:05.481 --> 00:29:07.937
"like a duergar that had
swollen and sprouted eyes

00:29:07.937 --> 00:29:09.703
"and mouths all across his body.
That was a sight."

00:29:09.703 --> 00:29:10.951
SAM: What's a duergar?

00:29:10.951 --> 00:29:12.206
LIAM: That's a dark dwarf.

00:29:12.206 --> 00:29:13.415
They're little fuckers, those are.

00:29:13.415 --> 00:29:14.896
MATT: "Aye, duergar."

00:29:14.896 --> 00:29:15.904
And he spits to the side.

00:29:15.904 --> 00:29:17.799
"Filthy lost souls.

00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:19.913
"Dwarves of old that
turned to a darker god.

00:29:19.913 --> 00:29:22.532
"Thankfully, they live far
beneath the mountains,

00:29:22.532 --> 00:29:25.158
"and usually far north
enough to not worry about it.

00:29:25.158 --> 00:29:27.725
"But one of them found its way up here,

00:29:27.725 --> 00:29:30.807
"in this strange, awful, maw-covered form.

00:29:30.807 --> 00:29:32.380
"It was terrifying.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.762
"And the smell!

00:29:33.762 --> 00:29:34.595
"Oh ho ho!

00:29:36.131 --> 00:29:39.411
"Anyway, we've even seen a
few creatures from the surface

00:29:39.411 --> 00:29:41.649
"that normally aren't
found down here as well,

00:29:41.649 --> 00:29:42.687
"which is strange.

00:29:42.687 --> 00:29:44.396
"They don't wander down.

00:29:44.396 --> 00:29:45.997
"Something's bringing them.

00:29:45.997 --> 00:29:47.040
"Weirdest thing."

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.282
"Oh! And I just heard we
had some weird,

00:29:49.282 --> 00:29:51.996
many-headed serpent thing that
just got killed down there.

00:29:51.996 --> 00:29:53.642
LAURA: Oh, we just killed one of those.

00:29:53.642 --> 00:29:55.143
MATT: "That was you!"

00:29:55.143 --> 00:29:55.976
LAURA: Yes!

00:29:55.976 --> 00:29:57.711
TRAVIS: Our hero is right over here.

00:29:57.711 --> 00:29:58.962
SAM: (clears throat) Hi.

00:29:58.962 --> 00:30:01.148
(group laughs)

00:30:01.148 --> 00:30:03.431
MATT: And he steps onto his back
leg, shifting his weight,

00:30:03.431 --> 00:30:05.263
and cocks an awkward eyebrow.

00:30:05.263 --> 00:30:06.787
"Really?"

00:30:06.787 --> 00:30:09.370
SAM: I'm really strong for my age.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:10.898
ORION: We were all surprised.

00:30:10.898 --> 00:30:13.063
TALIESIN: We're as surprised as anybody.

00:30:13.063 --> 00:30:14.450
TRAVIS: Fearsome Scanlan.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:16.945
SAM: Actually, Hieris,
I have a question for you.

00:30:16.945 --> 00:30:18.638
You know the mines very well, yes?

00:30:18.638 --> 00:30:19.596
MATT: "Aye, I do."

00:30:22.423 --> 00:30:24.833
SAM: Far from asking you to draw us a map,

00:30:24.833 --> 00:30:29.183
are there any tunnels or
directions that we should avoid

00:30:29.183 --> 00:30:31.362
or particularly head towards?

00:30:31.362 --> 00:30:33.766
Anything that we should look for in terms

00:30:33.766 --> 00:30:36.082
of traps or tricks?

00:30:36.082 --> 00:30:37.503
MATT: "Not within our mines.

00:30:37.503 --> 00:30:39.676
"They're usually well-guarded.
Or, they were."

00:30:39.676 --> 00:30:41.970
ORION: Also, do you have a map?

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:43.033
MATT: "Of the mines?

00:30:43.033 --> 00:30:43.866
"Yeah, I do."

00:30:43.866 --> 00:30:44.699
ORION: Wonderful.

00:30:44.699 --> 00:30:47.152
MATT: He starts going through his notes here.

00:30:47.152 --> 00:30:48.394
ORION: I'll take that.

00:30:48.394 --> 00:30:50.300
SAM: That's where we're going, right?

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.141
TRAVIS: We're goin' in the hole.

00:30:52.141 --> 00:30:54.620
MATT: It's kinda haphazardly
scrawled across a piece

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.910
of parchment, but he hands it over to you.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:00.727
MATT: And he says, "So that's the
front part of the mines.

00:31:01.923 --> 00:31:06.481
"Unfortunately, half of our
tunnels have been

00:31:06.481 --> 00:31:09.443
"relinquished to close off
some of these beasties

00:31:09.443 --> 00:31:11.760
"coming through, so we're
gonna have to recarve portions

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.495
"of the mine as we progress forward.

00:31:13.495 --> 00:31:16.060
"Kind of starting at
square one best we can.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.474
"But that at least is what
we're currently working with.

00:31:19.474 --> 00:31:21.451
"There is a subterranean level as well.

00:31:21.451 --> 00:31:23.701
"We have an elevator inside

00:31:23.701 --> 00:31:27.462
"that brings the various
mine carts to and from."

00:31:27.462 --> 00:31:30.322
LAURA: Is there a particular area on that map

00:31:30.322 --> 00:31:33.705
that most of the baddies
seem to be coming from?

00:31:33.705 --> 00:31:35.099
MATT: "No, we've closed it off each time."

00:31:35.099 --> 00:31:36.633
LAURA: Just kind of everywhere?

00:31:36.633 --> 00:31:38.376
MATT: "Oh no, we've had a few
tunnels they've come through,

00:31:38.376 --> 00:31:40.023
"but we've managed to collapse those

00:31:40.023 --> 00:31:41.975
"and make sure they're
not coming through again.

00:31:41.975 --> 00:31:45.922
LIAM: And we noticed the, I believed
it was the naga we fought,

00:31:45.922 --> 00:31:49.930
it seemed to have several
extra heads stitched on.

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.032
Have you no knowledge of these creatures?

00:31:52.032 --> 00:31:54.092
It seems very odd.

00:31:54.092 --> 00:31:57.364
Is there any connection in
dwarven history or past?

00:31:57.364 --> 00:31:58.885
Or this is totally out of the blue?

00:31:58.885 --> 00:32:00.611
MATT: "No no, not to my knowledge, at least.

00:32:00.611 --> 00:32:03.056
"I mean, most beasts we
find are in one piece,

00:32:03.056 --> 00:32:04.806
"not several together.

00:32:05.272 --> 00:32:07.134
"It's a bit disturbing to be honest.

00:32:07.134 --> 00:32:09.824
"I told my nephew about it
and he was crying for hours."

00:32:09.824 --> 00:32:11.077
LAURA and MARISHA: Oh.

00:32:11.077 --> 00:32:11.880
ORION: (laughs)

00:32:12.323 --> 00:32:13.785
TRAVIS: Do any of the beasts go back into them?

00:32:13.785 --> 00:32:16.249
MATT: "Oh no, we've killed them
as they come out each time."

00:32:16.249 --> 00:32:18.763
Right, they don't take anything back.

00:32:18.763 --> 00:32:20.506
MATT: "Not from what I've seen, no."

00:32:20.506 --> 00:32:24.457
MARISHA: Hieris, do you know if
there's any other entrances

00:32:24.457 --> 00:32:26.218
into the mine?

00:32:26.218 --> 00:32:28.556
Any old secret tunnels,
something that someone

00:32:28.556 --> 00:32:29.779
could be using to get in?

00:32:29.779 --> 00:32:31.914
MATT: "Not to the mine, this is
all proprietary.

00:32:31.914 --> 00:32:35.076
"This is the business we run,
so we don't have any internal

00:32:35.076 --> 00:32:36.390
"or secret entrances.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.792
"That would leave us open
to a sort of a thief

00:32:38.792 --> 00:32:40.554
to come in and steal our mithril."

00:32:40.907 --> 00:32:42.762
LIAM: And what's security like on the mine?

00:32:42.762 --> 00:32:44.479
Is there any chance
someone could've slipped in

00:32:44.479 --> 00:32:46.965
through Kraghammer without you knowing,

00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:47.909
or is that all locked up?

00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:48.876
MATT: "Oh, I highly doubt that, not with

00:32:48.876 --> 00:32:49.876
"the way our carvers are trained."

00:32:49.876 --> 00:32:51.313
LIAM: Understood, understood.

00:32:51.313 --> 00:32:52.423
LAURA: They are quite--

00:32:52.423 --> 00:32:54.121
MATT: "That's what I'm talking about.

00:32:54.121 --> 00:32:54.954
LAURA: Yeah.

00:32:54.954 --> 00:32:56.704
MATT: "Fine dwarven study."

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:58.804
TRAVIS: Before we go--

00:32:58.804 --> 00:32:59.904
LAURA: Strong ale.

00:32:59.904 --> 00:33:01.895
MATT: "Finest of military classes, aye.

00:33:01.895 --> 00:33:02.818
"Proud of 'em."

00:33:02.818 --> 00:33:03.911
TRAVIS: What do you use for the--

00:33:03.911 --> 00:33:05.612
MATT: "I had a cousin who was once a carver.

00:33:05.612 --> 00:33:06.445
"Raised him there.

00:33:06.445 --> 00:33:08.295
"His whole family brought
him up on that side.

00:33:08.295 --> 00:33:10.225
"Military weapon training every day.

00:33:10.225 --> 00:33:12.114
"Couldn't come out and
play with the rest of us.

00:33:12.114 --> 00:33:13.092
"I felt bad for him.

00:33:13.092 --> 00:33:15.367
"But he grew up to be a
right nasty dwarf, aye."

00:33:15.367 --> 00:33:17.025
LIAM: You say had.

00:33:17.025 --> 00:33:18.494
LAURA: Where is he now?

00:33:18.494 --> 00:33:21.891
MATT: "Unfortunately, he was slain
in one of the incursions.

00:33:22.988 --> 00:33:25.526
"That duergar I was telling you about.

00:33:25.526 --> 00:33:28.076
"But, such is the nature
of the fighter, I suppose."

00:33:28.076 --> 00:33:29.542
LAURA: A damn shame.

00:33:29.542 --> 00:33:30.375
I'm so sorry.

00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:31.683
MATT: "I appreciate that.

00:33:31.683 --> 00:33:34.079
"To be honest, he was kind
of a bastard, but um--

00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:35.355
"don't miss him too much.

00:33:35.355 --> 00:33:36.491
"But I appreciate the thought.

00:33:36.491 --> 00:33:37.614
"That's very kind of you."

00:33:37.614 --> 00:33:38.927
SAM: We won't avenge him then.

00:33:38.927 --> 00:33:40.345
MATT: "I mean, still avenge him."

00:33:40.345 --> 00:33:41.485
LIAM: Literally or figuratively?

00:33:41.485 --> 00:33:42.306
MATT: "I'm not sure.

00:33:42.306 --> 00:33:43.139
TRAVIS: He had parents.

00:33:43.139 --> 00:33:44.588
MATT: "He had parents.

00:33:44.588 --> 00:33:46.044
"We were related somewhat.

00:33:46.044 --> 00:33:46.877
"I'm not gonna say too closely."

00:33:46.877 --> 00:33:47.710
LAURA: Can I ask a question?

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:48.543
MATT: "Ah, yes."

00:33:48.543 --> 00:33:50.863
LAURA: Not to you, to the other guy, Matt.

00:33:50.863 --> 00:33:52.193
MATT: Ah, yes.

00:33:52.193 --> 00:33:53.737
(group laughs)

00:33:53.737 --> 00:33:54.900
MATT: Yes, Laura?

00:33:55.545 --> 00:33:58.235
LAURA: When we take a rest, do
we get our spells back

00:33:58.235 --> 00:33:59.331
for the day?

00:33:59.331 --> 00:34:00.164
MATT: Not a short rest.

00:34:00.164 --> 00:34:01.105
It has to be a long rest.

00:34:01.105 --> 00:34:02.208
LAURA: All right, cool.

00:34:02.208 --> 00:34:04.449
TALIESIN: Which is why we're
gonna take a proper nap.

00:34:04.449 --> 00:34:06.553
LAURA: We're gonna take a real nap?

00:34:06.553 --> 00:34:09.089
TALIESIN: I think we should go buy
some potions and take a nap.

00:34:09.089 --> 00:34:10.090
LIAM: I think so.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.312
LAURA: All right, this could be really bad.

00:34:12.312 --> 00:34:14.256
I mean, we're about to put the dungeons

00:34:14.256 --> 00:34:15.739
in Dungeons and Dragons.

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:17.877
TRAVIS: Let's go get drunk and go to sleep then.

00:34:17.877 --> 00:34:19.447
LAURA: All right.

00:34:19.447 --> 00:34:20.520
MATT: There you go.

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.324
TALIESIN: And stock up on some potions.

00:34:22.324 --> 00:34:23.449
Hieris, you've been so helpful.

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:25.083
MATT: "Of course, I'm happy to."

00:34:25.083 --> 00:34:26.578
MARISHA: One last question.

00:34:26.578 --> 00:34:27.952
MATT: "It doesn't have to be last.

00:34:27.952 --> 00:34:29.848
"You're welcome to stay as long as you like.

00:34:29.848 --> 00:34:32.299
I don't get visitors to
often up here in my booth."

00:34:32.299 --> 00:34:34.885
MARISHA: You should come drink
with us at the tavern.

00:34:34.885 --> 00:34:36.622
MATT: "Oh well, I have to stay here.

00:34:36.622 --> 00:34:38.526
"Work, at least for the next six hours."

00:34:38.526 --> 00:34:40.210
LIAM: All night, do you get
off in six more hours?

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:41.043
MATT: "Aye.

00:34:41.043 --> 00:34:42.398
"But I have some dried fruits.

00:34:42.398 --> 00:34:43.844
"I've got some meats inside.

00:34:43.844 --> 00:34:47.665
"I've got two chairs and
you could fit in my lap,"

00:34:47.665 --> 00:34:49.255
and he kind of pats you on the head.

00:34:49.255 --> 00:34:50.327
SAM: I've killed.

00:34:50.327 --> 00:34:52.469
(group laughs)

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:53.547
MATT: "Right."

00:34:53.547 --> 00:34:56.311
ORION: This one needs a whore, sorry.

00:34:56.311 --> 00:34:57.282
(Sam grunts)

00:34:57.282 --> 00:34:58.449
MATT: "Fair enough."

00:34:58.956 --> 00:35:00.919
Also, apparently my mic's a bit loud.

00:35:00.919 --> 00:35:03.127
If you can turn it down
a bit for you guys.

00:35:03.127 --> 00:35:04.731
LIAM: What's a mic?

00:35:04.731 --> 00:35:06.235
MATT: "Forget that, you heard nothing.

00:35:06.235 --> 00:35:09.331
"It's a strange echo in the
caverns of Kraghammer. Anyway--"

00:35:09.331 --> 00:35:11.460
TRAVIS: Look at the time.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:12.677
LAURA: We have to go.

00:35:12.677 --> 00:35:14.319
We'll come see you again, Hieris.

00:35:14.319 --> 00:35:15.534
MATT: "Of course, anytime.

00:35:15.534 --> 00:35:16.537
"When we're not busy.

00:35:16.537 --> 00:35:18.487
"But when I'm not busy,
you're welcome to come by."

00:35:18.487 --> 00:35:19.343
ORION: All right.

00:35:19.343 --> 00:35:20.366
MARISHA: Oh, that'd be nice.

00:35:20.366 --> 00:35:22.976
LIAM: Tell you what, when we drag
our asses out of that mine,

00:35:22.976 --> 00:35:24.719
we'll come straight to
you and buy you a drink.

00:35:24.719 --> 00:35:26.415
LAURA: And we'll have some of that dried fruit.

00:35:26.415 --> 00:35:27.574
TRAVIS: We're lying, right?

00:35:27.574 --> 00:35:29.896
MATT: "Oh, I'll save a batch for
you, you half-elf lass."

00:35:29.896 --> 00:35:30.729
LAURA: All right.

00:35:30.729 --> 00:35:32.057
LIAM: Do the wink thing you do.

00:35:32.057 --> 00:35:33.420
LAURA: I did, I already did.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:34.963
LIAM: Oh, you did it already.

00:35:34.963 --> 00:35:35.996
She's good at winking.

00:35:35.996 --> 00:35:38.009
MATT: "I saw, it was a good wink.

00:35:38.009 --> 00:35:39.930
"Aye. Made me tingle in my shoulders."

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:41.406
GROG: Just your shoulders?

00:35:41.406 --> 00:35:43.948
MATT: "That might be the diabetes, but--"

00:35:43.948 --> 00:35:45.256
(group laughs)

00:35:45.256 --> 00:35:46.691
MATT: "But mostly the wink, I think."

00:35:46.691 --> 00:35:47.524
TRAVIS: Good.

00:35:47.524 --> 00:35:50.534
MARISHA: Oh, we should get him something
other than dried fruit.

00:35:50.534 --> 00:35:51.817
That's not good for diabetes.

00:35:51.817 --> 00:35:53.091
TRAVIS: Back to the tavern.

00:35:53.091 --> 00:35:55.043
TALIESIN: At least it means he's regular.

00:35:55.043 --> 00:35:56.675
TRAVIS: Or did you have something?

00:35:56.675 --> 00:35:57.782
SAM: No, we're good.

00:35:57.782 --> 00:35:58.875
Back to the tavern.

00:35:58.875 --> 00:36:01.728
We go back to the Iron
Hearth Tavern, right?

00:36:01.728 --> 00:36:03.237
Is that what it's called?

00:36:03.237 --> 00:36:06.421
MATT: For those who are asking, that's
West Country, is the accent.

00:36:06.421 --> 00:36:07.133
LAURA: Yes.

00:36:07.133 --> 00:36:08.023
MATT: Cornwall.

00:36:08.023 --> 00:36:09.753
LAURA: What time is it?

00:36:09.753 --> 00:36:10.753
Should we buy potions now?

00:36:10.753 --> 00:36:12.267
TRAVIS: If we're underground--

00:36:12.267 --> 00:36:13.433
LAURA: Oh, is everything open?

00:36:13.433 --> 00:36:15.565
MATT: As far as you guys know, it's somewhere

00:36:15.565 --> 00:36:17.780
in the neighborhood of
sunsettish afternoon.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.283
LAURA: Are the stores still open?

00:36:19.283 --> 00:36:21.053
TRAVIS: It's summer.

00:36:21.053 --> 00:36:22.715
MATT: You can certainly check.

00:36:22.715 --> 00:36:24.841
SAM: It's like La Vegas, it's always twilight.

00:36:24.841 --> 00:36:26.034
TRAVIS:: There you go.

00:36:26.034 --> 00:36:30.026
ORION: If you all don't mind, I
suggest we item up a bit,

00:36:30.026 --> 00:36:32.385
and before we get too late,

00:36:32.385 --> 00:36:34.406
and we get too drunk, Grog,

00:36:34.406 --> 00:36:37.213
go back to that lightning --
main-- manor-- lightning cage.

00:36:37.373 --> 00:36:38.606
LAURA: Oh, that place.

00:36:38.606 --> 00:36:40.029
MATT: House Thunderbrand?

00:36:40.029 --> 00:36:41.307
ORION: House Thunderbrand.

00:36:41.307 --> 00:36:42.226
(Matt laughs)

00:36:42.226 --> 00:36:43.729
TRAVIS: Where do we item up?

00:36:43.729 --> 00:36:45.496
Do we get potions and stuff somewhere?

00:36:45.496 --> 00:36:47.015
LAURA: Yeah, that's what we're looking for.

00:36:47.015 --> 00:36:49.688
LIAM: When you say too drunk, do
you mean "we" the adventurers

00:36:49.688 --> 00:36:52.779
or the humans back in Los Angeles?

00:36:52.779 --> 00:36:54.549
ORION: Both parties.

00:36:54.549 --> 00:36:55.549
Cross-plane.

00:36:56.954 --> 00:36:58.121
MARISHA: Cross-Realm.

00:36:58.121 --> 00:37:01.326
ORION: And I tell them what happened, again.

00:37:01.326 --> 00:37:02.753
SAM: What happened?

00:37:02.753 --> 00:37:04.894
ORION: Well, I went to this door because--

00:37:04.894 --> 00:37:06.894
SAM: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:37:09.493 --> 00:37:12.180
MATT: You later rested, shot arcane magic

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.210
at the home of arcane magic in Kraghammer.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:16.383
ORION: And if we are to go down into this cave,

00:37:16.383 --> 00:37:18.632
perhaps they have some
insight into what's going on

00:37:18.632 --> 00:37:19.557
there as well.

00:37:19.557 --> 00:37:20.691
Especially at this point in.

00:37:20.691 --> 00:37:22.821
LAURA: Let's hurry and try to get them
before they go to sleep.

00:37:22.821 --> 00:37:24.682
MARISHA: Maybe they have magical items.

00:37:24.682 --> 00:37:25.515
I want stuff.

00:37:25.515 --> 00:37:27.910
ORION: And I priorly had luck with more than--

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:30.125
TRAVIS: Like plant stuff or potion stuff?

00:37:31.969 --> 00:37:32.966
MARISHA: All stuff.

00:37:32.966 --> 00:37:35.532
LIAM: Have you had any luck
finding an arcane--

00:37:35.532 --> 00:37:37.443
LAURA: That's what we're talking about.

00:37:37.443 --> 00:37:38.781
LIAM: No, I know that.

00:37:38.781 --> 00:37:41.011
Did you send any fireballs at doors again

00:37:41.011 --> 00:37:42.700
like you've done in the past, or--?

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.543
ORION: Yes, I knocked, as I do often do.

00:37:46.543 --> 00:37:48.043
And nothing doing.

00:37:48.413 --> 00:37:49.453
LAURA: All right.

00:37:49.453 --> 00:37:50.286
LIAM: Got it.

00:37:50.286 --> 00:37:51.649
TRAVIS: So, magic stuffs.

00:37:51.649 --> 00:37:52.929
LAURA: Let's go find them.

00:37:52.929 --> 00:37:54.022
TALIESIN: All right.

00:37:54.022 --> 00:37:56.331
MARISHA: So wait--
it seems like they really

00:37:56.331 --> 00:37:58.209
don't want you in their door.

00:37:58.209 --> 00:38:00.031
It seems very heavily guarded.

00:38:00.031 --> 00:38:02.353
So what's our plan, we
just going to try again?

00:38:02.353 --> 00:38:04.286
LAURA: Well it was nighttime before.

00:38:04.286 --> 00:38:05.559
Maybe they'll be more--

00:38:05.561 --> 00:38:07.574
SAM: We're gonna do what we always do: wing it.

00:38:07.574 --> 00:38:09.155
TALIESIN: We're gonna try it again,

00:38:09.155 --> 00:38:10.776
except we're gonna watch this time.

00:38:10.776 --> 00:38:11.609
It'll be fun.

00:38:11.609 --> 00:38:12.442
MATT: There you go.

00:38:12.442 --> 00:38:13.275
MARISHA: Let's do it.

00:38:13.275 --> 00:38:14.768
LIAM: I walk back to the door, because we're all

00:38:14.768 --> 00:38:16.216
just standing outside the door.

00:38:16.216 --> 00:38:17.129
MATT: Correct.

00:38:17.129 --> 00:38:19.133
LIAM: I walk back to Hieris's
door and knock on it

00:38:19.133 --> 00:38:20.387
and poke my head in.

00:38:20.387 --> 00:38:21.765
Hieris, I'm sorry.

00:38:21.765 --> 00:38:23.484
MATT: You catch him with a
handful of dried fruit,

00:38:23.484 --> 00:38:24.317
"Hmph!

00:38:24.317 --> 00:38:25.150
"Hi!"

00:38:26.483 --> 00:38:27.616
LIAM: Just a quick question.

00:38:27.616 --> 00:38:30.405
We have no fucking idea what time it is.

00:38:30.405 --> 00:38:32.004
Because we usually use the sun.

00:38:32.004 --> 00:38:33.146
Do you know what hour it is?

00:38:33.146 --> 00:38:34.815
Are businesses open at the moment?

00:38:34.815 --> 00:38:36.415
MATT: He reaches over and grabs this

00:38:36.415 --> 00:38:39.064
really awesomely intricate
piece of clockwork on his desk.

00:38:39.064 --> 00:38:41.925
It's this brass, cylindrical
piece that as he pulls out

00:38:41.925 --> 00:38:44.260
you hear this (tongue clicking), fring!

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:46.342
And springs and things making
strange whirring sounds.

00:38:46.342 --> 00:38:49.443
"Oh, I reckon it's about
two hours from sunset."

00:38:49.443 --> 00:38:50.689
ORION: Oh, very good.

00:38:50.689 --> 00:38:52.860
LIAM: Are the stores open at the moment?

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.184
TRAVIS: Better question.

00:38:54.184 --> 00:38:55.597
MATT: "As far as I know, aye.

00:38:55.597 --> 00:38:56.983
"Depending on the store."

00:38:56.983 --> 00:38:58.297
LIAM: How much time do we have left?

00:38:58.297 --> 00:38:59.130
MATT: "Few hours."

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:00.699
LIAM: Oh, thank you, sir.

00:39:00.699 --> 00:39:02.215
MATT: "You sure you don't want to stay?"

00:39:02.215 --> 00:39:03.198
LIAM: Let's go shopping.

00:39:03.198 --> 00:39:04.922
TRAVIS: Thank you, Hieris thank you.
Oh, gotta go, sorry.

00:39:04.922 --> 00:39:05.755
MATT: "Goodbye."

00:39:05.755 --> 00:39:06.726
MARISHA: It's the mine that never sleeps.

00:39:06.726 --> 00:39:07.559
MATT: "Good luck."

00:39:07.559 --> 00:39:08.392
LIAM: Byeee!

00:39:08.392 --> 00:39:11.596
MATT: You hear the door open behind
you, and he starts waving

00:39:11.596 --> 00:39:12.527
at you guys.

00:39:12.527 --> 00:39:13.350
"Stay safe!"

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:14.613
TALIESIN: Stay regular.

00:39:14.613 --> 00:39:16.196
MARISHA: Eat some veggies!

00:39:16.196 --> 00:39:17.946
Fruit's bad for the diabetes!

00:39:17.946 --> 00:39:20.160
TRAVIS: Oh, I put my head back
in the door,

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.749
and I throw him a turkey leg
and a beef jerky stick.

00:39:24.053 --> 00:39:25.604
I gotta get rid of this stuff.

00:39:25.604 --> 00:39:27.047
It's been in here for years.

00:39:27.047 --> 00:39:29.732
TALIESIN: The fact that you just
checked your inventory

00:39:29.732 --> 00:39:31.187
for that worries me.

00:39:31.187 --> 00:39:33.529
TRAVIS: We gotta lotta shit in this bag.

00:39:33.529 --> 00:39:36.814
MATT: The bag of holding, not so much a freezer.

00:39:36.814 --> 00:39:38.947
TRAVIS: I didn't say it was good.

00:39:38.947 --> 00:39:40.344
I just want it out.

00:39:40.344 --> 00:39:41.747
MARISHA: And then you just throw it at him?

00:39:41.747 --> 00:39:44.172
MATT: The mildly rotted turkey
leg (imitates moist impact)

00:39:44.172 --> 00:39:45.066
across the floor.

00:39:45.066 --> 00:39:47.465
The remainder of what was
once meat, now a slush

00:39:47.465 --> 00:39:50.047
sloughing off the bone as it
slams across the stone floor.

00:39:50.047 --> 00:39:51.382
TRAVIS: It's really tender.

00:39:51.382 --> 00:39:53.134
LIAM: You're a goliath, you'll eat anything.

00:39:53.134 --> 00:39:54.712
TRAVIS: Yeah, those are the best parts.

00:39:54.715 --> 00:39:56.188
MATT: You see he immediately steps back

00:39:56.188 --> 00:39:57.261
and his face squints back.

00:39:57.261 --> 00:39:59.003
MARISHA: That's not polite, Grog.

00:39:59.003 --> 00:40:00.348
TRAVIS: I gave him a turkey leg.

00:40:00.348 --> 00:40:01.788
MATT: "It's the thought that counts."

00:40:01.788 --> 00:40:03.065
As he closes his door.

00:40:03.065 --> 00:40:04.171
ORION: Hold, hold on.

00:40:04.171 --> 00:40:06.740
Before he does that, I
cast prestidigitation,

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.277
and I clean it up real quick.

00:40:08.277 --> 00:40:10.086
MATT: Okay, that's really kind of you.

00:40:10.086 --> 00:40:12.147
ORION: And I hand him a parchment and go,

00:40:12.147 --> 00:40:14.697
if there's anything wrong,
just write the message on this,

00:40:14.697 --> 00:40:16.164
and we'll come help.

00:40:16.164 --> 00:40:17.237
If there's any emergency.

00:40:17.237 --> 00:40:19.362
And I hand him a parchment from
the Scroll of Telescription

00:40:19.362 --> 00:40:21.097
that I made.

00:40:21.097 --> 00:40:22.789
MATT: "All right. Thank you kindly."

00:40:22.822 --> 00:40:24.703
LAURA: How many pages is that scroll?

00:40:24.703 --> 00:40:25.918
Is it endless?

00:40:25.918 --> 00:40:27.956
ORION: I made like
15 tickets right now.

00:40:27.956 --> 00:40:29.652
And it takes me an hour to craft.

00:40:29.652 --> 00:40:32.032
MATT: He takes it from you with trepidation.

00:40:32.032 --> 00:40:34.842
You can see he probably hasn't
encountered dragonborn often,

00:40:34.842 --> 00:40:36.675
and he's like, "Thanks."

00:40:36.675 --> 00:40:38.646
ORION: Remember, dragonborn, we're good.

00:40:38.646 --> 00:40:39.958
MATT: "Right."

00:40:39.958 --> 00:40:40.845
ORION: So long.

00:40:40.845 --> 00:40:41.678
And I leave.

00:40:41.678 --> 00:40:42.511
MATT: "Thank ye."

00:40:42.511 --> 00:40:43.288
Closes the door.

00:40:43.288 --> 00:40:45.399
LAURA: Do you want to go with him
to the enchanting place

00:40:45.399 --> 00:40:47.138
or do you wanna go somewhere else?

00:40:47.138 --> 00:40:48.929
LIAM: I think I will go with
him just to keep him

00:40:48.929 --> 00:40:50.795
from setting fire to the entire city.

00:40:50.795 --> 00:40:52.871
LAURA: All right, shall we all go to the manor?

00:40:52.871 --> 00:40:54.891
TALIESIN: We have time, we might as well.

00:40:54.891 --> 00:40:56.337
ORION: Are we iteming up first?

00:40:56.337 --> 00:40:57.645
TALIESIN: I figure we do that after.

00:40:57.645 --> 00:40:59.038
LAURA: I think we'll do that.

00:40:59.038 --> 00:41:02.151
MARISHA: I'm gonna go ahead and
turn into a squirrel

00:41:02.151 --> 00:41:03.880
and hide in your pocket.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:04.713
LAURA: I like it.

00:41:04.713 --> 00:41:05.546
MARISHA: Okay.

00:41:05.546 --> 00:41:06.665
LAURA: Ugh, Grog.

00:41:06.665 --> 00:41:08.598
TRAVIS: What, it was a burp!

00:41:08.598 --> 00:41:10.960
(group laughs)

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.593
MATT: Technically in character.

00:41:12.593 --> 00:41:15.378
TRAVIS: Much worse from the
other end, I guarantee.

00:41:15.738 --> 00:41:19.119
SAM: Okay, so we're going
to House Thunderbeards?

00:41:19.119 --> 00:41:20.468
Thunderbirds?

00:41:20.468 --> 00:41:22.592
MATT: You guys head to the House Thunderbrand.

00:41:22.592 --> 00:41:23.745
SAM: Brand.

00:41:23.745 --> 00:41:24.578
MATT: All right.

00:41:24.578 --> 00:41:26.949
So, Tiberius leads you
to where it's residing.

00:41:26.949 --> 00:41:28.443
Once again you come upon

00:41:28.443 --> 00:41:30.164
what looks like a very out of place,

00:41:30.164 --> 00:41:33.924
very well-kept green lawn that
stretches for a good 60 feet

00:41:33.924 --> 00:41:37.168
before you see this
really beautiful-looking

00:41:37.168 --> 00:41:39.327
alabaster and gold building,

00:41:39.327 --> 00:41:41.958
slightly domed with these
four towers to each corner,

00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:44.016
with these blue
pointed crystals on top

00:41:44.016 --> 00:41:44.952
of each tower.

00:41:44.952 --> 00:41:46.468
LIAM: How does the grass grow down here?

00:41:46.468 --> 00:41:49.585
LAURA: Can we see any traps or
glyphs that are active?

00:41:49.585 --> 00:41:51.856
MATT: He points out
to you as you approach,

00:41:51.856 --> 00:41:55.086
there are a series of stone
sigils carved into the stonework

00:41:55.086 --> 00:41:57.101
that surrounds the exterior of the lawn.

00:41:57.101 --> 00:41:58.064
ORION: Those things!

00:41:58.064 --> 00:42:00.682
LAURA: Can we look around and
see if there's any way to,

00:42:00.682 --> 00:42:03.252
a bell to ring that's
outside of that area.

00:42:03.252 --> 00:42:04.685
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

00:42:06.631 --> 00:42:08.548
TALIESIN: Can I assist on that?

00:42:10.229 --> 00:42:13.241
LAURA: Yeah, please do, 'cause I rolled a one.

00:42:13.241 --> 00:42:14.074
One, baby.

00:42:14.074 --> 00:42:15.408
TALIESIN: It's a 10.

00:42:15.408 --> 00:42:17.602
LAURA: I failed it hard, I failed it.

00:42:17.602 --> 00:42:19.885
TALIESIN: If you rolled a one, there's
nothing I can do anyway.

00:42:19.885 --> 00:42:20.946
MATT: What'd you roll?

00:42:20.946 --> 00:42:22.219
LIAM: We ain't found shit.

00:42:22.219 --> 00:42:23.445
TRAVIS: She rolled a one.

00:42:23.445 --> 00:42:24.775
MATT: Rolled a one naturally?

00:42:24.775 --> 00:42:25.608
LAURA: I did.

00:42:25.608 --> 00:42:28.724
MATT: Best you can tell,
stonework's pretty solid.

00:42:28.724 --> 00:42:29.557
LAURA: Cool!

00:42:29.557 --> 00:42:30.390
Hey, it's a house.

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:31.920
MATT: Yeah.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.807
MATT: There are dwarves around. No.

00:42:33.807 --> 00:42:34.742
TRAVIS: Good.

00:42:34.742 --> 00:42:36.737
MATT: As you look about, it's
hard to tell the nature.

00:42:36.737 --> 00:42:37.704
This looks just like a lawn

00:42:37.704 --> 00:42:40.740
with a well-framed stone exterior.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:41.573
LAURA: Cool.

00:42:41.573 --> 00:42:42.996
MATT: But there's no fence.

00:42:42.996 --> 00:42:44.869
There's nothing keeping you from walking

00:42:44.869 --> 00:42:46.458
into the lawn and towards the building.

00:42:46.458 --> 00:42:49.397
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check
to see what light source

00:42:49.397 --> 00:42:51.396
is making all this grass grow,

00:42:51.396 --> 00:42:53.062
or if it's like magical growing?

00:42:53.062 --> 00:42:54.555
MATT: No nature check required.

00:42:54.555 --> 00:42:57.052
There is no light source,
other than the green rocks

00:42:57.052 --> 00:42:59.660
that generally permeate
the interior of Kraghammer

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.630
to give its kind of strange
luminescent atmosphere.

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:05.000
This kind of dull red glow
that's around the entire city.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.865
Other than a couple of
sparks of lantern light.

00:43:06.865 --> 00:43:08.295
There's no light source.

00:43:08.295 --> 00:43:09.588
SAM: I wonder what Keyleth is doing.

00:43:09.588 --> 00:43:10.760
She's squeaking an awful lot.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.293
(Marisha imitates squirrel)

00:43:12.293 --> 00:43:14.479
LAURA: Oh that's right, she's in my pocket.

00:43:14.479 --> 00:43:15.312
Hi!

00:43:15.312 --> 00:43:16.585
TRAVIS: So we just walk up and--

00:43:16.585 --> 00:43:18.223
LAURA: Can I pet her little head.

00:43:18.223 --> 00:43:20.445
ORION: No, I don't suggest that, Grog.

00:43:20.445 --> 00:43:22.006
I shoot firebolt.

00:43:22.006 --> 00:43:23.579
MATT: I forgot that wasn't water. (coughs)

00:43:23.585 --> 00:43:25.216
TALIESIN: Did you actually try to walk up?

00:43:25.216 --> 00:43:26.120
LIAM: Is there a front door?

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.979
TALIESIN: Perhaps you should,
before you do anything. Just try and walk up.

00:43:28.979 --> 00:43:30.432
MATT: From what you can see,

00:43:30.432 --> 00:43:33.161
There appears to be a large,
almost like beachwood,

00:43:33.161 --> 00:43:35.777
Light wood double door in
the front of the compound.

00:43:35.777 --> 00:43:36.610
LAURA: Grog's gonna go.

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:38.967
LIAM: I'm gonna use my rogue
abilities to walk up

00:43:38.967 --> 00:43:40.803
to the front door, and knock on it.

00:43:40.803 --> 00:43:41.636
ORION: Great.

00:43:41.636 --> 00:43:42.711
LAURA: Sorry Grog.

00:43:42.711 --> 00:43:44.619
TRAVIS: I have one job.
To take damage.

00:43:44.619 --> 00:43:46.385
LIAM: Can I see if I detect a bell?

00:43:46.385 --> 00:43:48.890
MARISHA: Is that a talent you
picked, is that a feat?

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:50.935
MATT: So, you walk towards the grass.

00:43:50.935 --> 00:43:52.882
You step onto the walkway that leads

00:43:52.882 --> 00:43:54.143
towards the front of the building.

00:43:54.143 --> 00:43:55.879
As soon as you cross into the threshold

00:43:55.879 --> 00:43:57.197
where those stone sigils are,

00:43:57.197 --> 00:43:58.658
you make a dexterity saving throw.

00:43:58.658 --> 00:43:59.491
(Travis laughs)

00:43:59.491 --> 00:44:01.056
LAURA: Oh no.

00:44:01.056 --> 00:44:02.415
Roll well, my brother.

00:44:02.415 --> 00:44:04.751
LIAM: This is really not good
for their business.

00:44:04.751 --> 00:44:07.044
[LIAM and LAURA groan]

00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:08.017
(group laughs)

00:44:09.171 --> 00:44:10.004
LIAM: 12.

00:44:10.004 --> 00:44:10.933
MATT: 12.

00:44:10.933 --> 00:44:11.766
LAURA: Oh no.

00:44:11.766 --> 00:44:14.648
MATT: So, as you pull your cloak
around you and take a few steps

00:44:14.648 --> 00:44:17.519
to jaunt upwards, suddenly
there's, you guys hear it.

00:44:17.519 --> 00:44:20.729
The strange (tongue clicking) sound,

00:44:20.729 --> 00:44:23.979
and a poof, poof of arcane
blue energy kind of,

00:44:23.979 --> 00:44:25.753
just pulses around his feet.

00:44:25.753 --> 00:44:27.576
You instinctively begin to
pull back, but as you do,

00:44:27.576 --> 00:44:29.390
there's a blast of blue electric energy

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:30.607
that (imitates explosion),

00:44:30.607 --> 00:44:32.813
streaks out from all around
you, shocking your body

00:44:32.813 --> 00:44:34.738
and throwing you about 15 feet back,

00:44:34.738 --> 00:44:36.557
straight onto your shoulders.

00:44:36.557 --> 00:44:38.900
You (imitates grinding) skid
to a halt (imitates thud).

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.609
LIAM: Which one of these do I roll for damage?

00:44:40.609 --> 00:44:42.351
TRAVIS: Electrified sound effect.

00:44:42.351 --> 00:44:43.184
MATT: You take...

00:44:43.184 --> 00:44:44.999
LIAM: Higigigigi!

00:44:44.999 --> 00:44:46.993
MATT: 14 points of lightning damage.

00:44:46.993 --> 00:44:47.826
LIAM: All right.

00:44:47.826 --> 00:44:50.503
ORION: This is as I'm paused
telling him not to do that.

00:44:50.503 --> 00:44:51.336
MATT: Yes.

00:44:51.336 --> 00:44:52.329
ORION: Don't!

00:44:52.329 --> 00:44:53.781
TRAVIS: Should've let me go.

00:44:53.781 --> 00:44:55.650
MATT: Your muscles eventually relax.

00:44:56.679 --> 00:44:59.458
ORION: As I was about to say,
that was going to happen.

00:44:59.458 --> 00:45:01.052
TRAVIS: We have a flying carpet.

00:45:01.052 --> 00:45:02.827
LAURA: Hey, we have a flying carpet!

00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:05.193
We have a flying carpet.

00:45:05.193 --> 00:45:07.846
ORION: Let me try one thing
that I didn't think to do last time.

00:45:07.846 --> 00:45:10.686
I'm gonna cast Dispel
Magic on the runestone.

00:45:10.686 --> 00:45:11.519
LIAM: Don't tase me, bro.

00:45:11.519 --> 00:45:12.352
MATT: Okay.

00:45:12.352 --> 00:45:13.185
Go ahead and--

00:45:13.185 --> 00:45:15.124
TRAVIS: It's really not that bad.

00:45:15.124 --> 00:45:16.170
MATT: Let's see.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:17.514
LAURA: Pull it out.

00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:18.347
TRAVIS: What?

00:45:18.347 --> 00:45:19.762
LAURA: Pull out the flying--

00:45:19.762 --> 00:45:20.865
MARISHA: Phrasing.

00:45:20.865 --> 00:45:23.031
SAM: Going for the handbook.

00:45:23.031 --> 00:45:25.309
MATT: Yeah, so we know what's going on.

00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:27.375
TRAVIS: Oh, the magic carpet, hold on.

00:45:29.084 --> 00:45:31.758
SAM: Guys, don't forget to
subscribe to Geek and Sundry.

00:45:31.758 --> 00:45:33.084
LAURA: Oh yeah!

00:45:33.084 --> 00:45:35.819
ORION: Oh, and I cast it at my fourth level slot.

00:45:35.822 --> 00:45:37.775
TRAVIS: You wanna fly it up to the door?

00:45:37.775 --> 00:45:39.338
MARISHA: What are you casting?

00:45:39.338 --> 00:45:40.501
ORION: Dispel magic.

00:45:40.501 --> 00:45:43.354
MATT: All right, make an arcana check.

00:45:43.354 --> 00:45:46.169
LAURA: It can't carry you, you're too heavy.

00:45:46.169 --> 00:45:47.822
TRAVIS: I said you, not me.

00:45:47.822 --> 00:45:49.866
LAURA: Oh, gimme that flying carpet.

00:45:49.866 --> 00:45:51.465
TRAVIS: That's what I said.

00:45:51.465 --> 00:45:52.298
ORION: 13.

00:45:52.298 --> 00:45:53.557
MATT: 13?

00:45:53.557 --> 00:45:54.390
ORION: Yeah.

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:55.223
MATT: Okay.

00:45:56.179 --> 00:46:00.417
As you concentrate and these
kind of shimmering bands

00:46:00.417 --> 00:46:03.457
of arcane energy wave off your
hands toward the enchantment,

00:46:03.457 --> 00:46:06.874
they impact and dissipate without effect.

00:46:06.874 --> 00:46:09.025
ORION: Are they fourth level or higher?

00:46:09.025 --> 00:46:10.193
MATT: They seem to be.

00:46:10.193 --> 00:46:11.026
ORION: Fuck.

00:46:11.026 --> 00:46:13.779
LAURA: I hop on the flying carpet.

00:46:13.779 --> 00:46:17.008
MATT: Okay, so you pull the flying
carpet, Mary Poppins-style,

00:46:17.008 --> 00:46:19.541
out of the bag of holding.
(imitates soft thud)

00:46:19.541 --> 00:46:22.239
LAURA: Yes. And see if I can fly up
and over to the door.

00:46:22.239 --> 00:46:24.653
TRAVIS: Do you wanna tie a rope
around your waist

00:46:24.653 --> 00:46:25.622
in case it goes bad?

00:46:25.622 --> 00:46:27.606
ORION: It's a flying magical carpet.

00:46:27.606 --> 00:46:29.076
LAURA: Somebody.

00:46:29.076 --> 00:46:29.908
Oh.

00:46:29.908 --> 00:46:30.741
Is that bad?

00:46:30.741 --> 00:46:31.754
Is that a bad idea?

00:46:31.754 --> 00:46:32.867
TRAVIS: No, do it.

00:46:32.867 --> 00:46:34.720
ORION: It's a flying magical carpet.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.023
SAM: What could go wrong?

00:46:36.023 --> 00:46:38.150
MARISHA: I think you'll just, like, hit a wall.

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:40.162
LAURA: What if the flying carpet gets ruined?

00:46:40.162 --> 00:46:41.425
SAM: Let's not do that then.

00:46:41.425 --> 00:46:42.695
TRAVIS: Oh my God, really?

00:46:42.695 --> 00:46:43.981
LIAM: It's not gonna be ruined.

00:46:43.981 --> 00:46:47.373
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, I'm in squirrel form.

00:46:47.373 --> 00:46:48.235
So I go out.

00:46:48.235 --> 00:46:49.728
LAURA: Oh, and you're with me.

00:46:49.728 --> 00:46:50.561
Let's both fly to the door.

00:46:50.561 --> 00:46:52.766
LIAM: I have nine healing potions--

00:46:52.766 --> 00:46:54.149
SAM: Hey, hold on, hold on.

00:46:54.149 --> 00:46:55.542
TRAVIS: What what, you turned invisible

00:46:55.542 --> 00:46:56.791
and walked inside a house last time.

00:46:56.791 --> 00:46:58.757
SAM: Yeah, I can do whatever we want.

00:46:58.757 --> 00:47:00.615
Do you want me to knock on the door,

00:47:00.615 --> 00:47:02.193
is that what we're trying to do?

00:47:02.193 --> 00:47:03.461
LAURA: Oh yeah, use your--

00:47:03.461 --> 00:47:04.604
SAM: Okay, so yes.

00:47:04.604 --> 00:47:07.345
I send an unseen servant
to knock on the door.

00:47:07.345 --> 00:47:09.445
TRAVIS: What kind, like a buddy?

00:47:09.445 --> 00:47:11.551
LAURA: Oh, he tried it before.

00:47:11.551 --> 00:47:14.008
MATT: Where do you create
the unseen servant?

00:47:14.008 --> 00:47:15.461
SAM: Where do I create it?

00:47:15.461 --> 00:47:16.284
MATT: Yeah.

00:47:16.284 --> 00:47:18.062
SAM: Right on the doorknocker.

00:47:18.062 --> 00:47:19.836
Like, hanging on the doorknocker.

00:47:19.836 --> 00:47:21.416
TRAVIS: Feet touching the ground?

00:47:21.416 --> 00:47:24.577
MATT: All right. So the distance unseen
servant can be summoned--

00:47:24.577 --> 00:47:25.484
LAURA: Oh no.

00:47:25.484 --> 00:47:28.847
MATT: I believe you may be able
to actually summon it

00:47:28.847 --> 00:47:31.265
within the boundary of
those arcane sigils.

00:47:31.265 --> 00:47:33.847
TRAVIS: I'm just sitting back
here holding the carpet.

00:47:33.847 --> 00:47:36.240
♫ I can show you the world ♫

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.175
(group laughs)

00:47:38.175 --> 00:47:39.578
MATT: 60 feet, so yeah.

00:47:39.578 --> 00:47:41.238
You go ahead and you walk
up to where that sigil is,

00:47:41.238 --> 00:47:43.618
you finish your spell,
you cast unseen servant.

00:47:43.618 --> 00:47:45.997
SAM: ♫ Unseen servant, ho ♫

00:47:45.997 --> 00:47:47.530
(group laughs)

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:48.575
MATT: Which he says every time.

00:47:48.575 --> 00:47:49.408
SAM: Yes.

00:47:49.408 --> 00:47:51.287
MATT: Every single time.

00:47:51.287 --> 00:47:52.991
You see this strange shift of air

00:47:52.991 --> 00:47:55.354
as some sort of humanoid
form then materializes

00:47:55.354 --> 00:47:57.201
in the opposite side of this boundary

00:47:57.201 --> 00:48:00.050
and stands at your ready and command.

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:01.861
SAM: We still haven't knocked
on the door, correct?

00:48:01.861 --> 00:48:02.694
GROUP: No.

00:48:02.694 --> 00:48:04.422
MATT: It's about a 60 foot walk.

00:48:04.422 --> 00:48:07.384
SAM: I command the unseen servant
to (imitates knocking)

00:48:07.384 --> 00:48:09.327
MATT: It kind of saunters over.

00:48:09.327 --> 00:48:11.747
You guys see this kind of shifting,

00:48:11.747 --> 00:48:14.184
barely, barely visible form make its way

00:48:14.184 --> 00:48:15.912
up to the front door.

00:48:15.912 --> 00:48:17.999
In the distance, you
hear a dull (knocking).

00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:23.688
Eventually, the door slightly opens.

00:48:23.688 --> 00:48:25.680
And you see a hunched figure

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:28.288
with bright white, chalk-white hair,

00:48:28.288 --> 00:48:30.592
kind of look out the doorway,

00:48:30.592 --> 00:48:33.143
"Oh, where's he come from?"

00:48:33.143 --> 00:48:34.881
Looking at the form in front of him.

00:48:34.881 --> 00:48:35.714
SAM: Oh, the ghost.

00:48:35.714 --> 00:48:36.547
MATT: Yeah.

00:48:38.068 --> 00:48:40.128
"That's where you come from.

00:48:40.128 --> 00:48:41.527
All right."

00:48:41.527 --> 00:48:42.360
SAM: Hello!

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.341
ORION: I'm waving.

00:48:43.341 --> 00:48:44.908
Hello.

00:48:44.908 --> 00:48:46.529
MATT: Opens the door, comes out.

00:48:46.529 --> 00:48:49.869
You now see this dwarven
figure hunched, very, very old,

00:48:49.869 --> 00:48:53.522
with a long, very, very
well-crafted brass staff,

00:48:53.522 --> 00:48:56.653
looks like a black or
purple gem at the top.

00:48:56.653 --> 00:48:58.392
Spectacles at the tip of its nose.

00:48:58.392 --> 00:49:01.347
And it begins to kind of shift
its way over towards you.

00:49:01.347 --> 00:49:03.388
(breathes heavily)

00:49:03.388 --> 00:49:05.076
ORION: Watch out for that rune.

00:49:05.076 --> 00:49:06.347
It's still on.

00:49:06.347 --> 00:49:07.633
SAM: I think he knows that.

00:49:07.633 --> 00:49:09.876
(laughing)

00:49:10.709 --> 00:49:13.042
MATT: Eventually making its way.

00:49:15.165 --> 00:49:17.039
TRAVIS: He's coming towards us?

00:49:17.039 --> 00:49:20.319
MATT: Yes. Walks right to the edge of the sigil.

00:49:20.992 --> 00:49:23.518
Puts his hand up, and the
unseen servant vanishes.

00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:30.064
He goes, "So, you have my attention."

00:49:30.594 --> 00:49:32.632
ORION: Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

00:49:32.632 --> 00:49:34.911
My name's Tiberius Stormwind,
and these are my friends.

00:49:34.911 --> 00:49:37.710
MATT: He puts his hand up and there's no sound

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:39.607
coming out of your mouth.

00:49:40.817 --> 00:49:41.797
(Travis laughs)

00:49:41.797 --> 00:49:43.334
SAM: Maybe we should listen.

00:49:43.334 --> 00:49:46.206
MATT: "This is the one who would-be
attacked our home abode

00:49:46.206 --> 00:49:48.706
not more than a few hours ago."

00:49:49.444 --> 00:49:51.397
SAM: He has emotional problems.

00:49:51.397 --> 00:49:52.831
MATT: "Apparently.

00:49:52.831 --> 00:49:55.726
He needs to learn respect
for other people's property."

00:49:55.726 --> 00:49:56.879
LAURA: Yes, he does.

00:49:56.879 --> 00:49:58.473
LIAM: We agree wholeheartedly.

00:49:58.473 --> 00:50:00.039
He's dragonborn, he's weird.

00:50:00.039 --> 00:50:01.603
He's a little weird.

00:50:02.766 --> 00:50:04.619
We're sorry to interrupt.

00:50:04.619 --> 00:50:07.726
I don't know, it's dinnertime, I think.

00:50:07.726 --> 00:50:09.927
I don't know if you've
heard yet, it just happened.

00:50:09.927 --> 00:50:12.053
We just fought some sort
of many-headed beast

00:50:12.053 --> 00:50:14.592
down at the mines, and Lord Greyspine

00:50:14.592 --> 00:50:16.752
is sending us in.

00:50:16.752 --> 00:50:19.403
So before we go, we were sent here.

00:50:19.403 --> 00:50:21.768
We were told you were
the dwarf to speak to

00:50:21.768 --> 00:50:22.851
if we needed--

00:50:23.708 --> 00:50:26.791
LAURA: To know about the magical entities.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:29.761
LIAM: I think it was just to get shit.

00:50:29.761 --> 00:50:30.924
(Travis and Sam laugh)

00:50:30.924 --> 00:50:32.273
LIAM: To get ready for those entities.

00:50:32.646 --> 00:50:35.470
MATT: "If you're looking to but
trinkets and magical oddities--

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:36.387
LAURA: Trinkets!

00:50:37.619 --> 00:50:39.339
MATT: "You've come to the wrong place.

00:50:39.339 --> 00:50:41.047
"This is a house of study.

00:50:41.047 --> 00:50:44.178
"This is where hardworking
dwarves of arcane persuasion

00:50:44.178 --> 00:50:46.123
"put their lives towards pursuing--

00:50:46.123 --> 00:50:47.329
TRAVIS: Say something!

00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:48.866
MATT: "--the magical forms and fields that--

00:50:48.866 --> 00:50:50.498
SAM: And we have come to seek your knowledge.

00:50:50.498 --> 00:50:51.331
MATT: "I'm sorry."

00:50:51.331 --> 00:50:52.164
Your sound is back.

00:50:52.164 --> 00:50:54.418
ORION: That's what I'm trying to
say is that I came here

00:50:54.418 --> 00:50:57.057
looking to ask about the arcane studies.

00:50:57.057 --> 00:50:58.607
I'm extremely interested in that.

00:50:58.607 --> 00:51:00.214
When I heard that your house

00:51:00.214 --> 00:51:02.229
Was the only one that was
in that particular study,

00:51:02.229 --> 00:51:04.048
I was immensely intrigued.

00:51:04.048 --> 00:51:06.628
I respect the arcane
arts so much that it's,

00:51:06.628 --> 00:51:07.709
well, it's been my life.

00:51:07.709 --> 00:51:10.928
And right now, we're in bit of a situation

00:51:10.928 --> 00:51:12.874
where we have to go
slaughter a bunch of nasties

00:51:12.874 --> 00:51:14.756
in apparently one of your mines.

00:51:14.756 --> 00:51:17.012
And we don't know the source.

00:51:17.012 --> 00:51:19.273
And it appears to be of
an extreme arcane nature

00:51:19.273 --> 00:51:22.495
of the dark sense, and I
figured we could come to you

00:51:22.495 --> 00:51:25.075
for help and some kind of guidance.

00:51:25.075 --> 00:51:27.211
And I will-- Scanlan, will you stop it!

00:51:27.211 --> 00:51:31.738
And it appears that you
very well know something

00:51:31.738 --> 00:51:35.808
that we could learn from, with
all due respect, of course.

00:51:35.808 --> 00:51:37.551
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:51:37.551 --> 00:51:39.004
MARISHA: Holy shit. What the fuck.

00:51:41.373 --> 00:51:42.206
Breathe.

00:51:45.247 --> 00:51:46.080
ORION: 11.

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.871
TRAVIS: God, what is with these rolls?

00:51:47.871 --> 00:51:49.463
TALIESIN: We've been middling.

00:51:49.463 --> 00:51:50.766
LAURA: Terrible rolls today.

00:51:50.766 --> 00:51:53.169
MATT: The dwarf gives you
a disapproving brow shift

00:51:53.169 --> 00:51:57.312
and goes, "Look, I mean no disrespect.

00:51:58.773 --> 00:52:02.466
"But understand, this is a dwarven house

00:52:02.466 --> 00:52:05.137
"of arcane practitioning and study.

00:52:05.137 --> 00:52:07.061
"Don't see any dwarves among ya.

00:52:07.061 --> 00:52:09.214
"I think our business here is concluded."

00:52:09.214 --> 00:52:12.202
"If you're looking to buy stuff, we produce

00:52:12.202 --> 00:52:16.362
"and sell through the Value
of Valor house of sale."

00:52:16.362 --> 00:52:18.907
TRAVIS: Oh Tiberius, can't you become a dwarf?

00:52:18.907 --> 00:52:21.575
TALIESIN: Of course, sir, we completely understand

00:52:21.575 --> 00:52:23.231
if you're not up to such a challenge.

00:52:23.231 --> 00:52:25.359
It makes perfect sense, and
we'll be more than happy to go

00:52:25.359 --> 00:52:27.233
and buy some wares somewhere else

00:52:27.233 --> 00:52:28.686
if this is too much for you.

00:52:28.686 --> 00:52:30.238
MATT: "Bah! Challenge."

00:52:30.238 --> 00:52:32.445
ORION: I will send you my associate.

00:52:32.445 --> 00:52:34.745
The dwarf turns around
and begins walking away

00:52:34.745 --> 00:52:35.629
with his staff.

00:52:35.629 --> 00:52:37.518
LAURA: What a beautiful staff that is.

00:52:37.518 --> 00:52:40.361
ORION: I'm gonna cast Alter Self
on myself to be a dwarf.

00:52:40.361 --> 00:52:42.991
TRAVIS: And jump behind me,
and act like you just--

00:52:42.991 --> 00:52:45.486
LAURA: Actually sir, we do have a dwarf with us.

00:52:45.486 --> 00:52:47.611
MARISHA: No wait wait wait! Cast it on me!

00:52:47.611 --> 00:52:48.838
I'm a squirrel in her pocket.

00:52:48.838 --> 00:52:51.011
ORION: Oh shit, I cast it on her instead.

00:52:51.011 --> 00:52:53.536
(loud thudding)

00:52:53.536 --> 00:52:56.480
LAURA: We have a dwarf with us who wanted

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.069
to actually say hello to--

00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:59.776
TRAVIS: (whispering) What's your dwarf name?

00:52:59.776 --> 00:53:01.439
MATT: Turns around. Saunters back.

00:53:01.439 --> 00:53:02.905
ORION: Keyleth, where have you been?

00:53:02.905 --> 00:53:04.454
MARISHA: I guess it's Keyleth.

00:53:04.454 --> 00:53:05.847
MATT: Looks at you.

00:53:05.847 --> 00:53:07.320
TRAVIS: Keyleth Kraghammer.

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:10.320
SAM: You better fucking speak dwarvish.

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.398
MATT: Smiles for a second as
he looks at you and goes,

00:53:12.398 --> 00:53:14.997
"Ah, how nice to meet you.

00:53:14.997 --> 00:53:16.524
"Where are you from?"

00:53:16.524 --> 00:53:18.135
MARISHA: (bad Scottish accent) Oh, hello.

00:53:18.135 --> 00:53:20.579
(group laughs)

00:53:20.579 --> 00:53:21.412
LAURA: Oh, shit.

00:53:21.412 --> 00:53:23.890
(Liam speaks in
Swedish-accented gibberish)

00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:25.095
SAM: Ya, from Sweden.

00:53:25.095 --> 00:53:27.313
TRAVIS: I'm gonna choke on a chip. (coughs)

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:31.211
MARISHA: Keyleth is not good at this.

00:53:31.211 --> 00:53:33.235
LIAM: Roll with it player, roll with it.

00:53:33.235 --> 00:53:36.318
MARISHA: I hail from the mountains up north.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:42.093
ORION: She had an accident on the way over here.

00:53:42.093 --> 00:53:43.376
We were hoping maybe--

00:53:43.376 --> 00:53:46.185
MATT: Roll a persuasion roll with disadvantage.

00:53:46.185 --> 00:53:47.725
(all talking and laughing)

00:53:47.725 --> 00:53:50.134
MATT: You. Roll with disadvantage.

00:53:52.022 --> 00:53:54.932
LIAM: Let the dice act better
than us tonight, please.

00:53:54.932 --> 00:53:56.390
(group laughs)

00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:58.590
TRAVIS: (high-pitched voice) Oh, hello!

00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:01.480
MARISHA: Wait, persuasion--I don't have--oh, wait.

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:02.698
I have a zero.

00:54:02.698 --> 00:54:03.538
Eight.

00:54:03.538 --> 00:54:04.739
MATT: That's your first roll.

00:54:04.739 --> 00:54:05.945
Now roll again.

00:54:05.945 --> 00:54:07.038
MARISHA: Oh, I have advantage.

00:54:07.038 --> 00:54:08.301
MATT: No, you have disadvantage.

00:54:08.301 --> 00:54:09.537
MARISHA: Oh, disadvantage.

00:54:09.537 --> 00:54:10.370
So eight.

00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:11.203
MATT: Eight.

00:54:11.203 --> 00:54:14.953
He goes, "I've been
practicing the arcane arts

00:54:14.953 --> 00:54:17.996
"for over 250 years.

00:54:19.541 --> 00:54:22.609
MARISHA: And I've been practicing
my Cornwall accent

00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:24.026
for five minutes.

00:54:25.608 --> 00:54:27.172
Shit.

00:54:27.172 --> 00:54:28.861
MATT: He raises his hand,

00:54:28.861 --> 00:54:31.436
and the Alter Self spell dissipates.

00:54:31.436 --> 00:54:34.015
Where stands Keyleth.

00:54:34.015 --> 00:54:36.871
SAM: Oh Keyleth, you've been
lying to us this whole time?

00:54:36.871 --> 00:54:38.030
(Travis laughs)

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:39.040
ORION: Who are you?

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.632
SAM: We thought you were a dwarf.

00:54:40.632 --> 00:54:43.064
LIAM: Vax steps forward, steps in
front of Keyleth and says,

00:54:43.064 --> 00:54:44.371
Good sir dwarf.

00:54:44.371 --> 00:54:46.295
Clearly we are idiots.

00:54:46.295 --> 00:54:47.194
We are--

00:54:48.382 --> 00:54:50.265
MATT: "That's the first true thing you've said

00:54:50.265 --> 00:54:52.408
"since you've called me out of my home."

00:54:52.408 --> 00:54:53.833
LIAM: Stay with me on this.

00:54:53.833 --> 00:54:56.069
We are strangers in a strange land.

00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:58.657
However, we are working
with Lord Greyspine

00:54:58.657 --> 00:55:01.464
to empty your mines and end the evil

00:55:01.464 --> 00:55:02.940
that is spewing forth from them.

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:05.578
Now I know that we are a bit stupid--

00:55:05.578 --> 00:55:06.539
(group laughs)

00:55:06.539 --> 00:55:07.770
--in a number of ways.

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:09.140
LAURA: But we fight well.

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:11.927
LIAM: But we fight well, and we
have the best of intentions,

00:55:11.927 --> 00:55:15.196
and when it counts, we're there.

00:55:15.196 --> 00:55:18.791
We just need a little bit of
help going into the mines.

00:55:18.791 --> 00:55:21.593
And again, Lord Greyspine himself sent us,

00:55:21.593 --> 00:55:23.409
so please excuse my--

00:55:23.409 --> 00:55:24.452
TALIEISIN: Cornwall?

00:55:24.452 --> 00:55:25.838
LIAM: --challenged friends.

00:55:25.838 --> 00:55:27.130
TRAVIS: My cornhole friends.

00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:29.065
LIAM: We're here to help.

00:55:29.065 --> 00:55:29.898
I promise.

00:55:31.166 --> 00:55:33.149
TRAVIS: That's a very Disney moment.

00:55:33.149 --> 00:55:35.184
LIAM: Wink, wink, wink.

00:55:35.184 --> 00:55:36.477
LAURA: I wink twice.

00:55:36.477 --> 00:55:37.818
Make a persuasion roll at disadvantage.

00:55:37.818 --> 00:55:39.716
LAURA: Can I assist him 'cause I winked?

00:55:39.716 --> 00:55:40.549
MATT: No.

00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:41.382
LAURA: Damn it.

00:55:41.382 --> 00:55:42.375
TRAVIS: It's a powerful wink.

00:55:42.376 --> 00:55:44.550
MATT: It's a powerful wink,
but not this powerful.

00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:46.695
Not the way this
conversation's been going.

00:55:46.695 --> 00:55:47.748
TRAVIS: Yeah, apparently not.

00:55:47.748 --> 00:55:48.581
Oh hello!

00:55:48.581 --> 00:55:50.437
LIAM: Best roll of the night.

00:55:50.437 --> 00:55:52.853
I rolled a 20 and a 17.

00:55:52.853 --> 00:55:53.904
So 19.

00:55:53.904 --> 00:55:54.737
MATT: 19.

00:55:57.235 --> 00:55:59.865
He glares at you two and goes,

00:55:59.865 --> 00:56:01.695
"I've said my piece.

00:56:01.695 --> 00:56:02.528
Good luck to you all."

00:56:02.528 --> 00:56:03.361
(group groans)

00:56:03.361 --> 00:56:04.665
SAM: Further.

00:56:04.665 --> 00:56:06.109
LAURA: If you had gotten the 20.

00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:07.287
LIAM: How about a chocolate-covered mallomar?

00:56:07.287 --> 00:56:08.534
SAM: I'm gonna have one more try at this.

00:56:08.534 --> 00:56:09.367
MATT: He turns around and starts walking away.

00:56:09.367 --> 00:56:11.707
SAM: There must be so many
arcane things down there

00:56:11.707 --> 00:56:13.613
that we will discover and bring to you

00:56:13.613 --> 00:56:15.113
upon finding them.

00:56:15.113 --> 00:56:16.466
LAURA: Good call, Scanlan.

00:56:16.466 --> 00:56:18.936
SAM: Things that you could
use for your research.

00:56:18.936 --> 00:56:19.963
Historical items.

00:56:19.963 --> 00:56:22.178
MATT: As he's still walking
away, you hear him shout

00:56:22.178 --> 00:56:23.342
over his shoulder,

00:56:23.342 --> 00:56:26.301
"And when you bring them, then we'll talk!"

00:56:26.301 --> 00:56:27.587
SAM: Okay, that's fair.

00:56:27.587 --> 00:56:30.057
MATT: "Till then, good day, and don't bother me

00:56:30.057 --> 00:56:31.078
when I'm eating."

00:56:31.078 --> 00:56:32.872
LAURA: Thank you, Lord Thunderclap.

00:56:32.872 --> 00:56:35.298
LIAM: This game has consequences.

00:56:35.298 --> 00:56:36.364
MATT: At which he shouts again

00:56:36.364 --> 00:56:39.268
at a booming, booming
prestidigitation voice,

00:56:40.568 --> 00:56:43.488
"It's THUNDERBRAND!"

00:56:43.816 --> 00:56:45.649
LAURA: That's what I meant.

00:56:46.366 --> 00:56:47.965
MATT: You hear the door slam, boom!

00:56:47.965 --> 00:56:49.101
TRAVIS: That was fun.

00:56:49.101 --> 00:56:50.284
SAM: That was great!

00:56:50.284 --> 00:56:51.970
LAURA: Should we go buy some potions then?

00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:53.273
TALIESIN: Yes, let's go buy some potions.

00:56:53.273 --> 00:56:55.253
SAM: He gave us a little bit of information.

00:56:55.253 --> 00:56:57.324
The valve of valva, what's it? Valor of -

00:56:57.324 --> 00:56:58.477
TRAVIS: Vulva?

00:56:58.487 --> 00:57:00.050
SAM: The place to place to go buy potions.

00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:01.543
ORION: The House of Valor.

00:57:01.543 --> 00:57:02.956
SAM: No, the valva--

00:57:02.956 --> 00:57:04.945
ORION: It's not the
House of Vulva, Scanlan.

00:57:04.945 --> 00:57:06.157
MATT: The Value of Valor.

00:57:06.157 --> 00:57:07.738
LAURA AND SAM: The Value of Valor!

00:57:07.738 --> 00:57:09.732
TRAVIS: If you want to visit the House of Vulva,

00:57:09.732 --> 00:57:11.705
you and I can go later but not now.

00:57:11.705 --> 00:57:14.605
LAURA: The Value of Valor, let's go find that.

00:57:14.605 --> 00:57:17.374
ORION: (in Marisha's bad accent)
Let's go to the North.

00:57:17.374 --> 00:57:18.669
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

00:57:18.669 --> 00:57:20.579
I didn't think about the fact that I was

00:57:20.579 --> 00:57:22.119
gonna have to do an accent.

00:57:22.119 --> 00:57:23.650
I'm not good with that stuff.

00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:25.126
LAURA: It's okay, Keyleth.

00:57:25.126 --> 00:57:27.064
TRAVIS: Women, fighting, ale, that's my job.

00:57:27.064 --> 00:57:29.177
MATT: So after a bit of discussion,
you manage to make your way

00:57:29.177 --> 00:57:30.010
around town.

00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:31.660
You eventually find your
way to the Value of Valor,

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:32.493
which is a--

00:57:32.493 --> 00:57:33.610
LAURA: Terrible.

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:35.554
MATT: (laughs) It's a stone building.

00:57:35.554 --> 00:57:37.703
Like reddish brick,
it looks in construction.

00:57:37.703 --> 00:57:39.329
With fine purple--

00:57:39.329 --> 00:57:42.196
LAURA: Please be open, please
be open, please be open.

00:57:42.196 --> 00:57:44.464
MATT: (laughs) Fine purple
tapestries in the front

00:57:44.464 --> 00:57:47.894
that show various battles
of old dwarven history

00:57:47.894 --> 00:57:51.509
of two glowing enchanted
permalight lanterns

00:57:51.509 --> 00:57:53.360
hanging from the front.

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:54.193
TALIESIN: Classy.

00:57:54.193 --> 00:57:56.987
MATT: And an entryway that is currently open

00:57:56.987 --> 00:57:59.705
and a warmly-lit interior welcomes you.

00:57:59.705 --> 00:58:00.628
TRAVIS: Awesome.

00:58:00.628 --> 00:58:01.494
LIAM: So easy.

00:58:01.494 --> 00:58:03.037
SAM: Hey, before we go in there

00:58:03.037 --> 00:58:05.775
and just make asses of ourselves,

00:58:05.775 --> 00:58:08.900
As a group, what do you
think we need to get down

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:09.733
into these mines?

00:58:09.733 --> 00:58:10.566
LAURA: Potions.

00:58:10.566 --> 00:58:11.965
TALIESIN: Healing potions.

00:58:11.965 --> 00:58:13.738
SAM: Healing potions.
Some light sources--

00:58:13.738 --> 00:58:14.731
ORION: We don't need that.

00:58:14.731 --> 00:58:15.932
SAM: Climbing anything?

00:58:15.932 --> 00:58:17.235
LAURA: I have climbing gear.

00:58:17.235 --> 00:58:18.744
SAM: I have some climbing gear, but--

00:58:18.744 --> 00:58:20.796
LAURA: That's included in
the dungeoneering kit, right?

00:58:20.796 --> 00:58:21.629
MATT: Yes.

00:58:21.629 --> 00:58:23.902
SAM: Oh, what about something for breathing?

00:58:23.902 --> 00:58:26.159
SAM: Like what if we get trapped
down there with no air?

00:58:26.159 --> 00:58:28.189
ORION: Don't worry about that.

00:58:28.189 --> 00:58:31.566
LAURA: She can make plants, and
we'll get plenty of oxygen.

00:58:31.566 --> 00:58:33.340
MARISHA: Oxygen's good, although
if we have something

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:35.837
to help with poison, that might be good.

00:58:35.837 --> 00:58:37.540
Can we get some antidotes?

00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:39.963
LIAM: Vex.
How much gold do we have at the moment?

00:58:40.631 --> 00:58:43.358
LAURA: That is a wonderful question, brother.

00:58:43.358 --> 00:58:45.772
ORION: By the way, I pull out a bottle of air.

00:58:45.772 --> 00:58:48.917
Just an empty bottle and
go: and plus, we have this.

00:58:48.917 --> 00:58:53.014
LAURA: We will more than double our
gold if we take this mission.

00:58:53.014 --> 00:58:55.176
TRAVIS: So we got like 24,000 gold pieces?

00:58:55.176 --> 00:58:56.435
LAURA: Less than that.

00:58:56.435 --> 00:58:57.339
TRAVIS: 23 thousand.

00:58:57.339 --> 00:58:58.172
LAURA: Less than that.

00:58:58.172 --> 00:58:59.005
TRAVIS: 22 thousand?

00:58:59.005 --> 00:59:00.477
LIAM: More than double, that means
it could be one thousand.

00:59:00.477 --> 00:59:02.260
'Cause anything is more than double.

00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:03.593
LAURA: I don't like sharing.

00:59:03.593 --> 00:59:04.723
TRAVIS: Math is stupid.

00:59:04.723 --> 00:59:07.074
SAM: All right, we go into the House of Vulva.

00:59:07.074 --> 00:59:07.907
MATT: All right.

00:59:08.611 --> 00:59:10.222
SAM: Open your vulva!

00:59:10.222 --> 00:59:13.315
MATT: That's not what it's called.

00:59:13.315 --> 00:59:16.669
(group laughs)

00:59:16.669 --> 00:59:19.580
TRAVIS: Are you sure you don't wanna
think about renaming it now?

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:23.685
MATT: It's the Value of Valor guys, come on! (whines)

00:59:23.685 --> 00:59:25.445
MATT: All right, so.

00:59:25.445 --> 00:59:27.030
TALIESIN: You're tearing the party apart.

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:29.026
LIAM: Tearing me apart, Lisa.

00:59:29.026 --> 00:59:31.506
MATT: A giant boulder falls out of nowhere
and crushes Grog.

00:59:31.506 --> 00:59:32.612
(group laughs)

00:59:32.612 --> 00:59:34.936
MATT: So you make your way inside.

00:59:34.936 --> 00:59:39.468
Suddenly, hit with the smell
of heavy incense and jasmine.

00:59:39.468 --> 00:59:41.865
This is the equivalent of
a Psychic Eye Bookshop.

00:59:41.865 --> 00:59:42.850
ORION: Groovy!

00:59:42.850 --> 00:59:44.197
MARISHA: Oh, we were just there.

00:59:44.197 --> 00:59:45.030
TALIESIN: We were just there.

00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:45.863
TRAVIS: Nag champa.

00:59:45.863 --> 00:59:47.074
MATT: You walk inside.

00:59:47.074 --> 00:59:48.542
There's not a lot of folks inside

00:59:48.542 --> 00:59:50.483
looking about the establishment.

00:59:50.483 --> 00:59:53.678
But there is one person
sitting at the front desk,

00:59:53.678 --> 00:59:55.750
which is a beautiful long oak table

00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:59.071
with a red trim
that hangs to the ceiling.

00:59:59.071 --> 01:00:00.098
Not a dwarf, actually.

01:00:00.098 --> 01:00:02.944
What you see there appears
to be an elven individual,

01:00:02.944 --> 01:00:05.234
sitting at wait, hair
pulled back behind the ears.

01:00:05.234 --> 01:00:07.682
Very, very slight, thin build.

01:00:07.682 --> 01:00:09.831
And smiles as you enter and says,

01:00:09.831 --> 01:00:12.641
"Welcome to my establishment,
may I help you?"

01:00:12.641 --> 01:00:15.787
LAURA: We both stand a little taller,
and try to look more noble.

01:00:15.787 --> 01:00:16.620
LIAM: Hello.

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:17.453
MATT: "Yes."

01:00:17.453 --> 01:00:19.907
LIAM: It's a beautiful shop you have.

01:00:19.907 --> 01:00:23.636
It's so startling to find
an elven establishment here

01:00:23.636 --> 01:00:25.807
in the middle of Kraghammer.

01:00:25.807 --> 01:00:27.392
How did this come about?

01:00:27.392 --> 01:00:28.352
MATT: "Well.

01:00:29.372 --> 01:00:30.653
"They didn't have one."

01:00:30.653 --> 01:00:32.824
(Travis and Sam laugh)

01:00:32.824 --> 01:00:35.292
"And I found there was
perhaps money to be made

01:00:35.292 --> 01:00:37.081
"in starting one.

01:00:37.081 --> 01:00:39.316
"I've been here for over a hundred years."

01:00:39.316 --> 01:00:41.930
TRAVIS: Oh sh--
Are you guys that old?

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:42.160
LIAM: No, we are not.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.538
ORION: So business is good?

01:00:43.538 --> 01:00:45.231
MATT: "Dwarves have a hard time

01:00:45.231 --> 01:00:47.161
"buying from those
who are not dwarves.

01:00:47.161 --> 01:00:49.033
"But I've made my established connections
with business individuals.

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:54.210
"So, what can I help you with?

01:00:54.210 --> 01:00:56.852
TALIESIN: We're in the market for
some healing potions

01:00:56.852 --> 01:00:58.055
to start with.

01:00:58.055 --> 01:00:59.333
TRAVIS: Yep, yep.

01:00:59.333 --> 01:01:01.885
MATT: "Of which intensity are you looking for?"

01:01:02.012 --> 01:01:04.704
TRAVIS:: Level three for this one, please.

01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:05.680
Two.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.497
MATT: "So looking for a superior healing potion."

01:01:08.497 --> 01:01:09.914
TRAVIS: Yeah, superior.

01:01:09.914 --> 01:01:12.461
MATT: "I've only got two of those currently."

01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:14.628
LAURA: They're expensive, Grog.

01:01:14.628 --> 01:01:16.799
MARISHA: We don't have Pike, though.

01:01:16.799 --> 01:01:19.514
MATT: "I can sell you the two
superior healing potions."

01:01:19.514 --> 01:01:21.412
MARISHA: I'm still not feeling well.

01:01:21.412 --> 01:01:24.180
MATT: "Those will run you 1,500 gold pieces each."

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:24.993
TRAVIS: Fuck!

01:01:24.993 --> 01:01:26.012
Really?!

01:01:26.012 --> 01:01:28.778
TALIESIN: This is why you buy
medium healing potions.

01:01:28.778 --> 01:01:31.700
MARISHA: On second thought, I'll just
read some books tonight,

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.235
TRAVIS: I take damage &lt;i&gt;fast&lt;/i&gt;.

01:01:33.235 --> 01:01:35.258
MARISHA: Refresh myself on my healing spells.

01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:37.091
LAURA: Can I ask your name?

01:01:37.091 --> 01:01:39.977
MATT: He gives you a keen
look and says, "Tremaine."

01:01:39.977 --> 01:01:41.267
LAURA: Tremaine.

01:01:41.267 --> 01:01:42.736
TRAVIS: Oh, here we go.

01:01:42.736 --> 01:01:44.059
(Liam and Taliesin laugh)

01:01:44.059 --> 01:01:45.263
MARISHA: It's what she's good at.

01:01:45.263 --> 01:01:47.173
TRAVIS: Everybody take five while we haggle.

01:01:47.173 --> 01:01:48.317
LAURA: I'm just saying.

01:01:48.317 --> 01:01:50.205
We're heading into the mines.

01:01:50.205 --> 01:01:52.076
We are going to encounter very many

01:01:52.076 --> 01:01:54.326
arcane objects potentially.

01:01:55.506 --> 01:01:57.743
In fact, Lord Thunderbrand
sent us over here.

01:01:57.743 --> 01:01:59.176
That's his name, right?

01:01:59.176 --> 01:02:00.339
TRAVIS: You got it.

01:02:00.339 --> 01:02:01.776
TALIESIN: You did it right.

01:02:01.776 --> 01:02:04.614
LAURA: Sent us over here telling
us to find his wares here.

01:02:04.614 --> 01:02:06.398
And we've made a deal with him

01:02:06.398 --> 01:02:10.565
that if we find arcane
objects we could potentially,

01:02:14.517 --> 01:02:17.330
you know, I lost track
of what I was saying,

01:02:17.330 --> 01:02:19.053
but you get the idea.

01:02:19.053 --> 01:02:20.078
SAM: Oh boy.

01:02:20.078 --> 01:02:21.203
ORION: What would you suggest?

01:02:21.203 --> 01:02:23.787
And do you know of any
things we should particularly

01:02:23.787 --> 01:02:25.820
buy before we leave going into the mines

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:27.853
and encountering nasty naga-type creatures

01:02:27.853 --> 01:02:29.621
and other kind of things.

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:31.384
MATT: "Superior healing potions."

01:02:31.384 --> 01:02:33.180
TRAVIS: How much are they each, 1500?

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.640
MATT: "1500 gold pieces."

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.245
TRAVIS: I'll take one for me, thank you.

01:02:36.245 --> 01:02:37.118
MATT: "Very well."

01:02:37.118 --> 01:02:40.026
LAURA: We'll very much like to
perhaps make a deal with you,

01:02:40.026 --> 01:02:42.192
that we'll bring you
objects of arcane nature

01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:44.609
for a discount on your wares.

01:02:46.912 --> 01:02:48.455
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

01:02:48.455 --> 01:02:49.288
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

01:02:49.288 --> 01:02:50.121
I just paid for--

01:02:50.121 --> 01:02:51.403
LAURA: Oh, no you didn't.

01:02:51.403 --> 01:02:52.262
Not yet.

01:02:52.262 --> 01:02:53.095
LIAM: Roll, sister.

01:02:53.095 --> 01:02:56.716
LAURA: Oh, come on, no whammies, no whammies.

01:02:56.716 --> 01:02:57.897
Okay, well.

01:02:57.897 --> 01:02:58.730
15, hm?

01:03:00.107 --> 01:03:01.607
TRAVIS: He's an old elf.

01:03:03.241 --> 01:03:04.074
MATT: He says,

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:08.937
"And I appreciate this perhaps offer.

01:03:08.937 --> 01:03:11.022
"Once you return from your mines--"

01:03:11.022 --> 01:03:12.480
LAURA: I know, I know, I know.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.139
MATT: "--with these magical accoutrements,

01:03:14.139 --> 01:03:15.483
you are more than welcome
to bring them here,

01:03:15.483 --> 01:03:17.211
and we'll make a deal.

01:03:17.211 --> 01:03:20.561
LAURA: How many dragons have
you come across, sir?

01:03:20.561 --> 01:03:22.391
Are you interested in dragon parts?

01:03:22.391 --> 01:03:24.698
TRAVIS: Oh, we have a lot of dragon bits.

01:03:24.698 --> 01:03:27.316
MATT: He extends his hand to a shelf on the side

01:03:27.316 --> 01:03:28.832
labeled, "Dragon Parts."

01:03:28.832 --> 01:03:29.665
LAURA: Oh.

01:03:29.665 --> 01:03:30.596
(group laughs)

01:03:30.596 --> 01:03:32.209
LAURA: Lovely.

01:03:32.488 --> 01:03:35.398
MATT: "And to answer your question, three."

01:03:35.398 --> 01:03:36.298
LAURA: Oh, really?

01:03:36.298 --> 01:03:37.471
TRAVIS: What about basilisk eggs?

01:03:37.471 --> 01:03:39.606
LAURA: What kind of dragons, actually?

01:03:39.606 --> 01:03:41.126
MATT: "What was your question, sir?"

01:03:41.126 --> 01:03:45.697
TRAVIS: We have also, if you're
interested in trade,

01:03:45.697 --> 01:03:49.114
basilisk eggs and parts of an umber hulk.

01:03:50.233 --> 01:03:51.638
LIAM: And a troll dick.

01:03:51.638 --> 01:03:52.856
TRAVIS: No, that's gone.

01:03:52.856 --> 01:03:53.994
(group laughs)

01:03:53.994 --> 01:03:57.123
TRAVIS: We flogged him with it
and then it disappeared.

01:03:57.123 --> 01:03:58.873
LIAM: I detract my offer.

01:04:00.049 --> 01:04:02.049
TRAVIS: It was used very well.

01:04:05.443 --> 01:04:08.425
MATT: He gives you a very concerned look.

01:04:08.425 --> 01:04:10.217
TRAVIS: I'm a collector of sorts.

01:04:10.217 --> 01:04:11.925
MATT: Both of you. And he goes,

01:04:11.925 --> 01:04:12.925
And he goes,

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:19.786
"I work in trade, meaning
gold pieces for my wares."

01:04:19.786 --> 01:04:20.619
LAURA: Yes.

01:04:20.619 --> 01:04:22.664
MATT: "If you have interest, purchase.

01:04:22.664 --> 01:04:25.534
"If not, I have other
business to attend to."

01:04:25.534 --> 01:04:27.534
SAM: Any other healing potions to buy?

01:04:27.534 --> 01:04:28.526
Come on people.

01:04:28.526 --> 01:04:29.697
LAURA: Maybe a moderate.

01:04:29.697 --> 01:04:32.344
LIAM: All right, well friends,
we're about to descend

01:04:32.344 --> 01:04:33.213
into hell itself,

01:04:33.213 --> 01:04:35.453
so I reckon we should probably
pay the price.

01:04:35.453 --> 01:04:36.887
TALIESIN: Two moderates.

01:04:36.887 --> 01:04:38.650
MATT: Greater. In the new edition.

01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:39.681
TALIESIN: Greater.

01:04:39.681 --> 01:04:42.191
MARISHA: How much are the greaters?

01:04:42.191 --> 01:04:45.353
MATT: "The greater healing potions
run 300 gold apiece."

01:04:45.353 --> 01:04:46.451
LAURA: Oh, let's get a few of those.

01:04:46.451 --> 01:04:50.213
TRAVIS: I need like three of those.

01:04:50.213 --> 01:04:51.046
MATT: "So, three?"

01:04:51.046 --> 01:04:51.879
TRAVIS: Yeah, three.

01:04:51.879 --> 01:04:53.571
LAURA: Do you have any arrows that--

01:04:53.571 --> 01:04:55.602
TRAVIS: Well let's do the potions first.

01:04:55.602 --> 01:04:57.552
LAURA: Okay okay okay, two for me.

01:04:57.552 --> 01:04:58.735
MATT: "So, five."

01:04:58.735 --> 01:05:00.051
TALIESIN: Two for me as well.

01:05:00.051 --> 01:05:00.884
MATT: "Seven."

01:05:00.884 --> 01:05:01.717
TRAVIS: Keyleth.

01:05:01.717 --> 01:05:02.550
MARISHA: I'll take one.

01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:03.383
MATT: "Eight."

01:05:03.383 --> 01:05:04.216
TRAVIS: Tiberius?

01:05:04.216 --> 01:05:06.429
MATT: "Anyone else require a
moderate healing potion?"

01:05:06.429 --> 01:05:07.514
TRAVIS: Tiberius?

01:05:07.514 --> 01:05:08.734
ORION: I could take one.

01:05:08.734 --> 01:05:10.047
MATT: Pathfinder to 5E.

01:05:10.047 --> 01:05:10.880
TRAVIS: Scanlan?

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.462
SAM: Well, do we have ours leftover
from what we had before?

01:05:13.462 --> 01:05:15.218
[LAURA, TRAVIS, MATT] Yes.

01:05:15.218 --> 01:05:16.695
SAM: Then I'm fine.

01:05:16.695 --> 01:05:18.418
TRAVIS: Vax?
LAURA: He's Vax.

01:05:18.418 --> 01:05:20.690
LIAM: No, I'm good actually.
LAURA: He's Vax.

01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:22.519
TRAVIS: Oh, my intelligence is six.

01:05:22.519 --> 01:05:25.071
LIAM: I'm so fast I don't
really use them that much.

01:05:25.071 --> 01:05:25.903
TRAVIS: So nine.

01:05:25.903 --> 01:05:27.306
LIAM: You'll get to that point as well.

01:05:27.306 --> 01:05:28.343
LAURA: Nine potions then.

01:05:28.343 --> 01:05:30.488
TRAVIS: Nine times 300, work that out.

01:05:30.488 --> 01:05:33.950
MATT: As he pulls up his arcane calculator.

01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:35.806
LAURA: So 2500 for all nine then.

01:05:35.806 --> 01:05:38.063
TALIESIN: It's an abacus, God, abacus!

01:05:38.063 --> 01:05:41.068
TRAVIS: I believe it's 2700 gold pieces?

01:05:41.068 --> 01:05:42.966
LAURA: Why would you do that?

01:05:42.966 --> 01:05:43.799
I was trying to make him--

01:05:43.799 --> 01:05:45.540
MATT: "It is 27."

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:48.123
MATT: He says, "Impressive for a goliath.

01:05:50.472 --> 01:05:52.940
"I don't mean to assume,
but in my experiences,

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:54.193
"your kind is--

01:05:54.193 --> 01:05:57.238
TRAVIS: It's Professor Grog, actually.

01:05:57.238 --> 01:05:59.414
ORION: All right, calm down.

01:05:59.414 --> 01:06:03.437
MATT: "2700 gold pieces for your
nine greater healing potions."

01:06:03.437 --> 01:06:04.604
LAURA: All right, 27.

01:06:05.663 --> 01:06:07.009
Do you have any arrows

01:06:07.009 --> 01:06:10.092
that perhaps have magical properties?

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:13.041
ORION: Enchanted arrows is
what she's asking for.

01:06:13.041 --> 01:06:13.924
LAURA: Yes.

01:06:13.924 --> 01:06:16.473
MATT: He kind of glances over
his shoulder and says,

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:19.472
"Ah, we haven't had much a
request for arrows in a while.

01:06:19.472 --> 01:06:22.942
"We have bolts for crossbows,
as that seems to be the staple

01:06:22.942 --> 01:06:24.971
"for the carvers of the city.

01:06:24.971 --> 01:06:27.308
"I have two sleep arrows,
perhaps, if that is

01:06:27.308 --> 01:06:28.474
"of interest to you."

01:06:28.474 --> 01:06:29.732
ORION: Yes they would be, very much.

01:06:29.732 --> 01:06:32.694
LAURA: And what would you charge for those, sir?

01:06:34.861 --> 01:06:37.184
TALIESIN: Ooh, I should build
some interesting arrows.

01:06:37.184 --> 01:06:38.706
MARISHA: You should.

01:06:38.706 --> 01:06:39.751
MATT: Arrows.

01:06:39.751 --> 01:06:43.465
(whispering and muttering)

01:06:43.465 --> 01:06:47.216
MATT: "That would run you 250 gold per arrow.

01:06:47.216 --> 01:06:48.321
"I have two currently."

01:06:48.321 --> 01:06:50.005
LAURA: All right, all right, I'll take 'em.

01:06:50.005 --> 01:06:51.621
MATT: "All right, 500 gold.

01:06:51.621 --> 01:06:54.783
"With that, that is a
total of 3200 gold pieces."

01:06:54.783 --> 01:06:57.748
TRAVIS: Scanlan, underwater breathing
or air, oxygen supplies?

01:06:57.748 --> 01:07:00.388
ORION: Dear sir, have you happened upon any--

01:07:00.388 --> 01:07:01.541
TRAVIS: Ask with your fancy talk.

01:07:01.541 --> 01:07:03.458
ORION: --relic or artifact around here, or heard

01:07:03.458 --> 01:07:06.599
of something called the Pale Stone?

01:07:06.599 --> 01:07:08.703
LAURA: Sorry, you have to watch us buy things.

01:07:08.703 --> 01:07:11.649
ORION: This is a rare artifact
I've been looking for

01:07:11.649 --> 01:07:13.082
for quite some time.

01:07:13.082 --> 01:07:15.318
ORION: I figured an environment
like this might lend to something.

01:07:15.318 --> 01:07:16.831
LAURA: What is it a mess you've made?

01:07:16.831 --> 01:07:19.812
MATT: "I don't believe I have, but
should you come across one,

01:07:19.812 --> 01:07:21.996
"I would be interested to have a look."

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:23.285
ORION: Oh, you appraise?

01:07:23.285 --> 01:07:24.938
MATT: "If you don't mind."

01:07:24.938 --> 01:07:25.850
ORION: Very good.

01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:29.255
SAM: And do you have anything
for adventuring underwater

01:07:29.255 --> 01:07:33.315
or for helping to breathe in tight spaces?

01:07:33.315 --> 01:07:36.386
MATT: "Mm, potion of waterbreathing,
I do happen to have."

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:37.219
SAM: A potion of waterbreathing?

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:38.228
MATT: "Yes, I do."

01:07:38.228 --> 01:07:39.297
SAM: How much?

01:07:39.297 --> 01:07:40.891
MATT: "I have four of them available,

01:07:40.891 --> 01:07:42.610
"and they run 500 gold apiece."

01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:43.443
SAM: Jesus.

01:07:43.443 --> 01:07:44.443
TRAVIS: We'll take it.

01:07:44.443 --> 01:07:45.654
We got all this platinum I forgot about.

01:07:45.654 --> 01:07:46.993
SAM: Take one, two, one?

01:07:46.993 --> 01:07:48.398
LAURA: Don't say that!

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:49.669
TRAVIS: He can't hear--

01:07:49.669 --> 01:07:50.816
ORION: I don't need one.

01:07:50.816 --> 01:07:52.294
I bring out my bottle of air.

01:07:52.294 --> 01:07:53.535
And I go, "I have this."

01:07:53.535 --> 01:07:54.638
And I put it back in.

01:07:54.638 --> 01:07:55.471
SAM: I'm okay as well.

01:07:55.471 --> 01:07:56.783
You want one, Grog?

01:07:56.783 --> 01:07:57.616
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:07:57.616 --> 01:07:59.554
SAM: All right, we'll just take one of those.

01:07:59.554 --> 01:08:00.387
TRAVIS: Just one?

01:08:00.387 --> 01:08:02.040
SAM: Well, I don't need it.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:02.873
He doesn't need it.

01:08:02.873 --> 01:08:03.796
TRAVIS: We'll take two.

01:08:03.799 --> 01:08:04.632
SAM: Two.

01:08:04.632 --> 01:08:05.865
MATT: "1000 gold.

01:08:05.865 --> 01:08:07.439
"That brings us to 4200 gold."

01:08:07.439 --> 01:08:08.722
LAURA: Wait, 42?

01:08:08.722 --> 01:08:09.555
MATT: "Yes."

01:08:10.679 --> 01:08:14.488
LIAM: Have you any elven gear
for a son of Syngorn?

01:08:14.488 --> 01:08:16.325
LAURA: Are you taking it off of your pot now?

01:08:16.325 --> 01:08:17.078
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:08:17.432 --> 01:08:20.599
MATT: He gives you a keen look and goes,

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:23.345
"We don't get many requests for this,

01:08:23.345 --> 01:08:24.904
"but I think this may fit you."

01:08:24.904 --> 01:08:27.788
And he reaches below and
pulls up a fine piece

01:08:27.788 --> 01:08:30.058
of mithril chain, elven in make.

01:08:30.058 --> 01:08:31.511
LAURA: That's what I'm wearing.

01:08:31.511 --> 01:08:32.344
MATT: Mm hm.

01:08:32.344 --> 01:08:33.261
TRAVIS: Show-off.

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:38.848
MATT: He says, "Would you perhaps

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:40.655
"be interested in this elven chain?"

01:08:41.394 --> 01:08:42.810
LIAM: It's beautiful.

01:08:44.658 --> 01:08:47.408
I am a bit of a light-footed one.

01:08:48.658 --> 01:08:50.895
Would it suit me?

01:08:50.895 --> 01:08:52.060
MATT: "Hm.

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:54.267
"Chain does make a bit of a racket.

01:08:54.267 --> 01:08:56.684
"Might not recommend it, unfortunately."

01:08:56.684 --> 01:08:57.927
LIAM: All right.
I'll pass.

01:08:57.927 --> 01:08:59.618
TRAVIS: You couldn't buy it for me?

01:08:59.618 --> 01:09:01.139
LAURA: It won't fit you, it's for elves.

01:09:01.139 --> 01:09:02.156
LIAM: You're gigantic.

01:09:02.156 --> 01:09:04.411
TRAVIS: Could go on my pinky or something.

01:09:04.411 --> 01:09:05.852
LAURA: All right, cool.

01:09:05.852 --> 01:09:07.309
LIAM: Could fit on your left nut.

01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:08.119
LAURA: Well, thanks.

01:09:08.119 --> 01:09:10.122
TRAVIS: That's an important nut.

01:09:10.122 --> 01:09:11.635
MATT: He goes ahead and accepts your gold.

01:09:11.635 --> 01:09:13.118
Go ahead and mark off 4200 gold for those.

01:09:13.118 --> 01:09:14.076
LAURA: I did already.

01:09:14.076 --> 01:09:15.725
MATT: All right, very well.

01:09:15.725 --> 01:09:18.035
"Thank you for your patronage.

01:09:18.035 --> 01:09:19.984
"I look forward to
hopefully having you back

01:09:19.984 --> 01:09:24.638
"when you return with whatever
artifacts you manage to find."

01:09:24.638 --> 01:09:25.698
TRAVIS: Thank you, you're very nice.

01:09:25.698 --> 01:09:27.108
LAURA: Big expensive artifacts.

01:09:27.108 --> 01:09:28.378
TALIESIN: I say, you're one of
the most charming people

01:09:28.378 --> 01:09:29.894
we've met so far down here.

01:09:29.894 --> 01:09:31.265
TRAVIS: And it smells pretty in here.

01:09:31.265 --> 01:09:33.653
MATT: "Well of course, they
come in rare ordinance

01:09:33.653 --> 01:09:34.841
in this city, it seems."

01:09:34.841 --> 01:09:37.026
You hear under his breath
a little bit of a mutter.

01:09:37.026 --> 01:09:39.386
Apparently it's like elves
don't like dwarves, it's weird.

01:09:39.386 --> 01:09:42.072
TRAVIS: Do we sleep before we get to go kill shit?

01:09:42.072 --> 01:09:43.538
TALIESIN: We're gonna go sleep.

01:09:43.538 --> 01:09:44.571
TRAVIS: Well can we go do that?

01:09:44.571 --> 01:09:45.636
LAURA: Let's go sleep and then
get up in the morning

01:09:45.636 --> 01:09:47.131
and go down and kill things.

01:09:47.131 --> 01:09:48.179
TALIESIN: And I'd love to do a crafting roll

01:09:48.179 --> 01:09:49.626
right before I go to sleep

01:09:49.626 --> 01:09:51.495
just to put together a little thing.

01:09:51.495 --> 01:09:52.439
MATT: What would you like to put together?

01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:55.227
TALIESIN: I'd like to try and build a
bolo arrow, a trapping arrow.

01:09:55.227 --> 01:09:56.158
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:57.685
MATT: Interesting, okay.

01:09:57.685 --> 01:09:59.070
As you guys head back to the inn

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:00.765
where you've rented rooms for the week,

01:10:00.765 --> 01:10:02.413
TRAVIS: You clever fucker.

01:10:02.413 --> 01:10:05.536
MATT: Which would be at the Iron Hearth Tavern.

01:10:05.536 --> 01:10:06.610
TRAVIS: Is Ballsack in there?

01:10:06.610 --> 01:10:08.079
When we walk in?

01:10:08.079 --> 01:10:10.480
MATT: Balgus is not in the tavern, no.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:11.313
TRAVIS: He's not?

01:10:11.313 --> 01:10:13.396
ORION: He's Balgus, Grog.
MATT: No, sorry.

01:10:13.396 --> 01:10:14.341
TRAVIS: Really?

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:15.870
MATT: He's got a home.

01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:17.642
TRAVIS: Yeah, but doesn't mean
he have to go to it.

01:10:17.642 --> 01:10:18.621
MATT: True.

01:10:18.621 --> 01:10:20.329
LAURA: I walk Trinket down into the storage area

01:10:20.329 --> 01:10:21.162
that he can stay in.

01:10:21.162 --> 01:10:23.168
MATT: [bear noise] Trinket goes down begrudgingly.

01:10:23.168 --> 01:10:24.003
ORION: Damn it.

01:10:24.003 --> 01:10:25.979
LAURA: I look around for something that can

01:10:25.979 --> 01:10:28.229
look like a pillow for him.

01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:29.899
MATT: You find a couple of sacks of grain

01:10:29.899 --> 01:10:31.048
that can probably work.

01:10:31.048 --> 01:10:33.150
LAURA: I put them down and
make them comfy for him.

01:10:33.150 --> 01:10:34.810
MATT: Okay, you think they're probably
not gonna last the night

01:10:34.810 --> 01:10:36.103
with those bear claws.

01:10:36.103 --> 01:10:37.411
But you don't care, it's not your grain.

01:10:37.411 --> 01:10:38.578
LAURA: That's fine.

01:10:38.578 --> 01:10:40.319
Also, I feed him.

01:10:40.319 --> 01:10:44.062
MATT: Okay, Trinket is very happy.
(imitates bear eating)

01:10:44.062 --> 01:10:46.298
Tears into some meat.

01:10:46.298 --> 01:10:49.208
You guys make it back to the
tavern for an evening's rest.

01:10:49.208 --> 01:10:50.112
For you--

01:10:50.112 --> 01:10:52.718
TALIESIN: Not a super complicated thing,
but, you know, I've gotta--

01:10:52.718 --> 01:10:55.110
MATT: Go ahead and make a Tinker's Kit roll.

01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:57.269
TALIESIN: What am I rolling with my Tinker's Kit?

01:10:57.269 --> 01:10:58.705
I've never done this before.

01:10:58.705 --> 01:11:00.078
MATT: For this, I would go ahead

01:11:00.078 --> 01:11:02.143
and make it an intellect
modifier to your roll.

01:11:02.143 --> 01:11:03.791
TALIESIN: Intellect modifier?

01:11:03.791 --> 01:11:05.659
TRAVIS: Rock that shit, Perce.

01:11:05.659 --> 01:11:08.539
TALIESIN: And I'm spending my bonus die as well.

01:11:08.539 --> 01:11:09.907
LAURA: Oh, we have bonus die, don't we?

01:11:09.907 --> 01:11:10.875
From Scanlan.

01:11:10.875 --> 01:11:13.087
TALIESIN: Thank God, because I rolled really badly.

01:11:13.087 --> 01:11:14.649
10.

01:11:14.649 --> 01:11:15.482
MATT: 10?

01:11:16.405 --> 01:11:19.336
You spend and toil away for
the next four or so hours

01:11:19.336 --> 01:11:22.054
trying to find a way to
get this trigger to work.

01:11:22.054 --> 01:11:24.690
Twice you nearly sprain a finger.

01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:27.032
You manage seemingly get it to function,

01:11:27.032 --> 01:11:29.519
then the arrow itself splits and shatters.

01:11:29.519 --> 01:11:31.681
You can see there being something to it,

01:11:31.681 --> 01:11:33.784
but this night it's not
gonna come to you.

01:11:33.784 --> 01:11:35.659
TALIESIN: I'm gonna have to try again later.

01:11:35.659 --> 01:11:37.013
Okay, that's fine.
It's on the list.

01:11:37.013 --> 01:11:38.290
That was a terrible roll.

01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:39.583
MATT: It was a terrible roll.

01:11:39.583 --> 01:11:40.506
MARISHA: It's been a bad day for rolls.

01:11:40.506 --> 01:11:41.806
It's been bad day for rolling.

01:11:41.806 --> 01:11:42.662
LAURA: Fresh start in the morning.

01:11:42.662 --> 01:11:44.359
SAM: Well, tomorrow is the day that it counts,

01:11:44.359 --> 01:11:45.737
because that's when we
begin to crack some heads.

01:11:45.737 --> 01:11:47.059
LAURA: When we could die.

01:11:47.059 --> 01:11:48.537
TALIESIN: Out with this system, new dice.

01:11:48.537 --> 01:11:50.025
MARISHA: To be fair, it's been a long day.

01:11:50.025 --> 01:11:51.241
I'm still bleeding everywhere.

01:11:51.241 --> 01:11:52.372
SAM: Should we rest and get on with it?

01:11:52.372 --> 01:11:53.205
LAURA: Let's do it!

01:11:53.205 --> 01:11:54.954
SAM: Or should we visit some whorehouses?

01:11:54.954 --> 01:11:56.217
TRAVIS: Nah, let's sleep.

01:11:56.217 --> 01:11:57.730
SAM: Let's just sleep tonight.

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.461
LAURA: Just sleep and go.

01:11:59.461 --> 01:12:01.958
TRAVIS: Oh, they're still tired
from the other night.

01:12:01.958 --> 01:12:04.379
SAM: Oh yes, one of them battered me quite--

01:12:04.379 --> 01:12:05.938
TRAVIS: I don't know what this is.

01:12:05.938 --> 01:12:08.397
SAM: That's me getting beaten
up by a whore dwarf.

01:12:08.397 --> 01:12:10.577
TRAVIS: Oh, it's you getting the elbow drop.

01:12:10.577 --> 01:12:12.057
TRAVIS: She's giving you the Randy Savage

01:12:12.057 --> 01:12:13.474
from the bedpost.

01:12:14.393 --> 01:12:15.926
TRAVIS: Oh yeah!

01:12:15.926 --> 01:12:16.793
(crosstalk)

01:12:16.793 --> 01:12:17.699
TRAVIS: We're sleeping now.

01:12:17.699 --> 01:12:18.545
MATT: All right.

01:12:18.545 --> 01:12:19.692
So you guys go to sleep.

01:12:19.692 --> 01:12:23.671
Wake up the next morning
fully healed, spells restored,

01:12:23.671 --> 01:12:25.681
well rested and ready for the day.

01:12:25.681 --> 01:12:26.754
You think it's day.

01:12:26.754 --> 01:12:27.787
It's hard to tell.

01:12:27.787 --> 01:12:29.677
Still, this underground
circumstance is really

01:12:29.677 --> 01:12:30.909
messing with you guys.

01:12:30.909 --> 01:12:32.614
SAM: Well, should we go plunder some mines

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:33.498
and kill some goblins?

01:12:33.498 --> 01:12:34.625
LAURA: Let's do it.

01:12:34.625 --> 01:12:36.660
TALIESIN: Let's go plunder some mines.

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:38.590
TRAVIS: So we head down to the mines.

01:12:38.952 --> 01:12:39.785
MATT: All right.

01:12:39.785 --> 01:12:40.952
TRAVIS: To the hole.

01:12:40.952 --> 01:12:41.785
MATT: All right.

01:12:41.785 --> 01:12:43.390
TRAVIS: ♫ Takin' it to the hole ♫

01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:44.973
MATT: You make your way

01:12:44.973 --> 01:12:47.506
down to the bottom ring of Kraghammer.

01:12:47.506 --> 01:12:48.649
To the mines proper.

01:12:48.649 --> 01:12:50.495
The miners have gone back to work,

01:12:50.495 --> 01:12:52.556
and from what you can see,

01:12:52.556 --> 01:12:54.705
there's just an all around crazy business

01:12:54.705 --> 01:12:56.919
with people cleaning out, still trying

01:12:56.919 --> 01:12:59.495
to clean out the ichor
that's on the ground

01:12:59.495 --> 01:13:01.925
left over from the battle
you guys had the day before.

01:13:01.925 --> 01:13:03.742
You make your way 
to the front of the mines,

01:13:03.742 --> 01:13:06.327
and immediately three of the
carvers that are standing

01:13:06.327 --> 01:13:08.600
at the front approach
as you begin to walk,

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:11.297
and then upon noticing you, kind of like,

01:13:11.297 --> 01:13:13.471
step back and put their
weapons to the side.

01:13:13.471 --> 01:13:14.304
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:13:14.304 --> 01:13:16.255
MATT: Acknowledging the orders they received

01:13:16.255 --> 01:13:17.511
from Lord Greyspine.

01:13:17.511 --> 01:13:19.392
LAURA: Oh, Trinket's with us.

01:13:19.392 --> 01:13:20.524
MATT: Trinket has come along with you.

01:13:20.524 --> 01:13:22.019
SAM: Trinket the bear, Trinket the bear.

01:13:22.019 --> 01:13:24.169
LAURA: I just saw that, don't forget Trinket.

01:13:24.169 --> 01:13:25.422
I didn't forget Trinket.

01:13:25.422 --> 01:13:27.617
MATT: I assume Trinket comes with
you unless you say otherwise.

01:13:27.617 --> 01:13:28.560
MATT: In general.

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.510
TRAVIS: Are they especially bowing
to Scanlan the snake slayer?

01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:33.510
MATT: (laughs)

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:35.351
No.

01:13:35.351 --> 01:13:37.128
(group laughs)

01:13:37.128 --> 01:13:37.961
TRAVIS: No love!

01:13:37.961 --> 01:13:39.477
MATT: They're busy working.

01:13:40.938 --> 01:13:43.955
MATT: And fair play to the
gnome, but they're dwarves.

01:13:43.955 --> 01:13:44.788
SAM: Sure.

01:13:44.788 --> 01:13:45.682
ORION: Yeah.

01:13:45.682 --> 01:13:47.389
They see that crap all the time.

01:13:47.389 --> 01:13:50.913
MATT: You make your way into the mine proper.

01:13:50.913 --> 01:13:53.128
It goes back for a good
10 minutes of walking

01:13:53.128 --> 01:13:53.961
and of winding.

01:13:53.961 --> 01:13:55.434
You can see the actual track

01:13:55.434 --> 01:13:57.705
of the minetrack leading around.

01:13:57.705 --> 01:13:59.583
You come upon a couple
of dwarves that

01:13:59.583 --> 01:14:00.966
look over their shoulders
begrudgingly at you guys

01:14:00.966 --> 01:14:02.606
as you pass going, "Hey?

01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:05.337
Eh, shh," and go right back into
mining whatever remains

01:14:05.337 --> 01:14:06.583
in the inside of this.

01:14:06.583 --> 01:14:07.974
It looks like this portion of the mine

01:14:07.974 --> 01:14:09.704
has been nearly picked clean.

01:14:09.704 --> 01:14:11.812
The dwarves that are in there
are probably just wasting time

01:14:11.812 --> 01:14:13.901
to get their pay for the day.

01:14:13.901 --> 01:14:16.074
You go further back and
eventually it opens up.

01:14:16.074 --> 01:14:17.565
I think I have the map available.

01:14:17.565 --> 01:14:18.398
LIAM: I've got it right here.

01:14:18.398 --> 01:14:19.231
SAM: It's over there.

01:14:19.231 --> 01:14:20.154
MATT: Cool.

01:14:20.157 --> 01:14:22.119
SAM: Can you put it so that the people can see?

01:14:22.119 --> 01:14:23.252
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

01:14:23.252 --> 01:14:24.085
SAM: Is that a thing?

01:14:24.085 --> 01:14:25.234
TRAVIS: They can't see that.

01:14:25.234 --> 01:14:27.710
MATT: We can put it on there perhaps.

01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:29.707
For the most part I'll be
describing it as you go,

01:14:29.707 --> 01:14:30.723
so it's not too important.

01:14:30.723 --> 01:14:31.526
LAURA: Okay.

01:14:31.526 --> 01:14:32.779
TALIESIN: Looks like Italy.

01:14:32.779 --> 01:14:33.612
MATT: Yes.

01:14:33.612 --> 01:14:34.585
TRAVIS: It's a boot.

01:14:34.585 --> 01:14:36.044
MARISHA: It's the boot, yeah.

01:14:36.044 --> 01:14:38.410
MATT: Following it, you get
to a portion of the mine

01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:39.316
that is very busy.

01:14:39.316 --> 01:14:41.406
You can see, since this is
probably one of the portions

01:14:41.406 --> 01:14:44.220
that wasn't collapsed
in previous incursions

01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:46.693
buy whatever creatures these were,

01:14:46.693 --> 01:14:48.583
you get the feeling that
this one has basically taken

01:14:48.583 --> 01:14:51.291
most of their workforce to try and find

01:14:51.291 --> 01:14:53.041
and carve a new vein.

01:14:53.876 --> 01:14:55.809
Or find a new path to pull things from.

01:14:55.809 --> 01:14:58.891
You get towards the portion

01:14:58.891 --> 01:15:00.745
where all these dwarves are working,

01:15:00.745 --> 01:15:03.390
and you notice that some of
the doors have been shattered,

01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:04.563
knocked off the hinges.

01:15:04.563 --> 01:15:06.140
You imagine whatever creatures

01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:08.014
were barreling through before,

01:15:08.014 --> 01:15:10.297
this is probably where they came through.

01:15:10.297 --> 01:15:11.858
LAURA: All right.

01:15:11.858 --> 01:15:13.686
TALIESIN: That's where we're going.

01:15:13.686 --> 01:15:15.568
TRAVIS: Make an arcane check.
Somebody with arcane.

01:15:15.568 --> 01:15:17.447
LAURA: Oh yeah, can I look around?

01:15:17.447 --> 01:15:18.280
Perception.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.503
MATT: You look around.

01:15:19.503 --> 01:15:20.690
What are you looking for?

01:15:20.690 --> 01:15:22.286
LAURA: I'm looking for, you know.

01:15:22.286 --> 01:15:23.119
(group laughs)

01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:24.232
TRAVIS: Be specific.

01:15:24.232 --> 01:15:25.502
TALIESIN: 15 arcana check.

01:15:25.502 --> 01:15:26.946
LAURA: Scratch marks for anything.

01:15:26.946 --> 01:15:28.870
MARISHA: I like the idea of magic perception.

01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:31.773
TALIESIN: I just wanna see if
there's anything familiar

01:15:31.773 --> 01:15:35.690
about the markings,
if I can identify

01:15:36.009 --> 01:15:38.812
any signs of something mystical
that's come through here.

01:15:38.812 --> 01:15:41.050
TRAVIS: Like a portal or a prison or a--

01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:42.903
MATT: That'd be more of an investigation roll.

01:15:42.903 --> 01:15:44.047
TALIESIN: Oh, well, alright.

01:15:44.047 --> 01:15:45.916
LAURA: I'm gonna look for tracks.

01:15:45.916 --> 01:15:46.719
MATT: Okay.

01:15:46.719 --> 01:15:49.002
That'll be an investigation
roll for you as well.

01:15:49.002 --> 01:15:51.189
MARISHA: I'm gonna assist her,
look for animal tracks.

01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:52.335
LAURA: I'm scared, I don't
know which one to roll.

01:15:52.335 --> 01:15:53.625
Both my die have been rolling so bad.

01:15:53.625 --> 01:15:55.623
ORION: I want to detect magic for a while.

01:15:55.623 --> 01:15:56.897
MATT: All right.

01:15:56.897 --> 01:15:59.181
(loud thud)

01:15:59.181 --> 01:16:00.574
MATT: Aid roll, Keyleth?

01:16:00.574 --> 01:16:02.682
LAURA: This one is no longer in service.

01:16:03.098 --> 01:16:04.161
TALIESIN: Oh, wow!

01:16:04.161 --> 01:16:05.252
MARISHA: Five.

01:16:05.252 --> 01:16:06.832
TRAVIS: Well hers is a lot better.

01:16:06.832 --> 01:16:07.719
MARISHA: Good.

01:16:07.719 --> 01:16:10.293
LIAM: Sorry, I've got the map,
so I'm looking at the mine.

01:16:10.293 --> 01:16:12.229
Are we still in the dwarven carved out,

01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:14.799
sort of structure portion of the mine.

01:16:14.799 --> 01:16:15.632
MATT: You are.

01:16:15.632 --> 01:16:18.059
You have just essentially
started on that map.

01:16:19.252 --> 01:16:20.395
SAM: So let's go down.

01:16:20.395 --> 01:16:21.812
LIAM: Guys, I'm holding a map.

01:16:21.812 --> 01:16:25.315
I see one room that
they've scrawled "Supply" on,

01:16:25.315 --> 01:16:27.515
so it should be the next right up ahead.

01:16:27.515 --> 01:16:29.540
I'd like to just take a peek in there

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:32.513
and see what we can see
before we head deeper in.

01:16:32.513 --> 01:16:34.419
MATT: All right, you are--?

01:16:34.419 --> 01:16:36.302
LAURA: I rolled a one again.

01:16:36.302 --> 01:16:37.360
MATT: A natural one.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.021
LAURA: A natural one.

01:16:39.021 --> 01:16:42.525
Vax and I get dressed up
in Sherlock Holmes cosplay,

01:16:42.525 --> 01:16:45.323
and we say, "Golly gee, I
think I see some animal tracks

01:16:45.323 --> 01:16:46.706
"over here."

01:16:46.706 --> 01:16:48.353
TALIESIN: They are staring at their
own footprints on the ground.

01:16:48.353 --> 01:16:50.073
MARISHA: "The trail's going cold!"

01:16:50.073 --> 01:16:51.800
TALIESIN: Following around in a circle.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.661
MATT: Oh man, this has turned completely back

01:16:53.661 --> 01:16:55.105
from the first game.

01:16:55.105 --> 01:16:56.893
You guys are failing consistently.

01:16:56.893 --> 01:16:57.726
LAURA: Everything.

01:16:57.726 --> 01:17:00.009
MATT: Let's turn this around,
let's turn this around.

01:17:00.009 --> 01:17:02.296
LIAM: Anyhow, I've got a map, so let's use this.

01:17:02.296 --> 01:17:03.269
Stay on point here.

01:17:03.269 --> 01:17:06.017
MATT: You make your way 
towards the supply room as you

01:17:06.017 --> 01:17:07.217
head to where it was.

01:17:07.217 --> 01:17:08.561
One of the dwarves is guarding it.

01:17:08.561 --> 01:17:11.077
Not a carver, just one of
the miners that was hired

01:17:11.077 --> 01:17:12.962
for this purpose is standing there.

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:15.364
Leads you into the door,
kind of opening it for you,

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:18.934
awkwardly going, "All right,
whatever you're looking for, fine.

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:20.403
"Go inside."

01:17:20.403 --> 01:17:23.168
Looking inside, there are
just racks and racks and racks

01:17:23.168 --> 01:17:26.729
of pickaxes, shovels, utensils
for the purpose of mining

01:17:26.729 --> 01:17:27.699
and constructing.

01:17:27.699 --> 01:17:29.578
There are wooden boards lying down.

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:33.077
There are just giant barrels
of nails and clipping utensils,

01:17:33.077 --> 01:17:35.665
and things that are used
in the continuous expansion

01:17:35.665 --> 01:17:36.533
of a mine.

01:17:36.533 --> 01:17:37.789
LIAM: I've seen enough.

01:17:37.789 --> 01:17:38.952
We should keep going.

01:17:38.952 --> 01:17:41.057
(group laughs)

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.584
This map says that there's an elevator

01:17:43.584 --> 01:17:45.471
a short ways up.
LAURA: That goes down.

01:17:45.471 --> 01:17:46.304
LIAM: That goes down.

01:17:46.304 --> 01:17:48.968
But then there's a railway
that goes further in

01:17:48.968 --> 01:17:51.147
into the caves, so I'm not sure.

01:17:51.147 --> 01:17:53.230
LAURA: We should probably go down.

01:17:53.236 --> 01:17:55.320
MARISHA: Yeah, I feel like going down.
LIAM: Elevator straight down?

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.905
MARISHA: Let's go further, all the way down.

01:17:57.905 --> 01:17:59.956
SAM: How many of us can the elevator hold?

01:17:59.956 --> 01:18:02.441
MATT: Elevator can pretty much
hold all of you guys.

01:18:02.441 --> 01:18:03.617
SAM: Okay, let's go.

01:18:03.617 --> 01:18:05.125
LIAM: It's a safe assumption
that Lady Kima did not just

01:18:05.125 --> 01:18:06.912
walk to the back of the upper floors,

01:18:06.912 --> 01:18:07.777
she probably went down.

01:18:07.777 --> 01:18:08.610
SAM: Yeah, let's go down, come on!

01:18:08.610 --> 01:18:10.314
LIAM: Get shit done, let's go.

01:18:10.314 --> 01:18:11.147
MATT: All right.

01:18:11.147 --> 01:18:12.170
LAURA: Let's do it.

01:18:12.170 --> 01:18:13.003
MARISHA: Get low.

01:18:13.003 --> 01:18:14.219
TRAVIS: Air high five.

01:18:14.219 --> 01:18:15.952
LIAM: We have a map to the elevator.

01:18:15.952 --> 01:18:16.785
TRAVIS: Make 10.

01:18:16.785 --> 01:18:19.692
MATT: As you guys are walking over
to where the elevator is,

01:18:19.692 --> 01:18:21.982
you do notice there are
two places in the mines

01:18:21.982 --> 01:18:24.102
where there is just large piles of rubble.

01:18:24.102 --> 01:18:26.119
And part of the ceiling has collapsed.

01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:28.190
You can see that there were portions

01:18:28.190 --> 01:18:31.409
where the mine expanded much
deeper into the mountain

01:18:31.409 --> 01:18:34.544
that were detonated or
collapsed in the idea

01:18:34.544 --> 01:18:37.546
of preventing any further incursion by

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:41.296
whatever these creatures
are pouring through.

01:18:42.693 --> 01:18:45.349
You also can see that there
are some dwarven corpses

01:18:45.349 --> 01:18:47.437
being loaded out from the mine below,

01:18:47.437 --> 01:18:49.406
as well as goblin corpses,

01:18:49.406 --> 01:18:51.766
individuals that were caught in the attack

01:18:51.766 --> 01:18:53.966
that happened yesterday before it managed

01:18:53.966 --> 01:18:55.965
to emerge from the mine.

01:18:55.965 --> 01:18:58.789
LIAM: Scanlan, are you all right
around these goblin corpses?

01:18:58.789 --> 01:19:00.420
LAURA: We should follow those.

01:19:01.406 --> 01:19:05.451
SAM: Any goblin corpse is a good goblin, I say.

01:19:05.451 --> 01:19:06.422
I'm fine with it.

01:19:06.422 --> 01:19:08.246
I'll just quickly spit on their bodies

01:19:08.246 --> 01:19:09.281
as they go by.

01:19:09.281 --> 01:19:11.861
MATT: And you do so quite quickly (spits).

01:19:11.861 --> 01:19:13.334
It's rapid, it's amazing.

01:19:13.334 --> 01:19:14.901
LAURA: So we follow the corpses

01:19:14.901 --> 01:19:16.775
and see where they're coming from.

01:19:16.775 --> 01:19:20.099
MATT: All right. So that heads away 
from the elevator.

01:19:20.099 --> 01:19:21.740
SAM: No no no, no no no.

01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:23.851
That's being taken to be
buried, let's just keep--

01:19:23.851 --> 01:19:25.954
LAURA: No no no, where 
they're coming from.

01:19:25.954 --> 01:19:26.784
SAM: Oh.

01:19:26.784 --> 01:19:29.685
LIAM: So we could either go
to the rear of the mine

01:19:29.685 --> 01:19:32.048
on this level and see
where they're coming from.

01:19:32.048 --> 01:19:34.095
LAURA: I thought we already went downstairs?

01:19:34.095 --> 01:19:35.293
LIAM: No, not yet.

01:19:35.293 --> 01:19:37.732
MATT: There's a spiral staircase on the map.

01:19:37.732 --> 01:19:39.420
On the lower right hand side.

01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:40.586
LIAM: Yes, I see it.

01:19:40.586 --> 01:19:41.919
MATT: That's where they're coming from.

01:19:41.919 --> 01:19:42.752
LAURA: Does that lead down probably?

01:19:42.752 --> 01:19:43.822
MATT: It seems to.

01:19:43.822 --> 01:19:46.257
LAURA: Well then let's take
the elevator, whatever.

01:19:46.257 --> 01:19:47.430
Let's go down.

01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:48.605
MATT: All right.

01:19:48.605 --> 01:19:50.512
TRAVIS: You should put it under the thing.

01:19:50.512 --> 01:19:52.419
TALIESIN: We're good with down.

01:19:52.419 --> 01:19:54.786
MATT: You guys go ahead and
approach the elevator.

01:19:54.786 --> 01:19:58.097
It's a large wooden platform
with a series of chains.

01:19:58.097 --> 01:20:01.188
My terrible, hastily
drawn map there for you.

01:20:01.188 --> 01:20:02.988
TRAVIS: It's kinda crap, but it's kinda great.

01:20:02.988 --> 01:20:03.911
MATT: Yeah, I know.

01:20:03.911 --> 01:20:06.075
It was actually more
designed as a DM utensil,

01:20:06.075 --> 01:20:07.881
but you guys needed a map--

01:20:07.881 --> 01:20:08.714
TRAVIS: I love it.

01:20:08.714 --> 01:20:09.547
MATT: --so I gave you my map.

01:20:09.547 --> 01:20:11.751
TRAVIS: There you go.

01:20:11.751 --> 01:20:12.584
LAURA: Take it back.

01:20:12.584 --> 01:20:13.805
MATT: So I'm taking it back.

01:20:13.805 --> 01:20:14.763
(group laughs)

01:20:14.763 --> 01:20:15.596
ORION: Give it to me.

01:20:15.596 --> 01:20:16.469
MATT: It's-a mine.

01:20:16.469 --> 01:20:18.664
No, I'm keeping it.

01:20:18.664 --> 01:20:20.199
It's all right.

01:20:20.199 --> 01:20:22.310
So you get back to the elevator.

01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:27.227
There's a large 15 by 20
platform with a series of chains

01:20:27.227 --> 01:20:30.587
and there are two dwarves in the back

01:20:30.587 --> 01:20:33.249
that run a giant iron wheel.

01:20:33.249 --> 01:20:35.675
As you approach, they kind
of give you a look, like,

01:20:35.675 --> 01:20:37.901
"Well, are you serious about going down?"

01:20:37.901 --> 01:20:40.015
[Travis, Laura, and Marisha] Yeah.

01:20:40.015 --> 01:20:42.193
MATT: "Okay, step on the platform."

01:20:42.193 --> 01:20:43.356
LAURA: Let's do it.

01:20:43.356 --> 01:20:45.918
The two dwarves grab and begin
to rotate the giant wheel,

01:20:45.918 --> 01:20:48.725
as it does you here the winch
and the chain begin to tighten

01:20:48.725 --> 01:20:49.558
as it does.

01:20:49.558 --> 01:20:51.017
The platform shudders for a second,

01:20:51.017 --> 01:20:52.215
begins to lower.

01:20:52.215 --> 01:20:54.111
As it begins to lower, you
can feel the actual platform

01:20:54.111 --> 01:20:56.245
shake a little bit
as the whole weight

01:20:56.245 --> 01:20:57.078
is placed on the chains.

01:20:57.078 --> 01:20:58.413
TALIESIN: Guys. We're on an elevator.

01:20:58.413 --> 01:20:59.970
MARISHA: This is scary.

01:20:59.970 --> 01:21:01.278
ORION: I love elevators.

01:21:01.278 --> 01:21:02.610
MATT: As the winch begins to release, it--

01:21:02.610 --> 01:21:04.019
LAURA: I pet Trinket, calm him down.

01:21:04.019 --> 01:21:04.935
MARISHA: I've never been on 
one of these before.

01:21:04.935 --> 01:21:06.317
MATT: Trinket is a little nervous.

01:21:06.317 --> 01:21:07.420
MARISHA: It's really tight.

01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:09.523
TALIESIN: I'm on an elevator with a bear.

01:21:09.523 --> 01:21:11.310
MARISHA: It's really dark, tight.

01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:12.585
ORION: Oh, light! (snaps)

01:21:12.585 --> 01:21:13.933
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:21:13.933 --> 01:21:15.099
LAURA: Are we down yet?

01:21:15.099 --> 01:21:16.852
MARISHA: Keyleth's getting a little claustrophobic.

01:21:16.852 --> 01:21:18.797
She's never been in this tight of a space.

01:21:18.797 --> 01:21:20.460
TRAVIS: Are you claustrophobic?

01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:24.616
MATT: As the light spell bursts
out from his staff.

01:21:24.616 --> 01:21:28.855
You all kind of have to
cover your eyes for a second.

01:21:28.855 --> 01:21:30.841
But the lower area is opened up.

01:21:30.841 --> 01:21:32.356
LIAM: Word of warning, Tiberius.

01:21:32.356 --> 01:21:33.369
LAURA: Can we see out?

01:21:33.369 --> 01:21:35.745
ORION: She said it was dark,
and then I cast my spell.

01:21:35.745 --> 01:21:37.085
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's what you do.

01:21:37.085 --> 01:21:39.968
MATT: (imitates loud thudding) You
guys hit the bottom floor.

01:21:39.968 --> 01:21:41.433
You step off the platform, and you can see

01:21:41.433 --> 01:21:44.148
there is a secondary minecart
that leads from this elevator

01:21:44.148 --> 01:21:46.508
that curves to the left and leads deeper

01:21:46.508 --> 01:21:48.488
into the mine proper.

01:21:48.488 --> 01:21:50.754
To the right of you is
the spiral staircase.

01:21:50.754 --> 01:21:53.587
And you can see now two
of the other miner dwarves

01:21:53.587 --> 01:21:56.046
are dragging a dead body across.

01:21:56.046 --> 01:21:59.465
LAURA: Can I look for goblin tracks
down here and follow those?

01:21:59.465 --> 01:22:00.597
MATT: (laughs) You can attempt
another investigation check.

01:22:00.597 --> 01:22:02.774
SAM: Why don't we just ask the dwarves

01:22:02.774 --> 01:22:06.029
where they were getting the bodies?

01:22:06.029 --> 01:22:07.778
TRAVIS: You're gonna roll crap.
You're gonna roll crap.

01:22:07.778 --> 01:22:08.983
LAURA: Don't curse me.

01:22:08.983 --> 01:22:11.602
MARISHA: Please don't do that.

01:22:11.602 --> 01:22:13.890
LAURA: What am I, what is it?
That I add it to?

01:22:13.890 --> 01:22:14.799
MATT: Investigate.

01:22:14.799 --> 01:22:15.732
LAURA: Perception?

01:22:15.732 --> 01:22:16.825
MATT: Investigate.

01:22:16.825 --> 01:22:18.738
But you advantage on the roll,
because you're a ranger, tracking.

01:22:18.738 --> 01:22:19.819
LAURA: Oh sweet.
Okay.

01:22:19.822 --> 01:22:21.303
SAM: Why don't we just ask?

01:22:21.303 --> 01:22:22.481
LAURA: Well that's good, okay.

01:22:22.481 --> 01:22:24.263
Let's go with a 17.

01:22:24.263 --> 01:22:25.430
MATT: 17, alright.

01:22:27.248 --> 01:22:29.994
So as you guys are going
to ask somebody about this,

01:22:29.994 --> 01:22:32.565
your ranger gets down and
begins inspecting the floor.

01:22:32.565 --> 01:22:34.073
LAURA: Yeah, I see things!

01:22:34.073 --> 01:22:35.910
MATT: Where you can see there were struggles

01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:37.093
that apparently occurred.

01:22:37.093 --> 01:22:38.920
You can see slash marks on the ground.

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:41.004
You can see bodies, or
the impacts of bodies

01:22:41.004 --> 01:22:44.639
where some of these dwarves
have been pulled away.

01:22:44.639 --> 01:22:47.489
A few minutes later, you can see tracks,

01:22:47.489 --> 01:22:51.552
dwarven tracks, of bodies
being pulled and dragged,

01:22:51.552 --> 01:22:54.237
not in the direction they're going,

01:22:54.237 --> 01:22:56.496
but further down the tunnel.

01:22:56.496 --> 01:22:58.292
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go there.

01:22:58.292 --> 01:22:59.790
LAURA: Oh, no.

01:22:59.790 --> 01:23:01.776
MATT: As you look and follow that track,

01:23:01.776 --> 01:23:03.670
you notice that maybe a good 200 feet

01:23:03.670 --> 01:23:06.486
to the left of the cavern,
there is a new tunnel breach

01:23:06.486 --> 01:23:07.654
that is currently open.

01:23:07.654 --> 01:23:10.801
About a 20 by 15 size tunnel
that is fresh and blasted out

01:23:10.801 --> 01:23:11.838
from the other side.

01:23:11.838 --> 01:23:14.415
You can see rubble and rocks
strewn across the floor.

01:23:14.415 --> 01:23:16.358
LAURA: I hear, I hear birds coming from the--

01:23:16.358 --> 01:23:17.671
TRAVIS: It's a fucking trip, right?

01:23:17.671 --> 01:23:18.572
LAURA: I know.

01:23:18.572 --> 01:23:19.865
SAM: Let's go down there.

01:23:19.865 --> 01:23:21.565
Let's go down where it's dangerous.

01:23:21.565 --> 01:23:22.398
MATT: All right.

01:23:22.398 --> 01:23:23.401
LAURA: Can we see?

01:23:23.401 --> 01:23:24.580
TRAVIS: Can we ask one of the guards?

01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:25.803
TALIESIN: It's a mine canary.

01:23:25.803 --> 01:23:27.176
LIAM: Is it black or is it dim?

01:23:27.176 --> 01:23:28.868
MATT: With his light spell, it's fairly bright.

01:23:28.868 --> 01:23:29.901
TRAVIS: Nice!

01:23:29.901 --> 01:23:31.512
MATT: Otherwise, it's fairly dim.

01:23:31.512 --> 01:23:35.033
TRAVIS: I cup my hands over my face
and go, Grog, Grog, Grog. (laughs)

01:23:37.291 --> 01:23:38.630
MATT: And it does echo.

01:23:38.630 --> 01:23:40.883
Grog, Grog, Grog, Grog.

01:23:40.883 --> 01:23:42.346
LAURA: Why would you do that?

01:23:42.346 --> 01:23:43.170
TRAVIS: Why not?

01:23:43.170 --> 01:23:44.003
MATT: (faintly) Grog-Grog. Grog.

01:23:45.866 --> 01:23:49.027
Following the tracks,
you can see the dragging

01:23:49.027 --> 01:23:52.689
of the bodies does indeed
go in the direction,

01:23:52.689 --> 01:23:55.171
and into the newly carved tunnel.

01:23:55.171 --> 01:23:56.171
In this mine network.

01:23:56.171 --> 01:23:57.456
LAURA: All right.

01:23:59.199 --> 01:24:01.394
MATT: What you do notice is the dwarves' bodies

01:24:01.394 --> 01:24:03.049
that are being dragged away:

01:24:03.049 --> 01:24:05.187
you can see footprints
of those that are also

01:24:05.187 --> 01:24:06.147
pulling them aside.

01:24:06.147 --> 01:24:08.583
You kind of figure out the
idea of the pattern

01:24:08.583 --> 01:24:09.583
of the footsteps that are
leading in that direction.

01:24:09.583 --> 01:24:11.116
LAURA: Big, small?

01:24:11.116 --> 01:24:13.044
MATT: Most of them are also dwarven in shape.

01:24:13.044 --> 01:24:13.937
LAURA: Oh, okay.

01:24:13.937 --> 01:24:15.150
MARISHA: Most of them.

01:24:15.150 --> 01:24:18.271
MATT: So, there are, you can gather,

01:24:18.271 --> 01:24:20.760
dwarven feet dragging
dwarven bodies deeper inside.

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:21.563
LIAM: Duergar.

01:24:21.563 --> 01:24:22.939
LAURA: Dwarven centipede.

01:24:22.939 --> 01:24:24.035
LIAM: It's the duergar.

01:24:24.035 --> 01:24:27.160
MATT: However, there are two
bodies that are being dragged

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.067
with no footprints whatsoever.

01:24:29.067 --> 01:24:29.982
TRAVIS: What?

01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:30.775
LAURA: Wings.

01:24:30.775 --> 01:24:32.626
SAM: They're being used like skateboards.

01:24:32.626 --> 01:24:35.105
(group laughs)

01:24:35.105 --> 01:24:36.621
MARISHA: Legolas style.

01:24:36.621 --> 01:24:38.664
ORION: Who and what are those?

01:24:38.664 --> 01:24:39.914
LIAM: This is 2015.

01:24:42.043 --> 01:24:43.341
TRAVIS: Is there any residue?

01:24:43.341 --> 01:24:44.174
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:24:44.174 --> 01:24:46.060
SAM: Wow, if only we had asked some dwarves

01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:47.843
what's been going on down here.

01:24:47.843 --> 01:24:49.870
LAURA: Is there any residue, blood?

01:24:49.870 --> 01:24:51.124
ORION: We already know.

01:24:51.124 --> 01:24:52.577
LAURA: Green, red, black.

01:24:52.577 --> 01:24:56.327
MATT: From the dragging marks,
there is no blood.

01:24:57.595 --> 01:25:00.696
There's no signs of them dragging
dead bodies off, at least.

01:25:00.696 --> 01:25:02.766
LAURA: Does it look like they struggled?

01:25:02.766 --> 01:25:04.676
MATT: No, there's no struggle either.

01:25:04.676 --> 01:25:05.882
TRAVIS: Oh crap, fire.

01:25:05.882 --> 01:25:06.992
MARISHA: What about the walls?

01:25:06.992 --> 01:25:08.521
How close are the walls?

01:25:08.521 --> 01:25:10.600
MATT: The walls here for this tunnel are

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:12.190
about 15, 20 feet in width.

01:25:14.063 --> 01:25:15.798
And about 10, 15 feet high.

01:25:15.798 --> 01:25:18.774
MARISHA: Are there any scratch
marks or anything like that

01:25:18.774 --> 01:25:20.178
on the walls?

01:25:20.178 --> 01:25:21.658
MATT: No.

01:25:21.658 --> 01:25:23.800
LIAM: Let's stop dicking around
and go into that mine.

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:26.076
TRAVIS, TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: Might as well.

01:25:26.482 --> 01:25:27.510
MATT: All right.

01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:28.570
TRAVIS: We go further.

01:25:28.570 --> 01:25:30.020
MATT: You push further in.

01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:31.922
(Liam imitates sword being drawn)

01:25:31.922 --> 01:25:34.840
MATT: So, this tunnel, pitch black.

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.100
There's no light source aside from the one

01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:37.331
that you're creating.

01:25:37.331 --> 01:25:39.580
You guys push forward.

01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:41.539
And push forward, following the tracks.

01:25:41.539 --> 01:25:43.074
And push forward.

01:25:43.074 --> 01:25:47.277
And the the tunnel winds
and winds and descends.

01:25:47.277 --> 01:25:49.194
And winds and descends.

01:25:50.462 --> 01:25:52.351
About two hours--

01:25:52.351 --> 01:25:54.214
[Laura, Marisha, Travis, and Sam] What?!

01:25:54.214 --> 01:25:56.749
MATT: --of following this tunnel
with little variation.

01:25:56.749 --> 01:25:58.322
LAURA: Should've grabbed some dried fruit.

01:25:58.322 --> 01:25:59.155
TRAVIS: We got a ton.

01:25:59.155 --> 01:26:03.082
MATT: Steadily declining and
winding as it progresses.

01:26:03.082 --> 01:26:04.760
Three hours go by.

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.728
This tunnel goes extremely deep.

01:26:06.728 --> 01:26:08.916
Whatever managed to dig its way up here

01:26:08.916 --> 01:26:11.583
came from pretty far under this mine.

01:26:11.583 --> 01:26:14.685
LAURA: At no point does it look
like the bodies ever moved?

01:26:14.685 --> 01:26:16.713
MATT: Nope, no change in physicality.

01:26:16.713 --> 01:26:18.175
No sign of struggle.

01:26:18.175 --> 01:26:20.542
MARISHA: But there are the drag marks all the way?
MATT: Yeah.

01:26:20.542 --> 01:26:22.465
LIAM: And two hours ago, 
I started stealthing

01:26:22.465 --> 01:26:23.799
and taking the lead.

01:26:23.799 --> 01:26:24.984
When we're in the dark.

01:26:24.984 --> 01:26:27.394
MATT: All right, go ahead
and roll a stealth check.

01:26:27.394 --> 01:26:29.174
LAURA: I thought I was tracking.

01:26:33.081 --> 01:26:33.914
LIAM: Uh, 29.

01:26:33.914 --> 01:26:35.626
LAURA: Whoo, that's a good roll.

01:26:35.626 --> 01:26:37.360
Yay, first good roll of the night.

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:38.501
MATT: All right, there we go.

01:26:38.501 --> 01:26:39.894
Your luck is changing now.

01:26:39.894 --> 01:26:41.237
LAURA: Changing it around.

01:26:41.237 --> 01:26:42.620
TRAVIS: Let me touch you.

01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:43.906
MATT: You feel pretty stealthy.

01:26:43.906 --> 01:26:47.817
You guys look like, wait,
where the hell did Vax go?

01:26:47.817 --> 01:26:50.780
MARISHA: Oh shit, I hope he didn't hear
me just say that about him.

01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:51.710
Dammit.

01:26:51.710 --> 01:26:53.162
LAURA: Oh thank you, brother.

01:26:53.162 --> 01:26:55.178
TALIESIN: I'm having a serious
Tom Sawyer island vibe.

01:26:55.178 --> 01:26:56.271
LAURA: I found him.

01:26:56.271 --> 01:26:57.067
LIAM: Looks fine.

01:26:57.067 --> 01:26:58.243
MATT: About four hours--

01:26:58.243 --> 01:27:00.004
MARISHA: Are there any drafts?

01:27:00.004 --> 01:27:01.909
Do I feel any wind flows
or anything like that?

01:27:01.909 --> 01:27:02.803
MATT: No.

01:27:02.803 --> 01:27:03.769
It is still.

01:27:03.769 --> 01:27:05.714
It is stagnant air.

01:27:05.714 --> 01:27:06.547
(Laura coughs)

01:27:06.547 --> 01:27:08.464
Even more stagnant now.

01:27:09.554 --> 01:27:13.721
Four hours of traveling
deeper into this tunnel's path

01:27:15.056 --> 01:27:16.472
until--

01:27:16.472 --> 01:27:18.487
LAURA: Anybody else have to go 
to the bathroom?

01:27:18.487 --> 01:27:20.020
TRAVIS: He rolled, he rolled something.

01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:20.890
LAURA: Oh no, he rolled.

01:27:20.890 --> 01:27:25.097
MARISHA: And so, that is how I
spent my 12th birthday.

01:27:25.097 --> 01:27:26.423
SAM: Great story, Keyleth.

01:27:26.423 --> 01:27:27.256
And, yeah.

01:27:27.256 --> 01:27:28.815
MARISHA: Let's see, what else.

01:27:28.815 --> 01:27:30.930
TRAVIS: Hey Scanlan, you kill me, I kill you.

01:27:30.930 --> 01:27:34.030
LIAM: There a great little cave alcove here,

01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:35.233
perfect for peeing in.

01:27:35.233 --> 01:27:37.083
LAURA: Oh brother, good to see you.

01:27:37.083 --> 01:27:38.678
LIAM: For everyone to pee.

01:27:38.678 --> 01:27:41.511
LAURA: Am I over here, or am I over here?

01:27:42.793 --> 01:27:45.067
Perhaps we could take a pee break here

01:27:45.067 --> 01:27:46.770
and proceed further into the mines.

01:27:46.770 --> 01:27:48.183
MARISHA: I agree with that.

01:27:48.183 --> 01:27:49.631
LAURA: That's a good idea.

01:27:49.631 --> 01:27:51.044
LIAM: Do you catch my drift?

01:27:51.044 --> 01:27:52.771
MATT: As the four hour mark of travel

01:27:52.771 --> 01:27:55.346
into this tunnel presents itself,

01:27:55.346 --> 01:27:58.346
the tunnel finally widens and opens.

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.262
As the sound of distant water
rushing reaches your ears.

01:28:03.262 --> 01:28:06.429
LAURA: Oh no, I have to go to the bathroom.

01:28:07.748 --> 01:28:10.915
MATT: As Tiberius steps into this opening,

01:28:11.796 --> 01:28:15.129
the light cascades into this new cavern.

01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:21.862
A large, beautiful open
space presents itself,

01:28:21.862 --> 01:28:24.112
a good 100-foot-up ceiling.

01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:28.176
From what you can see,
a roaring river is now

01:28:28.176 --> 01:28:31.616
pouring out of the nearby rock,
cascading over a cliffside

01:28:31.616 --> 01:28:34.849
into a waterfall down into this deeper,

01:28:34.849 --> 01:28:36.547
giant cavernous space.

01:28:36.547 --> 01:28:38.136
LAURA: What about the tracks?

01:28:38.136 --> 01:28:41.915
MATT: The tracks continue in the
direction of that river.

01:28:41.915 --> 01:28:43.223
MARISHA: Into the river?

01:28:43.223 --> 01:28:46.135
Like it goes into the water?

01:28:46.135 --> 01:28:48.635
LAURA: Do we want to step 
into the room fully?

01:28:48.635 --> 01:28:50.238
MARISHA: Why don't we send--

01:28:50.238 --> 01:28:52.621
LAURA: I'm gonna stealth.
I'm gonna stealth, too.

01:28:52.621 --> 01:28:53.911
MARISHA: Stealth twins.

01:28:53.911 --> 01:28:55.492
ORION: Do I detect any magic?

01:28:55.492 --> 01:28:58.120
Stealth twins, 2015.

01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.953
MATT: You detect no magic.

01:28:59.953 --> 01:29:00.893
You roll stealth.

01:29:00.893 --> 01:29:01.691
LAURA: 17.

01:29:01.691 --> 01:29:03.924
MATT: Let's go ahead and take a bio break--

01:29:03.924 --> 01:29:04.757
LAURA: Okay.

01:29:05.695 --> 01:29:07.387
MATT: --as the mystery begins to unveil.

01:29:07.387 --> 01:29:09.613
(group laughs)

01:29:09.613 --> 01:29:10.446
ORION: I love a mystery.

01:29:10.446 --> 01:29:12.748
MATT: Be back here in about
five, ten minutes, folks.

01:29:12.748 --> 01:29:14.094
So keep an ear out.

01:29:14.094 --> 01:29:15.844
TRAVIS: Quick, quick break.

01:29:16.791 --> 01:29:18.364
ORION: I'm gonna pee my face off.

01:29:18.364 --> 01:29:19.939
(Liam imitates rushing water)

01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:22.112
MATT: We'll be right back.

01:29:22.112 --> 01:29:23.228
ORION: Enjoy our butt shots, everybody.

01:29:23.228 --> 01:29:26.221
MATT: And everyone runs off to
take care of their business.

01:29:27.364 --> 01:29:29.029
TRAVIS: Right, listen up.

01:29:29.029 --> 01:29:32.556
If you have ale, then you have
a friend in Grog Strongjaw.

01:29:33.795 --> 01:29:37.409
A goliath of towering height and size,

01:29:37.409 --> 01:29:39.659
this barbarian has an
appetite for the two--

01:29:39.659 --> 01:29:41.264
[audio resets]

01:29:41.264 --> 01:29:43.340
TRAVIS: Right, listen up.

01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:46.355
If you have ale, then you have
a friend in Grog Strongjaw.

01:29:48.537 --> 01:29:51.973
A goliath of towering height and size,

01:29:51.973 --> 01:29:54.960
this barbarian has an appetite for the two

01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:58.960
great loves in his life:
combat, women, and ale.

01:30:00.751 --> 01:30:02.008
(record scratches)

01:30:02.008 --> 01:30:03.330
Wait.

01:30:03.330 --> 01:30:07.007
Easily the brains of the
group, Grog is often consulted

01:30:07.007 --> 01:30:11.174
for his vast knowledge of
shapes, colors, and shiny things.

01:30:13.422 --> 01:30:14.932
Also ale.

01:30:14.932 --> 01:30:18.789
In his early years, armed
with his two-handed great axe,

01:30:18.789 --> 01:30:21.703
Grog often enjoyed proving
his might amongst the ranks

01:30:21.703 --> 01:30:24.746
of his family's wandering herd.

01:30:24.746 --> 01:30:27.764
But after coming upon an
unsuspecting, elderly gnome

01:30:27.764 --> 01:30:30.269
in the woods, he objected to the killing

01:30:30.269 --> 01:30:32.352
of such an innocent life.

01:30:33.409 --> 01:30:36.774
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity

01:30:36.774 --> 01:30:39.921
for this, this terrified little thing.

01:30:39.921 --> 01:30:51.701
[no audio]

01:30:51.701 --> 01:30:53.229
TRAVIS: Right, listen up.

01:30:53.229 --> 01:30:57.396
If you have ale, then you have
a friend in Grog Strongjaw.

01:30:58.783 --> 01:31:02.186
A goliath of towering height and size,

01:31:02.186 --> 01:31:06.271
this barbarian has an appetite
for the two great loves

01:31:06.271 --> 01:31:09.271
in his life: combat, women, and ale.

01:31:11.072 --> 01:31:12.134
(record scratching)

01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:13.042
Wait.

01:31:13.522 --> 01:31:17.453
Easily the brains of the
group, Grog is often consulted

01:31:17.453 --> 01:31:21.620
for his vast knowledge of
shapes, colors, and shiny things.

01:31:23.338 --> 01:31:24.171
Also ale.

01:31:25.293 --> 01:31:29.097
In his early years, armed
with his two-handed great axe,

01:31:29.097 --> 01:31:32.101
Grog often enjoyed proving
his might amongst the ranks

01:31:32.101 --> 01:31:34.514
of his family's wandering herd.

01:31:34.514 --> 01:31:38.010
But after coming upon an
unsuspecting elderly gnome

01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:40.572
in the woods, he objected to the killing

01:31:40.572 --> 01:31:42.655
of such an innocent life.

01:31:43.508 --> 01:31:47.093
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity

01:31:47.093 --> 01:31:50.260
for this, this terrified little thing.

01:31:51.833 --> 01:31:55.026
His disobedience cost him dearly.

01:31:55.026 --> 01:31:58.270
Beaten bloody and banished
by the herd leader,

01:31:58.270 --> 01:32:02.437
his uncle Kevdak, Grog was
abandoned and left to die.

01:32:03.521 --> 01:32:07.182
Exiled from his herd, it
was then that the relative

01:32:07.182 --> 01:32:11.099
of the very gnome he
fought to save, saved him.

01:32:12.209 --> 01:32:15.179
It was the kindness of a
gnome cleric named Pike

01:32:15.179 --> 01:32:19.647
that healed Grog, bringing
him back from death's edge.

01:32:19.647 --> 01:32:23.375
And they have remained
close friends ever since.

01:32:23.375 --> 01:32:27.085
Most nights, Grog can be found
challenging entire taverns

01:32:27.085 --> 01:32:28.920
to wrestling matches.

01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:32.026
Or accompanying Scanlan
to the nearest house

01:32:32.026 --> 01:32:34.526
where you pay for lady favors.

01:32:36.044 --> 01:32:36.877
Also ale.

01:32:38.393 --> 01:32:40.301
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth

01:32:40.301 --> 01:32:42.360
would leave you with little information

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:44.324
on the half-elven druid.

01:32:44.324 --> 01:32:46.657
You might even think that
her social awkwardness

01:32:46.657 --> 01:32:50.258
due to her sheltered
upbringing is kind of sweet.

01:32:50.258 --> 01:32:53.589
Of course, it would be
unwise to underestimate her

01:32:53.589 --> 01:32:55.154
based on first impressions.

01:32:55.154 --> 01:32:56.777
(lightning roars)

01:32:56.777 --> 01:32:58.808
Under that unintimidating petite frame

01:32:58.808 --> 01:33:01.587
is a vicious beast
waiting to be unleashed,

01:33:01.587 --> 01:33:04.182
whose natural powers have
made even the fiercest

01:33:04.182 --> 01:33:06.629
of champions pee their pants.

01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:07.462
Literally.

01:33:08.537 --> 01:33:11.014
Born to the air tribe
of the Ashari people,

01:33:11.014 --> 01:33:13.793
Keyleth was raised with
a deep love of nature

01:33:13.793 --> 01:33:15.830
and the elemental magics.

01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:17.496
It is her people's inherent duty

01:33:17.496 --> 01:33:20.258
to protect the delicate
areas in Tal'Dorei,

01:33:20.258 --> 01:33:22.650
where the four elemental
planes begin to bleed

01:33:22.650 --> 01:33:24.644
with this realm.

01:33:24.644 --> 01:33:26.786
Since she was a little
girl, she had quite a knack

01:33:26.786 --> 01:33:29.833
for air manipulation and
beast shaping abilities.

01:33:29.833 --> 01:33:33.151
Well, if you consider
kittens and flying squirrels

01:33:33.151 --> 01:33:35.818
to be little beasts, which I do.

01:33:37.129 --> 01:33:39.287
Anyways, it wasn't long
before the headmaster

01:33:39.287 --> 01:33:41.930
of the tribe, her father, Kohren,

01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:43.926
realized her true prodigious abilities

01:33:43.926 --> 01:33:46.157
and she was inveterated to succeed him

01:33:46.157 --> 01:33:48.769
as the next headmaster.

01:33:48.769 --> 01:33:51.628
Just like that, her jovial
childhood was stripped

01:33:51.628 --> 01:33:54.342
and replaced with endless
spell memorization,

01:33:54.342 --> 01:33:56.053
teachings from ancient traditions,

01:33:56.053 --> 01:33:58.880
and exceedingly high expectations.

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:00.684
Every druid leader-to-be must embark

01:34:00.684 --> 01:34:02.956
on a journey to seek out the sister tribes

01:34:02.956 --> 01:34:05.362
in order to introduce
and establish respect

01:34:05.362 --> 01:34:07.963
amongst the fellow headmasters.

01:34:07.963 --> 01:34:12.092
They call this the
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey.

01:34:12.092 --> 01:34:14.668
When her father felt she was
ready, he set her on the path

01:34:14.668 --> 01:34:16.986
to truly discovering herself.

01:34:16.986 --> 01:34:20.749
Not knowing when, or if,
she will ever return.

01:34:20.749 --> 01:34:23.112
As she hikes down the
mountain towards Stillben,

01:34:23.112 --> 01:34:25.761
she meditated on the task ahead.

01:34:25.761 --> 01:34:28.998
Part of the Aramente is proving
yourself a strong warrior,

01:34:28.998 --> 01:34:33.437
a valiant protector, and a
wise and compassionate leader.

01:34:33.437 --> 01:34:36.538
With this knowledge, one
thought plays in repeat

01:34:36.538 --> 01:34:37.538
in her mind:

01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:40.963
Is she even worthy?

01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:45.915
TALIESIN: Percy was the third
child of seven children,

01:34:45.915 --> 01:34:48.226
born to a noble family
who lived far to the north

01:34:48.226 --> 01:34:50.882
in the ancient castle of Whitestone.

01:34:50.882 --> 01:34:53.415
With so many siblings to
share the burdens of lordship,

01:34:53.415 --> 01:34:56.708
Percy turned his attention
to the sciences, engineering,

01:34:56.708 --> 01:34:58.496
and naturalism.

01:34:58.496 --> 01:35:02.384
One day, a mysterious couple
named Lord and Lady Briarwood

01:35:02.384 --> 01:35:04.046
came to court.

01:35:04.046 --> 01:35:06.378
During a feast held in
their honor, the Briarwoods

01:35:06.378 --> 01:35:09.438
violently took control of the castle,

01:35:09.438 --> 01:35:11.130
killing or imprisoning
everyone who would stand

01:35:11.130 --> 01:35:12.988
in their way.

01:35:12.988 --> 01:35:14.887
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon,

01:35:14.887 --> 01:35:17.636
only to be freed by his younger sister.

01:35:17.636 --> 01:35:20.737
Together they fled, chased
by the Briarwoods' men.

01:35:20.737 --> 01:35:23.965
As they ran, Percy's
sister took several arrows

01:35:23.965 --> 01:35:26.362
to the chest and fell.

01:35:26.362 --> 01:35:29.185
Percy kept running, eventually
jumping into a freezing river

01:35:29.185 --> 01:35:32.189
and floating unconscious to freedom.

01:35:32.189 --> 01:35:34.548
He did not remember waking
up on a fishing boat.

01:35:34.548 --> 01:35:37.170
He barely remembered the next two years,

01:35:37.170 --> 01:35:40.767
as he slowly made his way
as far south as possible.

01:35:40.767 --> 01:35:43.607
Then one night, Percy had a dream.

01:35:43.607 --> 01:35:46.504
A roaring cloud of smoke
offered him vengeance

01:35:46.504 --> 01:35:49.229
against those who destroyed his family.

01:35:49.229 --> 01:35:53.611
When he awoke, Percy began
to design his first gun.

01:35:53.611 --> 01:35:55.491
(gun cocking)

01:35:55.491 --> 01:35:57.040
(gun firing)

01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:59.690
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard
of Scanlan Shorthalt?

01:35:59.690 --> 01:36:01.585
Well, gird your loins, ladies,

01:36:01.585 --> 01:36:03.523
because he has his eye on you.

01:36:03.523 --> 01:36:06.088
A talented musician, master of disguise,

01:36:06.088 --> 01:36:08.177
and dashingly handsome in his own mind,

01:36:08.177 --> 01:36:10.638
Scanlan sings songs almost as much

01:36:10.638 --> 01:36:13.033
as he sings his own praises.

01:36:13.033 --> 01:36:16.295
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan
used his endless charm

01:36:16.295 --> 01:36:18.794
and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin

01:36:18.794 --> 01:36:21.021
and support his single mother.

01:36:21.021 --> 01:36:23.267
One day he was discovered
by a half-orc promoter

01:36:23.267 --> 01:36:27.675
and joined Dr. Dranzel's
Spectacular Traveling Troupe,

01:36:27.675 --> 01:36:29.671
where he learned the ways of the world

01:36:29.671 --> 01:36:33.608
and honed his skills as
a bard extraordinaire.

01:36:33.608 --> 01:36:36.227
A loner much of his life,
Scanlan has never quite come

01:36:36.227 --> 01:36:38.328
to terms with the violent
death of his mother

01:36:38.328 --> 01:36:40.449
at the hands of a goblin invasion.

01:36:40.449 --> 01:36:42.669
While his years on the road provided many,

01:36:42.669 --> 01:36:46.404
shall we say, educational
experiences with the opposite sex,

01:36:46.404 --> 01:36:49.741
deep down Scanlan yearns for
the one thing he's never known:

01:36:50.969 --> 01:36:53.636
the true love of a fellow gnome.

01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:57.902
Still, Scanlan considers
himself a lover first,

01:36:57.902 --> 01:37:01.154
performer second, and
fighter distant third.

01:37:01.154 --> 01:37:03.323
On the battlefield,
he'll support his allies

01:37:03.323 --> 01:37:06.244
but rarely draws blood unless it's

01:37:06.244 --> 01:37:08.695
to protect fellow gnome Pike.

01:37:08.695 --> 01:37:11.976
Count on Scanlan for a hearty
laugh, a rollicking song,

01:37:11.976 --> 01:37:14.433
and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

01:37:14.433 --> 01:37:16.766
and makes the females swoon.

01:37:18.430 --> 01:37:21.211
ORION: (clears throat)
Greetings and salutations.

01:37:21.211 --> 01:37:23.810
I am Tiberius Stormwind.

01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:26.736
I hail from a town called
Ty'rex, located in the heart

01:37:26.736 --> 01:37:30.347
of Draconia, from a
politically respected family.

01:37:30.347 --> 01:37:32.088
At the age of 15, I succeeded

01:37:32.088 --> 01:37:35.119
in passing the Sorcerer's Rite,
showing prodigy-like control

01:37:35.119 --> 01:37:35.952
of my magic.

01:37:35.952 --> 01:37:38.450
The judges and the Draconian
high council were amazed

01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:40.480
at how powerful my spells were

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:42.578
for how long I had been training.

01:37:42.578 --> 01:37:44.886
At 20 years old, I was the
youngest appointed member

01:37:44.886 --> 01:37:47.540
of the magic guild in Draconian history.

01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:50.069
For the next few years, I
almost went mad from the malaise

01:37:50.069 --> 01:37:53.986
of being a guild member,
as it's rather boring.

01:37:53.986 --> 01:37:56.329
However, one day I
happened upon a chamber,

01:37:56.329 --> 01:37:58.333
unused for quite some time.

01:37:58.333 --> 01:38:00.793
In the room were stacks of books and maps

01:38:00.793 --> 01:38:03.811
of the surrounding cities and
areas around the known world.

01:38:03.811 --> 01:38:06.280
For months I would frequent the chamber

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:08.148
and learned of artifacts from legend.

01:38:08.148 --> 01:38:10.959
After a long period of research,
I made a list of artifacts

01:38:10.959 --> 01:38:12.571
that caught my eye.

01:38:12.571 --> 01:38:14.773
I brought these findings
to the high council

01:38:14.773 --> 01:38:17.464
and was told that all of the
information in the chamber

01:38:17.464 --> 01:38:20.160
I stumbled upon was either
believed to be fiction

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:23.770
or unsolvable mysteries and
hence were lost forever.

01:38:23.770 --> 01:38:26.647
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

01:38:26.647 --> 01:38:28.824
A year later I devised a ruse and managed

01:38:28.824 --> 01:38:31.250
to convince the city council
to lend support in me

01:38:31.250 --> 01:38:33.746
leaving Draconia on a mission
of peace and diplomacy

01:38:33.746 --> 01:38:35.609
for the surrounding kingdoms.

01:38:35.609 --> 01:38:38.027
Going from town to town and
making friends and allies,

01:38:38.027 --> 01:38:39.912
in and for the name of Draconia.

01:38:39.912 --> 01:38:43.577
Being a red dragonborn, I had
quite the task on my hands

01:38:43.577 --> 01:38:46.460
in that respect, but it
was exactly what I needed,

01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:49.210
so I could explore the world
and find these artifacts,

01:38:49.210 --> 01:38:52.102
as I felt the truth was out there.

01:38:52.102 --> 01:38:53.977
Some may describe me as buffoonish,

01:38:53.977 --> 01:38:56.789
but I say poppycock to
all that. (stammers)

01:38:56.789 --> 01:38:59.091
I am much sharper than
most give me credit for.

01:38:59.091 --> 01:39:02.348
I just don't pay attention
to things sometimes.

01:39:02.348 --> 01:39:05.261
I've also been known to
be rather cunning, loyal,

01:39:05.261 --> 01:39:08.261
happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous.

01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:12.518
I can't help but show my true
scales every now and then.

01:39:12.518 --> 01:39:17.512
But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn.

01:39:17.512 --> 01:39:19.665
LIAM: Never entirely
welcome in the company

01:39:19.665 --> 01:39:22.326
of elves or men, Vax'ildan
learned at a young age

01:39:22.326 --> 01:39:25.388
to skip past formality, preferring instead

01:39:25.388 --> 01:39:28.100
to invite himself in your door.

01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:30.705
Along with twin sister
Vex'ahlia, Vax was born

01:39:30.705 --> 01:39:33.442
by a chance encounter
between elven royalty

01:39:33.442 --> 01:39:35.628
and human peasantry.

01:39:35.628 --> 01:39:38.391
Raised by their mother in
their early years, the twins

01:39:38.391 --> 01:39:40.417
were eventually sent off to their father

01:39:40.417 --> 01:39:42.613
in the elven capital of Syngorn.

01:39:42.613 --> 01:39:45.889
But their cool reception among
the elves there never warmed,

01:39:45.889 --> 01:39:48.871
and their time in the capital didn't last.

01:39:48.871 --> 01:39:51.086
The siblings stole away one autumn night

01:39:51.086 --> 01:39:53.785
and set out on the open road.

01:39:53.785 --> 01:39:56.051
After a few years of
wandering, they eventually

01:39:56.051 --> 01:39:58.044
decided to return to their mother

01:39:58.044 --> 01:40:00.594
and journeyed back to
the lands of their youth.

01:40:00.594 --> 01:40:03.235
But instead of finding
their childhood home,

01:40:03.235 --> 01:40:06.350
they returned to a pile of rubble.

01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:09.875
Their mother was gone,
their home burned to ash.

01:40:09.875 --> 01:40:12.363
Pressing the townspeople for answers,

01:40:12.363 --> 01:40:15.696
they learned of the day the dragon came.

01:40:18.807 --> 01:40:22.494
With their ties all severed,
Vax'ildan and his sister

01:40:22.494 --> 01:40:25.455
set out to find their fortune
together in Tal'Dorei.

01:40:25.455 --> 01:40:28.826
An outsider since birth,
Vax quickly learned

01:40:28.826 --> 01:40:32.958
to solve life's challenges
in his own particular way,

01:40:32.958 --> 01:40:35.822
often by sidestepping them entirely.

01:40:35.822 --> 01:40:39.549
And when his knack for circumventing
adversity isn't enough--

01:40:39.549 --> 01:40:41.233
(sword slicing)

01:40:41.233 --> 01:40:43.915
--the way of blades the
elves schooled him in

01:40:43.915 --> 01:40:46.649
more than makes up the difference.

01:40:46.649 --> 01:40:49.220
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia

01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:51.961
has spent most of her life
suffering the cool reception

01:40:51.961 --> 01:40:55.465
of a people who don't fully accept her.

01:40:55.465 --> 01:40:58.885
Born of a human mother
and an elven father,

01:40:58.885 --> 01:41:01.750
who only later in life took an
interest in their existence,

01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:04.888
Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan

01:41:04.888 --> 01:41:08.711
quickly realized the only
people they could truly rely on

01:41:08.711 --> 01:41:11.211
in this world were each other.

01:41:12.325 --> 01:41:14.374
It was at the age of ten
when the two were taken

01:41:14.374 --> 01:41:17.163
from their mother and
brought to live in Syngorn,

01:41:17.163 --> 01:41:19.877
the isolated elven city
for which their father

01:41:19.877 --> 01:41:21.779
was an ambassador.

01:41:21.779 --> 01:41:25.810
He quietly took them in but
always kept an icy distance,

01:41:25.810 --> 01:41:28.771
and after too many years
of disdainful looks,

01:41:28.771 --> 01:41:32.078
the pair decided to leave
his indifference behind

01:41:32.078 --> 01:41:34.707
and set out on their own.

01:41:34.707 --> 01:41:38.174
Vax took to the cities,
stealing small trinkets

01:41:38.174 --> 01:41:40.771
and learning the ways of the thief,

01:41:40.771 --> 01:41:43.434
while Vex kept to the woods.

01:41:43.434 --> 01:41:46.012
She preferred the isolation.

01:41:46.012 --> 01:41:48.242
Always the keen observer, she learned

01:41:48.242 --> 01:41:52.430
to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot.

01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:55.234
And through a series of fateful events,

01:41:55.234 --> 01:41:58.822
earned herself a companion
in the form of a bear,

01:41:58.822 --> 01:42:01.414
her own stolen Trinket,

01:42:01.414 --> 01:42:05.223
to fight alongside her
and protect her fiercely.

01:42:05.223 --> 01:42:09.140
Also, he is adorable and
gives expert massages.

01:42:10.367 --> 01:42:11.740
PRODUCER: And back to you.

01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:12.904
Welcome back.

01:42:12.904 --> 01:42:13.954
Thank you for waiting.

01:42:13.954 --> 01:42:15.938
We've all had our fill of snacks, drinks,

01:42:15.938 --> 01:42:18.848
and relieving ourselves of
the ones we had earlier.

01:42:18.848 --> 01:42:22.787
So, before we return, we
actually want to thank you guys

01:42:22.787 --> 01:42:24.667
for having all the subscriptions you have.

01:42:24.667 --> 01:42:26.388
Since we started playing, we
hit a thousand very quickly.

01:42:26.388 --> 01:42:27.313
You guys are awesome.

01:42:27.313 --> 01:42:28.146
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:42:28.146 --> 01:42:28.979
So thank you for that.

01:42:28.979 --> 01:42:29.812
Big round of applause.

01:42:29.812 --> 01:42:31.108
TRAVIS: Round of applause.

01:42:31.108 --> 01:42:32.234
Subscriptions have been awesome.

01:42:32.234 --> 01:42:35.224
And as such, we have a winner
for these evening's event.

01:42:35.224 --> 01:42:36.180
Hi, Tiberius.

01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:37.026
ORION: Sorry everyone.

01:42:37.026 --> 01:42:39.510
Tiberius has returned.

01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:41.760
So, in character as always.

01:42:44.738 --> 01:42:46.137
So, the winner of the
evening is going to win

01:42:46.137 --> 01:42:49.239
both a signed photo of
the cast of Critical Role

01:42:49.239 --> 01:42:52.571
as well as a signed Player's
Handbook of D&amp;amp;D's 5th Edition

01:42:52.571 --> 01:42:56.037
is: (clears throat)

01:42:56.037 --> 01:42:57.138
SAM: Visitor.

01:42:57.138 --> 01:42:59.620
(group laughs)

01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:01.912
No, on the backside.

01:43:01.912 --> 01:43:03.912
The winner is Yareth.

01:43:05.639 --> 01:43:06.521
Congratulations.

01:43:06.521 --> 01:43:08.501
Thank you for subscribing
and paying attention

01:43:08.501 --> 01:43:10.179
and being in the chatroom
and being awesome.

01:43:10.179 --> 01:43:11.157
We're gonna go ahead and
get your information,

01:43:11.157 --> 01:43:12.417
and we're gonna make sure that you

01:43:12.417 --> 01:43:14.678
get our awesome first
Critical Role giveaway.

01:43:14.678 --> 01:43:15.991
(group cheers and claps)

01:43:15.991 --> 01:43:18.058
Well done, Yareth.
Thank you for coming.

01:43:18.058 --> 01:43:18.891
MARISHA: Yareth.

01:43:18.891 --> 01:43:21.139
(group repeats Yalreth in funny voices)

01:43:21.139 --> 01:43:21.972
MATT: All right.

01:43:21.972 --> 01:43:23.285
(Marisha speaks gibberish)

01:43:23.285 --> 01:43:25.253
LIAM: Enjoy your Player's Handbook 5E.

01:43:25.253 --> 01:43:28.589
MATT: (laughs) Hopefully more
to come down the road.

01:43:28.589 --> 01:43:30.311
We'll have more fun things for you guys.

01:43:30.311 --> 01:43:31.672
So, anyway.

01:43:31.672 --> 01:43:34.518
So, bringing it back to the game at hand.

01:43:34.518 --> 01:43:37.235
As you've stepped into this
large, cavernous space,

01:43:37.235 --> 01:43:41.402
you can hear the rush of water
as the underground river

01:43:41.402 --> 01:43:44.396
begins to turn into a waterfall and drifts

01:43:44.396 --> 01:43:46.516
into a smaller body of water.

01:43:46.516 --> 01:43:48.954
It's just out of sight
beyond this cliff face.

01:43:48.954 --> 01:43:51.441
Into this open, cavernous area.

01:43:51.441 --> 01:43:53.069
LAURA: Oh, we just stealthed.

01:43:53.069 --> 01:43:56.406
MATT: You guys also stealthed, and
what did you roll for stealth?

01:43:56.406 --> 01:43:57.742
LAURA: I rolled 17.

01:43:57.742 --> 01:43:59.246
MATT: 17, got it.
All right.

01:43:59.246 --> 01:44:00.690
LIAM: Oh, less than that.

01:44:00.690 --> 01:44:01.763
LAURA: You didn't.

01:44:01.763 --> 01:44:03.516
LIAM: Oh, no I didn't, 18.

01:44:03.516 --> 01:44:04.349
MATT: All right.

01:44:04.349 --> 01:44:06.592
LAURA: You were already stealthed, though.

01:44:06.592 --> 01:44:07.759
LIAM: That's true.

01:44:08.331 --> 01:44:11.402
MATT: As you guys step into this space,

01:44:11.402 --> 01:44:14.152
there are sections of large rock,

01:44:15.347 --> 01:44:17.292
portions of stone that just jut out

01:44:17.292 --> 01:44:19.762
and block off portions
from your view of this area.

01:44:19.762 --> 01:44:21.725
Giant stalagmites and stalactites that

01:44:21.725 --> 01:44:23.995
just permeate the entirety of this cavern,

01:44:23.995 --> 01:44:26.965
which has been long, just
building and building

01:44:26.965 --> 01:44:30.396
with elements drawn from the ceiling,

01:44:30.396 --> 01:44:32.250
from the waters that flow through.

01:44:32.250 --> 01:44:34.233
You also faintly see a light source--

01:44:34.233 --> 01:44:35.456
LAURA: (whispers) Oh no.

01:44:35.456 --> 01:44:38.186
MATT: --behind one of those rock
pillars in the distance.

01:44:38.186 --> 01:44:39.658
LAURA: (whispers) Should we go 
check it out?

01:44:39.658 --> 01:44:41.466
LIAM: Do we perceive anything in here with us

01:44:41.466 --> 01:44:43.009
before going that far in, yes?

01:44:43.009 --> 01:44:45.176
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:44:47.177 --> 01:44:48.457
LIAM: 18.

01:44:48.457 --> 01:44:49.290
MATT: 18?

01:44:49.290 --> 01:44:50.688
LIAM: Yes.

01:44:50.688 --> 01:44:54.120
MATT: You hear a very, very faint
sound in the distance.

01:44:55.130 --> 01:44:56.199
(sharp noise)

01:44:56.199 --> 01:44:57.269
SAM: Jesus.

01:44:57.269 --> 01:44:58.339
(laughing)

01:44:58.339 --> 01:45:00.172
ORION: Did you hear that?

01:45:00.172 --> 01:45:02.262
MATT: That's not the sound.

01:45:02.262 --> 01:45:03.411
Tiberius.

01:45:03.411 --> 01:45:04.543
ORION: I'm sorry.

01:45:04.543 --> 01:45:06.959
LAURA: I have a passive perception of 21.

01:45:06.959 --> 01:45:08.420
MATT: Yes you do.

01:45:10.476 --> 01:45:11.476
You hear a:

01:45:12.106 --> 01:45:13.796
(clicks tongue quickly)

01:45:13.796 --> 01:45:14.838
LAURA: Oh, no.

01:45:14.838 --> 01:45:15.838
SAM: A skittering.

01:45:15.838 --> 01:45:17.275
MATT: (continues clicking)

01:45:17.275 --> 01:45:19.889
LIAM: I might hear spiders.

01:45:19.889 --> 01:45:20.772
MARISHA: Oh.

01:45:20.772 --> 01:45:21.677
LAURA: Ugh.

01:45:21.677 --> 01:45:22.582
TRAVIS: Or crab.

01:45:22.582 --> 01:45:23.547
LIAM: Or something.

01:45:23.547 --> 01:45:25.386
MARISHA: Making it old school.

01:45:25.386 --> 01:45:29.286
SAM: Maybe it's a very faint
maraca dance of some sort.

01:45:29.286 --> 01:45:30.866
LAURA: What direction is it coming from?

01:45:30.866 --> 01:45:31.969
TRAVIS: That would be better.

01:45:31.969 --> 01:45:33.661
MATT: It's hard to tell at this
point, it seems to be

01:45:33.661 --> 01:45:36.411
just kind of loosely atmospheric.

01:45:37.431 --> 01:45:39.732
TRAVIS: Is the light coming from over the water?

01:45:39.732 --> 01:45:42.104
MATT: The very, very faint 
light you see, no.

01:45:42.104 --> 01:45:44.320
It's adjacent to the
water to the right of you.

01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:45.170
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:45:45.170 --> 01:45:46.793
LIAM: I think we're dealing with spiders.

01:45:46.793 --> 01:45:47.947
MATT: (continues clicking)

01:45:47.947 --> 01:45:49.281
LAURA: I think you guys should hang back,

01:45:49.281 --> 01:45:51.826
and we should stealth over
and see how many it looks like

01:45:51.826 --> 01:45:52.760
we're dealing with.

01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:54.452
LIAM: The twins will creep forward.

01:45:54.452 --> 01:45:56.297
MATT: Okay. You both creep forward.

01:45:56.297 --> 01:45:58.890
LAURA: Trinket stays with the group.
Trinket, stay with Grog.

01:45:58.890 --> 01:46:00.623
ORION: I'm gonna dispel my light spell.

01:46:00.623 --> 01:46:04.224
MATT: Pitch darkness falls upon all of you.

01:46:04.224 --> 01:46:05.687
TRAVIS: What did you do that for?

01:46:05.687 --> 01:46:07.830
SAM: Because now they don't know 
where we are.

01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:09.193
LAURA: But we can't see anything.

01:46:09.194 --> 01:46:10.377
TRAVIS: They're spiders.

01:46:10.377 --> 01:46:11.816
MARISHA: While he does that,

01:46:11.816 --> 01:46:14.430
I'm gonna go ahead and
turn into a cave bear.

01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:15.927
ORION: Can you not see now?

01:46:15.927 --> 01:46:17.527
LAURA: We can see in dim light.

01:46:17.527 --> 01:46:19.514
MARISHA: Cave bears have darkvision.

01:46:19.514 --> 01:46:20.887
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure.

01:46:20.887 --> 01:46:22.139
LIAM: No, dim light only.

01:46:22.139 --> 01:46:23.072
MATT: Do they?

01:46:23.072 --> 01:46:24.605
LAURA: What'd you turn into?

01:46:24.605 --> 01:46:27.373
ORION: It doesn't matter, do you
want me to turn it back on?

01:46:27.373 --> 01:46:28.439
TALIESIN: A cave bear.

01:46:28.439 --> 01:46:31.268
MARISHA: Yeah, subterranean bears,
they have darkvision.

01:46:31.268 --> 01:46:32.601
MATT: All right. So.

01:46:32.601 --> 01:46:33.870
SAM: He can just make light again.

01:46:33.870 --> 01:46:35.303
MATT: Go ahead and roll a perception check.

01:46:35.303 --> 01:46:36.489
LIAM: Turn it back on.

01:46:36.489 --> 01:46:37.802
MARISHA: No, leave it off!

01:46:37.802 --> 01:46:39.575
ORION: I dispel it again, I'm sorry.

01:46:39.575 --> 01:46:40.818
MARISHA: Fuck! Fuck!

01:46:40.818 --> 01:46:42.992
MATT: Light, light light, light light.

01:46:42.992 --> 01:46:44.349
TALIESIN: How did you do that?

01:46:44.355 --> 01:46:45.939
MARISHA: It's been a bad night.

01:46:45.939 --> 01:46:47.065
LAURA: Oh no.

01:46:47.065 --> 01:46:47.996
MARISHA: 12 total.

01:46:47.996 --> 01:46:51.188
LIAM: Clap on (claps), clap off. (claps)

01:46:51.188 --> 01:46:53.875
MATT: As you glance about in cave bear form,

01:46:53.875 --> 01:46:58.089
you look up and all you can
make out is shifting movement

01:46:58.089 --> 01:46:59.540
across the ceiling.

01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:01.880
(group groans at once)

01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:03.130
MATT: But it's large.

01:47:04.502 --> 01:47:06.442
It's not a small creature.

01:47:07.706 --> 01:47:09.877
You glance off to your
left and you look up

01:47:09.877 --> 01:47:11.197
and you see a second one.

01:47:11.197 --> 01:47:12.897
LAURA: Oh no.
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.

01:47:12.897 --> 01:47:14.445
MATT: And both dislodge.

01:47:14.445 --> 01:47:15.278
LAURA: Oh no!

01:47:15.278 --> 01:47:17.916
MATT: All of you hear two 
loud, cacophonous,

01:47:17.916 --> 01:47:20.358
thunderous slam sounds--
(imitates loud thudding)

01:47:20.358 --> 01:47:22.064
LAURA: Definitely hit light now.

01:47:22.064 --> 01:47:24.697
MATT: --on the ground next to you--
(screeching noise)

01:47:24.697 --> 01:47:26.717
LIAM: I quickly whisper to my
sister, to the boundaries.

01:47:26.717 --> 01:47:28.683
MARISHA: And I just go: (roaring noise)

01:47:28.683 --> 01:47:29.516
ORION: Light!

01:47:29.516 --> 01:47:30.751
MATT: All right.

01:47:30.751 --> 01:47:33.348
LIAM: Vex and Vax dance backwards
against the walls.

01:47:33.348 --> 01:47:34.925
MATT: There is a surprise round.

01:47:34.925 --> 01:47:35.758
LAURA: Oh, no.

01:47:35.758 --> 01:47:36.864
(group groans)

01:47:36.864 --> 01:47:38.123
TRAVIS: Oh God.

01:47:38.123 --> 01:47:39.343
LIAM: But I heard them.

01:47:39.343 --> 01:47:42.156
MARISHA: I know. 
(roars)

01:47:42.156 --> 01:47:44.048
LAURA: Transform back.

01:47:44.048 --> 01:47:45.542
MATT: All right.

01:47:45.542 --> 01:47:47.955
So you guys are stealthed
off to the side there.

01:47:47.955 --> 01:47:49.763
LIAM: That's beautiful.

01:47:49.763 --> 01:47:51.163
LAURA: I'm on the other side.

01:47:51.163 --> 01:47:52.689
LIAM: Look at that fun map.

01:47:52.689 --> 01:47:53.868
MATT: There's Trinket.

01:47:53.868 --> 01:47:55.629
LIAM: Thank you, Matt, 
for doing all the work

01:47:55.629 --> 01:47:56.781
on these maps and shit.

01:47:56.781 --> 01:47:58.069
MATT: That's what I do.

01:47:58.069 --> 01:48:00.719
So there's the water there,
rushing off into the waterfall

01:48:00.719 --> 01:48:01.964
that goes further down.

01:48:01.964 --> 01:48:03.422
LAURA: Can I stealth
against the other wall?

01:48:03.422 --> 01:48:05.514
TRAVIS: Waterfall is where on that map?

01:48:05.514 --> 01:48:06.904
MATT: The waterfall is right here.

01:48:06.904 --> 01:48:07.737
TRAVIS: Got it.

01:48:07.737 --> 01:48:10.975
MATT: So the river kind of pours over,
falls into the water below.

01:48:10.975 --> 01:48:14.625
There are some of these
large rock elements here.

01:48:14.625 --> 01:48:15.739
SAM: What are they?

01:48:15.739 --> 01:48:18.118
MATT: You cannot tell what's 
beyond this area,

01:48:18.118 --> 01:48:20.845
which is where the light
source is coming from.

01:48:24.098 --> 01:48:25.251
(imitates thudding)

01:48:25.251 --> 01:48:26.822
LAURA: Oh no!
(group groans)

01:48:26.822 --> 01:48:27.858
(imitates thudding)

01:48:27.858 --> 01:48:29.707
TRAVIS: Those look like umber hulks.

01:48:29.707 --> 01:48:30.520
MATT: They are.

01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:32.373
(group screams)

01:48:32.373 --> 01:48:34.864
You've had one brief run-in
with a single umber hulk

01:48:34.864 --> 01:48:35.689
in the past.

01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:36.922
LAURA: Now we have two.

01:48:36.922 --> 01:48:38.858
As two slam into the ground beside you,

01:48:38.858 --> 01:48:40.750
dropping from the ceiling portion.

01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:41.692
LAURA: Fudge!

01:48:41.692 --> 01:48:42.827
TRAVIS: I have their claws still.

01:48:42.827 --> 01:48:44.278
LAURA: Wait, do you guys remember--

01:48:44.278 --> 01:48:45.478
(Matt growls and snarls)

01:48:45.478 --> 01:48:46.614
LAURA: Do they respond to vibration?

01:48:46.614 --> 01:48:48.435
ORION: I cast stoneskin
on myself immediately.

01:48:48.435 --> 01:48:50.649
You don't have that much
time, unfortunately.

01:48:50.649 --> 01:48:53.164
Because they are upon
you, it a surprise round.

01:48:53.164 --> 01:48:54.300
TRAVIS: Shit!

01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:56.021
LAURA: Do they respond to vibration?

01:48:56.021 --> 01:48:56.925
I forget.

01:48:56.925 --> 01:48:58.890
TRAVIS: They responded to something.

01:48:58.890 --> 01:49:01.044
MATT: They respond to the something.

01:49:01.044 --> 01:49:03.482
LAURA: Can we remember with
investigation or insight?

01:49:03.482 --> 01:49:05.550
LIAM: Limericks, limericks,
they respond to limericks.

01:49:05.550 --> 01:49:07.609
MATT: So this one shifts up over there,

01:49:07.609 --> 01:49:10.316
and this one moves up to there.

01:49:10.316 --> 01:49:12.425
Gleans past you, as it
does not notice you.

01:49:12.425 --> 01:49:14.184
LAURA: Yeah, but it's still big.

01:49:14.184 --> 01:49:16.354
MATT: This one comes towards you, Percy.

01:49:16.354 --> 01:49:17.467
TALIESIN: Damn it.

01:49:17.467 --> 01:49:19.786
MATT: Attacking you with each of its
claws and its mandibles.

01:49:19.786 --> 01:49:22.363
The first strike comes
at you with a 13 to hit

01:49:22.363 --> 01:49:23.903
with its first claw.

01:49:23.903 --> 01:49:24.736
What's your AC?

01:49:24.736 --> 01:49:25.784
TALIESIN: Ah, 17.

01:49:25.784 --> 01:49:28.339
MATT: You, woomf, just manage
to dodge out of the way

01:49:28.339 --> 01:49:30.948
as these giant-bladed claws
sweep next to your face.

01:49:31.248 --> 01:49:32.881
The second strike comes to you at a 21.

01:49:32.881 --> 01:49:34.227
TRAVIS: Oh shit.
That hits.

01:49:34.227 --> 01:49:35.380
TALIESIN: That hits.

01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:38.713
I'm going to use a gunslinger's dodge.

01:49:40.146 --> 01:49:41.549
LAURA: Gunslinger's dodge.

01:49:41.549 --> 01:49:43.595
TALIESIN: Wait, let's see if I can do this.

01:49:43.595 --> 01:49:45.109
It's not enough, nevermind, so no.

01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:46.772
I just gotta take it.

01:49:46.772 --> 01:49:50.378
MATT: All right, so the claw finds
purchase across your torso.

01:49:50.378 --> 01:49:52.626
(imitates claw slicing) 
The armor catches most of it.

01:49:52.626 --> 01:49:56.072
However, the slash does
leave an impact on you,

01:49:56.072 --> 01:49:58.207
as you can feel the taste of iron

01:49:58.207 --> 01:49:59.614
in the back of your throat.

01:49:59.614 --> 01:50:01.737
You suffer nine points of slashing damage.

01:50:01.737 --> 01:50:02.703
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

01:50:02.703 --> 01:50:04.641
MATT: And just as you pull back 
the mandibles,

01:50:04.641 --> 01:50:05.825
time to crunch down upon you.

01:50:05.825 --> 01:50:08.327
And that is going to be a 27 to hit.

01:50:08.327 --> 01:50:09.683
LAURA: Oh, no.

01:50:09.683 --> 01:50:10.997
TRAVIS: Do their eyes do something?

01:50:10.997 --> 01:50:13.011
MATT: You take 14 points 
of slashing damage,

01:50:13.011 --> 01:50:15.332
as the mandibles slice down,
clamping onto your shoulder.

01:50:15.332 --> 01:50:17.179
You manage to pull free, but in doing so,

01:50:17.179 --> 01:50:19.084
you wrench the pointed
portions of the mandible

01:50:19.084 --> 01:50:21.505
across your shoulder,
pulling open the flesh

01:50:21.505 --> 01:50:23.340
in this horrible jagged pattern.

01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:25.416
TALIESIN: Ow.

01:50:25.416 --> 01:50:27.258
MATT: That brings us to the other one,

01:50:27.258 --> 01:50:28.708
who is attacking Grog.

01:50:28.708 --> 01:50:29.541
MARISHA: Grog!

01:50:29.541 --> 01:50:31.334
You're right there in front of it.

01:50:31.334 --> 01:50:33.749
The biggest and most
viable visual it can find.

01:50:33.749 --> 01:50:35.422
SAM: ♫ No motherfucker, miss ♫

01:50:35.422 --> 01:50:38.538
I start singing using my
Cutting Words reaction.

01:50:39.428 --> 01:50:41.052
To try to distract him.

01:50:41.052 --> 01:50:42.815
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll your d8

01:50:42.815 --> 01:50:44.188
to reduce his attack roll.

01:50:44.188 --> 01:50:46.194
TRAVIS: (laughs) No motherfucker, miss.

01:50:46.194 --> 01:50:47.027
SAM: d8?

01:50:47.027 --> 01:50:47.860
MATT: d8.

01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:48.804
SAM: Three.

01:50:48.804 --> 01:50:49.637
MATT: All right.

01:50:50.610 --> 01:50:53.360
That would have been a 20 to hit.

01:50:54.708 --> 01:50:56.028
That brings it to a 17.

01:50:56.028 --> 01:50:56.861
TRAVIS: 18.

01:50:56.861 --> 01:50:58.183
(group cheers)

01:50:58.183 --> 01:50:59.850
SAM: I saved your life!

01:51:00.370 --> 01:51:02.572
MATT: So, as you begin singing out,

01:51:02.572 --> 01:51:03.775
as it pulls back with--

01:51:03.775 --> 01:51:05.082
SAM: ♫ No motherfucker ♫

01:51:05.082 --> 01:51:06.884
MATT: --its mandibles to strike at Grog,

01:51:06.884 --> 01:51:08.972
it (clicks) looks off to you for a second,

01:51:08.972 --> 01:51:10.621
goes back, at which point
Grog has put his axe

01:51:10.621 --> 01:51:12.531
up to its face and is holding it at bay.

01:51:12.531 --> 01:51:14.824
As its mandibles are
tied in with its blades,

01:51:14.824 --> 01:51:16.996
and the handle of the axe
is trying to hold it back.

01:51:16.996 --> 01:51:19.383
It strikes at you with
its two claws, Grog.

01:51:19.383 --> 01:51:20.882
That is going to be a 27.

01:51:20.882 --> 01:51:21.865
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:51:21.865 --> 01:51:22.863
MATT: And a 14.

01:51:22.863 --> 01:51:23.696
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:51:23.696 --> 01:51:25.996
MATT: Okay, then from the
one claw that gets you,

01:51:25.996 --> 01:51:27.560
you take six points of slashing damage.

01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:28.393
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:51:28.393 --> 01:51:30.248
MATT: All right everyone, roll initiative.

01:51:30.248 --> 01:51:31.237
(group groans)

01:51:31.237 --> 01:51:32.892
LAURA: I'm so scared to roll.

01:51:32.892 --> 01:51:34.542
MARISHA: I know, it's been so bad.

01:51:35.237 --> 01:51:36.690
SAM: Best one of I've had.

01:51:36.690 --> 01:51:38.042
TALIESIN: Ah, not horrible.

01:51:38.042 --> 01:51:38.875
LAURA: Oh, good.

01:51:38.875 --> 01:51:40.050
TRAVIS: Ball sack.

01:51:40.050 --> 01:51:41.383
MARISHA: Uh, it's okay.

01:51:42.293 --> 01:51:44.082
MATT: All right, so, 25 to 20?

01:51:44.082 --> 01:51:45.126
LAURA: 24.

01:51:45.126 --> 01:51:46.000
MATT: 24.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.673
TRAVIS: There you go.
A little redemption.

01:51:47.673 --> 01:51:48.499
LAURA: That's right.

01:51:48.499 --> 01:51:49.695
MATT: Nice, we got some Vex up top.

01:51:49.695 --> 01:51:51.828
20 to 15 anyone?

01:51:51.828 --> 01:51:52.661
TALIESIN: 17.

01:51:52.661 --> 01:51:53.974
MARISHA: 17 as well.

01:51:53.974 --> 01:51:54.806
SAM: 19.

01:51:54.806 --> 01:51:55.639
TRAVIS: Ah, yeah.

01:51:55.639 --> 01:51:56.601
LIAM: 15, 15.

01:51:56.601 --> 01:51:58.769
MATT: All right, 
got some Scanlan up there.

01:51:58.769 --> 01:51:59.602
17, 17.

01:51:59.602 --> 01:52:02.025
LAURA: (whispers) They're both surrounding me
even with my awesome things.

01:52:02.025 --> 01:52:03.292
MATT: Percy, Keyleth.

01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:10.508
MATT: So 15 to--

01:52:10.508 --> 01:52:11.516
LIAM: 15.

01:52:11.516 --> 01:52:12.524
MATT: 15.

01:52:12.524 --> 01:52:14.049
ORION: 13.

01:52:14.049 --> 01:52:14.882
TRAVIS: I'm 14.

01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:17.363
Tiberius and I are 13-14.

01:52:17.363 --> 01:52:18.574
LAURA: Ugh, come on Grog!

01:52:18.574 --> 01:52:19.710
MATT: Wait, uh, 14?

01:52:19.710 --> 01:52:20.543
ORION: 13.

01:52:20.543 --> 01:52:21.376
MATT: 14.

01:52:21.376 --> 01:52:22.856
Grog and Tiberius.

01:52:23.421 --> 01:52:25.118
TRAVIS: It's the ghost pepper cookies.

01:52:25.118 --> 01:52:27.075
MATT: All right, cool.

01:52:27.075 --> 01:52:28.996
Top of the round.

01:52:28.996 --> 01:52:29.829
Vex.

01:52:29.829 --> 01:52:31.231
LAURA: Hyah!

01:52:31.231 --> 01:52:34.534
I am going to shoot the one.

01:52:34.534 --> 01:52:36.182
MATT: Before you do that--

01:52:36.182 --> 01:52:37.169
SAM: Oh, shit!

01:52:37.169 --> 01:52:39.504
MATT: As you're going to
reach back, you look over

01:52:39.504 --> 01:52:43.671
into its strange, glistening,
black, dead, insect-like eyes

01:52:43.671 --> 01:52:47.247
of the umber hulk, and
you feel this strange wave

01:52:47.247 --> 01:52:50.599
of mental confusion
hit your head.

01:52:50.599 --> 01:52:52.124
Go ahead and make a--

01:52:52.124 --> 01:52:53.217
TRAVIS: I knew it.

01:52:53.217 --> 01:52:54.928
MATT: Go ahead and make a saving throw.

01:52:54.928 --> 01:52:57.120
This is going to be charisma saving throw.

01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:59.840
MARISHA: Is this what confused you 
and had you running out the door?

01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:02.488
TRAVIS: I fell out a fucking 120 foot hole.

01:53:03.186 --> 01:53:05.789
MATT: So you roll d20, add your
charisma saving throw

01:53:05.789 --> 01:53:07.246
at the top of your character.

01:53:07.246 --> 01:53:08.846
LAURA: Okay, so I gotta do my math.

01:53:08.846 --> 01:53:11.468
That's 11, but I get a
plus two from my ring

01:53:11.468 --> 01:53:13.708
that I'm wearing for saving throws, so.

01:53:13.708 --> 01:53:15.173
MATT: Okay, so it's 13.

01:53:15.173 --> 01:53:16.122
LAURA: 13.

01:53:16.122 --> 01:53:17.184
MATT: All right.

01:53:17.184 --> 01:53:19.898
The wave of confusion
takes hold over your brain.

01:53:19.898 --> 01:53:21.950
(group groans)

01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:24.309
We're gonna go ahead and
find out what happens.

01:53:24.309 --> 01:53:25.578
(Laura groans)

01:53:25.578 --> 01:53:27.639
TRAVIS: Maybe he'll ask you to make some cookies.

01:53:27.639 --> 01:53:28.960
MATT: All right--

01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:31.181
LAURA: You're gonna have me do 
nothing wrong?

01:53:31.181 --> 01:53:33.760
MATT: You reach for it, and you
space out for a second.

01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:35.625
Your hands fall to your side.

01:53:35.625 --> 01:53:37.473
And you stand there.

01:53:38.707 --> 01:53:39.624
TRAVIS: Aw, fuck.

01:53:39.624 --> 01:53:41.822
MATT: Trinket is looking
for some sort of cue

01:53:41.822 --> 01:53:43.045
from you of what to do.

01:53:43.045 --> 01:53:44.768
LAURA: Does he look confused too?

01:53:44.768 --> 01:53:46.901
MATT: No, but Trinket's looking to you

01:53:46.901 --> 01:53:49.073
for some sort of direction
and is getting none.

01:53:49.073 --> 01:53:50.825
This is a very clustered space, too.

01:53:50.825 --> 01:53:52.365
Can barely see you over this.

01:53:52.365 --> 01:53:53.980
MATT: That brings us to Scanlan.

01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:55.652
LAURA: But I was stealthed, though.

01:53:55.652 --> 01:53:56.690
SAM: Don't worry, I'll help you
my dear.

01:53:56.690 --> 01:53:58.540
MATT: I know. Doesn't matter 
if you're stealthed.

01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:00.507
He couldn't see you,
but you could see him.

01:54:00.507 --> 01:54:02.798
SAM: I'm gonna take a
step back behind Trinket.

01:54:02.798 --> 01:54:03.655
MATT: Okay.

01:54:03.655 --> 01:54:04.696
(Travis Laughs)

01:54:04.696 --> 01:54:05.910
LAURA: Good call.

01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:08.330
SAM: Actually, wait. How
far am I from my furthest--

01:54:08.330 --> 01:54:10.125
MATT: Are you averting your gaze
from the guys,

01:54:10.125 --> 01:54:11.538
or are you looking at 'em directly?

01:54:11.538 --> 01:54:12.786
SAM: No, averting my gaze.

01:54:12.786 --> 01:54:14.027
But how far am I from my--

01:54:14.027 --> 01:54:15.488
LAURA: Nobody look at them.

01:54:15.488 --> 01:54:16.651
SAM: --my furthest fellow?

01:54:16.651 --> 01:54:18.798
Oh, I'm 60 feet, okay.

01:54:18.798 --> 01:54:21.548
And I sing my counter-charm song.

01:54:23.812 --> 01:54:26.742
♫ Magic magic, go away,
come again another day ♫

01:54:26.742 --> 01:54:29.287
So all of us have
advantage on saving throws

01:54:29.287 --> 01:54:31.182
for the charming spells.

01:54:31.182 --> 01:54:32.561
If they are charming us.

01:54:32.561 --> 01:54:34.644
I don't know if they are.

01:54:35.554 --> 01:54:36.991
MATT: This is confusion.

01:54:36.991 --> 01:54:38.248
SAM: No, what?

01:54:38.248 --> 01:54:39.692
MATT: I don't think--

01:54:39.692 --> 01:54:42.561
SAM: Frightened or charmed,
it's not the same thing?

01:54:42.561 --> 01:54:43.394
MATT: Mm.

01:54:47.139 --> 01:54:49.368
This is technically a confusion effect.

01:54:49.368 --> 01:54:50.607
So yeah.

01:54:50.607 --> 01:54:51.440
SAM: Okay.

01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:52.663
LAURA: Oh, wait. Oh, no.

01:54:53.106 --> 01:54:54.161
SAM: Okay.

01:54:54.161 --> 01:54:56.745
MATT: So as you finish your
song, you're like--

01:54:56.745 --> 01:54:58.354
SAM: It did not work.

01:54:58.354 --> 01:55:01.251
MATT: Doesn't seem to be having
an effect unfortunately.

01:55:01.251 --> 01:55:02.251
SAM: Okay.

01:55:02.251 --> 01:55:05.655
And then as my bonus
action, who got hit first?

01:55:06.607 --> 01:55:07.440
You did?

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:09.656
I'll just throw a healing word to him.

01:55:09.656 --> 01:55:10.520
MATT: Okay.

01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:12.687
Just go ahead and roll, feeling him.

01:55:12.687 --> 01:55:14.276
That's a d4 plus five.

01:55:14.276 --> 01:55:15.966
Yeah, you got it.

01:55:15.966 --> 01:55:16.799
Percy.

01:55:16.799 --> 01:55:17.632
TALIESIN: Mm.

01:55:17.632 --> 01:55:19.089
MATT: You heal--

01:55:19.089 --> 01:55:20.042
SAM: What is this?

01:55:20.042 --> 01:55:21.025
MATT: It's a four.

01:55:21.025 --> 01:55:22.421
SAM: Oh, that's a four.
Okay.

01:55:22.421 --> 01:55:25.184
MATT: So you heal nine hit
points, and it's your turn.

01:55:25.184 --> 01:55:26.417
What do you got, Percy?

01:55:26.417 --> 01:55:28.590
TALIESIN: Up to 58, let me just
fix that, there we go.

01:55:28.905 --> 01:55:30.945
Okay, where am I on the board?

01:55:30.945 --> 01:55:32.494
MATT: You are right here in front--

01:55:32.494 --> 01:55:33.679
TALIESIN: Okay, so
there's no getting away.

01:55:33.679 --> 01:55:36.135
I'm gonna-- I can basically without--

01:55:36.135 --> 01:55:37.908
I remember I'm not supposed
to look at these things.

01:55:37.908 --> 01:55:39.624
I know where this thing is.

01:55:39.624 --> 01:55:42.004
I can pull my gun and
just take a shot, right?

01:55:42.004 --> 01:55:44.265
MATT: So averting your gaze, 
you take a shot.

01:55:44.265 --> 01:55:46.424
You are at disadvantage
on the attack roll.

01:55:46.424 --> 01:55:47.347
TALIESIN: How much?

01:55:47.347 --> 01:55:48.630
MATT: Just disadvantage.

01:55:48.630 --> 01:55:49.834
TALIESIN: I'm just disadvantage?

01:55:49.834 --> 01:55:50.667
MATT: Yeah.

01:55:50.667 --> 01:55:51.946
TALIESIN: Well okay, that's fine.

01:55:51.946 --> 01:55:54.288
I'm gonna spend a grit
point for a deadshot,

01:55:54.288 --> 01:55:56.694
so I'm gonna get a plus one to hit.

01:55:56.694 --> 01:55:58.944
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Come on, Perce.

01:56:00.250 --> 01:56:01.500
TALIESIN: Aha!

01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:05.667
That will be a-- with the plus
one, that's a 28, 29, 30 to hit.

01:56:05.667 --> 01:56:06.500
MATT: Okay.

01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:07.973
TRAVIS: Get after it, nasty!

01:56:07.973 --> 01:56:10.212
MATT: Roll again, as you 
have disadvantage.

01:56:10.212 --> 01:56:11.782
Because you're not looking at it directly.

01:56:11.782 --> 01:56:13.655
LAURA: Ugh, please be good.

01:56:13.655 --> 01:56:15.682
TALIESIN: That's still 25 to hit.

01:56:15.682 --> 01:56:16.515
MATT: That hits.

01:56:16.515 --> 01:56:17.611
TALIESIN: 26, actually.

01:56:17.611 --> 01:56:19.334
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

01:56:19.334 --> 01:56:21.978
TALIESIN: And then I get extra damage
because I did deadshot.

01:56:21.978 --> 01:56:23.945
So that's plus one, so that will be a--

01:56:24.770 --> 01:56:28.487
it's a 2d8 plus five plus
ice, because I'm hitting

01:56:28.487 --> 01:56:29.904
with my ice shot.

01:56:33.497 --> 01:56:37.493
And that's seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

01:56:37.493 --> 01:56:39.493
14 points of ice damage.

01:56:40.574 --> 01:56:42.447
MATT: 14 points of ice damage.
Nice.

01:56:43.026 --> 01:56:45.108
TALIESIN: And then I have a second shot

01:56:45.108 --> 01:56:48.161
and I'm just gonna take one
more shot at him really quick.

01:56:48.161 --> 01:56:50.578
MATT: Okay, also at disadvantage.

01:56:51.476 --> 01:56:52.410
TALIESIN: I fail.

01:56:52.410 --> 01:56:53.953
In fact, my gun jams.

01:56:53.953 --> 01:56:55.524
(group groans)

01:56:55.524 --> 01:56:56.534
MATT: Okay.

01:56:56.534 --> 01:56:58.052
So as you go to fire, it's
like you-- (imitates gun firing)

01:56:58.052 --> 01:56:59.669
fire the first shot averting the gaze.

01:56:59.669 --> 01:57:01.080
LAURA: We're all gonna die.

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:03.351
You spin the barrel, go back
to go ahead and fire again,

01:57:03.351 --> 01:57:04.811
as you do (imitates gun clicking)

01:57:04.811 --> 01:57:07.454
You pull the trigger for a
second, and you feel a slight

01:57:07.454 --> 01:57:08.512
(imitates fizzled explosion)
inside the barrel.

01:57:08.512 --> 01:57:09.345
TRAVIS: Damn it!

01:57:09.345 --> 01:57:10.178
MARISHA: Oh, no.

01:57:10.178 --> 01:57:12.464
MATT: And you feel the actual
metal get extremely cold,

01:57:12.464 --> 01:57:14.587
and you have you have to shake
it out like, aw, damn it.

01:57:14.587 --> 01:57:18.934
TALIESIN: Since I can't move,
I'm gonna--

01:57:18.934 --> 01:57:22.286
my movement, my minor is gonna
be just fixing my-- yeah, so.

01:57:22.286 --> 01:57:25.146
MATT: Okay, so your action is
just trying to fix the gun?

01:57:25.146 --> 01:57:26.201
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:57:26.201 --> 01:57:27.034
MATT: All right.

01:57:27.034 --> 01:57:27.867
That brings us to--

01:57:27.867 --> 01:57:29.387
TALIESIN: Damn.

01:57:29.387 --> 01:57:30.387
MATT: Keyleth.

01:57:30.387 --> 01:57:33.486
LAURA: Keyleth, don't look at them.

01:57:33.486 --> 01:57:34.536
MARISHA: Okay.

01:57:34.536 --> 01:57:36.898
MATT: Just as a note, your
inspiration dice that you give

01:57:36.898 --> 01:57:39.517
can be used on saving throws as well.

01:57:39.517 --> 01:57:40.892
SAM: Okay.

01:57:40.892 --> 01:57:42.384
But I haven't given any.

01:57:42.384 --> 01:57:43.217
MATT: No.

01:57:44.597 --> 01:57:47.372
MARISHA: Um, I'm a bear right now.

01:57:47.372 --> 01:57:51.539
MATT: You are a bear, which I
will, for the sake of this,

01:57:52.037 --> 01:57:53.240
give you the kitty.

01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:54.563
MARISHA: Bring out Minxie.

01:57:54.563 --> 01:57:55.396
TRAVIS: Minxie.

01:57:55.396 --> 01:57:58.244
MATT: Minxie is the form, 
but you are a bear.

01:57:58.244 --> 01:58:02.077
MARISHA: Okay, first and foremost,
I'm gonna go ahead--

01:58:03.853 --> 01:58:05.866
and I don't know if this is gonna help.

01:58:05.866 --> 01:58:08.674
But I'm gonna throw up a fog cloud.

01:58:08.674 --> 01:58:09.507
MATT: Okay.

01:58:09.507 --> 01:58:10.340
MARISHA: Maybe.

01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:11.173
MATT: Okay.

01:58:11.173 --> 01:58:12.006
MARISHA: No?

01:58:12.006 --> 01:58:12.839
MATT: So fog cloud.

01:58:12.839 --> 01:58:14.542
The entire space, it's a 20 foot radius?

01:58:14.542 --> 01:58:17.221
I believe, if I recall from
the one he did yesterday.

01:58:17.221 --> 01:58:19.489
MARISHA: But it screws our vision,
though, doesn't it?

01:58:19.489 --> 01:58:20.505
LAURA: Well, yeah.

01:58:20.505 --> 01:58:21.991
MATT: Everybody gets obscured vision.

01:58:21.991 --> 01:58:24.266
MARISHA: But I mean, we
wouldn't be able to see them.

01:58:24.266 --> 01:58:25.852
Would it help with the
confusion is what I'm hoping.

01:58:25.852 --> 01:58:27.787
LAURA: That could help, that could help.

01:58:27.787 --> 01:58:29.259
SAM: Do your thing.
Do what you do.

01:58:29.259 --> 01:58:30.382
MARISHA: Or would it be bad?

01:58:30.382 --> 01:58:31.215
LAURA: Try it.

01:58:31.215 --> 01:58:32.428
Do it, Keyleth, go with your instincts.

01:58:32.428 --> 01:58:34.044
TALIESIN: Don't think about what's the worst
that could possibly happen.

01:58:34.044 --> 01:58:35.913
MARISHA: I'm bursting out a fog cloud, and then--

01:58:35.913 --> 01:58:37.046
MATT: Well to cast, you have to get out

01:58:37.046 --> 01:58:39.440
of creature form, remember?

01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:41.184
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.

01:58:41.184 --> 01:58:43.020
I didn't throw a bow.

01:58:43.020 --> 01:58:43.909
MATT: So you're a bear.

01:58:43.909 --> 01:58:44.742
MARISHA: I'm a bear.

01:58:44.742 --> 01:58:45.949
Nevermind, I'm just gonna
do a full round of attacks.

01:58:45.949 --> 01:58:46.976
LIAM: It's go time, go time! (claps)

01:58:46.976 --> 01:58:48.099
MARISHA: That one right there.

01:58:48.099 --> 01:58:49.156
LAURA: Keep your eyes closed.

01:58:49.156 --> 01:58:51.185
MATT: All right, so you move up to there.

01:58:51.185 --> 01:58:52.663
Go ahead and do
your full round of attacks.

01:58:52.663 --> 01:58:54.363
MATT: I am doing multi-attack.

01:58:54.363 --> 01:58:56.753
MATT: Okay, are you averting 
your gaze or not?

01:58:56.753 --> 01:58:58.601
MARISHA: I'm a cave bear, I'm blind.

01:58:58.601 --> 01:59:00.740
I'm like a blind fish.

01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:03.459
I have darkvision and, like, cataracts.

01:59:03.459 --> 01:59:05.708
MATT: Darkvision means you 
can see in the dark.

01:59:05.708 --> 01:59:08.098
MATT: But it doesn't mean 
that you don't see.

01:59:08.098 --> 01:59:09.102
(Sam laughs)

01:59:09.102 --> 01:59:10.355
MARISHA: Well I'm a bear.

01:59:10.355 --> 01:59:11.468
MATT: You are a bear.

01:59:11.468 --> 01:59:12.678
I'm eating at his leg.

01:59:12.678 --> 01:59:14.153
I'm not looking at his eyes.

01:59:14.153 --> 01:59:17.775
I'm not, like, waxing
poetically at how sexy he is.

01:59:17.775 --> 01:59:18.608
MATT: No.

01:59:18.608 --> 01:59:20.130
MARISHA: Not whispering sweet nothings
in his ear.

01:59:20.130 --> 01:59:20.963
MATT: I know.

01:59:20.963 --> 01:59:21.797
MARISHA: I'm gnawing at his leg.

01:59:21.797 --> 01:59:22.770
MATT: That's true.

01:59:22.770 --> 01:59:23.783
LIAM: Go for the kill!

01:59:23.783 --> 01:59:25.442
MATT: Make a charisma saving throw.

01:59:25.442 --> 01:59:27.082
MARISHA: Make a charisma saving throw?

01:59:27.082 --> 01:59:27.915
MATT: Yes.

01:59:27.915 --> 01:59:28.779
(Travis laughs)

01:59:28.779 --> 01:59:30.617
LAURA: Next time just avert your gaze.

01:59:30.617 --> 01:59:31.878
[Taliesin And Marisha] Oh!

01:59:31.878 --> 01:59:32.962
MARISHA: That's good.

01:59:32.962 --> 01:59:33.795
16.

01:59:33.795 --> 01:59:34.628
MATT: 16?

01:59:34.628 --> 01:59:37.358
You can feel the oppression
of the umber hulk's gaze,

01:59:37.358 --> 01:59:39.711
but you shrug it off, your
bear mind not affected

01:59:39.711 --> 01:59:41.836
by the measly tricks and traits--

01:59:41.836 --> 01:59:43.129
MARISHA: Urgh, I'm a bear!

01:59:43.129 --> 01:59:45.168
MATT: -of these strange underground entities.

01:59:45.168 --> 01:59:46.001
MARISHA: Okay.

01:59:46.001 --> 01:59:47.001
Now I'm attacking.

01:59:47.001 --> 01:59:48.410
MATT: Roll for your four attacks.

01:59:48.410 --> 01:59:52.008
MARISHA: First one probably misses.

01:59:52.008 --> 01:59:53.425
With my claw, 14.

01:59:54.810 --> 01:59:55.810
MATT: 14 misses.

01:59:58.639 --> 01:59:59.639
(group laughs)

01:59:59.639 --> 02:00:00.649
ORION: She got a pizza.

02:00:00.649 --> 02:00:03.309
MARISHA: With the claw attacks, do
I have two claw attacks,

02:00:03.309 --> 02:00:04.447
do I roll for both?

02:00:04.447 --> 02:00:05.628
MATT: Yeah.

02:00:05.628 --> 02:00:08.211
MARISHA: Okay, so the first one is 19,

02:00:10.229 --> 02:00:11.062
MATT: Hits.

02:00:11.062 --> 02:00:14.312
MARISHA: Second one, second claw attack is 18.

02:00:15.911 --> 02:00:16.744
MATT: Also hits.

02:00:16.744 --> 02:00:17.577
MARISHA: Okay.

02:00:17.577 --> 02:00:20.410
So I am doing 2d6 plus five twice.

02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:24.867
So six plus--

02:00:26.385 --> 02:00:27.408
TALIESIN: It's 11.

02:00:27.408 --> 02:00:28.575
MARISHA: Five, so 11.

02:00:29.413 --> 02:00:30.246
TALIESIN: Ooh.

02:00:30.246 --> 02:00:31.269
MARISHA: Plus 17--

02:00:33.093 --> 02:00:34.443
20 damage.

02:00:34.443 --> 02:00:35.736
MATT: 20 damage. Nice.

02:00:36.109 --> 02:00:37.125
TALIESIN: 25.

02:00:37.125 --> 02:00:38.112
MARISHA: Oh, 25.

02:00:38.112 --> 02:00:38.945
Sorry, 25.

02:00:38.948 --> 02:00:39.941
MATT: All righty.

02:00:39.941 --> 02:00:41.107
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:00:41.107 --> 02:00:42.160
MARISHA: 25 damage.

02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:45.001
MATT: So, as you shake off the
effect, you reach for it,

02:00:45.001 --> 02:00:47.010
lashing out, two large strikes.

02:00:47.010 --> 02:00:49.379
The second one gets a
distinct carve into the back

02:00:49.379 --> 02:00:50.559
of the umber hulk's hide.

02:00:50.559 --> 02:00:52.909
You can see a portion of
its chitinous back armor

02:00:52.909 --> 02:00:54.820
gets kind of pulled off in a chunk.

02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:57.324
And it (snarls), reels
back from the impact

02:00:57.324 --> 02:00:59.054
and readies itself for a
second round of attacks.

02:00:59.054 --> 02:01:00.374
MARISHA: Me and Trinket.

02:01:00.374 --> 02:01:01.397
MATT: There you go.

02:01:01.397 --> 02:01:02.560
MARISHA: Going at this.

02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:03.393
(Matt laughs)

02:01:03.393 --> 02:01:05.244
MARISHA: Bear style.

02:01:05.244 --> 02:01:06.077
MATT: They go.

02:01:07.057 --> 02:01:10.931
This one turns towards and
moves this way to focus

02:01:10.931 --> 02:01:13.718
on the cave bear that just
thrashed against its hide.

02:01:13.718 --> 02:01:17.635
While this one turns and
moves in towards Grog.

02:01:19.319 --> 02:01:21.441
But now turns and sees the-- actually no.

02:01:21.441 --> 02:01:23.579
It stays there, fixed to Grog.

02:01:23.579 --> 02:01:27.496
So making its multi-strike
against you, Keyleth.

02:01:28.584 --> 02:01:30.796
That is a 26 to hit.

02:01:30.796 --> 02:01:31.662
MARISHA: Hits.

02:01:31.662 --> 02:01:33.489
MATT: That's mandibles.

02:01:33.489 --> 02:01:34.959
17 to hit with its claw.

02:01:34.959 --> 02:01:36.450
MARISHA: Hits.

02:01:36.450 --> 02:01:38.600
MATT: And 18 to hit with its claw.

02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:39.433
MARISHA: Hits.

02:01:39.433 --> 02:01:42.208
MATT: All right, so you take six
points of slashing damage

02:01:42.208 --> 02:01:43.875
from the first claw.

02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:47.462
Eight points of slashing
damage from the second claw.

02:01:47.462 --> 02:01:49.928
And then the mandibles deal fifteen points

02:01:49.928 --> 02:01:53.105
of slashing damage, as the
umber hulk just turns to you,

02:01:53.105 --> 02:01:55.275
and as a reaction to your assault--

02:01:55.275 --> 02:01:56.643
MARISHA: What was the last one?

02:01:56.643 --> 02:01:58.929
MATT: The last one was 15.

02:01:58.929 --> 02:02:01.513
Just unleashes an array
of strikes against you.

02:02:01.513 --> 02:02:03.061
(Matt growls)

02:02:03.061 --> 02:02:04.857
LIAM: Hit it in the face.

02:02:04.857 --> 02:02:07.922
MATT: That brings us to the other
one who's attacking you, Grog.

02:02:07.922 --> 02:02:09.174
MARISHA: Back at him, yeah.

02:02:09.174 --> 02:02:11.361
MATT: That is a 12 to hit.
Pretty sure misses.

02:02:11.361 --> 02:02:12.349
TRAVIS: Misses.

02:02:12.349 --> 02:02:15.814
MATT: Another 12 to hit, 
'cause it likes to roll fours, apparently.

02:02:15.814 --> 02:02:17.467
TRAVIS: Give me another four.

02:02:17.467 --> 02:02:18.897
MATT: For the mandibles, it's a 20.

02:02:18.897 --> 02:02:19.724
TRAVIS: 20 hits.

02:02:19.724 --> 02:02:22.229
MATT: You're taking damage, fool.

02:02:22.229 --> 02:02:25.838
That is 18 points of
slashing damage against you.

02:02:25.838 --> 02:02:27.999
TRAVIS: I have a half damage to
all bludgeoning, piercing,

02:02:27.999 --> 02:02:28.900
and slashing damage?

02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:29.733
MATT: You haven't raged yet.

02:02:29.733 --> 02:02:30.714
TRAVIS: So I'm not raging?!

02:02:30.714 --> 02:02:31.547
MATT: You haven't raged yet!

02:02:31.547 --> 02:02:32.501
It isn't your turn yet.

02:02:32.501 --> 02:02:33.486
TRAVIS: But I'm so angry.

02:02:33.486 --> 02:02:34.319
MATT: I know.

02:02:34.319 --> 02:02:35.774
You're about to be so angry.

02:02:35.774 --> 02:02:36.717
TRAVIS: 18 points.

02:02:36.717 --> 02:02:38.154
MATT: You're gonna be so angry.

02:02:38.154 --> 02:02:39.752
18 points of slashing damage.

02:02:39.752 --> 02:02:42.157
The mandibles crush down on your body,

02:02:42.157 --> 02:02:44.027
and you can feel them
pierce into your chest.

02:02:44.027 --> 02:02:47.049
Your exposed musculature is
then torn in a jagged form

02:02:47.049 --> 02:02:49.567
as you feel the blood begin
to pour down the front

02:02:49.567 --> 02:02:50.380
of your torso.

02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:51.313
TRAVIS: It's all right, it's okay.

02:02:51.313 --> 02:02:52.198
LAURA: That's brutal.

02:02:52.198 --> 02:02:54.165
TRAVIS: My turn's coming.
MATT: That ends their turn.

02:02:54.165 --> 02:02:55.220
Vax.

02:02:55.220 --> 02:02:56.475
LIAM: So I can see what's up.

02:02:56.475 --> 02:02:58.750
I saw what it did to my sister,

02:02:58.750 --> 02:03:00.374
so I'm gonna jump on its back.

02:03:00.374 --> 02:03:02.134
I'm gonna swivel my daggers around

02:03:02.134 --> 02:03:03.584
and just stab it in the face.

02:03:03.584 --> 02:03:05.029
LAURA: But keep your gaze averted.

02:03:05.029 --> 02:03:07.808
LIAM: Yeah, I'm seeing the
back of his fucking spine or head.

02:03:07.808 --> 02:03:09.481
I'm gonna stab
him in the face twice.

02:03:09.481 --> 02:03:10.314
MATT: Go for it.

02:03:10.314 --> 02:03:11.266
LIAM: Okay.

02:03:11.266 --> 02:03:12.715
LIAM: Nine--

02:03:14.107 --> 02:03:15.686
20.

02:03:15.686 --> 02:03:16.519
MATT: That hits.

02:03:16.519 --> 02:03:17.352
LIAM: Okay.

02:03:17.352 --> 02:03:18.585
So then I'll do damage.

02:03:18.585 --> 02:03:20.078
The other one's an 18.

02:03:20.078 --> 02:03:21.329
I rolled in advance.

02:03:21.329 --> 02:03:22.952
LAURA: That counts, that counts!

02:03:22.952 --> 02:03:24.728
MATT: That one, that's the one!

02:03:24.728 --> 02:03:28.222
LIAM: So, 10, plus sneak attack damage, right?

02:03:28.222 --> 02:03:29.055
MATT: Yeah.

02:03:29.055 --> 02:03:29.888
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

02:03:29.888 --> 02:03:32.834
MATT: He doesn't know you were
there, you were stealthed.

02:03:32.834 --> 02:03:33.586
LIAM: Okay.

02:03:33.586 --> 02:03:34.490
One. Four.

02:03:35.344 --> 02:03:36.526
Eight.

02:03:36.526 --> 02:03:37.359
Nine.

02:03:38.325 --> 02:03:41.985
13, 26, 36 damage from the first dagger.

02:03:41.985 --> 02:03:42.801
MARISHA: Whoo!

02:03:42.801 --> 02:03:44.729
LIAM: Face, in his face, 
and the next was an 18.

02:03:44.729 --> 02:03:45.962
MATT: Not in his face.

02:03:45.962 --> 02:03:46.970
Not in his face.

02:03:46.970 --> 02:03:47.833
LIAM: Not in his face?

02:03:47.833 --> 02:03:49.388
MATT: It's back.

02:03:49.388 --> 02:03:51.216
LIAM: But I wanted I wanted
to do this to his head.

02:03:51.216 --> 02:03:52.065
Okay, whatever works.

02:03:52.065 --> 02:03:53.666
TRAVIS: The reach around?

02:03:53.666 --> 02:03:55.309
ORION: The old reach around stabbing.

02:03:55.309 --> 02:03:57.230
LIAM: The reach around, the reach around.

02:03:57.230 --> 02:03:58.513
That what I was going for.

02:03:58.513 --> 02:04:01.263
And then, where's my four, 1d4.

02:04:03.835 --> 02:04:06.289
One's a three, but no, just three.

02:04:06.289 --> 02:04:07.122
MATT: Three, okay.

02:04:07.122 --> 02:04:08.834
LIAM: With my flametongue dagger

02:04:08.834 --> 02:04:10.427
which I don't know if
he likes or dislikes,

02:04:10.427 --> 02:04:11.372
but that's what I've done.

02:04:11.372 --> 02:04:14.226
MATT: Okay, so, as you leap on its
back, grab purchase

02:04:14.226 --> 02:04:16.796
on one of its chitinous
plates, bring your first dagger

02:04:16.796 --> 02:04:19.037
forward and jam it into
the side of its head,

02:04:19.037 --> 02:04:21.098
as it pulls back, you hear a (snarling)

02:04:21.098 --> 02:04:22.369
as it reacts to the immediate pain

02:04:22.369 --> 02:04:24.421
and begins to
reach one of its claws

02:04:24.421 --> 02:04:25.800
to try and knock you off.

02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:28.413
As you do, you put the
blade back into your belt,

02:04:28.413 --> 02:04:30.017
grab with your other hand,
pull your other dagger,

02:04:30.017 --> 02:04:31.843
and slam it into the
other side of its head.

02:04:31.843 --> 02:04:32.676
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:04:32.676 --> 02:04:34.409
MATT: This time it shrugs you off,

02:04:34.409 --> 02:04:36.860
and you manage to just
land on your feet barely,

02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:39.141
behind it, still faced away from you.

02:04:39.141 --> 02:04:41.026
That brings us to Grog.

02:04:41.026 --> 02:04:41.859
(Travis grunts)

02:04:41.859 --> 02:04:42.692
Rage.

02:04:42.692 --> 02:04:43.525
MARISHA: Rage!

02:04:43.525 --> 02:04:44.472
TRAVIS: Now I'm angry.

02:04:44.472 --> 02:04:45.305
MATT: Okay.

02:04:45.305 --> 02:04:48.057
TRAVIS: I would like to rage, 
and not only rage,

02:04:48.057 --> 02:04:50.726
I would like to go into a frenzied rage.

02:04:50.726 --> 02:04:51.559
MATT: Okay.

02:04:51.559 --> 02:04:53.558
TRAVIS: For three full attacks.

02:04:53.558 --> 02:04:54.391
MATT: All right.

02:04:54.391 --> 02:04:58.866
TRAVIS: While I'm raging so hard,
that I pop all the capillaries

02:04:58.866 --> 02:05:03.248
in my eyeballs, so I can't
really see that well.

02:05:03.248 --> 02:05:05.519
And I just swing a lot.

02:05:05.519 --> 02:05:07.185
MATT: All right, I'm gonna check
one thing real fast.

02:05:07.185 --> 02:05:08.022
LAURA: Oh, no.

02:05:08.022 --> 02:05:09.769
TRAVIS: Oh, shit! 
Don't check, look, I'm rolling.

02:05:09.769 --> 02:05:10.886
(Marisha and Laura laugh)

02:05:10.886 --> 02:05:11.734
30.

02:05:11.734 --> 02:05:14.085
LIAM: There once was a bard from Nantucket.

02:05:14.085 --> 02:05:16.569
(group laughs)

02:05:16.569 --> 02:05:18.960
LIAM: Who got his flute caught--

02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:20.206
TRAVIS: I gain one level of
exhaustion with a rage hit.

02:05:20.206 --> 02:05:21.383
LIAM: --in a bucket.

02:05:21.383 --> 02:05:23.992
MATT: I will say, situationally,
because of the fact

02:05:23.992 --> 02:05:27.069
that your rage that you have
advantage on the saving throw

02:05:27.069 --> 02:05:28.663
against the confusion effect.

02:05:28.663 --> 02:05:29.806
[Marisha and Laura] Oh.

02:05:29.806 --> 02:05:32.716
Your mind is so filled with aggression.

02:05:32.716 --> 02:05:35.311
TRAVIS: I got that big, like, nasty thing.

02:05:35.311 --> 02:05:37.502
MATT: So make charisma saving throw.

02:05:37.502 --> 02:05:38.965
TALIESIN: Oh, what a good idea.

02:05:38.965 --> 02:05:40.018
TRAVIS: Is that a 20?

02:05:40.018 --> 02:05:41.055
MATT: Yep.

02:05:41.055 --> 02:05:41.972
LAURA: Plus one.

02:05:41.972 --> 02:05:43.058
TRAVIS: 11.

02:05:43.058 --> 02:05:44.901
MATT: Roll again, you have advantage.

02:05:45.522 --> 02:05:46.865
LIAM: Better, better, better, no.

02:05:46.865 --> 02:05:47.698
TRAVIS: Five.

02:05:47.698 --> 02:05:48.531
LAURA: Oh no!

02:05:48.531 --> 02:05:50.009
MATT: Let's see what happens.

02:05:50.009 --> 02:05:50.842
LAURA: No!

02:05:52.120 --> 02:05:52.980
ORION: Roll a two.

02:05:52.980 --> 02:05:53.933
MATT: So--

02:05:53.933 --> 02:05:55.497
(group groans)

02:05:55.497 --> 02:05:56.509
LAURA: Now he's raging, too.

02:05:56.509 --> 02:05:57.676
MATT: --as you rage--

02:05:58.847 --> 02:05:59.930
MARISHA: No, dammit.

02:06:00.926 --> 02:06:05.009
MATT: --you feel the influence
of the umber hulk's gaze

02:06:06.498 --> 02:06:09.582
pierce your eyes and the fury fills you,

02:06:09.582 --> 02:06:13.082
and you reach out and slash with your axe.

02:06:14.424 --> 02:06:18.257
However, it does not
reach for the umber hulk.

02:06:19.238 --> 02:06:20.595
Go ahead and roll an attack, Grog.

02:06:20.595 --> 02:06:22.867
LAURA: Oh no, who's he hitting?

02:06:22.867 --> 02:06:23.784
TRAVIS: A one!

02:06:23.784 --> 02:06:25.286
(group cheers)

02:06:25.286 --> 02:06:26.119
SAM: Finally!

02:06:27.751 --> 02:06:28.584
MARISHA: Yes!

02:06:29.812 --> 02:06:33.733
MATT: There's a loud clanging
sound, as a giant, angry,

02:06:33.733 --> 02:06:37.900
swooping bladed greataxe misses
Tiberius's head by inches.

02:06:40.023 --> 02:06:40.949
ORION: Oh!

02:06:40.949 --> 02:06:42.263
Grog, what are you doing?

02:06:42.263 --> 02:06:45.690
MATT: Before slamming into the stone
right up against the side of the wall.

02:06:45.690 --> 02:06:48.244
You can just see now this
kind of loose, crazed look

02:06:48.244 --> 02:06:49.711
in his eye. (growls maniacally)

02:06:49.711 --> 02:06:51.584
MATT: Foam begins to gather at
the side of his mouth.

02:06:51.584 --> 02:06:52.913
ORION: Oh, now you're all screwed up.

02:06:52.913 --> 02:06:54.558
LIAM: We have a problem.

02:06:54.558 --> 02:06:55.711
LAURA: Yeah, this could be bad.

02:06:55.711 --> 02:06:56.924
LIAM: We have an angry Grog.

02:06:56.924 --> 02:06:58.047
MATT: Tiberius, you're up.

02:06:58.047 --> 02:06:58.880
ORION: Damn it, Grog.

02:06:58.880 --> 02:06:59.943
TRAVIS: It's my turn?

02:06:59.943 --> 02:07:01.336
MATT: No, that's your turn.

02:07:01.339 --> 02:07:02.682
TRAVIS: Oh, that's my turn.

02:07:02.682 --> 02:07:03.878
MARISHA: Tiberius, help.

02:07:03.878 --> 02:07:05.323
LAURA: At least your rolled a one.

02:07:05.323 --> 02:07:06.152
TRAVIS: I did.

02:07:06.152 --> 02:07:07.245
I didn't hurt anybody yet.

02:07:07.245 --> 02:07:10.002
ORION: I look at Grog, and I'm
like, will you stop it!

02:07:10.002 --> 02:07:11.524
I cast Dispel Magic on him.

02:07:11.524 --> 02:07:13.047
(Travis snarls)

02:07:13.047 --> 02:07:13.880
MATT: Cast Dispel Magic?

02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:14.713
ORION: Yeah.

02:07:14.713 --> 02:07:15.546
LAURA: On Grog?

02:07:15.546 --> 02:07:16.379
MATT: Okay.

02:07:16.379 --> 02:07:17.835
SAM: I don't think it's magic.

02:07:17.835 --> 02:07:19.543
ORION: Yeah, he's being controlled by it.

02:07:19.543 --> 02:07:20.556
TRAVIS: He can do whatever.

02:07:20.556 --> 02:07:22.700
LIAM: It's more natural, 
it's creature-based.

02:07:22.700 --> 02:07:24.206
TRAVIS: She's also being controlled.

02:07:24.206 --> 02:07:26.550
ORION: I know, but you're a
big, hulking, crazy mofo.

02:07:26.550 --> 02:07:28.339
MATT: No, it is a magical force.

02:07:28.339 --> 02:07:29.745
ORION: Yes, it is.

02:07:29.745 --> 02:07:31.428
MATT: Forced to make a save.

02:07:31.428 --> 02:07:32.741
TRAVIS: Save me, save me.

02:07:32.741 --> 02:07:34.718
MATT: Go head and make an arcana check.

02:07:34.718 --> 02:07:38.604
(Sam and Laura sing along
with tense background music)

02:07:38.604 --> 02:07:40.099
ORION: Uh, 17.

02:07:40.099 --> 02:07:41.433
MATT: 17.

02:07:41.433 --> 02:07:44.154
The chaotic influence in your
brain begins to dissipate,

02:07:44.154 --> 02:07:45.932
and the rage-filled gaze begins

02:07:45.932 --> 02:07:47.420
to fill your eyes once again,

02:07:47.420 --> 02:07:49.619
this time clarifying on the
umber hulk in front of you.

02:07:49.619 --> 02:07:50.962
LAURA: Thanks a lot, Tiberius.

02:07:50.962 --> 02:07:51.795
SAM: Thank god.

02:07:51.795 --> 02:07:53.074
ORION: I'm not done yet.

02:07:53.074 --> 02:07:55.041
I slap him.
Just get on this, will you?

02:07:55.041 --> 02:07:55.867
(Travis snarls)

02:07:55.867 --> 02:07:57.898
ORION: I use two SP points to
do quickening spell.

02:07:57.898 --> 02:08:01.470
I cast Grand Column under
myself. (imitates rock moving)

02:08:01.470 --> 02:08:02.700
Fifteen feet up in the air.

02:08:02.700 --> 02:08:03.750
MARISHA: Nice.

02:08:03.750 --> 02:08:04.686
(Orion spits)

02:08:04.686 --> 02:08:07.256
MATT: So, the stone beneath
Tiberius's feet rises up,

02:08:07.256 --> 02:08:10.058
creating a column fifteen
feet above the rest.

02:08:10.058 --> 02:08:13.277
He is now raised on a platform.

02:08:13.277 --> 02:08:15.954
I'll put him right there.

02:08:15.954 --> 02:08:17.741
Looking down upon the battlefield.

02:08:17.741 --> 02:08:19.527
ORION: (clears throat) that is my turn.

02:08:19.527 --> 02:08:20.879
MATT: All right, Vex, you're up.

02:08:20.879 --> 02:08:22.661
LAURA: Oh, do I have to cast a saving throw

02:08:22.661 --> 02:08:23.494
or am I fine?

02:08:23.494 --> 02:08:24.553
LIAM: Be a badass, be a badass.

02:08:24.553 --> 02:08:25.769
MATT: Are you looking at it, or
are you averting your gaze?

02:08:25.769 --> 02:08:27.848
LAURA: No, I'm averting my gaze even though

02:08:27.848 --> 02:08:29.228
I'm confused apparently.

02:08:29.228 --> 02:08:31.051
MATT: Well, the confusion only lasts one turn.

02:08:31.051 --> 02:08:32.288
LAURA: Okay, good.

02:08:32.288 --> 02:08:33.121
I am not.

02:08:33.774 --> 02:08:35.585
What's that thingy behind me?

02:08:35.585 --> 02:08:36.648
MARISHA: Oh, we've got these.

02:08:36.648 --> 02:08:37.686
MATT: This here?

02:08:37.686 --> 02:08:38.519
LAURA: No.

02:08:38.519 --> 02:08:39.352
MATT: This here?

02:08:39.352 --> 02:08:40.185
LAURA: Yeah, what's that?

02:08:40.185 --> 02:08:41.018
MATT: This is rock.

02:08:41.018 --> 02:08:42.001
LAURA: How high is it?

02:08:42.001 --> 02:08:43.751
MATT: This is about 25, 30 feet up.

02:08:43.751 --> 02:08:45.314
TRAVIS: Use your laser pointer, dude.

02:08:45.314 --> 02:08:46.577
MATT: And this is where the light
source is coming from.

02:08:46.577 --> 02:08:47.902
You can't look over that way.

02:08:47.902 --> 02:08:49.825
LAURA: All, right cool. 
I avert my gaze

02:08:49.825 --> 02:08:52.455
but I listen very carefully to the sound

02:08:52.455 --> 02:08:54.002
of where it's coming from.

02:08:54.002 --> 02:08:54.835
(Taliesin whistles)

02:08:54.835 --> 02:08:56.862
LAURA: And I shoot in that direction.

02:08:56.862 --> 02:08:57.695
MATT: Okay.

02:08:57.695 --> 02:08:58.528
(Taliesin and Marisha imitate birds)

02:08:58.528 --> 02:08:59.858
MATT: So go ahead and make your
attacks against this fellow.

02:08:59.858 --> 02:09:01.504
TRAVIS: That's some Hawkeye stuff.

02:09:01.504 --> 02:09:02.899
MATT: You shooting this one?

02:09:02.899 --> 02:09:04.967
LAURA: Let's do the one that is surrounded

02:09:04.967 --> 02:09:07.309
so I get like, what,
flanking bonus or something.

02:09:07.309 --> 02:09:09.317
MATT: For ranged, you would not get a bonus

02:09:09.317 --> 02:09:10.490
for that unfortunately.

02:09:10.490 --> 02:09:11.743
LAURA: Lame. All right.

02:09:11.743 --> 02:09:13.798
MATT: So are you shooting 
at the one behind you?

02:09:13.798 --> 02:09:14.624
This one?

02:09:14.624 --> 02:09:15.457
LAURA: Sure.

02:09:15.457 --> 02:09:16.283
Okay.

02:09:16.283 --> 02:09:17.956
LAURA: No, no, no, no, the other one.

02:09:17.956 --> 02:09:18.789
MATT: Okay, all right.

02:09:18.789 --> 02:09:20.206
So, make your attacks with a disadvantage,

02:09:20.206 --> 02:09:21.602
as you're kind of keeping your eyes back

02:09:21.602 --> 02:09:24.016
and shooting in its general direction.

02:09:24.016 --> 02:09:26.202
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies.

02:09:26.202 --> 02:09:27.729
LAURA: 12, both of them were 12.

02:09:28.372 --> 02:09:29.210
But plus 11.

02:09:29.210 --> 02:09:30.233
MATT: Plus, eleven?

02:09:30.233 --> 02:09:31.066
Hits.

02:09:31.066 --> 02:09:31.899
LAURA: Yes!

02:09:31.899 --> 02:09:33.629
Oh, and I get two attacks, right?

02:09:33.629 --> 02:09:34.633
MATT: You do, yes.

02:09:34.633 --> 02:09:35.466
LAURA: Okay.

02:09:37.285 --> 02:09:38.118
Still disadvantage?

02:09:38.118 --> 02:09:39.598
MATT: Yep.

02:09:39.598 --> 02:09:41.539
LAURA: 15 plus 11, hits.

02:09:41.539 --> 02:09:42.838
MATT: That also hits, yeah.

02:09:42.838 --> 02:09:43.996
So both attacks hit.

02:09:43.996 --> 02:09:44.901
LAURA: Yes!

02:09:44.901 --> 02:09:46.582
MATT: Did you want to use your
bonus action for anything?

02:09:46.582 --> 02:09:48.481
LAURA: Oh yes, Hunter's Mark.

02:09:48.481 --> 02:09:49.355
MATT: All right, so you throw Hunter's Mark

02:09:49.355 --> 02:09:50.731
on this umber hulk there.

02:09:50.731 --> 02:09:52.294
LAURA: Yes, I do.

02:09:52.294 --> 02:09:55.201
MATT: But you're like, you're my quarry, ugh.

02:09:55.201 --> 02:09:56.420
Keeping your eyes back.

02:09:56.420 --> 02:09:58.125
You go ahead and pull your
first and second arrow,

02:09:58.125 --> 02:09:59.657
(imitates bow firing
arrows), letting them loose,

02:09:59.657 --> 02:10:01.476
kind of letting a little bit of faith

02:10:01.476 --> 02:10:02.629
take your arrows to the wind.

02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:04.640
Both finding purchase on your foe.

02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:06.251
LAURA: Can I use bloodseeking bow on that one?

02:10:06.251 --> 02:10:07.084
MATT: You can, yes.

02:10:07.084 --> 02:10:08.304
LAURA: Sweet.

02:10:08.304 --> 02:10:09.471
All right, cool.

02:10:10.561 --> 02:10:12.311
So that's 15, no, 11.

02:10:15.652 --> 02:10:17.233
And then 15.

02:10:17.233 --> 02:10:18.134
(group laughs)

02:10:18.134 --> 02:10:19.447
LAURA: It was good so I kept it.

02:10:19.447 --> 02:10:20.820
TRAVIS: She dropped it, 
but it was a good roll.

02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:22.237
ORION: Yeah, take the drop.

02:10:22.237 --> 02:10:24.963
LAURA: Plus bloodseeking, which is 10 damage,

02:10:24.963 --> 02:10:28.588
plus Hunter's Mark, which
is a six, which is 3.

02:10:28.588 --> 02:10:29.588
MATT: So total damage of...?

02:10:29.588 --> 02:10:31.242
LAURA: Oh, I have to add.

02:10:31.902 --> 02:10:33.028
(Matt laughs)

02:10:33.028 --> 02:10:34.528
LAURA: 15 plus 11 plus 3.

02:10:35.831 --> 02:10:37.933
26, 29 damage.

02:10:37.933 --> 02:10:38.766
MARISHA: Woo!

02:10:38.766 --> 02:10:39.599
MATT: Nice!

02:10:39.599 --> 02:10:40.836
(Liam imitates arrows firing)

02:10:40.836 --> 02:10:42.755
MATT: So, as your arrows sink into him,

02:10:42.755 --> 02:10:44.125
one blasts into him.

02:10:44.125 --> 02:10:46.097
Fire cascades up the side,
you can see the middle

02:10:46.097 --> 02:10:47.863
of its plates beginning to burn

02:10:47.863 --> 02:10:50.280
and torch the cinderous glow.

02:10:50.820 --> 02:10:53.820
It reels back, gets its claws ready,

02:10:54.821 --> 02:10:56.225
now fixated on you 'cause you

02:10:56.225 --> 02:10:57.582
just announced your presence to it.

02:10:57.582 --> 02:10:58.899
LAURA: I'm looking again, so.

02:10:58.899 --> 02:11:00.157
MATT: All right.

02:11:00.157 --> 02:11:02.599
Anything you wanna do with...?

02:11:02.599 --> 02:11:03.432
LAURA: Trinket?

02:11:03.432 --> 02:11:04.265
MATT: Trinket.

02:11:04.265 --> 02:11:05.232
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

02:11:05.232 --> 02:11:07.444
Can he run up and attack the other one?

02:11:07.444 --> 02:11:08.885
While keeping his eyes down?

02:11:08.885 --> 02:11:11.041
MATT: He would have to use one
of your attacks to do that.

02:11:11.041 --> 02:11:13.386
LAURA: Oh okay, well then he's just
hanging out.

02:11:13.386 --> 02:11:14.729
MATT: Trinket's just hanging out.

02:11:14.729 --> 02:11:15.978
LAURA: He's protecting Scanlan.

02:11:15.978 --> 02:11:17.111
(Matt imitates bear growling)

02:11:17.111 --> 02:11:18.384
Yeah, big old bear protecting your gnome.

02:11:18.384 --> 02:11:19.730
LAURA: Protect the gnome!

02:11:19.730 --> 02:11:20.563
LIAM: Gnome coverage.

02:11:20.563 --> 02:11:21.576
[Marisha And Taliesin] Gnome coverage.

02:11:21.579 --> 02:11:23.462
MATT: No healer this week.
What could possibly go wrong?

02:11:23.462 --> 02:11:24.711
MARISHA: Gnomewatch 2015.

02:11:24.711 --> 02:11:25.972
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

02:11:25.972 --> 02:11:27.550
SAM: Scanlan.

02:11:27.550 --> 02:11:29.048
LIAM: Ride the bear, Scanlan.

02:11:29.048 --> 02:11:30.245
SAM: Ride the bear.

02:11:30.245 --> 02:11:31.699
TRAVIS: Oh my God.

02:11:31.699 --> 02:11:35.004
SAM: I will just step forward a little,

02:11:35.004 --> 02:11:38.587
and I will cast polymorph
on our big friend

02:11:38.587 --> 02:11:40.385
that we're surrounding.

02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:44.404
And I'll turn him into a snail.

02:11:44.404 --> 02:11:45.460
MARISHA: A snail? Aww!

02:11:45.460 --> 02:11:46.293
MATT: All right.

02:11:46.293 --> 02:11:47.586
TRAVIS: Can you do that?!

02:11:47.586 --> 02:11:48.419
SAM: Yes.

02:11:48.792 --> 02:11:51.337
MATT: What's the DC, the difficulty
class on your spells?

02:11:51.337 --> 02:11:54.319
SAM: Through the horn of clarity or whatever.

02:11:54.319 --> 02:11:55.291
So it's 17.

02:11:55.291 --> 02:11:56.379
MATT: 17, alright.

02:11:56.379 --> 02:11:58.427
SAM: Or no, 19, sorry, 19.

02:11:58.427 --> 02:11:59.260
MATT: 19.

02:11:59.260 --> 02:12:00.506
SAM: It's plus two.

02:12:00.506 --> 02:12:02.722
MATT: So, as the two umber hulks are there,

02:12:02.722 --> 02:12:05.419
the one that's in the center
of the group, (snarls).

02:12:05.419 --> 02:12:06.615
LAURA: Oh, Tiberius.

02:12:06.615 --> 02:12:08.934
LAURA: Rears back, beginning to
unleash its series of attacks,

02:12:08.934 --> 02:12:10.486
and then (sharp hiss),

02:12:10.486 --> 02:12:11.405
into this tiny--

02:12:11.405 --> 02:12:12.548
TRAVIS: What?!

02:12:12.548 --> 02:12:14.255
MATT: --snail form on the ground.

02:12:14.255 --> 02:12:15.081
LAURA: Awesome!

02:12:15.081 --> 02:12:16.641
LIAM: Don't touch the snail until the--

02:12:16.641 --> 02:12:17.474
LAURA: Why?

02:12:17.474 --> 02:12:20.127
LIAM: 'Cause he'll poof out into
the fucking big guy again.

02:12:20.127 --> 02:12:20.960
SAM: Don't hurt the snail.

02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:21.966
LIAM: Leave it, leave it.

02:12:21.966 --> 02:12:23.965
SAM: Don't pick up the snail.
Just be nice to the snail.

02:12:23.965 --> 02:12:25.594
LIAM: Leave it alone.
Hit the other one.

02:12:25.594 --> 02:12:27.357
ORION: Don't do anything.
I'll take care of the snail.

02:12:27.357 --> 02:12:28.610
(talking over each other)

02:12:28.610 --> 02:12:31.043
MATT: There's a tiny, tiny little
snail on the ground now

02:12:31.043 --> 02:12:32.701
that looks very confused.

02:12:32.701 --> 02:12:33.950
LAURA: That's confusing.

02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:36.617
MATT: Very confused, which is
ironic for an umber hulk,

02:12:36.617 --> 02:12:37.786
to feel confused.

02:12:37.786 --> 02:12:39.503
SAM: As a bonus action,
I give dice to--

02:12:39.503 --> 02:12:42.307
who's coming up next?
Who's coming up soon?

02:12:42.307 --> 02:12:43.808
MATT: Next'll be Percy.

02:12:43.808 --> 02:12:45.585
SAM: Percy, you get dice.

02:12:45.585 --> 02:12:47.122
TALIESIN: What dice do I get?

02:12:47.122 --> 02:12:47.955
MATT: d8.

02:12:47.955 --> 02:12:49.291
SAM: A d8 for inspiration.

02:12:49.291 --> 02:12:51.057
TALIESIN: A d8? All right. Excellent.

02:12:51.057 --> 02:12:51.890
MATT: Percy, you're up.

02:12:51.890 --> 02:12:53.726
(Sam imitates flutes)
Gotta do my app.

02:12:53.726 --> 02:12:55.243
MATT: Do your app, fuck it up.

02:12:55.243 --> 02:12:56.374
ORION: Do the app.

02:12:56.374 --> 02:12:57.517
SAM: No, it's not ready.

02:12:57.517 --> 02:12:58.640
(group laughs)

02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:01.703
TALIESIN: I'm gonna take one of my
two actions to clear my gun.

02:13:01.703 --> 02:13:02.703
TRAVIS: Yeah, the jam.

02:13:02.703 --> 02:13:03.676
TALIESIN: Clear the jam.

02:13:03.676 --> 02:13:04.909
And then set up for a fire shot.

02:13:04.909 --> 02:13:06.440
And I'm gonna take a fire shot.

02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:08.121
Am I at a disadvantage?

02:13:08.121 --> 02:13:11.493
(tinny electronic music)

02:13:11.493 --> 02:13:12.577
MATT: You're inspired.

02:13:12.577 --> 02:13:14.038
SAM: It's so weak, it's so weak.

02:13:14.038 --> 02:13:15.089
TRAVIS: You've gotta get it better.

02:13:15.089 --> 02:13:16.223
MATT: So, who are you shooting?

02:13:16.223 --> 02:13:18.543
TALIESIN: I'm shooting our friend over there.

02:13:18.543 --> 02:13:20.827
I've just sort of turned, and I'm firing.

02:13:20.827 --> 02:13:22.670
TALIESIN: So am I at a disadvantage?

02:13:22.670 --> 02:13:23.951
MATT: Averting your gaze?

02:13:23.951 --> 02:13:27.418
TALIESIN: I'm averting my gaze, but
I know where it is.

02:13:27.418 --> 02:13:30.051
MATT: Right. So go ahead 
and fire at disadvantage.

02:13:30.051 --> 02:13:32.074
SAM: You got the dice, you got the dice.

02:13:32.074 --> 02:13:33.129
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:13:38.411 --> 02:13:40.644
14 with the disadvantage.

02:13:40.644 --> 02:13:43.507
MATT: 14 with the disadvantage
will miss, unfortunately.

02:13:43.507 --> 02:13:44.496
(imitates gun firing)

02:13:44.496 --> 02:13:46.467
The fire shot arcs off into the distance--

02:13:46.467 --> 02:13:47.810
TALIESIN: Oh oh, actually--

02:13:47.810 --> 02:13:49.399
MARISHA: Oh yeah, inspiration.

02:13:49.399 --> 02:13:51.483
MATT: Add the inspiration dice.

02:13:51.483 --> 02:13:52.382
TALIESIN: 17.

02:13:52.382 --> 02:13:53.714
MATT: 17 will just barely hit.

02:13:53.714 --> 02:13:56.043
(group cheers)

02:13:56.043 --> 02:13:58.659
TALIESIN: Well done, well done, ha ha!

02:13:58.659 --> 02:13:59.492
ORION: Good shot!

02:13:59.492 --> 02:14:00.748
LIAM: Good stunt work, Tiberius.

02:14:00.748 --> 02:14:04.128
TALIESIN: So, that's gonna do--
ba-bumpa-bum.

02:14:04.128 --> 02:14:06.893
ORION: I have to wait to figure
out when to open which one.

02:14:06.893 --> 02:14:11.553
TALIESIN: That's 17 fire damage,
17 fire damage.

02:14:11.553 --> 02:14:13.674
MATT: 17 fire damage, nice.

02:14:13.674 --> 02:14:15.977
Okay, you hear the shot hit,

02:14:15.977 --> 02:14:19.625
and you hear a cracking
sound as one of its plates

02:14:19.625 --> 02:14:22.041
actually freezes and
shatters off of its body,

02:14:22.041 --> 02:14:23.967
exposing kind of a fleshy undercarriage.

02:14:23.967 --> 02:14:24.848
MARISHA: Nice.

02:14:24.848 --> 02:14:26.012
[Orion And Marisha] Undercarriage.

02:14:26.012 --> 02:14:28.115
MATT: This umber hulk is starting
to look a little rough.

02:14:28.115 --> 02:14:29.845
That brings us to the top of--

02:14:29.845 --> 02:14:31.396
Do you want to move 
or stay where you are?

02:14:31.396 --> 02:14:33.769
TALIESIN: I'm going to step back to--

02:14:33.769 --> 02:14:37.388
bring me back two to three
steps, just like, back away.

02:14:37.388 --> 02:14:38.221
MATT: Back here.

02:14:38.221 --> 02:14:39.054
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:14:39.054 --> 02:14:39.887
Just like, here.

02:14:39.887 --> 02:14:41.330
LAURA: Avoid the snail.

02:14:41.333 --> 02:14:42.992
SAM: Yeah, don't step on the snail.

02:14:42.992 --> 02:14:44.707
TALIESIN: I'm not stepping on the snail.

02:14:44.707 --> 02:14:46.130
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's good.

02:14:46.130 --> 02:14:47.416
MATT: There? Okay, good.

02:14:47.416 --> 02:14:48.899
All right, that brings us to--

02:14:48.899 --> 02:14:49.772
LAURA: I'm using it!

02:14:49.775 --> 02:14:51.128
MATT: Laser pointers, we have use.

02:14:51.128 --> 02:14:51.961
Keyleth, you're up.

02:14:51.961 --> 02:14:55.878
KEYLETH Okay, after seeing Grog
get confused, I turn,

02:14:57.203 --> 02:15:02.263
and I go straight for his throat.

02:15:02.263 --> 02:15:06.487
And I'm trying to drag him into the creek.

02:15:06.487 --> 02:15:07.320
TRAVIS and LAURA: Ooh.

02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:08.153
MATT: Okay.

02:15:08.153 --> 02:15:09.586
MARISHA: I wanna take the umber hulk

02:15:09.586 --> 02:15:11.299
into the creek right behind me.

02:15:11.299 --> 02:15:13.328
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll for a grapple.

02:15:13.328 --> 02:15:14.396
MARISHA: All right.

02:15:14.396 --> 02:15:15.549
TRAVIS: Come on, cave bear.

02:15:15.549 --> 02:15:18.321
MARISHA: How do I grapple as a bear?

02:15:18.321 --> 02:15:20.048
LIAM: Bear hug, man, bear hug.

02:15:20.048 --> 02:15:21.477
LAURA: Yeah, just take him.

02:15:21.477 --> 02:15:23.870
TALIESIN: How does one grapple as a bear?

02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:24.306
It is a strength check, I guess.

02:15:24.306 --> 02:15:25.462
MATT: Does anyone else--

02:15:25.462 --> 02:15:26.771
Can I have the book real fast?

02:15:26.771 --> 02:15:28.684
Just to be sure we know
how we're doing this.

02:15:28.684 --> 02:15:30.782
TALIESIN: Have you noticed
there's a rhinoceros in here?

02:15:30.782 --> 02:15:32.195
MARISHA: I can be a a rhinoceros.

02:15:32.195 --> 02:15:33.198
MATT: It's a contest, yes.

02:15:33.199 --> 02:15:34.312
TRAVIS: Why have you not been
a rhinoceros yet?

02:15:34.312 --> 02:15:35.956
MARISHA: It just hasn't been useful yet.

02:15:35.956 --> 02:15:37.599
SAM: She usually picks a bird of some sort.

02:15:37.599 --> 02:15:38.772
MARISHA: I'm waiting for the right time.

02:15:38.772 --> 02:15:40.583
LIAM: She can only turn into
things she's seen.

02:15:40.583 --> 02:15:41.980
SAM: I'm a squirrel and a bird!

02:15:41.980 --> 02:15:43.951
You should be a rhinoceros.

02:15:43.951 --> 02:15:47.281
TALIESIN: We're just waiting for you to
scream, "It's morphin time!"

02:15:47.281 --> 02:15:48.792
It's morphing time!
Bear!

02:15:48.792 --> 02:15:51.442
MARISHA: Oh my god, can you make me
smoke bombs that smoke,

02:15:51.442 --> 02:15:53.142
and I say, "It's morphin time"?

02:15:53.142 --> 02:15:55.845
MATT: So you can make a grapple attempt
in place of one of your attacks.

02:15:55.845 --> 02:15:57.768
MARISHA: Okay.
That's what I want to do.

02:15:57.768 --> 02:15:58.601
MATT: All right.

02:15:58.601 --> 02:16:00.634
MARISHA: So I just strength check then?

02:16:00.634 --> 02:16:02.394
MATT: So it is an athletics check.

02:16:02.908 --> 02:16:05.832
MARISHA: Oh. I don't have stats, I'm a bear.

02:16:05.832 --> 02:16:07.605
MATT: No, you use the bear's stats.

02:16:07.605 --> 02:16:10.452
MARISHA: But all I have are the basic six.

02:16:10.452 --> 02:16:11.704
MATT: Right, what's the strength?

02:16:11.704 --> 02:16:12.537
MARISHA: Five.

02:16:12.537 --> 02:16:13.370
MATT: Yeah.

02:16:13.370 --> 02:16:14.203
MARISHA: So that's what I do.

02:16:14.203 --> 02:16:15.557
MATT: Yeah, roll the dice, add plus five.

02:16:15.557 --> 02:16:17.236
(group cheers)

02:16:17.236 --> 02:16:18.090
ORION: It's 20!

02:16:18.090 --> 02:16:19.112
MATT: Natural 20.

02:16:19.112 --> 02:16:21.461
(clapping)

02:16:21.461 --> 02:16:23.338
You reach forward and latch onto it

02:16:23.338 --> 02:16:26.058
with your claws and your teeth,
onto the umber hulk.

02:16:26.058 --> 02:16:27.591
MARISHA: Going for the throat.

02:16:27.591 --> 02:16:28.689
MATT: Alright.

02:16:28.689 --> 02:16:29.884
So that's your first attack.

02:16:29.884 --> 02:16:31.276
You can go ahead while it's grappled

02:16:31.276 --> 02:16:32.698
and attack with the other strikes.

02:16:32.698 --> 02:16:35.294
MARISHA: I'm taking him underwater.

02:16:35.294 --> 02:16:36.406
MATT: Okay.

02:16:36.406 --> 02:16:37.294
You pull.

02:16:37.294 --> 02:16:38.127
LAURA: Oh god, you're doing it, Keyleth.

02:16:38.127 --> 02:16:40.324
MARISHA: Pulling him underwater.

02:16:40.324 --> 02:16:41.156
LIAM: It's a waterfall, oh.

02:16:41.156 --> 02:16:42.721
MATT: (imitates thudding) You both plunge

02:16:42.721 --> 02:16:44.377
underneath the water's surface.

02:16:44.377 --> 02:16:46.540
Take a big old breath right beforehand,

02:16:46.540 --> 02:16:47.723
and I'm going underwater.

02:16:47.723 --> 02:16:50.176
ORION: Wait, can you let him
go and let him drown?

02:16:50.176 --> 02:16:52.077
LAURA: Yeah, let him go, 'cause it's a waterfall.

02:16:52.077 --> 02:16:53.863
MARISHA: No, I'm holding on to him.

02:16:53.863 --> 02:16:55.364
LAURA: But Keyleth, there's a waterfall.

02:16:55.364 --> 02:16:56.778
It's fine.

02:16:56.778 --> 02:16:58.138
MATT: It's now its turn.

02:16:58.138 --> 02:17:00.308
It's going to try
and break your grapple.

02:17:00.308 --> 02:17:02.439
MATT: Make an athletics check.

02:17:02.439 --> 02:17:04.263
MARISHA: Against his strength, I guess.

02:17:04.263 --> 02:17:05.617
Ah, 20.

02:17:05.617 --> 02:17:06.450
MATT: 20, okay.

02:17:06.450 --> 02:17:07.974
You maintain your grip on the umber hulk.

02:17:07.974 --> 02:17:09.580
It's thrashing in the
water trying to get its way

02:17:09.580 --> 02:17:11.401
to the surface. (snarls)

02:17:11.401 --> 02:17:13.218
Still slashing about.

02:17:13.218 --> 02:17:15.859
So it's gonna make its
attacks against you.

02:17:15.859 --> 02:17:16.941
MATT: That is a 14.

02:17:18.097 --> 02:17:19.441
MARISHA: Hits.

02:17:19.441 --> 02:17:20.809
MATT: 14 hits you?

02:17:20.809 --> 02:17:23.495
MARISHA: I'm a bear, my armor
class is 12 right now.

02:17:23.495 --> 02:17:25.249
MATT: Well no, you keep your armor class.

02:17:25.249 --> 02:17:26.892
MARISHA: I keep my armor class?

02:17:26.892 --> 02:17:28.059
MATT: I'm pretty sure.

02:17:28.059 --> 02:17:29.398
LIAM: Yes, the answer to that is yes.

02:17:29.398 --> 02:17:30.232
TRAVIS: Yeah, you do.

02:17:30.232 --> 02:17:31.315
LIAM: Definitely yes.

02:17:31.315 --> 02:17:33.477
MATT: Nah, let's see real fast
actually on this one.

02:17:33.477 --> 02:17:35.932
SAM: Keep subscribing
to Geek &amp;amp; Sundry everybody.

02:17:35.932 --> 02:17:36.764
MATT: Exactly.

02:17:36.764 --> 02:17:40.018
SAM: We're going for 1200 subscribers tonight,

02:17:40.018 --> 02:17:41.535
and if we reach that number...

02:17:42.558 --> 02:17:43.485
good for you.

02:17:43.485 --> 02:17:45.789
(group laughs)

02:17:45.789 --> 02:17:46.910
MATT: Here we go.

02:17:46.910 --> 02:17:49.218
LIAM: Sam will write a ballad.

02:17:49.218 --> 02:17:50.052
SAM: I will.

02:17:50.052 --> 02:17:51.885
MATT: You gain the scores--

02:17:56.460 --> 02:17:58.585
SAM: By the way, this music is just great.

02:17:58.585 --> 02:18:00.369
MATT: It's 12 plus-- it's whatever the 12 is,

02:18:00.369 --> 02:18:02.468
plus your proficiency modifier,
I think is what it is.

02:18:02.468 --> 02:18:04.718
For now, we'll say it hits.

02:18:05.973 --> 02:18:07.644
'Cause I don't wanna hold this up.

02:18:07.644 --> 02:18:09.562
TALIESIN: There once was a player--

02:18:09.562 --> 02:18:10.712
SAM: In Nantucket?

02:18:10.712 --> 02:18:11.818
LAURA: Don't.

02:18:11.818 --> 02:18:13.800
MATT: No, you gain its armor class.

02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:14.773
MARISHA: I do gain its armor class.

02:18:14.773 --> 02:18:15.607
MATT: Yeah, you do.

02:18:15.607 --> 02:18:16.580
MARISHA: So it hits.

02:18:16.580 --> 02:18:17.986
MATT: Yeah, it hits you.
All right.

02:18:17.986 --> 02:18:18.939
Second strike.

02:18:18.939 --> 02:18:21.469
That's also gonna hit you.

02:18:21.469 --> 02:18:22.831
All three hit you.

02:18:22.831 --> 02:18:26.081
You take six points of slashing damage.

02:18:27.768 --> 02:18:30.184
11 points of slashing damage.

02:18:31.486 --> 02:18:32.654
And 6, 11, 17--

02:18:35.468 --> 02:18:36.300
MARISHA: It's okay guys.

02:18:36.300 --> 02:18:37.805
MATT: Total of 26 points of slashing damage.

02:18:37.805 --> 02:18:39.922
MARISHA: I am no longer a bear.

02:18:39.922 --> 02:18:42.315
MATT: So you lose your grip
as your form reverts.

02:18:42.315 --> 02:18:45.673
You are now back to
Keyleth's form in the water.

02:18:45.673 --> 02:18:48.673
SAM: And you're in the water!

02:18:48.673 --> 02:18:51.359
MARISHA: Can I cast a concentration
spell on myself?

02:18:51.359 --> 02:18:54.418
MATT: No, because you used your
actions to grapple it.

02:18:54.418 --> 02:18:55.251
MARISHA: And that's it.

02:18:55.251 --> 02:18:59.019
MATT: So you're now just back in
the Keyleth form, underwater.

02:18:59.019 --> 02:19:00.947
You catch your breath and
realize you're now underwater

02:19:00.947 --> 02:19:03.519
in near darkness with an
umber hulk right on you.

02:19:03.519 --> 02:19:04.862
MARISHA: Hey brah. Sup?

02:19:04.862 --> 02:19:06.055
Fancy meeting you here.

02:19:06.055 --> 02:19:07.123
MATT: Vax, you're up.

02:19:07.123 --> 02:19:08.626
LIAM: Okay, so first thing I do is lean down

02:19:08.626 --> 02:19:10.816
and pick up the snail
off the ground and say,

02:19:10.816 --> 02:19:12.862
"Hey, um, go fuck yourself."

02:19:12.862 --> 02:19:14.785
And then I throw him into the waterfall.

02:19:14.785 --> 02:19:15.618
SAM: Oh Jesus!

02:19:15.618 --> 02:19:16.811
MATT: Over here?

02:19:16.811 --> 02:19:17.644
LIAM: Yeah.

02:19:17.644 --> 02:19:18.477
MATT: All right.

02:19:18.477 --> 02:19:19.517
Go ahead and roll a ranged attack.

02:19:19.517 --> 02:19:21.029
So just roll, add dexterity.

02:19:21.029 --> 02:19:21.861
LIAM: Okay.

02:19:21.861 --> 02:19:22.977
LAURA: Oh gosh, okay okay.

02:19:22.977 --> 02:19:24.397
LIAM: Great great great.

02:19:24.397 --> 02:19:25.484
Dexterity you say? 18.

02:19:25.484 --> 02:19:26.300
MATT: 18?

02:19:26.300 --> 02:19:27.891
LAURA: No, it's higher than that, yo!

02:19:27.891 --> 02:19:29.564
ORION: No, it's fine if he drowns and dies.

02:19:29.564 --> 02:19:32.115
LIAM: Oh sorry, yeah, that's 21.

02:19:33.014 --> 02:19:33.848
22, 22.

02:19:33.848 --> 02:19:36.014
MATT: You throw, it arcs over.

02:19:37.189 --> 02:19:39.238
Lands in the water.

02:19:39.238 --> 02:19:41.798
(imitates water sucking)
Goes under into the waterfall.

02:19:41.798 --> 02:19:43.020
LIAM: Toodle-oo shitface.

02:19:43.020 --> 02:19:45.762
SAM: Hey wait, he (stutters) he swam away?

02:19:45.762 --> 02:19:48.741
MATT: No, he threw the snail over the waterfall.

02:19:48.741 --> 02:19:49.647
SAM: Hey!
Bye-bye!

02:19:50.270 --> 02:19:52.548
LIAM: Now, that seems like a
bonus action to me, right?

02:19:52.548 --> 02:19:53.409
(group laughs)

02:19:53.409 --> 02:19:54.242
MATT: That's an attack.

02:19:54.242 --> 02:19:57.213
LIAM: So then that's an attack, okay.

02:19:57.213 --> 02:19:58.752
MARISHA: (laughs) That's an attack.

02:19:58.752 --> 02:20:00.763
MATT: It's the world's easiest grapple throw.

02:20:00.763 --> 02:20:01.965
TRAVIS: You threw him forever.

02:20:01.965 --> 02:20:02.996
LIAM: Then I'm good.

02:20:02.996 --> 02:20:03.829
LAURA: That's it?

02:20:03.829 --> 02:20:06.589
LIAM: Well, that's my action, right?

02:20:06.589 --> 02:20:07.422
MATT: Correct.

02:20:07.422 --> 02:20:08.685
LIAM: And I only have one.

02:20:08.685 --> 02:20:10.189
SAM: You can move, you can move.

02:20:10.189 --> 02:20:11.683
LIAM: All right, so then,

02:20:11.683 --> 02:20:15.131
I'll hop through, through
Percy and my sister.

02:20:15.131 --> 02:20:18.120
And run up behind the shithead
who's fucking with Keyleth.

02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:21.163
MATT: Make an acrobatics check,
try to tumble through them.

02:20:21.163 --> 02:20:22.406
LIAM: Yeah, that's easy.

02:20:22.445 --> 02:20:23.618
ORION: He's in the water, though.

02:20:23.618 --> 02:20:24.796
LIAM: 16 (mumbles) 29.

02:20:24.796 --> 02:20:26.319
MATT: Yeah, you're fine, and
where do you wanna go?

02:20:26.319 --> 02:20:29.148
LIAM: Right up behind shitface there.

02:20:29.148 --> 02:20:30.857
And do I have anything left?

02:20:30.857 --> 02:20:33.570
Or do I just get there and stop.

02:20:33.570 --> 02:20:34.664
MATT: Well, it was the attack to throw it.

02:20:34.664 --> 02:20:35.497
You would have your second off-hand.

02:20:35.497 --> 02:20:36.330
LIAM: Second attack.

02:20:36.330 --> 02:20:37.462
Well let's stab him in
the ass then, right.

02:20:37.462 --> 02:20:39.665
MATT: Well, you have disadvantage
'cause it's currently

02:20:39.665 --> 02:20:40.968
in the water thrashing about,

02:20:40.968 --> 02:20:43.020
and it's hard to see.

02:20:43.020 --> 02:20:45.437
Well, that's not very good.

02:20:45.437 --> 02:20:47.022
15.

02:20:47.022 --> 02:20:48.172
MATT: 15 misses unfortunately.

02:20:48.172 --> 02:20:50.569
So as you slash down with
your dagger into the water,

02:20:50.569 --> 02:20:52.231
it's just too hard to really make out

02:20:52.231 --> 02:20:53.927
what that form moving is.

02:20:53.927 --> 02:20:55.912
LIAM: I still feel pretty good about that round.

02:20:55.912 --> 02:20:57.540
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was pretty good.

02:20:57.540 --> 02:20:58.683
MATT: Grog, you're up.

02:20:58.683 --> 02:20:59.706
TRAVIS: Am I? (grunts)

02:20:59.706 --> 02:21:02.012
With my frenzied rage renewed,

02:21:02.012 --> 02:21:05.890
I run towards the water,
haunted by nightmares

02:21:05.890 --> 02:21:07.867
of Sebastian in the Little Mermaid,

02:21:07.867 --> 02:21:12.860
and I leap into the water and
start slashing and slashing.

02:21:12.860 --> 02:21:13.693
MATT: Go ahead and make your
three attacks, Grog.

02:21:13.693 --> 02:21:16.124
(Liam sings opening
notes to "Under the Sea")

02:21:16.124 --> 02:21:19.266
TRAVIS: ♫ Le poisson, le poisson,
hee hee hee, fuck you bitch ♫

02:21:19.266 --> 02:21:20.822
(Matt laughs)

02:21:20.822 --> 02:21:24.989
TRAVIS: 18 plus... that's 26.

02:21:25.374 --> 02:21:26.418
MATT: 26 hits.

02:21:26.418 --> 02:21:27.251
TRAVIS: Okay, good.
Second attack.

02:21:27.785 --> 02:21:28.618
26.

02:21:28.618 --> 02:21:29.451
MATT: Hits.

02:21:31.580 --> 02:21:32.927
TRAVIS: Okay. 25.

02:21:32.927 --> 02:21:33.760
MATT: Hits.

02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:34.593
TRAVIS: Good.

02:21:34.593 --> 02:21:35.828
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage, Grog.

02:21:35.828 --> 02:21:37.658
As you come charging
forward, just (grunts),

02:21:37.658 --> 02:21:40.322
leaving bits of foam cascading
off the side of your mouth.

02:21:40.322 --> 02:21:42.676
Your eyes just glazed over with white.

02:21:42.676 --> 02:21:44.273
You bring the axe down into the water,

02:21:44.273 --> 02:21:46.218
form towards where the splashing is.

02:21:46.218 --> 02:21:50.305
Keeping mindful that Keyleth
might be in there somewhere.

02:21:50.305 --> 02:21:53.627
But you're very much see the
larger form in the field, so.

02:21:53.627 --> 02:21:56.564
TRAVIS: It's all about sushi right?
MARISHA: Oh, I'm fine.

02:21:56.564 --> 02:21:58.883
MATT: Yeah, so damage on the first strike?

02:21:58.883 --> 02:22:01.050
TRAVIS: Eight, second one is 16.

02:22:01.050 --> 02:22:03.074
MATT: Eight, 16, that's 24.

02:22:03.074 --> 02:22:04.491
TRAVIS: And 17, thirty.

02:22:05.475 --> 02:22:07.581
What's 24 plus 10?

02:22:07.581 --> 02:22:08.414
LAURA AND MATT: 34.

02:22:09.794 --> 02:22:10.646
MATT: Grog.

02:22:10.646 --> 02:22:12.313
34 points of damage.

02:22:13.728 --> 02:22:16.640
As your axe comes down,
slam once into the water.

02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:18.554
You see one of the claws
start pulling itself up

02:22:18.554 --> 02:22:19.678
out of the surface.

02:22:19.678 --> 02:22:21.048
It's head's still under the water.

02:22:21.048 --> 02:22:22.047
You slam the axe down.

02:22:22.047 --> 02:22:24.490
You see the arm actually snaps

02:22:24.490 --> 02:22:25.624
and begins to drift down the river.

02:22:25.624 --> 02:22:28.107
As it looks up at you, its eyes open.

02:22:28.107 --> 02:22:30.322
Before the gaze can meet
yours, the axe comes down

02:22:30.322 --> 02:22:32.446
and plunges itself
directly into the forehead

02:22:32.446 --> 02:22:36.819
of the umber hulk with a
shunk sound.

02:22:36.819 --> 02:22:40.053
As it does, its body goes limp and begins
to float down the water.

02:22:40.053 --> 02:22:42.420
(group cheers and claps)

02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:45.353
LAURA: Well, that was easy.

02:22:46.358 --> 02:22:47.569
SAM: Was it?

02:22:47.569 --> 02:22:51.160
LAURA: I walk up and try to help
Keyleth out of the water.

02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:51.993
MATT: Okay.

02:22:52.832 --> 02:22:55.832
You help Keyleth out of the water.

02:22:58.177 --> 02:23:01.482
At this point, the snail form,

02:23:01.482 --> 02:23:02.747
which doesn't have a
whole lot of hit points,

02:23:02.747 --> 02:23:05.555
has taken enough damage
to alleviate itself

02:23:05.555 --> 02:23:07.138
from the polymorph.

02:23:08.110 --> 02:23:10.958
As the spell fades, as the
snail form is destroyed,

02:23:10.958 --> 02:23:13.793
the other umber hulk
begins clawing its way

02:23:13.793 --> 02:23:15.422
up the side of the mountain,

02:23:15.422 --> 02:23:17.281
burrows through the actual stonework--

02:23:17.281 --> 02:23:18.481
LAURA: Ah, balls.

02:23:18.481 --> 02:23:20.497
MATT: --(imitates explosion) and
bursts out of the ground

02:23:20.497 --> 02:23:22.010
right behind you, Vax.

02:23:22.010 --> 02:23:22.925
(imitates explosion)

02:23:22.925 --> 02:23:24.126
VAX: Oh, fuck a duck.

02:23:24.126 --> 02:23:25.416
TRAVIS: Come on, drop this thing.

02:23:25.416 --> 02:23:27.183
LAURA: This is why you shouldn't
have thrown the snail.

02:23:27.183 --> 02:23:28.938
MATT: But that's its turn.

02:23:28.938 --> 02:23:31.345
LIAM: I thought it would get
washed all the way out.

02:23:31.345 --> 02:23:33.950
Down the toilet, all the way out.

02:23:33.950 --> 02:23:35.593
MATT: All right, that brings us
to the top of the round.

02:23:35.593 --> 02:23:36.459
Tiberius.

02:23:36.459 --> 02:23:38.018
MARISHA: It was at least badass.

02:23:38.018 --> 02:23:39.061
LIAM: Elegant.

02:23:39.061 --> 02:23:40.180
MARISHA: It was very elegant.

02:23:40.180 --> 02:23:41.873
TALIESIN: I'm sure it was 
a wonderful thought.

02:23:41.873 --> 02:23:42.977
ORION: Firebolt.

02:23:42.977 --> 02:23:44.163
MATT: Okay, roll for it.

02:23:44.163 --> 02:23:45.344
Roll for the attacks.

02:23:45.637 --> 02:23:47.205
LIAM: Just past it, please.

02:23:47.205 --> 02:23:49.324
MATT: Yep, any directed spell like that

02:23:49.324 --> 02:23:52.161
you have to roll and add
your spell range modifier.

02:23:52.161 --> 02:23:54.050
ORION: Sweet, that does not hit.

02:23:54.050 --> 02:23:54.883
MATT: What'd you roll?

02:23:54.883 --> 02:23:55.716
ORION: Uh, 11.

02:23:57.697 --> 02:23:59.026
MATT: Disadvantage, so.

02:23:59.026 --> 02:23:59.859
You rolled an 11 total?

02:23:59.859 --> 02:24:00.758
ORION: 10.

02:24:00.758 --> 02:24:02.269
MATT: Yeah, you miss.

02:24:02.269 --> 02:24:05.312
So, as you aim your firebolt
(imitated fire shooting)

02:24:05.312 --> 02:24:06.842
You're just averting your gaze,

02:24:06.842 --> 02:24:09.344
and it jumps over and arcs
through the rest of the carvern,

02:24:09.344 --> 02:24:12.432
lighting it as it goes like a flare.

02:24:12.432 --> 02:24:13.475
ORION: Good cavern.

02:24:13.475 --> 02:24:14.987
MATT: That leads to Scanlan.

02:24:14.987 --> 02:24:15.794
SAM: Scanlan?

02:24:15.794 --> 02:24:16.936
MATT: Actually no, Vex is up
and then Scanlan, sorry.

02:24:16.936 --> 02:24:17.769
LAURA: Me?

02:24:17.769 --> 02:24:18.721
MATT: You, you.

02:24:18.721 --> 02:24:20.242
LIAM: Kill it before it kills me.

02:24:20.242 --> 02:24:21.075
Okay.

02:24:21.075 --> 02:24:23.617
LAURA: I am gonna keep my gaze
averted, but I just heard it,

02:24:23.617 --> 02:24:24.450
and I'm gonna--

02:24:24.450 --> 02:24:26.422
ORION: That rhymed.

02:24:26.422 --> 02:24:28.604
LAURA: I'm gonna attack it.
WIth some arrows.

02:24:28.604 --> 02:24:29.387
MATT: Go for it.

02:24:29.387 --> 02:24:31.907
So two arrows, notched.
(imitates arrows firing)

02:24:31.907 --> 02:24:33.299
Disadvantage on each attack.

02:24:33.299 --> 02:24:34.374
LAURA: Oh, okay.

02:24:34.374 --> 02:24:35.570
LIAM: Don't let it eat my head, please.

02:24:35.570 --> 02:24:36.536
LAURA: Yeah, it's the same. 18.

02:24:36.536 --> 02:24:37.427
No, lying.

02:24:37.427 --> 02:24:38.260
20.

02:24:38.260 --> 02:24:39.093
MATT: 20 hits.

02:24:39.093 --> 02:24:41.575
Go ahead and roll for the second attack.

02:24:43.458 --> 02:24:45.099
LAURA: 19.

02:24:45.099 --> 02:24:45.932
MATT: Both hit.

02:24:45.932 --> 02:24:46.765
LAURA: Okay, good.

02:24:46.765 --> 02:24:49.419
MATT: Go ahead and
roll damage on each.

02:24:49.419 --> 02:24:52.819
LAURA: Is this the one
that I Hunter's Marked?

02:24:52.819 --> 02:24:53.652
No, the other one Hunter's Marked.

02:24:53.652 --> 02:24:54.550
MATT: The other one was, yeah.

02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:55.495
LAURA: Okay, that's fine.
10 plus 13 is 23.

02:24:55.495 --> 02:24:57.491
MATT: But you could switch
over your hunter's mark.

02:24:57.491 --> 02:24:59.279
LAURA: And I switched over my Hunter's
Mark as my bonus action.

02:24:59.279 --> 02:25:00.324
MATT: With your bonus action.

02:25:00.324 --> 02:25:02.241
LAURA: So I add the-- oh, one.

02:25:03.784 --> 02:25:05.430
MATT: So a total of?

02:25:05.430 --> 02:25:06.263
LAURA: 24.

02:25:06.263 --> 02:25:07.096
MATT: 24 points of damage.

02:25:07.096 --> 02:25:08.426
All right, got you.

02:25:08.426 --> 02:25:10.566
(imitates arrows flying)
The arrows end up piercing

02:25:10.566 --> 02:25:11.399
part of the armor.

02:25:11.399 --> 02:25:14.590
Each sink in a good, solid
six, seven inches or so.

02:25:14.590 --> 02:25:17.498
It angrily (wet snarling) at the impact,

02:25:17.498 --> 02:25:19.749
but it wasn't enough force
to send it back at all.

02:25:19.749 --> 02:25:21.794
But it knows exactly where you are.

02:25:21.794 --> 02:25:23.683
That brings us to Scanlan.

02:25:23.683 --> 02:25:25.732
SAM: Scanlan's gonna move
right in front of where--

02:25:25.732 --> 02:25:27.037
I believe that's Percy?

02:25:27.037 --> 02:25:28.019
LIAM: Save the day, Scanny.

02:25:28.019 --> 02:25:30.459
LAURA: Oh yeah, I should've ran Trinket up there.

02:25:30.459 --> 02:25:32.975
LIAM: Repeat, just like last week.

02:25:34.031 --> 02:25:36.939
SAM: Toss another dice to Percy,
he seems to need them.

02:25:36.939 --> 02:25:37.871
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:25:37.871 --> 02:25:41.477
SAM: And I'm gonna cast
lightning bolt at the thing.

02:25:41.477 --> 02:25:44.062
Who's wet from being in the water, yes?

02:25:44.062 --> 02:25:47.316
So electricity is gonna
be pretty bad on him.

02:25:47.316 --> 02:25:48.149
MATT: All right.

02:25:49.014 --> 02:25:52.123
So, because you're kind of averting
your gaze to look away--

02:25:52.123 --> 02:25:52.956
SAM: Disadvantage.

02:25:52.956 --> 02:25:54.688
MATT: No, because you don't roll to attack.

02:25:54.688 --> 02:25:57.150
But it gets advantage on its saving throw
because of that aspect.

02:25:57.150 --> 02:25:59.910
MATT: So, it rolled natural 20 for its saving,

02:25:59.910 --> 02:26:00.846
so it takes half damage.

02:26:00.846 --> 02:26:02.143
But go ahead and roll your 8d6,

02:26:02.143 --> 02:26:03.300
it's the lighting bolt.

02:26:03.300 --> 02:26:04.133
SAM: 8d6.

02:26:04.133 --> 02:26:04.966
MATT: Arcs out from your fingers.
(imitates lightning)

02:26:04.966 --> 02:26:06.194
SAM: 8d6, 8d6.

02:26:06.194 --> 02:26:07.027
8d6?!

02:26:08.415 --> 02:26:09.248
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:26:09.248 --> 02:26:10.081
SAM: 8?!

02:26:10.081 --> 02:26:10.914
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:26:10.914 --> 02:26:11.747
LIAM: Yes.

02:26:11.747 --> 02:26:12.580
SAM: Shit!

02:26:12.580 --> 02:26:13.514
(group laughs)

02:26:13.514 --> 02:26:16.847
Uh, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

02:26:19.250 --> 02:26:20.623
(group laughs)

02:26:20.623 --> 02:26:23.987
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22 (mutters softly)

02:26:23.987 --> 02:26:24.950
28!

02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:25.783
MATT: 28, okay.

02:26:25.783 --> 02:26:27.248
14 points of damage to the umber hulk

02:26:27.248 --> 02:26:30.409
as the bolt of lightning
cascades through its body.

02:26:30.409 --> 02:26:32.012
It lights up for a second as you see

02:26:32.012 --> 02:26:35.013
the crawling fingers
of electricity kind of

02:26:35.013 --> 02:26:36.102
shoot through its plates.

02:26:36.102 --> 02:26:37.293
SAM: I like crawling fingers.

02:26:37.293 --> 02:26:38.126
MATT: Indeed.

02:26:38.126 --> 02:26:40.100
ORION: That was the name of
the one girl, wasn't it?

02:26:40.100 --> 02:26:41.088
SAM: Yes.

02:26:41.088 --> 02:26:42.901
MARISHA: Oh, I loved Crawline, she was so nice.

02:26:42.901 --> 02:26:44.154
MATT: As the bolt grounds itself,

02:26:44.154 --> 02:26:47.251
the rest of the water on
its form evaporates

02:26:47.251 --> 02:26:49.026
from the sheer force of the electricity.

02:26:49.026 --> 02:26:51.202
You see the umber hulk still standing.

02:26:51.202 --> 02:26:54.632
Angry, in pain, and
standing, although it's still

02:26:54.632 --> 02:26:57.301
looking a little worse for wear.

02:26:57.301 --> 02:26:58.783
You don't wanna do that to an umber hulk.

02:26:58.783 --> 02:27:00.380
(group laughs)

02:27:00.380 --> 02:27:02.045
SAM: You're right.

02:27:02.045 --> 02:27:02.970
MATT: Percy, you're up.

02:27:02.970 --> 02:27:06.383
TALIESIN: Taking my shot, I'm averting my eyes, so.

02:27:06.383 --> 02:27:08.470
SAM: Use those dice, use those dice.

02:27:08.470 --> 02:27:09.532
MARISHA: Whoo!

02:27:09.532 --> 02:27:10.816
TALIESIN: 24 to hit.

02:27:10.816 --> 02:27:11.680
MATT: That was the disadvantage?

02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:12.824
TALIESIN: At the disadvantage.

02:27:12.824 --> 02:27:13.881
MATT: Awesome, that hits.

02:27:13.881 --> 02:27:15.798
TALIESIN: That's 1d8 plus five.

02:27:18.103 --> 02:27:19.885
That's, ugh, that's terrible.

02:27:19.885 --> 02:27:21.845
That's six points of damage.

02:27:21.845 --> 02:27:23.122
I'm taking my second shot.

02:27:23.122 --> 02:27:24.326
MATT: All right.

02:27:24.326 --> 02:27:26.326
LIAM: Shoot it in the mouth.

02:27:27.247 --> 02:27:28.564
(clapping)

02:27:28.564 --> 02:27:30.646
MARISHA: Oh wait, but it's disadvantage.

02:27:30.646 --> 02:27:31.711
TALIESIN: I rolled twice.

02:27:31.711 --> 02:27:33.197
So I rolled a 19 and a 20, which means--

02:27:33.197 --> 02:27:34.297
MARISHA: Which are both your critical, right?

02:27:34.297 --> 02:27:35.130
Which are both my criticals.

02:27:35.963 --> 02:27:36.995
So a critical at a disadvantage.

02:27:36.995 --> 02:27:37.828
TRAVIS: Sick, nasty.

02:27:37.828 --> 02:27:38.661
TALIESIN: Just point, nyah, nyah!

02:27:38.661 --> 02:27:39.877
LIAM: Yes Percy.
Critical on a disadvantage!

02:27:39.877 --> 02:27:40.710
MATT: Well done.

02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:41.939
TALIESIN: So I'm also gonna spend my die.

02:27:41.939 --> 02:27:43.820
LIAM: Whatever your last name is again.

02:27:43.820 --> 02:27:45.130
SAM: The die is for the attack.

02:27:45.130 --> 02:27:47.645
MATT: It's for attacks, skills,
and saving throws,

02:27:47.645 --> 02:27:48.478
not for damage.

02:27:49.432 --> 02:27:50.275
TALIESIN: That's, uh...

02:27:50.275 --> 02:27:53.014
five, six, seven, eight,
that's 11 points of damage.

02:27:53.014 --> 02:27:54.146
TRAVIS: Finish him.

02:27:54.146 --> 02:27:56.215
MATT: 11 points of damage from the first one.

02:27:56.215 --> 02:27:57.914
TALIESIN: 11 points of damage from the second one.

02:27:57.914 --> 02:27:59.768
MARISHA: But that one's critical.

02:27:59.768 --> 02:28:00.892
So it doubles, right?

02:28:01.555 --> 02:28:03.536
TALIESIN: It's just 1d8 becomes 2d8, right?

02:28:03.536 --> 02:28:04.679
MATT: Correct, yeah.

02:28:04.679 --> 02:28:06.047
TALIESIN: Yeah that's-- yeah.

02:28:06.047 --> 02:28:07.944
MATT: Okay, it's 11 points damage.
Gotcha.

02:28:08.777 --> 02:28:11.108
So, as you rear back
your shot (imitates gun firing)

02:28:11.108 --> 02:28:11.941
it resounds.

02:28:11.941 --> 02:28:13.760
It hits the plate, shatters
it on the other side

02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:14.750
of its chest.

02:28:14.750 --> 02:28:16.903
You can now see this
weird purplish goo

02:28:16.903 --> 02:28:18.636
beginning to spill from its wounds.

02:28:18.636 --> 02:28:20.451
You see it's holding itself up,

02:28:20.451 --> 02:28:23.111
and it's having a hard time
keeping physical form there.

02:28:23.111 --> 02:28:24.577
Keyleth, you're up.

02:28:24.577 --> 02:28:25.744
MARISHA: Oh. Um, cool.

02:28:27.513 --> 02:28:28.346
(Liam laughs)

02:28:28.346 --> 02:28:29.179
ORION: Word.

02:28:29.179 --> 02:28:30.012
MARISHA: Word.

02:28:31.152 --> 02:28:32.488
I'm still a person.

02:28:34.295 --> 02:28:36.846
I'm gonna go ahead and also
do a call lighting spell.

02:28:36.846 --> 02:28:39.525
Bam, call lightning right on its head.
'Cause he's wet.

02:28:39.525 --> 02:28:40.997
MATT: Call lighting it is.

02:28:40.997 --> 02:28:43.636
MATT: So, as you begin to complete your spell,

02:28:43.636 --> 02:28:45.221
you can see now the upper arch,

02:28:45.221 --> 02:28:47.837
the 100 foot archway, the
ceiling of this area begins

02:28:47.837 --> 02:28:50.447
to fill with this strange
cloudy, thunderous booms,

02:28:50.447 --> 02:28:53.330
as a raincloud is created
and summoned across the rooftop.

02:28:54.487 --> 02:28:56.665
At which point, Keyleth frees her hand up

02:28:56.665 --> 02:28:59.409
and pulls down as a single
bolt streaks through the air,

02:28:59.409 --> 02:29:01.887
slamming into the same
lightning bolt wound

02:29:01.887 --> 02:29:03.749
that you left previously on it,

02:29:03.749 --> 02:29:06.175
where the edges of its
armor are still glowing

02:29:06.175 --> 02:29:07.112
from the heat.

02:29:07.112 --> 02:29:08.375
Go ahead and roll damage.

02:29:08.375 --> 02:29:09.598
MARISHA: Got him right in the ass.

02:29:10.132 --> 02:29:11.463
It just gets straight damage?

02:29:11.463 --> 02:29:13.779
MATT: Yeah, it gets a bonus on
its saving throw, though.

02:29:13.779 --> 02:29:14.562
Or advantage.

02:29:14.562 --> 02:29:16.191
Which it makes.

02:29:16.191 --> 02:29:17.912
MARISHA: I get 3d10.

02:29:17.912 --> 02:29:18.745
MATT: 3d10.

02:29:18.745 --> 02:29:20.495
All right, go for it.

02:29:21.778 --> 02:29:22.611
MARISHA: 6, 7--

02:29:25.375 --> 02:29:27.318
MATT: It is no longer outdoors-only.

02:29:27.318 --> 02:29:29.428
MATT: It gets a bonus for being outdoors.

02:29:29.428 --> 02:29:30.261
MARISHA: 11 damage.

02:29:30.261 --> 02:29:31.373
MATT: 11 damage to the umber hulk.

02:29:31.373 --> 02:29:32.206
Which is halved.

02:29:32.206 --> 02:29:34.394
He made a saving throw, to a six.

02:29:34.394 --> 02:29:35.715
MARISHA: Saving throw, mm.

02:29:35.715 --> 02:29:36.548
MATT: Yeah.

02:29:36.548 --> 02:29:37.381
TRAVIS: Finish him.

02:29:37.381 --> 02:29:38.319
Cause you're having to avert your gaze.

02:29:38.319 --> 02:29:39.684
You're trying to
work out this whole thing

02:29:39.684 --> 02:29:41.210
where you're all basically
at a severe disadvantage

02:29:41.210 --> 02:29:42.347
fighting this thing, unless you want

02:29:42.347 --> 02:29:44.736
to be completely fucked over.

02:29:44.736 --> 02:29:45.602
All right.

02:29:45.602 --> 02:29:48.047
SAM: Should have created sunglasses
for him or something.

02:29:48.047 --> 02:29:49.870
TRAVIS: We have two of its eyes.

02:29:49.870 --> 02:29:51.083
MATT: It's now its turn.

02:29:51.083 --> 02:29:52.556
LAURA: Ugh, it's still alive.

02:29:52.556 --> 02:29:56.073
MATT: It turns and runs past,

02:29:56.073 --> 02:29:58.734
to the one who shot it
with the angry lightning bolt.

02:29:58.734 --> 02:30:00.322
(Travis laughs)

02:30:00.552 --> 02:30:03.529
MATT: The tiny gnome that now
is a delicious morsel

02:30:03.529 --> 02:30:05.178
in the mandibles of an umber hulk.

02:30:05.178 --> 02:30:08.588
It comes running forward
like a giant armored gorilla. (grunts)

02:30:09.969 --> 02:30:10.751
LAURA: Oh, no.

02:30:10.751 --> 02:30:12.928
MATT: Reaching back with both of its claws,

02:30:12.928 --> 02:30:15.809
swiping at you Scanlan,
that is a 23 to hit.

02:30:15.809 --> 02:30:16.642
SAM: Oh, yeah.

02:30:16.642 --> 02:30:17.495
MATT: 25 to hit.

02:30:17.495 --> 02:30:19.430
MATT: Its mandibles are 24 to hit.

02:30:19.430 --> 02:30:20.784
SAM: That hits three times.

02:30:20.984 --> 02:30:22.043
MATT: Yep.

02:30:22.043 --> 02:30:23.043
You take 13--

02:30:24.346 --> 02:30:25.179
LAURA: Oh, no!

02:30:26.608 --> 02:30:28.021
LIAM: But you're so little.

02:30:28.021 --> 02:30:28.854
MATT: 24.

02:30:28.854 --> 02:30:29.687
SAM: Ooh!

02:30:33.248 --> 02:30:35.506
MATT: 38 points of slashing damage.

02:30:35.506 --> 02:30:37.260
This is the sound I make.

02:30:37.260 --> 02:30:38.597
(high-pitched wail)

02:30:38.597 --> 02:30:39.849
(group laughs)

02:30:39.849 --> 02:30:42.262
MATT: As it just strikes you,
all of its form now,

02:30:42.262 --> 02:30:44.688
you're almost pinned to the ground,

02:30:44.688 --> 02:30:47.491
blood oozing from your face
as gashes, slash wounds

02:30:47.491 --> 02:30:48.990
are across your entire body.

02:30:48.990 --> 02:30:50.273
It's looming over you, ready to try

02:30:50.273 --> 02:30:52.042
and finish you off next round.

02:30:52.042 --> 02:30:52.875
LAURA: Ugh!

02:30:53.745 --> 02:30:55.637
MATT: That brings us to Vax.

02:30:55.637 --> 02:30:56.470
LIAM: Okay.

02:30:56.470 --> 02:30:58.629
So, he's now got his back turned to me.

02:30:58.629 --> 02:31:01.237
I'm just gonna stick both
knives into his guts and say,

02:31:01.237 --> 02:31:02.847
"No one touches the gnome!"

02:31:02.847 --> 02:31:05.937
LIAM: Right in his guts, that's shit.

02:31:05.937 --> 02:31:06.921
So, fuck that.

02:31:06.921 --> 02:31:09.129
And this one is way better.

02:31:09.129 --> 02:31:10.647
So that's 27.

02:31:10.647 --> 02:31:12.384
MATT: 27 hits definitely.

02:31:12.384 --> 02:31:14.403
LIAM: Okay, this is the flametongue.

02:31:14.403 --> 02:31:16.506
MATT: It is considered flanking,
because Scanlan is there.

02:31:16.506 --> 02:31:17.809
Oh yes.

02:31:17.809 --> 02:31:20.388
LIAM: Four plus two is six.

02:31:20.388 --> 02:31:23.349
(Sam sings along with dramatic music)

02:31:23.349 --> 02:31:26.349
LIAM: Two, three, fuck, four, fuck, seven,

02:31:28.639 --> 02:31:32.532
nine, 18, 24 damage.

02:31:32.532 --> 02:31:35.259
With the second knife, sneak
attack into his ball sack.

02:31:36.092 --> 02:31:38.365
MATT: How do you want to do this?

02:31:38.365 --> 02:31:39.779
(group yells triumphantly)

02:31:40.636 --> 02:31:43.312
LIAM: I stick it in the back
of his his spider nads.

02:31:43.312 --> 02:31:46.814
And rip it out his bum
and out the back of him.

02:31:46.814 --> 02:31:47.677
LAURA: Gross!

02:31:47.677 --> 02:31:49.860
LIAM: And just spill it all out the bottom.

02:31:49.863 --> 02:31:51.088
(all talking at once)

02:31:51.088 --> 02:31:53.154
SAM: I'm right next to him,
it might spill on me.

02:31:53.154 --> 02:31:54.608
LIAM: That's all right, 
that's all right.

02:31:54.608 --> 02:31:57.072
MATT: As it's looming over
Scanlan who's on his back,

02:31:57.072 --> 02:31:59.285
it's tearing into him and
starting to gut him best it can.

02:31:59.285 --> 02:32:00.707
He's screaming from beneath.

02:32:00.707 --> 02:32:03.654
You rush underneath, tumble,
bringing your dagger up

02:32:03.654 --> 02:32:05.852
and slam it right under
the bottom of its abdomen.

02:32:05.852 --> 02:32:06.685
LAURA: Balls.

02:32:06.685 --> 02:32:09.231
MATT: As you do it, (snarls),
looks down towards you

02:32:09.231 --> 02:32:11.255
and right before its gaze can meet yours,

02:32:11.258 --> 02:32:13.591
you yank back with all your might,

02:32:13.591 --> 02:32:15.770
basically scissoring and
jagged drawing the blade

02:32:15.770 --> 02:32:17.033
up the back of its body.

02:32:17.033 --> 02:32:19.128
As you do it, (imitates vomiting)

02:32:19.128 --> 02:32:20.393
leaps forward.

02:32:20.393 --> 02:32:22.232
It's now-soft torso and belly left open

02:32:22.232 --> 02:32:24.080
from the armor plates being shot off,

02:32:24.080 --> 02:32:26.339
spills a number of its warm innards

02:32:26.339 --> 02:32:28.519
right onto Scanlan's body and form.

02:32:28.519 --> 02:32:29.674
SAM: Ugh, no!

02:32:29.674 --> 02:32:31.103
It went in my mouth!

02:32:31.103 --> 02:32:33.130
(Travis laughs)

02:32:33.130 --> 02:32:34.667
MATT: And then it collapses on top of him..

02:32:34.667 --> 02:32:35.625
SAM: Ah!

02:32:35.625 --> 02:32:37.850
(group laughs)

02:32:37.850 --> 02:32:41.860
MATT: You take six points of crushing damage

02:32:41.860 --> 02:32:43.988
as the umber hulk collapses on top of you.

02:32:43.988 --> 02:32:47.783
TRAVIS: I run over and shove the
umber hulk off of Scanlan.

02:32:47.783 --> 02:32:49.087
MATT: Okay.

02:32:49.087 --> 02:32:50.017
SAM: Ugh! Ah!

02:32:50.892 --> 02:32:51.875
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

02:32:51.875 --> 02:32:53.896
SAM: What just happened?

02:32:53.896 --> 02:32:56.096
MARISHA: I go over to Scanlan, and I just,

02:32:56.096 --> 02:32:58.016
I just lay my hands on him,

02:32:58.016 --> 02:33:01.306
and I cast Cure Wounds in a level 2 spot.

02:33:01.306 --> 02:33:03.209
LIAM: Nobody touches my man-wife.

02:33:03.209 --> 02:33:05.181
(group laughs)

02:33:05.181 --> 02:33:07.133
SAM: What's that spell do?

02:33:07.133 --> 02:33:10.050
MARISHA: You do-- it's 2d8 plus 10 healing.

02:33:11.556 --> 02:33:12.601
SAM: You roll, right?

02:33:12.601 --> 02:33:13.434
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:33:13.434 --> 02:33:15.167
MARISHA: Do I roll or does he?

02:33:15.167 --> 02:33:16.583
MATT: For which spell is this?

02:33:16.583 --> 02:33:18.276
MARISHA: I'm doing Cure Wounds on him.
At level two.

02:33:18.276 --> 02:33:20.215
MATT: Cure Wounds, level two?
2d8 plus five.

02:33:20.215 --> 02:33:21.288
MARISHA: Do I roll?

02:33:21.288 --> 02:33:22.558
MATT: You roll.

02:33:22.558 --> 02:33:24.975
MARISHA: So you heal, 16, 20 points.

02:33:26.064 --> 02:33:27.064
SAM: Thank you.

02:33:29.468 --> 02:33:33.184
MATT: So, as you heal him,
touch him with the spell,

02:33:33.184 --> 02:33:35.829
you wipe the umber
hulk ichor off of your hand.

02:33:35.829 --> 02:33:38.756
ORION: I cast prestidigitation
and clean everybody up.

02:33:38.756 --> 02:33:41.200
LAURA: Maybe you should jump
in that water, Scanlan.

02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:43.092
TRAVIS: You should get in the water
and clean yourself off.

02:33:43.092 --> 02:33:44.914
TALIESIN: We have running water.
Use running water.

02:33:44.914 --> 02:33:46.458
SAM: I think I wanna keep it on.

02:33:46.458 --> 02:33:47.452
(group laughs)

02:33:47.452 --> 02:33:48.604
ORION: He's clean already.

02:33:48.604 --> 02:33:50.377
TRAVIS: As a badge of honor?

02:33:50.377 --> 02:33:51.874
SAM: It's a badge of honor.

02:33:51.874 --> 02:33:54.531
LIAM: Like the walking dead, 
you're gonna sneak by the rest of 'em?

02:33:54.531 --> 02:33:56.604
SAM: I think I'm gonna keep the blood on me,
if you don't mind.

02:33:57.520 --> 02:33:58.353
LAURA: Alright.

02:33:58.353 --> 02:33:59.520
MATT: That's, uh... okay.

02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:00.353
TRAVIS: Gross.

02:34:00.353 --> 02:34:02.742
SAM: Warning to others.

02:34:02.742 --> 02:34:03.575
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:34:03.575 --> 02:34:06.317
MATT: So, you still hear the rushing
of the water down below.

02:34:06.317 --> 02:34:09.865
You now stand at this
portion of the cavern,

02:34:09.865 --> 02:34:12.698
the dull glow in the distance
of some sort of light source

02:34:12.698 --> 02:34:14.107
in that direction.

02:34:14.107 --> 02:34:16.159
The rest of the caverns opens up this way.

02:34:16.159 --> 02:34:17.023
LAURA: Ugh.

02:34:17.023 --> 02:34:18.666
TRAVIS: Let's go towards the light.

02:34:18.666 --> 02:34:20.677
SAM: Can we take a short rest and heal up?

02:34:20.677 --> 02:34:21.593
TRAVIS: No, I run.

02:34:21.593 --> 02:34:23.056
LAURA: Short rest, short rest.

02:34:23.056 --> 02:34:24.084
TRAVIS: No, running.

02:34:24.084 --> 02:34:25.505
LIAM: Running?!

02:34:25.505 --> 02:34:26.338
(Sam laughs)

02:34:26.338 --> 02:34:27.171
SAM: Why don't you let some people heal?

02:34:27.171 --> 02:34:28.004
MATT: Grog goes running.

02:34:28.004 --> 02:34:28.837
Grog, who's interested.

02:34:28.837 --> 02:34:30.172
TRAVIS: I'm frenzy raging.

02:34:30.172 --> 02:34:31.005
SAM: Oh God, Grog!

02:34:31.005 --> 02:34:32.030
Grog, no!

02:34:32.030 --> 02:34:33.432
TRAVIS: It's a bright, shiny thing.
I'm going there!

02:34:33.432 --> 02:34:34.597
LAURA: He is frenzying.

02:34:34.597 --> 02:34:36.527
LIAM: I'm unscathed, so I run after Grog,

02:34:36.527 --> 02:34:38.326
just to give him backup if he needs.

02:34:38.326 --> 02:34:40.606
MARISHA: I'll follow after Vax.

02:34:40.606 --> 02:34:42.296
MATT: All right, you guys head out.

02:34:42.296 --> 02:34:43.578
Eventually, you come
around the corner to see

02:34:43.578 --> 02:34:44.411
what looks like a campfire.

02:34:44.411 --> 02:34:45.933
ORION: I follow as well.

02:34:45.933 --> 02:34:46.766
TRAVIS: Aww.

02:34:46.766 --> 02:34:49.739
MATT: It looks like a setup
with a small bundle of,

02:34:49.739 --> 02:34:51.250
what looks like bedding.

02:34:51.250 --> 02:34:52.873
There's a campfire set up.

02:34:52.873 --> 02:34:54.867
It's mostly out at this point.

02:34:54.867 --> 02:34:57.427
Like there's still a little
bit of a flame flicker

02:34:57.427 --> 02:35:00.086
to it, but it's just
embers for the most part.

02:35:00.916 --> 02:35:01.749
Does not appear--

02:35:01.749 --> 02:35:03.671
TRAVIS: I start hacking away at the bedding.

02:35:03.671 --> 02:35:05.454
Just chopping the shit out of it.

02:35:05.454 --> 02:35:06.406
SAM: Jesus!

02:35:06.406 --> 02:35:07.999
(group laughs)

02:35:09.310 --> 02:35:11.710
MATT: Grog starts hacking away 
at the bedding.

02:35:11.710 --> 02:35:13.684
(Travis grunts)

02:35:13.684 --> 02:35:15.296
LIAM: I'm just watching and shrugging.

02:35:15.296 --> 02:35:18.422
LAURA: No, look and search around
and see what's in the bedding.

02:35:18.422 --> 02:35:19.662
LIAM: I try to keep like six or
seven foot difference--

02:35:19.662 --> 02:35:20.747
MATT: (arrows whooshing)

02:35:20.747 --> 02:35:21.580
SAM: Oh, no!

02:35:21.580 --> 02:35:22.413
LIAM: Fuck!

02:35:22.413 --> 02:35:24.403
MATT: Three crossbow bolts come
flying out of nowhere--

02:35:24.403 --> 02:35:25.236
LIAM: You dick!

02:35:25.236 --> 02:35:26.509
MATT: --two hitting Grog.

02:35:26.509 --> 02:35:27.342
LIAM: You dick!

02:35:27.342 --> 02:35:28.167
(Marisha laughs)

02:35:28.167 --> 02:35:30.488
LAURA: Why weren't you stealthing?

02:35:30.488 --> 02:35:31.321
LIAM: I am now.

02:35:31.321 --> 02:35:34.213
TRAVIS: Somebody likes their bedding apparently.

02:35:34.213 --> 02:35:37.585
LIAM: I rolled a 29 of stealth as
soon as the first arrow flew.

02:35:37.585 --> 02:35:40.580
MARISHA: That was a Coleman, alright?

02:35:40.580 --> 02:35:41.799
(group laughs)

02:35:41.799 --> 02:35:43.220
That was a very expensive sleeping bag.

02:35:43.220 --> 02:35:45.197
TALIESIN: Never attack the bedding before
you know the thread count.

02:35:45.197 --> 02:35:46.704
TRAVIS: It was 3000 count Egyptian.

02:35:46.704 --> 02:35:47.438
TALIESIN: God.

02:35:47.438 --> 02:35:50.259
MATT: Grog, you take seven
points of piercing damage,

02:35:50.259 --> 02:35:52.563
which is halved to four
because you're raging.

02:35:52.563 --> 02:35:53.836
TRAVIS: Right. (grunts)

02:35:56.984 --> 02:36:01.456
MATT: As you can see 
what looks like three small--

02:36:01.792 --> 02:36:03.310
LIAM: Duergar.

02:36:03.310 --> 02:36:04.695
LAURA: No, they're dwarves.

02:36:04.695 --> 02:36:06.044
LIAM: Yeah, that's duergar.

02:36:06.044 --> 02:36:07.603
That's dark dwarves.

02:36:07.603 --> 02:36:08.507
LAURA: Oh!

02:36:08.507 --> 02:36:10.556
LIAM: I consider myself a nerd.

02:36:10.556 --> 02:36:14.473
MATT: And some strange beast
you've not seen before

02:36:14.871 --> 02:36:16.753
seems to be accompanying one of them.

02:36:16.753 --> 02:36:18.029
LAURA: Is that a brain?

02:36:18.029 --> 02:36:21.695
MATT: It looks like an oversized, swollen brain
with a set of claws.

02:36:21.695 --> 02:36:22.911
LIAM: It's hanging brain.

02:36:22.911 --> 02:36:24.085
SAM: Krang?

02:36:24.085 --> 02:36:24.918
MARISHA: Brain?

02:36:24.918 --> 02:36:28.412
MATT: It's just like a large brain
with a set of arms and legs

02:36:28.412 --> 02:36:29.190
like a panther.

02:36:29.190 --> 02:36:30.023
LAURA: What?

02:36:30.023 --> 02:36:32.176
TRAVIS: It's the brain bug from Starship Troopers.

02:36:32.176 --> 02:36:33.773
MARISHA: That can't be good.

02:36:33.773 --> 02:36:34.845
ORION: Take that out first.

02:36:34.845 --> 02:36:37.152
MATT: Going off the same intiative order.

02:36:37.152 --> 02:36:38.647
They've gone.

02:36:38.647 --> 02:36:40.618
LIAM: I rolled a 29 stealth.

02:36:40.618 --> 02:36:41.451
MATT: Yes, I know.

02:36:41.451 --> 02:36:43.607
So you haven't been seen, and
you have the first action.

02:36:43.607 --> 02:36:45.723
TRAVIS: Are they on the same level as us?

02:36:45.723 --> 02:36:47.056
MATT: They are, yes.

02:36:47.056 --> 02:36:49.107
LIAM: So I can dash and still attack?

02:36:49.107 --> 02:36:50.289
MATT: If you'd like to.

02:36:50.289 --> 02:36:51.652
LIAM: I would love to.

02:36:51.652 --> 02:36:52.915
I would love to, uh--

02:36:52.915 --> 02:36:53.748
where's this thing?

02:36:53.748 --> 02:36:54.781
LAURA: Go for the brain.

02:36:54.781 --> 02:36:56.254
LIAM: Yeah, of course
go for the brain.

02:36:56.254 --> 02:36:57.080
I'm gonna hang brain.

02:36:57.080 --> 02:36:57.913
I'm gonna run over--

02:36:57.913 --> 02:36:59.593
MATT: Well if you dash as your action--

02:36:59.593 --> 02:37:00.608
LIAM: Oh, I can't stealth?

02:37:00.608 --> 02:37:02.829
So to stay stealth, I
need to go normal speed?

02:37:02.829 --> 02:37:04.471
MATT: Well you can dash as your action,

02:37:04.471 --> 02:37:06.697
but dash is your, basically a double move.

02:37:06.697 --> 02:37:09.148
So you move and use your
action to move as well.

02:37:09.148 --> 02:37:10.431
LIAM: And that's it.

02:37:10.431 --> 02:37:11.887
MATT: That's all you'll be able to do.

02:37:11.887 --> 02:37:14.746
LIAM: Um, I'm gonna-- no.
I'll you what I'm gonna do.

02:37:14.746 --> 02:37:17.386
I'm gonna go-- hey, god.

02:37:17.386 --> 02:37:19.544
I'm gonna move over here, stealthily.

02:37:19.544 --> 02:37:21.525
And go for ready.

02:37:21.525 --> 02:37:22.358
MATT: Okay.

02:37:22.358 --> 02:37:23.191
LIAM: That's what it's called, right?

02:37:23.191 --> 02:37:24.024
And wait?

02:37:24.024 --> 02:37:24.857
MATT: Just wait.

02:37:24.857 --> 02:37:27.031
LIAM: And the trigger is
when this asshole duergar

02:37:27.031 --> 02:37:29.440
moves forward, I'm gonna stick
him in the back of the neck.

02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:30.772
MATT: Okay. All right.

02:37:31.605 --> 02:37:32.541
MARISHA: Nice.

02:37:32.541 --> 02:37:33.458
MATT: Tiberius.

02:37:34.862 --> 02:37:37.112
You hear Grog go, "Ugh!"

02:37:38.779 --> 02:37:41.162
ORION: Oh, it seems like there's
trouble over there.

02:37:41.162 --> 02:37:43.779
(group laughs)

02:37:43.779 --> 02:37:45.642
What has Grog gotten himself into?

02:37:45.642 --> 02:37:46.775
MARISHA: I don't know.

02:37:46.775 --> 02:37:49.193
(Travis moans and strangles)

02:37:49.193 --> 02:37:50.736
ORION: I saunter--

02:37:50.736 --> 02:37:51.569
TRAVIS: You saunter?

02:37:51.569 --> 02:37:52.500
SAM: Saunter.

02:37:52.500 --> 02:37:53.333
ORION: Yes.

02:37:53.333 --> 02:37:55.106
MATT: You jump off your pillar.

02:37:55.106 --> 02:37:56.189
ORION: Oh.

02:37:57.764 --> 02:37:59.119
MATT: Saunter over here?

02:37:59.119 --> 02:38:00.263
ORION: Yeah, I would go around there to--

02:38:00.263 --> 02:38:02.180
That's good, I suppose.

02:38:03.108 --> 02:38:05.300
What's in between the--

02:38:05.300 --> 02:38:06.647
between him and that.

02:38:06.647 --> 02:38:07.718
Is that a boulder?

02:38:07.718 --> 02:38:10.468
MATT: It's a giant raised stalagmite.

02:38:11.915 --> 02:38:13.538
ORION: I see, how tall is that?

02:38:13.538 --> 02:38:15.292
MATT: It's about 25 feet tall.

02:38:15.292 --> 02:38:16.125
ORION: Oh crap, okay.

02:38:16.125 --> 02:38:17.448
MATT: All you see is Grog standing
with three bolts

02:38:17.448 --> 02:38:19.124
sticking out of his chest now.

02:38:19.124 --> 02:38:20.769
LAURA: Oh no!

02:38:20.769 --> 02:38:22.975
(Travis imitates wood breaking)

02:38:22.975 --> 02:38:25.558
ORION: I can't do anything too much.

02:38:25.947 --> 02:38:27.660
LIAM: Grog, I've got the hiccups.

02:38:27.660 --> 02:38:29.173
MATT: Anything else, Tiberius?

02:38:29.173 --> 02:38:30.356
Gotta keep this moving.

02:38:30.356 --> 02:38:31.189
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:38:31.189 --> 02:38:32.022
LIAM: The bolts.

02:38:32.022 --> 02:38:32.855
TRAVIS: Right.

02:38:33.587 --> 02:38:36.334
ORION: I'll just cast stoneskin on myself.

02:38:36.334 --> 02:38:38.102
Okay, Stoneskin cast on you.

02:38:38.102 --> 02:38:39.869
That brings us to Vex.

02:38:39.869 --> 02:38:43.545
LAURA: All right, I can hear them
screaming so I'm gonna run over.

02:38:43.545 --> 02:38:46.343
Call Trinket as I'm doing it.

02:38:46.343 --> 02:38:47.607
TRAVIS: Who's screaming?

02:38:47.607 --> 02:38:48.839
LAURA: You, you screamed.

02:38:48.839 --> 02:38:49.827
TRAVIS: No, I'm not screaming.

02:38:49.827 --> 02:38:52.086
MATT: Do you want to use 
your full round to move?

02:38:52.086 --> 02:38:54.308
Cause that's as far as
you can move currently.

02:38:54.308 --> 02:38:55.719
Actually you can move two more.

02:38:55.719 --> 02:38:57.126
LAURA: Can I see anything from that point?

02:38:57.126 --> 02:38:59.080
MATT: All you see is Grog over there.

02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:00.509
LIAM: They're covered
and he's around the bend,

02:39:00.509 --> 02:39:02.521
so I'd run in further.

02:39:02.521 --> 02:39:04.415
LAURA: All right, I'll run in further.

02:39:04.415 --> 02:39:06.360
Can I run in and stealth or is that it?

02:39:06.360 --> 02:39:07.819
MATT: Uh, you can attempt to.

02:39:07.819 --> 02:39:09.358
LAURA: I'm gonna try to stealth
as I'm going in.

02:39:09.358 --> 02:39:11.168
MATT: You're at disadvantage
on the stealth roll,

02:39:11.168 --> 02:39:13.089
but go for it.

02:39:13.089 --> 02:39:14.490
LAURA: Oh, a 20.

02:39:14.490 --> 02:39:15.669
Aw!

02:39:15.669 --> 02:39:16.502
17, okay.

02:39:16.502 --> 02:39:18.533
Plus my stealth, which is five.

02:39:18.533 --> 02:39:20.588
MATT: All right, so we'll say
you're pulled off

02:39:20.588 --> 02:39:21.488
to the side there.

02:39:21.488 --> 02:39:23.929
The stealth twins over there
being all stealthy-like.

02:39:23.929 --> 02:39:25.419
No one can see what's going on with them.

02:39:25.419 --> 02:39:26.555
It's like they're related.

02:39:26.555 --> 02:39:27.738
TRAVIS: What's all this stealthing?

02:39:27.738 --> 02:39:28.824
Where's all the killing?

02:39:28.824 --> 02:39:29.657
MATT: That's your turn.

02:39:29.657 --> 02:39:30.850
LAURA: I can't attack anything.

02:39:30.850 --> 02:39:31.663
MATT: Scanlan.

02:39:31.663 --> 02:39:33.226
SAM: Okay, I'm gonna move right there

02:39:33.226 --> 02:39:34.679
into the room as far as I can.

02:39:34.679 --> 02:39:35.957
MATT: You can go that far.

02:39:35.957 --> 02:39:37.747
SAM: Okay.

02:39:37.747 --> 02:39:41.240
And cast Stinking Cloud right there.

02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:43.237
(Travis laughs)

02:39:43.237 --> 02:39:45.810
It's gonna smell like just ass over there.

02:39:45.810 --> 02:39:48.221
(group laughs)

02:39:48.221 --> 02:39:49.054
MATT: Okay.

02:39:49.054 --> 02:39:51.449
Best you can see, and
you haven't really seen

02:39:51.449 --> 02:39:53.731
where they are, so
you're kind of like, oh,

02:39:53.731 --> 02:39:56.548
you have the idea that perhaps
they're over in that vicinity

02:39:56.548 --> 02:39:58.144
on the bolts around there.

02:39:58.144 --> 02:40:00.283
So you can cast over in this
area, which is the only thing

02:40:00.283 --> 02:40:01.116
you have view of.

02:40:01.116 --> 02:40:02.714
SAM: Oh, oh, because that's
a big rock in my view there.

02:40:02.714 --> 02:40:03.547
MATT: This is a big rock right there, yeah.

02:40:03.547 --> 02:40:04.380
SAM: Okay, so yeah.

02:40:04.380 --> 02:40:06.839
I'll put it right where you're
saying, right there, yeah.

02:40:06.839 --> 02:40:07.745
MATT: Okay, that's about where you can go.

02:40:07.745 --> 02:40:09.723
All right, so (hisses),

02:40:09.723 --> 02:40:10.796
a giant--

02:40:10.796 --> 02:40:11.629
TRAVIS: Ass cloud.

02:40:11.629 --> 02:40:13.679
MATT: --green, ass cloud--

02:40:13.679 --> 02:40:17.076
ORION: Scanlan, are you
doing an ass cloud again?

02:40:17.076 --> 02:40:20.249
MATT: --begins to fill this space here.

02:40:20.249 --> 02:40:23.566
As it does, they all
begin to hack and cough.

02:40:23.566 --> 02:40:25.983
You can hear this now
between the rest of you,

02:40:25.983 --> 02:40:27.174
echoing throughout.

02:40:27.174 --> 02:40:28.655
TRAVIS: I'm slightly aroused.

02:40:28.655 --> 02:40:29.488
(group laughs)

02:40:29.488 --> 02:40:30.808
ORION: I was just going to say.

02:40:31.734 --> 02:40:33.629
TRAVIS: I'm drawn to the smell.

02:40:33.629 --> 02:40:35.477
SAM: (imitates flute) --stinks.

02:40:35.477 --> 02:40:38.562
MATT: ♫ Constitution saving throws.
Everything in the cloud. ♫

02:40:38.562 --> 02:40:40.638
SAM: (imitates flute) --stink.

02:40:40.638 --> 02:40:42.900
MATT: ♫ All them are failing. ♫

02:40:42.900 --> 02:40:44.383
ORION: Doing stink magic.

02:40:45.216 --> 02:40:49.875
MATT: All right. You hear a cacophonous
amount of hacking, coughing,

02:40:49.875 --> 02:40:52.644
as all of them drop their attack stances

02:40:52.644 --> 02:40:54.953
and begin just retching, nearly vomiting,

02:40:54.953 --> 02:40:57.720
in the middle of this green cloud of gas.

02:40:57.720 --> 02:40:58.887
TRAVIS: Outstanding.

02:41:00.111 --> 02:41:02.426
SAM: I'll also take a great heal potion?

02:41:02.426 --> 02:41:03.259
Is that what they're called?

02:41:03.259 --> 02:41:04.092
Not moderate.

02:41:04.092 --> 02:41:04.925
MATT: Yes, greater.

02:41:04.925 --> 02:41:05.758
SAM: Great, greater, okay.

02:41:05.758 --> 02:41:06.591
I'll do that by myself.

02:41:06.591 --> 02:41:07.551
You keep going.

02:41:07.551 --> 02:41:11.248
MATT: Okay, greater heal
potion is 4d4 plus four.

02:41:11.248 --> 02:41:12.941
SAM: Thank you.

02:41:12.941 --> 02:41:16.107
MATT: All right, that brings us to Percy.

02:41:16.107 --> 02:41:18.045
TALIESIN: I'm going to start
crawling around the--

02:41:18.045 --> 02:41:18.942
I have a little thingy.

02:41:18.942 --> 02:41:20.113
Someone took the thingy.

02:41:20.113 --> 02:41:21.151
Oh, laser pointer.

02:41:21.151 --> 02:41:22.243
Thank you.

02:41:22.243 --> 02:41:23.538
LIAM: Hello, hey.

02:41:23.538 --> 02:41:24.789
TRAVIS: It's a black light.

02:41:24.789 --> 02:41:29.046
TALIESIN: I'm gonna start heading
down this direction,

02:41:29.046 --> 02:41:31.256
and I'm going to actually
spend a movement,

02:41:31.256 --> 02:41:33.612
spend my action and move
a little further down,

02:41:33.612 --> 02:41:35.315
about, yeah, about there,

02:41:35.315 --> 02:41:37.715
so I can start getting
a good look of what's up.

02:41:37.715 --> 02:41:39.005
MATT: Okay, good.

02:41:39.005 --> 02:41:40.876
All right. That brings us to Keyleth.

02:41:40.876 --> 02:41:44.170
MARISHA: Okay, so I am going to take this

02:41:44.763 --> 02:41:47.680
and move up to about here, I guess.

02:41:50.666 --> 02:41:51.499
MATT: Okay.

02:41:51.499 --> 02:41:52.854
MARISHA: Is where I can see.

02:41:52.854 --> 02:41:55.333
And then I'm gonna
take this little block

02:41:55.333 --> 02:41:58.175
of stone right here, this stalagtite

02:41:58.175 --> 02:41:59.854
or mite or whatever it is--

02:41:59.854 --> 02:42:00.687
MATT: Correct.

02:42:00.687 --> 02:42:03.312
MARISHA: --and I'm gonna use Wall of Stone.

02:42:03.312 --> 02:42:06.113
And instead of creating a wall,
I'm just gonna take that one

02:42:06.113 --> 02:42:08.170
and I'm gonna push it (imitates thudding)

02:42:08.170 --> 02:42:10.186
against that wall and
try and crush those guys.

02:42:10.186 --> 02:42:11.019
TRAVIS: Whoa!

02:42:11.019 --> 02:42:11.852
MATT: Wait, you're gonna use
Wall of Stone to try

02:42:11.852 --> 02:42:12.778
and push that back?

02:42:12.778 --> 02:42:13.827
MARISHA: I'm gonna take this wall,

02:42:13.827 --> 02:42:15.934
and I'm gonna go crunch.

02:42:15.934 --> 02:42:16.895
MATT: All right.

02:42:16.895 --> 02:42:17.786
SAM: Oh my God.

02:42:17.786 --> 02:42:18.619
TRAVIS: Can you do that?

02:42:18.619 --> 02:42:19.452
TALIESIN: That's kinda harsh.

02:42:19.452 --> 02:42:20.285
MARISHA: I don't know.

02:42:20.285 --> 02:42:21.118
We'll find out.

02:42:21.118 --> 02:42:22.064
LAURA: I like that that's the most 
common quip.

02:42:22.064 --> 02:42:23.097
"Can, can you do that?"

02:42:23.097 --> 02:42:24.592
SAM: You can actually do that?

02:42:24.592 --> 02:42:25.675
ORION: It's like earthbending.

02:42:25.676 --> 02:42:27.169
MARISHA: I'm trying to earthbend this wall.

02:42:27.169 --> 02:42:29.262
SAM: Hey Grog. Did you ever write down
our underwater spell,

02:42:29.262 --> 02:42:31.806
potion thingies, whatever
those were called?

02:42:31.806 --> 02:42:32.639
TRAVIS: We got two of 'em.

02:42:32.639 --> 02:42:33.621
SAM: Yeah, did you right it down, though?

02:42:33.621 --> 02:42:34.454
'Cause I didn't.

02:42:34.454 --> 02:42:35.287
TRAVIS: What they were?

02:42:35.287 --> 02:42:36.902
TALIESIN: She's got waterbreathing, so.

02:42:36.902 --> 02:42:38.590
MATT: So how it works is, Wall of Stone,

02:42:38.590 --> 02:42:40.257
you can create a wall
of stone, but it cannot

02:42:40.257 --> 02:42:43.041
occupy the space of a creature.

02:42:43.041 --> 02:42:45.034
So you will not be able to
push them back, unfortunately.

02:42:45.034 --> 02:42:46.912
But you could lock them into an area,

02:42:46.912 --> 02:42:48.714
if that's what you wanted to do.

02:42:48.714 --> 02:42:50.830
SAM: The man telling us what
we can and can't do.

02:42:50.830 --> 02:42:53.288
(group laughs)

02:42:53.288 --> 02:42:55.512
MATT: It's the nature of the spell, guys.

02:42:55.512 --> 02:42:57.528
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a waste of time.

02:42:57.528 --> 02:42:58.861
Instead, I will--

02:43:01.986 --> 02:43:03.897
I still got a Call Lightning going.

02:43:03.897 --> 02:43:04.730
Fuck it.

02:43:04.730 --> 02:43:06.749
I'm just gonna lightning
bolt some bitches.

02:43:06.749 --> 02:43:07.582
MATT: All right.

02:43:07.582 --> 02:43:10.069
You don't have view of any of
them right now, unfortunately.

02:43:10.069 --> 02:43:12.738
MARISHA: Well, then I move to where I can.

02:43:12.738 --> 02:43:13.571
MATT: Okay.

02:43:13.571 --> 02:43:14.404
SAM: Yeah good.

02:43:14.404 --> 02:43:15.723
Cop attitude with the DM.

02:43:15.723 --> 02:43:16.556
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

02:43:16.556 --> 02:43:18.074
SAM: The man in charge of our fates.

02:43:18.074 --> 02:43:19.876
TALIESIN: That always goes really well.

02:43:19.876 --> 02:43:21.215
MATT: That'll be your turn.

02:43:21.215 --> 02:43:22.490
SAM: Because of the attitude.

02:43:22.490 --> 02:43:23.323
MATT: You moved twice.
You had to get a long distance.

02:43:23.323 --> 02:43:24.156
MARISHA: Did I?

02:43:24.156 --> 02:43:24.989
MATT: Yeah, because you were back here.

02:43:24.989 --> 02:43:26.672
LAURA: Yeah, dude.
It was really far away, yo.

02:43:26.672 --> 02:43:28.328
I've got a decent speed, okay, fine.
That's my turn then.

02:43:28.328 --> 02:43:29.154
MATT: Sorry.

02:43:29.154 --> 02:43:30.859
LIAM: Fuck those Wizards of the Coast, man!

02:43:30.859 --> 02:43:32.035
I do what I wanna do.

02:43:32.035 --> 02:43:33.234
MARISHA: Fucking Seattle assholes.

02:43:33.234 --> 02:43:35.208
MATT: All right, so.

02:43:35.208 --> 02:43:37.004
ORION: I love Seattle.

02:43:37.004 --> 02:43:37.837
LIAM: So do I.

02:43:38.857 --> 02:43:42.028
MATT: And what's the DC again of your spell?

02:43:42.028 --> 02:43:43.005
SAM: Ah, oh.

02:43:43.005 --> 02:43:44.962
SAM: Spell save DC, is that right? 19.

02:43:46.628 --> 02:43:48.040
MATT: 19. All right.

02:43:49.948 --> 02:43:52.896
All three of the-- and you
can now get a view of them.

02:43:52.896 --> 02:43:55.839
They are dwarven, but their
skin is ashy and grey.

02:43:55.839 --> 02:43:58.839
Their eyes are white and pupil-less.

02:43:59.976 --> 02:44:02.546
And they are all on the
verge of vomiting right now.

02:44:02.546 --> 02:44:03.931
They're both just keeling over.

02:44:03.931 --> 02:44:05.412
One of them tries to bring a crossbow up,

02:44:05.412 --> 02:44:08.043
and (imitates vomiting) has
to put it back down again.

02:44:08.043 --> 02:44:09.650
They are unable to act this turn.

02:44:09.650 --> 02:44:11.908
The weird brain creature, however--

02:44:11.908 --> 02:44:12.880
MARISHA: That's awesome.

02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:14.780
TRAVIS: What, has no nostrils?

02:44:14.780 --> 02:44:16.522
TALIESIN: There's nowhere for him to retch from.

02:44:16.522 --> 02:44:19.410
MATT: It moves out of the cloud,
looks over at you Grog.

02:44:19.410 --> 02:44:20.654
SAM: Oh, no.

02:44:20.654 --> 02:44:22.351
MATT: And just bears down for a second.

02:44:22.351 --> 02:44:24.503
And you feel this...

02:44:24.503 --> 02:44:27.102
intrusion in your mind.

02:44:27.102 --> 02:44:28.891
TRAVIS: On my professor-torial mind.

02:44:28.891 --> 02:44:30.591
MATT: Go ahead and make an
intelligence saving throw.

02:44:30.591 --> 02:44:32.160
SAM: Oh, those aren't good for you.

02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:33.034
MARISHA: Oh, no.

02:44:33.034 --> 02:44:33.804
(Travis laughs)

02:44:33.804 --> 02:44:35.725
TALIESIN: Well this, this ends poorly.

02:44:35.725 --> 02:44:37.462
TRAVIS: Oh good, my modifier's negative 2,

02:44:37.462 --> 02:44:39.129
so yippee-kye-ay-eh.

02:44:40.404 --> 02:44:41.553
Six.

02:44:41.553 --> 02:44:42.667
MATT: Alright.

02:44:42.667 --> 02:44:43.500
ORION: Good roll.

02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:44.606
TALIESIN: Good roll.

02:44:44.606 --> 02:44:46.189
MARISHA: That's a good number.

02:44:46.189 --> 02:44:48.582
MATT: You suffer nine points 
of psychic damage

02:44:48.582 --> 02:44:50.894
as there's a sudden blast
of excruciating pain

02:44:50.894 --> 02:44:52.666
in the center of your brain.

02:44:52.666 --> 02:44:54.573
It actually shakes you
a moment from your rage,

02:44:54.573 --> 02:44:57.448
which then fills your mind once again.

02:44:57.448 --> 02:44:59.828
TRAVIS: Like Kenny G music
coming through my brain.

02:44:59.828 --> 02:45:01.425
TALIESIN: Someone needs a
Juggernaut helmet.

02:45:01.425 --> 02:45:02.357
MATT: Also, you suffer--

02:45:02.357 --> 02:45:04.023
MARISHA: He needs a Magneto helmet.

02:45:04.023 --> 02:45:05.664
TALIESIN: Yeah, he needs the full Magneto.

02:45:05.664 --> 02:45:08.185
MATT: --8 points of intelligence
damage technically.

02:45:08.185 --> 02:45:09.832
You immediately fall unconscious.

02:45:09.832 --> 02:45:10.894
(Laura gasps)

02:45:10.894 --> 02:45:11.727
MARISHA: What?!

02:45:11.727 --> 02:45:12.934
MATT: Your intelligence is brought to zero.

02:45:12.934 --> 02:45:13.767
TRAVIS: Ah!

02:45:13.767 --> 02:45:15.508
But I was at six!

02:45:15.508 --> 02:45:17.034
LIAM: You gotta kill that thing.

02:45:17.034 --> 02:45:17.867
LAURA: Oh no!

02:45:17.867 --> 02:45:19.331
TRAVIS: I turn into a turnip?

02:45:20.922 --> 02:45:22.258
MATT: That brings us to--

02:45:22.258 --> 02:45:24.132
(Matt laughs)

02:45:24.132 --> 02:45:24.965
Tiberius.

02:45:28.097 --> 02:45:29.805
ORION: Tiberius, I mean--

02:45:29.805 --> 02:45:31.108
MATT: Yes, you're Tiberius.

02:45:31.108 --> 02:45:32.312
ORION: I say--

02:45:32.312 --> 02:45:34.552
MATT: You just watched Grog just go (groans)

02:45:34.552 --> 02:45:36.232
and fall to the ground.

02:45:36.232 --> 02:45:37.876
Almost into the campfire.

02:45:37.876 --> 02:45:38.949
LAURA: Oh, no.

02:45:38.949 --> 02:45:42.360
TRAVIS: It's like when I tried to read
50 Shades of Grey. (groans)

02:45:44.032 --> 02:45:45.211
ORION: Okay, I'm gonna--

02:45:45.211 --> 02:45:46.696
TALIESIN: Around the bear.

02:45:46.696 --> 02:45:49.728
ORION: Okay, I'm gonna go
right up to where Grog is.

02:45:49.728 --> 02:45:50.609
MATT: All right.

02:45:50.609 --> 02:45:53.584
ORION: Right there, right in front of him.

02:45:53.584 --> 02:45:55.413
Now can I see the brain fucker?

02:45:55.413 --> 02:45:56.669
MATT: Yes, you can from there.

02:45:56.669 --> 02:45:58.573
MARISHA: The brain fucker.

02:45:58.573 --> 02:46:00.843
MATT: The brain fucker's official name.

02:46:00.843 --> 02:46:01.924
TALIESIN: Brain lover, brain lover.

02:46:01.924 --> 02:46:03.089
ORION: Ooh, you're a nasty one.

02:46:03.089 --> 02:46:04.834
MARISHA: He's a lover, not a fighter.

02:46:04.834 --> 02:46:07.996
ORION: I'm gonna fire a glacial
blast at this dude.

02:46:07.996 --> 02:46:09.679
MATT: Okay. Single targeted beam.

02:46:09.679 --> 02:46:10.689
TALIESIN: Lobey.

02:46:10.689 --> 02:46:11.664
MARISHA: Lobey.

02:46:11.664 --> 02:46:12.990
TALIESIN: We're gonna name him Lobey.

02:46:12.990 --> 02:46:14.363
MARISHA: Let's call him Lobey.

02:46:14.373 --> 02:46:15.112
(Laura laughs)

02:46:15.112 --> 02:46:16.361
MATT: Makes its saving throw.

02:46:16.361 --> 02:46:17.194
TALIESIN: "Lobey, no!"

02:46:17.194 --> 02:46:19.224
MATT: What's your DC?

02:46:19.224 --> 02:46:20.494
ORION: My DC is 17.

02:46:20.494 --> 02:46:22.364
MATT: It just rolled a 17, yeah.
It makes the saving throw.

02:46:22.364 --> 02:46:23.395
So half damage.

02:46:23.395 --> 02:46:24.998
TALIESIN: Take him everywhere.

02:46:24.998 --> 02:46:26.301
ORION: Four, six, and 8d6.

02:46:27.491 --> 02:46:29.539
TALIESIN: Our little Lobey.

02:46:30.605 --> 02:46:32.773
MARISHA: Can we call him Jeff, Jeff Lobey?

02:46:32.773 --> 02:46:34.744
SAM: Is that campfire still firing?

02:46:34.744 --> 02:46:36.007
TALIESIN: Jeff Lobey.

02:46:36.007 --> 02:46:37.240
MATT: It's embers, yeah.

02:46:37.240 --> 02:46:38.811
21, 22, 23.

02:46:38.811 --> 02:46:39.909
24, 26, 27, 22.

02:46:39.909 --> 02:46:41.445
29 damage.

02:46:41.445 --> 02:46:42.483
MATT: 29 damage?

02:46:42.483 --> 02:46:43.546
(Taliesin laughing)

02:46:44.149 --> 02:46:46.352
MATT: As you put your arms out,

02:46:46.352 --> 02:46:49.238
you focus this blast of just
freezing cold arcane energy

02:46:49.238 --> 02:46:51.668
that slams into the side
of this brain creature.

02:46:51.668 --> 02:46:53.230
TALIESIN: Jeff Lobey, thank you.

02:46:53.230 --> 02:46:56.239
MATT: As it does, you see it begins
to freeze its entire body.

02:46:56.239 --> 02:46:58.826
As it reaches up and tries
to climb up it solidifies

02:46:58.826 --> 02:47:02.826
and then shatters into a
hundred million pieces.

02:47:04.328 --> 02:47:05.161
(group cheers)

02:47:05.161 --> 02:47:06.885
SAM: Oh, the brain's dead.

02:47:06.885 --> 02:47:08.511
TALIESIN: You killed Jeff Lobey!

02:47:08.511 --> 02:47:10.130
MARISHA: You killed Jeff Lobey.

02:47:10.130 --> 02:47:11.079
SAM: Lisa Loeb?

02:47:11.079 --> 02:47:12.310
MARISHA: Lisa Lobey!

02:47:12.310 --> 02:47:14.017
(group laughs)

02:47:14.017 --> 02:47:15.047
They just keep going!

02:47:15.047 --> 02:47:18.599
MATT: Lisa Loeb and then the
nine intelligence damage.

02:47:19.449 --> 02:47:20.282
All right.

02:47:20.282 --> 02:47:22.400
So the brain just (imitates
shattering) cascades

02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:23.481
across the ground.

02:47:23.481 --> 02:47:24.545
LIAM: Lisa Lobey.

02:47:24.545 --> 02:47:25.878
MATT: And thank God.

02:47:25.878 --> 02:47:27.913
Vex, you're now seeing three dwarves

02:47:27.913 --> 02:47:29.337
retching and coughing over,

02:47:29.337 --> 02:47:32.481
kind of looking about very nervously.

02:47:32.481 --> 02:47:36.158
LAURA: Can I move to where I can get
a line of site on that one?

02:47:36.158 --> 02:47:37.279
MATT: On this one here?

02:47:37.279 --> 02:47:38.112
LAURA: Yeah.

02:47:38.112 --> 02:47:39.388
MATT: Yeah, you can move to there
and get a line of sight.

02:47:39.388 --> 02:47:41.866
LAURA: Okay cool, then
I'm gonna shoot him.

02:47:41.866 --> 02:47:43.616
Oh wait, no, I can't.

02:47:44.894 --> 02:47:45.727
SAM: Why?

02:47:45.727 --> 02:47:46.923
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah, I'm gonna do that.

02:47:46.923 --> 02:47:47.898
LIAM: You still have a little bit of cover.

02:47:47.898 --> 02:47:49.969
LAURA: I'm gonna do-- it's fine, I got it.

02:47:49.969 --> 02:47:50.935
I'm really good.

02:47:50.935 --> 02:47:53.188
LIAM: Just be a badass, okay?
That's your job.

02:47:53.188 --> 02:47:54.078
LAURA: Okay.

02:47:55.943 --> 02:47:56.776
27.

02:47:58.047 --> 02:47:59.628
MATT: That hits.

02:47:59.628 --> 02:48:00.592
LIAM: Are you alright, big guy?

02:48:02.058 --> 02:48:03.445
LIAM: "Muh!"

02:48:03.445 --> 02:48:05.761
LAURA: Oh, I should've tried to-- it's okay.

02:48:05.761 --> 02:48:07.554
LIAM: "Muh! Muh!"

02:48:07.554 --> 02:48:10.179
SAM: It's weird, Grog weirdly seems 
smarter now than he was before.

02:48:10.179 --> 02:48:11.381
LAURA: Hunter's Mark on that guy.

02:48:11.381 --> 02:48:12.409
MATT: Okay.

02:48:12.409 --> 02:48:13.242
SAM: Beep boop.

02:48:13.242 --> 02:48:14.378
MATT: Good remembering.

02:48:14.378 --> 02:48:16.321
MARISHA: Professor Grog's 
having a hard time.

02:48:16.321 --> 02:48:17.074
LAURA: 11.

02:48:17.074 --> 02:48:17.907
MATT: 11, all right.

02:48:17.907 --> 02:48:20.220
LAURA: 11, and then I'm gonna 
hit him again.

02:48:20.220 --> 02:48:21.553
And that's a 23.

02:48:22.468 --> 02:48:23.301
MATT: All right.

02:48:23.301 --> 02:48:26.141
LAURA: And that is nine damage for that arrow.

02:48:26.141 --> 02:48:29.150
And then the six for a
Hunter's Mark is five.

02:48:29.150 --> 02:48:30.524
MATT: So a total of...?

02:48:30.524 --> 02:48:33.274
LAURA: Oh jeez-louise, 30 plus five is...

02:48:35.907 --> 02:48:37.335
35.

02:48:37.335 --> 02:48:38.702
MATT: (imitates arrows flying) "Ugh!"

02:48:38.702 --> 02:48:41.946
The hacking, coughing duergar
dwarf is like, (coughs)

02:48:41.946 --> 02:48:44.344
One in the shoulder,
and the other shoulder.

02:48:44.344 --> 02:48:46.554
And it looks like that
you, (inhales sharply)

02:48:46.554 --> 02:48:49.454
As it inhales a big old whiff
of horrible stinking cloud gas,

02:48:49.454 --> 02:48:52.104
the arrow (imitates arrow flying) 
through its throat

02:48:52.104 --> 02:48:53.552
and out the back of its head.

02:48:53.552 --> 02:48:54.850
Falls flat on its back.

02:48:54.850 --> 02:48:55.683
LAURA: Yeah.

02:48:55.683 --> 02:48:57.310
(group cheers)

02:48:57.310 --> 02:48:59.513
MATT: The other ones look nervously about.

02:48:59.513 --> 02:49:01.437
MARISHA: Get him a pillow! What!

02:49:01.437 --> 02:49:04.977
MATT: One of them's just coughing out,
saying something in Undercommon.

02:49:04.984 --> 02:49:06.708
(speaks in angry gibberish)

02:49:06.708 --> 02:49:08.261
MATT: Anyone here speak Undercommon?

02:49:08.261 --> 02:49:09.338
LAURA: I do!

02:49:09.338 --> 02:49:10.171
MATT: You do?

02:49:10.171 --> 02:49:11.253
SAM: You speak Undercommon?

02:49:11.253 --> 02:49:12.086
LAURA: I do.

02:49:12.086 --> 02:49:13.329
TALIESIN: Oondercommon.

02:49:13.329 --> 02:49:15.942
LAURA: I knew we were gonna be
going down into some--

02:49:15.942 --> 02:49:18.918
MATT: You hear him say, 
"Quick, there's our exit!

02:49:18.918 --> 02:49:20.770
"Back, back to the master."

02:49:20.770 --> 02:49:22.648
LAURA: (whispering) Back to the master!

02:49:22.648 --> 02:49:24.122
TRAVIS: Who's the master?

02:49:24.122 --> 02:49:25.834
LAURA: You're unconscious.

02:49:25.834 --> 02:49:26.667
MATT: All right.

02:49:26.667 --> 02:49:28.834
That brings us to Scanlan.

02:49:31.079 --> 02:49:31.996
SAM: Ah, shit.

02:49:31.996 --> 02:49:34.115
I did not understand them, right?

02:49:34.115 --> 02:49:36.274
So I don't know that they're going to run.

02:49:36.274 --> 02:49:36.984
MATT: No.

02:49:36.984 --> 02:49:40.065
TRAVIS: Let 'em run back to the
master and we'll track 'em.

02:49:40.065 --> 02:49:42.648
SAM: I didn't learn that they're running, so.

02:49:42.648 --> 02:49:45.615
Can I call out that I heard them?
Say, "Don't let them run!"

02:49:45.615 --> 02:49:48.374
MATT: No, this happening 
just as you heard them.

02:49:48.744 --> 02:49:49.827
SAM: Okay, well.

02:49:51.652 --> 02:49:53.708
I don't have a good line of sight on them,

02:49:53.708 --> 02:49:57.139
so I don't even know that
they're there really, right?

02:49:57.139 --> 02:49:59.059
I just hear coughing in the distance.

02:49:59.059 --> 02:50:00.535
MATT: Yep.

02:50:00.535 --> 02:50:04.360
Then I'll just move further
into the cavern there.

02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:06.766
And I don't know that this works,

02:50:06.766 --> 02:50:09.973
but I'll try to cast Dispel Magic on Grog.

02:50:09.973 --> 02:50:10.756
MATT: Okay.

02:50:10.756 --> 02:50:12.738
SAM: I don't know if that, if it's magic.

02:50:12.738 --> 02:50:13.658
I have no idea.

02:50:13.658 --> 02:50:16.176
MATT: So you go ahead and you
focus, you cast Dispel Magic

02:50:16.176 --> 02:50:17.037
in Grog's vicinity.

02:50:17.037 --> 02:50:17.865
SAM: ♫ Wake up, Grog ♫

02:50:17.865 --> 02:50:20.204
MATT: You see the shift of arcane,
waving energy.

02:50:20.204 --> 02:50:21.317
TRAVIS: ♫ If I only had a brain ♫

02:50:21.317 --> 02:50:22.157
MATT: It does not seem to have an effect.

02:50:22.157 --> 02:50:23.293
SAM: It doesn't do it!

02:50:23.293 --> 02:50:24.395
Damn it!

02:50:24.395 --> 02:50:27.772
Then as my bonus action, 
can I still give him an inspiration dice

02:50:27.772 --> 02:50:29.425
to do on like saving...?

02:50:29.425 --> 02:50:32.557
MATT: You think at this point,
Grog isn't unconscious.

02:50:32.557 --> 02:50:34.167
Grog is catatonic.

02:50:34.167 --> 02:50:35.910
Grog has no intelligence.

02:50:35.910 --> 02:50:37.405
There is nothing home.

02:50:37.405 --> 02:50:40.171
You see him, on the ground,
drooling, eyes glazed over.

02:50:40.171 --> 02:50:41.107
There is nothing there.

02:50:41.107 --> 02:50:43.214
TALIESIN: You can't inspire a cantaloupe.

02:50:43.214 --> 02:50:44.581
LAURA: What are we gonna do?

02:50:44.581 --> 02:50:47.238
TALIESIN: The cantaloupe,
it's not gonna feel better about itself.

02:50:47.238 --> 02:50:49.567
SAM: Okay, then I give my dice to Vax.

02:50:49.567 --> 02:50:52.745
TALIESIN: I've tried insulting a cantaloupe,
you just don't get anywhere.

02:50:52.745 --> 02:50:56.246
SAM: Vax, I've just inspired you.
(imitates flute)

02:50:56.246 --> 02:50:59.392
MATT: I think the chat room's catching on
for those who know D&amp;amp;D well.

02:50:59.392 --> 02:51:02.048
LIAM: Okay, I hear a little
shithead grey-skinned dwarf--

02:51:02.048 --> 02:51:02.881
SAM: Wait, it's not your turn.

02:51:02.881 --> 02:51:03.714
I just gave you dice.

02:51:03.714 --> 02:51:05.177
I thought you said Vax.
Okay, sorry.

02:51:05.177 --> 02:51:06.213
MATT: It's all right.

02:51:06.213 --> 02:51:07.346
So that ends Scanlan's turn.

02:51:07.346 --> 02:51:08.195
Percy.

02:51:08.195 --> 02:51:09.459
LIAM: Damn it.

02:51:09.459 --> 02:51:11.012
TALIESIN: Laser.

02:51:11.012 --> 02:51:12.595
I'm going to take my laser.

02:51:12.595 --> 02:51:14.096
MATT: Your laser? Point your laser?

02:51:14.096 --> 02:51:15.179
(Liam imitates ray gun)

02:51:15.179 --> 02:51:19.361
TALIESIN: All right, I want to crawl forward
to the other side of Grog over there,

02:51:19.361 --> 02:51:21.567
so I can see this little jerk.

02:51:21.567 --> 02:51:23.626
MATT: It's a tough call, he has cover.

02:51:23.626 --> 02:51:24.859
You can still see him.

02:51:24.859 --> 02:51:26.112
TALIESIN: I ignore cover.

02:51:26.112 --> 02:51:28.244
It's one of my magical things that I do.

02:51:28.244 --> 02:51:30.577
LIAM: Three-quarters cover
according to the new rules.

02:51:30.577 --> 02:51:31.903
MARISHA: Yeah, he's got a gun.

02:51:31.903 --> 02:51:34.605
TALIESIN: Yeah, I ignore half 
or three-quarters cover.

02:51:34.605 --> 02:51:37.366
MATT: Then you can ignore three-quarters cover,
which he has. So, yes.

02:51:37.376 --> 02:51:38.972
TALIESIN: Okay, I ignore it.

02:51:38.972 --> 02:51:42.324
I'm also going to take a penalty
to my attack bonus

02:51:42.324 --> 02:51:46.831
to attempt to do some damage
and to not kill, but injure, if possible.

02:51:47.994 --> 02:51:48.827
MATT: Okay.

02:51:48.827 --> 02:51:50.696
TALIESIN: I wanna leave one for questioning.

02:51:50.696 --> 02:51:51.791
MATT: Okay.

02:51:51.791 --> 02:51:54.370
So go ahead and roll
disadvantage on this attack.

02:51:54.370 --> 02:51:56.705
Or do you want to just do subdual damage,
which is what you're doing?

02:51:56.705 --> 02:51:57.754
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:51:57.754 --> 02:51:59.789
All right, so you're gonna aim in a way
that doesn't do lethal damage.

02:51:59.789 --> 02:52:00.580
Go for it.

02:52:00.580 --> 02:52:02.543
MATT: It's a normal attack,
there's no penalty to it.

02:52:02.543 --> 02:52:05.016
TALIESIN: Just my penalty for extra damage.

02:52:05.016 --> 02:52:06.132
MATT: Mm hm.

02:52:06.132 --> 02:52:06.965
TALIESIN: Aha!

02:52:07.943 --> 02:52:08.776
I crit!

02:52:09.725 --> 02:52:10.892
So that's fun.

02:52:12.987 --> 02:52:14.487
Let's roll damage.

02:52:16.477 --> 02:52:18.292
9, 10, that's 25 points of damage.

02:52:18.292 --> 02:52:19.125
LAURA: Yeah!

02:52:19.125 --> 02:52:20.494
MATT: 25 points of damage.

02:52:20.494 --> 02:52:23.445
All right, you run around the corner,
pull the gun out,

02:52:23.445 --> 02:52:25.662
and aim at this like-- (coughs)

02:52:25.662 --> 02:52:29.349
Where you look now, you see this
ghastly looking, evil, female-looking

02:52:29.349 --> 02:52:30.947
grey-skinned dwarf.

02:52:30.947 --> 02:52:32.809
Looks over at you and (gasps)

02:52:32.809 --> 02:52:34.169
reacts and goes for her weapon.

02:52:34.169 --> 02:52:35.577
As you do, you let loose and fire straight

02:52:35.577 --> 02:52:38.217
into her shoulder, blasting
through most of her shoulder,

02:52:38.217 --> 02:52:39.560
exposing bone.

02:52:39.560 --> 02:52:41.466
It's not a deahtblow, but you see

02:52:41.466 --> 02:52:43.234
she has been incapacitated.

02:52:43.234 --> 02:52:44.067
ORION: Nice.

02:52:44.067 --> 02:52:45.429
TALIESIN: That's my turn.

02:52:45.429 --> 02:52:48.621
LAURA: I call out, "Let one of them live, 
so I can question them."

02:52:48.621 --> 02:52:50.246
TALIESIN: That's-- we got one.

02:52:50.246 --> 02:52:51.629
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

02:52:51.629 --> 02:52:52.654
MARISHA: We got one?

02:52:52.654 --> 02:52:53.677
TALIESIN: We got one.

02:52:54.280 --> 02:52:55.343
MARISHA: Well, then.

02:52:55.343 --> 02:52:56.656
MATT: That dwarf survived.

02:52:56.656 --> 02:52:57.673
With one hit point.

02:52:57.673 --> 02:53:00.240
MARISHA: If we got the guy we need.

02:53:00.593 --> 02:53:03.097
I will move over a bit.

02:53:03.097 --> 02:53:04.288
Yeah.

02:53:04.288 --> 02:53:05.770
And... (imitates energy firing)

02:53:05.770 --> 02:53:07.121
MATT: All right, go for it.

02:53:07.121 --> 02:53:08.357
LIAM: Vines?

02:53:08.357 --> 02:53:11.630
MATT: First off, make a constitution save,
'cause you stepped into a stinking cloud.

02:53:11.630 --> 02:53:13.297
Unless you wanna move back here.

02:53:13.297 --> 02:53:14.868
There you go.

02:53:15.330 --> 02:53:17.320
MARISHA: Not having control.

02:53:17.320 --> 02:53:18.358
MATT: Laser pointer.

02:53:18.358 --> 02:53:21.434
MARISHA: I do (mumbles).

02:53:21.434 --> 02:53:22.338
Okay.

02:53:24.113 --> 02:53:25.113
So that is...

02:53:27.320 --> 02:53:28.153
what is that?

02:53:28.153 --> 02:53:28.986
22?

02:53:28.986 --> 02:53:30.645
MATT: 22 points of damage. All right.

02:53:30.645 --> 02:53:32.690
So the bolt streaks from
the cloud in the sky,

02:53:32.690 --> 02:53:34.250
slamming into this other duergar.

02:53:34.250 --> 02:53:36.033
As it sparks into the ground,
you see bits of stone

02:53:36.033 --> 02:53:38.007
get thrown up from the
sheer force of the bolt,

02:53:38.007 --> 02:53:39.702
doing a sincere amount of damage to it.

02:53:39.702 --> 02:53:42.760
Not enough to finish it, but
it looks very, very fucked up.

02:53:42.760 --> 02:53:44.603
You can see part of its face
is charred now,

02:53:44.603 --> 02:53:46.051
and it's reeling from the blast.

02:53:46.051 --> 02:53:49.202
Probably blew out its eardrums
from the cacophonous blast of the thunder.

02:53:49.213 --> 02:53:50.513
MARISHA: That's my turn.

02:53:50.513 --> 02:53:51.674
MATT: That's your turn.

02:53:51.674 --> 02:53:54.174
It's now both of their turn.

02:53:54.176 --> 02:53:56.724
They both failed their
saves with a two and a four.

02:53:56.724 --> 02:54:00.001
They're both still hacking and coughing
in the stinking cloud.

02:54:00.001 --> 02:54:01.084
Uh, go bards.

02:54:01.084 --> 02:54:02.604
Vax, you're up.

02:54:02.604 --> 02:54:06.379
LIAM: Okay, and there's a big cloud
of poo stink around them, so--

02:54:06.379 --> 02:54:08.258
MATT: Correct, so all here.

02:54:08.258 --> 02:54:10.438
ORION: "The poo cloud," Keyleth calls it.

02:54:10.438 --> 02:54:12.121
LIAM: God dammit. All right.

02:54:12.121 --> 02:54:13.594
MARISHA: Do I? "The poo cloud."

02:54:13.594 --> 02:54:14.427
LIAM: Fuck it.

02:54:14.427 --> 02:54:15.980
SAM: Just go in there, man.

02:54:15.980 --> 02:54:18.543
LIAM: I'm gonna hold my
breath, and I'm gonna go

02:54:18.543 --> 02:54:20.876
one, two, three, four, five,

02:54:22.839 --> 02:54:24.407
and grab this guy around the neck

02:54:24.407 --> 02:54:27.195
and hold my daggers to his neck.

02:54:27.195 --> 02:54:29.765
And just hunker down and
try to hold him hostage.

02:54:29.765 --> 02:54:30.734
MATT: Okay.

02:54:30.734 --> 02:54:33.052
Go ahead and make a constitution check.

02:54:33.052 --> 02:54:34.755
TRAVIS: A dirty mafia check?

02:54:34.755 --> 02:54:36.271
LIAM: Is that a, is that a--

02:54:36.271 --> 02:54:39.367
MATT: With advantage, because
you're holding your breath.

02:54:39.367 --> 02:54:40.465
LIAM: Okay.

02:54:40.465 --> 02:54:41.298
14.

02:54:41.298 --> 02:54:42.641
TRAVIS: Just breathe it in.

02:54:42.641 --> 02:54:44.140
SAM: Use the dice! Use the dice!

02:54:44.140 --> 02:54:45.233
LIAM: What did you give me?

02:54:45.233 --> 02:54:46.249
SAM: A d8.

02:54:46.249 --> 02:54:47.141
LIAM: 22.

02:54:47.141 --> 02:54:49.451
SAM: No, it's not an eight. A d8.
You gotta roll it.

02:54:49.451 --> 02:54:51.102
MATT: Roll a d8 to add to it.

02:54:52.112 --> 02:54:52.945
LIAM: 15.

02:54:52.945 --> 02:54:54.005
(group laughs)

02:54:54.005 --> 02:54:55.898
LIAM: It came up a one.

02:54:55.898 --> 02:54:56.731
TRAVIS: 22!

02:54:56.731 --> 02:54:59.592
MATT: So, as you rush in the cloud,
(breathes deeply)

02:54:59.592 --> 02:55:01.718
you run in, pull your daggers out,

02:55:01.718 --> 02:55:04.968
and because this isn't a natural cloud,
the arcane force puts it in your nostrils

02:55:04.968 --> 02:55:06.813
and you can't help yourself. (coughs)

02:55:06.813 --> 02:55:09.935
Your turn immediately ends 
as you begin feeling your lunch

02:55:09.935 --> 02:55:11.612
retching up into your stomach.

02:55:11.612 --> 02:55:12.935
TRAVIS: Puke on him.

02:55:12.935 --> 02:55:14.762
MATT: Okay. That brings us to Grog.

02:55:14.762 --> 02:55:15.595
You are a--

02:55:15.595 --> 02:55:16.838
TRAVIS: Oh, I got it.

02:55:16.838 --> 02:55:18.220
(blows raspberry)

02:55:18.220 --> 02:55:19.296
MATT: You are brain-dead.

02:55:19.296 --> 02:55:20.150
(group laughs)

02:55:20.150 --> 02:55:21.162
Tiberius, you're up.

02:55:21.162 --> 02:55:22.684
LAURA: So sorry, Grog.

02:55:22.684 --> 02:55:25.186
SAM: Can we heal him, what is it?
What do we need to do?

02:55:25.186 --> 02:55:26.969
MARISHA: We'll figure that out when
we kill this guy, I guess.

02:55:26.969 --> 02:55:27.802
LAURA: Restoration?

02:55:27.802 --> 02:55:29.359
LIAM: Can you dispel that shit?

02:55:29.359 --> 02:55:30.617
SAM: I tried, I tried.

02:55:30.617 --> 02:55:32.261
MARISHA: He can't dispel it,
It's not magic.

02:55:32.261 --> 02:55:34.119
But I might be able to 
cure him afterwards.

02:55:34.119 --> 02:55:35.881
LIAM: Tiberius, can you dispel that shit?

02:55:35.881 --> 02:55:36.714
ORION: It's the same spell.

02:55:36.714 --> 02:55:39.498
LAURA: It's a restoration spell, 
it's not a dispel.

02:55:41.134 --> 02:55:42.786
MARISHA: I might be able to.

02:55:42.786 --> 02:55:46.682
ORION: So, the guy knocked down 
over there is--

02:55:46.682 --> 02:55:49.218
let me see that pointer.

02:55:49.218 --> 02:55:52.876
This guy, that's the one that
we knocked out with the arrow?

02:55:52.876 --> 02:55:55.104
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's the dead one.

02:55:55.104 --> 02:55:56.460
ORION: The dead one 
or the one we knocked out?

02:55:56.460 --> 02:55:57.885
TALIESIN: He's dead.

02:55:57.885 --> 02:55:58.718
ORION: Who do we have incapacitated?

02:55:58.718 --> 02:55:59.551
TALIESIN: That's the one we shot.

02:55:59.551 --> 02:56:00.886
MARISHA: That's the one Liam has.

02:56:00.886 --> 02:56:02.308
LAURA: Let one live.

02:56:02.308 --> 02:56:03.338
ORION: And the one right here is...?

02:56:03.338 --> 02:56:05.073
LIAM: The one by me is weak.

02:56:05.073 --> 02:56:07.863
MATT: Both of them are pretty
weak right now, actually.

02:56:07.863 --> 02:56:11.236
ORION: I think I can step next to Percy
without stepping into that cloud.

02:56:11.236 --> 02:56:12.584
MATT: So you can step over Grog,
get around here, you mean?

02:56:12.584 --> 02:56:13.777
LAURA: (laughs) Honk.

02:56:13.777 --> 02:56:15.046
TRAVIS: That's-- come on.

02:56:15.529 --> 02:56:18.426
ORION: Sorry, excuse me, Grog, pardon.

02:56:18.426 --> 02:56:22.000
I will shoot a firebolt 
at the butthole across the way.

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:25.153
MATT: There? All right.
Go ahead and roll for the attack.

02:56:27.745 --> 02:56:28.578
ORION: 14.

02:56:28.578 --> 02:56:29.534
MATT: 14.

02:56:29.534 --> 02:56:31.243
Unfortunately does not hit.

02:56:31.243 --> 02:56:33.764
You aim, and it manages to
just pull out of the way.

02:56:33.764 --> 02:56:35.075
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

02:56:35.075 --> 02:56:36.390
MATT: Vex. You're up.

02:56:36.390 --> 02:56:37.223
LAURA: Me?

02:56:37.223 --> 02:56:38.056
MATT: Yes.

02:56:38.056 --> 02:56:40.917
LAURA: I step over, and I try to shoot
the one that he just--

02:56:41.763 --> 02:56:43.183
I stay out of the stink.

02:56:43.183 --> 02:56:44.625
MATT: There you go, yeah.

02:56:44.625 --> 02:56:46.491
Pull back-- (imitates bow shooting arrow)

02:56:46.491 --> 02:56:47.324
LAURA: All right.

02:56:47.324 --> 02:56:48.741
MATT: Roll to attack.

02:56:50.582 --> 02:56:51.729
LAURA: 23.

02:56:51.729 --> 02:56:54.896
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

02:56:55.837 --> 02:56:56.670
LAURA: 8.

02:56:56.670 --> 02:56:57.644
MATT: That's enough.

02:56:57.644 --> 02:57:00.187
As the arrow (imitates arrow flying),
careens off, slams into the chest.

02:57:00.191 --> 02:57:02.564
(groans) It catches itself, steps back,

02:57:02.564 --> 02:57:04.639
and plummets off the side of the cliff

02:57:04.639 --> 02:57:06.902
onto the lower floor about 20 feet down.

02:57:06.902 --> 02:57:08.104
Smack, onto the ground.

02:57:08.504 --> 02:57:09.979
LAURA: And I ask Scanlan
to dispel the stank cloud.

02:57:09.979 --> 02:57:12.979
TALIESIN: Dispel the stank.

02:57:12.979 --> 02:57:16.342
LAURA: And I yell--
Can I yell out "surrender" in Undercommon?

02:57:17.289 --> 02:57:19.410
MATT: You yell out, (speaks angry gibberish)!

02:57:19.410 --> 02:57:20.933
(Laura speaks angry gibberish)

02:57:20.933 --> 02:57:22.333
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

02:57:22.333 --> 02:57:24.676
TRAVIS: That was a very good Klingon translation.

02:57:24.676 --> 02:57:25.509
LAURA: Klingon.

02:57:25.509 --> 02:57:27.723
(Liam speaks angry gibberish)

02:57:28.096 --> 02:57:29.290
Whoa! Okay.

02:57:30.480 --> 02:57:31.379
Um, eight.

02:57:31.379 --> 02:57:32.212
MATT: Eight?

02:57:32.212 --> 02:57:33.209
LAURA: Eight.

02:57:33.209 --> 02:57:35.082
LIAM: What is with the dice tonight?

02:57:35.082 --> 02:57:36.174
MATT: It rolled a one.

02:57:36.174 --> 02:57:37.391
(group cheers)

02:57:37.391 --> 02:57:42.306
MATT: It looks around and its
circumstances being extremely dire.

02:57:42.306 --> 02:57:45.094
It drops its weapons, falls to its knees.

02:57:45.094 --> 02:57:46.642
At your mercy.

02:57:46.642 --> 02:57:47.853
That's where we'll end the game tonight.

02:57:47.853 --> 02:57:49.520
SAM: Oh!
TALIESIN: Hey!

02:57:49.520 --> 02:57:50.379
TRAVIS: What?!

02:57:50.379 --> 02:57:51.212
MATT: Yeah.

02:57:51.212 --> 02:57:52.045
LAURA: You're, you're-- yeah.

02:57:52.045 --> 02:57:53.208
SAM: Grog is brain dead.

02:57:53.208 --> 02:57:56.041
MARISHA: I was gonna say, can I
go over and heal Grog before we end?

02:57:56.041 --> 02:57:57.703
TRAVIS: I'm Vanilla Sky right now.

02:57:57.703 --> 02:57:58.536
MATT: Nope, we're picking up next week.

02:57:58.536 --> 02:57:59.506
LAURA: Oh no.

02:57:59.506 --> 02:58:02.183
LIAM: Just five more hours, Matt.
Just five more hours.

02:58:02.183 --> 02:58:04.070
MATT: We'll say for the circumstance here,

02:58:04.070 --> 02:58:06.443
you go ahead and spend
a healing spell on him.

02:58:06.443 --> 02:58:08.826
His wounds mend, no effect
on his catatonic state.

02:58:08.826 --> 02:58:09.894
(group groans)

02:58:10.184 --> 02:58:12.215
SAM: We have to wait a week.

02:58:12.215 --> 02:58:14.888
MATT: Well guys, that's episode two
of Critical Role.

02:58:14.888 --> 02:58:15.902
(laughs)

02:58:15.902 --> 02:58:16.735
MARISHA: Damn it.

02:58:16.735 --> 02:58:17.751
MATT: I hope you enjoyed it.

02:58:17.751 --> 02:58:20.132
Remember to tell your
friends to come watch.

02:58:20.132 --> 02:58:22.298
We'll be back next week, Thursday at 7:00.

02:58:22.298 --> 02:58:24.225
I know the schedule said seven to nine.

02:58:24.225 --> 02:58:25.766
We usually run a little later.

02:58:25.766 --> 02:58:27.071
Because D&amp;amp;D and why not?

02:58:27.071 --> 02:58:28.387
LAURA: Oh, is this seven to nine?

02:58:28.387 --> 02:58:30.130
MATT: It says seven to nine in the schedule,

02:58:30.130 --> 02:58:31.757
but we consider seven to ten.

02:58:31.757 --> 02:58:33.025
But yeah, hope you guys had fun.

02:58:33.025 --> 02:58:34.189
Thank you so much for watching.

02:58:34.189 --> 02:58:36.813
Hope we will have our
donations up next week.

02:58:36.813 --> 02:58:37.988
Feel free to check it out.

02:58:37.988 --> 02:58:40.721
This is Zac, our amazing
master of all awesomeness

02:58:40.721 --> 02:58:42.052
on this Twitch channel.

02:58:42.052 --> 02:58:43.468
Hey Zac, what's going on?

02:58:43.468 --> 02:58:44.773
ZAC: Hey, good job, guys.

02:58:44.773 --> 02:58:46.106
MATT: Thank you, thank you.

02:58:46.106 --> 02:58:47.800
ZAC: You got a thousand subscribers.

02:58:47.800 --> 02:58:48.866
(group cheers)

02:58:48.866 --> 02:58:51.421
ZAC: Crazy, that's like, two weeks in.

02:58:51.421 --> 02:58:52.254
MATT: Yeah, I know.

02:58:52.254 --> 02:58:53.904
You go, Nyal.
We'll get you your stuff.

02:58:53.904 --> 02:58:55.770
MARISHA: Yeah, you get a 
Player's Handbook. That's lucky.

02:58:55.770 --> 02:58:56.994
ZAC: We'll get you your shit!

02:58:56.994 --> 02:58:58.308
I gotta print that photo so
you guys can all sign it.

02:58:58.308 --> 02:58:59.814
MATT: Yes yes, let's go do that.

02:58:59.814 --> 02:59:02.376
ZAC: No, it'll probably be
sent to you next Friday,

02:59:02.376 --> 02:59:04.818
'cause we'll have you guys
sign it next Thursday.

02:59:04.818 --> 02:59:05.941
LAURA: Sounds good.

02:59:05.941 --> 02:59:06.774
MATT: Okay, cool.

02:59:06.774 --> 02:59:09.437
TRAVIS: Zac, do you have any renew
intelligence potions on you, by chance?

02:59:09.437 --> 02:59:10.244
ZAC: For you?

02:59:10.244 --> 02:59:11.077
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:59:11.077 --> 02:59:11.910
ZAC: No.

02:59:11.910 --> 02:59:12.743
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:59:12.743 --> 02:59:13.886
MATT: Sorry buddy.

02:59:13.886 --> 02:59:16.396
ZAC: So we're not going offline
for the night yet.

02:59:16.396 --> 02:59:17.932
These guys are gonna head out

02:59:17.932 --> 02:59:21.980
and Lucas and I are gonna play
some Hotline Miami 2.

02:59:21.980 --> 02:59:23.293
For an hour, hour and a half.

02:59:23.303 --> 02:59:24.936
MATT: There you go, rock it out.

02:59:24.936 --> 02:59:27.749
ZAC: You know, just to close out the night
with a subscriber-only chat

02:59:27.749 --> 02:59:30.382
to say thank you to our
thousand subscribers.

02:59:30.382 --> 02:59:33.588
And tomorrow night we will be back
with So You Don't Have to,

02:59:33.588 --> 02:59:36.989
which is a show where Hector and Becca
play the weirdest games

02:59:36.989 --> 02:59:40.349
they can find online,
so you don't have to.

02:59:40.349 --> 02:59:41.182
MARISHA: Nice.

02:59:41.182 --> 02:59:42.015
(Matt laughs)

02:59:42.015 --> 02:59:43.486
ZAC: And then we finish off tomorrow night
with Gather Your Party,

02:59:43.486 --> 02:59:45.531
which is just a big party
where we're going to be celebrating

02:59:45.531 --> 02:59:48.302
getting 1000 subscribers,
playing some board games.

02:59:48.302 --> 02:59:50.054
We have a band coming in to play.

02:59:50.054 --> 02:59:50.991
MATT: Awesome.

02:59:50.991 --> 02:59:51.824
ZAC: It's gonna be a good time.

02:59:51.824 --> 02:59:53.815
We might even have a DJ spinning some--
I don't know.

02:59:53.815 --> 02:59:55.143
How do you say it?

02:59:55.143 --> 02:59:55.976
Spinning?

02:59:55.976 --> 02:59:57.039
TRAVIS: Some tunes.

02:59:57.039 --> 02:59:58.182
MATT: Spin tunes.

02:59:58.182 --> 02:59:59.935
TRAVIS: Dropping some dope beats.

02:59:59.935 --> 03:00:02.128
ORION: On the ones and twos.
Ones and twos.

03:00:02.128 --> 03:00:03.952
ZAC: So thank you guys again.

03:00:03.952 --> 03:00:06.672
Lucas, if you wanna go ahead
and roll those videos,

03:00:06.672 --> 03:00:08.145
and we'll get you guys out of here.

03:00:08.145 --> 03:00:09.768
MATT: Thank you guys for watching.

03:00:09.768 --> 03:00:10.551
ALL: Bye!
