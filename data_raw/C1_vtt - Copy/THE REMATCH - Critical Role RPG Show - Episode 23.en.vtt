MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to
Critical Role this week, where us crazy voice

00:00:03.448 --> 00:00:10.725
actors play a nerdy game of Dungeons and Dragons!
I'm so glad you guys could join us. We had a small

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:16.597
hiatus last week as me and Marisha were away at a
cool event in the desert, but we're back. I want

00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:21.466
to give a big thanks and shout-out to Ivan for
running that one-shot game last week. Ivan, you

00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:26.489
kicked ass, you were awesome, and thank you for
carrying the torch when we couldn't be here.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:31.570
Really appreciate that. And for those who tuned in
for him and supporting: thank you guys. Quick

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.041
little shout-out. We had actually one of our
fellow Critters come find us out in the desert

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:39.949
this past week. So a shout-out to our friend Scott
from Boise, Idaho. Operator, thank you so much for

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.316
coming and visiting. It was awesome getting to
chat with you, and it was cool.

00:00:43.316 --> 00:00:44.848
MARISHA: Yeah, that was a surrealist experience.

00:00:44.848 --> 00:00:48.237
MATT: Yeah, we had some cool Critical Role
representation out on the Playas. That was really

00:00:48.237 --> 00:00:53.386
neat. Thank you so much. It was awesome to meet
you, Scott, and thanks for coming by. Other fun

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:59.046
announcements... This is a cool thing that came
up, actually. Hasbro's working with Indiegogo

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:05.203
right now to do essentially the search for their
new face-to-face party game circumstance. So

00:01:05.203 --> 00:01:11.027
they're accepting a bunch of submissions right
now. I think it's nextgreatgamechallenge.com, but

00:01:11.027 --> 00:01:15.045
if you're like me and spent a lot of your youth
spending your summers designing your own card

00:01:15.045 --> 00:01:18.468
games and your own board games and your own party
games and such that just sat there and did

00:01:18.468 --> 00:01:23.221
nothing, now is actually a really cool opportunity
to submit those and possibly get them published.

00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:29.477
Because the person who wins, wins $10,000 on top
of the fact that they get flown out to Hasbro, to

00:01:29.477 --> 00:01:34.277
the actual company building to work on developing
the game with their development team. So that's

00:01:34.277 --> 00:01:38.830
pretty cool. (laughs) So those of you who have
that little game design brain, go ahead and throw

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.671
your ideas out that way. Submit to this! Hopefully
you could win. The thing goes to September 30th?

00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:48.914
You don't have a whole lot of time, so get on it.
But check it out! A possible opportunity for you

00:01:48.914 --> 00:01:54.988
to design your own game. Who knows, maybe one day
we'll be playing it on this Twitch stream. So

00:01:54.988 --> 00:01:56.216
check that out.

00:01:56.216 --> 00:02:02.505
Also, Welovefine is running a t-shirt design
contest for the upcoming Rage of Dragons Dungeons

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:09.510
and Dragons release, and they've asked me to be
one of the judges of that contest. So all you

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.797
people with an artistic bone in your body, go
ahead and design some t-shirts. Go to

00:02:13.797 --> 00:02:19.669
welovefine.com, check out the contest rules for
the Rage of Demons contest. But I'll be judging

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:24.530
your designs! And hopefully if yours is
appreciated by me and all the other judges, you'll

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.066
be getting a cash prize and have your shirts
officially sanctioned by D&amp;amp;D and put on

00:02:28.123 --> 00:02:33.567
welovefine.com, so check that out! That's a cool
thing! I've already seen some great art. Some

00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:36.540
people have floated over to Twitter. If I haven't
responded, it's because I'm a judge and I probably

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.538
shouldn't. (laughs) But everything looks cool, so
thank you guys for your submissions.

00:02:40.538 --> 00:02:43.025
TRAVIS: Do you accept cash bribes?

00:02:43.025 --> 00:02:54.072
MATT: (laughs) No. Other cool announcements. Oh!
Once again, every week we have our hundred sub

00:02:54.198 --> 00:02:58.321
giveaway. Every hundred subs we get, we have a
giveaway with somebody randomly within the chat

00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:04.343
who is actively in the chat. This involves a
picture of the cast, signed, one of our posters

00:03:04.343 --> 00:03:11.596
from our fantastic official artist Kit Buss,
signed, and for a few short giveaways, we'll also

00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:15.477
be giving away a copy of this Pen to Paper
Imaginary Friend book that we received, gifted to

00:03:15.477 --> 00:03:20.760
us by 826LA. It's a book of a collection of
stories from the kids that have been tutored at

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.748
826LA that told stories about their imaginary
friends and what they were like, and their

00:03:25.748 --> 00:03:31.051
adventures. And they had a lot of talented artists
and animators come in and actually illustrate what

00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:37.404
these imaginary friends look like and what their
experiences are with those imaginary friends. So

00:03:37.404 --> 00:03:41.039
we'll be giving one of these away with each one of
those hundred sub giveaways to you guys who have

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:43.041
been so gracious in helping support 826LA.

00:03:43.041 --> 00:03:45.122
MARISHA: Yes. And we went today!

00:03:45.122 --> 00:03:52.661
MATT: We went today to 826LA to deliver a nice,
big, fatty check to them from you guys, and they

00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:56.263
were blown away by it. We got to teach a bunch of
young kids the basics of Dungeons and Dragons, and

00:03:56.263 --> 00:04:00.525
we gave them copies of the books to hopefully
start a few games of their own there,

00:04:00.525 --> 00:04:01.733
so thank you.

00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:06.611
MARISHA: This was such a great experience, and we
took video of it, so hopefully we'll have that

00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:12.028
edited and maybe sometime next week or the week
after, you guys can see and learn a little bit

00:04:12.028 --> 00:04:14.540
about this charity that we support and talk about
every week.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.935
MATT: Yep, we'll have a cool video up. It'll show
you guys our whole experience at 826LA delivering

00:04:17.935 --> 00:04:24.883
and talking to them about everything, so that'll
be fun! Other announcements: This is one of the

00:04:24.883 --> 00:04:28.494
gifts that we're actually talking about at the
start of the stream because we want to utilize it

00:04:28.494 --> 00:04:35.843
through it. A fantastic gentleman by the name of
Jim Donnis sent us custom Vox Machina etched

00:04:35.843 --> 00:04:46.151
glasses. Customized character glass icons. I have
my Dungeon Master glass here. So that's really

00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:50.821
awesome. And also sent us some really, really
nice, quality, expensive dranky-drank.

00:04:50.821 --> 00:04:52.398
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's legit.

00:04:52.398 --> 00:04:58.296
MATT: It's legit. Jim, that's ridiculous. And
amazing. And thank you! We shall progressively

00:04:58.296 --> 00:05:01.840
enjoy it through the stream tonight. So here's to
you, Jim. Thank you very much.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.056
MARISHA and TALIESIN: To Jim!

00:05:03.056 --> 00:05:04.789
TRAVIS: (slurred) To Jim!

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:16.185
MATT: That's tasty. Also, announcements from us!
Any project or game announcements? I know this

00:05:16.185 --> 00:05:19.768
recently sparks the release of the Mad Max game
that just came out.

00:05:19.768 --> 00:05:21.434
MARISHA: Where's Orion?

00:05:21.434 --> 00:05:23.548
MATT: Orion will be here in a second. He's missing
his moment.

00:05:23.548 --> 00:05:25.536
LAURA: But Travis plays the lead villain!

00:05:25.536 --> 00:05:27.318
MATT: Travis is the main villain! Scrotus!

00:05:27.318 --> 00:05:31.951
TRAVIS: Yes, Scabrous Scrotus. Who is in no way
related to Grog.

00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:36.944
MATT: No. He is large and has many curious
accoutrements on his outfit.

00:05:36.944 --> 00:05:40.025
TRAVIS: Yes he does! He has a giant horn on his
crotch. Don't know what that's about.

00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:41.718
ORION: Are we talking about Mad Max?

00:05:41.718 --> 00:05:42.653
MATT: Yes, we are.

00:05:42.653 --> 00:05:43.700
ORION: Hey, he's Scrotus!

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.548
MATT: Yes! And you are?

00:05:45.548 --> 00:05:57.425
ORION: I play Scab and a bunch of war boys. So
check it out! Because I work with this guy here!

00:05:57.425 --> 00:06:03.275
MATT: And I'm a war boy commander and a bunch of
other guys, so you hear a lot of me going,

00:06:03.275 --> 00:06:07.583
"Get that guy!" And a lot of random NPCs giving
quests.

00:06:07.583 --> 00:06:09.402
LAURA: Yeah, I think you hear me barfing a lot
during that game.

00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:12.897
MATT: Oh, man. That was a lot of dry heaving for
like twenty minutes.

00:06:12.897 --> 00:06:14.454
LAURA: Yeah! Crazy.

00:06:14.454 --> 00:06:20.256
MARISHA: Always makes me actually want to barf. It
makes my eyes water and be like, ugh.

00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:27.248
MATT: You know you've achieved it properly when
the director goes, "Okay, no, we got it. Ugh." So

00:06:27.248 --> 00:06:32.542
yeah, Chris put us through the paces on our
varying array of vomiting techniques on that

00:06:32.542 --> 00:06:38.364
project. So enjoy that in Mad Max! Also, same
time, just came out Metal Gear Solid V: The

00:06:38.364 --> 00:06:43.422
Phantom Pain, for those of you who worked on that
one. I know Marisha, if you want to talk about

00:06:43.422 --> 00:06:44.757
your involvement in that?

00:06:44.757 --> 00:06:46.017
MARISHA: Yes, oh-- Sam!

00:06:46.017 --> 00:06:47.870
MATT: We have a Sam! Sam's arrived! Yay!

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:55.935
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm one of the Diamond Dog soldiers
that you can eventually recruit and play as, and

00:06:55.935 --> 00:07:02.964
so you can either shoot at me a lot and kill me a
lot, or you can run around as me. And apparently

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:07.065
once you get me I've got better stats than Big
Boss, which is pretty fucking dope.

00:07:07.065 --> 00:07:12.661
MATT: Damn right, you do. I also voice a lot of
the male Diamond Dog soldiers and enemy soldiers

00:07:12.661 --> 00:07:16.015
throughout the game, so you'll be shooting and
capturing and recruiting a lot of me and Marisha

00:07:16.015 --> 00:07:22.860
throughout the game. Yeah, so check that out. Any
other announcements?

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:29.503
ORION: Yes! Speaking of Mad Max again, because
it's super cool, I've actually partnered with

00:07:29.503 --> 00:07:35.139
Twitch as of ten days ago, so I'm doing my Twitch
and I've been playing the shit out of Mad Max, so

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:39.080
follow me on there! Orionacaba at Twitch, and
check that shit out.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.788
MARISHA: You should play some Metal Gear.

00:07:40.788 --> 00:07:41.721
ORION: Nope!

00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:44.120
TRAVIS: Not until you beat Mad Max.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.544
LAURA: You should play some Borderlands.

00:07:45.544 --> 00:07:50.355
ORION: I'll go to your place and watch you play it
because I want to watch you play your character.

00:07:50.355 --> 00:07:54.412
MATT: Why don't you come to our place to watch
Laura play Borderlands? We'll chain this.

00:07:54.412 --> 00:07:59.150
MARISHA: Guys, why don't we just LAN party and
only play as characters we voice?

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.120
MATT: That's not masturbatory at all.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.645
TRAVIS: No. Not at all.

00:08:02.645 --> 00:08:04.111
ORION: Yeah, that's weird.

00:08:04.111 --> 00:08:05.419
TALIESIN: We can make a little ring.

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:06.665
MARISHA: Yes! Of narcissism!

00:08:06.665 --> 00:08:07.760
MATT: Exactly.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.449
ORION: Ew, that's gross.

00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:11.964
MATT: Cool! Do we have any other announcements?

00:08:11.964 --> 00:08:19.269
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, it's the start of the 2015 NFL
football season. I'll be repping the Dallas

00:08:19.269 --> 00:08:24.502
Cowboys today. They're not playing right now, but
they will be on Sunday. Go Cowboys.

00:08:24.502 --> 00:08:27.801
MATT: Awesome. For the four of you that are
interested in football watching the stream--

00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:30.346
TRAVIS: We all come from different walks, all
right?

00:08:30.346 --> 00:08:34.615
MATT: I know. No, that's awesome. Cool! There we
go.

00:08:34.615 --> 00:08:36.238
TALIESIN: Teach me of your ways.

00:08:36.238 --> 00:08:38.165
TRAVIS: (laughs) My sorcerer's ways.

00:08:38.165 --> 00:08:41.887
MATT: (laughs) I was too much of an indoor kid.
But I'm learning!

00:08:41.887 --> 00:08:43.450
TRAVIS: There goes ball. Chase ball.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.173
LAURA: We're growing! We're learning and growing.

00:08:45.173 --> 00:08:48.793
MATT: I am. I got really into rugby when we were
in New Zealand. Oh, sports I can watch!

00:08:48.793 --> 00:08:51.386
MARISHA: Rugby's dope, man. They're hardcore.

00:08:51.386 --> 00:08:56.155
MATT: Yeah, they hit each other really hard. They
call things a scrum. That sounds like fun.

00:08:56.155 --> 00:08:57.559
TRAVIS: Yeah. That's rugby. Scrum.

00:08:57.559 --> 00:08:58.406
MATT: That's intense, man.

00:08:58.406 --> 00:08:59.549
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's some brutal stuff.

00:08:59.549 --> 00:09:05.260
MATT: Yeah. So we will have a Liam possibly
joining us later in the evening. He had some

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.902
family commitments tonight, but he's going to hope
to try and join us around 8:30 or 9:00,

00:09:07.902 --> 00:09:08.820
if at all.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.793
LAURA: A wild Scanlan coming next to me.

00:09:11.793 --> 00:09:14.236
MATT: Oh no! We got Scanlan jumping ship now!

00:09:14.236 --> 00:09:16.046
SAM: I've never been over here before.

00:09:16.046 --> 00:09:20.057
ORION: How does it feel on that side? When I
played with Will Friedle--

00:09:20.057 --> 00:09:21.799
LAURA: Yeah, I was on that side.

00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:26.132
MARISHA: Yeah, we were switched. That's right.
It's weird. It does feel weird.

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:28.665
SAM: Everything flushes the other way around.

00:09:28.665 --> 00:09:30.758
MATT: That's how it works in this place, yeah.

00:09:30.758 --> 00:09:33.201
MARISHA: Is it colder over there? Are you guys in
winter?

00:09:33.201 --> 00:09:35.560
SAM: Wow, that's so weird!

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.763
MARISHA: I know, it's awesome.

00:09:36.763 --> 00:09:46.751
MATT: Well, anything else? Are we good on
announcements? Perfect! All right. Well then,

00:09:46.751 --> 00:09:51.430
let's go ahead and roll that intro and return.
We'll jump right into the game and kick up this

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.118
next session of Critical Role! See you in just a
minute.

00:09:54.118 --> 00:11:01.297
[dramatic music]

00:11:01.335 --> 00:11:05.444
MATT: Welcome back. Quick announcement that I
forgot: There is a Kickstarter up for the third

00:11:05.444 --> 00:11:09.681
Mythica film, which if you guys haven't watched
it, it's a really awesome indie-budget fantasy

00:11:09.681 --> 00:11:17.722
series, and a bunch of good friends are in it. I
play the main villain, necromancer Zorlock, who

00:11:17.722 --> 00:11:20.875
showed up a little bit in the second film, and the
third one is now going into post, and that's what

00:11:20.875 --> 00:11:22.434
the Kickstarter's asking for your help.

00:11:22.434 --> 00:11:23.600
[no audio]

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.614
MATT: If it's something you want to donate to,
it's a cool project, you get to watch me be all

00:11:25.614 --> 00:11:26.866
evil and cast--

00:11:26.866 --> 00:11:29.248
TRAVIS: I watched it. It's really fun.

00:11:29.248 --> 00:11:33.715
MATT: (laughs) You can see me cast necromantic
spells at Kevin Sorbo. I mean, what more could you

00:11:33.715 --> 00:11:34.642
want, really?

00:11:34.642 --> 00:11:35.572
LAURA: Nothing.

00:11:35.572 --> 00:11:37.024
MATT: Our hair has a battle. It's wonderful.

00:11:37.024 --> 00:11:39.152
ORION: Our mighty DM versus Hercules.

00:11:39.152 --> 00:11:42.964
MATT: Indeed. I remember the first time we met on
set, he came up to me, and goes like, "What's your

00:11:42.964 --> 00:11:54.517
"mother's name?" I still wonder. But anyway. Let us
bring us back to the story. Now, Vox Machina,

00:11:54.517 --> 00:12:02.890
after completing the trials of the Slayer's Take
and acquiring their marking brand as essence of

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:08.606
them joining the actual guild itself, meeting the
gynosphinx that is currently responsible--

00:12:08.606 --> 00:12:09.914
LAURA: (chuckles)

00:12:09.914 --> 00:12:16.792
MATT: Such children. Responsible for the
development and the progression of the guild

00:12:16.792 --> 00:12:26.574
itself, they found themselves having Pike join
them for about a week's time while the landscape

00:12:26.574 --> 00:12:32.531
of her temple to Sarenrae was being cleansed of a
curse, and the group decided to follow through on

00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:38.967
their promise to aid Keyleth on her Aramente to
find the Pyrah people to the far southwest of

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:39.949
Vasselheim.

00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:42.212
LAURA: Ugh!

00:12:42.212 --> 00:12:43.654
TRAVIS: I'm burping garlic.

00:12:43.654 --> 00:12:50.704
MATT: Ugh. Garlic. Stinking Cloud over there. You
thought he wasn't a caster. They made their way to

00:12:50.704 --> 00:12:59.417
the mountains, eventually to the actual Pyrah
tribe itself, where they underwent a trial through

00:12:59.417 --> 00:13:05.512
the elemental plane of fire. Battled some of the
druids, the Pyrah themselves, in elemental fire

00:13:05.512 --> 00:13:11.887
form, combated against time through a cinder storm
as they attempted to escape, and managed to do so

00:13:11.887 --> 00:13:17.236
with their lives, and in doing so gained the
blessing of the Aramente for Keyleth from the

00:13:17.236 --> 00:13:25.156
Pyrah tribe, as well as a blessing from the main
druid as well, as a spark stone. And

00:13:25.156 --> 00:13:30.572
returned to Vasselheim, Pike then said her
goodbyes again, returning to help the restoration

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:37.610
of the temple of Sarenrae, and you've all been
left to your devices now. So. As you all awaken

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:43.953
the next morning within the guildhall itself, your
journey and your path is your own to take.

00:13:43.953 --> 00:13:46.976
TRAVIS: We wake the next morning. Beard check,
please.

00:13:46.976 --> 00:13:50.076
MATT: Beard check. (laughs)

00:13:50.076 --> 00:13:51.444
TRAVIS: Zero. Or ten?

00:13:51.444 --> 00:13:52.511
LAURA: That's zero.

00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:53.601
SAM: That's good.

00:13:53.601 --> 00:13:55.199
MARISHA: It depends.

00:13:55.199 --> 00:13:56.900
TRAVIS: That's a hundred.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.867
MARISHA: Are you serious?

00:13:57.867 --> 00:13:59.327
TRAVIS: That's the second time that's happened.

00:13:59.327 --> 00:14:03.987
MARISHA: All you had to have rolled was a nine or
anything other than a zero. That's all you had

00:14:03.987 --> 00:14:05.166
to-- anything.

00:14:05.166 --> 00:14:10.430
MATT: If this had been the second edition
Encyclopedia Magica, you would've gotten the most

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:18.221
broken artifact ever. You rolled two hundreds.
With a tiny methodical squeak, your pores produce

00:14:18.221 --> 00:14:24.663
but a few random molecules of hair-like material
that then puff in the air around you.

00:14:24.663 --> 00:14:29.253
TRAVIS: Is it at least rough? Like, you know, he
needs to shave, it's so rough.

00:14:29.253 --> 00:14:31.151
LAURA: Nah, it's smooth as a baby's bottom.

00:14:31.151 --> 00:14:32.865
TALIESIN: Well-oiled.

00:14:32.865 --> 00:14:37.570
LAURA: Fine leather. That's what your face feels
like.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:43.354
ORION: It's still 24 hours since we had the feast,
right? It still counts as the same time?

00:14:43.354 --> 00:14:48.446
MATT: The travel back to the town took about two
and a half, three days, so that's been long past

00:14:48.446 --> 00:14:53.013
the feast. So the benefits of the Heroes' Feast
have already been washed from your system.

00:14:53.013 --> 00:14:55.614
SAM: Where am I?

00:14:55.614 --> 00:15:05.133
MATT: Where are you? That's a very good question.
As you returned, tired from the venture, went to

00:15:05.133 --> 00:15:08.751
sleep. You have spent the past week or so--

00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:10.190
SAM: On my own.

00:15:10.323 --> 00:15:16.573
MATT: On your own, essentially finding one of the
various establishments in the city that can aid

00:15:16.628 --> 00:15:22.910
you through your sore muscles through the help of
feminine companionship-- or other types of

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:27.525
companionship; whatever your preference may be.
But upon leaving, realize that your party had left

00:15:27.525 --> 00:15:29.508
and been gone for some time.

00:15:29.508 --> 00:15:33.404
SAM: Where are they? Where am I?

00:15:33.404 --> 00:15:37.569
MATT: You've just now found word they've returned
to the Slayer's Take guildhall, and you've made

00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:39.743
your way in that direction this bright morning.

00:15:39.743 --> 00:15:41.195
TRAVIS: Because it's free to stay there.

00:15:41.195 --> 00:15:42.465
LAURA: Yeah, we can stay there for free.

00:15:42.465 --> 00:15:43.486
SAM: Hello!

00:15:43.486 --> 00:15:44.965
LAURA and MARISHA: Scanlan!

00:15:44.965 --> 00:15:46.918
SAM: Where have you guys been?

00:15:46.918 --> 00:15:49.214
LAURA: Oh, Scanlan. You've just missed Pike!

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:54.354
SAM: What?! Pike? Pike was here?

00:15:54.354 --> 00:15:58.390
MARISHA: We took a field trip with her.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:02.870
SAM: What are you talking about? Why didn't you
call me? We have an earring!

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:08.800
ORION: I used it twice, and you said, stop
bothering me, Tiberius.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.152
SAM: Well, I-- (sighs)

00:16:10.152 --> 00:16:15.466
TALIESIN: We were hearing very weird things from
the other end of that ear piece

00:16:15.466 --> 00:16:18.316
ORION: Though he definitely said my name and told
me to stop.

00:16:18.316 --> 00:16:22.621
SAM: You didn't lead with Pike, though! You should
have said, Pike's here. Hey, Pike's here.

00:16:22.621 --> 00:16:24.032
LAURA: You probably should have done that.

00:16:24.032 --> 00:16:25.129
ORION: My bad.

00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:27.122
SAM: (frustrated noise)

00:16:27.122 --> 00:16:28.202
ORION: Sorry about that.

00:16:28.202 --> 00:16:32.238
SAM: I mean, I was having a fun time, but I
would've dropped everything to be with Pike.

00:16:32.238 --> 00:16:35.167
ORION: Well, a Stormwind likes to finish a
sentence, and I apparently need to start a

00:16:35.167 --> 00:16:37.756
sentence correctly for you to hold your attention
long enough.

00:16:37.756 --> 00:16:41.192
SAM: Don't bury the lede. Pike first. Always Pike
first.

00:16:41.192 --> 00:16:42.241
ORION: Right. Sorry.

00:16:42.241 --> 00:16:43.902
SAM: I wasn't even in a brothel.

00:16:43.902 --> 00:16:45.444
LAURA: Oh, you weren't?

00:16:45.444 --> 00:16:49.766
SAM: I walked toward the brothel, but then I
bumped into Zahra. Remember Zahra?

00:16:49.766 --> 00:16:50.946
TALIESIN: Oh, Zahra!

00:16:50.946 --> 00:16:56.321
SAM: She invited me over. We talked all night. One
thing led to another-- nothing untoward-- but we

00:16:56.321 --> 00:17:02.288
just had a nice slumber party. It was lovely. It
was me and a couple of tieflings. Three, I think.

00:17:02.288 --> 00:17:07.950
We were doing each other's hair, telling stories,
playing songs. It was wonderful!

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.135
TRAVIS: Can I roll to see if he's bullshitting?

00:17:10.135 --> 00:17:12.898
MATT: You can go ahead and make a-- this would be
an insight.

00:17:12.898 --> 00:17:16.559
TRAVIS: Yeah! Grog insight check! Modifier is
zero! That's a nine.

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:18.314
(laughter)

00:17:18.314 --> 00:17:25.161
MATT: You are enthralled by his tale. Your elbows
are on the edge of the bedspread right now with

00:17:25.161 --> 00:17:26.858
your hands clasped--

00:17:26.858 --> 00:17:28.100
TRAVIS: Are my feet behind me, crisscrossing?

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.959
MATT: You are this close to a breakdown from
Grease. It's pretty fantastic.

00:17:31.959 --> 00:17:34.477
TRAVIS: (singing) Tell me more, tell me more...

00:17:34.477 --> 00:17:39.181
SAM: It was great. We had a great PG night.

00:17:39.181 --> 00:17:43.567
MARISHA: Sounds like exactly what you needed.

00:17:43.567 --> 00:17:46.073
LAURA: Well, then. That sounds like a wonderful
time. It's all right that you missed Pike.

00:17:46.073 --> 00:17:49.713
SAM: Yeah, except I would have dropped everything
to come to see the woman I love, the woman of my

00:17:49.713 --> 00:17:56.374
dreams, the woman I will marry and bear children
with. I don't know if she'll bear mine or I'll

00:17:56.374 --> 00:17:57.582
bear hers.

00:17:57.582 --> 00:17:59.571
ORION: Yes. How does it work with gnomes?

00:17:59.571 --> 00:18:01.017
SAM: Gnomes, it's tricky.

00:18:01.017 --> 00:18:03.504
ORION: Yes, I've never seen a gnome birth,
before.

00:18:03.504 --> 00:18:05.046
SAM: You never know.

00:18:05.046 --> 00:18:06.771
TALIESIN: Would it help if there were trolls?

00:18:06.771 --> 00:18:08.882
SAM: Oh, don't get me started.

00:18:08.882 --> 00:18:12.405
TALIESIN: All right, so if there were trolls, it
would be better that you missed everything. There

00:18:12.405 --> 00:18:15.181
weren't trolls, but if there had been, it would
have been better.

00:18:15.181 --> 00:18:16.976
SAM: Well, at least we're all together again.

00:18:16.976 --> 00:18:18.662
MARISHA: We got to meet my family!

00:18:18.662 --> 00:18:19.688
SAM: Wait, what?!

00:18:19.688 --> 00:18:20.522
MARISHA: Yeah!

00:18:20.522 --> 00:18:21.707
SAM: I missed everything.

00:18:21.707 --> 00:18:25.539
LAURA: What did you do for all the days we've been
gone now?

00:18:25.539 --> 00:18:33.857
SAM: This was a long slumber party. We just kept
going and going, and at one point, I was like,

00:18:33.857 --> 00:18:38.946
okay, I'll see you-- oh, there's another meal?
Okay, I'll stick around for another day. And we

00:18:38.946 --> 00:18:40.325
just kept going.

00:18:40.325 --> 00:18:42.083
TRAVIS: Did you do nails?

00:18:42.083 --> 00:18:45.423
SAM: We did. Not my hands. Just my toenails.

00:18:45.423 --> 00:18:46.426
LAURA: All right.

00:18:46.426 --> 00:18:52.253
SAM: We braided hair. We connected.

00:18:52.253 --> 00:18:53.425
LAURA: That's wonderful.

00:18:53.425 --> 00:18:54.924
TRAVIS: Connected.

00:18:54.924 --> 00:19:00.373
SAM: Well, at least we're all back. We can get on
the flying carpet and go somewhere fun.

00:19:00.373 --> 00:19:01.623
LAURA: Oh no.

00:19:01.623 --> 00:19:06.789
TRAVIS: Who wants to--

00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:10.005
LAURA: Scanlan, you've missed everything!

00:19:10.005 --> 00:19:14.934
TRAVIS: Maybe we should let Keyleth explain where
the flying carpet went.

00:19:14.934 --> 00:19:16.981
TALIESIN: Yes, Keyleth. Where is the flying
carpet?

00:19:16.981 --> 00:19:18.600
MARISHA: Why do I have to explain it?

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.202
TRAVIS: You're right. Tiberius, where did the
flying carpet go?

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:25.437
ORION: It's right here. I open my Bag of Holding.
(swoosh) It just doesn't fly anymore.

00:19:25.437 --> 00:19:26.734
SAM: You have a Bag of Holding?

00:19:26.734 --> 00:19:31.826
ORION: I went to Draconia for like two minutes and
picked one up.

00:19:31.826 --> 00:19:32.972
SAM: That's really far.

00:19:32.972 --> 00:19:36.778
ORION: Oh. Well, I teleported. I went there, came
back.

00:19:36.778 --> 00:19:44.313
LAURA: So they killed the carpet. It lives no
more. They also spent a lot of money. But hey,

00:19:44.313 --> 00:19:47.175
they didn't die, and that's a good thing.

00:19:47.175 --> 00:19:48.678
SAM: That is a good thing.

00:19:48.678 --> 00:19:50.438
MARISHA: And we fought a devil.

00:19:50.438 --> 00:19:51.599
LAURA: A demon.

00:19:51.599 --> 00:19:53.131
SAM: Whoa! The devil?

00:19:53.131 --> 00:19:55.002
ORION: No, a rakshasa.

00:19:55.002 --> 00:19:58.587
TALIESIN: It seems that an enormous amount of
alcohol has given you some perspective. I'm very

00:19:58.587 --> 00:20:00.351
proud of you. Well done.

00:20:00.351 --> 00:20:01.543
LAURA: Thank you.

00:20:01.543 --> 00:20:09.631
SAM: Well, thank you for catching me up, fellows.
What's our mission now? What are we doing now?

00:20:09.631 --> 00:20:11.828
LAURA: That is a good question.

00:20:11.828 --> 00:20:16.354
ORION: I have a suggestion. First I'm going to
bring up Lockheed. Keyleth,

00:20:16.354 --> 00:20:18.866
if you think you could help?

00:20:18.866 --> 00:20:24.993
SAM: What? I was gone for a day! There's a dragon
now?

00:20:24.993 --> 00:20:29.568
ORION: I'm going to take him out of his cage and
put him on the table here.

00:20:29.568 --> 00:20:33.384
MARISHA: Aw, he's got puppy breath. Oh, yes you
do. Yes you do.

00:20:33.384 --> 00:20:35.511
MATT: It is slightly worse than puppy breath.

00:20:35.511 --> 00:20:38.828
MARISHA: You want me to cure him of poison?

00:20:38.828 --> 00:20:47.777
ORION: He's diseased. You can maybe see if you
could perhaps use your medicine strengths to see

00:20:47.777 --> 00:20:48.977
what the problem is.

00:20:48.977 --> 00:20:52.155
MARISHA: I mean, the Heroes' Feast would have
worked.

00:20:52.155 --> 00:20:55.415
ORION: Yes, I know. That's why I asked earlier as
the other guy.

00:20:55.415 --> 00:21:01.654
LAURA: We did not have him with us then? We didn't
have him with us when we had the feast?

00:21:01.654 --> 00:21:02.725
ORION: No.

00:21:02.725 --> 00:21:06.549
LAURA: You didn't think of him at the time?

00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:08.875
ORION: I said I fed him, but I didn't say what I
fed him.

00:21:08.875 --> 00:21:12.570
TALIESIN: I have a strange thought.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:13.550
LAURA: What?

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.739
TALIESIN: When was the last time we went home?

00:21:15.862 --> 00:21:20.686
LAURA: Well, okay. Here's the thing. If we're
going to go home-- Emon.

00:21:20.686 --> 00:21:21.947
TALIESIN: Greyskull.

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:27.457
LAURA: Right. If we're going to go home, I would
really, really like to stop by Kraghammer.

00:21:27.457 --> 00:21:28.805
TALIESIN: And pick up our money.

00:21:28.805 --> 00:21:31.038
LAURA: Yes. 25,000 gold.

00:21:31.038 --> 00:21:36.248
TRAVIS: If we're going to leave, could I make a
small request?

00:21:36.248 --> 00:21:38.574
TALIESIN: You want to try again, don't you?

00:21:38.574 --> 00:21:40.859
TRAVIS: I have a bit of a chip on my shoulder.

00:21:40.859 --> 00:21:42.143
MARISHA: Oh!

00:21:42.143 --> 00:21:50.265
TRAVIS: Would you mind terribly if I maybe went
out to the street and picked a fight?

00:21:50.265 --> 00:21:51.546
TALIESIN: Oh, give me strength.

00:21:51.546 --> 00:21:57.939
MARISHA: Wait, go out on the street? You're not
going to chase down what's-his-butt?

00:21:57.939 --> 00:21:59.316
TRAVIS: I want Kern.

00:21:59.316 --> 00:22:00.923
MARISHA: Okay, we're going to find Kern.

00:22:00.923 --> 00:22:02.975
SAM: Are you sure about this?

00:22:02.975 --> 00:22:04.573
TRAVIS: I'm sure.

00:22:04.573 --> 00:22:08.107
MARISHA: Hang on, are we going to go find Kern and
do this with rules, or we going to

00:22:08.107 --> 00:22:09.780
do this without rules?

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.308
SAM: Without rules, you would win.

00:22:11.308 --> 00:22:14.445
TRAVIS: I can't do it. I have to do it by the
rules.

00:22:14.445 --> 00:22:16.938
LAURA: So you want to go in the Crucible again.

00:22:16.938 --> 00:22:25.656
TRAVIS: Yeah. Is there a tavern downstairs or
anywhere they'd have cups or wineskins?

00:22:25.656 --> 00:22:32.481
MATT: Within the guildhall, there is a mess hall
area. A kitchen would have cups, but it's not a

00:22:32.481 --> 00:22:33.637
full tavern.

00:22:33.637 --> 00:22:35.815
LAURA: Tiberius, do you have any wineskins or
anything?

00:22:35.815 --> 00:22:37.649
ORION: Excuse me?

00:22:37.649 --> 00:22:39.046
LAURA: Do you have a wineskin?

00:22:39.046 --> 00:22:41.648
ORION: Oh, I'm sorry. I was waiting on my first
request before.

00:22:41.648 --> 00:22:43.110
SAM: Oh, what was your first request?

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:47.395
ORION: To see if Keyleth could do anything, but a
wineskin? Yes.

00:22:47.395 --> 00:22:48.817
LAURA and TRAVIS: Oh, thank you.

00:22:48.817 --> 00:22:55.100
MARISHA: Can I do a check to see if I can tell
what Lockheed has? What kind of disease?

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.124
MATT: Sure. Go ahead and make a medicine check.

00:22:57.124 --> 00:22:59.438
SAM: Oh, it's sick? Get me away from it.

00:22:59.438 --> 00:23:00.864
MARISHA: 21.

00:23:00.864 --> 00:23:07.433
MATT: 21. Looking at Lockheed, you get the feeling
that his disease essentially comes from a

00:23:07.433 --> 00:23:13.647
continuous time period of poor meat being
presented as a meal option. It's less of a magical

00:23:13.647 --> 00:23:17.787
or any sort of unnatural disease. It's just
something that is passing through his system.

00:23:17.787 --> 00:23:19.025
ORION: Emaciated?

00:23:19.025 --> 00:23:24.446
MATT: Not too emaciated. More that some bad meat
has found its system, which means without

00:23:24.446 --> 00:23:28.655
treatment over time, his health could diminish.
However, if the food you've been feeding him has

00:23:28.655 --> 00:23:33.807
been a decent level, if this continues, it might
clear. It could be aided through the use of simple

00:23:33.807 --> 00:23:36.428
healing salves and/or natural remedies.

00:23:36.428 --> 00:23:42.281
MARISHA: Can I make a few Goodberries for him and
feed him a few more Goodberries?

00:23:42.281 --> 00:23:43.566
MATT: Sure.

00:23:43.566 --> 00:23:45.042
TALIESIN: Why not great berries?

00:23:45.042 --> 00:23:48.716
MARISHA: Well, I guess that's a matter of opinion,
Percy.

00:23:48.716 --> 00:23:55.292
ORION: As far as the matters at hand: I, of
course, Grog, encourage your violence. And

00:23:55.292 --> 00:23:58.481
Taliesin, I do quite like the idea of going back
to Emon--

00:23:58.481 --> 00:24:00.871
LAURA: Who did you just-- who did you just--

00:24:00.871 --> 00:24:05.926
TALIESIN: You just NPCed me. Just NPCed me all
over the place.

00:24:05.926 --> 00:24:09.326
ORION: Oh, sorry. I'm sorry, speaking Draconic
again. Percy.

00:24:09.326 --> 00:24:14.547
TALIESIN: Taliesin is my mother's name, please.
No.

00:24:14.547 --> 00:24:17.313
ORION: Sorry. No, that's not your mother's name.

00:24:17.313 --> 00:24:20.650
TALIESIN: It's not my mother's name. She wasn't
well. Carry on.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:22.712
LAURA: What was your mother's name?

00:24:22.712 --> 00:24:27.018
ORION: I'm sorry. Percival. I go over to Percival
and I give him a hug.

00:24:27.018 --> 00:24:28.707
TALIESIN: Oh god.

00:24:28.707 --> 00:24:30.411
ORION: Sorry, I'm scaly.

00:24:30.411 --> 00:24:32.781
TALIESIN: It's all right. We didn't touch in my
family. Go ahead.

00:24:32.781 --> 00:24:38.475
ORION: I like the idea of going back to Emon, but
before that, I do believe we should go back to

00:24:38.475 --> 00:24:40.325
Kraghammer and collect our gold.

00:24:40.325 --> 00:24:41.268
TALIESIN and LAURA: Yes.

00:24:41.268 --> 00:24:42.473
ORION: Did we say that already?

00:24:42.473 --> 00:24:43.437
TALIESIN and LAURA: We did.

00:24:43.437 --> 00:24:45.020
ORION: Wonderful. I was concerned about Lockheed.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.574
MARISHA: So much has happened.

00:24:46.574 --> 00:24:48.532
ORION: I'm going to put him on my shoulder.

00:24:48.532 --> 00:24:51.245
TRAVIS: Did you say you encourage my violence?

00:24:51.245 --> 00:24:52.020
ORION: Of course.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.610
TRAVIS: I take off running out the room.

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:56.069
(laughter)

00:24:56.069 --> 00:24:59.029
MARISHA: Oh, Tiberius. You have to be careful. You
have to be responsible--

00:24:59.029 --> 00:25:00.570
TRAVIS: Was there a window in the room?

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.586
MATT: No, not in this one.

00:25:02.586 --> 00:25:03.913
TRAVIS: Okay, just checking.

00:25:03.913 --> 00:25:06.913
TALIESIN: Was there a Looney Tunes hole in the
wall?

00:25:06.913 --> 00:25:10.151
(laughter)

00:25:10.151 --> 00:25:13.700
MATT: So as Grog bounds off into the distance, do
you guys give chase?

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.079
ORION and TALIESIN: Yes!

00:25:15.079 --> 00:25:17.389
MATT: You get out into the main thoroughfare.

00:25:17.389 --> 00:25:20.569
MARISHA: We really need to make that leash for
him, like we said we were going to.

00:25:20.569 --> 00:25:24.664
MATT: As you make your way to the main
thoroughfare, you look over and you catch the

00:25:24.664 --> 00:25:30.189
image of the distant goliath heading northward
towards the Braving Grounds, just plowing through

00:25:30.189 --> 00:25:34.022
the crowd. You see a couple people that are
knocked flat onto their ass, like head shaking,

00:25:34.022 --> 00:25:36.699
"what just happened?" as he just goes bounding
into the distance.

00:25:36.699 --> 00:25:38.952
MARISHA: Follow the trail of distressed people!

00:25:38.952 --> 00:25:44.031
ORION: I give chase. I give myself Fly so I can go
over the crowd.

00:25:44.031 --> 00:25:50.857
MATT: As you glide over the crowd, you can see a
few Bastions glance up and narrow their eyes and

00:25:50.857 --> 00:25:52.717
begin whispering to themselves.

00:25:52.717 --> 00:25:57.181
ORION: It's fine! I realize what I'm doing, and I
stop.

00:25:57.181 --> 00:26:04.873
TALIESIN: That's going on your tombstone: I
realize what I'm doing, and I stop.

00:26:04.873 --> 00:26:11.499
MATT: As you enter the group, you, Percy, thanks
to him, notice that there are now no less than

00:26:11.499 --> 00:26:15.274
five Bastions keeping a 30-foot distance walking and
following behind Tiberius.

00:26:15.326 --> 00:26:22.967
LAURA: I go up and I tell Tiberius, maybe it's
best just to keep a low profile for a while. And I

00:26:22.967 --> 00:26:27.213
turn around and wave at the Bastions.

00:26:27.213 --> 00:26:29.277
TALIESIN: It's all right. He's from Emon.

00:26:29.277 --> 00:26:32.691
MATT: As soon as you wave and make that
interaction, they break off in two and three and

00:26:32.691 --> 00:26:34.799
go in different directions and disappear into the
crowd.

00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:36.647
LAURA: Cool. That was fun.

00:26:36.647 --> 00:26:38.250
TALIESIN: Hunter's Mark one of them.

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.709
LAURA: Yeah, I'll Hunter's Mark one of them.

00:26:39.709 --> 00:26:41.751
ORION: Do they feel that?

00:26:41.751 --> 00:26:44.152
LAURA: Oh, wait. Can they feel that?

00:26:44.152 --> 00:26:47.123
MATT: Go ahead and make a sleight-of-hand check on
this.

00:26:47.123 --> 00:26:57.197
LAURA: Oh gosh. Wait, which one should I roll
first? Okay. Hold on.

00:26:57.248 --> 00:26:59.442
Natural 20, what!

00:26:59.442 --> 00:27:09.984
MATT: You are the anti-Wheaton as of late. It's
kind of amazing. All right, yeah. You Hunter's

00:27:09.984 --> 00:27:14.115
Mark one of the Bastions who wanders off in the
crowd, and you have a very good idea of where he

00:27:14.115 --> 00:27:18.398
and/or the cluster that's with him is moving. As
you guys progress, following this path that Grog

00:27:18.443 --> 00:27:24.136
is carving through the crowd, heading for the main
bazaar area at the center of the Quad Roads

00:27:24.136 --> 00:27:30.758
district, heading northwestern, up into the Braving
Grounds of Vasselheim, you can also sense that

00:27:30.758 --> 00:27:35.708
they are following, though at a good 60-foot
distance, keeping an eye on the red-scaled

00:27:35.708 --> 00:27:42.373
dragonborn that then flew out into the open air of
the midday sun, with his tinier dragon, his very

00:27:42.373 --> 00:27:48.340
meta dragon-on-dragon action. You continue pushing
into the Braving Grounds area. You can see, now,

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:54.623
giant black smokestacks that are billowing up from
the various blacksmithies, and there is a large

00:27:54.623 --> 00:27:59.321
industrial iron complex that is used in the mining
and reforming of all the weapons and armor that go

00:27:59.321 --> 00:28:03.998
to the Bastions of the city here in the Braving
Grounds. You make your way up towards the Bellows'

00:28:03.998 --> 00:28:09.529
Respite Inn, to where the Crucible itself is held
in the center. As you approach, it is midday.

00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:14.429
There's no crowd gathered. The Crucible is
currently empty and left on its own. You glance

00:28:14.429 --> 00:28:17.997
about for a second, and there's nobody here
running any sort of fight ring.

00:28:17.997 --> 00:28:20.352
SAM: Damn it, you'll have to come back.

00:28:20.352 --> 00:28:24.106
TRAVIS: (shouting) Kern!

00:28:24.106 --> 00:28:27.480
MATT: As you're shouting into the air, a few
people nearby--

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:35.368
TRAVIS: And the Star Trek reference is good. His
name's Kern; it's fun.

00:28:35.368 --> 00:28:42.557
MATT: Nearby individuals drop their stuff and look
over as this billowing, deep goliath voice fills

00:28:42.557 --> 00:28:51.697
the air around the center of this mildly
business-as-usual road vicinity. Suddenly, a few

00:28:51.697 --> 00:28:55.679
individuals come looking out from inside the
Bellows' Respite Inn. It has a tavern portion to

00:28:55.679 --> 00:29:02.771
the front. One of them is Once-Lucky Ned, who is
the person that runs the tavern. He's a human

00:29:02.771 --> 00:29:11.025
barkeep that wanders out and, "You! Philip!
Yelling Kern?" And you see this look on his face.

00:29:11.025 --> 00:29:16.152
TRAVIS: Bring me the body of Kern.

00:29:16.152 --> 00:29:18.564
LAURA: Alive! Alive.

00:29:18.564 --> 00:29:20.156
ORION: He wants to fight him.

00:29:20.156 --> 00:29:24.872
MATT: He cocks his head a little bit at you. "Just
a moment. Stay right there."

00:29:24.872 --> 00:29:26.306
And he runs back inside.

00:29:26.306 --> 00:29:28.488
SAM: There's going to be a street fight!

00:29:28.488 --> 00:29:33.883
MARISHA: I hear Scanlan say that and I run out and
I say, (shouting) fight!

00:29:33.883 --> 00:29:38.463
MATT: At this point, other members of the tavern
are starting to come out, tankards in hand, like,

00:29:38.463 --> 00:29:45.353
"what's going on?" They see you. "Oh! There's
going to be a fight at the Crucible!" You hear the

00:29:45.353 --> 00:29:49.059
shouts going off the nearby houses; it's echoing,
like town crier to town crier. You're hearing

00:29:49.059 --> 00:29:54.345
voices echo throughout the entirety of the Braving
Grounds: people preparing for this midday

00:29:54.345 --> 00:30:01.284
unexpected throwdown. At this point, you see a few
of the Bastions wearing the armor that is geared

00:30:01.284 --> 00:30:04.538
towards Kord, the god of strength that runs this
portion of Vasselheim.

00:30:04.538 --> 00:30:06.095
LAURA: The ones that I'm keeping an eye on?

00:30:06.095 --> 00:30:08.068
MATT: No, the ones that you're keeping an eye on
were from the Quad Roads, and they're still

00:30:08.068 --> 00:30:12.306
staying back. One of them, the one that you've
marked, is around the corner, just keeping an eye

00:30:12.306 --> 00:30:16.005
on everybody, but he's mainly keeping to himself.
He does stand out like a sore thumb because his

00:30:16.005 --> 00:30:25.637
armor is darker and based around Erathis, whereas
here the Bastions that are under Kord's vision

00:30:25.637 --> 00:30:29.336
have more of a red, dark, almost rusty look to
their armor.

00:30:29.336 --> 00:30:35.410
Anyway, as the shouts continue, some of the Kord
Bastions gather, one of which you recognize as the

00:30:35.446 --> 00:30:42.901
one who was acting as the bookie the first time
you came to the Crucible. And he looks-- wiping

00:30:42.901 --> 00:30:47.048
sleep from his eyes-- he looks like he just got
into his armor and rushed out here for about ten

00:30:47.048 --> 00:30:49.913
minutes since you just came out here and shouted
your challenge to the sky.

00:30:49.913 --> 00:30:51.601
He rushes out for a second.

00:30:51.601 --> 00:31:02.699
"You! Hey, am I to hear properly that you are 
challenging our standing champion once again?"

00:31:02.699 --> 00:31:04.513
TRAVIS: Aye, you heard right.

00:31:04.513 --> 00:31:06.743
MATT: "Midday, now, under the noonday sun?"

00:31:06.743 --> 00:31:11.078
TRAVIS: Aye, where everyone can see, and he can't
hide.

00:31:11.078 --> 00:31:19.864
MATT: He glances over to another Bastion that's to
his left. "Get Kern. Now." He rushes off and he

00:31:19.887 --> 00:31:26.828
looks back to you. "Well, then. A fight we're
going to have." At this point now, there's

00:31:26.828 --> 00:31:30.206
probably about 20, 25 people that are beginning to
gather around the outskirts of the Crucible around

00:31:30.206 --> 00:31:35.197
you. "Oh, it's Philip! Philip's showing down
with Kern!" There's all these different whispers

00:31:35.239 --> 00:31:39.121
now going throughout the crowd as the rest of you
gather. The Bastion that you've been following

00:31:39.121 --> 00:31:43.889
backs off and stays further back, and is slowly
keeping a distance further away as the crowd

00:31:43.889 --> 00:31:48.381
begins to gather, wanting to stay inconspicuous
amongst all this chaos and

00:31:48.381 --> 00:31:49.594
rabble you guys have collected.

00:31:49.594 --> 00:31:53.417
MARISHA: I join in with everybody else. Yeah, did
you see that, Kern's fighting Philip!

00:31:53.417 --> 00:31:55.149
TALIESIN: Why are you telling me this? Of course I
know.

00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:57.120
MARISHA: Kern's fighting--

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.187
ORION: I also know.

00:31:58.187 --> 00:31:59.191
MARISHA: Shit.

00:31:59.191 --> 00:32:05.561
LAURA: Can I try, subtly, to pass off my ring of
AC to Grog?

00:32:05.561 --> 00:32:10.000
MATT: Grog, do you have any enchantment of
protection, currently?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.134
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:32:11.134 --> 00:32:12.132
MATT: You do not?

00:32:12.132 --> 00:32:13.063
TRAVIS: I don't.

00:32:13.063 --> 00:32:15.172
MATT: On the ring, does it say attunement
required?

00:32:15.172 --> 00:32:20.843
LAURA: No. It doesn't, I don't think. Hold on, let
me look.

00:32:20.843 --> 00:32:23.440
MATT: I can look it up for you, if need be.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.628
LAURA: Ring of Protection.

00:32:24.628 --> 00:32:26.812
TRAVIS: Yeah, my Belt of Dwarvenkind is the only
thing, but that's all.

00:32:26.812 --> 00:32:30.246
LAURA: It just says plus two bonus to AC and
saving throw-- oh, requires attunement.

00:32:30.246 --> 00:32:32.996
MATT: Yeah, you have to take time to go ahead and
attune to the magical item.

00:32:32.996 --> 00:32:34.687
LAURA: Damn it! I'm sorry, Grog.

00:32:34.687 --> 00:32:35.583
TRAVIS: It's all right.

00:32:35.583 --> 00:32:37.893
LAURA: You shouldn't have taken off running!

00:32:37.893 --> 00:32:42.909
MATT: (laughs) About 20 minutes pass by as the
crowd is now gathered, about 50 to 60 people.

00:32:42.909 --> 00:32:47.360
Apparently, word of your last battle has gotten
around, and now there's this fevered pitch of

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:51.796
interest. People have dropped what they're doing
and the smokestacks you can see have slowly turned

00:32:51.796 --> 00:32:58.680
to a dribble as everyone who's working the nearby
forges and/or smelting irons have rushed out here

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.359
to see this battle and dropped what they're doing.
This has turned into full-on,

00:33:02.359 --> 00:33:04.703
"Morpheus is fighting Neo."

00:33:04.703 --> 00:33:10.672
TRAVIS: I turn to the bookie, and I take out my
entire coin purse, and I throw it at him.

00:33:10.672 --> 00:33:13.827
ORION: I use my Mage Hand--

00:33:13.827 --> 00:33:15.151
LAURA: No, don't use magic!

00:33:15.151 --> 00:33:16.664
ORION: Oh no, I don't! I don't do that!

00:33:16.664 --> 00:33:20.190
TALIESIN: We whack him on the head before he
starts to do the hand. Stop it!

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:25.687
TRAVIS: I throw him the coin purse and I say, I
expect to see that doubled when I get out. And I

00:33:25.687 --> 00:33:27.855
jump into the pit before Kern even arrives.

00:33:27.855 --> 00:33:33.130
MATT: You leap and the whole crowd goes (cheering)
and this series of shouting screams surround the

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:35.606
air around you. He grabs the coin purse-- how much
is in that coin purse?

00:33:35.606 --> 00:33:40.010
TRAVIS: According to this, it's eleven-- that
can't be right, can it?

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:41.325
SAM: 11,000?

00:33:41.325 --> 00:33:42.477
LAURA: Personal funds?!

00:33:42.477 --> 00:33:44.477
MATT: Your personal funds, not what's in the Bag
of Holding.

00:33:44.477 --> 00:33:45.653
TRAVIS: 1,363.

00:33:45.653 --> 00:33:48.634
MATT: 1,363 gold pieces.

00:33:48.634 --> 00:33:52.866
LAURA: That's normal. He probably has more than
that.

00:33:52.866 --> 00:33:54.384
MARISHA: You should start charging admission at
the door.

00:33:54.384 --> 00:33:56.537
SAM: I run up. There's a bookie here?

00:33:56.537 --> 00:33:58.073
MATT: There is a bookie.

00:33:58.073 --> 00:34:03.058
SAM: I run up to him and very subtly say, I'd like
a hundred against Grog, please.

00:34:03.058 --> 00:34:05.186
(laughter)

00:34:05.186 --> 00:34:10.254
MATT: Okay. He looks down at you and says, "Not
bad. Going with the odds.

00:34:10.254 --> 00:34:11.713
"It's three to one against him."

00:34:11.713 --> 00:34:15.552
SAM: All right, yes. Just don't mention if I win.
Maybe I'll come and collect later.

00:34:15.552 --> 00:34:16.772
ORION: I have 600 gold pieces--

00:34:16.772 --> 00:34:17.836
MATT: You don't hear this.

00:34:17.836 --> 00:34:20.177
SAM: I'll collect later. Don't say anything.

00:34:20.177 --> 00:34:22.394
MATT: "All right."

00:34:22.394 --> 00:34:29.809
TALIESIN: Good chap, I'd like to place a bet. 500
gold pieces on Philip.

00:34:29.809 --> 00:34:34.441
MATT: "On to Philip. All right. (laughs) 500."

00:34:34.441 --> 00:34:40.408
ORION: I'm going to break my bank and follow suit
to my human friend. 612 is, I think,

00:34:40.408 --> 00:34:41.527
all I have left.

00:34:41.527 --> 00:34:49.982
MATT: "Curious number, but certainly." At this
time, the crowd gets a little more hushed, people

00:34:49.982 --> 00:34:54.903
are like, "Oh." And you see-- you don't see this,
because you're down in the Crucible-- you see the

00:34:54.903 --> 00:35:00.360
crowd, which has probably gathered close to 70
plus people, part, and you see walking over, soot

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.863
smeared across the front of his face, stepping up
is Kern the Hammer, with a bristled, half-orc

00:35:04.863 --> 00:35:09.585
mustache, a little bit tousled from a day of hard
work, sweat glistening off the top of his brow and

00:35:09.585 --> 00:35:10.987
the top of his head.

00:35:10.987 --> 00:35:13.117
TRAVIS: He's missing a lip.

00:35:13.117 --> 00:35:19.873
MATT: As he approaches, you can see-- there has
been some healing through the quick work of the

00:35:19.873 --> 00:35:24.576
clerics who worked after the last battle. However,
there is definitely a section of his upper lip

00:35:24.576 --> 00:35:29.121
that is permanently missing, looking almost like a
half-cleft palate. You can see beneath it, his

00:35:29.121 --> 00:35:33.257
sneering yellowed teeth grinding as he approaches
the Crucible.

00:35:33.257 --> 00:35:35.620
TALIESIN: I believe in you, Philip.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:37.840
LAURA: I'm going to bet.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.123
MATT: You're going to bet?

00:35:39.123 --> 00:35:41.896
LAURA: I'm going to bet. I'm going to put 600 on
Philip!

00:35:41.896 --> 00:35:44.828
MARISHA: So wait, this betting thing is
enjoyable?

00:35:44.828 --> 00:35:47.009
ORION: No, it's not. It's a gamble.

00:35:47.009 --> 00:35:48.482
MARISHA: It feels bad?

00:35:48.482 --> 00:35:50.740
TALIESIN: It's terrible.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.108
MARISHA: So why do we do it?

00:35:52.108 --> 00:35:55.520
ORION: So we can make more, and plus, it's giving
faith in our friend.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.916
LAURA: It's inspiration.

00:35:59.077 --> 00:36:01.811
MARISHA: I'll bet five gold on Philip.

00:36:01.811 --> 00:36:07.641
TRAVIS: (laughs) That's an excellent bet. That is
an excellent bet, Keyleth.

00:36:07.641 --> 00:36:10.472
MARISHA: Thank you! Is that how it works?

00:36:10.472 --> 00:36:16.163
MATT: Vax stands behind you and is like, "Yes,
I'll stand behind your bet," and keeps his gold to

00:36:16.163 --> 00:36:22.407
himself. At this point, the crowd separates. This
tension's mounting, and everyone's eyes are on

00:36:22.407 --> 00:36:27.065
Kern as he steps up to the edge of the Crucible.
You now notice the dark figure. The noonday sun is

00:36:27.065 --> 00:36:31.265
now high in the sky, and you can see, by the
little bit of the shadowed outline of Kern,

00:36:31.265 --> 00:36:37.330
muscle-bound, looming over the edge of the
Crucible. You hear a voice call down to you, low

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:44.725
and gravelly and familiar. "You! Did you like the
gift I sent you?"

00:36:44.725 --> 00:36:51.382
TRAVIS: I reach into my belt and I pull out his
upper lip, and I give it a smell and I say, I've

00:36:51.382 --> 00:36:55.631
enjoyed it very much. I've come to collect the
rest. And I fling it into the pit.

00:36:55.631 --> 00:37:04.330
MATT: It hits the ground. "You're not wearing the
medal. A shame, really. I thought you'd be more

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:11.648
"proud of your status." (whoosh, thud). He leaps
down into the pit right before you, this grin on

00:37:11.648 --> 00:37:17.636
his face. As everyone's gathering around, people
are now swarming the bookie, handing gold left and

00:37:17.636 --> 00:37:22.231
right, and he's making notes in his little ledger
out of his pocket. People are beginning to gather

00:37:22.231 --> 00:37:25.347
around and crush against the outsides of the
Crucible with some people being careful, almost

00:37:25.347 --> 00:37:30.660
being pushed in. At this point in time, now,
Kern's glaring at you and you guys are slowly

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:41.861
circling each other. (grunts) "You've been
training, I see. Good. So have I!" He goes and

00:37:41.861 --> 00:37:43.675
takes his wine skin, pops off the top--

00:37:43.675 --> 00:37:52.158
TRAVIS: Hold! Surely a man of your stature would
honor me by sharing a drink before this battle.

00:37:52.158 --> 00:38:03.024
MATT: He takes (glugging) and throws you the
wineskin.

00:38:03.024 --> 00:38:05.730
TRAVIS: How much is left in there?

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:13.298
MATT: About a third. You're clutching it in your
hand, and he's staring at you intently.

00:38:13.298 --> 00:38:20.794
TRAVIS: (sniff, sniff) I don't drink such piss
water. I pour it out. I take out my own wineskin

00:38:20.794 --> 00:38:25.367
that I filled with the stone giant strength, and I
chug it down.

00:38:25.367 --> 00:38:27.022
SAM: He's juicing!

00:38:27.022 --> 00:38:30.165
MARISHA: Oh shit!

00:38:30.165 --> 00:38:31.573
TALIESIN: Oh!

00:38:31.573 --> 00:38:36.580
MATT: You see him snarl to the side as you toss
his wineskin to the ground and you chug your own.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:41.115
It tastes very heavily-- this is frost giant
strength, you said?

00:38:41.115 --> 00:38:42.946
TRAVIS: Or the stone giant, yeah.

00:38:42.946 --> 00:38:50.044
MATT: Oh, the stone giant. It tastes very heavily
of black charcoal, dust, grit, and the actual

00:38:50.044 --> 00:38:54.150
liquid itself has a very gravelly texture as it
goes down your throat, and you can feel chunks

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:58.052
getting caught, but you push through and continue
gulping it. It's thicker, like a molasses, than it

00:38:58.052 --> 00:39:02.799
is an actual liquid. You finish it off, toss it to
the side. Go ahead and mark your increase to

00:39:02.799 --> 00:39:03.924
strength for this.

00:39:03.924 --> 00:39:05.172
TRAVIS: I got it down already.

00:39:05.172 --> 00:39:08.547
(laughter)

00:39:08.547 --> 00:39:09.885
MATT: You came prepared!

00:39:09.885 --> 00:39:15.092
TRAVIS: (singing) We're going to need a montage, a
montage.

00:39:15.092 --> 00:39:20.530
MATT: (laughs) You toss your wineskin to the side.
The bookie, you hear now, raises his hand. "All

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:31.689
"here in attendance. We have here in the Crucible
this day, a rematch of titans. The standing

00:39:31.689 --> 00:39:41.963
"champion of all the Braving Grounds of Vasselheim:
Kern the Hammer." (cheers)

00:39:41.963 --> 00:39:45.215
(booing)

00:39:45.215 --> 00:39:49.952
MATT: Coins start raining on you: copper, silver,
and gold pieces spin down on the ground around

00:39:49.952 --> 00:39:57.279
you, Grog. You guys just stand tensely locked in
that warrior glare. "Challenging him, once again,

00:39:57.279 --> 00:40:07.448
"tail between his legs, intent on claiming his
glory, returning to the Crucible, Philip."

00:40:07.448 --> 00:40:17.137
TRAVIS: No! Philip is dead. There is no Philip.
There is only Grog, the Vengeful.

00:40:17.137 --> 00:40:20.511
(cheering)

00:40:20.511 --> 00:40:25.591
MATT: Cheers go up around the outside of the
Crucible. You can now see the entire crowd-- the

00:40:25.591 --> 00:40:31.255
energy itself is electric in the air; eyes are
intense and bloodshot. Everyone is looking down

00:40:31.255 --> 00:40:36.443
into what is about to be, hopefully, a drag-out,
throwdown fight. You feel the rippling strength of

00:40:36.443 --> 00:40:43.584
your stone giant elders tearing through your body.
You flex, and you hear with each muscle tensing

00:40:43.584 --> 00:40:47.746
and the popping of bones and sinew as you prepare
yourself for this. As you're doing this, you see

00:40:47.746 --> 00:40:54.904
across the way, Kern cracks his knuckles, and you
can see the giant scar from his snarling lip. You

00:40:54.904 --> 00:40:59.367
realize he hasn't been snarling this whole time;
it's just the natural state of his current smile.

00:40:59.367 --> 00:41:07.240
And then he snarls. You can see his orcish tusks
protruding out, and the gums themselves, black and

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.439
purple, peering out from underneath his upper lip
that you once destroyed.

00:41:10.439 --> 00:41:14.580
"I'm going to take yours this time, boy."

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:19.542
TRAVIS: Enough words, toothless. Let's do this.

00:41:19.542 --> 00:41:21.169
MATT: Roll initiative.

00:41:21.169 --> 00:41:28.745
TRAVIS: Oh, I get advantage, don't I? That's
better. 20.

00:41:28.745 --> 00:41:31.558
MARISHA: Music change!

00:41:31.558 --> 00:41:34.993
SAM: How did you have that ready?

00:41:34.993 --> 00:41:40.197
TALIESIN: Witchcraft!

00:41:40.197 --> 00:41:47.639
MATT: I keep all my stuff at the ready, just in
case. All right.

00:41:47.639 --> 00:41:49.416
TALIESIN: Are we that predictable?

00:41:49.416 --> 00:41:55.715
MATT: I have a whole cluster over here. So what'd
you get for initiative, in total?

00:41:55.715 --> 00:41:56.847
TRAVIS: 20.

00:41:56.847 --> 00:42:02.608
MARISHA: There's papers just littering our
apartment, just information.

00:42:02.608 --> 00:42:05.472
MATT: I have clusters and clusters of maps that
are either used or unused, at all times.

00:42:05.472 --> 00:42:08.045
All righty.

00:42:08.045 --> 00:42:09.914
MARISHA: Our house is a D&amp;amp;D cave.

00:42:09.914 --> 00:42:16.400
MATT: I'm so sorry. As you're preparing for this
circumstance, you are up first.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.368
Grog, you have initiative.

00:42:18.368 --> 00:42:24.276
TRAVIS: I race towards Kern, and I duck down as if
I'm going to go into a form tackle towards his

00:42:24.276 --> 00:42:30.950
waist. I take a step to the side at the last
second and wrap my arms around his waist from

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:34.508
behind, pick him up to DDT him over my shoulder.

00:42:34.508 --> 00:42:37.402
(cheering)

00:42:37.402 --> 00:42:38.910
ORION: The DDT!

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:40.009
MARISHA: The DDT!

00:42:40.009 --> 00:42:42.841
MATT: Okay. For this, go ahead and make an
athletics check.

00:42:42.841 --> 00:42:48.455
TRAVIS: Okay. (laughs) 25.

00:42:48.455 --> 00:42:49.578
MATT: 25.

00:42:49.578 --> 00:42:51.060
TRAVIS: 18 plus seven.

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:58.449
MATT: He rolled a 23. 15 plus eight. So you rush
up behind and he goes in for the feint, attempts

00:42:58.449 --> 00:43:02.698
to parry. However, you vanish from the side. He
feels the arms wrap around him and he reaches down

00:43:02.698 --> 00:43:06.365
instinctively to try and pry them away, but it's
too late as you lift him up off of his back and

00:43:06.365 --> 00:43:13.242
(whack) send him onto the ground. Go ahead and
roll 1d2 plus your strength modifier.

00:43:13.242 --> 00:43:15.634
LAURA: 1d-what? Two?

00:43:15.634 --> 00:43:17.200
MATT: Well, it's 1d4 divided by two.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.130
TRAVIS: Six.

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:25.202
MATT: Six, all right. (impact noise) So he took
the damage. There's no attacks this round,

00:43:25.202 --> 00:43:33.965
currently; however, he is currently prone. He is
prone on the ground right there. As you slam him

00:43:33.965 --> 00:43:37.636
onto the ground and release him, he falls to the
ground and you hear (pained grunt) this exhale of

00:43:37.636 --> 00:43:40.764
pain. All right, you also have a bonus action,
still.

00:43:40.764 --> 00:43:48.908
TRAVIS: Right, with that action, I would like to
go into-- does it take an action to rage?

00:43:48.908 --> 00:43:51.056
MATT: It takes a bonus action for you to rage.

00:43:51.056 --> 00:43:52.160
TRAVIS: Which is what this is?

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.136
MATT: Yes.

00:43:53.136 --> 00:43:54.451
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

00:43:54.451 --> 00:43:56.363
(cheering)

00:43:56.363 --> 00:44:00.371
MATT: And with that, as you see his form crumple
on the ground, he gets up to one knee and begins

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:06.262
standing up, wiping off a little bit of the dust
that's been smeared across his slobbered chin. You

00:44:06.262 --> 00:44:11.167
look down at him, and the light that's pouring
down from the sun that was once white and yellow

00:44:11.167 --> 00:44:18.059
in tone now turns to red as your eyes focus on
your quarry before you. That ends your turn.

00:44:18.059 --> 00:44:29.149
Kern uses half movement to stand up. (grunts)
Looks at you and gives this chuckle. (slow

00:44:29.149 --> 00:44:34.582
chuckle) "This early, then? So be it." Bites the
edge of his wrist and tears a chunk of his own

00:44:34.582 --> 00:44:41.913
flesh off the side of his arm. (tearing sound,
heavy breathing) Uses his bonus action to rage.

00:44:41.913 --> 00:44:47.844
Goes into his frenzied rage, as well. And he's
coming at you with both fists. One thing you

00:44:47.844 --> 00:44:52.229
notice, strangely: Kern, who previously seemed to
throw haymakers at you, before,

00:44:52.229 --> 00:44:54.398
goes into a stance.

00:44:54.398 --> 00:44:57.579
LAURA: He's been training!

00:44:57.579 --> 00:44:59.066
ORION: He monked up!

00:44:59.066 --> 00:45:09.061
MATT: And goes into swing two heavy fists at you.
That is going to be a-- Let's see, 24?

00:45:09.061 --> 00:45:10.205
TRAVIS: That hits.

00:45:10.205 --> 00:45:13.315
MATT: Ooh, that is going to be a 27.

00:45:13.315 --> 00:45:14.409
TRAVIS: Yeah, that'll hit, too.

00:45:14.409 --> 00:45:18.302
MATT: All right, first hit is nine points of
damage.

00:45:18.356 --> 00:45:19.308
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:45:19.308 --> 00:45:21.004
MATT: Second one is eight points of damage.

00:45:21.004 --> 00:45:22.819
TRAVIS: He got nine points of damage?

00:45:22.819 --> 00:45:25.913
MATT: (whack, whack) Yeah. And for those who are
paying attention: they're both raging, they both

00:45:25.913 --> 00:45:29.608
take half damage, but since they're both doing it,
we're negating both abilities because otherwise

00:45:29.608 --> 00:45:31.072
this battle would take three hours.

00:45:31.072 --> 00:45:35.659
(whack, whack) These fists, you see as they hit
you, they're not just extremely strong and

00:45:35.659 --> 00:45:40.069
powerful previously, but they're hitting precise
areas where you feel the muscle and bone is less

00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:42.998
resistant. There is technique to these punches
that wasn't there before.

00:45:42.998 --> 00:45:45.296
TRAVIS: No problem!

00:45:45.296 --> 00:45:54.033
MATT: He is going to dodge to the side here.
(whoosh) Dodge off to the side (whoosh). Prepares

00:45:54.033 --> 00:45:56.308
himself, fists ready, for a defensive action.
It's your go.

00:45:56.308 --> 00:46:02.946
TRAVIS: All right, I would like to enter a
frenzied rage, and I would like to-- since he

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.889
moves off to my side, I see him move, and I throw
a back fist into the concave area of his nose.

00:46:09.889 --> 00:46:11.066
MATT: Okay.

00:46:11.066 --> 00:46:13.822
TRAVIS: 23.

00:46:13.822 --> 00:46:14.872
MATT: 23 hits.

00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:19.239
TRAVIS: Great. That is-- motherfucker, six.

00:46:19.239 --> 00:46:20.655
MATT: Six damage?

00:46:20.655 --> 00:46:21.392
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:46:21.392 --> 00:46:22.313
MATT: All righty.

00:46:22.313 --> 00:46:27.929
TRAVIS: I would like to then reach forward, as
he's reeling back from that hit, with both of my

00:46:27.929 --> 00:46:30.415
thumbs and throw them towards his eyes.

00:46:30.415 --> 00:46:38.709
MATT: You're going to attempt to blind? All right,
so what this is going to be is for your second

00:46:38.709 --> 00:46:44.465
attack, a loose grapple, and we'll see if you can
manage to push forward from that point. So go

00:46:44.465 --> 00:46:46.627
ahead and make an athletics check.

00:46:46.627 --> 00:46:49.273
TRAVIS: 14.

00:46:49.273 --> 00:46:54.210
MATT: 14. That is going to be a 16 on his end,
unfortunately. As you reach up, he (whoosh) slaps

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:59.039
the hands away. His defensive posture-- he was
ready for that sort of advance and he just knocks

00:46:59.039 --> 00:47:03.522
them to the side with a grin. Yeah. You do still
have a bonus action, if you wish to use it.

00:47:03.522 --> 00:47:07.651
TRAVIS: If he knocks it aside, I take my right leg
and I throw it to the outside of his kneecap,

00:47:07.651 --> 00:47:09.818
trying to snap his ACL or MCL.

00:47:09.818 --> 00:47:11.479
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for the attack on
that.

00:47:11.479 --> 00:47:13.663
TRAVIS: That's a 27.

00:47:13.663 --> 00:47:15.180
MATT: 27 does indeed hit.

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:20.233
TRAVIS: Why didn't that happen before? That's
seven.

00:47:20.233 --> 00:47:29.931
MATT: Seven points of damage? Oof, all right. As
he pushes your hands out of the way, (whack) a

00:47:29.931 --> 00:47:35.336
resounding snap sound as your foot hits the side
of his thigh. His leg muscles themselves are like

00:47:35.336 --> 00:47:39.314
a tree trunk and take most of the impact of the
damage and you see him (pained cry). You can see

00:47:39.314 --> 00:47:45.316
the pain in his face. His grin gives way to a
sudden grimace of pain. Your leg is now held in

00:47:45.316 --> 00:47:50.097
place; he resisted the full force of the blow to
some physical damage himself, but not enough to

00:47:50.097 --> 00:47:53.538
knock the knee out. Do you want to move at all, or
are you going to stay where you are?

00:47:53.538 --> 00:47:56.898
TRAVIS: I would like to move to flank his right
side.

00:47:56.898 --> 00:47:58.159
MATT: All righty.

00:47:58.159 --> 00:48:00.128
SAM: Put him in a body bag!

00:48:00.128 --> 00:48:04.577
MATT: As you move over, with that it comes to his
turn. As you're moving to the side, he spins

00:48:04.577 --> 00:48:09.736
around this time. You have not yet seen him move
his legs to this extent, to a full back roundhouse

00:48:09.736 --> 00:48:14.374
kick towards your head. That is going to be a 20?

00:48:14.374 --> 00:48:15.697
TRAVIS: That hits.

00:48:15.697 --> 00:48:19.303
MATT: That hits, okay. Second attack is going to
be a 19?

00:48:19.303 --> 00:48:20.445
TRAVIS: That hits.

00:48:20.445 --> 00:48:24.298
MATT: Next attack is going to be a 12, no, 13.

00:48:24.298 --> 00:48:25.406
TRAVIS: That misses.

00:48:25.406 --> 00:48:30.305
MATT: Okay. So the roundhouse kick (whoosh) swings
around, completely unexpected as you pull to the

00:48:30.305 --> 00:48:37.058
side. (smack) Hits you right square in the side of
the face and jaw. That is going to be seven points

00:48:37.058 --> 00:48:38.115
of damage.

00:48:38.115 --> 00:48:39.120
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:43.603
MATT: And as you're reeling from that, he brings
the leg back, jumps in the air and does a

00:48:43.603 --> 00:48:49.349
secondary jump, side-swiping kick to the other
side of your head, as you're sent to the side.

00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:54.299
(whack, whack) Second one doing eight points of
damage. (whack, whack)

00:48:54.299 --> 00:48:57.734
TRAVIS: Okay. All right.

00:48:57.734 --> 00:49:05.623
MATT: And he's going to move slightly over here,
basically getting you up against the wall. He's

00:49:05.623 --> 00:49:09.607
situating himself now where since you moved to the
side; he's putting you in this pincer formation

00:49:09.607 --> 00:49:12.534
between the wall and himself. That ends his turn.
You're up.

00:49:12.534 --> 00:49:19.612
TRAVIS: (grunts, pants) I see you've been taking
some ballet. How very cultured of you. And I rush

00:49:19.612 --> 00:49:21.992
forward. I'm between him and the wall?

00:49:21.992 --> 00:49:24.066
MATT: You are between him and the wall, yes.

00:49:24.066 --> 00:49:26.214
TRAVIS: Okay. (laughs)

00:49:26.214 --> 00:49:31.129
LAURA: I get up on Trinket's shoulders and cheer.

00:49:31.129 --> 00:49:36.381
MATT: (roars) Trinket roars with you. (roar) This
roar of victory, which people around immediately

00:49:36.381 --> 00:49:40.842
take two steps away from the large bear that's
suddenly roaring in the center. You guys are

00:49:40.842 --> 00:49:42.318
unfazed, too focused on each other.

00:49:42.318 --> 00:49:47.989
TRAVIS: I rush up and get him, give him a little
nasty-- of the last time for a double thunderclap,

00:49:47.989 --> 00:49:49.550
to either side of his ears.

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:51.006
MATT: Oof, okay.

00:49:51.006 --> 00:49:56.650
TRAVIS: That is a 13.

00:49:56.650 --> 00:50:00.971
MATT: 13. Unfortunately, as you go to swing, he
(whoosh) ducks out of the way, and your hands slap

00:50:00.971 --> 00:50:03.401
into each other, finding no purchase on his head.

00:50:03.401 --> 00:50:07.054
TRAVIS: That's all right. Since I didn't find any
purchase, I'll see where his ears are, try and

00:50:07.054 --> 00:50:13.209
grab them, and I'm going to attempt to rip his
ears off of his head. His nice pointy ears.

00:50:13.209 --> 00:50:17.159
MATT: Okay, so your second attack is going to be
to try and grab his ears. Go for it.

00:50:17.159 --> 00:50:19.596
TRAVIS: 16.

00:50:19.596 --> 00:50:24.537
MATT: 16, no. As you go up for the one ear, he
parries it to the side with his hand.

00:50:24.537 --> 00:50:30.042
TRAVIS: (sighs) Third attack. 14.

00:50:30.042 --> 00:50:37.513
MATT: 14. (whoosh) Knocks that one out of the way.
As you're (whoosh, whoosh) swinging at him, he

00:50:37.513 --> 00:50:40.718
seems to just be dodging out of the way. He still
has the force behind him, but whatever he's picked

00:50:40.758 --> 00:50:43.840
up now has completely thrown you off. You weren't
prepared. You were prepared for a bruiser. You've

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:47.486
now seen, still a bruiser, but with a little more
refined technique, and it's throwing you off your

00:50:47.486 --> 00:50:51.822
game. You need to resettle yourself. You need to
pull yourself in, Grog. However, in that moment of

00:50:51.822 --> 00:51:02.250
thinking, he swings at you with a double pummel up
towards the torso. That is a natural 20. That is

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:03.556
going to be a 13.

00:51:03.556 --> 00:51:04.910
SAM: Oh! Miss.

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:11.194
MATT: This is yours, I believe. And that's going
to be a nine. (laughs) Or, sorry, a ten. So first

00:51:11.194 --> 00:51:15.256
one hits, second two miss. (whack) The first one
comes through and smacks you right in the center

00:51:15.256 --> 00:51:20.179
of the stomach. With a double hit, that's 14
points of damage.

00:51:20.179 --> 00:51:22.797
TRAVIS: I would like to use my Stone's Endurance.

00:51:22.797 --> 00:51:29.073
MATT: Go for it. You, at that point as the punch
hits your stomach, you flex, feeling the strength

00:51:29.073 --> 00:51:33.481
of the mountain fill your body, your ancestral
roots of your stone giant

00:51:33.481 --> 00:51:35.120
brethren fill your form.

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:38.146
TRAVIS: That's 16.

00:51:38.146 --> 00:51:44.562
MATT: 16. As the fist (crash) finds the side of
your stomach, the iron-like form that is your

00:51:44.562 --> 00:51:49.378
torso stops his fist in its place, and you see
him (pained exhale) pull away, shaking his hand.

00:51:49.422 --> 00:51:54.236
As he shakes away, he brings up his other hand to
backhand you. You duck out of the way. He swings

00:51:54.236 --> 00:51:59.624
with a kick around with the momentum, and you
catch it in the middle of the air. So we're going

00:51:59.624 --> 00:52:02.440
to start your turn with you now holding his leg up
by the side of your head.

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:08.196
TRAVIS: Oh, fantastic. I'll keep that leg up in
the air. I'll move it over to my shoulder, take

00:52:08.196 --> 00:52:12.539
both my hands up and bring it down on top of his
kneecap, hyper-flexing the leg.

00:52:12.539 --> 00:52:14.171
(yelling)

00:52:14.171 --> 00:52:16.021
MATT: Go ahead and roll for attack on this.

00:52:16.021 --> 00:52:17.611
TRAVIS: That's better. 26.

00:52:17.611 --> 00:52:20.073
(cheering)

00:52:20.073 --> 00:52:23.777
TRAVIS: That's eight.

00:52:23.777 --> 00:52:25.395
MATT: Eight damage? All right.

00:52:25.395 --> 00:52:27.417
MARISHA: Maybe we can start a chant for
inspiration.

00:52:27.417 --> 00:52:29.248
LAURA: Yeah, can we? Grog.

00:52:29.248 --> 00:52:30.993
MATT: So that's your first attack?

00:52:30.993 --> 00:52:32.206
TRAVIS: That was my first.

00:52:32.206 --> 00:52:36.331
MATT: So as you go (crash), bring it down, the
knee-- a human's leg would have hyperextended, but

00:52:36.331 --> 00:52:41.229
the sheer size of muscle-- and this is comparable
to your own-- you feel it definitely hurt and he's

00:52:41.229 --> 00:52:44.930
like (pained cry) yelp out in pain, but it's not
enough to fully pop the leg back.

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:48.396
TRAVIS: What's the matter, ballerina? I thought
you should be stretched out and ready for this.

00:52:48.396 --> 00:52:51.383
And I reach back and I drive my fist into his
nutsack.

00:52:51.383 --> 00:52:53.158
(laughter)

00:52:53.158 --> 00:52:55.234
MATT: Roll a second attack.

00:52:55.234 --> 00:52:56.240
TRAVIS: 25.

00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:58.472
MATT: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll
damage on that.

00:52:58.472 --> 00:53:00.637
ORION: Oh my god, a Grog punch to the balls.

00:53:00.637 --> 00:53:02.106
TRAVIS: Eight. My first eight.

00:53:02.106 --> 00:53:04.796
MATT: Nice! Second eight, actually. You've already
rolled.

00:53:04.796 --> 00:53:05.979
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right, okay.

00:53:05.979 --> 00:53:09.398
ORION: I'm going to argue that that should be
doubled because there's two balls.

00:53:09.398 --> 00:53:11.343
(laughter)

00:53:11.343 --> 00:53:16.865
MATT: Kern is one of those individuals who's had
his nuts kicked enough times in his life to know

00:53:16.865 --> 00:53:21.511
the pain well and be prepared for it. So as you
come down, (whack) slam it right into him. You

00:53:21.511 --> 00:53:28.236
hear this (high, pained wail) almost wolf-like
screeching howl as Kern's head lifts up in severe

00:53:28.236 --> 00:53:33.282
pain. His hands come down and grasp your wrist and
is now holding it, trying to pull it away from his

00:53:33.282 --> 00:53:35.722
midsection. He's in a very bad situation right
now.

00:53:35.722 --> 00:53:41.238
TRAVIS: With that last one, can I take my right
leg and in an effort to shoot for that same knee

00:53:41.238 --> 00:53:43.766
I've been kicking at, aim for the knee or sweep
his feet?

00:53:43.766 --> 00:53:45.179
MATT: Sure, go for it.

00:53:45.179 --> 00:53:48.493
TRAVIS: Fuck. That'll miss. It's a 13.

00:53:48.493 --> 00:53:53.253
MATT: 13. As you pull back to sweep, Kern uses
this advantage to bring up the other leg that you

00:53:53.253 --> 00:53:58.627
haven't hit, plant it right on your shoulder and
neck area, and then push off your body. As you

00:53:58.627 --> 00:54:02.970
sweep underneath, he leaps backward, flipping in
the air. (thud) Lands on both of his feet,

00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:06.814
clutching the inside of his groin area, like
(snarling grunt) shaking off the pain through the

00:54:06.814 --> 00:54:10.402
anger. So he leaps back to here.

00:54:10.402 --> 00:54:13.188
MARISHA: As that's happening, we all start a
chant.

00:54:13.188 --> 00:54:18.157
ALL: (chanting) Grog, Grog, Grog.

00:54:18.157 --> 00:54:24.994
SAM: As they're chanting, I'm starting to sing
amid the chant. (singing) It's the eye of the

00:54:24.994 --> 00:54:34.036
goliath, it's the thrill of the fight. Rising up
to the challenge of that asshole. (speaking) And

00:54:34.036 --> 00:54:36.451
I'm trying to send inspiration to him.

00:54:36.451 --> 00:54:41.295
MATT: With that, you hear through the fury,
through the anger that the chant, your real name,

00:54:41.295 --> 00:54:46.664
not Philip now, your real name, reclaimed in the
center of this proving point in the center of the

00:54:46.664 --> 00:54:52.789
oldest known city to civilization, under the
visual guidance of the god of strength and valor.

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:59.592
And through all that, you hear the gentle hymn of
Scanlan's voice cut through all that and come to

00:54:59.592 --> 00:55:04.648
you with a beat, a rhythmic beat that drives you
forward. Go ahead and take a d10 inspiration.

00:55:04.648 --> 00:55:06.417
(cheering)

00:55:06.417 --> 00:55:15.294
MATT: Now Kern, having landed on his feet, rushes
forward towards you, and first using his bonus

00:55:15.294 --> 00:55:19.223
action, is going to go ahead and reach down for a
very deep uppercut. It looks like he's coming in

00:55:19.223 --> 00:55:24.639
for a left, and sweeps down to try and take you from
underneath, breaking through your defense. That is going

00:55:24.639 --> 00:55:25.641
to be a 20.

00:55:25.641 --> 00:55:26.795
TRAVIS: That hits.

00:55:26.795 --> 00:55:33.658
MATT: You take ten points of damage. Right to the
chin from underneath. For the bonus action, Kern

00:55:33.788 --> 00:55:38.992
then comes back, and you're used to an unleashed
flurry. Kern, however, comes back into a fully

00:55:38.992 --> 00:55:43.784
defensive position, righting his hands and leg in
a backwards stance, and is just looking at you,

00:55:43.784 --> 00:55:48.176
ready for you to come. He's using his action to go
into a dodge. It's now your turn.

00:55:48.176 --> 00:55:50.511
SAM: Oh, wait, so he gets some sort of advantage?

00:55:50.511 --> 00:55:52.843
MATT: All attacks against him have disadvantage
this next turn.

00:55:52.843 --> 00:56:00.036
ORION: Wait, against him? No, he meant...
advantage, because balls.

00:56:00.036 --> 00:56:00.959
MATT: Nope.

00:56:00.959 --> 00:56:02.005
ORION: Damn it.

00:56:02.005 --> 00:56:03.561
MARISHA: The balls doesn't give advantage?

00:56:03.561 --> 00:56:04.894
ORION: No, he has tough nuts. Never mind.

00:56:04.894 --> 00:56:09.760
MATT: He has the feat Toughness, which I think
really resists any sort of

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.033
ball damage at this point.

00:56:11.033 --> 00:56:20.303
TRAVIS: In an effort to keep my distance, I run
towards him, I jump up in the air and throw one

00:56:20.303 --> 00:56:23.877
thrust-kick towards the side, right towards his
chest, just to see what his defense will do.

00:56:23.919 --> 00:56:27.616
MATT: Go for it. With disadvantage, so roll
twice.

00:56:27.616 --> 00:56:33.001
LAURA: Oh god. Mother bitch!

00:56:33.001 --> 00:56:36.207
TRAVIS: Well, that was a natural 20, but 19.

00:56:36.207 --> 00:56:37.972
MATT: 19. Total 19?

00:56:37.972 --> 00:56:38.965
TRAVIS: Total 19.

00:56:38.965 --> 00:56:40.463
MATT: That just barely hits.

00:56:40.463 --> 00:56:49.946
TRAVIS: Can I add the inspiration to the-- no,
just to the roll, right. That is an eight.

00:56:49.946 --> 00:56:51.848
MATT: Eight. So.

00:56:51.848 --> 00:56:55.426
TRAVIS: Halved. So half of three is one and a
half, and we're rounding up?

00:56:55.426 --> 00:56:57.826
MATT: Rounding up, yeah. Three and four is a two,
considered.

00:56:57.826 --> 00:56:59.059
TRAVIS: Right, so eight.

00:56:59.059 --> 00:57:04.671
MATT: All righty. All right. So you rush up,
(whack) slamming. He puts the defense out and

00:57:04.671 --> 00:57:08.810
tries to push to the side. However, his defense is
imperfect; you can see he's still new to this

00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:14.120
fighting style, and you still manage to push
through with sheer force and slam into the side of

00:57:14.173 --> 00:57:15.996
his torso from the impact.

00:57:15.996 --> 00:57:19.751
TRAVIS: I leap forward again and try to throw my
thumbs into his eyes.

00:57:19.751 --> 00:57:24.014
MATT: Okay, you're going for the blind again. Go
ahead and roll an attack on this, with

00:57:24.014 --> 00:57:25.015
disadvantage.

00:57:25.015 --> 00:57:27.972
TRAVIS: 21-- aw. 15.

00:57:27.972 --> 00:57:28.826
MATT: 15.

00:57:28.826 --> 00:57:30.360
ORION: Inspiration!

00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:32.943
SAM: If you want to use it.

00:57:32.943 --> 00:57:35.376
TRAVIS: That's a 22.

00:57:35.376 --> 00:57:36.293
MATT: 22 hits.

00:57:36.293 --> 00:57:37.752
(cheering)

00:57:37.752 --> 00:57:44.365
MATT: So you rush forward to grab. You have hold
of his head now. There's no damage this round, but

00:57:44.365 --> 00:57:49.159
you're enabling yourself now for the rest of the
round to attempt to push into his eyes. There's no

00:57:49.159 --> 00:57:53.220
damage on this one. You grab the side of his head,
and you see his eyes open with this look of fear

00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:58.111
at the unexpected ferocity from you. Go ahead and
make an athletics check.

00:57:58.111 --> 00:57:59.791
MARISHA: Come on, Grog!

00:57:59.791 --> 00:58:02.128
TRAVIS: 24.

00:58:02.128 --> 00:58:07.588
MATT: 24. He rolled a 19, so go ahead and do
damage on this. Roll damage.

00:58:07.588 --> 00:58:15.283
TRAVIS: With the four? Six.

00:58:15.283 --> 00:58:21.371
MATT: Six, all righty. So as you have a hold of
his head, you grin as your thumbs push into his

00:58:21.371 --> 00:58:29.345
eyes. He yells out in pain, and before you can
damage the eyes permanently, he slaps off of your

00:58:29.345 --> 00:58:34.348
hands so hard and with such an intense push that
you can't help but feel your actual forearms be

00:58:34.348 --> 00:58:38.947
blown back. However, he's clutching the side of
his face, and for the next round, he is blinded.

00:58:38.947 --> 00:58:41.789
TRAVIS: Can I move?

00:58:41.789 --> 00:58:43.040
MATT: You can move, as well.

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.402
TRAVIS: I just back straight up.

00:58:44.402 --> 00:58:49.005
MATT: Back this way? He currently doesn't threaten
you because he's blinded, so you can rush past him

00:58:49.005 --> 00:58:50.599
and not get an attack of opportunity.

00:58:50.599 --> 00:58:51.445
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

00:58:51.445 --> 00:58:52.250
MATT: Yeah.

00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:54.386
TRAVIS: I'll move along the wall to his left
side.

00:58:54.386 --> 00:58:55.365
MATT: Over here?

00:58:55.365 --> 00:58:56.205
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:58:56.205 --> 00:58:57.165
MATT: To there?

00:58:57.165 --> 00:58:58.022
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:58:58.022 --> 00:58:58.767
MATT: Okay.

00:58:58.767 --> 00:58:59.800
LAURA: But back up?

00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:01.351
TRAVIS: And back up just a little bit. Yeah.

00:59:01.351 --> 00:59:12.428
MATT: Okay. So. As you dodge off to the side,
Kern's grabbing his face, and just takes a moment.

00:59:12.428 --> 00:59:19.194
Hears your footsteps along the side, as there is
no stealth to this; there are just footprints.

00:59:19.194 --> 00:59:24.526
However, Kern does attempt to sidestep over. He's
going to attempt to make three strikes at you,

00:59:24.526 --> 00:59:27.297
with a disadvantage on all of them because he's
currently blinded.

00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:30.668
TRAVIS: All right, you seem to be rolling pretty
high. You could use the dice that I threw.

00:59:30.668 --> 00:59:37.800
MATT: And rolls against him have advantage as
well. All right, so attacks against you. That is

00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.397
going to be a 14.

00:59:39.397 --> 00:59:40.729
TRAVIS: Misses!

00:59:40.729 --> 00:59:45.850
MATT: Natural 20 or an eight. So that'll be 16.

00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:47.132
TRAVIS: Okay, that misses.

00:59:47.132 --> 00:59:58.749
MATT: 19 and 19. Another one does hit. So, wide
punches forward. They're a foot away from you. You

00:59:58.749 --> 01:00:03.546
chuckle, getting out of the way, and as you
chuckle, he hears that. (snap) And for a moment,

01:00:03.546 --> 01:00:06.557
his mind clarifies, even though his eyes are
closed with a trickle of blood off the side of one

01:00:06.557 --> 01:00:11.875
of the eye. He immediately goes into a
faster-than-you-expected midsection punch that

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:15.946
(whack) smacks you right in the middle of your
laughing stomach. Because you're laughing, there

01:00:16.076 --> 01:00:20.854
is that tension, but it wasn't flexed, prepared
for an actual impact from a fist. And you take

01:00:20.854 --> 01:00:25.007
seven points of damage from the hit to your
abdomen.

01:00:25.007 --> 01:00:27.426
TRAVIS: All right.

01:00:27.426 --> 01:00:30.801
MATT: It is your turn. He is still blinded, so you
have advantage on all these attacks. As you reel

01:00:30.801 --> 01:00:32.177
from the hit to your midsection--

01:00:32.177 --> 01:00:37.569
TRAVIS: I want to move-- no, I'll stay right where
I am. Can I reach forward, grab his head and his

01:00:37.715 --> 01:00:40.027
shoulder, and go in for a bite attack at his
neck?

01:00:40.027 --> 01:00:41.257
MATT: You certainly can.

01:00:41.257 --> 01:00:46.727
TRAVIS: (growls) Yes! Aiming for the jugular. 23.

01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:50.137
MATT: 23? Definitely hits. Go ahead and roll
damage on that.

01:00:50.137 --> 01:00:53.322
TRAVIS: All right. Eight.

01:00:53.322 --> 01:00:54.967
SAM: You're sure you're adding that right?

01:00:54.967 --> 01:00:55.714
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:00:55.714 --> 01:00:56.880
SAM: It's just plus four?

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.934
TRAVIS: Plus six. This is halved.

01:00:58.934 --> 01:01:02.058
SAM: Are you sure? I thought you were both raging.
There's no halves!

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:03.268
TRAVIS: No, we halve the die.

01:01:03.268 --> 01:01:05.464
SAM: Is that true?

01:01:05.464 --> 01:01:10.346
MATT: Both of them are at half damage because of
their raging, so we're considering them both to

01:01:10.346 --> 01:01:11.268
not count that.

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:13.261
SAM: So they're not counting the halves?

01:01:13.261 --> 01:01:14.709
LAURA: So he shouldn't be halving his die?

01:01:14.709 --> 01:01:21.395
MATT: Well, no. The die halving is the natural
damage of a punch, 1d2. So it's half of a d4.

01:01:21.395 --> 01:01:22.887
LAURA: Got it. Sorry.

01:01:22.887 --> 01:01:28.042
MATT: Except for Kern, who is currently doing a
full d4 on his punches. For some reason! (laughs)

01:01:28.042 --> 01:01:39.356
All right. So. As you rush in, he puts out a hand
to try and punch instinctively as you rush towards

01:01:39.356 --> 01:01:44.347
him, his eyes still coated in his own blood. You
push to the side, reach in, and grab the back of

01:01:44.347 --> 01:01:48.539
his shoulder, and (crunching sound) Grog-bite into
the side. It's like biting into a tree trunk, his

01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:49.835
skin is so thick.

01:01:49.835 --> 01:01:51.531
TRAVIS: I eat bar stools for dinner.

01:01:51.531 --> 01:01:58.650
MATT: You do, actually, and the taste is similar,
Your teeth grind in, and you find yourself tearing

01:01:58.650 --> 01:02:02.716
into probably what would be the toughest steak
you've ever tried. You get about a quarter to a

01:02:02.753 --> 01:02:06.035
half an inch in with your teeth, definitely taking
a chunk and (tearing sound) tearing out what you

01:02:06.035 --> 01:02:12.132
can, but based on the general hardiness of his
half-orc structure, you don't get to a jugular or

01:02:12.132 --> 01:02:17.253
any major vein, but you do leave a gash that
leaves a significant mark on his body. That's the

01:02:17.253 --> 01:02:18.099
first attack.

01:02:18.099 --> 01:02:21.304
TRAVIS: I pull back from the bite, and I whisper
into his ear, I was wondering what was going to

01:02:21.356 --> 01:02:28.053
break first: your spirit, or your body. And I
would like to try to pick him up over my head and

01:02:28.053 --> 01:02:30.189
bring him down on my knee, Bane-style.

01:02:30.189 --> 01:02:31.563
LAURA: Batman!

01:02:31.563 --> 01:02:37.584
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check. With
advantage.

01:02:37.584 --> 01:02:40.939
TRAVIS: Okay, that's 25.

01:02:40.939 --> 01:02:42.115
MATT: 25.

01:02:42.115 --> 01:02:47.393
TRAVIS: Do I need to roll on advantage to see if I
get a 20?

01:02:47.523 --> 01:02:48.623
MATT: Sure, go for it.

01:02:48.623 --> 01:02:50.339
TRAVIS: Oh, it's a 19. It was so close! 26.

01:02:50.339 --> 01:02:51.504
MATT: 26.

01:02:51.504 --> 01:02:52.830
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch!

01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:57.932
MATT: You reach forward and scoop him up, lifting
him over your head. He's trying to resist it, but

01:02:57.932 --> 01:03:04.307
in his unable-to-see state, there's no way he can
possibly resist this. You lift him up over the

01:03:04.307 --> 01:03:12.088
top, (whack) down onto the knee. Go ahead and roll
damage. I will consider both your two final

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:14.966
attacks, but this attack damage is doubled,
modifier included.

01:03:14.966 --> 01:03:16.314
TRAVIS: Seven, so 14.

01:03:16.314 --> 01:03:18.616
(cheering)

01:03:18.616 --> 01:03:28.574
MATT: All right. As part of this, he is--

01:03:28.574 --> 01:03:30.279
SAM: Oh no. He's going to pull some shit.

01:03:30.279 --> 01:03:33.047
TRAVIS: Matt reaching for things is never good.

01:03:33.047 --> 01:03:36.669
MATT: I'm going to go ahead and make a
constitution check on his end. The DC is going to

01:03:36.669 --> 01:03:45.108
be the damage dealt, so he's going to try and
essentially resist the effect of this. He is at

01:03:45.108 --> 01:03:53.768
disadvantage because he's blinded. That is a
three. An 18 and a three. However, he still has a

01:03:53.768 --> 01:03:57.019
high constitution and so that's still plus 9 to
that.

01:03:57.019 --> 01:03:58.774
TALIESIN, TRAVIS, and LAURA: 12.

01:03:58.774 --> 01:04:05.136
MATT: Not enough to beat the 14. So, for the
purposes of this round, Kern is currently on the

01:04:05.136 --> 01:04:07.596
ground, stunned. He loses an entire round of
combat.

01:04:07.596 --> 01:04:09.623
(excited noises)

01:04:09.623 --> 01:04:19.322
MATT: No longer blinded, but Kern is currently
(choking noises) reaching towards his back, where

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:23.315
there's this shooting pain throughout his entire
nervous system. You have another round to go.

01:04:23.315 --> 01:04:31.034
TRAVIS: I reach up with my fingernails, and I
carve these scrapes down my face, and I leap up

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:33.492
with both feet, and I jump down on his head.

01:04:33.492 --> 01:04:35.338
(yelling)

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:37.686
LAURA: It's so brutal!

01:04:37.686 --> 01:04:40.604
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll. Attacks have
advantage on him because he's stunned.

01:04:40.604 --> 01:04:43.203
TRAVIS: That's better. 23.

01:04:43.203 --> 01:04:44.343
MATT: 23 hits.

01:04:44.343 --> 01:04:49.447
TRAVIS: You know what? Just three of them. (battle
cry)

01:04:49.447 --> 01:04:53.680
MATT: Just rage-stomping on him? Okay! Three
attacks.

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.255
TRAVIS: 20.

01:04:56.255 --> 01:04:57.485
MATT: 20 hits.

01:04:57.485 --> 01:05:00.036
MARISHA: You're right. This is so much more
exciting when you bet.

01:05:00.036 --> 01:05:01.143
TRAVIS: 15.

01:05:01.143 --> 01:05:09.212
MATT: The first, you leap up into the air, both
feet down (wham) right into the shoulder and side

01:05:09.212 --> 01:05:12.812
of the rib cage. You hear a (wet crunching noise)
snap as at least two ribs give way under the sheer

01:05:12.812 --> 01:05:18.761
weight and force of your left foot. As you leap up
again, bring down both feet a second time, one

01:05:18.761 --> 01:05:23.229
finds purchase on the ground next to him, while
the second one hits him right in the lower

01:05:23.229 --> 01:05:29.751
abdomen, pelvis region. (whack) With this second
one, you hear (deep groaning) the scream as the

01:05:29.751 --> 01:05:34.581
air is nearly knocked out of Kern. The third one,
you reach up, this time just seeing seething rage.

01:05:34.581 --> 01:05:38.342
You can feel the actual foam at the corners of
your mouth dripping down the sides of your chin.

01:05:38.342 --> 01:05:43.624
As you bring your leg up again to stomp a third
time, this time Kern rolls out of the way. He

01:05:43.624 --> 01:05:46.241
manages to just avoid the third slam. What's the
total damage on that?

01:05:46.241 --> 01:05:53.048
TRAVIS: Did I roll? It's good. Eight and eight!

01:05:53.048 --> 01:05:54.318
MATT: Damn!

01:05:54.318 --> 01:06:03.171
TALIESIN: You turned him into a stain.

01:06:03.171 --> 01:06:11.364
MATT: Kern, no longer stunned, now gets up,
(grunts) holding the back of his side.

01:06:11.364 --> 01:06:13.583
LAURA: You suck, Kern!

01:06:13.583 --> 01:06:15.503
ORION: You also smell!

01:06:15.503 --> 01:06:21.639
MATT: (chuckles) Glances up for a moment at you,
and sees you raising your fists and gives a grin.

01:06:21.639 --> 01:06:29.907
Looks back towards you and lunges towards you now.
He's going to attempt a grapple at you. Go ahead and

01:06:29.907 --> 01:06:32.364
make an athletics check.

01:06:32.364 --> 01:06:34.952
TRAVIS: That's a one.

01:06:34.952 --> 01:06:36.694
LAURA: Do you get an advantage at all?

01:06:36.694 --> 01:06:45.985
MATT: Nope, no longer blinded, no longer stunned.
You are considered currently grappled. All right,

01:06:45.985 --> 01:06:55.685
so for the action there-- as a bonus action he's
going to rear back, open his mouth, and attempt to

01:06:55.685 --> 01:06:57.297
bite towards your face.

01:06:57.297 --> 01:06:58.656
MARISHA: He's Mike Tyson-ing you.

01:06:58.656 --> 01:07:03.787
MATT: Correct. That is a 21.

01:07:03.787 --> 01:07:05.072
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:07:05.072 --> 01:07:17.073
MATT: You take ten points of damage, and you feel
teeth grasp on to the top of your lip, and with a

01:07:17.073 --> 01:07:22.327
sickening sharp, burning sensation, (wet ripping
noise) your upper lip is now torn from the front

01:07:22.327 --> 01:07:28.126
of your face. As you see Kern reel back, a streak
of blood spilling off in an arc as his head pulls

01:07:28.126 --> 01:07:36.020
back, a terrible grin creeping across his smile.
As you now see, this dull gray-colored, Grog

01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:40.064
flesh-toned piece of skin dangling bloodily from
his mouth.

01:07:40.064 --> 01:07:44.694
(disgusted noises)

01:07:44.694 --> 01:07:46.919
MARISHA: We can fix it!

01:07:46.919 --> 01:07:49.656
MATT: Your turn, currently grappled so you can't
move.

01:07:49.656 --> 01:07:52.162
TRAVIS: I would like to attempt to break that grapple.

01:07:52.162 --> 01:07:54.454
MATT: Okay. Make an athletics check.

01:07:54.454 --> 01:07:58.983
TRAVIS: That is 21.

01:07:58.983 --> 01:08:02.597
MATT: He rolled a 14. So you break from the
grapple. Still have your bonus action.

01:08:02.597 --> 01:08:04.691
TRAVIS: Both of my bonus actions, or all three?

01:08:04.691 --> 01:08:12.585
MATT: Actually, breaking from grapple-- let me
double-check. It uses an action, so yeah, it's

01:08:12.585 --> 01:08:15.198
your action. You still have a bonus action.

01:08:15.198 --> 01:08:24.501
TRAVIS: I blow through my newly lipless mouth,
(laughs) and I run up and

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:26.070
I throw my face into his.

01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:28.931
MATT: Okay! Go ahead and roll for your headbutt.

01:08:28.931 --> 01:08:31.132
TRAVIS: That's a 17.

01:08:31.132 --> 01:08:38.657
MATT: 17 misses. As you dodge forward, Kern
actually spits it toward you and it (squelch) hits

01:08:38.657 --> 01:08:43.843
you in the face, and for a second, it completely
throws you off. Your head still goes forward.

01:08:43.843 --> 01:08:49.832
However, as you look down, Kern has already
swished beneath you. The sheer speed is

01:08:49.832 --> 01:08:56.572
unexpected; he's now beneath looking up and grabs
the chunk of the lip that he had taken and comes

01:08:56.572 --> 01:08:58.168
up for a full round of attacks against you.

01:08:58.168 --> 01:08:59.666
TRAVIS: Wait, that was just my one attack.

01:08:59.666 --> 01:09:04.155
MATT: Oh, that's right. You still have-- No, you
used your action to break the grapple. So you're

01:09:04.155 --> 01:09:06.204
still grappled, so you can't move. So this
is his turn.

01:09:06.257 --> 01:09:07.515
TRAVIS: I broke the grapple!

01:09:07.515 --> 01:09:10.117
MATT: You did break the grapple, so yeah, you
could still move if you wanted to.

01:09:10.117 --> 01:09:12.100
TRAVIS: No, I'll stay there.

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:15.484
MATT: Okay. That is a 23.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:16.526
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:09:16.526 --> 01:09:20.636
MATT: 23. And a 12.

01:09:20.636 --> 01:09:22.343
TRAVIS: (sighs) Misses.

01:09:22.343 --> 01:09:27.061
MATT: So, grabs the lip in one hand, reaches up
and then (slam) uppercuts you from underneath for

01:09:27.061 --> 01:09:30.250
the first hit. That is seven points of damage.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:31.409
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:09:31.409 --> 01:09:36.328
MATT: The next one, however, is eight points of
damage. Swings up and actually haymakers you to

01:09:36.328 --> 01:09:40.848
the side with the hand still holding the chunk of
your lip in it (slamming impact) across the side

01:09:40.848 --> 01:09:50.170
of your face, and is going to attempt to do a
backwards leaping flip-kick. However, because Kern

01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:54.762
is not as practiced at this and is over-extending,
you see it telegraphed far in advance, and you

01:09:54.762 --> 01:09:58.766
duck out of the way, and it (whoosh) whiffs past.
Kern loses his balance for a minute and in an

01:09:58.766 --> 01:10:02.101
embarrassing moment almost falls over from his own
strike. Manages to catch himself and is like,

01:10:02.101 --> 01:10:07.440
"Nobody saw that, right?" That ends Kern's turn.
You're up.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.318
LAURA: (shouting) I saw that, Kern!

01:10:09.318 --> 01:10:12.372
TRAVIS: I reach forward, throw that leg towards
the right knee again.

01:10:12.372 --> 01:10:13.656
Still working on the same spot.

01:10:13.656 --> 01:10:15.310
MATT: Okay.

01:10:15.488 --> 01:10:16.469
TRAVIS: Miss.

01:10:16.469 --> 01:10:19.315
MATT: All right. Still have two more strikes.

01:10:19.315 --> 01:10:22.608
TRAVIS: That's a 21.

01:10:22.608 --> 01:10:24.368
MATT: 21 hits.

01:10:24.368 --> 01:10:29.863
TRAVIS: And I miss.

01:10:29.863 --> 01:10:35.592
MATT: Okay. So, you rush forward with your leg
(whoomph) he manages to duck out of the way,

01:10:35.592 --> 01:10:40.377
bringing his knee up to the side. Comes down to
try and get ready for the next attack; however,

01:10:40.377 --> 01:10:43.804
you already used that inertia of the kick to bring
your fist down (whack) right across the front of

01:10:43.804 --> 01:10:45.696
his face. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:10:45.696 --> 01:10:46.921
TRAVIS: That's an eight.

01:10:46.921 --> 01:10:53.456
MATT: Eight. All right. Okay, and the third
strike, you come out to follow that up with a full

01:10:53.456 --> 01:10:56.787
combo, at which point however, he reaches out,
(clutching noise) grabs the sides of your wrists

01:10:56.787 --> 01:11:02.006
with both of his hands and brings it down to where
you're now face-to-face again, left at his mercy

01:11:02.006 --> 01:11:07.044
at this point. You're off-balance and led towards
him. It's Kern's turn. Kern is going to reach back

01:11:07.044 --> 01:11:10.686
and attempt to headbutt you in the front. That is
a 21.

01:11:10.686 --> 01:11:11.809
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:11:11.809 --> 01:11:15.336
MATT: That is an 11.

01:11:15.336 --> 01:11:16.513
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:11:16.513 --> 01:11:18.054
MATT: And that's going to be a 22.

01:11:18.054 --> 01:11:19.144
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:11:19.144 --> 01:11:24.735
MATT: Just (whack) headbutts you right square in
the face. You reel back from it. He goes to

01:11:24.735 --> 01:11:29.159
headbutt again. This time you duck out of the way.
However, at that point, he pulls you closer in

01:11:29.159 --> 01:11:33.017
towards him, still holding your wrists to his
side, and he headbutts you a third time. So, the

01:11:33.017 --> 01:11:38.874
first headbutt does nine points of damage, and the
other one does seven points of damage.

01:11:38.874 --> 01:11:40.169
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:11:40.169 --> 01:11:46.406
MATT: (whack, whoosh, whack) Pulling you in, this
time releasing you from the sheer impact, pushing

01:11:46.406 --> 01:11:48.892
you back onto your feet. It's your go.

01:11:48.892 --> 01:11:50.357
TRAVIS: Am I back to the wall?

01:11:50.357 --> 01:11:51.986
MATT: You're pretty close to the wall, yeah.

01:11:51.986 --> 01:11:56.042
TRAVIS: I'd like to take a step back, put my back
foot on the wall, and then push off into the air

01:11:56.042 --> 01:11:57.789
with a huge overhand right.

01:11:57.789 --> 01:12:01.671
MATT: Nice! Okay, pushing off in the air and
arcing down with the fist.

01:12:01.671 --> 01:12:03.898
TRAVIS: That's a 22.

01:12:03.898 --> 01:12:04.741
MATT: 22 hits.

01:12:04.741 --> 01:12:07.592
TRAVIS: Eight points of damage.

01:12:07.592 --> 01:12:10.100
MATT: Eight points of damage. All righty.

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:15.549
TRAVIS: And then I say, you were supposed to be
the only lipless one. And I soccer ball the shit

01:12:15.549 --> 01:12:18.553
out of those dimes between his legs.

01:12:18.553 --> 01:12:20.185
(laughter)

01:12:20.185 --> 01:12:21.598
TRAVIS: Nice! 25.

01:12:21.598 --> 01:12:23.776
MATT: 25, that definitely hits.

01:12:23.776 --> 01:12:25.445
TRAVIS: That is seven.

01:12:25.445 --> 01:12:34.317
MATT: All righty. (whack) With another screeching
(howls in pain) your foot immediately cracks

01:12:34.317 --> 01:12:42.583
right. You've now repeatedly pummeled him into his
man-bits, and you can see there is a dark stain in

01:12:42.583 --> 01:12:46.475
his trousers when you pull your foot back. You've
definitely drawn blood in his nether regions.

01:12:46.514 --> 01:12:50.428
LAURA: Oh, Kord. That is painful.

01:12:50.428 --> 01:12:53.117
TRAVIS: Is he still standing? Is he bent over?

01:12:53.117 --> 01:12:57.176
MATT: He's standing partially bent forward,
clutching towards the severe pain in his nether

01:12:57.176 --> 01:12:58.146
regions.

01:12:58.146 --> 01:13:01.865
TRAVIS: What? Did you lose something? No? You'll
lose it now. And I do it again.

01:13:01.865 --> 01:13:03.154
MATT: All right.

01:13:03.154 --> 01:13:04.635
TRAVIS: 19.

01:13:04.635 --> 01:13:05.936
MATT: 19 just barely hits.

01:13:05.936 --> 01:13:07.695
(cheering)

01:13:07.695 --> 01:13:08.828
TRAVIS: Eight!

01:13:08.828 --> 01:13:10.159
MATT: Eight. All righty.

01:13:10.159 --> 01:13:11.629
TRAVIS: Thank you, Percy.

01:13:11.629 --> 01:13:21.672
MATT: (whack) A third hit. This time (guttural
cry) another howl in pain. Kern reaches down and

01:13:21.672 --> 01:13:25.622
clasps his hands once again, the same capture
maneuver he did with your fist, onto your ankle,

01:13:25.622 --> 01:13:31.192
and you can see the face goes from pain and his
eyes flash open with a blood-seething orc rage.

01:13:31.192 --> 01:13:35.479
Half-orc this may be; in this moment, Kern's gone
full orc.

01:13:35.479 --> 01:13:36.611
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:13:36.611 --> 01:13:42.182
MATT: And you can see (growls) on his turn, Kern
is going to, pulling your leg forward towards you.

01:13:42.182 --> 01:13:46.513
You feel yourself pulled off balance, and the
momentum pull you towards him as he unleashes

01:13:46.513 --> 01:13:47.931
another flurry of blows against you.

01:13:47.931 --> 01:13:52.413
SAM: As he does, I shout out from the audience
using my Cutting Words.

01:13:52.413 --> 01:13:54.063
MATT: What do you shout?

01:13:54.063 --> 01:13:58.607
SAM: Oh, Kern, do you need some dick? Because I
gave some to your mom last night!

01:13:58.607 --> 01:14:03.067
(laughing and jeering)

01:14:03.067 --> 01:14:05.141
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d10, and I'll subtract
it from his attack roll.

01:14:05.141 --> 01:14:06.141
SAM: d10?

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:07.719
ORION: That was a burn.

01:14:07.719 --> 01:14:09.387
SAM: Fuck! Only three.

01:14:09.387 --> 01:14:15.393
MATT: That's okay. So, his roll was a 21, that
brings it down to an 18. What's your armor class?

01:14:15.393 --> 01:14:16.539
TRAVIS: It's 18.

01:14:16.539 --> 01:14:17.673
MATT: 18, so it still hits.

01:14:17.673 --> 01:14:19.769
(dismayed shouting)

01:14:19.769 --> 01:14:24.003
MATT: Still, that was awesome! You can see there's
a momentary distraction as Kern glances over for a

01:14:24.003 --> 01:14:28.517
second angrily, but still follows through with the
first hit, this one clocking you straight in the

01:14:28.517 --> 01:14:36.685
face, sending your head back in severe pain. You
take ten points of damage. (whack) You fall

01:14:36.685 --> 01:14:45.783
backward, the force of the blow sending you onto
your heels. Second strike comes in at a 15. I

01:14:45.783 --> 01:14:46.791
believe that misses.

01:14:46.791 --> 01:14:48.131
TRAVIS: Oh, that misses. Yeah, sorry.

01:14:48.131 --> 01:14:56.410
MATT: That is-- oh, that's a natural 20. That puts
it at 12 points of damage on the third strike. As

01:14:56.410 --> 01:15:01.805
Kern comes forward, the second punch swings over
your head as you're still reeled back. The third

01:15:01.805 --> 01:15:07.049
one, he runs forward towards you as you're pushed
a few feet away and knees you right straight to

01:15:07.049 --> 01:15:12.525
the solar plexus, (gasps) the impact causing the
air to escape your lungs, and for a brief moment

01:15:12.525 --> 01:15:15.972
you're (gasping) having to pull the air back in.
It's your turn.

01:15:15.972 --> 01:15:16.909
TRAVIS: Right.

01:15:16.909 --> 01:15:22.496
MARISHA: So, is that-- I was just saying, if we
get another chant going--

01:15:22.496 --> 01:15:25.378
ALL: (chanting) Grog, Grog, Grog.

01:15:25.378 --> 01:15:30.231
MARISHA: Cover me. I cast Healing Word on Grog.

01:15:30.231 --> 01:15:34.600
MATT: All right, I'm going to ask you to do a
sleight-of-hand check.

01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:38.155
MARISHA: Okay. Do I get advantage because we're
all chanting together?

01:15:38.155 --> 01:15:40.105
MATT: Nope.

01:15:40.105 --> 01:15:42.350
ORION: What if I shot off a Prestidigitation
firework?

01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:43.440
LAURA: Nope.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:46.736
MARISHA: To help me out? Will it be a team
effort? No? All right.

01:15:46.786 --> 01:15:47.970
MATT: Doing this now.

01:15:47.970 --> 01:15:52.710
MARISHA: Oh, that's good, that's a 16. 18 total.

01:15:52.710 --> 01:15:59.947
MATT: (chuckles) As you begin casting, one of the
Bastions grabs your wrist and pulls you into his

01:15:59.947 --> 01:16:04.731
face and says, "I'm sorry, missy. Am I to
understand that you're cheating?"

01:16:04.731 --> 01:16:08.445
MARSHA: No! That's just the language of my
people.

01:16:08.445 --> 01:16:09.666
ORION: She's foreign.

01:16:09.666 --> 01:16:10.979
MARISHA: Yes, I'm foreign.

01:16:10.979 --> 01:16:14.916
MATT: Go ahead and make a deception roll. It would
be with disadvantage, but because Tiberius is

01:16:14.916 --> 01:16:17.453
helping you, we're just gonna make it
a straight roll.

01:16:17.478 --> 01:16:21.817
MARISHA: Deception?

01:16:21.817 --> 01:16:23.275
MATT: Deception.

01:16:23.275 --> 01:16:26.012
MARISHA: 11 total, because charisma.

01:16:26.012 --> 01:16:28.560
MATT: The Bastion says, "You're coming with me."

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:32.036
MARISHA: Why do I always get busted?

01:16:32.036 --> 01:16:36.617
ORION: Can I do something real quick?

01:16:36.617 --> 01:16:38.725
MATT: Scanlan was going to act first, and then
we'll get to you.

01:16:38.725 --> 01:16:40.578
ORION: I want to be like, excuse me, and I--
sorry.

01:16:40.578 --> 01:16:46.999
SAM: I said, I see this happening. I go over and I
use Friends to cast--

01:16:46.999 --> 01:16:51.771
MATT: As you're about to walk over, Tiberius puts
his hand out and goes--

01:16:51.771 --> 01:16:56.736
ORION: No! Excuse me. And I pull out ten gold
coins. That's all I actually have because I had

01:16:56.736 --> 01:17:01.258
ten left, (laughs) and I take those, and I give
them. I'm sorry. This has been a misunderstanding.

01:17:01.258 --> 01:17:06.400
She's foreign, and she's royalty. Please, I'm from
Draconia. She's from-- she's a druid. I say all

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.592
this shit really quick, and I'm like, I'm so, so
sorry.

01:17:08.592 --> 01:17:12.115
MARISHA: I worship the ever-loving unicorn,
Rainbow Fluffers.

01:17:12.115 --> 01:17:19.364
MATT: Make a deception check with disadvantage,
because he's already pissed off with this.

01:17:19.364 --> 01:17:25.525
ORION: What was it? Deception?

01:17:25.525 --> 01:17:27.953
MARISHA: He rolled a 12 and a 13.

01:17:27.953 --> 01:17:31.251
ORION: Deception? So that's 22 and 21.

01:17:31.251 --> 01:17:39.799
MATT: Okay. The Bastion glares at you, looks over
at one of the nearby Bastions. You see two

01:17:39.799 --> 01:17:46.078
manacles clank down on your wrists. Another
Bastion to your left and the Bastion that's

01:17:46.253 --> 01:17:49.517
holding you both says, "Apparently, she's got
people helping her out. Come on. We're dragging

01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:51.874
"her off." You both are being pulled away

01:17:51.874 --> 01:17:55.709
ORION: As they do that, I'm like, you said
dragon!

01:17:55.709 --> 01:17:58.840
MATT: You guys are being dragged away from the
Crucible. Grog.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:17:59.854
TRAVIS: It's my turn?

01:17:59.854 --> 01:18:00.741
MATT: It is your turn.

01:18:00.741 --> 01:18:02.614
TRAVIS: I come back from that knee to the solar
plexus.

01:18:02.614 --> 01:18:04.348
MARISHA: Right, guys, have fun! Root for Grog for
us!

01:18:04.348 --> 01:18:08.652
TRAVIS: I reach out and grab the back of his head,
and I drive my elbow straight into his chin.

01:18:08.652 --> 01:18:09.693
MATT: Go for it.

01:18:09.693 --> 01:18:12.506
TRAVIS: 25?

01:18:12.506 --> 01:18:13.652
MATT: 25 does hit.

01:18:13.652 --> 01:18:15.994
TRAVIS: Yes! Eight.

01:18:15.994 --> 01:18:17.078
MATT: All righty.

01:18:17.078 --> 01:18:24.349
TRAVIS: As it carries through, I'd like to come
back with a back elbow, same spot. Boom.

01:18:24.349 --> 01:18:26.938
MATT: All righty. Roll for an attack on that.

01:18:26.938 --> 01:18:29.555
TRAVIS: 16.

01:18:29.555 --> 01:18:35.028
MATT: No. (whoosh) Parries it to the side after
the first impact sets his jaw off to the side

01:18:35.028 --> 01:18:37.876
again. (crack) Snaps it back into place.

01:18:38.026 --> 01:18:38.865
TRAVIS: Last one?

01:18:38.865 --> 01:18:39.669
MATT: Last one.

01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:42.927
TRAVIS: Since I'm standing and I probably whiffed,
I see that knee that I've been working on, and I

01:18:42.927 --> 01:18:45.043
throw my heel out and try and pop it in.

01:18:45.043 --> 01:18:46.790
MATT: Okay.

01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:48.158
TRAVIS: Yes! 27.

01:18:48.158 --> 01:18:50.739
MATT: 27 does hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:18:50.739 --> 01:18:51.778
TRAVIS: Eight.

01:18:51.778 --> 01:18:59.883
MATT: Eight. All right. You go forward and (pop)
your foot finds the side of the knee, and the knee

01:18:59.883 --> 01:19:06.948
this time buckles under the weight (cracking) off
to the side. Kern falls onto one knee, puts both

01:19:06.948 --> 01:19:10.728
hands out on the ground, and (coughing) coughs up
this sputtering puddle of blood that then spills

01:19:10.728 --> 01:19:16.038
out on the ground. Kern looks like that blow is
about to knock Kern over to the side, but Kern

01:19:16.038 --> 01:19:23.194
sits there and tenses his muscles. His head whips
up at you, and that orcish glare, that sheer focus

01:19:23.194 --> 01:19:30.032
of fury that you saw once before, is holding him
on the edge. Kern looks up at you.

01:19:30.032 --> 01:19:37.079
"No, this is my town!" (roars)

01:19:37.079 --> 01:19:44.039
and leaps up at you with a flurry
of an extremely desperate half-orc. First strike

01:19:44.039 --> 01:19:46.590
comes at you. That is a 22 to hit.

01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:47.590
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:51.383
MATT: That is a 27 to hit.

01:19:51.383 --> 01:19:52.619
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:19:52.619 --> 01:19:54.170
MATT: And natural 20.

01:19:54.170 --> 01:19:56.426
(groaning)

01:19:56.426 --> 01:19:58.440
MATT: First strike is ten points of damage.

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:00.086
TRAVIS: Ten points. Okay.

01:20:00.086 --> 01:20:02.579
MATT: Next one is eight points of damage.

01:20:02.579 --> 01:20:03.869
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:20:03.869 --> 01:20:08.960
MATT: Last one which is eight, six, 14 points of
damage.

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.056
TRAVIS: Right, okay.

01:20:10.056 --> 01:20:11.163
MATT: What are you at?

01:20:11.163 --> 01:20:15.164
TRAVIS: So that puts me at negative 13. I use my
Relentless Rage.

01:20:15.164 --> 01:20:17.035
SAM: Oh! What is that?

01:20:17.035 --> 01:20:20.209
TALIESIN: Our little boy's growing up!

01:20:20.209 --> 01:20:28.546
MATT: So Grog is put in the negative as the orc
has pummeled you, and you feel (doosh, doosh), and

01:20:28.546 --> 01:20:32.882
with a final resounding crack, the knee comes up,
slamming you into your chin. You feel your body

01:20:32.882 --> 01:20:36.969
begin to fade. Your vision begin to dull to black.

01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:41.834
SAM: I just won 100 gold!

01:20:41.834 --> 01:20:44.799
MATT: At that point, you feel that seething anger, that

01:20:44.799 --> 01:20:50.771
rage, that medallion that was given to you, the
section of lip that is now missing from your face.

01:20:50.771 --> 01:20:53.658
Let me go and see what this is. Relentless Rage.

01:20:53.658 --> 01:20:58.730
ORION: For Philip! No, it's Grog now. I'm not
there; I'm arrested.

01:20:58.730 --> 01:21:00.944
MATT: All right, make a constitution saving throw
right now.

01:21:00.944 --> 01:21:03.567
TRAVIS: 21.

01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:06.664
MATT: 21. You instead drop to one hit point.

01:21:06.664 --> 01:21:08.096
TRAVIS: One hit point.

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:13.372
MATT: All of a sudden, the rage pulls you through,
and your whole body (whipping noise) snaps up into

01:21:13.372 --> 01:21:18.165
place again, and you can see Kern before you has
this grin on his face that he's just watched

01:21:18.165 --> 01:21:25.671
victory come to him, and then it's torn away. His
eyes open and that half-orcish rage suddenly fades

01:21:25.671 --> 01:21:31.880
for a second as you see, for the first time, deep
fear take the heart of your combatant.

01:21:32.008 --> 01:21:33.205
Take your turn.

01:21:33.205 --> 01:21:40.246
TRAVIS: I look at my arms, I look at him, I spit
blood into the sand, and I say, well, well. Where

01:21:40.246 --> 01:21:47.967
have I seen this happen before? Time's up. And I
run forward and in a massive arcing uppercut, I

01:21:47.967 --> 01:21:51.533
drive my fist under his jaw with everything I
have.

01:21:51.533 --> 01:21:53.319
MATT: Go ahead and roll for damage.

01:21:53.319 --> 01:21:54.915
TRAVIS: Oh, damage?

01:21:54.915 --> 01:21:56.123
MATT: Roll for attack.

01:21:56.123 --> 01:22:00.158
TRAVIS: Okay. Oh, shit. 18?

01:22:00.158 --> 01:22:05.909
MATT: 18? As you rush forward he, through the
fear, still brings his hand up and slaps the first

01:22:05.909 --> 01:22:07.933
hit out of the way. Second attack.

01:22:07.933 --> 01:22:14.282
TRAVIS: I look down and I say, (sighs) Very well,
respect. And I take my elbow and

01:22:14.282 --> 01:22:15.732
drive it into his temple.

01:22:15.732 --> 01:22:18.045
MATT: Roll for second attack.

01:22:18.045 --> 01:22:19.358
TRAVIS: 15.

01:22:19.358 --> 01:22:23.994
MATT: 15. The second one, brings back and parries
it to the side. (heavy breathing)

01:22:23.994 --> 01:22:29.240
LAURA: I lift up my shirt and I say, I love you,
Grog!

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:31.193
SAM: Oh my god, it's her tits! It's her tits!

01:22:31.193 --> 01:22:34.800
MATT: Through the fury of your rage--

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.304
SAM: She just showed her tits. That's inspiring!

01:22:37.304 --> 01:22:42.757
MATT: In this moment, if that were to distract
Grog, I'm afraid Grog would drop his rage.

01:22:42.757 --> 01:22:44.546
TRAVIS: (laughing) Don't, no.

01:22:44.546 --> 01:22:46.184
LAURA: Never mind! I put my shirt back on.

01:22:46.184 --> 01:22:52.615
MATT: However, the entire other side of the
Crucible right now is going (gasps, cheers) they

01:22:52.615 --> 01:23:02.858
all burst into cheers. Vax, by the way, is
standing behind you and going, "Sister!" and is

01:23:02.858 --> 01:23:05.471
pulling your shirt down for you, and is
desperately trying--

01:23:05.471 --> 01:23:06.987
LAURA: 600 gold!

01:23:06.987 --> 01:23:08.866
TRAVIS: I've missed the uppercut.

01:23:08.866 --> 01:23:10.248
MATT: Missed the elbow.

01:23:10.248 --> 01:23:11.277
TRAVIS: Missed the elbow.

01:23:11.277 --> 01:23:12.723
SAM: Can I sing from the audience?

01:23:12.723 --> 01:23:14.438
MATT: At this, not right now.

01:23:14.438 --> 01:23:15.671
SAM: It's all this roll.

01:23:15.671 --> 01:23:17.054
MATT: It's the middle of his turn.

01:23:17.054 --> 01:23:21.446
TRAVIS: I take both of my fists up over my head,
and I just bring it down.

01:23:21.446 --> 01:23:23.279
MATT: All right. Roll for it.

01:23:23.279 --> 01:23:26.508
TRAVIS: 13.

01:23:26.508 --> 01:23:35.161
MATT: 13. Kern simply slaps it out of your way,
and you can see the fear begin to fade, and for a

01:23:35.161 --> 01:23:41.221
second, looks at you and sees, truly, how close on
the edge you are. "Oh, you've proven yourself this

01:23:41.221 --> 01:23:48.720
"day, but there is only one champion of the
Crucible." You're up, Scanlan.

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:54.763
SAM: Yeah, so I was going sing to him to inspire.
I guess I can still try.

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:56.579
MATT: Yeah, go for it, what do you want to sing?

01:23:56.579 --> 01:24:04.656
SAM: I sing, (singing) with your arms, and your
fists, and your legs, and your wrists, it's in

01:24:04.656 --> 01:24:05.765
your head--

01:24:05.765 --> 01:24:08.709
ALL: (singing) In your head, you are fighting.

01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:10.581
SAM: That's all I got.

01:24:10.581 --> 01:24:14.966
MATT: d10 inspiration die to you, Grog, in this
pinnacle moment, so hold on to that d10.

01:24:14.966 --> 01:24:16.703
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:24:16.703 --> 01:24:25.618
MATT: All right. Kern, now intensely scared, is
using his action to go into his dodge maneuver.

01:24:25.618 --> 01:24:30.855
He's on the edge. You can see, one eye is swollen
shut and he (deep breath) goes into the stance to

01:24:30.855 --> 01:24:35.851
defend himself. However, as his bonus action, all
of a sudden takes two steps forward and almost

01:24:35.851 --> 01:24:43.337
Bruce Lee one-inch (whipping noise) punches to
your torso. That is nine plus eight. 17.

01:24:43.337 --> 01:24:44.501
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:24:44.501 --> 01:24:50.170
MATT: Misses. Goes to punch; however, the short
distance, while the speed is extreme, misjudged

01:24:50.170 --> 01:24:54.593
the distance and it stops an inch before your
chest. You look down, and it's barely stopping

01:24:54.593 --> 01:24:59.659
before it finds your chest. Looks up at you. "Come
at me."

01:24:59.659 --> 01:25:02.107
MARISHA: He just come-at-me-bro'd you!

01:25:02.107 --> 01:25:05.481
SAM: Is he in defense now?

01:25:05.481 --> 01:25:07.735
MATT: He's in dodge mode, yeah.

01:25:07.735 --> 01:25:09.360
SAM: He's in dodge, so it's at disadvantage?

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.277
MATT: So all of your attacks are at disadvantage.

01:25:11.277 --> 01:25:14.772
TRAVIS: I want to leap at him and try and grab him
around the waist.

01:25:14.772 --> 01:25:18.197
LAURA: Oh my god. Just hit him.

01:25:18.197 --> 01:25:19.527
MARISHA: Take him down!

01:25:19.527 --> 01:25:21.401
TRAVIS: I get three-- no.

01:25:21.401 --> 01:25:22.853
SAM: Just hit him!

01:25:22.853 --> 01:25:25.708
MATT: Do what you want, Grog. Do what you want.
What are you doing?

01:25:25.708 --> 01:25:31.257
TRAVIS: All right, fine, fuck it. With desperation
that this might fall away, I throw my goliath fist

01:25:31.257 --> 01:25:32.085
at him.

01:25:32.085 --> 01:25:35.585
MATT: All right, so first punch (grunts), with
disadvantage.

01:25:35.585 --> 01:25:38.037
TRAVIS: 19. Nine. 17.

01:25:38.037 --> 01:25:39.948
ORION: Plus ten!

01:25:39.948 --> 01:25:42.314
TRAVIS: 22!

01:25:42.314 --> 01:25:45.857
MATT: 22! (whoosh) Roll damage.

01:25:45.857 --> 01:25:47.867
TRAVIS: Eight!

01:25:47.867 --> 01:25:49.122
MATT: How do you want to do this?

01:25:49.122 --> 01:25:55.121
(cheering)

01:25:55.121 --> 01:26:01.682
MATT: (laughs) RIP ears, everyone.
Clutch Scanlan inspiration. Grog, how do you want

01:26:01.726 --> 01:26:03.134
to do this?

01:26:03.134 --> 01:26:10.527
TRAVIS: (chuckles) As the fist connects and he
starts to wobble, I reach over. I stand above him

01:26:10.527 --> 01:26:17.306
and grab around his waist with his back facing
towards me. I lift him up over my head so that his

01:26:17.306 --> 01:26:21.715
head gets to come up and look at the crowd one
last time before sending him straight back onto

01:26:21.715 --> 01:26:24.941
his shoulder blades and neck and smashing him into
the earth!

01:26:24.941 --> 01:26:31.879
MATT: (smash) With a resounding slam, Kern's body
impacts into the stone floor of the Crucible, a

01:26:31.879 --> 01:26:37.255
cloud of dirt and dust (whoosh) around. Rocks
break off and tumble down the side of the walls of

01:26:37.255 --> 01:26:41.411
the Crucible as the crowd has to stop themselves
from falling in from the sheer impact of the

01:26:41.411 --> 01:26:48.201
tremor that you've left slamming Kern. You can see
everyone fall silent; the crowd's cheers all come

01:26:48.201 --> 01:26:55.503
to a sudden halt. The dust settles. You can see
nothing at the base of the Crucible. As the cloud

01:26:55.503 --> 01:27:01.741
slowly comes to rest, you see there, broken and
laid out on the ground is an unconscious,

01:27:01.741 --> 01:27:08.478
bloodied, and ruined Kern, as Grog steps forward,
head hunched beneath his billowing shoulders,

01:27:08.478 --> 01:27:12.892
fists clenched in anger, victorious in the center
of the Crucible.

01:27:12.892 --> 01:27:18.912
TRAVIS: I put my foot on his chest and do my best
King Kong. (yells)

01:27:18.912 --> 01:27:25.764
MATT: At which point, the crowd raises into
shouting cheers, claps--

01:27:25.764 --> 01:27:27.646
LAURA: Did I show my boobs?!

01:27:27.646 --> 01:27:29.001
SAM: No.

01:27:29.001 --> 01:27:33.068
TALIESIN: None of us remember that. At all.

01:27:33.068 --> 01:27:43.179
MATT: The bookie screams out, "We have now a new
champion of the Crucible! Not Philip, but Grog,

01:27:43.179 --> 01:27:50.525
"the Victorious!" Cheers and shouts, and you hear
loud boos, even curses shouted. You see people

01:27:50.525 --> 01:27:57.172
shouting off, throwing empty coin purses off to
the side, different language-- it's a whole

01:27:57.172 --> 01:28:04.308
cacophony of cheers and curses, and then all of
them fall suddenly quiet. The whole crowd turns

01:28:04.308 --> 01:28:10.499
over to the edge of the Crucible. You see standing
over-- let me bring this down here for a moment of

01:28:10.499 --> 01:28:18.087
tension-- standing over to the edge, a hood is
thrown back on a figure that's been watching the

01:28:18.087 --> 01:28:30.181
entire fight. You notice this figure, as the hood
is thrown back: an older human man in his mid- to

01:28:30.181 --> 01:28:40.695
late-sixties with tough reddish tanned skin.
Short, but stocky. Receding gray hairline with a

01:28:40.695 --> 01:28:46.171
long, coarse gray beard that tumbles to his belt
line. He wears what looks like ceremonial robes of

01:28:46.171 --> 01:28:51.766
red and gold, simple wooden sandals, and a dark
brown necklace of large, two-inch round beads that

01:28:51.766 --> 01:28:57.803
adorn the shoulders and neck area. His body is
stout and ripped as muscle, trained over a

01:28:57.803 --> 01:29:02.911
lifetime of martial prowess and careful honing.
His arms are crossed as he looks down at the

01:29:02.911 --> 01:29:12.001
Crucible, down at you, Grog. Gives a nod and a
smile. Turns around and walks away from the crowd,

01:29:12.001 --> 01:29:22.486
quietly, as everyone silently takes in this
momentary experience. A few seconds pass, and then

01:29:22.486 --> 01:29:24.828
the crowd continues cheering once again.

01:29:24.828 --> 01:29:31.180
(cheering)

01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:36.666
MATT: The clerics now come climbing down to the
center of the Crucible to retrieve the unconscious

01:29:36.666 --> 01:29:42.815
and bleeding-out body of Kern, administering Heals
immediately to make sure he doesn't actually slip

01:29:42.815 --> 01:29:43.769
away from everyone.

01:29:43.769 --> 01:29:49.321
TRAVIS: I run over and grab my lip and pick it up
and go, just between you and me, is there anything

01:29:49.321 --> 01:29:50.681
we can do with this?

01:29:50.681 --> 01:29:52.663
(laughter)

01:29:52.663 --> 01:29:57.708
MATT: One of the clerics looks up for a second.
"Hold it there for a moment." And reaches out and

01:29:57.708 --> 01:30:05.673
administers a 5th-level Cure Wounds. He's making a
medicine check to see how-- well, that's a 16. You

01:30:05.673 --> 01:30:16.737
go ahead and heal-- that's shitty rolls-- ten. I
should've just rolled that one there. You heal 22

01:30:16.737 --> 01:30:23.399
hit points, but you feel your lip fuse, and while
it might leave a very small scar, it is in one

01:30:23.399 --> 01:30:27.761
piece. You might want to be careful about spitting
or anything too heavy with it for the next few

01:30:27.761 --> 01:30:31.397
days for fear of jettisoning it from the front of
your face accidentally.

01:30:31.397 --> 01:30:37.021
TRAVIS: Right, or growing a beard on it-- oh,
that's already on my chin.

01:30:37.021 --> 01:30:40.290
TALIESIN: If you grow enough beard, you can knit
it together to hold it in place.

01:30:40.290 --> 01:30:42.555
TRAVIS: I'm actually sweating.

01:30:42.555 --> 01:30:44.042
LAURA: Yeah. I am, too.

01:30:44.042 --> 01:30:48.073
MATT: You make your way up the rope ladder to the
top of the Crucible as the crowd-- some folks come

01:30:48.203 --> 01:30:52.987
up and cheer and grab your hand and shake it.
"Thank you. I believed you'd do this. Kern's been

01:30:52.987 --> 01:30:56.729
"sent in there too long. It's about time he got
taken down." (laughs) And he gets pushed out of

01:30:56.729 --> 01:31:01.837
the way by another person, a young guy, 16: scrawny
but excited, "You're my new hero. Oh my god. Oh,

01:31:01.837 --> 01:31:04.258
"Grog. Where did you learn to train? Can I train
with you?"

01:31:04.258 --> 01:31:14.648
TRAVIS: Grog's not here right now. This is Philip.
If you'd like to leave a message, come back another time.

01:31:14.816 --> 01:31:20.670
Got to go, bye! And I walk away. I find
Scanlan in the crowd, and I reach out and shake

01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:21.701
his hand.

01:31:21.701 --> 01:31:23.067
SAM: Ow!

01:31:23.067 --> 01:31:25.573
TRAVIS: Sorry, little bit of ongoing rage.

01:31:25.573 --> 01:31:29.875
TALIESIN: Scanlan, are you all right? You look a
little poorer, somehow. Have you lost money? You

01:31:29.875 --> 01:31:32.343
look like you've lost money. Especially in the
face.

01:31:32.343 --> 01:31:33.762
SAM: Well, it was worth it.

01:31:33.762 --> 01:31:38.919
TRAVIS: I heard your voices cutting through the
crowd. Where are Tiberius and Keyleth?

01:31:38.919 --> 01:31:44.857
ORION: Grog, we got arrested while you were
fighting, just so you know.

01:31:44.857 --> 01:31:48.762
MATT: You guys, by the way, right now are
currently brought to a small holding facility not

01:31:48.762 --> 01:31:53.879
far from the Crucible, where you've been set down
on a bench, both manacled and left while the one

01:31:53.879 --> 01:31:57.195
Bastion that originally found you is currently
keeping watch.

01:31:57.195 --> 01:31:58.152
TRAVIS: Outside?

01:31:58.152 --> 01:32:00.302
MATT: Out of vision of you guys. You don't see;
they're just missing.

01:32:00.302 --> 01:32:09.666
SAM: Grog, before we go deal with our friends, if
I may: That man fought a brave fight. I feel you

01:32:09.666 --> 01:32:15.080
should go make amends with him, it was a
respectable battle. You won't feel good about

01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:17.117
yourself unless you do.

01:32:17.117 --> 01:32:19.917
MATT: At which point, the bookie hands a sack of
gold right into your hand.

01:32:19.917 --> 01:32:23.020
"Well fought, new champion!" And hands it to you.

01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:29.542
TRAVIS: Fuck that shit. (laughs) I was about to,
but chaotic neutral, sorry!

01:32:29.542 --> 01:32:31.392
(laughter)

01:32:31.392 --> 01:32:32.431
ORION: Never mind.

01:32:32.431 --> 01:32:33.361
TRAVIS: I was ready.

01:32:33.361 --> 01:32:34.830
TALIESIN: And that, kids, is chaotic neutral.

01:32:34.830 --> 01:32:40.235
MATT: At three to one odds, that sack of gold you
get back contains 5,452 gold pieces.

01:32:40.282 --> 01:32:44.915
LAURA: You know what's so great about that, Grog?
You said you were going to pay back the gold you

01:32:44.915 --> 01:32:46.487
lost me in the first fight.

01:32:46.487 --> 01:32:52.769
TRAVIS: I did. And I pay it back happily as I look
at her dragon eyes of money hoarding.

01:32:52.769 --> 01:32:55.171
MATT: Okay. You go ahead and work out that payback to
her.

01:32:55.171 --> 01:32:56.288
LAURA: All right!

01:32:56.288 --> 01:32:58.916
ORION: I'm going to use the earring real quick
again. Whenever you're free, Grog.

01:32:58.948 --> 01:33:06.130
TRAVIS: And handing money to Vex has sobered me up
a little bit. I do walk over to Kern the Hammer

01:33:06.130 --> 01:33:10.247
and extend a hand and say, well fought, brother.

01:33:10.247 --> 01:33:14.100
MATT: His arms are currently draped over two of
the clerics that have pulled him out of the

01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:21.260
Crucible, face broken, blood streaked down one
side of his face. Is stepping with one foot,

01:33:21.297 --> 01:33:25.937
dragging the toes of the other. (grunts) Is
brought to turn around to face you by the two

01:33:25.937 --> 01:33:31.564
clerics and looks at you as you extend your hand.
Looks over at you. One eye swollen shut, the other

01:33:31.564 --> 01:33:36.059
glaring at you, bloodshot and angry. You see the
teeth are gritted and grinding beneath his

01:33:36.059 --> 01:33:48.386
still-busted, missing upper lip. (snarls, laughs)
"Well fought, goliath." And he (groans) brings one

01:33:48.386 --> 01:33:52.104
hand around one of the clerics and takes you in a
Beastmaster--

01:33:52.104 --> 01:33:53.995
TRAVIS: Yes! Strength and honor!

01:33:53.995 --> 01:34:02.304
MATT: However, there is no strength left. It's
barely there. He takes his hand back and it hangs

01:34:02.304 --> 01:34:10.774
loosely to one side, and he looks at you and says,
"I'm proud to have finally found my match. When I

01:34:10.809 --> 01:34:17.346
"recover, I'm going to find you, and I'm going to
want that championship back!"

01:34:17.346 --> 01:34:21.698
TRAVIS: When the time comes for a rematch, I'll be
here.

01:34:21.698 --> 01:34:26.915
MATT: "Good. Where can I find you, Grog?"

01:34:26.915 --> 01:34:28.467
TRAVIS: (quietly) Oh shit.

01:34:28.467 --> 01:34:32.090
SAM: Yeah, yeah. Just tell him.

01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:39.565
TRAVIS: If I'm not here at the Crucible, because I
don't think you need an audience for glory, you

01:34:39.565 --> 01:34:42.585
can always find me in Emon at Castle Greyskull.

01:34:42.585 --> 01:34:44.956
LAURA: Greyskull Keep!

01:34:44.956 --> 01:34:46.286
TRAVIS: Greyskull Keep!

01:34:46.286 --> 01:34:48.022
SAM: It's a real place.

01:34:48.022 --> 01:34:53.183
LAURA: Good luck with your dick, by the way. Sorry
about that.

01:34:53.183 --> 01:34:59.553
MATT: He looks over at you, (groans) and you see
for a minute he had forgotten about that in this

01:34:59.553 --> 01:35:06.086
exchange of honor, and some of the pain resurges,
and (moans) starts whimpering, (coughs up spit)

01:35:06.086 --> 01:35:10.910
spits off to the side this giant bloody loogie
that slaps on one of the sides of the cleric who's

01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:13.627
like, "Ugh!" Starts wiping it from the outside of
his tunic.

01:35:13.627 --> 01:35:22.854
Looks back at you. "Greyskull. So be it. Ow." And
hobbles away through a series of painful whimpers

01:35:22.985 --> 01:35:28.937
and whines. Percy, the bookie collects you. You
bet 500 at a three to one; that is four times

01:35:29.016 --> 01:35:30.578
return. You make 2,000 gold.

01:35:30.578 --> 01:35:31.885
TALIESIN: Beautiful!

01:35:31.885 --> 01:35:33.773
MARISHA: I've made 20 gold.

01:35:33.773 --> 01:35:37.106
MATT: You haven't made anything yet. You're
arrested.

01:35:37.106 --> 01:35:38.203
MARISHA: I'm arrested.

01:35:38.203 --> 01:35:41.523
MATT: 2,400 to you, Vex.

01:35:41.523 --> 01:35:42.624
LAURA: Fuck yeah!

01:35:42.624 --> 01:35:45.948
SAM: I'm here to collect my winnings, please.

01:35:45.948 --> 01:35:52.771
MATT: The Bastion laughs. "Then you would owe
me 300 gold."

01:35:52.771 --> 01:35:55.955
SAM: No, I bet on Grog, if you remember
correctly.

01:35:55.955 --> 01:36:00.010
MATT: "No, I have it here in my ledger that you
bet against your friend Grog."

01:36:00.010 --> 01:36:02.200
LAURA: Oh, he would never do that. I believe you
are mistaken, actually.

01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:09.086
SAM: There must be a typo. I bet on Grog. Don't
you remember?

01:36:09.086 --> 01:36:11.532
MATT: Are you casting something?

01:36:11.532 --> 01:36:13.549
SAM: Nope, I'm just doing this.

01:36:13.549 --> 01:36:17.067
MATT: Go ahead and make a deception roll.

01:36:17.067 --> 01:36:18.656
LAURA: Can I back him up?

01:36:18.656 --> 01:36:21.057
SAM: Nope.

01:36:21.057 --> 01:36:23.299
MATT: What did you roll?

01:36:23.299 --> 01:36:29.135
SAM: Two. Well, wait. What is this, deception or
persuasion? What is this?

01:36:29.135 --> 01:36:30.672
LAURA: Deception. Oh, that's so high!

01:36:30.672 --> 01:36:31.868
MATT: Deception.

01:36:31.868 --> 01:36:33.529
SAM: Yeah, it's 15. No, it's not good, no.

01:36:33.529 --> 01:36:36.974
MATT: He gives you a look and goes, "No, you did
not."

01:36:36.974 --> 01:36:42.388
SAM: I've got to work on this.

01:36:42.388 --> 01:36:47.096
MATT: And he whips around and takes his cloak
around, dismissing you, taking you out of the

01:36:47.096 --> 01:36:49.470
conversation, and walks back towards the Bellows'
Respite Inn.

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:56.768
ORION: Can I now use the damn earring? Okay. Grog,
(stutters) could you use your clout to get us out

01:36:56.768 --> 01:36:57.889
of holding?

01:36:57.889 --> 01:37:01.409
TRAVIS: What? You're in holding? Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm a pretty big deal.

01:37:01.409 --> 01:37:05.676
LAURA: What's going on? You were arrested? Why?

01:37:05.676 --> 01:37:08.887
ORION: Because Keyleth tried to do something, and
I tried to talk her out of it and it didn't work

01:37:08.887 --> 01:37:10.709
out, and we're now in holding. It's
fine.

01:37:10.768 --> 01:37:12.634
MARISHA: Oh, bullshit, you tried to talk me out of
it.

01:37:12.634 --> 01:37:13.873
LAURA: You tried to talk out what?

01:37:13.873 --> 01:37:15.114
ORION: I mean, I tried to help her out.

01:37:15.114 --> 01:37:18.182
TRAVIS: Tiberius, what can you see around you?

01:37:18.182 --> 01:37:21.063
ORION: A guard looking at me.

01:37:21.063 --> 01:37:23.689
LAURA: Can I track them?

01:37:23.689 --> 01:37:26.690
MATT: Make a survival check.

01:37:26.690 --> 01:37:34.787
TALIESIN: If someone were to be an idiot, where
would you take them to hold them?

01:37:34.787 --> 01:37:36.872
LAURA: 16.

01:37:36.872 --> 01:37:40.756
MATT: Because you know their tracks, their
footprints-- I would put it at a disadvantage, but

01:37:40.756 --> 01:37:44.976
that would cancel it out. At a 16, you
look around. You can see there is a track of two

01:37:45.029 --> 01:37:49.466
people with their feet being dragged behind two
heavy footprints by heavily armored individuals

01:37:49.466 --> 01:37:53.975
that lead. There are three buildings off to the side
and there is what looks to be a small station for

01:37:54.018 --> 01:38:03.153
holding, a general Bastion satellite station
within this portion of the Braving Grounds.

01:38:03.225 --> 01:38:06.055
LAURA: Can we go over and knock?

01:38:06.055 --> 01:38:12.144
MATT: You knock. A few seconds pass and the door
slides open a little bit, and from the inside, you

01:38:12.188 --> 01:38:17.745
can see a partially scarred on one cheek, late
thirties, early forties gentleman who looks

01:38:17.745 --> 01:38:21.888
square-jawed and definitely trained in some
semblance of looking gruff and angry and says,

01:38:21.888 --> 01:38:23.323
"Can I help you?"

01:38:23.323 --> 01:38:29.374
LAURA: Hi, yes. I'm looking for-- (sighs) I'm
looking for a couple of people. They're actually

01:38:29.374 --> 01:38:33.073
mental patients, and they've gotten loose.

01:38:33.073 --> 01:38:34.343
ORION: Vex! Here we are!

01:38:34.343 --> 01:38:38.521
LAURA: Oh! That's them, I'm afraid.

01:38:38.521 --> 01:38:41.352
MATT: "These two cheaters over here? These are the
ones you're looking for?"

01:38:41.352 --> 01:38:49.354
LAURA: Cheaters? Well, that makes sense. They
don't understand normal social rules.

01:38:49.354 --> 01:38:51.346
ORION: I'm from Draconia!

01:38:51.346 --> 01:38:57.615
MARISHA: And I'm also... not from here.

01:38:57.615 --> 01:38:59.952
LAURA: You see what I'm talking about?

01:38:59.952 --> 01:39:02.681
MATT: Go ahead and make a deception check.

01:39:02.681 --> 01:39:06.154
ORION: Just say where you're from. That's easy.

01:39:06.154 --> 01:39:10.460
MARISHA: Zephra. But they don't know what that
means.

01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:13.768
ORION: I'm sure they don't know what Draconia is,
but I like to spread the word.

01:39:13.768 --> 01:39:14.953
LAURA: 24.

01:39:14.953 --> 01:39:23.082
MATT: 24. Okay. He gives you a look and says,
"Well, look. We have reason to believe they may

01:39:23.102 --> 01:39:28.296
"have been trying to fix and/or rig the bets on the
recent bout out here in the Crucible. That is a very

01:39:28.355 --> 01:39:30.619
"serious offense here in the Braving Grounds."

01:39:30.648 --> 01:39:32.502
LAURA: I can imagine it would be, yes.

01:39:32.502 --> 01:39:35.503
MATT: "However, I don't want to deal with the
processing and the time it takes, so if these are

01:39:35.503 --> 01:39:39.737
"indeed your charges and you're willing to fill out
some paperwork and pay the fines right now, we'll

01:39:39.737 --> 01:39:40.949
"relinquish them to you."

01:39:40.949 --> 01:39:43.116
SAM: Well, what's the fine? How much was the
fine?

01:39:43.116 --> 01:39:43.971
MATT: Who are you?

01:39:43.971 --> 01:39:45.379
LAURA: Oh, he's my lawyer.

01:39:45.379 --> 01:39:56.716
SAM: I'm Burt Reynolds, esquire. I'm an attorney
at large. I represent all manner of escaped

01:39:56.716 --> 01:39:58.969
mental patients. (laughs)

01:39:59.394 --> 01:40:01.501
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:40:01.501 --> 01:40:03.239
TRAVIS: The mustache is up.

01:40:03.239 --> 01:40:04.791
SAM: 20.

01:40:04.791 --> 01:40:10.560
MATT: "Very well, small Reynolds, sir."

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:15.882
SAM: If you would like us to fill out the
paperwork. I have about two reams of paperwork for

01:40:15.882 --> 01:40:21.637
you to fill out, to release them to us, as
well. And also there will be court costs involved,

01:40:21.637 --> 01:40:27.978
oh boy, in triplicate. You'll have to get your
supervisor to fill out this one, and I will need

01:40:27.978 --> 01:40:30.210
this one, and I will need this one, as well--

01:40:30.210 --> 01:40:32.626
MATT: "500 gold's fine, and we'll release them to
you. All right? Is that fine?"

01:40:32.626 --> 01:40:36.466
SAM: Oh, 500 gold. That's fine. And they'll still
get to collect their winnings from the pit?

01:40:36.466 --> 01:40:38.789
MATT: "I don't care what they're going to do, just
take them from me!"

01:40:38.789 --> 01:40:46.122
SAM: Great, thank you sir. You know what, I can
make this paperwork disappear. This is fine.

01:40:46.122 --> 01:40:49.296
LAURA: Actually, for a small-- never mind.

01:40:49.296 --> 01:40:51.313
TALIESIN: Just let it go.

01:40:51.313 --> 01:41:00.190
LAURA: I noped myself on that one. Here you are,
500 gold.

01:41:00.190 --> 01:41:03.074
MATT: He collects it and ushers over the other
Bastion, who comes over and takes off your

01:41:03.074 --> 01:41:07.160
manacles and escorts you to the door and says,
"However, if I see either of you two causing any

01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:12.477
"trouble anywhere in Vasselheim, it's down to the
oubliette you go, you hear me?"

01:41:12.599 --> 01:41:15.643
SAM: Say that word again? What? Oubliette?

01:41:15.643 --> 01:41:20.738
MATT: "The Amaranthine oub-lie-blah-bloo. What is wrong
with me? Get out of here! Run!"

01:41:20.738 --> 01:41:22.012
(laughter)

01:41:22.012 --> 01:41:25.208
SAM: You've been bested. (laughs)

01:41:25.208 --> 01:41:30.679
MATT: You've out-talked the talker as the guard
finds himself so flustered by the frustration and

01:41:30.679 --> 01:41:36.204
anger that he's been caused by this entire strange
arrival of individuals, his speech pattern has

01:41:36.204 --> 01:41:41.388
been muddled, and in frustration shoves both of
you out the front door and slams it behind you.

01:41:41.388 --> 01:41:43.275
ORION: As I leave, he's speaking Draconian!

01:41:43.275 --> 01:41:45.738
SAM: I think he's having an aneurysm.

01:41:45.738 --> 01:41:47.691
ORION: He's speaking Draconian! I heard him.

01:41:47.691 --> 01:41:51.326
LAURA: You guys! What were you trying to do? Cast
magic?

01:41:51.326 --> 01:41:57.041
ORION: She casted heal and I tried to talk her out
of it, and I just got arrested, too.

01:41:57.041 --> 01:41:59.618
SAM: Thank goodness you are being represented by
an Ace Attorney.

01:41:59.618 --> 01:42:02.920
ORION: Hold it!

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:09.461
LAURA: He won! Let's go get your winnings, because
I think that should cover the amount I just spent

01:42:09.461 --> 01:42:10.969
on getting you out of jail.

01:42:10.969 --> 01:42:12.352
MARISHA: Yes! I'm owed 20 gold!

01:42:12.352 --> 01:42:14.760
TRAVIS: Tiberius, thank you for your efforts. You,
as well, Keyleth.

01:42:14.891 --> 01:42:17.508
MARISHA: Oh, I'm so happy you won, Grog.

01:42:17.508 --> 01:42:18.376
TRAVIS: Thank you.

01:42:18.376 --> 01:42:19.354
MARISHA: So happy.

01:42:19.354 --> 01:42:20.913
TRAVIS: I'm the champion.

01:42:20.954 --> 01:42:24.238
MARISHA: I wish I could've seen, because
I was eating my binder out of stress.

01:42:24.296 --> 01:42:28.458
MATT: As you guys make your way back to the
Bellows' Respite Inn, you manage to find the one

01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:32.842
Bastion who acts as the bookie, who is currently
halfway through a very heavy pint and chatting

01:42:32.883 --> 01:42:36.648
with one of his friends, and you can hear there are
stories now. People are retelling the tale of the

01:42:36.648 --> 01:42:40.130
battle in the Cauldron of the rise of Grog the
Victorious.

01:42:40.130 --> 01:42:44.684
ORION: When we're released, I would like 
to get my winnings back.

01:42:44.684 --> 01:42:47.424
MATT: That's where you guys are going: to the
bookie who keeps them.

01:42:47.463 --> 01:42:48.952
TRAVIS: Are we in the tavern?

01:42:48.952 --> 01:42:50.704
MARISHA: Hey, Grog! They're talking about you.

01:42:50.704 --> 01:42:52.495
MATT: You guys are now in the Bellows' Respite,
yes.

01:42:52.495 --> 01:42:56.876
TRAVIS: Are there any small lads running about or
maybe excited to see me or something?

01:42:56.876 --> 01:43:02.244
MATT: As you guys enter the tavern, there is a
sudden bit of whispered quiet. "Shh! There he is!"

01:43:02.244 --> 01:43:06.342
And all the tales fall to an end and the place
falls quiet as everyone stares at you as you

01:43:06.342 --> 01:43:10.179
enter. (heavy footstep sounds) Stepping in.

01:43:10.179 --> 01:43:12.593
TRAVIS: Are there any younger men that are--

01:43:12.593 --> 01:43:18.621
MATT: (shushing noises) There are maybe two men
looking like late teens to early twenties

01:43:18.621 --> 01:43:25.105
who saw the fight and are currently like wide
doe-eyed, seeing a hero before them.

01:43:25.105 --> 01:43:29.908
TRAVIS: I walk over to one of them and I pull out
a gold coin and I say, how would you like to make

01:43:29.908 --> 01:43:31.491
a gold coin, son?

01:43:31.491 --> 01:43:32.753
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

01:43:32.753 --> 01:43:34.091
TRAVIS: Wait!

01:43:34.091 --> 01:43:39.400
MATT: "From you, Grog the Victorious? Of course!
What can I do?"

01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:44.569
TRAVIS: I reach into the Bag of Holding. I take
out the second-place medal, the participant medal,

01:43:44.569 --> 01:43:46.903
and I go, make sure Kern gets this.

01:43:46.903 --> 01:43:49.521
(laughter)

01:43:49.521 --> 01:43:53.775
MATT: He reads it. (chuckles) "Yes. Yes, indeed.
Of course." And he runs off.

01:43:53.775 --> 01:43:55.199
TRAVIS: You sick fucks!

01:43:55.199 --> 01:43:57.308
(laughter)

01:43:57.308 --> 01:44:01.284
SAM: Well, I mean, come on. You came into a bar
looking for young boys.

01:44:01.284 --> 01:44:02.974
What was I supposed to think?

01:44:02.974 --> 01:44:07.865
MARISHA: We're together now. We're not arrested
anymore. You don't have to keep doing this. All

01:44:07.865 --> 01:44:11.019
right! To Grog the Victorious!

01:44:11.019 --> 01:44:12.881
ALL: To Grog!

01:44:12.881 --> 01:44:16.281
MATT: The bookie gives you your coin purse of 20
gold.

01:44:16.281 --> 01:44:20.352
MARISHA: You guys, this really makes gambling so
much fun.

01:44:20.352 --> 01:44:22.302
SAM: Don't make a habit of it.

01:44:22.302 --> 01:44:28.279
MATT: Tiberius, you get your coin purse of 2,448.

01:44:28.279 --> 01:44:29.709
ORION: Great, wonderful.

01:44:29.709 --> 01:44:31.539
TALIESIN: But you owe--

01:44:31.539 --> 01:44:33.324
ORION: No, she's paying for that.

01:44:33.324 --> 01:44:35.343
LAURA and TALIESIN: She's got 20 gold.

01:44:35.343 --> 01:44:36.783
ORION: She had other gold.

01:44:36.783 --> 01:44:39.220
MARISHA: I bought a nice meal for you the other
night.

01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:41.533
LAURA: That's true. She bought a couple of nice
meals for you.

01:44:41.533 --> 01:44:43.144
ORION: Oh, shit! That's right. I'll pay you.

01:44:43.144 --> 01:44:44.722
SAM: I lost 100 gold.

01:44:44.722 --> 01:44:45.803
ORION: What was it? 24?

01:44:45.803 --> 01:44:47.443
MATT: 2,448 was the number.

01:44:47.443 --> 01:44:49.089
LAURA: So I guess I broke even.

01:44:49.089 --> 01:44:50.494
TALIESIN: You still netted a profit.

01:44:50.494 --> 01:44:57.044
MATT: If you want to take the 500 from that,
(mutters quietly) minus 500... 1,948.

01:44:57.044 --> 01:44:58.584
SAM: That fight was amazing.

01:44:58.584 --> 01:44:59.951
MARISHA: That was fantastic.

01:44:59.951 --> 01:45:05.442
MATT: I was going to say, as you guys celebrate
with a joyous drink of ale here at the Bellows'

01:45:05.442 --> 01:45:09.563
Respite Inn to celebrate the victory of not
Philip, but Grog the Victorious in the Cauldron

01:45:09.563 --> 01:45:18.755
here in the Braving Grounds of Vasselheim in the
northwestern region of the countryside, we will go

01:45:18.755 --> 01:45:22.628
and take a quick restroom break, return here in
about five minutes. See you guys here shortly.

01:45:22.628 --> 01:45:24.358
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:45:24.358 --> 01:58:18.756
[break]

01:58:18.806 --> 01:58:22.178
MATT: Welcome back, guys. Welcome back! We are
returning as the party has finished their

01:58:22.178 --> 01:58:28.870
celebration, drinking hard through the afternoon,
celebrating Grog's victory at the Crucible.

01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:40.385
LIAM: Was that amazing, or was that amazing? I've
never seen anything like that, at all! Cheers to

01:58:40.385 --> 01:58:42.169
you, big man.

01:58:42.169 --> 01:58:43.273
TRAVIS: Thanks, bud.

01:58:43.273 --> 01:58:44.522
SAM: L'chaim!

01:58:44.522 --> 01:58:45.650
MARISHA and LAURA: Cheers!

01:58:45.650 --> 01:58:46.827
ORION: I raise my glass of water and cheers, as
well.

01:58:46.827 --> 01:58:47.947
TRAVIS: Thank you, Tiberius.

01:58:47.947 --> 01:58:49.621
MATT: Y'all enjoy our applesauce.

01:58:49.621 --> 01:58:51.678
TRAVIS: Or glass of water.

01:58:51.678 --> 01:58:53.119
MATT: Apple juice.

01:58:53.119 --> 01:58:54.482
LAURA: Good apple juice.

01:58:54.482 --> 01:58:55.772
MATT: Very good apple juice.

01:58:55.772 --> 01:58:58.387
TALIESIN: Be gentle with that. Apples don't grow
on trees.

01:58:58.387 --> 01:59:00.644
LIAM: This episode of Critical Role brought to you
by Mott's!

01:59:00.644 --> 01:59:11.283
MATT: Mott's Irish apple juice. All right! With
that bit of business with the Crucible currently

01:59:11.283 --> 01:59:15.636
taken care of, the rest of your path is your own.
What do you wish to do?

01:59:15.636 --> 01:59:20.777
LAURA: (stuttering) Money? Kraghammer?

01:59:20.777 --> 01:59:22.635
TALIESIN: Emon by way of Kraghammer.

01:59:22.635 --> 01:59:25.182
MARISHA: Is there anything else we want to do
while we're here?

01:59:25.182 --> 01:59:26.550
ORION: No!

01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:28.774
MARISHA: Are we over this town? Over this city?

01:59:28.774 --> 01:59:33.206
TALIESIN: I just need to pick up a little bit of
ore on the way out so I can work on making some

01:59:33.206 --> 01:59:35.072
more ammunition on the way to Kraghammer.

01:59:35.072 --> 01:59:41.452
ORION: I like that idea. We could take the airship
and you could craft some things. When we do go, I

01:59:41.452 --> 01:59:45.748
think I might have an idea for our carpet
situation.

01:59:45.748 --> 01:59:46.835
SAM: Oh?!

01:59:46.835 --> 01:59:47.715
MARISHA: Really?

01:59:47.715 --> 01:59:49.037
SAM: Your Wheel of Mending, perhaps?

01:59:49.037 --> 01:59:50.353
ORION: No, that didn't work.

01:59:50.353 --> 01:59:51.873
LIAM: We tried that. It didn't work.

01:59:51.873 --> 01:59:58.374
ORION: It kept it intact. But when we return to
House Thunderbrand, I believe we have a few items

01:59:58.374 --> 02:00:05.400
that they want. The deal was when we procure
certain items, we will be allowed to have certain

02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:14.615
information and certain-- we didn't explain what
we were going to get. But we should return, get

02:00:14.615 --> 02:00:17.289
our gold, and definitely visit House
Thunderbrand.

02:00:17.289 --> 02:00:19.426
LAURA: Right. 'Cause they have magic things.

02:00:19.426 --> 02:00:23.718
ORION: They are strongly arcane. Perhaps they can
enchant for what we have procured for them in

02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:28.515
that venture. And maybe that could be a good way
of getting around getting our carpet re-enchanted

02:00:28.555 --> 02:00:30.185
without costing any coin.

02:00:30.185 --> 02:00:31.479
TALIESIN: We'll prod that.

02:00:31.479 --> 02:00:35.373
LIAM: Can they make me unsee my sister's boobies?

02:00:35.373 --> 02:00:39.393
LAURA: You didn't see them! You were behind me, so
shut up. What are you doing all the

02:00:39.393 --> 02:00:41.147
way over there, anyway?

02:00:41.278 --> 02:00:42.558
SAM: I saw them. I saw them!

02:00:42.558 --> 02:00:44.629
ORION: Scanlan? When you describe them to me?

02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:46.348
SAM: I will draw them in great detail.

02:00:46.348 --> 02:00:47.276
ORION: Thank you.

02:00:47.276 --> 02:00:48.520
MARISHA: I wasn't there, either!

02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:49.591
LAURA: How about no?

02:00:49.591 --> 02:00:57.301
TALIESIN: In great details of the internet. Just
saying. I went there. It was already there.

02:00:57.301 --> 02:01:02.557
LAURA: I was caught up in a moment of passion! I'm
sorry!

02:01:02.557 --> 02:01:04.507
TALIESIN: Too late!

02:01:04.507 --> 02:01:07.127
SAM: She would do anything for you, Grog!

02:01:07.127 --> 02:01:09.938
LAURA: Anything for you and for the 600 gold that
that I put on your fight.

02:01:09.938 --> 02:01:11.460
SAM: Oh, it was for the money!

02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:15.241
LIAM: Listen, I was right there. There was no
other way around that situation.

02:01:15.241 --> 02:01:17.433
TALIESIN: You did what you had to.

02:01:17.433 --> 02:01:21.827
SAM: Listen. I would show any part of me for,
like, two gold.

02:01:21.827 --> 02:01:23.282
TRAVIS: Here's two gold.

02:01:23.282 --> 02:01:26.683
SAM: Here, take a look at my third nipple!

02:01:26.683 --> 02:01:28.639
LAURA: On your body?

02:01:28.639 --> 02:01:31.462
SAM: It can be wherever I put it, really. It's
magical.

02:01:31.462 --> 02:01:34.402
ORION: It's a piece of gum!

02:01:34.402 --> 02:01:39.493
LIAM: I have no idea what's going on.

02:01:39.493 --> 02:01:42.627
SAM: We're all together. That's what's going on.

02:01:42.627 --> 02:01:44.370
MARISHA: I love this tavern.

02:01:44.370 --> 02:01:48.131
ORION: What is closer to Kraghammer? Emon? Or
where we're from?

02:01:48.131 --> 02:01:51.717
TALIESIN: It's halfway. I think Kraghammer is in
between us and Emon.

02:01:51.717 --> 02:01:56.744
MATT: No. Actually, from where you guys are
currently, across the Ozmit Sea is Emon, which is

02:01:56.744 --> 02:02:01.149
the port city in Tal'Dorei, and then Kraghammer is
maybe two days' travel.

02:02:01.208 --> 02:02:03.149
LAURA: So we gotta stop into Emon first.

02:02:03.203 --> 02:02:04.783
ORION: Oh, that's fine. Are we all ready to go?

02:02:04.783 --> 02:02:05.826
MARISHA: What time is it?

02:02:05.826 --> 02:02:09.112
MATT: By now, I'd say it's probably 1:00 in the
afternoon, since that fight's happened.

02:02:09.112 --> 02:02:10.524
MARISHA: Y'all, we're day drunk!

02:02:10.524 --> 02:02:11.762
ORION: Are we ready to go?

02:02:11.762 --> 02:02:13.314
TRAVIS: We're getting ore, right?

02:02:13.314 --> 02:02:15.301
MARISHA: We're celebrating Grog, right?

02:02:15.301 --> 02:02:16.675
TRAVIS: Doesn't Percy want ore?

02:02:16.675 --> 02:02:20.660
TALIESIN: It's not hard to get a little bit of
ore. I'm just going to pick up some.

02:02:20.660 --> 02:02:25.182
ORION: After that, are we ready to go?

02:02:25.182 --> 02:02:33.137
SAM: Well, maybe. There's two more things that I
have unanswered questions for. First of all, you

02:02:33.137 --> 02:02:37.266
said we were going to stop on the way to get a new
carpet or to get our carpet repaired?

02:02:37.266 --> 02:02:41.171
ORION: We need to go to Kraghammer to collect our
30,000 gold waiting for us.

02:02:41.171 --> 02:02:42.913
LAURA: 25,000.

02:02:42.913 --> 02:02:49.677
ORION: 25,000, sorry. While we're there, House
Thunderbrand. We've procured a few items, or at

02:02:49.677 --> 02:02:56.236
least one, while we were down in the Underdark. We
should return there and talk to them and perhaps

02:02:56.236 --> 02:03:00.386
in exchange for gold, perhaps have them enchant the
carpet to fly again.

02:03:00.386 --> 02:03:07.633
SAM: That is a smart idea. That's great. Before we
leave though, does anyone have a nagging, tugging

02:03:07.674 --> 02:03:14.448
feeling about that cloaked human who praised your
performance? Should we investigate that at all?

02:03:14.448 --> 02:03:17.150
TRAVIS: He had a lovely beard!

02:03:17.150 --> 02:03:22.232
SAM: Well, that makes something. Could we at least
find out who he was before we leave town?

02:03:22.232 --> 02:03:24.031
LAURA: Oh, bartender!

02:03:24.031 --> 02:03:29.550
MATT: At which point, you see off to the side
Once-Lucky Ned, the barkeep, looks over.

02:03:29.550 --> 02:03:32.227
"Yes, yes? You have a question?"

02:03:32.227 --> 02:03:37.525
LAURA: Yes. That bearded, hooded gentleman at the
end of the fight, yeah?

02:03:37.525 --> 02:03:41.733
MATT: Thinks for a second. "Oh, you mean--"

02:03:41.733 --> 02:03:43.655
LAURA: The one that everyone was quiet for.

02:03:43.655 --> 02:03:44.981
MARISHA: The red and gold robes.

02:03:44.981 --> 02:03:47.124
LAURA: What? Who? Who is he?

02:03:47.124 --> 02:03:49.746
MATT: "You're certainly not from around here, are
you?"

02:03:49.746 --> 02:03:50.868
LAURA: I'm not.

02:03:50.868 --> 02:03:55.292
MATT: Looks around. "That was Earthbreaker
Groon."

02:03:55.292 --> 02:03:56.858
SAM: Earthbaker Groon?

02:03:56.858 --> 02:03:57.954
MATT: "Earthbreaker Groon."

02:03:57.954 --> 02:04:00.531
ALL: Earthbreaker Groon.

02:04:00.531 --> 02:04:02.043
TRAVIS: That's a great name!

02:04:02.043 --> 02:04:03.860
ORION: Where does he hail from?

02:04:03.860 --> 02:04:08.964
MATT: "He's the Dawn Marshal of the entirety of
these here Braving Grounds."

02:04:08.964 --> 02:04:11.167
MARISHA: Dawn Marshal?

02:04:11.216 --> 02:04:18.624
MATT: "He's the Dawn Marshal. He is the highest
esteemed cleric of the church of Kord, the Trial

02:04:18.624 --> 02:04:26.739
"Forge itself, in the center of this city, this
portion, this district. Well, he is the very top

02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:30.340
"of the entire hierarchy underneath Kord's strength
and watch."

02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:32.207
LAURA: And he nodded!

02:04:32.207 --> 02:04:38.473
MATT: "Apparently, he was summoned to watch this
fight and approved of your prowess in battle."

02:04:38.473 --> 02:04:39.821
LAURA: What does that mean?

02:04:39.821 --> 02:04:41.347
MATT: "I have no fucking clue!"

02:04:41.347 --> 02:04:42.892
(laughter)

02:04:42.892 --> 02:04:45.318
MATT: "But that's an honor is what that is, and
appreciate that yourself."

02:04:45.318 --> 02:04:50.658
TRAVIS: Aye, and I do. If I wanted to find this
Earthbreaker Groom--

02:04:50.658 --> 02:04:53.329
MATT: "Groon. With an N."

02:04:53.329 --> 02:04:57.091
TRAVIS: Oh. Groon. Right. The other one's weird.
Would I find him in the

02:04:57.091 --> 02:04:59.151
middle of the Trial Forge?

02:04:59.151 --> 02:05:00.456
MATT: "Most likely."

02:05:00.456 --> 02:05:04.011
MARISHA: So this guy's like the Pope of Kord?

02:05:04.011 --> 02:05:06.084
MATT: "Pope?"

02:05:06.084 --> 02:05:13.910
ORION: What is a Pope? It's okay. She's young.
Thank you for the information.

02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:15.214
MARISHA: I'm foreign!

02:05:15.214 --> 02:05:17.492
ORION: And foreign. Have a good day.

02:05:17.492 --> 02:05:18.732
MATT: "Thank you."

02:05:18.732 --> 02:05:20.174
TALIESIN: And has antlers on her head.

02:05:20.174 --> 02:05:21.475
ORION: I think we should all leave.

02:05:21.475 --> 02:05:22.769
MARISHA: I like my antlers.

02:05:22.769 --> 02:05:24.017
TALIESIN: I like your antlers.

02:05:24.017 --> 02:05:25.468
MARISHA: What's wrong with my antlers?

02:05:25.468 --> 02:05:27.671
TALIESIN: There's nothing. It's just a very
reasonable reason not to take you too seriously.

02:05:27.671 --> 02:05:28.614
ORION: Scanlan?

02:05:28.614 --> 02:05:30.408
SAM: Yes? Yes, Tiberius, my good friend?

02:05:30.408 --> 02:05:35.666
ORION: Are you satisfied in your knowledge you've
procured?

02:05:35.666 --> 02:05:37.177
SAM: I'm always satisfied.

02:05:37.177 --> 02:05:40.817
(laughter)

02:05:40.817 --> 02:05:42.196
ORION: Wonderful!

02:05:42.196 --> 02:05:43.591
TRAVIS: Too easy. Too easy!

02:05:43.591 --> 02:05:50.814
ORION: Grog, I'm sure you would like to... go to a
pub of sorts?

02:05:50.814 --> 02:05:52.402
LAURA and MARISHA: We're in a pub!

02:05:52.402 --> 02:05:53.452
ORION: Oh, fuck!

02:05:53.452 --> 02:05:54.707
MARISHA: We're day drunk!

02:05:54.707 --> 02:05:56.061
SAM: That's how drunk we are!

02:05:56.061 --> 02:05:57.354
ORION: Shit!

02:05:57.354 --> 02:06:00.319
TALIESIN: I have a brilliant, if slightly
inebriated, thought.

02:06:00.319 --> 02:06:01.771
ORION: I walk out of the bar.

02:06:01.771 --> 02:06:03.030
MATT: Okay.

02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:05.941
TALIESIN: I have an even better brilliant, yet slightly
inebriated thought.

02:06:05.941 --> 02:06:08.474
SAM: Oh, I think I saw Tiberius fall over.

02:06:08.512 --> 02:06:11.944
MARISHA: Oh, is Tiberius puking? Oh...

02:06:11.944 --> 02:06:13.788
LAURA: What is it, Percy?

02:06:13.788 --> 02:06:22.499
TALIESIN: My thought is I can probably find some
of the ore I need to procure at the same time that

02:06:22.499 --> 02:06:27.326
we find this Groon fellow, and at the very least,
you can strike up a quick conversation with him.

02:06:27.326 --> 02:06:31.203
LAURA: Would you like me to go with you, Grog, as
your manager?

02:06:31.203 --> 02:06:33.929
TRAVIS: I would actually like both the twins to go
with.

02:06:33.929 --> 02:06:36.390
SAM: Grog, would you like any young boys to
accompany you?

02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:38.307
(laughter)

02:06:38.307 --> 02:06:41.400
TALIESIN: You can give them a medal!

02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:43.166
TRAVIS: No.

02:06:43.166 --> 02:06:45.602
ORION: I went back into the bar because I went to
take a piss outside.

02:06:45.602 --> 02:06:48.413
LAURA: Let's go!

02:06:48.413 --> 02:06:50.130
MARISHA: Wait, where're we going?

02:06:50.130 --> 02:06:51.073
ORION: What is going on?

02:06:51.073 --> 02:06:53.187
LAURA: You guys are recovering from your drink.

02:06:53.187 --> 02:06:54.413
ORION: Hold on a second.

02:06:54.413 --> 02:06:55.319
MARISHA: No!

02:06:55.319 --> 02:06:56.998
ORION: I've had plenty of water.

02:06:56.998 --> 02:06:58.264
TALIESIN: You're already been arrested today.

02:06:58.264 --> 02:07:02.471
ORION: I'm fine! (slurred) Scanlan has been
ordering me water for the whole time

02:07:02.471 --> 02:07:03.994
has been cleared.

02:07:03.994 --> 02:07:07.590
MARISHA: That's right! I have already been
arrested today, but I did get better.

02:07:07.590 --> 02:07:15.563
MATT: All right, so you guys are going with Percy
to procure materials for forging new ammunition?

02:07:15.563 --> 02:07:17.012
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:07:17.012 --> 02:07:19.111
MATT: All right, go ahead and make an
investigation check.

02:07:19.111 --> 02:07:24.694
TALIESIN: What happened to my dice? Okay. 14.

02:07:24.694 --> 02:07:31.473
MATT: 14, okay. It takes you roughly 30 minutes or
so. Thankfully, this region itself contains...

02:07:31.473 --> 02:07:36.577
honestly, most of the smithing-based materials
and/or workshops they required. The difficult part

02:07:36.577 --> 02:07:45.485
is finding black powder. It is not refined in this
region. It's usually considered almost a byproduct

02:07:45.485 --> 02:07:52.203
of some of the mining and smelting, and it's very
rare to find. Eventually, you find one smithy that

02:07:52.203 --> 02:07:57.808
gathers it. You're not entirely certain why. And
after you give people a couple of examples of the

02:07:57.808 --> 02:08:01.439
smell of it and what to look for, people send you
in this one direction. And you're sent to this one

02:08:01.439 --> 02:08:06.580
small hovel that is attached to the very base of
the mountain that overlooks the entirety of the

02:08:06.580 --> 02:08:13.089
city, on the far northwestern edge of the Braving
Grounds. You come to the door, and it's a very

02:08:13.089 --> 02:08:18.366
simple, slovenly-kept house. The wood itself is a
little warped from the weather; it hasn't kept

02:08:18.366 --> 02:08:24.297
well, and there's a musty smell of mildew from the
outside of the building. But you see a slight glow

02:08:24.297 --> 02:08:27.224
between the cracks. Apparently, there is some sort
of interior light.

02:08:27.224 --> 02:08:30.789
TALIESIN: Hello?

02:08:30.789 --> 02:08:32.147
MATT: "Yes?"

02:08:32.147 --> 02:08:40.593
TALIESIN: Charming. My name is Percival
Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski De Rolo III.

02:08:40.593 --> 02:08:41.972
SAM: Huzzah!

02:08:41.972 --> 02:08:48.921
TALIESIN: Thank you. I was sent here in terms to
hopefully negotiate the purchase of some black

02:08:48.921 --> 02:08:50.424
powder? I heard--

02:08:50.424 --> 02:08:54.028
MATT: The door slams open at this point,
mid-sentence, and you see from around the corner a

02:08:54.028 --> 02:09:02.083
very lithe, crooked-looking man. Quite elderly,
but very spry for his size. You see his arms and

02:09:02.136 --> 02:09:06.809
legs are very lanky and almost spider-like in the
way they move and shift as he peeks out. And you

02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:10.624
can see he has spectacles of two different sizes
and thicknesses around each eye. His hair is

02:09:10.624 --> 02:09:15.197
frazzled and gray and white, and he goes, "Yes?!
You said you need black powder? Yes, yes, come in,

02:09:15.197 --> 02:09:17.672
"come in!" And he runs back into the hovel.

02:09:17.672 --> 02:09:19.773
TALIESIN: I gingerly enter.

02:09:19.773 --> 02:09:26.603
MATT: As you step inside, the scent hits you
immediately, and you realize this place is

02:09:26.603 --> 02:09:31.385
probably filled with black powder. And the last
thing anyone wants is to set off any sort of

02:09:31.385 --> 02:09:35.393
flame. This would be a very bad idea. And as you
look around, your eyes adjust to the low-lit

02:09:35.393 --> 02:09:43.591
interior. You realize it's low-lit because there
are two very, very faintly set magical torch

02:09:43.591 --> 02:09:46.187
sconces on each side that are very, very low
light.

02:09:46.187 --> 02:09:48.780
LAURA: Very similar to the ones surrounding you.

02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:52.970
MATT: Kind of like these, but even smaller! And
you can see in the room, there is a small forge

02:09:52.970 --> 02:09:54.551
that's in disuse to the far end.

02:09:54.551 --> 02:09:56.175
TALIESIN: I would hope so!

02:09:56.175 --> 02:10:02.436
MATT: There are a large, large, &lt;i&gt;large&lt;/i&gt; number of
crates and barrels that all seem to be containing

02:10:02.436 --> 02:10:09.551
various parts of discarded gravel. Basically,
whatever is shoved off of any mining expedition

02:10:09.551 --> 02:10:15.069
goes to him and he just shuffles through it and
separates in different pieces. And there's barrels

02:10:15.069 --> 02:10:23.233
full of sulfur, barrels full of what looks like
broken onyx or broken quartz, and they've all been

02:10:23.233 --> 02:10:27.581
separated. And you can see now this is his OCD
collection. And there is, indeed, at the far end

02:10:27.581 --> 02:10:33.823
what looks to be a barrel that contains a large
amount of black powder that is just everywhere.

02:10:33.823 --> 02:10:38.260
It's like this very fine coat of powder that is
encompassing this entire room. And as he turns

02:10:38.260 --> 02:10:42.710
around, you can see now his hands themselves are
black and coated in it. And he goes, "So! You came

02:10:42.710 --> 02:10:47.869
"looking for black powder, did you? No one asks
about the black powder, but I knew it had a

02:10:47.869 --> 02:10:51.432
"purpose! Yes! You wish to buy it?! How much do you
want?"

02:10:51.432 --> 02:10:55.095
(giggling)

02:10:55.095 --> 02:10:57.379
MATT: (pants heavily) "Speak up! Speak up, I
haven't all day!"

02:10:57.379 --> 02:11:00.971
TALIESIN: How much for a barrel or a hogshead's
worth?

02:11:00.971 --> 02:11:13.490
MATT: "For the barrel? The barrel, that'll run
you... (mutters) 4,623 gold pieces for the barrel.

02:11:13.490 --> 02:11:18.175
"However, for the hogshead--" You can see now the
spittle dribbling down his chin.

02:11:18.175 --> 02:11:20.663
TALIESIN: I can! It's as if I can see the spittle
myself!

02:11:20.663 --> 02:11:26.379
MATT: Yes, indeed! "But! For the hogshead, which--
ooh!" And he turns around and shuffles through a

02:11:26.379 --> 02:11:30.337
bunch of pieces of burlap and sacks and pulls out
what looks to be an actual dried and hollowed-out

02:11:30.379 --> 02:11:38.472
hog's head. "To fill this? To fill this hog's head
with it? This'll only cost you 426 gold pieces.

02:11:38.472 --> 02:11:40.868
"Yes?"

02:11:40.868 --> 02:11:46.960
TALIESIN: How about 400 even, and you can direct
me to some ore, as well?

02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:50.534
MATT: "Ore? I do not work in ore."

02:11:50.534 --> 02:11:53.824
TALIESIN: I thought you might have a friend.

02:11:53.824 --> 02:11:55.177
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

02:11:55.177 --> 02:11:56.482
TRAVIS: Nice, Percy.

02:11:56.482 --> 02:11:58.694
LIAM: Look at that, he slipped right into Mercer
there.

02:11:58.694 --> 02:12:00.344
SAM: No, that's the other character.

02:12:00.344 --> 02:12:03.228
TALIESIN: I love Percy. 25.

02:12:03.228 --> 02:12:04.639
MATT: 25.

02:12:04.639 --> 02:12:08.112
TALIESIN: I'm sure you have a friend. You must.
You seem so amiable.

02:12:08.112 --> 02:12:13.661
MATT: "400! 400 and I send you to Samson! Yes? You
take?"

02:12:13.661 --> 02:12:15.766
TALIESIN: My good sir, you have a deal!

02:12:15.766 --> 02:12:20.398
MATT: "Glorious!" He turns around and jams the hog
head into the barrel of black powder, picks it up.

02:12:20.398 --> 02:12:25.202
(poof) The soot settles against you and the rest
of you guys as you now find yourself partially

02:12:25.202 --> 02:12:30.395
covered in this slowly dissipating cloud of black
powder. (coughs) You cough instinctively and

02:12:30.431 --> 02:12:33.262
push it away. "Yes. 400 gold. You pay?"

02:12:33.298 --> 02:12:37.680
TALIESIN: I gingerly put the purse down in front
of me.

02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:41.828
MATT: He takes it. With a whisk, it's already put
away into a side pouch, and you hear the clanging

02:12:41.828 --> 02:12:49.265
of haphazard coins in his far pocket. "Here! Hog
head! Take it! (grunts) To Samson! This way!" And

02:12:49.265 --> 02:12:54.237
he grabs your arm and drags you out of his hovel.
He points across the way with his shaking, crooked

02:12:54.237 --> 02:13:02.446
finger. "Samson! There! In the brick building!
Tell him Victor sent you. He'll give you ore!"

02:13:02.446 --> 02:13:06.665
TALIESIN: Thank you for all of your help. You've
been so kind.

02:13:06.665 --> 02:13:11.451
MATT: "My pleasure. You want more powder, come
back. Yes, yes?!"

02:13:11.451 --> 02:13:13.044
TALIESIN: I might do that.

02:13:13.044 --> 02:13:17.462
MATT: "Good! Goodbye!" And pushes you out, takes
both of you by the arms and pushes you out, slams

02:13:17.462 --> 02:13:21.783
the door behind, and you are left standing there,
half-covered in blackened soot and black powder,

02:13:21.783 --> 02:13:25.169
in the center of the thoroughfare, midday, stunned
by the whole encounter.

02:13:25.169 --> 02:13:27.765
TRAVIS: I mean, come on, come the fuck on!

02:13:27.765 --> 02:13:30.790
SAM: Amazing. Matt's crazy prospector character.

02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:37.078
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk over to Samson's place
and become very excited at the

02:13:37.078 --> 02:13:39.092
prospect of a new accent.

02:13:39.092 --> 02:13:43.173
LIAM: 6.2, 6.4, 6.5.

02:13:43.173 --> 02:13:45.418
TALIESIN: 4.3 from the Russian judge.

02:13:45.418 --> 02:13:52.315
MATT: Yeah, you walk to the distant brick
building. The bricks themselves are made of a

02:13:52.315 --> 02:13:58.608
hardened, grayish clay material that's been made
in the basic construction of this. The roof itself

02:13:58.608 --> 02:14:04.040
is a solid slab of stone. There is no pretty or
elegant aspect of its construction. It's merely

02:14:04.040 --> 02:14:09.219
built here for purpose. The door is partially
ajar, and as you peek in you can see there is a

02:14:09.219 --> 02:14:15.191
very active forge. There is a heat emanating from
the interior, and you can see there is a man who

02:14:15.191 --> 02:14:19.093
is currently hammering something away at what
looks like an anvil set outside in front of it.

02:14:19.093 --> 02:14:22.851
(metal clanging)

02:14:22.890 --> 02:14:25.303
"Yes?"

02:14:25.303 --> 02:14:27.893
TALIESIN: Mr. Samson?

02:14:27.893 --> 02:14:29.211
MATT: "Yes?"

02:14:29.211 --> 02:14:35.555
TALIESIN: The strange fellow down the road sent me
to you. He said you might have some ore?

02:14:35.555 --> 02:14:41.452
MATT: (heavy sigh) The head sinks into the
shoulders with a sigh. "All right. If you dealt

02:14:41.452 --> 02:14:45.954
"with that crazy old coot, at the very least I can
offer you a brief conversation. Hold on just a

02:14:45.954 --> 02:14:50.372
"second!" (grunts) And you see he takes this visor
off the front of his face and sets it down and

02:14:50.372 --> 02:14:57.855
removes these big leather gloves and this leather
apron of sorts and puts it to the side, and he

02:14:57.855 --> 02:15:01.694
wipes his brow as he steps over. And you can see
him now. He's a man in his late twenties.

02:15:01.694 --> 02:15:07.381
Muscle-bound, a little thick around the waist,
barrel-chested. A little bit of scruff on his

02:15:07.381 --> 02:15:15.732
chin, but nothing beyond not having time for
upkeep and focused on his work. He steps up. "So

02:15:15.732 --> 02:15:17.490
"what did the old coot tell you, anyway?"

02:15:17.490 --> 02:15:21.725
TALIESIN: He said you might have some raw ore for
sale that I might purchase. You'll excuse me if I

02:15:21.725 --> 02:15:24.005
don't come in; I'm covered in explosive powder.

02:15:24.005 --> 02:15:29.937
MATT: "No, please. Stay there. For the love of
Kord, stay on that doorstep. Do not step into my

02:15:29.937 --> 02:15:31.272
"abode, please."

02:15:31.272 --> 02:15:32.556
TALIESIN: Of course.

02:15:32.556 --> 02:15:33.450
MATT: "Please."

02:15:33.450 --> 02:15:34.958
TALIESIN: No. Yes.

02:15:34.958 --> 02:15:39.082
MATT: "Please. All right. What ore are you
interested in?"

02:15:39.082 --> 02:15:43.585
TALIESIN: Just some iron ore. Actually, I have a
little invention which sends projectiles

02:15:43.585 --> 02:15:44.699
at great speed.

02:15:44.699 --> 02:15:50.802
MATT: "That sounds fascinating. I have ore for
sale. Raw ore-- would you like ingots? I prepare

02:15:50.802 --> 02:15:54.620
"ingots. They're a little more expensive, but
they're proper and ready for any sort of use as

02:15:54.620 --> 02:15:55.941
"blacksmithing materials."

02:15:55.941 --> 02:15:57.900
TALIESIN: Ingots would be preferable, yes.

02:15:57.900 --> 02:15:59.992
MATT: "All right, how many are you looking for?
Five, ten, 20?"

02:15:59.992 --> 02:16:03.523
TALIESIN: What could you give me for approximately
a thousand gold's worth?

02:16:03.523 --> 02:16:12.191
MATT: He gives you an arched eyebrow in surprise.
"I mean, I only have about 200 pounds of iron

02:16:12.191 --> 02:16:13.771
"ingots at the ready."

02:16:13.771 --> 02:16:15.689
TALIESIN: I certainly can't carry that much with
me right now.

02:16:15.689 --> 02:16:17.503
Let's say about a hundred pounds' worth?

02:16:17.503 --> 02:16:23.665
MATT: "A hundred pounds of iron ingots. I could
sell it to you. Let's set the price at about 400

02:16:23.665 --> 02:16:24.565
"gold pieces."

02:16:24.565 --> 02:16:26.763
LAURA: Ugh, haggle him down. I'm not there.

02:16:26.763 --> 02:16:33.134
LIAM: But in the back of his head, he hears
your voice. We all do, at this point.

02:16:33.311 --> 02:16:41.483
TALIESIN: Let's say 350 gold, and I promise to
always shower twice before entering your home for

02:16:41.483 --> 02:16:43.123
my next purchase.

02:16:43.123 --> 02:16:45.161
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

02:16:45.161 --> 02:16:46.543
TALIESIN: All right.

02:16:46.543 --> 02:16:50.386
SAM: Pointless haggle. I love it. Best part of
the show.

02:16:50.386 --> 02:16:52.235
MARISHA: I wish I were Percy.

02:16:52.235 --> 02:16:53.350
TALIESIN: 24.

02:16:53.350 --> 02:17:03.478
MATT: 24? He goes, "You drive a hard bargain.
However, underneath all that soot, I can see you

02:17:03.478 --> 02:17:09.008
"dress well, at the very least. A bit tattered
around the edges... I'd like future business, so

02:17:09.008 --> 02:17:14.416
"350 and take the ingots, and please do shower next
time."

02:17:14.416 --> 02:17:20.752
TALIESIN: Of course. You are a gentleman, and
apparently a worthy smith, as well. I do bid you

02:17:20.752 --> 02:17:21.990
good day, then.

02:17:21.990 --> 02:17:26.607
MATT: "I've already completed the transaction.
Flattery is not required." He reaches over and

02:17:26.607 --> 02:17:32.088
settles into a large, triple-bagged sack of
ingots. He gets partway through and goes, "Nah,

02:17:32.088 --> 02:17:37.811
"this is cart-worthy." He sets it up on a small
cart and brings it over to you. And it's a small,

02:17:37.811 --> 02:17:43.351
wheeled wooden cart. It looks really rickety and
probably about to collapse, but he does not charge

02:17:43.351 --> 02:17:46.430
you for it. It can be hand-carried if need be.

02:17:46.430 --> 02:17:49.653
TALIESIN: Good man, I will see you when my need
arises again.

02:17:49.653 --> 02:17:52.233
MATT: "I look forward to it. Remember: bathed!"

02:17:52.275 --> 02:17:55.403
TALIESIN: Very bathed. In fact, quite bathed.

02:17:55.403 --> 02:18:05.740
MATT: "Seriously. Bathed. Please. All right, we're
good. Thank you." And he closes the door. All

02:18:05.740 --> 02:18:08.948
right. You guys?

02:18:08.948 --> 02:18:11.214
TRAVIS: We're going to see Earthbreaker...

02:18:11.214 --> 02:18:12.763
SAM and LAURA: Earthbreaker Groon!

02:18:12.763 --> 02:18:15.452
MATT: All right. Make your way to the outskirts of
the Trial Forge.

02:18:15.452 --> 02:18:17.553
ORION: We know who he is. Do we need to pursue
this guy?

02:18:17.553 --> 02:18:19.147
LAURA: Just to talk to him, because he likes
Grog.

02:18:19.147 --> 02:18:21.508
MARISHA: I mean, we can stay and keep getting
day-drunk.

02:18:21.508 --> 02:18:23.898
SAM: Why don't you just go get arrested again?

02:18:23.898 --> 02:18:27.812
MARISHA: Hey, that hurts, Scanlan.

02:18:27.812 --> 02:18:30.784
TALIESIN: I'm going to come back and join you.

02:18:30.784 --> 02:18:36.571
ORION: I'm going to do a daily roll for my pet
because I'm going to try to teach a trick, and I

02:18:36.571 --> 02:18:37.682
rolled a 15.

02:18:37.682 --> 02:18:39.904
MATT: Okay. Trying to teach it a trick?

02:18:39.904 --> 02:18:46.740
ORION: Yeah. At the end of the-- does it just
build up points today and then try...

02:18:46.740 --> 02:18:48.328
MATT: What kind of trick are you teaching?

02:18:48.328 --> 02:18:50.250
ORION: To scout!

02:18:50.250 --> 02:18:54.962
MATT: To scout for you? I'd say with a 15, yeah.
You take some time, and with a small Draconian

02:18:54.962 --> 02:18:59.938
command, a phrase of your choice, you teach it
that on that one phrase, it will go ahead and

02:18:59.938 --> 02:19:08.549
wander ahead for a bit and then come back and
relinquish in very broken, very basic Draconic

02:19:08.549 --> 02:19:13.906
language into your connection with it. Very, very
basic information on what it saw.

02:19:13.906 --> 02:19:14.866
ORION: Cool.

02:19:14.866 --> 02:19:17.776
SAM: I'm going to throw a Lightning Bolt spell
into my Ioun Stone.

02:19:17.776 --> 02:19:19.774
MATT: Okay, so you store that. Awesome.

02:19:19.774 --> 02:19:21.009
ORION: Little treat.

02:19:21.009 --> 02:19:25.565
MATT: It takes it and gobbles it down happily.
Awesome. You guys make your way to the Trial

02:19:25.565 --> 02:19:30.643
Forge, the large temple to Kord itself. It's once
again brilliant to behold. There are steps leading

02:19:30.643 --> 02:19:35.601
up to the front area: these giant reddish, almost
rusted-over looking iron doors that block the

02:19:35.601 --> 02:19:39.743
front entrance. At the very top of it, you see
looming over this entire district is a gargantuan

02:19:39.743 --> 02:19:45.478
statue of Kord himself. This giant, muscle-bound
humanoid titan of a figure, that stands there:

02:19:45.478 --> 02:19:52.688
giant beard, muscle-bound torso, bracers against
the arms, just one knee up. This very heroic pose

02:19:52.688 --> 02:19:59.076
and just looking over the rest of Vasselheim under
his gaze. You see at the front of these iron

02:19:59.076 --> 02:20:03.459
doors, there are two more Bastions adorned in the
same way as the ones that oversaw the battle at the

02:20:03.518 --> 02:20:11.507
Crucible. One shouts out, "Halt! Ye who approacheth
the Trial Forge, what is your business here?"

02:20:11.566 --> 02:20:19.287
LAURA: Yes, we are here to pay homage to
Earthbreaker Groon with the latest

02:20:19.287 --> 02:20:21.571
champion of the city.

02:20:21.571 --> 02:20:25.482
MATT: "Of the city? The city claims no champion!"

02:20:25.482 --> 02:20:28.672
LAURA: Of the Crucible. You know.

02:20:28.672 --> 02:20:30.675
MATT: They glance at each other.

02:20:30.675 --> 02:20:32.156
LIAM: The Earthbreaker is a fan.

02:20:32.156 --> 02:20:37.764
MATT: (chuckles) "I highly doubt that."

02:20:37.764 --> 02:20:39.027
ORION: Tell him it's Grog's--

02:20:39.027 --> 02:20:42.352
MARISHA: We're not there.

02:20:42.352 --> 02:20:47.763
LIAM: Check your facts, buddy. He likes the cut of
his jib, believe you me.

02:20:47.763 --> 02:20:56.146
MATT: And the other one gets up to his side and
stands there, arms crossed, looking down upon you

02:20:56.146 --> 02:21:01.541
from three large stone steps up with this look of,
"I'm looking forward to throwing these guys out."

02:21:01.541 --> 02:21:10.978
About five minutes pass and the next one comes
back and whispers in his ear... "Very well. The

02:21:10.978 --> 02:21:19.514
"four of you may enter briefly. But this one's only
invited to the center chamber. The rest of you

02:21:19.514 --> 02:21:24.131
"must keep a distance. A distance."

02:21:24.131 --> 02:21:28.098
LAURA: Oh, yeah, like what? Ten feet? Yeah?

02:21:28.098 --> 02:21:35.138
MATT: "You'll know." He steps aside and the doors
(stone scraping) slide open. As you guys step into

02:21:35.138 --> 02:21:40.542
the interior, the smell that hits you immediately
is that of sage and other burned herbs that are

02:21:40.542 --> 02:21:48.865
used ceremonially to cleanse a certain landscape
of evil spirits, from a superstitious standpoint, but

02:21:48.918 --> 02:21:58.161
also to build an atmosphere of meditation and
understanding. The one Bastion that left and came

02:21:58.161 --> 02:22:01.647
back and whispered in his ear comes up and leans
into you guys and gives you a nod. He doesn't

02:22:01.647 --> 02:22:05.459
actually speak to you, but he gives you a
hand gesture to follow. Leads you into the Trial

02:22:05.502 --> 02:22:11.882
Forge and you can see now, these halls are
essentially one long hallway. It's an arch about

02:22:11.882 --> 02:22:20.256
85 to 100 feet up. And the interior of it is built
out of a very thick, sturdy reddish stone. You

02:22:20.256 --> 02:22:24.206
don't know if the actual stone itself is built
from a substance of this color, or itself has been

02:22:24.206 --> 02:22:29.465
stained or colored to match the rest of the Kord
reddish aesthetic. But as you step in, your

02:22:29.465 --> 02:22:36.113
footfalls clack against a black marble floor with
what looks like gold streaks through it, almost

02:22:36.113 --> 02:22:40.409
like there are small veins of some sort of gold
material that has been polished within the actual

02:22:40.409 --> 02:22:41.562
marble itself.

02:22:41.562 --> 02:22:42.824
LAURA: Very pretty.

02:22:42.824 --> 02:22:47.508
MATT: Gives you a nod and a smile. No words in
response. Continues to gesture forth, and as you

02:22:47.508 --> 02:22:52.207
guys step in, you see occasionally a few other
individuals walking by with a similar gold and red

02:22:52.207 --> 02:22:58.871
robe aesthetic that you saw Earthbreaker wearing
when he went to watch your battle in the Crucible.

02:22:58.871 --> 02:23:06.415
However, they are generally a little more dressed
down, very simple, as opposed the expressive

02:23:06.415 --> 02:23:12.651
designs that were billowing across the baggy
leggings that the Earthbreaker was wearing. And

02:23:12.707 --> 02:23:18.913
the robes. As you continue forward, they all step
aside and keep a quiet watch, until you begin to

02:23:18.966 --> 02:23:23.837
notice in the distance, there are two large
hallways that intersect. You can see most of the

02:23:23.837 --> 02:23:30.722
Trial Forge are now two long hallways that
intersect into a center piece. And the center

02:23:30.722 --> 02:23:36.778
place of this temple, there is a raised dais at
three different levels. And at the top of it, you

02:23:36.778 --> 02:23:43.262
can see, there is a beam of light that comes down
from above. As you begin to walk towards the

02:23:43.262 --> 02:23:50.622
structure, you see there is a small figure that is
currently sitting on top of this central dais. As

02:23:50.622 --> 02:23:56.029
you approach the outskirts of this main central
chamber where the two long hallways intersect, the

02:23:56.029 --> 02:23:59.691
quiet Bastion puts his hand out and tells the rest
of you to stop.

02:23:59.691 --> 02:24:02.195
Gives you a look and nudges you to proceed.

02:24:02.195 --> 02:24:05.362
SAM: Do you need us with you?

02:24:05.362 --> 02:24:07.829
TRAVIS: What? Yeah, you know I don't like
talking.

02:24:07.829 --> 02:24:14.027
LAURA: (whispering) He's not very good at talking.
Would you like someone to come and

02:24:14.027 --> 02:24:15.422
translate for him?

02:24:15.422 --> 02:24:17.049
LIAM: Is he going on his own, then?

02:24:17.049 --> 02:24:21.327
LAURA: Is that a yes?

02:24:21.327 --> 02:24:23.010
SAM: Good luck.

02:24:23.010 --> 02:24:24.107
LAURA: Okay, sorry.

02:24:24.107 --> 02:24:25.624
TRAVIS: I go forward.

02:24:25.624 --> 02:24:28.988
MATT: As you step forward, footfalls clacking
against the material--

02:24:28.988 --> 02:24:36.529
LIAM: I'm sorry, we've been daytime drinking, and
I hate to interrupt that, do you have a place here

02:24:36.529 --> 02:24:37.565
if I can't--

02:24:37.565 --> 02:24:39.531
SAM: I don't think they-- This is a temple.

02:24:39.531 --> 02:24:40.910
LAURA: Yeah this really not the kind of--

02:24:40.910 --> 02:24:41.931
LIAM: Are you sure?

02:24:41.931 --> 02:24:42.825
LAURA: Yeah.

02:24:42.825 --> 02:24:44.373
MATT: Puts his hand out.

02:24:44.373 --> 02:24:45.708
LAURA: They don't like talking.

02:24:45.708 --> 02:24:50.470
SAM: Oh he has some sort of vow of silence. We
should respect it and also make fun of it when

02:24:50.470 --> 02:24:51.670
he's gone.

02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:56.122
LIAM: Is that the end of that? It's fine.
(whispering) I've got a flask.

02:24:56.122 --> 02:25:02.243
MATT: As Grog steps out in the central chamber,
you can hear his footfalls echoing throughout the

02:25:02.243 --> 02:25:09.149
site, and as you look up, you can see now the
light source from above, there is what looks like

02:25:09.149 --> 02:25:14.120
a stained-glass domed roof to the top of the
central chamber. There is a dark spot in the

02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:20.008
center, where you can see the shadow from the
early afternoon sun is being blocked from the

02:25:20.008 --> 02:25:24.693
giant statue of Kord that remains at the top of
this temple, who is currently, essentially, now

02:25:24.693 --> 02:25:31.197
looking at the structure, straddling the top of
this giant domed stained glass roof, and so

02:25:31.197 --> 02:25:36.602
underneath this statue is where the top of this
structure is, and through it, these beams of light

02:25:36.602 --> 02:25:42.223
are coming down, multicolored and cascading onto
this central chamber. Sitting in the center, you

02:25:42.223 --> 02:25:48.859
see, cross-legged, arms to the side, eyes closed,
there sits Earthbreaker Groon, the Dawn Marshal

02:25:48.859 --> 02:25:51.198
himself. Quiet, as you approach.

02:25:51.198 --> 02:25:52.303
TRAVIS: Eyes closed?

02:25:52.303 --> 02:25:53.688
MATT: Eyes closed.

02:25:53.688 --> 02:26:06.278
TRAVIS: I step forward and say: (coughs) Sorry to
disturb, I'm looking for Earthbreaker Groon.

02:26:06.278 --> 02:26:13.041
MATT: You see an eyebrow twitch for a second. Eyes
remain closed, and the head turns for a second.

02:26:13.041 --> 02:26:20.529
Hands come together like this, and in that one
motion stands to his feet, almost like it was

02:26:20.529 --> 02:26:23.752
effortless, from what would seem like a very
uncomfortable position, suddenly is fully standing

02:26:23.752 --> 02:26:31.568
with a swift movement. In place, rotates and turns
towards you, eyes still closed, at which point the

02:26:31.568 --> 02:26:35.959
eyes open-- and you saw pupils previously, but in
this moment of what seems to be serious

02:26:35.959 --> 02:26:43.194
meditation, there is this luminescent white light
that encompasses the entirety of each eye, just

02:26:43.194 --> 02:26:46.536
looking straight towards you, the hands still
clasped in the center.

02:26:46.536 --> 02:26:48.056
They're staring straight at you.

02:26:48.056 --> 02:26:49.399
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:26:49.399 --> 02:26:59.059
MATT: "You have found the Earthbreaker. What do
you ask of me?"

02:26:59.059 --> 02:27:07.247
TRAVIS: I keep the little bit of pee that's about
to fall out from falling out, and I say: I

02:27:07.247 --> 02:27:14.369
happened to see you amongst the crowd at my recent
tussle. It seemed that everyone there seemed to

02:27:14.369 --> 02:27:19.467
know who you were. I wanted to at least introduce
myself.

02:27:19.467 --> 02:27:24.074
MATT: "You are Grog the Victorious."

02:27:24.074 --> 02:27:26.744
TRAVIS: That's right! (coughs) That's right.

02:27:26.744 --> 02:27:37.654
MATT: "Once called Philip. Known as one of Vox
Machina, the travelling band from Emon. Slayer of

02:27:37.654 --> 02:27:54.223
"demons that once usurped Uriel himself. I know of
your travels. I know of your deeds. What else do

02:27:54.223 --> 02:27:57.999
"you ask of the Earthbreaker?"

02:27:57.999 --> 02:28:12.129
TRAVIS: I don't really ask. I only mean to say
that Vox Machina is at your disposal, if you would

02:28:12.129 --> 02:28:26.886
ever need someone outside of the amazing Braving
Grounds, Vasselheim. We're really amazing.

02:28:26.886 --> 02:28:30.216
ORION: We know where they're at, right?

02:28:30.216 --> 02:28:31.158
MARISHA: No.

02:28:31.158 --> 02:28:32.369
ORION: We don't know where they're at?

02:28:32.369 --> 02:28:34.258
TRAVIS: If you would just keep us in mind.

02:28:34.258 --> 02:28:41.344
MATT: At this point in time, his eyelids close,
and they open again, and there's a softness that

02:28:41.344 --> 02:28:46.930
there wasn't before. The white light has faded,
and you can now see beneath them these extremely

02:28:46.930 --> 02:28:55.109
piercing very, very light blue, almost white
irises that surround his pupils. And from his old,

02:28:55.109 --> 02:29:01.604
weathered, wrinkled face from underneath his
beard, you can see a smile slowly crawl across

02:29:01.642 --> 02:29:08.902
his cheeks. His hands release and rest to his
side. He lifts his head slightly as if to look

02:29:08.902 --> 02:29:17.518
down at you from upon this dais, not with
judgment, but with curiosity. His voice echoes and

02:29:17.518 --> 02:29:25.914
booms through this with even but a whisper from
his throat, once again saying, "Your piety is

02:29:25.914 --> 02:29:36.453
"accepted. Perhaps there may be a use for Kord of
you and your compatriots in the future. Should

02:29:36.453 --> 02:29:47.767
"this day arise, you will know, and you must hurry.
Dark times are ahead. I can see the veils

02:29:47.767 --> 02:30:00.228
"twisting. Many, many evil minds come to rend the
peace apart. There will be a day I call for you,

02:30:00.228 --> 02:30:06.278
"Grog the Victorious. Stay alive."

02:30:06.278 --> 02:30:14.132
TRAVIS: I mean to. Thank you. It has been an honor
being in your presence.

02:30:14.262 --> 02:30:21.953
MATT: He steps back to his position originally.
"Now go." He turns around and sits back into his

02:30:21.953 --> 02:30:27.136
meditate position and closes his eyes and
disappears back into the same place where you

02:30:27.136 --> 02:30:28.611
originally saw him.

02:30:28.611 --> 02:30:32.324
TRAVIS: I turn around and I go: Guys, his fucking
eyes are glowing.

02:30:32.324 --> 02:30:34.270
LIAM: (whispers) We're not here.

02:30:34.270 --> 02:30:35.551
LAURA: (whispers) You've got to go.

02:30:35.551 --> 02:30:37.221
SAM: You kept it together great!

02:30:37.221 --> 02:30:38.558
TRAVIS: Thanks. Did you hear all of that?

02:30:38.558 --> 02:30:40.309
SAM: Yeah, I couldn't hear much, but it was
great.

02:30:40.309 --> 02:30:42.145
TRAVIS: I almost had an aneurysm.

02:30:42.145 --> 02:30:44.129
LIAM: He sounded very serious.

02:30:44.129 --> 02:30:46.690
TRAVIS: Yeah we should go. He's cool.

02:30:46.690 --> 02:30:48.068
SAM: Do you think I should shit somewhere--

02:30:48.068 --> 02:30:49.769
LAURA: No. Just go.

02:30:49.769 --> 02:30:51.165
SAM: Okay, we'll just go, then.

02:30:51.165 --> 02:30:52.771
TRAVIS: Yeah, sans shit. And we're out.

02:30:52.771 --> 02:30:53.778
LIAM: Better be safe.

02:30:53.778 --> 02:30:55.372
SAM: Better be safe?

02:30:55.372 --> 02:30:56.575
LIAM: Just a little one.

02:30:56.575 --> 02:30:57.843
LAURA and TRAVIS: No.

02:30:57.843 --> 02:30:59.239
SAM: No? Okay, we'll just go.

02:30:59.239 --> 02:31:04.684
TRAVIS: And we make our way out of the
golden-floored, glowing-eyed guy's house.

02:31:04.684 --> 02:31:07.806
MATT: You are escorted out of the Trial Forge. You
eventually meet up with the rest of Vox Machina.

02:31:07.806 --> 02:31:14.897
You carrying to your side, strapped, a dried
hogshead filled with black powder and a cart of

02:31:14.897 --> 02:31:18.167
about 100 pounds of iron ingots.

02:31:18.167 --> 02:31:20.830
TRAVIS: Ooh! You want me to hold onto all that for
you?

02:31:20.830 --> 02:31:25.013
TALIESIN: Actually, if you could just help load it
onto the ship, that would be lovely.

02:31:25.013 --> 02:31:26.337
SAM: Are we going on the airship?

02:31:26.337 --> 02:31:28.504
ORION: If we could fit it in the Bag of Holding,
it would be much better.

02:31:28.504 --> 02:31:32.911
TALIESIN: Sure. Certainly, if we can put it in the
Bag of Holding, that would be fine.

02:31:32.911 --> 02:31:34.358
LAURA: Is that a pig's head?

02:31:34.358 --> 02:31:35.688
MARISHA: It is literally a pig's head.

02:31:35.688 --> 02:31:40.180
TALIESIN: I... Yes, that is in fact a pig's head.
It's complicated.

02:31:40.180 --> 02:31:46.925
SAM: Let's find Captain Damon and get back on the
ship.

02:31:46.925 --> 02:31:49.038
ORION: I start casting Circle of Teleportation.

02:31:49.038 --> 02:31:54.242
MATT: As you guys are having this discussion, you
look over and you can see the airship, which is a

02:31:54.242 --> 02:31:58.162
not too hard to see from this distance, is
currently being outfitted, actually being

02:31:58.162 --> 02:32:02.689
finalized, being outfitted with brand new
ballistae. Remember those giant dragon-headed

02:32:02.689 --> 02:32:06.690
ballistae you saw settled on the walls on the
outskirts of Vasselheim? Those have now been

02:32:06.690 --> 02:32:12.442
affixed to the airship, as the previous air
encounter it had, they didn't seem to quite cut

02:32:12.442 --> 02:32:16.949
through the defenses. You guys notice this just in
time, as you see a flash of light and you look

02:32:16.949 --> 02:32:22.775
over your shoulder, and Tiberius has finished
drawing what looks to be a large sigil-- I fixed

02:32:22.775 --> 02:32:24.217
my pronunciation in that, thank you--

02:32:24.217 --> 02:32:26.282
SAM: I like "siggle."

02:32:26.282 --> 02:32:31.628
MATT: I grew up with "siggle," and nevertheless--
I know. Sigil--

02:32:31.628 --> 02:32:38.727
LIAM: Since I came in at the halfway mark, I
really wanted to go to an ink specialist here in

02:32:38.727 --> 02:32:46.703
Vasselheim before we left, so can we retcon and go
backwards and say that I got the elven sounds for

02:32:46.703 --> 02:32:51.855
"vuh" and "mm" put right there?

02:32:51.855 --> 02:32:53.971
LAURA: Tattooed on his fucking wrist.

02:32:53.971 --> 02:33:04.389
LIAM: Elven. And then over here, I don't remember
much of the mathematics, that my teachers in our

02:33:04.389 --> 02:33:05.635
homeland--

02:33:05.635 --> 02:33:12.090
SAM: Wait, are you saying that someone out there
in the world should do the elven symbol for VM and

02:33:12.090 --> 02:33:14.411
we should all get literally tattooed?

02:33:14.411 --> 02:33:20.631
LIAM: No, that's ridiculous. But over here, I have
a mathematical shape. I don't know if you know

02:33:20.631 --> 02:33:26.918
arithmetic, but I learned arithmetic when I was
studying. I learned knife-work, I learned elven

02:33:26.918 --> 02:33:33.943
poetry, and I learned arithmetic and I had a knack
for it. She didn't, but I did. And I would like to

02:33:33.943 --> 02:33:39.457
get a-- it was called an icosahedron-- right
here.

02:33:39.457 --> 02:33:40.931
LAURA: Right here?

02:33:40.931 --> 02:33:42.351
LIAM: Right here.

02:33:42.351 --> 02:33:46.421
MARISHA: Wait, are we all doing that together?

02:33:46.421 --> 02:33:47.604
SAM: In real life?

02:33:47.604 --> 02:33:49.158
MARISHA: I'll go with you.

02:33:49.158 --> 02:33:52.341
LIAM: This is real life. But to start--

02:33:52.341 --> 02:33:56.912
MARISHA: You guys, we got a little day-drunk.
Let's go together. Come on.

02:33:56.912 --> 02:34:02.884
LIAM: Just me, the symbol for "vuh" and "mm" in
Elven right there.

02:34:03.024 --> 02:34:08.849
MATT: All right. So, as you've had this done over
the past few days as you were awaiting the return

02:34:08.849 --> 02:34:14.552
of the other team who went off against a white
dragon, apparently, you've had the time to do so,

02:34:14.552 --> 02:34:16.901
you just haven't quite revealed it to the rest of
your allies yet.

02:34:16.901 --> 02:34:17.851
LIAM: All right.

02:34:17.851 --> 02:34:20.896
MATT: All right. But you guys look over your
shoulder, and as you're talking about taking an

02:34:20.896 --> 02:34:25.100
airship, Tiberius has crafted a runic circle into
the ground that itself is beginning to pulse with

02:34:25.100 --> 02:34:28.653
arcane energy, a familiar "siggle," one that you
think actually--

02:34:28.653 --> 02:34:29.938
LAURA: (whispers) Sigil.

02:34:29.938 --> 02:34:36.902
MATT: Sigil. No, I keep fucking it up. I just
happily fixed it, and then you caught me.

02:34:36.902 --> 02:34:43.385
LIAM: That's pronounced Coke and a cola.

02:34:43.385 --> 02:34:50.121
MATT: There we go. The arcane &lt;i&gt;sigil&lt;/i&gt; on the
ground, a familiar one that you once saw on the

02:34:50.121 --> 02:34:53.142
beach of one Underdark subterranean island.

02:34:53.142 --> 02:34:57.640
MARISHA: Down by the beach, so that we have--

02:34:57.640 --> 02:34:59.459
LAURA: Down over by the bad lands?

02:34:59.459 --> 02:35:03.128
MATT: Tiberius, you are on the cusp of completing
your ritual.

02:35:03.128 --> 02:35:07.531
ORION: Oh, I choose Emon.

02:35:07.531 --> 02:35:14.143
MATT: All right. The sigil flashes with arcane
energy and opens up. You see a small doorway

02:35:14.143 --> 02:35:16.497
that's sparkling across the ground.

02:35:16.497 --> 02:35:17.848
MARISHA: He's just making the sigil.

02:35:17.848 --> 02:35:20.401
LAURA: We can just pop over to Emon.

02:35:20.401 --> 02:35:25.461
MATT: You can see the sigil shimmering as the
energy is beginning to fade.

02:35:25.461 --> 02:35:26.912
TRAVIS: We should go in.

02:35:26.912 --> 02:35:28.127
TALIESIN: Let's go!

02:35:28.127 --> 02:35:30.008
SAM: What about the airship? What about Captain
Damon?

02:35:30.008 --> 02:35:31.771
LAURA: The airship was only going to take us to
Emon, anyway.

02:35:31.771 --> 02:35:33.856
LIAM: I walk right through it and say, Tiberius,
where are we going?

02:35:33.856 --> 02:35:36.307
ORION: Emon. I go through, too.

02:35:36.307 --> 02:35:37.359
SAM: Captain Damon--

02:35:37.359 --> 02:35:39.133
ORION: I'll hold it for a minute.

02:35:39.133 --> 02:35:40.780
LAURA: Good thinking, Tiberius!

02:35:40.780 --> 02:35:42.436
MARISHA: And I just jump in, woohoo!

02:35:42.436 --> 02:35:43.909
MATT: You all leap through the sigil--

02:35:43.909 --> 02:35:47.435
TALIESIN: I keep jumping into things.

02:35:47.435 --> 02:35:50.355
MARISHA: I like jumping into things. I like leap
of faiths. They're exciting.

02:35:50.355 --> 02:35:54.667
MATT: You guys find yourself once again in a
small, white room. Familiar; the place that was

02:35:54.667 --> 02:35:59.902
your immediate sigh of relief when you returned
from the Underdark.

02:35:59.902 --> 02:36:01.621
MARISHA: Guys, it feels good to be home.

02:36:01.653 --> 02:36:06.073
MATT: You push through the doorway, returning once
again to the 80-foot circular chamber of white

02:36:06.073 --> 02:36:11.212
stone, where a vibrant crystal chandelier hangs
from the ceiling. There are five other doors

02:36:11.212 --> 02:36:15.805
around the room, and you are currently in the
center of the Traverse Junction within the

02:36:15.805 --> 02:36:17.234
Alabaster Lyceum.

02:36:17.234 --> 02:36:19.850
LIAM: I mean, we just did this. It wasn't too long
ago.

02:36:19.850 --> 02:36:22.640
LAURA: So it's okay, we popped out. Is the same
guy there?

02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:26.063
MATT: Indeed. Gatekeeper Xanthus is there waiting
for you.

02:36:26.063 --> 02:36:27.725
MARISHA: How long have we been gone?

02:36:27.725 --> 02:36:29.846
TRAVIS: Hold on, Tiberius wants to say something.

02:36:29.846 --> 02:36:35.853
ORION: To explain the travel schematic, it would
take us a few days to come back on the airship to

02:36:35.853 --> 02:36:40.044
this particular area if want to go back to
Kraghammer. It would be much more efficient if we

02:36:40.044 --> 02:36:44.502
teleport, as we have, and take a transport to
Kraghammer, which is only north of here, as well,

02:36:44.502 --> 02:36:46.397
which will only probably take a day, right?

02:36:46.397 --> 02:36:47.801
LAURA: Five days.

02:36:47.801 --> 02:36:49.215
SAM: Oh shit, did we leave Trinket?

02:36:49.215 --> 02:36:51.069
LAURA: Trinket is with us.

02:36:51.069 --> 02:36:52.734
ORION: Airship. From here.

02:36:52.734 --> 02:36:58.046
MATT: Oh. It is nearly a week to travel from Emon
to Vasselheim in the airship, yes.

02:36:58.046 --> 02:36:59.164
ORION: To Kraghammer?

02:36:59.164 --> 02:37:01.707
MATT: No, to Kraghammer from here, it's about a
three-day travel on horseback.

02:37:01.707 --> 02:37:04.034
ORION: Right. The airship, right?

02:37:04.127 --> 02:37:06.367
MATT: There is no airship to Kraghammer.

02:37:06.367 --> 02:37:09.296
LAURA: Yeah, but it would have dropped us off in
Emon anyway.

02:37:09.296 --> 02:37:11.101
ORION: So we just shaved off five days.

02:37:11.101 --> 02:37:13.475
SAM: Good job, Tiberius.

02:37:13.475 --> 02:37:17.414
LAURA: I pop on out and I say, hello again.

02:37:17.414 --> 02:37:21.120
MATT: "Yes? Oh, you. You've returned."

02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:22.881
LAURA: Yes, we have.

02:37:22.881 --> 02:37:27.154
MATT: "Well, this time, I would like you to fill
out the proper paperwork."

02:37:27.154 --> 02:37:32.387
LAURA: This time, of course, you already know
ahead of time that we are dear friends of Uriel,

02:37:32.387 --> 02:37:34.460
and we do not need to.

02:37:34.460 --> 02:37:40.198
MATT: "That is not true. I had my ass chewed out
by Headmaster Thurmond the last time you came

02:37:40.198 --> 02:37:45.622
"through and told me that. So--" and he fumbles
underneath his desk-- (boof) slams down what looks

02:37:45.622 --> 02:37:51.312
to be a cluster of about 20 to 25 papers. "I
require you to fill these out so I do not lose my

02:37:51.312 --> 02:37:53.422
"job here in the Lyceum."

02:37:53.422 --> 02:37:56.929
LIAM: All right, Vax pulls it over and starts
filling it out and says, all right, but you know,

02:37:56.929 --> 02:37:58.882
we're kind of a big deal here--

02:37:58.882 --> 02:38:02.417
LAURA: I was saying, Percy is so good at
paperwork.

02:38:02.417 --> 02:38:04.221
ORION: I can split the load.

02:38:04.221 --> 02:38:07.889
MARISHA: I thought we had a lawyer for this. I
thought we had Burt Reynolds, esquire.

02:38:07.889 --> 02:38:11.619
ORION: We're doing the paperwork.

02:38:11.619 --> 02:38:20.552
LIAM: I've got it, Burt. Just because you didn't
like paperwork, or Elven, doesn't mean I don't.

02:38:20.552 --> 02:38:23.120
I've got it. But Uriel's not going to be pleased.

02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:24.639
LAURA: He's going to be super pissed.

02:38:24.639 --> 02:38:25.931
LIAM: But don't worry, I'll do it.

02:38:25.931 --> 02:38:28.602
MATT: "I look forward to it. Great."

02:38:28.602 --> 02:38:30.316
ORION: Well, there you are, and here's my--

02:38:30.316 --> 02:38:31.918
SAM: Do you have a bathroom around here?

02:38:31.918 --> 02:38:33.406
ORION: Oh, Scanlan, hold it.

02:38:33.406 --> 02:38:36.282
MATT: "Down the hall to the left."

02:38:36.282 --> 02:38:38.035
SAM: All right. I might make it.

02:38:38.035 --> 02:38:47.170
LIAM: Vax fills out the entire thing, except for
the final signature, and says, Scanlan, could you

02:38:47.170 --> 02:38:48.877
put the final signature on this?

02:38:48.877 --> 02:38:49.974
ORION: Notarize it.

02:38:49.974 --> 02:38:51.226
LAURA: Tiberius is helping.

02:38:51.226 --> 02:39:01.143
SAM: Oh boy. Buttoning up my fly. Final signature?
I'll just sign my name.

02:39:01.143 --> 02:39:03.969
LIAM: That works, too.

02:39:03.969 --> 02:39:08.403
MATT: "Thank you kindly. You are free to go."

02:39:08.403 --> 02:39:09.923
LAURA: Thank you so much.

02:39:09.923 --> 02:39:11.366
MATT: "Oh, it's been a pleasure."

02:39:11.366 --> 02:39:12.513
LAURA: A real pleasure.

02:39:12.513 --> 02:39:13.948
MATT: "Very much so, thank you."

02:39:13.948 --> 02:39:14.843
LAURA: Thank you.

02:39:14.843 --> 02:39:15.762
MATT: "Thank you."

02:39:15.762 --> 02:39:16.776
LAURA: Thank you so much.

02:39:16.776 --> 02:39:18.237
MATT: "Thank you so much."

02:39:18.237 --> 02:39:20.204
TRAVIS: Okay, here we go. We'll go out this way.

02:39:20.204 --> 02:39:22.767
SAM: You know what I think? I think you guys hate
each other, actually.

02:39:22.767 --> 02:39:28.401
MATT: "Be on your way. Goodbye. Please, leave now.
Go."

02:39:28.401 --> 02:39:31.443
LAURA: Emon is so beautiful--

02:39:31.443 --> 02:39:33.345
SAM: Don't worry, I shat in the hallway.

02:39:33.345 --> 02:39:36.637
LAURA: What time of day is it?

02:39:36.637 --> 02:39:40.312
MATT: As you guys leave the Lyceum, you enter the
main courtyard that leads into it. You are

02:39:40.312 --> 02:39:45.909
currently within the Cloudtop District of Emon, a
clear blue sky dotted with clouds ahead of you.

02:39:45.909 --> 02:39:52.361
You gather it's probably around 2:00 or 3:00 in
the afternoon. No time has passed, since the

02:39:52.361 --> 02:39:54.623
travel was instantaneous, thanks to
teleportation.

02:39:54.623 --> 02:39:56.166
LAURA: You are so good, you.

02:39:56.166 --> 02:40:01.979
TALIESIN: Why don't we take a day or two to
recuperate and then make our way to Kraghammer?

02:40:01.979 --> 02:40:04.095
MARISHA: We are officially drunk in two different
cities!

02:40:04.095 --> 02:40:05.657
LAURA: I'm not drunk.

02:40:05.657 --> 02:40:07.396
SAM: Is our next destination Kraghammer?

02:40:07.396 --> 02:40:09.182
ORION: Yes. Collect our money.

02:40:09.182 --> 02:40:12.288
SAM: Let's take a night and then go set off in the
morning.

02:40:12.288 --> 02:40:14.338
ORION: What time is it right now, in the day?

02:40:14.338 --> 02:40:15.560
MATT: It's about 4PM.

02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:20.876
ORION: Could we ride, maybe? Drunk riding.

02:40:20.876 --> 02:40:25.488
MARISHA: Well... (whining) We haven't been home in
so long.

02:40:25.488 --> 02:40:27.161
ORION: We can go to the keep and say hi to
everyone.

02:40:27.161 --> 02:40:29.833
MARISHA: I need to water the garden. It's probably
half dead.

02:40:29.833 --> 02:40:31.835
ORION: No, we have servants that do that.

02:40:31.835 --> 02:40:32.754
SAM: To the keep!

02:40:32.754 --> 02:40:34.392
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: To the keep.

02:40:34.392 --> 02:40:39.861
MATT: All right. You guys make your way through
the Cloudtop District to the southern edge of

02:40:39.861 --> 02:40:47.757
Emon, to the lower slums outside of the city,
along the southern wall to Greyskull Keep. The

02:40:47.757 --> 02:40:53.675
visual is welcoming. It looks standing, clean, and
in the distance you can see a figure walking

02:40:53.675 --> 02:40:59.444
across the top of the wall, keeping watch. As you
get closer, you can see it is the image of

02:40:59.444 --> 02:41:06.000
Cordell, the half-orc individual that you guys
hired along with Shayne. As you approach the front

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:17.875
gate, you see what looks like a tent: a large,
thick burlap or linen, brown tent is set up right

02:41:17.875 --> 02:41:19.637
outside of you guys'--

02:41:19.637 --> 02:41:20.749
LIAM: That wasn't there before--

02:41:20.749 --> 02:41:21.957
LAURA: What? What is that?

02:41:21.957 --> 02:41:24.081
SAM: Cordell. Cordell! What is this tent?

02:41:24.081 --> 02:41:29.267
MATT: Cordell is looking over the edge as you
approach and he gives you a wave. "Hello." And you

02:41:29.267 --> 02:41:34.695
can see Shayne runs up next to him off the top.
She has her crossbow at the ready. She goes, "Oh!

02:41:34.695 --> 02:41:41.090
"Finally, you've arrived. I'm so glad you could
make it. Yes, this has been here for about two

02:41:41.090 --> 02:41:42.438
"weeks now."

02:41:42.438 --> 02:41:44.249
SAM: Is someone inside of it?

02:41:44.249 --> 02:41:47.528
MATT: At which point, you hear sudden rustling
from inside of the tent and a face pops out,

02:41:47.528 --> 02:41:52.373
briefly. You can see what looks like humanoid
features, and suddenly darts back inside. And you

02:41:52.373 --> 02:41:54.681
hear more rustling. It sounds like pots and metals
clinking around.

02:41:54.681 --> 02:41:56.734
LAURA: I immediately go over there and throw open
the--

02:41:56.734 --> 02:42:01.337
MATT: As you throw open the tent, at that moment,
you see another person is pushing out of the tent.

02:42:01.337 --> 02:42:04.358
And you both have this awkward moment where you
both (awkward noises) and he pushes off of you

02:42:04.358 --> 02:42:08.472
instinctively and rights himself. The tent half
collapses behind him and he catches himself and

02:42:08.472 --> 02:42:15.544
stands there at the ready. You see before you what
looks to be a young man, probably in his late

02:42:15.544 --> 02:42:25.620
teens, 19 to 20 years old. Haphazardly dressed in
scale mail armor, a longsword, crossbow, and

02:42:25.620 --> 02:42:31.558
handaxe, and buckler all dangling from his belts,
weighing him down slightly. His dark brown eyes

02:42:31.558 --> 02:42:36.444
peer from beneath his short, tousled ash-blond
hair. And a nervous yet excited smile flashes

02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:45.945
across his face. "Oh! You've returned! Ah. You!
You, Percival. Percival, the great one who streaks

02:42:45.945 --> 02:42:54.804
"fire from his tube. And the great druid princess.
Keyleth, right? And you. You, the dragonborn who

02:42:54.804 --> 02:43:00.008
"controls the elements himself. Tiberius of the
Stormwind family, yes. Yes, I've heard of you.

02:43:00.008 --> 02:43:07.398
"Scanlan. Scanlan I've heard your tales across the
land. Your womanizing does not reach ears too far

02:43:07.398 --> 02:43:08.323
"from the city."

02:43:08.323 --> 02:43:10.165
SAM: Well, I'm... Men, too.

02:43:10.165 --> 02:43:18.607
MATT: "And you, the twins. Vax'ildan and
Vex'ahlia. Oh, the many bodies you've lain at your

02:43:18.607 --> 02:43:27.165
"feet of the evil that crossed your path. And the
mighty, muscled Grog. Oh, I am beside myself. I've

02:43:27.165 --> 02:43:28.468
"been waiting for this--"

02:43:28.468 --> 02:43:29.960
LAURA: Grog the Victorious. Get it right.

02:43:29.960 --> 02:43:31.209
MATT: "The Victorious. Yes, of course!"

02:43:31.209 --> 02:43:34.889
SAM: And you are, young man?

02:43:34.889 --> 02:43:45.597
MATT: "I am Kynan Leore, son of Harold the
butcher, and I wish to join you in your travels."

02:43:45.597 --> 02:43:49.618
LAURA: Oh, darling! You're so brave and strong.

02:43:49.618 --> 02:43:51.850
ORION: Well, you're welcome to do so--

02:43:51.850 --> 02:43:53.762
SAM: No! No, not at all.

02:43:53.762 --> 02:43:58.532
MATT: "Really? It would be my honor. It really,
truly would be."

02:43:58.532 --> 02:44:06.014
SAM: No. This is not an open membership situation.
Vox Machina has been together for many years, and

02:44:06.014 --> 02:44:08.052
we've forged our bonds of friendship--

02:44:08.052 --> 02:44:10.278
MATT: "I can forge my way. I can prove myself."

02:44:10.278 --> 02:44:12.318
ORION: What is your skill, sir?

02:44:12.318 --> 02:44:17.746
MATT: "Well. My father, Harold the butcher, is
well known throughout these lands."

02:44:17.746 --> 02:44:18.861
MARISHA: For?

02:44:18.861 --> 02:44:20.405
LAURA: Butchering, I believe.

02:44:20.405 --> 02:44:21.938
TRAVIS: He's a good butcher. Yep.

02:44:21.938 --> 02:44:30.266
MATT: "Well, he is an actual butcher in the upper
slums. But! I have been training day and night for

02:44:30.266 --> 02:44:35.627
"months until I was ready to fight alongside you
all and I humbly offer my sword

02:44:35.627 --> 02:44:36.976
"as part of Vox Machina."

02:44:36.976 --> 02:44:38.046
ORION: Ah, your sword?

02:44:38.046 --> 02:44:39.407
MATT: "Yes, I am a skilled swordsman!"

02:44:39.407 --> 02:44:40.601
LAURA: You are?

02:44:40.601 --> 02:44:46.563
MATT: "I trained under old Leonard Fyke, an
ex-guard captain of Emon, himself.

02:44:46.563 --> 02:44:47.966
"He was a friend of--"

02:44:47.966 --> 02:44:49.967
MARISHA: Wait. What was his name? Linen Fyken?

02:44:49.967 --> 02:44:51.407
MATT: "Leonard Fyke. He was once--"

02:44:51.407 --> 02:44:52.532
MARISHA: Leonard Fyke.

02:44:52.532 --> 02:44:53.375
MATT: "Leonard Fyke, yes."

02:44:53.375 --> 02:44:55.731
ORION: As he's talking, I motion to open the
gates.

02:44:55.731 --> 02:45:02.112
MATT: You hear a shift as Shayne and Cordell begin
to pull the top of the gates, the chains

02:45:02.112 --> 02:45:03.586
clenching. (metal creaking)

02:45:03.586 --> 02:45:06.791
LIAM: Is he talking to Vex? Are they talking
together?

02:45:06.791 --> 02:45:08.773
LAURA: I'm using insight on him as he's talking.

02:45:08.773 --> 02:45:10.080
MATT: Go ahead and roll insight.

02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:11.437
LIAM: How close are they?

02:45:11.437 --> 02:45:13.587
MATT: They're about four feet across.

02:45:13.587 --> 02:45:18.768
LIAM: Four feet apart? I flip a dagger in my hand
and I go (impact noise) to the back of his head,

02:45:18.821 --> 02:45:20.542
is what I do.

02:45:20.542 --> 02:45:21.937
MARISHA: Just to knock him out?

02:45:21.937 --> 02:45:24.756
LIAM: Yeah. I did it. It's done.

02:45:24.756 --> 02:45:26.649
MATT: All right. Roll an attack.

02:45:26.649 --> 02:45:32.318
LIAM: Don't worry. I'm using the flat end. Oh,
good. That's a 17.

02:45:32.318 --> 02:45:33.702
SAM: Plus whatever.

02:45:33.702 --> 02:45:34.979
LIAM: Plus a high number.

02:45:34.979 --> 02:45:36.009
MATT: Oh, you rolled a 17?

02:45:36.009 --> 02:45:36.939
LIAM: Yeah.

02:45:36.939 --> 02:45:42.543
MATT: Go ahead and roll sneak attack damage. It's
a critical because he hasn't acted.

02:45:42.587 --> 02:45:45.164
LIAM: Yeah, but it's the back end of the dagger,
all right?

02:45:45.164 --> 02:45:47.825
MATT: Yeah. Go ahead and roll sneak attack times
two.

02:45:47.825 --> 02:45:49.220
ORION: I go inside the keep.

02:45:49.220 --> 02:45:50.740
LAURA: And you're touching my dice!

02:45:50.740 --> 02:45:56.199
LIAM: The boy needs a lesson. This is not a life
for a child. Okay, that's good.

02:45:56.199 --> 02:45:58.988
SAM: Oh Jesus. It's like a million.

02:45:58.988 --> 02:46:02.327
MATT: Times two.

02:46:02.327 --> 02:46:06.122
LIAM: 28 on the sneak attack damage only.

02:46:06.122 --> 02:46:08.828
MATT: Is that times two? Or is it 28 times two?

02:46:08.828 --> 02:46:11.177
LIAM: Oh, times two. So that's--

02:46:11.177 --> 02:46:13.481
SAM: Dead!

02:46:13.481 --> 02:46:15.505
LIAM: No, he's not.

02:46:15.505 --> 02:46:18.843
TALIESIN: You cleaved his head off with the blunt
end of the knife.

02:46:18.843 --> 02:46:20.741
LAURA: If he's a level one, you killed him.

02:46:20.741 --> 02:46:24.473
LIAM: It's 56. Just the sneak attack damage
alone.

02:46:24.473 --> 02:46:29.457
MATT: And then add the d4 and the modifier for the
dagger.

02:46:29.457 --> 02:46:31.694
LIAM: That's ten.

02:46:31.694 --> 02:46:34.427
MATT: So a total of 66 damage.

02:46:34.427 --> 02:46:36.097
LIAM: 66 damage, yeah.

02:46:36.097 --> 02:46:42.645
MATT: 66 damage. As you're having this
conversation, you (whoosh) behind him and (whack)

02:46:42.645 --> 02:46:47.925
right to the temple. He's like, "I'm a swordsman.
I'm trained. I'm--" (impact noise). And he goes

02:46:47.925 --> 02:46:50.129
straight down into a pile.

02:46:50.129 --> 02:46:56.260
LIAM: With my bonus action, I pull out one of my
remaining healing potions, right? And I shove it

02:46:56.260 --> 02:47:00.758
in his mouth like this, and it'll go
glug-glug-glug down him.

02:47:00.815 --> 02:47:03.399
MARISHA: That happened so fast.

02:47:03.399 --> 02:47:09.432
MATT: Eventually he's like, (panting)

02:47:09.489 --> 02:47:10.851
LAURA: Hi, darling.

02:47:10.851 --> 02:47:19.862
LIAM: I take him by the lapels. Things move very
fast with us. I don't think you understand what

02:47:19.862 --> 02:47:22.859
you're asking for. If you think you can handle
that--

02:47:22.859 --> 02:47:24.531
MATT: "Oh, Vax'ildan."

02:47:24.531 --> 02:47:25.862
(laughter)

02:47:25.924 --> 02:47:27.417
SAM: This is why he's single.

02:47:27.417 --> 02:47:31.606
MATT: "I've heard of your work for quite some
time. Show me your ways."

02:47:31.606 --> 02:47:40.822
LIAM: Illithid, all right? Beholders. Large white
dragons. I know it's cool to see her flash her

02:47:40.822 --> 02:47:48.508
boobs and this one sing a song. It's all
excitement and craziness and all the rock and roll

02:47:48.508 --> 02:47:57.858
that the kids are talking about. But listen to me.
It's dangerous. You could die any given day. So

02:47:57.858 --> 02:48:04.264
could I, so could she, so could him. Maybe not
him, but the rest of us, sure. Are you really

02:48:04.264 --> 02:48:05.994
interested in this?

02:48:05.994 --> 02:48:08.239
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

02:48:08.239 --> 02:48:11.038
LAURA: Why?

02:48:11.038 --> 02:48:18.571
LIAM: Tough love. That's called tough love. It's
not bad. That's a ten plus-- can somebody pass me

02:48:18.571 --> 02:48:21.003
that shit over there?

02:48:21.003 --> 02:48:22.510
TALIESIN: Plus six.

02:48:22.510 --> 02:48:23.766
LIAM: 16.

02:48:23.766 --> 02:48:30.269
MATT: He looks at you for a second. His brow comes
together, and you can see there's a quiver to his

02:48:30.269 --> 02:48:31.843
bottom lip. He goes--

02:48:31.843 --> 02:48:36.875
TALIESIN: Wait, wait. There. There's his heart
breaking.

02:48:36.875 --> 02:48:41.629
MATT: "I thought you were heroes. I waited two
weeks to meet you."

02:48:41.629 --> 02:48:45.168
LAURA: How could you do that to him?

02:48:45.168 --> 02:48:46.910
LIAM: Tell me your name again.

02:48:46.910 --> 02:48:48.140
LAURA: Kynan.

02:48:48.140 --> 02:48:54.347
MATT: "It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter at
all. You're right." And he puts his hand up and

02:48:54.347 --> 02:48:58.396
pushes you away. He pulls out of your hands and
takes a few steps away and looks over his

02:48:58.396 --> 02:49:01.558
shoulder. You can see now, there's tears welling
up in his eyes. He goes,

02:49:01.558 --> 02:49:04.600
"I just wanted to be a hero."

02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:05.578
SAM: Wait.

02:49:05.578 --> 02:49:07.875
LIAM: Kynan! Kynan.

02:49:07.875 --> 02:49:11.266
TRAVIS: Train him up.

02:49:11.266 --> 02:49:13.274
SAM: Send him on a mission.

02:49:13.274 --> 02:49:14.485
LIAM: Come back when you're ready.

02:49:14.485 --> 02:49:15.992
SAM: No, send him on a mission.

02:49:15.992 --> 02:49:30.889
LIAM: Come back when you're ready. Come back
again. Train yourself, and I, personally, will be

02:49:30.889 --> 02:49:32.286
your mentor.

02:49:32.286 --> 02:49:35.150
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

02:49:35.150 --> 02:49:38.906
LAURA: Oh, you'd better roll good because I'm
going to be so mad at you if you hurt him.

02:49:38.906 --> 02:49:45.969
LIAM: What's my persuasion? Oh, you passed it
down. All right. I make a seven.

02:49:45.969 --> 02:49:48.921
MATT: He looks back at you, and the tears--

02:49:48.921 --> 02:49:50.443
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck!

02:49:50.443 --> 02:49:52.274
MATT: All right.

02:49:52.274 --> 02:49:54.202
LIAM: It's a 20 on that one!

02:49:54.202 --> 02:49:55.345
MATT: Natural 20?

02:49:55.345 --> 02:49:56.263
LIAM: Yes.

02:49:56.263 --> 02:50:01.307
MATT: He looks at you with the tears welling up in
his eyes. He blinks them away for a second.

02:50:01.362 --> 02:50:03.064
(sniffs) "You mean that?"

02:50:03.064 --> 02:50:15.625
LIAM: I do. You will be my right-hand man. I
promise.

02:50:15.625 --> 02:50:20.366
MATT: He looks over at the rest of you. Looks at
Percy. Looks at Keyleth. Tiberius isn't there;

02:50:20.366 --> 02:50:31.724
Tiberius has already walked into the keep. Looks
at Scanlan. Looks at Vex'ahlia. Looks at Grog. He

02:50:31.724 --> 02:50:41.561
grasps the sword that's currently sheathed at his
side. "I will. I'll make you proud. I will be Vox

02:50:41.561 --> 02:50:52.286
"Machina with you. I swear it. I swear it!" He runs
back to his tent, and you see him start gathering

02:50:52.286 --> 02:50:58.680
up his things, and he begins tearing it down, and
you can see the tears are still coming, but he's

02:50:58.680 --> 02:51:00.316
steeled his expression.

02:51:00.316 --> 02:51:06.170
LIAM: I walk over to him. These people can't hear
this. I kneel down next to him, and I put my hand

02:51:06.170 --> 02:51:17.028
on his shoulder and say, I was once like you and
didn't know what I wanted or where I was going. I

02:51:17.028 --> 02:51:24.901
just want you to be ready. We've got some shit to
do. When we come back, we'll start over. You're

02:51:24.901 --> 02:51:33.444
starting from ground zero. Starting from the
basement, you'll work your way up. And I promise,

02:51:33.444 --> 02:51:38.998
I will be ready for you no matter what Mercer
throws at me. I promise.

02:51:38.998 --> 02:51:40.757
SAM: Mercer's our god.

02:51:40.757 --> 02:51:43.882
MATT: "All right."

02:51:43.882 --> 02:51:50.642
LIAM: Don't question it. And I take him by the
hair. Don't question it. Come back. Right on his

02:51:50.642 --> 02:51:51.638
forehead.

02:51:51.638 --> 02:51:57.959
MATT: He gathers the rest of his tent and things,
piles it up, and he's speechless at this point.

02:51:58.017 --> 02:52:05.278
You can see he's partially torn between wanting to
look hard and ready to do this, and also still

02:52:05.278 --> 02:52:09.061
blown away by the fact that he's even encountered
you guys after all this time. He takes the rest of

02:52:09.061 --> 02:52:14.607
his stuff and holds it in one arm and darts off
down the path towards the river, hops over it, and

02:52:14.607 --> 02:52:17.809
then makes his way towards the rest of Emon and
vanishes into the distance.

02:52:17.809 --> 02:52:19.909
MARISHA: You know, you might have just sent him to
his death.

02:52:19.909 --> 02:52:22.095
LAURA: Why did you have to knock him out?!

02:52:22.095 --> 02:52:23.548
LIAM: To go home and train?

02:52:23.548 --> 02:52:25.787
LAURA: We could have trained him!

02:52:25.787 --> 02:52:30.507
LIAM: We almost died ourselves in that temple, in
that pyramid.

02:52:30.507 --> 02:52:32.794
MARISHA: You just put expectations in his head!

02:52:32.794 --> 02:52:34.428
ORION: Are they inside yet?

02:52:34.428 --> 02:52:36.792
LAURA: Yeah, we're walking inside.

02:52:36.792 --> 02:52:39.763
LIAM: So we should have made him a full-fledged
member today, right now?

02:52:39.763 --> 02:52:41.935
MARISHA: No, that's not what I'm saying at all.

02:52:41.935 --> 02:52:43.815
LIAM: Make him a butler? He doesn't want to do
that.

02:52:43.815 --> 02:52:47.130
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
you turn into the entrance of the keep, and there

02:52:47.130 --> 02:52:50.585
standing, arms behind his back, is Tiberius.
Serious-faced.

02:52:50.585 --> 02:52:56.338
ORION: I look right at Vax. Why did you do that to
that young man?

02:52:56.338 --> 02:52:57.880
LIAM: He wasn't ready!

02:52:57.880 --> 02:53:04.380
ORION: Stop it. It was aggressive beyond
necessity. We should have trialed the boy.

02:53:04.380 --> 02:53:06.774
MARISHA: That was his trial.

02:53:06.774 --> 02:53:08.202
ORION: That was not a trial!

02:53:08.202 --> 02:53:10.242
SAM: We'll see, if he comes back.

02:53:10.242 --> 02:53:16.375
ORION: You are far more powerful, Vax. You know
that. This boy was a fan, at best. We could have

02:53:16.375 --> 02:53:18.227
put him to work, or something.

02:53:18.227 --> 02:53:22.650
MARISHA: Do you think he would have been happy
with work? I'm not even happy that he told him to

02:53:22.650 --> 02:53:26.868
go off and continue training. I think telling him
to go off and continue training is a bad idea.

02:53:26.868 --> 02:53:35.920
LIAM: He now knows the facts. He knows his skill
level. He knows where he stands. He will either go

02:53:35.920 --> 02:53:37.971
back to being a fishmonger--

02:53:37.971 --> 02:53:39.895
SAM: Son of a butcher.

02:53:39.895 --> 02:53:48.224
LIAM: Son of a butcher, well. Everyone has their
own personal path. Or he will come back to me, and

02:53:48.224 --> 02:53:53.529
if he comes back to me, I will train him. If not,
it wasn't meant to be.

02:53:53.529 --> 02:53:55.442
ORION: And if he comes for your head?

02:53:55.442 --> 02:53:56.263
LAURA: He won't.

02:53:56.263 --> 02:53:57.623
TRAVIS: Oh, he won't?

02:53:57.623 --> 02:54:00.038
LIAM: I'll deal with that, as well.

02:54:00.038 --> 02:54:01.863
TRAVIS: Did you never see The Incredibles?

02:54:01.863 --> 02:54:04.460
(laughter)

02:54:04.460 --> 02:54:05.815
ORION: Vax.

02:54:05.815 --> 02:54:07.917
LIAM: Yes, Tiberius?

02:54:07.917 --> 02:54:12.557
ORION: You and Grog I respect and fear the most
out of all of us. You are cunning.

02:54:12.557 --> 02:54:14.315
SAM: What am I, chopped liver?

02:54:14.315 --> 02:54:15.963
ORION: I could crush you in one blow, Scanlan.

02:54:15.963 --> 02:54:19.368
SAM: Let's leave it at that.

02:54:19.368 --> 02:54:27.291
ORION: Vex, I fear you and am slightly attracted
to you, as well. Grog and Vax, you are the

02:54:27.291 --> 02:54:29.175
strongest and most noble and cunning--

02:54:29.175 --> 02:54:33.861
SAM: You live because I let you live. Just needed
to say that out loud.

02:54:33.861 --> 02:54:40.003
ORION: You believe what you believe. I'm just
saying, when it comes to things, sometimes you

02:54:40.003 --> 02:54:47.535
really rush into stuff, and stop. Because you
could just be chill sometimes.

02:54:47.535 --> 02:54:49.780
(laughter)

02:54:49.780 --> 02:54:57.243
MATT: At which point, you hear a voice ring out
from across the courtyard of the keep. "Ah! You've

02:54:57.243 --> 02:55:03.732
"all returned!" And you see across the way, Laina,
your joyful housekeeper, comes rushing out, arms

02:55:03.732 --> 02:55:07.890
open to greet you all. You can see there's a
little bit of dirt on the front of her apron, like

02:55:07.890 --> 02:55:13.319
she's been cutting the hedges or doing some sort
of garden work. She rushes out and hugs you. "It's

02:55:13.319 --> 02:55:17.089
"been so long. It's been far too long. It's so good
to see all of you."

02:55:17.089 --> 02:55:21.916
ORION: As I see her, I turn to greet, but I want
to give Vax a little pinch on the butt. A little

02:55:21.916 --> 02:55:23.215
friendly pinch.

02:55:23.215 --> 02:55:32.300
MATT: A little tweak. A little dragonborn tweak.
"Oh! Sorry, that reminds me. Hold on." And she

02:55:32.300 --> 02:55:36.947
pulls out a little piece of paper. You recognize
it: it's used in various arcane messaging. She

02:55:36.947 --> 02:55:43.688
pulls out a small quill and dabbles it and starts
writing a quick message on it. Closes the lid

02:55:43.688 --> 02:55:45.800
(fire burst noise). It disappears.

02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:47.989
MARISHA: What was that?

02:55:47.989 --> 02:55:50.420
MATT: "I'm sorry. I was given that, just in case
you all returned--"

02:55:50.420 --> 02:55:53.162
MARISHA: Who gave you that? What was that?

02:55:53.162 --> 02:56:00.743
MATT: "Seeker Asum Emring of the council. The
ranger. He said as soon as you all returned, I'm

02:56:00.743 --> 02:56:03.466
"supposed to let him know. He had very important
business with you."

02:56:03.466 --> 02:56:07.969
LAURA: Maybe for the future, don't do that until
we tell you it's okay to do that?

02:56:07.969 --> 02:56:14.432
SAM: Seeker Emring, you said? Of the council of
Tal'Dorei?

02:56:14.432 --> 02:56:15.567
MATT: "Yes."

02:56:15.567 --> 02:56:16.881
SAM: He's an ally.

02:56:16.881 --> 02:56:21.661
LAURA: No, he's fine. It's just, maybe we wanted
to take a little nap or something.

02:56:21.661 --> 02:56:22.755
MARISHA: Yes, ask us first.

02:56:22.755 --> 02:56:27.920
MATT: "I'm sorry, I was-- oh. Okay. My apologies.
I was given implicit instructions by him."

02:56:27.920 --> 02:56:34.952
ORION: It's all right, we forgive you. I give her
a hug. Sorry, I'm very scaly.

02:56:34.952 --> 02:56:37.730
MATT: "Oh! Ah, it's good to see you, too, Lord
Tiberius Stormwind."

02:56:37.730 --> 02:56:42.414
SAM: Could you instruct the security guard-- we
can take care of it. We should instruct the

02:56:42.414 --> 02:56:47.741
security guards: if there's a tent outside the
keep, they should just burn it down.

02:56:47.741 --> 02:56:56.052
MATT: "Oh, that nice boy! I brought him biscuits
every morning. He was so sweet, that one."

02:56:56.052 --> 02:57:00.771
MARISHA: You brought him biscuits? Oh, she fed the
stray. That's adorable.

02:57:00.771 --> 02:57:06.281
LIAM: Do me a favor. Roll up his tent, keep it
inside. If he comes back to ask for it--

02:57:06.281 --> 02:57:07.901
MATT: He already rolled up his tent when he took
off.

02:57:07.901 --> 02:57:09.049
LIAM: Did he leave anything?

02:57:09.049 --> 02:57:11.691
MATT: There was a couple of small pots and pans
and things that he left.

02:57:11.691 --> 02:57:16.368
LIAM: If he comes back, let him in. If I'm not
here, let him use my room for as long as he likes,

02:57:16.368 --> 02:57:17.989
and I'll pay for it.

02:57:17.989 --> 02:57:19.186
MATT: "Okay, it'll be done."

02:57:19.186 --> 02:57:21.326
LAURA: Feeling guilty that you knocked him out,
brother?

02:57:21.326 --> 02:57:24.314
LIAM: No, I feel perfectly justified.

02:57:24.314 --> 02:57:25.884
ORION: Oh, you shouldn't.

02:57:25.884 --> 02:57:29.707
TRAVIS: Can we rest before we go see this ranger?

02:57:29.707 --> 02:57:30.816
SAM: Let's do it.

02:57:30.816 --> 02:57:36.251
MATT: Right. You guys make your way into the keep. Laina
immediately rushes off to the kitchen and begins

02:57:36.309 --> 02:57:40.660
preparing a welcome back meal for all of you. You
can smell, after the next ten to 15 minutes pass

02:57:40.660 --> 02:57:46.259
by, that scent of freshly-cooked meats and baking
bread begins to fill the air around Greyskull

02:57:46.259 --> 02:57:51.863
Keep. The halls are kept nice and warm. It's very
clean, and it's a very welcome sight to be back

02:57:51.863 --> 02:58:00.047
home. You take time to rest and exhale and go over
the sequence, and as you walk by, you see across

02:58:00.047 --> 02:58:09.700
the right from the main foyer, you can see a
little bit of the light echoing through from the

02:58:09.700 --> 02:58:16.573
temple of Sarenrae, the stained glass, itself, and
for a moment you all take a sad memory of Pike,

02:58:16.573 --> 02:58:19.781
whereever she is, hopefully to return to you very
soon.

02:58:19.781 --> 02:58:22.034
MARISHA: It's just not home without her.

02:58:22.034 --> 02:58:27.081
LAURA: Here's the thing, Scanlan, how do you look
through your poo? Can you look through it

02:58:27.081 --> 02:58:28.638
anywhere, or is it perhaps from the--

02:58:28.638 --> 02:58:35.862
SAM: If you'd like to. I'm feeling a little bit
Pike-sick right now.

02:58:35.862 --> 02:58:39.307
I could concentrate very hard.

02:58:39.307 --> 02:58:41.698
LAURA: Just concentrate for a moment and see what
she's doing.

02:58:41.698 --> 02:58:43.390
LIAM: Would we be able to see, as well?

02:58:43.390 --> 02:58:45.277
SAM: No, I'd have to describe to you what I see.

02:58:45.277 --> 02:58:48.002
LAURA: Tell us what you see. Unless she's naked,
in which case, stop looking.

02:58:48.002 --> 02:58:58.406
SAM: Of course, I would definitely stop looking if
I saw her naked in front of my poo. Definitely.

02:58:58.406 --> 02:59:01.158
MATT: Are you...?

02:59:01.158 --> 02:59:03.524
SAM: Sure, I'm going to try to scry through my
poo.

02:59:03.524 --> 02:59:11.548
MATT: You sit down and close your eyes and begin
to concentrate, and as you begin to focus your

02:59:11.548 --> 02:59:17.301
energy, the sense of the arcane mind itself has
gathered between the center of the head and the

02:59:17.301 --> 02:59:21.715
center of the chest. You begin to join these in
the center, and your consciousness begins to glide

02:59:21.715 --> 02:59:28.762
downward towards your bowels. Eventually, you find
a point of connection and you feel your vision

02:59:28.762 --> 02:59:33.391
transcending this single point on the prime
material plane. You are brought through the small

02:59:33.391 --> 02:59:39.001
channel across the astral sea to connect, and
suddenly your vision takes place. What looks like

02:59:39.001 --> 02:59:44.594
a cluster of dirt to one side and a darkened
chamber that is lit by a series of torches. Before

02:59:44.594 --> 02:59:53.123
you, you see, still and slightly muddled, the
Temple of Sarenrae as partially uncovered. You can

02:59:53.123 --> 02:59:59.735
see the large stone archway that is the front of
the partially collapsed temple. You can see now

02:59:59.735 --> 03:00:06.290
there is stone being brought down the wooden
staircase, and it is being used to slowly build up

03:00:06.290 --> 03:00:12.631
and reconstruct what was once a beautiful and very
well-revered structure. You can see in the

03:00:12.631 --> 03:00:19.520
distance a small, white-haired gnome figure that
is currently acting as foreman for this whole

03:00:19.520 --> 03:00:26.417
construction process and is giving orders and
shouts to the other individuals here. Glancing

03:00:26.417 --> 03:00:31.041
about, you see her step over, and one person trips
and drops a stone, and she walks up to them and

03:00:31.041 --> 03:00:35.638
takes them by the shoulder and lifts them back up
and gives them a little hug, and then picks up the

03:00:35.638 --> 03:00:39.251
stone and carries it with them over to where it
belongs on the side of one of the walls.

03:00:39.251 --> 03:00:41.507
SAM: She should fire that person, but okay.

03:00:41.642 --> 03:00:47.602
MATT: A few more moments pass and you gather that
this is a slow-moving, but a consistent moving,

03:00:47.677 --> 03:00:51.989
renovation of the temple of Sarenrae, based on the
limited number of people that she has at her

03:00:51.989 --> 03:00:54.702
disposal to help with the process. But it seems to
be going well.

03:00:54.702 --> 03:00:57.198
SAM: (gasps)

03:00:57.198 --> 03:00:58.594
LAURA: What did you see?

03:00:58.594 --> 03:01:00.346
SAM: She was definitely naked.

03:01:00.346 --> 03:01:01.448
ORION: Really?

03:01:01.448 --> 03:01:13.002
SAM: No, she was supervising her crew in a fair,
but firm way. She was just being Pike: driven,

03:01:13.002 --> 03:01:21.462
radiant, beautiful, and empowered by the spirit of 
Sarenrae. She's everything that we think of her

03:01:21.509 --> 03:01:29.631
and more. She's beautiful and charming. Let's just
let it be known that I could kill Tiberius if

03:01:29.631 --> 03:01:31.682
I wanted to. Just going to say that.

03:01:31.682 --> 03:01:34.033
ORION: It's fine. Yes, you can, Scanlan.

03:01:34.033 --> 03:01:39.279
SAM: Yes. I mean, that's beside the point. Pike
was glorious and wonderful and confident, and I

03:01:39.357 --> 03:01:43.091
miss her so much. I hope from time to time
I can look in on her.

03:01:43.213 --> 03:01:45.064
LAURA: Anytime you want.

03:01:45.099 --> 03:01:46.698
TRAVIS: Look through your shit.

03:01:46.698 --> 03:01:52.460
SAM: Well, it's really any bodily fluid, I
believe. I could piss. I could barf.

03:01:52.460 --> 03:01:54.516
LAURA: Ooh! Any time ever?

03:01:54.516 --> 03:01:59.408
TRAVIS: Is this real? Is it a real thing? Is it
real? He can do this?

03:01:59.544 --> 03:02:05.273
MATT: There is a gradual fade to the effect.

03:02:05.273 --> 03:02:07.919
LIAM: I'm raising my flask, and I say: To Pike.

03:02:07.919 --> 03:02:09.133
ALL: To Pike.

03:02:09.133 --> 03:02:11.526
LIAM: The best in all of us.

03:02:11.526 --> 03:02:13.796
SAM: She really was, and is.

03:02:13.796 --> 03:02:17.666
MARISHA: Our own little inspirational poster,
inside each and every one of us.

03:02:17.666 --> 03:02:19.347
SAM: She's not little, but yes.

03:02:19.347 --> 03:02:24.949
MATT: As you all drink, a familiar voice echoes
from across the hallway.

03:02:24.949 --> 03:02:26.162
MARISHA: Pike?

03:02:26.162 --> 03:02:28.010
MATT: "Your food is ready, everyone."

03:02:28.010 --> 03:02:29.222
(groaning)

03:02:29.222 --> 03:02:33.575
MATT: And you see Erwen Dastell, your elderly
halfling manservant, is there standing in his

03:02:33.575 --> 03:02:39.651
attire, smiling, happy to see you all. "Laina
would like you all to know that your meal is

03:02:39.651 --> 03:02:41.334
"ready. This way, please."

03:02:41.334 --> 03:02:42.725
LAURA: Thank you, Erwen.

03:02:42.725 --> 03:02:50.339
MATT: He leads you to the dining hall. The food is
already prepared, and you sit down to eat. The

03:02:50.473 --> 03:02:54.742
meal is very welcome; it's the best food you've
had in a while. Comparable to Southern comfort

03:02:54.776 --> 03:02:57.264
food. There's gravy, biscuits-- it's beautiful.

03:02:57.264 --> 03:02:58.670
LAURA: Fried chicken.

03:02:58.670 --> 03:03:05.930
MATT: (chuckles) It's delightful. A little ways
into the meal, you can see Cordell steps into the

03:03:05.930 --> 03:03:12.958
room and glances in for a second. "I am sorry to
interrupt, but we have a visitor."

03:03:12.958 --> 03:03:16.545
SAM: Is it a councilor from Tal'Dorei?

03:03:16.545 --> 03:03:18.246
MATT: "It is. The halfling."

03:03:18.246 --> 03:03:20.458
ORION: Invite him in for dinner.

03:03:20.458 --> 03:03:21.929
LAURA: Does he want some fried chicken?

03:03:21.971 --> 03:03:23.743
MATT: "I could ask."

03:03:23.908 --> 03:03:27.003
MARISHA: Tell him if he's okay with us being a
little tipsy.

03:03:27.003 --> 03:03:28.129
LAURA: Still?

03:03:28.129 --> 03:03:30.779
MARISHA: Well, I figured we just kept going.

03:03:30.779 --> 03:03:44.323
MATT: A moment goes by, and you see Seeker Asum
Emring arrives at the doorway. He's wearing dark,

03:03:44.495 --> 03:03:50.596
looks like studded leather armor, a very deep
green cloak about his shoulders. Even at the

03:03:50.596 --> 03:03:56.457
council meetings, he's dressed for utility. He
seems to be that individual who has his eye in

03:03:56.457 --> 03:04:04.408
many places in the room at once; he's a ranger by
trade, and paranoid by nature. His head is shaved

03:04:04.408 --> 03:04:09.757
bald, and he has tattoos across one side of his
halfling face. As he walks in, he gives a swift

03:04:09.757 --> 03:04:17.637
bow and says to everyone, "Greetings. I'm sorry to
interrupt your meal. I was notified that you have

03:04:17.637 --> 03:04:23.436
"arrived, and I have business I would like to
discuss, if you have a moment."

03:04:23.436 --> 03:04:28.563
MARISHA: (groans) Is it bad news? We're not in the
mood for bad news.

03:04:28.612 --> 03:04:32.680
MATT: "I'm all right. It's not bad news, it's just
something I wanted to run by the rest of you."

03:04:32.680 --> 03:04:34.902
TRAVIS: Please feel free to speak.

03:04:34.902 --> 03:04:39.725
MATT: He steps and finds a chair at one of
the nearby tables, clustered towards the center,

03:04:39.790 --> 03:04:48.267
where you guys have pushed your dining tables
together. "Now, while you were gone, a venture has

03:04:48.313 --> 03:04:54.560
"been put into motion. In celebration of the
agreed-upon construction of a grand bridge across

03:04:54.560 --> 03:05:00.321
"the Shearing Channel to the eastern continent of
Wynandia, a dinner is being held here within a

03:05:00.321 --> 03:05:09.432
"week. This venture is helmed by one Lord and Lady
Briarwood of Whitestone, as the bridge would be

03:05:09.432 --> 03:05:16.588
"set at the edge of the Alabaster Sierras. They are
probably en route as we speak. The bridge shall

03:05:16.588 --> 03:05:24.254
"open trade routes with the kingdom of Wildmount
across the way. I'm here because few things escape

03:05:24.254 --> 03:05:33.868
"my eye. Percival, when last we were company, you
had shifted so very uncomfortably at the mention

03:05:33.868 --> 03:05:37.389
"of these two. May I ask why?"

03:05:37.389 --> 03:05:39.204
TALIESIN: Had I? I hadn't noticed.

03:05:39.204 --> 03:05:40.819
MATT: "Well, I did."

03:05:40.819 --> 03:05:49.574
TALIESIN: I have had dealings with them before. I
find them... untrustworthy.

03:05:49.574 --> 03:05:57.009
MATT: "I have my reservations, as well. My network
has been watching their acquisition of Whitestone

03:05:57.009 --> 03:06:03.927
"since the de Rolo family fell to disease, and
there are far more questions than answers. I've

03:06:03.927 --> 03:06:09.179
"sent operatives to inquire, but each has sent me a
letter of resignation instead of choosing to stay

03:06:09.179 --> 03:06:16.707
"within Whitestone under my employ. Now, our sovereign
requested that I extend an invitation to this

03:06:16.840 --> 03:06:24.430
"coming dinner-- per your request to him, Percy--
to you, Vox Machina. I am here to ask if you will

03:06:24.430 --> 03:06:30.202
"attend, and if so, if I can trust you to keep an
eye while I do my work."

03:06:30.202 --> 03:06:33.333
LAURA: What say you, Percy?

03:06:33.333 --> 03:06:35.223
TRAVIS: It's Percy's call.

03:06:35.223 --> 03:06:42.744
TALIESIN: (sighs) Yes, we will attend.

03:06:42.744 --> 03:06:49.186
MATT: "Very good. I will contact you in the next
few days and shall discuss further. Until then,

03:06:49.186 --> 03:06:53.447
"enjoy the rest of your meal, and thank you." He
sits up from his seat.

03:06:53.447 --> 03:06:55.987
SAM: We're having bread pudding for dessert.

03:06:55.987 --> 03:06:58.216
MATT: "I'm good, thank you."

03:06:58.216 --> 03:07:00.609
MARISHA: Wait, when did you say this dinner was
taking place?

03:07:00.609 --> 03:07:02.886
MATT: "In about a week, they should be arriving."

03:07:02.886 --> 03:07:05.828
TALIESIN: Excuse me. I have a bit of work to do
downstairs.

03:07:05.828 --> 03:07:08.084
SAM: Can we go to Kraghammer in that?

03:07:08.084 --> 03:07:11.379
LAURA: Seven days in a week or in a week, like
five days?

03:07:11.379 --> 03:07:16.727
MATT: "They are expected to arrive in the next
five to seven days. The dinner is set for seven to

03:07:16.727 --> 03:07:17.859
"eight days from now."

03:07:17.859 --> 03:07:18.970
LAURA: Got it.

03:07:18.970 --> 03:07:23.564
SAM: Thank you for your information.

03:07:23.564 --> 03:07:25.709
MATT: "Of course. We shall discuss further."

03:07:25.709 --> 03:07:26.802
LAURA: Percy--

03:07:26.802 --> 03:07:28.093
TALIESIN: I've already gone.

03:07:28.093 --> 03:07:30.058
ORION: Oh, what is the attire for the event?

03:07:30.058 --> 03:07:36.413
MATT: "As formal as one may muster. If you do not
have suitable attire, it will be provided, but

03:07:36.413 --> 03:07:38.177
"please do notify the council."

03:07:38.177 --> 03:07:40.090
SAM: I could lend you one of my jackets.

03:07:40.090 --> 03:07:41.936
ORION: I'd like to see what they propose.

03:07:41.936 --> 03:07:45.316
TRAVIS: I don't really do formal, so?

03:07:45.316 --> 03:07:47.685
LAURA: Don't worry, Grog. We have a wonderful
tailor.

03:07:47.685 --> 03:07:50.380
LIAM: The fancy clothes in the bag.

03:07:50.380 --> 03:07:52.249
LAURA: In your Bag of Holding.

03:07:52.249 --> 03:07:54.693
TRAVIS: We've got like two left, and they wouldn't
fit me.

03:07:54.693 --> 03:07:59.196
MATT: "You can figure this out amongst yourselves.
I have business to attend to. Have a good night."

03:07:59.196 --> 03:08:00.752
LIAM: We'll be there. Thank you.

03:08:00.752 --> 03:08:04.609
MATT: "Of course." And with that, he turns around
and leaves. He's one of those individuals where as

03:08:04.609 --> 03:08:09.258
he walks away, and this catches your eye in
particular, for a moment you have to admire the

03:08:09.258 --> 03:08:14.267
fact that he takes naught but two steps and for a
second, you swear he was walking, he had about 15

03:08:14.324 --> 03:08:16.698
feet to the door, and he's just gone.

03:08:16.698 --> 03:08:18.175
LAURA: He's good.

03:08:18.175 --> 03:08:22.320
MATT: And with that, we shall end this week's
session.

03:08:22.320 --> 03:08:23.735
(groaning)

03:08:23.735 --> 03:08:25.223
LAURA: Oh, but I want to talk to Percy!

03:08:25.223 --> 03:08:28.808
MARISHA: I know! Percy just ran off to the
basement, to his workshop.

03:08:28.808 --> 03:08:31.499
MATT: We'll pick up directly from this moment next
week.

03:08:31.499 --> 03:08:35.304
MARISHA: Guys, I feel like we need to have a
conversation with Percy.

03:08:35.304 --> 03:08:37.277
LAURA: Yeah, that needs to happen.

03:08:37.277 --> 03:08:39.348
TALIESIN: (screams)

03:08:39.348 --> 03:08:41.581
(laughter)

03:08:41.581 --> 03:08:45.919
LIAM: So, Percy, do you want to strike off in a
random direction and just go and go and go?

03:08:45.919 --> 03:08:54.479
TALIESIN: So, that money that we're owed. Why
don't we do that? I think we have time for that.

03:08:54.479 --> 03:08:57.065
MARISHA: Maybe we could send an errand-boy to get
it?

03:08:57.065 --> 03:08:59.113
SAM: We're back, guys. We're back!

03:08:59.113 --> 03:52:16.481
