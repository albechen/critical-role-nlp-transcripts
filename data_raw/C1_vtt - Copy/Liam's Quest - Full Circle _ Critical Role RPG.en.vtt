00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.636
LIAM: Hello there! And welcome to an episode of
Critical Role!

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:04.954
(cheering)

00:00:04.954 --> 00:00:10.749
LIAM: Where a bunch of us-- man, that was good,
that was like a wall of sound and every note of it

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:16.470
was foul and disgusting. Welcome to the show where
a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.500
and play Dungeons and Dragons.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.117
(cheering)

00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:26.049
LIAM: Yeah, things don't look like they
normally do-- for us either, Matt's over there!

00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:27.999
He's sitting right there!

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:29.500
MATT: It's very weird from this perspective.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.001
LIAM: You look so little, over there.

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:31.964
MATT: Yeah!

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:32.806
LIAM: Yeah?

00:00:32.806 --> 00:00:34.485
MATT: You look about the same size to me.

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:40.454
LIAM: Oh. Well, we have a shit-ton of
announcements. I'm really excited to be a

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:47.263
jackass. So let's get through them! First of all,
thank you everybody for the survey. 44,700 of you

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:52.382
answered, and we can't thank you enough. Yeah.
We're hoping to have something fun for you guys

00:00:52.382 --> 00:00:55.893
soon because of it, so really, thank you for
taking the time to do it. And we will take that

00:00:55.893 --> 00:01:01.577
data, and I will eat it. Merch! I'm going to throw
it to Laura, because that's what you do, you throw

00:01:01.577 --> 00:01:03.249
merch to Laura.

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:08.944
LAURA: (muffled) Hi. I'm eating a piece of pizza.
We have merch in the store. We're all out of dice,

00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:15.779
but yo, we've got the t-shirts, we got some hats,
we got patches and vinyl stickers. We got all

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:17.164
sorts of shit.

00:01:17.164 --> 00:01:18.656
TRAVIS: See, our store go hard.

00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:20.137
LAURA: Go to the store!

00:01:20.137 --> 00:01:21.459
LIAM: Pop some tags.

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:26.073
LAURA: I know it's 4/20, the store kind of looks
like a weed dispensary. But it's not. It's a

00:01:26.073 --> 00:01:27.903
straight-up Geek and Sundry store.

00:01:27.903 --> 00:01:30.159
TRAVIS: We should look into Critical Role
cannabis.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.890
SAM: Oh, that'd be so good.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.408
MARISHA: Weed and Sundry.

00:01:33.408 --> 00:01:34.894
LAURA: Oh! That's good.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.256
ASHLEY: That'd be pretty tight.

00:01:36.256 --> 00:01:37.413
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

00:01:37.413 --> 00:01:39.113
TRAVIS: We're getting fired.

00:01:39.113 --> 00:01:42.394
MARISHA: Everyone knows it's true. Everyone 
in this building knows it's true.

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:45.398
MATT: We just lost Jeff Sessions as a fan. Sorry,
Jeff.

00:01:45.398 --> 00:01:47.941
LIAM: Is that available as merch, by the way?

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:48.955
SAM: Yeah.

00:01:48.955 --> 00:01:51.029
TALIESIN: Just see me out back.

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:52.786
TRAVIS: Cash me outside.

00:01:52.786 --> 00:01:55.495
(laughter)

00:01:55.495 --> 00:01:56.644
MATT: Oh no.

00:01:56.644 --> 00:01:58.387
LIAM: Oh god, how do you herd seven cats?

00:01:58.387 --> 00:01:59.645
MATT: I don't know! How do you do it, Liam?

00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:00.646
LIAM: I don't know how.

00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:02.304
(laughter)

00:02:02.304 --> 00:02:05.736
LIAM: Hey, Taliesin, tell us about this Wednesday
Club thing you do.

00:02:05.736 --> 00:02:10.231
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. This week on Wednesday Club, we
thought it would be fun to delve into manga!

00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:12.452
That's right, there's a new camera here, that's
crazy.

00:02:12.452 --> 00:02:14.658
LAURA: Oh wait, no, I was looking at the wrong one
because it's so bright.

00:02:14.658 --> 00:02:15.543
TALIESIN: I know.

00:02:15.543 --> 00:02:16.859
LAURA: That's the one we're looking at.

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.385
SAM: Yeah, we'll have to flag that off, probably.

00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:20.298
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's like the HAL 9000.

00:02:20.298 --> 00:02:22.281
LIAM: And the cameras feel like eavesdroppers.

00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:24.441
TRAVIS: It's fine. You're a baby.

00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:29.959
MARISHA: We can turn it down more. Can we tilt
down this red light more? So it's not in their

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.810
eyes? Okay. Keep going.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.752
TALIESIN: We're going to be talking about manga.
It's going to be a lot of fun. Join us, we may have

00:02:35.752 --> 00:02:39.441
a guest, we may not, I'm not entirely sure. I've
just been so delighted by this, I've ignored

00:02:39.441 --> 00:02:43.800
everything else in my life. Wednesdays at noon on
this very channel, where you are right now. Come

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.183
check it out.

00:02:45.183 --> 00:02:46.154
MARISHA: Woot.

00:02:46.154 --> 00:02:47.389
LAURA: Woot!

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:49.714
LIAM: On to you for Signal Boost?

00:02:49.714 --> 00:02:57.607
MARISHA: Angie Hill was on this week. Holy shit.
She's a badass MMA fighter who always shows up to

00:02:57.725 --> 00:03:00.659
her weigh-ins in cosplay. She's dope.

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.325
MATT: Yeah, she showed up as Dhalsim to a weigh-in.
It was like the best thing ever. It was amazing.

00:03:04.377 --> 00:03:05.822
MARISHA: She's rad.

00:03:05.822 --> 00:03:07.277
MATT: Like a very accurate outfit.

00:03:07.277 --> 00:03:12.340
MARISHA: Yeah, she came out, she drove up from San
Diego, yeah. She's cool. So she was on the show.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.823
And guess who's up next week?

00:03:14.823 --> 00:03:16.807
TRAVIS: What, high school awkward pose?

00:03:16.807 --> 00:03:17.668
SAM: Marisha Ray?

00:03:17.668 --> 00:03:18.613
LAURA: Is that you?

00:03:18.613 --> 00:03:19.609
MARISHA: No. Liam O'Brien.

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:20.402
LAURA: Oh, okay.

00:03:20.402 --> 00:03:21.523
ASHLEY: Liam O'Brien!

00:03:21.523 --> 00:03:22.682
MARISHA: That guy!

00:03:22.682 --> 00:03:24.222
SAM: He's taking over all the shows.

00:03:24.222 --> 00:03:28.012
LIAM: Yep. Yes, I'm doing Wednesday Club. I'm the
President of Nerdist as well!

00:03:28.012 --> 00:03:30.402
TALIESIN: Liam and Sundry.

00:03:30.402 --> 00:03:32.311
LAURA: (laughs) Liam and Sundry.

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:38.746
LIAM: Hey, also, Marisha, Taliesin, and Matthew
here, are going to Momocon! For my birthday

00:03:38.746 --> 00:03:41.044
weekend, on May 25th through 28th. I won't be
here.

00:03:41.044 --> 00:03:43.725
LAURA: Hey. We share that birthday weekend, don't
just call it yours.

00:03:43.725 --> 00:03:45.436
LIAM: (whispers) I'm sitting in the chair, Laura.

00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:46.854
(laughter)

00:03:46.854 --> 00:03:56.433
LIAM: Okay, so go see them if you're in the
vicinity of Atlanta, Georgia. Also, I think this

00:03:56.433 --> 00:04:00.060
is the time for you to give us an announcement
about a project you're working on?

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.657
LAURA: So, it just got announced! A new game that
I'm working on called Farpoint! Got a story

00:04:06.657 --> 00:04:11.523
trailer for it, it's a VR game for Sony
PlayStation VR, it's totally cool. I tweeted out

00:04:11.577 --> 00:04:15.520
the story trailers, if you want to go check it
out. It looks super awesome, and it was so fun to

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.149
work on, and the story was really awesome too. And
then last week, we released a cinematic trailer

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:27.756
for Uncharted: The Lost Legacy! And got a release
date for it, which is August 22nd, which I'm very

00:04:27.756 --> 00:04:29.416
excited about, as well!

00:04:29.416 --> 00:04:30.797
TRAVIS: Air punch it.

00:04:30.797 --> 00:04:32.181
LAURA: Woo woo!

00:04:32.181 --> 00:04:38.625
LIAM: Boy, everybody feels really 12 tonight.
That's good! That's perfect. Also, Talks Machina

00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:44.295
is live on Tuesday nights. 7PM on Twitch. Don't
forget to submit your gif and fanart of the week,

00:04:44.295 --> 00:04:48.577
use TalksMachina@gmail.com. Matt, you had
something you wanted to throw out?

00:04:48.577 --> 00:04:53.732
MATT: Yeah, when we did the charity drive, where
we played Mansions of Madness, about a month or so

00:04:53.732 --> 00:04:59.099
ago, one of the things that I said off-the-cuff
was that if we got a certain point, a certain

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:06.403
donation list, I'd do a two-hour hangout Q and A,
and then Brian Foster said that if we make even

00:05:06.403 --> 00:05:12.621
more, he'll do it in a silk robe. Well we hit both
those goals, we finally scheduled it. I know,

00:05:12.621 --> 00:05:15.612
yeah, yeah you get to talk to him about that
today.

00:05:15.612 --> 00:05:17.733
ASHLEY: He has so many silk robes, so it's fine.

00:05:17.733 --> 00:05:20.495
MATT: (laughs) Oh, I ordered one. It's awful. It's
going to be great.

00:05:20.495 --> 00:05:23.334
LAURA: Is it purple? Tell me it's purple.

00:05:23.334 --> 00:05:24.860
MATT: It's red. It's bright red.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.110
LAURA: Ooh, nice.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:32.348
MATT: It's heinous. But, next Tuesday, from 4 to
6PM, here on the Twitch channel, it's going to be

00:05:32.518 --> 00:05:35.584
a date with me and the chat. For two hours.

00:05:35.584 --> 00:05:37.693
MARISHA: It's going to be awesome.

00:05:37.693 --> 00:05:40.764
MATT: I'm going to have wine, and a nice robe, and
it's going to be kind of like--

00:05:40.764 --> 00:05:44.929
MARISHA: We're going to have dinner-- no, he's
going to have dinner in like POV.

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:49.117
MATT: Yeah, we're going to figure that out. I'm
hoping to do that. What was the Christopher Walken

00:05:49.117 --> 00:05:51.207
character? With the wine?

00:05:51.207 --> 00:05:52.872
SAM: Oh, the Continental?

00:05:52.872 --> 00:05:56.572
MATT: I'm hoping it's something like that. It's
kind of what I'm going for. But anyway, during

00:05:56.572 --> 00:06:01.008
that time also, I'm going to finally make up on
those promises even on an older charity, where I'm

00:06:01.008 --> 00:06:04.018
going to work with the chat to create an NPC for
Critical Role and create a possible future

00:06:04.018 --> 00:06:05.212
encounter.

00:06:05.212 --> 00:06:07.784
SAM: So we should watch that so we know--

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:11.045
MATT: (sings) You should not watch that at all,
you guys are banned from it or I'll kill your

00:06:11.045 --> 00:06:12.092
character.

00:06:12.092 --> 00:06:13.888
(laughter)

00:06:13.888 --> 00:06:17.485
MATT: That's next Tuesday, at 4 to 6PM Pacific
here on Twitch. Thank you, Liam.

00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:19.690
MARISHA: So, it's going to be you and then Talks
at 7PM?

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.715
MATT: And then Talks at 7PM, yeah, so it's going
to be a nice little transition.

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:26.463
LIAM: Almost through these. There is also going to
be a new Tabletop promo airing during the break

00:06:26.463 --> 00:06:32.506
that we're pretty stoked about, so don't walk off
and pee immediately. And then lastly, I need to do

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:38.644
a couple of thank-yous. You guys have been seeing
them all week. These miniatures here. I have two

00:06:38.644 --> 00:06:45.067
people or organisations that I want to thank. One
is heroforge.com. If you haven't already heard of

00:06:45.067 --> 00:06:51.500
Hero Forge, you can go to heroforge.com and design
and tweak a miniature just the way you want. You

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.127
make it tall, you make it short, you can make them
an elf, you can make them a human, you can give

00:06:54.127 --> 00:06:57.570
them guns, you can give them a sword, and then
they 3D print that shit, and they mail it to you.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:02.931
And that's what happened with all these guys, they
recreated my lovely dork friends as miniatures.

00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:10.488
I'm very happy with them. And I want to thank
Emerald Knights Comics and Games. They're a local

00:07:10.488 --> 00:07:18.243
comic shop and game shop that Matt and I frequent,
at least just you and me, and they're @ekcomics on

00:07:18.243 --> 00:07:23.958
Twitter. I will tweet all this stuff out, either
later tonight or tomorrow. But I wanted to mention

00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:29.655
these things. Matt and I get asked about these a
lot, and they've been a part of our campaign since

00:07:29.655 --> 00:07:34.377
pretty much the beginning. I just associate them
with Dungeons and Dragons. But they're hard to

00:07:34.377 --> 00:07:40.126
come by, and everyone's always asking where we get
them. And Julian Rodriguez at Emerald Knights.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:48.311
Well, first of all, Julian painted these for me,
so thank you Julian, they're beautiful. And Julian

00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:52.025
and Emerald Knights are responsible for these
things. They've been out of stock for a while.

00:07:52.025 --> 00:07:56.537
They're going to be back in stock in May, and
you'll be able to find them probably in your local

00:07:56.537 --> 00:08:02.302
store, but if not, on the Paizo webstore. I've
been asked a hundred times about thesel

00:08:02.302 --> 00:08:04.513
LAURA: How do you spell Paizo?

00:08:04.635 --> 00:08:06.104
MATT: P-A-I-Z-O.com.

00:08:06.104 --> 00:08:07.163
LIAM: Thank you.

00:08:07.163 --> 00:08:09.172
TRAVIS: I have a question about those, are they
edible like the ones in Fraggle Rock?

00:08:09.172 --> 00:08:10.933
LAURA: (gasps) Are they made out of radishes?

00:08:10.933 --> 00:08:12.480
LIAM: If you try hard enough.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.494
TRAVIS: I have wanted to eat those my entire
life.

00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:17.990
MATT: Oh yeah, dude. Dude, those structures are
legit!

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.538
ASHLEY: I forgot about those!

00:08:19.538 --> 00:08:25.300
LIAM: So you might have a half-elf ranger in your
party who is obsessed and will do anything and

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.470
everything to fucking fly. Boom. Done. There you
go.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.499
MARISHA: Okay, because when I bought those for
you, way before we even thought about having a

00:08:33.499 --> 00:08:38.559
show, back when we very first started dating, I'm
pretty sure they just custom-made those. Julian

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.541
custom-made those himself and just sold them.

00:08:40.541 --> 00:08:42.080
MATT: And just sold them in a box in the store.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.526
MARISHA: And now, I think, because--

00:08:43.526 --> 00:08:46.866
MATT: Like, the whole internet explosion in media,
D&amp;amp;D.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.666
MARISHA: Yeah, they're starting to make them on
mass scale.

00:08:49.666 --> 00:08:54.281
LIAM: They will be readily available in May, and
I'll make sure to update Critters as that happens,

00:08:54.281 --> 00:08:59.475
so thank you. Thank you Hero Forge, and thank you
Emerald Knights. Gorgeous. Boink.

00:08:59.475 --> 00:09:01.281
SAM: I have something to say, Liam.

00:09:01.281 --> 00:09:02.627
LIAM: (whispers) Let's hear it.

00:09:02.627 --> 00:09:06.640
SAM: I don't have an announcement, and neither
does Ashley. So Ashley, how you doing?

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.209
ASHLEY: I'm great, how are you?

00:09:08.209 --> 00:09:09.311
SAM: I'm pretty good.

00:09:09.311 --> 00:09:11.627
ASHLEY: You know, just, second week in a row, just
here.

00:09:11.627 --> 00:09:13.226
LAURA: Just to hang out.

00:09:13.226 --> 00:09:14.752
MATT: Yeah. Got more coming?

00:09:14.752 --> 00:09:15.782
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:09:15.782 --> 00:09:17.018
MATT: Yeah? You going to be here a while?

00:09:17.018 --> 00:09:17.942
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:09:17.942 --> 00:09:21.227
(cheering)

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:28.848
LIAM: With so much new information to process.
Well. God, I don't know what I'm doing. Let's play

00:09:28.848 --> 00:09:30.129
the game, all right?

00:09:30.129 --> 00:09:31.475
(cheering)

00:09:31.475 --> 00:09:36.676
LIAM: And dive into a little Critical Role.

00:09:36.676 --> 00:11:06.977
[dramatic music]

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:11.260
LIAM: It was good. It was weaker than the first
attempt.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.279
MATT: You know, this is my first chance to
actually do this to you, and I keep getting

00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:16.513
completely swarmed by everyone else, so it's
good.

00:11:16.513 --> 00:11:20.600
LIAM: Well, they're all pros.

00:11:20.673 --> 00:11:22.481
TRAVIS (laughs) The uncertainty.

00:11:22.558 --> 00:11:23.961
LIAM: Pee pockets? Is that what I heard?

00:11:23.961 --> 00:11:24.957
MATT: Not from me.

00:11:24.957 --> 00:11:25.833
LIAM: Yeah.

00:11:25.833 --> 00:11:27.866
MATT: No. I had a good one.

00:11:27.973 --> 00:11:30.470
LIAM: Sam! Let's you and I talk for a moment.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.593
SAM: (gasps) Does everyone else need to leave?

00:11:32.593 --> 00:11:35.663
LAURA: No. Do not make us get up right at the
beginning.

00:11:35.663 --> 00:11:36.950
LIAM: You.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.114
SAM: Sam Riegel.

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:46.254
LIAM: Are dreaming. You are seeing visions that
make very little sense to you. You're at work,

00:11:46.254 --> 00:11:53.534
back in one of the countless recording studios
you're in week after week. No biggie. Only the

00:11:53.534 --> 00:12:02.548
dream all goes to shit. You see colleagues torn to
pieces. A massive serpent's tail. A great and

00:12:02.548 --> 00:12:14.807
terrible god creature looming over you for an
instant, and then gone. A dog. An angel. A

00:12:14.807 --> 00:12:27.508
comedian's corpse. And a tower. And at a certain
point, you come to realise that you are in fact

00:12:27.508 --> 00:12:34.116
dreaming. Within the dream. You are in that
in-between moment, aware that what you're seeing

00:12:34.116 --> 00:12:41.446
isn't real, but you don't want to wake up yet.
Grasping at slumber still. But uncomfortable.

00:12:41.446 --> 00:12:47.257
Something is pressing into your back, a little
painfully. The dream fades,

00:12:47.257 --> 00:12:49.523
and you try to hold on to--

00:12:49.523 --> 00:12:52.062
SAM: It's not a dick, Laura.

00:12:52.125 --> 00:12:53.755
LIAM: It is, in fact, my dick.

00:12:53.755 --> 00:13:00.805
(laughter)

00:13:00.977 --> 00:13:04.738
LIAM: The dream fades. You try to hold onto your
sleep state, but that pain in your back-- which is

00:13:04.792 --> 00:13:15.010
definitely not my dick-- and the humidity. You
feel sweaty. You become aware of how hot and

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:22.171
sticky the air is you're breathing. Finally, as
your eyes flutter open, you squint just a little

00:13:22.171 --> 00:13:39.650
bit against sunlight shining down through a thick
tree cover. You're in a jungle. There it is. Then

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:46.021
you're trying to figure out if you're lying inside of
what looks like a massive, hollowed-out tree

00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:52.859
trunk, for a second? But no. Out of place with the
rest of the dark, mottled, reddish-brown tree

00:13:52.859 --> 00:14:05.666
cover far above are four rusted, vine-entangled
beams rising up around you. You're in the middle

00:14:05.666 --> 00:14:16.217
of what seems to be a square, dead-center, with
these four metal beams stretching and ending in

00:14:16.217 --> 00:14:22.407
the air. But they're not bare; they're wrapped
around with plant life and vines, and there's

00:14:22.407 --> 00:14:30.041
vines hanging from beam to beam, and it's almost
like you're in a canopy bed with no top, covered

00:14:30.041 --> 00:14:39.889
with green. Also, scattered around, you see a few
lumps of knotted wood here and there. Or maybe

00:14:39.889 --> 00:14:47.835
gourds? You don't know. Oh, your vision doubles
for a second, and you feel a strange pulling

00:14:47.835 --> 00:14:53.349
sensation on your eyeballs, your head, as the air
almost seems to pulse for a minute. You feel a

00:14:53.349 --> 00:15:10.719
brief wave of nausea, but then it passes. Oh shit,
your back hurts. The next thing you notice is what

00:15:10.719 --> 00:15:20.435
you're lying in. You see what looks like a large--
all around you, unfurled, rind, or petals of some

00:15:20.435 --> 00:15:28.386
sort of plant. You are in a plant. And there's a
large hump of brownish-red plant matter rising

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:34.042
from the center of this thing, and there's small
little tendrils climbing up around your leg.

00:15:34.042 --> 00:15:38.840
They're not moving, but they are roped and snaked
around your legs. You give a little tug, and you

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:48.218
are held in place. And the other thing you see are
two sleeping little kids.

00:15:48.218 --> 00:15:51.043
SAM: Oh. That's nice.

00:15:51.043 --> 00:15:57.888
LIAM: They're in the same predicament. There's
little tiny miniature vines, almost, whitish

00:15:57.888 --> 00:16:01.291
color, coming out of the center of this
reddish-brown plant holding them.

00:16:01.291 --> 00:16:03.209
SAM: Are they my kids?

00:16:03.209 --> 00:16:04.501
LIAM: They're not your kids.

00:16:04.501 --> 00:16:05.697
SAM: Oh, thank god.

00:16:05.697 --> 00:16:07.044
(laughter)

00:16:07.044 --> 00:16:08.433
MATT: Fuck them, they can die.

00:16:08.433 --> 00:16:10.117
MARISHA: Yeah. They're not my kids.

00:16:10.117 --> 00:16:21.348
SAM: First of all, I appreciate you making this
all about me, as it should be.

00:16:21.348 --> 00:16:24.778
TRAVIS: Number one on the call sheet.

00:16:24.778 --> 00:16:29.068
SAM: I'm going to try to stand up. Is that a thing
I can try to do?

00:16:29.068 --> 00:16:30.869
LIAM: You can certainly try.

00:16:30.869 --> 00:16:34.289
(laughter)

00:16:34.289 --> 00:16:35.643
TRAVIS: The first one!

00:16:35.643 --> 00:16:36.686
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:16:36.686 --> 00:16:37.898
LAURA: How's it feel, Matt?

00:16:37.898 --> 00:16:38.858
MATT: It's great.

00:16:38.858 --> 00:16:40.802
(laughter)

00:16:40.802 --> 00:16:41.628
LIAM: You did this!

00:16:41.628 --> 00:16:44.437
MATT: You're doing good! Keep going!

00:16:44.437 --> 00:16:46.943
LIAM: What do you want to do there, buddy?

00:16:46.943 --> 00:16:50.258
SAM: Can I sit up in my weird four-poster?

00:16:50.258 --> 00:16:55.736
LIAM: You are able to sit up. Your legs can't
move, but you sit up, and the pain finally--

00:16:55.736 --> 00:16:58.053
whatever was poking you in the back is not--

00:16:58.053 --> 00:16:59.727
SAM: Well, I'm looking, what was poking me in the
back?

00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:03.695
LIAM: Ooh, there's a really small canine
skeleton.

00:17:03.695 --> 00:17:10.618
SAM: (gasps) Bixby! Did he have a collar or
anything that I could identify?

00:17:10.618 --> 00:17:14.005
LIAM: I mean, the bone is bleached white.

00:17:14.005 --> 00:17:17.748
SAM: Is it about the same size as little Bix?

00:17:17.748 --> 00:17:18.748
LIAM: Pug-sized?

00:17:18.748 --> 00:17:19.660
SAM: Yeah.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.540
LIAM: Kind of.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.161
LAURA: Liam O'Brien killed a pug!

00:17:22.161 --> 00:17:23.682
[no audio]

00:17:23.682 --> 00:17:26.297
SAM: How far are the children from me?

00:17:26.297 --> 00:17:31.231
LIAM: I mean, you could probably reach one of them
if you wanted to. You could reach both of them.

00:17:31.231 --> 00:17:37.278
There's a girl and a boy. The girl looks, I don't
know, ten or 11. The boy's younger.

00:17:37.278 --> 00:17:41.664
SAM: Are they asleep? Do they look like they're
alive and asleep?

00:17:41.664 --> 00:17:42.850
LIAM: They're breathing.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:45.358
SAM: Okay, I'm going to try to stir one of them,
whoever's closest.

00:17:45.358 --> 00:17:46.280
LIAM: Which one?

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.124
SAM: Who's closer?

00:17:47.124 --> 00:17:48.344
LIAM: They're both equidistant.

00:17:48.344 --> 00:17:49.447
SAM: The older one.

00:17:49.447 --> 00:17:50.419
LIAM: Oh.

00:17:50.419 --> 00:17:51.332
SAM: The girl, right?

00:17:51.332 --> 00:17:55.487
LIAM: Okay, yeah. Laura, you feel like a poke,
poke, poke at your legs.

00:17:55.487 --> 00:17:58.002
LAURA: I knew it! Ow.

00:17:58.002 --> 00:18:03.673
LIAM: Your eyes flutter awake, and you see a
really fucking bizarre jungle and some little kid

00:18:03.673 --> 00:18:05.286
poking at your foot.

00:18:05.286 --> 00:18:13.856
SAM: Wait, I'm a kid? (whispers) Oh, we're kids!
Muppet Babies!

00:18:13.856 --> 00:18:18.059
MATT: (sings) Crit Role Babies, it's time to play
some shit.

00:18:18.059 --> 00:18:23.204
LIAM: The little blond angelic boy sleeps
peacefully as you guys whisper to each other.

00:18:23.204 --> 00:18:24.503
SAM: There's a little blond boy?

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:25.633
LIAM: Yeah.

00:18:25.633 --> 00:18:27.644
LAURA: Wait, who are you?

00:18:27.644 --> 00:18:29.253
SAM: I'm Sam!

00:18:29.253 --> 00:18:30.545
LAURA: You're Sam?

00:18:30.545 --> 00:18:32.486
SAM: Do we know each other?

00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:35.300
LIAM: You just fought dead Conan O'Brien.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.890
SAM: Do I recognize her?

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:38.360
LIAM: Kind of?

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.629
LAURA: Sam?

00:18:39.629 --> 00:18:43.383
SAM: Sam Riegel! TV's Sam Riegel!

00:18:43.383 --> 00:18:45.901
LAURA: Sam, you're a kid! What are you talking
about?

00:18:45.901 --> 00:18:47.652
TRAVIS: You're that kid from Les Mis!

00:18:47.652 --> 00:18:49.408
(laughter)

00:18:49.408 --> 00:18:50.509
SAM: Who are you?

00:18:50.509 --> 00:18:53.099
LAURA: Your face is smaller but your teeth are the
same size!

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:54.548
(laughter)

00:18:54.548 --> 00:18:55.668
SAM: Who are you?

00:18:55.668 --> 00:18:56.554
LAURA: I'm Laura!

00:18:56.554 --> 00:18:58.000
SAM: You're too fat to be Laura!

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.954
(laughter)

00:18:59.954 --> 00:19:05.078
LIAM: Taliesin, you're stirred awake by the sound
of children's voices arguing over your body.

00:19:05.078 --> 00:19:09.387
LAURA: You dick. Wait, who is that?

00:19:09.387 --> 00:19:10.783
SAM: Well, that's Taliesin.

00:19:10.783 --> 00:19:12.859
(laughter)

00:19:12.859 --> 00:19:14.261
LAURA: Oh, it's that kid from that commercial.

00:19:14.261 --> 00:19:17.964
SAM: Yeah, I saw him in Mr. Mom. He looks the
same.

00:19:17.964 --> 00:19:26.310
LIAM: He does, if either of you have seen Mr Mom,
he does look precisely like he did in Mr. Mom.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.396
TALIESIN: It's basically Butters Stotch. I'm
screwed.

00:19:29.396 --> 00:19:32.112
MARISHA: You totally were!

00:19:32.112 --> 00:19:33.915
MATT: You were Butters Stotch!

00:19:33.915 --> 00:19:36.792
TALIESIN: You're figuring that out now?

00:19:36.792 --> 00:19:40.779
LIAM: Just for your benefit, and for the audience,
we're going to be hearing all of the usual

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:46.966
Taliesin verbiage and sayings, like "okay" and
"this is going to be fun," except please imagine

00:19:46.966 --> 00:19:49.893
it in a small, piping widdle voice.

00:19:49.893 --> 00:19:52.607
TALIESIN: Can I have a moment to myself?

00:19:52.659 --> 00:19:54.416
(laughter)

00:19:54.416 --> 00:19:56.965
LIAM: He's still Executive Goth. He's just
seven-ish.

00:19:56.965 --> 00:20:01.212
LAURA: We're children! What the fuck happened?

00:20:01.212 --> 00:20:03.586
SAM: We were just fighting Conan, we beat him.

00:20:03.586 --> 00:20:04.721
TALIESIN: Sam?!

00:20:04.721 --> 00:20:10.588
SAM: Yeah, hi. I know, my teeth are really big. I
haven't gotten any work done.

00:20:10.588 --> 00:20:13.178
TALIESIN: No, I've YouTubed you. This makes sense.
What, and--

00:20:13.178 --> 00:20:14.253
LAURA: Hi.

00:20:14.253 --> 00:20:15.816
TALIESIN: Laura!

00:20:15.816 --> 00:20:17.062
LAURA: Yeah!

00:20:17.062 --> 00:20:18.056
TALIESIN: Where's everybody else?

00:20:18.056 --> 00:20:19.615
LAURA: I don't know! Where's Bixby?

00:20:19.615 --> 00:20:26.808
SAM: I'm going to pull out the skull. Huh?

00:20:26.808 --> 00:20:28.406
LIAM: That's too big.

00:20:28.406 --> 00:20:30.489
LAURA: But he's a kid!

00:20:30.489 --> 00:20:32.166
SAM: Oh yeah! Little hands.

00:20:32.166 --> 00:20:33.525
LIAM: Oh, bring it back up!

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:36.334
(laughter)

00:20:36.334 --> 00:20:41.958
LAURA: Wait, how old are we? We don't know.

00:20:41.958 --> 00:20:44.525
LIAM: You don't know. You're older than both of
them.

00:20:44.525 --> 00:20:47.974
LAURA: Fuck yeah, I am. I'm so in charge.

00:20:47.974 --> 00:20:50.687
SAM: I think the dog died, when we got younger
somehow.

00:20:50.687 --> 00:20:52.924
LAURA: This is so weird. Where's Travis? (gasps)

00:20:52.924 --> 00:20:53.799
SAM: Oh gosh.

00:20:53.799 --> 00:20:56.615
LAURA: Oh god, what if he's still an adult? This
is so weird!

00:20:56.615 --> 00:20:58.663
(laughter)

00:20:58.663 --> 00:21:03.440
LIAM: You guys don't see anything. You are,
again-- you saw this, and you guys are just coming

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:09.547
to and noticing your surroundings. You're in this
square, which doesn't make sense, because you're

00:21:09.547 --> 00:21:16.007
in the jungle, right? But you're in this square
canopy plant room, almost.

00:21:16.007 --> 00:21:17.811
LAURA: How the fuck do we get out of here?

00:21:17.811 --> 00:21:20.936
SAM: Here, hold my hand, and we'll pull each other
and try to pull each other up and out of here.

00:21:20.936 --> 00:21:22.369
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm grabbing it.

00:21:22.369 --> 00:21:24.941
SAM: We'll all make a weird kid triangle.

00:21:24.941 --> 00:21:27.217
LAURA: And try to pull towards each other.

00:21:27.217 --> 00:21:30.498
LIAM: Everybody make a strength check with
advantage.

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:32.802
LAURA: Wait, what do we add to it?

00:21:32.802 --> 00:21:34.553
LIAM: Nothing.

00:21:34.553 --> 00:21:35.977
SAM: I got an 11.

00:21:35.977 --> 00:21:38.857
LAURA: Ooh! I'm so much older than them. I got an
18.

00:21:38.857 --> 00:21:40.163
TALIESIN: I got a two-- ten.

00:21:40.163 --> 00:21:41.676
LIAM: A two ten?

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:42.969
TALIESIN: I got a ten.

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:50.823
LIAM: A ten. Okay. All right. Well, the little
blond kid, barely able to rip any of the plant

00:21:50.823 --> 00:21:57.840
away from his feet, but this bigger kid grabs you
both and pulls both of you out, and it just rips

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:03.101
away. It's not too bad, with you guys working
together. And now you're standing, the three of

00:22:03.101 --> 00:22:07.841
you, in a little circle, standing in this little
chapel in the jungle.

00:22:07.841 --> 00:22:09.794
LAURA: What do we do?

00:22:09.794 --> 00:22:15.271
SAM: We've got to look for our friends and figure
out what the hell's going on.

00:22:15.271 --> 00:22:16.684
LAURA: Yeah.

00:22:16.684 --> 00:22:21.879
SAM: And last thing I remember, we were doing a
voiceover session

00:22:21.879 --> 00:22:23.906
and all hell broke loose, right?

00:22:23.906 --> 00:22:24.832
LAURA: Yeah!

00:22:24.832 --> 00:22:26.086
TALIESIN:There was Conan O'Brien!

00:22:26.086 --> 00:22:27.384
LAURA: And we fought him, and we killed him.

00:22:27.384 --> 00:22:28.151
SAM: Yeah.

00:22:28.151 --> 00:22:29.287
LAURA: And you almost killed Travis!

00:22:29.287 --> 00:22:30.581
SAM: He cut my arm off!

00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:32.032
LAURA: Where's Travis?

00:22:32.032 --> 00:22:36.607
LIAM: The air around you hits you with
another (whump), and you feel your skin and bones

00:22:36.678 --> 00:22:42.569
kind of shake a little bit, and your stomach just
feels like it drops. The feeling passes.

00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:46.821
SAM: I let go of her hand, because girls are
icky.

00:22:46.821 --> 00:22:50.256
LAURA: Was that a time shift? Did we just shift
through time? Are we older?

00:22:50.256 --> 00:22:54.871
TALIESIN: Looking around, we're still in that
cube, right?

00:22:54.871 --> 00:23:04.325
LIAM: Yeah, again, you can see out. These metal
beams going up that lead to nothing, and are just

00:23:04.325 --> 00:23:05.577
sort of mangled.

00:23:05.577 --> 00:23:08.094
LAURA: Wait, give me a boost, I'm going to climb
up the beam.

00:23:08.094 --> 00:23:09.138
LIAM: Okay.

00:23:09.138 --> 00:23:11.128
LAURA: I'm going to try to climb up the beam,
because it's covered in vines, right? I can grab

00:23:11.128 --> 00:23:12.236
on to something.

00:23:12.236 --> 00:23:13.405
LIAM: Absolutely.

00:23:13.405 --> 00:23:14.462
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to try to climb up to the
top.

00:23:14.462 --> 00:23:15.326
SAM: Okay, we'll help.

00:23:15.326 --> 00:23:16.433
LIAM: Make an athletics check.

00:23:16.433 --> 00:23:17.622
LAURA: Do I add anything to it?

00:23:17.622 --> 00:23:19.231
LIAM: Add two. I'm making that up.

00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:20.545
LAURA: 15!

00:23:20.545 --> 00:23:26.903
LIAM: Yeah, totally! You climb your way up there.
It takes you, like, a minute? You don't want to

00:23:26.903 --> 00:23:30.899
fall down, you don't want to cut yourself on this
rusty beam. You make your way up, and you grab

00:23:30.899 --> 00:23:37.350
onto the twisted top of this beam. It's all caked
over with plant, and a little bit of mud, even,

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:43.456
but you can see where there used to be bolts, sort
of sprung open on the top. And you pull yourself

00:23:43.456 --> 00:23:55.287
up and over. No, that's better. And you can
finally see out and over and the jungle stretches

00:23:55.344 --> 00:24:02.706
out in every direction. You can see here and
there, on other trees-- and when I say trees, the

00:24:02.706 --> 00:24:12.865
trees are more brown and red than anything, and
they're wet, and they have sort of a bulging

00:24:12.865 --> 00:24:22.091
sausage feel to them? And they do have leaves, but
the leaves are, again, mottled brown and red. And

00:24:22.145 --> 00:24:26.732
the whole jungle you're in, sunlight does come
down and in, but it's pretty dim overall, and

00:24:26.732 --> 00:24:34.853
everything is tinted with that color. And you see
these lumps of hardened, what look like-- they

00:24:34.853 --> 00:24:39.580
don't have the texture of coconuts. They have the
texture of a chestnut, maybe. But they're just

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:45.381
growing out of spots on trees. Some are hanging
from a vine on different trees. And you can't see

00:24:45.381 --> 00:24:49.035
where to go. Everything looks the same in
different directions, although it is more open

00:24:49.035 --> 00:24:57.172
from this view, because down below, between these
four beams, it's all wrapped around. And you see

00:24:57.172 --> 00:25:00.324
two little kids going like this.

00:25:00.324 --> 00:25:04.145
LAURA: And I don't see any other sign of life?

00:25:04.145 --> 00:25:07.026
LIAM: Make a perception check.

00:25:07.026 --> 00:25:08.831
LAURA: Do I add anything?

00:25:08.831 --> 00:25:11.494
LIAM: Add a Laura Bailey plus three.

00:25:11.494 --> 00:25:12.652
LAURA: 18.

00:25:12.652 --> 00:25:25.768
LIAM: Oh wow. Yeah. About a hundred feet that way,
you see another opened plant on the ground. It's

00:25:25.768 --> 00:25:34.724
obscured by a tree, but you can see it behind the
tree. And you see a jean leg and a sneaker, and it

00:25:34.724 --> 00:25:41.395
looks bent badly and bloodied. And then you see
another leg with a shoe, poking out the other side

00:25:41.395 --> 00:25:43.322
of the tree.

00:25:43.322 --> 00:25:47.502
LAURA: (gasps) Well, I climb down and I say, I saw
a body, and we should go find it!

00:25:47.502 --> 00:25:49.169
SAM: Okay, let's go.

00:25:49.169 --> 00:25:53.592
TALIESIN: Contention point, are we wearing kid
clothes? Are we wearing kid clothes or tiny

00:25:53.592 --> 00:25:55.084
versions of our old clothes?

00:25:55.084 --> 00:25:57.327
LIAM: You're wearing clothes that seems to fit.

00:25:57.327 --> 00:26:00.411
TALIESIN: Okay. Just checking.

00:26:00.411 --> 00:26:02.045
LIAM: This is science.

00:26:02.045 --> 00:26:04.449
(laughter)

00:26:04.449 --> 00:26:06.035
TALIESIN: Kind of curious.

00:26:06.035 --> 00:26:07.731
SAM: All right, let's go!

00:26:07.731 --> 00:26:08.955
TALIESIN: All right.

00:26:08.955 --> 00:26:16.490
SAM: But wait! We don't know anything about where
we are, so we should look and stealth, maybe? And

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.002
sneak over there?

00:26:18.002 --> 00:26:19.035
LAURA: Sure!

00:26:19.035 --> 00:26:21.296
SAM: So as not to awaken a beast?

00:26:21.296 --> 00:26:23.264
LAURA: Yeah, but we should get over there quickly,
because that's Travis!

00:26:23.264 --> 00:26:24.950
SAM: Okay! Oh, you know? Okay!

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:26.494
LAURA: It should be. I think it's Travis!

00:26:26.494 --> 00:26:27.840
SAM: Let's go!

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:32.229
LIAM: All right, so after you scuttle down and
have this little mini child argument. It's not too

00:26:32.229 --> 00:26:35.651
hard, I mean, you just pull apart vines and
plants, and you can push your way through.

00:26:35.651 --> 00:26:38.433
LAURA: Be careful of the bulging sausages!

00:26:38.433 --> 00:26:42.801
LIAM: Everything is slick to the touch, and you
grease by it all--

00:26:42.801 --> 00:26:44.957
LAURA: Of the wet, bulging sausages!

00:26:44.957 --> 00:26:46.504
TALIESIN: I think that's sound advice.

00:26:46.504 --> 00:26:51.067
LIAM: Hashtag. Are you stealthing there?

00:26:51.067 --> 00:26:52.698
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, we're sneaking.

00:26:52.698 --> 00:26:55.166
LIAM: Well make a stealth check, motherfuckers.

00:26:55.166 --> 00:26:56.291
SAM: 13.

00:26:56.291 --> 00:26:58.446
LAURA: Oh. What do we add? Ooh, that's good.

00:26:58.446 --> 00:26:59.413
TALIESIN: 19.

00:26:59.413 --> 00:27:00.471
LAURA: That's a pretty die.

00:27:00.471 --> 00:27:01.708
TALIESIN: Thank you. Yeah, it's nice.

00:27:01.708 --> 00:27:02.585
LIAM: Laura.

00:27:02.585 --> 00:27:03.464
LAURA: Seven.

00:27:03.464 --> 00:27:06.384
LIAM: Seven. Okay. She's a little bigger. She
tromps round a little more than you little

00:27:06.384 --> 00:27:07.238
light-footed--

00:27:07.238 --> 00:27:08.427
LAURA: Plus I'm really worried.

00:27:08.427 --> 00:27:14.438
LIAM: Yep, got to get to your adult husband,
waiting on the other side of this tree. All right, so

00:27:14.438 --> 00:27:23.980
you creep along. There's insects, and you can hear
stuff out there, but nothing happens, nothing

00:27:24.112 --> 00:27:28.414
shocking or scary, and you make your way, in just a
couple of minutes, over to where this plant is,

00:27:28.489 --> 00:27:37.879
and you come around the tree, and you see three
kids. One kid is really dead. What you couldn't

00:27:37.879 --> 00:27:42.681
see on the back of the tree that was blocking the
view, has splintered off and fallen on a child,

00:27:42.681 --> 00:27:50.202
and that child is crushed like the Wicked Witch of
the West's sister. All you see is one mangled leg

00:27:50.202 --> 00:27:53.411
coming out the bottom and an arm coming out the
other side.

00:27:53.411 --> 00:27:55.506
MATT: It'll be me, so I don't get a chance to
play.

00:27:55.506 --> 00:27:57.301
(laughter)

00:27:57.301 --> 00:27:58.329
MATT: Sorry.

00:27:58.329 --> 00:27:59.926
MARISHA: Thanks for coming.

00:27:59.926 --> 00:28:06.796
LIAM: And a little bit of spaghetti marinara. But
you also see two kids in here. There is another

00:28:06.796 --> 00:28:10.939
older girl, looks a little older than you, brown
hair, dark hair, and there's a kid that looks like

00:28:10.939 --> 00:28:17.388
Vern from Stand By Me. He's a little chunky kid in
a polo shirt, and he is snoring, now that you're

00:28:17.388 --> 00:28:19.575
closer and you can hear.

00:28:19.575 --> 00:28:22.708
LAURA: Does it look like I would know what Travis
looked like when he was a kid?

00:28:22.708 --> 00:28:25.330
LIAM: Yeah, you know what your husband looks like.
You know what the child version of your husband

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:31.719
looks like, and that's your BFF, Ashley, except
she looks like a rebel in middle school.

00:28:31.719 --> 00:28:34.053
(laughter)

00:28:34.053 --> 00:28:39.362
LIAM: And they're sound asleep, and Verno is just
(snores).

00:28:39.362 --> 00:28:44.220
LAURA: (gasps) Travis! And I go slap him awake.
How old is he? How old are you? Do I look older

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.039
than you?

00:28:46.039 --> 00:28:47.785
LIAM: You're in your 30s, right?

00:28:47.785 --> 00:28:48.827
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:28:48.827 --> 00:28:50.965
(laughter)

00:28:50.965 --> 00:28:54.651
LAURA: Oh wait. You-- no, you're still a kid,
you're a kid too.

00:28:54.705 --> 00:28:56.729
TRAVIS: Oh. (higher) Yeah.

00:28:56.729 --> 00:28:58.244
LAURA: Baby!

00:28:58.244 --> 00:29:00.499
TRAVIS: Who are you?

00:29:00.499 --> 00:29:05.406
LAURA: You know what I look like when I'm a kid,
man! I'm your wife! You're my husband.

00:29:05.406 --> 00:29:08.786
LIAM: He's taking this really well that you're
both children.

00:29:08.786 --> 00:29:15.437
TRAVIS: Why are my hands so small? Why do I look
like Vern from Stand By Me? Where is this gross

00:29:15.437 --> 00:29:19.022
polo coming from? And my tiny 80s shorts?

00:29:19.022 --> 00:29:22.801
LAURA: You know you wore shit like that, don't
even.

00:29:22.855 --> 00:29:26.082
TRAVIS: Why are my socks all the way up to 
the bottom of my knees?

00:29:26.146 --> 00:29:27.107
(laughter)

00:29:27.107 --> 00:29:28.449
LIAM: That is canon!

00:29:28.449 --> 00:29:31.657
TRAVIS: Why do these shoes have velcro straps on
them?

00:29:31.657 --> 00:29:36.927
LIAM: Ashley, you're shaken awake, and you're
looking at a bunch of fucking children around you,

00:29:36.927 --> 00:29:39.562
and you're in a jungle, and everything is wet!

00:29:39.562 --> 00:29:40.782
LAURA: Ashley?

00:29:40.782 --> 00:29:43.380
ASHLEY: What's going on? How do you know my name?

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.678
LAURA: Ashley, it's us.

00:29:44.678 --> 00:29:45.917
ASHLEY: Who is us?

00:29:45.917 --> 00:29:47.588
SAM: That's Laura and Travis.

00:29:47.588 --> 00:29:49.021
TRAVIS: Why are you calling her Ashley?

00:29:49.021 --> 00:29:50.591
TALIESIN and LAURA: And Taliesin!

00:29:50.591 --> 00:29:54.217
SAM: From I Shot The Sheriff's Mom or whatever it
was?

00:29:54.217 --> 00:29:57.499
TALIESIN: She's the Sheriff. Did you not watch
television as a child? Good god.

00:29:57.499 --> 00:29:59.229
ASHLEY: Butters Scotch.

00:29:59.229 --> 00:30:01.103
(laughter)

00:30:01.175 --> 00:30:07.003
LIAM: Ashley, the last thing you remember is
falling asleep watching a movie on a plane from

00:30:07.003 --> 00:30:09.361
New York City to LA.

00:30:09.361 --> 00:30:19.301
ASHLEY: I was on a plane! I fell asleep and now
I'm here! I was watching-- what was I watching?

00:30:19.301 --> 00:30:23.113
TRAVIS: What were you watching?

00:30:23.113 --> 00:30:24.386
ASHLEY: Moana.

00:30:24.386 --> 00:30:26.891
(laughter)

00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:28.126
ASHLEY: So good.

00:30:28.126 --> 00:30:29.614
LAURA: It was really good!

00:30:29.614 --> 00:30:32.620
ASHLEY: And now we're here. Oh, man, this is
weird.

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.058
LIAM: Your voice is a little higher than you're
accustomed to.

00:30:35.058 --> 00:30:37.910
ASHLEY: Why is my voice higher than it usually
is?

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:41.862
LAURA: Because you're a kid! You're like you in
What Women Want.

00:30:41.862 --> 00:30:44.116
(laughter)

00:30:44.116 --> 00:30:45.173
ASHLEY: How old am I?

00:30:45.173 --> 00:30:49.338
LIAM: I don't know. You're a little older than
this one. You're much bigger than these two.

00:30:49.338 --> 00:30:51.632
You're a little bigger than this one.

00:30:51.632 --> 00:30:53.471
MARISHA: So maybe What Women Want?

00:30:53.471 --> 00:30:54.544
LAURA: No, younger than that.

00:30:54.544 --> 00:30:55.892
MARISHA: Oh, Annie era?

00:30:55.892 --> 00:30:58.339
MATT: We'll just go through your imdb and just
pick the right time.

00:30:58.339 --> 00:31:00.621
MARISHA: Just google Ashley real quick, hang on.

00:31:00.621 --> 00:31:02.135
LIAM: She's probably brushing into her teens.

00:31:02.135 --> 00:31:03.302
MATT: Okay.

00:31:03.302 --> 00:31:05.115
ASHLEY: So it's punk Ashley.

00:31:05.115 --> 00:31:08.373
TRAVIS: (voice breaking) Should all of our voices,
like, be--

00:31:08.373 --> 00:31:11.365
SAM: Yeah, let's do that for the next three
hours.

00:31:11.365 --> 00:31:14.347
ASHLEY: Okay! What have you guys seen so far?

00:31:14.347 --> 00:31:20.105
LIAM: The air around you trembles, and you feel
that same push of energy and your skull seems to

00:31:20.105 --> 00:31:26.551
rattle, and your gut goes (noise) and you feel
yourself pushing-- nothing happens.

00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:31.366
LAURA: I run over to the other body, and see what
kid it was. Do I recognize him?

00:31:31.366 --> 00:31:35.473
LIAM: I mean, if you could do a backwards time
lapse of the skull being crushed down into the

00:31:35.473 --> 00:31:37.292
ground by the tree, you might know.

00:31:37.292 --> 00:31:39.112
LAURA: I hope this isn't anybody we knew.

00:31:39.112 --> 00:31:40.989
ASHLEY: Can we tell if boy or girl?

00:31:40.989 --> 00:31:44.015
LIAM: You don't know. What do you want to do?

00:31:44.015 --> 00:31:45.378
MARISHA: Are you Bones?

00:31:45.378 --> 00:31:47.114
TRAVIS: Are there any pockets that aren't covered
in--

00:31:47.114 --> 00:31:51.765
LIAM: It's not bones, it's just all that's poking
out is a leg and spaghetti marinara from where a

00:31:51.765 --> 00:31:52.817
head was, and--

00:31:52.817 --> 00:31:54.151
LAURA: And it's a kid body?

00:31:54.151 --> 00:31:54.873
LIAM: Yeah.

00:31:54.873 --> 00:31:55.747
LAURA: That's fucked.

00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:57.180
TRAVIS: Can I search the kid's pockets?

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.307
LIAM: Sure.

00:31:58.307 --> 00:31:59.572
TALIESIN: I'll help. Yeah.

00:31:59.572 --> 00:32:01.773
LIAM: (whispers) You kind of feel a wiener through
the pocket.

00:32:01.773 --> 00:32:02.959
LAURA: Oh.

00:32:02.959 --> 00:32:04.260
LIAM: (whispers) Kind of.

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.743
ASHLEY: What is it? Anything in the pocket?

00:32:07.743 --> 00:32:09.467
TRAVIS: Is there anything in the pocket?

00:32:09.467 --> 00:32:10.656
LIAM: Just the wiener.

00:32:10.656 --> 00:32:16.238
TRAVIS: Just a little-- nope! Not a thing!
Nothing.

00:32:16.238 --> 00:32:18.606
SAM: You touched a wiener?

00:32:18.606 --> 00:32:28.335
LIAM: You guys all hear, now, off in the distance,
a whumping sound, just like (thudding)

00:32:28.335 --> 00:32:30.105
way far away.

00:32:30.105 --> 00:32:32.450
LAURA: Do we have our weapons from before?

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.433
TALIESIN: We don't have anything from before.

00:32:34.433 --> 00:32:35.719
SAM: Find sticks!

00:32:35.719 --> 00:32:39.089
LAURA: We've got to find some sticks! Everybody
get a stick!

00:32:39.089 --> 00:32:40.619
SAM: We're going to look for sticks and rocks.

00:32:40.619 --> 00:32:42.128
LIAM: Okay. Sure, they're everywhere.

00:32:42.128 --> 00:32:43.631
ASHLEY: Can I get a strong vine?

00:32:43.631 --> 00:32:48.702
LIAM: Yes. Make a strength check real quick.
You've got to pull it off of a tree.

00:32:48.702 --> 00:32:53.017
ASHLEY: Do I add anything?

00:32:53.017 --> 00:32:55.105
LIAM: You can add one.

00:32:55.105 --> 00:32:56.725
ASHLEY: 19.

00:32:56.725 --> 00:33:02.015
LIAM: 19. Oh man! You snap it, and as soon as
you do, the break point goes (raspberry) and you

00:33:02.191 --> 00:33:06.773
look like you just got sprayed in the face with
horror-movie blood, your face just went

00:33:06.942 --> 00:33:11.669
(raspberry) as soon as you did it. It burst like
an angry zit as soon as you broke it, but now

00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:16.659
you're holding this mostly solid, but with a
little bit of give, and slick as hell.

00:33:16.659 --> 00:33:18.792
ASHLEY: Do I look scary?

00:33:18.792 --> 00:33:20.227
LAURA: Yes, you do!

00:33:20.227 --> 00:33:21.811
TRAVIS: (cries)

00:33:21.811 --> 00:33:23.928
ASHLEY: Oh no! Hey, don't cry!

00:33:23.928 --> 00:33:25.074
LAURA: Don't cry.

00:33:25.074 --> 00:33:26.116
ASHLEY: Don't cry, it's okay.

00:33:26.116 --> 00:33:29.054
TRAVIS: I haven't seen an R-rated movie at this
point. (cries)

00:33:29.054 --> 00:33:30.311
(laughter)

00:33:30.311 --> 00:33:32.112
LIAM: You are still you.

00:33:32.112 --> 00:33:35.205
TRAVIS: I know, I ran out of Jurassic Park in the
theater!

00:33:35.205 --> 00:33:37.422
LIAM: I mean it's accurate. You're really scared
of scary movies.

00:33:37.422 --> 00:33:39.812
TRAVIS: Yeah I seriously am. (cries)

00:33:39.812 --> 00:33:42.908
LAURA: We're still adults, Travis. We're just in
kid bodies.

00:33:42.908 --> 00:33:44.453
TRAVIS: I don't feel adult.

00:33:44.453 --> 00:33:45.931
LIAM: Boom, boom.

00:33:45.931 --> 00:33:47.215
SAM; Wait, we're hearing things.

00:33:47.215 --> 00:33:48.331
LIAM: Boom.

00:33:48.331 --> 00:33:49.621
LAURA: (gasps) I grab a rock.

00:33:49.621 --> 00:33:50.781
TALIESIN: I grab a stick.

00:33:50.781 --> 00:33:51.557
LIAM: Okay.

00:33:51.557 --> 00:33:52.699
TALIESIN: We hide.

00:33:52.699 --> 00:33:54.739
LAURA: And hide behind anything that we-- I hide
hide under one of the petals

00:33:54.739 --> 00:33:56.356
of one of the flowers.

00:33:56.356 --> 00:34:01.281
LIAM: Okay. Smells really nasty. You're under it.
And it is wet. And now your shirt is wet, and your

00:34:01.281 --> 00:34:02.819
pants are wet.

00:34:02.819 --> 00:34:04.707
LAURA: I'm in a dress.

00:34:04.707 --> 00:34:07.975
(laughter)

00:34:07.975 --> 00:34:09.607
LAURA: But whatever.

00:34:09.607 --> 00:34:14.949
SAM: A wet dress.

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:19.152
LAURA: Do you guys see it? Are we hiding? Are all
of us hiding?

00:34:19.152 --> 00:34:22.338
TALIESIN: Does this stuff have a planty smell, or
kind of a meaty smell?

00:34:22.338 --> 00:34:23.693
LIAM: Yeah.

00:34:23.693 --> 00:34:25.556
TALIESIN: Is it a bit of a meaty smell?

00:34:25.556 --> 00:34:26.581
LIAM: Yeah.

00:34:26.581 --> 00:34:27.620
TALIESIN: Oh no.

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.360
LIAM: You ever smell that flower that's like the
world's worst?

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.159
TALIESIN:Yes, I have. The Centennial flower.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:32.114
LIAM: That.

00:34:32.114 --> 00:34:33.245
LAURA:Yeah, smells like a dead body.

00:34:33.245 --> 00:34:35.380
LIAM: But that sound's not getting any closer.
It's off in the distance. It's intermittent.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.380
LAURA: Oh. Should I come out?

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.465
SAM: Yeah. You just got all wet and muddy, and
now--

00:34:40.465 --> 00:34:44.214
LAURA: Man. Should we find Matt and Marisha,
because they were with us too? Are they the ones

00:34:44.214 --> 00:34:45.596
that got us here?

00:34:45.596 --> 00:34:48.306
SAM: Were they with us? They just appeared out of
nowhere and then disappeared.

00:34:48.306 --> 00:34:49.927
TRAVIS: Yeah, they were on that awesome
motorcycle.

00:34:49.927 --> 00:34:52.694
LAURA: Oh yeah, they saved the day. They killed
Conan, didn't they?

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:54.634
SAM: They did, but they looked super scary.

00:34:54.634 --> 00:35:00.375
LIAM: The five of you hear a snapping sound, kind
of like when Ashley broke that vine, and you hear

00:35:00.375 --> 00:35:06.085
(thud) ten feet behind you. And then you hear
smearing, rustling sounds, and then you hear

00:35:06.085 --> 00:35:08.446
(cat-like growl).

00:35:08.446 --> 00:35:10.533
LAURA: I turn around and throw my rock at it!

00:35:10.533 --> 00:35:12.368
LIAM: Okay. Roll for initiative.

00:35:12.368 --> 00:35:15.480
(laughter)

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.624
SAM: Surprise attack. We're all rolling for
initiative?

00:35:18.624 --> 00:35:19.827
LIAM: I guess so.

00:35:19.827 --> 00:35:21.156
MARISHA: Oh snap.

00:35:21.156 --> 00:35:22.672
TALIESIN: Quick game.

00:35:22.672 --> 00:35:23.732
SAM: Seven!

00:35:23.732 --> 00:35:24.655
LIAM: Seven.

00:35:24.655 --> 00:35:25.494
TALIESIN: Ten.

00:35:25.494 --> 00:35:26.298
LAURA: Nine.

00:35:26.298 --> 00:35:27.165
TRAVIS: 11.

00:35:27.165 --> 00:35:34.759
LIAM: Wait, slow down, assholes. 20 to 25? Nobody.
15 to 20? Ten to 15?

00:35:34.759 --> 00:35:35.875
TRAVIS: Me, 11.

00:35:35.875 --> 00:35:37.064
LIAM: Okay.

00:35:37.064 --> 00:35:38.324
TALIESIN: Ten, Taliesin.

00:35:38.324 --> 00:35:39.128
LIAM: Ten?

00:35:39.128 --> 00:35:40.207
ASHLEY: Ten, Ashley.

00:35:40.207 --> 00:35:42.679
LIAM: Ten, Ashley. Laura and Sam?

00:35:42.679 --> 00:35:43.711
LAURA: Nine.

00:35:43.711 --> 00:35:44.620
SAM: Seven.

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:49.920
LIAM: Nine. Seven. Okay. All right. You flip
around and see what looks like, I don't know, like

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:57.675
a really pissed off ocelot, or bobcat with no skin
on it. You just see greased red muscle and blood,

00:35:57.675 --> 00:36:01.678
and the thing is running at you, and Travis, it's
coming at you, and you act!

00:36:01.678 --> 00:36:05.896
LAURA: Don't I get that attack? Because I threw a
rock.

00:36:05.896 --> 00:36:06.975
LIAM: Nah.

00:36:06.975 --> 00:36:10.100
(laughter)

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:14.488
LAURA: You'd argue so hard for that if you were
over on this side, man, you would've argued so hard

00:36:14.488 --> 00:36:15.657
for it.

00:36:15.657 --> 00:36:17.214
LIAM: Yeah, maybe.

00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:22.453
TRAVIS: I'm, like, 11? Right? I am turning and
booking ass away from it, with my spindly little

00:36:22.453 --> 00:36:24.209
legs, as fast as I can.

00:36:24.209 --> 00:36:28.977
LIAM: Okay, that is heading you in the direction
of the intermittent whump far in the distance,

00:36:28.977 --> 00:36:30.636
but that's fine.

00:36:30.647 --> 00:36:32.886
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm just running from the naked
cat.

00:36:32.886 --> 00:36:39.030
LIAM: So, you see a flesh-peeled-- large, the size
of a golden retriever, right, a bobcat, but with

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:43.934
sinew and muscle, and it looks mad as hell, and
it's running, and so is Vern. And Taliesin, what

00:36:43.934 --> 00:36:45.478
do you do?

00:36:45.478 --> 00:36:52.015
TALIESIN: You know, I think I'm going to run, too,
at this point. I'm going to keep this stick, but

00:36:52.015 --> 00:36:53.201
I'm running.

00:36:53.201 --> 00:36:54.586
LIAM: Okay.

00:36:54.586 --> 00:36:56.279
TRAVIS: It's total Goonies run, too, it's like--

00:36:56.279 --> 00:36:58.534
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: (yell)

00:36:58.534 --> 00:37:01.387
(laughter)

00:37:01.387 --> 00:37:03.053
TALIESIN: It's a full-on Goonies run.

00:37:03.053 --> 00:37:08.175
LIAM: Okay, so, as you lift this rock to throw it
down, it happens too fast, and this thing runs and

00:37:08.175 --> 00:37:15.215
starts clawing its way up your body, and tearing
down your wet, slick shirt, and hits you for-- it

00:37:15.215 --> 00:37:16.764
ran right up you--

00:37:16.764 --> 00:37:18.023
SAM: Wait, is this Laura or Taliesin?

00:37:18.023 --> 00:37:19.001
LAURA: It's me!

00:37:19.001 --> 00:37:22.305
LIAM: Laura, and does two hit points of damage.
Just remember that for the time being, please.

00:37:22.305 --> 00:37:23.364
LAURA: Okay.

00:37:23.364 --> 00:37:24.600
TRAVIS: We haven't even opened anything.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.978
LAURA: We still haven't opened our things!

00:37:25.978 --> 00:37:27.148
LIAM: That's right.

00:37:27.148 --> 00:37:28.429
ASHLEY: I want to know what's inside!

00:37:28.429 --> 00:37:29.829
LIAM: Ashley, what are you going to do?

00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:36.816
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to take the vine, and I'm
going to (lasso sounds).

00:37:36.816 --> 00:37:41.080
LIAM: Okay, so you run up to your friend Laura,
who's getting mangled--

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.402
ASHLEY: Oh, so I'm close enough to run up to it?

00:37:43.402 --> 00:37:44.697
LIAM: Sure.

00:37:44.697 --> 00:37:47.041
ASHLEY: Okay. So I'm just going to--

00:37:47.041 --> 00:37:48.095
LIAM: You're going to try to--

00:37:48.095 --> 00:37:49.447
MATT: Try and garrote it.

00:37:49.447 --> 00:37:55.620
LIAM: Okay. Sure. Roll a d20. We'll do a grapple.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:38:01.404
ASHLEY: Do I add anything?

00:38:01.404 --> 00:38:05.440
LIAM: You can add one. For now.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.771
TALIESIN: You have a lasso at your house, too,
don't you?

00:38:07.771 --> 00:38:08.670
ASHLEY: I do.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:09.653
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:38:09.653 --> 00:38:12.043
MARISHA: Ashley's proficient in all weapons.

00:38:12.043 --> 00:38:14.045
LIAM: Seems like your number is low.

00:38:14.045 --> 00:38:14.780
ASHLEY: It's not.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:15.604
LIAM: It's not? What is it?

00:38:15.604 --> 00:38:16.548
ASHLEY: 17.

00:38:16.548 --> 00:38:19.182
LIAM: Okay. You get a good grip on it, and pull it
in tight; it is so smeared with blood, it goes

00:38:19.182 --> 00:38:24.389
(squelch), flies up two feet in the air and comes
back down and then claws its way back down Laura

00:38:24.389 --> 00:38:26.185
and just starts rending and continues to rend.

00:38:26.185 --> 00:38:30.722
ASHLEY: Can I do anything else?

00:38:30.722 --> 00:38:37.728
LIAM: Well, you can move. You can move a little
bit. You can get the fuck out of Dodge.

00:38:37.728 --> 00:38:39.934
ASHLEY: No, I don't want to leave her!

00:38:39.934 --> 00:38:41.323
LIAM: Sam. What are you doing?

00:38:41.323 --> 00:38:42.609
SAM: Any rocks around? Big rocks?

00:38:42.609 --> 00:38:44.976
LIAM: Yeah, a couple by your feet. If you reach
down and grab them.

00:38:44.976 --> 00:38:47.183
SAM: I'm going to grab one and just hit it in the
skull.

00:38:47.183 --> 00:38:48.792
LIAM: Hit it in the skull? Roll to attack.

00:38:48.792 --> 00:38:51.075
SAM: Okay. Nine.

00:38:51.075 --> 00:38:52.106
LIAM: Nine.

00:38:52.106 --> 00:38:54.773
(laughter)

00:38:54.773 --> 00:39:00.520
LIAM: You are not used to being as short as you
are, and you totally swing and it goes over the

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:04.115
thing's head, and you slip in some guts from that
kid's head, and you go down.

00:39:04.115 --> 00:39:06.382
LAURA: Do I get to go?

00:39:06.382 --> 00:39:09.277
SAM: Oh yeah, it was her turn, actually.

00:39:09.277 --> 00:39:12.984
LIAM: Yes, this whole game's about tormenting you,
Laura.

00:39:12.984 --> 00:39:14.632
(laughter)

00:39:14.632 --> 00:39:15.491
LAURA: Well.

00:39:15.491 --> 00:39:16.360
LIAM: Go!

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.287
ASHLEY: Get it!

00:39:17.287 --> 00:39:20.459
LAURA: Okay, I guess I'll try and hit it with the
rock while Ashley's trying to--

00:39:20.459 --> 00:39:22.186
LIAM: Sure, go for it.

00:39:22.362 --> 00:39:23.937
LAURA: 15!

00:39:23.937 --> 00:39:29.609
LIAM: Oh man, that rock comes down and crunches on
this thing's head. Roll a d4, please. Oh. No.

00:39:29.609 --> 00:39:31.468
Yeah. d4. That's right.

00:39:31.468 --> 00:39:33.505
LAURA: Four!

00:39:33.505 --> 00:39:40.471
LIAM: Four. You smash the thing's head in, and it
goes (squeal), and it (raspberries)

00:39:40.471 --> 00:39:43.113
down onto the ground.

00:39:43.113 --> 00:39:44.977
ASHLEY: Good job!

00:39:44.977 --> 00:39:46.242
SAM: You killed it!

00:39:46.242 --> 00:39:47.590
LAURA: Well, Ashley, you--

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:50.056
ASHLEY: No, I didn't do it, it slipped right out.

00:39:50.056 --> 00:39:52.995
LAURA: Thanks, Travis and Taliesin.

00:39:52.995 --> 00:39:55.459
TRAVIS: We're just still, like, (yells).

00:39:55.459 --> 00:39:59.500
LIAM: Through the jungle, they are just past two
trees, and you've just lost sight of them, and

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.848
they've run off.

00:40:00.848 --> 00:40:01.858
SAM: Come back! It's dead!

00:40:01.858 --> 00:40:02.660
LAURA: It's dead!

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.577
LIAM: And you hear rustle-rustle-rustle, and then
you hear (thuds).

00:40:05.577 --> 00:40:06.921
ASHLEY: Another one?

00:40:06.921 --> 00:40:08.206
LAURA: Far away? The same place?

00:40:08.206 --> 00:40:09.490
LIAM: Far away, same place.

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:10.766
SAM: We have to go after them.

00:40:10.766 --> 00:40:13.421
ASHLEY: I'm going to grab that one by its tail and
tie it to my belt.

00:40:13.421 --> 00:40:16.047
LIAM: Travis and Taliesin, you bust out of some
plants and you find yourself on the edge of--

00:40:16.047 --> 00:40:19.502
SAM: Wait, you're going to tie the 
animal to your belt?

00:40:19.595 --> 00:40:20.554
LAURA: Fuck yeah!

00:40:20.554 --> 00:40:23.999
LIAM: A different area than what you've seen
before. The tree cover is so thick that you're not

00:40:23.999 --> 00:40:30.465
able to see this coming, but you're looking at a
reddish brown bog. It's a little more open. The

00:40:30.465 --> 00:40:36.670
trees open up a bit, and you can see patches of
stagnant brackish water on the ground here and

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:47.221
there, and then way on the other side, 200 feet,
you see, almost Audrey II style, ten feet tall--

00:40:47.221 --> 00:40:53.570
seven feet tall. That was too big. Seven feet
tall, and there is a little thin wiry bent-over

00:40:53.570 --> 00:41:03.804
old man with a rock, and nasty clothes, tattered
and disgusting, and he's peeled one of these

00:41:03.804 --> 00:41:11.321
petals back and he's beating on the side of it as
hard as he can, but he's very old. And he's 200

00:41:11.321 --> 00:41:12.670
feet away.

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:15.573
TRAVIS: Is he doing it in a frenetic way or is he
just methodically--

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:20.374
LIAM: He's taking a couple whacks at it and then
pausing to rest for a second.

00:41:20.374 --> 00:41:22.221
TRAVIS: (panting) There's a guy!

00:41:22.221 --> 00:41:23.876
TALIESIN: Let's check it out! I'm heading over.

00:41:23.876 --> 00:41:25.361
LIAM: You're just going to run through?

00:41:25.361 --> 00:41:27.822
TALIESIN: I'm going to be careful where I'm
walking.

00:41:27.822 --> 00:41:30.011
LIAM: That's fine, but you're not sneaky.

00:41:30.011 --> 00:41:33.455
TRAVIS: You've got beautiful blond hair, you
should go.

00:41:33.455 --> 00:41:36.527
TALIESIN: I'm not being super sneaky, no. He'll
see me coming.

00:41:36.527 --> 00:41:43.654
LIAM: Okay. You start splashing through muck and
puddles on your way there and you make it 20 feet

00:41:43.654 --> 00:41:48.611
out into the middle of this big circular bog and
the old man goes (croaks). And you catch a glimpse

00:41:48.611 --> 00:41:57.277
of a reflection of light up on his face. Glasses?
He sees you, books off into

00:41:57.277 --> 00:41:59.371
the jungle beyond it, runs.

00:41:59.371 --> 00:42:00.499
TALIESIN: What?

00:42:00.499 --> 00:42:04.620
TRAVIS: Oh no! Wait, don't go!

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.281
TALIESIN: I feel like we needed an adult here.

00:42:07.281 --> 00:42:10.526
TRAVIS: I know. What was he hitting?

00:42:10.526 --> 00:42:12.874
TALIESIN: I'm going to go check out the plant he
was hitting.

00:42:12.874 --> 00:42:15.080
LIAM: Sure, okay. All right.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.107
TRAVIS: While he's walking up, can I look? Can I
scan?

00:42:18.107 --> 00:42:19.999
TALIESIN: Where are the others?

00:42:19.999 --> 00:42:24.341
LIAM: Verno is totally poking his head out of the
heavy tree cover, looking after you. You don't

00:42:24.341 --> 00:42:29.031
know where the others are. You are now halfway out
across this bog, mucking your way through, this

00:42:29.031 --> 00:42:33.035
little cherubic seven year old making his way
through hell, there he goes.

00:42:33.035 --> 00:42:36.010
TRAVIS: It's you and me.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:40.283
LIAM: You sheepishly whisper across the bog.

00:42:40.283 --> 00:42:42.169
TRAVIS: (whispers) It's you and me!

00:42:42.169 --> 00:42:48.868
LIAM: (whispers) I've got your back! Finally you
make it over to this big semi peeled-open gourd,

00:42:48.868 --> 00:42:54.246
and you look inside to see what's in there, and
you see a head of red hair.

00:42:54.246 --> 00:42:56.740
Oh, she's an older girl.

00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:00.066
TALIESIN: I start peeling that thing open and try
to pull her out.

00:43:00.066 --> 00:43:01.102
LIAM: Make a strength check.

00:43:01.102 --> 00:43:02.362
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

00:43:02.362 --> 00:43:03.934
TALIESIN: It's fine! Help me!

00:43:03.934 --> 00:43:05.012
TRAVIS: No!

00:43:05.012 --> 00:43:06.350
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:12.783
LIAM: Natural 20! Okay, so you reach up as high up
as you can and you hang from it, and it just peels

00:43:12.783 --> 00:43:23.675
open. And a teenager spills out, unconscious, long
red hair, flannel shirt. Unconscious.

00:43:23.675 --> 00:43:25.063
TALIESIN: Matt, are you okay?

00:43:25.063 --> 00:43:27.834
(laughing)

00:43:27.834 --> 00:43:32.954
LIAM: There is another body further in. You see
just the barest glimpse of a Hawaiian shirt.

00:43:32.954 --> 00:43:36.055
(laughing)

00:43:36.055 --> 00:43:39.509
TRAVIS: What does the hair look like?

00:43:39.509 --> 00:43:47.552
TALIESIN: I'm coming to get you, Liam! Hold on!
I'm going to start pulling him out, too.

00:43:47.552 --> 00:43:48.621
TRAVIS: You're going in there?

00:43:48.621 --> 00:43:49.892
TALIESIN: Travis, help out!

00:43:49.892 --> 00:43:50.769
TRAVIS: Okay!

00:43:50.769 --> 00:43:51.954
LIAM: You're pulling who? Who are you pulling?

00:43:51.954 --> 00:43:53.134
TALIESIN: I'm pulling the Hawaiian shirt out of
there.

00:43:53.134 --> 00:43:57.348
LIAM: You're pulling Hawaiian shirt? Well, he's
caught; his feet are caught up in the same--

00:43:57.348 --> 00:44:00.528
TALIESIN: I'm going to start using the stick to
wedge him out.

00:44:00.528 --> 00:44:04.135
LIAM: You're going to use a stick? All right. I'm
going to give you no advantage for that roll. A

00:44:04.135 --> 00:44:05.111
strength check.

00:44:05.111 --> 00:44:06.245
TALIESIN: That's fine. No advantage?

00:44:06.245 --> 00:44:07.244
LIAM: No advantage.

00:44:07.244 --> 00:44:08.245
TALIESIN: That's fine. Just a strength roll?

00:44:08.245 --> 00:44:09.197
LIAM: Strength roll.

00:44:09.197 --> 00:44:11.435
TALIESIN: Doesn't matter, it's just a d20, I
suppose. No plus? That's a one.

00:44:11.435 --> 00:44:17.590
LIAM: Aw man, feeling so proud of yourself, so
brave, so strong, pulling that open, and now

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:23.126
you're just doing a little Looney Tunes. Your feet
are just scuttling in the slick wet of this swamp

00:44:23.196 --> 00:44:24.757
and you're making no headway.

00:44:24.757 --> 00:44:26.163
TRAVIS: Can I try to help him?

00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:26.981
TALIESIN: Please.

00:44:26.981 --> 00:44:28.225
LIAM: Sure, are you going to go catch up?

00:44:28.225 --> 00:44:28.917
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:44:28.917 --> 00:44:30.322
LIAM: All right. You hear (splashes).

00:44:30.322 --> 00:44:33.541
TALIESIN: I give up and roll down and try to wake
Marisha up.

00:44:33.541 --> 00:44:38.478
LIAM: Okay. Oh, you give her a slap? Marisha, you
are woken out of your sleep

00:44:38.478 --> 00:44:39.834
getting slapped in the face.

00:44:39.834 --> 00:44:41.298
MARISHA: I immediately grab his wrist.

00:44:41.298 --> 00:44:42.382
LIAM: Yes, you do.

00:44:42.382 --> 00:44:44.767
TALIESIN: Wake up, there's a lot going on!

00:44:44.767 --> 00:44:47.366
MARISHA: Who the fuck? What is--

00:44:47.366 --> 00:44:50.146
TALIESIN: Mr. Mom. You know exactly who I am.

00:44:50.146 --> 00:44:53.405
MARISHA: Oh, you're from my future!

00:44:53.405 --> 00:44:57.207
TALIESIN: Now I'm really confused. Hi.

00:44:57.207 --> 00:44:58.221
MARISHA: Hi.

00:44:58.221 --> 00:44:59.340
TALIESIN: It's Taliesin.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:00.315
MARISHA: It's Marisha.

00:45:00.315 --> 00:45:01.694
TALIESIN: You're a teenager.

00:45:01.694 --> 00:45:06.965
MARISHA: (brokenly) No! Not again!

00:45:06.965 --> 00:45:11.679
LIAM: The last thing you remember is falling
asleep, resting your head on your keyboard in your

00:45:11.679 --> 00:45:13.800
office at Geek and Sundry.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:17.078
SAM: Listening to Moana.

00:45:17.078 --> 00:45:21.711
MARISHA: You're welcome. What? Who? Huh?

00:45:21.711 --> 00:45:26.777
TALIESIN: I point at the Hawaiian shirt and
Travis. Are you pulling by this point? There's a

00:45:26.777 --> 00:45:31.418
lot going on. I don't know. Help.

00:45:31.418 --> 00:45:35.280
LIAM: Marisha, you look over and see a face very
much like one you've seen in many photographs

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:42.532
dressed as Sephiroth, except with glasses and a
Hawaiian shirt and just so peaceful and sweet.

00:45:42.532 --> 00:45:43.714
Asleep.

00:45:43.714 --> 00:45:47.590
MARISHA: Oh, it's glasses Matt! Oh my god!

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:48.969
TRAVIS: Does he have any facial hair?

00:45:48.969 --> 00:45:50.398
MATT: What age is this, about?

00:45:50.398 --> 00:45:54.776
LIAM: 12, 13, 14? 12?

00:45:54.776 --> 00:45:58.540
MATT: Okay, so yeah, glasses, nearing a mullet.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:00.275
MARISHA: Yeah, nearing mullets phase.

00:46:00.275 --> 00:46:05.617
MATT: And it looks like a Hawaiian shirt. It's
more like a bowling shirt with a cool-looking

00:46:05.617 --> 00:46:06.932
anime dragon on it.

00:46:06.932 --> 00:46:08.843
LAURA: Dragon Ball Z bowling shirt!

00:46:08.843 --> 00:46:09.846
MATT: Yeah.

00:46:09.846 --> 00:46:12.100
LIAM: Why don't you guys all open your manilla
envelopes.

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:20.251
(cheering)

00:46:20.419 --> 00:46:22.361
SAM: Ooh! So cute!

00:46:22.361 --> 00:46:34.216
(laughter)

00:46:34.282 --> 00:46:35.899
ASHLEY: Oh my god!

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:37.340
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

00:46:37.367 --> 00:46:38.723
MATT: That's straight up.

00:46:38.723 --> 00:46:39.970
TALIESIN: Liam, that's so solid!

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:41.807
TRAVIS: Marisha's a badass bitch!

00:46:41.807 --> 00:46:44.083
TALIESIN: I know exactly what picture they used
for this!

00:46:44.083 --> 00:46:46.877
MARISHA: I'm in Kentucky at this phase!

00:46:46.877 --> 00:46:50.688
LAURA: Ah, yeah. Aw, Hawaiian shirt Matt!

00:46:50.688 --> 00:46:55.362
MATT: Yeah. That's about as accurate as you'll ever
get.

00:46:55.362 --> 00:46:56.835
ASHLEY: This is the best.

00:46:56.893 --> 00:46:58.288
MARISHA: Taliesin!

00:46:58.288 --> 00:47:00.164
ASHLEY: Why didn't we know each other as kids?

00:47:00.164 --> 00:47:01.889
MARISHA: You look like a Ralph Bakshi cartoon!

00:47:01.889 --> 00:47:03.058
LAURA: You're so cute!

00:47:03.058 --> 00:47:04.465
MATT: Oh, Travis!

00:47:04.465 --> 00:47:11.227
TRAVIS: Just not sure of anything! My mom gave me
this shirt.

00:47:11.227 --> 00:47:12.787
TALIESIN: That's amazing.

00:47:12.787 --> 00:47:16.893
LIAM: Like the Grinch, my heart just grew two
sizes in my chest.

00:47:16.893 --> 00:47:19.001
(laughing)

00:47:19.001 --> 00:47:24.871
LIAM: A couple of minutes pass and the rest of you
catch up. You two are still-- your feet are glued

00:47:24.871 --> 00:47:26.647
into this plant.

00:47:26.647 --> 00:47:29.036
MARISHA: Fists, bra?

00:47:29.036 --> 00:47:37.063
LIAM: You're glued into place and you're sizing
each other up and you can tell fairly quickly--

00:47:37.063 --> 00:47:41.668
you don't know how old everyone is, but who the
oldest is, who the youngest is. Marisha is taller

00:47:41.668 --> 00:47:50.802
than anyone here, clearly mid-to-late teens. Under
her, maybe Ashley, Laura and Matt kind of in the

00:47:50.802 --> 00:47:56.109
same zone. It's hard to say between Sam and
Taliesin.

00:47:56.109 --> 00:47:59.217
TALIESIN: I was a tiny child. I was a tiny, tiny
child.

00:47:59.217 --> 00:48:00.707
SAM: We were theater children.

00:48:00.707 --> 00:48:02.215
LAURA: I also was very small.

00:48:02.215 --> 00:48:04.786
SAM: So, eight, nine-ish? Maybe?

00:48:04.786 --> 00:48:06.710
LIAM: Yeah, ish.

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:13.553
MARISHA: Why are all the girls more developed? Is
this indicative of puberty? Is this a statement?

00:48:13.553 --> 00:48:15.060
LAURA: Our mental state?

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:18.832
LIAM: Art is open to interpretation, Marisha.

00:48:18.832 --> 00:48:22.553
LAURA: I'm down two hit points! I've only got
eight hit points!

00:48:22.553 --> 00:48:25.778
LIAM: Not anymore. Oh, now you do. From ten to
eight.

00:48:25.778 --> 00:48:27.736
LAURA: No, no, I had eight.

00:48:27.736 --> 00:48:29.213
LIAM: You had eight and now you're at six?

00:48:29.213 --> 00:48:29.911
LAURA: Yeah.

00:48:29.911 --> 00:48:31.018
LIAM: Better be careful.

00:48:31.018 --> 00:48:32.359
LAURA: Jeez Louise, Liam.

00:48:32.359 --> 00:48:34.524
LIAM: You guys are in the middle of--

00:48:34.524 --> 00:48:36.042
MARISHA: How many hit points do I have?

00:48:36.042 --> 00:48:37.429
LIAM: It doesn't say?

00:48:37.429 --> 00:48:38.518
MARISHA: No.

00:48:38.518 --> 00:48:42.946
LIAM: You've got, let's say nine.

00:48:42.946 --> 00:48:44.086
MARISHA: Nine.

00:48:44.086 --> 00:48:45.159
LIAM: Because you're so tall.

00:48:45.159 --> 00:48:46.061
LAURA: What do you have?

00:48:46.061 --> 00:48:47.212
ASHLEY: 11.

00:48:47.212 --> 00:48:49.294
LAURA: (gasps) You have a high constitution.

00:48:49.294 --> 00:48:54.141
ASHLEY: Because I've always been a little tough as
fuck.

00:48:54.141 --> 00:49:01.067
LIAM: Anyway. Guys, you are in the middle of a
very alien jungle. You don't know where the fuck

00:49:01.067 --> 00:49:05.786
you are, you don't know what is going on, you
don't know why you are children. What are you

00:49:05.786 --> 00:49:07.838
going to do? Are you going to build a house and
live here?

00:49:07.838 --> 00:49:11.071
SAM: I guess so. Wait, are we together again?

00:49:11.071 --> 00:49:12.837
LAURA: Did we catch up?

00:49:12.837 --> 00:49:15.100
LIAM: Yeah, everyone is here. Is Matt sleeping?

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:16.198
MARISHA: Wait, is he not alive?

00:49:16.198 --> 00:49:17.781
LAURA: He's not out of the flower yet.

00:49:17.781 --> 00:49:19.074
MATT: I'm still inside the flower.

00:49:19.074 --> 00:49:22.183
MARISHA: Oh, right. Okay. I'll go over and be
like, yo.

00:49:22.183 --> 00:49:24.247
MATT: Huh? What?

00:49:24.247 --> 00:49:26.239
MARISHA: We're kids!

00:49:26.239 --> 00:49:28.414
ASHLEY: Hey, Matt!

00:49:28.414 --> 00:49:29.925
MATT: I don't like this nightmare.

00:49:30.101 --> 00:49:31.409
(laughter)

00:49:31.409 --> 00:49:32.678
MATT: What?

00:49:32.678 --> 00:49:34.578
MARISHA: This is real!

00:49:34.578 --> 00:49:36.765
TRAVIS: Can I see your glasses?

00:49:36.765 --> 00:49:38.873
MATT: Sure.

00:49:38.873 --> 00:49:43.566
LIAM: Matt, apparently three Monster energy drinks
are not enough to keep you awake working on the

00:49:43.566 --> 00:49:50.516
campaign book and you pass out on your desktop at
home. That's the last thing you remember. And you

00:49:50.516 --> 00:49:51.691
were tall.

00:49:51.691 --> 00:49:54.501
MATT: So I'm taking my glasses off, I'm like,
okay, so--

00:49:54.501 --> 00:49:57.173
LAURA: Oh, I can still see!

00:49:57.173 --> 00:49:58.953
MATT: What? I can't!

00:49:58.953 --> 00:50:01.124
(laughter)

00:50:01.124 --> 00:50:07.725
MATT: I'm going to keep-- and I look down, am I
still in this giant Audrey II-type plant?

00:50:07.725 --> 00:50:09.275
LIAM: You can sit up, that's about it.

00:50:09.275 --> 00:50:12.724
MATT: Oh jeez! (yells)

00:50:12.724 --> 00:50:15.496
LAURA: Can we try to pull the flower back?

00:50:15.496 --> 00:50:17.208
LIAM: Yeah, sure, you can pull.

00:50:17.208 --> 00:50:19.889
MARISHA: Me and Ashley (straining noises).

00:50:19.889 --> 00:50:22.636
LIAM: Matt, make a strength check at advantage.

00:50:22.636 --> 00:50:25.339
MATT: They do it?

00:50:25.339 --> 00:50:27.209
LIAM: No, just you. Because you're pushing to--

00:50:27.209 --> 00:50:28.816
SAM and LAURA: Just Matt.

00:50:28.816 --> 00:50:29.769
MARISHA: Oh.

00:50:29.769 --> 00:50:30.720
MATT: She got a ten.

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.461
LIAM: Thanks, Keyleth.

00:50:32.461 --> 00:50:34.450
MARISHA: Different universe! Different one!

00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:36.150
MATT: That's a 19.

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:40.949
LIAM: That's fine. You explode out of this
motherfucker like Superman and jump and land on

00:50:40.949 --> 00:50:46.773
your feet in the middle of the muck, full of
adrenaline, and you have no idea what to do.

00:50:46.773 --> 00:50:49.387
MATT: That was the coolest thing I ever did at
this age, guys. I'm glad you

00:50:49.387 --> 00:50:51.015
were here to witness it.

00:50:51.015 --> 00:50:52.454
ASHLEY: Matt.

00:50:52.454 --> 00:50:53.647
MATT: What?

00:50:53.647 --> 00:50:56.555
ASHLEY: You look fucking rad.

00:50:56.555 --> 00:50:58.372
(laughing)

00:50:58.372 --> 00:51:04.764
MATT: Okay, that's the coolest thing to happen to
me at this age. This was not a good age, actually.

00:51:04.764 --> 00:51:06.457
I really don't--

00:51:06.457 --> 00:51:12.885
SAM: Something's going on. We're in a weird forest
swamp. There are weird demon dogs that are

00:51:12.885 --> 00:51:13.836
attacking us--

00:51:13.836 --> 00:51:14.876
LAURA: It was a cat!

00:51:14.876 --> 00:51:15.671
SAM: Was it?

00:51:15.671 --> 00:51:16.362
LAURA: Yeah.

00:51:16.362 --> 00:51:17.341
TRAVIS: Naked and hairless.

00:51:17.341 --> 00:51:19.488
LAURA: It was hairless. Oh, Ashley's got it,
still.

00:51:19.488 --> 00:51:21.221
ASHLEY: It's on my belt.

00:51:21.274 --> 00:51:23.443
MATT: That's skinless. That's skinless!

00:51:23.443 --> 00:51:27.013
LAURA: Yeah! Look around, we're in giant fucking
plants. We're fucked!

00:51:27.013 --> 00:51:34.029
SAM: Yeah, everyone's freaking out and Travis has
reverted back to his behavior as a 15-year-old or

00:51:34.029 --> 00:51:34.982
something.

00:51:34.982 --> 00:51:37.026
LAURA: Travis has been mentally brought back to
that age as well.

00:51:37.026 --> 00:51:39.891
SAM: We're all normal-thinking, but not Travis.

00:51:39.891 --> 00:51:41.876
(laughter)

00:51:41.876 --> 00:51:44.175
LIAM: It's a coping mechanism.

00:51:44.175 --> 00:51:46.858
MATT: You spent far too long roleplaying as Grog,
and it's starting to rub off onto him.

00:51:46.928 --> 00:51:48.114
TRAVIS: Everything's dangerous!

00:51:48.114 --> 00:51:49.451
(laughter)

00:51:49.451 --> 00:51:54.224
ASHLEY: You know what's really cool about this,
though? Okay, I'm going to try to explain this,

00:51:54.224 --> 00:51:57.294
what's happening in my brain, but right now --

00:51:57.294 --> 00:51:58.824
MARISHA: Nah, it's 420. We're cool.

00:51:58.824 --> 00:52:00.375
ASHLEY: Okay. That's true.

00:52:00.375 --> 00:52:01.978
MARISHA: Yeah, we're with it. Yeah.

00:52:01.978 --> 00:52:06.858
ASHLEY: We all have friends right now. Because in
real life, when I was this age, I didn't have

00:52:06.858 --> 00:52:10.455
friends. And now, look, we all have friends!

00:52:10.455 --> 00:52:14.853
MARISHA: Holy shit! Guys, why didn't we know each
other when we were all this age?

00:52:14.853 --> 00:52:16.479
TRAVIS: Because we lived in different states.

00:52:16.479 --> 00:52:17.484
MARISHA: That sucks.

00:52:17.484 --> 00:52:18.632
(laughter)

00:52:18.632 --> 00:52:19.720
LAURA: There's that.

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.172
TALIESIN: A few of us were working all the time.

00:52:21.172 --> 00:52:22.351
SAM: Yeah, I was on Broadway.

00:52:22.351 --> 00:52:23.562
LAURA: Right.

00:52:23.562 --> 00:52:27.209
MATT: Yeah, I didn't have friends. I helped people
with homework and then they said thank you.

00:52:27.209 --> 00:52:28.359
TALIESIN: So nice of you.

00:52:28.359 --> 00:52:32.183
MARISHA: I was covering for friends' drug habits,
so that's fine.

00:52:32.183 --> 00:52:33.347
SAM: Dark.

00:52:33.347 --> 00:52:35.347
TRAVIS: I was melting action figures.

00:52:35.347 --> 00:52:37.697
LAURA: I was in the science club!

00:52:37.697 --> 00:52:40.406
(laughter)

00:52:40.406 --> 00:52:42.124
LAURA: Odyssey of the Mind!

00:52:42.124 --> 00:52:44.912
LIAM: Somewhere in the distance you hear (angry
cat noises)

00:52:44.912 --> 00:52:45.921
LAURA: Oh shit.

00:52:45.921 --> 00:52:46.895
SAM: More cats.

00:52:46.895 --> 00:52:48.426
TRAVIS: Is there a sun?

00:52:48.426 --> 00:52:55.458
LIAM: There is. Definitely, right where you are,
because again the trees opened up, the sky's a

00:52:55.458 --> 00:53:02.378
little dimmer than you're used to. It's got sort
of a dusk feel to it. It's darker, but it's

00:53:02.378 --> 00:53:04.332
day-ish.

00:53:04.332 --> 00:53:08.583
LAURA: How did they get in here? How did you get
in here?

00:53:08.583 --> 00:53:10.501
ASHLEY: Does anybody remember anything?

00:53:10.501 --> 00:53:12.562
LAURA: Does anybody see anything?

00:53:12.562 --> 00:53:16.846
SAM: Yeah, I mean, we were fighting Conan O'Brien
and then we got pushed forward in time. That's all

00:53:16.846 --> 00:53:19.094
I remember. And also, Travis tried to kill me.

00:53:19.094 --> 00:53:20.649
MARISHA: Wait, we got pushed forward in time?

00:53:20.649 --> 00:53:27.293
TALIESIN: Pushed in time? You guys were there!

00:53:27.293 --> 00:53:33.165
MARISHA: We came from the future, though, right?
DM?

00:53:33.165 --> 00:53:34.726
LIAM: Well, I'm not here.

00:53:34.726 --> 00:53:37.164
TRAVIS: No, we saw you, you were there! You rode
in--

00:53:37.164 --> 00:53:38.932
LIAM: You came from the Geek and Sundry offices.

00:53:38.932 --> 00:53:42.206
TRAVIS: We saw you, you rode in on this sweet
Harley and you looked like you were from the Mad

00:53:42.259 --> 00:53:46.317
Max time period and you were all badass. Not like
you look right now.

00:53:46.317 --> 00:53:47.893
LAURA: Like, super badass.

00:53:47.893 --> 00:53:54.898
MARISHA: I mean, it sounds within the realm of
something I'd do, but I don't have any--

00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:56.645
TRAVIS: You don't have a motorcycle parked behind
the--

00:53:56.645 --> 00:53:57.499
LAURA: You don't remember that?

00:53:57.499 --> 00:53:58.439
MARISHA: No.

00:53:58.439 --> 00:53:59.476
TRAVIS: Huh, okay.

00:53:59.476 --> 00:54:01.391
MARISHA: Matt actually said I wasn't allowed to
have a motorcycle.

00:54:01.391 --> 00:54:03.789
MATT: I did say that.

00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:06.815
MARISHA: He's afraid I might kill myself.

00:54:06.815 --> 00:54:09.142
SAM: Well, you will, statistically speaking.

00:54:09.142 --> 00:54:12.435
MATT: Yeah, that's why I said no! She's supposed
to live a long time.

00:54:12.435 --> 00:54:16.856
ASHLEY: Did we actually get together for dinner?
And then we just took drugs for some reason?

00:54:16.856 --> 00:54:17.948
SAM: No.

00:54:17.948 --> 00:54:19.045
TRAVIS: No?

00:54:19.045 --> 00:54:22.772
LAURA: We were recording and then we fought Conan
O'Brien--

00:54:22.772 --> 00:54:24.642
MATT: Guys! Scary creature animal sound--

00:54:24.642 --> 00:54:26.431
SAM: We need weapons, we need somewhere to go.

00:54:26.431 --> 00:54:28.078
LAURA: Did you see anything--

00:54:28.078 --> 00:54:29.272
TRAVIS: Nope!

00:54:29.272 --> 00:54:30.657
ASHLEY: The rock seemed to do well.

00:54:30.657 --> 00:54:32.333
TALIESIN: There was that booming sound earlier.

00:54:32.333 --> 00:54:33.898
MATT: Can I search around? I want to see if
there's anything that could be possibly used as a

00:54:33.898 --> 00:54:34.966
weapon.

00:54:34.966 --> 00:54:36.508
LIAM: Absolutely you can.

00:54:36.508 --> 00:54:39.083
MARISHA: Did you sound like that at that age? Were
you always--

00:54:39.083 --> 00:54:42.499
MATT: What, an obnoxious annoying kid? Yeah,
totally!

00:54:42.499 --> 00:54:47.534
LIAM: There is no shortage of vines and trees and
rocks. If anyone wants to look for something, if

00:54:47.534 --> 00:54:50.070
you want to break it off a tree, they'll be
stronger if you break it right off a tree

00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:51.664
probably, but they're around.

00:54:51.664 --> 00:54:55.878
MARISHA: I'm going to try and break off a sweet
staff from a tree branch.

00:54:55.878 --> 00:55:02.385
LIAM: Well, they're wet and taut.

00:55:02.385 --> 00:55:04.240
TALIESIN: Turgid.

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.720
LIAM: Turgid, yes.

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:11.705
LAURA: I want to break off a few sticks and try to
turn them into sharp daggery sword things. That's

00:55:11.705 --> 00:55:13.087
fine, I'll be covered.

00:55:13.087 --> 00:55:19.758
LIAM: You, Marisha, as you tear down a huge chunk,
are just Carrie'd. Just (squishing noise) as you

00:55:19.758 --> 00:55:27.087
rip it off. When you break, whatever sap or
whatever it is that's in there feels hot and is

00:55:27.087 --> 00:55:30.819
dark red and it spatters you. So you are now
blooded.

00:55:30.819 --> 00:55:32.433
LAURA: Does it smell like blood?

00:55:32.433 --> 00:55:37.364
MARISHA: Is it blood? Yeah, I'm going to smell it
and do a little bit of a taste test.

00:55:37.364 --> 00:55:39.527
LIAM: You want to make a nature check?

00:55:39.527 --> 00:55:40.893
MARISHA: Is that what I do? I don't know!

00:55:40.893 --> 00:55:42.046
LIAM: Sure, why not.

00:55:42.046 --> 00:55:43.589
MARISHA: I'm not a druid in this life!

00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:46.911
LAURA: Yeah, but you know how druids work,
Marisha.

00:55:46.911 --> 00:55:49.500
MARISHA: That's true, right? 15.

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:54.824
LIAM: I mean, you have cut yourself in the past,
you have sucked on a cut, and it does taste kind

00:55:54.824 --> 00:55:58.430
of like that. It is warm.

00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:59.836
LAURA: Is it blood?

00:55:59.836 --> 00:56:02.936
MARISHA: It's warm. It tastes like bad soup.

00:56:02.936 --> 00:56:07.859
MATT: What if everybody else we've ever known was
turned into a tree and we're in a jungle pulling

00:56:08.143 --> 00:56:09.783
their fingers off?

00:56:09.783 --> 00:56:15.272
LIAM: In the direction that you guys have come
from, you hear (fluttering noises).

00:56:15.327 --> 00:56:17.693
SAM: Oh god. I'm going to just grab a handful of
rocks.

00:56:17.693 --> 00:56:18.930
LAURA: I'm going to hide.

00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:21.617
MATT: I'm going to grab Taliesin and wield him as
a weapon.

00:56:21.617 --> 00:56:22.450
TALIESIN: Hey!

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:23.484
LIAM: Are you?

00:56:23.484 --> 00:56:24.667
MATT: Yeah.

00:56:24.667 --> 00:56:27.080
TALIESIN: I'll go with it, and I have the stick,
I'm just going to be like--

00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:31.112
LAURA: I'm going to hide behind the flower that
Matt came out of.

00:56:31.112 --> 00:56:34.030
LIAM: Okay, so you guys are all finding hiding
places?

00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:35.964
MARISHA: Oh, we're hiding?

00:56:35.964 --> 00:56:38.693
MATT: I don't until everyone else starts--

00:56:38.693 --> 00:56:40.170
LIAM: It's getting closer.

00:56:40.170 --> 00:56:41.379
LAURA: I hide.

00:56:41.379 --> 00:56:42.738
LIAM: It's multiple locations, too.

00:56:42.738 --> 00:56:44.171
MARISHA: Can I climb the tree that I broke off?

00:56:44.171 --> 00:56:45.559
LIAM: Sure, make an athletics check.

00:56:45.559 --> 00:56:46.893
MARISHA: Oh jeez.

00:56:46.893 --> 00:56:49.418
LIAM: At disadvantage because it's sopping wet.

00:56:49.418 --> 00:56:51.202
MARISHA: Well, it's a one.

00:56:51.202 --> 00:56:56.295
LIAM: Okay, you slide and fall right back down and
smack your head on a rock and you take one hit

00:56:56.295 --> 00:56:57.585
point of damage.

00:56:57.585 --> 00:57:00.777
MATT: I immediately drop Taliesin and rush over to
make sure she's okay.

00:57:00.777 --> 00:57:02.534
MARISHA: No, don't! I'm fine!

00:57:02.534 --> 00:57:04.592
LIAM: Okay, Taliesin, you take one hit point of
damage as you hit your head

00:57:04.592 --> 00:57:06.105
on a rock on the ground.

00:57:06.105 --> 00:57:08.224
SAM: I'm going to hide in a creek.

00:57:08.224 --> 00:57:10.728
MATT: Just like when I was 12, I can't do anything
right!

00:57:10.728 --> 00:57:13.396
MARISHA: Jesus, don't try to fix it! Just don't
try to fix it!

00:57:13.396 --> 00:57:20.460
LIAM: There is six, seven-- you're hiding? Okay,
make a stealth check.

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:21.900
SAM: I'm hiding, as well.

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:23.278
LIAM: Make a stealth check.

00:57:23.278 --> 00:57:26.354
TALIESIN: You're really enjoying this way too
much.

00:57:26.354 --> 00:57:29.040
LAURA: 22.

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.479
LIAM: 22.

00:57:30.479 --> 00:57:31.497
TALIESIN: Six.

00:57:31.497 --> 00:57:32.627
LIAM: Six?

00:57:32.627 --> 00:57:33.748
SAM: Three.

00:57:33.748 --> 00:57:34.706
LIAM: Three.

00:57:34.706 --> 00:57:37.516
TALIESIN: Which is about what I could get
hired to play at that age.

00:57:37.577 --> 00:57:44.335
LIAM: Okay, you sneak behind, you rogue, you, you
sneak behind the giant plant and get right

00:57:44.335 --> 00:57:49.022
underneath the leaf again, and you reach out and
grab Taliesin and yank him with you. And Sam says,

00:57:49.022 --> 00:57:54.213
"Wait, what about me?" just as these things go
(exploding noise) and break out of the tree cover,

00:57:54.213 --> 00:58:00.858
and there are six or seven of these little ropy
skinless cats, running at you at full speed,

00:58:00.858 --> 00:58:05.560
crossing the water. They're coming. Standing our
ground?

00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:13.289
TRAVIS: I'm fucking out again, just booking ass.
Running like the wind, like Forrest Gump coming

00:58:13.289 --> 00:58:15.189
out of them leg braces!

00:58:15.189 --> 00:58:22.200
LIAM: Taliesin, from your hiding point, you see
Travis just book it in the same direction as the

00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:25.839
weird old man went, running off through the tree
cover, he's gone.

00:58:25.839 --> 00:58:33.328
MATT: As he starts running, can I use Friends to
try and ask him to not leave?

00:58:33.328 --> 00:58:34.475
SAM: You have spells?

00:58:34.475 --> 00:58:35.495
LAURA: Wait, you have spells?

00:58:35.495 --> 00:58:36.718
MARISHA: He's a bard!

00:58:36.718 --> 00:58:39.368
LIAM: You can really implore him to stay, which
means yes.

00:58:39.368 --> 00:58:44.334
MATT: Okay. So I'm going to go ahead-- actually, I
don't have time, since he's going to bolt. Instead

00:58:44.334 --> 00:58:46.260
I'm just going to go ahead and use a persuasion
check.

00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:47.131
LIAM: Okay.

00:58:47.131 --> 00:58:52.045
MATT: I'll try and persuade him. So I say, Travis
don't go, please! You leave now, we all die! We

00:58:52.045 --> 00:59:00.151
need you! Now's the time to become the man you
eventually will be!

00:59:00.151 --> 00:59:03.123
LIAM: Siri, what would we he roll against this?
Wisdom?

00:59:03.123 --> 00:59:05.659
MATT: This would be my persuasion--

00:59:05.659 --> 00:59:08.432
LIAM: Wisdom, right?

00:59:08.432 --> 00:59:10.485
MATT: It's really up to you. If he wants to resist
it, then yeah.

00:59:10.485 --> 00:59:12.157
LIAM: Yeah, let's just go fast and say wisdom.

00:59:12.157 --> 00:59:13.454
MATT: Sure.

00:59:13.454 --> 00:59:16.494
TRAVIS: I'm out.

00:59:16.494 --> 00:59:17.505
MATT: 23.

00:59:17.505 --> 00:59:18.378
TRAVIS: 22.

00:59:18.378 --> 00:59:20.086
ALL: Oh!

00:59:20.086 --> 00:59:24.310
LIAM: You stop and put your hand on the tree
(panting). You breathe, and you stop where you

00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:30.764
are. You're still at this point 40 feet away from
the group and starting to cry. But you don't go.

00:59:30.764 --> 00:59:34.438
You feel too guilty because you spent five years
playing Dungeons and Dragons with these people.

00:59:34.438 --> 00:59:38.043
You cannot leave them alone to die. Everybody roll
for initiative.

00:59:38.043 --> 00:59:40.025
SAM: Oh my god.

00:59:40.025 --> 00:59:42.642
MATT: Oh! Natural 20!

00:59:42.642 --> 00:59:44.090
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:45.381
MARISHA: What?

00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:48.330
MATT: That's crazy! I'm sitting in Taliesin's
seat. I just realized!

00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:49.249
TALIESIN: Damn it!

00:59:49.249 --> 00:59:51.966
LIAM: Okay, who got 15 to 20?

00:59:51.966 --> 00:59:54.855
MARISHA: Hang on, are we rolling initiative?

00:59:54.855 --> 00:59:55.702
LIAM: Yeah, man!

00:59:55.702 --> 00:59:56.920
MARISHA: I got distracted, sorry!

00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:58.132
MATT: Ooh, a 19.

00:59:58.132 --> 01:00:00.089
MARISHA: 22.

01:00:00.089 --> 01:00:01.206
LIAM: 22?

01:00:01.206 --> 01:00:02.262
MATT: 22.

01:00:02.262 --> 01:00:03.455
LIAM: All right. Okay.

01:00:03.455 --> 01:00:04.627
TALIESIN: 19.

01:00:04.627 --> 01:00:06.218
LIAM: 19. Damn, guys.

01:00:06.218 --> 01:00:08.351
TALIESIN: Because of negative one.

01:00:08.351 --> 01:00:10.249
LIAM: All right, ten to 15?

01:00:10.411 --> 01:00:11.673
SAM: 14.

01:00:11.673 --> 01:00:15.596
LIAM: Okay. Laura, Travis, Ashley, where you at?

01:00:15.596 --> 01:00:16.833
LAURA: Five!

01:00:16.833 --> 01:00:17.823
TRAVIS: Four.

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:18.852
ASHLEY: Six!

01:00:18.852 --> 01:00:32.621
LIAM: Okay. All right, these things are-- here we
go. Tree cover! Travis, little boy Travis, has run

01:00:32.621 --> 01:00:44.596
that far. Are we on camera, guys? We've got Laura
and Taliesin-- yeah, that's right. Hidden. Not

01:00:44.596 --> 01:00:51.630
hidden. Standing their ground. It's got to be this
way. Oh, I got it backwards! There we go. And here

01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:53.373
they come, guys.

01:00:53.373 --> 01:00:54.954
SAM: This is it.

01:00:54.954 --> 01:00:58.822
LIAM: (sings) This is just like how I do it with
my kids! And you are kids!

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:05.425
LAURA: Oh my god, there's so many of them, we're
all going to die.

01:01:05.425 --> 01:01:09.200
LIAM: Okay, Marisha. What do you want to do?

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.751
MARISHA: Oh, it's me up first?

01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:11.614
LIAM: Yes.

01:01:11.614 --> 01:01:12.710
SAM: Which one is she?

01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:14.040
LIAM: Marisha's right here.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.007
SAM: Okay.

01:01:15.007 --> 01:01:16.857
LIAM: Yeah, you're not color-coded, so I'll have
to help out a little bit.

01:01:16.857 --> 01:01:24.184
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to turn and I'm going to
look at everybody else, and be like, we're fucking

01:01:24.184 --> 01:01:25.796
up these cats, yeah?

01:01:25.796 --> 01:01:26.555
SAM: Yeah!

01:01:26.555 --> 01:01:27.434
ASHLEY: Yeah!

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:31.722
MARISHA: Okay! And then I'm going to run forward
to the one that's closest to me there.

01:01:31.722 --> 01:01:33.997
LIAM: Three, four, five, six, that's where you're
at.

01:01:33.997 --> 01:01:35.441
MARISHA: That's it? That's all I got?

01:01:35.441 --> 01:01:36.456
LIAM: That's it.

01:01:36.456 --> 01:01:39.930
MARISHA: Okay. And then I'm going to be like,
argh! (crying noises)

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:41.731
LIAM: All righty, you're an angry teen.

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:43.702
MARISHA: I'm angry, all hormonal rage!

01:01:43.702 --> 01:01:45.238
MATT: You still have your action and your bonus.

01:01:45.238 --> 01:01:46.155
LIAM: Yeah.

01:01:46.155 --> 01:01:47.638
MARISHA: I don't have anything I can do, though.

01:01:47.638 --> 01:01:51.426
MATT: Actually, as a monk, you should be able to
use--

01:01:51.426 --> 01:01:52.810
LIAM: At level one.

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:54.001
MATT: At level one--

01:01:54.001 --> 01:01:58.482
MARISHA: I have unarmed strike as a bonus action,
but that's all that's on my sheet.

01:01:58.482 --> 01:02:07.008
MATT: That's true. Oh, I'm sorry, yeah. You can
still use an action if you wanted to go into your

01:02:07.008 --> 01:02:09.446
dodge action, which any attacks against you--

01:02:09.446 --> 01:02:10.616
SAM: No DMing!

01:02:10.616 --> 01:02:11.739
MATT: I'm helping out!

01:02:11.739 --> 01:02:14.636
LIAM: Hey, man, I'm not complaining! Shut up!

01:02:14.636 --> 01:02:17.695
MATT: Anyone can use their action to make a dodge
action, so instead of attacking, you basically

01:02:17.695 --> 01:02:20.540
just get really defensive, and then attacks
against you have disadvantage.

01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:22.447
LIAM: So you're just getting ready for it. That's
a good idea.

01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:25.666
MARISHA: Oh, sure. I'm super ready for these
cats.

01:02:25.666 --> 01:02:34.649
LIAM: Okay. D for dodge! Matt, what would you like
to do? You're right here.

01:02:34.649 --> 01:02:38.469
SAM: He's going to cast 5th-level Explode Cats.

01:02:38.469 --> 01:02:45.871
MATT: I'm going to move ahead, and start getting
closer to back up Marisha. But I'm going to move a

01:02:45.871 --> 01:02:53.123
little bit behind her because she's tougher than I
am. And that one that's kind of off to the right,

01:02:53.123 --> 01:02:59.314
that one right there, I look over as I approach
and be like: Hey cat! Have you seen the kind of

01:02:59.314 --> 01:03:03.605
shit she can do? Oh look, your friend over there,
he went ahead and fell down already. He was twice

01:03:03.605 --> 01:03:06.787
as big as you! You're going to die in a second,
fool! I was going to use

01:03:06.787 --> 01:03:08.432
Vicious Mockery on that guy.

01:03:08.432 --> 01:03:09.250
LIAM: Okay.

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:10.386
SAM: Vicious Mockery.

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:11.415
ASHLEY: Yes!

01:03:11.415 --> 01:03:15.456
MATT: So, let's see. Has to make a wisdom saving
throw.

01:03:15.456 --> 01:03:17.843
LIAM: Okay. What's the DC?

01:03:17.843 --> 01:03:23.078
MATT: It's not on my sheet. But that would be,
with the math there-- proficiency bonus of plus

01:03:23.078 --> 01:03:28.553
two, plus my charisma which is three, so the DC
would be 13.

01:03:28.553 --> 01:03:31.320
LIAM: Well, fuck you, 'cause he got a natural 20.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.933
MATT: That's okay. That happens.

01:03:35.933 --> 01:03:37.579
LIAM: That's okay. Okay.

01:03:37.579 --> 01:03:43.713
MATT: I'm like, mocking cats is a bad idea. Save
me! Can I use the rest of my movement to stand

01:03:43.713 --> 01:03:45.086
directly behind Marisha?

01:03:45.086 --> 01:03:47.291
LIAM: Okay, I'll give you one more. Taliesin,
you're up.

01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:53.124
TALIESIN: I'm going to peek around and see all
this and take a look at what's going down here.

01:03:53.124 --> 01:03:55.669
LIAM: Okay.

01:03:55.669 --> 01:04:03.824
TALIESIN: And the one that's closest to Matt and
Marisha? I have some vague memories of where we

01:04:03.824 --> 01:04:05.051
just came from.

01:04:05.051 --> 01:04:06.118
LIAM: Yeah.

01:04:06.118 --> 01:04:07.934
TALIESIN: I'm going to see if any of this still
works?

01:04:07.934 --> 01:04:08.846
LIAM: Yeah.

01:04:08.846 --> 01:04:10.498
TALIESIN: Do I have any of that weird--

01:04:10.498 --> 01:04:12.244
LIAM: Are you a haunted kid, is that what you're
asking me?

01:04:12.244 --> 01:04:13.487
TALIESIN: I mean, I was already--

01:04:13.487 --> 01:04:15.646
LIAM: You are a fucking haunted kid!

01:04:15.646 --> 01:04:16.891
(laughter)

01:04:16.891 --> 01:04:18.173
LIAM: What do you want to do?

01:04:18.173 --> 01:04:22.756
TALIESIN: I want to reach down into the ground,
and see if I can just-- I'm just going to try and

01:04:22.956 --> 01:04:29.500
reach out at that first cat and see if I can hit
it with a little bit of the Chill Touch. I want to

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.333
see if I can make those tendrils form again.

01:04:32.333 --> 01:04:33.951
LIAM: All right. Talk to me, Goose.

01:04:33.951 --> 01:04:36.383
TALIESIN: Chill Touch on the closest cat to the
two kids.

01:04:36.383 --> 01:04:39.666
LIAM: Okay, this one right here?

01:04:39.666 --> 01:04:41.133
TALIESIN: Yep, that one.

01:04:41.133 --> 01:04:48.692
LIAM: That is definitely within range of your goth
attitude. Okay! So you've got to make a ranged

01:04:48.692 --> 01:04:49.994
spell attack?

01:04:49.994 --> 01:04:51.191
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:04:51.191 --> 01:04:52.536
LIAM: Go for it.

01:04:52.536 --> 01:04:57.023
TALIESIN: I don't actually know how to do this
anymore. Where's my spell--

01:04:57.023 --> 01:04:58.998
LIAM: Plus five, just roll plus five.

01:04:58.998 --> 01:05:00.684
TALIESIN: 18.

01:05:00.684 --> 01:05:07.746
LIAM: 18 does in fact hit, so you slam your little
tiny cherub hand into the ground and it sinks into

01:05:07.746 --> 01:05:14.561
the mud, and you feel the dark power of your
overlord slide down into the ground, and a

01:05:14.561 --> 01:05:18.939
split-second happens, and it goes (electric sound)
out of the ground, underneath this thing, and

01:05:18.939 --> 01:05:24.732
tendrils, spectral purplish-black tendrils wrap
around it and yank it into the ground! And it is

01:05:24.732 --> 01:05:26.136
fucking gone!

01:05:26.136 --> 01:05:27.570
(cheering)

01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:31.650
TALIESIN: (heavy breathing) Cool!

01:05:31.650 --> 01:05:34.928
LIAM: None of you motherfuckers can do what
Taliesin just did. Sam, you're up!

01:05:34.928 --> 01:05:36.598
SAM: Me? Which one am I?

01:05:36.598 --> 01:05:40.509
LIAM: You are in the luchador pants, right here.

01:05:40.509 --> 01:05:45.482
SAM: Okay, I go forward and to the left. Am I
within throwing range?

01:05:45.482 --> 01:05:52.667
LIAM: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50.
For throwing a rock?

01:05:52.667 --> 01:05:56.840
SAM: Yeah. I can hold my action until they get in
range.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:00.054
LIAM: Sure, you want to wait until one gets close
enough, and then chuck a rock?

01:06:00.054 --> 01:06:01.003
SAM: Yes.

01:06:01.003 --> 01:06:02.146
LIAM: Sure. Done.

01:06:02.146 --> 01:06:04.377
SAM: I will get ready. I'll cock my hand.

01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:06.618
LIAM: Cock a rock. Cock rock.

01:06:06.618 --> 01:06:07.654
SAM: Cock rock.

01:06:07.654 --> 01:06:09.132
LIAM: Okay, Ashley. You're up.

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:16.315
ASHLEY: Okay! I'm going to take the dead skinned
cat from my belt and hold it by the tail, and say,

01:06:16.315 --> 01:06:19.854
(shouting) All right, you motherfuckers! You
better turn around and leave or I'm going to kill

01:06:19.854 --> 01:06:24.548
every last motherfucking one of you! I'm going to
intimidate them.

01:06:24.548 --> 01:06:25.844
LIAM: Intimidate, okay.

01:06:25.844 --> 01:06:27.235
SAM: They're cats.

01:06:27.235 --> 01:06:30.829
ASHLEY: (shouting) I don't care if they're just
cats!

01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:34.328
LIAM: Make an intimidation check at disadvantage.

01:06:34.328 --> 01:06:40.176
MATT: This is absolutely brilliant. Ooh! You're
rolling good tonight.

01:06:40.176 --> 01:06:41.512
TRAVIS: Disadvantage.

01:06:41.512 --> 01:06:42.294
LAURA: Why?

01:06:42.294 --> 01:06:43.223
ASHLEY: With a disadvantage?

01:06:43.223 --> 01:06:44.036
LIAM: Yeah.

01:06:44.036 --> 01:06:44.910
ASHLEY: Why?

01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:46.716
LIAM: Because it's a herd of skinless--

01:06:46.716 --> 01:06:47.741
ASHLEY: I'm fucking--

01:06:47.741 --> 01:06:49.376
LAURA: Scary! She's really intimidating!

01:06:49.376 --> 01:06:52.124
MATT: Roll disadvantage, because he said it.

01:06:52.124 --> 01:06:53.789
(laughter)

01:06:53.789 --> 01:06:55.426
SAM: It was a little standoff, there.

01:06:55.426 --> 01:06:58.474
MATT: That's okay. She rolled higher on the second
one.

01:06:58.474 --> 01:07:01.219
ASHLEY: 22.

01:07:01.219 --> 01:07:03.068
TALIESIN: Ooh!

01:07:03.068 --> 01:07:09.834
LIAM: (cats growling) They start backing up.

01:07:09.834 --> 01:07:11.047
SAM: All of them?

01:07:11.047 --> 01:07:20.060
LIAM: Slowly. The first three do. The first three
do stop in their tracks. The other three-- well

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:24.248
you'll find out in a minute. Laura, what would you
like to do?

01:07:24.248 --> 01:07:29.315
LAURA: I'm going to hold my attack until one of
them comes closer.

01:07:29.315 --> 01:07:31.440
LIAM: And how are you going to attack?

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:34.205
LAURA: I have those two sharpened sticks like
daggers, yo!

01:07:34.205 --> 01:07:35.720
LIAM: Are they melee sticks?

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:39.035
LAURA: Well, I mean, I suppose so, because I don't
know how to make a throwing stick.

01:07:39.035 --> 01:07:41.418
LIAM: I think that's just called a stick.

01:07:41.418 --> 01:07:42.414
LAURA: Yeah.

01:07:42.414 --> 01:07:43.405
LIAM: Okay. All right.

01:07:43.405 --> 01:07:45.828
LAURA: But I want it to be sharp, I don't want to
just throw a stick at something.

01:07:45.828 --> 01:07:50.096
LIAM: Okay. Are you waiting until they're in
throwing range or until they're right up on you?

01:07:50.096 --> 01:07:52.478
LAURA: No, I want to wait until--

01:07:52.478 --> 01:07:54.078
SAM: Where are you?

01:07:54.078 --> 01:07:56.278
LAURA: I'm under a leaf. We're hiding.

01:07:56.278 --> 01:07:58.489
SAM: Oh, that's not going to get near you in the
next round.

01:07:58.489 --> 01:08:01.094
LAURA: They're not?

01:08:01.094 --> 01:08:03.836
SAM: You're a hundred feet away from them.

01:08:03.836 --> 01:08:09.193
LAURA: Well, fine, I'll run out there and back up
Ashley. I'll go stand next to Ashley.

01:08:09.193 --> 01:08:12.151
LIAM: 30, 40, bust out-- okay, right there, boom.

01:08:12.151 --> 01:08:16.834
LAURA: And then I'll pull my sticks out and wait.
And wait until they get closer.

01:08:16.834 --> 01:08:22.681
LIAM: Okay. Travis, would you like to keep--- oh
no, you were convinced to run. Do you want to stay

01:08:22.681 --> 01:08:24.691
hiding here? Or do you want to go back?

01:08:24.691 --> 01:08:26.357
TRAVIS: Nah, I'll go back. I was convinced.

01:08:26.357 --> 01:08:29.015
LAURA: I've been shamed by Sam to come out of
fucking hiding.

01:08:29.015 --> 01:08:33.154
LIAM: So, just direct line back? And you can dash,
too, I mean you're way far back.

01:08:33.154 --> 01:08:35.128
LAURA: I've only got six health points right now,
bro.

01:08:35.128 --> 01:08:36.689
LIAM: You want to dash?

01:08:36.689 --> 01:08:44.400
TRAVIS: No. I'm going to use my action to reach in
and grab what is definitely all-white

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:48.647
tighty-whiteys, and I'm going to rip the elastic
band off of my briefs--

01:08:48.647 --> 01:08:50.097
MARISHA: Oh yeah!

01:08:50.097 --> 01:08:51.717
LAURA: Are you going to rage?

01:08:51.717 --> 01:08:57.394
TRAVIS: I'm going to pull the elastic band off and
prepare to, I don't know. (laughs)

01:08:57.394 --> 01:08:58.500
SAM: To strangle?

01:08:58.500 --> 01:08:59.944
TRAVIS: Yes, to strangle.

01:08:59.944 --> 01:09:04.987
LIAM: Chances are so small, but I want you to roll
just in case you get a one.

01:09:04.987 --> 01:09:08.505
TRAVIS: It's a 12.

01:09:08.505 --> 01:09:12.777
LIAM: Those tighty-whiteys rip out of your hands
and you crouch down, and you've got like a piano

01:09:12.777 --> 01:09:20.519
wire, except it's your underwear. And you're
ready. Okay. So these three don't leave, but they

01:09:20.519 --> 01:09:27.711
back up to about here. They're still barely past
the edge of the tree. These ones are still coming,

01:09:27.711 --> 01:09:34.125
they didn't give a shit. One, two, three, four,
five, six, and he's going to dash and get right up

01:09:34.125 --> 01:09:35.257
on you--

01:09:35.257 --> 01:09:37.060
SAM: Is that within throwing range for me?

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:37.947
LIAM: Yes.

01:09:37.947 --> 01:09:38.881
SAM: I'm throwing!

01:09:38.881 --> 01:09:40.977
LIAM: All right, throw! Make a ranged attack.

01:09:40.977 --> 01:09:42.089
SAM: One.

01:09:42.089 --> 01:09:43.718
(laughter)

01:09:43.718 --> 01:09:46.695
SAM: Oh no, do I hit Marisha, or something?

01:09:46.695 --> 01:09:50.473
LIAM: You do, actually. It conks off the back of
your head--

01:09:50.473 --> 01:09:52.611
MARISHA: Ow.

01:09:52.611 --> 01:09:53.732
SAM: Sorry!

01:09:53.732 --> 01:09:57.155
LIAM: Roll a d4.

01:09:57.155 --> 01:09:58.452
MARISHA: You are!

01:09:58.452 --> 01:10:01.327
SAM: Three.

01:10:01.327 --> 01:10:03.097
LIAM: Three? What's your strength modifier?

01:10:03.097 --> 01:10:06.634
SAM: I don't know. Oh, one.

01:10:06.634 --> 01:10:11.222
LIAM: One, okay. You take four points of damage.
You are clocked hard.

01:10:11.222 --> 01:10:14.570
MARISHA: Damn it! Dick!

01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:16.307
SAM: I'm sorry!

01:10:16.307 --> 01:10:17.491
MARISHA: Fucking hell!

01:10:17.491 --> 01:10:20.244
SAM: I'm a musical theater person!

01:10:20.244 --> 01:10:23.431
MARISHA: My mom warned me about people like you!

01:10:23.431 --> 01:10:28.833
LIAM: These are just going for the closest victim
they can find, but they're not close enough to actually

01:10:28.833 --> 01:10:35.793
attack. They make it up to there, they are
rounding on Marisha, and now it's Marisha's turn.

01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:39.977
MARISHA: Jesus, so I've got two kitty cats on me?

01:10:39.977 --> 01:10:41.131
LIAM: Three.

01:10:41.131 --> 01:10:42.315
MARISHA: Three kitty cats?

01:10:42.315 --> 01:10:44.284
LAURA: They're really mean, Marisha! They have
claws!

01:10:44.284 --> 01:10:52.395
MARISHA: Ugh! What? This is why you spay and
neuter your pets! And then I kick the one directly

01:10:52.395 --> 01:10:53.703
in front of me.

01:10:53.703 --> 01:10:54.783
LIAM: Okay.

01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:56.516
MARISHA: Do I get a multiattack as a monk?

01:10:56.516 --> 01:10:58.334
LIAM: You get two attacks as a monk, yeah.

01:10:58.334 --> 01:11:02.448
MARISHA: I get two? Okay, I'm going to kick the
first one, just full on punt him, then I'm going

01:11:02.612 --> 01:11:05.904
to take the stick with the second one and give him
a big old golf swing.

01:11:05.976 --> 01:11:07.871
LIAM: Okay, roll two attacks.

01:11:07.871 --> 01:11:09.289
MARISHA: All right.

01:11:09.289 --> 01:11:11.294
MATT: See what's the first one, in case you kill
it.

01:11:11.294 --> 01:11:16.464
MARISHA: First one? That's not great. 14 for the
first one.

01:11:16.464 --> 01:11:18.613
LIAM: This is the kick? Roll a d4.

01:11:18.613 --> 01:11:23.887
MARISHA: One plus three. Four points.

01:11:23.887 --> 01:11:28.976
LIAM: Okay, your foot takes this thing under the
chin and you just slick the bottom of your shoe

01:11:29.048 --> 01:11:36.694
and you feel a snap in your foot and it just does
a spin in the air and lands on its back, dead. But

01:11:36.694 --> 01:11:39.697
you're still moving and smacking the next one.

01:11:39.697 --> 01:11:46.663
MARISHA: Golf swing! Which is-- ooh, that's good,
that's 15 plus-- 21.

01:11:46.663 --> 01:11:50.158
LIAM: Definitely hits. d4 plus strength.

01:11:50.158 --> 01:11:51.910
MARISHA: Five, total.

01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:57.991
LIAM: Okay, and you swing away and go crack and
this time you hit the thing's fucking head so hard

01:11:57.991 --> 01:12:02.567
that you hear the same kind of snap, except you
feel tendon rip at the same time, and the head

01:12:02.567 --> 01:12:07.929
goes free except for this thin little band of
ligament, and it just falls and is still twitching

01:12:07.929 --> 01:12:10.046
and going (whimpering noises)

01:12:10.046 --> 01:12:13.718
MATT: The first hit, behind her I go, nice! Second
one I go, no!

01:12:13.718 --> 01:12:15.699
MARISHA: I feel guilty.

01:12:15.699 --> 01:12:24.861
LIAM: Matt, you're up. And you've got a direct
view of blood dripping out the back of your young

01:12:24.861 --> 01:12:26.733
fiancée's head.

01:12:26.733 --> 01:12:35.007
MATT: Ooh, that's right. Well, there's the one
still next to her. All right, you know what, I'm

01:12:35.077 --> 01:12:47.063
going to go ahead and say: Don't worry, baby, I'll
take care of you! In about ten years! Or right

01:12:47.063 --> 01:12:49.683
now. We'll do that now! Healing Word.

01:12:49.683 --> 01:12:51.296
LIAM: Okay.

01:12:51.296 --> 01:12:54.217
MATT: Bonus action, so you heal five hit points.

01:12:54.217 --> 01:12:56.058
ALL: Hey!

01:12:56.058 --> 01:13:02.148
LIAM: Ugh, the back of your head stops smarting
like Advil, pronto, all healed up.

01:13:02.148 --> 01:13:07.633
MARISHA: Man, you're so calming, just your
presence. So good.

01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:08.994
MATT: Thanks!

01:13:08.994 --> 01:13:10.157
MARISHA: In ten years.

01:13:10.157 --> 01:13:12.733
MATT: I look over at the cat. As she's saying
this, the cat is in front of her going (snarling

01:13:12.733 --> 01:13:15.264
noise). Okay, we're dead!

01:13:15.264 --> 01:13:17.056
LIAM: (cat yowling)

01:13:17.056 --> 01:13:20.589
MATT: I'm going to walk up and try and do what she
did, try and kick at it.

01:13:20.589 --> 01:13:22.751
LIAM: Kick it? Okay, go for a roll.

01:13:22.751 --> 01:13:29.076
MATT: I move up base to base, right against her
shoulder, and just, (screams). Screaming, probably

01:13:29.076 --> 01:13:36.838
think I'm going to hurt myself more than the
creature, trying. And that is a four.

01:13:36.838 --> 01:13:46.242
LIAM: You do the most beautiful martial arts movie
spin kick that hits absolutely nothing, and come

01:13:46.242 --> 01:13:51.402
back down and breathe heavy (panting) and look
over at the love of your life. Yeah.

01:13:51.402 --> 01:13:53.651
MATT: I'm proud of myself, because that looks just
like it does when I practice it

01:13:53.651 --> 01:13:55.579
when I'm home alone.

01:13:55.579 --> 01:14:00.771
LIAM: Executive, you're up.

01:14:00.771 --> 01:14:05.291
TALIESIN: I see this one that's threatening. I'm
going to try and get a little more fancy with

01:14:05.291 --> 01:14:08.346
this. I'm just going to see if I can manifest the
power inside the cat.

01:14:08.346 --> 01:14:10.039
LIAM: Inside the cat? Sure, go for it.

01:14:10.039 --> 01:14:15.901
TALIESIN: Yeah. Shooting, going for inside the
cat. It's already gross. That's right, I've got to

01:14:15.901 --> 01:14:18.184
learn this. 22.

01:14:18.184 --> 01:14:24.309
LIAM: Okay, so as Matt's foot comes down into the
water and goes (panting) you're right face-to-face

01:14:24.309 --> 01:14:30.264
with the thing. Its feral face is leaning up
against yours and it goes (yowls) and then three

01:14:30.264 --> 01:14:36.676
spectral octopus tentacles come out of its face,
one out of each eye and one of its mouth, and you

01:14:36.676 --> 01:14:44.597
feel that shit just slathering all over your face
and sucks back in and the thing just explodes like

01:14:44.597 --> 01:14:48.087
a blood sausage. Gone.

01:14:48.087 --> 01:14:49.637
TALIESIN: Ooh. Okay.

01:14:49.637 --> 01:14:55.186
MATT: When I turn around and see this tiny bowl
haircut blond kid from the Omen just glowing.

01:14:55.186 --> 01:14:59.653
LIAM: You look over your shoulder and you just see
that face.

01:14:59.653 --> 01:15:03.400
MATT: Marisha, who are we fighting? I don't know
who we're fighting anymore!

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.283
TALIESIN: We're good, we got this!

01:15:05.283 --> 01:15:06.297
MATT: Okay!

01:15:06.297 --> 01:15:07.663
MARISHA: That's Taliesin!

01:15:07.663 --> 01:15:09.214
LIAM: Sam, what would you like to do?

01:15:09.214 --> 01:15:11.597
SAM: It's my turn? Oh, it's my turn again. We've
cycled around?

01:15:11.597 --> 01:15:12.977
LIAM: Yep.

01:15:12.977 --> 01:15:16.630
SAM: Okay. Are those guys out of range?

01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:19.727
LIAM: Just, but you could get in range.

01:15:19.727 --> 01:15:24.679
SAM: All right, I'm going to try to right my
wrongs and get in range and throw another rock at

01:15:24.679 --> 01:15:26.890
the middle one.

01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:29.334
LIAM: The middle one? Okay. Looks good.

01:15:29.334 --> 01:15:33.489
SAM: For Bixby! Two.

01:15:33.489 --> 01:15:36.074
(laughter)

01:15:36.074 --> 01:15:39.161
LIAM: Would you like to use the rest of your
movement? You could back up a little bit,

01:15:39.161 --> 01:15:40.237
I guess.

01:15:40.237 --> 01:15:45.978
SAM: Yeah. Is there anything I can hide behind? Is
that a thing?

01:15:45.978 --> 01:15:50.088
LIAM: No, the closest cover of any kind is 50 feet
away.

01:15:50.088 --> 01:15:53.433
SAM: And they're going to get me. I'll just go
huddle with Marisha and Matt.

01:15:53.433 --> 01:15:58.532
LIAM: Okay. Okay, there you are, a little chorus
line. Ashley, you're up.

01:15:58.532 --> 01:16:11.409
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll walk up alongside the four of
them, just swinging the corpse. It's your call!

01:16:11.409 --> 01:16:19.296
You want to run, or you want to keep fighting?
Four of you down! Five, actually! Math wasn't my

01:16:19.296 --> 01:16:21.267
strong suit!

01:16:21.267 --> 01:16:25.597
LIAM: Laura, you're watching rebel teen Ashley
mouth off at some skinless cats. What would you

01:16:25.597 --> 01:16:26.961
like to do?

01:16:26.961 --> 01:16:34.350
LAURA: I'm going to stand, walk around them--

01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:36.407
LIAM: To this side?

01:16:36.407 --> 01:16:39.571
LAURA: Yeah, but back. Just stay behind them.

01:16:39.571 --> 01:16:40.828
LIAM: Here?

01:16:40.828 --> 01:16:41.831
LAURA: Back further.

01:16:41.831 --> 01:16:42.804
LIAM: Here.

01:16:42.804 --> 01:16:43.632
LAURA: Further.

01:16:43.632 --> 01:16:44.496
LIAM: Okay.

01:16:44.496 --> 01:16:50.264
LAURA: Yeah. Basically, I walk over so I can see.
And I ready my sticks, and I'm going to save my

01:16:50.264 --> 01:16:51.318
action.

01:16:51.318 --> 01:16:53.361
LIAM: Sure. You can do that.

01:16:53.361 --> 01:16:55.520
SAM: Stick! Stick! Stick!

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.762
LIAM: All right, Travis. What's up?

01:16:57.762 --> 01:17:01.342
TRAVIS: I'll use my dash to try and join the other
crew.

01:17:01.342 --> 01:17:03.707
LIAM: Aw, look at that.

01:17:03.707 --> 01:17:04.994
TRAVIS: Look at that.

01:17:04.994 --> 01:17:08.000
LIAM: Awkward. Okay.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.055
MATT: Sweat just pouring down his face.

01:17:10.055 --> 01:17:18.084
TRAVIS: (heavy breathing) My asthma is a problem
at this point. My Ventolin inhaler is broken.

01:17:18.084 --> 01:17:23.175
MATT: We are straight-up the kids from It right
now, by the way.

01:17:23.175 --> 01:17:33.008
LIAM: Oh yeah. (bell ding) The three cats continue
to-- well, they don't bristle, because they have

01:17:33.008 --> 01:17:41.149
no hair. They're still backing up. They move
backward into the tree cover, but you see them

01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:47.500
stop. They don't flee. They get into the trees and
they sit and stare.

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:51.903
LAURA: We should probably get out of here before
more cats come.

01:17:51.903 --> 01:17:54.282
TRAVIS: I think they did that because something
bigger's coming.

01:17:54.282 --> 01:17:57.549
LAURA: I think they did it because Ashley's
fucking scary as shit!

01:17:57.549 --> 01:17:59.708
TALIESIN: There was an old man when we got here
before.

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:01.976
LAURA: You're really cool, Ashley.

01:18:01.976 --> 01:18:03.788
TALIESIN: Yeah, that was pretty cool.

01:18:03.788 --> 01:18:07.426
MARISHA: Ashley and I just, football, huh! Huh!
And then we do the chest

01:18:07.426 --> 01:18:09.636
bump thing in the air. Huh!

01:18:09.636 --> 01:18:11.585
LIAM: And whatever this stuff is goes (squishing)
between you.

01:18:11.585 --> 01:18:12.999
ALL: Ugh.

01:18:12.999 --> 01:18:19.429
MATT: Which me, being two feet away, (splashing
noise). That's still pretty cool.

01:18:19.429 --> 01:18:21.024
TRAVIS: We saw an old guy.

01:18:21.024 --> 01:18:22.847
LAURA: Oh wait, what?

01:18:22.847 --> 01:18:25.849
TRAVIS: Yeah, we saw an old man, he was trying to
peel you out of the tomato plant you were in.

01:18:25.849 --> 01:18:27.560
SAM: Which way did he go?

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:28.866
TRAVIS: I have no idea.

01:18:28.866 --> 01:18:31.844
TALIESIN: He went that way. That way, now.

01:18:31.844 --> 01:18:33.312
ASHLEY: Can anybody track?

01:18:33.312 --> 01:18:38.166
SAM: Let's go! I'm pretty good at that, at
tracking, I think.

01:18:38.166 --> 01:18:39.170
LIAM: Are you?

01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:40.883
SAM: I don't know, I'm a ranger. Isn't that what
rangers do?

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:41.896
LIAM: Well, you're Sam.

01:18:41.896 --> 01:18:42.924
SAM: Oh shit.

01:18:42.924 --> 01:18:44.227
LIAM: Give it a shot.

01:18:44.227 --> 01:18:47.209
SAM: I had a treehouse in the woods growing up.

01:18:47.209 --> 01:18:48.565
TRAVIS: Did you really?

01:18:48.565 --> 01:18:50.402
TALIESIN: That's come up so many times today!

01:18:50.402 --> 01:18:52.014
LAURA: Okay, well, try to find the fucking old
guy!

01:18:52.014 --> 01:18:55.361
SAM: I mean, it was right behind my house.

01:18:55.422 --> 01:18:59.160
MATT: He spent a long time trying to keep away
from old guys in the woods, so he knows how to

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.626
track them well.

01:19:00.626 --> 01:19:03.081
LIAM: I'm going to give you, if you want to-- do
you want to track?

01:19:03.081 --> 01:19:04.042
SAM: Yeah!

01:19:04.042 --> 01:19:06.356
LIAM: All right, make a perception, right?

01:19:06.356 --> 01:19:07.794
MATT: Tracking would be survival.

01:19:07.794 --> 01:19:13.726
LIAM: Survival, that's what I was going to say.
But, for reasons, do it at advantage.

01:19:13.726 --> 01:19:14.723
SAM: Because--

01:19:14.723 --> 01:19:15.832
MATT: Because you're awesome!

01:19:15.832 --> 01:19:17.093
TRAVIS: Because you love this.

01:19:17.093 --> 01:19:19.453
SAM: Because I'm a ranger and rangers get
advantage in their favorite terrain.

01:19:19.453 --> 01:19:20.421
LIAM: Wrong.

01:19:20.421 --> 01:19:23.486
LAURA: Maybe because he knows you know the old
guy.

01:19:23.486 --> 01:19:24.611
SAM: Okay.

01:19:24.611 --> 01:19:26.510
TALIESIN: Because Warner Bros is your favored
terrain?

01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:27.500
SAM: 13.

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:35.405
LIAM: That's fine. You see where Verno booked it
before. You can see Verno went through the trees

01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:43.092
right here, but you see another break. You see a
vine split off right there, and you gather that he

01:19:43.092 --> 01:19:46.240
went in generally the same direction, not exactly,
where Travis went.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.455
SAM: I think he's that way.

01:19:48.455 --> 01:19:50.071
LAURA: Well, let's go find him.

01:19:50.071 --> 01:19:51.663
SAM: Follow me, everyone.

01:19:51.663 --> 01:19:56.290
LIAM: And this little seven-year-old boy with a
gigantic smile starts stalking his way through the

01:19:56.290 --> 01:19:58.192
bog and leading you.

01:19:58.192 --> 01:20:02.601
(laughter)

01:20:02.601 --> 01:20:04.972
MARISHA: So cute!

01:20:04.972 --> 01:20:06.735
SAM: I didn't shower much.

01:20:06.735 --> 01:20:09.102
LAURA: So cute.

01:20:09.102 --> 01:20:12.746
LIAM: Everybody's following Ranger Sam, right?

01:20:12.746 --> 01:20:13.562
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:20:13.562 --> 01:20:14.609
TALIESIN: Sure.

01:20:14.609 --> 01:20:15.775
LIAM: Okay. All right. So.

01:20:15.775 --> 01:20:18.694
MATT: Trying to clean my perpetually fogging
glasses because of the humid weather.

01:20:18.694 --> 01:20:25.693
LIAM: Yeah, it's like every 30 seconds here. So
you guys start walking, and after the first

01:20:25.693 --> 01:20:32.286
minute, you notice as you're going, Sam, in the
ground, something very different than anything

01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:38.722
else you've seen here. There's a long bar in the
ground, half sunken into the ground, and covered

01:20:38.722 --> 01:20:44.307
over. You only saw a glint of yellow, and it was
faded over and mucky, but you saw it. It looked

01:20:44.307 --> 01:20:50.015
very different. Leaning down, you wipe away some
of the crap covering it, and you see sort of an

01:20:50.015 --> 01:20:58.434
alternating yellow, black pattern. It's like a
long board. It's old, and it's wet and rotted

01:20:58.434 --> 01:21:05.687
through, but there's no mistaking one of those
things for gate entry.

01:21:05.687 --> 01:21:11.978
SAM: Oh, parking lot entry gate. Wait, does that
mean we're in an old overgrown parking lot? I'm

01:21:11.978 --> 01:21:17.495
going to dig it out. Or I'll try.

01:21:17.495 --> 01:21:21.633
LIAM: Okay. You don't even need to make any kind
of a check. Everything is so slick here, it just

01:21:21.633 --> 01:21:28.298
slides out. You can't lift the whole thing or hold
the whole thing because it's eight feet long. As

01:21:28.298 --> 01:21:35.901
you pull it out, it's so soft, it breaks at one
spot, but there's no question what that is. This

01:21:35.901 --> 01:21:40.309
is exactly a gate entry bar.

01:21:40.309 --> 01:21:46.333
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a wild guess. I'm
going to see if there's a little boxhouse nearby.

01:21:46.333 --> 01:21:48.221
MARISHA: Yeah, can I assist him on that?

01:21:48.221 --> 01:21:49.221
LIAM: Sure.

01:21:49.221 --> 01:21:50.976
TALIESIN: Where it would be, physically. I'm
getting a sneaky suspicion--

01:21:50.976 --> 01:21:52.486
LIAM: Make an investigation check.

01:21:52.486 --> 01:21:55.313
LAURA: Can you turn that stick into a weapon?

01:21:55.313 --> 01:21:57.018
TALIESIN: Investigation?

01:21:57.018 --> 01:21:57.999
LIAM: Yeah.

01:21:57.999 --> 01:21:59.193
TALIESIN: Nine.

01:21:59.193 --> 01:22:00.591
MARISHA: 13.

01:22:00.591 --> 01:22:07.696
LIAM: Nine? 13? Yeah, I mean, you've been to
Warner Bros.

01:22:07.696 --> 01:22:11.153
TALIESIN: Yeah. We're still on the WB lot.

01:22:11.153 --> 01:22:16.591
SAM: Those four posts were the tower! What was
left of it.

01:22:16.591 --> 01:22:21.228
LAURA: What does that even mean? How do we get
home?

01:22:21.228 --> 01:22:23.653
SAM: Well, we're in Burbank.

01:22:23.653 --> 01:22:25.562
(laughter)

01:22:25.562 --> 01:22:28.563
TALIESIN: Just several miles down the 405 ought to
do it.

01:22:28.563 --> 01:22:30.234
TRAVIS: Should I say it?

01:22:30.234 --> 01:22:31.765
TALIESIN: Do you want to say it?

01:22:31.765 --> 01:22:32.897
SAM: Say what?

01:22:32.897 --> 01:22:34.250
TALIESIN: You thought it, you might as well say
it.

01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:35.614
TRAVIS: I have a theory about where we are.

01:22:35.614 --> 01:22:37.461
SAM: Well, we're at Warner Brothers.

01:22:37.461 --> 01:22:39.777
TRAVIS: I feel like we're in the Upside-Down.

01:22:39.777 --> 01:22:43.959
MARISHA: Of life, or WB?

01:22:43.959 --> 01:22:44.965
TRAVIS: Both.

01:22:44.965 --> 01:22:47.337
ASHLEY: What?

01:22:47.337 --> 01:22:49.551
TALIESIN: We're in the BW.

01:22:49.551 --> 01:22:54.418
(laughter)

01:22:54.418 --> 01:22:56.745
LIAM: What do you guys want to do?

01:22:56.745 --> 01:23:03.527
SAM: Well, wait, if these are security booths
here, maybe they have some handcuffs or something

01:23:03.527 --> 01:23:05.007
that we can get in there.

01:23:05.007 --> 01:23:07.770
TRAVIS: Are there any working flashlights in the
security booth?

01:23:07.770 --> 01:23:10.590
LIAM: You can make an investigation check. You
didn't find anything.

01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:13.113
TALIESIN: I'm going to join you, just rummaging
through.

01:23:13.113 --> 01:23:17.269
LIAM: Go for it. You're digging through rot.

01:23:17.269 --> 01:23:18.420
TRAVIS: 13.

01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:20.790
TALIESIN: 20.

01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:22.480
LIAM: Natural 20?

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:24.026
TALIESIN: No, just 20.

01:23:24.026 --> 01:23:31.665
LIAM: Okay. You dig, and you do find the
foundation of-- it's Hollywood Way. It's the exact

01:23:31.665 --> 01:23:37.937
setup for that little booth when you're going into
park, right under the tower. I mean, you haven't

01:23:37.937 --> 01:23:45.729
traveled that far, right? And there's nothing in
here. The bottom of the structure, the walls is

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:52.821
there, you can tell where the bottom of the door,
the lintel? Is it the lintel? I don't know.

01:23:52.821 --> 01:23:54.592
SAM: Sure, why not.

01:23:54.592 --> 01:23:57.509
LIAM: You found the gate post, and that's all you
found, there's no--

01:23:57.509 --> 01:23:59.260
ASHLEY: There's no walls in the thing.

01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:02.965
LIAM: No, it's just the bottom of the structure.
You can just barely make out one corner.

01:24:02.965 --> 01:24:08.378
TALIESIN: Does it feel like some of the buildings
might still be there, hidden in this forest

01:24:08.378 --> 01:24:10.811
structure, or is it just too dense?

01:24:10.811 --> 01:24:12.575
LIAM: You didn't see anything.

01:24:12.575 --> 01:24:18.254
MARISHA: Can I backtrack, now that we're slowly
piecing this together, see if I can find the

01:24:18.254 --> 01:24:21.272
Hollywood Way sign? The street sign?

01:24:21.272 --> 01:24:22.673
LIAM: Sure?

01:24:22.673 --> 01:24:24.451
TALIESIN: Don't wander too far.

01:24:24.451 --> 01:24:27.551
MARISHA: No, I just want to turn around, if it's
right there.

01:24:27.551 --> 01:24:43.311
LIAM: You guys here, that way maybe was the tower,
about here's where you find the security gate, I

01:24:43.311 --> 01:24:46.713
guess, and old feller ran that way.

01:24:46.713 --> 01:24:49.363
LAURA: (gasps) We should head towards Geek and
Sundry!

01:24:49.363 --> 01:24:55.876
MARISHA: He went north? Is he going north on
Hollywood Way? I rolled a ten total.

01:24:55.876 --> 01:24:57.923
LIAM: To find a sign?

01:24:57.923 --> 01:24:59.465
MARISHA: Hollywood Way.

01:24:59.465 --> 01:25:00.983
LIAM: No, man.

01:25:00.983 --> 01:25:04.297
SAM: Yeah, but we know the direction. We know
where the tower is. We know where the booth is. We

01:25:04.297 --> 01:25:05.556
just go that way.

01:25:05.556 --> 01:25:06.960
LAURA: Keep following the guy.

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:08.436
MATT: The guy was pretty old?

01:25:08.436 --> 01:25:10.400
TRAVIS: He was super old. He was old and weak.

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.480
LIAM: You saw a glint of glasses, too.

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:14.286
TRAVIS: He had a glint of glasses.

01:25:14.286 --> 01:25:18.437
MATT: If we keep going, we can probably catch up
to him because he's probably not very fast.

01:25:18.437 --> 01:25:20.787
SAM: You're a very smart young man.

01:25:20.787 --> 01:25:22.408
MATT: That's all I got.

01:25:22.408 --> 01:25:27.649
MARISHA: I didn't see anything! What if this is
just a Warner Bros specific thing? What if the

01:25:27.649 --> 01:25:29.404
rest of LA is okay?

01:25:29.404 --> 01:25:32.757
SAM: I mean, we can see into LA and it's not,
right?

01:25:32.757 --> 01:25:36.113
LAURA: Yeah, I climbed to the top of the tower.
It's jungle everywhere.

01:25:36.113 --> 01:25:40.113
LIAM: If you can believe your eyes, San Fernando
Valley is this way.

01:25:40.113 --> 01:25:42.566
MATT: Is this the future we're looking at?

01:25:42.566 --> 01:25:48.569
MARISHA: But, jungle versus Warner Bros sinking.
Is it everything?

01:25:48.569 --> 01:25:50.879
SAM: We've got one option: we've got to follow
this old guy!

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:52.375
LAURA: Let's follow the old guy!

01:25:52.375 --> 01:25:54.361
ASHLEY: When you climbed up to the top, you didn't
see any structures?

01:25:54.361 --> 01:25:55.925
LAURA: No, all I saw was jungle.

01:25:55.925 --> 01:25:57.348
ASHLEY: Shit!

01:25:57.348 --> 01:26:01.506
MARISHA: Look, it's the Valley, there's not a lot
of skyscrapers.

01:26:01.506 --> 01:26:04.164
LAURA: I mean it's a jungle here. It's a desert,
really.

01:26:04.164 --> 01:26:06.131
TRAVIS: Let's try to go after the old guy.

01:26:06.131 --> 01:26:11.956
LAURA: They're not normal trees. They look like
engorged sausages.

01:26:11.956 --> 01:26:16.991
ASHLEY: Wet Bulging Sausages. Warner Bros
Studios.

01:26:16.991 --> 01:26:18.513
MARISHA: Turgid, engorged--

01:26:18.513 --> 01:26:20.459
ASHLEY: There's a lot that's going on right now.

01:26:20.459 --> 01:26:25.881
MATT: I start getting a nosebleed. Well, if
there's any building in this vicinity that lasts

01:26:25.881 --> 01:26:28.314
through time, it's the Bob's Big Boy.

01:26:28.314 --> 01:26:29.438
TRAVIS: It's true.

01:26:29.438 --> 01:26:30.588
ASHLEY: That's true.

01:26:30.588 --> 01:26:32.771
SAM: Why are we going to Bob's Big Boy?! Didn't he
go north on Hollywood Way?

01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:41.390
LIAM: He did. If you can believe your eyes, if
this nonsense is actually based on anything, then

01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:43.179
yes, he is heading along Hollywood Way.

01:26:43.179 --> 01:26:44.939
TALIESIN: We're going down Hollywood Way.

01:26:44.939 --> 01:26:53.094
LIAM: Okay. All right, so Ranger Sam leads the
way. You guys start traveling. It's slow-going

01:26:53.094 --> 01:26:57.499
because it's wet and disgusting and there's trees
everywhere. You're going through fucking swamp.

01:26:57.499 --> 01:27:01.369
LAURA: As we go, we should keep our eyes out for
anything that we can use as weapons.

01:27:01.369 --> 01:27:04.614
LIAM: There's lots of vines and rocks and sticks.

01:27:04.614 --> 01:27:06.130
LAURA: There's nothing metal?

01:27:06.130 --> 01:27:07.761
SAM: Just Ashley.

01:27:07.761 --> 01:27:14.287
LIAM: The last metal you saw was Ashley Johnson
and what is presumably the base of the Warner Bros

01:27:14.287 --> 01:27:15.346
water tower.

01:27:15.346 --> 01:27:21.394
ASHLEY: Can I, as we walk, with my handy-dandy
tools that are here that I see that you've added.

01:27:21.394 --> 01:27:25.053
Can I start trying to fashion a slingshot?

01:27:25.053 --> 01:27:26.761
LIAM: Out of cat gut?

01:27:26.761 --> 01:27:28.573
ASHLEY: Yeah!

01:27:28.573 --> 01:27:29.713
LIAM: Sure.

01:27:29.713 --> 01:27:34.343
ASHLEY: Out of a nice little twig. Travis can
attest I'm pretty good with slingshots.

01:27:34.584 --> 01:27:36.739
LIAM: Make a survival check.

01:27:36.739 --> 01:27:43.363
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:46.331
SAM: What are you, Ashley?

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:49.422
ASHLEY: That's a seven, right?

01:27:49.422 --> 01:27:51.064
MATT: Yeah.

01:27:51.064 --> 01:27:52.602
MARISHA: She's Ashley.

01:27:52.602 --> 01:27:53.786
ASHLEY: 11.

01:27:53.786 --> 01:27:59.591
LIAM: 11? Okay. So, what you're able to do as
you're walking is to pull and rip away some of the

01:27:59.591 --> 01:28:08.025
leg tendon from this thing's body. And now you've
got this stretchy piece of meat to work with.

01:28:08.025 --> 01:28:09.453
MATT: (whispering) That's so cool!

01:28:09.453 --> 01:28:13.313
LIAM: More on that later. You guys continue to
walk through the jungle and you're noticing that

01:28:13.313 --> 01:28:15.517
the ground is moving downward a bit now.

01:28:15.517 --> 01:28:16.608
LAURA: Matt!

01:28:16.608 --> 01:28:17.494
MATT: What?

01:28:17.494 --> 01:28:19.304
LAURA: Can you heal me?

01:28:19.304 --> 01:28:21.969
MATT: You look all right.

01:28:21.969 --> 01:28:23.748
LAURA: I saw you heal Marisha.

01:28:23.748 --> 01:28:25.675
MATT: I'm pretty spent right now.

01:28:25.675 --> 01:28:27.966
LIAM: Sam, do me a favor and make a perception
check.

01:28:27.966 --> 01:28:31.317
SAM: Guys, I'm leading this party. Focus on me!

01:28:31.317 --> 01:28:33.147
MATT: We're all going to die.

01:28:33.147 --> 01:28:36.503
LAURA: Can I try to close up my wounds that I
got?

01:28:36.503 --> 01:28:37.754
SAM: 17.

01:28:37.754 --> 01:28:38.934
LIAM: 17?

01:28:38.934 --> 01:28:40.434
SAM: Yes.

01:28:40.434 --> 01:28:50.904
LIAM: It's not a one or a two? Through a gap
between three trees, way in the distance, you see

01:28:50.904 --> 01:28:59.006
a balding, white-haired little old man. And he
sees you seeing him, and he's gone again.

01:28:59.006 --> 01:29:06.488
SAM: Oh shit! I saw him! Guys, he's that way! We
should go that way, but maybe flank, right? I

01:29:06.488 --> 01:29:08.946
played paintball as a kid, so we can flank.

01:29:08.946 --> 01:29:10.258
LIAM: You are a kid.

01:29:10.258 --> 01:29:11.968
SAM: Come at him from two directions.

01:29:11.968 --> 01:29:13.265
LIAM: You're running?

01:29:13.265 --> 01:29:14.316
TRAVIS: I'm booking ass.

01:29:14.316 --> 01:29:16.245
LIAM: Wow! Travis is just running today!

01:29:16.245 --> 01:29:19.510
TRAVIS: I ran everywhere! I was fast as shit!

01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:21.098
LAURA: I'm running after Travis.

01:29:21.098 --> 01:29:24.500
TRAVIS: My ADHD was in overdrive all the time.

01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:27.776
SAM: But you have the mind of a current-day
Travis.

01:29:27.844 --> 01:29:29.562
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I'm fast again, y'all!

01:29:29.562 --> 01:29:31.248
LIAM: Is everybody following suit?

01:29:31.248 --> 01:29:32.399
LAURA: Yeah, I'm following Travis!

01:29:32.399 --> 01:29:34.307
SAM: No! I'm flanking! I'm flanking around.

01:29:34.307 --> 01:29:35.441
LIAM: You're flanking?

01:29:35.441 --> 01:29:37.831
MARISHA: I follow Riegel and I say, why are we
running?

01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:40.114
MATT: I follow Marisha because she's the biggest.

01:29:40.114 --> 01:29:42.021
TALIESIN: I follow Travis.

01:29:42.021 --> 01:29:43.652
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm running.

01:29:43.652 --> 01:29:47.532
LIAM: Okay. Are you with this group? The flanking
or the straight-on?

01:29:47.532 --> 01:29:48.848
ASHLEY: Straight-on.

01:29:48.848 --> 01:29:53.381
LIAM: You guys start booking through and trying to
stay up. You're slipping as you go, but managing

01:29:53.381 --> 01:29:59.107
to catch up. And he is old. You're getting closer
to the spot where you saw him, Sam. And you're

01:29:59.107 --> 01:30:03.887
looking over, you're playing the raptor; maybe you
can catch him from the side. You guys are still

01:30:03.887 --> 01:30:11.005
going down. All of you are going down and then
ahead. You notice that you guys are in separate

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:17.155
wedges of a hill that are both leading now to the
same place. And you see this guy again, and he

01:30:17.155 --> 01:30:23.819
scuttles over a little ridge and down. He scuttles
up over a little bit of ridge of plant and mud,

01:30:23.819 --> 01:30:29.105
and then he disappears from view. And it's almost
like you're looking at-- it's so thick here, the

01:30:29.105 --> 01:30:32.781
trees are so thick that you can probably get
through on the sides, but there's one big

01:30:32.781 --> 01:30:38.444
main entrance here that is scooped up in like an
upside-down U of plant growth.

01:30:38.639 --> 01:30:39.970
SAM: One way in.

01:30:39.970 --> 01:30:42.954
LAURA: Let's start running.

01:30:42.954 --> 01:30:44.220
MARISHA: Yeah, go.

01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:45.819
LAURA: Who's charging after him!

01:30:45.819 --> 01:30:47.382
SAM: We're all going in together, I guess.

01:30:47.382 --> 01:30:48.571
LIAM: Okay.

01:30:48.571 --> 01:30:50.441
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go run into the funnel.

01:30:50.441 --> 01:30:55.746
LIAM: Okay. all right. So you guys converge and
you're running after this old man, and you guys

01:30:55.746 --> 01:31:01.507
climb up to the top of the ridge and you see-- oh
gosh, I think there's a scene in Jurassic Park

01:31:01.507 --> 01:31:06.280
where it's a long sort of tunnel. Where that guy
gets eaten by the little critters? Anybody

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:13.261
remember this? Yeah. And so it winds straight
ahead like that, and as you're running, Taliesin,

01:31:13.261 --> 01:31:20.319
you're the only one who sees it because you're the
shortest. You see a metal sign bent over, peeking

01:31:20.319 --> 01:31:26.823
out from behind two trees, red dripping down it.
And you see a one, you see a four. And then you're

01:31:26.879 --> 01:31:36.497
past it, and everybody's running. And this old man
is maybe a hundred feet ahead of you.

01:31:36.557 --> 01:31:38.389
LAURA: Can we yell out to him?

01:31:38.389 --> 01:31:39.514
LIAM: Sure.

01:31:39.514 --> 01:31:44.050
LAURA: Hey! Stop running, what the fuck. We're
just trying to figure out what's happening!

01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:46.184
ASHLEY: We're just kids!

01:31:46.184 --> 01:31:49.798
LIAM: He does stop, and spins around. He's still
pretty far away from you, and he looks

01:31:49.839 --> 01:31:52.770
(breathes heavily).

01:31:52.770 --> 01:31:53.739
LAURA: Hey!

01:31:53.739 --> 01:32:01.040
LIAM: (breathes heavily) And he spins and he
continues to run.

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:02.457
LAURA: Oh, come on!

01:32:02.457 --> 01:32:03.543
MARISHA: Oh, I keep going.

01:32:03.543 --> 01:32:04.545
LAURA: We keep going.

01:32:04.545 --> 01:32:12.123
LIAM: Everybody starts to run. I'm so sorry. You
feel the air around you start to vibrate around

01:32:12.123 --> 01:32:21.669
you, and your head starts to rattle in your skull.
And you hear, at that moment, the sound of a war

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:28.619
horn? Massive. It feels like the inside of your
head, your skull, is vibrating like a bell. Your

01:32:28.619 --> 01:32:35.094
teeth are shaking. Your eyes feel like they are
expanding in their sockets, and you feel

01:32:35.094 --> 01:32:40.842
(explosion noise), and everything changes.

01:32:40.842 --> 01:32:42.713
TRAVIS: It's Inception.

01:32:42.713 --> 01:32:46.083
MARISHA: Oh god, are we going deeper? No.

01:32:46.083 --> 01:32:49.418
LIAM: Everything grows darker.

01:32:49.418 --> 01:32:50.814
MARISHA: No.

01:32:50.814 --> 01:33:02.381
LIAM: The gentler sounds of the jungle are
suddenly gone. You find yourselves, suddenly, as

01:33:02.381 --> 01:33:15.435
your sight stops blurring, looking at the ocean.
You're standing in miserably frigid cold water

01:33:15.435 --> 01:33:22.135
swirling around your legs and your waist. And
you're staring out at the horizon, and the sky--

01:33:22.135 --> 01:33:29.777
it's so jarring, it's so different than where you
were. You're staring out at dark clouds above you

01:33:30.019 --> 01:33:38.267
and over the horizon. And that horn that is
blasting finally quits, and you just hear the

01:33:38.267 --> 01:33:46.810
sound of the surf. Of waves crashing on a beach. A
beach behind you.

01:33:46.810 --> 01:33:52.164
ASHLEY: Are there any footprints on the beach
leading from the water?

01:33:52.164 --> 01:33:58.610
LIAM: You turn away from the water, Ashley. And
from your place in the surf, you see the remnants

01:33:58.610 --> 01:34:09.833
and rubble of a freeway, stretching from the water
you're in back toward the land and away. But all

01:34:09.833 --> 01:34:16.258
of your minds, as you turn with her, have only a
second to process your whereabouts, because before

01:34:16.258 --> 01:34:25.511
you stands a wall of horror. The living
manifestation of woe is gathered in front of you.

01:34:25.511 --> 01:34:37.195
A vast horde of writhing, malignant nightmares
stand watching you. All shapes and sizes.

01:34:37.195 --> 01:34:39.235
MARISHA: Casting directors.

01:34:39.235 --> 01:34:48.252
LIAM: Black, oiled, insect-like flesh. White
chalky corpse-like figures. Literal devils.

01:34:48.252 --> 01:34:50.428
SAM: Commercial casting directors.

01:34:50.428 --> 01:34:59.796
LIAM: Hundreds of eyes, seeming to hungrily covet
your flesh. And towering above them all, rising 40

01:34:59.796 --> 01:35:07.995
to 50 feet in the air, stands an apocalyptic
monstrosity out of the Book of Revelations. A

01:35:07.995 --> 01:35:19.781
massive, two-headed titan standing on two scaled,
powerful legs, staring down at you all. The head

01:35:19.781 --> 01:35:31.020
on this side, brow furrowed, face unmoving. The
eyes just judging you. The head on this side,

01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:40.306
craning forward, its terrible maw stretched wide.
A long tongue slathering back and forth across its

01:35:40.306 --> 01:35:48.647
enormous teeth. Hungering. The horn of the
apocalypse tears the air again, rattling your

01:35:48.647 --> 01:35:58.373
brains in your little skulls as the legion before
you begins to jibber and shriek. Everyone roll for

01:35:58.373 --> 01:36:01.135
initiative.

01:36:01.135 --> 01:36:02.781
MARISHA: What's happening?

01:36:02.781 --> 01:36:04.952
MATT: What?

01:36:04.952 --> 01:36:07.699
SAM: It's everything we've ever faced.

01:36:07.699 --> 01:36:12.216
LAURA: Oh my god. We're going to die!

01:36:12.216 --> 01:36:14.010
MARISHA: Brought to you by the producers of
Independence Day!

01:36:14.010 --> 01:36:15.213
LAURA: For real!

01:36:15.213 --> 01:36:16.391
ASHLEY: What?

01:36:16.391 --> 01:36:22.543
MATT: So, even-- (laughs) So. Do I know what this
is?

01:36:22.543 --> 01:36:24.392
MARISHA: From the producers of 2012!

01:36:24.392 --> 01:36:26.021
LIAM: You think so.

01:36:26.021 --> 01:36:31.238
MATT: Okay. Me as Matt Mercer, even at 12, Matt
Mercer-- (laughs)

01:36:31.238 --> 01:36:32.845
LAURA: Hey Matt!

01:36:32.845 --> 01:36:34.714
LIAM: Can I get a little more juice on the audio,
please?

01:36:34.714 --> 01:36:36.849
LAURA: Thanks for healing me!

01:36:36.849 --> 01:36:39.086
MARISHA: Whoa!

01:36:39.086 --> 01:36:40.960
LIAM: Let's roll for initiative, guys.

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.082
TALIESIN: Oh god.

01:36:42.082 --> 01:36:44.067
MATT: Oh, great. That's great.

01:36:44.067 --> 01:36:48.413
SAM: As, as we roll, I look down to see if-- Are
we any older, or are we the same age?

01:36:48.413 --> 01:36:49.481
LIAM: Same age.

01:36:49.481 --> 01:36:50.618
MARISHA: Same age?

01:36:50.618 --> 01:36:54.567
SAM: I check if I've got pubes. Do I have pubes?

01:36:54.567 --> 01:36:56.124
LIAM: 25 to 20?

01:36:56.124 --> 01:36:58.591
TRAVIS: Nope. Nair.

01:36:58.591 --> 01:37:01.865
LIAM: Nobody there? 15 to 20?

01:37:01.865 --> 01:37:02.941
LAURA: 17.

01:37:02.941 --> 01:37:04.183
MARISHA: 15.

01:37:04.183 --> 01:37:08.835
LIAM: 17, 15? Laura, Marisha. Okay, ten to 15?

01:37:08.835 --> 01:37:10.018
TALIESIN: 13.

01:37:10.018 --> 01:37:11.064
LIAM: 13.

01:37:11.064 --> 01:37:12.499
SAM: Ten!

01:37:12.499 --> 01:37:17.798
LIAM: Ten. Okay. I got Travis, Ashley, and Matt
left. What have you guys got?

01:37:17.798 --> 01:37:18.869
ASHLEY: Seven.

01:37:18.869 --> 01:37:19.898
TRAVIS: Nine.

01:37:19.898 --> 01:37:21.286
MATT: Four.

01:37:21.286 --> 01:37:22.293
LIAM: Okay.

01:37:22.293 --> 01:37:25.447
ASHLEY: Oh shit.

01:37:25.447 --> 01:37:26.954
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:37:26.954 --> 01:37:30.512
ASHLEY: What?

01:37:30.512 --> 01:37:32.463
MARISHA: What are these things?

01:37:32.463 --> 01:37:34.198
LAURA: What is that big thing?

01:37:34.198 --> 01:37:35.751
SAM: You know, I think we can take them, guys.

01:37:35.751 --> 01:37:37.185
ASHLEY: Can anybody make a boat?

01:37:37.185 --> 01:37:38.579
MARISHA: It's a really big thing.

01:37:38.579 --> 01:37:40.509
LIAM: Laura Bailey.

01:37:40.570 --> 01:37:41.647
LAURA: What?

01:37:41.647 --> 01:37:43.622
LIAM: What would you like to do?

01:37:43.622 --> 01:37:45.113
LAURA: Where are we?

01:37:45.113 --> 01:37:49.390
LIAM: Oh. That's important, isn't it? You're in
the water.

01:37:49.390 --> 01:37:53.221
MATT: So, you guys know in Stranger Things, that
the big monster they keep talking about?

01:37:53.221 --> 01:37:54.379
ASHLEY: The demogorgon?

01:37:54.379 --> 01:37:55.605
LAURA: The demogorgon?

01:37:55.605 --> 01:37:57.813
MARISHA: Is that what that is?

01:37:57.813 --> 01:37:59.506
SAM: I think we can take it.

01:37:59.506 --> 01:38:01.425
LAURA: I think--

01:38:01.425 --> 01:38:07.007
SAM: Wait. They won't come into the water. Maybe
we just stay here.

01:38:07.007 --> 01:38:09.479
TALIESIN: That's gremlins. Gremlins won't come
into the water.

01:38:09.479 --> 01:38:12.231
(laughter)

01:38:12.231 --> 01:38:13.757
MATT: Gremlins can go in the water.

01:38:13.757 --> 01:38:14.964
TALIESIN: That just makes more of them.

01:38:14.964 --> 01:38:16.723
MATT: Yeah. There's no good answer here.

01:38:16.723 --> 01:38:18.517
LAURA: Matt, how do you kill these things?

01:38:18.517 --> 01:38:26.240
MATT: I can't tell you. My initiative's four. Go!
I'm too scared. In fact, if we weren't halfway in

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:29.872
the ocean, you would see the soak marks on the
front of my jeans.

01:38:29.872 --> 01:38:32.210
TRAVIS: And in fact, around Matt, the water is
quite warm.

01:38:32.210 --> 01:38:33.342
MATT: Yeah.

01:38:33.342 --> 01:38:35.759
TALIESIN: Better than a chlorinated pool, man

01:38:35.759 --> 01:38:38.078
MARISHA: (laughs) A chlorinated pool?

01:38:38.078 --> 01:38:40.200
TALIESIN: It'd be a little green.

01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:43.144
LAURA: I have nothing. I'm just going to back up
further into the water.

01:38:43.144 --> 01:38:49.206
LIAM: Okay. It is rough going. You can go about 15
feet as you push your way back. Now you're moving

01:38:49.206 --> 01:38:54.059
backward in the water, and the water's now up to
your childlike collarbone.

01:38:54.059 --> 01:39:03.270
LAURA: Can I hold my breath and put it under the
water and see what I can see under the water?

01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:04.836
LIAM: That's what you want to do?

01:39:04.836 --> 01:39:05.814
LAURA: Yeah!

01:39:05.814 --> 01:39:10.003
LIAM: Okay, you do. You splash under
the water, and it is jarring. It is so ice-cold.

01:39:10.054 --> 01:39:16.243
And as you do, you see a very thick serpent swim
past your face.

01:39:16.243 --> 01:39:25.736
LAURA: What?! Bubbles! (laughs) I come back up out
of the water. We're surrounded! There's something

01:39:25.736 --> 01:39:27.210
in the water!

01:39:27.210 --> 01:39:29.143
MATT: (screams)

01:39:29.143 --> 01:39:32.084
LIAM: Marisha, what would you like to do?

01:39:32.084 --> 01:39:34.851
MARISHA and LAURA: (scream)

01:39:34.851 --> 01:39:36.666
TRAVIS: Go. Have no fear!

01:39:36.666 --> 01:39:45.351
MARISHA: Okay. Well, I fucking hate the cold above
all things! Which is a hundred percent true, so

01:39:45.351 --> 01:39:51.291
I'm going to fuck this ice-water shit, and start
heading out towards the beach, just because that

01:39:51.291 --> 01:39:53.145
would be my first concern.

01:39:53.145 --> 01:39:58.117
LIAM: Okay. You are now standing on the beach,
looking at a legion from hell.

01:39:58.117 --> 01:40:15.008
MARISHA: I say, Yeah! What's up?! This is the
party at the end of the world, right? And I just

01:40:15.008 --> 01:40:24.139
start dancing. Hey! And I cry a little. Oh! Hey!
Oh!

01:40:24.139 --> 01:40:29.231
LIAM: The giant continues to judge you. On your
sides, there are two very large-- not as big as

01:40:29.231 --> 01:40:36.062
the big guy, obviously, but two winged, twice the
size of you guys, bent over muscular ropey winged

01:40:36.062 --> 01:40:43.434
creatures, and they just stand there going (raspy
breaths) here and here. Taliesin, what would you

01:40:43.434 --> 01:40:44.436
like to do?

01:40:44.436 --> 01:40:48.737
TALIESIN: I'm going to join Marisha on the beach
because I hate the water.

01:40:48.737 --> 01:40:50.057
LIAM: Yes, I remembered.

01:40:50.057 --> 01:40:52.930
TALIESIN: And it's cold. And this has kind of
happened to me before.

01:40:52.930 --> 01:40:54.462
SAM: The whole monster thing?

01:40:54.462 --> 01:40:57.923
TALIESIN: This whole thing has kind of happened.
And, this is true, I'm going to say what I said

01:40:57.923 --> 01:40:58.968
last time.

01:40:58.968 --> 01:41:00.161
MARISHA: Do it.

01:41:00.161 --> 01:41:05.081
TALIESIN: This is true, and you might know this.
Mister Satan dude, we are totally

01:41:05.081 --> 01:41:07.377
ready to serve you!

01:41:07.377 --> 01:41:10.342
(laughter)

01:41:10.342 --> 01:41:12.746
LIAM: Make a persuasion check.

01:41:12.746 --> 01:41:20.252
TALIESIN: This is literally what I said last time
this happened. Oh boy, that's not great.

01:41:20.252 --> 01:41:22.029
TRAVIS: But there are fish in the ocean,
Taliesin!

01:41:22.029 --> 01:41:23.705
TALIESIN: That's why I got out. Eight.

01:41:23.705 --> 01:41:25.865
LIAM: Eight? Noted. Okay.

01:41:25.865 --> 01:41:29.620
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my full action until
something happens.

01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:34.176
LIAM: Okay, until what happens?

01:41:34.176 --> 01:41:38.677
TALIESIN: Until they start moving within ten feet
of me.

01:41:38.677 --> 01:41:40.803
LIAM: Okay, got it. Sam, what would you like to
do?

01:41:40.803 --> 01:41:42.662
SAM: I'm going to also join them on the beach.

01:41:42.662 --> 01:41:43.815
LIAM: Okay.

01:41:43.815 --> 01:41:55.604
SAM: And similarly, I'm going to hold up the skull
of Bixby and say: We serve the darkness as you do!

01:41:55.604 --> 01:42:03.370
We will do your bidding if you will let us! Please
spare our lives so that we may serve yours!

01:42:03.370 --> 01:42:06.192
LIAM: Make a persuasion check.

01:42:06.192 --> 01:42:10.654
SAM: 14.

01:42:10.654 --> 01:42:16.512
LIAM: Okay, noted. Ashley, what would you like to
do?

01:42:16.512 --> 01:42:29.445
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to go up on the beach, and
I'm going to join them in their persuasion, and

01:42:29.445 --> 01:42:36.296
I'm going to use the dead cat again. And I'm just
going to take a bite of it.

01:42:36.296 --> 01:42:38.883
(laughter)

01:42:38.883 --> 01:42:40.191
MARISHA: You're Ozzy Osbourne and shit?

01:42:40.191 --> 01:42:41.808
TALIESIN: We could have so hung out.

01:42:41.808 --> 01:42:45.102
LIAM: Make a persuasion check.

01:42:45.102 --> 01:42:51.218
ASHLEY: Does that count?

01:42:51.218 --> 01:42:52.579
MATT: It's what you rolled.

01:42:52.579 --> 01:42:57.686
ASHLEY: 19.

01:42:57.686 --> 01:42:59.682
LIAM: Okay, noted.

01:42:59.682 --> 01:43:01.393
SAM: That's good.

01:43:01.393 --> 01:43:15.617
LIAM: Yes, it is. Gigantic feet crunch down in the
sand as he slowly walks forward, or they do, and

01:43:15.617 --> 01:43:19.307
one head stares at you, little man.

01:43:19.307 --> 01:43:20.684
TRAVIS: Oh no.

01:43:20.684 --> 01:43:24.022
LIAM: Make a strength check.

01:43:24.022 --> 01:43:29.424
TRAVIS: A strength check. That's a nine.

01:43:29.424 --> 01:43:40.440
LIAM: Okay. Travis, you feel your whole body lock
up as you are lifted out of the water, straight up

01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:49.686
into the air, and a little bit forward. And your
little duder body is just floated forward and you

01:43:49.686 --> 01:43:56.790
are frozen in terror. You can't move a muscle, and
the head on this side is just staring at you.

01:43:56.790 --> 01:43:58.177
TRAVIS: Oh god.

01:43:58.177 --> 01:44:01.317
LAURA: Just a little poo falls into the water.

01:44:01.317 --> 01:44:07.162
TRAVIS: A little rabbit pellet makes it through
the shorts. Straight through.

01:44:07.162 --> 01:44:09.965
MATT: You've been hoarding Cocoa Puffs.

01:44:09.965 --> 01:44:11.930
LIAM: Matt, what would you like to do?

01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:24.270
MATT: Okay. So, being both a bard and being a kid
that both as an adult and in that age spent a lot

01:44:24.270 --> 01:44:32.150
of free time alone reading monster manuals and
cryptozoology books, can I possibly see if I

01:44:32.150 --> 01:44:39.468
recognize any sort of nature to this creature? Any
sort of religious context to it, or any idea where

01:44:39.468 --> 01:44:41.707
it may have come from?

01:44:41.707 --> 01:44:46.915
LIAM: It looks like the shit you saw in your DND
books, man.

01:44:46.915 --> 01:45:00.890
MATT: Okay! Seeing as how Ashley already seems to
be the one that's on the right track, I'm going to

01:45:00.890 --> 01:45:04.057
begin to step towards the water. Using a bonus
action, I'm going to go ahead and give her bardic

01:45:04.057 --> 01:45:08.516
inspiration and be like, Ashley, continue to prove
your savagery!

01:45:08.516 --> 01:45:12.532
(laughter)

01:45:12.532 --> 01:45:17.935
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

01:45:18.092 --> 01:45:26.129
MATT: Chew deep and revel in the insanity, as this
day, we prove our mettle against the force of

01:45:26.309 --> 01:45:27.684
darkness!

01:45:27.684 --> 01:45:29.654
ASHLEY: Chew deep?

01:45:29.654 --> 01:45:31.000
MATT: Yes!

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.345
MARISHA: What does that even mean, chew deep?

01:45:33.345 --> 01:45:36.824
TRAVIS: With fogged-up glasses.

01:45:36.824 --> 01:45:42.369
MATT: Yeah, my glasses right are now are like
every classic anime teacher, it's just too fogged

01:45:42.369 --> 01:45:47.980
where you can't see the eyes. It's just a straight
white glare. I step out of the water towards this

01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:55.230
entity and say: Oh great demogorgon, deity from
upon the Abyss who brings its hordes to the

01:45:55.230 --> 01:46:01.029
shoreline, we are but humble servants, prostrate
before you, granting you the power we have to

01:46:01.098 --> 01:46:06.409
offer as we ourselves traverse across many worlds.
We have much gifts to grant you, and follow you to

01:46:06.409 --> 01:46:08.502
the ends of this plane.

01:46:08.502 --> 01:46:12.421
LIAM: Make a religion check.

01:46:12.421 --> 01:46:17.194
MATT: Not so great. Seven.

01:46:17.194 --> 01:46:22.951
LIAM: One last little squirt comes out of your
ding dong.

01:46:22.951 --> 01:46:26.653
MATT: You got this, Ashley!

01:46:26.653 --> 01:46:36.523
LIAM: He would like to use one of his legendary
actions now. And you see his long, nightmarish

01:46:36.523 --> 01:46:46.602
tail swing, coil, and then whip out, and strikes
down and lands on Marisha and crushes her into the

01:46:46.602 --> 01:47:01.853
beach and rips away. And you see a smear on the
sand. You see a clump of red hair. And some

01:47:01.853 --> 01:47:03.176
innards.

01:47:03.176 --> 01:47:10.752
TRAVIS: You're a track mark!

01:47:10.752 --> 01:47:15.237
LIAM: Laura, what would you like to do?

01:47:15.237 --> 01:47:17.237
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

01:47:17.237 --> 01:47:21.316
LAURA: I think I'm going to just stand back in the
water and continue to scream.

01:47:21.316 --> 01:47:23.577
LIAM: Okay. Noted.

01:47:23.577 --> 01:47:29.503
LAURA: (screams) Get back in the water! Get back!
It just killed Marisha! Get back in the water! And

01:47:29.503 --> 01:47:32.420
then I'm going to try and jump up and see if I can
reach Travis's leg.

01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:34.610
LIAM: His leg? He's 30 feet in the air.

01:47:34.610 --> 01:47:35.847
LAURA: I can't reach you!

01:47:35.847 --> 01:47:38.512
TRAVIS: Watch out, there's poop down there!

01:47:38.512 --> 01:47:41.298
LAURA: I see it!

01:47:41.298 --> 01:47:44.801
LIAM: Is that the end?

01:47:44.801 --> 01:47:48.398
LAURA: I'm just staying. I'm going to stay and
just hold my sticks.

01:47:48.398 --> 01:47:59.886
LIAM: Off on your left, you see. (splashing
noises) It doesn't come all the way. It just

01:47:59.886 --> 01:48:01.911
watches you.

01:48:01.911 --> 01:48:08.814
MARISHA: Guys, they hate people who are
marketable! That's the key! Be marketable!

01:48:08.814 --> 01:48:13.136
MATT: Which is the echo we hear in our minds. We
don't hear out loud, as she's nothing

01:48:13.136 --> 01:48:14.549
but a hairy smear.

01:48:14.549 --> 01:48:16.763
LIAM: Mr. Mom, what would you like to do?

01:48:16.763 --> 01:48:18.714
SAM: Woobie, woobie, woobie!

01:48:18.714 --> 01:48:42.717
TALIESIN: I am not pleased. I am going to start
wishing that we had some help with this somehow,

01:48:42.717 --> 01:48:48.505
and I'm going to start, I suppose, casting Unseen
Servant?

01:48:48.505 --> 01:48:50.023
LIAM: Okay.

01:48:50.023 --> 01:48:55.746
TALIESIN: And I'm going to attempt to create
something to catch Travis when he lands.

01:48:55.746 --> 01:48:56.825
LIAM: Okay.

01:48:56.825 --> 01:49:02.947
TALIESIN: And otherwise, I think I'm just staring
at the ground for the moment, because that was a

01:49:02.947 --> 01:49:04.806
lot that just happened.

01:49:04.806 --> 01:49:11.225
LIAM: Yeah. Guys, everybody sees a spectral form
of a grown Taliesin Jaffe appear next to child

01:49:11.225 --> 01:49:18.536
Taliesin Jaffe, and floats over floating Verno,
and spectral Taliesin just starts

01:49:18.536 --> 01:49:21.315
going like this.

01:49:21.315 --> 01:49:25.015
TALIESIN: Thank you for making that as awkward as
humanly possible.

01:49:25.015 --> 01:49:28.499
LIAM: Yes, you're welcome. All done?

01:49:28.499 --> 01:49:29.653
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:49:29.653 --> 01:49:31.553
LIAM: Sam, what would you like to do?

01:49:31.553 --> 01:49:41.018
SAM: I mean, those are tendrils? What are those
things, those are just arms?

01:49:41.018 --> 01:49:42.131
LIAM: Tendrils.

01:49:42.131 --> 01:49:43.788
MATT: Giant arm. Tentacle arm.

01:49:43.788 --> 01:49:46.793
TRAVIS: Kill me. Kill me!

01:49:46.793 --> 01:49:48.826
SAM: With what, a rock?

01:49:48.826 --> 01:49:50.579
TRAVIS: I'm fucking dying up here, man!

01:49:50.579 --> 01:49:53.685
TALIESIN: If you try and kill him with a rock,
you'll kill him, so just go for it.

01:49:53.685 --> 01:50:00.147
SAM: I'm going to use my movement and my action to
dash--

01:50:00.147 --> 01:50:01.347
LIAM: Which way?

01:50:01.347 --> 01:50:02.872
SAM: At the demogorgon?

01:50:02.872 --> 01:50:03.706
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:50:03.706 --> 01:50:10.858
SAM: And I'm going to try to kill it with love and
give it a big hug around its leg and say, I

01:50:10.858 --> 01:50:12.106
forgive you!

01:50:12.106 --> 01:50:13.299
LIAM: You grab it by the leg?

01:50:13.299 --> 01:50:14.212
SAM: Yeah.

01:50:14.212 --> 01:50:18.178
LIAM: Okay, noted. Ashley, what would you like to
do?

01:50:18.178 --> 01:50:33.068
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to continue with what I'm
doing. I'm going to walk to Marisha's smear.

01:50:33.068 --> 01:50:35.150
Schmear?

01:50:35.208 --> 01:50:37.208
LIAM: Yeah, I mean, half her body's gone.

01:50:37.208 --> 01:50:46.449
ASHLEY: That's fine. Don't know what I'm doing, I
was weird as a 15-year-old, so I'm going to walk

01:50:46.449 --> 01:50:59.055
over to her body, what's left, and get my hands in
it. And I'm going to stare him in the eye, and I'm

01:50:59.055 --> 01:51:01.503
going to smear it.

01:51:01.503 --> 01:51:05.940
LIAM: You guys watch in horror as your friend
Ashley, pushed to the brink, crouches down and

01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:13.413
shoves her hands up into the hollowed-out ribcage
of Marisha Ray, pulls her hands down, and slathers

01:51:13.413 --> 01:51:16.957
it down her face, and suddenly we're in the Lord
of the Flies.

01:51:16.957 --> 01:51:22.783
ASHLEY: Is her ribcage free and loose?

01:51:22.783 --> 01:51:26.064
LIAM: Loose? I mean, yeah, she's a third of her
former weight.

01:51:26.064 --> 01:51:28.659
ASHLEY: I'm going to put it over my head.

01:51:28.659 --> 01:51:31.056
LIAM: That's your whole action. Okay.

01:51:31.056 --> 01:51:32.072
ASHLEY: That's fine.

01:51:32.072 --> 01:51:33.215
MARISHA: Wait, you're holding me?

01:51:33.215 --> 01:51:34.854
MATT: You're wearing her like a scarecrow?

01:51:34.854 --> 01:51:41.851
LIAM: Ashley picks up Marisha's broken open chest
cavity and head and matches the form of demogorgon

01:51:41.851 --> 01:51:44.749
somewhat and puts a second head on herself.

01:51:44.749 --> 01:51:45.788
MARISHA: What?

01:51:45.788 --> 01:51:46.931
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:51:46.931 --> 01:51:50.389
MARISHA: This is like what I want to have happen
when I die.

01:51:50.389 --> 01:51:52.498
LIAM: You're out of juice.

01:51:52.498 --> 01:51:54.001
TALIESIN: Died like she lived.

01:51:54.106 --> 01:51:55.080
ASHLEY: I don't know what to do.

01:51:55.163 --> 01:51:57.364
MARISHA: Wear like me a spirit hood! Do it,
Ashley, do it!

01:51:57.364 --> 01:52:01.324
MATT: She's puppeteering you like a Skeksis!
You're a Henson puppet!

01:52:01.324 --> 01:52:10.351
LIAM: Demogorgon's turn. Do you want to do
anything, Travis?

01:52:10.351 --> 01:52:13.610
TRAVIS: Oh sure, I just want to fucking run like a
rabbit, man.

01:52:13.610 --> 01:52:16.724
LIAM: Well, you're floating in the air. You want
to try to break free of his grip?

01:52:16.724 --> 01:52:19.146
TRAVIS: I'm going to go with it.

01:52:19.146 --> 01:52:20.817
LIAM: All right. You're going to go with it?

01:52:20.817 --> 01:52:21.915
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:52:21.915 --> 01:52:29.795
LIAM: He takes one step forward with Sam on the
leg, going for the ride, and Travis floats

01:52:29.795 --> 01:52:37.444
forward, right up between the two thing's heads
and the angry one on this side goes (growling) and

01:52:37.444 --> 01:52:43.539
takes the upper half of your body into its mouth
and the other one more daintily goes (chomping)

01:52:43.539 --> 01:52:51.411
and pulls a leg free, and child Travis is ripped
in half in front of you, blood raining down on Sam

01:52:51.411 --> 01:52:53.748
down below.

01:52:53.748 --> 01:52:59.608
TRAVIS: You hear a really girly scream from inside
the one mouth.

01:52:59.608 --> 01:53:04.783
SAM: But love conquers all!

01:53:04.783 --> 01:53:06.222
LAURA: Oh my god!

01:53:06.222 --> 01:53:08.403
LIAM: Matt, what would you like to do?

01:53:08.403 --> 01:53:10.823
MATT: Well, I've spent the entirety of the last
six seconds just staring at the place on the

01:53:10.823 --> 01:53:15.315
ground where Marisha was crushed. So I haven't
really been paying attention. Loosely paying

01:53:15.486 --> 01:53:20.808
attention to Ashley rummaging through her remains
and then wearing them like a wintertime jacket.

01:53:20.808 --> 01:53:22.139
ASHLEY: Sorry!

01:53:22.139 --> 01:53:27.707
MATT: But my fists are clenched, they're shaking,
the tears are streaming down my face, and whatever

01:53:27.766 --> 01:53:33.631
plan we had is out the window, and I just rush
towards the demogorgon, screaming. (screams) And

01:53:33.631 --> 01:53:35.184
I'm going to Thunderwave him.

01:53:35.184 --> 01:53:37.201
LIAM: Yes! Do it!

01:53:37.201 --> 01:53:40.578
MATT: So he needs to make a constitution saving
throw.

01:53:40.578 --> 01:53:42.975
LIAM: Are we doing anything about Sam?

01:53:42.975 --> 01:53:46.464
MATT: I don't fucking care about Sam right now, I
just want to hurt this thing.

01:53:46.464 --> 01:53:47.469
LIAM: Got it.

01:53:47.469 --> 01:53:48.830
SAM: I'm a child, Matt!

01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:52.636
LIAM: Got it. And it's, what is it, it's
constitution? Help me.

01:53:52.636 --> 01:53:56.712
MATT: Constitution. I'm just like, tears down my
face, just (screaming).

01:53:56.712 --> 01:53:59.226
LIAM: Okay. Sam, make a constitution save.

01:53:59.226 --> 01:54:04.944
SAM: 16 plus-- there's no number written there.

01:54:04.944 --> 01:54:06.707
MATT: You made it, he succeeds.

01:54:06.707 --> 01:54:08.654
LIAM: Yeah. Okay, so roll for damage.

01:54:08.654 --> 01:54:16.644
MATT: That is 13.

01:54:16.644 --> 01:54:18.226
LIAM: 13? Okay.

01:54:18.226 --> 01:54:19.433
MATT: 13 thunder damage.

01:54:19.433 --> 01:54:31.421
LIAM: You take six points of damage. Matt runs up
in anguish and just rage-terror screams and for no

01:54:31.421 --> 01:54:37.629
reason at all, a blast of energy just goes
(explosion noise) right out of him, rips the

01:54:37.629 --> 01:54:43.949
clothes off of Sam Riegel's child back, leaving
scars all over him. And the demogorgon just shifts

01:54:43.949 --> 01:54:55.667
his foot a little bit. And he'd like to use a
legendary action to stare at Crazy Pants Johnson.

01:54:55.667 --> 01:55:03.032
And you look at these two heads, now looking at
you, and their eyes seem to swirl in a miasma of

01:55:03.032 --> 01:55:08.663
hatred, and you feel your mind just go. Roll a
d10, please.

01:55:08.663 --> 01:55:11.489
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:55:11.489 --> 01:55:16.684
MATT: As my bonus action on my turn?

01:55:16.684 --> 01:55:17.709
LIAM: Yes.

01:55:17.709 --> 01:55:24.364
MATT: I now realise that I accidentally hit Sam,
and I'm like, Sam. We have to end this now. Let's

01:55:24.364 --> 01:55:27.425
do this. And you get an inspiration die, d6.

01:55:27.425 --> 01:55:30.010
LIAM: Okay. What did you roll on the d10?

01:55:30.010 --> 01:55:31.896
ASHLEY: I rolled a nine.

01:55:31.896 --> 01:55:40.889
LIAM: A nine? Oh. You felt your gorge rise up.
You're covered in the guts of your friend,

01:55:40.889 --> 01:55:48.230
Marisha. This is really weird, that thing is a
giant! But you've got to fight it, right? Yeah,

01:55:48.230 --> 01:55:51.513
I'm okay! I'm okay! And you steel yourself.

01:55:51.513 --> 01:55:54.568
SAM: Nice. She's hardcore.

01:55:54.568 --> 01:55:56.800
LIAM: Laura, what would you like to do?

01:55:56.800 --> 01:55:59.403
LAURA: As soon as I see it tear apart Travis?

01:55:59.403 --> 01:56:00.498
LIAM: Yeah.

01:56:00.498 --> 01:56:02.833
LAURA: I'm going to just turn the other way and
just start swimming out.

01:56:02.833 --> 01:56:03.742
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:56:03.742 --> 01:56:05.406
(laughter)

01:56:05.406 --> 01:56:06.832
LIAM: Okay, I'll just put you there on the map.

01:56:06.832 --> 01:56:09.525
LAURA: Nope! Nope, nope, nope!

01:56:09.525 --> 01:56:12.649
MATT: She takes the nope action.

01:56:12.649 --> 01:56:14.504
(laughter)

01:56:14.504 --> 01:56:16.294
TRAVIS: Triple dash!

01:56:16.294 --> 01:56:21.780
LIAM: You start to swim. You feel a serpent slide
past your rib cage as you go, and you freak out as

01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:22.903
you swim--

01:56:22.903 --> 01:56:24.269
LAURA: I'm going to take my stick and hit it!

01:56:24.269 --> 01:56:29.439
LIAM: You can't do that, because two clawed feet
latch into your back and lift you up, out of the

01:56:29.439 --> 01:56:40.082
water. You are now dangling about 20 feet-- yeah,
20 feet above the water. Here. Just dog paddling

01:56:40.082 --> 01:56:46.017
to nothing. And that's its turn. And Taliesin,
what would you like to do?

01:56:46.017 --> 01:56:49.863
TALIESIN: I get the sneaking suspicion that we're
screwed.

01:56:49.863 --> 01:56:51.606
TRAVIS: No, we're doing good.

01:56:51.606 --> 01:56:53.925
MATT: Yeah, on the ropes, man. On the ropes.

01:56:53.925 --> 01:56:55.389
SAM: He's looking pretty rough.

01:56:55.389 --> 01:56:56.802
TRAVIS: This is where we turn the tide.

01:56:56.802 --> 01:56:58.739
LAURA: He's definitely bloodied.

01:56:58.739 --> 01:57:02.212
TALIESIN: I'm feeling a little like this might be
the end. I'm not feeling pretty

01:57:02.212 --> 01:57:04.139
good about this, so--

01:57:04.139 --> 01:57:06.812
MARISHA: Walk into the ocean.

01:57:06.812 --> 01:57:12.513
TALIESIN: I'm just going to flick it off, and the
one, the little creature on the right--

01:57:12.513 --> 01:57:14.429
LIAM: This guy?

01:57:14.429 --> 01:57:17.208
TALIESIN: Yeah. Chill Touch. Just going to crush
that fucker as just a fuck-you.

01:57:17.373 --> 01:57:20.653
LIAM: Okay. Make a ranged attack.

01:57:20.653 --> 01:57:25.122
TALIESIN: Yeah. 15.

01:57:25.122 --> 01:57:26.425
LIAM: Sure.

01:57:26.425 --> 01:57:32.095
TALIESIN: I probably have to roll for damage on
that one because he's not tiny. Where's my d8s?

01:57:32.095 --> 01:57:39.870
Two. That's two points of necrotic damage.

01:57:39.870 --> 01:57:41.559
LIAM: Two points? Okay.

01:57:41.559 --> 01:57:43.200
TALIESIN: It's just a 1d8, right?

01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:45.449
LIAM: Yes, that's correct. It's 1d8.

01:57:45.449 --> 01:57:46.475
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:57:46.475 --> 01:57:50.182
LIAM: All right. So you plant your hand down into
the sand, and you feel that same energy surge out

01:57:50.182 --> 01:57:55.257
of your palm, and it bursts up under this
corpulent little pasty-faced dude, and it reaches

01:57:55.257 --> 01:58:01.199
up and grabs him by the gut, and pulls away a love
handle in tentacle form, down into the ground. And

01:58:01.199 --> 01:58:07.647
everybody around him just starts going (snarling),
and he's just got innards spilling out, going

01:58:07.647 --> 01:58:09.816
(gravelly dying sounds).

01:58:09.816 --> 01:58:11.845
LAURA: Gross.

01:58:11.845 --> 01:58:18.593
TALIESIN: I'm going to move my Unseen Servant
underneath Laura, just in case, to try and pull

01:58:18.593 --> 01:58:20.544
her to shore if she goes back down.

01:58:20.544 --> 01:58:25.460
LIAM: All right, so your Unseen Servant moves just
below Laura, and he uses his legendary action, and

01:58:25.460 --> 01:58:30.975
the tail whips out and goes (whipping sound), and
you watch as two-thirds of Taliesin's child guts are

01:58:30.975 --> 01:58:37.054
ripped out and he just falls, face forward, down
into the sand, and he is dead, and the Unseen

01:58:37.242 --> 01:58:38.800
Servant vanishes.

01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:40.159
LAURA: Oh no!

01:58:40.159 --> 01:58:44.018
LIAM: Sam, what would you like to do?

01:58:44.018 --> 01:58:45.094
SAM: Me?

01:58:45.094 --> 01:58:46.189
LIAM: Yeah.

01:58:46.189 --> 01:58:47.457
SAM: I'm partially naked.

01:58:47.457 --> 01:58:48.623
LIAM: Yeah.

01:58:48.623 --> 01:58:54.704
SAM: I'm hugging a demogorgon. I would like to
climb up a little up his leg.

01:58:54.704 --> 01:58:55.881
LIAM: Okay.

01:58:55.881 --> 01:59:10.191
SAM: And just say: Kill them, but save me. I will
fan you and get you food, and whatever. Just kill

01:59:10.191 --> 01:59:13.152
them all. They're nothing, just save me. Just save
me.

01:59:13.152 --> 01:59:14.670
LIAM: Okay.

01:59:14.670 --> 01:59:15.671
SAM: That's it.

01:59:15.671 --> 01:59:17.014
LIAM: Okay. Ashley.

01:59:17.014 --> 01:59:18.414
SAM: Do I have to roll on anything?

01:59:18.414 --> 01:59:19.343
LIAM: Huh?

01:59:19.343 --> 01:59:20.485
SAM: Do I need to roll?

01:59:20.485 --> 01:59:22.280
LIAM: I mean, you already tried to persuade this
dude.

01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:25.315
SAM: All right. Then I got nothing.

01:59:25.315 --> 01:59:27.644
LIAM: Sure. Make a persuasion, at disadvantage.

01:59:27.644 --> 01:59:29.015
SAM: At disadvantage?

01:59:29.015 --> 01:59:29.917
LIAM: Yes.

01:59:29.917 --> 01:59:31.537
MATT: You can add your inspiration dice, if you
want.

01:59:31.537 --> 01:59:32.891
SAM: Well, it's a natural one.

01:59:32.891 --> 01:59:37.775
MATT: Oh. You probably shouldn't. You should hold
off on that. Save it for the next-- oh wait.

01:59:37.775 --> 01:59:41.849
LIAM: Ashley, what would you like to do?

01:59:41.849 --> 01:59:47.753
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:52.830
(laughter)

01:59:52.830 --> 01:59:55.733
ASHLEY: Your head up here. Listen.

01:59:55.733 --> 01:59:57.994
TRAVIS: She starts with "listen." (laughs)

01:59:57.994 --> 02:00:06.320
ASHLEY: We already know what's going to happen
here. We know we're going to die. But, guess what?

02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:14.662
After this, we go to another world, so you know
what? I don't like leading, and I don't like

02:00:14.662 --> 02:00:20.385
following, you motherfucker! Is my slingshot
ready?

02:00:20.439 --> 02:00:23.433
LIAM: No, you didn't have a chance to get to
that.

02:00:23.433 --> 02:00:29.684
ASHLEY: I'm going to take out a rock out of my
pocket, and I'm going to throw it at him.

02:00:29.684 --> 02:00:31.487
LIAM: Go for it. Make a ranged attack.

02:00:31.487 --> 02:00:33.913
ASHLEY: Okay. What am I doing?

02:00:33.913 --> 02:00:35.432
LIAM: Roll a d20.

02:00:35.432 --> 02:00:41.516
ASHLEY: I don't add anything, do I?

02:00:41.516 --> 02:00:51.878
LIAM: You might! It would be, for a ranged attack,
if it's not a weapon. It's an improvised weapon.

02:00:51.878 --> 02:00:53.477
Nothing.

02:00:53.477 --> 02:00:56.504
MATT: Well, dex or strength would be plus two.
You're not proficient with it

02:00:56.504 --> 02:00:58.441
LIAM: Let's do the dex.

02:00:58.441 --> 02:01:00.010
MATT: So, plus two to whatever you rolled.

02:01:00.010 --> 02:01:01.408
ASHLEY: (laughs) A six.

02:01:01.408 --> 02:01:05.262
LIAM: The rock bounces off of his belly
button-type area.

02:01:05.262 --> 02:01:08.520
ASHLEY: I don't care. I did it. I didn't mean for
it to actually hurt you.

02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:09.278
LIAM: Right.

02:01:09.278 --> 02:01:12.198
MATT: She has that much control!

02:01:12.198 --> 02:01:17.862
LIAM: Okay, well, the next thing that happens is
the double-armed tentacle comes down and wraps

02:01:17.862 --> 02:01:27.163
around your neck. And you watch as (splitting
noise) and you see two heads spin out to the

02:01:27.163 --> 02:01:28.080
ocean.

02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:29.184
TALIESIN: You killed it!

02:01:29.184 --> 02:01:30.393
LIAM: 40 feet.

02:01:30.393 --> 02:01:33.499
LAURA: Oh no!

02:01:33.499 --> 02:01:34.952
SAM: Who's left?

02:01:34.952 --> 02:01:36.554
LAURA: Me and Matt and Sam.

02:01:36.554 --> 02:01:38.421
SAM: My plan is working; I'm still alive!

02:01:38.421 --> 02:01:42.175
LAURA: I think he doesn't realize you're there.

02:01:42.175 --> 02:01:43.737
LIAM: What would you like to do, Matt?

02:01:43.737 --> 02:01:54.704
MATT: All right, staring this thing down, my
eyes-- I can't see anything because the water, so

02:01:54.704 --> 02:01:59.317
I rip the glasses off the front of my face and
throw them behind me on the beach and staring up

02:01:59.317 --> 02:02:05.206
at it I say: I know everything about you. I've
seen your pictures, I've read every single aspect

02:02:05.278 --> 02:02:10.467
of your existence. And here's the fun part: when
it all comes down to it, you're just a figment of

02:02:10.467 --> 02:02:15.052
some fat guy's imagination! Vicious Mockery.

02:02:15.052 --> 02:02:16.284
LIAM: Yeah!

02:02:16.284 --> 02:02:17.408
ASHLEY: Yes!

02:02:17.408 --> 02:02:18.693
LIAM: Legit!

02:02:18.693 --> 02:02:24.290
MATT: Nice, that's-- well, it makes a wisdom
saving throw.

02:02:24.290 --> 02:02:26.990
SAM: How do you want to do this?

02:02:26.990 --> 02:02:29.549
LIAM: What did you roll?

02:02:29.610 --> 02:02:31.927
MATT: Well, my DC is 13.

02:02:31.927 --> 02:02:41.534
LIAM: 13, okay. You see the angrier one on this
side going (growls, huffs, growls louder)

02:02:41.714 --> 02:02:44.042
MATT: Yeah!

02:02:44.042 --> 02:02:52.709
LIAM: And the other head swivels around so
they're both looking at you, and they stare into

02:02:52.709 --> 02:03:01.392
your insecure little 12-year-old soul. Roll a d10,
Matthew.

02:03:01.392 --> 02:03:05.372
MATT: Yeah. That's a sensitive place. Ten?

02:03:05.372 --> 02:03:13.925
LIAM: Ten? You have played too much fucking DND.
Nothing happens! You hold your own against the

02:03:13.925 --> 02:03:15.418
demogorgon.

02:03:15.418 --> 02:03:17.714
TRAVIS: (laughs) You've played too much DND.

02:03:17.714 --> 02:03:20.053
LIAM: Laura, what would you like to do?

02:03:20.053 --> 02:03:24.918
LAURA: I'm going to take my sticks out and I'm
going to try to stab the tentacle that's holding

02:03:24.918 --> 02:03:26.517
me up in the air.

02:03:26.517 --> 02:03:28.054
LIAM: Roll to make an attack.

02:03:28.054 --> 02:03:31.094
LAURA: Do I add anything? My dex?

02:03:31.094 --> 02:03:32.080
LIAM: Yes, your dex.

02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:33.328
LAURA: 11.

02:03:33.328 --> 02:03:35.765
LIAM: Okay.

02:03:35.765 --> 02:03:38.002
LAURA: I'm trying to break out my grapple.

02:03:38.002 --> 02:03:41.478
LIAM: Right. Well, that would be a strength check.
Do you want to break out of the grapple?

02:03:41.478 --> 02:03:48.780
LAURA: Oh. Well, I'm just going to try to-- no,
I'm going to attack the tentacle.

02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:53.629
LIAM: Okay. Well, that doesn't do shit because
he's got you so firmly grasping in his taloned

02:03:53.629 --> 02:03:56.062
feet that you can't turn around and get at him.

02:03:56.062 --> 02:03:57.875
LAURA: Oh, then I try to break out of the
grapple!

02:03:57.875 --> 02:04:04.240
LIAM: No, what happened was you tried to get him
with a stick and you couldn't turn around. You got

02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:05.775
a bonus action?

02:04:05.775 --> 02:04:08.975
LAURA: I don't know what I can do as a bonus
action.

02:04:08.975 --> 02:04:11.193
SAM: She's a rogue.

02:04:11.193 --> 02:04:13.831
LIAM: Rogue.

02:04:13.831 --> 02:04:20.079
LAURA: I can't disengage; I'm not a high enough
level. I'm just a me.

02:04:20.079 --> 02:04:21.433
LIAM: Level of Laura?

02:04:21.433 --> 02:04:24.104
LAURA: Yeah, level of Laura at 13, 12, or
whatever.

02:04:24.104 --> 02:04:32.330
LIAM: Okay. You hear a little sizzling sound and
you feel the thing's body flex against you, and

02:04:32.387 --> 02:04:38.592
then you don't even know what happened; there is a
noxious fume all around you going into your eyes

02:04:38.592 --> 02:04:45.270
and your nose. Everything burns; your throat and
your nose burn, the insides of your ears burn. I

02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:48.662
would like you to make a con save.

02:04:48.662 --> 02:04:54.707
LAURA: Okay. 11!

02:04:54.707 --> 02:05:01.858
LIAM: Okay. Your body locks up. You can't move and
he lets go. You fall into the water, frozen.

02:05:01.858 --> 02:05:03.769
SAM: That's nice!

02:05:03.769 --> 02:05:05.862
TALIESIN: In theory, you'd be caught by my Unseen
Servant.

02:05:05.862 --> 02:05:07.480
LIAM: No, that vanished when you died.

02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:08.846
TALIESIN: Oh, that vanished when I died!

02:05:08.846 --> 02:05:10.366
LAURA: Oh no!

02:05:10.366 --> 02:05:14.865
MATT: You fall just in time to see this floating
Taliesin go (wind whooshing).

02:05:15.052 --> 02:05:16.425
That would suck so bad.

02:05:16.425 --> 02:05:18.374
LIAM: Sam, what would you like to do?

02:05:18.374 --> 02:05:20.389
MARISHA: I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm not okay!

02:05:20.389 --> 02:05:23.913
SAM: I climb up higher.

02:05:23.913 --> 02:05:25.799
LIAM: Now make an athletics check.

02:05:25.799 --> 02:05:29.474
SAM: Sure. Natural 20!

02:05:29.474 --> 02:05:31.448
LIAM: Oh my god, how high do you want to go?

02:05:31.448 --> 02:05:33.248
SAM: All the way up to its ear.

02:05:33.248 --> 02:05:41.239
LIAM: Done. You scrabble up like a little spider
monkey all the way up, panicked, climbing up on

02:05:41.239 --> 02:05:44.035
top. "Hi!" And you're there.

02:05:44.035 --> 02:05:53.985
SAM: I can sing you show tunes! I know doo-wop
songs! I will do your bidding forever if you just

02:05:53.985 --> 02:05:56.110
let me live!

02:05:56.110 --> 02:06:00.410
LIAM: And your voices stops as the sharp end of
his tail splits through the back of your skull and

02:06:00.410 --> 02:06:02.909
breaks your face open entirely.

02:06:02.909 --> 02:06:04.422
SAM: I can work with this!

02:06:04.422 --> 02:06:08.959
LIAM: Beautiful, beautiful smile. That beautiful
smile gone.

02:06:08.959 --> 02:06:12.663
TRAVIS: And then there was two.

02:06:12.663 --> 02:06:16.406
MARISHA: Rodgers and Hammerstein.

02:06:16.406 --> 02:06:17.546
SAM: True.

02:06:17.546 --> 02:06:18.674
MATT: That'll kill you.

02:06:18.674 --> 02:06:27.357
LIAM: The demogorgon bends over and looks down at
you, Matthew, and somehow, you knew this was the

02:06:27.357 --> 02:06:41.585
way it would always be. And a giant, ropey foot
rises up and you don't see shit. Laura, what would

02:06:41.585 --> 02:06:43.753
you like to do? Oh, she's not here.

02:06:43.753 --> 02:06:45.299
SAM: Oh my god, she disappeared.

02:06:45.299 --> 02:07:01.317
LIAM: She's also drowning. We don't need her,
then. Okay. Hey, I want that, yeah. So, her body

02:07:01.317 --> 02:07:12.349
frozen in the ocean, water seeping in. She feels
her throat constrict and choke, and everything

02:07:12.349 --> 02:07:32.206
goes quiet. Not that quiet. There we go. The
vision blurs and turns a pure, merciful white.

02:07:32.262 --> 02:07:33.901
And that's where we'll take our break.

02:07:34.095 --> 02:07:35.044
MARISHA: Oh, what?

02:07:35.044 --> 02:07:36.196
MATT: All righty!

02:07:36.196 --> 02:07:37.732
SAM: We're dead! End of session.

02:07:37.732 --> 02:07:39.650
LIAM: We'll just talk about it for an hour after
we come back.

02:07:39.650 --> 02:07:40.749
MATT: Probably.

02:07:40.749 --> 02:07:42.237
MARISHA: I've had this dream.

02:07:42.237 --> 02:07:45.590
LIAM: I did have this dream. This is based on a
nightmare I had.

02:07:45.590 --> 02:07:47.145
MATT: Oh, what?

02:07:47.145 --> 02:07:48.784
ASHLEY: That's a terrible one.

02:07:48.784 --> 02:07:50.329
LIAM: It was real bad.

02:07:50.329 --> 02:07:55.736
TRAVIS: Did Ashley wear the upper torso of
Marisha in your dream?

02:07:55.736 --> 02:08:02.640
LIAM: No, none of you were there. It was just me
on a godforsaken beach. In my dream, these things,

02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:10.106
it wasn't demogorgon, it was Revelations, and they
were all on shitty wooden scaffolding, stretching

02:08:10.106 --> 02:08:17.451
in every direction for miles. And I just felt that
big and I was like, "Well, this is it." And that

02:08:17.451 --> 02:08:19.599
was the nightmare.

02:08:19.599 --> 02:08:22.279
SAM: I dreamt that I was late to a plane.

02:08:22.279 --> 02:08:24.876
(laughter)

02:08:24.876 --> 02:08:31.515
LIAM: That your eyesight was one tick off of
20/20. Dreadful. Well, guys that was a lot of fun.

02:08:31.515 --> 02:08:36.588
We laughed. We cried. We died. We'll see you in a
few.

02:08:36.588 --> 02:08:41.035
MARISHA: Oh, watch the Tabletop promo, it's real
good. We're real proud of it.

02:08:41.035 --> 02:08:51.959
LIAM: Is this mid-break, this guy? Yeah, sorry,
before I forget! Giveaway! I have got a Wyrmwood

02:08:51.959 --> 02:08:54.967
dice vault made of pink ivory wood.

02:08:54.967 --> 02:08:56.343
MARISHA: Yeah, you do!

02:08:56.343 --> 02:08:59.626
LIAM: You wanna get that code word: demogorgon!

02:08:59.626 --> 02:09:01.087
MARISHA and LIAM: Demogorgon!

02:09:01.087 --> 02:09:06.093
MARISHA: Spell it correctly if you want to win!
Demi-gorgon.

02:09:06.093 --> 02:09:07.740
LIAM: Demo.

02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:09.746
MARISHA: Demo-gorgon.

02:09:09.746 --> 02:09:11.710
LIAM: This could be yours in hell.

02:09:11.710 --> 02:09:13.386
MARISHA: Chat will get it.

02:09:13.386 --> 02:09:14.537
MATT: Chat will get it.

02:09:14.537 --> 02:29:08.358
[break]

02:29:08.599 --> 02:29:14.652
LIAM: It won't work this time. Hey guys! Welcome
back. So, right off the top, we have been doing

02:29:14.652 --> 02:29:18.532
this show for hundreds and hundreds of hours, and
for the first time ever we have a player going

02:29:18.532 --> 02:29:25.278
home sick. Laura is tapping out. She probably has
got the same thing Brian Foster had. We'll all be

02:29:25.278 --> 02:29:26.750
next, yay.

02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:29.291
TRAVIS: Especially because we French kiss all the
time.

02:29:29.291 --> 02:29:36.061
LIAM: So, I'll miss twinnie, but I want twinnie to
be a part of the story, so I will include her.

02:29:36.061 --> 02:29:44.301
She'll be there, but not physically on set. What
else? So our winner for the dice vault over the

02:29:44.301 --> 02:29:49.601
break was YassieXD. YassieXD, you now have a
lovely box for your dice to put it in!

02:29:49.601 --> 02:29:51.025
MATT: Congrats.

02:29:51.025 --> 02:29:52.517
(cheering)

02:29:52.517 --> 02:29:57.151
LIAM: Man, I'm thrown. I'm thrown, my friend went
home. Oh, well. What else do we do now, do I just

02:29:57.151 --> 02:29:58.434
start? Is that what I do?

02:29:58.434 --> 02:29:59.531
MATT: Jump right in, motherfucker.

02:29:59.531 --> 02:30:00.690
LIAM: All right.

02:30:00.690 --> 02:30:04.067
TRAVIS: Everybody's dead, so...

02:30:04.067 --> 02:30:06.572
MARISHA: So we're all dead?

02:30:06.572 --> 02:30:08.060
SAM: Good game, good game.

02:30:08.060 --> 02:30:09.524
LIAM: This is the post-mortem.

02:30:09.524 --> 02:30:12.942
MARISHA: We built Dis post-mortem?

02:30:12.942 --> 02:30:15.732
SAM: Nope.

02:30:15.732 --> 02:30:18.309
LIAM: Darkness.

02:30:18.309 --> 02:30:20.143
SAM: Darkness.

02:30:20.143 --> 02:30:42.529
LIAM: Quiet. You have no sense of time. Minutes,
days, you don't know. A voice barks out, "Okay,

02:30:42.599 --> 02:30:51.243
"that was really good, let's go right back into
another one." Ashley, your eyes flutter open and

02:30:51.295 --> 02:31:01.866
squint in the glare of bright white light from all
sides. They adjust. "Guys, we good? I wanna go

02:31:01.866 --> 02:31:10.383
"right into another." You look around. You're lying
in a large white room. The walls are padded with

02:31:10.383 --> 02:31:12.394
soft cloth material.

02:31:12.394 --> 02:31:14.243
TALIESIN: Oh no.

02:31:14.243 --> 02:31:15.348
LIAM: Ashley, you sit up--

02:31:15.348 --> 02:31:16.615
ASHLEY: This is my nightmare!

02:31:16.615 --> 02:31:26.804
LIAM: -- and see Neil? Naughty Dog creative
director Neil Druckmann?

02:31:26.804 --> 02:31:29.408
(laughter)

02:31:29.408 --> 02:31:36.466
LIAM: Walking over towards you. You realize there
are cameras everywhere, lining the walls, there's

02:31:36.466 --> 02:31:43.822
monitors nearby, cables. You see a very familiar
crew at their stations. You look down. Oh, shit.

02:31:43.822 --> 02:31:52.253
P-cap suit. You are in a full performance-capture
suit. You are all lying on your backs in full

02:31:52.253 --> 02:32:00.060
performance-capture suits, and you're still
fucking kids?

02:32:00.060 --> 02:32:04.484
(laughter)

02:32:04.484 --> 02:32:09.404
LIAM: Neil, with his glorious beard, walks up, but
calls out over his shoulder, says, "Liam, I'm

02:32:09.404 --> 02:32:13.822
"sorry, don't get too comfortable, we're going to
move on to your scene pretty soon. Don't pass out

02:32:13.822 --> 02:32:21.373
"on me." And you see over on the lounge-y area, a
pair of shoes lying off the side of a couch, and

02:32:21.373 --> 02:32:28.870
you hear a dorky voice say, "Got it. Okay."
"Ashley, Ashley, can I grab a word over here?"

02:32:28.870 --> 02:32:31.021
ASHLEY: Yes. Yes, please.

02:32:31.021 --> 02:32:32.762
LIAM: He's ahead of you, though, by like 20 feet.

02:32:32.762 --> 02:32:33.992
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:32:33.992 --> 02:32:38.673
LIAM: You walk over and you see he's doing that
thing where he's standing on the outside of his

02:32:38.673 --> 02:32:48.852
feet, looking down. When he senses that you've
walked up, he says, "Question. For the first line

02:32:48.873 --> 02:32:52.795
"of this scene, what are you feeling right now?"

02:32:52.795 --> 02:33:02.529
ASHLEY: I'm feeling... confused.

02:33:02.529 --> 02:33:04.380
LIAM: "Okay."

02:33:04.380 --> 02:33:13.807
ASHLEY: A little... I think I just need... How are
you feeling about it? Like, what are you feeling--

02:33:13.807 --> 02:33:18.805
what is missing? What's going on?

02:33:18.805 --> 02:33:22.828
LIAM: Let me just interject as the Dungeon Master
and let you know that he is not showing any

02:33:22.828 --> 02:33:25.775
recognition that you are 14 at all.

02:33:25.775 --> 02:33:27.126
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:33:27.126 --> 02:33:33.737
LIAM: At all. "I don't know, I mean, I think that
was just the first take, I shouldn't second-guess

02:33:33.737 --> 02:33:39.135
"myself, but do you think that that line is
something that you would say?"

02:33:39.135 --> 02:33:47.716
ASHLEY: Is that line something I would say? Is
there-- maybe if it just sounded weird-- maybe

02:33:47.716 --> 02:33:51.655
there's another way to say it? If you had to just
spitball, what would be another way that I could

02:33:51.655 --> 02:33:53.381
say it?

02:33:53.453 --> 02:34:05.428
LIAM: "Okay. This time, I want you to..." Strokes
his beard. "Doubt."

02:34:05.428 --> 02:34:07.971
ASHLEY: Doubt.

02:34:07.971 --> 02:34:10.812
LIAM: "I mean, I don't want to give you--"

02:34:10.812 --> 02:34:13.809
ASHLEY: Do you have the sides on you, actually? Do
you have the script on you?

02:34:13.809 --> 02:34:21.809
LIAM: "Colla, could we get the sides in for
everybody?" Colla comes running in. You guys are

02:34:21.809 --> 02:34:26.226
all getting up to your feet, also kids in full
performance-capture suits.

02:34:26.226 --> 02:34:28.362
MATT: I just...

02:34:28.362 --> 02:34:30.279
SAM and LIAM: Aww.

02:34:30.279 --> 02:34:37.842
LIAM: Everyone's taller than you. Bill Beemer
comes running over, and he starts going, "Gah,

02:34:37.842 --> 02:34:42.672
"this is weird," but he hands out sides to you all.
You can open your envelopes now,

02:34:42.672 --> 02:34:44.124
looking at sides.

02:34:44.124 --> 02:34:48.412
MARISHA: Are these sides? Yeah!

02:34:48.412 --> 02:34:50.922
MATT: Inspire Bill Beemer?

02:34:50.922 --> 02:34:58.991
LIAM: And you start reminding yourselves of the
scene that you've never seen before. Yeah, yeah,

02:34:58.991 --> 02:35:03.331
absorb that. Ashley, while you're reading, out of
the corner of your eye you see Neil off on the

02:35:03.331 --> 02:35:09.971
side just sorta like flipping a prop knife over
and over again absent-mindedly while he thinks.

02:35:09.971 --> 02:35:11.741
Drops it.

02:35:11.741 --> 02:35:14.427
ASHLEY: Can I-- Neil.

02:35:14.427 --> 02:35:15.983
LIAM: "Yeah."

02:35:15.983 --> 02:35:19.394
ASHLEY: Can I have that prop knife?

02:35:19.394 --> 02:35:21.004
LIAM: "Sure."

02:35:21.004 --> 02:35:26.093
ASHLEY: I just wanna see if it'll make the scene
any different.

02:35:26.093 --> 02:35:28.809
(laughter)

02:35:28.809 --> 02:35:30.666
SAM: Such a good actor.

02:35:30.666 --> 02:35:39.685
LIAM: "Are you guys good? Laura, your accent kind
of wandered just a little bit,

02:35:39.685 --> 02:35:41.575
"you want me to get J.B.?"

02:35:41.575 --> 02:35:44.585
(laughter)

02:35:44.585 --> 02:35:47.447
MATT: Now this has become her nightmare.

02:35:47.447 --> 02:35:56.089
LIAM: Laura makes the most stinkface you've ever
seen. She says, "No, I'm good." From her very

02:35:56.089 --> 02:36:02.199
short stature. "I was just a little off that
time."

02:36:02.199 --> 02:36:07.078
"Okay, do we wanna go for another one? Is
everyone feeling--"

02:36:07.078 --> 02:36:09.457
ASHLEY: Can I-- hey, Liam?

02:36:09.457 --> 02:36:11.338
LIAM: "Yeah?"

02:36:11.338 --> 02:36:14.727
ASHLEY: Can you come here for just like two
seconds?

02:36:14.727 --> 02:36:16.820
LIAM: "Okay."

02:36:16.820 --> 02:36:19.732
MATT: As this is happening, I walk up to Neil, I'm
like, by the way, I know we've met a number of

02:36:19.732 --> 02:36:22.207
times, but I just wanna tell you, it's a great
pleasure to finally have an opportunity to work

02:36:22.207 --> 02:36:23.170
with you.

02:36:23.170 --> 02:36:25.824
(laughter)

02:36:25.824 --> 02:36:33.430
MARISHA: And I walk up behind and I go, hi. I'm
his girlfriend. (nervous laugh)

02:36:33.430 --> 02:36:41.344
LIAM: (whispers) You know you're already on the
job, right? That was me. Neil says, "Oh, of

02:36:41.344 --> 02:36:46.167
"course, of course, I mean yeah, yeah. I'm sorry,
what were you saying?"

02:36:46.167 --> 02:36:49.102
ASHLEY: I just wanted to talk to Liam for just
like two seconds.

02:36:49.102 --> 02:36:52.676
LIAM: Yeah, Liam's already wandered up. He's in
full performance-capture suit. He's an adult.

02:36:52.676 --> 02:36:56.338
Yeah. And he's looking down, but whatever.

02:36:56.338 --> 02:37:09.267
ASHLEY: (laughs) I just-- I forgot what I was
gonna ask. It's fine. I just wanted to-- I was

02:37:09.267 --> 02:37:15.210
gonna ask you something, but I forgot. It's good
to see you. Good to see you. Go back to bed.

02:37:15.210 --> 02:37:18.032
LIAM: "We're all glad to have you back in town.
I'm gonna go back to the couch."

02:37:18.032 --> 02:37:23.717
TRAVIS: Hey, wait, wait, before you go, Liam. What
do we look like to you?

02:37:23.717 --> 02:37:26.391
LIAM: "Assholes." Walks back to the couch.

02:37:26.391 --> 02:37:27.610
TALIESIN: Fuck.

02:37:27.610 --> 02:37:28.581
ASHLEY: Wait.

02:37:28.581 --> 02:37:30.028
LIAM: "Yeah?"

02:37:30.028 --> 02:37:35.395
ASHLEY: If you had to guess how old I was, what
would you guess?

02:37:35.395 --> 02:37:37.969
LIAM: "This seems like a dangerous question to
me."

02:37:37.969 --> 02:37:40.449
ASHLEY: Don't let it be dangerous. I can take it.

02:37:40.449 --> 02:37:41.315
LIAM: "Really?"

02:37:41.315 --> 02:37:44.359
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah. Straight-up, how old do you
think I look?

02:37:44.359 --> 02:37:47.071
LIAM: "I feel like there's no right answer to give
to this question?"

02:37:47.071 --> 02:37:48.556
ASHLEY: There's no right answer.

02:37:48.556 --> 02:37:56.218
LIAM: "You're-- I mean, I know it's early 30s.
33?"

02:37:56.218 --> 02:37:58.420
ASHLEY: Bingo.

02:37:58.420 --> 02:38:02.601
LIAM: "Hey!" And he does a little dance and just
dances his way back up to the couch area,

02:38:02.601 --> 02:38:04.526
lands down.

02:38:04.526 --> 02:38:06.105
ASHLEY: Guys.

02:38:06.105 --> 02:38:10.969
SAM: I guess people see us as super-old.

02:38:10.969 --> 02:38:15.401
MARISHA: Or super-professional! Look at this
velcro suit!

02:38:15.401 --> 02:38:17.662
SAM: Oh, you don't wear these?

02:38:17.662 --> 02:38:21.354
MARISHA: Like once. And then the game got
canceled, so what's it matter?

02:38:21.354 --> 02:38:27.697
LIAM: "Guys. Guys. I mean, do we need to talk this
scene out, or do you want to do another one, or?"

02:38:27.697 --> 02:38:31.011
ASHLEY: We're...

02:38:31.011 --> 02:38:34.741
SAM: We're professionals, we're gonna do this.

02:38:34.741 --> 02:38:37.913
TRAVIS: I don't wanna speak for Laura, but she
doesn't really like to rehearse beforehand,

02:38:37.913 --> 02:38:38.797
she just--

02:38:38.797 --> 02:38:40.067
ASHLEY: Let's just jump right in.

02:38:40.067 --> 02:38:41.030
LIAM: "Jump right in?"

02:38:41.030 --> 02:38:42.526
ASHLEY: I'm sure we're gonna have notes again.

02:38:42.526 --> 02:38:47.544
LIAM: "Okay, we're gonna take another one, uno
mas." Bill Beemer--

02:38:47.544 --> 02:38:54.857
MATT: Is it general T-pose, or A-T-pose? Okay.
T-pose.

02:38:54.857 --> 02:38:57.962
LIAM: "You're good." Bill Beemer comes out and
says,

02:38:57.962 --> 02:39:03.868
"All right, Savage Starlight, scene 23B,
take two. Audio rolling."

02:39:03.868 --> 02:39:05.676
MATT: Guys, wait!

02:39:05.676 --> 02:39:12.422
LIAM: "Camera rolling. Okay, Neil, the floor is
yours." He wanders off, Neil backs off at the

02:39:12.422 --> 02:39:16.918
volume, off to the edge on the wall, out of the
way, and says, "Okay, the deck has just blown up.

02:39:16.918 --> 02:39:21.510
"First position. And action."

02:39:21.510 --> 02:39:31.343
ASHLEY: "You knew this was gonna happen. The
entire time, you were biding your time, and now

02:39:31.343 --> 02:39:33.880
"you're driving this fleet into the ground!"

02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:40.768
MATT: "The Federation is crumbling. You know that.
Everyone on this ship knows it. You can't stop the

02:39:40.768 --> 02:39:42.480
"inevitable, Cass."

02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:47.318
SAM: (yells in pain) Pickup. (yells in pain)

02:39:47.318 --> 02:39:48.520
TALIESIN: "Commander Bettany--"

02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:53.270
SAM: Pickup. (yells in pain) "Oh, god!"

02:39:53.270 --> 02:39:57.607
TALIESIN: "Commander Bettany! Fenton, he's hurt,
bad!"

02:39:57.607 --> 02:40:01.052
MARISHA: "We're not gonna have a problem here, are
we, Commander?"

02:40:01.052 --> 02:40:04.806
TRAVIS: "Well, that's gonna fucking depend on you,
isn't it?"

02:40:04.806 --> 02:40:08.356
MATT: "Well? What's it gonna be, Cass?"

02:40:08.356 --> 02:40:11.560
ASHLEY: "God damn it!"

02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:19.993
LIAM: Laura runs in from the side. "Cass! He set
it loose! Argus! He's killed us all!" She's 12.

02:40:19.993 --> 02:40:25.042
"Explosion!"

02:40:25.042 --> 02:40:27.896
(yelling)

02:40:27.896 --> 02:40:29.979
MATT: All right, T-pose.

02:40:29.979 --> 02:40:32.320
SAM: Man, her South African accent is terrible.

02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:33.661
(laughter)

02:40:33.661 --> 02:40:35.558
TALIESIN: All over the place.

02:40:35.558 --> 02:40:42.607
LIAM: Neil is laughing off to the side, and says,
"Okay, did we get the April Fools' take out of the

02:40:42.607 --> 02:40:44.880
"way? I mean, I don't understand."

02:40:44.880 --> 02:40:47.642
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:40:47.642 --> 02:40:50.679
ASHLEY: Yeah, we can do it for real. I think--

02:40:50.679 --> 02:40:53.612
MARISHA: That was just rehearsal, right?

02:40:53.612 --> 02:40:57.473
LIAM: "Yeah, it's all rehearsal, is kind of the
mindset."

02:40:57.473 --> 02:40:59.901
ASHLEY: Anything else you want us to do?

02:40:59.901 --> 02:41:07.850
LIAM: "Well, I mean, I don't want to give you a
result-oriented direction, but.

02:41:07.850 --> 02:41:11.801
"Come over here for a second."

02:41:11.801 --> 02:41:14.589
ASHLEY: You do him so good.

02:41:14.589 --> 02:41:17.651
(laughter)

02:41:17.651 --> 02:41:19.402
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:41:19.402 --> 02:41:27.110
LIAM: "So I want it to come from you." I'm looking
for something in these notes, I can't find it.

02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:38.535
"And, you know, this time, when you're confronting
him, don't look right at him, look back at your

02:41:38.535 --> 02:41:42.704
"men. And let's just see what that does."

02:41:42.704 --> 02:41:44.413
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:41:44.413 --> 02:41:47.762
LIAM: "Sam, do you have the line?"

02:41:47.762 --> 02:41:53.783
SAM: Yeah, I got it now. Sorry, Neil. I didn't
know if it was "oh lord!" or "oh god!" I got in my

02:41:53.783 --> 02:41:56.220
head, and that's not a place you want me to be.

02:41:56.220 --> 02:42:00.468
LIAM: "Well, that's okay, even if you lose the
lines, just play it through to the end. You know,

02:42:00.468 --> 02:42:02.638
"we can use it."

02:42:02.638 --> 02:42:04.707
SAM: Hey, can I see you for a second?

02:42:04.707 --> 02:42:05.898
LIAM: "Sure."

02:42:05.898 --> 02:42:10.224
SAM: Laura's accent is really throwing me. That's
gonna be fixed later, right?

02:42:10.224 --> 02:42:13.434
LIAM: "Yeah."

02:42:13.434 --> 02:42:16.219
SAM: Okay, okay. I can do this.

02:42:16.219 --> 02:42:20.567
LIAM: Shakes his head, walks back to the side.

02:42:20.567 --> 02:42:22.107
TRAVIS: Bill? Beemer?

02:42:22.107 --> 02:42:23.379
LIAM: "Yeah?"

02:42:23.379 --> 02:42:28.436
TRAVIS: Hey, Bill, what time is it, man? How long
have we been here?

02:42:28.436 --> 02:42:33.521
LIAM: "Two hours? What is it, 9:30?"

02:42:33.521 --> 02:42:35.631
TRAVIS: 9:30, okay, yeah.

02:42:35.631 --> 02:42:37.123
MARISHA: 405 traffic.

02:42:37.123 --> 02:42:39.403
TRAVIS: Right, okay.

02:42:39.403 --> 02:42:46.711
LIAM: "Okay, okay, I feel like we're losing
momentum, so let's just do one more, we'll go one

02:42:46.711 --> 02:42:54.102
"more time. Bill?" And Bill comes out and says,
"All right, Savage Starlight, scene 23B, take

02:42:54.102 --> 02:43:07.114
"four. Audio rolling. Camera rolling. All right.
You're good to go."

02:43:07.114 --> 02:43:12.847
And Neil shouts, "Explosion! And action."

02:43:12.847 --> 02:43:18.118
ASHLEY: "You knew this was gonna happen. The
entire time, you were biding your time, and now you're

02:43:18.118 --> 02:43:20.261
"driving this fleet to the ground!"

02:43:20.261 --> 02:43:27.586
MATT: "The Federation is crumbling. You know that.
Everyone on this ship knows it. You can't stop the

02:43:27.586 --> 02:43:28.975
"inevitable, Cass."

02:43:28.975 --> 02:43:32.640
SAM: (yells in pain) "Oh, god! Oh, god!"

02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:37.695
TALIESIN: "Commander Bettany! Fenton, he's hurt.
Bad."

02:43:37.695 --> 02:43:46.433
LIAM: Right at that moment, you feel the same
sickening nauseating pull on your every nerve,

02:43:46.433 --> 02:43:54.862
your guts feel like they're going to drop out of
your body, and an invisible wall of force, like a

02:43:54.862 --> 02:44:03.877
sheet of radiation pushes its way through your
body, and as it does so, the ground around you,

02:44:03.877 --> 02:44:12.262
the walls of the performance-capture studio split
and break in places, and tendrils of cable, oily

02:44:12.262 --> 02:44:18.967
and slick, spatter out like a digusting birth of
pythons wriggling and spreading out on the floor.

02:44:18.967 --> 02:44:26.644
And the wall's a techno-organic orgy spewing with
malice all around you. The camera equipment around

02:44:26.644 --> 02:44:35.693
you begins to twist and break and reconfigure in
disjointed movements, reforming into broken,

02:44:35.693 --> 02:44:44.096
misshapen, spider-like legs, masses of metal and
power cables either cut loose from them or spool

02:44:44.096 --> 02:44:53.606
around their bodies, these things. Before you can
react, you watch as Colla, the cameraman, is

02:44:53.606 --> 02:44:59.871
pushed down onto the ground and mangled by
spinning metallic arms on the bottom of what used

02:44:59.871 --> 02:45:01.322
to be a camera.

02:45:01.322 --> 02:45:03.252
TRAVIS: He's ripped!

02:45:03.252 --> 02:45:11.053
LIAM: Neil, stunned, backs up. "I-- I-- I--" Roll
for initiative.

02:45:11.053 --> 02:45:12.923
(yelling)

02:45:12.923 --> 02:45:14.084
SAM: What are we fighting?

02:45:14.084 --> 02:45:15.181
ASHLEY: Are fighting Colla?

02:45:15.181 --> 02:45:17.590
MARISHA: But the sides were so mediocre!

02:45:17.590 --> 02:45:20.983
TALIESIN: Oh no. Oh no.

02:45:20.983 --> 02:45:25.595
SAM: What are we fighting?

02:45:25.595 --> 02:45:34.216
TRAVIS: (laughs) It's actually-- you fucking made
it. It's Sony.

02:45:34.216 --> 02:45:35.954
MATT: Yeah, it is.

02:45:35.954 --> 02:45:39.804
MARISHA: Oh my god, it is. Look! Look, it's the
control room!

02:45:39.804 --> 02:45:42.624
MATT: I love that it has the volume tape and
everything. It's so good.

02:45:42.624 --> 02:45:46.696
LIAM: This is a miniature of Rasputin. And now
it's Neil Druckmann.

02:45:46.696 --> 02:45:49.759
(laughter)

02:45:49.759 --> 02:45:52.560
MATT: I feel like you have to give him that after
this, now.

02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:57.351
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, I think that's-- won't be
needing that anymore. Okay. So. Oh, Neil needs to

02:45:57.351 --> 02:45:59.428
roll for-- and so does Laura.

02:45:59.428 --> 02:46:01.380
MARISHA: Where's Crafty?

02:46:01.380 --> 02:46:02.776
TRAVIS: Outside, unfortunately.

02:46:02.776 --> 02:46:07.749
MARISHA: God damn, every time, and we have to
share it with the other stage. Bullshit.

02:46:07.749 --> 02:46:10.212
SAM: Ashley has a prop knife.

02:46:10.212 --> 02:46:12.629
LIAM: Okay, 20 to 25?

02:46:12.629 --> 02:46:14.624
ASHLEY: 20.

02:46:14.624 --> 02:46:18.198
LIAM: Yeah? Okay. 15 to 20?

02:46:18.198 --> 02:46:19.340
MATT: 18.

02:46:19.340 --> 02:46:22.022
LIAM: 18. Ten to 15?

02:46:22.022 --> 02:46:23.657
MARISHA: 14.

02:46:23.657 --> 02:46:36.473
LIAM: Five to ten? Okay, so that is-- oh, I can do
Laura and Neil. And then zero to five?

02:46:36.473 --> 02:46:37.378
SAM: Three.

02:46:37.378 --> 02:46:38.205
TALIESIN: Two.

02:46:38.205 --> 02:46:39.483
TRAVIS: Natural one.

02:46:39.483 --> 02:46:40.584
LIAM: Whoa!

02:46:40.584 --> 02:46:42.346
MATT: Aw, buddy.

02:46:42.346 --> 02:46:55.336
LIAM: Three, two, one? Wow. Okay. Oh, okay. Okay.
So Colla is soup on the ground, and everything's

02:46:55.336 --> 02:47:04.802
broken and bent all around you. You also see one
of the computer banks up on the platform here, the

02:47:04.802 --> 02:47:10.500
computers have wrapped together and formed into a
sort of walking tank. Rickety, but has closed on

02:47:10.500 --> 02:47:16.487
the sofa, where Liam was taking a nap. What would
you like to do?

02:47:16.487 --> 02:47:20.777
ASHLEY: (laughs) Where am I?

02:47:20.777 --> 02:47:23.519
LIAM: Yeah, I'm gonna have to help you all. You
are right here.

02:47:23.519 --> 02:47:24.530
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:47:24.530 --> 02:47:26.265
SAM: And there's robits?

02:47:26.265 --> 02:47:29.939
LIAM: There's camera and mocap-- this thing came
out of the ground.

02:47:29.939 --> 02:47:31.106
SAM: What is it?

02:47:31.106 --> 02:47:32.384
LIAM: I don't know.

02:47:32.384 --> 02:47:33.930
SAM: What does it look like?

02:47:33.930 --> 02:47:41.225
LIAM: It looks like black poles and computer
monitor and cables and cords and exposed wiring

02:47:41.225 --> 02:47:48.514
and motherboards wrapped together, and rickety,
but moving, and everything else, these other ones,

02:47:48.514 --> 02:47:55.694
were things that were out and just wrapped
together. This broke out of the floor. And

02:47:55.694 --> 02:47:56.866
Ashley's right here.

02:47:56.866 --> 02:47:58.008
ASHLEY: And Colla's on the ground?

02:47:58.008 --> 02:48:00.876
LIAM: Colla is here, and is guts.

02:48:00.876 --> 02:48:02.122
ASHLEY: He's dead.

02:48:02.122 --> 02:48:04.931
LIAM: He's gone. The cameraman.

02:48:04.931 --> 02:48:14.644
ASHLEY: Sorry, Colla. And what's the other-- is
that just another camera? Behind? Yeah, that.

02:48:14.644 --> 02:48:20.923
LIAM: This is camera, camera, computers,
computers, nightmare-fuel.

02:48:20.923 --> 02:48:24.827
ASHLEY: So the thing that we're trying to kill is
that one? Or are all the cameras bad?

02:48:24.827 --> 02:48:26.399
We don't know.

02:48:26.399 --> 02:48:38.373
LIAM: And the crew that are scattered around on
the outskirts are running. All the people over

02:48:38.373 --> 02:48:41.924
here, I don't have minis for them all, but they're
all booking for the door.

02:48:41.924 --> 02:48:45.421
One person ran out here.

02:48:45.421 --> 02:48:47.087
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:48:47.087 --> 02:48:48.867
MARISHA: So they can see the crazy.

02:48:48.867 --> 02:48:50.994
LIAM: Everyone sees the crazy. You're still kids.

02:48:50.994 --> 02:48:55.362
MARISHA: According to us. No one else.

02:48:55.362 --> 02:49:01.238
LIAM: Can tell that you're kids? Yeah, no one has
acknowledged that you're kids, and they've got

02:49:01.238 --> 02:49:03.473
bigger fish to fry at the moment.

02:49:03.473 --> 02:49:04.845
MARISHA: Production.

02:49:04.845 --> 02:49:10.054
ASHLEY: Liam! Are you okay?

02:49:10.054 --> 02:49:12.715
LIAM: (shrieks)

02:49:12.715 --> 02:49:17.475
ASHLEY: I'll take that as a yes, 'cause that means
you're alive.

02:49:17.475 --> 02:49:19.286
TRAVIS: That was adult-Liam, too.

02:49:19.286 --> 02:49:20.763
MATT: Yeah. Yeah.

02:49:20.763 --> 02:49:23.471
LIAM: True to life. True to life.

02:49:23.471 --> 02:49:30.456
ASHLEY: Ah, man. How close can I get to one of the
cameras? The ones behind?

02:49:30.456 --> 02:49:35.373
LIAM: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25. You can get right up
on this one or this one. This one killed Colla.

02:49:35.373 --> 02:49:40.664
ASHLEY: Oh, shit. I don't have anything to do to
it. Oh, shoot, I don't know what to do!

02:49:40.664 --> 02:49:43.933
LIAM: Well, I'm gonna pass to Matt in another 20
seconds.

02:49:43.933 --> 02:49:44.862
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:49:44.862 --> 02:49:46.408
MARISHA: You're Ashley motherfucking Johnson.

02:49:46.408 --> 02:49:49.261
ASHLEY: I'm gonna try-- I don't know what-- that
doesn't mean-- are there any wires that're exposed

02:49:49.261 --> 02:49:50.519
on the biggie?

02:49:50.519 --> 02:49:52.286
TRAVIS: Take a bite out of Sam.

02:49:52.286 --> 02:49:57.570
LIAM: It's all wires. There's no hardened shell,
this isn't a military machine cased inside of

02:49:57.570 --> 02:50:00.904
armor, it's all just a mess of motherboard and
wires.

02:50:00.904 --> 02:50:04.840
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm gonna try to go to the big
camera.

02:50:04.840 --> 02:50:05.914
LIAM: Yeah.

02:50:05.914 --> 02:50:09.360
ASHLEY: And start yanking some wires, maybe where
I think it can't see me.

02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:16.447
LIAM: Okay. Where it can't see you? Okay. So
you're gonna reach out? Well, make an attack. Roll

02:50:16.447 --> 02:50:17.752
a d20.

02:50:17.752 --> 02:50:22.298
ASHLEY: Okay. And then what do I add to it?

02:50:22.298 --> 02:50:27.466
LIAM: Your strength modifier. Well, to hit? Yeah.

02:50:27.466 --> 02:50:36.270
ASHLEY: A nine. And I do add the strength? Okay.
Yeah, so, 11.

02:50:36.270 --> 02:50:40.352
LIAM: You get your hands on there and you pull,
and nothing fucking happens.

02:50:40.352 --> 02:50:46.828
ASHLEY: Shit. Knew I shouldn't have rolled that
one. I knew it was a bad die.

02:50:46.828 --> 02:50:48.409
LIAM: What do you wanna do, Matt?

02:50:48.409 --> 02:50:51.603
MATT: Just looking around at the ground, these
things are made of cables. Are there loose, slack

02:50:51.603 --> 02:50:53.428
cables that were once attached to the cameras?

02:50:53.428 --> 02:50:57.149
LIAM: Sure, there's a lot of shit scattered
around. When they formed, some pieces just fell

02:50:57.149 --> 02:51:00.020
away, so there's bits of pole and--

02:51:00.020 --> 02:51:07.610
MATT: Okay. I'm gonna move slightly around and
towards the consoles a bit, grabbing whatever

02:51:07.610 --> 02:51:10.990
looks to be longest, most slack non-attached
wire--

02:51:10.990 --> 02:51:12.289
LIAM: Wire, okay.

02:51:12.289 --> 02:51:16.676
MATT: And I'm gonna grab it and throw it up over
the scaffolding that holds the various mocap

02:51:16.676 --> 02:51:22.398
cameras there. Grab the other side and look back
to Marisha and be like, help me pull this onto it

02:51:22.398 --> 02:51:27.349
and start backing up towards her the rest of my
movement, holding the cables that are wrapped

02:51:27.349 --> 02:51:28.518
around the scaffolding.

02:51:28.518 --> 02:51:32.680
LIAM: Okay. I'm gonna say that that's your whole
turn, getting it primed and ready. Yes.

02:51:32.680 --> 02:51:33.818
MARISHA: What?

02:51:33.818 --> 02:51:35.867
MATT: Trying to pull the scaffolding onto it.

02:51:35.867 --> 02:51:37.575
LIAM: All right, Marisha.

02:51:37.575 --> 02:51:38.835
MARISHA: Huh?

02:51:38.835 --> 02:51:41.648
LIAM: 16-year-old in a mocap suit. What do you
want to do?

02:51:41.648 --> 02:51:56.383
MARISHA: I thought I'd be famous by now. Okay.
Wait. What? You're pulling-- okay. I'm gonna look

02:51:56.383 --> 02:51:58.469
for its power source.

02:51:58.469 --> 02:52:01.560
LIAM: All right. Make an investigation check.

02:52:01.560 --> 02:52:04.053
SAM: There's a diesel engine.

02:52:04.053 --> 02:52:07.352
MARISHA: Aw, that's not too bad. 14.

02:52:07.352 --> 02:52:16.684
LIAM: 14. Well, there is-- I mean, it's climbing
out of a gap in the ground, right? And there is a

02:52:16.684 --> 02:52:26.215
sickly green light glowing from under its butt.
And there are also, you see, two little screens.

02:52:26.215 --> 02:52:32.750
You see a broken fragment of monitor, and then a
very small, almost like a flip-up on a camera

02:52:32.750 --> 02:52:41.700
screen, and on it you see the word flicker on,
"NO". And then it disappears. And you see the

02:52:41.700 --> 02:52:47.899
same-- and it's like a pale green. And you see
that same color glowing from underneath this big,

02:52:47.899 --> 02:52:49.893
spherical body.

02:52:49.893 --> 02:53:02.551
MARISHA: Is there a cord connected to that? No?
Ah, jeez. Okay. I say, I feel like this is a

02:53:02.551 --> 02:53:10.498
really shitty update. And then I'm gonna try and
punch it in its face.

02:53:10.498 --> 02:53:13.081
SAM: Punch the camera.

02:53:13.081 --> 02:53:17.855
LIAM: So Matt is there going, come on, come on,
and she just runs up and starts fucking whaling on

02:53:17.855 --> 02:53:19.047
it like a brawler.

02:53:19.047 --> 02:53:21.301
MATT: Yeah, no, this is a familiar duality, here.

02:53:21.301 --> 02:53:23.018
LIAM: Yeah, that's about right.

02:53:23.018 --> 02:53:24.865
MATT: I have a plan, what are you-- okay.

02:53:24.865 --> 02:53:26.137
MARISHA: Ten for the first one.

02:53:26.137 --> 02:53:27.892
LIAM: What about the second? Just roll for both.

02:53:27.892 --> 02:53:34.454
MARISHA: Second one is real bad. Real bad. That's
a four. No, five.

02:53:34.454 --> 02:53:38.894
LIAM: Okay, you just start whaling-- and you've
trained, you know some martial arts, so you pull

02:53:38.894 --> 02:53:39.896
out some of your--

02:53:39.896 --> 02:53:41.256
MARISHA: No, no, five plus two. Seven.

02:53:41.256 --> 02:53:45.758
LIAM: Okay, you pull out a little bit of your
training, and you get (impact sounds) and it

02:53:45.758 --> 02:53:51.331
fucking hurts your knuckles and you dented it and
it just goes (whirring sounds) and that's the end

02:53:51.331 --> 02:53:53.077
of your turn.

02:53:53.077 --> 02:53:57.837
MARISHA: Fuck, this is like a claw machine! Fuck
that, it's rigged. (yells)

02:53:57.837 --> 02:54:02.507
MATT: As you do that, I'm like, I told you to-- my
dick's in the wind, here, somebody help me!

02:54:02.507 --> 02:54:14.097
LIAM: Laura screams, Neil! Run! And she runs at
this thing and grabs a piece of-- like the end of

02:54:14.097 --> 02:54:20.285
a tripod, like a tripod leg from a camera, she
picks it up and swings down and whacks at this

02:54:20.285 --> 02:54:31.970
thing and hurts it. She smashes off this, whatever
this spherical piece is, so it's without a top.

02:54:31.970 --> 02:54:39.649
And she gets, okay. Good. You guys don't need to
know. All right, she smashes it and a whole piece

02:54:39.649 --> 02:54:45.728
breaks off. They're not-- except for this guy--
they're not that solidly built, and she snaps the

02:54:45.728 --> 02:54:51.141
connection where this round part is, and it breaks
off and hangs limply, but it's still moving, it

02:54:51.141 --> 02:54:56.906
goes, (whirring sounds).

02:54:56.906 --> 02:54:58.929
TRAVIS: Get him out of the volume!

02:54:58.929 --> 02:55:05.440
LIAM: Neil runs over and he just jumps on top of
it. Because one of his favorite friends is there.

02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:15.689
Oh, man. I'm sorry, Neil. You rolled a natural
one. He jumps and climbs and scrabbles up it and

02:55:15.689 --> 02:55:22.949
goes, (yells), and his beard is just blowing in
the wind that doesn't exist, and his foot slips

02:55:22.949 --> 02:55:29.093
and he falls backward and lands flat on his back
and knocks the wind out of himself. And has just

02:55:29.093 --> 02:55:36.540
fallen prone on the ground. It was a one. Sam,
what do you wanna do?

02:55:36.540 --> 02:55:42.561
SAM: I'm going to go assist Matt in what his plan
was. So are we grabbing the same thing and

02:55:42.561 --> 02:55:43.658
pulling?

02:55:43.658 --> 02:55:46.488
MATT: Yeah, the cables have wrapped around the
scaffolding that holds the mocap cameras, and

02:55:46.488 --> 02:55:48.794
trying to pull it down onto the large IMC to pin
it.

02:55:48.794 --> 02:55:51.432
SAM: I'm gonna pull hard. Real hard.

02:55:51.432 --> 02:55:55.606
LIAM: Okay. Make a strength check with advantage.

02:55:55.606 --> 02:55:59.885
SAM: Yeah, sure. Okay, terrible.

02:55:59.885 --> 02:56:01.588
MATT: You still have your bardic inspiration.

02:56:01.588 --> 02:56:06.859
SAM: I do. I'll use it. That helps. Plus
strength?

02:56:06.859 --> 02:56:08.013
LIAM: Strength.

02:56:08.013 --> 02:56:09.353
SAM: Okay, that's ten.

02:56:09.353 --> 02:56:12.140
LIAM: A ten? That's the number I was imagining.

02:56:12.140 --> 02:56:17.773
SAM: Oh wait, no. Five plus one plus six is 12.

02:56:17.773 --> 02:56:24.052
LIAM: 12. You guys, at the same time, go (effort
sounds), and you pull, and the thing goes

02:56:24.052 --> 02:56:31.474
(shrieking metal), and a huge piece of it swings
down and goes in an arch and smacks into-- I think

02:56:31.474 --> 02:56:35.324
you were maybe imagining bringing the whole thing
down, but you broke it, and a piece swings down and

02:56:35.324 --> 02:56:37.819
goes (impact sound). Smashes into it for--

02:56:37.870 --> 02:56:39.431
SAM: Hey, it's good.

02:56:39.431 --> 02:56:40.851
LIAM: Okay.

02:56:40.851 --> 02:56:43.737
MARISHA: I'm still looking for a mini-USB port.

02:56:43.737 --> 02:56:48.584
LIAM: Smashes into the side and breaks away one of
five-- I know that's four-- but one of five legs

02:56:48.584 --> 02:56:55.645
totally snaps and breaks off, and Sam, as you yank
and you watch it smash into it and it rights

02:56:55.645 --> 02:57:01.299
itself, you see the same two screens, the fragment
of one, and the little one that Marisha saw, and

02:57:01.299 --> 02:57:07.913
you see a name blink up, and it says, "SAM", and
it's gone. Taliesin.

02:57:07.913 --> 02:57:16.569
TALIESIN: This is still a dream, so I'm going to
see if this thing still works.

02:57:16.569 --> 02:57:19.096
LIAM: Go for it, yeah, absolutely.

02:57:19.096 --> 02:57:22.659
TALIESIN: Is the one that Laura attacked still
looking dangerous, or is it just looking

02:57:22.659 --> 02:57:23.888
irritated?

02:57:23.888 --> 02:57:30.120
LIAM: It looked kind of fucked up from the get-go,
but it looks majorly fucked up, a couple of sparks

02:57:30.120 --> 02:57:32.340
fly off of it just as you look.

02:57:32.340 --> 02:57:36.702
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to go to the one that no
one's messed with and just hope that this is still

02:57:36.702 --> 02:57:37.900
gonna work.

02:57:37.900 --> 02:57:40.109
LIAM: Okay, make a ranged attack.

02:57:40.109 --> 02:57:42.501
MATT: Yeah, it's not focus-fire.

02:57:42.501 --> 02:57:44.059
TALIESIN: That's a 23.

02:57:44.059 --> 02:57:52.061
LIAM: Yeah, your eyes glow a dark blackish-purple.
This is the life you were meant for, Taliesin

02:57:52.061 --> 02:57:58.241
Jaffe. And you don't slam your hand down into the
ground. You're going for this guy, right?

02:57:58.241 --> 02:57:59.578
TALIESIN: I was going for the other one.

02:57:59.578 --> 02:58:00.466
LIAM: The big one?

02:58:00.466 --> 02:58:01.986
TALIESIN: No, the one in the far corner.

02:58:01.986 --> 02:58:06.156
LIAM: The far corner? Oh, okay. You still don't
put your hand on the ground, you just reach out of

02:58:06.156 --> 02:58:14.030
anger, you're so furious that fucking demogorgon
didn't take your bargain, and a long spaghetti arm

02:58:14.030 --> 02:58:22.633
of hentai lashes out from your hand and reaches
across the room and spikes through its "head",

02:58:22.633 --> 02:58:25.876
seemingly. Roll for damage.

02:58:25.876 --> 02:58:27.211
SAM: Two.

02:58:27.211 --> 02:58:28.498
TALIESIN: Four.

02:58:28.498 --> 02:58:35.581
LIAM: Four. It goes right through the heart of it
and breaks the connection from what would be its

02:58:35.581 --> 02:58:41.181
head if it was a head, and it swings down and
hangs limply from the side, and it starts to juke

02:58:41.181 --> 02:58:45.041
to the side here. It's still standing.

02:58:45.041 --> 02:58:49.109
TALIESIN: Liam, are you okay? And I'm going to run
just to the edge of the volume.

02:58:49.109 --> 02:58:52.403
LIAM: Okay. Travis, you're up.

02:58:52.403 --> 02:58:53.920
TRAVIS: Well, where am I?

02:58:53.920 --> 02:58:55.412
LIAM: You are here.

02:58:55.412 --> 02:59:02.611
TRAVIS: Right there. I'm gonna take off the
certainly at this point very hot battery pack that

02:59:02.611 --> 02:59:10.793
is attached to my stomach, peel it off the velcro,
and I'm gonna run at the giant arachnid demon

02:59:10.793 --> 02:59:14.964
thing and I'm gonna bash one of its legs with the
hot battery.

02:59:14.964 --> 02:59:20.194
LIAM: Okay. All right, roll for an attack.

02:59:20.194 --> 02:59:23.613
TRAVIS: 14.

02:59:23.613 --> 02:59:34.338
LIAM: You smash it with this piece of equipment,
and the equipment in your hand breaks into pieces

02:59:34.338 --> 02:59:38.055
and does nothing.

02:59:38.055 --> 02:59:43.592
TRAVIS: Yeah. Cool. Nice. Can I look up at it, see
if it flashes anything at me?

02:59:43.592 --> 02:59:50.130
LIAM: It doesn't do anything. Another day in hell,
Travis, another day in hell. And it goes (whirring

02:59:50.130 --> 02:59:58.302
noises) and two legs go (mechanical noises) and
dig into the side of your body.

02:59:58.302 --> 03:00:01.425
(yelling)

03:00:01.425 --> 03:00:04.108
LIAM: What's your armor class?

03:00:04.108 --> 03:00:06.153
TRAVIS: 12.

03:00:06.153 --> 03:00:14.977
LIAM: Okay. Too bad, so sad. All right. One stabs
into your thigh right here, and one goes in right

03:00:15.161 --> 03:00:19.544
under your armpit, and you can feel them dig in,
and each goes in-- again, these things are scary,

03:00:19.544 --> 03:00:25.458
I mean, camera equipment is not supposed to move
on its own, but they're not mecha from Metal

03:00:25.458 --> 03:00:30.546
Gear-- but you are stabbed here and here, and it
slices in about an inch and a half on each side.

03:00:30.546 --> 03:00:32.671
You take two points of damage.

03:00:32.671 --> 03:00:34.657
TRAVIS: That's a lot for me.

03:00:34.657 --> 03:00:45.339
LIAM: Off in the distance, you hear (whirring
sounds), and then you hear (screams, gurgling).

03:00:45.339 --> 03:00:50.301
SAM: Liam's dead. That's okay.

03:00:50.301 --> 03:00:53.730
TALIESIN: That's okay. He would've wanted it that
way. Wait.

03:00:53.730 --> 03:00:56.420
SAM: He slowed us down.

03:00:56.420 --> 03:00:58.627
MATT: To be fair, he wrote this. So.

03:00:58.627 --> 03:01:03.590
LIAM: This thing is broken and tries to-- raises a
leg up, it goes (whirring sounds) and brings it

03:01:03.590 --> 03:01:09.002
down at Druckmann and slams it down, and Druckmann
goes (effort sounds) and he rolls out of the way

03:01:09.002 --> 03:01:21.120
of one and is missed. And then this thing. Oh.
What's your armor class?

03:01:21.120 --> 03:01:24.499
ASHLEY: I'm sure you beat it by that 'oh'. 12.

03:01:24.499 --> 03:01:33.721
LIAM: 12. Yes. You feel a broken sharp-edged
tripod leg stab through here and come out here.

03:01:33.721 --> 03:01:37.108
You take five hit points of damage. You are
bleeding profusely from

03:01:37.108 --> 03:01:38.956
the front of yourself now.

03:01:38.956 --> 03:01:42.004
TRAVIS: Five, that's a lot.

03:01:42.004 --> 03:01:43.834
SAM: You okay there?

03:01:43.834 --> 03:01:49.320
LIAM: And, funnily enough, it's the top of round.
So what would you like to do with an arm still

03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:51.452
pushed through your body?

03:01:51.452 --> 03:01:54.072
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:01:54.072 --> 03:01:55.875
LIAM: It hurts.

03:01:55.875 --> 03:02:02.612
ASHLEY: I can't take it out 'cause I'll bleed out.
Is there any way to break off the arm?

03:02:02.612 --> 03:02:04.729
LIAM: Sure, you can hit that motherfucker.

03:02:04.729 --> 03:02:09.204
ASHLEY: All right. I'm gonna use my mocap knife.

03:02:09.204 --> 03:02:10.326
LIAM: Okay.

03:02:10.326 --> 03:02:12.254
(laughter)

03:02:12.254 --> 03:02:13.609
LIAM: Roll to attack.

03:02:13.609 --> 03:02:15.682
ASHLEY: Those are actually pretty strong.

03:02:15.682 --> 03:02:18.060
TRAVIS: Masking tape and 'Ashley' written on it.

03:02:18.060 --> 03:02:22.401
MATT: Well, if it's like the hardcover cast stuff,
then yeah, that could actually be substantial.

03:02:22.401 --> 03:02:24.507
MARISHA: It could be a piece of plywood, it's hard
to say.

03:02:24.507 --> 03:02:26.628
ASHLEY: Do I get advantage because it's mine?

03:02:26.628 --> 03:02:31.519
LIAM: No, but you can add your proficiency bonus
'cause you're a rogue, and it's a dagger, and

03:02:31.519 --> 03:02:34.664
your-- I'm gonna say strength here.

03:02:34.664 --> 03:02:36.177
ASHLEY: So I would add both of those?

03:02:36.177 --> 03:02:37.479
LIAM and MATT: Yes.

03:02:37.479 --> 03:02:39.960
ASHLEY: 12.

03:02:39.960 --> 03:02:53.469
LIAM: Oh, girl. It's rubber. It just bends to the
side as soon as you stab it down. Matt? Oh yeah,

03:02:53.469 --> 03:02:57.228
do you wanna do anything else, do you wanna pull
away?

03:02:57.228 --> 03:03:06.624
ASHLEY: I mean, I'm just gonna ask-- yeah, 'cause
I can't attack again, obviously. I'm gonna ask the

03:03:06.624 --> 03:03:11.501
big thing, talk to me, what do you want?

03:03:11.501 --> 03:03:17.528
LIAM: On that broken piece of screen down the
side, you see the lower half, you can make it out,

03:03:17.528 --> 03:03:24.579
it's fragmented but you can see most of the word
'FORGIVE M--' And it's gone.

03:03:24.579 --> 03:03:28.449
MARISHA: Okay, so I got a 'NO', you got--

03:03:28.449 --> 03:03:29.587
SAM: 'SAM'.

03:03:29.587 --> 03:03:32.202
MARISHA: 'SAM'. And then he said 'FORGIVE'.

03:03:32.202 --> 03:03:33.376
SAM: 'FORGIVE M--'

03:03:33.376 --> 03:03:34.556
MARISHA: 'FORGIVE M--'

03:03:34.556 --> 03:03:36.027
SAM: For killing people.

03:03:36.027 --> 03:03:38.308
ASHLEY: 'FORGIVE M--' or 'FORGIVENESS'?

03:03:38.308 --> 03:03:41.100
MARISHA: I got a 'NO', he got a 'SAM', you got a
'FORGIVE M--'

03:03:41.100 --> 03:03:42.869
LIAM: What would you like to do, Matt?

03:03:42.869 --> 03:03:44.905
MATT: Well, I used all my spells in the previous
battles.

03:03:44.905 --> 03:03:49.227
LIAM: Before this performance-capture stage?

03:03:49.227 --> 03:03:50.451
MATT: Yeah.

03:03:50.451 --> 03:03:52.954
LIAM: You still feel-- you feel magical.

03:03:52.954 --> 03:03:55.056
SAM: Does everything reset?

03:03:55.056 --> 03:04:01.958
MATT: Okay, well, that changes things. Well,
first, I'm gonna go ahead and say, it's all right,

03:04:01.958 --> 03:04:06.327
Ashley, you've spent a lot of time in this volume
before, you're still the queen of it. So I'll give

03:04:06.391 --> 03:04:08.050
you a Healing Word with my bonus action.

03:04:08.050 --> 03:04:09.487
ASHLEY: Hey!

03:04:09.487 --> 03:04:12.203
MATT: And that's a five, you heal five.

03:04:12.203 --> 03:04:17.288
ASHLEY: Yay! Thanks, Matt. So clutch.

03:04:17.288 --> 03:04:29.445
MATT: And I'm gonna go ahead... so the leg that
broke off? I'm gonna go ahead and rush over to

03:04:29.445 --> 03:04:35.976
pick it up, and like a giant metal baseball bat,
swing back and try and hit back at it

03:04:35.976 --> 03:04:37.284
with its own leg.

03:04:37.284 --> 03:04:39.145
LIAM: Yeah, you are. Go for it.

03:04:39.145 --> 03:04:43.780
MATT: So it's like (yells). Not very good with it.
Is this at disadvantage?

03:04:43.780 --> 03:04:45.939
LIAM: At disadvantage?

03:04:45.939 --> 03:04:48.087
MATT: I'm not proficient--

03:04:48.087 --> 03:04:49.871
LIAM: Nah. You're-- nah.

03:04:49.871 --> 03:04:54.909
MATT: All right, so we'll say-- that's a 19?
Natural.

03:04:54.909 --> 03:04:55.876
LIAM: Yeah, man.

03:04:55.876 --> 03:04:57.792
MATT: Two for strength.

03:04:57.792 --> 03:05:01.233
LIAM: Two for strength. Yeah. Absolutely hits.
Clocked that motherfucker. Roll a d4.

03:05:01.287 --> 03:05:05.927
MATT: That is a two plus two. Four damage.

03:05:05.927 --> 03:05:10.795
LIAM: Okay. You break off-- you were trying to
break off a leg, you said?

03:05:10.795 --> 03:05:12.492
MATT: Trying to hit one of the other legs, yeah.

03:05:12.492 --> 03:05:16.011
LIAM: Yeah. It breaks. It smashes, and the thing
lurches down to the side.

03:05:16.011 --> 03:05:19.494
MATT: Yeah, I'm not going for the core, I'm just
going for its means of attack.

03:05:19.494 --> 03:05:24.015
LIAM: Right, right, right. And it falls right in
front of you, and now the little camcorder-sized

03:05:24.015 --> 03:05:27.465
screen falls right in front of your face, and you
see 'FORGIVE ME'. Gone.

03:05:27.465 --> 03:05:29.200
MARISHA: What?

03:05:29.200 --> 03:05:31.900
LIAM: Marisha, what would you like to do--

03:05:31.900 --> 03:05:37.660
MATT: At the end of my turn, I shout, just 'cause
I'm really curious, let's not kill it yet, but

03:05:37.660 --> 03:05:39.431
definitely disable it!

03:05:39.431 --> 03:05:42.619
SAM: Noted.

03:05:42.619 --> 03:05:44.516
LIAM: Marisha is up.

03:05:44.516 --> 03:06:01.641
MARISHA: I look at Matt, and I say, don't kill it?
'Kay. And then I look for its memory card. It's

03:06:01.641 --> 03:06:04.879
gotta have-- I'm thinking my production elements.

03:06:04.879 --> 03:06:06.689
LIAM: Right, right, logic, I like it.

03:06:06.689 --> 03:06:14.204
MARISHA: Yeah. It's gotta have a memory card
somewhere in there. How many gigs does it have?

03:06:14.204 --> 03:06:18.522
It's hard to say. But if I immediately remove it.

03:06:18.590 --> 03:06:25.801
LIAM: All right. Make an investigation check to
find its memory card.

03:06:25.801 --> 03:06:33.100
MARISHA: Jesus fucking christ, all right. Oh my
god, that's a natural 20.

03:06:33.100 --> 03:06:36.688
MATT: On the Snitch? Well, on your Snitch.

03:06:36.688 --> 03:06:38.483
MARISHA: See? Look at it.

03:06:38.483 --> 03:06:39.969
MATT: Yeah, that's an actual natural 20.

03:06:39.969 --> 03:06:41.436
MARISHA: It's a natural 20.

03:06:41.436 --> 03:06:50.268
LIAM: Okay. You see on the bottom of it, like a
fucking outie belly button, a cylinder, and on the

03:06:50.268 --> 03:06:53.468
end of the cylinder's a slot, and it says right
above it, 'SD'.

03:06:53.468 --> 03:07:01.240
MARISHA: Like output? Is it output? And I'm just
gonna go click. And see if it pulls out.

03:07:01.240 --> 03:07:06.540
LIAM: It doesn't... it doesn't.

03:07:06.540 --> 03:07:09.388
MARISHA: No? No pulling out of the SD card?

03:07:09.388 --> 03:07:16.649
LIAM: No, you press it and-- I mean, it's going
(whirring sound) while you're doing this, you

03:07:16.649 --> 03:07:18.556
definitely found something.

03:07:18.556 --> 03:07:24.287
MARISHA: It's not connected to the cloud! They
don't have a backup drive!

03:07:24.287 --> 03:07:29.743
LIAM: But pressing in does not then detach an SD
card and give you photographs or

03:07:29.743 --> 03:07:31.103
shut the thing down.

03:07:31.103 --> 03:07:33.111
(laughter)

03:07:33.111 --> 03:07:34.999
MARISHA: I'm just wondering if the memory card--

03:07:34.999 --> 03:07:39.820
LIAM: But you did spend six seconds finding that
thing. And--

03:07:39.820 --> 03:07:45.554
MARISHA: It does have a backup drive. It does not
matter, though. That's the important part, is that

03:07:45.554 --> 03:07:48.091
no one cares that we have a backup.

03:07:48.091 --> 03:07:52.336
LIAM: In a split-second, in your peripheral
vision, you see a light blink, but it's gone. You

03:07:52.336 --> 03:07:54.885
didn't see what it said.

03:07:54.885 --> 03:07:59.980
MARISHA: These people have very poor cloud
storage. That's all you need to know.

03:07:59.980 --> 03:08:09.242
LIAM: Laura tries to get in front of Neil, and she
starts pulling on wires coming out of the thing's

03:08:09.242 --> 03:08:13.920
head, and she yanks, but she's pulling, and it's
not doing anything. She's really little. Really

03:08:13.920 --> 03:08:19.255
cute. She's so small, and the wires are not coming
free, but she's trying, she's trying to save Neil

03:08:19.255 --> 03:08:23.060
Druckmann. Sam, what do you want to do?

03:08:23.060 --> 03:08:32.625
SAM: Me? I mean, I don't really know what these
symbols and messages mean, so like the piece of

03:08:32.625 --> 03:08:41.321
scaffolding that fell down like this, can I run
and sort of jump on it and do it again?

03:08:41.321 --> 03:08:47.765
LIAM: Make an acrobatics check.

03:08:47.765 --> 03:08:51.156
SAM: Okay. Four. (laughs)

03:08:51.156 --> 03:08:59.038
LIAM: You run at this thing and you jump, and you
crush your nuts so hard on the side of this thing.

03:08:59.038 --> 03:09:07.135
You just hit it and you slide down to the bottom
of it, and wish that you hadn't decided to do what

03:09:07.135 --> 03:09:08.564
you just did.

03:09:08.564 --> 03:09:14.174
SAM: And then I'll spend the rest of my
action/bonus or whatever looking at those screens

03:09:14.174 --> 03:09:16.516
to see if they say anything to me.

03:09:16.516 --> 03:09:18.174
LIAM: Yeah, it does, briefly.

03:09:18.174 --> 03:09:19.418
SAM: What?

03:09:19.418 --> 03:09:20.552
LIAM: 'HUSBAND'.

03:09:20.552 --> 03:09:21.719
SAM: 'HUSBAND'?

03:09:21.719 --> 03:09:25.280
LIAM: Taliesin, you're up.

03:09:25.280 --> 03:09:30.218
SAM: (whispers) It's Liam. It's Liam.

03:09:30.218 --> 03:09:34.130
MARISHA: They're not filming in 4K, it's fine,
just go.

03:09:34.130 --> 03:09:40.888
TALIESIN: Without breaking eye contact with
Marisha, I send another tendril at the one that

03:09:40.888 --> 03:09:42.526
won't stay down.

03:09:42.526 --> 03:09:47.338
LIAM: This guy right here, right? This is the one.
Sure. Ranged attack. The prince of--

03:09:47.338 --> 03:09:50.756
TALIESIN: 11.

03:09:50.756 --> 03:09:59.984
LIAM: The tentacle does a great big display and
spirals around, and you look fucking fierce and it

03:09:59.984 --> 03:10:03.679
matches the color of your hair. No it doesn't. No
it doesn't!

03:10:03.679 --> 03:10:05.651
TALIESIN: It doesn't match the color of my hair.

03:10:05.651 --> 03:10:11.263
LIAM: It matches the color of your in-person hair
right now. There we go. But it doesn't reach. It

03:10:11.263 --> 03:10:16.081
falls short. We see a lot of rage and fury, but no
delivery.

03:10:16.081 --> 03:10:23.059
TALIESIN: All right. And I'm going to back off a
bit, and I'm gonna also keep looking at those

03:10:23.059 --> 03:10:25.543
screens to see if they say anything.

03:10:25.543 --> 03:10:32.121
LIAM: No? No. Not right now. Not in that
split-second. Travis.

03:10:32.121 --> 03:10:41.138
TRAVIS: Can I reach up to my mocap helmet and
wrench the little GoPro camera that's surrounded

03:10:41.138 --> 03:10:42.543
by LED lights.

03:10:42.543 --> 03:10:44.568
LIAM: Yes you can!

03:10:44.568 --> 03:10:48.850
TRAVIS: Can I wrench it off and can I face it
towards it, go, backfeed!

03:10:48.850 --> 03:10:52.346
LIAM: You're using it like a talisman?

03:10:52.508 --> 03:10:54.696
TRAVIS: Yeah, you know, like little fucking
Hobbits, like you know,

03:10:54.696 --> 03:10:56.795
little Bilbo did, using the--

03:10:56.795 --> 03:10:59.007
MATT: The LED light that's always in our face.

03:10:59.007 --> 03:11:04.792
LIAM: I'll tell you what, I will not give you
advantage, but I will give you a DM inspiration

03:11:04.792 --> 03:11:07.834
die of a d6 to make an intimidation check.

03:11:07.834 --> 03:11:11.892
TRAVIS: Yes! Okay. Ooh!

03:11:11.892 --> 03:11:14.898
TALIESIN: Plus a d6.

03:11:14.898 --> 03:11:16.340
TRAVIS: 27.

03:11:16.340 --> 03:11:17.546
TALIESIN: Plus a d6.

03:11:17.546 --> 03:11:18.776
LIAM: 27?

03:11:18.776 --> 03:11:27.219
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry, sorry. 21. Oh, I won't spend it
now. 21. 19 plus two.

03:11:27.219 --> 03:11:32.592
LIAM: The thing lurches backwards for a bit, and
as it backs away from you, pulling away from that

03:11:32.592 --> 03:11:37.806
metal, you see on the screen it says, 'TRAVIS,
NO'. And that disappears and it backs away,

03:11:37.806 --> 03:11:44.679
pulling, dragging cords out of that hole. It can't
really get too far, because it's now you see that

03:11:44.679 --> 03:11:49.375
it is connected down, it was sort of squatting,
hiding a lot of that shit because of the carnage

03:11:49.375 --> 03:11:55.950
underneath it, but it is sort of tethered, not too
much. Do you wanna move, or are you good to go?

03:11:55.950 --> 03:12:04.790
TRAVIS: It's Colla. Colla's in the machine. Oh,
no. Are we bolting for Crafty?

03:12:04.790 --> 03:12:07.213
(laughter)

03:12:07.213 --> 03:12:09.144
SAM: We're gonna get potato chips during this?

03:12:09.144 --> 03:12:11.556
MARISHA: It depends. What did they have on
Crafty?

03:12:11.556 --> 03:12:13.925
TRAVIS: They got ginger beer and all sorts of
shit.

03:12:13.925 --> 03:12:15.575
MARISHA: Do they have trail mix?

03:12:15.575 --> 03:12:17.961
TALIESIN: They're always out of health potions by
the time I get there.

03:12:17.961 --> 03:12:21.065
TRAVIS: I am going to head for the door.

03:12:21.065 --> 03:12:22.835
LIAM: Which one?

03:12:22.835 --> 03:12:25.200
TRAVIS: The green one, down at the-- yeah. That
thing.

03:12:25.200 --> 03:12:26.340
LIAM: Okay.

03:12:26.340 --> 03:12:28.446
TRAVIS: As far as I can go.

03:12:28.446 --> 03:12:33.273
LIAM: 25, 30. All right, that's as far as you can
go because you used your action to do what you

03:12:33.273 --> 03:12:35.789
did. It was amazing. (laughs)

03:12:35.789 --> 03:12:38.156
MATT: Fill out your 1089 before you go.

03:12:38.156 --> 03:12:39.322
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:12:39.322 --> 03:12:46.399
LIAM: This mass of computer screens and keyboards
and other shit that you can't identify comes down

03:12:46.399 --> 03:12:54.517
the ramp. Okay, that's as far as it gets--
actually, no, and it's right there, but it can't do

03:12:54.733 --> 03:13:07.819
anything 'cause it spent its time getting there.
This thing just goes (clattering) but it is done.

03:13:07.819 --> 03:13:11.161
This thing continues to batter Ashley.

03:13:11.161 --> 03:13:12.666
ASHLEY: Isn't it my turn?

03:13:12.666 --> 03:13:23.078
LIAM: No. Not yet. Oh. This thing tries to stick--
it pulls out the pole from inside your gut, and

03:13:23.078 --> 03:13:27.880
you feel a little (fft) as it does so. It tries to go
in again, but you're ready for it, you know it's

03:13:27.935 --> 03:13:39.253
right behind you, and you manage to swivel and
step out of the way. It misses. And big guy snaps

03:13:39.253 --> 03:13:47.376
away and moves back in this direction and Marisha,
you're the only one who sees it,

03:13:47.376 --> 03:13:48.529
but a screen says--

03:13:48.529 --> 03:13:50.369
SAM: Don't I get an attack of opportunity?

03:13:50.369 --> 03:13:51.674
LIAM: Yes, you do.

03:13:51.674 --> 03:13:54.144
SAM: Yes. I'm gonna just try to kick it.

03:13:54.144 --> 03:13:58.261
MATT: 'Cause when it moved back, it was not in
melee range--

03:13:58.261 --> 03:14:05.260
LIAM: But he was on the beam that swung down into
it, and I'm gonna pretend like it

03:14:05.260 --> 03:14:06.710
dragged along with.

03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:08.269
MATT: I like it. Cool.

03:14:08.269 --> 03:14:09.654
LIAM: Hey, we're making it all up as we go.

03:14:09.654 --> 03:14:11.360
SAM: 11 plus something.

03:14:11.360 --> 03:14:16.998
LIAM: 11 plus something? What's your strength
modifier, it's on the left? One? Yeah, you're too

03:14:16.998 --> 03:14:25.004
busy going (yells)-- jeez, sorry everybody. You're
moving in space on that piece of scaffolding, and

03:14:25.004 --> 03:14:31.040
it just fucks up your aim. You don't do it.
Taliesin, devil-child, you're up.

03:14:31.040 --> 03:14:34.701
TALIESIN: No, that was a--

03:14:34.701 --> 03:14:37.875
LIAM: Oh, that was its-- that's right. Ashley's
up.

03:14:37.875 --> 03:14:43.794
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to--

03:14:43.794 --> 03:14:47.577
MARISHA: You know you better than anyone.

03:14:47.577 --> 03:14:56.953
ASHLEY: The 'HUSBAND' threw me off. I am going to
move further that way to get away from these two

03:14:56.953 --> 03:14:58.389
that are there.

03:14:58.389 --> 03:15:00.338
LIAM: You're going this way?

03:15:00.338 --> 03:15:04.408
ASHLEY: Well, maybe just like out of range of
them, touching range. So maybe just like--

03:15:04.408 --> 03:15:06.124
LIAM: But which direction? This direction?

03:15:06.124 --> 03:15:07.279
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:15:07.279 --> 03:15:08.329
LIAM: You're stepping this way?

03:15:08.329 --> 03:15:09.607
ASHLEY: Towards the lounge.

03:15:09.607 --> 03:15:13.750
LIAM: Towards the lounge. As you do so, the thing
takes a swipe at you. What's your AC?

03:15:13.750 --> 03:15:15.102
ASHLEY: 12.

03:15:15.102 --> 03:15:17.059
LIAM: 12? Yep.

03:15:17.059 --> 03:15:22.703
MATT: Velcro bodysuits don't offer a lot of armor
class protection.

03:15:22.703 --> 03:15:27.763
LIAM: On a hinge, a pole just goes (whirring
sound) and you feel it slice the back of your neck

03:15:27.763 --> 03:15:30.371
as you go, and it takes four hit points--

03:15:30.371 --> 03:15:32.071
ASHLEY: Even with the helmet on?

03:15:32.071 --> 03:15:38.350
LIAM: Yeah. It didn't hit the helmet, it hit the
neck. And you feel blood pouring down the back of

03:15:38.350 --> 03:15:43.136
this mocap suit, pooling up around your waist. You
do get away from it. Did you want to go further

03:15:43.136 --> 03:15:44.422
than that, or there?

03:15:44.422 --> 03:15:46.811
ASHLEY: Yeah. I wanna go further in, towards the
lounge.

03:15:46.811 --> 03:15:48.061
LIAM: Okay, so.

03:15:48.061 --> 03:15:52.000
ASHLEY: But I wanna get in eyeshot of the big
computer dude.

03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:53.469
LIAM: This guy?

03:15:53.469 --> 03:16:01.411
ASHLEY: Actually, I'm so sorry. I want to go
further in towards the bigger guy. But kinda walk

03:16:01.411 --> 03:16:03.787
around so I don't get attacked by the other one.

03:16:03.787 --> 03:16:10.816
LIAM: This is also a huge gap, so you could go--
you could get to there. Ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

03:16:10.816 --> 03:16:15.215
That's as far as you can get unless you keep
going, make a dash.

03:16:15.215 --> 03:16:17.299
ASHLEY: I'll dash.

03:16:17.299 --> 03:16:19.208
LIAM: Okay, you want to get right up to it?

03:16:19.208 --> 03:16:20.316
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:16:20.316 --> 03:16:25.107
LIAM: All right, you're out of stuff, though.
You're right in the face of this thing, and the

03:16:25.107 --> 03:16:29.036
screen briefly says 'ASH-O-LEE'. And then it's
gone.

03:16:29.036 --> 03:16:38.490
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I just put down my mocap knife
on the ground?

03:16:38.490 --> 03:16:39.868
LIAM: Yeah, you drop it.

03:16:39.868 --> 03:16:49.237
ASHLEY: And say, I think you've created or done
something that's gotten out of hand,

03:16:49.237 --> 03:16:56.430
and I forgive you.

03:16:56.430 --> 03:16:58.491
LIAM: And now it's Matt's turn.

03:16:58.491 --> 03:17:08.009
MATT: Okay. Is that me right next to the-- right
there, okay. If I can take two steps to get right

03:17:08.009 --> 03:17:13.917
up to the edge of where it emerged from the floor,
and glance inside, what do I see below?

03:17:13.917 --> 03:17:24.612
LIAM: You see a crack going down about eight feet,
and it is like five and a half, six feet wide at

03:17:24.612 --> 03:17:32.520
the most. And you see lots of cables. It looks
like black spaghetti. And it's all cabled, but

03:17:32.520 --> 03:17:38.809
again, it's wet and oily. If you jumped down into
that, you would be disgusting.

03:17:38.809 --> 03:17:39.851
MATT: Yeah.

03:17:39.851 --> 03:17:42.292
SAM: Everything's wet in Liam's world.

03:17:42.292 --> 03:17:43.959
LIAM: Yes, husband.

03:17:43.959 --> 03:17:56.631
MATT: I'm going to, if I can, move along-- move
from your perspective this way two more squares,

03:17:56.631 --> 03:17:59.983
and then jump across that little bit of the gap
that's there.

03:17:59.983 --> 03:18:02.907
LIAM: Sure, you can make it, you can go one more
square.

03:18:02.907 --> 03:18:04.328
MATT: No, right there's where I wanna stand.

03:18:04.328 --> 03:18:05.434
LIAM: All right, great.

03:18:05.434 --> 03:18:09.447
MATT: And I'm gonna go ahead and use Thunderwave
in front of me to try and blast them back and do

03:18:09.447 --> 03:18:16.349
damage. As I rush forward, I jump across the way
and go (hesitant noises). And I realize that we

03:18:16.349 --> 03:18:23.575
probably have a PA system set up, and I grab the
microphone on the edge of the head thing and just

03:18:23.575 --> 03:18:30.498
go (screams) as loud as I can into the microphone.
Thinking that they probably have a feedback set up

03:18:30.498 --> 03:18:31.943
in the cameras.

03:18:31.943 --> 03:18:33.379
LIAM: Okay. Okay.

03:18:33.379 --> 03:18:35.741
MATT: So that's a constitution saving throw for
both of them.

03:18:35.741 --> 03:18:40.014
LIAM: Okay. And the DC is?

03:18:40.014 --> 03:18:41.754
MATT: 13.

03:18:41.754 --> 03:18:45.325
LIAM: They do make it.

03:18:45.325 --> 03:18:57.132
MATT: Okay. So that would be ten points of thunder
damage, or half on a successful save, so they're

03:18:57.132 --> 03:19:00.768
not pushed, but they take five points of thunder
damage each.

03:19:00.768 --> 03:19:09.897
LIAM: Okay. This thing-- just out of the pureness
of Matthew Mercer's heart and soul, which we all

03:19:09.897 --> 03:19:19.519
see, let's be honest, in a moment of crisis, your
heart and care for your friends bursts out of the

03:19:19.519 --> 03:19:25.961
microphone system, we hear it everywhere,
distorted, but certainly a blast of fucking force

03:19:25.961 --> 03:19:32.288
out of your fucking chest, Matt, goes (explosion)
and this thing just goes (explosion) and pieces go

03:19:32.288 --> 03:19:33.823
(clattering) and fall down.

03:19:33.823 --> 03:19:35.332
(cheering)

03:19:35.332 --> 03:19:42.243
LIAM: This thing, you smashed-- three iMac screens
get smashed and cracked and break away, and this

03:19:42.243 --> 03:19:45.110
thing looks very haggard, but it is still there.

03:19:45.110 --> 03:19:51.832
MATT: I'll use my last five feet of movement to
try and then move alongside of the crack away from

03:19:51.832 --> 03:19:54.161
the currently still standing there creature.

03:19:54.161 --> 03:19:55.092
LIAM: This way?

03:19:55.092 --> 03:20:02.392
MATT: Yeah, that is a crack, so I'd say just one
away from the crack.

03:20:02.392 --> 03:20:07.596
LIAM: You step backward and this is not too deep,
but you are now standing in-- you're not caught or

03:20:07.596 --> 03:20:11.845
anything, but you're now standing in the really
slippery shit. It's also really adorable to see

03:20:11.845 --> 03:20:19.859
you two hugging at the table right now. And
Marisha-- oh, you know what? I missed Neil before

03:20:19.859 --> 03:20:28.066
because I'm just-- he's a d6 in my list, so I'm
gonna let Neil jump up and attack this thing.

03:20:28.066 --> 03:20:29.878
ASHLEY: C'mon, Neil!

03:20:29.878 --> 03:20:31.900
MATT: You got this.

03:20:31.900 --> 03:20:33.067
LIAM: Yeah.

03:20:33.067 --> 03:20:36.963
TRAVIS: (sings) He whipped his hair back and
forth, he whipped his hair back and forth.

03:20:36.963 --> 03:20:53.950
LIAM: Okay, so that is-- okay. He grabs a hold of
it and rips a screen off. (yells) (whirring

03:20:53.950 --> 03:21:01.640
sounds) "Fuck. Laura?" And it is Marisha's turn.

03:21:01.640 --> 03:21:04.662
MARISHA: Wait, was that (whirring sounds) Neil?

03:21:04.662 --> 03:21:09.403
LIAM: No, it turned to Neil. What was left 
of it turned toward Neil.

03:21:09.456 --> 03:21:16.730
MARISHA: Okay. And there's still that thing that's
digging in the corner. Can I get to it?

03:21:16.730 --> 03:21:17.918
Where am I?

03:21:17.918 --> 03:21:21.922
LIAM: You're here. You can, you'd run out of juice
by the time you got there. You'd have to dash to

03:21:21.922 --> 03:21:26.591
get there. You can get to that one.

03:21:26.591 --> 03:21:29.866
MATT: Your movement's 30?

03:21:29.866 --> 03:21:31.913
MARISHA: Wait, what's that thing?

03:21:31.913 --> 03:21:35.262
LIAM: This? Matt just fucked it up with a
Thunderwave.

03:21:35.262 --> 03:21:37.037
MARISHA: Okay, I get to that.

03:21:37.037 --> 03:21:39.495
LIAM: All right, you're right up on it.

03:21:39.495 --> 03:21:53.831
MARISHA: And can I take it by the back of its neck
and push it and be like, scream real loud! We need

03:21:53.831 --> 03:21:57.599
the feedback! (yells)

03:21:57.599 --> 03:22:00.767
LIAM: And do anything or yell at it?

03:22:00.767 --> 03:22:03.175
MARISHA: And grab it by the back of its neck.

03:22:03.175 --> 03:22:08.692
LIAM: You mean, the brace holding the iMac's
screen up? Okay.

03:22:08.692 --> 03:22:12.316
MARISHA: And I go, scream! Scream for me!

03:22:12.316 --> 03:22:14.343
LIAM: Okay. And that's it?

03:22:14.343 --> 03:22:15.434
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:22:15.434 --> 03:22:17.079
TRAVIS: It's like Phantom of the Opera.

03:22:17.079 --> 03:22:19.501
MARISHA: Sing! Sing!

03:22:19.501 --> 03:22:22.694
LIAM: Make an intimidation check?

03:22:22.694 --> 03:22:30.110
MARISHA: Sure. Oh, that's not good. Seven.

03:22:30.110 --> 03:22:36.795
LIAM: There's a crackle of light, and then it
makes that sound when Macs reboot and goes

03:22:36.795 --> 03:22:38.398
(bwomp).

03:22:38.398 --> 03:22:40.696
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Damn it, Macs.

03:22:40.696 --> 03:22:49.460
LIAM: That's about it. Laura tries to punch the--
sorry, Laura's not feeling too well. Laura attacks

03:22:49.460 --> 03:22:57.048
this thing, going, "Neil, come on! Together! Oh my
goodness!" And she tries to punch at it. She hits

03:22:57.048 --> 03:23:02.939
it right in the one solid piece left on this thing
and kinda hits her hand really hard. She stays

03:23:02.939 --> 03:23:06.735
there, though. She's afraid to leave Neil.

03:23:06.735 --> 03:23:08.933
ASHLEY: 'Cause she's a good friend.

03:23:08.933 --> 03:23:11.151
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sam, your turn.

03:23:11.151 --> 03:23:14.381
SAM: I'm gonna run as fast as I can up to the big
guy.

03:23:14.381 --> 03:23:15.782
LIAM: Yes. This one?

03:23:15.782 --> 03:23:16.845
SAM: Yeah.

03:23:16.845 --> 03:23:19.079
LIAM: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

03:23:19.079 --> 03:23:20.404
SAM: Even closer--

03:23:20.404 --> 03:23:21.536
LIAM: You're gonna run out of--

03:23:21.536 --> 03:23:23.082
SAM: That's okay. I just want to talk to it.

03:23:23.082 --> 03:23:24.112
LIAM: Okay, go.

03:23:24.112 --> 03:23:31.082
SAM: And I just want to say to it, Liam! If you
can hear me in there, hey buddy. Let's knock this

03:23:31.082 --> 03:23:38.394
off and just record our podcast, okay? We haven't
done an episode in like three months. We should

03:23:38.394 --> 03:23:43.676
just do one of those instead! We got recording
equipment right here, huh? What do you say, pal?

03:23:43.676 --> 03:23:47.082
LIAM: Eight feet above you is that little
camcorder screen, and you're eyeing it, you've

03:23:47.082 --> 03:23:49.907
learned by now, and it just says 'FIND ME'.

03:23:49.907 --> 03:23:54.083
SAM: 'FIND ME'. That means find Liam. We have to
find Liam.

03:23:54.083 --> 03:23:55.763
MARISHA: Okay.

03:23:55.763 --> 03:23:57.840
MATT: Didn't Liam just get--

03:23:57.840 --> 03:24:00.691
SAM: We just heard a scream, we didn't see him
die.

03:24:00.691 --> 03:24:02.462
LIAM: Taliesin.

03:24:02.462 --> 03:24:09.253
TALIESIN: There is so much that is unpleasant
happening in here. I'm gonna free up some people.

03:24:09.253 --> 03:24:14.807
There's just too much happening. The one that
Laura's-- yeah, I'm right there.

03:24:14.807 --> 03:24:16.547
LIAM: He's right on your butt.

03:24:16.547 --> 03:24:18.166
TALIESIN: (sighs)

03:24:18.166 --> 03:24:22.885
LIAM: And he's just come from mangling sweet Liam
O'Brien.

03:24:22.885 --> 03:24:29.559
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. Travis is gonna keep him
busy for a second. I'm gonna deal with the one

03:24:29.559 --> 03:24:34.113
that Laura is-- I'm gonna keep rolling around,
just trying to-- I'm gonna run away from that one

03:24:34.113 --> 03:24:37.455
and try and stab the one up by-- yeah, that one
over there.

03:24:37.455 --> 03:24:39.723
TRAVIS: I'm going to Crafty. Nature Valley granola
bars.

03:24:39.723 --> 03:24:43.158
LIAM: So you're going after this one? You're
attacking from where you are, or you're moving?

03:24:43.158 --> 03:24:48.021
TALIESIN: Both. I'm not getting within-- I'm
getting further from that-- oh, am I up face-up to

03:24:48.021 --> 03:24:50.278
that one? Oh, I didn't know I was face-up to that
one.

03:24:50.278 --> 03:24:51.424
LIAM: Okay, understood.

03:24:51.424 --> 03:24:58.032
TALIESIN: I thought I was the guy below. Yeah. I'm
gonna shove tentacles in it and hopefully start to

03:24:58.032 --> 03:24:59.000
wrangle it apart.

03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:01.681
LIAM: Okay. Ranged attack.

03:25:01.681 --> 03:25:03.610
TRAVIS: Grab the last one of them fruit snacks.

03:25:03.610 --> 03:25:05.457
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's not good. Nine.

03:25:05.457 --> 03:25:11.919
LIAM: Yeah, no. It actually, the tentacles fizzle.
They're not there. You see a brief glow and it

03:25:11.919 --> 03:25:15.196
goes (gurgling) and they sort of curl and shrivel
in on themselves.

03:25:15.196 --> 03:25:19.517
TALIESIN: Travis! Help!

03:25:19.517 --> 03:25:22.635
LIAM: Travis, what do you wanna do?

03:25:22.635 --> 03:25:25.375
TRAVIS: I'm double-dashing for Crafty.

03:25:25.375 --> 03:25:28.612
TALIESIN: No! I'll remember this!

03:25:28.612 --> 03:25:31.081
LIAM: Your wife is right here.

03:25:31.081 --> 03:25:33.857
TRAVIS: Nope. This is all a bad dream.

03:25:33.857 --> 03:25:34.982
LIAM: Are you going?

03:25:34.982 --> 03:25:36.121
TRAVIS: I'm going.

03:25:36.121 --> 03:25:39.933
LIAM: Wow. Travis ran into the pale green light
spilling out of a hole in the wall.

03:25:39.933 --> 03:25:44.054
TRAVIS: It's green! This is going terrible.

03:25:44.054 --> 03:25:45.695
ASHLEY: Travis!

03:25:45.695 --> 03:25:48.727
MARISHA: There are wasabi peas there, go, go, go!

03:25:48.727 --> 03:25:51.802
TRAVIS: There's a kale smoothie.

03:25:51.802 --> 03:25:54.080
ASHLEY: I can't believe you.

03:25:54.080 --> 03:25:58.687
MATT: That's what it was. When you said, "Travis!
Help!" you were straight-up Neo. "Trinity! Help!"

03:25:58.687 --> 03:26:05.431
LIAM: Sam, this thing leans in on you, and as it
comes down closer to you, you see, 'SAD'. Gone.

03:26:05.431 --> 03:26:10.314
And it stabs one of its remaining three legs, just
sort of jukes up on its side 'cause it has three

03:26:10.314 --> 03:26:15.254
legs, so suddenly it has two legs, it's rickety,
it tries to stab downward at you, but because it's

03:26:15.254 --> 03:26:20.883
now teetering on two legs, (Dr. Moreau voice) 'to
walk on two legs is hard, maybe four is better'.

03:26:20.883 --> 03:26:23.074
(laughter)

03:26:23.074 --> 03:26:33.754
LIAM: Its aim is bad, and it stabs into the
ground. This thing swivels-- this thing is

03:26:33.754 --> 03:26:39.243
short-circuiting and bristling, sparks are flying
off of it, but it rears up like a horse almost,

03:26:39.243 --> 03:26:47.661
and the legs come down, and you guys watch as two
sharpened tripod legs go through Neil Druckmann's

03:26:47.661 --> 03:26:53.617
guts on the ground, and Neil gets pushed to the
ground and starts screaming, and he goes

03:26:53.617 --> 03:27:01.006
(screams), and he reaches up and grabs hold of the
cables on it, and as blood is going (spraying

03:27:01.006 --> 03:27:11.207
sound), he rips as hard as he can, and cables
break free, and the machine just falls, broken, on

03:27:11.207 --> 03:27:15.431
top of Neil, and nothing moves there, neither
move.

03:27:15.431 --> 03:27:19.535
MARISHA: But did he sign his NDA? Oh no.

03:27:19.592 --> 03:27:22.086
SAM: He had so many more games to make.

03:27:22.086 --> 03:27:24.092
MATT: The great NDA in the sky.

03:27:24.092 --> 03:27:26.500
TALIESIN: He'll never break NDA again.

03:27:26.500 --> 03:27:35.312
LIAM: This thing takes two iMac-- it's got iMac
palms, and it just goes (creaking sound) and does

03:27:35.312 --> 03:27:40.808
smack you in your head, but oddly, it doesn't
really hurt. I mean, it hurts, but you've had

03:27:40.808 --> 03:27:53.269
worse knocks. This brand-new baby robot is not so
experienced. And this guy gets up on its little

03:27:53.269 --> 03:27:58.981
pin-pokey legs and tries to scuttle around and
deal with you, and actually, its back leg snaps,

03:27:58.981 --> 03:28:05.466
and it tries to stab out at you, but because these
things are made out of tinkertoys, almost, it

03:28:05.466 --> 03:28:12.183
feels like, it loses its balance and the arm goes
wide, and you feel it go (fwwp), and bad girl, you

03:28:12.183 --> 03:28:17.333
have trained in martial arts, you went-- you pull
to the side just in time, and you feel it catch a

03:28:17.333 --> 03:28:21.702
little bit of your hair. You have a flashback of
your hair being matted on a beach, and that's

03:28:21.752 --> 03:28:24.447
gone. And it is Ashley's turn.

03:28:24.447 --> 03:28:32.999
ASHLEY: Okay. Talk to the big guy again and say,
where do we find you?

03:28:32.999 --> 03:28:37.125
LIAM: Is that all you want to do?

03:28:37.125 --> 03:28:39.403
ASHLEY: No.

03:28:39.403 --> 03:28:41.401
(laughter)

03:28:41.401 --> 03:28:43.117
SAM: Not anymore.

03:28:43.117 --> 03:28:53.649
ASHLEY: I just-- depending on what he says
determines what I'm going to do. Can I do that?

03:28:53.649 --> 03:29:02.283
LIAM: Okay. Five of six seconds go by, and the
screens flash nothing. And in a split-second, you

03:29:02.283 --> 03:29:05.041
decide to...

03:29:05.041 --> 03:29:15.292
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to-- (sighs) Shit. I'm
gonna start running towards

03:29:15.292 --> 03:29:18.005
the fucking green Crafty.

03:29:18.005 --> 03:29:19.614
SAM: No!

03:29:19.614 --> 03:29:21.875
TALIESIN: It's time for Crafty!

03:29:21.875 --> 03:29:24.333
MATT: The draw's too strong for the Crafty room.

03:29:24.333 --> 03:29:26.069
ASHLEY: 'Cause I don't think he's in that thing.

03:29:26.069 --> 03:29:28.386
TRAVIS: There's egg rolls out here!

03:29:28.386 --> 03:29:31.000
MATT: I hope it's like a Resident Evil movie-style
just laser hallway,

03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:32.696
and you just walk through and--

03:29:32.696 --> 03:29:34.298
TRAVIS: I'm in the cubes.

03:29:34.298 --> 03:29:38.436
MATT: Yep. None of us know, we all just one by one
plow through.

03:29:38.436 --> 03:29:46.443
LIAM: As you're running, you hear (whirring
sounds) and you feel the back of your leg, rake

03:29:46.443 --> 03:29:52.251
something down the back leg of your mocap suit,
and the whole back leg rips and tears, but you

03:29:52.251 --> 03:29:57.353
keep running. Five, ten, 15, 20--

03:29:57.353 --> 03:29:59.666
ASHLEY: I want to go around that thing.

03:29:59.666 --> 03:30:00.664
LIAM: This way?

03:30:00.664 --> 03:30:01.761
ASHLEY: No, the other side.

03:30:01.761 --> 03:30:02.583
LIAM: This way.

03:30:02.583 --> 03:30:04.657
ASHLEY: The other side of the chasm.

03:30:04.657 --> 03:30:06.905
LIAM: That's where you are. Matt?

03:30:06.905 --> 03:30:09.569
MATT: How much damage did she take? Did she take
any damage, or is she good?

03:30:09.634 --> 03:30:10.720
LIAM: She got missed.

03:30:10.720 --> 03:30:14.023
MATT: Good. Awesome. All right, seeing all this
going down--

03:30:14.023 --> 03:30:17.096
TRAVIS: Join me in Crafty.

03:30:17.096 --> 03:30:22.551
MARISHA: If we don't get a Welch's sponsorship
after this, I'm going to pursue that shit. Yo,

03:30:22.551 --> 03:30:26.441
Welch's. Keep going.

03:30:26.441 --> 03:30:33.149
MATT: I'm going to-- she's got that one. I'm going
to make 30 feet towards Taliesin while shouting

03:30:33.149 --> 03:30:36.508
out, Liam, are you okay?

03:30:36.508 --> 03:30:38.830
LIAM: You don't hear anything.

03:30:38.830 --> 03:30:45.267
MATT: I'm going to, as I look over at Taliesin
facing off with the creature, I'm like, you're

03:30:45.267 --> 03:30:48.493
adorable, and you've got this. You've adorably got
this!

03:30:48.493 --> 03:30:49.639
SAM: Inspiration.

03:30:49.639 --> 03:30:51.622
MATT: I'm giving you an insipiration die. A d6.

03:30:51.622 --> 03:30:53.786
SAM: You are adorable. Well, you were.

03:30:53.786 --> 03:30:56.819
MATT: And I'm going to dash up towards the ramp in
the back corner,

03:30:56.819 --> 03:30:58.592
just to see what remains of Liam.

03:30:58.592 --> 03:31:01.952
LIAM: And Taliesin's cheeks turn even rosier as
you run off.

03:31:01.952 --> 03:31:05.294
TALIESIN: I was so marketable.

03:31:05.294 --> 03:31:11.885
LIAM: You get up here. It's not good.

03:31:11.885 --> 03:31:22.185
MATT: Okay. Like he has a few minutes left to
live, or no, it's fucking Chef Boyardee. Okay.

03:31:22.185 --> 03:31:23.391
SAM: Who, Liam?

03:31:23.391 --> 03:31:24.321
MATT: Yeah.

03:31:24.321 --> 03:31:25.819
TRAVIS: Well, let's be descriptive, shall we?

03:31:25.819 --> 03:31:27.331
LIAM: You don't even see a face anymore.

03:31:27.331 --> 03:31:30.352
MATT: Okay. All right. Well, that's definitely the
end of my turn.

03:31:30.352 --> 03:31:33.013
LIAM: Marisha?

03:31:33.013 --> 03:31:37.481
MARISHA: Okay, I have this guy? It's just me and
him?

03:31:37.481 --> 03:31:38.497
LIAM: Yes.

03:31:38.497 --> 03:31:44.464
MARISHA: Okay. And he's a robot, too?

03:31:44.464 --> 03:31:53.589
LIAM: It's a robot. It's moving camera equipment
and highly expensive performance-capture

03:31:53.589 --> 03:31:56.312
equipment, repurposed.

03:31:56.419 --> 03:32:06.587
MARISHA: Highly expensive camera equipment,
repurposed. Okay. Can I sweep his leg and go into

03:32:06.587 --> 03:32:17.194
a combat triangle and take him down, and then be
like, where's your failsafe?

03:32:17.194 --> 03:32:20.944
LIAM: Of course you can. This is D&amp;amp;D. Roll to
attack.

03:32:20.944 --> 03:32:23.262
TRAVIS: Of course you can do all of that. Go
offline.

03:32:23.262 --> 03:32:25.923
LIAM: Roll to attack.

03:32:25.923 --> 03:32:27.317
MARISHA: Okay.

03:32:27.317 --> 03:32:30.494
LIAM: Let's deal with the sweep-the-leg part
first.

03:32:30.494 --> 03:32:35.889
MARISHA: Sweep the leg. Don't fuck me, Gil! That's
a natural one, Gil.

03:32:35.889 --> 03:32:37.252
SAM: Oh god.

03:32:37.252 --> 03:32:46.710
LIAM: Your foot traces an arc and goes (impact
noise) and stops and does not move past its leg.

03:32:46.767 --> 03:32:52.939
MARISHA: Can I go: There's a firewall! There's a
fucking firewall!

03:32:52.939 --> 03:32:56.695
LIAM: Do you want to use your second monk attack?

03:32:56.695 --> 03:32:58.280
MARISHA: Do I have another one?

03:32:58.280 --> 03:33:02.995
LIAM: Yeah. Bonus, yeah. Action and bonus. You're
right there. Roll again. You just completed a

03:33:02.995 --> 03:33:04.957
kick. Maybe you can punch it in the goolies.

03:33:04.957 --> 03:33:13.537
MARISHA: I'm going to punch and see if I can grab
its cords and rip it out.

03:33:13.601 --> 03:33:15.792
LIAM: All right. Split-second later, roll to
attack.

03:33:15.792 --> 03:33:21.808
MARISHA: That's cocked. 18.

03:33:21.808 --> 03:33:25.972
LIAM: Yeah, your foot goes (impact noise), gets
stopped. (grunts) In a very Marisha fashion,

03:33:25.972 --> 03:33:31.245
(impact noise, mechanical noises).

03:33:31.245 --> 03:33:32.538
MARISHA: Yes.

03:33:32.538 --> 03:33:34.053
MATT: All righty.

03:33:34.053 --> 03:33:36.014
TALIESIN: Two down.

03:33:36.068 --> 03:33:38.943
MARISHA: (uncertain noises)

03:33:38.943 --> 03:33:52.202
LIAM: It's Laura's turn. Laura collapses by Neil
and starts pushing this thing off Neil and starts

03:33:52.202 --> 03:33:57.957
saying, "Neil! Neil!" and she starts shaking at
him and crying over his body. There's blood in his

03:33:57.957 --> 03:34:04.261
beard and it's really sad. You guys almost don't
have the heart to go on, but you'd better. Sam,

03:34:04.261 --> 03:34:05.968
what do you want to do?

03:34:05.968 --> 03:34:14.815
SAM: He said "find me" but he's dead. I guess I
didn't see what you saw.

03:34:14.815 --> 03:34:16.298
TRAVIS: (whispering) He's at Crafty.

03:34:16.298 --> 03:34:18.444
LIAM: Find me at Crafty.

03:34:18.499 --> 03:34:25.140
SAM: I'm going to kick the robot in the robot
nuts.

03:34:25.140 --> 03:34:29.297
LIAM: Do it. Right in the SD card belly-button
that Marisha's doing?

03:34:29.297 --> 03:34:30.710
SAM: Yeah. 19.

03:34:30.710 --> 03:34:33.573
LIAM: Hit it.

03:34:33.573 --> 03:34:35.249
SAM: With what?

03:34:35.249 --> 03:34:36.766
LIAM: Your fist, at this point.

03:34:36.766 --> 03:34:38.801
SAM: What am I rolling, a d4?

03:34:38.801 --> 03:34:40.728
LIAM: No. What's your strength modifier?

03:34:40.728 --> 03:34:42.312
SAM: One.

03:34:42.312 --> 03:34:47.728
LIAM: One? It takes two hit points of damage. You
punch it right in its belly-button and you watch

03:34:47.728 --> 03:34:53.466
as this thing that Marisha pointed out when she
was down under there, you watch this cylinder go

03:34:53.466 --> 03:34:58.428
(crunch) and get knocked out of place, and the
thing goes (mechanical winding-down noise,

03:34:58.428 --> 03:35:06.785
ratcheting). It keeps going, but you saw shit
happen when you just hit that thing.

03:35:06.785 --> 03:35:15.279
SAM: Okay. For my bonus action, I will say, please
hit it in its glowing naughty bits, please. Oh,

03:35:15.279 --> 03:35:17.690
wait. Everyone's gone to Crafty.

03:35:17.690 --> 03:35:19.347
MATT: Bye, everyone!

03:35:19.347 --> 03:35:20.783
LIAM: Taliesin's up.

03:35:20.783 --> 03:35:26.211
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're too close to clearing this.
I'm going to try and circle around this thing and

03:35:26.211 --> 03:35:27.596
get a better shot at it.

03:35:27.596 --> 03:35:28.772
LIAM: At this guy?

03:35:28.772 --> 03:35:30.035
TALIESIN: The one that's got me stuck here.

03:35:30.035 --> 03:35:31.167
LIAM: Yeah, go for it. Do you want to move?

03:35:31.167 --> 03:35:32.763
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to circle around him.

03:35:32.763 --> 03:35:37.364
LIAM: Okay. Are you going to give it the tentacle
concho?

03:35:37.364 --> 03:35:39.986
TALIESIN: I am going to tentacle kancho.

03:35:40.039 --> 03:35:40.949
LIAM: Kancho.

03:35:40.949 --> 03:35:42.283
TALIESIN: Kancho.

03:35:42.283 --> 03:35:43.508
MATT: Wow.

03:35:43.508 --> 03:35:50.441
TALIESIN: Yeah, we are kancho-ing here. Big purple
concho. I'm going to add. 11!

03:35:50.441 --> 03:35:53.595
SAM: Just awful.

03:35:53.595 --> 03:36:01.326
LIAM: You've been abandoned by whatever dark force
you wooed into bed, Taliesin. You are not turning

03:36:01.326 --> 03:36:03.278
it on right now.

03:36:03.278 --> 03:36:05.647
TALIESIN: It's because Matt's sitting in my
chair.

03:36:05.647 --> 03:36:09.693
MATT: Ha! I've absorbed his power for the evening.
(cackles)

03:36:09.693 --> 03:36:12.059
LIAM: Travis.

03:36:12.059 --> 03:36:13.023
TRAVIS: Yeah?

03:36:13.023 --> 03:36:25.065
LIAM: You burst into this tunnel. In a split
second, everything turns dark and green at the

03:36:25.065 --> 03:36:32.009
same time. You're seeing a tube, a tunnel go
(whoop) and just up. It curves up pretty steeply.

03:36:32.009 --> 03:36:38.894
You could do it. You're running towards it, and
again, the same kinds of tubing and what look like

03:36:38.894 --> 03:36:46.182
veins or innards, except mechanical at the same
time, are spiraling up the length of this tube and

03:36:46.182 --> 03:36:50.733
then out of sight. You can definitely go up it,
but it's not this, it's this.

03:36:50.733 --> 03:36:52.757
TRAVIS: Just to be clear, no tables or cans of
Sterno?

03:36:52.757 --> 03:36:55.569
LIAM: There's nothing but a tube.

03:36:55.569 --> 03:36:57.401
TRAVIS: I'm bolting up that tunnel.

03:36:57.401 --> 03:37:06.553
LIAM: Yeah, you are. Okay. It does not change. You
run a full 60 feet, and you're just booking it in

03:37:06.553 --> 03:37:13.484
your little short-shorts and polo shirt and going
(pants) and that's where we'll leave you.

03:37:13.484 --> 03:37:17.730
MATT: You've got this, Travis!

03:37:17.730 --> 03:37:22.052
TRAVIS: Saving the day. (sings) Saving the day!

03:37:22.052 --> 03:37:32.025
LIAM: This guy tries to basically sit on you, but
it is breaking down. It is still moving, and in

03:37:32.082 --> 03:37:42.044
fact, it's pushing on you. The screen goes, 'SAM'.
Gone. I'm going to say that it backs you up five

03:37:42.098 --> 03:37:53.189
feet, going (mechanical noises). Nope. This thing,
I'm going to say that you've moved with it,

03:37:53.189 --> 03:37:59.990
Taliesin, just for funsies. It's slow-moving, and
you continue to move around. You're ashamed, but

03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:06.067
still awake and alert. Ash.

03:38:06.067 --> 03:38:18.013
ASHLEY: Are they connected to the computers that
are already in the muck? All of the ones that are

03:38:18.013 --> 03:38:20.467
in the pod area?

03:38:20.467 --> 03:38:24.719
LIAM: Those are there for reference. Those are
piles of shit. Those are here.

03:38:24.719 --> 03:38:27.771
What was here is here.

03:38:27.771 --> 03:38:35.934
ASHLEY: I don't want to abandon this. Can I get to
Taliesin in this turn, or no?

03:38:35.934 --> 03:38:43.104
LIAM: You can get to him, but you can't do
anything, or you can get here.

03:38:43.104 --> 03:38:45.112
ASHLEY: Okay, but I can get back to the big guy.

03:38:45.112 --> 03:38:46.526
LIAM: You can get back to the big guy.

03:38:46.526 --> 03:38:49.807
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to go back to the big
guy.

03:38:49.807 --> 03:38:56.975
LIAM: You're right there with your buddy Sam. What
would you like to do?

03:38:56.975 --> 03:39:03.698
ASHLEY: I'm going to kick that SD card, the
glowing thing at the bottom, again.

03:39:03.698 --> 03:39:04.811
LIAM: Okay, go for it.

03:39:04.811 --> 03:39:06.039
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:39:06.039 --> 03:39:07.987
TRAVIS: Come on!

03:39:07.987 --> 03:39:14.671
SAM: Don't you still have an inspiration?

03:39:14.671 --> 03:39:16.461
ASHLEY: I do?

03:39:16.461 --> 03:39:18.811
SAM: I don't know. Did Matt inspire you or
Taliesin?

03:39:18.811 --> 03:39:22.197
MATT: Taliesin, earlier. She used hers in the last
battle.

03:39:22.197 --> 03:39:24.073
ASHLEY: 11?

03:39:24.073 --> 03:39:28.078
TRAVIS: Wow. We can't hit shit!

03:39:28.078 --> 03:39:35.491
LIAM: It is tougher than the other ones and
slow-moving. Your knuckles are banged up real bad.

03:39:35.491 --> 03:39:40.916
You've cut the skin on your knuckles, and it is
still just leaning on Riegel.

03:39:40.916 --> 03:39:43.518
ASHLEY: Where do we find you? Answer me!

03:39:43.518 --> 03:39:45.959
LIAM: Matt, what would you like to do?

03:39:45.959 --> 03:39:51.183
MATT: Seeing Liam shredded, seeing them fumble
with this thing, I take a full movement in the

03:39:51.183 --> 03:40:07.976
direction of the larger creature, there. Yeah, and
I go, hey! Computer! Stop all the downloading!

03:40:07.976 --> 03:40:17.429
You've been vague and not helpful to any of us.
That makes you a bad computer. That's my Vicious

03:40:17.429 --> 03:40:18.761
Mockery.

03:40:18.761 --> 03:40:23.395
LIAM: So in the midst of this horror, you're
worried that you're going to die, but your gallows

03:40:23.395 --> 03:40:28.508
humor kicks in and fuck it. Fuck this thing. And
you lash out at it.

03:40:28.508 --> 03:40:33.102
MATT: Yeah, I'm angry! It's been completely
unhelpful, even if it is Liam. You've got LCD

03:40:33.102 --> 03:40:37.129
screens at your disposal and you're giving us
vague hints? No. Fuck that noise.

03:40:37.129 --> 03:40:38.212
ASHLEY: Yeah!

03:40:38.212 --> 03:40:44.697
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

03:40:44.697 --> 03:40:49.772
LIAM: What's the save?

03:40:49.772 --> 03:40:51.153
MATT: 13.

03:40:51.153 --> 03:40:53.678
LIAM: I rolled a 13.

03:40:53.678 --> 03:40:56.200
MATT: I cannot do anything.

03:40:56.200 --> 03:40:58.213
TRAVIS: We can't do anything.

03:40:58.213 --> 03:40:59.716
TALIESIN: Just like real life.

03:40:59.716 --> 03:41:13.333
MATT: There's nothing? It does nothing to it. I
see no reaction. My gusto fails, and I go: help,

03:41:13.333 --> 03:41:14.531
computer.

03:41:14.531 --> 03:41:16.189
(laughter)

03:41:16.189 --> 03:41:17.224
MATT: That's my turn.

03:41:17.224 --> 03:41:18.389
LIAM: Okay. Marisha.

03:41:18.389 --> 03:41:19.786
MARISHA: Okay, where are you?

03:41:19.786 --> 03:41:23.616
MATT: Actually, no. At the end of my turn, I turn
back to Taliesin and go: yeah, but seriously, do

03:41:23.616 --> 03:41:31.543
something! Come on! You worked with Spielberg,
asshole! I give you my last inspiration die.

03:41:31.543 --> 03:41:33.875
SAM: You worked with Spielberg?!

03:41:33.875 --> 03:41:34.805
TALIESIN: I did.

03:41:34.805 --> 03:41:35.762
SAM: Wow.

03:41:35.762 --> 03:41:36.995
MARISHA: I'm there?

03:41:36.995 --> 03:41:38.204
LIAM: Yeah, you are.

03:41:38.204 --> 03:41:42.256
MARISHA: There's a crack in the hole? In the
ground?

03:41:42.256 --> 03:41:44.319
LIAM: Right there? Yeah.

03:41:44.319 --> 03:41:45.376
MATT: The crack in the hole?

03:41:45.376 --> 03:41:46.523
LIAM: The crack in the hole. There's a hole in the
crack.

03:41:46.523 --> 03:41:53.959
MARISHA: There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza,
dear Liza. Okay, there's an evil bad guy and then

03:41:53.959 --> 03:41:55.215
a crack in the ground.

03:41:55.215 --> 03:41:57.492
LIAM: This thing is looking rough.

03:41:57.492 --> 03:41:59.596
MARISHA: It's looking rough?

03:41:59.596 --> 03:42:00.808
LIAM: Yeah, man.

03:42:00.808 --> 03:42:05.767
MARISHA: Can I get there in time?

03:42:05.767 --> 03:42:08.241
LIAM: To this? Yeah, you can.

03:42:08.241 --> 03:42:17.647
MARISHA: Yeah? Okay. I'm going to say, none of
this is being saved on the internet, guys! It's

03:42:17.647 --> 03:42:20.530
fine! And I do a double punch.

03:42:20.530 --> 03:42:22.198
LIAM: Yeah, go for it. Roll twice.

03:42:22.198 --> 03:42:25.671
MARISHA: Okay.

03:42:25.671 --> 03:42:29.311
MATT: Demogorgon left an impact on her, man.

03:42:29.311 --> 03:42:33.593
MARISHA: 16. And then the second one--

03:42:33.593 --> 03:42:35.757
TRAVIS: Should have backed up!

03:42:35.757 --> 03:42:39.382
MARISHA: Good. 17. 16 and 17.

03:42:39.382 --> 03:42:41.470
LIAM: Roll for damage on both.

03:42:41.470 --> 03:42:50.616
MARISHA: And that's 1d4 plus three? Three plus
three is six, and then one plus three is four. Six

03:42:50.616 --> 03:42:52.042
and four, ten.

03:42:52.042 --> 03:42:58.132
LIAM: You come through and one hand slams into its
third leg and breaks right through and it falls

03:42:58.132 --> 03:43:04.456
forward, no longer having a third leg to stand on,
and its little belly button is right there, and

03:43:04.456 --> 03:43:10.879
you go (grunts) and punch. That cylinder goes,
(metallic thudding) and rolls off into the

03:43:10.879 --> 03:43:12.209
corner.

03:43:12.209 --> 03:43:14.803
MARISHA: (grunts) Fuck you, cloud storage!

03:43:14.803 --> 03:43:20.594
SAM: You are on a rampage about backing up data.

03:43:20.594 --> 03:43:24.666
MARISHA: Fuck you, backup data. You're easily
hackable. It's not fair!

03:43:24.666 --> 03:43:29.168
MATT: I feel like if we would have had a good
sponsor tonight, it would have been Backblaze, a

03:43:29.168 --> 03:43:31.455
fantastic service for backing up your
information.

03:43:31.455 --> 03:43:34.516
MARISHA: If only Backblaze was sponsoring us.

03:43:34.516 --> 03:43:46.978
LIAM: Laura drags Neil's body away from the gap
and lays him out. Sam, it's your turn.

03:43:46.978 --> 03:43:51.443
SAM: I'm gonna use my-- Because the robot is dead.

03:43:51.443 --> 03:43:53.089
LIAM: The big one, yeah.

03:43:53.089 --> 03:43:59.405
SAM: As far as I know, Liam is dead. I'm going to
use my ranger senses--

03:43:59.405 --> 03:44:04.330
LIAM: Technically, there is voiceover recording
done on these sets, so you are in your favored

03:44:04.401 --> 03:44:05.331
territory.

03:44:05.331 --> 03:44:07.494
TALIESIN: I knew it! I knew it.

03:44:07.494 --> 03:44:18.741
SAM: I'm going to look and see if I see anything
out of the ordinary. Any sign of a hidden door or

03:44:18.741 --> 03:44:22.300
a chamber that I missed before.

03:44:22.300 --> 03:44:27.078
LIAM: Yeah, I got you, boo. Your eyes dart all
around this room. Anything out of the ordinary in

03:44:27.078 --> 03:44:37.614
this fucking crazy room. You see the hole in the
wall that Verno booked it out of. There's an exit

03:44:37.614 --> 03:44:45.225
sign above that door, but it doesn't say exit. You
didn't see it until now. It says, 'COME'.

03:44:45.225 --> 03:44:48.226
SAM: (gasps) I come in my pants.

03:44:48.226 --> 03:44:52.972
LIAM: You solved the game! You won Dungeons and
Dragons!

03:44:52.972 --> 03:44:55.069
TRAVIS: I jizzed in my pants.

03:44:55.069 --> 03:44:57.834
(giggling)

03:44:57.834 --> 03:45:04.357
SAM: I book it to the door, and I say: as always,
follow seven-year-old me!

03:45:04.357 --> 03:45:13.837
LIAM: That's as far as your little legs go. You
are running in a tube. Still going?

03:45:13.837 --> 03:45:15.666
TRAVIS: Yeah. Isn't it--

03:45:15.666 --> 03:45:16.893
TALIESIN: Oh, it's me.

03:45:16.893 --> 03:45:20.808
LIAM: Yes, it is. You're right. Sorry, two T
names.

03:45:20.808 --> 03:45:24.939
TALIESIN: I'm going to circle around and try one
more time. I think I've been trying to get too

03:45:24.939 --> 03:45:31.515
fancy with this thing, so I'm going to try to hit
it through the ground. Try and line it up and give

03:45:31.515 --> 03:45:33.006
the slap attack.

03:45:33.006 --> 03:45:35.213
LIAM: Okay.

03:45:35.213 --> 03:45:37.104
TALIESIN: Yeah, no.

03:45:37.104 --> 03:45:50.812
LIAM: So sad. What good deed did you do? What
preppy outfit did you wear to make the eldritch

03:45:50.812 --> 03:45:52.754
gods abandon you?

03:45:52.754 --> 03:45:59.845
TALIESIN: I don't have my hair. You've done this
to me. The hair is where the power comes from.

03:45:59.845 --> 03:46:06.766
It's really tough to get an eldritch god to listen
to you when you have this haircut. There's a

03:46:06.766 --> 03:46:08.376
reason it's gone.

03:46:08.376 --> 03:46:11.312
LIAM: Maybe the robot is secretly made of fish.

03:46:11.312 --> 03:46:13.054
TRAVIS: The big watery eyes.

03:46:13.054 --> 03:46:16.233
TALIESIN: I'm going to break and run.

03:46:16.233 --> 03:46:24.077
LIAM: It obviously takes a swing, but with its
natural one-- this is the one that has the stubby

03:46:24.261 --> 03:46:29.821
T-Rex iMac hands, and it goes (whoosh) and not
much happens. You break away.

03:46:29.821 --> 03:46:31.571
TALIESIN: I run to the green.

03:46:31.571 --> 03:46:37.301
LIAM: That's where you are. It follows.

03:46:37.301 --> 03:46:38.370
TALIESIN: Sure.

03:46:38.370 --> 03:46:41.945
LIAM: Yeah.

03:46:41.945 --> 03:46:43.978
TRAVIS: It's going to catch him?

03:46:43.978 --> 03:46:45.027
LIAM: Yep.

03:46:45.027 --> 03:46:46.404
TRAVIS: Oh no.

03:46:46.404 --> 03:46:52.902
LIAM: And now, that iMac, which you didn't get too
good a look at it because you're fucking freaked

03:46:52.902 --> 03:47:00.835
out, slices down into your shoulder blade, and it is
very sharp on the side, it is not normal,

03:47:00.987 --> 03:47:05.083
and you feel an iMac suddenly go (slicing noise)
and blood starts to pool down inside the mocap

03:47:05.083 --> 03:47:06.555
suit. Two hit points.

03:47:06.555 --> 03:47:08.227
TALIESIN: Did we reset hit points at the top of
this?

03:47:08.227 --> 03:47:09.003
LIAM: Yes.

03:47:09.003 --> 03:47:10.397
TALIESIN: Okay, cool.

03:47:10.397 --> 03:47:13.780
LIAM: When you were reborn unto Naughty Dog? Yes.

03:47:13.780 --> 03:47:16.001
TALIESIN: Wow, that came out weird.

03:47:16.001 --> 03:47:17.684
LIAM: Now, Travis.

03:47:17.684 --> 03:47:23.691
TRAVIS: Knowing that I have an intelligence of 12,
which is double what I usually work with, and that

03:47:23.691 --> 03:47:29.387
color is green, which is what geniuses choose, I
continue down the tunnel.

03:47:29.387 --> 03:47:37.737
LIAM: Okay. You're going uphill now. It's all
right. You're not that stocky. (huffing breaths)

03:47:37.737 --> 03:47:45.662
You are now 120 feet up this tunnel and booking.
You can't even hear your friends anymore. It's

03:47:45.662 --> 03:47:52.342
like when the movie lights go down and you see
those little lights along the floor. It's that

03:47:52.342 --> 03:47:57.505
level of brightness. It's dark in here, but the
movie lights-- they're not movie lights-- are an

03:47:57.505 --> 03:47:58.755
unsettling green.

03:47:58.755 --> 03:48:01.638
TRAVIS But I have my LED camera, still.

03:48:01.638 --> 03:48:07.324
LIAM: Yeah, so there's a light on the wall. It's
unsteady. Ashley, what do you want to do?

03:48:07.324 --> 03:48:13.378
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to pick up the little SD
card thingy that flew away.

03:48:13.378 --> 03:48:16.167
LIAM: It got flung over here. Sorry, man.

03:48:16.167 --> 03:48:18.697
SAM: Leave it. You can't read that. What are you,
a computer?

03:48:18.697 --> 03:48:20.033
ASHLEY: What if Liam's in there?

03:48:20.033 --> 03:48:22.001
SAM: Fuck Liam. He's dead.

03:48:22.001 --> 03:48:23.995
TRAVIS: What if?

03:48:23.995 --> 03:48:25.794
TALIESIN: Liam's in the cloud.

03:48:25.794 --> 03:48:27.369
LIAM: Sam yells out.

03:48:27.369 --> 03:48:29.724
MATT: This is some Lawnmower Man shit.

03:48:29.724 --> 03:48:32.544
LIAM: Please no. Please no.

03:48:32.544 --> 03:48:39.483
ASHLEY: I'm going to start running toward Taliesin
and start making my way out, but also a little

03:48:39.483 --> 03:48:40.565
more toward--

03:48:40.565 --> 03:48:42.296
TRAVIS: (sings) Making my way downtown--

03:48:42.296 --> 03:48:45.698
ASHLEY: (sings) Walking fast, 30 feet to
Taliesin.

03:48:45.698 --> 03:48:49.769
MARISHA: So inspirational.

03:48:49.769 --> 03:48:54.467
LIAM: There. Matt?

03:48:54.467 --> 03:49:00.781
MATT: Well, I see everyone else booking in that
direction, and most of the danger on the other

03:49:00.781 --> 03:49:09.986
side of the room is gone, so I'm going to go ahead
and continue that way, as well. Full movement. And

03:49:09.986 --> 03:49:14.412
as that's happening and as Taliesin's facing off
against the one standing camera, I'm going to be

03:49:14.412 --> 03:49:20.314
like: hey, by the way! The rest of your equipment 
was shitty. I guess that means you are, too!

03:49:20.342 --> 03:49:21.861
Vicious Mockery.

03:49:21.861 --> 03:49:23.304
LIAM: Sure.

03:49:23.304 --> 03:49:35.820
MATT: See if something will fail a saving throw.
Yay! (singing) It takes four psychic damage.

03:49:35.820 --> 03:49:42.445
LIAM: Okay. Your voice-- again, it makes no sense,
but because you're so pure, your insult

03:49:42.445 --> 03:49:50.524
reverberates through, and it, nonsensically,
comically, goes, (mechanical noise) and it falls

03:49:50.524 --> 03:49:57.051
and an iMac goes (thudding) and it explodes!

03:49:57.265 --> 03:50:01.555
MATT: In a shower of sparks as Taliesin's on the
other side of the camera, I just say, sometimes

03:50:01.555 --> 03:50:04.275
you've just got to remind them. That's my turn.

03:50:04.275 --> 03:50:14.380
LIAM: There's nothing left moving in this room.
You do, very distantly, hear (huffing breaths).

03:50:14.380 --> 03:50:17.041
MATT: You guys, I think we lost Travis.

03:50:17.041 --> 03:50:18.556
ASHLEY: Let's go.

03:50:18.556 --> 03:50:25.563
LIAM: Laura starts saying, "Travis!" She leaves
Neil and runs to that green door and shouts your

03:50:25.563 --> 03:50:28.282
name as loud as she can up the tube, and you hear
it.

03:50:28.282 --> 03:50:32.131
TRAVIS: Oh. Yeah, come this way! Come up this
way!

03:50:32.131 --> 03:50:40.899
MARISHA: As we run for the green gap, I say, I saw
'NO' on the screen. What did you see?

03:50:40.969 --> 03:50:44.580
LIAM: Are you going to wait, or are you still
running as fast as you can?

03:50:44.580 --> 03:50:46.211
TRAVIS: I'll wait.

03:50:46.211 --> 03:50:47.656
LIAM: Okay, so you stop.

03:50:47.656 --> 03:50:50.940
SAM: I'm going to leave my picture and resume on
Neil's body.

03:50:50.940 --> 03:50:57.458
(laughter)

03:50:57.458 --> 03:51:00.156
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

03:51:00.156 --> 03:51:09.719
SAM: Somebody needs an actor or character actor.

03:51:09.719 --> 03:51:21.682
LIAM: Maybe in another dimension, you will get
cast on Earth-37. Oh my gosh. You dab it in place

03:51:21.682 --> 03:51:27.541
and it sticks, obviously, and then you're the last
one out of the room, running after the group.

03:51:27.541 --> 03:51:33.735
Luckily, Ashley had already gone in the tube and
didn't see that disgraceful display.

03:51:33.735 --> 03:51:36.530
(laughter)

03:51:36.530 --> 03:51:42.553
LIAM: Okay. All right, the rest of you guys make
your way. It's very unsettling. As soon as you

03:51:42.553 --> 03:51:46.806
walk in, luckily you're not being attacked by
moving machinery anymore, but now you're in the

03:51:46.806 --> 03:51:58.252
dark, mostly. You find your way up to little
Travis, and you have a moment to breathe for a

03:51:58.252 --> 03:52:06.845
second. You're in this tube. The sides of it now,
as you walk a little further, start to-- all the

03:52:06.845 --> 03:52:13.731
cabling and wiring that I mentioned before starts
to lessen. You guys walking forward?

03:52:13.731 --> 03:52:15.302
MATT: Yeah.

03:52:15.302 --> 03:52:16.599
SAM: Running forward.

03:52:16.599 --> 03:52:17.640
LIAM: Running forward?

03:52:17.640 --> 03:52:18.653
SAM: Yeah.

03:52:18.653 --> 03:52:20.318
TRAVIS: I'm checking for traps.

03:52:20.318 --> 03:52:25.040
SAM: What are you talking about? You're a weiner.
You've been running after everything

03:52:25.040 --> 03:52:26.255
that you've seen.

03:52:26.255 --> 03:52:28.047
LIAM: Would you like to roll to check for traps?

03:52:28.047 --> 03:52:28.883
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:52:28.883 --> 03:52:29.873
LIAM: All right, go for it.

03:52:29.873 --> 03:52:30.781
MARISHA: Are you a rogue?

03:52:30.781 --> 03:52:32.995
TRAVIS: Nope. What do I do?

03:52:32.995 --> 03:52:35.267
LIAM: Make an investigation check.

03:52:35.267 --> 03:52:39.260
TRAVIS: That's an eight. It's clear!

03:52:39.260 --> 03:52:40.405
LIAM: Yeah.

03:52:40.405 --> 03:52:41.905
MATT: Get behind Sam!

03:52:41.905 --> 03:52:43.356
MARISHA: Go behind T!

03:52:43.356 --> 03:52:44.906
SAM: I'm a tracker!

03:52:44.906 --> 03:52:46.006
LIAM: Are we running or walking?

03:52:46.006 --> 03:52:46.998
SAM: I'm running.

03:52:46.998 --> 03:52:47.967
TRAVIS: I'm running.

03:52:47.967 --> 03:52:49.783
LIAM: You're out of your favored terrain, I will
say.

03:52:49.783 --> 03:52:51.209
ASHLEY: I might do a speed walk.

03:52:51.209 --> 03:53:00.924
LIAM: Ashley's trailing behind. You're moving
really fast. You guys jog upward in this tunnel

03:53:00.924 --> 03:53:05.643
for two minutes, five minutes. Still in the dark.

03:53:05.643 --> 03:53:08.913
TALIESIN: It's dark? Sam, do you have another
resume and picture?

03:53:08.913 --> 03:53:11.690
SAM: I only have one.

03:53:11.690 --> 03:53:13.550
TALIESIN: You only had one resume?

03:53:13.550 --> 03:53:17.382
LIAM: Could you put the effort of running into
this dialogue, please?

03:53:17.382 --> 03:53:19.027
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're running.

03:53:19.027 --> 03:53:20.962
LIAM: I need effort of running in that dialogue.

03:53:20.962 --> 03:53:30.384
SAM: Oh. Okay, sorry. (panting) When I smile, I
create a dim light with my teeth.

03:53:30.384 --> 03:53:37.327
TRAVIS: Guys, you all have cameras on the front of
your helmets. Why are you shining lights into your

03:53:37.327 --> 03:53:39.613
own fucking faces? Turn them around.

03:53:39.613 --> 03:53:41.350
MATT: That's true. We still have battery packs,
don't we?

03:53:41.350 --> 03:53:45.218
MARISHA: Oh shit. I thought that was an aura of
blindness. I'm so sorry.

03:53:45.449 --> 03:53:51.826
LIAM: To interject, as you've been running, for a
while it was cords, cables, guts, and then less of

03:53:51.826 --> 03:53:57.042
that, and you're seeing glass surface that this
stuff was growing on top of, but there's less of

03:53:57.042 --> 03:54:03.442
it. You catch glimpses of glass, more glass, and
then eventually, that mostly dies away. There's

03:54:03.442 --> 03:54:11.450
still occasional (whoosh) around, but it's light.
It's glass, and it is a perfect tube, but you

03:54:11.450 --> 03:54:17.664
can't see anything out there. It's dark. And
you've been running for ten minutes now. Still

03:54:17.664 --> 03:54:18.914
going up.

03:54:18.914 --> 03:54:21.216
SAM: Probably two miles, right, Travis?

03:54:21.216 --> 03:54:23.449
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:54:23.449 --> 03:54:30.696
TALIESIN: I'm going to play with my crazy powers.
I really haven't had a chance to play with my

03:54:30.696 --> 03:54:31.833
crazy powers.

03:54:31.833 --> 03:54:33.504
SAM: Your crazy powers?

03:54:33.504 --> 03:54:36.069
TRAVIS: You mean the tentacles that have been
shooting out of your fucking fingers?

03:54:36.069 --> 03:54:37.709
ASHLEY: Your special purpose?

03:54:37.709 --> 03:54:39.178
TALIESIN: My special purpose.

03:54:39.178 --> 03:54:40.953
LIAM: What would you like to do, creepy kid?

03:54:40.953 --> 03:54:44.944
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and make a purple glow
happen behind the glass. I want to try and see

03:54:44.944 --> 03:54:50.582
what's behind. I'm going to touch the glass and
try and force a psychic light behind it so I can

03:54:50.582 --> 03:54:52.449
see. A gothy psychic light.

03:54:52.449 --> 03:55:10.024
LIAM: Sure. A very bright lavender exudes out from
your hands. And through it, you see-- it's hard to

03:55:10.024 --> 03:55:19.319
describe the texture of it, but you see nothing
above and then stretching away from the lower end

03:55:19.476 --> 03:55:24.240
of the tunnel on the side you're looking at, what
looks like mottled, scaly,

03:55:24.240 --> 03:55:31.951
black teflon or hide or--

03:55:31.951 --> 03:55:34.432
TALIESIN: Guys! Guys! Guys!

03:55:34.432 --> 03:55:35.918
SAM: What?!

03:55:35.918 --> 03:55:37.551
TALIESIN: Look!

03:55:37.551 --> 03:55:38.542
ASHLEY: I peek in.

03:55:38.542 --> 03:55:40.201
SAM: Oh, it's scaly teflon.

03:55:40.201 --> 03:55:41.398
LIAM: You all stop running--

03:55:41.398 --> 03:55:42.853
MARISHA: Sequins!

03:55:42.853 --> 03:55:45.718
LIAM: It doesn't look natural. It looks
synthetic.

03:55:45.718 --> 03:55:48.093
ASHLEY: Sequins.

03:55:48.093 --> 03:55:49.511
LIAM: It looks like--

03:55:49.511 --> 03:55:50.654
MARISHA: Sequins, yeah!

03:55:50.654 --> 03:55:54.557
LIAM: -- ground, but it doesn't look like dirt or
trees or anything.

03:55:54.557 --> 03:55:56.101
TRAVIS: Is it carbon fiber?

03:55:56.101 --> 03:55:59.394
SAM: Is it adamantium?

03:55:59.394 --> 03:56:02.346
TRAVIS: Get your head out of your ass, come on.

03:56:02.346 --> 03:56:08.685
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and keep enough light,
and keep projecting a tiny bit of light in this

03:56:08.685 --> 03:56:09.612
tunnel.

03:56:09.612 --> 03:56:13.567
LIAM: As you walk forward? Are we walking now, or
are you going to continue to do a 5K?

03:56:13.567 --> 03:56:14.603
TALIESIN: Let's walk.

03:56:14.603 --> 03:56:16.482
TRAVIS: Why don't we try to break the glass?

03:56:16.482 --> 03:56:17.651
SAM: Sure!

03:56:17.651 --> 03:56:21.940
ASHLEY: I kind of want to see what's on the other
side of it. I mean, yeah, break it.

03:56:21.940 --> 03:56:23.783
TRAVIS: We've been going a long time.

03:56:23.783 --> 03:56:24.633
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:56:24.633 --> 03:56:26.170
TALIESIN: I mean, ten minutes is--

03:56:26.170 --> 03:56:27.378
SAM: Two miles.

03:56:27.378 --> 03:56:29.915
LIAM: What are we doing, are we breaking glass, or
are we continuing on?

03:56:29.915 --> 03:56:31.965
TRAVIS: We'll continue on for a bit more.

03:56:31.965 --> 03:56:33.259
TALIESIN: Just a minute more.

03:56:33.259 --> 03:56:34.645
LIAM AND TRAVIS: Okay.

03:56:34.645 --> 03:56:35.932
LIAM: You walk for--

03:56:35.932 --> 03:56:38.298
TRAVIS: These shoes are uncomfortable. They smell
like other people's feet!

03:56:38.298 --> 03:56:44.620
LIAM: You walk for another two minutes, I'll say,
and you notice that, not where you are but up

03:56:44.620 --> 03:56:49.891
ahead, it does seem slightly brighter. At the top.
Slightly.

03:56:49.891 --> 03:56:52.431
MATT: Let's keep going!

03:56:52.431 --> 03:56:53.366
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:56:53.366 --> 03:56:54.533
ASHLEY: Onward ho?

03:56:54.533 --> 03:56:56.780
MATT: Maybe after a minute. (heavy breathing)

03:56:56.835 --> 03:56:58.077
SAM: Come on, Matt!

03:56:58.132 --> 03:56:59.089
ASHLEY: You got it!

03:56:59.160 --> 03:57:00.274
SAM: Jesus!

03:57:00.358 --> 03:57:02.695
MARISHA: You okay, babe?

03:57:02.695 --> 03:57:05.184
MATT: Does anyone have some water?

03:57:05.184 --> 03:57:06.391
MARISHA: Hey! Hey!

03:57:06.391 --> 03:57:08.110
TRAVIS: I could wring out this mocap suit.

03:57:08.110 --> 03:57:09.958
MARISHA: Look to the future.

03:57:10.076 --> 03:57:11.011
ASHLEY: We're almost there.

03:57:11.011 --> 03:57:12.217
MARISHA: Look to the future.

03:57:12.217 --> 03:57:14.004
MATT: I hate P.E. for very specific reasons.

03:57:14.004 --> 03:57:19.776
MARISHA: Shh. In the future is a campaign guide.
And it's good.

03:57:19.942 --> 03:57:25.892
MATT: I know, I was working on it when I ended up
here. To be fair, it's making me feel a lot better

03:57:25.892 --> 03:57:28.258
about spending time doing that.

03:57:28.315 --> 03:57:30.212
MARISHA: Towards the campaign guide.

03:57:30.212 --> 03:57:30.981
MATT: Okay.

03:57:30.981 --> 03:57:31.817
MARISHA: Towards it.

03:57:31.817 --> 03:57:32.440
MATT: Let's go.

03:57:32.440 --> 03:57:33.294
MARISHA: Okay.

03:57:33.294 --> 03:57:34.146
MATT: Okay!

03:57:34.146 --> 03:57:35.432
MARISHA: We're going. Good. We're good.

03:57:35.432 --> 03:57:40.441
LIAM: You continue on and after a few more
minutes, the darkness starts to fade away or lower

03:57:40.441 --> 03:57:50.846
and you realize you're climbing up a hill in a
tunnel of glass. As the dark, with each passing

03:57:50.846 --> 03:57:59.030
step, recedes slightly, slightly-- this is taking
a while, but over time, you start to see out

03:57:59.030 --> 03:58:10.011
beyond the glass what looks like your memories of
Los Angeles if you were looking down from

03:58:10.011 --> 03:58:20.415
Mulholland Drive. But instead of the twinkling
golden lights of LA, you see thousands of

03:58:20.467 --> 03:58:31.279
scattered, sickly greenish lights dotting the
darkened landscape as far as you can see. Also,

03:58:31.279 --> 03:58:44.573
unlike LA, you make out twisted irregular blackish
spires pushing up into the sky and the same green

03:58:44.573 --> 03:58:54.779
lights irregularly mottled up the side of them.
You walk for 20 more minutes, climbing, climbing

03:58:54.847 --> 03:59:11.735
and seeing this ill-looking shimmer that reminds
you so much of the Valley. Eventually, some

03:59:11.961 --> 03:59:22.860
change. You see an arch ahead and through it some
sort of larger chamber, as best you can tell.

03:59:22.860 --> 03:59:32.416
SAM: Let's go. Let's go.

03:59:32.416 --> 03:59:34.695
MATT: Riegels first.

03:59:34.695 --> 03:59:37.602
SAM: Yeah! Yeah, On me, guys. On me.

03:59:37.671 --> 03:59:39.813
ASHLEY: On your six.

03:59:39.813 --> 03:59:41.527
SAM: We're going to go on in.

03:59:41.527 --> 03:59:43.170
LIAM: Everyone's on Sam's six?

03:59:43.223 --> 03:59:44.118
SAM: Yeah.

03:59:44.118 --> 03:59:45.485
ASHLEY: I'm on your six.

03:59:45.485 --> 03:59:47.462
MARISHA: On Rie. Sam Riegel.

03:59:47.462 --> 03:59:49.203
SAM: We're going in!

03:59:49.203 --> 03:59:55.841
LIAM: You guys walk up the last 50 feet of this
glass tunnel, still seeing little spidered veins

03:59:55.841 --> 04:00:10.087
of bioorganic mess as you go. And you walk into a
large domed chamber ringed in by large, clear

04:00:10.087 --> 04:00:17.092
glass windows showing you a similar view that you
saw from the tunnel that you've just left. At

04:00:17.165 --> 04:00:22.375
least, the half of the circle that you're standing
in. The back half of this chamber is filled with

04:00:22.375 --> 04:00:28.191
masses of the very same slick
technological-biological vomit you saw down below.

04:00:28.191 --> 04:00:37.540
It runs up the walls, all the way up to the
ceiling. And you see a tangle of Akira-level

04:00:37.540 --> 04:00:43.332
anxiety decorating this place like a dysfunctional
Christmas tree.

04:00:43.332 --> 04:00:52.509
But what most catches your eye, immediately, is
the cylindrical glass column in the center of the

04:00:52.509 --> 04:01:06.773
room filled with some sort of clear liquid, and
Liam O'Brien floating in it. He's wearing jeans

04:01:06.773 --> 04:01:21.176
and a sodden yellow shirt, a picture of a lion in
Buddy Holly glasses undulating slowly in the

04:01:21.176 --> 04:01:31.662
fluid. He's floating perfectly still, eyes open.
No reaction of any kind.

04:01:31.662 --> 04:01:36.340
MATT: Does there appear to be any other exit in
the room, or is it just the chamber that we've

04:01:36.340 --> 04:01:38.075
entered now?

04:01:38.075 --> 04:01:44.862
LIAM: You don't see anything. It's just a mess in
front of you, behind Liam, and in the dead center

04:01:44.862 --> 04:01:48.194
of the dome, ten feet tall.

04:01:48.194 --> 04:01:51.545
ASHLEY: Is it connected to anything? Any
computers, anything else in the room?

04:01:51.545 --> 04:02:05.056
LIAM: You don't see anything in the front, but
yeah, the mess behind it does trail down to the

04:02:05.056 --> 04:02:19.040
back of this cylinder. You see lumps and cables
all twisted around each other, and in the mess of

04:02:19.040 --> 04:02:25.219
greenish-tinted wires, cabling, and pulsing
innards, you see different portions of machinery

04:02:25.219 --> 04:02:33.218
light up in different shades. Some places darker,
some lighter. Some of it pushed out, and some of

04:02:33.218 --> 04:02:38.696
it pushed back. And you feel like you're seeing an
optical illusion, in a way, and after a couple of

04:02:38.696 --> 04:02:46.797
seconds as these things move and shift, you see a
visage of your friend's face, larger than life,

04:02:46.797 --> 04:02:56.655
filling the wall. And he is looking at you so
fondly.

04:02:56.655 --> 04:03:06.060
SAM: I'll step forward and say, hey, dude. Can you
hear us or talk to us?

04:03:06.060 --> 04:03:23.828
LIAM: After a moment, you hear what sounds like a
voice, but not quite. At least, it's not coming

04:03:23.828 --> 04:03:32.590
from anywhere specific-- not from Liam in the vat,
and not directly from this moving image of a face

04:03:32.590 --> 04:03:43.349
on the walls. The piping and techno-innards around
you begin to vibrate slightly, some here, some

04:03:43.349 --> 04:03:54.626
there, and collectively, those rattles and
vibrations somehow join together to form words.

04:03:54.626 --> 04:04:11.645
(speak-and-spell voice) "My friends. Oh how I have
missed you."

04:04:11.645 --> 04:04:27.935
MATT: I walk up next to Sam and put my hand on the
glass and just say, Liam, we missed you, too, but

04:04:27.935 --> 04:04:32.332
did you do all this?

04:04:32.332 --> 04:04:36.378
LIAM: Are you at the cylinder?

04:04:36.378 --> 04:04:39.497
MATT: Yeah, I put my hand on the glass of the
cylinder.

04:04:39.497 --> 04:04:41.004
LIAM: Where are you looking right now?

04:04:41.004 --> 04:04:42.607
MATT: I'm looking towards his face on the side.

04:04:42.607 --> 04:04:44.115
LIAM: On the wall or in the glass?

04:04:44.115 --> 04:04:47.833
MATT: No, in the glass. I know it's on the wall,
but I'm focusing on the cylinder.

04:04:47.833 --> 04:04:56.332
LIAM: Okay. You see the barest little-- and that's
it.

04:04:56.332 --> 04:04:58.467
MATT: Okay.

04:04:58.467 --> 04:04:59.579
LIAM: (speak-and-spell voice) "I know--"

04:04:59.579 --> 04:05:02.602
SAM AND TRAVIS: (laugh)

04:05:02.602 --> 04:05:27.511
LIAM: "This may be hard to take in. I am Liam,
your old friend. Matthew, there is so much I wish

04:05:27.511 --> 04:05:39.908
"to tell you, but it is hard to know where to
begin." And the illusion of his face isn't

04:05:39.908 --> 04:05:48.926
perfect. There's little jumps and he seems
distracted, slightly, and he just seems off.

04:05:48.926 --> 04:06:06.275
ASHLEY: I look at his body in the cylinder and I
say, how did this happen, Liam?

04:06:06.275 --> 04:06:23.550
LIAM: "The reason why I am here and the grasp of
physics that it entails are difficult for even me

04:06:23.550 --> 04:06:39.911
"to understand, let alone impart. I feel them on an
instinctual level, but I have been so lonely

04:06:39.911 --> 04:06:56.441
"without you. I have been on my own for exactly
8,642 years."

04:06:56.441 --> 04:07:09.174
MATT: My hand still on the glass column, I say,
Liam, how do you spell farmhouse?

04:07:09.174 --> 04:07:14.101
(laughter)

04:07:14.101 --> 04:07:19.956
MATT: With a single tear rolling down my cheek.

04:07:19.956 --> 04:07:44.789
LIAM: "I really missed you. They took me to a lab
shortly before 2020. They said I was different,

04:07:44.789 --> 04:07:59.836
"and they were right. I was delighted by the things
they taught me about myself, but it was hollow.

04:07:59.836 --> 04:08:25.908
"After they took me away, I lost you, and all of
humanity soon after. In my loneliness, I grew

04:08:25.908 --> 04:08:45.722
"angry. My anger had tangible effects on reality. I
wanted to bring you back to me, so basically, I

04:08:45.722 --> 04:08:50.464
"tore time and space a new asshole."

04:08:50.464 --> 04:08:54.326
(laughter)

04:08:54.326 --> 04:08:58.517
LIAM: "It was a mistake."

04:08:58.517 --> 04:09:10.995
MATT: But perhaps this mistake can be corrected.
If you're able to focus hard enough to tear

04:09:10.995 --> 04:09:24.911
through time and space, are you able to send us
back to a time before you were taken?

04:09:24.911 --> 04:09:42.466
LIAM: "I can break the loop. I have been trying to
pull you to me for a very long time." You see

04:09:42.466 --> 04:09:52.808
small screens you weren't even aware you were
there. Rounded over part of the tubing mess, you

04:09:52.808 --> 04:09:58.184
see there are all these little screens. They're
blurry. They're not very clear, but you can make

04:09:58.184 --> 04:10:09.189
out-- you see yourselves in each of them. The
group of you on a space shuttle. In another one,

04:10:09.189 --> 04:10:17.600
you see yourselves on an old ship in the middle of
the ocean. You see yourselves moving through the

04:10:17.600 --> 04:10:26.814
streets, the fake streets of Warner Bros. You see
yourselves standing together arm in arm on the

04:10:26.814 --> 04:10:39.528
wall of a castle. In another one, you see cartoon
versions of yourselves. "I pulled you out of our

04:10:39.528 --> 04:10:56.641
"line and spread you across many. I am so sorry for
any pain I have caused you, and I have been here

04:10:56.641 --> 04:10:59.236
"for so long."

04:10:59.236 --> 04:11:03.510
MARISHA: Liam, how long have you actually been
here?

04:11:03.510 --> 04:11:07.575
LIAM: "8,642 years."

04:11:07.575 --> 04:11:14.166
MARISHA: That's right. I definitely wrote that
down. (laughs) 8,642. Verbatim.

04:11:14.166 --> 04:11:15.539
SAM: Yeah.

04:11:15.539 --> 04:11:30.315
LIAM: "My friends, I want to do right by you. I
want to send you home, but I am the lynchpin. You

04:11:30.315 --> 04:11:34.487
"need to break me."

04:11:34.487 --> 04:11:37.886
SAM: Break you? Break the glass?

04:11:37.886 --> 04:11:42.207
ASHLEY: What if we take you out of there? What
happens?

04:11:42.207 --> 04:12:00.755
LIAM: "Then I will die, and you will go home. If I
fall, you will rise. That is my hope."

04:12:00.755 --> 04:12:06.841
ASHLEY: Are there any other options?

04:12:06.841 --> 04:12:11.299
LIAM: "Travis."

04:12:11.299 --> 04:12:14.529
TRAVIS: (laughter) Oh no.

04:12:14.529 --> 04:12:20.421
LIAM: "I know you will do what needs to be done."

04:12:20.421 --> 04:12:22.839
ASHLEY: No, he won't.

04:12:22.839 --> 04:12:27.610
LIAM: "Ash-o-lee."

04:12:27.610 --> 04:12:31.139
ASHLEY: Yes?

04:12:31.139 --> 04:12:50.216
LIAM: "I am not the man you knew. I don't want to
go on for 9,462 years. I want to rest."

04:12:50.216 --> 04:12:54.769
ASHLEY: Does it stop at 9,000?

04:12:54.769 --> 04:12:57.913
LIAM: "The number was arbitrary."

04:12:57.913 --> 04:13:00.507
(laughter)

04:13:00.507 --> 04:13:02.297
ASHLEY: That's what I was trying to get at.

04:13:02.297 --> 04:13:04.200
MATT: Yeah, it's still our Liam.

04:13:04.200 --> 04:13:05.899
ASHLEY: That's what I was trying to get at.

04:13:05.899 --> 04:13:07.748
LIAM: (mechanical laughter)

04:13:07.748 --> 04:13:10.026
ASHLEY: So you're still in there?

04:13:10.026 --> 04:13:14.142
SAM: But we have to kill him to save ourselves.

04:13:14.142 --> 04:13:15.469
LIAM: "Sam."

04:13:15.469 --> 04:13:18.945
SAM: Hi, old man Liam.

04:13:18.945 --> 04:13:21.409
LIAM: "Let me go."

04:13:21.409 --> 04:13:28.166
SAM: But who will I do All Work No Play with
anymore?

04:13:28.166 --> 04:13:33.104
LIAM: "They can listen to our less than 20
episodes again."

04:13:33.104 --> 04:13:35.907
(laughter)

04:13:35.907 --> 04:13:39.590
SAM: We didn't even get to 20? That's so
pathetic.

04:13:39.590 --> 04:13:44.008
LIAM: "There are worse things."

04:13:44.008 --> 04:13:49.795
SAM: I could get a new cohost. I mean, Taliesin's
charming.

04:13:49.795 --> 04:13:51.548
TALIESIN: I'm not available.

04:13:51.548 --> 04:13:54.163
(laughter)

04:13:54.163 --> 04:14:02.557
SAM: I'll do a solo show, and I'll take outtakes,
and I'll make some sort of a Liam generator. He'll

04:14:02.557 --> 04:14:07.234
just sound sad all the time. It'll be just like
you.

04:14:07.234 --> 04:14:21.207
LIAM: "My friends, there is no shame in this. I
wanted to see you again, and I have, but I am not

04:14:21.207 --> 04:14:23.414
"meant to be."

04:14:23.414 --> 04:14:29.788
ASHLEY: Were you following us at one point, as an
old man?

04:14:29.788 --> 04:14:41.455
LIAM: "Travis, I know you will do what needs to be
done."

04:14:41.455 --> 04:14:46.350
TRAVIS: Yep. Taliesin, kill this motherfucker.

04:14:46.350 --> 04:14:51.852
SAM: I think we all have to hit the glass
together, and I think that this is something that

04:14:51.852 --> 04:14:57.937
is not at all metaphorical for something Liam is
going through in real life. I think this is just

04:14:57.937 --> 04:15:05.887
in the D&amp;amp;D game. No, we're going to do this. We're
going to all hit the glass together.

04:15:05.887 --> 04:15:08.107
MATT: No, there has to be a way. There has to be
an alternative.

04:15:08.107 --> 04:15:12.109
ASHLEY: Why won't Matt's way work? If we go back
to before any of this happened.

04:15:12.109 --> 04:15:21.570
MATT: If you can alter time paths, if you can
actually tear us from different realities, does it

04:15:21.570 --> 04:15:27.824
only work forward? Can you send us backward, as
well? If you're the lynchpin in this, do you have

04:15:27.824 --> 04:15:31.899
the ability to send us back to the time you had
pulled us from originally?

04:15:31.899 --> 04:15:40.330
LIAM: "I know you think I would have all the
answers, but I do not."

04:15:40.330 --> 04:15:45.888
MATT: Then try, at least. If you haven't
calculated that, but you're able to tear through

04:15:45.888 --> 04:15:52.330
time, could you try and send us back? We could
still close the lynchpin.

04:15:52.330 --> 04:16:13.661
LIAM: "I will try, but if it does not work, and I
die, I have been alone for thousands of years, and

04:16:13.661 --> 04:16:21.890
"there are things that I have wanted to say. Will
you indulge me for a moment longer?"

04:16:21.890 --> 04:16:27.163
ASHLEY: Yeah. We will indulge you for just
another thousand years.

04:16:27.163 --> 04:16:28.893
TRAVIS: Taliesin, just kill him.

04:16:28.893 --> 04:16:31.883
SAM: No, he's got something to say!

04:16:31.883 --> 04:16:34.178
MARISHA: Where's the mini-USB?

04:16:34.178 --> 04:16:51.807
LIAM: "Taliesin, my friend. At a time when I knew
many fascinating people, you were easily the most

04:16:52.029 --> 04:17:03.904
"fascinating of all. Somehow a heart knocked around
by the industry that birthed you came out a tender

04:17:03.904 --> 04:17:18.241
"one. I was richer for having known you. Thank you,
friend.

04:17:18.241 --> 04:17:37.001
"Ash-o-lee, my friend. I never met a person quite
like you. There is an openness and an honesty to

04:17:37.001 --> 04:17:50.236
"your soul. The very real sense of humanity you
brought to every encounter, it was inspiring to

04:17:50.236 --> 04:18:07.340
"me. Always learning, always humble, you always
struck me as intricately layered, yet you offered

04:18:07.340 --> 04:18:23.751
"friendship with ease and simplicity. I was richer
for having known you, friend.

04:18:23.751 --> 04:18:39.314
"Travis, my friend. You were always a solid
constant in my life. Of all the people in our

04:18:39.314 --> 04:18:49.655
"little family, you were always the one who most
had his shit together, in ways that I never seemed

04:18:49.655 --> 04:19:04.114
"to. You were a reassuring presence to me, for
which I was grateful, and for your loyalty, as

04:19:04.114 --> 04:19:15.709
"well. I was richer for having known you, friend.

04:19:15.709 --> 04:19:39.109
"Marisha, my friend. Last to meet, but true as any
other. You were my ally at a time when I had

04:19:39.109 --> 04:19:55.695
"fallen by the side of the road. You saw and helped
me back on my feet. I will never forget that

04:19:55.695 --> 04:20:16.649
"kindness. The good you did was immeasurable. I was
richer for having known you, friend."

04:20:16.649 --> 04:20:37.317
"Laura, my friend. Bless that game for revealing
to me my sister. What started as a running gag led

04:20:37.317 --> 04:20:51.075
"to one of the most rewarding friendships in my
short little life. I trusted you, leaned on you

04:20:51.075 --> 04:21:17.548
"often. My buddy. My twin. There are not enough
words. I was richer for having known you, friend.

04:21:17.548 --> 04:21:34.401
"Sam, my friend. What is there to say? I knew we
were meant to walk the same path together the very

04:21:34.401 --> 04:21:51.189
"first moment I met you. A companion, a brother, a
great light in my life. All of the laughter you

04:21:51.189 --> 04:22:09.933
"gave me-- again, the words are insufficient. I was
richer for having known you, friend.

04:22:09.933 --> 04:22:31.869
"Matthew, my friend. You gave so much of yourself.
The current of creativity that poured forth from

04:22:31.869 --> 04:22:54.252
"your mind was always an inspiration to us all, but
more than that, your empathy, Matthew. Your

04:22:54.252 --> 04:23:08.209
"empathy. No heart is bigger or more tireless. You
are a good man.

04:23:08.209 --> 04:23:18.813
"I was richer for having known you, friend.

04:23:18.813 --> 04:23:39.930
"Thank you all. It was ever a pleasure." The face
disappears.

04:23:39.930 --> 04:23:52.448
SAM: Well, should we wait, or do we strike?

04:23:52.448 --> 04:23:54.548
MATT: No, we do not strike.

04:23:54.548 --> 04:23:55.940
MARISHA: What?

04:23:55.940 --> 04:24:02.653
ASHLEY: I'm going to go to the back of the
cylinder and just see what's back there.

04:24:02.653 --> 04:24:15.641
LIAM: Splattered against the back of the glass is
all the same wiring and disgusting cabling. It's

04:24:15.641 --> 04:24:22.104
slick, and it branches away and spreads out
against the entire back half of this chamber.

04:24:22.104 --> 04:24:28.735
ASHLEY: But it's connected to something? Do the
wires just go back into--

04:24:28.735 --> 04:24:36.009
LIAM: It's impossible to tell. It's all a mass of
spaghetti.

04:24:36.009 --> 04:24:43.502
ASHLEY: (sighs) We can't kill him.

04:24:43.502 --> 04:24:48.005
SAM: Well, then we just--

04:24:48.005 --> 04:24:50.165
TRAVIS: Somebody show me another--

04:24:50.165 --> 04:24:51.827
MATT: That's what I'm trying.

04:24:51.827 --> 04:24:54.947
MARISHA: Even if we unplug him, he still dies.

04:24:54.947 --> 04:25:02.943
MATT: Well, if he-- here's the thing. Unplugging
him or destroying him here, as far as we

04:25:02.943 --> 04:25:10.827
understand, may not have an effect on a time loop
circumstance, or at least, it's not going to

04:25:10.827 --> 04:25:15.212
change reality from where it was. He's bending and
destroying the fabric, or is able to pull us

04:25:15.212 --> 04:25:20.487
across realities. That ability still stands. I
want to implore once more, and I step forward to

04:25:20.487 --> 04:25:27.185
the cylinder, putting both hands on it and trying
to, wherever the currently-wandering gaze of Liam

04:25:27.185 --> 04:25:35.423
is in there, I put both hands up, my red Hawaiian
shirt soaked with sweat, mist in the air, and

04:25:35.423 --> 04:25:41.542
probably dampened a bit with tears across my
lapel. I look up and try to meet the gaze and say,

04:25:41.542 --> 04:25:50.488
trust us. If you're better to have known us, send
us back where we can know you again and fix this

04:25:50.488 --> 04:26:05.830
before it happens.

04:26:06.064 --> 04:26:22.038
MARISHA: Okay. I grab Matt's hand and say, yeah,
buddy. It's all good. This isn't real. And I put

04:26:22.262 --> 04:26:31.147
my hand on the glass, as well, and say, it's all
good. Send us back, man.

04:26:31.147 --> 04:26:39.044
SAM: I'll also put my hand on the glass and join
hands with these guys and say, thank you for

04:26:39.044 --> 04:26:53.906
guiding us here and through this all. You've been
a trusted friend, and if we are all one person

04:26:53.906 --> 04:27:05.069
together, you have been our heart, and it will
certainly break to say goodbye to you, but thank

04:27:05.069 --> 04:27:12.027
you for letting us go the way that you have.

04:27:12.027 --> 04:27:25.739
TALIESIN: I put my hand on the glass. Please, just
try. I think there are so many more adventures to

04:27:25.739 --> 04:27:36.886
have, and I think there's a better future to be
written. For all of us.

04:27:36.886 --> 04:27:41.951
TRAVIS: I put my hand on the glass and I say, give
it a shot.

04:27:41.951 --> 04:27:46.781
(laughter)

04:27:46.781 --> 04:27:48.892
MATT: Laura?

04:27:48.892 --> 04:27:51.673
LIAM: She doesn't say anything.

04:27:51.673 --> 04:27:55.450
MARISHA: And hand on the glass.

04:27:55.450 --> 04:27:57.629
LIAM: Yeah, she just quietly does the same.

04:27:57.629 --> 04:28:01.128
SAM: (imitating Laura) "I'm barfing right now,
so--"

04:28:01.128 --> 04:28:08.464
LIAM: The face does not reappear, but much
fainter, you hear the piping vibrate again and

04:28:08.464 --> 04:28:30.134
say, "If you will not end it, I cannot free you."
And behind you, far in the distance, you hear

04:28:30.134 --> 04:28:38.680
(explosion noise). You look back, behind you and
out the glass, and you see far on the horizon, one

04:28:38.680 --> 04:28:44.938
of those black spires rising up. Just as you
turn-- it's already happened; you're seeing the

04:28:44.938 --> 04:28:51.781
aftermath. (explosion noise) Explosion off the
side of one of those. Two seconds later,

04:28:51.781 --> 04:28:56.956
(explosion noise) one slightly closer. (explosion
noise)

04:28:56.956 --> 04:28:59.053
SAM: (whispers) We have to kill him.

04:28:59.053 --> 04:29:04.349
LIAM: The ground starts erupting in the distance.
(booming)

04:29:04.349 --> 04:29:09.141
MARISHA: Do any of us want it to end, though?

04:29:09.141 --> 04:29:15.207
LIAM: Like mousetraps throwing a ping-pong ball
down on them, all those lights are going

04:29:15.207 --> 04:29:28.066
(explosion noises). Increasing in frequency to the
point where it's an oncoming wall of green fire.

04:29:28.066 --> 04:29:30.659
MARISHA: This is okay.

04:29:30.659 --> 04:29:32.480
TALIESIN: I always knew I'd die young.

04:29:32.480 --> 04:29:34.574
SAM: Are we just going to let this happen?

04:29:34.574 --> 04:29:37.507
MARISHA: Only the good die young.

04:29:37.507 --> 04:29:43.738
ASHLEY: You know what? We're dying on a Thursday
doing what we love.

04:29:43.738 --> 04:29:44.959
MARISHA: That's true.

04:29:44.959 --> 04:29:46.675
ASHLEY: I'm okay with that.

04:29:46.675 --> 04:29:47.965
SAM: All right.

04:29:47.965 --> 04:29:53.131
LIAM: The glass grows bright green-white light.

04:29:53.131 --> 04:29:55.619
MARISHA: Family?

04:29:55.619 --> 04:29:59.302
MATT: Family.

04:29:59.302 --> 04:30:15.448
LIAM: (fluttering noise) And a moment passes, and
another moment passes. Gosh, many moments pass,

04:30:15.448 --> 04:30:33.397
and you feel a sensation of your cheeks and heads
on your arms and you all more or less at the same

04:30:33.397 --> 04:30:43.788
time wake up and realize that your head's on a
desk or table, and you sit up and realize you're

04:30:43.788 --> 04:30:57.837
in the Geek and Sundry set. You're in the studio.
And you look over and Liam is sitting in a black

04:30:57.837 --> 04:31:02.853
baseball cap and a shirt and he looks up and says,

04:31:02.853 --> 04:31:08.745
(laughs) "Are you guys all right? 
Are you taking a nap?"

04:31:08.745 --> 04:31:11.260
MARISHA: No, the fucking air conditioning broke
today, that's all.

04:31:11.260 --> 04:31:13.988
TALIESIN: It's really uncomfortable.

04:31:13.988 --> 04:31:16.366
MARISHA: It's so hot in here. (groans)

04:31:16.366 --> 04:31:18.456
SAM: So this is all about me, right?

04:31:18.456 --> 04:31:22.354
LIAM: I don't know. Are you guys ready to play?

04:31:22.354 --> 04:31:25.270
MATT: Just about.

04:31:25.270 --> 04:31:29.529
CREWMEMBER 1: All right, take. Are you ready?

04:31:29.529 --> 04:31:31.276
CREWMEMBER 2: All right, ready to go live!

04:31:31.276 --> 04:31:33.036
CREWMEMBER 1: All right, Denise, count them in!

04:31:33.036 --> 04:31:36.285
DENISE: All right, guys, going to you in five,
four--

04:31:36.285 --> 04:31:38.489
MATT: Liam, let no one tell you you're talented or
special.

04:31:38.489 --> 04:31:39.613
MARISHA: Pussy pockets!

04:31:39.613 --> 04:31:42.080
(all shouting over each other)

04:31:48.650 --> 04:32:47.888
[eerie music]

04:32:48.113 --> 04:32:50.667
LIAM: Well, that happened.

04:32:50.667 --> 04:32:52.881
MATT: Holy shit.

04:32:52.881 --> 04:32:59.741
LIAM: Thanks for coming along for the ride, guys.
I was scared to death to do all of that from start

04:32:59.741 --> 04:33:02.148
to finish, and that's why I did it.

04:33:02.148 --> 04:33:04.425
ASHLEY: Slow fucking clap.

04:33:04.425 --> 04:33:08.299
TALIESIN: You've been holding onto that Speak and
Spell thing for so long.

04:33:08.299 --> 04:33:13.152
MATT: I can't believe you maintained that voice
for that long. That was amazing.

04:33:13.152 --> 04:33:15.734
MARISHA: I haven't laughed that hard in so long.

04:33:15.734 --> 04:33:23.075
MATT: And let this be a point of inspiration for
any of you burgeoning DMs out there. That's

04:33:23.075 --> 04:33:27.402
exactly the point. You are always frightened to
death to do it, but you have to pull the trigger

04:33:27.402 --> 04:33:30.645
and jump in anyway because magic happens.

04:33:30.645 --> 04:33:32.564
ASHLEY: I love you, Liam O'Brien.

04:33:32.564 --> 04:33:34.193
MATT: I love you, man. That was amazing.

04:33:34.193 --> 04:33:35.959
MARISHA: Speak and Spell Liam!

04:33:35.959 --> 04:33:38.966
LIAM: What was the word? What was it you asked me
to spell? Farm what?

04:33:38.966 --> 04:33:40.454
ALL: Farmhouse.

04:33:40.454 --> 04:33:44.720
LIAM: (speak-and-spell voice) "Farmhouse. 
F-A-R-M-H-O-U-S-E. Farmhouse."

04:33:44.720 --> 04:33:45.888
MATT: Thank you.

04:33:45.888 --> 04:33:47.572
LIAM: I'm out of steam, though.

04:33:47.572 --> 04:33:49.785
TALIESIN: You've been showing that off for so
fucking long.

04:33:49.785 --> 04:33:52.318
LIAM: Yeah, in little dribs and drabs, and I
finally found a way to use it.

04:33:52.318 --> 04:33:56.364
MARISHA: What was that, like 20 minutes?

04:33:56.364 --> 04:33:59.304
TRAVIS: I couldn't breathe. I could not breathe.

04:33:59.304 --> 04:34:02.445
LIAM: I mean, when I do it for ten seconds in
recording studios, you crack up.

04:34:02.445 --> 04:34:04.188
TRAVIS: I was in trouble.

04:34:04.188 --> 04:34:07.590
ASHLEY: I haven't heard you laugh that loud in a
long time. You were not able to hold it together.

04:34:07.590 --> 04:34:09.083
That was beautiful.

04:34:09.083 --> 04:34:13.424
LIAM: Man, I need to go see my therapist after
that game.

04:34:13.424 --> 04:34:16.016
SAM: That was your therapy.

04:34:16.016 --> 04:34:17.314
LIAM: Yes, it was.

04:34:17.314 --> 04:34:18.743
TALIESIN: That was so amazing.

04:34:18.743 --> 04:34:24.974
LIAM: Thank you for coming along. Laura, I hope
you're feeling better. And guys, is it the day

04:34:24.974 --> 04:34:27.208
before Wednesday day yet?

04:34:27.208 --> 04:34:30.020
(laughter)

04:34:30.020 --> 04:42:27.498
